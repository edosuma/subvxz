00:02.570 --> 00:03.936
Miss?

00:03.938 --> 00:05.971
I have to apologize.

00:05.973 --> 00:07.940
Well, not to me, but I'm sure
the Amish are pissed

00:07.942 --> 00:12.478
that you're gaying up
their look.

00:12.480 --> 00:14.980
I don't have enough
money for the tip.

00:14.982 --> 00:17.383
Weird. You survive
the diner chili,

00:17.385 --> 00:20.119
and it's the waitress
that kills you!

00:20.121 --> 00:23.355
But I can tip another way.
I'm a psychic.

00:23.357 --> 00:24.790
So, uh, you already know

00:24.792 --> 00:27.359
where they're gonna
find your body.

00:27.361 --> 00:29.395
Oh, please.
I die in a bridge collapse

00:29.397 --> 00:31.630
you have nothing to do with.

00:31.632 --> 00:34.400
I can tell you your future.

00:34.402 --> 00:36.368
Ha! You're wrong.
I don't have one.

00:38.339 --> 00:40.205
See the guy
in the booth over there?

00:40.207 --> 00:42.908
Jared "Leto Himself Go"?

00:42.910 --> 00:46.078
He just offered to read
my future as my tip!

00:46.080 --> 00:48.047
Ha! You don't
have one.

00:51.419 --> 00:53.385
Miss, let me read
your palm.

00:53.387 --> 00:56.422
Sir, coming over here
right now is not a good idea.

00:56.424 --> 00:58.657
We don't like to be
stiffed by strangers.

00:58.659 --> 01:01.260
In six months, maybe,
but we're not there yet.

01:01.262 --> 01:03.429
I'm a legit psychic.

01:03.431 --> 01:05.330
I predicted long hair
was coming back

01:05.332 --> 01:08.534
in time to have long hair
when it did.

01:08.536 --> 01:09.835
Okay. You can read
my palm.

01:09.837 --> 01:11.437
I could use some good news.

01:11.439 --> 01:14.940
I could also use some
hand moisturizer--sorry.

01:14.942 --> 01:17.342
I see two Ms?

01:17.344 --> 01:20.479
You bitch! Have you
been holding out on M&M's?

01:22.516 --> 01:25.884
Ooh! Is it the male model

01:25.886 --> 01:27.219
I'm managing

01:27.221 --> 01:31.623
who's also
making it with Max?

01:31.625 --> 01:35.360
Actually...I see
a small failure.

01:39.233 --> 01:43.869
I take it back.
You are good!

01:43.871 --> 01:45.204

01:59.587 --> 02:02.654
Here's your
chocolate lemon crumble.

02:02.656 --> 02:05.657
Sounds like it shouldn't
work together, but it does.

02:05.659 --> 02:08.460
It's the Tony Bennett
and Lady Gaga of desserts.

02:08.462 --> 02:11.497
Max, can I have
just a wee bite?

02:11.499 --> 02:12.998
A crumble of the crumble?

02:13.000 --> 02:14.433
Caroline won't let me
eat anything

02:14.435 --> 02:15.934
because of my big
photo shoot.

02:15.936 --> 02:17.669
[sighs]
Hurry!

02:17.671 --> 02:19.938
No chewing, no enjoying.
Just swallow.

02:19.940 --> 02:21.773
Spit that out!

02:21.775 --> 02:22.941
No!

02:22.943 --> 02:24.977
I said spit that out!

02:24.979 --> 02:28.447
You're a model now!
Shame on you!

02:28.449 --> 02:30.482
Bitch, he's starving.

02:31.685 --> 02:33.519
He's not eating, is he?

02:33.521 --> 02:35.287
I don't want
the Stay Puft Marshmallow man

02:35.289 --> 02:38.657
showing up
at my girlfriend's photo shoot.

02:38.659 --> 02:41.093
I haven't eaten anything
since Tuesday!

02:41.095 --> 02:43.295
This morning, he tried
to swallow his toothpaste,

02:43.297 --> 02:45.164
but I was right there
to stop him.

02:45.166 --> 02:46.665
Good, honey.

02:46.667 --> 02:48.600
That kind of heartlessness
is why I've decided

02:48.602 --> 02:50.502
to make you the manager
of our hot new location

02:50.504 --> 02:51.770
of the High.

02:51.772 --> 02:55.274
Oh, my God!
This is so exciting!

02:55.276 --> 02:57.643
Someone's finally realizing
my full potential,

02:57.645 --> 03:00.012
and it's not me!

03:00.014 --> 03:02.514
Will I be able to make Max
head pastry chef?

03:02.516 --> 03:05.184
And where is
this new location?

03:05.186 --> 03:06.985
Well, right now,
everything's under wraps

03:06.987 --> 03:09.121
the way my face was
six months ago.

03:09.123 --> 03:11.523
But as manager,
you can hire your own staff,

03:11.525 --> 03:13.225
and I'll even let you
poach Max.

03:13.227 --> 03:15.294
I'll also tell you

03:15.296 --> 03:17.329
the new spot is amazing.

03:17.331 --> 03:19.898
It's international.
It's a hub.

03:19.900 --> 03:22.167
I'm talking
major flagship.

03:22.169 --> 03:24.403
Honey, I get that
you're happy,

03:24.405 --> 03:26.705
but enough with
the eye contact.

03:26.707 --> 03:28.874
No one can look me
in the eye.

03:28.876 --> 03:32.644
I'm the Medusa in Chanel.

03:32.646 --> 03:34.379
Max doesn't let me
look her in the eyes

03:34.381 --> 03:35.681
during sex either.

03:35.683 --> 03:37.849
I told you,
eye contact's extra.

03:37.851 --> 03:40.919
Max, did you hear that?

03:40.921 --> 03:42.721
Major flagship!

03:42.723 --> 03:46.391
Uh, did someone just
call me a major flag?

03:46.393 --> 03:48.093
I think you did,
and if I don't get to

03:48.095 --> 03:50.028
go to the new place
with you two,

03:50.030 --> 03:51.597
I'm telling HR.

03:51.599 --> 03:55.400
That's Hector Rodriguez,
my therapist.

03:55.402 --> 03:57.369
Would you be interested
in coming to the new High

03:57.371 --> 03:59.071
as part of our team?

03:59.073 --> 04:00.606
If you say
"part of our team" again,

04:00.608 --> 04:01.940
I'll rethink
the whole thing.

04:01.942 --> 04:03.242
I'll take it.

04:03.244 --> 04:04.776
But I have to be
upfront with Max.

04:04.778 --> 04:06.378
I don't like it
in the back.

04:06.380 --> 04:10.282
Which, by the way, is what
I say to all my dates.

04:10.284 --> 04:11.817
Samesies!

04:13.354 --> 04:15.287
Well, this is great news.

04:15.289 --> 04:17.256
How about we celebrate
with a piece of pie?

04:17.258 --> 04:18.991
No!

04:23.297 --> 04:25.564
Earl, we have great news.
Guess what it is.

04:25.566 --> 04:28.467
No, don't. Okay, guess.
No, don't. Yes, guess, guess!

04:28.469 --> 04:29.901
Can we hurry this along?

04:29.903 --> 04:32.137
My cousin is on
<i>Maury Povich</i> today,

04:32.139 --> 04:35.707
and I wanna find out
if he's the father.

04:35.709 --> 04:38.944
'Cause then I can stop
paying child support.

04:38.946 --> 04:41.313
Sorry.
She's a little amped.

04:41.315 --> 04:43.382
She hasn't had
good news to share

04:43.384 --> 04:45.050
since we found out
the washing machine

04:45.052 --> 04:47.953
in our basement
takes buttons.

04:47.955 --> 04:49.988
Han! We have good news.

04:49.990 --> 04:51.490
Sure, you do.

04:51.492 --> 04:54.126
And I'm playing center
for the New York Knicks!

04:54.128 --> 04:56.161
Have you seen the Knicks
lately?

04:56.163 --> 04:58.630
He can only help.

04:58.632 --> 05:00.766
Well, according
to my time card,

05:00.768 --> 05:02.668
I've been here
for six hours already,

05:02.670 --> 05:05.137
so I'm gonna head back
and catch some Zs.

05:05.139 --> 05:07.906
The Mattress
is all yours, Max.

05:09.443 --> 05:12.978
Hey, everybody.
We weren't expecting company.

05:12.980 --> 05:14.913
I came by

05:14.915 --> 05:16.848
to discuss wedding details
with Oleg

05:16.850 --> 05:19.484
while we had intercourse.

05:19.486 --> 05:22.487
What is this,
the Bunny Ranch?

05:22.489 --> 05:25.023
Baby, I think these
are yours.

05:27.761 --> 05:29.294
Yeah.

05:29.296 --> 05:32.998
Yeah. Why, thank you,
honey.

05:33.000 --> 05:35.267
Can we just make it
a general rule

05:35.269 --> 05:38.970
that there's no fornication
in the diner?

05:38.972 --> 05:41.473
Or in Han's apartment,
ever.

05:41.475 --> 05:44.843
Okay, Max and I have some
really exciting news.

05:44.845 --> 05:47.412
Yeah, yeah.
We know all about the buttons.

05:49.850 --> 05:51.450
Oleg!

05:51.452 --> 05:54.453
I think you crushed
my seating arrangement!

05:54.455 --> 05:56.421
I'd like to think so.

05:59.693 --> 06:00.726
So, back to us.

06:00.728 --> 06:02.527
How 'bout back to work?

06:02.529 --> 06:04.629
Max and I...

06:04.631 --> 06:06.865
Need to do some work!

06:06.867 --> 06:08.600
There. End of news.

06:11.672 --> 06:14.373
Where are you running
off to so fast?

06:14.375 --> 06:17.576
Is someone having a sale
on smaller heads?

06:17.578 --> 06:21.079
I'm too small,
I'm too big--pick one!

06:21.081 --> 06:22.748
Here's our big news.

06:22.750 --> 06:24.549
You are looking at
the manager

06:24.551 --> 06:28.420
and the head pastry chef
of the brand-new High location.

06:28.422 --> 06:31.656
Actually, he's looking
at our kneecaps.

06:31.658 --> 06:33.759
Okay, so we're going with
too small.

06:33.761 --> 06:38.196
If you two quit the diner,
how will I ever replace you?

06:38.198 --> 06:40.899
Unless I hire...
literally anyone else!

06:42.770 --> 06:45.036
No, Han, we still
have to work here at night.

06:45.038 --> 06:46.772
We have more debt
than Jada Pinkett-Smith

06:46.774 --> 06:50.375
has excuses
for Will not being home.

06:50.377 --> 06:52.444
But at the new High,

06:52.446 --> 06:54.079
we're gonna be
the big bosses

06:54.081 --> 06:55.580
calling all the shots.

06:55.582 --> 06:58.417
Yes, yes...by day.

06:58.419 --> 07:02.287
But by night,
you'll be the coleslaw's bitch.

07:03.424 --> 07:05.524
Don't listen to him.

07:05.526 --> 07:07.859
Clearly, Han just
resents our success.

07:07.861 --> 07:12.464
I know! Why can't women ever
just be happy for each other?

07:20.107 --> 07:21.106
Wow, that is really hot.

07:21.108 --> 07:22.441
Yeah.

07:22.443 --> 07:25.710
The milder salsa's
right here.

07:25.712 --> 07:27.779
Listen--oh!

07:27.781 --> 07:29.614
Do girls eat now?

07:30.951 --> 07:35.253
Wow! Lena Dunham
changed everything!

07:35.255 --> 07:37.923
Listen, which one of you
is sleeping with the model?

07:37.925 --> 07:39.891
I know one of you said
you were,

07:39.893 --> 07:41.893
but I don't listen
when you talk.

07:41.895 --> 07:44.596
[muffled]
She is.

07:44.598 --> 07:46.965
This is a massive ad campaign,

07:46.967 --> 07:49.167
and I don't know
how else to say this,

07:49.169 --> 07:52.571
but I need his penis
to look bigger.

07:52.573 --> 07:54.439
Oh! Yeah...

07:54.441 --> 07:58.243
It gets nervous when
you shine a light on it.

07:58.245 --> 08:00.946
Sometimes I hear her coaxing
it out of its crawl space

08:00.948 --> 08:02.981
with treats.

08:02.983 --> 08:04.449
Well, do something.

08:04.451 --> 08:06.251
I haven't touched one
since college,

08:06.253 --> 08:09.821
and even then it was just
to look under it for my keys.

08:09.823 --> 08:12.290
Max, take him off set.
Be professional.

08:12.292 --> 08:14.125
How professional
can I be?

08:14.127 --> 08:16.828
She's asking me
to fluff his nutter.

08:16.830 --> 08:18.563
Yo, Nash!
Break time.

08:19.700 --> 08:21.600
So...Marie.

08:21.602 --> 08:24.269
Did Joe tell you about
my big new job promotion?

08:24.271 --> 08:26.271
Of course she did.
We're lesbians.

08:26.273 --> 08:29.140
Talking is most of
what we do.

08:29.142 --> 08:31.510
It's why we rule daytime.

08:32.713 --> 08:34.779
(Irish accent)
Eh...pardon me.

08:34.781 --> 08:39.317
You, maybe.
That coat--never.

08:39.319 --> 08:41.319
I'm lookin' for someone.

08:41.321 --> 08:45.123
You also look like an extra
from<i> Angela's Ashes.</i>

08:45.125 --> 08:46.791
But this is a private shoot,

08:46.793 --> 08:49.961
as in we're shooting
someone's privates.

08:49.963 --> 08:51.796
I'm looking for me son.

08:51.798 --> 08:56.535
Okay, people!
The groundhog's outta the hole!

08:56.537 --> 08:59.804
Six more inches of winter.

08:59.806 --> 09:02.140
That's him!
That's me boy!

09:02.142 --> 09:03.542
Ma?

09:03.544 --> 09:05.210
Huh?

09:05.212 --> 09:07.646
Ma, how did you know
I was in New York?

09:07.648 --> 09:09.381
Aw, no, you saw me in
the<i> Today Show</i> window,

09:09.383 --> 09:11.216
didn't ya?

09:11.218 --> 09:13.919
You checked into "America"
on Facebook,

09:13.921 --> 09:15.654
you bleedin' idiot.

09:15.656 --> 09:18.890
I flew all the way and been
lookin' for you day and night

09:18.892 --> 09:21.993
in this dirty, God forsaken
city for a week.

09:21.995 --> 09:23.929
I'm takin' you home.

09:23.931 --> 09:26.197
Ma'am, Nash can make
his own decisions.

09:26.199 --> 09:27.532
He's a grown man.

09:27.534 --> 09:30.268
Yep. Thanks to my handiwork.

09:30.270 --> 09:33.538
He's no grown man.
He's just now 18.

09:33.540 --> 09:37.509
He's got his prom
next month!

09:37.511 --> 09:38.610
I can't believe it!

09:38.612 --> 09:41.046
I had sex with a teenager!

09:41.048 --> 09:43.748
Who am I, Woody Allen?

09:43.750 --> 09:46.718
Roman Polanski?

09:46.720 --> 09:50.288
Pretty much any of your
big-time '70s movie directors?

09:50.290 --> 09:53.058
You had sex
with me innocent child?

09:53.060 --> 09:55.026
Uh, not so innocent.

09:55.028 --> 09:56.561
He made me blush
a few times,

09:56.563 --> 10:00.065
and I have two positions
named after me.

10:00.067 --> 10:01.900
Well, that's that.

10:01.902 --> 10:05.737
You've seen the last of
big booby dirty girl here.

10:05.739 --> 10:09.741
I'd object, but when you're
right, you're right.

10:09.743 --> 10:11.943
But Ma,
I like New York.

10:11.945 --> 10:14.879
People want to take
pictures of me willy here.

10:14.881 --> 10:16.414
This is all me fault.

10:16.416 --> 10:19.517
I should have never let you
watch that<i> Magic Mike.</i>

10:21.989 --> 10:23.421
That's great.

10:23.423 --> 10:25.123
I don't have a model now.

10:25.125 --> 10:27.125
I'm Seal.

10:27.127 --> 10:29.828
Wait until
I tell Joe about this.

10:29.830 --> 10:32.564
How can you not know
how old he is?

10:32.566 --> 10:35.634
Uh...what can I say?
We're a typical couple!

10:35.636 --> 10:39.504
He lied about his age, and I
pretended he was interesting.

10:41.775 --> 10:43.742
Okay, Max, when Joe gets here,

10:43.744 --> 10:44.943
I'm just gonna tell her

10:44.945 --> 10:46.945
that me managing
an underage twink

10:46.947 --> 10:49.447
has nothing to do
with me managing her restaurant

10:49.449 --> 10:52.450
which sells overpriced
twink...ies.

10:52.452 --> 10:54.819
Yeah. I'm sure she'll
be professional about it all.

10:54.821 --> 10:56.021
Professional?

10:56.023 --> 10:57.756
Yesterday, she slapped
a woman in here

10:57.758 --> 10:59.624
for wearing cheap heels.

10:59.626 --> 11:02.394
I know.
My face is still red.

11:03.530 --> 11:04.996
Here she is.

11:04.998 --> 11:06.331
Good morning, Joe!

11:06.333 --> 11:07.866
Hey, ladies.

11:07.868 --> 11:10.435
Well, obviously,
you're both fired.

11:10.437 --> 11:12.103
Obviously.

11:12.105 --> 11:13.371
Can I keep the hat?

11:13.373 --> 11:15.340
You are not gonna
want this back.

11:15.342 --> 11:18.276
My head sweats like
a watermelon at a picnic.

11:18.278 --> 11:21.112
Please don't fire us
over the Nash situation.

11:21.114 --> 11:23.114
It was out of our hands.

11:23.116 --> 11:25.016
Actually,
it was in her hands,

11:25.018 --> 11:27.118
and it was only 18.

11:27.120 --> 11:29.487
You two embarrassed
my girlfriend.

11:29.489 --> 11:31.389
And embarrassment
in the lesbian community

11:31.391 --> 11:33.358
is worse than
not owning a dog.

11:33.360 --> 11:36.494
It's worse than dating
Anne Heche.

11:36.496 --> 11:40.231
Oh, my God.
We committed a Heche crime.

11:40.233 --> 11:42.167
How can we make it better?

11:42.169 --> 11:44.636
Just get that kid back
to the photo shoot tomorrow,

11:44.638 --> 11:46.638
and we're back in business.

11:46.640 --> 11:48.173
And Max, next time,

11:48.175 --> 11:51.509
stay out of his
barely legal business.

11:51.511 --> 11:53.344
Done. Don't know how,
but done.

11:53.346 --> 11:54.813
You won't be sorry.

11:54.815 --> 11:56.981
Just get him back,
'cause I gotta tell ya...

11:56.983 --> 11:59.184
Marie's crying face?

11:59.186 --> 12:00.919
Not for me.

12:06.526 --> 12:08.259
Well, coleslaw...

12:08.261 --> 12:09.694
just when I thought
I was out,

12:09.696 --> 12:12.931
you pulled me back in
again.

12:12.933 --> 12:15.200
Max, don't tell
the coleslaw that.

12:15.202 --> 12:17.368
Don't give it that power.

12:17.370 --> 12:19.704
My plan to get Nash back
will work.

12:19.706 --> 12:21.873
We still have a bright,
bright future.

12:21.875 --> 12:24.509
Yes! By day.

12:25.779 --> 12:27.078
Han!

12:27.080 --> 12:28.613
Do you want to spend
another night

12:28.615 --> 12:30.048
in this coleslaw bucket?

12:30.050 --> 12:31.416
No. And had I not
been able to

12:31.418 --> 12:33.051
roll myself
out to the street,

12:33.053 --> 12:35.120
I might have
suffocated!

12:38.859 --> 12:41.226
Nash and his mom
will be here any minute, Max.

12:41.228 --> 12:44.429
Do you really need to expose
60% of your boobs?

12:44.431 --> 12:45.897
It's not up to me.

12:45.899 --> 12:48.533
These girls have a life
of their own.

12:51.705 --> 12:56.040
The right one just started
a Fleetwood Mac cover band.

12:56.042 --> 12:57.742
You know how I know?

12:57.744 --> 13:01.112
'Cause when I take my bra off,
it goes its own way.

13:04.251 --> 13:06.251
Do you really think
you can get Nash's mother

13:06.253 --> 13:08.086
to change her mind
when they come in

13:08.088 --> 13:09.220
to pick up the rest of
his stuff?

13:09.222 --> 13:10.622
Yes, I do.

13:10.624 --> 13:12.090
Because she and I
have a lot in common.

13:12.092 --> 13:14.159
I may not be Irish,
but I'm dirt poor,

13:14.161 --> 13:17.495
and I'm living with someone
who drinks way too much.

13:17.497 --> 13:19.230
(Oleg)
Max, look.

13:19.232 --> 13:20.331
All those purple post-its

13:20.333 --> 13:22.834
are Sophie's friends and family.

13:22.836 --> 13:24.803
My family's
nowhere to be seen!

13:24.805 --> 13:28.006
It's like I'm looking at
the last U.S. census!

13:28.008 --> 13:29.974
Hey, girls.
Come over here.

13:29.976 --> 13:32.977
We need your help
with the seating chart.

13:32.979 --> 13:35.246
Yeah. You know, planning
a wedding is more work

13:35.248 --> 13:39.284
than waxing Oleg's back
during a full moon.

13:39.286 --> 13:41.486
Sophie, I have my own
issue right now.

13:41.488 --> 13:43.488
Okay. Then Max
can help me with the chart

13:43.490 --> 13:46.658
while you go worry about
your obviously thinning hair.

13:48.495 --> 13:50.195
Uh, full disclosure--

13:50.197 --> 13:52.497
the last time someone asked me
to help them with something,

13:52.499 --> 13:55.633
I free-based
half their beard off.

13:55.635 --> 13:58.536
[chime]

13:58.538 --> 14:00.371
I just got a text
from Nash.

14:00.373 --> 14:03.474
He's here? I'll go get him
a kid's menu.

14:03.476 --> 14:04.776
They're not coming.

14:04.778 --> 14:08.112
His mom found the racy
pictures I sent him.

14:08.114 --> 14:10.181
"Flying out of JFK
tomorrow.

14:10.183 --> 14:12.550
Taking the morning
Aer Lingus"?

14:12.552 --> 14:15.119
A little morning
"Aer Lingus"?

14:15.121 --> 14:18.790
Isn't that what got Max
in trouble in the first place?

14:20.360 --> 14:22.327
Okay, well, we just
have to go to the airport

14:22.329 --> 14:23.995
and stop them.

14:23.997 --> 14:25.830
I'll buy us plane tickets
and then return them,

14:25.832 --> 14:29.400
like I do with shoes or
Tom Cruise does with wives.

14:31.338 --> 14:33.738
Jackets and shoes off!

14:33.740 --> 14:36.307
And make sure you check
all your pockets.

14:36.309 --> 14:39.477
Don't make me shut this airport
down for a piece of gum.

14:41.081 --> 14:44.816
This line is longer
than the movie<i> Gone Girl.</i>

14:46.987 --> 14:51.723
What does TSA stand for?
"Time Stands A-still?"

14:51.725 --> 14:54.425
That's cute.
Never heard that one before.

14:54.427 --> 14:57.562
Most people just go with
"This Sucks Ass."

14:58.999 --> 15:01.032
Max, please don't
yell out again.

15:01.034 --> 15:02.901
People get very jumpy
in airports.

15:02.903 --> 15:05.536
Oh, what? It's not like
I screamed, "I have a bomb!"

15:05.538 --> 15:08.673
Miss, will you step
over here, please?

15:08.675 --> 15:11.576
Oh, I was kidding.
I don't have a bomb.

15:11.578 --> 15:14.646
But I have been known
to...be da bomb.

15:15.882 --> 15:18.049
Max!

15:18.051 --> 15:19.417
Please, please,
if we step away,

15:19.419 --> 15:21.352
we'll lose our place
in line.

15:21.354 --> 15:24.389
I know it sounds like
we're here to blow up a plane,

15:24.391 --> 15:26.424
but we're really just here
to stop an underage kid

15:26.426 --> 15:30.061
she had sex with
from leaving the country.

15:30.063 --> 15:32.196
So I should just come
over there now.

15:32.198 --> 15:34.432
Yep.
You just been hand-picked

15:34.434 --> 15:37.769
to join the "I don't trust you"
dance party.

15:40.540 --> 15:42.907
May I see your tickets?

15:42.909 --> 15:45.610
Nice day.
I like your hair.

15:45.612 --> 15:47.879
Thanks. We're allowed
to be creative

15:47.881 --> 15:51.549
from the neck up.

15:51.551 --> 15:54.319
Ooh! You traveling
to Paris.

15:54.321 --> 15:56.387
First-class.

15:56.389 --> 15:58.890
In those jeans?

15:58.892 --> 16:01.592
You got first-class
tickets to Paris?

16:01.594 --> 16:03.227
Are you insane?

16:03.229 --> 16:04.495
My fingers did it.

16:04.497 --> 16:06.431
It was rich girl
cellular memory.

16:06.433 --> 16:08.466
And if we're not
going anywhere,

16:08.468 --> 16:10.301
why can't we
not go to Paris?

16:10.303 --> 16:12.136
And why can't we not
go to the Louvre?

16:12.138 --> 16:13.838
And why can't we not
stay in the penthouse

16:13.840 --> 16:16.507
at the George Cinq
and not order room service?

16:16.509 --> 16:20.411
Is it too late for me
to say I don't know her?

16:20.413 --> 16:22.814
Ma'am, are you carrying
any explosives?

16:22.816 --> 16:24.482
I had leftover Chipotle
for breakfast.

16:24.484 --> 16:27.819
Does that count?

16:27.821 --> 16:30.922
It does to whoever's
sitting next to you.

16:32.859 --> 16:34.959
(woman, French accent)
Air France flight 113

16:34.961 --> 16:36.761
will now begin boarding
at gate 24.

16:36.763 --> 16:38.262
Max! That's our flight.

16:38.264 --> 16:40.665
(bad French accent)
Air France, flight 113.

16:40.667 --> 16:42.100
Ooh! I bet on the plane,

16:42.102 --> 16:44.435
they'll have caviar
and Bellinis.

16:44.437 --> 16:46.137
You know what won't
be on the plane?

16:46.139 --> 16:47.972
Us!

16:47.974 --> 16:49.307
We're not going!

16:49.309 --> 16:50.942
Have you been smoking
the half joint

16:50.944 --> 16:53.277
I have hidden
in my bra?

16:53.279 --> 16:54.946
You have a joint?

16:54.948 --> 16:57.715
Bank account? Ha!

16:57.717 --> 17:00.385
You went through security
with pot?

17:00.387 --> 17:03.054
I went through
third grade with pot.

17:03.056 --> 17:05.223
There he is.
There's Nash.

17:05.225 --> 17:07.025
I'm sure his mom
is asking

17:07.027 --> 17:10.361
if he can visit the cockpit
and meet the pilot.

17:10.363 --> 17:13.231
Wow. He's young.

17:13.233 --> 17:14.866
So young, Bruce Jenner
has been a woman

17:14.868 --> 17:17.135
for most of his life.

17:17.137 --> 17:19.837
Nash!
Please.

17:19.839 --> 17:22.173
You can't go.
Our entire lives depend on

17:22.175 --> 17:24.075
you finishing
that photo shoot.

17:24.077 --> 17:26.911
Nash Terrence O'Brien,
you're not going anywhere.

17:26.913 --> 17:29.147
Or I'll take you
over my knee right here.

17:29.149 --> 17:31.349
Well, he likes that.

17:31.351 --> 17:33.184
Well, you...

17:33.186 --> 17:36.921
You are just loose
as a goose, aren't ya?

17:38.558 --> 17:41.025
Again...when you're
right, you're right.

17:41.027 --> 17:44.896
Max, let me talk
to Mrs. O'Brien.

17:44.898 --> 17:46.364
Go up to the gate.

17:46.366 --> 17:47.832
Ask what movie they're
showing on their flight.

17:47.834 --> 17:49.500
Okay, but if they're showing
anything,

17:49.502 --> 17:51.602
and I mean<i> anything</i>

17:51.604 --> 17:54.238
from Mr. Adam Sandler...

17:54.240 --> 17:56.274
I'm getting on the plane too.

17:58.344 --> 18:00.878
Please.
I'm begging you.

18:00.880 --> 18:02.547
You don't know me.
I'm a proud woman.

18:02.549 --> 18:04.549
The only other time
I ever begged

18:04.551 --> 18:07.618
was to get off
of P. Diddy's yacht.

18:07.620 --> 18:10.121
I mean, a party
shouldn't be three days long.

18:10.123 --> 18:11.689
Miss, you can save
your silly breath.

18:11.691 --> 18:13.791
I'm taking him home.

18:13.793 --> 18:17.295
Would passenger Maeve O'Brien
please report to the gate desk?

18:17.297 --> 18:19.730
Oh, Nash, maybe
they're bumping us up

18:19.732 --> 18:23.234
from the last coach row to the
second to the last coach row!

18:23.236 --> 18:25.703
I knew I'd be rewarded
for not having any abortions

18:25.705 --> 18:28.306
in spite of me circumstances.

18:30.243 --> 18:31.709
Grab Nash--let's get
out of here

18:31.711 --> 18:33.111
while I got her
distracted.

18:33.113 --> 18:35.379
Max, you did that?
How?

18:35.381 --> 18:37.882
I no longer have
the half a joint in my bra.

18:37.884 --> 18:41.385
You bribed an airline
employee with a joint?

18:41.387 --> 18:45.156
Pain? Oh, you really gotta
stretch out for that.

18:45.158 --> 18:47.125
Max, this is kidnapping.

18:47.127 --> 18:49.794
Oh, he's not that young.
When I was his age,

18:49.796 --> 18:52.463
I had already robbed
three Blockbuster videos.

18:52.465 --> 18:54.232
What's Blockbuster video?

18:56.136 --> 18:59.504
Oh, my God,
I screwed a baby.

18:59.506 --> 19:02.006
Okay. I'm gonna text Joe
and tell her we have Nash

19:02.008 --> 19:04.475
in our custody.
No, I'd better call.

19:04.477 --> 19:08.312
That text won't play well
at our trial.

19:08.314 --> 19:11.149
I'm sorry I didn't tell ya
I was so young.

19:11.151 --> 19:13.117
But honestly, I didn't
think it mattered

19:13.119 --> 19:15.319
since you're so immature.

19:17.323 --> 19:19.590
I know you are,
but what am I?

19:20.827 --> 19:22.460
Okay, so Joe was
really impressed

19:22.462 --> 19:24.829
with the kidnapping,
and she gave us our jobs back.

19:24.831 --> 19:26.264
But Nash,
you've been replaced.

19:26.266 --> 19:27.765
They found another model

19:27.767 --> 19:29.700
who wouldn't give them
any parent trouble--

19:29.702 --> 19:32.303
a well-hung orphan.

19:32.305 --> 19:34.172
A well-hung orphan.

19:34.174 --> 19:37.275
Well, the Lord gives
and the Lord takes.

19:37.277 --> 19:38.876
So what now?

19:38.878 --> 19:41.546
Well, you go back to Ireland
and brag to your friends

19:41.548 --> 19:44.549
about having sex with someone
who once had sex

19:44.551 --> 19:48.486
with Axl Rose's
best friend's son.

19:48.488 --> 19:49.820
Good-bye, Max.

19:49.822 --> 19:52.657
Later, Nash Potater.

19:52.659 --> 19:55.726
You know, I think
I'm gonna miss him.

19:55.728 --> 19:59.697
Especially since kids
eat free at Quiznos before 6:00.

19:59.699 --> 20:02.166
Ugh! Let's get out
of here.

20:02.168 --> 20:03.801
The only good thing
about airports

20:03.803 --> 20:06.170
is leaving them
for someplace better.

20:06.172 --> 20:09.240
Max, next time we're here,
I'm gonna take you to Paris.

20:09.242 --> 20:11.209
Well, first take me
to the bathroom.

20:11.211 --> 20:13.844
I've had to pee since
our tram hit that pothole.

20:13.846 --> 20:16.581
Well, at least we're gonna
be working somewhere with class.

20:16.583 --> 20:18.216
I wonder where it is.

20:18.218 --> 20:22.486
Joe said it's a real hub,
flagship, international.

20:22.488 --> 20:26.490
Yeah. It's gonna be
international terminal 8!

20:28.328 --> 20:29.894
What?

20:29.896 --> 20:31.662
Here?

20:31.664 --> 20:33.898
We're working here?

20:33.900 --> 20:35.700
I've got to find out
who I brutally murdered

20:35.702 --> 20:38.536
in a previous life
and make it up to him or her.

20:38.538 --> 20:40.771
This sucks!
The one place

20:40.773 --> 20:44.342
no one will<i> ever</i>
give us a ride to work!

20:44.344 --> 20:48.579
(female announcer)
Final boarding for Air France,
flight 113.

20:48.581 --> 20:50.715
Of course it is.

20:50.717 --> 20:53.851
Look at the bright side.
These days, most planes

20:53.853 --> 20:56.554
don't even make it to where
they're supposed to go.

20:56.556 --> 20:59.023
(announcer)
Paging first-class passengers
Caroline Channing

20:59.025 --> 21:01.225
and Max Black.

21:01.227 --> 21:03.494
Those rich bitches
are so lucky!
