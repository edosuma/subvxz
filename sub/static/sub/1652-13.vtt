               .

00:02.503 --> 00:04.403
     - Colombian hit squad.
      - .22 hollow point.

00:04.405 --> 00:06.071
  - It's an assassin's bullet.

00:06.073 --> 00:07.506
   - Somebody wanted a bigger
        piece of the pie

00:07.508 --> 00:08.507
          For himself?
        - Gustav munoz.

00:08.509 --> 00:10.042
  - Find out where in my city

00:10.044 --> 00:11.310
        This guy thinks
          he can hide.

00:11.312 --> 00:13.078
  - You remember pulpo, right?

00:13.080 --> 00:15.381
     - He kidnapped my son.

00:15.383 --> 00:17.149
      - He's pulling pulpo
            off mcc

00:17.151 --> 00:20.019
 And using him as bait to draw
         gustav munoz.

00:20.021 --> 00:22.254
      - What's up with you
   and rebel without a cause?

00:22.256 --> 00:23.389
    - Nothing. He's engaged.

00:23.391 --> 00:25.324
           - [laughs]
          my fiancee.

00:25.326 --> 00:26.458
  - You're gonna tie the knot,
              huh?

00:26.460 --> 00:28.327
  - I'm just sick of planning.

00:28.329 --> 00:30.162
 - Who called internal affairs?

00:30.164 --> 00:32.031
  - You said this is gonna be
         a partnership.

00:32.033 --> 00:34.400
   There's a lotta different
     kinds of partnerships.

00:36.102 --> 00:38.170
   - I have 8 people working
         underneath me

00:38.172 --> 00:40.372
      And another 12 cops
       that report to me.

00:40.374 --> 00:44.710
     Guess who takes up 75%
          of my time?

00:44.712 --> 00:46.645
    Your gravely-voiced ass.

00:46.647 --> 00:49.114
 - You know, I'd like to think
 the arrest record of my unit--

00:49.116 --> 00:52.284
  It's measured on the number
    of arrests that you make

00:52.286 --> 00:54.186
     Working in conjunction
     with internal affairs,

00:54.188 --> 00:57.723
          And so far,
      that number's one--

00:57.725 --> 00:59.625
         Maurice owens.

01:01.194 --> 01:04.797
     I know for a fact that
 you're out there on the street

01:04.799 --> 01:08.667
     And I can only imagine
  how much money you've taken

01:08.669 --> 01:11.670
       And not vouchered.

01:11.672 --> 01:14.306
  - Sounds like you're getting
    some fuzzy intel, edwin,

01:14.308 --> 01:17.509
      - I have a solution
         as to how you

01:17.511 --> 01:20.112
    Can start working it off
       more effectively.

01:20.114 --> 01:21.413
 There's a narcotics detective

01:21.415 --> 01:23.182
   That we've had our eye on
        for some time--

01:23.184 --> 01:24.483
 - I don't go after other cops.

01:24.485 --> 01:26.185
    That was the first thing
        out of my mouth

01:26.187 --> 01:27.586
When I made my little deal here,

01:27.588 --> 01:30.556
   So you can shake your ass
         all you want.

01:30.558 --> 01:34.326
      That ain't changing.

01:34.328 --> 01:37.863
    - You will give me more,
      or you will be gone.

01:37.865 --> 01:40.399
    First and final warning.

01:44.671 --> 01:46.472
          - Hey, adam.

01:46.474 --> 01:47.639
             - Hey.

01:50.376 --> 01:51.810
            Burgess?
            - Yeah?

01:51.812 --> 01:53.278
      - You got a second?
       Can I talk to you?

01:53.280 --> 01:56.115
            - Sure.

01:56.117 --> 01:57.483
   - How's your niece doing?

01:57.485 --> 01:59.351
     - She's doing better.
           Thank you.

02:01.454 --> 02:04.123
          - So listen,
        I know I've been

02:04.125 --> 02:06.258
          Sending some
     mixed signals lately.

02:06.260 --> 02:09.360
           - Oh, no.
     No, it takes two to...

02:09.363 --> 02:11.530
       Mix signals, so...

02:11.532 --> 02:14.233
    - Those are gonna stop.

02:14.235 --> 02:15.801
            - Okay.
      - Decided I'm gonna

02:15.803 --> 02:19.371
   Give my relationship with
   wendy a real go, you know?

02:19.373 --> 02:21.440
           [exhales]

02:21.442 --> 02:23.609
   I just wanted to tell you.

02:24.911 --> 02:27.312
         - Yeah. Yeah.

02:27.314 --> 02:29.148
          Absolutely.
           Of course.

02:29.150 --> 02:31.416
  - I'm sorry about all this.
             - No.

02:33.153 --> 02:36.188
            - Okay.
            - Okay.

02:45.365 --> 02:47.799
           - Burgess.

02:47.801 --> 02:50.269
        Officer burgess.
            - Yeah?

02:52.205 --> 02:53.672
    - Go to the locker room,

02:53.674 --> 02:56.308
     Throw some cold water
         on your face,

02:56.310 --> 02:57.543
       Then tell yourself
          three times

02:57.545 --> 03:00.345
       He was never yours
         to begin with.

03:01.648 --> 03:03.415
              Go.

03:03.417 --> 03:05.384
            - Okay.

03:09.222 --> 03:11.456
       - Hi, I'm looking
       for erin lindsay.

03:11.458 --> 03:12.724
           - Are you?

03:12.726 --> 03:15.394
      - I'm an old friend.
       My name's charlie.

03:15.396 --> 03:16.895
   - You can leave your name
          and number.

03:16.897 --> 03:19.298
         I'll make sure
     she gets the message.

03:23.770 --> 03:26.371
         - Here you go.

03:26.373 --> 03:28.507
     - You got a last name,
            charlie,

03:28.509 --> 03:30.342
           Or is this
      a madonna-type deal?

03:33.313 --> 03:35.547
    - She'll know who I am.

03:35.549 --> 03:38.617
  Tell her it's been a while.

03:45.391 --> 03:47.593
- Hear anything more about pulpo
      getting pulled out?

03:47.595 --> 03:50.229
     - Apparently he's got
an unreasonable list of demands

03:50.231 --> 03:53.932
         - Yeah, well,
     he's safer in prison.

03:53.934 --> 03:54.933
             - Hey.

03:54.935 --> 03:57.436
   We got a rat in here, bro.

03:59.472 --> 04:02.241
           - [sighs]

04:03.276 --> 04:04.476
       What did you think
        was gonna happen

04:04.478 --> 04:05.811
    When you got this unit?

04:05.813 --> 04:07.846
  They'd just leave you alone;
       with your history?

04:07.848 --> 04:10.616
        - I didn't think
 they'd be so obvious about it.

04:10.618 --> 04:13.385
      [electronic beeping]

04:13.387 --> 04:14.519
         Go for voight.

04:14.521 --> 04:16.954
         - It's perry.
     Gustav munoz is back.

04:16.957 --> 04:19.024
  He struck again across town.

04:38.011 --> 04:39.478
       - This was munoz.

04:39.480 --> 04:43.448
  We got proof of it upstairs.

04:51.524 --> 04:54.526
     - Moving a lot of dope
          out of here.

05:00.767 --> 05:03.035
         - Hey, fellas.
    Found a misfired bullet.

05:03.037 --> 05:06.371
        Same as we found
 at the two-three stash house.

05:06.373 --> 05:07.506
      Crime lab did a rush
         on the prints.

05:07.508 --> 05:09.007
 It's a match for gustav munoz.

05:09.009 --> 05:10.842
- Where are we finding this guy?

05:10.844 --> 05:12.044
    - Well, we got his face
          everywhere.

05:12.046 --> 05:14.746
        Every department
      is looking for him.

05:14.748 --> 05:17.082
   - Look, I thought this guy
   was just a hired assassin.

05:17.084 --> 05:20.786
       Munoz is going for
     a full-on power grab.

05:20.788 --> 05:22.454
  He wants to wear that crown.

05:22.456 --> 05:25.390
 - I thought munoz was working
     for pulpo; yes or no?

05:25.392 --> 05:28.593
        Pulpo has agreed
  to cooperate with us fully.

05:28.595 --> 05:30.529
  We can ask him about munoz,

05:30.531 --> 05:32.864
      What his habits are,
what his behavior patterns are.

05:32.866 --> 05:35.400
- So why is he still in prison?

05:35.402 --> 05:36.735
 - Because he has a lot demands
      he keeps adding on--

05:36.737 --> 05:38.370
     - Look, make the deal!

05:40.773 --> 05:42.374
        Look around you!

05:42.376 --> 05:45.777
  We already waited too long.

05:45.779 --> 05:46.878
  Now anybody else still think

05:46.880 --> 05:48.480
        It's a bad idea
      to work with pulpo,

05:48.482 --> 05:51.550
  Raise your hand so I can see
   who to punch in the mouth.

05:51.552 --> 05:56.355
    - I think it's insanity.

05:56.357 --> 05:58.423
   - You run this operation.

05:58.425 --> 06:00.492
    You are gonna make sure
           that pulpo

06:00.494 --> 06:03.128
Gets in and out of prison safe,
      you understand that?

06:06.866 --> 06:08.600
  And you gonna keep your head
          on straight

06:08.602 --> 06:10.502
       Or you gonna take
      some vacation time.

06:10.504 --> 06:12.504
  Either way is fine with me.

06:27.954 --> 06:30.389
  - I know emotions are high.

06:30.391 --> 06:33.892
       Pulpo and his men
    cost us one of our own,

06:33.894 --> 06:36.962
         Nearly cost us
        a family member,

06:36.964 --> 06:38.463
      But if you got into
        this profession

06:38.465 --> 06:40.899
     Expecting not to deal
         with scumbags,

06:40.901 --> 06:43.702
          You got into
    the wrong line of work.

06:43.704 --> 06:46.405
           Go ahead.

06:46.407 --> 06:47.472
           Listen...

06:50.076 --> 06:54.413
   This is us doing our job.

07:18.538 --> 07:21.039
          - [exhales]

07:25.545 --> 07:27.112
            Antonio.

07:37.457 --> 07:37.689
               .

07:37.691 --> 07:39.958
           - Ah, yes.
         Gustav munoz.

07:39.960 --> 07:43.462
    "bad, bad, bad person."
              ha.

07:43.464 --> 07:45.730
         It'll be good
  to get him off the streets.

07:45.732 --> 07:46.731
         - Where is he?

07:46.733 --> 07:48.099
     - Ah, business first.

07:48.101 --> 07:50.202
      I need to make sure
        my deal is done.

07:50.204 --> 07:53.738
          After that,
      I'm at your service.

07:56.843 --> 07:59.511
        - I want to see
    what you're giving him.

07:59.513 --> 08:02.914
Money to his commissary account,
       extra yard time...

08:02.916 --> 08:04.516
       - It's all right.

08:10.656 --> 08:11.923
       - Conjugal visits?

08:11.925 --> 08:13.492
       Has he got a girl
          on the side?

08:13.494 --> 08:15.994
  We can use whatever leverage
          we can get.

08:15.996 --> 08:17.629
         - Yeah, okay.
      I know just the guy.

08:17.631 --> 08:18.897
         He's a hacker
      I busted a year ago.

08:18.899 --> 08:19.898
    He's under house arrest.

08:19.900 --> 08:21.500
           - Perfect.
              Go.

08:27.807 --> 08:29.674
             Munoz.

08:29.676 --> 08:33.278
       - As you may know,
     I'm still a criminal,

08:33.280 --> 08:35.280
        A shot caller--
             yes?--

08:35.282 --> 08:36.780
   To the eyes of the people
           in prison,

08:36.783 --> 08:38.750
     Which is why the idea
       of pulling me out

08:38.751 --> 08:41.152
       For a fake surgery
         was so smart.

08:41.154 --> 08:43.755
        Thanks for that,
       lieutenant belden.

08:43.756 --> 08:46.825
   How do you say in english
   what I'm getting removed?

08:46.827 --> 08:48.827
         - Gallbladder.
             - Ah!

08:48.829 --> 08:52.163
             Yes.
  <i> Vesicula biliar</i> in <i> espanol--</i>

08:52.165 --> 08:53.765
        - Hey! Hey! Hey!

08:55.601 --> 08:58.003
            - Munoz.

08:58.005 --> 09:00.071
           Right now.

09:00.073 --> 09:02.674
          - Of course.
             Um...

09:02.676 --> 09:05.644
  I'm gonna need a cell phone,
           <i> por favor.</i>

09:07.780 --> 09:09.814
       - Leave it alone.
        - I don't know.

09:09.816 --> 09:11.783
    Everyone in intelligence
         is gonna think

09:11.785 --> 09:14.653
 I'm some pie-eyed little girl
 who can't control her crushes.

09:14.655 --> 09:17.255
    - Naw. Ruzek was playing
    where he shouldn't have.

09:17.257 --> 09:19.791
     - It wasn't his fault.

09:19.793 --> 09:21.927
            - Sarge,
     can we get some keys?

09:25.097 --> 09:26.798
          - Let's go.

09:26.800 --> 09:28.733
        - Hey, lindsay.

09:28.735 --> 09:30.035
      Somebody stopped by
         for you today.

09:30.037 --> 09:32.704
            - Yeah?
  - Said his name was charlie.

09:32.706 --> 09:35.040
    Smelled like cigarettes
          and drakkar.

09:35.042 --> 09:38.877
        Said he knew you
     from a long time ago.

09:38.879 --> 09:40.779
         - You coming?

09:46.586 --> 09:49.821
       So who's charlie?

09:49.823 --> 09:52.657
     - He's a...He's a guy
      I used to run with.

        - Don't tell me
  we just got worked by pulpo.

22:24.476 --> 22:24.709
               .

22:24.711 --> 22:29.013
 - He was never gonna be there,
        and you know it.

22:29.015 --> 22:30.681
  You sent us on a goose chase

22:30.683 --> 22:33.984
 To take out your rival faction
       within the cartel.

22:33.986 --> 22:35.486
            - What?
      Nah, nah, nah, nah.

22:35.488 --> 22:37.521
           That is--
         that's crazy.

22:37.523 --> 22:41.425
        I thought munoz
 was gonna be there, I promise.

22:41.427 --> 22:43.494
          But even so,
     lieutenant belden here

22:43.496 --> 22:45.529
      Told me you removed
       at least 100 kilos

22:45.531 --> 22:48.532
  Of cocaine from the street,
   recovered illegal weapons,

22:48.534 --> 22:51.402
   And hundreds of thousands
   of dollars in drug money.

22:51.404 --> 22:55.573
      I mean, all in all,
    not a wasted trip, yes?

22:55.575 --> 22:58.943
     Which I believe, uh...

22:58.945 --> 23:01.912
   Is worth a new tv for me.

23:07.719 --> 23:10.020
    - Part of our side deal.
    Wasn't in the paperwork.

23:12.724 --> 23:14.425
           - Get out.

23:14.427 --> 23:17.795
           - Get out
 or I will throw your ass out.

23:17.797 --> 23:18.796
          - Hey, hey!

23:18.798 --> 23:20.531
     - Hey, guys, come on!

23:20.533 --> 23:22.633
      - Calm down, voight!
           Stop--hey!

23:22.635 --> 23:25.669
         Knock it off.

23:25.671 --> 23:28.172
           Let it go.

23:28.174 --> 23:31.041
          - Commander,
     let me run point now.

23:31.043 --> 23:33.511
 Pulpo doesn't trust these two
  as far as he can throw 'em.

23:33.513 --> 23:35.713
    - Commander, you wanted
       this lunatic out.

23:35.715 --> 23:38.015
          Here he is.

23:38.017 --> 23:43.621
  He will continue to play us
till he is hanging off a ledge.

23:43.623 --> 23:45.623
   Give me ten minutes alone
           with him.

23:45.625 --> 23:47.558
          Ten minutes.
      - You know I can't.

23:47.560 --> 23:49.627
           - Not now!

23:49.629 --> 23:50.694
      - We got something.

24:02.474 --> 24:05.543
   This is pulpo's baby mama
       and son, osberto.

24:05.545 --> 24:06.811
           - She here
  'cause she wants to be here?

24:06.813 --> 24:08.479
             - No.
       We leaned on her.

24:08.481 --> 24:10.514
      She's got a failure
      to appear off a dui.

24:10.516 --> 24:12.716
       - Maybe played up
      possible jail time.

24:14.686 --> 24:17.087
      - You watch the kid.

24:22.727 --> 24:24.562
     Can you come with me,
         please, ma'am?

24:33.638 --> 24:35.206
- Looks like it's just gonna be
           me and you

24:35.208 --> 24:37.475
   For a while, little buddy.

24:37.477 --> 24:38.976
    - Is my mom in trouble?

24:38.978 --> 24:41.645
           - [sighs]

24:41.647 --> 24:45.483
       There's a bad man,
  and we're trying to stop him

24:45.485 --> 24:47.518
  From doing more bad things,

24:47.520 --> 24:48.752
   And your mom's helping us.

24:48.754 --> 24:50.488
            - Okay.

24:50.490 --> 24:52.857
            - Okay?

24:52.859 --> 24:54.492
        It's all right.

24:54.494 --> 24:55.626
             Okay?

24:55.628 --> 24:56.694
              Oh.

25:03.068 --> 25:05.503
            - Adres?
    - Hey, it's okay, baby.

25:05.505 --> 25:07.671
  Everything's gonna be okay.

25:07.673 --> 25:08.772
   - Be a shame for your kid
           to grow up

25:08.774 --> 25:09.974
    With a mother in prison.

25:09.976 --> 25:11.609
     The system isn't good
         for any child.

25:11.611 --> 25:14.745
       - You took my son.
I have no problem taking yours.

25:14.747 --> 25:17.648
 - Adres, please don't let them
      take our baby away.

25:17.650 --> 25:18.849
       - Hey, it's okay.
              Hey.

25:18.851 --> 25:20.284
   Leave her and my son alone

25:20.286 --> 25:22.086
       And I'll tell you
      munoz's next target.

25:22.088 --> 25:23.521
            - Well,
  if your information's good,

25:23.523 --> 25:24.722
Maybe we can work something out,

25:24.724 --> 25:28.659
  But this is your last shot.

25:28.661 --> 25:31.262
        - I understand.
           - Mm-hmm.

25:31.264 --> 25:32.963
 - All I need before I tell you

25:32.965 --> 25:35.833
   Is to see my new deal that
  states that lina and my son

25:35.835 --> 25:37.067
Will be free from prosecution--

25:37.069 --> 25:40.037
   - Belden, I need to see it
          in writing!

25:40.039 --> 25:41.171
            Belden!

25:41.173 --> 25:42.907
              Hey!
           Hey, okay!

25:42.909 --> 25:44.808
             Okay!

25:44.810 --> 25:45.809
             Okay.

25:45.811 --> 25:48.245
         - Okay, what?
            - Munoz.

25:48.247 --> 25:51.248
        He's gonna be at
  the <i> festival de l'ascension.</i>

25:51.250 --> 25:53.584
      You've heard of it,
        right, antonio?

25:53.586 --> 25:54.852
 - It's at the aragon ballroom.

25:54.854 --> 25:55.853
      It starts tomorrow.

25:55.855 --> 25:58.689
        - That's right.

26:01.593 --> 26:04.094
        There's this man
         from new york.

26:04.096 --> 26:06.130
     He's a high-level man.

26:06.132 --> 26:08.332
 His name is francisco heredia.

26:08.334 --> 26:10.200
      Munoz knows he'll be
        at the festival,

26:10.202 --> 26:12.736
    And munoz will be there
          to kill him.

26:12.738 --> 26:19.109
    This is the final piece
 of the <i> rompecabezas</i> for munoz.

26:19.111 --> 26:21.946
  - It's a bitch getting into
     the foster care system

26:21.948 --> 26:23.847
       At five years old.

26:23.849 --> 26:26.817
       I've investigated
     a lot of these cases.

26:26.819 --> 26:28.652
         The thing is,
you just never know what happens

26:28.654 --> 26:30.588
     To some of these kids
       until years later.

26:30.590 --> 26:32.356
        - I promise you
       this is the truth.

26:32.358 --> 26:36.627
   - How do you know for sure
     heredia will be there?

26:36.629 --> 26:40.097
      - It's the birthday
       of his twin girls.

26:40.099 --> 26:42.132
      They were born here,
  and he's very superstitious.

26:42.134 --> 26:46.036
    Every year he, his wife,
       and his twin girls

26:46.038 --> 26:47.638
        Go to first day
        of the festival.

26:49.674 --> 26:51.141
      Once heredia dies...

26:51.143 --> 26:52.810
           [whistles]

26:52.812 --> 26:58.649
  Munoz and his men will have
 sole control over the cartel.

26:58.651 --> 27:01.352
   - Tell everyone to be here
          at 8:00 a.M.

27:01.354 --> 27:06.056
           - Voight,
   I want to see my son now.

27:06.058 --> 27:07.091
             - No.

27:07.093 --> 27:09.093
           - Please!
            Belden!

27:09.095 --> 27:11.261
       - We catch munoz,
     you can see your son.

27:15.400 --> 27:17.034
       You have my word.

27:26.811 --> 27:28.746
          - 8:00 a.M.
 Be suited up and ready to go.

27:28.748 --> 27:31.382
    - And we believe pulpo?
 - What is it jay likes to say?

27:31.384 --> 27:33.183
         He's the best
    of a lot of bad options.

27:33.185 --> 27:34.685
    - So we're just supposed
    to take his word for it

27:34.687 --> 27:36.387
      Even after he lied--

27:36.389 --> 27:38.389
          [bangs desk]
    - you think I want to be

27:38.391 --> 27:40.224
    Dealing with this prick?

27:40.226 --> 27:41.792
           Every day
     I look across the desk

27:41.794 --> 27:44.428
       And I see a chair
 where my partner used to sit,

27:44.430 --> 27:46.664
       And she ain't here
        because of him.

27:55.874 --> 27:59.176
      [cell phone buzzing]

28:12.123 --> 28:14.391
          - Hey, baby.
              Hey.

28:14.393 --> 28:17.227
         What's wrong?
       - [sniffles] um...

28:17.229 --> 28:19.229
          - Come here.
            In here.

28:19.231 --> 28:21.231
       - I've been trying
          to call you.

28:21.233 --> 28:22.399
       - Yeah, I'm sorry.

28:22.401 --> 28:24.168
       I've been swamped
        with this case.

28:24.170 --> 28:28.439
    - I think I'm gonna stay
with my folks for a little bit.

28:28.441 --> 28:30.407
           [sniffles]

28:36.448 --> 28:38.716
       - What's going on?
  - Adam, this isn't the place

28:38.718 --> 28:40.417
   To have this conversation,
        but I never know

28:40.419 --> 28:42.019
    When I'm gonna see you.

28:44.189 --> 28:48.726
  You're not the same as when
   you went into the academy,

28:48.728 --> 28:51.428
 And something about this unit
        has changed you.

29:30.902 --> 29:31.135
               .

29:31.137 --> 29:32.436
        - Atwater, hey.

29:32.438 --> 29:34.938
       You seen burgess?

29:34.940 --> 29:36.073
             - Why?

29:36.075 --> 29:37.307
   - What do you mean "why"?

29:37.309 --> 29:39.009
    - Just leave her alone,
              man.

29:39.011 --> 29:41.945
     - Listen, I don't care
    that you work upstairs.

29:41.947 --> 29:43.180
          I don't care
      that you outrank me.

29:43.182 --> 29:46.150
   You messing with her head
           too much.

29:46.152 --> 29:47.317
 So either you leave her alone,

29:47.319 --> 29:49.920
      Or me and you gonna
      have to get into it.

29:54.559 --> 29:55.926
       - All right, man,
          you got it.

30:01.432 --> 30:04.201
         - Fair enough.

30:05.837 --> 30:07.404
        - Oh, thank you.

30:09.040 --> 30:10.941
            - Erin.

30:10.943 --> 30:13.010
           - Charlie.

30:13.012 --> 30:14.578
          - I'm back.

30:17.015 --> 30:19.449
            - Uh...

30:19.451 --> 30:20.884
          I'll, uh...

30:20.886 --> 30:23.587
     I'll see you tomorrow.

30:23.589 --> 30:25.389
          - You sure?

30:25.391 --> 30:27.090
            - Yeah.

30:27.092 --> 30:28.091
            - Okay.

30:28.093 --> 30:29.293
          - I'm good.

30:34.599 --> 30:35.999
           - No hug?

30:36.001 --> 30:39.002
            Come on.
            Come on.

30:40.405 --> 30:42.039
           All right.

30:42.041 --> 30:45.008
    I'm not gonna believe it
     till I see the badge.

30:45.010 --> 30:47.344
            Come on.

30:48.279 --> 30:51.181
   I still don't believe it.

30:52.851 --> 30:55.953
          - It's funny
    how life works out, huh?

30:55.955 --> 30:57.588
      You're not supposed
   to be in chicago, charlie.

30:57.590 --> 30:59.857
    - It's been long enough.

30:59.859 --> 31:02.025
      I missed everybody,

31:02.027 --> 31:04.294
          Missed you,

31:04.296 --> 31:05.462
           And, uh...

31:07.265 --> 31:11.168
       Well, I don't need
       to explain myself.

31:11.170 --> 31:14.071
     I wanted to come back.

31:14.073 --> 31:17.107
       You still in touch
          with annie?

31:17.109 --> 31:18.976
         - Yeah, I am.

31:18.978 --> 31:20.210
            - Yeah,
  I been looking for her too.

31:20.212 --> 31:23.113
      You got her number?

31:23.115 --> 31:25.249
      - You got to let me
       talk to her first.

31:25.251 --> 31:27.084
   - You gonna be like that?
            Come on.

31:27.086 --> 31:28.085
        Give me a break.

31:28.087 --> 31:30.320
     - I have your number,
            charlie.

31:30.322 --> 31:32.956
       I'll be in touch.

31:43.101 --> 31:45.235
   - I'm proud of you, girl.

31:45.237 --> 31:47.037
          I'm serious.

31:47.039 --> 31:48.605
        You made it out.

31:51.342 --> 31:53.076
           - Thanks.

31:55.079 --> 31:57.180
         - You're safe.

31:59.617 --> 32:01.485
        [knock on door]

32:08.359 --> 32:09.526
             - Hey.

32:11.162 --> 32:12.162
             - Hey.

32:12.164 --> 32:14.564
         - How's work?

32:14.566 --> 32:17.200
            - Great.
    Voight thinks I'm a rat.

32:17.202 --> 32:18.335
      Couldn't be better.

32:18.337 --> 32:19.937
      - Just prove to him
        that you're not.

32:19.939 --> 32:21.238
          - [chuckles]

32:21.240 --> 32:24.107
       I've been trying.

32:35.987 --> 32:37.521
    - I have a couple hours.

32:39.624 --> 32:41.024
    - We talked about this.

32:41.026 --> 32:43.093
 - I'm looking for my own place
           right now.

32:43.095 --> 32:45.162
            I swear.

32:45.164 --> 32:47.664
        And we're gonna
      tell the kids soon.

32:47.666 --> 32:49.566
         - Okay, well,
      when that happens--

32:49.568 --> 32:52.402
             - Mia,
    we're gonna be together.

32:52.404 --> 32:53.737
     You must believe that.

32:53.739 --> 32:56.273
    - Don't do this for me,
            please,

32:56.275 --> 32:59.142
 Because she is gonna take you
 for everything that you have.

32:59.144 --> 33:00.610
 - I've got it all worked out.

33:04.248 --> 33:06.550
   - Let me know when you do.

33:11.356 --> 33:13.256
            - Okay.

33:37.582 --> 33:38.715
    - I've figured out a way

33:38.717 --> 33:42.352
   To make you worth my time
          and effort.

33:42.354 --> 33:45.655
     - Well, that's great.

33:45.657 --> 33:48.425
            - 25%...

33:48.427 --> 33:52.029
    Everything that you take
        off the street.

33:52.031 --> 33:55.532
  - Well, it doesn't look like
 I have much of a choice, so...

33:55.534 --> 33:56.800
           All right.

33:56.802 --> 33:58.802
    - If you try to screw me

33:58.804 --> 34:00.337
       Or shortchange me
         or set me up,

34:00.339 --> 34:01.671
  I have five bear traps set,

34:01.673 --> 34:02.806
        And you will not
       make it out alive.

34:02.808 --> 34:04.608
          - I get it.

34:20.824 --> 34:22.559
      - Francisco heredia.

34:22.561 --> 34:23.693
    Get a good look at him.

34:23.695 --> 34:25.128
        Now we obviously
        want munoz first

34:25.130 --> 34:27.297
  Before any shots are fired.

34:27.299 --> 34:29.599
   Getting heredia in custody
   is a secondary objective.

34:29.601 --> 34:31.601
   It's gonna be a big crowd,
     lots of moving parts,

34:31.603 --> 34:33.303
So keep your eyes and ears open.

34:33.304 --> 34:34.304
          - All right.

34:34.306 --> 34:35.839
      Hey, jin, come here.

34:42.179 --> 34:43.179
             - Hey.

34:45.550 --> 34:48.150
 I was out of line last night.

34:48.152 --> 34:50.187
    - No, you weren't, man.

34:50.188 --> 34:52.188
           Come here.

34:54.225 --> 34:56.193
          I love you.

34:58.831 --> 35:01.231
       You got to tell me
       you love me back,

35:01.233 --> 35:03.333
           Otherwise
     I look like an idiot.

35:03.335 --> 35:04.668
         Come on, man.

35:04.670 --> 35:08.138
    - I love you too, alvin.

35:08.140 --> 35:09.639
           All right?
        - Yeah. Thanks.

35:09.641 --> 35:10.874
        - Is that good?

35:13.312 --> 35:17.180
         - We got I.A.
  Sniffing around here lately.

35:17.182 --> 35:20.417
   I want you to keep an eye
       on sumner for me.

35:20.419 --> 35:22.752
  You get anything that shows
     that she's a pipeline,

35:22.754 --> 35:26.156
     I want to hear about.

35:26.158 --> 35:27.691
         - You got it.

35:27.693 --> 35:28.892
          - That's it.

35:31.362 --> 35:35.232
  [background noise, chatter]

35:41.572 --> 35:43.440
          [bell dings]

35:43.442 --> 35:45.609
         [bell ringing]

36:04.929 --> 36:06.530
    - Heredia just arrived.

36:38.563 --> 36:39.829
        - Keep your eye
    on the florist on stage

36:39.831 --> 36:41.865
        Near the statue.

36:45.903 --> 36:47.304
              Gun.

36:47.306 --> 36:48.605
           [gunshots]

36:48.607 --> 36:50.907
          Shots fired!
          Shots fired!

36:50.909 --> 36:53.977
       [woman screaming]

36:55.813 --> 36:58.949
       - There is no way
    that he got both guards!

36:58.951 --> 37:00.917
           Any visual
  on the second muzzle flash?

37:00.919 --> 37:02.519
       - Alvin, halstead,
       you got this guy?

37:02.521 --> 37:04.221
     - Target ducked down.
       He's out of sight.

37:04.223 --> 37:05.855
      - Can't get a lock.
         No clear shot.

37:12.430 --> 37:12.662
               .

37:12.664 --> 37:15.599
          [screaming]

37:17.802 --> 37:18.868
             - Aah!

37:18.870 --> 37:20.837
           - Come on.
    Come over here. Come on.

37:20.839 --> 37:22.472
           Stay down!

37:22.474 --> 37:24.507
          - Get down.

37:24.509 --> 37:25.842
          Find munoz!

37:29.614 --> 37:31.414
    - I have eyes on munoz!

37:35.586 --> 37:37.621
   - Move, move, move, move!

37:47.532 --> 37:50.634
          - Negative.
He's blocked from this position.

38:04.315 --> 38:05.582
           - Come on.

38:07.051 --> 38:09.486
            Come on.

38:09.488 --> 38:10.620
         I have munoz.

38:10.622 --> 38:11.888
            - Fire.

38:13.591 --> 38:15.959

    - You got it, commander.

38:26.505 --> 38:28.872
  Well, I will pass it along.

38:28.874 --> 38:30.473
   That was commander perry.

38:30.475 --> 38:32.809
      He wants to know why
     shots had to be fired.

38:32.811 --> 38:35.312
   - So much for "nice job."

38:35.314 --> 38:36.446
   - The day perry says that,

38:36.448 --> 38:38.448
    I will take everyone out
          for karaoke.

38:38.450 --> 38:40.383
             - Ha.
      I'd pay to see that.

38:40.385 --> 38:42.585
   - What are you gonna sing,
             boss?

           -<i> My way.</i>

38:45.856 --> 38:47.457
- You were expecting <i> love shack?</i>

        - I don't know.
           - [laughs]

38:52.396 --> 38:53.430

         <i> ¿si,</i> antonio?

38:56.567 --> 38:58.635
   - I want him out of here.

38:58.637 --> 39:00.603
     - Hey, we had a deal!

39:00.605 --> 39:04.507
 I get to hold lina and my son
          before I go.

39:04.509 --> 39:06.710
   - Get him out of here now.

        - I made a deal.
        I keep my word.

39:28.934 --> 39:30.700
    Or voight's gonna wonder
          where I am.

   I need you to stay on top
    of voight's phone calls,

  His emails, his whereabouts,
          everything.

39:39.077 --> 39:40.643
  I want a full work-up on him

39:40.645 --> 39:42.579
         To be conveyed
   in a comprehensive report

       Is there, antonio?

40:30.595 --> 40:34.531

       You see anything?

41:33.692 --> 41:35.592
         - No. Nothing.
        - I'll go left.
