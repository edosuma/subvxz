00:03.242 --> 00:04.935
Hey, Kennedy! What's up?

00:04.936 --> 00:06.709
What's up? What's up?

00:06.710 --> 00:11.216
I'll tell you what's up. Unemployment,
ocean levels, the national debt!

00:11.217 --> 00:15.237
And me, I'm up! Fed up with you!

00:17.891 --> 00:20.793
- Well, that was weird.
- No kidding.

00:20.794 --> 00:25.324
Unemployment is actually down
a tenth of a point this week.

00:25.325 --> 00:27.167
She seems really mean,

00:27.168 --> 00:30.543
which is odd because Fletcher
has been dating her for weeks now.

00:30.544 --> 00:33.038
And he seems completely devoted to her.

00:33.039 --> 00:36.339
More garbage, my darling?

00:41.042 --> 00:43.706
What are you doing?

00:43.707 --> 00:46.124
You're completely humiliating yourself.

00:46.125 --> 00:47.886
I have a good reason.

00:47.887 --> 00:48.987
Not you.

00:48.988 --> 00:52.468
I was talking to the goat.

00:53.246 --> 00:55.544
I'm trying to break up with Kennedy.

00:55.545 --> 00:58.797
So you can date the goat?

00:58.798 --> 00:59.865
No.

00:59.866 --> 01:01.923
Every time I try to end
things with Kennedy, I get

01:01.924 --> 01:05.229
confused when she uses all
her fancy debate terms like...

01:05.230 --> 01:09.392
"Burden of proof" and
"shut it, I'm talking".

01:09.393 --> 01:12.845
So I'm trying to create a scandal that
will threaten her political future.

01:12.846 --> 01:15.681
When she sees this, she'll have
no choice but to break up with me.

01:15.682 --> 01:17.983
[Elevator bell dings]

01:17.984 --> 01:19.952
- Fletcher!
- Kennedy!

01:19.953 --> 01:22.988
It's not what it looks like! [Bleats]

01:22.989 --> 01:25.958
Well, what it looks like to me
is that you're an animal lover.

01:25.959 --> 01:27.793
Oh, no. [Bleats]

01:27.794 --> 01:29.995
My secret is out.

01:29.996 --> 01:31.830
And I'm glad it is.

01:31.831 --> 01:33.211
Huh?

01:33.212 --> 01:37.936
The latest polls have shown that Americans
prefer animals to humans by a wide margin.

01:37.937 --> 01:40.516
This will give a huge
boost to my campaign.

01:40.517 --> 01:44.694
Let me get a picture of
you and the goat. [Bleats]

01:44.695 --> 01:46.795
Kissing.

01:47.109 --> 01:49.047
Excuse me?

01:49.048 --> 01:50.347
Kiss the goat!

01:50.348 --> 01:53.148
Not for me, but for our fellow citizens!

01:53.149 --> 01:57.367
Let the people of this great nation
see how much you love animals!

01:57.368 --> 02:02.708
Oh, yeah! As a future
voter, I'd like to see that.

03:06.800 --> 03:10.115
Rumor has it you totally
bombed your math test.

03:10.116 --> 03:12.084
I did. Look at this!

03:12.085 --> 03:16.467
A 93! That's the lowest A you can get!

03:16.468 --> 03:18.385
My future is over!

03:18.386 --> 03:22.698
Now, I'll have to go to some
clown college. Like Cornell!

03:22.699 --> 03:25.953
Well, you're dressed for clown college.

03:25.954 --> 03:28.425
I don't understand how this happened.

03:28.426 --> 03:32.629
My eidetic memory has always
made taking tests easy as pie.

03:32.630 --> 03:36.205
An expression I never understood,
because making a pie is not easy.

03:36.206 --> 03:40.370
Especially the crust.
The crust is everything.

03:40.371 --> 03:42.539
Math isn't about rote memorization.

03:42.540 --> 03:44.341
It's about problem solving.

03:44.342 --> 03:46.124
Something you clearly haven't mastered

03:46.125 --> 03:49.446
or you would have solved the problem
of your irritating personality.

03:49.447 --> 03:51.547
I know!

03:52.483 --> 03:56.386
And the worst part is, the
teacher said I need to get a tutor.

03:56.387 --> 04:01.258
Wow. I pity the poor soul who
gets stuck having to tutor you.

04:01.259 --> 04:04.019
What a nightmare.

04:05.363 --> 04:08.363
It's me, isn't it?

04:12.570 --> 04:16.410
There's Kennedy. She's so mean.

04:16.507 --> 04:18.031
What are you doing?

04:18.033 --> 04:21.079
I don't want her to notice
me, so I'm trying to blend in.

04:21.079 --> 04:24.735
I'm pretending to be a coffee table.

04:24.736 --> 04:29.352
But you don't look anything
like a coffee table.

04:29.353 --> 04:32.259
Hey! Use a coaster!

04:32.260 --> 04:35.190
Hey, Olive. I love your hair today.

04:35.191 --> 04:37.150
It reminds me of amber waves of grain,

04:37.151 --> 04:40.497
a staple of our great
nation's farming industry.

04:40.498 --> 04:43.667
Also, we have a coffee table at
home that looks just like this.

04:43.668 --> 04:45.335
Thank you!

04:45.336 --> 04:46.764
I mean...

04:46.765 --> 04:49.165
Table sound.

04:49.827 --> 04:54.344
Well, if you like her hair, what do
you think about my new purple outfit?

04:54.345 --> 04:57.347
Doesn't it just scream
"purple mountain majesties?"

04:57.348 --> 04:58.515
Really, Chyna?

04:58.516 --> 05:00.317
Purple is the color of royalty.

05:00.318 --> 05:02.427
You might as well just
slap a crown on your head

05:02.428 --> 05:07.408
and pretend the Revolutionary
War never happened!

05:07.525 --> 05:10.812
You were right. She is so nice.

05:10.813 --> 05:12.894
She just hates you.

05:12.895 --> 05:14.895
But she can't hate me.

05:14.896 --> 05:18.510
Kennedy and Fletcher are a couple
now, and if she doesn't like me, then,

05:18.511 --> 05:20.740
we'll never get to hang out with him.

05:20.741 --> 05:23.673
Perfect! He'll be out
of our lives forever!

05:23.674 --> 05:28.918
And isn't his birthday coming up? Now
we won't have to get him a present!

05:28.919 --> 05:31.348
I don't want him out of our lives.

05:31.349 --> 05:33.980
I need to do something about this.

05:33.981 --> 05:36.956
Oh, I know what this is about.

05:36.957 --> 05:39.422
You just can't deal with
people not liking you.

05:39.423 --> 05:41.944
That is so not true.

05:41.945 --> 05:46.346
And what do you mean "people" not
liking me, who else doesn't like me?

05:46.347 --> 05:48.999
Let's not focus on the dozens
of people who don't like you.

05:49.000 --> 05:51.893
Let's just focus on the reason why
Kennedy can't stand the sight of you.

05:51.894 --> 05:53.447
You know what?

05:53.448 --> 05:56.363
I'm just going to talk to Kennedy
and get to the bottom of this.

05:56.364 --> 06:00.084
I mean, she seems approachable.

06:00.602 --> 06:03.738
- Hey, Kennedy...
- Security breach!

06:03.739 --> 06:06.233
Wait! I just have one
question. [Elevator bell dings]

06:06.234 --> 06:09.534
You guys like me, right?

06:11.847 --> 06:13.748
Lexi, thank you for tutoring me.

06:13.749 --> 06:16.717
Well, my friends rate is $20 an hour.

06:16.718 --> 06:19.418
So for you, 30.

06:20.856 --> 06:24.390
Okay, let's start off with
some polynomial functions.

06:24.391 --> 06:29.664
When solving for x, the first step is
to find the degree of the polynomial.

06:29.665 --> 06:31.232
Okay. So...

06:31.233 --> 06:35.613
Two x-squared plus three x minus two...

06:36.705 --> 06:38.515
Why are you sweeping?

06:38.516 --> 06:41.843
Oh, I think better when
I clean. Don't mind me.

06:41.844 --> 06:43.764
Legs!

06:46.217 --> 06:50.657
So whenever we study, you have to clean?

06:50.686 --> 06:53.317
No. I don't have to clean.

06:53.318 --> 06:55.117
I want to clean.

06:55.118 --> 06:57.792
I'm not some freak.

06:57.793 --> 07:00.836
Two x-squared plus three x minus two...

07:00.837 --> 07:02.239
You know what?

07:02.240 --> 07:05.043
I think, we need to find
a better place to study.

07:05.044 --> 07:07.204
My room!

07:08.076 --> 07:11.465
And why is this better
than studying in my room?

07:11.466 --> 07:16.611
Because studies show that people learn
better by changing their environments.

07:16.612 --> 07:19.714
- Oh, I read that study.
- You did?

07:19.715 --> 07:22.668
Yeah. Cognitive psychologists
have found that when you study

07:22.669 --> 07:26.372
you can improve your comprehension and
retention by altering your locations.

07:26.373 --> 07:27.917
Although, if that were true,

07:27.918 --> 07:31.304
wouldn't flight attendants be
the smartest people in the world?

07:31.305 --> 07:34.050
Free vacations and dates
with pilots? [Chuckles]

07:34.051 --> 07:36.223
Aren't they?

07:36.224 --> 07:39.634
Anyway, I've provided you with
some sample trigonometry problems.

07:39.635 --> 07:45.535
I've also provided you with hampers for
whites, lights, darks and hand-wash only.

07:50.406 --> 07:52.459
Lexi, I don't know what to do.

07:52.460 --> 07:56.584
I want to ask Kennedy what her problem
is with me, but she won't even talk to me.

07:56.585 --> 07:59.620
Can you believe that?

07:59.621 --> 08:01.789
No one's ever treated
me that way before.

08:01.790 --> 08:05.570
It's like I don't even exist.

08:06.033 --> 08:09.067
Well, maybe she just has
nothing nice to say to me,

08:09.068 --> 08:13.568
so she'd rather not say anything at all.

08:14.803 --> 08:18.739
Well, whatever the reason,
I need to fix the situation.

08:18.740 --> 08:20.097
But how?

08:20.098 --> 08:22.422
I can't even get close to her
because she's hired her own,

08:22.423 --> 08:26.847
Secret Service guys to make
her look more presidential.

08:26.848 --> 08:28.783
That's it.

08:28.784 --> 08:32.083
Great idea! Thanks, Lexi!

08:40.596 --> 08:43.831
[Gruffly] It's time
for your break, Mark.

08:43.832 --> 08:45.700
I mean Dan.

08:45.701 --> 08:47.006
Steve?

08:47.007 --> 08:48.235
Jeff?

08:48.236 --> 08:50.096
Tim?

08:53.193 --> 08:57.473
Ms. Van Buren, I need to warn
you about a potential threat.

08:57.474 --> 09:02.750
We've intercepted chatter that people have
been impersonating Secret Service agents.

09:02.751 --> 09:05.092
Is there anyone you know
who doesn't like you?

09:05.093 --> 09:07.588
Or more importantly,
anyone you don't like?

09:07.589 --> 09:10.157
And if so, why? Let's go alphabetically.

09:10.158 --> 09:13.761
Starting with the letter C-H.

09:13.762 --> 09:16.764
- Before we do that, I have one request.
- Name it.

09:16.765 --> 09:20.386
Stop trying to steal
my boyfriend, Chyna!

09:20.387 --> 09:23.504
Kennedy, wait! [Elevator bell dings]

09:23.505 --> 09:25.305
Oh!

09:25.994 --> 09:28.776
It's time for your break, Vic.

09:28.777 --> 09:30.645
I mean Frank.

09:30.646 --> 09:31.886
Elliot?

09:31.887 --> 09:32.958
Patrick?

09:32.959 --> 09:35.059
Vincent?

09:42.554 --> 09:46.950
Kennedy! Do you seriously think
I'm trying to steal your boyfriend?

09:46.951 --> 09:50.954
Yes. Like all girls, you
find Fletcher irresistible.

09:50.955 --> 09:52.402
Fletcher?

09:52.403 --> 09:54.099
Did you break up with
the Fletcher I know

09:54.100 --> 09:57.414
and start dating some
gorgeous model named Fletcher?

09:57.415 --> 10:00.358
Stop pretending like
you're not interested.

10:00.359 --> 10:02.508
Kennedy, I'm not.

10:02.509 --> 10:06.596
I am actually thrilled that he's
found someone and that he's so in love.

10:06.597 --> 10:08.157
He said that?

10:08.158 --> 10:10.352
He said he's in love?

10:10.353 --> 10:14.155
Well, we haven't actually
discussed it, but I can tell.

10:14.156 --> 10:16.702
He even has a picture
of you next to his bed.

10:16.703 --> 10:18.434
Fletcher: Take this, Kennedy!

10:18.435 --> 10:20.535
[Grunts]

10:21.018 --> 10:23.118
[Grunts]

10:29.927 --> 10:34.667
In fact, I bet he's
missing you right now.

10:37.306 --> 10:39.266
Chyna, I really
appreciate you helping me

10:39.267 --> 10:41.387
figure out what to get
Fletcher for his birthday.

10:41.388 --> 10:45.283
What can I say? I'm a
likeable friend. Who you like.

10:45.284 --> 10:48.104
Am I right, guys?

10:48.793 --> 10:51.540
Anyway, I'm thinking of
getting Fletcher a lunch with

10:51.541 --> 10:56.079
former Deputy Secretary
of Defense, Paul Wolfowitz.

10:56.080 --> 11:01.540
I think his Grandma Dottie
got him that for Christmas.

11:01.686 --> 11:03.686
But you know what he'd really love?

11:03.687 --> 11:05.506
If you threw him a surprise party.

11:05.507 --> 11:08.352
You can get all his friends to come.

11:08.353 --> 11:12.295
Plus some other random people so
the room doesn't seem so empty.

11:12.296 --> 11:16.024
Great! We'll have lots of
red, white, and blue streamers.

11:16.025 --> 11:19.025
Actually, Fletcher is
afraid of streamers.

11:19.026 --> 11:20.886
Why?

11:21.082 --> 11:25.462
Hey, look at me! I'm a streamer mummy.

11:25.627 --> 11:27.644
Pinata time!

11:27.645 --> 11:29.925
[Screaming]

11:34.384 --> 11:38.116
Fine, but we can have tons of balloons!

11:38.117 --> 11:41.524
Actually, Fletcher
is afraid of balloons.

11:41.525 --> 11:44.326
Why would he be afraid of balloons?

11:44.327 --> 11:48.767
Behold the wonders
of static electricity.

11:57.307 --> 11:58.607
Fine.

11:58.608 --> 12:01.143
You take him out to dinner
while we set everything up.

12:01.144 --> 12:04.313
Then I'll send a text to Fletcher and
tell him to meet me in the boys' lounge.

12:04.314 --> 12:08.450
Then, when he walks in, everybody
will jump up and yell, "surprise!"

12:08.451 --> 12:11.801
Actually, Fletcher's afraid
of the word "surprise".

12:11.802 --> 12:13.662
Why?

12:14.357 --> 12:16.258
Surprise!

12:16.259 --> 12:18.211
Is that supposed to scare me?

12:18.212 --> 12:22.052
Ooh, I'm startled! [Duck quacks]

12:23.433 --> 12:27.360
Did I say "surprise"? I meant "duck".

12:27.361 --> 12:31.073
I think it might be safer if we said
something else that meant surprise.

12:31.074 --> 12:36.974
How about everyone jumps out and yells,
"unforeseen circumstance!" [Laughs]

12:43.721 --> 12:46.288
A 95. That's good.

12:46.289 --> 12:49.769
That's five less than 100.

12:50.460 --> 12:53.832
I just needed a little
help in math, I'm not five.

12:53.833 --> 12:56.533
Five! Very good!

12:56.915 --> 13:00.455
One, two, three, four, five.

13:01.826 --> 13:03.880
Since you need a little bit more help,

13:03.881 --> 13:06.643
we're going to study
in Angus's room today.

13:06.644 --> 13:12.164
That makes sense. But do I
really need this math cart?

13:12.382 --> 13:13.744
Yes.

13:13.745 --> 13:16.938
Where else are you going
to keep your graph paper?

13:16.939 --> 13:20.059
And your toilet paper?

13:20.257 --> 13:21.557
Now let's get cracking.

13:21.558 --> 13:24.560
I have a whole list of other
places we need to study later.

13:24.561 --> 13:26.777
For instance, at 3:30...

13:26.778 --> 13:32.178
We're studying at a six
bedroom house in Santa Cruz.

13:35.237 --> 13:37.397
Tutoring.

13:38.767 --> 13:40.927
Tutoring.

13:52.102 --> 13:54.757
Hey, we said $20.

13:54.758 --> 14:00.658
I'm only paying half because I thought she
was going to be in a cute maid's outfit.

14:04.161 --> 14:05.301
[Bleats]

14:05.302 --> 14:08.992
The trash you don't eat
still needs to be thrown away.

14:08.993 --> 14:12.703
What were you, raised in a barn?

14:12.704 --> 14:17.880
Dude, as much as I enjoy watching
you and your goat wife bicker...

14:17.881 --> 14:22.053
I have it on good authority that
Kennedy and Chyna have become friends.

14:22.054 --> 14:23.905
That's very good for you.

14:23.906 --> 14:27.707
The girlfriend I can't stand is now
friends with the girlfriend I can't get?

14:27.708 --> 14:29.009
How is that good?

14:29.010 --> 14:32.174
Kennedy will talk to Chyna
about what a great guy you are.

14:32.175 --> 14:34.748
And Chyna will realize
what she's missing out on.

14:34.749 --> 14:36.783
Then, she'll ask you out.

14:36.784 --> 14:38.785
You really think so?

14:38.786 --> 14:43.255
Isn't that what happens
in every Shakespeare play?

14:43.256 --> 14:48.836
I'm asking because I don't
know. I have a report due.

14:49.275 --> 14:51.601
Hey, Fletcher. Since
tomorrow is your birthday

14:51.602 --> 14:54.072
I was hoping I could do
something special for you.

14:54.073 --> 14:56.900
Can I take you out to dinner?

14:56.901 --> 14:58.302
[Chuckles nervously]

14:58.303 --> 15:03.281
Perfect. Then let's meet
here tomorrow at 6:00.

15:03.282 --> 15:04.744
You were right.

15:04.745 --> 15:06.713
Chyna is totally into me!

15:06.714 --> 15:09.907
This is going to be
the best birthday ever!

15:09.908 --> 15:12.008
[Bleats]

15:12.720 --> 15:14.147
"Meh"?

15:14.148 --> 15:20.048
Really? Everything's "meh" with
you. I'm tired of your negativity.

15:24.136 --> 15:27.531
I didn't know they
even sold math smocks.

15:27.532 --> 15:32.392
The calculator apron is
convenient and stylish.

15:33.129 --> 15:36.611
But do we really need to have our
tutoring session in this hotel?

15:36.612 --> 15:40.323
Yes. [Chuckles] What
better place to study math?

15:40.324 --> 15:46.224
I read that Pythagoras came up with his
theorem at a Snuggle Time Comfort Lodge.

15:46.684 --> 15:50.869
Anyway, I'll be back in two
hours to check in on your work.

15:50.870 --> 15:54.840
You focus on quadratic
equations. In every room.

15:54.841 --> 15:58.677
Except for the ones that
say "do not disturb".

15:58.678 --> 16:02.548
Somebody else is
studying in those rooms.

16:02.549 --> 16:05.563
So if A-squared equals
B-squared plus C-squared

16:05.564 --> 16:09.494
minus two B-C cosine A,
then B-squared equals...

16:09.495 --> 16:12.195
Mother of pearl!

16:12.559 --> 16:16.090
Where did all this hair come from?

16:16.091 --> 16:18.928
Hey! What do you think you're doing?

16:18.929 --> 16:20.946
Principal Skidmore?

16:20.947 --> 16:24.307
Student I barely remember?

16:26.369 --> 16:27.943
What are you doing here?

16:27.944 --> 16:30.469
And why do you have a math smock?

16:30.470 --> 16:32.612
I'm not Principal Skidmore anymore.

16:32.613 --> 16:36.048
Because you Ants left
Webster, I lost my job.

16:36.049 --> 16:39.818
Well, that and because I drove my
car through the wall of the school.

16:39.819 --> 16:41.487
Sorry to hear that.

16:41.488 --> 16:44.130
Are you kidding? Best thing
that ever happened to me.

16:44.131 --> 16:48.494
I get a lot more respect as a maid than
I ever did as a high school Principal.

16:48.495 --> 16:53.085
But now I've lost my job again thanks
to you and your cut-rate maid services!

16:53.086 --> 16:55.669
There must be some
misunderstanding. I'm not a maid.

16:55.670 --> 16:58.750
Lexi's just my math tutor and she
thought it would be good if I studied here

16:58.751 --> 17:01.275
with my math cart,
wearing my math smock, and,

17:01.276 --> 17:05.344
for some reason she told me to put
little mints on the pillows once I was...

17:05.345 --> 17:08.885
What the heck? I'm a maid!

17:09.223 --> 17:10.944
Not on my turf, you're not!

17:10.944 --> 17:16.845
Hey! Easy with my geometry wand!
I need that to draw circles!

17:22.462 --> 17:26.598
Thanks for dinner. I always like
to try new, unusual ethnic foods.

17:26.599 --> 17:29.702
You had spaghetti with butter.

17:29.703 --> 17:34.640
[In Italian accent] Spaghetti!
It just sounds so exotic!

17:34.641 --> 17:37.532
So, you want to go back to the boys'
lounge for some dessert? I have...

17:37.533 --> 17:40.162
[In Italian accent] Some jelly beans!

17:40.163 --> 17:42.192
No! Um...

17:42.193 --> 17:44.299
Let's go up to the roof.

17:44.300 --> 17:48.487
It's a beautiful night
to gaze at the stars.

17:48.488 --> 17:49.798
[Chuckles shyly]

17:49.799 --> 17:51.719
Okay.

17:52.726 --> 17:56.926
Look at the stars. They're beautiful.

17:57.030 --> 17:59.665
<i>But not as beautiful as you.</i>

17:59.666 --> 18:03.536
Yeah, the stars just go on forever.

18:03.537 --> 18:06.606
<i>Kind of like this evening.</i>

18:06.607 --> 18:08.407
So...

18:08.408 --> 18:10.743
Do you know anything
about constellations?

18:10.744 --> 18:12.778
Do I ever.

18:12.779 --> 18:16.616
Just eat a bran muffin and
things will start moving again.

18:16.617 --> 18:17.717
[Chuckles nervously]

18:17.718 --> 18:20.016
Fletcher. You are really...

18:20.017 --> 18:20.867
<i>Weird.</i>

18:20.868 --> 18:22.968
Special.

18:23.557 --> 18:25.658
Thanks. I think you're special, too.

18:25.659 --> 18:28.661
<i>Nothing girls like more
than healthy bowel tips.</i>

18:28.662 --> 18:31.482
<i>I am crushing it!</i>

18:35.769 --> 18:38.334
So, what should we do?

18:38.335 --> 18:40.901
How about this?

18:40.902 --> 18:42.942
[Gasps]

18:44.551 --> 18:45.948
What are you doing?

18:45.949 --> 18:48.614
I'm sorry. I thought
that's what you wanted.

18:48.615 --> 18:51.651
No, we're just friends!

18:51.652 --> 18:54.687
Besides, you have a
girlfriend! You love her!

18:54.688 --> 18:58.648
I don't love her. She's a goat.

18:58.659 --> 19:01.066
I was talking about Kennedy.

19:01.067 --> 19:04.530
I only started dating her
to get you interested in me.

19:04.531 --> 19:06.499
But clearly you're not.

19:06.500 --> 19:09.080
And I've been trying to break
up with Kennedy for weeks,

19:09.081 --> 19:11.302
but she never lets me get the words out.

19:11.303 --> 19:14.340
I totally missed that.

19:14.341 --> 19:16.801
[Phone beeps]

19:17.744 --> 19:19.512
It's a text from Kennedy.

19:19.513 --> 19:21.747
She wants me to meet
her in the boys' lounge.

19:21.748 --> 19:22.750
You know what?

19:22.751 --> 19:25.338
I'm just going to march in there and
blurt out that I'm breaking up with her,

19:25.339 --> 19:27.382
before she has a chance to say
anything and talk me out of it.

19:27.383 --> 19:29.622
No! Wait! You can't!

19:29.623 --> 19:32.743
Surprise! [Duck quacks]

19:34.241 --> 19:38.497
Kennedy, I don't know how to say
this, but you need to cancel the party.

19:38.498 --> 19:40.128
What do you mean cancel the party?

19:40.129 --> 19:43.602
I am so sorry, but Fletcher
is not in love with you.

19:43.603 --> 19:46.539
He told me he was planning to
burst in here and break up with you.

19:46.540 --> 19:50.211
I would have told you sooner, but
it was an unforeseen circumstance!

19:50.212 --> 19:53.105
All: Unforeseen circumstance!

19:53.106 --> 19:57.186
Man, you guys are some good hiders!

19:58.819 --> 20:00.720
I thought we were friends, Chyna.

20:00.721 --> 20:04.490
I can't believe you would come
in here and lie to my face!

20:04.491 --> 20:05.707
What are you talking about?

20:05.708 --> 20:07.686
You just want me to cancel
the party and break up

20:07.687 --> 20:10.252
with Fletcher so you can
have him for yourself!

20:10.253 --> 20:12.665
Kennedy, please, just
call off the party, quick!

20:12.666 --> 20:14.594
Because once those doors open,

20:14.595 --> 20:19.054
this is going to be the most
humiliating moment of your life!

20:19.055 --> 20:23.795
- Kennedy, I...
- All: Unforeseen circumstance!

20:26.299 --> 20:29.749
Kennedy, there's something
I need to tell you.

20:29.750 --> 20:31.650
Something I should have
said a long time ago.

20:31.651 --> 20:36.451
- Fletcher, wait...
- No, I need to say this.

20:36.623 --> 20:38.843
Kennedy...

20:39.004 --> 20:44.224
You are the sweetest
girlfriend in the whole world!

20:47.901 --> 20:51.621
This is why no one likes you.

20:52.739 --> 20:54.202
What happened?

20:54.203 --> 20:56.776
- I thought you didn't like her.
- I thought so too.

20:56.777 --> 21:00.728
But I guess I was so focused
on the fact she wasn't you I,

21:00.729 --> 21:02.815
couldn't see all her good qualities.

21:02.816 --> 21:06.076
And look, there are no
scary streamers or balloons.

21:06.077 --> 21:10.589
Only someone who really cares about
me would think of details like that.

21:10.590 --> 21:12.591
You're right.

21:12.592 --> 21:15.394
Well, I'm just happy you're happy.

21:15.395 --> 21:16.490
[Romantic song playing]

21:16.491 --> 21:18.397
Fletcher, Sweetie, you want to dance?

21:18.398 --> 21:19.865
It's a slow song.

21:19.866 --> 21:21.146
[Chuckles shyly]

21:21.147 --> 21:23.067
Okay.

21:24.638 --> 21:28.898
Now that was a surprise. [Duck quacks]

21:30.510 --> 21:33.133
Why did we name that duck Surprise?

21:33.134 --> 21:37.454
And teach it to come when we call it?

21:44.316 --> 21:50.216
There you are, Olive. What are
you still doing in the same room?

21:50.697 --> 21:52.024
Oh!

21:52.025 --> 21:54.733
You're working on geometry.

21:54.734 --> 21:56.269
Guess who I ran into?

21:56.270 --> 21:58.910
[Toilet flushes]

22:04.984 --> 22:06.844
Who?

22:07.581 --> 22:09.788
Principal Skidmore, the old maid.

22:09.789 --> 22:13.035
Who, unrelated to her
nickname, "the old maid"...

22:13.036 --> 22:16.456
Is literally the old maid.

22:17.161 --> 22:20.442
Because apparently I'm the new maid!

22:20.443 --> 22:26.079
Well you won't be the new maid for long
talking to your supervisor like that.

22:26.080 --> 22:29.837
I can't believe you've been charging
people $20 for me to clean their rooms

22:29.838 --> 22:32.863
while I've been paying
you $30 to tutor me!

22:32.864 --> 22:35.055
I don't know how you thought
you'd get away with this,

22:35.056 --> 22:37.511
but nobody pulls the wool over my eyes!

22:37.512 --> 22:41.519
Except for me, when I
put on a wool turtleneck!

22:41.520 --> 22:45.569
You're right. I'm sorry. I
have been treating you unfairly.

22:45.570 --> 22:47.727
And to make it up to you...

22:47.728 --> 22:50.544
I won't charge you $30 an hour anymore.

22:50.545 --> 22:53.545
I'll charge you 20.

22:54.330 --> 22:56.610
Thank you!

22:57.629 --> 23:01.155
No one takes advantage of Olive Doyle.

23:01.156 --> 23:06.676
Hey, new girl, get in here.
This is a two-person job.

23:07.407 --> 23:09.507
No one.
