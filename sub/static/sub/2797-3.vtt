<i>What the juice?</i>

00:59.959 --> 01:01.333
(grunting)

01:03.166 --> 01:04.917
You were gonna draw
a moustache on my face?

01:05.000 --> 01:07.000
What? No!

01:07.083 --> 01:09.500
I wanted to see how
you look with sideburns.

01:09.583 --> 01:13.125
And the word "garbanzo"
on your forehead.

01:13.208 --> 01:14.583
What were you doing in the Nomicon?

01:14.667 --> 01:17.417
You think being the Ninja
is all flipping and punching and kicking.

01:17.500 --> 01:20.083
And it is, which is awesome.

01:20.166 --> 01:22.333
But every so often,
my ninja-ing takes me

01:22.417 --> 01:25.875
to a wicked gross place
I call the Shnasty Zone.

01:28.000 --> 01:28.875
What?

01:28.959 --> 01:31.250
Zippity bop mm-mm.

01:35.208 --> 01:36.792
Shnasty!

01:36.875 --> 01:40.083
(Randy) <i>And there was a time</i>
<i>I saw Principal Slimovitz after school.</i>

01:41.333 --> 01:44.834
Yee-haw! I'm a big baby cowboy.

01:44.917 --> 01:47.500
(horse neighing)

01:47.583 --> 01:48.959
Aw, shnasty!

01:49.041 --> 01:52.166
(Randy) <i>And you know Taco Tuesday</i>
<i>in the cafeteria?</i>

01:54.000 --> 01:55.875

01:58.417 --> 02:00.208
Shnasty!

02:00.291 --> 02:02.375
(vomiting)

02:03.583 --> 02:05.917
(laughing) Whoa!

02:06.041 --> 02:09.083
Oh, thanks for nothing, Cunningham.

02:09.166 --> 02:11.291
Now, I can't eat the tacos.

02:12.208 --> 02:14.000
Nah, I'm still gonna eat the tacos.

02:14.083 --> 02:16.125
So, I went in the Nomicon
to see if there was some way

02:16.208 --> 02:19.458
to unremember that stuff.
Uh, like a mind-wipe.

02:19.542 --> 02:21.667
I could totally use a mind-wipe.

02:21.750 --> 02:23.750
You know that stupid
Whoopee World commercial?

02:23.834 --> 02:26.667
(upbeat electronic music)

02:28.208 --> 02:29.959
(screaming)

02:30.041 --> 02:33.000
I keep getting it stuck in my head.

02:33.083 --> 02:35.709
Whenever I hear it,
I can't think of anything else.

02:35.792 --> 02:36.875
Hmm?

02:36.959 --> 02:38.959
Don't you do it.

02:39.041 --> 02:40.792

02:47.875 --> 02:49.709
Turns out Becky's just a little bloated,

02:49.792 --> 02:51.542
so it was all just
a huge misunderstanding.

02:51.625 --> 02:53.458
(cheering)

02:53.542 --> 02:55.166
-Hey, Heidi.
-(scoffs)

02:55.250 --> 02:56.333
What the juice, Howard?

02:56.417 --> 02:58.166
Kinda doing a live gossip report here.

02:58.250 --> 03:00.959
Kinda got an emergency here.
I need lunch money.

03:01.041 --> 03:02.291
What about the money
Mom gave you?

03:02.375 --> 03:04.291
That was just brunch money.

03:04.375 --> 03:08.083
Gossip report, huh?
Weak, lame, snoozer.

03:08.166 --> 03:09.875
Look, if you want real gossip,

03:09.959 --> 03:12.542
I'll give you the real dish.

03:12.625 --> 03:14.875
Please. The only dish you know

03:14.959 --> 03:16.709
comes with sausage
and extra cheese.

03:16.792 --> 03:18.625
-(reaction)
<i>-</i> (boy) <i>Oh, man!</i>

03:18.709 --> 03:20.667
Real nice.

03:20.750 --> 03:22.875
Well, stuff this in your gossip hole.

03:22.959 --> 03:25.625
After school P. Slims
likes to mosey around

03:25.709 --> 03:28.250
in nothing but a ten gallon hat
and training pants.

03:28.333 --> 03:29.417
Nuh-uh!

03:29.500 --> 03:33.083
<i>Yee-haw!</i>
<i>I'm a big baby cowboy.</i>

03:33.166 --> 03:34.959
(kids laughing)

03:35.041 --> 03:36.834
After school is me time!

03:38.583 --> 03:40.500
(Heidi) All right, that was pretty juicy.

03:40.583 --> 03:42.250
-I'll give you a splart.
-(squishing)

03:42.333 --> 03:44.667
So, if you don't have
anything else, buh-bye.

03:44.750 --> 03:46.834
Sista, please,
they don't call me Double Dip

03:46.917 --> 03:48.208
just 'cause I like ice cream.

03:48.291 --> 03:50.792
I always got another scoop.

03:50.875 --> 03:52.792
-(groaning)
-You know Taco Tuesday?

03:52.875 --> 03:55.417
They oughta rename it Roadkill Tuesday.

03:55.500 --> 03:56.667
Nuh-uh!

03:56.750 --> 03:58.125
(bell ringing)

03:58.208 --> 03:59.709
(indistinct chattering)

03:59.792 --> 04:01.458
Awesome gossip, Howard!

04:01.542 --> 04:02.875
Double Dip!

04:02.959 --> 04:05.667
He saved us from eating
chipmunk-changas.

04:05.750 --> 04:06.750
Huh?

04:09.834 --> 04:12.125
Ah! That's the slow clap.

04:12.208 --> 04:13.625
You're getting the slow clap!

04:13.709 --> 04:14.875
(chuckling)

04:14.959 --> 04:17.250
We're getting the slow clap.

04:17.333 --> 04:19.875
Couldn't have done it
without your gossip.

04:19.959 --> 04:21.625
Couldn't have done it
without your big mouth.

04:23.291 --> 04:24.917
Howard, my paid views
are through the roof.

04:25.000 --> 04:26.166
-I need more gossip,
-(shouting)

04:26.250 --> 04:27.500
and I need it in three, two...

04:27.583 --> 04:29.583
(Heidi) <i>It's the Deep Dish</i>

04:29.667 --> 04:32.667
<i>with Howard "Double Dip"</i>
<i>Weinerman. Whoo!</i>

04:32.750 --> 04:35.917
<i>So, Howard, everyone's dying to know</i>
<i>what other juicy gossip you got.</i>

04:36.000 --> 04:37.125
(breathless) <i>Let's hear it.</i>

04:37.208 --> 04:39.333
<i>Uh...</i>

04:40.166 --> 04:41.583
I don't know.

04:47.500 --> 04:49.458
Don't embarrass me, Double Dip.

04:49.542 --> 04:51.291
You must know one secret.

04:51.375 --> 04:53.792
One thing nobody else knows.

04:53.875 --> 04:56.625
One single thing
someone's confided in you

04:56.709 --> 04:59.417
that you're not supposed to tell anyone.

04:59.500 --> 05:01.750
-(bell dings)
-I know who the Ninja is!

05:01.834 --> 05:03.208
-(gasping)
-Wha...

05:03.291 --> 05:05.000
-(exclaims)
-(splurting)

05:05.083 --> 05:07.625
You know who the Ninja is?

05:07.709 --> 05:09.542
Yes. Yes, I do.

05:09.625 --> 05:12.417
<i>So, if you want the deep dish,</i>

05:12.500 --> 05:14.333
<i>you'll have to tune in tomorrow.</i>

05:14.417 --> 05:15.959
<i>Double Dip!</i>

05:18.291 --> 05:21.208
Need a mind-wipe, need a mind-wipe,
need a mind-wipe, need a mind-wipe!

05:30.291 --> 05:31.917
(Randy) "The way to forget...

05:32.000 --> 05:33.875
is to remember."

05:34.000 --> 05:35.291
Not a mind-wipe!

05:36.041 --> 05:38.375
-(gasping)
-(humming)

05:38.375 --> 05:39.917
What were you gonna do this time?

05:40.000 --> 05:41.792
Write "Ninja" on my forehead?

05:41.875 --> 05:43.083
(nervous chuckle)

05:43.166 --> 05:45.792
I panicked, but I know how to fix it.

05:45.875 --> 05:47.792
I'll just string 'em along

05:47.875 --> 05:49.500
until you figure out how to fix it.

05:49.583 --> 05:51.625
Or I know, I could
mind-wipe the entire town.

05:51.709 --> 05:53.291
I like it, I like it.

05:53.375 --> 05:55.250
Except there is no mind-wipe!

05:55.333 --> 05:56.959
I don't like it.

05:57.041 --> 05:59.834
(Howard) Cunningham,
don't be so hard on yourself.

05:59.917 --> 06:01.625
This isn't your fault.

06:01.709 --> 06:03.709
I know it's not my fault.
It's <i>your</i> fault.

06:03.792 --> 06:05.417
It's your big mouth's fault.

06:05.500 --> 06:08.041
Huh. Didn't hear any complaining
during the slow clap.

06:08.125 --> 06:10.500
All I'm saying is,
if McFist saw the show,

06:10.583 --> 06:11.542
he might come after you.

06:11.625 --> 06:13.750
Oh, nobody's coming after me.

06:13.834 --> 06:16.458
Mr. Weinerman, your limousine is here.

06:16.542 --> 06:18.583
Listen, I gotta jet, my limo's here.

06:18.667 --> 06:20.875
Call me later and tell me
how you are gonna fix this.

06:21.625 --> 06:24.500
-Howard, you don't have a limo.
-(door closing)

06:25.667 --> 06:27.500
It occurs to me I don't have a limo.

06:28.917 --> 06:30.333
Ah!

06:32.000 --> 06:33.458
McFist.

06:38.750 --> 06:41.250
Hang in there, Double Dip.
I'm coming for ya'.

06:43.041 --> 06:44.375
(sighs)

06:46.083 --> 06:48.166
Ah! Ah!

06:48.250 --> 06:50.458
-(growling)
-Ah!

06:50.542 --> 06:53.291
I suppose you're wondering
why we brought you here.

06:53.375 --> 06:56.500
Uh, 'cause I said
I know who the Ninja is?

06:57.333 --> 07:00.792
Okay. But you must be wondering

07:00.875 --> 07:02.500
how we're going to get you to tell us.

07:02.583 --> 07:04.875
-By torturing me?
-By torturing you!

07:04.959 --> 07:06.709
-That's what he said.
-I know that!

07:10.291 --> 07:12.250
(exclaiming)

07:12.333 --> 07:15.041
(laughing)

07:15.125 --> 07:16.625
No, no! Okay, okay.

07:16.709 --> 07:19.291
Ninja Scarf Save! (shouting)

07:21.959 --> 07:23.375
Ninja Sprint!

07:28.083 --> 07:29.875
No, no, no, no!
Oh, no, no, no!

07:29.959 --> 07:31.542
Ninja Stop, Ninja Stop, Ninja Stop!

07:31.625 --> 07:35.375
No, no, no, no, no, no, eee.

07:35.458 --> 07:37.250
Bring out the Chair of Torture.

07:37.333 --> 07:39.041
The Rack! The Iron Maiden!

07:39.125 --> 07:40.291
-Ah!
<i>-The Bed of Anguish.</i>

07:40.375 --> 07:43.333
And, uh... Uh, feels like
I'm forgetting one.

07:43.375 --> 07:45.291
-Um...
-I'll get my Mindreader.

07:45.375 --> 07:47.083
We can figure out
what you're forgetting.

07:47.166 --> 07:48.875
You have a Mindreader?

07:48.959 --> 07:50.959
-Why didn't you tell me?
-You never asked!

07:51.041 --> 07:52.458
What am I supposed to be,
a Mindreader?

07:52.542 --> 07:54.417
(chuckling) You see what I did there?

07:54.500 --> 07:55.917
(chuckling)

07:56.000 --> 07:57.375
Bring in the Mindreader!

07:57.458 --> 07:58.875
Don't get smashed, don't get smashed.

07:58.959 --> 08:00.875
Now don't get smashed,
now do not get smashed!

08:00.959 --> 08:02.834
(shouting) Wait for it, wait for it.

08:02.917 --> 08:06.208
Wait for it, now! Ah! Ah!

08:06.291 --> 08:08.667
Scariest vent ever!

08:10.083 --> 08:12.375
It's oil o'clock somewhere.

08:12.458 --> 08:14.417
-Am I right?
-(laughing)

08:15.709 --> 08:17.000
Crack!

08:17.792 --> 08:19.208
Uh. Whoops.

08:27.417 --> 08:28.417
Get him.

08:29.834 --> 08:31.792
(thinking) <i>Okay,</i>
<i>don't think about the Ninja.</i>

08:31.875 --> 08:33.041
<i>Think about something else.</i>

08:33.125 --> 08:34.959
<i>Think about, uh... baseball.</i>

08:35.041 --> 08:38.291
I don't know anything
about baseball!

08:38.375 --> 08:40.625
(exclaiming)

08:40.709 --> 08:43.667
Sorry, fellas. Break time's over.

08:44.417 --> 08:45.667
(shouting)

08:50.458 --> 08:52.417
(Randy) Leftovers, popcorn.

08:52.500 --> 08:54.667
Oh, here it is. Robo-ape.

08:55.583 --> 08:57.875

(bell dings)

09:06.625 --> 09:08.834
(laughing)

09:14.583 --> 09:18.291
We're about to discover
the Ninja's secret identity.

09:18.375 --> 09:20.458
I can't wait to tell Mother.

09:28.041 --> 09:30.375
That's it? That's the Mindreader?

09:30.458 --> 09:32.834
Couldn't have made it any smaller?

09:32.917 --> 09:36.041
I could have, but then you wouldn't
have been able to see anything.

09:36.125 --> 09:38.917
(repeating) <i>Forget about the Ninja.</i>

09:39.000 --> 09:40.875
(Randy) Psst. Howard.

09:40.959 --> 09:43.000
Oh, no, I'm hearing his voice.

09:43.083 --> 09:44.542
No, Howard, up here.

09:44.625 --> 09:46.041
Hey, I'm trying to forget...

09:46.125 --> 09:48.709
Oh, Ninja. Took you long enough.

09:48.792 --> 09:50.583
Well, it's good to see you too, buddy.

09:50.667 --> 09:53.208
Right, sorry. You okay?

09:53.291 --> 09:54.333
Now get me outta here!

09:58.375 --> 10:00.542
(exclaiming)

10:00.625 --> 10:01.792
I can't get through.

10:04.458 --> 10:05.583
(shouts)

10:05.667 --> 10:08.500
Down in front,
you banana eating trashcans!

10:08.583 --> 10:10.709
Ninja, I haven't sold you out.

10:10.792 --> 10:12.792
I would never sell you out.

10:12.875 --> 10:15.834
-Thanks, pal.
-But, they have a Mindreader,

10:15.917 --> 10:17.917
so there's a pretty good chance

10:18.000 --> 10:19.333
-I'm gonna sell you out.
-What?

10:19.417 --> 10:21.417
You know what we could
really use right about now?

10:21.500 --> 10:23.583
A mind-wipe. Am I right?

10:23.667 --> 10:24.959
There is no mind-wipe!

10:25.041 --> 10:28.542
All the Nomicon said
was the way to forget is to remember.

10:29.667 --> 10:31.375
<i>♪ Whoop, whoop, whoop</i>
<i>Whoop, whoop, whoopee ♪</i>

10:31.458 --> 10:33.417
<i>♪ Whoop, whoop, whoop</i>
<i>Whoop, whoop, whoopee ♪</i>

10:33.500 --> 10:35.417
<i>-♪ Whoop, whoop, whoop ♪</i>
-Why would you do that?

10:35.500 --> 10:38.083
Now that stupid song
is all I can think about...

10:38.166 --> 10:40.333
Ohhhh.

10:42.542 --> 10:44.000
Show me the Ninja!

10:44.083 --> 10:47.417
<i>♪ Whoop, whoop, whoop</i>
<i>Whoop, whoop, whoopee ♪</i>

10:47.500 --> 10:50.125
What is that, some sort of song?

10:50.208 --> 10:51.834
It's the only thing on his mind.

10:51.917 --> 10:54.542
The only thing?
There's nothing else?

10:54.625 --> 10:56.709
Bubkis, didley, zippo.

10:56.792 --> 10:58.250
Shut it off, shut it off!

10:58.333 --> 11:00.583
This chucklehead doesn't know
who the Ninja is.

11:00.667 --> 11:01.959
(McFist) Get him outta here!

11:02.041 --> 11:03.333
Whoopee.

11:05.834 --> 11:07.250
Listen, Cunningham.

11:07.333 --> 11:09.959
I'm sorry my big mouth
got us in so much trouble.

11:10.041 --> 11:11.583
I take full responsibility.

11:11.667 --> 11:13.500
Howard, we're cool.

11:15.291 --> 11:17.875
But this is kinda your fault
too, a little bit, right?

11:17.959 --> 11:19.750
I mean, you know
I can't keep a secret,

11:19.834 --> 11:21.834
and it's not like I ever asked
if you were the Ninja,

11:21.917 --> 11:24.083
-you just told me, so...
-Howard.

11:24.166 --> 11:26.542
-You know what, we'll call it even.
-Oh, here's the thing.

11:26.625 --> 11:29.041
The whole school thinks you're revealing
the Ninja's identity.

11:29.125 --> 11:30.750
So, how are you gonna
handle that, Double D?

11:30.834 --> 11:33.917
Relax. I got this.

11:35.250 --> 11:37.667
So, Howard, who's the Ninja?

11:37.750 --> 11:39.625
The Ninja is...

11:39.709 --> 11:41.375
<i>♪ Whoop, whoop, whoop</i>
<i>Whoop, whoop, whoopee ♪</i>

11:41.458 --> 11:43.083
<i>♪ Whoop, whoop, whoop</i>
<i>Whoop, whoop, whoopee ♪</i>

11:43.166 --> 11:46.333
Howard! I knew you didn't know! Ah!

11:46.417 --> 11:48.041
<i>♪ Whoop, whoop, whoop</i>
<i>Whoop, whoop, whoopee ♪</i>

11:48.125 --> 11:49.750
<i>♪ Whoop, whoop, whoop</i>
<i>Whoop, whoop, whoopee ♪</i>

11:49.834 --> 11:52.834
<i>♪ Whoop, whoop, whoop</i>
<i>Whoop, whoop, whoopee ♪</i>

11:52.917 --> 11:54.875
<i>♪ Whoop, whoop, whoop,</i>
<i>whoop, whoop, whoop ♪</i>

11:54.959 --> 11:57.917
(bell ringing)

11:58.625 --> 12:01.375
Is it me, or is Coach Green
completely insane?

12:01.458 --> 12:04.333
Well, I think he's just trying
to keep gym class interesting.

12:05.709 --> 12:06.834
(laughing)

12:06.917 --> 12:09.083
This baby has a light trigger.

12:10.041 --> 12:11.333
Nope, he's totally insane.

12:11.417 --> 12:12.458
-So.
-(shrieking)

12:12.542 --> 12:14.542
Who's ready to play hopscotch?

12:14.625 --> 12:15.959
(cell phone ringing)

12:16.041 --> 12:18.208
Uh-huh, uh-huh. Okay, cheers.

12:18.291 --> 12:20.333
Apparently, your "fire marshal"

12:20.417 --> 12:24.000
has some safety concerns,
so hopscotch is off.

12:25.125 --> 12:26.792
I know, I'm bummed too.

12:26.875 --> 12:29.250
Guess I'll just have to go
with my back-up plan.

12:29.333 --> 12:31.291
Climbing a rope!

12:32.166 --> 12:33.750
See, that is refreshingly rational.

12:33.834 --> 12:35.375
But to ensure a spirited romp,

12:35.458 --> 12:37.667
I've enlisted a few of your classmates

12:37.750 --> 12:40.709
to assault you with balls
as you ascend!

12:40.792 --> 12:42.417
Aw, we just got greened!

12:42.500 --> 12:43.792
Greened hard.

12:45.166 --> 12:47.709
Mick! Now we got
one less crushing ball!

12:47.792 --> 12:49.000
(whistle)

12:49.500 --> 12:53.166
Ready to give it a go... Stevens.

12:53.250 --> 12:55.500
Ha! You're gonna eat it, Stevens.

12:56.959 --> 12:58.333
According to his family physician,

12:58.417 --> 13:01.792
young Stevens here has some
sort of "medical condition"

13:01.875 --> 13:04.083
that forbids him from climbing a rope.

13:04.166 --> 13:05.625
(blowing the trumpet)

13:05.709 --> 13:09.750
Well, then, Mr. Weinerman,
you're first to shimmy the wipple.

13:09.834 --> 13:12.834
-(Howard muttering)
-(bird calling)

13:12.917 --> 13:14.625
(grunts, inhales)

13:14.709 --> 13:16.625
-(bell ringing)
-Ooh!

13:16.709 --> 13:18.041
Oh, man!

13:18.125 --> 13:19.875
Outta time. (chuckles)

13:19.959 --> 13:21.542
And I was just about to get
my shimmy on.

13:21.625 --> 13:23.333
Chin up, Weinerman.

13:23.417 --> 13:25.333
You'll be first on the rope tomorrow.

13:25.417 --> 13:26.709
Stupid wipple!

13:26.792 --> 13:28.417
(groaning)

13:30.750 --> 13:33.709
I do not want to climb that rope.

13:35.375 --> 13:37.750
We're gonna crush you tomorrow!

13:37.834 --> 13:41.375
Crush you like the thing that crushes...

13:41.458 --> 13:43.000
other things!

13:43.083 --> 13:44.625
(shouting) Yeah!

13:44.709 --> 13:45.792
(shrieks)

13:45.875 --> 13:47.542
(laughing)

13:47.625 --> 13:50.417
Mick, bro. You're killin' me.

13:51.041 --> 13:54.500
What would you say if I said
you don't have to climb that rope?

13:54.583 --> 13:57.291
I would say great!
And then I might ask how.

13:57.375 --> 14:00.542
I don't know.
But I bet the answer lies within...

14:00.625 --> 14:02.208
the Nomicon!

14:02.291 --> 14:03.375
That's your math book.

14:03.458 --> 14:06.083
I meant the Nomicon!

14:06.166 --> 14:07.792
(Randy) Listen, Nomicon.

14:07.875 --> 14:09.709
You and I both know Howard
can't climb that rope.

14:09.792 --> 14:12.625
We have to help him.
Whatta ya' got?

14:16.291 --> 14:18.542
(evil laughter)

14:19.250 --> 14:23.083
"The best way to avoid an attack,
is to avoid an attack?"

14:24.000 --> 14:26.458
What the juice?
Fine. You know what?

14:26.542 --> 14:27.959
Forget it, Nomicon.

14:28.041 --> 14:29.250
If you didn't want to help,

14:29.333 --> 14:31.917
all you had to do
was not suck me in here.

14:32.000 --> 14:35.125
Okay, the floor is splitting.

14:35.208 --> 14:36.667
(screaming)

14:36.750 --> 14:38.750
(grunts)

14:38.834 --> 14:40.333
(moaning)

14:40.375 --> 14:41.625
So, you got it?

14:41.709 --> 14:43.083
Book was a dead-end.

14:43.166 --> 14:45.291
-And kinda jerky about it.
-(growling)

14:45.375 --> 14:47.625
(blowing the trumpet)

14:47.709 --> 14:48.750
Ha-ha!

14:48.834 --> 14:53.709
Stevens. Thinks he's so cool 'cause
he's got that fancy doctor's note.

14:53.792 --> 14:55.458
(sigh) Wish I had IBS.

14:55.542 --> 14:56.917
Ah, that's it, Howard!

14:57.000 --> 14:58.417
We need a doctor's note.

14:58.500 --> 15:01.083
We need a golden doctor's note.

15:01.166 --> 15:03.375
Cunningham.
Everyone and their brother's

15:03.458 --> 15:04.667
gone looking for that notepad.

15:04.750 --> 15:06.542
It doesn't exist, it's a myth.

15:06.625 --> 15:09.250
A fairytale seventh graders
tell each other at sleepovers.

15:09.333 --> 15:10.834
Right now it's our only hope.

15:10.917 --> 15:13.291
We just have to find a way into...

15:13.375 --> 15:15.417
the old gym.

15:16.583 --> 15:19.041
This is a terrible plan.
Just want you to know that.

15:19.125 --> 15:21.458
No. No. No.

15:21.542 --> 15:24.417
-Ah!
-Greetings, normals.

15:24.500 --> 15:26.875
If you seek the entrance
to the old gym,

15:26.959 --> 15:30.458
it lies not in this tin tomb.

15:30.542 --> 15:32.875
(giggles) Ouch.

15:32.959 --> 15:35.333
-Julian?
-Weirdo.

15:35.417 --> 15:37.500
I haunt this locker room every day,

15:37.583 --> 15:39.375
yet the entrance eludes me.

15:39.458 --> 15:41.250
And I even possess a map.

15:41.333 --> 15:44.125
But I've never been able
to decipher the riddle.

15:44.208 --> 15:46.291
Solve it, and you can join me

15:46.375 --> 15:49.250
on a quest into the deep,
cavernous void.

15:49.333 --> 15:51.333
I'm awesome at riddles.

15:51.417 --> 15:54.208
"In this room, amid
the sweat stink and such,

15:54.291 --> 15:57.375
the entrance lies
where no boy would ever touch."

15:57.458 --> 15:59.041
Where's the one place
in a boys' locker room

15:59.125 --> 16:00.667
no one's ever touched?

16:00.750 --> 16:02.917
-(zipping)
-(flushing)

16:05.625 --> 16:07.166
Soap dispenser!

16:09.542 --> 16:11.375
What'd I tell you? It's a myth.

16:11.458 --> 16:13.000
(shrieking)

16:15.208 --> 16:16.667
(sniffs)

16:16.750 --> 16:19.166
Mmm, now there's a scent

16:19.250 --> 16:22.000
I haven't smelled in some time.

16:22.083 --> 16:26.291
Someone's searching
for the golden doctor's note, eh?

16:26.375 --> 16:29.250
-(squeaking)
-I don't know what I'm going to do!

16:29.333 --> 16:30.959
I just found out.

16:31.041 --> 16:33.125
(all shouting)

16:33.208 --> 16:35.166
(grunting)

16:36.041 --> 16:37.458
(all) Whoa!

16:37.542 --> 16:38.709
(Julian) The old gym.

16:38.792 --> 16:42.083
Just as I imagined.
So dark, so creepy.

16:42.166 --> 16:43.500
So marvelous!

16:43.583 --> 16:45.000
You're a freak. You know that, right?

16:45.083 --> 16:45.959
(giggles)

16:46.041 --> 16:49.834
"Never stray from the course,
follow the path across the horse."

16:49.917 --> 16:52.750
Horse? Pommel horses!

16:52.834 --> 16:54.500
Awesome at riddles me!

16:54.583 --> 16:57.041
So, to get out of doing gym
stuff, we gotta do gym stuff?

17:01.375 --> 17:04.250
(grumbling)

17:06.375 --> 17:08.458
(grumbling)

17:10.959 --> 17:12.625
-(grunts)
-Howard!

17:12.709 --> 17:14.417
(screams)

17:16.291 --> 17:18.792
-Are you okay?
-Oh, yeah, I'm fine.

17:18.875 --> 17:20.500
No, I'm not okay! I almost died!

17:20.583 --> 17:22.291
(Julian) How I envy thee.

17:22.375 --> 17:24.834
Death is so cool.

17:24.917 --> 17:26.458
(giggles) Look!

17:26.542 --> 17:29.083
I found an adorable
instrument of torture.

17:30.291 --> 17:31.917
Isn't it delightful?

17:32.000 --> 17:33.875
(shrieking) My hat!

17:37.000 --> 17:38.709
Hang on, Julian.

17:40.875 --> 17:43.792
(screaming)

17:43.875 --> 17:46.750
I don't wanna die!
Death isn't cool!

17:46.834 --> 17:48.959
I knew Lord Creepy was a fraud.

17:50.792 --> 17:52.125
Ah!

17:55.208 --> 17:56.250
(engine whining)

17:56.333 --> 17:58.291
Come on, Howard. Pull, big fella.

17:58.375 --> 18:00.125
What do you think I'm doing?

18:05.000 --> 18:08.333
Any other must-see sights
on our Tour de Terror, Julian?

18:08.417 --> 18:09.667
(Randy) Julian?

18:09.750 --> 18:11.750
Julian want a wittle snackie.

18:11.834 --> 18:13.792
I think Julian's gone bye-bye.

18:13.875 --> 18:15.417
This is getting a little too real.

18:15.500 --> 18:17.625
I'll get the notes, you stay with Julian.

18:17.709 --> 18:18.625
(grumbles)

18:18.709 --> 18:21.166
-Hold me!
-Yeah, I don't think so.

18:21.250 --> 18:23.000
-Cunningham, wait up.
-(moaning)

18:24.750 --> 18:26.041
(sniffing)

18:26.125 --> 18:29.041
Finally. Sheer terror.

18:29.125 --> 18:32.333
Go, go, foul funk,

18:32.417 --> 18:35.083
and destroy the notes.

18:35.166 --> 18:36.959
Be gone!

18:37.041 --> 18:40.542
(evil laughter)

18:42.417 --> 18:44.542
(chuckling) There it is.

18:44.625 --> 18:46.917
That must be where the golden
doctor's notes are.

18:47.041 --> 18:49.125
All we gotta do to get out
of climbing Green's rope is...

18:49.208 --> 18:50.959
climb a rope.

18:51.041 --> 18:52.417
How's that for irony?

18:52.500 --> 18:55.750
I'll just ninja out, grab the notepad,
we'll get Julian and we bounce.

19:03.083 --> 19:05.333
(grunting)

19:05.417 --> 19:06.875
You all dressed? Good.

19:06.959 --> 19:08.959
-'Cause, that!
-Whoa.

19:10.583 --> 19:13.750
Probably shouldn't have left
Julian behind.

19:13.834 --> 19:16.291
(grunting)

19:16.375 --> 19:18.709
Boom. Stuck it!

19:24.583 --> 19:26.792
Ah, sweet ninja, that hurt.

19:26.875 --> 19:27.750
Hey, watch it.

19:27.834 --> 19:29.667
Howard, you can climb a rope?

19:29.750 --> 19:31.125
Of course I can climb a rope.

19:32.125 --> 19:34.208
But we're down here risking our lives

19:34.291 --> 19:35.875
because I thought
you couldn't climb a rope.

19:35.959 --> 19:38.542
Well, that's dumb.
You should have asked me.

19:38.625 --> 19:40.291
Why wouldn't I be able
to climb a rope?

19:40.375 --> 19:42.709
(gasping) It's because
you think I'm...

19:42.792 --> 19:45.375
No! No, no, no.
No, it's not that.

19:45.458 --> 19:49.583
You're perfect exactly the way you are.

19:49.667 --> 19:52.083
Don't patronize me, Ninja.
Go on, say it. Go ahead.

19:52.166 --> 19:54.041
You have tiny hands, all right?

19:54.125 --> 19:56.667
I knew it! And I prefer delicate.

19:56.750 --> 19:58.291
Yo, that almost hit me.

19:59.792 --> 20:04.208
"The best way to avoid an attack
is to avoid an attack."

20:04.291 --> 20:06.166
Ninja, avoid the attack.

20:06.250 --> 20:07.291
(grunts)

20:07.375 --> 20:09.375
Climb, climb, climb.

20:09.458 --> 20:10.834
Stop yelling at me!

20:13.083 --> 20:14.375
Jackpot.

20:17.375 --> 20:18.959
(gurgling)

20:20.417 --> 20:21.458
Yah!

20:31.750 --> 20:33.917
I got the notes.

20:34.000 --> 20:35.792
(screaming)

20:35.875 --> 20:37.500
Whoa, boy.

20:40.333 --> 20:42.041
And I broke the office.

20:44.291 --> 20:46.083
(grunts)

20:48.000 --> 20:50.583
No! No!

20:50.667 --> 20:52.417
Hey! I climbed up a rope to get those.

20:54.542 --> 20:56.542
-Stop him, Ninja.
-Okay.

20:56.625 --> 20:58.291
-Stop him!
-I said okay!

20:58.375 --> 20:59.583
Gotta de-stank him.

20:59.667 --> 21:01.917
There must be something
he holds dear.

21:03.250 --> 21:06.083
The hat! Totally figured it out.

21:13.250 --> 21:14.166
(shrieking)

21:18.208 --> 21:20.125
One note left.

21:20.208 --> 21:21.750
Don't mind if I do.

21:21.834 --> 21:23.333
Ninja Hat Punch.

21:26.542 --> 21:28.792
No, no, no!

21:28.875 --> 21:31.208
My chaos. Where's the misery?

21:31.291 --> 21:33.667
Where's the suffering?

21:33.750 --> 21:35.166
(squeaking)

21:37.750 --> 21:41.333
Mr. Wienerman.
The wipple beckons.

21:41.417 --> 21:44.250
(chuckles) I don't think so, Coach G.

21:44.333 --> 21:46.083
Wait. There's something
I need to tell you.

21:46.166 --> 21:49.333
I know, you're sorry
you almost got me killed

21:49.417 --> 21:52.083
and completely insulted me
by assuming I couldn't climb a rope.

21:52.166 --> 21:54.125
Well, yeah, that. But also...

21:54.208 --> 21:55.709
Shhh!

21:55.792 --> 21:57.333
We're good.

21:57.417 --> 21:59.750
All that matters
is that I'm not going up that rope.

21:59.834 --> 22:03.000
-About that.
-Read it and weep, Green.

22:03.709 --> 22:06.166
Ten percent off
a Charlie Cluckers chicken bucket.

22:06.250 --> 22:07.417
Is this a bribe?

22:08.000 --> 22:09.500
What? Gimme that!

22:09.583 --> 22:10.834
<i>-♪ Charlie's ♪</i>
-(chicken crowing)

22:10.917 --> 22:13.750
What have you done?

22:13.834 --> 22:15.500
Well, Julian shared his map,

22:15.583 --> 22:17.875
and he really fell apart down there.

22:17.959 --> 22:19.417
So, I figured since
you can climb a rope...

22:19.500 --> 22:21.875
Stop talking!
We're not good anymore.

22:21.959 --> 22:24.000
Don't worry. I have a new plan.

22:24.083 --> 22:27.875
The best way to avoid an attack
is to avoid an attack.

22:28.667 --> 22:31.208
(all shouting)

22:31.291 --> 22:32.959
Follow my lead!

22:33.917 --> 22:36.083
Swing, guys, swing.

22:36.166 --> 22:38.041
Climb, Howard, climb.

22:38.125 --> 22:41.041
New strategy. Pound the nerds.

22:41.834 --> 22:43.750
(Bash) Hit that little guy!

22:43.834 --> 22:45.417
-(Randy) Run!
-Huh.

22:45.500 --> 22:47.250
Climbing ropes ain't so bad.

22:47.333 --> 22:48.792
(giggles)

22:48.875 --> 22:52.250
(groans) But I have the note!

22:52.333 --> 22:56.083
(sad trombone)

22:56.667 --> 23:01.375
(theme music playing)
