00:05.375 --> 00:07.125
The grand opening of the new magic shop

00:07.208 --> 00:09.709
is a great opportunity for people
to sample our smoothies.

00:10.083 --> 00:11.375
I even made a sign.

00:11.458 --> 00:13.291
All right. You set 'em up, I'll move 'em.

00:13.375 --> 00:15.250
I used to sell peanuts at the ball park.

00:15.959 --> 00:17.291
Smoothie here!

00:17.375 --> 00:18.667
Get it now! Get it now!

00:18.750 --> 00:20.166
Who wants an ice-cold smoothie?

00:20.250 --> 00:21.500
Smooth... oh, yeah.

00:24.709 --> 00:26.166
Who else wants a smoothie here?

00:26.250 --> 00:28.125
Why don't we just use the sign?

00:29.125 --> 00:32.166
Uh, where did all the other samples go?
I just poured 20 of them.

00:34.041 --> 00:34.959
I don't know.

00:36.667 --> 00:37.917
I hope you get a brain freeze.

00:38.291 --> 00:39.834
Can't freeze what you don't have.

00:40.959 --> 00:42.625
Come on, Taylor.
We have more samples inside.

00:43.375 --> 00:44.250
No, you don't.

00:47.458 --> 00:48.291
Yo, Jack.

00:48.417 --> 00:50.208
You figure out a way
to get to Japan to see Kim?

00:50.500 --> 00:52.667
No. Dude, the flight's 600 bucks.

00:53.041 --> 00:54.375
I guess I'll just call her again.

00:54.458 --> 00:56.625
- Isn't that expensive, too?
- Not the way I do it.

00:57.208 --> 00:59.250
Hey, Kim, miss you. Things are good.
Hope you're well, bye.

01:00.208 --> 01:01.291
She said to say hi.

01:02.959 --> 01:05.625
Guys, check out what I just got
at the magic shop.

01:06.083 --> 01:07.667
Dude, it looks like a giant hankie.

01:08.792 --> 01:10.542
Do you know how much snot that could hold?

01:10.959 --> 01:12.250
We can all use it. I'll go first.

01:12.333 --> 01:13.625
What... No, no, no. Give me that.

01:13.875 --> 01:15.083
It's for a trick.

01:15.166 --> 01:17.458
Behold, the dancing ball.

01:19.792 --> 01:23.458
The allure of the illusion
makes it impossible to look away.

01:23.542 --> 01:25.458
Hello, Seaford.

01:26.542 --> 01:28.417
I said it was impossible to look away.

01:30.291 --> 01:32.750
Oh, that's the bad boy
of magic, Ronnie Blaze.

01:38.083 --> 01:39.667
For their grand opening today,

01:39.750 --> 01:43.625
Ta-da Magic has brought me here
to blow your minds.

01:46.458 --> 01:48.375
Follow me to the beach,

01:48.458 --> 01:50.417
where I will switch bodies with...

01:50.917 --> 01:51.917
A turtle.

01:52.834 --> 01:54.000
Oh!

01:54.208 --> 01:55.333
Dude, let's go.

01:59.667 --> 02:01.417
Smoothie here!

02:01.750 --> 02:03.125
Hey, where'd everybody go?

02:03.583 --> 02:07.125
Down to the beach to watch
the bad boy of magic, Ronnie Blaze.

02:07.208 --> 02:08.458
He is such a fake.

02:08.542 --> 02:11.000
Oh, I love Blaze. His magic is so real.

02:15.709 --> 02:16.917
Where you going with that turtle?

02:17.000 --> 02:20.250
This happens to be Ronnie Blaze.
He's taking everyone for pizza.

02:22.208 --> 02:23.917
That turtle's Ronnie Blaze?

02:25.834 --> 02:27.500
Can I get an autograph, Mr. Blaze?

03:09.583 --> 03:11.583
Milton, what's your big problem
with Ronnie Blaze anyway?

03:11.917 --> 03:15.125
Real magicians like Houdini,
Harry Blackstone, and Mark Wilson

03:15.208 --> 03:17.792
spent their lives mastering their craft.

03:17.875 --> 03:21.291
A month ago, Blaze was an underwear model
who stumbled into a magic career.

03:21.625 --> 03:24.125
Good things never happen to me
when I stumble around in my underwear.

03:25.875 --> 03:27.291
Hey, well, people love Blaze.

03:27.375 --> 03:30.667
I heard he gets paid $5,000 an appearance.

03:31.000 --> 03:31.917
Milton, that's it.

03:32.542 --> 03:34.709
Dude, you're a magician.
People pay a lot of money for it.

03:35.208 --> 03:37.667
We could start by doing birthday parties
at the bowling alley.

03:37.750 --> 03:38.834
I'll be your manager.

03:39.834 --> 03:44.458
The only reason I would do this is to show
people what a real magician looks like.

03:45.583 --> 03:46.750
But I would need an assistant.

03:47.375 --> 03:50.000
They would need to be a
real piece of eye candy.

03:56.834 --> 03:58.709
Oh, no. There is no way
you're getting me to wear

03:58.792 --> 04:00.750
a sequined vest and a matching bow tie.

04:09.041 --> 04:10.041
I'm so in.

04:14.709 --> 04:15.709
Oh, you have got to hide me.

04:15.792 --> 04:17.375
There is a girl outside
from the country club

04:17.458 --> 04:18.875
my family belonged to when we were rich.

04:19.250 --> 04:20.792
I don't want her to know what I've become.

04:21.083 --> 04:22.917
I've been there.

04:23.000 --> 04:23.959
You are there.

04:25.208 --> 04:29.583
Well, I wouldn't be there if I was part
of the rich, successful country-club set.

04:29.667 --> 04:31.166
You know, I tried to join one once.

04:31.250 --> 04:32.417
They told me I wasn't...

04:34.458 --> 04:35.709
...classy enough.

04:36.083 --> 04:37.750
Okay, she is gonna be here any second.

04:37.834 --> 04:38.959
You have got to help me...

04:39.041 --> 04:40.291
Aah...

04:40.375 --> 04:41.917
Hi!

04:42.000 --> 04:43.709
Brie!

04:48.166 --> 04:49.750
Tay-tay!

04:50.083 --> 04:51.041
Ew,

04:51.125 --> 04:53.000
what is this place?

04:53.291 --> 04:54.792
It smells like...

04:55.375 --> 04:56.375
Poor people.

05:00.667 --> 05:03.125
Uh, it's a gym where people work out.

05:03.750 --> 05:05.417
Oh, I hired a girl to do that for me.

05:05.959 --> 05:07.583
So, where have you been?

05:07.959 --> 05:10.208
I haven't seen you or your parents
at the country club.

05:10.291 --> 05:11.709
Well, I've been really busy.

05:12.208 --> 05:14.333
My parents are in Europe...

05:14.709 --> 05:17.834
Doing things that require
a lot of money...

05:18.667 --> 05:20.375
which we still have.

05:21.083 --> 05:22.333
Aww...

05:22.667 --> 05:23.542
I hope that doesn't mean

05:23.625 --> 05:26.083
you're going to miss the Father-Daughter
Golf Tournament this weekend.

05:26.709 --> 05:28.750
The four of us play together every year.

05:29.125 --> 05:32.417
Well, unfortunately,
my dad can't make it, so...

05:32.500 --> 05:35.750
Her favorite Uncle Rudy is gonna step in.

05:36.375 --> 05:38.750
Great, we'll see you at tee time.

05:38.834 --> 05:42.041
You know what, let's just skip the tea
and play some golf. Am I right, Tay-Tay?

05:46.625 --> 05:47.792
Your Uncle is funny.

05:49.542 --> 05:50.709
There's that smell again.

05:53.291 --> 05:54.667
- Bye.
- Bye.

05:56.500 --> 05:57.875
Okay, what are you doing?

05:57.959 --> 05:59.792
I am helping both of us.

06:00.166 --> 06:02.750
It's always been my dream
to join a country club,

06:02.834 --> 06:04.667
and if you make an appearance,
then no one will know

06:04.750 --> 06:07.542
that you're a washed-up has-been,
who spends her days squeezing fruit--

06:07.625 --> 06:08.458
Point taken.

06:08.542 --> 06:12.166
I'm in, but Brie's dad is pretty serious
about golf. I hope you're good.

06:12.834 --> 06:14.542
Let's just say the last time I played,

06:14.625 --> 06:16.834
they talked about it
on the seven o'clock news.

06:16.917 --> 06:18.458
What, did you get a hole-in-one
or something?

06:18.542 --> 06:21.458
No, I accidentally shanked a ball
into the zoo and hit a hippo in the...

06:21.542 --> 06:23.375
Oh, no, I guess I did get a hole-in-one.

06:28.208 --> 06:31.208
And now the three single, solid rings
I showed you,

06:31.291 --> 06:32.917
- are all connected!
-

06:37.709 --> 06:39.417
Thank you. Glad you enjoyed the trick.

06:39.750 --> 06:40.792
I didn't.

06:40.875 --> 06:42.458
I was clapping because it's over.

06:42.542 --> 06:44.125
Why can't you be more like Ronnie Blaze?

06:44.208 --> 06:45.750
Why can't you shut your face?

06:47.125 --> 06:48.959
I mean, Happy Birthday, Teddy.

06:57.625 --> 06:58.875
What are you doing?

06:58.959 --> 07:00.709
I had to do something.
You're dying up here.

07:00.792 --> 07:02.417
The amazing Krupnick is gonna take a five.

07:02.500 --> 07:03.792
Make it a ten.

07:07.500 --> 07:09.750
Milton, you're dying up there, man.
You got any better tricks?

07:09.834 --> 07:11.250
Oh, you tell me.

07:14.041 --> 07:15.291
That's a "no."

07:16.500 --> 07:18.417
Milton, the magic you're doing
is boring, man.

07:18.500 --> 07:20.625
We need to find a way to make you
entertaining by tomorrow.

07:21.333 --> 07:22.583
Hey, what's tomorrow?

07:22.667 --> 07:24.417
Oh, I convinced Mama Sparkle's
daughter, Tori

07:24.500 --> 07:26.458
to hold her sweet 16 auditions
at the dojo.

07:26.792 --> 07:29.834
Mama's gonna pay $1,500
to whoever they book.

07:30.375 --> 07:32.166
Guys, this is the break
we've been looking for, man.

07:32.250 --> 07:34.041
We need to find a big,
flashy trick for the finale.

07:34.125 --> 07:38.542
Oh, excuse me. My color-switching scarves
will have people talking for days.

07:39.000 --> 07:42.583
I start off with a simple white silk,
and you'll never guess what happens.

07:42.959 --> 07:44.375
It switches colors.

07:46.375 --> 07:47.917
I'm not changing my act.

07:48.000 --> 07:50.667
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I'm hiding a bunny in my pants

07:50.750 --> 07:51.917
and it's feeding time.

07:57.917 --> 07:59.125
Oh, somebody was hungry.

08:01.333 --> 08:02.875
<i>♪ Kickin' it with you! ♪</i>

08:03.375 --> 08:07.667
Video golf simulators are a great way
to work on technique, form and focus.

08:09.750 --> 08:11.333
-
<i>Perfect shot!</i>

08:11.750 --> 08:13.375
This machine is amazing.

08:19.166 --> 08:20.834
-
<i>Terrible shot!</i>

08:22.041 --> 08:23.500
<i>That shot makes me feel sad.</i>

08:24.125 --> 08:25.208
Turn it off.

08:27.625 --> 08:30.542
Don't worry, I will more than make up
for it on the putting green.

08:31.083 --> 08:34.000
I spent many a date night alone
at the Party Town Putt-Putt.

08:39.625 --> 08:41.000
Told you. Once I'm on the green--

08:48.250 --> 08:50.625
Sorry I'm late. I can't find
my manager and assistant.

08:50.709 --> 08:51.959
I'll be ready in a flash.

08:52.709 --> 08:55.667
Not an actual flash.
I don't subscribe to Randy pyrotechnics.

08:57.750 --> 08:59.709
Take your time, the next act is up.

09:02.709 --> 09:04.125
Ladies and gentlemen.

09:04.208 --> 09:06.583
Martinez Entertainment
is proud to present...

09:07.667 --> 09:08.834
The Raven.

09:08.917 --> 09:09.875
"The Raven?"

09:15.375 --> 09:17.959
Oh, you've got to be kidding me.

09:20.083 --> 09:23.041
And now, The Raven will take flight.

09:36.250 --> 09:37.625
Ta-da!

09:38.208 --> 09:40.709
Jack's not a magician!
He just ran down the stairs!

09:40.792 --> 09:42.125
Everybody knows how he did that.

09:42.375 --> 09:44.500
I have no idea how he did that.

09:47.917 --> 09:49.834
What do you think you're doing?
I thought we were a team.

09:50.208 --> 09:51.750
Well, you said you wouldn't
change your act.

09:51.834 --> 09:53.291
So, we decided to do our own thing.

09:56.291 --> 09:58.417
Mother, I want The Raven for my party.

09:58.834 --> 10:00.917
But you haven't even seen
the rest of the magicians.

10:01.166 --> 10:03.417
They may be magicians, but they aren't...

10:03.875 --> 10:04.750
The Raven.

10:08.333 --> 10:10.792
Do any of you do The Spikes of Death?

10:12.583 --> 10:15.041
Ooh. The spikes of death.

10:15.125 --> 10:17.000
All right, raven. You're booked.

10:17.083 --> 10:18.333
- Thank you.
- Gah!

10:18.417 --> 10:20.041
This is an outrage!

10:21.667 --> 10:24.208
Sorry, buddy. Job's already been booked
by The Raven.

10:25.542 --> 10:27.291
Apparently, none of us are good enough.

10:32.458 --> 10:34.208
Okay, he actually might have been
good enough.

10:38.667 --> 10:40.166
<i>♪ Kickin' it with you! ♪</i>

10:42.041 --> 10:44.625
This whole thing is a joke.
Since when is Jack a magician?

10:44.709 --> 10:46.709
Okay, first of all, babe, it's The Raven.

10:48.000 --> 10:49.875
And second of all, he's not a magician.

10:49.959 --> 10:52.917
He's the master of illusion.

10:54.291 --> 10:58.250
Well, apparently our
friendship was just an illusion!

10:59.875 --> 11:03.166
Come on, Milton. We asked you to spice up
your act, but you wouldn't do it.

11:03.250 --> 11:05.041
Oh, so instead
you just stab me in the back?

11:05.125 --> 11:07.000
You gotta stay current
with the times, babe.

11:07.083 --> 11:10.375
If you call me babe one more time,
I will make your face disappear.

11:12.166 --> 11:13.041
Whatever.

11:13.917 --> 11:15.083
He can't do that, can he?

11:16.625 --> 11:19.000
And how are you two gonna
perform The Spikes of Death?

11:19.083 --> 11:20.875
It's only the most
dangerous trick of all time.

11:20.959 --> 11:23.583
Uh, excuse me. I am an entertainer

11:23.667 --> 11:24.959
and I am not scar...

11:25.041 --> 11:27.125
I'm sorry, did he say "of all time"?

11:27.709 --> 11:29.792
Jack, The Spikes of Death
takes years to perfect.

11:29.875 --> 11:31.500
Do you even know how to pick a lock?

11:32.583 --> 11:34.583
Something tells me he'll figure it out.

11:36.959 --> 11:38.542
Remote control locks.

11:39.792 --> 11:42.208
I'm just glad the great
Houdini isn't here to see this.

11:42.750 --> 11:43.625
Who?

11:43.709 --> 11:44.667
- Houdini.
- Who's Dini?

11:44.750 --> 11:46.000
- No, Houdini.
- That's what I said.

11:46.083 --> 11:47.917
- Hou-dini.
- Why you asking me? I never met the man.

11:48.000 --> 11:48.834
Who, Dini?

11:48.959 --> 11:50.750
- Yeah, that's the guy.
- That's it, I'm leaving.

11:50.834 --> 11:52.875
Remote control locks, cheesy nicknames...

11:52.959 --> 11:54.792
You guys are hacks like Blaze.
And you'll never know

11:54.875 --> 11:56.375
what it's like to be real magicians.

11:56.667 --> 11:57.959
Gah!

11:58.041 --> 11:59.542
I mean, Ta-da!

12:04.291 --> 12:05.792
Hold on, my good lad.

12:05.875 --> 12:07.583
I have a little something
for your troubles.

12:07.667 --> 12:08.959
It's really nothing.

12:10.125 --> 12:11.208
That's a blank piece of paper.

12:11.291 --> 12:12.625
I said it was nothing.

12:14.083 --> 12:17.083
Okay, here they come.
Just follow my lead and don't blow it.

12:18.542 --> 12:19.583
Brie!

12:23.417 --> 12:25.000
Preston!

12:29.333 --> 12:31.750
Yeah, Brie told me you were a character.

12:32.542 --> 12:33.500
All right, Rudolph.

12:33.583 --> 12:35.458
Let's see what you got.

12:37.291 --> 12:38.458
Remember the plan.

12:53.291 --> 12:55.250
A bear! There's a bear over there!

12:55.333 --> 12:56.834
A bear? Where?
A bear?

12:57.875 --> 12:59.291
Honey, quick. Hide behind the caddy.

13:02.083 --> 13:03.875
Oh, the bear's gone.

13:05.625 --> 13:08.667
My perfect drive must have
scared him away.

13:09.458 --> 13:10.667
Okay, who's next?

13:11.041 --> 13:13.208
I don't wanna be out here
if there's a bear in the woods.

13:13.667 --> 13:15.250
-
- Caddy, chase it away.

13:16.625 --> 13:18.834
Do it, or you're not getting paid.

13:21.750 --> 13:24.625
Ugh, I don't like being
around poor people.

13:25.583 --> 13:27.542
I mean, like, get some money.

13:28.041 --> 13:29.041
Am I right?

13:30.291 --> 13:31.542
All right, I'm up.

13:32.166 --> 13:34.208
Rudolph, toss me my...

13:34.709 --> 13:35.875
three wood.

13:43.583 --> 13:44.542
Look at that.

13:45.000 --> 13:46.542
Got stuck up in the pine tree.

13:47.834 --> 13:49.250
Don't worry, I'll get it out.

13:55.083 --> 13:56.000
Look at that.

13:56.083 --> 13:57.125
Two for two.

14:05.375 --> 14:06.458
What are the odds?

14:07.417 --> 14:09.166
Brie, Taylor, give me your bags.

14:14.834 --> 14:18.083
I just want to thank everyone for
coming to this sweet 16 party.

14:18.875 --> 14:21.792
And in case you're wondering...
it's hers, not mine.

14:25.458 --> 14:26.709
Anyway...

14:27.917 --> 14:29.792
We have a special performance.

14:29.875 --> 14:32.792
Please welcome to the stage, The Raisin!

14:32.917 --> 14:33.875
Raven.

14:33.959 --> 14:35.291
The Raven!

14:38.875 --> 14:40.875
Will he materialize out of thin air?

14:41.875 --> 14:43.625
Will he descend from the heavens?

14:44.417 --> 14:47.625
Will he... Oh, no, he's just gonna walk
right out on stage.

14:47.959 --> 14:49.250
That's so Raven.

14:51.375 --> 14:53.291
Good people of Tori's party,

14:54.458 --> 14:57.458
I'm gonna ask you to boycott
this afternoon's performance

14:57.542 --> 15:00.041
due to the fact that The Raven
doesn't know anything about magic,

15:00.125 --> 15:03.625
- and is an absolute fraud.
- That's it, you little fun sponge.

15:03.709 --> 15:04.667
You're coming with me.

15:04.750 --> 15:06.625
Aah! Ow! Ow!

15:07.917 --> 15:09.041
I give you,

15:09.125 --> 15:10.834
The Spikes of Death.

15:12.834 --> 15:14.458
Ooh! Ooh!

15:15.166 --> 15:17.458
Razor-sharp spikes hang from above.

15:19.625 --> 15:21.375
That's not the trick, Sophia.

15:23.750 --> 15:26.250
If I haven't freed myself
from these five carbine locks

15:26.291 --> 15:27.834
before the clock reaches zero,

15:28.792 --> 15:29.917
then I guess The Raven...

15:32.542 --> 15:34.000
- ...is out of time.
-

15:34.083 --> 15:37.208
This is seriously gonna be off the hinges.

15:49.166 --> 15:51.250
Nice putt, Rudy!

15:51.333 --> 15:52.667
I like you.

15:53.041 --> 15:56.458
How would you like me to sponsor you
for permanent membership here at the club?

15:56.542 --> 15:58.542
Wha...

15:58.959 --> 16:01.000
I never expected this.

16:01.875 --> 16:03.709
- I filled out an application.
- Oh.

16:03.792 --> 16:05.166
Initial here, here and here.

16:05.250 --> 16:06.875
Oh, you'll love it here.

16:07.417 --> 16:09.792
They do a really good
job of keeping out the...

16:11.083 --> 16:12.166
the riffraff.

16:13.959 --> 16:15.250
-
- No!

16:15.375 --> 16:17.250
Did you see that?

16:17.291 --> 16:19.125
Our caddy just sweat on my putter.

16:20.250 --> 16:21.875
Now, I'm going to have to buy a new one.

16:22.625 --> 16:24.125
It is coming out of your pay!

16:26.333 --> 16:27.834
What is wrong with you people?

16:28.375 --> 16:30.542
This whole round you have been
berating our caddy.

16:30.625 --> 16:33.041
And I am embarrassed to be
hanging out with you.

16:33.667 --> 16:35.041
You're embarrassed of me?

16:35.917 --> 16:37.792
There's something
you and your father should know.

16:38.583 --> 16:41.834
The reason why you haven't seen
my family around here is because...

16:43.375 --> 16:44.709
We lost all of our money.

16:48.667 --> 16:50.208
Yep, I'm poor.

16:50.291 --> 16:53.250
But you know what, I'd rather be poor
and a nice person

16:53.291 --> 16:54.917
than be rich and like you.

16:56.709 --> 16:58.458
Come on, Rudy. Let's go.

16:58.542 --> 17:00.792
Security, a poor girl has snuck
into our club!

17:00.875 --> 17:02.208
I say that we play through.

17:03.417 --> 17:06.125
He is not rich or my Uncle.
He's my boss at the dojo.

17:07.625 --> 17:08.792
Rudolph...

17:09.792 --> 17:11.834
So, apparently, you...

17:12.417 --> 17:14.125
are part of the riffraff.

17:15.333 --> 17:16.500
You'll have to leave.

17:18.083 --> 17:19.125
Fine.

17:19.792 --> 17:20.875
You know what, Taylor?

17:21.917 --> 17:22.917
You're right.

17:23.917 --> 17:24.875
I'm proud of you.

17:25.625 --> 17:26.875
I don't want to be here either.

17:28.125 --> 17:29.291
But,

17:29.417 --> 17:32.458
since I will not set eyes upon
these hallowed fairways ever again,

17:32.542 --> 17:33.959
surely you shan't deny me

17:34.041 --> 17:39.041
one final attempt to send that
dimpled spheroid on a last ride to glory.

17:40.208 --> 17:41.208
What?

17:41.291 --> 17:42.542
I wanna whack my ball!

17:51.709 --> 17:53.125
All right.

17:53.208 --> 17:54.583
Now we can leave.

17:57.959 --> 17:59.542
<i>♪ Kickin' it with you! ♪</i>

17:59.625 --> 18:03.542
Would you say the locks are real
and 100 percent impossible to escape from?

18:03.959 --> 18:05.834
Yes, yes I would.

18:05.917 --> 18:07.959
One hundred percent impossible
to escape from.

18:10.542 --> 18:11.709
And now...

18:12.000 --> 18:14.083
the moment we've all been waiting for.

18:14.291 --> 18:15.417
Cake!

18:17.041 --> 18:18.250
The Spikes of Death.

18:18.291 --> 18:19.500
Then, cake.

18:22.291 --> 18:24.083
I'll give you a couple
seconds to make it look good

18:24.166 --> 18:25.917
before I pop the locks
and wheel off the curtain.

18:26.166 --> 18:27.417
- Cool.
- Okay.

18:42.291 --> 18:43.542
Ladies and gentlemen,

18:43.625 --> 18:44.917
The Raven...

18:45.750 --> 18:47.291
- is free!
-

18:47.375 --> 18:49.709
No, raven's not free! Raven's stuck.

18:49.792 --> 18:51.291
The lock around my chest won't open.

18:51.667 --> 18:53.041
What?

18:55.875 --> 18:56.750
Holy

18:56.875 --> 18:58.041
smokes!

19:07.250 --> 19:08.834
Milton, get out of here. There's no time.

19:08.917 --> 19:10.500
- I can open it.
- But there's no key!

19:10.583 --> 19:12.208
I don't need one, I'm a magician.

19:13.375 --> 19:14.667
- Hurry!
-

19:35.250 --> 19:36.166
Milton,

19:36.250 --> 19:37.959
I can't believe it.
Dude, you saved my life.

19:38.500 --> 19:40.542
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
don't give him all the credit.

19:40.625 --> 19:42.875
He never could have saved you
if I hadn't put you in danger.

19:44.208 --> 19:45.417
You're welcome.

19:47.417 --> 19:49.250
How'd you learn how to pick
a lock with a hairpin?

19:49.583 --> 19:51.792
It was the summer of 2008.

19:51.875 --> 19:53.208
I was at friendship camp.

19:53.583 --> 19:54.750
Oh, so you're friends taught you?

19:54.834 --> 19:57.291
No, they locked me
in the equipment closet.

19:58.542 --> 19:59.750
I broke out with a hairpin.

19:59.834 --> 20:01.041
Wait, where'd you get a hairpin?

20:01.500 --> 20:05.000
It was also the summer I vowed
to tame my belligerent cowlick.

20:05.875 --> 20:06.959
Milton, you were right.

20:07.709 --> 20:10.000
Jerry and I were pretending
to be real magicians, but...

20:10.750 --> 20:11.625
- we're not.
-

20:12.166 --> 20:13.083
And you are.

20:13.875 --> 20:16.291
Hey, man, I hope there's no hard feelings
for going behind your back,

20:16.375 --> 20:17.959
betraying you and going out on our own.

20:19.417 --> 20:20.417
No, I'm fine.

20:20.500 --> 20:23.375
And in fact, you've inspired me to update
my act and add a little danger.

20:23.709 --> 20:24.917
Check this out.

20:29.542 --> 20:32.458
Uh, Milton, all you did was set
off a flash pot. Nothing happened.

20:32.959 --> 20:36.542
I call this trick "hungry rabbits
in backstabbers' pants."

20:37.917 --> 20:39.208
- That's dumb.
- Wait, what?

20:39.291 --> 20:40.959
- Why would you call it--
-

20:41.041 --> 20:42.166
Oh, okay.

20:42.291 --> 20:44.041
- Oh, wow.
- Where did the...

20:47.000 --> 20:48.125
Ta-da!

20:48.417 --> 20:49.750
Oh!

20:51.500 --> 20:53.041
<i>♪ Kickin' it with you! ♪</i>

20:58.667 --> 21:01.166
Look, man, if you're gonna stay
at my house there's a couple of rules.

21:01.750 --> 21:04.041
Okay, one, you can not swim
in the toilet bowl.

21:04.750 --> 21:08.166
And two, when we're at the dinner
table you can't regurgitate a trout

21:08.250 --> 21:09.625
into my mother's frijoles.

21:09.709 --> 21:11.041
It's not cool, dude.

21:13.291 --> 21:16.166
Well yeah, I may have done it first, but
this isn't about me. It's about you.

21:17.041 --> 21:19.375
Jerry, you look ridiculous
talking to a turtle.

21:19.750 --> 21:22.041
Says the nerd who
drops carrots into his pants.

21:24.041 --> 21:25.500
Hey, good one, Ronnie.

21:28.917 --> 21:29.875
Take your time.

21:57.041 --> 21:57.917
<i>Poor soul.</i>

22:01.875 --> 22:02.750
<i>Yes!</i>
