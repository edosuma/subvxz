WEBVTT

00:00.960 --> 00:03.431
My name is Ichabod Crane.
I was enlisted

00:03.461 --> 00:05.761
in the Queen's Royal Regiment
and sent to the

00:05.795 --> 00:07.496
American colonies
to fight the Patriots.

00:07.530 --> 00:09.832
It didn't take long for me
to have a change of heart.

00:09.866 --> 00:13.335
In 1781,
I died on the battlefield.

00:13.370 --> 00:15.237
But I was saved
by a mysterious spell

00:15.271 --> 00:18.173
cast upon me by
my beloved wife Katrina.

00:18.208 --> 00:20.642
Now I've been awakened
250 years later,

00:20.677 --> 00:24.680
and fate led me
to Miss Abigail Mills, a young

00:24.714 --> 00:28.017
police lieutenant investigating
baffling mysteries.

00:28.051 --> 00:30.019
Lieutenant Abbie Mills
to see Jennifer Mills.

00:30.053 --> 00:31.153
I'm her sister.

00:31.187 --> 00:32.788
I believe that we can

00:32.822 --> 00:35.824
work together to get some
answers, some real answers.

00:35.859 --> 00:38.327
CRANE: We are now bearing witness
to strange events and dark forces.

00:38.361 --> 00:40.662
They foretell that
our realm is in danger,

00:40.697 --> 00:43.132
and the Apocalypse
may be upon us.

00:43.166 --> 00:45.367
Revelation?
This speaks of two witnesses.

00:45.402 --> 00:46.835
You were called to something,
Abbie. We both were.

00:46.870 --> 00:49.271
KATRINA:
When you wounded the Horseman,

00:49.305 --> 00:51.440
your bloodlines merged.

00:51.474 --> 00:53.042
You became linked,
bound together by blood.

00:53.076 --> 00:55.310
It's the Horseman
who's been awakened, Ichabod...

00:55.345 --> 00:57.046
and you, along with him.

00:57.080 --> 00:58.247
CRANE:
Sleepy Hollow.

01:04.254 --> 01:05.521
Safe!

01:05.555 --> 01:08.390
What?! Are you
kidding me, dude?!

01:08.425 --> 01:09.892
Way to police the game.

01:09.926 --> 01:11.727
Yeah, that's right.
Blue, I'm a cop.

01:11.761 --> 01:14.029
I'm deputizing you.
Wake up!

01:14.064 --> 01:15.664
This is what you do

01:15.698 --> 01:17.066
to relax?

01:17.100 --> 01:19.034
It's cathartic.
It's baffling.

01:19.069 --> 01:21.036
I'd consider myself
a sporting man,

01:21.071 --> 01:23.472
but why must you
insult that gentleman

01:23.506 --> 01:25.007
for citing a rule infraction?

01:25.041 --> 01:26.542
I fail to see the point.

01:26.576 --> 01:29.011
What is the point of baseball?

01:29.045 --> 01:31.547
Oh, please enlighten me.
All right.

01:31.581 --> 01:33.415
For me, baseball's
about three things.

01:33.450 --> 01:35.884
First, tradition.
Rules never change.

01:35.919 --> 01:37.719
You can always count
on the grass

01:37.754 --> 01:40.155
to be green,
the lines to be white.

01:40.190 --> 01:41.657
So no matter how
crazy the world gets,

01:41.691 --> 01:44.526
it makes you feel safe,
like everything's okay.

01:44.561 --> 01:47.029
Second, it's about teamwork.

01:47.063 --> 01:48.397
The players have to have faith
in each other

01:48.431 --> 01:49.998
and watch each others' backs,

01:50.033 --> 01:51.834
because without that,
the team don't work.

01:51.868 --> 01:53.168
And what I love is that

01:53.203 --> 01:54.703
this sport does
not discriminate.

01:54.737 --> 01:58.340
You can be a short
long reliever, a long

01:58.374 --> 02:00.275
shortstop, black, white,

02:00.310 --> 02:01.610
Hispanic.

02:01.644 --> 02:03.712
And that is the American dream.

02:03.746 --> 02:06.615
So, it represents
the spirit of democracy.

02:06.649 --> 02:08.116
It's what you guys were
fighting for, right?

02:08.151 --> 02:10.551
Our pride, our link to the past.

02:10.586 --> 02:12.521
Created by the forefathers,

02:12.555 --> 02:15.090
handed down generation
to generation.

02:15.125 --> 02:17.426
That's why I scream at the ump.

02:18.828 --> 02:21.597
Open your eyes, sir!

02:21.631 --> 02:22.931
Yes, you.

02:22.966 --> 02:24.266
Basket face.

02:24.300 --> 02:25.634
I thought only horses

02:25.668 --> 02:27.402
slept standing up!

02:27.437 --> 02:29.605
(Abbie laughs)

02:29.639 --> 02:33.609
Good, feels good, exercise your
hard-fought right, free speech.

02:33.643 --> 02:36.044
Just next time, wait for the ump
to make a call.

02:36.079 --> 02:38.147
Right.

02:38.181 --> 02:40.649
I must say,

02:40.683 --> 02:42.317
I deeply enjoyed this
outing, Lieutenant.

02:42.352 --> 02:44.086
Ugh!

02:44.120 --> 02:47.222
For a brief moment, it felt
as though, I, too, were home.

02:47.257 --> 02:50.025
You are home, Crane.

02:51.961 --> 02:54.796
One day, I'll take you
to a Mets game.

02:54.831 --> 02:56.965
Bad beer, cold hot dogs.

02:57.000 --> 02:58.567
That'll really blow your mind.

02:58.601 --> 03:00.669
Whilst I noted several
indecipherable flourishes

03:00.703 --> 03:02.437
in that sentence,

03:02.472 --> 03:05.674
I look forward to you
expanding my horizons further.

03:05.708 --> 03:07.075
You sure you don't need a ride?

03:07.110 --> 03:09.011
No, thank you.

03:09.045 --> 03:11.580
I feel I'm beginning
to get my bearings around town,

03:11.614 --> 03:13.582
so I should like
to exercise my freedom

03:13.616 --> 03:15.450
with a stroll
and some fresh air.

03:15.485 --> 03:17.219
You do that.

03:19.956 --> 03:21.790
(chuckles)

03:21.824 --> 03:23.892
I'll see you tomorrow, Crane.

KATRINA:
Miss Mills, this way.

05:27.283 --> 05:29.918
(panting, bird screeching)

05:31.454 --> 05:33.855

05:59.882 --> 06:03.885
(distant laughter)

06:09.325 --> 06:11.827
Hello, Miss Mills.

06:14.831 --> 06:16.832
Who are you?

06:16.866 --> 06:18.300
I am Katrina Crane.

06:18.334 --> 06:19.801
And this house is an echo

06:19.836 --> 06:22.671
of the home I once shared
with my husband.

06:22.705 --> 06:24.473
What am I doing here?
This is a dream?

06:24.507 --> 06:27.509
It's a doorway in which I'm able
to reach those who bear witness.

06:27.543 --> 06:30.112
You and Ichabod.

06:30.146 --> 06:32.481
The Horseman you just saw

06:32.515 --> 06:34.783
is a manifestation
of what is to come.

06:34.817 --> 06:38.387
He will return
to Sleepy Hollow by nightfall.

06:38.421 --> 06:40.989
He can only be stopped
by the two witnesses.

06:41.023 --> 06:44.025
But I'm afraid Ichabod
has been abducted.

06:44.060 --> 06:45.494
What do you mean abducted?

06:45.528 --> 06:47.329
I was just with him.
Abducted by who?

06:47.363 --> 06:48.730
I do not know.
They've marked his surroundings

06:48.765 --> 06:50.132
with a protective shield

06:50.166 --> 06:51.166
to block my sight.

06:51.200 --> 06:53.368
That is why I have come to you.

06:53.403 --> 06:57.372
It can't be a mere coincidence
he was taken now.

06:57.407 --> 07:02.878
You think he was taken for
his blood tie with the Horseman?

07:02.912 --> 07:05.180
When I cast the spell
on Ichabod to save his life,

07:05.214 --> 07:08.650
I had no idea their fates
would become entwined.

07:08.684 --> 07:10.018
It seemed

07:10.052 --> 07:11.820
irreversible until now.

07:11.854 --> 07:13.555
You found a way?

07:13.589 --> 07:15.357
The Sin Eater.

07:15.391 --> 07:17.058
I don't understand.

07:17.093 --> 07:18.460
What's a Sin Eater?

07:21.898 --> 07:23.732
We are out of time.

07:23.766 --> 07:27.436
He will know how to guide you
to Ichabod and undo the spell.

07:27.470 --> 07:29.237
What do you mean, guide me? How?

07:29.272 --> 07:31.406
Ichabod must be sanctified.

07:31.441 --> 07:34.943
Find the Sin Eater
before sundown before

07:34.977 --> 07:37.012
the Horseman returns,
or everything

07:37.046 --> 07:38.613
will be lost!
Wait

07:38.648 --> 07:40.615
I don't understand.
(truck horn blaring)

07:40.650 --> 07:44.386
(tires squealing, horn blaring)

07:56.065 --> 07:58.832
ABBIE: What I'm about to tell
you is grounds to commit me.

07:58.867 --> 08:02.002
The thing that killed Corbin and
Reverend Knapp... the Horseman...

08:02.036 --> 08:04.004
Would that be
the Headless Horseman?

08:04.038 --> 08:07.841
Yes. He's coming back...
tonight.

08:07.876 --> 08:09.910
I have questions
if that's okay?

08:09.944 --> 08:12.546
The first one being,
how do you know?

08:12.580 --> 08:15.282
Crane's wife...
I believe he mentioned her...

08:15.316 --> 08:18.118
is some kind of witch.

08:18.153 --> 08:19.720
She visited me.

08:19.722 --> 08:21.221
Crane is linked to the Horseman.

08:21.256 --> 08:23.390
Their blood is mixed together,

08:23.424 --> 08:25.526
so now, their spirits
are connected.

08:25.560 --> 08:28.028
I'm gonna ask you
to clarify that.

08:28.062 --> 08:30.364
It means that we cannot hurt the
Horseman without hurting Crane.

08:30.398 --> 08:32.198
That's why they have
to be separated.

08:32.232 --> 08:34.433
His wife told me that
the only way to break the curse

08:34.469 --> 08:37.571
would be to find someone
called The Sin Eater.

08:37.605 --> 08:39.405
Now, who or whatever that is
apparently has the power

08:39.440 --> 08:42.476
to pull them apart so that
we can stop the Horseman

08:42.510 --> 08:44.278
permanently.

08:44.312 --> 08:48.282
You know,
there are two things in life

08:48.316 --> 08:51.318
I believe a person should hold
onto for as long as possible:

08:51.352 --> 08:54.922
Virginity and skepticism.

08:54.956 --> 08:57.558
Surprisingly, I already
lost the first thing,

08:57.592 --> 08:59.293
so I'm gonna hold
onto the second one

08:59.327 --> 09:00.928
for as long as possible.

09:00.962 --> 09:02.763
I know him. I know
he wouldn't just disappear.

09:02.797 --> 09:04.831
Now I could pretend
that this was just a bad

09:04.866 --> 09:08.268
hallucination and let whatever
is going to happen, happen.

09:08.303 --> 09:10.771
But that isn't me,

09:10.805 --> 09:12.806
and I know that isn't you.

09:15.677 --> 09:17.945
What do you need?

09:17.979 --> 09:20.614
To find the Sin Eater.
He'll lead me to Crane.

09:20.648 --> 09:24.084
Which leads me to my next big ask.
Let me guess.

09:24.118 --> 09:26.153
You're planning
a family reunion.

09:27.555 --> 09:29.790
(buzzer sounds)

09:35.730 --> 09:38.332
Well, look what
the cat dragged in.

09:38.366 --> 09:40.167
I got you a 24-hour furlough.

09:40.201 --> 09:41.535
Crane is in trouble.

09:41.569 --> 09:44.705
I need you to help me find him.

09:44.739 --> 09:47.641
You're a cop.
Go investigate.

09:47.675 --> 09:50.177
I am. You're my best lead,
and you know

09:50.211 --> 09:51.645
how important Crane is.

09:51.679 --> 09:53.880
To you?

09:53.915 --> 09:57.150
Yeah, to me... and to you.

09:57.185 --> 09:58.652
You said that

09:58.686 --> 10:01.154
you went around the world
looking for connections,

10:01.189 --> 10:03.357
for things
that nobody could explain,

10:03.391 --> 10:05.959
things that Corbin was trying
to help you understand.

10:05.994 --> 10:08.495
I'm hoping you'll know
about one of them.

10:08.529 --> 10:12.499
Have you ever heard of the term
Sin Eater?

10:13.735 --> 10:16.036
You're right.

10:16.070 --> 10:18.505
We better move fast.

10:41.729 --> 10:43.297
(footsteps approaching)

10:49.370 --> 10:53.440
Apologies for the less than
civil nature of your seizure.

10:53.474 --> 10:55.575
We didn't believe
you would come voluntarily.

10:55.610 --> 10:58.178
The effects of the tranquilizer
should be nearly gone.

10:58.212 --> 11:01.782
What am I doing here?

11:01.816 --> 11:03.717
Written on these pages

11:03.751 --> 11:06.119
is the true account

11:06.154 --> 11:07.688
of Ichabod Crane.

11:07.722 --> 11:08.889
An account by whom?

11:08.923 --> 11:10.390
We'll come to that.

11:10.425 --> 11:13.026
Will we now...

11:13.061 --> 11:15.028
Mr. Rutledge?

11:15.063 --> 11:17.931
Should've removed
your cufflinks, "J.R."

11:17.965 --> 11:20.233
Surname, Rutledge.

11:20.268 --> 11:22.436
The family resemblance
is too much to ignore.

11:22.470 --> 11:24.771
You're a descendent
of Edward Rutledge,

11:24.806 --> 11:27.274
the youngest signatory of the
Declaration of Independence.

11:27.308 --> 11:28.875
I knew him well.

11:28.910 --> 11:30.610
Here's what else
I know: your left palm

11:30.645 --> 11:33.780
is callused, suggesting
you work with your hands.

11:33.815 --> 11:36.583
Your right finger bears
discoloration in the shape

11:36.617 --> 11:38.051
of an inverted
square and compass,

11:38.086 --> 11:40.821
denoting a ring
that's been removed,

11:40.855 --> 11:43.824
for my benefit perhaps.

11:43.858 --> 11:45.492
Hexes to ward off evil,

11:45.526 --> 11:50.063
all telltale signs
of Freemasonry.

11:50.098 --> 11:52.332
You claim to be a fellow Mason?

11:52.367 --> 11:53.633
I am a Mason.

11:53.668 --> 11:55.001
Now,

11:55.036 --> 11:56.937
if we're on the same side,

11:56.971 --> 11:58.605
what am I doing here?

11:58.639 --> 12:00.273
You will live or die

12:00.308 --> 12:02.109
based on the truth
of your identity.

12:02.143 --> 12:03.810
I am Ichabod Crane.

12:03.845 --> 12:04.978
Perhaps.
I am.

12:05.012 --> 12:05.912
We've been fooled before.

12:05.947 --> 12:07.314
What does that mean?

12:07.348 --> 12:08.482
It means we're dealing
with forces

12:08.516 --> 12:09.916
beyond the power of man.

12:09.951 --> 12:12.152
Demons, shape-shifters.

12:12.186 --> 12:14.087
Tell me,

12:14.122 --> 12:16.256
when did you first hear
the words.

12:16.290 --> 12:21.261
"Ordo... Ab... Chao."

12:21.295 --> 12:23.663
(running footfalls)

12:26.067 --> 12:28.735
"Order from chaos."

12:31.339 --> 12:34.307
They were spoken to me
by a dying man.

12:34.342 --> 12:35.976
His name?

12:36.010 --> 12:38.445
Arthur Bernard.

12:38.479 --> 12:40.046
When I first heard of him,

12:40.081 --> 12:41.948
I fought for the British.

12:41.983 --> 12:44.484
We were sent to his
home to capture him.

12:44.519 --> 12:48.688
He was a freed slave
suspected of treason.

12:48.723 --> 12:51.024
Arthur Bernard,

12:51.058 --> 12:53.894
you are charged with
insurrection against the Crown

12:53.928 --> 12:57.664
for publication of this document
advocating American rebellion.

13:02.036 --> 13:05.172
The author on that pamphlet
reads "Cicero."

13:05.206 --> 13:07.808
A pseudonym, no doubt.

13:07.842 --> 13:09.409
You will be interrogated here

13:09.444 --> 13:11.645
until you reveal the identity

13:11.679 --> 13:14.381
of the treasonous criminal
known as Cicero.

13:14.415 --> 13:16.316
I know no such man.

13:16.350 --> 13:17.317
(grunts)

13:17.351 --> 13:18.885
I think you will find

13:18.920 --> 13:23.356
that the king's mercy
is without limit.

13:23.391 --> 13:24.724
Crane,

13:24.759 --> 13:26.760
come forth.

13:29.197 --> 13:31.231
Sir.
You come highly recommended

13:31.265 --> 13:33.233
to me, Lieutenant.

13:33.267 --> 13:36.203
I'm counting on you to coax
our prisoner into confession.

13:36.237 --> 13:39.573
Do this, and I'm giving you
a field commission as captain.

13:39.607 --> 13:41.608
As you wish, sir.

13:41.642 --> 13:43.043
Give him a chair.

13:43.077 --> 13:44.277
Shackle him.

13:46.147 --> 13:48.348
MAN:
Lieutenant, a nurse

13:48.382 --> 13:50.183
from the local Quaker community
requests an audience.

13:50.218 --> 13:51.818
Send her in.

13:57.959 --> 14:00.760
By what right do you hold
this man prisoner

14:00.795 --> 14:02.596
in his own home, sir?

14:02.630 --> 14:06.132
By Royal Assent of the King's
Quartering Act, madam.

14:06.167 --> 14:07.801
And his wounds?

14:07.835 --> 14:10.070
Did he offer resistance?

14:10.104 --> 14:11.638
He is charged with treason,

14:11.672 --> 14:13.907
a crime punishable
by utmost severity.

14:13.941 --> 14:16.543
I'm certain both sides
can agree on that.

14:16.577 --> 14:19.579
Wrong does not cease to be wrong
because the majority agrees.

14:19.614 --> 14:20.914
You fight for no country then?

14:20.948 --> 14:22.482
I am a Quaker, sir.

14:22.517 --> 14:26.486
I fight for the conviction
that every life is precious.

14:26.521 --> 14:30.056
Now I demand you to allow me
to treat his injury.

14:30.091 --> 14:31.791
BERNARD:
It's fine, my lady.

14:31.826 --> 14:33.527
I'm in good hands.

14:39.000 --> 14:41.134
Your eyes betray you,

14:41.168 --> 14:44.070
the inner voice that wants
to show him mercy.

14:44.105 --> 14:46.139
It's called a conscience.

14:52.179 --> 14:53.847
JENNY:
Every culture has

14:53.881 --> 14:55.782
their own version
of a Sin Eater,

14:55.816 --> 14:57.517
a person who has the power
to cleanse the wicked

14:57.552 --> 14:58.752
of their sins.

14:58.786 --> 14:59.986
It's like a priest?
Well,

15:00.021 --> 15:01.421
except they don't absolve you.

15:01.455 --> 15:03.757
A Sin Eater reaches
inside your soul

15:03.791 --> 15:07.093
and swallows your sins, ridding you of evil.
So how do we find one?

15:07.128 --> 15:10.630
Corbin doesn't seem
to have anything on them.

15:10.665 --> 15:12.032
Corbin was always searching
weird blogs

15:12.066 --> 15:13.366
or strange phenomena.

15:13.401 --> 15:15.802
He got me hooked.
There was this guy

15:15.836 --> 15:18.471
I was chasing for a while
who surfaced in...

15:18.506 --> 15:20.674
Algeria, Japan, Ghana.

15:20.708 --> 15:23.176
He visited death row
inmates before they died.

15:23.210 --> 15:25.612
Their last words? All the same.

15:25.646 --> 15:28.348
"I am sanctified."

15:29.417 --> 15:31.785
Ichabod must be sanctified.

15:31.819 --> 15:33.553
That's what Katrina said.

15:33.588 --> 15:36.122
Yeah, the problem is
he just stopped one day.

15:36.157 --> 15:37.724
Disappeared, like,
two years ago.

15:37.758 --> 15:39.059
No more sightings.

15:39.093 --> 15:40.327
I don't know why.

15:40.361 --> 15:42.062
I tried to figure it out, but...

15:42.096 --> 15:43.830
I lost track of him.

15:43.864 --> 15:45.865
Maybe because you were
working alone.

15:48.502 --> 15:49.402
(grunts)

15:49.437 --> 15:50.236
Enough!

15:50.271 --> 15:51.638
(panting)

15:51.672 --> 15:52.772
You're released.

15:54.041 --> 15:55.375
(door closes)

15:56.410 --> 15:58.812
Who is Cicero?

15:58.846 --> 16:00.647
I can offer you freedom

16:00.681 --> 16:03.550
in return for one name.
That's all we need from you.

16:03.584 --> 16:05.819
Would you sacrifice
the name of a man...

16:05.853 --> 16:07.988
one perhaps with a family...

16:08.022 --> 16:09.756
knowing that you
would be responsible

16:09.790 --> 16:12.058
for his death and their misery?

16:12.093 --> 16:13.860
My captain will not hesitate
to kill you.

16:13.894 --> 16:16.696
The love of power
is the demon of all men.

16:16.731 --> 16:18.865
And I'll let you
in on a secret.

16:18.899 --> 16:21.368
There are demons all around.

16:21.402 --> 16:23.169
Hiding as men among men,

16:23.204 --> 16:25.772
turning them
against one another.

16:25.806 --> 16:28.575
Join me against them.

16:28.609 --> 16:29.843
I'm afraid the interrogation

16:29.877 --> 16:31.444
has broken your grasp
of reality.

16:31.479 --> 16:32.746
Has it?

16:34.148 --> 16:36.049
RUTLEDGE:
You interrogated

16:36.083 --> 16:38.018
Arthur Bernard for days,

16:38.052 --> 16:40.387
without results.

16:40.421 --> 16:41.821
And then...

16:47.395 --> 16:50.597
CRANE: I was called away to stand
guard at a local execution.

16:55.503 --> 16:58.905
Three men were found guilty
of treason.

16:58.939 --> 17:01.908
Tarleton wanted to make
an example of them.

17:06.781 --> 17:09.249
(crowd murmuring quietly)

17:09.282 --> 17:10.517
(sobs)

17:25.700 --> 17:27.934
Colonel, with all due respect,

17:27.968 --> 17:29.302
I fear these public displays

17:29.336 --> 17:31.104
may not yield
the desired effect.

17:31.138 --> 17:32.939
You think leniency
is more likely

17:32.973 --> 17:34.507
to inspire loyalty
to the Crown?

17:34.542 --> 17:36.242
I feel it may prevent the birth

17:36.277 --> 17:38.511
of a new generation of
enemies, like that boy

17:38.546 --> 17:41.414
who's just witnessed
his father's hanging.

17:41.449 --> 17:44.851
Don't make me doubt
your loyalty, Crane.

17:44.885 --> 17:46.286
Or perhaps you'd feel better

17:46.320 --> 17:49.089
joining the next round
of traitors at the noose?

17:49.123 --> 17:52.959
I remain faithful, as always.

18:13.286 --> 18:14.787
(birds twittering)

18:17.324 --> 18:19.558
That was not my doing.

18:19.593 --> 18:22.261
That boy watched
his father die.

18:22.295 --> 18:23.696
Think you'll be forgiven

18:23.730 --> 18:26.365
just because you didn't
pull the lever?

18:26.400 --> 18:29.568
What I see...

18:29.603 --> 18:32.471
I'm afraid I don't
understand anymore.

18:32.506 --> 18:34.206
As I said...

18:34.241 --> 18:36.242
that is your conscience...

18:37.744 --> 18:39.745
revealing what you've
refused to see...

18:39.780 --> 18:41.814
until now.

18:41.848 --> 18:43.849
(sighs)

18:45.152 --> 18:47.753
We're from opposite worlds,
you and I.

18:47.788 --> 18:48.988
Strangers.

18:49.022 --> 18:51.824
And yet I have
the oddest sensation...

18:51.858 --> 18:53.626
That we've known each other
all along.

18:56.830 --> 18:58.898
I don't believe
in spirits, or destiny...

18:58.932 --> 19:00.666
You are a terrible liar, sir.

19:00.700 --> 19:04.036
It's quite endearing.

19:06.306 --> 19:08.340
Ichabod.

19:08.375 --> 19:09.742
Ichabod Crane.

19:09.776 --> 19:11.677
Katrina Van Tassel.

19:13.313 --> 19:16.182
And destiny isn't
a matter of chance,

19:16.216 --> 19:17.983
but of choice.

19:18.018 --> 19:20.619
And what you choose to accept

19:20.654 --> 19:23.189
will eventually become yours.

19:25.125 --> 19:27.226
So what is it that you saw?

19:29.563 --> 19:31.263
I've heard tales...

19:31.298 --> 19:32.865
of a secret war.

19:32.899 --> 19:35.201
Between men and...
Demons.

19:36.670 --> 19:39.038
You saw one.

19:39.072 --> 19:40.606
They were right,
you are the one.

19:40.640 --> 19:42.608
Who was right?

19:42.642 --> 19:44.043
How do you know this?

19:44.077 --> 19:45.978
You possess a gift,

19:46.012 --> 19:47.713
the power to bear witness.

19:47.747 --> 19:49.882
Do you realize what it means?

19:49.916 --> 19:52.384
How valuable you are
in this fight?

19:52.419 --> 19:53.953
We need you.

19:53.987 --> 19:55.554
Who are you?

19:58.692 --> 20:01.494
Like you, someone who seeks
the truth above all else.

20:03.263 --> 20:04.663
(whispering):
Evil gains its strength

20:04.698 --> 20:06.799
when good men do nothing.

20:06.833 --> 20:08.267
You are a good man,
Ichabod Crane.

20:14.608 --> 20:16.809
JENNY: This Sin Eater
knows how to hide.

20:16.843 --> 20:19.144
Cross-referenced every death row

20:19.179 --> 20:20.379
visitor's log.

20:20.413 --> 20:22.014
No name shows up twice.

20:22.048 --> 20:23.816
He's gotta have a name.

20:23.850 --> 20:27.052
No one walks into a max security
prison without authorization.

20:28.855 --> 20:30.489
(sighs)

20:30.524 --> 20:32.358
You really care about this guy.

20:32.392 --> 20:34.593
About Crane.

20:34.628 --> 20:35.861
Remember how Mom used

20:35.896 --> 20:37.763
to take us to that...
rug store?

20:37.797 --> 20:39.164
They had those extra pieces,

20:39.199 --> 20:40.432
the parts of the rug

20:40.467 --> 20:42.268
that didn't really
fit anywhere.

20:42.302 --> 20:44.370
I always kind of felt like
that was you and me.

20:44.404 --> 20:45.704
You know?

20:45.739 --> 20:47.673
The remainders.

20:47.707 --> 20:51.210
Two girls holding
onto each other so tight

20:51.244 --> 20:54.213
because we really did not fit
anywhere else.

20:56.917 --> 20:58.384
Then I lost you.

20:58.418 --> 21:00.386
And I felt real alone
for a long time,

21:00.420 --> 21:01.687
till Corbin.

21:01.721 --> 21:03.188
Then I lost him, too...

21:03.223 --> 21:07.059
except at almost
that same moment,

21:07.093 --> 21:09.061
Crane came into my life.

21:09.095 --> 21:11.797
And I guess he
made me feel like,

21:11.831 --> 21:13.065
for the first time,

21:13.099 --> 21:14.567
I had a purpose
that I understood.

21:14.601 --> 21:17.436
And someone...

21:17.470 --> 21:19.905
who I was supposed
to find it with.

21:21.741 --> 21:23.809
Anyway...

21:23.843 --> 21:25.144
Well, the next time

21:25.178 --> 21:26.545
you see that witch in a dream,

21:26.580 --> 21:28.581
tell her to be more specific.

21:28.615 --> 21:30.583
I mean, her husband's
about to be a dead man.

21:39.526 --> 21:41.527
What?

21:43.630 --> 21:45.531
Abbie, you gonna invite me
to the party?

21:52.872 --> 21:54.106
He's a dead man.

21:54.140 --> 21:56.075
James Turcotte,
the death row inmate

21:56.109 --> 21:57.776
from Huntsville, Texas.

21:57.811 --> 21:59.011
His name shows up

21:59.045 --> 22:01.280
on this death row inmate's log.

22:01.314 --> 22:02.514
San Quentin

22:02.549 --> 22:03.816
the following year.
He takes on

22:03.850 --> 22:05.317
the identity of dead inmates.

22:05.352 --> 22:06.685
That's how he hides.

22:06.720 --> 22:08.020
Not anymore.

22:08.054 --> 22:09.655
We have the last name
that he used.

22:09.689 --> 22:12.358
Ian Kellett.

22:12.392 --> 22:15.461
ABBIE: Last listing as a resident
in Hartford, Connecticut.

22:15.495 --> 22:18.464
♪

22:23.069 --> 22:25.137
(knocking)

22:25.171 --> 22:27.272
This is Lieutenant Abbie Mills

22:27.307 --> 22:29.008
with the Sleepy Hollow
Sheriff's Department.

22:29.042 --> 22:30.976
I'd like to talk to you.

22:31.011 --> 22:32.378
(muffled footsteps)

22:34.514 --> 22:35.781
Sir, I can hear you in there.

22:35.815 --> 22:37.716
I have a warrant
to search the premises.

22:37.751 --> 22:40.219
I need you
to open this door now.

22:40.253 --> 22:41.487
(quietly):
We don't have a warrant.

22:41.521 --> 22:43.188
How is he gonna know?

22:43.223 --> 22:44.790
(door opens)

22:44.824 --> 22:46.392
(door creaks)

22:47.661 --> 22:49.094
(softly):
What's this about?

22:52.499 --> 22:54.733
This is about Ian Kellett.

22:54.768 --> 22:56.802
A dead man whose
ID number you used

22:56.836 --> 22:58.237
to rent this apartment.

22:58.271 --> 23:00.673
We know your real name,
Henry Parrish.

23:00.707 --> 23:02.341
You committed identity theft.

23:02.375 --> 23:04.143
You could be facing
some real time,

23:04.177 --> 23:06.945
or you could open the door
and we could talk.

23:10.016 --> 23:11.350
(locks clicking)

23:11.384 --> 23:13.585
(door creaking)

23:22.228 --> 23:24.196
(door closes)

23:24.230 --> 23:25.998
Mr. Parrish,

23:26.032 --> 23:27.666
I know who you are,

23:27.701 --> 23:29.268
what you are.

23:29.302 --> 23:30.769
My friend

23:30.804 --> 23:32.504
is missing...
I need your help.

23:32.539 --> 23:34.740
People always do.

23:36.443 --> 23:38.977
I don't do it anymore.

23:40.880 --> 23:43.549
Even if I explained,
you wouldn't understand.

23:43.583 --> 23:44.983
Try me.

23:52.559 --> 23:57.229
Imagine you had a pair
of glasses...

23:57.263 --> 23:58.464
that could see people...

23:58.498 --> 23:59.765
see through them.

23:59.799 --> 24:02.534
Into their hearts;

24:02.569 --> 24:04.369
What they've done.

24:04.404 --> 24:10.209
The parts that are
locked down so deep,

24:10.243 --> 24:12.411
even they're afraid to see.

24:12.445 --> 24:14.413
But you see them.

24:14.447 --> 24:16.615
And you carried them.

24:16.649 --> 24:20.786
Until the only person
you can't see anymore...

24:20.820 --> 24:22.755
is yourself.

24:23.957 --> 24:26.058
If I didn't stop...

24:26.092 --> 24:28.927
I would have
disappeared completely.

24:30.463 --> 24:31.930
We know what it's like

24:31.965 --> 24:34.299
to live with something
that no one else has.

24:34.334 --> 24:35.901
No matter what it feels like...

24:35.935 --> 24:38.103
it's a gift.

24:38.138 --> 24:40.005
You have a responsibility...

24:40.039 --> 24:41.774
whether you like it or not.

24:41.808 --> 24:45.811
"Let he who is without sin."

24:45.845 --> 24:49.448
I'm fairly certain
that isn't you.

24:50.617 --> 24:52.818
You want to get biblical?

24:52.852 --> 24:56.789
"I looked, and there before me
was a pale horse.

24:56.823 --> 24:59.324
"Its rider's name was Death,

24:59.359 --> 25:01.794
and Hell followed with him."

25:01.828 --> 25:03.762
Revelation.

25:03.797 --> 25:06.465
The first of the Four Horsemen.

25:06.499 --> 25:08.333
Thing of it is,
he's connected to my friend.

25:08.368 --> 25:10.002
Death?
Yes.

25:10.036 --> 25:12.037
Connected to your friend how?

25:12.071 --> 25:13.105
A curse.

25:13.139 --> 25:14.706
A blood tie...

25:14.741 --> 25:17.843
linking their spirits together.

25:17.877 --> 25:20.846
And you want me
to break the curse...

25:20.880 --> 25:23.015
to separate the Horseman
from your friend.

25:23.049 --> 25:24.449
According to the Bible,

25:24.484 --> 25:28.854
a sin is a transgression
of divine law.

25:28.888 --> 25:31.957
That is what the Horseman is,
an abomination,

25:31.991 --> 25:34.326
walking force; pure sin.

25:34.360 --> 25:36.829
You have the power
to pull him out.

25:36.863 --> 25:38.697
Where is your friend now?

25:38.731 --> 25:41.099
I was told you could tell me.

25:42.535 --> 25:44.203
Maybe.

25:44.237 --> 25:48.240
If your connection with your
friend is strong enough,

25:48.274 --> 25:49.708
I could use it.

25:49.742 --> 25:51.109
It's strong.

25:52.212 --> 25:53.879
Use it.

25:58.585 --> 26:00.485
Like I said,
I don't do it anymore.

26:00.520 --> 26:01.553
You should go.

26:01.588 --> 26:03.622
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute!

26:07.260 --> 26:08.794
(gasps) Abbie!

26:11.297 --> 26:14.833
Your friend... is underground.

26:14.868 --> 26:16.368
Behind a door marked

26:16.402 --> 26:18.036
with a symbol;

26:18.071 --> 26:21.874
A square and a compass.

26:25.144 --> 26:27.346
That's the symbol
of the Freemasons.

26:27.380 --> 26:28.947
Underground, was it a tunnel?

26:28.982 --> 26:31.550
I've told you what you needed
to know to find him.

26:31.584 --> 26:34.786
That's all I can do
for you. Please leave.

26:44.109 --> 26:46.540
JENNY: I had no idea these tunnels
were under the town.

26:46.578 --> 26:50.246
ABBIE: Crane showed them to me.
Lot of secrets down here.

26:50.280 --> 26:53.516
Parrish said the door
had a compass and square.

26:53.550 --> 26:54.850
You sure that's
the Freemason symbol?

26:54.885 --> 26:59.188
Like, secret societies,
animal sacrifices?

26:59.223 --> 27:01.157
I'm pretty sure
that part's a myth.

27:01.191 --> 27:03.693
Templar Knights,
the Founding Fathers...

27:03.727 --> 27:05.294
they're the good guys.

27:05.329 --> 27:08.531
If they're the good guys,
why do they have Crane?

27:10.167 --> 27:11.767
CRANE: When I returned
to the interrogation

27:11.802 --> 27:13.936
at Arthur Bernard's,
everything had changed.

27:13.971 --> 27:16.639
My sins were about
to be revealed.

27:16.673 --> 27:18.274
(floorboards creaking)

27:18.308 --> 27:19.775
(thunder crashes)

27:19.810 --> 27:21.277
And where were you?

27:21.311 --> 27:24.780
I'm here to continue
the interrogations.

27:24.815 --> 27:28.150
The time has passed,
and you have failed.

27:28.185 --> 27:31.887
I shall grant you one path
to redemption.

27:31.922 --> 27:34.824
One path only:

27:34.858 --> 27:36.826
Take this man into the forest,

27:36.860 --> 27:40.296
where he will die
like the animal he is.

27:40.330 --> 27:42.164
(thunder crashing)

27:52.776 --> 27:54.143
BERNARD:
The woman was right.

27:54.177 --> 27:56.879
Katrina. You are invaluable
to the cause.

27:56.913 --> 28:00.383
And what would
you have me do, huh?

28:00.417 --> 28:03.152
Betray my country,
my family, my home?

28:03.186 --> 28:05.254
For what?
For the unknown?

28:05.289 --> 28:06.922
Some sacrifices
are worth making.

28:06.957 --> 28:08.391
And if you pull that trigger,

28:08.425 --> 28:10.559
you will carry sin inside
your heart forever.

28:10.594 --> 28:12.161
You'll invite evil
to live inside you

28:12.195 --> 28:14.063
till you beg for salvation.

28:14.097 --> 28:17.066
That is what I'm offering you,
what she's offering you.

28:17.100 --> 28:18.868
How would you know
what she's offering?

28:18.902 --> 28:22.972
Pull the trigger, and
you'll never find out.

28:26.076 --> 28:27.543
March.

28:36.086 --> 28:37.787
(thunder crashing)

28:51.568 --> 28:54.603
The life you knew
will never return.

28:54.638 --> 28:57.740
You are Cicero...

28:57.774 --> 28:59.275
aren't you?

28:59.309 --> 29:01.277
He is all of us.

29:02.646 --> 29:04.046
Find Katrina.

29:04.081 --> 29:06.315
She will guide you
to Commander Washington.

29:06.350 --> 29:08.184
And I suspect much more.

29:10.587 --> 29:12.588
Ordo Ab Chao.
"Order from chaos."

29:12.622 --> 29:14.623
Speak these words to her.

29:14.658 --> 29:16.859
She will know which side
your heart has chosen.

29:18.462 --> 29:20.963
I will find you again,
my friend.

29:25.001 --> 29:26.469
(gunshot)

29:26.503 --> 29:28.637
No!

29:30.040 --> 29:31.307
Traitor!

29:35.278 --> 29:36.812
(groans)

29:36.847 --> 29:38.881
(thunder crashing)

29:48.191 --> 29:49.825
(roars)

30:07.844 --> 30:10.246
♪

30:30.033 --> 30:31.734
(gasps)

30:33.370 --> 30:34.804
Ordo...

30:34.838 --> 30:36.839
Ab... Chao.

30:38.175 --> 30:39.875
(groans)

30:50.887 --> 30:53.355
I couldn't save him.

30:55.292 --> 30:57.726
Had I acted sooner,
he would have lived.

30:59.095 --> 31:01.096
This is my sin...

31:01.131 --> 31:04.567
and I must bear it all my days.

31:16.813 --> 31:18.981
Brother Ichabod Crane...

31:20.484 --> 31:23.552
we are humbled
to be in your presence...

31:23.587 --> 31:26.755
and we offer you our trust.

31:31.595 --> 31:34.797
If this ledger confirms
my account,

31:34.831 --> 31:37.766
and I didn't write it...
who did?

31:37.801 --> 31:39.068
Katrina.

31:40.837 --> 31:42.771
She was your ally.

31:42.806 --> 31:44.940
For a while,
her coven was in league

31:44.975 --> 31:47.643
with our Mason forefathers,
until she betrayed their trust.

31:47.677 --> 31:48.944
How?

31:48.979 --> 31:50.412
By secreting you away

31:50.447 --> 31:53.315
from wherever you were buried
these centuries...

31:53.350 --> 31:55.618
someplace we could not find.

31:57.354 --> 31:59.989
The Masons...

32:00.023 --> 32:03.659
my brothers wanted me dead.

32:04.861 --> 32:06.228
That's why Katrina hid me...

32:06.263 --> 32:07.496
she was protecting me.

32:07.531 --> 32:10.332
At the expense
of the greater good.

32:10.367 --> 32:14.670
She knew the inevitable outcome
of your tie to the Horseman.

32:14.704 --> 32:19.275
Regretfully, a fate we would've
sealed for you long ago...

32:19.309 --> 32:23.979
and one that we have no choice
but to seal for you now.

32:29.786 --> 32:32.321
That's why you had me tell
Bernard's story.

32:32.355 --> 32:34.990
He died for the greater good.

32:35.025 --> 32:36.458
In Arthur Bernard,
you witnessed a man

32:36.493 --> 32:39.161
willing to make
the ultimate sacrifice.

32:40.363 --> 32:42.197
Inside this box is the only way

32:42.232 --> 32:45.968
to assure
The Horseman's reign ends...

32:46.002 --> 32:47.303
forever.

32:47.337 --> 32:51.240
You know what
you must do, Brother Crane.

33:02.799 --> 33:05.000
The square and compass.

33:06.169 --> 33:09.171
Drop your weapon.

33:09.205 --> 33:10.539
That's not how
this is gonna work.

33:10.573 --> 33:12.508
I'm a police officer.

33:12.542 --> 33:14.810
Let us in, or we call

33:14.844 --> 33:16.879
in the damn cavalry.

33:23.353 --> 33:25.688
Crane.

33:25.722 --> 33:26.989
Miss Mills.

33:27.023 --> 33:29.291
Don't be alarmed, please.

33:29.326 --> 33:31.493
These men are my brothers.
Your brothers?

33:31.528 --> 33:32.695
You're a Mason?

33:32.729 --> 33:35.164
What the hell is happening?

33:35.198 --> 33:37.466
He will not be hurt by our hand.

33:37.500 --> 33:38.701
I want him out of here now!

33:38.735 --> 33:39.802
CRANE:
No. Please.

33:39.836 --> 33:42.705
Allow me to explain.

33:42.739 --> 33:44.006
Would you excuse us?

33:44.040 --> 33:45.908
Of course.

33:48.611 --> 33:51.647
What is that?

33:51.681 --> 33:55.751
The Masons have been
tracking the Horseman.

33:55.785 --> 33:57.886
With his arrival, the threat
of the Apocalypse draws closer.

33:57.921 --> 34:02.758
I stopped him before...
temporarily.

34:02.792 --> 34:05.394
Now I can finish
what I started.

34:05.428 --> 34:06.895
My life is tied

34:06.930 --> 34:09.764
to the Horseman's,
and his to mine.

34:09.799 --> 34:11.567
When he rose, I rose.

34:11.601 --> 34:15.704
Therefore...
if I die, he dies.

34:15.739 --> 34:16.705
No.

34:16.739 --> 34:17.739
To ensure he never rides again,

34:17.774 --> 34:19.408
my life must end.

34:20.476 --> 34:22.110
It's the only way.

34:22.145 --> 34:23.746
No!

34:23.780 --> 34:25.414
I am not letting this happen.

34:25.447 --> 34:28.449
I swore an oath to sacrifice
my life if necessary

34:28.485 --> 34:29.784
so others may live freely,

34:29.819 --> 34:31.186
a lesson I learned

34:31.221 --> 34:32.855
from someone
who did the same for me.

34:32.889 --> 34:35.023
I know a man who can help,

34:35.058 --> 34:37.793
someone who can separate you
from the Horseman.

34:37.827 --> 34:40.396
Katrina searched and failed.

34:40.429 --> 34:42.297
Katrina's the one
who told me about him.

34:42.331 --> 34:44.466
Katrina came to you?

34:45.635 --> 34:46.935
Who is this man?

34:46.969 --> 34:48.937
Sin Eater.
It's a long story.

34:48.972 --> 34:50.539
But he wasn't exactly
cooperative,

34:50.572 --> 34:52.274
so I'm gonna bring you to him.

34:53.976 --> 34:56.078
There isn't time.

34:56.112 --> 34:58.213
The Horseman's nearly here.

34:58.248 --> 34:59.648
And even
if we could be decoupled,

34:59.682 --> 35:01.950
I'd only free him
to continue his rampage.

35:01.985 --> 35:04.887
This assures that he won't.

35:04.921 --> 35:07.623
I do not accept that, Crane!

35:07.657 --> 35:11.126
You must, if you accept what
we've been chosen to do...

35:11.161 --> 35:16.498
to avert the Apocalypse
so humanity can endure,

35:16.533 --> 35:19.501
so people can choose
their own destinies,

35:19.536 --> 35:22.104
just as I must now choose mine.

35:22.138 --> 35:25.140
There's another way.
There's always another way.

35:25.175 --> 35:27.776
Abbie...

35:27.811 --> 35:30.212
this is the only way.

35:32.115 --> 35:34.349
That's the first time
you ever called me Abbie.

35:40.623 --> 35:43.258
I've lived on borrowed time

35:43.293 --> 35:45.527
more than any man deserves.

35:45.562 --> 35:47.296
I've seen wonders

35:47.330 --> 35:50.666
beyond my wildest imaginings.

35:52.502 --> 35:55.304
And through these centuries,

35:55.338 --> 35:57.372
against the impossibility

35:57.407 --> 35:59.374
that we would find each other...

36:00.844 --> 36:03.545
we did.

36:05.048 --> 36:06.982
And I am most grateful for it.

36:07.016 --> 36:10.052
How can you be
so calm about this?

36:10.086 --> 36:13.755
I'm terrified.

36:29.839 --> 36:33.542
Perhaps it would be easier
if you left.

36:33.576 --> 36:36.178
There's no way.

36:36.212 --> 36:37.746
Too many people

36:37.780 --> 36:40.415
I never got a chance
to say good-bye to.

36:42.886 --> 36:45.287
You are not gonna be
one of them.

36:48.925 --> 36:51.360
(sighs)

37:04.140 --> 37:06.575
I'm so sorry.

37:11.640 --> 37:14.141
ABBIE (distorted, distant):
Crane? Stay with me.

37:14.176 --> 37:15.643
Ichabod, please,
stay with me. Please.

37:15.677 --> 37:17.478
Ichabod, no.

37:17.512 --> 37:19.146
Please stay with me.

37:19.181 --> 37:21.849
(heart beating)

37:21.883 --> 37:23.651
MAN: I wasn't sure
I'd make it in time.

37:23.685 --> 37:25.152
He doesn't have to die.

37:25.187 --> 37:27.254
MAN 2:
What do you mean?

37:27.289 --> 37:28.689
Not yet!

37:31.426 --> 37:33.093
He's almost gone.

37:33.128 --> 37:34.261
Clear the room, all of you.

37:34.296 --> 37:35.729
Thank you.

37:35.764 --> 37:38.232
Everyone out now!
This had better work.

37:38.266 --> 37:40.100
Who are you?

37:40.135 --> 37:42.536
I have been called many things.

37:42.571 --> 37:44.505
Angel.

37:44.539 --> 37:45.573
Demon.

37:45.607 --> 37:47.208
Until now,

37:47.242 --> 37:50.744
I wasn't sure what was true.

37:50.779 --> 37:52.246
For so long,

37:52.280 --> 37:54.882
I've hoped for this day.

37:54.916 --> 37:58.018
To find the reason
for what I've been given.

37:58.053 --> 37:59.954
And now I know.

37:59.988 --> 38:02.690
The reason is you.

38:02.724 --> 38:06.260
You're the man
Abbie told me about.

38:06.294 --> 38:08.896
The one Katrina sent her
to find.

38:08.930 --> 38:11.298
I've bought you a few moments

38:11.333 --> 38:14.201
before the poison stops
your heart.

38:14.236 --> 38:15.703
I can remove it!

38:15.737 --> 38:18.138
Along with your sins
if we're lucky.

38:19.441 --> 38:22.409
Put your hand on the table.

38:25.080 --> 38:27.448
(winces)

38:36.992 --> 38:38.192
(grunts)

38:43.331 --> 38:45.099
Yes.

38:45.133 --> 38:47.668
He is in there.

38:47.702 --> 38:49.603
As long as you carry

38:49.638 --> 38:52.806
your sin in your heart,

38:52.841 --> 38:55.109
it allows the Horseman

38:55.143 --> 38:57.111
to be tied to you.

38:57.145 --> 38:59.813
Someone once told me
that before.

38:59.848 --> 39:00.848
Who?

39:00.882 --> 39:02.349
The man I sinned against.

39:02.384 --> 39:05.152
Whose life I couldn't save.

39:05.186 --> 39:06.253
His name.

39:06.288 --> 39:07.788
Say it out loud.

39:07.822 --> 39:10.424
Arthur Bernard.

39:10.458 --> 39:12.159
Now summon him!

39:12.193 --> 39:14.128
With all your heart.

39:14.162 --> 39:15.195
Here!

39:15.230 --> 39:17.665
Into this room.

39:20.669 --> 39:23.237
Now open your eyes.

39:26.708 --> 39:30.177
I told you
I'll find you again, my friend.

39:30.211 --> 39:32.946
I don't understand.

39:32.981 --> 39:35.616
I did everything
you asked of me.

39:35.650 --> 39:38.786
I broke every vow
I took to my country.

39:38.820 --> 39:41.822
I betrayed my own blood.

39:41.856 --> 39:44.158
And yet you died anyway.

39:44.192 --> 39:46.527
What more would you have done?

39:46.561 --> 39:48.295
Freed you sooner so you'd live.

39:48.330 --> 39:50.297
And if I had?

39:50.332 --> 39:52.399
Would you have found
your destiny?

39:52.434 --> 39:55.002
Found your way
to your true home?

39:55.036 --> 39:56.970
Your death is on my soul.
No.

39:57.005 --> 39:59.173
My death saved your soul.

39:59.207 --> 40:01.308
Only you chose
to see it as a sin.

40:01.343 --> 40:03.811
When all along,
it was your salvation.

40:03.845 --> 40:05.813
What would you have me do?

40:05.847 --> 40:07.481
Forgive yourself.

40:07.515 --> 40:09.883
The Horseman feeds
on your regret.

40:09.918 --> 40:11.685
That is what fuels
your blood tie to him.

40:11.720 --> 40:14.355
Let it go,

40:14.389 --> 40:16.824
and his hold over you
will be broken.

40:16.858 --> 40:18.692
No, I'd only free him
so he could ride again.

40:18.727 --> 40:20.894
You'd only free yourself
to stop him.

40:20.929 --> 40:23.230
And the others
that ride with him.

40:23.264 --> 40:25.065
But you won't do it alone.

40:25.100 --> 40:27.101
Abbie.
Together

40:27.135 --> 40:30.671
your combined power will weather
the coming storm.

40:30.705 --> 40:32.873
Now do you understand?

40:32.907 --> 40:35.275
I do.

40:35.310 --> 40:38.178
Then repeat these words.

40:38.213 --> 40:41.014
I purge the wicked
from my blood.

40:41.049 --> 40:43.050
I purge the wicked
from my blood.

40:45.420 --> 40:46.887
Our spirits severed.

40:46.921 --> 40:48.155
Our spirits severed.

40:49.124 --> 40:50.691
My soul sanctified.

40:50.725 --> 40:52.092
My soul sanctified.

40:53.595 --> 40:54.895
Death, leave me now.

40:54.929 --> 40:56.463
Death, leave me now.

40:59.334 --> 41:00.534
I command you.

41:00.568 --> 41:02.403
I command you.

41:33.835 --> 41:35.502
(wind howling)

41:38.840 --> 41:40.774
(wind stops)

41:40.809 --> 41:43.277
I feel him no more.

41:46.314 --> 41:47.648
He's gone.

41:47.682 --> 41:49.383
He is sanctified.

41:56.858 --> 41:58.091
You were right.

41:58.126 --> 42:00.294
There's always another way.

42:00.328 --> 42:02.663
Next time, listen to me.

42:02.697 --> 42:03.831
Okay?

42:03.865 --> 42:06.266
I can't go through that again.

42:06.301 --> 42:09.770
My ears shall remain eternally
open to your admonition.

42:09.804 --> 42:11.538
I don't know
what the hell that means.

42:11.573 --> 42:13.006
Just say yes.

42:13.041 --> 42:14.508
Yes.

42:23.818 --> 42:25.152
The sun has set.

42:26.688 --> 42:28.055
He's awakened, I can feel it.

42:28.089 --> 42:29.122
The Horseman rides.

42:29.157 --> 42:30.457
He'll come for you.

42:30.492 --> 42:31.825
We must prepare.

42:31.860 --> 42:33.260
We'll be ready.
