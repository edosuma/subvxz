Yes!

00:46.333 --> 00:48.033
I said, "You're not very chatty."

do you think your parents

will be cool with it?

01:36.675 --> 01:38.508
It'll take a little bit of coaxing,

01:38.510 --> 01:40.677

01:40.679 --> 01:43.113

She didn't make it sound
like I'm genuinely happy,

03:33.134 --> 03:36.168
more like I'm happy because I'm too dumb

No, Tamara. It's not menopause.

07:36.439 --> 07:38.001
Why did you break up?

07:39.931 --> 07:41.172
Well, first he dumped me for Jenna.

07:41.197 --> 07:43.777
- That is shocking.
- I know, right?

07:43.802 --> 07:45.772
But more recently, I
broke up with him because

16:41.062 --> 16:42.896
Your name came up a lot tonight.

16:42.897 --> 16:44.830
Lizzy likes your writing.
She thinks you're ballsy.

16:44.832 --> 16:46.058
And it's been torture not to say,

16:46.083 --> 16:49.684
"I know. That hot, ballsy
writer is my girlfriend."

16:49.699 --> 16:51.887
But I want the world, including Lizzy,

16:52.702 --> 16:54.268
to know I love you.

16:54.270 --> 16:57.472
[chuckles]

16:57.474 --> 16:59.807
[knock at door]

17:03.042 --> 17:05.510
Oh, <i>guten Abend,</i> jerk.

17:05.535 --> 17:08.403
Lacey, I am so sorry
about the presentation.

17:08.405 --> 17:10.805
My night with Sully got
a little out of hand.

17:10.807 --> 17:12.462
I honestly did practice.

17:12.487 --> 17:13.675
Come on, I thought we were friends.

17:13.676 --> 17:16.127
Friends don't ruin friends'
chances of getting an A.

17:16.152 --> 17:17.268
What happened?

17:17.292 --> 17:20.486
Sully thought of this
drinking game for studying,

17:20.511 --> 17:22.198
and the next thing I knew,

17:22.722 --> 17:24.496
I woke up, and I missed it.

17:24.915 --> 17:26.214
Time for some real talk.

17:26.217 --> 17:30.185
Sully sounds like a whole lot of fun.

17:30.187 --> 17:32.087
You know, she actually reminds me

17:32.089 --> 17:35.390
of a friend I had who helped
an ex study for the LSATs,

17:35.392 --> 17:38.026
except he didn't wind
up going to law school.

17:38.028 --> 17:39.581
He went to rehab,

17:39.606 --> 17:41.606
and you know who that friend was?

17:41.804 --> 17:43.397
Ally.

17:44.535 --> 17:48.904
I love her to death,
but she is bad news,

17:48.906 --> 17:50.505
and so is Sully.

17:50.507 --> 17:52.946
I'll see you in class.

17:54.066 --> 17:56.967
<i>I was so excited that
Luke said he loved me</i>

17:56.969 --> 17:59.527
<i>that I decided to make
my own grand gesture.</i>

17:59.543 --> 18:01.442
<i>I had proven myself at Idea Bin,</i>

18:01.444 --> 18:04.045
<i>and neither of us wanted
to hide the truth anymore.</i>

18:04.046 --> 18:07.781
<i>And lucky me, I knew just
how to spread the word.</i>

18:14.282 --> 18:15.882
[tapping on glass]

18:18.630 --> 18:19.922
Sorry I'm late.

18:20.415 --> 18:22.118
I needed to prepare for the marathon

18:22.126 --> 18:23.325
that is about to happen,

18:23.327 --> 18:24.969
and you're participating too.

18:25.009 --> 18:27.460
Two bottomless mimosas, please.

18:27.485 --> 18:29.185
Oh, the best part about a mimosa-thon

18:29.187 --> 18:30.039
is you can't lose.

18:30.064 --> 18:31.865
Plus, you get to drink your medal.

18:31.890 --> 18:33.961
I-I'm fine with coffee. Thanks.

18:34.593 --> 18:36.326
If you drink too much
caffeine plus booze,

18:36.328 --> 18:37.460
you'll pee all day, dude.

18:37.462 --> 18:39.285
I'm not gonna have any booze.

18:39.931 --> 18:41.507
Sully, we need to talk.

18:41.532 --> 18:43.266
Can we wait until I
get a breakfast burrito

18:43.268 --> 18:44.667
up in this bish?

18:44.669 --> 18:46.703
You know I can't do
anything on an empty stomach.

18:46.705 --> 18:48.504
I think we need to go our separate ways.

18:48.506 --> 18:50.773
I can't tell you how
much you mean to me.

18:50.775 --> 18:52.575
I mean, you are the one who picked me up

18:52.577 --> 18:54.632
and helped me through
a dark time this year.

18:54.657 --> 18:55.979
You want to break up?

18:55.981 --> 18:57.547
You've been amazing.

18:57.549 --> 18:59.716
It's just... I-I don't know.

18:59.718 --> 19:00.932
Maybe, uh...

19:01.586 --> 19:03.644
maybe it's time to move on.

19:04.524 --> 19:05.788
That's cool.

19:05.813 --> 19:07.820
Uh, what?

19:07.845 --> 19:10.399
Dude, if that's what you
want, I think we should too.

19:10.415 --> 19:13.094
You're definitely paying
for the mimosas, though.

19:13.096 --> 19:15.096
Um, I'm sorry.

19:15.430 --> 19:18.133
This is not how my breakups usually go.

19:18.135 --> 19:19.968
You're cool?

19:19.970 --> 19:21.002
Yeah, dude.

19:21.004 --> 19:22.288
It's not that deep.

19:23.106 --> 19:25.807
Hey, you're okay, though, right?

19:25.809 --> 19:27.293
Yeah.

19:27.811 --> 19:29.294
Thanks for checking.

19:30.013 --> 19:32.539
Of course. [laughs]

19:32.564 --> 19:34.097
Do you want some?

19:34.813 --> 19:36.346
<i>I had learned from my mistake.</i>

19:36.348 --> 19:38.281
<i>The key to a grown-up relationship</i>

19:38.283 --> 19:41.707
<i>was being on the same page,

19:45.256 --> 19:47.190
<i>♪ Something inside of me ♪</i>

19:47.192 --> 19:49.759

[cheers and applause]

19:51.463 --> 19:52.758
Front page, babe!

19:52.783 --> 19:53.977
When you write about love,

19:54.002 --> 19:56.367
you're Miley Cyrus "Can't Be Tamed,"

19:56.392 --> 19:57.891
and, Luke, you...

19:57.893 --> 20:00.460
I mean, I never thought
you had it in you.

20:00.462 --> 20:01.795
What's he talking about?

20:01.797 --> 20:03.864
You said you wanted the world to know.

20:03.888 --> 20:06.297
_

20:09.037 --> 20:10.304
Not like this.

20:10.306 --> 20:12.206
It's one thing to say we started dating.

20:12.208 --> 20:14.341
It's another thing to admit
we've been lying to the boss

20:14.343 --> 20:15.442
for the past month.

20:15.444 --> 20:17.796
