- Can I turn on the radio?
- No.

01:32.801 --> 01:35.475
ERIK: Jane, you can't
keep doing this.

01:36.430 --> 01:40.367
The last 17 occurrences have
been predictable to the second.

ERIK: Jane, you're an astrophysicist,
not some storm chaser.

01:42.978 --> 01:44.871
JANE: I'm telling you,
there's a connection

01:44.896 --> 01:47.695
between these atmospheric
disturbances and my research.

01:47.774 --> 01:52.371
Erik, I wouldn't have asked you to fly
out here if I wasn't absolutely sure.

01:52.654 --> 01:53.826
DARCY: Jane?

01:54.156 --> 01:55.499
I think you want to see this.

01:59.828 --> 02:01.000
JAN E: What is that?

02:08.169 --> 02:11.064
ERIK: I thought you said
it was a subtle aurora!

02:11.089 --> 02:12.261
Go!

02:19.181 --> 02:21.575
- Get closer. - Right.
- Good one.

02:21.600 --> 02:22.692
Go!

legally your fault.

03:07.854 --> 03:09.356
JANE: Get the first aid Kit.

03:09.523 --> 03:11.166
Do me a favor and don't be dead.

03:11.191 --> 03:12.488
Please.

03:17.906 --> 03:19.328
Where did he come from?

03:37.175 --> 03:38.902
ODIN: Once,

03:38.927 --> 03:42.739
mankind accepted a simple truth,

03:42.764 --> 03:46.439
that they were not alone
in this universe.

03:48.103 --> 03:52.449
Some worlds man believed
to be home to their gods.

03:52.774 --> 03:55.527
Others, they knew to fear.

03:59.281 --> 04:03.878
From a realm of cold and
darkness came the Frost Giants,

04:15.922 --> 04:17.524
(SCREAMS)

04:17.548 --> 04:20.694
threatening to plunge the mortal
world into a new ice age.

04:20.719 --> 04:21.810
(ROARS)

04:27.601 --> 04:32.198
But humanity would not
face this threat alone.

04:46.077 --> 04:47.374
(YELLING)

05:08.642 --> 05:13.113
Our armies drove the Frost Giants back
into the heart of their own world.

05:16.566 --> 05:18.739
The cost was great.

05:19.444 --> 05:21.213
In the end,

05:21.238 --> 05:23.457
their king fell.

05:27.619 --> 05:31.123
And the source of their
power was taken from them.

05:32.040 --> 05:34.351
With the last great war ended,

05:34.376 --> 05:38.772
we withdrew from the other
worlds and returned home

05:38.797 --> 05:40.970
to the Realm Eternal,

05:42.300 --> 05:43.973
Asgard.

06:15.542 --> 06:18.261
Here we remain as
a beacon of hope,

06:19.337 --> 06:22.181
shining out across the stars.

06:23.216 --> 06:26.561
And though we have fallen
into man's myths and legends,

06:27.888 --> 06:30.198
it was Asgard

06:30.223 --> 06:32.284
and its warriors

06:32.309 --> 06:33.777
that brought peace

06:34.477 --> 06:35.524
to the universe.

06:39.566 --> 06:42.240
But the day will come

06:43.445 --> 06:45.118
when one of you

06:46.197 --> 06:48.040
will have to defend that peace.

06:48.783 --> 06:50.956
Do the Frost Giants still live?

06:51.286 --> 06:52.287
When I'm king,

06:53.288 --> 06:56.292
I'll hunt the monsters
down and slay them all!

06:57.375 --> 06:58.968
Just as you did, Father.

06:59.502 --> 07:01.095
A wise king

07:01.588 --> 07:05.263
never seeks out war.

07:10.430 --> 07:12.683
But he must always
be ready for it.

07:24.486 --> 07:26.955
- I'm ready, Father.
- So am I.

07:28.281 --> 07:30.967
Only one of you can
ascend to the throne.

09:06.046 --> 09:11.568
So long entrusted with the
mighty hammer Mjolnir,

09:11.593 --> 09:14.688
forged in the heart
of a dying star,

09:15.263 --> 09:18.074
its power has no equal,

09:18.099 --> 09:20.869
as a weapon to destroy

09:20.894 --> 09:23.113
or as a tool to build.

09:23.730 --> 09:26.404
'Tis a fit companion for a king.

09:27.901 --> 09:30.545
I have defended Asgard

09:30.570 --> 09:34.716
and the lives of the innocent
across the Nine Realms

09:34.741 --> 09:37.119
from the time of the
great beginning.

09:37.952 --> 09:39.454
Though the day has come...

10:05.897 --> 10:08.776
Do you swear to guard
the Nine Realms?

10:09.400 --> 10:10.401
I swear.

10:10.527 --> 10:13.701
And do you swear to
preserve the peace?

10:13.947 --> 10:15.290
I swear.

10:15.532 --> 10:17.375
Do you swear

10:18.368 --> 10:20.996
to cast aside all
selfish ambition

10:21.121 --> 10:24.015
and to pledge yourself only
to the good of the Realms?

10:24.040 --> 10:25.212
I swear!

10:25.458 --> 10:27.936
Then, on this day,

10:27.961 --> 10:30.589
I, Odin Allfather,

10:32.132 --> 10:33.679
proclaim you...

10:47.313 --> 10:48.485
The Frost Giants!

11:00.577 --> 11:01.703
(SPEAR THUDDING)

11:33.818 --> 11:35.879
THOR: The Jotuns must pay
for what they've done!

11:35.904 --> 11:38.248
They have paid,
with their lives.

11:39.407 --> 11:41.409
The Destroyer did its work,

11:41.743 --> 11:43.745
the Casket is safe,
and all is well.

11:44.078 --> 11:45.079
All is Well?

11:46.080 --> 11:48.683
They broke into the
weapons vault!

11:48.708 --> 11:51.352
If the Frost Giants had stolen
even one of these relics...

11:51.377 --> 11:53.630
- They didn't. - Well,
I want to know why!

11:56.299 --> 11:58.643
I have a truce with Laufey,
King of the Jotuns.

11:58.885 --> 12:03.311
He just broke your truce!
They know you are vulnerable!

12:03.806 --> 12:05.408
What action would you take?

12:05.433 --> 12:08.812
March into Jotunheim as you
once did. Teach them a lesson.

12:09.187 --> 12:10.371
Break their spirits

12:10.396 --> 12:12.582
so they'll never dare try
to cross our borders again.

12:12.607 --> 12:13.968
You're thinking
only as a warrior.

12:13.983 --> 12:15.293
This was an act of war!

12:15.318 --> 12:17.629
It was the act of but a
few, doomed to fail.

12:17.654 --> 12:19.214
Look how far they got!

12:19.239 --> 12:21.716
We will find the breach in our
defenses and it will be sealed.

12:21.741 --> 12:23.134
As King of Asgard...

12:23.159 --> 12:25.912
But you're not king!

12:28.831 --> 12:30.174
Not yer.

12:41.844 --> 12:43.471
(ROARING)

13:01.906 --> 13:04.910
It's unwise to be in my
company right now, Brother.

13:05.994 --> 13:08.838
This was to be my
day of triumph.

13:11.040 --> 13:12.383
It'll come.

13:13.668 --> 13:15.019
In time.

13:15.044 --> 13:17.297

13:18.756 --> 13:21.943
If it's any consolation,
I think you're right.

13:21.968 --> 13:24.812
About the Frost Giants, about
Laufey, about everything.

13:25.722 --> 13:28.825
If they found a way to penetrate
Asgard's defenses once,

13:28.850 --> 13:30.451
who's to say they
won't try again?

13:30.476 --> 13:32.524
- Next time with an army.
- Exactly.

without defying Father.

13:51.247 --> 13:53.057
This isn't like a

13:53.082 --> 13:55.184
where you summon a little
lightning and thunder,

13:55.209 --> 13:57.937
and the mortals
worship you as a God.

13:57.962 --> 13:59.259
This is Jotunheim.

13:59.380 --> 14:01.691
My father fought his
way into Jotunheim,

14:01.716 --> 14:04.469
defeated their armies
and took their Casket.

And Volstagg, to
delicacies so succulent,

- Thor: Enough!

15:51.075 --> 15:57.333
Never has an enemy slipped
my watch until this day.

15:58.833 --> 16:00.893
I wish to know how
that happened.

16:00.918 --> 16:03.604
Then tell no one where we have
gone until we've returned.

16:03.629 --> 16:05.472
Understand?

16:09.844 --> 16:12.155

17:06.400 --> 17:08.778

17:14.450 --> 17:15.810
HEIMDALL: To leave
the bridge open

17:15.826 --> 17:18.054
would unleash the full

26:53.070 --> 26:56.745
We are beyond diplomacy
now, Allfather.

26:58.200 --> 27:00.552
He'll get what he came for.

27:00.577 --> 27:01.624
War

27:02.204 --> 27:03.706
and death.

27:05.249 --> 27:06.842
So be it.

27:30.303 --> 27:31.583
THOR: Why did you bring us back?

27:31.608 --> 27:32.668
ODIN: Do you realize
what you've done?

27:32.693 --> 27:34.545
- What you've started? - Thor:
I was protecting my home.

27:34.570 --> 27:36.213
You cannot even
protect your friends!

27:36.238 --> 27:38.048
How can you hope to
protect a kingdom?

27:38.073 --> 27:39.842
Get him to the healing room!
Now!

27:39.867 --> 27:43.667
THOR: There won't be a kingdom to
protect if you're afraid to act.

27:44.413 --> 27:48.259
The Jotuns must learn to fear me,
just as they once feared you.

27:48.584 --> 27:50.962
ODIN: That's pride and vanity
talking, not leadership.

27:51.128 --> 27:54.148
You've forgotten everything I taught
you about a warrior's patience.

27:54.173 --> 27:57.848
While you wait and be patient,
the Nine Realms laugh at us.

27:58.135 --> 27:59.361
The old ways are done.

27:59.386 --> 28:02.114
You'd stand giving speeches
while Asgard falls.

28:02.139 --> 28:05.643
You are a vain,
greedy, cruel boy!

28:05.767 --> 28:08.771
And you are an old
man and a fool!

28:15.444 --> 28:16.787
Yes.

28:17.613 --> 28:19.286
I was a fool

28:20.324 --> 28:21.541
to think you were ready.

28:22.159 --> 28:24.503
- Father...
- (ODIN SHOUTS)

28:26.788 --> 28:29.792
Thor Odinson,

28:31.501 --> 28:34.550
you have betrayed the express
command of your king.

28:34.880 --> 28:37.482
Through your arrogance
and stupidity,

28:37.507 --> 28:40.444
you've opened these peaceful
realms and innocent lives

28:40.469 --> 28:44.190
to the horror and
desolation of war!

28:50.229 --> 28:54.154
You are unworthy
of these realms!

28:54.441 --> 28:57.127
You're unworthy of your title!

28:57.152 --> 28:58.825
You're unworthy

29:01.406 --> 29:05.957
of the loved ones
you have betrayed.

29:16.255 --> 29:18.428
I now take from you your power!

29:19.508 --> 29:22.653
In the name of my father

29:22.678 --> 29:24.897
and his father before,

29:25.180 --> 29:27.854
I, Odin Allfather, cast you out!

29:34.564 --> 29:37.834
Whosoever holds this
hammer, if he be worthy,

29:37.859 --> 29:39.532
shall possess the power of Thor.

legally your fault.

30:30.454 --> 30:31.956
Where did he come from?

30:35.834 --> 30:36.881
You all right?

30:37.044 --> 30:38.045
Hammer?

30:38.337 --> 30:39.396
Hammer?

30:39.421 --> 30:41.582
Yeah, we can tell you're
hammered. It's pretty obvious.

30:42.424 --> 30:44.651
(GASPS) Oh, my God. Erik, look at this!

30:44.676 --> 30:47.475
We have to move quickly
before this all changes.

30:48.472 --> 30:50.224
Jane, we have to take
him to the hospital.

30:50.390 --> 30:52.784
- Father! - Jane: He's
fine, look at him.

30:52.809 --> 30:56.872
Heimdall! I know you can
hear me! Open the Bifrost!

30:56.897 --> 30:58.874
JANE: Hospital. You
go, I'll stay.

30:58.899 --> 31:01.460
You. What realm is this?

31:01.485 --> 31:02.987
Alfheim? Nornheim?

31:03.111 --> 31:04.112
New Mexico?

Next time you decide
to taser somebody,

31:16.583 --> 31:19.006
make sure he's already
in the car, okay?

Jane! Come on.

31:40.148 --> 31:41.416

31:41.441 --> 31:43.990
He said it was Thor?

31:44.111 --> 31:47.331
T-H-O-R.

31:47.781 --> 31:50.467
- And your relationship to him?
- I've never met him before.

31:50.492 --> 31:51.994
Until she hit him with a car.

31:52.119 --> 31:54.793
I grazed him, but
she tasered him.

31:55.080 --> 31:56.423
Yes, I did.

31:58.125 --> 31:59.126
Hi.

32:00.502 --> 32:01.583
Just taking a little blood.

ERIK: You don't think this was
just a magnetic storm, do you?

33:31.593 --> 33:34.392
Look, the lensing
around these edges

33:34.513 --> 33:36.891
is characteristic of an
Einstein-Rosen Bridge.

33:37.098 --> 33:38.200
A what?

33:38.225 --> 33:40.368
- I thought you were a science major?
- Political science.

33:40.393 --> 33:42.287
She was the only applicant.

33:42.312 --> 33:45.040
An Einstein-Rosen Bridge is
a theoretical connection

33:45.065 --> 33:46.374
between two different
points of space-time.

33:46.399 --> 33:47.792
It's a wormhole.

33:47.817 --> 33:50.879
- Erik, look. What do you see?
- Stars.

33:50.904 --> 33:52.797
Yeah, but not our stars.

33:52.822 --> 33:56.635
See, this is the star alignment for
our quadrant this time of year,

33:56.660 --> 33:59.846
and unless Ursa Minor
decided to take a day off,

33:59.871 --> 34:02.140
these are someone
else's constellations.

No, it can't be.

at the hospital.

35:07.814 --> 35:10.041
- So now what?
- We find him.

35:10.066 --> 35:11.501
Did you see what
he did in there?

35:11.526 --> 35:13.378
I'm not sure finding
him is the best idea.

35:13.403 --> 35:15.797
Well, our data can't tell us what it
was like to be inside that event,

35:15.822 --> 35:18.550
and he can. So, we're
gonna find him.

35:18.575 --> 35:19.676
DARCY: Okay.

35:19.701 --> 35:22.387
So we're gonna look all

Oh.

My ex.

37:11.020 --> 37:15.025
Good with patients and
bad with relationships.

37:15.625 --> 37:17.585
They're the only clothes I
had that would fit you.

37:17.610 --> 37:18.657
They will suffice.

37:19.738 --> 37:20.797
You're welcome.

37:20.822 --> 37:22.302
THOR: This mortal
form has grown weak.

37:23.158 --> 37:24.205
I need sustenance.

37:43.678 --> 37:45.271
We should never have let him go.

37:45.513 --> 37:47.073
There was no stopping him.

37:47.098 --> 37:49.117
FANDRAL: Well, at least he's
only banished, not dead.

37:49.142 --> 37:50.493
Which is what we'd all be

37:50.518 --> 37:53.237
if that guard hadn't told
Odin where we'd gone.

37:59.611 --> 38:01.113
How did the guard even know?

38:01.613 --> 38:02.705
I told him.

38:04.157 --> 38:05.258
What?

38:05.283 --> 38:07.877
I told him to go to
Odin after we'd left.

38:08.036 --> 38:09.429
He should be flogged
for taking so long.

38:09.454 --> 38:11.055
We should never have
reached Jotunheim.

38:11.080 --> 38:12.127
You told the guard?

38:12.290 --> 38:14.267
I saved our lives.

38:14.292 --> 38:16.186
And Thor's.

38:16.211 --> 38:18.680
I had no idea Father would
banish him for what he did.

38:19.881 --> 38:20.882
Loki.

38:21.716 --> 38:24.435
You must go to the Allfather and
convince him to change his mind.

38:24.552 --> 38:27.197
And if I do, then what?

38:27.222 --> 38:30.066
I love Thor more dearly than any
of you, but you know what he is.

38:30.642 --> 38:33.328
He's arrogant. He's reckless.
He's dangerous.

38:33.353 --> 38:35.321
You saw how he was today.

38:35.605 --> 38:37.206
Is that what Asgard
needs from its king?

38:41.653 --> 38:46.580
He may speak of the good of Asgard,
but he's always been jealous of Thor.

38:47.575 --> 38:49.748
We should be grateful to
him, he saved our lives.

38:49.994 --> 38:51.971
Laufey said

38:51.996 --> 38:54.499
there were traitors

A master of magic could bring
three Jotuns into Asgard.

39:01.222 --> 39:02.982
FANDRAL: Loki's always
been one for mischief,

39:03.007 --> 39:05.430
but you're talking about
something else entirely.

39:25.947 --> 39:27.290

You're my son.

39:51.973 --> 39:53.975
What more than that?

39:58.730 --> 40:01.457
The Casket wasn't the only thing
you took from Jotunheim that day,

40:01.482 --> 40:02.483
was it?

40:09.240 --> 40:10.583
No.

40:12.410 --> 40:13.803
In the aftermath of the battle,

40:13.828 --> 40:16.672
I went into the temple
and I found a baby.

40:37.018 --> 40:38.361
Yes.

40:41.856 --> 40:42.948
Why?

40:43.358 --> 40:46.753
You were knee-deep in Jotun
blood, why would you take me?

40:46.778 --> 40:48.338
You were an innocent child.

40:48.363 --> 40:52.368
No. You took me for a purpose.
What was it?

40:56.037 --> 40:58.039
(SHOUTING) Tell me!

40:59.707 --> 41:02.551
I thought we could unite
our kingdoms one day.

41:02.877 --> 41:05.972
Bring about an alliance,
bring about permanent peace.

41:06.297 --> 41:07.690
Through you.

41:07.715 --> 41:08.887
What?

41:09.884 --> 41:12.307
But those plans
no longer matter.

41:13.888 --> 41:17.200
So I am no more than
another stolen relic,

41:17.225 --> 41:19.744
locked up here until you
might have use of me.

41:19.769 --> 41:21.287
Why do you twist my words?

41:21.312 --> 41:23.392
You could have told me what
I was from the beginning,

41:23.398 --> 41:24.399
why didn't you?

41:24.649 --> 41:25.821
You're my son.

41:26.401 --> 41:28.495
I wanted only to protect
you from the truth.

41:29.821 --> 41:31.631
Because I'm the monster

41:31.656 --> 41:33.750
parents tell their
children about at night?

41:33.992 --> 41:35.969
- No, no. - You know,
it all makes sense now!

41:35.994 --> 41:38.805
Why you favored Thor
all these years!

41:38.830 --> 41:41.709
Because no matter how much
you claim to love me,

41:42.166 --> 41:45.420
you could never have a Frost Giant
sitting on the throne of Asgard!

inside that cloud?

42:17.618 --> 42:20.179
DARCY: Also, how could you eat
an entire box of Pop-Tarts

42:20.204 --> 42:21.751
and still be this hungry?

42:27.545 --> 42:29.981
- This drink, I like it. - I
know. It's great, right?

42:30.006 --> 42:31.132
Another!

42:32.467 --> 42:34.219
JANE: Sorry, Izzy.
Little accident.

42:37.805 --> 42:39.949
- What was that? - It was
delicious. I want another.

42:39.974 --> 42:42.193
- Well, you could have just said so.
- I just did.

42:42.310 --> 42:45.747
- No, I mean, ask nicely.
- I meant no disrespect.

42:45.772 --> 42:47.133
All right. Well,
no more smashing.

42:47.356 --> 42:48.448
Deal?

42:50.902 --> 42:51.903
You have my word.

42:53.154 --> 42:54.201

excitement out at the crater.

43:00.495 --> 43:03.639
MAN 1: They're saying some kind of
satellite landed out in the desert.

43:03.664 --> 43:05.541
MAN 2: Yeah, we were
having a good time with it

43:05.958 --> 43:07.393
until the Feds showed up.

43:07.418 --> 43:10.313

there was a satellite crash?

43:10.338 --> 43:11.439

Oh, my God. This is going

43:16.260 --> 43:18.183
What did it look
like, the satellite?

43:19.013 --> 43:21.937
I don't know anything about
satellites, but it was heavy.

43:22.683 --> 43:26.245
I mean, nobody could lift it.

43:26.270 --> 43:28.944
They said it was radioactive.
I had my hands all over it.

43:29.190 --> 43:30.692

Fifty Miles west of here.

DRIVER: Dumbass!

43:45.998 --> 43:47.341
Where are you going?

43:47.708 --> 43:49.811
- Fifty Miles west of here.
- Why?

43:49.836 --> 43:53.272
- To get what belongs to me. - Oh,
so you own a satellite now?

43:53.297 --> 43:54.357
It's not what they say it is.

43:54.382 --> 43:55.483
Well, whatever it is,

43:55.508 --> 43:56.901
the government seems
to think it's theirs.

43:56.926 --> 43:59.028
So, you just intend to
go in there and take it?

43:59.053 --> 44:00.145
Yes.

44:01.597 --> 44:02.865
If you take me there now,

44:02.890 --> 44:04.570
I'll tell you everything
you wish to know.

44:04.934 --> 44:06.202
- Everything?
- Yes.

44:06.227 --> 44:09.080
All the answers you seek will be
yours once I reclaim Mjolnir.

44:09.105 --> 44:11.207
Myeu-muh? What's Myeu-muh?

44:11.232 --> 44:13.200
Can I have a word, Jane?

44:17.238 --> 44:18.740
Please don't do this.

44:19.157 --> 44:20.967
(SOFTLY)
You saw what I saw last night.

44:20.992 --> 44:23.469
This is no coincidence. We have to
find out what's in that crater.

44:23.494 --> 44:25.513
But I'm not talking about the
crater, I'm talking about him.

44:25.538 --> 44:28.307
- But he's promising us the answers.
- He's delusional.

44:28.332 --> 44:29.433
Listen to what he's saying.

44:29.458 --> 44:33.383
He's talking about Mjolnir
and Thor and Bifrost.

44:33.713 --> 44:35.982
It's the stories I grew
up with as a child.

44:36.007 --> 44:38.851
I'm just going to drive him.
That's it.

44:39.051 --> 44:41.053
He's dangerous, Jane.

44:46.976 --> 44:49.954
I'm sorry, but I can't take you.

Ms. Foster, I'm Agent
Coulson with S.H.I.E.L.D.

45:48.287 --> 45:50.014
Is that supposed to
mean something to me?

45:50.039 --> 45:51.336
- You can't do this!
- Jane!

45:51.707 --> 45:54.602
Jane, this is a lot more serious
than you realize. Let it go.

45:54.627 --> 45:56.675
Let it go? This is my life.

45:56.921 --> 45:59.065
We're investigating
a security threat.

45:59.090 --> 46:01.859
We need to appropriate your records
and all your atmospheric data.

46:01.884 --> 46:04.362
By "appropriate,"
do you mean steal?

46:04.387 --> 46:06.155
Here, this should more
than compensate you

46:06.180 --> 46:07.181
for your trouble.

46:07.306 --> 46:09.909
I can't just buy
replacements at Radio Shack,

46:09.934 --> 46:11.702
I made most of this
equipment myself!

46:11.727 --> 46:13.120
Then I'm sure you
can do it again.

46:13.145 --> 46:16.332
And I'm sure I can sue you for
violating my constitutional rights!

46:16.357 --> 46:18.918
I'm sorry, Ms. Foster,
but we're the good guys.

46:18.943 --> 46:21.087
So are we!

46:21.112 --> 46:24.382
I'm on the verge of understanding
something extraordinary.

46:24.407 --> 46:26.259
And everything I know
about this phenomenon

46:26.284 --> 46:28.219
is either in this lab
or in this book.

46:28.244 --> 46:30.963
And you can't just
take this away... Hey!

46:31.872 --> 46:34.842

Thank you for your cooperation.

DARCY: They even took my iPod.

47:02.862 --> 47:05.536
ERIK: What about the backups?
JANE: They took our backups.

47:05.781 --> 47:09.343
They took the backups of our backups.
They were extremely thorough.

47:09.368 --> 47:11.762
I just downloaded, like,
30 songs onto there.

47:11.787 --> 47:14.711
Could you please
stop with your iPod?

47:15.249 --> 47:17.422
Who are these people?

47:19.003 --> 47:20.880
I knew this scientist.

47:21.422 --> 47:23.983
The pioneer in gamma radiation.

47:24.008 --> 47:26.136
S.H.I.E.L.D. showed up

47:27.386 --> 47:29.059
and he wasn't heard from again.

47:29.889 --> 47:33.367
They're not gonna do that to us.
I'm gonna get everything back.

47:33.392 --> 47:36.191
Come on, please. Let me
contact one of my colleagues.

47:36.312 --> 47:38.781
He's had some dealings
with these people before.

47:39.023 --> 47:41.492
I'll e-mail him and
maybe he can help.

47:42.526 --> 47:43.994
They took your laptop, too.

with you urgently.

into the Odinsleep.

48:17.186 --> 48:19.860
Mother fears he may
never awaken again.

48:20.356 --> 48:21.573
We would speak with her.

48:21.774 --> 48:24.948
She has refused to leave
my father's bedside.

these difficult times.

49:15.744 --> 49:17.542

much left to lose.

I don't know. This time it's
different. We were unprepared.

52:33.984 --> 52:35.657
So why did he lie?

52:36.487 --> 52:40.799
He kept the truth from you so that
you would never feel different.

No, you strike me more as the
soldier of fortune type.

01:01:56.338 --> 01:01:59.182
Where was it? South Africa?

01:02:00.675 --> 01:02:04.600
Certain groups pay very well
for a good mercenary like you.

01:02:06.932 --> 01:02:08.354
Who are you?

01:02:13.271 --> 01:02:15.740
One way or another, we find
out what we need to know.

01:02:16.107 --> 01:02:17.404
We're good at that.

01:02:17.817 --> 01:02:19.444
(PAGER BEEPING)

01:02:23.156 --> 01:02:24.499
Don't go anywhere.

01:02:30.956 --> 01:02:33.459
Loki! What are you doing here?

01:02:33.792 --> 01:02:35.294
I had to see you.

01:02:36.962 --> 01:02:38.305
What's happened?

01:02:38.630 --> 01:02:40.632
Tell me. Is it Jotunheim?

01:02:40.966 --> 01:02:42.442
Let me explain to Father.

01:02:42.467 --> 01:02:43.810
Father is dead.

01:02:49.975 --> 01:02:51.318
What?

01:02:53.144 --> 01:02:54.817
Your banishment,

01:02:55.814 --> 01:02:57.987
the threat of a new war,

01:02:59.067 --> 01:03:00.819
it was too much for him to bear.

01:03:03.488 --> 01:03:05.661
You mustn't blame yourself.

01:03:06.491 --> 01:03:07.993
I know that you loved him.

01:03:08.910 --> 01:03:11.663
I tried to tell him so,
but he wouldn't listen.

01:03:13.873 --> 01:03:16.226
It was so cruel to put the
hammer within your reach,

01:03:16.251 --> 01:03:18.219
knowing that you
could never lift it.

01:03:21.548 --> 01:03:23.801
The burden of the throne
has fallen to me now.

01:03:30.390 --> 01:03:32.063
Can I come home?

01:03:32.976 --> 01:03:35.980
The truce with Jotunheim is
conditional upon your exile.

01:03:36.313 --> 01:03:42.446
- Yes, but couldn't we find a way...
- And Mother has forbidden your return.

01:03:45.780 --> 01:03:47.407
This is goodbye, Brother.

01:03:49.826 --> 01:03:51.749
I'm so sorry.

01:03:57.334 --> 01:03:58.506
No.

01:04:00.003 --> 01:04:01.676
I am sorry.

01:04:07.093 --> 01:04:09.346
Thank you for coming here.

01:04:13.850 --> 01:04:15.193
Farewell.

01:04:28.281 --> 01:04:29.533
Goodbye.

01:04:30.533 --> 01:04:31.534
Good bye?

01:04:32.118 --> 01:04:33.461
I just got back.

01:04:38.333 --> 01:04:40.301

01:05:09.406 --> 01:05:10.407
Sir?

01:05:11.324 --> 01:05:12.667
He's got a visitor.

01:05:18.164 --> 01:05:19.837
His name is Donald Blake?

01:05:20.083 --> 01:05:21.756
Dr. Donald Blake.

01:05:21.960 --> 01:05:23.712
You have dangerous
coworkers, Dr. Selvig.

01:05:24.003 --> 01:05:27.849
He was distraught when he found out
that you've taken all our research.

01:05:28.425 --> 01:05:30.928
That was years of
his life, gone!

01:05:32.846 --> 01:05:35.190
You can understand how a man
could go off like that.

01:05:35.598 --> 01:05:37.784
A big, faceless
organization like yours

01:05:37.809 --> 01:05:39.732
coming in with their
jackbooted thugs and...

01:05:41.938 --> 01:05:43.360
That's how he put it.

01:05:43.523 --> 01:05:44.624
That still doesn't explain

01:05:44.649 --> 01:05:46.369
how he managed to tear
through our security.

01:05:46.609 --> 01:05:50.004
Steroids! He's a bit
of a fitness nut.

01:05:50.029 --> 01:05:51.589

It says here that he's an M.D.

01:05:59.038 --> 01:06:01.391
Well, he is! Or he was.

01:06:01.416 --> 01:06:03.965
He switched careers and
became a physicist.

01:06:04.169 --> 01:06:06.020
A brilliant physicist.

01:06:06.045 --> 01:06:08.264
He's a wonderful man.
He's a man in pain.

ERIK: Oh, Donny, Donny, Donny!

01:06:14.053 --> 01:06:18.058
There you are. You're gonna be all
right. I'm taking you home now.

01:06:35.074 --> 01:06:37.497
Just keep him away
from the bars.

01:06:37.994 --> 01:06:39.337
I will!

01:06:41.164 --> 01:06:44.008
- Where are we going?
- To get a drink.

01:06:44.334 --> 01:06:45.677
Follow them.

01:06:52.091 --> 01:06:54.264
You know, I had
it all backwards.

01:06:56.346 --> 01:06:57.848
I had it all wrong.

01:07:01.267 --> 01:07:04.942
It's not a bad thing finding out
that you don't have all the answers.

01:07:05.355 --> 01:07:07.198
You start asking the
right questions.

01:07:11.361 --> 01:07:15.423
For the first time in my life,

01:07:15.448 --> 01:07:20.079
I have no idea what
I'm supposed to do.

01:07:21.120 --> 01:07:24.140
Anyone who's ever going to
find his way in this world

01:07:24.165 --> 01:07:27.294
has to start by admitting he
doesn't know where the hell he is.

01:07:29.212 --> 01:07:30.805
Thank you for what you've done.

01:07:30.964 --> 01:07:33.308
No, don't thank me. I
only did it for Jane.

01:07:34.884 --> 01:07:37.558
Her father and I taught
at university together.

01:07:37.887 --> 01:07:39.480
He was a good man.

01:07:40.473 --> 01:07:41.565
He never listened.

01:07:42.892 --> 01:07:44.485
Neither did I.

01:07:45.728 --> 01:07:47.872
My father was trying
to teach me something,

01:07:47.897 --> 01:07:49.820
but I was too stupid to see it.

01:07:50.900 --> 01:07:55.004
I don't know if you're delusional or
if you're pulling some kind of con,

01:07:55.029 --> 01:07:56.422
I don't care.

01:07:56.447 --> 01:07:57.790
I just care about her.

01:07:59.158 --> 01:08:01.581
I've seen the way
she looks at you.

01:08:04.914 --> 01:08:07.508
I swear to you, I
mean her no harm.

01:08:07.750 --> 01:08:08.751
Good.

01:08:09.419 --> 01:08:13.424
In that case, I'll buy you another
round, and you leave town tonight.

01:08:18.595 --> 01:08:20.438
Two boilermakers.

01:09:12.023 --> 01:09:13.616
LAUFEY: Kill him.

01:09:15.109 --> 01:09:17.203
After all I've done for you?

01:09:19.572 --> 01:09:24.203
So you're the one who showed
us the way into Asgard.

01:09:24.535 --> 01:09:26.707
That was just a bit
of fun, really.

01:09:27.872 --> 01:09:30.876
To ruin my brother's big day.

01:09:31.709 --> 01:09:35.555
And to protect the realm from his
idiotic rule for a while longer.

01:09:36.839 --> 01:09:39.183
I will hear you.

01:09:42.595 --> 01:09:47.066
I will conceal you and a
handful of your soldiers,

01:09:47.725 --> 01:09:52.731
lead you into Odin's chambers, and
you can slay him where he lies.

01:09:53.147 --> 01:09:54.865
Why not kill him yourself?

01:09:55.108 --> 01:09:56.280
(SNORTS)

01:09:56.943 --> 01:09:59.671
I suspect that the Asgardians
would not take kindly

01:09:59.696 --> 01:10:01.949
to a king who had
murdered his predecessor.

01:10:03.116 --> 01:10:06.211
Once Odin is dead, I will
return the Casket to you

01:10:08.287 --> 01:10:11.291
and you can return
Jotunheim to all its...

01:10:14.168 --> 01:10:15.511
Glory.

01:10:19.632 --> 01:10:21.475
Accept.

01:10:27.306 --> 01:10:28.899
What troubles you, Gatekeeper?

01:10:29.142 --> 01:10:34.148
I turned my gaze upon you in Jotunheim,
but could neither see you nor hear you.

01:10:34.814 --> 01:10:36.124
You were shrouded from me,

01:10:36.149 --> 01:10:38.322
like the Frost Giants
that entered this realm.

01:10:38.651 --> 01:10:42.046
Perhaps your senses have weakened
after your many years of service.

01:10:42.071 --> 01:10:43.798
Or perhaps someone
has found a way

01:10:43.823 --> 01:10:46.918
to hide that which he
does not wish me to see.

01:10:48.161 --> 01:10:50.255
You have great power, Heimdall.

01:10:52.749 --> 01:10:54.251
Did Odin ever fear you?

01:10:56.502 --> 01:10:58.175
- No.
- And why is that?

01:10:58.421 --> 01:11:01.516
Because he is my king and
I am sworn to obey him.

01:11:01.841 --> 01:11:06.017
He was your king and you're
sworn to obey me now.

01:11:06.846 --> 01:11:07.938
Yes?

01:11:13.436 --> 01:11:14.779
Yes.

01:11:15.480 --> 01:11:18.249
Then you will open the
Bifrost to no one

01:11:18.274 --> 01:11:21.118
until I have repaired the damage
that my brother has done.

01:11:38.211 --> 01:11:40.213
He's fine. Not injured at all.

- (GROANS)
- I'm sorry, my friend.

01:11:42.757 --> 01:11:44.609
- What happened? - We
drank, we fought,

01:11:44.634 --> 01:11:46.136
he made his ancestors proud.

01:11:46.594 --> 01:11:48.437
Put him on the bed.

01:11:53.851 --> 01:11:55.228

01:11:56.521 --> 01:11:57.773
(LAUGHING)

01:11:59.649 --> 01:12:03.244
I still don't think you're
the God of Thunder.

01:12:03.903 --> 01:12:06.076
But you ought to be.

01:12:17.166 --> 01:12:18.668
Are these your chambers?

01:12:19.085 --> 01:12:22.760
It's more of a temporary
living situation.

01:12:23.589 --> 01:12:27.435
I'm sorry. I don't
usually have guests.

01:12:28.094 --> 01:12:30.938
Actually, I never have guests.

01:12:33.099 --> 01:12:35.272
That's not the right
place for it.

01:12:36.269 --> 01:12:37.942
I'm sorry.

01:12:41.023 --> 01:12:42.070
Can we go outside?

01:12:42.942 --> 01:12:44.364
Yes, of course.

01:12:49.866 --> 01:12:52.218
I come up here sometimes
when I can't sleep

01:12:52.243 --> 01:12:56.373
or I'm trying to reconcile particle
data, or when Darcy's driving me crazy.

01:12:57.623 --> 01:13:00.968
I come up here a lot, actually,
now that I think about it.

01:13:04.964 --> 01:13:06.887
I'm really glad you're safe.

01:13:07.967 --> 01:13:10.470
You've been very kind to me,

01:13:11.178 --> 01:13:13.397
and I've been far less
grateful than you deserve.

01:13:13.556 --> 01:13:15.324
Well, I hit you with
my car a couple times,

01:13:15.349 --> 01:13:17.397
so I think that kind
of evens things out.

01:13:19.812 --> 01:13:21.655
Perhaps I had it coming.

01:13:27.486 --> 01:13:28.829
Oh, my God!

01:13:30.072 --> 01:13:31.415
I don't believe it!

01:13:31.657 --> 01:13:35.136
It was all I could get back. I'm sorry
it's not as much as I promised.

01:13:35.161 --> 01:13:39.837
No, no, this is great! This is... I
don't have to start from scratch now.

01:13:40.166 --> 01:13:41.509
Thank you.

01:13:46.172 --> 01:13:47.594
What's wrong?

01:13:49.008 --> 01:13:50.067
S.H.l.E.L.D.

01:13:50.092 --> 01:13:51.435
Whatever they are,

01:13:52.929 --> 01:13:54.614
they're gonna do
everything in their power

01:13:54.639 --> 01:13:57.358
to make sure this research
never sees the light of day.

01:13:57.516 --> 01:13:58.859
No, Jane.

01:13:59.435 --> 01:14:01.358
Listen to me. You
must not give up.

01:14:01.604 --> 01:14:03.606
- You must finish what you've started.
- Why?

01:14:03.856 --> 01:14:05.449
Because you're right.

01:14:05.942 --> 01:14:07.285
Here, look.

01:14:09.862 --> 01:14:13.366
Your ancestors called it magic,
and you call it science.

01:14:13.950 --> 01:14:16.703
Well, I come from a place where
they're one and the same thing.

01:14:31.300 --> 01:14:32.893
What is that?

01:14:33.886 --> 01:14:37.073
My father explained
it to me like this,

01:14:37.098 --> 01:14:38.908
that your world

01:14:38.933 --> 01:14:41.827
is one of the Nine
Realms of the Cosmos,

01:14:41.852 --> 01:14:44.856
linked to each other by the
branches of Yggdrasil,

01:14:45.231 --> 01:14:47.154
the Worlds Tree.

01:14:47.400 --> 01:14:50.074
Now you see it every
day without realizing.

01:14:50.403 --> 01:14:53.407
The images glimpsed through...
What did you call it?

01:14:53.906 --> 01:14:55.658
This Hooble Telescope.

01:14:56.242 --> 01:14:59.136
- Hubble.
- Hubble Telescope.

01:14:59.161 --> 01:15:00.333
(LAUGHS)

01:15:02.164 --> 01:15:03.507
Tell me more.

01:15:04.083 --> 01:15:05.585
So, the Nine Realms.

01:15:06.252 --> 01:15:08.755
Now, there is Midgard,
which is Earth.

01:15:09.088 --> 01:15:10.590
This is Alfheim.

01:15:10.923 --> 01:15:13.597
Vanaheim. Jotunheim.

01:15:14.427 --> 01:15:15.770
And Asgard.

01:15:16.262 --> 01:15:18.185
And that's where I come from.

01:15:35.614 --> 01:15:36.957
Thank you, Jane.

01:15:40.369 --> 01:15:43.389
FANDRAL: Our dearest friend
banished, Loki on the throne,

01:15:43.414 --> 01:15:46.793
Asgard on the brink of war,
yet you've managed to consume

01:15:46.959 --> 01:15:50.104
four wild boar, six
pheasant, a side of beef,

01:15:50.129 --> 01:15:53.599
and two casks of ale. Shame
on you. Don't you care?

01:15:54.383 --> 01:15:56.477
Do not mistake my
appetite for apathy!

01:15:56.719 --> 01:15:58.562
Stop it, both of you!

01:15:58.888 --> 01:15:59.889
Stop.

01:16:01.223 --> 01:16:03.646
- We all know what we have to do.
- We must go.

01:16:06.228 --> 01:16:08.572
We must find Thor.

01:16:09.732 --> 01:16:10.733
It's treason.

01:16:10.983 --> 01:16:12.735
To hell with treason,
it's suicide.

01:16:12.985 --> 01:16:14.987
Thor would do the same for us.

01:16:16.072 --> 01:16:17.415
Now shush.

01:16:18.991 --> 01:16:21.302

01:36:59.605 --> 01:37:01.152
(YELLING)

01:37:24.797 --> 01:37:25.798
(LAUGHING)

01:37:41.147 --> 01:37:43.070
Thor!

01:37:49.822 --> 01:37:51.324
Brother, please.

01:37:55.244 --> 01:37:56.245
(LAUGHING)

01:38:02.835 --> 01:38:04.007
Enough!

01:38:24.148 --> 01:38:25.149
(GRUNTING)

01:38:35.201 --> 01:38:36.578
(SCREAMING)

01:38:47.797 --> 01:38:48.969
Look at you,

01:38:51.634 --> 01:38:52.977
the Mighty Thor,

01:38:56.055 --> 01:38:58.228
with all your strength,

01:38:58.891 --> 01:39:01.565
and what good does
it do you now, huh?

01:39:02.895 --> 01:39:06.695
Do you hear me, Brother?
There's nothing you can do!

01:39:24.667 --> 01:39:25.964
What are you doing?

01:39:27.670 --> 01:39:31.049
If you destroy the bridge,
you'll never see her again!

01:39:40.683 --> 01:39:42.356
Forgive me, Jane.

01:39:43.936 --> 01:39:45.984
(BOTH YELLING)

01:40:20.848 --> 01:40:22.850
I could have done it, Father!

01:40:23.851 --> 01:40:25.694
I could have done it!

01:40:26.103 --> 01:40:27.446
For you!

01:40:28.147 --> 01:40:29.649
For all of us!

01:40:31.817 --> 01:40:33.160
NO, Loki.

01:40:41.911 --> 01:40:42.912
Loki, no.

01:40:44.163 --> 01:40:46.336
No!

01:40:50.586 --> 01:40:51.758
No.

01:41:08.104 --> 01:41:09.447
JANE: it's gone.

01:42:16.672 --> 01:42:18.595
(ALL LAUGHING)

01:42:21.969 --> 01:42:24.813
And then, with a mighty bellow,

01:42:25.056 --> 01:42:29.152
I flew into the giant metal
creature and laid him low!

01:42:29.310 --> 01:42:32.955
FANDRAL: Is that another way of
saying you fell on your huge ass?

01:42:32.980 --> 01:42:38.987
VOLSTAGG: As a matter of fact, falling
was a tactic lulling the Destroyer...

01:42:53.167 --> 01:42:56.011
My Queen, I'm so
sorry for your loss.

01:43:01.842 --> 01:43:03.185
FRIGGA: How is he?

01:43:05.513 --> 01:43:07.515
SIF: He mourns for his brother.

01:43:08.849 --> 01:43:10.021
And...

01:43:11.185 --> 01:43:12.778
He misses hen.

01:43:13.771 --> 01:43:15.114
The mortal.

01:43:31.539 --> 01:43:33.291
You'll be a wise king.

01:43:37.712 --> 01:43:40.135
There will never be a
wiser king than you.

01:43:41.549 --> 01:43:43.222
Or a better father.

01:43:54.103 --> 01:43:57.277
I have much to learn.

01:43:59.275 --> 01:44:00.777
I know that now.

01:44:05.781 --> 01:44:07.749
Someday, perhaps,

01:44:09.034 --> 01:44:10.957
I shall make you proud.

01:44:18.586 --> 01:44:20.805
You've already made me proud.

01:44:35.352 --> 01:44:37.354
So Earth is lost to us.

01:44:38.689 --> 01:44:39.690
No.

01:44:40.691 --> 01:44:42.693
There is always hope.

01:44:46.697 --> 01:44:48.199
Can you see her?

01:44:49.492 --> 01:44:51.093
(HEIMDALL LAUGHS)

01:44:51.118 --> 01:44:52.461
Yes.

01:44:56.123 --> 01:44:58.100
ERIK: I have the
particle detectors!

01:44:58.125 --> 01:45:00.269
Darcy, do you have the
S.H.I.E.L.D. satellite codes?

01:45:00.294 --> 01:45:02.438
DARCY: Yeah. Have
you seen my taser?

01:45:02.463 --> 01:45:03.939
THOR: How is she?

01:45:03.964 --> 01:45:06.058
ERIK: In the car. Come on, Jane!

01:45:06.383 --> 01:45:08.477
HEIMDALL: She searches for you.

01:53:18.041 --> 01:53:19.964
NICK FURY: Dr. Selvig.

01:53:22.796 --> 01:53:24.969
So you're the man
behind all this?

01:53:27.134 --> 01:53:29.136
It's quite a labyrinth.

01:53:29.886 --> 01:53:33.811
I was thinking they're taking
me down here to kill me.

01:53:40.981 --> 01:53:43.985
I've been hearing about
the New Mexico situation.

01:53:44.818 --> 01:53:48.547
Your work has impressed a lot of
people who are much smarter than I am.

01:53:48.572 --> 01:53:50.574
I have a lot to work with.

01:53:51.158 --> 01:53:54.458
The Foster Theory. A gateway
to another dimension.

01:53:55.120 --> 01:53:56.121
It's unprecedented.

01:53:58.832 --> 01:54:00.084
Isn't it?

01:54:03.503 --> 01:54:06.848
Legend tells us one
thing, history, another.

01:54:07.174 --> 01:54:11.395
But every now and then, we find
something that belongs to both.

01:54:19.186 --> 01:54:20.245
What is it?

01:54:20.270 --> 01:54:21.396
Power, Doctor.

01:54:21.938 --> 01:54:23.940
If we can figure
out how to tap it,

01:54:24.358 --> 01:54:25.860
maybe unlimited power.

01:54:31.615 --> 01:54:33.868
Well, I guess that's
worth a look.

01:54:35.619 --> 01:54:37.872
Well, I guess that's
worth a look.
