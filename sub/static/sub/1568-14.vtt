WEBVTT

00:01.210 --> 00:02.460
Previously on "The 100"...

00:02.670 --> 00:05.546
Thelonious is gone.
He took 12 people, 12 guns.

00:05.756 --> 00:07.256
We're going to
the city of light.

00:07.466 --> 00:09.300
Take this leap of
faith with me, John Murphy,

00:09.510 --> 00:14.430
and let me show you there is
so much more for you... Than this.

00:14.640 --> 00:16.265
Biggest army
we've ever had

00:16.475 --> 00:18.142
waits for us to
give it a mission.

00:18.352 --> 00:20.895
We will, after Bellamy
turns off the acid fog.

00:21.105 --> 00:22.063
If this is an alliance

00:22.272 --> 00:23.773
between the outsiders
and the ark,

00:23.983 --> 00:25.483
we shouldn't take
this threat lightly.

00:25.693 --> 00:27.443
There's a war council
meeting happening tonight

00:27.653 --> 00:29.070
and all the leaders
are gonna be there.

00:29.279 --> 00:30.071
We're gonna use
a missile.

00:30.280 --> 00:31.447
We have to
start evacuating.

00:31.657 --> 00:32.699
If we evacuate,
they'll know

00:32.908 --> 00:34.325
we have a spy
inside their walls.

00:34.535 --> 00:36.244
We slip away.
Right now.

00:36.453 --> 00:37.286
Fire.

00:40.791 --> 00:42.041
You knew and you
let this happen?

00:43.252 --> 00:45.003
Some of them aren't
wearing Hazmat suits.

00:45.212 --> 00:47.588
Means they're cured.
Marrow treatments work.

00:47.798 --> 00:51.801
We started taking them
from the dorm, one at a time.

00:52.011 --> 00:55.304
They're not taking anyone else
out of this room without a fight.

00:55.514 --> 00:56.305
Yaah!

00:56.515 --> 00:57.306
Uhh!

00:57.516 --> 00:58.307
Find them.

00:58.517 --> 00:59.559
We're going
to hide you.

00:59.768 --> 01:00.977
Not everyone
here agrees with Cage.

01:01.186 --> 01:02.478
Come with me.
You're safe now.

01:08.193 --> 01:09.527
It'd sure be nice to have some sign

01:09.737 --> 01:11.529
that we're not just
marching to our own deaths.

01:15.200 --> 01:16.659
We're not.

01:16.869 --> 01:18.703
Hey, tell me
if you know this one.

01:18.912 --> 01:20.747
Not again, please.

01:20.956 --> 01:22.832
A Grounder
and a reaper walk into a bar.

01:23.042 --> 01:25.334
The bartender looks to
the Grounder, he says,

01:25.544 --> 01:26.836
"We don't serve your
kind around here."

01:27.046 --> 01:28.337
The reaper gets up
and leaves.

01:32.509 --> 01:34.260
You get it?
Reapers eat Grounders.

01:34.470 --> 01:35.845
I will take
Jaha's staff

01:36.055 --> 01:37.180
and beat you
to death with it.

01:37.389 --> 01:39.015
John.

01:39.224 --> 01:40.058
Or this one.

01:40.267 --> 01:41.768
Uh, an Arker,
a Grounder,

01:41.977 --> 01:43.728
and a Mountain
man walk into a bar.

01:43.937 --> 01:45.813
Arker says, "I'll take some
moonshine."

01:46.023 --> 01:48.149
Grounder says,
"I'll take some, too."

01:48.358 --> 01:49.984
The Mountain man, he says--

02:05.167 --> 02:06.417
Aah!

02:18.013 --> 02:18.971
No one move!

02:20.599 --> 02:21.974
We're in the middle
of a minefield.

02:25.562 --> 02:27.063
Anybody else want a sign?

03:04.143 --> 03:06.435
It's about
time, lieutenant.

03:06.645 --> 03:07.854
Yes, sir.

03:08.063 --> 03:09.522
Brief me on the 44.

03:11.108 --> 03:11.941
I have soldiers

03:12.151 --> 03:13.609
going from
room to room.

03:13.819 --> 03:15.027
It's only a matter
of time.

03:16.155 --> 03:17.280
So, you have nothing.

03:22.411 --> 03:23.286
Yes, sir.

03:24.454 --> 03:25.413
Those kids
are the key

03:25.622 --> 03:27.415
to everything,
lieutenant.

03:27.624 --> 03:29.584
And 44 people
don't just vanish

03:29.793 --> 03:31.002
inside of
a sealed bunker.

03:31.211 --> 03:32.628
They could if they
had enough help.

03:33.922 --> 03:35.423
My father.

03:35.632 --> 03:37.466
It's unclear, sir.

03:37.676 --> 03:38.676
But he's not
the only one

03:38.886 --> 03:40.178
with moral
reservations about

03:40.387 --> 03:41.721
what we've done
to survive.

03:41.930 --> 03:43.222
What they don't
realize is that

03:43.432 --> 03:44.974
those kids
are dangerous.

03:45.184 --> 03:46.976
They irradiated
an entire level.

03:47.186 --> 03:48.311
I agree, sir.

03:48.520 --> 03:50.479
And now that level 5
has been decontaminated,

03:50.689 --> 03:52.440
we can tell the truth
about that.

03:52.649 --> 03:55.818
Those kids killed
10 of our soldiers.

03:56.028 --> 03:57.653
We can use that
to flush them out.

03:59.448 --> 04:00.323
Do it.

04:00.532 --> 04:02.533
Yes, sir.

04:02.743 --> 04:04.952
Now let's talk
about the outside threat.

04:05.162 --> 04:06.037
Look at that.

04:08.707 --> 04:12.293
Her entire army stopped
just outside the veil's range.

04:12.461 --> 04:13.461
Why?

04:13.670 --> 04:15.421
They're learning, sir.
I told you

04:15.631 --> 04:16.756
this commander
was different.

04:16.965 --> 04:19.342
What's she gonna do?
Wait us out?

04:19.551 --> 04:22.511
We've been safe down
here for 97 years.

04:22.721 --> 04:25.556
She's gonna lose patience,
and when she does,

04:25.766 --> 04:26.933
deploy the fog.

04:40.197 --> 04:41.364
What if
we're wrong

04:41.573 --> 04:43.032
and cutting
the power doesn't

04:43.242 --> 04:45.034
disengage the locks?

04:45.244 --> 04:46.577
Your people
said it will.

04:52.084 --> 04:53.417
You should rest, Clarke.

04:54.878 --> 04:56.295
We could blow
the doors manually.

04:57.798 --> 04:59.632
Plans don't last
very long in battle.

05:01.802 --> 05:04.220
Tiring yourself with
questions already asked and answered

05:04.429 --> 05:05.930
is a waste of energy.

05:06.139 --> 05:07.515
People died
for this, Lexa.

05:11.103 --> 05:12.103
It has to work.

05:14.564 --> 05:16.732
You're doing what I did
when I first took command.

05:20.070 --> 05:21.612
We can't move forward
and it's giving you

05:21.822 --> 05:23.656
too much time to think.

05:23.865 --> 05:25.074
Once Bellamy shuts down
the acid fog

05:25.284 --> 05:26.075
and the battle
begins,

05:26.285 --> 05:27.368
everything will
be clear.

05:30.205 --> 05:31.289
What if he can't?

05:33.709 --> 05:34.750
What if it was
too dangerous

05:34.960 --> 05:36.127
and I sent him
in there anyway?

05:37.462 --> 05:38.546
You care about him.

05:40.507 --> 05:42.216
I care about
all of them.

05:44.177 --> 05:46.262
Yet you worry
about him more.

05:46.471 --> 05:49.056
I couldn't have kept us
alive all this time without him.

05:49.266 --> 05:50.224
We need him.

05:51.977 --> 05:54.687
And now I might be the one
who gets him killed.

05:54.896 --> 05:57.481
That's what it means
to be a leader, Clarke.

05:57.691 --> 05:58.899
The truth is,
we must look into

05:59.109 --> 06:00.443
the eyes of our
warriors and say,

06:00.652 --> 06:02.445
"Go die for me."

06:02.654 --> 06:04.071
If only it were
that easy.

06:05.782 --> 06:07.867
Can we please just
get back to the plan?

06:08.076 --> 06:09.076
No.

06:11.163 --> 06:13.164
You could be a leader
your people look to.

06:14.666 --> 06:16.834
Pour their hopes
and dreams into.

06:18.962 --> 06:21.297
Someone they will
fight and die for.

06:21.506 --> 06:23.299
I never asked
for that.

06:25.469 --> 06:27.011
I'm just trying
to keep us alive.

06:37.272 --> 06:38.814
You were born
for this, Clarke.

06:41.610 --> 06:42.735
Same as me.

06:58.377 --> 07:00.711
Bellamy. Come in.

07:00.921 --> 07:02.755
Yeah, I'm a little
busy here, raven.

07:02.964 --> 07:04.090
You missed
check-in.

07:04.299 --> 07:06.050
Did you find the source
of the acid fog yet?

07:06.259 --> 07:07.593
I'm making my way
there now.

07:07.803 --> 07:10.179
It's taking longer
than I thought.

07:10.389 --> 07:12.264
I don't know enough
to crack it on this end.

07:12.474 --> 07:13.682
You gotta
give me something.

07:13.892 --> 07:14.934
I'm working on it.

07:18.814 --> 07:20.439
Something's wrong.

07:20.649 --> 07:21.482
What?

07:21.691 --> 07:23.651
My key card
isn't working.

07:23.860 --> 07:24.693
That's not good.

07:24.903 --> 07:26.987
I need to find
another way in.

07:27.197 --> 07:28.948
I'll call you back.

07:29.157 --> 07:31.951
Stay right there!
Hands in the air.

07:34.621 --> 07:37.123
Eastbound.
In pursuit of the target.

07:37.332 --> 07:39.834
He's not Lovejoy.
Repeat, he's not Lovejoy.

07:52.931 --> 07:53.806
Split up.

07:57.853 --> 08:00.187
Checking in. We're heading
down to the base level.

08:02.149 --> 08:05.234
You're surrounded!
There's no way out!

08:12.200 --> 08:13.159
Keep your eyes open.

08:13.368 --> 08:14.368
Garza, do you see him?

08:16.538 --> 08:18.247
Uhh!

08:18.457 --> 08:19.290
Uhh!

08:22.711 --> 08:24.587
Garza,
what's your status?

08:24.796 --> 08:25.963
Garza.

08:28.091 --> 08:29.758
Garza. Do you see him?

08:43.940 --> 08:46.233
I've been summoned?
Really?

08:46.443 --> 08:48.068
Yeah. Thanks.

08:48.278 --> 08:50.237
I need your help on
this acid fog deal.

08:50.447 --> 08:51.739
Bellamy will radio
again when he gets

08:51.948 --> 08:52.990
eyes on the
dispersal system,

08:53.200 --> 08:54.450
but I want to talk
it through first.

08:54.659 --> 08:56.619
I think--
what's funny?

08:56.828 --> 08:58.579
Oh, come on.
It's a banner day.

08:58.788 --> 09:01.373
You gotta see that.
Raven Reyes asking for help?

09:01.583 --> 09:03.042
It's one for
the history books.

09:03.251 --> 09:04.502
Never mind.
I'll do it on my own.

09:04.711 --> 09:06.337
Hey. Joke.

09:06.546 --> 09:08.464
Humor.
It's just what I do.

09:08.673 --> 09:10.508
There are a thousand Grounders
camped in the woods

09:10.717 --> 09:13.302
waiting to go get
my friends,

09:13.512 --> 09:15.054
and they can't move
because--

09:16.348 --> 09:17.806
because I can't
figure this out.

09:18.934 --> 09:21.101
Hey. No one could.

09:21.311 --> 09:23.395
It's a tough ask,
not without more data.

09:27.317 --> 09:30.611
OK. So, they make fog
that melts people.

09:30.820 --> 09:33.364
What are we talking?
Nucleation?

09:33.573 --> 09:36.492
Oh, please tell me it's
brownian diffusion.

09:36.701 --> 09:38.452
I'll have you know

09:38.662 --> 09:40.621
I was a God
at fluid dynamics.

09:40.830 --> 09:42.331
You think you were a
God at everything.

09:44.751 --> 09:46.377
Empirical evidence
doesn't lie.

09:51.675 --> 09:55.219
All right.
Let's get our stoichiometry on.

10:25.292 --> 10:26.959
Everything OK?

10:27.168 --> 10:29.128
I'm going over it
and over it in my head,

10:29.337 --> 10:32.339
just trying to
figure out how

10:32.549 --> 10:33.757
you're still alive.

10:36.386 --> 10:37.803
What are you
talking about?

10:38.013 --> 10:41.348
I saw you in Tondc
before the missile hit.

10:41.558 --> 10:44.226
I know you, Clarke.
Something's wrong.

10:44.436 --> 10:45.894
And then you and Lexa
disappear

10:46.104 --> 10:47.354
and just happen
to survive.

10:49.774 --> 10:51.275
Tell me you didn't
know it was coming.

10:58.408 --> 10:59.491
Octavia...

11:05.040 --> 11:06.957
You let all those
people die.

11:09.169 --> 11:10.961
You were gonna
let me die.

11:12.255 --> 11:14.506
I did it
to save Bellamy,

11:14.716 --> 11:16.342
so that we could
win this war.

11:16.551 --> 11:18.135
Don't you see that?

11:18.345 --> 11:19.970
If we'd evacuated Tondc,

11:20.180 --> 11:20.971
Mount Weather
would've known that

11:21.181 --> 11:22.348
someone tipped us off.

11:22.557 --> 11:24.099
They would have found
your brother.

11:24.309 --> 11:26.018
No. Bellamy
would have never

11:26.227 --> 11:27.144
told you to do that.

11:27.354 --> 11:28.479
He would've found
another way.

11:30.732 --> 11:32.983
I couldn't
take that risk.

11:33.193 --> 11:35.861
Right. Because you're
in charge now,

11:36.071 --> 11:37.488
and you decide
who is disposable.

11:40.075 --> 11:41.950
You'd have fit right in
on the council.

11:45.121 --> 11:46.455
Hey. Octavia.

11:46.665 --> 11:47.498
What?

11:52.504 --> 11:53.671
You can't tell anyone.

11:54.881 --> 11:55.964
If people
found out--

11:56.174 --> 11:57.007
the alliance
will break.

11:59.386 --> 12:00.719
I'm not
an idiot, Clarke.

12:07.143 --> 12:07.976
Commander.

12:08.186 --> 12:09.937
Octavia.

12:10.146 --> 12:12.523
It is time for the southernmost
guard post's rotation.

12:12.732 --> 12:14.233
You should
relieve them.

12:14.442 --> 12:17.945
Indra expects me to be on a
scouting mission with Lincoln.

12:18.154 --> 12:19.613
Now you're needed
at the guard post.

12:20.865 --> 12:21.907
Indra will join you
there shortly.

12:40.719 --> 12:42.886
She won't say anything.

12:43.096 --> 12:44.430
You can't be sure
of that.

12:46.099 --> 12:47.558
Too many people
know, Clarke.

12:49.811 --> 12:52.229
You worry about your people,
I'll worry about mine.

13:22.719 --> 13:24.011
Vincent, I need
your help.

13:27.140 --> 13:29.016
It's all over the radio.
They know about you.

13:29.225 --> 13:30.225
Did anyone see you
come here?

13:30.435 --> 13:31.769
No. Been keeping
to the vents

13:31.978 --> 13:33.187
and unmonitored halls,
like you said.

13:33.396 --> 13:34.229
Vincent.

13:36.191 --> 13:37.024
It's OK.

13:37.233 --> 13:38.358
Lee's one of us.

13:38.568 --> 13:41.111
Dante was like
a father to me.

13:41.321 --> 13:43.655
Some of us don't agree
with Cage's agenda.

13:43.865 --> 13:44.865
Where's Jasper,
Monty, and Maya?

13:45.074 --> 13:45.866
They're OK.

13:46.075 --> 13:47.284
Thanks to Lee,
we moved them

13:47.494 --> 13:48.702
to a wing that's already
been searched.

13:49.996 --> 13:51.038
Isn't that a risk?

13:51.247 --> 13:52.664
We had no choice.

13:52.874 --> 13:55.292
They've gone public
with what happened on level 5.

13:55.502 --> 13:57.586
They're saying you
killed 10 soldiers.

13:57.796 --> 13:58.962
I don't know how much
longer we can

13:59.172 --> 14:00.881
keep this
shell game going.

14:01.090 --> 14:02.966
Did you take out
the acid fog yet?

14:03.176 --> 14:06.720
No. No.
That's why I'm here.

14:06.930 --> 14:08.347
I'm gonna need
another route.

14:08.556 --> 14:09.598
Way ahead of you.

14:09.808 --> 14:10.974
You can get there

14:11.184 --> 14:12.684
through the
retrofit zones.

14:15.730 --> 14:17.397
They're off limits.

14:17.607 --> 14:19.817
No cameras,
no patrols.

14:20.026 --> 14:21.693
We use some
to move the kids.

14:22.904 --> 14:24.530
And that's your
other route.

14:24.739 --> 14:26.114
You're also
gonna need this.

14:26.324 --> 14:27.449
An acetylene torch.

14:29.035 --> 14:31.620
Go to the
northwest corridor.

14:42.090 --> 14:45.384
Indra. Aren't you
supposed to be on watch?

14:45.593 --> 14:46.969
I don't stand post.

14:48.429 --> 14:50.639
Well, um,
where's Octavia?

14:50.849 --> 14:52.975
With Lincoln.
Scouting the Mountain.

15:30.305 --> 15:32.222
Don't move.

15:33.850 --> 15:35.642
I have my orders.

15:35.852 --> 15:37.185
I don't care.

15:37.395 --> 15:39.271
This is
not happening.

15:43.860 --> 15:44.902
Let's go.

16:18.269 --> 16:19.186
It's clearing.

16:38.915 --> 16:39.831
There.

16:41.167 --> 16:43.794
We have the light
and, oh, look.

16:43.962 --> 16:48.006
Footprints are gone.
Sand. It blows.

16:54.931 --> 16:55.931
Do you see that?

17:04.148 --> 17:05.232
The city of light.

17:06.567 --> 17:08.151
Emori was telling
the truth.

17:11.280 --> 17:12.364
We are so close.

17:16.953 --> 17:19.913
You wanted a sign?
There it is.

17:20.123 --> 17:21.873
We have to push forward.

17:22.083 --> 17:23.375
What about
the mines?

17:25.503 --> 17:28.088
We were meant
to be here, John.

17:28.297 --> 17:31.299
These mines, they're just
another test of our faith.

17:33.469 --> 17:38.098
Yeah, well, I was always crap
at tests, so... Please.

17:38.307 --> 17:39.391
After you, chancellor.

17:50.737 --> 17:52.070
Uhh!

17:52.280 --> 17:54.031
You sent him
to kill Octavia?

17:54.240 --> 17:56.033
I told you she's
not a problem.

17:59.203 --> 18:01.121
Leave us.

18:01.330 --> 18:03.331
No. I'm not letting him
out of my sight.

18:06.669 --> 18:08.587
Stand down for now
and wait for my command.

18:13.134 --> 18:14.718
What the hell
is wrong with you?

18:14.927 --> 18:17.637
You can't just kill
everyone you don't trust.

18:17.847 --> 18:18.680
Yes, I can.

18:19.891 --> 18:21.058
Well, I won't
let you.

18:23.311 --> 18:25.187
You were willing
to let her die two days ago.

18:25.396 --> 18:26.772
Nothing has changed.

18:26.981 --> 18:30.192
You're wrong.
I have.

18:30.401 --> 18:31.568
I can't
do this anymore.

18:33.821 --> 18:35.072
Octavia is
a threat.

18:37.450 --> 18:39.618
If you weren't so close
to her, you'd see that.

18:39.827 --> 18:41.953
It's because
I'm close to her

18:42.163 --> 18:43.830
that I know
she's loyal.

18:44.040 --> 18:46.708
Her brother is more important
to her than anyone.

18:46.918 --> 18:49.044
She would never
endanger his life.

18:49.253 --> 18:50.712
And you're willing
to risk everything on that?

18:52.757 --> 18:53.840
On your feelings?

18:54.050 --> 18:55.675
Yes.

18:55.885 --> 18:57.803
You say having feelings
makes me weak.

18:58.012 --> 19:00.680
But you're weak
for hiding from them.

19:00.890 --> 19:03.016
I might be a hypocrite,
Lexa, but you're a liar.

19:04.477 --> 19:06.645
You felt something
for Gustus.

19:06.854 --> 19:09.397
You're still
haunted by Costia.

19:09.607 --> 19:10.524
You want
everyone to think

19:10.733 --> 19:11.525
you're above it all,

19:11.734 --> 19:13.819
but I see
right through you.

19:17.073 --> 19:18.490
Get out.

19:19.826 --> 19:22.369
250 people died
in that village.

19:22.578 --> 19:24.412
I know you felt
for them.

19:24.622 --> 19:25.705
But you let them burn.

19:29.794 --> 19:30.961
Not everyone.

19:33.297 --> 19:34.297
Not you.

19:43.432 --> 19:46.852
Well, if you care
about me, then--trust me.

19:48.187 --> 19:49.521
Octavia's not a threat.

19:54.443 --> 19:55.360
I can't do that.

19:59.240 --> 20:00.991
I can't sacrifice
my people anymore.

20:02.285 --> 20:04.661
If you do anything
to hurt Octavia,

20:04.871 --> 20:06.788
I'll tell everyone
we knew about the missile.

20:53.669 --> 20:55.921
There's no trap.
No trap.

21:01.135 --> 21:04.554
It's 4 mines down,
infinity to go, Jaha.

21:09.477 --> 21:10.602
We will make it, John.

21:12.313 --> 21:13.980
I can't
do this anymore.

21:15.191 --> 21:16.441
Calm down, Richards.

21:19.362 --> 21:21.696
What do you
think it is, anyway?

21:21.906 --> 21:24.157
It must have power.

21:24.367 --> 21:26.409
A shower would be nice
right about now.

21:26.619 --> 21:28.078
Wash off the rest
of Harris.

21:30.706 --> 21:32.582
Sienna said
it's a place

21:32.792 --> 21:34.793
where everyone
is welcome.

21:35.002 --> 21:36.211
That'd be a first,
wouldn't it?

21:39.590 --> 21:41.299
I can't take this.
It's right there!

21:41.509 --> 21:43.551
Hey!
Richards, stop!

21:47.431 --> 21:48.306
Uhh!

22:43.446 --> 22:47.449
Hydrochloric acid.
Sulfuric acid.

22:47.658 --> 22:50.368
Um... Perchloric acid.

22:50.578 --> 22:53.246
Now you're just naming
all the acids you know.

22:53.456 --> 22:55.206
Well, temperature
would be an issue.

22:55.416 --> 22:57.542
Hey, it could be
nitric acid.

22:57.752 --> 22:59.002
Nothing exploded.

22:59.211 --> 23:00.754
Fine. Ruin my fun.

23:02.131 --> 23:03.548
This isn't helping.

23:03.758 --> 23:04.966
Like I said,
we should just

23:05.176 --> 23:06.343
disable the machine
itself.

23:06.552 --> 23:08.928
Any machine like this
has to have safeguards.

23:09.138 --> 23:10.388
They can't keep
a boatload of acid around

23:10.598 --> 23:11.890
without any way
to neutralize it.

23:12.099 --> 23:13.725
It's basic safety protocol.
Let's use that.

23:13.934 --> 23:15.226
Neutralization is
too complicated.

23:15.436 --> 23:17.354
Please. It's a bag of
limestone in the corner.

23:17.563 --> 23:20.940
Here you go again--
big ideas with no follow-through.

23:21.150 --> 23:24.069
I'll have you know
I have great follow-through.

23:48.386 --> 23:51.262
Come in, raven. I made it.

23:51.472 --> 23:52.555
I hope you have a plan.

23:53.724 --> 23:55.433
Still working on it.

23:55.643 --> 23:57.018
Give us something
to go on.

23:57.228 --> 23:58.061
What do you see?

23:58.270 --> 24:00.939
A huge steel vat.

24:01.148 --> 24:02.565
Looks like a submarine.

24:02.775 --> 24:05.735
Some other tanks with
chemical formulas

24:05.945 --> 24:07.862
and warning labels.

24:08.072 --> 24:11.616
Bunch of pipes
running into the wall. Monitor.

24:11.826 --> 24:13.701
Ooh, go
to the monitor.

24:13.911 --> 24:15.161
Hello to you, too.

24:15.371 --> 24:16.830
Don't mind wick.
He's not really helping.

24:18.290 --> 24:20.500
Hey, Bellamy.
How's my boy Monty doing?

24:20.751 --> 24:22.919
Fine. But I don't know
for how long.

24:23.129 --> 24:24.379
Great.
Pleasantries over.

24:24.588 --> 24:26.589
Listen, if that monitor
is a control panel,

24:26.799 --> 24:28.341
we can use it
to kill this thing.

24:28.551 --> 24:29.717
Look for
a PH scale.

24:29.927 --> 24:32.887
Right. It has a scale,
but the rest...

24:33.097 --> 24:36.766
S-3, v-2-0-5,

24:36.976 --> 24:39.477
h-2-s-2-o-7.

24:39.687 --> 24:41.020
Can't I just blow this thing?

24:41.230 --> 24:42.021
- No.
- No, they'll know

24:42.189 --> 24:43.064
their defenses are down.

24:43.274 --> 24:45.108
They'll send a tech
to fix it or reroute it

24:45.317 --> 24:47.402
or pull out some other weapon
we don't even know about.

24:47.611 --> 24:49.195
Plus, you'd probably
melt your face off.

24:52.616 --> 24:54.534
Look, you know I like
a good explosion,

24:54.743 --> 24:56.202
but we gotta think our way
through this one.

24:57.538 --> 24:58.496
We can do this.

25:02.376 --> 25:03.251
Here we go.

25:29.987 --> 25:31.321
Another test passed.

25:36.785 --> 25:38.536
We made it.

25:38.746 --> 25:39.579
Come on.

25:58.974 --> 26:00.225
Are you
kidding me?

26:01.769 --> 26:03.478
Are you kidding me?
This is it?

26:11.820 --> 26:13.696
This is what we
crossed a desert to find?

26:16.367 --> 26:18.493
It can't be.

26:18.702 --> 26:20.537
Well, guess what?
Your enlightened society?

26:20.746 --> 26:22.956
It's not a city.
It's nothing.

26:24.875 --> 26:26.376
I flew down from space.

26:30.172 --> 26:31.339
I defied death.

26:32.675 --> 26:33.758
It was all for a reason.

26:36.303 --> 26:37.220
It has to be.

26:48.482 --> 26:50.191
OK, uh... Level indicator.

26:51.318 --> 26:52.235
Nope.

26:53.988 --> 26:56.531
Do you see
an actuator anywhere?

26:56.740 --> 26:57.865
One must be
controlling the valves.

26:59.743 --> 27:01.452
I have no idea what that is.

27:02.705 --> 27:06.082
Norms.
Come on, what else?

27:06.292 --> 27:08.167
Internal pressure sensor.

27:08.377 --> 27:09.335
No.

27:09.545 --> 27:11.504
Uh, setpoint and alarm.

27:11.714 --> 27:13.673
Let's avoid
that one.

27:13.882 --> 27:15.633
Maintenance and cleaning.

27:15.843 --> 27:16.676
Wait.

27:18.178 --> 27:19.470
Corrosion.

27:19.680 --> 27:20.805
The protective
oxide film would

27:21.015 --> 27:22.724
have to be restored
in tanks this old.

27:22.933 --> 27:24.142
They'd need
to be cleaned.

27:24.351 --> 27:25.393
And neutralized.

27:26.645 --> 27:28.104
Bellamy, go to
that subdirectory.

27:28.314 --> 27:30.315
See if there's anything
there that says "Passivation."

27:32.234 --> 27:33.735
OK. I'm on it.

27:35.904 --> 27:37.614
Got it.

27:39.450 --> 27:42.910
Says, uh, "Aqueous
sodium hydroxide bath."

27:43.120 --> 27:45.496
That's a base. That'll neutralize
the acid. Select that.

27:50.336 --> 27:54.422
It's doing something.

27:54.632 --> 27:56.758
You should
be able to hear the pump.

27:56.967 --> 27:58.009
I can hear them.

28:01.764 --> 28:02.764
Needle's moving.

28:04.141 --> 28:06.851
PH is rising.
It's working.

28:21.742 --> 28:23.326
Passivation success.

28:23.535 --> 28:25.536
Yes!

28:28.957 --> 28:30.917
All right.
Send a flare.

28:33.712 --> 28:34.587
Roger that.

28:40.969 --> 28:42.053
You sent for me?

28:44.139 --> 28:45.014
Yes.

28:46.600 --> 28:48.476
Octavia has nothing
to fear from me.

28:52.690 --> 28:54.691
I do trust you, Clarke.

28:57.528 --> 28:59.445
I know how hard
that is for you.

29:05.536 --> 29:08.705
You think our ways
are harsh,

29:08.914 --> 29:10.373
but that's
how we survive.

29:11.500 --> 29:12.917
Maybe life
should be about

29:13.127 --> 29:14.919
more than
just surviving.

29:16.839 --> 29:18.381
Don't we deserve
better than that?

29:22.720 --> 29:23.845
Maybe we do.

29:49.037 --> 29:50.246
I'm sorry. I--

29:52.291 --> 29:55.001
I'm not ready.
To be with anyone.

29:58.881 --> 29:59.922
Not yet.

30:19.943 --> 30:21.110
Bellamy did it.

30:23.614 --> 30:25.281
You were right
to have faith in him.

30:29.912 --> 30:30.995
Now we fight.

31:06.990 --> 31:09.242
When I said, "Let's get our
stoichiometry on," not what I meant.

31:16.542 --> 31:19.919
Ah. Um, it's probably
a bad idea.

31:20.128 --> 31:22.255
We're going to war.
Stop talking.

31:42.192 --> 31:44.402
I'm just saying,
the brace I made

31:44.611 --> 31:45.653
would've been easier
to take off.

31:47.865 --> 31:49.240
That brace was tragic.

31:50.659 --> 31:52.159
What did I say
about talking, wick?

31:53.537 --> 31:55.204
I think you can
call me Kyle.

33:06.860 --> 33:08.402
Raven, we've got a problem.

33:10.322 --> 33:12.365
Dammit, where are you?

33:12.574 --> 33:14.075
I don't think
the acid fog is down.

33:14.284 --> 33:18.120
Get word to Clarke.
We have to stop the army. Raven!

33:18.330 --> 33:20.790
Confirmed, sir.
Intruder's radio has been cut off.

33:20.999 --> 33:22.750
Raven, what's going on?

33:22.960 --> 33:24.293
Reset the panel.

33:25.629 --> 33:27.129
The army's
almost in range.

33:33.845 --> 33:35.763
Oh.

33:35.973 --> 33:37.515
Good job finding
the radio, lieutenant.

33:39.184 --> 33:41.018
Do a sweep and make
sure they have no more.

33:41.228 --> 33:42.019
Yes, sir.

33:42.229 --> 33:44.105
And bring me
the intruder.

33:58.912 --> 34:00.329
Drop your weapon!

34:13.176 --> 34:15.094
On my lead.

34:15.303 --> 34:16.804
He's armed.
Don't be a hero.

34:20.058 --> 34:22.768
Show yourself.
Hands first.

34:26.565 --> 34:28.941
Cease fire!
Don't hit the tanks.

34:41.538 --> 34:43.873
The veil is ready
on your command, sir.

34:44.082 --> 34:46.625
Wait until they're all
inside at the kill box.

34:46.877 --> 34:48.044
10 more seconds.

34:48.253 --> 34:50.296
Roger that.
Deploying in 10...

34:51.798 --> 34:53.007
9...

34:55.343 --> 34:57.720
8...

34:57.929 --> 34:58.721
7...

34:58.930 --> 35:00.222
He's out.

35:00.432 --> 35:02.266
You go after him.
We'll check the tanks.

35:02.476 --> 35:05.311
6... 5...

35:06.813 --> 35:07.855
4...

35:10.192 --> 35:11.067
3...

35:13.528 --> 35:15.571
2...1.

35:17.449 --> 35:18.532
We're go for veil.

36:05.872 --> 36:07.498
Well?

36:07.707 --> 36:09.875
We are negative on
veil deployment.

36:10.085 --> 36:11.585
What happened?

36:11.795 --> 36:14.296
Soldiers report an explosion in
chemicals deployment.

36:14.506 --> 36:16.465
Multiple casualties.

36:16.675 --> 36:18.509
The veil is down.
I repeat, the veil is down.

36:18.718 --> 36:19.969
What else
can we use?

36:20.178 --> 36:22.221
The reapers can't take
a force this large.

36:22.430 --> 36:24.515
Don't tell me what we can't do.

36:24.724 --> 36:26.183
Tell me what else
we have.

36:28.687 --> 36:31.480
Nothing. All we have
is the doors.

37:11.021 --> 37:11.896
Hey.

37:15.442 --> 37:16.775
We have to meet
the strike team.

37:19.362 --> 37:23.157
You kind of, ahem, shut down
on me there. What's up?

37:25.410 --> 37:27.036
What?

37:27.245 --> 37:28.078
Nothing.

37:32.584 --> 37:33.751
Right.

37:35.754 --> 37:36.754
This was too much.

37:44.221 --> 37:45.095
Look...

37:47.557 --> 37:48.891
If you want to do this,
I'm in.

37:51.061 --> 37:52.519
But I'm not
gonna play games.

37:52.729 --> 37:53.562
So, figure it out.

38:03.281 --> 38:04.406
We have a war to win.

38:31.559 --> 38:32.434
Hey.

38:34.437 --> 38:35.312
What do you want?

38:37.816 --> 38:39.066
I'm changing
your mission.

38:39.276 --> 38:41.318
You're not going to
the mines with Indra.

38:41.528 --> 38:43.028
I'm placing you
in the rear guard,

38:43.238 --> 38:44.613
where you'll be safe.

38:44.823 --> 38:46.865
Like hell you are.
I don't take orders from you.

38:47.075 --> 38:48.325
I take orders
from Indra.

38:48.535 --> 38:50.077
I'm trying to protect
you, Octavia.

38:50.287 --> 38:52.288
Protect me.

38:52.497 --> 38:54.581
One day, hopefully,
you'll understand what I did.

38:54.791 --> 38:57.001
Never. I'll fight
this war with you now

38:57.210 --> 38:59.295
because I want
our friends back.

38:59.504 --> 39:00.504
But after that,
we're done.

39:06.928 --> 39:08.387
The commander's
looking for you.

39:12.350 --> 39:14.101
What was that about?

39:14.311 --> 39:16.020
Clarke's trying to
reassign me to the rear guard.

39:17.147 --> 39:18.272
You're a warrior.

39:18.481 --> 39:19.606
You'll be in
the mines with me.

39:21.276 --> 39:23.068
I know what bothers you.

39:23.278 --> 39:25.070
They knew about
the missile.

39:25.280 --> 39:26.864
How could you
not hate them?

39:27.073 --> 39:28.157
Indra, they almost
killed you.

39:28.366 --> 39:30.951
They didn't do anything.
The enemy did.

39:31.161 --> 39:34.163
Lexa's a great commander
because she's ruthless.

39:34.372 --> 39:35.873
That's why we'll
win this battle.

39:36.082 --> 39:37.291
That's wrong.

39:37.500 --> 39:39.376
That's war.

39:39.586 --> 39:41.420
Yaaah!

39:48.720 --> 39:50.596
Yaaah!

40:05.862 --> 40:07.321
What a joke.

40:10.992 --> 40:12.618
It doesn't make any sense.

40:12.827 --> 40:15.287
The rest of
the world is broken,

40:15.497 --> 40:17.247
but these panels
are intact.

40:17.457 --> 40:18.624
Well, we can
fix that.

40:20.543 --> 40:22.336
John.

40:29.928 --> 40:30.886
What the hell is that?

40:33.640 --> 40:35.099
It's a drone.

40:35.308 --> 40:36.392
Don't lose
sight of it.

40:56.246 --> 40:57.037
Where's it
going?

40:57.247 --> 40:58.080
I don't know...

40:59.207 --> 41:00.499
But we're gonna follow it.

41:00.708 --> 41:02.584
In this.

41:02.794 --> 41:05.504
Tell me, what level of crazy
is too much for you?

41:05.713 --> 41:06.713
I'm just curious.

41:10.301 --> 41:14.388
We need a boat...
And a boat appears.

41:14.597 --> 41:15.722
This is our destiny.

41:16.933 --> 41:18.142
The city of light
is out there

41:18.351 --> 41:19.309
and we are gonna
find it.

41:21.020 --> 41:22.062
Now, get in
the boat.

41:26.985 --> 41:28.110
You heard the man.
