00:03.000 --> 00:04.333
(Ryan)
Previously on Mech-X4...

00:04.375 --> 00:07.709
Cassie Park, streaming live on Gramogram.
And are you seeing this?

00:07.792 --> 00:09.291
Why not have Bay City's best

00:09.375 --> 00:11.250
digital reporter
announce my scholarship?

00:11.333 --> 00:13.792
The Harper Grant
for Young Futurists.

00:13.875 --> 00:14.959
You're the smartest
guy I know.

00:15.041 --> 00:17.500
(Ryan)
You did all of this in two days?

00:17.583 --> 00:20.917
(Harris) Plus, I designed an app
that scans news feeds for monsters.

00:21.000 --> 00:23.792
Leo implanted a receiver chip
in his brain.

00:23.875 --> 00:26.000
I can send a pulse out
that will tell me where he is.

00:26.083 --> 00:28.750
(Mastermind) And now you know
there's no possibility of escape.

00:28.834 --> 00:30.792
And no one can find you here.

00:30.875 --> 00:32.125
Ah!

00:32.208 --> 00:33.500
(All)
Hurt locker!

00:34.792 --> 00:36.792
Man, we really stuck it
to the newbies this year!

00:42.250 --> 00:46.458
So instead of figuring out
how to get to Leo,

00:46.542 --> 00:48.834
you've been working on
a science fair project?

00:48.917 --> 00:51.542
First, it's the final selection
for the Harper Grant.

00:51.625 --> 00:53.709
Not a science fair.
Respect the game.

00:53.792 --> 00:56.500
And, I'm doing both
at the same time.

00:56.583 --> 00:59.208
Check this out,
the power amplifier I created.

00:59.291 --> 01:02.125
It can manipulate any kind
of power source from any distance.

01:03.583 --> 01:04.834
Increase.

01:04.917 --> 01:07.709
(power humming)

01:07.792 --> 01:09.709
Decrease.

01:09.792 --> 01:11.542
Whatever you want.

01:11.625 --> 01:14.542
So, I win the grant
using this bad boy.

01:14.625 --> 01:18.250
Use Harper's tech to miniaturize all this
into a wristband.

01:18.333 --> 01:21.250
-Patent. Make it rain.
-(cash register dings)

01:21.333 --> 01:25.583
-I marry Selena Gomez.
-(wedding bells chime)

01:25.667 --> 01:27.291
And when do we find Leo?

01:27.375 --> 01:30.166
Using everything I'd have at my disposal
at Harper Futuristics?

01:30.250 --> 01:32.667
Five minutes after I walk in there.

01:32.750 --> 01:36.375
Yeah, but first I gotta find tech
to give Mech-X4 a submarine mode.

01:36.458 --> 01:38.625
Oh, yeah, I also designed
a submode.

01:38.709 --> 01:40.834
All these parts will be at Mech-X3.

01:40.917 --> 01:42.333
Which is where I'll be
if you need me.

01:42.417 --> 01:45.583
And, uh, good luck
at your... nerd-off.

01:46.583 --> 01:49.083
It's not a competition,
even if it was...

01:49.166 --> 01:52.125
all I need to do is be
the biggest brain in the room.

01:53.375 --> 01:55.959
(Man) You are the biggest brain
in the room.

01:56.041 --> 02:00.667
And this is a "Micronized
Time/Space Nullpoint?"

02:00.750 --> 02:04.959
Yeah, for the live studio
audience: a black hole in a box.

02:06.417 --> 02:10.041
Well, how is the second smartest kid
in Bay City doing?

02:11.083 --> 02:12.542
Totally a competition.

02:12.625 --> 02:15.041
Second smartest?

02:15.125 --> 02:18.750
I'd say last year's chess championship
says otherwise, Veracity.

02:18.834 --> 02:22.834
Yeah, but I won the year before,
so technically we're tied, hair-bear.

02:22.917 --> 02:25.667
Well, Mark was right.
It's a nerd-off, run.

02:25.750 --> 02:28.500
(Spyder) Run! Run!

02:37.750 --> 02:40.000
(theme music playing)

02:59.917 --> 03:02.583
Ugh! I'm so tired
of this waiting.

03:02.667 --> 03:04.458
We're so close to getting
that Leo guy

03:04.542 --> 03:05.917
and finally getting
some answers.

03:06.000 --> 03:07.458
Dude, be patient. Huh?

03:07.542 --> 03:08.917
Weird.

03:09.000 --> 03:11.333
Yeah, me telling someone
to be patient

03:11.417 --> 03:13.625
is like a shark telling somebody
not to go swimming.

03:13.709 --> 03:15.750
No, I mean that.

03:15.834 --> 03:18.500
Is that supposed to be Mech-X4?

03:19.959 --> 03:21.250
Weird.

03:25.000 --> 03:26.166
Yeah.

03:27.542 --> 03:29.542
Hey, bud... Hey, buddy, buddy.

03:29.625 --> 03:31.667
There you go.

03:31.750 --> 03:32.917
There you go, buddy.

03:34.250 --> 03:37.458
-Whoa, a Mech-X4 fan club?
-Let's check it out.

03:37.542 --> 03:40.834
Fans? Hey, do you think we'd get groupies
if they know who the pilots were.

03:40.917 --> 03:43.125
Hey, nobody said anything
about pilots.

03:43.208 --> 03:46.792
Uh... Psh, you know, anything.

03:46.875 --> 03:49.583
-Just be cool.
-I'm cool.

03:50.375 --> 03:53.000
Where are my Mech-heads at? Whoo!

03:53.083 --> 03:54.959
-(Guy) Yeah!
-(Girl) Yeah!

03:55.041 --> 03:56.625
Hm.

03:59.250 --> 04:01.166
Whoa.

04:01.250 --> 04:02.667
Look at all these people.

04:02.750 --> 04:07.166
We got freshmen, seniors,
that guy.

04:08.959 --> 04:10.250
How great is this?

04:12.667 --> 04:15.625
Weird, what is this?

04:15.709 --> 04:20.458
Why would someone draw Mech-X4 as a
bunch of mechanical cats linked together?

04:20.542 --> 04:23.333
"Sentient cars from outer space?"
What is this?

04:24.333 --> 04:25.834
It's the theory wall.

04:25.917 --> 04:28.375
We all have our own idea
about what Mech-X4 is.

04:29.709 --> 04:33.667
Me? I think he's a 150-foot tall
alien in a battlesuit.

04:33.750 --> 04:36.625
Shunned by his people,
here to protect us.

04:39.208 --> 04:40.917
I think there's
magic involved.

04:42.875 --> 04:44.458
This is awesome.

04:44.542 --> 04:48.125
Uh, Ryan? Did you say
"pilot" outside?

04:48.208 --> 04:49.542
What up, girl?

04:49.625 --> 04:51.792
You in this club?
Oh, my...

04:51.875 --> 04:53.500
I'm a digital journalist.

04:53.583 --> 04:56.041
This is a club for kids
who wear boxes on their heads.

04:57.375 --> 05:00.458
Now, I could have sworn
you said something about a pilot.

05:00.542 --> 05:02.041
What?

05:02.125 --> 05:03.125
No!

05:03.208 --> 05:05.083
You heard wrong.

05:05.166 --> 05:08.750
Did I? Because the idea
Mech-X4 has a pilot

05:08.834 --> 05:11.792
makes a pretty solid angle
for a story.

05:11.875 --> 05:13.333
Well, we got to go.

05:13.417 --> 05:15.333
Hey, hey, hey.
But do we?

05:15.417 --> 05:17.875
Because... (whispers) I almost
started shaving.

05:19.250 --> 05:20.250
My back.

05:21.000 --> 05:22.000
Gross.

05:22.083 --> 05:23.792
Did I hear something
about pilots?

05:23.875 --> 05:26.041
Nobody's ever thought
about there being pilots.

05:26.834 --> 05:28.750
Yes, we gotta go before
someone else mentions...

05:28.834 --> 05:31.834
(Langley) Attention! I call
this meeting to order.

05:31.917 --> 05:34.750
Our newest member
has a theory.

05:34.834 --> 05:36.291
(students chattering)

05:36.375 --> 05:38.166
Mm.

05:38.250 --> 05:41.458
(Man over PA) Day one at the Harper Grant
Regionals concludes at five o'clock.

05:41.542 --> 05:45.250
Semi-finalists will be notified via text
if they move on to tomorrow's finals.

05:45.333 --> 05:47.792
Also, tomorrow's lunch
is fish sticks.

05:47.875 --> 05:49.917
That's... that's pretty amazing.

05:50.000 --> 05:51.625
Don't.

05:51.709 --> 05:53.250
Don't what?

05:53.333 --> 05:56.625
How long have we been doing this?
Since preschool?

05:56.709 --> 05:58.208
My brain is fast and furious

05:58.291 --> 06:00.750
and you know that I can deal
with the outcome of any situation.

06:00.834 --> 06:02.875
(scoffs) So how does
this all play out?

06:02.959 --> 06:05.709
Simple. We compete, I win.

06:05.792 --> 06:07.667
-And?
-And the end.

06:07.750 --> 06:10.750
The credits are rolling and there is no
bonus scene for the next movie.

06:10.834 --> 06:13.041
So, finish your nut clusters
and go home.

06:13.125 --> 06:15.250
Well, I'm gonna bust
some predictions on you.

06:15.333 --> 06:16.667
What are you geeks
doing in here?

06:16.750 --> 06:18.417
This is varsity territory.

06:18.500 --> 06:19.917
Not today and tomorrow.

06:20.000 --> 06:23.709
Thanks to a generous donation
from the Harper Futuristics Foundation.

06:23.792 --> 06:26.250
Nobody warned us there was
gonna be nerd prom in our gym.

06:26.333 --> 06:27.375
-Oh!
-Oh! All right.

06:27.458 --> 06:29.375
Look, jockstrap.

06:29.458 --> 06:32.542
Let me tell you how this is
all gonna work out. You leave.

06:32.625 --> 06:33.625
Time passes.

06:33.709 --> 06:37.333
And in ten years, when I order
a chai soy latte,

06:37.417 --> 06:39.667
and you bring me
a half-caf flat white...

06:39.750 --> 06:41.125
You get the order wrong.

06:41.208 --> 06:42.750
...I report you
to the manager.

06:42.834 --> 06:44.375
-Probably this guy.
-Unnecessary.

06:44.458 --> 06:45.959
And he fires you. Oh!

06:46.041 --> 06:48.875
No Christmas presents
under the tree for Jockstrap, Junior.

06:48.959 --> 06:49.959
But...

06:50.959 --> 06:51.917
-I...
-Uh.

06:52.000 --> 06:53.875
-Mm-hmm.
-I will so...

06:53.959 --> 06:55.917
provide for my family.
Come on.

06:56.000 --> 06:58.208
Let's find some other
kids to pick on.

06:59.208 --> 07:01.250
Man, we destroyed him.

07:02.291 --> 07:03.709
We in a frat now?

07:03.792 --> 07:05.250
No.

07:18.542 --> 07:19.875
(Ryan)
Hm.

07:19.959 --> 07:21.792
The theory behind Mech-X4.

07:21.875 --> 07:24.917
So what could Mech-X4 be?

07:26.000 --> 07:27.333
Um...

07:30.750 --> 07:32.583
Uh...

07:35.291 --> 07:37.083
-Well...
-Hi.

07:40.083 --> 07:41.750
Um...

07:41.834 --> 07:43.792
You said "pilot."

07:43.875 --> 07:47.083
Did I? I think I said pirates.

07:48.458 --> 07:50.250
Yeah, why not a pirate?

07:50.333 --> 07:53.834
So, like, what if this
cannon arm has...

07:55.041 --> 07:59.625
a hook instead of a plasma fist?

07:59.709 --> 08:00.792
Plasma fist?

08:00.875 --> 08:03.000
That is a great name
for that weapon.

08:03.083 --> 08:05.375
It beats the pants
off of sparkle fist.

08:06.333 --> 08:07.917
I like sparkle fist.

08:08.917 --> 08:09.959
You guys gotta bounce.

08:10.041 --> 08:12.750
Since you took my gym
for science,

08:12.834 --> 08:15.375
I'm taking this room for,
well, not science.

08:16.750 --> 08:19.000
And what if I said no?

08:19.083 --> 08:20.417
(Students)
Ooh.

08:20.500 --> 08:22.125
Standing up to varsity. I...

08:22.208 --> 08:25.000
-Respect it?
-No.

08:25.875 --> 08:28.875
I have to make an example.
So this club is done.

08:30.125 --> 08:32.291
-Pack it, geeks.
-(students groan)

08:32.375 --> 08:33.834
Not cool, Dane.

08:33.917 --> 08:36.125
But I like your
pilot theory, kid.

08:36.208 --> 08:37.875
I'll be sure to follow up on that.

08:37.959 --> 08:40.834
-Bye.
-Guess it's back to the tuba for me.

08:40.917 --> 08:42.000
So gross.

08:44.458 --> 08:45.792
Bummer, dude.

08:46.875 --> 08:48.458
Those kids were our fans.

08:48.542 --> 08:50.500
Even if they didn't know it.

08:50.583 --> 08:56.500
No. No, there's no way that we let Dane
tell them that they can't have their club.

08:56.583 --> 08:58.500
What are we gonna do about it?

08:58.583 --> 09:00.750
Us? Not much.

09:00.834 --> 09:03.542
But Mech-X4, a lot.

09:04.709 --> 09:05.875
(Mark)
Hold on, dingus.

09:05.959 --> 09:07.667
(tool whirring)

09:07.750 --> 09:10.083
Well, of course Dane was a jerk,
that's sort of his thing.

09:10.166 --> 09:12.834
He's your friend.
I'm just trying to give you a heads up.

09:12.917 --> 09:16.500
(Mark) Look, I am still at Mech-X3
looking for subparts.

09:16.583 --> 09:18.458
I started tinkering with the Markmobile.

09:18.542 --> 09:21.208
-Markmobile?
-He calls it the Markmobile.

09:21.291 --> 09:24.500
And now I'm neck-deep
in car parts and robot parts.

09:24.583 --> 09:26.875
Whatever your beef is with Dane,
handle it.

09:28.291 --> 09:30.792
"Handle it."
Did you hear what I heard?

09:31.625 --> 09:33.959
We are good to go for vengeance.

09:34.041 --> 09:37.083
Are you sure you're not just frustrated
we can't get to Leo yet

09:37.166 --> 09:39.291
and you're transferring all that
frustration onto a small

09:39.375 --> 09:41.041
but harmless problem
we can solve?

09:41.125 --> 09:42.291
What?

09:42.375 --> 09:44.250
Yeah, I don't know where that
came from. Vengeance!

09:44.333 --> 09:45.458
Whoo!

10:02.750 --> 10:06.000
Good night, second place
to Mark football trophy.

10:07.458 --> 10:10.083
Good night, second place
to Mark baseball trophy.

10:12.667 --> 10:16.375
Good night, girl across the street
who wants nothing to do with me.

10:20.875 --> 10:22.041
(alarm blares)

10:26.041 --> 10:27.333
(thud)

10:29.333 --> 10:30.542
Dane.

10:31.834 --> 10:33.083
Dane.

10:33.166 --> 10:35.208
Ah! Ah!

10:35.291 --> 10:37.291
Look outside, Dane.

10:37.375 --> 10:38.792
Dane.

10:40.458 --> 10:42.583
(screams)

10:42.667 --> 10:44.709
Don't hurt me!

10:44.792 --> 10:47.208
(screaming)

10:47.291 --> 10:49.375
Hey, hey! Don't squish him.

10:49.458 --> 10:52.375
If I wanted to squish him,
I would squish him.

10:53.834 --> 10:56.083
-Nah.
-Nah. Yeah, I will put him down now.

10:58.875 --> 11:00.750
Ah! Ah!

11:02.625 --> 11:03.834
What do you want?

11:03.917 --> 11:05.583
(distorted voice)
You know why I'm here.

11:05.667 --> 11:08.500
(Dane) For putting cellophane
on all the toilets?

11:08.583 --> 11:09.917
No, not that.

11:11.375 --> 11:14.417
Filling that Spyder kid's
stupid hat with macaroni?

11:14.500 --> 11:16.125
That was delicious.

11:16.208 --> 11:17.750
Not that.

11:17.834 --> 11:20.500
Those nerds I kicked out
of the student lounge?

11:20.583 --> 11:21.750
No.

11:23.500 --> 11:24.917
Yes! Yes!

11:25.000 --> 11:28.542
There are forces at work
beyond your comprehension, Dane.

11:28.625 --> 11:29.875
That club is a part of it.

11:29.959 --> 11:31.333
That lame club?

11:31.417 --> 11:33.750
It doesn't even have
the good Walker brother in it.

11:33.834 --> 11:35.458
Ryan's cool.

11:35.542 --> 11:36.959
Ryan's cool.

11:37.041 --> 11:38.250
No, man!

11:38.333 --> 11:39.375
Ugh, okay.

11:39.458 --> 11:42.166
I need you to give them their room back
and leave them alone.

11:42.250 --> 11:43.792
But they're so just...

11:47.083 --> 11:48.792
(screams)

11:49.709 --> 11:51.875
(car alarms blaring)

11:55.417 --> 11:56.917
Sorry, I got bored.

11:58.333 --> 12:00.417
(mechanical whooshing)

12:00.500 --> 12:03.834
(screaming)

12:13.083 --> 12:16.417
Okay. All you jocks, you're out.

12:16.500 --> 12:18.041
All my awesome new friends, you're in.

12:18.125 --> 12:19.500
(confused chatter)

12:20.750 --> 12:22.250
(excited chatter)

12:23.959 --> 12:26.917
Um, don't you have
a meeting to start?

12:27.000 --> 12:29.667
I believe this meeting's
now called to order.

12:29.750 --> 12:31.458
(cheering)

12:40.542 --> 12:42.458
Hey, made it past
the first round.

12:42.542 --> 12:43.875
Bribe someone?

12:43.959 --> 12:46.667
Huh... shouldn't be
throwing off energy like that.

12:49.041 --> 12:51.709
Hey. Hey, hey,
hey, sweater-vest.

12:51.792 --> 12:54.291
Your garage sale of an experiment
is doing something to mine.

12:54.375 --> 12:56.834
Really? Because my energy
was amplifying fine

12:56.917 --> 12:59.125
until you brought in
your participation trophy.

12:59.208 --> 13:00.834
Hi.

13:00.917 --> 13:02.667
Oh, nothing to see here.

13:02.750 --> 13:07.291
No, just science.
Got perfectly working science.

13:07.375 --> 13:10.458
Okay, so clearly,
your power amplifier is...

13:10.542 --> 13:14.208
Drawing energy to your black hole
in a box, making it malfunction.

13:14.291 --> 13:15.959
We need to figure out
how to stop it.

13:17.834 --> 13:19.542
Oh, this is bad.

13:19.625 --> 13:22.083
This is like...
This is like blow-up-the-city bad.

13:31.709 --> 13:33.792
I have an idea.
We need to get these outside.

13:33.875 --> 13:34.875
How's that gonna help?

13:34.959 --> 13:37.208
Oh, I guess you don't
know everything, do ya?

13:41.291 --> 13:44.625
I am psyched we got
our club space back.

13:44.709 --> 13:46.709
I really hate this tuba.

13:46.792 --> 13:48.667
Yeah, me too.

13:48.750 --> 13:51.792
Oh, uh, about the club space,
not your tuba.

13:51.875 --> 13:53.166
(phone chiming)

13:55.250 --> 13:57.834
"Emergency.
Get our friend and meet outside"?

14:01.500 --> 14:03.792
Hey, we need to get to Mech-X4...

14:03.875 --> 14:07.333
What's wrong? What was that text?
Is it Mech-X4?

14:07.417 --> 14:10.125
Uh, why would
Mech-X4 be texting me?

14:10.208 --> 14:12.333
Well, 'cause he knew your name.
He said you were cool.

14:12.417 --> 14:13.750
So I'm sticking with you.

14:13.834 --> 14:17.375
Dane and Brandon forever.
Best buds.

14:17.458 --> 14:20.750
Yeah, I don't think the robot
would want that. Trust me.

14:20.834 --> 14:23.083
So you do know him?

14:23.166 --> 14:25.250
Look, just let me help.
If I help, he'll like me.

14:25.333 --> 14:27.709
And not try to blow me up, right?

14:27.792 --> 14:30.166
I'm not trying to say
I know what the robot wants.

14:30.250 --> 14:33.208
But I have an idea on how you can help.

14:33.291 --> 14:34.583
Come on.

14:36.166 --> 14:38.250
Okay, cool, so what's the plan?

14:38.333 --> 14:39.542
You stay here.

14:40.875 --> 14:44.125
Hey! Stay here?
It's a room full of drama stuff.

14:51.917 --> 14:53.500
Am I allowed to sit?

14:53.583 --> 14:55.250
(vacuum cleaner whirring)

14:57.542 --> 14:59.166
I'm at Mech-X3.

14:59.250 --> 15:01.583
Okay, is your car working yet?
I need to get to Mech-X4

15:01.667 --> 15:03.083
and I don't think bikes
are gonna cut it.

15:05.208 --> 15:06.875
Yeah.

15:08.750 --> 15:10.250
It works.

15:12.583 --> 15:14.500
Where are you off to, Ryan?

15:14.583 --> 15:17.291
-Now's not really a good time.
-Oh, this won't take long.

15:17.375 --> 15:21.375
Just tell me how long have you been
the pilot of Mech-X4?

15:25.166 --> 15:26.750
(both laughing)

15:28.125 --> 15:30.792
-You think I'm the pilot of Mech-X4?
-Yeah.

15:30.875 --> 15:32.625
-Why would you think that?
-Right?

15:32.709 --> 15:35.000
I overhear you say
Mech-X4 has pilots.

15:35.083 --> 15:36.792
Hey, nobody said anything
about a pilot.

15:36.875 --> 15:38.250
You get nervous.

15:38.333 --> 15:40.458
Dane picks on Mech-X4's fan club...

15:40.542 --> 15:41.750
Pack it, geeks.

15:41.834 --> 15:43.709
...then gets a visit from Mech-X4.

15:43.792 --> 15:46.583
Then suddenly,
you and Dane are best buds.

15:46.667 --> 15:49.625
Dane and Brandon forever.
Best buds.

15:49.709 --> 15:52.792
You know what they say,
when there's smoke, there's...

15:52.875 --> 15:54.166
-(Man) Fire!
-(alarm ringing)

15:54.250 --> 15:56.333
Not fire! But run! Run!

15:56.417 --> 15:57.709
Everybody run!

15:57.792 --> 16:00.959
But in an orderly fashion.
But run!

16:01.041 --> 16:02.417
-Yeah, so I'm gonna...
-We gotta go.

16:03.792 --> 16:05.750
-Not over Ryan.
-She knows your name.

16:05.834 --> 16:07.417
-That's not a good thing.
-Of course it is.

16:09.834 --> 16:14.125
This is Cassie Park streaming live
from Bay City High.

16:14.208 --> 16:17.000
How could Mark possibly
get from Mech-X3 to here in...

16:34.166 --> 16:35.834
(Ryan)
We're never gonna make it.

16:35.917 --> 16:37.208
Why are you stopping?

16:37.291 --> 16:39.792
(Mark) Relax, dingus.
Nobody can see us.

16:39.875 --> 16:41.375
This is what I did today.

16:53.208 --> 16:55.458
Yeah. Let's do it.

17:00.667 --> 17:01.875
(Ryan) Gonna hurl!

17:03.667 --> 17:05.667
(panicked shouts)

17:05.750 --> 17:08.291
(Veracity) Okay, not a lot of time,
Benedict Cumbersome.

17:08.375 --> 17:12.583
Whatever you are planning,
you should probably do it now.

17:16.041 --> 17:17.500
Whoa.

17:17.583 --> 17:20.458
-How did you know?
-The robot saved the school before.

17:20.542 --> 17:22.166
I had a hunch he'd be here.

17:25.083 --> 17:27.417
-Wow.
-I hope he uses sparkle fist.

17:28.291 --> 17:29.458
Grappling grip!

17:30.375 --> 17:31.458
Ready when you are.

17:35.458 --> 17:36.709
(Kid)
Whoa!

17:38.750 --> 17:40.083
Hit it.

17:40.166 --> 17:41.375
Say goodbye, science.

17:51.083 --> 17:52.667
-Nice!
-Yeah!

17:52.750 --> 17:55.125
Okay, I still gotta deal
with the Cassie part about this.

17:55.208 --> 17:57.000
Heh, the Cassie part?

17:57.083 --> 17:58.583
We do stuff.

18:00.458 --> 18:02.333
(chuckles)

18:02.417 --> 18:04.875
-Oh... okay.
-(Veracity clears throat)

18:05.000 --> 18:07.750
Man, that robot is great, right?

18:11.291 --> 18:13.417
Uh... you're here?

18:13.500 --> 18:15.166
And not in the robot?

18:15.250 --> 18:16.834
Do I look like a pirate?

18:19.208 --> 18:21.166
(Girl) Come on, come on,
we gotta get a selfie.

18:22.667 --> 18:25.333
-It's too big.
-Just snap it before it takes off.

18:30.959 --> 18:32.166
(camera shutter clicks)

18:34.291 --> 18:35.709
(Cassie)
No, wait, wait!

18:37.083 --> 18:39.166
I just want to know the truth.

18:39.250 --> 18:42.542
About monsters, about why you're here.
About...

18:53.291 --> 18:55.792
He's getting pretty good at
controlling this robot from a distance.

18:55.875 --> 18:57.458
You should have seen how good
he's gotten

18:57.542 --> 19:00.625
at scaring the pajamas
off your varsity friend, Dane.

19:00.709 --> 19:02.083
What?

19:02.166 --> 19:03.208
Oh, no, no, I mean...

19:03.291 --> 19:05.500
(stammers)

19:05.583 --> 19:06.834
Yeah.

19:08.500 --> 19:10.250
Ugh, square one.

19:14.125 --> 19:17.709
-I will figure out what's going on here.
-Good luck.

19:21.083 --> 19:22.375
(school bell rings)

19:24.917 --> 19:26.792
(chattering)

19:37.458 --> 19:40.000
(groans) Stay a member of the club?

19:40.083 --> 19:43.000
Pfft, I'm already in a club.

19:43.083 --> 19:45.834
They're about to announce
the winner of the Harper Grant.

19:45.917 --> 19:47.959
I can't open it. You open it.

19:52.291 --> 19:54.208
Oh, man, I'm sorry.

19:54.291 --> 19:55.291
I lost?

19:55.375 --> 19:58.959
No, you won, but so did I.

19:59.041 --> 20:00.208
Seriously?

20:00.291 --> 20:02.500
Yup, we both won.

20:02.583 --> 20:07.166
For helping to save Bay City High...

20:07.250 --> 20:09.375
from your garbage science.

20:10.500 --> 20:12.625
Catch you around the lab, Sparky.

20:12.709 --> 20:14.166
(groans) Just kiss already.

20:14.250 --> 20:15.625
-Inappropriate.
-Weak.

20:15.709 --> 20:16.917
(sarcastically) Sorry.

20:19.500 --> 20:22.125
Good news is,
once I get to Harper's,

20:22.208 --> 20:24.959
I know I can get us everything we need
to find Leo.

20:25.041 --> 20:26.959
Cool.

20:27.041 --> 20:30.083
Why do I keep on thinking
that we forgot something?

20:32.291 --> 20:33.542
Hello?

20:35.625 --> 20:37.375
Guys, can I come out yet?

20:39.291 --> 20:42.250
(Dane)
Guys? Guys?

20:51.583 --> 20:53.291
(students chattering)

21:19.959 --> 21:21.834
(theme music playing)

21:43.875 --> 21:45.166
(barks)
