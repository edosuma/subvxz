10:07.101 --> 10:09.434
Betty: You're very
unpopular this morning.

10:09.470 --> 10:11.436
They're all from
Ronald Sturgis and pals,

10:11.438 --> 10:13.655
those religious weirdos
who've been hanging out

10:13.691 --> 10:15.190
in the lobby this whole week.

10:15.242 --> 10:16.842
What happened to you?

10:16.877 --> 10:19.845
William: [ Groans ]
Tripped up on my own front step.

10:19.880 --> 10:21.246
Betty: Let me fix it.

10:21.281 --> 10:23.081
William: No, I don't want anyone
touching my--

10:23.117 --> 10:25.333
- Aah! God.
Betty: - Oh.

10:25.369 --> 10:27.669
William: Betty, don't--

10:27.705 --> 10:29.788
The vertebral column
is very sensitive. You can't--

10:29.840 --> 10:31.456
Betty: Do you want the pain
to go away?

10:31.508 --> 10:32.624
Trust me, I know what I'm doing.

10:32.676 --> 10:34.009
Helen's got sciatica,

10:34.044 --> 10:35.877
and she's too vain
to give up high heels.

10:35.929 --> 10:37.379
Now just lean back.

10:37.431 --> 10:39.848
William: I most certainly will n--
Aaaaah!

10:39.883 --> 10:41.099
Aah!

10:41.135 --> 10:42.601
Ah! Betty! Stop!

10:42.636 --> 10:44.269
Betty: All right,
let your spine stretch out.

10:44.304 --> 10:45.470
William: Stop it, Betty!
I mean it!

10:45.522 --> 10:46.855
Betty: Sometimes you
can actually feel

10:46.890 --> 10:48.473
- the vertebra pop back in--
William: - I mean it!

10:48.475 --> 10:49.841
- [ Bones pop ]
- Ohh!

10:49.877 --> 10:53.028
Betty: Oh. Ooh.

10:53.063 --> 10:54.146
William: Oh.

10:54.198 --> 10:56.481

10:56.533 --> 10:58.450
William: - Oh, you did it.
Betty: - Yeah.

10:58.485 --> 11:01.536
William: Oh. Oh, Betty.

11:01.572 --> 11:07.659
Oh.
That is absolutely...

11:09.496 --> 11:10.962
Doug.

11:10.998 --> 11:14.082
Fitzhugh: I was... hoping to have
a word with you, Bill.

11:14.134 --> 11:17.335
I'd appreciate a few moments
of your time.

11:17.371 --> 11:18.837
William: Of course.

11:18.872 --> 11:20.772
Thank you, Betty.
That'll be all.

11:22.543 --> 11:26.011
Fitzhugh: Look, I feel awful about
what happened the other week.

11:26.046 --> 11:28.113
Seeing you
at that cocktail party,

11:28.148 --> 11:31.650
it brought back some--
well, some strong emotions.

11:31.685 --> 11:33.852
For you, too, I'm sure.

11:33.887 --> 11:36.488
The truth of the matter is,

11:36.523 --> 11:40.525
it's been 10 years since...
the unpleasantness between us.

11:40.527 --> 11:43.361
And clearly, you've gone on to
some impressive accomplishments.

11:43.413 --> 11:44.780
You've got your own practice,

11:44.832 --> 11:47.032
you've got a best-selling book
on your hands.

11:47.034 --> 11:50.285
I think it's high time
that you and I bury the hatchet.

11:50.337 --> 11:51.570
Don't you think?

11:54.575 --> 11:56.208
William: Well...

11:56.243 --> 12:01.313
that's quite a change of heart
you've had, Doug, haven't you?

12:01.348 --> 12:04.082
Fitzhugh:
I've given it a lot of thought.

12:04.151 --> 12:05.784
William:
In the space of two weeks,

12:05.819 --> 12:07.919
to go from publicly insulting
a man,

12:07.955 --> 12:11.223
calling his integrity
into question,

12:11.275 --> 12:14.142
demeaning his work,

12:14.194 --> 12:17.395
to this... display.

12:20.284 --> 12:23.485
There wouldn't be any ulterior
motives here, would there, Doug?

12:27.074 --> 12:28.874
Fitzhugh: Hmm.

12:31.078 --> 12:33.628
You have a son, don't you, Bill?

12:33.664 --> 12:36.081
I'm sure you would do anything
in the world for him,

12:36.133 --> 12:37.883
wouldn't you?

12:40.053 --> 12:42.254
Ronnie is an architect.

12:42.256 --> 12:46.091
Two years ago, he married
a sweet girl, Leelah.

12:46.143 --> 12:48.343
They've been trying
to have a baby. No luck.

12:48.395 --> 12:51.513
But it didn't matter.
They had plenty of time.

12:51.598 --> 12:54.683
[ Sighs ] Yesterday, a letter
came from the draft board.

12:56.486 --> 12:58.270
My son's been called up.

13:00.407 --> 13:03.241
[ Sighs ]
He won't last five minutes in a war.

13:03.277 --> 13:05.877
William: Everyone feels the same
way about their child.

13:05.913 --> 13:08.313
Fitzhugh: Not true.
I wouldn't be worried

13:08.348 --> 13:11.283
if it were either of my two
older boys, Sam or Dale.

13:11.318 --> 13:13.618
But Ronnie's different.

13:13.654 --> 13:16.054
I've got to get him a deferral.

13:16.089 --> 13:17.889
William: Ah.

13:19.293 --> 13:21.760
If his wife were pregnant,
he'd be III-A.

13:23.680 --> 13:26.831
Fitzhugh: You are the best fertility
man in the Midwest, Bill.

13:26.867 --> 13:28.934
I have never denied that.

13:28.969 --> 13:31.386
William: You certainly didn't
take it into account

13:31.438 --> 13:34.022
when you threw me out of Wash U
after 15 years.

13:36.894 --> 13:39.277
Fitzhugh: I can't undo
what's been done, Bill.

13:39.313 --> 13:43.381
The only thing I can do
is try to make it right.

13:43.417 --> 13:47.152
William: Well, what exactly did
you have in mind?

13:47.204 --> 13:49.087
[ Doorbell rings ]

I'm fine, thank you.

13:54.127 --> 13:56.094
I'm here to see Margaret.
Is she here?

13:56.163 --> 13:57.963
Graham: Yeah,
she'll be out in a minute.

Come on in.

Barton:
Oh, I won't keep her long.

14:04.137 --> 14:05.804
You know, I didn't realize

14:05.839 --> 14:08.890
that you were a student
of Rich Huffman's.

14:08.926 --> 14:10.175
Graham: Dr. Huffman?

14:10.227 --> 14:12.244
He was my mentor
in medical school.

14:12.279 --> 14:15.347
Barton: Well, he tells me
that there's no one in the world

14:15.399 --> 14:17.816
that knows more about bacteria
than you do.

14:17.851 --> 14:20.085
He said you're teaching
over at St. John's.

14:20.120 --> 14:22.354
Graham: There's an office
with my name plate on the door,

14:22.389 --> 14:24.456
but the focus of my research
is cholera,

14:24.491 --> 14:26.858
so I spend a good part
of the year abroad.

14:26.893 --> 14:28.660
Barton: - Follow the germs.
Graham: - Precisely.

the bathroom drawer?

14:48.048 --> 14:50.382

Yes, I checked the bathroom...

14:50.434 --> 14:52.884
- I didn't realize you were here.
Barton: - No, no.

14:52.886 --> 14:55.720
There was just a small matter I
was hoping to discuss with you.

Although it seems like maybe now
is not a good time.

on our way out the door, so...

minutes before we have to leave.

15:04.564 --> 15:08.199

I'll look for those earrings.

a lot of time, Barton.

about what you said
the other night,

how difficult it's been.

She's the one who used to book
all of Graham's trips for work,

16:04.624 --> 16:06.541
his trips to India, Kenya.

16:06.593 --> 16:10.128
They started up
a sort of friendship.

He started calling her
when he'd come home

16:12.132 --> 16:13.298
to tell her about his trips.

Eventually, they decided
to take it

16:14.968 --> 16:17.018
beyond the telephone
and meet in person.

For heaven's sake, Margaret,

16:39.910 --> 16:42.927
you're living in some sort
of... commune,

16:42.963 --> 16:45.463
like those crazy people
you hear about in Berkeley.

16:45.499 --> 16:48.299
Margaret: Historically speaking,
in most cultures in the world,

16:48.335 --> 16:50.468
monogamy happens to be
the exception.

16:50.504 --> 16:51.836

Historically speaking?

16:51.838 --> 16:53.505
I came here
to give you permission

16:53.557 --> 16:57.092
to tell Graham about my...

16:57.144 --> 16:58.710
About us...

16:58.745 --> 17:01.746
because I wanted you to be
honest with the man you love.

And you can't even be honest
with yourself.

truth-- at least I'm trying to,

than I can say for you.

No one is more unhappy
about this than I am.

My mother has a true talent
for insinuating herself

to fill the spot.

The chancellor who led
the charge against you--

- against us?
William: - Mm-hmm.

18:13.720 --> 18:17.005
Virginia: Bill, they put dildos
on my desk.

18:17.057 --> 18:20.091
I was mauled in the bathroom.
We can't go back there.

18:20.143 --> 18:22.010
William: That's exactly why
we should go back.

18:22.062 --> 18:23.261
Virginia: I won't.

18:23.263 --> 18:24.979
No, nothing could induce me

18:25.065 --> 18:26.814
to stand in front
of those people and speak.

18:26.850 --> 18:29.150
William: Well, I'll speak
for both of us, then.

18:29.186 --> 18:32.687
Tell them the battle is over,
and they have lost.

18:35.825 --> 18:38.276
It begins with the woman's knees
astride the male,

18:38.278 --> 18:43.248
facing forward, her pubis
perched above his erection.

18:43.283 --> 18:46.084
Virginia: And then, with
a minimal amount of touching,

18:46.119 --> 18:47.952
the tip of the man's penis

18:47.988 --> 18:50.705
is inserted
into the vaginal opening.

18:50.757 --> 18:51.890
Just the tip.

18:53.293 --> 18:54.692
Margaret:
I insert it or Graham does?

18:54.728 --> 18:56.127
Virginia: You do.

18:56.179 --> 18:59.097
Graham, your job is
to do as little as possible.

18:59.132 --> 19:01.065
Just remain totally passive.

19:01.101 --> 19:02.383
Graham: Passive.

19:02.435 --> 19:05.353
Margaret: Graham--
[ Chuckles ]

19:05.388 --> 19:07.839
He's--
he prefers to be in charge.

19:07.874 --> 19:10.692
And I have to say,
I prefer that, too.

19:10.727 --> 19:14.479
I-- I've had partners who've...

19:14.531 --> 19:17.031
left it up to me
to make things happen,

19:17.067 --> 19:19.918
and it hasn't worked out so well
for either of us.

19:19.953 --> 19:22.820
William: Well, in order
to treat the problem,

19:22.872 --> 19:24.822
you both need to be open

19:24.824 --> 19:28.159
to exploring
different sexual dynamics.

19:28.194 --> 19:30.328
Graham: Oh, Margaret
is far more open-minded

19:30.363 --> 19:32.830
than she's giving herself
credit.

19:32.832 --> 19:36.100
- Aren't you?
William: - And you?

19:36.136 --> 19:39.170
Graham: I just don't know how I'll
be able to maintain an erection

19:39.205 --> 19:41.673
if I don't stay... active.

19:41.708 --> 19:43.641
William:
Perhaps your prematurity

19:43.677 --> 19:45.893
is linked to this drive
to be in charge.

19:45.929 --> 19:48.012
You're anticipating
what it feels like

19:48.014 --> 19:51.399
to cross the finish line
before the race has even begun.

19:51.434 --> 19:54.235
What you need to do is take
your foot off the accelerator.

19:54.271 --> 19:58.906
Virginia: Yes. You be the car,
and let Margaret drive.

20:00.694 --> 20:03.528
Graham: [ Chuckles ]
And I just do nothing?

20:03.530 --> 20:06.164
William: You focus on what it
feels like to be inside her.

20:06.199 --> 20:08.266
Resist the temptation to move.

20:08.301 --> 20:10.268
Let the urge to orgasm subside,

20:10.303 --> 20:12.837
and you will become
desensitized.

20:12.872 --> 20:14.806
Virginia:
And once that happens, Margaret,

really the problem with us.

43:54.726 --> 43:57.260
It's me.

43:57.312 --> 44:00.763
I-I picked a situation
as far away as possible

44:00.765 --> 44:02.265
from what I had with you--

44:02.317 --> 44:03.816
a man who wanted me so much

44:03.852 --> 44:07.070
he physically couldn't wait
to have me--

44:07.105 --> 44:10.356
who loved women so much
he had to have two of them--

44:10.408 --> 44:12.275
who led a life without secrets,

44:12.277 --> 44:14.477
so there were no devastating
truths to discover,

44:14.512 --> 44:16.863
because I already knew
the worst...

fix what was broken between us.

what's really broken, Barton...

44:28.877 --> 44:31.260
is me.

44:31.296 --> 44:33.846
I left Graham tonight.

44:35.850 --> 44:37.717
Just walked out
with my coat and my car keys.

44:37.769 --> 44:39.802
You'd think that'd be
the beginning of a fresh start,

44:39.854 --> 44:41.471
wouldn't you?

44:41.523 --> 44:46.309
No possessions, no personal
attachments, not even a wallet.

44:46.311 --> 44:50.446
And yet, um...

44:50.482 --> 44:53.816
I'm gonna make the same mistakes
all over again.

44:53.818 --> 44:55.034
How could I not?

44:55.070 --> 44:57.904
I'm the same person
I've always been.

44:57.956 --> 44:59.655
I'm looking for the same thing.

44:59.657 --> 45:02.492

Oh.

Margaret: Oh. Why?

45:16.841 --> 45:20.093

Because you left him.

You didn't wait for him
to leave you,

about your mother and me
and why our marriage ended.

46:58.910 --> 47:02.328
I think it's important
that you know the truth--

47:02.363 --> 47:05.248
the truth about me.

47:06.668 --> 47:11.254
William: In the future,
when people talk about our work,

47:11.289 --> 47:14.423
I hope that they will say
to each other,

47:14.459 --> 47:16.626
"What was all the fuss about?"

47:16.628 --> 47:19.595
I hope they'll find it
hard to believe

47:19.631 --> 47:24.133
there was ever a time that this
kind of study was necessary.

William: - Go ahead.

47:49.460 --> 47:53.796
Leslie: No one knows how your work
will be received in the future,

47:53.831 --> 47:58.834
but I find myself concerned
about the hidden risks it poses.

47:58.870 --> 48:01.804
Your science takes
the relationship

48:01.839 --> 48:04.206
between man and woman--
husband and wife--

48:04.242 --> 48:07.076
and renders it in numbers,
graphs.

48:07.111 --> 48:10.513
Sex is reduced
to a mechanical process

48:10.565 --> 48:13.683
without any reference
to the human psyche.

48:13.685 --> 48:18.821
Qualities like modesty,
chastity, fidelity, shame--

48:18.856 --> 48:22.458
and most glaring of all,

48:22.493 --> 48:27.196
nowhere in your book
does the word "love" appear.

48:27.198 --> 48:30.700
[ Light applause ]

48:30.702 --> 48:32.702
William: Sorry.
What was your question, sir?

48:34.872 --> 48:39.675
Leslie: My question, Dr. Masters,
is where is the love?

48:45.433 --> 48:48.301
William: [ Clears throat ]
Uh...

48:48.353 --> 48:52.521
In 1687, Sir Isaac Newton
discovered what was then known

48:52.557 --> 48:56.292
as the law of universal
gravitation-- gravity.

48:56.327 --> 48:57.827
Take two objects.

48:57.862 --> 49:00.396
The larger object exerts
an attractive force

49:00.448 --> 49:04.066
on the smaller object, pulling
it towards itself, as it were.

49:04.118 --> 49:06.235
An apple falls from a tree.

49:06.287 --> 49:08.871
The Earth, by far
the more massive object,

49:08.906 --> 49:11.324
pulls the apple to the ground.

49:11.376 --> 49:12.408
Simple enough.

49:12.410 --> 49:15.878
Only Newton's theory...

49:15.913 --> 49:20.049
left scientists
a rather puzzling problem.

49:20.084 --> 49:23.552
To paraphrase you, Dr. Farber,
where is the gravity?

49:23.588 --> 49:25.638
It's not something
you can see or touch.

49:25.673 --> 49:27.623
It's not something
you can put under microscopes

49:27.659 --> 49:30.760
or examine from a telescope.

49:30.762 --> 49:34.063
Well, 230 years after Newton,

49:34.098 --> 49:37.400
a German patent clerk
in Switzerland

49:37.435 --> 49:39.068
finally realized that scientists

49:39.103 --> 49:41.904
have been asking
the wrong question all along.

49:41.939 --> 49:43.739
They would never find an object

49:43.775 --> 49:46.409
in all the immensity of space
called gravity,

49:46.444 --> 49:47.877
because, in point of fact,

49:47.945 --> 49:52.381
gravity is nothing
but the shape of space itself.

49:53.751 --> 49:57.119
That clerk-- Einstein--
posited that the apple

49:57.205 --> 49:58.871
does not fall to the ground

49:58.923 --> 50:02.925
because the Earth exerts some
mysterious kind of force upon it.

50:02.960 --> 50:05.127
The apple falls to the ground

50:05.129 --> 50:08.631
because it is following
the lines and grooves

50:08.683 --> 50:12.301
that gravity has carved
into space.

50:12.353 --> 50:16.605
And when we talk about sex,

50:16.641 --> 50:19.575
we do not talk about love,
Dr. Farber,

50:19.610 --> 50:23.813
because love cannot be rendered
into columns and graphs,

50:23.865 --> 50:28.250
as if it were the same
as blood pressure or heart rate.

50:28.286 --> 50:33.489
Love is not a force exerted
by one body onto another.

50:33.524 --> 50:38.094
It is the very fabric
of those bodies.

50:38.129 --> 50:44.834
Love is that which carves
the lines and grooves...

50:44.836 --> 50:47.770
The curvature of our desire.
