10:07.101 --> 10:09.434
Betty: You're very
unpopular this morning.

10:09.470 --> 10:11.436
They're all from
Ronald Sturgis and pals,

10:11.438 --> 10:13.655
those religious weirdos
who've been hanging out

10:13.691 --> 10:15.190
in the lobby this whole week.

10:15.242 --> 10:16.842
What happened to you?

10:16.877 --> 10:19.845
William: [ Groans ]
Tripped up on my own front step.

10:19.880 --> 10:21.246
Betty: Let me fix it.

10:21.281 --> 10:23.081
William: No, I don't want anyone
touching my--

10:23.117 --> 10:25.333
- Aah! God.
Betty: - Oh.

10:25.369 --> 10:27.669
William: Betty, don't--

10:27.705 --> 10:29.788
The vertebral column
is very sensitive. You can't--

10:29.840 --> 10:31.456
Betty: Do you want the pain
to go away?

10:31.508 --> 10:32.624
Trust me, I know what I'm doing.

10:32.676 --> 10:34.009
Helen's got sciatica,

10:34.044 --> 10:35.877
and she's too vain
to give up high heels.

10:35.929 --> 10:37.379
Now just lean back.

10:37.431 --> 10:39.848
William: I most certainly will n--
Aaaaah!

10:39.883 --> 10:41.099
Aah!

10:41.135 --> 10:42.601
Ah! Betty! Stop!

10:42.636 --> 10:44.269
Betty: All right,
let your spine stretch out.

10:44.304 --> 10:45.470
William: Stop it, Betty!
I mean it!

10:45.522 --> 10:46.855
Betty: Sometimes you
can actually feel

10:46.890 --> 10:48.473
- the vertebra pop back in--
William: - I mean it!

10:48.475 --> 10:49.841
- [ Bones pop ]
- Ohh!

10:49.877 --> 10:53.028
Betty: Oh. Ooh.

10:53.063 --> 10:54.146
William: Oh.

10:54.198 --> 10:56.481

10:56.533 --> 10:58.450
William: - Oh, you did it.
Betty: - Yeah.

10:58.485 --> 11:01.536
William: Oh. Oh, Betty.

11:01.572 --> 11:07.659
Oh.
That is absolutely...

11:09.496 --> 11:10.962
Doug.

11:10.998 --> 11:14.082
Fitzhugh: I was... hoping to have
a word with you, Bill.

11:14.134 --> 11:17.335
I'd appreciate a few moments
of your time.

11:17.371 --> 11:18.837
William: Of course.

11:18.872 --> 11:20.772
Thank you, Betty.
That'll be all.

11:22.543 --> 11:26.011
Fitzhugh: Look, I feel awful about
what happened the other week.

11:26.046 --> 11:28.113
Seeing you
at that cocktail party,

11:28.148 --> 11:31.650
it brought back some--
well, some strong emotions.

11:31.685 --> 11:33.852
For you, too, I'm sure.

11:33.887 --> 11:36.488
The truth of the matter is,

11:36.523 --> 11:40.525
it's been 10 years since...
the unpleasantness between us.

11:40.527 --> 11:43.361
And clearly, you've gone on to
some impressive accomplishments.

11:43.413 --> 11:44.780
You've got your own practice,

11:44.832 --> 11:47.032
you've got a best-selling book
on your hands.

11:47.034 --> 11:50.285
I think it's high time
that you and I bury the hatchet.

11:50.337 --> 11:51.570
Don't you think?

11:54.575 --> 11:56.208
William: Well...

11:56.243 --> 12:01.313
that's quite a change of heart
you've had, Doug, haven't you?

12:01.348 --> 12:04.082
Fitzhugh:
I've given it a lot of thought.

12:04.151 --> 12:05.784
William:
In the space of two weeks,

12:05.819 --> 12:07.919
to go from publicly insulting
a man,

12:07.955 --> 12:11.223
calling his integrity
into question,

12:11.275 --> 12:14.142
demeaning his work,

12:14.194 --> 12:17.395
to this... display.

12:20.284 --> 12:23.485
There wouldn't be any ulterior
motives here, would there, Doug?

12:27.074 --> 12:28.874
Fitzhugh: Hmm.

12:31.078 --> 12:33.628
You have a son, don't you, Bill?

12:33.664 --> 12:36.081
I'm sure you would do anything
in the world for him,

12:36.133 --> 12:37.883
wouldn't you?

12:40.053 --> 12:42.254
Ronnie is an architect.

12:42.256 --> 12:46.091
Two years ago, he married
a sweet girl, Leelah.

12:46.143 --> 12:48.343
They've been trying
to have a baby. No luck.

12:48.395 --> 12:51.513
But it didn't matter.
They had plenty of time.

12:51.598 --> 12:54.683
[ Sighs ] Yesterday, a letter
came from the draft board.

12:56.486 --> 12:58.270
My son's been called up.

13:00.407 --> 13:03.241
[ Sighs ]
He won't last five minutes in a war.

13:03.277 --> 13:05.877
William: Everyone feels the same
way about their child.

13:05.913 --> 13:08.313
Fitzhugh: Not true.
I wouldn't be worried

13:08.348 --> 13:11.283
if it were either of my two
older boys, Sam or Dale.

13:11.318 --> 13:13.618
But Ronnie's different.

13:13.654 --> 13:16.054
I've got to get him a deferral.

13:16.089 --> 13:17.889
William: Ah.

13:19.293 --> 13:21.760
If his wife were pregnant,
he'd be III-A.

13:23.680 --> 13:26.831
Fitzhugh: You are the best fertility
man in the Midwest, Bill.

13:26.867 --> 13:28.934
I have never denied that.

13:28.969 --> 13:31.386
William: You certainly didn't
take it into account

13:31.438 --> 13:34.022
when you threw me out of Wash U
after 15 years.

13:36.894 --> 13:39.277
Fitzhugh: I can't undo
what's been done, Bill.

13:39.313 --> 13:43.381
The only thing I can do
is try to make it right.

13:43.417 --> 13:47.152
William: Well, what exactly did
you have in mind?

13:47.204 --> 13:49.087
[ Doorbell rings ]

I'm fine, thank you.

13:54.127 --> 13:56.094
I'm here to see Margaret.
Is she here?

13:56.163 --> 13:57.963
Graham: Yeah,
she'll be out in a minute.

Come on in.

Barton:
Oh, I won't keep her long.

14:04.137 --> 14:05.804
You know, I didn't realize

14:05.839 --> 14:08.890
that you were a student
of Rich Huffman's.

14:08.926 --> 14:10.175
Graham: Dr. Huffman?

14:10.227 --> 14:12.244
He was my mentor
in medical school.

14:12.279 --> 14:15.347
Barton: Well, he tells me
that there's no one in the world

14:15.399 --> 14:17.816
that knows more about bacteria
than you do.

14:17.851 --> 14:20.085
He said you're teaching
over at St. John's.

14:20.120 --> 14:22.354
Graham: There's an office
with my name plate on the door,

14:22.389 --> 14:24.456
but the focus of my research
is cholera,

14:24.491 --> 14:26.858
so I spend a good part
of the year abroad.

14:26.893 --> 14:28.660
Barton: - Follow the germs.
Graham: - Precisely.

the bathroom drawer?

14:48.048 --> 14:50.382

Yes, I checked the bathroom...

14:50.434 --> 14:52.884
- I didn't realize you were here.
Barton: - No, no.

14:52.886 --> 14:55.720
There was just a small matter I
was hoping to discuss with you.

Although it seems like maybe now
is not a good time.

on our way out the door, so...

minutes before we have to leave.

15:04.564 --> 15:08.199

I'll look for those earrings.

a lot of time, Barton.

about what you said
the other night,

how difficult it's been.

She's the one who used to book
all of Graham's trips for work,

16:04.624 --> 16:06.541
his trips to India, Kenya.

16:06.593 --> 16:10.128
They started up
a sort of friendship.

He started calling her
when he'd come home

16:12.132 --> 16:13.298
to tell her about his trips.

Eventually, they decided
to take it

16:14.968 --> 16:17.018
beyond the telephone
and meet in person.

For heaven's sake, Margaret,

16:39.910 --> 16:42.927
you're living in some sort
of... commune,

16:42.963 --> 16:45.463
like those crazy people
you hear about in Berkeley.

16:45.499 --> 16:48.299
Margaret: Historically speaking,
in most cultures in the world,

16:48.335 --> 16:50.468
monogamy happens to be
the exception.

16:50.504 --> 16:51.836

Historically speaking?

16:51.838 --> 16:53.505
I came here
to give you permission

16:53.557 --> 16:57.092
to tell Graham about my...

16:57.144 --> 16:58.710
About us...

16:58.745 --> 17:01.746
because I wanted you to be
honest with the man you love.

And you can't even be honest
with yourself.

truth-- at least I'm trying to,

than I can say for you.

No one is more unhappy
about this than I am.

My mother has a true talent
for insinuating herself

to fill the spot.

The chancellor who led
the charge against you--

- against us?
William: - Mm-hmm.

18:13.720 --> 18:17.005
Virginia: Bill, they put dildos
on my desk.

18:17.057 --> 18:20.091
I was mauled in the bathroom.
We can't go back there.

18:20.143 --> 18:22.010
William: That's exactly why
we should go back.

18:22.062 --> 18:23.261
Virginia: I won't.

18:23.263 --> 18:24.979
No, nothing could induce me

18:25.065 --> 18:26.814
to stand in front
of those people and speak.

18:26.850 --> 18:29.150
William: Well, I'll speak
for both of us, then.

18:29.186 --> 18:32.687
Tell them the battle is over,
and they have lost.

18:35.825 --> 18:38.276
It begins with the woman's knees
astride the male,

18:38.278 --> 18:43.248
facing forward, her pubis
perched above his erection.

18:43.283 --> 18:46.084
Virginia: And then, with
a minimal amount of touching,

18:46.119 --> 18:47.952
the tip of the man's penis

18:47.988 --> 18:50.705
is inserted
into the vaginal opening.

18:50.757 --> 18:51.890
Just the tip.

18:53.293 --> 18:54.692
Margaret:
I insert it or Graham does?

18:54.728 --> 18:56.127
Virginia: You do.

18:56.179 --> 18:59.097
Graham, your job is
to do as little as possible.

18:59.132 --> 19:01.065
Just remain totally passive.

19:01.101 --> 19:02.383
Graham: Passive.

19:02.435 --> 19:05.353
Margaret: Graham--
[ Chuckles ]

19:05.388 --> 19:07.839
He's--
he prefers to be in charge.

19:07.874 --> 19:10.692
And I have to say,
I prefer that, too.

19:10.727 --> 19:14.479
I-- I've had partners who've...

19:14.531 --> 19:17.031
left it up to me
to make things happen,

19:17.067 --> 19:19.918
and it hasn't worked out so well
for either of us.

19:19.953 --> 19:22.820
William: Well, in order
to treat the problem,

19:22.872 --> 19:24.822
you both need to be open

19:24.824 --> 19:28.159
to exploring
different sexual dynamics.

19:28.194 --> 19:30.328
Graham: Oh, Margaret
is far more open-minded

19:30.363 --> 19:32.830
than she's giving herself
credit.

19:32.832 --> 19:36.100
- Aren't you?
William: - And you?

19:36.136 --> 19:39.170
Graham: I just don't know how I'll
be able to maintain an erection

19:39.205 --> 19:41.673
if I don't stay... active.

19:41.708 --> 19:43.641
William:
Perhaps your prematurity

19:43.677 --> 19:45.893
is linked to this drive
to be in charge.

19:45.929 --> 19:48.012
You're anticipating
what it feels like

19:48.014 --> 19:51.399
to cross the finish line
before the race has even begun.

19:51.434 --> 19:54.235
What you need to do is take
your foot off the accelerator.

19:54.271 --> 19:58.906
Virginia: Yes. You be the car,
and let Margaret drive.

20:00.694 --> 20:03.528
Graham: [ Chuckles ]
And I just do nothing?

20:03.530 --> 20:06.164
William: You focus on what it
feels like to be inside her.

20:06.199 --> 20:08.266
Resist the temptation to move.

20:08.301 --> 20:10.268
Let the urge to orgasm subside,

20:10.303 --> 20:12.837
and you will become
desensitized.

20:12.872 --> 20:14.806
Virginia:
And once that happens, Margaret,

into my son's face.

For instance, I know
that you're, what-- 13?

But you're in Johnny's grade.

held back now, Dennis?

33:04.560 --> 33:05.809

about yourself?

33:08.364 --> 33:10.147

33:10.149 --> 33:11.698
Because it means you're stupid.

at other boys, boys like my son,

as the law of universal
gravitation-- gravity.

48:56.327 --> 48:57.827

The larger object exerts
an attractive force

it towards itself, as it were.

To paraphrase you, Dr. Farber,
where is the gravity?

It's not something

finally realized that scientists

the wrong question all along.

49:43.775 --> 49:46.409
in all the immensity of space
called gravity,

49:46.444 --> 49:47.877

gravity is nothing
but the shape of space itself.

posited that the apple

49:57.205 --> 49:58.871

mysterious kind of force upon it.

50:02.960 --> 50:05.127
The apple falls to the ground

50:05.129 --> 50:08.631

into space.
