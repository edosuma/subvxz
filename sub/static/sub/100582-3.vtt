56:06.488 --> 56:07.948
I want what you promised me.

I could. And I told you as much.

56:31.430 --> 56:34.057
This was your idea, Charlotte.
You came to us.

56:35.809 --> 56:37.019
And you were very confident

56:37.102 --> 56:38.770
that you would be able
to smuggle it out.

56:38.854 --> 56:40.022
HALE: And I did.

56:40.105 --> 56:42.274
Our logs show it was downloaded

where the key is.

57:12.721 --> 57:17.476

LISA JOY: The character of Hale
is one that I'm so eager

59:49.544 --> 59:52.589
to explore.
We've seen her as human,

59:52.672 --> 59:54.883
and now we get to see her
as a host,

59:55.091 --> 59:58.512

What is it
that makes you who you are.

1:00:09.731 --> 1:00:13.318
Is it your physical form?
Is it your experiences,

But it's their soul,

1:00:32.170 --> 1:00:34.422

she wants to cut into her skin

I felt like a different person.

1:01:08.206 --> 1:01:10.709
I wasn't the same emotionally,
I wasn't the same biologically.

1:01:10.792 --> 1:01:11.918
Like, on a cellular level.

1:01:12.711 --> 1:01:15.297
And so I was thinking,
how would that be for Hale?

1:01:15.380 --> 1:01:17.549
I remember what it's like
to be me.

1:01:18.383 --> 1:01:20.635
THÉ: That is kind of
the beginning of her awakening.

1:01:20.719 --> 1:01:23.305
And it is a little bit nature,
and it is a little bit nurture.

1:01:23.388 --> 1:01:24.931
And it's kind of all rolled
in one.

about Delos for so long.

1:01:31.438 --> 1:01:35.275
We knew these headquarters
had to be completely iconic.

MANDI DILLIN: As soon as we knew
we were going to Spain,

1:01:39.195 --> 1:01:41.448
in my head,
the only place to film

1:01:41.531 --> 1:01:42.949
was the City of Arts

HOWARD CUMMINGS:
It's just stunning architecture.

1:01:46.536 --> 1:01:48.413
It really gives me
an opportunity

SHAY CUNLIFFE: The architecture
guided the costumes.

1:02:03.595 --> 1:02:07.182
So there's this lack of detail
to most of our costumes

1:02:07.265 --> 1:02:08.558
that's intentional.

1:02:10.602 --> 1:02:12.938

1:02:14.439 --> 1:02:17.734
THÉ: When we started talking
about Caleb and his journey,

1:02:17.943 --> 1:02:19.486
we talked a lot about
A Christmas Carol,

1:02:19.569 --> 1:02:20.487
and Charles Dickens.

1:02:20.987 --> 1:02:24.074
We liked the quality
of the ghost of your past.

1:02:24.157 --> 1:02:27.160
And we liked this idea
that Dolores would take Caleb

1:02:27.243 --> 1:02:28.286
on a tour of his life.

1:02:28.954 --> 1:02:31.623
You must be hungry.
Let me buy you breakfast.

1:02:32.582 --> 1:02:34.542
JON CARLOS: We used
a lot of diagonal angles,

1:02:34.751 --> 1:02:38.129
anytime we would show Dolores
with another character.

1:02:38.672 --> 1:02:41.716
We felt as if the diagonals
were Dolores's web

1:02:41.925 --> 1:02:43.259
wrapping around an individual.

1:02:43.593 --> 1:02:45.512
Why didn't you tell those men
about me before?

1:02:46.137 --> 1:02:47.138
You surprised me.

1:02:47.389 --> 1:02:50.392
She's really only seen
the side of humans in the park,

1:02:50.475 --> 1:02:51.476
which is the worst sides.

1:02:52.310 --> 1:02:54.229
We wanted someone that
would kind of stop Dolores

1:02:54.312 --> 1:02:56.731
in her tracks a little bit.
And challenge her,

1:02:56.815 --> 1:02:59.734
somewhat uniform understanding,
of humanity.

1:02:59.985 --> 1:03:00.944

NOLAN: In terms of influence...

1:03:02.529 --> 1:03:03.905
I was very much thinking
about The Matrix.

1:03:03.989 --> 1:03:05.824
But the slightly lo‐fi version.

1:03:06.950 --> 1:03:08.034
You don't need Zion.

1:03:08.743 --> 1:03:10.453
You don't need to plug everyone
in like a battery.

1:03:10.537 --> 1:03:12.998
We've already done it.
We've already created the Matrix

1:03:13.081 --> 1:03:15.250
invisibly, within our own world.
Like an overlay.

Production design,

and the entire
art department team,

1:03:22.757 --> 1:03:24.217
they really helped develop,
really,

1:03:24.300 --> 1:03:25.969
what the world looks like.

1:03:26.845 --> 1:03:28.471
And we were able to take that
and run with it

1:03:28.555 --> 1:03:30.015
from a VFX standpoint.

1:03:31.141 --> 1:03:32.100
(MACHINE WHIRRING)

1:03:32.183 --> 1:03:34.686
We've also seen hundreds
of robots.

1:03:35.353 --> 1:03:38.481
So trying to create
something new is not easy.

1:03:40.775 --> 1:03:43.862
Jonah had specific ideas
for the movement of the robot.

1:03:44.779 --> 1:03:46.239
Typical robots,
they have pistons,

1:03:46.322 --> 1:03:47.991
or hydraulics that move it.

1:03:48.908 --> 1:03:51.119
For George,
the actuators would actually

1:03:51.369 --> 1:03:52.871
be inside the arm itself.

1:03:58.334 --> 1:04:00.545
The Riot Control mech
comes in five boxes.

1:04:01.379 --> 1:04:03.757
Howard described it as being
a Swiss Army knife.

1:04:04.382 --> 1:04:07.135
When it's activated,
it transforms and connects

1:04:07.218 --> 1:04:08.219
and becomes one.

1:04:13.224 --> 1:04:15.268
NOLAN: When you look at
mobility and transportation,

1:04:15.685 --> 1:04:17.145
we're all moving towards
this idea

1:04:17.228 --> 1:04:19.314
of personal‐air mobility.

1:04:20.023 --> 1:04:22.233
LE: These were
the very first designs

1:04:22.442 --> 1:04:23.485
at the Airpod.

1:04:24.027 --> 1:04:27.322
Jonah and Howard
wanted something very balanced,

1:04:27.655 --> 1:04:30.075
utilitarian.
They described it as,

1:04:30.241 --> 1:04:31.159
"A flying Cadillac."

1:04:31.785 --> 1:04:34.037
BRUCE BRANIT: Obviously,
we can't fly an Airpod around.

1:04:34.329 --> 1:04:36.748
We have to take a piece
of the Airpod that has the seat,

1:04:37.248 --> 1:04:39.334
we bring that to set,
and digitally,

1:04:39.417 --> 1:04:40.794
from that moment on,
we may have

1:04:40.877 --> 1:04:43.379
to erase that Airpod
and then create it flying away.

1:04:48.676 --> 1:04:51.096
The rideshare is mostly
a practical visual effect.

1:04:51.763 --> 1:04:53.681
CARLOS: We have two of them
built from the ground up.

1:04:53.932 --> 1:04:56.142
Chassis, engine,
everything was designed.

1:04:57.185 --> 1:04:59.062
JOE WEHMEYER: We have a tiny
little compartment

1:04:59.145 --> 1:05:00.897
that's well‐hidden in the front
for a driver

1:05:00.980 --> 1:05:02.649
that drives the vehicle.

If you go out in the world,
the future is there.

1:05:07.445 --> 1:05:10.824
It's in places like Singapore,
Spain, and Los Angeles.
