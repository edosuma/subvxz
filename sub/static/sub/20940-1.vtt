29:54.520 --> 29:56.591
Leave him in.

29:56.680 --> 29:58.433
You alright?

29:58.520 --> 29:59.636
Yeah.

30:55.560 --> 30:56.596

Bill, I'm alright.
I just got caught with a shot.

30:59.960 --> 31:01.076
Pull.

31:01.160 --> 31:02.958

31:16.840 --> 31:18.797

31:20.720 --> 31:22.120
Go straight into him.

31:22.560 --> 31:24.517

32:10.440 --> 32:13.035
- Jimmy! Good to see you.
- You too, Joe.

32:13.160 --> 32:15.231
Hey, what's all this, eh?

32:15.320 --> 32:16.993
Come on, sit down.

32:17.120 --> 32:19.351
- How was your workout?
- Yeah, good.

32:19.440 --> 32:21.511
- You eaten yet?
- No, I'm alright, thanks.

32:21.600 --> 32:23.671
Would you bring my friend here
a steak, please?

32:23.760 --> 32:26.480
- Honestly, Joe, I'm alright.
- Excuse me.

32:26.560 --> 32:28.677
I've just had one and they're delicious.

32:28.800 --> 32:31.440
Bring him a medium-rare steak, alright?

32:31.520 --> 32:34.433
- And anything to drink?
- No, I'm not drinking, thanks.

32:34.520 --> 32:37.274
I'll have, erm...
I'll have a glass of water.

32:37.360 --> 32:39.158
- Sure.
- Thanks.

32:42.560 --> 32:45.280
So, you've come to borrow a razor, right?

32:46.640 --> 32:48.199
I've come out with no money on me...

32:48.320 --> 32:51.074
What, I can't buy you dinner? Please.

32:51.160 --> 32:52.799
And how's William?

32:53.760 --> 32:54.989
He's alright, yeah.

32:55.080 --> 32:58.790
You know Bill. He's, erm...

Yeah. Yeah.

33:09.080 --> 33:11.959
I don't think I've seen you
since your mum passed, Jimmy.

33:13.160 --> 33:15.675
Lovely lady. How long ago was that?

33:15.760 --> 33:16.989
It was a year ago, Joe.

33:18.160 --> 33:19.196
<font color="#CC6600">JOE:</font> Yeah.

33:28.800 --> 33:31.315
- Thanks.
- So, what's happening with you?

33:31.400 --> 33:32.436
Erm...

33:33.720 --> 33:36.440
To be honest, I'm looking for work.
I wondered if you had any.

33:36.520 --> 33:38.239
What kind of work are you looking for?

33:38.320 --> 33:40.198
I just need to get in front.

33:41.680 --> 33:43.239
I'm looking to fight again.

33:46.000 --> 33:47.275
Unlicensed?

33:48.080 --> 33:49.355
Yeah.

33:51.080 --> 33:53.959
If you're looking for a couple
of hundred quid, there are shows.

33:54.040 --> 33:58.159
They call them unlicensed, but mainly
they're office boys fucking about.

33:58.240 --> 34:00.880
I know... What if I want to make
a bit more, Joe?

34:00.960 --> 34:04.237
Couple of grand. Just a one-off.
I don't care who they put me in with.

34:04.320 --> 34:07.313
What kind of condition are you in,
Jimmy? Have you still got it?

34:08.080 --> 34:09.514
Yeah. I feel good.

34:10.520 --> 34:11.556
Yeah.

34:15.320 --> 34:19.280
<font color="#CC6600">JOE:</font> There is a show at the end of next month, up North, friends of mine.

34:20.520 --> 34:21.748
They've got this kid.

34:21.840 --> 34:25.754
I won't lie to you, Jimmy.
He's a bit warm and he's a big lad.

34:27.480 --> 34:30.074
How do you feel about
giving the weight away?

34:30.159 --> 34:31.913
That's fine. Yeah, I'll take it, Joe.

34:32.000 --> 34:33.320
I'll take it.

34:33.400 --> 34:36.632
He's dangerous, this kid. He hurts people.

34:36.760 --> 34:40.150
And that's what they pay the money for.
They wanna see him hurt people.

34:40.239 --> 34:42.516
But they want somebody in with him
who can mix it up.

34:42.639 --> 34:44.632
They want their money's worth.

34:44.719 --> 34:45.755
So, yeah...

34:47.280 --> 34:48.714
I think I can get you your money.

34:48.800 --> 34:53.875
I'll tell them I've got an ex-ABA
champion who's looking for a fight.

35:00.400 --> 35:01.595
Jimmy,

35:01.680 --> 35:05.913
you were one of the bravest kids
I ever saw.

35:06.040 --> 35:08.635
The thing I don't know is
what kind of nick you're in now.

35:09.680 --> 35:13.310
So if you take this, it's on your back.

35:13.400 --> 35:17.030
Whatever happens up there,
you are on your own.

35:17.120 --> 35:18.759
- Yeah, I know.
- And you're up for it?

35:18.840 --> 35:20.559
Yeah, I'm up for it.

35:22.040 --> 35:25.920
- Right. I'll make the phone call.
- Thanks, Joe.

35:27.440 --> 35:30.080
Oh, look! Steak's here.

35:30.160 --> 35:32.311
Lucky you don't have to make the weight.

35:32.440 --> 35:34.432
Appreciate it. Thanks.

36:14.440 --> 36:16.159
So how's that steak, eh?

36:16.240 --> 36:19.551
It's lovely, Joe. Thanks.
You didn't have to do that.

36:19.640 --> 36:20.960
You're on.

36:21.040 --> 36:22.918
Two-and-a-half grand.

36:23.000 --> 36:27.836
If there's a knockout, last one
left standing gets a £500 bonus.

36:27.920 --> 36:31.311
So the worst that can happen,
you walk out with two-and-a-half grand,

36:31.400 --> 36:33.357
and possibly three.

36:35.360 --> 36:37.431
- Is it gloves, Joe?
- Yeah, course it is.

36:37.520 --> 36:39.239
But you know the game, Jimmy.

36:39.320 --> 36:40.993
Come on, it's unlicensed.

36:41.080 --> 36:43.834
Can't promise you
the Marquess of Queensberry, son.

36:45.880 --> 36:48.111
What are you thinking?

36:48.200 --> 36:49.953
I'm thinking it's great.

36:50.040 --> 36:51.713
I'll take it, Joe. Thanks.

36:52.640 --> 36:54.233
You brave little fucker.

36:55.680 --> 36:57.672
But you always were.

36:58.600 --> 37:00.831
How old were you when you won the ABAs?

37:00.920 --> 37:03.071
It was the juniors, Joe.
I won the Junior ABAs.

37:03.200 --> 37:04.429
I was only 16.

37:04.520 --> 37:07.240
I was there when you knocked out
Peter McCauley at the hall.

37:07.320 --> 37:09.357
How old was you then? You was only a lad.

37:09.440 --> 37:11.875
That was my first unlicensed, so I was 22.

37:12.000 --> 37:13.195
22.

37:15.280 --> 37:18.034
He was a class fighter an' all,
McCauley, wasn't he?

37:18.120 --> 37:19.952
He was past it by then, to be honest, Joe.

37:20.040 --> 37:22.430
<font color="#CC6600">JOE:</font> Don't do yourself down.

37:22.520 --> 37:26.070

<font color="#CC6600">JOE:</font> Sure.

- I, er...
- What is it?

37:42.560 --> 37:44.597
Joe, is there any chance
I can get a little sub,

37:44.680 --> 37:46.911
just to get me over to the fight?

37:47.000 --> 37:48.798
How much do you need?

37:48.880 --> 37:51.634
Anything you got, really.
Sorry to do this.

37:51.720 --> 37:53.120
Two hundred sort you out?

37:53.200 --> 37:55.874
Yeah, that's plenty, yeah. Thanks, Joe.

37:56.000 --> 37:58.674
- I'll give you it out the fight purse.
- Course you will.

37:59.920 --> 38:00.956
Thanks, Joe.

38:02.920 --> 38:06.197
I may pop by the gym tomorrow, catch up
with Bill if I'm round that way.

38:06.280 --> 38:09.432
Joe, I've, erm...
I've not told Bill about this.

38:09.520 --> 38:11.591
You know what he's like with unlicensed.

38:11.680 --> 38:14.798
- I'd rather keep this to ourselves.
- Say no more. Come here.

38:17.920 --> 38:19.070
Be lucky up there, eh?

38:21.400 --> 38:23.312
Thanks, Joe. Cheers.

42:25.120 --> 42:28.113
that they may solve their common problems

42:28.200 --> 42:30.999
and help others
to recover from alcoholism.

42:32.160 --> 42:36.473
The only requirement for membership
is a desire to stop drinking.

42:36.560 --> 42:40.031
There are no dues or fees
for AA membership.

42:40.160 --> 42:43.471
We are self-supporting
through our own contributions.

any sect, denomination,

in any controversy,

42:55.520 --> 43:00.037
neither endorses nor opposes any causes.

Our primary purpose is to stay sober

What was you, about 14?

46:29.960 --> 46:31.838

Mm...

46:50.440 --> 46:52.716
A buffoon at times.

46:54.320 --> 46:56.039
But you was an 'appy boy, you know.

46:57.400 --> 46:59.710
Always had this big smile.

47:02.480 --> 47:05.518
And you was polite.
Well, you still are. Very polite.

47:06.600 --> 47:08.319
A very, very polite boy you were.

47:19.960 --> 47:21.997

47:27.880 --> 47:29.997
Is everything alright, Bill?

47:33.280 --> 47:34.873
I got the big 'un, son.

47:37.400 --> 47:40.393
They tell me I got
a few weeks to live, you know...

47:40.480 --> 47:42.790
It's all been confirmed.

47:42.920 --> 47:45.640
Well, it could be tomorrow,
it could be next week, you know...

47:48.040 --> 47:49.599
I'm dying, son.

47:54.160 --> 47:56.072
You being serious?
I don't know what to say.

47:56.160 --> 47:58.959
Well, there's nothing
you can say. I mean, you know...

47:59.040 --> 48:00.474
What does one say?

48:01.800 --> 48:03.075
Who knows? Does Eddie know?

48:03.160 --> 48:04.992
Well, of course Eddie knows.

48:05.960 --> 48:07.280
But no one else.

48:08.480 --> 48:10.233
I don't want my boys to know.

48:10.320 --> 48:13.836
I mean, they'll know
when the time's right, but, er...

48:15.960 --> 48:19.670
I just need to spend a bit of time
with my Carol, you know.

48:28.160 --> 48:30.834
She'll let Eddie know if anything happens.

48:34.960 --> 48:38.636
Right. I'm... I'm tired.

48:38.720 --> 48:41.838
I ain't got time to fuck about here
so I'm gonna say something to you now

48:41.920 --> 48:43.957
and I... I want you to hear me.

48:44.760 --> 48:46.433
You listening?

48:46.520 --> 48:48.034
Yeah.

48:48.120 --> 48:50.430
I know you've been sleeping here
and so does Eddie.

48:50.520 --> 48:52.955
No... It's not a problem.

48:54.920 --> 48:57.515
I just want you to stay close to Eddie.

48:57.600 --> 48:59.557
Now, this place is taken care of.

48:59.640 --> 49:02.838
You know, erm... everything's kosher.

49:02.960 --> 49:05.953
It's in good hands.
I mean, Eddie's a good man.

49:08.120 --> 49:10.396
But I need you to keep your eye on him.

49:11.800 --> 49:14.395
Maybe he can help you
with this training for this fight.

49:16.760 --> 49:18.035
What?

49:18.880 --> 49:20.997
Did you think I wouldn't hear about it?

49:25.000 --> 49:27.071
I'm alright, Bill.
I wanna go up there on me own.

49:27.160 --> 49:29.391
- I'm alright with it.
- No, no, no, no...

49:29.480 --> 49:31.676
I don't know what demons you're fighting.

49:32.680 --> 49:35.240
And I don't know how much
they're paying you to go up North

49:35.320 --> 49:38.438
to get your brains bashed in
by this kid. That's your business.

49:40.840 --> 49:43.071
But I'd like to give you
a little bit of advice.

49:43.160 --> 49:45.629
Now, you can take it or leave it,
that's down to you.

49:48.480 --> 49:52.599
My advice is that when it's done,
when this fight is done and dusted,

49:54.840 --> 49:56.320
just walk away.

49:58.320 --> 49:59.834
Just walk.

50:04.920 --> 50:06.513
You see, it's...

50:07.440 --> 50:10.080
Sometimes you need to give in
to win, Jimmy.

50:14.600 --> 50:17.035
You can't fight it forever, son.

50:24.440 --> 50:27.353
Right, erm... I'm gonna go now.

50:30.000 --> 50:31.957
Ah... Give us me smother.

50:45.760 --> 50:47.752
Here's your keys.

50:49.560 --> 50:50.960
Don't forget to lock up.

- Don't say anything.

52:50.880 --> 52:52.553
So when's your fight?

52:55.120 --> 52:56.918
It's just over two weeks.

53:01.920 --> 53:04.276
- I could do with someone up there.
- No, no, no.

53:04.360 --> 53:07.034
Don't start with that.
I don't have time for this, Jimmy.

53:08.200 --> 53:09.793
This gym doesn't run itself.

53:09.880 --> 53:13.237
These kids just don't turn up
and everything's magically in its place.

53:13.320 --> 53:17.155
It takes graft. It takes somebody
coming in day in, day out.

53:17.240 --> 53:18.754
- The last thing I need...
- Hold on.

53:18.880 --> 53:23.830
No, no, no, no, you hold on cos I don't
have a minute to hold on to. Okay?

53:24.720 --> 53:28.680
If you wanna go up there and fight
unlicensed, that's your prerogative.

53:28.760 --> 53:31.514
That's your choice to go and get
smashed to bits if you want to.

53:32.520 --> 53:34.000
But I promised Bill.

53:34.080 --> 53:37.596
I gave him my word that I was gonna
get you ready for this fight

53:37.680 --> 53:40.070
and I'm gonna honour that.

53:40.160 --> 53:42.391
But I am not going up there with you.

53:42.480 --> 53:43.755
I don't wanna see it.

53:45.240 --> 53:47.596
Now, I've got a gym to run

53:47.680 --> 53:49.194
and I need to be here.

53:51.280 --> 53:53.351
Just like he's been here for us.

53:55.160 --> 53:56.958
So why don't you get yourself wrapped up

53:57.040 --> 53:59.396
and we'll get back into this ring
and do some work, okay?

53:59.480 --> 54:02.040
- Alright, fine.
- Let's get it done, yeah?

54:05.240 --> 54:07.960
- So, left, right, right to the body?
- Yes.

54:10.160 --> 54:11.196

if you don't put it in this ring,

<font color="#CC6600">MARY:</font> Do we have any newcomers to the group?

This isn't to embarrass you,

01:26:11.960 --> 01:26:15.192
just to give you the same warm welcome
we received when we came in.

01:26:18.200 --> 01:26:20.237
My name's Jimmy, I'm an alcoholic.

<font color="#CC6600">GROUP:</font> Hello, Jimmy.

01:26:24.520 --> 01:26:26.239
It's my second meeting.

01:26:26.320 --> 01:26:29.040
I've not had a drink in a while
but I know I'm gonna drink again.

01:26:31.680 --> 01:26:34.149
And I know I'm gonna drink again
and I can't stop.

01:26:35.920 --> 01:26:37.479
And it's killing me.

01:26:38.680 --> 01:26:40.160
And I can't fight it, you know?

01:26:40.240 --> 01:26:42.630
And I'm a fighter but I can't fight this.

01:26:43.440 --> 01:26:45.113
And I think I might need help.

01:26:46.480 --> 01:26:48.153
So that's why I'm here.

01:26:48.240 --> 01:26:50.880
