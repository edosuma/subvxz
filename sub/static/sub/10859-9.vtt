02:22.524 --> 02:23.819
Where are you?

02:23.820 --> 02:25.114
<i>(Danny)
Are you checking up on me?</i>

02:25.306 --> 02:26.393
You're late.

02:26.394 --> 02:27.480
<i>(Danny) Sorry, sir.</i>

02:27.732 --> 02:29.074
<i>(Danny) Stuck in traffic.</i>

02:29.194 --> 02:30.451
<i>(Lester) Oh, really?</i>

02:30.762 --> 02:33.446
So... What can I do you for?

02:33.604 --> 02:35.795
<i>(Lester) I'm meeting
the minister this afternoon.</i>

02:35.960 --> 02:37.273
He might be too late.

02:37.836 --> 02:38.799
Johnson's military.

02:38.800 --> 02:40.727
<i>(Lester) She can't storm in
without clearance.</i>

02:40.864 --> 02:42.517
Yes, sir.
I'm well aware of that.

02:42.682 --> 02:44.096
Based on a hunch
that she's got...

02:44.097 --> 02:46.708
<i>(Lester) ...an active anomaly
and some mysterious woman...</i>

02:46.709 --> 02:48.450
<i>(Lester) ...from the future
tucked away somewhere.</i>

02:53.703 --> 02:55.439
OK, sir.
You're the boss.

02:57.050 --> 02:59.317
You're in a very understanding mood
today, Quinn.

02:59.729 --> 03:01.981
<i>(Danny) The lights have changed.
I've got to run!</i>

03:02.282 --> 03:03.032
Quinn...

03:03.040 --> 03:04.732
<i>(Danny) Sorry, sir.
You're breaking up.</i>

03:04.886 --> 03:07.180
Don't do anything
I'll regret.

03:47.859 --> 03:48.859
(Door bell rings)

03:52.010 --> 03:53.010
(Door bell rings again)

03:55.560 --> 03:56.890
Hang on!

03:59.932 --> 04:01.510
DON'T ANSWER THE: FRONT DOOR.

04:04.511 --> 04:05.511
(Front door opened)

04:06.112 --> 04:07.112
- (Connor) Hi.
- (Abby) Hi.

04:08.992 --> 04:10.516
- (Connor) Come in.
- (Abby) OK.

04:11.879 --> 04:13.090
Follow me.

04:15.371 --> 04:17.130
You'd better come through.

04:20.978 --> 04:22.349
DON'T ANSWER THE PHONE.

04:23.735 --> 04:26.029
DON'T ASK ME WHY!

04:28.959 --> 04:30.620
I expect you're wondering
why I'm here.

04:36.621 --> 04:37.621
(Rex yelps)

04:43.917 --> 04:45.330
Rex was lonely.

04:46.990 --> 04:47.990
(Connor whistles)

04:47.991 --> 04:48.991
Guys!

04:54.066 --> 04:55.350
That's cute.

05:01.589 --> 05:02.787
I wanted to...

05:04.447 --> 05:06.096
I just don't want things
to be weird between us.

05:06.250 --> 05:07.414
Absolutely.

05:07.568 --> 05:10.297
Me neither.
Don't want any...

05:10.673 --> 05:12.231
(Connor)
Any sort of weirdness with...

05:13.988 --> 05:17.087
No weird areas here!

05:20.031 --> 05:21.588
I'm being weird,
aren't I?

05:21.724 --> 05:23.488
- Yeah.
- (Connor) Sorry.

05:23.889 --> 05:24.889
(Claws)

05:26.982 --> 05:30.622
I don't... I don't suppose
now Jack's moved out that...

05:31.358 --> 05:32.693
You know.

05:37.764 --> 05:38.928
They can move back in.

05:41.000 --> 05:43.521
Wicked.
That's great news.

05:43.676 --> 05:45.541
Because I think
their lives are in danger.

05:46.332 --> 05:47.619
(Connor) Living with Lester.

05:48.458 --> 05:49.749
Literally. I think he -

05:49.750 --> 05:50.750
Connor...

05:51.785 --> 05:52.560
It's fine.

05:53.987 --> 05:56.038
We've missed them anyway.

05:56.175 --> 05:57.202
Haven't we, Rex?

05:59.956 --> 06:01.120
See?

06:04.788 --> 06:06.370
Nice place.

06:17.183 --> 06:18.250
(Abby) You must love it here.

06:18.370 --> 06:20.388
Oh... Yeah!

06:22.597 --> 06:23.898
It's not home though, is it?

06:26.299 --> 06:27.299
Connor...

06:28.500 --> 06:29.500
(Anomaly detector beeps)

06:41.980 --> 06:45.728
<i>Anomaly alert! Where are you?</i>

07:10.537 --> 07:12.831
<i>(Christine) For the last time,
say your name.</i>

07:13.700 --> 07:16.815
My officers tell me when they found
you, you tried to run. Why?

07:18.504 --> 07:20.490
Who are you?
Who are you working for?

07:21.141 --> 07:22.989
(Christine) How did you come
to be there?

07:24.929 --> 07:26.332
Let me explain
something to you.

07:26.487 --> 07:28.227
You're not leaving
until I get some answers.

07:28.723 --> 07:29.845
(Christine) So unless
you really like it here,

07:29.846 --> 07:32.089
(Christine) I suggest
you start talking.

07:34.033 --> 07:35.330
Tell me.

07:38.670 --> 07:41.528
Everyone's dead. What difference
does it make who I am?

07:41.682 --> 07:43.138
You mean in the future?

07:46.105 --> 07:47.492
You know what happened?

07:47.612 --> 07:51.054
The predators.
They destroyed everything.

07:52.144 --> 07:53.755
And where did the predators
come from?

07:54.947 --> 07:56.728
I don't know.
I wish I did.

08:05.146 --> 08:07.146
(Chattering)

08:07.847 --> 08:10.325
(Man) Come on! He did it to me
on my stag weekend.

08:10.599 --> 08:12.621
(Man) So this is our chance
to get him back.

08:17.165 --> 08:18.770
Joe, come on!

08:24.025 --> 08:26.346
You promised me
no stunts, right?

08:26.524 --> 08:27.757
Just a boys weekend.

08:28.578 --> 08:30.452
Yeah, sure. No stunts.

08:32.677 --> 08:35.102
Oh, no.
Oh, come on, guys!

08:35.241 --> 08:37.335
(All together)
Go! Go!

08:43.167 --> 08:45.084
This isn't funny.

08:45.512 --> 08:47.256
Give them back!

08:47.838 --> 08:49.071
Guys!

08:50.745 --> 08:52.370
Guys!

09:03.293 --> 09:06.930
Wait! Get me... Yeah, very funny.
Are you...

09:09.628 --> 09:11.271
Gonna help me, or what?!

09:11.514 --> 09:13.280
(Joe) Guys, come back!
You can't leave me here!

09:14.481 --> 09:15.981
(Some animal roars)

09:18.982 --> 09:19.982
(Breaking twigs)

09:21.983 --> 09:23.483
(Animal roars again)

09:25.394 --> 09:26.569
Guys!

09:27.390 --> 09:29.102
Is that the best you can do?

09:30.203 --> 09:31.793
(Animal roars in close distance)

09:31.808 --> 09:32.708
Very funny.

09:32.709 --> 09:35.209
(Breaking twigs and animal roars)

09:42.803 --> 09:44.053
Oh, my god.

09:56.594 --> 09:57.594
(Joe) Guys!

10:10.064 --> 10:11.064
(Joe) Help!

10:37.403 --> 10:38.516
It's OK.

10:52.266 --> 10:54.081
(Christine)
Tell me what this is.

10:56.817 --> 10:59.386
I found it in the ruins,
but I have no idea what it is.

10:59.577 --> 11:01.497
- (Girl) I think it's broken.
- You're lying.

11:02.577 --> 11:04.751
- (Christine) What about anomalies?
- Anomalies? - Go on!

11:07.045 --> 11:08.955
Anomalies are...

11:09.109 --> 11:10.751
...rips in time.

11:13.729 --> 11:15.487
<i>(Girl) Some you can see.</i>

11:15.624 --> 11:17.490
Others are invisible
to the naked eye.

11:20.377 --> 11:21.800
They're everywhere.

11:22.014 --> 11:23.977
You just have to know
how to find them.

11:25.537 --> 11:27.279
And you know
how to do that?

11:30.047 --> 11:31.450
- Yes.
- How?

11:33.563 --> 11:35.026
I'll show you.

11:35.189 --> 11:37.534
But first, I have to go
to the Anomaly Research Centre.

11:39.588 --> 11:41.950
What do you know
about the ARC?

11:42.434 --> 11:43.941
<i>(Girl) Take me there
and I'll show you.</i>

11:44.215 --> 11:45.459
You don't give the
orders around here.

11:45.460 --> 11:47.947
Take me to the ARC,
then I'll help you.

12:17.722 --> 12:19.194
What's all this?

12:20.234 --> 12:22.637
The anomaly's somewhere
over there.

12:26.146 --> 12:27.943
(Connor) Strange.
My detector's gone all funny.

12:28.063 --> 12:29.723
- So has mine.
- (Connor) See?

12:30.477 --> 12:31.950
(Connor) Really weird.

12:33.397 --> 12:34.544
(Abby) Where's Danny?

12:35.177 --> 12:36.427
Where's Danny?

12:37.779 --> 12:39.257
I'm sure
he's on his way.

12:40.697 --> 12:42.375
Sausage, anyone?

12:42.376 --> 12:43.376
(Roars)

12:49.131 --> 12:51.017
Maybe later, right?

12:57.983 --> 12:58.983
<i>Ma'am.</i>

13:21.759 --> 13:22.974
Catch!

13:25.457 --> 13:26.655
Intruder!

13:26.792 --> 13:29.072
Get her back to her room.
(Alarm sounds inside)

13:31.160 --> 13:32.857
Come on, let's go.

13:51.358 --> 13:54.358
(Roars around)

14:11.985 --> 14:13.149
There's so many.

14:20.185 --> 14:21.683
Better get this place evacuated.

14:23.290 --> 14:24.573
They're incredible.

14:24.727 --> 14:27.056
- What are they?
- Embolotherium.

14:27.580 --> 14:30.524
They're um...
They're prehistoric rhinos.

14:30.730 --> 14:31.877
Peaceful grazers.

14:35.170 --> 14:37.960
Peaceful.
Are you sure about that?

14:38.097 --> 14:41.697
As sure as anybody can be on
the basis of a fossilised tooth.

14:49.318 --> 14:51.137
(Joe) Oh, come on,
little man!

14:52.519 --> 14:54.777
I'm trying to help you.
Just relax.

14:58.278 --> 15:00.278
(Alarm sounds continously)

15:14.796 --> 15:16.097
<i>(Outside) Over here!</i>

15:21.448 --> 15:22.448
(Danny whistles)

15:31.353 --> 15:32.817
Nice move.

15:35.444 --> 15:38.816
- I have to get out of here.
- I'm aware of that. Why the ARC?

15:39.205 --> 15:40.889
I have to warn them.

15:41.047 --> 15:42.737
<i>(Outside)
Go, go, go!</i>

15:47.402 --> 15:48.566
Come on.

15:54.737 --> 15:56.800
- What's going on?
- Danny Quinn.

15:57.440 --> 15:58.990
He's in the building.

16:06.835 --> 16:08.838
Lock down the building.
Find them.

16:11.286 --> 16:12.286
Dammit!

16:13.577 --> 16:15.206
(Danny) We're going to take
a quick detour.

16:15.343 --> 16:17.536
There isn't time.
I've got to get to...

16:26.212 --> 16:27.239
(Joe) Help!

16:27.907 --> 16:29.927
- (Sarah) There's someone in there.
- (Joe) Help me, please!

16:30.849 --> 16:32.560
- (Joe) Hello!
- Come on.

16:34.255 --> 16:35.539
(Connor) Through that lot?

16:35.866 --> 16:37.509
- Yeah.
- (Joe) I'm in the tent!

16:43.497 --> 16:45.377
I'm guessing that's the bull.

16:47.161 --> 16:48.085
Yeah.

16:48.205 --> 16:49.283
(Joe) Help!

16:51.286 --> 16:53.143
The bull's disrupting the herd.

16:53.383 --> 16:55.579
We can't risk going in
with him like this.

16:55.699 --> 16:57.654
Someone needs to distract him.

16:57.808 --> 16:59.068
Absolutely.

17:01.785 --> 17:03.291
- Me?
- (Joe) Somebody help me!

17:03.496 --> 17:05.328
- I'm not...
- Please.

17:07.348 --> 17:08.373
(Abby) Thanks.

17:09.636 --> 17:11.536
- (Connor whistles) Look at me!
- (Joe) Help me please!

17:11.540 --> 17:13.656
Come on!
Ignore the girls!

17:14.432 --> 17:16.463
OK, I've got his attention.

17:16.599 --> 17:18.435
- (Connor) He likes me.
- (Joe) Is there anyone there?!

17:18.571 --> 17:20.284
- (Joe) They've got me surrounded!
- Go! - Ok!

17:20.847 --> 17:21.847
Go!

17:22.268 --> 17:24.069
- Come on!
- We'll be fine.

17:28.737 --> 17:32.217
(Sarah) We should split up
and try and sneak through them.

17:35.842 --> 17:37.383
(Abby) Sarah, are you OK?

17:41.111 --> 17:42.138
I'm all right!

17:43.730 --> 17:45.057
(Sarah) Oh, god!

18:10.688 --> 18:13.817
- Are you OK?
- Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.

18:23.596 --> 18:24.596
(Connor) Hide.

18:42.205 --> 18:43.446
(Connor) Stop!

18:43.626 --> 18:45.441
Just stay there, don't panic!

18:54.042 --> 18:55.600
If we make no sudden...

18:58.082 --> 18:59.469
Remember me?

18:59.806 --> 19:01.158
Now you're looking at me.

19:21.615 --> 19:23.297
They're following the bull.

19:31.057 --> 19:35.657
(Baby animal yells)

19:35.758 --> 19:37.778
- What?
- (Abby) Sounds like a baby.

19:44.172 --> 19:45.937
- Hey.
- What?

19:47.887 --> 19:49.548
None of my business.

19:51.476 --> 19:53.359
It's my stag weekend.

19:54.072 --> 19:55.072
Right.

19:55.073 --> 19:56.073
(Baby yells again)

19:57.769 --> 20:01.050
What is it? And what are
those things out there?

20:01.255 --> 20:03.336
Let me get you out first,
and then we can chat.

20:04.189 --> 20:05.297
Wait a minute.

20:06.614 --> 20:08.479
You're not the stripper, are you?

20:08.992 --> 20:11.320
Do you want to get out of here
alive?

20:11.475 --> 20:12.475
Or not?

20:12.862 --> 20:13.862
Sorry.

20:24.638 --> 20:26.376
That's the baby, right?

20:27.179 --> 20:28.616
I guess so, yeah.

20:35.667 --> 20:37.653
What have you done
to yourself?

20:38.673 --> 20:42.045
(Abby) Listen, don't worry.
We're going to get you out of here.

20:42.447 --> 20:43.897
(Abby) I promise.

20:45.083 --> 20:47.137
Do I look like a stripper?

20:48.702 --> 20:51.321
- Well...
- Don't answer that.

20:55.561 --> 20:58.026
(Sarah) Abby, it's the mother
coming back!

20:59.527 --> 21:00.527
Abby!

21:01.312 --> 21:04.056
(Sarah) She's heading for the tent, Abby!
You've gotta get out of there!

21:04.797 --> 21:06.218
(Sarah) Come on, Abby!

21:07.981 --> 21:10.577
(Abby) You're going to have to help me
get this calf out of here, OK?

21:29.210 --> 21:30.210
Sorry.

21:30.348 --> 21:32.137
She's going round the other side!

21:34.302 --> 21:36.699
You've got to calm the cow down!

21:36.969 --> 21:39.736
She's going to kill us
and the calf at this rate!

21:47.771 --> 21:49.141
Easy.

21:50.161 --> 21:51.496
Easy.

21:56.014 --> 21:57.829
OK, calm down.

22:01.177 --> 22:03.497
One, two, three!

22:12.464 --> 22:14.210
Calm down.
Slowly.

22:17.365 --> 22:18.392
(Sarah) Slowly.

22:37.061 --> 22:38.567
- Are you all right?
- (Abby) Yeah.

22:41.391 --> 22:42.710
Sweet.

22:47.300 --> 22:48.721
Not him.

22:49.252 --> 22:50.116
Them.

22:50.236 --> 22:52.282
What have you been
doing in there?

22:52.945 --> 22:54.691
Never mind.

22:55.693 --> 22:56.703
No.

23:09.014 --> 23:10.195
Come on!

23:22.143 --> 23:24.377
(Becker) Here you go, mate.
You'll be fine now.

23:25.143 --> 23:26.457
Cheers.

23:29.992 --> 23:31.567
(Joe) So... thanks...

23:32.490 --> 23:34.617
...for saving me from those...

23:36.287 --> 23:38.666
The rhinos.
Rare species.

23:40.336 --> 23:42.596
By the way, is...

23:44.796 --> 23:46.011
Is this yours?

23:49.213 --> 23:50.213
Yeah.

23:54.417 --> 23:56.337
- Thanks.
- It's all right.

24:06.186 --> 24:07.777
-(Abby) What?
- Nothing.

24:08.012 --> 24:09.399
In your own time.

24:09.655 --> 24:11.277
Anyone got any immediate ideas...

24:11.397 --> 24:15.020
...on how we get a herd of prehistoric
rhinos back through the anomaly?

24:15.174 --> 24:16.671
Good question.

24:30.936 --> 24:32.417
(Abby) Down there.

24:33.567 --> 24:36.306
Really gently.
That's great.

24:37.521 --> 24:39.610
- What are we doing here?
- I don't know.

24:41.527 --> 24:43.264
Right.
Stay here.

24:44.492 --> 24:45.733
We're wasting time!

24:45.734 --> 24:48.215
Look, this is important,
right? Stay there.

24:54.448 --> 24:57.217
- Quinn, who is she?
- Long story.

24:58.091 --> 24:59.137
Where's Connor?

25:20.375 --> 25:21.830
It's worked!

25:22.104 --> 25:23.234
They're going through.

25:23.388 --> 25:24.518
- Well done.
- Good job.

25:24.638 --> 25:25.638
(Abby) Thanks!

25:42.647 --> 25:46.137
The anomaly is closing! We need
to get them back through faster!

25:50.332 --> 25:51.822
You're going to hit it!

25:53.790 --> 25:55.519
That's the general idea.

25:55.690 --> 25:57.149
Come on, ladies!

26:02.342 --> 26:04.951
(Abby) You've got to get the bull
through the anomaly - now!

26:05.455 --> 26:07.320
I'm driving
as fast as I can!

26:11.121 --> 26:12.121
(Sarah) Abby...

26:16.259 --> 26:17.303
Oh, no.

26:20.713 --> 26:21.713
Connor...

26:21.714 --> 26:23.089
<i>(Abby) Keep the bull away!</i>

26:23.090 --> 26:24.007
What?

26:25.017 --> 26:26.790
The anomaly has closed.

26:27.057 --> 26:28.411
Too late!

26:43.700 --> 26:45.177
They're heading
for the campsite.

26:45.297 --> 26:47.697
We've got to get those people away.
Let's go!

27:00.948 --> 27:02.968
- All right, mate?
- Yeah, it's good.

27:15.429 --> 27:17.825
(Danny) We've got to get them
to change direction.

27:27.514 --> 27:29.267
Are you insane?!

27:29.387 --> 27:31.554
It depends who you ask. Hold tight.

27:37.383 --> 27:39.214
I think it's thunder.

27:40.207 --> 27:42.895
- They're too big!
- Have you got a better idea?

27:48.869 --> 27:50.752
You told Johnson
you didn't know what that was.

27:50.889 --> 27:52.651
- Get me to the campsite.
- What is that thing?

27:52.772 --> 27:55.147
I'll explain later.
Just take me there now!

28:10.259 --> 28:12.227
- (Man#1) Did you lot hear that?
- (Man#2) Yeah.

28:23.489 --> 28:25.458
You've got to
get out of here!

28:25.612 --> 28:27.662
Come on, everyone!
Get out!

28:29.105 --> 28:30.627
(Connor)
Go! Go! Go!

28:32.982 --> 28:34.227
(Danny) Stay calm.

28:37.415 --> 28:38.787
(Danny) On your feet! Go!

28:44.810 --> 28:46.077
Get out!

28:47.661 --> 28:48.706
(Abby) Move!

28:49.151 --> 28:52.227
- (Abby) Everyone, move!
- You haven't got time. Come on!

28:56.051 --> 28:57.352
Everybody out!

29:05.315 --> 29:06.393
No!

29:07.044 --> 29:08.910
Becker, stop!

29:12.808 --> 29:15.491
If you're going to do something,
now would be a good time!

29:47.939 --> 29:49.172
How did you do that?

29:51.354 --> 29:53.817
- The technology is simple enough.
- Really?

29:54.572 --> 29:55.856
Try me.

29:56.010 --> 29:57.499
Another time.

29:58.442 --> 30:00.227
(Connor) I don't believe that.

30:02.765 --> 30:04.737
Now will you help me?
Please.

30:04.891 --> 30:07.720
I have to get a message
to a man called James Lester.

30:09.547 --> 30:12.253
I'm taking her to the ARC.
We'll meet you there.

30:12.444 --> 30:14.074
I don't understand.

30:16.133 --> 30:17.708
Just get in the car.

30:19.116 --> 30:20.648
Look, this is her book.

30:20.785 --> 30:22.431
- (Danny) See what you make of it.
- Yeah, sure.

30:22.568 --> 30:24.228
Abby, you come with me.

30:45.675 --> 30:47.986
(Danny) I'm bringing someone
in to meet you.

30:48.175 --> 30:49.475
Who?

30:50.083 --> 30:52.342
Out with it, Quinn.
You know I hate...

30:53.002 --> 30:54.227
...surprises.

30:55.301 --> 30:56.451
Hello, James.

30:56.452 --> 30:57.452
Christine.

30:58.365 --> 31:02.062
I'd like to say it was always a pleasure,
but that would be a bare-faced lie.

31:05.824 --> 31:07.125
What's this?

31:07.366 --> 31:09.711
A warrant for the arrest
of Danny Quinn.

31:12.317 --> 31:14.166
What is it
that he's supposed to have done?

31:14.354 --> 31:16.913
We'll start with breaking and
entering and kidnapping.

31:17.534 --> 31:20.102
You did know he broke into
my HQ this morning.

31:23.141 --> 31:27.048
Oh, you didn't. You really need
to get a grip, James.

31:27.407 --> 31:29.575
Make sure you read
all the way through.

31:29.995 --> 31:31.745
I wouldn't want you to miss
the part which requires...

31:31.865 --> 31:34.147
...the immediate surrender
of the artefact to me.

31:37.186 --> 31:38.350
So...

31:39.651 --> 31:41.427
Where is she?

31:49.287 --> 31:50.287
Where is who?

31:59.372 --> 32:00.907
Hey. Well?

32:01.027 --> 32:02.147
Well what?

32:02.386 --> 32:04.342
- (Connor) Can you crack it?
- It's not a code.

32:04.479 --> 32:07.462
Just loads of charts
and diary entries.

32:07.616 --> 32:08.954
What does it say?

32:09.108 --> 32:11.028
Not much. Look.

32:11.251 --> 32:12.667
333 here,

32:12.787 --> 32:14.287
here,

32:14.427 --> 32:15.427
here.

32:15.627 --> 32:17.860
There's times, places...

32:17.980 --> 32:21.146
I'm going to have to read all of it.
See if it makes any sense.

32:28.347 --> 32:30.386
- The boss would like to see you.
- Now?

32:30.523 --> 32:32.334
- Now.
- You stay here.

32:32.453 --> 32:33.541
Watch her.

32:45.876 --> 32:47.343
Fascinating.

32:47.548 --> 32:48.746
What is?

32:50.341 --> 32:51.467
All this.

32:53.080 --> 32:54.741
Must be strange for you.

32:56.418 --> 32:57.428
Very.

32:58.559 --> 32:59.655
Don't touch it.

33:06.035 --> 33:07.713
Why are you looking
at me like that?

33:09.784 --> 33:11.205
I thought...

33:14.012 --> 33:15.012
(Abby) Nothing.

33:16.156 --> 33:17.971
My eyes playing tricks on me.

33:21.352 --> 33:22.910
Been a long day.

33:24.211 --> 33:26.427
Believe me,
it's only just beginning.

33:29.535 --> 33:31.022
Where is she?

33:31.193 --> 33:32.021
Who?

33:32.022 --> 33:33.678
(Christine) I suggest you
co-operate immediately, Quinn.

33:33.824 --> 33:36.872
Or I'll personally see to it that
you spend a very long time in jail.

33:37.002 --> 33:39.027
You're really going to have to work
on your small talk.

33:39.147 --> 33:40.684
Where is she?

33:41.438 --> 33:43.990
I don't know. Your guess
is as good as mine.

33:44.137 --> 33:47.583
Even if I have to go to the ends
of the Earth, I'll find her.

33:49.914 --> 33:52.971
I assume we're talking about
a certain mystery woman.

33:53.147 --> 33:55.787
Quinn knows exactly
who I'm talking about.

34:01.307 --> 34:03.267
(Lester) She's downstairs,
isn't she?

34:03.749 --> 34:06.482
- (Danny) Yeah.
- Nice work. Subtle.

34:12.992 --> 34:14.690
I thought I told you
to stay away from her.

34:14.810 --> 34:16.625
I was using my initiative.

34:17.476 --> 34:20.208
And it's all turned out
so well, hasn't it?

34:24.536 --> 34:27.043
Mate, turn this around.
Cheers.

34:27.219 --> 34:28.306
Guys!

34:28.746 --> 34:30.239
Have a look at this.

34:33.020 --> 34:33.907
Claudia Brown.

34:34.027 --> 34:36.827
Of all the names that could have
been here, why that one?

34:36.947 --> 34:39.547
- Coincidence?
- I don't believe in coincidence any more.

34:39.667 --> 34:41.627
- Who's Claudia Brown?
- Hang on.

34:42.867 --> 34:46.867
There's only two people in the world
apart us who knew about Claudia Brown.

34:47.522 --> 34:50.121
- One was Cutter and the other...
- Come on!

34:57.467 --> 34:59.258
I know this might sound weird,

34:59.386 --> 35:01.126
but have we met?

35:05.297 --> 35:06.903
Wouldn't you remember me?

35:07.505 --> 35:08.692
Suppose so.

35:11.748 --> 35:14.227
Of course, people change.

35:14.781 --> 35:15.854
What are you doing?

35:15.855 --> 35:17.464
(Christine) I wouldn't
do that if I were you.

35:19.740 --> 35:22.106
My, you have been busy.

35:23.814 --> 35:25.347
What's going on?

35:27.784 --> 35:29.849
Thanks for bringing me here, Danny.

35:30.255 --> 35:32.672
I don't know how I would have
done it without you.

35:37.507 --> 35:39.507
(Girl)
You know nothing.

35:42.537 --> 35:45.123
Now give me the artefact
or she dies.

35:45.959 --> 35:47.195
Helen?

35:57.176 --> 35:58.383
It's close enough!

35:59.227 --> 36:00.426
Back off!

36:12.507 --> 36:14.667
There's no way out, Helen.

36:15.938 --> 36:17.947
I killed Nick.

36:18.535 --> 36:19.947
You know
I'm not bluffing.

36:20.067 --> 36:22.542
And you know I have
absolutely no intention...

36:22.662 --> 36:24.495
...of letting you
walk out of here.

36:24.642 --> 36:26.986
Playing games
with her life, James.

36:29.066 --> 36:30.676
Go ahead.
Shoot her.

36:31.773 --> 36:33.724
- Perfectly fine with me.
- That is not funny.

36:34.914 --> 36:36.707
Depends
where you're standing.

36:44.853 --> 36:46.507
Lower your weapons.

36:48.358 --> 36:49.358
(Lester) Connor...

36:51.018 --> 36:52.856
Give her the artefact.

36:53.347 --> 36:55.307
- No.
- Do it.

36:56.415 --> 36:58.269
(Lester)
Can't let her kill Christine.

36:58.661 --> 37:00.629
Contravenes health and safety.

37:01.447 --> 37:03.105
In any case,
she won't get far.

37:10.707 --> 37:13.227
Just... tell me how.

37:16.253 --> 37:17.537
How you could...

37:17.667 --> 37:19.911
...kill your own husband.

37:20.172 --> 37:21.867
I had no choice.

37:24.347 --> 37:26.307
I loved him, Connor.

37:28.508 --> 37:30.248
But he was part of all this.

37:31.846 --> 37:34.627
Part of everything
that goes wrong.

37:35.226 --> 37:38.056
This is the beginning
of the chaos.

37:39.293 --> 37:40.919
(Helen)
It all starts here.

37:43.570 --> 37:45.267
What are you talking about?

37:45.570 --> 37:48.400
I thought that killing Nick
would be enough, but it wasn't.

37:48.790 --> 37:51.294
So now I have to finish it
once and for all.

37:56.157 --> 37:58.368
You follow, she's dead!

38:04.307 --> 38:06.467
You really think
I'm frightened of you?

38:06.925 --> 38:08.780
I really think
I'm aware of that.

38:15.173 --> 38:17.107
Take the artefact and leave.

38:17.797 --> 38:19.678
I'll make sure
no-one follows you.

38:19.857 --> 38:21.810
Is that the best
you can do?

38:39.273 --> 38:41.533
So where exactly
are you planning on taking me?

38:41.663 --> 38:43.484
You've not worked it out yet?

38:44.476 --> 38:47.747
I'm surprised. I thought you were
supposed to be intelligent.

39:04.421 --> 39:05.964
What are we doing here?

39:06.110 --> 39:09.550
I have snipers all over this building.
They'll shoot you on sight.

39:09.680 --> 39:11.909
- I don't think so.
- Listen Helen, we're on the same side.

39:12.028 --> 39:14.305
We have the same goals.
We can share all of this.

39:14.425 --> 39:17.272
We have the artefact, control of the
anomalies. Think of the power.

39:17.418 --> 39:19.711
If you think this is about power,
you're wrong.

39:21.065 --> 39:23.364
- Then what is it about?
- It's all about you.

39:24.356 --> 39:25.754
You started this.

39:26.722 --> 39:30.010
One ambitious little civil servant
who ends the world.

39:30.644 --> 39:32.107
What are you talking about?

39:33.358 --> 39:35.507
I've seen the future.

39:36.577 --> 39:38.983
(Helen)
And it's all your fault.

39:42.227 --> 39:43.548
Never mind.

39:44.633 --> 39:46.665
(Helen) None of it
is going to happen anyway.

39:47.427 --> 39:48.716
None of it.

39:55.107 --> 39:56.976
- Out of the way!
- Do as she says!

40:28.188 --> 40:30.507
What are you going to do?
You've got what you want.

40:30.627 --> 40:32.627
Didn't I tell you?
You're coming too.

40:33.499 --> 40:35.227
No.
Not through there.

40:35.525 --> 40:37.330
What are you frightened of,
Christine?

40:37.444 --> 40:40.387
After all,
it's a world you made.

40:56.307 --> 40:58.449
- It's too late.
- (Connor) She's gone.

40:58.596 --> 41:00.114
What about Johnson?

41:06.009 --> 41:08.562
- Help me!
- I've got you. You're safe.
