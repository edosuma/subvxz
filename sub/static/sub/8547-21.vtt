WEBVTT

00:05.603 --> 00:09.575
Look, there's been some kind
of misunderstanding, all right?

00:09.577 --> 00:11.310
I'm innocent!

00:11.312 --> 00:13.105
I didn't--I--

00:13.107 --> 00:16.600
I couldn't do this!

00:16.602 --> 00:19.980
Will someone please
listen to me!

00:24.351 --> 00:25.820
Who are you?

00:25.822 --> 00:27.716
I'm Agent Hotchner,
Mr. Merrin.

00:27.718 --> 00:29.851
Have you been advised
of your rights?

00:29.853 --> 00:32.353
Yeah.

00:32.354 --> 00:34.754
Do you know where you are?

00:36.263 --> 00:38.575
Some FBI place, right?

00:38.577 --> 00:41.546
You're at the Behavioral
Analysis Unit in Quantico, Virginia.

00:41.548 --> 00:43.487
You know why you're here?

00:43.489 --> 00:45.794
Because you think
I'm a killer.

00:45.796 --> 00:47.427
Are you a killer?

00:47.429 --> 00:48.564
No.

00:48.566 --> 00:51.133
Why won't anybody believe me?
I am not--

00:51.135 --> 00:53.102
Stop.

00:53.104 --> 00:54.940
Sit down.

01:00.645 --> 01:02.841
Take a deep breath.

01:04.913 --> 01:08.079
I want you to tell me exactly
what happened two nights ago.

01:08.081 --> 01:10.141
Don't leave anything out.
Can you do that?

01:10.143 --> 01:14.081
Yeah.
Yeah, I can do that.

01:16.980 --> 01:21.154
So, uh, me and...

01:21.156 --> 01:24.122
me and my wife Tabitha,

01:24.124 --> 01:27.092
we were getting ready
for bed and she says...

01:27.094 --> 01:28.865
I think I heard something,

01:28.867 --> 01:30.306
downstairs.

01:30.308 --> 01:32.373
Again?
Maybe outside.

01:32.375 --> 01:35.583
It's--it's a dog or a cat or squirrel
or something.

01:35.585 --> 01:36.920
It's nothing.

01:36.922 --> 01:38.854
Go.

01:42.067 --> 01:43.729
So I did.

01:45.000 --> 01:51.074
Advertise your product or brand here

01:53.839 --> 01:57.443
I checked the front door
and it was fine.

01:59.076 --> 02:01.144
Everything was fine.

02:02.148 --> 02:04.378
Until...

02:04.380 --> 02:08.985
Until I--I smelled
like...sage.

02:08.987 --> 02:10.553
Sage?

02:10.555 --> 02:14.385
Like the burning sage.

02:14.387 --> 02:16.722
'Cause that's when I...

02:39.193 --> 02:40.831
Tabitha?!

02:40.833 --> 02:42.462
Hold on! I'm--

02:45.969 --> 02:47.568
Aah!

02:50.909 --> 02:52.780
A shadow monster?

02:52.782 --> 02:54.782
Yeah.

02:54.784 --> 02:56.784
With talons for hands?

02:56.786 --> 02:59.193
I know how it sounds.

02:59.195 --> 03:03.128
I--I knew I needed
to get upstairs,

03:03.130 --> 03:06.159
because...

03:07.329 --> 03:09.464
Because I--I--

03:09.466 --> 03:12.272
I could
hear her screaming.

03:12.274 --> 03:13.808
Larry, no!

03:13.810 --> 03:16.811
Larry, please, stop!

03:18.583 --> 03:20.014
No! No! No!

03:20.016 --> 03:23.023
No! No! Larry, please!

03:23.025 --> 03:25.422
No! Larry, no!

03:25.424 --> 03:27.787
Please don't! Larry, no!

03:30.092 --> 03:31.257
Stop, Larry!

03:31.259 --> 03:33.060
Stop! Aah!

03:47.875 --> 03:49.345
I passed out,

03:49.347 --> 03:52.714
and when I woke up,
the cops had arrested me.

03:54.149 --> 03:55.884
I didn't do it.

03:55.886 --> 03:59.755
I swear to God, it is
exactly what happened.

03:59.757 --> 04:01.692
No, it's not.

04:01.694 --> 04:03.124
Yes, it is.

04:03.126 --> 04:05.792
Mr. Merrin, what happened
was you took a kitchen knife

04:05.794 --> 04:07.359
and you stabbed
your wife to death.

04:07.361 --> 04:08.959
No, no.

04:08.961 --> 04:11.895
Neighbors heard the screaming
and they called 911,

04:11.897 --> 04:14.496
and when the police arrived,
they found you still on the bed

04:14.498 --> 04:15.737
holding the knife.

04:15.739 --> 04:17.200
I didn't do that.

04:17.202 --> 04:19.007
You've been scratching
yourself, Mr. Merrin.

04:19.009 --> 04:21.541
Are you aware of that?

04:21.543 --> 04:23.604
Open your shirt
and you will see why.

04:26.509 --> 04:29.506
That's--that's from
the shadow monster.

04:29.508 --> 04:31.042
No, that's from your wife.

04:31.044 --> 04:33.114
Forensics matched your skin
under her fingernails

04:33.116 --> 04:35.913
as she fought to keep you
from killing her.

04:35.915 --> 04:38.414
Think back to the words
she was screaming.

04:38.416 --> 04:42.179
Larry, please, please,
please! Larry!

04:44.186 --> 04:45.184
Larry...

04:45.186 --> 04:47.279
Why would I do that?

04:48.785 --> 04:52.623
Do you recognize
either of these people?

04:52.625 --> 04:54.623
No, I--no.

04:54.625 --> 04:58.294
This is Daniel Karras
and this is Christine McNeil.

04:58.296 --> 05:00.632
Each of them claims to have
been attacked in their homes

05:00.634 --> 05:02.098
by a shadowy figure.

05:02.100 --> 05:05.273
When in reality, Daniel
stabbed his mother to death

05:05.275 --> 05:06.936
and Christine her boyfriend.

05:06.938 --> 05:10.842
And like you, they have no
recollection of the murders.

05:10.844 --> 05:13.283
What does it mean?

05:13.285 --> 05:14.779
It means that someone
found a way

05:14.781 --> 05:17.050
to induce a psychotic break
in the 3 of you.

05:17.052 --> 05:19.186
Why--why us? Why me?

05:19.188 --> 05:21.490
Well, that's why you're here
instead of a holding cell in Topeka,

05:21.492 --> 05:24.826
so my team can answer
that question.

05:24.828 --> 05:26.322
Agent Hotchner.

05:28.730 --> 05:30.424
I'm not a murderer.

05:30.426 --> 05:31.791
Yes, you are.

05:31.793 --> 05:34.093
And I'm going to find out
who turned you into one.

06:17.571 --> 06:20.703
Why don't we just start
with the simplest explanation?

06:20.705 --> 06:21.840
They're lying.

06:21.842 --> 06:24.240
There are easier lies
to tell to cover for murder.

06:24.242 --> 06:26.912
Why tell the same one, especially
when it doesn't make sense?

06:26.914 --> 06:28.311
Could it be
a group delusion?

06:28.313 --> 06:30.615
Their similar age range
all points in that direction,

06:30.617 --> 06:31.804
33 to 34 years old,

06:31.828 --> 06:34.026
but the geographic diversity
kind of rules that out.

06:34.090 --> 06:36.717
Yeah. Larry Merrin's
from Topeka.

06:36.719 --> 06:39.085
Christine McNeil is from
Roswell, Georgia,

06:39.087 --> 06:41.495
Daniel Karras
is from Derry, Maine,

06:41.497 --> 06:43.761
all different economic
levels, social circles,

06:43.763 --> 06:45.931
obviously different
racial backgrounds.

06:45.933 --> 06:48.499
So if he's an unsub,
he's not killing but creating killers.

06:48.501 --> 06:50.970
Murder by proxy,
if you will.

06:50.972 --> 06:52.304
It's gotta be drugs.

06:52.306 --> 06:54.239
Larry Merrin's story
just sounds like a bad trip.

06:54.241 --> 06:56.774
According to the police reports,
all 3 tox screens came up negative.

06:56.776 --> 06:58.440
Well, they only screen
for known compounds.

06:58.442 --> 07:00.280
This could be a cocktail
we've never seen before.

07:00.282 --> 07:02.448
Every drug affects
every person differently,

07:02.450 --> 07:05.121
yet somehow this unsub
is able to make his drug

07:05.123 --> 07:08.617
affect 3 completely dissimilar people
exactly in the same way.

07:08.619 --> 07:10.121
Maybe they're not
dissimilar at all.

07:10.123 --> 07:11.793
Maybe the drugs are
just the tipping point

07:11.795 --> 07:14.657
and these 3 share some
sort of pre-existing mental condition

07:14.659 --> 07:17.331
he knows he can tap into
to induce them to kill.

07:17.333 --> 07:20.405
We find that, we find him.

07:27.176 --> 07:30.980
Did she feel a lot of pain?

07:30.982 --> 07:33.750
Did I kill her quickly?

07:34.858 --> 07:37.992
Mr. Karras, we want to get
to the bottom of this, too.

07:37.994 --> 07:41.064
So we'd like to take you through
a cognitive interview.

07:42.034 --> 07:43.464
What's the point?

07:43.466 --> 07:46.465
It could help you remember details
you couldn't before.

07:46.467 --> 07:50.541
And those details could help us
understand what happened.

07:50.543 --> 07:52.077
So, please.

07:53.545 --> 07:56.247
Close your eyes.

07:59.786 --> 08:04.128
And put yourself
back in your home a week ago.

08:04.130 --> 08:08.158
You got home from
work early, right?

08:08.160 --> 08:10.063
Right.

08:10.065 --> 08:13.471
How did you feel when you walked
through the door?

08:15.537 --> 08:17.038
Happy.

08:20.313 --> 08:22.807
Hey, Ma.

08:22.809 --> 08:24.342
Hey, Ma, you home?

08:24.344 --> 08:26.612
She wasn't.
And then I remembered

08:26.614 --> 08:31.146
she said that she was
going to the movies with some friends.

08:31.148 --> 08:33.148
I thought my beer
tasted funny.

08:33.150 --> 08:35.486
And then I realized
it wasn't my beer,

08:35.489 --> 08:37.792
that it was a smell that was coming
from somewhere else.

08:37.794 --> 08:39.328
What was the smell?

08:39.331 --> 08:40.866
Sage.

08:42.931 --> 08:44.967
You're sure about that?

08:44.969 --> 08:49.503
Yeah. Yeah, because
once I placed it,

08:49.505 --> 08:51.175
I was out.

08:53.410 --> 08:56.312
How long
were you out?

08:56.314 --> 08:57.616
I don't know.

08:57.618 --> 08:59.617
All I know
is that when I came to,

08:59.619 --> 09:02.720
it was dark
and I couldn't move.

09:10.195 --> 09:12.097
Help!

09:15.331 --> 09:17.401
Somebody help me!

09:17.403 --> 09:19.505
Help!

09:36.687 --> 09:39.388
It did sexual things to me.

09:53.835 --> 09:59.035
He had these--these--
these talons for hands,

09:59.037 --> 10:01.002
and...

10:05.304 --> 10:09.510
Uh, I got--I got free
and then I, um...

10:09.512 --> 10:12.045
And then I hid
somewhere in the house,

10:12.047 --> 10:14.613
and, uh...

10:15.718 --> 10:17.012
Next thing I remember,

10:17.014 --> 10:19.052
I was standing over
my mom's body...

10:22.724 --> 10:25.618
And the cops
were cuffing me.

10:27.060 --> 10:29.057
I...

10:29.059 --> 10:32.055
So...So, I--

10:32.057 --> 10:34.927
maybe--maybe--you know,
maybe the rape,

10:34.929 --> 10:36.800
you know, uh...

10:36.802 --> 10:38.264
Maybe I snapped.

10:38.266 --> 10:40.103
You know?
You know what I mean?

10:40.105 --> 10:42.869
Maybe I snapped
and, uh, I lashed out

10:42.871 --> 10:44.605
at the first person
that I saw.

10:44.607 --> 10:46.237
Mr. Karras--

10:46.239 --> 10:47.806
because this is the only
way that it makes sense.

10:47.808 --> 10:49.174
At your lawyer's insistence,
the Maine police

10:49.176 --> 10:50.543
ran a rape kit on you.

10:50.545 --> 10:53.783
There was no evidence of assault,
sexual or otherwise.

10:53.785 --> 10:56.487
Ok, well,
run another rape kit.

10:56.489 --> 10:59.621
No rope burns
on your arms or legs.

10:59.623 --> 11:01.149
No evidence
of a break-in at all.

11:01.151 --> 11:02.388
What you guys trying
to tell me,

11:02.390 --> 11:05.753
that this didn't happen
to me? 'Cause it did!

11:13.365 --> 11:15.498
There are others.

11:15.500 --> 11:16.961
Excuse me?

11:16.963 --> 11:20.600
My lawyer said that there were others
that this happened to.

11:20.602 --> 11:22.566
That's right.

11:22.568 --> 11:25.500
Well, can I talk to them?

11:25.502 --> 11:27.900
No.

11:27.902 --> 11:29.801
Why not?

11:39.544 --> 11:41.878
Christine?

11:41.880 --> 11:43.953
Christine?

11:45.219 --> 11:46.719
Can you just blink

11:46.721 --> 11:49.683
if you understand
what we're saying?

11:51.156 --> 11:53.687
Georgia police say
that she started to tell the story

11:53.689 --> 11:55.950
of being attacked
by a dark figure

11:55.952 --> 11:58.116
and then stopped
and started doing this.

11:58.118 --> 12:00.586
Can you blame her?

12:00.588 --> 12:03.090
Sir. I'm sorry,
it's urgent.

12:03.092 --> 12:04.857
No, it's all right.

12:04.859 --> 12:06.257
Do what you can.

12:06.259 --> 12:09.424
Yeah, sure.
I'll just, uh...

12:12.665 --> 12:13.959
I did some digging.

12:13.961 --> 12:16.200
All 3 of our victims
were adopted

12:16.202 --> 12:17.832
and all in 1985.
All of them.

12:17.834 --> 12:19.135
From where?

12:19.137 --> 12:21.101
That's the thing.
It's from different states,

12:21.103 --> 12:22.973
they were closed adoptions,
it's pre-Internet.

12:22.975 --> 12:25.470
I gotta go through
the analog rabbit hole.

12:25.472 --> 12:26.639
It'll take a while.

12:26.641 --> 12:28.208
All right, Rossi and Reid
just landed in Topeka

12:28.210 --> 12:29.815
to walk the crime scene,
and I want you to reach out

12:29.817 --> 12:32.150
to the family members and find out
if there's any shared history

12:32.152 --> 12:33.981
In the foster care system.
Sir, yes, sir.

12:33.983 --> 12:35.316
Thank you.

12:41.789 --> 12:45.155
No records or paperwork in the house
regarding Larry Merrin's adoption.

12:45.157 --> 12:46.828
Morgan struck out
with the vics.

12:46.830 --> 12:47.997
They knew
they were adopted

12:47.999 --> 12:49.495
but couldn't
recall anything.

12:49.497 --> 12:51.333
Well, they were 3 to 4
years old at the time.

12:51.335 --> 12:54.700
Firm memories don't imprint on the
developing brain until about age 5.

12:54.702 --> 12:57.603
Yet somehow the unsub
was able to make the victims

12:57.605 --> 13:00.603
hallucinate an almost primal
childhood fear of the dark

13:00.605 --> 13:02.812
and of the monsters
that lurk within it.

13:02.814 --> 13:05.307
Yeah, but how?
This place was locked up tight.

13:05.309 --> 13:07.644
Well, both men reported
smelling sage.

13:07.646 --> 13:09.981
They must have inhaled
a drug.

13:09.983 --> 13:11.989
They had to
breathe it in.

13:30.782 --> 13:32.448
Anything?

13:39.395 --> 13:43.098
The plastic tested positive
for sevoflurane and scopolamine,

13:43.100 --> 13:45.001
both powerful
disassociatives.

13:45.003 --> 13:47.503
The first is used
to put you into a waking dream.

13:47.505 --> 13:49.670
Dentists often use it
during oral surgery.

13:49.672 --> 13:52.974
The second, in high doses,
makes you completely suggestible.

13:52.976 --> 13:56.235
And the unsub uses the first to make
the victims hallucinate their worst fear.

13:56.237 --> 13:58.443
Then he uses the second
to make them attack that fear

13:58.445 --> 14:00.275
when it's really
the person next to them.

14:00.277 --> 14:02.709
They don't realize that they're actually
killing someone that they love.

14:02.711 --> 14:04.950
And once they do, their
lives are ruined forever.

14:04.952 --> 14:07.053
Even if they plead insanity,
we've got 3 victims

14:07.055 --> 14:09.085
who ain't never
goin' back to Mayberry.

14:09.087 --> 14:11.389
Let's go back to the part
about hallucinating your worst fear.

14:11.391 --> 14:13.093
JJ, what's your earliest
fear from childhood?

14:13.095 --> 14:15.125
Being separated
from my parents.

14:15.127 --> 14:16.157
Dave?

14:16.159 --> 14:17.725
Lon Chaney,
“Phantom of the Opera.”

14:17.727 --> 14:19.165
she takes off that mask,
forget about it.

14:19.167 --> 14:20.133
Kate?

14:20.135 --> 14:22.133
Melissa Gordner.
That bitch.

14:22.135 --> 14:25.135
And yet each of these
victims saw exactly the same thing.

14:25.137 --> 14:28.073
The initial police reports
only called it a dark figure,

14:28.075 --> 14:30.314
but our interviews revealed
shared details.

14:30.316 --> 14:32.979
A shadow monster
with talons for hands.

14:32.981 --> 14:34.387
And that level
of specificity says

14:34.389 --> 14:35.987
it's not just
a childhood nightmare,

14:35.989 --> 14:37.491
it's something they
actually experienced,

14:37.493 --> 14:39.291
though they were too young
to understand what it was.

14:39.293 --> 14:41.027
But they were
from different states.

14:41.029 --> 14:42.323
No, they were adopted in
different states.

14:42.325 --> 14:44.258
Maybe at some point
they shared the same group home.

14:44.260 --> 14:46.666
So the unsub has them
recall that memory from childhood

14:46.668 --> 14:49.667
to make them kill as adults.
How do we prove it?

14:56.144 --> 14:59.417
Can you draw me
what you saw?

15:45.862 --> 15:47.229
Dad?

15:47.231 --> 15:48.661
Huh?

15:48.663 --> 15:50.936
Bogeyman's in my room again.

15:50.938 --> 15:52.276
There's no such thing.

15:52.278 --> 15:54.342
Go to bed.

15:54.344 --> 15:56.584
Will you check?

16:00.454 --> 16:03.358
Come on.

16:09.170 --> 16:11.673
Is there a bogeyman in here?

16:11.675 --> 16:15.471
If there is,
you have to leave.

16:20.679 --> 16:23.675
How about down here?

16:23.677 --> 16:26.881
Cast him out, Dad.

16:26.883 --> 16:28.512
Bogeyman,

16:28.514 --> 16:31.413
I cast you out!

16:31.415 --> 16:33.716
I think we're good.

16:39.357 --> 16:41.691
Do you have
a bogeyman, Dad?

16:41.693 --> 16:46.660
Yeah. He's called FICA
and he haunts my paycheck.

16:46.662 --> 16:48.995
Yeah, don't worry about that.

16:48.997 --> 16:53.270
Listen, we can't do this
every night, Bud.

16:53.272 --> 16:55.776
I can't help it.

17:02.950 --> 17:08.019
Are you and mom
ever gonna live together again?

17:10.492 --> 17:12.561
I don't know.

17:12.564 --> 17:14.058
I want to.

17:14.060 --> 17:16.630
Why don't you?

17:16.632 --> 17:19.661
Because sometimes
dads make mistakes.

17:19.663 --> 17:21.763
And I'm trying
to do everything I can

17:21.766 --> 17:24.497
to fix that mistake
with your mom.

17:28.800 --> 17:29.965
Go to sleep.

18:27.319 --> 18:29.149
We sure this is
the same unsub?

18:29.151 --> 18:32.391
Garcia set up a search parameter
for closed adoptions.

18:32.393 --> 18:35.329
Bill Kinderman
was adopted May 5, 1985.

18:35.331 --> 18:37.666
The M.E. said this victim
slit his own throat.

18:37.668 --> 18:39.499
That's a big change in M.O.

18:39.501 --> 18:42.306
Well, what if that
wasn't the unsub?

18:42.308 --> 18:44.339
What if that was Bill?

18:44.341 --> 18:47.210
So the only other person
in the apartment was his son,

18:47.212 --> 18:49.011
who slept through
the whole thing.

18:49.013 --> 18:51.916
What if the unsub
tried to get him to kill his son,

18:51.918 --> 18:55.388
but his paternal instinct
trumped the effects of the drugs?

18:55.390 --> 18:58.386
Thank God for that,
but we're still at square zero.

18:58.388 --> 19:01.057
This unsub committed
4 murders in 4 states.

19:01.059 --> 19:03.720
How is he connecting
these victims so quickly?

19:03.722 --> 19:05.927
Well, that is what Hotch
is trying to figure out right now

19:05.929 --> 19:08.055
with Kinderman's ex-wife.

19:08.057 --> 19:10.959
No. I mean, yes,
Bill knew he was adopted,

19:10.961 --> 19:14.063
but it was closed.

19:14.065 --> 19:16.233
He didn't know anything
about his past.

19:16.235 --> 19:19.211
Neither did his parents.

19:19.213 --> 19:20.907
Two other victims
drew these.

19:20.909 --> 19:23.874
They were both adopted,
possibly from the same house.

19:23.876 --> 19:25.711
Did he ever talk about
anything like this?

19:25.713 --> 19:28.677
No. I mean, he made up
all sorts of other stories,

19:28.679 --> 19:30.477
but nothing about that.

19:30.479 --> 19:32.244
What do you mean?

19:34.453 --> 19:39.155
He cheated on me, repeatedly.

19:39.157 --> 19:41.261
So I forced him into therapy,

19:41.263 --> 19:44.927
if he wanted
to make the marriage work.

19:44.929 --> 19:46.598
That's when
he started to come home

19:46.600 --> 19:49.935
with all these, well, stories.

19:49.937 --> 19:54.374
Uh, like how he was seduced
by a high school teacher,

19:54.376 --> 19:56.878
but he couldn't remember
which one.

19:56.880 --> 20:01.242
Or he was molested
by a catholic priest at age 12.

20:01.244 --> 20:04.207
I said, Bill, was this before
or after your bar mitzvah?

20:04.209 --> 20:06.341
So they were all
recovered memories?

20:06.343 --> 20:08.244
Yeah.

20:08.246 --> 20:11.107
And even though I proved to him
that they weren't real,

20:11.109 --> 20:15.381
he kept insisting
that they were.

20:15.383 --> 20:17.421
Is this important?

20:18.958 --> 20:21.291
All right, let's assume
all the victims share

20:21.293 --> 20:23.624
Bill Kinderman's propensity
for recovered memories.

20:23.626 --> 20:25.053
What does that mean
for the unsub?

20:25.055 --> 20:27.252
It means his drugs would have
more of an effect on them.

20:27.254 --> 20:29.091
Why them more than
a normal person?

20:29.093 --> 20:31.722
Because when something's remembered
for the first time on a therapist's couch,

20:31.724 --> 20:35.193
it's often a fantasy the patient
is talking themselves into believing.

20:35.195 --> 20:36.961
Popular thinking
is that recovered memories

20:36.963 --> 20:38.761
are actually just
a form of self-hypnosis.

20:38.763 --> 20:41.298
That's why the patients
are so convinced the delusion is real.

20:41.300 --> 20:43.034
So if these victims
are already talking

20:43.036 --> 20:44.506
themselves into
believing fiction,

20:44.508 --> 20:46.407
they would be more
suggestible when they're dosed.

20:46.408 --> 20:48.483
We profiled these victims
had a pre-existing condition.

20:48.484 --> 20:49.868
I think this is it.

20:49.869 --> 20:51.434
How would the unsub
know that?

20:51.436 --> 20:54.033
Because he was there the last time
they made up a story, in 1985.

20:54.035 --> 20:55.368
So they were only
3-4 years old.

20:55.370 --> 20:58.240
Kids that age can't
distinguish fantasy from reality.

20:58.242 --> 21:00.040
Exactly. And their age
plus the time period

21:00.042 --> 21:03.144
puts us right at the height
of the satanic ritual abuse allegations.

21:03.146 --> 21:05.249
Oh, crap.

21:05.251 --> 21:07.153
This is a completely
different set of circumstances.

21:07.155 --> 21:09.083
Was it? Throughout the 1980s,
pre-school-age kids

21:09.085 --> 21:10.858
made accusations
against their teachers.

21:10.860 --> 21:13.555
McMartin, Fells Acres,
Kern County.

21:13.557 --> 21:15.062
270 cases by 1988.

21:15.064 --> 21:17.600
Numerous innocent teachers
had their careers and lives ruined,

21:17.602 --> 21:19.906
and all the cases
were ultimately debunked.

21:19.908 --> 21:22.741
By the BAU and the Lanning
Report, thank you very much.

21:22.743 --> 21:24.276
Except that was
a mass hysteria

21:24.278 --> 21:25.946
involving teachers
and kids,

21:25.948 --> 21:27.649
and these victims
were adopted.

21:27.651 --> 21:30.079
Well, that's the deviation
that made us miss the profile until now.

21:30.081 --> 21:32.582
30 years ago these victims
could have made similar accusations

21:32.584 --> 21:35.612
in a foster home, all saying
the same thing, that they saw this.

21:35.614 --> 21:37.379
3-year-old Larry Merrin
would have said

21:37.381 --> 21:39.252
the monster dragged him
down the stairs.

21:39.254 --> 21:42.125
And 4-year-old Daniel Karras
one-upped it by adding a sexual detail.

21:42.127 --> 21:43.293
That's how kids
tell stories,

21:43.295 --> 21:44.789
especially when
they're reinforced

21:44.791 --> 21:46.491
by well-meaning parents,
therapists, and cops.

21:46.493 --> 21:48.324
And in doing so,
they ruin the unsub's life,

21:48.326 --> 21:49.732
and now he's taking revenge.

21:49.734 --> 21:52.867
Ok, so if this is the why,
how do we find him?

21:52.869 --> 21:53.643
We talk to Christine McNeil.

21:53.667 --> 21:55.548
Maybe she can tell us
where the foster home was.

21:56.068 --> 21:58.432
Flag on the play there.
She's not talking to anyone.

21:58.434 --> 22:00.365
Maybe she will.

22:03.974 --> 22:05.804
So what's your plan?

22:05.806 --> 22:08.739
I want to see if the unsub's signature
has any effect on her.

22:08.741 --> 22:10.371
We don't know
his signature.

22:10.373 --> 22:11.955
Oh, we do. Scopolamine
and sevoflurane

22:11.980 --> 22:13.975
are both odorless and tasteless,

22:13.976 --> 22:16.404
but he introduces
the smell of sage to the drugs.

22:16.406 --> 22:19.738
Clever. But why her
and not the others?

22:19.740 --> 22:22.777
The act of recounting
a false memory hardens it into fact.

22:22.779 --> 22:25.448
Larry Merrin and Daniel Karras
have both told us their stories.

22:25.450 --> 22:26.709
Christine hasn't.

22:26.711 --> 22:29.548
You're thinking you can
interrupt the process.

22:29.550 --> 22:30.612
Maybe.

22:30.614 --> 22:31.748
And if you're wrong,

22:31.750 --> 22:34.250
you can return that stuff
to Garcia.

23:12.822 --> 23:14.625
Christine.

23:16.322 --> 23:17.759
Can you hear me?

23:17.761 --> 23:19.495
Yes.

23:20.624 --> 23:23.757
I'm hungry.

23:23.759 --> 23:26.828
Is it snack time?

23:26.830 --> 23:28.867
Yes, of course.
We can get you something to eat.

23:28.869 --> 23:30.730
What would you like?

23:30.732 --> 23:34.032
I want
a Snoopy sno cone.

23:34.034 --> 23:36.629
Grape flavor.

23:39.101 --> 23:41.802
How old are you, Christine?

23:43.267 --> 23:45.072
4.

23:45.874 --> 23:49.007
And where do you live?
Where's home?

23:52.041 --> 23:54.005
Home is scary.

23:56.582 --> 23:58.947
Christine, you're safe here.

23:58.949 --> 24:01.315
Nothing's going to happen
to you.

24:01.317 --> 24:03.883
That's not true.

24:03.885 --> 24:05.355
That's not true.

24:07.854 --> 24:10.388
He's coming.

24:10.390 --> 24:12.356
He's--he's coming.

24:12.358 --> 24:13.324
Who's coming?

24:13.326 --> 24:16.164
He's on the other side
of the door.

24:16.166 --> 24:20.563
He's coming! He's coming!
He's coming! He's coming!

24:20.565 --> 24:21.835
Aah!

24:24.269 --> 24:26.476
Right? What...

24:26.478 --> 24:29.814
No, no. No, no, no, no, no.

24:32.752 --> 24:33.750
What the hell?

24:33.752 --> 24:36.789
Unplug everything!

24:36.791 --> 24:39.021
He's coming!
He's coming!

24:39.023 --> 24:40.085
Christine, stop!

24:40.087 --> 24:42.262
Aah!

24:42.264 --> 24:43.759
He's coming! He's coming!

24:49.141 --> 24:50.204
He's coming!
He's coming!

24:50.206 --> 24:53.013
Shh, shh, shh.
Christine, where's home?

24:53.015 --> 24:55.045
I can't. I can't.
He's coming. He's coming.

24:55.047 --> 24:56.748
Who is coming?
Who is coming?

24:56.750 --> 24:58.043
Mr. Scratch.

25:01.219 --> 25:03.215
He's already here.

25:09.835 --> 25:11.465
This is cozy.

25:11.467 --> 25:13.569
Do we have any idea
what's going on yet?

25:13.571 --> 25:15.209
Garcia's trying
to get some answers.

25:15.211 --> 25:17.273
Power's out in the whole building.
Backup generator, too.

25:17.275 --> 25:18.608
This guy's got
some mojo.

25:18.610 --> 25:21.006
He knocked us out
right when we got our best lead.

25:21.008 --> 25:23.572
We could cross-reference the name
Mr. Scratch against old statements.

25:23.574 --> 25:25.044
We'd have to go
to the paper files.

25:25.046 --> 25:27.043
We don't have time.
This unsub's probably already found

25:27.045 --> 25:29.281
every kid that made
an accusation from back then.

25:29.283 --> 25:31.713
If we don't get back online soon or get
a lucky break in this case,

25:31.715 --> 25:33.951
we're gonna be looking at more
drugged victims and dead bodies.

25:33.953 --> 25:38.415
Ahem. Getting online is gonna be a lot
harder than you think.

25:39.657 --> 25:41.253
Whoever engineered this,

25:41.255 --> 25:44.985
he did a complete
and total network

25:44.987 --> 25:46.455
and infrastructure
shutdown.

25:46.457 --> 25:49.421
But I thought we had firewalls
to protect from this kind of breach.

25:49.423 --> 25:51.757
We totally do. And
that's what scares me.

25:51.759 --> 25:53.390
Ok? Look, look.

25:53.392 --> 25:56.557
I managed to capture
some of his hacking code

25:56.559 --> 25:58.198
on one of the hard drives
before he could fry it.

25:58.200 --> 26:00.263
I printed this out
at the copy shop.

26:00.265 --> 26:02.732
This is what I can tell you.
It's the only thing, but it's good news.

26:02.734 --> 26:04.204
He wasn't hacking us.

26:04.206 --> 26:07.098
He was looking for something in
the Witness Protection files,

26:07.100 --> 26:08.769
'cause that's what
he raided first.

26:08.771 --> 26:10.568
Do we know who
in Witness Protection?

26:10.570 --> 26:12.439
Well, that's the $64,000
question, isn't it?

26:12.441 --> 26:14.839
And that I will pay you
$64,000 if you can answer it.

26:14.841 --> 26:17.510
His encryption algorithms
are beyond the beyond the beyond.

26:17.512 --> 26:20.342
We're not gonna find him
through his computer expertise.

26:20.344 --> 26:22.045
Certainly not now.
We need to figure out

26:22.047 --> 26:24.844
why he'd take the risk
to hack us.

26:24.846 --> 26:27.222
It's like JJ said. He's looking
for every kid who made an accusation.

26:27.224 --> 26:28.951
One of them
is in Witness Protection.

26:28.953 --> 26:32.026
And he saved them for last
because if he kills that target first,

26:32.028 --> 26:33.460
we'd be on him immediately.

26:33.462 --> 26:34.469
Huh.

26:34.471 --> 26:36.335
What? You see something?

26:36.337 --> 26:38.336
Encryption's a highly
specialized skill set,

26:38.338 --> 26:40.073
but it's fundamentally
a mathematical process,

26:40.075 --> 26:41.576
which means
it's a human process,

26:41.578 --> 26:43.576
but sometimes your technique
can reveal where you learned it.

26:43.578 --> 26:46.142
I think I know where
he learned how to do this.

26:46.144 --> 26:47.350
Where?

26:47.352 --> 26:48.517
Harvard.
Which oddly enough

26:48.519 --> 26:50.045
isn't known for its
advanced math program,

26:50.047 --> 26:52.420
but it is known for
one particular class.

26:52.422 --> 26:54.587
When you're good at math,
you're good enough to get into Harvard,

26:54.589 --> 26:56.153
you take a math class
called Math 15.

26:56.155 --> 26:58.319
When you're better
than that, you take Math 25,

26:58.321 --> 27:02.590
but when you're the best,
the absolute best, you take Math 55--

27:02.592 --> 27:04.686
honors advanced calculus
and linear algebra.

27:04.688 --> 27:07.189
Graduates are immediately
employed by the U.S. government

27:07.191 --> 27:09.860
because they're too dangerous
to work anywhere else.

27:09.862 --> 27:12.132
More specifically,
they're employed at the NSA.

27:12.134 --> 27:14.668
Oh, sir, that would
make a lot of sense.

27:17.531 --> 27:19.936
This is Agent Hotchner
for Mr. Axelrod.

27:19.938 --> 27:23.273
No, I won't hold. Tell him he has
20 minutes to meet me.

27:35.724 --> 27:37.593
It sucks for you
right now, huh?

27:37.595 --> 27:39.466
Can you help us?

27:39.468 --> 27:41.236
I can tell you that nobody
who ever worked at Fort Meade

27:41.238 --> 27:43.005
is responsible
for the hack.

27:43.007 --> 27:44.162
Well, of course not.

27:44.186 --> 27:46.515
He'd be too psychologically
unstable for you to hire him.

27:46.668 --> 27:49.038
But he was good with computers,
so you watched him.

27:49.040 --> 27:50.331
Stop. Stop talking.

27:50.333 --> 27:52.033
You monitored him as he broke
into adoption records...

27:52.035 --> 27:53.334
I can't be having
this conversation.

27:53.336 --> 27:54.501
And decided
who he wanted to hurt.

27:54.503 --> 27:55.501
I took an oath.
And you kept tabs on him

27:55.503 --> 27:56.965
as he stalked
these men and women

27:56.967 --> 27:58.164
just like you did, I took an oath.
Through their computers.

27:58.166 --> 27:59.532
And then he learned
what he needed to learn

27:59.534 --> 28:00.667
to turn them into killers.

28:00.669 --> 28:02.201
My oath is to protect
the laws of this country

28:02.203 --> 28:03.768
and not to spy
on U.S. citizens.

28:03.770 --> 28:05.166
I cannot help you.

28:05.168 --> 28:06.364
Don't tell me that.

28:06.366 --> 28:09.200
You already know who it is.

28:11.999 --> 28:15.497
If I were to cooperate
with your investigation

28:15.499 --> 28:18.400
electronically or otherwise,
I could be fired.

28:18.402 --> 28:21.000
You understand?
Fired.

28:21.002 --> 28:24.303
So I'm sorry. You'll
have to find another way.

28:28.743 --> 28:31.842
Tell Penelope I said hi.

28:31.844 --> 28:34.341
Peter Lewis. Born and raised
in Jacksonville, Florida.

28:34.343 --> 28:36.571
To call him a math genius
would be an understatement.

28:36.573 --> 28:38.273
Where was he
in the foster system?

28:38.275 --> 28:40.545
He was--gahh!

28:40.547 --> 28:42.912
This Wi-Fi hot spot
is the worst.

28:42.914 --> 28:45.080
He was not in
the foster care system.

28:45.082 --> 28:48.048
He had two very biological
parents and they ran the foster home

28:48.050 --> 28:49.383
until it--

28:49.385 --> 28:51.719
Oh, dear.

28:51.721 --> 28:53.984
Looks like we found
Mr. Scratch.

28:53.986 --> 28:55.759
So one of the boys
in the house

28:55.761 --> 28:57.790
said Peter's dad would
dress up as the devil

28:57.792 --> 28:59.356
and the other kids
would follow suit.

28:59.358 --> 29:01.556
This has to be where
all the victims stayed

29:01.558 --> 29:04.028
before they were adopted
and their names were changed.

29:04.030 --> 29:05.828
Did Lewis' father
serve any time?

29:05.830 --> 29:07.795
Uh, the case was pending,

29:07.797 --> 29:10.931
and then he was killed
in jail for being a pedophile.

29:10.933 --> 29:13.234
Peter's residency
is still listed as Florida.

29:13.236 --> 29:15.266
Then he broke into
the FBI files to find out

29:15.268 --> 29:16.601
who went into
Witness Protection.

29:16.603 --> 29:18.369
Did any of the kids from the home
go into WITSEC?

29:18.371 --> 29:20.009
That would be a...

29:20.011 --> 29:21.745
No. No, none of them.

29:21.747 --> 29:23.039
Who the hell
is he still hunting.

29:23.041 --> 29:25.574
Garcia, who ran
the investigation in Florida?

29:25.576 --> 29:27.580
Uh, hold on.

29:27.582 --> 29:30.179
Dr. Susannah Regan,

29:30.181 --> 29:32.915
who was responsible for many
of the investigations during the day.

29:32.917 --> 29:35.512
She was a member of the
“Believe the Children” movement,

29:35.514 --> 29:38.680
which encouraged cops to believe
anything the kid said about the SRA,

29:38.682 --> 29:40.887
and if the kiddos didn't
have anything to say,

29:40.889 --> 29:43.255
she'd tell the cops
to twist their arms until they did.

29:43.257 --> 29:44.456
And then her book
was published.

29:44.458 --> 29:46.592
And we came out with
the Lanning Report

29:46.594 --> 29:47.896
and debunked her.

29:47.898 --> 29:49.192
Uh-huh. Her career flopped

29:49.194 --> 29:50.695
and she received
numerous death threats

29:50.697 --> 29:52.230
and she went into
Witness Protection.

29:52.232 --> 29:53.662
She's such
a high-profile target,

29:53.664 --> 29:55.599
Peter had to wait
before he could kill her.

29:55.601 --> 29:57.165
If he's bold enough
to hit Quantico,

29:57.167 --> 29:58.637
he knows
it's a one-way ticket.

29:58.639 --> 30:01.272
This is a suicide mission
if he locates her before we do.

30:01.274 --> 30:03.805
Which would be on a very nice estate
in Columbia, Maryland.

30:03.807 --> 30:06.242
I'm closest.
Send me the address.

30:06.244 --> 30:07.641
Sent.

30:28.523 --> 30:30.383
Dr. Regan.

30:30.385 --> 30:33.388
It's open. Come in.

30:33.390 --> 30:34.523
Are you all right?

30:34.525 --> 30:35.851
Agent Hotchner?

30:35.853 --> 30:38.656
I got Agent Rossi's
message.

30:38.658 --> 30:41.191
Doctor, you're in danger.
You need to leave the house.

30:41.193 --> 30:45.159
I understand.
I'm in the study.

30:45.161 --> 30:47.799
I'm so glad you're here.

30:47.801 --> 30:50.230
You need to see this.

30:51.168 --> 30:53.630
He wants you
to see this.

30:53.632 --> 30:55.502
No!

31:02.149 --> 31:03.316
Aah!

31:05.351 --> 31:08.485
Uhh! Aah...

31:21.073 --> 31:22.838
Aah...

32:00.230 --> 32:03.499
You can't move.

32:03.501 --> 32:08.331
Because I say
you can't move.

32:08.333 --> 32:10.803
Do you see how this works?

32:12.373 --> 32:16.442
You do what I say.

32:16.444 --> 32:18.644
Peter...

32:18.646 --> 32:21.780
I didn't say
you could talk.

32:23.182 --> 32:24.988
Don't cry for her.

32:24.990 --> 32:27.892
She was stupid.

32:27.894 --> 32:30.661
And wrong.

32:30.663 --> 32:36.197
She used to burn sage
during the sessions.

32:36.199 --> 32:42.138
She said that made it safe
to talk about Mr. Scratch.

32:42.140 --> 32:47.108
What do you see
when you look at me?

32:49.880 --> 32:53.719
Do you see Mr. Scratch?

32:53.721 --> 32:55.983
You can talk now.
I want to know what--

32:55.985 --> 32:57.518
I want to know
what you're feeling.

33:00.192 --> 33:02.558
That's my team.

33:02.560 --> 33:05.125
They know I'm here.

33:05.127 --> 33:08.133
They're gonna come looking
for me, and if you harm me--

33:08.135 --> 33:09.565
What are you talking about?

33:09.567 --> 33:11.931
Your phone isn't ringing.

33:11.933 --> 33:14.097
It was ringing.

33:14.099 --> 33:16.367
No, it wasn't.

33:16.369 --> 33:19.735
Very interesting.

33:22.072 --> 33:25.506
You gave yourself away
just now.

33:25.508 --> 33:26.706
I did?

33:26.708 --> 33:28.536
You slipped up.

33:28.538 --> 33:31.205
How do you figure?

33:31.207 --> 33:33.573
You have no idea, do you?

33:41.651 --> 33:45.825
You said that she...

33:45.827 --> 33:48.327
She would...

33:48.329 --> 33:51.292
burn sage.

33:52.158 --> 33:55.395
But how would you know that?

33:55.397 --> 34:00.101
Unless she questioned you, too.

34:00.103 --> 34:03.102
I know, Peter.

34:04.638 --> 34:07.676
I know how
those interviews worked,

34:07.678 --> 34:12.476
how coercive they were...

34:12.478 --> 34:18.081
with children who were
innocent and helpless.

34:18.083 --> 34:19.313
Shut up.

34:19.315 --> 34:24.520
She questioned you
about your father.

34:24.522 --> 34:26.824
And she wouldn't stop

34:26.826 --> 34:31.462
until she got
the answers she wanted.

34:34.097 --> 34:37.429
So you gave them to her.

34:39.672 --> 34:42.333
Shut up.

34:48.777 --> 34:51.184
Oh, that was good.

34:51.186 --> 34:53.079
Oh, that was so good.

34:53.081 --> 34:55.487
That was so impressive.

34:56.857 --> 34:59.957
The way you
got into my head.

34:59.959 --> 35:04.886
It makes me want to know
how I get into yours.

35:08.157 --> 35:10.082
You were right.

35:10.084 --> 35:13.488
They did coming
calling for you.

35:14.490 --> 35:16.929
They'll kill you.

35:16.931 --> 35:21.099
Are you sure about that?

35:59.655 --> 36:02.389
Spence!

36:02.391 --> 36:05.230
Stop fire! Spence is down!

36:05.232 --> 36:07.063
Oh, my God.

36:07.065 --> 36:08.736
Oh, no.

36:36.294 --> 36:38.893
Rossi, where are you hit?

36:38.895 --> 36:41.396
Hotch! Sound off, damn it!

36:41.398 --> 36:42.965
Here.

36:42.967 --> 36:45.005
Go. Go.

36:49.836 --> 36:51.074
Where?!

36:51.076 --> 36:52.339
Here.

36:52.341 --> 36:55.044
In the study.

37:00.715 --> 37:02.313
Where?

37:02.315 --> 37:04.153
Where is he?

37:04.155 --> 37:06.018
I shot him. He's down.

37:06.020 --> 37:07.826
Morgan!

37:07.828 --> 37:08.826
Uhh!

37:14.301 --> 37:16.899
Now I know
what scares you.

37:16.901 --> 37:17.930
No!

37:17.932 --> 37:20.099
No!

37:23.310 --> 37:25.815
Son of a bitch.

37:25.817 --> 37:28.218
Son of a bitch...

37:34.829 --> 37:36.594
It's ok.

37:36.596 --> 37:39.464
You can move now.

37:50.041 --> 37:51.703
Here.

37:51.705 --> 37:53.871
I have something for you.

37:59.742 --> 38:03.280
I'm about to come
through that front door.

38:03.282 --> 38:04.910
Kill me

38:04.912 --> 38:07.612
before I kill you.

38:09.779 --> 38:11.543
Rossi, Reid, take the front.

38:11.545 --> 38:13.206
JJ and I will take the back.

38:13.208 --> 38:16.475
Watch your front sight.
One of ours is in there.

38:16.477 --> 38:18.611
My gun.

38:18.613 --> 38:21.213
I need my gun.

38:25.391 --> 38:27.725
Look. Here I come.

38:27.727 --> 38:29.629
Kill me.

38:52.781 --> 38:55.083
Hotch!

38:56.084 --> 38:57.821
We need a medic in here!

38:57.823 --> 39:00.959
Rossi, take it.

39:00.961 --> 39:04.401
They made me see things.

39:04.403 --> 39:06.098
They made me see things.

39:06.100 --> 39:07.435
Ok.

39:07.437 --> 39:09.036
He's gone.

39:20.617 --> 39:22.551
We got him.

39:41.309 --> 39:42.539
I win.

39:42.541 --> 39:44.707
I don't think so.

39:44.709 --> 39:49.074
You have no idea
what I did to him.

39:49.076 --> 39:50.649
I win.

39:57.124 --> 39:59.321
He surrendered.

39:59.323 --> 40:00.953
Ambulance is on its way.

40:00.955 --> 40:02.225
He surrendered?
That doesn't make sense.

40:02.227 --> 40:03.321
We need to get you
looked at.

40:03.323 --> 40:04.455
I'm fine.

40:04.457 --> 40:08.388
Hey, this is
not a suggestion.

40:41.269 --> 40:43.801
I'm fine. Thank you.

40:47.605 --> 40:50.106
You have to talk
about it.

40:50.108 --> 40:51.105
Not tonight.

40:51.107 --> 40:52.472
Yes, tonight,

40:52.474 --> 40:53.745
while it's still fresh.

40:53.747 --> 40:55.114
I can't.

40:55.116 --> 40:57.285
It doesn't...

40:57.287 --> 40:59.789
Parts of it don't
make sense to me.

40:59.791 --> 41:01.285
They don't have to.

41:01.287 --> 41:03.325
Tell me
what it smelled like.

41:03.327 --> 41:04.860
Tell me how you felt.

41:04.862 --> 41:09.062
Start at the beginning,
start at the end, I don't care. But start.

41:09.064 --> 41:13.738
Now, what do you remember?

41:16.245 --> 41:18.275
Aaron.
