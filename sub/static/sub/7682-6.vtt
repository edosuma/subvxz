00:47.738 --> 00:49.949
I'd finished a mission in Zurich

00:49.949 --> 00:53.744
and the Phoenix Foundation
gave me a bonus.

00:53.744 --> 00:56.997
Time off and a first-class flight
anywhere I wanted to go.

00:56.997 --> 01:02.962
So I took them up on it.
Signed up for a hot air balloon rally.

01:03.629 --> 01:05.756
Slow and easy, over the Alps.

01:05.756 --> 01:08.342
No schedule, no time tables.

01:08.384 --> 01:10.219
Just watching the birds go by.

01:10.219 --> 01:12.888
Enjoying the scenery,
smelling the fresh air

01:12.888 --> 01:17.392
and reminding myself
why eagles don't get ulcers.

01:17.392 --> 01:21.104
I did hope we had enough fuel
to keep our altitude over the peaks

01:21.104 --> 01:23.732
and clear the snow field.

01:26.777 --> 01:30.030
We did. And as soon as
we got away from the others,

01:30.030 --> 01:32.658
everything kinda worked out.

01:32.783 --> 01:36.161
Besides, I'd brought along an expert.

01:36.995 --> 01:39.831
MacGyver, I can't make it pop.

01:41.166 --> 01:45.128
Well, as they say,
it's all in the wrist.

01:49.216 --> 01:51.843
Hold it.

02:26.711 --> 02:29.297
A bogey.

02:34.677 --> 02:37.972
Not today, pal.
Let's part company.

02:46.356 --> 02:49.067
Whoever you are, you're good.

02:50.902 --> 02:55.657
Back up base, this is GX-1,
breaking radio silence.

02:57.450 --> 02:58.785
I've been spotted.

02:58.785 --> 03:03.331
I've got a MiG-25 Foxbat interceptor
on my tail.

03:06.042 --> 03:10.213
I can't shake the bogey.
He's lining me up.

03:16.177 --> 03:20.056
Climb to 90,000 feet.
MiG tops out at 75,000.

03:20.056 --> 03:23.059
Roger, base.
Attempting altitude.

03:27.480 --> 03:30.566
- I'm hit! I'm hit!
- Climb, GX- 1.

03:30.566 --> 03:32.735
Climbing.

03:32.735 --> 03:36.072
078, longitude, 50 degrees, 22 north.

03:36.405 --> 03:39.200
Latitude 1 2 degrees, 55 east.

03:40.576 --> 03:46.415
Altitude, 78,000.
Eighty... 84,000 feet.

03:46.874 --> 03:50.044
And that's it.
That's all she's got.

03:50.044 --> 03:54.465
All right.
Bogey hit his ceiling. I've lost him.

03:54.465 --> 03:58.052
Hold it!
Flaring number-one engine.

03:59.261 --> 04:00.888
Losing power.

04:00.888 --> 04:03.265
- Engine number one out!
- Sit in, GX-1.

04:03.265 --> 04:05.893
Come on, we'll pick you up.

04:06.644 --> 04:08.854
I can't hold her steady!

04:08.854 --> 04:12.399
Oh, God!
Trouble on number-two engine.

04:15.152 --> 04:16.987
number-two engine out!

04:16.987 --> 04:20.115
Attempting re-ignition!
Negative, negative, no go.

04:20.115 --> 04:23.994
Stand by. Setting destruct... now!

04:26.330 --> 04:29.750
Tell my wife...
Tell her I love her.

04:41.219 --> 04:45.599
One thing you got to know
when you're ballooning is how to land.

04:45.599 --> 04:51.396
Simply put, you just cut the heat
and let gravity do the rest.

04:51.396 --> 04:53.607
MacGyver!

04:53.607 --> 04:55.984
What a landing.
Hey, Pete!

04:55.984 --> 04:59.070
What on earth are you doing here?

05:00.113 --> 05:02.324
Listen, we have a problem.

05:02.324 --> 05:04.493
Would you excuse us a minute, please?

05:04.493 --> 05:06.369
Come here.

05:06.369 --> 05:09.331
- What's up?
- We've lost a plane.

05:09.331 --> 05:11.374
Somewhere here over the Alps.

05:11.374 --> 05:14.294
Must be an important plane
for you to come this far.

05:14.294 --> 05:16.880
Well, it is. The GX-1.

05:17.672 --> 05:20.884
Oh, you mean the plane
that's not supposed to exist yet?

05:20.884 --> 05:23.094
Yeah, well, this is a modified GX-1.

05:23.094 --> 05:28.183
It is the most secret,
most experimental craft ever developed.

05:28.183 --> 05:31.770
But it won't be a secret very long
if you can't find the wreckage.

05:31.770 --> 05:33.021
Wait a minute, Pete.

05:33.021 --> 05:36.357
Search for missing aircraft.
Isn't that your department?

05:36.357 --> 05:38.276
Takes your kind of manpower.

05:38.276 --> 05:41.237
You need radar, infrared,
air search, all that...

05:41.237 --> 05:44.908
That's just the point.
This is a prototype stealth craft

05:44.908 --> 05:47.702
with an experimental
cooling system.

05:47.702 --> 05:51.289
Its whole purpose is
to defeat radar and infrared.

05:51.289 --> 05:53.791
The Air Force
has done everything they can.

05:53.791 --> 05:57.295
They have gone as far as they can go.

05:58.254 --> 06:00.840
What do you mean?

06:00.882 --> 06:05.303
I mean they can't cross
the East German border.

06:05.428 --> 06:08.181
Pentagon thinks the plane
is on the other side.

06:08.181 --> 06:10.516
And they can't go in themselves.

06:10.516 --> 06:13.060
So it's us.

06:13.060 --> 06:15.229
Any more good news, Pete?

06:15.229 --> 06:18.483
Yeah, I have a few things
I can give you back at the hotel.

06:18.483 --> 06:24.113
Fine. I'll meet you there.
Just let me say goodbye to Heidi.

06:24.488 --> 06:27.116
What's she doing here?

06:30.578 --> 06:34.415
Nikki, nothing personal, but
I'm going into the mountains alone.

06:34.415 --> 06:39.170
- Pete, you should have consulted me.
- I tried to call you, more than once.

06:39.170 --> 06:41.714
Yeah, well, I've been out of touch.

06:41.714 --> 06:44.759
- Slaving away, as I can see.
- I said nothing personal,

06:44.759 --> 06:47.344
but those mountains are rugged.
I don't...

06:47.344 --> 06:49.764
You don't wanna drag
a woman around.

06:49.764 --> 06:53.017
- I wouldn't have put it like that.
- That's what you meant.

06:53.017 --> 06:55.144
You're a closet sexist.

06:55.144 --> 06:56.437
- What?!
- MacGyver.

06:56.437 --> 06:58.939
Why don't we admit
we do things differently?

06:58.939 --> 07:00.191
Hold it.

07:00.191 --> 07:02.151
Soon as I finish baby-sitting...

07:02.151 --> 07:03.944
I knew this wouldn't work.

07:03.944 --> 07:06.822
-...I'm going to the Aspenhaus...
- Baby-sitting?

07:06.822 --> 07:11.493
- I do not need to be baby-sat.
-...courtesy of the Phoenix Foundation.

07:11.493 --> 07:14.830
Would you hold it a minute?
Let me get a word in edgewise here.

07:14.830 --> 07:18.334
Now you are going to go
across that East German border together,

07:18.334 --> 07:22.755
as a married couple, because that's how
I think you will get across undetected.

07:22.755 --> 07:25.549
Once you are across,
once you're at the resort,

07:25.549 --> 07:29.011
you can separate.
You can each go your own way.

07:29.011 --> 07:32.222
Okay?
Everybody happy now?

07:34.266 --> 07:36.643
Good.

07:36.643 --> 07:38.478
Okay, let's go back to the hotel.

07:38.478 --> 07:40.814
- There's a lot of prep work to do.
- Fine.

07:40.814 --> 07:44.109
I'll meet you there,
as soon as I get Heidi a ride home.

07:44.109 --> 07:47.487
- Heidi? It would be.
- Oh, stop it.

07:56.121 --> 07:58.415
I can't hold her steady!

07:58.415 --> 08:00.125
Oh, God!

08:00.125 --> 08:02.753
Trouble in number-two engine!

08:03.128 --> 08:06.548
Attempting re-ignition!
Negative, negative, no go.

08:06.548 --> 08:08.175
Can't fire.

08:08.175 --> 08:10.719
Setting destruct... now.

08:10.719 --> 08:13.972
Tell my wife...
Tell her I love her.

08:13.972 --> 08:17.183
- Any word on the pilot?
- No. Not since he ejected.

08:17.183 --> 08:19.978
In fact, the pilot is presumed dead.

08:19.978 --> 08:22.814
But... from his last known position,

08:22.814 --> 08:26.401
the speed of the aircraft,
and the direction he was flying in,

08:26.401 --> 08:29.904
we've calculated that the wreckage
should be somewhere here.

08:29.904 --> 08:31.114
In this area.

08:31.114 --> 08:33.198
In the mountains,
over the border.

08:33.198 --> 08:34.784
What do we expect to find?

08:34.784 --> 08:38.328
The skin of the aircraft
was coated with a deflection shield.

08:38.328 --> 08:42.667
But the real goody is this new
cooling system on the engine exhaust.

08:42.667 --> 08:46.588
It makes the plane
virtually undetectable with infrared.

08:46.588 --> 08:48.798
That's what the Russians are after.

08:48.798 --> 08:50.300
So you're in a race.

08:50.300 --> 08:53.011
We got a head start
with those last coordinates.

08:53.011 --> 08:56.014
That's true, but
the Russians have something...

08:56.014 --> 09:00.143
Someone, going for them too.
I'll be honest, I scoffed myself,

09:00.143 --> 09:03.563
but Intelligence
is taking this seriously.

09:03.563 --> 09:06.149
It's a man named Starkoss.
He's a psychic.

09:06.149 --> 09:08.609
- A psychic?
- That's right.

09:08.609 --> 09:11.237
Watch this.

09:18.327 --> 09:19.954
This film was smuggled out

09:19.954 --> 09:23.916
of the Petroskia Institute
for Paranormal Studies in Moscow.

09:23.916 --> 09:28.045
The Russians are very deeply into
parapsychology, psychic phenomena,

09:28.045 --> 09:29.672
mind control.

09:29.672 --> 09:33.885
They find these psychics, and
they train them for intelligence work.

09:33.885 --> 09:37.555
Now this man, Starkoss,
is their number-one performer.

09:37.555 --> 09:42.768
He's a celebrity, a star.
He lives like a king, even in Russia.

09:42.768 --> 09:47.273
And our experts say
that he could be the real thing.

09:47.273 --> 09:50.109
Well, that's great by me.

09:50.276 --> 09:54.321
I've got the pilot's last coordinates,
his altitude, his air speed,

09:54.321 --> 09:58.617
a satellite map. And they've got
some guy doing parlour tricks.

09:58.617 --> 10:02.705
- I'll take the odds any day.
- I wouldn't.

10:26.478 --> 10:29.106
There is trouble.

10:31.024 --> 10:33.610
The craft...

10:33.944 --> 10:36.530
...it was over our airspace.

10:36.738 --> 10:39.992
We believe it was making
a surveillance flight.

10:39.992 --> 10:42.119
We detected nothing on our radar.

10:42.119 --> 10:46.123
Some malfunction must've
forced it down to lower altitudes.

10:46.123 --> 10:48.458
That is when our aircraft
observed him.

10:48.458 --> 10:52.296
Yes, there is trouble.
I see it.

10:52.462 --> 10:55.048
The pilot is afraid.

10:55.382 --> 10:57.968
All he wants is to go home.

10:58.302 --> 11:00.887
And then he's spotted.

11:03.598 --> 11:06.101
We fired upon him.

11:06.101 --> 11:08.854
The photographs
are from our gun cameras.

11:08.854 --> 11:12.649
We fired on him
when he refused to land.

11:13.692 --> 11:16.736
I'm hit! I'm hit.

11:18.697 --> 11:21.283
There's damage.

11:24.619 --> 11:27.038
I can't make it.

11:27.038 --> 11:30.500
I can't make it.

11:31.251 --> 11:33.712
Call to base.

11:33.712 --> 11:39.634
We lost him, but he went down.
We know that. Where's the plane?

11:43.972 --> 11:46.599
Bring me map.

12:24.095 --> 12:27.265
You will find plane here.

12:38.317 --> 12:40.861
You were real smooth
with that border guard.

12:40.861 --> 12:43.823
How'd you manage to ask him
about his sister's feet?

12:43.823 --> 12:46.617
So my German's not so good.
We got through.

12:46.617 --> 12:48.619
Thank you for all your help.

12:48.619 --> 12:51.330
I suppose your Swiss Miss
could've done better.

12:51.330 --> 12:55.251
Heidi happens to be competent,
intelligent and articulate.

12:55.251 --> 12:58.129
- Not to mention a great body.
- That's not her fault.

12:58.129 --> 13:00.297
You wouldn't hold it against her.

13:00.297 --> 13:03.092
Now who's the sexist, huh?
Who's the sexist?

13:03.092 --> 13:05.594
- Heidi.
- That's right, that's her name.

13:05.594 --> 13:07.972
H-E-I-D-I. What's wrong with it?

13:07.972 --> 13:10.599
- Nothing. Nothing.
- Mr and Mrs Carpenter?

13:10.599 --> 13:12.726
- Yes.
- Welcome to Aspenhaus.

13:12.726 --> 13:16.355
I'm Helmut. I'll be your attendant
while you're with us.

13:16.355 --> 13:19.024
Oh, very nice to meet you, Helmut.

13:19.024 --> 13:22.945
What a lovely name.
Please, call me Nikki.

13:22.945 --> 13:24.780
I'll take these to your room,

13:24.780 --> 13:27.783
then I'll tell you
all about the services we have.

13:27.783 --> 13:29.284
Oh, wonderful.

13:29.284 --> 13:35.249
I'm sure we'll find plenty to keep
us busy while my husband's off hiking.

13:35.249 --> 13:39.628
Just drop the bags
in the bridal suite, Helmut.

13:40.170 --> 13:41.672
Ciao.

13:41.672 --> 13:43.799
See you later, Helmut.

13:43.799 --> 13:46.385
Well, he seemed very polite.

13:48.011 --> 13:51.014
- And articulate.
- Yeah.

13:51.431 --> 13:55.602
- Helmut.
- Have a nice time on the mountain.

14:10.701 --> 14:14.621
- Good morning, Comrade Starkoss.
- Morning.

14:22.671 --> 14:25.549
The helicopter's ready, colonel.

15:08.967 --> 15:11.552
MacGyver!

16:38.806 --> 16:41.392
Hello!

16:45.521 --> 16:48.148
Boy, am I glad to see you.

16:48.816 --> 16:53.445
I could really use a hand.
Actually, I could really use your horse.

16:53.445 --> 16:55.781
Could I borrow him?
Or... or rent him.

16:55.781 --> 17:00.160
I'd be happy to
buy him outright if I had to.

17:06.208 --> 17:11.588
How much deutsche marks
for das horsey?

17:44.037 --> 17:46.247
Soon as your teeth
stop chattering...

17:46.247 --> 17:48.917
- MacGyver!
-...there's an obvious question.

17:48.917 --> 17:50.794
Realize what I've been through?

17:50.794 --> 17:54.631
That rotten horse!
He threw me off halfway up the mountain.

17:54.631 --> 17:57.133
Then I had to walk and walk.

17:57.133 --> 18:01.930
And I fell into this river,
and I cut my feet trying to get out.

18:01.930 --> 18:04.224
I think a mountain lion followed me.

18:04.224 --> 18:06.226
No, that wasn't the question.

18:06.226 --> 18:10.230
Then I saw this glorious campfire,
and I prayed that it would be you.

18:10.230 --> 18:12.232
It could've been Jack the Ripper.

18:12.232 --> 18:14.484
I would've been his
to get to this fire.

18:14.484 --> 18:17.278
I know this comes
as no big surprise to you,

18:17.278 --> 18:20.198
but you are soaked to the bone.

18:20.448 --> 18:23.618
- Here, put those on.
- Thank you.

18:27.914 --> 18:30.541
Could you turn around?

18:46.140 --> 18:48.226
Put both shirts on and tuck them in.

18:48.226 --> 18:52.021
- Leave the top one unbuttoned.
- I saw Starkoss, he's up here.

18:52.021 --> 18:53.856
He left the Aspenhaus by car.

18:53.856 --> 18:56.567
There was something said
about a helicopter.

18:56.567 --> 19:00.363
Yeah, a helicopter.
I saw one fly over this afternoon.

19:00.363 --> 19:05.409
From the direction I'd say it was
headed towards the target zone.

19:05.409 --> 19:08.913
Which means they've got a jump on us.

19:10.289 --> 19:15.211
Listen, that was
important information for me to have.

19:17.296 --> 19:19.882
I owe you one.

19:20.466 --> 19:23.844
It's okay.
You can turn around now.

19:32.728 --> 19:35.564
Pull your top shirt open there.

19:36.023 --> 19:38.651
- Like this?
- Yeah.

19:39.068 --> 19:40.444
What are you doing?

19:40.444 --> 19:43.697
Putting pine needles
between shirts for insulation.

19:43.697 --> 19:48.786
It's not quite Neiman Marcus,
but it'll keep you warm.

19:48.952 --> 19:53.707
Okay, ouch!
I got it. Thank you. I'll do it later.

19:55.334 --> 19:57.336
There's some trail mix there.

19:57.336 --> 20:00.339
Water in the canteen, if you'd like.

20:00.339 --> 20:03.759
No, thanks.
I just want to get warm.

20:04.718 --> 20:09.473
By the way, there are
no mountain lions in East Germany.

20:09.473 --> 20:11.141
Is that it?

20:11.141 --> 20:14.102
Is that all you have with you,
is one sleeping bag?

20:14.102 --> 20:17.647
Yeah. Well, I wasn't expecting company.

20:20.984 --> 20:23.236
There's plenty of room here.

20:23.236 --> 20:26.281
Yeah, right.
Not in a million years.

20:26.281 --> 20:28.867
Suit yourself. Good night.

21:12.202 --> 21:15.830
- Good morning.
- 'Morning.

21:21.794 --> 21:26.257
I have to give you high marks for acting
like a perfect gentleman last night.

21:26.257 --> 21:28.551
That's amazing.

21:28.551 --> 21:33.389
I don't know how I did it,
but I controlled myself.

21:35.266 --> 21:37.393
I guess I deserved that.

21:37.393 --> 21:40.855
- Now what?
- Well, we find the plane.

21:40.855 --> 21:45.193
But it's gonna take
some walking to get there.

21:47.195 --> 21:49.071
You all right?

21:49.071 --> 21:52.158
Just fine.
If you don't count the blisters.

21:52.158 --> 21:55.369
Those homemade boots I made
aren't gonna last long.

21:55.369 --> 21:59.081
You might have been better off
going back to... Helmut.

21:59.081 --> 22:02.460
Excuse me, I had to play
Sir Edmund Hillary to get up here

22:02.460 --> 22:05.463
and warn you about that
Russian search party.

22:05.463 --> 22:08.591
How can I forget?
You keep reminding me.

22:08.591 --> 22:12.011
Wisecrack all you want.
We don't know what we're up against.

22:12.011 --> 22:13.763
Starkoss is something else.

22:13.763 --> 22:19.518
Mr Starkoss is no more clairvoyant
than common sense and logic.

22:28.611 --> 22:31.405
How did they know where to go?

22:31.405 --> 22:35.534
Same way we did.
They calculated the speed of the GX-1

22:35.534 --> 22:39.371
and approximated
where it had to go down.

22:41.624 --> 22:44.001
What is it?

22:44.001 --> 22:46.420
I'm afraid we found the pilot.

22:46.420 --> 22:49.006
Quickly, come with me.

22:49.465 --> 22:51.800
Colonel, have I earned my keep today?

22:51.800 --> 22:55.888
Very impressive.
Or maybe a bit of good fortune.

22:55.888 --> 23:00.225
I'll resist the temptation to celebrate
until we find the plane.

23:00.225 --> 23:03.312
Bring me a piece of his clothing.

23:06.815 --> 23:09.276
Here, sir.

23:09.276 --> 23:12.279
That chopper couldn't land around here.

23:12.279 --> 23:15.824
They must've dropped them in
when they saw the parachute.

23:15.824 --> 23:19.328
At least they haven't found the plane.

23:22.331 --> 23:26.793
Look around.
Look around the ground for anything.

23:38.054 --> 23:40.182
I don't want to die.

23:40.182 --> 23:43.727
I... I don't want...

23:46.479 --> 23:50.942
- Position... location...
- Where is the plane?

24:05.457 --> 24:08.084
There.

24:10.920 --> 24:14.549
- Let's go.
- The pilot. We should bury him.

24:14.549 --> 24:16.843
Should we also hold a service?

24:16.843 --> 24:19.470
Collect your squad. Move out!

24:20.305 --> 24:24.142
Call base. Alert the helicopter.
Have it stand by with equipment.

24:24.142 --> 24:26.769
Just in case.

24:27.979 --> 24:29.939
Lieutenant to Command Outpost.

24:29.939 --> 24:33.067
Have the helicopter ready
with the equipment.

24:33.067 --> 24:38.322
Quickly, quickly! All right,
move, move. Move, move, move!

25:11.397 --> 25:13.607
This must be an abandoned barracks.

25:13.607 --> 25:16.569
There's stuff all over the place.

25:16.569 --> 25:19.113
I found these boots.

25:19.113 --> 25:24.869
I guess the best we can do
is bring these back to his family.

25:35.171 --> 25:37.756
MacGyver...

25:39.300 --> 25:42.261
"Follow me. Starkoss."

25:42.428 --> 25:43.846
He knew we'd come here.

25:43.846 --> 25:46.181
- He saw us.
- Why didn't he come after us?

25:46.181 --> 25:47.599
We're in East Germany.

25:47.599 --> 25:51.478
- They're trying to draw us closer.
- Maybe he didn't tell them.

25:51.478 --> 25:53.647
We should move
and find that plane.

25:53.647 --> 25:56.275
Let's bury the pilot first.

26:00.988 --> 26:04.199
- We're here! Come on!
- Yes, sir.

26:04.241 --> 26:07.494
- Hurry! Come on.
- There it is!

26:07.661 --> 26:10.289
Well done! Well done.

26:22.301 --> 26:24.886
Very dramatic.

26:24.970 --> 26:29.599
You should faint, Starkoss, for surely
this is an overwhelming moment.

26:29.599 --> 26:33.729
You have just insured your
personal supply of caviar forever.

26:33.729 --> 26:37.649
I cannot talk.
I just want to replenish my energies.

26:37.649 --> 26:41.445
- Replenish all you want. Lieutenant.
- Spread out. Patrol the area.

26:41.445 --> 26:44.364
Gather every piece of aircraft
no matter how small.

26:44.364 --> 26:46.992
You two, move. Start here.

26:49.077 --> 26:52.914
Markov to base.
I have located the wreckage.

26:52.914 --> 26:58.253
You have a fix on our location.
Send in the removal team.

27:31.119 --> 27:35.248
- Starkoss! He took them right to it.
- Well, he got here first.

27:35.248 --> 27:38.876
But we can't let them leave
with one piece of that cooling system.

27:38.876 --> 27:41.462
All these soldiers!
What'll we do?

27:41.462 --> 27:46.884
- We have to destroy the plane.
- That's a very good idea.

27:50.054 --> 27:52.557
Had I wanted
to have you taken prisoner,

27:52.557 --> 27:58.062
I could have pointed you out
to Colonel Markov at any time.

27:58.229 --> 28:00.356
Yeah. We got your note.

28:00.356 --> 28:02.650
How did you know
we were following you?

28:02.650 --> 28:06.195
How did I know?
But I brought you to me.

28:06.195 --> 28:08.864
Why would you do that?
What do you want with us?

28:08.864 --> 28:11.576
After you destroy the plane...

28:11.617 --> 28:14.078
...I want to go back
with you to the West.

28:14.078 --> 28:16.706
- You want to defect?
- Yes.

28:16.831 --> 28:19.166
That be feather in your cap, no?

28:19.166 --> 28:21.293
Well, I don't care about that.

28:21.293 --> 28:24.004
But if you want to go,
we'll sure take you.

28:24.004 --> 28:27.049
You will have to wait
until the soldiers have put

28:27.049 --> 28:32.054
the remainder of the plane into a pile,
and then you can use your explosive

28:32.054 --> 28:37.351
you've been carrying in your pack
and destroy the pieces.

28:40.688 --> 28:43.607
It is good of you to come with him.

28:43.607 --> 28:46.569
You will save his life.

28:46.735 --> 28:50.030
Don't worry about your feet.
They will not fail you.

28:50.030 --> 28:51.323
How did you know?

28:51.323 --> 28:57.871
It might be better to wait until night,
but... you're an impatient man.

29:04.211 --> 29:06.422
He knew!
He knew about my feet.

29:06.422 --> 29:08.632
I've got blisters.
I didn't tell him.

29:08.632 --> 29:11.301
You're wearing oversized boots.

29:11.301 --> 29:14.429
- Blisters are a given.
- He knew you carried explosives.

29:14.429 --> 29:18.684
He knew I came here to destroy the
pieces of the plane when I found them.

29:18.684 --> 29:22.187
I'm not gonna truck 'em off
the mountain in my backpack.

29:22.187 --> 29:24.690
Maybe. But he was right
on both occasions.

29:24.690 --> 29:26.066
He found the plane.

29:26.066 --> 29:29.403
If he thinks we'll hang around
long enough for the Russians

29:29.403 --> 29:34.449
to take that stuff,
then he's reading the wrong minds.

29:35.117 --> 29:37.786
Okay, now what are we gonna do?

29:37.786 --> 29:39.204
You're gonna stay put.

29:39.204 --> 29:42.082
I'm gonna give myself
ten minutes to make it back.

29:42.082 --> 29:45.544
I'll use the explosion as a diversion,
grab Starkoss and go.

29:45.544 --> 29:47.462
Listen, if I get hung up,

29:47.462 --> 29:51.424
we'll meet back where
we buried the pilot.

29:53.218 --> 29:55.846
- MacGyver!
- What?

29:57.514 --> 30:01.184
- Don't blow yourself up.
- Okay.

30:11.945 --> 30:14.864
The helicopter has
left the refuelling station.

30:14.864 --> 30:17.075
It should be here
within three hours.

30:17.075 --> 30:20.203
Make the final sweep.
Not a scrap should remain here.

30:20.203 --> 30:22.789
All in this area.

30:29.087 --> 30:32.549
All right, hold it.
Stop, stop, stop.

30:33.174 --> 30:35.802
Okay. Go forward.

31:02.912 --> 31:05.498
Is there anything there?

31:30.314 --> 31:32.942
Are you finished?

32:19.363 --> 32:21.990
MacGyver!

32:34.419 --> 32:37.005
Fire!

33:01.863 --> 33:05.367
We must go.
We must go quickly.

33:11.957 --> 33:17.087
The plane. He has destroyed it all
and probably himself.

33:17.379 --> 33:19.589
Colonel, Starkoss is missing.

33:19.589 --> 33:21.674
I saw him leave the camp.

33:21.674 --> 33:23.718
That traitor.

33:23.718 --> 33:26.096
Assemble the men and notify the border.

33:26.096 --> 33:28.723
Begin a search... now.

33:29.265 --> 33:31.017
Move.

33:31.017 --> 33:34.896
And when you find them,
I want them shot.

33:35.939 --> 33:39.192
Move out! Let's go, quickly! Move!

34:09.054 --> 34:11.139
MacGyver! Thank God.

34:11.139 --> 34:13.351
It's been hours.
Where have you been?

34:13.351 --> 34:15.978
Running and ducking, mostly.

34:16.812 --> 34:18.813
- Were you spotted?
- Probably.

34:18.813 --> 34:22.360
- What about the soldiers?
- They're camped at the crash site.

34:22.360 --> 34:26.864
That chopper's gotta be
running on fumes by now.

34:27.239 --> 34:29.992
Starkoss, how long will it take them

34:29.992 --> 34:33.371
to get to a refuelling base
and back after sunrise?

34:33.371 --> 34:36.498
- Two, maybe three hours.
- That'll give us 1 2 hours.

34:36.498 --> 34:38.626
They'll have sealed off the border.

34:38.626 --> 34:41.462
We'll never make it
down the mountain in the dark.

34:41.462 --> 34:43.047
We're trapped.

34:43.047 --> 34:45.632
Well, maybe...

34:46.132 --> 34:48.719
...maybe not.

34:54.183 --> 34:57.269
Go out to the barracks.
Grab every piece of fabric.

34:57.269 --> 35:00.314
Curtains, tarps, tents.
The lighter the better.

35:00.314 --> 35:03.651
Go. Starkoss,
give me a hand over here.

35:03.651 --> 35:06.654
Help me get this refrigerator up.

35:07.655 --> 35:10.115
Pull this grate off.

35:10.115 --> 35:12.076
You worry.

35:12.076 --> 35:14.912
Worry about the girl.
You worry about me.

35:14.912 --> 35:18.248
We shall not be captured. I know this.

35:18.248 --> 35:21.293
Look, Starkoss,
I'm trying to come up with a plan.

35:21.293 --> 35:24.880
There's welding equipment in the back.
Could you get it for me?

35:24.880 --> 35:29.927
I think it's about time
we start dealing with reality.

35:32.387 --> 35:35.682
You're a serious man.
You're an intellectual man.

35:35.682 --> 35:38.310
You're a man of the mind.

35:38.810 --> 35:41.396
Why do you feel such guilt?

35:41.396 --> 35:43.523
It's all right.

35:43.523 --> 35:45.651
She understands.

35:45.651 --> 35:49.321
- Your mother, she forgives you.
- What?

35:49.488 --> 35:52.115
It's all right.

35:52.115 --> 35:53.992
She understands.

35:53.992 --> 35:56.703
You could not go to the funeral.

35:56.703 --> 36:00.332
She forgives you.
You do not forgive yourself.

36:00.332 --> 36:02.959
But she forgives you.

36:03.668 --> 36:06.588
What kind of a dossier
do you people have on me?

36:06.588 --> 36:09.299
I couldn't be there. There...

36:15.221 --> 36:19.392
Oh, you're good.
You're very good.

36:19.559 --> 36:22.145
You've done your homework.

36:26.816 --> 36:31.362
From the time I was a boy,
I could see pictures.

36:31.613 --> 36:34.783
Pictures of the mind.
And I could do things.

36:34.783 --> 36:38.953
The state took me away,
and I lived with the finest.

36:38.953 --> 36:41.956
And I lived like a king.

36:42.123 --> 36:46.836
But always with doctors.
Always an object of study.

36:46.836 --> 36:49.255
Always a freak.

36:49.255 --> 36:53.092
From what I understand,
you've made the most of your...

36:53.092 --> 36:55.094
...gift.

36:55.094 --> 37:01.642
If it is a gift I have, it is a gift
you would not choose to receive.

37:03.978 --> 37:05.313
Pay dirt.

37:05.313 --> 37:08.566
There's enough bedding,
tents and stuff in the barracks

37:08.566 --> 37:11.110
and in the storage rooms
to outfit an army.

37:11.110 --> 37:17.742
Good, keep it coming, I can use it all.
And grab the pilot's parachute.

37:19.702 --> 37:21.329
The welding equipment.

37:21.329 --> 37:23.956
Please.

37:38.137 --> 37:41.057
Yes, Colonel.
We are returning to base to refuel.

37:41.057 --> 37:43.684
There has been no sign
of Starkoss or the others

37:43.684 --> 37:46.729
since we sighted the man
near the abandoned mine.

37:46.729 --> 37:49.190
Are the troops from the base
on their way in?

37:49.190 --> 37:53.027
Yes. They've established road blocks
and are making their way up.

37:53.027 --> 37:57.406
They should arrive at the abandoned
mine site in approximately three hours.

37:57.406 --> 38:01.869
Good. By that time, we will be in a
position to cut them off from above.

38:01.869 --> 38:05.956
We'll have their bodies
ready for transport.

38:07.916 --> 38:10.544
- Move out.
- Yes, sir.

38:10.544 --> 38:11.920
- Let's go.
- Quickly!

38:11.920 --> 38:14.506
Move, move, move!

38:19.887 --> 38:22.514
This is the last scrap of nylon
I could find.

38:22.514 --> 38:26.143
I hope this superglue of yours
works, MacGyver.

38:26.143 --> 38:29.396
Well, it should,
if I melt it down right.

38:29.396 --> 38:32.024
But we're gonna need more.

38:33.609 --> 38:36.778
Run out of glue.
Something next for me, please.

38:36.778 --> 38:39.364
As a matter of fact,
give me a hand with this.

38:39.364 --> 38:42.159
Here, keep stirring. Come here.

38:52.544 --> 38:55.130
All right. Push.

39:11.980 --> 39:14.191
- Keep moving!
- Yes, sir.

39:14.191 --> 39:16.818
We'll be there in one hour!

39:27.871 --> 39:30.248
I feel time is running short.

39:30.248 --> 39:33.585
Do you want to give me a hand here?

39:35.295 --> 39:36.588
Quickly, let's go.

39:36.588 --> 39:39.174
Hurry!

39:39.257 --> 39:41.843
Let's go!

39:42.135 --> 39:44.762
Come on. Move!

39:45.680 --> 39:48.308
Hurry! Move!

39:50.476 --> 39:52.186
Got something for you.

39:52.186 --> 39:55.273
- A parachute? Why?
- It's the pilot's reserve chute.

39:55.273 --> 39:58.776
- Ever use one of these?
- Once I went skydiving on a dare.

39:58.776 --> 40:00.820
Get your hands up.

40:00.820 --> 40:02.947
What is this for?

40:02.947 --> 40:07.952
- Why are we doing this?
- Do I have to spell it out?

40:10.621 --> 40:13.207
Keep moving!

40:30.933 --> 40:33.811
- Look, what's that?
- A balloon?

40:33.811 --> 40:36.397
What's it doing here?

40:39.817 --> 40:42.403
It's Starkoss! Fire!

40:47.992 --> 40:50.578
Come on! Move!

40:58.461 --> 41:01.088
Kill Starkoss!

41:03.716 --> 41:07.011
Cease firing.
They're out of range.

41:10.097 --> 41:12.891
- Come on.
- Let's go.

41:14.768 --> 41:18.522
Come here. Consider that
a professional congratulations

41:18.522 --> 41:23.485
because I thought we were
dead ducks, but we made it!

41:23.819 --> 41:26.238
Thank you, MacGyver.
Thank you both.

41:26.238 --> 41:28.866
You're very welcome.

41:34.580 --> 41:37.875
Well, Starkoss, you're over
and beyond the border.

41:37.875 --> 41:40.460
You're home free.

41:45.716 --> 41:47.384
- Whoops.
- What is it?

41:47.384 --> 41:50.596
- We're out of gas.
- We made it across the border.

41:50.596 --> 41:55.267
Yeah. But are we
gonna make it over that mountain?

41:56.184 --> 41:59.396
- We must gain altitude.
- Let's steer this. Land it.

41:59.396 --> 42:02.733
Doesn't work that way.
Balloons drift where they're going.

42:02.733 --> 42:05.318
I gotta lighten the load.

42:16.538 --> 42:19.165
Did that help?

42:19.165 --> 42:21.084
It won't carry all three of us.

42:21.084 --> 42:22.460
- What?
- Nikki...

42:22.460 --> 42:25.463
You can't be serious!
Look, you weigh more than I do.

42:25.463 --> 42:29.092
I'd do it. But you've got the chute,
and there's no time to switch.

42:29.092 --> 42:31.886
- You've got to go, now!
- Sorry, there is no time!

42:31.886 --> 42:33.638
You said you did it before.

42:33.638 --> 42:36.224
Get clear of the balloon
and pull the cord.

42:36.224 --> 42:39.018
I can't! MacGyver,
I'll get you for this!

42:39.018 --> 42:41.938
So help me, if I've got to walk
all the way to Munich!

42:41.938 --> 42:43.690
Go! Just go!

42:43.690 --> 42:48.987
I'll see that Pete knows
exactly what you've done to me!

43:02.250 --> 43:05.211
All right, she made it. Okay.

43:08.548 --> 43:11.551
Now we gotta deal
with the mountain.

43:11.551 --> 43:14.846
- Come on. Come on.
- Do not worry.

43:14.929 --> 43:17.557
We'll make it.

43:19.892 --> 43:22.478
Hold on!

43:28.985 --> 43:31.571
All right. I'll take it.

43:31.946 --> 43:35.950
Lucky your Nikki
didn't drift back to the East.

43:35.950 --> 43:40.871
Oh, she'll be all right.
Not too happy, but all right.

43:40.871 --> 43:44.750
That woman...
You will come to love her.

43:44.917 --> 43:46.335
- What?!
- Yes.

43:46.335 --> 43:48.212
No, no, no, no, no. No way.

43:48.212 --> 43:51.257
No. I'm glad she's all right, but...

43:51.257 --> 43:52.675
...trust me.

43:52.675 --> 43:55.594
No, MacGyver. Trust me.

44:05.521 --> 44:08.274
What a flight! What a balloon!

44:08.315 --> 44:10.943
Starkoss, we did it!

44:12.278 --> 44:17.199
We'll contact the American embassy
as soon as we get to Munich.

44:17.199 --> 44:20.577
When we get to your country,

44:20.744 --> 44:26.834
your people'll want to talk to me too,
won't they? Find out what I'm up to.

44:26.834 --> 44:31.046
And get me a place to live
very, very comfortably,

44:31.046 --> 44:34.383
with all the steaks I can eat, huh?

44:36.343 --> 44:39.847
But I'd be prisoner again,
wouldn't I?

44:39.847 --> 44:42.975
I be freak again.
Isn't that so?

44:48.355 --> 44:50.941
Goodbye, my friend.

45:03.870 --> 45:06.915
You! You rat!

45:09.084 --> 45:10.377
You're the lowest!

45:10.377 --> 45:13.880
I should've known there was a reason
you gave me the only chute!

45:13.880 --> 45:15.924
What's next, MacGyver?

45:15.924 --> 45:19.594
Perhaps you'd enjoy dragging me
behind a speeding truck.

45:19.594 --> 45:22.722
Did it even occur to you
I could've landed in a tree?

45:22.722 --> 45:24.933
Or in the middle of an intersection?

45:24.933 --> 45:27.394
What if I hadn't spotted
where you landed?

45:27.394 --> 45:30.355
Did you ever consider that,
Mr Improvise?

45:30.355 --> 45:34.943
And another thing...
Wait a minute. Where's Starkoss?

45:34.943 --> 45:36.861
Don't tell me.

45:36.861 --> 45:40.532
You didn't make him jump too,
did you?
