WEBVTT

00:13.047 --> 00:14.648
It's my opinion

00:14.715 --> 00:17.351
that a custody practice
called bird nesting

00:17.418 --> 00:18.552
is the best course of action.

00:18.619 --> 00:21.322
Great. Yeah.
Driving back and forth

00:21.389 --> 00:24.725
from the Palisades
to Los Feliz...

00:24.792 --> 00:28.962
I'll tell you, it's done
severe psychological
damage to the kids,

00:29.029 --> 00:31.565
like PTSD, you know?

00:31.632 --> 00:34.402
Ella now probably has
a fear of weddings,

00:34.468 --> 00:35.569
- thank you.
- Man: Okay.

00:35.636 --> 00:37.205
- Thank you.
- Zachary and Ella

00:37.271 --> 00:39.373
will stay at
the Los Feliz residence

00:39.440 --> 00:42.676
while each of you takes
turns cohabitating with them.

00:42.743 --> 00:45.346
Sarah, I recommend you
rent an apartment nearby.

00:45.413 --> 00:48.116
Now, some couples share
their secondary apartment.

00:48.182 --> 00:49.683
That's not going to happen.

00:49.750 --> 00:51.185
Fuck, no.

00:54.388 --> 00:58.259
Man: I'd like to recommend
a schedule of 2-2-3.

00:58.326 --> 01:00.928
24 Hour Fitness available
across the street.

01:00.994 --> 01:02.963
Monday, Tuesday is Sarah.

01:03.030 --> 01:05.166
Wednesday, Thursday Len.

01:05.233 --> 01:07.501
Friday, Saturday, Sunday,
you alternate.

01:07.568 --> 01:09.637
...bathroom,
convertible shower heads--

01:09.703 --> 01:11.972
The Los Feliz house now
belongs to your kids.

01:12.039 --> 01:13.141
Woman: Uh, on-site--

01:13.207 --> 01:14.342
It's time
for Zachary and Ella

01:14.408 --> 01:15.776
to get their lives back.

01:15.843 --> 01:17.145
No more chaos.

01:17.145 --> 01:18.779
You have controlled
access elevators.

01:18.846 --> 01:20.381
** [theme]

02:04.758 --> 02:06.827
Teacher:
When we look up at the sky,

02:06.894 --> 02:10.030
we're not seeing
the universe as it is today

02:10.097 --> 02:12.966
but as it was
hundreds, thousands,

02:13.033 --> 02:14.602
millions of years ago.

02:14.668 --> 02:17.671
The multitudinous
past of every star

02:17.738 --> 02:20.341
sending photons
hurtling through space,

02:20.408 --> 02:24.412
each one a clue
as to our origins.

02:24.478 --> 02:27.648
What you are looking at
is the past.

02:29.617 --> 02:31.519
[throbbing]

02:37.791 --> 02:39.693
Oh, my God.

02:44.365 --> 02:48.035
Hurry. I got a target
heartrate to maintain.

02:48.101 --> 02:49.503
What do you think
about this?

02:49.570 --> 02:50.571
No. No.

02:50.638 --> 02:52.072
Ooh, wait a minute.
How about this?

02:52.139 --> 02:53.274
What's that
black and white one?

02:53.341 --> 02:54.875
This one, is this
too water aerobics?

02:54.942 --> 02:56.009
- No.
- No?

02:56.076 --> 02:57.278
No, it's very nice,

02:57.345 --> 02:58.679
especially
with the right sandal.

02:58.746 --> 03:01.315
Oh, God.
People don't even swim
at pool parties.

03:01.382 --> 03:02.716
Can you help me?

03:03.784 --> 03:04.885
I can't--

03:04.952 --> 03:06.520
Here I come to save the day.

03:08.322 --> 03:10.291
It's okay. Don't worry.

03:10.358 --> 03:11.825
You're going to look great.

03:13.427 --> 03:15.296
Ahem. I like this one.

03:16.530 --> 03:17.865
- Shelly: Oi.
- Hello.

03:17.931 --> 03:19.099
Hey, Mrs. P!

03:19.166 --> 03:20.434
Yeah.

03:20.501 --> 03:22.169
You don't by chance
have a timeline

03:22.270 --> 03:23.604
on this storage unit
here, do you?

03:23.671 --> 03:25.573
- No. Why?
- Rosalie Rollman issued

03:25.639 --> 03:28.276
a formal complaint about it
to the condo board.

03:28.309 --> 03:30.411
Rosalie Rollman
can kiss my ass.

03:30.478 --> 03:32.846
She wants a special
assessment for the pond.

03:32.913 --> 03:34.382
Here's my special assessment

03:34.448 --> 03:36.984
for the fakacteh
fershtunkiner pond.

03:37.050 --> 03:38.586
Drain the fucker!

03:38.652 --> 03:40.754
Glad to see
you're working out.

03:42.356 --> 03:45.493
Like we all need duck
and goose shit everywhere.

03:45.559 --> 03:47.761
[laughing] Rosalie Rollman.

03:47.828 --> 03:49.963
I'm going--
I'm going to move this,

03:50.030 --> 03:51.332
this whole thing,
all right?

03:51.399 --> 03:53.301
Because you don't deserve
to be a pariah here.

03:53.334 --> 03:54.635
It's not a big problem.

03:54.702 --> 03:56.637
This makes me feel
like a vagabond anyway.

03:56.704 --> 04:01.742
Ah. You will do
no such thing.

04:01.809 --> 04:06.880
I like you and the box
right here.

04:06.947 --> 04:08.316
Come here.

04:17.958 --> 04:19.993
[knocking]

04:22.162 --> 04:23.230
Hello.

04:23.331 --> 04:25.433
Hey. It's been a while.

04:25.499 --> 04:27.601
- Hi.
- Hi.

04:30.538 --> 04:33.541
Uh, you're--
you're stopping by.

04:33.607 --> 04:37.345
I'm stopping by.
Just a casual stop-by.

04:37.345 --> 04:39.012
All right,
well, come on in.

04:40.180 --> 04:41.449
Nice haircut.

04:41.515 --> 04:43.484
Why, thank you
very much.

04:43.551 --> 04:45.218
That's an interesting
braid. It's like--

04:45.353 --> 04:46.454
- Okay.
- Did you join, like,

04:46.520 --> 04:48.456
a New Wave, like,
polygamous cult?

04:48.522 --> 04:51.124
A little Punk House
On the Prairie?

04:51.191 --> 04:53.761
How did I not
see this coming?

04:53.827 --> 04:56.163
It's also, like, a little bit
like a fly fishing lure.

04:56.229 --> 04:58.666
It's just this
is the back end, you know?

04:58.732 --> 05:00.200
Like A River Runs Through It.

05:00.368 --> 05:01.669
[laughter]

05:01.735 --> 05:04.004
You just, like,
toss you out into the river

05:04.071 --> 05:06.006
and catch a fish.

05:06.073 --> 05:07.274
Are you done?

05:07.375 --> 05:08.576
I have one more.

05:08.642 --> 05:09.577
Okay.

05:09.643 --> 05:11.011
I feel like I
could also, like,

05:11.078 --> 05:12.513
set up a badminton net
in here

05:12.580 --> 05:14.147
and use your head
like a shuttlecock.

05:14.214 --> 05:15.416
Sorry.

05:15.483 --> 05:17.184
You just wanted
to say shuttlecock.

05:17.250 --> 05:18.285
Yeah. It's cute.

05:18.386 --> 05:19.820
Thank you.

05:19.887 --> 05:20.921
From this angle.

05:21.955 --> 05:23.657
Are you done
making fun of me?

05:23.724 --> 05:25.058
Never.

05:25.125 --> 05:27.595
Isn't that
why you came back?

05:29.062 --> 05:30.398
I guess so.

05:30.398 --> 05:34.167
I also very much
have been wanting

05:34.234 --> 05:35.869
to say that I'm sorry

05:35.936 --> 05:40.073
and that I-- I hope
you will take me

05:40.140 --> 05:41.709
as your friend again.

05:41.775 --> 05:44.177
I will take you
as my friend again.

05:44.244 --> 05:46.914
Okay, let's be friends.

05:46.980 --> 05:48.449
Uh, okay.

05:48.516 --> 05:49.583
Short notice.

05:49.650 --> 05:51.251
I'm having people
over tonight.

05:51.318 --> 05:53.754
Low key.
We're going to play Mafia,

05:53.821 --> 05:56.524
do a bunch of hard drugs.
Not really.

05:56.590 --> 05:58.058
Um, do you want to come?

05:59.627 --> 06:01.094
Woman: Tell me more
about Danielle.

06:01.161 --> 06:03.330
Yeah, she, uh,
she's Mrs. Ambition.

06:03.431 --> 06:05.433
She's, like,
the right hand lady
to the CEO,

06:05.499 --> 06:09.870
so, I mean, she was hired
as just an admin, and--

06:09.937 --> 06:11.238
Rita: Leo Carrillo?

06:11.304 --> 06:12.506
Hmm?

06:12.573 --> 06:15.943
Leo Carrillo?

06:16.009 --> 06:18.446
What's-- What-- What?

06:18.479 --> 06:21.248
Leo Carrillo. The beach.

06:21.314 --> 06:22.450
He said you were
going swimming.

06:22.516 --> 06:23.484
Oh. The beach.

06:23.551 --> 06:24.985
We used to go there.

06:25.052 --> 06:26.186
Got it. No.

06:26.253 --> 06:27.455
We're having
a thing at the house,

06:27.521 --> 06:28.922
a pool thing.

06:28.989 --> 06:30.323
Oh, a pool thing.

06:30.458 --> 06:31.792
It's an industry party.

06:31.859 --> 06:32.993
Mm-hmm.

06:33.060 --> 06:34.094
I'm debuting my new band.

06:34.161 --> 06:35.563
He'll be impressed.

06:35.629 --> 06:37.565
- [door opens]
- Colton?

06:37.631 --> 06:39.099
- Yeah.
- You ready, bud?

06:39.166 --> 06:40.868
- Yeah. Sorry.
- 'Sup?

06:40.934 --> 06:42.369
- So want to hit it?
- Yeah.

06:42.470 --> 06:44.505
Come here.
Give Mama a kiss.

06:44.572 --> 06:46.774
Mm-mm-mm. Have fun.

06:46.840 --> 06:48.509
All right.

06:48.576 --> 06:50.110
Actually, I've been
meaning to talk to you.

06:50.177 --> 06:52.480
I'm thinking about
staying in Los Angeles
for senior year.

06:52.480 --> 06:54.147
- Really?
- Yeah.

06:54.214 --> 06:57.651
Oh. Were Rita and your
parents cool with that?

06:57.718 --> 06:59.219
Yeah, my parents are
totally cool with it.

06:59.286 --> 07:01.388
And actually,
it was Rita's idea.

07:01.489 --> 07:03.924
She says she feels greedy,
you know, for me,

07:03.991 --> 07:05.893
seeing as she hasn't
had me till now.

07:05.959 --> 07:08.629
- Right.
- Hey, guys. Hey, Colton.

07:08.696 --> 07:10.598
- Hey, Rabbi.
- Look at your swim trunks.

07:10.664 --> 07:12.099
You ready for a pool party?

07:12.165 --> 07:13.166
Oh, yeah.

07:14.334 --> 07:15.736
Come on in
the front seat.

07:15.803 --> 07:17.905
You're riding shotgun with
those long legs of yours.

07:17.971 --> 07:19.673
No. I'll squish them.
I don't mind.

07:19.740 --> 07:20.841
- I appreciate it.
- I insist.

07:20.908 --> 07:22.142
Yo, go, go, go,
go, go, go.

07:22.209 --> 07:23.511
- Come here.
- Go, go, go, go, go, go.

07:23.511 --> 07:24.545
- Sure?
- Let's do this.

07:24.612 --> 07:25.779
- You sure?
- Yes, please.

07:25.846 --> 07:27.815
- I feel weird.
- Sit inside of the car.

07:27.881 --> 07:29.517
- Hey. Guess what.
- Yeah. Huh?

07:29.583 --> 07:31.685
This guy is going
to live in L.A.,

07:31.752 --> 07:33.353
maybe do his
senior year here.

07:33.420 --> 07:35.322
Right?

07:35.388 --> 07:36.657
Wow. That's--

07:36.724 --> 07:39.026
Wait, is Rita cool with this?

07:39.092 --> 07:40.127
Is that what she--

07:40.193 --> 07:41.595
Yeah.
It was Rita's idea.

07:41.662 --> 07:42.930
- Yeah.
- Wow.

07:42.996 --> 07:43.764
I know, right?

07:43.831 --> 07:45.365
It's a really nice car.

07:45.432 --> 07:46.534
Yeah.

07:46.534 --> 07:48.168
Uh, you guys ready?

07:48.235 --> 07:49.537
- Mm.
- Okay.

07:49.570 --> 07:50.871
[engine starts]

07:57.177 --> 07:58.278
These work, right?

07:58.345 --> 07:59.580
Shelly: Beautiful.

07:59.647 --> 08:01.348
They're gorgeous.
You got boobies.

08:01.414 --> 08:03.150
- Well, no.
- I never saw boobies before.

08:03.216 --> 08:04.818
- I've never worn boobies.
- Oh, you're wearing them.

08:04.885 --> 08:06.887
I could even
bump it up one size.

08:06.954 --> 08:08.288
- You could.
- Because I'm tall.

08:08.355 --> 08:09.623
Yeah.

08:09.690 --> 08:11.291
This under here
is a disaster.

08:11.358 --> 08:12.926
- We all have that.
- From doing these, you know?

08:12.993 --> 08:15.028
It's skin.
You can't tighten skin.

08:15.095 --> 08:16.463
Looks good, right?

08:16.564 --> 08:17.565
Oh, it's much better.

08:17.631 --> 08:18.799
I'll put the hair up.

08:18.866 --> 08:20.267
- The hair up is gorgeous.
- Right?

08:20.333 --> 08:21.602
You know,
the eye makeup

08:21.669 --> 08:23.070
actually draws your
attention away.

08:23.136 --> 08:24.171
I'm just going to do this.

08:24.237 --> 08:25.338
I'm not going to-- I'm--

08:25.405 --> 08:26.907
I'm-- You okay?

08:26.974 --> 08:29.176
Uh, do you get--

08:29.242 --> 08:30.644
hand me my Jean NatÃ©?

08:30.711 --> 08:33.313
It's in the bottom cabinet
under the sink.

08:33.380 --> 08:35.082
You remember Jean NatÃ©,
right?

08:35.148 --> 08:37.017
Ah, yes. Oh, I like this.

08:37.084 --> 08:38.051
I'm going to do some.

08:38.118 --> 08:39.086
Give me a little.

08:39.152 --> 08:40.120
Just a little.

08:40.187 --> 08:41.589
Oi! Oi! Oi! Oi! Oi!

08:41.655 --> 08:43.023
I told you it was cold.

08:43.090 --> 08:44.057
[laughing]

08:46.226 --> 08:47.194
All right.

08:47.260 --> 08:50.598
We had some good times.

08:50.631 --> 08:51.799
We had good times.

08:51.865 --> 08:53.033
They weren't all bad times.

08:53.100 --> 08:54.301
Not all bad times.

08:54.367 --> 08:56.369
Nobody makes me
laugh like you.

08:56.436 --> 08:57.905
Ah.

09:00.240 --> 09:03.877
You know that thing you used
to do with your finger?

09:03.944 --> 09:06.313
Hmm? Nobody could
do that like you.

09:06.379 --> 09:07.648
There are other people.

09:07.715 --> 09:11.251
No. You have a talent.

09:11.318 --> 09:13.621
What did we used to call it?

09:13.621 --> 09:17.124
It's the flicky-flicky
thump-thump.

09:17.190 --> 09:19.860
Flickety-flicky...

09:19.927 --> 09:22.796
Flickety-flickety--
Don't make me do this.

09:22.863 --> 09:24.164
Do it.

09:24.231 --> 09:26.634
Flickety-flickety--

09:27.635 --> 09:28.869
Thump-thump.

09:28.936 --> 09:30.638
Good. All right,
you good?

09:30.638 --> 09:31.772
No, no.

09:31.839 --> 09:33.741
- * La la la la la la *
- Stop it.

09:33.807 --> 09:35.308
Oh, you're a bad girl.

09:35.375 --> 09:38.478
I'm a very, very bad girl.

09:38.545 --> 09:42.282
Oh, that feels...good.

09:42.349 --> 09:45.218
Ohh.

09:45.285 --> 09:46.386
Ohh.

09:46.453 --> 09:49.222
Oh, my God,
That feels so good.

09:57.665 --> 09:58.999
Ohh.

09:59.066 --> 10:00.067
[gasp]

10:00.133 --> 10:01.601
Ohh.

10:01.669 --> 10:03.270
- Ohh.
- Easy.

10:03.336 --> 10:04.905
Mm.

10:04.972 --> 10:06.907
Mm.

10:06.974 --> 10:08.575
- Mm.
- Let me do that.

10:08.642 --> 10:11.011
Okay. Ahh.

10:11.078 --> 10:12.179
Easy.

10:12.245 --> 10:13.947
Ahh.

10:14.014 --> 10:16.216
Ah. Ohh.

10:16.283 --> 10:17.250
Ohh.

10:17.317 --> 10:19.019
Ohh! Ohh!

10:19.086 --> 10:20.553
Uhh! Ohh!

10:20.620 --> 10:22.355
Oh! Oh!

10:22.422 --> 10:25.225
Oh! God!

10:25.292 --> 10:27.094
Oh, G--

10:27.160 --> 10:28.328
Oh, God.

10:28.395 --> 10:30.831
[panting, laughing]

10:30.898 --> 10:32.432
Shh, shh, shh, shh.

10:32.499 --> 10:34.134
Heh heh heh heh.

10:34.201 --> 10:35.468
Ohh.

10:35.535 --> 10:36.804
All right?

10:40.107 --> 10:41.074
Ohh.

10:48.682 --> 10:50.217
Your turn.

10:50.283 --> 10:51.618
I'm good.

10:51.685 --> 10:52.853
Come on.

10:54.287 --> 10:55.222
Come here.

10:55.288 --> 10:56.556
I'm good.

10:56.623 --> 10:58.058
Really, I am.

10:59.126 --> 11:00.560
Close your eyes.

11:00.728 --> 11:01.862
[door opens]

11:09.469 --> 11:11.138
Where are all the people?

11:11.204 --> 11:13.306
Josh promised not to let
them in the house

11:13.373 --> 11:14.808
so he doesn't damage anything.

11:14.875 --> 11:16.409
Wouldn't it
damage their eyes

11:16.476 --> 11:17.745
with the hideous
monstrosity

11:17.811 --> 11:19.780
that is the taste
of Tammy Cashman?

11:19.847 --> 11:23.416
God. It really is horrendous.

11:23.483 --> 11:25.085
How did I not see this?

11:25.152 --> 11:29.022
You had your foggy fuck
goggles on too tight.

11:29.089 --> 11:30.323
Jesus.

11:30.390 --> 11:32.192
Is that Dana Devon?

11:32.259 --> 11:35.662
It's every L.A.
industry douche bag.

11:35.763 --> 11:37.264
It's a party.

11:37.330 --> 11:38.131
Raquel?

11:38.198 --> 11:39.632
- You found them?
- No.

11:39.767 --> 11:40.801
What about
the laundry room?

11:40.868 --> 11:41.902
- Ah. Okay.
- Okay.

11:41.969 --> 11:43.937
My sisters are here.

11:44.004 --> 11:45.372
They're sneaking in the back.

11:45.438 --> 11:46.774
It's a sneak attack.

11:46.774 --> 11:47.808
Raquel: They're right here.
You were right.

11:47.875 --> 11:49.242
- Okay.
- Here.

11:49.309 --> 11:51.779
That's what I'm talking
about. So beautiful.

11:51.812 --> 11:55.482
Saving the day.
Listen, come help me
pinch roll these towels.

11:55.548 --> 11:57.785
We need to make them tight
like the Four Seasons.

11:57.785 --> 11:58.986
How are you holding up?

11:59.052 --> 12:01.321
Yeah, I'm alright.
You know. Oddly okay.

12:01.388 --> 12:03.857
Alone in-- in jail.

12:04.958 --> 12:06.226
Well,
I thought that the email

12:06.293 --> 12:07.660
you sent to everybody
explaining

12:07.795 --> 12:09.462
how it's over
between you and Tammy

12:09.529 --> 12:10.998
was really,
really beautiful.

12:11.064 --> 12:12.900
- Really?
- Yeah, so well worded.

12:12.966 --> 12:14.802
- Thanks.
- Ali: You didn't BCC.

12:14.835 --> 12:15.903
I didn't? What?

12:15.969 --> 12:17.604
Sarah, I told you
you got to BCC.

12:17.670 --> 12:19.039
It's totally
unprofesh.

12:19.106 --> 12:20.573
I don't get the--
I just can't fucking

12:20.640 --> 12:22.675
get the CC BC--
I don't understand.

12:22.810 --> 12:24.244
By the way, did I
tell you who's coming?

12:24.311 --> 12:26.279
Please tell me it's
Ruth Bader Ginsberg.

12:26.346 --> 12:27.714
Mama and Maupa.

12:27.815 --> 12:29.282
You're saying it
like they're a couple.

12:29.349 --> 12:30.450
- What?
- Ew.

12:30.517 --> 12:32.019
Please tell me
that's not true.

12:32.085 --> 12:33.186
No. I think I might have
got a whiff of that shit.

12:33.253 --> 12:34.922
- No, no, no, no, no.
- No, for real.

12:34.988 --> 12:36.723
- I'm just saying.
- The wedding cake is in here.

12:36.824 --> 12:37.858
[gasp] Yes.

12:37.925 --> 12:39.592
Right? I'm going
to put it out.

12:39.659 --> 12:40.828
Oh, no, no, no.

12:40.828 --> 12:42.262
That cake is
fucking delicious.

12:42.329 --> 12:44.097
This is catered. We're not
doing old-ass wedding cake.

12:44.164 --> 12:46.299
That cake was the best
thing about that wedding.

12:46.366 --> 12:48.135
Maura: The original
owners are here. Hi.

12:48.201 --> 12:50.037
Oh, my God,
I'm so hungry.

12:50.103 --> 12:51.504
How are you, my pretty girl?

12:51.571 --> 12:53.841
Hello, baby, hello.

12:53.874 --> 12:55.208
- Hi.
- Oh, you, you, you, you, you.

12:55.275 --> 12:56.276
Mwah. Hello.

12:56.343 --> 12:58.846
So I hear you two
are lesbians now.

13:02.249 --> 13:05.118
No. I'm just living
with your mom temporarily

13:05.185 --> 13:07.520
since Shangri La went condo
and kicked out the queers.

13:07.587 --> 13:10.423
I can't figure out
what I'm doing quite yet.

13:10.490 --> 13:11.524
Uh, I may buy.

13:11.591 --> 13:13.961
You may buy? You
already own this house

13:14.027 --> 13:15.428
that we're standing in.
Why don't you live here?

13:15.495 --> 13:17.330
No, this will never
be my home again.

13:17.397 --> 13:20.300
So, uh,
did you call ahead

13:20.367 --> 13:22.769
and tell the kids
about bathie time?

13:22.870 --> 13:24.004
Sarah:
Aren't you supposed
to wash those?

13:24.071 --> 13:25.005
- I--
- Shush.

13:25.072 --> 13:26.239
Josh: They look fantastic.

13:26.306 --> 13:27.707
They're, like,
covered in chemicals.

13:27.774 --> 13:29.409
**

13:29.476 --> 13:31.945
[chatter]

13:37.084 --> 13:38.285
- Maupa?
- Mm-hmm.

13:38.351 --> 13:39.920
Uh, I've been
in touch with Simon,

13:39.987 --> 13:42.722
and I was thinking about
going to see Grandma Rose.

13:42.789 --> 13:43.957
And I thought
you might want to come

13:44.024 --> 13:45.058
'cause it's been
a really long time.

13:45.125 --> 13:46.326
Well, yes, it has

13:46.393 --> 13:47.995
because I was banned
from seeing her.

13:48.061 --> 13:49.229
I know, and I'm sorry.

13:49.296 --> 13:50.563
Briana was horrible to me.

13:50.630 --> 13:52.365
Briana has always
been horrible to me.

13:52.432 --> 13:54.201
Okay, but Grandma Rose
might not be around

13:54.267 --> 13:56.469
- for very much longer.
- I know. She might not.

13:58.805 --> 14:00.540
Wow.

14:00.607 --> 14:03.010
Hell, no.
Let the music free
your mind, okay?

14:03.076 --> 14:05.012
This is literally
the last time

14:05.078 --> 14:07.514
the three of you
won't be creeped on

14:07.580 --> 14:08.748
by fans at a party.

14:08.815 --> 14:10.350
- Damn.
- Look at him, yeah.

14:10.417 --> 14:11.952
Your son is built!

14:12.019 --> 14:13.086
- Oh.
- Yes.

14:13.153 --> 14:14.454
Yeah, that's my seed.

14:14.521 --> 14:16.356
That's a good wholesome
kid over there.

14:16.423 --> 14:17.290
- Hello!
- Yeah.

14:17.357 --> 14:19.692
That is grade A
grass-fed beef.

14:19.759 --> 14:20.727
What?

14:20.793 --> 14:21.995
What?

14:22.062 --> 14:23.663
Is this Fussy Puss?

14:23.730 --> 14:25.465
Oh! He be here.

14:25.532 --> 14:27.700
At hashtag Fussy--

14:27.767 --> 14:29.569
Margaux with an X?

14:29.636 --> 14:30.670
- Yes.
- Right?

14:30.737 --> 14:31.972
And then it's Agnyss with a Y.

14:32.039 --> 14:33.173
Hi. I'm Barry.

14:33.240 --> 14:35.075
I haven't yet-- Hi.

14:35.142 --> 14:36.309
- Bianca.
- Bian-- Just--

14:36.376 --> 14:37.844
It's just--
Hi. How's it going?

14:37.945 --> 14:39.779
- My man. How's it going?
- Yes.

14:39.846 --> 14:40.948
Thanks for being here.

14:40.981 --> 14:42.015
You guys, I'm so excited.

14:42.082 --> 14:43.316
I'm so excited
to hear you play.

14:43.383 --> 14:44.317
Hey, sweetheart,

14:44.384 --> 14:46.086
you should put
some sunscreen on.

14:46.153 --> 14:47.387
You're very white.

14:47.454 --> 14:48.956
I've been
reapplying all day.

14:48.989 --> 14:50.323
I think it's
from Rita's side.

14:50.390 --> 14:51.791
- Ah.
- Yeah.

14:51.858 --> 14:54.694
Hey, I looked up "trans"
on YouTube the other day.

14:54.761 --> 14:57.064
I saw this--
this really funny lady.

14:57.130 --> 14:58.966
She wears a cape.

14:58.999 --> 15:01.768
Uh, is that, like,
a-- a trans thing?

15:01.834 --> 15:03.470
No, no. I don't think so.

15:03.536 --> 15:05.838
I think that's more
like a YouTube thing.

15:05.973 --> 15:07.474
Oh.

15:07.540 --> 15:09.542
Okay. Good talk.

15:09.609 --> 15:10.978
- Good.
- Bye.

15:13.680 --> 15:15.983
Colton.

15:16.016 --> 15:18.151
** [techno beat]

15:20.053 --> 15:21.354
- Mom.
- Who's she?

15:25.825 --> 15:28.528
I got to be honest. I did
not think you would come.

15:28.595 --> 15:29.896
Of course I came.

15:29.997 --> 15:31.198
No, man,
I'm going to stay here

15:31.264 --> 15:32.832
until you throw a chair
at me.

15:32.899 --> 15:34.001
- Oh.
- That's what my goal is.

15:34.067 --> 15:35.168
- Okay.
- I'm going to make you

15:35.235 --> 15:36.303
throw furniture
at my head

15:36.369 --> 15:37.570
every time
we see each other.

15:37.637 --> 15:39.006
It'll be inflated
if it happens this time.

15:39.039 --> 15:40.073
Listen, listen, listen.

15:40.140 --> 15:41.274
I want you to hear the girls.

15:41.341 --> 15:42.075
Yeah, yeah.

15:42.142 --> 15:43.376
If you like them,

15:43.443 --> 15:45.412
I want to talk about
your Inner Scope imprint.

15:45.478 --> 15:48.081
Oh, Joshie, you just
gave me a boner.

15:48.148 --> 15:49.616
That's what I'm
talking about.

15:49.682 --> 15:50.917
Okay, we can talk.

15:51.018 --> 15:52.119
But you cannot leave
until you hear them.

15:52.185 --> 15:53.420
No, I'll stay.
Of course, man.

15:53.486 --> 15:54.421
All right.

15:57.790 --> 15:59.192
Where are your kids?

15:59.259 --> 16:03.130
They're in Big Bear
with Len and Melanie,

16:03.196 --> 16:05.298
probably dehydrated
and covered in ticks,

16:05.365 --> 16:09.302
but hey, I mean, I can't--
can't take care of everyone.

16:09.369 --> 16:12.605
Got to take care of me.
Need some me time right now.

16:12.672 --> 16:14.807
Get my me on.

16:14.874 --> 16:16.443
You know, I, uh,

16:16.509 --> 16:20.480
I lead a-- a study group
in the Torah of healing.

16:20.547 --> 16:22.149
Is that something
you would love to--

16:22.215 --> 16:24.317
just drop in.
I'd love to have you.

16:24.384 --> 16:25.718
- You want a drink?
- You could get--

16:27.154 --> 16:28.588
I'm pregnant.

16:28.655 --> 16:30.757
Oh. That's right.

16:34.594 --> 16:35.562
Hi, darling.

16:37.264 --> 16:39.166
Come sit with me.

16:40.333 --> 16:41.434
Come on.

16:43.436 --> 16:45.172
Wooo!

16:45.238 --> 16:47.440
* You are the only one *

16:47.507 --> 16:49.742
* That I've been
thinking of *

16:51.244 --> 16:53.380
Elliot, I want you to meet
Margaux right here.

16:53.446 --> 16:56.249
This is Elliot Weiss.
He's A&R for Capitol Records.

16:56.316 --> 16:57.917
Hi.

16:57.984 --> 16:59.919
Hey.

16:59.986 --> 17:01.321
Turns out I love the flavor

17:01.388 --> 17:03.256
of lost lesbian
wedding dream cake.

17:03.323 --> 17:04.757
Look at your brother.

17:04.824 --> 17:06.893
Joshie
is in his kingdom.

17:06.959 --> 17:09.096
Yep. It's a fairy tale.

17:09.129 --> 17:12.199
And I'm merely the troll
that spins the perimeter

17:12.265 --> 17:15.335
of the murky, murky moat.

17:17.704 --> 17:19.206
Why do you do that?

17:19.272 --> 17:22.375
Why do you always
put yourself down?

17:22.442 --> 17:24.377
* Why play these games *

17:24.444 --> 17:26.779
* We play when they
don't go nowhere? *

17:26.846 --> 17:29.282
* Why play
these games we play? *

17:29.349 --> 17:31.184
* Girl, let's just
go somewhere *

17:31.251 --> 17:32.619
* I'll dive into-- *

17:43.663 --> 17:44.631
[laughter]

17:55.508 --> 17:58.745
Josh: This is like
a motherfucking
dream up in here!

17:58.811 --> 18:00.147
The moment has arrived.

18:00.180 --> 18:01.581
Fussy Puss.

18:19.399 --> 18:21.601
*Now I've seen enough *

18:23.336 --> 18:25.071
*Of your dirty love *

* Now I got you out *

18:34.881 --> 18:36.516
*I just want you gone *

18:38.050 --> 18:40.086
*I need to be alone *

18:40.187 --> 18:42.021
*Your dirty magic *

18:42.088 --> 18:44.191
*You broke in my heart *

18:46.058 --> 18:47.560
*With your black heart *

18:47.627 --> 18:48.928
*Now the power's out *

18:48.995 --> 18:51.097
*And you are thin air *

18:51.198 --> 18:52.565
*What an illusion *

18:52.632 --> 18:55.067
* I could have sworn
that you were there *

*Smoke and mirrors *

*You were just a-- *

18:57.870 --> 18:59.038
Dude, they're really good.

18:59.105 --> 19:00.540
- * ...hologram *
- I know.

19:00.607 --> 19:03.843
They're like money-money
baby-baby good.

19:03.910 --> 19:05.912
* And you are thin air *

19:05.978 --> 19:07.547
* What an illusion *

19:07.614 --> 19:09.416

19:09.482 --> 19:11.218

19:29.101 --> 19:32.439
* I no longer cry *

19:32.505 --> 19:34.140
*Now the power's out *

19:34.241 --> 19:36.075
*And you are thin air *

[crowd gasping]

20:04.937 --> 20:06.439
Tammy: Hi.

20:06.506 --> 20:09.276
Hi, everybody!
Are we having fun?

20:09.342 --> 20:11.578
And Bianca's here,
so that's good

20:11.644 --> 20:13.413
because Bianca's
always at a party

20:13.480 --> 20:15.248
because you're a party
girl, aren't you, baby?

20:15.315 --> 20:16.616
It's cool, everybody.

20:16.683 --> 20:18.251
You're a party girl.
No, I'm good.

20:18.318 --> 20:19.819
- No, I'm good.
- Tammy, let's go inside.

20:19.886 --> 20:21.721
I'm good. I'm good.
Don't worry. I'm good.

20:21.788 --> 20:23.490
- Get the fuck inside.
- No. Fuck off, Josh.

20:23.556 --> 20:26.092
- You're not coming in--
- Fuck off. You fuck off.

20:26.158 --> 20:28.595
[gasping, murmuring]

20:29.462 --> 20:31.197
- Guys.
- I'll deck you.

20:31.264 --> 20:32.932
Hi, everybody.

20:32.999 --> 20:35.234
My name's Tammy,
if you don't know who I am,

20:35.302 --> 20:38.505
and I'm here because
we're having a little--

20:38.571 --> 20:40.607
- What are we celebrating?
- Go home, sweetheart.

20:40.673 --> 20:42.475
- No, sweetheart. Come on.
- [microphone feedback]

20:42.542 --> 20:43.710
I don't really understand
why we're having a party

20:43.776 --> 20:45.244
and I didn't get
an invitation.

20:45.312 --> 20:46.646
Are you drunk?
You're 12 years sober.

20:46.713 --> 20:47.914
- Sweetie, you're--
- What are we doing?

20:47.980 --> 20:49.081
Hey, Colton.

20:49.148 --> 20:50.683
I think we should
just go inside.

20:50.750 --> 20:52.218
We got to take her
out of here.

20:52.285 --> 20:53.753
Why are we
having the party?

20:53.820 --> 20:55.855
I don't understand
why we're having a party!

20:55.922 --> 20:57.424
- It doesn't have to be this--
- Just go.

20:57.490 --> 20:59.392
- Let me go!
- You guys, this is crazy.

20:59.459 --> 21:01.093
Fucking let me go.

21:01.160 --> 21:02.329
Get out of here.

21:02.329 --> 21:03.563
Fuck you.

21:04.631 --> 21:06.132
You know what, Sarah?

21:06.198 --> 21:08.335
I am a beautiful soul.

21:09.235 --> 21:12.104
And you are all...

21:12.171 --> 21:14.006
monsters.

21:20.647 --> 21:21.948
Hey. Hey!

21:22.014 --> 21:23.416
No, no, no, no!

21:23.483 --> 21:24.517
- No.
- Tam--

21:24.584 --> 21:25.985
This is crazy.
That's enough.

21:26.052 --> 21:27.554
This is our wedding cake.

21:27.620 --> 21:28.821
This is our cake.

21:28.888 --> 21:30.423
- Sarah, this is our cake.
- Tammy--

21:30.490 --> 21:32.592
Remember we went to that
sweet little shop in Venice

21:32.659 --> 21:34.226
and we tried, like,
12 different cakes?

21:34.361 --> 21:36.195
Remember, honey,
we fell in love with this?

21:36.262 --> 21:38.998
- Sarah, okay?
- [Tammy gibbering]

21:39.065 --> 21:40.367
Sarah: Just calm down.

21:40.400 --> 21:41.668
- I have a beautiful soul.
- Yes, you do.

21:41.734 --> 21:43.269
I have the soul
of a warrior!

21:43.370 --> 21:44.604
- Yes, you do.
- I do!

21:44.671 --> 21:46.539
- Yes.
- And you have crushed it!

21:46.606 --> 21:48.675
You have ruined my life!

21:48.741 --> 21:51.478
You think there's
no fucking consequence?

21:51.544 --> 21:52.712
I am a fucking conse--

21:52.779 --> 21:53.546
It's not-- Okay.

21:53.613 --> 21:55.247
I am a fucking consequence.

21:55.382 --> 21:57.049
You're all waiting,
aren't you?

21:57.116 --> 21:59.752
You're waiting for me to stop
so you can tell everybody--

21:59.819 --> 22:01.187
- Yeah.
- ...how crazy I am!

22:01.388 --> 22:02.188
It's just--

22:02.254 --> 22:03.423
Well, I am not crazy!

22:03.490 --> 22:05.925
You're crazy! I am in pain!

22:05.992 --> 22:09.896
I am your pain!

22:12.499 --> 22:13.900
No, no, no. Don't.

22:13.966 --> 22:16.168
[gasping, murmuring]

22:16.235 --> 22:17.570
Go fuck yourselves.

22:17.637 --> 22:19.205
- Let's go, let's go.
- Oh, God.

22:19.271 --> 22:21.408
[sobbing]

22:30.450 --> 22:32.852
I'm fine, okay?
I'm fine.

22:39.125 --> 22:40.059
**

22:40.126 --> 22:41.461
[vocalizing]

22:43.095 --> 22:44.196
Do me a favor.

22:44.263 --> 22:46.533
Tell your sister
to take Mom home,

22:46.599 --> 22:48.701
all right? I have
to make a stop.

22:48.768 --> 22:50.770
Okay.

22:50.837 --> 22:52.705
- Can't you tell her?
- No.

23:01.981 --> 23:05.452
Isn't it weird
that that whole time
down by the pool...

23:06.919 --> 23:10.723
the one person that I could
not keep my eyes off of...

23:12.224 --> 23:13.860
was Colton?

23:18.164 --> 23:20.833
Standing there
all by himself.

23:22.469 --> 23:24.604
The Cross necklace.

23:26.706 --> 23:29.041
I just want
to protect him.

23:59.171 --> 24:03.075
You...me...

24:03.142 --> 24:04.911
new baby...

24:06.212 --> 24:08.214
and Colton...

24:09.549 --> 24:11.518
we need to live
in this house.

24:14.253 --> 24:16.689
It's a big house.

24:18.324 --> 24:21.093
It has a big feeling.

24:24.597 --> 24:26.265
- Shelly: Okay.
- You need help with that?

24:26.332 --> 24:27.433
No, no. I got it.

24:27.534 --> 24:28.568
Do you want me to walk you?

24:28.635 --> 24:30.436
I can function.
I can manage.

24:30.537 --> 24:32.605
Okay, dolly, b-- Oh.

24:35.575 --> 24:37.744
All right. Bye, Mom.
Love you.

24:39.211 --> 24:41.781
Okay. Ohh.

24:41.848 --> 24:43.115
All right.

24:44.551 --> 24:46.553
Watch your hand.

24:46.619 --> 24:47.820
Good night, dolly.

24:47.887 --> 24:49.121
* Walking up to me *

24:49.188 --> 24:51.558

*Expecting words *

24:53.425 --> 24:55.595
*Happens all the time *

25:00.399 --> 25:02.268
- Hey.
- Hi.

25:02.334 --> 25:03.670
I didn't think
you were going to come.

25:03.736 --> 25:05.572
I know, but it turns out

25:05.638 --> 25:06.973
I just needed
to have a party.

25:07.039 --> 25:08.307
- Yeah. Okay.
- How you doing?

25:08.374 --> 25:09.809
I'm good. Remember Ali?

25:09.876 --> 25:11.410
- This is Georgina Cole.
- Oh, hi.

25:11.477 --> 25:12.579
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

25:12.612 --> 25:13.946

Can we just cheers?
I need to drink so bad.

25:16.282 --> 25:18.384
Yes. Why? Cheers.

25:18.450 --> 25:20.252
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

25:20.319 --> 25:21.854
Cheers.

25:43.475 --> 25:44.611

25:53.620 --> 25:55.922
[gasp] She's smoking.

25:57.624 --> 25:59.626
I think they both
want to come over.

25:59.692 --> 26:01.694
- I'll take them both.
- I will.

26:03.329 --> 26:04.631
How are you?

26:04.697 --> 26:06.633
Hi. Hi. Davina.

This is Maura.
That's Roger.

You girls want to dance?

Yeah. Sure.

26:13.505 --> 26:15.374

26:15.441 --> 26:17.009
You don't want to come?

You sure?
