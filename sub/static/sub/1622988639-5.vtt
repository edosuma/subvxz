00:08.299 --> 00:10.635
[Jack] When did you start
thinking about a baby?

00:13.138 --> 00:14.180
[quietly] Um…

00:16.141 --> 00:20.228
[hesitates] After the accident,
I didn't think that I could get pregnant.

00:21.938 --> 00:25.608
So I just kept telling myself
that I didn't need to be a mom.

00:29.404 --> 00:32.115
But every time I see Lilly with Chloe, I--

00:35.910 --> 00:37.370
My heart aches.

00:39.497 --> 00:40.540
[Jack, softly] Yeah.

00:42.292 --> 00:43.501
And how come you didn't…

00:45.503 --> 00:46.880
say anything until now?

00:48.673 --> 00:52.093
Well, because, you know,
we'd just started dating, and you…

00:52.927 --> 00:55.472
[scoffs] …you have twins on the way,

00:57.223 --> 01:00.310
and I just-- I know this feeling
isn't gonna go away.

01:02.020 --> 01:02.937
And…

01:04.647 --> 01:06.107
[sighs]

01:06.191 --> 01:08.943
…I feel like I owe it to myself to try.

01:12.781 --> 01:15.075
Well, it's hard
to argue with your feelings.

01:20.705 --> 01:23.208
I should've just
kept the baby thing to myself.

01:23.291 --> 01:26.211
-I just--
-No. Hey, hey. Come on.

01:26.294 --> 01:29.339
-[Mel groans]
-No. Listen, you did the right thing.

01:32.258 --> 01:35.220
I wanna know what's going on
in that beautiful head of yours.

01:36.096 --> 01:39.808
Yeah, well, right now,
it's mostly filled with regret.

01:42.602 --> 01:45.230
[Mel breathes deeply]

01:45.313 --> 01:47.649
Just because I want to have a baby,

01:47.732 --> 01:50.819
it doesn't mean
that you have to feel the same way.

01:51.653 --> 01:52.737
You know, I mean, I…

01:53.863 --> 01:55.907
I totally understand if you don't.

02:03.289 --> 02:04.374
[Mel chuckles softly]

02:05.333 --> 02:06.709
[Jack] I should, um…

02:09.629 --> 02:10.588
Just…

02:12.590 --> 02:16.970
-I'll need time to think things through.
-Yeah, of course. I-- Of course.

02:20.056 --> 02:20.890
[quietly] Yeah.

02:22.392 --> 02:24.269
-Hey.
-Hm?

02:25.979 --> 02:27.272
I'm glad you told me.

02:32.652 --> 02:35.321
-We should probably get some sleep.
-Yeah.

02:40.285 --> 02:41.452
I love you.

02:42.829 --> 02:43.913
I love you too.

02:47.959 --> 02:50.128
[inhales slowly] All right.

02:50.211 --> 02:51.713
[Jack grunts]

02:59.554 --> 03:00.889
-[Jack] Night.
-Good night.

03:11.566 --> 03:13.568
[theme music playing]

03:24.829 --> 03:27.916
"Why, you're nothing
but a great big coward."

03:27.999 --> 03:30.418
I am a coward. I, uh…

03:31.211 --> 03:33.379
[inhales] Wait, what's my next line?

03:33.463 --> 03:35.924
"I haven't got any courage at all."

03:36.007 --> 03:38.801
"I haven't got any courage at all."

03:41.054 --> 03:42.597
"I even scare myself."

03:42.680 --> 03:45.141
-I can't do this.
-Oh, buddy, come on.

03:45.225 --> 03:48.603
You just gotta keep practicing.
You are gonna be great on stage.

03:48.686 --> 03:52.148
I'm gonna look stupid.
And everyone's gonna laugh at me.

03:52.815 --> 03:55.610
-The kids at camp giving you a hard time?
-Just Sam.

03:55.693 --> 03:57.362
But everyone thinks he's awesome.

03:57.445 --> 04:00.907
Hey. If he's hurting you,
you need to tell a grown-up.

04:00.990 --> 04:04.452
He's not hurting me.
He's just acting like a jerk.

04:04.535 --> 04:07.622
Okay, well,
then you gotta stand up for yourself.

04:07.705 --> 04:10.583
And how do I do that?

04:10.667 --> 04:13.253
The next time he is being mean,

04:13.962 --> 04:16.881
you look him straight in the eye,
and you say,

04:16.965 --> 04:18.800
"Psshh. Whatever, man."

04:18.883 --> 04:21.010
-Then you walk away.
-That'll work?

04:21.094 --> 04:23.263
[laughs] Oh, you betcha.

04:23.346 --> 04:24.764
And when I get home tonight,

04:24.847 --> 04:28.393
we will practice these lines
until you got 'em down pat.

04:29.185 --> 04:30.603
If you still wanna quit,

04:31.854 --> 04:33.022
well, you can.

04:33.106 --> 04:34.399
-[Christopher] Hm.
-Hm?

04:35.942 --> 04:37.860
-Whatever, man.
-Oh! Whatever, man!

04:37.944 --> 04:39.153
[Preacher laughs]

04:39.237 --> 04:40.655
[Connie] Okay, you two.

04:40.738 --> 04:42.573
-Playtime is over.
-Oh.

04:42.657 --> 04:45.910
Yeah, time to skedaddle,
or we're gonna be late for drop-off.

04:45.994 --> 04:48.538
-[Christopher] Race you to the car!
-[Connie] Woo-hoo!

04:48.621 --> 04:51.124
-Thanks for taking him this morning.
-Oh. [chuckles]

04:51.207 --> 04:54.877
Well, ever since Lizzie moved out,

04:54.961 --> 04:56.713
I've got extra time on my hands.

04:56.796 --> 04:59.757
-I appreciate your help with Christopher.
-Mm.

04:59.841 --> 05:02.885
Honey, when it comes to raising kids,

05:02.969 --> 05:05.596
I believe that it takes a village,

05:06.306 --> 05:08.266
and I'm more than happy to do my share.

05:09.267 --> 05:10.601
-Thanks again.
-Mm-hmm.

05:12.478 --> 05:13.521
[sighs softly]

05:17.942 --> 05:18.776
Hey.

05:20.028 --> 05:20.862
Morning.

05:20.945 --> 05:23.906
Is that a dark roast I smell?

05:23.990 --> 05:25.658
It is. I just made a fresh pot.

05:25.742 --> 05:28.578
-Oh, thank you.
-You're welcome.

05:31.414 --> 05:33.666
So have you, uh, talked to Hope today?

05:34.292 --> 05:36.461
No, no, I spoke to her last night.

05:37.045 --> 05:41.591
Power is spotty in Port Royal.
It's not easy to get in touch with her.

05:41.674 --> 05:44.177
Well, at least you know she's safe.

05:44.260 --> 05:45.178
[Doc] Yeah.

05:45.845 --> 05:48.848
I won't feel better
until she is back home.

05:49.640 --> 05:50.767
You miss her, don't you?

05:51.351 --> 05:53.895
Yes, I am looking forward to her return.

05:53.978 --> 05:57.106
I swear your heart grew three sizes
since you gave Hope a ring.

05:58.232 --> 06:00.693
Gosh! Now do we get
to discuss your love life?

06:01.778 --> 06:04.364
No. You're right. Let's not go into that.

06:04.447 --> 06:05.740
Agreed.

06:06.824 --> 06:07.992
Oh,

06:08.576 --> 06:13.664
by the way, I, uh, need for you
to cover for me this afternoon.

06:13.748 --> 06:16.709
Ah! Isn't that interesting?

06:16.793 --> 06:18.294
Not particularly.

06:18.378 --> 06:21.422
Well, you need something from me,
and I need something from you.

06:21.506 --> 06:24.384
And what do you need from me?

06:24.467 --> 06:26.803
To know why you're interviewing people.

06:26.886 --> 06:31.516
Well, technically, you don't really need
to know that information to do your job.

06:31.599 --> 06:34.185
If I'm not informed
on the inner workings of this office,

06:34.268 --> 06:36.354
then how can I be trusted
to cover for you?

06:36.938 --> 06:39.982
Look, I was planning on telling you,

06:40.066 --> 06:42.568
so this is not me just giving in.

06:42.652 --> 06:43.653
Uh-huh, okay.

06:45.696 --> 06:48.699
I am interviewing physicians.

06:49.826 --> 06:50.660
Why?

06:50.743 --> 06:53.371
Because I think
we could use the extra help.

06:53.454 --> 06:57.375
I mean, I don't think you're gonna be able
to handle another doctor.

06:57.458 --> 06:59.043
I mean, you barely tolerate me.

06:59.127 --> 07:02.004
That is not true.
I think we do quite well together.

07:02.630 --> 07:06.259
Uh-huh. That's only because
I am very accommodating.

07:06.342 --> 07:08.594
That's a misuse of the word "very."

07:08.678 --> 07:12.306
Oh, come on. You and I both know
the second another doctor comes in here

07:12.390 --> 07:15.685
and tries to change anything,
you're gonna have a fit.

07:16.644 --> 07:17.603
[sighs]

07:18.312 --> 07:20.022
I will have to adjust.

07:20.106 --> 07:23.568
Okay. Well, if you do decide
to hire someone,

07:23.651 --> 07:27.405
I don't think you're going to,
but if you do, it directly affects me too.

07:29.866 --> 07:35.496
I understand, and I'm sorry
I didn't recognize that from the start.

07:36.497 --> 07:37.415
Thank you.

07:39.000 --> 07:41.961
Look, I have another candidate
coming in later this morning,

07:42.044 --> 07:45.298
and if you would like,
we can do the interview together.

07:46.424 --> 07:48.759
I would love that.
That'd be great. Thank you.

07:49.719 --> 07:51.387
-[phone ringing]
-Oh. I'm sorry.

07:52.930 --> 07:55.016
Oh. You know what?
Do you mind if I take this?

07:55.600 --> 07:56.601
Go ahead, go ahead.

07:58.853 --> 08:00.563
[sighs]

08:00.646 --> 08:01.772
[Mel] Hey, Joe.

08:09.739 --> 08:12.241
-[Mike] Huh?
-Oh, you leave any in the river?

08:12.325 --> 08:14.494
[laughs] Yeah, a few.

08:14.577 --> 08:18.498
Um, hey, if you can clean 'em up for me,
I'll split my haul.

08:18.581 --> 08:21.292
-All right. You got yourself a deal.
-All right.

08:21.375 --> 08:24.670
Man, being on that river
with the sun coming up…

08:24.754 --> 08:27.798
[whoops]
…it just gets me through the day, man.

08:27.882 --> 08:30.218
Hey, next time you should come with me.

08:30.301 --> 08:31.385
Yeah, maybe.

08:34.096 --> 08:35.723
Okay, what's going on?

08:38.768 --> 08:39.602
What?

08:39.685 --> 08:42.271
Well, something's spinning around
that head of yours.

08:42.355 --> 08:44.941
Nah, it's just relationship stuff.

08:45.024 --> 08:48.444
Tell me now or tell me later,
'cause I'll get it out of you eventually.

08:49.737 --> 08:50.863
[sighs]

08:54.367 --> 08:56.327
Mel told me that she wants to have a baby.

08:57.745 --> 08:59.330
Well, how do you feel about it?

08:59.914 --> 09:01.123
[sighs softly]

09:02.124 --> 09:03.417
I love her, you know?

09:05.294 --> 09:07.421
And I don't wanna
disappoint her ever, but…

09:10.007 --> 09:12.969
I'm having a hard time
wrapping my head around having two kids,

09:13.052 --> 09:14.053
let alone three.

09:15.680 --> 09:18.307
I mean, the thought of it
literally gives me chest pains.

09:19.308 --> 09:23.854
Yeah, I… I don't know what to tell you.
You're… you're in a tough spot.

09:23.938 --> 09:27.775
[Mike] Um…
If you need anything, just, you know…

09:29.026 --> 09:30.069
Thanks.

09:30.152 --> 09:33.948
Oh, yeah, the second I saw his face,
I wanted to take it back.

09:34.031 --> 09:35.366
Well, what did he say?

09:35.449 --> 09:38.452
[Mel] He said he was glad I told him.

09:38.536 --> 09:40.246
-So, then it's fine?
-No, no.

09:40.329 --> 09:43.916
There's a difference between
"I'm glad you told me"

09:44.000 --> 09:47.461
and "I am so glad you told me,
because I feel the same way."

09:47.545 --> 09:50.339
-Well, he was probably just in shock.
-No, I don't know.

09:50.423 --> 09:52.633
I'm worried I scared him off.

09:52.717 --> 09:55.094
Jack doesn't strike me
as someone who scares easily.

09:55.177 --> 09:56.012
Think about it.

09:56.095 --> 09:58.014
He's having twins, his house burned down,

09:58.097 --> 10:00.933
and now his girlfriend says
she wants to have a baby?

10:01.934 --> 10:02.768
That's a lot.

10:02.852 --> 10:05.146
Oh, damn it.
You weren't supposed to agree with me.

10:05.229 --> 10:06.063
Sorry.

10:06.147 --> 10:08.816
-I gotta go. I'll call you later. Okay?
-Okay.

10:08.899 --> 10:10.109
-Love you.
-I love you too.

10:10.192 --> 10:11.319
[Mel] Okay, bye.

10:13.154 --> 10:14.322
[sighs]

10:17.617 --> 10:18.534
There you go.

10:22.288 --> 10:25.583
-[Lizzie] Hey, Lydie.
-Hello there. Did you have a good sleep?

10:25.666 --> 10:28.669
I did.
Thanks again for letting me stay with you.

10:28.753 --> 10:30.546
The shower in the guest bathroom rocks.

10:30.630 --> 10:34.133
Oh, you mean the bathroom?
There's only one.

10:35.092 --> 10:37.178
And I'm so happy you like it.

10:37.261 --> 10:39.597
-The water pressure's killer.
-Isn't it?

10:39.680 --> 10:44.852
I would've showered this morning,
but there wasn't any hot water left.

10:44.935 --> 10:46.771
Oh my gosh. I'm so sorry.

10:47.772 --> 10:50.066
It takes forever
to get the conditioner out.

10:50.149 --> 10:51.525
Yeah, I'm sure it does.

10:52.443 --> 10:56.572
So, um, what can I get you? It's my treat.

10:56.656 --> 10:59.450
Oh, that's awfully nice of you.

10:59.533 --> 11:03.204
Um, I would like, uh,

11:03.287 --> 11:07.708
a half a dozen gingersnaps
and a couple of oatmeal muffins.

11:10.127 --> 11:13.631
So, um, when do you think
you'll be going back to Connie's?

11:13.714 --> 11:16.008
We're not really speaking
to each other right now.

11:16.092 --> 11:19.637
Oh. But I'm sure
something could be done to make amends?

11:19.720 --> 11:22.515
I don't know. We're both really stubborn.

11:22.598 --> 11:26.185
But family is so important.

11:26.852 --> 11:30.940
Actually, I kind of feel like
you and Ricky are my family here.

11:32.316 --> 11:33.275
Is that weird?

11:34.902 --> 11:38.072
-No, it's a lovely sentiment.
-[Lizzie chuckles]

11:38.155 --> 11:39.323
[Lydie] Thank you.

11:46.163 --> 11:47.081
Hi!

11:56.507 --> 11:58.342
[cell phone chimes]

12:07.893 --> 12:08.894
[sent message tone]

12:15.151 --> 12:18.821
[cell phone ringing]

12:19.321 --> 12:20.156
Hello.

12:20.239 --> 12:21.532
-Miss Sheridan?
-Yes.

12:21.615 --> 12:23.409
This is Annie from Dr. Fisher's office.

12:23.492 --> 12:24.577
Hi.

12:24.660 --> 12:27.997
The doctor's refilled your Xanax
prescription for an additional 30 days.

12:28.748 --> 12:30.875
[relieved] Oh, thank you.

12:30.958 --> 12:33.627
You'll need an appointment
if you want another refill.

12:33.711 --> 12:36.130
-Okay.
-Where should I call in the prescription?

12:36.213 --> 12:39.049
Um, Dixon's Pharmacy over in Eureka.

12:39.133 --> 12:42.094
-Is that the same location as last time?
-Yes.

12:42.178 --> 12:46.807
-They should have it ready in a few hours.
-Thank you. And please thank Dr. Fisher.

12:47.475 --> 12:49.351
-Thanks.
-Okay.

12:51.187 --> 12:52.271
[sighs]

12:56.525 --> 12:57.359
[Charmaine] Hey.

12:57.943 --> 12:58.778
Char, what's up?

12:58.861 --> 13:00.362
I just came by to let you know

13:00.446 --> 13:03.491
that Todd booked
a luxury birthing suite for me.

13:03.574 --> 13:04.575
Oh, great.

13:04.658 --> 13:06.577
It's not great. It's incredible.

13:06.660 --> 13:08.954
I've got a personal chef

13:09.038 --> 13:12.500
and a dedicated photographer
who's gonna do my hair and my makeup.

13:12.583 --> 13:16.545
As long as the twins are looked after,
I don't really care about the rest of it.

13:16.629 --> 13:21.008
[sighs] Well,
Todd cares about me and the twins.

13:21.717 --> 13:23.719
All right, that's not what I meant. I--

13:24.845 --> 13:26.305
Sounds a little over the top,

13:26.388 --> 13:28.849
but if that's what
you and Todd wanna do, I'm cool.

13:28.933 --> 13:32.061
Look, Jack.
I know you have a problem with Todd,

13:32.144 --> 13:35.231
but we need to figure out a way
to work this out for the twins.

13:35.314 --> 13:37.316
I don't have a problem with Todd.

13:37.399 --> 13:42.321
Oh, okay. I'm glad that you feel that way
because he wants to have lunch with you.

13:42.404 --> 13:43.781
-When?
-Today.

13:43.864 --> 13:46.534
[scoffs] I can't today.
I got a private party coming in.

13:46.617 --> 13:49.161
Gotta be here for that.
The Lumberjack Games tomorrow.

13:49.245 --> 13:50.704
Can't you meet him for a drink?

13:50.788 --> 13:53.165
-Why doesn't he ask me himself?
-He's gonna call you.

13:53.249 --> 13:56.293
I thought it would be better
if I came and gave you a heads-up.

13:56.377 --> 13:58.546
-Well, I can't today. Sorry.
-[Charmaine sighs]

13:58.629 --> 14:02.800
Jack, if you refuse his invitation,
he's gonna be insulted.

14:02.883 --> 14:05.344
[scoffs] Okay,
I think I can live with that.

14:05.427 --> 14:09.223
Really? 'Cause it's just gonna
make things harder for you in the long run

14:09.306 --> 14:12.017
but, you know, it's…
it's totally your call.

14:16.814 --> 14:18.357
All right. Have him call me.

14:19.316 --> 14:20.150
Thank you.

14:21.318 --> 14:22.486
You got a new car?

14:22.570 --> 14:24.488
-[alarm beeps]
-Yeah. Isn't it cute?

14:24.572 --> 14:26.073
-[Jack] Mm.
-Todd got it for me.

14:27.616 --> 14:28.450
Super cute.

14:37.751 --> 14:40.546
-[chuckles]
-Preach, I got more supplies out back.

14:40.629 --> 14:41.881
-All right.
-I'll take that.

14:41.964 --> 14:43.465
Take the top one? Okay.

14:44.300 --> 14:46.218
What's the ETA on Curtis and the guys?

14:46.302 --> 14:50.681
Well, last I heard, they were heading over
to Big Lagoon, tracking a massive elk.

14:50.764 --> 14:52.725
Curtis says they should be in by lunch.

14:53.434 --> 14:54.435
All right, good.

14:55.144 --> 14:56.729
How big's the party this year?

14:56.812 --> 14:58.731
I'd say five, give or take.

14:58.814 --> 15:01.025
All right, well, I was thinking,

15:01.108 --> 15:04.361
these guys usually spend more on one meal
than we make in a week.

15:04.445 --> 15:07.156
Yeah! Ain't that the truth?

15:07.239 --> 15:10.534
And since you're the one
who brought in Curtis' business,

15:10.618 --> 15:14.663
it's only fair that you should take
50% of whatever we bring in.

15:16.081 --> 15:16.916
Huh.

15:18.375 --> 15:20.878
Oh, unless 50% is not enough?

15:20.961 --> 15:25.633
No. No, I'm just, uh, I'm surprised.
Doesn't that put you in a bind?

15:26.216 --> 15:28.385
No. No, the bar's having a solid month.

15:29.219 --> 15:30.304
Okay.

15:31.013 --> 15:35.142
And I think we should sit down
and talk about that partnership thing.

15:35.225 --> 15:37.603
Just map out what that might look like.

15:37.686 --> 15:40.564
Yeah, yeah,
if that's something you're open to.

15:41.231 --> 15:43.984
Yeah. I think it could be good
for the both of us.

15:50.908 --> 15:52.826
[Brady sighs]

15:52.910 --> 15:55.412
I was not expecting this.

15:55.496 --> 15:58.832
-[Brie] What did you expect?
-[Brady] That you wouldn't return my text.

15:58.916 --> 16:02.962
Yeah. Sorry about the other night.
I just had to get out of there.

16:03.045 --> 16:05.422
[inhales sharply]
It had nothing to do with you.

16:05.506 --> 16:08.884
Then I was… I was gonna call you,
and then it just felt awkward, and--

16:08.968 --> 16:09.802
[Brady] Hey.

16:10.386 --> 16:12.304
You don't need to explain yourself.

16:12.888 --> 16:14.473
It's cool. I'm just, uh…

16:15.307 --> 16:17.184
I'm glad we got together. [chuckles]

16:22.314 --> 16:24.692
Um, can I ask you a question?

16:25.275 --> 16:26.235
Shoot.

16:27.111 --> 16:31.657
I don't picture you
as the suit and tie kinda guy.

16:31.740 --> 16:34.284
Yeah. I had a meeting with a loan officer.

16:34.368 --> 16:36.870
It was for my company.

16:36.954 --> 16:38.580
Oh. How'd it go?

16:38.664 --> 16:40.541
[inhales] Not great.

16:40.624 --> 16:43.252
I have a bunch of trees
that can't be logged,

16:43.335 --> 16:46.046
so I need to make up for the loss.

16:46.130 --> 16:51.635
But apparently,
I don't have the capital to secure a loan.

16:51.719 --> 16:54.096
-What are you gonna do?
-I don't know.

16:54.179 --> 16:59.226
They said I should look for a co-signer,
but that's easier said than done.

17:00.019 --> 17:02.688
Well, if I had the money,
I would co-sign you.

17:03.188 --> 17:05.232
-You would?
-[chuckles] Yeah.

17:05.315 --> 17:07.234
And this is based off of what information?

17:07.317 --> 17:09.486
Well, I mean, you seem like a good guy.

17:09.570 --> 17:11.697
-Uh-huh.
-And you're very competent in bed.

17:11.780 --> 17:13.240
Whoa, back up.

17:13.323 --> 17:14.658
-"Competent"?
-[Brie laughs]

17:14.742 --> 17:17.036
Is that your attempt at a compliment?

17:17.119 --> 17:18.454
Okay, I'm sorry.

17:18.537 --> 17:21.040
How about, um, proficient?

17:21.123 --> 17:24.126
-Proficient?
-Or capable.

17:24.209 --> 17:26.420
And you have excellent abs.

17:27.129 --> 17:29.506
Remind me never to use you as a reference.

17:29.590 --> 17:30.799
[Brie chuckles]

17:41.977 --> 17:47.441
So, what made you choose,
uh, family medicine?

17:47.524 --> 17:49.234
My mom was a surgeon.

17:49.318 --> 17:52.863
I wanted to follow in her footsteps,
but I'm a people person.

17:52.946 --> 17:54.865
And, I mean, as you both know,

17:54.948 --> 17:57.743
when you're a surgeon,
your patients are mostly unconscious.

17:57.826 --> 17:58.869
[Doc chuckles]

18:00.662 --> 18:02.581
But I do have to ask you,

18:02.664 --> 18:06.627
why leave a prestigious post
at Johns Hopkins?

18:06.710 --> 18:09.296
I'm tired of assembly-line medicine.

18:10.005 --> 18:13.509
I wanna create
an intimate, holistic experience

18:13.592 --> 18:15.552
at an independently owned practice.

18:18.764 --> 18:20.390
Solid. Solid answer.

18:21.767 --> 18:22.768
[Doc sighs]

18:24.019 --> 18:26.688
Would you, uh, like to see the place?

18:26.772 --> 18:28.148
Very much so.

18:28.732 --> 18:31.193
Good.
Mel, you wanna show Dr. Hansen the clinic?

18:31.276 --> 18:33.779
Sounds good.
We can start in the exam room.

18:33.862 --> 18:35.030
-Okay.
-All right.

18:46.208 --> 18:47.334
[sighs softly]

18:50.796 --> 18:51.922
Awesome. Thank you.

18:55.926 --> 18:56.844
Hey, Grandma.

18:56.927 --> 18:59.388
Hey, I brought you a snack.

18:59.471 --> 19:02.307
Oh. Awesome. Thank you.
Did you see Lizzie?

19:02.391 --> 19:04.226
I did. We had a nice chat.

19:04.309 --> 19:05.561
Oh. What'd she say?

19:05.644 --> 19:07.604
That she's really enjoying our shower.

19:09.982 --> 19:12.568
Sorry. I know it's kind of a lot.

19:13.402 --> 19:16.572
I'm really happy to have her,
but only temporarily.

19:16.655 --> 19:19.366
Hm. Well, how temporary?

19:20.325 --> 19:24.413
I think you should talk to Lizzie.
Help her find a way back to Connie.

19:24.496 --> 19:25.998
Well, you could talk to her.

19:26.081 --> 19:27.332
Ricky… [sighs]

19:27.416 --> 19:30.002
…if you're gonna be
in an adult relationship,

19:30.085 --> 19:35.132
then you have to be able
to handle conflict like an adult.

19:38.260 --> 19:40.470
[sighs] So that's a no. Okay.

19:49.521 --> 19:50.355
Thanks.

19:52.566 --> 19:55.819
Hey, Allison.
Two usuals at my table, please. Thank you.

19:57.029 --> 19:59.156
So, Charmaine tells me
you're an ex-marine.

19:59.781 --> 20:00.782
No "ex".

20:01.533 --> 20:02.367
Huh?

20:02.951 --> 20:04.828
In the marines. There's no "ex".

20:04.912 --> 20:08.290
Oh. Like, uh, fraternities?

20:08.373 --> 20:09.875
I got you. Sorry about that.

20:10.542 --> 20:12.377
-Thanks.
-[Todd] Lagavulin.

20:13.003 --> 20:14.880
-Distiller's edition.
-[Jack] Ah.

20:14.963 --> 20:17.382
This scotch is
actually finished in sherry casks.

20:18.133 --> 20:19.468
Yeah, I'm aware.

20:19.551 --> 20:21.511
Oh, so you can appreciate a good scotch.

20:21.595 --> 20:25.015
Well, I own a bar,
so I've had my fair share.

20:25.098 --> 20:29.770
Well, collecting rare scotches
is actually a hobby of mine.

20:29.853 --> 20:33.982
In fact, I just bought
an 1824 M series single malt Macallan.

20:34.066 --> 20:35.984
-Guess what I paid for it?
-Four grand.

20:36.068 --> 20:38.487
-[Todd] Good guess.
-Well, it's not a guess.

20:39.571 --> 20:40.656
I'm impressed.

20:41.740 --> 20:42.616
[Todd] A toast.

20:43.533 --> 20:44.576
[Jack] To?

20:44.660 --> 20:45.535
To you.

20:46.036 --> 20:48.080
Becoming a father. Twice.

20:55.796 --> 20:58.799
Listen, I know Charmaine
pushed you to come.

20:59.967 --> 21:01.927
It's important to her that we get along.

21:03.553 --> 21:04.471
Actually,

21:05.389 --> 21:08.267
there's something I wanted to offer you,
face-to-face.

21:09.226 --> 21:10.102
All right.

21:11.812 --> 21:13.105
I want you to understand.

21:14.064 --> 21:17.442
I love Charmaine, and I would do anything
to make her happy.

21:17.526 --> 21:18.402
Well, I'm…

21:19.069 --> 21:22.030
-I'm sincerely happy for the both of you.
-That's good to hear.

21:22.531 --> 21:26.118
If I were you, I'd be relieved
she found someone to take care of her,

21:26.201 --> 21:27.577
so you don't have to.

21:27.661 --> 21:30.831
I'm perfectly capable
of supporting her and the twins.

21:30.914 --> 21:32.124
Yeah, I'm sure you are.

21:33.667 --> 21:35.377
But I'm offering you a free pass.

21:37.504 --> 21:42.384
Look, Charmaine and I talked about it,
and we both think it's best for everyone

21:42.467 --> 21:44.803
if I were to legally adopt the twins.

21:48.140 --> 21:49.516
I'm sorry, did you just--

21:51.268 --> 21:52.853
You say you wanna adopt my kids?

21:52.936 --> 21:56.481
Just hear me out. It's the cleanest way
for everyone involved.

21:57.316 --> 22:01.278
There's no dragging 'em back and forth.
No real dad versus stepdad.

22:01.361 --> 22:02.571
And I'll foot the bill.

22:03.613 --> 22:04.489
Hell,

22:05.157 --> 22:07.993
think of the cash you'll save
by not having to pay for college.

22:09.578 --> 22:10.620
Come on, man.

22:10.704 --> 22:12.122
It's a win-win.

22:13.081 --> 22:17.794
And you don't… think it would be
psychologically damaging for them

22:17.878 --> 22:20.213
to grow up wondering why I abandoned them?

22:21.340 --> 22:22.716
Not if we don't tell them.

22:25.510 --> 22:29.306
The fact that you would even consider
starting a relationship with my children

22:29.389 --> 22:30.349
by lying to them.

22:33.435 --> 22:36.688
Oh, and don't think for one second
that I would ever give them up

22:36.772 --> 22:38.231
for a little extra cash.

22:39.649 --> 22:40.901
They're not for sale.

22:42.361 --> 22:43.320
[mutters quietly]

22:50.410 --> 22:52.329
Thank you so much for coming in today.

22:52.412 --> 22:55.374
It was my pleasure.
I look forward to hearing from you both.

22:55.457 --> 22:56.458
Absolutely.

22:58.919 --> 22:59.920
[sighs]

23:07.010 --> 23:08.387
[door opens]

23:08.470 --> 23:11.681
So, what'd you think of Dr. Hansen?

23:11.765 --> 23:13.642
-Oh, I liked her.
-[Mel] Yeah?

23:14.684 --> 23:16.561
Even her holistic approach?

23:17.729 --> 23:21.483
Yeah, I think she'll be
a excellent doctor for Virgin River.

23:21.566 --> 23:23.402
Oh. Great.

23:23.485 --> 23:25.529
I mean, I completely agree.

23:26.863 --> 23:30.283
Well, if you do decide to hire her,
I just…

23:30.367 --> 23:33.995
I was thinking maybe you should
bring her in gradually.

23:34.079 --> 23:37.165
-Two, three times a week till--
-I don't think that's necessary.

23:38.166 --> 23:40.877
I think it would make
the transition smoother if she--

23:40.961 --> 23:43.130
[sighs] I just-- I can't do this anymore.

23:43.213 --> 23:45.090
What? I don't understand. You just--

23:45.173 --> 23:47.300
Please, no more questions.

23:47.384 --> 23:49.845
-Doc, what's going on?
-[sighs]

23:51.388 --> 23:52.806
I'm retiring.

23:52.889 --> 23:53.932
What?

23:57.269 --> 24:01.231
-Should I come back later?
-No, no. Uh, Bert, just follow me.

24:02.858 --> 24:06.695
-Is everything okay around here?
-Uh, yeah. It's business as usual.

24:15.996 --> 24:17.247
-Hey!
-Hi!

24:17.330 --> 24:19.458
Are you picking up
those pies Preacher ordered?

24:19.541 --> 24:22.544
Yeah. And, uh, I need to talk to you too.

24:22.627 --> 24:23.462
Okay.

24:23.545 --> 24:26.047
But if you're busy, I can come back later.

24:27.007 --> 24:29.426
-There's no one else here. [laughs]
-Right.

24:30.260 --> 24:32.721
Actually, I wanted to talk to you
about something,

24:32.804 --> 24:34.848
but I didn't wanna say anything
around Lydie.

24:34.931 --> 24:37.017
Oh, uh, okay. Go ahead.

24:39.144 --> 24:42.272
-You go first.
-[chuckles nervously] Okay, well…

24:43.273 --> 24:44.191
Um…

24:46.985 --> 24:51.698
I've been talking to my Grandma,
and she thinks… she thinks that--

24:51.781 --> 24:53.074
Just say it, weirdo.

24:54.993 --> 24:57.412
She thinks you should work things out
with Connie.

24:57.996 --> 24:59.498
She doesn't want me to stay?

24:59.581 --> 25:02.876
No, it's just that she thinks
that family is important--

25:02.959 --> 25:04.211
I get it.

25:04.294 --> 25:05.545
-Really?
-Uh-huh.

25:06.296 --> 25:08.048
I think we should get our own place.

25:08.924 --> 25:11.051
We… [chuckles nervously] …we should what?

25:11.134 --> 25:13.261
We could get an apartment,
maybe rent a house?

25:13.345 --> 25:16.056
A cute little cabin
with a big fireplace? [chuckles]

25:16.139 --> 25:18.058
I… I don't think I could do that.

25:18.141 --> 25:20.393
If it's about money,
my dad's still supporting me.

25:20.477 --> 25:23.188
And I've saved up
'cause there's nothing to do around here.

25:25.106 --> 25:28.151
Moving in together is a really big step.

25:28.735 --> 25:30.195
You don't wanna live with me?

25:31.071 --> 25:34.449
Like I said, it's a really big step.

25:34.533 --> 25:35.659
[bell dings]

25:37.118 --> 25:39.788
-You know what? Forget I said anything.
-Wait… [sighs]

25:49.089 --> 25:51.383
[Preacher] It's all fresh, and it's tasty.

25:54.302 --> 25:55.387
-[Preacher] Hey!
-Hey.

25:55.470 --> 25:56.680
Coconut curry soup?

25:56.763 --> 25:58.807
That sounds good. I'll take that to go.

25:58.890 --> 26:00.225
-Is Jack in--
-Yeah.

26:00.308 --> 26:01.184
Thanks.

26:08.316 --> 26:09.234
Hey.

26:09.985 --> 26:10.819
[groans]

26:10.902 --> 26:13.071
-[Jack] Uh-oh. What's wrong?
-Doc is retiring.

26:13.572 --> 26:14.823
-What?
-[Mel] Yeah.

26:15.490 --> 26:17.200
-Why would he do that?
-I don't know!

26:17.284 --> 26:19.035
Bert came in and interrupted us.

26:19.703 --> 26:24.124
I was just-- I literally had no idea
that he was even considering retiring.

26:25.417 --> 26:26.585
Maybe it's just talk.

26:26.668 --> 26:29.337
No! He's interviewing doctors
to replace him.

26:30.088 --> 26:31.089
[Jack] Oh.

26:31.172 --> 26:32.007
Yeah.

26:32.716 --> 26:34.342
Well, then, I guess he's serious.

26:35.176 --> 26:37.012
You know, it-- [inhales sharply]

26:37.095 --> 26:39.431
The fact that he's retiring
isn't the issue.

26:39.514 --> 26:42.642
It's that I thought
we had gotten close enough

26:42.726 --> 26:45.979
to talk about these things,
and I'm just, you know,

26:46.062 --> 26:48.356
I'm disappointed
that he doesn't feel the same way.

26:49.357 --> 26:52.777
I mean, look,
we both know Doc's a very private person.

26:52.861 --> 26:56.072
I'm sure this has nothing to do
with how he feels about you.

26:57.282 --> 26:58.158
Yeah.

26:59.451 --> 27:01.036
You're probably right. [groans]

27:01.119 --> 27:03.121
-You want me to talk to him?
-Oh God, no.

27:03.204 --> 27:04.706
No, don't say anything to him.

27:05.874 --> 27:07.876
No. I'm just-- [grunts]

27:07.959 --> 27:11.963
I'm gonna tell him he caught me off-guard,
and I want what's best for him.

27:15.216 --> 27:16.301
Thanks for your help.

27:16.885 --> 27:18.595
Well, I didn't really do anything.

27:18.678 --> 27:20.347
You let me talk it out.

27:23.058 --> 27:24.017
Oh, by the way,

27:24.100 --> 27:26.478
I'm gonna go out for drinks
with Brie after work.

27:26.561 --> 27:29.522
Oh. Well, good.
I'm glad you guys are getting along.

27:30.231 --> 27:31.066
Mm-hmm.

27:31.149 --> 27:33.693
Just call me if you guys need a ride home.

27:33.777 --> 27:35.028
Okay, great. Thanks.

27:35.695 --> 27:37.781
-Have fun with your party.
-Thank you.

27:58.385 --> 27:59.761
[horse whinnies]

28:12.565 --> 28:13.608
Hi.

28:13.692 --> 28:15.110
[locks click]

28:15.193 --> 28:16.444
Hey, Doc. Everything okay?

28:16.528 --> 28:19.447
-Yeah, I was in the neighborhood.
-Oh. Uh, just a sec.

28:20.782 --> 28:22.242
Just put Chloe down.

28:22.325 --> 28:23.785
Oh. She being fussy?

28:23.868 --> 28:24.994
Keeps me on my toes.

28:25.078 --> 28:26.204
[Doc chuckles]

28:26.287 --> 28:29.916
Uh, is this about Hope?
Please tell me she's okay.

28:29.999 --> 28:33.753
No, she's fine. I just wanted to drop by
and see how you were doing.

28:33.837 --> 28:36.005
-Oh.
-I haven't seen you in a while.

28:36.089 --> 28:38.258
We saw each other at Jack's yesterday.

28:38.341 --> 28:40.593
I meant at the clinic.

28:42.137 --> 28:45.890
Oh. Right.
Well, um, I've been really busy.

28:47.267 --> 28:49.436
I just figured
maybe we can make an appointment.

28:49.519 --> 28:53.314
It's been a while since you've had
your blood work done, and, you know…

28:53.982 --> 28:55.024
Did Mel tell you?

28:55.984 --> 28:56.818
About what?

28:57.527 --> 28:58.737
That I have cancer.

29:01.281 --> 29:02.449
You have cancer?

29:03.825 --> 29:07.036
-[Lilly] You didn't know that?
-No, I had no idea.

29:08.663 --> 29:11.958
Tara mentioned
that you had been feeling a little low.

29:12.959 --> 29:14.502
Now, tell me,

29:15.420 --> 29:16.880
what is the diagnosis?

29:20.175 --> 29:22.343
Pancreatic. Stage 4.

29:24.929 --> 29:26.431
I told Mel in confidence.

29:26.514 --> 29:27.932
No, I promise you.

29:28.016 --> 29:29.809
She never said a word.

29:30.643 --> 29:31.519
Okay.

29:32.979 --> 29:34.731
-Lilly, I'm so sorry.
-[sighs]

29:35.815 --> 29:39.277
Now, I assume you have an oncologist.

29:39.360 --> 29:40.820
Yeah. Over in Grace Valley.

29:40.904 --> 29:42.197
Okay. Now, who is it?

29:42.280 --> 29:45.950
If you're not happy, I have an in
at the MD Anderson Center--

29:46.034 --> 29:47.076
Actually, um,

29:48.328 --> 29:50.163
I'm choosing palliative care.

29:52.248 --> 29:55.293
I don't want the people I love
to have to watch me suffer.

29:55.376 --> 29:56.878
No, no, of course.

29:57.462 --> 30:00.715
But have you considered vaccine therapy?

30:01.299 --> 30:03.927
No, Doc. I have to do this my way.

30:06.095 --> 30:07.514
I can understand that.

30:07.597 --> 30:10.391
[Lilly breathes deeply]

30:12.060 --> 30:13.603
Lilly, I want you to know

30:15.021 --> 30:16.105
you're not alone.

30:16.189 --> 30:17.899
-Okay.
-Hope and I, we love you.

30:17.982 --> 30:21.820
Please don't say anything to Hope. Okay?
I don't want her to cut her trip short.

30:21.903 --> 30:25.365
Lilly, you're her best friend.
She'd wanna be here to help you.

30:25.448 --> 30:27.909
No, I think it's better
if I tell her myself!

30:28.618 --> 30:31.663
You know Hope.
She wouldn't want you to wait.

30:35.208 --> 30:37.877
[sobs] I'm just not ready for any of this.

30:38.628 --> 30:39.712
[sobs]

30:41.256 --> 30:45.635
[sobs uncontrollably]

30:45.718 --> 30:47.178
Oh, I'm so sorry.

30:48.304 --> 30:49.430
[Lilly sobs]

30:52.600 --> 30:54.936
-What time is it?
-Hm. After five.

30:55.019 --> 30:56.938
-[Brady sighs]
-Oh, I should go.

30:57.021 --> 30:58.690
Mel's meeting me at Jack's.

30:59.274 --> 31:01.234
Yeah. I'll, uh… [kisses]

31:01.317 --> 31:04.445
I can give you a ride.
Just give me a minute, huh?

31:33.141 --> 31:34.142
[Brie sighs]

31:34.767 --> 31:35.727
Hey.

31:37.103 --> 31:38.187
You're still in bed.

31:38.271 --> 31:42.734
Yeah, well, I was thinking
we still have some time, so…

31:43.318 --> 31:44.193
Uh-huh?

31:44.277 --> 31:45.820
If you're not too tired?

31:45.904 --> 31:47.238
Do I look too tired?

31:53.286 --> 31:56.456
-Wow! Look at this.
-[Preacher] Hey, you finally made it!

31:56.539 --> 31:57.790
Sorry we're late.

31:57.874 --> 32:00.001
-Don't worry about it. It's all good.
-Nice.

32:00.084 --> 32:01.836
What you got for us this time?

32:01.920 --> 32:04.380
-Man, we have got locally caught halibut.
-Nice.

32:04.464 --> 32:09.385
Fresh Dungeness crab. Plus the finest
Kobe beef from Hyōgo Prefecture.

32:09.469 --> 32:13.014
-Did you get the Chateau de Beaucastel?
-Yeah. I got a whole case in the back.

32:14.223 --> 32:16.309
Sounds like we're gonna be here all night.

32:16.392 --> 32:17.727
[men laugh]

32:17.810 --> 32:22.190
Yeah. So, hey, listen, fellas.
Let me get you started with some drinks.

32:22.273 --> 32:23.775
-All right? Okay.
-Thank you.

32:23.858 --> 32:24.734
[laughing]

32:24.817 --> 32:26.027
Love this place.

32:26.903 --> 32:27.737
It's perfect.

32:27.820 --> 32:30.740
[background chatter]

32:30.823 --> 32:32.492
[men laughing]

32:32.575 --> 32:33.409
[phone rings out]

32:34.035 --> 32:34.953
[phone ringing]

32:37.038 --> 32:41.292
[ringing continues]

32:45.004 --> 32:46.965
-[phone beeps]
-[laughter through phone]

32:47.048 --> 32:48.716
-Hello?
-[Preacher] Hey, Connie.

32:48.800 --> 32:50.969
-Can I talk to Christopher?
-Oh, yeah, sure.

32:51.928 --> 32:53.388
-It's for you.
-Oh.

32:54.931 --> 32:56.516
-Hello?
-Hey, buddy.

32:56.599 --> 33:00.019
Preach! I worked on my lines in the car
on the way back from camp.

33:00.103 --> 33:02.355
[chuckles] Oh, wow. That is awesome.

33:02.438 --> 33:03.690
When are you coming home?

33:03.773 --> 33:07.276
Yeah, it's, uh… Listen, it's gonna be a--
It's gonna be a late one.

33:07.360 --> 33:09.320
So, you know,
Connie's gonna put you to bed.

33:09.404 --> 33:11.280
But you said we'd practice tonight.

33:11.364 --> 33:14.867
Yeah, I know, and I am really sorry,
but I've got

33:14.951 --> 33:17.704
an important table,
and they came in late, so, it's just--

33:17.787 --> 33:18.830
You lied.

33:18.913 --> 33:22.000
Hey. Christopher. I didn't--

33:22.083 --> 33:23.126
I didn't lie.

33:23.960 --> 33:27.005
Sometimes things happen
that are out of our control.

33:28.673 --> 33:29.549
Christopher?

33:30.133 --> 33:31.009
What?

33:31.092 --> 33:32.719
You know I'd be home if I could.

33:33.928 --> 33:34.846
[phone beeps]

33:39.183 --> 33:41.060
[men laughing]

33:41.144 --> 33:42.061
[sighs]

33:42.145 --> 33:45.606
Honestly, it looked like it exploded,
like, right there. It was brutal.

33:46.816 --> 33:48.276
Promise me you won't tell Hope.

33:48.359 --> 33:51.571
Well, if that's what you want,
I will respect your wishes.

33:51.654 --> 33:52.488
Thank you.

33:52.572 --> 33:54.824
But, you know, with terminal illness,

33:55.950 --> 34:00.413
I think you…
you need to consider both sides.

34:00.496 --> 34:01.414
What do you mean?

34:02.415 --> 34:03.958
Look at it this way. I mean,

34:05.126 --> 34:07.920
you'll be giving the people you love time.

34:08.546 --> 34:12.842
Time to process your illness,
to express their feelings.

34:12.925 --> 34:15.845
-[car approaches]
-To say goodbye.

34:16.846 --> 34:18.973
So there will be no regrets after you go.

34:20.183 --> 34:21.017
God.

34:23.686 --> 34:25.021
Hey, Doc!

34:25.104 --> 34:26.105
Hey, Tara.

34:26.898 --> 34:29.609
Oh, you should stay for dinner.
We have plenty.

34:29.692 --> 34:30.902
I'll leave you two alone.

34:30.985 --> 34:33.154
I'd like you to stay
in case there's questions.

34:33.237 --> 34:35.323
Well, yeah. Do you wanna talk inside?

34:35.406 --> 34:37.241
[Lilly hesitates] I'll lose my nerve.

34:39.243 --> 34:40.161
What's wrong?

34:43.831 --> 34:45.416
[shakily] Uh, Tara…

34:46.250 --> 34:48.669
-Mom, what's going on?
-[Lilly] I--

34:52.006 --> 34:54.008
[sighs softly] I have cancer.

34:57.720 --> 34:59.263
[slowly] Okay. Uh…

35:01.015 --> 35:03.643
Well, how bad is it?

35:03.726 --> 35:05.812
Pancreatic. Stage 4.

35:07.647 --> 35:08.564
Oh.

35:10.858 --> 35:11.734
Um…

35:13.444 --> 35:14.320
Okay.

35:14.821 --> 35:17.698
Well, how soon can you start chemo?

35:18.491 --> 35:21.994
My illness is terminal. There's nothing
they can do for me at this point.

35:22.078 --> 35:23.663
No, there's something they can do.

35:24.372 --> 35:26.207
There's something they can do. Doc?

35:27.250 --> 35:28.251
A clinical trial?

35:29.752 --> 35:33.881
Pancreatic is one of
the more aggressive types of cancer.

35:33.965 --> 35:36.968
At this late stage, it's inoperable.

35:37.635 --> 35:41.556
And I just wanna spend whatever time
I have left with you and Chloe.

35:44.267 --> 35:45.643
But you look normal.

35:46.144 --> 35:48.062
I haven't been feeling that well lately.

35:48.146 --> 35:51.440
Yeah, but I thought
Chloe and I were tiring you out.

35:53.109 --> 35:54.277
[moans softly]

35:55.695 --> 35:57.613
-I should've done more.
-No, don't.

35:57.697 --> 36:00.283
-I should've helped more.
-Don't! This is not your fault.

36:00.366 --> 36:03.244
Oh my God.
I'm so sorry I'm putting you through this.

36:03.327 --> 36:04.620
[Tara sniffles]

36:04.704 --> 36:06.956
I'm sorry this is happening to you.

36:08.708 --> 36:11.210
Whatever you need,
I will take care of it, okay?

36:11.294 --> 36:12.253
[quietly] Oh God.

36:12.920 --> 36:16.465
I just-- I don't want you
to keep changing your life on my account.

36:16.549 --> 36:18.426
Oh, I don't care about me.

36:19.594 --> 36:21.012
I'm worried about you.

36:22.680 --> 36:24.223
I love you so much.

36:25.224 --> 36:28.019
I love you too, sweetheart. I'm so sorry.

36:29.562 --> 36:30.771
[Lilly] I'm so sorry.

36:30.855 --> 36:32.398
[Tara sniffles]

36:32.481 --> 36:33.733
[Lilly] It's okay.

36:33.816 --> 36:35.610
-[Tara cries]
-Yeah, it's okay.

36:35.693 --> 36:37.778
-[Tara sobs]
-Oh my God.

36:37.862 --> 36:39.739
-[Tara sobs]
-It's okay, baby.

37:02.386 --> 37:04.388
-[sighs]
-[cell phone ringing]

37:06.515 --> 37:08.267
-Hello, Julia.
-Hello.

37:08.351 --> 37:10.436
So how'd the interview go with Dr. Hansen?

37:10.519 --> 37:12.521
Uh, very, very well, thanks.

37:12.605 --> 37:13.648
-Yeah.
-That's great.

37:13.731 --> 37:17.318
She has another offer, but, lucky for you,
she wants to come to Virgin River.

37:17.401 --> 37:18.402
[Doc] Oh, I see.

37:18.486 --> 37:19.570
Um…

37:21.322 --> 37:22.531
Well… [sighs]

37:22.615 --> 37:25.201
…just give me some more time
to consider my options.

37:25.284 --> 37:28.996
Unfortunately, you're going to need
to decide by tomorrow,

37:29.080 --> 37:30.957
or you're gonna lose her.

37:31.040 --> 37:34.877
No, I can't.
I cannot make a decision that quickly.

37:34.961 --> 37:36.295
[Julia] I'm sorry, Vernon,

37:36.379 --> 37:39.340
but this case,
it requires a quick turnaround.

37:39.423 --> 37:40.675
[Julia] Goodbye, Vernon.

37:40.758 --> 37:41.801
[sighs]

37:44.845 --> 37:46.055
[sighs]

37:46.138 --> 37:47.431
More, more. [laughs]

37:47.515 --> 37:49.767
-I'll get you some more.
-You killed that one.

37:52.561 --> 37:54.730
They're eating food
faster than you can make it!

37:54.814 --> 37:58.567
Yeah, and drinking like fish. Lucky we got
another case of Beaucastel in the back.

37:58.651 --> 37:59.902
It's gonna be a hefty bill.

37:59.986 --> 38:01.696
Yeah, and they don't seem to care.

38:02.196 --> 38:04.615
-What are you gonna do with your share?
-I don't know.

38:04.699 --> 38:07.368
Thinking about taking Christopher
somewhere. Maybe Disneyland.

38:07.451 --> 38:08.744
Uh-huh, that'll be nice.

38:08.828 --> 38:12.039
Yeah, he's been having a tough time,
so he could use some good news.

38:12.123 --> 38:14.333
Well, how much longer till Paige is back?

38:15.835 --> 38:18.671
Hey, Doc. I got some fresh rainbow trout.

38:19.255 --> 38:21.090
-I'll take it.
-[Preacher] All right!

38:23.259 --> 38:24.135
Hey.

38:25.052 --> 38:26.178
[sighs]

38:28.472 --> 38:32.226
For someone on the brink of retirement,
you don't look too happy.

38:34.020 --> 38:34.854
What was that?

38:35.688 --> 38:36.897
I heard you're retiring.

38:39.275 --> 38:41.569
Yeah? Where'd you hear that?

38:42.403 --> 38:43.237
Mel.

38:43.779 --> 38:45.698
[Doc] Ah. I see.

38:46.657 --> 38:49.076
Well, for your information,

38:49.869 --> 38:51.162
that piece of news?

38:51.245 --> 38:53.622
That was given to her in confidence.

38:53.706 --> 38:56.459
Don't blame Mel.
She was hurt, and she wanted some advice.

38:56.542 --> 38:59.670
I don't care.
My business is a private matter.

38:59.754 --> 39:04.175
She had no right discussing this
with anyone, anyone, outside of my office.

39:04.258 --> 39:05.634
All right, be reasonable here.

39:05.718 --> 39:08.763
I'm sure this wasn't your intention,
but she felt sucker-punched.

39:08.846 --> 39:09.722
You know what?

39:09.805 --> 39:13.142
I didn't come here to get lectured
on how I should run my practice.

39:13.225 --> 39:16.937
And you just let Preacher know,
cancel my order.

39:19.440 --> 39:20.483
Hey. What's wrong?

39:20.566 --> 39:22.777
I don't know.
Why don't you ask your boyfriend?

39:23.986 --> 39:25.613
Whoa. What happened?

39:28.115 --> 39:28.949
Come here.

39:34.413 --> 39:36.957
I told him you're upset
he sprung his retirement on you.

39:37.041 --> 39:39.293
Oh God. I told you not to say anything.

39:39.377 --> 39:43.089
I know, but I protect the people I love.
I'm sorry.

39:44.715 --> 39:47.968
You're making it really hard for me
to stay mad at you right now.

39:48.052 --> 39:49.970
-Then don't be.
-Uh-uh.

39:51.305 --> 39:53.474
Fine, just don't say anything else to him.

39:53.557 --> 39:54.642
Okay. I won't.

39:55.601 --> 39:59.522
But just so you know, in the future,
if anybody ever hurts you in any way,

39:59.605 --> 40:01.190
I'm not gonna keep my mouth shut.

40:01.273 --> 40:03.109
-Jack.
-I'm sorry. It's who I am.

40:04.026 --> 40:07.571
Yes, I know that,
and as I have said on numerous occasions,

40:07.655 --> 40:09.782
I am a woman
who can fight her own battles.

40:09.865 --> 40:11.242
-I know.
-Okay?

40:12.076 --> 40:13.953
This is gonna be interesting, isn't it?

40:14.036 --> 40:14.954
Yes.

40:15.037 --> 40:16.580
[men laughing]

40:16.664 --> 40:17.915
[Mel chuckles]

40:17.998 --> 40:20.668
Well, lucky for you,
I can't go back and forth on this now

40:20.751 --> 40:22.086
'cause I gotta go get Brie.

40:22.628 --> 40:24.380
All right. I think she's upstairs.

40:24.463 --> 40:25.464
Okay.

40:25.548 --> 40:27.716
By the way, you look really beautiful.

40:27.800 --> 40:28.676
Thank you.

40:30.469 --> 40:33.139
-Hey, cancel Doc's fish, will ya?
-Copy that.

40:33.931 --> 40:35.141
Those guys still eating?

40:35.224 --> 40:37.685
Yeah. Curtis and the guys
want sandwiches for later.

40:38.269 --> 40:39.437
Throw one on for you?

40:39.520 --> 40:41.522
Oh man, that sounds really good.

40:41.605 --> 40:42.565
There you go.

40:55.828 --> 40:57.621
[tense music playing]

40:57.705 --> 41:00.458
[rapid heartbeat]

41:00.541 --> 41:04.086
[door creaking]

41:26.567 --> 41:27.443
[groans]

41:28.444 --> 41:29.612
[Mel] Hey, Brie?

41:29.695 --> 41:31.405
[knocking at door] It's Mel.

41:38.412 --> 41:41.916
[drowsily] Hi. Sorry.
I must've fallen asleep. [chuckles]

41:41.999 --> 41:43.501
-Oh.
-Come in.

41:43.584 --> 41:44.752
[Mel] Yeah, no problem.

41:46.420 --> 41:47.254
[Brie grunts]

41:47.922 --> 41:49.507
[Brie chuckles] Aw.

41:49.590 --> 41:50.591
What?

41:50.674 --> 41:54.178
Oh, nothing. I just haven't seen
a waterfall braid since Mandy.

41:54.261 --> 41:57.306
-Oh, who's Mandy?
-Jack's ex-wife. [chuckles]

42:00.059 --> 42:01.936
[Brie] Oh, you didn't know about her?

42:04.772 --> 42:05.689
No.

42:05.773 --> 42:07.733
-[Brie] Oh.
-No, I didn't. [sighs]

42:08.484 --> 42:12.988
I am so sorry. Jack is gonna kill me
when he finds out I told you.

42:13.072 --> 42:15.241
[hesitates] It's okay.
I won't say anything.

42:15.950 --> 42:17.952
[sighs] That would be great.

42:19.286 --> 42:20.287
[groans]

42:20.913 --> 42:21.789
[Brie whimpers]

42:22.581 --> 42:23.832
-Are you okay?
-Mm.

42:23.916 --> 42:25.125
We don't have to go out.

42:25.209 --> 42:26.627
Yeah, I'm fine. [chuckles]

42:27.336 --> 42:29.171
Okay, 'cause you look a little pale.

42:29.255 --> 42:31.423
-I'm ready. [chuckles]
-Okay.

42:31.507 --> 42:32.341
All right.

42:33.175 --> 42:35.553
Oh. You know what? I forgot my purse.

42:39.139 --> 42:40.307
Oh my God, Brie!

42:41.058 --> 42:42.935
Brie? Brie?

42:45.229 --> 42:46.397
Can you hear me?
