of guerrilla gardening.

09:52.600 --> 09:53.982
That's what they tell me.

09:53.983 --> 09:55.724
I think I'm one of the faces.

09:55.725 --> 09:58.558
I mean, mine just happen to be
real prominent right now.

09:58.559 --> 10:01.474
I'm just trying to save
other faces that look like mine.

10:01.475 --> 10:03.474
You started planting food
gardens right outside your home

10:03.475 --> 10:05.391
in Los Angeles
on city-owned land

10:05.392 --> 10:07.516
because you said
more dialysis centers

10:07.517 --> 10:09.267
were going up
than grocery stores.

10:09.268 --> 10:10.933
Well, actually,
you own the land,

10:10.934 --> 10:13.016
but the city has jurisdiction
over it,

10:13.017 --> 10:14.683
so I figured
if I own the land,

10:14.684 --> 10:16.975
I should be able to do
what I want with it.

10:16.976 --> 10:18.432
Yeah, I got into
a lot of trouble,

10:18.433 --> 10:20.432
you know, warrant issued
for my arrest

10:20.433 --> 10:22.849
'cause they didn't say anything
about the rancid mattresses

10:22.850 --> 10:24.975
or the toilets,
but you plant a carrot,

10:24.976 --> 10:26.432
and all hell breaks loose.

10:26.433 --> 10:28.808
So basically,
I got the law changed,

10:28.809 --> 10:31.058
so now you can grow food

10:31.059 --> 10:34.724
on the parkways

10:34.725 --> 10:37.599

like, "If kids grow kale",

10:37.600 --> 10:39.933

and "Drive-throughs are killing

10:39.934 --> 10:41.183
more people than drive-bys."

10:41.184 --> 10:42.849

and basically, it's genocide

10:56.850 --> 10:59.141
'cause you can't get any healthy
food in these neighborhoods.

10:59.142 --> 11:00.766
You can get alcohol,

11:00.767 --> 11:02.849
and you can get--you know,
there's a dialysis center

11:02.850 --> 11:05.808
or there's a doctor
waiting to amputate you,

11:05.809 --> 11:08.599
but you can't get any healthy
food, and it's by design,

11:08.600 --> 11:12.016
and we need to redesign
our neighborhoods ourselves.

11:12.017 --> 11:13.558
We need to empower ourselves.

11:13.559 --> 11:14.933
We live there,

11:14.934 --> 11:16.933
and that we stop waiting
for the guy on the white horse

11:16.934 --> 11:18.432
to come and save us.

11:18.433 --> 11:20.301
We are the guys
on the white horse.

11:22.559 --> 11:23.891
My guest is Ron Finley,

11:23.892 --> 11:25.641
and we're talking
about gangster gardening.

11:25.642 --> 11:29.225
We'll be right back.
- And we're clear.

11:29.226 --> 11:30.558
Thank you for doing our show.

11:30.559 --> 11:32.516
Thank you for having me
on the show,

11:32.517 --> 11:34.766
and I must say you're more
radiant in person

11:34.767 --> 11:36.724
than you are on TV.
- Oh, thank you.

11:36.725 --> 11:38.267
Mr. Finley, great show.

11:38.268 --> 11:39.599
Thank you.
- Very important.

11:39.600 --> 11:41.100
I appreciate you guys
getting the word out.

11:41.101 --> 11:42.633
Thank you.
- Of course.

11:43.976 --> 11:45.509
It was a great show.

11:48.101 --> 11:50.100
What? Say it. What?

11:50.101 --> 11:52.599
You need to dig deeper.

11:52.600 --> 11:54.267
Wh--where's the journalism?

11:54.268 --> 11:56.432
Okay, there is more
to good journalism

11:56.433 --> 11:58.599
than interrogating
people, Kara.

11:58.600 --> 12:00.432
Having Ron on the show
shed light on an issue

12:00.433 --> 12:02.183
that never gets attention.

12:02.184 --> 12:05.225
That is also good journalism.

12:05.226 --> 12:07.432
But the story
feels innocuous.

12:07.433 --> 12:08.516
How?

12:08.517 --> 12:09.849
Because it's not journalism,
Mary Jane.

12:09.850 --> 12:11.683
It's advocacy.

12:11.684 --> 12:13.849
Oh, okay,

12:13.850 --> 12:15.849
so I'm an advocate
because the guest is black?

12:15.850 --> 12:17.100
Oh.

12:17.101 --> 12:19.426
Funny you never mentioned this with
any other guests we've had on before.

12:19.433 --> 12:20.808
Oh, please, don't try that.

12:20.809 --> 12:23.808
You know that you
should have pushed harder.

12:23.809 --> 12:26.432
You could have asked him is
it delusional for him to think

12:26.433 --> 12:29.599
that gardening is gonna prevent
poverty and gang violence,

12:29.600 --> 12:30.891
or you could have said, "Hey",

12:30.892 --> 12:32.641
"what do you have to say
about these critics

12:32.642 --> 12:34.849
that claim you're doing
this for the limelight?"

12:34.850 --> 12:37.724
Or--or is organizing
these dig-ins,

12:37.725 --> 12:40.432
where they plant crops
in abandoned lots,

12:40.433 --> 12:41.975
could it be sending a message

12:41.976 --> 12:44.141
that he's encouraging people
across the state to--

12:44.142 --> 12:46.426
to break the law?

12:46.433 --> 12:48.849
You could have asked him
any of those questions,

12:48.850 --> 12:52.558
and you didn't.

12:52.559 --> 12:55.384
No, I didn't.

13:05.017 --> 13:07.016
(Barbara)
Cut straight to the chase, Paul.

13:07.017 --> 13:09.308
David pulling out of the deal
was just a minor setback.

13:09.309 --> 13:11.100
If David's out, then I'm out.

13:11.101 --> 13:12.308
It's not worth the risk.

13:12.309 --> 13:14.100
This is a small bump
in the road for us,

13:14.101 --> 13:16.267
but David was just one
of many angel investors

13:16.268 --> 13:19.426
that I could turn to.

13:19.433 --> 13:21.724
It's a firm no
on this one, Paul,

13:21.725 --> 13:26.225
but I may have something
that might pique your interest.

13:26.226 --> 13:29.100
There's a development
opportunity out in California.

13:29.101 --> 13:30.558
You may have heard
chatter of L.A.

13:30.559 --> 13:32.058
getting another
football team?

13:32.059 --> 13:34.891
Yes, I read there could be
a stadium built in downtown L.A.

13:34.892 --> 13:36.183
next to the Staples Center.

13:36.184 --> 13:37.808
It's gonna be in Englewood.

13:37.809 --> 13:39.683
The owner of
the St. Louis Rams

13:39.684 --> 13:42.432
just purchased 60 acres
of property,

13:42.433 --> 13:44.183
and my source
at the NFL tells me

13:44.184 --> 13:46.975
it's all for a new stadium.

13:46.976 --> 13:49.308
Unofficial, of course.

13:49.309 --> 13:53.308
Okay,
so how does this concern me?

13:53.309 --> 13:56.267
I want you to be my project
manager out in California.

13:56.268 --> 13:58.599
You'll put together a team
of like-minded agents

13:58.600 --> 14:00.808
and developers
from the community

14:00.809 --> 14:05.308
and oversee purchases
of foreclosed properties.

14:05.309 --> 14:06.641
Now, when you say
put together a team

14:06.642 --> 14:09.432
of like-minded agents
from the community,

14:09.433 --> 14:11.683
I suppose you mean
black people.

14:11.684 --> 14:13.225
With your face
in the forefront,

14:13.226 --> 14:17.141
we'll sell it as a story
of rebuilding the community,

14:17.142 --> 14:19.766
and who better than the son
of the first black COO

14:19.767 --> 14:23.432
of Vantage Airlines
to lead the charge?

14:23.433 --> 14:26.267
You have done your
research on my family.

14:26.268 --> 14:28.599
We wouldn't be talking
otherwise,

14:28.600 --> 14:32.432
but this isn't just
about your family name.

14:32.433 --> 14:35.558
You're a risk taker
just like I am.

14:35.559 --> 14:39.183
Most people don't have the balls
to go after what they want,

14:39.184 --> 14:43.426
but I can tell that you do.

14:43.433 --> 14:44.975
So what's the plan?

14:44.976 --> 14:49.058
We'll build exclusive
residences around the stadium.

14:49.059 --> 14:50.724
The real estate prices
will explode

14:50.725 --> 14:52.766
once the stadium
goes into production.

14:52.767 --> 14:54.641
And what kind of upside
are we talking about here?

14:54.642 --> 14:56.849
$25 million minimum,

14:56.850 --> 14:59.308
and that's just your cut.

14:59.309 --> 15:01.641
Once you put together
your team of buyers,

15:01.642 --> 15:04.058
you'll acquire properties
from public auction

15:04.059 --> 15:06.432
at the lowest price point

15:06.433 --> 15:08.516
so that we can maximize
our profits.

15:08.517 --> 15:10.766
And I can only do that
by making sure my team

15:10.767 --> 15:15.259
has the ability to drive
the price of the property down.

15:17.684 --> 15:20.516
We're talking bid rigging.

15:20.517 --> 15:23.432
Two companies in San Francisco
just went down for this.

15:23.433 --> 15:25.724
I can't do much with 25 mil
if I'm locked up for ten years.

15:25.725 --> 15:27.432
I'm not asking you
to break the law.

15:27.433 --> 15:29.808
I'm just asking you
to get it done.

15:29.809 --> 15:31.308
I think my offer's
a great incentive.

15:31.309 --> 15:33.016
And what if things
don't work out,

15:33.017 --> 15:34.308
if the location changes

15:34.309 --> 15:36.516
or L.A. doesn't get
another football team?

15:36.517 --> 15:39.474
Then I own a lot of property
in Englewood,

15:39.475 --> 15:42.683
and you get to live rent-free
in my Marina del Ray development

15:42.684 --> 15:46.432
with $2 million
over three years.

15:46.433 --> 15:48.432
Think about it
and get back to me.

15:48.433 --> 15:51.683
I've got to move quickly
on this opportunity.

15:51.684 --> 15:53.633
Okay.

16:13.017 --> 16:15.933
Hey, I'm going home.
- Oh, okay, cool.

16:15.934 --> 16:17.558
Um,

16:17.559 --> 16:19.683
I'll send over some story
areas in a couple hours.

16:19.684 --> 16:21.468
Okay.

16:22.684 --> 16:24.474
Fine.

16:24.475 --> 16:26.058
Why don't you come in
and talk to me so our business

16:26.059 --> 16:27.633
isn't out in the street?

16:45.184 --> 16:48.183
MJ,

16:48.184 --> 16:50.474
I feel like you've

16:50.475 --> 16:54.058
pushed me out
of something that was ours.

16:54.059 --> 16:58.141
No, I took the lead
in our direction,

16:58.142 --> 16:59.891
but, Kara, I heard you today,
and I--

16:59.892 --> 17:03.225
No, I mean, like,
when we met in New York,

17:03.226 --> 17:05.432
we just clicked, you know?

17:05.433 --> 17:06.848
We had the same dreams.

17:06.849 --> 17:08.058
It was like--

17:08.059 --> 17:11.099
it was just like
this perfect puzzle that fit,

17:11.101 --> 17:12.933
and yeah, we fought,

17:12.934 --> 17:15.141
but we made magic.

17:15.142 --> 17:17.183
We still make magic.

17:17.184 --> 17:18.641
I mean, yes, we fight.

17:18.642 --> 17:21.891
That's our process,
but it makes us both better.

17:21.892 --> 17:24.974
Yeah, but lately this fighting
thing is just--

17:24.976 --> 17:26.723
it's like Chinese
water torture,

17:26.724 --> 17:28.141
and I--

17:28.142 --> 17:29.975
I just can't do it anymore.

17:29.976 --> 17:32.267
Look, I--I want to stay
with this direction.

17:32.268 --> 17:34.683
We are holding our quarter-hour
rating numbers, so--

17:34.684 --> 17:37.516
It's not even about
the new stories.

17:37.517 --> 17:40.516
It's--I just really feel
like I have to go after

17:40.517 --> 17:41.933
what I want

17:41.934 --> 17:44.225
just like you're going
after what you want,

17:44.226 --> 17:46.267
and our friendship
is too important to me

17:46.268 --> 17:50.766
to let it completely
fall apart.

17:50.767 --> 17:54.633
I just feel like we're going
in two different directions.

17:56.600 --> 17:59.891
Are you quitting?

17:59.892 --> 18:02.474
Honestly,

if SNC is the right place

18:04.433 --> 18:06.516
for me anymore.

18:06.517 --> 18:08.766
Do you have another job offer
somewhere else?

18:08.767 --> 18:11.267
No, no, no, no.

18:11.268 --> 18:14.633
But I can't just wish
to be on network.

we can still be friends.

As an educator, you've really
been at the forefront

28:53.526 --> 28:54.941
Well, like what?

28:54.942 --> 28:56.108
Well, you know,
charter schools

28:56.109 --> 28:58.774
often get fewer
tax dollars per student

28:58.775 --> 29:01.858
than regular public schools,
but we work harder,

29:01.859 --> 29:03.525
and we get better results.

29:03.526 --> 29:05.983
We have smaller class sizes,

29:05.984 --> 29:09.024
so we tend to have
a more hands-on approach,

29:09.025 --> 29:12.316
from the teachers
to the students to the parents,

29:12.317 --> 29:15.108

better student achievement,

of breaking down

29:28.526 --> 29:30.732

of charter schools in a way

29:30.733 --> 29:33.066

out of the way,

29:38.733 --> 29:41.108
Well, it's interesting
that you mention politics,

29:41.109 --> 29:43.108

is published by a foundation

to lure back

to the GOP

30:05.900 --> 30:07.108

Is that a crime?

30:42.442 --> 30:43.983

30:43.984 --> 30:46.358
because the books were bought
with campaign monies.

30:46.359 --> 30:48.441

that your book tour is merely
