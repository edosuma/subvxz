WEBVTT

00:15.015 --> 00:17.583
I mean, how can I say no
to a custom porta-potty?

00:17.585 --> 00:21.186
Wow, dude,
this is amazing.

00:21.188 --> 00:23.789
If I just stick my face
in that and inhale,
will I be drunk?

00:23.791 --> 00:26.058
- Do it.
-  <i>We came from atlanta.</i>

00:26.060 --> 00:28.227
-  <i>We went up</i>
<i>to dragon's tail.</i>
<i>- What?</i>

00:28.229 --> 00:29.528
<i>We did blue ridge.</i>

00:29.530 --> 00:31.563
I've never seen
anything like it.

00:31.565 --> 00:33.032
We're all we got.

00:36.036 --> 00:38.337
I can't think
of anything that we did
that wasn't awesome.

01:10.170 --> 01:13.238
Reedus:
<i>My first time, I was 13.</i>

01:13.240 --> 01:15.240
<i>I borrowed my buddy's yz80,</i>

01:15.242 --> 01:17.443
<i>And I sped off to my</i>
<i>junior high school to show off.</i>

01:20.380 --> 01:22.114
<i>I was riding</i>
<i>a wheelie on a hill</i>

01:22.116 --> 01:25.117
<i>When, bam, I hit a bump,</i>
<i>went airborne,</i>

01:25.119 --> 01:27.820
<i>Flipped over backwards,</i>
<i>and came down hard.</i>

01:27.822 --> 01:31.256
<i>They took me to the hospital</i>
<i>and stitched up my knee.</i>

01:31.258 --> 01:35.094
<i>Soon as I was out, though,</i>
<i>I was back on that hill.</i>

01:35.096 --> 01:38.831
<i>Half hour later,</i>
<i>I was back in that hospital.</i>

01:38.833 --> 01:40.566
<i>That's the thing</i>
<i>about bikes.</i>

01:40.568 --> 01:43.335
<i>Once you start,</i>
<i>you just can't stop.</i>

01:43.337 --> 01:45.471
<i>They connect you</i>
<i>to the road.</i>

01:45.473 --> 01:47.406
<i>The road, that connects</i>
<i>you to everything else.</i>

01:49.577 --> 01:52.377
<i>It's that mentality</i>
<i>that draws riders</i>

01:52.379 --> 01:55.247
<i>From all around the country</i>
<i>to appalachia.</i>

01:57.218 --> 02:01.887
<i>And I can't believe</i>
<i>I've never found the time</i>
<i>to experience it.</i>

02:01.889 --> 02:04.123
<i>From atlanta,</i>
<i>I'm heading north</i>

02:04.125 --> 02:06.725
<i>Into some of the most</i>
<i>beautiful roads in the south.</i>

02:06.727 --> 02:09.661
<i>Along the way, I plan</i>
<i>on hitting the fontana dam,</i>

02:09.663 --> 02:12.397
<i>Riding the famous dragon,</i>

02:12.399 --> 02:14.133
<i>Then heading up</i>
<i>the blue ridge parkway</i>

02:14.135 --> 02:17.569
<i>All the way to asheville,</i>
<i>north carolina.</i>

02:17.571 --> 02:20.439
<i>I know some places</i>
<i>along the way that</i>
<i>specialize in bmws,</i>

02:20.441 --> 02:22.541
<i>Ducatis,</i>
<i>and vintage harleys.</i>

02:22.543 --> 02:25.277
<i>It's a mecca</i>
<i>for gearheads out there.</i>

02:29.916 --> 02:32.151
<i>I'm starting out</i>
<i>at brother moto,</i>

02:32.153 --> 02:34.486
<i>A cool motorcycle</i>
<i>co-op in east atlanta.</i>

02:34.488 --> 02:37.389
<i>First things first,</i>
<i>I had to pick up</i>
<i>my friend jason</i>

02:37.391 --> 02:38.924
<i>Who's gonna go</i>
<i>on the ride with me.</i>

02:38.926 --> 02:41.360
- Crazy bike right here.
- Yo!

02:41.362 --> 02:43.695
-  <i>Hey, what's up, man?</i>
<i>- What's up, bubba?</i>

02:43.697 --> 02:45.197
- Some coffee for you.
- Thanks, dude.

02:45.199 --> 02:46.498
Nice to see you, man.
Morning.

02:46.500 --> 02:48.500
- Doing all right?
- I'm good, dude.

02:48.502 --> 02:50.469
Reedus:
<i>Jason paul michaels</i>
<i>is a custom bike builder.</i>

02:50.471 --> 02:52.404
<i>By the time</i>
<i>he was seven years old,</i>

02:52.406 --> 02:54.540
<i>He was already modifying</i>
<i>his lawnmower-powered mini bike</i>

02:54.542 --> 02:56.175
<i>To increase the air intake.</i>

02:56.177 --> 02:58.243
<i>A kid after my own heart.</i>

02:58.245 --> 03:01.180
<i>He's a good friend who knows</i>
<i>these roads inside and out.</i>

03:01.182 --> 03:02.948
We're going up
to blue ridge parkway.

03:02.950 --> 03:04.750
I keep hearing stories
how awesome it is.

03:04.752 --> 03:07.519
Dude, it's stunning.
Like the vistas when
you're on the road,

03:07.521 --> 03:09.354
I mean,
it's just beautiful.

03:09.356 --> 03:11.490
Everywhere you look
it's just mountains
and the skyline.

03:11.492 --> 03:14.259
I mean, it's fantastic.
Have you ridden that yet?

03:14.261 --> 03:16.195
No, I've never
been up there at all.

03:16.197 --> 03:18.497
Va-va-va-vow.
Like guys will just blow
by you at 100 miles an hour.

03:18.499 --> 03:20.499
- It's insane.
- Really? Wow.

03:20.501 --> 03:23.602
I've heard that
gets crazy
when the sun goes down.

03:23.604 --> 03:26.705
A little bit of whiskey.
Maybe jumping through
some fire.

03:26.707 --> 03:28.674
- Like burnouts.
- Ruh-roh.

03:28.676 --> 03:30.676
- Should be good.
- Yeah, that sounds fun.

03:30.678 --> 03:32.344
Reedus:
Is this your ride
right here?

03:32.346 --> 03:34.513
Michaels:
Yeah, dude.
The motus.

03:34.515 --> 03:36.515
This thing is insane.

03:38.284 --> 03:40.986
They're made in the usa.
Alabama, to be specific.

03:40.988 --> 03:43.622
It's essentially like
an ls 350 chevrolet

03:43.624 --> 03:44.990
Minus four cylinders.

03:44.992 --> 03:47.326
So it's a chevy engine
chopped in half

03:47.328 --> 03:48.994
- And put in this motorcycle?
- Basically.

03:48.996 --> 03:51.230
- Wow, dude.
This is crazy.
- Yup.

03:51.232 --> 03:54.399
There's, like, over
800 patents just on
the motor alone.

03:54.401 --> 03:56.802
- Check this monster out.
- Yeah, dude, the confederate,
man.

03:56.804 --> 04:00.405
-  <i>The hellcat.</i>
<i>-</i>  <i>It's so pretty, this bike.</i>

04:00.407 --> 04:02.374
<i>And it's got so much</i>
<i>power behind it, too.</i>

04:02.376 --> 04:04.309
It's nimble, man.
I mean, look at that.

04:04.311 --> 04:06.545
They opened all the gears,
the cam, everything.

04:06.547 --> 04:08.847
The frame doesn't completely
cradle the engine.

04:08.849 --> 04:11.416
The engine actually becomes
part of the frame.

04:11.418 --> 04:14.653
This is full, ground up,
everything is original.

04:14.655 --> 04:16.722
- Very cool. Very cool.
- Show me your spot.

04:16.724 --> 04:19.024
- Brother moto.
- These guys are awesome.

04:19.026 --> 04:22.327
It's a co-op.
Let me get my coffee back.

04:22.329 --> 04:24.029
- Hey, that's mine.
- Oh, is that yours?

04:24.031 --> 04:27.432
Yeah.

04:27.434 --> 04:29.601
Michaels:
You can come in,
you can rent a space.

04:29.603 --> 04:32.738
Work on your bike.
It's just like a little hub.

04:32.740 --> 04:35.574
- Oh, there's cat.
Good to see you.
- Good to see you.

04:35.576 --> 04:37.876
- This is norman.
- Hi, nice to meet you.
I'm cat.

04:37.878 --> 04:39.878
- Norman, nice to meet you.
- Good to see you.

04:39.880 --> 04:41.847
- What's up? Hey, meg.
How are you?
- Nice to meet you.

04:41.849 --> 04:44.683
So these girls
are part of a club called
the lady fingers.

04:44.685 --> 04:47.419
- Like the donut.
- Yeah, like the donut.

04:47.421 --> 04:49.588
- Exactly like that.
- So we're going for a ride.

04:49.590 --> 04:51.757
We figured we'd start
at brother moto.

04:51.759 --> 04:53.859
What better way
to start a ride?

04:53.861 --> 04:57.296
Brother moto was started
by a couple of great guys,
jared and bobby,

04:57.298 --> 04:59.598
And it's a really awesome
motorcycle co-op.

04:59.600 --> 05:01.466
It's really kind
of brought together

05:01.468 --> 05:03.068
The motorcycle community
here, which is amazing.

05:03.070 --> 05:04.703
They're great guys.
Great place.

05:04.705 --> 05:06.438
Wow, tell me something--
what's this bike back here?

05:06.440 --> 05:07.906
This little monster.

05:07.908 --> 05:12.544
This-- this looks like
a little yamaha dirt shredder.

05:12.546 --> 05:14.446
Somebody had fun on that.
It's covered in mud.

05:14.448 --> 05:17.082
- This bmw is cool, too.
- Oh, sick.

05:17.084 --> 05:18.750
- Can I take
pictures in here?
- Yeah.

05:24.357 --> 05:27.726
Thanks for having us, yeah.
Yeah, it was a pleasure, yeah.

05:31.799 --> 05:34.433
Reedus:
<i>For me, riding is about</i>
<i>exploration,</i>

05:34.435 --> 05:37.536
<i>Adventure, and meeting</i>
<i>salt of the earth people.</i>

05:37.538 --> 05:39.638
<i>The folks at brother moto</i>
<i>are solid people</i>

05:39.640 --> 05:41.440
<i>Looking out</i>
<i>for their community.</i>

05:41.442 --> 05:43.809
<i>The perfect intro</i>
<i>to this trip.</i>

05:47.780 --> 05:50.349
Reedus:
<i>So I thought we'd head up</i>
<i>to ellijay, georgia.</i>

05:50.351 --> 05:52.351
<i>It's about 80 miles north.</i>

05:52.353 --> 05:54.653
Michaels:
<i>Whatever you say, man.</i>
<i>I'm just following you.</i>

05:54.655 --> 05:56.822
Reedus:
<i>First I want to hit up</i>
<i>apex cycle shop.</i>

05:56.824 --> 05:59.524
<i>They work on vintage bmws</i>
<i>and ducatis.</i>

05:59.526 --> 06:01.893
<i>- You ever been to this place?</i>
<i>- No, I've heard of it, though.</i>

06:06.366 --> 06:09.368
Reedus:
<i>Our first stop</i>
<i>is apex cycle shop--</i>

06:09.370 --> 06:13.472
<i>A legendary place</i>
<i>that specializes in vintage</i>
<i>bmws and ducatis</i>

06:13.474 --> 06:17.909
<i>Located in the foothills</i>
<i>of the blue ridge mountains.</i>

06:17.911 --> 06:20.846
<i>The coolest thing</i>
<i>about apex is it's totally</i>
<i>under the radar</i>

06:20.848 --> 06:22.814
<i>And all word of mouth.</i>

06:32.859 --> 06:34.793
- Hey, guys.
- Hey.

06:34.795 --> 06:36.962
- How are you?
- Good. Good.
Hi, I'm norman.

06:36.964 --> 06:38.797
- Hey, I'm rachel.
- Nice to meet you.

06:38.799 --> 06:41.166
- Nice to meet you, too.
- How you doing? Wes.

06:41.168 --> 06:43.535
Nice to meet you.
Come on in, fellas.

06:43.537 --> 06:45.837
- Wow.
- Holy crap.

06:45.839 --> 06:47.606
Look at this place, man.

06:47.608 --> 06:49.408
Rachel:
<i>This is the workshop.</i>

06:49.410 --> 06:51.176
<i>This is where we work</i>
<i>on these old bikes.</i>

06:51.178 --> 06:52.911
<i>Try to keep them</i>
<i>on the road.</i>

06:52.913 --> 06:54.546
Reedus:
Show us around.
What do you got?

06:54.548 --> 06:55.914
<i>What do you got?</i>
<i>What do you got?</i>

06:55.916 --> 06:58.517
-  <i>What year is this?</i>
<i>- Rachel:</i> <i>This is a '54.</i>

06:58.519 --> 07:01.486
- Rachel: <i>And that one's--</i>
<i>- wes:</i> <i>A '64 r69s.</i>

07:01.488 --> 07:02.854
Wow, they're so pretty.

07:02.856 --> 07:04.589
Wes:
<i>People freight them to us.</i>

07:04.591 --> 07:06.792
<i>We get bikes in from</i>
<i>all over the place.</i>

07:06.794 --> 07:09.494
It's restoration
or custom jobs.

07:09.496 --> 07:12.531
A lot of the old
stuff is repairs.
Broken gear boxes.

07:12.533 --> 07:15.200
Rachel: <i>We just</i>
<i>finished a pre-war bike.</i>
<i>That was pretty sweet.</i>

07:15.202 --> 07:17.436
- Wow.
- Heart of the machine
right there.

07:17.438 --> 07:19.704
Yeah, right there, man.
How long have you guys
been here?

07:19.706 --> 07:21.706
This spot since 2010.

07:21.708 --> 07:23.542
So we opened in 2002.

07:23.544 --> 07:25.844
We were down the street
out of my parents' garage.

07:25.846 --> 07:28.780
And why vintage bikes?
Why not the new bikes?

07:28.782 --> 07:30.782
- I don't know.
- They're fun to travel on.
It's an adventure.

07:30.784 --> 07:33.552
'cause you just, you know?
There's a soul.

07:33.554 --> 07:35.821
-  <i>It's, like, got that--</i>
<i>- rachel:</i> <i>They've got a story.</i>
<i>You can feel it.</i>

07:35.823 --> 07:37.722
That's my favorite.

07:37.724 --> 07:39.891
Did you guys have the same
mindset to end up here?

07:39.893 --> 07:41.626
This happened
so organically.

07:41.628 --> 07:42.861
People would just call
and say, you know,

07:42.863 --> 07:44.729
"are you still
working on beemers?"

07:44.731 --> 07:46.665
And next thing we knew,
we had more business,

07:46.667 --> 07:48.467
And we just-- we're like,
"we'll just stay."

07:48.469 --> 07:50.769
It's nice up here.
We're out of the rat race.

07:50.771 --> 07:52.771
It's quiet.
And we just can do
what we love.

07:52.773 --> 07:54.606
It's good.
No stop lights.

07:54.608 --> 07:55.941
I get it.
Trust me, I get it.

07:55.943 --> 07:58.243
You guys are
the cutest couple ever.

07:58.245 --> 07:59.778
Michaels:
Right? Right?

07:59.780 --> 08:02.714
- I want to be you.
- Aw.

08:02.716 --> 08:04.683
Reedus:
<i>Do you guys have kids?</i>

08:04.685 --> 08:07.052
Rachel:
<i>We have one. We have a son.</i>
<i>Seven years old.</i>

08:07.054 --> 08:08.019
- Reedus: <i>What's his name?</i>
<i>- Race.</i>

08:08.021 --> 08:09.988
Good name.
Good name.

08:09.990 --> 08:12.557
My name's norman.
Everyone's name
is cooler than mind.

08:12.559 --> 08:15.560
That's a good name.
Was it always just bmws?

08:15.562 --> 08:17.529
I grew up around them.
Everybody rode.

08:17.531 --> 08:20.031
My whole family.
My mom rode, my grandma
and grandpa.

08:20.033 --> 08:22.567
Watching my uncles race
and everyone.

08:22.569 --> 08:24.269
-  <i>Wow.</i>
<i>- How'd you get</i>
<i>into riding?</i>

08:24.271 --> 08:26.037
I had a friend
of mine in junior high

08:26.039 --> 08:29.274
That had a yz80
that I just kept
getting stitches on,

08:29.276 --> 08:31.910
And sort of got
into it that way.

08:31.912 --> 08:34.779
And, like, you know,
running from cops and killing
the engine in-between houses.

08:34.781 --> 08:36.781
- And that was kind of fun.
- Awesome.

08:36.783 --> 08:37.949
Let's go for a ride.
Let's do that.

08:37.951 --> 08:39.951
Wow.

08:39.953 --> 08:41.286
- Let's see.
- Mm-hmm.

08:41.288 --> 08:43.688
ooh!

08:43.690 --> 08:45.824
- Wes: There you go.
- Rachel: <i>Tickle 'em.</i>

08:45.826 --> 08:48.527
Cool. He's got it.
He's got it.

08:48.529 --> 08:50.629
- Now it's your turn, dude.
- Yeah, right.

08:50.631 --> 08:52.831
Wes:
Yeah, give it a kick.

08:53.900 --> 08:57.068
Almost.
Almost.

09:00.773 --> 09:02.541
Almost.

09:02.543 --> 09:05.043
Hey, I'll see
you later, norman.

09:05.045 --> 09:09.047
I'm coming.

09:09.049 --> 09:12.617
- Very cool.
- I feel like this one
likes me now.

09:16.155 --> 09:19.658
Michaels:
<i>Oh, man, what a feeling.</i>

09:22.061 --> 09:25.864
Dude, I'm riding
a motorcycle from 1954.

09:25.866 --> 09:28.867
Crazy, right?
And it's, like, perfect.

09:28.869 --> 09:30.802
It really puts you
back there, doesn't it?

09:30.804 --> 09:32.604
Yeah.

09:32.606 --> 09:33.939
Reedus:
<i>Both these bikes</i>
<i>are very cool</i>

09:33.941 --> 09:35.340
<i>And highly collectable.</i>

09:35.342 --> 09:39.744
<i>Jason's on rachel's</i>
<i>1954 bmw r51/3,</i>

09:39.746 --> 09:41.980
<i>The first postwar</i>
<i>twin cylinder allowed.</i>

09:41.982 --> 09:45.617
<i>I'm on a bmw r69s</i>
<i>with a rebuilt engine.</i>

09:45.619 --> 09:47.886
<i>From the factory in 1969,</i>

09:47.888 --> 09:50.221
<i>It was considered</i>
<i>the hot rod of its time.</i>

10:05.605 --> 10:07.606
Reedus:
<i>Sitting on this old bike,</i>
<i>I can imagine</i>

10:07.608 --> 10:10.642
<i>The original owner riding</i>
<i>the same road 50 years ago.</i>

10:14.013 --> 10:16.214
<i>The way wes and rachel</i>
<i>keep them running,</i>

10:16.216 --> 10:19.084
<i>The person who will be riding</i>
<i>this machine 50 years from now</i>

10:19.086 --> 10:21.186
<i>Hasn't even been born.</i>

10:23.990 --> 10:25.957
<i>Now it's time to sample</i>
<i>some local cuisine.</i>

10:25.959 --> 10:28.627
<i>In a word-- pies.</i>

10:28.629 --> 10:31.730
<i>But even better,</i>
<i>in two words-- fried pies.</i>

10:34.934 --> 10:37.002
Dude, how awesome
was that?

10:37.004 --> 10:38.937
That was great, dude.
That was great.

10:38.939 --> 10:42.107
I am so amazed
at how straight

10:42.109 --> 10:44.242
And true and smooth
these things are.

10:44.244 --> 10:46.077
- Rachel: <i>Aw.</i>
<i>- Like, I was about to get</i>
<i>up and surf it.</i>

10:46.079 --> 10:49.014
is this your local
pie place?

10:49.016 --> 10:51.850
- This is fried pies.
- After you.

10:51.852 --> 10:53.918
- Let's do it.
- Thank you. Thank you.

10:53.920 --> 10:55.754
Hi, what kind
of pie you got?

10:55.756 --> 10:57.088
We heard the pie
is awesome here.

10:57.090 --> 11:00.058
We have apple, peach,
cherry, strawberry,

11:00.060 --> 11:03.228
Blueberry,
coconut, chocolate,
and sugar-free apple.

11:03.230 --> 11:05.430
Say that again.
How-- that-- what?

11:05.432 --> 11:06.765
What's your favorite?

11:06.767 --> 11:08.133
My favorite
is coconut.

11:08.135 --> 11:09.768
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

11:09.770 --> 11:11.069
Let's get a coconut
and a cherry.

11:11.071 --> 11:12.103
- Coconut and a cherry.
- Yeah, yeah.

11:12.105 --> 11:13.972
All right.

11:17.209 --> 11:18.810
- All right.
- So what's in the pies?

11:18.812 --> 11:19.978
- There you go.
- What's in the pies?

11:19.980 --> 11:22.714
Just homemade goodness.

11:22.716 --> 11:25.116
- Yeah.
- I love that these
are "walker's fried pie."

11:25.118 --> 11:27.018
- Right?
- We call our zombies walkers.

11:27.020 --> 11:28.987
It's like they knew
you were coming.

11:28.989 --> 11:30.922
- Oh, man, this is awesome.
- Fried pie.

11:30.924 --> 11:32.457
- Mmm. Mmm.
- Wow.

11:32.459 --> 11:34.225
So where we
going next, bro?

11:34.227 --> 11:35.960
Reedus:
<i>Yeah, so we're going</i>
<i>to the dragon next.</i>

11:35.962 --> 11:37.996
Hopefully khaleesi will be
there, waiting for us.

11:37.998 --> 11:40.098
On a weekend?
No, don't go on a weekend.

11:40.100 --> 11:41.766
- So it's just super packed.
- Yeah, it's--

11:41.768 --> 11:43.702
If I only had a couple
days to run off,

11:43.704 --> 11:45.203
- I'd go to cherohala.
- Tell me about that.

11:45.205 --> 11:47.105
- Less populated.
- Peaceful, pretty ride.

11:47.107 --> 11:48.807
-  <i>Peaceful...</i>
<i>- You'll like it.</i>

11:48.809 --> 11:50.709
I would recommend
that if you're just gonna--

11:50.711 --> 11:52.110
- Oh, for sure.
- "cha-cha-holla."

11:52.112 --> 11:53.244
- Yeah.
- The cha-cha-holla.

11:53.246 --> 11:55.113
Cha-cha,
I like that name better.

11:55.115 --> 11:57.082
- What's it called again?
- Cherohala.

11:57.084 --> 11:58.850
You sure
we gotta switch now?

12:00.854 --> 12:02.887
Reedus:
<i>I'm sorry to say goodbye</i>
<i>to wes and rachel,</i>

12:02.889 --> 12:05.056
<i>But I feel great knowing</i>
<i>that there are enough ducatis</i>

12:05.058 --> 12:06.925
<i>And bmws in the area</i>
<i>to keep them busy.</i>

12:11.198 --> 12:13.932
Wow, it's beautiful here.

12:13.934 --> 12:17.068
I wanna do this forever.

12:17.070 --> 12:18.503
Reedus:
<i>The show runner</i>
<i>of "the walking dead"</i>

12:18.505 --> 12:21.973
<i>At the top of each season</i>
<i>to let us know</i>

12:21.975 --> 12:24.242
<i>What we can expect</i>
<i>and ask questions.</i>

12:24.244 --> 12:26.344
<i>Every season I've only</i>
<i>asked one question--</i>

12:26.346 --> 12:28.279
<i>"do I still get</i>
<i>to ride a motorcycle?"</i>

12:28.281 --> 12:30.248
<i>His answer, "yep."</i>

12:30.250 --> 12:33.084
<i>And I say,</i>
<i>"great. That's all</i>
<i>I need to know."</i>

12:33.086 --> 12:36.521
Hey, before we go to the dragon,
I want to hit up fontana dam.

12:36.523 --> 12:38.890
Whoo-hoo!
I can't wait to ride it.

12:40.326 --> 12:41.860
Stars and stripes!

12:45.065 --> 12:46.798
Man:
<i>...Really close.</i>

12:47.901 --> 12:50.535
- I just gotta ask.
- Keeps it from blowing up.

12:56.343 --> 12:58.009
Reedus:
<i>We've traveled two hours</i>
<i>north of atlanta,</i>

12:58.011 --> 12:59.911
<i>And covered about</i>
<i>100 miles of road.</i>

12:59.913 --> 13:01.813
<i>It's time to head</i>
<i>to this jaw-dropping place</i>

13:01.815 --> 13:03.815
<i>I heard about,</i>
<i>fontana dam.</i>

13:06.185 --> 13:10.855
<i>408 feet of steel</i>
<i>and concrete.</i>

13:10.857 --> 13:13.358
Reedus:
<i>At the start of world war ii,</i>
<i>the government needed</i>

13:13.360 --> 13:15.794
<i>An out-of-the-way</i>
<i>place to build airplanes.</i>

13:15.796 --> 13:19.130
<i>A lot of power to keep</i>
<i>the conveyor belts rolling</i>

13:19.132 --> 13:21.266
<i>And the lights on</i>
<i>for those workers.</i>

13:21.268 --> 13:23.067
<i>They chose this spot.</i>

13:23.069 --> 13:24.269
<i>The dam started construction</i>
<i>just three weeks</i>

13:24.271 --> 13:26.404
<i>After pearl harbor.</i>

13:29.909 --> 13:30.975
Michaels:
<i>Aw, here we are.</i>

13:30.977 --> 13:32.911
<i>We're coming up on it.</i>

13:32.913 --> 13:36.581
<i>Yeah, yeah,</i>
<i>yeah, yeah, yeah.</i>

13:36.583 --> 13:40.418
<i>Wow, dude, this is amazing!</i>

13:44.190 --> 13:47.158
Whoo!

13:50.296 --> 13:54.132
Reedus:
<i>That's an 11,000-acre</i>
<i>reservoir.</i>

13:54.134 --> 13:56.935
<i>240 miles of shoreline.</i>

13:56.937 --> 13:59.971
Michaels:
<i>Wow, we should stop and take</i>
<i>a picture. This is ridiculous.</i>

14:02.441 --> 14:04.375
I mean, we were
in downtown atlanta.

14:04.377 --> 14:07.278
- Traffic...
- Slamming coffee,
trying to wake up.

14:07.280 --> 14:08.413
Trying not to get hit.

14:08.415 --> 14:10.281
Throwing tons
of cat food in a bowl

14:10.283 --> 14:13.051
With my cat looking at me, like,
"where you going now, jerk?"

14:14.955 --> 14:17.222
You know, and now this.
It's a completely
different mindset.

14:17.224 --> 14:19.123
Jesus.

14:22.294 --> 14:23.995
I'm gonna do
a "pan-o-shot."

14:23.997 --> 14:25.029
"pan-o-ram-o"?

14:25.031 --> 14:26.965
Pan-o-ram-o, here we go.

14:26.967 --> 14:28.333
You don't mind I'm ripping
off your "pan-o-ram-o."

14:28.335 --> 14:32.003
No, dude, it's all good.
As long as you send me yours.

14:32.005 --> 14:35.874
Unless yours is better,
then send me yours.

14:35.876 --> 14:38.309
Reedus:
<i>I love solitude,</i>
<i>the open stretch of road</i>

14:38.311 --> 14:40.345
<i>And nature</i>
<i>all around me.</i>

14:40.347 --> 14:42.947
<i>That's when I want</i>
<i>to be on a bike the most.</i>

14:47.319 --> 14:50.989
Newsreel narrator:
<i>Atop the purple high country</i>
<i>of north carolina and tennessee</i>

14:50.991 --> 14:53.992
<i>Lies the great smoky mountains</i>
<i>national park.</i>

14:53.994 --> 14:56.361
<i>It is important that</i>
<i>the few essential roads</i>

14:56.363 --> 14:58.963
<i>Do not mar the park.</i>

14:58.965 --> 15:01.466
<i>Here's one through</i>
<i>famous newfound gap.</i>

15:07.006 --> 15:08.373
Michaels:
<i>I hate to kill your buzz,</i>

15:08.375 --> 15:10.408
<i>But we're almost</i>
<i>at the dragon's tail.</i>

15:10.410 --> 15:13.244
And it looks like
it's way too crowded already.

15:13.246 --> 15:15.980
No, it's cool.
Let's at least stop,
take a look.

15:15.982 --> 15:18.216
<i>From the dam,</i>
<i>it's about 25 minutes</i>

15:18.218 --> 15:19.918
<i>To a place</i>
<i>called deals gap,</i>

15:19.920 --> 15:22.153
<i>A combination motel,</i>
<i>restaurant, and store.</i>

15:22.155 --> 15:24.389
<i>It's at the end</i>
<i>of the dragon's tail.</i>

15:24.391 --> 15:28.459
<i>With more curves</i>
<i>than any 11-mile stretch</i>
<i>of road in the world,</i>

15:28.461 --> 15:30.161
<i>It's a biker's wet dream.</i>

15:32.398 --> 15:34.933
Oh, wow.

15:34.935 --> 15:38.336
<i>Unfortunately,</i>
<i>everyone's having the same</i>
<i>dream at the same time.</i>

15:38.338 --> 15:40.071
<i>So much for solitude.</i>

15:41.073 --> 15:43.241
Yeah!

15:43.243 --> 15:44.275
What's up, man?

15:44.277 --> 15:45.476
Hi, norman, nice to meet you.

15:45.478 --> 15:47.245
- Yeah.
- What's going on, ladies?

15:47.247 --> 15:48.713
Hi!

15:48.715 --> 15:50.415
I just gotta ask you,
what are you riding?

15:50.417 --> 15:52.483
Yeah, I'm riding this guy
right here, the confederate.

15:52.485 --> 15:54.419
Anybody ever tell you
you look like daryl
from "the walking dead?"

15:54.421 --> 15:55.520
- That's me.
-  <i>No way.</i>

15:55.522 --> 15:56.721
Yeah, I'm under here
somewhere.

15:56.723 --> 15:57.722
- Oh, my god.
- Yeah.

15:57.724 --> 15:59.157
Don't spoil it, dude.

15:59.159 --> 16:00.425
- Hi, how are you?
- How are you?

16:00.427 --> 16:01.459
What's your plan?

16:01.461 --> 16:03.061
So what's on
the itinerary?

16:03.063 --> 16:05.496
Making some runs
up and down the hill.

16:05.498 --> 16:09.267
And then we've got
fiddies 4 life races.

16:09.269 --> 16:10.735
- Fiddies 4 life?
- Tell me about that.

16:10.737 --> 16:12.737
Deals gap mini-bike
race series.

16:12.739 --> 16:14.172
So little pit bikes.

16:14.174 --> 16:15.506
They're wicked quick
little bikes.

16:15.508 --> 16:17.041
- Wow.
-  <i>Where do you race?</i>

16:17.043 --> 16:19.043
Right here
in the parking lot.

16:19.045 --> 16:21.379
- Like, right here?
- And we race all the way
to the end.

16:21.381 --> 16:22.981
Right around the gas pumps?

16:22.983 --> 16:24.482
Right-- right around
the gas pumps.

16:24.484 --> 16:25.550
That sounds super safe.

16:25.552 --> 16:27.151
How safe is that, yeah?

16:27.153 --> 16:28.386
You guys should
definitely come watch.

16:28.388 --> 16:29.754
- Yeah.
- Dude, check that out.

16:29.756 --> 16:32.757
Oh, look at that camaro.
Sick.

16:32.759 --> 16:34.525
Smokey and the bandit.

16:34.527 --> 16:36.094
Smokey and the bandit.

16:38.398 --> 16:40.064
Michaels:
<i>Yeah, that's awesome.</i>

16:40.066 --> 16:41.466
- You go by rhino?
- Yup, I'm rhino.

16:41.468 --> 16:43.468
Oh, my god!

16:43.470 --> 16:46.204
It's got 27" slicks on it.

16:46.206 --> 16:48.473
- Used to pop wheelies
on those all the time.
-  <i>I can ride wheelies on 'em.</i>

16:48.475 --> 16:49.774
I could be a good zombie.

16:49.776 --> 16:51.175
Yeah, I'd shoot you
with a crossbow.

16:51.177 --> 16:53.144
Before you shoot me
with a crossbow,

16:53.146 --> 16:54.412
Let me make sure
I can bite into
a good-looking woman.

16:54.414 --> 16:55.446
You gotta be a zombie
doing a wheelie.

16:55.448 --> 16:56.781
There you go!

16:56.783 --> 16:57.782
So what are you riding
out here?

16:57.784 --> 16:59.350
I got two... Over there.

16:59.352 --> 17:01.486
You gotta have a backup bike
to come here just in case

17:01.488 --> 17:03.021
Something happens, so...

17:03.023 --> 17:04.188
You're hardcore.

17:04.190 --> 17:05.490
What you do
to your arm, dude?

17:05.492 --> 17:07.358
- Motorcycle accent.
- Oh, man. Really?

17:07.360 --> 17:08.393
I'm permanently like this.

17:08.395 --> 17:10.294
So you ride
one-- one handed.

17:10.296 --> 17:13.264
So you got your throttle
and your front brake here?

17:13.266 --> 17:14.599
Is that right?

17:14.601 --> 17:16.167
Throttle, front brake,
and then an automatic clutch.

17:16.169 --> 17:18.069
I mean, I love riding.
It's my passion.

17:18.071 --> 17:20.338
That's one of the things
I won't stop doing at all.

17:20.340 --> 17:23.341
- Good for you, man.
- Watch rhino, right here.

17:27.380 --> 17:30.515
Reedus:
<i>I love this place.</i>
<i>It has an amazing energy.</i>

17:30.517 --> 17:32.617
<i>It's just too packed</i>
<i>to ride the dragon</i>
<i>on the weekend.</i>

17:32.619 --> 17:34.452
<i>The last thing I need</i>
<i>is for parts</i>

17:34.454 --> 17:36.421
<i>Of our one-of-a-kind</i>
<i>bikes to end up on a branch</i>

17:36.423 --> 17:39.057
<i>Of what the locals call</i>
<i>the tree of shame.</i>

17:42.061 --> 17:43.528
<i>And no way in hell</i>
<i>was I gonna miss</i>

17:43.530 --> 17:45.463
<i>The parking lot races</i>
<i>we heard about.</i>

17:45.465 --> 17:47.565
Ladies and gentlemen,
you're here for the main
event right here

17:47.567 --> 17:50.301
<i>At the one and only deals gap</i>
<i>motorcycle resort.</i>

17:55.074 --> 17:56.474
Reedus:
<i>I feel like a dog</i>
<i>watching someone eat</i>

17:56.476 --> 17:59.377
<i>A very small</i>
<i>but very juicy steak.</i>

17:59.379 --> 18:01.112
<i>It's so close,</i>
<i>I can taste it.</i>

18:05.385 --> 18:07.251
<i>That was crazy.</i>

18:07.253 --> 18:08.653
<i>If I were back in</i>
<i>junior high school right now,</i>

18:08.655 --> 18:10.621
<i>I'd be about an hour</i>
<i>away from more stitches.</i>

18:10.623 --> 18:14.092
You guys look badass.
Badass.

18:14.094 --> 18:15.126
But how did you get
into this in particular?

18:15.128 --> 18:17.161
A couple guys worked here.

18:17.163 --> 18:18.629
Some guy showed up,
said, "my bike's faster
than your bike."

18:18.631 --> 18:19.864
Here we are.

18:19.866 --> 18:21.399
<i>Like, a little 50cc.</i>

18:21.401 --> 18:23.634
I think judd's was actually
a kid's bike,

18:23.636 --> 18:25.636
And then it's bored out
to an 88cc.

18:25.638 --> 18:27.105
Emcee:
<i>All right, guys,</i>
<i>I just found out--</i>

18:27.107 --> 18:28.473
Reedus:
<i>You guys ever battle?</i>

18:28.475 --> 18:30.208
I made the mistake one time
of knocking the wife down.

18:30.210 --> 18:31.476
Oh!

18:31.478 --> 18:32.643
How dare you?

18:32.645 --> 18:34.378
I slept on the couch
for a month.

18:47.526 --> 18:49.260
There's no gas in those gas
pumps, are there?

18:49.262 --> 18:50.394
Oh, no, it's in there.

18:54.467 --> 18:56.400
- God!
- What?

18:56.402 --> 18:58.269
Reedus:
<i>Are they racing</i>
<i>for a prize or something?</i>

18:58.271 --> 18:59.637
Just to be number one.

18:59.639 --> 19:01.506
Bragging rights, yeah.

19:01.508 --> 19:03.274
Man:
<i>You ain't first, you're last.</i>

19:03.276 --> 19:05.243
Reedus:
<i>If I learned</i>
<i>one thing tonight--</i>

19:05.245 --> 19:07.278
<i>The smallest thing can become</i>
<i>the biggest adventure</i>

19:07.280 --> 19:08.312
<i>In the right hands.</i>

19:12.451 --> 19:13.751
Really close to my head.

19:13.753 --> 19:15.520
you know what I mean?

19:15.522 --> 19:17.688
Maybe I should step back
a little bit.

19:21.560 --> 19:23.327
That's crazy.

19:23.329 --> 19:24.529
- Eat my dust, norman!
- Whoo!

19:24.531 --> 19:26.464
All right,
hit it, lets do it!

19:29.935 --> 19:31.736
Can I reach
his balls from here?

19:41.214 --> 19:46.417
- Michaels: <i>Really?</i>
<i>-</i>  <i>Yeah.</i>

19:46.419 --> 19:48.486
Sure.

19:50.690 --> 19:51.722
- You can ride this one!
- All right.

19:51.724 --> 19:54.325
All right, dude, let's go!

19:57.563 --> 19:58.663
Reedus:
<i>It's day two.</i>

19:58.665 --> 20:01.199
<i>Last night, that was crazy.</i>

20:01.201 --> 20:02.667
<i>Things kept going</i>
<i>long after we tucked</i>
<i>the cameraman into bed.</i>

20:02.669 --> 20:05.336
<i>Today,</i>
<i>expectations are high.</i>

20:05.338 --> 20:10.608
<i>It's just 70 miles</i>
<i>to the beautiful and historic</i>
<i>blue ridge parkway.</i>

20:10.610 --> 20:12.510
<i>I love this motorcycle.</i>

20:12.512 --> 20:14.745
It's awesome, man.
You could go forever
on that thing.

20:18.718 --> 20:20.685
It wants to wander
a little bit.

20:20.687 --> 20:23.221
Yeah, I feel like it's
some pony I need to break.

20:23.223 --> 20:26.390
Michaels:
<i>Yeah, there you go.</i>
<i>There you go.</i>

20:26.392 --> 20:29.660
<i>Kind of a wimpy little horn</i>
<i>for that macho vibe</i>

20:29.662 --> 20:30.661
<i>You got there, bro.</i>

20:35.234 --> 20:38.002
<i>I'm gonna try to catch</i>
<i>a butterfly in my mouth</i>
<i>during this stretch.</i>

20:38.004 --> 20:39.737
<i>Be like mr. Miyagi</i>
<i>with a fly.</i>

20:39.739 --> 20:41.539
I'm just gonna do it
with a butterfly in my mouth.

20:46.713 --> 20:48.546
Man, it's starting
to rain pretty hard.

20:48.548 --> 20:51.382
We should probably
stop somewhere.

20:51.384 --> 20:53.451
There's a dairy queen
three miles on the left.

20:53.453 --> 20:55.519
Reedus:
<i>Let's just stop here</i>
<i>and dry off.</i>

20:57.656 --> 21:00.458
Ice cream would have
been a better idea.

21:06.765 --> 21:08.866
I wonder what
this place is anyhow.

21:11.536 --> 21:13.371
Holy crap.

21:13.373 --> 21:14.772
Yeah, let's go look
around this place
while we're here.

21:14.774 --> 21:16.540
- Yeah.
- Let's see what
all this stuff is.

21:16.542 --> 21:17.675
This door's too good.

21:17.677 --> 21:19.443
I gotta take
a picture with it.

21:19.445 --> 21:22.046
Oh, this is properly
destroyed.

21:22.048 --> 21:24.649
Pretty awesome.

21:24.651 --> 21:26.484
stars and stripes.

21:28.420 --> 21:29.754
Reedus:
<i>People sometimes ask me,</i>

21:29.756 --> 21:31.289
<i>"how can you stand</i>
<i>riding in the cold,</i>

21:31.291 --> 21:32.456
<i>When it's wet?"</i>

21:32.458 --> 21:33.591
<i>But that's</i>
<i>all part of it.</i>

21:33.593 --> 21:36.494
<i>And you're hot</i>
<i>when it's hot.</i>

21:36.496 --> 21:38.796
<i>But you're alive</i>
<i>and you're there in the moment.</i>

21:38.798 --> 21:40.564
<i>If the weather gets</i>
<i>to be too much,</i>

21:40.566 --> 21:42.767
<i>You just stop</i>
<i>and discover some new place.</i>

21:42.769 --> 21:46.537
Great smoky mountains
national park, cherokee!

21:46.539 --> 21:48.506
<i>Three quarters of a mile.</i>

21:48.508 --> 21:54.812
<i>But what I didn't know is what</i>
<i>we'd find when we got there.</i>

21:54.814 --> 21:56.714
It's right there!

22:01.787 --> 22:03.354
That is awesome.

22:03.356 --> 22:04.622
- Check that thing out.
- Take a picture.

22:04.624 --> 22:07.591
I've never felt
so emasculated in my life.

22:07.593 --> 22:08.926
Here, let me take a picture
in front of that.

22:08.928 --> 22:11.329
It's too good.
One, two, three, four.

22:11.331 --> 22:13.898
- Here, let me get yours.
- Gimmie, gimmie, gimmie.

22:13.900 --> 22:16.801
Ha, this is totally nuts.
Dude, you're so tiny.

22:16.803 --> 22:18.469
I've heard that before.

22:18.471 --> 22:21.505
Can I reach his balls
from here?

22:21.507 --> 22:22.707
Oh, it's "push."

22:22.709 --> 22:24.675
Oh, wow, hey!

22:24.677 --> 22:26.377
What's going on, guys?

22:26.379 --> 22:28.346
What's the story with
the statue out front?

22:28.348 --> 22:31.816
Back in the '50s,
there were a row of indian
statues in an airport

22:31.818 --> 22:33.617
Down in south florida.

22:33.619 --> 22:37.755
About 1961,
they sold off
and closed that airport.

22:37.757 --> 22:40.391
And this is one
of the last surviving ones.

22:40.393 --> 22:42.560
- Roadside attraction stuff.
- There was, like, a big--

22:42.562 --> 22:44.729
Wasn't there a texaco sign
with a big dude?

22:44.731 --> 22:46.664
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- And then there was the big,

22:46.666 --> 22:47.832
- Like, paul the bunyan guy.
- Yeah.

22:47.834 --> 22:49.667
Paul the bunyan guy.
It's paul bunyan.

22:49.669 --> 22:51.469
- Paul bunyan.
- Paul the bunyan guy.

22:51.471 --> 22:53.838
Reedus:
<i>Do you ever do tattoos</i>
<i>of the indian?</i>

22:53.840 --> 22:55.139
I've done a lot
of indian tattoos.

22:55.141 --> 22:57.541
I've been tattooing
for 31 years now.

22:57.543 --> 22:59.777
- We've done quite a bit
of different ones.
- Oh, cool.

22:59.779 --> 23:01.679
Michaels:
<i>So you have tons</i>
<i>of motorcycle riders</i>

23:01.681 --> 23:02.880
<i>Come through here?</i>
<i>You must.</i>

23:02.882 --> 23:04.682
Robin:
<i>Yes, the smoky mountains</i>

23:04.684 --> 23:07.451
Are some of the best riding
scenery that you can find.

23:07.453 --> 23:08.686
If you look
in the mountains,

23:08.688 --> 23:11.655
You'll see this
really pretty shrubbery

23:11.657 --> 23:14.658
That's called mountain laurel,
and it grows real thick.

23:14.660 --> 23:16.460
It just,
like, ties into knots.

23:16.462 --> 23:18.529
During their removal,
during the trail of tears...

23:18.531 --> 23:20.865
- Okay, yeah.
- As they were being gathered up

23:20.867 --> 23:23.701
And stockaded
and moved to oklahoma,

23:23.703 --> 23:25.436
The indians would
go in there and hide.

23:25.438 --> 23:28.706
- Wow.
- And the cherokee here
are all descendants

23:28.708 --> 23:30.541
Of the ones that hid
in the mountains.

23:30.543 --> 23:31.709
Oh, wow.

23:31.711 --> 23:33.444
Thank you so much
for having us.

23:33.446 --> 23:34.712
- Yeah.
- The history lesson.

23:34.714 --> 23:35.846
- Thanks for coming in.
- That was amazing.

23:35.848 --> 23:37.481
Thank you very much.

23:39.985 --> 23:42.553
Reedus:
<i>Not long ago,</i>
<i>this entire area</i>

23:42.555 --> 23:44.889
<i>Was cherokee hunting ground.</i>

23:44.891 --> 23:47.625
<i>It's heartening to think</i>
<i>of those who had the tenacity</i>

23:47.627 --> 23:49.927
<i>And bravery to stay behind</i>
<i>and fight for freedom</i>

23:49.929 --> 23:51.729
<i>When everything</i>
<i>was against them.</i>

23:53.432 --> 23:56.534
<i>That's what the road is.</i>
<i>Freedom.</i>

23:56.536 --> 24:00.504
<i>We appreciate its pleasures,</i>
<i>but we remember its costs.</i>

24:00.506 --> 24:03.207
Dude, I eat ice cream,
like, almost every night.

24:03.209 --> 24:04.442
But don't tell anyone.

24:06.211 --> 24:07.445
I'm telling everyone.

24:07.447 --> 24:08.679
<i>"let's ride" playing</i>

24:08.681 --> 24:11.449
<i>♪ hey, little mama...</i>

24:11.451 --> 24:13.584
I watch way
too many cartoons, I think.

24:13.586 --> 24:15.886
<i>♪ I'll be leaving tonight </i>

24:17.989 --> 24:20.991
<i>♪ be back home</i>
<i>tomorrow... ♪</i>

24:20.993 --> 24:22.927
Entering
the blue ridge parkway.

24:22.929 --> 24:24.595
Whoo-hoo!

24:26.765 --> 24:28.966
<i>♪ you wanna slow down </i>

24:28.968 --> 24:31.602
<i>♪ you wanna lay around </i>

24:31.604 --> 24:33.671
<i>♪ but let's ride... </i>

24:33.673 --> 24:36.640
Reedus:
<i>Most roads were built</i>
<i>to get from point a to point b.</i>

24:36.642 --> 24:38.242
<i>But the blue ridge parkway</i>
<i>was designed</i>

24:38.244 --> 24:40.478
<i>For the joy of the ride.</i>

24:40.480 --> 24:42.513
<i>It's a true example</i>
<i>of metaphor.</i>

24:42.515 --> 24:45.015
<i>The journey</i>
<i>is the destination.</i>

24:46.918 --> 24:48.252
Michaels:
<i>Oh, my god, dude.</i>

24:48.254 --> 24:49.820
Reedus:
<i>That is so beautiful!</i>

24:53.892 --> 24:55.259
Reedus:
Yeah.

25:08.807 --> 25:12.076
- Oh, my god!
- Oh, my god, dude!

25:12.911 --> 25:16.947
Reedus:
<i>This is-- I've never seen</i>
<i>anything like this.</i>

25:16.949 --> 25:19.817
<i>They just barely move.</i>

25:19.819 --> 25:20.885
So that's why they call
them the smoky mountains.

25:20.887 --> 25:22.620
'cause of that smoke.

25:22.622 --> 25:24.822
-  <i>Yeah.</i>
<i>- Michaels:</i> <i>That's awesome.</i>

25:24.824 --> 25:26.824
Reedus:
<i>I'm super happy</i>
<i>we did this.</i>

25:26.826 --> 25:28.626
- Definitely.
- There's nobody up here but us.

25:28.628 --> 25:30.127
- Nothing.
- Dragon was cool, too.

25:30.129 --> 25:32.763
But you're right,
it's, like, you know,
skip disneyland.

25:32.765 --> 25:34.665
There's a ton
of other rides.

25:34.667 --> 25:36.534
- That was a good move, like--
- it's true with everything.

25:36.536 --> 25:37.801
Restaurant
recommendations.

25:37.803 --> 25:39.603
- Absolutely, yeah.
- You know, everything.

25:39.605 --> 25:40.838
- Yeah, you got--
- girlfriends.

25:40.840 --> 25:41.805
- Yeah, girlfriends.
- You know what I mean?

25:41.807 --> 25:43.541
Yeah.

25:47.580 --> 25:48.846
See ya.

25:48.848 --> 25:51.549
To the broken spoke.
Whoo!

25:51.551 --> 25:53.317
Reedus:
<i>The last leg</i>
<i>of our journey, asheville.</i>

25:53.319 --> 25:56.253
<i>Which is 20 miles ahead.</i>

25:56.255 --> 25:58.856
<i>For now, we're just</i>
<i>enjoying the road and the ride.</i>

26:03.295 --> 26:05.095
You did 1,800 miles
on a grom?

26:05.097 --> 26:06.030
I did. Yes.

26:06.032 --> 26:07.631
Oh, my god, high five!

26:07.633 --> 26:08.732
You're insane!

26:08.734 --> 26:09.900
It was awesome!

26:09.902 --> 26:11.335
- Can I sit on it?
- Yeah.

26:11.337 --> 26:13.571
- Yeah.
- This is hysterical.

26:14.973 --> 26:16.774
Oh, my god,
this is so cute!

26:16.776 --> 26:18.576
It's a blast to ride.

26:18.578 --> 26:19.843
Set it up
for flat track.

26:20.846 --> 26:22.346
You gotta name it...

26:22.348 --> 26:23.881
Sparky or--

26:23.883 --> 26:25.716
- Michaels: <i>Sparky!</i>
<i>- Slayer, or something.</i>

26:25.718 --> 26:27.151
You're, like, one
of a kind right now.

26:27.153 --> 26:28.619
Michaels:
Trendsetter, right there.

26:28.621 --> 26:30.087
- You are a trendsetter.
- I guess so.

26:30.089 --> 26:32.356
And then how do you stick
someone on the back of this?

26:32.358 --> 26:33.891
dude, let, here--

26:33.893 --> 26:36.994
- Get up front! Get up front!
- Right?

26:37.997 --> 26:38.996
Dude, right?

26:38.998 --> 26:40.030
Let's go, dude!

26:41.167 --> 26:42.800
It's like
that scene from...

26:42.802 --> 26:43.801
- "dumb and dumber!"
- "dumb and dumber!"

26:43.803 --> 26:44.935
Yeah!

26:44.937 --> 26:45.903
We'll be,
like, freezing and--

26:45.905 --> 26:47.137
Samsonite!

26:52.211 --> 26:54.211
Michaels:
When am I gonna
get my ice cream?

26:54.213 --> 26:56.080
Michaels:
Let's make sure
you never get ice ream

26:56.082 --> 26:57.648
This whole trip.

27:00.752 --> 27:02.820
Reedus:
<i>Asheville's this</i>
<i>super relaxed town</i>

27:02.822 --> 27:05.956
<i>Where new age liberalism</i>
<i>meets bible belt conservatism.</i>

27:05.958 --> 27:08.892
<i>And at the end of the day,</i>
<i>they all go out for barbecue.</i>

27:11.796 --> 27:14.632
<i>We're here to visit</i>
<i>a broken spoke bike shop--</i>

27:14.634 --> 27:16.133
<i>A place specializing</i>
<i>in rare harley parts</i>

27:16.135 --> 27:18.202
<i>And frankenstein bikes.</i>

27:18.204 --> 27:22.640
<i>But we're always ready</i>
<i>to stop anywhere else</i>
<i>along the way.</i>

27:22.642 --> 27:24.708
Michaels:
<i>Hey, I got a detour</i>
<i>if you're game, bro.</i>

27:24.710 --> 27:26.710
You in the mood
for some old time religion?

27:26.712 --> 27:28.212
Hell yeah.
What do you mean?

27:28.214 --> 27:30.948
I heard of this guy,
apparently he loves jesus

27:30.950 --> 27:32.916
As much as he loves
motorcycles,

27:32.918 --> 27:35.819
So he started
a church for bikers.

27:35.821 --> 27:37.421
Supposedly,
it's pretty rad.

27:37.423 --> 27:39.256
Cool. Let's do it.

27:46.899 --> 27:51.802
<i>But you're here.</i>
<i>You know, it's not about</i>
<i>the building.</i>

27:51.804 --> 27:52.803
<i>It's not about the bikes.</i>

27:52.805 --> 27:57.174
<i>You know what I mean?</i>
<i>Thank god. God is good.</i>

27:57.176 --> 27:58.909
<i>You know what I am saying,</i>
<i>he is!</i>

27:58.911 --> 28:00.010
<i>He is!</i>

28:03.448 --> 28:05.182
That's what freedom's
all about.

28:05.184 --> 28:07.117
It's about-- when you're
riding across the country,

28:07.119 --> 28:08.852
It don't matter whether
you got long hair or tattoos.

28:08.854 --> 28:09.953
It don't matter.
You know what I mean?

28:09.955 --> 28:11.255
However you dress,

28:11.257 --> 28:13.691
There's so much
of that mess out there.

28:13.693 --> 28:14.892
You know, judging
your brother and sister.

28:14.894 --> 28:15.993
How many of y'all
have been judged

28:15.995 --> 28:17.294
Because of the way
you look?

28:17.296 --> 28:19.163
- Woman: <i>Yup. Yeah.</i>
<i>- Absolutely.</i>

28:19.165 --> 28:20.964
How many of y'all have judged
the guy in the suit and tie?

28:20.966 --> 28:22.066
Now, be honest.

28:22.068 --> 28:23.167
- Yeah.
-  <i>Absolutely.</i>

28:23.169 --> 28:24.968
The same goes both ways.

28:24.970 --> 28:27.705
You can't do that.
It's got to be out of love.

28:27.707 --> 28:29.707
<i>Life is a lot like a bike.</i>

28:29.709 --> 28:32.876
I you don't know how to ride it,
you're gonna wind up

28:32.878 --> 28:34.878
Somewhere
you don't wanna be.

28:34.880 --> 28:37.715
So, lord, I thank you
for this day.

28:39.117 --> 28:41.151
No doubt.

28:41.153 --> 28:46.990
I once was lost

28:46.992 --> 28:52.062
But now I'm found

28:52.064 --> 28:53.097
That was a beautiful
sermon.

28:53.099 --> 28:54.898
Thank you, brother.

28:54.900 --> 28:56.767
You said a lot of things
that really struck me in there.

28:56.769 --> 28:58.869
- Yeah.
- How long have you
had this church going?

28:58.871 --> 29:00.771
It's been seven years.
Been at this place for five.

29:00.773 --> 29:02.873
It's been a long road.
I mean, it's been a journey.

29:02.875 --> 29:05.075
And the lord has blessed us.
It started out--

29:05.077 --> 29:07.111
We got a network,
and there's 11 of us now.

29:07.113 --> 29:09.213
And the goal is to have them
throughout the United States,

29:09.215 --> 29:11.048
So that the biker
coming through,

29:11.050 --> 29:12.516
Man, he can stop,
and he know he's welcome.

29:12.518 --> 29:14.051
You know?

29:14.053 --> 29:16.086
I came out to the south,
and it was the first place

29:16.088 --> 29:19.256
I ever saw other bikers
wave to you as you go by.

29:19.258 --> 29:20.858
- And you think, you know what?
- Absolutely.

29:20.860 --> 29:22.226
Like, if I break down
on the side of the road,

29:22.228 --> 29:23.861
That's the guy that's
gonna come back and help me out.

29:23.863 --> 29:25.763
- It's the biker way of life.
- Yes, sir.

29:25.765 --> 29:28.165
I mean, even if somebody's
outside the biker community,

29:28.167 --> 29:29.533
Man, they need help?

29:29.535 --> 29:31.335
Man, the bikers
are gonna come and help.

29:31.337 --> 29:32.302
You throw on some
barbecue out there,

29:32.304 --> 29:33.537
And they'll really come.

29:34.907 --> 29:37.775
So I heard something
about an outhouse race

29:37.777 --> 29:39.243
Or something like that?
A porta-potty race?

29:39.245 --> 29:40.310
Yeah, come here and let
me show them to you.

29:40.312 --> 29:42.246
Yeah, let me see.

29:42.248 --> 29:44.281
Yeah, this is softtail.
The other one's hardtail.

29:44.283 --> 29:45.983
Michaels:
<i>I saw a custom porta-potty.</i>

29:45.985 --> 29:47.317
- You wanna get in one?
- Sure!

29:47.319 --> 29:48.952
- Michaels: Hell yeah!
- It's like-- I mean,

29:48.954 --> 29:51.088
How can I say no
to a custom porta-potty?

29:51.090 --> 29:53.090
We're gonna put him in there
and see how loud he screams.

29:53.092 --> 29:54.158
You know what I'm saying?

29:55.928 --> 29:57.361
- I'm so scared, actually.
- Oh, my god, dude.

30:02.200 --> 30:05.002
Woman:
<i>You do realize</i>
<i>you might die today?</i>

30:05.004 --> 30:06.804
This is terrifying.

30:06.806 --> 30:09.406
Hey, tattoo, dog man,
we're gonna do it
from right here.

30:09.408 --> 30:11.308
Reedus:
<i>I love that I won't</i>
<i>be able to make production</i>

30:11.310 --> 30:13.043
<i>On Monday on the show</i>

30:13.045 --> 30:14.878
Because I was killed
in a porta-potty.

30:16.015 --> 30:17.014
Ew.

30:17.016 --> 30:18.282
Whoo!

30:18.284 --> 30:19.283
The handle's right here.

30:19.285 --> 30:21.118
Oh, handle's right here.

30:21.120 --> 30:22.186
Man:
<i>Y'all know</i>
<i>the famous last words</i>

30:22.188 --> 30:23.253
<i>Of a southern redneck, right?</i>

30:23.255 --> 30:24.354
"hey, y'all!
Watch this!"

30:26.959 --> 30:28.292
You're going down, pal!

30:28.294 --> 30:30.427
eat my dust, norman!

30:30.429 --> 30:33.063
Whoo! All right, hit it.
Let's do it!

30:37.101 --> 30:39.903
Whoo!

30:39.905 --> 30:41.605
Yeah!

30:44.342 --> 30:46.176
- Did I win?
- You suck!

30:46.178 --> 30:47.177
I love it.

30:47.179 --> 30:48.178
I think I won.

30:48.180 --> 30:49.313
I love-- you did!

30:49.315 --> 30:50.380
- Yes!
- Oh, my god, dude!

30:50.382 --> 30:51.849
- That was crazy!
- Amazing!

30:51.851 --> 30:52.850
Amazing!

30:52.852 --> 30:54.117
Literally, holy.

30:54.119 --> 30:55.319
Thank you.

30:55.321 --> 30:57.154
Whoo! Whoo!

30:57.156 --> 30:58.322
Reedus:
<i>There's a real sense</i>
<i>of community</i>

30:58.324 --> 31:00.157
<i>And camaraderie</i>
<i>in asheville.</i>

31:00.159 --> 31:02.359
<i>And taking a ride with</i>
<i>the whole congregation</i>

31:02.361 --> 31:04.294
<i>Was my kind</i>
<i>of church social.</i>

31:15.640 --> 31:16.940
Michaels:
You up for one more detour?

31:16.942 --> 31:18.242
Always.

31:18.244 --> 31:19.443
There's this place
I've been to.

31:19.445 --> 31:21.879
They make real
corn mash moonshine.

31:21.881 --> 31:23.013
It's called
the howling moon distillery.

31:23.015 --> 31:24.882
<i>Now you're talking.</i>

31:29.655 --> 31:31.455
We're here.

31:33.958 --> 31:35.192
Are you ready,
"freddy?"

31:35.194 --> 31:37.361
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
-  <i>Oh, wait.</i>

31:37.363 --> 31:40.330
Check this out.

32:02.086 --> 32:03.320
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

32:03.322 --> 32:05.088
Reedus:
<i>I know what this looks like.</i>

32:05.090 --> 32:06.690
<i>You can't write this stuff</i>
<i>even if you tried.</i>

32:06.692 --> 32:08.992
Who's a good dog?
Who's a good dog?

32:08.994 --> 32:11.094
<i>But I swear,</i>
<i>we just rode up on this guy</i>

32:11.096 --> 32:13.130
<i>And he was already playing,</i>
<i>right across the road</i>

32:13.132 --> 32:15.332
<i>From the moonshine</i>
<i>distillery.</i>

32:15.334 --> 32:19.169
<i>Sometimes the south</i>
<i>is even more "the south"</i>
<i>than you expect.</i>

32:20.239 --> 32:22.005
Nice to meet you guys.
I'm norman.

32:22.007 --> 32:23.440
- How you guys doing?
- Great.

32:23.442 --> 32:25.008
- It's hot outside, but it's--
- yeah, it is.

32:25.010 --> 32:27.210
- Have a good ride?
- Yeah, it was awesome.

32:27.212 --> 32:29.379
Reedus:
Is this a family business?

32:29.381 --> 32:31.481
Has it been passed on--

32:31.483 --> 32:34.418
Yeah, this has been
in my family for generations,
making moonshine.

32:34.420 --> 32:36.353
This condenser here,
this copper condenser,

32:36.355 --> 32:38.088
<i>Is about 125, 150 years old.</i>

32:38.090 --> 32:40.190
- No way!
- Whoa!

32:40.192 --> 32:43.260
- Yeah.
- Can I ask, like, what's
the legal points around this?

32:43.262 --> 32:44.728
Absolutely. 100% legal.

32:44.730 --> 32:46.296
What does the rock do?
I just gotta ask.

32:46.298 --> 32:47.364
Keeps it from blowing up.

32:47.366 --> 32:49.166
Oh, good.
Good. Good.

32:49.168 --> 32:50.334
This is about as old school
as it gets.

32:53.571 --> 32:55.739
- Ooh, what's this?
- This is our mash room.

32:55.741 --> 32:57.074
This is where all
the magic happens.

32:57.076 --> 32:59.109
Oh, wow!
Take in that smell!

32:59.111 --> 33:01.011
If I just stick
my face in that

33:01.013 --> 33:02.212
And inhale, will I be drunk?

33:02.214 --> 33:03.447
It'll get you started.

33:03.449 --> 33:05.749
You know, yeah, see--
do it. Come on.

33:05.751 --> 33:06.750
Okay.

33:08.120 --> 33:09.386
I went to church
this morning.

33:09.388 --> 33:10.587
-  <i>Yeah, you did.</i>
<i>- You know what I mean?</i>

33:10.589 --> 33:12.155
- It'll burn your eyes.
- It'll get so bad

33:12.157 --> 33:13.290
That you can't even
come in this room

33:16.327 --> 33:18.562
- Whew.
- Right? You get
a little lightheaded.

33:18.564 --> 33:20.998
Yeah, absolutely. Oh, yeah.

33:21.000 --> 33:21.999
Whew.

33:22.001 --> 33:23.133
It'll get you.

33:23.135 --> 33:24.134
Your eyes
are starting to water.

33:26.271 --> 33:29.406
After prohibition started,
they outlawed alcohol
all over america.

33:29.408 --> 33:32.309
It created a boom.
There was more alcohol
than ever.

33:32.311 --> 33:34.177
You know, everybody
that could find a still

33:34.179 --> 33:36.079
<i>Or make a still</i>
<i>started one up.</i>

33:36.081 --> 33:37.547
And they hauled it
all over the country.

33:37.549 --> 33:40.183
And to get it there,
they had to have fast drivers.

33:40.185 --> 33:41.418
They had to outrun
the law.

33:41.420 --> 33:43.253
And that's what they did.

33:43.255 --> 33:45.789
That's how, you know, a lot
of that nascar came to be.

33:45.791 --> 33:47.324
They started
outrunning all the law,

33:47.326 --> 33:48.525
And there was no law
that could chase 'em,

33:48.527 --> 33:50.193
So they started
racing each other.

33:50.195 --> 33:51.194
Do you know anybody
that used to take those roads?

33:51.196 --> 33:53.296
Any stories back then?

33:53.298 --> 33:56.333
Yeah, my dad and my uncle,
they both used to do it
all the time.

33:56.335 --> 33:57.534
Wow. That's cool.

33:57.536 --> 33:59.503
Where are they?

33:59.505 --> 34:01.238
Daddy, ernie,
come here for a minute!

34:03.041 --> 34:04.274
Super bee!

34:04.276 --> 34:06.176
- Wow.
- A super bee!

34:06.178 --> 34:08.178
- Hi, how are ya?
- How are ya?

34:08.180 --> 34:10.113
- Norman.
- Nice meeting you, man.

34:10.115 --> 34:11.381
It's a pleasure, man.
Hi.

34:11.383 --> 34:13.050
Yes, sir.

34:13.052 --> 34:14.351
We were just talking
about back in the day,

34:14.353 --> 34:16.520
When the moonshine
guys used to build cars

34:16.522 --> 34:18.188
That were faster
than the cops.

34:18.190 --> 34:22.125
We heard a rumor
you guys used to do that.

34:22.127 --> 34:23.326
Oh, yes.

34:29.634 --> 34:31.368
Knock on wood, yeah.

34:56.495 --> 34:58.095
Can I get a shot of you
on this car?

34:58.097 --> 34:59.496
You look too cool
right now.

34:59.498 --> 35:01.331
This looks awesome.

35:01.333 --> 35:03.233
- Bam!
- Hey, got you a little
something over here.

35:03.235 --> 35:04.234
Whoo-hoo!

35:05.636 --> 35:06.636
Today was a good day.

35:08.440 --> 35:09.873
Looks like it's gonna be
a good night.

35:09.875 --> 35:11.575
Right? A very good night.

35:11.577 --> 35:13.210
Bang, bang, bang, bang,
bang, bang, bang, bang,

35:13.212 --> 35:14.578
Bang, bang, bang,
bang, bang.

35:14.580 --> 35:16.613
Those were, like,
the legends that we met.

35:16.615 --> 35:18.515
Yeah,
I think we just met
the kings right there.

35:18.517 --> 35:19.883
We're running shine.

35:19.885 --> 35:21.451
It doesn't get
any better than this.

35:21.453 --> 35:23.286
<i>Yeah, what a good day.</i>

35:23.288 --> 35:25.489
Wait for me, dude.
I don't wanna get
caught by the cops.

35:25.491 --> 35:27.224
If we go down, we're
going down together.

35:35.200 --> 35:39.236
<i>Who used to sneak gin</i>
<i>out of his grandfather's</i>
<i>liquor cabinet.</i>

35:39.238 --> 35:41.171
<i>The old man would scratch</i>
<i>a line into the bottle</i>

35:41.173 --> 35:43.306
<i>Just to know if any of it</i>
<i>was missing.</i>

35:43.308 --> 35:46.610
<i>So my friend made up</i>
<i>the difference with</i>
<i>rubbing alcohol.</i>

35:46.612 --> 35:48.545
<i>They found the old man</i>
<i>in a neighbor's rose garden</i>

35:48.547 --> 35:51.281
<i>One Sunday morning</i>
<i>naked and laughing his ass off.</i>

35:51.283 --> 35:53.150
<i>I imagine that's how</i>
<i>they're gonna find me</i>

35:53.152 --> 35:55.152
<i>And jason when we</i>

36:10.669 --> 36:13.403
Reedus:
<i>The last place I want to hit--</i>
<i>a broken spoke.</i>

36:13.405 --> 36:16.439
<i>It's an old school harley</i>
<i>repair shop with bike parts</i>

36:16.441 --> 36:18.308
<i>You can't find anywhere</i>
<i>else in the country.</i>

36:18.310 --> 36:20.310
<i>It's just ten miles</i>
<i>up the road.</i>

36:30.189 --> 36:32.556
Jason, I think you're
gonna love a broken spoke.

36:32.558 --> 36:34.324
I heard they have
a ton of rare parts

36:34.326 --> 36:36.593
That people haven't
even seen in years.

36:36.595 --> 36:38.595
<i>We're headed</i>
<i>for a broken spoke,</i>

36:38.597 --> 36:41.531
<i>A local hangout spot</i>
<i>and repair shop specializing</i>

36:41.533 --> 36:43.733
<i>In vintage harleys</i>
<i>and seldom-seen parts.</i>

36:56.581 --> 36:58.415
<i>Wow!</i>
<i>This is a broken spoke!</i>

37:00.719 --> 37:02.285
Michaels:
<i>Yeah, let's check</i>
<i>this out, man.</i>

37:02.287 --> 37:04.588
Wow!

37:04.590 --> 37:05.689
This is awesome.

37:09.660 --> 37:11.595
Look at this terrifying
little thing.

37:11.597 --> 37:13.530
Wow, pure evil.

37:13.532 --> 37:16.800
Yeah, you could take a million
pictures in this place.

37:16.802 --> 37:18.468
This is like a museum
in here.

37:18.470 --> 37:19.769
Hey. Norman.

37:19.771 --> 37:21.004
How you doing, norman?
D. Wayne, norman.

37:21.006 --> 37:22.472
- Jason.
- Hello, jason.

37:22.474 --> 37:23.540
Where'd the name
broken spoke come from?

37:23.542 --> 37:25.242
Where-- what's the story
with that?

37:25.244 --> 37:28.011
We're kinda infatuated
with frank, you know?

37:28.013 --> 37:29.713
Full of complex pieces
and parts.

37:29.715 --> 37:31.715
Frankenstein,
I love it.

37:31.717 --> 37:33.683
This back through here
is like, overflow.

37:33.685 --> 37:35.485
Oh, that's sick!

37:35.487 --> 37:37.254
Is that original?

37:37.256 --> 37:39.422
- Yeah.
- Oh, my god,
that's like gold dust.

37:39.424 --> 37:40.790
- Sure, it is.
- Why is it so rare?

37:40.792 --> 37:43.260
Um, well,
they quit casting.

37:43.262 --> 37:46.696
Aluminum casts,
they quit 'em in '65, '66, '67.

37:46.698 --> 37:48.431
You know, they didn't
do 'em very long.

37:48.433 --> 37:49.733
Oh, yeah.
Old sugar bear.

37:49.735 --> 37:51.568
- What's sugar bear?
- West coast stuff.

37:51.570 --> 37:52.602
- Back in--
- he was, like, one
of the only black guys

37:52.604 --> 37:53.637
Building choppers.

37:53.639 --> 37:55.038
He was the only.
Yeah, yeah.

37:55.040 --> 37:57.040
Oh, is this, like
a legit bates seat?

37:57.042 --> 37:58.775
- Yeah.
- Oh, my god!

37:58.777 --> 38:00.443
Is this, like,
christmas morning for you?

38:00.445 --> 38:02.612
Wow,
look at this old fulmer.

38:02.614 --> 38:04.314
Oh, my god, man.

38:04.316 --> 38:06.449
- Man!
- You're geeking out right now.

38:06.451 --> 38:08.385
Dude, totally.
You're witnessing--

38:08.387 --> 38:09.753
Are you putting
together a motorcycle
in your mind right now?

38:09.755 --> 38:12.689
I am. Like, I see so much
happening right now.

38:12.691 --> 38:14.791
Wow.
It's like legends and lore.

38:14.793 --> 38:16.459
Nobody really knows
where you guys are.

38:16.461 --> 38:17.727
It's, like,
you hear about it--

38:17.729 --> 38:18.728
That's not a bad thing.

38:22.501 --> 38:24.701
Hey, cutie.
Nice to meet you too.

38:24.703 --> 38:26.803
My boy rides.
He's right there on that one.

38:26.805 --> 38:28.438
He's running over
that other kid.

38:28.440 --> 38:30.073
<i>I saw him earlier.</i>

38:30.075 --> 38:32.309
There he goes again.
He got him again.

38:32.311 --> 38:33.310
That's my kind of kid
right there.

38:33.312 --> 38:34.511
Yeah.

38:34.513 --> 38:36.079
Everybody
knows everybody here.

38:36.081 --> 38:38.748
Oh, yeah. Yeah.
We're all we got.

38:38.750 --> 38:40.850
Good vibes.
Yeah, love it. Love it.

38:40.852 --> 38:44.454
Brother, I just wanna say
thank you for this experience.

38:44.456 --> 38:45.455
Oh, dude. Thank you, man.

38:45.457 --> 38:46.690
Yeah,
this has been great.

38:46.692 --> 38:48.091
I mean, it's all been
about brotherhood, and--

38:48.093 --> 38:49.526
And what he said in there,
he goes,

38:49.528 --> 38:51.494
"we're all we got,"
you know? And...

38:51.496 --> 38:53.363
Camaraderie, right?
It's cool.

38:53.365 --> 38:54.564
Yeah, little terrors
on big wheels

38:54.566 --> 38:56.499
Running each other
over and stuff.

38:56.501 --> 38:59.402
Yeah, this--
you know, and I think
there's a stereotype

38:59.404 --> 39:02.472
About, you know,
people who ride harleys
and stuff like that,

39:02.474 --> 39:04.507
And they're not.
They're all cool people,
you know?

39:04.509 --> 39:05.508
No. Yeah,
it's been a ride, man.
I appreciate it.

39:05.510 --> 39:07.410
It's been fun. Yeah.

39:07.412 --> 39:08.645
Reedus:
<i>You know, people sometimes</i>
<i>think of bikers</i>

39:08.647 --> 39:10.747
<i>As outlaws or malcontents,</i>

39:10.749 --> 39:12.882
<i>But a broken spoke</i>
<i>has a spirit of community</i>

39:12.884 --> 39:14.417
<i>That proves the opposite.</i>

39:14.419 --> 39:16.619
Nice to meet you.
You have a lightsaber.

39:16.621 --> 39:19.789
<i>Whether they're bikers,</i>
<i>neighbors, kids, or hipsters,</i>

39:19.791 --> 39:22.125
<i>The people who</i>
<i>gather here are all spokes</i>
<i>on the same wheel.</i>

39:22.127 --> 39:24.394
This is quite the party.
It's a good vibe.

39:24.396 --> 39:26.463
<i>No matter who you are</i>
<i>or what you ride,</i>

39:26.465 --> 39:30.567
<i>You're gonna be welcomed</i>
<i>with the same open arms.</i>

39:30.569 --> 39:33.503
<i>Sometimes we just gotta</i>
<i>burn a little rubber.</i>

39:33.505 --> 39:36.673
<i>"burning in hell" playing</i>

39:38.509 --> 39:41.845
<i>♪ fire in my heart </i>

39:43.681 --> 39:47.617
<i>♪ left me</i>
<i>burning in hell ♪</i>

39:48.886 --> 39:53.690
<i>♪ demons keep</i>
<i>a close eye ♪</i>

39:53.692 --> 39:58.862
<i>♪ it seems</i>
<i>there's no way out ♪</i>

39:58.864 --> 40:01.564
<i>♪ he started a flame </i>

40:01.566 --> 40:04.801
<i>♪ he left me to burn,</i>
<i>there's no one... ♪</i>

40:04.803 --> 40:06.903
<i>Well, I wish I could tell you</i>
<i>about the rest of the night.</i>

40:06.905 --> 40:09.939
It involved something
called the "chopper chug."

40:09.941 --> 40:10.940
Start it!

40:27.191 --> 40:29.692
<i>The trip went by so fast,</i>

40:29.694 --> 40:33.563
<i>But it's time to head home,</i>
<i>back to atlanta.</i>

40:33.565 --> 40:34.964
Michaels:
I would definitely
stay longer in asheville

40:34.966 --> 40:37.500
If we had more time.
What about you?

40:37.502 --> 40:40.737
Reedus: <i>Man, I'd love</i>
<i>to stay here and check</i>
<i>more of this place out.</i>

40:40.739 --> 40:43.573
I say before
we head out of town

40:43.575 --> 40:44.841
We make
that one last stop.

40:44.843 --> 40:47.610
You know what I want.

40:58.889 --> 41:00.890
- Oh.
- Mm.

41:00.892 --> 41:02.659
This was a good idea.
I have to say.

41:02.661 --> 41:03.760
See,
you should listen
to me more.

41:03.762 --> 41:05.528
I should.

41:05.530 --> 41:07.864
There has been nothing

41:07.866 --> 41:09.766
That I haven't loved
about this trip, man.

41:09.768 --> 41:13.937
I have a new appreciation
for the south.

41:13.939 --> 41:15.839
I can't think of anything
that we did

41:15.841 --> 41:18.708
That wasn't awesome,
you know?

41:18.710 --> 41:19.809
What do you gotta
do on Monday?

41:19.811 --> 41:21.044
I gotta go back to work.

41:21.046 --> 41:23.546
I have a super early
call tomorrow.

41:23.548 --> 41:24.781
Man,
I gotta get a haircut.

41:24.783 --> 41:27.517
need a haircut.

41:27.519 --> 41:28.618
Tell me about it.
You and my mom,

41:28.620 --> 41:29.619
That's all you guys
talk about.

41:29.621 --> 41:30.720
Got a little more time.

41:30.722 --> 41:31.788
We still
got some daylight.

41:31.790 --> 41:33.756
Let's hit that, uh--
what is that?

41:33.758 --> 41:38.061
That chewbacca sky rocket.
Let's do that.

41:38.063 --> 41:40.830
The chalupa freeway.

41:40.832 --> 41:45.535
Yeah. We'll hit
the cherohala skyway.

41:45.537 --> 41:47.036
- Chewbacca, here we come!
- Whoo!

41:50.774 --> 41:53.576
Make chewbacca noises
the whole way there.

42:02.720 --> 42:05.588
Reedus: <i>Back at apex,</i>
<i>things were neat and precise,</i>

42:05.590 --> 42:07.690
<i>While at a broken spoke,</i>
<i>they specialized</i>

42:07.692 --> 42:10.927
<i>In good old</i>
<i>american chaos.</i>

42:10.929 --> 42:13.029
<i>They both served</i>
<i>the same free spirit</i>

42:13.031 --> 42:14.998
<i>That we found deals gap,</i>
<i>the howling moon,</i>

42:15.000 --> 42:16.533
<i>The freedom biker church,</i>

42:16.535 --> 42:18.101
<i>And on</i>
<i>the blue ridge parkway.</i>

42:18.103 --> 42:20.069
<i>And the people we found</i>
<i>were as inviting</i>

42:20.071 --> 42:23.540
<i>As they were generous.</i>

42:23.542 --> 42:24.307
<i>When you're young,</i>
<i>you do half-assed things</i>

42:24.309 --> 42:26.009
<i>Just to do them.</i>

42:26.011 --> 42:28.878
<i>You don't think about risk</i>
<i>and loss and danger,</i>

42:28.880 --> 42:31.548
<i>Because the thought</i>
<i>that you're not going</i>
<i>to live forever</i>

42:31.550 --> 42:32.982
<i>Hasn't even</i>
<i>crossed your mind.</i>

42:32.984 --> 42:35.585
<i>And sometimes,</i>
<i>in your enthusiasm,</i>

42:35.587 --> 42:37.854
<i>You don't even think about</i>
<i>the miracles around you--</i>

42:37.856 --> 42:40.089
<i>The awesome scenery,</i>
<i>the fantastic people,</i>

42:40.091 --> 42:41.858
<i>And the love</i>
<i>they feel for each other,</i>

42:41.860 --> 42:46.062
<i>Or the trickle of summer sweat</i>
<i>on your forehead.</i>

42:46.064 --> 42:49.699
<i>It's great being old enough</i>
<i>to appreciate the journey</i>

42:49.701 --> 42:51.701
<i>Instead of obsessing</i>
<i>over what's next.</i>

42:51.703 --> 42:55.171
<i>After all, it's the ride</i>
<i>that matters most,</i>

42:55.173 --> 42:58.007
<i>And it's just</i>
<i>where I wanna be.</i>
