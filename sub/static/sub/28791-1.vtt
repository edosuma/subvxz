01:49.848 --> 01:51.415
- I really like you, is there a
way

01:51.459 --> 01:53.809
for me to get you back?

01:53.852 --> 01:56.159
I mean not in a weird way, just.

01:56.203 --> 01:59.206
- If I'm in your area and I'm on

02:00.381 --> 02:01.556
and I'm the closest one to you,

02:01.599 --> 02:03.253
that's kind of how it works is
it just

02:03.297 --> 02:05.864
requests the closest driver to
you.

02:05.908 --> 02:07.866
- So I can't just like call you,

02:07.910 --> 02:10.695
have special code. Like uh-

02:10.739 --> 02:12.958
- No I don't have like a
referral code

02:13.002 --> 02:15.047
that I can give out.

02:15.091 --> 02:17.354
- That is so disappointing
'cause

02:17.398 --> 02:20.792
I was thinking about
calling you tomorrow morning

02:20.836 --> 02:23.752
to get my car which I have no
idea

02:23.795 --> 02:25.014
where it's at actually.

02:25.057 --> 02:27.408
- Oh you need to get
back to your car, I see.

02:27.451 --> 02:29.584
Yeah, no I'm probably gonna
drive pretty late tonight

02:29.627 --> 02:32.761
and then I won't really be on
tomorrow

02:32.804 --> 02:35.546
until real late at night again.

02:35.590 --> 02:37.287
It is a little bit too early in
the night.

02:37.331 --> 02:39.637
- Your tag is out.

02:40.812 --> 02:41.813
There you go.

02:41.857 --> 02:42.640
- Thank you.

02:42.684 --> 02:43.685
- You're welcome.

02:43.728 --> 02:46.688
- Is it fixed? Thank you.

02:46.731 --> 02:49.299
- I can't stand tags being out.

02:50.170 --> 02:51.432
- I see that.

02:51.475 --> 02:55.218
Well I hope you make it
to your car tomorrow,

02:55.262 --> 02:56.611
I hope you get a good driver
- Thank you, you're sure

02:56.654 --> 02:59.657
I can't get your number,
I can pay under the table,

02:59.701 --> 03:01.093
like twice as much.

03:01.137 --> 03:03.095
- That is a very generous offer.

03:03.139 --> 03:05.968
- It's just in case 'cause
some driver are crazy.

03:06.011 --> 03:07.883
- Yeah, that's true, that's
true.

03:07.926 --> 03:11.800
They don't really vet us that
well.

03:11.843 --> 03:13.845
- That's here.
- Here you are.

03:13.889 --> 03:15.673
- Well that was fun.

03:15.717 --> 03:18.154
- You have been a delight.

03:18.198 --> 03:19.677
- I'll put you five stars.

03:19.721 --> 03:21.549
- Thank you, I'll put you five
stars too.

03:21.592 --> 03:23.115
- If I could put six I would.

03:23.986 --> 03:25.596
- That's very nice of you.

03:25.640 --> 03:27.598
Have a good night.
- You too, bye bye.

03:40.045 --> 03:41.090
- And we're out.

03:52.057 --> 03:54.625
- Unfortunately the
police officer out there

03:54.669 --> 03:55.670
wasn't willing to help me hail a
cab

03:55.713 --> 03:57.106
even though I can't see very
well

03:57.149 --> 04:00.240
and there were these small group

04:00.283 --> 04:01.850
of people there's two girls and
a guy

04:01.893 --> 04:03.982
that walked by and the guy was
trying

04:04.026 --> 04:05.114
to give me his number and I
thought

04:05.157 --> 04:07.421
well that's kind of strange, you
know.

04:07.464 --> 04:10.641
So I said no no no it's alright,

04:10.685 --> 04:12.252
I appreciate the offer.

04:12.295 --> 04:15.603
As he was walking away
I yelled out, peace.

04:17.692 --> 04:19.868
And so the girls started
laughing

04:19.911 --> 04:23.219
and the guy was like peace,
peace to the middle east.

04:26.570 --> 04:28.006
- So you made a friend.

04:28.050 --> 04:31.793
- Yeah, yeah exactly I
turned a negative situation

04:31.836 --> 04:33.360
into a positive.
- Yeah, that's good

04:33.403 --> 04:35.057
that's really good.

04:39.540 --> 04:41.281
Okay, here we are.

04:49.985 --> 04:51.291
You need an arm?

05:00.082 --> 05:01.344
Hey, fuzzy.

05:01.388 --> 05:04.129
- Hey, how's your night
going?

05:04.173 --> 05:06.784
- Good, you got good timing
I'm in between rides.

05:06.828 --> 05:08.743
- Are you making
millions of dollars.

05:08.786 --> 05:10.222
- Millions and millions.

05:11.615 --> 05:13.922
- Alright snuggle
me good when you get home.

05:13.965 --> 05:15.315
- Always do.

05:15.358 --> 05:17.839
- And don't forget, Simon
is coming over tomorrow.

05:17.882 --> 05:19.014
- Got it.

05:19.057 --> 05:21.321
- Okay, I love you.
- I love you too.

05:21.364 --> 05:23.323
- Night.
- Good night, fuzzy.

11:06.927 --> 11:11.496
Jesus Christ, yeah.

11:18.852 --> 11:20.288
Scared the hell out of me.

11:20.331 --> 11:21.637
- Yeah, sorry.

11:21.681 --> 11:24.074
Let me ask you something is this
like

11:24.118 --> 11:26.903
your first fare, your last fare?

11:26.947 --> 11:28.731
- I'm toward the beginning,
yeah.

11:28.775 --> 11:32.909
- Alright, so here's the thing,
I really

11:32.953 --> 11:37.522
have nowhere to be and I just
don't want to be at home.

11:37.566 --> 11:40.961
So if you're okay with it, let's
just

11:41.004 --> 11:44.921
keep the meter running
and drive me around a bit.

11:47.054 --> 11:48.446
- Where?

11:49.578 --> 11:50.537
- Your call.

11:51.623 --> 11:53.364
What's your favorite place in
the city?

11:54.322 --> 11:55.225
- Really?

11:55.236 --> 11:56.672
- I mean maybe not your favorite

11:56.716 --> 11:58.848
if you don't want to
give it away but whatever

11:58.892 --> 12:00.981
I mean just you know, I really
don't

12:01.024 --> 12:05.986
want to be at the house so yeah,
I'm free.

12:07.422 --> 12:10.120
I mean not free, I'll
pay you obviously but.

12:10.164 --> 12:12.949
- Yeah yeah you got it, sure.
- Alright.

12:30.010 --> 12:31.707
- What is happening?

12:38.105 --> 12:40.281
How do you have Brandon's phone?

12:40.324 --> 12:43.153
- Babe, it's me.

12:48.028 --> 12:51.640
Look, that's you and me.

12:54.034 --> 12:55.209
Everything's okay.

12:56.776 --> 12:57.602
I can feed you.

12:58.560 --> 12:59.387
- I'm not hungry.

13:00.780 --> 13:03.608
- If you don't eat, you're
gonna be really hungry

13:03.652 --> 13:05.175
and you're not gonna feel good.

13:05.219 --> 13:06.742
- I'm okay.
- I know how you get.

13:06.786 --> 13:08.352
- I don't eat breakfast,
you should know that.

13:08.396 --> 13:09.658
- You always breakfast I bring

13:09.701 --> 13:12.704
it to you most the time.
- I never eat breakfast.

13:12.748 --> 13:14.619
- Fuzzy, you almost always
eat breakfast because--

13:14.663 --> 13:17.492
- I never eat breakfast!

13:17.535 --> 13:18.798
- How's your night going?

13:20.756 --> 13:24.020
- I've had better weeks
but the night's not bad,

13:24.064 --> 13:25.543
it's getting started, right?

13:25.587 --> 13:26.849
- Right.

13:26.893 --> 13:28.590
- Really just needed to clear my
head,

13:28.633 --> 13:29.852
get out for a bit.

13:29.896 --> 13:32.289
I like to take a brain break

13:32.333 --> 13:33.856
every once in a while.

13:33.900 --> 13:36.598
- Brain break, everybody
needs a brain break.

13:37.512 --> 13:38.992
- No.

13:39.035 --> 13:40.515
- I'm gonna back up, look.

13:50.133 --> 13:53.441
Okay, just have a little
breakfast and relax.

13:56.574 --> 13:58.620
You want me to cut it for you?

14:08.021 --> 14:08.891
- God dammit.

14:09.979 --> 14:10.893
- What's going on?

14:14.549 --> 14:16.551
- Megan, she wants me to
come over there tonight

14:16.594 --> 14:19.249
and I just, I don't honestly

14:19.293 --> 14:20.685
know if I'm ready for that.

14:22.122 --> 14:23.427
- Like, literally two weeks ago

14:23.471 --> 14:24.907
was the last time I spoke to
him.

14:24.951 --> 14:26.909
All he'll do is text me,
I tried to call it went

14:26.953 --> 14:28.128
straight to voicemail.

14:28.171 --> 14:30.565
I mean he's just going through
something

14:30.608 --> 14:31.653
and we just need to talk

14:31.696 --> 14:33.176
in person and we can figure this
out.

14:34.308 --> 14:37.311
- I've been living with my lady
now

14:37.354 --> 14:40.749
for probably about almost two
years.

14:41.750 --> 14:42.577
- Yeah.

14:44.274 --> 14:47.060
- And we've been on rocky ground

14:47.103 --> 14:48.670
for a couple weeks now so I've
just

14:48.713 --> 14:49.758
been kind of staying with my
friend now

14:49.801 --> 14:52.413
to let it, let it air out.

14:52.456 --> 14:53.588
- Okay.
- Yeah.

14:55.068 --> 14:56.373
- Are you gonna make it through
it

14:56.417 --> 14:58.854
or do you want to or what?

14:58.898 --> 15:00.029
- I don't actually know.

15:01.683 --> 15:03.990
- Gotcha, gotcha.

15:04.033 --> 15:05.948
- I mean we got in a fight

15:05.992 --> 15:10.213
but I found a gay dating app on
his phone.

15:10.257 --> 15:11.780
- And what about you, mate?

15:11.823 --> 15:16.045
- Well I am in a functional
relationship

15:16.089 --> 15:19.483
for probably the first time in
my life.

15:20.571 --> 15:21.572
- For how long?

15:22.530 --> 15:24.880
- We are at the three year mark.

15:24.924 --> 15:26.316
- Wow.
- Yeah.

15:27.448 --> 15:29.319
- I mean that's astounding to
me.

15:29.363 --> 15:33.019
- Three happy years, too I have
to say.

15:33.062 --> 15:35.935
I mean there hasn't been any
more

15:35.978 --> 15:38.894
than just a couple of spats.

15:38.938 --> 15:40.983
I mean we've had our serious
fights but

15:42.376 --> 15:43.986
it's really amazing how the next
day

15:44.030 --> 15:45.727
we're always just able to kind
of

15:45.770 --> 15:48.338
wake up and forgive each other.

15:48.382 --> 15:51.211
- Come on, breakfast is
important, you need to eat.

15:51.254 --> 15:52.560
Come on, fuzzy.

15:59.045 --> 16:00.698
Here, take it, okay.

16:06.356 --> 16:07.967
- What do you do for work?

16:08.010 --> 16:08.924
- Photography.

16:08.968 --> 16:10.708
- Oh.
- Yeah.

16:10.752 --> 16:11.709
- And how did you meet your
lady?

16:11.753 --> 16:13.711
- Okay so long story short,

16:13.755 --> 16:15.409
whether it's gonna be long I
don't know

16:15.452 --> 16:17.802
but long story I guess.

16:17.846 --> 16:19.500
We met during a photo shoot
and--

16:19.543 --> 16:20.718
- Oh, okay.

16:20.762 --> 16:23.460
- Yeah and she's stunning, just
beautiful.

16:24.853 --> 16:28.378
Caring, sweet, smart, and we met

16:28.422 --> 16:31.425
and we didn't leave each
others side for two weeks.

16:31.468 --> 16:35.037
- One of those where you're
just like instantly connected.

16:35.081 --> 16:37.300
- Right, absolutely and we've
been living

16:37.344 --> 16:38.954
together ever since.

16:41.130 --> 16:43.872
She had been wanting it
to get to go the next step

16:43.915 --> 16:46.266
and I've just been a little
hesitant to--

16:46.309 --> 16:47.876
- Threesome?
- What, no.

16:47.919 --> 16:49.356
- No I'm just kidding.

16:49.399 --> 16:50.792
Kids or marriage?

16:50.835 --> 16:53.490
- Marriage but my lady and I had
a bit

16:53.534 --> 16:56.319
of an argument, life changing
argument

16:56.363 --> 16:59.975
and she doesn't really
understand my work.

17:00.019 --> 17:03.239
You see, when I take a
photo, my job isn't to just

17:03.283 --> 17:04.371
take the photo you know.

17:04.414 --> 17:05.807
It's not to just get a pretty
face.

17:05.849 --> 17:06.634
- Right.

17:06.676 --> 17:09.550
- It's to evoke emotion.

17:09.593 --> 17:11.117
I need to be able to say what is
going

17:11.160 --> 17:13.597
on with your life, I
need to be able to feel

17:13.641 --> 17:15.643
what it is that's coming from
that.

17:15.685 --> 17:17.123
And as soon as a I figure that
out,

17:17.165 --> 17:18.776
I knew how to handle people.

17:20.082 --> 17:23.520
And it was all human
behavior more than anything,

17:24.694 --> 17:28.960
it was just like I knew
how to get something

17:29.004 --> 17:32.921
from you, you know, no matter
what it is.

17:36.142 --> 17:37.012
- Alright.

17:39.928 --> 17:42.409
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

17:49.242 --> 17:50.069
Easy.

18:00.209 --> 18:02.037
- Simon.
- Who is Simon?

18:02.081 --> 18:03.212
- Our wedding planner Simon is--

18:03.256 --> 18:04.605
- Oh god, I totally forgot.

18:04.648 --> 18:05.954
- Coming over.
- Okay.

18:07.129 --> 18:08.087
- Simon, Simon.

18:09.349 --> 18:12.265
- Let me here, let's take this
right here.

18:12.308 --> 18:14.267
Don't want you to make a mess

18:14.310 --> 18:15.442
- Just a second.

18:17.183 --> 18:18.097
Yeah, Simon.

18:18.140 --> 18:19.663
- Here we go, yeah that's fine.

18:19.707 --> 18:21.056
- He's supposed to be coming
over.

18:21.100 --> 18:23.711
- Okay, I don't wanna hurt you.

18:23.754 --> 18:24.755
- Oh my god.

18:26.409 --> 18:27.671
- Okay?
- Yeah.

18:30.109 --> 18:32.154
- I don't want you to look all
frumpy.

18:38.726 --> 18:39.857
- In my business you need to be

18:39.901 --> 18:40.858
sort of like a chameleon in
order

18:40.902 --> 18:42.382
to connect with people.

18:42.425 --> 18:43.513
- Yeah.

18:43.557 --> 18:44.384
- And it's not a whole lot
different

18:44.427 --> 18:45.689
than what you probably do,

18:45.733 --> 18:48.431
I mean you probably act
a little bit different

18:48.475 --> 18:50.129
every time you have someone
different

18:50.172 --> 18:51.347
in your vehicle, right?

18:51.391 --> 18:54.350
- Absolutely, I feel like I have
to change

18:54.394 --> 18:58.180
my personality for
every new person I meet.

18:58.224 --> 18:59.355
- Brandon?

18:59.399 --> 19:00.443
- Yeah, Simon?

19:01.314 --> 19:03.359
- It's nice to put a face with
name.

19:03.403 --> 19:04.491
- Ditto.
- Pleasure.

19:06.232 --> 19:07.450
Thank you.
- Come on in.

19:08.973 --> 19:10.192
- But this time I swear, I mean

19:10.236 --> 19:11.933
Megan is being completely
unreasonable,

19:11.976 --> 19:13.413
I mean we would have arguments
some time

19:13.456 --> 19:17.199
but like stupid little
arguments, you know.

19:17.243 --> 19:19.375
Like leaving your spit in the
sink

19:19.419 --> 19:20.898
instead of rinsing it out.

19:20.942 --> 19:24.467
- Yeah, no me and my
fiancee have the same fight,

19:24.511 --> 19:26.861
I think that's just part
of a healthy relationship.

19:26.904 --> 19:28.428
- You said fiancee.

19:28.471 --> 19:30.212
- Yeah I did say fiancee.
- Wow.

19:36.697 --> 19:39.569
- If you come right here
to the left actually

19:39.613 --> 19:42.529
we just finished a lot of this.

19:42.572 --> 19:44.966
- I love it, love it.

19:45.009 --> 19:46.576
- You've got some style I see it
there.

19:46.620 --> 19:48.709
- Yeah I was actually listening
to a podcast that explained

19:48.752 --> 19:50.189
how green is like an energy
color

19:50.232 --> 19:52.669
so it kind of gives you
a little extra, you know.

19:52.713 --> 19:54.410
And then some cool masks we did,

19:54.454 --> 19:55.759
this was kind of my favorite
spot.

19:55.803 --> 19:56.847
- Awesome.

19:56.891 --> 19:58.371
- Some of the shells actually we
did

19:58.414 --> 20:00.242
a little trip to Hawaii not too
long ago

20:00.286 --> 20:01.417
so it was nice.

20:01.461 --> 20:02.462
- Nice, beautiful.
- And I brought some

20:02.505 --> 20:03.724
some stuff back, just memory.

20:03.767 --> 20:05.334
Oh and, kitchen let me
show you real quick.

20:05.378 --> 20:09.773
I did, we have this thing
about directions it's so weird.

20:09.817 --> 20:12.776
But anyway so we did some
green throughout 'cause

20:12.820 --> 20:15.475
I thought it would just
kind of pop, you know.

20:15.518 --> 20:18.304
And of course, the beautiful
Steph.

20:18.347 --> 20:20.262
- So now that I know
that you have a fiancee

20:20.306 --> 20:22.656
and you know a little bit about
me,

20:22.699 --> 20:24.179
well if you don't mind me
stalking you,

20:24.223 --> 20:26.007
can I find you on social media?

20:26.050 --> 20:28.531
- Oh, yeah, Brandon Scott.

20:29.532 --> 20:32.231
- Scott, that's a neat name, I
like that.

20:32.274 --> 20:33.449
- Yeah thank you.

20:33.493 --> 20:35.756
- Have a seat, Simon.
- Hi, how are you.

20:35.799 --> 20:36.626
- Thank you.

20:39.020 --> 20:40.848
- Thank you so much for coming.

20:40.891 --> 20:42.545
- Thank you for having me.

20:42.589 --> 20:44.852
- I know it's a pain to
come to the house so I

20:44.895 --> 20:46.245
appreciate it
- I have no problem

20:46.288 --> 20:48.029
making house calls, trust
me, it's totally fine.

20:48.072 --> 20:49.552
- Thank you.

20:49.596 --> 20:52.381
- I know you may feel
nervous, I want you to know

20:52.425 --> 20:55.297
that I'm gonna help guide
you through everything, okay?

20:55.341 --> 20:57.386
- Yeah.
- Good.

20:57.430 --> 20:59.127
- What's her name by the way?

20:59.170 --> 21:00.215
- Steph.

21:00.259 --> 21:01.695
- That's nice, what is your
favorite

21:01.738 --> 21:02.652
thing about Steph?

21:04.263 --> 21:07.788
- I've always been
aimless, relatively aimless

21:07.831 --> 21:10.921
in my life and I think she
identified

21:10.965 --> 21:14.316
that in me pretty quickly and so
she's

21:14.360 --> 21:19.103
able to kind of steer me
or help me steer myself,

21:19.147 --> 21:20.931
it's definitely not a control
thing

21:20.975 --> 21:23.325
like she's just able to kind of
feel

21:23.369 --> 21:27.460
who I am and help me
find how to get there.

21:27.503 --> 21:32.465
- So let's start with a few
pictures of wedding cakes.

21:33.596 --> 21:34.423
- Great.

21:35.772 --> 21:36.599
- Yeah.

21:38.166 --> 21:38.949
- Favorite color is blue.

21:43.780 --> 21:44.694
- Brandon.

21:50.265 --> 21:51.179
Brandon loves chocolate.

21:51.222 --> 21:53.442
She loves the color blue.

21:53.486 --> 21:55.226
- Chocolate and blue.

21:55.270 --> 21:56.793
- Yeah.

21:56.837 --> 22:00.406
- Okay guys, look I understand
what's going on here.

22:05.411 --> 22:07.543
This is a big step.

22:10.503 --> 22:12.983
- You guys have some really cute
photos.

22:13.027 --> 22:16.378
- Yeah, yeah we try and be
creative.

22:16.422 --> 22:19.076
- There are like a list of
photos here

22:19.120 --> 22:21.601
where neither of you are
smiling.

22:21.644 --> 22:23.864
- The Hawaii ones?
- I don't know.

22:24.995 --> 22:27.128
- Yeah that was, we took a trip
to Hawaii

22:27.171 --> 22:29.565
and now we're saving up
to go to Machu Pichu.

22:29.609 --> 22:31.524
We like to go to really
beautiful places

22:31.567 --> 22:34.614
and take pictures looking
as miserable as possible.

22:36.355 --> 22:40.271
- So have you all thought
about a destination wedding?

22:42.317 --> 22:44.319
- We thought about escaping
somewhere to

22:45.233 --> 22:47.235
not have to deal with family.

22:47.278 --> 22:48.889
- An escape is good.
- Right.

22:48.932 --> 22:50.978
- It's very very manageable
and not as expensive

22:51.021 --> 22:52.109
as you would think.

22:52.153 --> 22:55.722
Any places in mind, beach,
outdoors?

22:56.549 --> 22:59.943
- You know everything that I
love so.

22:59.987 --> 23:01.989
- She has mentioned Machu Pichu
once.

23:02.032 --> 23:03.425
That's a possibility but that's
a

23:03.469 --> 23:04.818
little more expensive sometimes.

23:04.861 --> 23:08.604
- Let's see if we have
anything lined up inside.

23:11.520 --> 23:13.087
- Oh yeah she is a little cutie,

23:13.130 --> 23:14.697
you guys are adorable together.

23:14.741 --> 23:16.003
- Oh thank you thank you.

23:16.046 --> 23:18.571
- You've made me a huge
admirer of your life.

23:18.614 --> 23:20.268
- Let me show you all a few
options

23:20.311 --> 23:22.270
that way we can get an
understanding of what you may like.

23:22.313 --> 23:24.794
- You know what, Simon let me
stop you

23:24.838 --> 23:28.145
for a second, we have been so
rude,

23:28.189 --> 23:30.104
we did not offer you anything to
drink.

23:30.147 --> 23:33.716
Are you thirsty, I'm
actually really thirsty

23:33.760 --> 23:35.805
I would love some more water, if
possible.

23:35.849 --> 23:37.459
- Do you want some water.

23:37.503 --> 23:39.069
- Sure, I'll take a glass of
water.

23:39.113 --> 23:40.157
- Sure, ice?

23:40.201 --> 23:41.420
- Ice water's fine, yes.

23:43.987 --> 23:47.164
- Maybe some lemon in
mine too would be great.

23:47.208 --> 23:48.949
- Yeah and here I'll
actually take the plates.

23:48.992 --> 23:51.473
- In the mean time I'll
just show her some things

23:51.517 --> 23:53.475
and wait for your opinion
when you get back.

23:53.519 --> 23:54.389
- For sure.

23:55.651 --> 23:58.306
- Okay, so this kind
of what I was thinking.

23:58.349 --> 24:00.656
- Simon, that's not Brandon.

24:01.744 --> 24:04.660
Listen to me, look under the
table.

24:05.705 --> 24:07.707
You've got to get me out of
here.

24:07.750 --> 24:10.100
Simon you need to call the
police.

24:10.144 --> 24:12.059
- Yeah, let me show
some photos on my phone,

24:12.102 --> 24:14.714
that way maybe we can get a
better idea.

24:14.757 --> 24:16.193
- Come on, hurry.

24:17.499 --> 24:18.544
- I'm trying.

24:19.806 --> 24:21.024
- Just hurry up.
- What some type of

24:21.068 --> 24:22.461
destination or place you.

24:26.377 --> 24:28.684
- Fuzzy, look what you did.

24:54.536 --> 24:55.450
- I love you.

25:08.681 --> 25:11.379
- Where are we actually going?

25:11.422 --> 25:13.163
I'm just driving, I mean I feel
bad

25:13.207 --> 25:15.035
that we're just driving around.

25:15.078 --> 25:17.254
- It's fine really, I really
don't

25:17.298 --> 25:19.082
have anywhere specific to go.

25:19.126 --> 25:20.823
- But this is on your
dime, I mean you're paying

25:20.867 --> 25:22.564
by the mile and the minute right
now,

25:22.608 --> 25:23.696
like I feel bad.

25:23.739 --> 25:26.612
- I really just don't want to be
home so.

25:26.655 --> 25:29.136
- I'm sorry, if I'm talking too
much

25:29.179 --> 25:30.354
just let me know.

25:31.181 --> 25:34.184
- No you're fine, hell
do you have anywhere

25:34.228 --> 25:35.055
you want to go?

25:37.448 --> 25:41.191
- I mean yeah, I've got a place
that I go

25:42.149 --> 25:43.933
when I just need to think.

25:43.977 --> 25:47.371
- I like it, let's check it out
then.

25:47.415 --> 25:49.025
- Sure, that sounds good.

26:48.519 --> 26:50.521
- This is really nice.

26:50.565 --> 26:51.653
- Yeah.

26:51.697 --> 26:53.133
- And the water's almost like
glass.

26:53.176 --> 26:54.656
- Yep.

26:54.700 --> 26:56.223
- How did you find this place?

26:57.224 --> 26:58.660
- When you drive for a living

26:58.704 --> 27:02.185
you find a lot of random hidden
spaces.

27:02.229 --> 27:03.056
- Fair enough.

27:04.623 --> 27:06.320
Did you drop someone off
that lived in a boat.

27:06.363 --> 27:07.669
- I actually did.

27:07.713 --> 27:08.801
- Well I'll be damned look at
that.

27:08.844 --> 27:10.324
- Weird as that sounds and I was
like,

27:10.367 --> 27:12.282
"so how do you get your mail?"

27:13.632 --> 27:14.894
He said it just goes to the dock

27:14.937 --> 27:17.766
it wasn't a very climactic
story.

27:17.810 --> 27:19.768
- It's nice though, it's good.

27:19.812 --> 27:21.117
- This is the closest thing I
can

27:21.161 --> 27:24.338
find in the city to complete
silence,

27:24.381 --> 27:29.386
so if you need to let
anything breathe, breathe.

27:30.692 --> 27:34.609
- So earlier, maybe I wasn't as
truthful

27:35.523 --> 27:37.090
as I should've been about Megan.

27:39.658 --> 27:42.791
But you know we're real friends
now,

27:42.835 --> 27:44.227
you've shown me your spot.

27:44.271 --> 27:46.142
- We're no longer in a URYDE
car.

27:46.186 --> 27:49.624
Well Megan found this
dating app on my phone

27:49.668 --> 27:53.454
and I met this guy out for a
drink,

27:53.497 --> 27:57.588
it wasn't like a date, I
mean not really you know.

27:57.632 --> 28:00.069
Well yeah, okay it was a date.

28:00.113 --> 28:02.115
It was a date at that point.
- Yeah sounds like a date.

28:02.158 --> 28:03.420
- Goddammit.

28:03.464 --> 28:07.294
So I met him out and he
was really a nice guy

28:07.337 --> 28:10.471
I mean just interesting
and we chatted for a while.

28:11.472 --> 28:14.127
And it started getting closer to

28:18.784 --> 28:21.569
literally seconds before we
touched lips

28:21.612 --> 28:24.224
I froze up because all I could
think about

28:24.267 --> 28:26.705
was Megan and what it would do
to her.

28:29.620 --> 28:33.189
I guess I came to the
realization that I

28:34.321 --> 28:36.758
shouldn't throw away something
this good

28:36.802 --> 28:38.934
just to try something different.

28:38.978 --> 28:42.851
- Yeah, it sounds like you have

28:44.592 --> 28:47.900
like an innate curiosity but
that you

28:47.943 --> 28:52.948
still feel an overwhelming
drive to be with her.

28:55.298 --> 28:58.040
But kind of like you're not
ready to commit yet, maybe.

29:00.564 --> 29:02.871
- You've got a way with words,
mate.

29:02.915 --> 29:04.394
You should start writing or
something.

29:04.438 --> 29:06.005
- Thank you, thank you.

29:06.048 --> 29:08.398
- Or giving relationship
advice, whichever one.

29:09.443 --> 29:11.097
I don't know I mean it feels

29:13.142 --> 29:15.101
you make me feel better about
it,

29:15.144 --> 29:17.538
like I don't know.

29:19.670 --> 29:22.499
Maybe I should go tonight.

29:23.849 --> 29:26.895
- Alright, progress, baby steps.

29:26.939 --> 29:31.900
- Yeah, I mean if all
else we figure it out.

29:32.640 --> 29:34.773
We're not wasting our time for
me

29:34.816 --> 29:36.557
to figure out whatever
the hell I want to do.

29:36.600 --> 29:39.473
- That's a big step.

29:42.171 --> 29:42.998
- Okay.

29:46.567 --> 29:48.656
- Shall we go tackle the beast?

29:50.353 --> 29:51.790
- I don't know if I'd call,

29:52.791 --> 29:53.835
if I call Megan a beast--

29:53.879 --> 29:55.228
- I wasn't calling Megan a
beast.

29:55.271 --> 29:57.621
- Well you kind of said tackle
the beast.

29:57.665 --> 29:59.754
- The situation is a beast.

29:59.798 --> 30:01.451
- Okay.
- The scenario's a beast.

30:01.495 --> 30:04.846
- Do you ever tell Steph, hey
let's go tackle the beast?

30:04.890 --> 30:06.630
- I do, it means a very
different thing in that.

30:06.674 --> 30:08.807
- Jesus, alright, I'll
meet you at the car.

30:08.850 --> 30:09.720
You're gonna finish up whatever

30:09.764 --> 30:11.592
you're doing out here, nasty.

30:11.635 --> 30:12.462
- Okay.

30:18.686 --> 30:21.123
- Look see here we go already.

30:21.167 --> 30:24.039
She is coming back texting me
again about,

30:25.911 --> 30:30.872
well I'm gonna tell her that
I would like to come see her.

30:33.875 --> 30:37.792
- Yeah, I think that's what we
do.

30:37.836 --> 30:39.750
I think that's the next step.

30:41.361 --> 30:42.710
- Alright, said aye alright.

30:42.753 --> 30:46.279
She said, I'm welcome to come
over.

30:46.322 --> 30:47.149
Alright so.

30:50.065 --> 30:50.892
Okay.

30:52.372 --> 30:53.242
- Do you feel good about it?

30:53.286 --> 30:55.418
- Yeah, I do really.
- Good.

30:55.462 --> 30:57.116
- Because of you mate, thank
you.

30:58.204 --> 30:59.596
Yeah.

30:59.640 --> 31:00.467
- Absolutely.

31:04.384 --> 31:05.515
I think it got weird there.

31:05.559 --> 31:06.734
- No.

31:06.777 --> 31:07.778
- It got weird a little bit.

31:07.822 --> 31:09.606
- No weird is like, that's
weird.

31:10.956 --> 31:12.435
- This is a fast friendship.

31:12.479 --> 31:13.959
- That's friendship right there.

31:14.002 --> 31:15.917
- Fast friendship right there.

31:15.961 --> 31:20.139
That's pretty, I think I
don't know if I've ever gotten

31:21.357 --> 31:22.750
not to use the word close,

31:22.793 --> 31:24.056
but I don't think I've ever
gotten--

31:24.099 --> 31:25.144
- Inserted.

31:25.187 --> 31:26.101
- Well okay.

31:30.149 --> 31:32.629
I feel like you should bring her
a gift.

31:32.673 --> 31:36.938
- Okay, what about, what about

31:39.332 --> 31:40.507
- Champagne?

31:40.550 --> 31:42.378
- No no she's not really like a
champagne.

31:43.771 --> 31:45.120
- Chocolate.

31:45.164 --> 31:47.514
- She loves chocolate but
I don't know if like--

31:47.557 --> 31:50.734
- It is almost three in the
morning.

31:50.778 --> 31:52.432
- Yeah I don't know if
she's gonna appreciate

31:52.475 --> 31:53.650
like a Snickers bar.

31:53.694 --> 31:54.738
- I don't know if we're gonna
find that.

31:54.782 --> 31:56.001
Yeah, from a gas station.

31:58.481 --> 32:00.222
- What about--

32:00.266 --> 32:01.093
- Flowers.

32:02.572 --> 32:03.878
- She does like flowers.
- She does?

32:03.922 --> 32:05.010
- She does like flowers.

32:05.053 --> 32:06.968
- Okay, okay.

32:07.012 --> 32:10.972
- So flower shops stay open til
3 AM-ish

32:11.016 --> 32:12.800
most of the time or did
you know somewhere that--

32:12.843 --> 32:17.674
- No I was thinking we steal
some flowers.

32:17.718 --> 32:19.676
- You want to go steal flowers.

32:20.503 --> 32:22.505
- I was thinking about it.

32:22.549 --> 32:23.942
- From where?

32:23.985 --> 32:26.205
- What are you doing with your
face.

32:26.248 --> 32:27.597
- This is my devious face.

32:27.641 --> 32:29.556
- You can't make that face
if you're gonna do it.

32:29.599 --> 32:33.560
- It's my devious face not
my relationship helper face.

32:33.603 --> 32:34.865
- What is the--

32:34.909 --> 32:35.605
- I have a completely
different face for that.

32:35.649 --> 32:37.042
- Show me that one.

32:40.523 --> 32:42.569
Let's just stick with the
flowers.

32:44.527 --> 32:47.878
Do you usually bring
Stephanie flowers when--

32:47.922 --> 32:49.968
- I think that Steph probably
gives me

32:50.011 --> 32:52.318
some pity smiles because she
probably

32:52.361 --> 32:57.192
prefers something else but
she's always fine with them

32:57.236 --> 33:00.021
I mean she's happy, it's
the thought that counts.

33:00.065 --> 33:00.891
What?

33:01.892 --> 33:02.981
- I was just--
- What?

33:03.024 --> 33:07.507
- I was just enjoying how both
of you

33:07.550 --> 33:11.337
settle for shit if the other
one's happy.

33:13.643 --> 33:16.690
- I guess that's the sign
of a good relationship.

33:16.733 --> 33:20.476
- So flowers, flowers.

33:21.695 --> 33:25.177
Omelets with avocado and kale.

33:27.570 --> 33:30.530
Favorite color is blue, what
does she do for a living?

33:30.573 --> 33:32.010
Did you tell me that?

33:32.053 --> 33:35.143
- She's a psychology major.

33:35.187 --> 33:36.666
- Oh wow, alright.
- Yeah.

33:37.928 --> 33:39.191
- And she's smart, I like that.

33:39.234 --> 33:41.932
- Yes, oh yes, very smart.

33:41.976 --> 33:43.543
Smarter than me probably.

33:44.631 --> 33:46.111
What is your plan?

33:46.154 --> 33:48.243
- Now it is get flowers.

33:48.287 --> 33:52.769
- Right, flowers are good,
how do you explain the app.

33:52.813 --> 33:55.468
- I'm hoping that if I can
explain

33:55.511 --> 33:58.079
to her what I explained to you,

33:58.123 --> 34:00.734
I realized that I didn't want to
lose her

34:00.777 --> 34:02.866
because of how important she--

34:02.910 --> 34:04.433
- Nailed it.

34:04.477 --> 34:06.783
- I thought, like start with
how important she is, right?

34:06.827 --> 34:08.089
- Yes, nailed it.

34:08.132 --> 34:10.831
- Yeah, because when I
was explaining it to you

34:10.873 --> 34:13.138
I really didn't hesitate, well
I hesitated for a little bit

34:13.181 --> 34:14.878
because it's kind of scary
telling

34:14.922 --> 34:18.491
a complete stranger that
you have a gay dating app

34:18.534 --> 34:21.014
on your phone and went on a
date.

34:21.059 --> 34:23.364
- I hey man, to each their own,

34:23.409 --> 34:26.107
I am not on this planet to judge
people.

34:26.150 --> 34:28.239
- Well that's fantastic but I
have not

34:28.283 --> 34:30.068
been in a committed relationship
with you

34:30.110 --> 34:31.460
and I'm not bringing you flowers

34:31.504 --> 34:34.985
that my URYDE driver stole
out of someone's yard.

34:48.521 --> 34:50.217
- This is my URYDE protection,

34:50.262 --> 34:53.134
Steph insists I keep it in here.

34:53.178 --> 34:53.960
Come on.

34:54.004 --> 34:54.831
- Alright.

34:59.445 --> 35:00.794
Do you really need a knife.

35:02.230 --> 35:05.712
Alright, okay I guess
we're really doing this.

35:05.755 --> 35:08.236
- Are you gonna, am I doing
this by myself or what?

35:08.280 --> 35:09.542
- What is that, what are these
things?

35:09.585 --> 35:12.458
- I don't know I didn't take
botany.

35:15.852 --> 35:17.027
- Save that one.

35:18.551 --> 35:19.465
It looks like--

35:22.511 --> 35:26.036
Yeah well she does like
purple and that's purple

35:26.080 --> 35:26.994
so that's actually.

35:28.648 --> 35:29.475
- Here.

35:31.085 --> 35:32.565
- She's gonna love this and
looks

35:32.608 --> 35:34.523
just like you bought it from a
store.

35:34.567 --> 35:35.742
She's never gonna know.

35:38.614 --> 35:40.225
- I don't think you're
supposed to eat the flowers.

35:40.268 --> 35:41.139
- It's Kale.

35:43.532 --> 35:44.664
That's really good Kale.

35:44.707 --> 35:46.622
- Should I bring Megan a
smoothie?

35:46.666 --> 35:49.495
- That's good, this is a good
one.

35:58.591 --> 35:59.374
That's pretty.

35:59.418 --> 36:00.245
- It is very pretty.

36:01.159 --> 36:02.421
- That light just come on?

36:11.560 --> 36:13.649
- And then we just disappear

36:13.693 --> 36:15.869
into the cover of night and
nobody

36:15.912 --> 36:17.914
even knows we were here.

36:50.643 --> 36:51.513
- Thank you.

36:51.557 --> 36:52.688
- I'm nervous for you.

36:54.037 --> 36:54.864
Is this the place?

36:54.908 --> 36:55.735
- This is it.

36:57.040 --> 36:58.128
I've got my flowers.

36:58.172 --> 37:00.870
- Flowers in hand.
- That was an and.

37:00.914 --> 37:05.484
And I guess this is
where we slay the beast?

37:05.527 --> 37:06.572
- Tackle.
- Tackle the beast.

37:06.615 --> 37:08.791
This is where we tackle the
beast.

37:08.835 --> 37:10.010
- Yeah.

37:10.053 --> 37:12.142
- Yeah slaying is something else
isn't it.

37:12.186 --> 37:13.753
- Yeah.

37:13.796 --> 37:14.971
- Alright.
- You okay?

37:15.015 --> 37:16.277
- Yeah I think so.

37:16.321 --> 37:17.800
- Is this the end of our road?

37:19.759 --> 37:21.369
Do I finally end trip?

37:22.631 --> 37:24.154
- Actually let's do this here.

37:26.809 --> 37:27.636
Twenty.

37:28.550 --> 37:30.204
Thank you, okay.

37:30.248 --> 37:31.553
- Yeah absolutely.
- You've been fantastic.

37:31.597 --> 37:32.685
- Thank you.

37:32.728 --> 37:34.556
- Alright, I'm gonna make this
happen.

37:36.515 --> 37:37.342
- Do I wait?

37:39.082 --> 37:41.476
- If this goes well, I get to
move back

37:41.520 --> 37:44.436
into my own home, if it does not

37:44.479 --> 37:46.525
I will be back here I guess.

37:46.568 --> 37:49.092
- Okay, how long do I wait?

37:51.356 --> 37:52.182
- Twenty.

38:53.766 --> 38:56.203
Fuck, fucking hell.

39:01.121 --> 39:01.948
Shit.

39:05.473 --> 39:09.477
Shit shit fucking hell.

39:09.521 --> 39:11.000
Why the fuck would she do that?

39:14.439 --> 39:15.309
Fuck.

39:49.604 --> 39:50.431
We can go.

39:54.479 --> 39:59.484
- Okay.

40:12.366 --> 40:13.149
You okay?

40:13.193 --> 40:14.629
- Yeah, yeah I'm fine.

40:24.378 --> 40:27.555
- So you broke up?

40:29.992 --> 40:31.385
- Yeah I mean I just--

40:37.522 --> 40:39.001
- But I mean that's okay right,

40:39.045 --> 40:40.220
I mean that's okay that's--

40:40.263 --> 40:42.091
- I don't know I don't know if
it's okay

40:42.135 --> 40:44.877
because I don't know that
that's what I wanted to do

40:44.920 --> 40:50.012
in the first place and I don't
know if.

40:50.056 --> 40:52.275
I need a fucking drink is what I
need,

40:52.319 --> 40:53.494
I need a drink.
- Done.

41:12.557 --> 41:14.036
- What?

41:14.080 --> 41:15.473
- I'm buying them for you.
- You're not buying my beer.

41:15.516 --> 41:17.475
- I'm buying these for you,
it's the least I can do.

41:19.346 --> 41:21.087
How's your night going?

41:21.130 --> 41:21.914
- Good, how are you?

41:21.957 --> 41:23.437
- Wonderful, thank you.

41:25.221 --> 41:26.658
- Just swipe your card there,
please.

41:26.701 --> 41:27.528
- Yes, sir.

41:33.273 --> 41:34.492
- Your beers.

41:34.535 --> 41:36.232
- Your beer, you keep that one.

41:37.277 --> 41:40.498
- I'm gonna jump in the
back, charge my phone up.

41:40.541 --> 41:41.629
That fine with you?

41:41.673 --> 41:44.719
- Yeah, I can't drive with this.

41:44.763 --> 41:45.590
- Yeah you can.

41:51.204 --> 41:52.901
- So where are we headed?

41:52.945 --> 41:54.642
Should I just take you
back to your buddy's

41:54.686 --> 41:55.817
where I picked you up?

42:02.998 --> 42:03.825
Judd?

42:05.610 --> 42:06.567
- Yeah, that's fine.

42:11.964 --> 42:13.487
- Want to talk about anything

42:13.531 --> 42:15.533
that happened at Megan's house.

42:15.576 --> 42:17.709
Kind of interested to know what
that was.

42:21.408 --> 42:23.323
- I don't really want to talk
about it.

42:35.857 --> 42:37.903
- I mean, I'd look at it this
way.

42:38.947 --> 42:41.210
You can go on whatever
kind of date you want to,

42:41.254 --> 42:44.170
with whoever you want to now.

42:44.213 --> 42:45.693
I mean, when you got in the car

42:45.737 --> 42:47.086
you barely knew whether you
wanted

42:47.129 --> 42:49.262
the relationship to work or not.

42:49.305 --> 42:52.570
So you know silver lining.

42:58.053 --> 42:59.533
- You're not from here, right?

43:01.317 --> 43:02.144
- No.

43:03.668 --> 43:05.017
- Where are you from?

43:05.060 --> 43:05.887
- Wyoming.

43:07.672 --> 43:09.108
- Talk to your parents often?

43:12.415 --> 43:16.855
- No, maybe three four
times a year at this point.

43:20.554 --> 43:22.687
- What was it you said
you called your lady?

43:25.864 --> 43:28.170
- Ms. Fuzz, or Fuzzy.

43:31.130 --> 43:32.087
It's funny, right?

43:34.263 --> 43:35.090
- Yeah.

43:40.008 --> 43:41.836
- You want me to turn the
radio on or something?

43:41.880 --> 43:45.623
I feel like you just kind
of want me to shut up.

43:46.580 --> 43:51.585
- Yeah, I like the silence.

47:20.794 --> 47:22.317
- The key to making
a perfect kale omelet

47:22.361 --> 47:23.884
is to keep the temperature low.

49:23.873 --> 49:25.701
- Shirt. Open shirt.

49:29.618 --> 49:31.446
That's good. Stop.

49:33.318 --> 49:34.667
Stop it.

Do you want me to feed you?

01:01:13.234 --> 01:01:15.062
- Just really worried about you.

01:01:16.629 --> 01:01:18.196
Came home and hopped in the
shower

01:01:18.239 --> 01:01:23.331
and got all the drunken
passenger stink off of me.

01:01:23.375 --> 01:01:25.638
And then when I climbed in bed,

01:01:35.604 --> 01:01:36.693
I just helped you back in bed

01:01:36.736 --> 01:01:38.346
and let you try to sleep it off.

01:01:40.131 --> 01:01:43.308
Then I got you up and got
you dressed for the day.

01:01:43.351 --> 01:01:45.353
It's one of my favorite sweaters
on you.

01:01:56.060 --> 01:01:59.150
- Does my omelet have any salt
on it?

01:02:00.368 --> 01:02:01.630
- So stupid.

01:02:02.936 --> 01:02:04.633
Do you want me to get some?

01:02:04.677 --> 01:02:06.287
- Yeah.
- Yeah, okay.

01:02:24.653 --> 01:02:25.611
What are you doing?

01:02:33.924 --> 01:02:36.100
- I was just looking
at this picture of us.

01:02:37.754 --> 01:02:40.539
- Yeah, no it's just one of
my favorite pictures of us.

01:02:44.543 --> 01:02:47.111
- I don't remember where we took
it.

01:02:47.154 --> 01:02:48.982
- It was in Hawaii babe, on
vacation.

01:02:50.288 --> 01:02:52.464
- Guess I hit my head
harder than I thought.

01:03:04.128 --> 01:03:05.042
- Tell me when.

01:03:06.391 --> 01:03:07.522

Take a bite.

01:03:29.718 --> 01:03:30.545
- Okay.

01:03:36.247 --> 01:03:37.378
- Is it good?

01:03:40.512 --> 01:03:42.035
- Sorry, my head just hurts.

01:03:47.040 --> 01:03:48.825
Can I have some water, sorry.

01:03:48.868 --> 01:03:49.695

01:05:06.598 --> 01:05:08.905
- I can't believe we did that.

01:05:08.948 --> 01:05:10.341
- I didn't mean to make you do
that

01:05:10.384 --> 01:05:12.299
I didn't mean to make

01:05:12.343 --> 01:05:16.651
- It's okay, I mean he was
really nice.

01:05:16.695 --> 01:05:17.914

Better baby?

01:08:19.573 --> 01:08:22.533
- What did you do yesterday?

01:08:22.576 --> 01:08:25.448
- Drove most night, I didn't go
as late

01:08:25.492 --> 01:08:27.929
as I normally do though, it was
like

01:08:27.973 --> 01:08:29.975
somewhat busy but you know once
the fare

01:08:30.018 --> 01:08:31.323
started getting really high
everybody

01:08:31.368 --> 01:08:33.587
kind of backed off even more.

01:08:33.631 --> 01:08:35.546
- Did you pick up anybody
interesting?

01:08:36.590 --> 01:08:38.505
- Yeah, there was one
guy that was kind of.

01:08:38.549 --> 01:08:40.464
He was funny, like you know?

01:08:44.859 --> 01:08:47.122
- Where did you pick that guy
up?

01:08:47.166 --> 01:08:49.125
- I don't remember the exact,
specific

01:08:49.167 --> 01:08:50.430
location but you know.

01:08:50.474 --> 01:08:52.127
- What was his name?

01:08:52.171 --> 01:08:53.694
- Derek, I think.
- Derek?

01:08:53.738 --> 01:08:57.002
- Yeah, he was nice, you know.

01:08:58.350 --> 01:08:59.831
- Anybody not nice?

01:09:00.832 --> 01:09:01.658
- No.

01:09:43.265 --> 01:09:46.006
- It was not what it looked
like, I was just saying hi.

01:09:50.621 --> 01:09:52.362
Will you look at me please
Brandon?

01:09:55.930 --> 01:09:57.193
It is not what you thought it
was,

01:09:57.236 --> 01:09:59.934
I was just saying hi to
the little boy, okay.

01:09:59.978 --> 01:10:01.632
- Just don't.

01:10:04.243 --> 01:10:05.244
- Where are we going?

01:10:06.637 --> 01:10:07.812
- I thought we were gonna
go get something to eat

01:10:07.855 --> 01:10:10.249
we're gonna go get something to
eat, okay.

01:10:10.293 --> 01:10:11.119
You okay?

01:10:11.163 --> 01:10:11.990
- Babe, don't.

01:10:16.168 --> 01:10:17.213
- Where are we going?

01:10:23.915 --> 01:10:25.699
Talk to me, where are you taking
me?

01:10:32.532 --> 01:10:34.621
Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa.

01:10:40.061 --> 01:10:40.888
Hey.

01:10:45.241 --> 01:10:46.372
I was just saying hi to that
little boy.

01:10:46.416 --> 01:10:50.985
- Just stop, I'd rather just get
home

01:10:51.029 --> 01:10:52.335
'cause I know you're not
feeling so well today.

01:10:52.378 --> 01:10:56.861
- No, I'm fine, I'm fine,
I feel completely okay.

01:11:00.256 --> 01:11:02.214
- Let's just go to the
house for right now,

01:11:02.258 --> 01:11:04.521
get you some water you
can relax for a second.

01:11:05.957 --> 01:11:07.393
- I thought we were gonna go to
the spot,

01:11:07.437 --> 01:11:08.568
that would make me--

01:11:08.612 --> 01:11:09.439
- Stop.

01:11:19.231 --> 01:11:21.146
- Hey, hey, help, help.

01:11:24.410 --> 01:11:25.281
- Yo, yo.

01:11:29.154 --> 01:11:30.242
Hey, hold on.

01:13:19.786 --> 01:13:20.613

Oh god.

01:14:06.180 --> 01:14:11.185
I swear I'll do what you tell me
to do.

01:14:20.194 --> 01:14:21.979
- I don't want to kill you.

01:14:22.022 --> 01:14:25.809
- You don't have to, you don't
have to

01:14:25.852 --> 01:14:28.115
I will be good I swear.

01:14:30.640 --> 01:14:31.467
I swear.

01:15:04.935 --> 01:15:07.503
- You're gonna make this fun,

01:15:07.938 --> 01:15:09.505
Yeah, baby.
