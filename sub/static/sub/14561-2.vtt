WEBVTT

00:00.834 --> 00:03.737
("Timebomb" by Beck playing)

00:12.813 --> 00:16.417
* We got a time bomb,
we got a time bomb *

00:16.450 --> 00:19.387
* We got a time bomb
* Na na-na na *

00:19.420 --> 00:22.256
* We got a warning light,
we got a warning light *

00:22.290 --> 00:25.826
* We pull the plug out and we
* Na na-na na *

00:25.859 --> 00:28.829
* Time bomb ticking,
time bomb ticking *

00:28.862 --> 00:30.598
* It's a time bomb ticking

00:30.631 --> 00:32.600
* Going tick, tick, tick, tick

00:34.635 --> 00:37.771
* We got a time bomb,
we got a time bomb *

00:37.805 --> 00:41.709
* We got a time bomb
* Na na-na na *

00:41.742 --> 00:45.613
* We pull the plug out and we
* Na na-na na... *

00:45.646 --> 00:46.847
My CI's confirmed
Wilson's crew will be

00:46.880 --> 00:49.417
hitting the downtown branch
of the Golden Bear Mutual Bank.

00:49.450 --> 00:51.185
GORDON: We have an address
where he's staying?

00:51.219 --> 00:52.353
Don't care about that.

00:52.386 --> 00:53.754
You're
going to let him hit the bank?

00:53.787 --> 00:55.022
FOX: We wait to catch Wilson
on his way out,

00:55.055 --> 00:57.358
once he has the money,
and we put that bastard away

00:57.391 --> 00:59.127
for the rest of his life.
It's not my first rodeo.

00:59.160 --> 01:01.095
Let's go.

01:06.367 --> 01:07.835
All right, wait,
wait, wait, wait.

01:07.868 --> 01:09.737
Just about here. Yeah.

01:09.770 --> 01:14.475
Now, above us lies
the office of Professor Elliot.

01:14.508 --> 01:16.810
Uh, so, in principle,
we have succeeded.

01:16.844 --> 01:19.580
Actually, in a much more
realistic way, we have failed.

01:19.613 --> 01:21.782
Can't we get campus security
to unlock the building?

01:21.815 --> 01:23.117
Absolutely not.

01:23.151 --> 01:24.585
Cal-Cal Sci tradition holds

01:24.618 --> 01:26.754
the only way
you can turn a paper in late

01:26.787 --> 01:28.522
is to make your way
through these tunnels

01:28.556 --> 01:30.158
and find a way
to your professor's office.

01:30.191 --> 01:32.326
Are you, uh, sure that
that compass of yours works?

01:32.360 --> 01:33.694
Yeah, it's the same technology

01:33.727 --> 01:36.230
used by Tyrolean miners
since the 15th century.

01:36.264 --> 01:37.598
Tyrolean, huh?

01:37.631 --> 01:39.367
Now I think I know where
all that yodeling comes from.

01:39.400 --> 01:40.668
- Help! Help!
- Yeah, okay.

01:40.701 --> 01:42.903
- Somebody!
- We're stuck down here!

01:42.936 --> 01:44.205
CHARLIE: All right, take it...
take it easy.

01:44.238 --> 01:44.905
Whoa.

01:44.938 --> 01:46.607
ALAN:
How did you find us?

01:46.640 --> 01:47.841
We've been following you
the whole time.

01:47.875 --> 01:49.343
LARRY:
Hey, thanks for the confidence.

01:49.377 --> 01:51.279
I remind you
I orbited the Earth

01:51.312 --> 01:54.848
15.7 times a day,
all in the right direction.

01:54.882 --> 01:56.884
No, not with him
as your copilot.

01:56.917 --> 01:59.220
This guy's gotten lost driving
back from the supermarket.

01:59.253 --> 02:01.455
So I once hung it up
in San Pedro. Big deal.

02:01.489 --> 02:02.823
Yeah, who among us hasn't?

02:09.763 --> 02:11.632
- What is all this?
- AMITA: Over the years,

02:11.665 --> 02:13.534
students have come down here
to express themselves.

02:14.668 --> 02:15.636
(someone whistles)

02:15.669 --> 02:17.271
CHARLIE: There's actually some

02:17.305 --> 02:19.273
amazing work on these walls.

02:19.307 --> 02:20.941
Recognize that monogram?

02:20.974 --> 02:22.310
"A.E."

02:22.343 --> 02:23.644
ALAN:
It's not Alan Eppes.

02:23.677 --> 02:24.812
CHARLIE:
It's Albert Einstein.

02:24.845 --> 02:26.714
Really?

02:29.783 --> 02:32.186
"L.F." Hey.

02:32.220 --> 02:33.587
- Is that you, Larry?
- Is that you?

02:33.621 --> 02:35.256
I didn't know you
did any work down here.

02:35.289 --> 02:37.191
Looks like 11-dimensional
supergravity.

02:37.225 --> 02:37.891
Hey, uh, let's go.

02:37.925 --> 02:39.293
You know, all this dust--

02:39.327 --> 02:40.961
I'm kind of getting
an asthma attack.

02:40.994 --> 02:42.696
You don't have asthma.

02:44.998 --> 02:45.866
NIKKI:
You're handsome.

02:45.899 --> 02:47.768
You got a good job.
There's no reason

02:47.801 --> 02:48.802
why you shouldn't have
a girlfriend.

02:48.836 --> 02:49.870
If you took as much
interest in your workload

02:49.903 --> 02:51.939
as you do my love life,
I think you'd have caught

02:51.972 --> 02:54.375
Bin Laden and D.B. Cooper
by now.

02:54.408 --> 02:56.877
A man can't have two wives.

02:56.910 --> 02:59.413
We're married to the job.

02:59.447 --> 03:00.614
That's what I'm talking about.

03:00.648 --> 03:02.616
Oh, so I'm not dedicated
to the FBI?

03:02.650 --> 03:03.984
Oh, you're dedicated,
all right.

03:04.017 --> 03:05.853
Especially since
it's the only place

03:05.886 --> 03:06.954
you can find yourself a date.

03:06.987 --> 03:07.821
Okay.

03:07.855 --> 03:09.257
Little sniper friend, Ian
Edgerton.

03:09.290 --> 03:10.157
(mimics gun firing)

03:10.190 --> 03:11.425
Hey, look,
there are plenty of doctors

03:11.459 --> 03:12.960
and lawyers
and movie producers

03:12.993 --> 03:14.695
just waiting for me
to return their calls.

03:14.728 --> 03:17.265
- Ditto.
- Ah, "ditto," my butt.

03:17.298 --> 03:19.233
Okay, all right.
You want to put your money

03:19.267 --> 03:20.568
- where your mouth is?
- DAVID: Bring it.

03:20.601 --> 03:21.402
Done.

03:21.435 --> 03:22.903
Friday night,
we meet for dinner.

03:22.936 --> 03:24.938
Bring your best and represent.

03:24.972 --> 03:27.641
Whoever shows up solo pays.

03:27.675 --> 03:29.243
Oh, I can taste
the filet mignon already.

03:29.277 --> 03:30.911
(David chuckling)

03:33.581 --> 03:35.283
Tell me you still
have that file

03:35.316 --> 03:37.651
on the Internet dating company
we busted last year.

03:37.685 --> 03:39.253
I'm bringing it up
right now, partner.

03:39.287 --> 03:41.221
(alarm ringing)

03:45.693 --> 03:47.628
FBI! Drop your weapons!

03:50.664 --> 03:51.965
(people screaming)

04:12.085 --> 04:14.021
(groans) Damn!

04:23.631 --> 04:25.499
Hey, any word from Liz?

04:25.533 --> 04:27.568
Yeah, stuck in San Fran.

04:27.601 --> 04:29.570
Defense got the trial delayed
another week.

04:29.603 --> 04:31.605
Drug dealers always have
the best lawyers.

04:31.639 --> 04:32.940
Hey, bank robbery in progress.

04:32.973 --> 04:34.442
SOG team is under heavy fire.

04:35.543 --> 04:37.010
(siren blips)

04:37.044 --> 04:38.846
(tires squeal)

04:41.882 --> 04:43.884
(automatic weapon firing)

04:43.917 --> 04:45.686
Guys, go right.
Nikki, come with me.

05:09.109 --> 05:12.012
(sirens approaching)

05:12.045 --> 05:14.615
Okay.

05:16.684 --> 05:18.619
Watch your backs!
We got a bogey on the loose!

05:20.754 --> 05:22.390
Yeah, this is Betancourt.

05:22.423 --> 05:23.691
We got multiple agents down.

05:23.724 --> 05:26.059
I need ambulances
at Third and Broadway.

05:26.093 --> 05:27.995
(sirens approaching)

05:37.170 --> 05:39.640
(indistinct radio transmission)

05:39.673 --> 05:41.642
(sirens wailing)

05:41.675 --> 05:43.577
(woman sobbing)

05:46.113 --> 05:47.781
Hale's wife?

05:47.815 --> 05:48.982
Saw it on TV.

05:52.553 --> 05:54.855
How's Gordon?

05:54.888 --> 05:56.724
(gasping)

05:56.757 --> 05:57.958
Surgery.

05:57.991 --> 05:59.960
Ryba?

06:01.128 --> 06:03.030
Geez.

06:03.063 --> 06:04.832
- Not him, too.
- Look, I didn't even know

06:04.865 --> 06:07.134
- you were here, man.
- Special Operations Group

06:07.167 --> 06:08.402
needed an offsite team

06:08.436 --> 06:10.003
to watch a heavy
bank robbery crew.

06:10.037 --> 06:11.972
We followed them up
from San Diego this morning.

06:12.005 --> 06:14.107
You got to get
to the hospital with that.

06:14.141 --> 06:15.943
I'll leave when they do.

06:17.210 --> 06:19.413
Jumped off quick, man.

06:19.447 --> 06:21.882
Hale and Ryba, they'd never been
in anything like this before.

06:21.915 --> 06:23.451
(groans)

06:37.698 --> 06:39.132
Go back up Ryba and Gordon!

06:39.166 --> 06:40.601
I'll cover you! Go, go!

06:51.479 --> 06:53.581
(automatic gunfire)
(distorted screaming)

06:55.248 --> 06:57.117
(groans)

06:59.219 --> 07:00.521
(gasping)

07:01.989 --> 07:04.191
Fugitive's name is Jim Wilson.

07:04.224 --> 07:07.127
He's violent, and he's good
at what he does.

07:07.160 --> 07:08.562
All right,
we'll catch him, Petey.

07:08.596 --> 07:09.196
Hey, screw catching him.

07:09.229 --> 07:10.964
Want him dead.

07:12.500 --> 07:14.434
Hey, Don.

07:15.969 --> 07:18.038
I found a trail of blood
by the Volvo.

07:18.071 --> 07:18.906
Oh, yeah?

07:18.939 --> 07:20.474
- Type?
- O-positive. Matches our boy.

07:20.508 --> 07:21.975
Same as a hundred million
other people.

07:22.009 --> 07:23.844
Yeah, a hundred million
other people didn't get shot

07:23.877 --> 07:25.479
with a .223 round this morning.

07:25.513 --> 07:26.914
I pulled this out of the wall
over there.

07:26.947 --> 07:28.248
All right, well, check
the hospitals. Bleed like that,

07:28.281 --> 07:30.183
you're going to have
to take care of fast.

07:30.217 --> 07:31.151
Okay.

07:31.184 --> 07:32.620
We got 20 witnesses,
20 different stories.

07:32.653 --> 07:33.987
Here's what we know for sure:

07:34.021 --> 07:36.490
three robbers, four FBI agents.

07:36.524 --> 07:37.925
They got two of ours,
we got two of theirs.

07:37.958 --> 07:39.493
- What about Wilson?
- COLBY: Some say he ran--

07:39.527 --> 07:40.761
others say he escaped by car--

07:40.794 --> 07:42.095
but he's definitely gone.

07:42.129 --> 07:43.797
Okay, get it out to LAPD.

07:43.831 --> 07:45.132
Anything with
the security cameras?

07:45.165 --> 07:46.867
Only one worked
because the bank's waiting

07:46.900 --> 07:49.136
on more bailout funds
to fix the other two.

07:49.169 --> 07:50.971
Hey, Don. Hey.

07:51.004 --> 07:52.540
Heard the call on the scanner.

07:52.573 --> 07:54.041
We got 20 different accounts
on what happened here.

07:54.074 --> 07:56.009
Hundreds of rounds,
partial video clips.

07:56.043 --> 07:58.011
We could really use someone
to help sort through the data.

07:58.045 --> 08:00.581
Okay. Um, excuse me.

08:00.614 --> 08:02.616
May I borrow this for a second?

08:02.650 --> 08:04.017
Thank you. So, um,

08:04.051 --> 08:06.520
let's say you wanted
to take a panoramic photograph

08:06.554 --> 08:09.757
of, uh, Downtown L.A.
with a digital camera.

08:09.790 --> 08:11.792
(shutter clicking)

08:11.825 --> 08:14.127
You'd take five pictures
in a row,

08:14.161 --> 08:16.930
and then the camera sorts
through the information

08:16.964 --> 08:19.600
and stitches together
a composite image.

08:19.633 --> 08:22.703
Your witness's memories are like
a sequence of snapshots.

08:22.736 --> 08:24.271
And like the digital camera,

08:24.304 --> 08:26.907
Spectral representations
synthesis sorts

08:26.940 --> 08:29.309
through the overlapping data
between statements

08:29.342 --> 08:30.611
and crime scene evidence,

08:30.644 --> 08:32.580
discarding
the redundant information

08:32.613 --> 08:35.048
until you're left
with the clearest scenarios

08:35.082 --> 08:37.317
or composites of what occurred.

08:37.350 --> 08:39.286
AMITA:
How's it going?

08:39.319 --> 08:40.754
CHARLIE: Yeah, great.
I should have

08:40.788 --> 08:42.590
the initial results by tonight.

08:42.623 --> 08:43.991
Is that Larry's work
from the tunnel?

08:44.024 --> 08:46.994
Yeah, it's stuff he did
when we were at Princeton,

08:47.027 --> 08:50.030
but it has nothing to do with
his upcoming work at Geneva.

08:50.063 --> 08:52.265
That's probably because
Larry's not going to Geneva.

08:52.299 --> 08:53.967
What?

08:54.001 --> 08:56.303
I called ahead
so we could surprise him

08:56.336 --> 08:58.572
over Christmas break,
and CERN said he pulled out.

08:58.606 --> 08:59.873
He pulled out?

09:01.108 --> 09:02.710
Speak of the devil.

09:02.743 --> 09:04.712
Hey, did you know that in
ancient times, people believed

09:04.745 --> 09:06.346
that the mere mention
of the devil's name

09:06.379 --> 09:07.347
would summon his appearance?

09:07.380 --> 09:09.349
At any rate,

09:09.382 --> 09:11.084
be on the lookout
for Jordan Farmar.

09:11.118 --> 09:12.352
Jordan Farmar's coming here?

09:12.385 --> 09:14.054
You remember when he
and Pau Gasol

09:14.087 --> 09:15.122
helped us win
the basketball game

09:15.155 --> 09:17.591
and I promised him a ride
on the space shuttle?

09:17.625 --> 09:18.659
You got NASA to agree?

09:18.692 --> 09:21.929
No, but I did get
the aeronautics lab to lend us

09:21.962 --> 09:23.864
- their simulator for an hour.
- Is there anything else

09:23.897 --> 09:25.933
you feel
like discussing with us,

09:25.966 --> 09:27.935
maybe involving CERN?

09:27.968 --> 09:29.036
Yeah.

09:29.069 --> 09:30.771
I won't be going.

09:30.804 --> 09:32.906
Oh, it just... it isn't me.

09:32.940 --> 09:34.241
CHARLIE:
Just isn't you?

09:34.274 --> 09:36.343
Most brilliant minds
in the world all in one place.

09:36.376 --> 09:38.679
Can't think of anything
that's more you.

09:38.712 --> 09:40.648
Well, as much as I appreciate
the compliment,

09:40.681 --> 09:43.350
it just doesn't seem like
a productive use of my time.

09:43.383 --> 09:45.853
You mean you don't believe
in the God particle?

09:45.886 --> 09:49.222
No, actually,
I am confident upwards of 88.2%

09:49.256 --> 09:50.658
that they will detect it,

09:50.691 --> 09:54.227
but, eh, they can do it
without me.

09:54.261 --> 09:56.730
DAVID:
Fox is the real deal.

09:56.764 --> 09:58.866
He even mentored Don
back in the day.

09:58.899 --> 10:00.901
This SOG squad he was running--

10:00.934 --> 10:02.770
used to have something
like it at LAPD.

10:02.803 --> 10:04.304
Yeah, we follow
violent criminals,

10:04.337 --> 10:07.274
wait for them to commit a crime,
then bop-bop, we take them down.

10:07.307 --> 10:08.642
Makes for an ironclad
prosecution.

10:08.676 --> 10:09.810
Or in this case,

10:09.843 --> 10:12.379
two dead agents, Hale and Ryba.

10:12.412 --> 10:13.747
And both married,
both with kids.

10:13.781 --> 10:15.248
DAVID: Doesn't get any worse
than that.

10:15.282 --> 10:16.283
Yeah, actually, it does.

10:16.316 --> 10:19.720
Ryba's wife is due next month.

10:21.789 --> 10:23.390
The wound Wilson had,

10:23.423 --> 10:25.258
he could not have gotten far.

10:25.292 --> 10:27.695
And no local hospitals
or urgent care centers

10:27.728 --> 10:30.798
have received any gunshot
victims since last night.

10:30.831 --> 10:33.133
Wilson's phone records are in--
no outgoing calls

10:33.166 --> 10:34.401
for the last two days.

10:34.434 --> 10:36.103
He had three incoming calls--

10:36.136 --> 10:37.404
two seconds each--

10:37.437 --> 10:39.707
from yesterday,
all the same number.

10:39.740 --> 10:43.310
(dialing phone)

10:43.343 --> 10:45.746
(line ringing)

10:45.779 --> 10:48.115
WOMAN: You've reached the
Santa Monica Veterinary Clinic.

10:48.148 --> 10:50.117
No one is available
to take your call...

10:50.150 --> 10:51.651
Vets know how to stitch wounds.

10:55.723 --> 10:57.357
(doorknob rattles)

10:57.390 --> 10:59.459
It says they're open 24 hours.

10:59.492 --> 11:01.962
Maybe they didn't mean
all in a row.

11:01.995 --> 11:03.997
DAVID: Hey, there's a light on
there in the back.

11:06.800 --> 11:09.236
(chuckles)
What do you got there, man?

11:09.269 --> 11:10.771
Tinseltown Talent and Extras.

11:10.804 --> 11:12.105
Thinking about hiring
one of these girls

11:12.139 --> 11:13.974
to come down and impersonate
a rocket scientist

11:14.007 --> 11:15.075
on Friday night.

11:15.108 --> 11:16.910
Have you ever seen them act?

11:16.944 --> 11:19.212
There's a reason why
they call them extras.

11:19.246 --> 11:20.781
(door unlocks)

11:20.814 --> 11:22.816
You're getting
way too good at that.

11:35.495 --> 11:36.764
FBI!

11:38.331 --> 11:40.467
(laughing): There's no way I'm
going back to jail, man.

11:40.500 --> 11:42.102
Take it easy.
Nobody needs to get hurt.

11:42.135 --> 11:43.737
I'm going to kill her!
(moans)

11:43.771 --> 11:45.472
I don't have a clean shot.
Do you?

11:45.505 --> 11:46.473
Yep.
(muffled gunshot)

11:51.879 --> 11:54.414
Cat tranquillizer gun.
Got it from over there.

11:54.447 --> 11:57.484
DON: We know you shot Ryba
at point-blank range.

11:57.517 --> 11:59.186
Bull.

11:59.219 --> 12:00.921
Your word against
a decorated FBI agent's.

12:00.954 --> 12:02.322
You can't do better than that?

12:02.355 --> 12:05.158
I know I'm going down for this
no matter what,

12:05.192 --> 12:08.161
but you have your facts
all wrong.

12:19.272 --> 12:21.508
I saw my chance
and got out of Dodge.

12:21.541 --> 12:22.876
Yeah.
You left your crew to die.

12:22.910 --> 12:25.412
They knew the risks.

12:25.445 --> 12:27.414
I'll take responsibility

12:27.447 --> 12:29.349
for what happened to my people.

12:29.382 --> 12:31.284
I suggest you do the same.

12:32.820 --> 12:33.486
We robbed the bank.

12:35.388 --> 12:36.556
I didn't kill your guys.

12:36.589 --> 12:38.525
You don't believe me,

12:38.558 --> 12:40.828
run a polygraph.

12:40.861 --> 12:43.063
DON: You know, Wilson's
pretty adamant he didn't do it.

12:43.096 --> 12:44.932
Well, you know, he may be right.

12:44.965 --> 12:46.967
I've got five likely scenarios.

12:47.000 --> 12:48.568
Now, based on the angle
of fire,

12:48.601 --> 12:50.570
it would have been
virtually impossible

12:50.603 --> 12:54.107
for Wilson to have shot
Agent Hale or Agent Ryba.

12:55.943 --> 12:59.112
So, either Agent Fox's memory
is really bad, or...

12:59.146 --> 13:02.115
He's lying
about what really happened.

13:07.587 --> 13:09.289
DAVID:
Fox was on HRT.

13:09.322 --> 13:11.058
He taught tactics
out of Quantico.

13:11.091 --> 13:13.293
Worked on the investigation
of the embassy bombing

13:13.326 --> 13:14.561
in Ethiopia.

13:14.594 --> 13:15.829
NIKKI:
Former Navy SEAL.

13:15.863 --> 13:16.729
Saw combat.

13:16.763 --> 13:18.365
Does this strike you
as the kind of guy

13:18.398 --> 13:19.599
that gets easily confused?

13:19.632 --> 13:21.835
I doubt if he ever saw three
of his people

13:21.869 --> 13:23.370
- gunned down before.
- Fox is near retirement.

13:23.403 --> 13:26.339
He gives up a great job
at headquarters

13:26.373 --> 13:27.875
to take a drop in pay

13:27.908 --> 13:30.210
to chase after
a bank robbery crew that's known

13:30.243 --> 13:32.479
for shooting at cops?
Yeah, way to take it easy.

13:32.512 --> 13:33.947
Well, it makes sense--
he's an adrenaline junkie.

13:33.981 --> 13:35.215
He wanted to go out on top.

13:35.248 --> 13:38.285
I mean, Jim Wilson would have
been one hell of a final trophy

13:38.318 --> 13:39.252
on his wall.

13:39.286 --> 13:41.088
Hey, so Gordon's awake.
I want a statement.

13:41.121 --> 13:42.355
Uh, I don't care if...

13:43.656 --> 13:45.825
...if she's pumped up
on painkillers.

13:46.994 --> 13:49.429
Wow, look at that.

13:49.462 --> 13:52.265
We'd just nabbed two guys
on the most wanted list

13:52.299 --> 13:54.001
in the same day.

13:54.034 --> 13:55.335
Never been done before.

13:55.368 --> 13:56.403
Or since.

13:59.006 --> 14:00.107
What's up, Nikki?

14:00.140 --> 14:02.309
Having trouble buying
Fox's whole hazy memory thing.

14:02.342 --> 14:04.311
- I'm sorry.
- Oh.

14:04.344 --> 14:07.180
He's going to be investigated
like everybody else.

14:10.050 --> 14:12.185
I have absolutely no idea
what's going on.

14:12.219 --> 14:13.987
I spoke to Stromsborg.

14:14.021 --> 14:15.956
Yeah, and he... yeah, he told me

14:15.989 --> 14:18.358
that Larry dropped
his course load for next year.

14:18.391 --> 14:20.493
No. No, I'm serious.

14:20.527 --> 14:22.562
Oh, I got to go. I got to go.

14:22.595 --> 14:24.497
I'll call you back later.
Bye-bye.

14:24.531 --> 14:29.169
So, this is
the most likely scenario.

14:29.202 --> 14:30.938
Yeah, I wish I could
have been there.

14:30.971 --> 14:32.372
Well, give me a full day
of sunlight

14:32.405 --> 14:33.473
and some 3-D laser scanning,

14:33.506 --> 14:35.342
I'll give you
the next best thing.

14:35.375 --> 14:36.409
Laser scanning-- I've seen that

14:36.443 --> 14:37.077
on Discovery Channel's
Extreme Engineering.

14:37.110 --> 14:39.479
It's back to the photograph.

14:39.512 --> 14:41.681
As beautiful and impressive
as it is,

14:41.714 --> 14:43.516
we're only seeing
two dimensions.

14:43.550 --> 14:46.353
See, laser scanning works on
the principle of triangulation.

14:46.386 --> 14:48.355
Now, using the known angles

14:48.388 --> 14:51.992
and the distance between the
camera and the laser emitter,

14:52.025 --> 14:54.161
we can create a 3-D replica
of the environment,

14:54.194 --> 14:55.495
which we can navigate through.

14:55.528 --> 14:57.197
So, using spectral
synthesis model,

14:57.230 --> 14:59.166
I can place witnesses,
the FBI agents,

14:59.199 --> 15:00.467
the robbers

15:00.500 --> 15:02.269
in their precise locations.

15:02.302 --> 15:04.604
Okay. I haven't seen that
on Discovery Channel.

15:35.068 --> 15:37.604
*

15:56.523 --> 15:57.490
Aah!

15:57.524 --> 15:59.359
FOX:
Flashlight!

15:59.392 --> 16:00.727
Come on, kid, your flashlight.
(alarm ringing)

16:00.760 --> 16:02.429
Draw fire away from you.

16:02.462 --> 16:03.730
- Yeah, yeah.
- Tac rule number two.

16:03.763 --> 16:05.732
Always the teacher.

16:05.765 --> 16:09.502
Think Hale and Ryba's widows
would disagree.

16:09.536 --> 16:11.171
Let's get out of here.

16:11.204 --> 16:13.606
Hey, you ever hear
anything about my brother?

16:13.640 --> 16:15.675
Charlie Eppes? The guy who
catches criminals without a gun?

16:15.708 --> 16:17.544
Yeah, I think the director
has mentioned his name

16:17.577 --> 16:19.746
- a few dozen times.
- You know, the thing is,

16:19.779 --> 16:21.448
Pete, he's been running
some scenarios,

16:21.481 --> 16:23.683
and, um, they're not quite
meshing with your story.

16:28.321 --> 16:31.491
Hale, Ryba and Gordon--
all good agents;

16:31.524 --> 16:34.427
not exactly who I wanted
in a gunfight.

16:34.461 --> 16:36.396
Why'd you have them on the team?

16:36.429 --> 16:37.664
You take who you can get.

16:37.697 --> 16:39.466
It's not like there
are any 25-year-old

16:39.499 --> 16:41.101
Donnie Eppeses out there.

16:41.134 --> 16:42.435
Ah, come on, you don't remember.

16:42.469 --> 16:43.570
I was pretty green, pal.

16:43.603 --> 16:44.671
(chuckling):
Oh, you think?

16:44.704 --> 16:45.772
Get out of here.

16:45.805 --> 16:48.408
Yeah, but they let me mold you.

16:48.441 --> 16:49.542
Now all our training days

16:49.576 --> 16:52.445
are taken up getting lectured to
by lawyers who care more

16:52.479 --> 16:55.215
about getting sued
than they do arresting bad guys.

16:55.248 --> 16:58.218
What, that's why you left DC?

16:58.251 --> 17:01.421
Yeah, tired of kissing ass.

17:01.454 --> 17:04.424
And I wanted to catch
a few more bad guys--

17:04.457 --> 17:06.559
before I catch
a few hundred bass.

17:06.593 --> 17:12.232
Still, a lot of stuff
went wrong out there, Pete.

17:12.265 --> 17:14.667
Yeah, there's no sense
smearing anybody's reputation.

17:14.701 --> 17:16.369
Hale and Ryba got families.

17:16.403 --> 17:18.538
You give DC a reason
to withhold pension,

17:18.571 --> 17:19.839
and they will.

17:19.872 --> 17:22.442
- Right?
- Mm-hmm.

17:25.378 --> 17:28.381
So, it's official--
Larry's leaving.

17:28.415 --> 17:30.150
He's resigned?

17:30.183 --> 17:31.584
Uh, well, not exactly.

17:31.618 --> 17:34.621
Word is that he won't return
the dean's phone calls.

17:34.654 --> 17:36.556
Larry forgets to return
your phone calls.

17:36.589 --> 17:38.291
- That's true.
- Okay, so let's not rent out

17:38.325 --> 17:39.426
his office just yet.
(knocking)

17:39.459 --> 17:41.128
- CHARLIE: Hey.
- Hey, Coach.

17:42.262 --> 17:44.097
- Jordan.
- How's it going?

17:44.131 --> 17:46.533
Or should I say
world champion Jordan Farmar.

17:46.566 --> 17:48.468
How's it going?
Congratulations, man.

17:48.501 --> 17:49.702
JORDAN:
How's the team doing?

17:49.736 --> 17:51.604
We've lost every game since.

17:51.638 --> 17:53.240
Uh, this
is Professor Ramanujan.

17:53.273 --> 17:54.307
- Hi.
- It's nice to meet you.

17:54.341 --> 17:55.375
If UCLA had teachers like you,

17:55.408 --> 17:57.377
I might actually gone to class.

17:57.410 --> 17:58.711
My fiancГ©e.

17:58.745 --> 17:59.846
Oh.

17:59.879 --> 18:01.348
CHARLIE:
No, you know, you're looking

18:01.381 --> 18:02.649
- for the simulator?
- Yeah.

18:02.682 --> 18:03.650
It's straight across campus
from here.

18:03.683 --> 18:05.618
It's the only
red brick building on campus,

18:05.652 --> 18:06.586
so you can't miss it.

18:06.619 --> 18:08.621
It's kind of a... a slam dunk.

18:08.655 --> 18:10.490
(Charlie chuckles)

18:11.691 --> 18:13.526
Was that Jordan Farmar?

18:13.560 --> 18:15.195
He calls me "coach."

18:15.228 --> 18:16.463
Here's the info you needed.

18:16.496 --> 18:17.597
He's single, isn't he?

18:17.630 --> 18:19.832
It didn't come up
in conversation.

18:19.866 --> 18:22.235
You know, Professor,
friends help friends.

18:22.269 --> 18:23.736
Look, I'm in a pinch, all right?

18:23.770 --> 18:25.238
I need a date for Friday night.

18:29.442 --> 18:31.711
I don't know how much
I could help.

18:31.744 --> 18:34.847
All these drugs-- it feels
like I drank a six-pack.

18:34.881 --> 18:38.451
Do you remember seeing
Jim Wilson shoot Agent Ryba?

18:39.686 --> 18:42.289
There was so much going on.

18:42.322 --> 18:43.856
It's not at all
like when you train.

18:54.934 --> 18:57.570
(groaning)

19:06.479 --> 19:06.813
(groans)

19:06.846 --> 19:16.889
(gunfire)

19:16.889 --> 19:26.899
(gunfire)

19:57.464 --> 19:57.497
(body hits ground)

19:58.130 --> 19:59.098
That's when I blacked out.

19:59.131 --> 19:59.399
John and I went
through the academy together.

19:59.432 --> 20:00.099
So...

20:00.132 --> 20:00.367
So you didn't see who shot Ryba?

20:00.400 --> 20:01.167
No.

20:02.402 --> 20:03.202
I can't believe
they're both gone.

20:03.236 --> 20:04.170
We had an expert
run some scenarios.

20:04.203 --> 20:04.837
Your first position,
are you sure about it?

20:04.871 --> 20:05.805
Your expert-- was he there?

20:05.838 --> 20:08.074
Because we could have
used an extra hand.

20:08.107 --> 20:08.140
I'm sure that John and Martin
would have appreciated it, too.

20:09.342 --> 20:10.142
All right, um, maybe we should,
uh, just come back later.

20:10.176 --> 20:10.410
Yeah, that's probably
a good idea.

20:10.443 --> 20:10.477
Yup.

20:11.077 --> 20:12.979
LARRY:
See, in reality,

20:13.012 --> 20:13.546
almost the entire
space shuttle reentry

20:13.580 --> 20:14.414
is done on autopilot.

20:14.447 --> 20:15.648
Flying manually
takes nerves of steel.

20:15.682 --> 20:16.215
More than going to the hole
with LeBron James guarding you?

20:16.249 --> 20:16.983
Okay, the ship is yours,

20:17.016 --> 20:18.551
- Captain Farmar.
- Bring it.

20:18.585 --> 20:19.419
(whirring)

20:19.452 --> 20:20.387
- I thought I'd find you here.
- Hey.

20:20.420 --> 20:21.020
Put your seat backs up
and drop your Tang.

20:21.053 --> 20:21.888
It's time to land, people.

20:21.921 --> 20:22.455
I transferred the data
you requested

20:22.489 --> 20:22.522
to the supercomputer.

20:24.190 --> 20:24.824
LARRY:
Keep your nose up.

20:24.857 --> 20:25.725
Heat shields will only work

20:25.758 --> 20:27.594
at a specified angle of...
40 degrees.

20:27.627 --> 20:29.296
I'm all over it.

20:29.329 --> 20:31.030
I've seen the new Star Trek
three times.

20:31.063 --> 20:33.566
You, uh... you dropped
your application

20:33.600 --> 20:34.901
- for the Wolff grant.
- True.

20:34.934 --> 20:36.035
Watch your thrusters.

20:36.068 --> 20:37.904
Why did you do that?

20:37.937 --> 20:39.706
Because I won't be
needing it anymore.

20:39.739 --> 20:41.774
And watch your angle of reentry.

20:43.476 --> 20:44.577
You're not coming back, are you?

20:44.611 --> 20:47.280
Charlie,
I may move with the irregularity

20:47.314 --> 20:49.015
of the Catalina 9 comet,

20:49.048 --> 20:51.984
but like the aforementioned
ball of ice,

20:52.018 --> 20:54.387
I, too, always return
to my point of origin.

20:54.421 --> 20:56.556
(alarms blaring)

20:56.589 --> 20:58.525
What happened?

20:58.558 --> 21:00.560
LeBron James just rejected you.

21:04.797 --> 21:06.065
NIKKI:
A half day?

21:06.098 --> 21:07.767
Ah, Charlie called
with some results.

21:07.800 --> 21:09.936
Yeah, don't forget
about our bet.

21:09.969 --> 21:12.004
Please. We have
so many ladies lined up,

21:12.038 --> 21:14.374
my partner here is running one
of Charlie's algorithms

21:14.407 --> 21:16.609
to narrow down our choices
as we speak.

21:16.643 --> 21:18.010
That's the truth, you know.

21:18.044 --> 21:20.480
I got them spinning
in the other room.

21:20.513 --> 21:23.015
Last year, the Office
of Professional Responsibility

21:23.049 --> 21:24.651
opened an investigation

21:24.684 --> 21:27.454
into Fox
for a sexual misconduct charge.

21:27.487 --> 21:29.622
Not "a"-- more like multiple.

21:29.656 --> 21:32.359
Look at this--
two female agents came forward,

21:32.392 --> 21:33.326
and then a third.

21:33.360 --> 21:34.827
"Handled internally.
No discipline required."

21:34.861 --> 21:35.762
What does that mean?

21:35.795 --> 21:37.830
That means I think we know
why he left DC.

21:37.864 --> 21:39.566
Yeah, he was forced out.

21:39.599 --> 21:41.668
Then, he went back to doing
what he knows best--

21:41.701 --> 21:42.969
- chasing bad guys.
- After all that time

21:43.002 --> 21:46.339
sitting at a desk,
Wyatt Earp got a little rusty.

21:49.075 --> 21:51.043
DAVID:
Charlie, this is incredible.

21:51.077 --> 21:53.513
My confidence interval is 90%.

21:53.546 --> 21:55.014
Shooting began here.

21:55.047 --> 21:56.549
AMITA:
By moving the axis,

21:56.583 --> 21:58.885
we're able to look
at an alternate perspective.

22:05.124 --> 22:06.393
Wait.

22:06.426 --> 22:08.861
Can you push in
on her final position?

22:12.131 --> 22:14.401
How fast can I get
a printout of this?

22:21.073 --> 22:23.042
COLBY:
You lied about your position.

22:23.075 --> 22:24.811
Pile of shell casings
right here proves it--

22:24.844 --> 22:26.846
that your gun
was the only one firing

22:26.879 --> 22:28.381
nine millimeter rounds.

22:30.116 --> 22:31.918
Any chance you want
to revise your story?

22:33.520 --> 22:34.954
Okay. You're right.

22:34.987 --> 22:36.989
I didn't tell you the truth.

22:37.023 --> 22:39.158
But it wasn't to protect me.

22:39.191 --> 22:41.994
It was to protect Hale.

22:42.028 --> 22:42.895
(screaming)

22:50.036 --> 22:51.070
Go! Take cover!

22:56.743 --> 22:58.411
(screaming)

23:09.889 --> 23:13.059
Agent Hale shot and killed Ryba?

23:15.227 --> 23:16.128
(gunshots)

23:21.133 --> 23:24.170
I only did it to protect John
and his family.

23:24.203 --> 23:27.907
We went through
the academy together.

23:27.940 --> 23:29.776
It's all so screwed up.

23:31.177 --> 23:32.211
FOX:
"Screwed up."

23:32.244 --> 23:34.180
Wouldn't be my choice of words.

23:34.213 --> 23:35.147
DON:
You're right.

23:35.181 --> 23:37.083
- It was a bad shooting.
- Dying in the line

23:37.116 --> 23:38.985
of duty doing the thing you love
is one thing,

23:39.018 --> 23:40.953
but to be shot
by one of your own...

23:40.987 --> 23:42.154
- Definitely complicates things.
- Oh, the hell it does.

23:42.188 --> 23:43.823
Wilson still goes down.

23:43.856 --> 23:45.525
Well, he's not
the only one, Pete.

23:45.558 --> 23:48.227
(sighs)

23:48.260 --> 23:49.696
I know.

23:51.698 --> 23:53.666
My agents, my responsibility--
no matter what.

23:56.235 --> 23:57.436
Run your investigation.

23:57.470 --> 24:00.673
There are plenty of private
security companies out there.

24:00.707 --> 24:03.976
Pay a hell of a lot more
than the FBI.

24:07.013 --> 24:10.116
I only did it to protect John
and his family.

24:12.184 --> 24:15.187
I got the laser scanner
in the car.

24:17.156 --> 24:19.058
Wow.

24:19.091 --> 24:20.192
Incredible.

24:20.226 --> 24:22.128
LARRY:
Two solid rocket boosters,

24:22.161 --> 24:24.263
each providing 12.5 million

24:24.296 --> 24:27.066
newtons of thrust at liftoff.

24:27.099 --> 24:29.636
"For every action, there is
an equal and opposite reaction."

24:29.669 --> 24:31.237
Sir Isaac Newton.

24:31.270 --> 24:34.641
Arguably the greatest scientist
who ever lived.

24:34.674 --> 24:37.009
But, you know, he spent more of
his time writing interpretations

24:37.043 --> 24:39.546
of the Bible than he ever did
on the laws of physics?

24:39.579 --> 24:40.747
(sighs)

24:40.780 --> 24:42.882
Is that why you're not going
to Switzerland?

24:42.915 --> 24:44.817
Thinking of heading back
to the monastery?

24:44.851 --> 24:47.286
No. I think
they found me disruptive.

24:47.319 --> 24:49.021
(chuckles)

24:49.055 --> 24:50.957
I need a new path.

24:50.990 --> 24:53.292
You can always go back
into space.

24:53.325 --> 24:56.228
You know, I spent most
of my time looking out windows

24:56.262 --> 25:00.633
like this, made of aluminum
and fused silicate.

25:00.667 --> 25:04.871
Well, the Milky Way
tastes like raspberries.

25:04.904 --> 25:06.673
But it was lost on me.

25:06.706 --> 25:10.977
I imagined I'd be basking in
the brilliance of these stars,

25:11.010 --> 25:13.580
but, oh, I was robbed.

25:13.613 --> 25:18.017
Free of atmosphere,
with no interference--

25:18.050 --> 25:22.655
how brightly
those stars must shine

25:22.689 --> 25:24.223
and how beautifully.

25:24.256 --> 25:26.125
You're talking about clarity.

25:33.199 --> 25:34.601
Fox is definitely old-school.

25:34.634 --> 25:36.302
Old-school good
or old-school bad?

25:36.335 --> 25:37.904
Old-school, like he gets away
with stuff

25:37.937 --> 25:39.138
that Don would kick
our asses for.

25:39.171 --> 25:42.942
He's got multiple CIs, plenty
of payments and few arrests.

25:42.975 --> 25:45.177
He must have naked pictures
of someone with someone

25:45.211 --> 25:46.746
to get away with breaking
protocol like this.

25:46.779 --> 25:47.980
And what's bugging you?

25:48.014 --> 25:49.115
It's Ryba.

25:49.148 --> 25:50.650
I mean, no disrespect
to the dead,

25:50.683 --> 25:53.319
but this guy had no business
being on Fox's team.

25:53.352 --> 25:54.887
- Why not?
- Look at his file.

25:54.921 --> 25:56.589
I mean, he's been working
white-collar desk jobs

25:56.623 --> 25:58.324
since the day he got out
of the academy.

25:58.357 --> 26:01.127
So, why does HQ put him
on an SOG team following one

26:01.160 --> 26:02.895
of the most violent
robbery crews in America?

26:02.929 --> 26:05.297
Yeah, Fox does not strike me
as the kind of guy

26:05.331 --> 26:07.566
that wants to be
breaking in newbies.

26:17.644 --> 26:19.211
Uh...

26:20.346 --> 26:22.615
What is it about this garage?

26:22.649 --> 26:24.283
I couldn't saw a piece
of wood straight in here,

26:24.316 --> 26:27.086
yet you and your brother solve
the problems of the world.

26:27.119 --> 26:29.789
You know, I first met Pete,
I swear it was like future me.

26:29.822 --> 26:32.091
Ass kicker who took care

26:32.124 --> 26:34.160
of his team, he didn't
sweat the bureaucrats.

26:34.193 --> 26:35.361
That sounds like current you.

26:35.394 --> 26:37.163
I have two dead agents.

26:38.297 --> 26:39.799
As much as I want to blame

26:39.832 --> 26:41.934
someone else,
Pete's call to go in.

26:41.968 --> 26:43.970
First Bloom, now Pete.

26:44.003 --> 26:46.739
So, what do you think,
you're-you're next?

26:48.440 --> 26:49.942
You know how...

26:49.976 --> 26:53.179
I think I survived
all these years, really?

26:53.212 --> 26:55.314
What is comes down to is...
is instincts.

26:55.347 --> 26:58.184
These guys
are just as good as me.

26:58.217 --> 26:59.251
They're better.

27:01.988 --> 27:03.990
Sooner or later,

27:04.023 --> 27:06.258
(grunting):
everything slows down, I guess.

27:06.292 --> 27:08.961
Oh, you're thinking
of the stabbing.

27:08.995 --> 27:10.429
What do you think,
you lost a step?

27:10.462 --> 27:12.732
Yeah, I definitely lost a step.

27:12.765 --> 27:14.433
I can't remember the last time

27:14.466 --> 27:16.869
I beat Colby or David
in a foot chase.

27:18.705 --> 27:20.707
You know,
I once designed this park

27:20.740 --> 27:22.141
at the top of Temescal Canyon,

27:22.174 --> 27:24.911
and in the center was this
absolutely perfect pond.

27:24.944 --> 27:27.046
I designed everything around it.

27:27.079 --> 27:30.449
And, um, I used to go up there
just to see the pond.

27:30.482 --> 27:33.686
Years later, the, um,
landscape grew in,

27:33.720 --> 27:35.187
started to cover the view.

27:36.322 --> 27:37.389
I was annoyed...

27:37.423 --> 27:38.958
at first.

27:38.991 --> 27:40.893
I wanted to cut everything back,

27:40.927 --> 27:43.462
but then I started
to notice the trees.

27:43.495 --> 27:45.264
The California rosebuds

27:45.297 --> 27:47.433
and the, um...
the western sycamores

27:47.466 --> 27:49.068
and... and those lilacs.

27:49.101 --> 27:50.402
I'm telling you, those li...

27:50.436 --> 27:52.138
I can still smell
those lilacs right now.

27:52.171 --> 27:54.373
And what happened to the pond?

27:54.406 --> 27:55.775
It's still there.

27:55.808 --> 27:57.877
But I tell you something.

27:57.910 --> 28:00.780
It's not the most important
thing to me anymore.

28:04.984 --> 28:06.318
David.

28:06.352 --> 28:08.220
I know that look.
We're hooked up with the judge

28:08.254 --> 28:08.620
and her sister
for Friday night.

28:08.654 --> 28:09.621
Wrong look.

28:09.655 --> 28:11.490
Uh, what about the sushi chef
and her niece?

28:11.523 --> 28:12.725
That's just wishful thinking.

28:12.759 --> 28:14.493
Listen, remember you said

28:14.526 --> 28:16.462
that Agent Ryba had no business
being on Fox's squad?

28:16.495 --> 28:18.364
You were right.

28:18.397 --> 28:19.732
He was OPR.

28:19.766 --> 28:21.734
Internal affairs?

28:21.768 --> 28:24.503
Working undercover
to build a case against Fox,

28:24.536 --> 28:26.405
who apparently has a habit
of depositing the FBI's money

28:26.438 --> 28:28.174
into his own bank accounts.

28:28.207 --> 28:30.509
According to this, he was just
about to file that report

28:30.542 --> 28:32.511
when he was killed.

28:32.544 --> 28:34.146
Which means maybe somebody
besides Jim Wilson

28:34.180 --> 28:35.147
wanted him dead.

28:36.282 --> 28:37.817
Like Pete Fox.

28:44.056 --> 28:45.357
So, tell me,

28:45.391 --> 28:46.793
how does it feel

28:46.826 --> 28:48.761
having God inside you?

28:48.795 --> 28:51.463
Well, I mean,
tell you the truth,

28:51.497 --> 28:53.099
I'm still getting used
to the idea

28:53.132 --> 28:54.767
that there might
actually be one.

28:54.801 --> 28:58.137
I'll tell you, I have reached
a point of critical mass.

28:58.170 --> 28:59.972
Oh, yeah?

29:00.006 --> 29:01.540
You know, you've always
been able to maintain

29:01.573 --> 29:03.409
a rather simple view
of the world, haven't you?

29:03.442 --> 29:04.510
(laughing)

29:04.543 --> 29:07.013
Well, yeah, I mean,
law and order, black and white.

29:07.046 --> 29:09.215
Th-his is a compliment,
believe me.

29:09.248 --> 29:10.482
Okay.

29:10.516 --> 29:11.417
You know, your neurons,

29:11.450 --> 29:13.886
your synaptic connections,
your axons...

29:13.920 --> 29:15.888
I mean, they're rather
highly functioning.

29:17.356 --> 29:21.027
You know, I'm supposed
to work in Geneva.

29:21.060 --> 29:22.428
If I am in Switzerland,

29:22.461 --> 29:24.363
I want to be
seeing mountaintops.

29:24.396 --> 29:27.199
I don't want to be 100 meters
below the ground,

29:27.233 --> 29:29.836
like some fact-gathering mole,

29:29.869 --> 29:32.138
surrounded
by the Hadron collider,

29:32.171 --> 29:35.374
striving to collect 1,800 MBs
of data per second.

29:37.143 --> 29:39.545
I mean, not that I have any idea
what you're talking about,

29:39.578 --> 29:42.181
but, I mean, I think I
understand what you're saying

29:42.214 --> 29:43.382
with your collider thing.

29:43.415 --> 29:45.151
Right? It's-it's like,
we got this new

29:45.184 --> 29:46.585
Trilogy system
for running warrants.

29:46.618 --> 29:47.653
(laughing):
I'm sorry.

29:47.686 --> 29:49.455
Now I have no idea
what you're saying.

29:49.488 --> 29:52.091
We depend too much
on technology.

29:52.124 --> 29:54.326
Maybe we start
to lose our instincts.

29:54.360 --> 29:56.996
I mean, we're just cavemen,
ultimately.

29:57.029 --> 30:01.100
What if you just reverted
a little bit?

30:01.133 --> 30:03.970
Shed the theoretical, huh?

30:04.003 --> 30:06.505
Dwell on the here and now.

30:06.538 --> 30:09.241
(phone rings)
Excuse me.

30:09.275 --> 30:11.610
Hey, buddy, what's up?

30:11.643 --> 30:13.846
Uh, I got stuck in the office
rerunning some data.

30:13.880 --> 30:15.447
Listen, could you
open your laptop?

30:15.481 --> 30:16.315
Uh, it's already open.

30:16.348 --> 30:18.117
- All right. Check your e-mail.
- Okay.

30:18.150 --> 30:20.019
And what am I looking at?

30:20.052 --> 30:23.455
I don't think Agent Ryba
was killed by friendly fire.

30:23.489 --> 30:25.224
Ah, excellent. That's great.

30:25.257 --> 30:26.592
Actually, it's not.

30:31.964 --> 30:33.565
Gordon shot Ryba?

30:33.599 --> 30:35.234
And it wasn't an accident.

30:35.267 --> 30:37.203
It was an assassination.

30:46.012 --> 30:47.346
I already gave my statement.

30:47.379 --> 30:49.315
I lied to protect Hale.

30:49.348 --> 30:51.150
Now, please leave me alone.

30:51.183 --> 30:52.184
DAVID:
You found out

30:52.218 --> 30:54.053
that Ryba was OPR.

30:54.086 --> 30:56.022
- What are you talking about?
- NIKKI: Those days Ryba

30:56.055 --> 30:57.489
was supposed to be off training,

30:57.523 --> 30:59.425
he was actually
tailing you and Fox.

30:59.458 --> 31:00.592
And there's you and Pete

31:00.626 --> 31:02.261
checking into the Hyatt
two days ago.

31:02.294 --> 31:04.263
Both consenting adults.

31:04.296 --> 31:06.432
Last time I checked,
not a crime.

31:06.465 --> 31:08.134
When it's in dereliction
of duty,

31:08.167 --> 31:11.103
on company time,
and using FBI funds,

31:11.137 --> 31:12.371
yeah, actually, it is.

31:12.404 --> 31:13.906
Ryba's testimony
would have ended

31:13.940 --> 31:15.107
both your careers.

31:15.141 --> 31:16.042
Hundreds of bullets were flying.

31:16.075 --> 31:18.244
I mean, you saw a chance
to take Ryba out.

31:18.277 --> 31:20.079
Oh, you're crazy.

31:20.112 --> 31:21.280
We're not.

31:21.313 --> 31:25.484
We pulled this out of Ryba.

31:25.517 --> 31:28.120
It's a 28mm round.
FBI doesn't carry that.

31:28.154 --> 31:29.621
It came from one
of Wilson's crew.

31:29.655 --> 31:30.456
You're right.

31:30.489 --> 31:31.257
So we ran their weapons
for prints,

31:31.290 --> 31:33.092
and even though
they wore gloves,

31:33.125 --> 31:34.326
we still managed to pull one.

31:34.360 --> 31:35.361
Yours.

31:37.496 --> 31:39.966
Because I picked it up.

31:39.999 --> 31:41.300
- My gun jammed.
- According to your statement,

31:41.333 --> 31:43.569
you fired your final burst
from your MP5,

31:43.602 --> 31:45.337
and then you lost consciousness.

31:45.371 --> 31:47.406
No, but I meant the FN P90.

31:47.439 --> 31:49.141
I picked it up.

31:49.175 --> 31:50.709
- My gun went dry...
- NIKKI: Try again.

31:50.742 --> 31:52.644
The FN was a few feet away
from you,

31:52.678 --> 31:54.146
right where you tossed it.

32:01.653 --> 32:03.255
Ryba was a rat.

32:06.492 --> 32:08.727
The man risked his life
to save you,

32:08.760 --> 32:10.696
and you repaid him
with a bullet.

32:10.729 --> 32:13.099
The guy sold out
his own classmate.

32:13.132 --> 32:14.433
He was weak.

32:14.466 --> 32:16.335
We had to carry him
through Quantico.

32:16.368 --> 32:17.469
How do you think
he ended up at OPR?

32:17.503 --> 32:18.304
No one else would have him.

32:18.337 --> 32:20.339
He told me and Pete
to cut it out.

32:20.372 --> 32:21.340
Can you imagine?

32:21.373 --> 32:22.741
Threatening us?

32:22.774 --> 32:25.044
What the hell did he think
he was doing?

32:25.077 --> 32:26.245
His job.

32:29.681 --> 32:32.718
Returning your books
well thumbed, but unharmed.

32:32.751 --> 32:34.253
Thanks.

32:34.286 --> 32:36.422
What... I thought your work
for Don was done.

32:36.455 --> 32:39.091
Well, what do they say
about the pleasures of math?

32:39.125 --> 32:40.359
"Lie not in discovering truth,

32:40.392 --> 32:42.361
but in seeking it." Tolstoy.

32:42.394 --> 32:44.363
Here I always thought
it was Fleinhardt.

32:44.396 --> 32:46.965
You said that to me
the first day we met.

32:48.100 --> 32:49.401
- You mad at me, Charlie?
- No.

32:49.435 --> 32:52.004
(chuckles softly)

32:52.038 --> 32:54.306
You-you passed up
a once-in-a-lifetime

32:54.340 --> 32:56.442
opportunity to work
with the greatest minds

32:56.475 --> 32:59.345
in the world.

32:59.378 --> 33:00.612
You quit teaching

33:00.646 --> 33:03.715
to run away.

33:03.749 --> 33:06.452
That-that-that is what
you're doing, right?

33:06.485 --> 33:08.454
You're running, right?

33:08.487 --> 33:11.023
You know, my favorite part
about running

33:11.057 --> 33:14.026
is you don't have
to plan your route,

33:14.060 --> 33:15.761
but you do have
to keep on moving.

33:15.794 --> 33:18.064
Why you moving away from us?

33:19.198 --> 33:21.167
Why are you moving away

33:21.200 --> 33:23.302
from the people that love you?

33:23.335 --> 33:25.804
Galileo did
his most important work

33:25.837 --> 33:27.606
at his villa atArcetri.

33:27.639 --> 33:29.608
Yeah, he was under
house arrest at the time.

33:29.641 --> 33:31.510
"Success is not how far

33:31.543 --> 33:33.612
"you get,
but the distance you travel

33:33.645 --> 33:35.181
from where you started."

33:35.214 --> 33:37.049
Now you're quoting
sneaker commercials?

33:37.083 --> 33:39.251
If the shoe fits.

33:42.821 --> 33:45.524
Just do... j-just do me a favor.

33:45.557 --> 33:48.794
wh-whenever you reach
the finish line, wherever it is,

33:48.827 --> 33:52.364
just remember to write to me,

33:52.398 --> 33:55.434
'cause I need to know where
to send a wedding invitation.

33:55.467 --> 33:56.802
(clicks tongue)

34:08.680 --> 34:11.183
FBI agents
murdering FBI agents.

34:11.217 --> 34:12.418
What's next?

34:12.451 --> 34:14.220
You got me.

34:16.355 --> 34:18.557
CHARLIE:
You okay?

34:19.825 --> 34:23.162
I'm so sorry.

34:23.195 --> 34:24.363
I can't even imagine

34:24.396 --> 34:26.265
how you feel.

34:26.298 --> 34:28.200
I'd say it's like
hitting bottom.

34:28.234 --> 34:32.204
Well, uh, you might still
have a ways to go.

34:32.238 --> 34:36.542
My program revealed
one final piece of information.

34:43.815 --> 34:46.585
FOX:
Find what you were looking for?

35:03.535 --> 35:05.671
You used your backup gun!

35:05.704 --> 35:07.139
It's not registered!

35:15.947 --> 35:18.384
What are you going to do now,
Miranda me?

35:29.361 --> 35:31.630
Gave my life to this job.

35:31.663 --> 35:34.400
Finally found a woman I love,
chance to be happy.

35:34.433 --> 35:36.502
Now they're going to take that
away from me, too?

35:37.703 --> 35:41.173
(gunshots)

35:41.207 --> 35:42.874
Tactical rule
number three, Pete.

35:42.908 --> 35:45.477
You got to reload
when you can, right?

35:46.745 --> 35:48.180
How'd you know Ryba was OPR?

35:48.214 --> 35:50.582
Got a tip from a friend.

35:50.616 --> 35:52.551
I still have a few left.

35:54.286 --> 35:55.654
The case Ryba was building
against me,

35:55.687 --> 35:57.456
I was looking
at serious jail time.

35:57.489 --> 35:59.325
(chuckles)
Me.

36:01.460 --> 36:02.928
Hooked more fugitives
than anybody

36:02.961 --> 36:04.630
in the history of the Bureau.

36:04.663 --> 36:06.565
And Hale?

36:06.598 --> 36:07.633
What happened to him?

36:24.750 --> 36:26.252
(gunshots)

36:26.285 --> 36:27.686
(yells)

36:27.719 --> 36:29.955
(gasps)

36:32.924 --> 36:34.660
(groaning)

36:37.429 --> 36:38.597
(gunshot, yells)

36:57.583 --> 37:00.852
You know I can't let you
take me in, Don.

37:02.421 --> 37:03.522
Come on, Coach.

37:03.555 --> 37:04.890
You ain't as quick
as you used to be.

37:09.060 --> 37:11.297
This close.

37:12.798 --> 37:15.267
You still want to go
for center mass.

37:22.641 --> 37:24.610
(panting)

37:24.643 --> 37:26.712
Oh, God.

37:28.747 --> 37:30.649
Ah, Petey!

37:34.386 --> 37:36.855
(sirens wailing)

37:40.692 --> 37:42.861
(piano playing light jazz)

37:48.867 --> 37:49.668
Hey, how you doing?

37:49.701 --> 37:51.903
- I'm Jordan.
- Nice to meet you.

37:51.937 --> 37:53.372
Yeah. How you doing?

37:53.405 --> 37:54.540
Betancourt, right?

37:54.573 --> 37:56.074
My friends call me Nikki.

37:56.107 --> 37:57.776
I knew I knew you.

37:57.809 --> 37:59.411
You're a cop-- LAPD.

37:59.445 --> 38:01.413
Actually, I'm FBI now.

38:01.447 --> 38:03.014
Yeah.

38:03.048 --> 38:04.983
You arrested my friend
while we were in college.

38:05.016 --> 38:06.885
UCLA, corner of Wilshire
and Gayley.

38:06.918 --> 38:10.088
Homecoming weekend.

38:10.121 --> 38:12.891
Yeah, yeah, your pal
was drunk and disorderly.

38:12.924 --> 38:14.893
I gave him two chances
to move along,

38:14.926 --> 38:16.728
then he went out of his way
to throw up on my shoes.

38:16.762 --> 38:17.663
He had food poisoning.

38:17.696 --> 38:19.898
We were trying to get him
to the hospital.

38:19.931 --> 38:21.967
- Oh, okay.
- Plus,

38:22.000 --> 38:24.102
you threatened to mace me.

38:24.135 --> 38:25.871
I had anger issues back then,

38:25.904 --> 38:27.005
but I am much better now,

38:27.038 --> 38:29.675
Really. Come... come on.

38:29.708 --> 38:31.543
Was that Jordan Farmar
who just walked out on you?

38:31.577 --> 38:32.811
DAVID:
Man, he looks pissed.

38:32.844 --> 38:34.079
Yeah.

38:35.914 --> 38:37.015
Looks like we're Dutch tonight.

38:37.048 --> 38:38.149
COLBY:
I'm going to have to disagree.

38:38.183 --> 38:41.487
I'd like you to meet my date,
Agent David Sinclair.

38:41.520 --> 38:42.988
Very good rГ©sumГ©,

38:43.021 --> 38:43.955
very professional.

38:43.989 --> 38:45.657
He was just promoted
to supervisor, in fact.

38:45.691 --> 38:47.893
Cabernet, please,
and he'll have a Chardonnay.

38:47.926 --> 38:49.495
COLBY:
You are such a gentleman.

38:49.528 --> 38:51.062
Thank you so much.

38:52.398 --> 38:53.765
I can't believe this.

38:53.799 --> 38:55.367
COLBY:
Iam very hungry.

38:55.401 --> 38:56.902
- You?
- Absolutely starving.

38:56.935 --> 38:58.937
The surf and turf
looks delicious.

38:58.970 --> 39:00.906
Shellfish will upset
your stomach, though, remember.

39:00.939 --> 39:02.541
DAVID:
That's a good point.

39:02.574 --> 39:04.042
We'll have the filet.

39:04.075 --> 39:06.111
I'll have a, um, vodka
and soda with a twist.

39:06.144 --> 39:07.579
Actually, you know what?

39:07.613 --> 39:09.615
Hold the soda.
You know, hold the twist.

39:09.648 --> 39:10.916
Just bring the bottle.

39:10.949 --> 39:12.818
(glasses clinking)

39:12.851 --> 39:13.952
ALAN:
So, I was down here

39:13.985 --> 39:16.388
mapping my route
when I saw all this.

39:19.090 --> 39:19.925
It's Larry's work.

39:19.958 --> 39:22.394
AMITA:
Theoretical physics, cosmology.

39:22.428 --> 39:24.095
String theory, supersymmetry.

39:24.129 --> 39:25.931
It's all here.

39:25.964 --> 39:28.600
Yeah, but what is this?

39:28.634 --> 39:29.668
AMITA:
It's Hindi.

39:29.701 --> 39:31.069
It means, "All to son."

39:31.102 --> 39:34.973
He's leaving this--
all his work-- to you.

39:36.808 --> 39:39.077
* And I never really meant

39:39.110 --> 39:42.548
* To leave your side
(hammer pounding)

39:43.815 --> 39:48.454
* Looking down the road
of another life *

39:48.487 --> 39:53.892
* And I don't know what is left
inside our eyes *

39:58.163 --> 40:02.534
* No, don't walk away

40:04.135 --> 40:08.774
* Tell me all the steps
I need to take *

40:09.908 --> 40:12.978
* No

40:13.011 --> 40:16.615
* No one ever really knows

40:16.648 --> 40:20.486
* No one ever learns
to live alone *

40:20.519 --> 40:22.087
* They just get tired

40:22.120 --> 40:25.457
* And their hearts get cold

40:27.493 --> 40:32.798
* Never really knew
just what I'd find *

40:32.831 --> 40:37.035
* Looking down the road
of another life. *
