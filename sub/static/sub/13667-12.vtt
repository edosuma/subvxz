Came in two weeks ago
for treatment
of his Colon cancer,

07:18.832 --> 07:21.601
which, after two years,
made its way to his liver.

07:21.668 --> 07:25.572
His cheeks and eyes were Sunken.
His weight was down to--

07:25.639 --> 07:28.909

Ninety-Eight pounds.

07:28.975 --> 07:32.679
And after the usual
three-Ring circus
of C.A. Treatments,

07:32.746 --> 07:34.815
Mr. Grisanti
lapsed into a coma.

07:34.881 --> 07:37.484
Today he died.

07:37.551 --> 07:43.056
Any thoughts, any questions,
any eulogies or postmortems?

07:43.123 --> 07:46.059

an autopsy?
What Good would that do?

07:46.126 --> 07:48.562
Well, I'd want to rule out
brain metastases.

07:48.628 --> 07:50.330
What do you think
about that, white?

07:50.397 --> 07:53.800
An autopsy isn't necessary.
The cancer was widely
disseminated.

07:53.867 --> 07:58.338
Morrison, would you tell us
Why doctors get autopsies?

07:58.405 --> 08:02.709
So we're sure the clinical
evidence of death corresponds
with the pathological.

08:02.776 --> 08:07.547
<i>What's physically apparent
is not always the actual cause.</i>

08:07.614 --> 08:10.484
And why must we get a release
from the family?

08:10.550 --> 08:15.021
To free ourselves
and the hospital from any
legal responsibility.

08:15.088 --> 08:18.992
And if you can't get
the release, you're a wimp.

08:19.059 --> 08:22.429
I think we ought to do
an autopsy on the late
Mr. Grisanti.

08:22.496 --> 08:26.933
And since this was
your idea, Dr. Wade,
would you like to give it a try?

08:27.000 --> 08:29.302
No, thank you.

08:29.369 --> 08:33.874

had gone through,

08:36.409 --> 08:39.179

to agree?

the family for the release.

you'll see that
he's the same person.

15:36.963 --> 15:39.599
Only he's had to make
this complex decision.

15:39.666 --> 15:42.269
It was so obviously humiliating
for him to see me that I just--

15:42.335 --> 15:45.205

Is he married?

we saw Ellen and Anne.

that we bought together...

down, we never could get
the damn thing back up again!

the umbrella over my head.

to tell me now that

I have enough courage
to do something about it.
