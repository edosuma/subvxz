>> John: WELCOME, WELCOME,

00:37.233 --> 00:38.667
WELCOME TO "LAST WEEK TONIGHT."

00:38.734 --> 00:39.033
I'M JOHN OLIVER.

00:39.100 --> 00:39.767
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING

00:39.834 --> 00:40.400
US.

00:40.467 --> 00:42.000
JUST TIME FOR A QUICK RECAP OF

00:42.066 --> 00:42.700
THE WEEK, AND IT'S BEEN A

00:42.767 --> 00:44.233
DRAMATIC ONE FOR

00:44.300 --> 00:47.000
PRESIDENT TRUMP, A FLESH VESSEL

00:47.066 --> 00:48.633
POSSESSED BY THE WORLD'S

00:48.700 --> 00:49.300
30 DUMBEST GHOSTS.

00:49.367 --> 00:50.100
ON WEDNESDAY, AN UNNAMED SENIOR

00:50.166 --> 00:52.800
WHITE HOUSE OFFICIAL WROTE AN

00:52.867 --> 00:54.667
OP-ED IN THE "TIMES," CLAIMING

00:54.734 --> 00:55.300
TRUMP'S ACTIONS ARE "DETRIMENTAL

00:55.367 --> 00:59.033
TO THE HEALTH OF OUR REPUBLIC."

00:59.100 --> 01:01.333
TRUMP IMMEDIATELY PUSHED BACK,

01:01.400 --> 01:08.667
TWEETING "TREASON" IN ALL CAPS,

01:08.734 --> 01:09.266
AND ATTACKED THE ANONYMOUS

01:09.333 --> 01:10.667
WRITER

01:10.734 --> 01:11.967
WRITER AT A RALLY.

01:12.033 --> 01:12.600
>> THE LATEST ACT OF RESISTANCE

01:12.667 --> 01:13.200
IS THE OP-ED PUBLISHED IN THE

01:13.266 --> 01:14.533
FAILING "NEW YORK TIMES" BY AN

01:14.600 --> 01:16.433
"ANOMINOUSSSS" -- REALLY AN

01:16.500 --> 01:18.667
"ANOMINOUS" GUTLESS COWARD.

01:18.734 --> 01:19.767
>> John: YOU KNOW, I DON'T LIKE

01:19.834 --> 01:20.834
TRUMP'S POLICIES, IDEAS, OR

01:20.900 --> 01:22.300
DEMEANOR, BUT I DO LIKE HOW HE

01:22.367 --> 01:23.567
OCCASIONALLY SOUNDS LIKE A

01:23.633 --> 01:24.800
TEDDY RUXPIN SOMEONE FISHED OUT

01:24.867 --> 01:29.333
OF A LAKE.

01:29.400 --> 01:30.567
TRUMP IS NOW REPORTEDLY OBSESSED

01:30.633 --> 01:32.200
WITH FINDING OUT THE "ANONYMISH"

01:32.266 --> 01:33.133
SOURCE, ALTHOUGH HIS PROBLEM IS,

01:33.200 --> 01:34.200
IT SEEMS LIKE IT COULD BE ALMOST

01:34.266 --> 01:35.166
ANYONE WHO WORKS FOR HIM.

01:35.233 --> 01:36.934
BECAUSE THIS WEEK ALSO SAW

01:37.000 --> 01:38.200
EXPLOSIVE EXCERPTS FROM

01:38.266 --> 01:39.000
BOB WOODWARD'S UPCOMING BOOK, IN

01:39.066 --> 01:40.133
WHICH GENERAL MATTIS IS QUOTED

01:40.200 --> 01:42.100
AS SAYING TRUMP HAS THE

01:42.166 --> 01:42.900
UNDERSTANDING OF "A FIFTH- OR

01:42.967 --> 01:44.333
SIXTH-GRADER," AND JOHN KELLY

01:44.400 --> 01:45.400
REPORTEDLY SAYS, "WE'RE IN

01:45.467 --> 01:47.066
CRAZYTOWN.

01:47.133 --> 01:48.600
I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHY ANY OF US

01:48.667 --> 01:49.333
ARE HERE.

01:49.400 --> 01:51.200
THIS IS THE WORST JOB I'VE EVER

01:51.266 --> 01:52.700
HAD."

01:52.767 --> 01:57.367
NOW, BOTH MEN DENY MAKING THOSE

01:57.433 --> 01:58.800
STATEMENTS, AND I'M ABSOLUTELY

01:58.867 --> 01:59.333
SURE KELLY LOVES HIS JOB.

01:59.400 --> 02:00.400
HE SEEMS SO HAPPY WHENEVER YOU

02:00.467 --> 02:00.633
SEE HIM.

02:00.700 --> 02:01.700
ALTHOUGH, TO ME, THE BOOK'S MOST

02:01.767 --> 02:02.900
INCREDIBLE CLAIM IS THAT

02:02.967 --> 02:03.800
JOHN DOWD, THE PRESIDENT'S

02:03.867 --> 02:06.834
THEN-LAWYER, WENT DIRECTLY TO

02:06.900 --> 02:10.433
ROBERT MUELLER AND TOLD HIM

02:10.500 --> 02:11.233
TRUMP WAS SUCH A DISASTER DURING

02:11.300 --> 02:12.000
A PRACTICE INTERROGATION THAT HE

02:12.066 --> 02:12.734
COULDN'T POSSIBLY ALLOW HIM TO

02:12.800 --> 02:13.567
TESTIFY.

02:13.633 --> 02:14.567
>> WOODWARD QUOTES DOWD AS

02:14.633 --> 02:15.467
SAYING, DURING A MARCH 5TH

02:15.533 --> 02:16.266
MEETING WITH MUELLER, "I'M NOT

02:16.333 --> 02:17.800
GOING TO SIT THERE AND LET HIM

02:17.867 --> 02:19.734
LOOK LIKE AN IDIOT.

02:19.800 --> 02:20.600
AND YOU PUBLISH THAT TRANSCRIPT

02:20.667 --> 02:22.367
BECAUSE EVERYTHING LEAKS IN

02:22.433 --> 02:23.100
WASHINGTON AND THE GUYS OVERSEAS

02:23.166 --> 02:24.367
ARE GOING TO SAY, I TOLD YOU HE

02:24.433 --> 02:25.834
WAS AN IDIOT.

02:25.900 --> 02:26.533
I TOLD YOU HE WAS A GODDAMN

02:26.600 --> 02:30.200
DUMBBELL."

02:30.266 --> 02:31.333
>> John: THAT IS INCREDIBLE.

02:31.400 --> 02:35.834
THAT'S THE PRESIDENT'S OWN

02:35.900 --> 02:40.934
LAWYER TELLING A PROSECUTOR --

02:41.000 --> 02:41.633
A PROSECUTOR --

02:41.700 --> 02:42.734
THAT HIS CLIENT WOULD BE SO

02:42.800 --> 02:43.300
STUPID UNDER QUESTIONING IT

02:43.367 --> 02:43.867
WOULD BE A NATIONAL SECURITY

02:43.934 --> 02:44.400
CONCERN.

02:44.467 --> 02:45.467
WHILE DOWD ALSO DENIES THOSE

02:45.533 --> 02:46.100
COMMENTS, LET'S JUST APPRECIATE

02:46.166 --> 02:47.367
HOW CHARMING IT IS TO CALL

02:47.433 --> 02:51.834
ANYONE A "GODDAMN DUMBBELL."

02:51.900 --> 02:53.633
IT'S SO MUCH MORE DELIGHTFUL

02:53.700 --> 02:54.400
THAN "IDIOT" OR "DIPSHIT" OR

02:54.467 --> 02:55.066
"FUCKING MORON."

02:55.133 --> 02:55.767
"DUMBBELL" JUST PUTS A FUN

02:55.834 --> 02:56.500
CARTOON IMAGE IN YOUR HEAD.

02:56.567 --> 02:57.367
ANYWAY, THE PRESIDENT IS A

02:57.433 --> 02:58.133
DISASTER AND WE'RE ALL GOING TO

02:58.200 --> 02:59.066
DIE.

02:59.133 --> 03:00.233
MEANWHILE, THE WEEK WAS

03:00.300 --> 03:01.600
DOMINATED BY THE CONFIRMATION

03:01.667 --> 03:03.867
HEARINGS OF CONTROVERSIAL

03:03.934 --> 03:05.967
SUPREME COURT NOMINEE

03:06.033 --> 03:07.667
BRET KAVANAUGH.

03:07.734 --> 03:08.433
HE'S EXTREMELY CONSERVATIVE, AND

03:08.500 --> 03:09.066
WIDELY SEEN AS BEING A SERIOUS

03:09.133 --> 03:10.000
THREAT TO -- AMONG MANY OTHER

03:10.066 --> 03:11.033
THINGS -- ABORTION RIGHTS.

03:11.100 --> 03:11.967
THE PROBLEM IS, BEYOND A WILDLY

03:12.033 --> 03:17.800
IMPROBABLE DEFECTION,

03:17.867 --> 03:18.667
REPUBLICANS HAVE THE VOTES TO

03:18.734 --> 03:19.166
GET HIM CONFIRMED.

03:19.233 --> 03:20.433
AND ONE SIGN OF THAT IS, WHILE

03:20.500 --> 03:21.066
THE DEMOCRATS' QUESTIONING WAS

03:21.133 --> 03:21.700
FURIOUS, REPUBLICANS DIDN'T EVEN

03:21.767 --> 03:22.734
SEEM TO BE TRYING TO VET HIM.

03:22.800 --> 03:23.467
>> I DO, HOWEVER, HAVE A VERY

03:23.533 --> 03:24.533
IMPORTANT QUESTION FOR YOU.

03:24.600 --> 03:31.734
YOU USE A SHARPIE.

03:31.800 --> 03:32.667
AND IT'S NOT A FINE-TIP SHARPIE.

03:32.734 --> 03:33.767
IT'S A REGULAR SHARPIE THAT

03:33.834 --> 03:34.200
MIGHT SMUDGE.

03:34.266 --> 03:35.333
WHY DO YOU PREFER THAT PEN?

03:35.400 --> 03:36.567
I'M JUST DYING OF CURIOSITY.

03:36.633 --> 03:42.233
>> UH, SO I CAN SEE IT.

03:43.633 --> 03:44.900
IT'S NOTHING SCIENTIFIC.

03:44.967 --> 03:46.633
>> THAT IS A PERFECT MIC DROP

03:46.700 --> 03:48.100
MOMENT.

03:48.166 --> 03:51.467
>> John: IS IT?

03:51.533 --> 03:52.433
IS IT THOUGH?

03:52.500 --> 03:53.767
I DON'T THINK SENATOR MIKE LEE

03:53.834 --> 03:54.900
KNOWS WHAT A "MIC DROP" MOMENT

03:54.967 --> 03:55.734
IS.

03:55.800 --> 03:56.467
UNLESS HE MEANS A "MIKE DROP,"

03:56.533 --> 03:57.567
IN THE SENSE THAT

03:57.633 --> 03:58.367
"SENATOR MIKE LEE REALLY DROPPED

03:58.433 --> 03:59.800
THE CHARADE THAT HE GIVES A SHIT

03:59.867 --> 04:01.133
ABOUT DOING HIS JOB."

04:01.200 --> 04:04.834
IN WHICH CASE, YES, TOTAL

04:04.900 --> 04:08.767
MIKE DROP, MIKE.

04:08.834 --> 04:09.367
YOU REALLY DROPPED THAT ONE.

04:09.433 --> 04:10.567
PART OF THE CONCERN HERE IS THAT

04:10.633 --> 04:11.200
KAVANAUGH COULD BE ON THE COURT

04:11.266 --> 04:12.033
FOR DECADES.

04:12.100 --> 04:13.233
IT'S A LIFETIME APPOINTMENT.

04:13.300 --> 04:15.266
AND THIS MIGHT BE A GOOD TIME TO

04:15.333 --> 04:16.266
ASK WHY THAT IS THE CASE,

04:16.333 --> 04:17.400
BECAUSE IT'S EXTREMELY UNUSUAL.

04:17.467 --> 04:19.367
>> A LOT OF OTHER COUNTRIES

04:19.433 --> 04:20.734
FOLLOW OUR SUPREME COURT'S

04:20.800 --> 04:22.300
PATTERN OF VALIDATING LAWS.

04:22.367 --> 04:24.333
NONE OF THEM HAVE LIFE TENURE.

04:24.400 --> 04:25.567
THERE IS NOT A JUDGE IN THE

04:25.633 --> 04:26.633
WORLD IN ANY DEMOCRACY WHO SITS

04:26.700 --> 04:28.166
ON THE HIGHEST COURT OF THEIR

04:28.233 --> 04:29.900
LAND AND HAS LIFE TENURE.

04:29.967 --> 04:30.934
>> John: EXACTLY.

04:31.000 --> 04:32.367
LIFETIME APPOINTMENTS TO THE

04:32.433 --> 04:34.000
HIGHEST COURT IS ONE OF THOSE

04:34.066 --> 04:36.934
THINGS THAT'S UNIQUELY AMERICAN.

04:37.000 --> 04:38.900
LIKE THE SUPER BOWL OR DRINKING

04:38.967 --> 04:40.400
BUDWEISER OR TOLERATING

04:40.467 --> 04:41.200
SEAN PENN.

04:41.266 --> 04:42.166
NO ONE ELSE UNDERSTANDS WHY

04:42.233 --> 04:44.100
AMERICANS DO THOSE THINGS.

04:44.166 --> 04:45.000
AND IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT, IT IS

04:45.066 --> 04:45.867
A LITTLE WEIRD.

04:45.934 --> 04:47.300
FOR ONE THING, WHEN THE

04:47.367 --> 04:49.000
CONSTITUTION WAS WRITTEN, LIFE

04:49.066 --> 04:49.767
EXPECTANCY WAS MUCH SHORTER AND

04:49.834 --> 04:52.600
JUSTICES RETIRED MUCH YOUNGER.

04:52.667 --> 04:53.400
NOW THEY HANG AROUND FOR SO

04:53.467 --> 04:55.834
LONG THAT WHENEVER PEOPLE TALK

04:55.900 --> 04:58.033
ABOUT THEM, IT'S WITH A MORBID

04:58.100 --> 04:58.834
OVERTONE.

04:58.900 --> 04:59.600
>> I THINK IF YOU'RE A DEMOCRAT,

04:59.667 --> 05:00.533
YOU ARE PRAYING EVEN MORE FOR

05:00.600 --> 05:02.000
RUTH BADER GINSBURG AND HER

05:02.066 --> 05:02.300
HEALTH.

05:02.367 --> 05:03.700
>> RUTH BADER GINSBURG IS 83.

05:03.767 --> 05:04.467
EVERYBODY IS WATCHING HER

05:04.533 --> 05:05.633
CERTAINLY.

05:05.700 --> 05:06.300
>> PRESUMABLY GINSBERG AND

05:06.367 --> 05:07.767
BREYER WILL TRY TO LAST

05:07.834 --> 05:09.300
THROUGHOUT TRUMP'S TERM.

05:09.367 --> 05:10.700
BUT, YOU KNOW, 83 IS 83.

05:10.767 --> 05:11.834
SHE'S HAD A LOT OF HEALTH

05:11.900 --> 05:15.166
PROBLEMS.

05:15.233 --> 05:16.066
>> John: EXACTLY, PEOPLE ARE

05:16.133 --> 05:16.867
CONSTANTLY SPECULATING ON TV

05:16.934 --> 05:18.200
ABOUT RUTH BADER GINSBURG'S

05:18.266 --> 05:18.533
HEALTH.

05:18.600 --> 05:20.100
IT MAY BE WHY THE NEW

05:20.166 --> 05:21.166
DOCUMENTARY ABOUT HER

05:21.233 --> 05:22.700
PROMINENTLY FEATURES HER WORKOUT

05:22.767 --> 05:24.000
ROUTINE, WHICH -- DEPENDING ON

05:24.066 --> 05:25.066
YOUR PERSPECTIVE -- EITHER FILLS

05:25.133 --> 05:26.667
YOU WITH HOPE OR MAKES YOU WORRY

05:26.734 --> 05:28.200
THAT SHE MIGHT BE CRUSHED BY A

05:28.266 --> 05:30.033
GODDAMN DUMBBELL.

05:30.100 --> 05:33.000
HER PERSONAL TRAINER EVEN WROTE

05:33.066 --> 05:37.300
A BOOK CALLED "THE RBG WORKOUT."

05:37.367 --> 05:38.667
AND, LOOK, YOU MAY LAUGH, BUT

05:38.734 --> 05:40.233
I'VE TRIED IT, AND DO I OR DO I

05:40.300 --> 05:41.433
NOT HAVE THE MUSCLE TONE OF A

05:41.500 --> 05:43.667
BIRDLIKE ELDERLY WOMAN?

05:43.734 --> 05:44.233
EXACTLY.

05:44.300 --> 05:46.834
THE PROGRAM WORKS.

05:46.900 --> 05:47.734
AND, LOOK, THERE ARE LOTS OF

05:47.800 --> 05:48.734
PROPOSALS FOR HOW TERM LIMITS

05:48.800 --> 05:49.667
COULD WORK.

05:49.734 --> 05:50.633
UNDER ONE, JUSTICES WOULD SERVE

05:50.700 --> 05:51.834
18-YEAR TERMS, AND THEY'D BE

05:51.900 --> 05:52.867
SPACED OUT SO THAT EACH

05:52.934 --> 05:53.867
PRESIDENTIAL TERM WOULD BE

05:53.934 --> 05:55.066
GUARANTEED TWO PICKS.

05:55.133 --> 05:56.533
THAT KIND OF MAKES SENSE.

05:56.600 --> 05:57.567
AND INTERESTINGLY, THE ARGUMENTS

05:57.633 --> 06:00.633
AGAINST THIS ARE PRETTY WEAK.

06:00.700 --> 06:02.633
SOME CLAIM THIS WOULD POLITICIZE

06:02.700 --> 06:03.734
JUDICIAL APPOINTMENTS, A SHIP

06:03.800 --> 06:05.000
THAT I WOULD ARGUE HAS

06:05.066 --> 06:06.500
EMPHATICALLY SAILED AT THIS

06:06.567 --> 06:07.567
POINT.

06:07.633 --> 06:08.700
OTHERS ARGUE THAT JUSTICES

06:08.767 --> 06:12.500
ACCRUE WISDOM WITH EXPERIENCE.

06:12.567 --> 06:13.867
AND WHILE THAT CAN BE TRUE, YOU

06:13.934 --> 06:15.166
ALSO RUN THE RISK OF THEM

06:15.233 --> 06:16.834
STAYING PAST THE POINT THAT THEY

06:16.900 --> 06:18.700
CAN MENTALLY DO THEIR JOB, AND

06:18.767 --> 06:19.367
THAT HAS HAPPENED, AS ONE FORMER

06:19.433 --> 06:19.734
CLERK EXPLAINS.

06:19.800 --> 06:21.166
>> THE TERM I CLERKED, WHICH WAS

06:21.233 --> 06:22.667
THE LAST TERM OF CHIEF JUSTICE

06:22.734 --> 06:23.834
BURGER, I THINK SIX OF THE

06:23.900 --> 06:26.033
JUSTICES WERE IN THEIR 80s.

06:26.100 --> 06:27.500
AND I WILL TELL YOU, THEY WERE

06:27.567 --> 06:29.066
NOT ALL THERE.

06:29.133 --> 06:32.100
AND IT WAS NOT THAT THE LAW

06:32.166 --> 06:33.834
CLERKS STEPPED IN AND DID WHAT

06:33.900 --> 06:34.367
WE WANTED.

06:34.433 --> 06:34.867
WE DIDN'T.

06:34.934 --> 06:35.633
IN A WAY, THAT MIGHT'VE BEEN

06:35.700 --> 06:37.100
BETTER.

06:37.166 --> 06:38.233
WHAT WE DID IS, WE WOULD

06:38.300 --> 06:38.800
EXTRAPOLATE FROM THEIR PAST

06:38.867 --> 06:39.500
OPINIONS WHERE WE THOUGHT THEY

06:39.567 --> 06:40.133
WOULD WANT TO GO.

06:40.200 --> 06:40.934
>> John: NOW, JUST THINK ABOUT

06:41.033 --> 06:42.066
WHAT HE'S SAYING THERE.

06:42.133 --> 06:43.000
LAW CLERKS WERE REVERSE

06:43.066 --> 06:43.867
ENGINEERING DECISIONS BASED ON

06:43.934 --> 06:47.500
JUSTICES' PAST RULINGS.

06:47.567 --> 06:48.633
THAT IS NOT GOOD.

06:48.700 --> 06:49.767
YOU DON'T WANT HOSPITAL INTERNS

06:49.834 --> 06:50.734
SAYING TO A PATIENT, "LISTEN,

06:50.800 --> 06:51.867
THE DOCTOR'S A LITTLE OUT OF IT,

06:51.934 --> 06:53.166
BUT THE LAST TIME SOMEONE CAME

06:53.233 --> 06:54.467
IN HERE, HE AMPUTATED THEIR ARM,

06:54.533 --> 06:55.367
SO LET'S JUST GO WITH THAT,

06:55.433 --> 06:57.834
SHALL WE?"

06:57.900 --> 06:59.166
AND, LOOK, SOME ARGUE THAT IT

06:59.233 --> 07:00.667
WOULD JUST BE TOO DIFFICULT, AS

07:00.734 --> 07:01.300
IT MAY REQUIRE A CONSTITUTIONAL

07:01.367 --> 07:02.200
AMENDMENT.

07:02.266 --> 07:03.500
BUT OVER 60% OF VOTERS FAVOR

07:03.567 --> 07:05.100
TERM LIMITS, INCLUDING

07:05.166 --> 07:05.834
TWO-THIRDS OF DEMOCRATS AND 58%

07:05.900 --> 07:07.166
OF REPUBLICANS.

07:07.233 --> 07:08.667
AND I KNOW THAT AMENDING THE

07:08.734 --> 07:10.000
CONSTITUTION IS HARD.

07:10.066 --> 07:11.567
IT IS SUPPOSED TO BE HARD.

07:11.633 --> 07:13.200
BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT IT

07:13.266 --> 07:14.166
CAN'T BE DONE.

07:14.233 --> 07:15.467
YOU KNOW, A LONG TIME AGO,

07:15.533 --> 07:16.934
EVERYONE TOLD A CERTAIN BRITISH

07:17.000 --> 07:18.533
AUTHOR THAT A STORY ABOUT A

07:18.600 --> 07:19.133
DORKY LITTLE BOY WITH GLASSES

07:19.200 --> 07:20.633
GOING TO WIZARD SCHOOL WOULD

07:20.700 --> 07:21.767
NEVER WORK.

07:21.834 --> 07:23.066
BUT THOSE PEOPLE WERE WRONG.

07:23.133 --> 07:24.166
BECAUSE THAT BRITISH AUTHOR'S

07:24.233 --> 07:26.400
NAME WAS JOHN FUCKING OLIVER.

07:26.467 --> 07:27.500
THAT'S RIGHT.

07:27.567 --> 07:28.667
THAT'S RIGHT.

HAVE.

07:40.033 --> 07:42.000
THE POINT IS, SEEING AS MOST OF

07:42.066 --> 07:43.533
AMERICANS WANT SUPREME COURT

09:20.734 --> 09:21.700
SORRY, EDGAR, BUT THE CATEGORY

09:21.767 --> 09:23.433
WAS "THING," SO THE ANSWER WE

09:23.500 --> 09:24.633
WERE LOOKING FOR WAS

09:24.700 --> 09:25.567
"FISH LUBE."

09:25.633 --> 09:27.100
THE THING YOU USE WHEN YOU WANT

09:28.066 --> 09:33.066
BETTER LUCK NEXT TIME, EDGAR.

FISH-FUCKER MAY

09:34.533 --> 09:35.533
BE ABLE TO CAST A VOTE, A

09:35.600 --> 09:36.667
SURPRISINGLY LARGE AMOUNT OF

09:36.734 --> 09:38.300
PEOPLE ARE BARRED FROM DOING SO.

09:38.367 --> 09:39.066
>>IT'S ESTIMATED THAT MORE THAN

09:39.133 --> 09:40.967
SIX MILLION AMERICANS ARE BARRED

09:41.033 --> 09:41.567
FROM VOTING BECAUSE OF FELONY

>> John: IT'S TRUE, 6 MILLION

09:50.667 --> 09:51.333
PEOPLE ARE UNABLE TO VOTE

09:51.400 --> 09:52.166
BECAUSE AT SOME POINT IN THEIR

09:52.233 --> 09:52.867
LIFE, THEY COMMITTED A FELONY.

09:52.934 --> 09:53.600
THAT'S A LOT.

09:53.667 --> 09:54.700
FOR PERSPECTIVE, THAT'S LIKE IF

09:54.767 --> 09:55.266
YOU TOOK ALL THE PEOPLE WHO

09:55.333 --> 09:56.033
BOUGHT A COPY OF ROBIN THICKE'S

09:56.100 --> 10:00.400
DIVORCE OPERA, "PAULA," AND THEN

10:00.467 --> 10:01.166
ADDED ALMOST 6 MILLION MORE

10:01.233 --> 10:02.066
PEOPLE.

10:02.133 --> 10:02.734
AND IF ANY OF YOU ARE THINKING,

10:02.800 --> 10:03.800
"WELL, WHO REALLY GIVES A SHIT

10:03.867 --> 10:08.533
IF CONVICTED FELONS CAN'T

10:09.200 --> 10:09.967
BE ALONE.

10:10.033 --> 10:10.767
>> IF THEY COMMITTED CRIMES, ARE

10:14.000 --> 10:14.500

10:15.367 --> 10:15.934
SOCIETY WHERE THERE ARE NO

10:17.400 --> 10:18.767
>> I JUST THINK THAT THEY'VE

10:18.834 --> 10:19.400
DONE SOMETHING WRONG, SO I DON'T

10:19.467 --> 10:20.166
REALLY THINK THEY SHOULD BE

10:20.233 --> 10:21.000
ALLOWED TO BE VOTING IN OUR

10:21.066 --> 10:26.834
PRESIDENT AND STUFF LIKE THAT.

10:26.900 --> 10:29.600
>> John: OH.

10:29.667 --> 10:30.066
OH, YOU DON'T, DO YOU?

10:30.133 --> 10:30.834
YOU THINK, IF SOMEONE MAKES A

10:30.900 --> 10:31.533
MISTAKE, IT SHOULD FOLLOW THEM

10:31.600 --> 10:32.367
FOR THE REST OF THEIR LIFE --

10:32.433 --> 10:33.066
WHETHER THEY WERE CONVICTED OF

10:33.133 --> 10:34.467
MARIJUANA POSSESSION OR WENT TO

10:34.533 --> 10:35.066
BRUNCH DRESSED LIKE A TJ MAXX

10:35.133 --> 10:36.233
JANIS JOPLIN?

10:36.300 --> 10:36.700
I GET IT.

10:36.767 --> 10:37.767
I GET IT.

10:37.834 --> 10:40.367
BUT THE FACT IS, MANY LAWMAKERS

10:40.433 --> 10:42.834
AGREE WITH HER.

10:42.900 --> 10:44.100
HERE'S MITCH McCONNELL ARGUING

10:44.166 --> 10:45.266
THAT KEEPING FELONS FROM VOTING

10:45.333 --> 10:45.867
IS A PUBLIC SAFETY ISSUE.

10:45.934 --> 10:46.834
>> WE ARE TALKING ABOUT RAPISTS,

10:46.900 --> 10:47.433
MURDERERS, ROBBERS, AND EVEN

10:47.500 --> 10:48.200
TERRORISTS OR SPIES.

10:48.266 --> 10:49.467
DO WE WANT TO SEE CONVICTED

10:49.533 --> 10:50.066
TERRORISTS WHO SEEK TO DESTROY

10:50.133 --> 10:50.967
THIS COUNTRY VOTING IN

10:51.033 --> 10:53.433
ELECTIONS?

10:53.500 --> 10:54.800
>> John: OKAY, FIRST, TERRORISTS

10:54.867 --> 10:57.800
ARE NOT VOTING.

10:57.867 --> 10:58.667
ARE THEY?

10:58.734 --> 10:59.233
THEY'RE ABOUT MAKING GIANT,

10:59.300 --> 11:00.133
VIOLENT POINTS THAT GET

11:00.200 --> 11:00.967
EVERYONE'S ATTENTION, NOT LINING

11:01.033 --> 11:02.400
UP IN A PUBLIC SCHOOL GYMNASIUM

11:02.467 --> 11:03.033
TO WRITE IN "ISIS" FOR THE

11:03.100 --> 11:05.000
SCHOOL BOARD.

11:05.066 --> 11:06.400
AND SECOND, THE MOST RECENT

11:06.467 --> 11:08.100
ANALYSIS FOUND ONLY 18% OF

11:08.166 --> 11:09.433
FELONY CONVICTIONS WERE FOR

11:09.500 --> 11:11.433
VIOLENT CRIMES OF ANY SORT.

11:11.500 --> 11:13.266
MEANING THE VAST MAJORITY WERE

11:13.333 --> 11:13.867
FOR NON-VIOLENT OFFENSES LIKE

11:13.934 --> 11:15.700
PROPERTY OR DRUG CRIMES.

11:15.767 --> 11:18.200
AND FOR THOSE WHO'VE SERVED

11:18.266 --> 11:19.033
THEIR SENTENCE BUT ARE STILL

11:19.100 --> 11:20.400
UNABLE TO VOTE, THIS SITUATION

11:20.467 --> 11:21.767
IS UNDERSTANDABLY FRUSTRATING.

11:21.834 --> 11:23.400
>> AT WHAT POINT DO WE BREAK THE

11:23.467 --> 11:24.700
CYCLE?

11:24.767 --> 11:25.734
AT WHAT POINT ARE WE ABLE TO

11:25.800 --> 11:27.166
SAY, YOU KNOW WHAT?

11:27.233 --> 11:29.266
I AM CITIZEN ENOUGH.

11:29.333 --> 11:30.100
YOU WANT ME TO WORK, YOU WANT ME

11:30.166 --> 11:31.500
TO PAY TAXES, YOU WANT ME TO

11:31.567 --> 11:35.066
MAKE SURE I TAKE CARE OF MY

11:35.133 --> 11:36.033
FAMILY, BUT YET I CAN'T VOTE.

11:36.100 --> 11:37.633
SO AM I CITIZEN OR AM I NOT A

11:37.700 --> 11:41.266
CITIZEN?

11:41.333 --> 11:43.867
>> John: YEAH, HE'S GOT A POINT,

11:43.934 --> 11:44.600
BECAUSE THAT MAN IS

11:44.667 --> 11:45.300
SUFFERING TAXATION WITHOUT

11:45.367 --> 11:46.400
REPRESENTATION.

11:46.467 --> 11:47.166
AND HISTORICALLY, THAT'S BEEN A

11:47.233 --> 11:48.066
STICKING POINT FOR AMERICA.

11:48.133 --> 11:48.700
I'M PRETTY SURE I LEARNED ABOUT

11:48.767 --> 11:50.166
THAT IN SCHOOL -- SOMETHING

11:50.233 --> 11:50.734
ABOUT "THE AMERICAN SAVAGES

11:50.800 --> 11:51.500
THREW TEA INTO THE WATER WITHOUT

11:51.567 --> 11:52.867
EVEN HAVING THE DECENCY TO ADD A

11:52.934 --> 11:56.700
SPLASH OF MILK."

11:56.767 --> 11:59.633
SO TONIGHT, LET'S LOOK AT FELONY

11:59.700 --> 12:01.400
DISENFRANCHISEMENT, AND ONE

12:01.467 --> 12:02.367
STATE IN PARTICULAR, BECAUSE THE

12:02.433 --> 12:03.300
6 MILLION DISENFRANCHISED VOTERS

12:03.367 --> 12:04.633
ARE NOT EVENLY DISTRIBUTED

12:04.700 --> 12:14.433
AROUND THE COUNTRY.

12:14.500 --> 12:15.300
IN MOST STATES, PEOPLE WITH

12:15.367 --> 12:17.066
FELONY CONVICTIONS AUTOMATICALLY

12:17.133 --> 12:17.667
REGAIN THEIR VOTING RIGHTS AT

12:17.734 --> 12:18.133
SOME POINT.

12:18.200 --> 12:19.066
THERE ARE ONLY A FEW WHERE THEY

12:19.133 --> 12:19.367
DON'T.

12:19.433 --> 12:20.133
AND THE WORST STATE OF ALL

12:20.200 --> 12:20.934
CONCERNING THIS -- AND ARGUABLY

12:21.000 --> 12:22.066
EVERYTHING ELSE -- IS FLORIDA.

12:22.133 --> 12:22.667
AROUND 1.5 MILLION OF ITS

12:22.734 --> 12:23.533
CITIZENS, NEARLY 10% OF ITS

12:23.600 --> 12:24.433
ADULT POPULATION, HAVE COMPLETED

12:24.500 --> 12:26.100
SENTENCES FOR FELONY CONVICTIONS

12:26.166 --> 12:26.567
BUT STILL CAN'T VOTE.

12:26.633 --> 12:27.700
AND GIVEN THE INEQUITIES OF OUR

12:27.767 --> 12:29.233
JUSTICE SYSTEM, THAT BURDEN IS

12:29.300 --> 12:30.066
DISPROPORTIONATELY FELT BY

12:30.133 --> 12:31.166
AFRICAN-AMERICANS, BECAUSE IN

12:31.233 --> 12:32.367
FLORIDA, OVER ONE IN FIVE BLACK

12:32.433 --> 12:35.567
ADULTS CANNOT VOTE.

12:35.633 --> 12:38.367
IT'S STAGGERING.

12:38.433 --> 12:40.200
IT MAY BE THE DUMBEST THING

12:40.266 --> 12:42.900
ABOUT FLORIDA, WHICH IS

12:42.967 --> 12:44.200
FRANKLY IMPRESSIVE, CONSIDERING

12:44.266 --> 12:46.100
STORIES LIKE THESE.

12:46.166 --> 12:47.467
>> ONLY IN FLORIDA WOULD AN

12:47.533 --> 12:48.734

12:48.800 --> 12:50.567

AND I DRANK A LOT OF IT THAT

13:19.834 --> 13:21.834
NIGHT.

13:21.900 --> 13:26.000
>> John: OKAY, EVERYTHING ABOUT

13:26.066 --> 13:26.533
THAT GUY IS ABSOLUTELY

13:26.600 --> 13:27.300
FASCINATING, BUT I'M MOST

13:27.367 --> 13:29.900
INTERESTED IN THE FACT THAT HE

13:29.967 --> 13:31.100
WAS DRUNK AT THE STORE WHERE HE

13:31.166 --> 13:31.934
BOUGHT THE LIQUOR.

13:32.000 --> 13:32.834
DID HE BUY THE LIQUOR, LEAVE,

13:32.900 --> 13:34.000
DRINK IT, FETCH AN ALLIGATOR,

13:34.066 --> 13:34.567
AND THEN RETURN TO THE SAME

13:34.633 --> 13:35.133
STORE?

13:35.200 --> 13:36.300
DID HE DRINK THE LIQUOR AT THE

13:36.367 --> 13:37.200
STORE, AT WHICH POINT AN

13:37.266 --> 13:38.700
ALLIGATOR WALKED IN?

13:38.767 --> 13:40.100
OR DID HE GET DRUNK AND THEN

13:40.166 --> 13:41.734
MEET A SOBER ALLIGATOR WHO WAS

13:41.800 --> 13:43.200
HAVING A BAD DAY, WANTED TO HAVE

13:43.266 --> 13:48.200
A COUPLE OF DRINKS, AND THE GUY

13:48.266 --> 13:48.934
SAID, "I KNOW JUST THE PLACE,

13:49.000 --> 13:49.800
ALLIGATOR"?

13:49.867 --> 13:50.333
I DON'T KNOW.

13:50.400 --> 13:51.300
IT'S FLORIDA, SO ALL OPTIONS ARE

13:51.367 --> 13:55.867
EQUALLY PLAUSIBLE.

13:55.934 --> 13:57.633
HERE'S THE THING, THE POINT IS,

13:57.700 --> 13:59.433
DISENFRANCHISEMENT CAPITOL OF

13:59.934 --> 14:00.500
FLORIDA IS THE

14:00.567 --> 14:01.400
DISENFRANCHISEMENT CAPITOL OF

14:01.467 --> 14:04.266
AMERICA.

14:04.333 --> 14:05.100
SO HOW DID THAT HAPPEN?

14:05.166 --> 14:05.834
WELL, FOR STARTERS, A

14:05.900 --> 14:07.033
POST-CIVIL WAR CHANGE TO THEIR

14:07.100 --> 14:07.567
CONSTITUTION STRIPPED ALL

14:07.633 --> 14:08.200
CONVICTED FELONS OF THEIR VOTING

14:08.266 --> 14:08.567
RIGHTS FOR LIFE.

14:08.633 --> 14:09.233
AND WHILE FLORIDA'S GOVERNOR CAN

14:09.300 --> 14:10.100
RESTORE THOSE RIGHTS, THE

14:10.166 --> 14:10.767
CURRENT ONE, RICK SCOTT --

14:10.834 --> 14:11.734
SEEN HERE AUDITIONING FOR THE

14:11.800 --> 14:14.333
ROLE OF "HAPPY PENCIL" IN ALL MY

14:14.400 --> 14:14.934
NIGHTMARES -- HE HAS MADE THIS

14:15.000 --> 14:15.533
PROCESS MUCH MORE DIFFICULT.

14:15.600 --> 14:16.266
BECAUSE WHILE THE GOVERNOR

14:16.333 --> 14:17.300
BEFORE HIM MADE REGAINING VOTING

14:17.367 --> 14:23.233
RIGHTS CLOSE TO AUTOMATIC FOR

14:23.300 --> 14:23.867
MANY NON-VIOLENT OFFENSES, SCOTT

14:23.934 --> 14:24.834
IMPLEMENTED A SYSTEM WHERE YOU

14:24.900 --> 14:25.700
HAVE TO WAIT FIVE TO SEVEN YEARS

14:25.767 --> 14:26.600
JUST TO APPLY TO GET YOUR VOTE

14:26.667 --> 14:27.266
BACK.

14:27.333 --> 14:28.367
THEN SUBMIT AN APPLICATION.

14:28.433 --> 14:30.900
THEN WAIT MORE.

14:30.967 --> 14:32.066
THEN, IN MANY CASES, HAVE TO

14:32.133 --> 14:32.834
TRAVEL TO TALLAHASSEE --

14:32.900 --> 14:34.200
WHICH NO ONE SHOULD EVER HAVE TO

14:34.266 --> 14:34.967
DO, UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES --

14:35.033 --> 14:35.900
TO ARGUE YOUR CASE IN PERSON.

14:35.967 --> 14:37.100
THESE OBSTACLES ARE RIDICULOUS

14:37.166 --> 14:38.200
AND UNNECESSARY, AND THIS IS HOW

14:38.266 --> 14:41.033
SCOTT JUSTIFIED THEM.

14:41.100 --> 14:42.500
>> LOOK, IF YOU ARE A CONVICTED

14:42.567 --> 14:43.400
FELON, PART OF WHAT YOU DID IS,

14:43.467 --> 14:46.700
YOU LOST YOUR RIGHTS.

14:46.767 --> 14:47.700
AND SO YOU OUGHT TO -- YOU KNOW,

14:47.767 --> 14:48.633
THERE OUGHT TO BE A PROCESS IF

14:48.700 --> 14:49.900
YOU'RE GOING TO GET THOSE RIGHTS

14:49.967 --> 14:50.667
BACK.

14:50.734 --> 14:51.900
AND I THINK IT'S FAIR TO THE

14:51.967 --> 14:53.900
REST OF THE CITIZENS IN THE

14:53.967 --> 14:54.934
STATE, AND THEY'LL SEE A PROCESS

14:55.000 --> 15:00.066
THAT THEY KNOW WILL WORK.

15:00.133 --> 15:01.600
>> John: RIGHT, EXCEPT THERE IS

15:01.667 --> 15:03.000
A PROCESS FOR PAYING YOUR DEBT

15:03.066 --> 15:04.500
TO SOCIETY AND GETTING YOUR

15:04.567 --> 15:05.233
RIGHTS BACK.

15:05.300 --> 15:05.900
IT'S CALLED "SERVING YOUR

15:05.967 --> 15:06.600
FUCKING SENTENCE."

15:06.667 --> 15:07.367
YOU'RE JUST TAGGING SHIT ON THE

15:07.433 --> 15:08.467
END.

15:08.533 --> 15:09.633
IT'S LIKE SOMEONE FINISHING A

15:09.700 --> 15:11.667
TRIATHLON, ONLY FOR SCOTT TO

15:11.734 --> 15:13.467
THEN SAY, "IT'S A QUAD-ATHLON.

15:13.533 --> 15:14.467
NOW YOU HAVE TO LEARN MANDARIN."

15:14.533 --> 15:18.967
IT DOESN'T SEEM FAIR.

15:19.033 --> 15:24.166
AND IT'S HONESTLY WORTH TAKING A

15:24.233 --> 15:25.367
LOOK AT THIS PROCESS, BECAUSE

15:25.433 --> 15:25.967
IT'S INSANE.

15:26.033 --> 15:26.667
APPLICATIONS ARE JUDGED BY A

15:26.734 --> 15:27.367
CLEMENCY BOARD MADE UP OF

15:27.433 --> 15:28.066
RICK SCOTT AND MEMBERS OF HIS

15:28.133 --> 15:28.700
CABINET, SEEN HERE LOOKING LIKE

15:28.767 --> 15:29.967
THE ONLY LOCAL NEWS TEAM YOU

15:30.033 --> 15:30.600
SOMEHOW KNOW AREN'T FUCKING EACH

15:30.667 --> 15:33.667
OTHER.

15:33.734 --> 15:34.400
AND IF YOU DO END UP IN FRONT OF

15:34.467 --> 15:35.166
THEM, YOU'RE GIVEN TEN MINUTES

15:35.233 --> 15:36.033
TO PROVE YOU'VE TURNED YOUR LIFE

15:36.100 --> 15:36.934
AROUND.

15:37.000 --> 15:37.633
THEY THEN QUESTION YOU BEFORE

15:37.700 --> 15:38.633
MAKING A DECISION THAT SEEMS

15:38.700 --> 15:43.266
COMPLETELY ARBITRARY.

15:43.333 --> 15:44.000
AND IT SEEMS THAT WAY

15:44.066 --> 15:44.600
BECAUSE IT IS.

15:44.667 --> 15:46.600
SCOTT BEGINS MEETINGS BY MAKING

15:46.667 --> 15:47.066
THAT PAINFULLY CLEAR.

15:47.133 --> 15:48.633
>> THIS IS A BOARD OF CLEMENCY.

15:48.700 --> 15:49.967
OKAY?

15:50.033 --> 15:51.233
THERE IS NO LAW WE'RE FOLLOWING.

15:51.300 --> 15:52.433
THE LAW HAD ALREADY BEEN

15:52.500 --> 15:54.266
FOLLOWED BY THE JUDGES.

15:54.333 --> 15:55.567
SO WE GET TO MAKE OUR DECISIONS

15:55.633 --> 15:57.900
BASED ON OUR OWN BELIEFS.

15:57.967 --> 15:59.467
THERE'S NO STANDARDS.

15:59.533 --> 16:00.800
EACH OF US HAVE THE RIGHT

16:00.867 --> 16:01.934
OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE A DECISION

16:02.000 --> 16:03.233
BASED ON WHAT WE BELIEVE.

16:03.300 --> 16:05.400
THIS IS A COURT OF MERCY.

16:05.467 --> 16:07.100
IT'S NOT A COURT --

16:07.166 --> 16:08.567
THERE'S NO -- IF YOU WALK UP AND

16:08.633 --> 16:09.867
SAY, "I DESERVE SOMETHING,"

16:09.934 --> 16:11.967
THAT'S NOT HOW THIS WORKS.

16:12.033 --> 16:13.900
WE -- THERE'S NO -- THERE'S

16:13.967 --> 16:16.400
ABSOLUTELY NO STANDARDS.

16:16.467 --> 16:18.300
SO WE CAN MAKE ANY DECISION WE

16:18.367 --> 16:20.834
WANT.

16:20.900 --> 16:22.667
>> John: YOU KNOW, I'M SURE

16:22.734 --> 16:30.834
THAT'S TRUE, IT'S JUST WEIRD TO

16:30.900 --> 16:31.700
HEAR IT SAID OUT LOUD, IN THE

16:31.767 --> 16:32.367
WAY IT'D BE WEIRD

16:32.433 --> 16:33.066
TO HEAR THE CEO OF KRAFT SAY,

16:33.133 --> 16:33.834
"WE DON'T ACTUALLY KNOW WHAT

16:33.900 --> 16:34.500
VELVEETA IS.

16:34.567 --> 16:35.266
IT FELL FROM SPACE IN THE '50s

16:35.333 --> 16:36.400
AND HAS BEEN SPAWNING IN A LAB

16:36.467 --> 16:36.800
EVER SINCE.

16:36.867 --> 16:38.333
BEFORE WE PACKAGE IT, WE TAKE

16:38.400 --> 16:38.900
OUT THE TEETH AND EYES, BUT

16:38.967 --> 16:39.500
WE'RE STARTING TO THINK THAT

16:39.567 --> 16:40.266
MAKES IT ANGRY."

16:40.333 --> 16:41.033
AND BECAUSE THERE ARE NO FORMAL

16:41.100 --> 16:42.000
STANDARDS, THE COMMITTEE CAN

16:42.066 --> 16:43.266
DECIDE WHAT'S IMPORTANT AND CAN

16:43.333 --> 16:43.834
FOCUS ON THINGS AS PETTY AS

16:43.900 --> 16:44.734
MOVING VIOLATIONS.

16:44.800 --> 16:48.433
>> WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO FIGURE

16:48.500 --> 16:49.300
OUT IS, IS THAT HAVE PEOPLE

16:49.367 --> 16:50.367
CHANGED THEIR LIVES?

16:50.433 --> 16:53.533
RIGHT?

16:53.600 --> 16:55.467
>> RIGHT.

16:55.533 --> 16:56.800
>> AND THAT'S -- SO, SO, GETTING

16:56.867 --> 16:57.967
TRAFFIC TICKETS ALL THE TIME,

16:58.033 --> 16:59.333
TO -- IF YOU SIT UP HERE, YOUR

16:59.400 --> 17:00.200
FIRST REACTION IS, WELL, DO THEY

17:00.266 --> 17:04.400
REALLY RESPECT THE LAW, RIGHT?

17:04.467 --> 17:06.000
>> John: RIGHT.

17:06.066 --> 17:06.800
I MEAN, THAT MIGHT BE YOUR

17:06.867 --> 17:07.533
FIRST REACTION.

17:07.600 --> 17:08.667
MY FIRST REACTION IS, WHY ARE

17:08.734 --> 17:09.567
RICK SCOTT'S GLASSES NOT NEAR

17:09.633 --> 17:18.934
THE EYES PART OF HIS HEAD?

17:19.000 --> 17:19.567
AND HOW HAVE THEY NOT FALLEN OFF

17:19.633 --> 17:20.200
HIS NOSE BY NOW?

17:20.266 --> 17:20.934
AND IT'S NOT JUST YOUR DRIVING

17:21.000 --> 17:22.166
RECORD UNDER SCRUTINY.

17:22.233 --> 17:23.100
YOUR PERSONAL LIFE IS VERY MUCH

17:23.166 --> 17:23.667
ON THE TABLE, AND ONE BOARD

17:23.734 --> 17:24.333
MEMBER, FLORIDA CFO

17:24.400 --> 17:25.667
JIMMY PATRONIS, SEEMS TO HAVE A

17:25.734 --> 17:26.600
SPECIFIC IDEA OF WHERE THAT

17:26.667 --> 17:27.400
PERSONAL LIFE SHOULD BE

17:27.467 --> 17:29.900
CONDUCTED, BECAUSE THERE'S ONE

17:29.967 --> 17:30.467
QUESTION THAT HE ASKS A LOT.

17:30.533 --> 17:31.233
>> Y'ALL GO TO CHURCH?

17:31.300 --> 17:31.967
Y'ALL GO TO CHURCH?

17:32.033 --> 17:32.700
DO Y'ALL GO TO THE CHURCH

17:32.767 --> 17:33.500
TOGETHER?

17:33.567 --> 17:34.367
MA'AM, WHERE DO Y'ALL GO TO

17:34.433 --> 17:35.100
CHURCH?

17:35.166 --> 17:36.967
DO YOU GO TO CHURCH?

17:37.033 --> 17:38.000
AND GO TO CHURCH?

17:38.066 --> 17:42.667
>> John: "DO YOU GO TO CHURCH?"

17:42.734 --> 17:44.033
NOW, IF THE ANSWER TO THAT

17:44.100 --> 17:44.700
QUESTION IS IMPORTANT, THAT'S

17:44.767 --> 17:45.567
FUCKED UP.

17:45.633 --> 17:46.133
AND IF IT'S NOT, WHY ARE YOU

17:46.200 --> 17:47.200
CONSTANTLY ASKING IT?

17:47.266 --> 17:47.700
EITHER YOU'RE FACTORING

17:47.767 --> 17:48.367
RELIGIOUS HABITS INTO YOUR

17:48.433 --> 17:49.266
EVALUATION OF WHETHER SOMEONE

17:49.333 --> 17:50.266
SHOULD BE ABLE TO VOTE OR YOU'RE

17:50.333 --> 17:51.400
MAKING A LIST OF PEOPLE'S HOUSES

17:51.467 --> 17:52.400
THAT WOULD BE EASY TO ROB ON A

17:52.467 --> 17:54.467
SUNDAY MORNING.

17:54.533 --> 17:55.133
AND NEITHER IS A GOOD USE OF THE

17:55.200 --> 17:58.133
PANEL'S TIME.

17:58.200 --> 18:00.166
AND ONCE YOU'VE JUMPED THROUGH

18:00.233 --> 18:02.066
ALL OF THESE HOOPS, YOUR FATE IS

18:02.133 --> 18:02.867
IN THE HANDS OF A PANEL WHO DO

18:02.934 --> 18:04.734
NOT HAVE TO EXPLAIN THEIR

18:04.800 --> 18:05.133
REASONING TO YOU.

18:05.200 --> 18:08.100
JUST WATCH LEON GILLIS.

18:08.166 --> 18:09.400
HE HAD SERVED TIME FOR ROBBERY

18:09.467 --> 18:10.800
AND DRUG CONVICTIONS BUT HAD

18:10.867 --> 18:11.934
BEEN CLEAN FOR EIGHT YEARS AND

18:12.000 --> 18:12.667
WAS RUNNING A DRUG REHAB PROGRAM

18:12.734 --> 18:13.700
WHEN HE MADE HIS CASE TO THE

18:13.767 --> 18:15.000
BOARD IN 2011.

18:15.066 --> 18:18.266
RICK SCOTT ACTUALLY COMMENDED

18:18.333 --> 18:19.633
HIM FOR THE PROGRESS THAT HE'D

18:19.700 --> 18:20.300
MADE, THEN SAID THIS.

18:20.367 --> 18:21.700
>> SO AT THIS POINT I'M GOING TO

18:21.767 --> 18:22.934
DENY RESTORATION OF

18:23.000 --> 18:24.467
CIVIL RIGHTS.

18:24.533 --> 18:26.633
>> CAN I ASK YOU A QUESTION?

18:26.700 --> 18:27.967
>> YES, SIR.

18:28.033 --> 18:28.867
>> HOW LONG IS THAT?

18:28.934 --> 18:31.300
>> I'M NOT SURE.

18:31.367 --> 18:32.367
I, UM, YOU KNOW, UM -- I THINK

18:32.433 --> 18:35.200
EVERY CASE IS DIFFERENT.

18:35.266 --> 18:36.266
>> WELL, WHAT SHOULD I DO WITH

18:36.333 --> 18:37.867
MY LIFE THEN?

18:37.934 --> 18:40.367
IF I'M DOING EVERYTHING I'M

18:40.433 --> 18:42.333
SUPPOSED TO DO AND I'M TRYING --

18:42.400 --> 18:44.000
AND I'M MAKING SURE THAT I DO

18:44.066 --> 18:45.800
THE RIGHT THING I'M SUPPOSED TO

18:45.867 --> 18:47.300
DO, THEN HOW LONG AM I SUPPOSED

18:47.367 --> 18:48.033
TO WAIT?

18:48.100 --> 18:50.600
>> I COULDN'T TELL YOU THAT

18:50.667 --> 18:51.533
ANSWER, BUT IF -- TODAY I DON'T

18:51.600 --> 18:52.100
FEEL COMFORTABLE DOING IT.

18:52.166 --> 18:53.400
>> OKAY.

18:53.467 --> 18:54.700
THANK YOU, SIR.

18:54.767 --> 18:55.834
>> John: AND THAT WAS IT.

18:55.900 --> 18:56.633
HE REFUSED TO RESTORE SOMEONE'S

18:56.700 --> 18:57.800
CIVIL RIGHTS WITHOUT

18:57.867 --> 19:03.834
DEMONSTRATING MUCH MORE OF A

19:03.900 --> 19:05.100
REASON THAN, "I DUNNO, I GUESS

19:05.166 --> 19:05.967
I'M JUST NOT FEELING IT RIGHT

19:06.033 --> 19:06.266
NOW."

19:06.333 --> 19:07.266
AND THE THING IS, EVEN IF THIS

19:07.333 --> 19:12.500
PROCESS WAS PERFECT --

19:12.567 --> 19:13.266
WHICH IT'S NOT -- IT CAN'T

19:13.333 --> 19:14.200
HANDLE THE VOLUME.

19:14.266 --> 19:14.834
IT ONLY MEETS FOUR TIMES A YEAR,

19:14.900 --> 19:15.467
AND THERE ARE TOO MANY REQUESTS

19:15.533 --> 19:15.967
FOR THEM TO CATCH UP ON.

19:16.033 --> 19:16.734
ALSO, WHILE SCOTT'S PREDECESSOR

19:16.800 --> 19:17.500
RESTORED THE VOTING RIGHTS OF

19:17.567 --> 19:18.400
OVER 155,000 PEOPLE IN HIS

19:18.467 --> 19:19.333
FOUR-YEAR TERM, SCOTT IS ONLY

19:19.400 --> 19:22.266
AVERAGING AROUND 400 A YEAR.

19:22.333 --> 19:23.033
AND THAT IS MEANINGFUL,

19:23.100 --> 19:26.567
ESPECIALLY IN A STATE WHERE

19:26.633 --> 19:30.834
ELECTIONS TEND TO HAVE VERY

19:30.900 --> 19:33.300
NARROW MARGINS.

19:33.367 --> 19:34.800
PRESIDENT BUSH FAMOUSLY WON IT

19:34.867 --> 19:35.033
BY 537.

19:35.100 --> 19:35.900
BUT THERE'S ACTUALLY SOME GOOD

19:35.967 --> 19:36.800
NEWS HERE.

19:36.867 --> 19:37.734
FLORIDA HAS A CHANCE TO FIX

19:37.800 --> 19:41.300
THIS.

19:41.367 --> 19:41.900
A REAL CHANCE.

19:41.967 --> 19:42.633
THERE IS A CONSTITUTIONAL

19:42.700 --> 19:43.266
AMENDMENT ON THEIR BALLOT THIS

19:43.333 --> 19:44.500
NOVEMBER THAT WOULD BRING

19:44.567 --> 19:45.133
FLORIDA IN LINE WITH MANY OTHER

19:45.200 --> 19:45.800
STATES.

19:45.867 --> 19:47.633
IF IT PASSES, PEOPLE WITH FELONY

19:47.700 --> 19:49.467
CONVICTIONS, EXCEPT IN CASES OF

19:49.533 --> 19:50.100
MURDER OR SEX CRIMES, WOULD GET

19:50.166 --> 19:50.934
THE RIGHT TO VOTE AFTER

19:51.000 --> 19:52.700
COMPLETING THEIR SENTENCE.

19:52.767 --> 19:54.233
THAT COULD GIVE AS MANY AS

19:54.300 --> 19:55.467
1.4 MILLION PEOPLE THE RIGHT TO

19:55.533 --> 19:58.567
VOTE.

19:58.633 --> 19:59.367
BUT IT IS BY NO MEANS A FOREGONE

19:59.433 --> 20:00.133
CONCLUSION.

20:00.200 --> 20:01.433
THE AMENDMENT NEEDS A 60%

20:01.500 --> 20:05.900
MAJORITY TO PASS.

20:05.967 --> 20:08.133
SO IF IT'S OKAY WITH EVERYBODY,

20:08.200 --> 20:08.767
I'D LIKE TO SPEAK TO THE PEOPLE

20:08.834 --> 20:11.000
OF FLORIDA FOR A SECOND.

20:11.066 --> 20:14.000
HI THERE, FLORIDA.

20:14.066 --> 20:18.900
LET'S TRY AND GET COMFORTABLE

20:18.967 --> 20:20.000
WITH EACH OTHER, SHALL WE?

20:20.066 --> 20:23.133
I KNOW WE MAKE FUN OF YOU A LOT,

20:23.200 --> 20:25.033
FLORIDA, BECAUSE OF ALL THE

20:25.100 --> 20:25.800
STUPID THINGS THAT HAPPEN WHERE

20:25.867 --> 20:26.133
YOU LIVE.

20:26.200 --> 20:27.500
AND YOU'RE PROBABLY EXPECTING ME

20:27.567 --> 20:28.834
TO STEER AWAY FROM THAT AND

20:28.900 --> 20:29.433
APPEAL TO YOUR INNATE GOODNESS

20:29.500 --> 20:32.967
AND SENSE OF REASON.

20:33.033 --> 20:35.367
BUT I'M NOT GOING TO DO THAT.

20:35.433 --> 20:36.533
INSTEAD, I'D LIKE TO DOUBLE

20:36.600 --> 20:37.066
DOWN AND SUGGEST THAT IT'S

20:37.133 --> 20:37.700
PRECISELY BECAUSE OF ALL THAT

20:37.767 --> 20:38.633
GLORIOUS STUPIDITY THAT YOU

20:38.700 --> 20:39.633
SHOULD INNATELY APPRECIATE THE

20:39.700 --> 20:41.433
VALUE OF SECOND CHANCES.

20:41.500 --> 20:43.400
I MEAN, COME ON, FLORIDA, YOU'RE

20:43.467 --> 20:45.567
FLORIDA, A STATE WHO'S SEEN THE

20:45.633 --> 20:46.567
HEADLINES, "FLORIDA RESTAURANT

20:46.633 --> 20:48.200
NO LONGER ALLOWS

20:48.266 --> 20:51.066
'MONKEY MONDAYS' AFTER ANIMAL

20:51.133 --> 20:52.667
BIT 8-YEAR-OLD BOY", AND

20:52.734 --> 20:55.033
"FLORIDA BESTIALITY LAW DOES NOT

20:55.100 --> 20:57.433
BAN ORAL SEX WITH ANIMALS", AND

20:57.500 --> 20:59.433
"FLORIDA GAS STATION ROBBED,

20:59.500 --> 21:01.367
SUSPECT APPEARED TO HAVE

21:01.433 --> 21:04.767
DRAWN-ON BEARD," WHICH I'D SAY

21:04.834 --> 21:06.400
IS PROBABLY TRUE, GIVEN THAT

21:06.467 --> 21:08.967
THIS WAS THE BEARD.

21:09.033 --> 21:12.066
AND YES, YES, FLORIDIANS, YOU

21:12.133 --> 21:13.867
MAKE MISTAKES, BUT IT'S ALSO IN

21:13.934 --> 21:14.734
YOUR NATURE TO HELP ONE ANOTHER

21:14.800 --> 21:15.333
RECOVER, AS YOU CAN TELL FROM

21:15.400 --> 21:15.900
THE HEADLINE "GOOD SAMARITAN

21:15.967 --> 21:17.000
HELPS FLORIDA MAN WHO

21:17.066 --> 21:17.633
ACCIDENTALLY SHOT HIMSELF IN THE

21:17.700 --> 21:20.533
PENIS."

21:20.600 --> 21:21.667
YOU COME THROUGH FOR EACH OTHER!

21:21.734 --> 21:22.567
EVEN THIS SONG, YOUR STATE SONG,

21:22.633 --> 21:24.433
SPEAKS TO YOUR ABILITY TO SCREW

21:24.500 --> 21:26.433
UP AND BOUNCE BACK.

21:26.500 --> 21:27.767
THE ORIGINAL LYRICS TO THIS HAD

21:27.834 --> 21:29.033
TO BE CHANGED BECAUSE THEY WERE

21:29.100 --> 21:30.600
TOO RACIST.

21:30.667 --> 21:31.867
AND SOMEHOW, IT STILL SOUNDS

21:31.934 --> 21:36.300
RACIST TODAY, EVEN IN AN

21:36.367 --> 21:37.567
INSTRUMENTAL FORM.

21:37.633 --> 21:40.100
THE POINT IS, THIS NOVEMBER,

21:40.166 --> 21:41.600
FLORIDA, YOU'VE GOT A REAL

21:41.667 --> 21:42.967
CHANCE TO REMEDY A MISTAKE AND

21:43.033 --> 21:43.900
DO SOMETHING GOOD FOR OVER A

21:43.967 --> 21:46.533
MILLION OF YOUR CITIZENS.

21:46.600 --> 21:50.066
SO PLEASE, ON NOVEMBER 6TH,

21:50.133 --> 21:51.567
FOR ONE DAY, DON'T TAKE YOUR

21:51.633 --> 21:53.433
GOAT FOR A WALK IN YOUR

21:53.500 --> 21:56.400
UNDERWEAR, STAY AWAY FROM ANY

21:56.467 --> 21:57.367
BITEY OTTERS, DRAW ON A

21:57.433 --> 21:58.266
FAKE BEARD, AND GO

21:58.333 --> 21:59.100
CAST A VOTE ON BEHALF OF ALL

21:59.166 --> 22:00.166
YOUR FELLOW FLORIDIANS WHO ARE

22:00.233 --> 22:04.367
UNABLE TO.

22:04.433 --> 22:08.033
PLEASE DO IT.

22:08.100 --> 22:08.934
CHEERS, FLORIDA.

22:09.000 --> 22:09.166
CHEERS.

22:09.233 --> 22:12.700
AND NOW THIS.

22:12.767 --> 22:15.000
>> Announcer: AND NOW, IT'S

22:15.066 --> 22:16.567
THAT TIME OF YEAR AGAIN.

22:16.633 --> 22:19.967
>> IT IS THE UNOFFICIAL START OF

22:20.033 --> 22:22.000
FALL WITH THE RETURN OF THE

22:22.066 --> 22:23.734
PUMPKIN SPICE LATTE.

22:23.800 --> 22:28.567
>> HOLY FUCKING SHIT!

22:28.633 --> 22:29.166
>> PUMPKIN SPICE SEASON IS

22:29.233 --> 22:31.367
ALMOST UPON US.

22:31.433 --> 22:34.000
>> YOU KNOW HOW MUCH WE LOVE

22:34.066 --> 22:34.834
PUNK AND PILATES!

22:34.900 --> 22:37.900
>> WHY DO WE LOVE PUMPKIN SPICE

22:37.967 --> 22:40.333
PRODUCTS SO MUCH?

22:40.400 --> 22:44.367
>> FUCK YOU, DR. OZ!

22:44.433 --> 22:46.333
>> IS IT HOT OR COLD, I'M NOT A

22:46.400 --> 22:49.200
STARBUCKS FAN.

22:49.266 --> 22:51.567
>> YOU CAN GET IT HOWEVER YOU

22:51.633 --> 22:52.800
WANT.

22:52.867 --> 22:57.333
>> PUMPKIN SPICE LATTES!

22:57.400 --> 22:59.567
>> YOU HAVE TO BELIEVE THE

22:59.633 --> 23:00.133
SUMMER IS ALMOST OVER.

23:00.200 --> 23:01.533
>> I DON'T WANT TO THINK ABOUT

23:01.600 --> 23:03.867
THAT RIGHT NOW.

23:03.934 --> 23:06.834
>> YOU CAN'T DENY THE CRUEL AND

23:06.900 --> 23:10.567
INDIFFERENT TASK OF TIME!

23:10.633 --> 23:12.767
>> STARBUCKS IS GETTING READY

23:12.834 --> 23:13.600
FOR FALL WHEN YOU CAN ORDER THE

23:13.667 --> 23:15.900
PUMPKIN SPICE LATTE.

23:15.967 --> 23:18.100
>> THEY ARE GOING TO MAKE IT

23:18.166 --> 23:18.867
YEAR-ROUND AT SOME POINT.

23:18.934 --> 23:20.367
>> WAIT UNTIL THEY MAKE IT

23:20.433 --> 23:22.967
INTRAVENOUS.

23:23.033 --> 23:26.500
>> YEAH, PUT THE PUMPKIN SPICE

23:26.567 --> 23:30.100
LATTE INTO MY VEINS!

23:32.066 --> 23:36.333
>> John: FINALLY TONIGHT, I'D

23:36.400 --> 23:38.667
LIKE TO TALK FOR A MOMENT ABOUT

23:38.734 --> 23:38.900
SPACE,

23:38.967 --> 23:39.867
BASICALLY, A FEW POINTS OF

23:39.934 --> 23:40.533
INTEREST SEPARATED BY A

23:40.600 --> 23:41.333
TERRIFYING EXPANSE OF FROZEN

23:41.400 --> 23:42.033
NOTHINGNESS.

23:42.100 --> 23:43.200
THINK OF IT LIKE NORTH DAKOTA,

23:43.266 --> 23:44.600
BUT SIGNIFICANTLY BLACKER.

23:44.667 --> 23:45.800
LAST WEEK, THE INTERNATIONAL

23:45.867 --> 23:47.633
SPACE STATION HAD A BIT OF A

23:47.700 --> 23:49.033
SCARE.

23:49.100 --> 23:50.333
>> WE'RE LEARNING THAT THE

23:50.400 --> 23:51.433
INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION

23:51.500 --> 23:55.266
APPARENTLY HAS SPRUNG A LEAK.

23:55.333 --> 23:57.867
>> MISSION CONTROL NOTICED

23:57.934 --> 23:59.367
PRESSURE ON BOARD THE STATION

23:59.433 --> 23:59.867
STARTED DROPPING SLOWLY.

23:59.934 --> 24:00.834
THEY ALERTED ASTRONAUTS ON BOARD

24:00.900 --> 24:02.133
WHO FOUND A TINY HOLE THE SIZE

24:02.200 --> 24:03.033
OF A DIME.

24:03.100 --> 24:04.867
THE SOLUTION

24:04.934 --> 24:07.200
HIGH-TECH DUCT TAPE.

24:07.266 --> 24:07.800
>> John: "WHAT ELSE"?

24:07.867 --> 24:17.200
I DON'T KNOW, HOPEFULLY LOTS OF

24:17.266 --> 24:17.900
OTHER THINGS.

24:17.967 --> 24:18.567
YOUR FIRST ANSWER TO

24:18.633 --> 24:19.300
"WHAT SHOULD WE USE TO FIX THE

24:19.367 --> 24:19.967
HOLE IN THE SPACE STATION?"

24:20.033 --> 24:20.667
SHOULDN'T BE THE SAME STUFF I'D

24:20.734 --> 24:21.266
USE TO FIX A BROKEN LEG ON A

24:21.333 --> 24:22.033
CAT.

24:22.100 --> 24:23.233
ALTHOUGH, SEEING AS MY FIRST

24:23.300 --> 24:23.867
ANSWER TO "HOW SHOULD YOU FIX A

24:23.934 --> 24:24.467
CAT?" WAS THAT, I MIGHT NOT BE

24:24.533 --> 24:25.133
THE ONE YOU WANT TO TURN TO FOR

24:25.200 --> 24:27.667
ENGINEERING QUESTIONS.

24:27.734 --> 24:32.667
LOOK, THIS IS CLEARLY

24:32.734 --> 24:33.633
EXTREMELY FRIGHTENING.

24:33.700 --> 24:34.567
AND EXPERTS INITIALLY BELIEVED

24:34.633 --> 24:35.066
THE HOLE WAS CAUSED BY A

24:35.133 --> 24:35.567
MICRO-METEORITE STRIKE.

24:35.633 --> 24:36.266
BUT THIS WEEK, THE STORY TOOK A

24:36.333 --> 24:37.200
DRAMATIC TURN.

24:37.266 --> 24:38.533
>> THE HOLE FOUND IN THE

24:38.600 --> 24:39.400
INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION MAY

24:39.467 --> 24:41.500
HAVE BEEN AN INSIDE JOB.

24:41.567 --> 24:42.834
EXPERTS WARNING A HOMESICK

24:42.900 --> 24:44.000
ASTRONAUT COULD HAVE

24:44.066 --> 24:45.367
DELIBERATELY DRILLED A HOLE IN

24:45.433 --> 24:46.700
THE SATELLITE, FORCING EVERYONE

24:46.767 --> 24:51.767
TO RETURN TO EARTH EARLY.

24:51.834 --> 24:52.400
>> John: HOLY SHIT.

24:52.467 --> 24:53.333
WELL, IF YOU WERE

24:53.400 --> 24:54.533
WONDERING WHAT SITS AT THE

24:54.600 --> 24:55.233
CENTER OF THE VENN DIAGRAM OF

24:55.300 --> 24:56.633
WILD SPECULATION ON FOX NEWS AND

24:56.700 --> 24:57.734
TOPICS OF ELTON JOHN SONGS,

24:57.800 --> 24:58.700
WE'VE FOUND IT, AND IT'S

24:58.767 --> 25:03.834
"HOMESICK ASTRONAUT."

25:03.900 --> 25:05.233
BUT THE THING IS, THEY'RE

25:05.300 --> 25:05.800
ACTUALLY ONLY SLIGHTLY

25:05.867 --> 25:06.467
EXAGGERATING THERE,

25:06.533 --> 25:07.166
BECAUSE RUSSIA'S SPACE AGENCY

25:07.233 --> 25:07.934
DID ANNOUNCE THE HOLE APPEARED

25:08.000 --> 25:09.400
TO BE DRILLED BY WHAT THEY

25:09.467 --> 25:10.433
DESCRIBED AS A HUMAN HAND AND

25:10.500 --> 25:11.433
DIDN'T RULE OUT DELIBERATE

25:11.500 --> 25:13.834
INTERFERENCE IN SPACE.

25:13.900 --> 25:15.700
AND OBVIOUSLY, THAT'S AN

25:15.767 --> 25:16.834
EXPLOSIVE ALLEGATION, BECAUSE

25:16.900 --> 25:18.266
THE IMPLICATION IS THAT ONE OF

25:18.333 --> 25:19.400
THESE SIX ASTRONAUTS,

25:19.467 --> 25:20.400
PROFESSIONALS AT THE VERY TOP OF

25:20.467 --> 25:22.533
THEIR FIELD, MAY'VE DRILLED THE

25:22.600 --> 25:26.367
HOLE ON PURPOSE.

25:26.433 --> 25:27.600
THAT IS A SPACE CRIME.

25:27.667 --> 25:28.967
AND THAT KIND OF SPECULATION

25:29.033 --> 25:31.100
ISN'T JUST IRRESPONSIBLE,

25:31.166 --> 25:36.467
IT'S CLEARLY INCREDIBLY FUN,

25:36.533 --> 25:41.600
BECAUSE THE SITUATION RIGHT NOW

25:41.667 --> 25:42.667
IS THAT WE HAVE

25:42.734 --> 25:43.367
A SPACE WHODUNNIT ON

25:43.433 --> 25:44.066
OUR HANDS.

25:44.133 --> 25:44.800
SO LET ME INTRODUCE YOU TO

25:44.867 --> 25:45.500
"LAST WEEK TONIGHT: SVU."

25:45.567 --> 25:46.467
"SPACESHIP VENTILATION --

25:46.533 --> 25:48.033
COMMA -- UNEXPECTED."

25:48.100 --> 25:52.367
COME WITH ME.

25:52.433 --> 25:53.900
COME WITH ME RIGHT NOW PLEASE.

25:53.967 --> 25:55.700
BECAUSE WE ARE GOING TO GET TO

25:55.767 --> 25:57.033
THE BOTTOM OF WHO'S RESPONSIBLE

25:57.100 --> 25:57.967
FOR THIS SPACE HOLE.

25:58.033 --> 25:58.700
SO WHICH ONE OF THESE ASTRONAUTS

25:58.767 --> 25:59.233
COULD IT BE?

25:59.300 --> 26:00.100
WAS IT DREW FEUSTEL, MISSION

26:00.166 --> 26:00.967
COMMANDER?

26:01.033 --> 26:02.567
WAS IT ALEXANDER GERST?

26:02.633 --> 26:04.033
HIS HOBBIES APPARENTLY INCLUDE

26:04.100 --> 26:05.100
SKYDIVING.

26:05.166 --> 26:06.367
WAS HE LOOKING FOR

26:06.433 --> 26:07.133
THE ULTIMATE FALL?

26:07.200 --> 26:08.567
WAS IT SERGEY PROKOPYEV?

26:08.633 --> 26:10.033
HIS BIO ON THE ISS WEBSITE IS

26:10.100 --> 26:10.667
ALL IN RUSSIAN, SO I DON'T KNOW

26:10.734 --> 26:17.633
ANYTHING ABOUT HIM.

26:17.700 --> 26:18.300
THAT IS IMMEDIATELY SUSPICIOUS

26:18.367 --> 26:18.900
TO ME.

26:18.967 --> 26:19.667
OR COULD IT BE HIS FELLOW

26:19.734 --> 26:23.467
COSMONAUT, OLEG ARTEMYEV?

26:23.533 --> 26:23.967
DID HE SNAP AFTER BEING

26:24.033 --> 26:25.133
CONSTANTLY TEASED

26:25.200 --> 26:25.600
FOR HIS OBSESSION WITH

26:25.667 --> 26:26.400
HORIZONTALLY STRIPED SHIRTS?

26:26.467 --> 26:27.033
THROW A VERTICAL SHIRT IN THERE,

26:27.100 --> 26:27.600
OLEG.

26:27.667 --> 26:29.333
YOU LOOK LIKE A SPACE MIME.

26:29.400 --> 26:30.333
WAS IT FORMER FLIGHT SURGEON

26:30.400 --> 26:31.834
SERENA AUNON

26:31.900 --> 26:33.066
OR WAS IT OUR FINAL SUSPECT,

26:33.133 --> 26:35.333
RICKY ARNOLD?

26:35.400 --> 26:44.100
NOW, I'M NOT SAYING HE'S GUILTY.

26:44.166 --> 26:45.633
WHAT I AM SAYING IS, IF YOU

26:45.700 --> 26:46.800
TRUST A GROWN MAN NAMED RICKY,

26:46.867 --> 26:47.300
YOU'RE A FUCKING IDIOT.

26:47.367 --> 26:48.033
SO THESE ARE ALL OUR OPTIONS.

26:48.100 --> 26:48.867
OR ARE THEY?

26:48.934 --> 26:50.133
BECAUSE IT TURNS OUT THERE ARE

26:50.200 --> 26:50.767
MORE THAN JUST PEOPLE ON BOARD.

26:50.834 --> 26:51.667
>> ALSO ON BOARD THE CAPSULE ARE

26:51.734 --> 26:55.200
GENETICALLY IDENTICAL BROWN MICE

26:55.266 --> 26:56.133
FOR A STUDY OF THEIR

26:56.200 --> 26:59.367
GUT BACTERIA.

26:59.433 --> 27:00.200
>> John: IT'S TRUE.

27:00.266 --> 27:01.533
IT TURNS OUT THERE ARE ALSO 20

27:01.600 --> 27:04.200
MICE ON THE SPACE STATION.

27:04.266 --> 27:06.400
OR RATHER, THERE WERE 20,

27:06.467 --> 27:07.867
BECAUSE APPARENTLY TEN OF THEM

27:07.934 --> 27:09.333
HAVE ALREADY BEEN DISSECTED IN

27:09.400 --> 27:10.700
AN EXPERIMENT, GIVING THE

27:10.767 --> 27:12.066
REMAINING MICE THE PERFECT

27:12.133 --> 27:17.166
MOTIVE TO ENGAGE IN SPACE

27:17.233 --> 27:17.967
SO -- AND THIS IS TRUE --

27:18.033 --> 27:18.700
WE ACTUALLY CONTACTED NASA

27:18.767 --> 27:19.333
AND ASKED IF THEY COULD PROVIDE

27:19.400 --> 27:20.100
US WITH PHOTOS AND NAMES OF THE

27:20.166 --> 27:21.066
MICE.

27:21.133 --> 27:21.767
THEY TOLD US -- AND I QUOTE --

27:21.834 --> 27:22.834
"WE DO NOT NAME THE MICE AND

27:22.900 --> 27:26.967
DON'T HAVE PHOTOS OF THEM."

27:27.033 --> 27:29.166
SOUNDS LIKE A DODGE TO ME, SO WE

27:29.233 --> 27:33.800
MADE OUR OWN.

27:33.867 --> 27:34.300
WHAT I'M ASKING YOU IS,

27:34.367 --> 27:35.033
WHO WAS IT?

27:35.100 --> 27:35.800
WAS IT FUZZ ALDRIN?

27:35.867 --> 27:36.800
NEIL TAILSTRONG?

27:36.867 --> 27:37.834
RODENT POLANSKI?

27:37.900 --> 27:38.333
MICE DALLAS HOWARD?

27:38.400 --> 27:39.266
MAUS VON BULOW?

27:39.333 --> 27:40.500
CHAIRMAN MOUSE?

27:40.567 --> 27:41.300
ISABELLA ROSSA

27:41.367 --> 27:42.333
JOHN LEGUIZAMOUSE?

27:42.400 --> 27:44.266
FOREST WHISKER?

27:44.333 --> 27:45.400
OR WAS IT DAVE?

27:45.467 --> 27:46.734
WHO CAN SAY?

27:46.800 --> 27:47.600
WHO CAN SAY?

27:47.667 --> 27:48.667
WE TRIED GETTING MORE

27:48.734 --> 27:50.700
INFORMATION OUT OF NASA.

27:50.767 --> 27:52.100
WE ACTUALLY ASKED THEM IF ANY OF

27:52.166 --> 27:53.667
THE MICE WERE GOING THROUGH ANY

27:53.734 --> 27:54.500
SORT OF PERSONAL TRAUMA, LIKE A

27:54.567 --> 27:58.767
BANKRUPTCY OR DIVORCE.

27:58.834 --> 27:59.400
THEY TOLD US -- AND AGAIN

27:59.467 --> 28:00.133
I QUOTE --

28:00.200 --> 28:01.066
"AN ATTENDING VETERINARIAN

28:01.133 --> 28:02.367
MONITORS THE MICE THROUGH ALL

28:02.433 --> 28:03.734
PHASES OF FLIGHT."

28:03.800 --> 28:05.734
WHICH IS NOT WHAT WE ASKED THEM.

28:05.800 --> 28:06.800
IS IT?

28:06.867 --> 28:12.233
AT THIS POINT, WE WERE

28:12.300 --> 28:13.266
UNDERSTANDABLY SUSPICIOUS, SO WE

28:13.333 --> 28:13.900
ASKED THEM,

28:13.967 --> 28:14.633
"ARE YOU A HUMAN, OR ARE YOU A

28:14.700 --> 28:15.433
MOUSE WORKING WITH THE

28:15.500 --> 28:16.066
SPACE MICE FROM THE INSIDE?"

28:16.133 --> 28:23.900
TO WHICH NASA REPLIED --

28:23.967 --> 28:25.734
AND AGAIN I SWEAR THIS IS TRUE

28:25.800 --> 28:26.600
-- "I AM, IN FACT, A HUMAN."

28:26.667 --> 28:27.200
WHICH IS EXACTLY WHAT A MOUSE

28:27.266 --> 28:27.667
WOULD SAY.

28:27.734 --> 28:28.300
WE'RE CLEARLY ON TO SOMETHING

28:28.367 --> 28:28.967
HERE, AND I'M INVITING ALL OF

28:29.033 --> 28:29.600
YOU TO HELP SOLVE WHICH OF THESE

28:29.667 --> 28:30.300
MICE IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE

28:30.367 --> 28:31.033
SPACE HOLE.

28:31.100 --> 28:31.934
IN FACT, WE'LL BE DEVOTING THE

28:32.000 --> 28:32.934
ENTIRE 30 MINUTES OF NEXT WEEK'S

28:33.000 --> 28:34.734
SHOW TO THIS STORY.

28:34.800 --> 28:36.467
AND KNOW THIS, IF I AM NOT HERE

28:36.533 --> 28:38.066
NEXT SUNDAY NIGHT, THE ONLY

28:38.133 --> 28:39.266
REASON IS BECAUSE THE MICE GOT

28:39.333 --> 28:42.567
TO ME.

28:42.633 --> 28:44.467
THAT IS OUR SHOW.

28:44.533 --> 28:45.800
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR WATCHING.

28:45.867 --> 28:48.934
GOOD NIGHT!

28:49.000 --> 28:50.266
FIND THE MICE.

28:50.333 --> 28:54.667
FIND THE MICE.
