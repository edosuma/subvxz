00:02.436 --> 00:03.371
PREVIOUSLY ON
<i>THE PRACTICE...</i>

00:03.438 --> 00:05.207
THIS LAW FIRM
DOESN'T ADVERTISE.

00:05.273 --> 00:06.842
LOTS OF LAWYERS
DO COMMERCIALS.

00:06.909 --> 00:08.044
YEAH, THE SHYSTERS.

00:08.111 --> 00:09.112
I WANT TO CONTRIBUTE HERE.

00:09.178 --> 00:10.314
I WANT TO BRING IN
BUSINESS.

00:10.380 --> 00:11.949
AT LEAST
GIVE ME THE CHANCE.

00:12.016 --> 00:13.184
THINK NOBODY'LL
FIGHT FOR YOU?

00:13.251 --> 00:14.452
YOU'RE JUST A GRUNT?

00:14.520 --> 00:15.687
I'M A GRUNT.

00:15.754 --> 00:17.023
JUST DIAL THE NUMBER:

00:17.089 --> 00:19.526
555-GRNT...

00:19.592 --> 00:21.061
AND ASK FOR JIMMY.

00:21.128 --> 00:22.430
I'LL GET YOUR MONEY.

00:22.496 --> 00:24.867
DOING A COMMERCIAL,
IT EMBARRASSES THIS PLACE.

00:24.934 --> 00:26.168
THERE'S LITTLE PEOPLE
OUT THERE--

00:26.235 --> 00:28.371
HACKS WITH SMALL-CLAIMS
THE SIZE OF A BLACKHEAD

00:28.438 --> 00:30.775
YOU'D GO RUNNING
TO YOUR DERMATOLOGIST
TO HAVE REMOVED.

00:30.842 --> 00:33.511
I'M HAPPY FOR YOU
THAT YOU DON'T FIT
INTO THAT CATEGORY.

00:33.578 --> 00:37.050
I DO, AND I'M SELLING
WHAT I GOT TO SELL.

00:37.116 --> 00:38.084
JIMMY...

00:38.151 --> 00:39.386
I'M SORRY.

00:39.453 --> 00:40.755
BOBBY SAYS
I GOT THIS COMPLEX

00:40.821 --> 00:42.991
THAT I WANT TO BE
THE LAW FIRM
ACROSS THE STREET.

00:43.058 --> 00:46.496
I REALLY AM SORRY
FOR SAYING WHAT I SAID.

00:50.201 --> 00:52.170
OK, EVERYBODY,
LISTEN UP.

00:53.238 --> 00:57.644
EXCUSE ME.
WHAT WE DO IS A LOTTERY.

00:57.711 --> 01:00.682
NOW, ONLY 6 OF YOU WILL
ACTUALLY GET IN TO SEE

01:00.748 --> 01:02.450
JIMMY THE GRUNT.

01:02.517 --> 01:04.553
THE REST OF YOU--
EXCUSE ME.

01:04.620 --> 01:08.726
I'M SORRY--WILL EITHER HAVE
TO SEE OTHER LAWYERS

01:08.793 --> 01:11.997
OR COME BACK TOMORROW
AND RE-ENTER THE...

01:12.063 --> 01:14.066

01:14.133 --> 01:17.170

OR--OR YOU CAN, UH...

01:17.237 --> 01:18.772
WAIT FOR OUR CALL.

01:18.839 --> 01:21.676
YOU HAVE INFORMATIONAL
SHEETS TO FILL OUT.

01:21.743 --> 01:26.817
UM, PLEASE INDICATE
THE NATURE OF YOUR PROBLEM,

01:26.883 --> 01:28.352
UM, ON LINE NUMBER 3.

01:28.419 --> 01:31.790
VERY IMPORTANT,
LINE NUMBER 4....

01:31.857 --> 01:34.694
I'M SORRY, MA'AM.
MY DAUGHTER HAS
TOURETTE'S SYNDROME.

01:34.761 --> 01:36.196
THAT'S WHY WE'RE HERE.

01:36.263 --> 01:38.633
SHE GOT EXPELLED
FROM HER SCHOOL.

01:38.699 --> 01:39.868
WE NEED A LAWYER.

01:39.935 --> 01:41.770
WELL, UH...

01:41.837 --> 01:43.906
I THINK WE'LL EXEMPT YOU
FROM THE LOTTERY.

01:43.973 --> 01:45.308
COME ON IN.

01:48.279 --> 01:49.881
UH, EXCUSE ME.

01:49.948 --> 01:51.416
HI.

01:51.483 --> 01:53.086
WHAT IF YOU'RE NOT HERE
TO SEE JIMMY THE GRUNT?

01:53.153 --> 01:54.855
DO YOU STILL HAVE TO GO
THROUGH THE LOTTERY?

01:54.921 --> 01:55.756
WELL, WHO ARE YOU
HERE TO SEE?

01:55.822 --> 01:56.858
BOBBY DONNELL.

01:56.924 --> 01:58.059
OH, WELL,
HE STEPPED OUT--

01:58.125 --> 01:59.161
SHARON?

02:00.496 --> 02:01.630
HI.

02:02.799 --> 02:05.035
WOW.

02:05.102 --> 02:06.003
IT'S BEEN
A LONG TIME.

02:06.070 --> 02:07.505
YEAH.

02:07.572 --> 02:09.306
ANOTHER
EX-GIRLFRIEND?

02:09.375 --> 02:11.343
SH-SHE WAS
MY SENIOR PROM DATE.

02:12.879 --> 02:14.915
WHAT--WELL, HI.

02:14.982 --> 02:16.284
HI.

02:20.155 --> 02:22.092
WELL, YOU LOOK...

02:22.158 --> 02:23.560
SO DO YOU.
SO DO YOU.

02:23.627 --> 02:25.262
COME ON IN.

02:26.998 --> 02:29.968
ANYBODY ELSE HERE USED
TO DATE ATTORNEY DONNELL?

03:19.469 --> 03:20.837
THEY SAID HER OUTBURSTS
WERE TOO DISRUPTIVE.

03:20.904 --> 03:21.772
THE TEACHERS?

03:21.838 --> 03:23.340
YEAH.

03:23.407 --> 03:24.776
SEE, THESE ARE TICS.

03:24.842 --> 03:26.645
WHAT HAPPENS IS
SHE TRIES TO CONTROL THEM

03:26.712 --> 03:27.746
BECAUSE SHE DOESN'T WANT
TO DISTRACT THE CLASS,

03:27.813 --> 03:29.716
BUT THE MORE
SHE HOLDS THEM IN,

03:29.783 --> 03:32.620
THE BIGGER THE OUTBURSTS
WHEN THEY HAPPEN.

03:33.721 --> 03:35.557
ELLENOR...

03:35.624 --> 03:37.359
THIS LITTLE GIRL
WAS TOSSED OUT OF SCHOOL

03:37.426 --> 03:38.961
BECAUSE OF
A DISABILITY--

03:39.028 --> 03:39.963
TOURETTE'S SYNDROME.

03:40.030 --> 03:43.868
ELLENOR FRUTT, THIS IS
LISA AND WILLIAM WRIGHT.

03:43.935 --> 03:44.969
NICE TO MEET YOU.

03:45.037 --> 03:46.438
HI, IT'S, UH, LISA?

03:46.506 --> 03:48.108
YEAH.
NICE TO MEET YOU.

03:48.174 --> 03:50.211
HI.

03:50.277 --> 03:51.779
BEEN READING ABOUT YOU
IN THE PAPERS...

03:53.348 --> 03:54.950
SEEING YOUR FACE
ON THE NEWS.

03:55.017 --> 03:56.585
YOU'VE BEEN BUSY.

03:56.652 --> 03:59.055
WELL, SO HAVE YOU, HUH?

03:59.123 --> 04:00.057
2 KIDS.

04:01.426 --> 04:02.928
I HAVE PICTURES.

04:06.232 --> 04:08.201
RIGHT. HERE IS, UH...

04:08.268 --> 04:09.903
MELISSA.

04:09.970 --> 04:12.240
SHE'S 13 GOING ON 20,

04:12.306 --> 04:14.844
AND THAT'S JUSTIN.
HE JUST TURNED 5.

04:14.910 --> 04:17.180
AH, THEY'RE GREAT.

04:17.247 --> 04:18.982
WHAT ABOUT, UH,
YOUR HUSBAND?

04:19.048 --> 04:20.685
OH, LONG GONE.

04:23.221 --> 04:24.390
UH, I MARRIED YOUNG.

04:24.457 --> 04:26.259
HE WAS IN LAW SCHOOL,

04:26.325 --> 04:28.262
FULL OF IDEALISM.

04:28.328 --> 04:29.363
I WAS SWEPT AWAY.

04:29.429 --> 04:30.398
WHAT HAPPENED?

04:30.465 --> 04:31.967
HE BECAME A LAWYER.

04:38.942 --> 04:40.011
SO...

04:40.078 --> 04:41.613
YEAH...

04:41.680 --> 04:42.581
SO...

04:43.849 --> 04:46.386
UH, THIS IS
THE HARD PART.

04:46.452 --> 04:47.754
UM...

04:48.689 --> 04:50.725
I'M--I'M
IN SOME TROUBLE.

04:51.493 --> 04:52.661
WHAT KIND OF TROUBLE?

04:54.230 --> 04:55.632
I'VE BEEN ARRESTED.

04:56.766 --> 04:57.868
WHAT?

04:57.935 --> 04:59.670
UH, BOBBY...

04:59.737 --> 05:02.608
MY ARCHITECTURAL CAREER
DIDN'T EXACTLY, UM...

05:03.509 --> 05:05.512
TAKE OFF...

05:05.578 --> 05:08.783
SO I STARTED
SUPPLEMENTING
MY INCOME...

05:12.588 --> 05:15.626
UH, AS A CALL GIRL.

05:16.860 --> 05:17.795
OH.

05:20.132 --> 05:21.767
WELL, YOU KNOW, IT...

05:26.206 --> 05:27.207
WHAT?

05:27.274 --> 05:28.643
YEAH.

05:30.712 --> 05:33.983
AND IF YOU'RE NOT
THE LAST PERSON ON EARTH

05:34.051 --> 05:35.553
I WOULD WANT TO FIND OUT
ABOUT THIS,

05:35.619 --> 05:37.255
YOU'RE CERTAINLY
ON THE SHORT LIST.

05:37.321 --> 05:38.723
UM...

05:38.790 --> 05:42.127
THE 2 PEOPLE
THAT <i>WOULD</i> BE LAST

05:42.195 --> 05:44.197
ARE IN THIS PICTURE.

05:46.601 --> 05:48.636
I CANNOT HAVE THEM
FIND OUT.

05:53.310 --> 05:56.714
UH, AS FAR AS I'VE READ,
YOU SEEM LIKE
A GOOD LAWYER,

05:56.781 --> 05:59.184
AND, UH, I NEED SOMEONE
I CAN TRUST.

06:06.027 --> 06:07.195
TAKE IT EASY.

06:07.261 --> 06:09.398
I WON'T TAKE IT EASY!
IT KEEPS EATING
MY EXHIBITS.

06:09.464 --> 06:10.700
YOU HIT IT.

06:10.766 --> 06:12.135
IF I HIT IT,
IT'LL BE DEAD.

06:12.202 --> 06:13.504
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

06:13.570 --> 06:14.605
THE MATTER IS
I'M IN TRIAL AT 2:00.

06:14.671 --> 06:15.607
THIS DAMN MACHINE
IS BROKEN AGAIN.

06:15.673 --> 06:16.608
I MEAN, WHY CAN'T
WE GET A NEW ONE?

06:16.674 --> 06:18.143
WE BEAT THE STUPID
TOBACCO COMPANY.

06:18.210 --> 06:18.977
WE HAVE THE MONEY.

06:19.044 --> 06:20.346
WHY CAN'T WE GET
A NEW MACHINE?

06:20.413 --> 06:21.347
I MEAN, IS THIS
A BOSTON THING?

06:21.414 --> 06:22.449
DOES EVERYTHING
HAVE TO BE

06:22.516 --> 06:23.918
A RELIC
PAUL REVERE USED?

06:23.984 --> 06:25.586
TRIALS MAKE YOU NERVOUS,
DON'T THEY?

06:26.521 --> 06:27.756
WHAT'S THAT?

06:27.823 --> 06:29.158
OH...

06:29.225 --> 06:30.960
THE COMMERCIALS ARE
GOING GOOD, YOU KNOW,

06:31.027 --> 06:33.230
SO THE MARKETING PEOPLE
CAME UP WITH THIS.

06:33.297 --> 06:35.033
IT'S JUST A PROTOTYPE.

06:36.735 --> 06:39.004
ARE YOU A GRUNT?
I'M A GRUNT.

06:39.071 --> 06:40.373
CALL ME.

06:40.440 --> 06:41.875
I'M NOT SURE
IT'S CLASSY.

06:47.583 --> 06:49.018
Ellenor: IT'S A BLATANT
DISCRIMINATION.

06:49.085 --> 06:50.954
I WOULD AT LEAST THINK
THEY WOULD TRY
TO DISGUISE IT.

06:51.020 --> 06:52.590
YOUR HONOR, THE SCHOOL
FEELS TERRIBLE.

06:52.657 --> 06:53.991
THEY DON'T WANT
TO EXPEL HER,

06:54.059 --> 06:55.561
BUT THERE ARE
A LOT OF STUDENTS
WHOSE INTERESTS--

06:55.627 --> 06:57.964
I HAVE SEEN NO SUGGESTION
THAT THE INTERESTS
OF THE STUDENTS

06:58.030 --> 06:59.399
HAVE BEEN
COMPROMISED BY THE--

06:59.466 --> 07:01.268
SHE YELLS OUT
DURING CLASS.

07:01.334 --> 07:03.204
SHE JUMPS UP AND DOWN.

07:03.271 --> 07:05.173
[LISA YELPS]

07:11.148 --> 07:13.651
I SUSPECT THAT DESPITE
LISA'S OUTBURST RIGHT HERE,

07:13.718 --> 07:16.322
THE COURT WILL CARRY OUT
AND CONCLUDE ITS BUSINESS.

07:16.389 --> 07:17.623
I ALSO SUSPECT
THAT THE TEACHERS

07:17.690 --> 07:20.494
COULD CARRY OUT AND
COMPLETE THEIR BUSINESS
IN THE CLASSROOM.

07:20.560 --> 07:21.962
THIS IS AN INTELLIGENT
YOUNG GIRL.

07:22.029 --> 07:23.331
IS THIS THE WAY
WE'RE GOING
TO DEAL WITH HER?

07:23.398 --> 07:25.267
Judge: I WANT TO CONDUCT
AN EVIDENTIARY HEARING,

07:25.334 --> 07:27.403
AND I WANT TO HEAR
FROM THE SCHOOL PRINCIPAL.

07:27.470 --> 07:29.039
I WOULD THEN LIKE
TO TALK TO LISA.

07:29.106 --> 07:32.811
WE COULD START
THIS AFTERNOON.

07:35.214 --> 07:36.682
3:00.

07:36.749 --> 07:38.819
[JUDGE BANGS GAVEL]

07:41.088 --> 07:42.156
OK, THANKS.

07:45.228 --> 07:48.097
THEY'RE WILLING TO DEAL,
BUT OPEN-ENDED.

07:48.164 --> 07:49.633
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

07:49.700 --> 07:53.639
IT MEANS IF YOU GIVE THEM
ENOUGH TO HELP CRACK
THE PROSTITUTION RING,

07:53.705 --> 07:55.307
YOU'LL BE OFF
WITH NO FINDING--

07:55.374 --> 07:56.843
MORE IMPORTANT,
NO RECORD.

07:56.909 --> 07:58.746
BUT FROM WHAT
YOU'VE TOLD ME,

07:58.812 --> 08:00.614
I--I'M NOT SURE YOU GOT
ENOUGH TO GIVE THEM.

08:00.681 --> 08:02.116
I TOLD YOU
EVERYTHING I KNOW.

08:02.183 --> 08:04.086
NO, I UNDERSTAND,
BUT IT MAY NOT BE ENOUGH

08:04.153 --> 08:07.257
TO--TO SECURE CONVICTIONS
AGAINST THE ESCORT SERVICE.

08:08.725 --> 08:09.626
SO WHAT DO WE DO?

08:09.694 --> 08:11.329
WELL, WE MIGHT
AS WELL TRY.

08:11.396 --> 08:12.665
WE GOT
NOTHING TO LOSE.

08:12.731 --> 08:14.733
SETTLEMENT NEGOTIATIONS
ARE INADMISSIBLE,

08:14.800 --> 08:16.603
SO IF WE DON'T LIKE
WHAT WE GET,

08:16.670 --> 08:17.972
WE CAN STILL
GO TO TRIAL.

08:18.038 --> 08:19.006
OK.

08:23.245 --> 08:24.146
LOOK, IT--

08:25.482 --> 08:26.950
THIS MIGHT NOT...

08:27.885 --> 08:29.553
BE MY--
MY BUSINESS, BUT--

08:29.620 --> 08:31.022
I HAD NO MONEY.

08:32.758 --> 08:36.196
I WAS FACING EVICTION,
SO I DID IT ONE TIME.

08:36.261 --> 08:37.764
JUST ONCE...

08:39.601 --> 08:42.304
THEN TWICE--
JUST 2 TIMES--

08:44.574 --> 08:47.778
AND NOW EVERY TIME
IS MY LAST TIME.

08:52.084 --> 08:55.756
AND I'VE BEEN
SAYING THAT FOR 3 YEARS.

08:55.823 --> 08:58.192
WELL, SHARON, I MEAN...

08:59.428 --> 09:00.395
THERE'S OTHER WAYS.

09:00.462 --> 09:03.099
NOT FOR THAT KIND
OF MONEY.

09:03.166 --> 09:04.668
I KEPT THE CONDO
AFTER THE DIVORCE.

09:04.735 --> 09:06.237
THE MORTGAGE PAYMENT...

09:11.176 --> 09:12.846
MY KIDS...

09:12.912 --> 09:15.649
PRETTY MUCH
LOST THEIR FATHER,
AND I--

09:15.716 --> 09:17.752
I DIDN'T WANT THEM
TO LOSE THEIR HOME.

09:21.658 --> 09:24.828
BOBBY, I DON'T NEED
TO BE TOLD
HOW STUPID I WAS.

09:25.829 --> 09:27.298
ALL RIGHT, LOOK.

09:28.733 --> 09:31.471
LET'S--LET'S TALK
TO THE DETECTIVE.

09:31.537 --> 09:32.873
OK.

09:34.942 --> 09:37.279
I REMEMBER THEM SAYING
THEY HAD TO OPERATE,

09:37.345 --> 09:38.146
THEN THEY PUT ME OUT.

09:38.213 --> 09:39.948
AND YOU CONSENTED
TO THE OPERATION ITSELF?

09:40.015 --> 09:42.686
BUT I NEVER AGREED
TO THE MAGGOTS.

09:42.752 --> 09:44.221
WHEN DID YOU FIRST
REALIZE, MRS. BLAKE,

09:44.288 --> 09:47.859
THAT THE DOCTOR HAD SEWN
MAGGOTS INTO YOUR LEG?

09:47.926 --> 09:49.361
WHEN I CAME OUT
OF SURGERY,

09:49.428 --> 09:51.999
HE SAID IT WOULD HELP
HEAL THE WOUND. HA.

09:52.065 --> 09:53.667
I BEG YOUR PARDON?

09:53.734 --> 09:55.403
HA.

09:55.469 --> 09:56.738
OBJECTION.

09:56.805 --> 09:58.407
JURY WILL
DISREGARD "HA."

09:58.473 --> 10:01.745
I HAVE A--A PHOBIA
WHEN IT COMES TO...

10:01.812 --> 10:03.447
WORMS AND SNAKES

10:03.514 --> 10:04.949
AND SO FORTH.

10:05.016 --> 10:08.220
I HAVE HAD
ONGOING NIGHTMARES,

10:08.286 --> 10:09.622
INSOMNIA...

10:09.688 --> 10:11.358
WEIGHT LOSS, ANXIETY...

10:12.492 --> 10:14.429
EVEN DELUSIONS
SOMETIMES.

10:14.495 --> 10:15.797
WHAT KIND OF DELUSIONS?

10:15.864 --> 10:18.067
DELUSIONS
THAT THEY ARE...

10:19.702 --> 10:22.005
STILL IN ME, THESE...

10:22.072 --> 10:24.575
FAT ALBINO WORMS...

10:24.643 --> 10:25.910
INSIDE MY SKIN,

10:25.977 --> 10:28.581
CHEWING MY DEAD TISSUE,

10:28.648 --> 10:30.350
SQUIRMING AROUND,

10:30.416 --> 10:32.887
EXCRETING THEIR LARVAE
INTO MY VEINS,

10:32.954 --> 10:36.324
SPEWING THEIR PUTRID
LITTLE BACTERIAL GERMS

10:36.391 --> 10:37.593
INTO MY BLOODSTREAM.

10:37.660 --> 10:39.262
M-MAGGOTS--

10:39.328 --> 10:40.630
BIG, FAT...

10:40.697 --> 10:41.899
VICIOUS...

10:41.966 --> 10:43.468
MAGGOTS. I--

10:43.534 --> 10:47.039
I HAVE DELUSIONS
THAT MY ENTIRE PERSON

10:47.106 --> 10:49.076
IS BEING INFECTED
AND INVADED

10:49.142 --> 10:52.213
BY BIG, FAT
WHITE CHEWING
VICIOUS MAGGOTS.

10:54.182 --> 10:55.818
HOW'S YOUR LEG TODAY,
MA'AM?

10:55.885 --> 10:57.152
THIS ISN'T ABOUT MY LEG.

10:57.219 --> 10:59.790
YES, MA'AM,
BUT MY QUESTION IS,

10:59.856 --> 11:00.791
HOW'S YOUR LEG?

11:00.857 --> 11:01.826
IT'S FINE.

11:01.893 --> 11:03.695
FULLY RECOVERED?
YES.

11:03.761 --> 11:05.163
SUFFER ANY INFECTION?

11:05.230 --> 11:06.199
NO.

11:06.265 --> 11:08.001
DID YOU CONSULT WITH
OTHER DOCTORS OR SURGEONS

11:08.067 --> 11:09.336
AFTER YOUR OPERATION,
MRS. BLAKE?

11:09.403 --> 11:10.838
YES.

11:10.905 --> 11:13.775
ANY OF THEM SAY YOU WERE
LUCKY TO KEEP YOUR LEG
AFTER THE CAR ACCIDENT?

11:13.842 --> 11:15.978
I'M NOT CRITICIZING
HIS SURGICAL SKILLS,

11:16.045 --> 11:17.780
SO LET'S NOT TWIST IT.

11:17.847 --> 11:19.282
YOU'RE SUING HIM, MA'AM.

11:19.349 --> 11:21.685
HE SAVED YOUR LEG,
AND YOU'RE SUING HIM.

11:21.753 --> 11:23.322
THAT'S THE TWIST.

11:23.388 --> 11:25.525
HAVE YOU SOUGHT
PSYCHIATRIC HELP
AFTER THIS INCIDENT?

11:25.591 --> 11:26.826
YES, I HAVE.

11:26.893 --> 11:27.894
IN FACT--

11:27.961 --> 11:29.463
OBJECTION.

11:29.530 --> 11:30.564
OBJECTION, OBJECTION.

11:30.632 --> 11:31.966
HOLD ON.

11:32.033 --> 11:34.269
SIDE BAR?
YES. SPEED IT UP.

11:38.308 --> 11:40.110
I'M ATTEMPTING
TO SHOW

11:40.177 --> 11:41.679
SHE WAS GETTING
PSYCHIATRIC HELP
BEFORE THIS--

11:41.747 --> 11:44.216
EGGSHELL DOCTRINE
DOESN'T MATTER.
YOU TAKE YOUR PLAINTIFF--

11:44.283 --> 11:46.453
I'M CERTAINLY ENTITLED
TO PURSUE THIS LINE
OF QUESTIONING.

11:46.519 --> 11:47.520
IT'S IRRELEVANT.

11:47.587 --> 11:48.456
NO, IT ISN'T, COUNSEL.

11:48.522 --> 11:49.891
YOU CAN REDIRECT
AND REHABILITATE,

11:49.958 --> 11:51.360
BUT HE CAN ASK.
STEP BACK.

11:51.426 --> 11:53.395
JUST ONE SECOND.
I DON'T WANT
THE JURY TO THINK

11:53.462 --> 11:55.465
I WALKED UP HERE JUST
TO GET QUICKLY REBUFFED.

11:55.531 --> 11:57.401
IT'LL MAKE ME LOOK WEAK,
SO I'M GOING TO STAY
RIGHT HERE

11:57.468 --> 11:58.602
POINTING MY FINGER AT YOU
FOR A SECOND.

11:58.669 --> 12:01.039
[MURMURS]

12:02.908 --> 12:04.143
BECAUSE IF I'M UP HERE
LOSING THIS POINT,

12:04.210 --> 12:06.313
I'M AT LEAST GOING TO LOOK
AUTHORITATIVE IN DOING SO.

12:06.380 --> 12:08.082
THANK YOU.
I'M FINISHED.

12:08.148 --> 12:09.684
NOW I'LL STEP BACK.

12:18.762 --> 12:20.665
DOES SHE HAVE
TO BE THERE?

12:20.732 --> 12:22.367
WELL--
IT'S A STRESSFUL ROOM.

12:22.434 --> 12:24.470
SHE'S GOING
TO TIC WORSE, AND
IF THE JUDGE SEES THAT,

12:24.537 --> 12:26.172
YOU KNOW...

12:26.240 --> 12:28.342
I'D ABSOLUTELY WANT <i>YOU</i>
THERE, MR. WRIGHT.

12:28.409 --> 12:29.244
OH, OK.

12:29.311 --> 12:31.246
UM, CAN SHE WAIT HERE?

12:31.313 --> 12:32.748
OH, SHE CAN STAY
WITH ME.

12:32.815 --> 12:33.817
REALLY?

12:33.883 --> 12:35.419
NO PROBLEM.

12:35.485 --> 12:38.022
SHE'S NOT GOING TO BREAK
ANY DECORUM IN HERE.

12:38.089 --> 12:39.357
TRUST ME.

12:39.424 --> 12:40.492
THANKS.

12:43.195 --> 12:46.834
Sharon: I WOULD GET $600
FROM THE ESCORT SERVICE,

12:46.900 --> 12:48.336
AND THEN...

12:48.402 --> 12:50.873
WHATEVER EXTRA
WOULD BE DETERMINED
DURING THE DATE.

12:50.940 --> 12:52.608
YOU'D HAVE SEX
WITH THE CLIENTS?

12:52.675 --> 12:54.678
ABOUT 60 TO 70%.

12:54.745 --> 12:56.480
INTERCOURSE?

12:56.547 --> 12:57.415
YES.

12:57.482 --> 12:59.084
ORAL SEX?
DOES IT MATTER?

12:59.151 --> 13:00.085
SHE ADMITTED SHE DID.

13:00.152 --> 13:01.287
ACTUALLY, IT DOES.

13:01.354 --> 13:03.457
SOME KINDS OF SEX ACTS
ARE ILLEGAL

13:03.523 --> 13:05.660
REGARDLESS OF WHETHER
IT'S PROSTITUTION OR NOT.

13:05.726 --> 13:07.128
THERE WAS NONE OF THAT.

13:07.195 --> 13:10.499
AND IT WAS A CONDITION
UPON YOUR EMPLOYMENT
WITH THIS ESCORT SERVICE

13:10.566 --> 13:12.402
THAT YOU HAD SEX
WITH YOUR CLIENTS?

13:13.637 --> 13:14.605
IT WAS UNDERSTOOD.

13:14.672 --> 13:15.940
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

13:16.007 --> 13:19.812
WELL, THEY NEVER SAID
THAT YOU MUST HAVE SEX
WITH THE CLIENTS.

13:19.879 --> 13:21.815
THEY, UH...

13:21.882 --> 13:23.484
ONLY SAID THAT WHATEVER
HAPPENED DURING THE DATE

13:23.550 --> 13:25.052
WOULD BE PRETTY MUCH
UP TO US.

13:25.119 --> 13:28.557
BUT IT BECAME CLEAR
THAT IF YOU REFUSED
TO OBLIGE THE CLIENT,

13:28.624 --> 13:30.393
YOU PROBABLY WOULDN'T
WORK MUCH.

13:30.459 --> 13:33.063
WHAT ABOUT THE MONEY
YOU GOT DIRECTLY
FROM THE CLIENT,

13:33.130 --> 13:34.732
THE NEGOTIATED PART
OF THE DATE?

13:34.799 --> 13:36.735
DID ANY OF THAT GO
TO THE ESCORT SERVICE?

13:36.802 --> 13:38.437
UH, NO.

13:40.940 --> 13:42.643
THIS IS A WASTE
OF MY TIME.

13:42.710 --> 13:44.846
BUT WE ALL KNEW THAT
IT WAS PART OF THE JOB.
IF--IF YOU DIDN'T--

13:44.913 --> 13:47.116
BUT YOU'VE GIVEN ME
ABSOLUTELY NOTHING
I CAN USE

13:47.182 --> 13:48.851
TO GET THIS
ESCORT SERVICE, HAVE YOU?

13:48.918 --> 13:50.153
I DON'T KNOW.

13:50.220 --> 13:52.957
YOU DON'T KNOW?
SEEMS TO ME YOU DO KNOW.

13:53.024 --> 13:55.160
SEEMS TO ME YOU WERE
THE PERFECT EMPLOYEE
OVER THERE.

13:55.227 --> 13:56.762
HEY.
HEY, WHAT?

13:56.829 --> 13:58.697
HELP ME OUT HERE, COUNSEL.
YOU'RE A LAWYER.

13:58.764 --> 14:01.601
JUST WHAT THE HELL HAS
SHE BESTOWED ME WITH HERE?

14:01.668 --> 14:03.003
REMORSE?

14:03.070 --> 14:05.406
I'M SUPPOSED
TO SAY NEVER MIND
BECAUSE SHE LOOKS SAD?

14:05.473 --> 14:08.444
MR. MORRISON,
YOU DON'T KNOW ME.

14:08.511 --> 14:11.915
I HAVE NO RECORD.
MY CRIME HERE IS
PRETTY MUCH VICTIMLESS,

14:11.982 --> 14:14.853
BUT I HAVE 2 CHILDREN
WHO WILL VERY MUCH
BE VICTIMS IF--

14:14.919 --> 14:16.889
YOU SHOULD'VE THOUGHT
ABOUT THAT BEFORE, MA'AM.

14:16.956 --> 14:18.491
I KNOW THAT.

14:20.527 --> 14:22.296
AND I ALSO KNOW THAT
YOU HAVE A JOB TO DO.

14:22.363 --> 14:24.799
I GUESS, UH...

14:24.867 --> 14:28.738
I'M ASSUMING
THAT YOU HAVE
SOME DISCRETION...

14:28.805 --> 14:30.941
AND I'M PLEADING
THAT YOU USE IT HERE...

14:32.377 --> 14:35.381
KNOWING FULL WELL
YOU OWE ME NOTHING.

14:39.252 --> 14:41.489
MAGGOT THERAPY
IS NOT HOCUS-POCUS,

14:41.555 --> 14:43.725
AND I TAKE EXCEPTION
TO THAT SUGGESTION.

14:43.792 --> 14:45.895
IS THIS THERAPY COMMON,
DR. KLOVES?

14:45.961 --> 14:49.666
NOT COMMON, MAYBE.
CERTAINLY EFFECTIVE,
SOMETIMES SUPERIOR.

14:49.733 --> 14:50.835
WHY?

14:50.902 --> 14:53.671
WELL, MANY DRUG THERAPIES
COMBAT BACTERIA,

14:53.739 --> 14:56.342
BUT MAGGOTS NOT ONLY HELP
TO DESTROY BACTERIA,

14:56.409 --> 14:57.944
THEY ALSO HELP
DEBRIDE THE WOUND.

14:58.011 --> 15:01.416
MOREOVER, THEY ACTUALLY HELP
STIMULATE LIVE TISSUE.

15:01.482 --> 15:02.751
DID YOU INFORM
MRS. BLAKE

15:02.818 --> 15:05.554
THAT YOU WERE GOING
TO SEW MAGGOTS
INTO HER LEG?

15:05.622 --> 15:07.590
I COULDN'T AT THE TIME.
SHE WAS STILL UNCONSCIOUS.

15:07.657 --> 15:10.294
I SEE. AND IT'S CHEAPER
TO USE MAGGOTS

15:10.361 --> 15:13.298
THAN SULFUR OR OTHER
COMMERCIAL DRUGS,
ISN'T IT?

15:13.365 --> 15:15.335
THIS WASN'T
ABOUT THE COST.

15:15.401 --> 15:17.303
IT WAS ABOUT THIS THERAPY
BEING THE BEST.

15:17.370 --> 15:18.805
LET ME SEE IF I GET IT.

15:18.872 --> 15:22.077
WHAT HAPPENS IS,
YOU PUT THE MAGGOTS
INTO THE WOUND

15:22.144 --> 15:23.546
TO EAT AT
THE PATIENT'S TISSUE.

15:23.612 --> 15:24.680
YES.

15:24.747 --> 15:28.018
THE MAGGOT SOMEHOW KNOWS
TO EAT ONLY THE DEAD TISSUE.

15:28.085 --> 15:29.654
AND, IF I UNDERSTAND IT,

15:29.720 --> 15:32.190
IT CAN ALSO
KILL BACTERIA
EVEN WITHOUT EATING IT.

15:32.257 --> 15:34.260
YES, IN THEIR
EXCRETIONS,

15:34.326 --> 15:36.563
THERE'S A COMPOUND
THAT'S LETHAL TO BACTERIA.

15:36.629 --> 15:39.067
AND HOW DOES THE MAGGOT
HELP THE LIVE TISSUE?

15:39.133 --> 15:40.835
BY MASSAGING IT,

15:40.902 --> 15:41.836
STIMULATING IT.

15:41.903 --> 15:44.073
YOU MEAN BY...

15:44.140 --> 15:46.109
CRAWLING OVER IT?
YOU KNOW,
SQUIRMING AROUND?

15:46.176 --> 15:47.244
YES.

15:47.311 --> 15:48.512
SQUIRMING AROUND
INSIDE THE PATIENT.

15:48.579 --> 15:49.381
YES.

15:49.447 --> 15:51.449
WHILE IT EATS TISSUE.
YES.

15:51.516 --> 15:53.486
AND WHILE IT EXCRETES
ITS FECES.

15:53.552 --> 15:54.654
YES.

15:54.721 --> 15:56.757
AND WHAT EVENTUALLY
HAPPENS TO THE MAGGOT,
DR. KLOVES?

15:56.824 --> 15:59.795
IT EVENTUALLY
METAMORPHOSES INTO A FLY.

15:59.861 --> 16:01.530
[PEOPLE MURMUR]

E-C-H-O-L-A-L-I-A.

16:11.243 --> 16:12.177
ECHO, WHAT?

16:12.244 --> 16:13.413
ECHOLALIA.

16:13.479 --> 16:16.417
IT MEANS REPEATING A WORD
OVER AND OVER AGAIN.

16:16.483 --> 16:17.952
IT'S PART OF TOURETTE'S.

16:18.019 --> 16:21.089
YEAH, WELL, YOU'RE NOT
GETTING CREDIT FOR IT
UNTIL I LOOK IT UP.

16:21.156 --> 16:22.191
LET'S SEE.

16:22.258 --> 16:24.093
ECHO...

16:26.030 --> 16:27.565
MM-HMM.

16:27.632 --> 16:29.668
IT SEEMS TO BE
A REAL WORD.

16:30.569 --> 16:32.171
OOPS.
SORRY.

16:32.238 --> 16:34.074
YEAH, YOU DID THAT
'CAUSE I'M WINNING.

16:35.443 --> 16:37.378
SHE'S
A WONDERFUL GIRL.

16:37.445 --> 16:38.447
SHE'S VERY BRIGHT,

16:38.513 --> 16:39.614
AND WE'D LOVE
TO KEEP HER,

16:39.681 --> 16:41.851
BUT WE HAVE TO BALANCE
HER INTERESTS

16:41.917 --> 16:44.288
AGAINST THOSE OF
THE OTHERS IN HER CLASS.

16:44.355 --> 16:48.426
AND HOW EXACTLY DOES LISA
COMPROMISE THOSE INTERESTS,
MR. GILBERT?

16:48.493 --> 16:50.229
WELL, UM...

16:50.296 --> 16:53.167
SHE LETS OUT
THESE LITTLE YIPS.

16:53.233 --> 16:55.169
LIKE THIS--YIP, YIP.

16:55.235 --> 16:56.872
AND, UH, WHEN
SHE GETS NERVOUS,

16:56.938 --> 16:58.774
SHE'LL STOMP HER FEET
ON THE FLOOR

16:58.840 --> 17:01.344
OR--OR STAND UP
AND TWIRL AROUND,

17:01.411 --> 17:04.080
AND THIS HAPPENS A LOT
DURING EXAMS.

17:05.249 --> 17:06.685
AND THIS IS WHY
SHE WAS THROWN OUT,

17:06.751 --> 17:09.088
FOR STOMPING HER FOOT
OR MAKING YIP SOUNDS?

17:09.154 --> 17:11.758
I'M THE PRINCIPAL.
I HAVE TO MAKE
THE SCHOOL WORK.

17:11.825 --> 17:13.260
AND DID YOU TALK
TO THE OTHER STUDENTS

17:13.327 --> 17:14.962
TO HELP THEM UNDERSTAND
LISA'S DISORDER?

17:15.029 --> 17:17.232
YES, BUT I CAN'T MANDATE
TO A STUDENT BODY

17:17.299 --> 17:20.737
THAT THEY NOT BE
DISTRACTED BY SOMETHING
THAT DISTRACTS.

17:20.804 --> 17:23.406
I COULD TELL YOU
NOT TO JUMP WHEN
A CAR BACKFIRES,

17:23.473 --> 17:25.675
BUT A BOOM IS A BOOM.

17:25.743 --> 17:27.679
YES, BUT IF A CAR
KEPT GOING BOOM,

17:27.746 --> 17:29.348
I'D EVENTUALLY
GET USED TO IT,

17:29.416 --> 17:30.783
AND WHAT'S TO SAY
THAT LISA'S CLASSMATES

17:30.850 --> 17:32.352
WOULDN'T HAVE GOTTEN USED
TO HER TICS IF--

17:32.420 --> 17:33.787
I'M--I'M TELLING YOU
THEY DIDN'T.

17:33.854 --> 17:36.992
DO YOU KNOW
WHAT THE PHENOMENON OF
HABITUATION IS, MR. GILBERT?

17:37.059 --> 17:40.597
YES, IT'S A FANCY NAME
FOR SAYING "YOU'LL GET
USED TO IT,"

17:40.664 --> 17:42.533
BUT I'M TELLING YOU
THE PROBLEM WAS ONGOING.

17:42.599 --> 17:47.005
THE PROBLEM WAS ONGOING,
IN PART, BECAUSE
THE IGNORANCE WAS ONGOING.

17:47.072 --> 17:50.109
DID YOU EVER EXPLAIN
TO LISA'S CLASSMATES
WHAT TOURETTE'S IS

17:50.177 --> 17:51.545
OR ONLY THAT
SHE HAD IT?

17:51.611 --> 17:53.314
DOCTORS DON'T EXACTLY
UNDERSTAND WHAT IT IS.

17:53.381 --> 17:55.717
NO, THERE IS A LOT
THAT IS UNDERSTOOD,
MR. GILBERT,

17:55.784 --> 17:57.787
AND THE TRUTH IS,
YOU DIDN'T MAKE ANY EFFORT.

17:57.854 --> 17:59.622
WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME
YOU SET FOOT

17:59.689 --> 18:01.792
INTO AN URBAN
PUBLIC SCHOOL, COUNSEL?

18:01.859 --> 18:02.894
PLEASE JUST
ANSWER THE QUESTION.

18:02.961 --> 18:05.430
THE ANSWER IS, WE'D LOVE
TO TAKE TIME OUT

18:05.497 --> 18:07.166
TO TEND TO
SPECIAL NEEDS,

18:07.233 --> 18:10.204
BUT WE'RE UNDERFUNDED,
UNDERSTAFFED,
AND OVERPOPULATED.

18:10.271 --> 18:12.807
THERE'S A NAME FOR IT.
IT'S CALLED
PUBLIC SCHOOL,

18:12.874 --> 18:15.644
AND LIKE IT OR NOT,
WE'RE NOT ABOUT
INDIVIDUAL ATTENTION.

18:15.711 --> 18:17.847
WE'RE ABOUT TEACHING
LARGE GROUPS--

18:17.914 --> 18:20.284
THROWING THE EDUCATION
AT A BUNCH OF STUDENTS

18:20.350 --> 18:22.120
ALL LUMPED
INTO ONE BIG GROUP

18:22.187 --> 18:25.424
AND HOPING TO HELL
THE LEARNING STICKS
WITH MORE KIDS THAN NOT.

18:25.491 --> 18:27.927
MM-HMM, AND IF
ONE KID IS DIFFERENT,
JUST THROW HER OUT.

18:27.995 --> 18:31.733
IF SHE'S
ADVERSELY AFFECTING
EVERYBODY ELSE,

18:31.800 --> 18:33.067
YES.

18:33.134 --> 18:34.737
HMM.

18:34.804 --> 18:36.839
SO, BASICALLY,
I'M SUNK.

18:36.907 --> 18:39.143
WELL, IT ISN'T OVER YET.
HE SAID HE'D THINK
ABOUT IT.

18:39.210 --> 18:40.477
LET'S--LET'S JUST WAIT.

18:40.544 --> 18:41.913
BUT YOU DON'T HOLD OUT
MUCH HOPE.

18:41.979 --> 18:44.350
THIS DETECTIVE
ISN'T ONE OF THE MORE
COMPASSIONATE ONES.

18:44.417 --> 18:45.852
WE COULD STILL
GO TO TRIAL, THOUGH.

18:45.919 --> 18:47.487
THIS CASE
ISN'T A SLAM DUNK.

18:47.554 --> 18:51.059
IF WE GO TO TRIAL,
HOW WILL MY KIDS...

18:51.126 --> 18:52.628
NOT FIND OUT?

18:53.829 --> 18:57.034
I MEAN, THAT'S
THE WHOLE POINT.
I CAN'T.

18:57.100 --> 19:01.606

IF MY HUSBAND EVER
CHALLENGES FOR CUSTODY...

19:05.478 --> 19:06.747
I KNOW.

19:08.382 --> 19:09.651
I MADE MY BED HERE.

19:13.822 --> 19:15.759
WELL, THANKS
FOR WALKING ME.

19:17.862 --> 19:18.796
YEAH.

19:22.201 --> 19:24.270
DO YOU REMEMBER
THE FIRST TIME
YOU WALKED ME TO THE DOOR?

19:26.006 --> 19:27.508
I REMEMBER IT TOOK ME
20 MINUTES

19:27.575 --> 19:29.911
JUST TO WORK UP
THE COURAGE TO KISS YOU,

19:29.978 --> 19:32.247
THEN JUST AS
I STARTED TO,

19:32.314 --> 19:33.949
YOUR FATHER
OPENED THE DOOR.

19:34.017 --> 19:36.353
YEAH, AND HE SAID,
"WHOOPS, SORRY,"

19:36.420 --> 19:38.590
THEN HE CLOSED
THE DOOR,

19:38.656 --> 19:40.959
AND IT TOOK YOU
ANOTHER 20 MINUTES.

19:41.026 --> 19:42.328
YEAH.

[DOOR OPENS]

19:50.472 --> 19:51.507
HI.

19:51.573 --> 19:53.109
WHERE DO YOU THINK
YOU'RE GOING?

19:53.175 --> 19:55.045
[SARCASTIC]
HELLO.

19:55.112 --> 19:57.148
I'M GOING TO SUZIE'S
TO EAT, REMEMBER?

19:57.215 --> 19:58.216
YEAH.

19:59.384 --> 20:00.585
THIS--

20:00.653 --> 20:01.821
AHEM--

20:01.887 --> 20:03.657
IS MY DAUGHTER
MELISSA.

20:03.724 --> 20:05.058
THIS IS MR. DONNELL.

HI.

20:07.529 --> 20:09.164
MOM...

20:09.231 --> 20:11.700
MOM, STEVIE PEABODY HIT ME
IN THE EYE WITH A STICK.

20:11.768 --> 20:13.970
I CAN SEE THAT.
IT'S ALL RED.

20:14.038 --> 20:15.673
Melissa:
HE HIT STEVIE FIRST.

20:15.740 --> 20:16.641
YOU WEREN'T THERE.

20:16.707 --> 20:18.243
BYE, MOM.

20:19.711 --> 20:22.682
BYE. DID YOU HIT STEVIE
FIRST, SWEETIE?

20:22.749 --> 20:24.251
WELL, HE LOOKED
AT ME FUNNY.

20:24.317 --> 20:26.554
ARE WE SUPPOSED
TO HIT PEOPLE
WHO LOOK AT US FUNNY?

20:26.621 --> 20:27.956
NO.

20:28.022 --> 20:30.393
WELL, DO YOU THINK
MAYBE I SHOULD JUST
KISS THAT EYE?

20:30.460 --> 20:32.362
DO YOU THINK
THAT WOULD HELP?

20:32.428 --> 20:33.430
YEAH.

20:33.497 --> 20:35.132
YOU KNOW,
I THINK IT MIGHT.

20:35.199 --> 20:37.936
THEN WHY DO YOU THINK STEVIE
LOOKED AT YOU FUNNY?

20:38.003 --> 20:41.841
MAYBE 'CAUSE HE KNEW
I WAS ABOUT TO HIT HIM.

20:45.881 --> 20:48.117
I'M SUPPOSED TO
SECOND CHAIR FOR LINDSAY.

20:48.184 --> 20:50.052
I'M OK.
THEIR LAST WITNESS
IS JUST ON THE SURGERY.

20:50.119 --> 20:51.053
THERE'S NOTHING
IN DISPUTE.

20:51.121 --> 20:52.055
IT'S ONLY
FOR THIS MORNING.

20:52.122 --> 20:54.024

HEY, YOU ALL SET?

20:54.092 --> 20:55.226
THANKS.

FOR KNOWING THE COMPUTERS.

20:58.130 --> 21:00.066

SEE IF YOU CAN RETRIEVE
MY CLOSING.

21:00.133 --> 21:01.702

OVER THERE ATE IT.

21:01.768 --> 21:04.606
I COULD SECOND CHAIR
FOR YOU, LINDSAY.
MY MORNING'S CLEAR.

21:04.672 --> 21:05.673
OH, THAT'S OK.

21:05.740 --> 21:07.075
ACTUALLY, I'D SORT OF
ENJOY IT.

21:07.142 --> 21:08.744
I HAVEN'T BEEN TO COURT
IN A COUPLE OF WEEKS.

21:08.811 --> 21:10.747
I--I'M FINE, REALLY.

21:10.814 --> 21:12.282
YOU KNOW,
IT'S NO PROBLEM.

21:12.349 --> 21:14.252
UH, ACTUALLY, I'M--

21:14.319 --> 21:17.890
YOU KNOW, IT CAN THROW
THE JURY IF A NEW LAWYER
SUDDENLY APPEARS.

21:17.957 --> 21:20.060
I'D RATHER NOT RISK IT.

21:21.428 --> 21:22.830
EXCUSE ME.

21:22.896 --> 21:23.898
UH, IS BOBBY HERE?

21:23.965 --> 21:25.834
YEAH. RIGHT HERE.

21:25.900 --> 21:28.070
CAN I TALK TO YOU
IN PRIVATE?

21:28.138 --> 21:29.339
SURE.

21:37.250 --> 21:39.353
HOW COME LINDSAY DOESN'T
WANT ME AT HER TABLE?

21:40.554 --> 21:42.390
CASE IS JUST
ABOUT OVER, JIMMY.

21:42.457 --> 21:43.959
NO REAL POINT.

21:47.930 --> 21:49.767
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
HE--HE CALLED YOU?

21:49.833 --> 21:51.369
JUST WHAT I SAID.

21:52.837 --> 21:54.573
BOBBY, WHAT DO YOU KNOW
ABOUT THIS DETECTIVE?

21:54.639 --> 21:56.642
NOTHING MUCH
AND NOTHING GOOD.

21:56.709 --> 21:58.545
YOU MEAN TO TELL ME
HE CALLED YOU?

21:58.612 --> 22:00.047
AT YOUR HOME?

22:00.114 --> 22:02.917
HE BASICALLY OFFERED ME
A QUID PRO QUO.

22:02.985 --> 22:05.020
I GET OFF
IF I GET HIM OFF FIRST.

22:06.690 --> 22:08.892
COULD THIS BE
SOME KIND OF STING?

22:08.959 --> 22:10.461
WHY WOULD HE STING YOU?
HE'S ALREADY GOT YOU.

22:10.528 --> 22:11.696
THAT'S WHAT I FIGURED.

22:11.762 --> 22:13.999
YOU--YOU GOT ANY WAY
OF PROVING THIS?

22:14.065 --> 22:15.034
NO.

22:16.503 --> 22:17.938
ALL RIGHT.

22:18.005 --> 22:20.975
TELL ME EXACTLY--
AND I MEAN EXACTLY--

22:21.042 --> 22:22.311
WHAT DID HE SAY?

22:22.377 --> 22:23.846
EXACTLY...

22:23.913 --> 22:25.881
HE SAID...

22:25.948 --> 22:28.385
THAT HE IS
A LONELY MAN,

22:28.452 --> 22:30.655
AND IF I WOULD
KEEP HIM COMPANY FOR
A HALF AN HOUR OR SO,

22:30.722 --> 22:31.789
HE WOULDN'T FILE.

22:31.856 --> 22:33.526
DETECTIVE MORRISON
SAID THIS?

22:33.592 --> 22:35.695
HE ALSO SAID THAT IF I
REITERATED THIS TO YOU,

22:35.762 --> 22:37.832
HE WOULD DENY IT,
AND THE DEAL WAS OFF.

22:37.898 --> 22:40.201
ALL RIGHT, WELL, HOW--
HOW DID YOU LEAVE IT?

22:40.268 --> 22:43.472
HE SAID HE'S COMING TO
MY CONDO TOMORROW NIGHT,

22:43.539 --> 22:45.041
AND I'M EITHER TO SAY,

22:45.107 --> 22:46.476
"WHAT A SURPRISE.
COME IN,"

22:46.543 --> 22:47.344
OR "I'M BUSY,"

22:47.410 --> 22:49.247
DEPENDING ON
WHAT THE ANSWER IS.

22:49.313 --> 22:52.051
NO OTHER DISCUSSION,
OR THE DEAL'S OFF.

22:52.117 --> 22:53.586
I DON'T BELIEVE THIS.

23:02.598 --> 23:05.469
SO WHAT SHOULD I DO?

23:06.837 --> 23:10.408
I GOT TO THINK. JUST--
JUST LET ME THINK.

23:12.945 --> 23:15.282
I'VE HEARD FROM YOUR DAD,
AND I'VE HEARD
FROM YOUR LAWYER,

23:15.348 --> 23:17.185
BUT I'D REALLY LIKE
TO HEAR FROM YOU.

23:17.251 --> 23:18.653
Ellenor: CAN I JUST
SAY ONE THING
BEFORE WE BEGIN?

23:18.720 --> 23:19.554
OF COURSE.

23:19.621 --> 23:22.291
AS YOU TALK ABOUT HER
TWITCHING OR TICCING,

23:22.358 --> 23:24.528
SHE'S MORE LIKELY
TO DO IT.
POWER OF SUGGESTION.

23:24.595 --> 23:25.896
I UNDERSTAND.

23:25.962 --> 23:27.499
LISA...

23:27.565 --> 23:31.036
I'VE HEARD YOUR TICS
DISTRACT THE OTHER STUDENTS.

23:31.103 --> 23:32.138
DO YOU THINK
THAT'S TRUE?

23:36.811 --> 23:38.246
SHE'LL BE BACK.

23:38.313 --> 23:40.516
DOES SHE DO THAT
IN CLASS?

23:40.582 --> 23:41.450
SOMETIMES.

23:45.823 --> 23:48.427
DO YOU THINK
IT'S FAIR THAT--

23:49.561 --> 23:51.397
IF YOUR BEHAVIOR...

23:51.464 --> 23:54.000
MAKES IT HARDER FOR
THE OTHER STUDENTS
TO LEARN

23:54.067 --> 23:57.004
OR HARDER FOR
THE TEACHERS TO TEACH,

23:57.071 --> 24:00.609
IS IT FAIR FOR YOU
TO WANT TO BE THERE?

24:00.676 --> 24:03.313
I GUESS IT DEPENDS
ON WHAT'S BEING TAUGHT.

24:03.380 --> 24:05.215
AND IT'S IMPORTANT THAT
YOU GO TO A PUBLIC SCHOOL

24:05.282 --> 24:06.818
RATHER THAN A SPECIALIZED
PRIVATE ONE?

24:06.885 --> 24:07.919
YES.

24:07.986 --> 24:09.155
WHY?

24:11.824 --> 24:15.163
BECAUSE WHEN I GROW UP,
I'M GOING TO LIVE
MY LIFE OUT IN THE OPEN.

24:15.229 --> 24:20.236
WE MIGHT AS WELL
START GETTING USED
TO EACH OTHER NOW.

24:20.303 --> 24:21.571
DO THE LAWYERS
HAVE ANY QUESTIONS?

24:23.006 --> 24:23.941
NOT ME.

24:24.008 --> 24:25.109
UH...

24:25.176 --> 24:27.245
JUST A COUPLE.

24:27.312 --> 24:28.581
LISA...

24:32.119 --> 24:34.522
WHEN YOU MAKE
SOUNDS OR NOISES,

24:34.589 --> 24:37.393
DOES THE TEACHER HAVE
TO REPEAT THINGS OVER AGAIN
FOR THE CLASS?

24:37.459 --> 24:39.161
YES.

24:39.228 --> 24:42.433
DO YOU THINK SOMETIMES
YOU SLOW THE CLASS DOWN?

24:42.500 --> 24:44.736
MAYBE SOMETIMES,
BUT NOT MUCH.

24:44.803 --> 24:46.271
HMM.

24:46.338 --> 24:48.508
NOW, THERE ARE MEDICATIONS,
AREN'T THERE,

24:48.574 --> 24:49.876
THAT WOULD HELP CONTROL
YOUR TICCINGS?

24:49.943 --> 24:51.244
[YELPS]

24:51.312 --> 24:52.713
YES, BUT I DON'T
LIKE THEM.

24:52.780 --> 24:54.549
THEY MAKE ME
FEEL SLUGGISH.

25:02.126 --> 25:04.529
WHAT IT REALLY COMES DOWN TO
IS FORESEEABLITY.

25:04.595 --> 25:07.166
WAS IT FORESEEABLE
THAT THIS WOMAN

25:07.233 --> 25:10.403
MIGHT HAVE A NEGATIVE
PSYCHOLOGICAL REACTION

25:10.470 --> 25:12.974
TO THOSE GROSS,
DISGUSTING THINGS

25:13.041 --> 25:14.543
SQUIRMING AROUND INSIDE HER?

25:14.609 --> 25:15.510
LOOK AT THAT.

25:15.577 --> 25:18.915
IMAGINE THEM BITING,
GNAWING AWAY AT YOUR TISSUE

25:18.982 --> 25:22.019
EXCRETING THEIR
REPULSIVE LITTLE
MAGGOT FECES INSIDE YOU.

25:22.086 --> 25:24.823
THERE WERE OTHER
ALTERNATIVES--

25:24.890 --> 25:26.024
DRUGS.

25:26.091 --> 25:27.493
NOT AS CHEAP AS MAGGOTS,
I GRANT YOU,

25:27.560 --> 25:29.997
AND WE DO HAVE TO BE CONCERNED
WITH RISING HEALTH COSTS.

25:30.064 --> 25:31.599
ABSOLUTELY.

25:31.666 --> 25:34.135
BUT THIS IS A HUMAN BEING
SITTING HERE.

25:36.305 --> 25:38.708
MY CLIENT PERFORMED
A VERY DIFFICULT PROCEDURE.

25:40.177 --> 25:42.346
HE HAD TO REATTACH ARTERIES.

25:42.413 --> 25:44.483
HE HAD TO PIECE TOGETHER
PIECES OF BONE,

25:44.549 --> 25:46.719
AND THEN HE HAD TO COMBAT
A SEVERE RISK

25:46.786 --> 25:48.221
OF BACTERIAL INFECTION,

25:48.288 --> 25:51.893
AND HE TREATED THAT THREAT
WITH THE BEST THERAPY
AVAILABLE TO HIM,

25:51.959 --> 25:54.162
AND IT WORKED.

25:54.229 --> 25:57.200
IT WAS A COMPLETE SUCCESS.

25:57.267 --> 25:59.036
MRS. BLAKE WALKS TODAY

25:59.103 --> 26:01.339
ONLY BECAUSE
OF DR. KLOVES'

26:01.406 --> 26:02.941
SUPERIOR
MEDICAL PERFORMANCE,

26:03.008 --> 26:05.211
AND SHE'S SUING HIM.

26:07.681 --> 26:10.284
YOUR HONOR, COULD I ASK
THE PLAINTIFF--

26:10.351 --> 26:11.920
MRS. BLAKE,
IF YOU COULD REFRAIN
FROM SCRATCHING

26:11.986 --> 26:13.989
DURING DEFENSE
COUNSEL'S SUMMATION.

26:14.056 --> 26:15.792
WILL IT BE LONG?

26:15.859 --> 26:17.594
I COULD GO TO HIS SUPERIOR,

26:17.661 --> 26:20.965
OR I COULD--I COULD TRY
TO BACK HIM DOWN

26:21.033 --> 26:22.735
BY REVERSING THE THREAT.

26:22.801 --> 26:23.836
IF HE--

26:23.902 --> 26:24.637
HE SAID
IF I EVEN TOLD YOU.

26:26.506 --> 26:28.308
BOBBY, UNLESS YOU HAVE
SOME KIND OF GUARANTEED PLAN,

26:28.375 --> 26:29.510
I DON'T WANT YOU
GOING TO HIM.

26:29.577 --> 26:33.983
OK, UM, MAYBE
IF YOU WORE A WIRE.

26:34.050 --> 26:36.519
THAT'S WHY HE SAID
NO DISCUSSION.

26:36.587 --> 26:39.290
HE'S ALREADY PREPARED
FOR THAT.

26:39.357 --> 26:41.226
BOBBY, EVEN IF WE
COULD TRAP HIM,

26:41.293 --> 26:44.364
I'M NOT SURE...

26:44.430 --> 26:47.134
IF WE EXPOSE HIM,
IT'S NEWS.

26:47.201 --> 26:48.603
THAT WOULD BE
IN THE PAPERS FOR SURE.

26:48.670 --> 26:49.938
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO TELL YOU, SHARON.

26:50.005 --> 26:52.608
I MEAN, I KNOW YOU DON'T
WANT ANY OF THIS GETTING OUT,

26:52.675 --> 26:54.277
BUT YOUR ONLY OPTION HERE
SEEMS TO BE

26:54.344 --> 26:56.280
TO ROLL THE DICE
WITH A TRIAL OR PLEAD.

27:00.018 --> 27:02.288
THAT'S NOT
MY ONLY OPTION.

27:05.559 --> 27:09.231
MAYBE THE SMARTEST THING
IS TO JUST GIVE HIM
WHAT HE WANTS.

27:09.298 --> 27:11.333
YOU CAN'T BE SERIOUS.

27:11.401 --> 27:13.970
IF IT'LL MAKE IT
ALL GO AWAY.

27:14.037 --> 27:16.908
BOBBY, I'M A PROSTITUTE.

27:16.974 --> 27:19.111
WHAT WOULD I BE DOING
THAT I HAVEN'T DONE
BEFORE?

27:19.177 --> 27:20.646
SHARON...

27:22.582 --> 27:24.018
DO YOU HAVE A BETTER PLAN?

27:24.084 --> 27:25.820
WELL, WE COULD TALK
TO THE D.A.,

27:25.886 --> 27:27.655
TURN STATE'S EVIDENCE
AGAINST MORRISON.

27:27.723 --> 27:31.761
IN WHICH CASE,
HE SAYS IT'S MY WORD
AGAINST HIS.

27:31.828 --> 27:33.030
SHOULD THEY BELIEVE ME,

27:33.096 --> 27:34.832
THIS BECOMES
AND EVEN BIGGER SCANDAL.

27:34.898 --> 27:37.402
WELL, AS YOUR LAWYER,
I AM CERTAINLY NOT
GOING TO COUNSEL YOU

27:37.469 --> 27:38.670
TOWARDS PROSTITUTION.

27:38.737 --> 27:40.706
RIGHT.

27:44.812 --> 27:46.914
AS YOUR FRIEND...

27:46.982 --> 27:48.584
AND AS MY FRIEND...

27:49.986 --> 27:53.157
YOU HAVE TO ADMIT
THIS MAY BE THE BEST WAY

27:53.223 --> 27:54.358
TO MAKE THIS
WHOLE THING GO AWAY.

27:54.425 --> 27:56.027
I MEAN, THIS COULD BE
MY ONLY WAY.

28:05.139 --> 28:06.107
I'VE DONE IT FOR MONEY.

28:06.174 --> 28:08.744
WHY AM I
SUDDENLY TOO PROUD
TO DO IT FOR MY KIDS?

28:14.986 --> 28:16.288
[DOOR OPENS]

28:16.354 --> 28:18.324
TRUTH IS I CAN SEE
THEIR SIDE OF IT.

28:18.391 --> 28:19.492
IT HAS TO BE DISTRACTING
IF SHE DOES IN CLASS--

28:19.558 --> 28:21.795
SHE HAS THE RIGHT
TO AN EDUCATION, EUGENE.

28:21.862 --> 28:23.130
I'M NOT SAYING
THAT SHE DOESN'T,

28:23.197 --> 28:25.233
BUT THIS MAINSTREAMING
THING CAN GET
CARRIED AWAY.

28:25.300 --> 28:28.170
LINDSAY,
COULD I HAVE A SECOND,
PLEASE?

28:28.237 --> 28:29.306
SURE.

28:29.372 --> 28:31.909
YOU WANT TO GO
INTO THE CONFERENCE ROOM?

28:31.975 --> 28:33.444
NO. IT'S OK.

28:33.511 --> 28:36.015
I'D JUST LIKE
AN HONEST ANSWER

28:36.081 --> 28:38.218
AS TO WHY YOU DIDN'T
WANT ME WITH YOU IN COURT.

28:38.284 --> 28:41.388
OH, THAT. WELL...

28:41.455 --> 28:43.825
AND I'D APPRECIATE
YOU NOT INSULTING

28:43.891 --> 28:45.460
WHAT LITTLE
INTELLIGENCE I HAVE

28:45.527 --> 28:48.798
WITH SOME STORY ABOUT
JURIES GETTING SPOOKED

28:48.865 --> 28:50.968
BY NEW FACES.

28:51.035 --> 28:52.537
I'D LIKE THE TRUTH.

28:56.208 --> 28:57.544
OK.

29:03.852 --> 29:06.689
I HAVE A CLIENT
WHO COULD BE PERCEIVED
AS, UM...

29:06.756 --> 29:08.458
A LITTLE TOO QUICK TO SUE.

29:08.525 --> 29:10.194
I'M WORRIED ONE OR MORE
OF THE JURORS

29:10.261 --> 29:11.162
MIGHT HAVE SEEN
YOUR COMMERCIAL.

29:11.228 --> 29:12.264
AND?

29:12.330 --> 29:16.302
AND, UM,
WITH A LITIGIOUS PLAINTIFF,

29:16.369 --> 29:18.238
I DON'T THINK
IT HELPS OUR CAUSE

29:18.305 --> 29:22.711
TO BE ASSOCIATED
WITH JIMMY THE GRUNT.

29:25.314 --> 29:26.716
GO TO HELL.

29:27.818 --> 29:28.819
JIMMY...

29:29.953 --> 29:31.756
SHE'S NOT WRONG.

29:34.026 --> 29:35.728
YOU GO TO HELL, TOO.

29:56.857 --> 29:57.725
OH, HI.

29:57.791 --> 30:00.562
HI, MELISSA. IS, UH,
IS YOUR MOM HOME?

30:00.629 --> 30:02.798
ARE YOU TWO, LIKE,
GOING TOGETHER?

30:02.865 --> 30:04.367
NEVER MIND, HONEY.
GO GET YOUR COAT.
WE'RE RUNNING LATE.

30:04.434 --> 30:05.636
HERE, TOAST.

30:05.702 --> 30:06.970
CAN I TALK TO YOU?

30:08.806 --> 30:10.876
SHARON, WHAT YOU'RE
CONSIDERING HERE--

30:10.943 --> 30:13.579
BOBBY, THIS IS NOT
THE PLACE FOR THIS DISCUSSION.

30:13.646 --> 30:15.515
I CANNOT JUST SIT BACK
AND WATCH YOU DO THIS.

30:15.582 --> 30:17.451
I WILL GO TO YOUR OFFICE.

30:17.518 --> 30:19.454
WE ARE NOT
DISCUSSING THIS HERE.

30:19.520 --> 30:22.058
FINE.

30:23.893 --> 30:24.727
I'M READY.

30:24.794 --> 30:26.664
MM-HMM. OK.
LET'S GET YOUR BROTHER.

30:26.730 --> 30:28.099
SEE YOU AT YOUR OFFICE.

30:28.166 --> 30:29.568
OK.

30:33.005 --> 30:34.174
IT WOULD BE NICE,
YOUR HONOR,

30:34.240 --> 30:37.444
IF WE COULD MAINSTREAM
ALL THE CHILDREN LIKE LISA,

30:37.512 --> 30:39.547
AND IT WOULD BE GREAT,
WOULDN'T IT,

30:39.614 --> 30:43.219
IF WE COULD ERADICATE
IGNORANCE AND INTOLERANCE

30:43.286 --> 30:45.890
WITH ONE WAVE OF A WAND.

30:45.956 --> 30:48.760
WAVE IT ONCE MORE
AND MAKE EVERYBODY NORMAL,

30:48.827 --> 30:51.898
BUT TODAY WE'RE STUCK
WITH REALITY.

30:51.964 --> 30:53.934
AND LIKE
PRINCIPAL GILBERT TOLD US,

30:54.001 --> 30:56.704
THE REALITY
OF PUBLIC SCHOOLS IS UGLY:

30:56.771 --> 30:59.641
OVERCROWDED, UNDERFUNDED,
UNDERSTAFFED.

30:59.708 --> 31:02.779
IT'S ALL WE CAN DO
TO MAKE IT FUNCTION.

31:02.846 --> 31:04.881
I MEAN, FORGET ABOUT
INDIVIDUAL ATTENTION.

31:04.949 --> 31:07.652
IT'S EDUCATION
FOR THE MASSES.

31:07.719 --> 31:11.257
AND AS REMARKABLE
AS LISA WRIGHT IS--

31:11.324 --> 31:13.160
AND SHE IS...

31:15.029 --> 31:17.699
SHE IS ALSO A WRENCH
IN A SYSTEM

31:17.766 --> 31:19.969
THAT IS ALREADY
LIMPING BADLY.

31:20.036 --> 31:25.476
YOUR HONOR, THERE ARE 400
OTHER KIDS AT WHEATON EAST.

31:25.543 --> 31:27.612
THEY COUNT, TOO.

31:33.154 --> 31:35.222
YOUR HONOR,
REBECCA WASHINGTON
FROM MY FIRM

31:35.289 --> 31:36.892
IS AGAIN WITH US.

31:36.959 --> 31:38.961
SHE'S NOT A MEMBER
OF THE BAR,

31:39.028 --> 31:40.664
BUT WOULD IT BE
ALL RIGHT FOR HER
TO ADDRESS THE COURT?

31:40.730 --> 31:41.999
IF THE CLIENT
DOESN'T OBJECT.

31:46.304 --> 31:47.406
THANK YOU, YOUR HONOR.

31:47.473 --> 31:49.642
AHEM.

31:50.643 --> 31:52.680
I JUST WANTED TO SAY

31:52.746 --> 31:57.853
EVERYBODY SEEMS TO BE
BALANCING LISA'S INTERESTS

31:57.920 --> 31:59.755
AGAINST THE INTERESTS
OF THE OTHER STUDENTS,

31:59.823 --> 32:00.791
BUT FROM WHERE I SIT,

32:00.857 --> 32:02.726
THEY DON'T CLASH.

32:02.794 --> 32:05.798
AFTER KNOWING HER
EVEN FOR ONE DAY,

32:05.864 --> 32:09.302
ANY CHILD SHOULD BE
SO LUCKY AS TO GO TO SCHOOL

32:09.368 --> 32:11.305
WITH SOMEBODY
LIKE THIS GIRL.

32:11.371 --> 32:12.707
EVEN SO,
MS. WASHINGTON,

32:12.773 --> 32:14.475
TO KNOW HER
IS NOT THE SAME

32:14.542 --> 32:15.944
AS HAVING
TO ATTEND SCHOOL
WITH HER.

32:16.011 --> 32:19.516
BUT A SCHOOL NEEDS TO BE
MORE THAN JUST READING
AND WRITING.

32:19.582 --> 32:23.855
SCHOOL IS THE FIRST
REAL WORLD FOR A KID,

32:23.922 --> 32:25.257
AND IT SHOULD BE A PLACE
THAT SAYS,

32:25.324 --> 32:27.026
"GEE, YOU KNOW,
WE'D LIKE TO BE TOLERANT,

32:27.092 --> 32:29.996
BUT ORDER AND DECORUM
HAVE TO COME FIRST."

32:31.465 --> 32:36.105
MAYBE THE SCHOOL
SHOULD TEACH CHILDREN
NOT TO DISCRIMINATE,

32:36.172 --> 32:39.844
NOT TO BE PREJUDICED
AGAINST PEOPLE
WHO ARE DIFFERENT

32:39.910 --> 32:43.882
AND THEN GET AROUND
TO PHONICS AND ARITHMETIC.

32:43.949 --> 32:45.952
YOU RAISE SOME
INTERESTING IDEALS,

32:46.018 --> 32:49.690
BUT THE ORDER OF THE DAY
IS TO MAKE THE SCHOOLS
FUNCTION.

32:49.757 --> 32:52.994
NO, THE ORDER OF THE DAY,
AS I'VE BEEN LISTENING,

32:53.061 --> 32:55.998
IS TO DO WHAT'S BEST
FOR THE STUDENTS
AT WHEATON EAST.

32:56.065 --> 32:58.334
NOW YOU'VE MET LISA WRIGHT.

32:58.402 --> 33:01.373
YOU'VE SEEN HER TICS
INTERRUPT YOUR COURTROOM.

33:01.439 --> 33:06.179
BALANCE ALL THAT,
AND YOU'RE GLAD YOU MET HER.

33:06.245 --> 33:08.682
YOU'RE BETTER OFF.

33:08.749 --> 33:11.586
GIVE THOSE STUDENTS
THE BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT,

33:11.652 --> 33:13.956
THAT THEY CAN LEARN
TO TOLERATE LISA.

33:14.023 --> 33:17.995
IN THE END, IT'S LIKE
WHAT LISA HERSELF SAID--

33:18.061 --> 33:22.234
YOU CAN LET HER STAY,
OR YOU CAN KICK HER OUT.

33:23.435 --> 33:27.073
ALL DEPENDS ON WHAT IT IS
YOU'RE TRYING TO TEACH.

33:28.810 --> 33:30.144
THANK YOU.

33:36.520 --> 33:38.789
Judge: MR. FOREMAN,
HAS THE JURY
REACHED ITS VERDICT?

33:38.856 --> 33:40.391
WE HAVE, YOUR HONOR.

33:40.458 --> 33:41.793
WHAT SAY YOU?

33:41.860 --> 33:43.262
WE FIND IN FAVOR
OF THE PLAINTIFF

33:43.329 --> 33:45.698
AND ORDER THAT
THE DEFENDANT PAY DAMAGES

33:45.765 --> 33:48.970
IN THE AMOUNT
OF $62,000.

33:49.037 --> 33:50.605
Judge:
THE JURY IS DISMISSED
WITH THE THANKS OF THE COURT.

33:50.672 --> 33:52.274
WE'RE ADJOURNED.

33:52.341 --> 33:53.576
THAT ISN'T VERY MUCH.

33:53.643 --> 33:54.544
Lindsay:
HEY, WE WON,

33:54.610 --> 33:55.812
AND IT'S TAX-FREE.

33:55.879 --> 33:57.348
THIS IS
A GREAT RESULT.

33:57.414 --> 33:58.816
I DON'T KNOW.

33:58.883 --> 34:00.753
WAY TO GO, LINDSAY.

34:00.819 --> 34:02.488
THANKS.

34:02.555 --> 34:05.625
ONLY COMES TO 1,200
PER MAGGOT.

34:05.692 --> 34:07.462
SEEMS LOW.

34:10.299 --> 34:12.902
I'D APPRECIATE
YOU NOT COMING
TO MY HOME LIKE THAT.

34:12.969 --> 34:14.536
YOU WOULDN'T RETURN
MY PHONE CALLS.

34:14.603 --> 34:15.839
WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO?

34:21.981 --> 34:23.416
YOU'RE GOING TO DO IT,
AREN'T YOU?

34:23.483 --> 34:25.085
I DON'T KNOW.

34:25.152 --> 34:28.623
OH, MY GOD, SHARON,
HOW CAN YOU EVEN THINK
OF IT?

34:28.690 --> 34:30.726
TELL ME ANOTHER WAY,
BOBBY.

34:30.793 --> 34:32.161
GIVE ME
THE SUREFIRE PLAN.

34:32.228 --> 34:34.732
YOU THINK THIS HELPS
YOUR CHILDREN

34:34.799 --> 34:36.567
FOR YOU TO DO THIS?

34:36.634 --> 34:38.235
OF COURSE IT HELPS THEM.

34:38.303 --> 34:41.674
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA HOW
DEVASTATED THEY'D BE?

34:41.741 --> 34:42.675
THEIR FATHER
WALKED OUT ON THEM.

34:42.742 --> 34:44.143
IN TERMS OF ROLE MODELS,
I AM IT.

34:44.210 --> 34:47.449
THOSE KIDS NEED A MOTHER
WITH SOME KIND OF SELF-ESTEEM,

34:47.516 --> 34:49.351
AND IF YOU DO WHAT
YOU'RE THINKING OF DOING,

34:49.418 --> 34:50.453
IT'LL CATCH UP WITH YOU.

34:50.520 --> 34:52.022
THAT RIGHT?

34:52.088 --> 34:55.192
BEING A WHORE
CATCHES UP.

34:56.193 --> 34:59.031
I'VE REPRESENTED
ENOUGH OF THEM TO KNOW.

34:59.097 --> 35:02.669
YOU'VE ALSO REPRESENTED
RAPISTS AND MURDERERS,
BOBBY.

35:02.736 --> 35:04.304
WHAT'S THAT
SUPPOSED TO MEAN?

35:04.371 --> 35:08.043
IT MEANS
WE MAY HAVE GONE DOWN
DIFFERENT PATHS,

35:08.110 --> 35:12.683
BUT WE BOTH ENDED UP
DOING DESPICABLE THINGS
FOR A FEE.

35:12.750 --> 35:15.086
DON'T TELL ME
YOU FREE CHILD MOLESTERS

35:15.153 --> 35:16.521
TO GRATIFY YOUR SOUL.

35:16.588 --> 35:18.223
YOU THINK MY JOB
IS WHORING?

35:18.290 --> 35:21.127
I THINK WE BOTH
MADE COMPROMISES.

35:21.194 --> 35:24.966
THE ONES I'VE MADE
HAVE BEEN MORE STUPID,

35:25.032 --> 35:27.670
BUT THEY HAVE BEEN MADE
TO PROVIDE FOR MY KIDS.

35:27.736 --> 35:28.737
WHAT IS YOUR EXCUSE?

35:28.804 --> 35:31.708
HEY, YOU KNOW NOTHING
ABOUT ME.

35:31.775 --> 35:34.312
YOU KNOW NOTHING
ABOUT ME!

35:35.814 --> 35:37.583
SO WHY DON'T WE JUST
CALL THIS EVEN?

35:37.649 --> 35:38.951
I AM NOT
GOING TO JUDGE YOU,

35:39.018 --> 35:40.387
YOU DON'T JUDGE ME!

35:42.089 --> 35:45.026
LISTEN, I CAN BRING MYSELF
TO UNDERSTAND

35:45.093 --> 35:48.097
YOU DO THIS CALL GIRL THING
ONCE OR TWICE

35:48.164 --> 35:50.000
TO DIG YOURSELF OUT.

35:50.066 --> 35:51.869
IT CONTINUES AND THE MONEY...

35:51.936 --> 35:53.705
BUT WHAT
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT NOW,

35:53.771 --> 35:55.841
IT'S MORE REPULSIVE.

35:55.908 --> 35:57.643
IT'S WORSE.

35:59.746 --> 36:02.650
PLEASE DON'T DO IT.

36:09.827 --> 36:11.562
I DON'T WANT TO DO IT.

36:14.666 --> 36:16.436
I HOPE I DON'T.

36:17.637 --> 36:19.573
MAYBE I WON'T.

36:20.775 --> 36:22.143
LOOK...

36:23.746 --> 36:25.214
ALL I'M GOING TO SAY IS

36:25.281 --> 36:30.455
FROM EVERY HOLE,
YOU--YOU CLIMB OUT.

36:34.293 --> 36:37.230
THAT GIRL I KNEW
IN HIGH SCHOOL...

36:42.437 --> 36:44.740
THIS ISN'T--
THIS ISN'T YOU, SHARON.

36:47.511 --> 36:49.213
THIS ISN'T YOU.

36:50.548 --> 36:52.317
WE BOTH KNOW THAT.

36:56.456 --> 36:59.360
I STILL CAN'T BELIEVE
HE ALLOWED THE VIDEO.

36:59.427 --> 37:00.361
EXCUSE ME.

37:01.630 --> 37:02.931
WHAT'S THAT ABOUT?

37:02.999 --> 37:04.567
BOBBY'S NOT
TALKING MUCH.

37:04.634 --> 37:06.603
YOU WON, HUH?

37:06.669 --> 37:08.038
62,000.

37:08.105 --> 37:09.207
GOOD RESULT.

37:14.647 --> 37:17.784
LISTEN, UH,
I'M SORRY FOR WHAT
I SAID YESTERDAY.

37:17.852 --> 37:18.886
FORGET ABOUT IT.

37:18.953 --> 37:21.389
NO, UH,
I WAS OUT OF LINE.

37:21.456 --> 37:23.659
YOU SEE THIS?

37:23.726 --> 37:25.128
KEEPSAKE.

37:25.194 --> 37:26.663
I'VE HAD IT 10 YEARS.

37:31.337 --> 37:32.805
"WE ARE PLEASED
TO INFORM YOU

37:32.872 --> 37:35.575
"THAT YOU HAVE
SUCCESSFULLY PASSED
THE BAR EXAMINATION

37:35.643 --> 37:39.147
OF THE COMMONWEALTH
OF MASSACHUSETTS."

37:39.213 --> 37:43.153
YEAH. I REMEMBER
WHEN MY LETTER CAME.

37:43.219 --> 37:44.955
I FAILED MY FIRST 2 TRIES,
YOU KNOW.

37:45.021 --> 37:47.492
NO, I DIDN'T KNOW.

37:47.559 --> 37:48.593
YEAH.

37:48.660 --> 37:52.331
WHEN I FINALLY PASSED,
I CRIED FOR AN HOUR.

37:52.398 --> 37:56.404
I WAS SUDDENLY A LAWYER,
SOMETHING.

37:56.471 --> 37:57.472
HMM.

37:57.538 --> 37:59.441
WHAT I'M TRYING
TO SAY IS

37:59.508 --> 38:02.144
I--I THINK I GOT
SOME KIND OF COMPLEX

38:02.211 --> 38:04.181
THAT I USED TO THINK ENDED
WHEN I GOT THAT LETTER.

38:04.247 --> 38:07.118
ONLY MAYBE IT DIDN'T.

38:07.185 --> 38:11.224
JIMMY, ALL THIS IS
IS A PIECE OF PAPER

38:11.291 --> 38:13.994
THAT GIVES YOU
THE OPPORTUNITY
TO PRACTICE LAW.

38:14.060 --> 38:16.197
I KNOW THIS.

38:18.033 --> 38:19.167
YOU KNOW,
FOR WHAT IT'S WORTH,

38:19.234 --> 38:20.603
LINDSAY MADE
THE SAME MISTAKE.

38:20.669 --> 38:23.507
SHE THOUGHT THERE WAS
SOME AUTOMATIC DIGNITY
IN BEING A LAWYER,

38:23.573 --> 38:24.609
THAT IT CAME
WITH THE DEGREE.

38:24.675 --> 38:26.144
IT DOESN'T.

38:26.211 --> 38:28.514
AND WHEN SHE FIRST
CAME HERE, SHE HATED IT

38:28.580 --> 38:30.216
'CAUSE SHE THOUGHT
THE CASES WE TOOK

38:30.282 --> 38:31.318
WERE A REFLECTION
ON HER,

38:31.384 --> 38:33.554
AND NOW
SHE KNOWS BETTER.

38:33.621 --> 38:36.491
SHE CAN GO IN COURT
AND ARGUE OVER MAGGOTS

38:36.558 --> 38:38.327
AND STILL BE DIGNIFIED
IN DOING IT.

38:38.393 --> 38:41.164
JIMMY, THE CASES
DON'T MAKE YOU.

38:41.231 --> 38:43.234
YOU MAKE YOU.

38:44.902 --> 38:46.504
WHAT'S THE PUNCH LINE?

38:46.571 --> 38:49.208
I NEVER GOT
THE TRUE MEANING OF NOTHING
WITHOUT THE CLIFF NOTES.

38:49.275 --> 38:50.910
YOU GOT TO DECIDE
WHAT YOU REALLY
WANT TO BE.

38:50.977 --> 38:52.379
UH...

38:57.486 --> 38:59.021
FALLEN AND YOU CAN'T
GET UP?

38:59.088 --> 39:00.623
CALL A GRUNT.

39:03.161 --> 39:05.364
IS THAT IT?

39:10.070 --> 39:11.838
SOMEWHERE ALONG THE LINE--

39:11.905 --> 39:12.940
I DON'T EXACTLY KNOW WHEN--

39:13.007 --> 39:16.645
PRAGMATISM BECAME
A GOOD THING
IN THIS COUNTRY.

39:16.712 --> 39:19.849
WE NOW CELEBRATE THE MAN
WHO STARTS OFF WITH
"SEEMS TO ME..."

39:19.916 --> 39:22.420
THEN SPUTTERS OFF
A PIECE OF FOLKSY WISDOM

39:22.487 --> 39:24.355
DROOLING WITH
PRACTICALITY...

39:25.424 --> 39:27.093
AND WE'VE HAD THAT HERE,

39:27.159 --> 39:28.260
HAVEN'T WE?

39:29.229 --> 39:30.664
"IT'S GREAT TO BE TOLERANT.

39:30.731 --> 39:33.134
"WOULD LOVE TO HELP
THE REMARKABLE LITTLE GIRL,

39:33.201 --> 39:35.104
BUT WE HAVE
A SCHOOL TO RUN."

39:35.170 --> 39:37.240
SOUNDS SO DAMN LOGICAL--

39:37.307 --> 39:39.743
IF ONE APPLE
HURTS THE BUNCH,
REMOVE THE APPLE.

39:39.810 --> 39:43.014
THAT'S THE PRACTICAL
AND PRAGMATIC THING TO DO.

39:43.080 --> 39:45.350
ONLY PROBLEM IS

39:45.418 --> 39:49.055
PRAGMATISM, WHERE WE
USED TO SETTLE FOR IT

39:49.123 --> 39:50.891
WHEN IDEALISM
COULDN'T BE ACHIEVED,

39:50.958 --> 39:52.727
IS NOW THE TARGET GOAL,

39:52.794 --> 39:54.863
AND THAT'S LOUSY.

39:58.301 --> 40:00.804
THIS SCHOOL DIDN'T TRY
HARD ENOUGH.

40:00.871 --> 40:03.909
IT JUST MOVED ALONG
IN ITS PRACTICAL,
EFFICIENT WAY,

40:03.976 --> 40:05.978
AND THAT'S NOT GOOD ENOUGH.

40:06.045 --> 40:09.316
MR. GILBERT, YOU GO BACK THERE
AND TRY TO MAKE IT WORK,

40:09.383 --> 40:11.152
AND IF IT DOESN'T,

40:11.218 --> 40:13.188
TRY AGAIN.

40:13.255 --> 40:16.926
THEN TRY AGAIN.

40:16.993 --> 40:19.830
AND IF YOUR SCHOOL STILL
CAN'T ACCOMMODATE THIS GIRL,

40:19.897 --> 40:22.033
THEN MAYBE I'LL HAVE
TO ACCOMMODATE YOU...

40:23.402 --> 40:27.007
BUT FIRST,
I'M GOING TO MAKE ROOM

40:27.074 --> 40:28.909
FOR THE REMOTEST
OF POSSIBILITIES

40:28.976 --> 40:32.281
THAT IT'S YOU THAT
HASN'T GOT IT RIGHT YET.

40:34.083 --> 40:36.352
PLAINTIFF'S
PETITION GRANTED.

40:38.823 --> 40:39.624
THANK YOU.

40:39.691 --> 40:41.359
YOU JUST STUDY HARD,
LISA.

40:43.329 --> 40:44.698
THANK--THANK--THANK--

40:44.764 --> 40:46.366
THANK YOU, REBECCA.
YOU DID IT.

40:46.433 --> 40:48.368
YEAH, WELL, I'M GOOD.

40:50.338 --> 40:51.707
CONGRATULATIONS.
SEE YOU AT SCHOOL.

40:51.728 --> 40:53.028
THANK YOU. OK.

40:53.831 --> 40:54.731
CONGRATULATIONS, LISA.

40:54.797 --> 40:55.664
THANKS.

40:57.864 --> 40:59.331
SORRY.

41:03.897 --> 41:04.831
THANK YOU.

42:20.997 --> 42:22.564
YOU STINKER!
