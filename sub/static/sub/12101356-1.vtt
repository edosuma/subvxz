WEBVTT

01:35.000 --> 01:38.000
Maintain the line!

01:41.000 --> 01:42.000
Hold the line!

01:42.000 --> 01:45.000
The wind is turning!

01:45.000 --> 01:47.000
-We got no escape route!
-We know, get the gear!

01:47.000 --> 01:49.000
Leo, get back here!

01:51.000 --> 01:53.000
-Come on!
-Leo!

01:53.000 --> 01:55.000
Fire's turned!

01:58.000 --> 02:00.000
Fall back!
- Help us, please!

02:23.000 --> 02:25.000
Morning, ma'am.

02:25.000 --> 02:27.000
I'm with the Fire Department,
he's with Florida Gas.

02:27.000 --> 02:30.000
Yeah, our system alerted us
to a gas leak where our main

02:31.000 --> 02:32.000
Is your husband home?

02:32.000 --> 02:34.000
He's in the shower.
Should we get out of the house?

02:34.000 --> 02:38.000
No, this is as likely
a computer error

02:38.000 --> 02:40.000
we should check to be safe.

02:40.000 --> 02:42.000
-May we come in?
-Please, yes.

02:42.000 --> 02:45.000
-Thank you, ma'am.
- Yeah, thank you.

03:02.000 --> 03:05.000
Hey, how far away
is Jacksonville?

03:05.000 --> 03:08.000
With traffic? Six hours.

03:09.000 --> 03:10.000
Maybe more.

03:12.000 --> 03:14.000
You got blood on your shirt.

03:15.000 --> 03:17.000
You should change
before we continue.

03:17.000 --> 03:20.000
Well I'd hate to take a detour.
This'll be on the news

03:20.000 --> 03:22.000
If he has any sense
he'll be on the move

03:22.000 --> 03:26.000
Uh, it'll take him a day
to get the courage,

03:26.000 --> 03:30.000
We'll be there, besides.
We don't take

03:32.000 --> 03:34.000
-I'm sorry.
-Happens.

03:48.000 --> 03:51.000
Come on, bud.
We're gonna be late.

03:51.000 --> 03:53.000
...light winds out

03:53.000 --> 03:56.000
Expect a high
of 74 degrees...

03:56.000 --> 04:00.000
In financial news,
commercial real estate

04:00.000 --> 04:02.000
-What's "obtuse" mean?
-Mmm.

04:02.000 --> 04:05.000
Like, annoyingly insensitive.

04:05.000 --> 04:07.000
Has a girl ever
called  you  obtuse?

04:07.000 --> 04:08.000
Only your mother, son.

04:11.000 --> 04:12.000
Were you?

04:12.000 --> 04:16.000
It could also mean, like,
very slow to understand.

04:17.000 --> 04:19.000
I'm pretty sure I was that.

04:19.000 --> 04:21.000
That makes more sense.

04:21.000 --> 04:24.000
Just tell her you're sorry
and you'll try harder.

04:24.000 --> 04:28.000
I'm not taking dating advice
from you, Dad.

04:28.000 --> 04:30.000
Can girls have cooties
for one more year, please,

04:30.000 --> 04:33.000
while I mentally prepare
for what's coming?

04:33.000 --> 04:35.000
This is the scene

04:35.000 --> 04:38.000
at the home
of District Attorney

04:38.000 --> 04:41.000
where it is now believed
he and his family were killed

04:41.000 --> 04:45.000
in what fire officials
are calling

04:45.000 --> 04:47.000
Fort Lauderdale's
police chief

04:47.000 --> 04:49.000
to work closely
with fire officials

04:49.000 --> 04:53.000
to find a definitive cause
of this tragedy,

04:53.000 --> 04:55.000
that has cost
this community a family

04:55.000 --> 04:57.000
and one of its most
beloved leaders.

05:00.000 --> 05:02.000
Dad, you all right?

05:04.000 --> 05:05.000
We're gonna be late.

05:23.000 --> 05:25.000
-You ready?
-Yep.

05:25.000 --> 05:26.000
Let's go.

05:33.000 --> 05:34.000
Right over there.

05:36.000 --> 05:38.000
Let's go.

05:38.000 --> 05:40.000
Jeez, Dad,
what's wrong with you?

05:47.000 --> 05:48.000
-Dad, what are you doing?
-We're playing hooky.

05:48.000 --> 05:50.000
I don't want to play hooky.
I have a chemistry exam

05:50.000 --> 05:51.000
We're playing hooky!

05:52.000 --> 05:53.000
-

05:56.000 --> 05:58.000
No! No more texting.
No phone, okay?

05:58.000 --> 06:01.000
Just give it to me.
Give... Give me the phone!

06:01.000 --> 06:03.000
Are you in trouble?
What did you do?

06:04.000 --> 06:06.000
The right thing,
you understand me?

06:08.000 --> 06:10.000
I did the right thing.

06:10.000 --> 06:12.000
If you did the right thing,
then why are you so scared?

06:22.000 --> 06:27.000
The great history of
smokejumpers now rests

06:27.000 --> 06:30.000
With every jump you make,
every fire you turn...

06:30.000 --> 06:32.000
Look at those babies.
- Yup.

06:32.000 --> 06:34.000
Hey, top me
off here, boss.

06:34.000 --> 06:36.000
You can't wait 15 minutes
for the party at the bar?

06:36.000 --> 06:38.000
Shut the fuck up, you were
drunk when I picked you up

06:38.000 --> 06:39.000
That's very true.

06:40.000 --> 06:42.000
Self-medicating your
way through it, huh?

06:44.000 --> 06:45.000
Oh, ladies and gentlemen.

06:45.000 --> 06:48.000
Ethan, where do they teach you
that stare that y'all have?

06:48.000 --> 06:49.000
Not that one. That one.
That one, right there.

06:49.000 --> 06:51.000
-That one right here?
- Oh, that one.

06:51.000 --> 06:53.000
-You feel it, Benny?
-I can see it right through

06:53.000 --> 06:54.000
Going right into
my heart, my soul.

06:54.000 --> 06:56.000
Just a lot of hours
in front of the mirror, bud.

06:56.000 --> 06:59.000
Oh, I bet. Mean and sexy.

06:59.000 --> 07:01.000
Why'd they put you
in a fire tower?

07:02.000 --> 07:03.000
Well, I'm just lucky, I guess.

07:03.000 --> 07:06.000
-Yeah, fuck them
and their tests.

07:06.000 --> 07:07.000
Fuck them.

07:07.000 --> 07:10.000
-Fuck 'em all.
-Which tower?

07:10.000 --> 07:12.000
217, close to you.

07:12.000 --> 07:15.000
So keep the barbecues low,
or I'm gonna have to send

07:15.000 --> 07:17.000
Right. All right, listen.

07:17.000 --> 07:19.000
I'd really like today
to go different

07:19.000 --> 07:21.000
and the year before that
and every other fucking

07:21.000 --> 07:23.000
-Last year was fun.
-All right.

07:23.000 --> 07:26.000
So, who can tell me
what the goal of the day is?

07:26.000 --> 07:28.000
Threesome sounds
pretty good.

07:28.000 --> 07:29.000
Or winning the lottery.

07:29.000 --> 07:31.000
Threesome for you
would  be winning the lottery.

07:31.000 --> 07:32.000
-That's fucked up.
-Very true.

07:32.000 --> 07:34.000
The goal,
you fucking clowns,

07:34.000 --> 07:36.000
-No fighting.
- Exactly right.

07:36.000 --> 07:38.000
And please do not
jump off of shit

07:38.000 --> 07:41.000
-Oh, who would do that?
-Oh, I have no idea.

07:41.000 --> 07:44.000
I... am older now,
and...

07:45.000 --> 07:46.000
Well, I'm older.

07:46.000 --> 07:48.000
-Just trying to keep you alive.
-Hey, no, no, hey, hey.

07:48.000 --> 07:50.000
Don't you worry about that.
That's our job.

07:50.000 --> 07:53.000
You just write
the parking tickets

07:53.000 --> 07:54.000
Fair enough.

07:54.000 --> 07:57.000
-Make good choices, please.
-Oh, here's to good choices.

07:57.000 --> 07:59.000
Good choices!
- Now we're talking.

07:59.000 --> 08:01.000
I'm feeling naughty.

08:01.000 --> 08:03.000
Well, me being
the team player...

08:03.000 --> 08:05.000
-I guess I can
help you with that.

08:05.000 --> 08:07.000
I do not have sex with a man
I have seen shit in the woods.

08:07.000 --> 08:10.000
Get the fuck out of here.
I have the very same rule.

08:10.000 --> 08:12.000
You don't have sex with men
who shit in the woods?

08:12.000 --> 08:15.000
-Who the fuck are you kidding?
- Oh, are we

08:15.000 --> 08:17.000
Are we too loud, Ethan?
I'm sorry. I'm so--

08:17.000 --> 08:20.000
-How about this?
Congratulations!

08:20.000 --> 08:23.000
Congratulations!

08:32.000 --> 08:33.000
Come on now.

08:33.000 --> 08:35.000
Would you
just get into this?

08:35.000 --> 08:36.000
Could you just get
your head in the game?

08:36.000 --> 08:38.000
Hey, do you want to
dance with the devil?

08:38.000 --> 08:40.000
I'm gonna show you how to
dance with the devil right now,

08:40.000 --> 08:43.000
-Ooh!
-Listen, the objective

08:43.000 --> 08:45.000
That's what she said.
-I'm gonna show you

08:45.000 --> 08:48.000
Boss...
you're up, let's go.

08:48.000 --> 08:50.000
I do nothing involving
the word "corn."

08:51.000 --> 08:52.000
Oh, you coward.

08:58.000 --> 08:59.000
Yes!

09:00.000 --> 09:01.000
See? That's how it's done.

09:01.000 --> 09:03.000
-Nothing left to prove.
- How can I follow that?

09:03.000 --> 09:05.000
Give me that.
This is how you follow it.

09:05.000 --> 09:09.000
Yeah! Yeah!

09:09.000 --> 09:12.000
I'm not judging.
I'm just trying to understand.

09:13.000 --> 09:15.000
That's your
fucking boyfriend?

09:15.000 --> 09:16.000
-Yes.
-

09:18.000 --> 09:20.000
I can't get my fucking
head around it.

09:20.000 --> 09:21.000
I don't understand,
why is it so funny to you?

09:22.000 --> 09:24.000
Oh, fuck,
dude this is perfect!

09:24.000 --> 09:27.000
He's trying to quit smoking.
Stop being a fucking dick.

09:27.000 --> 09:30.000
-Vic! Ryan!
She's... She's doing it!

09:30.000 --> 09:31.000
She's fucking doing it,
come on!

09:31.000 --> 09:33.000
-Parachute!
-Come on!

09:36.000 --> 09:38.000
You've learned nothing!

09:39.000 --> 09:41.000
-Oh, fuck!
-Let's go!

09:43.000 --> 09:46.000
things I lost

10:02.000 --> 10:04.000
Oh, fuck.

10:09.000 --> 10:10.000
Shit.

10:10.000 --> 10:13.000
I remember the landing
being softer last time.

10:13.000 --> 10:15.000
Nope. It went
pretty much like that.

10:27.000 --> 10:29.000
What are you gonna do,
arrest me?

10:29.000 --> 10:30.000
Huh?

10:31.000 --> 10:32.000
Fuck.

10:32.000 --> 10:34.000
You wonder why
you failed your

10:34.000 --> 10:36.000
Did you tighten these
with a fucking torque wrench?

10:36.000 --> 10:38.000
Oh, does it hurt?

10:38.000 --> 10:42.000
-Yeah, it fucking hurts.
-Good. Maybe you'll

10:42.000 --> 10:44.000
Hey, eyes on me.
Quit your sulking, all right?

10:44.000 --> 10:46.000
You got yourself here.
This shit is on you.

10:46.000 --> 10:48.000
Fucking earned it.

10:57.000 --> 10:59.000
Let's go.

11:02.000 --> 11:03.000
Here's the thing.

11:03.000 --> 11:06.000
We both know
that had nothing

11:06.000 --> 11:08.000
and it sure as shit wasn't
an accident, all right?

11:08.000 --> 11:13.000
Look, H.,
I know what

11:13.000 --> 11:16.000
Maybe those other assholes,
they don't see it,

11:20.000 --> 11:23.000
You know,
maybe a summer in a fire tower

11:23.000 --> 11:25.000
-Maybe.
-Mm-hmmm.

11:25.000 --> 11:27.000
Maybe I'll just jump.

11:34.000 --> 11:36.000
Jesus Christ.

12:16.000 --> 12:17.000
It doesn't look like
they took anything.

12:18.000 --> 12:20.000
Toothbrushes still
in the bathroom.

12:36.000 --> 12:38.000
They're gone.

12:38.000 --> 12:40.000
We need a destination.
I'll take the computer,

13:05.000 --> 13:08.000
He withdrew $10,000
from his account.

13:08.000 --> 13:11.000
We need to know the friend
or family member

13:11.000 --> 13:12.000
All right.

13:14.000 --> 13:16.000
Come on.

13:18.000 --> 13:20.000
Where are you going?

13:39.000 --> 13:42.000
Uh... How about the one
in law enforcement?

13:46.000 --> 13:48.000
Survival school.

13:48.000 --> 13:50.000
This keeps getting better.

14:03.000 --> 14:06.000
What do you know

14:06.000 --> 14:07.000
-You're an accountant.
-Yeah.

14:07.000 --> 14:09.000
At least I thought you were.

14:09.000 --> 14:12.000
I'm a forensic accountant,
which means...

14:12.000 --> 14:14.000
I look for things
that don't add up.

14:15.000 --> 14:18.000
And I found some.

14:18.000 --> 14:23.000
The man I work for,
he was killed today

14:23.000 --> 14:25.000
But I still know it,
which means they're gonna...

14:25.000 --> 14:27.000
They're gonna
come after me, too.

14:27.000 --> 14:29.000
-We need to go to the police.
-No.

14:29.000 --> 14:32.000
The DA has police protection
24 hours a day.

14:32.000 --> 14:34.000
And where were they
this morning?

14:34.000 --> 14:38.000
The case implicates
a lot of people, son,

14:38.000 --> 14:42.000
Governors, congressmen...
We can only trust

14:43.000 --> 14:45.000
You understand me?

14:47.000 --> 14:49.000
Yeah.

15:11.000 --> 15:13.000
-Hey, baby.
-Hey, you.

15:14.000 --> 15:16.000
-How's the bun?
-Cooking.

15:17.000 --> 15:18.000
Just, come here.

15:20.000 --> 15:22.000
Good to see you.

15:24.000 --> 15:27.000
-Mmm. How was your day?
-Oh, same old.

15:27.000 --> 15:28.000
Really?
-Mm-hmm.

15:28.000 --> 15:32.000
I heard
you had a little run-in

15:32.000 --> 15:36.000
Well, she's just letting her
demons run the show,

15:36.000 --> 15:38.000
You weren't too hard
on her, were you?

15:38.000 --> 15:39.000
Maybe I was
a little hard on her.

15:39.000 --> 15:42.000
But you know something,
she's an asshole.

15:42.000 --> 15:43.000
She deserves it.

15:43.000 --> 15:45.000
She's plenty hard on herself

15:45.000 --> 15:47.000
and she probably doesn't
need any help from you.

15:47.000 --> 15:51.000
Nothing like arguing
with my wife about how I spoke

15:51.000 --> 15:53.000
Especially when
my wife takes her side.

15:53.000 --> 15:55.000
I'm not taking her side,
I'm just not taking yours.

15:55.000 --> 15:57.000
You are taking her side,
because I don't even

15:57.000 --> 15:59.000
Then you're on her side.

16:00.000 --> 16:02.000
What is that,
like an accusation?

16:04.000 --> 16:06.000
-Baby, are we fighting?
-

16:06.000 --> 16:08.000
God, men are simple.

16:08.000 --> 16:10.000
We're not fighting, babe.
Dinner's on the stove.

16:10.000 --> 16:14.000
There's beer in the fridge.
All's right with the world.

16:17.000 --> 16:19.000
Oh, did you feel that one?

16:19.000 --> 16:23.000
-Uh-uh. No.
-Oh, my God, how did you

16:23.000 --> 16:24.000
I just didn't, baby.

16:24.000 --> 16:26.000
-I think I know what it is.
-Hmm? What is it?

16:26.000 --> 16:28.000
I think it's that
concrete skull of yours.

16:28.000 --> 16:31.000
I love how somehow
it's my fault that I don't feel

16:31.000 --> 16:33.000
Oh, babe,
everything's your fault.

16:33.000 --> 16:35.000
-Everything is my--
-The baby is your fault.

16:35.000 --> 16:39.000
See, scientifically speaking,
it's 50% my fault,

16:39.000 --> 16:41.000
-Is that what you think?
-That's what I think.

16:41.000 --> 16:43.000
-You know what I think?
-Oh, no, you're gonna

16:43.000 --> 16:44.000
-Uh-huh.
-Oh, no!

16:44.000 --> 16:49.000
I think that
everything is your fault

16:49.000 --> 16:53.000
-We clear?
-Ah! We're so clear, baby.

16:53.000 --> 16:55.000
We're so clear. Mmm.

16:56.000 --> 16:58.000
-

17:01.000 --> 17:03.000
Ah!

17:03.000 --> 17:04.000
Hello?

17:04.000 --> 17:06.000
-Allison. It's Owen.
-  Owen!

17:06.000 --> 17:10.000
Hey. Could I talk to Ethan?

17:10.000 --> 17:14.000
-Um, I got a real problem.
-  Okay.

17:20.000 --> 17:21.000
Owen, how you doing, man?

17:21.000 --> 17:25.000
Hey, Ethan. Um...
I've been better.

17:26.000 --> 17:27.000
What's going on?

19:20.000 --> 19:23.000
-Hi, buddy.
- Hey.

19:24.000 --> 19:26.000
What are you writing?

19:27.000 --> 19:28.000
It's for you.

19:29.000 --> 19:31.000
It's all my secrets.

19:33.000 --> 19:38.000
But I don't
want you to read it...

19:40.000 --> 19:42.000
Promise?

19:42.000 --> 19:44.000
What am I supposed to
do with it?

19:55.000 --> 19:58.000
Give it to
someone you trust.

19:59.000 --> 20:00.000
When?

20:01.000 --> 20:03.000
With a little luck, never.

20:07.000 --> 20:09.000
I'm really sorry
about this, son.

20:12.000 --> 20:13.000
You did the right thing.

20:14.000 --> 20:16.000
Right?

20:17.000 --> 20:18.000
Yeah.

20:20.000 --> 20:21.000
I'm still sorry.

20:46.000 --> 20:47.000
That's it. Thanks.

20:47.000 --> 20:49.000
-All good?
-Yeah, good.

20:51.000 --> 20:53.000
Wasn't sure what you needed,
so I brought options.

20:53.000 --> 20:55.000
-Yeah, we'll take the truck.
-Roger that.

21:12.000 --> 21:16.000
It's a lot to swallow, Ethan.
How well do you know this guy?

21:16.000 --> 21:20.000
He was married to my sister.
The kid, he's...

21:20.000 --> 21:22.000
Top you off?
-Yeah.

21:22.000 --> 21:26.000
-Would you like some?
-I'm okay, sweetheart.

21:26.000 --> 21:27.000
Sure you don't want
a piece of this steak?

21:27.000 --> 21:29.000
You know I don't
eat that crap.

21:29.000 --> 21:30.000
-Yeah.
-That shit right there

21:31.000 --> 21:33.000
I think I rode this
ol' bull back in the '70s.

21:33.000 --> 21:35.000
I don't blame you for
not eating this meat.

21:37.000 --> 21:39.000
I don't know
what you want me

21:39.000 --> 21:43.000
Well, I'm not sure
what I want

21:43.000 --> 21:44.000
If he's telling the truth,

21:44.000 --> 21:47.000
he needs the Marshal Service,
or the FBI.

21:47.000 --> 21:49.000
I said the same, but...

21:49.000 --> 21:53.000
Like, he wanted me
to call a TV station,

21:53.000 --> 21:56.000
Don't be calling
no goddamn TV station.

21:56.000 --> 21:59.000
-We're not trying
to invent a story here.

21:59.000 --> 22:00.000
You let me know as soon
as he gets to your house.

22:01.000 --> 22:03.000
-I want to see
this guy in person.

22:05.000 --> 22:07.000
We're done.

22:07.000 --> 22:11.000
-Go, uh... stop crime.
-I'll do my best.

22:11.000 --> 22:15.000
You know, you should...
maybe consider a salad.

22:17.000 --> 22:19.000
-Who eats salad for breakfast?
- Fair enough.

22:19.000 --> 22:21.000
-Sheriff?

22:21.000 --> 22:23.000
Your wife's calling.
Do you want to take the call?

22:24.000 --> 22:26.000
Absolutely not.

23:28.000 --> 23:30.000
Connor!

23:37.000 --> 23:39.000
Hey, Connor!

23:41.000 --> 23:43.000
Back away from it.

23:44.000 --> 23:46.000
It's okay, Dad.

23:47.000 --> 23:49.000
He's nice.

23:53.000 --> 23:55.000
We gotta go, come on.

24:00.000 --> 24:02.000
Connor.

24:37.000 --> 24:40.000
Lynx lookout, copy?

24:40.000 --> 24:42.000
Copy, Lynx.

24:42.000 --> 24:45.000
I see thunderclouds
and 30-mile-an-hour wind.

24:45.000 --> 24:48.000
Is there any precipitation
in that storm?

24:48.000 --> 24:51.000
Lynx, keep this frequency clear
unless you see smoke.

24:51.000 --> 24:53.000
This ain't a party line.

24:56.000 --> 24:58.000
Copy.

24:58.000 --> 24:59.000
Jackass.

25:14.000 --> 25:17.000
Hold the line!

25:17.000 --> 25:19.000
Shit! The wind is turning!

25:19.000 --> 25:20.000
That was our exit route!

25:21.000 --> 25:22.000
They got the wind wrong!

25:22.000 --> 25:24.000
We're fucking trapped!

25:24.000 --> 25:25.000
Hannah!
What the fuck are we doing?

25:25.000 --> 25:26.000
-Deploy! Deploy!
- Deploy!

25:26.000 --> 25:28.000
Get the gear!

25:28.000 --> 25:30.000
No, no, no, I ain't cooking

25:30.000 --> 25:31.000
Leo! Leo, get back here!

25:33.000 --> 25:34.000
Leo! Watch out!

25:36.000 --> 25:38.000
Hannah!
Get in your shelter,

25:38.000 --> 25:43.000
Help us, please!
- Hey, help me, please!

25:43.000 --> 25:45.000
-Hannah, they're gone.
- Help! Help me, please!

25:45.000 --> 25:47.000
-They're gone!
-

25:56.000 --> 25:59.000
Fire tower
217 Lynx, this is base.

26:10.000 --> 26:12.000
This isn't a party line.

26:13.000 --> 26:15.000
Or so I'm told.

26:16.000 --> 26:19.000
Fuck that little prick.
He rides a scooter

26:19.000 --> 26:21.000
How you holding up?

26:23.000 --> 26:27.000
I'm in a 20-by-20 box
on stilts

26:30.000 --> 26:32.000
I have to get out of here.

26:32.000 --> 26:34.000
I'll call you
on the sat phone.

26:39.000 --> 26:42.000
-Hey.
-  You somewhere better?

26:43.000 --> 26:46.000
Define "better."

26:46.000 --> 26:49.000
Giving you
a psych eval three days

26:50.000 --> 26:51.000
None of us could have passed.

26:52.000 --> 26:55.000
Forest Service
looking for someone to blame

26:59.000 --> 27:01.000
I read the wind wrong.

27:01.000 --> 27:05.000
They read it wrong,
then told you wrong.

27:05.000 --> 27:07.000
Not your fault.

27:10.000 --> 27:11.000
What choice did you have?

27:18.000 --> 27:22.000
I should have gone to them,
and instead

27:23.000 --> 27:25.000
Then you'd be dead, too.

27:27.000 --> 27:30.000
Well... that's our job.

27:34.000 --> 27:36.000
Do you think about it?

27:36.000 --> 27:38.000
Every day.

27:38.000 --> 27:41.000
Listen, don't do
anything stupid.

27:41.000 --> 27:43.000
There's a lot of people
who care about you.

27:43.000 --> 27:48.000
-Yeah.
-  Come on, there's me,

27:48.000 --> 27:49.000
There's me.

27:54.000 --> 27:57.000
Hey, you see that storm cell
12 o'clock to the tower?

27:58.000 --> 28:01.000
-You see that on the Doppler?
-  Yeah, it should bank north.

28:03.000 --> 28:05.000
No, it's not banking north.

28:25.000 --> 28:32.000
Can you imagine what
Lewis and Clark must have

28:32.000 --> 28:34.000
Do you think
they came this way?

28:34.000 --> 28:38.000
Right this way.
This is the Lewis

28:38.000 --> 28:41.000
All we did was pave it.

28:45.000 --> 28:46.000
I like it out here.

28:47.000 --> 28:50.000
I like the space of it.

29:17.000 --> 29:18.000
That's a good spot.

29:19.000 --> 29:21.000
You'll have line of sight.

29:22.000 --> 29:24.000
Time since we last saw a car?

29:25.000 --> 29:27.000
It's six minutes.

29:27.000 --> 29:30.000
-It's a pretty good window.
-We do it here.

29:57.000 --> 29:59.000
Veer off, you bastard.

30:01.000 --> 30:02.000
Fuck me.

30:22.000 --> 30:24.000
Vehicle approaching,
two klicks out.

30:24.000 --> 30:27.000
Driver is female,
Montana plates.

30:27.000 --> 30:31.000
Alfa, echo, kilo,
five, five niner.

30:31.000 --> 30:36.000
Registered to
a Deborah Killdeer

30:57.000 --> 30:58.000
Motherfucker.

31:25.000 --> 31:28.000
-Are you gonna help?
-Absolutely not.

31:32.000 --> 31:33.000
-Duck!
-

31:44.000 --> 31:45.000
Ah!

32:04.000 --> 32:07.000
There's a fallen tree,
right there to the right.

32:07.000 --> 32:10.000
Don't make a sound, okay?
No matter what you see.

32:10.000 --> 32:14.000
Creeks lead to rivers,
rivers lead to towns.

32:17.000 --> 32:20.000
You call the news,
you call the TV station.

32:20.000 --> 32:22.000
You give them this.

32:23.000 --> 32:25.000
I want to stay with you.

32:25.000 --> 32:27.000
I love you, son.

32:29.000 --> 32:31.000
Go! Go.

33:00.000 --> 33:04.000
-You all right?
-Yeah.

33:04.000 --> 33:05.000
Didn't see that coming.

33:11.000 --> 33:14.000
-There's movement.
-Will this fucker ever die?

33:58.000 --> 34:00.000
-We're blown.
-Fuck.

34:06.000 --> 34:08.000
Are you okay?
Did somebody go over the edge?

34:08.000 --> 34:09.000
No, ma'am, it's okay.
Everything's fine.

34:52.000 --> 34:55.000
Hey, sweetheart,
did they, uh...

34:55.000 --> 34:57.000
No, not yet.
-Huh.

34:57.000 --> 34:58.000
Are you almost home?

34:58.000 --> 35:00.000
Yeah, I'm like
five minutes out.

35:11.000 --> 35:13.000
-Babe, let me call you back.
-Sure, okay. Bye, babe.

35:59.000 --> 36:00.000
Shit.
We left that scene a mess.

36:00.000 --> 36:02.000
Oh, you want to clean it up?

36:02.000 --> 36:03.000
It is what it is.
This job needed two teams.

36:03.000 --> 36:06.000
Fucking two teams,
like I told 'em.

36:06.000 --> 36:08.000
Fascinating where they
decide to save money.

36:08.000 --> 36:10.000
All units, code three.

36:11.000 --> 36:13.000
-That was fast.
-That's the consequence

36:13.000 --> 36:15.000
Two deceased,
one white male, mid-40s,

36:15.000 --> 36:17.000
-  one white female, early 30s.
-There's no boy.

36:17.000 --> 36:20.000
You think they're looking down
from the street,

36:20.000 --> 36:22.000
Yes, sir. Where?

36:24.000 --> 36:25.000
Yeah, we're en route.

36:26.000 --> 36:28.000
En route where?

36:28.000 --> 36:29.000
He wants to meet.

36:29.000 --> 36:32.000
What, he's here?
Why is he here?

36:32.000 --> 36:35.000
He's... Fuck! Fuck!

36:57.000 --> 37:00.000
Please! Help us!

37:29.000 --> 37:30.000
Hey, wait!

37:32.000 --> 37:33.000
Hey!

37:36.000 --> 37:38.000
Stop!

37:41.000 --> 37:42.000
Come here.

37:42.000 --> 37:44.000
I'm not gonna hurt you.

37:47.000 --> 37:50.000
Stop! Stop!
I'm not gonna hurt you.

37:50.000 --> 37:52.000
I want to see where
the blood's coming from.

37:52.000 --> 37:53.000
It's not my blood.

37:55.000 --> 37:56.000
Whose blood is it?

37:59.000 --> 38:01.000
All right, listen.

38:01.000 --> 38:04.000
My name is Hannah.
What's yours?

38:04.000 --> 38:07.000
-Fuck you.
-Oh, nice.

38:07.000 --> 38:08.000
I'm a firefighter.

38:08.000 --> 38:12.000
I work with
the Forest Service,

38:13.000 --> 38:14.000
All right?

38:15.000 --> 38:17.000
Talk to me and I'm
gonna help you, okay?

38:18.000 --> 38:20.000
All right.

38:20.000 --> 38:22.000
Good luck!

38:22.000 --> 38:24.000
Good luck.

38:24.000 --> 38:27.000
Town is 12 miles that way...

38:27.000 --> 38:28.000
over the Continental Divide.

38:29.000 --> 38:30.000
Have fun with that.

38:34.000 --> 38:35.000
Wait!

38:40.000 --> 38:41.000
Yeah?

38:47.000 --> 38:50.000
I have a radio in a tower...
over there.

38:52.000 --> 38:56.000
-We can call the sheriff or--
-No, not the sheriff, the news.

38:57.000 --> 38:58.000
Can you call the news?

39:02.000 --> 39:05.000
Yeah. Sure, I...
I can call whoever

39:16.000 --> 39:17.000
You're fucking fast.

39:18.000 --> 39:19.000
Man!

39:31.000 --> 39:35.000
-Want me to drop you closer?
-He doesn't want us any closer.

39:35.000 --> 39:37.000
Okay.

39:37.000 --> 39:39.000
Pull around the front.
I'll meet you there

40:14.000 --> 40:17.000
-What's with the limp?
-It's nothing.

40:20.000 --> 40:22.000
You missed the boy.

40:23.000 --> 40:24.000
That seems unlikely.

40:25.000 --> 40:27.000
Hmm.

40:27.000 --> 40:30.000
We promise absolutes,
and "unlikely"

40:33.000 --> 40:35.000
The man was resourceful enough
to make it all the way here,

40:35.000 --> 40:39.000
so assume
he was resourceful enough

40:39.000 --> 40:42.000
of everything we retrieved
from the DA's office.

40:42.000 --> 40:46.000
And assume
that those duplicates are

40:49.000 --> 40:51.000
Assume the worst
case scenario.

40:53.000 --> 40:55.000
Assume catastrophe and...

40:56.000 --> 40:58.000
act accordingly.

40:58.000 --> 40:59.000
It's a lot of risk.

40:59.000 --> 41:01.000
That, I am aware of.

41:01.000 --> 41:05.000
You have, what,
maybe six hours

41:05.000 --> 41:07.000
I can buy us more time.

41:07.000 --> 41:09.000
But they have to
have the stomach for it.

41:11.000 --> 41:14.000
I will make them
have the stomach for it.

41:15.000 --> 41:17.000
Should have been
two teams.

41:17.000 --> 41:19.000
Hit 'em
at the same time.

41:19.000 --> 41:21.000
What got us here
doesn't really matter,

41:21.000 --> 41:23.000
-No, it doesn't.
-No, it doesn't.

41:25.000 --> 41:29.000
It's a zero-sum game.
Treat it that way.

42:27.000 --> 42:29.000
-Are we going to the station?
-Brother-in-law...

42:31.000 --> 42:33.000
I think.

42:33.000 --> 42:35.000
Maybe we get lucky.

42:35.000 --> 42:37.000
This is a lot of risk
for a boy.

42:37.000 --> 42:40.000
Well, they're worried
about what he might know.

42:41.000 --> 42:43.000
And what he saw us do.

42:45.000 --> 42:50.000
From this point forward,
we put down anyone

42:50.000 --> 42:55.000
That's gonna bring a lot
of attention to this town.

42:55.000 --> 42:58.000
Give 'em something else
to worry about.

43:17.000 --> 43:19.000
Let 'em focus on this
for a while.

44:07.000 --> 44:09.000
Yep.

44:17.000 --> 44:19.000
Allie, there's
no sign of Connor.

44:19.000 --> 44:20.000
Well, are they looking?

44:20.000 --> 44:23.000
Yeah, they're gonna set up
a search crew, but...

44:28.000 --> 44:31.000
Ethan?
Ethan, are you still there?

44:51.000 --> 44:52.000
Oh, God.

45:03.000 --> 45:05.000
Let's get you warm.

45:16.000 --> 45:17.000
You hungry?

45:19.000 --> 45:20.000
No.

45:20.000 --> 45:22.000
Well, you should eat anyway.

45:24.000 --> 45:26.000
Here. Here's some...

45:27.000 --> 45:29.000
Candy and shit in it. Here.

45:35.000 --> 45:37.000
So, here's the deal, buddy.

45:37.000 --> 45:41.000
The tower
was hit by lightning.

45:41.000 --> 45:43.000
So we can't...

45:43.000 --> 45:44.000
Fucker.

45:46.000 --> 45:49.000
So we can't
call the sheriff, or...

45:49.000 --> 45:51.000
fuck me... anybody.

45:52.000 --> 45:54.000
We are gonna have to
hike to town.

46:01.000 --> 46:05.000
So I need to know whether
we should do that tonight,

46:05.000 --> 46:07.000
or if we can wait
till morning.

46:09.000 --> 46:10.000
Are you in trouble?

46:13.000 --> 46:16.000
-Yeah.
-Yeah?

46:16.000 --> 46:20.000
Anyone else in trouble?
Anyone we need

46:24.000 --> 46:26.000
Not anymore.

46:41.000 --> 46:43.000
All right.

46:45.000 --> 46:47.000
Well...

46:47.000 --> 46:50.000
You don't seem
much up for a hike.

46:54.000 --> 46:57.000
My dad said if anything
happened to him,

46:57.000 --> 46:59.000
I should find someone
I can trust.

47:11.000 --> 47:13.000
Something happen
to your dad?

47:16.000 --> 47:18.000
Are you someone
I can trust?

47:29.000 --> 47:32.000
I'm absolutely
someone you can trust.

48:13.000 --> 48:14.000
Where'd they find him?

48:15.000 --> 48:17.000
On the road.

48:18.000 --> 48:19.000
I hid under a tree.

48:20.000 --> 48:22.000
And ran down to the creek.

48:22.000 --> 48:26.000
'Cause creeks lead to rivers,
and rivers lead to towns.

48:27.000 --> 48:29.000
That they do.

48:30.000 --> 48:32.000
All right. Okay.

48:36.000 --> 48:40.000
-Are we leaving tonight?
-We're leaving right now.

48:46.000 --> 48:48.000
The fire has now jumped

48:48.000 --> 48:50.000
and is moving
toward Highway 12.

48:51.000 --> 48:54.000
Winds are north-northwest
at seven miles per hour.

48:54.000 --> 48:56.000
We are currently at
zero percent containment...

48:57.000 --> 48:59.000
Babe, I have been calling--

49:01.000 --> 49:04.000
-Can I help you?
-I'm Agent Freers,

49:04.000 --> 49:07.000
Were with the FBI.
Is Deputy Sawyer here?

49:07.000 --> 49:09.000
He's still on duty.
You can try him on your radio.

49:09.000 --> 49:12.000
-We run different frequencies.
-Change the channel.

49:12.000 --> 49:14.000
We spoke earlier
and he asked us

49:14.000 --> 49:15.000
Do you mind if we come in?

49:17.000 --> 49:18.000
Yes, I do.

49:26.000 --> 49:28.000
Show me your hands.

49:48.000 --> 49:49.000
House is clear.

49:52.000 --> 49:54.000
I think she's pregnant.

50:01.000 --> 50:02.000
You pregnant?

50:05.000 --> 50:08.000
-How many months?
-Six.

50:10.000 --> 50:11.000
Boy or girl?

50:12.000 --> 50:14.000
Girl.

50:14.000 --> 50:18.000
Well, I want you to think
about her when I ask you

50:20.000 --> 50:23.000
You run a survival school?

50:25.000 --> 50:28.000
Telling me the truth
is how you survive.

50:32.000 --> 50:34.000
-Is the boy here?
-No.

50:34.000 --> 50:36.000
-Has he been here?
-No.

50:36.000 --> 50:38.000
-Have the police found him?
-Not that I know of

50:38.000 --> 50:42.000
-But this is where he'll come?
-I don't know.

50:45.000 --> 50:50.000
Now, that sounds like
you're telling us the truth,

50:51.000 --> 50:53.000
we have to know.

50:55.000 --> 50:57.000
I am telling the truth.

51:01.000 --> 51:02.000
I have to know.

51:06.000 --> 51:08.000
I am telling the truth!

51:10.000 --> 51:12.000
I have to know.

51:12.000 --> 51:14.000
I'm telling the truth.

51:14.000 --> 51:16.000
Okay, my husband found him!
My husband found him!

51:16.000 --> 51:18.000
-He's with my husband!
-Where'd he take him?

51:18.000 --> 51:20.000
I don't know,
he didn't tell me!

51:20.000 --> 51:23.000
-I can call him!
- Okay.

51:24.000 --> 51:26.000
Call him.

51:35.000 --> 51:36.000
Where's the phone?

51:42.000 --> 51:44.000
You keep this
conversation casual.

51:45.000 --> 51:47.000
You hear me?

51:52.000 --> 51:54.000
Okay.

51:57.000 --> 52:00.000
Hey, baby,
I'm dealing with this fire.

52:00.000 --> 52:04.000
Hey, babe, how's the...
how's the boy?

52:04.000 --> 52:06.000
-  What?
-Is he hungry?

52:06.000 --> 52:08.000
I bet he's hungry.
I'll make him something to eat

52:08.000 --> 52:11.000
That's a distress word.
You gave him a fucking

52:13.000 --> 52:15.000
You fucking survivalists!

52:15.000 --> 52:17.000
You wanna survive?
I'll give you something

52:20.000 --> 52:24.000
-You're pointing
that the wrong way.

52:53.000 --> 52:56.000
-You good?
-No, I'm fucking not.

52:56.000 --> 52:57.000
Fuck!

52:57.000 --> 53:00.000
I'm a mother pheasant plucker,

53:00.000 --> 53:02.000
I'm the most pleasant
mother pheasant plucker to

53:02.000 --> 53:06.000
I'm a pheasant mother plucker,
I pluck mother pheasants.

53:06.000 --> 53:08.000
-I'm the most pleasant
mother pheasant...

53:09.000 --> 53:11.000
Ooh!
- The most

53:13.000 --> 53:15.000
All right, break's over.

53:15.000 --> 53:16.000
Okay, we gotta get downhill.

53:17.000 --> 53:19.000
We're gonna take turns running.
When I say "stop," you stop.

53:19.000 --> 53:20.000
You get down like this,
and I'm gonna run past you.

53:21.000 --> 53:23.000
We're gonna keep switching.
Okay, ready? Go, run!

53:26.000 --> 53:27.000
Down!

53:32.000 --> 53:33.000
Run!

53:35.000 --> 53:37.000
Down!

53:39.000 --> 53:40.000
Run!

53:56.000 --> 53:58.000
No, no.

53:58.000 --> 54:00.000
Please, please.

54:04.000 --> 54:06.000
You got hit.

54:06.000 --> 54:08.000
Missed me.

54:10.000 --> 54:12.000
You got hit.

54:13.000 --> 54:15.000
No, buddy, it missed me.

54:19.000 --> 54:21.000
We gotta go.

54:21.000 --> 54:23.000
He died right in front of me.

54:40.000 --> 54:43.000
Let it out, buddy.
Let it out.

54:52.000 --> 54:54.000
There's no blood trail.

54:54.000 --> 54:58.000
-You think we got her?
-It's 50-50,

54:58.000 --> 55:00.000
Ah, fuck.

55:00.000 --> 55:04.000
-You okay? Don't look good.
-Well, there's nothing

55:08.000 --> 55:09.000
Go deep.

55:16.000 --> 55:17.000
Allie?

55:19.000 --> 55:23.000
Dispatch, this is Alpha One.
We need two more guys.

55:23.000 --> 55:25.000
-

55:28.000 --> 55:30.000
Drop your weapon!
Drop it! Drop it now!

55:30.000 --> 55:32.000
Drop it right fucking now!

55:32.000 --> 55:36.000
Drop your fucking weapon!
Step in the road.

55:38.000 --> 55:41.000
Stop. Face away from me.

55:41.000 --> 55:44.000
You're about to be a father.
That's the only thought

55:44.000 --> 55:47.000
Now, very slowly,
unbuckle your service belt,

55:47.000 --> 55:49.000
drop it to the ground,
toss it to the left.

55:55.000 --> 55:56.000
Drop to your knees.

55:59.000 --> 56:01.000
Allow yourself
to fall forward.

56:02.000 --> 56:03.000
Fall forward.

56:06.000 --> 56:08.000
Hands behind your back.

56:09.000 --> 56:11.000
-Backup weapon?
-Right ankle.

56:14.000 --> 56:15.000
We have another man
with your wife.

56:15.000 --> 56:17.000
On my word,
she will be executed.

56:17.000 --> 56:18.000
You will not be
a father anymore.

56:18.000 --> 56:20.000
-Do you understand?
-I understand.

56:20.000 --> 56:23.000
According to your wife,
the boy's with you.

56:23.000 --> 56:25.000
Now, if that were true,
there'd be a much bigger

56:25.000 --> 56:26.000
police presence
in your yard right now.

56:26.000 --> 56:28.000
The boy hasn't been found.

56:28.000 --> 56:32.000
We think he was tossed
from the vehicle in the crash.

56:32.000 --> 56:34.000
There's a search crew who was
gonna go out in the morning,

56:34.000 --> 56:37.000
but that got called off
because of the fire.

56:37.000 --> 56:40.000
Search is exactly what
you and I are going to do.

56:41.000 --> 56:43.000
Jack...

56:43.000 --> 56:45.000
You really think we should
leave that loose end?

56:45.000 --> 56:48.000
Clock is ticking.
We don't have time

56:49.000 --> 56:50.000
Okay, let's go.

56:50.000 --> 56:51.000
Up.

56:57.000 --> 57:00.000
A few years from now,
you are gonna find yourself

57:00.000 --> 57:03.000
or a forest behind your house,
with some saucy blonde,

57:03.000 --> 57:08.000
and you are gonna want
to take full advantage

57:08.000 --> 57:13.000
Campfires are like catnip
for teenage girls.

57:13.000 --> 57:17.000
And all you need
is some fuel,

57:19.000 --> 57:21.000
and  voila!

57:21.000 --> 57:24.000
You're swapping spit
with a cheerleader.

57:24.000 --> 57:29.000
-Getting struck by lightning
made you weird.

57:31.000 --> 57:32.000
You just look sad to me.

57:36.000 --> 57:38.000
I look sad?

57:49.000 --> 57:52.000
There was a fire last year
that I was in charge

57:53.000 --> 57:55.000
And...

57:55.000 --> 57:58.000
I thought the wind
was doing one thing,

57:58.000 --> 58:03.000
So instead of fighting it,
we found ourselves

58:04.000 --> 58:07.000
Which is not where
you want to be.

58:11.000 --> 58:14.000
And there were three boys...

58:14.000 --> 58:16.000
around your age...

58:19.000 --> 58:22.000
They got caught in the fire,
and all I could do was watch.

58:29.000 --> 58:31.000
I watched my mother
die of cancer.

58:34.000 --> 58:38.000
It is impossible to feel sorry
for myself around you.

58:43.000 --> 58:44.000
I'm sorry.

58:45.000 --> 58:46.000
Me, too.

58:48.000 --> 58:50.000
All right. Let's just...

58:51.000 --> 58:52.000
Let's get you warm, buddy.

58:56.000 --> 58:59.000
-My dad called me buddy.
-Aw, fuck.

58:59.000 --> 59:02.000
I'm sorry,
I won't call you buddy.

59:02.000 --> 59:04.000
No, it's fine.

59:06.000 --> 59:08.000
You can call me buddy.

59:13.000 --> 59:15.000
I'm warm. Let's go.

59:21.000 --> 59:23.000
No fucking way
the kid survived that.

59:23.000 --> 59:25.000
Well, he ain't here.

59:25.000 --> 59:26.000
You want to
search up the hill?

59:28.000 --> 59:30.000
Like I said,
they'll send a team.

59:30.000 --> 59:31.000
I'll check it out.

59:31.000 --> 59:33.000
I'll tell you this much,
I've seen a thousand wrecks.

59:33.000 --> 59:36.000
There's no way
somebody survives that,

59:37.000 --> 59:40.000
Well, good.
Should be easy to find then.

1:00:22.000 --> 1:00:25.000
Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa.
What was that?

1:00:26.000 --> 1:00:27.000
Move.

1:00:37.000 --> 1:00:40.000
Yeah, the kid made it.

1:00:40.000 --> 1:00:43.000
Guess we're about to judge
your tracking skills, deputy.

1:00:45.000 --> 1:00:48.000
No, I don't think
you're gonna judge shit.

1:00:51.000 --> 1:00:53.000
Yeah, I think I'm done.

1:00:55.000 --> 1:00:58.000
I think I'm gonna
go ahead, I'm...

1:00:58.000 --> 1:01:00.000
I'm just gonna
keep my dignity.

1:01:02.000 --> 1:01:04.000
Look, we know how this thing's
gonna end, right?

1:01:05.000 --> 1:01:07.000
Fuck it, I know.

1:01:09.000 --> 1:01:11.000
So let's just fucking
do it now, huh?

1:01:11.000 --> 1:01:14.000
Play your cards right, Deputy,
you could live through this.

1:01:17.000 --> 1:01:19.000
What the fuck do I look like?
Do I...

1:01:19.000 --> 1:01:22.000
I look like
the stupidest motherfucker

1:01:22.000 --> 1:01:24.000
-Take a couple
of steps back, Jack.

1:01:24.000 --> 1:01:25.000
You gonna
let me live, huh?

1:01:26.000 --> 1:01:28.000
-Yeah.
-Oh, fuck that'd be mistake.

1:01:28.000 --> 1:01:30.000
You let me live and
I will shout your description

1:01:30.000 --> 1:01:32.000
to anybody
who will fucking listen.

1:01:32.000 --> 1:01:33.000
-No, you won't.
-I'll fucking hunt you down!

1:01:33.000 --> 1:01:36.000
You hear this fucking guy?
If I play my cards right, huh?

1:01:36.000 --> 1:01:38.000
-I will fucking kill you.
-Fucking kill me. Shoot me.

1:01:38.000 --> 1:01:40.000
-What are you waiting for?
-Give me the word, Jack.

1:01:40.000 --> 1:01:42.000
Come on, give him the word.
I'm gonna fucking

1:01:43.000 --> 1:01:44.000
-Right here!
-Jack, give me the word.

1:01:44.000 --> 1:01:46.000
Fuck you. And fuck you.

1:01:48.000 --> 1:01:49.000
Jack, move left!

1:02:00.000 --> 1:02:02.000
You will not talk. Ever.

1:02:03.000 --> 1:02:05.000
You know why?

1:02:05.000 --> 1:02:07.000
Because when
we find this boy,

1:02:08.000 --> 1:02:11.000
I'm not killing him.
You are.

1:02:13.000 --> 1:02:15.000
That's how bad I don't want
to shoot a pregnant woman.

1:02:18.000 --> 1:02:21.000
But you try this shit again,

1:02:21.000 --> 1:02:23.000
I will fucking
burn her alive.

1:02:23.000 --> 1:02:25.000
-Have I made myself clear?
-Yeah.

1:02:26.000 --> 1:02:27.000
Yeah?

1:02:28.000 --> 1:02:30.000
Now, track.

1:02:42.000 --> 1:02:44.000
Move.

1:02:50.000 --> 1:02:51.000
You okay, brother?

1:02:51.000 --> 1:02:54.000
You're not making much sense
when you talk.

1:02:54.000 --> 1:02:57.000
I am so fucking
sick of this place.

1:03:16.000 --> 1:03:18.000
-Is that a fire?
-Yeah.

1:03:20.000 --> 1:03:22.000
And it's a big one.

1:03:28.000 --> 1:03:30.000
We gotta go back.

1:03:35.000 --> 1:03:37.000
I'm not going
through that again.

1:03:37.000 --> 1:03:38.000
We can't go through  that.

1:03:38.000 --> 1:03:40.000
That eats everything
in its path.

1:03:41.000 --> 1:03:43.000
I would have seen this
from the tower.

1:03:43.000 --> 1:03:46.000
They're gonna send a chopper
to figure out why.

1:03:46.000 --> 1:03:49.000
Chopper is that way,
back there.

1:03:49.000 --> 1:03:51.000
You don't get through that.
We're going that way.

1:03:51.000 --> 1:03:52.000
All right?

1:03:56.000 --> 1:03:57.000
Now.

1:04:47.000 --> 1:04:48.000
Oh!

1:04:49.000 --> 1:04:50.000
You.

1:05:21.000 --> 1:05:25.000
-You okay?
-Oh, yeah. I'm peachy.

1:06:03.000 --> 1:06:06.000
-Turn around.
-Why? I don't care.

1:06:06.000 --> 1:06:07.000
We've shared enough today.

1:06:09.000 --> 1:06:10.000
Come on.

1:06:52.000 --> 1:06:55.000
Connor. Get down off the bed.

1:06:57.000 --> 1:06:58.000
Get down off the bed.

1:07:01.000 --> 1:07:02.000
Quiet.

1:07:15.000 --> 1:07:16.000
Listen...

1:07:16.000 --> 1:07:20.000
Those men that
came for your father,

1:07:21.000 --> 1:07:23.000
-Yeah.
-Come here.

1:07:29.000 --> 1:07:31.000
What?

1:07:31.000 --> 1:07:32.000
Is that them?

1:07:42.000 --> 1:07:43.000
That's them.

1:07:43.000 --> 1:07:46.000
-Get under the bed.
-No. We can't stay here.

1:07:46.000 --> 1:07:48.000
I know. Get under the bed.

1:07:49.000 --> 1:07:50.000
Go.

1:07:50.000 --> 1:07:52.000
Hey, how many people
stay in those?

1:07:52.000 --> 1:07:55.000
Usually one, but...

1:07:55.000 --> 1:07:58.000
from the looks of it,
there's nobody home.

1:07:58.000 --> 1:08:00.000
Somebody's home.

1:08:00.000 --> 1:08:03.000
What kind of fire watcher
leaves his cabin

1:08:04.000 --> 1:08:08.000
What are the chances
that fire watcher

1:08:08.000 --> 1:08:11.000
You're in the forest
of Montana,

1:08:16.000 --> 1:08:19.000
There's no tactical approach
to the top of that tower.

1:08:19.000 --> 1:08:22.000
He'll know whoever's up there.
They'll show themselves to him.

1:08:22.000 --> 1:08:25.000
We put them all down from here.
It's the safest play.

1:08:25.000 --> 1:08:28.000
Yeah, I don't have
a better idea.

1:08:28.000 --> 1:08:29.000
Hey, you're going
up that tower.

1:08:31.000 --> 1:08:34.000
Boy's in there,
you're gonna bring him

1:08:34.000 --> 1:08:36.000
If he isn't,

1:08:36.000 --> 1:08:39.000
start a fire in the middle
of that cabin and burn it

1:08:39.000 --> 1:08:43.000
-Why burn it?
-So I know you ain't lying.

1:08:44.000 --> 1:08:45.000
Go on, go.

1:08:46.000 --> 1:08:47.000
Move.

1:09:08.000 --> 1:09:11.000
Nobody's here!
The door's locked!

1:09:11.000 --> 1:09:14.000
It won't be the first door
you've kicked in.

1:09:17.000 --> 1:09:19.000
Come on, we need
some higher ground.

1:09:25.000 --> 1:09:28.000
If you're hidden,
you stay hid.

1:09:28.000 --> 1:09:33.000
There's a rifle trained on me.
There's two of them

1:09:46.000 --> 1:09:48.000
Connor, you're doing great.

1:09:48.000 --> 1:09:51.000
You just stay there,
okay?

1:09:52.000 --> 1:09:54.000
Don't move. Don't talk.

1:09:56.000 --> 1:09:58.000
You got a weapon in here, H.?

1:10:00.000 --> 1:10:02.000
I have a pretty sharp axe.

1:10:02.000 --> 1:10:04.000
Afraid that's not gonna do it.

1:10:05.000 --> 1:10:08.000
I, uh...

1:10:08.000 --> 1:10:10.000
I don't know how to
get us out of this.

1:10:13.000 --> 1:10:17.000
The fire's gonna be here
in about an hour.

1:10:18.000 --> 1:10:19.000
We don't have an hour.

1:10:23.000 --> 1:10:25.000
Fuck.

1:10:25.000 --> 1:10:28.000
I see nothing.
No movement.

1:10:29.000 --> 1:10:30.000
He's just standing there.

1:10:33.000 --> 1:10:34.000
I'm fading here, partner.

1:10:38.000 --> 1:10:40.000
I know.

1:10:44.000 --> 1:10:45.000
Wait, he's talking.

1:10:48.000 --> 1:10:50.000
Yeah, he's talking, Jack.

1:10:52.000 --> 1:10:54.000
Get him out of here, H!

1:10:54.000 --> 1:10:55.000
Run!

1:10:59.000 --> 1:11:01.000
- Come on, Connor!

1:11:03.000 --> 1:11:05.000
All right! Okay!

1:11:11.000 --> 1:11:13.000
Go, H!

1:11:13.000 --> 1:11:16.000
-Come on!
-Go, Connor! Go!

1:11:18.000 --> 1:11:20.000
I got you.

1:11:24.000 --> 1:11:26.000
Movement! Running west!
-Fuck.

1:11:26.000 --> 1:11:30.000
Take the shot!
Take the fucking shot!

1:11:30.000 --> 1:11:31.000
I got not shot! Fuck!

1:11:34.000 --> 1:11:36.000
Okay. We move.

1:11:38.000 --> 1:11:40.000
-Contact, right!

1:11:48.000 --> 1:11:49.000
That was a deer rifle.

1:11:50.000 --> 1:11:52.000
All right,
I'll take the shooter,

1:11:53.000 --> 1:11:57.000
If there's even a chance
that it's her...

1:11:59.000 --> 1:12:01.000
All right.

1:12:01.000 --> 1:12:03.000
Rendezvous back here.

1:12:04.000 --> 1:12:06.000
Can you cover me?

1:12:06.000 --> 1:12:08.000
-Moving.
-Move.

1:12:25.000 --> 1:12:26.000
Keep going.

1:12:28.000 --> 1:12:29.000
Toward the fire?

1:12:30.000 --> 1:12:31.000
Yeah, buddy.

1:13:03.000 --> 1:13:05.000
-

1:13:05.000 --> 1:13:07.000
-

1:13:12.000 --> 1:13:13.000
Just...

1:13:14.000 --> 1:13:17.000
stop for
a fucking minute!

1:13:25.000 --> 1:13:26.000
Where's my husband?

1:13:29.000 --> 1:13:31.000
Tower.

1:13:32.000 --> 1:13:35.000
-Is he alive?
-I don't know.

1:13:39.000 --> 1:13:40.000
You're out.

1:13:41.000 --> 1:13:43.000
Fuck.

1:14:11.000 --> 1:14:13.000
I hate this fucking place.

1:14:16.000 --> 1:14:17.000
It hates you back.

1:14:36.000 --> 1:14:37.000
Go.

1:14:48.000 --> 1:14:49.000
Come on.

1:14:53.000 --> 1:14:54.000
Come on.

1:14:55.000 --> 1:14:56.000
Come here.

1:15:00.000 --> 1:15:02.000
Come here.

1:15:02.000 --> 1:15:03.000
Come here.

1:15:04.000 --> 1:15:06.000
Listen to me.

1:15:06.000 --> 1:15:09.000
You're gonna
run a hundred yards

1:15:09.000 --> 1:15:13.000
You're gonna turn left
and you're gonna keep running

1:15:13.000 --> 1:15:17.000
When you get to a creek,
you find the deepest,

1:15:17.000 --> 1:15:20.000
-and you get in
and you lay down.

1:15:20.000 --> 1:15:22.000
-You understand?
-No.

1:15:22.000 --> 1:15:23.000
-I'm not--
-No, I'm not leaving you!

1:15:23.000 --> 1:15:26.000
Hundred yards, left. Creek.

1:15:26.000 --> 1:15:29.000
Hundred yards, left.
Say it.

1:15:31.000 --> 1:15:33.000
-Say it! Hundred yards--
-Hundred yards, left.

1:15:33.000 --> 1:15:36.000
-Hundred yards, left. Creek.
-Hundred yards, left. Creek.

1:15:36.000 --> 1:15:39.000
When you get there,
what are you gonna do?

1:15:39.000 --> 1:15:40.000
-Lay down.
-What are you gonna do?

1:15:40.000 --> 1:15:42.000
Lay down.

1:15:43.000 --> 1:15:44.000
Go.

1:15:46.000 --> 1:15:47.000
Go.

1:16:06.000 --> 1:16:09.000
Oh, shit. God damn it.

1:16:10.000 --> 1:16:11.000
Ethan?

1:16:15.000 --> 1:16:16.000
Hey, sweet girl.

1:16:19.000 --> 1:16:21.000
How did you...

1:16:22.000 --> 1:16:24.000
-Where you hit, babe?
-Yeah, I can't...

1:16:24.000 --> 1:16:26.000
I can't tell how bad it is.

1:16:26.000 --> 1:16:27.000
Will you check for an exit?

1:16:27.000 --> 1:16:30.000
-Oh, God.
-Okay.

1:16:30.000 --> 1:16:32.000
-Okay.
-Oh, shit.

1:16:35.000 --> 1:16:37.000
How bad is it? Yeah.

1:16:38.000 --> 1:16:41.000
-It ain't good, babe.
-It's okay.

1:16:41.000 --> 1:16:43.000
-Okay.
-It's okay.

1:16:43.000 --> 1:16:44.000
-Okay?
-Yeah.

1:16:45.000 --> 1:16:46.000
-Okay.
-Did you get 'em?

1:16:46.000 --> 1:16:49.000
I got one.
I don't know where

1:16:51.000 --> 1:16:54.000
You did good. All right.

1:16:55.000 --> 1:16:57.000
You gotta
get out of here now.

1:16:57.000 --> 1:16:59.000
-Hey.
-No, I'm not leaving you.

1:16:59.000 --> 1:17:01.000
It's about our baby girl.

1:17:01.000 --> 1:17:04.000
Nothing matters
if she don't make it,

1:17:06.000 --> 1:17:08.000
No one makes it
through that, baby.

1:18:58.000 --> 1:18:59.000
-

1:19:09.000 --> 1:19:11.000
Come on.

1:19:11.000 --> 1:19:13.000
You really want
to die for this kid?

1:19:15.000 --> 1:19:17.000
You don't even know him.

1:19:18.000 --> 1:19:23.000
You know, if you walk away...
right now, I won't fire.

1:19:28.000 --> 1:19:29.000
You got my word, okay?

1:19:31.000 --> 1:19:33.000
Just walk away.

1:19:37.000 --> 1:19:40.000
Hey! You looking for me?

1:19:51.000 --> 1:19:53.000
Fuck you!

1:19:58.000 --> 1:19:59.000
Connor, run!

1:20:07.000 --> 1:20:08.000
Connor!

1:20:09.000 --> 1:20:11.000
You're gonna hide, huh?

1:20:13.000 --> 1:20:17.000
I'll show you what happens
when you run and hide.

1:20:24.000 --> 1:20:26.000
When you come out,
I'll stop.

1:20:28.000 --> 1:20:31.000
Keep hiding,
I'll keep hurting her.

1:20:32.000 --> 1:20:34.000
You watching this? Huh?

1:20:34.000 --> 1:20:37.000
-Don't come out!
-Shut the fuck up!

1:20:37.000 --> 1:20:40.000
If I come out,
will you let her go?

1:20:42.000 --> 1:20:44.000
No, I won't.

1:20:44.000 --> 1:20:48.000
You know, it won't be this.
She won't suffer.

1:20:53.000 --> 1:20:55.000
Okay.

1:20:55.000 --> 1:20:56.000
Stop!

1:21:04.000 --> 1:21:05.000
That's good.

1:21:07.000 --> 1:21:08.000
Now, don't run.

1:21:10.000 --> 1:21:12.000
Okay? No more running.

1:21:16.000 --> 1:21:18.000
Can you turn around for me?

1:21:21.000 --> 1:21:23.000
That's it, just turn around.

1:22:14.000 --> 1:22:15.000
You okay?

1:22:16.000 --> 1:22:17.000
Do it.

1:22:18.000 --> 1:22:20.000
-Do it.
-Look.

1:22:26.000 --> 1:22:27.000
The fire will do it for me.

1:22:27.000 --> 1:22:30.000
-You can fucking suffer.
-Fuck you.

1:22:30.000 --> 1:22:32.000
Run. Run.

1:22:57.000 --> 1:22:59.000
They'll have planes
in the air soon.

1:22:59.000 --> 1:23:02.000
Wonder whether
we'll still be here.

1:23:06.000 --> 1:23:08.000
I don't know.

1:23:13.000 --> 1:23:15.000
I love you.

1:23:15.000 --> 1:23:17.000
I love you.

1:23:25.000 --> 1:23:26.000
Bye, babe.

1:23:56.000 --> 1:23:57.000
Run!

1:23:59.000 --> 1:24:00.000
Come on!

1:24:06.000 --> 1:24:07.000
Can you swim?

1:24:07.000 --> 1:24:10.000
What?
-Can you swim?

1:24:31.000 --> 1:24:33.000
Okay, listen to me.

1:24:33.000 --> 1:24:37.000
Take a deep breath,
hold it and lay back.

1:24:37.000 --> 1:24:38.000
Watch what I do.

1:26:18.000 --> 1:26:20.000
Hey.

1:26:25.000 --> 1:26:27.000
-I fell asleep.
-I noticed.

1:26:33.000 --> 1:26:34.000
What's wrong?

1:26:35.000 --> 1:26:37.000
Nothing.

1:26:38.000 --> 1:26:40.000
Come on. Let's go.

1:26:42.000 --> 1:26:46.000
-Where are we going?
-Anywhere but here, buddy.

1:27:32.000 --> 1:27:34.000
-Tower's still standing!
-It went right over!

1:27:39.000 --> 1:27:41.000
I got a live body!
I got a live body!

1:27:41.000 --> 1:27:44.000
-We jump here! Vic!
-You're green!

1:27:44.000 --> 1:27:46.000
Go! Go!

1:28:33.000 --> 1:28:35.000
Let's move!

1:28:45.000 --> 1:28:47.000
I got two people!

1:28:47.000 --> 1:28:49.000
My three o'clock, see 'em?

1:28:49.000 --> 1:28:50.000
-It's Hannah.
-Do you see 'em?

1:28:51.000 --> 1:28:52.000
Keep going, I got it!

1:28:52.000 --> 1:28:54.000
Go. Go.

1:29:08.000 --> 1:29:09.000
God damn, Hannah.

1:29:10.000 --> 1:29:12.000
We looked it
right in the eye.

1:29:13.000 --> 1:29:14.000
What was it like?

1:29:17.000 --> 1:29:19.000
It was beautiful.

1:29:21.000 --> 1:29:24.000
I didn't think
it was beautiful.

1:29:25.000 --> 1:29:28.000
Well, it scared the shit
out of me too, sport.

1:29:29.000 --> 1:29:31.000
Take a look at that cut.

1:29:38.000 --> 1:29:40.000
Got to win one, I see.

1:29:46.000 --> 1:29:47.000
Thanks.

1:29:53.000 --> 1:29:57.000
Jesus Christ.
The fuck happen here?

1:30:03.000 --> 1:30:05.000
-I got one on the right, now.
-I got it, I got it.

1:30:05.000 --> 1:30:08.000
Hey, hey, hey, sit down.
Sit down, honey.

1:30:09.000 --> 1:30:11.000
Allison, look at me.
Hey, look at me.

1:30:11.000 --> 1:30:13.000
-Come on, now.

1:30:13.000 --> 1:30:15.000
We need a medevac.

1:30:17.000 --> 1:30:20.000
Manifest 12-92.
I need a medevac

1:30:20.000 --> 1:30:21.000
Target my beacon, please.

1:30:22.000 --> 1:30:23.000
Roger that, 12-92...

1:30:23.000 --> 1:30:25.000
There's no rush.

1:30:29.000 --> 1:30:30.000
Okay.

1:30:43.000 --> 1:30:45.000
Is it coming back for us?

1:30:46.000 --> 1:30:48.000
Yeah, buddy,
it's coming back.

1:31:02.000 --> 1:31:06.000
It's past the tents,
near the mobile medical unit.

1:31:06.000 --> 1:31:08.000
Truck. It's a big white truck.

1:31:19.000 --> 1:31:20.000
Mmm!

1:31:22.000 --> 1:31:25.000
-You eat these?
-Three meals a day.

1:31:27.000 --> 1:31:29.000
No wonder you're so skinny.

1:31:30.000 --> 1:31:34.000
I'm lean, buddy. I'm lean.

1:31:36.000 --> 1:31:39.000
-What happens next?
-Well, you do the interview...

1:31:40.000 --> 1:31:42.000
No, I mean after that.

1:31:43.000 --> 1:31:46.000
I mean tomorrow.
Next month.

1:31:49.000 --> 1:31:51.000
Where am I gonna go?

1:31:54.000 --> 1:31:56.000
I don't know.

1:32:00.000 --> 1:32:02.000
But I promise you...

1:32:02.000 --> 1:32:04.000
we're gonna
figure it out together.

1:32:25.000 --> 1:32:28.000
Yeah, we're here, on site.

1:32:33.000 --> 1:32:36.000
-Here we go. Let's go.
-All right. All right, yeah,

1:32:36.000 --> 1:32:37.000
Got it?
- Yeah.

1:34:11.000 --> 1:34:15.000
will surely

1:34:18.000 --> 1:34:22.000
they're like ivory

1:34:22.000 --> 1:34:26.000
to guide me home
