South florida as a whole

at all uncommon

That the clothing stores nearby

Had discarded

<i> I'm brought down to a landing</i>

03:50.263 --> 03:51.797
Which was the best location

the body in the water.

03:57.204 --> 03:59.137

04:11.619 --> 04:15.121
In plantation, they don't have

<i> Extremely unusual discovery</i>

12:36.690 --> 12:39.123
She was going into publix.

12:39.125 --> 12:42.260
Det. Kendall:
<i> We obtained surveillance video</i>

12:42.262 --> 12:44.295
From inside of publix.

12:46.933 --> 12:50.335
They were able to see
the suit that she was wearing,

12:50.337 --> 12:54.539
<i> What kind of purse</i>
<i> she was wearing.</i>

12:54.541 --> 12:55.874
It was a designer purse.

12:55.876 --> 13:00.078
Rafael:<i> Because melissa</i>
<i> was known to wear nice jewelry</i>

13:00.080 --> 13:03.080
<i> And carry designer handbags</i>

13:03.082 --> 13:04.448
And things of that nature.

13:04.450 --> 13:08.252
It was a natural theory
for police to suspect

13:08.254 --> 13:12.690
That this was
a robbery gone bad.

13:12.692 --> 13:16.294
Narrator:<i> But the video</i>
doesn't show anything suspicious

13:16.296 --> 13:17.295
<i> Inside the supermarket</i>

13:17.297 --> 13:19.831
<i> And there are no</i>
<i> surveillance cameras</i>

13:19.833 --> 13:22.034
<i> Outside the store.</i>

13:22.036 --> 13:25.637
<i> Investigators check to see</i>
<i> if one of melissa's neighbors</i>

13:25.639 --> 13:28.807
<i> Might have seen</i>
<i> something unusual.</i>

13:28.809 --> 13:31.510
Det. Kendall:<i> Patrol officers</i>
<i> canvass the area.</i>

13:31.512 --> 13:34.845
We are looking for people
that may have heard screams,

13:34.847 --> 13:38.050
Gunshots, uh, cry for help.

13:38.052 --> 13:40.853
Unfortunately, after canvassing,

13:40.855 --> 13:42.553
Um, that afternoon,

13:42.555 --> 13:45.056
<i> Nobody saw</i>
<i> any suspicious vehicles,</i>

13:45.058 --> 13:47.725
Any suspicious people nearby.

13:49.128 --> 13:51.462
Narrator:
<i>Investigators are still leaning</i>

13:51.464 --> 13:52.797
<i> Towards a robbery.</i>

13:52.799 --> 13:54.698
<i> But there's one thing</i>
<i> that doesn't fit.</i>

13:54.700 --> 13:59.605
Det. Kendall:<i> Usually in those</i>
<i> carjacking robbery scenarios,</i>

13:59.607 --> 14:01.240
The body's not missing.

14:01.242 --> 14:02.473
In my experience,

14:02.475 --> 14:05.009
<i> People aren't put</i>
<i>in the back of a stolen vehicle</i>

14:05.011 --> 14:06.744
<i> Then driven away somewhere.</i>

14:06.746 --> 14:11.783
Um, so her disappearance
was really unusual.

14:20.760 --> 14:22.093
Narrator:<i> It's now the morning</i>

14:22.095 --> 14:23.494
<i> After melissa</i>
<i> is reported missing.</i>

14:23.496 --> 14:25.697
<i> An engineer is clearing</i>
<i> pumping machinery</i>

14:25.699 --> 14:28.366
<i> In a backyard canal</i>
<i> in plantation</i>

14:28.368 --> 14:31.703
<i> When he spots what appears</i>
<i> to be a mannequin</i>

14:31.705 --> 14:33.705
<i> Buried in the debris.</i>

14:33.707 --> 14:35.307
<i> But as he gets closer,</i>

14:35.309 --> 14:38.242
<i> He realizes</i>
<i> it is a woman's body.</i>

14:38.244 --> 14:40.979
Det. Kendall:
<i> It was a little after 7:00 am.</i>

14:40.981 --> 14:43.081
I was driving into work
that day.

14:43.083 --> 14:46.183
Um, I heard a report over
the police radio

14:46.185 --> 14:47.419
That a body
had been discovered.

14:47.421 --> 14:50.087
<i> Based on a brief description</i>
<i> over the radio,</i>

14:50.089 --> 14:53.991
I thought, uh, the body
that they had discovered

14:53.993 --> 14:56.161
Could be melissa lewis.

14:59.799 --> 15:01.666
<i> When she was brought out</i>
<i> of the water</i>

15:01.668 --> 15:06.938
There was very minor indications
<i> of trauma at that time,</i>

15:06.940 --> 15:08.773
Nothing obvious, no stab wounds,

15:08.775 --> 15:11.542
Uh, gunshot wounds,
things of that nature.

15:11.544 --> 15:14.478
<i> And because of the good</i>
<i> condition of the body,</i>

15:14.480 --> 15:18.850
Um, we were able to make
that identification ourself,

15:18.852 --> 15:21.285
Uh, based on
recent photographs,

15:21.287 --> 15:22.953
Driver's license picture,

15:22.955 --> 15:24.856
Um, clothing being worn.

15:25.959 --> 15:28.493
That it was melissa lewis.

15:32.832 --> 15:34.231
Narrator:
<i> Melissa's body is sent</i>

15:34.233 --> 15:37.802
To the medical examiner's office
<i> for an autopsy</i>

15:37.804 --> 15:40.339
<i> As investigators begin</i>
<i> the sad task</i>

15:40.341 --> 15:44.242
<i> Of notifying her family</i>
<i> and friends.</i>

15:44.244 --> 15:47.178
Debra:<i> I've got a call</i>
<i> from one of the detectives</i>

15:47.180 --> 15:51.049
<i> And that's when</i>
<i> everything changed.</i>

15:51.051 --> 15:53.518
And all the hope was gone.

15:53.520 --> 15:56.488
[♪♪]

15:56.490 --> 16:02.526
Debra:<i> It was just--</i>
<i> it was unbelievable.</i>

16:02.528 --> 16:07.399
I just slowly started
fading down to the floor.

16:14.208 --> 16:17.876
<i> I didn't have a sister</i>
<i> growing up</i>

16:18.878 --> 16:20.211
And just all women are
supposed to have

16:20.213 --> 16:21.612
That friend in their life,
you know?

16:21.614 --> 16:26.617
<i> And just all of a sudden</i>
<i> they're just gone.</i>

16:26.619 --> 16:29.654
I was just devastated.

16:33.827 --> 16:36.027
I know I did a lot of crying.

16:36.029 --> 16:39.296
And, um, basically
just focused on,

16:39.298 --> 16:41.031
You know, stayed with my family,

16:41.033 --> 16:44.002
<i> Focused on my kids.</i>

16:44.772 --> 16:47.005
<i> They were everything to her.</i>

16:48.108 --> 16:51.977
My kids were
just like her own.

16:52.678 --> 16:54.913
They were devastated.

16:55.915 --> 16:58.383
Devastated.

17:08.594 --> 17:10.261
[♪♪]

17:10.263 --> 17:12.930
Narrator:<i> The autopsy</i>
<i> results come in</i>

17:12.932 --> 17:18.069
<i> And the findings are chilling.</i>

17:18.071 --> 17:20.605
Det. Kendall:
There is obvious trauma

17:20.607 --> 17:23.073
To her neck area.

17:23.910 --> 17:25.476
<i> Uh, the medical examiner</i>
<i> determined that</i>

17:25.478 --> 17:31.282
<i> The cause of death</i>
<i> was manual strangulation.</i>

17:32.752 --> 17:37.588
At that point, we knew that
this case was a homicide.

17:38.826 --> 17:42.160
Shari:<i> A death like the one</i>
<i> that melissa lewis suffered</i>

17:42.162 --> 17:47.766
Would be one of the most
horrific ways a person can die.

17:47.768 --> 17:49.300
<i> Manual strangulation.</i>

17:49.302 --> 17:52.537
<i> It's a drawn out</i>
<i> way to kill someone.</i>

17:52.539 --> 17:56.974
Um, it's not something
that happens instantaneously.

17:56.976 --> 17:59.911
It takes minutes
for someone to die.

17:59.913 --> 17:59.977
It's a very personal way
to kill somebody.

18:00.178 --> 18:15.326
[♪♪]

18:15.328 --> 18:17.995
Narrator:<i> After the body</i>
<i> of missing attorney</i>

18:17.997 --> 18:19.230
<i>Melissa lewis is found floating</i>

18:19.232 --> 18:21.432
<i> In a backyard canal</i>
<i> in plantation, florida.</i>

18:21.434 --> 18:25.003
<i> Police have determined</i>
<i> that she was likely strangled</i>

18:25.005 --> 18:29.140
<i> The same evening</i>
<i> she was last seen.</i>

18:29.142 --> 18:30.708
Det. Kendall: So at this point,

18:30.710 --> 18:33.512
Her death is classified
as a murder case, a homicide,

18:33.514 --> 18:37.382
Uh, which really ramps up
the level of investigation.

18:37.384 --> 18:41.385
Narrator:<i> The canal is</i>
<i>four miles from melissa's home.</i>

18:41.387 --> 18:46.790
<i> Investigators begin</i>
an intensive search of the area.

18:46.792 --> 18:49.093
[♪♪]

18:49.095 --> 18:50.962
Det. Kendall:
<i> Our theory was that</i>

18:50.964 --> 18:52.496
<i> She was transported there</i>

18:52.498 --> 18:54.366
And in her own vehicle.

18:54.368 --> 18:57.601
<i> And then dumped by somebody</i>
<i> into the canal.</i>

18:57.603 --> 19:00.739
So we were looking
for access areas.

19:01.841 --> 19:04.241
There was a dirt road behind

19:04.243 --> 19:06.610
A small, uh, strip mall.

19:06.612 --> 19:11.415
<i> Um, where a car could drive up</i>
<i> into that area.</i>

19:11.417 --> 19:16.187
<i> It was pretty concealed</i>
<i> from the main road.</i>

19:16.189 --> 19:18.322
Someone could've easily
at night

19:18.324 --> 19:20.824
Open up
the hatch of the vehicle

19:20.826 --> 19:25.730
And either kick them down,
push them down into the canal.

19:25.732 --> 19:27.398
Narrator:<i> But the search</i>
<i> of the dirt road</i>

19:27.400 --> 19:32.070
<i> And access ramp proves</i>
<i> fruitless.</i>

19:32.072 --> 19:34.338
Det. Kendall: At first,
I was leaning

19:34.340 --> 19:35.839
Towards the carjacking
robbery scenario.

19:35.841 --> 19:40.278
<i> But the crime took place</i>
<i> in the garage of her house.</i>

19:40.280 --> 19:43.147
<i>Her pepper spray had been used.</i>

19:43.149 --> 19:46.418
<i> Her body was found miles away</i>

19:46.420 --> 19:50.922
And then her car was found
near her house.

19:50.924 --> 19:52.156
In my career,

19:52.158 --> 19:55.326
This was highly unusual
for a carjacking.

19:58.431 --> 20:00.498
Narrator:<i> The best clue</i>
<i> at the moment</i>

20:00.500 --> 20:03.133
<i> Is the nature of the killing.</i>

20:03.135 --> 20:06.370
<i> Melissa lewis was strangled.</i>

20:07.506 --> 20:10.374
<i> And because strangulation</i>
<i> is so intimate,</i>

20:10.376 --> 20:13.445
<i> The investigators conclude</i>
<i> it's very likely</i>

20:13.447 --> 20:16.114
<i> This crime was not random,</i>

20:16.116 --> 20:17.616
<i> But personal.</i>

20:17.618 --> 20:20.651
<i> So they begin to dig</i>
<i> into melissa's personal life</i>

20:20.653 --> 20:25.156
<i> Looking for someone</i>
<i> with motive to harm her.</i>

20:25.158 --> 20:26.291
We talked to her best friend

20:26.293 --> 20:29.226
<i> Who identified</i>
<i> as debra villegas,</i>

20:29.228 --> 20:30.828
A co-worker of hers,

20:30.830 --> 20:33.897
<i> And her sister,</i>
<i>who's also very close with her.</i>

20:33.899 --> 20:38.235
And we asked them everything
going on in melissa's life.

20:38.237 --> 20:40.137
Debra: They wanted to know
everything,

20:40.139 --> 20:41.672
Anybody that she came
in contact with,

20:41.674 --> 20:44.208
Anybody who might be upset
with her.

20:44.210 --> 20:47.379
Det. Kendall:
<i> They repeatedly told us, no.</i>

20:48.414 --> 20:51.016
No relationship issues,

20:51.018 --> 20:52.484
Uh, no,

20:52.486 --> 20:55.853
Uh, issues at work
with clients,

20:55.855 --> 20:57.855
Things of that nature.

20:59.091 --> 21:03.360
Carrie: I think I was grasping
at straws at that point.

21:03.362 --> 21:06.630
<i> I remembered lizzie</i>
<i> was an advocate</i>

21:06.632 --> 21:10.768
For, um, domestic violence
because of debra.

21:10.770 --> 21:14.038
<i> And I remembered my sister</i>
<i> telling me</i>

21:14.040 --> 21:17.274
<i> That debra's husband, tony,</i>

21:17.276 --> 21:21.612
Um, had threatened
to set debra on fire

21:21.614 --> 21:23.614
In front of her children.

21:23.616 --> 21:25.015
[♪♪]

21:25.017 --> 21:28.052
Carrie:<i> And that he had</i>
<i> slashed her tires.</i>

21:28.054 --> 21:30.254
<i> So I called them,</i>

21:30.256 --> 21:31.789
This man's abusive.

21:33.125 --> 21:34.258
Debra: So then, they wanted all

21:34.260 --> 21:35.827
The information
about my ex-husband

21:35.829 --> 21:38.162
And they asked, you know,
would he be upset about anything

21:38.164 --> 21:41.532
And I said, "oh, he's
very upset about everything."

21:41.534 --> 21:43.834
<i> I told them that we were going</i>
<i> through a divorce.</i>

21:43.836 --> 21:46.203
And gave them the details of
our situation as well.

21:46.205 --> 21:49.473
So they could see that
it really didn't relate to her.

21:49.475 --> 21:54.144
<i> He would, you know,</i>
<i> call and leave threats and--</i>

21:54.146 --> 21:56.480
But I just kept moving forward.

21:56.482 --> 21:59.283
You know,
don't antagonize him,

21:59.285 --> 22:00.517
Don't argue with him,

22:00.519 --> 22:03.887
Stay positive,
and move forward.

22:03.889 --> 22:07.157
<i> And I told them</i>
<i> if I were the one murdered,</i>

22:07.159 --> 22:08.759
<i> You know,</i>
<i> he would be your guy,</i>

22:08.761 --> 22:10.695
But he has no reason
to be upset with melissa.

22:10.697 --> 22:13.764
<i> He didn't even know her</i>
<i> very well.</i>

22:13.766 --> 22:15.699
Narrator:<i> Based on</i>
<i> deborah's description,</i>

22:15.701 --> 22:18.069
<i> The detectives don't consider</i>
<i> her ex-husband</i>

22:18.071 --> 22:21.272
<i> To be high on the list</i>
<i> of suspects.</i>

22:21.274 --> 22:23.974
<i>They decide to search elsewhere</i>
<i> in melissa's life</i>

22:23.976 --> 22:28.479
<i> For someone who might</i>
<i> have motive to attack her.</i>

22:30.083 --> 22:31.716
Det. Kendall:
<i> During an interview of carrie,</i>

22:31.718 --> 22:35.319
<i> She mentioned her</i>
<i> ex-husband anthony godinez</i>

22:35.321 --> 22:39.090
As someone that has
a, um, criminal history.

22:39.092 --> 22:43.662
Carrie:<i> Anthony, uh, is father</i>
<i> of my two oldest children.</i>

22:43.664 --> 22:47.365
And we were married
for 11 years.

22:48.001 --> 22:48.932
He was a drug addict

22:48.934 --> 22:51.969
And had been in prison
for armed robbery.

22:51.971 --> 22:55.406
<i> He-- he wouldn't have killed</i>
<i> her, I don't think.</i>

22:55.408 --> 22:59.376
But he had also been involved
in an armed robbery.

22:59.378 --> 23:03.248
So, you know,
uh, you just never know.

23:03.250 --> 23:06.550
So I did throw it out there.

23:06.552 --> 23:08.019
<i> I told the police</i>

23:08.021 --> 23:09.753
<i> Melissa helped me</i>
<i> fill out the divorce papers</i>

23:09.755 --> 23:12.556
And then she told me
that he came to her house.

23:12.558 --> 23:16.961
And, you know,
it startled her a little bit.

23:18.497 --> 23:20.764
Det. Kendall:
<i> We believe she was strangled</i>

23:20.766 --> 23:23.734
<i> By someone</i>
<i> who personally knew her</i>

23:23.736 --> 23:26.504
<i> On the floor of her garage.</i>

23:26.506 --> 23:29.207
<i>And anthony godinez is a felon.</i>

23:29.209 --> 23:32.176
<i> Uh, he had committed</i>
<i>an armed robbery years earlier.</i>

23:32.178 --> 23:36.047
Um, he spent some
significant time in prison.

23:37.517 --> 23:39.950
So at that point, mr. Godinez is

23:39.952 --> 23:43.754
A significant suspect
in this case.

23:43.756 --> 23:45.890
<i> We need to find him.</i>

23:49.462 --> 23:52.529
Shari: If that melissa was
going to expose

23:52.531 --> 23:55.967
His criminal episode
at the law firm

23:55.969 --> 23:57.634
That set off alarm bells.

23:57.636 --> 24:00.737
Det. Kendall:
<i> The crime lab contacted us</i> ,

24:00.739 --> 24:02.172
We have an exact match.

24:02.174 --> 24:03.573

Had absolutely nothing
to do with any of that,

37:13.132 --> 37:16.132
It seemed to lack credibility.
