01:09.757 --> 01:11.358
10 years ago Randy Slade

01:11.425 --> 01:13.927
entered North Valley High School
with a gun and a bomb.

01:13.978 --> 01:16.313
This weekend, the school
will try to memorialize

01:16.397 --> 01:19.432
those 13 students that were
slain at Slade's hands.

01:19.484 --> 01:22.268
The events will culminate
with a candlelight vigil

01:22.320 --> 01:24.771
in memory of the
North Valley High massacre.

01:24.822 --> 01:27.240
Principal Doug Givens
will read a--

02:06.080 --> 02:08.198
Aah! Uhh!

02:15.873 --> 02:18.091
Please...

02:18.159 --> 02:19.759
Please don't do this.

02:19.827 --> 02:21.661
Don't do this.

02:21.712 --> 02:24.347
Can you look me
in the eye?

02:28.169 --> 02:30.770
Good-bye,
Principal Givens.

02:30.838 --> 02:32.606
Don't leave me.

02:33.808 --> 02:35.341
You can't leave me!

02:50.024 --> 02:51.458
What--

02:53.027 --> 02:54.628
No.

02:54.695 --> 02:56.163
No!

03:04.305 --> 03:07.174
Here are Jack's
standardized test scores.

03:07.225 --> 03:09.392
Jack tells me
you read together

03:09.460 --> 03:10.894
every night you're home.

03:10.978 --> 03:12.012
We just finished

03:12.063 --> 03:13.730
"Charlie and the Chocolate
Factory Last Night."

03:13.814 --> 03:16.433
I wish you could work
with all of my kids.

03:16.517 --> 03:18.068
So he's reading
at a fourth-grade level.

03:18.152 --> 03:19.736
Mm-hmm. As you can see,

03:19.820 --> 03:21.688
his scores are high
across the board.

03:21.739 --> 03:25.325
But he seems to be holding
back in the classroom.

03:25.392 --> 03:26.576
Why do you think that is?

03:26.661 --> 03:28.895
Has he ever mentioned
a classmate named Paul?

03:28.946 --> 03:30.247
- Paul Cain?
- Mm-hmm.

03:30.331 --> 03:32.616
Yes, he's been over.
He's a friend of Jack's.

03:32.700 --> 03:35.986
Well, Paul is being
mean to Jack for some reason.

03:36.053 --> 03:37.837
How long has that
been going on?

03:37.905 --> 03:39.022
A few weeks.

03:39.090 --> 03:41.174
Jack's just his latest
target.

03:41.242 --> 03:43.710
We've moved Jack
away from Paul,

03:43.778 --> 03:46.763
and we're documenting
everything, of course.

03:48.516 --> 03:51.101
Well, Jack says that things are
going very well at school,

03:51.185 --> 03:52.886
so the steps you're
taking must be working.

03:52.937 --> 03:53.887
Thank you.

03:53.938 --> 03:55.588
Let me know
if anything changes.

03:55.640 --> 03:56.773
- Absolutely.
- Can I keep this?

03:56.857 --> 03:58.141
Sure.

03:58.226 --> 03:59.592
Thank you so much.

04:03.214 --> 04:04.731
Does anyone remember
this picture?

04:04.782 --> 04:05.815
Hotch and I were there.

04:05.900 --> 04:08.235
That's principal Doug Givens.

04:08.286 --> 04:09.819
We had to drag him to safety.

04:09.904 --> 04:12.155
High school bombing
in Boise, right?

04:12.240 --> 04:13.707
School shooter
and school bomber.

04:13.774 --> 04:16.076
A kid named Randy Slade
shot 3 students

04:16.127 --> 04:18.827
and then set off an I.E.D.
in the cafeteria via cell phone,

04:18.913 --> 04:21.831
killing himself and 13 kids total,
but not before

04:21.916 --> 04:23.583
posting all of his plans
online.

04:23.634 --> 04:25.502
It was one of those
"Where were you?" events.

04:25.586 --> 04:27.003
My whole campus
was glued to the tv.

04:27.088 --> 04:29.673
Last night, Principal Givens
was killed by a bomb

04:29.757 --> 04:32.092
modeled exactly like
the old one.

04:32.143 --> 04:33.893
It feels like the unsub
wants to attack the man

04:33.961 --> 04:35.512
who kept the school together
after the bombing.

04:35.596 --> 04:37.230
It's a pretty symbolic
target.

04:37.298 --> 04:39.599
And this week is the 10th
anniversary of the massacre.

04:39.650 --> 04:42.018
And today is the first
day of a 4-day event

04:42.103 --> 04:43.770
to commemorate
the bombing at the school.

04:43.821 --> 04:47.107
Except commemorating
it isn't enough for this unsub.

04:47.158 --> 04:50.243
No. He wants to relive it.

Andy Partridge.

06:00.149 --> 06:01.767
Perpetrators
of school violence

06:01.851 --> 06:03.769
are often sophisticated
with their weapons.

06:03.853 --> 06:06.738
Randy Slade carried his bomb
in his backpack.

06:06.823 --> 06:08.941
This guy hid his
in Givens' clock radio.

06:09.025 --> 06:10.826
Yeah, and progressive.

06:10.893 --> 06:13.161
Each one tries to top the body
count of the one previous.

06:13.229 --> 06:15.297
And they're loners by default,
not by choice.

06:15.365 --> 06:17.849
They try to join various social
groups, but they get shut out.

06:17.917 --> 06:20.085
Randy Slade wasn't a loner
at all.

06:20.169 --> 06:22.504
The family cooperated
fully with us.

06:22.572 --> 06:24.072
He was a high-functioning
psychopath,

06:24.123 --> 06:25.908
straight-A student,
varsity wrestler,

06:25.975 --> 06:27.509
lots of girlfriends.

06:27.577 --> 06:29.211
With an above-average
intelligence that made him

06:29.236 --> 06:30.436
incredibly resourceful.

06:30.597 --> 06:32.548
His explosive of choice
was Semtex.

06:32.599 --> 06:35.384
It's found at demolition sites,
but it's held under lock and key.

06:35.435 --> 06:38.086
Which made us consider
the possibility of a partner.

06:38.137 --> 06:39.555
Never found one.

06:39.606 --> 06:42.090
Slade was too much of
a narcissist to share credit.

06:42.141 --> 06:43.592
But he was also
an impulsive teen,

06:43.643 --> 06:45.644
which is what bothers me
about this unsub.

06:45.728 --> 06:47.062
His sense of control?

06:47.113 --> 06:49.031
And the end game
that he's working toward.

06:49.098 --> 06:51.733
Slade's pathology
revolved around the big kill.

06:51.784 --> 06:53.435
This unsub
could have done the same

06:53.486 --> 06:55.237
if he'd waited
for the candlelight vigil.

06:55.288 --> 06:58.240
Which means there's no
blaze of glory fantasy here.

06:58.291 --> 07:00.576
This unsub has
more bombs made,

07:00.627 --> 07:03.495
and he's savoring the
anticipation of his next attack.

07:04.780 --> 07:07.299
Boise Police Department.

07:08.301 --> 07:09.585
Agent Hotchner.

07:09.636 --> 07:10.785
Chief.

07:10.837 --> 07:12.087
Dave.

07:12.138 --> 07:14.256
Sorry to meet again
under these circumstances.

07:14.307 --> 07:17.292
Took your advice
and shut down the school.

07:17.343 --> 07:18.727
Was gonna cancel
the memorial, too,

07:18.794 --> 07:19.895
but some of the alums

07:19.962 --> 07:21.396
said they'd go through
with it anyway.

07:21.464 --> 07:23.632
Did you get the student
files to our technical analyst?

07:23.683 --> 07:25.133
Good. We'll start
with criminal records.

07:27.470 --> 07:29.521
What'd you find, Garcia?

07:29.606 --> 07:31.773
A blast from your past,
I believe.

07:31.824 --> 07:34.076
Does the name Brandon Slade
ring a bell?

07:34.143 --> 07:35.777
Yeah, the bomber's
younger brother.

07:35.828 --> 07:36.912
Sweet kid.

07:36.979 --> 07:38.914
He couldn't give us much
back then.

07:38.981 --> 07:40.582
Most 7-year-olds don't.

07:40.650 --> 07:42.367
They do, however, grow up
to become seniors

07:42.452 --> 07:43.702
who attend the same
high school.

07:43.786 --> 07:44.920
Thanks, Garcia.

07:44.987 --> 07:46.922
I thought the Slades
we're gonna leave Boise.

07:46.989 --> 07:48.256
They tried,
but the network interviews

07:48.324 --> 07:49.658
made them
nationwide pariahs.

07:49.709 --> 07:51.927
Did you question Brandon
about last night?

07:51.994 --> 07:54.212
He said he was watching
pirated movies.

07:54.297 --> 07:55.881
His mom backs him up.

07:55.965 --> 07:57.265
So does his laptop.

07:57.333 --> 07:58.850
We'll need to talk to him.

08:03.189 --> 08:04.139
Ok.

08:04.190 --> 08:06.775
So the unsub
has to be

08:06.842 --> 08:09.194
tied to the school
somehow, right?

08:09.278 --> 08:11.863
Current student, alumni,

08:11.948 --> 08:13.448
family member
who lost someone?

08:13.516 --> 08:16.184
It could be Slade groupie
celebrating his hero.

08:16.235 --> 08:18.820
He taped nails to the exterior
of the bomb,

08:18.871 --> 08:20.489
specifically
to rip open flesh.

08:20.540 --> 08:22.991
That's a sadistic detail
of Slade's the unsub copied.

08:23.042 --> 08:25.860
Except he tricked Givens
into blowing himself up.

08:25.912 --> 08:27.212
A groupie probably
wouldn't show

08:27.296 --> 08:28.630
that much self-control.

08:28.698 --> 08:30.666
But someone with an ax to grind
against the principal would.

08:30.717 --> 08:33.034
Maybe he's a surrogate
for the tormenters in high school

08:33.086 --> 08:34.219
he can't punish.

08:34.303 --> 08:35.470
Who were yours?

08:35.538 --> 08:37.889
I don't even remember.

08:37.974 --> 08:39.390
You don't even remember?

08:39.475 --> 08:41.927
Wait, were you
one of the mean girls?

08:42.010 --> 08:43.679
No.

08:43.730 --> 08:45.647
Valedictorian,
soccer scholarship,

08:45.715 --> 08:47.649
corn-fed, but still
a size zero.

08:47.717 --> 08:49.484
I think that you might
have been a mean girl.

08:49.552 --> 08:51.653
I was actually
one of the nice girls,

08:51.721 --> 08:53.321
even to guys like you.

08:53.389 --> 08:54.906
Guys like me? I'll have you know
that my social standing

08:54.991 --> 08:56.858
increased once I started
winning at basketball.

08:56.909 --> 08:58.527
Oh, yeah,
you played basketball?

08:58.578 --> 08:59.861
I didn't play.
I coached basketball.

08:59.912 --> 09:02.030
I broke down the opposing team's
shooting strategy.

09:02.081 --> 09:05.167
Is that why Morgan kicked you out
of the pool last week?

09:05.234 --> 09:08.003
Yeah. It took him 3 rounds
to realize I was hustling him.

09:08.070 --> 09:10.338
Huh.

09:10.406 --> 09:13.675
Well, it looks like we're not the
only ones interested in Brandon.

09:13.743 --> 09:17.546
It's gonna make it a lot harder
for us to talk our way in.

09:20.967 --> 09:24.102
Unless we use it
to our advantage.

09:25.921 --> 09:29.090
Good afternoon,
ladies and gentlemen.

09:29.142 --> 09:32.694
I'm SSA David Rossi
of the FBI.

09:32.762 --> 09:35.564
That's R-O-S-S-I.

09:35.615 --> 09:39.234
So if anyone has any questions,
you're free to ask them now.

09:39.285 --> 09:42.404
Does this have anything
to do with Brandon Slade?

09:42.455 --> 09:43.955
Mrs. Slade?

09:44.040 --> 09:47.159
I'm special Agent Emily Prentiss
with the FBI. This is--

09:47.226 --> 09:48.744
Go through my lawyer.

09:48.795 --> 09:51.663
Martha, we can do that.
We'll just have to come back later.

09:53.299 --> 09:55.050
Agent Hotchner.

09:55.117 --> 09:56.451
- How are you?
- What do you want?

09:56.502 --> 09:58.503
To catch the man
who killed Principal Givens.

09:58.588 --> 10:00.756
Well, then go catch him.
But it wasn't my son.

10:00.807 --> 10:02.674
Let us prove that
for you.

10:02.759 --> 10:05.560
Once we rule him out, we can
get these people off your lawn.

10:05.628 --> 10:07.295
Martha, you can observe.
You can stop us and call

10:07.346 --> 10:08.680
your lawyer
whenever you want.

10:11.317 --> 10:15.570
Agent Rossi was always
very nice to Brandon.

10:15.638 --> 10:17.022
Let him do it.

10:17.106 --> 10:18.256
It's unlikely...

10:18.324 --> 10:19.424
Dave.

10:19.492 --> 10:20.742
All right, feel free
to call me

10:20.810 --> 10:22.944
if you have any other
background questions.

10:22.995 --> 10:26.147
My phone number
is 702-555-0103.

10:26.199 --> 10:27.933
And what's your name, sir?

10:28.000 --> 10:33.154
It's Dr. Spencer Reid.
R-E-I-d.

10:38.160 --> 10:42.430
You know, there's
a sniper right be--ooh!

10:42.498 --> 10:44.382
Never mind.

10:44.450 --> 10:47.135
When did you become
a gamer, old man?

10:47.186 --> 10:49.271
Oh, a while back.
After this kid told me

10:49.338 --> 10:52.224
how much he loved playing
with his big brother.

10:52.308 --> 10:53.692
Will you sign this
for me?

10:57.563 --> 11:00.448
First edition. I'm touched.

11:00.516 --> 11:01.783
You're a good writer.

11:01.851 --> 11:03.652
So are you.

11:03.703 --> 11:06.321
I read one of your
AP English essays.

11:06.372 --> 11:10.709
"The futility of Jay Gatsby
and the green light."

11:10.793 --> 11:12.077
Where'd you get that?

11:12.161 --> 11:14.246
Well, I was curious
as to, uh,

11:14.330 --> 11:16.965
what kind of kid
you grew up to be.

11:17.032 --> 11:19.417
Apparently a smart one.

11:19.502 --> 11:22.271
But that didn't stop you
from getting beaten up

11:22.296 --> 11:23.371
on a regular basis.

11:23.372 --> 11:25.140
You know how it is
with fans.

11:25.207 --> 11:27.726
I mean, you bang yours,
mine kick my ass.

11:29.178 --> 11:34.015
And, uh, Principal Givens,
he couldn't stop that, could he?

11:34.066 --> 11:37.018
That must have really
ticked you off.

11:37.069 --> 11:39.354
Listen, I already
told the police, ok,

11:39.405 --> 11:41.273
I was watching movies
on my computer.

11:41.357 --> 11:43.558
Well, just because
you downloaded them

11:43.609 --> 11:47.162
doesn't mean you sat here
and watched them.

11:47.229 --> 11:49.447
You were cool
10 years ago.

11:49.532 --> 11:51.416
So were you.

11:55.538 --> 11:57.789
When did Harry leave?

11:59.292 --> 12:02.744
About 5 years ago.

12:02.795 --> 12:04.746
He got his fresh start,

12:04.797 --> 12:07.248
and I got the underwater
mortgage.

12:07.300 --> 12:11.252
Is that why Brandon ended up
in North Valley?

12:11.304 --> 12:13.755
I did my best.

12:13.806 --> 12:16.641
But I know my son.

12:16.726 --> 12:18.092
He wouldn't have
done this.

12:18.144 --> 12:20.929
Just want to see if you took
after your big brother.

12:20.980 --> 12:22.096
You know what, dude?
I did it, all right?

12:22.148 --> 12:23.431
So go ahead, cuff me.

12:23.482 --> 12:25.734
Actually, dude,
I don't think

12:25.785 --> 12:27.068
you're mean enough
to have done it.

12:27.119 --> 12:28.737
But tell me the truth.

12:28.788 --> 12:31.539
You're happy that Principal Givens
is dead, aren't you?

12:31.607 --> 12:34.209
Yes, I'm happy.
It's what Randy wanted.

12:34.276 --> 12:35.877
Well, Randy wanted
the whole school dead.

12:35.945 --> 12:37.829
Yeah.

12:37.914 --> 12:39.247
Right.

12:40.499 --> 12:43.335
Whoa. Am I missing
something here, Brandon?

12:43.419 --> 12:46.755
No, you got it
all figured out.

12:48.123 --> 12:51.726
Well, did Randy have
some sort of agenda?

12:51.794 --> 12:55.430
Did he target specific people
inside of the school?

12:55.481 --> 12:57.899
Everybody knew who he wanted
to take out.

12:57.967 --> 13:00.852
We didn't. We couldn't find
any logic to his actions.

13:00.937 --> 13:02.854
So how do you know? Huh?

13:02.939 --> 13:04.572
Did he tell you?

13:04.640 --> 13:08.777
Did a 17-year-old
confide in a 7-year-old?

13:08.828 --> 13:11.780
Did you find something?

13:11.831 --> 13:15.867
He had a list, didn't he?

13:17.987 --> 13:20.288
I want my lawyer.

13:24.510 --> 13:28.213
If he still has the list,
it's somewhere in that room.

13:29.665 --> 13:34.102
Martha, do you know
anything about this?

13:34.169 --> 13:36.170
I can have a search warrant
in an hour.

13:36.222 --> 13:37.338
Mom--
no.

13:37.390 --> 13:39.007
Tear it apart.

13:39.058 --> 13:40.892
No--no, mom, please!

13:55.190 --> 13:56.624
Louie, oh, my God.

13:56.692 --> 13:58.376
Hey.

13:58.461 --> 13:59.377
Chelsea.

13:59.462 --> 14:00.879
Get in here.

14:02.465 --> 14:04.833
I thought this was
too lame for you.

14:04.884 --> 14:06.334
No, are you kidding?
I wouldn't miss it.

14:06.385 --> 14:08.219
Oh.

14:08.304 --> 14:12.007
I heard about Principal Givens
when my flight landed.

14:13.509 --> 14:14.893
How you holding up?

14:14.977 --> 14:19.014
Better, now that I'm on
the next flight out of here.

14:19.065 --> 14:21.850
Are you kidding?
You can't leave.

14:21.901 --> 14:23.234
I already survived
one psychopath.

14:23.319 --> 14:25.320
I'm not about
to stare down another.

14:27.139 --> 14:31.359
Yeah, but people need you
right now.

14:31.410 --> 14:33.609
You need to show them
that we're not afraid

14:33.634 --> 14:34.834
of guys like Randy Slade.

14:35.364 --> 14:37.916
Yeah, well, I am afraid
of guys like Randy Slade.

14:38.000 --> 14:40.418
And I'm sick of hearing
what people want.

14:40.503 --> 14:42.754
People who weren't
in the cafeteria.

14:42.838 --> 14:44.005
People like you.

14:47.076 --> 14:48.927
Just...

14:49.011 --> 14:51.830
Please, go.

14:51.832 --> 14:53.765
Ok?

15:14.787 --> 15:16.404
Please,

15:16.455 --> 15:20.075
Lewis, you're not gonna
change my mind.

15:27.359 --> 15:30.194
Yeah, bookshelf is clean.

15:30.279 --> 15:33.197
I love dating readers,
hate profiling them.

15:33.282 --> 15:35.366
"Catcher in the Rye,"
"Atlas Shrugged."

15:35.450 --> 15:37.485
These are all titles that a
teenage kid would obsess over,

15:37.536 --> 15:39.904
but Randy made that list
when Brandon was just a kid.

15:39.988 --> 15:45.159
You're right. So, however
Brandon got his hands on that list,

15:45.210 --> 15:49.463
he would have hid it in something
a 7-year-old would read.

15:54.369 --> 15:57.505
Hotch! We found it.

15:57.556 --> 16:00.341
Principal Givens
is on this list.

16:03.878 --> 16:05.062
You're on speaker, JJ.

16:05.147 --> 16:07.064
So we might have another one.

16:07.149 --> 16:08.516
Might?

16:08.567 --> 16:11.268
One of the North Valley alumni
was killed in her motel room.

16:11.353 --> 16:14.021
No bomb or gun this time.
Looks like he used his bare hands.

16:14.072 --> 16:15.356
You got a name?

16:15.407 --> 16:16.741
Chelsea Grant.

16:18.076 --> 16:19.860
She's on the list.

16:23.248 --> 16:25.182
The unsub crushed
Chelsea's throat

16:25.250 --> 16:27.618
so she couldn't scream,
then he pulverized her ribs,

16:27.686 --> 16:29.870
sending fragments of bone
into her heart.

16:29.921 --> 16:32.123
Principal Givens was high-profile.
Chelsea wasn't.

16:32.207 --> 16:35.126
Right now the only thing connecting
them is they're both on the kill list.

16:35.210 --> 16:36.627
A list that Brandon kept
secret for 10 years.

16:36.695 --> 16:37.995
But he was in custody
when this happened.

16:38.063 --> 16:39.847
The question is,
how did the unsub

16:39.914 --> 16:41.248
get the exact same list?

16:41.299 --> 16:44.352
We ruled out a partner,
but not conclusively.

16:44.419 --> 16:45.853
Slade made every part
of his plan public.

16:45.920 --> 16:47.805
It doesn't make sense
that he would hide a partner.

16:47.889 --> 16:49.306
He didn't want
to share the credit.

16:49.391 --> 16:52.309
And this weekend is the partner's
best chance to claim it.

16:52.394 --> 16:56.047
Partners of dominant psychopaths
are usually submissive,

16:56.114 --> 16:58.265
but that doesn't mean that
they can't be intelligent

16:58.316 --> 16:59.950
or that they're
physically weak.

17:00.035 --> 17:01.952
This unsub laid low
after the bombing

17:02.037 --> 17:03.487
and successfully
evaded police and FBI.

17:03.572 --> 17:05.573
That took cunning
and patience,

17:05.624 --> 17:07.375
which he's exhibiting now
with his current murders.

17:07.442 --> 17:09.877
We think he fits the loner
profile Slade debunked.

17:09.944 --> 17:11.779
He grew up
in an abusive home,

17:11.829 --> 17:14.548
which kept him from forming the
normal social bonds in high school.

17:14.616 --> 17:17.451
We interviewed all the outcasts
from back then.

17:17.502 --> 17:19.118
How did this guy
slip through?

17:19.171 --> 17:21.388
Even outcasts eventually
form friendships.

17:21.455 --> 17:24.759
But this unsub was the outcast
the outcasts rejected.

17:24.810 --> 17:26.594
He won't stand out
in any capacity,

17:26.645 --> 17:28.479
and as a matter of fact,
most of his fellow students

17:28.563 --> 17:30.848
probably won't even remember
graduating with him.

17:30.932 --> 17:33.984
And that invisibility is what
made him attractive to Slade.

17:34.069 --> 17:36.687
This partner wouldn't
steal the spotlight.

17:36.772 --> 17:39.190
Slade turned to the cafeteria
because most of the names on his list

17:39.274 --> 17:41.108
ate there together
during fifth period.

17:41.159 --> 17:42.976
So his hatred festered
when the names on the list

17:43.028 --> 17:44.978
emerged from the cafeteria
as media heroes.

17:45.030 --> 17:47.581
And now he wants to finish
the job that Randy started.

17:47.649 --> 17:50.112
Emotionally, this weekend is
more a high school reunion

17:50.137 --> 17:51.335
to him than a memorial.

17:51.336 --> 17:54.422
We go to reunions to show
who we grew up to be.

17:54.489 --> 17:57.758
Often that means changing
everything about who we were.

17:57.826 --> 17:59.927
Consciously or not,
Randy Slade revealed clues

17:59.994 --> 18:02.963
as to his partner's identity
when he detonated his bomb.

18:03.014 --> 18:05.266
Agent Prentiss will be conducting
cognitive interviews

18:05.333 --> 18:06.884
to see what the survivors
might remember.

18:06.968 --> 18:10.221
You want us to walk through
what happened that day?

18:10.305 --> 18:12.005
Didn't we do that
when we were seniors?

18:12.057 --> 18:14.341
Yes, but there may be
some details that

18:14.392 --> 18:16.055
you didn't think were
important at the time

18:16.080 --> 18:17.280
that could help us now,

18:17.646 --> 18:20.180
things that could help us
learn about the partner.

18:20.232 --> 18:22.450
Randy made us all
lie face-down.

18:22.517 --> 18:23.784
I didn't see anything.

18:23.852 --> 18:25.286
None of us did.

18:25.353 --> 18:26.987
Well, that's not true.

18:27.038 --> 18:29.457
Jerry did. He's the guy
Randy made lock the doors.

18:29.524 --> 18:31.191
Yeah. Yeah, I did.

18:31.243 --> 18:33.861
The interviews
we're going to conduct

18:33.912 --> 18:37.081
won't focus on what you saw,
but what you felt.

18:37.165 --> 18:38.632
You want me to tell you
how I felt

18:38.700 --> 18:40.718
licking the tile
in the cafeteria?

18:40.802 --> 18:43.170
Thanks, I do that
at therapy twice a week.

18:43.221 --> 18:44.787
How about how I feel now,
seeing my name on a list

18:44.812 --> 18:46.317
of people who should be dead?

18:46.675 --> 18:49.477
The Boise police have offered
everyone on this list

18:49.544 --> 18:50.811
a protective detail.

18:50.879 --> 18:52.429
Like that would have
done Chelsea any good.

18:52.514 --> 18:54.932
She was killed
in her hotel room.

18:55.016 --> 18:56.684
Jerry's not on the list.

18:56.735 --> 18:58.719
Let him help you. I'm out.

19:00.522 --> 19:03.724
Ever get volunteered
for a job you don't want?

19:05.360 --> 19:07.328
So, as you can see
from your board there,

19:07.395 --> 19:09.663
this kill list is weirdly similar
to high school.

19:09.731 --> 19:11.499
Group one is like
the popular kids--

19:11.566 --> 19:13.951
prom court, football team,
Dean's list.

19:14.035 --> 19:15.286
The Heathers, if you will.

19:15.370 --> 19:17.121
Kids in Slade's social circle.

19:17.205 --> 19:18.289
What about number two?

19:18.373 --> 19:19.874
Uh, mm-hmm,
that would be the kids

19:19.925 --> 19:21.425
from the other side
of the tracks,

19:21.510 --> 19:24.011
180-degree difference, kids this
close to getting kicked out--

19:24.078 --> 19:26.380
stoners, burnouts, mental cases.

19:26.431 --> 19:28.382
Chelsea Grant is on this list.

19:28.433 --> 19:30.634
Maybe Slade targeted them
because they disgusted him?

19:30.719 --> 19:33.304
But they didn't threaten
Slade's sense of superiority.

19:33.388 --> 19:34.939
He wouldn't have even cared
about them.

19:35.023 --> 19:37.308
All right, well, maybe the
partner put them on the list.

19:37.392 --> 19:39.310
They'd be closer to his
social status than Slade's.

19:39.394 --> 19:40.811
Why would the--

19:40.896 --> 19:42.029
I'm so sorry.

19:42.096 --> 19:45.449
Why would the unsub list
kids that he fit in with?

19:45.534 --> 19:46.951
Apparently that's how
this clique worked.

19:47.035 --> 19:48.953
The kids in it were meaner to each
other than kids on the outside.

19:49.037 --> 19:51.074
Garcia, separate out
all the kids who got

19:51.099 --> 19:52.299
into trouble regularly.

19:52.490 --> 19:56.460
Then eliminate the names that
the partner put on the list.

19:56.545 --> 19:57.962
Now, who's left that
came to the memorial?

19:58.046 --> 20:00.331
Right. Whoever made the list
wouldn't put their name on it.

20:00.415 --> 20:01.749
Uh...

20:03.385 --> 20:05.452
Sir, I think--

20:05.503 --> 20:07.788
I think I've got him.

20:23.405 --> 20:25.189
Lewis Ramsey.

20:25.273 --> 20:26.824
FBI.

20:26.908 --> 20:28.943
Put the drink down.
You're coming with us.

20:30.779 --> 20:31.912
Thanks for doing this.

20:31.980 --> 20:35.249
So, I have some crime scene
photos from the day

20:35.316 --> 20:37.084
if you'd like
to take a look.

20:37.151 --> 20:38.502
I don't need them.

20:38.587 --> 20:40.337
Ok.

20:40.405 --> 20:43.340
It was 12:50.

20:43.425 --> 20:44.875
Lunch had just started.

20:44.960 --> 20:46.510
It was Thursday.

20:46.595 --> 20:48.963
When did you first
notice Randy?

20:50.181 --> 20:53.517
He came in
talking on his cell.

20:56.671 --> 20:58.272
Did you hear
the conversation?

20:58.340 --> 20:59.640
He was talking to his mom.

20:59.691 --> 21:01.141
But that's not what
I noticed first.

21:01.192 --> 21:02.509
What did you notice?

21:03.862 --> 21:06.447
The gun in his hand.

21:06.514 --> 21:08.699
Natalie Gallo,
she was the first.

21:10.619 --> 21:13.153
She never even saw it.

21:14.372 --> 21:16.624
Someone asked him
what he was doing and he...

21:16.691 --> 21:17.741
What are you doing?

21:17.826 --> 21:20.628
Turned and shot him
in the chest.

21:20.695 --> 21:24.915
So, uh...Nobody
said anything after that.

21:26.334 --> 21:29.086
That was when he ordered you
to lock the doors, right?

21:29.170 --> 21:32.873
Jerry, let's go.
Lock the doors.

21:32.924 --> 21:35.843
And then he started
playing the game.

21:37.746 --> 21:39.179
Yeah.

21:40.248 --> 21:42.182
Randy went table to table.

21:42.233 --> 21:44.051
He was ranting.

21:44.102 --> 21:45.719
What did he say?

21:48.106 --> 21:49.773
I am God.

21:49.858 --> 21:54.361
Now, who's brave enough
to look God in the eye?

21:54.412 --> 21:55.679
How about you, Brad?

21:55.747 --> 21:57.948
Hmm?
Huh?

21:58.033 --> 22:00.233
Can you look me in the eye?

22:00.285 --> 22:02.235
When kids didn't,
he shot them.

22:02.287 --> 22:04.071
No?

22:05.707 --> 22:08.008
Allison.

22:08.076 --> 22:09.009
Protect us
in our hour...

22:09.077 --> 22:11.462
Allison, stop praying.

22:12.547 --> 22:14.381
Never mind.

22:16.267 --> 22:19.887
He walked up next to me.

22:19.938 --> 22:22.389
How about you?

22:22.440 --> 22:24.308
We were never close, but...

22:24.392 --> 22:25.309
Hmm?

22:25.393 --> 22:27.061
We were always cool.

22:27.112 --> 22:31.031
I don't know what
made me think I could do it.

22:31.099 --> 22:33.484
But I did.

22:33.568 --> 22:35.152
I looked him in the eye.

22:35.236 --> 22:36.236
Poof.

22:38.406 --> 22:40.958
You're not even worth
a bullet.

22:43.244 --> 22:46.413
He walked to his backpack...

22:46.464 --> 22:48.465
Pulled out the bomb...

22:50.969 --> 22:54.588
And he walked
right over there...

22:57.442 --> 22:58.509
He said...

22:58.593 --> 23:02.062
I...Am...God!

23:06.434 --> 23:09.019
And like that,
10 kids were gone.

23:12.640 --> 23:17.411
Those reporters always
asked me about that.

23:17.478 --> 23:20.147
Why did he detonate so early?

23:23.201 --> 23:25.102
I still don't know.

23:26.371 --> 23:29.423
Now, let's go back
for a second.

23:29.490 --> 23:33.827
Randy was pointing
the gun at you.

23:33.878 --> 23:36.630
Did you see the cell phone
in his hand?

23:39.217 --> 23:40.500
Yeah.

23:40.552 --> 23:42.603
What was on it?

23:42.670 --> 23:43.604
I--I don't know.

23:43.671 --> 23:45.606
It was the detonator.

23:45.673 --> 23:48.475
All I saw
was the black casing.

23:48.526 --> 23:50.060
The black cell phone?

23:50.145 --> 23:51.395
Are you sure?

23:51.479 --> 23:53.814
Yeah. Why?

23:53.865 --> 23:57.201
The gray cell phone
was the detonator.

23:57.285 --> 24:00.437
The black cell was the one
he'd talked to his mother on.

24:00.439 --> 24:02.122
Uh, that's what I meant.

24:02.190 --> 24:03.457
The gray one.

24:03.524 --> 24:05.959
It's just a mistake.
Sorry.

24:08.379 --> 24:11.081
I'm telling you,
I didn't kill her.

24:11.166 --> 24:12.800
Then how do you explain your
fingerprints in her room?

24:12.867 --> 24:15.836
Ok, I saw her last
night, but I wouldn't...

24:15.887 --> 24:18.555
She's my friend.

24:18.640 --> 24:20.724
You're very convincing,
Lewis.

24:20.809 --> 24:23.093
But you were convincing
10 years ago, too.

24:23.178 --> 24:26.396
So what was your excuse
for not being in the cafeteria?

24:26.481 --> 24:29.766
Oh, yeah. You were blazing up
in the back parking lot, right?

24:29.851 --> 24:32.436
That wasn't an excuse.
It was the truth.

24:32.520 --> 24:34.154
Yeah, of course it was.

24:34.222 --> 24:36.156
It also allowed you
to pose as a loser.

24:36.224 --> 24:37.991
The very type
you wanted to kill.

24:38.059 --> 24:40.894
You know how we know?

24:42.197 --> 24:43.447
You wrote it down.

24:43.531 --> 24:46.466
"All the losers
in this godforsaken school."

24:49.621 --> 24:52.840
I didn't write that one.

24:52.907 --> 24:55.792
But you did type up
the rest of the list.

25:00.348 --> 25:01.715
Yes.

25:02.851 --> 25:06.470
Lewis, we know how guys
like Randy make friends.

25:06.554 --> 25:08.455
They build up rapport
through secrecy.

25:08.523 --> 25:10.190
Only the two of you
are smart enough

25:10.258 --> 25:12.860
to see through the CS
of high school, right?

25:12.927 --> 25:15.112
And it felt so good
doing whatever Randy said

25:15.196 --> 25:16.647
and not have to tell
anybody about it.

25:16.731 --> 25:18.448
Make me a list of kids
we should kill.

25:18.533 --> 25:19.533
Sure, Randy.

25:19.600 --> 25:20.784
Get me a pound of Semtex

25:20.852 --> 25:22.119
from your dad's
construction site.

25:22.203 --> 25:23.704
Whatever you say, Randy.

25:23.771 --> 25:24.988
But I never thought
that he would--

25:25.073 --> 25:26.206
He would use you?

25:26.274 --> 25:29.576
You were mad
that he actually did it.

25:29.627 --> 25:31.495
But you were also mad
that he left you behind.

25:31.563 --> 25:32.963
That's not true.

25:33.031 --> 25:34.498
Then why come back?

25:34.582 --> 25:36.216
What does a loser
like you

25:36.284 --> 25:38.919
have to gain by seeing all
the kids that he hated so much?

25:44.976 --> 25:48.061
I came this close to flushing
two years of sobriety

25:48.129 --> 25:50.681
down the toilet tonight.

25:50.748 --> 25:52.149
Not just because
Chelsea died,

25:52.233 --> 25:53.760
but because I knew
that they were gonna

25:53.785 --> 25:55.385
cancel that ceremony.

25:57.155 --> 26:01.608
See, tomorrow night

26:01.659 --> 26:05.779
I was gonna tell people
what I did.

26:05.830 --> 26:11.118
And I knew that
I would be arrested

26:11.169 --> 26:13.754
as an accomplice.

26:13.821 --> 26:15.956
I knew it, but...

26:18.492 --> 26:20.294
I had to.

26:22.180 --> 26:25.215
This is my final
amends.

26:27.018 --> 26:29.052
You buy it?

26:29.137 --> 26:31.305
He fits the profile,
and the evidence points to him,

26:31.356 --> 26:32.639
but he seems sincere.

26:32.690 --> 26:34.358
He's not the unsub.
He was the partner,

26:34.442 --> 26:36.363
but look at how Slade added
"all the LoSeRs in this

26:36.388 --> 26:37.588
Godforsaken school."

26:37.629 --> 26:40.147
This capitalization
isn't an accident. Look.

26:40.198 --> 26:41.898
L-S-R--

26:41.983 --> 26:43.784
Lewis Stuart Ramsey.

26:43.851 --> 26:45.786
So Slade named
his own partner.

26:45.853 --> 26:48.322
Ironically, Lewis' marijuana
conviction saved his life.

26:48.373 --> 26:50.490
Well, that puts us back
to our original problem.

26:50.541 --> 26:51.825
If the unsub
isn't the partner,

26:51.876 --> 26:53.243
how did he get
his hands on a list

26:53.328 --> 26:55.162
that Slade and Lewis
kept to themselves?

26:55.213 --> 26:57.631
The only answer is that part of
the profile is wrong.

26:57.698 --> 26:59.633
The unsub's vendetta
has nothing to do with the list.

26:59.700 --> 27:01.251
Did you get anything
from Jerry Holtz?

27:01.336 --> 27:03.920
Only that he mixed up
the cell phones that Slade used.

27:04.005 --> 27:06.423
It felt like he was
making the story up,

27:06.507 --> 27:08.041
but I only had a hunch.

27:08.092 --> 27:09.246
We need to find him now.
There's a connection

27:09.271 --> 27:10.338
to the victimology
that we're missing.

27:10.339 --> 27:12.246
Whatever he's holding
back might be the key.

27:18.686 --> 27:20.887
I'm so sorry.

27:23.574 --> 27:26.059
I'm so sorry.

27:28.196 --> 27:29.780
Boo.

27:29.864 --> 27:31.498
Ohh!

27:31.565 --> 27:32.949
Oh! Ohh!

27:33.034 --> 27:35.085
Can you look me
in the eye, Jerry?

27:35.169 --> 27:36.670
Huh?!

27:36.737 --> 27:38.255
Look at me!

27:38.339 --> 27:39.256
Look at me!
Look at me!

27:39.340 --> 27:40.707
Look at me!

27:40.758 --> 27:41.708
I didn't know!

27:41.759 --> 27:43.176
I didn't know.

27:43.244 --> 27:44.795
That's the point.

27:44.879 --> 27:47.214
They're gonna find out.

27:47.265 --> 27:50.750
Uhh! Uhh! Uhh!

28:02.546 --> 28:04.080
Jerry Holtz?

28:04.164 --> 28:05.197
How long?

28:05.249 --> 28:06.299
Less than an hour.

28:06.366 --> 28:07.700
Security guard
heard the commotion,

28:07.751 --> 28:09.201
but the unsub
was already gone.

28:09.253 --> 28:11.754
The only people who knew we were
doing the cognitive interviews

28:11.839 --> 28:14.140
were the other survivors.
The unsub must be part of that group.

28:14.207 --> 28:15.892
Well, we don't know that
for a fact.

28:15.976 --> 28:17.376
He could have been
lying in wait.

28:17.427 --> 28:19.595
Look, Hotch wants me
to go through the victims' lives

28:19.680 --> 28:22.231
and find the overlap. We can
compare their histories with the unsub's.

28:22.316 --> 28:23.382
Well, what else
do we have to go on?

28:23.433 --> 28:25.184
Spence said the unsub
would have broken his hand

28:25.235 --> 28:26.719
beating Chelsea to death.
Did you notice anyone

28:26.770 --> 28:28.988
with a cast on their hand,
someone who seemed hurt?

28:29.055 --> 28:29.989
No.

28:30.056 --> 28:31.574
I might know why.

28:31.658 --> 28:34.944
This unsub
doesn't feel pain.

28:35.028 --> 28:37.780
There's a medical condition
called pain asymbolia,

28:37.865 --> 28:39.665
where patients register
harmful stimuli

28:39.733 --> 28:41.284
without being bothered by it.
They've been documented

28:41.368 --> 28:43.569
holding their hand
over an open flame

28:43.620 --> 28:44.934
because their brain
doesn't send pain signals

28:44.959 --> 28:46.159
to the central nervous system.

28:46.874 --> 28:48.240
Sounds pretty rare.
You sure the unsub has it?

28:48.292 --> 28:49.342
The crime scenes prove it.

28:49.409 --> 28:51.177
This unsub displayed
an unusual level

28:51.244 --> 28:52.595
of savagery
towards his victims.

28:52.679 --> 28:53.713
And consider this--

28:53.764 --> 28:55.848
he smashed through
a glass display case,

28:55.916 --> 28:57.800
but there were not cuts
on Jerry. That means

28:57.885 --> 28:59.902
he most likely punched
through it as a show of force.

28:59.970 --> 29:01.743
Now, the only way
the human body could

29:01.768 --> 29:02.922
withstand that level of pain

29:02.923 --> 29:04.523
is if he couldn't feel it
at all.

29:04.591 --> 29:06.264
It must take a major toll

29:06.289 --> 29:08.389
on someone's emotional
development.

29:08.469 --> 29:10.351
A significant contributor
to our sense of empathy

29:10.397 --> 29:11.781
is the way we personally
experience pain.

29:11.865 --> 29:13.933
And the unsub didn't develop
his sense of empathy

29:14.001 --> 29:15.368
because it was cut off.

29:15.435 --> 29:17.036
Does every person
with asymbolia have this?

29:17.103 --> 29:18.504
Actually, most feel
empathy just fine,

29:18.572 --> 29:21.207
which makes me think the rest
of our profile is still accurate.

29:21.274 --> 29:22.325
Loner, invisible,

29:22.409 --> 29:23.542
Outcast, boiling rage--

29:23.610 --> 29:25.044
son of a bitch!

29:25.111 --> 29:27.546
Hi! This is Dr. Spencer Reid.
I actually can come to the phone

29:27.614 --> 29:29.298
right now with a very special
message that your mother is--

29:29.383 --> 29:30.333
Reid.

29:30.417 --> 29:31.884
Sorry. I'm really sorry.

29:31.952 --> 29:33.636
I don't know what got into me.
Where were we?

29:33.720 --> 29:35.755
I'm going to have
Garcia check medical records.

29:35.806 --> 29:37.122
What causes asymbolia?

29:38.625 --> 29:42.428
S-s-severe trauma produces
lesions in the insular cortex,

29:42.496 --> 29:45.481
usually after a stroke.
But this unsub's so young,

29:45.565 --> 29:48.317
it's most likely caused by
an external factor.

29:48.402 --> 29:50.019
Like a bomb going off
next to him?

29:50.103 --> 29:51.821
Yeah, a bomb going off
next to him.

29:56.443 --> 29:58.110
I will crush you.

29:59.112 --> 30:01.831
- What?
- What?

30:03.817 --> 30:05.918
It's so weird
seeing yearbooks again.

30:05.986 --> 30:08.087
A friend of mine who teaches
said that Facebook

30:08.154 --> 30:09.622
is making them obsolete.

30:09.673 --> 30:12.992
I'm having serious flashbacks
going through these senior BIOS.

30:13.043 --> 30:16.429
Four years of accomplishments
boiled down to one paragraph.

30:16.496 --> 30:19.548
Hey, did your school have
anything called "top 10"?

30:19.633 --> 30:21.884
Mm, no. Is it
an academic thing?

30:21.969 --> 30:23.052
No, I don't think so.

30:23.136 --> 30:25.388
Only 10 of the survivors
listed it,

30:25.472 --> 30:27.273
including Jerry and Chelsea,

30:27.340 --> 30:30.810
and neither one of them
were valedictorian material.

30:30.861 --> 30:34.530
Ok, so...What are we
looking at here?

30:34.614 --> 30:37.483
Well, maybe it's a clique
inside a clique.

30:37.534 --> 30:40.286
Yeah, but it's jocks,
nerds, theater geeks.

30:40.353 --> 30:43.789
Nothing that would bring
these kids together.

30:43.857 --> 30:46.625
Except...

30:46.693 --> 30:49.078
What?

30:49.162 --> 30:51.380
I know what the top 10 is.

30:56.470 --> 30:58.220
Hey, Tiffany.

30:58.305 --> 31:00.089
Where you going?

31:00.173 --> 31:02.558
Uh, there's gonna be
a get-together

31:02.642 --> 31:03.893
for the survivors.

31:03.977 --> 31:07.680
Didn't you hear?
They canceled the vigil.

31:07.731 --> 31:08.898
I know.

31:08.982 --> 31:11.734
That's why some of us
are getting together

31:11.818 --> 31:14.186
at the Seven Stars
Restaurant later.

31:14.237 --> 31:16.822
Great. I'll join you.

31:16.890 --> 31:18.240
I would love that,

31:18.325 --> 31:20.910
but it's kind of
a top 10 thing.

31:20.994 --> 31:24.280
Well, top 8 now.

31:24.364 --> 31:26.198
Oh.

31:26.249 --> 31:28.584
You understand, right?

31:28.668 --> 31:30.836
Totally.

31:30.904 --> 31:34.290
Tell everyone I say hi.

31:34.374 --> 31:35.841
Ok.

31:42.716 --> 31:44.216
- Recognize the top 10?
- No.

31:44.267 --> 31:45.601
They were the students

31:45.685 --> 31:47.269
that went in front of the
cameras after the bombing.

31:47.354 --> 31:49.105
I thought all the surviving
students were interviewed.

31:49.189 --> 31:50.473
After the initial
aftermath, yes,

31:50.557 --> 31:53.309
but these are the kids
that went on talk shows,

31:53.393 --> 31:54.894
traveled to other schools.

31:54.945 --> 31:57.029
My guess is that they didn't
self-select who made the cut.

31:57.097 --> 31:58.397
Principal Givens did.

31:58.448 --> 32:00.265
That's why the unsub
killed him first.

32:00.317 --> 32:02.101
He was an outcast
who wanted to fit in.

32:02.152 --> 32:04.236
Being a survivor should have
been his golden ticket.

32:04.287 --> 32:06.405
But he was excluded again,
and that's why he's killing them.

32:06.456 --> 32:08.374
Yeah. The rules of
high school never changed,

32:08.441 --> 32:09.742
not even after a tragedy.

32:11.628 --> 32:13.546
Go ahead, Garcia.

32:13.613 --> 32:14.454
Hey, listen up.

32:14.479 --> 32:16.298
I cross-referenced student
files with medical records.

32:16.299 --> 32:18.276
Now, there were 6 kids
that were knocked

32:18.301 --> 32:19.501
unconscious in that blast,

32:19.753 --> 32:21.921
but only one fits
the outcast profile.

32:21.972 --> 32:23.339
His name is Robert Adams,

32:23.423 --> 32:25.591
and he just used his credit card
at a local restaurant,

32:25.642 --> 32:28.677
the address of which...
I just sent you right now.

32:28.762 --> 32:30.679
I'm on my way.

32:30.764 --> 32:33.432
It was the most ridiculous thing
I've ever done in my life.

32:33.483 --> 32:35.864
I didn't want to do it,
but Jerry said we can't--

32:35.889 --> 32:37.570
well, we lost the bet.

32:37.571 --> 32:40.322
It was just very
uncomfortable for everybody.

32:50.117 --> 32:51.033
Oh, God!

32:51.118 --> 32:52.585
Oh, God.

32:52.652 --> 32:53.869
You ok?

32:53.954 --> 32:55.588
Is everybody ok?

33:03.964 --> 33:04.880
Sit down!

33:04.965 --> 33:07.550
Don't speak!

33:07.634 --> 33:09.518
Sit down!

33:11.304 --> 33:14.190
Hope I'm not
interrupting.

33:25.421 --> 33:27.506
Is it that hard,

33:27.590 --> 33:29.841
for you people

33:29.926 --> 33:33.128
to tell the truth about me?

33:33.179 --> 33:34.129
Huh?!

33:35.829 --> 33:37.830
To notice me?!

33:42.669 --> 33:44.670
Like you.

33:49.426 --> 33:52.728
Do you even know my name?

33:58.185 --> 33:59.185
Ralph?

33:59.236 --> 34:01.354
Ohh!

34:04.224 --> 34:05.658
Guess again.

34:07.110 --> 34:09.045
He's holding hostages
in the restaurant.

34:09.112 --> 34:10.763
They're clearing
the upper floors now.

34:10.831 --> 34:14.417
We got this video feed
from the security camera.

34:14.501 --> 34:17.085
Two entrances--
the front, the kitchen.

34:17.170 --> 34:18.987
Either way he can
see us coming.

34:19.056 --> 34:21.424
He's nowhere near the window,
so there's no line of sight.

34:21.507 --> 34:23.592
Yeah, but why take them
hostage at all?

34:23.677 --> 34:25.795
If this is a vendetta,
why not kill them now?

34:25.879 --> 34:28.246
We profiled this would be
like a reunion to him.

34:28.297 --> 34:30.466
He wants people
to recognize who he is.

34:30.551 --> 34:33.018
I think I know what he wants
to be recognized for.

34:34.188 --> 34:36.589
Get up. Get up!

34:36.639 --> 34:38.558
Robert Adams,
we're with the FBI.

34:38.609 --> 34:40.476
We just want
to talk to you.

34:40.561 --> 34:44.697
You better drop those guns
if you just want to talk.

34:47.818 --> 34:50.703
We know why you're
doing this, Bob.

34:51.771 --> 34:54.873
It's pretty obvious,
isn't it?

34:54.940 --> 34:58.544
Before tonight,
they didn't know my name!

34:58.612 --> 35:01.214
But now...

35:03.133 --> 35:04.500
No one will forget it.

35:04.585 --> 35:07.220
Bob, you'll be in the news
for a couple of days.

35:07.287 --> 35:09.388
But no one will know
the real story.

35:10.757 --> 35:12.675
What story is that?

35:12.759 --> 35:15.394
Tiffany...

35:15.462 --> 35:19.632
What did Randy say to the kid who
looked him in the eye?

35:20.800 --> 35:24.737
He...He said Jerry
wasn't worth a bullet.

35:24.804 --> 35:27.907
But he didn't say it
to Jerry, did he, Bob?

35:27.974 --> 35:29.775
Did he, Bob?

35:32.579 --> 35:34.163
How about you?

35:37.834 --> 35:39.485
Hmm?

35:42.789 --> 35:43.989
Don't look.

35:50.297 --> 35:52.765
No.

35:52.832 --> 35:55.101
He said it to me.

35:55.168 --> 35:58.604
I was the only one
brave enough

35:58.672 --> 35:59.939
to stare him down,

36:00.006 --> 36:01.524
but his bomb knocked me out,

36:01.608 --> 36:03.192
and when I woke up,

36:03.277 --> 36:08.314
there was Jerry on the TV
telling my story!

36:08.365 --> 36:09.649
My story!

36:09.700 --> 36:12.034
And nobody got to find out

36:12.119 --> 36:14.320
that Bob Adams
was a good kid.

36:14.371 --> 36:18.658
A brave kid. The kind of kid
you'd want to hang out with.

36:19.993 --> 36:22.211
We can give you back
your story, Bob,

36:22.296 --> 36:23.696
but you have to drop the gun.

36:30.804 --> 36:35.391
Isn't it funny
when your dream comes true...

36:35.475 --> 36:39.211
It's never the way you want.

36:39.262 --> 36:40.813
Drop the gun.
Bob.

36:49.856 --> 36:52.241
Morgan, he's heading
to the south entrance.

36:52.326 --> 36:53.743
Copy. I got
the back covered.

37:16.850 --> 37:18.384
He's going in
the boiler room.

37:18.435 --> 37:20.102
I'm on my way.

38:19.279 --> 38:21.146
FBI. Drop the weapon, Bob.

38:30.590 --> 38:33.092
- Hotch!
- Prentiss, in here!

38:33.159 --> 38:34.827
We need medical
in the boiler room.

38:36.096 --> 38:38.347
Hold your fire.

38:38.432 --> 38:41.967
That...Didn't...Hurt!

38:42.018 --> 38:44.770
Uhh! Aah!

38:58.401 --> 39:00.319
"Pain is
the breaking of the shell

39:00.370 --> 39:02.688
that encloses your
understanding."

39:02.739 --> 39:04.657
Kahlil Gibran.

39:12.916 --> 39:14.366
We interrupt
your regularly scheduled

39:14.417 --> 39:16.702
musical selection with
an important announcement.

39:16.753 --> 39:20.222
Never wage a practical joke war
against an M.I.T. graduate,

39:20.307 --> 39:21.707
because we have a history
of going nuclear.

39:21.758 --> 39:24.376
Now sit back, relax,
and enjoy the dulcet sounds

39:24.427 --> 39:26.145
of me screaming in your ear.

39:26.212 --> 39:29.381
Aaaah!

39:29.432 --> 39:31.049
Ok, kid, that was cute.

39:31.101 --> 39:32.485
But that's all you got?

39:38.692 --> 39:39.608
Hey, baby gi--

39:39.693 --> 39:43.028
Aaaah!

39:44.364 --> 39:45.397
Uh-uh.

39:45.448 --> 39:47.366
All right, Reid, it's on.

39:47.417 --> 39:50.035
Just know that paybacks
are a bitch.

39:53.406 --> 39:55.407
- Hey.
- Hey.

39:56.409 --> 39:59.244
How's Jack?

39:59.296 --> 40:02.247
I just had a feeling.

40:02.299 --> 40:05.234
There's a kid that's
being mean to him at school,

40:05.302 --> 40:08.152
and Jack's solution
is to invite him over

40:08.177 --> 40:09.377
and make friends with him.

40:09.456 --> 40:11.223
Ohh...

40:11.274 --> 40:13.926
That is the sweetest

40:13.977 --> 40:16.278
and saddest thing I've heard.

40:16.363 --> 40:17.813
How did you find out?

40:17.898 --> 40:19.264
His teacher told me.

40:19.316 --> 40:21.066
Jack didn't tell you?

40:21.134 --> 40:23.102
Oh, that must be hard.

40:23.169 --> 40:25.404
He wants to solve it himself.

40:25.455 --> 40:27.289
And you want to let him.

40:27.374 --> 40:29.625
But there's probably
a part of you

40:29.709 --> 40:31.911
that wishes you could
step in.

40:31.962 --> 40:35.047
Well, there's a part of me
that wants to protect him

40:35.114 --> 40:37.666
from everything that could
hurt him, but I know I can't.

40:37.751 --> 40:40.469
No.

40:40.554 --> 40:43.956
But you can show him that he
doesn't have to face it alone.

40:47.126 --> 40:49.311
How did you get by
in Paris?

40:49.396 --> 40:52.898
Um, I, um...

40:52.966 --> 40:56.318
I played a lot
of online scrabble...

40:56.403 --> 41:00.990
With some girl named
Cheeto Breath.

41:15.321 --> 41:17.923
At this time, we'd like you
to call out names of people

41:17.991 --> 41:19.425
who were hurt or died,

41:19.492 --> 41:21.794
people you'd like
to remember.

41:24.798 --> 41:26.999
Jerry Holtz.

41:28.301 --> 41:31.470
Jay O'Brien.

41:31.521 --> 41:34.056
Steve Tossell.

41:34.140 --> 41:36.725
Tucker Cranwell.

41:36.810 --> 41:38.727
Allison Humwald.

41:38.812 --> 41:41.397
Janine Bergen.

41:41.481 --> 41:43.949
Natalie Gallo.

41:44.017 --> 41:46.151
Randy Slade.

42:01.001 --> 42:02.835
Why are we doing this?

42:02.886 --> 42:04.386
We haven't talked
to mom in a while,

42:04.471 --> 42:07.756
so I thought it would
be a good idea if we did it again.

42:07.841 --> 42:10.876
But I don't want
to make you sad.

42:10.927 --> 42:13.896
Buddy, you're not
making me sad.

42:13.980 --> 42:15.564
It makes me happy,

42:15.649 --> 42:18.651
because it reminds me what a
great job mom did with you.

42:18.718 --> 42:22.187
So maybe if we got in the habit
of doing this again,

42:22.238 --> 42:24.239
you know,
mom could help us.

42:24.324 --> 42:25.791
Like with what?

42:25.859 --> 42:30.362
You know,
if you have a bad day.

42:30.413 --> 42:33.332
Mrs. McKee said
Paul's been mean to you.

42:33.399 --> 42:36.502
He hasn't been mean to me.

42:36.569 --> 42:38.504
No?

42:40.507 --> 42:42.091
Ok.

42:42.175 --> 42:44.760
Well, mom, look out
for Jack anyway.

42:46.513 --> 42:47.963
Dad, too.

42:48.048 --> 42:50.516
Oh, dad, too.
Of course.

42:54.437 --> 42:55.971
Good job.

42:56.056 --> 42:58.474
Ok. Time
to settle down.

43:03.596 --> 43:05.064
Good night, buddy.

43:05.115 --> 43:06.899
Love you, Dad.

43:08.902 --> 43:11.203
I love you, too.
