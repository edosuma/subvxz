WEBVTT

02:08.419 --> 02:10.421
Fuckin' shit!

02:13.842 --> 02:15.218
Are you insane, Johnny?

02:15.301 --> 02:17.512
Listen! I can't fix it!

02:17.595 --> 02:19.681
You'll crash if nothing's done!

02:21.307 --> 02:22.517
Oh, I get it.

02:22.600 --> 02:23.935
You are insane!

02:27.105 --> 02:29.566
The plane's wiring has been fried.

02:29.649 --> 02:30.942
It can't be fixed.

02:31.025 --> 02:32.402
We'll crash if nothing's done!

02:40.243 --> 02:42.579
The only thing
that can stop it is this guy's power.

02:43.413 --> 02:45.456
If we crash, I won't die.

02:45.540 --> 02:47.083
I'm a ghost, after all.

02:47.750 --> 02:50.712
And if we can't use his power,
we don't need him.

02:52.589 --> 02:55.049
If you guys want to live,
tell me the code.

03:24.996 --> 03:26.247
Mission accomplished!

03:27.999 --> 03:29.500
-All right!
-All right!

03:30.001 --> 03:31.336
Yes! We did it!

03:38.259 --> 03:42.305
Sorry. It's been a while,
so my control is a little shaky.

03:52.023 --> 03:55.276
What? I thought we were a lot higher.

03:55.944 --> 03:57.445
We almost hit the ground.

03:59.113 --> 04:01.407
Plan C was a total success.

04:01.491 --> 04:04.285
Exactly according to my plan.

04:04.369 --> 04:06.621
Johnny's the one who came up with it.

04:06.704 --> 04:08.831
Johnny? You mean Johnny Bolt?

04:08.915 --> 04:10.833
Hey, McCabe!

04:11.542 --> 04:13.044
We've come for you, my brother!

04:13.127 --> 04:15.463
Follow my airplane.

04:15.546 --> 04:18.424
You bums,
this is where the real fun begins!

04:33.481 --> 04:37.110
You all did quite well
in the rescue of TK.

04:37.944 --> 04:41.656
But that was nothing more than
the first half of this job.

04:41.739 --> 04:43.741
Quit lecturing, gramps!

04:43.825 --> 04:45.785
Hurry up and tell us
about the second half!

04:45.868 --> 04:48.788
One more person will be joining us.

04:48.871 --> 04:50.039
One more? Who?

04:50.123 --> 04:52.166
Obviously, just another obscure villain.

04:52.250 --> 04:54.627
Don't look at me when you say that!

04:55.211 --> 04:57.213
He'll be here soon.

04:57.297 --> 04:59.048
TK. Here!

05:07.140 --> 05:11.894
This job is
the riskiest job I've ever attempted.

05:11.978 --> 05:14.897
But the reward is also the greatest.

05:14.981 --> 05:18.693
It will become legendary
in the history of villains.

05:18.776 --> 05:20.028
I'm in!

05:20.111 --> 05:20.987
Shut up!

05:21.571 --> 05:22.447
Continue.

05:22.530 --> 05:26.659
Of course,
I've made the perfect plan, as always.

05:27.243 --> 05:31.039
In other words, somebody else will
come up with plan C at the last second.

05:31.622 --> 05:33.416
You can do it this time.

05:33.499 --> 05:37.378
If there are holes in the plan,
then we can fill them in on the fly.

05:38.296 --> 05:40.673
So, Carmine, when is it?

05:41.674 --> 05:42.675
Tomorrow.

05:43.259 --> 05:44.594
-Tomorrow?
-Tomorrow?

05:48.264 --> 05:50.141
I don't have a change of clothes.

05:50.224 --> 05:52.226
I haven't changed in three days.

05:52.310 --> 05:53.686
I haven't in five.

05:54.520 --> 05:57.815
To do this job,
we'll need all eight of us.

05:57.899 --> 06:00.777
I want you to decide right here and now

06:02.070 --> 06:03.404
if you'll participate.

06:04.822 --> 06:07.492
Carmine, I want you to know this now.

06:07.575 --> 06:11.788
If I don't think it'll succeed,
I won't join, even if the seven others do.

06:11.871 --> 06:15.750
You're like family to me, but villains
can't operate based on feelings alone.

06:15.833 --> 06:17.126
Of course!

06:17.210 --> 06:20.254
Anyway, let's listen
to what he has to say.

06:20.338 --> 06:24.675
Gramps, what is it
that Romanian sugar daddy wants?

06:25.176 --> 06:26.010
What's our target?

06:26.594 --> 06:29.180
You're looking at the target.

06:29.764 --> 06:30.890
What?

06:38.523 --> 06:43.319
We're not robbing this bar, are we?
There's hardly any money here at all.

06:46.572 --> 06:49.117
Carmine, have you lost your mind?

06:51.160 --> 06:52.495
Kasey, you know what it is?

06:52.578 --> 06:54.914
What are we breaking into?

07:03.714 --> 07:04.549
What?

07:04.632 --> 07:06.759
Jeez. What a waste of my time.

07:06.843 --> 07:07.718
What?

07:08.386 --> 07:09.887
Gramps has finally lost it.

07:09.971 --> 07:13.015
Shut up! Don't think about anything!
We're outta here.

07:16.602 --> 07:17.937
Are you nuts?

07:18.646 --> 07:21.774
Breaking into superhero HQ
amounts to nothing short of suicide!

07:21.858 --> 07:24.610
Cut it out, Josh! Empty your mind.

07:25.319 --> 07:26.154
Let's go.

07:27.697 --> 07:29.615
I'm off this team too.

07:31.868 --> 07:37.206
Brainwave, one of the superhero members
of The Union of Justice,

07:37.290 --> 07:40.334
can read people's minds
over short distances.

07:40.418 --> 07:41.919
Shut up, gramps!

07:42.003 --> 07:43.504
If you want to die, then do it alone!

07:44.088 --> 07:45.715
Cut it out, Josh! Carmine knows--

07:45.798 --> 07:50.470
From over there, he would most certainly
be able to hear my thoughts.

07:51.053 --> 07:53.973
Surely, he would get here
in less than a minute.

07:58.519 --> 07:59.896
Are you all right, man?

08:00.605 --> 08:03.691
How am I not supposed
to think about anything?

08:05.401 --> 08:08.154
Carmine, if you have an idea,
then out with it.

08:08.237 --> 08:11.157
Brainwave isn't there.

08:14.368 --> 08:19.081
The spectacular Brainwave was selected
as one of 50 Heroes to End War

08:19.165 --> 08:23.753
and departed New York yesterday
for the awards ceremony in Beijing.

08:25.755 --> 08:30.635
This award goes to specialists who work in
AI and security fields to prevent trouble,

08:30.718 --> 08:32.929
so this is a great honor.

08:33.012 --> 08:36.057
Well, I'm a fan of all the heroes.

08:36.140 --> 08:39.560
If you ever meet him in person,
he'll see right through that comment.

08:57.453 --> 08:59.413
This isn't going to let up for a while.

08:59.497 --> 09:01.415
We should have brought an umbrella.

09:02.333 --> 09:03.167
Here.

09:03.751 --> 09:04.669
Have this.

09:05.253 --> 09:06.337
Thank you!

09:06.420 --> 09:07.672
Are you sure?

09:08.714 --> 09:10.341
Are you an umbrella salesman, mister?

09:11.926 --> 09:14.887
That's a nice idea.
An umbrella salesman, huh?

09:15.513 --> 09:16.973
Uh oh! I'm gonna be late!

09:17.557 --> 09:18.891
-Have a nice day.
-Hey…

09:20.851 --> 09:22.895
You'll get wet without your umbrella.

09:22.979 --> 09:24.313
No problem.

09:24.397 --> 09:26.232
I'll be getting on the subway in a sec.

09:32.822 --> 09:33.781
McCabe.

09:33.864 --> 09:37.660
He can't get hold of the other guy,
so he'll explain the rest of the plan.

09:40.371 --> 09:42.873
Don't you think this sounds like applause?

09:43.624 --> 09:45.334
Yeah, I guess it does.

09:47.253 --> 09:48.170
What is it?

09:49.463 --> 09:51.132
You've got a light, right?

10:00.683 --> 10:02.643
At last, I got to see it.

10:02.727 --> 10:03.853
That's a useful power.

10:03.936 --> 10:06.814
Couldn't do that at Supermax though.

10:07.356 --> 10:08.649
That's all in the past.

10:09.650 --> 10:12.653
I don't even remember
when we first got to know each other.

10:14.405 --> 10:15.656
I remember.

10:21.245 --> 10:25.374
Remember when that guard
flipped his lid and killed a villain?

10:25.958 --> 10:27.501
Oh, yeah. I remember that.

10:28.085 --> 10:31.422
It was a plebe villain
who wasn't a member of the Network.

10:32.173 --> 10:34.967
The guard panicked
and just stood there frozen.

10:35.801 --> 10:38.054
It was totally silent
for about ten seconds.

10:38.846 --> 10:41.641
That's when you
suddenly started applauding.

10:44.560 --> 10:49.148
One by one, the other villains
started applauding along.

10:49.732 --> 10:51.651
In the end, there was a flood of applause.

10:53.653 --> 10:57.406
It was like you were saying,
"Congratulations! Now you're a murderer."

11:01.827 --> 11:03.287
I did that?

11:03.371 --> 11:04.205
Yeah.

11:06.707 --> 11:09.210
Watch your umbrella, you moron!

11:11.796 --> 11:13.839
New York hasn't changed one single bit.

11:15.132 --> 11:18.260
Thank goodness you didn't have
to go back to Supermax.

11:18.844 --> 11:20.763
I never wanna go back there.

11:20.846 --> 11:25.726
You won't. We'll get rich quick,
and then live a life of luxury.

11:26.894 --> 11:28.145
Applause?

11:29.355 --> 11:32.650
Ain't nobody
who wants applause from villains.

11:37.738 --> 11:40.282
We're in, man!

11:42.243 --> 11:44.245
But you haven't heard
anything about it yet.

11:44.328 --> 11:49.208
If we're raiding The Union of Justice,
there's no way we could refuse.

11:49.291 --> 11:50.584
Didn't I tell you?

11:50.668 --> 11:52.878
This is a big job that'll be legendary.

11:54.422 --> 11:55.756
Just five more people now.

11:56.424 --> 11:57.675
How about you, Johnny?

12:00.719 --> 12:04.432
I've always wanted to visit
The Union of Justice.

12:05.975 --> 12:07.601
What's our payment?

12:08.185 --> 12:09.103
Fifty million dollars.

12:09.687 --> 12:10.688
Fifty million dollars?

12:14.108 --> 12:15.276
Four left.

12:15.359 --> 12:16.777
McCabe!

12:16.861 --> 12:20.322
If each of us gets 600,000 dollars,
I can live a life of luxury!

12:20.823 --> 12:22.700
It's 6.25 million dollars each!

12:26.537 --> 12:27.413
That's plenty.

12:27.496 --> 12:31.459
We're not stealing cash
from The Union of Justice, are we?

12:32.042 --> 12:35.588
We'll be stealing the helmet
of the supervillain Count Orlok.

12:36.255 --> 12:37.214
Count…

12:37.298 --> 12:39.842
You mean the sugar daddy is Count Orlok?

12:40.426 --> 12:43.179
You younger guys probably don't know him,

12:43.262 --> 12:46.348
but he was powerful enough
to vie for being

12:46.432 --> 12:49.477
number one among supervillains
of my generation.

13:58.379 --> 14:01.257
His magical helmet
that was taken from him is

14:01.340 --> 14:06.262
still kept in the treasure vault
at The Union of Justice headquarters.

14:06.345 --> 14:09.473
Naturally, he quickly escaped from prison,

14:09.557 --> 14:12.601
but couldn't recover the helmet,
so his powers were halved.

14:13.185 --> 14:16.105
Since then,
he's been hiding out in Europe.

14:18.691 --> 14:20.985
When I heard Brainwave
would be leaving the country,

14:21.068 --> 14:23.612
I sold him on the idea right away.

14:24.113 --> 14:27.241
I thought up a plan
that he couldn't possibly refuse.

14:28.784 --> 14:29.702
Carmine.

14:31.996 --> 14:32.872
I'm in.

14:34.957 --> 14:37.376
But I'm not touching that helmet.

14:38.002 --> 14:42.756
I've heard a rumor that if anyone besides
Orlok uses it, they'll lose their mind.

14:43.799 --> 14:45.593
The payment is sufficient.

14:45.676 --> 14:47.386
The client is trustworthy.

14:47.469 --> 14:51.515
But you still haven't told us
the most crucial part, Carmine.

14:52.141 --> 14:56.770
There are other superheroes
besides Brainwave at The Union of Justice.

14:56.854 --> 15:00.774
What's more, some of them are heroes
that even Count Orlok couldn't overcome.

15:01.358 --> 15:05.613
Security is tight and it's always packed
with crowds of tourists.

15:05.696 --> 15:06.780
Of course.

15:07.406 --> 15:09.742
I've prepared the perfect plan.

15:15.539 --> 15:17.666
Excuse me, please. Pardon me.

15:20.210 --> 15:21.629
It sure is pouring rain.

15:22.421 --> 15:24.757
But the trains aren't running,
so I'm walking.

15:25.549 --> 15:26.467
What?

15:28.969 --> 15:31.388
In this rain? Is he stupid?

15:42.358 --> 15:44.902
And that's the plan.

15:44.985 --> 15:46.028
How about it, Kasey?

15:46.737 --> 15:48.405
Do you like it?

15:52.034 --> 15:53.744
Six, seven…

15:54.370 --> 15:58.916
Even the Network wouldn't try
breaking into The Union of Justice.

15:58.999 --> 16:01.794
We won't be
muscling in on their territory.

16:01.877 --> 16:06.215
In fact, rumor is that
The Bastard is preparing to retire.

16:06.715 --> 16:07.925
You sure know a lot.

16:08.008 --> 16:09.259
It's just a rumor.

16:09.343 --> 16:10.386
If we do it now,

16:10.469 --> 16:15.307
there is an extremely good chance we won't
have to pay the Network protection money.

16:15.391 --> 16:18.811
The Network doesn't even know
about any of us villains here.

16:23.399 --> 16:24.358
Kasey!

16:26.694 --> 16:29.655
Let's do this. This plan will work.

16:29.738 --> 16:31.073
We've got no choice but to do it.

16:31.156 --> 16:32.574
It's 50 million dollars.

16:32.658 --> 16:33.826
Kasey!

16:35.911 --> 16:36.745
No.

16:37.788 --> 16:38.956
Kasey!

16:39.581 --> 16:42.042
Where's the last member?

16:42.126 --> 16:46.213
It's happening tomorrow,
but he hasn't even heard the plan yet.

16:48.382 --> 16:50.467
I'll try calling him again.

16:50.551 --> 16:55.764
Unless I know that the last member is in,
I can't agree to join.

16:59.309 --> 17:02.438
Hey, Forecast! Where in the world are you?

17:02.521 --> 17:04.023
We're… What?

17:04.106 --> 17:05.232
Outside?

17:11.363 --> 17:13.157
Can you see me, Carmine?

17:13.240 --> 17:15.743
Sorry, but the trains weren't running.

17:15.826 --> 17:19.872
We're all waiting to find out
if you're in or not! Hurry up and--

17:19.955 --> 17:21.749
I'm in! I'm totally in!

17:21.832 --> 17:23.751
Thanks for inviting me!

17:23.834 --> 17:24.668
What?

17:24.752 --> 17:26.670
Fill me in on the details later.

17:27.921 --> 17:30.466
That's Forecast's power?

17:30.549 --> 17:33.093
Yeah, he can control the weather.

17:34.261 --> 17:37.056
You idiot! Don't go attracting attention!

17:39.183 --> 17:42.644
That 50 million, I think I'll take it.

17:52.362 --> 17:56.158
A big job
that even the Network isn't in on.

17:57.034 --> 17:58.452
It's electrifying!

18:01.830 --> 18:04.500
You know, I've got a little headache.

18:04.583 --> 18:06.085
Quit joking around!

18:06.168 --> 18:08.670
What if he gets upset and kills me?

18:08.754 --> 18:11.757
If you do like always,
it'll be fine. He's here!

18:39.993 --> 18:41.578
You got a death wish?

18:42.079 --> 18:43.205
I'm sorry!

18:44.665 --> 18:45.999
I'm still alive…

18:47.000 --> 18:47.835
Thank god…

19:04.059 --> 19:08.981
Every time I see it,
this place is as ugly as ever.

19:40.304 --> 19:42.222
Well, well!

20:14.004 --> 20:17.174
Ladies, gentlemen, and criminals.

20:17.966 --> 20:21.595
Thank you for coming to the party today.

20:22.179 --> 20:25.849
There's plenty of the finest
in food and wine,

20:25.933 --> 20:29.686
so enjoy yourselves
until your heads explode.

20:32.564 --> 20:35.234
I have two announcements to make today.

20:36.068 --> 20:38.237
One is written on your invitations.

20:38.320 --> 20:42.741
As of today,
I'll be retiring from the villain world.

20:43.325 --> 20:46.536
I don't want to make
a long speech about my memories,

20:46.620 --> 20:51.208
but I would like to tell you
why I became a villain.

20:51.291 --> 20:54.628
It was when I killed my own mother.

20:55.796 --> 20:59.883
But to tell the truth,
I don't remember it all that well.

21:00.384 --> 21:02.135
What I do remember is

21:02.219 --> 21:08.141
that her milk was so disgustingly awful,
I wanted to blow her brains out!

21:08.225 --> 21:11.353
I was truly a villain right from birth!

21:18.610 --> 21:21.989
The other thing is about the Network.

21:22.656 --> 21:26.159
After I step down from the Network,

21:26.243 --> 21:31.164
it will be run by
my faithful subordinates.

21:31.999 --> 21:34.501
-Here's to Mr. Matts!
-Here's to Mr. Matts!

21:35.335 --> 21:38.088
-Here's to Mr. Matts!
-Here's to Mr. Matts!

21:38.171 --> 21:41.341
Leaders will be dispatched to each region

21:41.425 --> 21:46.471
and the Network will continue
to collect 30% of revenues

21:46.555 --> 21:48.348
in the villain world.

21:49.099 --> 21:51.143
Thanks to the Network,

21:51.226 --> 21:56.231
the villain industry will remain
disciplined and prosperous forever!

22:04.865 --> 22:10.329
Find out who stops applauding first
and report to me.

22:56.416 --> 22:58.585
I thought I told you to turn that off!

22:58.668 --> 22:59.669
I'm sorry!

22:59.753 --> 23:02.255
I'm getting a headache again.

23:02.339 --> 23:03.507
It's getting worse too.

23:04.508 --> 23:06.051
Quit with the scary jokes.

23:10.889 --> 23:13.183
That was the wrong one.

24:38.393 --> 24:43.398
