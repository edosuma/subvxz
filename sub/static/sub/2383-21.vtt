WEBVTT

00:02.215 --> 00:05.316
Barney, afraid this
is good-bye.

00:05.323 --> 00:07.190
Your buzz kill of a ma

00:07.192 --> 00:09.386
thinks I'm a... a bad
influence on you.

00:09.411 --> 00:10.611
What? That's...

00:10.891 --> 00:12.457
What is that word you taught me?

00:12.459 --> 00:14.726
"Bull" something?

00:14.728 --> 00:16.545
But she's your
mother and I'm...

00:16.547 --> 00:18.930
you know, I'm just
your Uncle Jerry.

00:18.932 --> 00:21.350
So, this is the last
time I can see you.

00:21.352 --> 00:23.835
But you're supposed to
take me to see

00:23.837 --> 00:25.837
that Zeppelin cover band
next week.

00:25.839 --> 00:28.340
The night is gonna be...

00:28.342 --> 00:30.776
Led-and-Jerry.

00:30.778 --> 00:32.610
Sorry, buddy,
but this is it.

00:32.613 --> 00:35.013
But don't you forget
your training.

00:35.015 --> 00:36.732
What's a magician's best friend?

00:36.734 --> 00:37.816
A drunk audience.

00:37.818 --> 00:39.184
Attaboy.

00:39.186 --> 00:42.738
You still got that button
from the festival we went to?

00:46.893 --> 00:50.195
Now... I'm gonna put this

00:50.197 --> 00:52.197
right inside your brain,
behind your ear...

00:54.000 --> 00:56.435
so that I'll know that
you won't forget me.

00:58.171 --> 00:59.337
See you, buddy.

01:00.539 --> 01:02.741
And hey...

01:02.743 --> 01:06.678
Never... stop... partying.

01:09.282 --> 01:12.484
<i>Kids, in 1983,</i>
<i>Barney watched his father</i>

01:12.486 --> 01:13.952
<i>walk out of his life.</i>

01:13.954 --> 01:17.689
<i>And in 2011, when their</i>
<i>first reunion ended badly...</i>

01:17.691 --> 01:20.358
I'd love nothing more
than to be a part of your life.

01:20.360 --> 01:22.227
<i>This time it was Barney</i>
<i>who did the walking.</i>

01:22.229 --> 01:23.528
Bye.

01:23.530 --> 01:26.164
<i>And that was almost</i>
<i>the end of it.</i>

01:26.166 --> 01:28.100
<i>Except, a few weeks later...</i>

01:28.102 --> 01:31.636
I am so angry at my dad!

01:31.638 --> 01:33.572
Guess who called me today.

01:33.574 --> 01:35.907
Go on, guess.
Mmm.

01:35.909 --> 01:38.243
Your dad?
My dad!

01:38.245 --> 01:40.445
Barney Stinson.

01:40.447 --> 01:41.747
Hi, Barney. It's your dad.

01:42.615 --> 01:43.682
Look, would you
like to go fishing

01:43.684 --> 01:45.283
with me and J.J.
on Sunday morning?

01:45.285 --> 01:48.186
Ooh, hold on, let me
check my personality.

01:48.188 --> 01:50.789
Oh, no. Turns out I would never
do that in a million years.

01:50.791 --> 01:52.724
Barney, look...

01:52.726 --> 01:55.060
I know you're disappointed
that your dad is just...

01:55.062 --> 01:57.929
a boring old driving instructor
from the suburbs.

01:57.931 --> 02:01.533
But that guy I used to be--
"Crazy Jerry"?

02:01.535 --> 02:03.468
He was bad news!

02:03.470 --> 02:05.904
Drinking, partying,
sleeping around.

02:05.906 --> 02:08.406
The party can't go on forever.

02:08.407 --> 02:11.409
You're 35; I'm-I'm sure
you're starting

02:11.411 --> 02:12.878
to realize that, right?

02:12.880 --> 02:16.615
You do not know
how right you are.

02:16.617 --> 02:17.949
Zero right!

02:17.951 --> 02:20.585
We're not getting too old for anything.
You sure?

02:20.587 --> 02:23.088
I feel like we collectively
learn the opposite lesson,

02:23.090 --> 02:24.589
like, at least once a year.

02:25.759 --> 02:27.793
I have to face an ugly truth.

02:27.795 --> 02:31.096
Jerry Whittaker, my own father,

02:31.098 --> 02:33.465
is anti-awesome-etic.

02:34.200 --> 02:35.367
I know

02:35.369 --> 02:37.235
Crazy Jerry's still
in there somewhere,

02:37.237 --> 02:40.572
but he's trapped under 20 years
of lawnmower parties

02:40.574 --> 02:42.741
and carpool barbecues.
Wow,

02:42.743 --> 02:44.810
you know nothing
about the suburbs.

02:44.812 --> 02:47.813
Well, this Saturday night,
I am bustin' him out.

02:47.815 --> 02:48.880
I'm gonna

02:48.882 --> 02:50.649
make Jerry realize he was wrong

02:50.651 --> 02:53.552
about giving up his old life
by showing him

02:53.554 --> 02:56.788
the awesomest night
of all time.

02:56.790 --> 02:58.423
And for the awesomest night

02:58.425 --> 03:02.928
of all time, I'm going to need
the awesomest friends

03:02.930 --> 03:04.162
of all time.

03:06.232 --> 03:07.833
Okay, who do I know?

03:11.404 --> 03:13.038
Guys...!

03:14.640 --> 03:16.641
Do any of you know
George Clooney?

03:17.727 --> 03:19.110
Okay, my dad's almost here.

03:19.112 --> 03:20.412
I need everything to be

03:20.414 --> 03:22.531
as awesome as possible tonight.

03:22.533 --> 03:24.049
That's why you
brought these guys.

03:24.051 --> 03:28.019
No. That's why
I brought <i>these</i> guys.

03:28.021 --> 03:29.020
I've made some

03:29.022 --> 03:30.622
minor improvements
to your identities.

03:30.624 --> 03:31.756
Uh.
Mm!

03:31.758 --> 03:32.924
You'll find them
on these cards.

03:32.926 --> 03:33.992
Improvements?!
Yeah.

03:33.994 --> 03:36.878
Bro, we are
already the four

03:36.880 --> 03:40.498
jiggity-jamminest dudes
and dudettes this side of...

03:40.500 --> 03:42.651
Okay, let's see the cards.

03:42.653 --> 03:44.102
Robin, no one watches the news

03:44.104 --> 03:46.338
unless it's a car chase
or a nip slip.

03:46.340 --> 03:47.205
You are now

03:47.207 --> 03:48.723
a professional scotch taster.

03:48.725 --> 03:49.875
Mm!

03:49.877 --> 03:51.743
Lily, Jerry needs to learn
that other lifestyles

03:51.745 --> 03:53.311
are just as fulfilling
as monogamy,

03:53.313 --> 03:55.714
so now you and Marshall
are in an open marriage.

03:55.716 --> 03:57.983
Whoo-hoo!
Gross!

03:57.985 --> 04:00.385
Also, Marshall,
you can't just be unemployed,

04:00.387 --> 04:01.553
so you are now

04:01.555 --> 04:04.189
a gin-swilling,
womanizing playwright.

04:05.024 --> 04:07.425
And, Ted, just be yourself.

04:08.461 --> 04:10.061
Just kidding.

04:10.063 --> 04:13.198
Here's a giant pile of topics
you should avoid talking about.

04:13.200 --> 04:15.433
Well. Well, this could
actually be fun.

04:15.435 --> 04:18.536
In fact, I believe it
was Oscar Wilde who said,

04:18.538 --> 04:21.172
"Man is least himself
when he talks..."

04:21.173 --> 04:22.340
Ted, card.
Ah.

04:22.342 --> 04:24.976
You're right--
"No quoting Oscar Wilde."

04:24.978 --> 04:26.478
Finally...

04:26.480 --> 04:28.146
Robin, you're dating Ted.

04:28.148 --> 04:29.547
Aw, man!

04:29.549 --> 04:30.949
Why?

04:30.951 --> 04:32.183
I can't have

04:32.185 --> 04:33.985
any single female friends
lying around.

04:33.987 --> 04:36.488
My dad'll be all,
"Why don't you marry Robin?

04:36.490 --> 04:37.989
"You guys are cute together.
Deep down, you know

04:37.991 --> 04:40.759
you were never happier
than when you were with her."

04:40.761 --> 04:41.860
Uh...

04:41.862 --> 04:43.228
no, thanks.

04:43.230 --> 04:45.030
Hey, Barney-- love
the new identities.

04:45.032 --> 04:48.266
Little thing-- instead of
being a naked super ninja,

04:48.268 --> 04:51.836
can I be Meryl Streep
in <i>The Devil Wears Prada?</i>

04:51.838 --> 04:54.105
How good was that movie?
Oh, my God.

04:56.076 --> 04:57.175
And...

04:57.177 --> 04:59.945
hence new identities.

05:01.213 --> 05:04.249
<i>And so Barney's dad</i>
<i>finally showed up.</i>

05:04.251 --> 05:06.551
Jerry, you remember Marshall--
he's a well-known writer.

05:06.553 --> 05:07.919
Playwright.
We're all writers,

05:07.921 --> 05:11.006
just some of us don't know
what our story is yet.

05:11.724 --> 05:13.791
Lily, his wife.

05:13.793 --> 05:15.961
Well, most nights.
Mama don't let no ring

05:15.963 --> 05:18.029
get in the way of a good time.

05:18.031 --> 05:19.931
That's... a
little depressing.

05:19.933 --> 05:21.066
Uh, hi again.

05:21.068 --> 05:22.167
Ted. Oh, and, Jerry,

05:22.169 --> 05:24.319
you remember my girlfriend.
Robin. Hi.

05:24.321 --> 05:26.471
So nice to see you again.

05:26.473 --> 05:28.273
Wait, wait. Jerry,

05:28.275 --> 05:29.674
I got to tell you
the truth.

05:29.676 --> 05:30.875
Guys, I'm gonna tell him.

05:31.677 --> 05:33.311
We're also a band.

05:33.313 --> 05:34.946

So, Saturday night--
time to cut loose, right?

05:53.833 --> 05:55.633
Who wants to split a beer?

05:55.635 --> 05:57.335
Oh, we're not drinking here.

05:57.337 --> 05:58.970
Tonight we're going big.

05:58.972 --> 06:01.606
Let's see, what club
should we hit first?

06:01.608 --> 06:04.242
There's Club Was,
there's Wrong...

06:04.244 --> 06:06.578
Um, those places shut
down a long time ago.

06:06.580 --> 06:07.245
Oh, no.

06:07.247 --> 06:08.279
Oh, No shut down, too.

06:08.281 --> 06:09.881
There's Where?
Where's Where?

06:09.883 --> 06:11.349
Where's where Was
was, isn't it?

06:11.351 --> 06:14.119
No, Was wasn't where Where was,
Was was where Wrong was, right?

06:14.121 --> 06:16.221
Okay. Not Okay.
That place is lame.

06:16.223 --> 06:18.723
Okay is Lame?
I thought Lame was a gay bar.

06:18.725 --> 06:19.758
Or is that Wrong?

06:19.760 --> 06:21.626
That's wrong.
That's not Wrong.

06:21.628 --> 06:22.560
Guys, focus.

06:22.562 --> 06:24.028
Oh, I like Focus.
Let's go there.

06:24.030 --> 06:25.730
Where?
Not Where. Focus.

06:25.732 --> 06:27.232
I thought Focus
was closed.

06:27.234 --> 06:28.400
No, Was was Closed.

06:28.402 --> 06:30.835
Once Was shut down,
it reopened as Closed.

06:30.837 --> 06:31.870
So Closed is open.

06:31.872 --> 06:32.771
No, Closed is closed.

06:32.773 --> 06:33.772
I don't know.

06:33.774 --> 06:35.540
Third base! Right?

06:35.542 --> 06:37.375
Ew, Third Base
is all frat guys.

06:37.377 --> 06:38.543
I'll go anyplace, okay?

06:38.545 --> 06:40.578
Not Okay. Okay is lame.

06:40.580 --> 06:41.730
Okay is not Lame.

06:41.732 --> 06:43.214
Lame is a gay bar.

06:43.216 --> 06:44.115
Guys, shut up.

06:44.117 --> 06:45.450
No, Shut up shut down.

06:45.452 --> 06:48.319
I can't believe I don't
know the clubs anymore.

06:48.321 --> 06:50.422
Guys, just pick
a club, okay?

06:50.424 --> 06:52.023
Not Okay!

06:52.025 --> 06:53.291
Okay is Lame!

06:53.293 --> 06:55.493
Gay bar.

06:55.495 --> 06:58.730
For the record, I was in
there once by accident.

06:58.732 --> 07:01.633
I'm pretty sure it's
pronounced Lamé.

07:01.635 --> 07:04.536
It's hopeless, isn't it?

07:04.538 --> 07:06.904
<i>Wow.</i>

07:06.906 --> 07:08.840
A lot of these girls
are young enough

07:08.842 --> 07:10.408
to be our daughters.
I know.

07:10.410 --> 07:12.076
Daddy's home.

07:12.078 --> 07:14.245
And Granddaddy's home!

07:15.047 --> 07:16.815
Tonight rocks so hard!

07:16.817 --> 07:19.384
I might be allergic
to this stamp.

07:23.689 --> 07:25.857
Oh, my God,
my secret crush is here.

07:25.859 --> 07:26.825
Mila Kunis?!

07:26.827 --> 07:29.594
No, <i>my</i> secret crush.

07:29.596 --> 07:32.397
We met a few
years ago.

07:34.467 --> 07:37.302
Hi. I could use
a woman's opinion.

07:37.304 --> 07:40.004
Is this working for me?

07:40.006 --> 07:41.639
Uh... no.

07:42.576 --> 07:43.625
The only good thing

07:43.627 --> 07:45.109
about how ugly that shirt is,

07:45.111 --> 07:48.847
is that it distracts
from how terribly it fits you.

07:48.849 --> 07:50.915
I was trying on the pants.

07:50.917 --> 07:52.917
Oh.

07:53.652 --> 07:55.170
I had to leave
before we could

07:55.172 --> 07:56.521
finish talking,
so that was it.

07:56.523 --> 07:57.722
You know, ever
since then, I've...

07:57.724 --> 07:59.991
Oh, my God, he's
coming over here.

07:59.993 --> 08:01.259
Oh. Hello.

08:01.261 --> 08:03.695
Hi. A few years ago at a
department store, Hi.

08:03.697 --> 08:05.597
did you embarrass
the hell out of me?

08:05.599 --> 08:08.266
Oh, I'm sorry,
you must have me confused

08:08.268 --> 08:11.436
with the shirt
you were wearing that day.

08:11.438 --> 08:13.137
I should be so lucky.

08:13.139 --> 08:14.906
Hi! I'm Ted!

08:14.908 --> 08:16.524
Robin's boyfriend!

08:16.526 --> 08:17.842
Nice to meet you.

08:17.844 --> 08:19.310
Right.

08:19.312 --> 08:21.746
Um... it was really nice
to see you again.

08:21.748 --> 08:23.615
Mm-hmm. You, too.
Yeah.

08:24.618 --> 08:26.868
You owe me one.

08:28.120 --> 08:29.554
Man, isn't this
place great?

08:29.556 --> 08:32.157
Uh, I don't know.
It's so loud!

08:32.159 --> 08:33.491
And so bourgeois.

08:33.493 --> 08:36.628
Many of plays are
about the bourgeois.

08:37.328 --> 08:38.395
And ennui.

08:39.198 --> 08:42.500
And one rock opera about...

08:42.501 --> 08:44.903
a frozen yogurt shop.

08:46.839 --> 08:49.674
Uh, L-Lily, uh, talk
about your open marriage.

08:49.676 --> 08:53.478
Okay. Well, after a long day
of style meetings

08:53.480 --> 08:55.180
and photo shoots

08:55.182 --> 08:56.447
and being
way too mean

08:56.449 --> 08:57.565
to my assistant,

08:57.567 --> 09:00.552
I sometimes bang
an underwear model.

09:00.554 --> 09:01.419
My goodness!

09:01.421 --> 09:02.554
I sleep around, too.

09:02.556 --> 09:03.821
Just as much.

09:03.823 --> 09:05.089
A little more, even.

09:05.091 --> 09:07.858
Oh, uh, only 'cause you
have nothing to do all day.

09:07.860 --> 09:09.427
Are we having
this fight again?

09:09.429 --> 09:11.196
Writing plays is a real job!

09:11.198 --> 09:14.832
I work 90 hours a week
subsidizing your "real job."

09:14.834 --> 09:15.967
I won a Tony!

09:15.969 --> 09:18.336
I brought French cooking
to America!

09:18.338 --> 09:20.104
What?

09:20.106 --> 09:22.941
Let's do shots.
Uh, no, thank you, Barney.

09:22.943 --> 09:25.743
I have that fishing
trip with J.J. early tomorrow.

09:25.745 --> 09:28.179
I-I better take it easy.
No.

09:28.181 --> 09:30.648
Don't you remember what you said
to me when I was a kid?

09:30.650 --> 09:32.984
"Never stop partying."

09:32.986 --> 09:34.485
I said <i>that?</i>

09:34.487 --> 09:36.287
To a six-year-old?

09:36.922 --> 09:37.989
I don't remember that.

09:37.991 --> 09:39.557
You don't remember
the last thing

09:39.559 --> 09:41.960
you said to me when I was a kid?

09:42.895 --> 09:43.995
Well...

09:43.997 --> 09:45.997
you know, why don't you
just go back home?

09:45.999 --> 09:47.615
But I want to hang out with you.

09:47.617 --> 09:49.934
Yeah, well, I want to hang out
with Crazy Jerry,

09:49.936 --> 09:52.270
not Stay-at-Home Jerome.

09:52.272 --> 09:54.439
Fine.

09:54.441 --> 09:56.274
You want Crazy Jerry?

09:58.000 --> 10:04.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

10:06.385 --> 10:10.488
There! You got him!

10:13.759 --> 10:17.028
I apologize-- it might take
a few minutes to kick in.

10:17.030 --> 10:18.263
Oh...
Oh...

10:23.320 --> 10:26.987
Hey, sugar!
Five beers for the table,

10:27.080 --> 10:28.580
a Seven-and-Seven for me,

10:28.582 --> 10:31.216
and your ten digits
for this guy here!

10:31.218 --> 10:35.437
Tonight Crazy Jerry's
gonna burn this disco down!

10:35.439 --> 10:37.822
Whoo! Wa-hah!

10:37.824 --> 10:39.190
Can you believe it?

10:39.192 --> 10:40.792
This is awesome!
Barney,

10:40.794 --> 10:43.294
how is <i>that</i> awesome?

10:43.296 --> 10:46.631
♪ ♪

10:46.633 --> 10:50.602
I finally know what it's like
to be embarrassed by my dad.

10:51.370 --> 10:52.470
So you really believe

10:52.472 --> 10:54.873
that if we were in
an open marriage

10:54.875 --> 10:57.175
that you would do better than me?
Hey,

10:57.177 --> 10:59.761
you do better than me
at a lot of other things,

10:59.763 --> 11:01.579
like digesting dairy...

11:01.581 --> 11:04.048
and reaching for stuff.

11:04.050 --> 11:05.283
Okay, you know what?

11:05.285 --> 11:06.451
Game on.

11:06.453 --> 11:09.320
If I can score five
numbers before you can,

11:09.322 --> 11:11.589
then we have sex
in the bathroom.

11:11.591 --> 11:12.691
But...

11:12.693 --> 11:15.160
if you can score
five numbers before me,

11:15.162 --> 11:17.729
then we have sex
in the bathroom.

11:17.731 --> 11:18.963
So our usual wager.

11:19.465 --> 11:21.032
Deal.

11:23.285 --> 11:24.669
Hey, uh, hey, Jerry,

11:24.671 --> 11:27.038
y-you really want to be
out here like this?

11:27.040 --> 11:29.090
Oh, sorry, small-town preacher
from the Midwest,

11:29.092 --> 11:32.243
is there a law against dancing?

11:32.245 --> 11:34.095
No, of course not.
I-I just...

11:34.097 --> 11:35.296
Oh, this club blows.

11:35.298 --> 11:37.582
Let's hit the greatest
party in the world,

11:37.584 --> 11:39.350
the streets of New York!

11:39.352 --> 11:41.419
Yeah! Let's do it!
Yeah!

11:41.421 --> 11:44.255
Uh, maybe fix the tie.

11:44.257 --> 11:46.424
But mostly, party!

11:47.977 --> 11:49.644
Okay, Jerry's gone;
let's break up.

11:49.646 --> 11:52.597
Okay. "I would have stolen you
a whole orchestra."

11:52.599 --> 11:54.065
There. What's the rush?

11:54.067 --> 11:56.601
Well, that guy who came over
here who thinks we're dating,

11:56.603 --> 11:58.036
I kind of have
a crush on him.

11:58.038 --> 11:59.270
Can you help me
clear it up?

11:59.272 --> 12:00.772
Really? That guy?

12:00.774 --> 12:02.240
He was, like, a four.

12:02.242 --> 12:06.377
A four? God, you are, like,
the worst judge of guys ever.

12:06.379 --> 12:08.975
Okay, if he is a
four, what are you?

12:08.976 --> 12:09.751
Hey!

12:09.850 --> 12:12.050
I'm not perfect;
I'm an eight...

12:12.052 --> 12:13.918
and a half.

12:13.920 --> 12:15.920
You're a doofus and a half.

12:15.922 --> 12:17.589
Fine. Let's go talk to him.

12:17.591 --> 12:19.424
Where'd you meet
this booger-eater anyway?

12:19.426 --> 12:21.893
At a close-out
sale at Dawes.

12:21.895 --> 12:23.928
Really?
I remember that sale.

12:24.730 --> 12:25.797
Hey, Robin.

12:25.799 --> 12:27.532
Oh, Ted. Oh, no.

12:27.534 --> 12:29.200
Look what I just bought.

12:29.202 --> 12:32.237
Right? Right?

12:32.239 --> 12:34.839
Hold on.
We were dating then.

12:34.841 --> 12:36.207
I specifically remember,

12:36.209 --> 12:38.576
because we had great
sex that night.

12:38.578 --> 12:40.945
Great sex.

12:41.814 --> 12:43.031
Let me guess.

12:43.033 --> 12:44.382
Someone wants to knock...

12:44.384 --> 12:46.851
boots.

12:48.420 --> 12:49.454
Boots.

12:49.456 --> 12:51.523
Just take off your damn shirt.
Okay.

12:51.525 --> 12:52.874
All right.

12:52.876 --> 12:54.592
All right. Whoa,

12:54.594 --> 12:55.844
stop.
What?

12:55.846 --> 12:57.095
Stop. Perfect.

12:57.097 --> 12:59.631
But I-I can't see,
and you can't see me.

12:59.633 --> 13:03.134
Yeah. Yeah, just like that.

13:03.136 --> 13:05.970
You were picturing your crush!
Well,

13:05.972 --> 13:08.039
<i>somebody</i> had to.

13:09.909 --> 13:12.777
Okay, okay, answer me this.

13:12.779 --> 13:16.514
Are you absolutely sure
it had nothing whatsoever...

13:16.516 --> 13:18.850
to do with the boots?

13:18.852 --> 13:20.418
Yes.

13:21.587 --> 13:22.620
You hear that, everybody?

13:22.622 --> 13:25.223
She said "yes"!
We're getting married!

13:26.293 --> 13:27.458
I love this girl.

13:27.460 --> 13:29.127
I'm never letting her go.

13:35.035 --> 13:37.919
Hey... Bottoms up, amigo!

13:37.921 --> 13:39.554
<i>After that,</i>

13:39.556 --> 13:42.173
<i>Barney's memory of the night</i>
<i>got a little hazy.</i>

13:42.175 --> 13:44.008
You want to fight me?

13:44.777 --> 13:48.980
Well, I'll fight you, dummy!

13:48.982 --> 13:51.182
You don't even know!

13:51.184 --> 13:53.017
Hey, hey! There we go!

13:58.791 --> 14:01.192
Oh, look what I just ripped
out of the ground!

14:01.194 --> 14:02.827
Oh...!

14:04.197 --> 14:06.798
I just puked on the
hood of that...

14:06.800 --> 14:09.334
...police car!

14:12.433 --> 14:14.001
Too bad your
playwright friend

14:14.039 --> 14:15.999
isn't a lawyer.

14:20.726 --> 14:22.562
Barney, I'm so sorry.

14:23.503 --> 14:24.870
I'm afraid this
is what it's like

14:24.890 --> 14:27.090
hanging out with
Crazy Jerry.

14:28.158 --> 14:30.692
It's okay, Dad.

14:30.694 --> 14:34.830
I never thought tonight
would be so awesome!

14:34.832 --> 14:36.097
So...

14:36.099 --> 14:37.866
next stop, strip club.

14:37.868 --> 14:39.734
The Lusty Leopard
has a special...

14:39.736 --> 14:42.170
Oh, for corn's sake,
Barney, I'm not drunk!

14:42.172 --> 14:43.572
What?
I told you,

14:43.574 --> 14:44.906
I don't party anymore,

14:44.908 --> 14:47.275
and you wouldn't take
no for an answer.

14:47.277 --> 14:48.343
So...

14:48.345 --> 14:52.180
<i>I used a little...</i>
<i>sleight-of-hand...</i>

14:53.549 --> 14:56.818
...to make you think otherwise.

14:56.820 --> 14:58.170
Here you go.

14:58.172 --> 14:59.988
Whoa!

14:59.990 --> 15:02.190
Bottoms up, amigo!

15:03.677 --> 15:05.093
Mm.

15:05.095 --> 15:07.662
But all those
crazy things you did.

15:07.664 --> 15:11.299
Do you happen to remember what
a magician's best friend is?

15:12.168 --> 15:14.969
A drunk audience.

15:14.971 --> 15:17.539
You want to fight me?

15:17.541 --> 15:20.976
Well, I'll fight you, dummy!

15:20.978 --> 15:22.811
No, no, no.

15:22.813 --> 15:25.814
You don't even know!

15:25.816 --> 15:26.815
Right here!

15:26.817 --> 15:28.350
Look.

15:29.418 --> 15:31.519
Look what I just
ripped out of the ground!

15:31.521 --> 15:32.520
Oh...!

15:36.677 --> 15:38.159
What just happened?

15:38.161 --> 15:40.762
I... I just puked
on the hood of that...

15:42.499 --> 15:43.798
...police car.

15:46.169 --> 15:48.069
Well, why do
all those things?

15:48.071 --> 15:50.272
I figured if I
showed you what...

15:50.274 --> 15:52.774
"never stop partying"
really looked like,

15:52.776 --> 15:55.977
you'd realize you
can't do it forever.

15:56.913 --> 15:59.347
Oh, well.

16:01.083 --> 16:05.954
You lied to me all night
for your own selfish reasons?

16:06.923 --> 16:08.957
Daddy...!

16:10.026 --> 16:13.261
I wanted to hang out
with you-- you're my son.

16:13.263 --> 16:15.764
And since you didn't want
to come with me and J.J.

16:15.766 --> 16:17.165
on that fishing tri--

16:17.167 --> 16:19.935
Fishing trip.

16:19.937 --> 16:23.204
I'll never make it
back in time now.

16:26.042 --> 16:28.677
Hey, you know, a-a pretty
good magician like you

16:28.679 --> 16:30.178
probably knows
how to, say,

16:30.180 --> 16:33.014
get out of a standard
set of handcuffs.

16:33.016 --> 16:35.116
Perhaps.

16:36.319 --> 16:38.987
Well, here's something
you didn't know--

16:38.989 --> 16:41.957
I'm a pretty good
magician, too.

16:45.612 --> 16:47.529
Abracadabra!

16:48.799 --> 16:50.615
Congratulations!

16:50.617 --> 16:52.500
Oh, hey!
Thank you so much.

16:52.502 --> 16:54.836
We're super excited.
We're thinking June.

16:54.838 --> 16:56.271
Yeah, okay.

16:56.273 --> 16:57.806
Okay, jerk...

16:57.808 --> 17:01.309
do you remember how you ended up
buying those red cowboy boots?

17:01.311 --> 17:02.544
Wow.

17:02.546 --> 17:05.512
Wardrobe malfunction
at the O.K. Corral!

17:05.515 --> 17:07.932
I mean, who in their
right mind would ever...

17:07.934 --> 17:10.752
You would look
so totally hot in those.

17:10.753 --> 17:13.087
Do you have these in a size 11?

17:13.990 --> 17:15.991
So get off the field
at the Superdome,

17:15.992 --> 17:17.625
because you ain't no saint.

17:18.560 --> 17:20.362
Hello.

17:20.364 --> 17:21.780
I, uh...
Oh.

17:21.781 --> 17:23.999
Hi, Robin.

17:25.201 --> 17:28.737
Could I have
your phone number?

17:28.739 --> 17:31.206
We need someplace to hide.
Where?

17:31.208 --> 17:33.541
No, Jerry, this is not the time
to go to another club!

17:33.543 --> 17:37.345
We've got to get you back
home in time for that trip.

17:37.347 --> 17:39.848
But there's no more
trains, there's no cabs.

17:39.850 --> 17:41.016
Well, uh...

17:41.018 --> 17:44.636
I do have a few driving
students in the city.

17:44.638 --> 17:46.588
Step on it! Jerry...
Do not step on it.

17:46.590 --> 17:48.189
Jerry, we have got
to get you home

17:48.191 --> 17:49.424
in time for
that fishing trip.

17:49.426 --> 17:50.725
...the laws are there
to protect...

17:50.727 --> 17:52.344
This is no time for laws!
Buckle up, Barney.

17:52.346 --> 17:55.847
I am not going to buckle up!
I am your father! You will listen to me!

17:58.934 --> 18:01.436
Hey! How's the
open marriage going?

18:01.438 --> 18:03.138
Who was the first one
to get the five numbers?

18:03.140 --> 18:04.239
I won that race.

18:04.241 --> 18:06.875
My prize--
sex in the bathroom.

18:06.877 --> 18:09.611
And I won <i>that</i> race.

18:12.782 --> 18:15.116
Aw, sorry that secret crush
didn't work out for you.

18:15.118 --> 18:19.287
Oh, it's okay. I guess
it just wasn't meant to be.

18:19.289 --> 18:20.822
Why are you smiling?

18:20.824 --> 18:22.223
I don't know.

18:22.225 --> 18:24.659
Good night.

18:24.661 --> 18:26.461
Saw that girl again.

18:26.463 --> 18:28.596
And guess what?
She's engaged.

18:28.598 --> 18:30.131
So that's the end of that.

18:30.133 --> 18:32.550
<i>It wasn't the end of that.</i>
<i>More on that later.</i>

18:32.552 --> 18:36.471
And her fiancé?
The guy's like a two.

18:39.208 --> 18:41.509
How did you do it?

18:41.511 --> 18:43.010
Do what?

18:43.012 --> 18:45.346
How did you become this?

18:45.348 --> 18:48.283
I mean, I love my life, but...

18:48.285 --> 18:51.619
I'm not sure I <i>like</i>
loving it.

18:51.621 --> 18:54.322
Sure, strip clubs...
You're drifting.

18:54.324 --> 18:56.091
Hey, I'm trying to
open up to you...

18:56.093 --> 18:58.793
No, Mrs. Perkins,
you're drifting!

18:59.662 --> 19:02.197
Go on, Barney.

19:02.199 --> 19:06.134
When I think about going for
anything more than that,

19:06.136 --> 19:11.239
I look at my life,
and who I am, and...

19:11.241 --> 19:15.076
I'm too far gone.

19:15.078 --> 19:17.212
I'm broken.

19:19.181 --> 19:23.568
Son, I was far more broken
than you'll ever be.

19:23.570 --> 19:26.053
And look at me now.

19:26.055 --> 19:31.192
Don't get me wrong-- settling
down is... a challenge.

19:31.194 --> 19:33.461
It's the biggest
challenge of your life.

19:33.463 --> 19:35.263
So how do you do it?

19:35.265 --> 19:39.300
A magician never reveals
his greatest trick.

19:40.236 --> 19:42.103
But I'll give you a hint.

19:42.105 --> 19:44.739
You gotta meet the right girl.

19:46.108 --> 19:48.626
Who knows?

19:48.628 --> 19:51.412
Maybe you'll meet her tomorrow.

19:51.414 --> 19:54.883
Maybe I've met her already.

19:55.985 --> 19:58.803
And park.
And emergency brake.

20:00.990 --> 20:02.724
I did have a good time tonight.

20:02.726 --> 20:04.125
And hey,
if you want to

20:04.127 --> 20:06.094
go fishing,
we got room in the boat.

20:06.096 --> 20:08.596
Maybe some other time.

20:08.598 --> 20:09.964
Okay.

20:11.066 --> 20:12.400
Oh, and, uh...

20:12.402 --> 20:16.604
thanks for taking such
good care of this.

20:16.606 --> 20:20.074
It means a lot to me that you
kept it safe all these years.

20:36.492 --> 20:38.960
I'm going fishing with my dad.

20:57.993 --> 21:01.362
This...

21:01.364 --> 21:03.197
sucks.

21:03.199 --> 21:06.699
