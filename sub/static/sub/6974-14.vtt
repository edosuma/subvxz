01:23.883 --> 01:27.148
Dad! Dad!

01:29.089 --> 01:33.082
- Tommy, what is it?
- l'm afraid. l heard something.

01:35.528 --> 01:39.430
- lt's just the wind.
- No. l think it's under the bed.

01:39.499 --> 01:43.663
- Can you check?
- Tommy, there is nothing to be scared of.

01:43.736 --> 01:49.299
No. There's something under the bed.
You have to check.

02:11.764 --> 02:15.928
- All clear.
- Are you sure? l thought l saw something.

02:16.002 --> 02:17.993
ln the mirror.

02:21.307 --> 02:24.401
Tommy, it is just your imagination.

02:25.912 --> 02:29.211
Now, let's try to get some sleep, OK?

02:46.266 --> 02:48.291
Dad, help! lt's in here!

02:49.335 --> 02:51.326
Help! Help me!

02:52.605 --> 02:53.594
Help!

02:53.706 --> 02:55.901
Help! Dad!

02:56.943 --> 02:59.844
lt's in here! Help me!

03:00.914 --> 03:02.745
Dad!

03:03.783 --> 03:06.274
Daddy!

04:03.209 --> 04:04.335
Dr Scully?

04:04.410 --> 04:08.608
Sorry. After lunch. All questions
answered after lunch. Thank you.

04:14.254 --> 04:16.279
Agent Scully?

04:17.724 --> 04:19.281
Leyla Harrison.

04:19.392 --> 04:21.257
What a surprise.

04:21.327 --> 04:25.354
Oh, good. l was afraid
l should have maybe called first.

04:25.465 --> 04:27.490
How have you been?

04:27.567 --> 04:29.501
Oh, uh...

04:29.569 --> 04:32.766
Busy. And yourself?

04:32.872 --> 04:37.809
l'm back in Accounting now.
Happily, mind you. No regrets.

04:37.910 --> 04:41.971
Although l did relish my big adventure
on the X-Files unit last year.

04:43.149 --> 04:49.577
l have about five minutes before
my next class. Can we talk while l eat?

04:49.689 --> 04:51.486
Not a problem.

04:57.163 --> 05:01.122
lt's an X-File. l'm sure of it.

05:04.937 --> 05:06.495
Where'd you get this?

05:06.572 --> 05:10.406
l tracked down a mileage discrepancy
in the Bureau's vehicle fleet.

05:10.510 --> 05:16.574
A secretary from our Baltimore field office
used a Ford Taurus without authorization.

05:18.818 --> 05:20.217
What's it got to do with...?

05:20.286 --> 05:24.484
She was desperate to visit her grandson,
which is why she borrowed the car.

05:24.590 --> 05:28.651
She's the one who told me about this case.
This was her daughter.

05:31.764 --> 05:34.028
What makes you think this is an X-File?

05:34.100 --> 05:37.160
This dead woman's son,
my friend's grandson...

05:37.270 --> 05:40.967
This is Tommy Conlon.
Tommy is eight years old.

05:41.074 --> 05:48.139
Tommy told her a monster killed his mother,
and his father knows all about it.

05:51.684 --> 05:54.209
l know. Why take the word
of an eight-year-old?

05:54.287 --> 05:57.279
But look at the autopsy report.

06:00.860 --> 06:03.829
Clearly this woman was murdered, and yet...

06:03.930 --> 06:08.458
And yet the coroner concludes
that she stabbed herself to death.

06:10.670 --> 06:14.697
Agent Harrison, l see no reason
to disagree with the coroner.

06:15.274 --> 06:19.608
But, l mean, how could someone
stab themselves 16 times?

06:19.712 --> 06:23.944
Look, it is unusual, but l have seen it before.

06:24.684 --> 06:30.589
Tommy's father took him to a mountaintop
in Pennsylvania in the middle of nowhere.

06:30.656 --> 06:35.719
He took him away from his friends,
his family. They don't even have a phone.

06:35.828 --> 06:40.527
Tommy's own grandmother
isn't allowed to see him anymore.

06:40.633 --> 06:44.399
l'm sorry, Agent Harrison,
but unless you have other evidence...

06:44.504 --> 06:45.698
Wait, wait.

06:45.772 --> 06:52.143
Tommy said that the same monster that killed
his mother killed Spanky, his pet cat.

06:56.048 --> 06:59.950
Unless you bring me Spanky,
there's nothing l can do.

07:08.594 --> 07:11.256
Apple and tuna salad?

07:31.384 --> 07:34.683
- Hello?
- Dana, it's Monica Reyes. ls this a bad time?

07:34.787 --> 07:37.449
l was just putting the baby down. What is it?

07:37.590 --> 07:40.252
l wanted your opinion
on an autopsy finding.

07:40.326 --> 07:45.127
lt's pretty unusual -
a woman who stabbed herself 16 times.

07:45.231 --> 07:50.931
Last name Conlon? l assume
you've been talking to Leyla Harrison.

07:52.805 --> 07:55.501
Yeah. The three of us
are headed to Pennsylvania.

07:55.575 --> 07:59.204
lt sounds like you're familiar with the case.

08:01.414 --> 08:04.679
What do you mean, there is no case?

08:06.886 --> 08:09.480
All right. Thanks.

08:11.591 --> 08:15.186
Why didn't you tell us
you'd already gone to Agent Scully?

08:15.261 --> 08:21.530
- l didn't know that's who you were calling.
- That's not the point, Leyla. You misled us.

08:30.042 --> 08:33.205
Agent Doggett, we're almost there.

08:33.312 --> 08:37.214
''How'd you spend Friday night, John?''
''Driving around like an idiot.''

08:37.283 --> 08:38.943
Agent Doggett!

08:39.051 --> 08:42.817
Both of you got in this car believing
a little boy may be in danger.

08:42.889 --> 08:45.517
What's changed since then?

08:45.625 --> 08:50.289
Even if this isn't an X-File - which it is -
what will it hurt to keep going?

08:55.868 --> 08:59.269
lf Agent Mulder were here he'd keep going.

09:55.328 --> 09:58.957
- Jeffrey Conlon?
- Yeah. Can l help you?

09:59.098 --> 10:03.660
Hi. l'm Agent Monica Reyes. This is
Agent John Doggett and Agent Harrison.

10:03.736 --> 10:07.763
- We're with the FBl.
- FBl? Really?

10:08.975 --> 10:13.912
We're here at the request of Dorothy, your
mother-in-law. lt's about her grandson.

10:15.281 --> 10:17.579
Tommy is fine.

10:17.683 --> 10:21.915
l told Dorothy over and over.
There's really nothing more to say.

10:23.055 --> 10:26.183
ls that blood on your hand, Mr Conlon?

10:27.426 --> 10:29.291
Yeah. l cut myself.

10:29.428 --> 10:32.886
- On what?
- A piece of broken glass.

10:34.367 --> 10:37.859
- Sir, can we speak with your son?
- He's asleep.

10:39.005 --> 10:41.940
lt's not even seven o'clock.
Early for bedtime.

10:42.041 --> 10:46.410
Not for Tommy. And l'd appreciate it
if you'd keep your voice down.

10:46.512 --> 10:50.881
Look, l'm gonna be straight with you.
We drove a long way.

10:50.983 --> 10:56.785
Agent Doggett is stubborn. l don't think
you'll get him to leave until we see your son.

10:56.856 --> 10:58.721
Dad?

11:01.694 --> 11:06.256
- Tommy, go back inside, please.
- l heard something. l got afraid.

11:08.968 --> 11:14.065
Hi, Tommy. l'm Monica.
This is John, and this is Leyla.

11:14.140 --> 11:18.201
l'm friends with your grandmom.
She wanted us to see how you were doing.

11:18.310 --> 11:21.108
Tommy, it's too cold out here.
Go back inside.

11:21.180 --> 11:24.877
Do you remember
what you said to your grandmom?

11:25.017 --> 11:29.317
Something about your mother?
Do you remember?

11:31.991 --> 11:35.017
Monsters.

11:35.094 --> 11:38.222
You said there were monsters, right?

11:41.067 --> 11:43.297
No such thing as monsters.

11:48.541 --> 11:52.375
Tell Dorothy this is exactly why
she's not allowed to visit anymore.

11:55.581 --> 11:57.640
Now, good night.

12:00.953 --> 12:03.046
Come on.

12:11.530 --> 12:17.127
l apologize. l let my imagination run wild
and l ruined both your evenings.

12:17.203 --> 12:20.331
Thank you in advance for not yelling at me.

12:21.273 --> 12:25.607
- Something's going on here.
- Wait. There is?

12:25.711 --> 12:28.646
That boy only said what
his father wanted him to say.

12:28.748 --> 12:33.344
Did you notice the dirt on that guy's
hands and knees? He's been digging.

12:33.419 --> 12:37.287
This time of the year
he sure as hell ain't gardening.

12:37.389 --> 12:42.088
l say we find ajudge,
get a warrant and search the place.

12:48.467 --> 12:50.264
Dad?

12:51.871 --> 12:56.740
The monsters aren't gonna let
those people leave, are they?

12:56.809 --> 12:59.300
They're leaving, Tommy.

13:00.146 --> 13:02.637
They're leaving right now.

13:03.582 --> 13:05.243
lt's too late.

13:11.924 --> 13:13.653
What the hell?

13:36.048 --> 13:37.948
Oh, God!

13:39.385 --> 13:41.546
A possum maybe?

13:42.688 --> 13:47.091
That doesn't make any sense.
How'd it get from here into the vents?

14:05.945 --> 14:07.970
- Who is it?
- lt's Gabe Rotter.

14:08.047 --> 14:10.607
l have the thing you've been waiting for.

14:10.683 --> 14:12.014
Who?

14:12.084 --> 14:15.645
Gabe. Rotter?

14:15.788 --> 14:18.655
l'm a friend of Leyla Harrison.

14:23.963 --> 14:28.662
- Do you know what time it is?
- Hey, l just do as l'm told.

14:28.734 --> 14:32.534
- Enjoy.
- Whoa! What the hell is that?

14:32.605 --> 14:35.699
- A dead cat.
- Come again?

14:35.774 --> 14:41.804
His name's Spanky. Leyla said you're helping
her on a case and you needed it ASAP, so...

14:41.914 --> 14:43.814
Hey.

14:43.883 --> 14:45.441
You're welcome.

14:45.551 --> 14:49.214
l am going to be exceptionally polite.

14:49.288 --> 14:53.657
Leave. Now.
Leave now and take that with you.

14:53.726 --> 14:56.217
Do you know what l went through to get this?

14:56.295 --> 15:01.927
l snuck onto the property where your perp
used to live and l dug up the whole thing.

15:02.001 --> 15:05.562
l don't care.
Leave, now, please!

15:05.671 --> 15:11.166
Uh-uh. Leyla said she'd go out with me only
if l got you the cat and, damn it, l got it.

15:25.224 --> 15:27.419
Are you calling the cops on me?

15:27.493 --> 15:29.893
lf only.

15:30.029 --> 15:34.466
God help me, but Agent Harrison
might be on to something after all.

15:42.508 --> 15:44.601
Any luck?

15:44.710 --> 15:49.613
Our engine's shot. His truck won't start,
though l can't find one thing wrong with it.

15:49.682 --> 15:56.451
- Looks like we're here for the night.
- l'd better get Tommy back to sleep.

15:57.523 --> 16:00.515
Phones that won't work.
Cars that won't start.

16:01.593 --> 16:05.120
lt reminds me of a case
Mulder and Scully investigated.

16:05.230 --> 16:07.824
A teenager who was struck by lightning.

16:07.900 --> 16:11.358
He affected the electrical workings
of everything around him.

16:11.470 --> 16:16.237
- That's not what we're dealing with here.
- Mulder wasted no time closing that case.

16:16.342 --> 16:21.905
l just try to think like him. What would Agents
Mulder and Scully do in this situation?

16:21.981 --> 16:26.884
Agents Mulder and Scully aren't in this
situation. Agents Doggett and Reyes are.

16:28.087 --> 16:32.820
l don't know about Agent Reyes, but Agent
Doggett's gonna sit his tired ass down.

16:32.891 --> 16:35.223
What kind of a course of action is that?

16:35.294 --> 16:40.095
l think Agent Doggett is saying that
right now we're in the best possible place.

16:40.165 --> 16:44.124
Exactly. Bottom line,
we're all concerned for this boy's safety.

16:44.203 --> 16:47.172
lf we're here,
nothing's gonna happen to him, right?

16:47.272 --> 16:50.435
Help! lt's in here! Daddy!

16:52.611 --> 16:55.045
Help! Help me!

16:55.147 --> 16:57.172
Dad! Daddy!

16:58.484 --> 17:00.884
- Hey!
- No, don't do it.

17:05.491 --> 17:07.652
John.

17:52.538 --> 17:55.302
How's he doing?

17:56.175 --> 18:00.043
He's a hell of a lot calmer than l'd be.

18:00.145 --> 18:04.081
l checked the place. Whatever the hell
those things were, they're gone.

18:04.216 --> 18:07.151
l have no idea where they went.

18:16.762 --> 18:19.526
That's really good, Tommy.

18:19.631 --> 18:22.327
ls that you?

18:24.002 --> 18:26.527
- Who's that?
- That's her.

18:29.908 --> 18:35.574
Tommy, tell John what you told me,
about what we saw in your room tonight.

18:37.983 --> 18:41.146
Those are the monsters that hurt my mommy.

18:46.525 --> 18:50.757
But my dad says
l'm not supposed to talk about it.

19:03.509 --> 19:06.000
This is my house.
Why do l have to sit here?

19:06.111 --> 19:08.579
Tell me what we're dealing with.

19:09.815 --> 19:14.377
Don't tell me you don't know, because
you're not gonna like what happens next.

19:14.486 --> 19:20.118
These things were in the room with your son
and you knew it. You held the door shut!

19:20.225 --> 19:23.717
You wanna see something, look at that.
Look at that.

19:23.829 --> 19:26.889
That's what they did to me.

19:26.965 --> 19:29.297
They almost killed me one time before.

19:29.368 --> 19:32.496
They? What are they?
Some kind of animal? What?

19:32.571 --> 19:39.101
All l know is that they won't leave us alone
and l'm dealing with this the best way l can.

19:41.413 --> 19:44.940
- Now it's too late.
- How's that?

19:46.218 --> 19:52.088
They mean to kill every one of you,
and there's nothing you can do to stop it.

19:53.292 --> 19:55.817
Oh, come on.
You saw what happens.

19:55.894 --> 20:00.729
You think you've killed one
and then it becomes two.

20:00.832 --> 20:04.666
l don't think Mr Conlon
is telling us the whole truth.

20:04.736 --> 20:08.365
- No kidding.
- l mean, l think you can kill them.

20:08.473 --> 20:14.343
Because l don't know what else he would
have been burying when we showed up.

20:34.166 --> 20:39.502
You've gotta be kidding. l can't believe you're
cutting up a dead cat on your kitchen table.

20:39.571 --> 20:43.974
Will you keep your voice down, please?
You're gonna wake my baby.

20:44.042 --> 20:47.842
This just isn't right.

20:47.946 --> 20:51.438
Can you clue me in here
as to why the cat's so important?

20:51.550 --> 20:58.183
Because it would seem that poor Spanky here
may have chewed a hole in his own stomach.

20:59.324 --> 21:02.691
Which, you'll admit, is unusual behavior.

21:04.496 --> 21:07.124
You mean he killed himself?

21:07.232 --> 21:10.759
Just like his owner, Mrs Conlon,
stabbed herself with a knife.

21:10.869 --> 21:13.394
The wounds are in the same place.

21:13.538 --> 21:16.098
And if we figure out why,

21:16.174 --> 21:22.340
well, then, you'll have something really good
to share with your friend Leyla Harrison.

21:23.282 --> 21:24.977
True that.

21:26.785 --> 21:30.585
Can you hold the ribs open
while l grab that, please? Just...

21:30.656 --> 21:32.521
Now.

21:34.693 --> 21:37.526
Thank you.

21:38.430 --> 21:39.692
Agent Scully.

21:39.765 --> 21:43.166
This is Sheriff Jack Coogan.
l got a message to call this number.

21:43.268 --> 21:45.361
Hi. Thanks for getting back to me.

21:45.470 --> 21:51.340
l'm an FBl agent and l've been trying to reach
three of my colleagues that are in your area.

21:51.410 --> 21:53.378
Were they on some kind of case?

21:53.445 --> 21:57.381
They're looking into concerns expressed
by the grandmother of a child.

21:57.482 --> 22:00.645
The family name is Conlon.
l have an address...

22:00.752 --> 22:02.720
No need.

22:02.821 --> 22:09.021
l was back up there a couple of weeks ago,
got into a shouting match with the father.

22:09.528 --> 22:13.487
- Over what?
- Grandmother asked me to check on the boy.

22:13.565 --> 22:19.367
The father told me to get the hell off
his property. The boy seemed fine, so l did.

22:19.471 --> 22:23.100
As l say, Sheriff,
l need to contact my colleagues.

22:23.175 --> 22:28.442
l'm happy to take a drive up there,
but l can't promise much tonight.

22:28.547 --> 22:32.779
The roads are icing up as we speak.
Won't be easy getting in.

22:32.851 --> 22:36.252
Look, Sheriff, they may be in danger.

22:36.321 --> 22:39.085
Could you please find a way?

22:58.643 --> 23:00.907
Oh, my God.

23:01.380 --> 23:04.679
lt's no monster, Agent Harrison,
dead or alive.

23:08.687 --> 23:13.989
- You wanna explain this, Mr Conlon?
- lt's just a mirror from my son's room.

23:14.059 --> 23:17.859
- Why'd you bury it?
- Because he was afraid of it.

23:21.266 --> 23:24.201
l want you to get Tommy
bundled up in warm clothes.

23:24.336 --> 23:28.067
- l want you to pack anything you might need.
- Why?

23:28.140 --> 23:32.634
Because l don't believe one thing
you've told me, except that we're in danger.

23:32.744 --> 23:36.145
We're walking out of here, all five of us.

23:38.784 --> 23:41.150
l know what you're thinking.

23:41.219 --> 23:43.847
Black magic.

23:45.090 --> 23:48.491
Mirrors are powerful symbols
in conjuring in the dark arts.

23:48.593 --> 23:51.153
That's what this is, right?

23:58.770 --> 24:02.399
We passed a sheriff's station
maybe six miles down the mountain.

24:02.507 --> 24:04.737
lt'll be a hike, but we can make it.

24:04.810 --> 24:07.370
- Dad, the sheriff...
- No.

24:07.446 --> 24:12.850
Tommy, don't worry about the sheriff.
He's gonna help us.

24:18.323 --> 24:20.985
What's up, Tommy?
What's the matter?

24:26.131 --> 24:28.463
Stay here.

24:46.751 --> 24:50.881
Man, you're a sight for sore eyes.
John Doggett.

24:54.259 --> 24:57.160
- l'm the sheriff.
- Who called you?

24:57.262 --> 25:01.028
- Perfect timing.
- We were just leaving. We need a ride.

25:01.099 --> 25:03.567
Sorry, you can't leave.

25:04.669 --> 25:09.003
- What do you mean?
- You can't go anywhere. lt's too cold.

25:09.741 --> 25:12.232
- lt's not him.
- What?

25:13.044 --> 25:14.636
Gun!

25:17.382 --> 25:19.373
Let him go!

25:54.019 --> 25:56.920
So this is Johnny Fabulous, huh?

26:01.126 --> 26:05.722
''Mulder's so smart. Mulder's so dreamy.''

26:05.830 --> 26:10.995
That's all Leyla ever talks about:
Mulder and Scully, Scully and Mulder.

26:14.906 --> 26:19.343
This sheriff, Jack Coogan,
l'm just getting his answering machine.

26:20.845 --> 26:24.975
Hey, you're really worried.
l thought you didn't find anything.

26:25.050 --> 26:29.077
- You said there wasn't anything in that cat.
- No, there wasn't.

26:29.187 --> 26:31.815
But it seems like there should have been.

26:31.890 --> 26:35.656
- What does that mean?
- The pattern of bite marks.

26:35.727 --> 26:40.960
lt seems to me that the cat was trying
to get at something in its stomach,

26:41.066 --> 26:43.591
to chew something out.

26:43.702 --> 26:46.330
Something? What?

26:46.404 --> 26:53.242
l don't know. There wasn't any sign of it
but it obviously caused a great deal of pain.

26:53.345 --> 26:57.338
And maybe it goes the same
for the woman who tried to stab herself.

26:57.415 --> 27:03.581
l mean, what if that was
a frantic attempt to cut something out?

27:04.656 --> 27:06.886
ls Leyla in danger up there?

27:06.992 --> 27:11.156
All l know is we're wasting our time
talking about this.

27:11.262 --> 27:14.356
- Who are you calling now?
- My mom.

27:15.400 --> 27:17.925
l'm gonna beg her to baby-sit.

27:24.042 --> 27:26.010
- Got anything?
- Yeah.

27:26.111 --> 27:28.875
A salad spoon no one's ever gonna use again.

27:28.980 --> 27:31.141
And the sheriff here?

27:31.249 --> 27:36.585
Do not ask me to explain it,
but he's got absolutely no internal organs.

27:36.655 --> 27:39.453
He's like a big bag.

27:39.524 --> 27:41.822
You know what else?

27:41.893 --> 27:43.622
This isn't blood.

27:43.695 --> 27:49.930
Whatever it is, l bet it's the same crap
that's all over the inside of our car.

27:52.570 --> 27:55.164
l've been thinking.

27:58.443 --> 28:04.609
Now, l hate to sound like Agent Harrison,
but Mulder and Scully had a case like this,

28:04.683 --> 28:09.916
where they were trapped underground with
mushroom spoors that caused hallucinations.

28:10.622 --> 28:14.683
- Never mind.
- l don't know what to say either.

28:14.793 --> 28:18.752
Maybe Mulder and Scully
would see something that we don't.

28:18.863 --> 28:21.058
How?

28:21.132 --> 28:23.862
Nothing here makes any sense.

28:25.003 --> 28:29.440
Unless that's the very thing
that we need to see.

28:49.327 --> 28:53.229
- Agent Harrison, take Tommy to his room.
- Sure.

28:53.298 --> 28:55.562
Come on, Tommy.

29:02.974 --> 29:06.000
What's the matter?
You like Leyla, don't you?

29:06.111 --> 29:08.511
Can you stay with me instead?

29:15.220 --> 29:17.279
Sure. Come on.

29:28.867 --> 29:30.562
l'm just a cop, Mr Conlon.

29:30.668 --> 29:35.367
Maybe l don't have the imagination to
connect the pieces of this insanity together.

29:35.440 --> 29:40.571
You said that wasn't exactly the sheriff in
there and l wanna know what you meant.

29:40.645 --> 29:44.342
ln fact, you tried to warn us
that wasn't the sheriff and help us.

29:44.415 --> 29:47.976
Yeah. So why not help us now?

29:49.587 --> 29:53.489
Tell us what you know, Mr Conlon.
For Tommy's sake.

29:53.591 --> 29:58.893
Your son Tommy, you move him up here and
you lock him in the room with those things.

29:58.963 --> 30:02.057
lf you're trying to get rid of him...
ls that all this is?

30:02.133 --> 30:06.160
l love my son.
l love my son, you bastard.

30:06.271 --> 30:11.402
- You locked him in the room with them.
- Because l knew they wouldn't hurt him.

30:12.811 --> 30:17.373
Now, why is that? They hurt you.
They certainly hurt your wife.

30:17.448 --> 30:19.848
Why didn't they hurt Tommy?

30:31.362 --> 30:33.830
l made this.

30:36.134 --> 30:38.728
You drew all of these?

30:56.654 --> 30:58.986
This one's you.

31:05.163 --> 31:10.897
Why would you draw this, Tommy?
Why would you imagine such awful things?

31:12.270 --> 31:14.329
Because l'm afraid.

31:29.621 --> 31:31.680
Sheriff Coogan?

31:34.926 --> 31:36.257
Sheriff?

31:38.363 --> 31:41.230
- Are you Agent Scully?
- Yeah.

31:41.299 --> 31:44.462
l still can't contact my partners.
Did you get up there?

31:44.535 --> 31:49.996
l just got back from trying. The roads at that
elevation are way too dangerous right now.

31:50.108 --> 31:53.839
Sheriff, there are three FBl agents
who may be in grave danger.

31:53.945 --> 31:57.210
That's my girlfriend up there, hoss.

31:59.083 --> 32:02.246
This is the only road up to that mountain.

32:02.320 --> 32:05.619
You've got ice leading
all the way up to the peak.

32:05.690 --> 32:08.853
We have to get up there.
l mean, there must be a way.

32:08.927 --> 32:15.856
l'm sorry. Helicopter, snowplow or pack mule
- unfortunately l'm fresh out of all three.

32:20.705 --> 32:25.574
What if Tommy were at the center
of this somehow? The monsters.

32:26.844 --> 32:28.971
The sheriff.

32:30.949 --> 32:32.746
Agent Doggett?

32:37.922 --> 32:39.856
Where the hell is the body?

32:42.627 --> 32:43.924
Monica!

32:44.529 --> 32:47.760
- What happened?
- The boy.

32:51.703 --> 32:54.103
The boy! lt's all him.

32:58.576 --> 33:00.908
Oh, my God!

33:07.085 --> 33:11.283
- This is your son doing this?
- l told you. l told you to leave.

33:11.389 --> 33:13.584
This is your son? Make him stop.

33:13.658 --> 33:16.855
l can't. You don't think l've tried?

33:16.928 --> 33:21.956
l can't stop him from imagining things.
l can't stop him from being afraid.

33:22.066 --> 33:24.864
He's just a boy.
He doesn't mean to do these things.

33:24.936 --> 33:28.303
The hell he doesn't!

33:29.007 --> 33:31.237
lf you won't stop him, l will.

33:38.483 --> 33:41.179
Tommy?

33:43.321 --> 33:45.516
Stay right there.

34:46.784 --> 34:48.911
Please, please!

34:49.020 --> 34:52.581
You have to get it out! Get it out of me!

34:52.657 --> 34:56.456
Agent Reyes, hold on.
Please, hold on.

34:58.429 --> 35:01.330
Mr Conlon, help us.

35:10.007 --> 35:11.702
Oh, my God!

35:11.776 --> 35:14.142
Please!

35:38.603 --> 35:43.700
Listen to me. Listen good. These things?
These things aren't happening.

35:43.774 --> 35:46.299
- What?
- How the hell could they be?

35:46.377 --> 35:49.608
lt's like l've been saying all along.
lt's not possible.

35:49.680 --> 35:54.049
No. No, this is all real.
My wife is dead.

35:54.152 --> 35:57.280
She believed it was real
and she stabbed herself.

35:57.388 --> 36:02.121
But because l couldn't believe it,
not really, it couldn't hurt me.

36:05.029 --> 36:07.054
Come on.

36:07.131 --> 36:09.497
You're gonna help me.

36:12.670 --> 36:14.535
Dad?

36:15.373 --> 36:17.204
Dad?

36:18.176 --> 36:21.407
Dad, get in here!

36:47.705 --> 36:49.764
Wait!

36:52.944 --> 36:56.072
Where are you going?

36:56.180 --> 36:58.205
You wait here.

37:06.257 --> 37:10.318
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

37:10.428 --> 37:13.625
You're a smart boy, Tommy.
What's it look like l'm doing?

37:13.698 --> 37:15.222
No way.

37:17.201 --> 37:21.934
lf l don't stop you, my friends are gonna die.
You think l'm gonna let that happen?

37:23.307 --> 37:25.969
You won't do it. You're lying.

37:26.043 --> 37:30.173
You'd get burned too.
You're just trying to scare me.

37:33.851 --> 37:36.376
Scared yet?

38:21.499 --> 38:23.660
Thank God.

38:23.734 --> 38:26.202
Agent Harrison?

38:26.304 --> 38:28.829
Monica, are you all right?

38:31.809 --> 38:34.141
Where's John?

38:52.963 --> 38:54.555
Tommy!

38:54.665 --> 38:57.498
He's breathing. He passed out.

39:07.545 --> 39:10.810
l'm a medical doctor.

39:13.150 --> 39:15.209
You're all right.

39:30.101 --> 39:33.593
Water. You filled it with water.

39:35.973 --> 39:38.908
That's not what Tommy believed.

39:52.323 --> 39:54.723
''l want to believe.''

39:57.061 --> 40:00.622
So, this is where the magic happened, huh?

40:00.698 --> 40:02.791
lt still happens.

40:06.070 --> 40:08.265
l'm happy it's in good hands.

40:10.007 --> 40:12.498
Hey.

40:12.576 --> 40:16.012
- Speak of the devil.
- ls that so?

40:16.080 --> 40:19.049
Leyla keeps going on and on
about how you saved the day.

40:19.150 --> 40:23.917
l really do have to commend you,
Agent Doggett. You solved this case.

40:24.021 --> 40:29.459
lf it weren't for you... l don't even like
to think what would have happened.

40:30.261 --> 40:34.061
lt's clear to me now that you were
better equipped for this challenge

40:34.131 --> 40:37.259
than even Agent Mulder would have been.

40:38.169 --> 40:42.037
Your lack of imagination saved our lives.

40:42.139 --> 40:43.572
Gee, thanks.

40:43.641 --> 40:46.769
That didn't come out right, did it?

40:48.779 --> 40:51.077
So, any news on the boy?

40:51.182 --> 40:53.980
We just got back from the psych center.

40:54.051 --> 40:58.181
The doctors don't know what to make of him.
l think it goes without saying.

40:58.255 --> 41:01.588
However, they have come up
with a stopgap treatment.

41:02.226 --> 41:04.126
What's that?

41:04.261 --> 41:07.856
A way to stifle his imagination.
