Morning.

00:42.810 --> 00:44.043
Sean.

00:44.045 --> 00:46.779
Hey.
How's it going, buddy?

00:47.214 --> 00:48.781
Yeah, it came through.

00:49.950 --> 00:53.285
Well, 'cause I know you like
your offers for breakfast.

00:54.388 --> 00:57.122
Yeah, it's 2.5, 5% on the back
end.

00:57.558 --> 00:59.024
Yeah.
Will do.

00:59.293 --> 01:00.893
Hey, did you pick up my suit?

01:01.195 --> 01:02.861
It's next to your tux. I...

01:03.464 --> 01:04.464
Emma.

01:04.665 --> 01:05.497
Hey!

01:05.498 --> 01:06.799
How was Belize?

01:08.335 --> 01:09.568
Yeah?

01:13.541 --> 01:16.141
♪ This is your good morning
<i>song ♪</i>

01:16.143 --> 01:18.243
♪ It will last, all day long

01:18.245 --> 01:21.346
No.
I promise, it's Saturday!

01:21.348 --> 01:22.681
Almost.
Tomorrow.

01:22.683 --> 01:24.750
And you'll be waking up
at Cade's.

01:25.019 --> 01:25.651
Yes!

01:25.653 --> 01:27.386
And I get to go straight home
with him, too,

01:27.388 --> 01:28.087
after school, right?

01:28.089 --> 01:30.022
Mm-hmm.
You're his MVP.

01:30.024 --> 01:32.424
Go get dressed.

01:33.294 --> 01:35.461
Of course, you know you're
mine too.

01:35.463 --> 01:37.062
You could stay here instead.

01:37.064 --> 01:41.333
Make popcorn, cuddle,
watch Star Wars Episode 27.

01:41.335 --> 01:43.735
Mom, I'm ten.

01:50.344 --> 01:51.577
Can I have cereal?

01:53.380 --> 01:54.580
Sure.

01:57.418 --> 01:58.617
Wow.

01:58.752 --> 02:00.119
Where's Lupe?

02:00.121 --> 02:02.855
Ensenada.
Visiting her mother.

02:04.158 --> 02:04.490
OK.

02:04.492 --> 02:06.258
Hurry up, Sawyer.
I'm going to be late.

02:06.260 --> 02:08.293
Oh, no.
I'm taking him today.

02:09.797 --> 02:11.730
Like that?
Really?

02:11.732 --> 02:13.999
I don't have to get out of
the car.

02:14.001 --> 02:15.501
No.
I said I'm taking him.

02:15.503 --> 02:17.970
Get dressed.
You have pilates at nine.

02:17.972 --> 02:19.438
I like taking him.

02:19.507 --> 02:21.707
And I told Cade's mom I'd
meet her to hand off the gift.

02:21.709 --> 02:24.409
OK.
I know Cade's mom.

02:25.279 --> 02:26.378
Sawyer, come on, seriously!

02:26.380 --> 02:28.814
Buddy, let's do this.
I've got a flight!

02:28.816 --> 02:30.015
Wait.
Where are you going?

02:30.017 --> 02:32.117
The Tony's.
Rose, I told you this.

02:32.119 --> 02:33.952
Wait, they're Sunday.

02:34.155 --> 02:35.454
Who are the Tony's?

02:35.456 --> 02:37.356
It's an award ceremony in New
York.

02:37.358 --> 02:39.958
Daddy's client was nominated
for a play she did.

02:39.960 --> 02:42.461
It's a whole weekend, Rose.
It's like the Oscars.

02:42.463 --> 02:43.662
There's parties, there's press.

02:43.664 --> 02:46.498
I just didn't realize
that you had to be there.

02:46.500 --> 02:47.699
Rose, I'm her agent!

02:47.701 --> 02:50.836
It is okay.
I just didn't know.

02:52.640 --> 02:55.474
Can you please transfer
some money to my account?

02:55.476 --> 02:58.310
I have that hair appointment
this afternoon.

02:59.914 --> 03:02.514
I'll call Christophe and take
care of it.

03:03.984 --> 03:05.484
I checked your account.

03:05.485 --> 03:07.525
You have enough to get you
through the weekend.

03:09.757 --> 03:11.223
Have fun, honey.
Brush your teeth,

03:11.225 --> 03:13.825
and if you get lonely or
scared or anything...

03:13.827 --> 03:14.993
Mom.

03:15.663 --> 03:17.596
I know.
You're ten.

03:18.499 --> 03:20.032
My perfect ten.

04:20.894 --> 04:23.395
<i>...to the sky. Lift up and</i>

04:23.397 --> 04:28.734
<i>3... 2... 1...
lower down to the ground.</i>

04:28.736 --> 04:31.403
Wonderful job, everyone!

04:31.405 --> 04:33.071
<i>Alright...</i>

04:47.821 --> 04:48.920
Hi, Rick.

04:48.922 --> 04:50.722
Rose!
I need you.

04:50.724 --> 04:52.557
Go to the club today at noon.

04:52.559 --> 04:53.225
<i>Garden patio, okay?</i>

04:53.227 --> 04:56.561
<i>I want you to wear that
flowered halter tieback piece.</i>

04:56.563 --> 04:58.897
Gary says, "A couple of the
partners' wives

04:58.899 --> 05:00.299
are having lunch."
They know you're coming.

05:00.301 --> 05:03.568
<i>Now, I want you to see if
Cliff's wife comes.</i>

05:03.570 --> 05:05.771
<i>If she says anything
about him buying in.</i>

05:05.773 --> 05:07.072
No, Rick.
I can't.

05:07.074 --> 05:08.040
You can't?
Why?

05:08.042 --> 05:09.074
Why not?

05:09.143 --> 05:11.043
You know that I hate those
things.

05:11.712 --> 05:13.145
Rose.
I need this information.

05:13.147 --> 05:15.614
It will affect whether I make
partner.

05:15.616 --> 05:18.917
Well, I-I have to take Sawyer's
P.E. clothes.

05:18.919 --> 05:20.118
No, screw...

05:20.654 --> 05:22.621
screw Sawyer's P.E. clothes,
OK?

05:22.623 --> 05:24.056
I need you to do this.

05:24.058 --> 05:27.192
How is me glugging down
Prosecco and butter lettuce

05:27.194 --> 05:29.061
going to make you partner?

05:30.464 --> 05:32.364
Okay, you know what?
You're right, you're right.

05:32.366 --> 05:35.233
I'm sorry to interrupt the
convenience that I buy you.

05:35.235 --> 05:37.903
Why don't you just go back
to reading your magazines

05:37.905 --> 05:41.306
or whatever it is that you do,
OK?

05:47.881 --> 05:52.851
China will own half of Wilshire by
the end of the year. I promise you.

05:52.853 --> 05:53.919
Confucius say,

05:53.921 --> 05:57.756
"Not a bad thing when they're
funding half your kale habit."

05:57.758 --> 06:00.959
Gary. Nice to see you.

06:00.961 --> 06:02.894
Ah, it's always nice to be
seen.

06:02.896 --> 06:04.596
Darling, spare key.

06:04.598 --> 06:07.032
Oh, are you guys sharing a car
now?

06:07.034 --> 06:07.733
That's so cute.

06:07.735 --> 06:09.067
- They're sharing a car.
- No, no.

06:09.069 --> 06:10.068
It's more like trading it in.

06:10.070 --> 06:12.571
This one's already five days
old.

06:12.573 --> 06:14.373
Is it five?
I thought it was six.

06:14.942 --> 06:16.475
It's a new model release.

06:16.477 --> 06:18.210
That's it,
I'm staying off Mulholland.

06:18.212 --> 06:19.478
Victoria.

06:19.480 --> 06:22.047
Why can't one of your five
assistants handle this?

06:22.049 --> 06:24.716
Because they're busy assisting
me, darling.

06:24.718 --> 06:27.486
- Need a light, boss?
- Nope. I quit.

06:27.488 --> 06:28.120
It's bad for you.

06:28.122 --> 06:30.055
- But, this is good for you.
- Gary, don't!

06:30.057 --> 06:32.290
Darling, please!

06:32.292 --> 06:34.459
This is L.A.
No one will miss it.

06:34.461 --> 06:35.527
It's like he owns the place.

06:35.529 --> 06:36.962
He practically has an address
here.

06:36.964 --> 06:40.232
And he's too lazy to drive
the forty-five minutes home

06:40.234 --> 06:42.267
even though he loves his cars.

06:42.269 --> 06:43.835
Rose, you've met Gary, right?

06:43.837 --> 06:44.469
Oh, of course.

06:44.471 --> 06:46.805
I thought you were heading
to New York with Rick.

06:46.807 --> 06:47.973
We have an event tonight,

06:47.975 --> 06:50.041
but I'm scooting out there
tomorrow.

06:50.043 --> 06:51.977
Ladies,
always nice to see you.

06:51.979 --> 06:53.145
And I was just noticing,

06:53.147 --> 06:55.113
you in the floral and you in
the modern.

06:55.115 --> 06:56.848
If you switched,
much better.

06:56.850 --> 06:58.283
- Just an opinion.
- Oh, Gary!

06:58.285 --> 06:59.551
Just an opinion, darling!

06:59.553 --> 07:01.987
Vicki, you know me.
And, oh!

07:02.256 --> 07:03.922
Dessert.
On me.

07:04.358 --> 07:07.259
On us?
On us!

07:07.928 --> 07:09.060
Stop it.

07:09.062 --> 07:10.061
Keys are at valet?

07:10.063 --> 07:12.431
Okay bye, darling.
Bye, girls.

07:12.433 --> 07:13.498
- Bye, Gary.
- Bye.

07:13.500 --> 07:14.833
God.
Such a comedian.

07:14.835 --> 07:17.669
Oh, I gotta take this.

07:18.238 --> 07:19.738
Dierdre, Hi.

07:21.175 --> 07:22.274
Why not?

07:22.609 --> 07:25.110
Dierdre, they're depending on
you.

07:26.880 --> 07:28.513
No, I'll let...

07:28.515 --> 07:30.582
I'm going to handle it.
Okay?

07:30.584 --> 07:32.517
Did I call it or did I call
it...

07:32.519 --> 07:34.152
Well. I mean, once a quitter...

07:34.154 --> 07:36.521
She walked off that sitcom
on Season two.

07:36.523 --> 07:37.756
She was only a recurring...

07:37.758 --> 07:38.890
Dierdra Banks?
Cliff's wife?

07:38.892 --> 07:39.758
Yeah, she signed up to teach

07:39.760 --> 07:41.126
the Life Skills course at
New Haven

07:41.128 --> 07:43.428
which is a women's shelter
the agency sponsors,

07:43.430 --> 07:47.365
and now she's claiming
she's "out of her league"...

07:47.968 --> 07:49.501
Hi, Nancy.

07:49.503 --> 07:51.636
Hello, darling.
How are you?

07:51.638 --> 07:53.038
The Tonys.
Oh.

07:53.040 --> 07:54.406
Yeah.
No, have the best time.

07:54.408 --> 07:56.875
Nancy, I'm sorry, I can't... I
can't hear you.

07:56.877 --> 07:58.610
I think we're having a bad
connection.

07:58.612 --> 07:59.978
I'll get back to you.

08:01.582 --> 08:02.247
Hey, wait a minute.

08:02.249 --> 08:05.016
Weren't you like, Miss
Colorado, or something?

08:05.018 --> 08:07.252
Arizona.
I was Miss Arizona.

08:07.254 --> 08:10.922
Oh, that's right!
Gary was saying that.

08:10.924 --> 08:12.190
So what was your cause?

08:12.192 --> 08:15.660
My cause?
Do you mean my platform?

08:15.662 --> 08:17.996
Oh, well I spoke to teen girls

08:17.998 --> 08:20.966
on making your presence a
present.

08:22.135 --> 08:24.436
Can probably work with that.

08:24.438 --> 08:26.304
What's your day like?

08:29.610 --> 08:33.544
<i>♪ Na na na na na na na, na

08:33.547 --> 08:37.315

09:09.650 --> 09:12.551
Rick made me go to this lunch,
and one of the wives there

09:12.553 --> 09:16.054
asked if I could teach a class
to women from a shelter.

09:16.056 --> 09:17.022
She gave me an address
downtown.

09:17.024 --> 09:19.891
It's probably like a hotel
ballroom or something.

09:19.893 --> 09:22.961
Apparently, they like topics
like self-esteem,

09:22.963 --> 09:25.931
job skills,
professional wardrobing.

09:25.933 --> 09:29.801
So, I pulled out my crown and
sash!

09:29.803 --> 09:33.872
I don't know if it goes well,
maybe, maybe I could go back.

09:33.874 --> 09:36.808
You know maybe this...
this could be my thing.

09:36.810 --> 09:40.211
Anyway, I just, I thought you
might get a kick out of it.

09:40.914 --> 09:42.380
It's been a while, Mom.

09:42.382 --> 09:44.316
- If you get a minute, call...
- I'm sorry.

09:44.318 --> 09:45.584
<i>your message has been erased.</i>

09:45.586 --> 09:48.153
<i>To re-record your message
press one.</i>

09:56.496 --> 09:59.397
Learn to drive!

10:00.667 --> 10:03.535
Please leave a
<i>message after the tone.</i>

10:04.037 --> 10:06.137
Hi, Sawyer!
Honey, it's me.

10:06.139 --> 10:07.739
Remember, once you get out of
school

10:07.741 --> 10:10.175
you can turn your ringer back
on.

10:10.344 --> 10:13.144
Call me.
I miss you.

10:13.146 --> 10:17.115
And remember, I'm just a phone
call away if you need anything.

10:17.117 --> 10:18.617
Love you, Honey.

10:33.133 --> 10:35.266
<i>You have arrived.</i>

11:42.102 --> 11:43.668
Yeah.

11:43.670 --> 11:46.037
Is this the New Haven shelter?

11:46.873 --> 11:47.706
Who are you?

11:47.808 --> 11:49.874
Oh, Rose Raynes.
Bev sent me to replace Deirdre.

11:49.876 --> 11:52.343
I'm here to present to the
ladies.

11:54.147 --> 11:55.647
Okay.
Come on in.

11:56.249 --> 11:57.282
I'm Bigs.

12:13.800 --> 12:15.533
It's really nice to meet you,
Bigs.

12:15.535 --> 12:18.703
I'm sorry, could I possibly get
some help with my things?

12:18.705 --> 12:19.904
What things?

12:19.906 --> 12:21.873
Just some visuals.

12:22.609 --> 12:24.409
We'll play it by ear.

12:25.011 --> 12:26.211
Okay...
Yes.

12:26.213 --> 12:27.011
Bigs!

12:27.013 --> 12:29.647
It's Friday.
You know I need my insulin.

12:29.649 --> 12:32.450
I'm playing it by the rules.
I'm playing it straight.

12:32.452 --> 12:34.185
You've got to play back with
me.

12:34.187 --> 12:36.107
You want to play it straight,
Jasmine?

12:36.156 --> 12:37.555
Go to class today and then I'll
take you to get your insulin.

12:37.557 --> 12:40.859
See, I can't even tell you how
many laws you violatin'

12:40.861 --> 12:43.161
by holdin' my meds from me.

12:43.163 --> 12:45.697
It's discrimination!
It's blackmail,

12:45.699 --> 12:48.399
and I'm not even gonna mention
the disabilities act

12:48.401 --> 12:49.400
'cause I know my rights!

12:49.402 --> 12:51.736
You're not disabled,
you're diabetic.

12:53.140 --> 12:55.673
Who Miss America?

12:56.409 --> 12:58.176
She is your teacher.

12:58.445 --> 13:00.044
You a real Miss America?

13:00.547 --> 13:01.746
No.

13:01.815 --> 13:04.182
Why do they keep bringing these
pretty-ass white bitches

13:04.184 --> 13:05.517
to talk at us?

13:07.921 --> 13:13.091
So, where do the
"white bitches" usually stand?

13:13.493 --> 13:15.727
Oh, right.

13:15.729 --> 13:16.694
Come on.
Let's go.

13:16.696 --> 13:17.428
I'll show you where.

13:17.430 --> 13:18.630
In here.
Come on.

13:20.300 --> 13:21.299
So, they'll pretty much sit
anywhere.

13:21.301 --> 13:24.169
You can sit on the couch
or that stool over there,

13:24.171 --> 13:25.837
maybe the rug,
something like that?

13:25.839 --> 13:28.373
Ah, that's okay.
I'll stand.

13:28.375 --> 13:30.041
Do you have an easel?

13:30.210 --> 13:31.210
A what?

13:31.745 --> 13:33.812
Never mind.

13:34.381 --> 13:35.113
Ladies!

13:35.182 --> 13:36.147
It's class time!
Come on, let's go!

13:36.149 --> 13:38.550
You know, I did like two
classes last night.

13:38.552 --> 13:39.801
So, I'm good.

13:39.802 --> 13:41.051
Yeah, that's great, but we
didn't have any classes

13:41.054 --> 13:41.986
last night.

13:41.988 --> 13:43.321
Yeah, No.
We watched one of those,

13:43.323 --> 13:44.222
things on Dr. Phil.

13:44.224 --> 13:45.657
It was a crazy intervention
thing.

13:45.659 --> 13:46.891
Sammy and I watched it
together.

13:46.893 --> 13:50.829
This woman with her daddy, her
baby-daddy, her husband,

13:50.831 --> 13:51.763
whose child is it?

13:51.765 --> 13:53.531
Dr. Phil was sweating like
Nixon.

13:53.533 --> 13:55.400
It... it changed me.

13:55.402 --> 13:56.768
Maybelle.
Maybelle.

13:56.770 --> 13:57.402
Come out here.

13:57.404 --> 13:59.137
Bring your notebook.
Let's go.

13:59.739 --> 14:00.638
Leslie!

14:00.640 --> 14:01.673
<i>Coming!</i>

14:01.675 --> 14:02.807
Life Skills!

14:02.809 --> 14:04.442
Hi!
I'm Rose.

14:06.746 --> 14:08.012
Hey, you've got dinner duty

14:08.014 --> 14:08.680
tonight, right?

14:08.682 --> 14:10.148
Yeah, I got it.

14:10.217 --> 14:11.516
Oh, yes, I love me some
Leslie-baby cooking.

14:11.518 --> 14:12.183
What you cookin'?

14:12.185 --> 14:13.918
You cook like a fat black
woman.

14:13.920 --> 14:15.954
Hey, whatever twenty bucks
of ingredients gets me.

14:15.956 --> 14:17.488
All right, all right.

14:17.591 --> 14:19.691
Notebooks, notebooks, and give
me the phones, please.

14:19.693 --> 14:20.425
Give me the phones.

14:20.427 --> 14:22.493
Why you always gotta be takin'
our cell phones.

14:22.495 --> 14:24.662
That's an invasion of privacy.

14:24.664 --> 14:26.865
House rules.
No phones during class.

14:27.000 --> 14:28.366
What time is it?

14:28.367 --> 14:29.733
You got fifty-eleven clocks in
here and none of them work.

14:29.736 --> 14:30.869
You got to tell me since

14:30.871 --> 14:31.703
I ain't got a phone.

14:31.705 --> 14:32.937
Why don't you get a watch?

14:32.939 --> 14:33.938
It's 3:04.

14:33.940 --> 14:35.340
This class ends at 4:00 p.m.

14:35.342 --> 14:37.141
I expect you to be outside
waiting

14:37.143 --> 14:41.179
to take me to go get my insulin
by 4:01 PM, Bigs.

14:41.181 --> 14:41.946
Oh, wait, I need to go, too,

14:41.948 --> 14:44.048
because I gotta get groceries
for dinner.

14:44.050 --> 14:45.383
What's the matter with your
car?

14:45.385 --> 14:46.251
It's moody.

14:46.253 --> 14:47.318
Yeah, me too.

14:47.320 --> 14:48.086
All right.
Listen up!

14:48.088 --> 14:50.388
Class starts now.
It's 3:05...

14:50.390 --> 14:52.090
60 minutes, that's house rules.

14:52.092 --> 14:53.491
At 4:05, I will take anyone who

14:53.493 --> 14:56.628
wants to go on a little errand
run, okay?

14:56.863 --> 14:58.296
What's your name again?

14:58.298 --> 14:58.830
Rose.

14:58.832 --> 15:02.734
Rose... is taking Deirdre's
place this week, okay?

15:02.969 --> 15:03.969
Enjoy.

15:05.639 --> 15:07.672
- Thank you.
- What's this?

15:07.674 --> 15:10.108
My bio.
Could you please read it?

15:10.110 --> 15:11.809
...why can't you read it?

15:11.878 --> 15:14.946
Well, it's written in third
person, for someone else to...

15:14.948 --> 15:18.049
Typically before I present,
someone introduces me?

15:18.051 --> 15:19.350
Yeah, that's what I just did.
That's what I did.

15:19.352 --> 15:21.419
- I just introduced you.
- I'll do it!

15:26.226 --> 15:27.825
"Rose Landry...

15:27.827 --> 15:31.829
Oh. Raynes.
It's, Rose Raynes, now.

15:31.831 --> 15:33.231
Rose "Raynes"

15:33.233 --> 15:35.600
"Rose Raynes is a Phoenix
native

15:35.602 --> 15:36.935
and daughter of Suzanna Landry

15:36.937 --> 15:41.139
and the step daughter of the
Honorable Judge Joseph Landry.

15:41.141 --> 15:45.076
Rose graduated from Mesa Vista
High School where she was

15:45.078 --> 15:46.477
captain of the cheer squad

15:46.479 --> 15:48.947
and the president of the
Thespian Society."

15:48.949 --> 15:51.115
You know, I think my second
husband left me

15:51.117 --> 15:53.351
for someone in the lesbian
society.

15:53.353 --> 15:54.319
She said, "Thespian".

15:54.321 --> 15:56.287
That's them girls who twirl
flags.

15:56.289 --> 15:57.633
- Thespian...
- No, its...

15:57.657 --> 15:58.589
Actually, it's like the drama
club.

15:58.591 --> 16:00.325
- Yes... Yes!
- You know... acting.

16:00.327 --> 16:02.293
Oh, so you an actress.

16:02.896 --> 16:03.528
I was...

16:03.530 --> 16:05.763
You know what?
Let's... let's forget the bio.

16:05.765 --> 16:06.597
Thank you.

16:06.666 --> 16:07.765
It's really out of date,
anyway.

16:07.767 --> 16:11.936
Basically, what it says is,
many, many years ago,

16:11.938 --> 16:13.237
I was Miss Arizona.

16:13.239 --> 16:16.307
And now, I'm here to teach
a Life Skills class.

16:16.309 --> 16:18.443
I'm filling in for Dierdra,
who...

16:18.445 --> 16:20.178
had some someplace else she
had to be.

16:20.180 --> 16:22.447
I wish I had some else to be.

16:22.449 --> 16:23.715
You're being rude,
now.

16:23.717 --> 16:25.283
You shut up, Maybelle!
You the motor mouth!

16:25.285 --> 16:27.118
- Motor mouth, Maybelle!
- You know what? Both of you!

16:27.120 --> 16:30.455
Shut up!
Sit down, Jasmine.

16:30.457 --> 16:31.656
Thank you.

16:33.626 --> 16:36.227
Everyday, we each wake up and
ask ourselves

16:36.229 --> 16:37.161
the same question.

16:37.163 --> 16:40.164
"What gift can I offer the
world?"

16:40.166 --> 16:41.399
That is not my top question.

16:41.401 --> 16:43.835
Were you on TV when you
were Miss Arizona?

16:43.837 --> 16:46.371
The National pageant
was televised, yes.

16:46.373 --> 16:47.205
Ya know, I was on TV, too,

16:47.207 --> 16:49.407
in the studio audience of
Let's Make a Deal

16:49.409 --> 16:52.043
and I almost got to come on
down but this woman

16:52.045 --> 16:53.878
just bum-rushed the stage.
She just lost her mind.

16:53.880 --> 16:56.214
Please! Just let her do her
presentation!

16:56.216 --> 16:57.415
All right, then.

16:57.417 --> 16:59.183
Continue.

17:00.120 --> 17:01.519
The gifts we offer others

17:01.521 --> 17:03.254
should reflect our
best selves,

17:03.256 --> 17:05.123
our brightest aspirations.

17:05.125 --> 17:07.224
Our boldest dreams.

17:07.227 --> 17:08.626
And, when...

17:08.627 --> 17:12.296
when we dig deep to find our
inner beauty

17:12.298 --> 17:14.999
we discover the potential...

17:15.001 --> 17:17.502
of our outer beauty.

17:20.807 --> 17:22.540
We may not choose our names

17:22.541 --> 17:24.809
or where we were born but,

17:24.944 --> 17:27.845
the one present we always
can control...

17:30.917 --> 17:32.784
is our presence.

17:34.020 --> 17:36.554
I'm sorry.
I'm-I'm not prepared.

17:36.723 --> 17:37.955
I am not what you need.

17:37.957 --> 17:38.756
Nuh uh!

17:38.758 --> 17:40.291
Nuh uh, Miss Arizona!
You ain't goin' nowhere!

17:40.293 --> 17:43.795
If you don't do this class,
I don't get my insulin.

17:44.164 --> 17:45.396
Teach!

17:45.765 --> 17:49.033
Just keep going.
You're doing great.

17:53.273 --> 17:55.406
Okay...

17:56.409 --> 17:59.577
How about a do-over.
Yeah?

18:00.780 --> 18:02.080
Life Skills.
Okay?

18:02.082 --> 18:04.082
You know what, why don't we go
around the room

18:04.084 --> 18:08.653
and each of you tells me your
name where you're from, and...

18:08.788 --> 18:11.689
how about what you want most in
life.

18:11.691 --> 18:14.792
Right now.
Jasmine let's start with you.

18:14.794 --> 18:19.664
Jasmine from south central,
and I need 4:05 to happen.

18:19.666 --> 18:22.300
Great!
Promise it will!

18:22.302 --> 18:23.568
Next.

18:24.504 --> 18:28.239
Her name's Sammy.
She moved around a lot.

18:28.241 --> 18:30.675
Oh!
Her parents in the military?

18:31.544 --> 18:32.844
Foster care.

18:32.846 --> 18:36.614
Right now, she just needs
a safe place to stay.

18:37.784 --> 18:40.051
Well, then I'm glad you're
here, Sammy.

18:40.053 --> 18:41.752
It's nice to meet you.

18:44.190 --> 18:45.690
Uh, my turn?

18:47.127 --> 18:49.160
Great.
I'm Leslie.

18:49.162 --> 18:52.463
Born and raised a Dodger.
"Whoa!"

18:52.465 --> 18:56.734
Um, I'm a hairdresser.
Mother of three.

18:56.736 --> 18:58.436
12, 10, and 7.

18:58.438 --> 19:02.974
And, what I need most right
now is to find my boys.

19:03.877 --> 19:05.243
Get em back.

19:06.679 --> 19:09.046
And you don't know where
they are?

19:11.251 --> 19:12.251
No.

19:13.319 --> 19:17.822
After Mick created his last
masterpiece on me he...

19:17.824 --> 19:20.291
he changed the locks while I
was at work.

19:20.927 --> 19:24.162
So, a friend recommended this
place but they don't...

19:24.264 --> 19:25.263
They don't take kids here

19:25.265 --> 19:27.098
because there's not enough
room.

19:27.100 --> 19:29.700
So, I just stayed here one
night.

19:29.702 --> 19:32.236
Went back home the next
morning to get the boys

19:32.238 --> 19:35.406
breakfast and off to school
and,

19:38.178 --> 19:40.077
and they were gone.

19:44.851 --> 19:48.653
Anyway, Mick's still there in
and out.

19:48.988 --> 19:51.088
I drive by on my way to work.

19:51.157 --> 19:52.190
Have you gone to the police?

19:52.192 --> 19:53.791
Of course, she's been to the
police!

19:53.793 --> 19:55.593
They make her stand on line
and fill out forms!

19:55.595 --> 19:58.696
That's their answer, their
prescription for everything!

19:58.698 --> 19:59.430
Paperwork!

19:59.432 --> 20:01.299
Yeah, they referred me to a
lawyer

20:01.301 --> 20:03.034
and a private investigator.

20:03.036 --> 20:05.603
The state prosecutor's
backed up.

20:06.372 --> 20:09.640
I got a pro bono group
reviewing my case.

20:10.310 --> 20:13.344
In the meantime,
I'm um,

20:13.713 --> 20:16.113
saving my money and

20:16.216 --> 20:18.115
looking for my boys.

20:21.854 --> 20:25.590
Yeah, I'm Maybelle,
short for Maybelline.

20:25.592 --> 20:26.591
I grew up in Tennessee.

20:26.593 --> 20:28.259
Lived all over the south,
really.

20:28.261 --> 20:30.428
Followed my fourth ex-husband

20:30.430 --> 20:31.696
down here in '03.

20:31.698 --> 20:34.565
I'm kind of an expert
on who not to marry.

20:34.801 --> 20:35.800
Divorce 101.

20:35.802 --> 20:38.069
That's a life skill I could
teach!

20:38.071 --> 20:40.805
Sorry, what was your question,
sweetie?

20:40.940 --> 20:42.106
Oh um,

20:42.108 --> 20:43.608
what you want most in life.

20:43.610 --> 20:45.509
Oh, what do I want most?

20:45.578 --> 20:46.110
A job!

20:46.112 --> 20:48.913
That way I could leave this
joint.

20:48.915 --> 20:49.547
A job!

20:49.549 --> 20:51.716
Great!
Let's start there.

20:51.718 --> 20:53.584
What would your dream job be?

20:53.586 --> 20:55.820
I think I would make a great
life coach.

20:55.822 --> 20:57.588
Those who can't do,
teach.

20:57.590 --> 20:59.957
Oh, let's not dismiss her
dream.

20:59.959 --> 21:03.694
Okay, so to be a life coach
or to get any job really,

21:03.696 --> 21:06.597
this... this is an area where
your presence

21:06.599 --> 21:08.132
literally pays off!

21:08.134 --> 21:09.600
What is your job?

21:09.602 --> 21:11.235
Oh, I stay at home with my son.

21:11.237 --> 21:13.371
But, like before that.
What did you do?

21:13.373 --> 21:15.640
Well, I got married young.
Um.

21:15.642 --> 21:18.376
I tried acting for a minute
and,

21:18.378 --> 21:21.212
You know, I spent my years as
Miss Arizona,

21:21.214 --> 21:23.814
traveling and speaking to
audiences.

21:23.816 --> 21:25.616
So what you saying is,

21:25.618 --> 21:28.085
you ain't never had no real
job?

21:28.087 --> 21:30.821
She in here teachin' a job
skills class

21:30.823 --> 21:32.356
and ain't got one!

21:33.359 --> 21:35.526
Bigs, is this some kind a
joke or somethin'?

21:35.528 --> 21:37.662
<i>Jasmine, class isn't over!</i>

21:37.664 --> 21:39.463
Hey, being a mom is a job.

21:39.465 --> 21:41.799
So what, are you on any TV
shows,

21:41.801 --> 21:43.434
like what shows what I've seen
you on?

21:43.436 --> 21:45.436
It ain't like you got to apply

21:45.438 --> 21:46.470
to be no trophy wife.

21:46.472 --> 21:49.573
We in here trying to learn how
to fill out job applications.

21:49.575 --> 21:51.375
Ever filled out one of them?

21:52.111 --> 21:53.544
I have, actually.

21:53.546 --> 21:54.812
You know, I'm trying
to pick up

21:54.814 --> 21:56.914
a gig at night and I just...

21:56.916 --> 21:58.849
I don't even know what address
to put.

21:58.851 --> 22:00.051
You can't list this one.

22:00.053 --> 22:02.553
For safety reasons, we just end
up looking homeless.

22:02.555 --> 22:03.321
Yeah, I just make one up.

22:03.323 --> 22:04.488
You know, they never look,
anyway.

22:04.490 --> 22:07.491
Well, on any application you
only want to include things

22:07.493 --> 22:10.061
that cast you in a flattering
light...

22:10.129 --> 22:12.363
awards,
achievements.

22:12.365 --> 22:14.332
What if you have a felony?

22:15.034 --> 22:16.067
I... um...

22:16.069 --> 22:19.070
I mean, do I list that on my
application?

22:20.039 --> 22:23.908
I-I guess it depends
on the charge?

22:23.910 --> 22:26.243
Girl,
you got a rap sheet a mile long.

22:26.245 --> 22:28.212
It only leads up to that
felony.

22:28.214 --> 22:29.780
Well it makes sense when

22:29.782 --> 22:30.815
I explain it.

22:30.917 --> 22:34.118
So, you know when my fourth
ex-husband left me,

22:34.120 --> 22:35.586
he took my dog.

22:37.123 --> 22:38.689
Let me tell you something.

22:38.758 --> 22:43.194
You threaten my dog,
I'll shoot you in the face.

22:45.131 --> 22:46.131
I see.

22:46.332 --> 22:47.865
So, Miss Arizona.

22:47.867 --> 22:50.434
Does she need to put
that on the application?

22:51.404 --> 22:53.938
...I maybe wouldn't put that.

22:53.940 --> 22:56.240
See, you don't know nothing
about how hard it is

22:56.242 --> 22:59.310
to find a job when the world
don't need you.

22:59.312 --> 23:01.112
Actually, I do.

23:01.514 --> 23:03.047
Do you see that crown?

23:03.149 --> 23:06.250
That is the last time someone
told me I was worth anything.

23:06.252 --> 23:07.351
Girl, stop!

23:07.353 --> 23:08.285
It look like you got a man

23:08.287 --> 23:09.587
taking pretty good care of
you!

23:09.589 --> 23:13.157
Yeah, my husband hasn't looked
me in the eyes since

23:13.159 --> 23:15.393
the day our son was born.

23:15.628 --> 23:17.361
And, Sawyer's ten.

23:17.430 --> 23:21.532
Today, he told me he's too
old to hug me anymore.

23:21.534 --> 23:23.934
I'd get a job if I had a degree
or experience

23:23.936 --> 23:25.803
in anything besides bleaching
my teeth.

23:25.805 --> 23:27.705
Listen, I realize it might not

23:27.707 --> 23:30.474
seem like I have real problems
but, you know what?

23:30.476 --> 23:34.078
I am here and I am willing
to help in any way I can.

23:34.080 --> 23:36.347
Maybelle, you want to be a life
coach?

23:36.349 --> 23:37.181
I believe you can!

23:37.183 --> 23:38.082
I don't know what it takes,

23:38.084 --> 23:39.850
but maybe I can help you find
out.

23:39.852 --> 23:44.488
I can help all of you!

23:44.824 --> 23:46.157
Amen!

23:46.159 --> 23:48.592
She one of them girls that did
a monologue for her talent.

23:48.594 --> 23:49.894
- Jasmine...
- What!

23:49.896 --> 23:51.829
Why you gotta be like that?

23:55.668 --> 23:57.201
Hey, Bigs? You gettin' that?

23:57.203 --> 23:58.436
<i>Yeah.</i>

23:58.438 --> 23:59.904
The house line's unlisted.

23:59.906 --> 24:02.540
Sammy's ex got it somehow
and called yesterday.

24:02.542 --> 24:03.674
We think he might
know she's here.

24:03.676 --> 24:06.143
Which means here is a very
dangerous place to be.

24:06.145 --> 24:07.978
Leslie!
Is your car working today?

24:07.980 --> 24:09.213
Yeah, it's possible.
I don't...

24:09.215 --> 24:10.247
Okay, we might be having some
company.

24:10.249 --> 24:12.917
I need you guys to go and get
Jasmine's medicine

24:12.919 --> 24:14.819
and don't come back until
I call you, okay?

24:14.821 --> 24:16.353
- Okay.
- Got it.

24:16.789 --> 24:18.022
Rose!

24:18.024 --> 24:19.657
I'm sorry, we're going to have
to reschedule, okay?

24:19.659 --> 24:20.991
Oh, no. That's okay.

24:20.993 --> 24:22.026
Okay.

24:26.432 --> 24:29.467
Girl, damn your car!

24:30.536 --> 24:32.369
This car make me itch.

24:38.711 --> 24:39.510
You outta gas?

24:39.512 --> 24:41.712
It's the ignition.

24:46.385 --> 24:46.851
Come on!

24:46.853 --> 24:47.952
All right, all right.

24:47.954 --> 24:48.686
This isn't working.

24:48.688 --> 24:50.054
Let's get the Princess to take
us.

24:50.056 --> 24:51.689
You know she's lookin'
for somethin' to do.

24:51.691 --> 24:53.624
Come on, come on!
Let it go!

24:53.626 --> 24:55.493
I hate this car!

24:56.095 --> 24:58.128
You ask her!

25:03.436 --> 25:04.368
Unlock it.

25:04.370 --> 25:07.004
You're taking us to the
pharmacy.

25:07.540 --> 25:08.472
Uh, sure.

25:08.474 --> 25:10.508
Yeah.
Hop in!

25:18.084 --> 25:20.484
This one of them cars that talk
at ya?

25:20.486 --> 25:22.753
There's a voice control
feature.

25:24.156 --> 25:25.656
You wanna step on it, grandma?

25:25.658 --> 25:26.757
We all got a good enough reason

25:26.759 --> 25:28.692
to get out of this
neighborhood.

25:29.462 --> 25:30.361
Sure.

25:30.429 --> 25:31.345
Would think you more

25:31.346 --> 25:32.346
than the rest of us.

25:32.698 --> 25:34.999
<i>We've hit the 5, the 405,</i>

25:35.001 --> 25:37.701
<i>the 101, all in
Friday traffic!</i>

25:37.703 --> 25:39.937
<i>I said take the 110.</i>

25:40.172 --> 25:41.338
<i>Hmm.</i>

25:42.542 --> 25:43.707
Let me see, valet.
Ooh!

25:43.709 --> 25:46.477
So, somebody just come and
park your car right now?

25:46.479 --> 25:47.278
No.

25:47.346 --> 25:48.512
Rich people.

25:49.615 --> 25:51.048
What is all this down here?

25:51.050 --> 25:51.982
So, if you put it on this,

25:51.984 --> 25:53.784
this is buying a Christmas
tree?

25:54.387 --> 25:55.452
What's that?

25:55.588 --> 25:56.687
Is that for falling cactuses?

25:56.689 --> 25:57.688
Like if you get hit by a
cactus?

25:57.690 --> 26:00.224
A cactus hits you in the side,
you just press that?

26:00.893 --> 26:02.326
It's been like, an hour.

26:02.328 --> 26:04.328
More like three.

26:04.330 --> 26:05.329
If you give me an address,

26:05.331 --> 26:07.298
- we can punch it in.
- I know where I'm going.

26:07.300 --> 26:08.465
Turn left.

26:08.768 --> 26:10.868
Oh, no no no.
Turn right.

26:11.938 --> 26:14.405
What's the street
name, maybe?

26:14.407 --> 26:15.806
Don't worry about it,
princess.

26:15.808 --> 26:17.575
She knows the street!

26:17.577 --> 26:18.976
Sammy's carsick.

26:18.978 --> 26:20.511
Yeah, she's gonna hurl, if you
keep

26:20.513 --> 26:21.312
making those hairpin turns.

26:21.314 --> 26:24.114
Y'all shut up back there.
I know where I'm goin'.

26:24.116 --> 26:25.549
Besides, no one is getting car
sick

26:25.551 --> 26:27.251
with Miss Turtle here on the
wheel.

26:27.253 --> 26:28.052
Don't most people want to see

26:28.054 --> 26:30.254
how fast they can drive these
things?

26:30.723 --> 26:32.623
See that's it.
Right there.

26:32.625 --> 26:34.758
"Korean Pharmacy."

26:34.927 --> 26:36.627
Is it Korean insulin?

26:36.629 --> 26:38.295
There ain't no Korean insulin,

26:38.297 --> 26:40.030
they just got the best co-pays.

26:40.032 --> 26:42.366
Alright, y'all don't go off and
leave me.

26:42.368 --> 26:45.469
Though, I'd catch up with the
way you drive.

26:45.471 --> 26:46.770
Hurry.

26:48.007 --> 26:49.106
"Best co-pays."

26:49.108 --> 26:51.108
Yeah, I wanna get
me some of that

26:51.110 --> 26:52.910
"Korean insulin."

26:53.980 --> 26:55.746
Is she diabetic?

27:01.554 --> 27:04.688
So, what does he do?

27:05.958 --> 27:07.458
Oh, are you asking me?

27:07.460 --> 27:10.127
Yeah, your husband.
What does he do?

27:10.129 --> 27:12.763
Oh, he's a talent agent.

27:13.299 --> 27:15.432
Wait, like for actors?

27:15.501 --> 27:15.833
Yes.

27:15.835 --> 27:17.468
Do he know anyone famous?

27:17.837 --> 27:21.271
Well, he reps most of the
people on that show.

27:21.273 --> 27:22.539
He packaged that show.

27:22.541 --> 27:23.674
Really?
I love that show!

27:23.676 --> 27:25.542
Wait, so what does that mean,
packaged?

27:25.544 --> 27:28.345
It's when an agent puts
together like a,

27:28.347 --> 27:29.947
group deal of talent.

27:29.949 --> 27:32.783
Keeps things agency friendly,
it's more commission.

27:32.785 --> 27:35.285
I always wanted to do hair
on a movie set.

27:35.287 --> 27:38.222
I did a shampoo commercial once
for a friend.

27:38.391 --> 27:39.790
I did a shampoo commercial!

27:39.792 --> 27:44.228
"Turn your locks lovely with
Lovely Locks 2-in-1."

27:44.230 --> 27:47.231
I completely forgot I had
a hair appointment.

27:47.233 --> 27:48.899
You know, Leslie can do your
hair.

27:48.901 --> 27:51.301
Hang on, I think I saw your
commercial.

27:51.303 --> 27:53.470
Dude, I recognize...
I recognize you!

27:53.472 --> 27:55.305
I used to pay attention to that
kind of stuff.

27:55.307 --> 27:57.975
Wait, did your husband get you
that job?

27:58.310 --> 28:00.310
Only job he ever got me.

28:00.312 --> 28:01.312
Really.

28:01.347 --> 28:03.947
Yeah, he... he judged the Miss
Arizona pageant.

28:03.949 --> 28:06.684
Promised me the world.
Moved me to LA.

28:06.686 --> 28:11.822
But, then he signed some
really big clients and...

28:12.091 --> 28:14.925
Anyway.
I got pregnant, so.

28:16.595 --> 28:19.329
You ever meet Billy Bob
Thornton?

28:20.099 --> 28:22.900
Wait, so do you like,
go to the Oscars and stuff?

28:22.902 --> 28:23.467
I did once.

28:23.469 --> 28:25.269
Rick's actually at the Tonys
this weekend.

28:25.271 --> 28:28.072
Really.
So, why aren't you with him?

28:28.074 --> 28:30.040
Oh.
It's just work for him.

28:30.042 --> 28:32.609
There's no point
bringing me along.

28:33.646 --> 28:34.745
Well, Honey.

28:34.747 --> 28:35.746
There's just one reason

28:35.748 --> 28:39.450
a man doesn't want to
bring his wife along.

28:40.152 --> 28:41.719
Miss America!

28:41.721 --> 28:44.288
Alright, they out.
We got to go somewhere else.

28:45.057 --> 28:46.657
What's in your bag?

28:46.659 --> 28:47.558
My insulin.

28:47.560 --> 28:49.993
Don't worry I've got another
supplier around the street.

28:49.995 --> 28:53.063
So, we can just make a quick
little drive-by.

28:53.065 --> 28:56.800
Okay, do you think maybe we
could stop at a store first?

28:56.802 --> 28:59.403
I mean, if Im cooking tonight,
I need to get a few things.

28:59.405 --> 29:01.105
No, no.
We're not going back 'til we

29:01.107 --> 29:02.106
get the all clear from Bigs.

29:02.108 --> 29:03.874
Well, I'm starving.
We gotta eat some time.

29:03.876 --> 29:06.510
Okay, well there's a taco
truck right there, so,

29:06.512 --> 29:08.345
twenty bucks of tacos it is.

29:10.416 --> 29:12.516
Okay, give me one chimichanga.

29:12.518 --> 29:13.951
A combo.
I need some chips.

29:13.953 --> 29:15.953
I don't have enough.
I told you.

29:15.955 --> 29:17.755
You can't have the munchies
yet,

29:17.757 --> 29:18.956
it's only been like 5 minutes.

29:18.958 --> 29:20.557
Popped out like eight kids.

29:20.559 --> 29:23.026
Sammy. Just one taco?

29:23.028 --> 29:25.395
Rose, you sure I can't
get you something?

29:25.397 --> 29:27.498
Oh, no, I'm fine.
Thank you.

29:27.500 --> 29:29.867
Are you sure?
I got three bucks left.

29:29.869 --> 29:32.903
You don't want like a taquito
or anything?

29:33.572 --> 29:34.705
You have it.

29:34.707 --> 29:35.906
We'll split it.

29:35.908 --> 29:36.740
You got all that extra money

29:36.742 --> 29:38.442
but you can't give me no
chips?

29:38.444 --> 29:39.376
Zip it.

29:39.445 --> 29:41.211
Girl, you better eat that
taquito!

29:41.213 --> 29:43.213
That's it.
Thank you.

29:48.854 --> 29:50.687
Oh, no.

29:55.561 --> 29:56.860
No bueno?

29:56.929 --> 30:01.632
I just haven't really felt much
like eating lately.

30:01.967 --> 30:03.600
I can't even imagine.

30:04.303 --> 30:07.604
Sawyer's at his first sleepover
tonight and I...

30:10.709 --> 30:13.777
Mama can't rest without
her cubs.

30:15.648 --> 30:17.815
You have a ten-year-old too,
right?

30:18.150 --> 30:18.816
Yeah.

30:18.818 --> 30:20.317
What is he into?

30:21.086 --> 30:25.155
You know.
Soccer, friends.

30:25.658 --> 30:26.456
Oh, who am I kidding.

30:26.458 --> 30:29.092
Not showering, not doing his
homework,

30:29.094 --> 30:32.663
and you know,
thinking he's too old for me.

30:33.098 --> 30:33.864
Mine, too.

30:33.866 --> 30:35.699
Sawyer used to be my little
buddy.

30:35.701 --> 30:37.000
He would hold my hand at the

30:37.002 --> 30:38.068
mall, and play with my hair,

30:38.070 --> 30:40.470
and now, he just looks at me
like,

30:40.472 --> 30:42.005
"Where you come from?"

30:46.445 --> 30:47.845
You'll get them back.

30:51.350 --> 30:53.851
I won't stop until I do.

30:58.991 --> 31:01.325
I worried this might happen.

31:02.628 --> 31:05.295
He always threatened that if I
left,

31:05.297 --> 31:07.831
I'd never see my boys again.

31:08.200 --> 31:10.167
But, I just never...

31:12.938 --> 31:14.171
Anyway.

31:14.240 --> 31:16.440
At some point you have to
wonder

31:16.442 --> 31:19.209
if you're doing your boys more
harm

31:19.211 --> 31:21.278
letting them see their dad

31:21.280 --> 31:24.448
treat their mom a certain way,
you know?

31:36.095 --> 31:37.561
Does she ever...

31:38.731 --> 31:39.730
Talk?

31:39.732 --> 31:44.801
Yeah, occasionally we can, you
know, pull a few words out.

31:45.771 --> 31:47.638
It's a trust thing.

31:48.040 --> 31:51.341
I just think it's a lot easier
for her to just

31:51.343 --> 31:54.211
live outside of her own life,
you know?

31:54.580 --> 31:58.048
Bigs told me about when she
first got to the shelter

31:58.050 --> 32:00.584
it was... it was bad.

32:01.086 --> 32:02.552
He...

32:04.323 --> 32:07.090
Her ex beat her broken.

32:07.092 --> 32:11.995
He... locked her in this tiny
little garage shed

32:11.997 --> 32:14.264
for months on end.

32:14.733 --> 32:17.401
Wouldn't feed her unless
she...

32:17.770 --> 32:19.069
performed.

32:23.709 --> 32:27.945
Found out the police were after
him and he just like took off.

32:28.614 --> 32:30.080
Left her in there.

32:30.883 --> 32:32.082
No food.

32:33.018 --> 32:35.786
Took them two weeks to find
her.

32:36.522 --> 32:38.055
Arizona!

32:38.057 --> 32:39.423
Good to go?

32:39.491 --> 32:41.959
You managed to finish
half a taquito.

32:47.566 --> 32:48.966
Anyway.

32:49.601 --> 32:51.868
We appreciate you helping us.

32:54.139 --> 32:55.372
Yeah.

33:02.448 --> 33:03.213
Right here.

33:03.215 --> 33:04.581
To the right.
Pull over.

33:05.451 --> 33:07.651
I don't see any drugstores.

33:07.653 --> 33:09.720
He does it outta of his house.

33:10.356 --> 33:12.856
Jasmine, are you buying drugs?

33:12.858 --> 33:14.658
Yeah, duh, of course!
I told you.

33:14.660 --> 33:17.060
I am not assisting in your
drug deal!

33:17.062 --> 33:17.728
Okay, hold tight.

33:17.730 --> 33:20.063
Ain't nobody gonna take
your crown away from you.

33:20.065 --> 33:22.199
It's medicinal.
I have a condition.

33:22.201 --> 33:25.402
It's legal now anyway.
It's all over the news.

33:25.504 --> 33:28.772
Oh, are you talking about
marijuana?

33:28.774 --> 33:30.841
Yeah, Sherlock.

33:30.843 --> 33:33.944
Oh, yeah, I've actually heard
of the benefits.

33:33.946 --> 33:36.346
My friend's daughter has
seizures and she said that

33:36.348 --> 33:38.648
the PCP oil has healing
properties

33:38.650 --> 33:40.250
without getting you high.

33:40.319 --> 33:41.585
Yeah.

33:41.653 --> 33:43.754
You want to get that PCP oil
any time you gotta headache,

33:43.756 --> 33:45.655
or you know, cramps or
anything.

33:45.657 --> 33:46.890
That'll reallly work out.

33:47.960 --> 33:49.280
I'll be right back.

33:52.631 --> 33:56.533
Maybe we should just
drive around the block.

33:56.535 --> 33:58.402
She said she'll be right back.

33:58.404 --> 34:02.105
Yeah, it might take her a
little while to pay for it.

34:05.477 --> 34:08.145
Let's just drive around the
block.

34:08.280 --> 34:10.047
Yeah.
Okay.

34:15.788 --> 34:17.286
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

34:18.757 --> 34:19.956
That house.

34:19.958 --> 34:22.859
That looks familiar.
That's... that's Dusty's house.

34:22.860 --> 34:24.226
Who's Dusty?

34:24.329 --> 34:25.462
It's Mick's cousin.

34:25.531 --> 34:27.898
- Mick's Leslie's husband.
- Ex!

34:27.900 --> 34:29.065
Ex.

34:29.802 --> 34:31.234
That's Mick's car.

34:31.770 --> 34:32.869
They're here!

34:32.971 --> 34:34.905
- My boys are here!
- Hey hey hey!

34:34.907 --> 34:36.273
What are you doing?!

34:36.274 --> 34:37.639
- My boys are inside!
- You got a death wish, huh?

34:37.643 --> 34:39.059
- No!
- I know sweetie.

34:39.060 --> 34:40.476
What do you think, he's going
to just hand them over to you?

34:40.478 --> 34:42.746
He's been hiding them from the
cops for like two weeks!

34:42.748 --> 34:44.047
I'm going in there.

34:44.049 --> 34:45.614
She's right.
This could be dangerous.

34:45.617 --> 34:47.951
We don't even know that they're
in there.

34:47.953 --> 34:48.385
- Okay?
- What!

34:48.387 --> 34:50.920
I know, just hang on.
We can't be stupid about this.

34:50.922 --> 34:53.156
Rose, where are those file
folders that you have?

34:53.158 --> 34:54.858
- They're in the back.
- Okay.

34:54.860 --> 34:56.159
- Wait!
- Hold it!

34:56.228 --> 34:58.628
You think a pageant brochure
is gonna get me my boys back?

34:58.630 --> 35:00.997
I mean no offense, Rose, but...

35:01.133 --> 35:01.631
All right.

35:01.633 --> 35:02.966
Your boys have been out of
school

35:02.968 --> 35:04.234
for like two weeks, right?

35:04.403 --> 35:05.068
Yes!

35:05.070 --> 35:07.003
Charlie, Leo, and James Miller.

35:07.005 --> 35:07.637
- Right?
- Yes!

35:07.639 --> 35:09.239
My feeling is that paperwork

35:09.241 --> 35:11.842
has been started somewhere,
right?

35:11.844 --> 35:12.642
What are you thinking?

35:12.644 --> 35:14.311
I'm thinking that you're
dressed perfectly

35:14.313 --> 35:16.346
for your new job as the
Assistant

35:16.348 --> 35:18.148
to the head of Child
Protective Services.

35:18.150 --> 35:20.417
I'm your boss,
I do the talking.

35:20.419 --> 35:21.751
Let's go!

35:22.321 --> 35:23.620
Please hurry!

35:23.822 --> 35:26.857
Hey, let's go!
I thought you're an actress!

35:27.359 --> 35:28.359
What...

35:28.427 --> 35:30.127
Come on, Annette.

35:30.863 --> 35:31.361
Annette?

35:31.363 --> 35:33.597
We're not
using our real names.

35:33.599 --> 35:35.098
Please!

35:35.167 --> 35:37.734
What if he pulls a weapon?
I have a son, too, you know.

35:37.736 --> 35:39.469
People who were trying to keep
their kids

35:39.471 --> 35:41.571
don't usually pull a weapon on
the authorities.

35:41.573 --> 35:43.073
Why don't we call
that authorities?

35:43.075 --> 35:45.375
We are the authorities.
You and me!

35:45.377 --> 35:48.578
Will you just smile, and look
pretty and serious.

35:48.580 --> 35:50.113
Lemme see that.

35:51.483 --> 35:53.617
Just keep your mouth shut.

36:03.061 --> 36:04.061
What?

36:07.332 --> 36:08.798
Mr. Miller?

36:10.569 --> 36:11.569
Who are you?

36:12.571 --> 36:15.172
I'm... Jasmine Maybelline.

36:15.174 --> 36:15.839
I'm the director of,

36:15.841 --> 36:18.808
Los Angeles Department of
Child Protective Services,

36:18.810 --> 36:20.243
and this is my assistant,
Annette,

36:20.245 --> 36:22.746
and we are here
to speak to a...

36:22.748 --> 36:24.548
"Mick Miller" about the health

36:24.550 --> 36:27.417
and well-being of his
children.

36:28.487 --> 36:29.920
Hold on a minute.

36:30.155 --> 36:30.954
Mick!

36:30.956 --> 36:32.022
What?

36:32.090 --> 36:35.525
Some ladies here to see you.
C.P.S.

36:35.694 --> 36:37.527
Different ones than last time.

36:38.096 --> 36:38.995
Y-Yes!

36:38.997 --> 36:41.298
Unfortunately, our colleagues
who were here

36:41.300 --> 36:43.366
just left a few holes in the
paperwork.

36:43.368 --> 36:47.003
Not a big deal.
Shouldn't take too long to fix.

36:48.340 --> 36:50.040
Yeah?

36:50.375 --> 36:51.741
Are you Mick Miller,

36:51.743 --> 36:56.546
the father of Leo, James, and
Charlie Miller?

36:57.049 --> 36:57.647
Yeah.

36:57.649 --> 36:58.715
We're from C.P.S.

36:58.717 --> 37:01.618
I'm Jasmine and this is my
assistant, Annette.

37:01.620 --> 37:03.353
Yeah, yeah, I already told you.

37:03.422 --> 37:05.488
My kids are staying with my
sister, Sarah, for a while.

37:05.490 --> 37:08.391
Alright, when Leslie ran off,
it about did them in.

37:08.927 --> 37:10.126
I gotta work.

37:10.128 --> 37:11.228
Unfortunately, our colleagues,

37:11.230 --> 37:14.364
when they mixed up the
paperwork,

37:14.633 --> 37:15.465
We...

37:15.467 --> 37:16.466
we're just here to make it
right.

37:16.468 --> 37:18.401
You know, sometimes when
people,

37:18.503 --> 37:20.570
behave in a way that, um,

37:20.572 --> 37:21.738
is unreliable and...

37:21.740 --> 37:24.507
and leaves you
feeling disappointed.

37:24.509 --> 37:27.744
So all we need is just, your
sister's address

37:27.746 --> 37:29.546
and we can be out of your
hair.

37:29.548 --> 37:31.681
It's just to process the file.

37:31.683 --> 37:33.750
You know.
Paperwork.

37:38.624 --> 37:40.824
Will you grab my phone, Dusty?

37:44.863 --> 37:45.428
Paperwork.

37:45.430 --> 37:47.063
- Yeah.
- Paperwork.

37:47.065 --> 37:48.598
It's just...

37:51.536 --> 37:56.840
"113 Hack's Cross
Louisville, Kentucky 40206."

37:56.842 --> 37:59.409
Thank you so much.
Just one more question.

37:59.411 --> 38:03.546
In your estimable opinion,
Mr. Miller, do you feel like,

38:03.548 --> 38:06.716
Sarah is a competent guardian,
temporarily,

38:06.718 --> 38:09.619
for these children while you
work out your...

38:09.621 --> 38:10.387
domestic issues?

38:10.389 --> 38:13.490
No I... I don't got no domestic
issues, all right?

38:13.492 --> 38:17.460
Their mother ran off!
That's called abandonment.

38:17.562 --> 38:18.995
Waiting for the courts
to prove it.

38:18.997 --> 38:21.231
You're not going to give this
to Leslie now, are you?

38:21.233 --> 38:22.699
T-That bitch is crazy!

38:22.834 --> 38:23.733
She's gonna get them boys and

38:23.735 --> 38:24.868
she's going to hurt them
again.

38:24.870 --> 38:26.102
Nope.
This is just for our files.

38:26.104 --> 38:29.673
You've been so helpful.
We're going to get going now.

38:29.675 --> 38:32.542
- Thank you so much.
- Have a good night.

38:33.178 --> 38:34.210
Yeah.

38:34.813 --> 38:37.414
That was amazing!
You could be an actress!

38:37.416 --> 38:38.982
What a waste of skin.

38:38.984 --> 38:42.052
We gotta make a clean getaway.
Come on.

38:42.654 --> 38:43.186
Rose!

38:43.188 --> 38:44.120
Maybelle!
Leslie!

38:44.122 --> 38:45.355
Wait up!
Wait!

38:45.357 --> 38:46.222
Damn!

38:46.325 --> 38:49.059
- Who those dudes? They got...
- Come on!

38:49.061 --> 38:50.327
Get in!

38:52.331 --> 38:53.296
Bitch!

38:53.298 --> 38:54.631
Dusty, get my gun and my keys!
- Go, go, go!

38:54.633 --> 38:56.066
Why'd you leave
me in the first place?

38:56.068 --> 38:57.133
Well, we found Mick.

38:57.135 --> 38:58.034
Where are my kids?

38:58.036 --> 38:59.903
- In Kentucky.
- With his sister?

38:59.905 --> 39:02.138
Someone named Sarah.
You know her?

39:02.240 --> 39:02.806
She's nuts!

39:02.808 --> 39:04.974
She lives in a commune in the
woods.

39:04.976 --> 39:07.043
No phones.
No electricity.

39:07.045 --> 39:08.545
- One of them Dateline cults?
- God!

39:08.547 --> 39:10.780
He's telling everyone
you abandoned them.

39:10.782 --> 39:12.015
What?
No!

39:12.084 --> 39:13.583
- I would never do that!
- We know you didn't.

39:13.585 --> 39:15.685
We'll get your kids even if we
have to

39:15.687 --> 39:16.586
drive to Kentucky to get em.

39:16.588 --> 39:18.455
I don't think we can actually
drive to...

39:18.457 --> 39:20.757
Step on it!
We've got company.

39:23.929 --> 39:25.862
Pull over!
Hey!

39:25.931 --> 39:27.197
Pull over!

39:27.199 --> 39:28.031
They're gonna kill us!

39:28.033 --> 39:30.500
Not if you drive!
Step on it!

39:31.570 --> 39:33.370
They've got a gun!

39:34.573 --> 39:35.472
Pull over!

39:35.474 --> 39:36.706
Watch out!

39:37.476 --> 39:38.675
Come on!
Pull over!

39:44.449 --> 39:48.118
We shook em!
They're gone!

39:48.120 --> 39:49.719
You don't get out much, do you?

39:49.721 --> 39:51.855
Oh my gosh!

39:56.828 --> 39:58.762
Girl, scoot over,
here I come.

39:58.764 --> 40:00.864
Move, girl!
Move!

40:02.033 --> 40:02.832
Should we double-buckle?

40:02.834 --> 40:04.667
Girl, I will strangle you with
that thing!

40:04.669 --> 40:06.569
Don't you harness me.
Let me do my thing.

40:07.773 --> 40:10.907
I think we just got hit, but
what... what happened?

40:10.909 --> 40:13.309
Do you have bulletproof windows
in this thing?

40:13.311 --> 40:16.079
Rick bought this off a client.
A rapper!

40:16.081 --> 40:18.782
It came with added
security features.

40:21.653 --> 40:23.787
Surface wound!
You've got insurance.

40:23.789 --> 40:25.088
This dead ends.

40:25.157 --> 40:28.425
Just sit back and spectate
and let me drive!

40:30.896 --> 40:32.462
Hey, what's going on here?

40:32.464 --> 40:35.265
Just go man, just go, go!

40:37.035 --> 40:40.570
Y'all go on in.
I'm gonna wait right here.

40:44.743 --> 40:46.075
Oh, you out already?

40:46.077 --> 40:49.078
- Good behavior!
- Keep your nose clean.

40:50.182 --> 40:51.548
Working on it.

40:52.317 --> 40:53.783
Thank you.

40:53.919 --> 40:54.451
I told them!

40:54.453 --> 40:56.886
We know where they are, and
what do they do?

40:56.888 --> 40:58.354
Start more paperwork!

40:58.356 --> 41:00.757
The Kentucky police said
it would be Monday before

41:00.759 --> 41:04.093
they could file to start
an official investigation.

41:04.095 --> 41:05.328
Damn paperwork.

41:05.329 --> 41:06.562
You can't wait until Monday for
them to process.

41:06.565 --> 41:08.565
Your kids may be long gone by
then!

41:08.567 --> 41:08.965
Right!

41:08.967 --> 41:10.366
Can't they send someone out?

41:10.368 --> 41:11.201
I mean, they sent someone

41:11.203 --> 41:12.902
to the general area that I
described.

41:12.904 --> 41:15.772
They said that they found
some old burnt building.

41:15.774 --> 41:16.673
I mean, it's ridiculous!

41:16.675 --> 41:19.075
They can pull up her old
library fines and her old

41:19.077 --> 41:23.079
expired DMV records,
but they can't find my kids!

41:23.081 --> 41:24.948
We're not waiting till Monday,
all right?

41:24.950 --> 41:27.617
We're going to get you to
Kentucky.

41:27.853 --> 41:29.519
- All right.
- OK.

41:29.521 --> 41:30.553
Come on.

41:30.555 --> 41:31.721
Let's go.

41:32.224 --> 41:34.023
I know how far it is.
I lived there.

41:34.025 --> 41:36.226
I really don't think I can
drive to Kentucky.

41:36.228 --> 41:38.027
My son comes home tomorrow.
I'm so sorry.

41:38.029 --> 41:40.930
Oh, of course not.
I wouldn't expect you to go.

41:40.932 --> 41:41.931
No, no we're not driving
there.

41:41.933 --> 41:43.533
It would take too long.
He'd get the word out.

41:43.535 --> 41:46.236
By the time you got there,
the kids will be long gone.

41:46.238 --> 41:48.471
Maybelle, I don't have room on
my card

41:48.473 --> 41:50.373
to book a plane ticket.

41:50.375 --> 41:51.174
I do!

41:51.176 --> 41:52.408
I have money.
Lots of it.

41:52.410 --> 41:56.312
Well, I don't, my husband does,
but I have a credit card.

41:56.548 --> 41:59.148
I can fly you to Kentucky.

41:59.251 --> 42:02.352
Wait.
You would, you would do that?

42:02.354 --> 42:03.853
Of course!

42:10.962 --> 42:11.394
What's up?

42:11.396 --> 42:14.030
We're gonna fly Leslie to
Kentucky.

42:14.499 --> 42:15.131
All right.

42:15.133 --> 42:16.933
Let's see.
Nonstop.

42:16.935 --> 42:19.903
Do you prefer economy,
business, or first?

42:19.905 --> 42:22.505
I've... I've never been on a
plane.

42:22.507 --> 42:23.406
- Really?
- No.

42:23.408 --> 42:25.208
Pick whatever's gonna get
her there first.

42:25.210 --> 42:27.911
Well, all seats technically
arrive at the same time.

42:27.913 --> 42:29.212
Just book it!

42:29.281 --> 42:31.648
...business.
More legroom.

42:31.816 --> 42:32.782
Aisle or window?

42:32.784 --> 42:35.418
- I don't...
- Window.

42:35.420 --> 42:38.454
There's a red eye that leaves
from LAX in four hours.

42:38.456 --> 42:39.522
You can make it!

42:39.524 --> 42:42.425
- Thank you so much!
- Of course!

42:42.427 --> 42:43.359
There's only one seat left.

42:43.361 --> 42:45.695
Okay well then book it before
it's gone!

42:47.499 --> 42:49.632
I'm so happy with...

42:49.634 --> 42:52.936
What?!
It says declined!

42:54.706 --> 42:57.173
I bought a dress

42:57.175 --> 43:00.410
in case Rick got an extra
ticket to the Tonys.

43:00.412 --> 43:02.011
Can you return it?

43:02.013 --> 43:02.845
It's not with me.

43:02.847 --> 43:04.480
You haulin' around in this tank

43:04.482 --> 43:06.683
and you ain't got no more than
gas money.

43:06.685 --> 43:08.851
Rick likes to keep low limits
on credit cards.

43:08.853 --> 43:11.454
I bet he ain't got no low
limits on his credit cards.

43:11.456 --> 43:13.489
Let me check my debit.

43:13.858 --> 43:16.826
Money's really not my
strong suit.

43:16.828 --> 43:18.094
I'm sorry.

43:18.096 --> 43:21.264
It looks like you the one
who need a life skills class.

43:21.266 --> 43:27.036
You guys, Bigs just texted,
"Coast not clear. Stay away."

43:27.038 --> 43:28.638
Just get Bigs' credit card.

43:28.640 --> 43:30.807
Bigs ain't got no eight hundred
dollars.

43:30.809 --> 43:32.508
Well, maybe New Haven?

43:32.510 --> 43:33.610
What am I supposed to say?

43:33.612 --> 43:35.912
I need 800 bucks to flee the
program

43:35.914 --> 43:37.580
so I can chase down my kids?

43:37.983 --> 43:39.449
Let me make a call.

43:45.056 --> 43:45.922
Sorry.

43:45.924 --> 43:49.025
She fake... She fake!

43:49.027 --> 43:51.060
It's not for a hair
appointment.

43:51.062 --> 43:52.528
It's an emergency.

43:52.597 --> 43:54.897
OK. This is why you have
an emergency credit card.

43:54.899 --> 43:57.600
With a thousand dollar limit!

43:57.769 --> 44:00.036
Rick, please.

44:00.105 --> 44:00.803
I really need it.

44:00.805 --> 44:02.672
It's just eight hundred
dollars.

44:02.674 --> 44:04.974
Take it from my allowance, now,
come on.

44:04.976 --> 44:06.609
It's not for that wallpaper, is
it?

44:06.611 --> 44:09.145
Because the bathroom does not
need grasscloth, Rose.

44:09.147 --> 44:12.148
No this isn't about wallpaper.
It's an emergency.

44:12.150 --> 44:13.316
It's for a friend.

44:13.718 --> 44:14.718
<i>A loan.</i>

44:14.786 --> 44:18.221
Okay, which one of your
friends needs 800 dollars?

44:18.390 --> 44:20.657
It's for a woman I met at
a shelter today.

44:20.659 --> 44:24.761
Okay, so you want to give a
loan to a homeless person?

44:24.763 --> 44:26.195
You can kiss that goodbye.

44:26.197 --> 44:27.463
<i>And why'd you miss your hair
appointment?</i>

44:27.465 --> 44:29.899
<i>I had to pull strings to get
you...</i>

44:41.446 --> 44:43.479
<i>You've reached
Judge Edward Landry.</i>

44:43.481 --> 44:47.183
<i>Suzanna and I will be
off the grid on safari.</i>

45:49.013 --> 45:50.346
Beverly Hills go on strike?

45:50.348 --> 45:54.484
I never thought it would be so
hard to drum up 800 dollars.

45:54.686 --> 45:56.819
- I'm sorry.
- It's ok.

45:57.388 --> 45:59.922
I got a guy who owes me a
favor.

46:01.192 --> 46:02.492
What kind?

46:02.927 --> 46:04.994
Not what you thinking.

46:05.663 --> 46:07.563
Come on, let's drive.

46:08.099 --> 46:10.666
Leslie girl,
you lucky I love you.

46:21.212 --> 46:22.111
What you got here?

46:22.113 --> 46:23.513
What's in this box?

46:23.515 --> 46:26.015
What is this?

46:26.017 --> 46:28.317
Oh, God!
Oh, my God.

46:30.522 --> 46:31.921
Oh, my God!

46:31.990 --> 46:32.922
That's the creepiest thing I've
ever seen!

46:32.924 --> 46:35.057
What is that?
Why is this in your car?

46:35.059 --> 46:37.426
Let me guess!
It's your talent!

46:37.428 --> 46:39.328
Yes.
That is Lolly.

46:39.330 --> 46:41.364
- Lolly?
- They have names.

46:41.366 --> 46:42.632
What's so funny?

46:43.134 --> 46:47.737
Do you still practice, what is
it, puppeteering?

46:47.739 --> 46:49.572
Ventriloquism?
No, no, no.

46:49.574 --> 46:52.542
She hasn't come out of the
closet in like, fifteen years.

46:52.544 --> 46:55.878
There's no place
like West Hollywood.

46:59.818 --> 47:01.350
He works over there.
Park here.

47:01.352 --> 47:06.656
<i>♪ Call all the ladies out,

47:06.658 --> 47:08.825

47:08.827 --> 47:11.294
<i>♪ A hundred jewels between

47:11.296 --> 47:12.862
I didn't even
know what to bring.

47:12.864 --> 47:15.031
I wasn't even sure what to talk
about.

47:15.033 --> 47:16.632
Life Skills is kind of broad.

47:16.634 --> 47:20.203
So, you thought you'd let
your puppet do it for you?

47:20.205 --> 47:21.971
Man, get out of my way.

47:21.973 --> 47:22.638
Five dollar cover.

47:22.640 --> 47:24.941
- Oh, we're on the guest list.
- We don't have a list.

47:24.943 --> 47:26.159
Denver working the bar.

47:26.160 --> 47:27.376
We just came here to get
something from him.

47:27.378 --> 47:27.810
All of you?

47:27.812 --> 47:28.845
- Yeah.
- Yes, man!

47:28.847 --> 47:30.813
Just coming for some
equipment.

47:30.815 --> 47:32.415
We'll be back out in five.

47:37.322 --> 47:41.824

47:47.966 --> 47:50.333
I'll go find Denver.

47:59.344 --> 48:01.344
Hello, West Hollywood!

48:01.346 --> 48:03.646
How are LA's
finest doing tonight?

48:05.316 --> 48:09.452
Who wants to see us crown this
year's Showdown Show Queen?

48:11.122 --> 48:14.423
She is so pretty.
Look at her hair.

48:14.425 --> 48:15.091
Yeah, I think she's a

48:15.093 --> 48:17.693
different kind of queen than
you're used to.

48:17.695 --> 48:18.695
Oh...

48:21.432 --> 48:22.765
Ooh, lights on!

48:22.767 --> 48:26.802
As you know, contestants will
compete in evening gown,

48:26.804 --> 48:28.037
interview,

48:28.039 --> 48:29.972
and our finalists will share
their lovely talent.

48:29.974 --> 48:32.541
They're having a
pageant!

48:32.543 --> 48:34.677
Tonight's Queen will earn the
title,

48:34.679 --> 48:35.711
a one year membership to

48:35.713 --> 48:39.215
Frenchie's Fabulous Fitness
Dancing Classes,

48:39.217 --> 48:40.416
and a custom made purse,

48:40.418 --> 48:44.220
filled with fifteen hundred
dollars in cash!

48:44.222 --> 48:46.022
Check out this purse.
Custom made.

48:46.024 --> 48:48.324
Fifteen hundred dollars in
cash!

48:48.826 --> 48:50.026
Be cool, be cool.

48:50.028 --> 48:51.827
Jeez, come on.

48:51.829 --> 48:52.695
The party is about to start.

48:52.697 --> 48:55.464
So, liquor up, and we'll see
you in twenty.

48:55.466 --> 48:57.466
All right, get out.
Just leave.

48:57.468 --> 48:58.467
That queen owes me but says

48:58.469 --> 49:01.037
she isn't going to pay up
tonight, so,

49:01.039 --> 49:03.539
we need a plan C if we
gonna get you on that plane.

49:03.541 --> 49:04.674
I think I got one.

49:04.676 --> 49:06.008
Whoever wins that purse
tonight

49:06.010 --> 49:08.210
gets fifteen hundred dollars,
right?

49:08.212 --> 49:09.478
Right?

49:09.480 --> 49:11.247
So, we're going to win it!

49:11.249 --> 49:13.349
Specifically, you!

49:13.351 --> 49:14.684
What?!
No, no.

49:14.752 --> 49:17.320
I'm... I'm not a "queen"
like that I'm not...

49:17.322 --> 49:17.954
I saw this movie once.

49:17.956 --> 49:20.790
The actress who played Mary
Poppins she was a woman

49:20.792 --> 49:24.293
who dressed as a man,
who dressed like a woman.

49:24.295 --> 49:25.494
So, you're an actress.

49:25.496 --> 49:27.663
You just gonna dress like a
queen.

49:27.665 --> 49:29.765
OK, there are so many problems
with that plan.

49:29.767 --> 49:31.334
Don't even get me started.

49:31.336 --> 49:35.371
Why?
You won Miss Arizona, right?

49:35.373 --> 49:36.372
Yeah, but...

49:36.374 --> 49:38.574
But this is just...
you know...

49:38.576 --> 49:42.945
You got a car full of talent.
You got gowns, you got outfits.

49:42.947 --> 49:46.949
- You even have a crown.
- But, she's not a man.

49:46.951 --> 49:48.918
You identify as a woman, right?

49:48.920 --> 49:50.720
- Of course, but...
- Of course.

49:50.722 --> 49:55.124
So, in a lot of people's book
that would qualify you.

49:55.126 --> 49:56.659
Where is your makeup?

49:57.028 --> 49:58.094
- In the car.
- Great.

49:58.096 --> 50:00.930
You know you can't just turn up
and enter these things.

50:00.932 --> 50:04.567
There's always a procedure.
There's forms to fill out.

50:04.836 --> 50:06.135
Paperwork.

50:06.504 --> 50:09.805
I'll take care of
it.

50:14.679 --> 50:15.678
Where did you find it?

50:15.680 --> 50:18.447
Don't worry about it, Princess.
I gotcha.

50:21.452 --> 50:22.351
Oh.

50:22.353 --> 50:24.920
Can't you see the place is
occupied?

50:26.691 --> 50:29.825
It looks great, okay.

50:34.198 --> 50:36.599
Wow.
Um...

50:37.668 --> 50:40.770
Let's do this!

50:40.772 --> 50:41.971
Yes!

50:49.047 --> 50:51.680
Ginger Marie Minj.

50:51.682 --> 50:54.917
Destiny Elizabeth Child.
What?

50:54.919 --> 50:56.352
Did you steal my lashes?

50:56.354 --> 50:58.254
Why would I steal your lashes,
girl?

50:58.256 --> 51:01.023
I don't like arachnophobia.
I have arachnophobia.

51:01.025 --> 51:03.059
I like a nice, subtle daytime
lash.

51:03.061 --> 51:05.428
I know you try to give
me side- eye but you can't see...

51:05.430 --> 51:09.131
you can't see through those
crusty ass caterpillars you got.

51:09.133 --> 51:11.100
That's ok, that's ok!

51:11.102 --> 51:14.470
You ain't gonna steal
nothing you never took...

51:14.472 --> 51:16.872
Oh, hey honey.
Can we help you?

51:17.108 --> 51:18.407
Are you lost?

51:19.343 --> 51:22.378
- You are so beautiful.
- I know.

51:23.281 --> 51:25.247
Well, hello darling.

51:25.249 --> 51:25.815
Hi.

51:25.817 --> 51:29.118
Welcome to our
lair.

51:29.120 --> 51:32.288
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

51:32.290 --> 51:35.791
Only contestant teams
are allowed in back.

51:35.793 --> 51:38.227
Great,
then we're in the right place.

51:38.229 --> 51:40.596
Oh!
And you are?

51:40.598 --> 51:43.099
We're her team.
Uh, this is...

51:43.101 --> 51:44.300
"Arizona Night."

51:44.302 --> 51:45.734
We just landed.
Flight delayed.

51:45.736 --> 51:47.336
So if you could shoo-shoo,
flutter-flutter,

51:47.338 --> 51:50.406
so we could prep Miss Arizona
for the Showdown.

51:51.142 --> 51:52.007
How do you do?

51:52.009 --> 51:54.076
Mm-Hmm.
You're not on my list.

51:54.078 --> 51:54.977
She certainly is.

51:54.979 --> 51:57.046
Maybe you just lost the
paperwork.

51:57.048 --> 51:59.548
I don't lose
paperwork.

51:59.550 --> 52:02.551
So you saying you ain't never
lose anything before?

52:02.553 --> 52:04.153
You never lose your
mama's lipstick?

52:04.155 --> 52:06.689
You ain't ever lose the
championship soccer game

52:06.691 --> 52:09.492
'cause sports just wasn't yo
"thing?"

52:10.428 --> 52:11.127
You never lose your mind

52:11.129 --> 52:13.963
when an election didn't go
your way?

52:13.965 --> 52:15.865
- I didn't know...
- Nah!

52:15.933 --> 52:18.567
See, Miss Arizona ain't no
loser.

52:18.569 --> 52:19.535
She came here to win.

52:19.537 --> 52:21.370
Now, we done taped her and
padded her

52:21.372 --> 52:22.872
and flew all the way in
business class

52:22.874 --> 52:24.740
from Phoenix, Arizona to help
her.

52:24.742 --> 52:28.711
Now you gone help us?
Or, you gonna help us?

52:30.248 --> 52:31.747
We don't allow silicone.

52:31.749 --> 52:34.016
- They're not silicone.
- I got a waiver.

52:34.018 --> 52:36.585
We'll set up right
over there in the corner.

52:36.587 --> 52:38.888
Come on.
Let's go.

52:39.824 --> 52:41.490
Come on, ladies.

52:45.029 --> 52:47.163
Did you see the way she told
Braxton?

52:47.165 --> 52:50.099
Did you see that?

52:50.101 --> 52:54.670
Oh my God... ain't nobody
talked to her like that!

52:57.275 --> 52:58.841
There's hairspray in that bag.

52:58.843 --> 53:00.142
Lower your voice.

53:00.144 --> 53:01.110
Oh, sorry.

53:01.112 --> 53:03.412
No, no.
Like, "lower it."

53:03.414 --> 53:06.148
Like a man.
Speak from here.

53:06.317 --> 53:07.850
Like this?

53:07.919 --> 53:11.520
Nah, like you're dealing with
an Adam's apple and stuff.

53:11.522 --> 53:13.489
Like... like this?

53:13.491 --> 53:14.256
Um, better.

53:14.258 --> 53:17.159
Okay, let's work on your
introduction.

53:17.161 --> 53:20.462
Okay, um... Hi,
I'm Rose Raynes.

53:20.464 --> 53:21.864
No, no.
You're Arizona Night.

53:21.866 --> 53:23.365
But that sounds like a
stripper's name.

53:23.367 --> 53:26.202
Perfect.
Tell us all about yourself.

53:26.204 --> 53:26.635
Um,

53:26.637 --> 53:30.406
I like...
basketball?

53:30.408 --> 53:31.507
No, no, no, no.

53:31.509 --> 53:33.309
This is an opportunity for you
to tell us

53:33.311 --> 53:35.244
who you really are, what you
really like.

53:35.246 --> 53:37.913
You know, like shopping and
shopping,

53:37.915 --> 53:38.948
and sitting by the pool all
day,

53:38.950 --> 53:42.117
- drinking mimosas, whatever.
- That's not what I do all day.

53:42.119 --> 53:42.585
Seriously?

53:42.587 --> 53:44.119
That's what I would do, if I
were you.

53:44.121 --> 53:45.721
Anyway.

53:45.723 --> 53:47.856
Go ahead.
Continue.

53:48.459 --> 53:50.526
Did you see Arizona's ankles?
She fish!

53:50.528 --> 53:52.428
Girl, who cares if
she's fish.

53:52.430 --> 53:54.163
She can't enter this
competition.

53:54.165 --> 53:55.130
We don't do bio-queens.

53:55.132 --> 53:56.432
I'm gonna take care of it,

53:56.434 --> 53:58.934
babe, I told you that, okay?

53:58.936 --> 54:00.769
What you gonna do?

54:00.771 --> 54:02.605
You better, because if I don't
win,

54:02.607 --> 54:06.008
I don't get my show and you
don't get your commission.

54:10.781 --> 54:12.414
Braxton!
How come there ain't nothin'

54:12.416 --> 54:13.382
but carrots in that
green room?

54:13.384 --> 54:15.451
What the hell we supposed to
do with vegetables?

54:15.453 --> 54:17.319
You ain't running no bunny
pageant.

54:17.321 --> 54:19.154
Okay, see.

54:19.490 --> 54:21.323
- What?
- Seriously?

54:21.325 --> 54:22.024
Seriously.

54:22.026 --> 54:26.895
You better check that attitude.
You better check that attitude!

54:30.268 --> 54:33.569
Ooooooh!

54:34.305 --> 54:36.038
I got it, I got it.

54:36.407 --> 54:37.840
- Here.
- OK.

54:38.276 --> 54:41.677
Has anyone
seen a pair of gloves?

54:42.079 --> 54:44.513
All right, let's go watch.

54:44.515 --> 54:45.681
All right?

54:45.683 --> 54:47.683
Go out and fight.
Keep it soft and pretty.

54:47.685 --> 54:49.918
Aww!
Hug!

54:52.690 --> 54:54.923
All right, let's go!
Come on.

54:55.393 --> 54:58.694
I really wish I hadn't bought
that dress.

54:58.696 --> 55:01.230
Yeah.
Me, too.

55:01.232 --> 55:04.099
Hey, nice work with the pageant
hair.

55:04.635 --> 55:08.704
Miss Pasadena, 1996!

55:11.842 --> 55:13.809
You look beautiful.

55:14.078 --> 55:15.444
Thank you.

55:15.446 --> 55:16.478
All right.

55:17.248 --> 55:19.048
Go get em.

55:19.717 --> 55:21.417
What's up, party people?

55:22.453 --> 55:24.987
Tonight, you're in the right
spot watching me on stage

55:24.989 --> 55:26.188

55:26.190 --> 55:29.558
some of the most beautiful
girls ever!

55:29.560 --> 55:30.826
Seven of the most...

55:31.095 --> 55:32.494
Dude.

55:33.197 --> 55:35.898
What?

55:36.600 --> 55:38.267

Okay, thank you.

55:38.269 --> 55:41.670
You tell me now.
Now's the time you tell me.

55:42.006 --> 55:44.173
Eight beautiful contestants!

55:44.175 --> 55:44.773
Without further ado,

55:44.775 --> 55:47.843

57:38.489 --> 57:40.589
beautiful, amazing and
georgous!

57:40.591 --> 57:41.323
Oh, my God.
Hot!

57:41.325 --> 57:44.693
While these beauties get ready
for the evening gown competition,

57:44.695 --> 57:46.962
this is your time to mix and
mingle, get loose,

57:46.964 --> 57:49.698
head to the bar and we'll
see you in fifteen.

57:50.434 --> 57:51.967
Hello, Rose.

57:54.839 --> 57:56.071
Gary?

57:57.074 --> 57:59.408
So, this was your event?

58:00.411 --> 58:01.410
Ta dah!

58:01.412 --> 58:02.544
Okay, Princess.

58:02.546 --> 58:04.780
Evening gowns!
Come on!

58:08.252 --> 58:09.885
Hey, what's wrong?

58:10.054 --> 58:12.988
That woman, Emerald,
is actually a man named Gary.

58:12.990 --> 58:15.123
Honey, I think they're all men
named Gary.

58:15.125 --> 58:16.875
Oh, no.
I mean I know him.

58:16.876 --> 58:18.626
He's my friend's husband.
He works for Rick's talent agency!

58:18.629 --> 58:19.428
For real?
He's here?

58:19.430 --> 58:22.130
Looks like he's got a hidden
talent of his own, huh!

58:22.132 --> 58:24.533
He knows I'm not a...
He'll turn us in!

58:24.535 --> 58:26.201
No, no, no.
It's better than that.

58:26.203 --> 58:28.670
He knows that you know
he's your friend's husband.

58:28.672 --> 58:30.839
Yeah, well, no.
He's got more to lose than you do.

58:30.841 --> 58:33.342
Okay, but if he turns us in,
I will be disqualified.

58:33.344 --> 58:35.677
Then, how will we get the
money?

58:35.779 --> 58:37.045
Arizona Night!

58:37.047 --> 58:38.280
I need you, stat!

58:38.282 --> 58:39.214
They know!

58:39.216 --> 58:40.782
He told!
I knew it!

58:40.784 --> 58:42.751
- What do I say?
- You!

58:43.120 --> 58:43.785
Arizona!

58:43.787 --> 58:46.355
I need your music
for the talent?

58:47.525 --> 58:48.423
Music!
On it.

58:48.425 --> 58:50.125
- Who's got it?
- Of course.

58:50.127 --> 58:51.660
Yes, Jasmine,
could you get it?

58:51.662 --> 58:53.395
It's... um,
in that case right there.

58:53.397 --> 58:54.496
Shania Twain?

58:54.498 --> 58:56.999
I was like 13.
I was in a country phase.

58:58.602 --> 58:59.434
Thanks!

58:59.436 --> 59:00.602
Oh, you rude.

59:00.771 --> 59:01.670
Come on.
Let's get you in this.

59:01.672 --> 59:03.939
Okay, let's go behind
the clothing racks.

59:03.941 --> 59:05.307
I seen more skin in this place
in the last 20 minutes

59:05.309 --> 59:08.844
- I seen in my whole life.
- Yeah, but I have a few parts I need to hide!

59:08.846 --> 59:10.379
Fine, I got it.
I got it, I got it.

59:10.381 --> 59:12.347
- We need you on stage, stat!
- You good?

59:12.349 --> 59:14.449
Sammy, let's go watch.
Okay.

59:18.589 --> 59:19.121
Well, hey y'all!

59:19.123 --> 59:21.323
It's the mouth of the south
here provin' that

59:21.325 --> 59:22.624
some gingers do have souls.

59:22.626 --> 59:25.761
And tonight, if you vote for
me for Showdown Show Queen,

59:25.763 --> 59:29.197
you and I can do some good
for those kids at base camp.

59:30.301 --> 59:33.969
You're going to need to state
your name and your causes, okay?

59:35.205 --> 59:36.838
My cause.
What's my cause?

59:36.840 --> 59:38.507
Just talk about your brochures
or something.

59:38.509 --> 59:40.742
I don't know.
It's not your first rodeo.

59:40.744 --> 59:43.545
Sweetheart, we all know you
support the NRA.

59:43.547 --> 59:45.581
I brought the guns tonight.

59:46.383 --> 59:47.716
Buongiorno!

59:47.718 --> 59:49.551
I'm Luscious... as they come

59:49.553 --> 59:52.120
and I am thrilled to bring
attention

59:52.122 --> 59:56.758
to the Astraea Lesbian
Foundation for Justice.

59:57.361 --> 01:00:01.597
Now, introducing Miss Arizona
Night!

01:00:11.842 --> 01:00:12.908
Good evening,
ladies and gentlemen.

01:00:12.910 --> 01:00:20.449
I'm Arizona Night and I'm
here to show support for...

01:00:21.552 --> 01:00:24.386
the New Haven Women's Shelter.

01:00:24.388 --> 01:00:28.357
May we all dare
to hope and dream.

01:00:30.394 --> 01:00:31.960
Thank you, Arizona.

01:00:31.962 --> 01:00:35.130
Last,
but certainly not least,

01:00:35.566 --> 01:00:37.265
Miss Delilah!

01:00:38.802 --> 01:00:42.304
Don't you mean save the best
for last?

01:00:42.306 --> 01:00:43.405
Hi.
I'm Delilah,

01:00:43.407 --> 01:00:45.207
the host of your local Talk
Truth show.

01:00:45.209 --> 01:00:47.042
And I'm delighted to be here
tonight

01:00:47.044 --> 01:00:49.611
as an authentic
champion for gay rights.

01:00:49.613 --> 01:00:50.345
Tonight, I plan on donating

01:00:50.347 --> 01:00:53.315
half of my prize money to the
True Colors Foundation,

01:00:53.317 --> 01:00:55.617
and I hope to inspire all
the contestants

01:00:55.619 --> 01:00:58.253
to reveal their
true colors.

01:01:01.558 --> 01:01:02.791
"Hello."

01:01:02.793 --> 01:01:05.394
- "This is crazy!"
- You are so weird.

01:01:05.396 --> 01:01:07.262
What?
I'm not weird.

01:01:07.264 --> 01:01:08.563
I'm totally normal.

01:01:08.565 --> 01:01:09.998
Do you
remember how to do this?

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:12.401
Yeah, is it kind of like riding
a bike, or what?

01:01:12.403 --> 01:01:14.903
Riding a bike.

01:01:14.905 --> 01:01:17.172
Oh my god!
You just threw your voice!

01:01:18.375 --> 01:01:19.708
No, no!

01:01:19.710 --> 01:01:22.744
Well, I don't do monologues.

01:01:23.781 --> 01:01:25.647
- Jesse to Braxton.
- Braxton to Jessee.

01:01:25.783 --> 01:01:31.186
- Jesse to Braxton.
- Braxton to Jesse, hello?

01:01:32.423 --> 01:01:37.959
<i>Our first finalist is Delilah,
dancing to... Slave!</i>

01:01:37.961 --> 01:01:41.697
I'm sure Emerald is loving
that.

01:01:42.099 --> 01:01:43.632
Are they a thing?

01:01:43.634 --> 01:01:46.935
Delilah's the puppet,
Emerald's the strings,

01:01:46.937 --> 01:01:50.672
literally and legally.
He's Delilah's agent.

01:01:50.674 --> 01:01:53.875
Hot Hollywood gossip, but you
didn't hear that from me.

01:01:53.877 --> 01:01:56.745
Stay out of their way.
Delilah needs to win this title tonight.

01:01:56.747 --> 01:02:01.116
Thinks it's gonna to get her talk
show picked up by a network.

01:02:04.154 --> 01:02:06.788
How long have you known
Emerald?

01:02:08.025 --> 01:02:11.860
A year or so.
She's pretty new to the scene.

01:02:12.496 --> 01:02:14.563
Where are you from, honey?

01:02:14.998 --> 01:02:16.198
Arizona.

01:02:16.834 --> 01:02:18.533
Of course.

01:02:19.670 --> 01:02:21.870
and what are you running from?

01:02:23.440 --> 01:02:24.239
Nothing.

01:02:24.241 --> 01:02:26.875
This is a long way from
Arizona.

01:02:27.878 --> 01:02:29.511
Yeah,
I guess so.

01:02:31.115 --> 01:02:33.048
How long have you been
doing this?

01:02:33.684 --> 01:02:34.983
Competing?

01:02:35.519 --> 01:02:36.318
Sure.

01:02:36.320 --> 01:02:41.490
Child, I've been performing onstage
since I was about 17 years old.

01:02:41.859 --> 01:02:46.161
My mom accepted me as is,
my dad... didn't.

01:02:46.263 --> 01:02:49.598
So, after he moved out,

01:02:50.033 --> 01:02:52.934
Lucious moved in and I came
out.

01:02:52.936 --> 01:02:55.137
Junior year of high school.

01:02:55.139 --> 01:02:57.105
What does your puppet do?

01:02:57.641 --> 01:03:00.475
Lolly?
We sing duets.

01:03:00.477 --> 01:03:04.246
Now is it hard to talk and sing
through your mouth like that?

01:03:04.248 --> 01:03:06.615
Not once you get the hang of
it.

01:03:06.884 --> 01:03:08.683
It's actually kind of nice
sometimes.

01:03:08.685 --> 01:03:11.186
Being able to say whatever you
want.

01:03:11.255 --> 01:03:11.853
I heard that!

01:03:11.855 --> 01:03:13.388
<i>Let's here it for Delilah!</i>

01:03:13.390 --> 01:03:15.791
<i>- Our second finalist is Ginger.
- Yay!</i>

01:03:15.793 --> 01:03:17.926
Work it out, Ginger!
Yes!

01:03:17.928 --> 01:03:21.029
- Let them have it!
- What is your talent!

01:03:21.031 --> 01:03:23.698
I salsa dance.

01:03:23.700 --> 01:03:26.501
- Oh!
- But, I'm not dancing tonight

01:03:26.503 --> 01:03:28.470
because I have a bad ankle.

01:03:28.472 --> 01:03:30.539
But, what if they call your
name?

01:03:30.541 --> 01:03:31.873
They won't.

01:03:31.875 --> 01:03:33.542
I already told them.

01:03:33.811 --> 01:03:36.812
I'm just wearing this because
it's comfortable.

01:03:36.814 --> 01:03:38.513
I made it myself.

01:03:38.515 --> 01:03:40.048
You make costumes?

01:03:40.050 --> 01:03:42.884
Day job.
I work in theater.

01:03:42.886 --> 01:03:45.654
Wait, so are you out
of the competition, then?

01:03:45.656 --> 01:03:48.256
Most of us aren't here to win
a crown.

01:03:48.258 --> 01:03:49.157
Gazelle just likes to sing.

01:03:49.159 --> 01:03:53.061
Sunshine is an insurance broker
that lives in the valley.

01:03:53.063 --> 01:03:55.230
For some of us, it's a
platform.

01:03:55.599 --> 01:03:59.000
For all of us, it is an art
form.

01:03:59.369 --> 01:04:02.804
A way of feeling beautiful.

01:04:03.207 --> 01:04:04.472
So, you don't care about the
money?

01:04:04.474 --> 01:04:09.277
Oh honey, I stopped leanin' on
the green a long time ago.

01:04:09.346 --> 01:04:10.512
You know what they say.

01:04:10.514 --> 01:04:14.783
The love of money is the root
of all evils.

01:04:14.785 --> 01:04:16.251
That is true.

01:04:16.887 --> 01:04:19.988
But tonight,
I could really use the money.

01:04:21.892 --> 01:04:24.492
And, what would you do with it?

01:04:25.796 --> 01:04:27.495
Something important.

01:04:28.398 --> 01:04:29.398
Hmm.

01:04:31.401 --> 01:04:35.203
Well, Arizona,
good luck to you.

01:04:35.205 --> 01:04:37.038
I need to reapply.

01:04:37.474 --> 01:04:40.108
Arizona?
They're looking for you.

01:04:42.546 --> 01:04:47.048
Slay them sister!
Slay them!

01:04:48.986 --> 01:04:50.285
Thank you.

01:04:51.188 --> 01:04:52.287
You're welcome.

I told you I
would take care of it.

01:05:13.710 --> 01:05:16.578

- I'm trying!

01:05:16.580 --> 01:05:18.046

No!

01:07:59.209 --> 01:08:00.675
I have it on video.

01:08:00.877 --> 01:08:02.644
Delilah, tame yourself!

01:08:03.180 --> 01:08:04.312
Delilah!

01:08:04.314 --> 01:08:05.780
Back.
Off!

01:08:05.782 --> 01:08:07.315
She ain't no drag queen.

01:08:07.317 --> 01:08:08.783
What are you saying?

01:08:08.785 --> 01:08:10.652
I'm saying she is a she!

01:08:10.654 --> 01:08:13.421
Emerald just told me she works
with her husband.

01:08:14.091 --> 01:08:14.589
What?

01:08:14.591 --> 01:08:16.925
Is that true, Arizona?

01:08:17.094 --> 01:08:18.725
And she stole my gloves.

01:08:18.728 --> 01:08:23.163
Ladies, meet Miss Rose Raynes,
aka Miss Arizona.

01:08:23.567 --> 01:08:25.867
And now, why you got to come
invade our show?

01:08:25.868 --> 01:08:28.036
No woman's stealing my show!

01:08:28.037 --> 01:08:29.404
Wait.
Stop.

01:08:30.240 --> 01:08:32.207
She did it for me.

01:08:32.408 --> 01:08:34.609
My ex-husband did this,

01:08:34.611 --> 01:08:37.112
and he also shipped my kids off
to Kentucky and

01:08:37.113 --> 01:08:39.447
if we don't get there before
he does tonight,

01:08:39.448 --> 01:08:41.483
I may never see them again.

01:08:41.484 --> 01:08:43.785
So, please.

01:08:44.287 --> 01:08:46.654
What does this have to do
with that?

01:08:46.656 --> 01:08:47.755
Okay?

01:08:47.858 --> 01:08:49.836
Because we needed the money to
get there.

01:08:49.859 --> 01:08:52.660
That's all!
And we just thought Miss Arizona could win.

01:08:52.662 --> 01:08:53.428
No offense, y'all.

01:08:53.430 --> 01:08:55.296
No offense, y'all,
but there's

01:08:55.298 --> 01:08:57.999
a whole lot of other ways to
make a little bit of money.

01:08:58.001 --> 01:09:00.602
Okay!?

01:09:00.737 --> 01:09:03.238
You know what?
You're right, and we tried.

01:09:03.240 --> 01:09:06.006
I'm so sorry.
I didn't mean to take anything from you.

01:09:06.009 --> 01:09:09.077
I was...
I was just trying to help.

01:09:11.548 --> 01:09:13.481
Come on, let's go.

01:09:14.651 --> 01:09:15.884
Stop!

01:09:15.952 --> 01:09:18.653
You're not going anywhere,
until you've got your money.

01:09:18.654 --> 01:09:20.020
Her money?

01:09:20.023 --> 01:09:23.124
- She can't compete!
- And, who are you?

01:09:23.560 --> 01:09:27.060
Why are you here?
Why are we all here?

01:09:27.497 --> 01:09:29.130
This is not about winning.

01:09:30.901 --> 01:09:32.100
- Destiny.
- Yes?

01:09:32.102 --> 01:09:35.270
Your sequined outfit costs
twice as much as this prize.

01:09:35.272 --> 01:09:36.837
Well, that is true,
I mean, but really.

01:09:36.840 --> 01:09:39.439
We're here being true
to who we are,

01:09:39.442 --> 01:09:42.911
which most of the world
doesn't want us to be.

01:09:43.380 --> 01:09:47.582
So, if we're going to continue
to demand love,

01:09:47.751 --> 01:09:50.518
then we need to start giving
it, girls.

01:09:51.453 --> 01:09:52.520
Okay?

01:09:53.089 --> 01:09:56.157
I, for one, don't think that
what Miss Arizona is doing

01:09:56.159 --> 01:09:57.725
is really all that bad.

01:09:57.727 --> 01:09:58.860
Me, neither!

01:09:58.862 --> 01:10:02.197
Well, I do!
And I'm telling Braxton!

01:10:02.332 --> 01:10:04.032
Miss Thing?

01:10:04.267 --> 01:10:05.300
You tell Braxton,

01:10:05.302 --> 01:10:07.702
and I will show him the video
that Miss Ginger just took

01:10:07.704 --> 01:10:10.405
of what you did to Miss
Arizona's personal property,

01:10:10.407 --> 01:10:13.741
to the cop that's out in the audience.

01:10:13.743 --> 01:10:16.377
Two different angles!

01:10:16.379 --> 01:10:19.447
He's not here to do the YMCA.

01:10:19.449 --> 01:10:21.182
Oh, come on...

01:10:32.329 --> 01:10:36.397
You know, I wore this dress
when I won Miss Arizona.

01:10:37.300 --> 01:10:38.800
It's okay, Sweetheart.

01:10:38.802 --> 01:10:40.868
You can borrow anything of
mine.

01:10:40.870 --> 01:10:41.302
Anything!

01:10:41.304 --> 01:10:43.771
Girl, what's she supposed to do
with, use that as a tent?

01:10:43.773 --> 01:10:44.872
Oh, step down!

01:10:44.874 --> 01:10:47.275
I made half of your costumes.
Okay?

01:10:47.277 --> 01:10:49.544
- That's gonna require a lot of stuffing.
- Oh, please.

01:10:49.546 --> 01:10:51.379
I'm just saying,
she got to stuff a lot.

01:10:51.381 --> 01:10:53.648
Look, we can piece something
together.

01:10:53.650 --> 01:10:55.149
You're gonna be fine.

01:11:01.324 --> 01:11:03.591
I... is your radio on?

01:11:05.595 --> 01:11:07.428
The jig is up, Rose.

01:11:07.430 --> 01:11:08.830
Or what, Gary?

01:11:08.832 --> 01:11:11.165
The way I see it you have
a lot more to lose than I do

01:11:11.167 --> 01:11:12.900
with our little run in,
tonight.

01:11:12.902 --> 01:11:14.135
Oh, Sweetheart!

01:11:14.137 --> 01:11:16.838
Before you bring this up
at the company picnic,

01:11:16.840 --> 01:11:17.805
take a look out there.

01:11:17.807 --> 01:11:21.776
There's Cliff, there's Emily,
and there's your little friend.

01:11:22.012 --> 01:11:23.177
- Vicki?
- Yeah, Vicki.

01:11:23.179 --> 01:11:26.648
Vicki knows, Bev knows,
everybody knows.

01:11:26.650 --> 01:11:29.217
I know how to take
care of the clients.

01:11:29.219 --> 01:11:30.285
Now, look.

01:11:30.287 --> 01:11:32.186
I don't know who put you up to
this charade,

01:11:32.188 --> 01:11:34.422
and I don't know what you're
looking for,

01:11:34.424 --> 01:11:36.624
but you're not gonna find it
here.

01:11:37.794 --> 01:11:39.027
So...

01:11:39.095 --> 01:11:43.264
I think it's time for you to
go home, Rose.

01:11:43.266 --> 01:11:45.199
It's past your bedtime.

01:11:46.102 --> 01:11:48.936
Eight hundred dollars
for me to drop out.

01:11:48.938 --> 01:11:50.605
That's easy.

01:11:50.607 --> 01:11:53.374
I'll wire it to you in the
morning.

01:11:53.376 --> 01:11:54.909
<i>Each finalist will join me</i>

01:11:54.911 --> 01:11:58.246
<i>onstage to answer one last
question.</i>

01:11:58.248 --> 01:12:00.214
That will be too late.

01:12:00.216 --> 01:12:02.216
Good luck to Delilah.

01:12:04.654 --> 01:12:06.721
I'll be right back.

01:12:07.123 --> 01:12:08.856
And, audience!
That's when we throw to you.

01:12:08.858 --> 01:12:10.358
Her kids are going to be gone
in she doesn't get there.

01:12:10.360 --> 01:12:13.995
- I mean, why would I dress in drag for no reason?
- I know, I can help you.

01:12:13.997 --> 01:12:15.163
- I'm going to help you.
- Yeah?

01:12:15.165 --> 01:12:16.497
Yes.
I got this.

01:12:16.599 --> 01:12:19.200
Our first finalist is like a
cool glass of sweet tea.

01:12:19.202 --> 01:12:21.569
Miss Ginger!

01:12:21.571 --> 01:12:23.338
Hello, Miss Ginger.

01:12:24.207 --> 01:12:24.605
Tell us.

01:12:24.607 --> 01:12:27.842
What does it mean to you to be
beautiful?

01:12:28.278 --> 01:12:29.510
Thank you.

01:12:29.679 --> 01:12:35.283
To me, beauty means finding the
light in all of the darkness.

01:12:35.285 --> 01:12:36.818
I may never be the pretty one,

01:12:36.820 --> 01:12:39.354
but I will always be the
beautiful one.

01:12:40.757 --> 01:12:45.293
Our next finalist, the one and
only, Delilah!

01:12:45.295 --> 01:12:48.363
Hello, Miss Delilah.

01:12:50.367 --> 01:12:51.599
Delilah,

01:12:51.835 --> 01:12:54.869
what does it mean to you to be
beautiful?

01:12:55.705 --> 01:12:57.638
Thank you, esteemed judges and
panel.

01:12:57.640 --> 01:13:01.075
Being beautiful to me means
taking time to honor

01:13:01.077 --> 01:13:03.044
the inner queen you are.

01:13:03.046 --> 01:13:05.146
And I have a big inner queen
in me.

01:13:07.684 --> 01:13:08.316
What is it?

01:13:08.318 --> 01:13:09.584
It's my husband's best
friend,

01:13:09.586 --> 01:13:12.220
and he owes me a huge favor.

01:13:12.789 --> 01:13:14.622
Arizona!

01:13:16.926 --> 01:13:19.093
- <i>Arizona?</i>
- It's in here somewhere.

01:13:19.095 --> 01:13:22.530
- They're calling my name.
- Just, just go.

01:13:22.532 --> 01:13:24.699
Arizona, they need you.

01:13:26.770 --> 01:13:29.871
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

01:13:29.873 --> 01:13:30.538
Nice dress!

01:13:30.540 --> 01:13:32.907
All right, Arizona.
Let's get serious.

01:13:32.909 --> 01:13:33.875
You got to tell us.

01:13:33.877 --> 01:13:37.712
What does it mean to you to be
beautiful?

01:13:42.919 --> 01:13:45.153
Go on, girl!

01:13:46.723 --> 01:13:48.055
I was born into a world

01:13:48.057 --> 01:13:50.858
where I was trained from the
time I was a little girl

01:13:50.860 --> 01:13:53.761
to sit still and look pretty.

01:13:54.297 --> 01:13:55.062
But, as I've grown,

01:13:55.064 --> 01:13:59.000
I've learned that outer beauty
can hide a hollow shell.

01:13:59.769 --> 01:14:01.068
Friendship.

01:14:01.070 --> 01:14:04.405
Being kind.
Helping others.

01:14:05.175 --> 01:14:07.475
Looking out for those
who need us most.

01:14:07.477 --> 01:14:09.577
And doing whatever it takes

01:14:09.579 --> 01:14:11.245
to be there for them.

01:14:12.215 --> 01:14:13.915
That's what makes us beautiful.

01:14:15.552 --> 01:14:17.652
Arizona, please clarify.

01:14:17.654 --> 01:14:19.954
You said "since I was a little
girl?"

01:14:20.790 --> 01:14:21.789
If that statement is true,

01:14:21.791 --> 01:14:24.358
technically, you'd be
disqualified.

01:14:24.594 --> 01:14:27.528
- Disqualify her!
- Go enter Miss America!

01:14:27.530 --> 01:14:28.696
She did the right paperwork!

01:14:28.698 --> 01:14:31.065
She checked all the right
boxes!

01:14:32.535 --> 01:14:33.768
Arizona.

01:14:34.003 --> 01:14:35.036
What's up?

01:14:35.038 --> 01:14:38.105
Are you a female, or what?
Come straight.

01:14:39.609 --> 01:14:40.741
Yes, I am.

01:14:42.178 --> 01:14:43.110
Okay.

01:14:43.179 --> 01:14:45.112
That disqualifies you from
the competition.

01:14:45.114 --> 01:14:47.048
Now, we'll fill that final
position

01:14:47.050 --> 01:14:48.316
with our next finalist,

01:14:48.318 --> 01:14:51.786
Destiny, who will now
show us her talent.

01:14:52.422 --> 01:14:54.322
And she looks ready.

01:14:54.924 --> 01:14:55.456
All right.

01:14:55.458 --> 01:14:57.058
It's about damned time.

01:14:57.060 --> 01:14:59.126
Who's ready for some Hot Stuff?

01:14:59.128 --> 01:15:01.829
I got all the hot stuff you
need, okay?

01:15:07.003 --> 01:15:10.872
<i>♪ Sittin' here, eatin' my
heart out waitin' ♪</i>

01:15:10.874 --> 01:15:14.108
<i>♪ I'm waitin' for some lover
to call ♪</i>

01:15:31.294 --> 01:15:34.662
<i>The winner is... Miss Delilah!</i>

01:15:35.899 --> 01:15:37.765
Whoa!
Get back here, Arizona!

01:15:37.767 --> 01:15:39.300
That should have been me up
there!

01:15:39.302 --> 01:15:40.167
You took my spot!

01:15:40.169 --> 01:15:42.169
I didn't mean to take anything
from you.

01:15:42.171 --> 01:15:43.638
This was supposed to be our
night!

01:15:43.640 --> 01:15:46.374
There are hundreds of nights
for girls like you.

01:15:47.043 --> 01:15:48.209
Hey, hey, hey!

01:15:48.211 --> 01:15:49.544
Back off!
Hey!

01:15:49.546 --> 01:15:50.878
Go on, Ariziona!
Get out of here!

01:15:50.880 --> 01:15:53.214
- Don't you touch my white girl!
- Go on, Arizona!

01:15:53.216 --> 01:15:54.715
Get out of here!
Go!

01:15:58.388 --> 01:16:00.187
Kick her ass,
sea bass.

01:16:00.189 --> 01:16:02.189
Touch her again!
Touch her again!

01:16:02.191 --> 01:16:05.192
You don't want this!
You... Where's Rose?

01:16:05.194 --> 01:16:06.427
Where's Rose at?

01:16:06.429 --> 01:16:07.762
I knew she was a
girl

01:16:07.764 --> 01:16:09.196
when she walked up in
here, girl, I told y'all.

01:16:09.198 --> 01:16:11.832
- Y'all didn't believe me.
- Nobody could ever believe you.

01:16:11.834 --> 01:16:12.567
All you do is lie.

01:16:12.569 --> 01:16:15.369
- The devil is a lie.
- That's how I got in this mess.

01:16:15.371 --> 01:16:17.505
I can't believe you
got into that mess.

01:16:17.507 --> 01:16:22.343
- Must have took a whole bucket of Crisco.
- Somebody had to do it, okay?

01:16:23.746 --> 01:16:25.746
I have to pull over.

01:16:27.083 --> 01:16:30.818
Hey, hey, you did your best.
It's okay.

01:16:30.820 --> 01:16:33.454
Yeah, you probably wouldn't
have made the plane anyway.

01:16:33.456 --> 01:16:36.223
No, it's not that.

01:16:36.225 --> 01:16:38.926
That was the weirdest
night of my life.

01:16:39.996 --> 01:16:43.097
When that song came on!

01:16:43.700 --> 01:16:47.134
"Man, I feel like a woman!"

01:16:47.136 --> 01:16:48.536
When I woke up this morning,

01:16:48.538 --> 01:16:52.340
I never thought my day would
end up here.

01:16:55.445 --> 01:16:57.745
But I'm really glad it did.

01:16:58.815 --> 01:16:59.815
Yeah.

01:16:59.849 --> 01:17:02.883
I wish you'd won the
money, though.

01:17:02.885 --> 01:17:04.085
No!

01:17:04.087 --> 01:17:04.719
No, we did!

01:17:04.721 --> 01:17:08.255
We won, we definitely won!
I forgot to tell you.

01:17:08.257 --> 01:17:10.024
We are getting you to Kentucky.

01:17:10.893 --> 01:17:11.959
What?

01:17:12.962 --> 01:17:14.128
- What?
- Yes!

01:17:27.010 --> 01:17:28.275
Yay!
You found it.

01:17:28.277 --> 01:17:30.611
- I tried calling you.
- I must have left my phone.

01:17:30.613 --> 01:17:32.980
It's okay.
Everything is set.

01:17:33.282 --> 01:17:34.882
Come on.
Watch your step.

01:17:36.819 --> 01:17:39.220
The big planes are with the
rest of the agency in New York.

01:17:39.222 --> 01:17:41.255
But, this one can get her to
Louisville nonstop.

01:17:41.257 --> 01:17:43.891
The pilot just can't get here
till 7 a.m.

01:17:43.993 --> 01:17:45.793
But, there's a diner down
the street

01:17:45.795 --> 01:17:47.962
if you guys want to
kill some time.

01:17:47.964 --> 01:17:48.763
Yeah,
that's perfect!

01:17:48.765 --> 01:17:50.431
OK, now I've got to get back
to the club

01:17:50.433 --> 01:17:52.400
because I literally left
everybody there.

01:17:52.402 --> 01:17:53.901
But, I'll be back here in the
morning.

01:17:53.903 --> 01:17:56.470
- Thank you so much.
- Of course.

01:18:04.914 --> 01:18:07.014
Best burger I ever ate.

01:18:08.918 --> 01:18:13.421
So, you think you'd really
work at a place like this?

01:18:13.623 --> 01:18:14.355
Yes.

01:18:14.424 --> 01:18:16.090
Why is that so funny?

01:18:16.092 --> 01:18:18.025
I don't know, because you'd
have to touch

01:18:18.027 --> 01:18:19.994
things like, butter.

01:18:19.996 --> 01:18:21.862
You've all told me that you've
worked in diners.

01:18:21.864 --> 01:18:24.665
I don't see why the idea of
me working in a place

01:18:24.667 --> 01:18:26.300
like this is so funny.

01:18:26.302 --> 01:18:28.703
You know they make you wear
polyester.

01:18:28.838 --> 01:18:30.871
And rubber shoes.

01:18:35.778 --> 01:18:36.610
Rubber shoes!

01:18:36.612 --> 01:18:39.647
- Shoes!
- Rubber shoes!

01:18:39.816 --> 01:18:41.449
You too, huh?

01:18:41.451 --> 01:18:43.684
I've never had a real job, and
I just,

01:18:43.686 --> 01:18:45.953
I don't know,
I think it might be fun.

01:18:46.155 --> 01:18:47.521
It really isn't.

01:18:49.092 --> 01:18:50.257
But, why a diner?

01:18:50.259 --> 01:18:52.927
Growing up, I was never allowed

01:18:52.929 --> 01:18:54.829
to eat food like this as
a kid.

01:18:54.831 --> 01:18:56.363
My mom had a sign
in the kitchen:

01:18:56.365 --> 01:18:58.466
"Nothing tastes as good as
thin feels."

01:18:58.468 --> 01:19:01.535
But, all the people on TV
and commercials and stuff,

01:19:01.537 --> 01:19:05.339
whenever they eat food like
this they always seem so...

01:19:05.908 --> 01:19:06.907
happy.

01:19:06.909 --> 01:19:08.576
I don't know, I think it might
be fun

01:19:08.578 --> 01:19:11.245
to serve people all this happy
grease.

01:19:11.914 --> 01:19:13.748
You know what else is fun?

01:19:13.750 --> 01:19:14.982
What?

01:19:15.418 --> 01:19:16.717
Eating it.

01:19:19.589 --> 01:19:21.021
Here.
For you.

01:19:21.023 --> 01:19:22.189
- Oh, no.
- Oh, no no.

01:19:22.191 --> 01:19:24.525
One little ole bite.
It's not gonna kill you.

01:19:24.527 --> 01:19:27.628
- I'm fine.
- You'll still be a negative size 2.

01:19:27.630 --> 01:19:29.330
Stop.
I'm fine.

01:19:29.332 --> 01:19:30.231
- Do it.
- Do it.

01:19:30.233 --> 01:19:32.466
- Do it, do it, do it, do it!
- Do it, do it, do it, do it!

01:19:32.468 --> 01:19:34.835
Guys!

01:19:35.238 --> 01:19:37.772
Fine, fine!
Alright, fine!

01:19:38.107 --> 01:19:39.907
I will take a bite.

01:19:45.214 --> 01:19:46.747
Here we go.

01:19:52.255 --> 01:19:54.522
- It's good.
- Just good?

01:19:56.325 --> 01:19:57.491
It's amazing!

01:19:59.028 --> 01:20:01.796
- That was easy.
- This is so good!

01:20:06.068 --> 01:20:07.268
Oh.

01:20:07.537 --> 01:20:09.804
I don't know if I can swallow
this.

01:20:09.806 --> 01:20:11.238
It's delicious!

01:20:11.808 --> 01:20:13.641
Your mother would be proud.

01:20:17.046 --> 01:20:18.546
Beautiful!

01:20:19.215 --> 01:20:22.049
I'll take this whenever you
guys are ready.

01:20:29.826 --> 01:20:31.926
- It's sixty-two dollars!
- What?

01:20:31.928 --> 01:20:36.797
Jasmine, you said these burgers
were four bucks each?

01:20:37.200 --> 01:20:38.465
What the?

01:20:38.467 --> 01:20:41.135
On the kid's menu!

01:20:41.137 --> 01:20:42.137
What?

01:20:46.342 --> 01:20:49.143
Oh, look at Miss America.

01:20:49.212 --> 01:20:50.945
Living the dream.

01:21:03.226 --> 01:21:05.125
I hope you enjoy.

01:21:05.127 --> 01:21:07.361
It is so good.

01:21:12.268 --> 01:21:13.834
Hey!
Tyhefe!

01:21:13.836 --> 01:21:18.505
That dude owe me money!
Don't you drive off Tyhefe!

01:21:19.909 --> 01:21:20.474
I done told you!

01:21:20.476 --> 01:21:22.276
I told you I'd be lookin' for
your butt!

01:21:22.278 --> 01:21:24.011
Take me to the ATM
right now!

01:21:24.013 --> 01:21:26.847
Take me to the ATM, Tyhefe.

01:21:26.849 --> 01:21:27.615
Is she gonna be alright?

01:21:27.617 --> 01:21:30.384
There's one
right across the street.

01:21:30.853 --> 01:21:33.287
Jasmine's always gonna be
alright.

01:21:45.635 --> 01:21:48.235
That's one way to get to
Kentucky.

01:21:49.005 --> 01:21:51.238
How you doing, Sammy?

01:21:51.607 --> 01:21:53.140
I'm kind of scared.

01:21:53.643 --> 01:21:55.709
Oh, baby.
You got us.

01:21:56.345 --> 01:21:58.379
I don't want to go back.

01:21:58.915 --> 01:22:00.347
He knows.

01:22:00.349 --> 01:22:03.918
No, no, if our location gets
out, New Haven will move us.

01:22:04.587 --> 01:22:05.419
Hey, Rose.

01:22:05.421 --> 01:22:08.155
How many people will fit in
that plane?

01:22:08.457 --> 01:22:10.591
I don't know?
Four or five?

01:22:11.694 --> 01:22:13.460
What if we all go?

01:22:13.462 --> 01:22:17.031
Afraid, I can't cross state
lines, right now, ladies, but...

01:22:17.033 --> 01:22:17.531
I wish I could.

01:22:17.533 --> 01:22:20.567
I have to pick up my son in
three hours.

01:22:22.872 --> 01:22:24.838
Can I come?

01:22:25.474 --> 01:22:28.108
Oh my gosh, that would be so
great.

01:22:28.110 --> 01:22:29.510
Get a fresh start?

01:22:29.512 --> 01:22:32.446
Well, what about your things?
Should we go get them?

01:22:32.448 --> 01:22:33.881
I have my ID.

01:22:39.221 --> 01:22:41.689
- You ready?
- Yeah.

01:22:49.899 --> 01:22:51.598
Are you Leslie?

01:22:53.135 --> 01:22:54.435
Thank you.

01:22:55.671 --> 01:22:57.404
I'm a mama, too.

<i>♪ Put on your face

01:23:11.954 --> 01:23:15.456
I gave you Cathy's number.
When you land, give her a call.

01:23:15.458 --> 01:23:16.890
She'll help you find your boys.

01:23:16.892 --> 01:23:19.460
Okay.
And... and Cathy is?

Miss Kentucky 2005.

01:23:56.499 --> 01:24:00.100

Hey, Mom.
What are you wearing?

01:25:11.340 --> 01:25:13.907
A... costume.

01:25:14.977 --> 01:25:15.542
You have fun?

01:25:15.544 --> 01:25:17.711
Yeah!
We built a fort on the trampoline

01:25:17.713 --> 01:25:21.014
and stayed up all night long
until like, midnight.

01:25:21.016 --> 01:25:22.616
Did you have fun, Mom?

01:25:25.754 --> 01:25:26.954
Hmm.

01:25:41.103 --> 01:25:44.304
<i>Billy Bob Thornton was
standing right next to me.</i>

01:25:44.306 --> 01:25:47.040

mound of paperwork?</i>

01:25:47.042 --> 01:25:49.042

mine.</i>

Rose.</i>

01:25:56.118 --> 01:25:58.051
<i>You're going to be sorry.</i>

01:25:59.588 --> 01:26:02.322
That man's a wizard!

01:26:02.324 --> 01:26:04.458
Yeah.
Why do you think I'm here.

01:26:04.460 --> 01:26:05.726
Oh, I understand.

01:26:05.728 --> 01:26:07.060
Thank you, bye-bye.

01:26:08.063 --> 01:26:09.563
Oh!
Mr. Raynes.

01:26:09.565 --> 01:26:13.133
I tried to reach you, but I
couldn't get past your...

01:26:13.135 --> 01:26:13.934
assistant.

01:26:13.936 --> 01:26:16.737
I'm afraid Mr. Murdock is
unable to consult

01:26:16.739 --> 01:26:20.641
with you because he's already
consulted with your...

01:26:20.943 --> 01:26:22.943
Mrs. Raynes.

01:26:24.880 --> 01:26:26.180
Rose hired Murdock?

01:26:26.182 --> 01:26:27.848
Well, not officially yet,

01:26:27.850 --> 01:26:30.184
but they did have a
consultation,

01:26:30.186 --> 01:26:32.352
which creates a conflict.

01:26:33.622 --> 01:26:34.054
Okay.

01:26:34.056 --> 01:26:36.256
Okay, they?
Who is they?

01:26:36.258 --> 01:26:37.357
Oh, dear.

01:26:37.359 --> 01:26:39.526
I'm afraid I'm not at liberty
to say.

01:26:42.631 --> 01:26:43.764
Right.

01:26:43.765 --> 01:26:44.898
<i>I understand, but Mrs. Raynes</i>

01:26:44.900 --> 01:26:45.832
<i>already came in.</i>

01:26:45.834 --> 01:26:46.567
Yeah.
Yeah.

01:26:46.569 --> 01:26:48.535
Let me guess.
For a "consultation."

01:26:48.537 --> 01:26:50.304
Well, I can tell you right now,

01:26:50.306 --> 01:26:52.406
she's not hiring your firm
either so,

01:26:52.408 --> 01:26:54.341
why don't you go ahead and
tell me

01:26:54.343 --> 01:26:56.843
who's the douche bag she came
in with?

01:26:56.845 --> 01:26:58.312
<i>No.
That was no douche bag.</i>

01:26:58.314 --> 01:27:01.114
<i>That firecracker was her life
coach.</i>

01:27:02.351 --> 01:27:05.252
I didn't think I could ever
love you again.

01:27:05.254 --> 01:27:07.221
After all we've been through.

01:27:08.524 --> 01:27:10.390
But then I realized...

01:27:10.759 --> 01:27:12.526
it was all my fault.

01:27:12.995 --> 01:27:15.896
I made you react the way you
did.

01:27:16.599 --> 01:27:18.298
When I set your car on fire,

01:27:18.300 --> 01:27:21.868
I forgot your brother
was hog tied in the trunk.

01:27:22.171 --> 01:27:23.171
Rose!

01:27:23.205 --> 01:27:25.672
Hey, realtor's here.
You ready to sign?

01:27:25.874 --> 01:27:26.607
- Yes.
- All right.

01:27:26.609 --> 01:27:27.608
I'm going go pick up the bunk
beds.

01:27:27.610 --> 01:27:29.209
Perfect.
Did you get the trundle?

01:27:29.211 --> 01:27:30.310
Rita, the one from Pasadena?

01:27:30.312 --> 01:27:31.979
She has three kids coming with
her.

01:27:31.981 --> 01:27:32.879
Yeah.
Got it.

01:27:32.881 --> 01:27:33.714
See you, Boss.

01:27:33.716 --> 01:27:35.616
- Bye, Bigs.
- See you, Bigs.

01:27:35.618 --> 01:27:36.917
Let's go,
Sawyer.

01:27:40.556 --> 01:27:42.522
Are you sure I'm right for this
part?

01:27:42.524 --> 01:27:43.790
This woman is kind of a
psychopath.

01:27:43.792 --> 01:27:45.559
What are you talking about?
I don't see it that way.

01:27:45.561 --> 01:27:49.196
She's more of a problem solver.
Just like you.

01:27:49.198 --> 01:27:50.330
Hi.
Good to see you again.

01:27:50.332 --> 01:27:52.032
I love that you're opening
this home

01:27:52.034 --> 01:27:52.766
as a women's shelter.

01:27:52.768 --> 01:27:56.370
Once we repaint,
replace the carpet...

01:27:56.372 --> 01:27:57.571
they're gonna love it.

01:27:57.573 --> 01:27:59.339
And, was there anyone else's
name

01:27:59.341 --> 01:28:01.508
you wanted added to the title?

01:28:02.344 --> 01:28:05.345
