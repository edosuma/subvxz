No, it's a firm wedge
so we can get different angles.

07:22.418 --> 07:23.878
Check it out.

07:23.962 --> 07:24.963
You get the wedge up in here,

07:25.045 --> 07:26.171

these different kind of angles.

Don't they look like

07:28.466 --> 07:30.927
Wait, why do we need this?

07:31.010 --> 07:32.344
The guy at the store said
it was their best-selling thing.

07:32.428 --> 07:33.554
Why are you making fun of it?

07:33.638 --> 07:34.513

07:34.597 --> 07:36.223
We have, like, eight of these.

07:36.307 --> 07:37.182
No, no, it's not a pillow.

07:37.266 --> 07:38.183
It's a firm wedge.

07:38.267 --> 07:39.936
Okay, stop saying "firm wedge."

07:40.019 --> 07:41.562
Fine, I'll throw it in the fucking trash.

07:41.646 --> 07:42.855
Wait, wait, calm down.

07:42.939 --> 07:44.356
What's going on?

07:44.440 --> 07:45.691
Are you trying to spice things up?

07:45.775 --> 07:47.944
Yeah, I'm trying to spice things up.

07:48.027 --> 07:52.490

crazy, amazing sex all the time.

07:52.573 --> 07:53.491
You know?

07:53.574 --> 07:56.118

and then a little bit of this

07:57.829 --> 07:59.163
and then a little bit of this,
and then we're done.

07:59.246 --> 08:00.790
Okay, first of all, ouch,

08:00.873 --> 08:02.875
and second of all, who says that going in

08:02.959 --> 08:04.961

is gonna solve anything?

08:05.044 --> 08:06.337
All right, the guy said this was

08:06.420 --> 08:09.173
their best-selling thing by far, okay?

08:09.256 --> 08:11.009

08:11.091 --> 08:12.051
Okay, well, here's an idea.

08:12.134 --> 08:14.887
How about you stop rubbing your eye
every time you shove your junk in me?

08:14.971 --> 08:16.806
-What?
-Yeah, you're always like...

08:20.309 --> 08:21.435
It's distracting.

08:21.519 --> 08:24.271
Okay, well,
sometimes my contacts get dried, okay?

08:24.355 --> 08:25.439
Well, take them out.

08:25.523 --> 08:28.108
No, because then it would be like
I'm fucking someone blurry.

08:28.192 --> 08:29.944
Okay,
why don't we just go return it

08:30.028 --> 08:31.863
and go pick something out together?

08:31.946 --> 08:33.405
No, I can't return The Liberator.

08:33.489 --> 08:36.408
Babeland has a very strict return policy

08:36.492 --> 08:37.994
for obvious reasons.

08:38.077 --> 08:39.078
It's fine.

08:39.161 --> 08:41.873
I'll just use it for lumbar support
when I'm watching TV.

08:41.956 --> 08:43.833
Wait, what?

08:46.251 --> 08:49.171
Great.
Well, now I'm liberated from back pain.

08:52.967 --> 08:54.593
Ooh, nice bumps.

08:55.469 --> 08:56.470
What?

08:56.554 --> 08:57.555
That's your butt.

08:57.638 --> 08:59.431
Bumps is what I called my butt
when I was a little boo.

08:59.515 --> 09:00.683
Oh, well, thanks.

09:00.766 --> 09:02.101
You have nice bumps, too.

09:02.184 --> 09:04.979
Thank you. I'm quite proud of my bumps.

09:05.063 --> 09:06.064
I have an idea.

09:06.146 --> 09:07.189
We should name our other body parts.

09:07.272 --> 09:08.774
Why have we never done this before?

09:08.858 --> 09:10.651
What would your penis be called?

-Charlemagne.
-Wait, Charlemagne?

09:14.072 --> 09:15.280
Yeah, he's dignified.

09:15.364 --> 09:16.365
Okay, I see that.

09:16.448 --> 09:18.450
What's her name?

09:18.534 --> 09:20.327
Beatrice.

09:20.411 --> 09:21.286
Beatrice and Charlemagne?

09:21.370 --> 09:22.621
All right, I like that.

09:22.705 --> 09:24.540
Hmm.

09:24.623 --> 09:26.584
Hey, I have an idea.

09:26.667 --> 09:28.627
How about we play a game
to keep the room clean?

09:28.711 --> 09:33.925
If you catch any of my clothes
on the floor or on the chair,

09:34.008 --> 09:36.677
I have to have, uh,

09:36.761 --> 09:40.056
an intimate conversation with Beatrice.

09:40.932 --> 09:43.142
And if I catch any of your clothes

09:43.225 --> 09:44.810

09:51.109 --> 09:52.610
Hmm, that's a fun game.

09:52.693 --> 09:54.112
I'm in.

09:54.194 --> 09:55.029
All right. Boom.

10:00.076 --> 10:01.577
Whoa!

10:01.660 --> 10:06.248
Look at this clean floor!

10:06.331 --> 10:08.459
It was a really good idea.

10:14.132 --> 10:15.049
Ah!

10:16.926 --> 10:18.427
All right, sounds good.

10:18.510 --> 10:20.054
See you then. Bye.

10:20.138 --> 10:23.099
Hey, can we go get dinner
with my friend Megan tomorrow?

10:23.182 --> 10:25.559
She's moving to Thailand for three months,
and I want to say goodbye.

10:25.643 --> 10:26.477
Sure.

10:26.560 --> 10:28.604
-What's she doing in Thailand?
-I don't know.

10:28.687 --> 10:30.106
She just wanted to live abroad
for a little while.

10:30.189 --> 10:31.107
It's pretty cool.

10:31.190 --> 10:32.608
Nice.

10:35.736 --> 10:36.737
Busted.

10:36.821 --> 10:37.947
All right, come on.

10:38.030 --> 10:39.198
That's Lupe, the housekeeper.

10:39.281 --> 10:40.616
She folded them up. That doesn't count.

10:40.699 --> 10:42.451
I don't know, man. Rules are rules.

10:42.534 --> 10:44.453
I think you got to go down on Lupe.

10:44.536 --> 10:45.579
No, that's not fair.

10:45.663 --> 10:46.747
You know what's weird is that you would

10:46.831 --> 10:49.416
theoretically rather have a clean floor
than me blow you,

10:49.500 --> 10:51.127
because if I just made a mess every day,

10:51.210 --> 10:52.795
I would have to go down on you
all the time.

10:53.462 --> 10:54.672
No, you don't understand.

10:54.755 --> 10:56.340
Having a clean apartment, whew,

10:56.423 --> 10:59.135
that's like getting a tiny blow job
anytime you see a clean area.

10:59.218 --> 11:04.598
It's like, ooh, ah, ooh, ay, ooh.

11:04.682 --> 11:06.391
Okay, well,
somebody has to pay for those clothes...

11:07.392 --> 11:08.811
and I think it's you.

11:09.854 --> 11:11.313
All right.

11:11.396 --> 11:13.191
Text Lupe I'll go down on her.

11:20.531 --> 11:21.532
Hi.

11:21.615 --> 11:22.908
Dude, what are you doing?

11:22.992 --> 11:24.535
Just making sure
everything's going all right.

11:24.618 --> 11:26.411
You can't make silly faces.

11:26.495 --> 11:28.789
Sorry, I just wanted to make sure
I was doing a good job.

11:28.873 --> 11:31.125
-You're doing great.
-Can I get a juice break?

11:31.209 --> 11:32.626
Stop.

11:32.710 --> 11:34.212
All right, back to work.

11:34.294 --> 11:35.504
Shut up!

11:35.587 --> 11:36.922
I'm going back in!

11:37.006 --> 11:38.883
Here we go!

11:38.966 --> 11:40.968
- Whoa!

11:44.388 --> 11:46.891
Okay, well, have a good trip,

11:46.974 --> 11:49.227
and just text me when you guys land, okay?

11:49.309 --> 11:50.310
All right, bye, Ma.

11:50.394 --> 11:51.812
Love you.

11:52.771 --> 11:54.356
Hey.

11:54.439 --> 11:55.607
Can I ask you something?

11:55.691 --> 11:56.984
Yeah.

11:58.360 --> 12:00.196
What do your parents know about me?

12:01.989 --> 12:02.990
Huh?

12:03.074 --> 12:05.492
I just noticed on your phone conversations
with them,

12:05.576 --> 12:07.327
you never talk about me,

12:07.411 --> 12:10.455
but I talk about you with my mom
all the time,

12:10.539 --> 12:13.918
so what do they know about me?

12:14.960 --> 12:17.337
I guess I don't talk about us much.

12:17.421 --> 12:21.967
So they know I live with you?

12:24.887 --> 12:26.305
No.

12:26.388 --> 12:29.516
But they know you have a girlfriend,
right?

12:31.727 --> 12:32.978
Not really.

12:33.062 --> 12:34.188
Not really?

12:34.272 --> 12:36.481
It's a cultural thing, okay?

12:36.565 --> 12:38.317
We just don't talk
about that kind of stuff.

12:38.400 --> 12:41.361
Dev, we've been dating for almost a year!

12:41.445 --> 12:43.739
You're such a big part of my life.

12:43.822 --> 12:45.283
My parents know everything about you.

12:45.365 --> 12:47.492
My mom DVRs TV shows,

12:47.576 --> 12:50.288
so she can fast-forward through them
to watch your commercials.

12:50.370 --> 12:51.997
How do they not know about me?

12:52.081 --> 12:53.498
Well, what do you want me to do?

12:53.582 --> 12:55.251
Do you want me to call them right now?

12:55.334 --> 12:56.294
No, it's fine.

12:56.376 --> 12:58.420
If it's awkward,
I don't want to make you do anything

12:58.503 --> 13:00.214
that you don't want to do.

13:00.298 --> 13:02.549
But it just makes me feel like
you're ashamed of me

13:02.633 --> 13:04.093
or something.

13:04.176 --> 13:05.677
Look, it's different, okay?

13:05.761 --> 13:08.264
If you're a white person
and you're dating somebody,

13:08.347 --> 13:10.474
you just call your parents and tell them,
"Hey, I'm dating this person,"

13:10.557 --> 13:11.475
and they're like, "Oh, great.

13:11.558 --> 13:12.517
Let me invite him over

13:12.601 --> 13:15.187
and feed him, like,
chicken and dumplings."

13:15.271 --> 13:17.356
Okay.

13:17.439 --> 13:20.567
Hey, come on.

13:20.651 --> 13:22.486
What?

13:22.569 --> 13:25.114
That's like the kind of tone
people use when they've decided

13:25.197 --> 13:26.615
they're gonna murder the other person.

13:26.698 --> 13:27.908
That's not nice.

13:27.992 --> 13:30.035
That's like when someone's like,

13:30.119 --> 13:31.495
"Okay, no more arguing.

13:31.578 --> 13:33.872
I'll just chop their head off
when they're asleep."

13:33.956 --> 13:36.458
Rachel, don't chop my head off.

13:43.590 --> 13:45.509
Hey, boo, come here!

13:45.592 --> 13:48.512
Come have some of this fresh juice!

13:48.595 --> 13:50.472
Damn, that's not a lot of juice
for all that squeezing I did.

13:50.555 --> 13:52.308
-Hey.
-Come here. Look at this.

13:52.391 --> 13:53.934
Fresh grapefruit juice.

13:54.018 --> 13:56.561
Oh, I'm glad you like your juicer.

13:56.645 --> 13:59.148
You think you're ever gonna use
that pasta maker I got you?

13:59.231 --> 14:00.149
I want to use the pasta maker,

14:00.232 --> 14:02.151
but making fresh pasta
is a little intimidating.

14:02.234 --> 14:03.902
I might just be better at eating pasta.

14:05.946 --> 14:10.117
So I had an interesting meeting
at work yesterday.

14:10.201 --> 14:11.994
There might be a big position opening up.

14:12.077 --> 14:13.120
Nice.

14:13.204 --> 14:15.831
Yeah, and if I got it,

14:15.914 --> 14:17.582
I would be the head of the big team

14:17.666 --> 14:20.127
running Reply All and some other bands.

14:20.211 --> 14:22.421
The only thing is,
is I would have to go to Chicago

14:22.504 --> 14:24.840
for, like, six months.

14:24.923 --> 14:26.425
Six months?

14:26.508 --> 14:28.427
Wow, that's a long time.

14:28.510 --> 14:30.346
Would you come back on weekends?

14:30.429 --> 14:33.849
Yeah, I-I can come back on some weekends.

14:33.932 --> 14:35.726
But it's a great opportunity,

14:35.809 --> 14:38.229
and I can make connections I can use
with some of the cooler bands

14:38.312 --> 14:39.855
I've always wanted to work with.

14:41.357 --> 14:42.816
Yeah, I get it.

14:44.068 --> 14:46.570
You get it,
but it doesn't seem like you support it.

14:47.696 --> 14:49.489
I support it.

14:49.573 --> 14:51.742
That doesn't sound very convincing.

14:51.825 --> 14:53.369
I support it!

14:53.452 --> 14:55.871
You don't have to be an asshole about it.

14:55.954 --> 14:57.039
Hey, I'm not being an asshole.

14:57.122 --> 14:58.957
It's just, six months is a long time

14:59.041 --> 15:00.834
to just come back on some weekends.

15:00.918 --> 15:02.586
I mean, what,
now we're one of these couples

15:02.669 --> 15:04.629
that just FaceTimes each other
all the time?

15:04.713 --> 15:06.340
Look, I haven't actually taken
the position yet.

15:06.424 --> 15:08.092
They just asked
if I could fly in to interview.

15:08.175 --> 15:09.134
Can I just do that?

15:09.218 --> 15:11.303
Yeah, do whatever you want.

15:11.387 --> 15:12.971
What?

15:13.055 --> 15:14.390
It's just, I feel like you always say,

15:14.473 --> 15:16.392
"Like, oh, well, I do this,
and then I get to work

15:16.475 --> 15:17.809
with the bands
I'm really passionate about,"

15:17.893 --> 15:19.728
and it doesn't work that way, you know?

15:19.811 --> 15:23.274
And now you're talking about moving
all the way to Chicago

15:23.357 --> 15:24.816
for six months to work with these bands

15:24.900 --> 15:26.402
that I know you don't really care about.

15:26.485 --> 15:27.945
But sometimes you have to pay your dues

15:28.028 --> 15:29.947
to do the things that you want to do.

15:30.030 --> 15:31.365
You do commercials.

15:31.449 --> 15:33.325
How artistically fulfilling is that?

15:33.409 --> 15:35.369
Oh, now you're shitting on me
because I do commercials?

15:35.453 --> 15:38.914
Uh, I do commercials for, like, three days

15:38.997 --> 15:40.207
on a shoot in New York.

15:40.291 --> 15:42.542
I don't move to Chicago for six months

15:42.626 --> 15:44.420
to shoot a fucking
Fruit by the Foot commercial.

15:44.503 --> 15:47.005
If I did that, I would question
my time management skills.

15:47.089 --> 15:49.300
Wait, so you think
that I'm mismanaging my time?

15:49.383 --> 15:50.301
No, I'm just saying,

15:50.384 --> 15:52.677
are you sure you want to move
all the way to Chicago?

15:52.761 --> 15:55.306
No, I'm not sure I want to move
all the way to Chicago!

15:55.389 --> 15:56.223
Why are you yelling?

15:56.307 --> 15:58.267
Because you're right,

15:58.350 --> 16:00.602
but you're being really insensitive
about it.

16:00.685 --> 16:03.688
- God. Well--

16:03.772 --> 16:04.898
Okay, maybe I shouldn't be doing
any of this,

16:04.982 --> 16:05.899
but what am I supposed to do?

16:05.983 --> 16:07.985
I'm 30 years old. I can't just start over.

16:08.068 --> 16:09.528
I've been doing this for too long.

16:10.195 --> 16:12.156
All I'm saying is to just sit for a beat

16:12.239 --> 16:14.199
and make sure
this is something you want to do.

16:14.283 --> 16:15.909
What, I'm just gonna sit for a beat?

16:15.993 --> 16:17.536
What, am I gonna be 50?

16:17.619 --> 16:20.122
Or if I just sit around, hanging around,
doing the same shit,

16:20.205 --> 16:22.416
working with the same bands
that nobody likes?

16:22.500 --> 16:25.043
And I hate their music, and I hate my job,

16:25.127 --> 16:26.420
and, what, and I fucking hate my life?

16:26.504 --> 16:27.421
No, hey, come here.

16:27.505 --> 16:28.422
I'm not saying any of that.

16:28.506 --> 16:30.174
Jeez, come on. Hey.

16:31.383 --> 16:32.426
Come on.

16:32.510 --> 16:34.386
You want me to call Princeton Jay
from Reply All

16:34.470 --> 16:35.929
and have him sing a song
to make you feel better?

16:36.013 --> 16:37.556
Don't be fucking silly.

16:37.639 --> 16:39.558
This is serious.

16:40.559 --> 16:41.726
All right, I'm sorry.

16:43.603 --> 16:46.940
I'm just gonna do the interview
and see what they say.

16:47.941 --> 16:50.027
I have to go to work

16:50.110 --> 16:52.112
and work on some more dumb shit

16:52.196 --> 16:54.990
that I don't care about, apparently.

16:55.073 --> 16:56.575
Hey.

16:56.658 --> 16:57.826
Rachel.

♪ ♪

18:07.396 --> 18:14.403
♪ ♪

19:00.115 --> 19:01.908
I did it!

19:04.578 --> 19:05.579
Hello?

19:05.663 --> 19:06.538
Hey!

19:06.622 --> 19:07.872
How was Chicago?

19:07.956 --> 19:08.915
It was good.

19:08.999 --> 19:10.375
It smells really good in here.

19:10.459 --> 19:11.418
Yes, close your eyes.

19:11.502 --> 19:12.919
Sit on the couch.

19:23.138 --> 19:25.890
All right, open them.

19:25.974 --> 19:26.891
Surprise!

19:26.975 --> 19:28.059
I made us spaghetti carbonara.

19:28.143 --> 19:29.853
I used the pasta maker.

19:29.936 --> 19:31.480
I even made a veg version for you.

19:31.563 --> 19:32.772
You made this?

19:32.856 --> 19:34.899
Yeah. Take a bite.

19:37.653 --> 19:39.738
Mmm, this is so good.

19:39.821 --> 19:42.700
Yeah, I did good, right?

19:42.782 --> 19:44.368
Um, I really missed you.

19:44.451 --> 19:46.870
I missed you, too.

19:46.953 --> 19:48.372
The place is so clean.

19:48.455 --> 19:51.375
Yeah, because you've been gone.

19:51.458 --> 19:52.834
I missed your mess.

19:52.917 --> 19:54.545
I can make a mess.

19:57.964 --> 20:00.175
Yeah, there we go.

20:00.258 --> 20:01.593
Yes.

20:01.677 --> 20:02.844
Yes!

20:04.388 --> 20:06.640
Um, how did the interview go?

20:06.724 --> 20:09.851
The interview went really, really well,

20:09.934 --> 20:12.521
but I decided not to take the position,

20:12.604 --> 20:13.689
which actually worked out for the best,

20:13.772 --> 20:17.150
because I talked to them how I was unhappy
working with all the crappy bands,

20:17.234 --> 20:18.402
and they totally got it,

20:18.485 --> 20:19.528
and now they're gonna make
more of an effort

20:19.611 --> 20:21.321
to position me with artists
I'm really into.

20:21.405 --> 20:22.864
-That's great.
-Yeah.

20:22.947 --> 20:24.449
Yeah.

20:24.533 --> 20:26.284
Yeah, six months
would have been pretty intense.

20:26.368 --> 20:30.872
I-- I guess I was a little scared. Um...

20:30.955 --> 20:32.457
I know we fight about, like, silly stuff,

20:32.541 --> 20:36.294
and I have been known to make silly faces

20:36.378 --> 20:37.462
when I'm going down on you.

20:37.546 --> 20:39.673
But, um,

20:39.757 --> 20:42.760
I really like this.

20:42.842 --> 20:45.429
I like this, too.

20:45.512 --> 20:46.597
And I like this.

20:49.099 --> 20:51.268
-Mmm, so good.
-Hey, hey, take it easy.

20:51.351 --> 20:52.770
-So good.
-You're going crazy.

20:52.852 --> 20:54.896
Stop. No.

20:58.191 --> 20:59.025
-Eh?
-That looks nice.

20:59.109 --> 21:00.611
-Yeah, this is better.
-Yeah.

21:01.986 --> 21:03.196
Ooh, that's them.

21:04.114 --> 21:05.031
-Hello.
-Hey.

21:05.115 --> 21:07.534
-How are you?
-Good, good. Come on in.

21:07.618 --> 21:08.868
How are you?

21:08.952 --> 21:10.829
What's up, man?

21:12.581 --> 21:14.708
It's so dirty in the stairway.

21:14.792 --> 21:16.918
You need to move to a nicer building.

21:17.001 --> 21:18.336
It's old.

21:18.420 --> 21:20.964
Maybe you should find a cleaner place.

21:21.047 --> 21:21.965
Yeah.

21:22.048 --> 21:24.509
You know, because most of the buildings
in New York are nice and cheap,

21:24.593 --> 21:25.636
so I'll just pop into one of those

21:25.719 --> 21:27.471
instead of this one
that I chose for no reason.

21:27.554 --> 21:28.764
I still don't believe

21:28.847 --> 21:31.015
that you've been living with this girl
for a whole year

21:31.099 --> 21:32.392
and didn't tell us.

21:32.476 --> 21:34.561
Yeah, but I don't know, it's--

21:34.645 --> 21:36.438
I thought it might be weird
because you guys

21:36.521 --> 21:38.440
are from a different culture
and everything.

21:38.523 --> 21:39.733
Different culture?

21:39.817 --> 21:44.404
Po-da!
We've been living here for 40 years.

21:44.488 --> 21:46.323
It is like that movie.

21:46.406 --> 21:47.365
What's the one?

21:47.449 --> 21:50.744
The Ben Stiller movie
where he meets the parents?

21:50.828 --> 21:51.953
It's called Meet the Parents.

21:52.036 --> 21:53.538
Meet the Parents!

21:53.622 --> 21:54.706
Stop it, Ramesh.

21:54.790 --> 21:56.583
I like that movie.

21:56.667 --> 21:57.793
It's funny.

22:01.129 --> 22:02.714
Just tea?

22:02.798 --> 22:04.299
Any Indian sweets?

22:04.382 --> 22:05.592
Some laddus?

22:05.676 --> 22:07.010
No, we don't have any Indian sweets.

22:07.093 --> 22:08.386
We have some cheeses.

22:08.470 --> 22:09.304
Cheese?

22:09.387 --> 22:10.639
I don't like cheese.

22:10.722 --> 22:11.849
Any popadam?

22:11.931 --> 22:14.017
Popadam is Indian chips.

22:15.519 --> 22:17.479
Rachel, we brought you a small gift.

22:17.562 --> 22:18.772
Thank you so much.

22:18.856 --> 22:20.398
You didn't have to do that.

22:20.482 --> 22:22.233
I hope you like it.

22:22.317 --> 22:24.027
Wow, I love it.

22:24.110 --> 22:25.904
Oh, my God, thank you.

22:25.987 --> 22:27.614
It's so nice.

22:27.698 --> 22:30.116
And it's real nice meeting you.

22:30.200 --> 22:31.284
It's nice meeting you.

22:31.368 --> 22:32.243
Wonderful.

22:32.327 --> 22:35.789
Let me take a picture of this moment.

22:35.873 --> 22:37.040
Okay, guys.

22:37.123 --> 22:39.250
Sit together.

22:39.334 --> 22:41.545
Hey, tuck your tummy, man.

22:41.628 --> 22:43.254
What?

22:43.338 --> 22:44.464
Okay.

22:44.548 --> 22:46.049
Smile.

22:46.132 --> 22:47.091
One, two, three.

22:51.596 --> 22:52.639
All right, night-night.

22:52.723 --> 22:54.307
Night.

23:02.900 --> 23:03.859
I can't sleep, boo.

23:03.942 --> 23:05.109
Aw.

23:05.193 --> 23:06.152
Can you tell me a story?

23:06.236 --> 23:07.445
Mm...

23:09.322 --> 23:10.866
Once upon a time,

23:10.949 --> 23:15.036
there was a little boo named Dev,

23:15.119 --> 23:17.664
and he couldn't sleep,

23:17.748 --> 23:22.502
and he kept
the lovely Princess Rachel awake,

23:22.586 --> 23:26.381
and she went crazy,
and she beat his bumps.

23:26.464 --> 23:27.799
Hey.

23:27.883 --> 23:29.593
That story doesn't have a good ending.

23:29.676 --> 23:30.510
It's too sad.

23:30.594 --> 23:31.636
You tell me a story.

23:31.720 --> 23:33.221
Okay.

23:33.304 --> 23:34.973
Um...

23:35.056 --> 23:37.225
once upon a time,
there was this little boo named Dev,

23:37.308 --> 23:38.560
and one day,

23:38.643 --> 23:41.605
he met this beautiful princess
named Rachel,

23:41.688 --> 23:44.315
and she had the nicest bumps ever,

23:44.399 --> 23:46.902
and she was really cool and funny.

23:46.985 --> 23:48.737
And she was standing at this jukebox,

23:48.820 --> 23:49.863
and little Dev went over and said,

23:49.947 --> 23:51.448
"Hey, were you playing the Buzzcocks?"

23:51.531 --> 23:53.116
And she was like, "Oh, yeah, that was me,"

23:53.199 --> 23:54.993
and he was like,
"Oh, I love the Buzzcocks."

23:55.076 --> 23:57.662
And they started talking and dancing,

23:57.746 --> 24:00.290
and eventually, they went home together,

24:00.373 --> 24:02.918
and Charlemagne met Beatrice.

24:03.001 --> 24:05.712
But that night,
Charlemagne was so powerful,

24:05.796 --> 24:07.380
he broke through his protective shield,

24:07.464 --> 24:10.968
and they had to go get the magic potion

24:11.050 --> 24:13.386
called a Plan B pill,
and it was kind of weird.

24:13.470 --> 24:16.055
And they thought they were never
gonna see each other ever again.

24:16.139 --> 24:18.391
But then they ran into each other
at a concert,

24:18.475 --> 24:20.894
and they were drinking
and dancing and having fun,

24:20.978 --> 24:22.980
and then Dev was like,
"Ooh, I'm gonna kiss her."

24:23.062 --> 24:27.525
But Princess Rachel
was dating some evil prince

24:27.609 --> 24:29.903
that lived in some kingdom called Seattle,
so she couldn't do it.

24:31.237 --> 24:32.238
But then one day,

24:32.322 --> 24:34.032
they took a trip to Nashville together,

24:34.115 --> 24:36.075
and they had so much fun.

24:36.159 --> 24:38.202
It was the greatest trip ever.

24:38.286 --> 24:41.456
And eventually,
they moved into the same castle together.

24:41.539 --> 24:44.250
And every now and then,
they fought about silly stuff,

24:44.334 --> 24:46.294
and sometimes they fought
about more serious stuff.

24:46.377 --> 24:48.254
But in the end, they figured it out

24:48.338 --> 24:50.590
because they love each other very much

24:50.674 --> 24:53.510
and they really love the kingdom
they built together.

24:53.593 --> 24:54.928
The end.

24:55.804 --> 24:57.889
Did they live happily ever after?

24:57.973 --> 25:00.475
I don't know about ever after,
but they're pretty happy now.
