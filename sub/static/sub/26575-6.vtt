LADY JUSTICE SPENCER:
On the morning of November 29th

00:08.200 --> 00:10.999
you boarded a west-bound DLR train

00:11.080 --> 00:13.993
at 10:09am, is that correct?

00:14.320 --> 00:17.496
EMILY: If that's what the cameras say,
I wasn't really keeping track of the time.

00:17.520 --> 00:18.816
LADY JUSTICE:
And you disembarked the train

00:18.840 --> 00:21.116
at West India Quay station,
is that correct?

00:21.520 --> 00:22.520
That's right.

00:24.040 --> 00:25.200
LADY JUSTICE: You then walked

00:25.280 --> 00:27.715
to the Eldon street branch
of Café 66.

00:27.800 --> 00:29.393
- Is that correct?
- EMILY: Yes.

00:29.800 --> 00:31.314
EMILY: I was meeting a friend.

00:32.600 --> 00:35.593
LADY JUSTICE: For what reason
were you meeting your friend that morning?

00:38.400 --> 00:39.400
Thanks.

00:39.520 --> 00:41.955
EMILY: Uh, nothing particular...

00:43.200 --> 00:44.475
Just catching up.

00:45.120 --> 00:46.120
HOLLY: Emily.

00:49.280 --> 00:51.795
You knew Holly Morton
through your husband's work

00:51.920 --> 00:52.797
is that correct?

00:52.920 --> 00:54.115
EMILY: That's correct.

00:54.680 --> 00:55.875
LADY JUSTICE: Was it normal

00:56.080 --> 00:58.197
for you to socialise
with your husband's colleagues?

01:01.200 --> 01:02.680
One moment, Mrs Waters.

BARRISTER WHISPERS: BSS has reminded me
that this line of questioning

01:16.240 --> 01:17.993
was protected in the PII.

01:18.960 --> 01:20.920
LADY JUSTICE WHISPERS:
Protected at my discretion.

01:21.280 --> 01:22.634
I'm just the messenger.

01:23.800 --> 01:25.200
OK, thank you.

01:31.400 --> 01:32.400
Mrs Waters

01:32.720 --> 01:35.110
in the interest of national security

01:35.160 --> 01:38.198
we will not be pursuing
this line of enquiry any further.

01:47.120 --> 01:48.713
PHONE'S BEEP. INDISTINCT CHATTER

01:50.680 --> 01:52.080
ROSE: Very dashing, Geoffrey.

01:52.560 --> 01:54.320
How was your speech?
I haven't made it yet.

01:54.400 --> 01:57.016
My wife's waiting in the car,
I want to know what she's waiting for.

01:57.040 --> 01:58.360
Sal Brahimi's solicitors

01:58.640 --> 02:00.154
refuse to start without you.

02:02.280 --> 02:03.280
Howard Cook.

02:07.160 --> 02:08.919
My client would like to turn
Queen's evidence

02:09.120 --> 02:10.554
in exchange for a reduced sentence.

02:10.880 --> 02:11.916
GEOFFREY: Oh, would he?

02:12.200 --> 02:14.351
He'd be better off pleading insanity.

02:15.160 --> 02:18.836
What my client has to offer,
is in the interest of national security.

02:20.000 --> 02:21.440
HOWARD COOK:
If ignored it could have

02:21.720 --> 02:24.110
grave consequences for untold lives

02:24.160 --> 02:26.038
and my client
would be left with no choice

02:26.360 --> 02:27.635
but to inform the press

02:28.040 --> 02:29.952
the Deputy Assistant Commissioner
himself

02:30.680 --> 02:31.830
chose not to listen.

02:34.920 --> 02:37.480
This goes in the shredder
if his intel craps out.

02:41.240 --> 02:42.356
<i>Yeah, that's him.</i>

02:43.840 --> 02:46.912
<i>Let the record show
my client has identified Yousef Hassan.</i>

02:47.120 --> 02:50.431
HOWARD COOK:
Yousef Hassan was a CTSU informant, yes?

02:52.640 --> 02:54.438
SAL:
<i>One day, he just stayed behind</i>

02:54.600 --> 02:57.638
<i>after working out and then he starts
asking me bare questions about Ahmed.</i>

02:58.280 --> 03:00.080
<i>He starts asking me enough questions
about him</i>

03:00.160 --> 03:01.958
<i>about Rotterdam, all of that</i>

03:02.040 --> 03:04.475
<i>and uh... see what it was,
was Yousef...</i>

03:04.920 --> 03:06.536
<i>He had seen me with him
a few months before</i>

03:06.560 --> 03:08.176
and then now he's asking me
all these questions.

03:08.200 --> 03:09.656
You know, I thought is was a bit strange.

03:09.680 --> 03:11.080
INTERVIEWER:
What kind of questions?

03:12.520 --> 03:13.636
Was that your mate?

03:13.760 --> 03:16.355
How did you know him?
Were you involved in all that kinda stuff?

03:16.440 --> 03:18.477
Basically questions that
you just don't ask.

03:18.560 --> 03:20.119
Questions that got him killed.

03:20.400 --> 03:21.959
HOLLY: Where is he now?

03:22.040 --> 03:24.509
WORRALL: The asset's on the move,
moving East towards Newham.

03:25.640 --> 03:27.480
GABE: Could be on the way
to Chessington Close.

03:28.520 --> 03:29.520
WORRALL: We'll see.

03:33.200 --> 03:34.236
INTERVIEWER: <i>Mr Brahimi.</i>

03:34.480 --> 03:37.234
<i>You need to explain very clearly</i>

03:37.960 --> 03:39.997
<i>who killed Yousef Hassan.</i>

03:40.880 --> 03:41.880
SAL LAUGHS

03:42.120 --> 03:43.120
Ahmed.

03:43.240 --> 03:44.240
This guy here.

03:44.520 --> 03:45.520
Ahmed, innit?

03:45.680 --> 03:47.399
I mean, well,
I gave him the heads up

03:47.440 --> 03:48.456
and then he's the one who did it.

03:48.480 --> 03:49.834
He's the one who got it done.

03:51.080 --> 03:53.231
INTERVIEWER:
<i>Are you aware intelligence reports state</i>

03:54.000 --> 03:55.275
<i>that Ahmed El Adoua</i>

03:55.680 --> 03:58.149
<i>was killed by a drone strike in Syria</i>

03:58.840 --> 04:00.991
<i>prior to Yousef Hassan's murder?</i>

04:01.600 --> 04:03.990
SAL: <i>Look, I don't know
what the television's talking about</i>

04:04.080 --> 04:06.390
<i>cos, uh, he... I was with him.
He was in London.</i>

04:06.600 --> 04:08.114
<i>We were together that same morning.</i>

04:08.560 --> 04:10.480
<i>Hey, I don't know who they killed,
it wasn't him.</i>

04:14.280 --> 04:15.680
Look, this is him.

04:16.399 --> 04:18.471
He's the one who did it.
He, um...

04:19.720 --> 04:21.757
He did it. He's still alive, as well.

04:22.240 --> 04:23.680
INTERVIEWER:
<i>Do you know where he is?</i>

04:23.960 --> 04:26.350
SAL:
<i>Like I said, 17 Chessington Close.</i>

04:27.360 --> 04:28.360
Shit.

04:29.080 --> 04:31.390
INTERVIEWER: <i>Let the record
show my client has identified.</i>

04:32.760 --> 04:34.080

04:46.440 --> 04:47.440
<i>Salaam</i>, brother.

04:49.160 --> 04:50.160
Yeah, <i>salaam.</i>

04:51.280 --> 04:53.397
EL ADOUA: They're calling you Raza, right?
- Yeah.

04:54.240 --> 04:55.240
What they call you?

04:56.400 --> 04:58.960
Saleem is telling me
you need a place to stay, right?

04:59.520 --> 05:01.477
Uh, yeah, if it's no bother.

05:02.360 --> 05:03.589
You're homeless or no?

05:04.480 --> 05:06.199
Yeah... my parents turfed me out.

05:06.560 --> 05:08.216
AL ADOUA:
Well maybe we have a bed for you.

05:08.240 --> 05:10.240
Why are you standing by the door?
Come on, come in.

05:13.080 --> 05:14.673
HE SPEAKS IN FRENCH:
Give him your seat.

05:15.720 --> 05:16.756
You, um...

05:17.040 --> 05:18.076
You like to play?

05:18.640 --> 05:19.869
RAZA: Check these graphics.

05:20.640 --> 05:22.518
That was definitely made
before I was born.

05:22.840 --> 05:25.071
Yeah, well, Zakir spilled his breakfast

05:25.480 --> 05:26.800
all over the old one

05:26.920 --> 05:28.593
so that's basically what we have now.

05:29.080 --> 05:30.309
That wasn't me, Ahmed.

05:30.400 --> 05:31.400
That was Farook.

05:32.760 --> 05:33.760
RAZA: Ahmed, yeah?

05:34.960 --> 05:36.120
Do I know you from somewhere?

05:36.320 --> 05:37.320
No.

05:38.240 --> 05:39.640
No you don't, no one does.

05:42.640 --> 05:45.235
Only as international,
come on, pick your side.

05:49.120 --> 05:51.999
EL ADOUA: Ah, interesting,
why are you picking England?

05:53.960 --> 05:55.110
I dunno, cos I'm English.

05:55.480 --> 05:56.630
And do I...

05:57.000 --> 05:58.878
I don't know, do I look Brazilian to you.

05:59.880 --> 06:00.880
No.

06:01.680 --> 06:03.592
I just pick them cos they're the best.

06:04.600 --> 06:05.600
England is shit.

06:06.760 --> 06:07.880
Why are you picking England?

06:10.520 --> 06:11.520
I was born here.

06:11.760 --> 06:12.760
I just picked 'em.

06:13.480 --> 06:14.480
EL ADOUA: Oh.

06:15.320 --> 06:16.720
Well, think about that.

06:17.680 --> 06:20.354
They broke into your head so much

06:21.200 --> 06:24.159
that even in the ancient virtual reality
of this game

06:24.240 --> 06:25.594
you still think you're English.

06:27.840 --> 06:30.036
Now what can I think about that, huh?

06:30.600 --> 06:33.069
Like, even the tiny little pixel fans

06:33.200 --> 06:34.600
in this fake stadium

06:34.680 --> 06:35.875
with their fake flags

06:36.160 --> 06:37.799
drinking their fake beers

06:38.040 --> 06:39.759
getting into fake fights.

06:40.000 --> 06:41.992
You know you're not English.

06:43.160 --> 06:46.312
You are not English, Raza, you are Muslim.

06:47.800 --> 06:49.712
Now, tell me...

06:51.240 --> 06:52.240
why you picking England?

06:53.160 --> 06:54.196
I dunno, bruv...

06:55.400 --> 06:57.198
If it was cricket, I'd
pick Pakistan, innit.

06:57.720 --> 06:59.393

06:59.880 --> 07:03.157

07:03.320 --> 07:04.390

07:04.480 --> 07:05.480
Off-side.

07:05.880 --> 07:07.633
It's disallowed, no goal.

07:09.040 --> 07:10.269
EL ADOUA: Yeah, shit.

07:12.520 --> 07:13.920
Alright, take your kick.

07:14.400 --> 07:16.119
Wait, wait, wait.

07:18.200 --> 07:20.237
Did Sal say anything to you
about getting arrested?

07:20.880 --> 07:22.320
EL ADOUA:
What are you talking about?

07:23.000 --> 07:24.160
FAROOK: My friend just, uh...

07:24.920 --> 07:26.070
sent me this picture.

07:27.720 --> 07:29.837
Apparently the police
got the gym on lockdown.

07:35.800 --> 07:37.359
We gonna finish up?

07:38.480 --> 07:39.596
Get back to the game?

07:40.920 --> 07:41.920
Ah, no...

07:43.960 --> 07:44.996
No, no, no.

07:48.120 --> 07:49.270
That game's not real.

07:57.280 --> 07:59.376
GABE: Alright gentlemen,
one last time before you head in.

07:59.400 --> 08:00.914
This is my asset.

08:01.680 --> 08:03.360
I just want you to get a good look at him.

08:03.760 --> 08:05.080
Before you head in there.

08:05.440 --> 08:06.510
That's my asset.

08:08.200 --> 08:10.556
Do not, I repeat, <i>do not</i> shoot him.

08:10.720 --> 08:12.040
Roger that, we'll do our best.

08:12.280 --> 08:15.079
Remember if you see a vest
or a detonator, don't run

08:15.120 --> 08:16.736
drop flat and breathe through your mouth.

El Adoua remains dead in Syria

08:39.760 --> 08:40.796

08:41.200 --> 08:42.600
What's the unofficial story?

08:42.919 --> 08:44.035
Bad source on the ground.

08:44.280 --> 08:46.078
Yeah, my source is paying for it.

08:46.280 --> 08:48.795

I'd have never let him go in.

GABE SIGHS

10:46.760 --> 10:47.760
Alright?

10:50.160 --> 10:51.816
Now, I'll catch up with you
at the hospital.

10:51.840 --> 10:53.433
No, I just want to go home.

10:53.520 --> 10:54.874
Hey, we'll get you there.

10:55.000 --> 10:56.992
I just need to know
that you're alright first.

10:57.080 --> 10:58.639
RAZA: I'm fine.

10:59.040 --> 11:01.520
RAZA: Alright, alright...
- WOMAN: Some geezer's looking at me.

11:02.040 --> 11:03.156
WOMAN: What you looking at?

11:04.440 --> 11:06.040
I thought we'd cleared the street, guys?

11:07.880 --> 11:09.176
WOMAN:
Great now, two geezers are coming over.

11:09.200 --> 11:10.520
Police, show us your phone.

11:11.480 --> 11:12.630
Only, it's a free country.

11:12.840 --> 11:14.936
Not right now it's not, you're trespassing
on a crime scene.

11:14.960 --> 11:15.960
Hand me your phone, miss.

11:20.320 --> 11:21.320
Where's the video?

11:23.000 --> 11:25.080
I don't know where it goes,
it's live-streamed innit?

11:31.080 --> 11:32.480
NURSE: Any nausea?

11:33.040 --> 11:34.040
Or dizziness?

11:34.120 --> 11:36.200
Not until you started blasting
that torch in my face.

11:36.680 --> 11:37.680
Nausea...

11:37.800 --> 11:39.120
- Dizziness?
- I said "no".

11:39.560 --> 11:40.800
How long do I have to sit here?

11:40.880 --> 11:42.109
GABE: How's the patient doing?

11:42.520 --> 11:45.638
Dangerously low on charm,
but otherwise, he'll survive.

11:46.480 --> 11:48.312
INDISTINCT HOSPITAL ANNOUNCEMENT

11:48.840 --> 11:51.400
DOOR CLOSES.
Hey, don't go pissing the nurses off

11:51.800 --> 11:53.320
they decide where they put the needle!

11:53.400 --> 11:55.790
Why is there a guy with a gun
outside my room?

11:56.360 --> 11:58.160
We don't know if we've
got the full cell yet.

11:58.640 --> 11:59.800
Like someone's coming for me?

11:59.920 --> 12:01.673
Hey, it's just a precaution.

12:03.680 --> 12:06.080
Anyway, I thought you could do
with a free bed for the night.

12:07.640 --> 12:09.074
I'm glad someone finds this funny.

12:10.280 --> 12:11.350
What happened in there?

12:16.000 --> 12:17.514
Did you know Yousef was a snitch?

12:19.080 --> 12:20.116
El Adoua tell you that?

12:21.560 --> 12:22.835
Hold up, was he your snitch?

12:24.240 --> 12:25.754
I can't talk about Yousef

12:26.680 --> 12:28.592
same way that I can't talk
to anybody about you.

12:30.000 --> 12:31.000
Yeah.

12:33.120 --> 12:34.280
What am I supposed to do now?

12:34.560 --> 12:36.200
What?
You don't wanna keep working for me?

12:37.200 --> 12:38.350
You're joking, right?

12:39.120 --> 12:41.157
Hole up here tonight,
tomorrow's tomorrow.

12:41.800 --> 12:42.836
You can do what you want.

12:44.680 --> 12:45.796
What if I can't go back?

12:46.280 --> 12:47.280
You know, to like...

12:47.440 --> 12:48.920
- normal?
- Yeah...

12:50.080 --> 12:51.230
Yeah, that's a tough one.

12:53.440 --> 12:55.520
There was this trick I learnt
when I was under cover.

12:56.640 --> 12:57.756
You were under cover?

12:58.640 --> 13:00.518
Yeah, I can't talk about it.

13:01.960 --> 13:04.111
Helpful.
Well, it might be if you let me finish.

13:05.280 --> 13:07.272
Whenever I was trying to switch

13:07.400 --> 13:08.675
between the two worlds

13:09.200 --> 13:10.600
my handler would come and find me.

13:11.520 --> 13:13.240
She was the only person that I could trust.

13:14.360 --> 13:16.511
She'd park up in this layby
in the middle of nowhere

13:18.000 --> 13:20.117
and I'd get in the boot of her Volvo.

13:20.880 --> 13:22.155
She'd drive me round for hours.

13:24.280 --> 13:25.430
Why would she do that?

13:26.280 --> 13:28.158
It was the only safe place
that I could think.

13:29.120 --> 13:30.120
About what?

13:30.480 --> 13:33.314
Just uh... I'd think back on my life

13:33.720 --> 13:35.951
and try to find that moment

13:36.880 --> 13:39.031
you know, that memory
when everything was just

13:39.680 --> 13:41.034
locked there in amber.

13:42.040 --> 13:45.000
Back when I thought that there was
nothing in the world that could hurt me.

13:46.920 --> 13:48.832
I'd lie there curled up in the dark.

13:49.680 --> 13:51.080
Just tried to get back to that.

13:55.040 --> 13:56.040
Did it work?

13:57.080 --> 13:59.595
Straightened me out
most of the time, yeah... yeah.

14:04.760 --> 14:05.910
What was the memory?

14:07.240 --> 14:08.240
That's for me.

14:09.200 --> 14:10.200
Let's think about you.

14:12.600 --> 14:13.600
GABE: Close your eyes.

14:14.760 --> 14:15.796
Come on.

14:16.640 --> 14:18.757
You have to trust me,
close your eyes.

15:16.400 --> 15:17.400
Afraid so.

15:19.560 --> 15:20.560
But you're OK?

15:21.280 --> 15:22.280
Yeah.

15:24.480 --> 15:26.039
- Where's Lori?
- Asleep, I hope.

15:26.200 --> 15:27.316
Mum sends her regards.

15:27.440 --> 15:28.635
GABE: I bet she does.

15:31.040 --> 15:33.396
Ems, I know there's a lot
for me to explain.

15:34.560 --> 15:35.789
You got your cases packed.

15:36.040 --> 15:38.077
At least give me a chance.
Who was she?

15:41.000 --> 15:42.000
Bring Lori home.

15:42.280 --> 15:43.350
I can't stay here.

15:43.520 --> 15:44.520
I'll sleep on the couch

15:44.600 --> 15:46.910
if it makes it any easier.
Who was she, Gabe?

15:47.920 --> 15:48.920
Who's Sharon?

15:49.600 --> 15:51.159
I've told you all I can.

15:52.560 --> 15:54.916
She's a contact from my UC days.

15:56.720 --> 15:58.359
Did you fuck all your contacts?

16:00.440 --> 16:02.318
She walked into our house...

16:03.280 --> 16:04.350
my life.

16:06.280 --> 16:07.999
WHISPERING:
I don't feel safe here anymore.

16:10.440 --> 16:11.874
She's not coming back.

16:15.080 --> 16:16.080
I don't know.

16:17.960 --> 16:19.394
The miles aren't adding up.

16:21.120 --> 16:22.315
You should get some sleep.

16:24.440 --> 16:26.193
Queen and country are depending on it.

17:15.040 --> 17:17.635
I came by to see if
it's all caught up with you yet.

17:17.960 --> 17:19.916

17:20.760 --> 17:22.035

17:23.079 --> 17:24.560
Well, more for me then.

17:37.800 --> 17:39.120
It came with the flat.

17:40.480 --> 17:42.039
You must be Megan?

17:42.480 --> 17:43.994
You must be Gabe?

17:45.000 --> 17:47.151
Well, now we know each other
on a first name basis

17:47.240 --> 17:49.160
do you mind if I borrow
your sister for a minute?

17:49.640 --> 17:51.597
Bit late for police business,
isn't it?

17:51.720 --> 17:53.757
You can eavesdrop just fine
from your room.

18:01.400 --> 18:02.470
I didn't wake you, did I?

18:02.880 --> 18:05.280
HOLLY: You told me
to get some sleep, I was following orders.

18:05.640 --> 18:07.199
I'm glad one of us is coping.

18:08.520 --> 18:09.920
- Is something wrong?
- No.

18:11.000 --> 18:13.469
Markets are down,
the oceans are rising.

18:14.160 --> 18:16.356
Emily's taken Lori,
moved out of the house.

18:16.520 --> 18:17.520
Just another day.

18:18.440 --> 18:19.440
What happened?

18:19.480 --> 18:22.120
Someone from my UC days
turned up on the doorstep

18:22.200 --> 18:23.634
and scared the shit out of her.

18:24.640 --> 18:25.517
Did she get hurt?

18:25.600 --> 18:26.600
No.

18:27.360 --> 18:29.556
No, luckily, I got home just in time.

18:30.280 --> 18:31.280
Who was it?

18:31.720 --> 18:32.995
Sharon Collins.

18:33.320 --> 18:34.549
You heard that name before?

18:35.720 --> 18:37.518
- I don't think so.
- No?

18:37.920 --> 18:39.149
Nigel mentioned her.

18:40.200 --> 18:42.016
Thought you might have caught it
because, uh...

18:42.040 --> 18:43.200
you don't miss a beat, do ya?

18:43.280 --> 18:44.430
Yeah, maybe.

18:45.160 --> 18:47.616
I'm just trying to figure out
how a friend of Charlie's ended up

18:47.640 --> 18:49.154
on my sofa. Any ideas?

18:49.800 --> 18:51.712
What do you think? I don't know.

18:52.360 --> 18:55.194
I mean, the miles, they're just not
adding up, you know what I mean?

18:57.880 --> 18:59.473
I didn't give anyone your address.

18:59.760 --> 19:02.514
Do you think this is about
an address?

19:03.600 --> 19:05.319
Do you know who these people are?

19:06.000 --> 19:07.195
What they can do?

19:07.480 --> 19:09.915
What they could have done
to my wife and my daughter?

19:10.520 --> 19:13.035
She was in my fucking house!
Emily asked me.

19:13.120 --> 19:15.919
What did she ask you?
She asked me to find out who Charlie is.

19:16.040 --> 19:17.474
You know who Charlie is.

19:17.800 --> 19:18.995
He was my legend.

19:19.080 --> 19:20.776
He's more than that,
you're still living him

19:20.800 --> 19:21.800
you never stopped.

19:22.120 --> 19:23.270
That's the training.

19:23.800 --> 19:25.996
Right, you saw the run-in,
it's a small world

19:26.080 --> 19:29.039
I can never put it down.
Not if you're the one keeping him alive.

19:29.120 --> 19:30.520
Course I'm keeping him alive!

19:31.400 --> 19:33.995
Who do you think has kept me
breathing all these fucking years.

19:35.040 --> 19:36.235
God didn't save the Queen

19:36.320 --> 19:37.151
Charlie did!

19:37.240 --> 19:38.280
MEGAN: Holls, you alright?

19:38.480 --> 19:39.994
I don't know, Charlie, am I?

19:42.400 --> 19:43.400
HOLLY: I'm fine.

19:43.880 --> 19:45.109
This doesn't look fine.

19:45.520 --> 19:46.520
Meg, it's fine.

19:49.880 --> 19:50.916
Meg, please.

19:53.600 --> 19:55.717
When did you start going back?

19:56.040 --> 19:57.040
GABE SIGHS

19:58.440 --> 19:59.635
Do I need to call my lawyer?

20:00.440 --> 20:02.557
Do you always answer a question
with a question?

20:07.400 --> 20:09.357
Couple of years after
the trial ended.

20:10.360 --> 20:12.113
I heard an old song on the radio

20:12.240 --> 20:14.040
and I just found myself
driving back up there.

20:16.240 --> 20:17.833
Weren't people suspicious?

20:18.280 --> 20:19.280
What, of Charlie?

20:20.680 --> 20:22.273
It was like a home-coming.

20:22.880 --> 20:24.712
He was a hero to those people.

20:25.120 --> 20:26.236
The one that got away.

20:26.320 --> 20:28.039
So that's why you did it?
Validation?

20:28.800 --> 20:29.800
Oh, for...

20:30.080 --> 20:31.400
I don't know, Holly.

20:32.560 --> 20:34.711
UC work has fucked us all up.

20:35.960 --> 20:37.633
Most of the level 1's I know...

20:39.200 --> 20:40.429
they're all addicts

20:40.640 --> 20:42.313
alcoholics, divorced...

20:42.440 --> 20:43.874
But you're the only one going back.

20:53.960 --> 20:56.031
They uh... they have cameras

20:56.200 --> 20:57.350
at the Legion.

20:59.200 --> 21:00.429
What do you want to know?

21:02.200 --> 21:03.600
I read up on your cases.

21:04.200 --> 21:06.351
You lived in filth for five years.

21:07.000 --> 21:08.275
You called fascists

21:08.480 --> 21:10.392
and neo-Nazis your friends.

21:10.840 --> 21:13.594
You saw those people do
awful, awful things.

21:15.040 --> 21:16.633
I want to know why someone like you

21:16.720 --> 21:18.632
would want to keep going back
to that.

21:19.200 --> 21:20.200
Look...

21:21.000 --> 21:23.117
No one tells you
where the edge of the pool is.

21:23.600 --> 21:27.037
Right? You just wade out there
and you hope to find it.

21:28.200 --> 21:29.316
Then at some point...

21:30.280 --> 21:33.557
you find yourself in someone's
living room with a cigarette in your hand

21:34.120 --> 21:35.793
and either you blow your cover

21:36.120 --> 21:37.873
or you burn the poor bastard.

21:39.480 --> 21:41.472
At that point, I turned away

21:42.080 --> 21:43.116
but Charlie...

21:43.600 --> 21:45.319
he just kept on swimming out.

21:51.680 --> 21:53.280
You're right, that really fucked you up.

22:04.840 --> 22:06.120
What are you gonna do with that?

22:18.320 --> 22:19.993
HE SIGHS

22:23.760 --> 22:25.194
What am I gonna tell Emily?

22:27.600 --> 22:28.954
I can't lie to her.

22:29.360 --> 22:30.360
I don't want you to lie.

22:33.160 --> 22:34.879
I want you to do what I can't.

22:37.040 --> 22:38.360
Just give her the truth.

22:40.080 --> 22:41.355
Can you do that for me?

22:47.160 --> 22:48.640
Y... Yeah, OK.

22:49.280 --> 22:50.280
Alright.

22:52.960 --> 22:53.960
Thank you.

22:57.720 --> 22:58.756
Thank you, Holly.

Oh, hi. I'm such a mess.

25:23.080 --> 25:24.560
I think I've lost my bloody phone.

25:24.680 --> 25:26.876
Oh, use mine. Call it.

I think you have my phone,
well obviously

25:39.640 --> 25:40.640
<i>you've got my phone!</i>

25:40.960 --> 25:43.395
I was looking for you,
you disappeared on me.

25:43.840 --> 25:46.992
I'm in a cafe on Eldon street?

25:57.680 --> 25:59.831
That's one mystery solved.
HOLLY: One down.

26:00.120 --> 26:02.520
I saw the news, you really
must have been in the thick of it.

26:02.640 --> 26:04.154
Yeah, I don't have long.

26:04.640 --> 26:07.640
I've been a wreck all morning, Holly,
what did you want to talk to me about?

26:53.000 --> 26:54.480
Haven't you got anything
better to do?

26:55.640 --> 26:57.680
Did you get the downloads done
from that hard drive.

They had a couple of stringers
following up on it.

27:06.960 --> 27:07.960
Asking what?

27:08.520 --> 27:10.796
Is he a suspect.
No, he's not a suspect.

27:11.360 --> 27:13.336
Tell them he's a neighbour.
That's what we told them.

27:13.360 --> 27:14.800
Doesn't mean they're gonna print it.

28:21.720 --> 28:22.720
That's my wife.

28:23.600 --> 28:24.875
That's my fucking wife!

28:25.200 --> 28:27.556
They've got the shooter

29:02.960 --> 29:04.599
Are you hurt.
Yeah, no, I'm fine.

29:04.680 --> 29:05.750

29:07.680 --> 29:08.680
HE SIGHS

29:08.880 --> 29:10.234
Hey, I'm not going nowhere.

29:11.680 --> 29:13.194
Oh, what are you doing here?

29:15.680 --> 29:16.909
Holly...

29:17.800 --> 29:19.359
I was just getting my phone back.

29:19.840 --> 29:21.274
Did you talk to Holly?

29:22.920 --> 29:24.195
Have you spoken to Holly?

29:26.840 --> 29:28.672
Hey, what?

29:31.920 --> 29:33.115
What?

29:34.400 --> 29:35.629
She's gone.

29:44.840 --> 29:46.593
LADY JUSTICE SPENCER:
CCTV clearly shows

29:46.680 --> 29:49.400
that DC Morton was the first
victim of the attack.

29:50.200 --> 29:51.759
Do you believe she was targeted.

29:54.560 --> 29:56.916
I'm unable to discuss
that in an open forum.

29:57.720 --> 29:58.870
Just keep it rolling.

29:59.280 --> 30:02.512
Let's see if we can find some subjects
that you don't mind discussing.

30:03.800 --> 30:04.916
I'll answer what I can.

30:07.480 --> 30:09.915
LADY JUSTICE:
According to standard operating procedure

30:10.000 --> 30:12.560
you would have been one of the
designated officers on the scene.

30:12.640 --> 30:13.640
Is that correct?

30:14.120 --> 30:15.156
Normally, yes.

30:16.000 --> 30:17.480
LADY JUSTICE:
But this was not normal?

30:19.160 --> 30:20.674
After the death of DC Morton

30:20.760 --> 30:22.797
I was removed from the investigation.

30:24.200 --> 30:27.238
Witness K, was the perpetrator
known to you at this time?

30:36.000 --> 30:37.116
HE COUGHS

30:38.120 --> 30:40.396
I can't discuss that in an open forum.

RECORDER BEEPS OFF

30:45.960 --> 30:49.510
Witness K, was the perpetrator
known to you at this time?

30:53.040 --> 30:54.040
Yes, he was.

30:55.040 --> 30:57.396
In what capacity
was he known to you?

31:34.560 --> 31:37.917
How was Akash Williams known
to your department?

31:38.200 --> 31:40.157
He was on GCHQ's watch list

31:40.240 --> 31:42.596
for sharing extremist content online.

31:43.760 --> 31:46.036
GABE: He was interviewed
on numerous occasions

31:46.120 --> 31:48.919
but was deemed not to be
an immediate threat.

31:56.400 --> 31:57.550
AOASH: Bro, what you sayin'?

31:57.920 --> 32:00.360
Kash, what are you doing?
I thought you weren't talking to me.

32:00.800 --> 32:02.712
I got words coming out my mouth
don't I?

32:02.960 --> 32:04.076
Yeah, cool.

32:07.160 --> 32:09.038
They're saying I gotta have
another operation.

32:10.360 --> 32:11.589
My fingers are all messed up.

32:12.480 --> 32:14.200
I didn't know Raza was going
to do anything.

32:14.960 --> 32:16.519
He's like, pretty mental now.

32:16.640 --> 32:17.471
Where is he at then?

32:17.560 --> 32:18.914
He had something with the police.

32:19.520 --> 32:20.590
They raided the house.

32:21.080 --> 32:22.080
Come.

32:22.560 --> 32:24.233
Let's go yours, play some death match.

32:24.320 --> 32:25.436
Yeah, after school.

32:26.360 --> 32:28.560
You're not even dressed
for school, where are you going?

32:29.680 --> 32:31.751
Mufti day. Classes are literally
about to start.

32:31.840 --> 32:33.399
What are they gonna teach
you in there?

32:34.440 --> 32:37.201
Anything that's worth learning, yeah,
you'll find out yourself, innit.

32:38.120 --> 32:40.555
Come on, we'll have our own
"mufti day".

32:41.680 --> 32:43.560
You know it's the only time
you'll ever beat me.

32:47.040 --> 32:48.679
Hello, anyone home?

32:49.640 --> 32:50.920
What time are they getting back?

32:51.600 --> 32:52.920
I don't know,
probably after work.

32:55.080 --> 32:57.311
You shoes.
I don't need my feet getting cold.

32:57.560 --> 32:59.870
Kash, you'll get dirt on the carpet,
<i>Ammi</i> will flip!

33:00.040 --> 33:02.032
AKASH'S FEET THUMP UPSTAIRS

33:05.600 --> 33:07.319
Where's all of your bother's stuff?

33:07.720 --> 33:10.030
Told you, Raz got kicked out
after all that drama.

33:10.120 --> 33:11.120
You didn't say that.

33:11.280 --> 33:12.536
Alright, well I'm saying it now.

33:12.560 --> 33:13.630
And where is he then?

33:13.760 --> 33:14.760
I don't know.

33:15.440 --> 33:17.159
AKASH, SHOUTING:
Well, find out, call him!

33:17.280 --> 33:19.176
What for? You're weirding me out.
I said, call him.

33:19.200 --> 33:20.236
For what though?

33:20.400 --> 33:21.629
Your brother is a terrorist

33:21.720 --> 33:23.056
so don't go on like you don't know.

33:23.080 --> 33:24.594
Raza? Yeah, hilarious!

33:24.720 --> 33:26.837
Well, everyone
in Bridgetown knows it, hm?

33:27.240 --> 33:29.080
This morning,
it's all anyone could talk about.

33:34.240 --> 33:36.197
Cops have arrested a whole cell

33:36.360 --> 33:38.158
and Raza was in with them.

33:40.880 --> 33:42.216
WOMAN'S VOICE ON VIDEO:
<i>He's come through my garden...</i>

33:42.240 --> 33:44.391
See! Says here he trained in Pakistan.

33:44.600 --> 33:46.034
He's never even left the country.

33:46.400 --> 33:48.198
Oh, yeah, what you think he'd tell you?

33:49.360 --> 33:50.360
Check it for yourself.

33:51.480 --> 33:54.136
WOMAN: <i>I heard gunshots and everything,
they won't tell me nothing though...</i>

33:54.160 --> 33:55.960
<i>The neighbours say
it's just like Rotterdam...</i>

33:56.000 --> 33:57.000
This is all bullshit.

33:57.880 --> 34:00.349
Rotterdam?
What's this thing about Rotterdam?

34:01.000 --> 34:02.195
I hope he's dead.

34:02.800 --> 34:03.800
How could you say that?

34:03.920 --> 34:04.956
He killed my car.

34:05.320 --> 34:06.800
And if they don't shoot him,
I will.

34:06.880 --> 34:08.996
Stop joking,
I'm trying to find out where he is.

34:09.639 --> 34:11.438
It says he's at London City Hospital.

34:11.600 --> 34:13.800
AKASH SHOUTING:
Does this look like a funny joke to you?

34:14.199 --> 34:15.270
Yeah, like that's real!

34:15.600 --> 34:17.670
AKASH: It is, it's heavy,
it's legit.

34:17.880 --> 34:19.679
It's not real, Kash.
Alright, I'll show you.

34:20.040 --> 34:21.040
Yeah, whatever.

34:21.239 --> 34:22.356

34:24.159 --> 34:25.159

34:25.560 --> 34:27.233
The recall on that is solid.

34:27.880 --> 34:29.518
AKASH: Ah, no!
- NASIR: Give me that!

34:29.639 --> 34:31.233
AKASH:
Don't wave that at me, man, yo!

34:31.320 --> 34:32.976
AKASH: Stop, stop, man.
- NASIR: You want to kill Raza?

34:33.000 --> 34:34.514
- AKASH: Stop, idiot!
- GUNSHOT.

34:39.400 --> 34:40.516
Witness K...

34:41.040 --> 34:44.078
Do you believe the assailant
had prior intent?

34:48.600 --> 34:49.795
In his head, he thinks

34:49.880 --> 34:52.270
his friend is dead,
so obviously he's very...

34:53.679 --> 34:55.751
distressed and alone.

34:56.960 --> 34:58.917
GUNSHOT - AKASH GASPS

LADY JUSTICE:
In your professional opinion

35:56.160 --> 35:57.674
did his behaviour match that

35:57.760 --> 36:00.195
of someone about to carry out
a pre-planned attack?

36:02.840 --> 36:05.719
There's no fixed pattern
for these incidents.

36:08.080 --> 36:09.309
GABE: Was he trained... no.

36:10.200 --> 36:12.192
Was he recruited? No, he wasn't.

36:13.760 --> 36:15.160
Was he radicalised?

36:15.960 --> 36:17.440
Not by an ideology, no.

36:19.800 --> 36:21.029
Maybe, by life?

36:22.200 --> 36:24.040
GABE: I mean, everything
fell apart around him.

36:24.480 --> 36:27.200
He was either gonna to find someone
to help him or someone to blame.

36:28.280 --> 36:30.040
Maybe the right person was
in the wrong place

36:30.120 --> 36:32.589
or the wrong person was
in the right place. I don't know.

36:33.200 --> 36:34.520
It's just conjecture.

36:35.640 --> 36:37.120
In all honesty, I mean...

36:38.120 --> 36:39.349
What does it matter?

36:41.760 --> 36:43.399
The dead don't know the difference.

36:48.240 --> 36:49.680
POLICEMAN:
What you after, young man?

36:51.040 --> 36:52.679
Nothing.
This is a restricted zone

36:52.760 --> 36:54.672
here, I'm afraid.
I'll need you to move on.

36:56.720 --> 36:58.560
ARMED GUARD: Through there.
- NURSE: Thank you.

37:02.040 --> 37:03.997
LADY JUSTICE:
You notified the parents.

37:05.280 --> 37:06.316
Is that correct?

37:06.640 --> 37:07.994
Is that normal practice?

37:09.680 --> 37:11.592
Due to increased media scrutiny

37:11.680 --> 37:14.752
we tried to notify the families
before their names are leaked to the press.

37:16.080 --> 37:18.549
Were they at all aware
of what their son was capable of?

37:18.640 --> 37:19.640
No.

37:20.200 --> 37:21.634
We completely flattened them.

37:22.200 --> 37:24.920
We might as well have walked
through their door with a wrecking ball.

37:30.520 --> 37:31.520
ROSE: Gabe?

37:31.920 --> 37:32.920
Come on.

37:41.560 --> 37:43.000
OFFICER: Where do you want me, skip?

37:43.360 --> 37:44.760
ROSE: Out front if you don't mind.

37:46.520 --> 37:47.874
- You in charge?
- DOOR SLAMS.

37:48.240 --> 37:50.038
We've been sitting around
30 minutes now.

37:50.720 --> 37:51.936
I had to send all the punters home.

37:51.960 --> 37:52.960
What is this?

37:53.480 --> 37:56.040
DCI Asante, this is DS Waters.

37:56.800 --> 37:58.656
Why don't you sit down?
SADIA: I don't want to sit down.

37:58.680 --> 38:00.194
Just tell me, what has Raza done?

38:00.400 --> 38:02.392
ROSE:
I'm afraid we're here to discuss Nasir.

38:05.000 --> 38:06.336
GABE:
Earlier this morning we believe

38:06.360 --> 38:09.080
that your son opened fire
on a café full of civilians.

38:10.600 --> 38:13.240
We don't yet know the full extent
of the casualties but...

38:13.360 --> 38:14.589
at least three...

38:15.440 --> 38:17.591
four people are deceased.

38:17.960 --> 38:19.576
SADIA: No, no no.
- HANIF: You couldn't be more wrong.

38:19.600 --> 38:21.000
SADIA:
Nasir wouldn't hurt anybody.

38:21.080 --> 38:22.958
HANIF:
Where would he even get a bloody gun?

38:23.040 --> 38:24.040
Just let me talk to him.

38:24.640 --> 38:26.279
And then...
we'll know what's happening.

38:28.960 --> 38:29.960
Sorry.

38:32.720 --> 38:34.040
GABE: No...

38:34.160 --> 38:35.719
I'm afraid your son has passed away.

38:36.200 --> 38:37.554
Just, like I said...

38:37.800 --> 38:39.473
let me talk to him, OK?
GABE: Mr Shar.

38:39.800 --> 38:41.200
Your son took his own life.

38:42.680 --> 38:43.909
NASIR: Let me see my brother.

38:44.120 --> 38:45.120
I need to see my brother.

38:48.760 --> 38:50.114
WOMAN: Are you alright, love?

38:50.760 --> 38:52.114
There's blood on your shoes.

38:52.720 --> 38:53.720
HE GRUNTS

38:54.400 --> 38:57.393
Honestly mate, are you sure you're OK?
You don't look great.

38:59.240 --> 39:01.277
WOMAN: Hello... Anyone...

39:06.880 --> 39:08.075
NASIR BREATHES HEAVILY

39:08.160 --> 39:08.991
GUNSHOT - SCREAMING

39:09.160 --> 39:10.037
No, no, no.

39:10.120 --> 39:12.112
It's not him, he's at school, I'll...

39:12.240 --> 39:13.799
I'll call him, he's at school!

39:13.880 --> 39:15.678
A grief counsellor will visit you shortly.

39:16.400 --> 39:18.551
ROSE:
In the meantime are there any friends

39:18.640 --> 39:20.552
or family that you'd like us to notify.

39:27.320 --> 39:28.913
SADIA SOBS: Oh, no...

39:29.000 --> 39:30.229
SADIA: Not my boy.

39:30.520 --> 39:32.637
He wouldn't do that to me!

39:33.000 --> 39:34.195
Not my boy...

39:44.360 --> 39:45.680
You said I'd be out this morning.

39:46.360 --> 39:48.192
You took my phone, my TV's broke.

39:48.720 --> 39:49.995
Got me wearing this shit.

39:51.080 --> 39:53.072
There's now three armed geezers
standing outside

39:53.160 --> 39:54.480
and no one's telling me anything.

40:07.600 --> 40:11.879
INAUDIBLE DIALOGUE

40:29.560 --> 40:30.816
LADY JUSTICE:
We will now continue

40:30.840 --> 40:32.718
the testimony of witness K.

40:33.080 --> 40:35.879
An officer in the Counter Terrorism
Specialist Unit.

40:38.320 --> 40:39.320
RECORDING DEVICE BEEPS

40:40.640 --> 40:42.416
JUSTICE'S VOICE RECORDED:
<i>Witness K, was the perpetrator</i>

40:42.440 --> 40:43.840
<i>know to you at this time?</i>

40:47.280 --> 40:48.280
GABE COUGHS

40:49.600 --> 40:52.040
GABE'S VOICE DISTORTED:
<i>I can't discuss that in an open forum.</i>

40:55.320 --> 40:57.896
JUSTICE'S VOICE RECORDED:
<i>Do you now believe that there's anything</i>

40:57.920 --> 40:59.274
<i>you would have done differently</i>

40:59.440 --> 41:00.590
<i>to prevent this?</i>

41:01.280 --> 41:02.440
GABES' VOICE DISTORTED: <i>Uh...</i>

41:02.840 --> 41:03.840
<i>Everything.</i>

41:04.640 --> 41:05.835
LADY JUSTICE: <i>Excuse me?</i>

41:06.600 --> 41:08.416
GABE'S VOICE DISTORTED:
<i>I would have called the café</i>

41:08.440 --> 41:09.840
<i>told them not to open up.</i>

41:10.360 --> 41:11.953
<i>I'd have called everyone in London</i>

41:12.040 --> 41:13.520
<i>and told them to stay at home.</i>

41:14.240 --> 41:15.799
<i>But who can see what's coming?</i>

41:17.280 --> 41:19.317
<i>To pretend that we can is just, uh...</i>

41:19.960 --> 41:21.110
<i>a fantasy, isn't it?</i>

41:25.520 --> 41:27.920
LADY JUSTICE: <i>But would you
still have recruited source nine.</i>

41:29.360 --> 41:31.397
GABE'S VOICE DISTORTED:
<i>Excuse me? Who?</i>

41:31.720 --> 41:32.790
LADY JUSTICE: <i>I'm asking</i>

41:33.320 --> 41:35.198
<i>would you still have recruited</i>

41:35.320 --> 41:36.640
<i>source nine?</i>

41:39.040 --> 41:41.555
GABE'S VOICE DISTORTED:
<i>I won't discuss that in an open forum.</i>

41:43.200 --> 41:45.669
LADY JUSTICE: <i>Following on
from the events of November 29th...</i>

41:50.800 --> 41:51.870
COURT DISCUSSION CONTINUES

41:51.960 --> 41:52.996
MEGAN: Emily.

41:58.480 --> 41:59.630
It's been ages.

42:00.040 --> 42:01.520
- Megan.
- Megan, sorry.

42:01.720 --> 42:03.598
I'm surprised you remember me.
It's alright.

42:04.240 --> 42:07.392
I can count on one hand the number
of people Holly had round at our flat.

42:08.480 --> 42:10.416
Two of those fingers were for
you and your husband.

42:10.440 --> 42:11.440
Oh...

42:11.640 --> 42:12.676
MEGAN: Gabe, was it?

42:13.800 --> 42:16.076
I'm so sorry about Holly.

42:17.600 --> 42:19.034
Not that it counts for anything.

42:19.240 --> 42:20.594
Everything counts for something.

42:21.320 --> 42:22.436
At least...

42:22.680 --> 42:24.592
that's how Holly always looked at things.

42:26.760 --> 42:28.797
She always read into people.

42:29.520 --> 42:30.795
What you did, what you said.

42:31.680 --> 42:33.136
A bit of a nightmare as a sister, but...

42:33.160 --> 42:35.117
no doubt it had it's merits for the police.

42:35.280 --> 42:36.999
Gabe spoke really highly of her work.

42:37.240 --> 42:38.310
I'm sure he did.

42:42.880 --> 42:44.599
Was it a good catch up?

42:47.160 --> 42:48.230
In the court you said that

42:48.480 --> 42:49.834
you met with Holly to catch up.

42:53.240 --> 42:54.674
We didn't really get round to it.

42:55.800 --> 42:56.800
Right.

42:57.720 --> 42:58.995
It's just...

42:59.440 --> 43:01.909
"Catching up" was not really
Holly's style, you know?

43:06.800 --> 43:08.234
We met for coffee.

43:09.680 --> 43:12.195
He started shooting before I even sat down.

43:12.280 --> 43:13.640
I don't know what else
to tell you.

43:17.240 --> 43:19.994
Holly, would probably scratch her chin
a little bit on that.

43:21.880 --> 43:25.078
Especially as your husband was ringing
our doorbell about 2am the night before.

43:26.600 --> 43:28.034
Sorry, Gabe was doing what?

43:28.920 --> 43:31.120
Well, that's what you two were
meeting about, wasn't it?

43:32.640 --> 43:33.960
No, she was...

43:37.240 --> 43:38.240
SHE SIGHS

43:40.560 --> 43:42.800
MEGAN: You honestly
have no idea who you married, do you?

43:43.640 --> 43:44.640
Well, don't worry.

43:45.240 --> 43:46.680
They were probably just catching up.

43:53.240 --> 43:54.879
Say "hi" to Charlie for me.

44:00.160 --> 44:01.389
CLERK OF THE COURT: All rise.

44:14.680 --> 44:15.955
Sorry about the wait.

44:17.680 --> 44:18.716
GABE: Everything alright?

44:20.040 --> 44:21.040
SEATBELT CLICKS

44:22.920 --> 44:23.920
Just thinking.

44:23.960 --> 44:25.280
That's dangerous, what you got?

44:27.520 --> 44:29.477
Why did you get "Witness K"?

44:30.400 --> 44:32.960
Why not Witness A?
Why do you get the Wizard of Oz treatment?

44:33.200 --> 44:34.200
GABE: I don't know.

44:34.600 --> 44:35.716
K for Kudos?

44:36.880 --> 44:37.916
O for Kinky.

44:40.160 --> 44:42.231
O for you're full of crap.

44:43.240 --> 44:44.240
Yeah, usually.

44:45.840 --> 44:47.120
GABE: What times the man coming?

44:47.360 --> 44:50.353
EMILY: Three. I can drop you off
at work if you can't make it.

44:50.520 --> 44:52.034
GABE: No, no, I'll make time.

44:53.120 --> 44:55.476
INDISTINCT CHATTER

45:11.320 --> 45:12.320
Rizla!

45:12.680 --> 45:13.955
Hold up, man.

45:14.400 --> 45:15.880
I didn't skid all the way over here

45:15.960 --> 45:17.758
to have your mug
on full display now, did I?

45:19.160 --> 45:21.436
Clerk said they should be
done with testimony next week.

45:21.560 --> 45:22.630
- Next week?
- Yeah.

45:22.720 --> 45:23.720
Sweet.

45:23.880 --> 45:25.712
Any longer and I'll have to get
a side car.

45:26.160 --> 45:27.276
Can you imagine?

45:29.560 --> 45:30.835
What did they go over today?

45:31.400 --> 45:32.550
Same old.

45:33.520 --> 45:34.600
DADIR: What you looking at?

45:35.000 --> 45:36.416
RAZA: I don't know why
I keep coming back.

45:36.440 --> 45:38.477
DADIR SIGHS
Just do what you gotta do.

45:38.560 --> 45:39.914
However long you need, yeah?

45:41.960 --> 45:43.400
Come on, let's get out of here, man.

45:45.680 --> 45:47.176
REPORTER:
The judge today regarding source Y.

45:47.200 --> 45:49.078
AKASH:
Nasir, was more than a terrorist.

45:49.160 --> 45:50.514
He was government trained.

45:50.920 --> 45:52.434
It's just a front for MI6.

45:53.000 --> 45:54.560
That's how they keep it all covered up.

45:54.600 --> 45:55.600
Think about that!

46:58.120 --> 46:59.120
PHONE BEEPS

47:01.160 --> 47:04.119
Alright, number 7 can me in an hour
at Shadwell.

47:08.600 --> 47:09.636
Earth to Gabe.

47:09.960 --> 47:11.030
Earth to Gabe!

47:11.320 --> 47:12.356
Shadwell in an hour.

47:12.680 --> 47:14.558
Yeah, whatever he wants.

47:25.920 --> 47:27.559
GABE:
Be on the lookout for new snouts

47:27.960 --> 47:29.320
and don't bother with the mosques.

47:29.640 --> 47:32.235
All my best assets are from
the devil's wish list already

47:33.040 --> 47:34.759
like junkies, dealers, pervs

47:35.000 --> 47:36.559
anyone you can get leverage on.

47:37.480 --> 47:38.516
Remember...

47:38.680 --> 47:40.637
they'll turn on their own
family, friends

47:40.720 --> 47:43.076
grass on them.
They'll just as easily turn on you.

47:43.800 --> 47:45.553
They're not your mates.
INFORMER: Boss?

47:49.960 --> 47:51.633
No, I don't know him.

47:52.280 --> 47:53.760
But I keep my eyes open for you.

47:54.520 --> 47:55.520
Good man.

47:55.880 --> 47:57.109
INFORMER: Thank you, boss.

47:58.120 --> 48:00.351
GABE:
You squeeze them, rinse them.

48:00.600 --> 48:02.956
They give you any trouble
you drop them, move on.

48:59.400 --> 49:00.400
CHARLOTTE: Raza.

49:01.320 --> 49:03.198
Hey, hey.

49:04.360 --> 49:06.079
Charlotte, how you been?

49:06.800 --> 49:09.076
Yeah, good. Really good.
How about you?

49:10.240 --> 49:11.720
CHARLOTTE:
That was a stupid question.

49:12.480 --> 49:13.656
I've been following the news.
Um...

49:13.680 --> 49:15.558
What are you doing this far east?

49:16.680 --> 49:17.796
The end of year show.

49:18.520 --> 49:20.432
RAZA:
Don't remember posing for this one.

49:21.280 --> 49:23.158
Straight "A" s I suspect.
SHE LAUGHS.

49:24.240 --> 49:25.560
Yep, it's not really...

49:26.000 --> 49:28.390
graded alphabetically but yeah,
almost done.

49:30.840 --> 49:32.240
How about you? What are you up to?

49:33.480 --> 49:36.314
Just trying to steer
clear of drama, mainly.

49:41.400 --> 49:42.516
You know, um...

49:44.640 --> 49:47.030
What they wrote in the papers...
I didn't mean it like that.

49:47.120 --> 49:49.510
The reporter was outside my halls
after a big night out.

49:49.960 --> 49:51.235
So that's not what you said?

49:55.800 --> 49:56.800
I was rat-arsed.

49:56.920 --> 49:57.920
I...

49:58.120 --> 49:59.600
They took it out of context.

50:00.080 --> 50:02.754
Hm, they have a habit of doing that.

50:03.840 --> 50:05.440
That's why I tend to keep my mouth shut.

50:07.520 --> 50:08.520
See you around.

50:12.800 --> 50:13.800
Oh, shit!

50:14.120 --> 50:15.156
Razi, how goes it?

50:19.320 --> 50:21.676
Fucking hell, what's he doing here?
He lives round here.

50:52.280 --> 50:54.351
RAZA SHOUTS:
Terrorist's got three "r" s, dickheads!

51:01.160 --> 51:04.039
DOOR LOCK CLICKS.
CHANTING IN ARABIC

51:23.400 --> 51:28.236
HANIF CHANTING IN ARABIC

51:54.240 --> 51:55.515
RAZA SIGHS

52:33.320 --> 52:34.320
BELL DINGS

52:36.000 --> 52:37.000
He...

52:39.480 --> 52:40.480
Delivery.

52:41.280 --> 52:42.280
It's for you.

52:43.600 --> 52:45.990
You didn't have to come all this way
just for that.

52:48.280 --> 52:50.033
Maybe I came to get my teeth bleached.

52:51.480 --> 52:54.154
Oh, this bloody address,
I keep calling Royal Mail but...

52:54.480 --> 52:56.597
there's always some company
with the old one.

53:01.000 --> 53:02.036
Are you moving back?

53:02.160 --> 53:04.117
No, no, no, just a quick holiday.

53:05.000 --> 53:08.391
Now I have this passport,
I thought "why not", hm?

53:09.800 --> 53:10.916
You were born there.

53:12.160 --> 53:13.355
Just don't see what these

53:13.560 --> 53:16.280
travel guide <i>goras</i> can possibly tell you
that you don't already know.

53:16.360 --> 53:18.079
A lot changes in 20 years.

53:18.160 --> 53:20.720
You used to swear up and down,
"Nothing ever changes there, <i>beta</i>

53:20.800 --> 53:23.315
except the weather".
That and a bloody coup every six months.

53:23.360 --> 53:24.360
Miss Khalil?

53:25.560 --> 53:27.376
DENTIST:
Can you book Susan in for a follow-up?

53:27.400 --> 53:29.040
She needs an impression
for a crown mould.

53:29.840 --> 53:30.840
SADIA: Of course.

53:37.840 --> 53:40.116
They scheduled the closing statement
for next week.

53:40.960 --> 53:42.917
I'm going and... Abu's coming too.

53:43.000 --> 53:45.390
I think if we all go as a family...
A statement for what?

53:45.480 --> 53:46.516
The inquest.

53:47.000 --> 53:49.469
It's like a final summation,
or whatever.

53:49.560 --> 53:50.914
No, you don't need me there.

53:51.120 --> 53:52.713
- Everyone gawking...
- Let them.

53:53.200 --> 53:54.873
- Who cares?
- I bloody do!

53:55.160 --> 53:56.480
He wasn't even my son!

54:03.040 --> 54:04.918
Oh, but I didn't mean it like that.

54:05.120 --> 54:06.120
Cool, cool.

54:06.160 --> 54:08.656
No, <i>beta</i>, I didn't mean it like that.
RAZA: Yeah, send me a postcard.

54:08.680 --> 54:09.976
Yeah, it's all good.
SADIA: No, no, no, no...

54:10.000 --> 54:11.400
Back at it, Miss Ohalil!

54:40.640 --> 54:42.921
RECORDED ANNOUNCEMENT:
<i>Change for stations towards Beckton</i>

54:43.000 --> 54:45.390
<i>and London City Airport.</i>

54:53.560 --> 54:55.216
GABE: How's everything
going in the world, alright?

54:55.240 --> 54:56.310
Never is.

55:01.320 --> 55:02.320
Clover?

55:02.840 --> 55:04.638
What's that?
It's your new alias.

55:04.760 --> 55:06.592
Number nine, got burned on the stand today.

55:06.680 --> 55:07.680
RAZA: Clover?

55:08.240 --> 55:09.276
Clover...

55:10.080 --> 55:11.480
I'm not even Irish.

55:11.880 --> 55:13.030
Can't I be called like...

55:13.280 --> 55:14.680
"viper" or "wolf"

55:15.000 --> 55:16.150
"shadow" or something?

55:16.520 --> 55:17.840
You're not a gladiator.

55:19.000 --> 55:20.960
I thought you were done
with going to the inquest.

55:21.120 --> 55:22.920
What can they tell you
you don't already know?

55:25.800 --> 55:26.916
I don't know.

55:28.200 --> 55:29.475
Why he did it.

55:32.280 --> 55:33.839
Why does anyone do anything?

55:35.240 --> 55:37.072
- It's just people.
- No.

55:37.520 --> 55:38.556
It's my brother.

55:42.120 --> 55:44.032
It's the worst thing about
this business.

55:45.480 --> 55:48.075
You spend a lot of time
counting the lives we lose.

55:49.280 --> 55:51.033
No one's counting the ones we saved.

55:55.400 --> 55:56.470
Yeah, OK.

55:57.600 --> 55:58.600
RAZA: Whatever.

55:59.160 --> 56:00.230
Close your eyes.

56:00.840 --> 56:02.069
For real? Like...

56:02.520 --> 56:03.520
here?

56:03.920 --> 56:04.920
Yeah.

56:05.080 --> 56:06.400
On a plane, on a train

56:06.760 --> 56:07.760
it doesn't matter.

56:08.240 --> 56:09.390
Close your eyes.

56:20.160 --> 56:21.160
Are you there?

56:21.240 --> 56:22.515
Well, you can see me can't you?

56:23.160 --> 56:24.389
Are you there?

56:26.800 --> 56:28.029
Yeah, I'm here.

56:28.560 --> 56:29.789
Where's here?

56:30.920 --> 56:32.798
Home... bathroom.

56:34.320 --> 56:35.720
GABE: What does it smell like?

56:36.920 --> 56:37.920
Coconut.

56:38.280 --> 56:39.280
GABE: Why coconut?

56:39.400 --> 56:40.720
You know why.

56:42.320 --> 56:43.320
GABE: Humour me.

56:46.320 --> 56:47.320
My <i>ammi...</i>

56:47.840 --> 56:49.991
She used to spray my hair
with that coconut oil.

56:51.920 --> 56:53.354
Are you having your hair cut?

56:55.960 --> 56:57.155
Yeah.

56:57.840 --> 56:59.160
GABE: What does it sound like?

57:01.160 --> 57:03.277
Her scissors snip around my head.

57:04.200 --> 57:05.395
Water's running.

57:05.720 --> 57:06.756
It's too hot.

57:07.600 --> 57:09.557
It's always too hot,
but I couldn't care less.

57:09.640 --> 57:10.676
I'm in stitches.

57:11.920 --> 57:13.115
What's so funny?

57:15.080 --> 57:16.673
She already cut my dad's hair

57:16.760 --> 57:18.114
and he's showing it off to Nas.

57:18.600 --> 57:20.114
My brother's freaking the hell out

57:20.840 --> 57:23.355
cos he's never seen my dad
without a beard.

57:23.680 --> 57:25.433
