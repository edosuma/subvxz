out half the force.

was me, DA Clayton.

tomorrow, DSI Grey?

that you've got a friend

05:23.320 --> 05:25.440
who lives here, Eva Alexandri.

More of an associate
than a friend.

05:27.600 --> 05:30.280
And you've got no idea what
she's been up to to bring

05:30.320 --> 05:31.800
us all out at this hour?

05:31.840 --> 05:34.600
I'm sure I'm as eager to

DS ORWELL: His name is
Han Wai, an employee

05:45.320 --> 05:50.760
at Tin Hau Enterprises, Korea
company based in Hong Kong.

05:50.800 --> 05:57.120
He was beaten with a large metal
object and his neck broken.

We found fingerprints
on both temples.

06:00.800 --> 06:02.520
Three guesses who
they belong, Clayton.

06:02.560 --> 06:04.000
Ma'am, this
doesn't feel right.

06:04.040 --> 06:05.480
Eve Alexandri is not a killer.

06:05.520 --> 06:08.000
The evidence
suggests otherwise.

06:08.040 --> 06:09.320
Are we certain
that there was no

06:09.360 --> 06:10.520
one else with her at the scene?

06:10.560 --> 06:12.640
Forensics came up clean.

06:12.680 --> 06:15.280
I'm curious, Clayton, why are
you so keen on protecting her?

06:15.320 --> 06:17.560
She's just your
informant isn't she?

06:17.600 --> 06:19.160
You and I both know
that's a gray area.

You and I both know
that's a shite area.

06:24.560 --> 06:26.560

problem with me, ma'am?

06:26.600 --> 06:28.320
Absolutely, I do.

and a state of the art

06:30.800 --> 06:32.480

06:32.520 --> 06:33.800
And all because of the
trouble that you've

06:33.840 --> 06:35.240
brought into our house.

06:35.280 --> 06:36.360
I have given a full
report on my involvement

06:36.400 --> 06:37.360
with the Isabella
Augustine case.

06:37.400 --> 06:38.360
But I haven't given mine yet.

passed through Heathrow

06:44.200 --> 06:46.680

06:46.720 --> 06:49.320
DI Chohan, I need
you to find her.

06:49.360 --> 06:51.160
Bring her in.

06:51.200 --> 06:52.560
DI, ma'am?

06:52.600 --> 06:55.120
I think it's about time
you stepped up, don't you?

06:55.160 --> 06:56.160
Yes.

06:56.200 --> 06:59.200
I mean, yes ma'am, thank you.

06:59.240 --> 07:04.440
Ma'am, DS, DI Chohan
is a good police officer.

07:04.480 --> 07:05.760
But there's only one
person in this room

07:05.800 --> 07:07.520
who's capable of getting
close to Eve Alexandri.

07:07.560 --> 07:08.360
That person is me.

07:08.400 --> 07:09.720
No, I can do it, ma'am.

07:09.760 --> 07:11.320
I can.

07:11.360 --> 07:12.600
DS Orwell, what do you think?

07:16.600 --> 07:18.320
I think I'd rather
not get in the ring

07:18.360 --> 07:19.400
with either of them, ma'am.

07:19.440 --> 07:20.800
Fine.

07:20.840 --> 07:22.440

07:45.400 --> 07:46.720
I need to find her.

07:46.760 --> 07:49.240
OK, so I can tag along.

07:49.280 --> 07:51.000
I can wine and dine

killer without smashing

07:52.560 --> 07:54.200
up the city too much.

07:54.240 --> 07:57.040
And then we can go to
New York, happy days.

I wish it was that simple.

07:59.600 --> 08:01.000
Harry.

08:01.040 --> 08:02.360
Yes, I should be
going to New York.

08:02.400 --> 08:03.760
Yes, I should be
getting my family back.

08:03.800 --> 08:05.800
But this always gets in the way.

This is my life now.

08:11.440 --> 08:12.080
So don't go.

08:14.640 --> 08:16.720
Stand down.

08:16.760 --> 08:17.600
Sit this one out.

08:20.560 --> 08:22.360
I can't.

08:22.400 --> 08:25.120

Detective Orwell,
[non-english speech]..

09:38.160 --> 09:40.680
Yeah, no that's all I've got.

09:40.720 --> 09:43.000
I'm sure you're going to pick
some more up as we go along.

09:43.040 --> 09:44.320
Shall we?

09:44.360 --> 09:46.000
Yes, I've prepared a
briefing on a suspect.

09:46.040 --> 09:48.520
And then perhaps we can review
your extradition protocols.

09:48.560 --> 09:50.120
We have time for that later.

09:50.160 --> 09:52.200
Right now your
suspect is out there.

09:52.240 --> 09:53.280
So that is where we shall go.

09:56.600 --> 09:58.080
HARRY CLAYTON: So, you're OCTB.

09:58.120 --> 10:00.560
Does that mean that you
think Han Wai's murder

10:00.600 --> 10:02.000
was connected to the triad?

10:02.040 --> 10:03.560
DETECTIVE SHAOLIN:
Truthfully, we don't know.

10:03.600 --> 10:06.240
Han Wai is not recognized as
a member of any triad society

10:06.280 --> 10:07.720
operating in Hong Kong.

10:07.760 --> 10:10.720
DS ORWELL: What about his
employers, Tin Hau Enterprises?

10:10.760 --> 10:11.800
DETECTIVE SHAOLIN:
Not registered,

10:11.840 --> 10:13.400
most likely a front.

10:13.440 --> 10:15.240
SURI CHOHAN: So we
don't know who he is

10:15.280 --> 10:16.600
or why he was in London.

10:16.640 --> 10:18.280
DETECTIVE SHAOLIN:
No, but he's the key.

10:18.320 --> 10:18.800
So we go ask.

10:18.840 --> 10:19.480
[clinking]

anything in these pictures

10:36.720 --> 10:37.760
that can help us?

10:37.800 --> 10:39.680
For instance, what
about this one?

10:39.720 --> 10:41.200
[moped]

SURI CHOHAN: Look, could that
be a tattoo under the scar?

10:58.040 --> 10:59.760
Look closely.

10:59.800 --> 11:06.720
This scar hides something,
a badge of honor.

11:10.600 --> 11:15.320

What did he say?

11:16.400 --> 11:18.040
The light against darkness.

11:18.080 --> 11:22.080
They're also called the torches,
a very old triad society,

11:22.120 --> 11:23.360
once very powerful.

11:23.400 --> 11:26.360
But they have been
active in maybe 30 years.

11:26.400 --> 11:27.760
But they are not dead.

11:27.800 --> 11:30.040
They are just asleep.

11:30.080 --> 11:33.720
We think this
woman killed Han Wai.

11:33.760 --> 11:36.040
She came to Hong
Kong two days ago.

11:36.080 --> 11:37.040
We need to find her.

11:47.800 --> 11:49.640
If I tell you, they're
going to kill me.

11:49.680 --> 11:52.560
And what will they do if we
tell everyone on this street

11:52.600 --> 11:55.200
that you're a police informant?

11:55.240 --> 11:56.400
How would you like that, Lenny?

11:59.720 --> 12:01.240
OK.

12:01.280 --> 12:05.160
The torches are looking
for this woman too.

12:05.200 --> 12:07.080
They give out this.

12:07.120 --> 12:09.480
When we see this woman
to call that number.

12:13.000 --> 12:18.200
SURI CHOHAN: Thank you for
your cooperation, Mr. Kwan.

12:18.240 --> 12:20.280
DS ORWELL: I think will call
that, round one to Suri.

12:27.160 --> 12:28.480
[music playing]

12:31.440 --> 12:33.760
[phone ringing]

12:33.800 --> 12:35.360
Come on, love.

12:35.400 --> 12:36.760
[phone ringing]

12:40.360 --> 12:41.000
SURI CHOHAN: Daisy?

12:43.800 --> 12:44.400
Yeah.

12:44.440 --> 12:45.800
No answer.

12:45.840 --> 12:48.800
I was supposed to call
yesterday but was too busy.

12:48.840 --> 12:50.520
Well, it's early in New York.

12:50.560 --> 12:54.120
She might not be up yet.

12:54.160 --> 12:55.680
So--

12:55.720 --> 12:59.160
Oh, I know that so.

12:59.200 --> 13:00.680
You're my partner, Harry.

13:00.720 --> 13:02.600
I got this far because of you.

13:02.640 --> 13:03.640
I don't want to fight.

13:03.680 --> 13:05.360
I want us to work together.

13:05.400 --> 13:06.760
Great.

13:06.800 --> 13:09.040
OK, well then admit that
there's something about all

13:09.080 --> 13:10.680
of this that just feels wrong.

13:10.720 --> 13:12.440
Eve couldn't have killed
that man on her own.

13:12.480 --> 13:13.760
There had to be
someone else with her.

13:13.800 --> 13:16.560
Someone forensics
couldn't detect?

13:16.600 --> 13:18.760
Why are you doing this, Harry?

13:18.800 --> 13:21.280
It's not because of
my promotion is it?

13:21.320 --> 13:22.560
No, of course not.

13:22.600 --> 13:26.160
This has nothing
to do with that.

13:26.200 --> 13:27.680
SURI CHOHAN: See,
it all comes back

13:27.720 --> 13:33.280
to this because I've seen that
somewhere before, haven't I?

13:33.320 --> 13:34.720
You mean this old thing.

13:34.760 --> 13:35.680
Did I not tell you the truth?

13:35.720 --> 13:36.720
[inaudible] left this for me.

13:36.760 --> 13:37.480
No, don't do that.

13:37.520 --> 13:39.000
No more stories.

13:39.040 --> 13:41.120
OK, so now it sounds
like your questioning me.

13:41.160 --> 13:43.400
Is that why you were promoted,
Suri, to investigate me?

13:43.440 --> 13:44.640
SURI CHOHAN: I was
promoted because you

13:44.680 --> 13:47.480
taught me to be a good cop.

13:47.520 --> 13:48.560
What about us being friends?

13:48.600 --> 13:50.000
[sigh]

13:50.040 --> 13:51.560
Harry, I desperately
want that but something

13:51.600 --> 13:55.800
always gets in the way, Eve
Alexandri, the bracelet.

13:55.840 --> 14:02.000
So if there's anything you want
to tell me, now is the time.

14:04.320 --> 14:04.760
OK.

14:07.600 --> 14:10.160
OK, no, you're right.
It's time.

14:13.200 --> 14:13.760
So here goes.

14:16.680 --> 14:21.640
This bracelet, Eve gave it to
me and I can't take it off.

14:21.680 --> 14:23.280
It's one of a pair.

14:23.320 --> 14:25.560
They both have a power that
brings their wearers luck,

14:25.600 --> 14:29.240
extraordinarily so but
it comes at a cost.

14:29.280 --> 14:32.280
In this case, it was my family.

14:32.320 --> 14:36.080
So there's some kind of war
brewing over your magical happy

14:36.120 --> 14:37.120
bracelets?

14:37.160 --> 14:38.640
I think so, possibly yes.

14:38.680 --> 14:39.480
[phone ringing]

14:39.520 --> 14:40.720
Great story, Harry.

14:40.760 --> 14:41.760
Well, yeah it should
be because it's--

14:41.800 --> 14:44.320
[footsteps]

14:44.360 --> 14:46.320
[sigh]

14:46.360 --> 14:46.800
--it's true.

14:54.200 --> 14:56.560
For the record, I liked it.

14:56.600 --> 14:59.480
I know, right?

14:59.520 --> 15:01.440
See ya.

15:01.480 --> 15:05.000
There's been a development
in the Isabella Augustine case.

15:05.040 --> 15:07.000
MI6 have managed
to recover footage

15:07.040 --> 15:10.560
from the rooftop cameras
hit by the MIS bomb blast.

15:10.600 --> 15:15.040
Chohan, we can place Clayton
with Augustine moments

15:15.080 --> 15:17.320
before she died.

15:17.360 --> 15:18.080
Right.

15:18.120 --> 15:19.440
Yes, ma'am.

15:19.480 --> 15:21.440
There's something else.

15:21.480 --> 15:24.560
Forensics did a second
sweep of Alexandri's squad.

15:24.600 --> 15:26.320
They found evidence
that suggests

15:26.360 --> 15:31.080
Clayton was there with her at
the time of Han Wai's murder.

15:31.120 --> 15:33.800
Look, ma'am, I know Harry's
complicated but I'm pretty

15:33.840 --> 15:35.360
certain he's not a killer.

15:35.400 --> 15:37.560
I don't need pretty
certain from you, DI Chohan.

15:37.600 --> 15:40.120
I need to know that I can trust
you to do the right thing when

15:40.160 --> 15:42.040
the time comes.

15:42.080 --> 15:44.040
Yes, ma'am.

15:44.080 --> 15:48.400
Until then, you do not let
Clayton out of your sight.

15:48.440 --> 15:51.720
SURI CHOHAN: Understood, ma'am.

15:51.760 --> 15:53.600
[music playing]

15:56.200 --> 16:00.800
[car alarm]
- He went.

16:04.800 --> 16:05.400
OK.

16:11.400 --> 16:13.360
[phone ringing]

16:13.400 --> 16:15.640
Eve, I'm in Hong Kong.

16:15.680 --> 16:19.080
MIS is thinking you
murdered Han Wai.

16:19.120 --> 16:20.160
Why are you here?

16:20.200 --> 16:21.120
We need to talk.

16:21.160 --> 16:23.040
Harry, you can't be here.

16:23.080 --> 16:24.240
It's too dangerous.

16:24.280 --> 16:25.360
Get on a plane.

16:25.400 --> 16:26.000
Leave.

16:40.200 --> 16:42.560
SURI CHOHAN: So, what happened
to you last night, Harry?

16:42.600 --> 16:45.560
HARRY CLAYTON: Oh you
know, this and that.

16:45.600 --> 16:49.320
DETECTIVE SHAOLIN:
We've got something.

16:49.360 --> 16:50.680
[chatter]

16:50.720 --> 16:53.120
30 minutes ago, a call
came in on the phone number

16:53.160 --> 16:53.800
Lenny Kwan gave us.

16:53.840 --> 16:56.440
[non-english speech]

16:56.480 --> 16:58.160
He says the woman
in the picture

16:58.200 --> 17:01.160
has been seen every day at the
Tigerman Tea House in Wan Chai.

17:01.200 --> 17:03.440
She's asking questions
about Tin Hau Enterprises.

17:03.480 --> 17:05.600
So the Torches
know where Eve is.

17:05.640 --> 17:06.440
[non-english speech]

17:06.480 --> 17:07.520
She says thank you.

17:07.560 --> 17:09.560
We'll find her there.

17:09.600 --> 17:11.560
[music playing]

17:17.600 --> 17:19.080
We expecting trouble?

17:29.800 --> 17:31.240
DETECTIVE SHAOLIN:
The Tea House is here

17:31.280 --> 17:32.720
at the end of the boardwalk.

17:32.760 --> 17:35.560
SURI CHOHAN: OK, Detective
To, you come with me inside.

17:35.600 --> 17:37.040
Steve, Harry, you
take the boardwalk.

17:37.080 --> 17:38.800
[inaudible],,
even Grey knows it.

17:38.840 --> 17:40.640
I'm the only one that can
get close to Alexandri.

17:40.680 --> 17:43.360
If she's sees you,
she's going to bolt.

17:43.400 --> 17:46.000
You're not going to
make me regret this.

17:46.040 --> 17:47.360
It's me.

17:47.400 --> 17:49.560
That's exactly what
I'm worried about, Harry.

17:49.600 --> 17:50.400
[sigh]

17:50.440 --> 17:51.680
OK.

17:51.720 --> 17:53.080
Go.
go.

18:51.600 --> 18:56.280
Harry Clayton, I've
been expecting you.

18:56.320 --> 18:57.600
Are you going to
introduce yourself

18:57.640 --> 18:58.760
before I arrest you, big man?

18:58.800 --> 19:00.480
Oh, I don't know.

19:00.520 --> 19:03.560
Why spoil all the fun?

19:28.400 --> 19:30.600
Someone tried to take
this from me before.

19:30.640 --> 19:32.600
It ended badly.

19:41.560 --> 19:47.440
[grunt]

19:47.480 --> 19:50.040
DETECTIVE SHAOLIN: His name is
Samuel Blake, dual nationality

19:50.080 --> 19:52.680
passport, English, Chinese.

19:52.720 --> 19:54.040
He comes and goes.

19:54.080 --> 19:56.480
But when he is here,
he brings trouble.

19:56.520 --> 19:58.040
What kind of trouble?

19:58.080 --> 20:01.600
We think he has connections
with the Wu Chi triads,

20:01.640 --> 20:04.640
otherwise known as
the Snake Hands.

20:04.680 --> 20:07.360
But he moves way too quickly and
too quietly to be pinned down.

20:07.400 --> 20:09.800
He wasn't moving too
quietly at the Tea house.

20:09.840 --> 20:11.040
Excuse me for a moment.

20:14.400 --> 20:16.680
[chatter]

20:16.720 --> 20:19.560
I spoke to DSI
Grey last night.

20:19.600 --> 20:22.200
She said that forensics could
only place one other person

20:22.240 --> 20:24.760
at Han Wai's murder.

20:24.800 --> 20:26.560
That was you.

20:26.600 --> 20:29.800
Oh what, so you think that
I'm Eve's accomplice now, huh?

20:29.840 --> 20:31.680
I'm not sure I know
who you are anymore.

20:31.720 --> 20:34.160
Why is DSI Grey
only talking to you?

20:34.200 --> 20:35.760
- Because she trusts me.
- Oh, my arse.

20:35.800 --> 20:37.360
She's using you to
get at me, Suri.

20:37.400 --> 20:38.080
[phone vibrating]

20:38.120 --> 20:39.240
DI Chohan.

20:39.280 --> 20:40.800
Oh look, speak of the devil.
Go on.

20:40.840 --> 20:43.480
[phone ringing]

20:43.520 --> 20:45.560
DSI GREY: DI Chohan,
are you alone?

20:45.600 --> 20:47.520
Yes, ma'am.

20:47.560 --> 20:48.360
Good.

20:48.400 --> 20:50.440
What about you, Steve?

20:50.480 --> 20:52.640
You think I'm a suspect?

20:52.680 --> 20:55.000
Well, I think Suri is
handling a very difficult

20:55.040 --> 20:56.360
situation as best she can.

20:56.400 --> 20:59.400
You didn't answer
the question.

20:59.440 --> 21:01.680
I think you're
a good cop, Harry.

21:01.720 --> 21:03.160
It doesn't mean you
haven't lost your way.

21:06.080 --> 21:07.800
Oh.

21:07.840 --> 21:10.160
Jesus, that big bastard
at the tea house

21:10.200 --> 21:11.160
cracked me good and proper.

21:11.200 --> 21:14.200
I'll be back in a minute.

Hi Rich, it's not
a very good time.

21:27.440 --> 21:28.800
You're telling me.

21:28.840 --> 21:29.760
The police are here.

21:29.800 --> 21:31.160
They're searching the flat.

21:31.200 --> 21:32.320
HARRY CLAYTON: Well, calm down.
Calm down.

21:32.360 --> 21:33.760
You've got nothing to hide.

21:33.800 --> 21:35.120
That's the thing.

21:35.160 --> 21:36.240
For once they're not
interested in me.

21:36.280 --> 21:37.160
- Hey.
- They're asking about you.

21:37.200 --> 21:38.360
Hey.

21:38.400 --> 21:39.560
They're saying you
murdered Isabella.

22:26.200 --> 22:27.280
Good.

22:27.320 --> 22:28.480
Then you'll
understand that I need

22:28.520 --> 22:29.600
you to arrest Harry Clayton.

22:33.280 --> 22:34.160
Yes.

22:34.200 --> 22:35.120
I understand.

DS ORWELL: Kitchen.

22:53.600 --> 22:55.080
His cut was bleeding.

22:55.120 --> 22:57.480
Harry shot Isabella Augustine.

22:57.520 --> 22:58.760
He killed her.

22:58.800 --> 23:00.160
What are you talking about?

23:00.200 --> 23:01.760
Detective Chohan,
I've been instructed

23:01.800 --> 23:05.600
to detain your colleague.

23:05.640 --> 23:06.600
SURI CHOHAN: Harry.

No!

23:28.480 --> 23:29.160
Get in.

23:29.200 --> 23:29.640
Suri.

23:33.400 --> 23:43.280
DETECTIVE SHAOLIN:
[non-english speech]

23:43.320 --> 23:44.760
[phone ringing]

23:44.800 --> 23:48.040
It suddenly seems like I'm
very much in demand today.

23:48.080 --> 23:49.360
SURI CHOHAN: Harry,
can you explain to me

23:49.400 --> 23:51.400
why I've just been
told to arrest you.

23:51.440 --> 23:53.440
I didn't kill
Isabella Augustine.

23:53.480 --> 23:55.000
Yes you did, Harry.

23:55.040 --> 23:57.640
I've got a video of you
shooting her in cold blood.

23:57.680 --> 23:58.320
No.

23:58.360 --> 23:59.760
Where?

23:59.800 --> 24:01.520
Suri, I didn't.

24:01.560 --> 24:02.520
Are you listening to me?

24:02.560 --> 24:03.720
Isabella killed herself.

24:03.760 --> 24:05.320
Someone must have
altered the footage.

24:05.360 --> 24:06.280
No, Harry.

24:06.320 --> 24:08.160
Someone is coming for me.

24:08.200 --> 24:10.040
You need to let me
find them first, Suri.

24:10.080 --> 24:11.240
You have to let me go.

24:11.280 --> 24:12.360
Don't do this.

24:12.400 --> 24:13.560
HARRY CLAYTON: Do what?

24:13.600 --> 24:15.000
Make me choose
between you and my job

24:15.040 --> 24:16.560
because you know
which way I'll go.

24:16.600 --> 24:18.440
Fine.

24:18.480 --> 24:19.560
Then you catch me if you can.

24:25.400 --> 24:28.280
[sigh]

24:28.320 --> 24:29.640
All right boss, call it.

24:29.680 --> 24:31.120
What are we doing?

24:31.160 --> 24:32.720
OK, we need a list of
every business interest

24:32.760 --> 24:34.680
the Torches had on
this side of the bay.

24:34.720 --> 24:37.480
We are not letting
him go, not like this.

24:45.480 --> 24:49.440
So Eve, let's start
with the headlines.

24:52.200 --> 24:56.000
I don't want to
be a Torch anymore.

24:56.040 --> 24:59.720
All I've caused is
anger and suffering.

24:59.760 --> 25:03.080
After Isabella died
I asked the light

25:03.120 --> 25:05.440
against darkness for help.

25:05.480 --> 25:07.320
When I asked them to
take her bracelet back,

25:07.360 --> 25:10.600
they sent Han Wai to
London to retrieve it.

25:10.640 --> 25:13.080
You know the rest.

25:13.120 --> 25:15.720
I came here to find them.

25:15.760 --> 25:20.000
So Han Wai's killer,
the lad, nasty bollocks

25:20.040 --> 25:20.720
at the tea house.

25:20.760 --> 25:21.480
Same man.

25:21.520 --> 25:23.400
[thud]

25:23.440 --> 25:27.280
I don't know who he is.

25:27.320 --> 25:29.000
HARRY CLAYTON: Samuel Blake.

25:29.040 --> 25:30.520
He framed you for
Han Wai's murder.

25:30.560 --> 25:32.000
Now he's done the same to me.

25:32.040 --> 25:32.800
But why?

25:32.840 --> 25:35.040
Why doesn't he just kill us?

25:35.080 --> 25:36.360
You maybe, yeah.

25:36.400 --> 25:39.560
But he didn't.

25:39.600 --> 25:41.160
I'm protected.

25:41.200 --> 25:42.600
He knows it.

25:42.640 --> 25:45.480
We just need to find the
Torches before he finds us.

25:45.520 --> 25:47.280
No, intel said the
Torches were coming

25:47.320 --> 25:48.640
for you at the Tea house.

25:48.680 --> 25:50.360
Then they must have known
you were compromised.

25:50.400 --> 25:52.000
Nope.
They were there.

25:59.360 --> 26:02.120
HARRY CLAYTON:
Hung Hom underpass.

26:02.160 --> 26:03.560
EVE: Look, we're here now.

26:16.320 --> 26:17.680
Is this it?

26:17.720 --> 26:18.640
[doors opening]

26:18.680 --> 26:19.520
Driver?

26:19.560 --> 26:23.000
[screaming and grunting]

26:24.040 --> 26:26.800
[boat motor]

26:26.840 --> 26:28.760
HARRY CLAYTON: Was
that really necessary?

26:28.800 --> 26:30.720
[music playing]

26:52.320 --> 26:56.280
[non-english speech]

26:56.320 --> 26:59.680

26:59.720 --> 27:01.240
[beeping]
- Fillings.

27:07.720 --> 27:09.640
[slot machine]

27:12.280 --> 27:18.640
[coins clinking]
[sigh]

27:18.680 --> 27:20.600
Damn machine's rigged.

27:25.120 --> 27:26.760
There you are.

27:26.800 --> 27:30.600
Eve Alexandri, last
of the Torches.

27:30.640 --> 27:34.360
Madam Chung, Dragonhead
of the Society of Torches.

27:34.400 --> 27:35.080
No.

27:35.120 --> 27:36.720
No bowing.

27:36.760 --> 27:40.680
You've had a difficult few days.

27:40.720 --> 27:47.680
And you, Harry Clayton, how
is that working out for you?

27:54.640 --> 27:56.160
[coin clinking]

27:56.200 --> 28:00.160
[slot machine]

28:00.200 --> 28:08.040
[coins clinking]

28:08.080 --> 28:12.560
The bracelets
have worn you thin.

28:12.600 --> 28:14.760
That is often the
way with those that

28:14.800 --> 28:17.200
carry them through dark times.

28:20.400 --> 28:25.360
So now you wish to give
them back, don't you?

28:25.400 --> 28:28.200
I didn't choose this life.

28:28.240 --> 28:32.800
HARRY CLAYTON: And I would
very much like mine back.

28:32.840 --> 28:38.160
And yet your business
is not complete with them.

28:38.200 --> 28:40.760
You are being hunted.

28:40.800 --> 28:42.560
His name's Samuel Blake.

28:42.600 --> 28:43.360
He wants the bracelet--

28:43.400 --> 28:45.120
I know who he is.

28:45.160 --> 28:48.520
And he does not
want the bracelets.

28:48.560 --> 28:55.440
He hunts them both because
he chooses to destroy them.

28:55.480 --> 28:59.360
Come, there is something
here you should see.

28:59.400 --> 29:03.240
[boat motor]

29:03.280 --> 29:04.600
Are you sure about this?

29:04.640 --> 29:07.040
You know Harry, the
feeling that however

29:07.080 --> 29:09.560
well you got to know him, you'd
never see the whole picture.

29:09.600 --> 29:11.000
Well, this is it.

29:11.040 --> 29:12.200
Yeah, I know we never
got the whole picture

29:12.240 --> 29:14.200
but I also know he's our friend.

29:14.240 --> 29:16.160
Are you absolutely sure?

29:16.200 --> 29:17.440
SURI CHOHAN: Yeah,
he's our friend Steve

29:17.480 --> 29:19.160
but I've just received
footage of him

29:19.200 --> 29:20.720
killing his ex-girlfriend.

29:20.760 --> 29:21.680
What am I supposed to believe?

29:40.480 --> 29:42.000
[burning]

29:43.040 --> 29:44.400
[chimes]

29:44.440 --> 29:46.800
MADAM CHUNG: You are in
the temple of the fortune.

29:56.240 --> 29:59.120
HARRY CLAYTON:
These are the tools.

29:59.160 --> 30:00.360
These made the bracelets?

30:00.400 --> 30:03.480
By the blacksmith
Lanfar in 733 AD.

30:06.640 --> 30:10.440
This is all we have
left of that time.

30:10.480 --> 30:14.480
The first bracelet was
a gift for the emperor.

30:14.520 --> 30:18.320
But it was forged in error.

30:18.360 --> 30:22.120
Simple mistake, an
extra line of young

30:22.160 --> 30:25.760
gave it the power
to control luck.

30:25.800 --> 30:29.560
We, his daughters,
saw his creation

30:29.600 --> 30:33.040
as a great gift
that gave mankind

30:33.080 --> 30:36.440
a way to steer its destiny.

30:36.480 --> 30:41.680
So we became the light
against the darkness.

30:41.720 --> 30:46.360
[non-english speech]

30:46.400 --> 30:50.440
But we have always
had our enemies.

30:50.480 --> 30:53.760
Some desired the
bracelets for themselves.

30:53.800 --> 30:59.600
Others, the worst of them,
saw our gift as a blight

30:59.640 --> 31:03.280
on humanity, the
corruption of the fates.

31:03.320 --> 31:04.760
[gunshot]
[groan]

31:04.800 --> 31:10.720
They became zealots, [splash]
men who would do anything

31:10.760 --> 31:14.080
to extinguish our light.

31:14.120 --> 31:18.520
And like Blake, [thuds] if
he is the man [gunshots]

31:18.560 --> 31:19.800
I fear him to be,
then he will know

31:19.840 --> 31:22.640
that before he can
destroy the bracelets,

31:22.680 --> 31:26.400
then first you have
to destroy you.

31:26.440 --> 31:28.360
He can try.

31:28.400 --> 31:30.560
Very well.

31:30.600 --> 31:34.800
I will take the
bracelets from you.

31:34.840 --> 31:36.120
Thank you.

31:36.160 --> 31:38.360
First, I must
chop off your heads.

31:38.400 --> 31:39.000
Right.

31:42.240 --> 31:43.040
Is there any other way?

31:43.080 --> 31:43.720
[slice]

31:43.760 --> 31:44.360
EVE: Fuck.

31:47.680 --> 31:49.560
It's a GPS tracer.

31:49.600 --> 31:52.280
What happened to you
in the Tea house?

31:52.320 --> 31:54.480
[thud]

31:54.520 --> 31:58.000
Blake, when he knocked me out.

31:58.040 --> 32:00.360
MADAM CHUNG: And now you
have led him straight to us.

32:07.000 --> 32:09.320
[non-english speech]

32:09.360 --> 32:10.360
MADAM CHUNG I don't run.

32:10.400 --> 32:14.520
[gunshots]

32:14.560 --> 32:16.160
Too slow.

32:16.200 --> 32:20.560
Little girl, do not twist
the ear of the dog that bites.

32:20.600 --> 32:21.600
SAMUEL BLAKE: Detective Clayton.

32:26.200 --> 32:28.160
I think it's time we had
another word, don't you?

32:28.200 --> 32:31.160
Two years ago, I was a pretty
good cop with a nasty gambling

32:31.200 --> 32:32.720
problem, which means
that I was probably

32:32.760 --> 32:36.240
the worst candidate on earth
to be given a lucky bracelet.

32:36.280 --> 32:38.320
Flash forward to this
afternoon, I've been

32:38.360 --> 32:39.800
framed for Isabella's murder.

32:39.840 --> 32:41.400
Oh, excellent work by the way,
I'm assuming that was you.

32:41.440 --> 32:43.040
Thank you.
I am rather proud of it.

32:43.080 --> 32:44.360
I've lost my
wife, my daughter,

32:44.400 --> 32:46.360
my job, my friends,
my whole life

32:46.400 --> 32:50.040
to this stupid bloody thing.

32:50.080 --> 32:51.680
Lucky me.

32:51.720 --> 32:56.480
So if you want this,
you're welcome to.

32:56.520 --> 32:58.160
But first you'll
have to strip it

32:58.200 --> 33:03.120
off my rotting Belfast carcass.

33:03.160 --> 33:04.280
I thought you'd never ask.

33:04.320 --> 33:06.080
Oh, come on.

33:06.120 --> 33:09.520
You and I both know it's
not going to be that easy.

33:09.560 --> 33:11.800
That's why we're going to
have to do things the hard way.

33:11.840 --> 33:12.760
[slice]
[screams]

33:12.800 --> 33:13.520
[gunshot]

33:13.560 --> 33:17.240
[breaking class]

33:17.280 --> 33:19.040
The taxi Clayton
escaped in was

33:19.080 --> 33:21.360
found dumped in Kowloon Park.

33:21.400 --> 33:24.440
Here's a list of Torch interests
on that side of the harbor,

33:24.480 --> 33:27.040
illegal gambling dens, bars.

33:27.080 --> 33:29.560
Most of them closed
down a long time ago.

33:29.600 --> 33:32.160
But these are unaccounted for.

33:32.200 --> 33:34.080
[beeps]

33:39.320 --> 33:40.400
Any casinos?

33:40.440 --> 33:42.160
No, we don't
have casino in Hong

33:42.200 --> 33:44.600
Kong, only gambling ships that
go into international waters.

33:44.640 --> 33:47.760
There's a ship right
there, the Joy Luck Palace.

33:47.800 --> 33:49.400
That's it.

33:49.440 --> 33:50.520
I think we found him.

33:54.080 --> 33:56.360
I've seen the
horror and the pain

33:56.400 --> 33:58.040
that these bracelets can cause.

33:58.080 --> 34:03.240
So I'm here to put you
out of your misery.

34:06.520 --> 34:08.000
Take a seat.

34:08.040 --> 34:09.320
[gasping]

34:12.200 --> 34:19.440
You see, what you don't know is,
right here, where these braces

34:19.480 --> 34:30.640
were forged, one extra line, and
all that's good in your world

34:30.680 --> 34:31.720
will turn against you.

34:36.280 --> 34:37.640
[scream]

34:37.680 --> 34:41.160

34:41.200 --> 34:43.560

34:43.600 --> 34:45.520

34:52.080 --> 34:54.000
Now let's see.

[gunshot]

34:57.400 --> 34:59.760
[bang]

34:59.800 --> 35:00.600
Harry!

35:00.640 --> 35:01.400
SAMUEL BLAKE: Oh dear.

35:15.520 --> 35:16.120
That's one.

35:21.120 --> 35:23.560
Now I just need yours.

35:23.600 --> 35:25.040
Be lucky, Harry.

35:28.480 --> 35:29.400

35:41.600 --> 35:42.560
DS ORWELL: Harry.

35:42.600 --> 35:44.160
Get him.

35:44.200 --> 35:46.160
[panting]

35:46.200 --> 35:47.560
EVE: Harry, get to the boat.

35:59.120 --> 36:00.680

36:00.720 --> 36:02.160
HARRY CLAYTON: Come on.
Let's go.

36:02.200 --> 36:05.080
MADAM CHUNG: We need
to get to Kai Tak Pier.

36:05.120 --> 36:07.240
My men will pick
us up from there.

36:07.280 --> 36:08.720
[gunshot]
[scream]

36:08.760 --> 36:10.680
HARRY CLAYTON: I wish people
would stop shooting at me.

36:14.200 --> 36:15.800
You good, Suri?

36:15.840 --> 36:17.480
Not exactly.

36:17.520 --> 36:19.280
HARRY CLAYTON: You and me both.

36:19.320 --> 36:23.280
Work trips are never as
much fun as you'd hoped.

36:23.320 --> 36:25.400
Don't run, Harry.

36:25.440 --> 36:27.800
I gotta run.

36:27.840 --> 36:29.360
[boat motor]
SURI CHOHAN: Shit.

36:34.360 --> 36:48.200

36:48.240 --> 36:49.440
HARRY CLAYTON: You OK?

36:49.480 --> 36:53.080
MADAM CHUNG: I'll be
better with a beer.

36:53.120 --> 36:55.000
Not far now, next pier.

37:00.400 --> 37:02.360
[boat horn]

37:02.400 --> 37:04.360
SURI CHOHAN: Harry!

37:04.400 --> 37:06.760
Any danger of us
going any faster?

37:06.800 --> 37:10.160
No, It's a bad boat.

37:10.200 --> 37:11.560
Great.

37:11.600 --> 37:16.520
[boat horn]

37:16.560 --> 37:21.080
SURI CHOHAN: Stop
the boat, Harry.

37:21.120 --> 37:23.080
HARRY CLAYTON:
Can't do that, Suri.

37:23.120 --> 37:26.480
Harry, Harry, no.
[boat horn]

37:26.520 --> 37:27.440
Come on.

37:27.480 --> 37:28.440
Come on.

37:28.480 --> 37:30.440
Come on.

37:30.480 --> 37:33.440
Harry, no!

37:33.480 --> 37:38.800
[screaming]

37:38.840 --> 37:41.360
[boat motor]

37:46.720 --> 37:47.360
Harry!

38:00.320 --> 38:01.560
[groaning]

38:01.600 --> 38:02.360
HARRY CLAYTON: Take
care of Madame Chung.

38:02.400 --> 38:03.200
Get her to safety.

38:03.240 --> 38:04.640
It's me they're after.

38:04.680 --> 38:07.240
MADAME CHUNG: This is your
world now, Harry Clayton.

38:07.280 --> 38:09.720
Blake is your shadow.

38:09.760 --> 38:12.760
You must take the second
bracelet from him before he

38:12.800 --> 38:16.120
wakes the shadow in you.

38:16.160 --> 38:20.000
Do this and I will relieve
you of your burden.

38:20.040 --> 38:21.160
Yes.

38:21.200 --> 38:22.400
Now go.
Go.

38:41.160 --> 38:42.640
SURI CHOHAN: I told
you not to run.

38:42.680 --> 38:45.760
Suri, listen to me.

38:45.800 --> 38:48.480
Harry Clayton, I'm
arresting you for murder.

38:51.280 --> 38:56.560
Just one question before I
go, how'd you know I'd be here?

38:56.600 --> 38:59.000
It's just you, isn't it?

38:59.040 --> 39:03.080
You've always been attracted
to the mad shiny ideas.

39:03.120 --> 39:04.760
Jesus, you know me too well.

39:04.800 --> 39:07.000
Yeah, I'm afraid so.

39:07.040 --> 39:10.680
So what does that tell you
about what I have to do now?

39:10.720 --> 39:12.360
- Harry, no.
- I'm sorry.

39:12.400 --> 39:15.760
It's the last mad
shiny idea I have left.

39:15.800 --> 39:17.600
Let me take you in.

39:17.640 --> 39:19.040
You can explain all of this.

39:19.080 --> 39:20.160
I tried.

39:20.200 --> 39:23.360
Try harder.

39:23.400 --> 39:26.560
We were pretty good
together, Suri, huh?

39:26.600 --> 39:28.600
We were bloody brilliant.

39:31.680 --> 39:32.600
Ah well.

39:37.640 --> 39:38.600
Harry!

39:38.640 --> 39:43.560
[splash] Harry, don't.

39:43.600 --> 39:45.520
[music playing]
Harry!

40:04.080 --> 40:05.400
[waves]

40:25.080 --> 40:27.360
The currents could have taken
his body out to sea by now.

40:27.400 --> 40:29.760
I'm sorry, Detective
Chohan but there's

40:29.800 --> 40:31.480
little chance we'll find him.

40:31.520 --> 40:33.160
And Eve Alexandri.

40:33.200 --> 40:37.200
She could have fled inland
or taken the boat somewhere.

40:37.240 --> 40:39.440
Hong Kong is an easy
place to run from.

40:39.480 --> 40:41.440
I wish I could have done more.

40:41.480 --> 40:43.000
No, no, you've
done everything.

40:43.040 --> 40:44.440
Thank you, Detective.

40:44.480 --> 40:48.000
Detective Chohan,
Detective Orwell.

40:52.480 --> 40:57.480
DS ORWELL: So, back
to London, Rich.

40:57.520 --> 40:59.120
Yeah, well that's
going to be--

40:59.160 --> 40:59.600
DS ORWELL: Yeah.

41:04.160 --> 41:08.760
You said we were missing
something about Harry.

41:08.800 --> 41:09.760
What is it?

41:09.800 --> 41:11.280
DS ORWELL: I don't know, ma'am.

41:11.320 --> 41:17.560
I think he sees a world
most people don't, a world

41:17.600 --> 41:18.440
that can swallow you up.

41:28.400 --> 41:31.360
[groaning]

41:31.400 --> 41:34.640
[non-english speech]

41:34.680 --> 41:37.120
She wants to know
if you want Opium.

41:37.160 --> 41:38.400
HARRY CLAYTON: No.
No.

41:38.440 --> 41:43.440
[non-english speech]

41:43.480 --> 41:49.360
[screaming]

41:49.400 --> 41:51.280
[panting]

42:03.600 --> 42:05.200
EVE: What now?

42:05.240 --> 42:11.720
Back to London, clear my
name, find Blake, get our lives

42:11.760 --> 42:15.160
back, get my family back.

42:15.200 --> 42:18.200
What if he finds us first?

42:18.240 --> 42:23.560
If he wants a war,
he can have one.

42:23.600 --> 42:25.520
[music playing]

42:50.800 --> 42:55.120
Be patient with your life
now, careful with your pride.

42:55.160 --> 42:59.040
Hold tight, this
could be a wild ride.

42:59.080 --> 43:01.680
It could be a late night.

43:01.720 --> 43:06.160
And who knows when
it ends our lives.

43:06.200 --> 43:08.560
It's the roll of that dice.

43:08.600 --> 43:10.520
It's a guessing game.

43:10.560 --> 43:12.480
Who is the underdog?

43:12.520 --> 43:15.320
And who's going to
be the lucky one?
