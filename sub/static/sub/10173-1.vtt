01:42.127 --> 01:45.129
"The onion must be chopped finely.

01:45.130 --> 01:49.107
"I suggest that you put a piece of
onion on the crown of your head

01:50.093 --> 01:55.055
"to avoid the annoying crying
that is caused by chopping it."

01:58.977 --> 02:03.272
The trouble with crying while
chopping onions isn't the crying.

02:03.273 --> 02:06.541
It's that sometimes you can't stop.

02:06.860 --> 02:08.443
Mother always said

02:08.445 --> 02:12.114
that I'm as sensitive to onions
as my great-aunt Tita was.

02:12.115 --> 02:15.200
She even cried inside
her mother's womb

02:15.201 --> 02:17.786
whenever my great-grandmother
chopped onions.

02:24.961 --> 02:28.422
Señor Juan! Señor Juan!

02:28.423 --> 02:31.191
Go get the midwife!

02:31.468 --> 02:33.093
There's not enough time.

02:33.094 --> 02:34.636
What's happening?

02:34.637 --> 02:36.988
The baby's coming.

02:37.640 --> 02:39.516
Too late!

02:39.517 --> 02:44.563
Nacha, the maid, said that Tita was
literally pushed into this world

02:44.564 --> 02:47.149
by a torrid stream of tears

02:47.150 --> 02:50.794
that overflowed from the
table to the kitchen floor.

03:00.497 --> 03:04.265
Another girl, Juan.

03:05.376 --> 03:07.336
When the fright was over

03:07.337 --> 03:10.672
and the water had evaporated,
thanks to the sun,

03:10.673 --> 03:13.217
Nacha swept up what
remained of the tears.

03:13.218 --> 03:16.011
With that salt, she
filled a 40-pound sack

03:16.012 --> 03:19.181
which they used for
cooking for a long time.

03:19.182 --> 03:20.682
It's a girl.

03:20.683 --> 03:22.684
What a little cutie she is.

03:22.685 --> 03:24.686
That means another drink, right?

03:24.687 --> 03:25.854
Here's to you.

03:25.855 --> 03:27.314
What's the matter with you?

03:27.315 --> 03:28.649
Can't you do it right?

03:28.650 --> 03:31.209
At this point, you've
got three daughters.

03:31.361 --> 03:34.003
When are you going to make a son?

03:34.114 --> 03:37.298
Well, it's not entirely his fault.

03:43.665 --> 03:45.974
Why do you say that?

03:49.045 --> 03:52.256
They say that your
second child, Gertrudis,

03:52.257 --> 03:56.025
isn't your daughter, but the
daughter of the mulatto.

04:11.568 --> 04:14.961
- Señora.
- Our condolences.

05:00.491 --> 05:03.535
Poor little innocent child.

05:03.536 --> 05:07.222
You've been left fatherless and without
milk from one day to the next.

05:07.290 --> 05:09.082
But don't you worry.

05:09.083 --> 05:13.645
My teas will make you
strong and pretty.

05:13.880 --> 05:17.466
The first man who sees you
will want to marry you.

05:17.467 --> 05:18.717
You'll see.

05:18.718 --> 05:21.595
Don't ever say that again, Nacha.

05:21.596 --> 05:23.639
Tita will never marry.

05:23.640 --> 05:25.682
Being my youngest daughter,

05:25.683 --> 05:28.743
she's destined to care
for me until I die.

05:29.520 --> 05:31.913
Feed the girls. They're hungry.

05:32.106 --> 05:34.691
Whatever you say, Señora Elena.

05:34.692 --> 05:38.195
Fed by Nacha, Tita
grew up in the kitchen

05:38.196 --> 05:40.489
amidst the smells of chicken soup,

05:40.490 --> 05:44.326
thyme, laurel, steamed milk,

05:44.327 --> 05:47.846
garlic, and, of course, onion.

06:58.693 --> 07:02.712
- Some more hot chocolate, señor?
- Thank you, no.

07:04.699 --> 07:06.742
Good evening, Don Pascual.

07:06.743 --> 07:08.843
Sit down, please.

07:13.416 --> 07:17.419
When Tita felt Pedro's burning
gaze upon her shoulders,

07:17.420 --> 07:21.423
she understood exactly
how raw dough must feel

07:21.424 --> 07:24.609
when it comes in contact
with boiling oil.

07:25.094 --> 07:27.929
The heat that invaded
her was so real

07:27.930 --> 07:29.931
that she feared that,
just like dough,

07:29.932 --> 07:32.184
bubbles would break out
all over her body,

07:32.185 --> 07:35.854
on her stomach, her
heart, her breasts.

07:35.855 --> 07:38.623
She lowered her eyes
and tried to escape.

07:57.210 --> 07:59.143
Señorita Tita,

07:59.462 --> 08:04.732
I'd like to take this opportunity to
say that I am deeply in love with you.

08:04.801 --> 08:09.304
I know this declaration of love
may seem hasty and out of place,

08:09.305 --> 08:12.307
but getting anywhere
near you is so difficult

08:12.308 --> 08:14.893
that I decided to tell you tonight.

08:14.894 --> 08:19.122
I only beg you to tell me if
I may hope for your love.

08:22.318 --> 08:24.836
I don't know what to say.

08:25.363 --> 08:26.947
Give me time to think.

08:26.948 --> 08:28.573
No, I can't.

08:28.574 --> 08:30.951
I need an answer right now.

08:30.952 --> 08:32.494
One doesn't think about love.

08:32.495 --> 08:35.246
Either one feels it or one doesn't.

08:35.248 --> 08:38.332
I'm a man of few, but firm, words.

08:38.333 --> 08:41.352
I swear you'll have
my love forever.

08:41.504 --> 08:45.189
What about you? Do you feel
the same way about me?

08:47.343 --> 08:49.402
Yes.

08:51.514 --> 08:53.489
Mommy?

08:53.558 --> 08:55.533
Yes?

08:55.852 --> 08:59.370
Pedro Muzquiz wants to talk to you.

09:02.316 --> 09:05.001
To talk about what?

09:06.446 --> 09:07.988
I don't know.

09:07.989 --> 09:12.117
Tell him if it's to ask for
your hand, he needn't bother.

09:12.118 --> 09:15.053
He'd be wasting his
time and mine, too.

09:15.288 --> 09:17.914
You know that as my
youngest daughter,

09:17.915 --> 09:21.559
you must look after me
until the day I die.

09:29.135 --> 09:31.219
That'll be all for today.

09:31.220 --> 09:33.054
But I think that's not fair.

09:33.055 --> 09:35.182
You don't think. And that's that!

09:35.183 --> 09:37.642
Never, for generations,

09:37.643 --> 09:40.661
has anyone in our family ever
questioned this tradition.

09:40.855 --> 09:43.831
My daughter won't be the first!

10:19.435 --> 10:20.769
Chencha, see who's there.

10:20.770 --> 10:23.162
Yes, Doña Elena.

10:24.732 --> 10:28.543
You didn't invite anyone for your
birthday without telling me?

10:29.320 --> 10:31.379
No, Mommy. I really don't know.

10:31.697 --> 10:33.532
It's Don Pascual Muzquiz
and his son, Pedro.

10:33.533 --> 10:36.134
They want to talk to you.

10:51.759 --> 10:53.677
For the reasons I've
just explained,

10:53.678 --> 10:56.821
Tita will definitely
not be able to.

11:04.272 --> 11:07.774
Of course, if you want
Pedro to get married,

11:07.775 --> 11:10.251
let me suggest my daughter Rosaura.

11:10.486 --> 11:13.154
She's only two years
older than Tita.

11:13.155 --> 11:16.841
She is amply prepared
and ready for marriage.

11:18.536 --> 11:20.428
- Please forgive me!
- Chencha!

11:22.790 --> 11:25.166
Girls! Girls!

11:25.167 --> 11:28.628
Really! How can your
mommy be so cruel?

11:28.629 --> 11:31.923
You can't just exchange
tacos for enchiladas!

11:31.924 --> 11:33.608
What did she say?

11:40.850 --> 11:44.076
Come and greet Don
Pascual and Pedro

11:44.353 --> 11:46.829
and we'll toast to
your sister's wedding.

11:47.523 --> 11:49.749
You'll let Tita marry Pedro?

11:50.109 --> 11:54.295
No. Pedro will marry Rosaura.

12:10.463 --> 12:12.297
Why did you do that?

12:12.298 --> 12:15.050
We looked ridiculous by accepting
your marriage to Rosaura.

12:15.051 --> 12:17.969
Where's the love you swore to Tita?

12:17.970 --> 12:20.597
- Don't you keep your word?
- Sure I do.

12:20.598 --> 12:24.392
But if you definitely couldn't
marry the woman you loved,

12:24.393 --> 12:29.314
and the only way to be near
her was to marry her sister,

12:29.315 --> 12:32.667
wouldn't you make the
same decision as I did?

12:40.368 --> 12:42.426
Eat, my child.

12:42.495 --> 12:45.304
Food will make it hurt less.

12:46.040 --> 12:49.892
Thank you, Nacha, but I'm
just not hungry now.

12:50.670 --> 12:53.546
Just take one bite of
the Christmas roll

12:53.547 --> 12:56.424
and I'll tell you what I heard.

12:56.425 --> 12:59.386
Don Pascual asked Pedro

12:59.387 --> 13:02.597
why he agreed to
marry without love,

13:02.598 --> 13:08.561
and young Pedro told his father
that he is marrying for love,

13:08.562 --> 13:12.498
a great big love for you.

13:12.942 --> 13:17.086
I can't eat. Thank you, Nacha.

13:17.446 --> 13:20.047
I want to be alone.

13:36.298 --> 13:40.109
That night, Tita found
it impossible to sleep.

13:40.177 --> 13:43.112
She couldn't understand
what she was feeling.

13:43.639 --> 13:48.409
It's too bad that black holes
hadn't been discovered yet.

13:48.519 --> 13:50.937
Because then she'd have understood

13:50.938 --> 13:54.399
that a black hole had
landed in her chest

13:54.400 --> 13:57.752
that allowed the infinitely
cold air to rush in.

13:58.362 --> 14:00.421
That night she cried and knitted,

14:00.573 --> 14:03.074
knitted and cried, until dawn,

14:03.075 --> 14:06.286
until she finished the quilt
and covered herself with it.

14:06.287 --> 14:08.429
But it didn't help.

14:08.497 --> 14:13.059
Neither that night, nor many other
nights could she conquer the cold.

14:15.463 --> 14:17.255
What are you doing here?

14:17.256 --> 14:18.923
I'm helping Nacha.

14:18.924 --> 14:22.443
You should have been at
your sister's engagement.

14:24.138 --> 14:25.638
I had a headache.

14:25.639 --> 14:27.515
You will not disobey me,

14:27.516 --> 14:30.951
nor ruin your sister's wedding
by playing the martyr.

14:32.480 --> 14:35.398
And since you're so
interested in helping Nacha,

14:35.399 --> 14:39.001
you'll be responsible for
the wedding banquet.

14:39.403 --> 14:41.754
And no sour face.

14:42.281 --> 14:45.424
And not a single tear. You hear me?

14:45.659 --> 14:47.760
Yes, Mommy.

14:55.669 --> 15:00.215
Doña Elena, I'll prepare the carriage
to deliver these invitations.

15:00.216 --> 15:01.899
Fine.

15:17.983 --> 15:19.275
I'm sorry, Pedro.

15:19.276 --> 15:21.335
Did I hurt you?

15:22.196 --> 15:26.199
Not as much as I hurt you.
Let me explain my intentions.

15:26.200 --> 15:28.117
I haven't asked for explanations.

15:28.118 --> 15:30.829
At least allow me a few words.

15:30.830 --> 15:33.681
I did once, and it was all lies.

15:33.749 --> 15:35.516
I won't listen to you anymore.

15:39.922 --> 15:42.173
One hundred and sixty-seven.

15:42.174 --> 15:43.983
We're just missing three.

15:52.268 --> 15:53.601
Isn't the cake ready?

15:53.602 --> 15:56.771
No, but everything else is.

15:56.772 --> 15:58.565
Hurry up.

15:58.566 --> 16:02.418
It's midnight. You should rest
a little before the ceremony.

16:02.778 --> 16:04.779
I'm going to bed. Good night.

16:04.780 --> 16:05.864
Good night.

16:05.865 --> 16:07.923
See you tomorrow,

16:08.075 --> 16:10.259
God willing.

16:11.287 --> 16:16.307
Now you can let your
tears flow, my child.

16:17.918 --> 16:22.062
Because tomorrow nobody
must see you cry.

16:22.172 --> 16:24.591
Especially not Rosaura.

16:27.887 --> 16:31.556
I'll finish up. You go on.

16:31.557 --> 16:33.641
No, I'll help you.

16:33.642 --> 16:36.494
We're almost done.

16:37.938 --> 16:41.582
Go to sleep, girl. I can manage.

16:43.027 --> 16:47.379
Only the pots know the boiling
points of their broths,

16:48.032 --> 16:52.243
but I can guess yours.

16:52.244 --> 16:55.413
And stop crying into the batter

16:55.414 --> 16:57.515
or you'll ruin it.

16:57.833 --> 16:59.892
Go.

17:33.577 --> 17:36.162
Poor Tita, watching her
sister marry her boyfriend!

17:36.163 --> 17:41.250
One day I happened to see, during
Mass, Pedro slipped Tita a love note.

17:41.251 --> 17:43.419
It was even perfumed!

17:43.420 --> 17:46.214
I saw them holding hands
in the town square.

17:46.215 --> 17:48.049
How happy they looked!

17:48.050 --> 17:49.884
They'll all live in the same house!

17:49.885 --> 17:52.653
If I were Elena,
I wouldn't allow it.

17:54.765 --> 17:58.450
Dearly beloved, Rosaura
and Pedro, I welcome you.

17:58.560 --> 18:01.813
You have come to this
place of worship

18:01.814 --> 18:05.082
on you own accord, to
marry one another.

18:13.742 --> 18:15.618
Don't I get a congratulatory hug?

18:15.619 --> 18:18.496
Yes, of course. I hope
you'll be very happy.

18:18.497 --> 18:22.834
I'm sure I will be, now that
I've got what I wanted,

18:22.835 --> 18:24.419
to be near you,

18:24.420 --> 18:27.354
the woman I truly love.

18:39.935 --> 18:41.519
What did Pedro tell you?

18:41.520 --> 18:42.770
Nothing, Mommy.

18:42.771 --> 18:44.313
Don't try to fool me.

18:44.314 --> 18:46.607
I've done everything
you're thinking of doing.

18:46.608 --> 18:49.585
So don't play innocent with me.

18:50.487 --> 18:53.881
And don't let me see
you near Pedro again!

19:02.249 --> 19:04.767
This is delicious.

19:07.129 --> 19:09.255
Some more, please.

19:09.256 --> 19:11.732
Congratulations, children.

19:12.509 --> 19:14.943
Cheers, Pedro!

19:15.679 --> 19:18.781
A toast! Cheers!

19:24.063 --> 19:25.954
Ah!

19:35.657 --> 19:37.992
Yes, thank you.

19:37.993 --> 19:40.010
Thank you.

20:24.581 --> 20:28.767
Weeping was the first symptom
of a strange intoxication.

20:28.836 --> 20:33.172
A sense of melancholy and frustration
overtook all the guests,

20:33.173 --> 20:37.385
making them take refuge on the
patio, in the barns and bathrooms

20:37.386 --> 20:40.154
as they yearned for "the
love of their lives."

21:09.418 --> 21:12.170
Nobody escaped the spell.

21:12.171 --> 21:15.189
Several lucky ones reached
the bathrooms in time.

21:15.424 --> 21:19.051
The rest took part in the
collective vomiting spree

21:19.052 --> 21:22.029
that took place by the river.

21:44.745 --> 21:46.412
Mommy, Nacha.

21:46.413 --> 21:49.957
- What emetic did you put in that cake?
- Emetic?

21:49.958 --> 21:53.920
You and Nacha will regret
ruining your sister's wedding!

21:53.921 --> 21:55.521
Nacha is dead!

22:34.670 --> 22:38.814
I think it's best to wait a while

22:39.675 --> 22:43.110
until the intoxication
wears off, don't you?

24:02.924 --> 24:04.967
- Pedro.
- Yes?

24:04.968 --> 24:08.429
It's been three months
since the wedding.

24:08.430 --> 24:11.531
I'm feeling perfectly fine now.

24:16.313 --> 24:17.913
Yes.

24:21.276 --> 24:25.295
Lord, it's not vice, nor lust,

24:25.364 --> 24:27.756
but to produce a son to serve you.

24:28.533 --> 24:32.511
Our Father, who art in Heaven,
hallowed by thy name...

24:43.131 --> 24:46.900
Tita, I told Mother I
want to cook today.

24:47.844 --> 24:51.138
You've never cooked before.
Should I help you?

24:51.139 --> 24:53.699
No, I want to do it myself.

25:31.346 --> 25:35.391
It's Rosaura's first cooking
effort. I think it's not bad.

25:35.392 --> 25:37.617
What do you think, Pedro?

25:38.353 --> 25:41.997
For the first time,
it's not that bad.

25:46.445 --> 25:49.363
Hurry, Chencha. I need
the bathroom again.

25:49.364 --> 25:51.282
Who told Rosaura she can cook?

25:51.283 --> 25:53.800
She gave us all the runs.

26:07.632 --> 26:11.260
Don't do that, girl. They're
like the devil himself.

26:11.261 --> 26:14.529
They say one look from
them and you're pregnant!

26:22.063 --> 26:25.774
Tita, today is your first anniversary
as the ranch's head cook.

26:25.775 --> 26:28.919
So I took the liberty of
bringing you these roses.

26:41.041 --> 26:43.141
Throw them out!

26:48.757 --> 26:51.425
Don't throw them out, my child.

26:51.426 --> 26:57.280
You can use them to make
quails in rose petal sauce.

28:47.792 --> 28:51.019
This is the nectar of the gods!

28:53.965 --> 28:56.149
It's much too salty.

28:57.135 --> 29:00.570
Excuse me. I don't feel well.

29:17.530 --> 29:21.116
A strange alchemical phenomenon
seemed to have occurred.

29:21.117 --> 29:23.285
Not only Tita's blood,

29:23.286 --> 29:27.806
but her whole being had
dissolved into the rose sauce,

29:27.999 --> 29:30.542
into the quails,

29:30.543 --> 29:33.436
and into every aroma of the meal.

29:33.505 --> 29:36.423
That's how she invaded
Pedro's body.

29:36.424 --> 29:42.237
Voluptuously, ardently
fragrant, and utterly sensual.

29:44.974 --> 29:48.644
They had discovered a new
way of communicating.

29:48.645 --> 29:50.896
Tita was the sender

29:50.897 --> 29:53.273
and Pedro the recipient.

29:53.274 --> 29:54.858
Gertrudis was the lucky one

29:54.859 --> 30:00.547
within whom this sexual encounter
was synthesized through the meal.

30:43.158 --> 30:48.428
The rose smell that Gertrudis
emitted traveled ever so far.

30:57.505 --> 31:02.217
This fragrance caused the Villista
chief to seek out something unknown

31:02.218 --> 31:04.819
at an unspecified place.

31:26.910 --> 31:31.679
It wasn't difficult to
realize that horse and rider

31:31.915 --> 31:34.682
seemed to be obeying
superior orders.

31:42.050 --> 31:43.691
Tita!

31:44.469 --> 31:47.153
Tita, what's happening out here?

31:47.931 --> 31:51.016
The Federales came and set
the bathroom on fire.

31:51.017 --> 31:52.643
Where is Gertrudis?

31:52.644 --> 31:55.245
They kidnapped her.

32:08.326 --> 32:12.037
Mama Elena believed the whole
story and became quite ill.

32:12.038 --> 32:14.998
But she almost died when
Father Ignacio told her

32:14.999 --> 32:20.963
that he had heard that Gertrudis
worked in a brothel near the border.

32:20.964 --> 32:22.814
Not a holy house.

32:30.849 --> 32:34.393
She forbade any mention
of her daughter's name

32:34.394 --> 32:37.954
and had her photos and
birth certificate burned.

32:44.279 --> 32:46.780
Today we ate this dish

32:46.781 --> 32:49.424
and Gertrudis ran away.

33:40.084 --> 33:43.102
My Gertrudis!

33:54.015 --> 33:55.615
Tita!

33:55.850 --> 33:58.451
Where the devil are you?

34:03.858 --> 34:05.233
Your sister's there?

34:05.234 --> 34:07.945
Yes, and it's none
of your business.

34:07.946 --> 34:10.547
Give it to her and come right back!

34:10.989 --> 34:13.675
- Tita!
- I don't want my mother to find out.

34:15.203 --> 34:17.411
Where were you?

34:17.413 --> 34:19.973
In the bathroom, Mommy.

34:21.042 --> 34:23.126
You're in charge of
the ranch today.

34:23.127 --> 34:27.981
Chencha is coming with me to Eagle
Pass to shop for your sister's baby.

34:28.174 --> 34:29.774
Very well.

34:39.060 --> 34:41.828
Tita! Tita!

34:42.146 --> 34:44.898
Tita, the baby is coming.

34:44.899 --> 34:47.275
I'll go get Dr. Brown.

34:47.275 --> 34:49.110
Please watch over
Rosaura until I'm back.

34:49.112 --> 34:52.213
Hurry back. I have lots of work.

34:56.202 --> 34:58.078
Nacha, help me, please!

35:41.289 --> 35:44.974
I'm really amazed at the
way Tita handled it.

35:45.209 --> 35:47.461
Rosaura was near death.

35:47.462 --> 35:49.937
Speaking of my daughter, doctor,

35:50.298 --> 35:53.441
shouldn't you come
visit her every day?

35:53.509 --> 35:58.488
Yes, I think that would be best,
given her delicate condition.

36:10.151 --> 36:12.194
Preparing the mole,

36:12.195 --> 36:17.240
Tita knew how contact with
fire alters elements.

36:17.241 --> 36:20.869
How dough becomes a tortilla

36:20.870 --> 36:24.831
and that a breast
untouched by love's fire

36:24.832 --> 36:29.560
just isn't a breast, but
a useless ball of dough.

36:29.837 --> 36:34.174
In one instant, Pedro had
transformed Tita's breasts

36:34.175 --> 36:36.176
from chaste to voluptuous

36:36.177 --> 36:38.470
without even touching them.

36:38.471 --> 36:43.850
Miss Tita, a stray bullet hit
Roberto's wet nurse on the head

36:43.851 --> 36:46.311
when she was coming here.

36:46.312 --> 36:48.204
She's dead.

36:51.526 --> 36:56.087
Tita never could resist helping
anyone who cried out for food.

36:56.447 --> 37:00.299
She immediately felt the
need to relieve that hunger.

37:00.368 --> 37:04.595
That feeling enabled her virgin
breast to nurse her nephew.

37:18.719 --> 37:21.596
Tita, what happened with the baby?

37:21.597 --> 37:23.014
Did he eat?

37:23.015 --> 37:25.725
Yes, Mom. He drank his
tea and fell asleep.

37:25.726 --> 37:27.660
Thank God!

37:28.437 --> 37:32.373
Pedro, what are you waiting for?
Take the baby to your wife.

37:32.900 --> 37:36.043
Children should be
with their mothers.

38:01.554 --> 38:02.971
My, my...

38:02.972 --> 38:07.100
The boy looks wonderful next
to such a beautiful aunt.

38:07.101 --> 38:10.103
- Thank you, doctor.
- He's not even your child.

38:10.104 --> 38:12.606
I'm picturing how
lovely you'll look

38:12.607 --> 38:15.859
when you carry your own child.

38:18.946 --> 38:21.489
Forgive me. Did I say
something wrong?

38:21.490 --> 38:26.161
No, it's just that I can't
marry or have children

38:26.162 --> 38:28.413
because I must care for
my mother until she dies.

38:28.414 --> 38:31.166
What? That's ridiculous!

38:31.167 --> 38:34.252
But that's how it is.

38:34.253 --> 38:37.897
Excuse me. I must
attend to the guests.

38:43.679 --> 38:47.615
Tita, the mole is superb!

38:47.683 --> 38:49.184
Do give me the recipe.

38:49.185 --> 38:50.810
Of course.

38:50.811 --> 38:56.040
The secret is that when you cook
it, you do it with much love.

38:58.611 --> 39:01.295
She thinks I'm dumb.

39:01.739 --> 39:06.660
I worry that someday Rosaura
might need a doctor

39:06.661 --> 39:08.578
and we'll be unable to get one.

39:08.579 --> 39:12.415
I think, once she
regains her strength,

39:12.416 --> 39:16.044
she should move with her husband
and child to San Antonio, Texas,

39:16.045 --> 39:17.545
with my cousin.

39:17.546 --> 39:19.339
There she'll get the
best medical attention.

39:19.340 --> 39:21.258
I don't agree, Doña Elena.

39:21.259 --> 39:24.010
During this political situation,

39:24.011 --> 39:27.013
you need a man at
home to protect you.

39:27.014 --> 39:29.849
I've never needed one.

39:29.850 --> 39:32.769
I've managed the ranch and
my daughters by myself.

39:32.770 --> 39:37.774
Besides, men are not that
important for living, Father.

39:37.775 --> 39:41.778
Nor is the revolution as
dangerous as they claim.

39:41.779 --> 39:44.364
It's worse to have chilies
without any water around.

39:45.533 --> 39:47.842
Doña Elena! Always so witty!

40:00.548 --> 40:02.815
- Pedro?
- Yes.

40:03.009 --> 40:04.467
Pedro...

40:04.468 --> 40:06.803
You'd better stay away
while I feed the baby.

40:06.804 --> 40:10.197
Mother suspects and she'll
have you move away.

40:10.224 --> 40:11.349
Mmm-hmm.

40:11.350 --> 40:14.894
Let's not give her more
cause. Please, go.

40:14.895 --> 40:16.537
Tita!

40:41.130 --> 40:43.590
I could never cut
watermelon like your mama.

40:43.591 --> 40:46.926
Don't worry. Nobody
besides her can do it.

40:46.927 --> 40:49.262
When it comes to
breaking things up,

40:49.263 --> 40:51.431
your mama's the master.

40:51.432 --> 40:52.599
Really!

40:52.600 --> 40:56.269
Stop babbling. Come, let's bring
her the ice before she yells.

40:56.270 --> 40:57.896
Where's the ice?

42:00.000 --> 42:01.767
Tita!

42:07.883 --> 42:10.109
Tita! Where were you?

42:11.011 --> 42:13.279
In the bathroom, Mommy.

42:25.985 --> 42:27.585
Hup!

42:52.344 --> 42:54.403
Ay, Tita!

42:54.889 --> 42:57.531
The water's too hot!

42:57.600 --> 43:01.452
You haven't learned anything
in all these years!

43:11.238 --> 43:13.214
Give it to me!

43:32.968 --> 43:37.238
The towel! You want me
to wrinkle up in here?

43:58.035 --> 44:00.010
Where's the slip?

44:04.333 --> 44:05.667
I burned it, Mommy.

44:05.668 --> 44:08.769
What are you thinking of,
you stupid little girl?

44:09.255 --> 44:11.172
Save the tears for when I die.

44:11.173 --> 44:14.859
Hand me the dirty one
or I'll catch cold.

44:20.307 --> 44:22.141
You opened the door too wide.

44:22.142 --> 44:24.910
- Do you want me to die of pneumonia?
- No.

44:27.523 --> 44:29.315
You're pulling my hair!

44:32.027 --> 44:35.671
Leave me alone! Go to the
kitchen and finish the chorizo.

44:47.167 --> 44:51.604
Why are you crying?
I hate to see you cry.

44:52.047 --> 44:53.590
What's wrong?

44:53.591 --> 44:57.276
Nicolas came back from San Antonio

44:58.220 --> 45:00.988
and said he passed away.

45:01.390 --> 45:04.642
What? Who died?

45:04.643 --> 45:07.812
- The boy!
- What boy?

45:07.813 --> 45:11.123
Your grandson.

45:11.442 --> 45:14.710
Everything he ate made him sick.

45:14.862 --> 45:17.963
So he died.

45:18.991 --> 45:21.217
Sit and keep working!

45:21.285 --> 45:23.036
I don't want tears.

45:26.582 --> 45:32.144
Poor child. I hope God
has him in Heaven.

45:33.922 --> 45:36.815
We can't let our sorrow take over.

45:36.925 --> 45:39.276
There's a lot of work.

45:40.679 --> 45:44.073
First finish this. Then
do whatever you want.

45:44.558 --> 45:47.310
But no crying. You hear me?

45:47.311 --> 45:49.995
That's what I think of your orders!

45:52.608 --> 45:56.794
I'm tired of always obeying you!

46:01.742 --> 46:04.343
Roberto's death is your fault!

46:18.509 --> 46:21.694
Have Nicolas remove the
ladder from the dovecote

46:21.762 --> 46:24.321
and keep it away until tomorrow.

46:37.194 --> 46:39.461
Tita, my child.

46:52.042 --> 46:54.059
Chencha!

47:00.509 --> 47:03.177
What's wrong? Why isn't
Tita coming down?

47:03.178 --> 47:05.388
She doesn't want to.
She's like crazy.

47:05.389 --> 47:08.224
Fine. Then let her go
to the crazy house.

47:08.225 --> 47:11.577
There's no room in my
house for lunatics!

47:19.945 --> 47:22.588
Tita, it's okay.

48:27.763 --> 48:29.822
I want to see my dad.

48:30.390 --> 48:33.992
Don't bother him now. Can't
you see he's with a patient?

48:36.396 --> 48:38.622
What's wrong with her?

48:39.733 --> 48:41.333
Shh, be quiet.

48:41.443 --> 48:42.944
Is she crazy?

48:42.945 --> 48:46.004
I'll tell you later.
Tell you later.

49:23.193 --> 49:28.589
I bought you this yarn.
I noticed you like to knit.

49:30.492 --> 49:33.719
Is the color all right,
or should I exchange it?

49:35.497 --> 49:37.915
You didn't like the food, right?

49:37.916 --> 49:40.100
I don't blame you.

49:40.294 --> 49:43.462
Our housekeeper, Sue
Ellen, is an awful cook,

49:43.463 --> 49:48.108
but my poor son and I
have to put up with it.

50:01.648 --> 50:04.708
Of course, you don't have to.

50:05.736 --> 50:08.962
I'll tell Sue Ellen that
you're not feeling well.

50:09.489 --> 50:11.449
So don't worry.

50:11.450 --> 50:13.050
Hmm?

50:18.332 --> 50:21.959
Tita, whose hands were now
free of her mother's orders,

50:21.960 --> 50:24.879
didn't know what to ask of them.

50:24.880 --> 50:28.565
They could do anything
or change into anything.

50:29.343 --> 50:33.596
If they could just turn
into birds and fly away!

50:33.597 --> 50:36.557
She'd like them to take
her far, far away.

50:36.558 --> 50:39.310
To fly away from herself.

50:39.311 --> 50:42.063
She didn't want to think
or make decisions.

50:42.064 --> 50:45.024
Above all, she never
wanted to speak again.

50:45.025 --> 50:48.418
She didn't want her words
to scream out her pain.

51:04.544 --> 51:07.213
In 1669,

51:07.214 --> 51:10.091
Brand, a chemist from Hamburg,

51:10.092 --> 51:14.987
while searching for the
"philosopher's stone", discovered...

51:16.098 --> 51:18.365
Phosphorus.

51:19.476 --> 51:23.562
My grandmother, Morning Star,

51:23.563 --> 51:26.649
who was a Kickapoo Indian,

51:26.650 --> 51:32.905
used to say that we're all born
with a box of matches inside.

51:32.906 --> 51:37.092
We can't light them by ourselves.

51:37.494 --> 51:40.413
Just like in this experiment,

51:40.414 --> 51:43.749
we need oxygen and the
help of a candle.

51:43.750 --> 51:46.419
Except that in our case,

51:46.420 --> 51:49.630
the oxygen has to
come, for example,

51:49.631 --> 51:51.674
from a lover's breath.

51:51.675 --> 51:55.469
The candle can be anything.

51:55.470 --> 51:59.031
A melody, a word,

51:59.725 --> 52:01.517
a caress,

52:01.518 --> 52:03.102
a sound.

52:03.103 --> 52:04.395
Just anything.

52:04.396 --> 52:07.106
Anything that pulls the trigger

52:07.107 --> 52:10.542
and sets off one of the matches.

52:11.153 --> 52:15.130
Every person has to discover

52:15.574 --> 52:18.534
what will pull his trigger
to enable him to live.

52:18.535 --> 52:24.973
Because it is the explosive
flare of a match

52:25.167 --> 52:29.102
that feeds our souls.

52:29.254 --> 52:32.048
If there's nothing to
trigger the explosion,

52:32.049 --> 52:34.733
our box of matches becomes damp

52:35.093 --> 52:39.738
and then we'll never be
able to light any of them.

52:42.642 --> 52:47.245
There are many ways to
dry a damp match box.

52:47.481 --> 52:51.249
You can rest assured
there is a cure.

52:51.318 --> 52:56.546
Of course, it's important to
light the matches one at a time.

52:56.656 --> 52:59.575
Because if an intense
burst of emotion

52:59.576 --> 53:03.595
were to ignite them all at once,

53:04.372 --> 53:08.000
they would produce such
a strong brilliance

53:08.001 --> 53:11.770
that before our eyes
there would appear

53:12.589 --> 53:14.173
a tunnel of such radiance

53:14.174 --> 53:17.635
showing us the path
we forgot at birth,

53:17.636 --> 53:23.990
the same path that calls us
back to our divine origins.

54:05.809 --> 54:08.519
"Broths can cure any
type of illness,

54:08.520 --> 54:10.604
"be it physical or mental."

54:10.605 --> 54:14.066
At least, that was Chencha's
opinion, and Tita's,

54:14.067 --> 54:17.361
although lately she hadn't
believed it strongly enough.

54:17.362 --> 54:20.406
Now she had to accept it as true.

54:20.407 --> 54:22.366
She herself had recovered

54:22.367 --> 54:26.036
after just one bowl of
this magic beef broth.

54:26.037 --> 54:28.013
John, please don't go!

54:31.459 --> 54:33.294
Child!

54:33.295 --> 54:36.255
And I imagined you tied
up with some crazies.

54:37.799 --> 54:41.218
Why not, considering the
mother that God gave you!

54:41.219 --> 54:43.554
I'm almost going crazy.

54:43.555 --> 54:46.724
She has nobody left to order
about, so I get it all!

54:46.725 --> 54:48.684
And she lectures me.

54:48.685 --> 54:51.979
She says disobedient
women who leave home

54:51.980 --> 54:55.874
"end up wallowing in the
filthy river of sin."

54:56.526 --> 54:59.878
I think she meant Gertrudis.

55:04.034 --> 55:05.492
Ah, Chencha...

55:05.493 --> 55:07.161
Thank you for coming.

55:07.162 --> 55:09.888
It's been so good to see you.

55:15.629 --> 55:18.396
I have a favor to ask.

55:19.925 --> 55:23.235
Tell my mother that you saw me,

55:23.637 --> 55:25.695
that I'm fine,

55:26.431 --> 55:29.407
and that I'll never
go back to the ranch.

55:40.820 --> 55:42.238
Ah!

55:42.239 --> 55:43.839
Thank you.

55:50.956 --> 55:56.726
Can you guess what I'm thinking?

56:01.800 --> 56:04.276
Will you marry me?

56:13.728 --> 56:15.437
Yes.

56:15.438 --> 56:17.539
I will.

56:19.401 --> 56:21.543
Chencha!

56:24.281 --> 56:27.924
Come, look at this.

56:38.378 --> 56:40.212
What do you want here?

56:43.300 --> 56:47.219
No, let me go! Mama Elena!

56:47.220 --> 56:49.070
Mama Elena!

56:57.188 --> 57:00.874
Let me go! Let me go!

57:22.922 --> 57:25.148
May I have this dance?

57:34.934 --> 57:37.978
Doctor, something very serious
has happened at the ranch.

57:37.979 --> 57:41.247
I'll take care of it. Let's go.

58:27.654 --> 58:30.364
Come out of there, you devil!

58:30.365 --> 58:33.049
You've no right to
steal my belongings.

58:37.372 --> 58:39.748
When she realized her
mother's secret,

58:39.749 --> 58:41.667
Tita cried.

58:41.668 --> 58:44.420
Not for the woman who
had repressed her,

58:44.421 --> 58:48.732
but for someone who'd been
frustrated by love, like herself.

58:53.221 --> 58:55.013
Be kind to her. Okay?

58:55.014 --> 58:56.614
Mmm.

59:49.152 --> 59:51.737
- It's a girl!
- Is she okay?

59:51.738 --> 59:54.573
Yes, considering how
premature she was.

59:54.574 --> 59:57.868
But, unfortunately, she'll
need a lot of care.

59:57.869 --> 59:59.803
And Rosaura?

01:00:00.455 --> 01:00:03.556
The birth was very
complicated, Pedro.

01:00:03.917 --> 01:00:06.309
I had to operate

01:00:07.086 --> 01:00:10.355
and she won't be able to
bear any more children.

01:00:10.423 --> 01:00:11.924
I'm sorry.

01:00:11.925 --> 01:00:14.067
Is she all right?

01:00:14.260 --> 01:00:18.154
Her condition is delicate. She won't
be able to tend to the child.

01:00:45.625 --> 01:00:49.477
We're thinking of
naming her after you.

01:00:49.629 --> 01:00:53.356
It's strange that, like you,
she was born out of grief

01:00:53.424 --> 01:00:57.819
and will have to live in the
kitchen and drink teas.

01:00:57.971 --> 01:01:00.973
And since she'll be
my only daughter...

01:01:00.974 --> 01:01:03.449
I don't like the idea.

01:01:03.601 --> 01:01:06.077
Give her a different name.

01:01:06.980 --> 01:01:10.373
How about Esperanza?

01:01:10.650 --> 01:01:12.067
Hmm...

01:01:12.068 --> 01:01:14.252
I don't know.

01:01:14.612 --> 01:01:18.156
Tita, why does she cry
when she's with me?

01:01:18.157 --> 01:01:21.243
- She doesn't seem to love me.
- Shh. That's not it.

01:01:21.244 --> 01:01:24.079
She misses the warmth and
smell of the kitchen.

01:01:24.080 --> 01:01:26.999
But I want her to be with me.

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:29.459
To keep the child near Rosaura,

01:01:29.460 --> 01:01:32.212
the child had to feel

01:01:32.213 --> 01:01:35.315
she was in the kitchen
with her Aunt Tita.

01:01:37.343 --> 01:01:40.137
Daddy, I want to
marry this little girl.

01:01:41.389 --> 01:01:43.740
Just like you and Tita.

01:01:43.766 --> 01:01:46.435
Not yet. You're too young.

01:01:46.436 --> 01:01:47.686
Not ever.

01:01:47.687 --> 01:01:50.188
This little girl will
have to take care of me.

01:01:50.189 --> 01:01:52.207
She won't marry.

01:01:54.027 --> 01:01:55.569
Is that true?

01:02:04.287 --> 01:02:08.457
Tita was so angry with
Rosaura's plans for Esperanza

01:02:08.458 --> 01:02:10.459
that she wished her sister

01:02:10.460 --> 01:02:14.171
had never allowed those disgusting,
repulsive, and revolting words

01:02:14.172 --> 01:02:16.439
to escape from her mouth.

01:02:16.591 --> 01:02:18.383
Tita wished she'd swallowed them

01:02:18.384 --> 01:02:21.986
and kept them inside until the
rot and worms ate them up.

01:02:34.108 --> 01:02:35.859
Thank you, love.

01:02:35.860 --> 01:02:38.044
You're welcome.

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:54.211
As you already know, the
purpose of this visit

01:02:54.212 --> 01:02:56.546
is to ask for Tita's hand.

01:02:56.547 --> 01:02:59.049
When will you be getting married?

01:02:59.050 --> 01:03:00.759
As soon as possible.

01:03:00.760 --> 01:03:03.987
I don't see any problem with that.

01:03:04.263 --> 01:03:06.598
You have our blessing.

01:03:06.599 --> 01:03:08.266
Let's set the wedding date.

01:03:08.267 --> 01:03:12.437
Well, I think this is the time

01:03:12.438 --> 01:03:15.707
when I'm supposed to give you this.

01:03:22.990 --> 01:03:25.049
To the happy couple!

01:03:46.305 --> 01:03:48.640
Take care of yourself. Hmm?

01:03:48.641 --> 01:03:51.435
I won't be gone long.

01:03:51.436 --> 01:03:53.703
I promise.

01:04:01.320 --> 01:04:02.920
Bye, now!

01:04:08.828 --> 01:04:10.328
I'm almost done.

01:04:10.329 --> 01:04:12.873
We're almost done for today.

01:04:18.713 --> 01:04:20.213
See you tomorrow.

01:04:20.214 --> 01:04:23.399
See you tomorrow. And
thanks for everything.

01:04:37.356 --> 01:04:40.208
Pedro! What are you doing here?

01:05:01.380 --> 01:05:03.715
- Tita! Come here.
- Tita isn't here.

01:05:03.716 --> 01:05:05.983
- She's washing dishes.
- Come! Look!

01:05:08.012 --> 01:05:10.822
Holy mother of God in Heaven,

01:05:10.973 --> 01:05:15.227
take Doña Elena's soul, so she'll stop
walking in the shadows of purgatory.

01:05:15.228 --> 01:05:17.229
What do you mean, Chencha?

01:05:17.230 --> 01:05:22.333
Can't you see it's the
ghost of the dead woman?

01:05:22.527 --> 01:05:25.294
She's paying for something!

01:05:25.363 --> 01:05:28.114
I'll never go near
that place again!

01:05:28.115 --> 01:05:30.174
Me neither.

01:05:36.791 --> 01:05:40.393
Oil of cocoa is an
excellent lip moisturizer.

01:05:40.586 --> 01:05:43.338
Every winter, Tita's
lips were so chapped

01:05:43.339 --> 01:05:45.757
that if she wanted to smile,

01:05:45.758 --> 01:05:47.968
she had to use plenty of ointment.

01:05:47.969 --> 01:05:50.220
But today it had nothing
to do with smiling.

01:05:50.221 --> 01:05:54.907
The possibility of finding herself
pregnant was no laughing matter.

01:05:58.396 --> 01:06:00.438
I didn't hear you come in.

01:06:00.439 --> 01:06:04.584
I noticed. You're lost in thought.

01:06:04.652 --> 01:06:07.962
It's just that I miss Gertrudis.

01:06:08.114 --> 01:06:13.426
I bet she'd like to be with us
tonight, cutting this bread.

01:06:14.620 --> 01:06:16.220
Listen, Tita.

01:06:17.415 --> 01:06:19.348
I need your advice.

01:06:20.251 --> 01:06:22.268
About what?

01:06:22.837 --> 01:06:25.130
Well, first let me say

01:06:25.131 --> 01:06:27.799
I've been wanting to talk to you,

01:06:27.800 --> 01:06:30.343
but jealousy kept me from doing it.

01:06:30.344 --> 01:06:31.928
Now it's different.

01:06:31.929 --> 01:06:35.072
If you still loved Pedro, you
wouldn't be marrying John.

01:06:35.141 --> 01:06:37.200
So, well...

01:06:38.144 --> 01:06:41.120
You must help me win back Pedro.

01:06:41.439 --> 01:06:44.399
- Me?
- Only you can do it.

01:06:44.400 --> 01:06:49.321
Look, I think it's my
weight, my flatulence,

01:06:49.322 --> 01:06:52.157
and my bad breath that
keeps him away from me.

01:06:52.158 --> 01:06:54.075
What can I do?

01:06:54.076 --> 01:06:57.595
Put me on a special
diet, because this fat,

01:06:57.955 --> 01:07:02.141
Pedro won't even touch me.

01:07:02.251 --> 01:07:03.793
Don't cry.

01:07:03.794 --> 01:07:06.963
I'll give you a special diet.
You'll get so pretty.

01:07:06.964 --> 01:07:10.399
What about the gas
and the bad breath?

01:07:10.551 --> 01:07:12.010
Mint leaves for the breath.

01:07:12.011 --> 01:07:15.196
They can freshen the worst breath.

01:07:15.848 --> 01:07:19.617
I'll take you off those
foods that cause gas.

01:07:19.685 --> 01:07:23.246
Don't cry now, or you'll
have me crying, too.

01:07:23.356 --> 01:07:25.440
You're such a good sister!

01:07:25.441 --> 01:07:28.543
I'm so happy we're together again.

01:07:30.821 --> 01:07:33.506
I'll get some mint leaves.

01:07:43.626 --> 01:07:46.811
I told you many times
not to go near Pedro.

01:07:47.588 --> 01:07:48.797
Then, why?

01:07:48.798 --> 01:07:50.715
I tried, Mommy, but...

01:07:50.716 --> 01:07:52.467
No "buts"!

01:07:52.468 --> 01:07:55.278
There's no name for
what you've done!

01:07:55.346 --> 01:07:58.030
You forgot about morals,

01:07:58.224 --> 01:08:01.867
respect, and the rules of society!

01:08:02.061 --> 01:08:04.229
You're worthless.

01:08:04.230 --> 01:08:08.499
You don't even respect yourself.

01:08:08.609 --> 01:08:12.211
You've dragged my family
name through the mud

01:08:12.989 --> 01:08:15.548
from my ancestors

01:08:15.908 --> 01:08:19.510
down to that cursed
child in your womb!

01:08:19.662 --> 01:08:21.412
My child is not cursed!

01:08:21.413 --> 01:08:23.247
Yes, it is!

01:08:23.249 --> 01:08:25.349
I'm cursing it!

01:08:25.584 --> 01:08:27.335
It and you, cursed forever!

01:08:27.336 --> 01:08:29.353
No, please!

01:08:30.171 --> 01:08:31.631
Close that door.

01:08:31.631 --> 01:08:34.483
Can't you see how cold it is?

01:08:38.596 --> 01:08:41.365
You're so strange lately.

01:08:41.434 --> 01:08:43.743
What's wrong?

01:09:08.085 --> 01:09:10.060
Rosaura, what a pleasure!

01:09:13.631 --> 01:09:15.508
Those Lobo people are here.

01:09:15.509 --> 01:09:17.844
The others want to cut the bread.

01:09:17.845 --> 01:09:20.613
- We're coming.
- Pedro, can you help me?

01:09:24.769 --> 01:09:26.786
We'll talk later.

01:09:29.982 --> 01:09:32.358
Hello. What's happening?

01:09:32.359 --> 01:09:33.818
Nothing.

01:09:33.819 --> 01:09:35.694
Good evening, Father.

01:09:35.696 --> 01:09:37.404
Good evening, Doña Paquita.

01:09:37.406 --> 01:09:38.907
What a surprise!

01:09:38.908 --> 01:09:41.425
How are you doing?

01:09:45.206 --> 01:09:46.805
Delicious.

01:09:49.752 --> 01:09:52.420
The dog? What's wrong?

01:09:55.049 --> 01:09:57.775
The girl is about to faint!

01:10:01.180 --> 01:10:03.264
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

01:10:03.265 --> 01:10:06.059
The dog is so old, he
barks at anything.

01:10:06.060 --> 01:10:09.620
The devil's dog. It scared us.

01:10:13.776 --> 01:10:16.293
- Are you feeling better?
- Yes.

01:10:17.738 --> 01:10:20.198
You seem out of sorts.

01:10:20.199 --> 01:10:24.202
You've a strange look about you.
It's good I know you're a good girl,

01:10:24.203 --> 01:10:27.497
otherwise I'd think
you were pregnant.

01:10:27.498 --> 01:10:28.832
- Pregnant?
- Uh-huh.

01:10:28.833 --> 01:10:30.542
Only you would suspect that.

01:10:30.543 --> 01:10:33.378
- And what do my eyes have to do with it?
- Mmm!

01:10:33.379 --> 01:10:35.755
Just by seeing a woman's eyes,

01:10:35.756 --> 01:10:40.443
I can immediately tell
whether she's pregnant.

01:10:58.154 --> 01:11:00.738
I came to cut the bread and
have some hot chocolate.

01:11:00.739 --> 01:11:02.282
Welcome!

01:11:02.283 --> 01:11:06.578
Sergeant Trevino, take the men
around back to be looked after.

01:11:06.579 --> 01:11:08.637
Yes, General!

01:11:10.040 --> 01:11:11.958
Tita, meet my husband.

01:11:11.959 --> 01:11:13.585
Juan Alejandrez, at your service.

01:11:13.586 --> 01:11:15.253
Pleased to meet you.

01:11:15.254 --> 01:11:17.271
Please, come in.

01:12:15.272 --> 01:12:18.983
I don't know where she
got her sense of rhythm.

01:12:18.984 --> 01:12:21.194
Mama didn't like to dance

01:12:21.195 --> 01:12:24.088
and Dad was a bad dancer.

01:12:43.008 --> 01:12:45.760
You don't know how much
I missed this food,

01:12:45.761 --> 01:12:48.279
especially my cream fritters.

01:12:48.889 --> 01:12:51.015
Revolutions wouldn't be so bad

01:12:51.016 --> 01:12:54.535
if you could eat at home
every day with your family.

01:12:55.271 --> 01:12:57.522
When Juan and I found
each other again,

01:12:57.523 --> 01:13:00.191
he said he'd come
here looking for me.

01:13:00.192 --> 01:13:03.460
I got so nostalgic for your food.

01:13:06.031 --> 01:13:09.300
So, how soon will my
fritters be ready?

01:13:09.910 --> 01:13:11.452
I'm boring you, aren't I?

01:13:11.453 --> 01:13:15.472
Of course not, Gertrudis.
Why do you say that?

01:13:17.876 --> 01:13:19.961
It's your eyes.

01:13:19.962 --> 01:13:23.731
Your mind has been off
somewhere for a while.

01:13:24.133 --> 01:13:26.775
It's Pedro, right?

01:13:27.970 --> 01:13:29.178
Yes.

01:13:29.179 --> 01:13:32.807
If you still love
him, why marry John?

01:13:32.808 --> 01:13:35.075
I'm not marrying him.

01:13:35.436 --> 01:13:38.162
I can't do it, Gertrudis.

01:13:46.613 --> 01:13:50.841
I'll move this off the stove
and you can keep crying.

01:13:54.121 --> 01:13:56.513
Why can't you get married?

01:13:58.125 --> 01:14:00.684
Because I think I'm pregnant.

01:14:02.087 --> 01:14:04.647
Pedro's the father, of course?

01:14:05.257 --> 01:14:07.175
- Yes.
- Rosaura knows?

01:14:07.176 --> 01:14:09.635
Nobody knows.

01:14:09.636 --> 01:14:12.071
Not even Pedro.

01:14:13.223 --> 01:14:16.642
I don't know what'll happen
when Rosaura learns the truth.

01:14:17.770 --> 01:14:19.954
The truth!

01:14:21.940 --> 01:14:26.794
Listen, Tita, the real truth
is that there is no truth.

01:14:26.862 --> 01:14:28.837
It all depends.

01:14:29.114 --> 01:14:32.867
In your case, the truth could
be that Rosaura married Pedro

01:14:32.868 --> 01:14:36.178
without giving a damn that
you two loved each other.

01:14:36.330 --> 01:14:40.208
Yes, but she's the wife and not me.

01:14:40.209 --> 01:14:42.226
So what?

01:14:42.628 --> 01:14:45.963
Did that wedding change
how you and Pedro feel?

01:14:45.964 --> 01:14:47.048
No.

01:14:47.049 --> 01:14:49.024
Of course not!

01:14:50.302 --> 01:14:54.138
Your love is one of the
truest loves I know.

01:14:54.139 --> 01:14:58.393
And you both should admit that
truth to Rosaura and anyone else.

01:14:58.394 --> 01:15:00.577
Especially since Mother's dead.

01:15:00.896 --> 01:15:03.872
You think I should talk to Rosaura?

01:15:06.235 --> 01:15:09.112
While I tell you what to do,

01:15:09.113 --> 01:15:12.131
would you fix the syrup
for my fritters?

01:15:15.786 --> 01:15:20.097
It might be good if Pedro knew
you're carrying his child.

01:15:20.290 --> 01:15:24.168
Pedro, it's lucky you came by!

01:15:24.169 --> 01:15:26.295
My sister has something
to tell you.

01:15:26.296 --> 01:15:30.774
Go and talk outside while
I finish the syrup.

01:15:43.230 --> 01:15:45.122
Sergeant Trevino!

01:15:45.524 --> 01:15:47.275
At your service.

01:15:47.276 --> 01:15:49.318
Can you cook cream fritters?

01:15:49.319 --> 01:15:52.755
To be quite honest,

01:15:53.031 --> 01:15:57.535
no, but if you wish, I'll try.

01:15:57.536 --> 01:15:59.678
Yes, I wish.

01:16:00.164 --> 01:16:02.707
And remember, you've
never let me down.

01:16:02.708 --> 01:16:05.642
I hope this won't
be the first time.

01:16:06.920 --> 01:16:09.396
Why didn't you tell me?

01:16:11.300 --> 01:16:13.885
Because first I wanted
to make a decision.

01:16:13.886 --> 01:16:16.387
- Have you?
- No.

01:16:16.388 --> 01:16:19.348
Before you make a
decision, you should know

01:16:19.349 --> 01:16:24.187
that having a child with you is the
greatest joy I could hope for.

01:16:24.188 --> 01:16:26.772
And to enjoy it properly,

01:16:26.773 --> 01:16:29.875
we should go far,
far away from here.

01:16:30.944 --> 01:16:33.488
But we can't just
think of ourselves.

01:16:33.489 --> 01:16:36.657
There are also Rosaura
and Esperanza.

01:16:36.658 --> 01:16:39.176
What will happen to them?

01:17:06.688 --> 01:17:10.916
<i>Little star</i>

01:17:11.235 --> 01:17:12.944
<i>Of a distant</i>

01:17:12.945 --> 01:17:15.754
<i>Sky</i>

01:17:16.949 --> 01:17:21.202
<i>That sees my pain</i>

01:17:21.203 --> 01:17:26.473
<i>That knows my suffering</i>

01:17:26.875 --> 01:17:29.502
<i>Come down and tell me</i>

01:17:29.503 --> 01:17:35.065
<i>If you love me a lot</i>

01:17:36.260 --> 01:17:39.278
<i>Or just a little</i>

01:17:45.435 --> 01:17:48.245
See what you've caused?

01:17:49.147 --> 01:17:52.416
Pedro and you have no shame.

01:17:52.776 --> 01:17:55.653
If you don't want
blood in this house,

01:17:55.654 --> 01:18:00.549
go where you can't hurt
anyone before it's too late.

01:18:00.826 --> 01:18:03.369
You're the one who should leave.

01:18:03.370 --> 01:18:05.496
I'm tired of your tormenting me.

01:18:05.497 --> 01:18:07.540
Leave me alone once and for all.

01:18:07.541 --> 01:18:11.335
Not until you behave
like a proper woman.

01:18:11.336 --> 01:18:13.504
Until you're decent!

01:18:13.505 --> 01:18:18.317
What do you mean by "decent"?
How you behaved?

01:18:18.510 --> 01:18:19.885
Yes.

01:18:19.886 --> 01:18:22.263
Well, that's how I'm behaving.

01:18:22.264 --> 01:18:24.640
Didn't you have an
illegitimate daughter?

01:18:24.641 --> 01:18:26.934
You'll be damned for
talking this way.

01:18:26.935 --> 01:18:28.769
No more damned than you.

01:18:28.770 --> 01:18:32.982
Shut your mouth! Who
do you think you are?

01:18:32.983 --> 01:18:35.818
I believe in what I am.

01:18:35.819 --> 01:18:40.297
A person who has the right
to live as she pleases.

01:18:41.158 --> 01:18:42.966
Leave me alone!

01:18:43.035 --> 01:18:45.135
I can't stand you.

01:18:45.579 --> 01:18:48.497
What's more, I hate you.

01:18:48.498 --> 01:18:50.641
I always hated you.

01:18:51.043 --> 01:18:52.960
With these magic words,

01:18:52.961 --> 01:18:55.463
Tita drove her mother's
ghost away forever

01:18:55.464 --> 01:18:58.174
and freed herself from her
psychological pregnancy.

01:18:58.175 --> 01:19:01.761
But she couldn't keep Mama Elena
from getting even with Pedro.

01:19:35.295 --> 01:19:38.631
Tita, don't go! Don't leave me.

01:19:38.632 --> 01:19:41.483
No, Pedro, I won't.

01:20:19.256 --> 01:20:22.232
Cover him with tepezcohuite bark.

01:20:28.223 --> 01:20:30.015
I'll miss you, Gertrudis.

01:20:30.016 --> 01:20:33.978
I'll miss you, too. I'd like to
stay and help you with Pedro.

01:20:33.979 --> 01:20:35.813
But I've been ordered
on to Torreón.

01:20:35.814 --> 01:20:38.149
- Be careful.
- You, too.

01:20:38.150 --> 01:20:42.153
Women soldiers avoid pregnancy by
washing with vinegar and water.

01:20:42.154 --> 01:20:44.796
Watch it from now on.

01:20:46.700 --> 01:20:49.551
That's enough. Now it's my turn.

01:20:51.872 --> 01:20:53.330
Thank you.

01:20:53.331 --> 01:20:56.125
Tell Pedro once he's well,
after the revolution,

01:20:56.126 --> 01:20:58.268
we'll do more duets.

01:21:04.092 --> 01:21:05.760
Let's go. It's getting late.

01:21:07.888 --> 01:21:09.513
Sergeant Trevino.

01:21:09.514 --> 01:21:12.949
Yes, my General. Let's go!

01:21:20.942 --> 01:21:23.502
I'll finally get a rest!

01:21:34.915 --> 01:21:36.874
Pedro, congratulations!

01:21:36.875 --> 01:21:39.752
You've recovered amazingly well.

01:21:39.753 --> 01:21:42.296
You won't be my
patient much longer.

01:21:42.297 --> 01:21:44.381
That's good. Thank you.

01:21:44.382 --> 01:21:46.884
It's lucky you got here in time.

01:21:46.885 --> 01:21:50.054
I wouldn't have known how
to use the tepezcohuite.

01:21:50.055 --> 01:21:53.490
Don't thank me. Thank
my grandmother.

01:21:54.226 --> 01:21:58.745
Her experiments with this
bark will be famous someday.

01:21:59.397 --> 01:22:03.818
Besides, with such a
loving nurse as you,

01:22:03.819 --> 01:22:07.337
who wouldn't get well fast?

01:22:07.531 --> 01:22:09.031
That's true.

01:22:09.032 --> 01:22:12.409
I'll fix you a drink
in the living room.

01:22:12.410 --> 01:22:13.786
No, thank you.

01:22:13.787 --> 01:22:18.666
I won't keep you from
preparing tonight's dinner.

01:22:18.667 --> 01:22:22.144
You didn't tell me the
doctor's coming tonight.

01:22:23.505 --> 01:22:26.632
It's just that my aunt,
who came for the wedding,

01:22:26.633 --> 01:22:30.026
is anxious to meet Tita.

01:22:30.679 --> 01:22:34.181
We were just waiting
for you to get better

01:22:34.182 --> 01:22:36.267
before arranging a visit.

01:22:36.268 --> 01:22:38.602
Now I understand

01:22:38.603 --> 01:22:41.496
why Tita nursed me so carefully.

01:22:41.690 --> 01:22:44.875
Exactly! You finally
figured it out!

01:22:45.277 --> 01:22:49.045
Come, John. I think
Pedro wants to rest.

01:22:50.448 --> 01:22:52.549
See you tomorrow, Pedro.

01:23:07.132 --> 01:23:10.175
You should have sent
Chencha with my food.

01:23:10.176 --> 01:23:13.236
You shouldn't be late
for your dinner.

01:23:17.559 --> 01:23:19.768
When will you tell him

01:23:19.769 --> 01:23:22.913
you can't marry him because
you're carrying my child?

01:23:25.817 --> 01:23:27.751
I can't tell him that.

01:23:28.069 --> 01:23:30.321
Afraid of hurting
little doc's feelings?

01:23:30.322 --> 01:23:34.825
It's not that. It would be
unfair to treat him like that.

01:23:34.826 --> 01:23:36.869
He deserves my utmost respect.

01:23:36.870 --> 01:23:39.705
If you don't, I will.

01:23:39.706 --> 01:23:43.125
No, you won't say anything.

01:23:43.126 --> 01:23:45.685
First, because I won't allow it,

01:23:46.171 --> 01:23:48.964
and second, because
I'm not pregnant.

01:23:48.965 --> 01:23:50.941
What?

01:23:51.426 --> 01:23:54.887
I thought I was pregnant,
but I was just late.

01:23:54.888 --> 01:23:56.180
But everything's good now.

01:23:56.181 --> 01:23:58.349
So that's it.

01:23:58.350 --> 01:23:59.475
Without being tied to me,

01:23:59.476 --> 01:24:01.894
you're torn between
staying with a sick man

01:24:01.895 --> 01:24:04.188
or marrying John, right?

01:24:04.189 --> 01:24:05.564
You're no longer sick.

01:24:05.565 --> 01:24:08.317
Even more reason for leaving me.

01:24:08.318 --> 01:24:11.737
My loving you more than anybody
doesn't matter to you.

01:24:11.738 --> 01:24:14.573
Neither do all the sacrifices
I've made for you.

01:24:14.574 --> 01:24:16.659
For me? Like what?

01:24:16.660 --> 01:24:21.137
Marrying your sister just to
be near you meant nothing?

01:24:22.207 --> 01:24:26.476
I wish you had just kidnapped me.

01:24:40.141 --> 01:24:42.935
We need to talk. It's long overdue.

01:24:42.936 --> 01:24:46.814
Yes, it's been due since the
day you married my boyfriend.

01:24:46.815 --> 01:24:50.859
Let's start there. You should
never have had a boyfriend.

01:24:50.860 --> 01:24:52.277
According to Mother or you?

01:24:52.278 --> 01:24:54.613
According to the family
tradition you broke.

01:24:54.614 --> 01:24:57.908
And which I'll continue to break
until I'm taken into account.

01:24:57.909 --> 01:25:00.327
I had the same right
to marriage as you.

01:25:00.328 --> 01:25:02.871
You had no right to
come between two people

01:25:02.872 --> 01:25:05.124
who loved each other deeply.

01:25:05.125 --> 01:25:06.750
Not that deeply.

01:25:06.751 --> 01:25:08.961
He simply replaced you with me.

01:25:08.962 --> 01:25:12.131
I married Pedro because
that's what he wanted.

01:25:12.132 --> 01:25:13.924
For your information,

01:25:13.925 --> 01:25:18.361
he married you to be near
me, but he didn't love you.

01:25:18.972 --> 01:25:20.597
Never mind the past.

01:25:20.598 --> 01:25:22.141
Pedro married me. Period.

01:25:22.142 --> 01:25:25.019
I won't have you two
making a fool of me.

01:25:25.020 --> 01:25:28.188
No one's making a fool of you.
You don't understand anything.

01:25:28.189 --> 01:25:29.273
Oh, really?

01:25:29.274 --> 01:25:31.942
And when everyone on
the ranch sees you

01:25:31.943 --> 01:25:34.194
crying on Pedro's
shoulder, holding hands?

01:25:34.195 --> 01:25:35.612
I'm the laughingstock!

01:25:35.613 --> 01:25:38.907
Look! I don't care if you
and Pedro go to hell

01:25:38.908 --> 01:25:41.702
for smooching in every dark corner!

01:25:41.703 --> 01:25:45.289
It's good he does it with you
because he'll never touch me again!

01:25:45.290 --> 01:25:48.375
In public, I will
continue to be the wife.

01:25:48.376 --> 01:25:52.103
And you'd better not let anyone
ever see you together again.

01:25:55.717 --> 01:25:59.386
Starting today, I'll care for
my daughter. You stay away!

01:25:59.387 --> 01:26:02.473
You'd set a bad example
and give her bad advice.

01:26:02.474 --> 01:26:05.976
You can be sure that I won't
let you ruin her life

01:26:05.977 --> 01:26:08.187
with this stupid family tradition.

01:26:08.188 --> 01:26:10.898
From a distance, you can't do much.

01:26:10.899 --> 01:26:13.108
Did you ever see prostitutes

01:26:13.109 --> 01:26:16.028
allowed near children
of decent families?

01:26:16.029 --> 01:26:18.947
You really think our
family is decent?

01:26:18.948 --> 01:26:20.824
My little family is.

01:26:20.825 --> 01:26:24.328
And to keep it decent, you'll
stay away from my daughter.

01:26:24.329 --> 01:26:28.098
Or I'll evict you from the
house Mother left me.

01:26:38.468 --> 01:26:40.219
Don't worry, my sweet.

01:26:40.220 --> 01:26:42.554
The tradition will die with me.

01:26:42.555 --> 01:26:44.280
Nobody'll hurt you.

01:26:54.692 --> 01:26:56.292
Mmm!

01:26:56.653 --> 01:26:59.530
This is delicious, Tita.

01:26:59.531 --> 01:27:01.131
Thank you.

01:27:01.616 --> 01:27:03.800
You're lucky, John,

01:27:04.119 --> 01:27:08.372
because Tita, aside from
being pretty and intelligent,

01:27:08.373 --> 01:27:11.208
also cooks wonderfully well.

01:27:11.209 --> 01:27:14.586
You will even gain weight
with that marriage,

01:27:14.587 --> 01:27:16.713
because, honest to God,

01:27:16.714 --> 01:27:19.800
Sue Ellen's cooking is awful.

01:27:19.801 --> 01:27:21.776
Is something wrong, Tita?

01:27:23.012 --> 01:27:27.015
Yes. I can't tell you now.

01:27:27.016 --> 01:27:29.309
Your aunt will feel left
out if we speak Spanish.

01:27:29.310 --> 01:27:31.828
Don't worry.

01:27:32.188 --> 01:27:34.998
She's completely deaf.

01:27:36.943 --> 01:27:39.111
How can she carry on conversations?

01:27:39.112 --> 01:27:41.613
Because she reads lips.

01:27:41.614 --> 01:27:44.032
But only in English.

01:27:44.033 --> 01:27:47.244
So feel free to talk,
because, in addition,

01:27:47.245 --> 01:27:50.747
while she's eating, she
notices nothing else.

01:27:50.748 --> 01:27:51.790
Watch this.

01:27:51.791 --> 01:27:53.850
Auntie.

01:27:54.586 --> 01:27:56.670
I'm marrying Tita because
the poor girl's crazy.

01:28:05.263 --> 01:28:06.346
Tita,

01:28:06.347 --> 01:28:09.975
the wedding is next week,

01:28:09.976 --> 01:28:14.329
so if there's a problem,
let's discuss it now.

01:28:15.148 --> 01:28:17.316
John, we'd better
cancel the wedding.

01:28:17.317 --> 01:28:19.876
But why?

01:28:21.529 --> 01:28:24.506
Don't make me tell you now.

01:28:24.824 --> 01:28:27.425
You don't love me anymore?

01:28:27.619 --> 01:28:29.803
I don't know.

01:28:33.625 --> 01:28:36.184
While you were away,

01:28:37.795 --> 01:28:40.589
I was with a man

01:28:40.590 --> 01:28:43.191
whom I have always loved.

01:28:45.595 --> 01:28:47.054
I lost my virginity.

01:28:47.055 --> 01:28:50.240
That's why we can't get married.

01:28:51.643 --> 01:28:55.620
Do you love him more
than you love me?

01:28:55.939 --> 01:28:58.540
When you're not here,

01:28:58.608 --> 01:29:01.167
I feel that he's the one I love.

01:29:01.778 --> 01:29:04.671
But when I see you,
everything changes.

01:29:05.156 --> 01:29:07.882
With you, I feel calm,

01:29:08.576 --> 01:29:10.593
safe,

01:29:10.662 --> 01:29:12.595
at peace...

01:29:14.207 --> 01:29:16.516
But I don't know...

01:29:16.918 --> 01:29:18.168
I don't know.

01:29:18.169 --> 01:29:23.966
It's so nice to see a young woman
in love cry from happiness.

01:29:23.967 --> 01:29:26.776
When I was about to be married,

01:29:26.844 --> 01:29:30.947
oh, many times, I cried, too.

01:29:32.058 --> 01:29:33.658
Always.

01:29:33.685 --> 01:29:36.770
Yes, well, I think we should
not embarrass Tita anymore

01:29:36.771 --> 01:29:39.247
- with our compliments.
- Excuse me.

01:29:40.692 --> 01:29:42.292
What's going on?

01:29:49.534 --> 01:29:51.134
Tita...

01:29:51.953 --> 01:29:54.762
I don't care what happened.

01:29:57.834 --> 01:30:01.686
It's not important if it didn't
change what's essential.

01:30:02.088 --> 01:30:05.815
I want to be your partner for life.

01:30:06.884 --> 01:30:11.487
You decide whether you want
me to be your partner.

01:30:13.641 --> 01:30:16.685
If you say yes, we'll get
married in a few days.

01:30:16.686 --> 01:30:21.414
If not, I'll be the first
to congratulate Pedro,

01:30:21.899 --> 01:30:23.942
and also

01:30:23.943 --> 01:30:26.419
the first to ask him...

01:30:27.238 --> 01:30:29.239
To demand

01:30:29.240 --> 01:30:31.549
that he give you what you deserve.

01:32:18.015 --> 01:32:21.451
Remember the first time
we heard that song?

01:32:23.479 --> 01:32:25.538
I'll never forget.

01:32:25.982 --> 01:32:27.274
I didn't sleep that night,

01:32:27.275 --> 01:32:29.568
thinking about asking
for your hand.

01:32:29.569 --> 01:32:32.863
I didn't know it
would take 22 years

01:32:32.864 --> 01:32:36.132
before I could ask you
again to be my wife.

01:32:37.535 --> 01:32:40.678
- Do you mean that?
- Of course!

01:32:41.038 --> 01:32:44.474
I don't want to die without
having you be my wife.

01:32:44.876 --> 01:32:49.838
I always dreamed of walking with you
into a church full of white flowers

01:32:49.839 --> 01:32:52.690
and you, the most
beautiful of them all.

01:32:53.885 --> 01:32:55.594
Dressed in white?

01:32:55.595 --> 01:32:57.653
Of course!

01:32:58.139 --> 01:33:00.223
There's nothing to stop you.

01:33:00.224 --> 01:33:03.351
Besides, I want us to have a child.

01:33:03.352 --> 01:33:05.854
There's still time,
don't you think?

01:33:05.855 --> 01:33:09.524
Now that Esperanza is
married and is leaving,

01:33:09.525 --> 01:33:11.693
we'll need company.

01:33:11.694 --> 01:33:15.129
And no one can
convince me otherwise.

01:33:16.032 --> 01:33:19.675
I don't care what my daughter
or anyone else thinks.

01:33:20.244 --> 01:33:23.805
We wasted many years worrying
about what others might say.

01:33:28.294 --> 01:33:30.420
Poor Rosaura.

01:33:30.421 --> 01:33:32.255
If she hadn't died,

01:33:32.256 --> 01:33:35.842
she'd really have enjoyed
her daughter's wedding.

01:33:35.843 --> 01:33:40.597
You think so? She told me that
she'd never let her get married,

01:33:40.598 --> 01:33:43.141
that Tita protected
that girl like a fiend,

01:33:43.142 --> 01:33:46.019
and that the house
became a battlefield.

01:33:46.020 --> 01:33:49.022
That's right. But let
me cry, all right?

01:33:52.944 --> 01:33:55.278
Fortunately, the fights
between Tita and Rosaura

01:33:55.279 --> 01:33:57.447
didn't last long.

01:33:57.448 --> 01:33:59.241
Because three days after

01:33:59.242 --> 01:34:01.910
their most violent
and tearful fight,

01:34:01.911 --> 01:34:05.805
Rosaura died of severe
digestive problems.

01:34:17.176 --> 01:34:20.611
Ah! Señorita Gertrudis!

01:34:20.805 --> 01:34:22.806
Look how elegant!

01:34:22.807 --> 01:34:25.074
Thank God you've arrived.

01:34:25.643 --> 01:34:27.827
It's a pleasure.

01:34:29.230 --> 01:34:31.982
Look at this beautiful girl!

01:34:31.983 --> 01:34:34.917
She looks just like
her grandfather.

01:34:36.487 --> 01:34:37.654
How handsome!

01:34:37.655 --> 01:34:39.739
Congratulations, Pedro.

01:34:39.740 --> 01:34:45.428
Your daughter couldn't have
found a better match than Alex.

01:34:45.580 --> 01:34:48.415
Yes, Alex Brown is
an excellent man.

01:34:48.416 --> 01:34:51.334
Too bad he got a PhD
scholarship at Harvard.

01:34:51.335 --> 01:34:53.503
Bad? That's excellent!

01:34:53.504 --> 01:34:58.341
No. He's taking her along with
him and we'll be left alone.

01:34:58.342 --> 01:35:01.261
How awful! What will you do, Tita?

01:35:01.262 --> 01:35:07.450
Without Esperanza, it'll look bad if
you stay here and live with Pedro.

01:35:08.185 --> 01:35:11.563
Oh, but before you leave,
give me the recipe

01:35:11.564 --> 01:35:12.939
for these chilies.

01:35:12.940 --> 01:35:15.416
They are heavenly.

01:35:15.568 --> 01:35:18.153
The secret is to make
them with lots of love.

01:35:18.154 --> 01:35:20.922
I hope you'll get them
right someday. Excuse me.

01:35:21.198 --> 01:35:22.882
How rude!

01:35:35.463 --> 01:35:38.048
Your son is a handsome groom.

01:35:38.049 --> 01:35:40.925
Isn't it nice that he
married Esperanza?

01:35:40.926 --> 01:35:42.177
Yes.

01:35:42.178 --> 01:35:44.487
Yes, it's true.

01:35:45.431 --> 01:35:47.390
Then why are you sad?

01:35:47.391 --> 01:35:50.644
Get happy. Dance with me.
My husband isn't here.

01:35:50.645 --> 01:35:53.162
The next song, Chencha.

01:37:11.642 --> 01:37:13.101
Be happy, my child.

01:37:13.102 --> 01:37:15.578
You take good care
of her, you hear?

01:37:15.896 --> 01:37:17.496
Bye, now.

01:40:01.854 --> 01:40:04.079
I love you.

01:40:04.148 --> 01:40:05.982
We're all alone.

01:40:05.983 --> 01:40:08.000
I love you!

01:40:08.319 --> 01:40:09.819
Nobody hears us.

01:40:09.820 --> 01:40:12.087
I love you!

01:40:35.763 --> 01:40:37.680
If an intense emotion

01:40:37.681 --> 01:40:43.102
lights all the matches
inside of us all at once,

01:40:43.103 --> 01:40:46.022
the brilliance would make us see

01:40:46.023 --> 01:40:49.817
a radiant tunnel

01:40:49.818 --> 01:40:53.738
showing us a path that
we forgot at birth.

01:40:53.739 --> 01:40:59.260
The soul will want to return
to its divine origin.

01:42:14.153 --> 01:42:17.488
When Esperanza, my mother,
returned from her honeymoon,

01:42:17.489 --> 01:42:20.783
all she found under what
remained of the ranch

01:42:20.784 --> 01:42:23.619
was this cookbook, which
she left me when she died.

01:42:23.620 --> 01:42:26.581
It tells the story
of this buried love.

01:42:26.582 --> 01:42:29.224
My mother!

01:42:31.253 --> 01:42:33.771
How I miss her cooking,

01:42:34.048 --> 01:42:36.190
the smell of her kitchen,

01:42:36.633 --> 01:42:41.179
her talking while she prepared
the meals, her Christmas rolls.

01:42:41.180 --> 01:42:43.973
Mine never come out like hers.

01:42:43.974 --> 01:42:48.619
And I wonder why I cry so
much while I make them.

01:42:48.937 --> 01:42:53.941
It must be that I'm as sensitive
to onions as Tita, my great-aunt.

01:42:53.942 --> 01:42:58.087
She'll continue to live as long
as someone cooks her recipes.
