00:58.116 --> 01:00.383
You got it sewn up
this year, Dex.

01:00.416 --> 01:02.416
Yeah, mandark
ain't got
nothing on--

01:02.450 --> 01:04.483
do not say that name.

01:05.016 --> 01:06.150
What, mandark?

01:06.183 --> 01:08.350
[Hisses]

01:11.066 --> 01:13.233
You are
the coolest,
mandark.

01:13.266 --> 01:17.050
Yeah, dorkster's
going to choke
this year for sure.

Ahem. Is this on? Yes.

01:25.366 --> 01:27.350
Greetings, students and parents.

01:27.383 --> 01:28.483
I'm proud to announce

01:29.016 --> 01:31.150
the winner of
this year's science fair.

01:31.183 --> 01:32.383
It was close this year,

01:32.416 --> 01:36.166
but, alas, the coveted
first prize will go to one

01:36.200 --> 01:37.366
and only one.

01:37.400 --> 01:41.016
And this year, the winner is...

01:41.383 --> 01:43.100
Soyen chen.

01:43.133 --> 01:44.000
Thank you...

01:44.033 --> 01:45.150
Wasn't this most unexpected?

01:45.183 --> 01:46.383
I knew it
all along.

01:46.416 --> 01:48.250
What?!
What?!

01:48.416 --> 01:50.450
Mandark and Dexter:
"The unified theory

01:50.483 --> 01:52.333
of world domination
and destruction"?

01:52.366 --> 01:55.366
Soyen: It's just
a simple equation, really.

[Crowd gasps]

Yay!

02:01.200 --> 02:04.250
Yay!
Yay!

02:04.283 --> 02:05.333
Woo!
Woo!

02:05.366 --> 02:08.300
She's beyond technology.

02:08.333 --> 02:11.133
Dealing only in numbers.

02:11.166 --> 02:13.266
A much higher intelligence.

02:13.300 --> 02:15.083
Who is she?
Who is she?

02:15.116 --> 02:17.033
Our newest
student--
soyen chen.

02:17.066 --> 02:18.233
Smart as
they come.

02:18.266 --> 02:19.416
I expect
she'll be

02:19.450 --> 02:21.266
our new
pride
and joy.

02:21.300 --> 02:23.100
She must be destroyed.

02:23.133 --> 02:26.150
I never thought I would
say this, mandark,

02:26.183 --> 02:28.350
but I could not
agree with you more.

02:28.383 --> 02:31.050
Dexter, we must put
our differences aside

02:31.083 --> 02:32.450
and eliminate
this new threat.

02:32.483 --> 02:35.366
You mean, work together?

02:35.400 --> 02:37.383
War makes
strange bedfellows.

02:37.416 --> 02:40.066
Let's team up!
Let's team up!

02:40.100 --> 02:42.450
Dexter, with our
combined intellect,

02:42.483 --> 02:44.216
we'll be unstoppable.

02:44.250 --> 02:45.316
Bring your
best weapon

02:45.350 --> 02:49.166
and meet me
in front of her
house tomorrow.

02:49.333 --> 02:52.100
I can't wait to
see what you bring.

02:52.133 --> 02:56.000
Dexter, silly voice:
"I can't wait to see
what you'll bring."

02:56.033 --> 02:57.266
[Regular voice]
Mandark. Sheesh.

02:57.300 --> 02:59.466
I wonder what
he'll bring tomorrow.

03:00.000 --> 03:03.300
Oh, that's right--
he's a complete idiot.

03:05.466 --> 03:10.316
Well, I suppose I'll
just have to handle
the whole job myself.

03:21.116 --> 03:22.366
Mandark: Oh,
there you are, Dexter.

03:22.400 --> 03:26.433
I was just
preparing to destroy
the new threat...

03:26.466 --> 03:28.033
Without you.

03:28.066 --> 03:30.433
Well, if you think
you can handle it.

03:30.466 --> 03:34.000
I don't think it'll be
a problem, Dexter.

03:34.383 --> 03:38.166
Whoa! You're letting
her get away!

03:52.033 --> 03:56.166
I have never met
a bigger dork
than you, Dexter!

03:56.200 --> 03:58.150
Bummer.

03:58.183 --> 03:59.400
Typical mandark.

03:59.433 --> 04:01.116
You create that beast,

04:01.150 --> 04:02.483
but you can't even
operate it.

04:03.016 --> 04:05.483
Do you know
how short you
look right now?

04:06.016 --> 04:08.166
Thus making you the dumbest

04:08.200 --> 04:10.050
kid in the school, again.

04:10.083 --> 04:11.266
Did you guys know

04:11.300 --> 04:14.100
that there was
a math test today?

04:14.133 --> 04:16.216
I got an "a."

04:17.283 --> 04:18.400
Team up!
Team up!

04:18.433 --> 04:21.033
Ok, you will operate
the lateral movements

04:21.066 --> 04:23.250
of the laser Cannon
on the satellite,

04:23.283 --> 04:25.466
and I will operate...

04:26.450 --> 04:28.200
The vertical.

04:28.233 --> 04:32.066
Mandark, I thought
we were gonna...

04:37.150 --> 04:39.300
Ha ha-ha!
Ha ha-ha ha-ha!

04:39.333 --> 04:41.316
Ha ha-ha!

04:42.400 --> 04:46.150
Soyen: I thought
you guys liked school.

04:46.250 --> 04:48.283
I have reconfigured
my liquid squirt gun

04:48.316 --> 04:50.383
to withstand
biohazardous materials.

04:50.416 --> 04:53.083
What did you come up
with, Dexter?

04:53.116 --> 04:55.250
It is an extremely
powerful mutating agent.

04:55.283 --> 04:59.183
You must not get any of it
on yourself, mandark.

04:59.216 --> 05:01.383
You must be very careful.

05:01.416 --> 05:02.350
[Sighs]

05:02.383 --> 05:06.083
I think I can
handle it, Dexter.

[Sizzles]

05:13.300 --> 05:14.183
[Sighs]

05:14.216 --> 05:16.016
Uh, mandark,
did you spill

05:16.050 --> 05:18.166
some of my mutating
agent on yourself?

05:18.200 --> 05:21.016
Uh, yes, yes, I did.
I did it intentionally.

05:21.050 --> 05:23.133
But as I suspected,
it had no effect.

05:23.166 --> 05:25.466
It seems you have once
again ruined the plan.

05:26.000 --> 05:26.483
Oh, really?

05:27.016 --> 05:29.066
My mutating agent
has no effect, huh?

05:29.100 --> 05:32.216
Well, it's a good thing
it does not work, mandark,

05:32.250 --> 05:35.483
because if it did, I would
probably be turning

05:36.016 --> 05:39.066
into a sickening
creature right now!

05:39.433 --> 05:41.166
Hi, boys.

05:41.200 --> 05:43.183
Need a hand?

05:52.166 --> 05:56.316
I think you should let me
handle this one, mandark.

05:56.350 --> 05:57.483
Nonsense, Dexter!

05:58.016 --> 06:00.233
I just got
the double-x 10 arm
attachment yesterday.

06:00.266 --> 06:02.350
So you and your
pile of junk step aside!

06:02.383 --> 06:06.316
Well, this pile
of junk would ruin
your bucket of bolts!

06:06.350 --> 06:08.183
I'd like to test
that theory!

06:08.216 --> 06:10.016
Maybe I will
test it, then!

06:10.050 --> 06:11.416
Maybe you will,
maybe you won't!

06:11.450 --> 06:15.316
Uh, yeah, well,
uh, uh, maybe!

06:22.216 --> 06:23.466
[Yells]

06:24.000 --> 06:27.033
So, you want to cheat, huh?

06:33.333 --> 06:36.000
Ow! Ow! Ow!

06:36.033 --> 06:39.416
Prepare for your
destruction, Dexter.

06:41.400 --> 06:44.266
[Punches being thrown]

[Screams]

Eject!

07:11.366 --> 07:12.333
Well, Dexter,

07:12.366 --> 07:14.183
I think we must
admit defeat.

07:14.216 --> 07:18.016
She has bested us with
her superior knowledge
of science.

07:18.050 --> 07:19.383
[Muffled]
Yes, mandark.

07:19.416 --> 07:21.066
Ah...i know.

07:21.100 --> 07:22.083
Science?

07:22.116 --> 07:24.350
I'm not even into
that stuff anymore.

07:24.383 --> 07:25.366
What?

07:25.400 --> 07:28.066
Not into science?
What else is there?

07:28.100 --> 07:30.450
Oh...boys.

07:31.333 --> 07:33.333
Aah!
Aah!

07:33.366 --> 07:36.150
[Soyen blowing kisses]

07:53.433 --> 07:55.016
Sorry, buddy,

07:55.050 --> 07:59.100
but I got to make room
for the new guy.

08:02.350 --> 08:03.450
Mom: Come on, Dexter.

08:03.483 --> 08:07.083
You're going to be
late for the chess
competition.

08:07.116 --> 08:09.216
I know how important
it is to you.

08:09.250 --> 08:11.150
You don't want
to be late, do you?

08:11.183 --> 08:13.250
What is it you think
you are doing, mom?

08:13.283 --> 08:17.166
Well, I've been feeling
a little left out
of your life,

08:17.200 --> 08:19.283
so your father suggested
that me taking you

08:19.316 --> 08:21.333
to the chess
championships
from now on

08:21.366 --> 08:24.316
would be a perfect way
for us to spend

08:24.350 --> 08:26.150
some dexter/mom time
together.

08:26.183 --> 08:29.216
Besides, your father got
playoff tickets.

08:29.250 --> 08:32.016
Hee hee hee!

08:32.050 --> 08:33.450
[Sighs]

08:43.150 --> 08:44.150
Dexter!

08:44.183 --> 08:47.333
I'll be right over there
if you need me!

08:47.366 --> 08:49.316

08:50.050 --> 08:54.100
Hey, good-looking,
be back to pick you up later.

junior state chess championship.

I'd like to thank you all
for coming.

09:03.150 --> 09:06.083
Yeah, is this seat taken?

09:11.016 --> 09:12.450
I'd like to remind everyone

09:12.483 --> 09:15.316
that this is
a chess competition.

09:15.350 --> 09:19.233
So please try and keep
the responses to the games

09:19.266 --> 09:21.150
within the spirit of chess.

09:21.183 --> 09:23.383
That's my Dexter
right over there!

09:23.416 --> 09:26.016
He's the reigning champ,
you know.

09:26.050 --> 09:27.166
Yeah!

to help me in welcoming
back

3 years running--Dexter.

Huh? Oh! Ha ha!

09:34.250 --> 09:35.383
Thank you,
thank you.

09:35.416 --> 09:37.150
Please, please.
No, no, no.

09:37.183 --> 09:39.233
Hold your
applause
till the end.

very much.

Over here!

Hi, honey! Smile!

09:46.016 --> 09:47.400
Is that your mom?

09:47.433 --> 09:49.150
Uh, I have no mom.

09:49.183 --> 09:50.400
Uh...for those of you

09:50.433 --> 09:53.466
unfamiliar with the rules
of this competition,

09:54.000 --> 09:56.416
each of these
junior chess finalists

09:56.450 --> 09:58.383
will have to play against Dexter

09:58.416 --> 10:01.066
for his seat and the trophy.

10:01.100 --> 10:02.183
All right.

10:02.216 --> 10:04.016
Ready. Begin.

10:04.050 --> 10:06.100
[Clock ticking]

10:08.266 --> 10:11.300
Let us play some chess.

10:36.183 --> 10:40.350
Ha! Top that, cool guy.

10:42.116 --> 10:43.466
Dexter: Checkmate!

10:44.000 --> 10:46.400
How cool do you feel
now, huh?

10:46.433 --> 10:48.033
Mom: Wa-hoo!

10:48.066 --> 10:51.133
All right!
You won! Yeah!

10:51.166 --> 10:52.133
Yes!

10:52.166 --> 10:53.383
All right!

10:53.416 --> 10:56.050
Who's your daddy?!

10:56.083 --> 10:59.366
Obviously
not as cool as you.

11:01.350 --> 11:04.233
Here it comes, everybody.

11:04.266 --> 11:07.250

11:33.200 --> 11:34.200
Ok, everyone.

11:34.233 --> 11:37.166
Looks like we've reached
the final match.

11:37.200 --> 11:39.200
Lights, please.

11:39.233 --> 11:41.116
Oh! The final match!

11:41.150 --> 11:44.450
I am so excited,
I can't stand it!

11:44.483 --> 11:46.233
Uh, mediator,

11:46.266 --> 11:48.300
can I have
5 minutes, please?

11:48.333 --> 11:50.316
Ok, everyone,
let's take a short break

11:50.350 --> 11:53.116
and we'll come back
with the final match.

11:53.150 --> 11:54.250
You just
stay loose.
Mom.

11:54.283 --> 11:56.333
Don't let them
intimidate you.
Mom!

11:56.366 --> 11:58.316
Mom, you are not
listening to me.

11:58.350 --> 12:00.433
Calm down.
What is it?

12:00.466 --> 12:02.000
Well...

12:02.033 --> 12:03.016
Although I appreciate

12:03.050 --> 12:06.366
all the cheering
and rooting for me...

12:12.216 --> 12:13.333
It's for glare.

12:13.366 --> 12:14.433
Aah! Forget it!

12:14.466 --> 12:19.400
You just do not understand
the spirit of chess.

12:21.266 --> 12:22.233
Uh--

12:22.266 --> 12:26.133
don't understand
the spirit of chess?

12:28.250 --> 12:30.066
What's he talking about?

12:30.100 --> 12:32.200
I'm practically made of spirit.

12:32.233 --> 12:36.283
[European accent]
Now you ready for
embarrassing defeat?

12:36.316 --> 12:40.366
Ha ha! I believe it
is you, sir,
who should be...

Einstein's ghost!

He's so smart,
he's so smart,

12:52.316 --> 12:55.116
he's gonna make
this party start!

Go...dexter!
