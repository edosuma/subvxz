HERE I COME.

21:58.817 --> 22:00.452
AND NO ONE WILL
EVER HAVE TO ASK YOU

22:00.452 --> 22:03.155
IF YOU WEAR
BOXERS OR BRIEFS.

22:03.155 --> 22:05.290
HUH? OH, MAN.

22:08.327 --> 22:12.397
OK, YOU ALREADY SAW ONE
OF MARTY'S DEAD END JOBS,

22:12.397 --> 22:15.500
HERE'S A FEW MORE
YOU DIDN'T SEE.

22:15.500 --> 22:19.404
THERE WAS MARTY,
THE CRUISE DIRECTOR.

22:19.404 --> 22:22.374
MARTY, THE FITNESS INSTRUCTOR,

22:22.374 --> 22:26.578
AND MY OWN PERSONAL FAVORITE,
MARTY, THE CHORUS BOY.

22:26.578 --> 22:30.349
WHO SAYS THE UNDEAD
DON'T GOT RHYTHM?
