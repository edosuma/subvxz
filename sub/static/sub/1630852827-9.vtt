WEBVTT

00:21.760 --> 00:23.160
My first festival!

00:23.640 --> 00:26.840
We're a bit early but it's okay,
we'll avoid super long lines.

00:27.040 --> 00:28.440
-This will be amazing.
-Yeah.

00:28.600 --> 00:30.880
Will we get wristbands?
I always wanted one.

00:31.000 --> 00:32.440
Sure. You just stay with me,

00:32.600 --> 00:34.680
I've been to three
of these things.

00:34.840 --> 00:38.040
Can we go to the bathroom?
I'm desperate. It's the nerves.

00:38.040 --> 00:38.120
Can we go to the bathroom?
I'm desperate. It's the nerves.
Okay, let's go straight to pee,
because later it's a mission.

00:38.120 --> 00:41.800
Okay, let's go straight to pee,
because later it's a mission.

00:41.960 --> 00:43.800
I missed One Direction,
waiting in line.

00:43.960 --> 00:45.800
One Direction?
I'd have peed in a bottle.

00:45.960 --> 00:48.080
Yeah, in front of everyone
with my ass out.

00:48.280 --> 00:50.240
I'm not missing anything today.

00:50.360 --> 00:52.480
I won't get a chance
like this for a long time.

00:52.640 --> 00:54.720
You deserve it
after your family dramas.

00:55.360 --> 00:57.600
Yeah, well.
I hope my mom gets better.

00:58.560 --> 01:01.000
Let's not think about it now.
It's festival time!

01:01.160 --> 01:02.160
-Yeah!
-Come on.

01:02.360 --> 01:04.200
-I got my first wristband.
-Yeah!

01:05.120 --> 01:06.120
Let's go.

01:13.600 --> 01:17.120
CRAZY

01:20.120 --> 01:21.120
Hey, Isabel.

01:21.320 --> 01:22.640
-What do you want?
-Look...

01:22.840 --> 01:24.920
If you're bringing me
more weird crap, save it.

01:25.080 --> 01:27.080
-I'm done with mysteries.
-You have a call.

01:27.280 --> 01:29.040
I don't feel like talking.

01:30.320 --> 01:31.320
Is it Sol?

01:32.320 --> 01:35.080
-Is it my daughter?
-It's your husband.

01:35.240 --> 01:36.400
My husband?

01:36.560 --> 01:37.720
-Yes.
-I'm not married.

01:37.920 --> 01:40.160
The guy on the phone
says he's your husband.

01:40.360 --> 01:42.360
He's insisting
on talking to you.

01:43.200 --> 01:44.200
Thanks.

01:52.080 --> 01:53.160
Shit.

01:53.240 --> 01:54.800
He's one of the ex-cons.

01:57.760 --> 01:58.760
Holy shit.

01:58.960 --> 02:00.920
We must get the photo
to the press now.

02:01.080 --> 02:04.120
And alert him, giving him time
to go into hiding?

02:04.120 --> 02:05.360
He's already in hiding.

02:05.480 --> 02:07.960
We need any tip
that might help us find him.

02:10.520 --> 02:12.480
I agree. Get it circulated.

02:24.480 --> 02:28.080
Hello. Pretending to be
my husband to speak to me?

02:29.320 --> 02:32.160
You're unbelievable, Nieto.
A real shrewd operator.

02:32.680 --> 02:35.360
Surprise.
Did you like the flowers?

02:39.480 --> 02:41.120
I couldn't decide
between yellow or red.

02:42.080 --> 02:43.840
But red is a color of passion

02:44.000 --> 02:45.960
and our love
broke down long ago...

02:46.120 --> 02:47.480
Why are you calling?

02:47.680 --> 02:50.120
If you're looking for humanity
or compassion,

02:50.240 --> 02:52.160
-I won't forgive you.
-No, I know.

02:52.880 --> 02:55.160
You hold a grudge. Unfairly.

02:56.000 --> 02:59.040
You can't compare what you did
to me with what I did to you.

03:00.320 --> 03:02.040
Fifteen minutes
of sexual discord

03:02.160 --> 03:03.840
versus 16 years behind bars.

03:04.160 --> 03:05.720
I think the scales
tip in my favor.

03:05.880 --> 03:07.120
Sexual discord?

03:08.160 --> 03:10.640
You bastard.
What you did was brutal.

03:11.840 --> 03:14.760
Don't call me, come near me,
or send me flowers.

03:14.960 --> 03:16.400
Oh, you'll want to talk to me.

03:17.720 --> 03:19.320
Your daughter... well,

03:20.280 --> 03:22.000
the thing you and I made,

03:22.920 --> 03:24.360
is at a concert right now.

03:24.560 --> 03:27.280
-Why would you mention her?
-See, you do want to talk.

03:27.480 --> 03:28.480
Don't touch her.

03:28.600 --> 03:30.400
Planet Sound Festival.
Ring any bells?

03:30.600 --> 03:32.640
It would be great
if you could join us.

03:33.400 --> 03:35.000
-Are you with her?
-She's right here.

03:35.880 --> 03:37.680
A stone's throw away,
as people say.

03:37.880 --> 03:39.280
If you harm my daughter,
I'll kill you.

03:39.440 --> 03:42.120
As it's a family matter,
nobody else needs to know.

03:43.040 --> 03:45.720
-I'm sure you get my point.
-I won't tell anyone.

03:47.000 --> 03:48.960
-Don't touch her.
-Good.

03:50.200 --> 03:52.240
And if I were you,
I'd leave now.

03:52.400 --> 03:54.120
You don't want
to miss the best part.

03:55.640 --> 03:58.320
Don't forget your ticket.
It'll be quite the show.

04:41.960 --> 04:42.960
Three thousand euros.

04:46.880 --> 04:48.560
You're going to pay me
3000 euros?

04:48.760 --> 04:50.720
Does that seem too little?
A lot?

04:52.360 --> 04:53.360
What for?

04:53.880 --> 04:55.240
For being me, easy.

04:56.120 --> 04:57.120
That's all?

04:57.680 --> 04:58.680
That's all.

05:00.320 --> 05:02.080
Well, it's a lot of money

05:02.280 --> 05:05.000
-for not much work.
-I pay who and what I want.

05:06.040 --> 05:09.120
What good is money
if you can't help those in need?

05:09.120 --> 05:11.040
Do a good job,
there'll be more work.

05:11.040 --> 05:13.160
So, locking me up
was unnecessary.

05:13.600 --> 05:15.080
I would have said yes.

05:16.080 --> 05:18.200
Yes, perhaps that was a bit
over the top.

05:20.080 --> 05:21.360
All's well that ends well.

05:23.960 --> 05:25.400
Put this suit on.

06:11.120 --> 06:13.520
If you don't want to do it,
I can't force you.

06:16.000 --> 06:17.000
Tell me something.

06:17.120 --> 06:20.440
Why do you need someone
to pretend to be you?

06:20.600 --> 06:21.600
Tell me the truth.

06:22.440 --> 06:24.880
I told you a woman
ruined my life, right?

06:25.680 --> 06:26.840
The one in the photo.

06:28.080 --> 06:29.080
We have a daughter.

06:29.840 --> 06:31.000
The kid loves me.

06:31.480 --> 06:33.040
But her mom
won't let us see each other.

06:34.120 --> 06:36.480
She says I didn't live up
to her expectations

06:36.640 --> 06:38.320
when we were together.
Sound familiar?

06:39.200 --> 06:41.120
The three of us
have never been together.

06:42.400 --> 06:45.080
So I came up with a strategy
to make the mother see sense.

06:47.480 --> 06:50.000
-I always wanted to have kids.
-Right?

06:50.120 --> 06:53.040
There's nothing more beautiful
than giving life.

07:31.200 --> 07:35.640
PROPERTY OWNERSHIP TAX
ANDREA LLANES CASTRO

07:41.600 --> 07:43.760
Cris, have you seen
a jacket around?

07:43.960 --> 07:46.720
I've looked at home, in the car,
I can't find it anywhere.

07:46.880 --> 07:49.040
-No.
-Is something wrong?

07:49.240 --> 07:50.320
Haven't you seen the news?

07:50.520 --> 07:52.720
They identified
the Parot killer.

07:54.920 --> 07:55.920
Look.

08:00.120 --> 08:02.040
He's one of them,
it's incredible.

08:03.720 --> 08:04.720
I'll get it.

08:09.520 --> 08:11.960
PAROT CASE KILLER IDENTIFIED
AS ROBERTO PLAZA

08:23.720 --> 08:24.720
It's not possible.

08:26.000 --> 08:27.000
It can't be.

08:31.280 --> 08:33.640
-Wasn't this man on your radar?
-Absolutely.

08:33.840 --> 08:35.760
The result of a new line
of inquiry.

08:35.880 --> 08:37.160
It's how I've always worked.

08:38.200 --> 08:41.440
Thank you. Sorry, this will be
on the news, right?

08:41.600 --> 08:43.600
-Yes.
-Thanks.

08:44.280 --> 08:47.000
Someone called. The suspect is
at his boarding house.

08:47.200 --> 08:48.680
-Do you have the address?
-Yes.

08:49.120 --> 08:51.080
-Let's go.
-Shouldn't we wait for Nieto

08:51.240 --> 08:52.720
-and the boss?
-Let's go.

09:09.160 --> 09:10.760
We're leaving in six minutes.

09:10.920 --> 09:13.000
Now's the time
to use the bathroom.

09:24.160 --> 09:25.480
I've really outdone myself.

09:26.440 --> 09:27.440
I don't look like me.

09:28.480 --> 09:31.360
You're skilled. You should be
a sculptor or a potter.

09:31.560 --> 09:34.560
Do you really think
I'm going to waste my 250 IQ

09:34.720 --> 09:35.960
on making clay masks?

09:36.800 --> 09:38.160
I'm just getting something.

11:12.040 --> 11:13.280
Police. Open the door.

11:16.000 --> 11:17.400
Open up. Police!

11:58.120 --> 12:00.120
Hey, what's going on in there?

12:25.160 --> 12:26.360
You'll put this on.

12:30.040 --> 12:31.520
And follow my instructions.

12:32.000 --> 12:33.040
Step by step.

12:33.680 --> 12:35.440
Wouldn't you rather explain?

12:35.640 --> 12:37.040
-So I know what I'm doing.
-No.

12:37.920 --> 12:41.160
I mean, if I'm in on it,
I can be of more use.

12:41.360 --> 12:44.760
No, nobody is as useful to me
as you are right now. Okay?

12:44.960 --> 12:47.040
Thanks,
but I haven't done anything yet.

12:47.760 --> 12:50.160
Well. One for you.

12:50.160 --> 12:51.240
And one for me.

12:53.160 --> 12:54.320
We'll go in separately.

12:56.280 --> 12:58.000
And don't talk to anyone.

12:58.000 --> 13:00.680
-I'll do a good job, you'll see.
-Of course.

13:02.040 --> 13:03.040
Look closely.

13:04.000 --> 13:05.320
If you see her, steer clear.

13:06.720 --> 13:08.880
-Is that your daughter?
-I'm meeting her inside.

13:10.240 --> 13:11.720
It'll all turn out fine.

13:12.440 --> 13:15.480
-Are we going in?
-We'll give her a little longer.

13:16.520 --> 13:19.000
-Who?
-My daughter's mother.

13:28.080 --> 13:30.680
-How's it looking?
-Not good. He's going to ICU.

13:54.280 --> 13:56.480
Look where
your stupid vanity got you.

13:57.680 --> 13:59.480
Let the dead rest
in peace, Nieto.

13:59.680 --> 14:01.520
You shouldn't
have listened to him.

14:02.040 --> 14:03.600
And less finger-pointing.

14:05.760 --> 14:08.320
Asking for citizen participation
was a good decision.

14:08.440 --> 14:10.280
His mistake was
not bringing back-up.

14:10.440 --> 14:12.600
Yeah, tell that
to Perea's wife at his funeral.

14:12.720 --> 14:13.920
He's not dead yet.

14:14.840 --> 14:18.400
Look, Nieto, all I'm concerned
with is arresting Plaza.

14:18.520 --> 14:21.880
So forget what might have been
and focus on finding him.

14:23.160 --> 14:24.800
Sir, we just found this.

14:25.200 --> 14:26.560
Why is it soaking wet?

14:26.960 --> 14:28.520
It was in the toilet tank.

14:33.040 --> 14:34.000
Excuse me.

14:35.040 --> 14:36.920
-Hey, what are you doing?
-Sorry.

14:39.840 --> 14:41.040
She's here.

14:41.360 --> 14:42.840
Yes, copy that.

14:44.080 --> 14:47.280
-You know what you have to do.
-Don't worry, we're good.

14:48.120 --> 14:49.400
I never thought otherwise.

14:49.600 --> 14:51.920
-I'll find us a space.
-I'll head to the bar.

14:52.120 --> 14:53.600
Nobody expects the unexpected.

15:21.160 --> 15:23.720
-Sol.
-Why are you here?

15:23.920 --> 15:26.200
-Did you like your gift?
-What gift?

15:27.280 --> 15:28.280
This.

15:31.280 --> 15:32.960
You sent me the tickets?

15:33.160 --> 15:35.160
-I thought you'd like them.
-Thank you.

15:36.760 --> 15:38.720
But I don't need anything
from you.

15:38.920 --> 15:41.040
I want to fix things between us.

15:41.920 --> 15:43.960
And with your mother too,
of course.

15:44.560 --> 15:46.400
Well,
that's pretty much impossible.

15:56.040 --> 15:57.040
Right.

15:59.800 --> 16:03.320
Why don't you wait over there
and I'll tell you my plan?

16:04.040 --> 16:05.080
-Want a drink?
-Okay.

16:06.000 --> 16:08.080
-Whatever.
-I'll go get it.

17:03.480 --> 17:06.080
You can head off.
I have no more patients today.

17:06.080 --> 17:06.160
You can head off.
I have no more patients today.
There's a cop here
to speak to you.

17:06.160 --> 17:08.080
There's a cop here
to speak to you.

17:10.160 --> 17:11.320
Should I send him in?

17:12.520 --> 17:14.000
Yes, of course.

17:22.080 --> 17:25.440
-I was just leaving.
-Don't tell me you need therapy.

17:25.640 --> 17:28.200
Very possibly.
If I lay down on this couch,

17:28.360 --> 17:31.000
-I wouldn't get up in months.
-It's all yours.

17:31.920 --> 17:34.080
-How's Isabel?
-Fine.

17:34.880 --> 17:37.080
Well, these things take time.

17:37.920 --> 17:40.600
I'm really grateful you came
to check up on her.

17:41.680 --> 17:44.000
Honestly,
I'm here about something else.

17:44.720 --> 17:47.120
It's about
the Parot case killer.

17:47.880 --> 17:48.880
We know who it is.

17:49.120 --> 17:51.040
I don't know
if you saw it on the news?

17:51.040 --> 17:53.040
I may spend my time
curing past traumas,

17:53.040 --> 17:53.080
I may spend my time
curing past traumas,
but I'm not completely
out the loop.

17:53.080 --> 17:55.000
but I'm not completely
out the loop.

17:55.000 --> 17:55.040
but I'm not completely
out the loop.
According to prison records,
you treated him for two years.

17:55.040 --> 17:59.000
According to prison records,
you treated him for two years.

18:00.360 --> 18:02.080
Yes, that's right.

18:05.160 --> 18:07.360
-Have you caught him?
-He escaped.

18:08.840 --> 18:11.520
That's why I need your help.

18:12.640 --> 18:14.320
I don't know, give us something,

18:14.520 --> 18:17.320
any friends, old girlfriends,

18:17.480 --> 18:19.800
a place he might go
to hide out...

18:20.000 --> 18:22.080
Therapists get told
a lot of stuff.

18:23.000 --> 18:26.800
Well, his parents are dead
and he always said...

18:26.960 --> 18:31.440
well, he said he was alone,
that he had nobody in the world.

18:31.640 --> 18:32.760
Yeah, I know.

18:33.520 --> 18:37.840
We checked and no family,
not even a dog to come home to.

18:37.960 --> 18:41.000
Even so,
at some point in your meetings

18:41.000 --> 18:41.080
Even so,
at some point in your meetings
he may have said something.
You spent hours together.

18:41.080 --> 18:44.080
he may have said something.
You spent hours together.

18:45.080 --> 18:47.880
Anything at all we can go on
to help us find him

18:48.000 --> 18:49.000
would really help.

18:52.040 --> 18:53.080
Andrea.

18:54.080 --> 18:55.080
He's dangerous.

18:57.720 --> 19:01.040
He was truly remorseful
for what he did to that girl.

19:02.040 --> 19:05.000
What a way to show it,
killing a few more.

19:07.840 --> 19:11.000
Anyway, if I remember anything,
I'll let you know.

19:11.880 --> 19:12.880
Okay.

19:15.000 --> 19:18.880
One day you can explain to me
how the human mind is capable

19:19.000 --> 19:22.160
of justifying murder
and living with it.

19:23.560 --> 19:27.160
I don't have all the answers.
Everyone's mind is different.

19:28.920 --> 19:31.200
-Goodnight.
-Night.

20:40.080 --> 20:41.280
Where's my daughter?

21:24.080 --> 21:25.160
Police.

21:26.040 --> 21:27.360
Hands up, drop your weapon.

21:34.360 --> 21:35.440
Mom?

21:49.800 --> 21:50.800
Freeze!

21:53.280 --> 21:56.040
A police officer
has just killed a man.

21:56.480 --> 21:58.840
The officer's name
is Isabel Mora.

21:59.120 --> 22:00.960
-She's armed and on the loose.
-Shit.

22:01.120 --> 22:02.480
The victim is
Manuel Herrero...

22:02.640 --> 22:04.240
She really screwed up
this time.

22:09.160 --> 22:10.000
Goddammit.

23:25.920 --> 23:28.920
Train stations,
bus stations, airports,

23:29.040 --> 23:30.440
car rental companies.

23:30.600 --> 23:33.480
Taxi companies.
Get them to talk to all drivers.

23:34.000 --> 23:36.040
I want any means
of transport covered,

23:36.160 --> 23:37.600
even the rowboats in the park.

23:39.360 --> 23:40.760
Lots of people have died.

23:41.360 --> 23:43.200
And if there is a threat,
he'll shoot to kill.

23:43.360 --> 23:44.680
So be careful.

23:45.480 --> 23:47.080
As for our next case...

23:48.080 --> 23:49.920
Get a search warrant
for her apartment.

23:50.120 --> 23:52.400
-We need to know if she's been.
-Excuse me, sir.

23:52.520 --> 23:54.640
We just got a report
of a stolen truck.

23:54.840 --> 23:56.200
-Plaza?
-It was at a retreat

23:56.400 --> 23:58.760
-in the mountains.
-She's in that truck. Go!

23:59.040 --> 24:00.360
Nieto, wait here.

24:00.840 --> 24:02.600
Let's check access points
at the retreat.

24:42.960 --> 24:44.760
Speak to Parks and Recreation,

24:44.960 --> 24:46.080
shut the area down.

24:46.080 --> 24:46.120
shut the area down.
Leaving only one access point...

24:46.120 --> 24:48.760
Leaving only one access point...

24:57.360 --> 24:58.360
Andrea.

24:58.480 --> 25:00.320
Come on, you shouldn't be here.

25:00.520 --> 25:02.080
-Come on.
-What happened?

25:03.040 --> 25:05.240
What do you know?
You have to tell me something.

25:05.400 --> 25:07.400
-Grandma!
-Sol!

25:13.600 --> 25:14.600
Thank you.

25:15.840 --> 25:18.080
We have the search warrant
for Isabel's house.

25:18.080 --> 25:19.640
Should we question the mother?

25:19.960 --> 25:22.000
What for?
I wouldn't give us anything

25:22.000 --> 25:22.080
What for?
I wouldn't give us anything
if I were hiding my daughter.
Anyway, just look at her.

25:22.080 --> 25:25.040
if I were hiding my daughter.
Anyway, just look at her.

25:25.240 --> 25:27.120
She's in shock.
She knows nothing.

25:27.120 --> 25:30.240
But you can get authorization
to intercept her phone.

25:30.400 --> 25:32.240
You think Isabel might
get in touch?

25:32.400 --> 25:34.000
She may, it's her mother.

25:35.480 --> 25:36.880
And Nieto's phone, too.

25:48.160 --> 25:49.160
Isabel Mora,

25:50.040 --> 25:51.520
you're under arrest for murder.

26:15.160 --> 26:18.880
-Is this a bad time?
-They took my statement already.

26:19.640 --> 26:21.080
I saw the same as everyone else.

26:21.680 --> 26:24.080
-May I come in?
-Any news?

26:24.080 --> 26:24.120
-May I come in?
-Any news?
-About what?
-About what happened.

26:24.120 --> 26:26.600
-About what?
-About what happened.

26:27.400 --> 26:30.360
That's exactly what
I wanted to discuss. May I?

26:35.120 --> 26:36.880
Lovely home you have here.

26:38.000 --> 26:40.520
Would you be so kind
as to tell me why you're here?

26:47.920 --> 26:49.240
This is comfy.

26:49.440 --> 26:53.400
A relic from the last century.
The upholstery is a masterpiece.

26:53.560 --> 26:56.280
I prefer a machine-washable
cover myself.

26:56.400 --> 26:57.400
Very practical.

27:00.160 --> 27:03.960
Any idea why Isabel Mora
was at that festival?

27:05.000 --> 27:06.760
-Should I have?
-No.

27:07.160 --> 27:10.000
But it's strange,
because she was at a retreat

27:10.160 --> 27:12.480
and took off suddenly
to go to a concert.

27:13.240 --> 27:15.680
Why do I feel like
I've done something wrong?

27:17.000 --> 27:19.800
-You were at that concert, too.
-That's right.

27:20.720 --> 27:21.720
I'm a music buff.

27:22.760 --> 27:24.000
-Is that a crime?
-No.

27:25.400 --> 27:28.120
-It's a coincidence.
-No, it isn't.

27:29.000 --> 27:30.080
I called her.

27:31.920 --> 27:34.320
I wanted to speak with her
about our daughter.

27:37.880 --> 27:39.240
-Sol is your daughter?
-Yes.

27:40.360 --> 27:42.120
I sent Isabel an invitation.

27:43.360 --> 27:46.760
I wanted a happy, public place,
for the three of us to meet.

27:47.280 --> 27:48.760
Why didn't you say so before?

27:48.960 --> 27:51.960
Because people like me
are always considered guilty.

27:53.040 --> 27:54.680
I have to prove
my innocence time and again.

27:56.480 --> 27:58.720
Even if only to justify
my desperate attempt

27:58.840 --> 28:00.120
to seek forgiveness.

28:01.880 --> 28:03.640
And the chance
to be a good father.

28:04.480 --> 28:06.400
You say you sent her
an invitation.

28:07.160 --> 28:10.120
-How did you know where she was?
-My daughter told me.

28:11.400 --> 28:12.440
You can ask her.

28:13.760 --> 28:15.640
When you spoke to Isabel
on the phone,

28:16.800 --> 28:17.800
did she say anything

28:18.800 --> 28:21.520
-that could explain why...?
-Why she'd kill a man?

28:24.360 --> 28:26.840
Are you putting
someone's delusions on me?

28:30.160 --> 28:31.160
No.

28:33.120 --> 28:34.120
Thank you.

28:46.440 --> 28:49.120
Would you be willing
to undergo a lie-detector test?

28:49.120 --> 28:49.160
Would you be willing
to undergo a lie-detector test?
Just to confirm
what you've told me.

28:49.160 --> 28:51.120
Just to confirm
what you've told me.

28:51.120 --> 28:51.160
Just to confirm
what you've told me.
It's entirely voluntary,
as you know.

28:51.160 --> 28:52.760
It's entirely voluntary,
as you know.

28:53.200 --> 28:54.200
No problem.

28:54.760 --> 28:56.400
-When should I come?
-Right now?

28:57.160 --> 28:58.480
If you could come with me,

28:58.600 --> 29:00.800
it'd be better
at this stage of the case.

29:01.360 --> 29:02.800
-Right now?
-Yes.

29:04.440 --> 29:05.440
Of course.

29:32.000 --> 29:33.000
What's this?

29:34.240 --> 29:35.560
It was among her things.

29:38.000 --> 29:39.000
I HATE YOU

29:39.160 --> 29:40.040
BASTARD

29:40.200 --> 29:41.200
MONSTER

29:41.400 --> 29:43.560
SCUMBAG

29:43.760 --> 29:45.120
I HATE YOU

30:02.160 --> 30:03.160
May I?

30:32.240 --> 30:35.080
Ready. You can go ahead.

30:37.160 --> 30:38.760
Can you tell me
your full name?

30:39.400 --> 30:41.440
Julián López de Haro Osorio.

30:44.160 --> 30:46.080
Did you invite Isabel Mora
to the concert

30:46.080 --> 30:46.160
Did you invite Isabel Mora
to the concert
to resolve an issue
with your daughter?

30:46.160 --> 30:48.720
to resolve an issue
with your daughter?

30:50.280 --> 30:51.280
That's right.

30:53.520 --> 30:54.880
Say yes or no.

30:57.520 --> 30:58.520
Yes.

31:00.960 --> 31:03.080
PHYSIOLOGICAL ACTIVITY SYSTEM

31:05.080 --> 31:06.440
Was that your only intention?

31:11.040 --> 31:12.040
The only one.

31:12.320 --> 31:13.320
Yes or no?

31:15.560 --> 31:16.560
Yes.

31:22.080 --> 31:23.240
Where's my daughter?

31:36.440 --> 31:38.120
You said you weren't
going to kill me.

31:38.320 --> 31:39.520
And I'm not.

31:40.440 --> 31:41.520
She is.

32:09.600 --> 32:11.440
Is it true
Isabel Mora's daughter

32:11.600 --> 32:14.280
got in contact with you
of her own free will?

32:15.000 --> 32:16.000
Yes.

32:44.560 --> 32:45.680
Don't move.

32:46.840 --> 32:49.000
-Put the gun down now.
-I didn't kill anyone.

32:49.000 --> 32:49.080
-Put the gun down now.
-I didn't kill anyone.
-Listen to me.
-Drop the gun.

32:49.080 --> 32:51.040
-Listen to me.
-Drop the gun.

32:51.200 --> 32:52.520
Are you going to shoot me?

32:52.680 --> 32:55.880
This is all Haro's doing
but I can't prove it.

32:56.000 --> 32:58.040
You meant to kill him
and got the wrong guy.

33:02.760 --> 33:05.560
We found the newspaper clippings
in your apartment.

33:07.120 --> 33:09.120
I saw what you wrote
on his photos.

33:11.560 --> 33:12.520
What newspapers?

33:12.720 --> 33:14.960
The wise thing to do
is turn yourself in.

33:15.160 --> 33:17.480
-No.
-Goddammit.

33:19.640 --> 33:22.760
I need your help. Please.

33:23.160 --> 33:25.160
You were under huge stress.

33:25.680 --> 33:28.280
-You could plead insanity.
-I'm not crazy.

33:29.560 --> 33:32.800
Please, don't make this worse.
Give me the gun.

33:34.080 --> 33:35.080
You know me.

33:35.960 --> 33:38.040
How could you think
I'd kill someone?

33:40.080 --> 33:41.360
How?

33:49.640 --> 33:50.640
Okay.

33:51.000 --> 33:54.160
Now what?
What are you going to do?

33:55.360 --> 33:57.640
Are you going to do your duty?
Do it.

33:58.720 --> 34:01.280
You'll be putting
an innocent person behind bars.

34:01.480 --> 34:03.360
I need something to go on.

34:04.120 --> 34:06.680
-You can believe in me.
-No.

34:06.840 --> 34:09.360
-That's not enough for a cop.
-A mediocre cop.

34:09.840 --> 34:13.640
You never could see things
from a different perspective.

34:15.040 --> 34:17.120
Haro has planned all of this.

34:18.080 --> 34:21.600
Everything that's been happening
to me coincides

34:21.720 --> 34:23.160
with him getting out.

34:23.720 --> 34:26.280
That theory
is impossible to prove.

34:26.920 --> 34:29.080
I was knocked out
with chloroform.

34:29.080 --> 34:29.160
I was knocked out
with chloroform.
When I came to,
I had a gun in my hand

34:29.160 --> 34:31.080
When I came to,
I had a gun in my hand

34:31.080 --> 34:31.160
When I came to,
I had a gun in my hand
and Haro wasn't there anymore.

34:31.160 --> 34:32.920
and Haro wasn't there anymore.

34:33.040 --> 34:36.280
But he was the guy
I'd been following.

34:37.040 --> 34:39.240
-You followed him to kill him.
-No.

34:41.120 --> 34:44.640
He called me so I'd go.
He didn't tell you that, right?

34:44.840 --> 34:48.800
Yes, we know that.
And we know Sol is his daughter.

34:49.800 --> 34:51.640
And that he wanted to meet
to talk about her.

34:52.360 --> 34:53.360
No.

34:57.480 --> 34:58.600
Do you believe him?

34:59.200 --> 35:01.360
Haro took a voluntary
lie-detector test.

35:01.960 --> 35:04.960
And he passed.
He's not hiding anything.

35:08.120 --> 35:10.240
Lots of cold-blooded people
can keep a cool head

35:10.360 --> 35:12.320
to pass that test
and keep lying.

35:14.560 --> 35:16.000
-And you know it.
-Enough!

35:16.520 --> 35:17.520
That's enough.

35:18.120 --> 35:19.960
Okay.

35:24.040 --> 35:25.040
Don't help me.

35:27.200 --> 35:28.640
I'll do it on my own.

35:30.920 --> 35:32.000
Let me go.

35:35.240 --> 35:36.440
Let me go.

35:40.080 --> 35:41.600
Nieto, it's me, Abaño.

35:49.120 --> 35:51.640
-What's she doing here?
-She was downstairs.

35:52.600 --> 35:54.400
I just wanted
to see how you were.

35:54.600 --> 35:57.360
With all the Isabel stuff.
You were partners, after all.

35:57.560 --> 35:59.400
Can we leave the visits
for another time?

35:59.600 --> 36:01.400
No. I need to talk to you.

36:01.880 --> 36:04.760
We're in the middle...
of two police investigations.

36:04.920 --> 36:06.480
I'm fine. Thanks for asking.

36:07.560 --> 36:10.240
Any news on Plaza?
Can you give me anything?

36:10.360 --> 36:11.560
No.

36:12.760 --> 36:14.360
-I need to pee.
-Can't you go to a bar?

36:14.520 --> 36:17.280
It's 1am.
Let me use the damn bathroom.

36:21.800 --> 36:24.920
-I'm grabbing a glass of water.
-Can I get you a cold one?

36:25.120 --> 36:26.000
Ideal.

36:27.160 --> 36:28.880
Incredible what happened, right?

36:29.560 --> 36:32.080
-The bathroom's that way.
-Isn't life crazy?

36:35.240 --> 36:39.240
One day you're a normal person
and the next you can kill a man.

36:39.440 --> 36:41.320
Weren't you going
to the bathroom?

36:41.960 --> 36:44.960
Can I get a drink, please?
Anything stronger?

36:46.000 --> 36:47.000
No.

36:48.160 --> 36:49.360
You knew Isabel well, right?

36:53.720 --> 36:56.280
And nothing made you suspect
she could become a killer?

36:58.720 --> 36:59.760
Get out.

36:59.880 --> 37:01.720
Why are you treating me
like shit?

37:02.760 --> 37:04.280
With that air
of moral superiority.

37:04.920 --> 37:07.560
Holding the fact that I revealed
Isabel's past against me.

37:07.720 --> 37:08.880
Who's worse?

37:10.080 --> 37:11.080
Tell me.

37:11.400 --> 37:13.040
All I did was tell the truth.

37:13.560 --> 37:14.600
I haven't killed anyone.

37:16.680 --> 37:19.000
You were better
when you thought with your cock.

37:29.160 --> 37:30.160
I'm tired.

37:31.080 --> 37:33.000
Can we talk
in a few hours' time?

37:33.000 --> 37:33.080
Can we talk
in a few hours' time?
I'm putting my ass on the line
telling you this.

37:33.080 --> 37:35.400
I'm putting my ass on the line
telling you this.

37:35.560 --> 37:37.160
They've tapped your phone.

37:37.680 --> 37:41.120
Isabel is in real deep shit.
Don't go down with her.

37:42.440 --> 37:44.720
-Has she been in touch with you?
-No.

37:46.440 --> 37:49.640
Come on, while you're here,
take the vinyls you lent me.

37:50.400 --> 37:51.480
Okay, great.

37:59.400 --> 38:00.800
We were a good team.

38:01.120 --> 38:03.480
And now Perea's fighting
for his life in the ICU,

38:03.640 --> 38:06.160
Isabel is wanted
and they've tapped your phone.

38:06.720 --> 38:08.120
What's happened to us, man?

38:09.160 --> 38:10.280
It was these, right?

38:12.000 --> 38:13.000
Is that the door?

38:13.200 --> 38:15.120
-Probably the neighbors.
-That's the door.

38:21.920 --> 38:22.920
Goddammit, Nieto.

38:23.360 --> 38:24.560
Alert all units.

38:24.720 --> 38:26.840
Isabel has been seen
in Barrio de las Letras.

39:16.000 --> 39:17.600
Hello. What are you doing?

39:23.560 --> 39:26.160
Nothing, collecting...
chestnuts.

39:27.040 --> 39:29.040
At this time of night?
That's weird.

39:30.000 --> 39:32.000
You shouldn't be out
so late either, right?

39:33.040 --> 39:35.080
I was collecting worms
to go fishing.

39:36.600 --> 39:37.760
-On your own?
-Yes.

39:37.960 --> 39:40.040
I climbed out
of my bedroom window.

39:40.040 --> 39:40.080
I climbed out
of my bedroom window.
-I do it often.
-No.

39:40.080 --> 39:41.160
-I do it often.
-No.

39:41.320 --> 39:43.120
I mean, does anyone
know you're here?

39:44.120 --> 39:46.360
No. I heard a noise
and came to check it out.

39:46.560 --> 39:47.720
There's never anyone here.

39:50.360 --> 39:52.920
There's blood on your shirt.
Did you fall?

39:53.080 --> 39:54.000
Yes.

39:55.000 --> 39:56.680
-Alright. Bye.
-Hold on.

40:14.480 --> 40:15.520
I didn't do anything.

40:16.080 --> 40:17.080
Be careful.

40:17.400 --> 40:18.600
She's armed.

40:20.560 --> 40:22.760
I hardly think she's going
to shoot at us.

40:22.880 --> 40:25.280
-What are you doing here?
-Helping.

40:25.640 --> 40:26.640
Helping who?

40:28.360 --> 40:31.120
I'm on the side of justice.
You shouldn't doubt that.

40:32.240 --> 40:33.960
-You hid her at your place.
-No.

40:34.520 --> 40:36.040
She was there when I got home.

40:36.720 --> 40:38.480
I gave her the chance to do
the right thing,

40:38.640 --> 40:40.000
turn herself in.

40:40.920 --> 40:42.400
I'd have done the same
for you.

40:44.640 --> 40:46.280
Damn, this is bullshit.

40:48.680 --> 40:52.000
Fine, but don't go on your own.
Have someone go with you.

41:27.800 --> 41:28.800
Why?

41:31.760 --> 41:34.800
Shouldn't be out so late, dad.
-Answer me.

41:36.920 --> 41:39.080
Why did you accuse
your mother and I

41:39.080 --> 41:39.120
Why did you accuse
your mother and I
of having abused you?

41:39.120 --> 41:40.840
of having abused you?

41:42.000 --> 41:44.920
Because people need
a justification for evil.

41:47.320 --> 41:49.320
What do you mean?
I don't understand.

41:50.640 --> 41:52.520
Take it easy, you're recovering.

41:56.360 --> 41:58.120
In fact, you started all this,

41:58.280 --> 42:02.800
with all the stuff about giving
my victims my inheritance, etc.

42:04.000 --> 42:07.680
-This is about the inheritance?
-That was the trigger, yes.

42:09.840 --> 42:11.160
I didn't like it at all.

42:14.080 --> 42:15.800
But I have plenty of money.

42:18.120 --> 42:20.680
I need something more
to become what I once was.

42:22.080 --> 42:23.200
Society's forgiveness.

42:24.600 --> 42:27.760
-Forgiveness for what I did.
-They'll never forgive you.

42:27.960 --> 42:29.320
That's where you're wrong.

42:31.400 --> 42:34.880
Evil for evil's sake is
what can never be forgiven.

42:35.080 --> 42:37.120
But that all changes
if you have a reason.

42:39.160 --> 42:40.720
That's where childhood comes in.

42:42.160 --> 42:44.040
That darling era
where everything fits

42:44.160 --> 42:45.480
and nothing can be proven.

42:48.640 --> 42:50.880
You'd throw us to the wolves
to save yourself.

42:51.080 --> 42:53.080
That's the answer
you came looking for.

42:54.960 --> 42:56.160
I won't allow it.

42:58.640 --> 43:00.080
Who are they going to believe?

43:01.600 --> 43:03.160
I'm the victim this time.

43:04.360 --> 43:06.960
And people always side
with victims and children.

43:11.920 --> 43:13.520
Leave your mother out of this.

43:16.680 --> 43:17.680
Say it was me.

43:19.120 --> 43:20.040
But leave her out of it.

43:21.120 --> 43:22.120
No.

43:29.160 --> 43:30.720
It won't have the same impact.

43:46.600 --> 43:47.680
I know you're there.

43:57.760 --> 43:59.400
It had to be you who found me.

44:01.760 --> 44:02.760
Well, there we go.

44:04.280 --> 44:07.400
-This is the end of the line.
-Don't move.

44:14.160 --> 44:15.160
Here.

44:16.000 --> 44:18.240
My car keys.
It's parked where it always is.

44:21.680 --> 44:24.960
If there's the slightest chance
what you're saying is true,

44:26.000 --> 44:27.000
I'm going to prove it.

44:42.480 --> 44:43.560
Hide.

44:52.080 --> 44:53.080
And don't call me.

45:47.000 --> 45:48.280
Don't move.
