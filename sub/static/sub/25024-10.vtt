-[classical music playing]
-[muffled dialogue]

00:18.685 --> 00:21.104
[Merlin]
...if not Gunmar, then another monster.

00:21.187 --> 00:25.442
[Blinky] Let me get this straight.
You want Gunmar to release Morgana?

00:25.525 --> 00:28.862
[Toby] Merlin, I thought you were here
to save the world, not destroy it!

00:28.945 --> 00:32.073
[Merlin] I'm not destroying the world,
I'm risking it!

00:32.156 --> 00:35.618
The world harbors greater dangers,
not just the ones in your little town.

00:35.702 --> 00:38.580
-[Toby] Whoa. What dangers?
-You could not hope to understand.

00:38.663 --> 00:40.206
-[Claire] Jim? Jim?
-[music fades]

00:40.290 --> 00:42.417
-[Claire] Jim!
-[Toby] Want to weigh in here?

00:42.500 --> 00:45.295
Merlin just dropped the bomb
we have to let Morgana loose.

00:45.378 --> 00:47.088
Wait, he destroyed my Vespa.

00:47.172 --> 00:50.592
He what? See? Then you must listen
to the voice of reason. Mine!

00:50.675 --> 00:55.096
Gunmar has the Staff of Avalon.
Soon he will find a way to free her.

00:55.180 --> 00:57.182
This is when we will strike.

00:57.265 --> 00:59.225
Together, we'll slay Morgana

00:59.309 --> 01:02.353
-before the Eternal Night starts.
-[Toby] Whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:02.437 --> 01:06.858
I'm sorry, you want Jim to go up against
Gunmar and Angor Rot and Morgana?

01:06.941 --> 01:09.277
Now is the time to strike.

01:09.360 --> 01:13.239
She's been imprisoned for centuries,
and she will be at her weakest.

01:13.323 --> 01:15.575
-This is our best chance.
-[Claire] Wait.

01:15.658 --> 01:18.411
If Jim defeats Morgana,
you get your magic back.

01:18.578 --> 01:21.081
That would be a pleasant bonus, yes.

01:21.164 --> 01:23.333
Oh, you only want your magic back!

01:23.416 --> 01:26.544
Aaarrrgghh!!!, my friend,
put your fist through the old man's face.

01:26.628 --> 01:30.799
Mmm. Old man make sense.
Stop witch forever.

01:30.882 --> 01:33.510
I'm with Blinky. Sounds like Merlin
wants his magic back.

01:33.593 --> 01:36.429
What if Merlin's right?
He's been right about everything else.

01:36.513 --> 01:37.347
Thank you.

01:37.430 --> 01:41.017
[chuckles] Claire, Gunmar and Morgana
want to destroy the world.

01:41.101 --> 01:42.435
We live in this world!

01:42.519 --> 01:46.648
Yet, this world is protected
by the Trollhunter.

01:46.731 --> 01:48.566
The choice is his to make.

01:48.650 --> 01:50.735
-[Merlin] What say he?
-Uh...

01:52.237 --> 01:55.448
-I need to think.
-Then, I await your decision.

01:55.532 --> 01:58.660
Whatever you choose,
if we are to fight, we'll need an army.

01:58.743 --> 02:00.745
Aaarrrgghh!!! and I will see
what we can do.

02:00.829 --> 02:04.332
As to whom we are fighting,
I'll leave that to Master Jim.

02:05.750 --> 02:07.001
[theme music playing]

02:15.593 --> 02:16.845
[roars]

02:31.526 --> 02:32.986
[roaring]

02:39.492 --> 02:41.953
-[grunts]
-[Gunmar] Stricklander...

02:42.036 --> 02:45.248
Where's Barbara?
I need to know she's all right.

02:45.331 --> 02:47.167
[Gunmar] Such compassion.

02:47.250 --> 02:51.713
You've spent so long pretending
to be a Fleshling, you think you are one.

02:51.796 --> 02:57.010
And now, you pull the strings
of the Trollhunter himself.

02:57.093 --> 02:59.679
Oh, you are clever.

02:59.762 --> 03:03.308
Clever enough not to align with a monster.

03:03.391 --> 03:06.227
What? You think I'm a monster?

03:06.311 --> 03:10.732
-But, Stricklander, I can have compassion.
-[Barbara groaning]

03:10.815 --> 03:12.567
Let go of me!

03:13.026 --> 03:14.569
Barbara!

03:14.652 --> 03:15.987
It will be all right.

03:16.529 --> 03:18.740
You must do whatever he says.

03:20.116 --> 03:21.576
[growls]

03:21.659 --> 03:24.329
The Staff of Avalon.

03:24.412 --> 03:29.125
If you unlock the Heartstone
and liberate your Eldritch Queen,

03:29.834 --> 03:32.503
you will be rewarded.

03:32.587 --> 03:38.051
He promises to not hurt anyone in Arcadia.
Save my son, Strickler.

03:38.468 --> 03:41.221
[exhales] Barbara always called me Walter.

03:41.304 --> 03:42.889
Usurna!

03:44.432 --> 03:45.266
[growls]

03:45.350 --> 03:47.477
I told you that wouldn't work.

03:47.560 --> 03:50.855
Now where is Barbara Lake?

03:50.939 --> 03:53.399
[Barbara] This is Dr. Lake.
I'm not available.

03:53.483 --> 03:55.944
-Please leave a message...
-Thanks. Call me if you do.

03:56.027 --> 03:58.488
-My mom hasn't seen her either.
-Not at the hospital.

03:58.571 --> 04:00.490
Asking for Mommy's permission?

04:00.573 --> 04:04.619
You're asking us to wage a war.
It's only fair to have everyone weigh in.

04:04.702 --> 04:08.539
I'm feeling a bit peckish.
Where do you keep your fresh haggis?

04:08.623 --> 04:12.919
What sort of cannibal wizard hungers
for boiled meat in a sheep's stomach?

04:13.002 --> 04:15.755
Ugh! I'll see if anyone at the school
has seen her.

04:16.255 --> 04:17.507
[both grunt]

04:17.589 --> 04:19.591
-[Toby] Jeez, don't you knock?
-Nomura!

04:19.676 --> 04:21.177
-[Nomura coughs]
-[Toby screams]

04:21.261 --> 04:23.888
Blood.
There's blood on the rug and it's purple!

04:23.972 --> 04:25.306
-[groans]
-What happened?

04:25.390 --> 04:27.809
Usurna tried to capture me at the museum.

04:28.685 --> 04:33.356
Gunmar needs a Changeling
to activate the Staff of Avalon.

04:33.439 --> 04:36.067
So he found a way around my safeguard.

04:36.150 --> 04:39.612
He needs human hands
who can speak in a troll tongue.

04:40.071 --> 04:43.199
If they failed to take her,
they'll look for others.

04:43.283 --> 04:45.868
-Strickler.
-Do you think your mom is with him?

04:46.703 --> 04:49.622
[Strickler] Hello, caller. I'm sorry
I'm not in. If you could...

04:49.706 --> 04:51.124
We don't know she was with him.

04:51.207 --> 04:53.584
Split up and search everywhere!
Find my mother!

04:53.668 --> 04:56.421
-Uh...
-It's okay. We'll find them, Jim.

04:56.504 --> 04:58.464
-Uh, hey, Nomura.
-[Nomura grunts]

04:58.548 --> 05:00.758
Your shoulder, it looks... [gulps]

05:00.842 --> 05:04.137
-Is it falling out?
-Aah! [screams]

05:04.220 --> 05:05.054
[chuckles]

05:05.888 --> 05:09.225
There's no stopping Gunmar now.
I'm gonna get ready to fight.

05:09.309 --> 05:12.687
-We'll call if we find anything.
-[gasps]

05:12.770 --> 05:14.605
-[Toby mumbling]
-[gasps]

05:21.946 --> 05:23.656
For the Glory of Merlin...

05:26.993 --> 05:28.453
I can't let you intervene.

05:28.536 --> 05:31.080
But if Gunmar has Strickler,
he might have my mother.

05:31.164 --> 05:32.957
That is a risk we have to take.

05:33.041 --> 05:34.876
You know she's with Gunmar.

05:34.959 --> 05:38.880
And Gunmar needs Strickler
to unlock the Staff of Avalon.

05:38.963 --> 05:42.925
Better to liberate Morgana now
so we can defeat her.

05:43.009 --> 05:46.012
So you can get your magic back.
That's all you care about.

05:46.095 --> 05:47.597
-[typing]
-What are you doing?

05:47.680 --> 05:49.474
Texting Toby to meet me at the canals.

05:49.557 --> 05:52.185
If my mom is in Trollmarket,
we're getting her out.

05:52.268 --> 05:57.231
I don't know what sorcery
this texting is, but I do not like it.

05:57.940 --> 05:59.275
-[gasps]
-[beeps]

05:59.358 --> 06:04.072
You didn't know it could do that, did you?
I did. I made it.

06:04.155 --> 06:07.325
You might have built it,
but it's still mine to command!

06:07.408 --> 06:08.993
For the Glory of Merlin!

06:12.997 --> 06:16.084
Step away from the door, old man.

06:22.256 --> 06:24.759
Who are you calling "old"?

06:25.635 --> 06:27.345
I think the butler did it.

06:27.428 --> 06:29.597
Grabbing my helmet, Nana.
Trollhunter busi...

06:29.680 --> 06:34.102
I may be blind, but even I can spot
a red herring a mile away.

06:34.185 --> 06:38.189
Toby Pie, have you seen
Mr. Meow Meow P.I.?

06:38.272 --> 06:41.067
[belches] I haven't seen anything.

06:41.150 --> 06:44.946
I'll add Mr. Meow Meow P.I.
to the missing list, Nana.

06:45.029 --> 06:50.076
My troll compatriots,
we cannot remain divided!

06:50.159 --> 06:51.702
The juncture has arrived

06:51.786 --> 06:55.581
-to coalesce as one and fight as brethren!
-[Gatto growls]

06:55.665 --> 06:56.916
[both gasp]

06:57.792 --> 07:01.003
You speak with words bigger
than your mouth.

07:01.087 --> 07:06.884
I enjoy a good riddle,
but I have no idea what you just said.

07:06.968 --> 07:07.927
War coming.

07:08.010 --> 07:10.596
We need help from everyone
in the troll lands.

07:10.680 --> 07:15.351
Gunmar has the power to release Morgana
and bring forth the Eternal Night.

07:15.435 --> 07:17.895
Merlin has returned to allow it.

07:17.979 --> 07:19.772
Merlin's alive?

07:19.856 --> 07:23.609
If he has returned,
then this is the end of days!

07:23.693 --> 07:30.074
Hmm, I have no interest in human affairs
unless they're dinner guests.

07:30.158 --> 07:33.661
[laughs]

07:33.744 --> 07:36.622
As trolls, we must band together!

07:36.706 --> 07:40.168
[scoffs]
Like you have the trolls in Arcadia?

07:40.251 --> 07:43.713
Riddle me this: what has six eyes,

07:43.796 --> 07:47.758
four arms and is the joke of trollkind?

07:47.842 --> 07:51.471
I will give you a hint. One letter: U!

07:51.554 --> 07:54.682
-Good hint.
-I get it, I'm not well-liked.

07:54.765 --> 07:57.477
Are you so ignorant
to assume you're safe here?

07:57.560 --> 08:01.314
Gunmar won't stop with the surface lands.
One day, he will come for you.

08:01.397 --> 08:04.567
True, but if I throw my lot in
with you fools,

08:04.650 --> 08:06.944
I am as good as dead today.

08:07.028 --> 08:10.823
It appears our reinforcements
will be found elsewhere.

08:12.492 --> 08:13.493
[growls]

08:15.828 --> 08:18.039
Barbara! Barbara!

08:19.665 --> 08:21.167
Walter!

08:34.804 --> 08:37.517
[Gunmar] The Trollhunter's mother.

08:42.188 --> 08:43.022
[roars]

08:45.191 --> 08:46.150
[sniffs]

08:46.234 --> 08:52.907
Huh, brave woman.
But the brave are often the first to die.

08:54.909 --> 08:56.786
Don't do it, Walt. Don't do it!

08:56.869 --> 08:59.872
If I activate the Staff, you'll let us go?

08:59.956 --> 09:02.208
I'll let the woman go.

09:02.291 --> 09:07.213
No! No, Walt! Please don't.
My life is not worth the world!

09:07.630 --> 09:09.632
It is to me.

09:17.223 --> 09:18.224
[grunts]

09:18.307 --> 09:22.103
What kind of man are you to stop me
from saving my own mother?

09:22.186 --> 09:26.566
[grunts] A man who has seen centuries.
You aren't old enough to understand.

09:27.316 --> 09:28.985
[grunting]

09:37.243 --> 09:39.704
I was battling evil
when the world was still young.

09:39.787 --> 09:40.913
[grunts]

09:42.623 --> 09:45.251
-[man on TV] You're more than a...
-A talking crystal!

09:47.920 --> 09:52.133
If you can't defeat me,
what hope do you have of defeating Gunmar?

09:52.216 --> 09:53.884
I thought you said I had a choice.

09:53.968 --> 09:58.097
Not a choice whether to fight,
but how to fight.

09:58.180 --> 10:02.518
The Changeling tried to teach you,
but you're too young and foolish to learn.

10:02.602 --> 10:06.522
The Eclipse Blade is not enough
to vanquish Gunmar!

10:10.860 --> 10:13.529
-[grunts]
-Your humanity is not enough!

10:15.656 --> 10:20.828
You are not enough!
No one will survive this war unscathed!

10:21.287 --> 10:23.289
You're a real jerk, you know that?

10:23.372 --> 10:26.542
Yes, but that doesn't make me wrong.

10:27.293 --> 10:30.421
-Forgive me. You leave me no choice.
-[shrieks]

10:34.884 --> 10:37.762
My troll compatriots,
we cannot remain divided!

10:37.845 --> 10:42.558
The juncture has arrived
to coalesce as one and fight as brethren!

10:43.601 --> 10:48.189
[chuckles] Toby here?
Sweet Toby come back?

10:48.272 --> 10:51.067
-Is there someone else we can speak with?
-[Wumpas chanting]

10:52.568 --> 10:58.908
Wonder if you'd come back, we did.
Trollmarket fell, my eyes did see.

10:58.991 --> 11:03.120
You're safe now. We are here.
Let us unite and combat Gunmar.

11:03.204 --> 11:04.288
Hmm?

11:05.373 --> 11:09.502
-Perhaps I have been too loquacious.
-[Wumpa chanting continues]

11:13.214 --> 11:16.926
You are safe now. We are here.

11:17.009 --> 11:21.597
We'll make Gunmar disappear! Aah!

11:21.680 --> 11:22.932
[Aaarrrgghh!!! chanting]

11:23.015 --> 11:25.393
Oh, forget it. We need your help.

11:25.476 --> 11:27.812
None of us can stand against Gunmar alone.

11:27.895 --> 11:30.523
-This I know to be true.
-[groans]

11:30.606 --> 11:32.817
Sorry is Wise Wumpa.

11:32.900 --> 11:37.696
-But for protection, a deal I have made.
-What deal?

11:40.241 --> 11:43.536
-Hello, Aaarrrgghhaumont.
-[growls]

11:47.039 --> 11:48.624
[growls]

11:55.631 --> 11:58.217
[Merlin] You were supposed to be
my champion.

11:59.009 --> 12:02.304
-You tied me up?
-I'm opening your eyes.

12:02.388 --> 12:03.764
You're worse than Gunmar.

12:03.848 --> 12:06.434
At least he doesn't pretend
to care about the world.

12:06.517 --> 12:11.105
I care. I do.
I just see the bigger picture.

12:11.188 --> 12:15.818
For instance, that wasn't a wild
goose chase I sent you on yesterday.

12:15.901 --> 12:19.321
These ingredients hold a greater purpose.

12:23.868 --> 12:28.873
-Hmm. "Food Magic 3000"?
-[blender whirring]

12:28.956 --> 12:31.500
Ah! That really is magic.

12:32.293 --> 12:35.963
-What purpose?
-To turn you into a troll.

12:36.505 --> 12:41.385
-You want to turn me into a troll?
-Actually, half-troll.

12:41.469 --> 12:46.056
Consider this recipe my way
of evening the odds.

12:47.099 --> 12:50.686
-I'm not drinking that.
-Oh, you won't be consuming it.

12:52.730 --> 12:54.648
If this old man could overpower you,

12:55.107 --> 12:58.903
what do you think Gunmar
or Angor Rot will do?

12:59.028 --> 13:02.198
You must pour the elixir into water.

13:02.281 --> 13:07.036
Submerge yourself in said water
and, presto!

13:07.119 --> 13:10.498
You will be born anew.

13:11.373 --> 13:13.918
But why me?

13:15.503 --> 13:16.337
[sighs]

13:19.381 --> 13:20.508
Your heart.

13:21.300 --> 13:26.305
I once had a heart as pure as yours,
I believe.

13:26.472 --> 13:30.935
In my rest, I saw a way
to finally end this stalemate.

13:31.018 --> 13:35.981
To win this war, I must have a champion
with a foot in both worlds.

13:36.065 --> 13:38.609
-I thought you said I had a choice!
-You do.

13:38.692 --> 13:43.280
The Amulet chose you
to become the first human Trollhunter,

13:43.364 --> 13:45.866
but you were never destined to remain so.

13:46.200 --> 13:48.285
To protect the world you love,

13:48.369 --> 13:51.622
to be the champion
for both humans and trolls,

13:51.705 --> 13:54.792
you need to be more than human.

13:54.875 --> 13:59.088
You need to become both Troll and Hunter.

14:01.840 --> 14:04.593
How long would I be like this?

14:05.636 --> 14:09.223
Alas, there is no going back.

14:09.723 --> 14:15.938
Part of you will remain Jim,
but the other part will never be the same.

14:17.022 --> 14:23.028
If you really want to save your mother,
your friends, this world you call home...

14:23.112 --> 14:25.155
You're asking me to leave it all behind?

14:25.489 --> 14:32.121
James, I know this is the greatest call
anyone has ever asked of you.

14:34.999 --> 14:36.000
Huh?

14:36.083 --> 14:39.461
-You untied me?
-I never tied you.

14:39.795 --> 14:44.466
I was opening your eyes.
I said the choice was yours.

14:44.550 --> 14:46.093
And there it lies.

14:53.934 --> 14:56.645
[Merlin] This is that choice.

15:10.492 --> 15:14.330
-None of your games, Stricklander.
-Please, Walt, don't!

15:15.039 --> 15:18.167
I'm sorry. May the world forgive me.

15:18.334 --> 15:21.378
For without you, there is no world!

15:22.588 --> 15:23.881
No, Walter.

15:28.260 --> 15:31.597
Plo ex effr dan Morgana...

15:31.680 --> 15:33.724
-[Barbara] Please, Walt.
-[clears throat]

15:33.807 --> 15:38.187
Kloka kwema foni xi brusen.

15:54.203 --> 15:55.287
Ah!

15:57.414 --> 16:01.752
Don't look, Barbara! Keep your eyes shut!

16:03.754 --> 16:05.547
[grunts]

16:08.801 --> 16:12.513
-No! After them!
-[growling]

16:18.352 --> 16:20.896
The Eternal Night is...

16:31.657 --> 16:33.826
[gasps]

16:54.346 --> 16:57.683
The Eternal Night is here!

17:11.613 --> 17:13.866
[Merlin] Pour the elixir into water.

17:14.074 --> 17:19.163
Submerge yourself in said water
and, presto.

17:19.246 --> 17:22.290
You will be born anew.

17:28.672 --> 17:29.923
[both grunt]

17:34.678 --> 17:36.263
[gasps] Seriously?

17:42.561 --> 17:44.521
-Walt, we're trapped.
-[grunts]

17:45.647 --> 17:48.192
What are you doing? They're coming!

17:50.819 --> 17:52.863
[both grunting]

17:55.991 --> 17:56.825
[growls]

17:58.452 --> 18:00.037
-[car horn honks]
-[gasps]

18:00.788 --> 18:03.207
[Toby] Dr. L! Are you okay?

18:03.290 --> 18:06.335
-We have to warn Jim.
-Morgana, she's free.

18:06.418 --> 18:08.003
-[gasps]
-Jim!

18:10.089 --> 18:12.007
[phone buzzing]

18:25.521 --> 18:29.983
[Merlin] You need to become
both Troll and Hunter.

18:34.196 --> 18:37.116
You need to be more.

18:40.327 --> 18:42.871
For the Glory of Merlin,

18:43.539 --> 18:44.373
Daylight...

18:44.456 --> 18:46.834
is mine to command.

18:51.296 --> 18:53.340
[electricity buzzes]

18:54.925 --> 18:57.678
[Jim] What the heck was I thinking?

18:57.761 --> 18:58.846
[roars]

18:59.638 --> 19:02.349
An amulet can't choose anyone.
It's an amulet!

19:02.432 --> 19:06.186
Master Jim, despite whatever doubts
you may have about the Amulet's choice,

19:06.270 --> 19:08.605
it is now bonded to you.

19:09.481 --> 19:11.817
[Blinky]
This is a mantle you cannot refuse.

19:11.900 --> 19:14.069
[phone buzzing]

19:18.907 --> 19:19.741
[Toby] Jim!

19:20.325 --> 19:21.160
[Claire gasps]

19:21.827 --> 19:22.744
Where's Jim?

19:22.828 --> 19:25.956
Finally becoming a true Trollhunter.

19:26.039 --> 19:26.957
You'd never!

19:30.252 --> 19:31.920
-[thudding]
-Jim!

19:35.132 --> 19:37.551
Jim? Are you in there?

19:38.802 --> 19:43.223
I want you to know something.
Even before you found this Amulet,

19:43.307 --> 19:45.559
way before all of this,

19:46.393 --> 19:48.937
you were always my hero.

19:49.855 --> 19:51.857
My beautiful boy.

19:51.940 --> 19:55.235
Jim! What's happening? Please let us in!

19:55.319 --> 19:56.570
Are you okay?

19:56.653 --> 19:58.071
[Jim] I'm fine, Mom.

19:58.155 --> 19:59.865
You don't need to protect me.

19:59.948 --> 20:02.826
[Jim]
I think this is what I was meant to do.

20:02.910 --> 20:03.744
[Toby] Jimbo?

20:03.827 --> 20:09.291
[Jim] For the doom of Gunmar,
Eclipse is mine to command!

20:09.875 --> 20:12.711
[Toby] Come on, Jimbo, we're a team!
Don't do this!

20:12.794 --> 20:17.633
I'm sorry.
I have to finish the fight! Alone.

20:17.716 --> 20:18.592
[Claire] Jim!

20:18.675 --> 20:19.843
[Jim] Claire.

20:19.927 --> 20:20.928
[Claire] Jim!

20:21.011 --> 20:22.137
[knocking on door]

20:25.599 --> 20:29.061
[Jim] For the Glory of Merlin...
where are you?

20:30.145 --> 20:33.815
[Merlin] My Amulet does not make mistakes.

20:33.899 --> 20:34.733
[Claire] Jim!

20:35.943 --> 20:42.032
[Merlin] And of all creatures
in our worlds, I chose you!

20:42.115 --> 20:44.284
[Claire] Jim, they've freed Morgana!

20:45.202 --> 20:47.037
[Jim] I thought you said I had a choice.

20:47.829 --> 20:52.000
[Merlin] A choice not whether to fight,
but how to fight.

20:52.751 --> 20:58.966
If you really want to save your mother,
your friends, I am asking you to change.

20:59.049 --> 21:03.595
Young Atlas, you are not alone.
Don't do this! Open the door!

21:03.679 --> 21:08.475
[Blinky] Master Jim, never forget
that fear is but the precursor to valor,

21:08.558 --> 21:14.690
that to strive and triumph in the face
of fear is what it means to be a hero.

21:14.773 --> 21:16.900
[Merlin] There is no going back.

21:16.984 --> 21:22.155
Part of you will remain Jim,
but the other part will never be the same.

21:23.824 --> 21:24.950
[Barbara] Jim!

21:25.826 --> 21:26.868
Jim?

21:29.246 --> 21:31.832
-[Barbara] Jim?
-[heartbeat thudding]

21:32.249 --> 21:33.625
[muffled] Jim!

21:48.181 --> 21:51.685
What's happened to my son?
Where is my son?

21:55.772 --> 21:58.150
[heartbeat thumping]

22:06.325 --> 22:09.244
-[heartbeat thumping softly]
-[breath echoing]
