WEBVTT

00:01.610 --> 00:03.394
Previously onDynasty...Is this a bad idea?

00:03.438 --> 00:04.569
I'm in the mood for a bad idea.

00:09.531 --> 00:10.749
Fletcher is married.

00:10.793 --> 00:12.403
He was lying to me the
whole time we dated.

00:12.447 --> 00:13.926
What the hell are
you doing here?

00:13.970 --> 00:15.102
Didn't Blake tell you?

00:15.145 --> 00:17.017
I'm moving in, dear.

00:27.462 --> 00:28.680
What the hell is this?

00:28.724 --> 00:31.205
Why are we having swamp
water for breakfast?

00:31.248 --> 00:32.641
And why don't I
smell crepes?

00:32.684 --> 00:34.121
DOMINIQUE:
Because you're smelling

00:34.164 --> 00:36.079
wellness!

00:36.123 --> 00:37.689
Good morning, roomies.

00:37.733 --> 00:39.039
I thought a
heart-healthy

00:39.082 --> 00:40.910
meal would be better
for all of us.

00:40.953 --> 00:43.608
Okay, I'd like to discuss
some house rules,

00:43.652 --> 00:47.134
since I wasn't exactly consulted
before your arrival.

00:47.177 --> 00:48.787
The deal we made
for her getting me

00:48.831 --> 00:50.833
access to Jeff's office
was one year,

00:50.876 --> 00:54.054
nonnegotiable, but we
will hardly see her,

00:54.097 --> 00:56.099
because she also agreed
to lay low in the east wing.

00:56.143 --> 00:58.275
Isn't that right, Dominique?
And I'll be sure

00:58.319 --> 00:59.972
to add an addendum
that you are no longer

01:00.016 --> 01:01.974
allowed to speak
to the kitchen staff.

01:02.018 --> 01:03.237
Hmm. Oh!

01:03.280 --> 01:05.717
Excuse me, I have a very

01:05.761 --> 01:07.154
important meeting.

01:07.197 --> 01:08.807
See? It's almost like
I wasn't here.

01:08.851 --> 01:10.113
"Almost."

01:10.157 --> 01:11.462
Wow.

01:11.506 --> 01:13.029
30 seconds in and I already
want to kill her.

01:13.073 --> 01:14.552
I don't know
if I can make it a year.

01:14.596 --> 01:16.815
You are underestimating
how remarkable you are.

01:16.859 --> 01:18.121
If you could move past

01:18.165 --> 01:19.557
all that Alexis crap
like you did,

01:19.601 --> 01:21.255
Dominique will be
a walk in the park.

01:21.298 --> 01:24.127
I don't like walking
in the park with a snake.

01:24.171 --> 01:26.782
I...

01:26.825 --> 01:28.349
I have to take this.

01:28.392 --> 01:31.003
I'll be right back.

01:37.184 --> 01:38.794
Gunnerson!

01:38.837 --> 01:41.144
Bring me some bacon!

01:41.188 --> 01:43.625
Liam, you and I have

01:43.668 --> 01:45.192
endured and overcome

01:45.235 --> 01:47.498
so many insane obstacles.

01:47.542 --> 01:49.674
And by insane,
I mean your mother.

01:49.718 --> 01:52.199
But I have never been more sure

01:52.242 --> 01:55.289
that I am ready to spend
the rest of my life

01:55.332 --> 01:58.118
by your side and in your arms.

01:58.161 --> 02:00.250
So, Liam...

02:00.294 --> 02:03.166
will you marry me?

02:03.210 --> 02:05.255
Yes, Liam will marry you.

02:05.299 --> 02:06.343
And if he doesn't, I will.

02:06.387 --> 02:07.649
I mean, look at this ring.

02:07.692 --> 02:10.652
Aw, I am touched
by your materialism.

02:10.695 --> 02:12.306
But I would lose the
one knee thing if I were you.

02:12.349 --> 02:13.524
It feels dated.

02:13.568 --> 02:15.526
What? No, no, there's
no time to tinker.

02:15.570 --> 02:17.746
I am doing this
at dinner tonight.

02:17.789 --> 02:19.530
Liam. Liam! Liam!
Get rid of it.

02:19.574 --> 02:20.575
My mouth? Okay.

02:20.618 --> 02:21.880
What's better
than a good sweat?

02:21.924 --> 02:23.360
FALLON:
Uh... aw, man.

02:23.404 --> 02:25.188
I can't think
of anything better.

02:25.232 --> 02:27.321
SAM:
I actually haven't
had a good sweat in ages.

02:27.364 --> 02:30.889
Hey, Siri, remind me
to sweat later.

02:30.933 --> 02:31.890
Good call.
Yeah.

02:31.934 --> 02:32.935
You two seem weird.

02:32.978 --> 02:35.198
BOTH:
Weird? No...

02:35.242 --> 02:36.199
Excited, yes.

02:36.243 --> 02:37.244
Yeah.
Yeah.

02:37.287 --> 02:38.288
About the hotel.

02:38.332 --> 02:39.289
SAM:
It's, um...

02:39.333 --> 02:40.421
Sold out!

02:40.464 --> 02:41.639
It's sold out for the...For the night.

02:41.683 --> 02:43.032
...rest of the time.

02:44.164 --> 02:46.992
So, are we still on for tonight?

02:47.036 --> 02:49.778
Yes, we are, um, but do you
think you could possibly,

02:49.821 --> 02:51.780
I don't know,
wash off the sweat

02:51.823 --> 02:53.085
before then?
Why?

02:53.129 --> 02:54.304
Why, you don't like this?

02:54.348 --> 02:56.785
No? Little bit?

02:56.828 --> 02:59.614
Okay.

02:59.657 --> 03:01.311
Whew! Okay, bye.

03:01.355 --> 03:03.183
No! Hey.

03:04.793 --> 03:06.882
Fine.

03:11.321 --> 03:13.584
Is that good?It's a little more aggressive
than I'm used to.

03:13.628 --> 03:15.847
But I like it.

03:18.502 --> 03:20.330
Hello, Mother.

03:20.374 --> 03:21.679
Shouldn't you knock
before walking in

03:21.723 --> 03:23.681
on your mother with
your stepfather?

03:23.725 --> 03:25.292
Lesson learned.

03:25.335 --> 03:27.119
Still, what a
pleasant surprise.

03:27.163 --> 03:28.295
Are you here for
just a visit?

03:28.338 --> 03:30.732
I doubt it.Are you hungry?

03:30.775 --> 03:33.387
Definitely not hungry,
but, um...

03:33.430 --> 03:34.779
I do need some help.

03:34.823 --> 03:37.042
Oh, well, hold on
while I look surprised.

03:37.086 --> 03:39.523
What do you need?So, my license

03:39.567 --> 03:41.917
with the state medical board
is up for review,

03:41.960 --> 03:43.179
as it is
every six months.

03:43.223 --> 03:45.790
And Blake was making these...

03:45.834 --> 03:47.270
"donations"

03:47.314 --> 03:48.315
to keep it legit.

03:48.358 --> 03:50.621
By "donations,"
you mean "bribes"?

03:50.665 --> 03:54.277
Semantics, but now that I've
fallen out of favor with Father,

03:54.321 --> 03:55.931
those have stopped,
so I...

03:55.974 --> 03:58.325
I need some money

03:58.368 --> 04:00.675
or I won't be able to practice
as a doctor in Atlanta.

04:00.718 --> 04:03.330
Well, sounds like a big win
for the patients of Atlanta.

04:04.331 --> 04:05.549
How much are
we talking?

04:05.593 --> 04:06.985
Not a lot, like...

04:07.029 --> 04:09.858
100,000-- I'd...
I'd really appreciate it.

04:09.901 --> 04:11.686
Fine, I'll do it.

04:12.556 --> 04:15.646
Really? No, not really.

04:15.690 --> 04:19.302
You poisoned me, so let me
amend my response to

04:19.346 --> 04:20.608
hell no.

04:20.651 --> 04:22.566
Not a penny, son.

04:24.307 --> 04:26.962
Being a parent's kind of fun.

04:30.357 --> 04:31.575
Enjoy.

04:31.619 --> 04:34.535
I call it House of Deveraux.

04:34.578 --> 04:39.279
A fabulous, sexy reality show
featuring myself, naturally,

04:39.322 --> 04:41.368
and my rising star daughter,

04:41.411 --> 04:43.848
Vanessa, all shot
in my new home,

04:43.892 --> 04:45.197
Carrington Manor.

04:45.241 --> 04:46.460
It's very, um,

04:46.503 --> 04:48.462
Kardashian/Jenner-like.

04:48.505 --> 04:49.724
But with singing.

04:50.768 --> 04:52.074
And me.

04:52.117 --> 04:54.032
Hmm, I'm thinking about it...

04:54.076 --> 04:55.295
but I'm not liking it.

04:55.338 --> 04:58.210
You produce a lot
of these shows, Stacey.

04:58.254 --> 05:00.125
This will be huge.

05:00.169 --> 05:02.127
You know who's gonna tune in
to see you

05:02.171 --> 05:04.129
and your unknown daughter?

05:04.173 --> 05:05.174
No one.

05:05.217 --> 05:07.176
Now, maybe

05:07.219 --> 05:09.309
Blake Carrington
could be a hot name

05:09.352 --> 05:11.136
coming off of his
murder trial.

05:11.180 --> 05:13.443
And people seem
to be very interested

05:13.487 --> 05:15.315
in his stunning new bride.

05:15.358 --> 05:18.448
Unfortunately, Cristal and I
aren't exactly besties.

05:18.492 --> 05:20.058
Well, neither are
the housewives.

05:20.102 --> 05:22.496
But they are juicy
and salacious.

05:22.539 --> 05:24.367
Show me a sizzle reel.

05:24.411 --> 05:27.283
A side to Cristal Carrington
no one knows about.

05:28.328 --> 05:30.460
I get it.

05:30.504 --> 05:32.332
So, when Fletcher gets here,
I'm gonna throw one of these

05:32.375 --> 05:34.246
drinks in his face for not
telling me he was married.

05:34.290 --> 05:35.509
Why hasn't Adam texted me yet?

05:35.552 --> 05:37.206
This one will sting more.

05:37.249 --> 05:38.512
This one will stain more.

05:38.555 --> 05:40.383
And that one just
tastes nasty.

05:40.427 --> 05:41.471
So, what do you think?

05:41.515 --> 05:42.690
We had amazing sex.

05:42.733 --> 05:44.474
What's this guy's deal?I could salt the rim

05:44.518 --> 05:47.216
of this mojito for more bite.

05:47.259 --> 05:49.174
Kirby?

05:49.218 --> 05:50.350
Focus.

05:50.393 --> 05:52.787
Wait, I'm sorry,
you invited Fletcher here

05:52.830 --> 05:54.528
to throw a drink
in his face?

05:54.571 --> 05:56.268
You're not really
the drink-throwing type.

05:56.312 --> 05:58.401
I know.

05:58.445 --> 06:01.535
Hi... Sam.

06:01.578 --> 06:03.493
Fletcher.

06:03.537 --> 06:05.495
Just let me explain.

06:06.670 --> 06:08.672
Yes. I'm married.

06:08.716 --> 06:10.457
But we have
an open marriage

06:10.500 --> 06:13.111
and my husband knows everything.

06:13.155 --> 06:14.852
There was
no cheating.

06:14.896 --> 06:16.201
I just didn't

06:16.245 --> 06:17.507
know how to tell you,
because some people

06:17.551 --> 06:18.726
have a problem with it.

06:20.467 --> 06:22.947
Well, I didn't see that coming.

06:22.991 --> 06:24.949
Kirby?

06:24.993 --> 06:26.298
Don't you have
somewhere to be?

06:26.342 --> 06:28.518
Oh, no, not really.

06:28.562 --> 06:29.954
Look, I can't
stay anyway.

06:29.998 --> 06:31.608
I just wanted to tell you
the truth in person.

06:33.131 --> 06:35.743
And to ask if you're

06:35.786 --> 06:37.397
still interested
in seeing each other?

06:42.053 --> 06:43.620
That seems like a good idea.

06:45.361 --> 06:48.103
Great, I... I'll call you later.

06:48.146 --> 06:49.844
Okay.

06:49.887 --> 06:51.454
Bye.
Bye.

06:51.498 --> 06:52.673
Bye, Fletcher!

06:52.716 --> 06:54.152
That's a terrible idea.

06:54.196 --> 06:58.418
Oh, says the genius
who slept with Adam Carrington?

07:00.898 --> 07:02.422
FALLON:
Okay, Liam will be here

07:02.465 --> 07:03.988
any minute-- when he gets here,

07:04.032 --> 07:05.990
he will sit down,
tell me how great I look

07:06.034 --> 07:07.209
and order a drink.
At that point,

07:07.252 --> 07:08.863
I will propose, he will say yes,

07:08.906 --> 07:10.778
and on my cue,
you will start playing.

07:10.821 --> 07:12.344
Mm-hmm.Okay? You got that?

07:12.388 --> 07:13.607
Yes?

07:13.650 --> 07:15.173
Okay, okay, he's here. Go hide.

07:15.217 --> 07:17.437
Okay.Go hide faster!

07:17.480 --> 07:18.786
Hey, look at you

07:18.829 --> 07:21.136
all clean and sweat-free.

07:21.179 --> 07:22.964
Really? 'Cause
I'm kind of freakin' out.

07:23.007 --> 07:24.356
Oh, no, don't.
You smell great.

07:24.400 --> 07:25.662
What? No. No, no, no.

07:25.706 --> 07:27.403
But I just got huge news.

07:27.447 --> 07:29.187
Mm-hmm.I have an opportunity
to pitch a book idea

07:29.231 --> 07:31.102
to one of the most important
publishers in the world.

07:31.146 --> 07:32.495
Wow! Wow, that is great news.

07:32.539 --> 07:35.498
And I can't wait to talk
about it in 15 minutes.

07:35.542 --> 07:37.544
Could we just
get you a drink?Yeah, that's the problem.

07:37.587 --> 07:39.546
The publisher's in London,
so I have to fly out tomorrow.

07:39.589 --> 07:41.504
So, what's the problem?

07:41.548 --> 07:42.679
I need a rain check on tonight,

07:42.723 --> 07:44.115
'cause I have
so much to do.

07:44.159 --> 07:46.509
I need to pack,
flesh out my idea, write notes.

07:46.553 --> 07:48.119
And this has to happen
tomorrow?

07:48.163 --> 07:49.686
I know it's sudden,
but they're insisting.

07:49.730 --> 07:51.122
It's an opportunity
that I can't pass up.

07:51.166 --> 07:54.082
Okay, it's fine.
Whatever. Go.

07:54.125 --> 07:55.823
Oh, also, I'd...

07:55.866 --> 07:57.041
love to borrow the jet.

07:57.085 --> 07:58.652
So, do you think
you could set that up for me

07:58.695 --> 08:00.567
while I get ready?
You should come with me.

08:00.610 --> 08:02.569
No, no. That's fine.

08:02.612 --> 08:05.006
I will just...
wait until you get back.

08:05.049 --> 08:06.660
Wait?

08:06.703 --> 08:07.704
Oh, to...

08:07.748 --> 08:09.663
congratulate you, silly.Okay, well,

08:09.706 --> 08:10.751
I got to run, so...Mm-hmm.

08:10.794 --> 08:13.057
Think on it?Okay, I will.

08:17.627 --> 08:20.325
Not the gesture.

08:30.510 --> 08:32.555
I mean, the obvious move is
to wait for Liam to get back

08:32.599 --> 08:33.687
and then propose
to him then.

08:33.730 --> 08:35.689
Because it has
to be perfect. Right?

08:35.732 --> 08:37.255
Totally.

08:37.299 --> 08:39.867
So, for my date
with Fletcher,

08:39.910 --> 08:41.695
I'm thinking of wearing
this kind of an...

08:41.738 --> 08:43.392
"Open marriage?
Who cares?" vibe.

08:43.435 --> 08:46.047
But there's also this...

08:46.090 --> 08:48.919
"I'm obviously hotter
than your husband" deal.

08:49.746 --> 08:51.661
I'm legit torn.
Can you help me?

08:51.705 --> 08:54.142
Maybe I'm putting
too much pressure on myself.

08:54.185 --> 08:55.578
It doesn't have
to be a perfect

08:55.622 --> 08:56.623
storybook proposal, you know?

08:56.666 --> 08:58.363
Every time
I go for a fairy tale,

08:58.407 --> 08:59.626
it ends up being a disaster.

08:59.669 --> 09:01.018
I mean, we're like
Hansel and Gretel,

09:01.062 --> 09:03.412
except if the witch
actually ate them in the end,

09:03.455 --> 09:04.892
and then got food poisoning.

09:04.935 --> 09:07.677
Okay, I think you should
totally go to London with him.

09:07.721 --> 09:09.374
I mean, he clearly
wants you to,

09:09.418 --> 09:11.507
and it's not like you have
anything else to do here.

09:11.551 --> 09:13.291
Interesting.

09:13.335 --> 09:15.685
I guess I could go with him
and find the perfect moment

09:15.729 --> 09:17.165
to propose.

09:17.208 --> 09:20.385
I could take him
to my favorite chocolate shop

09:20.429 --> 09:22.605
in the world and
propose to him there.

09:22.649 --> 09:24.694
Chocolate shop?
Who are you, Willy Wonka?

09:24.738 --> 09:26.043
I could even propose
on the plane.

09:26.087 --> 09:27.218
That's interesting.

09:28.219 --> 09:29.569
Okay, so, um...

09:29.612 --> 09:30.700
which outfit?

09:30.744 --> 09:32.702
For what?
Where are you going?

09:32.746 --> 09:35.400
You are seriously
theworst friend.

09:35.444 --> 09:36.750
Oh, please.

09:36.793 --> 09:38.621
Last night you
wanted to marry me.

09:38.665 --> 09:41.450
Top from A, bottom from B,
and we're gonna need an option C

09:41.493 --> 09:43.539
for the shoes.Really?

09:44.888 --> 09:46.586
Anders.

09:46.629 --> 09:48.413
I've been looking
everywhere for you.

09:48.457 --> 09:50.415
You found me.
Well done.

09:50.459 --> 09:51.634
Now, if you
don't mind...

09:51.678 --> 09:53.593
I do mind.
I need some advice on Cristal.

09:53.636 --> 09:56.726
How can I befriend her,
get her to really open up to me?

09:56.770 --> 09:58.510
I'm not sure
that's possible.

09:58.554 --> 10:00.643
Also, I would consider
helping you...

10:00.687 --> 10:02.427
but I don't trust you.

10:02.471 --> 10:04.429
No need to trust.

10:04.473 --> 10:06.736
I just want to be friends
with my sister-in-law.

10:06.780 --> 10:07.955
So let's say
I wanted to arrange

10:07.998 --> 10:09.652
a special dinner for her.

10:09.696 --> 10:10.958
What would that
look like?

10:11.001 --> 10:12.786
Does she have a strong feeling
about kale?

10:12.829 --> 10:14.657
Mrs. Carrington's
feelings about kale

10:14.701 --> 10:16.790
are hers and hers alone.

10:16.833 --> 10:18.792
Classic Anders.

10:18.835 --> 10:20.837
You're like a field general--

10:20.881 --> 10:22.796
unflappable in battle

10:22.839 --> 10:24.754
and always the smartest man

10:24.798 --> 10:26.364
in the room.

10:26.408 --> 10:28.497
That's why I've had
a secret crush on you for years.

10:29.541 --> 10:30.978
I was unaware.

10:31.021 --> 10:33.067
Well, now you know... General.

10:33.110 --> 10:34.503
At ease, Soldier.

10:34.546 --> 10:37.201
If you do want to
have this dinner,

10:37.245 --> 10:39.813
Mrs. Carrington has an
affinity for roasted pork.

10:39.856 --> 10:42.598
May I please go about
my business now?

10:42.642 --> 10:43.686
Of course.

10:46.515 --> 10:47.777
Whoa!

10:47.821 --> 10:48.865
We're going for one night.

10:48.909 --> 10:51.694
Hey, you never know
what could happen.

10:51.738 --> 10:54.001
We could have a reason
to celebrate and stay longer.

10:54.044 --> 10:55.785
Celebrate?

10:55.829 --> 10:58.005
Oh. You know,
if they buy your book idea.

10:58.048 --> 10:59.615
Are you okay?

10:59.659 --> 11:02.792
I've just never seen you be
so giddy about my career.

11:02.836 --> 11:04.489
Even when you
were my publisher.

11:05.665 --> 11:08.232
But it feels nice
to be supported.

11:08.276 --> 11:10.800
No. Well, I am
always supportive.

11:10.844 --> 11:13.020
Sometimes it's just
a little less obvious.

11:14.151 --> 11:15.675
But I think
this trip is gonna be

11:15.718 --> 11:17.285
a memorable one
for both of us.

11:20.288 --> 11:22.290
Let's go to London.

11:31.778 --> 11:33.997
FLETCHER:
I got three local affiliates

11:34.041 --> 11:36.478
to cover the
event, plus HGTV.

11:37.784 --> 11:39.742
And then I hit
a nun with a taxi.

11:39.786 --> 11:41.309
What?

11:41.352 --> 11:43.746
Is everything okay?

11:43.790 --> 11:44.791
No.

11:44.834 --> 11:47.663
I can't stop thinking
of your husband.

11:47.707 --> 11:51.493
Hey, look, I assure you my
husband is not thinking of you.

11:51.536 --> 11:53.843
No offense. And the open
marriage was his idea.

11:53.887 --> 11:56.803
But I'm-I'm...
fine with it.

11:56.846 --> 11:58.718
Are you positive?

11:58.761 --> 12:02.025
I am. Yeah, it works.

12:02.069 --> 12:04.201
Can you tell me
what time it is?

12:04.245 --> 12:05.768
Aren't you wearing a watch?

12:05.812 --> 12:08.031
I'd rather hear you say it.

12:14.777 --> 12:16.605
What is this?

12:16.648 --> 12:17.954
Oh.

12:17.998 --> 12:20.348
Wow.

12:22.524 --> 12:23.960
This is beautiful.

12:25.396 --> 12:27.007
Thank you.

12:29.531 --> 12:31.620
For everything.

12:34.841 --> 12:36.799
JENNINGS:
Dominique?

12:36.843 --> 12:38.192
Welcome home, Cristal.

12:38.235 --> 12:40.629
Okay, that's a little creepy.

12:40.672 --> 12:42.805
I just wanted
to document tonight.

12:42.849 --> 12:45.939
I thought you might be hungry
from your long trip,

12:45.982 --> 12:48.419
so I catered in
a small feast for us.

12:48.463 --> 12:51.205
It's from the best
barbecue joint in Atlanta.

12:51.248 --> 12:54.425
We have pork ribs and
pulled pork and smoked sausages

12:54.469 --> 12:57.472
and even... pigs
in a blanket for fun.

12:57.515 --> 12:58.865
What the hell is going on here?

12:58.908 --> 13:00.475
I want us
to spend time together.

13:00.518 --> 13:04.479
And after dessert, I brought in
the dream team of beauticians.

13:04.522 --> 13:06.960
We can get manis
and pedis and waxing

13:07.003 --> 13:08.483
together,
just like sisters.

13:08.526 --> 13:10.441
This is all insane.

13:11.399 --> 13:13.053
Plus, I'm allergic to pork.

13:13.096 --> 13:15.707
What?I need to get out of here.
I have to go lie down.

13:15.751 --> 13:17.535
How about
on those massage tables?

13:17.579 --> 13:19.799
We could get a couples massage
and chat?

13:22.410 --> 13:25.108
So this is nice, right?

13:25.152 --> 13:28.155
I... would like to make a toast

13:28.198 --> 13:30.984
to you... Liam.

13:31.027 --> 13:32.986
Actually, hold that
thought, save the toast.

13:33.029 --> 13:33.987
I got a better idea.

13:34.030 --> 13:35.423
I'm pretty sure you don't.

13:35.466 --> 13:36.641
No, this is perfect.

13:36.685 --> 13:37.817
I need to practice my pitch.

13:37.860 --> 13:39.427
All right,
this project could be

13:39.470 --> 13:41.821
life-changing for me, and I...
I need to nail it in the room.

13:41.864 --> 13:44.345
Mm-hmm.And since we're gonna
be here for a while, I mean,

13:44.388 --> 13:45.520
why not do it now, right?

13:45.563 --> 13:46.913
It's so perfect.

13:46.956 --> 13:48.958
Okay, so any feedback
is appreciated-- characters,

13:49.002 --> 13:50.568
plot, anything.

13:50.612 --> 13:53.397
I'm starting to wish
I was in coach.Okay. Yeah. Sorry.

13:53.441 --> 13:55.617
I'll start.

13:57.010 --> 13:58.925
It started on a day
like any other.

14:00.622 --> 14:03.538
I was tying up loose ends
on a nasty espionage case

14:03.581 --> 14:05.409
when a rich nightclub owner
showed himself in

14:05.453 --> 14:06.889
like he owned the place.

14:06.933 --> 14:10.110
They say you're a pretty good
private detective, Leland.

14:10.153 --> 14:12.068
Some say I'm the best, pal.

14:12.112 --> 14:13.461
Some say you werethe best.

14:13.504 --> 14:16.464
Well, some say...
Okay, we could do this all day.

14:16.507 --> 14:19.423
Get to the point.There was a jewelry heist
at my nightclub.

14:19.467 --> 14:21.469
Since I'd rather not
have the cops involved,

14:21.512 --> 14:23.079
I want you on the case.

14:23.123 --> 14:25.690
I know you andyour nightclub,
Mr. Sanders.

14:26.604 --> 14:28.128
I'm not interested in the case.

14:28.171 --> 14:31.305
A P.I. turning down a case?
Not something you see every day.

14:31.348 --> 14:32.784
Yeah, well, I got my reasons.

14:32.828 --> 14:35.265
There's not a damn thing
you can do to change my mind.

14:35.309 --> 14:37.528
We'll see about that.

14:37.572 --> 14:38.747
Blaine, get in here!

14:38.790 --> 14:39.879
Tout de suite!

14:39.922 --> 14:41.097
Sorry, sir.

14:41.141 --> 14:42.533
I didn't hear you at first.

14:42.577 --> 14:44.884
Get a hearing aid.Yeah.

14:44.927 --> 14:47.495
Please change
the gentleman's mind.

14:47.538 --> 14:48.713
Oh, yeah.

14:48.757 --> 14:50.890
Uh...

14:54.589 --> 14:56.591
Where's your mind at
now, Leland?

14:59.028 --> 15:01.726
Nice plate of greens is good
for a man's diet.

15:02.684 --> 15:04.207
I'm on the case.

15:09.909 --> 15:13.521
That Peach Diamond
is priceless. It's my baby.

15:13.564 --> 15:16.567
I want you to nab the thief
and return Kirby to me.

15:17.307 --> 15:18.961
It's what I call the diamond.

15:19.005 --> 15:20.702
Oh.

15:20.745 --> 15:23.183
So you put the diamond

15:23.226 --> 15:25.098
in the safe in your office.

15:25.141 --> 15:27.100
And then the power goes out.

15:35.238 --> 15:36.500
SANDERS: I'll bet my last buffalo nickel

15:36.544 --> 15:38.981
it was the new busboy,
Aidan, that stole it.

15:39.025 --> 15:40.243
He's more suspicious

15:40.287 --> 15:41.549
than a three-legged cat,

15:41.592 --> 15:43.594
and he skipped town
right after the robbery.

15:43.638 --> 15:45.379
Well, it's always an inside job.

15:45.422 --> 15:46.902
Except when it isn't.

15:46.946 --> 15:48.512
How much is your fee again?

15:48.556 --> 15:49.774
I'll ask the questions, Sanders.

15:49.818 --> 15:51.951
Such as,
why'd you keep such a hot rock

15:51.994 --> 15:53.778
in your club
instead of your home safe?

15:53.822 --> 15:55.780
I don't trust anybody there,
either.

15:55.824 --> 15:58.131
Right.

15:58.174 --> 16:01.134
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome
to the fabulous Club Sanders.

16:01.177 --> 16:03.136
Magic is in the air
every night here,

16:03.179 --> 16:06.443
but tonight, my friends,
the magic is real.

16:06.487 --> 16:09.229
So I'm gonna need
you beautiful people to show

16:09.272 --> 16:11.231
some deep love
to the extravagant,

16:11.274 --> 16:13.885

16:45.743 --> 16:47.702
but it was a doozy.

16:47.745 --> 16:51.749
Veronica, the one
I gave my heart to,

16:51.793 --> 16:53.882
only to have her chew it up,
spit it out,

16:53.925 --> 16:55.101
kick it to the curb

LELAND:
Every drop of blood
in my veins told me

17:42.539 --> 17:44.628
to bolt out of there
and never look back,

17:44.672 --> 17:47.979
but my eyes
wouldn't let me leave,

17:48.023 --> 17:49.633
and my heart started
ripping through my shirt.

17:58.642 --> 18:00.383
LIAM:
So, how do you like it

18:00.427 --> 18:04.474
so far?Well, I have to be honest.
It was a little meh at first.

18:04.518 --> 18:05.997
But then,
the lounge singer came in,

18:06.041 --> 18:07.173
and it got much more exciting.

18:07.216 --> 18:08.435
Okay, just wait.

18:08.478 --> 18:10.567
Mm-hmm. Hmm.

18:15.181 --> 18:18.662
LELAND:
I knew I had to interview
everyone in the joint,

18:18.706 --> 18:21.361
so I stopped staring
and started talking.

18:21.404 --> 18:24.015
Sure I was drinking here
that night,

18:24.059 --> 18:26.148
but I have no alibi,

18:26.192 --> 18:28.977
because I come and go a lot.

18:29.020 --> 18:32.154
No one ever recognizes my face.

18:32.198 --> 18:35.244
Been slinging cocktails here
forever.

18:35.288 --> 18:37.986
I'd never steal
from my boss, Sanders.

18:38.029 --> 18:40.206
He's always been so good to me,

18:40.249 --> 18:43.470
especially
when I've been so bad.

18:43.513 --> 18:45.559
I see everything
from up here on stage.

18:45.602 --> 18:48.344
So you want to know who I saw
slinking around that night

18:48.388 --> 18:49.998
the lights went out in Georgia?

18:50.041 --> 18:51.608
No one,
'cause it was pitch black.

18:51.652 --> 18:53.480
You're never gonna
find that diamond.

18:53.523 --> 18:56.309
Where was I at the time?

18:56.352 --> 18:58.746
Easy. I was, uh,
moving the boss's car.

18:59.834 --> 19:01.357
Filling it with gas.

19:01.401 --> 19:03.664
Hmm.

19:04.708 --> 19:06.710
Happy to see you, Leland.

19:06.754 --> 19:08.625
I know you'll
dig for the truth

19:08.669 --> 19:10.279
and prove
the busboy didn't do it.

19:10.323 --> 19:11.933
Because Aidan's my brother,

19:11.976 --> 19:13.369
and he's being
framed like

19:13.413 --> 19:16.111
a Monet... or a Manet.

19:16.155 --> 19:17.591
I didn't know you had a brother,

19:17.634 --> 19:21.421
Veronica, or such
a sweeping knowledge of art.

19:22.857 --> 19:24.250
I'd like to chat with Aidan.

19:24.293 --> 19:26.382
Well, of course you would,
but you can't.

19:26.426 --> 19:29.080
You see, he's hiding out
until the real thief is caught.

19:29.124 --> 19:30.908
It's too hot
for him here.

19:30.952 --> 19:32.693
You're looking good.

19:34.303 --> 19:35.870
For whatever it's worth.

19:35.913 --> 19:38.307
The last time you told me I was
looking good was two seconds

19:38.351 --> 19:40.266
before you slammed the door
on my grill.

19:41.789 --> 19:43.443
But I'm still gonna crack
this case.

19:44.879 --> 19:46.446
But for now,
maybe we keep our distance.

19:47.534 --> 19:49.623
FALLON: Why is he being so rude to her?

19:49.666 --> 19:53.235
I mean, it's clear that
the singer is the hero,

19:53.279 --> 19:55.106
and the P.I. should be
treating her like one.

19:55.150 --> 19:56.238
Okay, so you're invested
in the story.

19:56.282 --> 19:58.240
Mm-mm. Uh...

19:58.284 --> 20:00.068
Just keep going.

20:01.330 --> 20:03.289
So, tell me, Lexi.

20:03.332 --> 20:05.682
No one remembers seeing you
at your husband's club

20:05.726 --> 20:07.423
the night the Peach Diamond
was poached.

20:07.467 --> 20:09.686
Believe me, darling.

20:09.730 --> 20:12.167
If I had been there, they'd
all remember seeing me.

20:12.211 --> 20:14.300
This is a face you don't forget.

20:14.343 --> 20:15.953
Right.

20:15.997 --> 20:17.433
So, where were you that night?

20:17.477 --> 20:19.218
I was in bed, of course.

20:19.261 --> 20:20.654
I can take you upstairs

20:20.697 --> 20:23.091
if you'd like to... touch it.

20:23.134 --> 20:25.659
I'm a little
chilly right now.

20:25.702 --> 20:27.356
Well, if you want
to get toasty...

20:28.705 --> 20:32.318
...why don't you take
a step closer to the fire?

20:32.361 --> 20:34.929
I don't do well with fire,
mister.

20:34.972 --> 20:38.324
But I'm really good at
conducting body heat.

20:38.367 --> 20:40.935
LELAND:
I didn't have time
for hanky-panky.

20:40.978 --> 20:42.589
I don't have time
for hanky-panky.

20:42.632 --> 20:45.548
Sal! Little Joe!

20:45.592 --> 20:47.724
Get this bum out of here.

20:47.768 --> 20:50.336
No need, ma'am.
This bum will show himself out.

20:50.379 --> 20:52.512
But the next time you get cold?

20:52.555 --> 20:55.036
Try a light sweater.

20:59.519 --> 21:01.912
Hey. Why don't we
take a stroll, pal.

21:01.956 --> 21:03.262
Maybe have a little chat.

21:03.305 --> 21:05.525
Easy. I bruise
like a baby peach.Aw.

21:05.568 --> 21:07.657
Then I'm thinking you don't show
your face around here no more.

21:07.701 --> 21:09.659
Yeah, and I'm wondering
what else you two gentlemen

21:09.703 --> 21:13.097
do around here
besides rough up innocent P.I.s.

21:13.141 --> 21:14.577
Actually, I handle
accommodations.

21:14.621 --> 21:17.363
So if you ever need
a place to stay,

21:17.406 --> 21:19.016
I can give you my card.

21:19.060 --> 21:21.671
And I, uh, deal
with Mr. Sanders' vehicles.

21:21.715 --> 21:23.499
See, cars are kind of my thing.

21:23.543 --> 21:25.675
Well, something's
puzzling me because...

21:25.719 --> 21:27.329
No, don't!

21:27.373 --> 21:28.548
Relax.

21:28.591 --> 21:30.463
Just gonna water
these petunias.

21:30.506 --> 21:34.293
Okay. That's not what I thought
you were gonna say about that.Hey, pal.

21:36.599 --> 21:38.209
I trust my beak,

21:38.253 --> 21:40.037
and something about you
doesn't smell right.

21:40.081 --> 21:42.910
I didn't lay a hand
on the boss's jewels.Maybe not,

21:42.953 --> 21:44.520
but you laid them
all over the boss's wife,

21:44.564 --> 21:46.174
didn't you?What?

21:46.217 --> 21:48.350
That meathead Little Joe says he
runs the show on Sanders' cars.

21:48.394 --> 21:49.830
So one plus two
means you lied

21:49.873 --> 21:51.397
to me about where you were
the other night.

21:52.354 --> 21:53.399
You weren't at a gas station.

21:53.442 --> 21:55.401
Yeah. And how'd you know

21:55.444 --> 21:57.011
I was banging the boss's wife?

21:57.054 --> 21:59.230
I didn't until you just said it.

21:59.274 --> 22:01.407
Guess I got
a little lucky there, huh?

22:01.450 --> 22:03.104
Eh, not as lucky as me.

22:03.147 --> 22:05.106
You've seen Lexi.
She's a knockout.

22:05.149 --> 22:06.890
I can't imagine being

22:06.934 --> 22:09.153
married to her,
but hell of a sidepiece, right?

22:09.197 --> 22:10.416
FALLON:
Wait.

22:10.459 --> 22:12.418
What?I'm just trying
to add some flavor.

22:12.461 --> 22:16.160
I am starting to get confused,
which is not the ideal flavor

22:16.204 --> 22:17.901
you want to leave your
audience with. Can you just

22:17.945 --> 22:19.381
tell me who stole
the Peach Diamond

22:19.425 --> 22:21.862
so that this can be over
and I can tell you my story?

22:21.905 --> 22:23.951
My story with the
happiest ending ever

22:23.994 --> 22:25.169
where everything makes sense?

22:25.213 --> 22:27.171
Sounds amazing.
But not yet.

22:27.215 --> 22:29.870
Because things are
about to get crazy in mine.

22:45.799 --> 22:46.930
LELAND:
The last time something

22:46.974 --> 22:48.192
this hot was
in my office was when

22:48.236 --> 22:49.759
my portable wok exploded.

22:49.803 --> 22:53.023
Funny me, thinking the lock
on my door keeps people out.

22:53.067 --> 22:54.590
Well, my key's still good,

22:54.634 --> 22:57.201
so I let myself in.

22:57.245 --> 22:58.681
If I come up
with any more questions

22:58.725 --> 23:00.422
about the case,
I'll knock on your door.

23:00.466 --> 23:01.858
But now,

23:01.902 --> 23:03.251
feel free to use that one.

23:03.294 --> 23:04.557
Oh,

23:04.600 --> 23:06.907
I'm not here to talk
about the case, Leland.

23:06.950 --> 23:10.432
But it doesn't take
a detective to know

23:10.476 --> 23:13.087
that you got tossed around
like a rag doll.

23:13.130 --> 23:16.786
Sometimes I wish I had amnesia
so I could forget you existed.

23:16.830 --> 23:18.788
Tell me, Detective.

23:18.832 --> 23:21.922
Do you remember... this?

23:26.622 --> 23:28.015
That top lip rings a bell.

23:28.058 --> 23:30.147
Try the bottom. They're twins.

23:34.021 --> 23:35.979
BLAINE:
Leland. It's me, Blaine.

23:36.023 --> 23:38.721
I just remembered something,
something big.

23:38.765 --> 23:40.941
I need to talk to you tonight.

23:40.984 --> 23:42.812
You know what?

23:42.856 --> 23:46.033
I just realized that I've
forgotten a few details

23:46.076 --> 23:47.774
about you.

23:47.817 --> 23:49.776
How'd you like
to jog my memories?

23:57.871 --> 23:59.829
LIAM:
Whoa, hey, there.

23:59.873 --> 24:01.918
I think

24:01.962 --> 24:03.877
the story is in great shape.

24:05.661 --> 24:07.620
I'm totally feeling
the characters.

24:09.099 --> 24:11.841
But what I want to be feeling
is the author.

24:14.931 --> 24:16.933
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.What?

24:16.977 --> 24:18.500
No, no, we can't have sex yet.

24:18.544 --> 24:19.936
We're almost

24:19.980 --> 24:21.721
in London, and I need
to finish telling the story.

24:23.766 --> 24:26.029
Fine. Just keep it sexy,

24:26.073 --> 24:27.857
pick up the pace
and skip to the end.

But I was there
to get dirt out of Blaine,

25:00.020 --> 25:01.891

Lousy night either way.

25:43.585 --> 25:45.544
Except now I knew who did it.

25:45.587 --> 25:47.110
I am locking it down, people!

25:48.982 --> 25:51.811
Nobody leaves.Uh, should I keep singing?

25:51.854 --> 25:54.204
Nobody sings.

25:54.248 --> 25:57.077
There was a serious crime here,
and I know who did it.

25:57.120 --> 25:59.035
The diamond heist?

25:59.079 --> 26:00.863
Or the murder?

26:00.907 --> 26:02.473
The murder seems bigger.

26:02.517 --> 26:04.998
Oh, please. People get murdered
left and right around here.

26:05.041 --> 26:08.349
I was hired to catch a thief,
and that's what I'm gonna do.

26:08.392 --> 26:10.612
It was the busboy, Aidan.

26:10.656 --> 26:12.527
That's a lie!

26:12.571 --> 26:14.573
He's gone,
and he's never coming back.

26:14.616 --> 26:17.967
Or did he come back
to tie up loose ends?

26:18.011 --> 26:19.926
What, you don't see him?

26:19.969 --> 26:21.710
Maybe he's the invisible man.

26:22.755 --> 26:24.147
Or woman.

26:28.587 --> 26:31.067
No!WOMAN: The baby!

26:32.068 --> 26:33.983
It was a doll?

26:35.332 --> 26:38.031
Poison!
I'd bet five bucks on it.

26:38.074 --> 26:40.033
Five whole bucks?

26:40.076 --> 26:42.426
Get your mitts off me.
I did nothing, you hear?

26:42.470 --> 26:44.124
We're gonna take
you in. But first,

26:44.167 --> 26:46.735
we're gonna take you out.Got to make sure
justice gets served.

26:46.779 --> 26:49.216
Oh! I'll never let them

26:49.259 --> 26:51.348
strap you to that mean,
old electric chair.

26:51.392 --> 26:54.177
Not my brother.

26:57.137 --> 26:58.660
LELAND:
She was gone.

26:58.704 --> 27:00.270
For good.

27:01.271 --> 27:04.187
AIDAN:
Wait. Wait, no.

27:05.493 --> 27:08.670
LELAND:
Smart move
taking a plane, Veronica.

27:09.715 --> 27:11.107
Sure, a bus is cheaper.

27:11.151 --> 27:13.153
A train's
more clickety-clack romantic,

27:13.196 --> 27:16.286
but they don't make you
disappear like that.

27:17.374 --> 27:19.115
What are you doing here, Leland?

27:19.159 --> 27:20.900
You picking your mom up?

27:20.943 --> 27:22.162
Well, hopefully,

27:22.205 --> 27:23.598
you'll get lucky, and
her plane'll crash.

27:23.642 --> 27:25.600
First you manipulated
your brother

27:25.644 --> 27:26.732
to steal the Peach Diamond

27:26.775 --> 27:28.298
for you.

27:28.342 --> 27:30.126
Then you manipulated
Sanders to hire me,

27:30.170 --> 27:32.389
intending the trail
to lead right to Aidan.

27:33.782 --> 27:36.742
You're even crazier than
shorts with high heels.

27:36.785 --> 27:38.874
You had to have Blaine killed
when he learned the truth,

27:38.918 --> 27:40.484
which is why
you told Aidan to come back.

27:41.529 --> 27:43.226
But why would your brother

27:43.270 --> 27:44.793
ax Blaine for you?

27:44.837 --> 27:46.795
Simple.

27:46.839 --> 27:48.275
He's not your brother.

27:49.537 --> 27:51.017
He's your lover!

27:51.060 --> 27:53.193
That bastard.

27:53.236 --> 27:54.498
Did he tell you that?

27:54.542 --> 27:56.718
He didn't have to.
I saw the look on his face

27:56.762 --> 27:58.067
when you gave him
the ole "see you later."

27:58.111 --> 28:00.983
I'd recognize
that look anywhere.

28:01.027 --> 28:02.289
It's the look I saw on my face

28:02.332 --> 28:03.769
when you gave me
the ole "see you later."

28:03.812 --> 28:05.988
Well, that makes no sense.
You can't see your own face.

28:06.032 --> 28:07.468
I'm assuming
that's how I looked, okay?

28:07.511 --> 28:09.122
The point is,

28:09.165 --> 28:10.427
like Aidan,

28:10.471 --> 28:13.256
I would've killed for you
at one point, too.

28:14.780 --> 28:17.913
You think you know everything,
but you know nothing.

28:17.957 --> 28:19.088
The only thing I don't know

28:19.132 --> 28:20.786
is what you did
with the Peach Diamond.

28:22.788 --> 28:25.704
Wouldn't happen to be
in that handbag, would it?

28:32.928 --> 28:35.670
I caught you red-handed.

28:37.063 --> 28:40.066
Peach-handed.

28:40.109 --> 28:41.328
You got to listen
to me, Leland.

28:41.371 --> 28:43.330
I can change.

28:43.373 --> 28:45.288
And that rock's
worth millions.

28:45.332 --> 28:47.377
Let's run away together.

28:48.727 --> 28:51.338
Me and you, baby,
till the end of time.

28:51.381 --> 28:53.775
LELAND:
I was torn.

28:53.819 --> 28:56.691
I wanted to believe her,
but she'd lied to me

28:56.735 --> 28:57.953
over and over again.

28:57.997 --> 28:59.302
So many times.

28:59.346 --> 29:00.564
Repeatedly.

29:15.666 --> 29:17.668
You're a bigger fool than Aidan.

29:17.712 --> 29:19.758
And he's a big fool.

29:19.801 --> 29:20.976
Huge.

29:22.456 --> 29:24.284
Goodbye, Leland.

29:25.720 --> 29:27.374
I'll see you in hell.

29:34.511 --> 29:36.383
I removed the bullets, Veronica.

29:37.906 --> 29:39.386
So who's the huge fool now?

29:39.429 --> 29:42.345
Rhetorical question
implying you're the huge fool.

29:42.389 --> 29:44.173
No. No!

29:44.217 --> 29:46.088
LELAND:
It wasn't the ending I chose

29:46.132 --> 29:47.611
but the one that chose me.

29:47.655 --> 29:48.874
Unlucky.

29:50.353 --> 29:51.572
Well, look at that.

29:51.615 --> 29:53.530
Your pitch lasted
the entire flight.

29:53.574 --> 29:55.228
So? What'd you think?

29:55.271 --> 29:57.665
Uh, yeah, I thought it was...
it was good.

29:57.708 --> 29:59.275
Good? That's it?

30:00.624 --> 30:01.887
Fallon, my pitch is in an hour.

30:01.930 --> 30:04.019
Okay, well, tiny thought.

30:04.063 --> 30:06.587
Maybe postpone it a few weeks

30:06.630 --> 30:08.284
or, I don't know, a year.

30:08.328 --> 30:09.459
Why?

30:09.503 --> 30:11.244
Well, honestly,

30:11.287 --> 30:13.333
it didn't make sense
in a lot of places.

30:13.376 --> 30:14.377
Okay, like where?

30:14.421 --> 30:15.857
Like everywhere.

30:15.901 --> 30:17.990
I mean, how did the P.I.
suddenly figure everything out?

30:18.033 --> 30:19.992
Why was Aidan in a dress?

30:20.035 --> 30:21.776
And were Sal
and Little Joe cops,

30:21.820 --> 30:23.386
or were they security guards?

30:23.430 --> 30:25.345
I don't know.
It was all very confusing.Well, I don't agree.

30:25.388 --> 30:26.607
Oh, and another thing?

30:26.650 --> 30:28.478
You made Veronica way
too manipulative.

30:28.522 --> 30:30.785
You know what?
The story's solid.

30:30.829 --> 30:32.439
I just think you
didn't understand it.

30:32.482 --> 30:34.223
Excuse me?

30:34.267 --> 30:36.660
It's a complex story. Maybe you
just weren't able to follow it.

30:36.704 --> 30:40.099
Well, I'm following
that you're calling me dumb

30:40.142 --> 30:43.232
right now.Not dumb. Just an
unsophisticated reader.

30:43.276 --> 30:44.930
Look, you can't be great
at everything. It's fine.

30:44.973 --> 30:46.409
You know what?

30:46.453 --> 30:48.672
Go pitch your stupid story,

30:48.716 --> 30:51.240
but do not come crying to me
when they "chew it up

30:51.284 --> 30:53.329
and spit it out. Twice."

30:58.726 --> 31:01.685
Fletcher's married, Sam. How
could he possibly be serious

31:01.729 --> 31:04.253
about you, the person
he's not married to?

31:04.297 --> 31:07.822
Well, my, uh, new,
insanely beautiful watch

31:07.866 --> 31:09.215
says pretty serious to me.

31:09.258 --> 31:11.826
Mm. "I can't give you
my undivided love,

31:11.870 --> 31:13.784
so I'll give you
a sparkly timepiece."

31:13.828 --> 31:15.743
Can you please
just be supportive?

31:15.786 --> 31:17.658
I really care about him,

31:17.701 --> 31:19.660
and I'm pretty sure that the
whole open marriage situation

31:19.703 --> 31:20.922
won't last long,

31:20.966 --> 31:22.793
which means
that the marriage won't, either.

31:22.837 --> 31:25.361
Fletcher's probably...

31:25.405 --> 31:26.928
totallygonna leave
his husband.

31:26.972 --> 31:28.451
He said this?

31:28.495 --> 31:31.106
Or is this just what
you're hoping will happen?Kirby,

31:31.150 --> 31:33.674
I think I'm falling in love
with him.

31:34.936 --> 31:36.720
And I think he's falling in love
with me, too.

31:44.511 --> 31:45.468
Congratulations.

31:45.512 --> 31:47.688
You fooled the
hell out of me

31:47.731 --> 31:50.212
with that whole
"Cristal loves pork" thing.

31:50.256 --> 31:52.301
Oh. Must have slipped my mind
that she's allergic.

31:52.345 --> 31:54.825
I should've known better than
to try to get info on Cristal

31:54.869 --> 31:56.523
from such a loyal man.

31:58.220 --> 32:00.135
Is there something
I can help you with?

32:00.179 --> 32:03.095
Have Mrs. Gunnerson prepare you
a sandwich?

32:03.138 --> 32:06.794
Do I look like the type of
person who would eat a sandwich?

32:06.837 --> 32:09.710
No, I'm going upstairs to
take Cristal some champagne.

32:09.753 --> 32:13.627
Nothing says bonding better
than Cristal and Dom.

32:13.670 --> 32:15.934
Clever.

32:15.977 --> 32:18.893
I'll see you in 20.

32:22.375 --> 32:25.682
Well, I guess
I'll see you in 21.

32:25.726 --> 32:27.423
ALEXIS:
I'm sorry, Adam.

32:27.467 --> 32:29.208
I did everything I could to get
Jeff to give you the money.

32:29.251 --> 32:30.600
It's fine.

32:30.644 --> 32:33.342
I hated the idea of owing him
anything anyway, so...

32:33.386 --> 32:35.736
The great news is
Jeff and I have a plan.

32:35.779 --> 32:37.085
And once it
goes perfectly,

32:37.129 --> 32:38.521
I will have more
than enough money

32:38.565 --> 32:41.176
to buy you a license
in Georgia, Montana.

32:41.220 --> 32:44.310
Hell, I'll buy you a
license in all 50 states.

32:44.353 --> 32:45.441
That's very sweet, Mother.

32:45.485 --> 32:47.487
But that sounds
like it'll take time.

32:47.530 --> 32:49.837
My plan is ready to go.

32:49.880 --> 32:51.447
Do tell.So,

32:51.491 --> 32:53.362
I'm gonna sell the vineyard
I bought for Blake

32:53.406 --> 32:55.016
and use that money
to pay off whomever

32:55.060 --> 32:56.061
to get my medical license back.

32:56.104 --> 32:58.846
Isn't the vineyard Blake's?

32:58.889 --> 32:59.847
But the deed's in my name.

32:59.890 --> 33:01.022
We never changed it.

33:01.066 --> 33:02.589
So what are you waiting for?

33:02.632 --> 33:04.156
So, while the deed is
in my name,

33:04.199 --> 33:06.549
it's also in Blake's office.

33:06.593 --> 33:08.116
In the manor.

33:08.160 --> 33:09.204
Which I'm banned from.

33:09.248 --> 33:11.119
But if I can just get
my hands on it,

33:11.163 --> 33:13.034
then Blake would have
no recourse when I sell.

33:13.078 --> 33:16.211
Well, maybe there's
something I cando.

33:16.255 --> 33:17.343
Nah.

33:17.386 --> 33:19.345
I said "recourse,"
not "intercourse."

33:47.155 --> 33:50.419
Somebody has a secret lover.

33:57.035 --> 33:58.427
KIRBY:
Playing hide-and-seek?

34:01.604 --> 34:02.823
: Kirby,
what are you doing here?

34:02.866 --> 34:03.998
I live here.

34:04.042 --> 34:06.522
Question is, what
are you doing here?

34:06.566 --> 34:07.958
Clearly not
looking for me.

34:08.002 --> 34:09.003
Or texting me.

34:09.047 --> 34:10.700
I feel terrible
about that.

34:10.744 --> 34:11.701
Really?

34:11.745 --> 34:12.702
That's why I came.

34:12.746 --> 34:14.095
For an in-person
apology.

34:14.139 --> 34:16.358
Why should I
believe a word you say?

34:16.402 --> 34:19.361
Why would I lie
about being excited to see you?Eh.

34:19.405 --> 34:22.321
That does sound
like it could be true.

34:22.364 --> 34:23.713
So, should
I take you up

34:23.757 --> 34:25.976
to my room
and show you pics of Australia

34:26.020 --> 34:27.891
or just throw you on my bed?

34:27.935 --> 34:32.374
I was thinking
about something a little more...

34:32.418 --> 34:34.289
dangerous.

34:39.033 --> 34:40.382
How do you get this...
Sorry.Shut up!

34:42.819 --> 34:43.820
Oh!

34:52.177 --> 34:53.526
That was insane.

34:53.569 --> 34:55.528
Yeah. I've never
had anyone do the...

34:55.571 --> 34:56.877
I learned that in Montana.

34:56.920 --> 34:58.444
Ah. Bear country.

34:58.487 --> 34:59.706
Mm-hmm.That makes sense.

34:59.749 --> 35:01.490
Yeah.

35:03.318 --> 35:07.148
This has to be the last time
we do this.

35:07.192 --> 35:08.845
It's just-- it's-it's
too complicated

35:08.889 --> 35:10.934
and... messy.

35:10.978 --> 35:13.328
Yeah. I agree.

35:13.372 --> 35:14.808
Except not really.

35:14.851 --> 35:16.723
You should go
first. All right?

35:16.766 --> 35:18.638
I'm not going anywhere

35:18.681 --> 35:20.248
until you tell me
why you're really here.

35:20.292 --> 35:22.381
Well, I know
it wasn't to see me.

35:22.424 --> 35:25.253
Or even to see me naked.

35:29.692 --> 35:32.478
I'm here for the deed
to the vineyard,

35:32.521 --> 35:33.653
and I found it.

35:33.696 --> 35:35.220
Good for you.

35:35.263 --> 35:37.570
But you know if you need
something stolen from the manor,

35:37.613 --> 35:39.049
you can always just ask me.

35:43.010 --> 35:44.968
LIAM:
Fallon.

35:45.012 --> 35:46.492
Welcome to London.

35:46.535 --> 35:47.928
What are you doing here?

35:47.971 --> 35:49.451
Did they already reject
your pitch in record time?

35:49.495 --> 35:51.540
I wish I could say
I was sorry, but...

35:51.584 --> 35:52.846
I didn't go.

35:52.889 --> 35:55.240
See, I had to tell you
the real end of the story.

35:55.283 --> 35:58.068
The P.I. had the Peach Diamond
the whole time.

35:58.112 --> 36:00.375
Okay, you know how
confused I was before?

36:00.419 --> 36:01.724
Well, this isn't helping.

36:01.768 --> 36:03.248
Can I please go in the room now?

36:03.291 --> 36:05.554
Sure.

36:16.783 --> 36:18.611
What?

36:25.226 --> 36:26.488
No.

36:27.707 --> 36:29.752
Can I at least ask
the question first?

36:36.411 --> 36:38.457
Fallon Carrington,

36:38.500 --> 36:40.459
will you marry me?

36:40.502 --> 36:42.374
No. Wait.

36:42.417 --> 36:44.506
Not until you tell me
what the hell is going on here.

36:44.550 --> 36:45.681
Well, I just proposed to you.

36:45.725 --> 36:48.249
There's no pitch.

36:48.293 --> 36:49.816
I made the story
up on the plane.

36:51.861 --> 36:53.820
I saw your ring yesterday,

36:53.863 --> 36:57.432
and I wanted to be the one
to propose to you this time.

36:57.476 --> 37:00.653
Wait, you knew I was about to
propose and you didn't let me?

37:01.958 --> 37:03.569
That's so rude.

37:03.612 --> 37:06.006
See, I knew if you were pissed
off at me, you wouldn't propose,

37:06.049 --> 37:09.488
so I pretended like you
didn't understand the story,

37:09.531 --> 37:13.100
because I know you like to be
the smartest person in the room.

37:13.143 --> 37:14.101
Well, I don't like it.

37:14.144 --> 37:15.450
It's more of a curse, really.

37:15.494 --> 37:17.191
And it worked.

37:17.235 --> 37:18.584
♪ I'll run away with you

37:18.627 --> 37:20.281
You're surprised.

37:20.325 --> 37:22.109
♪ I'll run away with you

37:25.417 --> 37:26.896
So, what do you say?

37:26.940 --> 37:28.855
"Let's run away together, baby.

37:28.898 --> 37:30.422
Me and you."

37:34.208 --> 37:36.079
"Till the end of time."♪ You

37:36.123 --> 37:37.385
♪ Soft and only

37:37.429 --> 37:39.387

37:47.482 --> 37:51.312
I'm worried about my friend Sam.
He's falling in love with you,

37:51.356 --> 37:52.922
and he thinks
the feeling is mutual.

37:52.966 --> 37:53.923
He's right.

37:53.967 --> 37:55.447
I'm crazy about him.

37:55.490 --> 37:57.057
Never met anybody
like Sam.

37:57.100 --> 38:00.408
He's so fun but
also amazingly deep

38:00.452 --> 38:02.236
and gentle.

38:02.280 --> 38:03.846
And hot.

38:03.890 --> 38:05.283
Oh.

38:05.326 --> 38:07.546
So if you came here to get
me to dump him, no way.

38:07.589 --> 38:09.939
I didn't come here
to get you to break up with him.

38:09.983 --> 38:11.506
I came here to get you
to be honest with him

38:11.550 --> 38:12.942
about where this is going.

38:12.986 --> 38:16.119
And if you really think
he's that special,

38:16.163 --> 38:18.426
you need to do the right thing,

38:18.470 --> 38:20.950
no matter
how hard it is.

38:24.040 --> 38:25.607
Mm-hmm.

38:25.651 --> 38:28.044
JENNINGS:
I paid you half
when we met in Mexico.

38:28.088 --> 38:29.219
Here's the other half.

38:29.263 --> 38:30.743
Got a picture for me?

38:31.918 --> 38:35.008
This woman killed my ex-lover
and my unborn baby

38:35.051 --> 38:38.620
and tried to put
my husband in jail.

38:38.664 --> 38:41.144
There needs to be a price
for her actions.

38:41.188 --> 38:43.625
I'm pretty sure
this is the ultimate price.

38:49.588 --> 38:51.372
Hey.

38:51.416 --> 38:53.243
Hey.

38:53.287 --> 38:54.636
I just talked to Fletcher.

38:54.680 --> 38:55.855
And?

38:57.596 --> 38:58.771
Oh, no.

38:58.814 --> 39:00.381
He dumped me.

39:00.425 --> 39:01.513
He did not.

39:01.556 --> 39:02.992
I was there.

39:03.036 --> 39:04.994
What did he say?

39:05.038 --> 39:08.258
Some crap about how his
husband can't handle it

39:08.302 --> 39:09.608
and he's jealous

39:09.651 --> 39:11.871
and that I didn't deserve
to be in the middle

39:11.914 --> 39:13.176
of this messy situation,

39:13.220 --> 39:14.961
which shouldmake
me feel better.

39:17.137 --> 39:18.356
But it doesn't.

39:18.399 --> 39:20.532
I'm sorry, Sam.

39:20.575 --> 39:23.578
You deserve so much better
than that.

39:24.623 --> 39:25.885
I know.

39:32.544 --> 39:34.372
Hey.

39:34.415 --> 39:35.938
Where have you been?

39:35.982 --> 39:37.462
Your cell kept going
to voice mail.

39:37.505 --> 39:38.463
Oh.

39:38.506 --> 39:40.290
Um, the battery died.

39:40.334 --> 39:41.770
Sorry about that.

39:41.814 --> 39:43.468
But I'm here now.

39:43.511 --> 39:44.643
Okay...

39:44.686 --> 39:46.296
What are you up to?

39:46.340 --> 39:50.300
I just had to take care of a few
personal things with my family.

39:50.344 --> 39:52.564
But everything's
back on track now.

39:52.607 --> 39:54.740
Can I just say
how proud I am of you

39:54.783 --> 39:57.046
for not murdering Dominique yet?

39:58.439 --> 40:01.790
I am all about self-control.

40:04.097 --> 40:06.752
Mm. This makes me
so happy,

40:06.795 --> 40:08.928
I almost forgot
that I got dumped earlier.

40:08.971 --> 40:10.799
Oh, wait, I got to tell you
the best part of the story.

40:10.843 --> 40:12.932
Oh, you mean the part where
I knew you were gonna propose

40:12.975 --> 40:15.456
and I made sure Fallon got
on that plane to London?

40:15.500 --> 40:16.457
What?

40:16.501 --> 40:18.198
You knew and you
didn't tell me?

40:18.241 --> 40:19.242
Great part.LIAM:
Not the best part.

40:19.286 --> 40:21.114
No. The best part being

40:21.157 --> 40:23.072
when you proposed
and I said yes, right?

40:23.116 --> 40:26.075
I was thinking more about the
part where I totally fooled you.

40:26.119 --> 40:27.294
FALLON:
Right.

40:27.337 --> 40:29.339
But which is the best
part of the story

40:29.383 --> 40:31.341
that you'll be
telling for decades?

40:31.385 --> 40:32.995
You said yes.

40:33.039 --> 40:34.257
I said yes.

40:34.301 --> 40:37.173
Well, love may not
have worked out for me,

40:37.217 --> 40:39.132
but I could not be happier
for you two.

40:39.175 --> 40:41.830
Oh. I'll never
dump you, Sam.

40:41.874 --> 40:43.223
Thanks, bro.

40:45.268 --> 40:49.055
Well, I would love to stay
and soak all of this in,

40:49.098 --> 40:52.058
but I do have a re-engagement
party to plan.

40:52.101 --> 40:54.495
Mwah. Let's talk.Let's go.

40:59.413 --> 41:01.371
♪ Baby, I need your touch

41:01.415 --> 41:03.373
♪ I wanna lose control...

41:11.599 --> 41:12.861
Heidi?

41:13.906 --> 41:15.211
Hello, Liam.

41:15.255 --> 41:16.778
What are
you doing here?

41:16.822 --> 41:18.737
Been a long
time, right?

41:18.780 --> 41:20.129
Since Switzerland.

41:20.173 --> 41:22.480
I think the last time we
spoke was when I told you

41:22.523 --> 41:24.438
I was putting the baby
up for adoption.

41:25.613 --> 41:27.746
Look, is there something
you want?

41:27.789 --> 41:29.399
Something I can help you with?

41:39.235 --> 41:40.672
That's my son, Connor.

41:41.934 --> 41:43.370
Our son, Connor.

41:45.067 --> 41:46.895
It's time he meets his father.
