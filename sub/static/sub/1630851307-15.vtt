WEBVTT

00:05.088 --> 00:06.214
Previously, on
"Below Deck Mediterranean"...

00:07.340 --> 00:08.341
This'll be a shorter charter...

00:08.383 --> 00:10.176
Anthony Evans and Chris Loar.

00:10.218 --> 00:12.178
Anthony is a gospel artist.

00:12.220 --> 00:14.514
They'd love to get off
the boat for a picnic.

00:14.556 --> 00:16.641
Man, I'm so grateful that they
took all this stuff up here.

00:16.683 --> 00:18.643
-My back.
-Like [bleep].

00:18.685 --> 00:22.480
Obviously, Lexi's been let go,
and we have two charters left.

00:26.568 --> 00:28.486
I do not want the client
to feel the impact.

00:28.528 --> 00:30.113
How are you guys gonna
do it with two people?

00:30.155 --> 00:31.406
Isn't that gonna be crazy?

00:33.324 --> 00:36.286
I work better under
physical pressure.

00:36.327 --> 00:37.787
I'm better at my job
when I'm running around

00:37.829 --> 00:39.205
like a headless chicken.

00:39.247 --> 00:41.207
Two-person team,
better than four.

00:41.249 --> 00:42.709
A lot of work for us, though.

00:42.751 --> 00:44.210
The dinner was excellent.

00:44.252 --> 00:46.379
My plate had a lot
of dark fish,

00:46.421 --> 00:48.298
so I don't think you
should ever serve that.

00:48.340 --> 00:52.218
I feel insecure when
I get any criticism.

00:52.260 --> 00:54.346
My last boat,
my captain would be,

00:54.387 --> 00:56.097
like, horrible words
the whole time.

00:57.599 --> 01:00.310
Leaving such a supportive
bubble, I'm concerned.

01:00.352 --> 01:02.395
Trying to get that level
of acceptance from new people.

01:04.230 --> 01:05.565
[gasps]
Dave!

01:05.607 --> 01:08.360
You should have come
to me that he was hurt!

01:08.401 --> 01:10.612
It's gonna be Mzi mornings,
Dave lates.

01:10.653 --> 01:12.405
Lloyd and Mzi
will now just kinda

01:12.447 --> 01:13.531
have to step up their game.

01:16.159 --> 01:18.370
There's a lot of responsibility
in the morning shift.

01:18.411 --> 01:20.080
I completely forgot
about the paddleboards.

01:20.121 --> 01:21.623
Please take
the anchor ball down.

01:21.664 --> 01:23.667
-Oh, sorry.
-For [bleep]'s sake.

01:23.708 --> 01:25.585
-What up?
-David, get out on deck.

01:25.627 --> 01:26.878
I think people are
getting tired.

01:26.920 --> 01:29.381
Six minutes till we
get to the marina.

01:29.422 --> 01:30.548
[bleep]'s sake.

01:30.590 --> 01:32.592
Five feet off the dock.

01:32.634 --> 01:33.760
Come on, Mzi.

01:33.802 --> 01:35.470
Ugh [bleep].

01:35.512 --> 01:37.764
Okay, we can put this one on,
we can put this one on.

01:37.806 --> 01:40.600
We're about to hit some
ground lines, and it's my fault.

01:40.642 --> 01:41.768
[bleep]'s sake.

01:59.577 --> 02:02.247
Getting stern lines across now.

02:02.288 --> 02:03.289
Come on, Mzi.

02:03.331 --> 02:06.501
-Ah.
-Quick.

02:06.543 --> 02:08.211
Ugh [bleep].

02:08.253 --> 02:10.505
Okay, we can put this one on,
we can put this one on.

02:10.547 --> 02:12.215
<i>Bump ahead.</i>

02:12.257 --> 02:14.342
The port dolphin is right
in front of me, I can't.

02:14.384 --> 02:15.635
Guys, we need to hurry.

02:15.677 --> 02:17.804
<i>Kick the stern</i>
<i>to port five feet.</i>

02:17.846 --> 02:20.306
-Mzi, where we at?
-Almost there.

02:20.348 --> 02:21.349
Okay, wait, we have to watch
them throw the rope.

02:23.476 --> 02:25.186
You don't have to throw it
where the line's going,

02:25.228 --> 02:26.563
you throw it the
shortest distance.

02:26.604 --> 02:29.357
-Cool.
-Let's throw, Mzi, come on.

02:29.399 --> 02:31.901
<i>Lloyd, Malia, talk to me...</i>
<i>what's going on on the bow?</i>

02:31.943 --> 02:34.404
Port bowline on, waiting for
my starboard line on.

02:34.446 --> 02:35.655
<i>-Hurry.</i>
-Sorry.

02:35.697 --> 02:37.532
What in God's name
did you do here?

02:37.574 --> 02:39.242
I'm kinda at my wits' end

02:39.284 --> 02:40.785
with how many mistakes
are being made.

02:40.827 --> 02:44.205
Mzi ----ed up that line,
and Lloyd...

02:44.247 --> 02:46.291
dude, you forgot
the anchor ball.

02:46.332 --> 02:48.418
Come on, we're making
----ing rookie mistakes.

02:48.460 --> 02:50.211
Just take up all the tension
by hand

02:50.253 --> 02:51.296
and lock it off on the cleat.

02:53.423 --> 02:55.592
Lloyd, which one are you
taking up tension first?

02:55.633 --> 02:57.302
Starboard, as we're
quite far over.

02:57.344 --> 02:58.511
<i>Copy, that works for us.</i>

02:58.553 --> 03:01.348
Drop-off day.
How did we do this?

03:08.730 --> 03:10.857
It would have been all right if
Delaney was here from the start.

03:10.899 --> 03:12.400
Yeah, that is true.

03:12.442 --> 03:13.568
Because then, like, she
would have been trained.

03:13.610 --> 03:15.528
Yeah.

03:15.570 --> 03:16.571
How's your laund looking?

03:16.613 --> 03:18.406
Looking good.

03:18.448 --> 03:19.699
Have you checked with Captain
Sandy, are her sheets done?

03:19.741 --> 03:20.825
-Yeah.
-Thanks, Coco.

03:20.867 --> 03:22.285
You're welcome.

03:25.538 --> 03:27.791
-Get ready.
-Okay.

03:31.795 --> 03:35.507
On the starboard line,
we are now at tension.

03:35.548 --> 03:36.633
Copy, understood.

03:36.675 --> 03:37.717
<i>Nice work.</i>

03:37.759 --> 03:38.885
[sighs]

03:39.886 --> 03:41.846
I still have to do the closet.

03:44.391 --> 03:45.767
-Oh, yeah, yeah.
-Yeah.

03:45.809 --> 03:46.810
Should be a lot more chill
than last dinner.

03:46.851 --> 03:48.395
Won't be any rumble?

03:48.436 --> 03:50.021
No, there won't be
any rumbles tonight.

03:50.063 --> 03:54.359
-No ultimatums?
-No ultimatums ever again.

03:54.401 --> 03:55.777
I'm always worried
I'm gonna get reprimanded.

04:03.785 --> 04:08.289
No, so, I've actually been
thinking about this for a while.

04:08.331 --> 04:09.708
I do wanna give you these.

04:09.749 --> 04:12.502
Yes! Stop!

04:12.544 --> 04:14.587
I don't want you to think
I'm just doing this now

04:14.629 --> 04:16.715
-because it's only me and you.
-Yeah.

04:16.756 --> 04:18.425
Like, I honestly think
you deserve this.

04:18.466 --> 04:20.343
Like, I never have
to ask you for anything.

04:20.385 --> 04:21.553
You're always just on it.

04:21.594 --> 04:23.513
You have worked your
----ing ass off,

04:23.555 --> 04:27.267
and without you,
I would be ----ed.

04:27.308 --> 04:28.560
Officially ----ed.

04:28.601 --> 04:30.478
-So...
-Yay!

04:31.688 --> 04:32.647
Oh.

04:32.689 --> 04:35.650
Thank you so much.

04:35.692 --> 04:37.610
Holy sh--.

04:37.652 --> 04:41.823
Dude, like, I see myself
like a junior stewardess.

04:41.865 --> 04:43.783
Oh, my God, stop it.

04:43.825 --> 04:46.327
It's nice to hear that
she actually notices,

04:46.369 --> 04:47.829
like, how hard I've been,
like, trying and stuff.

04:48.997 --> 04:50.749
Stop it.

04:50.790 --> 04:53.376
I've honestly learned so much,
and I'm so happy.

04:53.418 --> 04:54.461
Oh!

04:56.504 --> 04:59.049
Look!
I have a new stripe!

04:59.090 --> 05:00.925
What! Damn, girl!

05:00.967 --> 05:03.428
Congratulations, I salute you.

05:03.470 --> 05:05.430
You got way more stripes
than I'll ever have.

05:07.098 --> 05:08.933
I can take the carry-ons,
if you like.

05:08.975 --> 05:10.477
Yeah, thanks, Katie.

05:10.518 --> 05:12.395
Deck crew, we've got
luggage ready

05:12.437 --> 05:14.356
in the main deck lobby
whenever you guys are ready.

05:14.397 --> 05:15.982
Copy.

05:16.024 --> 05:17.567
It's been a busy morning.

05:17.609 --> 05:19.986
Oh, it's been a morning.

05:20.028 --> 05:21.404
You can take your mask off.

05:21.446 --> 05:22.739
It's been a rough
morning for Mzi.

05:22.781 --> 05:24.866
I think he's terrified
of me right now.

05:24.908 --> 05:28.661
Started off great,
I was all smiles and happy.

05:28.703 --> 05:30.372
It's just frustrating.

05:30.413 --> 05:32.665
Once you [bleep] one thing up
and your day starts off

05:32.707 --> 05:34.668
like that, it's just a bit
of a ripple effect.

05:34.709 --> 05:38.129
I know that I can do better,
and I should be doing better.

05:38.171 --> 05:40.924
How do I look, do I need to
go touch up or anything?

05:40.965 --> 05:42.092
You look beautiful, Malia.

05:42.133 --> 05:43.760
Oh, thank you, Mzi.

05:43.802 --> 05:45.470
Sure.

05:45.512 --> 05:47.931
Oh, suddenly I forgot
you dropped a heaving line.

05:49.557 --> 05:50.850
Katie, I'm gonna
leave this one for you.

05:50.892 --> 05:52.519
No!

05:52.560 --> 05:53.520
Yeah, yeah, I'm gonna
leave this one for you.

05:53.561 --> 05:54.938
-Actually?
-Yeah, yeah.

05:54.979 --> 05:56.523
Did you want me to
place your hat somewhere?

05:56.564 --> 05:57.941
-Sure, yeah.
-Promise I won't steal it.

05:57.982 --> 06:00.110
-Yeah, you can wear it.
-I really like it.

06:00.151 --> 06:01.528
Man, now I feel bad.

06:01.569 --> 06:02.529
I don't know if
I can accept this.

06:02.570 --> 06:03.530
No, yeah, I want you to have it.

06:03.571 --> 06:05.031
Thank you so much, Ben.

06:05.073 --> 06:06.991
It's a really nice gesture,
but it feels wrong

06:07.033 --> 06:09.536
because he was flirting, and
I don't wanna, like, egg it on.

06:09.577 --> 06:10.578
We're gonna fight over it now.

06:10.620 --> 06:12.539
Yeah, we are.

06:12.580 --> 06:14.416
It's a vibey hat,
I'm here for it.

06:16.501 --> 06:17.836
-Hey, Mzi?
-Yeah?

06:17.877 --> 06:19.504
Have you seen
my stripes recently?

06:19.546 --> 06:21.381
Where'd you get those?

06:21.423 --> 06:23.091
-Oh, second stew!
-She got promoted.

06:23.133 --> 06:25.427
Mine are still very green.

06:25.468 --> 06:26.594
Super happy for her.

06:26.636 --> 06:27.971
Where'd you get those?

06:32.142 --> 06:34.602
-Yay!
-Oh!

06:35.937 --> 06:37.564
Yeah, Courtney!

06:38.982 --> 06:40.525
Ready to go.

06:40.567 --> 06:42.444
All crew, all crew,
guest departure.

06:42.485 --> 06:43.903
On the dock in five minutes.

06:50.035 --> 06:51.161
<i>Mathew?</i>

06:51.202 --> 06:53.580
Mathew, Mathew,
come to the dock.

06:53.621 --> 06:55.498
<i>-On my way.</i>
-Thank you, Katie.

06:57.208 --> 06:58.626
Sorry, guys.

06:58.668 --> 07:00.045
Fancy seeing you here.

07:00.086 --> 07:02.589
I didn't realize
everybody was out already.

07:04.799 --> 07:06.593
Thanks, bro.

07:06.634 --> 07:07.927
Appreciate you.
Thanks.

07:07.969 --> 07:08.928
-Lovely to meet you, Ben.
-Yeah, likewise.

07:08.970 --> 07:10.680
Amazing!

07:10.722 --> 07:11.931
-Really special.
-Nicely done.

07:11.973 --> 07:13.933
Thank you very much,
appreciate it.

07:13.975 --> 07:15.143
Did you find it upstairs,
the hat?

07:15.185 --> 07:16.644
I haven't been up.

07:17.979 --> 07:20.774
My biggest thing with...
with all of you...

07:20.815 --> 07:22.984
well, Mat, your food's nuts.

07:23.026 --> 07:25.070
All of you, everything
that you guys offered,

07:25.111 --> 07:27.530
you did with a smile,
and it felt real genuine.

07:27.572 --> 07:28.948
We really
appreciate y'all's attitudes,

07:28.990 --> 07:30.700
so thank you very much.

07:30.742 --> 07:32.994
And we got a little
something for you.

07:33.036 --> 07:34.788
-Oh, thank you very much.
-Thank you guys.

07:34.829 --> 07:36.581
-Thank you so much.
-Thank you, nice to meet you.

07:36.623 --> 07:37.582
-Bye, we'll see you soon.
-See you soon.

07:37.624 --> 07:39.000
Nice work.

07:39.042 --> 07:40.960
Let's get out of our whites,
into our reds,

07:41.002 --> 07:42.462
and meet in the main salon
for our tip meeting.

07:42.504 --> 07:43.797
-Yeah.
-Woo!

07:45.173 --> 07:46.174
Yeah.

07:48.968 --> 07:50.220
One more.

07:50.261 --> 07:52.889
How do people get changed
so ----ing fast?

07:52.931 --> 07:54.015
-I don't know.
-Like...

07:54.057 --> 07:55.558
It's a talent.

07:57.852 --> 07:59.145
Thank you.

07:59.187 --> 08:01.606
Charter number six.

08:01.648 --> 08:04.651
Katie, I allowed you
the space not

08:04.693 --> 08:06.861
to bring on another stewardess.

08:06.903 --> 08:10.532
You showed me that
you could do this, so...

08:10.573 --> 08:13.827
-Thank you.
-Well done.

08:13.868 --> 08:16.663
I see the interior
is busting their asses.

08:16.705 --> 08:18.498
Like, they're working so hard.

08:18.540 --> 08:21.668
But last charter, I don't think
the work would have gotten done

08:21.710 --> 08:24.504
without the help of deck crew,
because it's just so much.

08:24.546 --> 08:27.882
Everyone's taking on
responsibility and clearly,

08:27.924 --> 08:31.136
deck crew is exhausted
and making stupid mistakes.

08:33.638 --> 08:35.932
Courtney, you're such
a positive energy,

08:35.974 --> 08:38.101
and you work really hard,
and I see that.

08:38.143 --> 08:39.769
Thanks.

08:39.811 --> 08:42.230
And Mathew, not one
client has ever complained,

08:42.272 --> 08:44.774
and I'm just, like, blown away.

08:44.816 --> 08:47.944
Deck crew, you guys...
you gotta work it out.

08:47.986 --> 08:51.156
You were challenged
with logistics,

08:51.197 --> 08:54.284
and you can be more focused.

08:54.325 --> 08:58.163
But you took it to the next
level for the beach picnic.

08:58.204 --> 09:00.206
-Thank you.
-Okay.

09:00.248 --> 09:04.336
So, $15,000...
$1,362 per person.

09:04.377 --> 09:06.046
Very grateful.

09:06.087 --> 09:08.590
So tonight, you know the wine
that we carry on board?

09:08.631 --> 09:10.050
You get to go to that winery.

09:10.091 --> 09:11.134
-Woo-hoo!
-Stop it!

09:11.176 --> 09:12.761
-Yes!
-Best day ever!

09:12.802 --> 09:14.262
Cheers, well done.

09:16.389 --> 09:18.308
Back on the train.

09:22.062 --> 09:23.980
Mzi, what's happening
to your hose?

09:24.022 --> 09:25.815
It was just spinning
out of control.

09:25.857 --> 09:28.234
They're having
a runaway water hose.

09:28.276 --> 09:30.570
So horny!

09:30.612 --> 09:31.946
Is that your runaway water hose?

09:33.782 --> 09:35.784
Come on, be professional.

09:35.825 --> 09:39.329
<i>Operation Water Hose, kinda</i>
<i>like Operation Line Handling.</i>

09:39.371 --> 09:42.582
The mistakes the guys are making
are kind of piggy-backing off

09:42.624 --> 09:44.376
of Captain Sandy's
disciplining me,

09:44.417 --> 09:46.753
so I'm a little
more on guard.

09:46.795 --> 09:49.714
I'm always trying to be
the best that I can be,

09:49.756 --> 09:52.175
and I always want
to impress Captain Sandy.

09:52.217 --> 09:54.260
I don't want her to think
that I'm a sh-- bosun.

09:54.302 --> 09:56.179
<i>Deck crew, let's meet</i>
<i>on the bow, please.</i>

09:58.348 --> 10:01.142
All right, guys, let's
have a quick deck meeting.

10:01.184 --> 10:02.644
I'm sure some of you noticed

10:02.686 --> 10:04.187
the tension on
deck this morning.

10:05.939 --> 10:06.898
-No?
-Yeah.

10:06.940 --> 10:08.274
Yes?

10:08.316 --> 10:10.110
Do we know why that is?

10:11.695 --> 10:13.613
Feedback...
this is an actual question.

10:13.655 --> 10:16.324
Do you guys understand why I
might have tension this morning?

10:20.453 --> 10:22.706
Coming up...

10:22.747 --> 10:24.624
Everyone's going through a
----ing rough time, and, like,

10:34.926 --> 10:36.386
I'm sure some of you noticed the
tension on deck this morning.

10:37.804 --> 10:41.141
Do we know why that is?

10:41.182 --> 10:43.143
Feedback...
this is an actual question.

10:43.184 --> 10:44.853
Do you guys understand
why I might be...

10:44.894 --> 10:46.271
have tension this morning?

10:49.357 --> 10:50.442
Okay.

10:52.360 --> 10:53.737
And the anchor ball.

10:53.778 --> 10:55.155
Please take
the anchor ball down.

10:55.196 --> 10:56.865
-Oh, sorry.
-For [bleep]'s sake.

10:56.906 --> 10:59.075
What do all these things
have in common?

11:00.243 --> 11:01.911
Exactly.

11:01.953 --> 11:03.329
We have crushed it,
everyone's been learning,

11:03.371 --> 11:05.999
and it really, really
gets under my skin

11:06.041 --> 11:08.084
when we start making
rookie, rookie mistakes.

11:08.126 --> 11:09.919
I mean, Mzi, you're green,

11:09.961 --> 11:11.463
but there's a point where
you have to give yourself

11:11.504 --> 11:13.173
a hard time about it
and say look,

11:13.214 --> 11:15.008
I shouldn't be making
these mistakes anymore.

11:15.050 --> 11:16.384
And that's how you
stop being green.

11:16.426 --> 11:18.053
-Yeah.
-It's charter six.

11:18.094 --> 11:20.764
You should always know
what to do next.

11:20.805 --> 11:22.432
Dave, I know you
weren't up for it.

11:22.474 --> 11:25.268
I walked in at the perfect time
to see you chatting to Mathew.

11:25.310 --> 11:28.188
But you see me hustling,
I expect to see you hustling.

11:28.229 --> 11:30.065
You have four minutes.

11:30.106 --> 11:32.359
-How's it going?
-Yeah, it's gonna be a new...

11:32.400 --> 11:34.736
David, get out
on deck, please, now.

11:34.778 --> 11:36.279
Heaving lines, set up.

11:36.321 --> 11:38.406
You're usually the guy
I can count on

11:38.448 --> 11:40.367
to set a good example
for everyone.

11:40.408 --> 11:42.160
You're either meeting
that benchmark, or you're not.

11:42.202 --> 11:44.245
Mm.

11:44.287 --> 11:48.041
I will work through anything
so as not to let my team down.

11:48.083 --> 11:51.753
But I was asked to take
a step back because of my leg.

11:51.795 --> 11:52.879
I did.

11:56.299 --> 11:58.301
When you step off this boat
and you start looking

11:58.343 --> 12:00.011
for your next job,

12:00.053 --> 12:02.305
you can expect someone
to not be as nice about it.

12:03.306 --> 12:05.100
You can expect that.

12:05.141 --> 12:08.853
So, what I want is for our next
charter to absolutely nail it,

12:08.895 --> 12:11.439
because I know you're better,
and I wanna look it, okay?

12:11.481 --> 12:13.983
On that note,
let's get some trash off.

12:14.025 --> 12:15.485
Good chat.

12:24.077 --> 12:25.829
You okay?

12:25.870 --> 12:27.372
I'll be back next charter.

12:28.915 --> 12:30.417
What are you gonna
drink tonight?

12:32.293 --> 12:33.503
Yeah, but what piss
are you gonna suck?

12:33.545 --> 12:35.547
-Probably pink.
-No!

12:35.588 --> 12:38.091
Why am I... why do...
why am I not allowed rosé?

12:38.133 --> 12:40.010
It's when we see
Mr. Extra Nasty.

12:40.051 --> 12:41.177
No, no, no, I'm gonna be...

12:41.219 --> 12:42.387
like, no matter
how much I drink,

12:42.429 --> 12:43.471
I'll be a good boy tonight.

12:43.513 --> 12:45.098
I don't have anyone to sass.

12:45.140 --> 12:47.225
Talk to me, bro.
What's up?

12:47.267 --> 12:48.560
What happened this morning?

12:48.601 --> 12:50.145
I didn't put
the paddleboards out.

12:50.186 --> 12:51.563
Oh, right.

12:51.604 --> 12:53.523
Sandy just asked why
they weren't there,

12:53.565 --> 12:55.442
and then for the heaving lines,

12:55.483 --> 12:56.526
I think Malia was getting
a bit tense.

12:56.568 --> 12:58.236
Mm-hmm.

12:58.278 --> 12:59.904
Everything's just
so fast-paced this morning.

12:59.946 --> 13:01.239
There's so much pressure.

13:01.281 --> 13:02.365
From then, I'm just
in my own head.

13:02.407 --> 13:03.825
Hey, don't worry about it.

13:03.867 --> 13:04.993
For me personally,
it just sucks that

13:05.035 --> 13:06.828
I'm a disappointing to Malia.

13:06.870 --> 13:09.080
I will own it and grow from it
and try better the next time.

13:09.122 --> 13:11.124
It's just one of those mornings.

13:14.377 --> 13:16.546
<i>Katie, Malia, Mathew,</i>
<i>meet me in the crew mess</i>

13:16.588 --> 13:19.049
<i>for charter number seven's</i>
<i>preference sheet meeting.</i>

13:21.051 --> 13:22.469
The last one.

13:22.510 --> 13:24.512
I am so excited knowing
this is the final charter.

13:24.554 --> 13:25.972
Like, the last one.

13:26.014 --> 13:27.599
You can do anything
for four days.

13:27.640 --> 13:29.225
It's like, I just wanna get
the [bleep] off this boat.

13:29.267 --> 13:31.353
All right, charter number seven,
last charter.

13:31.394 --> 13:32.395
-Woo!
-Wow.

13:32.437 --> 13:34.230
Ian Wallace and Jemele Hill.

13:34.272 --> 13:37.359
Ian is a successful
Detroit-born businessman.

13:37.400 --> 13:38.568
Look at that.

13:40.695 --> 13:43.448
And his wife, Jemele,
a journalist, are in Croatia

13:43.490 --> 13:45.450
to celebrate their one-year
wedding anniversary.

13:45.492 --> 13:47.243
Cute.

13:47.285 --> 13:49.245
To help celebrate, they have
brought along their friends

13:49.287 --> 13:51.414
Michael, a sportscaster,
and his wife, Crystal.

13:51.456 --> 13:52.665
Is he on ESPN, Michael Eaves?

13:52.707 --> 13:54.376
Mm-hmm.

13:54.417 --> 13:56.586
Terrence, an entrance attorney,
and his wife, Deborah,

13:56.628 --> 13:59.005
an actress, and Ian's friends

13:59.047 --> 14:02.217
from high school Ronnie,
and his wife, Janeiro.

14:02.258 --> 14:04.886
They're all very
high-profile clients.

14:04.928 --> 14:07.430
On night one, Ian and Jemele
would like to celebrate

14:07.472 --> 14:09.516
their first wedding anniversary.

14:15.438 --> 14:17.148
I do not have
any hidden talents.

14:17.190 --> 14:20.360
I was a dancer growing up,
so, like, my talent is doing

14:20.402 --> 14:23.238
stewy things on big,
white, floaty things.

14:23.279 --> 14:25.240
All of the guests would
like a picnic off the boat.

14:25.281 --> 14:27.409
Wow, that won't be
a problem, right?

14:27.450 --> 14:29.327
Mm.

14:29.369 --> 14:30.954
-Right?
-Right.

14:30.995 --> 14:32.997
Not even one plate
has been sent back.

14:33.039 --> 14:34.207
Have you ever?

14:34.249 --> 14:35.709
Never... never seen
that in my life.

14:35.750 --> 14:37.502
I'm very excited that I've had
a perfect record

14:37.544 --> 14:40.088
so far this season, as far
as no guest complaints,

14:40.130 --> 14:42.590
except for Sandy's fish,
unfortunately.

14:42.632 --> 14:45.969
Constructive criticism...
my plate had a lot of dark fish.

14:46.011 --> 14:47.554
Sorry about that.

14:47.595 --> 14:49.556
No, but they...
it was delicious, thank you.

14:49.597 --> 14:51.474
This is how neurotic I am.

14:51.516 --> 14:53.268
She didn't even complain, all
she did was give me feedback,

14:53.309 --> 14:54.602
and it's still in my head.

14:54.644 --> 14:56.146
I think they're gonna be nice,

14:56.187 --> 14:57.439
but they're gonna
have high standards.

14:57.480 --> 14:58.940
Mm.

14:58.982 --> 15:00.442
We're gonna kill it,
I just know it.

15:00.483 --> 15:01.484
-Thank you.
-Copy that.

15:16.166 --> 15:17.208
Dave, you all right?

15:17.250 --> 15:18.501
How so?

15:18.543 --> 15:21.296
You just seem different,
or upset, or sad.

15:21.338 --> 15:23.131
No, I'm good.

15:23.173 --> 15:24.424
There's nothing wrong,
I'm just a bit more in meself.

15:24.466 --> 15:26.051
Yeah.

15:26.092 --> 15:28.219
I don't mean to come
across anything else.

15:28.261 --> 15:31.514
I think it's just end-of-season
stuff, innit, or nearly there.

15:42.692 --> 15:44.027
Oh, my God, can I come?

15:44.069 --> 15:45.278
-Can you bring it down?
-Bring it down.

15:47.155 --> 15:48.573
Yeah.

15:51.701 --> 15:53.787
Stuck in my throat.

15:53.828 --> 15:57.248
Are we... are we just
gonna let all this go?

15:58.833 --> 15:59.793
What?

15:59.834 --> 16:01.336
He's left me a quote.

16:01.378 --> 16:03.129
-Oh, God, stop.
-Oh, God.

16:03.171 --> 16:05.048
I'm gonna vomit in my mouth.

16:05.090 --> 16:07.133
That hat's so fresh, though.

16:07.175 --> 16:10.428
"How quickly jealous I become
of the wind when it, not I,

16:10.470 --> 16:12.722
gets the privilege of properly
messing up your hair."

16:14.099 --> 16:16.184
-Damn, Ben!
-Woo!

16:16.226 --> 16:17.477
Did someone just sext
me in poetry?

16:17.519 --> 16:19.312
Yep.

16:19.354 --> 16:23.566
Did you just tell me in a poetic
way that you wanna [bleep] me?

16:23.608 --> 16:25.485
-Nice.
-Noice.

16:25.527 --> 16:26.736
Katie from Colorado.

16:26.778 --> 16:28.279
Thanks, Ben.

16:32.409 --> 16:33.660
The hat is cool.

16:33.702 --> 16:35.078
Yeah, the hat's cool.

16:35.120 --> 16:36.454
Well worth whatever
you had to do.

16:39.457 --> 16:40.417
Coming up...

16:40.458 --> 16:42.085
[retches]

16:42.127 --> 16:43.586
He said he's feeling
really tight-chested.

16:43.628 --> 16:45.130
I'm sending Lloyd to shore

16:57.350 --> 16:58.101
Ooh, that's about the phrasing.

16:59.477 --> 17:00.520
Dude, you keep
taking Tinder breaks,

17:00.562 --> 17:02.605
we're gonna be here all day.

17:02.647 --> 17:04.149
-Are you actually on Tinder?
-No!

17:05.567 --> 17:07.277
Malia, can you get
in the shower, please?

17:07.318 --> 17:08.695
-Yeah.
-Because I really need a shower.

17:08.737 --> 17:10.363
I'll be longer,
I'm trying to be nice.

17:10.405 --> 17:12.365
Let's go, I only have...
we have 45 minutes.

17:12.407 --> 17:14.409
We've only got 45 minutes to go!

17:14.451 --> 17:18.288
[babbling]

17:18.329 --> 17:21.332
* Forty-five minutes,
hey, hey, hey *

17:21.374 --> 17:23.168
Oh, you just whipped
my testes with your hair.

17:28.465 --> 17:31.217
This is the 4XL.

17:31.259 --> 17:33.762
Look at the size... look...

17:33.803 --> 17:36.681
Wait, it's actually wider
than it is long.

17:36.723 --> 17:38.683
Second-to-last night out
with this crew,

17:38.725 --> 17:40.894
so it's sad thinking
about it coming to an end.

17:40.935 --> 17:42.354
You've just gotta
take advantage of it,

17:42.395 --> 17:43.897
the time you've
actually still got.

17:43.938 --> 17:45.190
[humming]

17:51.363 --> 17:52.614
We're ready.

17:52.655 --> 17:53.948
All right, let's go!

17:53.990 --> 17:55.617
Can we have some champers?

17:55.658 --> 17:57.202
-Bye, bitch!
-Bye, bitch.

17:57.243 --> 17:58.703
Who's got a drink?
Who's got a drink?

17:58.745 --> 18:00.663
-----ing A.
-Lads, lads, lads.

18:00.705 --> 18:01.915
Ooh-ey-oh!

18:06.544 --> 18:08.838
I really wish
we had someone fit.

18:08.880 --> 18:10.507
Like, I'm not saying
the boys aren't fit.

18:10.548 --> 18:12.258
They're, like, fit and cute
in their own way.

18:12.300 --> 18:13.802
But, like, they're too much
like bros now, you know?

18:13.843 --> 18:15.512
That's the... that's...

18:15.553 --> 18:18.306
Even Mzi, like, you know,
like, me kissed sometimes

18:18.348 --> 18:20.850
but, like, still, there's
no sexual chemistry there.

18:20.892 --> 18:22.519
-No.
-I've got the dad bod.

18:22.560 --> 18:23.770
-For a child.
-You have a built bod.

18:23.812 --> 18:25.563
No, no, I've got a dad bod.

18:25.605 --> 18:26.731
Dad bod means belly.

18:28.400 --> 18:29.984
I have, too!

18:30.026 --> 18:33.279
Meanwhile, and in the
guys' car, dude, nice shirt.

18:33.321 --> 18:34.989
Yo, dude, you look cool.

18:36.658 --> 18:37.701
I'm bald.

18:38.868 --> 18:40.954
Can I come in for a spoon?

18:40.995 --> 18:42.247
Not today.

18:43.540 --> 18:44.582
No.

18:46.418 --> 18:47.377
-What?
-No!

18:47.419 --> 18:49.295
-Dave!
-No!

18:54.718 --> 18:55.677
This is so pretty.

18:55.719 --> 18:56.761
I'm a vineyard boy.

18:58.430 --> 18:59.389
Whew.

18:59.431 --> 19:00.390
Wow.

19:00.432 --> 19:01.474
Holy mother of...

19:01.516 --> 19:03.393
I definitely love wine...

19:03.435 --> 19:05.812
Red wine, white
wine, I don't care.

19:05.854 --> 19:07.313
I would...
I do drink it every day.

19:08.440 --> 19:10.275
Yeah, naughty.

19:11.484 --> 19:13.028
Katie has the
naughtiest model face.

19:13.069 --> 19:15.780
[chattering]

19:15.822 --> 19:17.657
Yes, this is what
I need in my life.

19:17.699 --> 19:19.034
We are going to get dirty, okay?

19:19.075 --> 19:20.535
Yes, I'm all about it.

19:20.577 --> 19:21.870
He said it!

19:21.911 --> 19:22.912
He's speaking
my love language!

19:22.954 --> 19:24.748
Oh!
They're so big!

19:24.789 --> 19:25.623
That's rank.

19:27.959 --> 19:29.502
They've all looked
better than that.

19:31.588 --> 19:33.298
I cannot believe we're at
our last charter already.

19:33.340 --> 19:34.591
I know!

19:34.632 --> 19:35.633
After that first trip,
I was, like...

19:35.675 --> 19:37.427
What have I signed up for?

19:37.469 --> 19:39.929
How many days do I have left?
I think I had a countdown.

19:41.806 --> 19:42.974
Yeah.

19:45.810 --> 19:47.771
That would be perfect.
Cheers to that.

19:47.812 --> 19:50.440
I think it's really cool for
us to get away from the boat,

19:50.482 --> 19:52.901
get away from this environment,
and just enjoy each other.

19:52.942 --> 19:55.779
We're just a weird little
messed-up family, and I like it,

19:55.820 --> 19:57.947
so why not spend
a few more days together?

19:57.989 --> 19:59.449
-I love that.
-Yeah.

19:59.491 --> 20:00.867
-To the goose.
-The motley crew.

20:00.909 --> 20:02.702
To the OGs.

20:02.744 --> 20:04.496
-Are we going inside now?
-We're going to the cellar.

20:04.537 --> 20:05.705
Where is it, is it
in this door?

20:05.747 --> 20:06.998
Ooh, nice.

20:08.833 --> 20:10.960
-Oh, my God!
-Oh, my God, stop.

20:11.002 --> 20:13.338
This is so pretty.

20:13.380 --> 20:14.798
We've got the queens
in the middle.

20:14.839 --> 20:16.758
Yeah, the queens always
sit in the middle

20:16.800 --> 20:18.927
and then people sit around us.

20:18.968 --> 20:22.514
-Two days left.
-Yeah.

20:22.555 --> 20:23.556
I spilled.

20:23.598 --> 20:25.517
-Oh, my God.
-Hell, no.

20:28.895 --> 20:31.690
Yes, Mzi, one last [bleep] up.

20:31.731 --> 20:33.858
Hopefully the last, but
you understand my side.

20:33.900 --> 20:35.610
Like, I have to be hard
on you sometimes.

20:35.652 --> 20:36.945
I can't always be your friend.

20:36.986 --> 20:39.030
I am not gonna fault you
in the slightest.

20:39.072 --> 20:41.574
It's been an amazing experience.

20:41.616 --> 20:42.992
If I didn't actually
have faith in you,

20:43.034 --> 20:44.911
I never would have put you
on morning shift.

20:44.953 --> 20:46.746
But the beauty of it is

20:46.788 --> 20:48.081
the next time you're gonna do it

20:48.123 --> 20:49.624
you'll remember me
screaming at you.

20:49.666 --> 20:51.501
Mzi definitely still
has a lot to learn.

20:51.543 --> 20:52.961
I mean, he's doing a great job,

20:53.003 --> 20:55.505
but I wanna push
him just a little bit more.

20:55.547 --> 20:57.507
I wanna train the guys
to the point

20:57.549 --> 20:59.551
that I know that
they're confident on deck.

20:59.592 --> 21:01.886
They're not gonna get coddling
from their next bosun.

21:01.928 --> 21:03.430
You're gonna be fine.

21:03.471 --> 21:04.848
-Cheers to us!
-Yeah!

21:04.889 --> 21:07.517
No, no, wait!

21:07.559 --> 21:08.893
-Very motley crew.
-Wait, I have a speech.

21:08.935 --> 21:10.520
Oh sh--.

21:10.562 --> 21:12.397
I just wanna say a special
thank you to Katie,

21:12.439 --> 21:14.524
because you're the best boss
bitch I've ever met.

21:14.566 --> 21:15.859
Yeah.

21:15.900 --> 21:18.069
This charter has been hard,
but me and Katie

21:18.111 --> 21:19.904
obviously appreciate, like, all
the help that everyone's given.

21:19.946 --> 21:21.698
Yeah.

21:21.740 --> 21:23.575
I literally am so happy, and I,
like, love you all so much.

21:23.616 --> 21:25.118
-Aw!
-We love you.

21:25.160 --> 21:26.494
And Dave-O, the laundry...

21:26.536 --> 21:29.706
Dave-O.
[bleep] Dave's amazing.

21:29.748 --> 21:31.875
I love you all, like,
good vibes all over.

21:31.916 --> 21:34.627
Like, you're all just
amazing vibes, and I love it.

21:34.669 --> 21:36.713
Courtney, I'd say you're
weirdly our foundation.

21:36.755 --> 21:37.756
Oh!

21:37.797 --> 21:39.049
-Yeah, you are.
-You are.

21:39.090 --> 21:40.717
See, I literally will be,
like, in a mood,

21:40.759 --> 21:42.594
-and then she will come up.
-Yeah.

21:42.635 --> 21:43.928
And then within about,
like, 30 seconds...

21:43.970 --> 21:45.555
Yeah, you're the sunshine
of my day.

21:45.597 --> 21:46.598
...to a minute, we are,
like, giggling, laughing.

21:46.639 --> 21:47.891
Yeah.

21:47.932 --> 21:49.851
I'm like, what are you
doing to me?

21:49.893 --> 21:51.061
Even when I can tell you're
exhausted, you're upset...

21:51.102 --> 21:52.395
-Yeah.
-you still, like...

21:52.437 --> 21:53.980
You're, like, hey, it's Coco.

21:54.022 --> 21:55.732
You do something funny,
and you lighten the mood.

21:55.774 --> 21:56.900
Thank you so much.

21:56.941 --> 21:58.943
-Here's to Coco!
-Here's to Coco!

21:58.985 --> 22:01.863
Thank you so much, guys,
I love you all.

22:04.866 --> 22:05.992
Rosé's my favorite.

22:06.034 --> 22:07.744
And since then,
like, I decided...

22:07.786 --> 22:08.912
Shut the [bleep] up.

22:08.953 --> 22:10.914
I need to apologize.
Are you joking?

22:10.955 --> 22:12.415
Shut up.

22:12.457 --> 22:14.000
Oh!

22:15.460 --> 22:17.754
Yeah, Courtney!

22:17.796 --> 22:19.172
Thank you!

22:22.050 --> 22:26.054
I feel so bad that, like, I was
joking so much about it.

22:32.018 --> 22:33.770
We both think the world
of each other,

22:33.812 --> 22:35.605
and acknowledging
this whole situation,

22:35.647 --> 22:37.691
I hope that it helps us get
back to where we were,

22:37.732 --> 22:39.984
like, on a friendship level and
stuff, because he's great.

22:40.026 --> 22:41.152
I love you so much.

22:41.194 --> 22:42.612
Is it really only 7:21?

22:42.654 --> 22:45.156
-Yeah, I know.
-I get so wasted.

22:45.198 --> 22:46.574
This is so nice,
this place, though.

22:46.616 --> 22:48.952
This is my favorite night out.

22:48.993 --> 22:52.622
I think because Lexi wasn't
here, and I'm so anti-Lexi.

22:54.958 --> 22:56.167
Stop!

22:57.168 --> 22:58.628
I hate that word.

22:58.670 --> 22:59.754
-Oh, I hate you.
-You're a bad human.

22:59.796 --> 23:01.256
But I hate you.

23:01.297 --> 23:03.758
She was out of line, you were
saying some sh-- things.

23:03.800 --> 23:04.926
You were saying, like,
"I hate you," or whatever.

23:04.968 --> 23:06.177
-I did.
-But you didn't, like...

23:06.219 --> 23:07.220
But she would take it
to the next...

23:07.262 --> 23:08.722
She took it to the next level.

23:08.763 --> 23:10.640
Like, the very first time
in the hot tub,

23:10.682 --> 23:12.726
her and I ----ing
hated each other.

23:17.814 --> 23:19.524
You're ----ing a
----ing deckhand.

23:19.566 --> 23:21.484
You ----ing deckhand!

23:21.526 --> 23:24.487
You're a ----ing bosun,
stand the [bleep] down.

23:24.529 --> 23:26.906
But here's the thing,
is what I realized is that

23:26.948 --> 23:28.867
her and I grew up very similar.

23:28.908 --> 23:30.160
Like, I know what
it's like to grow up

23:30.201 --> 23:32.162
in a very strict
religious household

23:32.203 --> 23:35.707
and try to combat against that,
and I think a lot of, like...

23:37.208 --> 23:38.293
She had bad parents.

23:38.335 --> 23:39.794
No, my parents are amazing.

23:39.836 --> 23:41.671
Your parents should
have aborted you.

23:41.713 --> 23:43.840
No, but at the same time,
she's trying to still be

23:43.882 --> 23:46.051
loved by her mom,
which is a very ----ed-up

23:46.092 --> 23:47.802
situation to be in.

23:47.844 --> 23:50.055
And I've also been in
that situation, you know?

23:50.096 --> 23:51.681
And not that that's an excuse,

23:51.723 --> 23:53.725
but I think that,
you know, when she...

23:53.767 --> 23:55.185
She's also going through
a sh-- time...

23:55.226 --> 23:56.561
-she's just lost her dad.
-Exactly.

23:59.147 --> 24:00.732
You didn't miss anything.

24:00.774 --> 24:01.900
Why are we talking
about her, she's gone.

24:01.941 --> 24:03.860
I know she ----ed up massively,

24:03.902 --> 24:05.236
but I don't think at heart
that she's a terrible person.

24:05.278 --> 24:07.030
-No, I don't either.
-Disagree.

24:07.072 --> 24:08.948
She did some really sh--ty...
yeah, okay, you disagree.

24:08.990 --> 24:10.533
She's gone.

24:10.575 --> 24:12.118
Like, Mathew,
you've got your wish,

24:12.160 --> 24:14.204
and you're ----ing lucky
to be here also.

24:14.245 --> 24:16.956
So, I feel like you, out
of any crewmember right now,

24:16.998 --> 24:19.876
does not have the authority
to speak bad about her,

24:19.918 --> 24:22.212
because you have
been just as bad.

24:22.253 --> 24:23.880
Zip your little pie hole, mate,

24:23.922 --> 24:26.174
drink your ----ing wine,
and eat your dinner.

24:26.216 --> 24:28.051
Because she did some things,

24:28.093 --> 24:31.805
everyone had a reason to feel
the way they did towards her.

24:31.846 --> 24:33.098
-She's a horrible person.
-See, I've... no, no, no.

24:33.139 --> 24:34.599
-No, she...
-Okay, mate...

24:34.641 --> 24:35.725
-No, no, no.
-You can't say that.

24:35.767 --> 24:37.102
-No, no, no, so you--
-I can.

24:37.143 --> 24:39.104
She's a human being, and
she ----ed up massively.

24:39.145 --> 24:40.105
-Everybody is human.
-That is what happened.

24:40.146 --> 24:41.898
Everyone is human, and...

24:41.940 --> 24:43.692
I'm still angry about her
standing in my dirt pile.

24:43.733 --> 24:47.904
Unfortunately, it affected
all of us, and I said Lexi,

24:47.946 --> 24:50.156
you've gone against everything
I morally stand for.

24:50.198 --> 24:51.866
I wanna give you
another chance.

24:51.908 --> 24:53.743
Yeah, but Mathew's right,
everyone is going...

24:53.785 --> 24:55.286
She's...

24:55.328 --> 24:56.913
Everyone's going through a
----ing rough time, and,

24:56.955 --> 25:00.000
like, nobody has to take
it out on other people.

25:03.294 --> 25:04.337
Coming up...

25:05.922 --> 25:08.341
You can say what you wanna say.

25:18.518 --> 25:19.728
I think she's going
through a really rough time.

25:21.104 --> 25:22.647
Tough time, yeah.

25:22.689 --> 25:24.149
Do I think she's
a terrible person?

25:24.190 --> 25:25.150
-No.
-No.

25:25.191 --> 25:26.693
Yeah, but everyone is going...

25:26.735 --> 25:28.319
Coco's going through
a tough time.

25:32.032 --> 25:33.408
Exactly.

25:37.412 --> 25:39.205
Are you okay?
What's wrong?

25:50.717 --> 25:52.927
I know that everyone deals
with things differently,

25:52.969 --> 25:55.680
but no matter
what you're dealing with,

25:55.722 --> 25:58.892
you don't have to be
a [bleep] to people to, like,

25:58.933 --> 26:01.061
deal with something, okay?

26:01.102 --> 26:04.856
Everyone's going through their
own sh-- always, and yeah,

26:21.331 --> 26:23.166
You are a gem.

26:23.208 --> 26:25.502
Like, I never even knew that
you were going through things,

26:25.543 --> 26:28.838
and you're such
a legend, you are.

26:30.215 --> 26:32.384
But some people
don't have that.

26:32.425 --> 26:34.219
I know how much it affects you,

26:34.260 --> 26:36.012
and you deal with
it in such grace.

26:36.054 --> 26:38.973
But Malia, stop calling
Lexi a nice person.

26:39.015 --> 26:40.350
She's not a horrible person,
she's going, like...

26:40.392 --> 26:41.810
No, she's the worst.

26:41.851 --> 26:43.937
I'm sick of all
this Lexi-defending.

26:43.978 --> 26:46.064
Yeah, I... I...
I completely agree.

26:46.106 --> 26:47.941
I would also like to say that
the yachting industry should

26:47.982 --> 26:51.277
take the firing statements of,
like, every other profession.

26:51.319 --> 26:54.239
Just because it's yachting
doesn't mean that it should be,

26:54.280 --> 26:56.282
-oh, like, we'll allow it, bra.
-Yeah, yeah.

26:56.324 --> 26:57.909
If you did that in the UK,

26:57.951 --> 26:59.911
you'd be getting a prosecution
against you.

26:59.953 --> 27:01.913
Yeah, but Lloyd, in a normal
world, you don't live and work

27:01.955 --> 27:03.164
and go out and
do everything together.

27:03.206 --> 27:04.833
No.

27:04.874 --> 27:06.501
In a normal world, you go
to work from 8:00 a.m.

27:06.543 --> 27:08.795
to 5:00 p.m.
and then go home.

27:08.837 --> 27:10.255
It will always be different.

27:10.296 --> 27:12.841
I took a lot of time and
effort to change my career,

27:12.882 --> 27:15.260
and then I certainly
didn't expect to come into

27:15.301 --> 27:17.512
this industry and be faced
with issues like this.

27:17.554 --> 27:20.265
My previous experiences and
the experience on this boat

27:20.306 --> 27:24.102
with Mat and Lexi has made me
wary of what's the next job,

27:24.144 --> 27:27.105
and is it gonna be such a safe
and understanding environment.

27:27.147 --> 27:28.481
Yeah.

27:28.523 --> 27:30.859
-I'm going for a wee.
-I'm coming.

27:32.318 --> 27:33.945
I'm still mad from when
she stepped

27:33.987 --> 27:35.530
in my pile of dirt
and wouldn't move.

27:45.331 --> 27:47.125
Worst-case scenario
is Lexi being

27:47.167 --> 27:48.918
in a very bad place after this.

27:48.960 --> 27:51.004
I've been there, I've
been in dark places,

27:51.046 --> 27:52.547
felt sh-- about myself.

27:52.589 --> 27:55.884
And they prescribed me meds,
and in my head,

27:55.925 --> 27:58.970
I'd convince myself that if I
just took everything I've got,

27:59.012 --> 28:01.181
I'd go to sleep
for a few weeks.

28:01.222 --> 28:03.099
All I remember was waking up
in a hospital bed

28:03.141 --> 28:05.977
the next day, just, like...

28:06.019 --> 28:07.312
I was empty.

28:07.354 --> 28:09.189
And I was so ----ing scared, eh.

28:10.899 --> 28:13.318
Obviously that's
a very dark ----ing turn.

28:13.360 --> 28:15.236
I'm just trying to say even
though she wasn't

28:15.278 --> 28:19.240
a nice person to me,
she is still a human being.

28:19.282 --> 28:20.992
Dave's all religious
about Lexi now.

28:21.034 --> 28:23.328
I'm not at all.
Just ----ing stop.

28:23.370 --> 28:25.538
-Just oi, Mat.
-I'm sorry.

28:25.580 --> 28:27.248
Mat, seriously, listen.

28:27.290 --> 28:29.918
-I'm sorry, I'll...
-Just ----ing stop.

28:29.959 --> 28:32.253
-Okay.
-No, I'm not happy.

28:32.295 --> 28:35.173
-Today, it... it was sh--.
-Why?

28:37.550 --> 28:39.386
That's all I got,
I ain't got nothin' more.

28:43.056 --> 28:44.516
-Okay, guys, we're going.
-Let's go, let's go home.

28:44.557 --> 28:46.226
Let's leave before
the vibe drops.

28:46.267 --> 28:47.560
Oh, dear.

28:49.979 --> 28:51.523
I love you so much, and
I know you're going

28:51.564 --> 28:53.316
through a tough time, and
I'm always there for you.

28:53.358 --> 28:54.401
-Thank you.
-Tell me.

28:54.442 --> 28:55.944
It's too close to the end.

28:55.985 --> 28:58.238
Thank you so much.
Hvala.

28:58.279 --> 29:00.198
David, you can say
what you wanna say,

29:00.240 --> 29:01.616
especially if it's me.

29:03.201 --> 29:04.411
Come on, girls, I'm with you.

29:04.452 --> 29:05.870
Got it.

29:05.912 --> 29:07.372
Why'd Dave get upset
all of a sudden?

29:07.414 --> 29:09.582
Dave can't describe
why his vibe dropped

29:09.624 --> 29:11.668
without upsetting the unity.

29:11.710 --> 29:12.877
-With me.
-With me.

29:12.919 --> 29:14.045
-Who is it with?
-With me.

29:14.087 --> 29:15.505
It's with me.

29:15.547 --> 29:17.048
Speak your mind, baby boy.

29:17.090 --> 29:18.508
I ain't got nothing
to say, honestly.

29:18.550 --> 29:20.010
-Oh, my God, Dave, shut up.
-Well, you do.

29:22.345 --> 29:24.055
It's just I...

29:24.097 --> 29:25.640
I'm tired, everyone's
----ing tired.

29:25.682 --> 29:28.393
For me, its just difficult
to come from

29:28.435 --> 29:30.395
nearly four and a half
years on boats...

29:30.437 --> 29:32.105
Yeah.

29:32.147 --> 29:34.274
Like this morning, I felt like
I was being told off

29:34.315 --> 29:36.443
for something that
was a bit ridiculous.

29:36.484 --> 29:38.236
And there's nothing against it.

29:38.278 --> 29:41.156
Like, it's petty sh--
okay, it's petty sh--.

29:41.197 --> 29:44.909
I'm harder on you
because you work

29:44.951 --> 29:45.994
at the same pace that I work.

29:46.036 --> 29:47.954
You work at a bosun's pace.

29:47.996 --> 29:51.166
You saw me today,
that was at Lloyd and Mzi.

29:51.207 --> 29:54.044
But I don't hold them to the
same pedestal that I hold you.

29:54.085 --> 29:56.046
I think as a leader it's like
the same thing,

29:56.087 --> 29:57.672
-how I feel about Court.
-Yeah.

29:57.714 --> 30:01.259
You get the less direction,
and you are expected the most.

30:01.301 --> 30:02.677
Right.

30:02.719 --> 30:04.012
It only stung when you said
to me, like, it...

30:04.054 --> 30:05.263
am I the problem.

30:05.305 --> 30:07.015
It gets to a point
where I feel like

30:07.057 --> 30:10.101
I'm being condescended,
underappreciated.

30:10.143 --> 30:13.605
And what I wanna say to you is
I completely understand you.

30:13.646 --> 30:17.984
I appreciate you,
completely get it.

30:18.026 --> 30:20.362
You know that you're lucky
to be here, right?

30:20.403 --> 30:24.324
Your food's good, but, like, you
did act a little bit of a knob.

30:24.366 --> 30:26.242
Yeah, but I...

30:26.284 --> 30:27.660
I'm lucky to be here,
but at the same time,

30:27.702 --> 30:29.454
I don't give a [bleep].

30:29.496 --> 30:33.291
Like, how much...
whoa, whoa.

30:33.333 --> 30:36.378
I'm holding a bottle of
tequila and two beers.

30:38.630 --> 30:41.132
We're back!

30:41.174 --> 30:43.093
I just want some
big old sweatpants.

30:43.134 --> 30:44.135
Me, too.

30:44.177 --> 30:46.471
Why is it so cold around here?

30:47.597 --> 30:49.683
Who wants a gin and tonic?

30:49.724 --> 30:50.684
Come on, bitch.

30:50.725 --> 30:52.310
Let's do this shot.

30:52.352 --> 30:55.105
Girls, bitches.

30:55.146 --> 30:56.690
Hey!

31:01.194 --> 31:03.071
I just "magungaed" in my pants.

31:03.113 --> 31:04.114
I'm gonna regret this.

31:04.155 --> 31:05.115
-Okay.
-Bitches!

31:05.156 --> 31:06.157
[bleep]

31:06.199 --> 31:09.327
[shouting]

31:13.415 --> 31:16.334
Shake it!

31:16.376 --> 31:21.381
Yo... somebody's farted up in
this joint, and it ain't me.

31:21.423 --> 31:23.008
That's me, I'm sorry.

31:23.049 --> 31:25.552
Somebody's farted,
and it's Malia.

31:25.593 --> 31:28.763
I'm gonna come out for a ciggy
'cause it stinks so much.

31:28.805 --> 31:30.557
Sorry to break up
the party, everyone!

31:32.225 --> 31:33.643
We're not in uniform.

31:33.685 --> 31:35.437
Woo-hoo!

31:35.478 --> 31:37.105
I'm so horny.

31:37.147 --> 31:39.357
-Oh!
-Oh!

31:40.567 --> 31:43.403
Oh, my... no!

31:47.073 --> 31:48.491
This is not okay!

31:48.533 --> 31:49.743
I'm not happy.

31:52.203 --> 31:53.246
I can't!

31:54.539 --> 31:55.749
Coming up...

31:55.790 --> 31:57.834
Lloyd!

31:57.876 --> 31:58.710
Slow down.

32:06.968 --> 32:07.385
I'm so horny!

32:09.637 --> 32:13.266
-Oh!
-Oh, my... no!

32:13.308 --> 32:14.559
No!

32:22.650 --> 32:24.527
This is not okay!

32:27.530 --> 32:29.324
That laugh...

32:31.493 --> 32:34.371
My chest hurts from laughing.

32:34.412 --> 32:38.875
And now I am the drunkest
human being on this planet.

32:38.917 --> 32:40.168
He's back.

32:44.881 --> 32:46.508
Yeah, I'm going to bed.

32:51.596 --> 32:53.098
[snoring]

32:56.935 --> 32:58.728
Stop!

32:59.813 --> 33:01.314
Ah!

33:08.947 --> 33:10.407
Thank you so much.

33:14.953 --> 33:16.538
Yeah, you want some champagne?

33:16.579 --> 33:18.498
You all right?

33:18.540 --> 33:20.625
[mumbling]

33:20.667 --> 33:22.168
Oh, my God.

33:22.210 --> 33:23.962
Today it's gonna be windy.

33:24.004 --> 33:28.174
I'm guessing we're going early,
because there's 26 knots.

33:28.216 --> 33:30.260
I think this is not
the charter I wanted to end on.

33:30.301 --> 33:31.261
Well, that's gonna be
a sh-- show.

33:31.302 --> 33:32.554
These people seem nice,

33:32.595 --> 33:34.180
but they're gonna be
a lot, you know?

33:34.222 --> 33:36.474
-With two people.
-I'm scared this trip.

33:36.516 --> 33:38.893
I mean, we can always
obviously help out wherever...

33:38.935 --> 33:41.396
No, I know, you guys...
it's not on you guys, you know?

33:41.438 --> 33:44.649
Last charter, the guests
were not very demanding.

33:44.691 --> 33:47.193
If all my time in yachting
has taught me anything,

33:47.235 --> 33:48.653
it's that it won't happen again.

33:48.695 --> 33:50.280
Good times.

33:50.321 --> 33:52.365
I think it's gonna be
a hectic last trip.

33:52.407 --> 33:53.825
Yeah, me too.

33:55.910 --> 33:58.580
Oh ----ing ugh!

33:58.621 --> 33:59.748
Of course.

34:02.584 --> 34:03.877
Hello, Lloyd-O.

34:03.918 --> 34:05.462
Hey.

34:07.422 --> 34:10.383
Yeah, I just can't find my
radio, and, well, it's just...

34:10.425 --> 34:12.260
Is that it?

34:12.302 --> 34:14.721
I think it's that one there,
that's because... ugh.

34:14.763 --> 34:16.890
What's wrong?

34:16.931 --> 34:17.891
Don't be stressed.

34:17.932 --> 34:19.309
It's all right.

34:19.351 --> 34:20.560
I'll be all right
in a minute.

34:20.602 --> 34:22.395
I've got a lot going
on in my head...

34:22.437 --> 34:24.606
am I gonna find a new crew,
what's the next job,

34:24.647 --> 34:26.649
and is it gonna be not
a place that I wanna be?

34:26.691 --> 34:28.443
A little bit overwhelming.

34:34.991 --> 34:37.702
-Radar's a good one to have.
-Oh.

34:37.744 --> 34:39.454
Do you think you'll
stick with the deck side,

34:39.496 --> 34:40.663
or do you wanna do engineering?

34:42.624 --> 34:45.543
If I'm honest with you, I just
want a job, like, after this.

34:45.585 --> 34:47.045
Yes.

34:50.465 --> 34:52.801
<i>Hey Malia, come meet me</i>
<i>on the bridge now.</i>

34:52.842 --> 34:54.469
<i>Copy, I'm on my way.</i>

34:54.511 --> 34:56.429
Ow!

34:56.471 --> 34:58.932
-Morning.
-Good morning.

34:58.973 --> 35:01.267
Unfortunately, the wind's
gonna come in earlier, so

35:01.309 --> 35:02.519
-we're gonna take off earlier.
-I saw that.

35:02.560 --> 35:03.937
Okay.

35:03.978 --> 35:05.355
And we're just gonna anchor
off Sibenik

35:05.397 --> 35:06.940
and then receive
the guests over there,

35:06.981 --> 35:10.610
and head to our wind-secure
anchorage that we go to.

35:10.652 --> 35:11.945
Okay.

35:11.986 --> 35:13.321
All right, sounds good.

35:15.740 --> 35:17.075
All right.

35:17.117 --> 35:18.743
My stomach's so sore,
I don't get it.

35:18.785 --> 35:20.453
I just feel sick,
and I don't know why.

35:20.495 --> 35:21.496
I think it's, like, nerves.

35:24.874 --> 35:27.419
A little bit of anxiety,
or a little bit of nerves,

35:27.460 --> 35:30.088
but I genuinely feel like
I've made the right decision.

35:30.130 --> 35:32.507
Like, that's what my gut's
telling me, that's why I did it.

35:32.549 --> 35:34.884
I really don't have
any regrets towards it.

35:34.926 --> 35:36.636
I think I did what
needed to be done

35:36.678 --> 35:37.971
and what was best
for the boat.

35:38.013 --> 35:39.639
-Very anxious.
-Yeah.

35:39.681 --> 35:41.516
I don't like it.

35:41.558 --> 35:44.436
Okay, for this last one, as
we're coming off the dock today

35:44.477 --> 35:46.521
we've got a lot of wind.

35:46.563 --> 35:48.440
Lloyd, I'd like you on the bow,

35:48.481 --> 35:49.691
because I just feel like you're
the most comfortable up there.

35:49.733 --> 35:50.942
Yeah.

35:50.984 --> 35:52.027
Are you gonna be
okay with that today?

35:52.068 --> 35:53.611
-Yeah.
-Okay.

35:53.653 --> 35:55.405
And then we'll be
on the stern, okay?

35:55.447 --> 35:57.323
-Last charter!
-Yeah.

35:57.365 --> 35:58.491
Sweet, guys, thank you.

36:00.452 --> 36:03.371
All crew, all crew, that
is provisions just arriving.

36:06.166 --> 36:07.834
Guys, let's go,
let's go, let's go.

36:07.876 --> 36:10.712
Last provisions!
Woo!

36:10.754 --> 36:12.047
This can go on the floor
in the walk-in.

36:17.927 --> 36:20.055
Last one ever.
Feels so good, right?

36:21.639 --> 36:23.683
We need to focus on just
getting off the dock.

36:23.725 --> 36:25.769
Let's just...
I'm gonna take the box.

36:25.810 --> 36:27.854
Just take the flowers down.

36:27.896 --> 36:29.939
Malia, you can start
freeing up when you're ready.

36:29.981 --> 36:31.149
Copy.

36:31.191 --> 36:33.526
Go, go, go, go, go, go.

36:33.568 --> 36:34.569
Okay, I'm taking these
down and then gonna

36:34.611 --> 36:36.071
go back down to the laund.

36:36.112 --> 36:39.532
Captain Sandy, that is starboard
stern lines on board.

36:39.574 --> 36:42.369
Go ahead with the
port line on the bow.

36:42.410 --> 36:43.745
Understood.

36:48.917 --> 36:51.878
Starboard line on and
clear, releasing port now.

36:51.920 --> 36:53.963
Go, go, go, just drop it, yeah.

36:54.005 --> 36:55.965
That is all stern
lines on board.

36:56.007 --> 36:57.592
How's the bow looking?

37:00.762 --> 37:04.140
Looks like he's pulling it now,
Captain Sandy.

37:04.182 --> 37:06.059
Are all lines in?

37:06.101 --> 37:08.895
<i>Bow, bow, are</i>
<i>all bow lines in?</i>

37:10.438 --> 37:12.107
Lloyd, is it clear
to maneuver?

37:20.949 --> 37:23.660
<i>That's all lines in, and</i>
<i>port dolphin is pulled.</i>

37:25.161 --> 37:26.204
Whew.

37:28.623 --> 37:29.874
Everything will be fine.

37:29.916 --> 37:31.543
Courtney, Katie.

37:31.584 --> 37:33.420
Can you jump up and
do Captain Sandy's cabin

37:33.461 --> 37:34.421
straightaway, please?

37:34.462 --> 37:35.588
She's out of it now.

37:35.630 --> 37:37.465
Copy that, on my way.

37:37.507 --> 37:39.592
Yo, I was
thinking cheesecake for lunch,

37:39.634 --> 37:42.470
but then I see the primary...
is he, like, anti-cheese?

37:42.512 --> 37:43.888
I'm stressed.

37:43.930 --> 37:45.724
-She has...
-Come on, let's go.

37:45.765 --> 37:47.100
She has cheesecake, though.
I'm just gonna go with it.

37:47.142 --> 37:48.476
Should I try to make
cookies too, or no?

37:48.518 --> 37:50.478
-Oh, my God.
-What?

37:52.063 --> 37:53.940
Three nights.
Three nights.

37:55.984 --> 37:57.986
<i>All right, let's do this...</i>
<i>fenders in.</i>

38:11.124 --> 38:12.500
Copy that, four in the water.

38:19.632 --> 38:21.092
Do you copy, drop the anchor?

38:21.134 --> 38:22.761
Copy, dropping now.

38:28.058 --> 38:29.100
Lloyd.

38:31.061 --> 38:32.103
Slow down...

38:38.777 --> 38:40.153
That is white at the waterline.

38:40.195 --> 38:43.156
<i>Thank you, we're good.</i>

38:43.198 --> 38:45.283
Copy.

38:45.325 --> 38:46.951
Something is off with Lloyd.

38:46.993 --> 38:49.662
Some, like, really rookie
mistakes were made.

38:49.704 --> 38:52.123
They're mistakes that he
usually wouldn't ever make.

38:52.165 --> 38:54.250
That line is not all
the way on deck.

38:54.292 --> 38:55.960
Yeah.

38:56.002 --> 38:58.672
If that line were to slip
and run, we'd be ----ed.

38:58.713 --> 39:00.173
-Yeah.
-All right?

39:00.215 --> 39:01.925
I really need you to step it up.

39:01.966 --> 39:03.551
Yeah.

39:05.303 --> 39:06.596
I really need you to pick
up your game, okay?

39:06.638 --> 39:08.515
Yeah.

39:08.556 --> 39:09.808
I don't know what's going on,
but I need the Lloyd back.

39:13.144 --> 39:14.938
We can make it
a slightly long line

39:14.979 --> 39:16.064
because we've gotta fit
that blue one in.

39:16.106 --> 39:17.148
Yeah.

39:17.190 --> 39:18.525
Do you wanna jump into laundry

39:18.566 --> 39:19.567
and just smash out all
the linen?

39:19.609 --> 39:20.652
Yeah.

39:22.237 --> 39:23.321
Beautiful.

39:26.991 --> 39:31.663
Oh, my God, Daddy, I'm so pumped
for this last charter, okay?

39:36.626 --> 39:38.044
Guests are arriving here,

39:38.086 --> 39:41.297
so we can stage towels,
chairs, and a shoe basket.

39:43.842 --> 39:45.301
Malia, do you wanna
put the swim ladder in?

39:45.343 --> 39:47.846
No, but good question.

39:47.887 --> 39:50.640
Okay, will you two do a
top-to-bottom, please?

39:50.682 --> 39:53.184
-This looks great.
-Yeah.

39:55.770 --> 39:58.273
[gagging]

40:01.943 --> 40:03.653
Lloyd?

40:14.247 --> 40:15.373
Okay, will you two do
a top-to-bottom, please?

40:16.916 --> 40:18.001
-This looks great.
-Yeah.

40:21.129 --> 40:24.215
[gagging]

40:33.016 --> 40:34.684
[retches]

40:37.354 --> 40:39.022
Lloyd.

40:41.941 --> 40:43.151
Did you just get sick?
What's going on?

40:48.365 --> 40:50.033
Go get off the deck.

40:50.075 --> 40:51.409
Go chill out for a bit, okay?

40:51.451 --> 40:53.119
All right.

40:53.161 --> 40:54.371
You need to just let me know
if it worsens, okay?

40:54.412 --> 40:56.373
-Yeah, yeah, all right.
-All right.

40:56.414 --> 40:58.041
Ugh.

41:00.752 --> 41:02.212
Ugh.

41:23.525 --> 41:25.985
-How come I feel so dead?
-Don't know, me too.

41:28.154 --> 41:29.114
Yeah.

41:29.155 --> 41:31.199
Captain Sandy?

41:31.241 --> 41:32.867
Sorry, I didn't wanna
call over the radio.

41:32.909 --> 41:35.286
Lloyd's feeling really
tight in the chest.

41:36.996 --> 41:38.957
I just sent him to get
off the deck for a bit.

41:38.998 --> 41:40.375
It started this morning,

41:40.417 --> 41:41.835
and I could just tell
something was up.

41:41.876 --> 41:43.378
He, like, was getting sick

41:43.420 --> 41:45.171
and he just said he was feeing
really tight-chested.

41:45.213 --> 41:47.132
We should take his
blood pressure.

41:51.261 --> 41:53.847
Hi. Drink some water.

41:53.888 --> 41:56.182
Lloyd... where'd he go?

41:56.224 --> 41:58.018
-He's just in his cabin.
-Hey, Lloyd.

41:58.059 --> 42:00.895
I'd like for you to come up
to the bridge.

42:00.937 --> 42:02.313
Do heart problems run
in your family?

42:02.355 --> 42:03.398
No.

42:03.440 --> 42:04.858
Come with me.

42:07.902 --> 42:09.237
Let's take your
blood pressure.

42:09.279 --> 42:12.073
Sit.

42:12.115 --> 42:14.826
I don't know if you know, but I
don't think Lloyd's very well.

42:14.868 --> 42:16.953
Yeah, I do know, thank you.

42:31.509 --> 42:32.969
Is it worse?

42:36.348 --> 42:38.183
I'm gonna have you
lay down after this.

42:44.230 --> 42:45.982
-You're gonna be okay.
-Yeah, I know.

42:46.024 --> 42:47.317
I feel stupid.

42:47.359 --> 42:49.319
Look at me...
you're gonna be fine.

42:49.361 --> 42:50.862
Yeah...

42:50.904 --> 42:52.280
Don't feel stupid.

42:56.451 --> 42:58.203
All right...

43:03.166 --> 43:04.834
You can use my bathroom.

43:08.338 --> 43:09.589
[retches]

43:10.965 --> 43:12.008
He needs to go ashore.

43:12.050 --> 43:13.218
Okay.

43:13.259 --> 43:14.928
Standby.

43:14.969 --> 43:16.471
<i>Malia, Malia, we need</i>
<i>to get Lloyd ashore.</i>

43:16.513 --> 43:18.306
-Copy.
-What happened to Lloyd?

43:18.348 --> 43:20.266
<i>We're gonna do a water taxi.</i>

43:20.308 --> 43:22.018
<i>-Understood.</i>
-Hi, it's Sandy.

43:22.060 --> 43:23.812
I'm sending Lloyd ashore
because his blood pressure

43:23.853 --> 43:25.146
is really high.

43:25.188 --> 43:27.982
He has chest pains, he's
nauseous...

43:28.024 --> 43:29.067
[vomits]

43:29.109 --> 43:31.027
...and I'm concerned.

43:31.069 --> 43:32.028
<i>-Okay.</i>
-Okay.

43:32.070 --> 43:33.071
All right, thank you.

43:33.113 --> 43:34.155
Wait, what happened to Lloyd?

43:36.616 --> 43:38.201
Oh, no, really?

43:38.243 --> 43:40.453
Okay, you're gonna go
to the hospital, right?

43:40.495 --> 43:42.038
Yeah, but you're gonna be fine.

43:42.080 --> 43:43.331
What happened?

43:43.373 --> 43:44.958
Something with
his chest, apparently.

43:45.000 --> 43:47.460
That way.

43:47.502 --> 43:50.130
We're coming to
the swim platform.

43:50.171 --> 43:51.381
He's gonna get in the taxi now.

43:51.423 --> 43:53.341
-All right.
-Wanna go that way?

43:53.383 --> 43:55.218
-Yeah.
-It's easier stairs.

43:58.888 --> 44:00.181
Oh.

44:00.223 --> 44:02.517
<i>Water taxi has arrived</i>
<i>at the aft.</i>

44:02.559 --> 44:04.144
Copy.

44:05.353 --> 44:06.563
-Text me, all right?
-Yeah.

44:06.604 --> 44:08.273
[coughing]
