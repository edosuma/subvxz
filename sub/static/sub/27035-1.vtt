Hey champ, I need to lock up.

02:13.615 --> 02:16.582
What am I supposed to do?

02:16.584 --> 02:18.421
Look after our boys.

02:56.858 --> 02:57.861
You again.

02:59.727 --> 03:02.431
You should pace yourself, man.

03:04.833 --> 03:07.401
You brought them?

03:07.403 --> 03:10.736
Yeah, you know you can get
these prescribed by a doctor?

03:10.738 --> 03:13.307
Hurry up, we're
missing the fight.

03:13.309 --> 03:14.408
How much do I owe you?

03:14.410 --> 03:15.245
50.

03:16.544 --> 03:17.743
It's not easy getting
these things, you know.

03:17.745 --> 03:19.882
Come on.

03:22.885 --> 03:25.986
You got a slot for an old dog?

03:25.988 --> 03:28.889
You sure you
should be fighting?

03:28.891 --> 03:30.623
What do you reckon?

03:30.625 --> 03:32.895
You think it's a good idea?

03:42.804 --> 03:45.340
I think it's a great idea.

03:52.780 --> 03:55.784
Get it, get it,
get it, that's it.

03:58.853 --> 04:00.386
And I'll tell you what,

04:00.388 --> 04:01.622

04:01.624 --> 04:02.855

done for that woman,

04:02.857 --> 04:06.360
but she isn't here,
I lost her too.

04:11.799 --> 04:14.034
Ah!

04:24.747 --> 04:25.578

04:25.580 --> 04:26.813

05:15.863 --> 05:17.798
Christ, that's strong.

05:17.800 --> 05:18.798
Where'd you get that?

05:18.800 --> 05:20.567
The old country.

05:20.569 --> 05:22.034
It's good stuff.

05:22.036 --> 05:23.272
Let's try it.

05:24.072 --> 05:26.707
So, you're gonna be a daddy.

05:26.709 --> 05:28.974

that's gonna be.

05:28.976 --> 05:30.046
Here, try this.

05:32.680 --> 05:33.546
What's that?

05:33.548 --> 05:34.781
What do ya think?

05:34.783 --> 05:36.383
My da brought it in last week.

05:36.385 --> 05:38.484
It's the real shit, man.

05:38.486 --> 05:40.620
I'm all right.

05:40.622 --> 05:42.688
Ah, don't be like that.

05:42.690 --> 05:44.861
Fine, more for me and you.

05:48.029 --> 05:52.866
Go on, make yourself numb.

05:52.868 --> 05:53.702
Hey.

06:01.510 --> 06:06.412
All right, pay attention,
we're taking the next left.

06:06.414 --> 06:08.515
Right,
let's park up here.

06:08.517 --> 06:10.049
Why?

06:10.051 --> 06:12.085
My da, he won't
want to see the girls there.

06:12.087 --> 06:13.019
I know what he's like.

06:13.021 --> 06:14.755
What, a sexist?

06:14.757 --> 06:16.326
Old school.

06:21.729 --> 06:22.828
Wait right here.

06:22.830 --> 06:23.996
Okay, I'll be back in a bit.

06:23.998 --> 06:25.798
Don't have a cigarette
whilst I'm gone

06:25.800 --> 06:29.001
and no drink either, right Mina?

06:29.003 --> 06:30.469
Right.

06:30.471 --> 06:31.573
Away with ya.

06:33.608 --> 06:34.443
Go.

06:46.087 --> 06:48.522
Right, go, your da will be
asleep by the time we get there.

06:48.524 --> 06:50.760
All right, won't be long.

06:52.594 --> 06:55.195
So, where you
going after this?

06:55.197 --> 06:56.630
To see my old man,

06:56.632 --> 06:59.433
tell him he's
gonna be a grandad.

06:59.435 --> 07:01.133
I thought you haven't
seen him in years?

07:01.135 --> 07:03.772
Aye, well, family's family.

07:04.940 --> 07:06.606
You shouldn't turn
your back on it.

07:06.608 --> 07:09.041
When have you seen your Dad?

07:09.043 --> 07:11.111
We're about to.

07:11.113 --> 07:13.145
No, your real dad,
Shaw's just your stepdad.

07:13.147 --> 07:15.851
Like I said, we're about to.

07:17.118 --> 07:18.118
You need to focus.

07:18.120 --> 07:20.085
Don't speak unless spoken to.

07:20.087 --> 07:22.154
If my da asks you anything,

07:22.156 --> 07:23.589
you answer straight away.

07:23.591 --> 07:25.491
Ain't his work card
a reason to get in?

07:25.493 --> 07:26.661
I'm serious.

07:32.967 --> 07:37.072
2nd of May, 1974, guess
who walks into the gym?

07:38.474 --> 07:40.039
Sugar Ray.

07:40.041 --> 07:41.140
What, Leonard?

07:41.142 --> 07:42.909
Sugar Ray Leonard.

07:42.911 --> 07:46.813
Was about two years before
he won the gold in Montreal.

07:46.815 --> 07:49.950
The slickest boxer
on the planet.

07:49.952 --> 07:51.116
He looked like a starving kid.

07:52.187 --> 07:53.753
Jesus Christ.

07:53.755 --> 07:55.154
So he steps in the gym.

07:55.156 --> 07:57.657
Next thing, he's on the banks.

07:57.659 --> 08:00.562
Jumping rope and
lacing up to spar.

08:01.262 --> 08:02.895
Did you get to talk to him?

08:02.897 --> 08:03.729
Ray?

08:03.731 --> 08:04.664
Aye.

08:04.666 --> 08:06.065
I did better than that,

08:06.067 --> 08:08.204
I went five rounds with him.

08:09.070 --> 08:10.106
Shit.

08:11.507 --> 08:13.138
Well come on, how'd you do?

08:13.140 --> 08:14.541
Well I didn't put
him on his arse,

08:14.543 --> 08:16.209
if that's what you're asking.

08:16.211 --> 08:18.210
But he didn't put
me on mine either.

08:18.212 --> 08:19.582
I held my own.

08:21.183 --> 08:23.116
After the five
rounds, he says to me,

08:23.118 --> 08:24.851
do you want to go another round?

08:26.921 --> 08:27.756
Well?

08:28.923 --> 08:30.056
I'm standing there
with a swollen eye

08:30.058 --> 08:31.758
and blood running down my nose.

08:31.760 --> 08:34.659
I said, "Absolutely, let me
go and get my gun first."

08:38.131 --> 08:39.167
Come on.

08:40.535 --> 08:41.938
Fuck off.

08:43.604 --> 08:44.837
Da'.

08:44.839 --> 08:47.307
Nice of you to drop by.

08:47.309 --> 08:50.175
So, what are we
gettin' up to tonight, lads?

08:50.177 --> 08:51.079
A wee mind.

08:52.314 --> 08:53.246
So, you're Danny?

08:53.248 --> 08:54.079
Ya, he's the boxer...

08:54.081 --> 08:56.117
I wasn't asking you.

08:58.954 --> 09:01.621
Your boss says you're
a pretty good fighter

09:01.623 --> 09:03.557
and your da was a champion.

09:03.559 --> 09:05.125
Went by the name
of The Highlander.

09:05.127 --> 09:07.327
Aye, not anymore though.

09:07.329 --> 09:09.194
What, you're not a
good fighter anymore?

09:09.196 --> 09:10.797
No, my dad.

09:10.799 --> 09:12.966
He's works over at the uni.

09:12.968 --> 09:14.199
So, what are you doing here

09:14.201 --> 09:17.270
down in the docks
with a prick green?

09:17.272 --> 09:18.704
Why don't you make
a name for yourself,

09:18.706 --> 09:20.242
go pro, like your da?

09:21.108 --> 09:22.978
It's not my scene.

09:24.179 --> 09:27.016
And stealing
from containers is?

09:28.849 --> 09:32.120
Kids these days, all
bent out of shape.

09:32.988 --> 09:34.120
I didn't go pro either,

09:34.122 --> 09:37.126
I preferred fighting
on the cobbles.

09:38.225 --> 09:41.026
He was a champion
too, ya know.

09:41.028 --> 09:44.029
Aye, of some sort.

09:44.031 --> 09:47.266
Right, let's clean up the mess.

09:47.268 --> 09:50.803
Do you ever get
like cravings and shit?

09:50.805 --> 09:53.606
Aye, ice cream, I
can't eat enough of it.

09:53.608 --> 09:55.375
Well that's hardly a craving.

09:55.377 --> 09:57.776
I mean everyone likes
ice cream, right?

09:57.778 --> 09:58.978
I read this thing on Facebook,

09:58.980 --> 10:00.045
there was this woman

10:00.047 --> 10:02.215
and she had a craving for coal.

10:02.217 --> 10:04.351
It was like pictures of her
eating it and everything,

10:04.353 --> 10:06.555
it was proper fucked up.

10:07.355 --> 10:08.888
Do you want kids?

10:08.890 --> 10:10.960
Uh, no, kids are gross.

10:19.334 --> 10:20.169
Shit.

10:21.703 --> 10:24.303
What the fuck happened here?

10:24.305 --> 10:26.242
Tony here, fucked up.

10:27.376 --> 10:30.076
You didn't give them
enough air, did ya Tony?

10:30.078 --> 10:32.278
Now we're a delivery short.

10:32.280 --> 10:34.114
What am I gonna
tell the Russians now?

10:34.116 --> 10:35.381
You said he could
be fucking trusted.

10:35.383 --> 10:36.816
I was I supposed to know

10:36.818 --> 10:39.251
he wouldn't let
them get some air?

10:39.253 --> 10:41.590
Christ, one's still alive.

10:43.291 --> 10:44.260
So there is.

10:45.292 --> 10:46.661
Bring her out.

10:48.430 --> 10:49.265
Move.

10:53.435 --> 10:55.869
On your knees.

10:55.871 --> 10:57.236
Please.

10:57.238 --> 10:58.771
Take this.

10:58.773 --> 11:00.140
What for?

11:00.142 --> 11:03.145
Don't ask questions,
just take it.

11:07.181 --> 11:10.216
Tommy's bit of
fun on the journey.

11:10.218 --> 11:13.155
Too busy sucking
cock up on deck.

11:14.723 --> 11:16.255
I imagine you
know how to use one?

11:16.257 --> 11:17.156
I don't understand?

11:17.158 --> 11:21.226
It's not rocket
science, shoot her.

11:21.228 --> 11:22.828
Please.

11:22.830 --> 11:24.097
Da.

11:24.099 --> 11:24.898
How many times do
I have to tell you?

11:24.900 --> 11:27.067
Keep your mouth shut.

11:27.069 --> 11:28.738
No, I won't do it.

11:31.940 --> 11:33.405
How can I trust you,

11:33.407 --> 11:34.808
if you don't shoot her?

11:34.810 --> 11:35.774
I'm not gonna shoot
an innocent girl,

11:35.776 --> 11:36.976
for fuck sake.

11:36.978 --> 11:38.877
How do I know you
won't go to the police?

11:38.879 --> 11:40.380
Or her, for that matter?

11:40.382 --> 11:43.415
Christ, just pay her to
keep her mouth shut, please.

11:43.417 --> 11:48.188
If I had a pound the
amount of times I heard that.

11:48.190 --> 11:49.755
Don't do this.

11:49.757 --> 11:51.423
Just get on with
it for fuck sake,

11:51.425 --> 11:53.025
we ain't got all night.

11:53.027 --> 11:54.193
Give it rest, Jule, will ya?

11:54.195 --> 11:56.096
Fuck off Pat, you've been
giving at this all night.

11:56.098 --> 11:57.362
Just shut the fuck up.

12:02.970 --> 12:04.136
You've got a lot to learn boy.

12:04.138 --> 12:05.071
Why the fuck did you do that?

12:05.073 --> 12:06.072
Shit show, why don't you just,

12:06.074 --> 12:07.372

12:07.374 --> 12:08.743

12:10.445 --> 12:11.410
Relax will ya?

12:11.412 --> 12:12.879
No, Pat, this is fucked.

12:12.881 --> 12:14.114
She did nothing wrong.

12:14.116 --> 12:15.148
Danny, come on, chill.

12:15.150 --> 12:16.381
Don't fucking touch me.

12:16.383 --> 12:19.385
I didn't sign up for this.

12:19.387 --> 12:21.321
You're a fucking monster.

12:21.323 --> 12:22.956
Come on.

12:34.335 --> 12:35.236
Fuck you.

12:36.470 --> 12:39.872
Danny, you can't walk away.

12:39.874 --> 12:40.942
Aye, I can.

12:42.209 --> 12:44.146
I want no part in this.

12:45.313 --> 12:48.050
You can all go and
fuck yourselves.

12:52.320 --> 12:54.422
That's a fucking shame.

13:04.431 --> 13:05.233
Fuck!

13:14.309 --> 13:15.144
Go on.

13:49.076 --> 13:49.911
Take it.

13:51.613 --> 13:52.448
Take it.

13:54.114 --> 13:55.049
Finish him.

14:16.103 --> 14:16.939
Shit.

14:17.605 --> 14:18.439
Patrick.

14:21.642 --> 14:23.443
You took your time.

14:23.445 --> 14:25.010
Fuck off, will ya?

14:28.550 --> 14:29.385
Wait!

14:40.594 --> 14:41.430

15:02.283 --> 15:05.086
No, no, no, no,

15:09.291 --> 15:10.124
Help!

15:13.194 --> 15:14.459
Help!

15:25.473 --> 15:26.474
Okay, one.

15:27.541 --> 15:28.377
One, two.

15:33.982 --> 15:36.949
So, you think I'm
ready for a fight?

15:36.951 --> 15:38.483
Not quite yet.

15:38.485 --> 15:39.452
Why not?

15:39.454 --> 15:41.287
I've been training for months.

15:41.289 --> 15:42.288
Billie you'll get

15:42.290 --> 15:43.555
- your chance.
- I'm ready.

15:43.557 --> 15:44.557
Don't worry, you'll
get your chance, okay?

15:44.559 --> 15:45.792
Boxing's based on discipline.

15:45.794 --> 15:47.994
There's no point rushing into
the ring ahead of your time

15:47.996 --> 15:49.696
or you'll end up
punch drunk, okay?

15:49.698 --> 15:50.529
Yeah, all right.

15:50.531 --> 15:51.566
Go on.

15:52.499 --> 15:53.665
You're here tomorrow, right?

15:53.667 --> 15:54.669
Of course.

15:55.737 --> 15:56.572
See ya.

16:02.509 --> 16:06.279
Harvey, what you talking
to those guys about?

16:06.281 --> 16:07.112
What?

16:07.114 --> 16:08.380
Don't play stupid.

16:08.382 --> 16:09.515
Nothing, just a
bit of business.

16:09.517 --> 16:11.985
Business, in the gym?

16:11.987 --> 16:12.617
Yeah.

16:12.619 --> 16:13.653
What business?

16:13.655 --> 16:14.486
Are you in on this?

16:14.488 --> 16:16.655
Listen, relax,
it's no big deal.

16:16.657 --> 16:18.591
This gym is for the kids.

16:18.593 --> 16:20.425
To get them off the street,
not put them back on it.

16:20.427 --> 16:21.626
What's wrong with you?

16:21.628 --> 16:24.399
What do you want
to do, hit me?

16:25.566 --> 16:27.702
Don't fucking touch me.

16:36.243 --> 16:39.578
Yeah, just over there.

16:39.580 --> 16:40.413
Can I help you?

16:40.415 --> 16:42.115
Are
you Robert McCray?

16:42.117 --> 16:43.382
Aye, who's asking?

16:43.384 --> 16:45.684
We have some
news about your brother.

17:06.574 --> 17:08.608
Okay, we'll be
continuing with how

17:08.609 --> 17:13.246
classical authors had huge
cultural and moral influence.

17:13.248 --> 17:15.214
Aand honing in on
the ways in which,

17:15.215 --> 17:16.748
where's that gone now?

17:16.750 --> 17:20.252
In which styles transmitted
from one author to another.

17:20.255 --> 17:23.624
Now, who can tell me
what stylometry means?

17:30.431 --> 17:31.630
My vision still impaired
from last night?

17:31.632 --> 17:33.736
Is half my class missing?

17:35.135 --> 17:36.701
Sammy, can you pay
attention please?

17:36.703 --> 17:38.336
Where is everyone?

17:38.338 --> 17:40.806
We weren't
expecting you.

17:40.808 --> 17:43.609
Amy, would you
care to elaborate?

17:43.611 --> 17:45.611
I just said we
weren't expecting you.

17:45.613 --> 17:48.281
Oh, who were you
expecting, Hemingway?

17:48.283 --> 17:49.849
George Orwell, perhaps?

17:49.851 --> 17:53.785
To be fair sir, you
haven't turned up all week.

17:53.787 --> 17:56.121
I am sorry about that.

17:56.123 --> 17:57.355
I've not been...

17:57.357 --> 17:59.694
William, can I
have a quick word?

18:01.696 --> 18:05.363
Professor Hines will be
taking over your class.

18:05.365 --> 18:09.504
Right
everyone, where were we?

18:10.638 --> 18:12.338
If this is about last week,

18:12.340 --> 18:13.773
I had a lot on my plate.

18:13.775 --> 18:17.209
William, that conversations
is for another day.

18:17.211 --> 18:18.646
Here they come.

18:19.814 --> 18:20.815
Hey William.

18:21.815 --> 18:23.216
Come here.

18:23.218 --> 18:24.649
Charlie, what
are you doing here?

18:24.651 --> 18:27.753
Hello, I'm Detective
Inspector Thomas.

18:27.755 --> 18:30.590
We'd like a moment with
you to talk about your son.

18:30.592 --> 18:31.724
Which one?

18:31.726 --> 18:32.561
Danny.

18:37.699 --> 18:39.834
Can I get a go on that?

18:46.373 --> 18:48.174
So how'd it happen?

18:48.176 --> 18:49.408
They found him at the docks

18:49.410 --> 18:51.710
with severe injuries
to his head and back.

18:51.712 --> 18:52.879
We checked his mobile

18:52.881 --> 18:54.880
and your phone was the last
number called last night,

18:54.882 --> 18:56.181
around nine o'clock.

18:56.183 --> 18:57.582
I didn't answer it.

18:57.584 --> 18:59.651
An answer message perhaps?

18:59.653 --> 19:00.753
Is that all?

19:00.755 --> 19:02.854
William, relax, we need
to ask these questions,

19:02.856 --> 19:04.524
it's protocol, that's all.

19:04.526 --> 19:06.859
You know as well as I do,
I don't talk to my sons.

19:06.861 --> 19:08.326
You have to speak to Robert.

19:08.328 --> 19:09.661
I didn't mean any disrespect.

19:09.663 --> 19:11.831
Like I said, you have
to speak to Robert.

19:11.833 --> 19:13.666
Sorry William, we
don't want to keep you.

19:13.668 --> 19:15.400
But if there is
anything you can give us

19:15.402 --> 19:16.736
that might help with
the investigation,

19:16.738 --> 19:19.639
then don't hesitate to call me.

19:19.641 --> 19:22.874
See, I can't imagine what
you're going through just now.

19:22.876 --> 19:25.646
But work aside,
I'm here for you.

19:28.516 --> 19:29.814
Look, here's my card.

19:29.816 --> 19:31.883
If you can't get
through to your brother,

19:31.885 --> 19:33.321
I'm here to help.

20:01.248 --> 20:03.448
You
have one new message.

20:03.450 --> 20:05.751
First new message.

20:21.536 --> 20:22.371
No!

20:25.239 --> 20:27.175
No, no, no, no, no, no!

20:38.719 --> 20:39.555
No!

20:46.693 --> 20:49.363
1 Timothy 6, reads as follows,

20:50.965 --> 20:52.734
aim at righteousness,

20:53.934 --> 20:55.836
godliness, faith, love,

20:57.639 --> 20:58.806
steadfastness,

21:00.475 --> 21:01.410
gentleness.

21:02.943 --> 21:05.580
Fight the good fight of faith.

21:06.713 --> 21:09.881
As we gather to
remember Danny's life,

21:09.883 --> 21:13.854
we recall that he fought the
good fight as a man of faith.

21:15.555 --> 21:16.391
As a son,

21:17.924 --> 21:19.460
and as a friend.

21:27.934 --> 21:28.833
Three words.

21:33.307 --> 21:34.707
William.

22:02.069 --> 22:04.505
The poet, Robert Frost...

22:21.655 --> 22:23.658
The poet Robert Frost...

22:27.362 --> 22:29.930
The poet Robert
Frost once wrote,

22:30.898 --> 22:33.966
"All I have learned of life

22:33.968 --> 22:36.305
"can be put in three words."

22:39.006 --> 22:39.940
It goes on.

22:58.459 --> 22:59.094
Robert.

23:09.504 --> 23:10.339
William.

23:14.542 --> 23:15.776
Hey, come here.

23:20.614 --> 23:21.947
Great speech.

23:21.949 --> 23:23.983
Thank you.

23:23.985 --> 23:25.987
How're you holding up?

23:30.123 --> 23:31.093
It's a blur.

23:32.093 --> 23:34.062
Aye, I can imagine.

23:34.929 --> 23:36.562
Robbie didn't stay long.

23:36.564 --> 23:39.031
Hmm, we're still not talking.

23:39.033 --> 23:40.632
Hey, look at me.

23:40.634 --> 23:44.803
If you need anything,
you let me know, okay?

23:44.805 --> 23:48.073
They still got some of his
personals down at the station.

23:48.075 --> 23:50.743
Why don't you come by
tomorrow and pick them up?

23:50.745 --> 23:52.143
I can do that.

23:52.145 --> 23:53.946
- Daddy.
- Hey.

23:53.948 --> 23:56.015
Say hello to your uncle.

23:56.017 --> 23:56.852
Come.

23:57.952 --> 24:01.620
You let me know when you're
coming tomorrow, aye?

24:01.622 --> 24:02.791
Come on girls.

24:05.559 --> 24:06.794
The good fight.

24:27.180 --> 24:28.647
What, you're bored?

24:28.649 --> 24:31.820
I'll tell you what,
I'm fucking bored.

24:43.163 --> 24:45.531
♪ Danny Boy

24:45.533 --> 24:49.601
♪ The pipes, the
pipes are calling

24:49.603 --> 24:53.205
♪ From glen to glen

24:53.207 --> 24:56.844
♪ Down the mountain side

25:02.182 --> 25:04.617
Courage, serenity
and wisdom, aye?

25:04.619 --> 25:05.583
Eh?

25:05.585 --> 25:07.055
Fat good you did me!

25:22.670 --> 25:24.937
Stevie Wallace the other day.

25:24.939 --> 25:27.843
Disaster of his
put an end to that.

25:28.942 --> 25:30.876
Anyway, this is it.

25:30.878 --> 25:33.879
I wasn't expecting you so early.

25:33.881 --> 25:35.813
Best to get it over with.

25:35.815 --> 25:38.182
Aye, understandable.

25:38.184 --> 25:40.986
All right, well this is it.

25:40.988 --> 25:42.888
Can you give me a minute?

25:42.890 --> 25:44.823
Aye, of course.

25:44.825 --> 25:47.325
I'll be out in the hallway.

25:47.327 --> 25:50.030
Don't touch anything else, eh?

26:18.992 --> 26:21.025
You get everything?

26:21.027 --> 26:21.927
Aye.

26:21.929 --> 26:23.098
Hello again.

26:24.265 --> 26:27.765
You said my son was associated
with some criminals, who?

26:27.767 --> 26:30.302
We know he's close friends
with a guy named Patrick.

26:30.304 --> 26:32.804
He's a step-son of
an ex-con named Shaw.

26:32.806 --> 26:34.305
Have you brought him in yet?

26:34.307 --> 26:36.140
We can't without
sufficient evidence.

26:36.142 --> 26:39.745
Aye, there's
a photo of Danny and girl.

26:39.747 --> 26:41.313
Jessica was his girlfriend.

26:41.315 --> 26:42.150
Mm hmm.

26:43.718 --> 26:45.887
She's pregnant, William.

26:50.324 --> 26:51.159
Okay.

26:53.227 --> 26:54.159
So what's next?

26:54.161 --> 26:56.061
You gonna speak to this Shaw?

26:56.063 --> 26:58.964
Aye, I'll send down a few
guys, ask some questions.

26:58.966 --> 27:00.198
But in the meantime,

27:00.200 --> 27:02.970
if you see either
of them, stay clear.

27:04.939 --> 27:05.707
Fine.

27:08.909 --> 27:11.075
Your brother seems wired.

27:11.077 --> 27:12.678
Give it a rest, will you?

27:12.680 --> 27:16.183
How would you feel if
you just lost a son?

27:22.789 --> 27:24.625
Hey Jessica, you up?

27:26.293 --> 27:28.263
I've got some food for ya.

27:29.997 --> 27:31.999
I've got some ice cream.

27:34.168 --> 27:34.802
Hey Jess.

27:36.336 --> 27:38.803
If you don't want eat for you,

27:38.805 --> 27:41.806
eat for your baby, come on Jess.

27:51.117 --> 27:55.053
It's not healthy, you
being in here like this.

27:55.055 --> 27:57.359
You need to keep windows open.

28:01.161 --> 28:02.730
Get some fresh air.

28:05.900 --> 28:08.670
I know what happened
is terrible,

28:11.138 --> 28:15.243
but you have to stay
healthy for the baby's sake.

28:16.110 --> 28:17.376
My brother would kill me

28:17.378 --> 28:19.178
if he knew I wasn't
looking out for you.

28:19.180 --> 28:20.849
So give us a chance.

28:22.816 --> 28:23.651
Please.

28:31.825 --> 28:35.226
So, modern authors
are being influenced

28:35.228 --> 28:38.063
by their contemporaries
rather than

28:38.065 --> 28:41.268
writers from the 18th
and 19th centuries.

28:44.371 --> 28:45.403
Surely we can still respond

28:45.405 --> 28:49.276
to great ideas in
Shakespeare or Homer or not.

28:51.444 --> 28:54.079
Christ it's hot in here.

28:54.081 --> 28:55.913
You don't say much, do ya?

28:55.915 --> 28:57.783
I think it's because
contemporary writing is

28:57.785 --> 29:00.052
well, more contemporary.

29:00.054 --> 29:02.387
Stories with subject matter
such as fashion and sex

29:02.389 --> 29:04.989
are more relatable
to our generation.

29:04.991 --> 29:06.358
Okay, very good.

29:08.062 --> 29:10.361
Right, that's all for today.

29:10.363 --> 29:12.132
Have nice weekends.

29:24.344 --> 29:25.412
Mr. McCray?

29:26.413 --> 29:28.880
Amy, you don't need
to call me Mr. McCray,

29:28.882 --> 29:31.949
William's fine, I feel
so bloody old otherwise.

29:31.951 --> 29:33.451
What can I do for you?

29:33.453 --> 29:34.352
I just wanted to let you know

29:34.354 --> 29:35.888
that there's been
rumors around school

29:35.890 --> 29:38.392
about why you haven't been in.

29:39.360 --> 29:41.226
Oh, like what?

29:41.228 --> 29:42.460
I just wanted to say I'm sorry

29:42.462 --> 29:44.295
for what I said in
class the other day.

29:44.297 --> 29:45.464
If that happened to me,

29:45.466 --> 29:48.100
I wouldn't be in either, I
don't think anyone would be.

29:48.102 --> 29:49.467
Okay, you don't need
to worry about that...

29:49.469 --> 29:51.836
And don't worry about us.

29:51.838 --> 29:53.507
Be with your family.

29:59.145 --> 30:00.813
Chin down, heads up, come on.

30:00.815 --> 30:02.848
Nice Billie, stick the jab.

30:02.850 --> 30:04.185
Nice, real nice.

30:05.385 --> 30:08.419
All right enough fella,
come on take it easy on her.

30:08.421 --> 30:11.055
Come on Billie
let's work, come on.

30:11.057 --> 30:11.890
That's nice!

30:11.892 --> 30:13.795
Stick the jab, come on.

30:19.132 --> 30:20.299
Come on Billie let's work!

30:20.301 --> 30:22.203
Come on, let's move it!

30:23.304 --> 30:25.907
Soft, go a bit softer, come on.

30:30.411 --> 30:32.009
Come on, take it easy.

30:32.011 --> 30:33.378
Come on!

30:33.380 --> 30:35.980
That's nice, stick
the jab, come on.

30:35.982 --> 30:38.152
Come on, come on.

30:40.554 --> 30:42.353
Hey Jesus!

30:42.355 --> 30:44.555
Fuck, that's enough.

30:44.557 --> 30:46.393
What's wrong with you?

31:07.981 --> 31:09.584
Let me have a look.

31:13.420 --> 31:15.023
Maybe he's right.

31:16.356 --> 31:17.488
Maybe I shouldn't be doing this.

31:17.490 --> 31:19.524
Aw hey, don't
let anyone tell you

31:19.526 --> 31:22.093
what you can and can't do.

31:22.095 --> 31:23.195
If he wants to be
stuck in the stone age

31:23.197 --> 31:25.964
then you let him do that.

31:25.966 --> 31:29.001
Just worry about yourself and
what you want to do, okay?

31:29.003 --> 31:29.668
Okay.

31:29.670 --> 31:30.502
Okay.

31:30.504 --> 31:31.539
Yeah.

31:34.141 --> 31:35.172
Is it true?

31:35.174 --> 31:36.374
What?

31:36.376 --> 31:38.512
Your brother got murdered.

31:40.514 --> 31:43.450
Right, get
yourself cleaned up.

31:51.592 --> 31:52.493
Hey Billie.

31:53.459 --> 31:54.895
That's good work.

32:12.078 --> 32:13.411
Robert.

32:13.413 --> 32:14.248
What?

32:15.215 --> 32:16.081
I need to talk son.

32:16.083 --> 32:17.215
No.

32:17.217 --> 32:18.449
About Danny.

32:18.451 --> 32:19.650
I don't care,
nothing's changed.

32:19.652 --> 32:20.451
- Wait a sec, wait a sec.
- No.

32:20.453 --> 32:21.218
Not right now all right?

32:21.220 --> 32:22.222
I'm leaving.

32:23.123 --> 32:25.390
We can go and get a drink.

32:25.392 --> 32:29.727
What makes you think I want
to have a drink with you?

32:29.729 --> 32:31.964
Now you listen to me,
take off your gloves.

32:31.966 --> 32:33.332
- Oh come on.
- And you go over here.

32:33.334 --> 32:34.399
You're drunk already
I can fucking

32:34.401 --> 32:35.367
- smell it on ya.
- I'm not drunk.

32:35.369 --> 32:36.668
No, I mean really.

32:36.670 --> 32:38.070
It takes one of your sons to die

32:38.072 --> 32:39.236
before you can come talk to me?

32:39.238 --> 32:40.706
Did you know
Danny was murdered?

32:40.708 --> 32:42.541
He was beaten to a pulp,

32:42.543 --> 32:45.509
and I know that because
he called me the night.

32:45.511 --> 32:47.012
He called me.

32:47.014 --> 32:47.746
He called you?

32:47.748 --> 32:50.748
Aye, but I didn't pick up.

32:50.750 --> 32:52.583
I thought maybe
you could tell me...

32:52.585 --> 32:54.518
I thought you came to see me.

32:54.520 --> 32:55.687
Did come to see you
but I thought maybe...

32:55.689 --> 32:57.621
You don't even care about me.

32:57.623 --> 32:59.690
You're only here to find
out about Danny aren't you?

32:59.692 --> 33:00.661
I came to...

33:02.496 --> 33:03.762
Get my son back.

33:46.172 --> 33:48.140
So how was
your date last night?

33:48.142 --> 33:48.977
Short.

33:50.110 --> 33:52.544
No coffee afterwards then?

33:52.546 --> 33:55.447
We match on Tinder,
decide to go for a drink.

33:55.449 --> 33:57.681
Hear about his day before
he even asked about mine

33:57.683 --> 33:59.618
he's more concerned what
was underneath my skirt.

33:59.620 --> 34:01.352
So yes, short.

34:01.354 --> 34:02.190
Men aye?

34:03.757 --> 34:06.824
So they're telling us
there are no CCTV cameras

34:06.826 --> 34:09.127
pointed toward the area
where he was killed,

34:09.129 --> 34:11.596
why do I find that
hard to believe?

34:11.598 --> 34:13.264
A trading company
doesn't have funds

34:13.266 --> 34:17.234
to keep cameras on the whole
site 24/7, down at 8:00.

34:17.235 --> 34:18.670
It
doesn't feel right.

34:18.672 --> 34:20.571
What do you think?

34:20.572 --> 34:22.406
About Tinder?

34:22.408 --> 34:24.411
That doesn't feel right.

34:25.812 --> 34:27.078
Patrick.

34:27.080 --> 34:28.679
I'm gonna pay him a visit.

34:28.681 --> 34:31.116
He seems to be the weak
link in this operation.

34:31.118 --> 34:32.384
Maybe we can make him flip.

34:32.386 --> 34:34.485
Well that isn't
a good idea is it?

34:34.487 --> 34:36.687
The last thing we want is Shaw
to think we're on his case.

34:36.688 --> 34:38.355
That's exactly what we want.

34:38.357 --> 34:39.757
Start on operations
until we convict him.

34:39.759 --> 34:42.226
Don't make me pull
rank Bernadette.

34:42.228 --> 34:43.527
Just relax.

34:43.529 --> 34:45.730
We will get the
person responsible.

34:45.732 --> 34:48.466
Look, so what do we know, hmm?

34:48.467 --> 34:49.569
We know Shaw.

34:50.735 --> 34:51.569
He's definitely got
some kind of link

34:51.571 --> 34:54.105
to this human
trafficking racket.

34:54.107 --> 34:56.708
Let's just sit tight and
see how things develop, aye?

34:56.710 --> 34:58.143
'Cause I know one
of they bastards

34:58.145 --> 35:00.312
most definitely
killed my nephew,

35:00.314 --> 35:04.348
but we can bring down more
than just a man with a gun.

35:04.350 --> 35:08.286
We need to nail the bastard
that finances the gun remember?

35:08.288 --> 35:09.687
Cold.

35:09.689 --> 35:10.323
But true.

35:17.698 --> 35:19.364
Well what is this?

35:19.366 --> 35:20.799
You said a small event.

35:20.801 --> 35:22.266
If the council
found out about this

35:22.268 --> 35:24.536
they're gonna close us down.

35:24.538 --> 35:25.737
Don't be a faggot, just relax.

35:25.739 --> 35:27.205
No one's gonna find out.

35:27.207 --> 35:28.573
First the drugs and
now unlicensed boxing?

35:28.575 --> 35:30.578
I could wring your neck.

35:31.444 --> 35:32.546
Oh fuck sake.

35:33.846 --> 35:34.879
Robert.

35:34.881 --> 35:35.813
Robert.

35:35.815 --> 35:37.482
Not right now all right?

35:37.484 --> 35:39.283
Listen, I need
to speak with Jessica.

35:39.285 --> 35:40.185
What?

35:40.187 --> 35:40.919
Jessica.

35:40.921 --> 35:42.554
No I heard what you said.

35:42.556 --> 35:43.788
Good.

35:43.790 --> 35:44.688
So do you know where
I can find her?

35:44.690 --> 35:45.725
No.

35:46.926 --> 35:47.759
Okay a number then.

35:47.761 --> 35:48.692
What is your problem?

35:48.694 --> 35:49.861
Why do you want to see her?

35:49.863 --> 35:51.263
Son she's carrying
my grandchild.

35:51.265 --> 35:52.330
Yeah, and like I'm
gonna let you near her.

35:52.332 --> 35:53.265
Listen...

35:53.267 --> 35:55.833
No I'm not listening to you.

35:55.835 --> 35:58.170
No one is useless
in this world.

35:58.172 --> 35:59.670
He lightens the
burdens of another.

35:59.672 --> 36:00.504
What?

36:00.506 --> 36:01.739
Dickens.

36:01.741 --> 36:02.806
Here we go with all
your attempt at wisdom.

36:02.808 --> 36:04.442
Whoopdte fucking doo!

36:04.444 --> 36:05.710
Mom was the smart one.

36:05.712 --> 36:06.944
The suit don't fit.

36:06.946 --> 36:11.583
Don't take another fucking
step until I've said my piece.

36:11.585 --> 36:14.518
Danny's gone, we've lost him.

36:14.520 --> 36:17.355
It's tearing me apart that
I wasn't there for him,

36:17.357 --> 36:20.625
but I can be there for Jessica
and the baby, now please.

36:20.627 --> 36:21.893
Robert.

36:21.895 --> 36:22.928
People are waiting, we
need another fighter.

36:22.930 --> 36:23.862
Tennison's all ready.

36:23.864 --> 36:24.895
What?

36:24.897 --> 36:25.830
I'm not gonna help you.

36:25.832 --> 36:27.199
You taught that, throw
one of the kids in.

36:27.201 --> 36:27.832
Are you mad?

36:27.834 --> 36:28.866
No way!

36:28.868 --> 36:29.801
No!

36:29.803 --> 36:30.601
What are you on about no way?

36:30.603 --> 36:31.368
Who are you to say that?

36:31.370 --> 36:32.304
Who are you?

36:32.306 --> 36:32.904
You get one of your boys.

36:32.906 --> 36:34.371
I'll fight Meat.

36:34.373 --> 36:35.574
You, who are you you jackass.

36:37.777 --> 36:38.609
I'll give you 10.

36:38.611 --> 36:39.544
You're a village boy.

36:39.546 --> 36:40.844
I'll give you 10 minutes.

36:40.846 --> 36:43.214
- Sort this out.
- I'm sorry mate, come on.

36:51.892 --> 36:53.794
Why are you doing this?

37:21.421 --> 37:22.489
Who's that?

37:36.602 --> 37:38.837
When I say break,
I mean break.

37:38.839 --> 37:39.674
Got that?

37:40.841 --> 37:43.210
Get back to your corners.

37:47.614 --> 37:48.879
He swings big.

37:48.881 --> 37:50.951
Move around, make him miss.

37:55.622 --> 37:56.453
Ready?

37:56.455 --> 37:57.989
Let's fight.

38:22.748 --> 38:23.580
Break!

38:23.582 --> 38:24.684
None of that!

38:30.022 --> 38:30.857
Fight!

38:42.435 --> 38:44.034
He's out!

39:02.723 --> 39:03.754
See?

39:03.756 --> 39:05.022
Wasn't so hard was it?

39:05.024 --> 39:06.558
Whatever.

39:06.560 --> 39:07.558
He's a good fighter.

39:07.560 --> 39:08.592
Where'd you find him.

39:08.594 --> 39:09.861
He's my father.

39:09.863 --> 39:10.828
Sweet.

39:10.830 --> 39:11.663
I'd best be off.

39:11.665 --> 39:12.663
I'll be in touch.

39:12.665 --> 39:14.901
I'm sure you will.

39:18.739 --> 39:20.041
No, you keep it.

39:27.381 --> 39:28.645
About Jessica.

39:28.647 --> 39:29.848
Look, I know what
you're trying to do

39:29.850 --> 39:31.516
but now is not the right time.

39:31.518 --> 39:32.884
So when is?

39:32.886 --> 39:34.051
You fighting for me doesn't

39:34.053 --> 39:35.754
immediately put
things back together.

39:35.756 --> 39:38.623
If you really care you'll give
her the space that she needs.

39:38.625 --> 39:39.727
Understood.

39:45.064 --> 39:48.600
And don't be coming
down here uninvited again.

39:48.602 --> 39:51.002
I know where to find
you if I need you.

40:41.922 --> 40:43.120
I got this.

40:43.122 --> 40:43.957
Okay.

40:52.031 --> 40:53.630
You ordering food?

40:53.632 --> 40:54.468
Aye.

41:13.118 --> 41:14.120
May I sit?

41:20.026 --> 41:22.060
My boy tells me you
put on quite a show

41:22.062 --> 41:24.064
down at the gym tonight.

41:26.966 --> 41:28.165
Coffee?

41:28.167 --> 41:31.504
I'll have what he's
having sweetheart.

41:32.571 --> 41:34.138
So why'd you fight?

41:34.140 --> 41:35.073
You tight for money?

41:35.075 --> 41:36.174
No.

41:36.176 --> 41:39.143
You chasing the adrenaline?

41:39.145 --> 41:41.779
I know, it's appealing.

41:41.781 --> 41:43.683
I used to fight myself.

41:46.919 --> 41:47.954
I have a problem.

41:51.190 --> 41:55.158
Your little show down at
the gym cost me a fighter.

41:55.160 --> 41:58.830
His jaw is broken and he
can't fight next week.

41:58.832 --> 42:03.835
So, you gonna help me fix
my problem and fight for me?

42:03.837 --> 42:06.603
I have my own problems.

42:06.605 --> 42:08.772
You know who I am?

42:08.774 --> 42:10.708
I've heard of you.

42:10.710 --> 42:14.112
You're a suspect
in my son's murder.

42:14.114 --> 42:15.049
Am I now?

42:18.250 --> 42:19.118
You're brave.

42:20.252 --> 42:21.219
I can respect that.

42:21.221 --> 42:23.257
Say your piece and leave.

42:26.292 --> 42:30.663
When I was a kid my ma
used to make these brownies.

42:31.631 --> 42:33.598
They were to die for.

42:33.600 --> 42:37.134
Now, the rule was you
could only take one,

42:37.136 --> 42:39.703
but I couldn't help myself.

42:39.705 --> 42:42.239
I would take two or even three.

42:42.241 --> 42:44.007
My older brothers
would beat the shit

42:44.009 --> 42:46.109
out of me for taking theirs.

42:46.111 --> 42:49.047
It wasn't that I
was being greedy.

42:49.049 --> 42:51.149
Sometimes I wasn't even hungry.

42:51.151 --> 42:53.717
I just like getting
into trouble,

42:53.719 --> 42:56.790
and I liked taking
what was not mine.

42:57.823 --> 42:58.723
What's your point?

43:01.361 --> 43:04.228
Wakes up the
senses doesn't it?

43:04.230 --> 43:06.630
So you can fight for me,

43:06.632 --> 43:10.803
and then you can get on with
your life as if we never met.

43:12.205 --> 43:13.306
If I don't?

43:14.707 --> 43:16.643
Then I will find you.

43:17.777 --> 43:20.548
And I will take
something from you.

43:22.181 --> 43:26.750
My boy, I didn't see
him for three years,

43:26.752 --> 43:29.353
and he calls me up
the night he died.

43:29.355 --> 43:33.223
All I heard was the sounds of
him getting beaten to death.

43:33.225 --> 43:36.326
Now you're telling me
you weren't involved.

43:36.328 --> 43:39.897
If you were, you won't
need to come find me.

43:39.899 --> 43:41.067
I'll find you.

43:49.676 --> 43:51.344
Enjoy your coffee.

43:55.181 --> 43:59.019
Give me a call when
you've made your decision.

44:21.006 --> 44:22.275
Who was that?

44:23.442 --> 44:24.978
My new friend.

44:26.913 --> 44:28.215
So, you work here.

44:30.350 --> 44:33.319
No, I just like
wearing the uniform.

44:35.254 --> 44:37.190
It is a nice uniform.

45:08.254 --> 45:09.690
Hey, you awake?

45:14.259 --> 45:17.031
I just want to
let you know that,

45:19.732 --> 45:21.834
you're not alone in this.

45:23.169 --> 45:24.004
Okay?

45:32.277 --> 45:33.111
Amy.

45:33.113 --> 45:34.312
Oh.

45:34.314 --> 45:36.446
What are you still doing here?

45:36.448 --> 45:37.281
Thought I'd escort you home.

45:37.283 --> 45:39.884
Bit late to be
walking on your own.

45:39.886 --> 45:41.284
Yeah, sure.

45:41.286 --> 45:42.120
Where do you live?

45:42.122 --> 45:43.020
Saint Mary's.

45:43.022 --> 45:44.522
Whoa, you train there?

45:44.524 --> 45:47.357
Yeah, you
regretting your offer?

45:47.359 --> 45:49.359
Course not, anyway
I've committed.

45:49.361 --> 45:50.928
Come on, let's go.

45:50.930 --> 45:51.763
Okay.

46:19.459 --> 46:20.326
Does it hurt?

46:22.161 --> 46:23.995
What, my face?

46:23.997 --> 46:24.995
No.

46:24.997 --> 46:26.364
Back does.

46:26.366 --> 46:28.302
Too old to be boxing.

46:29.435 --> 46:30.938
Why'd you do it?

46:33.038 --> 46:34.341
Primal instinct?

46:35.575 --> 46:38.475
It's the will to fight.

46:38.477 --> 46:40.411
I tell ya, you
may not believe it

46:40.413 --> 46:42.513
but it's an amazing experience
getting punched in the face

46:42.515 --> 46:45.516
and finding out you're
not made of glass.

46:45.518 --> 46:46.917
It's almost poetic.

46:47.553 --> 46:48.921
Almost, aye.

46:52.991 --> 46:55.292
Do you get on with your folks?

46:55.294 --> 46:56.493
Yeah.

46:56.495 --> 46:57.895
Now anyway.

46:57.897 --> 46:59.297
Now?

46:59.299 --> 47:01.866
My parents never
wanted me to do English.

47:01.868 --> 47:02.503
Why not?

47:05.171 --> 47:07.504
They wanted me to joint
the family business.

47:07.506 --> 47:08.538
Oh?

47:08.540 --> 47:09.375
IT.

47:10.609 --> 47:14.413
I finally saw they started to
appreciate me for who I was.

47:15.381 --> 47:17.214
How come you chose English?

47:17.216 --> 47:19.382
Are you kidding?

47:21.120 --> 47:23.286
I could spout all day about it.

47:23.288 --> 47:24.357
Go on then.

47:29.529 --> 47:31.228
I think it's fascinating
how even though

47:31.230 --> 47:35.401
mankind has changed so much
over the last 1,000 years,

47:36.402 --> 47:40.007
the same basic themes
endure in literature.

47:41.908 --> 47:45.542
And the devotion and
time people spend

47:45.544 --> 47:47.478
on novels that
they choose to read

47:47.480 --> 47:50.248
and how that novel
because part of your life

47:50.250 --> 47:52.415
for that week or two
that you're reading it.

47:52.417 --> 47:54.150
You know I've often thought that

47:54.152 --> 47:55.585
something was
missing in my life,

47:55.587 --> 47:58.489
and I thought if I could
just read everything

47:58.491 --> 48:02.462
and consume everything I'd
find out what that was but...

48:03.629 --> 48:06.933
Ah, I won't bore you
with the details.

48:10.535 --> 48:11.437
So, what?

48:12.571 --> 48:13.571
You committed all that to memory

48:13.573 --> 48:15.538
just in case someone asked you?

48:15.540 --> 48:16.375
Nice work.

48:18.944 --> 48:20.544
And you?

48:20.546 --> 48:21.515
Literature?

48:26.518 --> 48:28.421
That's for another day.

48:46.538 --> 48:49.042
♪ I wanna run

48:53.279 --> 48:56.080
♪ I wanna run

48:56.082 --> 48:59.553

49:01.321 --> 49:04.654

Can I help you?

50:21.701 --> 50:23.134
What did we tell you?

50:23.136 --> 50:24.567
What did you tell me?

50:24.569 --> 50:26.670
You snooping around isn't
helping the situation.

50:26.672 --> 50:27.605
I'm not snooping.

50:27.607 --> 50:29.473
You been talking to Shaw?

50:29.475 --> 50:30.641
How'd you know that?

50:30.643 --> 50:32.375
Because we're
having him monitored.

50:32.377 --> 50:33.747
He approached me.

50:38.817 --> 50:40.717
Can I get in?

50:40.719 --> 50:42.622
Give us a second will ya?

50:43.723 --> 50:45.592
Why are you on my case?

50:47.393 --> 50:49.726
Look I have to ask you,

50:49.728 --> 50:51.594
where were you on the
night of Danny's murder?

50:51.596 --> 50:53.763
At home, I told you already.

50:53.765 --> 50:55.199
Well a caretaker
of the university

50:55.201 --> 50:58.234
says you were here late,
left about 8:00 p.m.

50:58.236 --> 50:59.703
Aye, I was working late.

50:59.705 --> 51:01.371
What am I a suspect now?

51:01.373 --> 51:03.406
No, I'm only asking because
your number on his phone

51:03.408 --> 51:05.509
is the only piece
of evidence we have.

51:05.511 --> 51:07.444
Aye I heard.

51:07.446 --> 51:08.745
With modern technology
you'd expect

51:08.747 --> 51:10.681
a wee bit more wouldn't you?

51:10.683 --> 51:12.382
Sounds to me like
someone's hiding something.

51:12.384 --> 51:13.518
Oh come on.

51:13.520 --> 51:14.685
How else are they getting
away with this Charlie?

51:14.687 --> 51:16.120
They're not.

51:16.122 --> 51:17.855
They are, they are,
this fucking prick Shaw,

51:17.857 --> 51:20.658
have you even
questioned him yet?

51:20.660 --> 51:21.826
You know he got
right up in my face

51:21.828 --> 51:24.295
and practically admitted
to killing my son.

51:24.297 --> 51:27.098
William you need to go
home and get some rest.

51:27.100 --> 51:29.299
You look exhausted.

51:29.301 --> 51:31.402
Christ I hate seeing
you like this.

51:31.404 --> 51:32.636
You're grieving.

51:32.638 --> 51:35.806
You need to be with your family.

51:35.808 --> 51:36.810
My family.

51:38.410 --> 51:39.643
I'm gonna ask you one more time.

51:39.645 --> 51:42.082
Have you questioned Shaw yet?

51:44.216 --> 51:45.516
How can you sit here telling me

51:45.518 --> 51:47.118
what to do about my son's murder

51:47.120 --> 51:48.786
when you're not even
doing your job properly.

51:48.788 --> 51:49.721
Hey!

51:49.723 --> 51:52.156
I loved your son like
was my own right.

51:52.158 --> 51:53.424
Is that right?

51:53.426 --> 51:54.824
Then how come you're
here in my car with me

51:54.826 --> 51:56.493
instead of out there
finding the person

51:56.495 --> 51:58.596
fucking responsible for this.

51:58.598 --> 51:59.830
Just calm down.

51:59.832 --> 52:01.632
I tell you what
Charlie, get the fuck out.

52:01.634 --> 52:03.801
- Get the fuck out!
- All right!

52:03.803 --> 52:04.667
Aye I'm going.

52:04.669 --> 52:05.638
Good.

52:39.538 --> 52:40.372
Robert?

53:35.227 --> 53:36.659
Oh fuck!

53:36.661 --> 53:37.861
Fuck!

53:37.863 --> 53:39.263
Hey, hey!

53:39.265 --> 53:40.464
Talk to me.

53:40.466 --> 53:42.266
Speak to me, say
something to me!

53:42.268 --> 53:42.903
Help!

53:57.283 --> 53:59.618
It'll be a moment.

54:19.538 --> 54:20.670
What have you done?

54:20.672 --> 54:21.904
What have you done?

54:21.906 --> 54:23.373
Get the fuck off me!

54:25.645 --> 54:27.678
I fucking hate you.

54:27.680 --> 54:28.515
Jessica!

54:30.515 --> 54:31.448
Jessica.

54:31.450 --> 54:32.252
Jessica.

54:33.051 --> 54:34.254
Green tea.

54:34.986 --> 54:36.587
With toast every morning.

54:36.589 --> 54:37.487
Are you okay?

54:37.489 --> 54:38.422
What happened to you?

54:38.424 --> 54:40.891
Danny always made it for me.

54:40.893 --> 54:43.230
Your son was good like that.

54:44.062 --> 54:45.763
I miss him so much.

54:45.765 --> 54:47.931
You're all right.

54:47.933 --> 54:50.701
Never trusted that Patrick.

54:50.703 --> 54:51.634
What?

54:51.636 --> 54:53.737
No, why did I let him do it?

54:53.739 --> 54:54.971
He said we needed some
money for the baby

54:54.973 --> 54:56.774
and I agreed with
him I don't know.

54:56.776 --> 54:59.009
Hey, hey, hey, hey Jess,
what do you know, Jess?

54:59.011 --> 55:00.444
Jess, what do you know?

55:00.446 --> 55:03.382
I was there the
night he got killed.

55:05.051 --> 55:06.850
Are you sure she's
telling the truth?

55:06.852 --> 55:08.518
She nearly died today.

55:08.520 --> 55:09.652
Tried to take her
own life so she

55:09.654 --> 55:11.855
could be with my son God's sake.

55:11.857 --> 55:14.625
She's not lying, why would she?

55:14.627 --> 55:16.893
I'll ride up, just relax.

55:16.895 --> 55:19.029
If she is telling the truth
then this is no joke William.

55:19.031 --> 55:20.864
No shit.

55:20.866 --> 55:22.065
Leave her with me.

55:22.067 --> 55:25.002
You need to lie low, go home
and wait for my call, okay?

55:25.004 --> 55:28.105
No, it's too risky
to take her home.

55:28.107 --> 55:31.007
As soon as Shaw finds out she
was there he'll be after her.

55:31.009 --> 55:32.942
Assuming he doesn't
know already.

55:32.944 --> 55:37.614
William I don't know
if I can protect you.

55:37.616 --> 55:40.516
He has people everywhere,
including the police.

55:40.518 --> 55:41.851
You got a better idea?

55:41.853 --> 55:44.654
Aye, go to the old cottage.

55:44.656 --> 55:46.890
You'll be safe enough there.

55:46.892 --> 55:47.958
Okay.

55:47.960 --> 55:49.125
Keep me posted.

55:49.127 --> 55:51.362
Listen I gotta go, I'll
speak to you in a bit, okay?

55:51.364 --> 55:52.632
All right, bye.

55:55.734 --> 55:57.967
All right let's check
the crates in the back.

55:57.969 --> 56:00.002
But we've still
got a few left.

56:00.004 --> 56:00.971
Nah,
this place is dry.

56:00.973 --> 56:01.938
Too out in the open.

56:01.940 --> 56:02.975
Come on.

56:26.966 --> 56:30.337
Jessica, I've got
something for you.

56:39.712 --> 56:41.478
So when's it due?

56:41.480 --> 56:42.549
Four weeks.

56:43.549 --> 56:44.984
Hell of a bump.

56:45.917 --> 56:46.986
It's a boy.

56:55.660 --> 56:59.862
When Danny was a boy we
used to call him bumpy.

56:59.864 --> 57:02.665
Before he got contacts
he had glasses,

57:02.667 --> 57:05.569
which he never
wore, he hated them.

57:05.571 --> 57:07.870
But he used to chase Robert
through the living room

57:07.872 --> 57:11.507
and got smacked into
the door frame everyday.

57:11.509 --> 57:15.045
His head used to come
up like a cartoon.

57:15.047 --> 57:16.513
It's crazy how the time goes.

57:16.515 --> 57:18.752
I'll go pack your things.

57:23.888 --> 57:25.989
Can I say something?

57:25.991 --> 57:26.993
Of course.

57:29.727 --> 57:30.996
I'm so sorry.

57:32.730 --> 57:33.565
For...

57:37.069 --> 57:41.040
I know how selfish it was and
I won't ever forgive myself.

57:42.575 --> 57:44.574
Don't explain yourself,
you don't have to.

57:44.576 --> 57:46.042
You're alive.

57:46.044 --> 57:47.044
You're healthy.

57:47.046 --> 57:48.645
The baby's healthy.

57:48.647 --> 57:50.980
You can start
rebuilding your life.

57:50.982 --> 57:52.549
I don't know how
much Danny told you

57:52.551 --> 57:54.984
about why we never talked but,

57:54.986 --> 57:57.620
I used to think I had
the perfect life too.

57:57.622 --> 58:00.556
I did, I had a boxing career.

58:00.558 --> 58:02.158
I broke my back.

58:02.160 --> 58:03.195
Lost it.

58:04.163 --> 58:06.830
Danny's mom got ill with cancer,

58:06.832 --> 58:11.004
and just when I thought
things couldn't get any worse,

58:12.238 --> 58:13.605
I became this,

58:15.540 --> 58:16.176
awful dad.

58:17.609 --> 58:20.676
Social services
took my boys away.

58:20.678 --> 58:22.279
You know the expression
all that can happen to you

58:22.281 --> 58:23.913
will happen to you?

58:23.915 --> 58:25.248
Well it's true.

58:25.250 --> 58:27.817
In my case it was anyway.

58:27.819 --> 58:29.252
What I'm trying to
say is a part of me

58:29.254 --> 58:33.223
feels that some of that
happened because of who I was,

58:33.225 --> 58:36.259
because of how I
was as a person.

58:36.261 --> 58:38.194
So I'm saying be strong.

58:38.196 --> 58:40.263
Don't make the mistakes I did.

58:40.265 --> 58:43.165
Else your baby's gonna
grow to resent you.

58:43.167 --> 58:45.238
Danny never resented you.

58:50.241 --> 58:53.109
I can't remember
where you went wrong boy.

58:53.111 --> 58:54.344
Hmm?

58:54.346 --> 58:56.913
You thought it would be a
good idea to just let them go?

58:56.915 --> 58:57.748
I thought you...

58:57.750 --> 58:59.549
Don't think!

58:59.551 --> 59:02.152
Your brain doesn't
have the energy for it.

59:02.154 --> 59:04.824
Don't do anything, just go home.

59:05.723 --> 59:06.558
Go!

59:08.727 --> 59:10.830
Fucking hell.

59:12.096 --> 59:14.565
Your brother's becoming
a bit of a problem.

59:14.567 --> 59:16.567
Well what do you expect?

59:16.569 --> 59:18.171
You killed his son.

59:20.272 --> 59:23.005
You need to relax Desmond.

59:23.007 --> 59:26.275
I'll relax when they're
12 feet under the ground.

59:26.277 --> 59:29.279
You need to understand the
seriousness of this situation.

59:29.281 --> 59:32.049
And how to you
propose I sort it, eh?

59:32.051 --> 59:34.554
Maybe just turn up, kill them?

59:36.888 --> 59:39.558
You're out of your fucking mind.

59:40.292 --> 59:41.728
So, what now?

59:43.962 --> 59:45.295
They're heading to
our late grandmother's

59:45.297 --> 59:47.196
house in the highlands.

59:47.198 --> 59:48.332
The old cottage.

59:48.334 --> 59:51.368
It's where we spent
summers as kids.

59:51.370 --> 59:53.203
It's quiet there.

59:53.205 --> 59:55.038
I'll link you
with my son Luke.

59:55.040 --> 59:58.241
But you keep my brother
and Robbie out of it.

59:58.243 --> 01:00:03.145
Enough of my family's bloods
been spilled as it is.

01:00:03.147 --> 01:00:05.852
This is where I draw the line.

01:01:26.098 --> 01:01:29.165
This is where you grew up?

01:01:29.167 --> 01:01:30.002
Aye.

01:01:30.935 --> 01:01:31.937
It's nice.

01:02:28.292 --> 01:02:29.361
Need the loo.

01:02:37.935 --> 01:02:39.471
How you holding up?

01:02:41.140 --> 01:02:45.078
There's no words to
describe how I'm feeling.

01:02:49.480 --> 01:02:50.850
Do you mind?

01:03:02.326 --> 01:03:06.431
Used to play this all the
time when you were a kid.

01:03:08.567 --> 01:03:12.939
We'd each choose a piece to
represent ourselves didn't we?

01:03:14.071 --> 01:03:16.308
You remember your favorite?

01:03:17.975 --> 01:03:19.542
The knight.

01:03:19.544 --> 01:03:21.178
Aye.

01:03:21.180 --> 01:03:22.444
Why was that?

01:03:22.446 --> 01:03:24.480
It was because of the shape.

01:03:24.482 --> 01:03:26.084
And how it moved.

01:03:28.553 --> 01:03:31.089
I'd like to say something.

01:03:32.524 --> 01:03:36.326
I know I was supposed to
be there for you and Danny.

01:03:36.328 --> 01:03:38.895
When your mother died I
should've been there for you.

01:03:38.897 --> 01:03:43.433
Even more than ever, but I
couldn't grasp the situation

01:03:43.435 --> 01:03:46.873
and I just imploded,
and I left you both.

01:03:48.540 --> 01:03:51.473
But you didn't do anything
wrong, you know that?

01:03:51.475 --> 01:03:53.478
How could you have done?

01:03:54.346 --> 01:03:55.848
My beautiful boys.

01:03:58.250 --> 01:04:01.116
And I tried to swallow
all my memories

01:04:01.118 --> 01:04:03.288
with booze and medication.

01:04:05.323 --> 01:04:09.494
Tried to forget I had a family,
but of course I couldn't.

01:04:10.928 --> 01:04:14.431
What really haunts me is
I know I failed you both,

01:04:14.433 --> 01:04:18.500
and I know it's probably
too late and you hate me,

01:04:18.502 --> 01:04:22.107
but I would like to be
a part of your life.

01:04:24.109 --> 01:04:25.507
If you'll have me.

01:05:06.451 --> 01:05:07.286
Shit.

01:05:08.386 --> 01:05:09.486
Shit!

01:05:09.488 --> 01:05:10.487
What?

01:05:10.489 --> 01:05:11.987
Who is it?

01:05:11.989 --> 01:05:13.323
Shaw's son.

01:05:13.325 --> 01:05:14.257
Patrick?

01:05:14.259 --> 01:05:16.259
The other one!

01:05:16.261 --> 01:05:18.361
What are we gonna do?

01:05:18.363 --> 01:05:19.629
Take her in there, hide her.

01:05:19.631 --> 01:05:21.364
Why have you got a sword?

01:05:21.366 --> 01:05:22.198
What?

01:05:22.200 --> 01:05:23.134
Hide her!

01:05:24.502 --> 01:05:25.504
Come here.

01:05:29.640 --> 01:05:31.074
What's going on?

01:05:31.076 --> 01:05:32.042
You know they're
here for you right?

01:05:32.044 --> 01:05:32.942
And I need to keep you safe.

01:05:32.944 --> 01:05:33.576
I can help.

01:05:33.578 --> 01:05:34.476
No, you can't.

01:05:34.478 --> 01:05:35.478
- Yes I can!
- No.

01:05:35.480 --> 01:05:36.980
- Jess, you can't.
- Robert I can!

01:05:36.982 --> 01:05:37.617
Robert.

01:05:48.292 --> 01:05:49.594
Well here he is.

01:05:51.596 --> 01:05:52.665
Where is she?

01:05:54.031 --> 01:05:54.933
Not here.

01:05:59.971 --> 01:06:02.408
Put the fucking blade down.

01:06:03.408 --> 01:06:04.239
Don't be a hero.

01:06:04.241 --> 01:06:05.544
We know she's here.

01:06:25.529 --> 01:06:27.533
Let's have a bit of fun.

01:06:48.553 --> 01:06:50.556
A fucking samurai sword?

01:06:53.392 --> 01:06:54.393
Fuck's sake.

01:06:56.395 --> 01:06:57.730
Fucking bastard.

01:07:01.433 --> 01:07:02.268
Shit.

01:07:10.609 --> 01:07:13.578
Where the fuck
did you come from?

01:07:15.080 --> 01:07:15.712
Stop it!

01:07:15.714 --> 01:07:16.748
Stop it!

01:07:32.663 --> 01:07:34.830
I'd put that down darling
before you get hurt.

01:07:34.832 --> 01:07:37.266
Don't take another step.

01:07:37.268 --> 01:07:38.734
What you gonna do?

01:07:38.736 --> 01:07:39.771
Shoot me?

01:07:41.339 --> 01:07:44.440
You don't have
the nerve darling.

01:07:44.442 --> 01:07:45.276
Go on.

01:07:46.678 --> 01:07:47.513
Jessica.

01:07:49.681 --> 01:07:51.181
Right there.

01:07:51.183 --> 01:07:53.083
Jessica give me the gun.

01:07:53.085 --> 01:07:53.783
Do it.

01:07:55.520 --> 01:07:59.625
Jessica, darling, darling,
you give me the gun.

01:08:01.192 --> 01:08:02.727
Oh give us a break.

01:08:04.129 --> 01:08:05.498
You're no better.

01:08:07.698 --> 01:08:08.698
You're not gonna shoot me.

01:08:08.700 --> 01:08:10.335
Get in the car.

01:08:20.578 --> 01:08:24.250
Do you know why I
know you won't shoot me?

01:08:26.484 --> 01:08:29.384
Because it's not in your blood.

01:08:29.386 --> 01:08:33.224
You know I was there the
night Dan got killed.

01:08:34.725 --> 01:08:36.758
All for not pulling a trigger?

01:08:40.532 --> 01:08:43.165
Scared little bitch he was.

01:08:43.167 --> 01:08:44.569
Just like his da.

01:08:46.270 --> 01:08:47.104
Don't.

01:08:47.839 --> 01:08:49.608
Won't it feel good.

01:08:53.812 --> 01:08:54.647
Why not?

01:09:03.487 --> 01:09:05.356
Da, come on!

01:09:06.256 --> 01:09:07.093
Come on!

01:09:17.402 --> 01:09:18.700
How'd they find us?

01:09:18.702 --> 01:09:19.734
I don't know.

01:09:19.737 --> 01:09:22.237
It had to be Uncle
Charlie, no one else knew.

01:09:22.238 --> 01:09:24.874
'Cause you wouldn't
listen to what I said.

01:09:24.876 --> 01:09:25.707
Me?

01:09:25.710 --> 01:09:26.642
Yes you.

01:09:26.644 --> 01:09:27.511
I told you to stay in the house.

01:09:27.513 --> 01:09:29.178
I told you to take
care of yourself.

01:09:29.180 --> 01:09:30.412
Are you fucking serious?

01:09:30.415 --> 01:09:31.346
Right,
if it wasn't for me

01:09:31.349 --> 01:09:32.749
you'd both be fucking dead.

01:09:32.751 --> 01:09:34.683
Oh yeah, you could've
killed yourself as well.

01:09:34.685 --> 01:09:36.218
- Fucking serious man!
- Calm down.

01:09:36.220 --> 01:09:37.953
No I'm
not gonna calm down!

01:09:37.956 --> 01:09:38.921
Yeah I know what's happened.

01:09:38.924 --> 01:09:40.756
Calm the fuck down.

01:09:58.542 --> 01:10:00.910
We better get going.

01:10:00.912 --> 01:10:02.344
He's not gonna stop you know.

01:10:02.346 --> 01:10:03.213
What?

01:10:03.215 --> 01:10:03.849
Shaw.

01:10:04.882 --> 01:10:06.251
He won't stop.

01:10:07.652 --> 01:10:09.552
I'm gonna have to talk to him.

01:10:09.554 --> 01:10:12.754
And how do you
plan on doing that?

01:10:12.756 --> 01:10:14.557
He owns a club right?

01:10:14.559 --> 01:10:16.359
And?

01:10:16.361 --> 01:10:17.694
Why don't you take me there?

01:10:17.696 --> 01:10:18.660
Are you crazy?

01:10:18.662 --> 01:10:19.896
Son.

01:10:19.898 --> 01:10:21.864
See now I know why you
were the way you where

01:10:21.866 --> 01:10:23.865
when I was growing.

01:10:23.867 --> 01:10:25.468
See you're not
right in the head.

01:10:25.470 --> 01:10:26.302
Robert.

01:10:26.304 --> 01:10:26.939
No!

01:10:31.542 --> 01:10:32.377
Robert.

01:10:34.246 --> 01:10:35.645
Look.

01:10:35.647 --> 01:10:37.446
Who are you?

01:10:37.448 --> 01:10:38.815
I'm you father's who I am.

01:10:38.817 --> 01:10:40.917
Aye where you there
when I was growing up?

01:10:40.919 --> 01:10:41.884
Oh what?

01:10:41.886 --> 01:10:44.686
I said where you there
when I was growing up?

01:10:44.688 --> 01:10:45.855
No.

01:10:45.857 --> 01:10:47.957
Then you're not my father.

01:10:47.959 --> 01:10:49.859
I know it doesn't
make up for what I did

01:10:49.861 --> 01:10:51.526
but I'm telling you
I'm gonna change.

01:10:51.528 --> 01:10:52.162
Clearly.

01:10:55.934 --> 01:10:57.866
Your mother died in my arms.

01:10:57.868 --> 01:10:59.869
She left me son.

01:10:59.871 --> 01:11:01.838
Now Danny's gone.

01:11:01.840 --> 01:11:04.339
You have to understand,
I need you to understand

01:11:04.341 --> 01:11:07.677
I'd do anything to keep
you safe and Jessica too.

01:11:07.679 --> 01:11:10.746
You've got a lot of
nerve talking about love.

01:11:10.748 --> 01:11:11.684
And safety?

01:11:12.951 --> 01:11:13.783
So tell me what to do?

01:11:13.785 --> 01:11:16.886
You really are
a sad little man.

01:11:16.888 --> 01:11:17.820
Do you know I'm not surprised

01:11:17.822 --> 01:11:20.923
that you made a mess of things.

01:11:20.925 --> 01:11:24.326
You have no idea what
you're doing do you?

01:11:24.328 --> 01:11:25.561
No, you're right.

01:11:25.563 --> 01:11:26.795
You were supposed to
rise to the occasion

01:11:26.797 --> 01:11:30.932
and be a father because Danny
needed you and I needed you,

01:11:30.934 --> 01:11:34.971
and you're our father
and you neglected us!

01:11:34.973 --> 01:11:37.073
At least you managed
to keep your job, eh?

01:11:37.075 --> 01:11:38.307
It's all I have left of your...

01:11:38.309 --> 01:11:39.008
What about us?

01:11:39.010 --> 01:11:41.009
- Stop it!
- What about us?

01:11:41.011 --> 01:11:42.744
You know what, you make me sick!

01:11:42.746 --> 01:11:44.914
You're so blind you can't
see that we're a part of her,

01:11:44.916 --> 01:11:49.017
and we was right in front of
you the whole fucking time!

01:11:49.019 --> 01:11:52.991
Just get out, go kill
yourself, I don't give a shit!

01:11:54.826 --> 01:11:55.661
Aye.

01:11:56.795 --> 01:12:00.495
If you don't trust Charlie,
go speak to his partner.

01:12:00.497 --> 01:12:03.669
Detective Sergeant
something or other.

01:12:07.604 --> 01:12:09.338
You're gonna let him
walk away like that?

01:12:09.340 --> 01:12:09.974
Fuck!

01:12:12.109 --> 01:12:12.944
Fuck.

01:12:18.015 --> 01:12:19.749
Are you gonna answer that?

01:12:19.751 --> 01:12:20.385
No.

01:12:22.086 --> 01:12:24.052
Well who's calling you then?

01:12:24.054 --> 01:12:25.588
I don't know.

01:12:25.590 --> 01:12:27.026
Who do you think?

01:12:32.496 --> 01:12:33.529
Hello?

01:12:33.531 --> 01:12:35.868
Hi, is Patrick there?

01:12:37.001 --> 01:12:38.037
It's Ed.

01:12:42.407 --> 01:12:43.042
Yeah?

01:12:44.576 --> 01:12:45.810
Patrick.

01:12:46.678 --> 01:12:48.680
It's about your brother.

01:12:50.581 --> 01:12:51.582
He was shot.

01:12:52.884 --> 01:12:54.987
So what are you saying?

01:12:55.953 --> 01:12:58.023
He's dead Patrick.

01:13:02.493 --> 01:13:03.761
Love you too.

01:13:17.642 --> 01:13:19.174
Hello handsome.

01:13:19.176 --> 01:13:21.511
I'm waiting for someone.

01:13:21.513 --> 01:13:23.614
Just trying to be nice.

01:13:29.621 --> 01:13:31.454
Do you have kids?

01:13:31.456 --> 01:13:32.391
One, you?

01:13:34.024 --> 01:13:34.859
Two.

01:13:37.662 --> 01:13:41.897
Nature calls, I'll talk to
you more when I get back.

01:13:41.899 --> 01:13:43.035
Sure you will.

01:13:55.112 --> 01:13:58.047
Do you know who this is?

01:13:58.049 --> 01:13:59.115
No.

01:13:59.117 --> 01:14:00.249
Doesn't matter.

01:14:00.251 --> 01:14:04.520
What matters is you have
the balls to finish the job.

01:14:04.522 --> 01:14:05.987
Da.

01:14:05.989 --> 01:14:07.722
What
are you doing here?

01:14:07.724 --> 01:14:10.026
I wanted
to talk with you.

01:14:10.028 --> 01:14:12.227
I swear to Christ you'll
be the death of me boy.

01:14:12.229 --> 01:14:14.096
What is it?

01:14:14.098 --> 01:14:15.100
It's Luke.

01:14:18.569 --> 01:14:19.404
He's dead.

01:14:22.239 --> 01:14:23.972
What?

01:14:23.974 --> 01:14:25.109
He's dead Dad.

01:14:48.065 --> 01:14:49.067
Shoot him.

01:14:50.233 --> 01:14:54.070
Jesus Christ man, you've
just been telt your son's dead.

01:14:54.072 --> 01:14:56.004
An eye for an eye.

01:14:56.006 --> 01:14:57.175
Now shoot him.

01:14:58.175 --> 01:14:59.210
Shoot him!

01:15:01.712 --> 01:15:02.547
No.

01:15:06.783 --> 01:15:08.150
And where the fuck's he going?

01:15:08.152 --> 01:15:09.221
Your house.

01:15:24.602 --> 01:15:28.773
Now it looks like you shouldn't
have given me this then.

01:15:29.741 --> 01:15:32.642
There's only one bullet in it.

01:15:32.644 --> 01:15:36.712
Use it shoot him, you and
your family walk free.

01:15:36.714 --> 01:15:37.882
You bastard.

01:15:39.250 --> 01:15:42.951
Your twins will be upstairs
with my girls tonight.

01:15:42.953 --> 01:15:44.121
You're sick.

01:15:49.093 --> 01:15:51.160
You an atheist?

01:15:51.162 --> 01:15:53.663
What's that got
to do with anything?

01:15:53.665 --> 01:15:55.164
Everything.

01:15:55.166 --> 01:15:58.133
Because if you believe in
God you won't shoot him.

01:15:58.135 --> 01:16:01.637
For fear of burning
in Hell for eternity.

01:16:01.639 --> 01:16:05.743
But if you don't believe
in God, there's no issue.

01:16:07.111 --> 01:16:09.911
Because your family's in danger,

01:16:09.913 --> 01:16:12.917
and to save them
you will shoot him.

01:16:15.319 --> 01:16:16.153
So,

01:16:17.854 --> 01:16:19.690
do you believe in God?

01:16:53.858 --> 01:16:55.624
You wanna prove yourself to me?

01:16:55.626 --> 01:16:57.261
Bring him to me alive.

01:16:58.962 --> 01:16:59.797
Go!

01:17:20.050 --> 01:17:22.218
Guns away, all right.

01:17:22.220 --> 01:17:25.057
You go that way,
I'll go this way.

01:17:27.157 --> 01:17:28.257
What the fuck's going on?

01:17:28.259 --> 01:17:29.424
They've got guns.

01:17:29.426 --> 01:17:30.860
Why have they got guns?

01:17:30.862 --> 01:17:33.732
You need to sort
it out, seriously.

01:17:35.166 --> 01:17:37.732
You're giving me
a fucking headache.

01:17:37.734 --> 01:17:38.668
Where are you going?

01:17:38.670 --> 01:17:39.935
Home.

01:17:39.937 --> 01:17:43.007
You better fucking
hope they catch him.

01:17:51.114 --> 01:17:51.981
Fuck.

01:17:51.983 --> 01:17:53.348
Fuck, fuck.

01:17:53.350 --> 01:17:54.816
Fuck.

01:18:04.194 --> 01:18:04.996
Shit.

01:18:10.167 --> 01:18:11.066
Amy!

01:18:11.068 --> 01:18:12.000
What?

01:18:12.002 --> 01:18:12.802
I need somewhere to hide.

01:18:12.804 --> 01:18:13.436
What's going on.

01:18:13.438 --> 01:18:15.273
Can I explain later?

01:18:20.144 --> 01:18:21.146
Wait here.

01:18:30.921 --> 01:18:32.021
Where is he?

01:18:32.023 --> 01:18:33.025
Excuse me?

01:18:39.429 --> 01:18:41.332
Give me five minutes.

01:18:44.035 --> 01:18:46.435
What the hell is going on?

01:18:46.437 --> 01:18:47.869
It's complicated.

01:18:47.871 --> 01:18:49.338
Why were those
men following you.

01:18:49.340 --> 01:18:50.405
They still out there?

01:18:50.407 --> 01:18:52.243
No, no they've gone.

01:18:55.446 --> 01:18:56.281
Charlie.

01:18:57.447 --> 01:18:58.282
Who?

01:18:59.317 --> 01:19:00.419
My brother.

01:19:02.286 --> 01:19:05.420
He's involved in
my son's murder.

01:19:05.422 --> 01:19:06.489
Oh I'm calling the police.

01:19:06.491 --> 01:19:07.356
No, no wait!

01:19:07.358 --> 01:19:09.424
He is the police.

01:19:09.426 --> 01:19:10.459
I'm going.

01:19:10.461 --> 01:19:11.293
Wait!

01:19:11.295 --> 01:19:13.361
Where are you going?

01:19:13.363 --> 01:19:15.130
I shouldn't have come here,
I'm putting you in danger.

01:19:15.132 --> 01:19:16.332
Stop.

01:19:16.334 --> 01:19:18.103
Stop, I want to help.

01:19:19.470 --> 01:19:22.107
So, the rumors, they're true?

01:19:24.975 --> 01:19:28.410
I'm trying to get to
the bottom of everything.

01:19:28.412 --> 01:19:30.846
It's even worse than I imagined.

01:19:30.848 --> 01:19:32.417
If that's possible.

01:19:33.384 --> 01:19:36.421
Amy, I don't think
I can fix this.

01:19:39.489 --> 01:19:43.225
Think you're too small
to make a difference?

01:19:43.227 --> 01:19:45.326
Try sleeping with
a mosquito, aye.

01:19:45.328 --> 01:19:46.529
The Dalai Lama.

01:19:46.531 --> 01:19:47.733
Very good.

01:19:52.303 --> 01:19:53.138
Okay.

01:19:56.206 --> 01:19:57.039
There.

01:19:57.041 --> 01:19:57.876
Aye.

01:20:16.126 --> 01:20:17.459
I can't.

01:20:17.461 --> 01:20:18.393
You're the same age as Robert.

01:20:18.395 --> 01:20:19.864
Who's Robert?

01:20:21.299 --> 01:20:22.397
No!

01:20:22.399 --> 01:20:23.234
I can't.

01:20:26.504 --> 01:20:28.469
You know I'm not a parent
so I can't tell you what to do

01:20:28.471 --> 01:20:31.509
but if I were you
I'd stop hiding.

01:20:38.416 --> 01:20:39.918
This isn't safe.

01:20:45.255 --> 01:20:47.356
Robert, we can't...

01:20:47.358 --> 01:20:49.391
I know, just...

01:20:49.393 --> 01:20:51.395
Let me think, all right?

01:20:53.230 --> 01:20:54.896
We have to go to the police.

01:20:54.898 --> 01:20:55.530
Your dad said...

01:20:55.532 --> 01:20:57.232
What if he's wrong?

01:20:57.234 --> 01:20:59.133
Well we don't have
very many options do we?

01:20:59.135 --> 01:21:00.971
We could just leave.

01:21:02.406 --> 01:21:03.507
Go where?

01:21:05.108 --> 01:21:07.075
This is our home.

01:21:07.077 --> 01:21:09.413
Christ, what about your dad?

01:21:13.517 --> 01:21:15.584
Don't get any ideas.

01:21:46.349 --> 01:21:47.184
Fuck!

01:22:00.531 --> 01:22:02.466
I better take this.

01:22:05.469 --> 01:22:07.369
William where are you?

01:22:07.371 --> 01:22:09.304
Not falling
for that one again.

01:22:09.306 --> 01:22:11.507
Listen to me, you're in
this deep now killing his son.

01:22:11.509 --> 01:22:14.276
Yes man, you lost
yours but Jesus Christ.

01:22:14.278 --> 01:22:15.610
You've gone and got
yourself fucking killed,

01:22:15.612 --> 01:22:17.279
that's what you've done.

01:22:17.281 --> 01:22:19.213
Why'd you do it Charlie?

01:22:19.215 --> 01:22:20.615
He had a child on the way

01:22:20.617 --> 01:22:22.517
and you weren't
around to help him.

01:22:22.519 --> 01:22:25.286
I saw an opportunity for
him to make a bit of cash,

01:22:25.288 --> 01:22:27.588
I never knew it was
gonna go down like this.

01:22:27.590 --> 01:22:30.592
If I did I would never
have let it happen.

01:22:30.594 --> 01:22:32.561
What did you expect
was gonna happen?

01:22:32.563 --> 01:22:35.196
You're police for fuck's sake!

01:22:35.198 --> 01:22:37.298
You've got to believe me
William, you're my brother.

01:22:37.300 --> 01:22:39.133
I would never put
you through this.

01:22:39.135 --> 01:22:42.503
Spare me your bullshit compassion,
it's not real Charlie.

01:22:42.505 --> 01:22:45.209
You should've just come clean!

01:22:46.344 --> 01:22:47.679
I was ashamed.

01:22:48.712 --> 01:22:50.545
I couldn't do
anything to help her.

01:22:50.547 --> 01:22:52.513
You could've done your job.

01:22:52.515 --> 01:22:54.549
What if I'd done the same
to your little girls?

01:22:54.551 --> 01:22:57.986
Think about that for one second.

01:22:57.988 --> 01:23:00.054
You know what Charlie, I
only called to let you know

01:23:00.056 --> 01:23:01.623
I'm not going to the police.

01:23:01.625 --> 01:23:04.429
What you do now is down to you.

01:23:06.529 --> 01:23:08.032
Oh Jesus Christ.

01:23:21.612 --> 01:23:23.012
Who's this?

01:23:23.014 --> 01:23:26.280
Who do you think
you fucking cockroach?

01:23:26.282 --> 01:23:29.250
Just when I was
starting to dislike you.

01:23:29.252 --> 01:23:31.486
Shut the fuck up and listen.

01:23:31.488 --> 01:23:33.355
I'm coming to you.

01:23:33.357 --> 01:23:35.624
Why would you do that?

01:23:35.626 --> 01:23:38.793
'Cause
I'm tired of running.

01:23:38.795 --> 01:23:40.262
You know where to find us.

01:23:40.264 --> 01:23:41.199
Aye I do.

01:23:44.167 --> 01:23:46.071
Right you, back home.

01:23:47.438 --> 01:23:48.736
Really?

01:23:48.738 --> 01:23:50.239
Don't make me tell you again.

01:23:50.241 --> 01:23:51.073
I can help.

01:23:51.075 --> 01:23:51.710
Boy!

01:23:54.644 --> 01:23:57.581
I should've sent
you to Scotland.

01:23:59.215 --> 01:24:02.219
You wish I'd died
instead of Luke?

01:24:03.621 --> 01:24:04.456
Yes.

01:24:12.696 --> 01:24:14.730
He's coming to us.

01:24:14.732 --> 01:24:16.198
Get ready.

01:24:20.638 --> 01:24:21.669
Hey.

01:24:21.671 --> 01:24:23.704
Where are you going?

01:24:23.706 --> 01:24:24.642
Got drinks.

01:24:27.310 --> 01:24:28.776
Leave them.

01:24:28.778 --> 01:24:29.613
What?

01:24:37.520 --> 01:24:38.686
Andy I've told you
there are no promotions

01:24:38.688 --> 01:24:40.155
to give at the moment.

01:24:40.157 --> 01:24:41.390
Yeah I know but I
thought that maybe,

01:24:41.392 --> 01:24:42.156
you know I just
saying we could...

01:24:42.158 --> 01:24:43.325
Uh, sorry.

01:24:43.327 --> 01:24:46.431
Ma'am there's someone
here to see you.

01:24:48.666 --> 01:24:50.632
I just know that he was there,

01:24:50.634 --> 01:24:51.732
and he left in
quite a hurry so...

01:24:51.734 --> 01:24:54.038
She's here for you now.

01:25:08.685 --> 01:25:10.686
You actually came.

01:25:10.688 --> 01:25:12.824
I'm not afraid of ya.

01:25:14.157 --> 01:25:15.656
You're brave.

01:25:15.658 --> 01:25:17.892
Give yourself up like this.

01:25:17.894 --> 01:25:21.262
Especially after killing my son.

01:25:21.264 --> 01:25:22.763
You're going to be
in a world of pain

01:25:22.765 --> 01:25:24.701
over the next few days.

01:25:27.170 --> 01:25:28.839
So, now you're here.

01:25:30.306 --> 01:25:31.142
Now what?

01:25:32.609 --> 01:25:34.642
What's your proposition?

01:25:34.644 --> 01:25:36.777
Simple, you versus me.

01:25:36.779 --> 01:25:37.779
One on one.

01:25:37.781 --> 01:25:41.653
You're gonna suffer for
what you did to my son.

01:25:45.723 --> 01:25:49.693
What's stopping me shooting
you in the head right now?

01:25:50.861 --> 01:25:53.262
I thought
you were a fighter?

01:25:53.264 --> 01:25:55.100
Obviously I was wrong.

01:26:01.272 --> 01:26:03.841
Are you sure
you wanna do this?

01:26:05.442 --> 01:26:08.246
Never been more
sure in my life.

01:26:46.817 --> 01:26:48.749
My pathetic stepson.

01:26:48.751 --> 01:26:51.753
He should've sorted this
mess out from the beginning.

01:26:51.755 --> 01:26:54.255
He let her go,
because he doesn't have

01:26:54.257 --> 01:26:56.490
the vicious gene that you do

01:26:56.492 --> 01:26:59.962
that's happy to kill
a pregnant girl.

01:26:59.964 --> 01:27:02.731
He gets that from his mother.

01:27:02.733 --> 01:27:03.765
Shaw.

01:27:03.767 --> 01:27:05.702
Police are on their way.

01:27:13.510 --> 01:27:15.944
♪ Oh Danny Boy

01:27:15.946 --> 01:27:20.781
♪ The pipes, the
pipes are calling

01:27:20.783 --> 01:27:22.250
You're stronger.

01:27:22.252 --> 01:27:23.718
I'll give you that.

01:27:23.720 --> 01:27:27.892
Your son was begging for
his life when we killed him.

01:27:28.826 --> 01:27:31.496
Finish him off for me would you?

01:27:41.871 --> 01:27:42.971
Don't fucking move!

01:27:42.973 --> 01:27:43.808
Or you.

01:28:04.461 --> 01:28:05.230
Coward!

01:28:08.299 --> 01:28:08.933
It's over.

01:28:12.736 --> 01:28:13.738
Not quite.

01:28:20.376 --> 01:28:23.614
We still have some
unfinished business.

01:28:27.718 --> 01:28:29.985
I'll try not to
enjoy this too much.

01:28:41.931 --> 01:28:43.498
And that one's Charlie?

01:28:43.500 --> 01:28:45.502
Yeah that's him.

01:29:01.751 --> 01:29:03.084
Patrick Shaw,
I'm arresting you

01:29:03.086 --> 01:29:05.387
for the murder of Danny McCrae.

01:29:05.389 --> 01:29:06.588
You don't have to say anything,

01:29:06.590 --> 01:29:08.993
but it may harm your defense.

01:29:16.934 --> 01:29:17.966
Bastard!

01:29:17.968 --> 01:29:18.803
Come on!

01:29:21.971 --> 01:29:22.971
What's going on?

01:29:22.973 --> 01:29:23.905
The door's locked ma'am.

01:29:23.907 --> 01:29:24.806
Then get the bloody ram.

01:29:24.808 --> 01:29:25.943
- Yes ma'am.
- Now!

01:29:28.812 --> 01:29:29.647
Come on!

01:30:43.821 --> 01:30:45.122
Get a paramedic.

01:30:46.756 --> 01:30:48.990
Looks like your sons
given up on you.

01:30:48.992 --> 01:30:52.793
I hope you like four
concrete walls and a bed.

01:30:52.795 --> 01:30:55.163
We have to take you
sir, we're the police.

01:30:55.165 --> 01:30:57.466
- Come with us.
- Yes.

01:30:57.468 --> 01:30:58.098
Come this way.

01:30:59.603 --> 01:31:02.440
My da,
my da is in there.

01:31:03.239 --> 01:31:04.705
Robert, he's there!

01:31:04.707 --> 01:31:05.710
Robert, come!

01:31:07.711 --> 01:31:09.947
Paramedic here.

01:31:12.849 --> 01:31:14.518
Look at your face.

01:31:17.187 --> 01:31:18.119
Sorry.

01:31:18.121 --> 01:31:19.154
It's all right.

01:31:19.156 --> 01:31:21.056
It's okay, it's all right.

01:31:21.058 --> 01:31:22.059
You're okay.

01:31:23.026 --> 01:31:24.761
It's okay, it's okay.

01:31:26.630 --> 01:31:27.465
It's okay.

01:31:29.265 --> 01:31:30.765
It's all right.

01:31:53.223 --> 01:31:54.856
Hey.

01:31:54.858 --> 01:31:55.693
Oh, hi.

01:31:59.229 --> 01:32:00.064
Sorry.

01:32:01.163 --> 01:32:02.129
About the other week.

01:32:02.131 --> 01:32:03.932
Oh, it's all right.

01:32:03.934 --> 01:32:05.799
Wasn't your fault.

01:32:05.801 --> 01:32:07.668
I was worried about you.

01:32:07.670 --> 01:32:10.704
Well I'm okay, but thank you.

01:32:10.706 --> 01:32:12.209
So, you're back?

01:32:15.211 --> 01:32:16.246
No.

01:32:17.113 --> 01:32:18.549
I quit, just now.

01:32:20.983 --> 01:32:21.818
Why?

01:32:23.252 --> 01:32:26.186
A friend did ask me one
time why I chose literature,

01:32:26.188 --> 01:32:30.160
but truth is I never did,
it was my wife's passion.

01:32:31.327 --> 01:32:33.994
I've been living it
for her all this time.

01:32:33.996 --> 01:32:35.765
So, got to let it go.

01:32:37.701 --> 01:32:41.069
So what are you gonna do now?

01:32:41.071 --> 01:32:42.570
Do what I should've
done years ago.

01:32:42.572 --> 01:32:44.075
Be with my family.

01:32:48.278 --> 01:32:49.843
It was good knowing you Amy.

01:32:51.681 --> 01:32:54.048
Likewise William.

01:32:54.050 --> 01:32:54.883
Be good.

01:33:48.000 --> 01:33:53.000
