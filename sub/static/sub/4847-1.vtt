WEBVTT

00:18.390 --> 00:20.730
Moving onto the Hollywood Freeway,
we have a multiple vehicle...

00:20.980 --> 00:22.355
multiple injury accident.

00:22.605 --> 00:25.315
An absolute mess
from VineStreet to the valley.

00:25.565 --> 00:27.655
If you're in it,
expect a long commute.

00:27.900 --> 00:30.070
If you're not,
seek alternate routes.

00:30.320 --> 00:32.365
If Dan doesn 't want to do a daily rate,
we can talk about a weekly rate.

00:32.615 --> 00:35.575
But I'm tellin' you right now,
I'm not goin' below a million.

00:35.825 --> 00:37.700
I mean, think about it.
I'm risking my reputation...

00:37.955 --> 00:39.830
as the host
of this country's number-one...

00:40.080 --> 00:43.835
nationally syndicated talk show to do
a cameo in some cheap slasher flick.

00:44.085 --> 00:46.130
I mean, why can't these guys write me
a fuckin' decent part?

00:46.380 --> 00:48.715
You know?
I lived through the fuckin' thing.

00:48.965 --> 00:51.885
By the way, did you talk to Cathy
about that Navy SEAL script?

00:52.135 --> 00:55.640
Hang on a sec.

00:55.972 --> 00:57.431
- Hello?
- Hello?

00:57.682 --> 00:59.851
- Who's this?
- Who's this?

01:00.101 --> 01:02.103
- Who are you calling?
- Oh. You know what?

01:02.353 --> 01:04.480
- I'm sorry. I have the wrong number.
- That's okay.

01:04.730 --> 01:07.316
Wait a minute. I know your voice.

01:07.567 --> 01:12.280
You sound a lot like that guy on TV.
Um, Cotton Weary.

01:12.530 --> 01:14.240
- I do, huh?
- Yeah.

01:14.490 --> 01:17.660
I think he's got
a really sexy voice.

01:17.910 --> 01:19.829
- Well, thank you.
- Wait a minute.

01:20.079 --> 01:22.623
You are Cotton, aren't you?
Oh, my God.

01:22.874 --> 01:27.378
I am talking to Cotton Weary.
I can't believe this.

01:27.628 --> 01:29.797
You got me. Look, I've--
I've got someone on the other line.

01:30.047 --> 01:32.049
Can you hold on one second?
I'll be right back, I promise.

01:32.300 --> 01:35.303
- Yeah.
- Okay.
- Yeah.

01:35.803 --> 01:40.516
Andrea, uh, I gotta call you back.
Someone's on the other line.

01:41.934 --> 01:46.063
So, uh, you a big 100% Cotton fan?

01:46.314 --> 01:50.776
- Yeah! One hundred and ten percent.
- That's very good.

01:51.027 --> 01:54.697
So, um, why don't you tell me
who you are?

01:54.947 --> 01:58.826
Ooh! You're a naughty boy, Cotton.
Now, what would your girlfriend say?

01:59.076 --> 02:01.287
What makes you think
I have a girlfriend?

02:01.537 --> 02:03.164
I know you do.

02:03.414 --> 02:07.251
- I'm right outside her bathroom door.
- Who is this?

02:07.502 --> 02:12.381
She's in the shower.
She's got a nice little voice.

02:12.632 --> 02:15.510
Let's come in for a closer look.

02:15.760 --> 02:17.970
She's very pretty, Cotton.

02:18.221 --> 02:21.098
A step up from
Maureen Prescott.

02:21.349 --> 02:24.519
Speaking of which,
let's play a little game.

02:24.769 --> 02:26.979
Answer right,
your girlfriend lives.

02:27.230 --> 02:29.148
Answer wrong, she dies.

02:29.398 --> 02:32.193
- Where's Maureen's daughter, Sidney?
- Who the fuck is this?

02:32.443 --> 02:34.946
Somebody who'd kill to know
where Sidney Prescott is!

02:35.196 --> 02:38.741
One chance, Cotton!
You've got connections. Where is she?

02:38.991 --> 02:41.035
You listen to me, you fuckin' psycho.
You lay a finger on Christine...

02:41.285 --> 02:44.705
- and I swear to God I'll kill you.
- Wrong answer!

02:44.956 --> 02:50.336
No! Wait!
Hello? Shit!

02:50.920 --> 02:52.463
- Hey!
- Get outta the way!

02:52.713 --> 02:56.551
- You just hit me!
- Move!

03:20.783 --> 03:22.994
Christine, if you're there,
pick up the phone!

03:23.244 --> 03:28.291
Christine, pick up the phone!
Oh, shit!

03:55.902 --> 03:58.029
You have reached 911.
Due to the volume of calls--

03:58.279 --> 04:02.491
Someone pick up the goddam phone!
Move outta the way!

04:04.410 --> 04:08.497
Shit! Shit!

04:25.348 --> 04:28.851
Cotton, is that you?

04:29.560 --> 04:33.064
Cotton?

04:38.402 --> 04:41.906
Honey?

04:54.752 --> 04:58.256
Okay, Cotton.

04:59.257 --> 05:03.010
You know I don't like
your Stab games.

05:08.182 --> 05:11.018
- Who is it? Who's there?
- Christine?

05:11.269 --> 05:12.770
Hon, you all right?

05:13.020 --> 05:17.191
- I'm home.
-Jesus! You scared the shit outta me.

05:17.441 --> 05:22.488
- You're not gonna believe
what just happened to me.
- What are you talking about?

05:38.379 --> 05:41.132
- Get the hell out of here!
- Okay. Okay, I'm sorry, babe.

05:41.382 --> 05:45.052
I didn't mean to scare you that bad.
It's me. Come on, open the door.

05:45.303 --> 05:48.848
- What are you doing?
- What?
- What the fuck are you doing?

05:49.098 --> 05:52.476
I was-- I was just, you know, trying
to take the game to the next level.

05:52.727 --> 05:54.896
- I'm sorry. Come on,
open the door, Chris.
- The game?

05:55.146 --> 05:57.565
- Yeah, the game!
- What are you talking about?

05:57.815 --> 06:00.693
I'm talking about how much fun it's
gonna be to rip your insides out!

06:00.943 --> 06:03.779
Now, open the fuckin' door, Christine!

06:04.030 --> 06:09.076
- Oh, my God!
- Now you're fuckin' history, baby!

06:25.468 --> 06:28.971
Christine?

06:30.431 --> 06:33.935
Hon?

06:34.936 --> 06:37.939
The recent epidemic of roadrage
in Los Angeles.

06:38.189 --> 06:41.275
- Innocent commuters mercilessly
terrorized, even killed...
- Chris?

06:41.526 --> 06:45.488
- by these madmen of the freeway.
- Don't mess around, okay?

06:45.738 --> 06:48.574
We're gonna make them confront their
victims face-to-face, mano a mano...

06:48.824 --> 06:52.411
right here on 100% Cotton.

06:52.662 --> 06:56.707
There is carnage on our streets.
And remember, it could happen to you.

06:56.958 --> 07:00.211
Tomorrow on 100% Cotton!
Roadrage.

07:00.461 --> 07:02.296
L.A. drivers fight back.

07:02.547 --> 07:06.509
The news is next on channel six with our
exclusive entertainment report live...

07:06.759 --> 07:08.845
from tonight's celebrity
premiere in Hollywood...

07:09.095 --> 07:12.598
followed by--

07:36.706 --> 07:40.209
Oh, shit.

07:53.181 --> 07:56.058
Chris?

07:56.309 --> 07:59.103
Is that you, babe?

07:59.353 --> 08:02.398
Chris, if you're in there,
open the door. Okay, honey?

08:02.648 --> 08:07.278
Chris? Come on, baby.
Open the door.

08:11.324 --> 08:15.620
Chris! Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Jesus!

08:15.870 --> 08:18.039
- It's me, Chris. What are you doin'?
- Stay back.

08:18.289 --> 08:20.833
Stay back.

08:21.083 --> 08:25.213
- Chris, what's goin' on, babe?
- You've gone crazy. That's what!

08:25.463 --> 08:27.507
- Chris, was somebody in the house?
- No! Get back!

08:27.757 --> 08:29.509
Okay, okay, okay.
Just calm down, okay?

08:29.759 --> 08:32.220
- Why do you want to kill me?
- What are you talking about?

08:32.470 --> 08:35.640
- Why do you wanna kill me?
- Gimme the club. All right, honey?
Gimme the club.

08:35.890 --> 08:39.018
Gimme the club, please.

08:39.268 --> 08:42.730
Christine, get outta the way!

08:42.980 --> 08:46.984
Behind you!

08:56.494 --> 08:59.997
Shit!

09:13.970 --> 09:17.974
It was a simple game, Cotton.
You should've told me where Sidney was.

09:18.224 --> 09:22.061
Now, you lose.

09:40.246 --> 09:43.749
Come on.

09:58.181 --> 10:02.476
Come on, Cherokee.
Come on.

10:11.110 --> 10:14.614
Come on.

10:23.080 --> 10:26.584
Come on, Cherokee.

10:44.310 --> 10:46.020
California Women's Crisis Counseling.

10:46.270 --> 10:49.190
Hey, it's Laura from Monterrey reporting
to work. Can you patch me in?

10:49.440 --> 10:52.318
- Sure. Thanks, Laura.
- Thank you.

10:52.568 --> 10:55.696
California Women's Crisis Counseling.
How can I help you?

10:55.947 --> 10:59.700
Hi. Um, do I have to say my name?

10:59.951 --> 11:02.245
No, you don't have to say anything
you don't want to say.

11:02.495 --> 11:04.497
- How can I help?
- Um--

11:04.747 --> 11:08.709
I'm 18 years old,
and I have a boyfriend.

11:08.960 --> 11:11.170
- Sometimes he hits me.
- It's okay.

11:11.420 --> 11:14.423
- You can talk to me, all right?
- Thanks.

11:14.674 --> 11:17.385
So, in closing, as
the future journalists of America...

11:17.635 --> 11:19.470
there is one thing
that you need to remember.

11:19.720 --> 11:23.057
Being the best means being willing
to do what the others would not.

11:23.307 --> 11:25.977
Break the rules.
Stop at nothing.

11:26.227 --> 11:28.980
Be willing to have the world hate you,
because that is the only way...

11:29.230 --> 11:32.775
that you'll get the story,
the facts and the fame.

11:33.025 --> 11:34.777
Thank you.

11:35.027 --> 11:39.282
- Excuse me. Excuse me.
- Yes?

11:39.532 --> 11:41.576
So you're saying that we should
be ready to go out...

11:41.826 --> 11:45.830
and cut each other's throats
because that's what you did.

11:46.080 --> 11:48.791
- Metaphorically, yes.
- Well, tell me, Miss Weathers.

11:49.041 --> 11:53.254
- Was it worth it?
- I'm so sorry. We're out of time.

11:53.504 --> 11:55.548
Gale Weathers, anchor woman for
Total Entertainment.

11:55.798 --> 11:59.302
Thank you very much!

12:04.515 --> 12:06.851
There is a young man outside
who wants to see you.

12:07.101 --> 12:12.565
- He says he's with the police.
- The police?

12:13.691 --> 12:15.401
- Detective Mark Kincaid, L.A.P.D.
- Hello.

12:15.651 --> 12:17.486
- That's quite an impressive resume.
- Thank you.

12:17.737 --> 12:19.572
I assume you're not here
for an autograph.

12:19.822 --> 12:23.326
I'm here because
Cotton Weary's been murdered.

12:24.619 --> 12:26.245
- Someone killed Cotton?
- And his girlfriend.

12:26.495 --> 12:28.789
Someone who left something
he wanted us to see.

12:29.040 --> 12:31.584
I'll show you this because
you're the Woodsboro authority
and because you knew him.

12:31.834 --> 12:35.171
But I promise you,
if you share this with the world,
it's you I'll be arresting.

12:35.421 --> 12:39.175
I swear on my Pulitzer Prize, which
I plan to win one day, Detective.

12:39.425 --> 12:42.720
This was left on Cotton Weary's body.
You have any idea who the girl might be?

12:42.970 --> 12:45.598
Oh, my God.

12:45.848 --> 12:50.394
This is Maureen Prescott.
This is Sidney Prescott's mother.

12:50.645 --> 12:52.438
Hollywood is reeling today
from news...

12:52.688 --> 12:55.942
of the murder of controversial
talkshow host Cotton Weary.

12:56.192 --> 12:58.653
Weary had only recently finished
shooting a cameo as himself...

12:58.903 --> 13:00.947
in the film
Stab 3, Return to Woodsboro...

13:01.197 --> 13:03.032
the third and final part
of the famous horror series...

13:03.282 --> 13:06.285
based on the Woodsboro
and Windsor College murders.

13:06.536 --> 13:09.247
Before his rise to television fame,
Cotton had been imprisoned...

13:09.497 --> 13:15.753
and was later exonerated for the murder
of Maureen Prescott, his former lover--

13:24.846 --> 13:27.849
Just yesterday, Cotton Weary was
shooting here at Sunrise Studios...

13:28.099 --> 13:31.394
his first cameo
in a feature film, Stab 3.

13:31.644 --> 13:35.314
Security here is tight, but we'll see
if we can get a statement. Excuse me.

13:35.565 --> 13:37.400
Always a controversial man--

13:37.650 --> 13:40.319
Channel Eight news.
We gotta get in. We gotta get in.

13:40.570 --> 13:42.029
No press beyond this point.

13:42.280 --> 13:46.033
Alone at night
he crosses flames

13:46.284 --> 13:52.206
Ashe makes a fist
with his red right hand

13:54.125 --> 13:56.586
Look, you're worried about the movie,
then protect the movie, okay?

13:56.836 --> 13:59.672
Hire more security. Hire the National
Guard.Just don't kill the movie.

13:59.922 --> 14:02.842
Violence in cinema
is a big deal right now, Roman.

14:03.092 --> 14:06.220
This is not the kind of news
this studio is after.

14:06.470 --> 14:08.347
So if we stop making
scary movies, what?

14:08.598 --> 14:10.433
All the psychos in the world
will retire? Come on.

14:10.683 --> 14:13.060
I've been makin' horror movies for
30 years, never had a psycho problem.

14:13.311 --> 14:15.146
He was your goddamn idea, guys.
All right?

14:15.396 --> 14:19.317
An ex-con with a trashy talk show?
He must've pissed people off every day.

14:19.567 --> 14:21.986
Detectives, there's no reason
to presume that Cotton's death...

14:22.236 --> 14:24.155
had anything to do
with this movie, is there?

14:24.405 --> 14:30.578
He was making a movie called Stab.
He was stabbed.

14:31.370 --> 14:35.041
Probably some psycho fan pissed off
they killed Randy in Stab 2.

14:35.291 --> 14:37.126
Well, Tyson, that'd make you next,
wouldn't it?

14:37.376 --> 14:40.171
I am not a Randy substitute.
I'm my own character.

14:40.421 --> 14:43.007
Named Ricky,
who works at the video store.

14:43.257 --> 14:44.967
It's an homage.

14:45.218 --> 14:48.304
Hey! What if the killer's
Sidney Prescott?

14:48.554 --> 14:50.598
I mean, what the hell ever happened to
her? She's probably off in the woods...

14:50.848 --> 14:53.184
livin' like
the fuckin' Unabomber, man.

14:53.434 --> 14:56.395
I'm starting to see why
Tori Spelling and David Schwimmer
didn't want to come back.

14:56.646 --> 15:01.150
Guys, this was about Cotton.
We are not in any danger.

15:01.400 --> 15:05.613
"We are not in any danger,"
says Candy, page 15.

15:05.863 --> 15:07.698
I don't see you leavin'.

15:07.949 --> 15:10.993
You think serious black actors
my age can just throw away jobs?

15:11.244 --> 15:15.081
It's all a business now. They got
Usher doing Pinter off-Broadway.

15:15.331 --> 15:17.375
L.L. Cool J's
Shakespearin' in the park.

15:17.625 --> 15:20.002
- Yeah!
- Maybe it's not meant to be.

15:20.253 --> 15:23.673
Not meant to be? You win that
talent search for the new Sidney.

15:23.923 --> 15:28.261
50,000 girls and they pick you. You
gotta be praying this movie keeps going.

15:28.511 --> 15:31.138
Of course I am, but not
at the expense of people's lives.

15:31.389 --> 15:36.352
Oh. Cue the violins, right?

15:46.779 --> 15:49.740
Jesus.

15:52.535 --> 15:55.788
Deja voodoo.

15:57.039 --> 16:00.918
We need this area cleared, please.
Clear it.

16:01.169 --> 16:03.713
- Gale Weathers! Oh, my God!
- Shit.

16:03.963 --> 16:06.841
I-- Listen,
I-I-- I know we've never met...

16:07.091 --> 16:09.427
and I don't mind you never returning
my calls, but I have to tell you...

16:09.677 --> 16:13.181
after two films,
I feel like I am in your mind.

16:13.431 --> 16:17.518
Well, that would explain
my constant headaches.

16:18.227 --> 16:20.605
You know, I'm sorry things didn't
work out on 60 Minutes II.

16:20.855 --> 16:23.441
- But Total Entertainment,
that's a pretty good fallback.
- Thank you.

16:23.691 --> 16:25.902
I'm sorry that things didn't
work out with Brad Pitt...

16:26.152 --> 16:28.112
but being single,
that's a pretty good fallback.

16:28.362 --> 16:30.198
Gives me more time
for my work.

16:30.448 --> 16:32.992
After all, Gale Weathers,
you're such a complex character.

16:33.242 --> 16:37.496
Oh, and to be played by an actress
with such depth and range.

16:37.747 --> 16:41.501
Uh,Jennifer,
Nick said you wanted to--

16:41.542 --> 16:43.127
Gale.

16:43.377 --> 16:46.380
Dewey.

16:46.631 --> 16:51.928
Well, surprise, surprise.
Someone dies and Gale comes running.

16:52.178 --> 16:56.390
Gale, I think you'll really appreciate
my character work in this one.

16:56.641 --> 17:00.269
- Someone's helped me
understand the real you.
- Someone?

17:00.520 --> 17:04.690
Your ruthless ambition,
your private self-loathing...

17:04.941 --> 17:07.693
and that lost and lonely
little girl inside.

17:07.944 --> 17:09.779
Lost and lonely what?

17:10.029 --> 17:13.156
You heard me.
Thanks, Dewey, I'll return it.

17:13.406 --> 17:15.742
Lost and lonely what?

17:15.992 --> 17:19.497
- Little girl inside.
- I thought you were
supposed to be in Woodsboro.

17:19.747 --> 17:21.999
Well, I'm surprised
you thought about me at all.

17:22.250 --> 17:26.253
Listen, I gotta get back to work.
I really don't have time for this.

17:26.503 --> 17:28.673
- Wait a minute. You work here?
- Yeah.

17:28.923 --> 17:30.591
The movie needed
a technical advisor.

17:30.842 --> 17:33.386
Someone who went through the real
experience, knew the real people.

17:33.636 --> 17:36.848
- Hey, Dewey.
- Hey, Tom.

17:37.098 --> 17:40.017
Hey! It's the real Gale Weathers.

17:40.268 --> 17:42.353
Real from top to bottom.

17:42.603 --> 17:44.689
Tom Prinze.
Watch your show all the time.

17:44.939 --> 17:49.277
You're so right. Pop culture
is the politics ofthe 21 st century.

17:49.527 --> 17:51.279
- Thank you.
- And that story that you did...

17:51.529 --> 17:53.698
last month on me crashing my car?

17:53.948 --> 17:57.076
-Wow, was that ever powerful journalism.
-Right, uh--

17:57.326 --> 18:00.538
I especially liked the way
you implied that it was caused
by drinking and drugs.

18:00.788 --> 18:03.666
And that the tyre blowout was faked.
That was great.

18:03.916 --> 18:05.877
Tom, sometimes in journalism
you have to--

18:06.127 --> 18:08.546
Are you parked in the lot?
'Cause I should check to make sure...

18:08.796 --> 18:13.509
that nobody's messed
with your brake line.

18:13.801 --> 18:18.306
Who's he supposed to be?

18:19.390 --> 18:23.352
He's playing you? Him?

18:23.603 --> 18:25.646
What?

18:25.897 --> 18:28.065
I did not come here
to fight with you, Dewey.

18:28.316 --> 18:31.277
- Cotton's killer left a picture.
- Of Sid's mom.

18:31.527 --> 18:34.238
- The detectives told me.
- Well, does Sidney know about it?

18:34.488 --> 18:37.116
Listen, Sidney doesn't need
you and your camera in her life.

18:37.366 --> 18:40.786
Do you see a camera?

18:42.205 --> 18:44.290
Right. You bought me
this purse, didn't you?

18:44.540 --> 18:46.375
- Yeah.
- Look, it's-it's a habit.

18:46.626 --> 18:48.419
-I-I walk outta the house, I turn it on.
-What the hell is this?

18:48.669 --> 18:50.254
- It's like perfume.
- Gale Weathers?

18:50.505 --> 18:52.840
- Could I be more popular?
- No press.

18:53.090 --> 18:55.551
Mo press on set.
Get that woman outta here.

18:55.801 --> 18:58.971
- Yes, Mr Milton. Let's go.
- Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
Where is Detective Kincaid?

18:59.222 --> 19:01.057
- I am working with Kincaid, Dewey.
- Come on. Move along, miss. Let's go.

19:01.307 --> 19:08.397
Rules are rules, Gale.
But, really, it was great seeing you.

19:09.023 --> 19:12.276
Stab 3 is a closed set. But just up
ahead is the old Seinfeld stage.

19:12.527 --> 19:14.612
Now, does anybody
need a potty break?

19:14.862 --> 19:17.114
- Oh, I do.
- Yeah, me too.

19:17.365 --> 19:20.993
Okay, let go!
Thanks for your help, boys.

19:21.244 --> 19:25.122
Holy shit, Silent Bob. It's that
TV news chick, Connie-fuckin'-Chung!

19:25.373 --> 19:28.584
Hey, Connie, how's Maury?

19:28.835 --> 19:34.465
Dude, I think she likes me.
See how she's lookin' at me?

19:35.424 --> 19:37.885
It's happening again.

19:38.135 --> 19:40.555
Cotton had a lot
of enemies, Sid.

19:40.805 --> 19:44.559
The police aren't saying
it's related to us.

19:45.309 --> 19:48.813
Do you ever think about her?

19:49.730 --> 19:51.274
Your mom?

19:51.524 --> 19:54.610
None of this would've
ever happened if she hadn't--

19:54.861 --> 19:58.364
if she hadn't--

20:00.783 --> 20:02.994
Why'd she have
so many secrets, Dad?

20:03.244 --> 20:07.331
Listen, maybe it's time
you came home.

20:07.915 --> 20:11.127
I'm worried about you, kid. Out here
by yourself. You never see anyone.

20:11.377 --> 20:15.089
The only people you talk to
don't even know your real name.

20:15.339 --> 20:19.010
It's as if you don't exist.

20:20.553 --> 20:26.642
That's the idea. Psychos
can't kill what they can't find.

21:43.803 --> 21:46.848
Sid, come here.

21:47.098 --> 21:49.725
Mother needs to talk to you.

21:49.976 --> 21:53.521
Everything you touch, Sid, dies!

21:53.771 --> 21:57.483
You're poison.
You're just like me.

21:57.733 --> 22:01.612
You're just like me.

22:01.863 --> 22:07.702
Oh, my God!
What have they done to me?

22:09.078 --> 22:10.580
They'll do it to you.

22:10.830 --> 22:14.667
- They'll do it to you, baby.
- Mom?

23:03.841 --> 23:07.345
Roman?

23:08.471 --> 23:13.518
Stab 3.
Jesus, I gotta get a new agent.

23:14.352 --> 23:17.855
Roman?

23:25.154 --> 23:28.658
Someone here?

23:35.706 --> 23:37.625
Stan, my man.
He does good work, huh?

23:37.875 --> 23:39.710
- Thank you. Thank you very much.
- Fuck you very much.

23:39.961 --> 23:43.840
- Tyson, go to hell.
- Well, excuse us, Sarah. Makeup tests.

23:44.090 --> 23:46.926
Yeah, makeup. You can use it.
Damn it, have you seen Roman?

23:47.176 --> 23:49.554
Look, everyone in the office
has gone home already.

23:49.804 --> 23:54.684
- He said it was important.
- Everything's important to Roman.

24:17.748 --> 24:21.252
Oh, shit!

24:28.509 --> 24:30.803
- Director's office.
- Sarah, it's Roman.

24:31.053 --> 24:33.973
I'm sorry I'm running late. I'm still
on the 405. I'm about ten minutes away.

24:34.223 --> 24:38.686
Oh, it's no problem. I'm just
lookin' at your music video awards.

24:38.936 --> 24:42.315
Since I got you on thephone, let's--
let's talk about your character, okay?

24:42.565 --> 24:45.568
What character? I'm Candy,
the chick who gets killed second.

24:45.818 --> 24:48.988
- I'm only in two scenes.
- You're not happy with your part.

24:49.238 --> 24:53.075
I'm not happy that I am
35 playing a 21-year-old.

24:53.326 --> 24:55.286
I'm not happy
that I have to die naked.

24:55.536 --> 24:58.372
And I'm not happy that my character is
too stupid to have a gun in the house...

24:58.623 --> 25:01.459
after her boyfriend's
been cut into fish sticks.

25:01.709 --> 25:04.962
Great, okay.
So let's--let's run the lines.

25:05.213 --> 25:06.839
Fine.

25:07.089 --> 25:11.594
Page28.
Candy's big moment.

25:13.054 --> 25:15.932
Page 28.

25:16.182 --> 25:18.518
Ring-ring.
Hello?

25:18.768 --> 25:21.229
- Hello?
- Who's this?

25:21.479 --> 25:23.523
- Who's this?
- This is Candy.

25:23.773 --> 25:25.650
Hang on.
Let me get some clothes.

25:25.900 --> 25:28.778
See? I don't understand why I have
to start the scene in the shower.

25:29.028 --> 25:32.490
The whole shower thing's been done.
Vertigo. Hello?

25:32.740 --> 25:37.036
And I mean, my boyfriend just died.
Why am I showering?

25:37.286 --> 25:39.330
Why don't we just read the scene?

25:39.580 --> 25:44.544
Candy. Nice name. Is that like
Candy Cane or Candy Apple?

25:44.794 --> 25:47.088
Whatever.

25:47.338 --> 25:49.465
Come on.
Who is this?

25:49.715 --> 25:51.884
I think you have
the wrong number.

25:52.134 --> 25:55.638
- But you know my favourite name?
- I'm hanging up right now.

25:55.888 --> 25:57.723
It's Sarah.

25:57.974 --> 26:01.227
Roman, that's not the line.

26:01.477 --> 26:03.896
It is in my script.

26:04.146 --> 26:06.941
Has there been another goddam rewrite?
How the fuck...

26:07.191 --> 26:10.069
are we supposed to learn our lines when
there's a new script every 15 minutes?

26:10.319 --> 26:14.156
It's not just a new script.
It's a new movie.

26:14.407 --> 26:17.702
- What? What movie?
- My movie.

26:17.952 --> 26:23.040
And it's called Sarah Gets
Skewered Like a Fuckin' Pig!

26:23.291 --> 26:28.421
Still in character, Sarah?

26:43.436 --> 26:46.939
Shit.

27:09.003 --> 27:11.214
Thank you for calling
Sunrise Picture Studios.

27:11.464 --> 27:15.134
If you'd like today's
commissary menu, press one.

27:17.094 --> 27:20.598
Mr Bridger?

27:33.986 --> 27:36.656
If you'd like to hear previews of
upcoming Sunrise Pictures'releases...

27:36.906 --> 27:38.032
press four.

27:38.282 --> 27:40.243
If you'd like information about
Sunrise Pictures' merchandise...

27:40.493 --> 27:43.454
- Come on. Come on.
- press five.

27:43.704 --> 27:49.460
If you're trying to reach Lot Security
or you have an emergency, press six.

27:57.677 --> 28:00.388
Shit!

28:05.893 --> 28:09.981
Oh! Fuck!

28:25.329 --> 28:27.707
Look, I wanna get something straight.

28:27.957 --> 28:32.587
I only got into this because
the police asked for my help.

28:32.753 --> 28:34.797
- Why would the police come to you?
- Well, I did write..

28:35.047 --> 28:37.049
the definitive book
on the Woodsboro murders.

28:37.300 --> 28:40.094
I'm sure you just can't wait
to write another one.

28:40.344 --> 28:42.889
- What about you?
- What about me?

28:43.139 --> 28:47.685
You said you'd never leave Woodsboro.
"It's the only place that's real."

28:47.935 --> 28:52.023
But now you're here.
Not with me.

28:52.773 --> 28:54.609
Dewey, I took care ofyou.

28:54.859 --> 28:57.445
I waited until you were well,
but I couldn't stay there.

28:57.695 --> 29:00.781
It was like dog years. One year in
Woodsboro is like seven anywhere else.

29:01.032 --> 29:05.828
So it's off to Paris for a week?
New York for a month? L.A. forever?

29:06.078 --> 29:08.706
It was fucking 60 Minutes II.

29:08.956 --> 29:10.791
- I couldn't say no. I could've
been the next Diane Sawyer.
- Wait a minute.

29:11.042 --> 29:16.255
What's wrong with just being
Gale Weathers? I liked her.

29:18.508 --> 29:20.968
It didn't work, Dewey.
We tried. We're different.

29:21.219 --> 29:24.889
You used to say
that was our strength.

29:26.807 --> 29:30.394
- Well--
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

29:30.770 --> 29:34.565
Dewey, you're not just here because
of that second-rate K-Mart...

29:34.815 --> 29:36.651
straight-to-video
version of me, are you?

29:36.901 --> 29:43.324
Brace yourself, Gale.
All of this is actually not about you.

29:43.991 --> 29:48.621
All of what, Dewey?
You do know something, don't you?

29:49.205 --> 29:51.749
- Off the record?
- Always.

29:51.999 --> 29:54.710
Two months ago, the Woodsboro police
got a call from a woman...

29:54.961 --> 29:56.796
who said she was with Stab 3.

29:57.046 --> 29:59.632
She wanted to see the file
on Sid, "for research."

29:59.882 --> 30:01.717
- And?
- The boys said no.

30:01.968 --> 30:03.803
And she wouldn't give her name.

30:04.053 --> 30:06.556
A month later,
the station gets broken into.

30:06.806 --> 30:09.684
- The file room gets ransacked.
- And someone stole Sid's file?

30:09.934 --> 30:13.437
I already removed it.

30:13.688 --> 30:16.899
I think someone on the film
is tryin' to find Sid.

30:17.149 --> 30:21.946
- I'm sorry, this is incredible.
- I said, "off the record."

30:22.530 --> 30:25.575
Right.

30:27.618 --> 30:29.328
It's Jennifer.
She needs me.

30:29.579 --> 30:31.956
-Jennifer?
- Gotta run.

30:32.206 --> 30:36.043
- Wait! Dewey, where are you going?
- I'm on duty.

30:49.348 --> 30:51.392
Stop following me.

30:51.642 --> 30:54.729
I happen to be working
for the police, damn it!

30:54.979 --> 30:58.441
- You're not a detective, Gale.
- Neither are you, Mr Incognito.

30:58.691 --> 31:02.528
- Uh, you left your motor running.
- Damn it.

31:02.778 --> 31:07.116
Fans, I can handle. Fans, they want
a picture, they want a conversation.

31:07.366 --> 31:09.619
I can handle fans!
You see this, Dewey?

31:09.869 --> 31:13.539
I haven't had one ofthese in a year and
a half. Someone's gonna pay for this.

31:13.789 --> 31:17.460
-Jennifer, settle down. What happened?
- I'm with him.
- You.

31:17.710 --> 31:20.087
Like I'm ever going
to win an award playing you.

31:20.338 --> 31:23.341
- There's been a second murder.
- Who?

31:23.591 --> 31:25.426
- Sarah Darling.
- Where?

31:25.676 --> 31:28.012
-At the studio.
-Where? Nancy Drew
wants to know where.

31:28.262 --> 31:31.307
Cotton Weary. Sarah Darling.
Don't you get it?

31:31.557 --> 31:36.187
Someone's killing them in the order
they die in the movie.

31:37.063 --> 31:41.943
- Dewey, who gets killed third?
- Who gets killed third?

31:46.030 --> 31:49.617
You do.

31:58.251 --> 32:01.128
I get killed in Stab 3?
I get killed?

32:01.379 --> 32:03.965
- Yeah.
- Dewey, where are you going?

32:04.215 --> 32:06.592
I have to get something
from my trailer.

32:06.843 --> 32:09.804
Your--
You live here with her?

32:10.054 --> 32:12.765
- Yeah.
- Oh, my God!

32:13.015 --> 32:15.434
I needed a place to stay,
and she said she liked having me around.

32:15.685 --> 32:19.605
- Why?
- She says I make her feel safe.

32:19.856 --> 32:22.733
- She says I'm her rock.
- Her rock?

32:22.984 --> 32:25.653
Yeah. If you weren't so concerned
with pretensions and appearances...

32:25.903 --> 32:28.698
you'd be able to appreciate the
positivity and emotional centeredness...

32:28.948 --> 32:32.785
I provide a woman.

32:34.120 --> 32:36.998
Stone, I'm headed
to the crime scene.

32:37.248 --> 32:42.795
You stay by Jennifer's side.
I suggest a search of the grounds.

32:43.045 --> 32:46.299
Hey, Dewdrop.
Can I have a word?

32:46.549 --> 32:50.511
Just so it can be straight. I'm
the professional celebrity guard here.

32:50.761 --> 32:53.347
My resume lists Julia Roberts,
Salmon Rushdie, Posh Spice.

32:53.598 --> 32:56.392
You are the Hollywood hanger-oner.

32:56.642 --> 32:58.769
'Cause you're just no good
as a cop any more.

32:59.020 --> 33:00.771
Your resume reads
like the obituaries.

33:01.022 --> 33:03.691
So how about you take suggestions
from me? All right?

33:03.941 --> 33:07.445
Whatever you say.

33:07.820 --> 33:10.281
Hmm. Same deal?
Found with the body?

33:10.531 --> 33:13.743
- Yeah, Maureen Prescott again.
- This is great.

33:13.993 --> 33:16.495
Ten more murders
and we can publish a calendar.

33:16.746 --> 33:18.581
The old "killer playing
with the cops" routine.

33:18.831 --> 33:22.502
Very Hannibal Lecter.
Very Seven.

33:22.752 --> 33:25.213
Doesn't the killer come after
the cops in those movies?

33:25.463 --> 33:27.298
Usually one cop makes it.

33:27.548 --> 33:31.677
- And?
- One cop doesn't.

33:31.928 --> 33:33.763
- Usually.
- Detective Kincaid.

33:34.013 --> 33:36.390
- What do we know? Same killer?
- Hey, hey.

33:36.641 --> 33:39.769
Terminal Entertainment,
this is a crime scene, okay?

33:40.019 --> 33:42.063
Wallace, Miss Weathers
is working with me now.

33:42.313 --> 33:44.023
- Thank you, Detective.
- You're welcome.

33:44.273 --> 33:47.860
Well, in that case, I'm gonna go dust
for fingerprints with Jane Pauley.

33:48.110 --> 33:51.948
Uh, photos, Wallace, please?
Thank you.

33:52.198 --> 33:55.034
New pictures, same person.
Anything turn up on your research yet?

33:55.284 --> 33:58.663
- Nothing that will help with these.
- What about an increased
police presence around Jennifer?

33:58.913 --> 34:02.416
- She's the next one
to get killed in the script.
- She has a bodyguard.

34:02.667 --> 34:05.503
And besides, the producers told us
that there were three different
versions of the script.

34:05.753 --> 34:08.255
Something about trying to keep
the ending off the Internet.
You should know that.

34:08.505 --> 34:11.300
You're the technical advisor, right?

34:11.551 --> 34:14.303
Three versions.
Three different characters die next.

34:14.554 --> 34:16.764
And we don't know which one
the killer read.

34:17.014 --> 34:20.434
Hey, hold up.

34:21.060 --> 34:24.438
All I ever wanted to do
was make a real classic lovestory.

34:24.688 --> 34:27.400
And the studio said they'd let me.
I just had to do
a scary movie for them first.

34:27.650 --> 34:29.777
And now we're shut down,
and I am fucked!

34:30.027 --> 34:32.112
God, it's not the end
of the world, Roman.

34:32.362 --> 34:36.324
That is so easy foryou to say. You can
always go back to, to MustSee TV.

34:36.576 --> 34:40.996
You know, I have no movie,
I'm about to turn 30, and it
looks like I'm now the next target.

34:41.246 --> 34:44.750
- What?
- You? Why you?

34:44.876 --> 34:47.003
Do you think this wasn't a message?

34:47.253 --> 34:49.714
- Roman Bridger?
- What?

34:49.964 --> 34:51.841
Mr Bridger,
you didn't tell us...

34:52.091 --> 34:54.302
you spoke with Sarah Darling
before she was murdered.

34:54.552 --> 34:56.179
Uh, spoke with her, uh, when?

34:56.429 --> 34:59.515
The guard said she was here
for a meeting with you.

34:59.765 --> 35:02.101
- What meeting? I don't--
- We talked with her roommate too.

35:02.351 --> 35:05.188
Says you called Sarah,
told her to come down to the studio.

35:05.438 --> 35:07.273
- Roommate answered the phone.
Says it was you.
- Wait a minute. No, no.

35:07.523 --> 35:09.358
I-I never called her.
I never told her to go anywhere.

35:09.609 --> 35:11.485
Roommate says she knows
your voice, Mr Bridger.

35:11.736 --> 35:15.990
Well, she wasn't speaking with me! God!
Look, I did not call Sarah Darling.

35:16.240 --> 35:19.327
- Sarah Darling said you did.
- Someone's trying to ruin my movie.

35:19.577 --> 35:21.245
Someone wants to kill
my movie!

35:21.495 --> 35:23.873
All right, we'll talk about
your movie down at the station.

35:24.123 --> 35:27.043
- All right.
- This is the scene
where you come with us.

35:27.293 --> 35:30.421
Dewey,Jennifer--
Wait a minute.

35:30.671 --> 35:33.508
She wasn't talking with me
on the phone. I'm coming!

35:33.758 --> 35:38.554
I'll call him in. Battery. Mr Riley,
do you have a cell phone I can borrow?

35:38.804 --> 35:42.141
Yeah.

35:42.391 --> 35:45.102
- Thank you.
- God. Roman.

35:45.353 --> 35:47.939
Remind me not
to sleep with him again.

35:48.189 --> 35:51.692
Come here, Cherokee.

35:52.944 --> 35:55.363
California Women's Crisis Counseling.
My name is Laura. How can I help you?

35:55.613 --> 35:59.534
Oh, Laura.
I do have a crisis.

35:59.784 --> 36:02.370
Okay, well, whatever it is,
you can tell me.

36:02.620 --> 36:07.166
Oh, my God.
I've killed someone, Laura.

36:07.291 --> 36:09.252
- Are you sure ?
- Uh-huh, I'm sure.

36:09.502 --> 36:12.547
I killed someone, I know it!
Oh, my God.

36:12.797 --> 36:15.174
- Well, then, um--
- I did.

36:15.424 --> 36:17.218
Then the people you need to call
are the police.

36:17.468 --> 36:21.764
No, I need to call you!
Just you.

36:22.014 --> 36:23.850
I'm sorry, your-your voice--

36:24.100 --> 36:29.480
Don't you wanna know
how you can help, Laura?

36:32.608 --> 36:35.111
Are you listening to me?
Huh?

36:35.361 --> 36:38.573
- Who is this?
- It's Mother, Laura.

36:38.823 --> 36:42.410
Now, be a good girl
and turn on the news.

36:42.660 --> 36:46.247
Do as Mother tells you!

36:46.497 --> 36:49.250
You're not my mother. How did you
get this number? Who is this?

36:49.500 --> 36:52.253
You know your mother's voice
when you hear it!

36:52.503 --> 36:56.799
Now, turn on the news!

36:58.467 --> 37:00.511
And with a second cast member
murdered, Stab 3...

37:00.761 --> 37:03.347
has been officially shut down,
prompting those involved...

37:03.598 --> 37:05.725
to hope and pray that
these killings maybe over.

37:05.975 --> 37:07.685
Just one question.

37:07.935 --> 37:13.065
Do you think it's over, Sidney?
Do you?

37:36.589 --> 37:40.593
The sky was dark this morning

37:41.636 --> 37:45.306
Not a bird in a tree

37:52.355 --> 37:54.232
Is this a wrap party
or is this a wrap party?

37:54.482 --> 37:58.277
Scene 34.
"Maureen's Murder Flashback."

37:58.528 --> 38:02.323
- I never liked that scene.
- That's 'cause you weren't in it.

38:02.573 --> 38:04.450
Scenes 40 through 47.

38:04.700 --> 38:09.413
- "The Prescott House Flashbacks."
- Tom, stop it.

38:09.664 --> 38:11.457
You're scaring me.
Two people are dead.

38:11.707 --> 38:13.835
Scaring you?

38:14.085 --> 38:17.421
Give the sweet,
young ingenue act a rest.

38:17.672 --> 38:22.218
- You're drunk.
- I'm coping.

38:23.386 --> 38:26.764
I bet she fought and clawed
for that Sidney part.

38:27.014 --> 38:29.600
I bet she stepped on any poor girl
that got in her way.

38:29.851 --> 38:34.063
- So you asked her out and she said no?
- That has nothing to do with it.

38:34.313 --> 38:36.607
Right.
Come on, Dewey.

38:36.858 --> 38:39.068
Scene 50.

38:39.318 --> 38:43.406
"Dewey Saves the Day."

39:12.226 --> 39:14.061
She's so focused on success
that she never thinks...

39:14.312 --> 39:16.147
about who she's hurting
to get it.

39:16.397 --> 39:18.357
And you saved her life, like,
how many times?

39:18.608 --> 39:20.443
Gale wants the whole world
to love her.

39:20.693 --> 39:23.362
One person's never enough.
She's a dreamer.

39:23.613 --> 39:26.824
-No, she's a narcissistic, psycho bitch.
-No, she's not.

39:27.074 --> 39:29.118
She's got a good heart.
She does.

39:29.368 --> 39:35.708
She just hides it away because
she thinks people see that as weak.

39:36.375 --> 39:39.420
This is a good picture of you.
You look just like her.

39:39.670 --> 39:41.839
God, Dewey.

39:42.089 --> 39:45.134
You make it sound like
you're still in love with her.

39:45.384 --> 39:47.220
And I left out the part
that she's cruel...

39:47.470 --> 39:53.476
and selfish,
obsessive and annoying.

39:53.893 --> 39:56.729
We have one Gale Weathers here.
We don't need two.

39:56.979 --> 40:01.943
Hey, Dewdrop,
got your girlfriend out here.

40:03.903 --> 40:07.240
Look who I found slinkin'
around the yard. The nightly news.

40:07.490 --> 40:09.408
I wasn't slinking.
I was walking.

40:09.659 --> 40:12.036
You were eaves dropping
at the bedroom window.

40:12.286 --> 40:14.872
Yeah, a bedroom that
you seemed awfully at home in.

40:15.122 --> 40:17.750
All right, let's talk.

40:18.000 --> 40:21.003
Come on.

40:21.254 --> 40:24.006
- What's this about, Gale?
- Did you know they released Roman?

40:24.257 --> 40:26.008
Sarah's call didn't come
from his cell phone.

40:26.259 --> 40:29.929
- Where did it come from then?
- A cloned cell phone. It's untraceable.

40:30.179 --> 40:32.682
Well, thanks for the update, Gale.
Why don't you just go back home?

40:32.932 --> 40:37.144
Dewey, wait a minute.
Just wait one second.

40:37.645 --> 40:39.981
How old do you think
Maureen Prescott is in this picture?

40:40.231 --> 40:42.733
- Nineteen, twenty.
- That's what I thought,
so I checked it out.

40:42.984 --> 40:46.445
I cannot find any information about
her at this age. I mean, nothing.

40:46.696 --> 40:50.283
She lived in Woodsboro her whole life.
Someone there must know something.

40:50.533 --> 40:52.869
Almost her whole life.
Two years before...

40:53.119 --> 40:55.580
she met Sidney's father,
she left Woodsboro.

40:55.830 --> 40:58.249
No one has any idea
where she went or what she did.

40:58.499 --> 41:02.712
I mean, it's-it's like she fell into
a black hole, Dewey! She vanished!

41:02.962 --> 41:04.797
- So?
- So?

41:05.047 --> 41:07.633
Why is the killer
leaving pictures of-of Maureen?

41:07.884 --> 41:12.597
And why these pictures at-at--
at that point in her life?

41:12.763 --> 41:15.892
I don't know! If I thought
like a homicidal maniac...

41:16.142 --> 41:19.896
then I'd know how
a homicidal maniac thinks.

41:24.150 --> 41:25.902
What?

41:26.152 --> 41:30.573
-Jennifer.
-Jennifer?

41:34.118 --> 41:37.079
Look at the buildings.
The second story. There and there.

41:37.330 --> 41:40.249
It's the same!
It's the same street 28 years ago.

41:40.499 --> 41:44.921
Oh, my God. Maureen Prescott was
at the back lot at Sunrise Studios!

41:45.171 --> 41:48.841
- Oh, my God.
- I gotta make some calls.

42:01.687 --> 42:03.523
Steven Stone
Protection Services.

42:03.773 --> 42:05.608
Stone, where are you?

42:05.858 --> 42:08.402
I'm just checking
your tin can, Dewdrop.

42:08.653 --> 42:10.404
Well, come back inside
and stay with Jennifer.

42:10.655 --> 42:12.740
Something's happened.
I have to go to the police.

42:12.990 --> 42:17.161
Is that an order, Dewdrop? 'Cause
Steven Stone doesn't work for you.

42:17.411 --> 42:22.041
Get back in the house, Stone.
Would I call you if it wasn 't important?

42:22.291 --> 42:24.252
- What are you doing in there anyway?
- Me?

42:24.502 --> 42:26.754
I'm just checking to make sure
there's no killer in here...

42:27.004 --> 42:29.674
waitin' to off you
like he did your little sister.

42:29.924 --> 42:32.844
What did you say?
I can't believe you said that.

42:33.094 --> 42:35.304
That makes me...

42:35.555 --> 42:39.225
angry!

42:39.475 --> 42:42.478
Fucker!

42:54.156 --> 42:57.660
Gotta call Kincaid.

43:02.206 --> 43:06.919
Dewey, where is everybody?

43:11.716 --> 43:14.468
- Oh, God.
-Jennifer?

43:14.719 --> 43:18.181
Angelina?
Tom?

43:18.431 --> 43:22.894
Oh, my God!
What happened?

43:24.437 --> 43:28.649
Don't do that.
I'm overreacting.

43:29.108 --> 43:32.695
Dewdrop?

43:36.866 --> 43:41.412
- Stone?
- Oh, my God!

43:42.163 --> 43:43.998
Oh, God, Stone!

43:44.248 --> 43:47.502
Oh, God!

43:50.671 --> 43:56.052
- Dewey, is he dead?
- Yeah.

43:56.636 --> 44:00.389
Everyone back inside!

44:02.642 --> 44:06.229
It's all right.
Don't panic.

44:06.729 --> 44:10.650
Okay, outside. Everyone,
stay together and try to remain calm.

44:10.900 --> 44:12.735
A phone!

44:12.985 --> 44:15.363
- It's not mine.
- It's not mine.

44:15.613 --> 44:19.283
Shit!
It's the fax.

44:26.541 --> 44:28.876
"Interior, Jennifer's house. Living
room, night." It's a script page.

44:29.126 --> 44:33.005
- W-W-What's it say?
- "With the bodyguard stabbed to death,
the five stand trapped.

44:33.256 --> 44:35.466
- He's rewriting the movie.
- As the killer waits outside...

44:35.716 --> 44:37.677
suddenly the fax machine
sends news of their fates."

44:37.927 --> 44:39.804
It's a trick!
Everybody, outside!

44:40.054 --> 44:42.139
- Outside where he can
pick us off one by one?
- Shut up!

44:42.390 --> 44:44.392
"The killer prepares to grant
mercy to only one of them."

44:44.642 --> 44:47.812
Don't you get it? The killer says he's
outside because he wants us here inside.

44:48.062 --> 44:50.189
- Which one is it?
- Come on!

44:50.439 --> 44:52.441
"Who will survive? Is it Jennifer?
Tom? Angelina? Dewey? Gale?

44:52.692 --> 44:56.237
- The killer will give mercy to--"
- Everyone outside!

44:56.487 --> 44:59.657
He grants mercy to who?
I wanna know what happens!

44:59.907 --> 45:02.451
- I wanna know what happens!
- Wait for the fucking movie!

45:02.702 --> 45:04.537
- I've gotta know! I'm goin' back in!
- No.

45:04.787 --> 45:07.248
All right, everyone, back.
Stay together.

45:07.498 --> 45:09.542
- What's it say?
- "And the...

45:09.792 --> 45:11.794
killer will give mercy to...

45:12.044 --> 45:14.547
- whoever--"
- Whoever?

45:14.797 --> 45:17.175
Whoever?

45:17.425 --> 45:19.051
Piece of shit.

45:19.302 --> 45:24.765
"Whoever--
Whoever smells the--"

45:38.863 --> 45:43.117
I can't stop
rolling down the hill!

45:53.711 --> 45:56.422
Gale!Jennifer!

45:56.672 --> 45:58.466
- Dewey!
- Dewey!

45:58.716 --> 46:00.593
Dewey, where are you?

46:00.843 --> 46:04.597
Over here, Dewey!

46:06.390 --> 46:11.103
- Dewey!
- Gale!

46:11.229 --> 46:15.066
Gale, behind you!

46:24.242 --> 46:27.537
Dewey!
Are you all right?

46:27.787 --> 46:30.831
Yeah, never been better.

46:31.082 --> 46:33.501
Yeah, I'm all right.
Where'd he go?

46:33.751 --> 46:38.130
- He must've rolled under the car.
- All right, stay close.

46:45.763 --> 46:48.599
Is he back there?

46:48.850 --> 46:51.477
- No.
- No?

46:51.727 --> 46:56.274
He's fast.
Could've sworn I hit him.

46:59.402 --> 47:02.905
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

47:03.531 --> 47:05.199
Thanks for saving me.

47:05.449 --> 47:08.953
Ah, it's habit.

47:10.663 --> 47:14.166
Oh, God.

47:14.876 --> 47:18.880
What the fuck happened to you?

47:19.130 --> 47:21.465
-Jennifer, wait a minute.
- Who gave you a place to stay?

47:21.716 --> 47:24.969
-Who are you supposed to be protecting?
-Jennifer!

47:25.219 --> 47:29.223
Hey!

47:33.144 --> 47:36.856
My lawyer liked that.

47:37.106 --> 47:40.943
Not as much as I did.

47:45.489 --> 47:48.743
- Angelina?
- Tom was in the house.

47:48.993 --> 47:54.707
- How'd you end up way over there?
- Oh, my God! Tom was in the house!

47:56.626 --> 48:01.339
- Are we safe?
- Safe from who?

48:04.759 --> 48:08.346
Wait a second!

48:11.432 --> 48:15.102
Another picture.

48:18.940 --> 48:22.652
Whoever it is is now taking credit
for Maureen Prescott's murder.

48:22.902 --> 48:25.821
But we know who killed Maureen
Prescott. Billy Loomis and Stu Macher.

48:26.072 --> 48:28.282
-I mean, they even told Sidney
how they did it.
- Yeah, but if I'm not mistaken...

48:28.533 --> 48:30.618
you said in your book that
Sidney got it wrong once before.

48:30.868 --> 48:33.454
She accused Cotton Weary
of murdering her mother.

48:33.704 --> 48:36.541
And he was sent away for it.
Maybe there is a third killer.

48:36.791 --> 48:38.709
Sidney might know something.

48:38.960 --> 48:41.337
I told you.
I don't know where Sidney is.

48:41.587 --> 48:44.006
And even if there was a third killer,
Sidney doesn't know about it.

48:44.257 --> 48:47.385
That is for me to decide.
I need to talk to her, Mr. Riley.
She is a key element in this case.

48:47.635 --> 48:49.720
I have a press conference in an hour.
I need to explain...

48:49.971 --> 48:52.265
why there are three dead celebrities
and a bodyguard.

48:52.515 --> 48:55.101
And a very angry mayor.

48:55.351 --> 48:57.186
Okay, look, we all know this has
something to do with Stab 3.

48:57.436 --> 49:00.273
But what we do not know is why
the killer keeps leaving pictures...

49:00.523 --> 49:02.733
of Maureen Prescott
taken over 25 years ago.

49:02.984 --> 49:05.570
And the photographs taken at the same
studio Stab 3 is shooting out of.

49:05.820 --> 49:07.280
What does this
have to do with Sid?

49:07.530 --> 49:10.074
Who knows more about Maureen
Prescott than her own daughter?

49:10.324 --> 49:13.870
Well, Sid's dad couldn't help you,
and he was married to Maureen.

49:14.120 --> 49:15.872
What's your problem?

49:16.122 --> 49:20.501
Last night you were almost charcoal.
You gonna help us or what?

49:20.751 --> 49:22.712
Do you wanna have this
conversation with a polygraph?

49:22.962 --> 49:28.342
- Is that a threat, Detective?
- When it's a threat, you'll know it.

49:28.593 --> 49:30.720
- Was that a threat?
- Boys, boys.

49:30.970 --> 49:33.264
Why don't we compare
our gun calibres later?

49:33.514 --> 49:36.684
- The issue is Maureen Prescott.
- Wrong. The issue is Sidney Prescott.

49:36.934 --> 49:40.646
And either Mr Riley is going
to obstructjustice or he's going
to put me in touch with her.

49:40.897 --> 49:46.110
So, where is she?

49:48.571 --> 49:51.824
Hi, you've reached the machine.
You can leave a message.
Talk as long as you want.

49:52.074 --> 49:54.702
Sid, it's me.
This is the fifth time I've called.

49:54.952 --> 49:58.873
Please pick up.
I wanna make sure you're...

49:59.123 --> 50:01.501
okay.

50:01.751 --> 50:05.671
- Sid!
- Dewey!

50:06.339 --> 50:08.424
What are you doing down here?

50:08.674 --> 50:11.719
Actually, what was I doing up there?

50:11.969 --> 50:15.056
-Jesus, Dewey. Are you okay?
- Oh, yeah, I'm all right.

50:15.306 --> 50:18.100
- Is she all right?
- Hey, you know Gale.

50:18.351 --> 50:20.937
It'd take a direct hit.

50:21.187 --> 50:25.483
So the news said this was the precinct.
Who's this guy Kincaid?

50:25.608 --> 50:28.569
Come here.
I told you to stay hidden.

50:28.819 --> 50:32.240
- It's not safe for you to be here.
- The killer called me.

50:32.490 --> 50:34.617
- What?
- Yeah, he found me.

50:34.867 --> 50:40.248
I'm no more safe there than I am here,
and at least here I'm not alone.

50:40.623 --> 50:44.377
Okay, come on.

50:44.794 --> 50:46.921
- Detective Kincaid?
- Yeah.

50:47.171 --> 50:49.590
There's someone here
who wants to help.

50:49.841 --> 50:52.343
Oh, my God.
Sidney.

50:52.593 --> 50:54.512
Is the man fast or what?

50:54.762 --> 50:59.100
- Hi.
- Hi, Gale.

50:59.350 --> 51:02.395
- I'm glad you're all right.
- Thank you.

51:02.645 --> 51:07.191
- Sid, this is Detective Kincaid.
- Nice to finally meet you, Sidney.

51:08.776 --> 51:10.611
- The killer called her.
- What? When?

51:10.862 --> 51:13.114
- What did he say?
- Oh, you know, the usual small talk.

51:13.364 --> 51:15.616
What's new? How you been?
How do you wanna die?

51:15.867 --> 51:18.744
Sidney, do you have any idea
how he could've gotten your number?

51:18.995 --> 51:21.956
He could have monitored her calls on a
scanner. Did you call her from the set?

51:22.206 --> 51:25.168
- No.
- Do you have her number
stored in your memory?

51:25.418 --> 51:29.422
- Phone memory!
- Oh. Yeah, guess I do.

51:29.672 --> 51:33.551
- Has anyone else ever used your phone?
-Just Jennifer.

51:33.801 --> 51:35.678
And you.

51:35.928 --> 51:40.641
Hey, I'm the cop here.
You're in my office, Riley.

51:45.563 --> 51:47.982
The killer leaves a photograph
after each murder, Sidney.

51:48.232 --> 51:51.194
They were taken in Hollywood at the same
studio that they're shooting Stab 3.

51:51.444 --> 51:54.280
Why didn't you tell me?
This is my mother, Dewey.

51:54.530 --> 51:57.074
- Why didn't you say something?
- I was afraid they were bait.

51:57.325 --> 51:59.285
Something to, you know,
trick you out of hiding.

51:59.535 --> 52:03.080
Sidney, was she an actress or a model?
Because they look a lot
like publicity stills.

52:03.331 --> 52:06.375
I, uh, don't know.

52:06.626 --> 52:09.504
Detective, I wanna see
this place in the pictures.

52:09.754 --> 52:15.218
- Are you sure?
- Absolutely.

52:16.761 --> 52:19.722
- Slow it down.
- Sorry.

52:19.972 --> 52:23.476
Watch the fuckin' aliens.

52:24.977 --> 52:27.271
I'm gonna go talk to
the studio brass about those photos.

52:27.522 --> 52:29.357
Yeah, right.
I know where you're goin'.

52:29.607 --> 52:31.734
- Yeah, keep an eye on Sidney.
- I know where you're goin'.

52:31.984 --> 52:34.529
You're gonna get her some flowers
and candy, huh? Huh?

52:34.779 --> 52:36.614
- Gimme a break.
- Yeah, gimme a call.

52:36.864 --> 52:40.368
Just keep your eye on her.

52:46.374 --> 52:50.503
That stairwell over there, that's
where one of the pictures was taken.

52:50.753 --> 52:53.339
God. I can't believe
she never mentioned any of this.

52:53.589 --> 52:54.882
- She probably just--
- Dewey!

52:55.132 --> 52:56.676
- Sorry.
- Martha!

52:56.926 --> 52:58.803
- Oh, my God, Sid.
- Hey, hold it right there! Hey!
- Don't shoot!

52:59.053 --> 53:01.180
- I'm only 17.
- It's okay. We know her.

53:01.430 --> 53:03.224
We do?

53:03.474 --> 53:05.476
Tell me that's his ex-girlfriend,
I'll shoot myself.

53:05.726 --> 53:08.229
- It's Martha Meeks, Randy's sister.
- Randy's sister?

53:08.479 --> 53:10.940
- Yeah, can't you tell?
- We miss you in Woodsboro, guys.

53:11.190 --> 53:16.863
- Martha, what are you doing here?
- There's something you guys should see.

53:20.700 --> 53:23.119
Told ya I'd make
a movie someday. Huh?

53:23.369 --> 53:26.581
- Oh, my God.
- Well, if you're watching this tape...

53:26.831 --> 53:28.666
it means, as I feared, I did not
survive these killings...

53:28.916 --> 53:31.502
here at Windsor College,
and that giving up my virginity...

53:31.752 --> 53:34.380
to Karen Kolchakat the video store
was probably not a good idea.

53:34.630 --> 53:36.841
- Karen Kolchak?
- Yes, Karen Kolchak.

53:37.091 --> 53:39.594
- "Creepy Karen"?
- Shut up! She's a sweet person, okay?

53:39.844 --> 53:42.346
We were workin'late. We were puttin'
away some videos in the porno section...

53:42.597 --> 53:45.141
and, you know, shit happens.

53:45.391 --> 53:48.603
- Open the door, Randy!
- Fifteen minutes.

53:48.853 --> 53:51.397
- It's my room too!
- Paul,15 minutes.

53:51.647 --> 53:54.400
I'm leaving my legacy.

53:54.650 --> 53:58.446
Fifteen minutes, Paul!
Damn! Anyway...

53:58.696 --> 54:02.950
the reason I'm here is to help you so
that my death will not be in vain.

54:03.201 --> 54:08.289
That my life's work will help save some
other poor soul from getting mutilated.

54:08.539 --> 54:10.917
If this killer does come back
and he's for real...

54:11.167 --> 54:13.085
there are a few things
that you gotta remember.

54:13.336 --> 54:16.339
Is this simply another sequel?
Well, if it is, same rules apply.

54:16.589 --> 54:18.925
But here's the critical thing.
If you find yourself dealing...

54:19.175 --> 54:21.469
with an unexpected back-story
and ap reponderance...

54:21.719 --> 54:24.305
of exposition,
then the sequel rules do not apply.

54:24.555 --> 54:28.059
Because you're not dealing with
the sequel. You are dealing with...

54:28.309 --> 54:31.354
the concluding chapter
of a trilogy.

54:31.604 --> 54:34.106
- Trilogy.
- That's right. It's
a rarity in the horror field...

54:34.357 --> 54:36.984
but it does exist, and it is
a force to be reckoned with.

54:37.235 --> 54:40.696
Because true trilogies are all about
going back to the beginning...

54:40.947 --> 54:43.074
and discovering something
that wasn 't true from the get-go.

54:43.324 --> 54:45.826
Godfather, Jedi,
all revealed something...

54:46.077 --> 54:48.287
that we thought was true
that wasn 't true.

54:48.538 --> 54:50.748
So if it is a trilogy
you are dealing with...

54:50.998 --> 54:54.168
here are some super
trilogy rules.

54:54.418 --> 54:56.045
One: You've got a killer
who's gonna be superhuman.

54:56.295 --> 54:58.130
Stabbing him won't work.
Shooting him won't work.

54:58.381 --> 55:00.675
Basically, in the third one, you've
gotta cryogenically freeze his head...

55:00.925 --> 55:02.593
decapitate him or blowhim up.

55:02.844 --> 55:05.763
Number two: Anyone, including
the main character, can die.

55:06.013 --> 55:09.183
This means you, Sid.
I'm sorry. It's the final chapter.

55:09.433 --> 55:11.894
It could be fuckin' Reservoir Dogs
by the time this thing is through.

55:12.144 --> 55:14.897
Number three: The past will
come back to bite you in the ass.

55:15.147 --> 55:16.983
Whatever you think you know
about the past, forget it.

55:17.233 --> 55:19.402
The past is not at rest!
Any sins you think...

55:19.652 --> 55:24.949
were committed in the past are about
to break out and destroy you.

55:27.159 --> 55:29.161
So in closing,
let me say...

55:29.412 --> 55:31.914
goodluck, Godspeed...

55:32.164 --> 55:36.169
and for some of you,
I'll see you soon.

55:36.419 --> 55:39.714
'Cause the rules say some of you
ain't gonna make it. I didn't.

55:39.964 --> 55:44.510
Not if you're watching this tape.

55:49.473 --> 55:53.853
Thank you. And you be careful.
Say hi to your folks for me.

55:54.103 --> 55:56.355
You be careful too, Sid.

55:56.606 --> 55:59.150
- Bye, Dewey. Come visit us soon.
- I will, Martha.

55:59.400 --> 56:03.404
- Thank you.
- Bye.

56:05.531 --> 56:07.992
I've got an idea.
I'll hook up with you guys later.

56:08.242 --> 56:10.536
- Do you want us to come with you?
- I work better alone.

56:10.786 --> 56:14.582
Why don't you try to figure out where
those other pictures were taken.

56:14.832 --> 56:19.128
- I can see nothing's changed.
- No.

56:24.050 --> 56:27.553
Oh, shit.

56:27.720 --> 56:31.224
Hello!

56:40.149 --> 56:42.151
-Jeez.
- What the hell are you doing?

56:42.401 --> 56:44.362
Being Gale Weathers.
What the hell are you doing?

56:44.612 --> 56:46.572
- I am Gale Weathers.
- Here's how I see it.

56:46.822 --> 56:49.617
I've got no house, no bodyguard,
no movie, and I'm being stalked.

56:49.867 --> 56:52.036
Because someone wants to kill me?
No, because someone wants to kill you.

56:52.286 --> 56:54.413
So now, starting now,
I go where you go.

56:54.664 --> 56:57.083
That way, if someone wants
to kill me, I'll be with you.

56:57.333 --> 56:59.460
And since they really want to kill you,
they won't kill me, they'll kill you.

56:59.710 --> 57:01.379
- Make sense?
- None.

57:01.629 --> 57:03.506
You know, in the movies,
I play you as being much smarter.

57:03.756 --> 57:07.093
And as a sane person.
Foryou, that must be quite a stretch.

57:07.343 --> 57:09.345
- That's funny.
- Ha!

57:09.595 --> 57:11.430
- Need to get in that building?
- Yeah.

57:11.681 --> 57:13.516
- Is there a story in that building?
- Maybe.

57:13.766 --> 57:17.520
Gale Weathers would find a way.

57:19.021 --> 57:21.816
Bitch. All right, wait.Just--

57:22.066 --> 57:25.319
Don't tell me what to do.

57:31.367 --> 57:33.202
Basements, wow.

57:33.452 --> 57:35.371
Basements creep me out.

57:35.621 --> 57:39.125
You'd make
a fascinating interview.

57:42.044 --> 57:45.548
Hello?

57:52.972 --> 57:55.683
Hi. Excuse me.
I am Gale Weathers...

57:55.933 --> 58:00.104
and I'm here researching
with the police this photo.

58:00.354 --> 58:02.732
It was taken at the studio.
Her name is Maureen Prescott.

58:02.982 --> 58:05.818
Back then it was probably Roberts.

58:06.068 --> 58:08.404
- Hey, are you--
- No.

58:08.654 --> 58:10.781
- But you look just--
- Like her?

58:11.032 --> 58:13.367
- I've been hearing it all my life.
- It's uncanny.

58:13.618 --> 58:16.704
I was up for Princess Leia.
I was this close.

58:16.954 --> 58:19.624
So, who gets it?
The one who sleeps with George Lucas.

58:19.874 --> 58:22.502
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to bring up
a-a sore subject for you.

58:22.752 --> 58:24.837
Sure, you didn't.
None of them did.

58:25.087 --> 58:29.467
So, how can I help you? Or do you want
me to tell you who you look like?

58:29.717 --> 58:32.178
How about some information
on Maureen Roberts?

58:32.428 --> 58:35.014
I don't work for the cops, sweetie.
I work for the studio.

58:35.264 --> 58:40.228
Really? Well,
would you work for...

58:41.103 --> 58:43.231
the president?

58:43.481 --> 58:47.235
The president of the studio.

58:47.485 --> 58:52.865
Fifty dollars? Who are you?
A reporter for Woodsboro High?

58:59.080 --> 59:01.165
It's worth two grand.

59:01.415 --> 59:05.253
Are you gonna help
Gale Weathers or not?

59:06.212 --> 59:08.381
I know every face in here.

59:08.631 --> 59:10.925
I got a respect
for the unknown actor.

59:11.175 --> 59:16.556
If they're looking for Maureen Roberts,
they're never gonna find her.

59:16.597 --> 59:20.017
Rina Reynolds they will.

59:20.268 --> 59:24.021
Rina Reynolds.
Stage name.

59:24.272 --> 59:27.942
You should talk,Judy Jurgenstern.

59:31.487 --> 59:33.656
What are these movies?
Amazombies, Space Psycho...

59:33.906 --> 59:35.741
Creatures from the San Andreas Fault.

59:35.992 --> 59:39.120
Horror pictures
back in Milton's heyday.

59:39.370 --> 59:41.455
- Back in what?
- Back in what?
-John Milton.

59:41.706 --> 59:46.002
The horror producer?
Those were his movies.

01:00:15.740 --> 01:00:19.243
Come on, Sid.

01:00:43.100 --> 01:00:48.064
Oh, my God!
Sidney Prescott!

01:00:48.147 --> 01:00:51.859
Oh, my God! I'm Angelina Tyler.
I'm you! I mean, I'm not.

01:00:52.109 --> 01:00:56.197
I mean, I was.

01:00:59.742 --> 01:01:01.577
I-I thought-- Well,
if there's no movie...

01:01:01.827 --> 01:01:03.788
then no one would care
if I took some souvenirs.

01:01:04.038 --> 01:01:07.041
Souvenirs?

01:01:07.291 --> 01:01:09.752
I may never win another role,
so these may be...

01:01:10.002 --> 01:01:12.797
my only memories,
you know, of Hollywood.

01:01:13.047 --> 01:01:16.467
I-I know it's weird 'cause
it's your life and all, but...

01:01:16.717 --> 01:01:19.804
I wanted to make you proud, Sidney.

01:01:20.054 --> 01:01:24.141
Oh. Well,
I'm sure I would've been.

01:01:24.392 --> 01:01:26.769
The real Sidney.
The real person.

01:01:27.019 --> 01:01:29.814
I wish--

01:01:30.064 --> 01:01:34.068
I wish it would've worked out.

01:01:43.619 --> 01:01:47.123
Hey--

01:01:51.627 --> 01:01:55.131
Angelina?

01:02:07.894 --> 01:02:11.397
Hello?

01:03:29.642 --> 01:03:31.394
Close call.

01:03:31.644 --> 01:03:33.521
What are you doing here?

01:03:33.771 --> 01:03:37.358
It occurred to me that I've never
snuck through your bedroom window.

01:03:37.608 --> 01:03:40.653
See what you do to me?

01:03:40.903 --> 01:03:43.656
What have I done to you?

01:03:43.906 --> 01:03:46.075
About the, uh, sex stuff?

01:03:46.325 --> 01:03:48.828
You know, I'm not trying
to rush you at all.

01:03:49.078 --> 01:03:54.125
Would you settle for
a PG-13 relationship?

01:05:15.206 --> 01:05:18.709
Dewey!

01:06:05.590 --> 01:06:09.343
Dewey!

01:06:12.513 --> 01:06:16.601
Sidney, I'm in here.

01:06:21.939 --> 01:06:24.442
Over here.

01:06:24.692 --> 01:06:29.280
Yes. Mother will protect you
from the bogeyman.

01:06:29.530 --> 01:06:33.576
Come into the bedroom.

01:06:33.826 --> 01:06:37.496
Hide in Mommy's bed.

01:06:39.498 --> 01:06:41.459
I lied, Sidney.

01:06:41.709 --> 01:06:43.252
I can't protect you at all.

01:06:43.503 --> 01:06:47.423
You don't deserve to be protected!
You didn't protect me!

01:06:47.673 --> 01:06:50.134
We did your mom a favour, Sid.
That woman was a slutbag whore...

01:06:50.384 --> 01:06:52.595
who flashed her shit all over town
like she was Sharon Stone.

01:06:52.845 --> 01:06:56.224
'Cause let's face it, Sidney,
your mother was no Sharon Stone.

01:06:56.474 --> 01:06:59.227
- Sidney's mother was fucking my father.
- Sid, where are you?

01:06:59.477 --> 01:07:02.688
Dewey!
Dewey, help me!

01:07:02.939 --> 01:07:06.776
Sidney? Give Mommy a kiss
and we'll make up.

01:07:07.026 --> 01:07:10.029
- No!
- Sidney!

01:07:16.494 --> 01:07:19.038
Sid!

01:07:19.288 --> 01:07:21.290
Sid, are you okay?
What happened?

01:07:21.541 --> 01:07:25.211
The killer's in the house, Dewey.
He's upstairs.

01:07:25.670 --> 01:07:29.966
- And my mother--
- Let's go, let's go.

01:07:30.299 --> 01:07:32.885
I heard her voice.
I saw her, Dewey.

01:07:33.135 --> 01:07:36.055
- Upstairs. Come on, let's go.
- It's okay, Sid.

01:07:36.305 --> 01:07:38.432
You weren't supposed
to go in that house.

01:07:38.683 --> 01:07:40.601
It's all set up for the murder scene.

01:07:40.852 --> 01:07:42.687
- I'm sorry you had to see that.
- He was in there, Dewey.

01:07:42.937 --> 01:07:47.483
- He was in there, I swear, I swear.
- You know I believe you.

01:07:48.901 --> 01:07:51.779
- What happened?
- Kincaid, hey.

01:07:52.029 --> 01:07:55.283
There's nobody up here.

01:07:59.287 --> 01:08:03.040
Come on.

01:08:03.875 --> 01:08:06.502
- Come on.
- Okay, so I stole the mask.

01:08:06.752 --> 01:08:09.964
Whatever. I didn't know you got
the gas chamber for that.

01:08:10.214 --> 01:08:12.800
- You stole the mask?
- I took it.

01:08:13.050 --> 01:08:16.179
- You took the mask
or you stole the mask?
- I-I took it as like a souvenir.

01:08:16.429 --> 01:08:18.848
- Don't look at me. I didn't take shit.
- I know he was there.

01:08:19.098 --> 01:08:21.017
I am not dreaming,
I am not crazy.

01:08:21.267 --> 01:08:24.478
- He was there in Woodsboro.
- That's not Woodsboro, Sidney.

01:08:24.729 --> 01:08:29.317
You know what I mean. But he was there.
He or she, or whoever this is.

01:08:29.567 --> 01:08:32.111
We're gonna take you back
to the station, keep you under watch.

01:08:32.361 --> 01:08:34.697
Put you in a safe house.
Whatever it takes.

01:08:34.947 --> 01:08:38.451
Come on.

01:08:38.451 --> 01:08:41.162
It's all right, Sid.
We all believe you.

01:08:41.412 --> 01:08:45.082
- He's watching.
- And he wants you.

01:08:48.002 --> 01:08:49.795
- Hey, Dew.
- Dew.
- Come on.

01:08:50.046 --> 01:08:52.673
- We have to go catch up with Sid.
- Take a look at this first.

01:08:52.924 --> 01:08:54.841
- Someone we know?
- Where'd you get this?

01:08:55.091 --> 01:08:58.470
- We got it. Archives.
- Sidney's mother was an actress.
Three movies.

01:08:58.720 --> 01:09:03.267
-Horror movies.
-Wanna know who produced all three?
-Who?

01:09:03.518 --> 01:09:05.394
- There'll be other movies, Roman.
- Not only did they--

01:09:05.645 --> 01:09:08.606
did they kill the film,
but they killed my cast.

01:09:08.856 --> 01:09:11.943
Now, nobody's gonna wanna work
with me. Variety called me a pariah.

01:09:12.193 --> 01:09:15.696
I don't even know what a pariah is.
Why-Why couldn't someone
have killed the cast from Stab 1?

01:09:15.947 --> 01:09:18.323
Huh? Or Stab 2? Why me?
What--John, what did we do wrong?

01:09:18.573 --> 01:09:20.868
Hollywood is full of criminals
whose careers are flourishing.

01:09:21.118 --> 01:09:23.328
I'm not a criminal!
I was questioned.

01:09:23.578 --> 01:09:25.413
Yeah, but that's all.
I was questioned. That's it.

01:09:25.665 --> 01:09:28.501
- That's good foryour mystique.
- You think it will help me get work?

01:09:28.751 --> 01:09:30.711
Roman. John.

01:09:30.962 --> 01:09:33.881
Jennifer, and guests.
To what do I owe the honour?

01:09:34.131 --> 01:09:37.926
- Rina Reynolds.
- Rina Reynolds? Who's Rina Reynolds?

01:09:38.176 --> 01:09:41.639
Why don't you head to the house?
Tell everybody not to cut
the cake without me.

01:09:41.889 --> 01:09:44.183
- Oh, God, I forgot. Your birthday.
- Yeah.

01:09:44.433 --> 01:09:47.185
- Happy birthday, Roman.
- Yeah, as if life isn't tragic enough.

01:09:47.435 --> 01:09:52.149
Shut the doors behind you, please.

01:09:53.067 --> 01:09:55.361
So, you knew
Sidney Prescott's mother.

01:09:55.611 --> 01:09:58.823
- Who?
- Rina Reynolds?

01:09:59.073 --> 01:10:02.243
Do you know how many actors have
worked for me? Hundreds. Thousands.

01:10:02.493 --> 01:10:05.788
- He didn't say she was an actor.
- Good catch.

01:10:06.038 --> 01:10:08.291
- So what's the point?
- Uh, no point.

01:10:08.541 --> 01:10:11.335
I'm just gonna give, uh,
Detective Kincaid a call.

01:10:11.586 --> 01:10:15.339
I remember. She was a bit player
in a couple of my movies.

01:10:15.590 --> 01:10:18.009
- A nobody. So what does it matter?
- Oh, come on.

01:10:18.259 --> 01:10:21.804
You have made millions
off the story of her murder.

01:10:22.054 --> 01:10:24.891
You're obsessed with her,
and you're obsessed with her daughter!

01:10:25.141 --> 01:10:28.269
All right, easy, Geraldo.
Why don't you tell us the truth?

01:10:28.519 --> 01:10:32.523
What the hell are you guys getting at?
I make horror films, that's what I do.

01:10:32.773 --> 01:10:34.775
The studio came to me with Stab.

01:10:35.026 --> 01:10:37.737
They came to me.
Check it out.

01:10:37.987 --> 01:10:40.615
- But you knew who she was.
- When we did the first Stab...

01:10:40.865 --> 01:10:43.075
I realized I had known
Maureen Prescott before.

01:10:43.326 --> 01:10:45.620
I mean, as Rina.

01:10:45.870 --> 01:10:49.624
I couldn't tell anyone.
Can you imagine the press?

01:10:49.874 --> 01:10:52.210
And now?
I mean, murders on your set.

01:10:52.460 --> 01:10:54.795
- And-And still you say nothing?
- Get real.

01:10:55.046 --> 01:10:57.423
- That would make me a suspect.
-Just because you knew her?

01:10:57.673 --> 01:10:59.967
- Yeah.
- I don't think so.

01:11:00.218 --> 01:11:03.971
Just what did happen to Maureen
when she was in Hollywood?

01:11:04.722 --> 01:11:07.308
Now, you listen to me, Lois Lane.
Let it go. It's dead and buried.

01:11:07.558 --> 01:11:10.770
How would you like to see it
dug up on national TV?

01:11:11.020 --> 01:11:14.524
Why don't you tell me
what happened?

01:11:15.733 --> 01:11:18.945
It was in the '70s.
Everything was different.

01:11:19.195 --> 01:11:22.907
I was well-known for my parties.
Rina knew what they were.

01:11:23.157 --> 01:11:27.495
It was for girls like her to meet men.
Men who could get them parts...

01:11:27.745 --> 01:11:29.580
if they made
the right impression.

01:11:29.830 --> 01:11:31.999
Nothing happened to her
that she didn't invite...

01:11:32.250 --> 01:11:35.461
in one way or another
no matter what she said afterwards.

01:11:35.711 --> 01:11:38.881
- Are you saying she--
- I'm saying things got out of hand.

01:11:39.131 --> 01:11:43.010
Maybe they did take advantage of her.
You know, Maybe the sad truth is...

01:11:43.261 --> 01:11:46.806
this is not the city
for innocents.

01:11:47.056 --> 01:11:49.976
No charges were brought.
And the bottom line is...

01:11:50.226 --> 01:11:52.770
Rina Reynolds
wouldn't play by the rules.

01:11:53.020 --> 01:11:55.189
You wanna get ahead in Hollywood?

01:11:55.439 --> 01:12:00.319
You gotta play the game, or go home.

01:12:04.907 --> 01:12:07.451
What do you know
about trilogies?

01:12:07.702 --> 01:12:11.080
- You mean, like movie trilogies?
- You seem to like movies, Detective.

01:12:11.330 --> 01:12:15.668
Call me Mark, would you? 'Cause
I'm gonna keep calling you Sidney.

01:12:15.918 --> 01:12:19.755
I'll call you Mark when
you catch the killer, Detective.

01:12:20.506 --> 01:12:24.552
All I know about movie trilogies
is that in the third one...

01:12:24.802 --> 01:12:28.639
all bets are off.

01:12:28.681 --> 01:12:30.683
- Did you request this case?
- No. They tend to put me...

01:12:30.933 --> 01:12:32.768
on the ones that deal
with the business.

01:12:33.019 --> 01:12:36.105
I grew up here,
and I know my way around the studios.

01:12:36.355 --> 01:12:38.566
Huh.

01:12:38.816 --> 01:12:42.195
Must be exciting.
Beautiful place, beautiful people.

01:12:42.445 --> 01:12:46.199
To me, Hollywood is about death.

01:12:46.699 --> 01:12:49.243
Excuse me?

01:12:49.493 --> 01:12:52.830
I'm a homicide detective, remember?

01:12:53.080 --> 01:12:55.791
And when you see what I see
day in and day out...

01:12:56.042 --> 01:12:58.461
the violence
that people do to each other...

01:12:58.711 --> 01:13:00.546
you get haunted.

01:13:00.796 --> 01:13:04.300
I think you know about that.

01:13:05.051 --> 01:13:07.261
What do you mean?

01:13:07.512 --> 01:13:10.515
I know what it's like
to see ghosts that don't go away.

01:13:10.765 --> 01:13:16.062
To be watching a scary movie in
your head, whether you want to or not.

01:13:16.354 --> 01:13:21.150
Watching it alone.

01:13:22.026 --> 01:13:24.529
Ghosts are tough.
You can't shoot ghosts.

01:13:24.779 --> 01:13:27.573
Can't arrest ghosts.

01:13:27.823 --> 01:13:31.244
But the best way to stop being
haunted is to be with people.

01:13:31.494 --> 01:13:33.412
You're here, you're not hiding.

01:13:33.663 --> 01:13:38.626
You've done the right thing,
Miss Prescott.

01:13:41.629 --> 01:13:45.466
What did you know about your mother?

01:13:48.594 --> 01:13:51.138
I always thought
I had the perfect mom.

01:13:51.389 --> 01:13:54.892
Perfect family.

01:13:55.852 --> 01:14:00.898
Till I found out I was wrong.
She, um--

01:14:02.191 --> 01:14:07.154
She had a secret life, and I tried
to understand that, and, um...

01:14:07.405 --> 01:14:13.077
soon as I thought that I had,
more secrets.

01:14:15.246 --> 01:14:18.165
I don't know who my mom was.

01:14:18.416 --> 01:14:22.253
You know who she was to you.

01:14:25.298 --> 01:14:27.258
Here's the deal.
I'm off to search the set.

01:14:27.508 --> 01:14:31.637
I think what you saw is real.
That's the good news.

01:14:31.888 --> 01:14:33.973
- How is that good news?
- Because that means...

01:14:34.223 --> 01:14:37.185
that we're dealing with
an ordinary flesh-and-blood killer.

01:14:37.435 --> 01:14:40.855
- And I know how
to handle guys like that.
- Oh, yeah? How?

01:14:41.105 --> 01:14:45.568
Catch him or kill him.

01:14:47.612 --> 01:14:51.532
Hey, Detective.

01:14:51.782 --> 01:14:55.786
What's your favourite
scary movie?

01:14:58.080 --> 01:15:01.584
My life.

01:15:03.085 --> 01:15:05.630
Mine too.

01:15:06.380 --> 01:15:08.257
We have to think.
Strategize.

01:15:08.508 --> 01:15:11.260
- Milton's the key to everything.
- He's a pervert, he's not a killer.

01:15:11.511 --> 01:15:14.222
He's gotta be involved somehow.
We should follow him.

01:15:14.472 --> 01:15:16.307
We're gonna go back to the precinct and
we're gonna tell Kincaid and Sidney...

01:15:16.557 --> 01:15:18.601
what we found out.

01:15:18.851 --> 01:15:22.188
My Gale would be much more aggressive.
My Gale would suspect everybody.

01:15:22.438 --> 01:15:26.192
- My Gale would--
- Shut up!
- Shut up!

01:15:27.818 --> 01:15:30.363
- Riley here.
- Dewey, it's Sidney.
- Hey, Sid.

01:15:30.613 --> 01:15:32.532
- I'm with Gale.
We're on our way to see you.
- No.

01:15:32.782 --> 01:15:36.118
Listen, I'm not at the station.
John Milton called me and said
he had something to tell me.

01:15:36.369 --> 01:15:38.663
Something about my mom.
I'm going to meet him at his house.

01:15:38.913 --> 01:15:41.082
Wait, Sid, I'm not so sure
that's a good idea.

01:15:41.332 --> 01:15:44.168
It's okay. Kincaid's with me.
I've got official big-time...

01:15:44.418 --> 01:15:47.672
L.A.P.D. protection, but
I'd feel better if you were there.

01:15:47.922 --> 01:15:52.009
- We're on our way, but still, Sid--
- Thanks.

01:15:52.260 --> 01:15:57.557
- What?
- Looks like we're going
to that party after all.

01:16:06.983 --> 01:16:09.694
Hey, guys. Come on in.
Join the party.

01:16:09.944 --> 01:16:11.821
Yeah, well, actually,
we're here to see Sidney.

01:16:12.071 --> 01:16:14.115
- Really? Sidney's here.
- Where?

01:16:14.365 --> 01:16:17.535
- Where's Sidney?
- She's right there!

01:16:17.785 --> 01:16:21.080
Jesus!
Not "Sidney," Sidney.

01:16:21.330 --> 01:16:24.709
- Like I'm "Gale" and she's Gale.
- Sidney Prescott?

01:16:24.959 --> 01:16:27.670
- Yeah.
- No, I'd never invite her here.

01:16:27.920 --> 01:16:31.507
- She's on her way.
- Well, the more the merrier.

01:16:31.757 --> 01:16:35.469
God, this house is incredible.

01:16:35.720 --> 01:16:38.598
-It's old Hollywood.
-Yeah. Could the dude have more money?

01:16:38.848 --> 01:16:41.726
Supposedly, Milton has
a secret screening room...

01:16:41.976 --> 01:16:43.811
that was like the scene
back in the '70s, you know.

01:16:44.061 --> 01:16:48.191
It was, like, drinks and drugs
and girls and movies and shit.

01:16:48.441 --> 01:16:51.110
Wow! Wish I could've seen it.

01:16:51.360 --> 01:16:53.237
Big old screening room
shouldn't be too hard to find.

01:16:53.487 --> 01:16:55.323
I'm gonna go--
I'm gonna go check this place out.

01:16:55.573 --> 01:16:58.951
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Just one damn minute.
There's a psycho killer on the loose.

01:16:59.202 --> 01:17:01.662
And you want to go traipsing around
this gigantic mansion?

01:17:01.913 --> 01:17:04.248
Have you ever actually seen
the Stab movies? Every time...

01:17:04.498 --> 01:17:07.043
this dude enters a room,
he ends up a goddam shish kebab.

01:17:07.293 --> 01:17:10.296
- I'll go with you, Roman.
- There you go. You guys wanna come?

01:17:10.546 --> 01:17:14.467
It'll be okay.
We're gonna stick together.

01:17:14.717 --> 01:17:18.221
-You're not stickin'. Wait up.
-We're gonna stay here and wait for Sid.

01:17:18.471 --> 01:17:21.599
We'll be right back!

01:17:21.849 --> 01:17:24.894
If-If you were a screening room...

01:17:25.144 --> 01:17:28.648
where would you be?

01:17:29.941 --> 01:17:33.444
I bet in the basement.

01:17:34.654 --> 01:17:38.658
I don't like basements.

01:17:41.077 --> 01:17:44.580
Ooh, it's spooky.

01:17:55.716 --> 01:17:57.677
- Ooh, Weredad.
- Damn, it's dark in here.

01:17:57.927 --> 01:18:00.471
- I loved that movie.
- Forget the movie!
What if Milton's crazy...

01:18:00.721 --> 01:18:03.224
and he's gonna jump outta his screening
room with a sling blade or something?

01:18:03.474 --> 01:18:06.978
- He won't.
- You sure about that?

01:18:11.315 --> 01:18:14.777
- What's down there?
- Zombies and aliens.

01:18:15.027 --> 01:18:17.446
You know, what you look like
without make-up, Jennifer.

01:18:17.697 --> 01:18:20.825
Jesus. Stop pretending
I wasn't the best you've ever had.

01:18:21.075 --> 01:18:26.664
- Oh, stop pretending I even remember.
- Stop pretending!

01:18:30.334 --> 01:18:33.754
Roman?

01:18:44.223 --> 01:18:47.727
Roman?

01:18:51.147 --> 01:18:54.442
- Any sign of her?
- No.

01:18:54.692 --> 01:18:56.944
This is so strange.

01:18:57.195 --> 01:18:59.030
It sure is.

01:18:59.280 --> 01:19:01.282
Dewey, do you have caller I.D.
on your cell phone?

01:19:01.532 --> 01:19:05.203
-Yeah.
-All right, use it and-and press "send."

01:19:14.045 --> 01:19:17.548
What the hell?

01:19:27.600 --> 01:19:31.604
What is this thing?

01:19:32.230 --> 01:19:36.400
Is this what he--
What the hell?

01:19:37.985 --> 01:19:40.279
Dewey, he's got our voices.

01:19:40.530 --> 01:19:42.365
He's got Sid.

01:19:42.615 --> 01:19:44.450
He's got us all.

01:19:44.700 --> 01:19:48.412
- Oh, my God. We gotta find her.
- Come on.

01:19:48.663 --> 01:19:51.040
All right, take the gun.

01:19:51.290 --> 01:19:53.501
Go find Roman and Jennifer.
I'm gonna get the others.

01:19:53.751 --> 01:19:57.255
- Be careful.
- You too.

01:19:58.422 --> 01:20:04.178
Tyson! Angelina!
You up there?

01:20:05.054 --> 01:20:07.849
- Roman!
- Tyson!

01:20:08.099 --> 01:20:10.309
Angelina!

01:20:10.560 --> 01:20:13.437
Damn it!

01:20:13.688 --> 01:20:15.606
Okay, come on.
We gotta get out of here.

01:20:15.857 --> 01:20:17.942
- Where's Angelina?
- I don't know. She went in here.

01:20:18.192 --> 01:20:20.236
- I came in after her. Now she's gone.
- Great.

01:20:20.486 --> 01:20:25.283
- What's wrong?
- Looks like Stab 3
is back in production.

01:20:26.909 --> 01:20:30.204
Roman!

01:20:30.454 --> 01:20:34.542
Jennifer!

01:20:44.635 --> 01:20:48.639
Jennifer!

01:20:52.393 --> 01:20:55.396
Roman!

01:20:55.646 --> 01:20:59.150
Jennifer!

01:21:06.157 --> 01:21:10.620
Roman?

01:21:25.510 --> 01:21:27.345
- Is he dead?
- Yeah, very.

01:21:27.595 --> 01:21:31.682
Dewey! Dewey!

01:21:35.186 --> 01:21:38.064
Dewey?

01:21:38.314 --> 01:21:40.775
Dewey!

01:21:41.025 --> 01:21:43.236
God, I'm sorry.
Jennifer, Gale, look.

01:21:43.486 --> 01:21:45.947
- I found a secret passage.
- Roman's dead.

01:21:46.197 --> 01:21:48.658
- What?
- The killer's here.
- What?

01:21:48.908 --> 01:21:52.370
- Let go of me! I'm getting out of here!
- You're not safe alone!

01:21:52.620 --> 01:21:54.455
Listen to me!

01:21:54.705 --> 01:21:58.793
I did not fuck that pig Milton
to get a leading role...

01:21:59.043 --> 01:22:04.507
just to die here with second-rate
celebrities like you two!

01:22:06.467 --> 01:22:09.637
- Gale! I'm up here.
- Come on.

01:22:09.887 --> 01:22:13.307
- Dewey!
- You guys should get out too.

01:22:13.558 --> 01:22:17.562
It's crazy to still be here.

01:22:22.775 --> 01:22:27.321
- Wait!
- Come on!

01:22:41.836 --> 01:22:44.755
- Dewey!
- Gale, Jennifer, up here!

01:22:45.006 --> 01:22:47.717
Dewey, here.
He got Roman and Angelina too.

01:22:47.967 --> 01:22:51.804
- We'll be safer if we
stick together, won't we?
- Of course. Why--

01:22:53.931 --> 01:22:55.725
What's goin' on?
Oh, shit!

01:22:55.975 --> 01:22:59.312
- Hey!
- Dewey!

01:22:59.353 --> 01:23:02.273
Dewey!

01:23:02.523 --> 01:23:05.943
No!

01:23:14.660 --> 01:23:17.872
Help! Police!
Help! Help!

01:23:18.122 --> 01:23:22.335
Police! Help!

01:23:28.925 --> 01:23:32.512
Oh, you motherfucker!

01:24:09.507 --> 01:24:13.010
Damn!

01:24:15.847 --> 01:24:20.726
Dewey! Dewey!

01:24:22.979 --> 01:24:27.149
Behind the mirror, Dewey!

01:24:27.900 --> 01:24:30.236
Gale! Get away! Dewey!

01:24:30.486 --> 01:24:32.655
- Do you hear something?
- Get away from me, you asshole.

01:24:32.905 --> 01:24:37.577
- Get away from me! You don't scare me!
- Look, Gale. The mirror's moving.

01:24:37.827 --> 01:24:41.163
- Gale! Gale!
- Stand back, Gale.

01:24:41.414 --> 01:24:44.542
You can't kill me. I'm the killer
in Stab 3. I'm the killer!

01:24:44.792 --> 01:24:49.046
Gale, cover!

01:24:49.630 --> 01:24:53.217
Dewey!

01:25:02.476 --> 01:25:04.812
- Tyson!
- Tyson!

01:25:05.062 --> 01:25:06.898
I'm gonna check down here.
You call for help.

01:25:07.148 --> 01:25:09.358
Okay.

01:25:09.609 --> 01:25:12.653
Tyson!

01:25:12.904 --> 01:25:16.407
- Tyson?
- Any sign of him?

01:25:16.657 --> 01:25:20.244
- No.
- All right. I'm gonna check out front.

01:25:25.958 --> 01:25:29.462
Dew--

01:25:53.236 --> 01:25:56.739
Gale!

01:25:57.615 --> 01:26:01.536
Gale!

01:26:02.161 --> 01:26:04.539
Gale!

01:26:04.789 --> 01:26:08.793
- Dewey?
- Gale!

01:26:10.169 --> 01:26:13.673
Gale!

01:26:17.260 --> 01:26:19.762
- Who is this?
- Dewey, it's me.

01:26:20.012 --> 01:26:22.890
Gale, where are you?

01:26:23.140 --> 01:26:25.518
I'm in the basement.
I'm trapped.

01:26:25.768 --> 01:26:29.522
- Where?
- There's a door in the kitchen.

01:26:30.565 --> 01:26:34.151
Hurry.

01:26:36.279 --> 01:26:40.241
Wait. How do I know this is
you, Gale, and not the killer?

01:26:40.491 --> 01:26:43.870
Dewey, open the fucking door.
It's me.

01:26:44.120 --> 01:26:46.789
Well, don't you think that's
what the killer would say?

01:26:47.039 --> 01:26:53.462
Come on. He's out cold
at the bottom of the stairs.

01:26:54.172 --> 01:26:57.842
Hey!

01:27:09.270 --> 01:27:13.357
Dewey. Dewey.

01:27:22.491 --> 01:27:24.368
All right, all right.
It's pizza, not a party.

01:27:24.619 --> 01:27:29.040
Everybody get back to work.
Anybody seen my fuckin' partner?

01:27:29.290 --> 01:27:32.793
Hey, Morgan,
what did you pay?

01:28:20.675 --> 01:28:23.845
- Hello?
- Hello?

01:28:24.095 --> 01:28:26.514
- Who is this?
- Who is this?

01:28:26.764 --> 01:28:31.853
- Um, w-who's calling?
- Um, w-who's calling?

01:28:32.103 --> 01:28:37.358
Gale, Dewey, whoever, um, call me back.
I can only hear myself.

01:28:37.608 --> 01:28:42.154
I only hear you too, Sidney.

01:28:42.321 --> 01:28:45.616
- Who is this?
- The question isn't who I am.

01:28:45.867 --> 01:28:49.579
The question is:
Who's with me?

01:28:49.829 --> 01:28:51.664
- Sidney, stay away!
- Sidney!

01:28:51.914 --> 01:28:55.251
Don't do it. If you do one thing
to attract attention to yourself...

01:28:55.501 --> 01:28:58.171
one thing,
I'll kill them both.

01:28:58.421 --> 01:29:03.885
Now, do you have somewhere
we can be alone?

01:29:04.135 --> 01:29:08.431
- Yes.
- Yeah. Go there.

01:29:13.728 --> 01:29:16.397
Oh, it's hard being friends
with you, Sidney.

01:29:16.647 --> 01:29:19.609
When you're friends with Sidney,
you die.

01:29:19.859 --> 01:29:24.155
Well, these friends don't have to,
Sidney. It's up to you.

01:29:24.405 --> 01:29:26.324
- How do I know their voices are--
- Are real?

01:29:26.574 --> 01:29:28.492
How do you know
you're not hearing things?

01:29:28.743 --> 01:29:33.873
How do you know I'm not someone
in your head? Somewhere you know.

01:29:34.123 --> 01:29:36.501
- Don't come here, Sidney!
- Dewey!

01:29:36.751 --> 01:29:39.837
- Or do you?
- You're dead.

01:29:40.087 --> 01:29:42.340
I don't want them.
I want you.

01:29:42.590 --> 01:29:45.176
It's simple.
You show yourself, they survive.

01:29:45.426 --> 01:29:47.803
- You run, they die.
- Oh, God!

01:29:48.054 --> 01:29:51.933
Don't you wanna know, Sidney,
who killed her?

01:29:52.183 --> 01:29:55.520
Don't you wanna know
who killed your mother?

01:29:55.770 --> 01:29:57.605
- Have you seen Kincaid?
- Yeah, I saw him go out.

01:29:57.855 --> 01:29:59.524
- Wallace is still lookin' for him.
- Where?

01:29:59.774 --> 01:30:03.736
She'd have been so happy, Sidney,
to know we'd be together.

01:30:03.986 --> 01:30:09.283
- Where?
- I'll call you when you're on your way.

01:30:11.744 --> 01:30:15.957
Shit. Shit. Shit.

01:31:23.149 --> 01:31:27.236
Holy shit.

01:31:35.453 --> 01:31:37.747
- What?
- You follow directions well, Sidney.

01:31:37.997 --> 01:31:40.041
Now, welcome to the final act.

01:31:40.291 --> 01:31:42.877
See that metal detector?

01:31:43.127 --> 01:31:47.048
Use it.

01:31:49.884 --> 01:31:54.430
All over, Sidney.
Everywhere.

01:31:57.600 --> 01:32:02.897
Everywhere.
The other leg too.

01:32:05.650 --> 01:32:09.320
Show it to me.

01:32:13.407 --> 01:32:16.911
Throw it in the pool.

01:32:18.621 --> 01:32:20.456
Now, come inside, Sidney.

01:32:20.706 --> 01:32:23.501
No fucking way. How do I know
they're not dead already?

01:32:23.751 --> 01:32:26.963
They're right inside,
waiting for you.

01:32:27.213 --> 01:32:30.716
Look for yourself.

01:32:40.810 --> 01:32:45.815
Now that we're all here,
the party can begin.

01:32:46.065 --> 01:32:49.318
- Dewey.
- Sid.

01:32:49.569 --> 01:32:52.446
- Where is he?
- I don't know.

01:32:52.697 --> 01:32:56.617
He's right there!

01:33:01.205 --> 01:33:03.833
Oh, shit.

01:33:04.083 --> 01:33:05.751
Think again.

01:33:06.002 --> 01:33:09.922
It's your turn to scream, asshole.

01:33:11.799 --> 01:33:16.179
Yeah!

01:33:19.265 --> 01:33:22.602
- It's okay.Just give me a second.
- Okay.

01:33:22.852 --> 01:33:27.899
- Hurry, Sid.
- Sidney? Sidney?

01:33:29.192 --> 01:33:33.112
Where is he?

01:33:34.864 --> 01:33:38.451
Be careful!

01:33:44.165 --> 01:33:47.585
I heard shots. Tyson's dead.
What's goin' on?

01:33:47.835 --> 01:33:50.379
- What're you doin' here, Kincaid?
- Lookin' for you.

01:33:50.630 --> 01:33:53.633
Tyson said there was a party here
tonight, and I thought, uh-oh.

01:33:53.883 --> 01:33:55.801
Third act celebration.
Thought I better check it out.

01:33:56.052 --> 01:33:59.972
Alone?
Where's your partner?

01:34:02.350 --> 01:34:05.144
Hey, Miss Prescott.

01:34:05.394 --> 01:34:10.107
I'm here to help.
Put the gun down.

01:34:11.025 --> 01:34:14.445
Put the gun down.

01:34:17.240 --> 01:34:21.327
No!

01:34:24.830 --> 01:34:29.252
Sid! Wake up, Sid!
Sid, come on!

01:34:29.502 --> 01:34:33.381
- Wake up!
- Sidney!

01:34:33.631 --> 01:34:35.925
Sid, shoot him! Sid!

01:34:36.175 --> 01:34:39.887
Shoot the fucker!

01:34:40.137 --> 01:34:44.517
Shoot him!

01:34:47.687 --> 01:34:50.648
You want me, motherfucker?
Come and get me.

01:34:50.898 --> 01:34:55.152
Run!

01:35:41.699 --> 01:35:44.660
Sid.

01:35:44.911 --> 01:35:48.289
Sid.

01:35:48.539 --> 01:35:54.128
Come in here, please.

01:35:55.004 --> 01:35:58.966
It's just me, Sid.

01:35:59.217 --> 01:36:02.929
Oh, I was so pretty.

01:36:03.179 --> 01:36:06.432
Everybody loved me.

01:36:06.682 --> 01:36:11.145
Have you missed me, Sidney?

01:36:11.729 --> 01:36:17.401
Would you like to hold me
one last time?

01:36:17.735 --> 01:36:20.488
What's the matter?
What are you staring at?

01:36:20.738 --> 01:36:26.744
Don't you remember your mother?

01:36:36.629 --> 01:36:38.631
You're not going anywhere, Sidney.

01:36:38.881 --> 01:36:44.720
It's time you came to terms
with me and with Mother.

01:36:45.680 --> 01:36:48.432
Maybe you never
knew her at all, Sidney.

01:36:48.683 --> 01:36:53.646
Maybe you just can't get past
the surface of things.

01:36:53.896 --> 01:36:57.567
- Who the hell are you?
- The other half of you.

01:36:57.817 --> 01:37:01.737
I searched for a mother too,
an actress named Rina Reynolds.

01:37:01.988 --> 01:37:03.865
Tried to find her my whole life.

01:37:04.115 --> 01:37:06.909
And four years ago,
I actually tracked her down.

01:37:07.159 --> 01:37:10.288
Knocked at her door, thinking
she'd welcome me with open arms.

01:37:10.538 --> 01:37:14.917
But she had a new life
and a new name: Maureen Prescott.

01:37:15.168 --> 01:37:17.044
You were the only child
she claimed, Sidney.

01:37:17.295 --> 01:37:20.131
She shut me out
in the cold forever.

01:37:20.381 --> 01:37:24.468
Her own son.

01:37:28.764 --> 01:37:33.603
Roman Bridger, director.
And brother.

01:37:33.853 --> 01:37:36.397
She slammed the door in my face, Sid.
She said I was Rina's child...

01:37:36.647 --> 01:37:38.733
and Rina was dead.

01:37:38.983 --> 01:37:40.902
And it struck me.

01:37:41.152 --> 01:37:44.322
What a good idea!
So I watched her.

01:37:44.572 --> 01:37:48.451
I made a little home movie.
A little-little family film.

01:37:48.701 --> 01:37:51.621
It seems Maureen--
Mom--

01:37:51.871 --> 01:37:55.833
She really got around.
I mean, Cotton was one thing.

01:37:56.083 --> 01:37:58.127
Everybody knew about that.

01:37:58.377 --> 01:38:02.924
But Billy's father?
That was the key.

01:38:03.174 --> 01:38:05.134
Your boyfriend didn't like seeing
his daddy in my film too much.

01:38:05.384 --> 01:38:07.512
He didn't like it at all.

01:38:07.762 --> 01:38:11.891
But once I supplied the motivation,
all the kid needed was a few pointers.

01:38:12.141 --> 01:38:15.353
Have a partner to sell out in case
you get caught, find someone to frame.

01:38:15.603 --> 01:38:17.897
It was like
he was making a movie.

01:38:18.147 --> 01:38:22.652
You. This is all because ofyou.

01:38:22.902 --> 01:38:26.322
I'm a director, Sid.

01:38:26.572 --> 01:38:28.824
- I direct.
- Oh.

01:38:29.075 --> 01:38:33.955
I had no idea that they were
gonna make a film of their own.

01:38:34.830 --> 01:38:38.501
- Oh, shit.
- What a film it turned out to be, huh?

01:38:38.751 --> 01:38:41.546
I mean, introducing Sidney,
the victim.

01:38:41.796 --> 01:38:46.759
Sidney, the survivor.
Sidney, the star!

01:39:01.065 --> 01:39:03.150
All right. You're gonna be all right.
Just apply pressure.

01:39:03.401 --> 01:39:05.653
Here, take this.
Get the son ofa bitch.

01:39:05.903 --> 01:39:07.405
Let's go.

01:39:07.655 --> 01:39:10.491
Fine, you got what you wanted,
hero and villain face-to-face.

01:39:10.741 --> 01:39:13.411
- Well, you know what happens now?
The villain dies!
- Exactly!

01:39:13.661 --> 01:39:17.915
But I'm not the villain, Sid.
You are.

01:39:18.165 --> 01:39:22.587
Here he is, the man who gave away
your mother's innocence.

01:39:22.837 --> 01:39:25.173
Huh? What he did
to her made her a slut.

01:39:25.423 --> 01:39:29.635
Didn't it? Huh? She never recovered from
that night, right here in this room.

01:39:29.886 --> 01:39:33.347
They fucked her three ways from Sunday.
Ruined her life.

01:39:33.598 --> 01:39:35.266
Ruined yours too,
didn't it, Sid?

01:39:35.516 --> 01:39:37.894
You hate him, Sid?

01:39:38.144 --> 01:39:43.733
Come on, I know you do.
I'm sure you do.

01:39:43.941 --> 01:39:46.277
I know who you are.
I know what happened to my mother.

01:39:46.527 --> 01:39:49.322
And I want you to understand,
I'm gonna make you pay!

01:39:49.572 --> 01:39:51.407
That's what the police are gonna
find on Milton's answering machine...

01:39:51.657 --> 01:39:55.203
right next to his lifeless,
mutilated corpse.

01:39:55.453 --> 01:39:57.580
- What? Can't hear ya.
- You don't have to do this, Roman.

01:39:57.830 --> 01:39:59.707
Just tell me what you want.
I can make it happen.

01:39:59.957 --> 01:40:01.876
Any picture.
Name your budget. Script approval.

01:40:02.126 --> 01:40:04.212
- Final cut!
- I already have it.

01:40:04.462 --> 01:40:07.798
No!

01:40:08.508 --> 01:40:10.343
God! You spineless bastard!

01:40:10.593 --> 01:40:13.429
No, Sid, that would be you.
You did it all.

01:40:13.679 --> 01:40:17.600
You did it, you called them all.
Even your closest friends.

01:40:17.850 --> 01:40:20.228
Living in total isolation, the pressure
ofanother movie about you...

01:40:20.478 --> 01:40:23.481
the discovery that Milton
destroyed Mommy dearest...

01:40:23.731 --> 01:40:26.817
you finally just snapped!

01:40:27.068 --> 01:40:31.447
One, two, three!

01:40:32.490 --> 01:40:36.160
And who's our hero, huh?
The sole survivor. Who's the one...

01:40:36.410 --> 01:40:40.206
who bravely faced down the psychopath
and killed her with her own knife?

01:40:40.456 --> 01:40:42.667
You're gonna pay for the life
you stole from me, Sid.

01:40:42.917 --> 01:40:46.629
For the mother, and for the family,
and for the stardom and--

01:40:46.879 --> 01:40:49.006
Goddam it! Everything you have
that should've been mine!

01:40:49.257 --> 01:40:52.260
God! Why don't you stop your whining
and get on with it?
I've heard this shit before!

01:40:52.510 --> 01:40:54.720
- Stop!
- You know why you kill people,
Roman? Do you?

01:40:54.971 --> 01:40:57.932
- I don't wanna hear it!
- Because you choose to!
There is no one else to blame!

01:40:58.182 --> 01:41:01.394
- Stop it! Fucking damn it!
- Why don't you take
some fucking responsibility?

01:41:01.644 --> 01:41:05.481
- Fuck you!
- Fuck you!

01:41:17.201 --> 01:41:20.705
Sid? Sidney?

01:41:28.212 --> 01:41:31.716
Sidney?

01:41:38.764 --> 01:41:41.851
Sidney!

01:41:54.530 --> 01:41:57.450
Sidney!

01:41:59.619 --> 01:42:02.705
Leave her alone!

01:42:12.548 --> 01:42:15.718
Dewey, do something!

01:42:18.721 --> 01:42:23.267
- Stand back!
- Dewey!

01:42:26.437 --> 01:42:30.274
Sid! Sid.

01:42:53.589 --> 01:42:57.510
Sid?

01:42:59.887 --> 01:43:03.641
Where is he?

01:43:16.404 --> 01:43:19.657
Hey. Lose something?

01:43:19.907 --> 01:43:23.244
Found something.

01:43:44.682 --> 01:43:49.312
There's gotta be another way in there!
Come on!

01:43:54.150 --> 01:43:58.863
You hurt her,
I swear I'll kill you!

01:44:11.459 --> 01:44:15.713
-Dewey!
-Down this way. There's another hallway.

01:44:26.474 --> 01:44:29.977
There's another door down here.

01:44:35.775 --> 01:44:38.027
- This thing's not budging.
- Look around for something heavy.

01:44:38.277 --> 01:44:42.448
- Go that way.
- Okay!

01:45:07.014 --> 01:45:10.685
I shot you.

01:45:14.397 --> 01:45:19.026
I guess we think alike.

01:45:19.026 --> 01:45:21.779
Mother's dead.

01:45:22.029 --> 01:45:25.533
And there is nothing
you can do about that.

01:45:25.700 --> 01:45:28.911
I still got
to make my movie.

01:45:29.161 --> 01:45:33.165
Stab 3, right?

01:45:49.348 --> 01:45:53.269
Kincaid, hang in there.

01:45:53.436 --> 01:45:58.566
Roman? It was Roman?

01:46:21.923 --> 01:46:27.220
Be careful, Sid. Randy said
the killer's always superhuman.

01:46:28.554 --> 01:46:32.350
Yeah, well,
he wasn't superhuman, Dewey.

01:46:32.600 --> 01:46:36.354
He wasn't superhuman at all.

01:46:40.441 --> 01:46:42.485
- You can't fuckin' kill me!
- Head!

01:46:42.735 --> 01:46:44.987
- Head! Head, Dewey!
- What?

01:46:45.238 --> 01:46:48.908
Head!
Shoot him in the head.

01:47:00.378 --> 01:47:02.421
Thanks.

01:47:02.672 --> 01:47:06.175
No problem.

01:47:31.242 --> 01:47:33.619
Look.

01:47:33.870 --> 01:47:35.997
Come on, Cherokee.
Come on.

01:47:36.247 --> 01:47:40.960
- Yeah, she's doin' great.
- Yeah.

01:47:44.630 --> 01:47:48.134
Look.

01:47:48.426 --> 01:47:50.386
What are you doing with that?

01:47:50.636 --> 01:47:54.348
Um, will you sign it
for me, Gale?

01:47:54.599 --> 01:47:56.851
You hate that book.

01:47:57.101 --> 01:48:00.229
Besides, I'm-l'm done
with that kind of reporting.

01:48:00.479 --> 01:48:05.860
For me.
Will you sign it for me?

01:48:07.069 --> 01:48:09.947
You're a nut.

01:48:10.198 --> 01:48:13.284
Okay.

01:48:22.001 --> 01:48:26.297
- Will you?
- Dewey.

01:48:26.547 --> 01:48:30.051
I know it'll never work,
and you know it'll never work.

01:48:30.301 --> 01:48:37.600
But what I'm asking is
just to see ifwe're wrong.

01:48:37.934 --> 01:48:41.854
We don't know everything, Gale.

01:48:42.730 --> 01:48:47.610
I mean, you think you do, but--

01:48:53.491 --> 01:48:57.078
You're a brave man,
Dewey Riley.

01:48:57.495 --> 01:49:01.666
I'm really scared right now.

01:49:44.500 --> 01:49:48.087
Inside.

01:49:52.808 --> 01:49:56.450
Sid, we've been waiting for you.
We're gonna start a movie.

01:49:56.500 --> 01:50:01.968
- What kind of movie?
- You have to come and see.

01:50:30.505 --> 01:50:34.217
Take a little walk
to the edge of town

01:50:34.467 --> 01:50:38.221
Now, spread your wings and fly

01:50:38.471 --> 01:50:42.433
Don't the lights of the city
look so damn pretty

01:50:42.683 --> 01:50:46.896
When you're flyin' so high

01:50:47.146 --> 01:50:50.650
It's hard to know
about there down below

01:50:50.900 --> 01:50:55.821
The streets fade
They're swimmin'deep in blood

01:50:56.072 --> 01:51:02.954
It seems to make me
groan and cry

01:51:03.579 --> 01:51:06.916
You really wanna know
what's wrong with this land

01:51:07.166 --> 01:51:12.839
Just scratch your head
with your red right hand

01:51:14.382 --> 01:51:18.886
I'm talkin'about blood, babe

01:51:19.136 --> 01:51:23.099
It's in your veins

01:51:23.349 --> 01:51:26.936
Your mommy and daddy

01:51:27.186 --> 01:51:30.857
They've got the same

01:51:32.400 --> 01:51:37.280
You're under the mirror
day after day

01:51:37.530 --> 01:51:41.242
You see a pretty face
crumblin' away

01:51:41.492 --> 01:51:48.541
As you become
your mom and daddy

01:51:48.666 --> 01:51:53.171
Scream once, scream twice
Now scream again

01:51:53.421 --> 01:51:59.427
Cover that face
with your red right hand

01:52:11.397 --> 01:52:15.943
So, is this the end

01:52:16.194 --> 01:52:20.990
Forus, my friend

01:52:24.410 --> 01:52:28.706
So, is this the end

01:52:28.956 --> 01:52:34.420
Forus, my friend

01:52:37.089 --> 01:52:41.511
So, is this the end

01:52:41.761 --> 01:52:47.225
Forus, my friend

01:53:04.075 --> 01:53:10.873
Well as though we rise

01:53:11.123 --> 01:53:16.671
As the day breaks the dawn

01:53:16.921 --> 01:53:23.719
And as the moon hides the sun

01:53:23.970 --> 01:53:27.890
Oh, the sun

01:53:29.600 --> 01:53:35.773
No more sorrow

01:53:36.691 --> 01:53:42.405
All those crying days are gone

01:53:42.655 --> 01:53:46.033
No more sorrow

01:53:46.284 --> 01:53:49.078
Now it'sgone

01:53:49.328 --> 01:53:52.331
Now it'sgone

01:53:52.582 --> 01:53:56.752
Now it'sgone

01:54:00.256 --> 01:54:04.927
So, is this the end

01:54:05.178 --> 01:54:11.767
Forus, my friend

01:54:14.854 --> 01:54:19.108
Spoke to my god today
Asked him why he'd gone away

01:54:19.358 --> 01:54:23.404
Hitched on a rocket ride
into the sun

01:54:23.654 --> 01:54:27.909
Said, son I got one for ya
Down there in California

01:54:28.159 --> 01:54:32.288
Just take a look around
at all you've done

01:54:32.538 --> 01:54:35.666
You're automatic
like a burnin' gun

01:54:35.917 --> 01:54:41.047
You're a star like everyone

01:54:41.380 --> 01:54:45.468
Talked to my soul today
Couldn't keep my brain away

01:54:45.718 --> 01:54:49.805
So I found a holiday
behind the sun

01:54:50.056 --> 01:54:54.268
Took all the friends I could
Spun out in Hollywood

01:54:54.519 --> 01:54:58.689
Hit up on a climate everyone

01:54:58.940 --> 01:55:02.068
You're automatic
like a burnin' gun

01:55:02.318 --> 01:55:07.698
You're a star like everyone

01:55:08.407 --> 01:55:12.495
You could save the world

01:55:12.745 --> 01:55:17.166
