00:04.022 --> 00:05.714
<i>Previously on</i> Stitchers...

00:05.739 --> 00:07.308
I told Nina I work in video games,

00:07.333 --> 00:09.138
and she's already wondering why I
spend so much time at the office.

00:09.163 --> 00:11.243
So, then you want to go to dinner?

00:11.268 --> 00:12.656
- I can't.
- Nina.

00:12.681 --> 00:14.857
You weren't at the university
library last night.

00:14.882 --> 00:17.985
It has nothing to do with you.

00:18.011 --> 00:19.320
Then who does it have to do with?

00:19.345 --> 00:21.199
Maybe I should take you
off your assignment.

00:21.224 --> 00:24.904
I've put in way too much time
grooming Liam to stop now.

00:24.929 --> 00:25.766
(gasps)

00:25.791 --> 00:28.124
I think that Liam has been
working with your father.

00:28.507 --> 00:30.964
Camille was trying to get
that information out of him.

00:30.989 --> 00:32.589
I don't want you to see Liam anymore.

00:32.613 --> 00:34.286
It's too dangerous. I'll do it.

00:34.311 --> 00:35.340
- Linus?
- Dad?

00:35.365 --> 00:37.382
This must be your son.
I didn't think you could make it

00:37.427 --> 00:38.852
to sign the medical power of attorney.

00:38.877 --> 00:39.944
We need to talk.

00:39.969 --> 00:43.099
I was created in the form of
someone your subconscious trusts.

00:43.124 --> 00:45.407
Hopefully,
you'll be predisposed to trust me.

00:45.432 --> 00:46.471
You have a sister.

00:46.496 --> 00:48.106
- What's her name?
- Ivy Brown.

00:50.970 --> 00:54.241
(phone ringing)

00:55.508 --> 00:57.195
<i>- Hello?</i>
- Ivy Brown?

00:57.220 --> 00:59.299
<i>Look, whatever you're selling,
I'm not interested.</i>

00:59.323 --> 01:01.863
Oh, no, no, no.
No, no, I'm not a salesperson.

01:02.114 --> 01:03.478
Um...

01:04.801 --> 01:07.435
My name is Kirsten Clark.

01:07.616 --> 01:12.289
I'm your sister... half-sister.
My father's Daniel Stinger.

01:14.754 --> 01:15.963
Ivy?

01:15.988 --> 01:17.282
<i>I know who you are.</i>

01:17.307 --> 01:18.213
<i>- I'm hanging up.</i>
- No! No, no, no!

01:18.238 --> 01:20.146
Wait, wait, please.

01:20.572 --> 01:22.322
I'm looking for our father.

01:22.347 --> 01:23.767
<i>Don't call me again.</i>

01:25.572 --> 01:27.551

01:27.576 --> 01:29.092

01:29.117 --> 01:30.915
<i>Hey, you've reached Ivy,
leave a message.</i>

01:31.718 --> 01:33.696
Hi, Ivy, it's me again.

01:33.721 --> 01:35.631
Please, call me back.

01:36.786 --> 01:39.041
We're family.

01:47.031 --> 01:49.582
Man on P.A.: <i>Good morning,
this is your captain speaking.</i>

01:49.607 --> 01:51.301
<i>- We've begun our descent...</i>
- (thud and gasps)

01:51.326 --> 01:52.955
<i>- into Los Angeles International Airport...</i>
- Man: Deedee? Hey.

01:52.980 --> 01:54.377
<i>- Where the current weather is a comfortable</i>
- Hey, Deedee?

01:54.402 --> 01:55.645
<i>68 degrees...</i>

01:55.646 --> 01:58.378
<i>- And the local time is 7:14...</i>
- Deedee? Deedee!

01:58.403 --> 01:59.466
<i>...Pacific Standard Time.</i>

01:59.467 --> 02:01.418
- What's going on?
- Oh, my God, oh, my God.

02:01.443 --> 02:03.436
- Is there a doctor onboard?
- Can I get some help?

02:03.461 --> 02:05.085
- Wake up, Deedee, come on.
- Help?

02:05.109 --> 02:06.549
- Oh, my God!
- Somebody help me!

02:06.574 --> 02:08.776
- I don't know what's going on.
- Somebody help us!

02:08.801 --> 02:10.401
- He's not breathing!
- Come on.

02:10.425 --> 02:13.373
- What's going on?
- He's not breathing!

02:13.399 --> 02:15.301
- He's dying!
- Hey, Miss?

02:15.325 --> 02:17.195
- Wake up!
- I need help!

02:17.220 --> 02:19.030
- Come on, wake up.
- Somebody?

We gotta stop.
I'm gonna be late for work again.

03:04.556 --> 03:06.715
You bust your butt for that company.

03:06.740 --> 03:08.171
They'll deal with it.

03:08.196 --> 03:11.666
Yeah, well,
those video games don't code themselves.

03:11.691 --> 03:13.484
These lips don't kiss themselves.

Ignore those texts,

how cheesy I can be.

03:21.276 --> 03:24.685
Oh, I'm... not quite
sure what that means,

03:24.710 --> 03:26.611
but I wish I could stick
around and find out.

03:26.636 --> 03:28.973
Oh, come on, it's not life or death.

03:28.998 --> 03:30.318
It's just a bunch of video games.

03:30.526 --> 03:32.938
I'm gonna be late to work.
I'm gonna be late opening up the shop,

03:32.963 --> 03:35.702
and I'm gonna risk the wrath
of a bunch of uber nerds

03:35.727 --> 03:37.068
to spend some more time with you.

03:37.092 --> 03:39.218
Believe me,
I'd rather spend more time with you,

03:39.243 --> 03:41.142
but my boss is intense, so...

03:41.167 --> 03:43.946
You're on-call, like, 24/7.
I mean, I get it.

03:44.667 --> 03:46.399
I just miss you.

03:49.043 --> 03:51.407
- Don't freak out.
- Hey, no, I'm not.

03:51.432 --> 03:53.325
Okay, look, I miss you too.

03:53.351 --> 03:55.101
Then go in late.

03:55.126 --> 03:56.871
Look, I'm sorry.

03:56.940 --> 03:59.555
Okay, I know it's weird,

03:59.580 --> 04:01.763
but I'm dedicated to my job.

04:02.436 --> 04:03.665
And to you.

04:03.690 --> 04:05.415
Okay. You're saying this,

04:05.440 --> 04:07.910
but I... I'm starting to think

04:07.935 --> 04:09.954
you don't really have
time for a relationship.

04:09.979 --> 04:12.242
Wha... Don't give up on me.

04:12.266 --> 04:13.800
Okay, look, hey, let's just...

04:13.825 --> 04:16.245
Let's do dinner tonight,

04:16.269 --> 04:18.119
and we'll talk about it, okay?

04:19.004 --> 04:21.913
- You promise?
- Yeah. Completely and totally.

04:21.938 --> 04:23.928
Okay.

04:28.688 --> 04:32.859
A plane from New York to Australia with
a scheduled stopover in Los Angeles

04:32.884 --> 04:35.843
landed this morning
with 12 dead passengers.

04:35.868 --> 04:36.717
Cause of death?

04:36.742 --> 04:39.253
ME's preliminary findings
list heart attack.

04:39.278 --> 04:41.134
12 heart attacks on the same plane?

04:41.159 --> 04:43.077
Media's having a field day with this.

04:43.102 --> 04:45.884
Homeland Security, LAPD,
and CDC are all scrambling.

04:45.909 --> 04:47.877
A hazmat team swept the
plane and it was clean.

04:47.902 --> 04:49.588
Same goes for the
passengers and the victims.

04:49.613 --> 04:52.700
Blair believes our program can offer
a unique perspective on the case.

04:52.725 --> 04:55.102
So we've received special dispensation

04:55.127 --> 04:57.472
to run point and have
first crack at the bodies.

04:57.497 --> 04:59.203
Before the media circus
goes off the rails,

04:59.228 --> 05:00.741
we need to figure out
how these people died.

05:00.766 --> 05:03.715
Or were killed. It's possible the
heart attacks were chemically induced.

05:03.740 --> 05:04.972
Checked and ruled out.

05:04.997 --> 05:06.769
Any connections between
the 12 passengers?

05:06.794 --> 05:07.843
None. All strangers

05:07.868 --> 05:09.244
seated in different parts of the plane.

05:09.269 --> 05:12.048
It's very freaky.
Where are the surviving passengers now?

05:12.073 --> 05:13.070
Detained.

05:13.096 --> 05:15.694
The authorities can hold
the passengers for 24 hours

05:15.719 --> 05:17.644
before either pressing
charges or letting them go.

05:17.669 --> 05:19.226
We have until tomorrow
morning at 8:00 a.m.

05:19.251 --> 05:20.840
Or it's possible the killer walks free.

05:20.865 --> 05:23.662
I'm sorry, can I just play
Captain Obvious for like a sec?

05:23.687 --> 05:25.278
We have 12 victims.

05:25.303 --> 05:29.483
There's no way we can stitch
into all 12 in 24 hours.

05:29.508 --> 05:31.225
Okay, so how many can we stitch into?

05:31.250 --> 05:32.953
If we don't take any
breaks, we can do six.

05:32.978 --> 05:35.774
But which six? By the time we background
check them all, time will be up.

05:35.799 --> 05:37.992
- Has to be random.
- Okay, hold up, slow down.

05:38.016 --> 05:39.405
I understand the urgency,

05:39.431 --> 05:41.154
but just because it is
technically possible

05:41.179 --> 05:43.248
to stitch into six victims in one day,

05:43.273 --> 05:44.567
does not mean Stretch
here can handle it.

05:44.592 --> 05:47.128
What is that?
Reverse psychology to get me motivated?

05:47.153 --> 05:49.882
No, it's legitimate concern for
your mental and physical health.

05:49.907 --> 05:51.206
Cameron is right.

05:51.231 --> 05:54.376
12 people don't just die.
If there's a cause, a killer,

05:54.402 --> 05:56.528
this is the only way of finding out.

05:56.737 --> 05:58.266
I can do this.

05:58.291 --> 06:00.211
Any sign that it's too much,

06:00.236 --> 06:02.525
- we pull the plug.
- Agreed.

06:02.550 --> 06:04.408
Well, you heard the
lady, let's get going.

06:04.433 --> 06:06.136
It's gonna be a long day.

06:11.008 --> 06:12.957
So, when can you hand off Liam to me?

06:12.982 --> 06:15.651
Seriously? You have six stitches today.

06:15.676 --> 06:17.804
How 'bout we get through that
and figure it out tomorrow?

06:17.829 --> 06:20.371
Or, how 'bout we get through today?

06:20.935 --> 06:23.084
Are you sure you want to do this?

06:23.109 --> 06:25.129
You guys have major history.

06:25.154 --> 06:27.659
Your old feelings for
him could get in the way.

06:27.684 --> 06:30.533
It was the old me that dated Liam,
I didn't have feelings for him.

06:30.558 --> 06:33.202
At least, you know, not in the
way I understand feelings now.

06:33.227 --> 06:34.778
Oh, Kirsten, I'm not talking about love.

06:34.802 --> 06:37.162
This guy's connected to your
dad and was playing you.

06:37.188 --> 06:39.041
I'm talking about revenge.

06:39.909 --> 06:41.857
I can handle it.

06:44.703 --> 06:48.829
_

06:51.533 --> 06:55.376
Well, if we ever wanted to push the
envelope of the program, this should do it.

06:55.401 --> 06:58.240
What do you think? We
can do this, right?

06:58.265 --> 06:59.916
Dr. Goodkin?

07:00.103 --> 07:02.389
"Dr. Goodkin."

07:02.538 --> 07:06.977
You going all formal on me doesn't
help my confidence, Detective Fisher.

07:08.428 --> 07:12.201
There is some logic to stitching
into six victims consecutively.

07:12.226 --> 07:13.821
Should give Kirsten enough
different perspective

07:13.846 --> 07:15.263
of what went on inside that plane.

07:15.288 --> 07:18.187
That is if we picked
the right six victims.

07:18.212 --> 07:20.535
Six out of 12, 50/50 chance.

07:20.560 --> 07:23.498
A Vegas slot machine had those odds
there'd be a line around the block.

07:23.523 --> 07:25.180
Never been much of a gambler.

07:25.473 --> 07:27.949
- Sub-bio?
- Alex: Go.

07:28.094 --> 07:30.013
- Communications?
- Go.

07:30.038 --> 07:31.077
- Medical?
- Go.

07:31.102 --> 07:32.845
Comm check, Kirsten, one-two, one-two.

07:32.870 --> 07:34.499
I'm here all day, folks.

07:34.524 --> 07:36.056
Mission clock set to
five minutes, please.

07:36.081 --> 07:39.995
Induce stitch neurosync on
my mark in three, two...

07:40.163 --> 07:44.458
May the odds be ever in our favor...
one, mark!

07:49.753 --> 07:51.974
- I'm on board.
- Where?

07:55.604 --> 07:57.340
Uh, in the back.

07:57.365 --> 07:58.863
Seat 12D.

07:59.014 --> 08:01.716
There's a flight attendant in the aisle.

08:01.741 --> 08:04.219
- Deedee.
- Checking the manifest.

08:04.288 --> 08:06.282
Deedee Willis, she's a victim.

08:06.307 --> 08:07.744
Did we pick her for stitching?

08:07.769 --> 08:09.370
She's being mapped right now.

08:09.395 --> 08:11.374
Sir, please make sure your...

08:11.399 --> 08:14.190
How are the other passengers?
Anyone seem sick?

08:14.215 --> 08:16.090
- Or dead?
- Or worse?

08:18.038 --> 08:21.065
Uh, the woman in 12C isn't moving.

08:21.154 --> 08:22.986
She's a victim but not a sample.

08:23.011 --> 08:26.159
Her name is April Tuckman,
traveling with her husband, Howard.

08:28.141 --> 08:31.652
She's still alive, she's just sleeping.

08:31.683 --> 08:34.544
Uh, there's a guy in
the middle of the plane,

08:34.568 --> 08:36.375
he's got the overhead compartment open.

08:36.400 --> 08:37.975
He's looking for something.

08:48.916 --> 08:51.208
Victim number one is on the move.

08:53.142 --> 08:55.981
Suspicious looking lady in 10D.

08:56.619 --> 08:58.385
Suspicious how?

08:58.409 --> 09:00.211
She's working on a laptop,

09:00.236 --> 09:02.572
and she didn't want victim one
seeing it as she walked past.

09:02.598 --> 09:05.035
Laptop lady in 10D is not a victim,

09:05.060 --> 09:07.686
but the guy next to her in 10E is,
Gavin Baxter,

09:07.711 --> 09:09.435
who's also one of our upcoming stitches.

09:09.460 --> 09:10.994
Victim number one's back in her seat.

09:13.984 --> 09:15.360
Death moment in five seconds.

09:15.385 --> 09:17.356
Kirsten, bounce in four, three...

09:17.381 --> 09:18.898
<i>(over P.A.) Good morning,
this is your captain speaking.</i>

09:18.923 --> 09:22.219
<i>We are making our final
descent into Los Ang...</i>

09:22.244 --> 09:23.732
(beeping)

09:30.713 --> 09:33.306
Victim number one just... died.

09:33.331 --> 09:36.693
There was no warning. It was like
someone flipped off a light switch.

09:36.718 --> 09:38.260
Did you see anything unusual?

09:38.285 --> 09:41.224
I don't know. I saw lots of pieces,

09:41.249 --> 09:45.141
but I have no idea how or why
or if they all fit together.

09:45.166 --> 09:47.581
Well, we've got just under
19 hours to figure that out.

09:47.605 --> 09:49.395
How soon can we go again?

09:54.066 --> 09:56.369
I've already left three messages.

09:56.394 --> 09:59.127
All right, please,
just have him call me back.

10:00.190 --> 10:03.378
Hey, I've been trying to get ahold of
my dad's doctor for the last two days.

10:03.402 --> 10:05.229
- Who is it?
- Preminger.

10:05.254 --> 10:07.667
Well, he's the best
orthopedic oncologist in LA.

10:07.692 --> 10:09.207
I'd keep trying.

10:13.537 --> 10:16.350
Son of a bitch.

10:19.612 --> 10:21.747
Cameron: That's Deedee Willis,
she was a flight attendant on board.

10:21.772 --> 10:23.254
_

10:23.279 --> 10:25.391
If anyone saw the entire flight and
all of its passengers, it's her.

10:25.416 --> 10:26.747
How are you?

10:26.772 --> 10:29.720
Just because you're a doctor does
not mean that you are my doctor.

10:29.745 --> 10:32.236
- (scoffs)
- But I am fine, thank you.

10:32.262 --> 10:33.860
- Okay.
- How are you?

10:33.885 --> 10:35.475
I feel like I never see you anymore.

10:35.501 --> 10:36.676
I mean, outside of work.

10:36.701 --> 10:38.590
You know, it... I...

10:38.615 --> 10:40.597
You have Nina in your life, I get it.

10:40.622 --> 10:45.012
Really, I'm just saying that
I miss hanging out with you.

10:46.436 --> 10:47.722
I'll tell you what,

10:47.747 --> 10:49.544
we get through these next 17 hours,

10:49.569 --> 10:54.288
and then the three of us will,
uh, do drinks or something, okay?

10:54.313 --> 10:55.603
She's crazy about you.

10:55.628 --> 10:59.952
Oh, yeah, that sounds, uh...
That sounds really nice.

10:59.976 --> 11:03.421
I think so too.

11:10.670 --> 11:12.559
Comm check, Kirsten, one-two, one-two.

11:12.584 --> 11:13.538
Loud and clear.

11:13.563 --> 11:16.156
Mission clock set to
five minutes, please.

11:16.181 --> 11:23.344
Induce stitch neurosync on my
mark in three, two, one, mark.

11:26.486 --> 11:28.403
If you're tired, you should take a nap.

11:28.428 --> 11:29.935
It's too cold to sleep.

11:37.780 --> 11:39.527
- Better?
- Mm-hmm.

11:39.552 --> 11:42.809
Howard Tuckman just put his jacket
on his wife to use as a blanket.

11:47.132 --> 11:49.570
Laptop lady's doing some
pretty high-level math.

11:49.595 --> 11:50.915
Cameron: Any idea what?

11:50.940 --> 11:53.112
I only saw a bit of it
before Deedee moved on.

11:56.642 --> 11:59.374
Sir, please make sure your
watch is on airplane mode.

11:59.399 --> 12:02.581
I'm just setting it
for Los Angeles time.

12:02.840 --> 12:06.623
There's a man in 7C. He has a
smartwatch. He's setting it for LA time.

12:06.648 --> 12:08.753
His name is Jay Kolden, not a victim.

12:09.344 --> 12:11.424
Okay. Thank you.

12:22.019 --> 12:23.543
What was that about?

12:23.568 --> 12:25.652
Can't find his passport.

12:27.066 --> 12:29.479
What was that?

12:30.450 --> 12:32.191
Death moment in five seconds.

12:32.216 --> 12:34.375
Kirsten, bounce in four, three...

12:34.400 --> 12:36.547
<i>Good morning, this is
your captain speaking.</i>

12:36.572 --> 12:39.619
<i>We are making our final
descent into Los Ang...</i>

12:39.644 --> 12:40.644
(beeping)

12:45.539 --> 12:50.286
Deedee's memory ended at exactly the same
moment during the captain's announcement.

12:50.311 --> 12:52.330
Did you see anything in the
run-up to the moment of death?

12:52.355 --> 12:56.218
Uh, that the lights flickered and
the captain made an announcement.

12:56.243 --> 12:58.823
Well, the lights and the PA system
are both electrical in nature.

12:58.848 --> 13:01.840
I can go check out the plane.
I just need a simple EMI detector.

13:01.865 --> 13:03.763
Okay. We have a little time
before the next stitch.

13:03.788 --> 13:05.482
Grab two and get over
there with Camille.

13:05.507 --> 13:07.566
- Roger that.
- What's our vector, Victor?

13:07.591 --> 13:09.660
That literally means nothing to me.

13:09.685 --> 13:10.694
<i>Airplane!</i>

13:10.719 --> 13:11.922
You're learning.

13:14.338 --> 13:16.109
You okay, champ?

13:16.134 --> 13:17.511
I'm good.

13:17.536 --> 13:21.319
Okay. You make sure and let
me know if anything changes.

13:21.344 --> 13:23.398
You will be the second to know.

13:30.588 --> 13:32.068
(detectors beeping)

13:32.522 --> 13:34.551
Hey, did you, um...

13:34.576 --> 13:37.244
You ever connect with your dad's doctor?

13:37.989 --> 13:41.409
No. It's like trying to
nail jelly to a wall.

13:41.434 --> 13:44.313
He has so many patients my
dad is just another number.

13:44.338 --> 13:46.735
Well, he's really lucky he
has an advocate like you.

13:46.760 --> 13:47.964
How's he doing?

13:47.989 --> 13:50.814
He's trying to be brave,
but I know he's afraid.

13:50.839 --> 13:54.052
So is my mother. So am I.

13:54.078 --> 13:56.873
Is there anything I can do to help?

13:56.898 --> 13:58.041
(phone ringing)

13:58.307 --> 14:00.549
Oh, no, no, don't... I got it. It got.

14:03.246 --> 14:06.781
Liam. That Liam?

14:06.806 --> 14:08.777
Is he the reason you
weren't at the library?

14:09.115 --> 14:11.184
Yeah. You wanna know why?

14:11.209 --> 14:13.823
Because he's connected
to Daniel Stinger.

14:13.848 --> 14:17.296
And Maggie wanted me to find out
what information I could get on him.

14:18.013 --> 14:19.533
I suppose she didn't
want you telling me.

14:19.558 --> 14:21.310
No, I wasn't allowed to tell anyone.

14:21.335 --> 14:24.032
So, I didn't. I did my job.

14:29.760 --> 14:31.720
I believe you.

14:35.113 --> 14:37.251
Thanks.

14:45.323 --> 14:47.213
(phone beeps)

14:51.026 --> 14:52.905
- Hey.
- Oh, sorry.

14:52.930 --> 14:54.344
Nina?

14:54.496 --> 14:56.325
Yeah. How'd you know?

14:56.350 --> 14:58.309
Smile gave you away.

14:58.468 --> 15:00.373
We were supposed
to have dinner tonight, but...

15:00.398 --> 15:01.133
Mmm.

15:01.158 --> 15:02.287
Sorry you had to cancel.

15:02.312 --> 15:05.585
Oh, you never know. I mean, we could
solve the case in the next stitch.

15:05.610 --> 15:06.931
The aspirin you asked for.

15:06.956 --> 15:08.736
Thanks.

15:08.761 --> 15:10.260
Aspirin?

15:10.285 --> 15:12.919
Yeah, relax. It's just a headache.
I'll be fine.

15:15.462 --> 15:17.267
Okay.

15:18.291 --> 15:23.124
_

15:23.149 --> 15:24.585
Third stitch is the charm?

15:24.610 --> 15:25.755
Let's hope so.

15:25.780 --> 15:28.991
There was no residual electricity
in the cabin. Readings were clear.

15:29.015 --> 15:30.144
We've checked and double-checked it.

15:30.169 --> 15:32.858
There's absolutely nothing that
connects one victim to another.

15:32.883 --> 15:34.372
Where are we on personal possessions?

15:34.397 --> 15:36.316
Everything the victims
had on them when they died

15:36.341 --> 15:38.701
- is on its way to the lab for examination.
- (phone chimes)

15:39.074 --> 15:40.716
Blair again?

15:40.741 --> 15:43.349
The man is relentless.
We have to make some progress.

15:43.374 --> 15:45.019
Liam: <i>Hello, stranger.</i>

15:45.045 --> 15:46.865
<i>I was starting to think
you were avoiding me.</i>

15:46.889 --> 15:51.505
Yeah, uh, about that,
you weren't imagining.

15:51.530 --> 15:53.884
Camile, what's up? Is
this about Kirsten?

15:53.909 --> 15:54.719
You know what?

15:54.744 --> 15:59.232
It turns out she's not as completely
over you as I originally thought.

15:59.257 --> 16:00.174
Really?

16:00.199 --> 16:02.372
<i>Yeah, you know, I guess
seeing us together</i>

16:02.397 --> 16:07.166
made her realize how
much she... missed you.

16:07.191 --> 16:11.050
And if there's any chance you two
could repair your relationship,

16:11.075 --> 16:15.632
I wouldn't feel right
standing in the way.

16:15.656 --> 16:19.665
I'd be lying if I said I wasn't a
bit intrigued by the possibility.

16:19.690 --> 16:23.105
Okay. Well, I'll have her reach out.

16:23.131 --> 16:26.403
<i>You really are a selfless friend.
She's lucky to have you.</i>

16:26.428 --> 16:28.556
And I'll tell her as
much when I see her.

16:36.037 --> 16:40.375
(cell camera clicking)

16:45.103 --> 16:47.861
Mission clock set to
five minutes, please.

16:47.886 --> 16:54.426
Induce stitch neurosync on my
mark in three, two, one, mark.

16:56.230 --> 16:57.579
(hip-hop music playing)

16:57.604 --> 16:58.816
Cameron: <i>Where are you, Captain?</i>

16:58.849 --> 17:01.451

17:43.490 --> 17:44.490
(beeping)

17:49.043 --> 17:50.706
Death moment?

17:50.731 --> 17:52.286
Same as the others.

17:52.311 --> 17:54.373
Did you see what she was working on?

17:54.398 --> 17:55.942
Quantum computing.

17:55.967 --> 17:58.316
There are five quantum
computers in the world.

17:58.341 --> 18:01.134
The Department of Defense has one,
the company that makes them has one,

18:01.159 --> 18:02.735
NASA has one, and we have one.

18:02.760 --> 18:04.333
- Where's number five?
- Unknown.

18:04.358 --> 18:06.945
Is it Stitchers related?
We've been targeted before.

18:06.970 --> 18:08.242
What seat is she in?

18:08.267 --> 18:09.893
10D.

18:09.918 --> 18:11.711
Tracy Green.

18:12.685 --> 18:14.908
Congratulations, Tracy Green,

18:14.933 --> 18:17.291
you just made it to the top of the list.

18:18.082 --> 18:20.449
What was the purpose of
your trip to Los Angeles?

18:20.474 --> 18:22.139
Business.

18:22.164 --> 18:24.138
Could you be any more vague?

18:24.163 --> 18:27.911
I'm not the one dragging traumatized
passengers to interrogation rooms

18:27.936 --> 18:29.108
in windowless vans.

18:29.132 --> 18:32.150
Ma'am, we're just trying to determine
what happened on that plane.

18:32.176 --> 18:33.842
What sort of business are you in?

18:33.866 --> 18:36.508
I'm here to meet with some
of our component suppliers.

18:36.533 --> 18:40.307
I work for a company that designs
tech for quantum computers.

18:40.332 --> 18:43.311
Not like either one of you two muscleheads
would know anything about them.

18:43.336 --> 18:45.249
(whispers) She called me a musclehead.

18:45.356 --> 18:47.090
And what is your
position at the company?

18:47.115 --> 18:50.342
I specialize in adiabatic
quantum computation.

18:50.367 --> 18:52.554
- Basically, what that means...
- I know what it means.

18:52.930 --> 18:55.295
You're familiar with
the adiabatic model?

18:55.320 --> 18:57.064
Yeah.

18:57.089 --> 19:00.048
Can I see the laptop you
used during the flight?

19:01.535 --> 19:05.581
Good luck.
Crapped out right before we landed.

19:06.140 --> 19:08.154
It's toast.

19:10.422 --> 19:13.639
(keys clicking)

19:14.799 --> 19:16.828
Thank you for your time, Ms. Green.

19:16.866 --> 19:20.026
Once we've verified things with your
employer, we'll have you taken back to LAX.

19:21.706 --> 19:26.299
You know, just out of curiosity, what would
one of your quantum computers set me back?

19:26.324 --> 19:29.940
If you have to ask, you can't afford it.

19:30.780 --> 19:33.043
Okay.

19:36.726 --> 19:39.317
I doubt she knows anything
about the Stitchers program.

19:39.342 --> 19:41.470
I doubt she knows anything
about quantum computation.

19:41.495 --> 19:44.182
I mastered the adiabatic
model in fifth grade.

19:49.968 --> 19:51.570
If there's a pattern
here, I don't see it.

19:51.595 --> 19:53.949
We have 11 toothbrushes,
nine sets of earbuds,

19:53.974 --> 19:58.135
five neck pillows, one borderline
pornographic romance novel...

19:59.036 --> 20:00.999
Anything here stand
out from the stitches?

20:01.661 --> 20:05.011
Nothing that makes any sense, no.

20:05.761 --> 20:08.195
Okay, we've got 45 minutes
until your next stitch.

20:08.220 --> 20:09.576
I insist that you get off your feet,
all right?

20:09.601 --> 20:11.405
- We'll keep sorting.
- No, I can handle it.

20:11.430 --> 20:13.529
Hey, no, no, Kirsten, please.

20:13.554 --> 20:17.211
Look, you're no good to us burnt out,
all right?

20:17.236 --> 20:20.522
We got this. Sit.

20:22.876 --> 20:24.649
Good stitcher.

20:35.789 --> 20:39.478
Wait, here's something. None of the victims
were scheduled to remain in Los Angeles.

20:39.503 --> 20:40.877
They were all traveling on to Sydney.

20:40.902 --> 20:42.919
Were they the only passengers
going on to Australia?

20:42.944 --> 20:44.637
No, but that doesn't negate the pattern.

20:44.662 --> 20:46.243
Final destination as a cause of death?

20:46.268 --> 20:49.282
They were all traveling internationally,
they all had passports.

20:51.451 --> 20:53.243
Nope.

20:53.268 --> 20:55.860
(phone ringing)

20:59.984 --> 21:01.839
Hello?

21:03.712 --> 21:05.263
Kirsten?

21:05.580 --> 21:07.821
Nina, hi.

21:07.849 --> 21:10.162
Um, is Cameron there?

21:14.782 --> 21:16.812
<i>Kirsten, are you there?</i>

21:17.839 --> 21:19.235
Sorry.

21:19.260 --> 21:24.029
Um, uh, Cameron's kinda busy right now.

21:24.054 --> 21:26.286
Um, do you know when he's gonna be off?

21:26.311 --> 21:29.732
No, it's been a crazy day,
so I'm not really sure.

21:29.757 --> 21:31.205
<i>You want me to leave him a message?</i>

21:31.230 --> 21:33.906
No, I've got it. Thanks.

21:47.795 --> 21:50.164
(computer beeping)

21:51.512 --> 21:53.654
<i>Why are you calling me from your office?</i>

21:53.679 --> 21:55.801
<i>I'm sure you have things
you need to be working on.</i>

21:55.826 --> 21:59.381
I just wanted to check in
and see how you were doing.

22:02.443 --> 22:05.673
<i>My test results came back.</i>

22:05.698 --> 22:08.169
<i>They are not what we
had hoped for, Linus.</i>

22:09.050 --> 22:11.247
<i>But you know that already.</i>

22:11.272 --> 22:16.290
<i>I got a call from the doctor tonight.
12 messages, Linus?</i>

22:16.414 --> 22:20.165
Baba, he doesn't talk to me.
What else am I supposed to do?

22:20.190 --> 22:22.357
I can't help you if I
don't know what's going on.

22:22.381 --> 22:26.025
<i>I'm a grown man, Linus.
I can take care of myself.</i>

22:26.430 --> 22:29.294
I know that. But I want to help.

22:29.433 --> 22:32.527
I'll come by later today and we can talk
through all of the treatment options.

22:32.552 --> 22:37.133
<i>No, no. You're at work.</i>

22:37.158 --> 22:40.727
<i>You have responsibilities.
You need to live your life.</i>

22:40.751 --> 22:43.416
<i>Worry about the things you can control.</i>

22:43.441 --> 22:45.339
Why are you making goodbye speeches?

22:45.364 --> 22:48.333
You're gonna be fine.
People beat this every day.

22:49.151 --> 22:53.499
<i>Even more reason you
should stay at the office.</i>

22:59.868 --> 23:01.898
Hey.

23:02.531 --> 23:05.679
Listen, what do you say when
this is all over, you and I...

23:05.704 --> 23:08.203
My dad is worse than I thought.

23:08.228 --> 23:10.955
Okay. What can I do?

23:10.980 --> 23:14.484
I just need more time.
We are moving so fast,

23:14.509 --> 23:16.766
I just want to go over a few
calculations before we start.

23:16.791 --> 23:19.369
- Linus...
- I just need to do my job.

23:19.393 --> 23:22.876
It's okay. There's nothing I
can do to help cure my dad.

23:22.901 --> 23:27.780
But this?
This is a problem I know how to solve.

23:28.708 --> 23:31.958
Really. It's gonna be okay.

23:44.651 --> 23:48.118
This is the guy who was looking
for something in the overhead bin.

23:48.143 --> 23:49.423
- Mike?
- Matt Calter.

23:49.424 --> 23:51.026
_

23:51.051 --> 23:53.756
Australian commodities broker.
How you holding up, cupcake?

23:53.781 --> 23:55.486
Yeah, all right. Never better.

23:55.510 --> 23:57.159
Heh. Liar.

23:57.184 --> 24:01.203
Hey, keep an eye out for anything relating
to those victims' passports, okay?

24:01.228 --> 24:02.494
Might be the key.

24:02.519 --> 24:06.118
I don't like this. BP is dropping.

24:06.222 --> 24:07.596
- Should we bounce her?
- No!

24:07.621 --> 24:09.880
Do not bounce me.

24:15.403 --> 24:17.689
Sir, please make sure your
watch is on airplane mode.

24:17.714 --> 24:20.504
It is. I'm just setting
it for Los Angeles time.

24:20.529 --> 24:22.693
Okay, thank you.

24:25.472 --> 24:27.661
Babe, if you're tired,
you should take a nap.

24:27.686 --> 24:30.051
It's too cold to sleep.

24:37.042 --> 24:39.521
I'm sorry, but you
need to sit back down.

24:39.546 --> 24:40.931
I'm just looking for my passport.

24:40.956 --> 24:44.390
I understand, but you'll have to look
for it after we're on the ground.

24:46.052 --> 24:50.066
Okay, Matt's passport's missing. It
couldn't have been connected to his death.

24:54.240 --> 24:56.668
Lucky I found this.

24:58.912 --> 25:00.625
Death moment in five seconds.

25:00.650 --> 25:03.123
Kirsten, bounce in four, three...

25:03.148 --> 25:05.440
<i>Good morning, this is
your captain speaking.</i>

25:05.465 --> 25:08.364
<i>We are making our final
descent into Los Ang...</i>

25:08.389 --> 25:09.389
(beeping)

25:14.919 --> 25:18.061
I was wrong. Matt did have his passport,

25:18.086 --> 25:21.790
and he had it in the pocket
next to his heart when he died.

25:30.536 --> 25:33.505
Dammit, I don't even know
what we're looking for.

25:33.530 --> 25:35.848
There is nothing unusual
about any of these.

25:35.873 --> 25:39.131
Maybe that's the point.
I mean, unusual would stand out.

25:39.484 --> 25:42.322
Something ordinary could be a clue?

25:42.347 --> 25:46.721
Okay. Um, standard stitching and paper,

25:46.914 --> 25:50.123
a page for a signature and data,
machine-readable zone...

25:50.148 --> 25:52.157
Fishy, knife.

25:53.244 --> 25:54.609
Don't hurt yourself.

25:54.634 --> 25:57.999
Oh, I'll try not to.

26:06.270 --> 26:09.679
All passports have radio
frequency chips embedded in them.

26:09.703 --> 26:11.084
Could that be something?

26:11.110 --> 26:14.935
RFID chips just store information,
that's it.

26:18.587 --> 26:21.099
(alarm sounding)

26:23.595 --> 26:26.882
- Knife.
- No, when I'm ready.

26:30.351 --> 26:32.393
Hey, is she okay?

26:33.262 --> 26:35.013
Her headache's gone,

26:35.038 --> 26:37.252
and I gave her a shot
of B-12 and glucose

26:37.277 --> 26:38.977
to help with the fatigue
and low blood-sugar,

26:39.002 --> 26:41.196
but we have to make sure she
eats between the stitches.

26:41.221 --> 26:42.395
Ayo, is she okay?

26:42.420 --> 26:46.660
Look, she's doing something no one's
ever done before. I don't know.

26:51.767 --> 26:55.902
Alex, how quickly can we switch
out samples in the corpse cassette?

26:55.927 --> 26:57.100
Go from one to the other?

26:57.125 --> 26:58.697
Yeah. Without Kirsten having to bounce.

26:58.722 --> 27:00.915
Hot swapping?

27:01.039 --> 27:04.700
Should be possible. As long as the
next subject's memory is mapped out.

27:05.029 --> 27:06.635
Minute. Minute and a half, tops.

27:06.660 --> 27:09.982
Good. Get victim number six cued up,
I'll coordinate with Linus.

27:14.502 --> 27:17.502
_

27:18.833 --> 27:22.741
Listen up, boys and girls, we're going to
try something new. Kirsten's burning out.

27:22.766 --> 27:24.177
Cameron, I'm fine.

27:24.202 --> 27:27.189
You're burning out. So in order for
her to get through this in one piece,

27:27.214 --> 27:30.279
she's gonna stitch in for two minutes
before moving on to the next subject.

27:30.304 --> 27:33.348
But every time Kirsten
bounces we have to reset?

27:33.373 --> 27:35.668
- That's why she's not gonna bounce.
- Really?

27:35.693 --> 27:37.880
We're gonna move your awareness
to stasis for one minute

27:37.905 --> 27:40.345
while we switch out victim number
five for victim number six.

27:40.371 --> 27:41.906
One stitch, two samples.

27:41.930 --> 27:44.892
That'll spare Kirsten, and the rest of
us, from having to make an extra stitch

27:44.917 --> 27:46.793
that she may or may not recover from.

27:46.818 --> 27:49.212
Is two minutes enough time to
get anything out of a stitch?

27:49.237 --> 27:51.730
It'll have to be. Lights at 20%, please.

27:51.755 --> 27:54.472
Mission clock set to
two minutes, please.

27:54.498 --> 27:57.671
All right, Kirsten, when you're in there,
you won't have much time to explore, so...

27:57.696 --> 27:59.579
Strictly smash and grab job. Got it.

27:59.604 --> 28:01.714
Thank you, Cameron.

28:01.738 --> 28:03.197
Of course.

28:03.222 --> 28:07.541
Induce first stitch neurosync on my mark

28:07.566 --> 28:12.396
in three, two, one, mark.

28:18.275 --> 28:21.134
Sir, please make sure your
watch is on airplane mode.

28:21.247 --> 28:23.910
It is. I'm just setting
it for Los Angeles time.

28:23.935 --> 28:25.819
Thank you.

28:25.892 --> 28:27.636
Dude, can I squeeze past you?

28:27.661 --> 28:30.413
Sure.

28:51.795 --> 28:54.279
Nervous guy writing a letter.

28:54.304 --> 28:57.946
Death moment. Going offline... now!

28:57.971 --> 29:02.027
Okay, Kirsten, we're
moving you to stasis.

29:04.529 --> 29:08.097
All right, let's switch her out,
let's go, let's go! Kirsten, one minute.

29:08.123 --> 29:11.832
Okay. Please, hurry.

29:12.960 --> 29:17.107
(chattering)

29:17.132 --> 29:18.685
Ready to move.

29:18.710 --> 29:19.729
BP starting to escalate.

29:19.754 --> 29:20.763
Move sample.

29:20.788 --> 29:23.284
(breathing heavily)

29:27.263 --> 29:29.777
Need some help over here!

29:29.802 --> 29:31.591
She needs to slow down her breathing.

29:31.616 --> 29:32.989
All right, Kirsten,
you're doing great, all right?

29:33.014 --> 29:34.780
Just slow down your breathing,
we're almost done here.

29:34.805 --> 29:37.561
Cameron, I'm in a void.

29:37.902 --> 29:41.469
Um... I'm nowhere.

29:41.898 --> 29:43.999
I'm nothing.

29:44.940 --> 29:46.949
I'm all alone.

29:47.228 --> 29:51.425
No. Not alone.

29:53.812 --> 29:55.611
Who are you?

29:55.636 --> 29:58.288
You look so tired, so scared.

29:58.313 --> 29:59.700
Kirsten: <i>I am.</i>

29:59.725 --> 30:03.916
Don't worry. I'll stay with you.

30:03.941 --> 30:06.310
Stay with me, Kirsten.

30:06.336 --> 30:07.838
Hooking up neural transmitter.

30:07.863 --> 30:09.487
Must move faster, boys.

30:09.512 --> 30:10.868
- Get the harness.
- Okay, on my go.

30:10.892 --> 30:12.483
Get it up.

30:13.668 --> 30:15.765
Coming up on 30 seconds.

30:16.658 --> 30:19.339
I've been watching you stitch
into all those poor people.

30:19.364 --> 30:21.778
You've got the right idea,
but you're going about it wrong.

30:21.803 --> 30:22.699
What do you mean?

30:22.724 --> 30:25.675
You need to see all of the victims'
memories at the same time

30:25.700 --> 30:27.625
if you want to see all
the pieces of the puzzle.

30:27.650 --> 30:30.393
But we can only stitch
into one person at a time.

30:31.338 --> 30:33.197
Not true.

30:33.222 --> 30:36.069
I'm gonna show you something. Ready?

30:44.164 --> 30:48.529
Recognize that?
I picked it from your memory.

30:48.733 --> 30:53.439
I remember.
My mother made that daisy chain for me.

30:53.465 --> 30:58.217
It's also the answer you need to stitching
into multiple people at the same time.

31:00.945 --> 31:02.694
We got it. Okay, go ahead.

31:02.719 --> 31:03.511
We're good to go.

31:03.536 --> 31:05.318
You're doing great, Kirsten.
You're doing great.

31:05.343 --> 31:08.244
Induce second stitch neurosync
on my mark in three...

31:08.269 --> 31:09.074
Thank you.

31:09.099 --> 31:11.409
- Two, one...
- You're welcome.

31:11.434 --> 31:12.434
Mark.

31:16.585 --> 31:19.686
Cameron: Two minutes.
Plenty of time, Kirsten.

31:21.051 --> 31:23.285
I won't need it.

31:26.081 --> 31:29.181
There's nothing here to see.

31:33.699 --> 31:35.668
I'm sorry, I...

31:35.749 --> 31:39.527
I was so tired I didn't
map this memory properly.

31:39.552 --> 31:41.703
So it's a wasted stitch.

31:41.728 --> 31:44.339
Dammit, Kirsten, just make the bounce.

31:46.895 --> 31:48.664
I'm sorry.

31:49.072 --> 31:51.879
It's not his fault, Cameron.
We're all running on fumes here.

31:51.904 --> 31:54.349
I know. I'm just frustrated.

31:59.814 --> 32:02.527
Wait, there's one thing...

32:02.806 --> 32:05.821
One thing that we haven't tried.

32:05.866 --> 32:07.901
- Get her out of there!
- Kirsten!

32:07.926 --> 32:10.428
- Somebody get the team in here!
- Get that Med cart! Go!

32:26.290 --> 32:28.109
What happened?

32:28.134 --> 32:29.223
You passed out in the tank.

32:29.583 --> 32:32.347
Pulse ox is 93. Almost back to normal.

32:32.372 --> 32:33.372
How do you feel?

32:33.642 --> 32:36.220
Surprisingly refreshed.

32:36.245 --> 32:37.665
How do you really feel?

32:37.690 --> 32:39.816
- I'm fine.
- And we're gonna keep you that way.

32:39.841 --> 32:42.060
- Okay, we're done.
- No, what? We can't be.

32:42.085 --> 32:45.798
There's less than three hours left. This
was a nearly impossible task to begin with.

32:45.823 --> 32:47.812
We'll keep at it with the
evidence we've already gathered.

32:47.837 --> 32:49.856
No, that's not enough.

32:49.881 --> 32:51.369
The killer will walk free.

32:51.394 --> 32:53.410
We have to do one more stitch.

32:53.435 --> 32:56.195
All five victims with viable
memories at the same time.

32:56.320 --> 32:58.822
You are disoriented from passing out.

32:58.847 --> 33:01.831
No. No, I need to see the entire
passenger section of the plane

33:01.856 --> 33:03.369
from all perspectives at once.

33:03.394 --> 33:05.254
- Can we even do that?
- In theory,

33:05.279 --> 33:06.504
but I don't know how.

33:06.530 --> 33:09.517
We daisy chain the subjects.

33:10.988 --> 33:13.481
We arrange four of them
around the corpse cassette,

33:13.506 --> 33:15.998
and have them all interconnected
to the subject inside.

33:16.022 --> 33:19.676
Interesting. What gave you that idea?

33:19.701 --> 33:21.994
Just popped into my head.

33:22.019 --> 33:24.606
We could use the optogenetics
harnesses from the university.

33:24.631 --> 33:26.559
That could work.

33:26.584 --> 33:30.519
Hold on. Is it safe to send her into
the memories of five victims at once?

33:30.544 --> 33:32.255
On a normal day, maybe,

33:32.281 --> 33:34.120
but I don't know.
I mean, we are on the edge of the map.

33:34.144 --> 33:35.477
We need to be sure.

33:35.502 --> 33:37.094
Guys...

33:38.834 --> 33:41.498
12 people are dead, okay?

33:41.523 --> 33:43.925
And the killer is waiting to
hop on a plane to Australia.

33:43.950 --> 33:47.233
We can't just let him or
her fly off into the sunset.

33:49.164 --> 33:51.394
Get the harnesses.

34:04.281 --> 34:06.016
I hate grape.

34:06.041 --> 34:08.304
Gotta keep your electrolytes up.

34:08.815 --> 34:10.114
I got it!

34:10.139 --> 34:12.049
Cal Tech was cool with
you borrowing these?

34:12.074 --> 34:14.103
If by borrowing you mean breaking
into the lockers where they're kept

34:14.128 --> 34:16.850
and shoving them in grocery bags before
walking out, yeah, they're very cool.

34:16.875 --> 34:18.661
All right, once we
harness all the subjects

34:18.686 --> 34:19.906
together, we'll wire them up
like a daisy chain.

34:19.931 --> 34:21.520
I'll network all five
memories into my console.

34:21.545 --> 34:23.025
- How long?
- 15 minutes.

34:23.049 --> 34:25.514
You have 10.

34:34.362 --> 34:37.259
Listen up, Daisy-Mae.
I don't know what to expect in there,

34:37.373 --> 34:39.614
so keep your cool,
and at the first sign of trouble...

34:39.639 --> 34:41.520
I'll bounce. Don't worry.

34:41.545 --> 34:44.050
Fasten your seatbelt,
it's gonna be a bumpy ride.

34:44.074 --> 34:45.568
Lights at 20%, please.

34:46.610 --> 34:50.692
Induce multiple stitch
neurosyncs on my mark

34:50.717 --> 34:57.431
in three, two, one, mark.

35:00.826 --> 35:04.914
I understand, but you'll have to look
for it after we're on the ground.

35:09.090 --> 35:11.279
(distortion)

35:14.208 --> 35:16.829
Lucky I found this.

35:19.129 --> 35:21.438
_

35:22.622 --> 35:24.470
But his name's Vincent, not Jay...

35:24.495 --> 35:26.445
Who, Kirsten?

35:28.041 --> 35:31.009
♪ We next in line, slide it up inside ♪

35:34.236 --> 35:37.422
Half the money is in your account.

35:37.447 --> 35:39.184
Once you're out...

35:39.209 --> 35:41.593
(distortion)

35:43.255 --> 35:45.972
I'll deposit the other half.

35:45.997 --> 35:48.386
You and Maria...

35:48.870 --> 35:51.929
will be set for life.

35:51.954 --> 35:56.194
Here. Keep this right here.

36:00.094 --> 36:03.598
Get used to the name "Vincent Grant."

36:03.623 --> 36:05.430
I'm Jay Kolder now.

36:05.455 --> 36:07.472
Got it.

36:11.914 --> 36:14.774
The two men in the terminal,
Vincent and Jay,

36:14.799 --> 36:16.576
they swapped identities.

36:16.601 --> 36:19.934
The man with the smartwatch
is really Vincent Grant.

36:19.959 --> 36:24.161
It is. I'm just setting
it for Los Angeles time.

36:24.186 --> 36:25.551
Okay. Thank you.

36:25.576 --> 36:28.137
Dude, can I squeeze past you?

36:28.163 --> 36:30.213
Sure.

36:31.045 --> 36:34.375
Jay told Deedee that he was
setting his smartwatch for LA time.

36:34.400 --> 36:37.241
He lied. He started a
timer for 45 seconds.

36:44.929 --> 36:46.573
Death moment in five seconds!

36:46.598 --> 36:49.008
Kirsten, bounce in four, three...

36:49.033 --> 36:50.941
<i>Good morning, this is
your captain speaking.</i>

36:50.967 --> 36:53.324
<i>We are making our final
descent into Los Ang...</i>

36:53.349 --> 36:54.349
(beeping)

37:04.001 --> 37:06.837
So, the Vincent Grant
that died on the plane

37:06.862 --> 37:09.363
was actually Jay Kolden.

37:09.388 --> 37:13.231
He was paid to swap identities and go to
prison in place of the real Vincent Grant.

37:13.256 --> 37:14.923
People won't look for you
if they think you're dead.

37:14.948 --> 37:16.656
Is Vincent Grant a known fugitive?

37:16.681 --> 37:19.208
Oh, a push notice.
Vincent Grant is a known alias

37:19.233 --> 37:22.525
for a high-tech arms dealer on the FBI's
most wanted list. So that's a big yes.

37:22.551 --> 37:23.732
Then Vincent must have
turned his smartwatch

37:23.757 --> 37:25.409
into an electromagnetic field emitter.

37:25.434 --> 37:27.033
That explains the flickering lights.

37:27.058 --> 37:30.185
And not just that, but an EMF
could interact with an RFID chip

37:30.210 --> 37:31.756
to create an electrical
charge strong enough

37:31.781 --> 37:33.730
to mess up the natural
rhythm of a person's heart.

37:33.755 --> 37:35.117
An instant heart attack.

37:35.142 --> 37:38.548
And Vincent made sure that Jay had
his passport right over his heart.

37:38.574 --> 37:40.056
Jay was the real target.

37:40.081 --> 37:44.203
Anyone else who had their passport in their
front pocket was just collateral damage.

37:44.228 --> 37:45.783
Tell me we can still get this bastard?

37:45.808 --> 37:47.827
24 hours was up five minutes ago.

37:47.852 --> 37:50.017
Vincent and the rest of the
passengers were just released.

37:50.042 --> 37:51.928
And, according to the updated manifest,

37:51.953 --> 37:55.341
the passenger formerly known as Jay
Kolden, 7C is no longer on the flight.

37:55.366 --> 37:56.896
Meaning he could be
anywhere at this point.

37:56.921 --> 37:59.353
And if he's smart,
he's using a different name.

38:02.673 --> 38:05.677
I saw something else on the smartwatch

38:05.702 --> 38:08.605
in an earlier stitch. Hand me a notepad.

38:09.715 --> 38:12.358
- Here.
- Thanks.

38:12.840 --> 38:15.828
(pen scratching)

38:17.897 --> 38:19.726
Does this mean anything to anyone?

38:19.751 --> 38:23.376
That looks like the logo
for the Tokyo metro system.

38:23.401 --> 38:24.712
I did a semester abroad.

38:24.736 --> 38:26.379
Look familiar?

38:26.405 --> 38:28.198
That's it.

38:28.222 --> 38:31.357
The Tokyo metro system has an
app available for smartwatches.

38:31.382 --> 38:35.361
Find out when the next flight leaves
LAX for Tokyo. You can ID him?

38:35.386 --> 38:37.415
I've seen his face enough
in the last 24 hours.

38:37.440 --> 38:39.741
- Go get him.
- Okay.

38:42.611 --> 38:45.472
PA System: <i>Boarding call
for flight 1205 to Tokyo...</i>

38:46.228 --> 38:49.116
You see Vincent?

38:53.023 --> 38:55.578
There.

38:56.518 --> 38:58.234
Hey, whoa. Hang back.

38:58.259 --> 39:00.868
- I don't want to make a scene.
- Okay.

39:11.161 --> 39:14.481
Make things difficult,
Vincent, and you'll regret it.

39:14.506 --> 39:15.494
Who are you?

39:15.519 --> 39:18.156
LAPD, NSA, take your pick.

39:18.181 --> 39:19.657
They didn't even offer us coffee

39:19.682 --> 39:21.913
so I had to stand in this giant
line just to get my latte.

39:21.938 --> 39:24.315
Listen, I want a new laptop
waiting for me when I get there.

39:24.340 --> 39:26.062
I know how you killed those people.

39:26.087 --> 39:29.647
Which means you know how I'm
gonna kill everyone around me

39:29.672 --> 39:31.329
who has a passport near their heart

39:31.354 --> 39:33.245
unless you let me walk out of here.

39:33.271 --> 39:34.921
I'm not gonna let you do that.

39:34.946 --> 39:37.491
October 2003.

39:37.516 --> 39:38.614
What about it?

39:38.639 --> 39:40.322
That was the date that the LAPD

39:40.347 --> 39:43.889
first started embedding RFID
chips into their ID cards.

39:44.735 --> 39:47.004
Just like that one.

39:48.675 --> 39:50.055
Goodbye, Detective.

39:50.080 --> 39:50.792
Excuse me!

39:50.817 --> 39:52.745
Aagh!

39:54.638 --> 39:56.942
Good going.

39:58.797 --> 40:01.593
Oh, uh...

40:06.740 --> 40:09.075
Thanks.

40:17.777 --> 40:20.575
(sighs)

40:25.079 --> 40:27.045
Crap.

40:28.149 --> 40:35.400
_

40:35.425 --> 40:37.128
(beeps)

40:37.153 --> 40:40.385
_

40:50.640 --> 40:54.549
(phone ringing)

40:55.479 --> 40:57.798
I figured you'd be passed out by now.

40:57.823 --> 41:01.847
I forgot to tell you Nina
called you yesterday.

41:01.871 --> 41:03.337
You should call her back.

41:03.362 --> 41:05.730
Yeah. Yeah, I'll get on that.

41:05.756 --> 41:07.520
<i>- How you feeling?</i>
- Exhausted.

41:07.545 --> 41:09.726
Maybe it's the jet lag?

41:09.894 --> 41:13.399
Ha ha, it's way too early for jokes.

41:14.062 --> 41:18.348
I'll see you in three
days after I wake up.

41:18.373 --> 41:20.383
Okay. Sweet dreams.

41:23.566 --> 41:25.793
(grunts)

41:27.118 --> 41:28.411
(phone ringing)

41:28.436 --> 41:29.870
Mmm...

41:29.895 --> 41:31.666
Hello?

41:31.691 --> 41:33.631
<i>It's Ivy.</i>

41:34.570 --> 41:37.272
<i>I've changed my mind. When can we meet?</i>

41:41.963 --> 41:43.963
<i>(theme music plays)</i>

42:02.811 --> 42:09.731
<i>♪ Take me inside ♪</i>
