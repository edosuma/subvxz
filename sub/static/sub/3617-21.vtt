WEBVTT

00:03.869 --> 00:07.721
I am really glad
Elise made me call you.

00:07.822 --> 00:10.078
You're exactly the kind
of guy I've been looking for.

00:10.178 --> 00:13.691
- Is that so?
- Oh, it is "so" so.

00:14.530 --> 00:17.863
You're cute,
you're sweet, you're smart.

00:17.963 --> 00:21.816
And from what I hear,
you're raking in the dough.

00:21.916 --> 00:24.292
Well, you have quite the way
with words, don't you?

00:24.392 --> 00:28.264
Yeah, well when it comes to
helping needy children, I'm shameless.

00:29.501 --> 00:34.154
Come on, Evan, please do the
charity auction. It'll be fun.

00:34.254 --> 00:37.687
It'll be fun to be auctioned
off like a side of beef.

00:39.204 --> 00:42.018
Yeah, well, it's not like we're
asking you to marry the highest bidder.

00:42.118 --> 00:47.449
It's just, you know, one little date
and one little tax-deductible donation,

00:47.549 --> 00:49.964
you know, to match your lady's bid.

00:50.064 --> 00:53.258
Is there any chance "Ask Phoebe"
will be doing some bidding?

00:54.655 --> 00:58.688
Well, you'll just have to
sign up to find that out.

01:04.197 --> 01:06.593
Then I graduated from
Stanford Law in '98.

01:07.232 --> 01:08.290
Harvard Law.

01:08.390 --> 01:09.768
That's impressive.

01:09.868 --> 01:11.644
So do you want to
give to a charity or what?

01:11.744 --> 01:13.521
I said Stanford, not Harvard.

01:13.621 --> 01:16.794
Let me ask you something.
Have you been having any kind of

01:16.894 --> 01:20.348
end-of-the-world, fire-and-brimstone
doomsday kind of dreams lately?

01:20.448 --> 01:22.843
Wait a minute. Is this
some sort of religious charity?

01:23.881 --> 01:26.696
No, it's not, it's for children.

01:26.796 --> 01:28.932
Right.

01:29.032 --> 01:31.007
Hey, to each his own.

01:31.107 --> 01:33.304
But I'm not into the
whole fire-and-brimstone thing.

01:34.182 --> 01:36.438
Paige, you're supposed to be flirting
with the bachelors,

01:36.538 --> 01:38.634
- not frightening them.
- I'm sorry.

01:38.734 --> 01:40.591
I guess I'm just a little off.

01:40.691 --> 01:43.744
My boyfriend moved to Hong Kong.
I'm thoroughly depressed.

01:43.844 --> 01:47.178
But I still managed to
sign up six people and you have...

01:47.278 --> 01:51.051
- I have none people.
- None people.

01:51.151 --> 01:54.086
Paige, I know you've been in a bad
mood, but this is getting a little crazy.

01:54.186 --> 01:58.197
What? I barely slept all week,
I keep having these strange dreams

01:58.297 --> 02:01.472
about ancient wars
and weird magic...

02:01.572 --> 02:03.268
It's all very disturbing.

02:03.368 --> 02:05.703
- Do you think they mean something?
- I don't know.

02:05.803 --> 02:07.461
It could be hormones.

02:07.561 --> 02:09.377
More likely it could be
my subconscious

02:09.477 --> 02:11.473
trying to tell me something.

03:04.216 --> 03:07.170
It worked! You're alive!

03:14.876 --> 03:18.649
- How long?
- How long?

03:18.749 --> 03:20.764
Three thousand years,
give or take a century.

03:20.864 --> 03:22.860
What?

03:26.973 --> 03:30.227
- Who are you?
- Me?

03:30.327 --> 03:35.178
I'm the demon who spent
decades trying to free you!

03:35.278 --> 03:38.432
Now you're gonna return the favour.

03:39.750 --> 03:42.205
It wasn't easy either.

03:42.305 --> 03:45.239
The world's forgotten about you.

03:45.339 --> 03:48.912
But I had a vision.
If I could somehow revive you,

03:49.012 --> 03:53.723
I could use your power
to bring myself to glory.

03:54.761 --> 03:58.236
Rule the underworld
as I was always meant to!

04:04.224 --> 04:06.720
Lmbecile.

04:06.820 --> 04:11.011
Oh, I love it when you
smite so unexpectedly.

04:19.156 --> 04:23.688
We have to find
Cronus and free him as well.

04:23.788 --> 04:27.381
Do we have to?
You know he'll be furious.

04:28.459 --> 04:31.573
I am counting on it.

06:22.608 --> 06:25.742
For the love that is
everything good and pure

06:25.842 --> 06:28.656
why have we never
bothered to get air conditioning?

06:28.756 --> 06:30.573
Because we live in San Francisco

06:30.673 --> 06:34.007
where the temperature
rarely goes above 75 degrees.

06:34.107 --> 06:37.200
Okay, well, it's at 90 now,
can we get one today, please?

06:37.300 --> 06:42.891
Yeah, we could, if it was
not for this little expenditure here.

06:45.885 --> 06:49.298
Yeah, that's a lot of phone
calls to Hong Kong.

06:49.398 --> 06:50.655
Yes, it is.

06:50.755 --> 06:53.730
Okay, before you start yelling,
let me just explain to you

06:53.830 --> 06:56.724
that I'm trying to figure out where
Jason and I stand and to do that

06:56.824 --> 06:58.361
it requires a lot of phone calls.

06:58.461 --> 07:00.437
You're gonna throw that
glass at me, aren't you?

07:00.537 --> 07:02.155
No, honey, I get it.

07:02.255 --> 07:04.710
You know, it is a very big phone bill.

07:04.810 --> 07:08.862
But if you have to choose between
true love and air conditioning

07:08.962 --> 07:10.699
I'd say it's a no-brainer.

07:10.799 --> 07:12.894
Who are you and what
have you done to my sister?

07:12.994 --> 07:15.210
What, I can't be in a good mood?

07:15.310 --> 07:19.083
No, Mary Poppins wouldn't be
in a good mood in this kind of heat.

07:19.183 --> 07:21.399
Well, Wyatt is finally
sleeping through the night

07:21.499 --> 07:23.754
and my hormones
are back in whack

07:23.854 --> 07:26.270
and you know,
Leo and I are finally...

07:26.370 --> 07:29.863
- Back in the saddle?
- So to speak.

07:29.963 --> 07:32.738
Yay, you!
God, I miss sex!

07:32.838 --> 07:35.852
I gotta tell you, life is feeling
pretty damn good at the moment.

07:35.952 --> 07:38.647
So where is your lucky
husband and my perfect nephew?

07:38.747 --> 07:41.841
They are shopping for
a present for Darryl's son.

07:41.941 --> 07:45.035
Look at you.
You're like soccer mom.

07:45.135 --> 07:48.588
Dare I say it,
your life is almost normal?

07:48.688 --> 07:51.383
There is nothing
normal about this heat.

07:51.483 --> 07:52.981
Good morning, sunshine.

07:53.081 --> 07:55.416
Oh, save the quips
and pass the caffeine.

07:55.516 --> 07:57.092
I have work to do.

07:57.192 --> 08:00.526
Are you gonna scry for Mother Nature
and have a Wiccan word with her?

08:00.626 --> 08:03.121
Okay, you're way too perky,
all right?

08:03.221 --> 08:05.078
And you're frightening me.
I'm just saying.

08:05.178 --> 08:06.954
So you think this
weather's demonic?

08:07.054 --> 08:09.270
I don't know,
there's just something weird.

08:09.370 --> 08:11.865
I keep waking up all week
long with these fiery dreams.

08:11.965 --> 08:14.181
What am I supposed to think?

08:14.281 --> 08:16.576
You're not getting a God
complex or something, are you?

08:16.676 --> 08:18.054
They've got medication for that.

08:18.154 --> 08:21.647
I didn't say my dreams
caused it, I'm just...

08:21.747 --> 08:23.484
I don't know what I'm saying.

08:23.584 --> 08:25.800
Honey, maybe you need to
get out a little more.

08:25.900 --> 08:28.953
Well, this isn't just
me being obsessive.

08:29.053 --> 08:32.946
Okay, maybe a little bit, but it's
not just psychological or emotional,

08:33.046 --> 08:35.422
I really, really think
there's something...

08:35.522 --> 08:37.697
Magical?

08:37.797 --> 08:39.972
Yeah, for lack of a better term.

08:40.073 --> 08:42.727
Listen, I don't wanna be a downer,

08:42.828 --> 08:46.341
<i>but I'm gonna go hit the Book so I can</i>
<i>figure out what the hell is going on.</i>

08:48.697 --> 08:52.150
- Should we be worried?
- I don't think so.

08:52.250 --> 08:54.467
But I just wish she'd
stop looking for trouble.

08:54.567 --> 08:56.563
Because with our luck,
she's gonna find it.

09:09.020 --> 09:12.154
There he is, as wrathful as ever.

09:12.254 --> 09:14.349
All the more reason to leave him be.

09:14.449 --> 09:16.186
Careful, Meta.

09:16.286 --> 09:19.140
Demetrius, I'm telling
you we don't need him.

09:19.240 --> 09:23.733
We have more than enough power
to rule without him, you know that.

09:23.833 --> 09:27.964
Just imagine,
a new plague every day.

09:28.064 --> 09:31.319
A monsoon every week.

09:31.419 --> 09:33.614
It will be devastating.

09:35.052 --> 09:39.863
Nevertheless, we will need his
strength to revenge our captors...

09:39.963 --> 09:41.859
...and that is something we all want.

09:41.959 --> 09:44.374
Oh, now, don't pout, Meta.

09:44.474 --> 09:46.650
You might start a hurricane.

09:46.750 --> 09:49.025
And alert them.

09:50.862 --> 09:54.076
Now, go and find the whitelighters.

09:54.176 --> 09:59.646
It won't be long before I free Cronus.
You know how impatient he can get.

10:26.716 --> 10:29.410
Daddy, Daddy, show us your trick!

10:29.510 --> 10:32.645
Trick? I'm sorry, I don't know
what you're talking about.

10:32.745 --> 10:37.236
Hold on a second. Wait,
you have something in your ear.

10:37.336 --> 10:39.392
I do?

10:39.492 --> 10:41.489
Yeah.

10:42.925 --> 10:44.922
You call that magic?

10:46.599 --> 10:49.194
Okay, who wants hot dogs?

10:53.147 --> 10:56.280
Let me guess, first time
the baby slept all night, huh?

10:56.380 --> 10:57.638
How'd you know?

10:57.738 --> 11:00.233
First few months after Mikey
was born were rough, you know.

11:00.333 --> 11:02.469
No sleep, no time for each other.

11:02.569 --> 11:03.827
That sounds familiar.

11:03.927 --> 11:08.259
Yeah, but right about three or four
months, things start to level off.

11:08.359 --> 11:12.251
- Really good again.
- Till he hits 2.

11:12.351 --> 11:14.906
Oh, don't scare them.

11:16.503 --> 11:18.519
Piper, I have to go.

11:18.619 --> 11:23.132
- But we just got here.
- I know, baby, but it's the Elders.

11:24.329 --> 11:26.465
Don't worry, she knows.

11:26.565 --> 11:28.881
Your secret's safe with me.
Argue away.

11:30.558 --> 11:32.913
Honey, I'm sorry,
but it sounds urgent.

11:34.390 --> 11:37.604
Okay, well, then I need
to express to you

11:37.704 --> 11:40.678
that this is gonna make
me feel a little abandoned.

11:40.778 --> 11:42.555
All right, well, I understand.

11:42.655 --> 11:47.346
I acknowledge your feelings and
I want to let you know that I love you,

11:47.446 --> 11:50.380
even though I have to go.

11:50.480 --> 11:53.255
- Darryl, stop.
- What's so funny?

11:53.355 --> 11:56.430
Nothing, just...
Marriage counselling, huh?

11:56.829 --> 12:00.841
Honey, we did it too.
We recognize the tools.

12:00.941 --> 12:03.157
I think I hate the tools.
I'd rather just snipe later

12:03.257 --> 12:06.830
than be open and honest
about my feelings now.

12:06.930 --> 12:08.786
Yeah, we felt the same way.

12:08.886 --> 12:11.801
But you know what?
Turns out the tools really helped.

12:13.558 --> 12:16.572
- Piper, I have to go.
- Fine, go.

12:16.672 --> 12:20.005
I mean, thank you
for considering my feelings,

12:20.105 --> 12:22.880
and I love you and I will
see you later at home.

12:22.980 --> 12:24.976
Okay.

12:32.443 --> 12:34.440
Very good.

12:36.316 --> 12:38.811
So you'll introduce
the bachelors from here

12:38.911 --> 12:41.187
and then they'll enter from over there.

12:41.666 --> 12:44.960
- Phoebe, you with me?
- I am all over him.

12:45.060 --> 12:46.955
I mean it, all over it.

12:47.055 --> 12:50.908
Phoebe, the newspaper only
sponsors one charity event a year,

12:51.008 --> 12:52.865
and I want this to
go off without a hitch.

12:52.965 --> 12:54.821
It will, I promise.

12:54.921 --> 12:56.617
Okay, that's what I like to hear.

12:56.717 --> 12:59.452
Oh, and please thank your
sister again for donating her club.

12:59.552 --> 13:02.607
I just hope everyone doesn't melt
by the time they get here.

13:02.707 --> 13:05.961
It's gonna be kind of hard
to auction off bachelor soup.

13:06.061 --> 13:08.516
It is bizarre weather, isn't it?

13:08.616 --> 13:12.429
I spoke to Jason this morning and he
says it's the same way in Hong Kong.

13:12.529 --> 13:14.525
You spoke to Jason?

13:15.403 --> 13:17.400
Did he mention me?

13:18.638 --> 13:21.212
Look, not that it's
any of my business...

13:21.312 --> 13:23.329
...but are you sure you
wanna tether yourself

13:23.429 --> 13:25.365
to a boyfriend who's
halfway across the world?

13:25.465 --> 13:26.522
I know.

13:26.622 --> 13:30.935
And the truth is, this heat is
kind of making me a little boy-crazy.

13:31.413 --> 13:35.746
It just feels really weird to end
a good relationship so abruptly.

13:35.846 --> 13:38.580
- He's the one who moved away.
- I know.

13:38.680 --> 13:42.133
And at the risk of advising
an advice columnist...

13:42.233 --> 13:44.968
...I say you bid on a
bachelor or two tomorrow.

13:45.068 --> 13:47.364
That way I can live
vicariously through you.

13:47.464 --> 13:50.139
Oh, Elise, you brazen hussy!

13:53.333 --> 13:55.868
Oh, my God!

13:55.968 --> 13:58.983
- What, what is it?
- Nothing. Hold that thought.

13:59.083 --> 14:00.140
What thought?

14:00.240 --> 14:03.014
Paige, are you out of your mind?

14:03.114 --> 14:04.852
As it turns out, I am not.

14:04.952 --> 14:06.807
Listen, we are in big trouble.

14:06.907 --> 14:09.922
Yeah, you almost exposed
our magic to a room full of people.

14:10.022 --> 14:12.518
No, listen. I studied the I Ching,

14:12.618 --> 14:16.111
tarot cards, runes and tea leaves and
they're all giving me the same reading.

14:16.211 --> 14:17.987
That you need a good night's sleep?

14:18.087 --> 14:21.242
No, that there's something big
going on in the supernatural world.

14:22.000 --> 14:25.213
If my reading is right,
it's not just the thunder and the heat.

14:25.313 --> 14:27.530
We could be in store
for a big earthquake or worse.

14:27.630 --> 14:30.764
Okay, so what do you want us to do?
Do you have a plan?

14:30.864 --> 14:32.680
Not so much a plan as a location.

14:32.780 --> 14:35.335
I scryed for evil and one place
kept coming up red-hot.

14:36.014 --> 14:39.727
Take this. You're gonna need it.
We're going on a trip.

14:42.641 --> 14:46.175
Okay, there's a reason nobody
lives in this part of the world,

14:46.275 --> 14:49.449
and it's because
they all died from the cold.

14:49.549 --> 14:51.445
I thought you said
you wanted air conditioning.

14:51.545 --> 14:52.963
Oh, this sucks!

14:53.063 --> 14:54.958
Scorch mark, see if
you can get a premonition.

14:55.058 --> 14:56.796
I don't have my gloves!

14:56.896 --> 14:59.531
Tough it out, I got us this far.

15:00.049 --> 15:02.046
Okay, fine.

15:08.115 --> 15:11.868
- Did you get anything?
- Yeah, frostbite. Shush.

15:16.818 --> 15:19.034
- Oh, hot, hot, hot!
- Hot?

15:19.134 --> 15:21.110
No, not here hot.

15:21.210 --> 15:23.486
- In my vision.
- Vision? Good, tell me what it is.

15:24.524 --> 15:29.555
Two very large someones
coming out of that wall.

15:32.270 --> 15:34.466
- Who?
- I don't know.

15:52.632 --> 15:54.329
Demetrius.

15:54.429 --> 15:55.926
My lord.

15:56.026 --> 15:58.022
They did this to me.

15:58.422 --> 15:59.758
To me!

15:59.858 --> 16:03.073
- They will be punished.
- Punished?

16:03.173 --> 16:06.566
I will obliterate them!

16:15.510 --> 16:18.983
Earthquake. Did I call it or what?

16:19.981 --> 16:22.317
Did I mention this sucks?

16:22.417 --> 16:24.413
Yeah.

16:33.157 --> 16:37.609
I know it's cooled off a little bit since
this morning, but what are you doing?

16:37.709 --> 16:39.445
Defrosting.

16:39.545 --> 16:40.723
Is this them?

16:40.823 --> 16:42.440
- No.
- Who's them?

16:42.540 --> 16:44.036
We're not sure yet.

16:44.136 --> 16:46.193
- How was the party?
- Oh, just super fun.

16:46.293 --> 16:48.229
Leo got called away
and I got to use my tools.

16:48.329 --> 16:49.946
- What?
- Is that them?

16:50.046 --> 16:53.818
No, they looked a little
bit more... ancient.

16:53.918 --> 16:56.175
Will someone please
tell me what's going on?

16:56.275 --> 16:57.931
A whitelighter's disappeared.

16:58.031 --> 17:00.007
A whitelighter?
Like from a darklighter?

17:00.107 --> 17:02.403
No, a darklighter's poison
is slow and painful.

17:02.503 --> 17:04.039
This was more instantaneous,

17:04.138 --> 17:06.595
and the Elders have no
idea what it could have been.

17:06.694 --> 17:08.910
- It's all connected.
- What's connected?

17:09.010 --> 17:11.346
Whatever it is that
escaped from that ice cave.

17:11.445 --> 17:12.742
You were in an ice cave?

17:12.843 --> 17:14.699
The heat wave, the earthquake,
my dreams,

17:14.799 --> 17:16.736
this is bigger
than any one whitelighter.

17:16.836 --> 17:19.172
I better drop out
of that charity benefit.

17:19.271 --> 17:21.167
- Maybe we should cancel counselling.
- Hold it.

17:21.268 --> 17:25.319
Wait a minute. This is exactly what we
are supposed to be learning in therapy.

17:25.420 --> 17:27.396
When to put our lives on hold
and when not to.

17:27.496 --> 17:29.353
But, Piper, a whitelighter was killed.

17:29.453 --> 17:30.671
We don't know that.

17:30.771 --> 17:33.305
He could have just clipped
his wings and he's in hiding.

17:33.405 --> 17:35.701
- Is that possible?
- Yeah, I guess.

17:35.801 --> 17:38.655
Look, people, we just need to
manage our lives a little bit better.

17:38.755 --> 17:40.971
Dr. Barenson says that
needless worry and panic

17:41.071 --> 17:44.444
serve absolutely no purpose, except to
prevent the possibility of happiness.

17:44.544 --> 17:47.000
I am all for
the possibility of happiness.

17:47.100 --> 17:49.875
Good, so we need to address
the immediate problem at hand

17:49.975 --> 17:51.951
and circle the wagons
only when we have to.

17:52.051 --> 17:55.025
Leo, maybe you should get the Elders
to put a ban on whitelighters orbing

17:55.125 --> 17:57.261
until we figure out
exactly what's going on.

17:57.361 --> 17:59.617
Okay, I'll meet you at therapy.

17:59.717 --> 18:01.334
Okay, don't be late.

18:01.434 --> 18:03.370
Is it safe for you
to orb up there right now?

18:03.470 --> 18:06.025
Yeah. No worrying, remember?

18:21.956 --> 18:23.692
What's going on?

18:23.792 --> 18:25.769
What's with all the activity?
I just left here.

18:25.869 --> 18:28.084
- It's not your concern.
- Roland, please.

18:28.184 --> 18:30.120
Actually, we're not sure, Leo.

18:30.220 --> 18:32.316
But we do know that
something's not quite right.

18:32.416 --> 18:34.433
- Has another whitelighter been...?
- No.

18:34.533 --> 18:36.189
It's something else.

18:36.289 --> 18:39.802
Something we're not at liberty to
discuss outside the council of Elders.

18:40.920 --> 18:43.835
Anything to do with heat waves?
Earthquakes?

18:49.305 --> 18:50.523
What do you know?

18:50.623 --> 18:53.437
Not much, just that Paige has been
having these strange dreams lately.

18:53.537 --> 18:55.234
Dreams that seem pretty prophetic.

18:55.334 --> 18:57.749
You think she foresaw
these earthquakes?

18:57.849 --> 19:00.065
- Yes.
- That's not her power.

19:00.165 --> 19:02.301
It's not a power,
it's more of an instinct.

19:02.401 --> 19:04.896
An instinct?
That's what you're basing this on?

19:04.996 --> 19:07.491
Well, it hasn't let her down
so far, has it?

19:07.591 --> 19:11.045
Look, excuse me, but I've
just learned to rely on her instincts.

19:11.145 --> 19:12.642
All of their instincts.

19:12.742 --> 19:14.957
As well you should have, Leo.

19:15.057 --> 19:17.553
Now, what did you
come up here to tell us?

19:17.653 --> 19:20.347
Just that the girls think...

19:20.447 --> 19:22.504
...well, that we all think
that maybe we should

19:22.604 --> 19:25.917
ground all whitelighters
until we know for sure that it's safe.

19:29.510 --> 19:30.808
We agree.

19:30.908 --> 19:33.303
We'll initiate the orders
as soon as you've returned to them.

19:35.180 --> 19:39.152
In the meantime,
keep them working on this.

19:39.252 --> 19:41.708
It's important.

19:41.808 --> 19:43.544
You're worried, aren't you?

19:43.644 --> 19:45.501
You know me better than that.

19:45.601 --> 19:50.272
At the end of the day, even we
can't change what's meant to be.

19:51.470 --> 19:53.286
Just remember,
no matter what happens,

19:53.386 --> 19:56.420
you must always
follow your instincts too.

20:08.878 --> 20:09.935
Christa!

20:10.035 --> 20:12.031
It's about time
you came to heal your charge.

20:12.591 --> 20:13.848
Who are you? What do you want?

20:13.948 --> 20:15.944
A whitelighter.

20:33.990 --> 20:36.765
It's good to see you again, my lord.

20:36.865 --> 20:39.860
You never were a good liar, Meta.

20:41.896 --> 20:43.074
Where's the third one?

20:43.174 --> 20:46.847
Unfortunately, whitelighters are
not as easy to find in this time.

20:47.525 --> 20:51.338
Much has changed. Magic is
no longer practiced so openly.

20:51.438 --> 20:55.471
Much may have changed,
but you certainly haven't.

20:57.068 --> 20:58.885
You know, it always...

20:58.985 --> 21:01.440
...amazed me how someone...

21:01.540 --> 21:05.931
...as beautiful as you
could so easily turn a mortal to stone.

21:08.447 --> 21:10.444
You haven't changed a bit, have you?

21:12.200 --> 21:14.197
- She stays behind.
- No, she can't!

21:14.635 --> 21:16.332
We are stronger as three than two.

21:16.432 --> 21:18.368
We will need
every ounce of that strength

21:18.468 --> 21:20.325
if we are to take
revenge on our captors.

21:20.425 --> 21:23.559
But if we wait, we risk them
finding out we've been awakened.

21:23.659 --> 21:26.594
Then even with orbs,
we will not be able to break in.

21:26.694 --> 21:28.710
Then that is a risk
we will have to take.

21:28.810 --> 21:30.705
Says who?

21:30.805 --> 21:33.301
You, Demetrius?

21:33.401 --> 21:36.494
- Are you challenging me?
- No!

21:36.594 --> 21:39.589
No, of course he's not, Cronus.

21:40.787 --> 21:43.682
I've brought power
enough for both of you.

21:43.782 --> 21:48.173
You can take them and use them
to find a third whitelighter for me.

21:48.573 --> 21:50.429
And if we can't?

21:50.529 --> 21:56.638
Then I suppose I'll just
have to let you boys handle it.

22:23.109 --> 22:25.005
- Leo?
- Sorry, honey.

22:25.105 --> 22:26.802
I was starting to get
worried about you.

22:26.902 --> 22:30.594
I know, I know,
I came as fast as I could.

22:30.694 --> 22:33.349
Well, what happened?
What took so long?

22:33.449 --> 22:36.304
I don't know.
They don't know.

22:36.404 --> 22:37.981
But we can talk about it later.

22:38.081 --> 22:39.898
Right now our first priority is us.

22:39.998 --> 22:42.813
Good answer, because I don't think
there's enough tools in the box

22:42.913 --> 22:44.908
to handle being stood up
at the shrink.

22:45.627 --> 22:47.644
No way. Are you kidding me?

22:47.744 --> 22:49.400
It sounds important.

22:49.500 --> 22:52.554
- But you were just there.
- I know.

22:52.654 --> 22:55.269
Look, I acknowledge that
this is very difficult for you.

22:55.369 --> 22:57.366
You know what, screw that!
Damn it!

23:01.278 --> 23:03.834
I'm just scared.

23:04.832 --> 23:06.928
But I told you it was
safe orbing up there.

23:07.028 --> 23:08.565
No, not about that.

23:08.665 --> 23:11.519
I'm scared that, you know,
every time something good happens,

23:11.619 --> 23:14.514
every time I actually think we
can have a normal life together,

23:14.614 --> 23:15.951
something goes wrong.

23:16.051 --> 23:18.347
Piper, I have to go.

23:18.447 --> 23:22.000
I know.
And I know it's not your fault.

23:23.636 --> 23:26.431
It's just the way that it is.

23:28.388 --> 23:30.584
I love you.

23:42.681 --> 23:43.939
Phoebe!

23:44.039 --> 23:46.035
Hey, Phoebe!

23:47.393 --> 23:50.248
- Did you find something?
- Do "Titans" ring a bell?

23:50.348 --> 23:52.922
Titans, like from ancient Greece?
You have got to be kidding me.

23:53.022 --> 23:54.359
Ancient gods who were entombed

23:54.459 --> 23:56.436
because it was
the only way to stop them.

23:56.536 --> 23:59.949
Okay, well, even if it is them,
how did they get out?

24:00.049 --> 24:02.305
- And why go after the whitelighters?
- I don't know.

24:02.405 --> 24:05.459
Maybe one of them was hurt,
maybe they needed healing powers.

24:05.559 --> 24:08.334
I do know that because of
the Elders' no-orbing edict

24:08.434 --> 24:12.247
that the only way they're gonna
get another whitelighter is if one:

24:12.347 --> 24:15.241
Oh, no way, Paige.
Forget about it.

24:15.341 --> 24:17.716
Why not? If I'm right,
they will come right to us.

24:17.816 --> 24:20.072
Oh, and you're saying this
like it's a good thing?

24:20.172 --> 24:22.867
It is! This is why
I haven't been sleeping.

24:22.967 --> 24:25.062
This is what I've been
preparing for all year.

24:25.162 --> 24:27.778
I have got potions here
that are stronger

24:27.878 --> 24:30.573
than the ones
that we used on The Source.

24:30.673 --> 24:34.006
Okay, devil's advocate: Until we
figure out how powerful they are

24:34.106 --> 24:35.484
we shouldn't use you as bait.

24:35.584 --> 24:38.597
Witch's advocate: There are evil
gods running around on the loose

24:38.697 --> 24:40.913
that we should eliminate
before Wyatt gets home.

24:41.013 --> 24:42.310
That's dirty. Why do I feel like

24:42.410 --> 24:45.305
you're making me choose
between my sister and my nephew?

24:45.405 --> 24:47.181
Because you're slightly over-dramatic?

24:47.281 --> 24:49.098
I'm a little over-dramatic?

24:49.198 --> 24:50.695
Look, can we just do this, please?

24:50.795 --> 24:52.652
Okay, fine.

24:52.752 --> 24:55.885
Bring on the
earthquake-causing gods.

24:55.985 --> 24:58.022
Watch this.

25:21.419 --> 25:23.415
Don't look into her eyes!

25:31.001 --> 25:32.997
You all right?

25:37.150 --> 25:39.225
Oh, my God, Paige!

25:50.125 --> 25:52.202
Don't worry, she's all right.

25:53.080 --> 25:57.851
Well, I mean, she's not completely all
right, obviously, but she's not dead.

25:57.951 --> 25:59.448
Are you sure she's not?

25:59.548 --> 26:00.925
Frankly, you see this a lot.

26:01.025 --> 26:03.200
Museums, universities, town centres,

26:03.300 --> 26:06.395
most of those
statues aren't really statues.

26:06.495 --> 26:10.847
They're people like your sister
here who've been turned into stone.

26:11.726 --> 26:13.821
- Who are you?
- Chris.

26:13.921 --> 26:18.473
Chris Perry.
I'm... from the future.

26:18.952 --> 26:21.447
Oh, my God!

26:21.547 --> 26:25.081
Tell me that's just a really
good likeness of Paige.

26:25.181 --> 26:26.837
No, it's Paige.

26:26.937 --> 26:28.914
- A Titan turned her to stone.
- A who?

26:29.014 --> 26:31.189
- Who are you?
- That's Chris.

26:31.289 --> 26:34.563
- He's from the future.
- Yeah, but just like 20 years or so.

26:36.479 --> 26:38.296
- Friend or foe?
- I'm not so sure yet.

26:38.396 --> 26:40.652
What do you mean?
I saved Paige, didn't I?

26:40.752 --> 26:42.807
Oh, you call that saving, do you?

26:42.907 --> 26:45.003
Hey, I'm the one who
put my life on the line here.

26:45.103 --> 26:47.040
I didn't have to drop
everything I was doing

26:47.140 --> 26:48.836
just to orb in
and save her butt from...

26:48.936 --> 26:52.231
You...? You orb?
You're a whitelighter?

26:52.331 --> 26:54.426
Look, where I come from,

26:54.526 --> 26:57.340
history shows Paige didn't get
turned to stone on this day.

26:57.440 --> 26:59.437
She died.

26:59.757 --> 27:01.813
And with her death,
the power of three died too

27:01.913 --> 27:05.206
allowing Titans to rule and
create a world you don't wanna see.

27:05.306 --> 27:08.021
Trust me.
I'm here to alter history.

27:08.739 --> 27:11.694
- To help you save the future.
- Who sent you?

27:13.610 --> 27:15.906
- I can't answer that.
- Why not?

27:16.006 --> 27:17.184
Because anything I tell you

27:17.284 --> 27:19.779
could risk changing the future
in ways we don't want.

27:19.879 --> 27:20.977
Who's "we"?

27:21.077 --> 27:24.051
All I gotta say is that
if I hadn't gotten here when I did,

27:24.151 --> 27:26.287
Paige would've been
the third whitelighter victim.

27:26.387 --> 27:29.701
Wait, third?
I thought only one was missing.

27:30.540 --> 27:32.675
Not anymore.

27:32.775 --> 27:35.011
Leo? Leo!

27:36.129 --> 27:37.825
Honey, I'm sorry
I missed counselling but...

27:37.925 --> 27:39.922
Forget that,
we've got bigger problems.

27:41.120 --> 27:42.856
- What happened?
- Forget that too.

27:42.956 --> 27:44.373
How many
whitelighters are missing?

27:44.473 --> 27:46.470
- What?
- How many?

27:47.308 --> 27:49.304
Two, that's what
the Elders just called me for.

27:49.784 --> 27:51.640
Believe me now?

27:51.740 --> 27:53.737
Who's he?

27:54.095 --> 27:56.332
What was that?

28:14.538 --> 28:16.514
Sorry.

28:16.614 --> 28:18.610
We'll pay for that.

28:19.009 --> 28:21.805
So long as you can
keep the world from ending.

28:23.601 --> 28:27.374
It was a trap.
You were tricked.

28:27.474 --> 28:29.969
Still, there are other whitelighters.

28:30.069 --> 28:31.806
No, we have been discovered.

28:31.906 --> 28:34.162
Your incompetence
has endangered us all!

28:34.262 --> 28:36.397
My incompetence?

28:36.497 --> 28:39.033
I only went where I was told...

28:39.133 --> 28:40.190
...my lord.

28:40.290 --> 28:41.708
It doesn't matter.

28:41.808 --> 28:44.502
We can go back, they will be
no match for the three of us.

28:44.602 --> 28:48.495
Out of the question. We have to attack
our enemies now while we still can!

28:48.595 --> 28:50.371
I won't leave Meta behind.

28:50.471 --> 28:52.966
It's all right, Demetrius.

28:53.066 --> 28:55.542
You won't have to.

28:57.817 --> 28:59.914
No!

29:00.014 --> 29:01.430
Careful, Demetrius.

29:01.530 --> 29:03.507
Either you're with me...

29:03.607 --> 29:05.723
...or you're with her.

29:07.999 --> 29:09.736
Come on, come on,
prance this way.

29:09.836 --> 29:11.093
Here we go, here we go.

29:11.193 --> 29:14.766
Move it, move it, move it, today!

29:14.866 --> 29:17.401
Hey, quit manhandling us.

29:17.501 --> 29:20.515
- We're not your pets.
- No, you're just a pain, now go on.

29:20.615 --> 29:22.991
And don't let the neighbours see you.

29:23.091 --> 29:26.444
Check out the size
of that oracle's... ball.

29:26.884 --> 29:28.880
Phoebe, focus.

29:29.279 --> 29:31.056
Oh!

29:31.156 --> 29:33.691
I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry.

29:33.791 --> 29:36.066
Stay away from those windows.

29:39.461 --> 29:41.916
What the hell
is going on around here?

29:42.016 --> 29:44.790
If you haven't noticed,
the world's a mess out there.

29:44.890 --> 29:47.486
Something terrible's going on.
Everyone senses it.

29:48.204 --> 29:49.941
- The Titans?
- Must be.

29:50.041 --> 29:53.414
So you guys just all came here
figuring we would stop them?

29:53.514 --> 29:56.549
Well, you are the Charmed Ones,
aren't you?

29:59.863 --> 30:02.038
Do you always leave
the little one unattended?

30:02.138 --> 30:03.756
- No!
- No!

30:03.856 --> 30:06.391
Well, just sounds like
he needs to be changed.

30:06.491 --> 30:08.487
- I'll take care of it.
- Hold it!

30:09.086 --> 30:12.060
You are not the nanny,
we rejected you.

30:12.160 --> 30:14.156
No, I rejected you.

30:14.915 --> 30:18.388
But I suppose I could fill in,
just for a bit.

30:20.664 --> 30:23.040
Did she just hire herself?

30:23.140 --> 30:24.277
You need to go watch her.

30:24.377 --> 30:26.833
What about the Elders? They need
to know the Titans are back.

30:26.933 --> 30:29.548
Can't Chris tell them?
He's a whitelighter, isn't he?

30:29.648 --> 30:31.644
Wait a minute.

30:32.043 --> 30:34.039
Where is he?

30:34.599 --> 30:37.174
<i>- Upstairs with Paige.</i>
<i>- And the Book.</i>

30:37.274 --> 30:38.850
All right, you, to the elf.

30:38.950 --> 30:40.887
You keep an eye
on our magical houseguests.

30:40.987 --> 30:43.621
Herd them into the basement
or something.

30:44.181 --> 30:47.654
I'm gonna go see
what future-boy is up to.

30:52.565 --> 30:55.180
- What are you doing?
- What does it look like I'm doing?

30:55.280 --> 30:57.736
I'm trying to find a way to free
stone-cold Paige over here.

30:57.836 --> 30:59.452
Step away.

30:59.552 --> 31:01.908
Please, like I haven't
looked in this before?

31:02.746 --> 31:05.442
By the way, you should
update your goblins entry.

31:05.542 --> 31:08.176
It'll come in handy someday.

31:09.693 --> 31:14.006
- Goblins?
- Yeah. Trust me, it's gonna get ugly.

31:14.964 --> 31:17.819
<i>Look, obviously you don't trust me.</i>
<i>But I touched the Book, right?</i>

31:17.919 --> 31:19.815
<i>And the Book thinks I'm good,</i>
<i>shouldn't you?</i>

31:19.915 --> 31:22.808
- Maybe you found a way around that.
- Piper, come on.

31:22.908 --> 31:24.446
I'm just trying to help.

31:24.546 --> 31:28.359
Well, then, if that's true, why don't you
tell me how to vanquish the Titans?

31:28.459 --> 31:30.694
Except you can't vanquish them.

31:31.094 --> 31:32.750
You mean not without
the power of three?

31:32.850 --> 31:34.268
Maybe not even with that.

31:34.368 --> 31:37.063
The only way the Elders could stop
them 3000 years ago

31:37.163 --> 31:39.658
was by infusing some mortals
with a hell of a lot of power,

31:39.758 --> 31:41.016
way more than you guys have.

31:41.116 --> 31:42.692
So they can do that again.

31:42.792 --> 31:44.409
Not after what happened last time.

31:44.509 --> 31:47.683
When the mortals trapped the Titans,
the power went to their heads.

31:47.783 --> 31:51.156
They declared themselves gods
and forced the world to worship them.

31:51.256 --> 31:54.491
The Elders swore they would
never allow that to happen again.

31:54.809 --> 31:57.904
Hang on a second,
I'm having a 9th-grade flashback.

31:58.004 --> 32:01.058
You're talking about the Greek gods,
Zeus, Athena, Aphrodite?

32:01.158 --> 32:03.453
- They were mortals?
- Mythology left that part out.

32:03.553 --> 32:06.149
Not the only inaccuracy, by the way.

32:07.866 --> 32:10.840
Phoebe, what are you doing?
You're supposed to be...

32:10.940 --> 32:13.315
I know, I know. But I thought
they could help us free Paige.

32:13.415 --> 32:15.870
After all, a leprechaun's luck
has helped us before.

32:15.970 --> 32:18.506
He's the leprechaun,
I'm one of the seven dwarfs.

32:18.606 --> 32:20.603
Try to keep it straight, will you?

32:21.001 --> 32:22.998
Sorry.

32:25.434 --> 32:28.327
It's gonna take a lot more than
just me luck to free this one.

32:28.427 --> 32:30.483
We're gonna need
some pixie dust too.

32:30.583 --> 32:33.258
I'll get a fairy.
I left my axe downstairs anyway.

32:35.494 --> 32:37.790
Okay, so where are we?

32:37.890 --> 32:40.944
Screwed, possibly.
One thing I'm still not clear about:

32:41.044 --> 32:44.578
If the Titans are roaming around,
why are they killing whitelighters?

32:44.678 --> 32:46.295
Because they need
their orbing power.

32:46.395 --> 32:48.870
Their orbing power? What on
earth would they wanna do with...?

32:50.068 --> 32:51.804
Oh, my God.

32:51.904 --> 32:53.900
Leo!

32:54.419 --> 32:56.635
What did I miss?
What did she just figure out?

32:56.735 --> 32:58.731
Nothing good.

33:05.519 --> 33:07.934
How did you know he was cold?

33:08.034 --> 33:10.030
Babies are what I do.

33:11.068 --> 33:12.526
Leo?

33:12.626 --> 33:14.203
The Titans are after the Elders.

33:14.303 --> 33:15.919
- What?
- You have to go warn them,

33:16.019 --> 33:18.016
but don't stay up there too long.
Hurry.

33:51.354 --> 33:53.350
No!

34:12.355 --> 34:15.070
Now, laddie!

34:17.465 --> 34:19.722
Don't know what else to try.

34:19.822 --> 34:21.598
Running out of gold too, I'm afraid.

34:21.697 --> 34:24.393
Okay, well, there's gotta
be something we can do.

34:24.493 --> 34:26.489
Just keep trying.

34:28.605 --> 34:31.360
- What are you doing over here?
- Nothing.

34:31.759 --> 34:33.695
You guys keep this stuff forever,
you know that?

34:33.795 --> 34:36.150
You knew the Titans were
after the Elders, didn't you?

34:38.626 --> 34:40.243
Why didn't you tell us?

34:40.342 --> 34:42.879
I told you, there's some things
I can't tell you.

34:42.978 --> 34:45.074
Some things you need
to figure out on your own.

34:45.174 --> 34:47.250
Even at the risk
of making things worse?

34:48.128 --> 34:49.824
All right, what's going on?

34:49.925 --> 34:53.619
Leo's not responding to any of my calls
and it's been over five hours.

34:53.719 --> 34:56.572
- I really don't know.
- Well, I really think you do.

34:56.672 --> 34:58.849
Look. You're the one
who wanted him to go up there

34:58.949 --> 35:01.165
in the first place. Not me.

35:01.265 --> 35:03.001
All right, fine. Maybe I do know.

35:03.101 --> 35:05.556
And if I'm right, he's gonna
need some serious alone time.

35:05.656 --> 35:08.471
You know what? Cut it out
with the cryptic crap.

35:08.571 --> 35:11.186
You need to go up there
and bring him back, now.

35:11.286 --> 35:12.544
No more games.

35:12.644 --> 35:14.420
Okay. Fine, I'll go.

35:14.520 --> 35:16.775
But if I were you two,
I'd focus on freeing Paige

35:16.875 --> 35:20.149
because you're
gonna need her, soon.

35:23.504 --> 35:25.719
I swear to God,
if he does not come back with Leo,

35:25.819 --> 35:28.793
I'm gonna blow his ass
back to the future, orbs and all!

35:28.893 --> 35:30.191
You know what?

35:30.291 --> 35:33.984
Why don't you go be with Wyatt, and
I will take care of everything up here.

35:34.084 --> 35:36.179
I will call you
if anything happens, I promise.

35:36.279 --> 35:37.697
- You're not breathing.
- Nope.

35:37.797 --> 35:39.793
Breathe.

35:40.712 --> 35:42.708
Okay, next sister.

35:47.459 --> 35:49.456
Leo?

35:52.050 --> 35:53.507
Why didn't you tell me?

35:53.607 --> 35:55.863
- Why did you let this happen?!
- Easy, easy.

35:55.963 --> 35:58.218
- Why?
- Because this had to happen!

35:58.318 --> 36:00.794
It had to happen so you
could do what has to be done.

36:01.193 --> 36:03.389
What are you talking about?
They're all dead.

36:04.547 --> 36:07.442
- Gone.
- No.

36:07.542 --> 36:09.198
Not all of them.

36:09.298 --> 36:10.955
Some of the Elders
escaped back to Earth,

36:11.055 --> 36:14.409
but it won't be long before
the Titans hunt them down too.

36:15.088 --> 36:17.384
But you can still stop them.

36:17.484 --> 36:19.559
You can still defeat the Titans.

36:20.597 --> 36:22.594
How?

36:23.193 --> 36:25.308
I think you know how.

36:27.824 --> 36:29.821
It's too dangerous.

36:30.179 --> 36:32.196
The Elders forbid it.

36:32.296 --> 36:33.713
True.

36:33.813 --> 36:37.287
But then again, the Elders aren't
around to stop you now, are they?

36:37.965 --> 36:39.463
That's right, Leo.

36:39.563 --> 36:41.419
This is what it's all about.

36:41.519 --> 36:45.352
This is why they had to die, so you
could do something they'd never do.

36:46.549 --> 36:48.905
To save the future for your family.

36:49.464 --> 36:51.460
For your son.

36:52.298 --> 36:54.774
- This is crazy.
- Maybe.

36:55.213 --> 36:56.391
But it's our only chance.

36:56.491 --> 36:59.984
Like it or not, you've been put in
the situation for a reason, Leo.

37:00.084 --> 37:02.060
We both have.

37:02.160 --> 37:04.157
Says you.

37:04.955 --> 37:07.530
How do I know you're not trying
to manipulate this situation

37:07.630 --> 37:09.446
for your own future?

37:09.546 --> 37:12.281
Just the way you've
manipulated everything else.

37:12.381 --> 37:13.959
You don't.

37:14.059 --> 37:16.055
But what choice do you really have?

37:16.494 --> 37:18.970
There's certainly no future
unless you do something.

37:19.688 --> 37:21.685
I don't know.

37:22.403 --> 37:25.138
Even if I were to believe you...

37:25.238 --> 37:27.394
...even if I were willing...

37:28.552 --> 37:30.548
...I couldn't.

37:30.907 --> 37:32.903
I'm no Elder.

37:33.942 --> 37:36.576
Well, you better start acting like one.

37:43.244 --> 37:45.240
Now!

37:48.635 --> 37:50.631
Hit it!

37:54.304 --> 37:57.119
Oh, honey! Hi!

37:57.219 --> 37:59.913
Oh, I'm so happy
to see you. Are you okay?

38:00.013 --> 38:02.448
What happened?
Where's the Titan?

38:03.408 --> 38:05.383
What the hell
are these guys doing here?

38:05.483 --> 38:08.199
Long story, I'll tell you on the way.

38:09.995 --> 38:11.992
You're welcome.

38:13.388 --> 38:15.545
There you are.

38:16.783 --> 38:21.234
Okay, I get the whole epic Titan
thing but what I'm not getting

38:21.334 --> 38:22.711
is the Chris thing.

38:22.811 --> 38:24.428
We're still trying to figure that out.

38:24.528 --> 38:26.783
- Look who's not stoned.
- Welcome back.

38:26.883 --> 38:28.261
You've missed a lot.

38:28.361 --> 38:32.293
Yeah, I can't help but think
it's kind of all my fault.

38:32.393 --> 38:35.967
I mean I'm the one who lured the
Titans here. Insert "I told you so."

38:36.067 --> 38:37.644
Done.

38:37.744 --> 38:42.775
I just kind of was obsessed with
the whole weird dreams thing and...

38:43.253 --> 38:46.826
But I am so sorry for any distress
I might have caused you, Piper.

38:46.926 --> 38:48.504
Don't worry about it.

38:48.604 --> 38:50.699
I should have listened
to you in the first place.

38:50.799 --> 38:54.173
Just trying not to worry, or to panic.

38:54.273 --> 38:57.128
But I've just got this terrible feeling
in the pit of my stomach.

38:57.228 --> 38:59.463
What kind of feeling?

39:01.180 --> 39:03.256
That Leo's not coming back.

39:04.334 --> 39:06.330
Sweetie.

39:06.969 --> 39:09.145
Of course he's coming back.

39:09.245 --> 39:10.942
How could he not?

39:11.042 --> 39:13.378
I don't know, it's just
something that Chris said

39:13.478 --> 39:16.512
about Leo having to
go through this alone.

39:18.189 --> 39:20.185
I don't know.

39:21.942 --> 39:24.377
What the hell is he doing up there?

39:26.453 --> 39:29.208
Sorry to interrupt,
but we're all leaving now.

39:29.847 --> 39:32.242
- Wait. Why?
- Didn't you hear the distress call?

39:32.642 --> 39:36.175
The surviving Elders have all been
flushed out. They need our protection.

39:36.275 --> 39:37.413
"Surviving"?

39:37.513 --> 39:41.426
The elf will stay behind to take care
of the kid while you battle the Titans.

39:43.781 --> 39:47.115
Wait, who said anything
about us battling the Titans?

39:47.215 --> 39:49.211
Leo.

39:50.568 --> 39:52.565
Leo!

39:55.519 --> 39:56.737
- Piper.
- No.

39:56.837 --> 39:58.914
- But she needs me.
- Not as much as the rest of us do.

39:59.632 --> 40:02.587
You need to stay here.
Even afterwards, to coordinate.

40:04.103 --> 40:05.960
All right.

40:06.060 --> 40:08.894
Then you should go.
Otherwise the girls won't understand.

40:10.332 --> 40:12.329
Good luck.

40:42.073 --> 40:43.970
<i>Leo!</i>

40:44.070 --> 40:45.886
<i>Leo!</i>

40:45.986 --> 40:48.901
Leo, for God sakes,
if you can hear me...

40:51.416 --> 40:53.152
You? Where's Leo?

40:53.252 --> 40:55.628
He's safe, for now.

40:55.728 --> 40:58.123
- Paige, hi.
- Hi.

40:58.682 --> 41:00.778
Forget that.
What do you mean, for now?

41:00.878 --> 41:02.655
- What's going on?
- What is this about us

41:02.755 --> 41:04.691
supposedly battling the Titans?

41:04.791 --> 41:06.727
You're about to find out.

41:06.827 --> 41:08.984
What's that supposed to mean?

41:25.672 --> 41:28.008
- That's what that means.
- What happened?

41:28.108 --> 41:30.104
What are we?

41:30.503 --> 41:32.499
You're gods.

41:40.805 --> 41:43.619
You expect us to beat
the Titans dressed like this?

41:43.719 --> 41:45.176
Maybe at a costume party.

41:45.276 --> 41:49.449
That's not a costume, that represents
your new position and power.

41:49.549 --> 41:51.564
- Power?
- Power's good.

41:51.664 --> 41:53.680
I like power.

41:53.780 --> 41:56.795
- Why do I like power?
- Because you are the goddess of war.

41:56.895 --> 41:59.709
Oh, well I guess
that explains the pitchfork.

41:59.809 --> 42:01.985
It's not a pitchfork, it's a trident.

42:02.085 --> 42:03.822
Be careful,
that's a formidable weapon.

42:03.922 --> 42:05.858
Right on.
Who wants to fight?

42:05.958 --> 42:07.695
I'm a lover, not a fighter.

42:07.795 --> 42:10.489
- You're the goddess of love.
- Naturally.

42:10.589 --> 42:12.964
Well, then, that must make
me the goddess of sanity

42:13.064 --> 42:14.921
because I find this ridiculous.

42:15.021 --> 42:18.155
Actually, Leo gave you dominion over
the earth and all its natural elements.

42:18.255 --> 42:20.610
Wait a minute.
You're saying that Leo did this to us?

42:21.090 --> 42:23.945
Chris, you never told us.

42:24.045 --> 42:26.699
Do you have a girlfriend
in the future?

42:26.799 --> 42:30.132
As you can see, all of you have drives
and urges based on your powers.

42:30.232 --> 42:32.569
Don't let them distract you, all right?

42:32.669 --> 42:34.085
Stay focused.

42:34.185 --> 42:35.563
Focused on the Titans.

42:35.663 --> 42:38.598
Hold it, pal! I don't know what
what kind of game you're running here,

42:38.698 --> 42:40.474
but Leo is not
in the god-making business.

42:40.574 --> 42:42.031
How old are you anyway?

42:42.131 --> 42:45.424
The Elders forbid it. And if anything,
Leo is a company man.

42:45.524 --> 42:48.978
The Elders did forbid it.
And guess what? They're dead.

42:49.078 --> 42:50.415
Most of them.

42:50.515 --> 42:52.691
Leo's in charge up there now,
and he's taking a huge risk

42:52.791 --> 42:56.504
that you won't lose your humanity
like the ancient Greek... Whoa!

42:57.622 --> 43:00.077
You killed the Elders,
you could have prevented it.

43:00.177 --> 43:01.595
I say we castrate him.

43:01.695 --> 43:03.710
A little control here, ladies, please?

43:03.810 --> 43:06.406
Can't we figure out
something else to cut off?

43:08.921 --> 43:11.816
I told you, stay focused!

43:11.916 --> 43:14.410
In my future,
all the Elders were killed.

43:14.510 --> 43:17.126
That's why I came back,
to help Leo give you the power

43:17.226 --> 43:19.202
so this would never
have to happen again.

43:19.302 --> 43:21.298
Hey, guys, watch this.

43:24.972 --> 43:27.587
Put that thing down!
You're gonna hurt someone.

43:27.687 --> 43:28.744
I certainly hope so.

43:28.844 --> 43:30.820
Do you know the kind of
damage this thing could do?

43:30.920 --> 43:32.578
- A lot.
- Paige.

43:32.678 --> 43:34.893
Make love, not, you know...

43:34.993 --> 43:37.169
There's no door love can't open.

43:37.269 --> 43:39.205
No wall love can't climb.

43:39.305 --> 43:42.319
No hurdle love can't... hurdle.

43:42.419 --> 43:44.275
This is Leo's strategy?

43:44.375 --> 43:45.793
Well, he must have lost it up there,

43:45.893 --> 43:48.108
because these girls can't
be seen in public, much less...

43:48.208 --> 43:51.183
Oh, that reminds me.
I'm late for the bachelor auction.

43:51.283 --> 43:54.417
I'm gonna go pick up
a guy or two, or 12.

43:54.517 --> 43:56.373
Phoebe!

43:56.473 --> 43:57.571
Oh, that's a good idea.

43:57.671 --> 44:00.685
I'm gonna go get in some
target practice on some demons.

44:00.785 --> 44:02.781
Watch out, Titans.

44:05.217 --> 44:07.872
I knew this was gonna happen.
You gotta go after them.

44:07.972 --> 44:10.667
Oh, no, no, no, this was your
big plan, you clean up the mess.

44:10.767 --> 44:13.262
No, your role is to provide balance.

44:13.362 --> 44:15.538
That's why you feel
so grounded and in control.

44:15.638 --> 44:18.253
Wow, Chris, that was
actually pretty good.

44:18.353 --> 44:21.087
You almost sounded like a whitelighter.
Too bad I already have one.

44:21.187 --> 44:22.804
And if he would like me
to do something,

44:22.904 --> 44:24.720
he can come down
and tell me himself.

44:24.820 --> 44:26.797
Do you hear that?

44:26.897 --> 44:28.893
You want Leo?

44:29.452 --> 44:30.909
Then vanquish the Titans.

44:31.009 --> 44:34.842
If you can't do that, you're gonna find
out what a world of darkness feels like.

44:35.441 --> 44:37.437
My world.

44:46.341 --> 44:48.916
I can sense what's left of the Elders.

44:49.016 --> 44:51.352
They're scared
and running for their lives.

44:51.452 --> 44:54.525
You're still angry with me
for killing her, aren't you?

44:55.603 --> 44:57.181
Demetrius, I'm sorry.

44:57.281 --> 44:59.177
Meta was a distraction.

44:59.277 --> 45:03.010
Once we control the heavens,
you can have any woman you want.

45:03.110 --> 45:05.445
I want you to know
I did what had to be done.

45:05.545 --> 45:07.521
We needed to hit
the Elders hard and fast.

45:07.621 --> 45:09.618
And we did. Right?

45:11.135 --> 45:13.131
Demetrius...

45:13.730 --> 45:16.485
...let's go finish off the Elders.

45:23.233 --> 45:27.464
Ladies, prepare your checkbooks,
because here comes Evan.

45:31.217 --> 45:35.030
Oh, my, my, somebody
turn the heat down in here.

45:35.130 --> 45:37.286
I don't have to take off
my clothes or anything, do I?

45:40.281 --> 45:42.337
That's entirely up to you.

45:42.437 --> 45:45.790
Okay, ladies, Evan's
an internist from Sausalito.

45:46.190 --> 45:50.821
And he promises the highest
bidder a free physical on their date.

45:52.458 --> 45:54.116
So who'll start the bidding?

45:54.216 --> 45:57.429
- Four hundred!
- Excellent, do I hear 500?

45:57.529 --> 46:00.004
One thousand dollars.

46:05.434 --> 46:07.431
Phoebe!

46:14.378 --> 46:17.671
Can I bid on her?

46:17.771 --> 46:20.546
- If you insist.
- That isn't, this isn't, I don't really...

46:20.646 --> 46:23.900
I got a $10,000
limit on my credit card.

46:24.000 --> 46:26.175
- Well, okay then.
- Eleven thousand!

46:26.275 --> 46:27.932
- Twelve thousand.
- Thirteen thousand.

46:28.032 --> 46:29.848
- Fourteen thousand.
- Fourteen-five!

46:29.948 --> 46:31.885
- Fifteen thousand.
- Sixteen thousand.

46:31.985 --> 46:34.201
- Eighteen thousand!
- Easy, boys.

46:34.301 --> 46:37.335
There's plenty to go around.

46:39.691 --> 46:42.167
Come on, now,
hit me with your best shot.

46:50.711 --> 46:56.100
Give me one firm spot on which
to stand, and I will move the Earth.

47:02.129 --> 47:03.986
Archimedes said that.

47:04.086 --> 47:06.980
Great warrior,
and he didn't even have a trident.

47:07.080 --> 47:09.097
Okay, on your knees.

47:09.197 --> 47:10.933
Kiss the hand of the Paige!

47:11.033 --> 47:13.188
Paige, my liege.

47:13.908 --> 47:17.061
Being a goddess
does have its perks.

47:20.335 --> 47:22.552
Paige, what are you doing?

47:22.652 --> 47:23.829
How did you find me?

47:23.929 --> 47:26.663
Apparently it's one of my powers,
to keep an eye on you.

47:26.763 --> 47:28.141
What is going on here?

47:28.241 --> 47:30.416
Oh, I'm just building an army.

47:30.516 --> 47:32.532
I figured, what better way
to smite the Titans

47:32.632 --> 47:34.130
than with hordes of demons, right?

47:34.230 --> 47:35.607
Wrong.

47:35.707 --> 47:36.885
All of you, out!

47:36.985 --> 47:39.101
We answer only to our liege.

47:40.658 --> 47:43.113
- I see.
- See, they're very loyal.

47:43.213 --> 47:47.625
And you know what? I don't know why
I was wasting time studying witchcraft

47:47.725 --> 47:50.680
when I clearly should have been
earning my general's stripes.

47:52.197 --> 47:54.632
I said go, now!

48:01.060 --> 48:03.675
What did you have to do that for?
I had followers.

48:03.775 --> 48:06.190
You can't have followers.
None of us can.

48:06.290 --> 48:09.564
Now come on, before
I unleash my wrath on you.

48:13.437 --> 48:15.474
Not in the house.

48:18.268 --> 48:20.305
Now let's go find Phoebe.

48:21.143 --> 48:24.516
My word, this is a house of ill-repute.

48:24.616 --> 48:26.613
Hardly suitable for an infant.

48:28.409 --> 48:30.146
What do you mean?

48:30.246 --> 48:32.242
How does that feel, Phoebe?

48:35.276 --> 48:38.091
Oh, make sure you
peel those for me, will you?

48:38.191 --> 48:39.529
Yes, of course.

48:39.629 --> 48:42.324
Phoebe, we need to talk.

48:42.424 --> 48:43.920
Yes, we do.

48:44.020 --> 48:46.995
The world would be overflowing
with peace and love

48:47.095 --> 48:49.091
if only we just talked more.

48:49.890 --> 48:51.147
What are they doing here?

48:51.247 --> 48:55.779
Oh, worshipping me,
adoring me, exalting my name.

48:55.879 --> 48:59.392
There is so much love in this room,
I can barely stand it.

49:01.029 --> 49:02.087
Me neither.

49:02.187 --> 49:04.123
It's time to send your
groupies away, now.

49:04.223 --> 49:06.619
But serving me
makes them so happy.

49:09.692 --> 49:12.268
Thank you, bachelor number three.

49:12.368 --> 49:15.063
All right, all of you,
show is over, move along.

49:15.163 --> 49:16.660
We live to serve Phoebe.

49:16.760 --> 49:19.734
Oh you do, don't you?
That's so sweet.

49:19.834 --> 49:22.729
Piper, you need to get
some followers of your own.

49:22.829 --> 49:24.725
It's a really great confidence-builder.

49:24.825 --> 49:26.522
Are you eyeing me, soldier?

49:26.622 --> 49:29.616
What the hell is this?
Goddesses gone wild?

49:30.095 --> 49:33.309
I told you to keep them in line.
What if the Titans attacked now?

49:33.409 --> 49:36.583
Chris, I've got it, thank you.
All of you!

49:36.683 --> 49:38.679
Out!

49:51.176 --> 49:52.992
Now, that's what I'm talking about.

49:53.092 --> 49:54.790
Time for a morality check.

49:54.890 --> 49:59.541
Leo did not give us this power so
we could form armies or love cults.

49:59.641 --> 50:02.415
The ancient Greeks
indulged in their whims that way,

50:02.515 --> 50:03.772
and look what they became.

50:03.872 --> 50:06.607
Petty, evil, vindictive...

50:06.707 --> 50:09.442
Thanks, I've got it. Now.

50:09.542 --> 50:12.197
Hi. Can you two get it under control?

50:12.297 --> 50:15.431
"Reason and judgment
are the qualities of a leader."

50:15.531 --> 50:18.226
Tacitus, 100 A.D.

50:18.326 --> 50:21.779
"Love will keep us together."

50:21.879 --> 50:24.435
Captain and Tennille, 1970s.

50:25.792 --> 50:29.326
Fascinating. Now can we figure
out a way to beat the Titans?

50:29.426 --> 50:32.639
Because I for one would
like my family back soon.

50:32.739 --> 50:33.877
Is that a jingle?

50:33.977 --> 50:36.293
There are no Elders up there.
Who's jingling?

50:37.850 --> 50:39.986
- It's Leo.
- Leo can jingle?

50:40.086 --> 50:43.259
Yep. He says
an Elder's under attack.

50:43.359 --> 50:46.074
Like it or not,
it's time to face the Titans.

50:47.552 --> 50:49.528
Stand back, wise one.

50:49.628 --> 50:51.643
Such bravery in the face of death.

50:51.743 --> 50:53.740
We ain't the ones
that will be dying today.

51:03.882 --> 51:06.536
Remind me when we're through
with the Elders to do something...

51:06.636 --> 51:08.633
...nice for the leprechaun community.

51:09.631 --> 51:12.206
We've beaten you before, Cronus.

51:12.306 --> 51:13.962
- We'll do it again.
- How?

51:14.062 --> 51:18.195
Your numbers are dwindling. By day's
end, the great Elders will all be dead.

51:18.295 --> 51:20.690
And we'll own the heavens.

51:25.481 --> 51:27.477
Who are you?

51:27.837 --> 51:29.833
The Supremes.

51:31.670 --> 51:34.265
- She wields the powers of the gods!
- Just kill the Elder.

51:39.136 --> 51:40.832
Somebody get the Elder out.

51:40.932 --> 51:42.929
- I can't. I can't move.
- Me neither.

51:43.847 --> 51:45.843
Leo!

51:51.154 --> 51:53.150
Where did they go?

52:12.195 --> 52:15.289
- Everybody okay?
- No. Is my hair singed?

52:15.389 --> 52:16.686
You're fine.

52:16.786 --> 52:19.721
I guess we're not so
all-powerful after all.

52:19.821 --> 52:22.835
- How did we get out of there?
- I guess Leo must have orbed us out.

52:22.935 --> 52:25.710
But I don't know how.
He doesn't have that kind of power.

52:25.810 --> 52:27.906
Well, he must have
because we're out of there.

52:28.006 --> 52:30.481
What is this place, a sewer?

52:32.078 --> 52:34.912
This is... sanctuary.

52:35.951 --> 52:38.327
Oh, my, my, my.

52:38.427 --> 52:41.161
Aren't you just the edible Elder.

52:41.261 --> 52:43.896
Have you taken a vow of celibacy?

52:44.774 --> 52:47.949
- Phoebe, stay on target.
- Right.

52:48.049 --> 52:49.905
What do you mean, this is sanctuary?

52:50.005 --> 52:51.142
It's a safe house...

52:51.242 --> 52:53.019
...set up by Leo to protect the Elders.

52:53.119 --> 52:54.856
Well, it doesn't look so safe to me.

52:54.956 --> 52:57.131
I can see unprotected
points of entry all over the place.

52:57.231 --> 53:00.126
Don't worry.
The Titans can't sense our location.

53:00.226 --> 53:02.542
We're hidden from them
by a web of fairy magic.

53:03.620 --> 53:05.715
Another of Leo's ideas.

53:05.815 --> 53:08.790
- Leo did all this?
- I was surprised myself.

53:08.890 --> 53:11.784
I'm afraid I'm one of the Elders
who always sold Leo short.

53:11.884 --> 53:15.059
What with him
marrying a witch and all.

53:15.159 --> 53:17.294
- No offence.
- Offence taken.

53:17.394 --> 53:19.810
I will never make that mistake again.

53:19.910 --> 53:21.806
Without Leo, we'd all be dead.

53:21.906 --> 53:26.078
He's out there now tracking Elders
as we speak, moving them here.

53:26.178 --> 53:29.092
- We owe Leo everything.
- I guess so.

53:30.490 --> 53:32.665
Well, good luck with the Titans.

53:32.765 --> 53:34.762
One more question:

53:35.321 --> 53:37.318
What are you wearing
under that robe?

53:38.395 --> 53:40.531
More robes.

53:40.631 --> 53:42.627
Oh, that is so hot.

53:45.023 --> 53:46.400
This is getting tired.

53:46.500 --> 53:48.357
A warrior preparing for battle
cannot be weary.

53:48.457 --> 53:51.271
No, I'm tired of getting all
this information second-hand.

53:51.371 --> 53:52.708
I would like to hear it from Leo.

53:52.808 --> 53:56.821
Piper, I'm sensing a blockage
in your spiritual energy.

53:56.921 --> 54:00.015
- What's wrong, sweetie?
- I need to talk to my husband.

54:00.115 --> 54:04.527
I appreciate him becoming a magical
folk hero for the masses and all,

54:04.627 --> 54:07.042
I really do.
But enough is enough.

54:07.142 --> 54:08.439
Leo!

54:08.539 --> 54:11.174
Remember me, your wife?

54:11.894 --> 54:15.067
Don't you jingle me!
I need more than a jingle here, mister!

54:15.167 --> 54:18.161
You will get down here right now!

54:28.942 --> 54:31.237
Are you trying to alert the enemy?

54:31.337 --> 54:35.469
Piper, I'm sure as soon as Leo
figures out how angry you are

54:35.569 --> 54:38.124
he's gonna come
running down here.

54:42.557 --> 54:45.710
Okay, you can come running now.

54:46.908 --> 54:49.324
Look, sweetie,
it's not like he's not busy.

54:49.424 --> 54:51.041
He's saving the world.

54:51.141 --> 54:53.077
And buying us time
to vanquish the Titans,

54:53.177 --> 54:55.672
although I don't know where
we're gonna get the strength from.

54:55.772 --> 54:58.766
- They had no problem with my power.
- Then let's try my power.

55:05.314 --> 55:07.670
I've been waiting for you...

55:10.145 --> 55:12.780
...my whole life.
- You have?

55:14.018 --> 55:15.236
Why?

55:15.336 --> 55:17.332
Why?

55:18.171 --> 55:19.587
It doesn't matter.

55:19.687 --> 55:25.118
The only thing that matters
is that you're here, and I'm here.

55:25.677 --> 55:28.012
- Do you know what that means?
- We're here?

55:28.112 --> 55:29.689
Right.

55:29.789 --> 55:31.686
Together.

55:31.786 --> 55:34.999
- Do you want me?
- Very much.

55:35.099 --> 55:37.275
I'm all yours.

55:37.375 --> 55:40.190
But wait, what would Cronus think?

55:40.290 --> 55:42.665
I don't care what Cronus thinks.

55:42.765 --> 55:45.659
If he tries to stop me, I'll just...

55:45.759 --> 55:48.095
What are you doing, Demetrius?

55:48.195 --> 55:50.590
The goddess wants to seduce me.

55:51.588 --> 55:53.585
I was just playing along
till you got here.

55:54.263 --> 55:56.420
Phooey!

55:58.656 --> 56:01.231
End war game.

56:01.331 --> 56:05.183
- My way didn't work.
- Nothing's working. I need a break.

56:05.283 --> 56:07.618
How did the Greeks do it?

56:07.718 --> 56:10.533
Well, for one thing,
there were more of them.

56:10.633 --> 56:12.529
Like an entire
mountaintop full of them,

56:12.629 --> 56:14.127
until their powers consumed them.

56:14.227 --> 56:16.004
Maybe declaring themselves gods

56:16.104 --> 56:18.459
gave them strength
to defeat the Titans.

56:19.297 --> 56:22.611
- I'd rather be flayed alive.
- Not an option for me.

56:24.128 --> 56:26.184
God...

56:26.284 --> 56:28.281
I miss Leo.

56:28.759 --> 56:30.815
Leo?

56:30.915 --> 56:34.190
- Oh, it's just you.
- Hello to you too.

56:35.028 --> 56:37.383
So the Elders are taken care of.

56:38.183 --> 56:40.977
- Where's Piper?
- She's upstairs with the baby.

56:42.494 --> 56:45.069
- Could you bring us Leo?
- He's busy.

56:45.169 --> 56:47.065
- How's it going here?
- Not so good.

56:47.165 --> 56:49.701
I keep trying to come up
with a plan to defeat the Titans,

56:49.801 --> 56:51.378
but every simulation
ends the same way.

56:51.478 --> 56:53.494
With our death.

56:53.594 --> 56:55.569
We could really use
Leo right about now.

56:55.669 --> 56:57.127
I'm starting to get
that impression.

56:57.227 --> 57:00.440
- Could you bring him back?
- For the last time, no.

57:00.540 --> 57:02.278
What is wrong with you two, huh?

57:02.378 --> 57:04.553
- You're acting hopeless.
- I don't know.

57:04.653 --> 57:07.528
I guess I always feel like this
right before a big battle.

57:07.887 --> 57:12.578
And then Leo comes down,
and I don't know how he does it...

57:12.678 --> 57:15.773
...but he makes me feel like
I have the power to do anything.

57:15.873 --> 57:17.808
Really?
It's different for me.

57:17.908 --> 57:20.843
It's like I forget that I even
have any training and I,

57:20.943 --> 57:25.075
and I can't concentrate. But Leo
helps me focus and calm down.

57:25.175 --> 57:27.590
You know, I'm starting to think
that we take Leo for granted.

57:27.690 --> 57:29.148
Are you sure
that you can't get him?

57:29.248 --> 57:31.223
Leo is up there, okay?

57:31.323 --> 57:33.899
And he's gotta stay up there until...
You know what?

57:33.999 --> 57:36.014
I'm not gonna go over this again.

57:36.114 --> 57:38.530
What can I do to get you two
over the hump here?

57:38.630 --> 57:41.045
Try saying this,
it always works for Leo:

57:41.145 --> 57:44.280
"Your power comes
from your emotions."

57:44.380 --> 57:47.593
Or what about this?
"Trust the power of three."

57:47.693 --> 57:48.911
Or how about this one?

57:49.011 --> 57:50.548
"I'm gonna go
check with the Elders."

57:50.648 --> 57:53.024
Do you actually think
he checks with the Elders?

57:53.124 --> 57:55.698
No. He probably
just orbs to a sports bar

57:55.798 --> 57:59.491
and buys his buddies rounds of drinks.
"My wife thinks I'm up there.

57:59.591 --> 58:01.588
Here's to the Elders."

58:02.786 --> 58:04.782
You really are helpless without him.

58:09.014 --> 58:11.450
Somebody's still alive up here.

58:12.767 --> 58:14.703
We don't know that, Cronus.

58:14.803 --> 58:16.579
Maybe the world's magic
has increased

58:16.679 --> 58:18.337
since we were frozen in that...

58:18.437 --> 58:19.534
Demetrius!

58:19.634 --> 58:22.130
The trident, she had the trident.

58:22.230 --> 58:24.245
The Greek gods have been
re-created, which means

58:24.345 --> 58:26.841
somebody up here released
their essence as mortals.

58:26.941 --> 58:30.634
Which means
somebody is still up here.

58:30.734 --> 58:33.669
If you're right, and the
gods have been re-created,

58:33.769 --> 58:36.902
then we should be after them now
before their powers grow too strong.

58:37.002 --> 58:38.460
No.

58:38.560 --> 58:40.855
Whoever's up here
will just create new gods.

58:40.955 --> 58:43.629
That threat must be dealt with now.

58:45.986 --> 58:49.439
- I am sensing something.
- Where?

58:49.539 --> 58:51.535
It's faint.

58:54.689 --> 58:56.686
There.

58:57.244 --> 59:02.495
Whoever created these gods,
whoever is hiding, they're trapped.

59:02.595 --> 59:06.048
They can't dematerialize
without exposing themselves to us.

59:06.148 --> 59:09.383
There's only so many
places up here they can hide.

59:14.134 --> 59:15.950
I could have sworn...

59:16.050 --> 59:18.046
I don't see anything.

59:21.440 --> 59:23.516
Keep looking.

59:30.104 --> 59:33.617
I know you miss him.
I miss him too.

59:34.376 --> 59:36.373
I need help.

59:38.089 --> 59:39.826
Excuse me.

59:39.926 --> 59:42.900
This is my bedroom, you can't
just walk in here anytime you want to.

59:43.000 --> 59:45.415
Yeah, I know.
But your sisters need you.

59:45.515 --> 59:49.008
I got them working on the Titans but I
don't know how long that's gonna last.

59:49.108 --> 59:53.680
- I thought you needed me.
- I did. I mean, I do.

59:53.780 --> 59:56.155
I need you because they need you.
Actually, they need Leo.

59:56.255 --> 59:58.352
Look, will you please
just go deal with them?

59:58.452 --> 01:00:01.585
What's the matter? Chris, the
all-knowing, running out of answers?

01:00:01.685 --> 01:00:03.183
Yes, yes I am.

01:00:03.283 --> 01:00:05.498
If that will motivate you,
yes, I'm losing control.

01:00:05.598 --> 01:00:08.852
I'm watching history repeat itself and
nobody's doing a damn thing about it!

01:00:08.952 --> 01:00:10.948
I feel your frustration.

01:00:14.022 --> 01:00:18.833
Piper, if it helps, I get it. Okay? I do.

01:00:18.933 --> 01:00:20.989
Really. You need Leo.

01:00:21.089 --> 01:00:22.666
Your sisters need Leo.

01:00:22.766 --> 01:00:25.062
- But if you can't stop...
- You forgot the baby.

01:00:25.162 --> 01:00:26.459
The baby needs his father too.

01:00:26.559 --> 01:00:28.455
Fine. But if you can't stop
missing your husband

01:00:28.555 --> 01:00:30.292
long enough to see
the bigger picture...

01:00:30.392 --> 01:00:32.129
There is no bigger picture
than my family.

01:00:32.229 --> 01:00:34.484
Well, then, pay attention,
because the world I grew up in,

01:00:34.584 --> 01:00:37.559
families hardly existed.
I never had a chance to know mine.

01:00:37.659 --> 01:00:39.655
- Not my fault.
- Not yet.

01:00:40.533 --> 01:00:41.751
Is that what this is about?

01:00:41.851 --> 01:00:43.787
You blame us
for what happened to you?

01:00:43.887 --> 01:00:46.023
I just want you
to get it right this time.

01:00:46.123 --> 01:00:47.859
Use your power of three.

01:00:47.959 --> 01:00:49.696
Use your power as gods.

01:00:49.796 --> 01:00:51.792
Save the world from going to hell.

01:00:52.830 --> 01:00:55.046
If that's what you want,
then I will say it one more time,

01:00:55.146 --> 01:00:56.523
and maybe you will hear me.

01:00:56.623 --> 01:00:58.480
We need Leo.

01:00:58.580 --> 01:01:02.014
Now, excuse me,
I have to go warm up a bottle.

01:01:13.393 --> 01:01:15.469
Don't worry.
You'll come to trust me in time.

01:01:17.226 --> 01:01:19.222
They all will.

01:01:30.960 --> 01:01:32.936
What are you doing?
You're gonna expose us!

01:01:33.036 --> 01:01:34.334
That's the idea.

01:01:34.434 --> 01:01:36.490
Did you sense that?

01:01:36.590 --> 01:01:38.586
Someone orbed.

01:01:44.774 --> 01:01:47.010
Hurry, go. Piper needs you.

01:01:59.347 --> 01:02:02.182
Leo, how could you leave us?

01:02:06.135 --> 01:02:08.211
Who are you?

01:02:09.329 --> 01:02:10.706
Hi, Piper.

01:02:10.806 --> 01:02:12.922
You're home.

01:02:17.354 --> 01:02:18.891
You heard my calls, right?

01:02:18.991 --> 01:02:20.088
Of course I did, honey.

01:02:20.188 --> 01:02:21.886
But I had to make sure
the Elders were safe,

01:02:21.986 --> 01:02:23.682
and then I was cornered
by the Titans.

01:02:23.782 --> 01:02:26.876
I'm just thankful you're okay.
My mind was just racing.

01:02:26.976 --> 01:02:28.972
I know, I felt it.

01:02:29.970 --> 01:02:33.265
- Good thing Chris came when he did.
- Chris?

01:02:33.365 --> 01:02:35.500
He distracted the Titans
so I could escape.

01:02:35.600 --> 01:02:39.612
Right now they're probably following
his orb trail, so we don't have...

01:02:39.712 --> 01:02:41.010
What's wrong with your hair?

01:02:41.110 --> 01:02:42.927
What?

01:02:43.027 --> 01:02:45.043
It's white.

01:02:45.143 --> 01:02:47.138
Is it?

01:02:50.133 --> 01:02:53.467
Wow, must be from
staying up there for so long.

01:02:53.567 --> 01:02:55.064
I guess so.

01:02:55.164 --> 01:02:56.860
Where are your sisters?

01:02:56.960 --> 01:02:59.296
Well, they can wait a minute
while we spend some time alone.

01:02:59.396 --> 01:03:01.213
And then you need to hold your son.

01:03:01.313 --> 01:03:03.508
Spoken like a true earth goddess.

01:03:04.347 --> 01:03:05.604
What are you talking about?

01:03:05.704 --> 01:03:08.759
You need to channel your hearth
and home instincts to fight the Titans.

01:03:08.859 --> 01:03:11.673
Leo, I was speaking
from the heart, not the hearth.

01:03:11.773 --> 01:03:13.910
Hi, I'm your wife. Remember?

01:03:14.010 --> 01:03:17.383
I do. But Chris can only
throw off the Titans for so long.

01:03:17.483 --> 01:03:19.179
We need to be ready
with a battle plan.

01:03:19.279 --> 01:03:21.276
Now let's find your sisters.

01:03:24.350 --> 01:03:26.965
Ma'am, I was just coming
to check on the baby.

01:03:27.065 --> 01:03:30.858
That's okay, because
he's actually sleeping so...

01:03:32.375 --> 01:03:35.130
Welcome, wise one.

01:03:36.927 --> 01:03:40.540
Oh, no, this is just my husband.
He's not an Elder.

01:03:40.640 --> 01:03:42.895
He's just wearing
this robe because...

01:03:42.995 --> 01:03:44.732
Why are you wearing this robe?

01:03:44.832 --> 01:03:46.728
It was windy up there.

01:03:46.828 --> 01:03:48.924
See? So you can take a break
because, you know,

01:03:49.024 --> 01:03:51.020
Wyatt's asleep and...

01:03:53.815 --> 01:03:55.811
Okay, here we go.

01:04:00.244 --> 01:04:03.337
It says in there that Cronus
swallowed his newborn children

01:04:03.437 --> 01:04:06.372
to keep them from overthrowing him.

01:04:06.472 --> 01:04:10.365
What if you lure the Titans to a field,
Piper lifts them with a tornado,

01:04:10.465 --> 01:04:13.079
and I hit them with my lightning?

01:04:13.179 --> 01:04:16.154
I'm afraid there's no way to beat a man
who eats his own children.

01:04:16.254 --> 01:04:18.230
- Those stories are fables.
- Leo!

01:04:18.330 --> 01:04:20.327
Welcome home, Leo.

01:04:21.325 --> 01:04:22.382
What do you have for me?

01:04:22.482 --> 01:04:25.376
Paige ran every battle plan she knows,
which as a war goddess

01:04:25.476 --> 01:04:29.010
is basically every battle
that's ever been fought.

01:04:29.110 --> 01:04:31.525
No matter how you spin it,

01:04:31.625 --> 01:04:34.839
warrior, seductress, earth mother,

01:04:34.939 --> 01:04:36.995
we don't have the power
to defeat the Titans.

01:04:37.095 --> 01:04:40.029
We can't beat them.
They're too strong for us.

01:04:40.129 --> 01:04:42.984
See how much
this family needs you?

01:04:43.084 --> 01:04:44.461
No.

01:04:44.561 --> 01:04:46.377
I don't.

01:04:46.477 --> 01:04:48.773
You can do this without me.

01:04:48.873 --> 01:04:52.546
And it's not because you have the
power of gods or the power of three.

01:04:53.664 --> 01:04:55.002
It's because

01:04:55.102 --> 01:04:58.296
you're the greatest force of good that
I know, and that's why I chose you.

01:04:59.134 --> 01:05:02.508
Oh, see? I can just feel
the confidence wash all over me.

01:05:02.608 --> 01:05:04.843
- He's doing it.
- What is he doing?

01:05:05.283 --> 01:05:08.158
Paige, you know exactly where to
find the power to conquer the Titans.

01:05:08.477 --> 01:05:12.350
- I do?
- Yes, you just need to focus.

01:05:16.143 --> 01:05:20.455
- We have to declare ourselves gods.
- That's how the ancient Greeks did it.

01:05:21.014 --> 01:05:22.711
Chris told us not to do that.

01:05:22.811 --> 01:05:24.068
Well, Chris is wrong.

01:05:24.168 --> 01:05:25.346
He doesn't know you like I do.

01:05:25.446 --> 01:05:28.300
But, Leo, the ancient Greeks
lost their humanity.

01:05:28.400 --> 01:05:30.855
You're not the ancient Greeks.

01:05:30.955 --> 01:05:32.951
You're the Charmed Ones.

01:05:34.309 --> 01:05:38.002
I didn't give you
anything you can't handle.

01:05:38.102 --> 01:05:41.755
Phoebe, you lost yourself to
the darkest love that ever existed,

01:05:41.855 --> 01:05:43.752
and you came back.

01:05:43.852 --> 01:05:46.986
Of course you can handle
being the goddess of love.

01:05:47.086 --> 01:05:48.862
I never thought of it that way.

01:05:48.962 --> 01:05:51.297
Paige, you're the goddess of war
because you've been consumed

01:05:51.397 --> 01:05:54.392
with gaining power, but you've never
let the power consume you.

01:05:55.909 --> 01:05:57.905
Piper...

01:05:58.903 --> 01:06:01.219
...is it any wonder I made you
the goddess of earth?

01:06:02.338 --> 01:06:06.809
You are everything that is
good and beautiful in this world.

01:06:07.328 --> 01:06:09.324
The mother of my son.

01:06:10.442 --> 01:06:12.458
You really have
that much faith in us?

01:06:12.558 --> 01:06:14.555
Do you really even need to ask that?

01:06:15.433 --> 01:06:18.208
It's like I've always said,
your power comes from your emotion.

01:06:18.308 --> 01:06:22.240
And right now you need to
dig deeper than you ever have before.

01:06:22.340 --> 01:06:25.115
Whatever motivates you,
your heart, your soul,

01:06:25.215 --> 01:06:28.269
your darkest fears, whatever it takes.
You need to find that

01:06:28.369 --> 01:06:30.545
and channel it into power.

01:06:30.645 --> 01:06:33.020
Power, not to capture the Titans,

01:06:33.120 --> 01:06:35.336
but to destroy them.

01:06:35.436 --> 01:06:37.432
Forever.

01:06:42.383 --> 01:06:44.379
Leo?

01:06:46.136 --> 01:06:48.292
What's happening to me?

01:07:00.071 --> 01:07:01.567
He's not here.

01:07:01.667 --> 01:07:03.763
Another dead end.

01:07:03.863 --> 01:07:05.120
No.

01:07:05.220 --> 01:07:07.915
The orb trail's getting stronger.

01:07:08.015 --> 01:07:10.351
We're getting closer.

01:07:10.451 --> 01:07:12.448
We'll push ahead.

01:07:12.767 --> 01:07:14.803
Wait, wait.

01:07:15.282 --> 01:07:17.338
Do you sense that?

01:07:17.438 --> 01:07:19.714
An Elder out in the open.

01:07:20.672 --> 01:07:22.908
Do you think it's our target?

01:07:23.427 --> 01:07:25.903
There's only one way to find out.

01:07:28.897 --> 01:07:30.714
I'll never leave you.

01:07:30.814 --> 01:07:32.890
I promise.

01:07:33.608 --> 01:07:35.605
Why would you?

01:07:36.363 --> 01:07:39.298
- Leo, what's going on?
- I'm not sure.

01:07:39.398 --> 01:07:41.394
What do you mean you're not sure?

01:07:42.791 --> 01:07:46.744
Chris, wherever you are,
get your ass over here!

01:07:47.862 --> 01:07:49.858
It's okay, Chris.

01:07:51.136 --> 01:07:52.473
This better be an emergency.

01:07:52.573 --> 01:07:55.467
You are gonna lead the Titans
straight to us.

01:07:55.567 --> 01:07:57.024
What's happening to my husband?

01:07:57.124 --> 01:07:58.262
Something amazing.

01:07:58.362 --> 01:07:59.860
You know what? Cut the crap!

01:07:59.960 --> 01:08:02.774
You knew the Elders were gonna die.
You coached Leo up there.

01:08:02.874 --> 01:08:04.810
You knew all of this
was gonna happen.

01:08:04.910 --> 01:08:07.386
- Did you?
- You're not serious.

01:08:07.904 --> 01:08:10.959
Whatever it is you think you're doing,
you need to make it stop.

01:08:11.059 --> 01:08:13.674
Piper, nobody chose this.
It chose Leo.

01:08:13.774 --> 01:08:16.768
What he did up there, for all of us,
was nothing short of a miracle.

01:08:17.487 --> 01:08:19.622
Now he's receiving
the ultimate reward.

01:08:19.723 --> 01:08:22.438
- A chance to become an...
- Don't you dare say it!

01:08:22.756 --> 01:08:24.913
The world needs sources of good
to watch over it.

01:08:25.992 --> 01:08:28.984
Do you know a source
of pure goodness better than Leo?

01:08:31.819 --> 01:08:33.756
Leo is not...

01:08:33.856 --> 01:08:35.553
He's not an Elder, okay?

01:08:35.653 --> 01:08:38.587
Because Elders don't live on Earth.
They don't have families, okay?

01:08:38.687 --> 01:08:40.844
Just tell him you're not an Elder.

01:08:42.760 --> 01:08:44.756
I don't know that I can.

01:08:45.395 --> 01:08:47.390
I think you should
get back to your sisters.

01:08:48.469 --> 01:08:50.645
No. Not until you tell him.

01:08:50.746 --> 01:08:51.804
They're waiting for you.

01:08:51.904 --> 01:08:54.118
Chris is right. You need to get back
to Paige and Phoebe.

01:08:54.219 --> 01:08:55.915
No. Not until you say it.

01:08:56.015 --> 01:08:57.992
The Titans are
gonna be here any moment.

01:08:58.091 --> 01:09:00.087
I said no!

01:09:06.077 --> 01:09:08.073
He'll be okay.

01:09:10.069 --> 01:09:12.165
You did it, Piper.

01:09:12.265 --> 01:09:14.441
You found your power.

01:09:14.541 --> 01:09:16.977
Now control it.
Don't let it control you.

01:09:17.814 --> 01:09:19.812
Piper!

01:09:23.962 --> 01:09:26.040
Where is the Elder
who created you?

01:09:42.090 --> 01:09:44.326
It's not nice
to piss off Mother Nature.

01:10:15.668 --> 01:10:18.463
- So much for the Titans.
- Thank God.

01:10:19.062 --> 01:10:21.058
You're welcome.

01:10:25.449 --> 01:10:27.586
You did it, Piper.

01:10:27.686 --> 01:10:30.141
You found the power you needed.

01:10:30.241 --> 01:10:32.237
You all did.

01:10:32.876 --> 01:10:34.873
Now it's time to give it back.

01:10:51.761 --> 01:10:52.899
Are you ready?

01:10:52.999 --> 01:10:55.394
Just get it out of me.

01:11:02.501 --> 01:11:04.638
How do you feel?

01:11:04.738 --> 01:11:06.734
Free.

01:11:07.212 --> 01:11:08.470
Anything on Piper?

01:11:08.570 --> 01:11:11.365
- Nope, I still can't get a read.
- Just keep trying.

01:11:11.964 --> 01:11:15.018
Okay, even if we do find her,
how are we gonna get her back?

01:11:15.118 --> 01:11:17.733
She's on this major power trip.
She destroyed the Titans.

01:11:17.833 --> 01:11:19.689
Not even the Greek gods
could do that.

01:11:19.789 --> 01:11:22.544
We just gotta hope she has
some humanity still left inside.

01:11:23.182 --> 01:11:25.778
If anyone can come back
from this, it's Piper.

01:11:26.537 --> 01:11:27.835
I've gotta go now.

01:11:27.935 --> 01:11:30.509
If you need me,
Chris knows how to get in touch.

01:11:30.609 --> 01:11:32.146
Where are you going?

01:11:32.246 --> 01:11:34.961
The Elders have returned
to the heavens, and they're calling me.

01:11:37.756 --> 01:11:40.610
Did he just bail on us?
Is that what he did?

01:11:40.710 --> 01:11:42.886
What about, you know,
helping us find his wife?

01:11:42.986 --> 01:11:44.323
He's trusting in you to do that.

01:11:44.423 --> 01:11:46.041
You need to find Piper
and talk her down

01:11:46.141 --> 01:11:49.514
before she sets up shop somewhere
and throws the world into chaos.

01:11:49.614 --> 01:11:50.832
Then it'll be too late for her.

01:11:50.932 --> 01:11:54.265
Okay, maybe you missed the part
about Piper being Leo's wife.

01:11:54.365 --> 01:11:57.320
Look, you have to understand.
Things have changed.

01:11:57.799 --> 01:11:59.875
The Elders need Leo up there
to help restore order.

01:12:01.991 --> 01:12:03.169
Cut to the chase, future man.

01:12:03.269 --> 01:12:05.584
Is this about Leo being
turned into an Elder, or what?

01:12:06.622 --> 01:12:07.840
He's on the path.

01:12:07.940 --> 01:12:11.273
Okay, don't give us
that creepy pod-people smile.

01:12:11.373 --> 01:12:13.549
Okay, in your world
being an Elder may be cool,

01:12:13.649 --> 01:12:15.866
but in our world,
it pretty much sucks.

01:12:15.966 --> 01:12:17.542
Leo is our brother-in-law.

01:12:17.642 --> 01:12:19.299
- And our whitelighter.
- And our friend.

01:12:19.399 --> 01:12:20.737
And we don't want to lose him.

01:12:20.837 --> 01:12:23.032
So listen,
you go up there and tell Leo...

01:12:27.584 --> 01:12:30.019
What is going on with this storm?

01:12:31.856 --> 01:12:33.912
Piper.

01:12:34.012 --> 01:12:36.467
- Piper's what's up with the storm.
- What do you mean?

01:12:36.567 --> 01:12:38.303
Remember when the Titans
were first released?

01:12:38.403 --> 01:12:40.180
The major weather shifts
and the earthquake?

01:12:40.280 --> 01:12:42.296
- Yeah.
- When you have power over the earth

01:12:42.396 --> 01:12:44.991
like the Titans did, it's bound
to suffer your emotional baggage.

01:12:45.989 --> 01:12:49.543
And, like Leo says, our power
comes from our emotions.

01:12:50.461 --> 01:12:51.599
Okay.

01:12:51.699 --> 01:12:55.073
Okay, so if you're a god,
and you're angry,

01:12:55.173 --> 01:12:59.245
and you're taking it out on the city,
where would you go?

01:12:59.724 --> 01:13:03.757
Somewhere high where I could
enjoy the damage I'm inflicting.

01:13:22.921 --> 01:13:24.658
Piper!

01:13:24.758 --> 01:13:26.175
Stay away from me.

01:13:26.275 --> 01:13:29.429
- We're taking you home.
- To your family.

01:13:31.186 --> 01:13:33.302
What family?

01:13:34.660 --> 01:13:36.856
To your son, Wyatt!

01:13:37.254 --> 01:13:39.690
- Remember him?
- He needs his mother.

01:13:40.009 --> 01:13:43.363
He already lost his father, don't take
his mother away from him too.

01:13:59.933 --> 01:14:01.270
Where is he?

01:14:01.370 --> 01:14:03.366
Where is Leo?

01:14:04.844 --> 01:14:06.739
Piper, what are you doing here?

01:14:06.839 --> 01:14:09.315
How can you do this?

01:14:10.473 --> 01:14:12.590
Excuse us for a minute.

01:14:21.492 --> 01:14:26.223
You asked me to marry you,
and I did.

01:14:26.323 --> 01:14:29.618
You wanted a family,
and I gave you a son.

01:14:29.718 --> 01:14:33.591
And now you want me
to watch you just walk away?

01:14:34.669 --> 01:14:35.926
It's not that simple.

01:14:36.026 --> 01:14:37.283
Then make it simple.

01:14:37.383 --> 01:14:39.978
Because I'm trying
really hard to understand.

01:14:40.298 --> 01:14:44.590
Piper, if I had a choice
in any of this, I would choose you.

01:14:44.690 --> 01:14:46.546
I always have.

01:14:46.646 --> 01:14:48.882
Then choose me now...

01:14:49.201 --> 01:14:51.197
...and let's go home.

01:14:52.675 --> 01:14:54.671
Don't you think I want to?

01:14:55.909 --> 01:14:57.905
I don't know.

01:14:59.103 --> 01:15:01.938
And that's what scares me the most.

01:15:03.694 --> 01:15:05.790
The Elders were wrong about us.

01:15:05.890 --> 01:15:09.245
They didn't think
our love could survive, but it did.

01:15:10.283 --> 01:15:14.614
Our love blessed us
in ways they couldn't even imagine.

01:15:14.714 --> 01:15:18.487
It gave you the strength
that you needed to take over for Prue.

01:15:18.587 --> 01:15:23.398
It produced a baby
with a greater future than any of us.

01:15:23.498 --> 01:15:25.494
And it made me...

01:15:27.769 --> 01:15:29.766
An Elder.

01:15:31.682 --> 01:15:34.777
Our love is transcendent, Piper.

01:15:34.877 --> 01:15:40.766
It lifted me up so high
that this was the only possible result.

01:15:40.866 --> 01:15:43.860
Being an Elder wasn't my destiny.

01:15:44.259 --> 01:15:46.655
But yet, here I am because of you.

01:15:49.170 --> 01:15:52.304
I can't just give up.

01:15:52.404 --> 01:15:54.720
I don't know how.

01:15:55.319 --> 01:15:57.515
You can't fight this.

01:15:58.034 --> 01:16:00.030
Not this.

01:16:18.995 --> 01:16:21.251
How am I supposed to do this alone?

01:16:21.351 --> 01:16:23.347
You have your sisters.

01:16:23.986 --> 01:16:25.982
It's not the same.

01:16:28.937 --> 01:16:30.933
Will I ever see you again?

01:16:32.890 --> 01:16:34.886
I don't know.

01:16:36.123 --> 01:16:38.279
I'll always be watching over you.

01:16:39.837 --> 01:16:42.272
But you won't be there for Wyatt.

01:16:43.230 --> 01:16:45.865
You're gonna miss so much.

01:16:47.503 --> 01:16:49.499
I will never leave Wyatt's side.

01:16:51.494 --> 01:16:54.489
He will always feel my presence.

01:16:55.447 --> 01:16:58.562
It's not the same as human love.

01:16:59.161 --> 01:17:01.157
He needs you for that.

01:17:02.994 --> 01:17:05.109
He's got me.

01:17:06.867 --> 01:17:09.662
And I hope that that's enough.

01:17:10.220 --> 01:17:12.895
But what if it's not?

01:17:19.762 --> 01:17:22.277
As an Elder, I have the power
to take your pain away.

01:17:25.113 --> 01:17:27.608
You can't make me forget you.

01:17:27.708 --> 01:17:29.704
No...

01:17:31.221 --> 01:17:33.257
...help you find peace.

01:18:28.076 --> 01:18:29.612
I know, Elise.

01:18:29.712 --> 01:18:33.047
Yeah, it really was a great costume.

01:18:33.147 --> 01:18:36.121
I'm just glad that the night
was a success.

01:18:36.221 --> 01:18:38.197
Okay. You too.

01:18:38.297 --> 01:18:40.034
Bye.

01:18:40.134 --> 01:18:45.284
Well, I managed to raise $18,000 for
the Bay Mirror Children's Foundation.

01:18:46.242 --> 01:18:48.778
Gotta admit,
being a goddess did have its perks.

01:18:48.878 --> 01:18:51.713
I even got a second date with Evan.

01:18:52.391 --> 01:18:54.247
What's Jason gonna think?

01:18:54.347 --> 01:18:56.124
You know, I miss Jason. I really do.

01:18:56.224 --> 01:18:58.320
But I can't put my life
on hold for him.

01:18:58.420 --> 01:19:00.515
You know, if he comes back
to San Francisco,

01:19:00.615 --> 01:19:02.552
then we'll give it another shot.

01:19:02.652 --> 01:19:05.008
How about you?
You miss being a warrior princess?

01:19:05.686 --> 01:19:09.499
No, I do not miss
being a warrior princess.

01:19:09.599 --> 01:19:12.953
In fact, I don't even think
I'm gonna miss being super-witch.

01:19:13.472 --> 01:19:14.570
What do you mean?

01:19:14.670 --> 01:19:19.561
I've been on this crazy
magic journey for so long now, I...

01:19:19.661 --> 01:19:21.836
I just think it's time to
slow down a bit, you know.

01:19:21.936 --> 01:19:25.549
I've kind of let my career slide,
let my friends slide.

01:19:25.649 --> 01:19:27.925
I think I'm just tired
and I need a break.

01:19:29.522 --> 01:19:31.518
You got it?

01:19:32.078 --> 01:19:34.573
You know, Paige, you should
be really proud of yourself.

01:19:34.673 --> 01:19:36.489
All that hard work paid off.

01:19:36.589 --> 01:19:38.845
We beat the Titans.

01:19:38.945 --> 01:19:41.120
Yeah, I am. That's great.

01:19:41.220 --> 01:19:44.315
I guess I'm just kind of looking
forward to a change, you know?

01:19:44.415 --> 01:19:47.169
To help me take my mind off
what we're losing.

01:19:48.008 --> 01:19:50.742
Oh, sweetie,
you can't look at it that way.

01:19:50.842 --> 01:19:52.619
We didn't lose him.

01:19:52.719 --> 01:19:54.715
He'll be watching over us.

01:19:55.434 --> 01:19:57.430
It's different.

01:19:58.908 --> 01:20:00.904
Come in!

01:20:02.141 --> 01:20:03.279
- Hi.
- Hey.

01:20:03.379 --> 01:20:05.156
Hi.

01:20:05.256 --> 01:20:07.252
Are you sure
you want us over today?

01:20:07.652 --> 01:20:10.087
Yeah, I mean,
we don't wanna intrude.

01:20:10.526 --> 01:20:13.261
No, you're not intruding.
This was Piper's idea.

01:20:13.361 --> 01:20:16.914
I can only imagine what
she's going through. How's she doing?

01:20:18.072 --> 01:20:19.210
We're not really sure.

01:20:19.310 --> 01:20:22.085
She wanted to be alone
with the baby last night.

01:20:22.185 --> 01:20:25.858
Yeah, I wouldn't be surprised if she
didn't come out of her room for a year.

01:20:27.016 --> 01:20:28.233
Hi, guys.

01:20:28.333 --> 01:20:30.109
- I'm so glad you could come.
- Hi.

01:20:30.209 --> 01:20:31.906
Hi.

01:20:32.006 --> 01:20:33.743
We wanted to show our support.

01:20:33.843 --> 01:20:35.540
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

01:20:35.640 --> 01:20:37.057
Leo was...

01:20:37.157 --> 01:20:38.813
...is...

01:20:38.913 --> 01:20:40.910
...somebody who...

01:20:44.344 --> 01:20:46.719
Oh, come on, guys.
This is a celebration.

01:20:46.819 --> 01:20:48.635
Leo got promoted.

01:20:48.735 --> 01:20:50.152
We should all be happy for him.

01:20:50.252 --> 01:20:51.870
- I am.
- You are?

01:20:51.970 --> 01:20:53.546
Of course I am.

01:20:53.646 --> 01:20:57.059
Piper, you don't have to put on
a brave face. We're all here for you.

01:20:57.159 --> 01:21:00.494
Suppressing emotions
in this family can be dangerous.

01:21:00.594 --> 01:21:03.588
No, I'm not suppressing
anything, really. I'm okay.

01:21:04.107 --> 01:21:06.562
Now, let's eat before
the baby wakes up from his nap.

01:21:06.662 --> 01:21:10.056
Oh, I forgot the baby monitor.
Here. Be right back.

01:21:11.972 --> 01:21:14.667
Okay. Let's eat.

01:21:14.767 --> 01:21:16.804
- Go on.
- Yeah, come on, honey.

01:21:18.161 --> 01:21:20.057
Something's wrong with Piper.

01:21:20.157 --> 01:21:22.013
Maybe she's moved on.

01:21:22.113 --> 01:21:23.811
But Piper doesn't move on,
she fights.

01:21:23.911 --> 01:21:25.906
I'm telling you, that wasn't Piper.

01:21:40.359 --> 01:21:42.835
So did the Elders decide
what to do with me yet?

01:21:43.514 --> 01:21:46.648
Well, you've been the subject
of heated discussion.

01:21:46.748 --> 01:21:49.083
One thing we agreed upon is...

01:21:49.183 --> 01:21:51.080
...you can't return to the future.

01:21:51.180 --> 01:21:52.437
I figured as much.

01:21:52.537 --> 01:21:54.893
The time line's changed.
I don't even know what I'd go back to.

01:21:57.329 --> 01:21:59.065
So...

01:21:59.165 --> 01:22:01.161
...what did they decide?

01:22:01.640 --> 01:22:03.716
The Elders voted...

01:22:04.435 --> 01:22:06.431
...to make you the Charmed Ones'
new whitelighter.

01:22:07.509 --> 01:22:08.687
They did?

01:22:08.787 --> 01:22:11.702
As a reward for helping
defeat the Titans. But then...

01:22:12.380 --> 01:22:14.377
...somehow, I figured you knew that.

01:22:15.135 --> 01:22:18.788
You know, I can't stop thinking
about what Piper said,

01:22:18.888 --> 01:22:21.024
and wondering myself,

01:22:21.124 --> 01:22:23.121
if this wasn't part
of your plan all along.

01:22:26.634 --> 01:22:28.830
Take good care of them, Chris.

01:22:29.310 --> 01:22:30.846
Don't forget...

01:22:30.946 --> 01:22:32.943
...l'll be watching over you.
