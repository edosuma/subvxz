06:42.000 --> 06:43.800
Hey, kid.

06:44.800 --> 06:46.200
Want to spar?

06:47.900 --> 06:49.400
You a pro?

06:49.500 --> 06:52.900
I used to be.
I'm a little out of shape now.

06:53.000 --> 06:56.900
Come on. I won't hit you hard.
Maybe we can just fool around.

06:57.000 --> 06:58.900
I'll teach you a few things.

07:00.200 --> 07:02.400
You'd better put this on.

07:20.200 --> 07:21.400
You look good.

07:25.500 --> 07:27.400
Ready?

07:27.500 --> 07:28.900
Bong.

07:40.500 --> 07:42.500
You all right?
Good.

08:19.400 --> 08:20.900
Hold it.

08:22.900 --> 08:25.000
- You all right?
- Yeah, I pulled a muscle.

08:25.100 --> 08:27.900
You okay?

08:28.000 --> 08:30.600
I should have warmed up better.

08:32.100 --> 08:34.299
I haven't fought
in a year and a half.

08:42.200 --> 08:43.500
What's your name?

08:45.000 --> 08:48.100
- Ernie Munger.
- How many bouts you had?

08:48.200 --> 08:51.200
- None.
- You've never been in the ring?

08:51.300 --> 08:55.100
No. I just came to the Y
to fool around a little.

08:55.200 --> 08:57.200
- How old are you?
- Eighteen.

09:03.000 --> 09:05.400
- You've never been in the ring?
- No.

09:07.600 --> 09:09.765
Well...

09:09.800 --> 09:12.400
I think you've got it, kid.

09:12.500 --> 09:14.600
I ought to know
what I'm talking about.

09:14.700 --> 09:16.600
I fought Efram Soto.

09:18.700 --> 09:22.300
There was a time
when nobody could hit me.

09:22.400 --> 09:25.400
They'd try, but I wouldn't be there.

09:26.700 --> 09:30.300
- You ought to start fighting.
- No, I just come to fool around.

09:32.500 --> 09:34.365
Listen...

09:34.400 --> 09:36.400
don't waste your good years.

09:37.700 --> 09:40.000
You know, you ought to go over
to the Lido Gym...

09:40.035 --> 09:42.017
and see my manager, Ruben Luna.

09:42.052 --> 09:44.000
Tell him I sent you... Billy Tully.

09:44.100 --> 09:46.200
- I saw you fight once.
- Yeah?

09:46.300 --> 09:49.300
- Did I win?
- No.

10:38.200 --> 10:40.200
Don't you ever go home?

10:41.400 --> 10:43.300
I just got here.

10:48.600 --> 10:52.300
What's keeping him?
He can see we're sitting here.

10:52.400 --> 10:56.600
- Can't you get him to serve us?
- Just take it easy. He'll be here.

10:56.635 --> 11:00.700
You spineless son of a bitch.
You'd take anybody against me.

11:00.800 --> 11:02.800
I want a cream sherry.

11:05.400 --> 11:08.200
Earl and me got something
very wonderful together.

11:08.300 --> 11:11.900
I love that man more than
any man's got a right to be loved.

11:12.000 --> 11:15.650
If he left me, I couldn't make it.
I couldn't live without him.

11:15.685 --> 11:19.300
Do you think he'd even raise his voice
and get me a drink? No.

11:19.400 --> 11:22.100
He'll just sit there
and let them ignore us.

11:22.135 --> 11:24.800
- Here he comes.
- Yeah, no thanks to you.

11:27.000 --> 11:28.600
Two sherries.

11:30.500 --> 11:32.400
I pulled a muscle.

11:33.800 --> 11:36.300
I make up my mind
to go back into training...

11:36.400 --> 11:38.600
I hardly get the gloves on...

11:38.700 --> 11:40.800
I pull a muscle.

11:40.900 --> 11:44.200
Earl, this guy's a fighter.

11:44.300 --> 11:47.100
- Oh, yeah?
- Aw, Christ.

11:47.200 --> 11:49.900
Why did I even mention it?
What do you know about it anyway?

11:50.000 --> 11:51.900
- Not much.
- That's what I mean.

11:52.000 --> 11:54.300
Sorry to bother you.
Why'd I open my mouth?

11:54.400 --> 11:56.300
I apologize.

11:58.100 --> 12:01.150
What do you want? I said I was sorry.
What more can I say?

12:01.185 --> 12:04.200
- I hear you, baby.
- Jesus, you sure don't act like it.

12:05.300 --> 12:07.600
I was sparring...

12:07.700 --> 12:09.700
with this young kid.

12:09.800 --> 12:14.100
He's a good prospect. He'd make a lot of
money someday if he was handled right.

12:14.200 --> 12:17.100
A natural athlete.

12:17.200 --> 12:18.800
What's his name?

12:18.900 --> 12:21.300
You wouldn't know who he was
if he did tell you.

12:21.400 --> 12:24.500
- Just asking.
- He's got to know everything.

12:24.600 --> 12:26.900
Aw. Now he's mad.

12:27.000 --> 12:30.000
He's not gonna talk.
He buts in, then he shuts up.

12:30.100 --> 12:32.700
- I want to hear this. Go ahead.
- That's it.

12:32.735 --> 12:35.700
Nothing more to hear.
That is all.

12:35.800 --> 12:37.765
The kid is a natural...

12:37.800 --> 12:41.300
and they come along
about one in a million.

12:45.200 --> 12:48.000
He's so goddamned sour.

12:48.100 --> 12:51.400
I don't see why
I can't have a little fun.

12:51.500 --> 12:55.000
I believe that everybody has
a right to live his own life.

12:55.100 --> 12:57.300
So screw everybody.

13:00.300 --> 13:02.200
I want to say something.

13:02.300 --> 13:05.000
I want to make a toast here
to this gentleman.

13:05.100 --> 13:07.800
I'll make it short...
just a few words.

13:07.835 --> 13:09.965
Here's to your health.

13:10.000 --> 13:13.500
God bless you and keep you
in all your battles.

13:13.600 --> 13:15.900
What is it?

13:16.000 --> 13:18.600
Oh, for Christ sakes.
What do you want?

13:18.700 --> 13:21.400
- Can't I even talk to anybody?
- I'm not stopping you.

13:21.500 --> 13:24.000
No. No, you're not stopping me.

13:24.100 --> 13:28.600
You just sit with your face shut
until the minute I start having fun.

13:28.700 --> 13:32.000
I'm sick of your bellyaching.
Is it my fault you can't fit in?

13:32.035 --> 13:34.367
Why can't you mind
your own business?

13:34.402 --> 13:36.700
And that goes for the rest of you.

13:38.100 --> 13:40.000
Oh, to hell with you.

14:10.200 --> 14:13.100
Want to fight, kid?

14:13.200 --> 14:15.700
- What's your weight?
- 175.

14:15.800 --> 14:19.300
Yeah, you've got a very good reach.
Looking for a manager?

14:19.400 --> 14:21.600
Yeah, I'm looking for Ruben Luna.

14:25.900 --> 14:27.200
Thanks.

14:42.600 --> 14:44.500
I'm Luna.
You want to see me?

14:44.600 --> 14:46.900
I thought I'd work out a little bit.
See what you think.

14:47.000 --> 14:49.400
- Billy Tully told me to come by.
- You know Billy?

14:49.500 --> 14:52.500
You got your stuff in there?
Get into your trunks.

14:55.100 --> 14:58.100
- What's Billy doing these days?
- He didn't say.

14:58.200 --> 15:00.900
I only met him once, at the Y.
Just sparred a little.

15:01.000 --> 15:03.900
How did you do with him? All right?
You must have done all right.

15:05.300 --> 15:08.800
Is Tully getting in shape?
Why was he at the Y instead of the Lido?

15:08.900 --> 15:11.000
I think he's afraid to show
his face around here.

15:11.100 --> 15:14.000
He was in about a year ago.
Said he wanted to start fighting again.

15:14.100 --> 15:17.165
Trained for three days, borrowed $20,
I haven't seen him since.

15:17.200 --> 15:20.600
Look what Felix Castillo done to me.
You know how much money I gave that guy?

15:20.700 --> 15:23.700
I used to give him $2, $3
nearly every damn day.

15:23.800 --> 15:26.065
It was movies, movies,
every damn day.

15:26.100 --> 15:28.500
Tully didn't know how to punch
when he first came to me.

15:28.600 --> 15:32.400
I put him on his way to the top.
He was the best fighter I ever handled.

15:32.500 --> 15:34.100
He was tough and had heart.

15:34.200 --> 15:37.065
But you can't watch a guy
24 hours a day.

15:37.100 --> 15:40.565
He married some broad, and she undid
all the good I did for him.

15:40.600 --> 15:45.800
And she destroyed his peace of mind.
He started losing, so she ran off.

15:45.835 --> 15:48.700
- Come on, kid. You all set?
- Time!

15:54.700 --> 15:56.600
I'm not rushing you.
I don't want you to think that.

15:56.700 --> 15:59.000
I just want to get a good look at you.
Wes.

16:29.500 --> 16:31.100
Sorry.

16:36.100 --> 16:37.200
Time!

16:42.100 --> 16:44.300
You're okay.

16:47.100 --> 16:49.700
Easy. It's okay.

16:49.735 --> 16:52.300
All, right, now...

16:54.500 --> 16:57.000
You step in with that jab, right?

16:57.100 --> 16:59.600
His head goes back.
Hit him again.

16:59.700 --> 17:01.700
Okay, again.
Hit him with the right!

17:01.800 --> 17:03.400
Okay. All right.

17:03.435 --> 17:05.665
That's it.

17:05.700 --> 17:07.200
Feint him.
Make your openings.

17:07.300 --> 17:09.400
You make your openings,
then bing, bing, bing!

17:09.500 --> 17:11.599
- Understand what I mean?
- Yeah.

17:11.700 --> 17:13.599
Okay.
There you go.

17:16.900 --> 17:20.000
A white kid came in today
that might shape up into something.

17:20.099 --> 17:22.000
That's good.

17:22.099 --> 17:24.700
He's got a great reach
and a good pair of legs.

17:24.800 --> 17:26.700
And he's white, you know?

17:26.800 --> 17:29.100
Real clean, good-looking kid.

17:29.200 --> 17:33.000
I've got nothing against coloreds,
there's just too many in the game.

17:33.100 --> 17:35.700
Anglos don't want to pay
to see two colored guys fight.

17:35.735 --> 17:38.200
They want to see a white guy fight.

17:38.235 --> 17:40.700
This kid could develop.

17:40.800 --> 17:44.200
Oh, you ought to see the reach on him.
And he's tall, you know?

17:44.300 --> 17:48.200
If he put on some weight, he could turn
into a good-looking white heavyweight.

17:48.300 --> 17:51.000
Oh, he could draw crowds someday...

17:51.100 --> 17:53.200
if he ever learned how to fight.

17:53.300 --> 17:55.700
Well, maybe he can
if he just listened to me...

17:55.800 --> 17:58.600
and let me put
everything I know into him.

18:03.000 --> 18:04.900
Sweetheart, you awake?

18:18.500 --> 18:21.000
Who wants to go to work?
Onion toppers, 20 cents a box.

18:24.500 --> 18:27.100
Tomatoes, 60 cents a box.

18:27.135 --> 18:28.900
Tomatoes, over here.

18:37.800 --> 18:40.600
Let's pick those cucumbers!
Twenty cents a box!

18:47.700 --> 18:49.900
Who wants to go to work?

18:50.000 --> 18:52.200
Let's go pick those melons.

18:55.400 --> 18:59.600
Who wants to go to work?
Onion toppers, 20 cents a sack.

18:59.700 --> 19:02.100
Melons. Come on,
let's go pick those melons.

19:12.400 --> 19:14.900
Cucumbers, 20 cents a box!

19:20.900 --> 19:22.400
How much per sack?

19:22.500 --> 19:25.200
If a man wants to work,
he could make $15, $20 a day.

19:25.300 --> 19:27.200
- How much per sack?
- Twenty cents.

19:27.300 --> 19:29.400
Go on up.

19:29.500 --> 19:32.000
Onion toppers over here.

19:34.800 --> 19:38.500
Young feller like you
ought to have a proper job.

19:38.535 --> 19:41.017
I had a job.
I just got fired.

19:41.052 --> 19:43.500
What was it?
Maybe I can get it.

19:43.535 --> 19:45.765
Fry cook.

19:45.800 --> 19:47.800
Oh, I can't cook.

19:49.200 --> 19:50.800
I can't either.

19:51.600 --> 19:56.100
Worked my ass for eight bucks yesterday.
Good God. Here I am in this bus again.

19:56.135 --> 19:58.500
You made eight bucks?
Heck, you make more than I did.

19:58.600 --> 20:00.700
I worked like hell yesterday.

20:00.800 --> 20:04.100
After they made the deductions,
I only had five bucks left.

20:04.200 --> 20:06.600
It's sure tough to make
a buck these days.

22:06.200 --> 22:10.100
Now, keep that head moving.
All the time, move it, move it.

22:12.200 --> 22:15.900
- I bought Ernie an amateur license.
- Great. You'll be out five bucks.

22:16.000 --> 22:17.865
No, he won't quit.
Guess what happened.

22:17.900 --> 22:21.200
The doctor wanted to test his blood,
could hardly get the needle in.

22:21.300 --> 22:23.800
- Dull needle, huh?
- No, he tried two needles.

22:23.835 --> 22:25.300
- Who, Ernie?
- Yeah.

22:25.400 --> 22:28.400
- Doctor could hardly get the needle in.
- Dull needle?

22:28.435 --> 22:30.000
The kid's got leather skin.

22:30.100 --> 22:32.065
That's very odd, Ruben.

22:32.100 --> 22:34.000
Never would have thought that,
looking at him.

22:34.100 --> 22:36.500
Rudy Chavez had thick skin,
but he was tough.

22:36.600 --> 22:38.900
You guys know that.
They don't make 'em like him anymore.

22:39.000 --> 22:42.700
You haven't heard the half of it.
He gets the needle in and blood out...

22:42.800 --> 22:44.300
and it's almost black.

22:44.400 --> 22:46.865
I had Chavez in
against Chu Chu Montoya.

22:46.900 --> 22:50.200
In the first round, my boy gets butted
over the eye. Blood starts coming down.

22:50.300 --> 22:53.000
So I said, "Well, there goes the fight. "

22:53.100 --> 22:55.600
It wasn't his blood at all.
It was Montoya's blood.

22:55.700 --> 22:59.300
Remember Estrada? I saw him open
a Coke bottle with his teeth.

22:59.400 --> 23:01.265
- What are you saying...
- Will you listen, please?

23:01.300 --> 23:04.300
You haven't heard the half of it.
He finally gets the blood out...

23:04.400 --> 23:05.700
and it's black.

23:05.800 --> 23:09.400
So he stares at it for a minute
and turns the tube upside-down...

23:09.500 --> 23:11.900
and the blood don't run down,
it hangs up there.

23:12.000 --> 23:14.100
It turned to gelatin.

23:14.200 --> 23:17.000
Chavez had the clearest piss
of any fighter I ever saw.

23:17.100 --> 23:19.400
He would take a specimen,
and the piss in that bottle...

23:19.500 --> 23:21.400
would be just as clean and as pure...

23:21.500 --> 23:24.100
as fresh drinking water.

23:38.900 --> 23:40.800
Take the wheel.

23:47.200 --> 23:50.400
No, easy! Slow and easy.
That's it.

23:51.700 --> 23:54.200
Go easy! Go easy!

24:02.000 --> 24:03.800
Don't spin the wheels!

24:03.900 --> 24:06.965
- Hold it.
- What are you saying?

24:07.000 --> 24:10.600
- I can't hear you. What?
- Will you hold it, Faye?

24:10.700 --> 24:13.600
I'm gonna look for some boards
to put under the wheels.

24:24.600 --> 24:26.000
Hold it!

24:37.500 --> 24:39.400
Move over.

24:58.200 --> 25:00.000
Don't touch me.
I'm all muddy.

25:00.100 --> 25:04.000
I don't care if you're muddy or not.
Put your arm around me.

25:04.100 --> 25:06.200
Not while I'm driving in the rain.

25:10.800 --> 25:13.000
I'm glad.

25:13.100 --> 25:14.400
About what?

25:14.500 --> 25:17.300
You know.
Not being a virgin anymore.

25:21.400 --> 25:23.200
What?

25:23.300 --> 25:26.100
Not that I'd feel any different.

25:26.200 --> 25:30.000
It's just that I thought
I'd see the world through new eyes.

25:30.100 --> 25:32.300
But I don't.

25:33.900 --> 25:37.300
- You've never done it before?
- Certainly not.

25:42.000 --> 25:44.600
You've done it lots of times,
I suppose.

25:45.500 --> 25:48.200
Well, I'm going on 19, after all.

25:48.300 --> 25:51.300
How was I compared to the other girls?

25:51.400 --> 25:53.000
All right.

25:54.800 --> 25:56.700
I mean, wonderful.
You were wonderful.

25:56.735 --> 25:59.700
- Really?
- Yeah, wonderful.

26:00.700 --> 26:02.700
I'll get better with practice.

26:02.800 --> 26:05.300
Anybody would have thought you had
all the practice in the world.

26:09.100 --> 26:13.300
- Hope you're not implying anything.
- No, I meant you were wonderful.

26:16.500 --> 26:18.100
Will you call me tomorrow?

26:18.200 --> 26:20.450
What for?

26:20.485 --> 26:22.700
No reason.

26:22.800 --> 26:25.200
Just want to hear
the sound of your voice.

26:34.500 --> 26:36.600
Let's go, guys.

26:48.400 --> 26:50.300
Let's go, Babe!

26:57.200 --> 26:59.365
Monterey, here we come!

26:59.400 --> 27:01.600
We got the winners tonight, Babe.
What do you think?

27:01.700 --> 27:04.700
- Yeah, I think we got the winners.
- For sure winners.

27:04.735 --> 27:06.900
- You know what I'd like to do someday?
- What?

27:07.000 --> 27:11.300
Take these guys to England.
They really appreciate class over there.

27:11.400 --> 27:14.900
When we turn these boys pro,
I'd really like to make that trip.

27:20.700 --> 27:22.400
Nice house today.

27:23.400 --> 27:25.100
Ernie, listen.

27:25.200 --> 27:27.900
This guy can't fight.
You'll knock him out. How do you feel?

27:28.000 --> 27:29.900
- Hardly wait to get in?
- I'll give it all I've got.

27:30.000 --> 27:32.600
You may have to go the full three,
so don't punch yourself out.

27:32.700 --> 27:34.400
- Don't lose your head.
- Pace myself.

27:34.500 --> 27:37.100
Look, don't hang back.
It goes fast.

27:37.200 --> 27:39.965
- Give it everything I got.
- Still you want to pace yourself.

27:40.000 --> 27:43.600
Buford, your guy's been around.
Don't let him get a good shot at you.

27:43.700 --> 27:46.600
He's a boozer. You know how these
soldiers are. He won't go the limit.

27:46.700 --> 27:49.700
I don't care who he is,
'cause ain't nobody getting past me.

27:49.800 --> 27:52.300
I'm gonna be the world's champ
by the time I'm 18.

27:52.335 --> 27:54.865
- Ain't he 18 now?
- Shit, he's only 15.

27:54.900 --> 27:57.100
- Can you fight if you're 15?
- Would you be quiet about that?

27:57.200 --> 28:00.100
Buford's Golden Gloves champion.
He don't fit the rules.

28:05.300 --> 28:07.965
Hope I didn't leave
my fight in the bedroom.

28:08.000 --> 28:10.500
Don't tell Ruben, but I was
getting a little last night.

28:10.600 --> 28:12.300
- Hope I'm in shape.
- I was too.

28:12.400 --> 28:14.600
But that don't make no difference.
It don't matter if you're dead drunk.

28:14.700 --> 28:17.500
You got two hands. You can beat
this dude. I don't care who he is.

28:17.600 --> 28:19.700
It's all in your mind.

28:19.800 --> 28:20.900
I hope so.

28:21.000 --> 28:23.300
Hoping never done nothing.
It's wanting to do it.

28:23.400 --> 28:25.665
You got to want to win
so bad you can taste it.

28:25.700 --> 28:29.500
If you want to win bad enough, you win.
No way in hell this dude will beat me.

28:29.600 --> 28:32.700
He's too old. I'm too fast.
I'm gonna be all over him.

28:32.800 --> 28:35.500
I'm gonna kick his ass so bad,
every time he eats food tomorrow...

28:35.600 --> 28:36.900
he'll think of me.

28:37.000 --> 28:40.000
He's gonna know he's been in a fight,
'cause I'll hit him with everything.

28:40.100 --> 28:42.600
I'm not just gonna beat that mother,
I'm gonna kill him.

28:42.635 --> 28:44.565
- You know what makes a good fighter?
- What?

28:44.600 --> 28:48.500
Believing in yourself, the will to win.
You want to kick ass, you kick ass.

28:48.600 --> 28:50.600
- You're right.
- You don't want to kick ass.

28:50.635 --> 28:52.200
You want to get
your own ass whupped.

28:52.300 --> 28:54.100
I want to kick ass.
Don't worry.

28:54.200 --> 28:58.300
You gotta want to kick ass so bad there
ain't no manager or pill that can do it.

28:58.400 --> 29:01.600
- I want to kick ass as bad as you do.
- Then go out there and kick ass!

29:01.635 --> 29:03.600
- All right!
- First bout, Ernie Munger.

29:05.100 --> 29:07.900
We got to go now.
Hey, did you get the towels?

29:08.000 --> 29:10.050
- I didn't get to warm up.
- You're okay. You're ready.

29:10.085 --> 29:12.100
- Just stay loose. Where's the bucket?
- In my hand.

29:12.200 --> 29:13.765
- Where's the bottle.
- In the bucket.

29:13.800 --> 29:15.800
- Is there water in it?
- I wouldn't bring an empty bottle.

29:15.900 --> 29:18.300
I just don't want my kid out there
without any water.

29:18.335 --> 29:20.500
I told you I got the water.
Take it easy.

29:20.535 --> 29:22.500
Let's go.

29:29.700 --> 29:31.900
<i>Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.</i>

29:32.000 --> 29:35.600
<i>Welcome to tonight's star-studded
program of amateur boxing.</i>

29:35.635 --> 29:39.400
Each bout will consist of
three two-minute rounds...

29:39.500 --> 29:42.400
in accordance with the California
State Athletic Commission.

29:42.500 --> 29:45.400
Your referee, from San Francisco,
Ron Dixon.

29:45.500 --> 29:48.900
This is the first bout of the night.
Introducing first, in the blue corner...

29:49.000 --> 29:52.000
weighing 170 pounds,
from Stockton...

29:52.100 --> 29:53.900
Irish Ernie Munger.

29:54.000 --> 29:55.800
I'm not Irish.

29:55.900 --> 29:58.100
I just said it that way
so they'd know you're white.

29:58.200 --> 30:00.700
It'll look great in the paper.
Wave to the crowd.

30:00.800 --> 30:05.100
<i>In the red corner,
weighing 172 pounds, from Salinas...</i>

30:05.135 --> 30:07.965
<i>Manuel Rosales.</i>

30:08.000 --> 30:10.800
I want both you boys to be sure
to protect yourselves at all times.

30:30.600 --> 30:32.500
Jab, baby! Jab!

30:36.500 --> 30:38.900
Right jab! Yeah!
That's it, baby!

30:46.300 --> 30:48.200
Move, move, move!

30:53.000 --> 30:56.200
Jab, jab! Jab!

31:04.100 --> 31:06.000
That's the stuff!

31:06.100 --> 31:07.900
Terrific!

31:11.000 --> 31:12.800
Right in there!

31:54.200 --> 31:57.900
This guy's finished. Unload on him.
Move in there, Ernie. Use the hook.

31:57.935 --> 32:00.900
- Work him in. Two punches...
- Keep your punches up.

32:01.000 --> 32:03.000
- You can take him.
- Tear his head off.

32:03.035 --> 32:05.200
- Jab, jab, hook.
- Seconds out.

32:26.000 --> 32:28.000
Break.

32:53.000 --> 32:56.900
<i>The winner by technical knockout,
in the red corner, from Salinas...</i>

32:57.000 --> 32:59.300
<i>Manuel Rosales.</i>

33:04.500 --> 33:05.965
Good fight.

33:06.000 --> 33:07.700
Tilt your head back.
Breathe through your mouth.

33:07.800 --> 33:10.700
- He was butting you.
- Sure we was butting. He can't punch.

33:14.400 --> 33:16.400
I'm all right.

33:18.600 --> 33:20.800
Next bout, Henry Reed.
Come on.

33:27.600 --> 33:31.300
- You lose, huh?
- They shouldn't have stopped it.

33:31.400 --> 33:33.600
You ought to get a note
from the doctor before you leave.

33:33.700 --> 33:36.300
You can get that nose set
and it won't cost you nothing.

33:36.335 --> 33:38.900
Get him out of those trunks.
He was butted, Al.

33:39.000 --> 33:40.900
They should throw that kid
out of the ring.

33:41.000 --> 33:43.050
- Get into your trunks.
- He's all bloody.

33:43.085 --> 33:45.100
Don't worry about it.
It's not your blood.

33:45.200 --> 33:47.800
Let me look at that.
Easy. Don't touch it.

33:47.835 --> 33:50.300
Don't touch it!

33:58.400 --> 34:01.600
Buford, you doing all right?
How do you feel?

34:01.700 --> 34:04.100
Just pissed off, Ruben.

34:04.200 --> 34:06.765
You dropped your left.
Don't sweat over it.

34:06.800 --> 34:09.600
You get him again,
you'll knock him out next time.

34:09.699 --> 34:12.900
Ernie, you'll get that nose fixed
good as new. Don't worry.

34:13.000 --> 34:15.699
Look at mine. Would you believe
mine was ever busted?

34:15.800 --> 34:17.300
Yes.

34:19.400 --> 34:22.900
I don't know what deal we're getting
tonight, but I've never seen its like.

34:23.000 --> 34:25.100
Stopping that fight
when Ernie had that guy beat...

34:25.199 --> 34:27.000
That kid should have been
disqualified.

34:27.100 --> 34:31.000
And Wes wasn't hurt either. Anyone
can get tagged in the first round.

34:31.100 --> 34:33.100
And Bobby won every round.

34:33.199 --> 34:36.500
He did. That's a fact.
That was robbery if I've ever seen it.

34:36.600 --> 34:39.400
You were hurting that boy.

34:39.435 --> 34:42.199
Hey, sweetheart.
Sweetheart.

34:44.199 --> 34:47.600
Can we have more beer
and pop for the boys?

35:12.600 --> 35:13.900
Glass of beer, please.

35:29.700 --> 35:31.100
Hi!

35:34.000 --> 35:37.300
- How've you been keeping?
- Terrible.

35:54.600 --> 35:56.500
Are you alone?

35:58.300 --> 36:01.065
Mind if I sit down?

36:01.100 --> 36:03.700
It's a free country.
Help yourself.

36:06.200 --> 36:08.700
Where's your old man?

36:10.300 --> 36:12.200
In jail.

36:13.700 --> 36:14.700
What for?

36:16.900 --> 36:20.200
Because they won't leave you alone
in this world, that's why.

36:22.500 --> 36:25.700
You don't know what you have
to take when you're interracial.

36:25.800 --> 36:29.800
Every bum on the street
has to get a look at you.

36:29.835 --> 36:31.800
Earl...

36:31.900 --> 36:33.900
he's a peaceable man.

36:34.000 --> 36:35.800
Even-tempered.

36:35.900 --> 36:39.500
He did not hurt that guy.
It was a nick on the back of the neck.

36:39.600 --> 36:42.000
He'd wouldn't any more try
to assault somebody...

36:42.035 --> 36:45.500
than you'd get on that stool
and try to fly.

36:47.300 --> 36:50.200
He's not made that way.

36:50.300 --> 36:53.600
He's the sweetest-natured man
in the world.

36:53.700 --> 36:56.400
He'll get out.

36:57.200 --> 36:59.465
He's so jealous.

36:59.500 --> 37:02.100
I wouldn't put it past him
to be out already...

37:02.200 --> 37:04.300
spying on every move I make.

37:06.600 --> 37:09.800
He's so possessive.
He won't let me talk to people.

37:09.900 --> 37:12.000
He gets mad at me.

37:12.100 --> 37:16.300
You remember the last time we talked?
Way back then, remember?

37:16.400 --> 37:18.600
Do you know what he did
to me afterwards?

37:18.700 --> 37:20.100
He raped me.

37:20.200 --> 37:23.200
- No shit?
- Yes.

37:23.300 --> 37:26.300
He picked me up
and he threw me on that bed.

37:29.100 --> 37:31.000
Don't look at me like that.

37:31.100 --> 37:33.100
I'm not ashamed to say it.

37:33.200 --> 37:35.700
I've never been ashamed
of the act of love.

37:35.800 --> 37:37.700
I believe it's a part of life.

37:37.800 --> 37:40.400
Sure. Why not?
You should.

37:40.500 --> 37:43.600
Of course,
if people like each other...

37:43.700 --> 37:47.800
I'm not talking about free love.
I have no use for that.

37:49.400 --> 37:51.800
You know, free
depends what you mean "free. "

37:53.100 --> 37:55.000
I mean...

37:55.100 --> 37:57.000
if it's not...

37:58.800 --> 38:02.400
free, can you call it love?

38:02.500 --> 38:05.050
I'm talking about love.

38:05.085 --> 38:07.600
Real love, not just sex.

38:09.400 --> 38:12.000
When you're really in love,
you marry for life...

38:12.035 --> 38:15.400
and that is the only way it can be.

38:15.500 --> 38:19.400
I don't consider
my second marriage sanctified.

38:19.500 --> 38:21.600
I should've stayed true to Frank.

38:21.700 --> 38:23.865
Frank?
Who's Frank?

38:23.900 --> 38:27.800
Frank.
That was my first husband.

38:27.900 --> 38:30.700
He's full-blooded Cherokee.

38:30.800 --> 38:32.800
You married an Indian?

38:32.900 --> 38:35.450
What's wrong with that?
You think you're any better?

38:35.485 --> 38:38.000
- I'm not bagging on it.
- You just watch what you say.

38:38.100 --> 38:41.000
I won't stand for any insults
against Frank.

38:44.500 --> 38:46.400
I still wear his wedding ring.

38:50.400 --> 38:52.400
Where is he?

38:53.900 --> 38:55.600
I'm a widow.

38:57.900 --> 38:59.600
That's too bad.

38:59.700 --> 39:02.500
I'm sorry to hear that.
What happened to him?

39:03.600 --> 39:05.800
He was shot.

39:07.600 --> 39:09.500
No kidding?

39:15.100 --> 39:18.000
- Who did it?
- He was a police officer.

39:19.400 --> 39:21.800
He was killed in the line of duty.

39:23.700 --> 39:25.500
That's terrible.

39:28.200 --> 39:30.600
I was married too.

39:30.635 --> 39:33.000
She ran out on me.

39:33.100 --> 39:36.100
We didn't even have time
to have children.

39:37.500 --> 39:39.800
I married white the next time.
All he was good for...

39:39.900 --> 39:42.200
was running us off an embankment.

39:42.300 --> 39:45.465
That and spending the insurance.

39:45.500 --> 39:49.500
Marrying him was the biggest
mistake of my life.

39:49.600 --> 39:52.500
He had unnatural desires.

39:54.300 --> 39:55.600
He did?

39:55.700 --> 39:57.700
The white race is in its decline.

39:57.800 --> 40:01.800
It started downhill in 1492
when Columbus discovered syphilis.

40:03.500 --> 40:06.465
- What did he want to do?
- White men are animals.

40:06.500 --> 40:09.500
- We're not so bad.
- White man is the vermin of the earth.

40:09.535 --> 40:11.800
- Not so loud.
- Don't tell me what to do.

40:11.900 --> 40:14.700
I don't care who hears me. I know
I'm making a nuisance of myself...

40:14.735 --> 40:17.000
to all these goddamn Mexicans
sitting here.

40:17.100 --> 40:19.465
They don't know who
their real friends are.

40:19.500 --> 40:23.000
- What are you going on about?
- Take your hands off me!

40:23.100 --> 40:26.300
You are liable to get backhanded
right off that stool.

40:26.400 --> 40:28.600
You see if I care one bit!
That's all I need!

40:28.700 --> 40:30.650
You go ahead,
if it'll make you feel so good!

40:30.685 --> 40:32.600
- I'm sorry.
- Get it out of your system!

40:32.700 --> 40:35.500
Go on, if it'll make you feel good!
Punch me in the face!

40:35.600 --> 40:38.165
- God Almighty.
- Take some teeth out while you're at it!

40:38.200 --> 40:41.050
I still got a few left. The others
were nice enough to leave me.

40:41.085 --> 40:43.900
- I wouldn't hit you. I'm sorry.
- It'll be a big lift for you.

40:43.935 --> 40:46.100
What are you waiting for?
It's just the thing you need!

40:46.200 --> 40:48.500
Far be it from me
to spoil anybody's fun!

40:48.600 --> 40:51.900
I'm sorry! Will you listen to me,
goddamn it? I am sorry!

40:52.000 --> 40:54.700
So what?
So you're sorry.

40:56.100 --> 40:58.850
Well, I feel like banging my head.

40:58.885 --> 41:01.742
Go ahead!
I'm not gonna stop you.

41:01.777 --> 41:04.600
Feel like I could just bust my head...

41:06.300 --> 41:07.500
on that jukebox.

41:07.600 --> 41:09.100
Go ahead!

41:18.000 --> 41:19.800
What did you do that for?

41:21.700 --> 41:23.900
You told me to go ahead and do it,
so I did it.

41:25.500 --> 41:28.600
You can count on me
right down the line.

41:28.700 --> 41:30.600
You want to knock your brains out?

41:31.600 --> 41:34.800
You can count on me.

41:37.000 --> 41:39.200
Just don't bump your head anymore.

41:39.300 --> 41:40.900
Listen.

41:42.300 --> 41:44.300
Let me tell you something.

41:45.900 --> 41:49.100
You can count on me...

41:49.200 --> 41:51.900
right down the line.

41:54.200 --> 41:56.300
I thought you wanted to hit me.

41:56.400 --> 41:59.000
Oh, God.
Will you forget that?

41:59.100 --> 42:01.200
I never hit a woman in my life.

42:05.700 --> 42:07.400
Let me buy you a drink.

42:09.200 --> 42:11.500
Could we have two
cream sherries, please?

42:14.500 --> 42:17.465
Won't you believe me?

42:17.500 --> 42:20.800
Don't you think
that you can count on me?

42:28.900 --> 42:31.200
Just don't bump your head anymore.

42:31.300 --> 42:34.400
Oh, come on.
Will you forget that?

42:36.100 --> 42:38.500
Hey, listen.
I just asked you a question.

42:40.700 --> 42:43.800
Do you think I'd let you down?

42:43.900 --> 42:45.600
I don't know.
Would you?

42:45.700 --> 42:48.900
Hey, I wouldn't.
I wouldn't.

42:49.000 --> 42:52.800
Maybe you wouldn't.
How would I know?

42:55.600 --> 42:57.400
You...

42:57.435 --> 42:59.067
can...

42:59.102 --> 43:00.700
count...

43:03.300 --> 43:05.700
on me.

43:05.800 --> 43:08.400
You can count on me.

43:08.500 --> 43:10.565
No, I'm the reliable type.

43:10.600 --> 43:13.600
Do you know who your friends are?

43:13.635 --> 43:17.000
Listen. Anytime...

43:17.100 --> 43:19.200
you need anything...

43:19.300 --> 43:21.300
you just come and see me.

43:23.000 --> 43:27.100
These others,
I wouldn't ask the time of day.

43:27.200 --> 43:30.100
They wouldn't give it to you.

43:30.200 --> 43:32.665
Do you know something?

43:32.700 --> 43:35.900
You're the only son of a bitch
worth a shit in this place.

43:37.800 --> 43:40.100
I appreciate that.

43:40.200 --> 43:42.300
Because...

43:42.400 --> 43:45.400
there is something
I really like about you.

43:47.200 --> 43:49.400
I like you too.

43:58.000 --> 43:59.200
To us.

44:06.200 --> 44:09.400
Let's get out of this joint.

44:09.500 --> 44:11.800
Let's go somewhere else.

44:18.600 --> 44:20.500
Keep the change.

44:34.400 --> 44:36.700
Hey, you all right?

44:36.800 --> 44:40.300
- I don't know.
- You gonna make it?

44:40.400 --> 44:42.300
I guess I'm drunk.

44:44.100 --> 44:46.500
Don't worry about anything.
I'll get you home.

44:46.600 --> 44:48.700
You can count on me.

44:50.000 --> 44:52.000
- Going the right way?
- Yep.

44:55.800 --> 44:57.800
What's the matter?

45:02.200 --> 45:04.200
I love you so much.

45:08.800 --> 45:11.100
Hey, come on.

45:11.200 --> 45:14.400
Everything's gonna be okay now.

45:14.500 --> 45:16.200
I feel it is.

45:16.300 --> 45:18.065
It is.

45:18.100 --> 45:20.200
- You can count on me.
- Right.

45:20.300 --> 45:22.700
- And I can count on you.
- Yep.

45:22.800 --> 45:24.865
<i>I can count on you</i>

45:24.900 --> 45:27.965
<i>And you can count on me</i>

45:28.000 --> 45:30.300
<i>And we can count on each other</i>

45:33.300 --> 45:35.200
- White look all right on me?
- Perfect.

45:35.235 --> 45:37.200
- You professional?
- Amateur.

45:37.300 --> 45:40.200
Won his last three fights.
They couldn't touch him. Kid's fast.

45:40.300 --> 45:43.200
- What do you think?
- It's just the right image for you.

45:43.300 --> 45:46.000
When you come out in that,
you're gonna look like a champ.

45:47.500 --> 45:49.300
Champion of the world.

46:06.100 --> 46:09.500
One, two, three.

46:15.500 --> 46:17.700
<i>The winner by KO...</i>

46:17.800 --> 46:21.165
<i>in 23 seconds of round one...</i>

46:21.200 --> 46:24.200
- Let's get him to his corner.
- Come on, baby. Come on.

46:26.200 --> 46:28.900
Easy.
Take it easy.

46:31.900 --> 46:35.600
What's your name? What's your name?
Where are you?

46:35.700 --> 46:38.700
- Did I get knocked out?
- Tell me your name. Can you do that?

46:38.800 --> 46:41.200
Ernie Munger.
What round is it?

46:41.300 --> 46:43.400
How many fingers do you see?

46:44.600 --> 46:47.800
Can you see my hand?
How many fingers?

46:47.900 --> 46:50.700
- Five.
- He's okay.

46:50.800 --> 46:52.600
You're okay, Ernie.

47:08.300 --> 47:10.400
- What's the matter?
- Nothing.

47:11.800 --> 47:14.600
Don't you feel good?

47:14.700 --> 47:17.600
- I'm all right.
- Is anything wrong?

47:17.700 --> 47:20.600
- I said "nothing. "
- What are you mad about then?

47:20.700 --> 47:24.800
Can't I be quiet if I feel like it
without everybody getting all worked up?

47:24.835 --> 47:27.800
- You're the only one getting worked up.
- Leave me alone then.

47:27.900 --> 47:30.565
I have a right to my moods.

47:30.600 --> 47:34.100
All right. I can take a hint.
Don't think I don't know what's wrong.

47:36.300 --> 47:38.665
You're unfulfilled.
I know.

47:38.700 --> 47:42.300
I'm fulfilled.
I'm perfectly fulfilled.

47:42.400 --> 47:44.300
That's not what's bothering me.

47:44.400 --> 47:46.600
You didn't get real fulfillment.

47:46.700 --> 47:50.700
Don't worry about that.
I'm fulfilled.

47:50.800 --> 47:53.200
That's not it at all.

47:53.300 --> 47:55.200
You're mad about something.

47:55.300 --> 47:57.400
I'm not mad.

48:00.200 --> 48:03.800
Just a little worried, that's all.

48:03.835 --> 48:05.800
About what?

48:07.900 --> 48:09.900
You know what.

48:19.600 --> 48:22.700
God, we've been pretty careful.

48:22.800 --> 48:26.300
If I was careful, I never would have
come out here in the first place.

48:27.800 --> 48:31.500
You wouldn't marry me now.
I just know you wouldn't.

48:31.600 --> 48:34.300
Men just don't
after the mystery's gone.

48:35.500 --> 48:38.900
They do too. They do it all the time.
What are you talking about?

48:39.000 --> 48:40.900
You wouldn't.

48:41.000 --> 48:43.100
- I would too.
- When?

48:44.400 --> 48:46.800
When it'd be right
for both of us.

48:46.900 --> 48:49.800
We don't want to rush into a mess
when we've got each other anyway.

48:49.900 --> 48:52.800
But don't you want to be with me
every night?

48:54.200 --> 48:57.900
Sure.
Maybe I can get a day job.

48:58.000 --> 49:00.500
Not what I meant.

49:02.500 --> 49:04.600
We don't want to rush into something.

49:04.700 --> 49:08.050
Look, don't think I'm proposing to you.

49:08.085 --> 49:10.842
That's a thing I certainly
would never do.

49:10.877 --> 49:13.600
I wouldn't want anybody
who didn't want me.

49:13.635 --> 49:15.000
I want you.

49:15.100 --> 49:17.965
Certainly wouldn't force myself
on anyone.

49:18.000 --> 49:21.765
It's just, I like to know
where I stand, that's all.

49:21.800 --> 49:25.800
Supposing you got drafted. Would you
expect me to be here when you came back?

49:25.900 --> 49:27.700
Yeah.

49:27.800 --> 49:30.465
Then why should we wait?

49:30.500 --> 49:33.200
I could quit school
and get a job.

49:33.300 --> 49:35.600
I want to be with you all the time.

49:35.700 --> 49:38.350
I want to cook for you.

49:38.385 --> 49:41.000
I don't know how you feel.

49:43.100 --> 49:46.400
I wouldn't want you to marry me
just because you thought you had to.

49:46.500 --> 49:50.265
Huh? Oh, sure.
No one has to, I guess.

49:50.300 --> 49:53.500
I mean, we could do something
about it easy enough.

49:53.535 --> 49:56.200
Yeah.
Sure we could.

49:56.300 --> 49:58.600
But I wouldn't want to.

50:01.000 --> 50:04.400
If I was, I'd want to have it.
Wouldn't you?

50:04.435 --> 50:07.200
Wouldn't you feel anything?

50:07.300 --> 50:08.700
Sure.

50:10.700 --> 50:13.300
Maybe you'd better see a doctor.

50:26.500 --> 50:28.400
Give me a cup of coffee.

50:31.900 --> 50:34.400
- How's it going, Ruben?
- Well, lost another one.

50:34.500 --> 50:37.700
- Ernie snuck off and got married.
- I might have known it.

50:37.735 --> 50:40.900
What kind of pie you want?
Never mind. Give me what he's got.

50:40.935 --> 50:43.465
Boy, she sure knows how
to fill a skirt.

50:43.500 --> 50:46.300
Yeah, I talked to his mother
on the phone. He got married.

50:46.400 --> 50:49.500
- What can you expect?
- All that energy they waste.

50:49.600 --> 50:52.500
If they're not getting married, they're
getting arrested or joining the navy...

50:52.535 --> 50:55.500
or killing themselves on motorcycles.

50:55.600 --> 50:58.600
You know why I think he did it?
I think that beating discouraged him.

50:58.700 --> 51:02.600
If you don't have confidence in yourself
you're never gonna get anywhere.

51:02.700 --> 51:05.200
I remember the first time
I passed blood.

51:05.300 --> 51:07.400
That was one scared kid.

51:07.500 --> 51:10.500
Sure, when I got my jaw broken and had
to suck liquids through a straw...

51:10.600 --> 51:13.900
I started wondering
if it was all worthwhile.

51:14.000 --> 51:16.000
Tell you what bothered me.

51:16.100 --> 51:18.300
Getting my throat ruined.

51:18.400 --> 51:20.700
You didn't keep your chin down.

51:20.800 --> 51:22.900
How's your nose.
Can you breathe?

51:23.000 --> 51:25.000
Yeah, can't you?

51:25.100 --> 51:27.500
Not on a wet day.

51:38.400 --> 51:40.300
- Hi, honey.
- Hi.

51:42.000 --> 51:44.000
How'd it go?

51:44.035 --> 51:46.800
Well...

51:46.900 --> 51:49.800
canneries weren't hiring today.

51:49.835 --> 51:52.700
Did you try the box factory?

51:54.400 --> 51:56.800
I've already been fired
from the box factory.

52:18.700 --> 52:20.265
You know...

52:20.300 --> 52:23.300
I guess I'm just gonna have to
start fighting again.

52:42.800 --> 52:44.600
- Honey!
- Yeah?

52:44.700 --> 52:47.900
- I wish you wouldn't do that.
- Do what?

52:48.000 --> 52:50.000
Kick Earl's box.

52:50.100 --> 52:53.300
I didn't kick it.
I fell over it.

52:53.400 --> 52:55.800
I don't believe in
kicking a man when he's down.

52:56.500 --> 53:00.500
Honey, it is not Earl in the box.
It's just his clothes.

53:00.535 --> 53:02.700
Clothes make the man.

53:04.200 --> 53:07.350
You know something, honey? You ought to
spruce yourself up a little.

53:07.385 --> 53:10.500
You are a good-looking man.
You should put your best foot forward.

53:10.535 --> 53:12.500
I know how I look.

53:12.600 --> 53:14.700
I look like a bum.

53:14.800 --> 53:17.000
- A am a bum.
- You're not a bum.

53:17.100 --> 53:21.100
If you took more pains in appearance,
you could get a job you really liked.

53:21.200 --> 53:24.300
The job I really like
hasn't been invented.

53:24.400 --> 53:26.600
You're handsome.
You are.

53:26.700 --> 53:28.500
All you need
is a little more flair.

53:28.600 --> 53:30.400
Flair?

53:34.200 --> 53:35.800
Come here.

53:38.000 --> 53:39.800
Try this on.

53:39.900 --> 53:41.665
- Oh, no.
- Go on. Try this on.

53:41.700 --> 53:42.900
- I don't want to try that on.
- Why not?

53:43.000 --> 53:45.100
I don't want to try it on.
It belongs to Earl.

53:45.200 --> 53:47.100
Earl would understand.

53:47.200 --> 53:50.400
Come on, now. He's
the kindest-hearted man in the world.

53:50.500 --> 53:52.350
For me?

53:52.385 --> 53:54.200
Honey?

54:04.700 --> 54:06.800
Get over there.

54:46.600 --> 54:50.000
What do you think?
Have I got flair now?

54:53.200 --> 54:56.300
- What's the matter?
- Poor bastard.

54:56.400 --> 54:59.700
- Who?
- Earl.

54:59.800 --> 55:02.100
Eating his heart out
in the pokey.

55:50.600 --> 55:52.000
Oh, boy.

55:53.900 --> 55:57.100
I'm in worse shape
than I thought I was.

55:57.200 --> 55:59.300
How long before a man
gets used to this?

55:59.400 --> 56:03.500
I've been doing it for 25 years
and ain't got used to it yet.

56:06.600 --> 56:10.300
All a man needs is a woman
with a good job.

56:10.400 --> 56:13.065
I had that. She left.

56:13.100 --> 56:15.400
I got one now
that won't work at all.

56:15.500 --> 56:17.800
That's the easiest kind to get.

56:17.900 --> 56:20.900
I had a good woman once,
but she divorced me.

56:20.935 --> 56:23.400
- How come?
- Because of wine.

56:23.500 --> 56:25.800
- Wine?
- Uh-huh.

56:25.900 --> 56:29.600
My wife would go to work
and I'd sit home and drink wine.

56:29.700 --> 56:31.800
There was this girl that lived
across the hall.

56:31.900 --> 56:35.200
She was a friend of my wife.

56:35.300 --> 56:38.300
My door would be open,
and I'd see her walk by.

56:38.400 --> 56:40.600
I asked if she wanted a drink.

56:40.700 --> 56:42.900
So we started drinking together...

56:43.000 --> 56:45.765
and she looking better and better...

56:45.800 --> 56:48.400
until I'm over there
as soon as my wife leaves...

56:48.500 --> 56:51.200
and coming back
just before she gets home.

56:51.300 --> 56:54.100
So my wife figures something's up...

56:54.200 --> 56:58.200
'cause I'm all the time yawning
and fall asleep as soon as I get in bed.

56:59.200 --> 57:03.100
So she goes across the hall
and sees this girl...

57:03.200 --> 57:06.365
and a big bunch of roses
in a jar.

57:06.400 --> 57:10.200
So she asks this girl,
"Where'd you get these roses?"

57:10.300 --> 57:13.700
That girl, she say, "I don't know.
They just come. "

57:14.500 --> 57:17.400
So my wife go down to the corner
to the florist...

57:17.500 --> 57:20.100
and asked did I buy
a big bunch of red roses.

57:20.900 --> 57:23.165
So he said, "Yes. "

57:23.200 --> 57:25.200
That's how wine broke up my marriage.

57:26.400 --> 57:30.100
- Sounds like it was roses to me.
- It was wine and roses.

57:30.135 --> 57:32.900
So now I'm out here
chopping weeds.

57:34.000 --> 57:36.300
I'll tell you girls something.

57:36.400 --> 57:39.100
- Esteban here...
- Can I have a match?

57:39.135 --> 57:41.800
Esteban here
is one hell of a fighter.

57:41.900 --> 57:44.900
Could've made champ,
except for his hands.

57:45.000 --> 57:49.000
Show them your hands. He hits
too hard for the size of his hands.

57:49.100 --> 57:52.600
You know what happened to me?
Mismanagement.

57:52.700 --> 57:55.000
Ruben.

57:55.100 --> 57:57.365
Remember my fight with Soto?

57:57.400 --> 57:59.400
To save a lousy
couple of hundred bucks...

57:59.500 --> 58:02.700
he flew me down to Panama
all by myself and blew my chance.

58:02.800 --> 58:05.800
- You know who Soto was then?
- Number five. He was good boy.

58:05.900 --> 58:09.800
Good? I had that bum hanging on.
I was knocking him silly for six rounds.

58:09.900 --> 58:11.800
So I'm back in my corner.

58:11.900 --> 58:13.900
I'm not paying attention
to anything they're doing to me.

58:14.000 --> 58:16.700
I know I got him. The bell rings.
I come out in the seventh.

58:16.800 --> 58:19.500
He pops me a couple of times, and
suddenly the referee stops the fight.

58:19.600 --> 58:21.500
There's blood pouring down me.
Can you believe that?

58:21.600 --> 58:24.500
Both of my eyes are cut.
Everybody's happy.

58:24.600 --> 58:27.700
The audience is screaming
their heads off.

58:27.800 --> 58:31.400
So they patch me up
and put me on a plane...

58:31.500 --> 58:33.400
and they're all smiles.

58:36.100 --> 58:38.800
I get back to Stockton. I go see Ruben.
He looks at the butterflies.

58:38.900 --> 58:42.100
He takes them off.
He takes a peek at the cuts...

58:42.200 --> 58:44.600
tells me they were done
with a razor.

58:44.700 --> 58:46.700
- Were they?
- They sure were.

58:46.800 --> 58:49.500
- How could he tell?
- By looking at them!

58:50.600 --> 58:54.300
Then we went out of Sacramento and filed
a complaint with the commissioner.

58:55.900 --> 58:57.800
- What happened?
- Nothing.

58:58.900 --> 59:00.700
I'm gonna start doing some running.

59:02.100 --> 59:05.000
If I get into shape,
I know I can still fight.

59:05.100 --> 59:07.350
- Why don't you then?
- I'm gonna.

59:07.385 --> 59:09.600
Yeah, sure.
I heard that one before.

59:09.700 --> 59:12.000
- I am.
- Sure, sure.

59:12.100 --> 59:14.900
- Screw you.
- Up yours, cowboy!

59:29.800 --> 59:31.800
Onion choppers, over here.

59:36.300 --> 59:38.300
Onion choppers, over here.

59:43.500 --> 59:45.500
How the hell are you?

59:45.600 --> 59:48.500
- What are you doing out here?
- Got a bum-paying job. Wife's pregnant.

59:48.600 --> 59:51.800
I came down to pick up a few extra
bucks, and I run into a mob like this.

59:51.900 --> 59:54.000
Come on.
I'll try to get you on.

59:54.100 --> 59:56.100
- Beautiful.
- You like walnuts?

59:56.200 --> 01:00:00.000
- Yeah, they're great.
- Did you go to the gym and see Ruben?

01:00:00.100 --> 01:00:03.600
- Yeah. Fought for a while.
- Yeah? How'd you do?

01:00:03.700 --> 01:00:06.350
- I won some, lost some.
- That's good.

01:00:06.385 --> 01:00:09.000
Keep it up, man.
You got the stuff.

01:00:09.100 --> 01:00:11.800
- Hey, I brought you a real hustler.
- You go out yesterday?

01:00:11.835 --> 01:00:15.000
Yeah. I was a tree-beater.

01:00:15.100 --> 01:00:17.500
I'll wait and see if all of
yesterday's crew comes back.

01:00:17.600 --> 01:00:19.700
You're making a big mistake
if you pass this guy up.

01:00:19.800 --> 01:00:23.400
- I'll give you my personal voucher.
- Get on, both of you.

01:00:58.300 --> 01:01:02.100
You must think I'm crazy working
out here like this, wasting my time.

01:01:02.135 --> 01:01:05.700
It's almost as good as roadwork
for getting back into shape...

01:01:05.800 --> 01:01:07.700
and you get paid for it.

01:01:10.200 --> 01:01:12.200
Another couple weeks
I'm gonna look for a fight.

01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:17.800
I get the fight, I get the money,
and I send for my wife.

01:01:20.400 --> 01:01:22.300
You know, Ernie...

01:01:23.700 --> 01:01:27.800
there are some women
that love you for yourself...

01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:31.300
but that doesn't last long.

01:01:41.500 --> 01:01:44.500
- Take care of that wife of yours.
- I'm trying.

01:01:44.600 --> 01:01:47.900
And listen, don't you let
anybody knock marriage.

01:01:47.935 --> 01:01:50.067
No, man.
It's got its compensations.

01:01:50.102 --> 01:01:52.200
That's a fact.
That's absolutely right.

01:01:52.300 --> 01:01:56.100
It's got its compensations.
That's it. That's absolutely it.

01:01:56.135 --> 01:01:59.100
It has got its compensations.
That's right.

01:02:00.100 --> 01:02:02.000
Come here.
Let me show you something.

01:02:06.400 --> 01:02:08.200
That's stacked.

01:02:08.300 --> 01:02:12.100
I gotta get myself together and get
down to the gym and start working out.

01:02:13.500 --> 01:02:16.365
Hey, maybe we could go down
to the gym together.

01:02:16.400 --> 01:02:20.600
- Sure, I'll go down there with you.
- I was in bad shape the last time.

01:02:20.700 --> 01:02:23.450
I can do it.
I can get back into shape.

01:02:23.485 --> 01:02:26.042
You should've seen
the things we had...

01:02:26.077 --> 01:02:28.600
the new car and the house
and everything.

01:02:28.700 --> 01:02:31.200
I am gonna be bad news
this time around.

01:02:31.300 --> 01:02:33.350
Bad...

01:02:33.385 --> 01:02:35.400
news!

01:02:38.600 --> 01:02:40.500
Time. Time.

01:02:40.600 --> 01:02:43.700
You're not jabbing right.
You gotta use your jab more.

01:02:43.800 --> 01:02:46.000
Hey, fellas.

01:02:46.100 --> 01:02:48.000
Hey, Gil.
How you doing?

01:02:49.700 --> 01:02:52.300
Hey, Ruben, look who's here.

01:02:54.900 --> 01:02:57.300
Well, will you look at this?

01:02:57.335 --> 01:03:00.000
Glad to see you.

01:03:00.100 --> 01:03:02.000
You're looking good.

01:03:03.800 --> 01:03:05.800
Hey, Ruben, how's it going?

01:03:07.200 --> 01:03:09.500
- Will you look at this?
- Hey, how are you?

01:03:09.600 --> 01:03:12.600
- Long time, no see.
- How'd you guys find your way up here?

01:03:12.700 --> 01:03:15.800
- What have you been doing?
- Picking nuts.

01:03:15.900 --> 01:03:18.500
You don't care what kind of company
you keep, do you?

01:03:18.600 --> 01:03:21.800
- I heard you got married.
- Yeah.

01:03:21.900 --> 01:03:25.500
Wow! How do you like that?
Come on. Time.

01:03:25.600 --> 01:03:28.200
Listen, I wanna pay you back
that $20 I borrowed from you.

01:03:28.300 --> 01:03:29.900
What?

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:32.000
I borrowed $20 from you.
Remember?

01:03:32.100 --> 01:03:35.300
- Yeah, but that was a long time ago.
- I know, but I want you to take it.

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:39.000
Yeah? You sure you can spare it?

01:03:39.035 --> 01:03:40.500
Oh, yeah.

01:03:41.900 --> 01:03:44.600
You come up to work out?

01:03:44.700 --> 01:03:47.150
I wanna start fighting again.

01:03:47.185 --> 01:03:49.600
You really gonna get into shape?

01:03:49.700 --> 01:03:51.665
I am really gonna get in shape.

01:03:51.700 --> 01:03:53.665
You can do it, baby.
You can do it.

01:03:53.700 --> 01:03:56.200
You're really looking good.
You look great.

01:03:56.235 --> 01:03:58.700
Get into your gym clothes.
Give me that.

01:04:08.300 --> 01:04:12.600
Mac, how are you? How's business?
I got something hot for you.

01:04:12.700 --> 01:04:14.800
Billy Tully's back in training.

01:04:14.900 --> 01:04:17.300
I'll tell you what I'd like for him,
a good tune-up fight.

01:04:18.700 --> 01:04:22.100
- Who'd pay to see a tune-up fight?
- He looks terrific, Mac.

01:04:22.200 --> 01:04:24.600
A couple of good wins,
he's ready for anybody.

01:04:24.700 --> 01:04:29.500
I don't mean match him with some bum.
Somebody to give him a good workout.

01:04:29.600 --> 01:04:32.100
- Tully won't draw.
- He's a good, clean athlete...

01:04:32.200 --> 01:04:34.100
with a fine record.

01:04:34.200 --> 01:04:36.165
Maybe I could use him
in a semi-windup.

01:04:36.200 --> 01:04:39.100
A semi-windup.
No, I can't put him in a semi.

01:04:39.200 --> 01:04:41.900
He's still got the old stuff.
He's got class.

01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:43.900
- He won't draw.
- Look...

01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:45.900
we can put a hometown boy
in every bout.

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:50.400
I got a fine Irish kid
that could turn pro for the opener.

01:04:50.500 --> 01:04:53.900
How about Arcadio Lucero? I could
use Tully in a main even with him.

01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:56.500
No, Lucero... I don't know.

01:04:56.600 --> 01:04:59.700
Lucero's a puncher.
What I meant was a good tune-up.

01:04:59.800 --> 01:05:01.800
Why should I put him in with Lucero?

01:05:01.900 --> 01:05:04.500
It might be different if he had
a couple of good tune-ups first.

01:05:05.600 --> 01:05:08.200
I think I can get you Lucero.

01:05:08.300 --> 01:05:11.200
Not that I think
he could ever nail Tully.

01:05:11.300 --> 01:05:13.900
Well, I tell you,
I think I can get Lucero.

01:05:15.500 --> 01:05:17.900
It would be a good win on his record.

01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:21.100
I could phone Mexico City
and see if he's available.

01:05:30.700 --> 01:05:32.600
Supper's almost ready.

01:05:41.900 --> 01:05:43.900
Can I have a robe?

01:05:43.935 --> 01:05:45.200
What?

01:05:45.300 --> 01:05:47.200
Can I have a robe?

01:05:55.200 --> 01:05:57.000
How do you like your steak?

01:05:58.700 --> 01:06:00.100
I don't care.

01:06:20.300 --> 01:06:22.465
Is Earl out of the bucket?

01:06:22.500 --> 01:06:26.200
- His box is gone.
- Earl's box?

01:06:26.300 --> 01:06:28.800
- Did Earl come over here today?
- Yep.

01:06:28.900 --> 01:06:32.500
- Why didn't you tell me so?
- I just woke up.

01:06:32.600 --> 01:06:34.500
I didn't have a chance
to open my mouth.

01:06:34.600 --> 01:06:37.300
- Yeah.
- He just picked up his stuff and left.

01:06:37.400 --> 01:06:40.500
Mm-hmm. After he found out
he couldn't move back in, huh?

01:06:40.600 --> 01:06:42.600
He didn't mention moving in.

01:06:44.100 --> 01:06:48.700
- Then why'd he come over?
- I told you, to get his clothes.

01:06:48.735 --> 01:06:51.165
He already knew
that you and I were together.

01:06:51.200 --> 01:06:54.100
- How'd he know that?
- What are all these questions?

01:06:54.135 --> 01:06:56.100
He came by the day he got out.

01:06:58.700 --> 01:07:01.300
- Why didn't you tell me?
- I guess I forgot.

01:07:02.300 --> 01:07:04.200
- Yeah, that's a good one.
- What?

01:07:04.300 --> 01:07:06.300
- Nothing.
- I heard what you said.

01:07:06.400 --> 01:07:07.700
They why'd you ask?

01:07:09.400 --> 01:07:11.400
You don't trust me, do you?

01:07:11.500 --> 01:07:14.400
Look, Oma, all I'm trying to do
is cook our supper.

01:07:14.500 --> 01:07:17.200
Oh, aren't you wonderful?

01:07:19.700 --> 01:07:22.500
If I didn't cook it,
we wouldn't eat.

01:07:22.600 --> 01:07:25.200
Nobody asked you
to fix me any supper.

01:07:25.300 --> 01:07:27.200
Yeah, I know.
You'd just as soon drink yours.

01:07:27.300 --> 01:07:30.800
If you don't wanna fix me any,
than you don't have to.

01:07:30.900 --> 01:07:32.800
I'm making it for you.

01:07:35.100 --> 01:07:37.500
Then I won't eat it
if you feel that way about it.

01:07:37.600 --> 01:07:39.800
I want you to eat it.

01:07:39.900 --> 01:07:42.400
I cooked it
because I want you to eat!

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:47.600
I didn't say anything,
and you had to go and get mad.

01:07:47.700 --> 01:07:51.500
Jesus Christ, Oma. Come on.
Eat your supper before it gets cold.

01:07:53.700 --> 01:07:56.300
I don't take orders from you.

01:08:00.100 --> 01:08:02.100
You need your protein.

01:08:02.200 --> 01:08:05.900
I'm not gonna eat with somebody
that talks to me the way you do.

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:08.000
You wanna starve to death?

01:08:08.800 --> 01:08:11.300
That'd solve everything
for you, wouldn't it?

01:08:13.700 --> 01:08:17.100
Oma, I just asked you
a simple question. Jesus.

01:08:17.200 --> 01:08:20.100
Come on.
Eat your dinner before it gets cold.

01:08:21.899 --> 01:08:23.800
Maybe I don't wanna eat.

01:08:25.800 --> 01:08:28.100
All right. Forget it.
Just forget it.

01:08:28.135 --> 01:08:30.865
Go on.
Go hungry if you want to.

01:08:30.899 --> 01:08:32.899
I make you a good dinner.
You don't even appreciate it.

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:36.399
This is good food.

01:08:36.500 --> 01:08:40.399
Go ahead and starve to death.
See if I care. Just forget about it.

01:08:42.399 --> 01:08:45.165
All right.
I'll have a little.

01:08:45.200 --> 01:08:47.200
- No, I don't want you to.
- No, I want it.

01:08:47.300 --> 01:08:49.200
- I don't want you to eat.
- I wanna eat it.

01:08:49.300 --> 01:08:51.200
- No, I don't want you to eat it.
- I want it!

01:08:51.300 --> 01:08:53.200
I don't want you to eat it!
I don't want you to eat it!

01:08:53.300 --> 01:08:55.800
Now you won't even
let me eat my dinner!

01:08:59.700 --> 01:09:01.100
All right.

01:09:04.399 --> 01:09:05.800
Eat.

01:09:35.899 --> 01:09:37.300
Well?

01:09:38.800 --> 01:09:40.800
- How do you like it?
- What?

01:09:42.700 --> 01:09:45.600
- Nothing. Forget it.
- Oh, for Christ's sake.

01:09:45.700 --> 01:09:48.000
Don't ask something
and then not say what you mean.

01:09:48.035 --> 01:09:51.000
- Your supper.
- All right.

01:09:51.035 --> 01:09:52.600
It's fine.

01:09:54.900 --> 01:09:58.800
I thought you'd know what I meant since
you're not having any trouble eating it.

01:09:58.900 --> 01:10:01.700
Nobody can eat with you
sitting across the table!

01:10:07.900 --> 01:10:09.900
All right, Oma.

01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:12.600
I give up.

01:10:13.700 --> 01:10:16.900
All I've been trying to do
is get you to eat your supper.

01:10:18.300 --> 01:10:22.900
If you don't want my company,
just say so. I'll let you alone.

01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:25.700
- Where you going?
- Take a walk around the block.

01:10:25.800 --> 01:10:28.600
- Can I go with you?
- No.

01:10:28.700 --> 01:10:30.900
Let you eat in peace.
That's what you want.

01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:33.000
You're going out for a drink
and you're gonna leave me here?

01:10:33.100 --> 01:10:35.100
I'm fighting in a week.
Do you think I'd take a drink?

01:10:35.135 --> 01:10:37.517
Wait a minute.
Let me get my shoes.

01:10:37.552 --> 01:10:39.900
Billy, wait...
Billy, wait, please!

01:10:50.600 --> 01:10:53.200
<i>- Hello.
- Is that you, Ruben?</i>

01:10:53.300 --> 01:10:56.000
<i>- Who is this speaking?
- You know something?</i>

01:10:56.100 --> 01:10:59.900
<i>You're not worried about me,
and I don't give a damn about you.</i>

01:10:59.935 --> 01:11:03.200
<i>You never will give a damn,
so why should I?</i>

01:11:03.300 --> 01:11:07.900
<i>You know, if you'd gone to Panama
with me, everything would be different.</i>

01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:10.000
Listen, where are you?
What's the problem?

01:11:10.100 --> 01:11:13.500
<i>What do you mean, what is the problem?
What's your problem?</i>

01:11:13.600 --> 01:11:16.000
Just hold on. Where are you?
What's wrong?

01:11:35.700 --> 01:11:37.600
Hi, Billy.

01:11:41.100 --> 01:11:42.500
Hello, Ruben.

01:11:42.600 --> 01:11:45.100
What are you doing
out on the town?

01:11:45.200 --> 01:11:47.200
Hey, Ruben,
can I buy you a drink?

01:11:47.235 --> 01:11:50.700
No, nothing, Billy. Nothing.

01:11:50.800 --> 01:11:53.700
Hey, Ruben,
I'm really glad to see you.

01:11:53.800 --> 01:11:56.400
I need somebody to talk to.
I need your good advice.

01:11:56.500 --> 01:11:58.700
I am in a mess.

01:11:58.800 --> 01:12:00.700
What's the trouble?

01:12:00.800 --> 01:12:04.700
Oh, this woman of mine,
she's just off her gourd.

01:12:04.800 --> 01:12:08.900
I can't take it anymore. I need my
peace of mind. I'm training for a fight.

01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:12.500
- Is that so?
- Yeah.

01:12:12.600 --> 01:12:16.600
I can't take it anymore, Ruben.

01:12:16.700 --> 01:12:19.400
I can't even sleep
in the same bed with her.

01:12:19.500 --> 01:12:24.100
Every time she opens her mouth
I think I'm gonna go crazy!

01:12:26.500 --> 01:12:30.200
- She's a lush.
- Leave her. Stay at my place tonight.

01:12:30.300 --> 01:12:33.400
I wish I could. It's not that easy.
All my clothes are over there.

01:12:33.435 --> 01:12:35.765
I'll get you some clothes,
and I'll give you an advance.

01:12:35.800 --> 01:12:38.400
But if you're really gonna leave her,
you leave her right now.

01:12:39.100 --> 01:12:40.700
Right now!

01:12:44.300 --> 01:12:47.100
Right. You're dead right.

01:12:47.200 --> 01:12:49.100
- You're right. I know you're right.
- Come on.

01:12:49.200 --> 01:12:51.600
Come on. I'll get you a room
somewhere tomorrow.

01:12:51.700 --> 01:12:53.565
All right.

01:12:53.600 --> 01:12:56.900
She's just destroying me, Rube.

01:12:57.000 --> 01:12:59.000
Hey, listen to me.
Wait a minute.

01:12:59.100 --> 01:13:01.000
I wanna tell you something.

01:13:04.400 --> 01:13:07.465
Ever since my wife left me...

01:13:07.500 --> 01:13:11.600
it has just been one mess
after another.

01:13:14.300 --> 01:13:15.900
You know...

01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:20.200
the only time
I was ever really happy, I...

01:13:24.100 --> 01:13:28.200
You know something, Rube?
In four days, I'm gonna be 30.

01:13:29.600 --> 01:13:31.500
Come on, let's go.

01:13:31.600 --> 01:13:33.900
All right. Okay.

01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:36.900
Come on. Attaboy. All right.

01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:38.900
You need help?
Okay, baby.

01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:40.600
Come on.

01:13:42.400 --> 01:13:44.800
You know,
I really appreciate it, Rube.

01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:48.000
<i>Lodi and Sacramento.</i>

01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:05.000
<i>The Lodi-Sacramento bus
is now loading passengers.</i>

01:14:05.100 --> 01:14:07.365
<i>Please remain inside the terminal...</i>

01:14:07.400 --> 01:14:12.100
<i>until the driver picks up your ticket
at door number four.</i>

01:14:12.200 --> 01:14:14.400
<i>Have a pleasant day.</i>

01:15:12.300 --> 01:15:14.900
Billy, better start to warm up.

01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:17.800
- Hurry up. He's gotta warm up.
- You're on right now.

01:15:17.900 --> 01:15:20.665
Don't get excited, Mac.

01:15:20.700 --> 01:15:23.000
- How do you feel, Tully?
- I feel okay.

01:15:23.100 --> 01:15:25.700
- Is he all clear from the doctor?
- He's all set. He's gonna win big.

01:15:25.735 --> 01:15:27.965
- How's the crowd?
- Fair.

01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:31.000
- You're on next, so good luck, Tully.
- Thanks, Mac.

01:15:35.700 --> 01:15:38.900
You all ready to go, Lucero?
Gonna give them another good show?

01:15:44.100 --> 01:15:46.100
He feels good. He's ready.

01:15:46.200 --> 01:15:49.000
- He seen the doctor yet?
- Yeah. He says he's in good shape.

01:15:49.035 --> 01:15:51.100
You got some fans out there, Lucero.

01:15:51.200 --> 01:15:53.700
Give them a good show.
I'd like to have you back here.

01:16:12.900 --> 01:16:15.600
Ladies and gentlemen,
your attention, please.

01:16:15.700 --> 01:16:18.200
The main event.
Ten rounds.

01:16:18.300 --> 01:16:20.200
Wearing the blue trunks...

01:16:20.300 --> 01:16:24.200
weighing 175 pounds...

01:16:24.300 --> 01:16:26.700
the pride of Stockton...

01:16:26.800 --> 01:16:29.200
Billy Tully!

01:16:30.700 --> 01:16:33.500
And from Mexico City...

01:16:33.600 --> 01:16:36.100
Arcadio Lucero!

01:16:38.600 --> 01:16:43.100
And the referee for the main event,
Al Giovanni.

01:17:18.300 --> 01:17:22.200
Come on, come on! Hit him in
the head! The head! Hit him!

01:17:59.500 --> 01:18:02.300
Break. Come on, boys.

01:18:07.700 --> 01:18:09.300
Break. Break.

01:18:15.900 --> 01:18:17.800
Go back to the corners.

01:18:25.600 --> 01:18:28.900
Stay away from him. Move him around.
Don't slug with him.

01:18:28.935 --> 01:18:31.400
- He's laying for you.
- He's weak downstairs.

01:18:36.900 --> 01:18:39.700
- Don't trade with him.
- I hurt him downstairs.

01:18:39.735 --> 01:18:41.400
Don't gamble.

01:18:41.500 --> 01:18:43.400
- Seconds out.
- Get him up.

01:18:44.600 --> 01:18:46.400
Seconds out.

01:19:24.700 --> 01:19:27.100
Break. Step back. Step back.

01:19:51.500 --> 01:19:55.300
- Stay down, Billy!
- One, two, three...

01:19:55.335 --> 01:19:56.900
- Stay down, Billy!
- four...

01:19:57.000 --> 01:19:59.400
five, six...

01:19:59.500 --> 01:20:02.600
- seven, eight...
- Get up, Billy!

01:20:02.700 --> 01:20:04.300
Get up!

01:20:05.700 --> 01:20:08.165
Are you all right, kid?

01:20:08.200 --> 01:20:10.200
All right.
Come on, let's go!

01:20:22.900 --> 01:20:25.000
Right here. Come on, kid.
Let's go.

01:20:25.100 --> 01:20:27.000
Come on, sit down.

01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:37.000
- Is that eye all right?
- Yeah, he's all right.

01:20:37.100 --> 01:20:39.000
- Make sure.
- He's okay.

01:20:41.100 --> 01:20:44.400
Tully, stay away from him.
Stay away from those rights.

01:20:44.435 --> 01:20:48.167
Tie him up.
Stick him in the ribs, okay?

01:20:48.202 --> 01:20:51.900
- All right. Seconds out.
- Seconds out.

01:20:51.935 --> 01:20:55.200
Move! Move!
Move, baby, move!

01:21:05.700 --> 01:21:08.100
Come on.
Clean break. Clean break.

01:21:27.600 --> 01:21:29.500
Break. Come on, boys.

01:22:22.400 --> 01:22:24.400
Break. Break.

01:22:24.500 --> 01:22:26.100
Move. Move.

01:22:52.600 --> 01:22:57.600
Five, six, seven, eight...

01:22:57.635 --> 01:22:59.600
You all right, kid?

01:23:16.900 --> 01:23:19.700
Winner by technical knockout...

01:23:19.800 --> 01:23:24.200
time: two minutes and thirteen seconds
of the third round...

01:23:24.300 --> 01:23:26.900
Billy Tully!

01:23:34.500 --> 01:23:37.100
- Did I get knocked out?
- No, we won, we won.

01:23:37.135 --> 01:23:39.500
You won, baby! You won!

01:23:59.500 --> 01:24:01.700
Here he is!

01:24:01.800 --> 01:24:03.700
There he is.

01:24:05.300 --> 01:24:08.000
- Congratulations.
- Congratulations, Billy.

01:24:08.100 --> 01:24:10.100
Kiss him, honey. Kiss him.

01:24:10.200 --> 01:24:12.800
- Congratulations.
- You put on a good fight.

01:24:12.900 --> 01:24:15.600
Good fight?
This guy is sensational.

01:24:15.700 --> 01:24:18.800
He just pulled the upset of the year.
This guy is great.

01:24:18.835 --> 01:24:21.600
I defy anybody to say
this guy is not great.

01:24:21.700 --> 01:24:24.900
First fight in two years,
he gets himself into perfect condition.

01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:27.500
He doesn't smoke, Mac. You know that?
Never touches tobacco.

01:24:27.600 --> 01:24:30.800
He's ready for anybody.
We got a real winner here.

01:24:30.900 --> 01:24:33.900
He's the most colorful attraction
in Northern California.

01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:36.900
What'd you think of this kid?
Wasn't he fantastic?

01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:39.600
First pro fight,
he's cool as ice in there.

01:24:41.800 --> 01:24:44.600
Don't give it all
to them baby doctors.

01:24:44.635 --> 01:24:47.100
If it's a boy, call him Babe.

01:24:47.200 --> 01:24:49.765
- How can he miss?
- Real good. Real good.

01:24:49.800 --> 01:24:52.300
- Is he a lightweight or a heavyweight?
- A heavyweight.

01:24:52.400 --> 01:24:54.800
- Good night, sweetheart.
- Good night. I'll see you.

01:24:54.900 --> 01:24:57.900
- Good night, kids. Take care.
- See you, Bill.

01:24:58.800 --> 01:25:01.600
Babe, take my missus home, will you?
I'll drop Tully off.

01:25:01.700 --> 01:25:04.000
Come on.

01:25:04.100 --> 01:25:06.500
He looked good out there.
That third round...

01:25:40.400 --> 01:25:43.100
We earned $241.
You've been off too long.

01:25:43.135 --> 01:25:45.765
Next time you'll draw
three times that much.

01:25:45.800 --> 01:25:49.150
- What's my cut come to?
- I gave you all those advances.

01:25:49.185 --> 01:25:52.500
I gotta collect some of that.
We got you on your feet now.

01:25:52.600 --> 01:25:55.000
In three or four weeks
you'll be ready to go again.

01:25:55.100 --> 01:25:58.500
I'll tell you what. Why don't I
just keep paying your room and board?

01:25:58.535 --> 01:26:01.600
- I'm not drinking anymore.
- I know, Billy. I know.

01:26:01.635 --> 01:26:04.265
I'm not gonna blow any of it.

01:26:04.300 --> 01:26:08.300
Look, you take your cut and just
let me pay my own bills, okay?

01:26:08.400 --> 01:26:10.400
Anything you say.

01:26:15.400 --> 01:26:17.400
Here you go.

01:26:21.600 --> 01:26:24.165
Only a hundred bucks?

01:26:24.200 --> 01:26:27.900
That's all my sweat and blood
is worth, a lousy 100 bucks?

01:26:27.935 --> 01:26:29.865
That's hardly worth the trouble.

01:26:29.900 --> 01:26:33.100
I gave you those advances with the
agreement they come out of your purse.

01:26:33.200 --> 01:26:35.900
I got four kids. Once we make
another match, I'll stake you.

01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:37.900
- Oh, yeah.
- Don't get out that door!

01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:39.900
You'll get run over!
Get out this door!

01:26:41.200 --> 01:26:43.500
What'd you do that for?
Why didn't you slide over?

01:26:43.600 --> 01:26:46.400
- What do you care?
- You can get run into out there.

01:26:46.500 --> 01:26:49.600
You're just looking out for me
every minute, aren't you?

01:26:49.635 --> 01:26:51.900
Huh? Except when
it comes time to pay off!

01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:54.900
I'll talk to Mac. He'll put you
on again in two or three weeks.

01:26:54.935 --> 01:26:58.000
- With this cut?
- It'll heal.

01:26:58.100 --> 01:27:00.200
You know where I got this cut, Ruben?

01:27:00.300 --> 01:27:03.350
This is the same place they cut me
with that razor blade...

01:27:03.385 --> 01:27:06.400
when you sent me down to Panama
to fight Soto all by myself...

01:27:06.500 --> 01:27:09.200
'cause you were too tight to
come down and work in my corner.

01:27:09.235 --> 01:27:12.200
That's not old scar tissue.
It's a new cut.

01:27:12.300 --> 01:27:14.200
Yeah, that's what you'd say,
all right.

01:27:14.300 --> 01:27:16.500
Would you get out of
the middle of the road there?

01:27:16.600 --> 01:27:18.100
Yeah, yeah.

01:28:10.500 --> 01:28:11.900
What you want?

01:28:15.600 --> 01:28:19.800
- I just come to get my things.
- I live here, and I pay the rent.

01:28:22.800 --> 01:28:25.200
- Yeah.
- Got your things in a box.

01:28:25.300 --> 01:28:27.200
You're all ready to go.

01:28:29.900 --> 01:28:34.050
Oh, Christ, Mary and Joseph,
look who's here.

01:28:34.085 --> 01:28:38.200
- Thanks.
- I'm wearing one of your T-shirts.

01:28:38.300 --> 01:28:40.900
- I'll take it off for you.
- No, don't bother. I've got plenty.

01:28:40.935 --> 01:28:44.100
I got my own.
Just wasn't none clean today.

01:28:44.200 --> 01:28:46.400
What's yours is yours.

01:28:46.500 --> 01:28:48.400
Oma wanted me
to throw your stuff out...

01:28:49.600 --> 01:28:52.000
but I say a man's stuff
is his stuff.

01:28:52.100 --> 01:28:55.400
When he shows up around here, I'm gonna
send him off with what he come for.

01:28:55.500 --> 01:28:59.000
- You can take that box and shove it!
- Hush now. He just come for his things.

01:28:59.100 --> 01:29:01.600
- He's leaving.
- Don't you hush me, you bums!

01:29:01.700 --> 01:29:03.900
- What do you know about it anyway?
- Don't listen to her.

01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:06.600
- She's been drinking.
- Get that garbage out of here!

01:29:06.700 --> 01:29:09.900
- We've been out on the town tonight.
- Take the shirt off a man's back.

01:29:10.000 --> 01:29:12.300
If that isn't just so perfect!
If that isn't just like him!

01:29:12.400 --> 01:29:16.200
She just likes to blow off steam.
Don't listen to her. We gets along.

01:29:16.300 --> 01:29:18.800
How I handle her,
I just don't pay her no mind.

01:29:18.900 --> 01:29:21.400
The thing you got to understand
about her, she's a juice head.

01:29:21.500 --> 01:29:25.000
I know.
She won't eat either.

01:29:25.100 --> 01:29:28.300
Yeah, that's on account of
her unhappy life and all that shit.

01:29:29.300 --> 01:29:32.800
Nothing I can do about that.
So I don't let it worry me none.

01:29:34.300 --> 01:29:36.700
Look like you had you a fight.
How you come out?

01:29:37.500 --> 01:29:39.400
- I won.
- Is that right?

01:29:39.500 --> 01:29:41.865
I seen you on the posters.

01:29:41.900 --> 01:29:44.500
I like to catch a good fight
now and then.

01:29:44.535 --> 01:29:47.065
- Maybe I'll catch you some time.
- Good.

01:29:47.100 --> 01:29:50.400
But I don't need you coming around
here no more. She don't wanna see you.

01:29:50.500 --> 01:29:53.100
Oma, you wanna see this man?

01:29:54.200 --> 01:29:56.700
- Christ!
- See how it is?

01:29:59.500 --> 01:30:01.400
You got your stuff.

01:30:24.400 --> 01:30:26.700
- You got a match?
- I don't have one.

01:30:43.700 --> 01:30:45.600
- Hey, man.
- Hey, how's it going?

01:30:45.700 --> 01:30:48.700
- All right. How you doing?
- All right.

01:30:48.800 --> 01:30:52.400
- You look like you had a fight.
- Yeah, I just one a decision in Reno.

01:30:52.435 --> 01:30:54.565
Is that right?

01:30:54.600 --> 01:30:57.200
Congratulations. Nice going.

01:30:57.300 --> 01:30:59.800
- Why don't we have a drink?
- No, not for me.

01:30:59.900 --> 01:31:02.300
- How you been keeping, man?
- Come on.

01:31:02.335 --> 01:31:04.700
No, I gotta get home
to my wife and kid.

01:31:04.800 --> 01:31:08.900
What's the matter? You won't even
have a drink with your old buddy.

01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:11.000
But I don't drink.

01:31:11.100 --> 01:31:13.800
Yeah, I know.
You only win decisions.

01:31:13.835 --> 01:31:16.500
Do you know how many KOs
I had in a row?

01:31:16.600 --> 01:31:18.500
A whole long string.

01:31:20.200 --> 01:31:22.400
You mind if I say something personal?

01:31:22.500 --> 01:31:26.300
- No, go ahead.
- Can I be frank?

01:31:26.400 --> 01:31:28.300
It's just my own opinion.

01:31:30.100 --> 01:31:33.500
You remember that first time
that we met down at the YMCA?

01:31:35.200 --> 01:31:36.800
Yeah.

01:31:36.900 --> 01:31:39.600
I said to myself then...
I said...

01:31:41.000 --> 01:31:46.200
"Now, there is a guy
that is soft in the center. "

01:31:55.800 --> 01:31:57.765
I don't know. Forget it.

01:31:57.800 --> 01:32:01.100
Great. Fine. Congratulations.

01:32:01.200 --> 01:32:05.100
Listen, you got everything
going for you, you know that?

01:32:05.200 --> 01:32:07.500
You're young, and you got a wife,
and you got a kid...

01:32:07.600 --> 01:32:11.100
- A little boy.
- Yeah, and you got a good reach too.

01:32:14.100 --> 01:32:17.600
- Hey, no hard feelings, huh?
- No, man. No hard feelings.

01:32:17.700 --> 01:32:20.700
You're right about that drink.

01:32:20.735 --> 01:32:23.367
Can I buy you a cup of coffee?

01:32:23.402 --> 01:32:26.000
Yeah, let's go get some coffee.

01:32:28.500 --> 01:32:30.500
So, why haven't you been training?

01:32:30.600 --> 01:32:32.500
Oh, I don't know.

01:32:32.600 --> 01:32:34.500
I've been thinking about it.

01:33:04.100 --> 01:33:05.900
- Coffee?
- Coffee.

01:33:06.000 --> 01:33:07.400
Please.

01:33:19.400 --> 01:33:22.800
How'd you like to
wake up in the morning...

01:33:22.835 --> 01:33:24.800
and be him?

01:33:31.500 --> 01:33:33.000
Jesus.

01:33:34.900 --> 01:33:36.500
The waste.

01:33:41.800 --> 01:33:44.400
Before you can get rolling...

01:33:44.500 --> 01:33:47.500
your life makes a beehive
for the drain.

01:33:55.800 --> 01:33:58.200
- Thanks.
- Thank you.

01:34:04.500 --> 01:34:07.200
Maybe he's happy.

01:34:09.500 --> 01:34:11.400
Maybe we're all happy.

01:34:19.100 --> 01:34:20.600
Right?

01:34:32.300 --> 01:34:34.300
Do you think he was
ever young once?

01:34:37.200 --> 01:34:39.400
No.

01:34:39.500 --> 01:34:41.400
Maybe he was.

01:35:12.000 --> 01:35:14.200
Hey, buddy, I'm gonna take off.

01:35:14.300 --> 01:35:16.300
Hey, stick around.

01:35:16.400 --> 01:35:18.300
Talk a while.
