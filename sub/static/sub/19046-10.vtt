00:01.301 --> 00:03.469
[ Charlie ]
So he's in the law house,
right--

00:03.471 --> 00:06.405
[ Dennis ]
Oh, please stop talking.
Just let me finish my story.

00:06.407 --> 00:10.109
Describing an episode
of Law and Order in full
detail is not a story.

00:10.111 --> 00:13.746
No, it's so good.
First of all, I think I could
be a really good lawyer.

00:13.748 --> 00:15.647
I'm better than Sam Waterston,
I'll tell you that much.

00:15.649 --> 00:18.150
You want to be a lawyer?
Don't you think you should
know how to read or write?

00:18.152 --> 00:22.254
Objection. Hearsay. That's
lawyer talk. That's the kind
of stuff you have to do.

00:22.256 --> 00:24.723
That serial killer killed
another woman last night.
[ Charlie ] Really?

00:24.725 --> 00:30.696
Yeah. It says here
he's targeting young,
attractive blondes.

00:30.698 --> 00:33.832
Okay, that's it.
I'm not closing the bar
by myself anymore.

00:33.834 --> 00:37.536
Why? What are you
worried about?
You don't fit the description.

00:37.538 --> 00:39.304
- I fit the description.
- No, no. Young, attractive--

00:39.306 --> 00:43.142
- I fit the description.
- All right. Well, first of all,
you're too big, Dee.

00:43.144 --> 00:44.843
You're like a--
You're like a female
Larry Bird.

00:44.845 --> 00:46.879
[ Dennis ]
There's too much of you.
There's not too much of me.

00:46.881 --> 00:48.814
- He would never finish the job.
- He'd get the job done.

00:48.816 --> 00:52.117
He'd spend his whole night
hacking and sawing.
Then he still wouldn't be done.

00:52.119 --> 00:54.486
He would open his box
of tools and say, "What tools
am I gonna use for this?"

00:54.488 --> 00:57.723
- He could use normal tools.
- He'd look at that pile of
bones and flesh and say--

00:57.725 --> 01:01.360
"How many people have
I murdered tonight?"
"How is this just one person?"

01:01.362 --> 01:04.863
Mm-hmm.
Well, guess what.
You're Larry Bird.

01:04.865 --> 01:08.333
That's okay, 'cause Larry
Bird's an excellent player.
He's an awesome player.

01:08.335 --> 01:10.469
- What's up, bitches?
- Hey-yo!

01:10.471 --> 01:11.904
Hey. This guy,
he got laid last night.

01:11.906 --> 01:14.606
- What? No, I didn't.
- Yeah, you did.
You didn't come home.

01:14.608 --> 01:17.242
-Yes, I did.
-You're wearing the same clothes
you were wearing yesterday.

01:17.244 --> 01:20.212
- That's what you were
wearing yesterday.
- These are different clothes.

01:20.214 --> 01:23.215
Where'd you get those
scratches on your neck?
What?

01:23.217 --> 01:25.551
You got scratches
on your neck.
No, I don't.

01:25.553 --> 01:27.619
- Oh, let me see.
- No. What?

01:27.621 --> 01:30.722
I gotta take a piss.
I don't have any--

01:30.724 --> 01:33.759
You guys are-- Huh?

01:34.527 --> 01:36.161
Well, that was weird.
Wow.

01:36.163 --> 01:40.132
He's been acting
like that a lot lately.
What's gotten into him?

01:40.134 --> 01:43.335
Serial killing.

02:14.501 --> 02:19.371
If I'm gonna prove that Mac
is guilty, I gotta apply
a little pressure.

02:19.373 --> 02:22.274
I'm gonna get a chain saw.
A chain saw?

02:22.276 --> 02:24.910
You can't just torture
someone 'cause you think
they're guilty.

02:24.912 --> 02:26.912
Oh, don't give me
that liberal bullshit.

02:26.914 --> 02:30.249
Mac is not the serial killer.
He's not smart enough.
He's a dumb person.

02:30.251 --> 02:31.683
And dumb people are not capable
of serial killing.

02:31.685 --> 02:35.687
Oh, yeah? What about
the scratches on his neck?
I got a hunch about this.

02:35.689 --> 02:37.589
You got a hunch?
Frank's got a hunch.
Let's just convict him.

02:37.591 --> 02:41.727
Let's carve our best friend to
pieces with a chainsaw based on
a hunch. Jesus Christ, Frank.

02:41.729 --> 02:44.429
Dee, why don't you and I use
a little textbook psychology?

02:44.431 --> 02:47.666
And that'll lead us
to the real serial
killer's doorstep.

02:47.668 --> 02:49.468
Are you all gonna go
against me on this?

02:49.470 --> 02:52.371
Sorry, Larry Bird.
Stop trying to use
the Larry Bird thing.

02:52.373 --> 02:54.740
[ Dee ]
I don't know. Shh.

02:54.742 --> 02:56.708
What are you guys
talking about?

02:56.710 --> 02:57.676
Nothing.
Nothing.

02:57.678 --> 03:00.579
Okay, I forgot about
this thing that I gotta do,
that I gotta take care of.

03:00.581 --> 03:04.216
I was thinking about it in the
bathroom. And I figured I should
just go deal with it now.

03:04.218 --> 03:07.953
So I'm just gonna go
deal with it now. I guess
I'll see you guys later?

03:07.955 --> 03:09.254
Okay, bye.

03:09.256 --> 03:12.791
[ Laughs ]
Oh, if I prove
that he is guilty,

03:12.793 --> 03:16.628
I am gonna torture
the shit out of him.

03:33.880 --> 03:36.648
Hey, you.
We need to talk.

03:36.650 --> 03:39.051
I don't understand.
I thought we talked about this.

03:39.053 --> 03:40.919
We did. It's just
that my friends
are getting suspicious.

03:40.921 --> 03:45.290
And I cannot have them find out
that we are dating again.
[ Scoffs ] Why not?

03:45.292 --> 03:50.195
Because of your-- Oh, God.
Situation down there.

03:50.197 --> 03:52.998
You mean my penis?
Well, you don't have
to say it out loud.

03:53.000 --> 03:54.533
I told you.
I'm getting rid of it.

03:54.535 --> 03:58.036
I know. But when, dude?
I feel like I've been putting
a lot of time in here.

03:58.038 --> 04:01.373
Soon. It takes time.
Look, I know that
it takes time.

04:01.375 --> 04:03.075
I've been reading up
on the subject.

04:03.077 --> 04:06.645
But maybe we should just
take it easy until then.

04:06.647 --> 04:09.748
Because of the penis?
Oh, boy. There it is.

04:09.750 --> 04:11.750
The penis.
Yes. Because of the pen--

04:11.752 --> 04:13.552
Okay, listen.
Here's the deal.

04:13.554 --> 04:16.054
I feel like we make out,
and it's great.
I mean, really great.

04:16.056 --> 04:18.790
But then things
start to get hot and
heavy and you scratch me.

04:18.792 --> 04:21.526
Which is cool.
But you're really
strong, and it hurts.

04:21.528 --> 04:26.498
And sometimes--
just sometimes--
I bump up against it.

04:26.500 --> 04:29.668
And I-- I just can't
handle that.

04:29.670 --> 04:33.405
Really? Because you seem
like you can handle anything.

04:33.407 --> 04:35.874
I mean, with that body.

04:37.076 --> 04:40.612
Well. Yeah, I mean,
physically, sure.

04:40.614 --> 04:43.849
I mean, I guess
I can handle pretty
much any situation.

04:43.851 --> 04:48.654
I mean, I do...
work out. So--

04:48.656 --> 04:50.856
You sure do.

04:51.557 --> 04:54.693
[ Whistling ]
I don't know. He's been
in there a long time.

04:54.695 --> 04:56.762
You think he's
chopping up bodies?
He's not chopping up anything.

04:56.764 --> 05:01.633
He's not a serial killer.
Hey, man. What'd I tell you
about bringing that chain saw?

05:01.635 --> 05:03.435
Hey, you want to take
a picture with it?

05:03.437 --> 05:05.937
No. We're on an invest--
Do you have a camera?
Yeah.

05:05.939 --> 05:08.040
Oh, yeah. Absolutely then.
[ Laughs ]

05:08.042 --> 05:10.575
Yeah.
All right. How's this look?
Does this look cool?

05:10.577 --> 05:13.111
Hold it closer to your face
and look really crazy.

05:13.113 --> 05:14.446
Like I'm killing somebody?

05:14.448 --> 05:16.815
Let me start it
and get my tongue--
Put your tongue there.

05:16.817 --> 05:19.785
There he is.
There he is.
Oh!

05:19.787 --> 05:21.720
We got ourselves
a serial killer.

05:21.722 --> 05:23.455
No, you don't have anything.
That's inconclusive, Frank.

05:23.457 --> 05:26.558
Look, look. He's guilty
as sin. Look at him.
He's sneaking around.

05:26.560 --> 05:28.126
You gotta have hard
evidence. You don't have
any hard evidence.

05:28.128 --> 05:32.531
I'll tell you what you do have.
You got a camera. So let's
snap one off, all right?

05:32.533 --> 05:34.599
Okay, like this?
[ Moaning ]
Okay, right.

05:34.601 --> 05:37.436
Put your tongue closer
to the blade.

05:39.105 --> 05:40.739
Dennis!

05:40.741 --> 05:42.741
Dee. What the hell
are you doing?

05:42.743 --> 05:44.843
Get outta here.
You're gonna blow my cover.

05:44.845 --> 05:46.645
This seems
extraordinarily dangerous.

05:46.647 --> 05:47.946
Dee, that is the point
of being here.

05:47.948 --> 05:50.916
This is the area of the highest
concentration of murders
by the serial killer.

05:50.918 --> 05:54.453
I know. That's why I feel like
a sitting duck out there.
You volunteered for this, Sis.

05:54.455 --> 05:57.989
If you recall, I didn't
want to use you as the bait.
You do not fit the profile.

05:57.991 --> 06:01.660
I fit the profile, Dennis!
That's the right attitude.
Now pull these out or something.

06:01.662 --> 06:04.596
You need to look sexy
for this guy. Otherwise,
he's never gonna-- Come on.

06:04.598 --> 06:08.400
I just feel like this is
a very inappropriate outfit
for how cold it is out here.

06:08.402 --> 06:09.601
Is it cold out here?
It's freezing!

06:09.603 --> 06:12.637
I have a down jacket on, a
wool blanket. It's a very toasty
situation I got back here.

06:12.639 --> 06:18.643
Get back out there, tiger.
You can do it.
I believe in you.

[ Frank ]
Oh, Mac?
[ Knocks ]

06:23.450 --> 06:25.851
Are you in there?

06:26.986 --> 06:29.020
We're clear, Charlie.
Come on.

06:29.022 --> 06:30.756
This is an illegal search,
Frank.

06:30.758 --> 06:33.058
What's the decorating motif
of this place-- prison cell?

06:33.060 --> 06:35.994
I'm pretty sure
you need a warrant
to be doing this, buddy.

06:35.996 --> 06:39.097
What-- Why are you
wearing those gloves?
Fingerprints.

06:39.099 --> 06:42.834
You think I want some Jew
lawyer crawling up my ass
in six months?

06:42.836 --> 06:44.903
Objection.
Extremely racist, man.

06:44.905 --> 06:47.439
The guy's innocent, all right?
You're poking around,

06:47.441 --> 06:49.975
but there's no point to it
'cause you're not gonna
find anything.

Oh!
♪ And Bingo was his name-o ♪

06:54.648 --> 06:56.515
The Human Anatomy.

06:56.517 --> 06:59.518
He's got a half
a chapter highlighted...

06:59.520 --> 07:01.653
on the removal
of human genitalia.

07:01.655 --> 07:06.858
Hey, Frank, what guy hasn't
done some extensive research on
his own genitalia? All right?

07:06.860 --> 07:08.994
Don't say "you," buddy,
because I woke up...

07:08.996 --> 07:11.730
to you doing some
pretty frantic research
last night, pal.

07:11.732 --> 07:15.033
We could go tit for tat
on that one. So you better
drop that subject.

07:15.035 --> 07:19.971
All I'm saying is that the book
doesn't mean anything.
You got no evidence!

07:19.973 --> 07:21.506
You got no case, Frank.

I think you got the wrong idea.
I'm not with anybody.

07:40.761 --> 07:41.660
Word? Well, lookee here.

Maybe if you get up off
that crack rock, you can come
and be Pepper Jack's best ho.

07:48.135 --> 07:49.868
Oh, no. I'm not
on any crack rock.

07:49.870 --> 07:52.871
I mean, one-- Okay,
one time I was hooked
on the crack rock.

07:52.873 --> 07:56.908
But that was because I was
trying to get on welfare
and fail a drug test.

07:56.910 --> 07:59.978
But that stuff,
you gotta be careful
because it'll mess you.

07:59.980 --> 08:02.814
Why are you asking?
Do you have some on you?

conduct some business here too.

just gonna come here and

going about this the wrong way.

I mean, you can't just
jump into the mind
of a serial killer.

I feel like you need
to walk in his shoes.

09:02.376 --> 09:06.645
Right. We need to go deeper.
We need to eat, breathe
and sleep serial killer.

that this guy would in order
to understand his thoughts.

Yeah. Okay,
what's the first step?

09:12.286 --> 09:15.287
Here's what I think.
If I was gonna start
mass murdering people,

09:15.289 --> 09:18.356
I feel like the first thing
I would do is pick a victim.

09:18.358 --> 09:22.661
Right. We need a victim.
We need to find somebody
who we would want to kill.

that much harder.

You gotta quit
this thing, buddy.

and boom, it just happens.
