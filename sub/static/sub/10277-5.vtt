WEBVTT

00:04.861 --> 00:06.432
Previously on E.R.

00:06.433 --> 00:09.865
- Seems like you're settling in well, eh?
- Oh, everybody is been terrific.

00:09.866 --> 00:10.991
- You're a resident?
- Yeah.

00:10.992 --> 00:13.721
Well, one thing you still need to
learn is that every patient in here...

00:13.756 --> 00:17.136
is somebody's boyfriend,
girlfriend, father, mother, son...

00:17.137 --> 00:20.374
It went well. Within the next couple
of weeks we can begin reconstruction.

00:20.575 --> 00:21.660
Meg, are you smoking?

00:21.661 --> 00:23.082
I'm just really stressed.

00:23.083 --> 00:25.463
Lucy, I've been treating
trauma patients for thirty years.

00:25.464 --> 00:26.664
I think I know what I ordered.

00:26.665 --> 00:28.659
- We're gonna let you take Carlos.
- Really?

00:29.958 --> 00:32.087
- Somebody ought to give this guy a talking-to!
- That's not your job.

00:32.088 --> 00:34.435
- The hell it isn't, man.
- Look, you don't know the details.

00:34.436 --> 00:35.436
I know enough!

00:36.313 --> 00:39.231
6x04 "TRUTH AND CONSEQUENCES"

00:47.993 --> 00:50.235
Sorry boss, I didn't realize it was you.

00:50.454 --> 00:53.371
Beluchi, as a New York resident,
you should know enough to wear a helmet.

00:53.540 --> 00:54.768
I got a hard head.

00:54.883 --> 00:57.968
I've been hit three times.
Never got anything worse than road rash.

00:58.278 --> 00:59.872
You always been on County?

01:00.046 --> 01:02.420
- Gosh. Going on ten years.
- Damn!

01:02.533 --> 01:04.542
Killers of entire families
don't get ten years.

01:04.660 --> 01:06.385
It's not a prison, Dave.

01:06.595 --> 01:10.545
I don't know about that. Dr. Weaver sure
acts like a warden. And what's with the leg?

01:10.725 --> 01:12.267
She crash her Harley?

01:12.476 --> 01:15.181
I don't know. I never asked.

01:15.354 --> 01:16.385
Wanna lift?

01:16.605 --> 01:19.689
- On your bike?
- Yeah. Never ride double before?

01:19.900 --> 01:22.901
Not since I was eight
and had a banana seat.

01:23.070 --> 01:25.905
- A what?
- Forget it, before your time. Thanks anyway.

01:26.073 --> 01:29.240
Suit yourself.
See you in the trenches.

01:31.496 --> 01:32.741
Watch out!

01:33.790 --> 01:35.450
You're such a good boy.

01:36.959 --> 01:38.122
Daddy's home.

01:40.338 --> 01:41.452
There you go.

01:42.507 --> 01:46.374
- Hi.
- Sorry I'm late. I got held up.

01:47.178 --> 01:48.506
Better get going.

01:48.971 --> 01:51.926
How's my buddy?
Say good bye to Mommy, Carlos.

01:52.225 --> 01:56.353
"Bye, Mommy. Daddy and I are gonna
watch some ESPN."

01:57.397 --> 01:59.188
- Ok, the med schedule is-
- On the fridge.

01:59.399 --> 02:00.727
Don't forget to wear gloves
when you change him-

02:00.900 --> 02:03.985
Jeanie, don't worry.
We'll be fine.

02:04.195 --> 02:07.647
- Love you.
- Love you too. Have a good day.

02:08.282 --> 02:12.695
- We can't treat this. Try the V.A.
- No, no, no!

02:12.912 --> 02:18.252
I've got to get to work and I can't cross
the kids safely if I can't hold up my sign.

02:18.961 --> 02:23.089
- Why can't you hold it in that hand.
- That's my whistle hand.

02:24.132 --> 02:26.540
There. Problem solved.

02:27.135 --> 02:30.089
Randy, can you help this gentleman, please?

02:32.140 --> 02:34.810
- Is your bike in the lounge again?
- No.

02:35.018 --> 02:38.387
- You know there's a rack in the ambulance bay?
- I know.

02:38.647 --> 02:41.980
Take curtain one.
Severe abdominal pain.

02:42.192 --> 02:44.481
Hi, Jesse. I'm doctor Dave.

02:44.695 --> 02:47.981
- I don't feel too well.
- What's the problem?

02:48.407 --> 02:49.570
That's colorful.

02:50.117 --> 02:52.822
- Lucy, meet Jesse.
- Not my patient.

02:52.995 --> 02:56.115
I gotta get my bike
out of the lounge.

02:56.332 --> 02:58.289
Hey, isn't that your bike?

02:59.168 --> 03:00.626
Hey!

03:03.297 --> 03:05.170
That's gonna leave a mark.

03:07.000 --> 03:13.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:56.225 --> 03:59.143
- So cute.
- How's Reggie like being a father?

03:59.354 --> 04:02.557
- He's loving it.
- Who took Mr. Opotoski's chart?

04:02.899 --> 04:05.817
Every time I turn around,
one of the nurses takes my chart.

04:06.027 --> 04:09.562
- You left this in the suture room.
- I wasn't in the suture room.

04:09.781 --> 04:12.189
- You're welcome.
- Dr. Lawrence.

04:12.409 --> 04:13.867
Dr. Carter.

04:14.077 --> 04:19.118
A grateful patient gave me
two Blackhawks tickets. Interested?

04:19.332 --> 04:21.574
Trauma on ice. Who could say no?

04:21.750 --> 04:25.203
- What do we got here?
- Guy slashed with a knife.

04:25.422 --> 04:27.748
Looks clean and superficial.

04:27.925 --> 04:31.839
Check this out. It's Dermabond.
Pretty nifty stuff.

04:32.429 --> 04:35.715
- Like Super Glue.
- Army had that in the '60s.

04:35.933 --> 04:37.972
- Come on.
- Yeah, really.

04:38.185 --> 04:41.933
FDA took 30 years
to approve it for civilians.

04:42.147 --> 04:43.606
Update his tetanus.

04:43.774 --> 04:46.229
Did you see a dog bite victim?

04:46.443 --> 04:50.026
- Is there a problem?
- This chart is illegible.

04:50.238 --> 04:53.655
It should be.
Didn't you learn that in Med School?

04:53.868 --> 04:56.869
- You were a student?
- All right. Look.

04:57.079 --> 05:01.990
- Admit it. You can't even read that.
- That's for security purposes.

05:02.209 --> 05:06.622
- Why not use a computer?
- A computer crashes. My notes don't.

05:06.839 --> 05:09.460
- I'll help with the computer.
- Great idea.

05:09.633 --> 05:14.972
- Can't teach an old dog new tricks.
- You're not old. Just stubborn.

05:17.058 --> 05:19.810
- Hi.
- Hello.

05:20.019 --> 05:22.226
- Elaine.
- John.

05:22.438 --> 05:26.483
- Dr. Lawrence, meet Elaine Nichols.
- Nice to meet you.

05:26.692 --> 05:30.476
- Do you have a minute, John?
- Would you excuse us?

05:31.948 --> 05:35.032
- Hey, Dr. Lawrence.
- Dr. David.

05:35.242 --> 05:36.986
You know Weaver, right?

05:37.161 --> 05:40.909
- She ever tell you about her leg?
- No. Why?

05:41.123 --> 05:42.535
Just curious.

05:44.377 --> 05:47.829
Don't look at me.
Ask Carter. He lived with her.

05:48.048 --> 05:49.921
Really?

05:50.342 --> 05:53.627
I'm doing everything by the book.
I even gave up caffeine.

05:53.845 --> 05:57.545
- Are you getting plenty of rest?
- I'm trying.

05:57.807 --> 06:01.342
I'm really sorry about
the cafeteria thing, but...

06:01.561 --> 06:05.511
I got a new job
at the Big-T Pharmacy.

06:05.690 --> 06:09.439
I gave them your name as a reference,
if that's okay.

06:09.653 --> 06:11.942
Sure.

06:12.155 --> 06:16.283
I've told them I've known you
a couple of years. In case they call.

06:16.493 --> 06:19.114
But I doubt they will.

06:20.455 --> 06:22.697
Something wrong with my eyes?

06:25.710 --> 06:28.380
Are you taking any medications?

06:28.546 --> 06:32.165
- Just prenatal vitamins.
- Good.

06:33.677 --> 06:36.003
Okay, I'll be back.

06:41.685 --> 06:44.852
Why don't you take a break?
I'll cover.

06:45.064 --> 06:49.725
- Can you have this tox screened?
- Sure thing.

06:52.279 --> 06:53.358
Taking a breather?

06:53.572 --> 06:55.446
My breathing's fine, but...

06:55.657 --> 06:57.947
my ankles are about to explode.

06:58.161 --> 07:02.075
- Maybe I'll wrap them in duct tape.
- Don't think that's recommended.

07:02.874 --> 07:07.085
- Is this our MVA?
- Yeah, Benjamin Hearn, 16, with CF.

07:07.253 --> 07:11.001
- Car accident, trauma to right side.
- How you feeling?

07:11.215 --> 07:16.091
- Hurts to breathe.
- Tachy at 130, BP's 110 over 72.

07:17.638 --> 07:20.425
Did you take his temperature?

07:20.599 --> 07:22.592
Okay. Call me if you need me.

07:22.810 --> 07:27.638
Okay, there's no sign of a fracture.
Did his blood work come back?

07:28.400 --> 07:29.775
- Jeanie?
- Yeah?

07:30.110 --> 07:32.186
- Blood work?
- It isn't back yet.

07:32.403 --> 07:35.440
Is everything okay?
You seem distracted.

07:35.615 --> 07:38.699
Sorry.
Carlos was a bit off this morning.

07:38.910 --> 07:40.902
Reggie's is still getting used
to the dad rutine.

07:41.120 --> 07:45.034
- Why don't you call him?
- I did. Everything's fine.

07:45.249 --> 07:47.158
I just hate being away from him.

07:47.376 --> 07:48.753
What do we got?

07:48.962 --> 07:51.632
Rib fractures, possible liver laceration.

07:51.840 --> 07:54.592
When were you last hospitalized
for cystic fybrosis?

07:54.801 --> 07:56.177
About a year ago.

07:56.386 --> 07:57.928
Guarding right quadrant.

07:58.138 --> 08:01.341
Let's get a CBC type
and cross a four chest and a C-spine.

08:01.558 --> 08:04.724
Let's get ultrasound.

08:04.936 --> 08:08.934
And let's get genetics down here
for a pre-op consult.

08:09.607 --> 08:12.394
- Carol?
- I think I'm having a contraction.

08:12.610 --> 08:15.185
- Why don't you step out.
- No.

08:16.115 --> 08:18.653
It's gone. I'm fine,
it must have been a Braxton Hicks.

08:18.867 --> 08:22.616
Carol, I want you to go sit down and if you
have another one you're going on the monitor.

08:22.830 --> 08:25.155
Soft, mild tenderness.

08:25.374 --> 08:26.405
No rebound.

08:26.625 --> 08:31.964
Let's get a tox screen CBC chem 7,
liver panel and a lead test.

08:32.255 --> 08:33.335
Coming up.

08:33.506 --> 08:34.835
So, Jesse...

08:35.424 --> 08:37.299
how much paint did you eat?

08:37.510 --> 08:40.381
I don't know. Half a tube, maybe.

08:40.765 --> 08:42.342
Do you do this very often?

08:43.083 --> 08:46.553
Just this once.
I had pretty a bad day.

08:46.654 --> 08:48.514
You depressed?

08:48.689 --> 08:50.563
Creatively challenged.

08:50.775 --> 08:53.692
- So you're an artist?
- No.

08:54.195 --> 08:58.026
Francis Bacon, William Blake.
Those guys were artists.

08:59.783 --> 09:04.460
- I'm actually feeling pretty good now-
- No. We need to run some tests...

09:04.522 --> 09:06.866
and I want to check the toxicity
of the paint you ingested.

09:07.208 --> 09:09.364
You must think I'm pretty stupid.

09:09.695 --> 09:12.373
No. Creatively challenged.

09:13.923 --> 09:16.924
Dr. Julian, Genetics.
This your CF patient?

09:17.135 --> 09:21.381
He needs a laparotomy. I'd like you
to sign off on anesthesia.

09:21.556 --> 09:23.928
- What are his sats?
- 97 percent.

09:24.141 --> 09:26.015
- His x-ray?
- No fluids.

09:26.227 --> 09:28.100
Give me five minutes.

09:28.312 --> 09:29.890
Set up for spirometry.

09:30.106 --> 09:31.898
- His father's here.
- Okay.

09:32.109 --> 09:34.564
- Peter, you got this?
- Yeah, go.

09:36.363 --> 09:38.770
Hey. Any more contractions?

09:38.990 --> 09:41.232
You should go home
and get off your feet for a while.

09:41.451 --> 09:42.731
I'm fine, Mark.

09:42.911 --> 09:45.746
As long as these guys would stop
using my bladder as a socker ball.

09:45.955 --> 09:49.371
You should try to
slow things down a little.

09:49.484 --> 09:52.751
- I don't need you worrying about me.
- Somebody's got to worry about you.

09:52.920 --> 09:54.498
I've gotta pee.

09:56.508 --> 09:59.509
Ultrasound showed a tear in Benjamin's liver.

09:59.720 --> 10:00.723
Is he gonna be okay?

10:00.874 --> 10:04.512
He has an excelent chance of survival, but
he's gonna need surgery to repair the damage.

10:04.725 --> 10:06.267
Should we donate blood?

10:06.476 --> 10:09.643
No, we'll have to operate immediately.
We'll see if we can use his own blood.

10:09.855 --> 10:13.983
If he does require a transfusion, I can
assure you our supply has been screened.

10:14.192 --> 10:18.024
No, I don't want Benjamin
getting blood from some stranger.

10:18.038 --> 10:20.120
Would you screen Mr. Hearn and his son?

10:20.155 --> 10:22.139
They want to de designated
donors to Benjamin Hearn.

10:22.159 --> 10:24.068
Sure. You want to follow me?

10:25.913 --> 10:27.704
Sorry I didn't return your calls.

10:28.040 --> 10:30.827
And I apologize for standing you up.

10:31.043 --> 10:33.082
That's okay.

10:33.379 --> 10:37.507
I guess I just needed time to...

10:37.716 --> 10:40.041
sort things out.

10:41.136 --> 10:42.299
And have you?

10:45.557 --> 10:46.636
I think so.

10:51.230 --> 10:55.477
You don't have to worry about me
anymore, John. I'll be okay.

10:56.652 --> 10:58.941
And your follow-up?

10:59.530 --> 11:02.484
I'm seeing a plastic surgeon
on Wednesday.

11:02.658 --> 11:04.366
And after that...

11:06.036 --> 11:07.946
I'm thinking about going to Europe.

11:08.789 --> 11:10.034
For how long?

11:10.249 --> 11:13.701
I don't know. Couple months.

11:13.920 --> 11:16.493
Just do a little soul searching.

11:18.299 --> 11:21.004
So this is goodbye?

11:22.145 --> 11:24.123
This is thank you.

11:25.081 --> 11:26.775
For everything.

11:38.387 --> 11:40.479
Will you give me a call when you get back?

11:43.292 --> 11:45.498
I'll send you a postcard.

11:54.336 --> 11:56.079
Hey, Carter.

11:56.296 --> 11:59.001
- You lived with Weaver?
- In her basement.

11:59.215 --> 12:00.378
In her basement?

12:00.550 --> 12:03.920
- She was my landlady.
- Okay. Sure.

12:04.138 --> 12:07.092
So when your landlady was
collecting rent...

12:07.308 --> 12:09.347
you must have seen her leg, right?

12:09.560 --> 12:10.888
Go away, Dave.

12:11.103 --> 12:13.855
- Come on. Hey, Lucy.
- Don't talk to me.

12:14.064 --> 12:15.523
Why's everyone so grumpy?

12:15.732 --> 12:18.402
Unit contacting County General.

12:18.610 --> 12:23.355
Rescue 43 at multi-victim incident.
How many can you take?

12:23.573 --> 12:26.907
- Two and eight.
- Two major, eight minor.

12:27.577 --> 12:29.487
Prep Trauma 1 and 2.

12:29.705 --> 12:35.044
Kidney failure, liver damage,
your red blood cells could explode.

12:35.628 --> 12:38.333
Okay, you made your point.

12:38.547 --> 12:41.501
I won't eat any more paint.

12:41.717 --> 12:43.211
What about the cocaine?

12:44.261 --> 12:46.301
Your urine tested positive.

12:47.389 --> 12:49.465
Okay, so on occasion I...

12:49.683 --> 12:53.895
...I have used some
mind-expanding chemicals.

12:54.146 --> 12:55.641
I'm not the first artist to do so.

12:55.899 --> 12:58.899
But you've been using
the last few days.

12:59.611 --> 13:03.655
- I want to put you in rehab.
- Thanks, but I'm cool.

13:03.823 --> 13:06.314
I've been under lots of stress,
my work sucks.

13:06.534 --> 13:09.570
Maybe it's because
you're using cocaine.

13:10.037 --> 13:13.821
You came here for help,
so let me help you.

13:16.127 --> 13:19.578
- Can you paint in these programs?
- Probably.

13:20.340 --> 13:23.791
- What do you think?
- I can't promise anything.

13:24.469 --> 13:26.592
- I'll check it out.
- Great.

13:26.805 --> 13:30.802
Explosion in a science class.
We took two major, eight minor.

13:30.975 --> 13:32.007
Feeling generous?

13:32.227 --> 13:34.295
Victor Sutherland, 52-year-old teacher.

13:34.432 --> 13:38.763
Respiratory distress,
BP 90 over 60. Pulse 1-20.

13:38.983 --> 13:41.308
- What?
- Hazmat said it was chlorine gas.

13:41.486 --> 13:43.562
- Don't speak.
- Lungs are wet.

13:43.821 --> 13:45.150
- Tube him.
- Any others?

13:45.323 --> 13:46.403
He's the worst.

13:46.617 --> 13:49.986
Triage the others
and watch the residents.

13:50.662 --> 13:53.153
- What's this?
- Ken Kranics, 17.

13:53.415 --> 13:58.754
Blunt head trauma with LOC.
Respiratory rate of four. BP 124/86.

13:59.046 --> 14:01.453
Get a head CT, call neurosurgery.

14:01.715 --> 14:03.257
Call me if you need me.

14:05.802 --> 14:08.589
- What's going on?
- Science room explosion.

14:08.847 --> 14:10.756
There's a dozen more.

14:10.974 --> 14:14.225
Looks like partial thickness burns.

14:14.437 --> 14:15.635
She's wheezy.

14:15.855 --> 14:18.642
16-year-old with penetrating
abdominal injury.

14:18.858 --> 14:21.609
BP 95/65. Pulse 110.
We gave her a liter.

14:21.819 --> 14:23.277
- Pull it out.
- We will.

14:23.487 --> 14:28.826
Hang in there. We need an ultrasound
before we go to O.R. Trauma 1.

14:29.368 --> 14:34.706
- We've got a Colles' fracture here.
- That's a grade-one open fracture.

14:34.873 --> 14:39.038
- Do I set it for reduction?
- Only if there's dorsal angulation.

14:39.253 --> 14:42.836
- You want something for the pain?
- No, I'm okay.

14:43.049 --> 14:45.800
- Stop it!
- You have to let me irrigate.

14:46.010 --> 14:49.545
- How we doing here?
- Glass injuries to eyes.

14:49.764 --> 14:54.057
Should I give this guy mannitol?
I see papilledema-

14:54.268 --> 14:56.724
- What do you mean?
- Head trauma.

14:56.896 --> 15:01.392
He hasn't blown a pupil. GCS is
nine and disc margins are blurred.

15:01.609 --> 15:03.317
- Has he blown a pupil?
- No...

15:03.528 --> 15:05.319
...they're equal and reactive.

15:05.572 --> 15:08.063
Hold off. Wait for the head CT.

15:08.283 --> 15:09.741
- You were saying?
- What?

15:09.909 --> 15:14.867
- Thin cuts?
- Through the orbits. Optho consult.

15:15.081 --> 15:18.995
- I can't see anything.
- You're in good hands, son.

15:21.379 --> 15:24.997
Janet Gunderson, 17, chest hit the
edge of a desk.

15:25.216 --> 15:30.342
- Pleuritic pain. Pulse 100, BP 132/74.
- What's open?

15:30.555 --> 15:34.256
- Try Curtain 3.
- Chest x-ray and an EKG.

15:34.476 --> 15:36.515
We got a finger amputation.

15:36.728 --> 15:39.682
- Is the finger on ice?
- His friend lost it.

15:39.898 --> 15:44.358
Give him a gram of Ancef
and call the reimplantation service.

15:44.569 --> 15:47.190
Ten of lidocaine.
I'll do a wrist block.

15:47.405 --> 15:49.694
- We could use you.
- For who?

15:49.908 --> 15:53.408
The girls with the
hand and facial burns.

15:53.621 --> 15:56.158
- What is that?
- Antibiotic ointment.

15:56.373 --> 16:00.205
- Did you call the burn team?
- Yes, 8% body area.

16:00.419 --> 16:03.669
Is Vancomycin okay for my patient?

16:03.881 --> 16:05.790
- Which one?
- Hand injury.

16:05.966 --> 16:07.923
- The finger?
- No, the wrist.

16:08.135 --> 16:10.542
You said Ancef, but he's allergic.

16:10.762 --> 16:14.463
- Fine. What room is he in?
- Exam 4.

16:15.016 --> 16:16.926
Should I give steroids?

16:17.144 --> 16:19.814
- Steriods?
- Yeah. For the wheezing.

16:20.022 --> 16:21.185
I wouldn't.

16:21.399 --> 16:23.854
Why not?

16:24.068 --> 16:27.484
It's not good. Don't do it. Trust me.

16:32.451 --> 16:34.360
How you doing?

16:34.578 --> 16:36.120
All I did was puke.

16:38.165 --> 16:43.242
- You weren't in the explosion?
- Is that what happened? Sounds crazy.

17:05.526 --> 17:09.820
Haleh, you got the drug key?
Ten of morphine.

17:11.366 --> 17:12.694
Thanks.

17:19.040 --> 17:23.038
Coming through!
Coming through!

17:25.964 --> 17:27.291
We need you, doctor.

17:28.215 --> 17:29.758
I'm in. Bag him.

17:29.968 --> 17:32.719
- What's up?
- I could use a hand.

17:32.887 --> 17:34.714
His lungs are full of fluid.

17:35.223 --> 17:37.975
Pulmonary edema from the chlorine.

17:38.185 --> 17:41.601
Still hypotensive after decompression.

17:41.813 --> 17:44.767
- 32 French right here.
- Check the belly.

17:46.068 --> 17:49.982
- Can we get ultrasound?
- It's tied up. I'll do a DPL.

17:50.197 --> 17:52.901
Dr. Lawrence, my EKG?

17:53.074 --> 17:57.072
My patient has a chest fracture.
I'm afraid of tamponade.

17:57.245 --> 17:59.072
- Do a cardiac echo.
- But-

17:59.247 --> 18:01.241
Just do the damn echo!

18:04.628 --> 18:06.751
- What's this?
- Peritoneal lavage kit.

18:06.922 --> 18:11.549
It's a percutaneous kit.
Use the Seldinger technique.

18:13.262 --> 18:16.678
- I'll do an open lavage.
- The kit works well.

18:16.890 --> 18:18.764
Where's the drug box?

18:18.976 --> 18:20.518
Just get me a scalpel...

18:20.894 --> 18:23.468
...some towel clips,
a pair of rakes...

18:23.689 --> 18:25.099
...and a...

18:28.361 --> 18:31.527
- A hemostat?
- Yeah. Come on. Hurry up.

18:35.409 --> 18:38.114
It's fairly easy to use, Gabe.

18:38.287 --> 18:41.122
You just spread the guide-wire-

18:41.332 --> 18:42.612
These are unreliable.

18:42.833 --> 18:44.956
You hit the preperitoneal space.

18:45.169 --> 18:48.289
- I think if you tried-
- I said no, damn it!

18:49.590 --> 18:52.296
I do an open technique.
It's standard.

18:52.469 --> 18:56.597
And that's what I'm gonna do.
This is crap!

19:07.483 --> 19:11.647
The finger amputation
is ready for his wrist block.

19:12.196 --> 19:13.311
Right.

19:16.242 --> 19:19.030
You seem to have everything
under control, Kerry.

19:19.788 --> 19:21.827
Another patient needs me.

19:35.512 --> 19:39.426
I'm sorry. That was unprofessional
and uncalled for.

19:39.641 --> 19:44.220
- Do you want to talk about it?
- There's nothing to talk about.

19:45.105 --> 19:49.020
It's been awhile since I've had
multiple casualties.

19:49.234 --> 19:52.069
You should have asked for help.

19:52.279 --> 19:53.524
You had your hands full.

19:53.947 --> 19:58.656
I was overloaded, that's all.
It happens to the best of us.

19:59.536 --> 20:02.074
Do you remember that time...

20:02.289 --> 20:04.780
...you were third year, I think.

20:05.000 --> 20:09.746
A double-decker bus hit a bridge
and sheared off the top.

20:09.964 --> 20:13.380
- That was insane.
- It was a little hectic.

20:13.592 --> 20:15.217
A little hectic?

20:15.386 --> 20:17.628
Three gurneys in every space.

20:17.847 --> 20:21.796
Everybody lost it.
But you kept your cool.

20:26.981 --> 20:30.432
I don't know if I should
be telling you this...

20:31.068 --> 20:32.230
What is it, Gabe?

20:35.573 --> 20:38.444
There were times
when you drove me nuts.

20:38.660 --> 20:41.329
It was like
having ten other students.

20:41.537 --> 20:46.958
You asked more questions
than I thought was humanly possible.

20:47.168 --> 20:50.453
But it payed off.
I'm proud of you, Kerry.

20:50.671 --> 20:53.245
Chief of Emergency Medicine.

20:53.466 --> 20:55.458
You were great in there.

20:55.676 --> 21:00.837
- Damn, I was a good teacher.
- And still are, according to Carter.

21:01.892 --> 21:05.723
I think you're wrong about these kits,
but I'll use them.

21:05.937 --> 21:07.764
It's your ER now.

21:09.149 --> 21:10.773
For the record...

21:10.984 --> 21:14.851
...my way may be older,
but it's faster and better.

21:15.071 --> 21:16.482
Kind of like me.

21:28.127 --> 21:30.962
Are you taking any pain medication?

21:31.171 --> 21:35.714
- No. Why?
- You tested positive for opiates.

21:37.260 --> 21:40.594
- What?
- You're taking drugs, which means...

21:40.806 --> 21:45.633
- ...your baby is taking drugs.
- I'm not using drugs.

21:46.228 --> 21:51.305
If you're sharing needles,
you're putting the baby at risk for-

21:51.817 --> 21:55.269
- I'm not sharing needles.
- But you are using.

22:00.409 --> 22:06.163
- I know you care about your baby.
- I do. I do care.

22:06.331 --> 22:08.324
Do you want to hurt it?

22:12.004 --> 22:16.002
- Then you have to stop.
- I'm hardly using...

22:16.384 --> 22:20.595
- ...just so I don't get sick.
- You can't use at all!

22:23.224 --> 22:26.557
Let me put you into a detox program.

22:33.359 --> 22:35.233
I'll see what I can do.

22:41.075 --> 22:43.911
You're putting him on a psych hold?

22:44.120 --> 22:47.406
It's voluntary. I'll call down
when a bed opens.

22:52.170 --> 22:56.214
- Did I pass?
- Yep. You'll go up within the hour.

22:57.216 --> 22:59.505
They won't let me paint.

22:59.719 --> 23:00.964
I'm sorry.

23:01.179 --> 23:02.922
They said I could sketch.

23:04.015 --> 23:05.343
Thanks...

23:05.558 --> 23:08.560
...for helping me. I really needed it.

23:13.150 --> 23:14.893
- Dr. Meyers.
- Carol.

23:16.111 --> 23:19.776
I have an expectant mother
in need of a rehab bed.

23:19.948 --> 23:23.032
I just gave our last bed
to a guy in Exam 1.

23:23.243 --> 23:25.401
- She's pregnant.
- I'm sorry.

23:25.620 --> 23:28.491
A space might open up soon, though.

23:28.706 --> 23:31.910
Can he sign up for an
outpatient program?

23:32.126 --> 23:34.500
This is about an unborn child.

23:34.713 --> 23:37.963
- Let's see what we got. Where is she?
- In here.

23:41.428 --> 23:44.429
- How's it going?
- Have you spoken to Ben?

23:44.640 --> 23:47.510
No. Is he doing okay?

23:47.726 --> 23:50.597
You know what? Let's talk in here.

23:55.275 --> 23:59.143
- Is something wrong with Ben?
- No, he'll be fine.

23:59.322 --> 24:03.651
It's just that when I screened
your blood, you tested...

24:03.868 --> 24:05.825
HIV positive.

24:07.455 --> 24:09.328
You should have told me.

24:11.167 --> 24:15.413
I didn't know for sure. Until now.

24:20.300 --> 24:21.415
I'm sorry.

24:21.635 --> 24:23.794
I figured this would happen.

24:24.013 --> 24:26.220
You didn't practice safe sex?

24:26.432 --> 24:28.140
Apparently not.

24:28.351 --> 24:33.309
I could send you to a clinic.
You could start treatment.

24:33.523 --> 24:36.808
- Are you going to tell my parents?
- No.

24:37.026 --> 24:38.520
Listen.

24:38.736 --> 24:42.070
Family support is important
in dealing with HIV.

24:42.281 --> 24:46.030
Support? Are you kidding?
My old man would disown me.

24:46.702 --> 24:49.075
I tried telling them. The whole:

24:49.247 --> 24:54.040
"I've got this friend who's gay."
He freaked. He said...

24:54.252 --> 24:59.163
...if I brought a fag to his house
he would kick my ass.

24:59.382 --> 25:03.166
It would be easier
if your family knew the truth.

25:03.386 --> 25:04.715
No.

25:05.889 --> 25:07.881
Forget it.

25:08.099 --> 25:11.717
Every family has its secrets anyway.
Right?

25:15.941 --> 25:20.021
- Can you see a possible CVA?
- Not now. Ask Carter.

25:20.237 --> 25:22.064
- You took my spot.
- What?

25:22.281 --> 25:25.614
- In detox.
- Meyers made him an outpatient.

25:25.826 --> 25:31.068
- After you convinced him.
- We needed the spot for a pregnant-

25:31.289 --> 25:33.661
- But you're a nurse-
- What?

25:33.875 --> 25:36.331
You're a med student!

25:36.544 --> 25:41.788
- I'm sure he'll be admitted soon.
- That's easy for you to say.

25:44.428 --> 25:46.255
Did you find Lawrence?

25:46.472 --> 25:48.797
- Yep.
- And?

25:49.016 --> 25:50.475
And what?

25:51.810 --> 25:53.602
He had a meltdown.

25:53.812 --> 25:56.932
- That's a little melodramatic.
- I don't know.

25:57.149 --> 26:01.692
He's not the first to lose his temper
in the heat of the moment.

26:01.904 --> 26:04.655
- Over a lavage kit?
- You know what?

26:04.823 --> 26:07.280
He's been doing this for 30 years.

26:07.493 --> 26:09.901
He doesn't like the newer equipment.

26:10.121 --> 26:14.450
- I know you two are close.
- What are you trying to say?

26:14.667 --> 26:18.961
- He's acting a bit strange.
- Yeah, he's eccentric.

26:19.171 --> 26:21.164
But he's a great doctor.

26:21.841 --> 26:24.248
- Don't be defensive.
- I'm not.

26:24.468 --> 26:28.133
You don't like that I hired Gabe.
I did, so deal with it.

26:30.850 --> 26:33.176
I repaired Ben's liver.
He's fine.

26:33.353 --> 26:37.433
- Any complications?
- We gave him some blood, but...

26:37.649 --> 26:39.855
...I expect a full recovery.

26:40.026 --> 26:42.019
He got our blood, right?

26:42.195 --> 26:44.900
Just yours. I couldn't use Aaron's.

26:46.407 --> 26:49.527
- Why not?
- It wasn't a good match.

26:49.702 --> 26:51.576
But we have the same type.

26:52.663 --> 26:57.955
But Aaron's had different antigens
that could have caused a reaction.

26:59.338 --> 27:02.837
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay. The important thing is...

27:03.091 --> 27:06.875
- ... Ben's gonna be all right.
- Yeah.

27:09.222 --> 27:10.764
Thanks.

27:12.225 --> 27:13.304
Thanks.

27:16.438 --> 27:18.644
Everyone's been here for hours.

27:18.857 --> 27:20.730
Where were you hiding?

27:21.359 --> 27:23.020
I wasn't hiding.

27:24.321 --> 27:26.895
I just didn't think it was so bad.

27:27.116 --> 27:30.152
How's my teacher, Mr. Sutherland?

27:30.369 --> 27:32.326
I haven't heard.

27:32.538 --> 27:34.779
What experiment were you doing?

27:36.291 --> 27:38.118
The wrong one.

27:39.127 --> 27:40.503
What does that mean?

27:41.254 --> 27:42.499
Nothing.

27:45.258 --> 27:47.382
What happened today, Howie?

27:49.639 --> 27:54.135
If you have any information,
you should let me know.

27:54.894 --> 27:57.349
It might help us treat
Mr. Sutherland.

27:59.565 --> 28:02.601
Do you promise to keep this secret?

28:02.818 --> 28:06.152
Doctor/patient confidentiality
and all that?

28:07.489 --> 28:11.736
I can promise you'll feel better
if you tell me the truth.

28:12.077 --> 28:14.118
The right eye will be fine.

28:14.330 --> 28:19.372
But glass sliced through the
left eyeball and displaced the lens.

28:20.753 --> 28:24.833
- When can they fix that?
- It will be a difficult job.

28:25.007 --> 28:27.759
- Can I see?
- I don't think that-

28:28.219 --> 28:29.464
Jeez-!

28:30.263 --> 28:32.884
Dad? What is it? What's wrong?

28:33.099 --> 28:36.432
We just have to wait
for the specialist.

28:36.644 --> 28:39.266
- Is it okay?
- Mr. Perez, will you come with me?

28:39.481 --> 28:42.054
- Where's he going?
- He needs to...

28:42.275 --> 28:45.360
- They can't fix that.
- I'm not a specialist.

28:45.528 --> 28:48.446
- The optho-
- He's gonna be blind.

28:48.656 --> 28:51.693
- We don't know that-
- He has a scholarship.

28:51.910 --> 28:54.911
- I understand.
- The first to go to college.

28:55.079 --> 28:59.788
- He's worked very hard-
- Mr. Perez, please.

29:00.752 --> 29:04.086
It's important
that you're here for your son.

29:04.298 --> 29:05.709
He needs you.

29:20.605 --> 29:23.772
- Everything okay?
- Everything's fine.

29:23.984 --> 29:26.107
It's Reggie. Says it's urgent.

29:28.613 --> 29:29.943
Reggie?

29:30.783 --> 29:32.407
For how long?

29:34.495 --> 29:36.072
Okay, I will. Bye.

29:36.288 --> 29:40.238
- Is everything okay?
- Carlos is sick. I need to go.

29:40.459 --> 29:42.701
- You do. Go on.
- Thanks.

29:42.920 --> 29:46.419
- Did they bring in Howie MacMurtry?
- Why?

29:46.632 --> 29:48.790
Tell her.

29:48.967 --> 29:50.924
He caused the explosion.

29:51.220 --> 29:53.461
The jocks talked me into it.

29:54.766 --> 29:56.889
I switched the chemicals.

29:57.643 --> 30:01.475
It was supposed to be
a small, exothermic reaction.

30:01.647 --> 30:05.063
A little smoke
and a few bubbles, that's all.

30:05.359 --> 30:09.571
But Mr. Sutherland
changed the experiment.

30:09.780 --> 30:12.734
This wasn't supposed to happen.

30:12.950 --> 30:15.951
- It was just a joke.
- You son of a bitch!

30:16.162 --> 30:18.831
- Sir?
- My son is blind because of you.

30:18.998 --> 30:21.834
Nathan and his friends
told me to do it.

30:22.002 --> 30:24.789
- You'll have to leave.
- You're a liar!

30:25.004 --> 30:27.163
- Get out of the way.
- Security!

30:27.340 --> 30:28.834
It was an accident!

30:34.347 --> 30:37.052
- Get off of him! Get up!
- Get away!

30:41.354 --> 30:43.014
- You okay?
- Yeah.

30:46.026 --> 30:48.647
- He's not breathing.
- Do we intubate?

30:48.862 --> 30:50.819
Let's get him to the bed.

30:54.075 --> 30:55.653
Go, go, go, go, go!

30:56.244 --> 31:00.990
Get me a number 8 ET tube.
I need suction.

31:01.207 --> 31:04.659
- Thanks for pulling him off.
- Just get the tube in.

31:04.878 --> 31:06.253
Is he okay?

31:06.463 --> 31:08.539
Let's get him on a pulse ox.

31:10.592 --> 31:13.297
All right. I'm in. Let's bag him.

31:16.932 --> 31:18.925
- No breath sounds.
- Not pinking up.

31:19.143 --> 31:21.598
Intubation was good, I saw the cords.

31:22.813 --> 31:26.063
- He's blowing up.
- Subcutaneous emphysema.

31:26.233 --> 31:27.775
You broke his larynx?

31:28.068 --> 31:32.730
- Let's prep him for a crike.
- It could be below the cricoid.

31:32.906 --> 31:35.444
- Let's trach him.
- What about the tube?

31:35.659 --> 31:38.411
- Pull it out.
- Pulse ox at 81.

31:38.579 --> 31:40.702
Heart rate's down to 50.

31:40.915 --> 31:45.790
Amp of atropine.
Carter, blow some oxygen down there.

31:48.672 --> 31:52.337
- I'm not seeing his chest rise.
- Pulse ox 76.

31:53.093 --> 31:56.758
- Run of five.
- Get a crash cart.

32:01.226 --> 32:02.805
I'm in. Bag him.

32:09.360 --> 32:11.234
I'm getting breath sounds.

32:12.488 --> 32:15.940
- Pulse ox up to 85.
- That was a nice save.

32:17.326 --> 32:18.904
Yeah.

32:22.999 --> 32:25.703
I spoke to the plastic surgeon...

32:25.918 --> 32:29.620
...and he said your burns shouldn't
scar too badly.

32:32.175 --> 32:33.919
Right. Well, um...

32:34.135 --> 32:38.465
...I'll check in later.
If you need anything, hit the buzzer.

32:38.640 --> 32:40.798
I'm gonna have scars.

32:41.935 --> 32:46.478
The new skin may have irregular
pigmentation.

32:46.773 --> 32:48.682
But it's only temporary.

32:48.900 --> 32:50.691
How temporary?

32:51.819 --> 32:53.647
Six months to a year.

32:53.906 --> 32:56.397
The plastic surgeon will know more.

32:56.617 --> 32:59.487
I might look like this for a year?

33:00.120 --> 33:02.160
No, no. Um...

33:02.331 --> 33:06.827
...it will take up to a year,
but you may heal...

33:07.002 --> 33:09.208
...much faster. Okay?

33:09.504 --> 33:11.046
How much faster?

33:12.507 --> 33:14.998
I don't know.

33:15.176 --> 33:17.502
It'll get a little better each day.

33:21.767 --> 33:25.812
- You were lucky, Quinn.
- You think this is lucky?

33:26.230 --> 33:30.014
I look like a hideous freak.

33:30.234 --> 33:34.445
No. No. You look like...

33:34.655 --> 33:39.732
...like a girl who was lucky enough
to survive a dangerous accident.

33:41.411 --> 33:44.995
I'd rather be dead
than look like this.

33:59.388 --> 34:02.342
- You okay?
- Peachy.

34:02.641 --> 34:05.215
You did the right thing.

34:05.436 --> 34:08.601
I think Mr. Perez
might feel differently.

34:08.813 --> 34:09.893
I saw it.

34:10.108 --> 34:12.728
Mark. We need to talk.

34:20.869 --> 34:22.576
Howie, you all right?

34:24.163 --> 34:25.360
Yeah.

34:26.165 --> 34:29.451
- How's Mr. Perez?
- He's gonna be okay.

34:30.585 --> 34:32.745
But not Mr. Sutherland, huh?

34:33.630 --> 34:35.090
I don't know.

34:37.511 --> 34:40.049
A lot of kids thought he was a geek.

34:41.139 --> 34:46.429
He'd mess up the experiments
sometimes, but he did it on purpose...

34:47.020 --> 34:49.592
...just to make class
a little more fun.

34:50.815 --> 34:52.938
He was a really good teacher.

34:57.197 --> 35:01.361
He might recover, right?
Like a long shot or something?

35:02.620 --> 35:04.363
Like one in a million?

35:07.374 --> 35:08.785
Yeah.

35:12.629 --> 35:14.088
I told him.

35:15.132 --> 35:18.086
I told my father I was HIV positive.

35:20.470 --> 35:21.964
Good for you.

35:22.305 --> 35:24.132
He kicked me out.

35:25.475 --> 35:28.477
You know, he might just
need a little time.

35:30.940 --> 35:33.478
He said I'm not his son.

35:36.904 --> 35:38.482
I'm sorry.

35:40.157 --> 35:44.486
At least he knows the truth.
Screw him if he can't handle it.

35:45.329 --> 35:49.492
It might be a few days before
I can get you into detox.

35:49.708 --> 35:53.789
- Should have made reservations.
- You can be an outpatient.

35:54.005 --> 35:55.499
- Whatever.
- You need help.

35:55.673 --> 35:57.880
I need a real job.

35:58.092 --> 36:00.251
I watched you here today.

36:00.470 --> 36:03.589
You, the doctors,
the cops, paramedics.

36:03.806 --> 36:06.677
Everybody's doing
something important...

36:06.893 --> 36:08.173
...and I eat paint.

36:08.394 --> 36:13.186
- You need to talk to someone.
- I don't need a shrink.

36:13.774 --> 36:15.316
See you around.

36:15.526 --> 36:19.690
- Can you speak to one of my patients?
- Go away, Dave.

36:19.906 --> 36:22.278
You fixed that last guy good.

36:22.492 --> 36:23.523
Real good.

36:23.702 --> 36:25.445
This one's different.

36:25.662 --> 36:28.532
I got a teenage girl who
burned her face.

36:28.707 --> 36:30.865
She's really depressed...

36:31.042 --> 36:34.743
- ... and nothing I say is helping.
- Really?

36:34.963 --> 36:39.375
About the hockey game,
I'm afraid I'm gonna have to cancel.

36:39.550 --> 36:43.383
- Everything all right?
- Yeah. Something came up.

36:43.597 --> 36:45.886
So I can see.

36:46.099 --> 36:50.263
- What?
- Moods swings, haggard brow.

36:50.479 --> 36:54.559
Inability to concentrate.
All signs of woman problems.

36:54.775 --> 36:58.393
- It's that obvious?
- If you've been married enough.

36:58.612 --> 37:02.194
And I met her today.
I don't forget a pretty face.

37:02.407 --> 37:06.570
- You got any professional advice?
- What? From me?

37:06.745 --> 37:10.660
I'll diagnose any disease
but I can't figure out women.

37:10.875 --> 37:13.959
That's what makes them
so irresistible.

37:14.170 --> 37:18.997
But I do know life's too short
to waste on regret.

37:20.718 --> 37:22.212
I'll see you tomorrow.

37:22.428 --> 37:23.922
- Dr. Lawrence.
- Yeah.

37:24.138 --> 37:28.431
- I got your films.
- Anyone seen the pregnant woman in 3?

37:28.600 --> 37:31.056
- No, sorry.
- I think she left.

37:31.270 --> 37:33.476
She was supposed to go to detox.

37:33.940 --> 37:35.138
How's he doing?

37:35.358 --> 37:38.275
Chest is clear.
Setting at 98 on two liters.

37:38.444 --> 37:43.023
I'd give him albuterol
and I'll stop by tomorrow.

37:44.325 --> 37:49.070
- I had a question about DNA testing.
- What about it?

37:49.288 --> 37:53.286
Sometimes we get single moms
who have questions...

37:53.459 --> 37:56.910
...about DNA testing.
Can we do anything here?

37:57.129 --> 38:02.966
Yeah, we've got a kit you can use.
Just call my office.

38:03.178 --> 38:05.384
Great. Thanks.

38:06.806 --> 38:09.178
He said my skin would be discolored.

38:09.392 --> 38:12.346
The new skin will be
sensitive to UV rays.

38:12.562 --> 38:15.728
So you have to use lots of sunscreen.

38:15.940 --> 38:21.065
- So much for my tan next summer.
- Your skin will look younger for it.

38:21.279 --> 38:25.324
There will come a day
when younger is better. Trust me.

38:26.660 --> 38:28.202
What about my hair?

38:28.412 --> 38:31.745
It'll be thinner.
But it will grow back.

38:31.957 --> 38:35.207
- How long does that take?
- Does it grow fast?

38:35.418 --> 38:40.495
- No.
- Well, you might have to wear a wig.

38:40.674 --> 38:43.840
You could go blond.
It's true what they say.

38:45.345 --> 38:48.963
Just be patient.
And if you have any questions...

38:49.182 --> 38:52.682
...call me or Dr. Dave. Okay?

38:53.020 --> 38:54.218
Thank you.

38:59.818 --> 39:01.526
Wow, you're good.

39:01.695 --> 39:03.688
- Thanks.
- I mean really good.

39:03.864 --> 39:05.358
You're welcome, Dave.

39:06.617 --> 39:08.989
- Chief.
- You wanted to see me?

39:09.953 --> 39:13.571
No? I heard you had
a question about my leg.

39:14.166 --> 39:18.164
Me? No, not me. I had a...

39:18.879 --> 39:23.541
...patient with a bad ankle.
Someone must have misunderstood.

39:23.718 --> 39:26.209
Oh. I see. Well...

39:26.429 --> 39:30.841
...if you do ever want to know,
you should just ask.

39:31.058 --> 39:34.557
No problem.
But it's none of my business, right?

39:34.770 --> 39:37.557
No. No, it's not.

39:41.569 --> 39:45.069
If it isn't the lean, Greene
fighting machine.

39:45.240 --> 39:48.406
- It was an accident.
- That you caused.

39:48.576 --> 39:50.035
- Self-defense.
- Oh?

39:50.244 --> 39:55.037
- He attacked Carter.
- Carter didn't crush his throat.

39:55.249 --> 40:00.623
- I want a formal apology to Mr. Perez.
- Fine. Something else?

40:00.838 --> 40:02.581
I didn't bring this on.

40:02.798 --> 40:05.420
I'll try to do damage control...

40:05.634 --> 40:08.506
...but his family will be coming in.

40:08.722 --> 40:10.382
They want a sacrificial lamb...

40:10.599 --> 40:14.596
...and right now,
you are looking pretty woolly.

40:15.103 --> 40:18.388
ER? Hey, Jeanie. How's Carlos?

40:18.606 --> 40:23.268
Good. No, Kerry left already.
Mark?

40:23.486 --> 40:26.155
Yeah. He's right here, honey.

40:28.992 --> 40:30.237
Jeanie, it's Mark.

40:30.451 --> 40:32.492
Sorry I had to rush out.

40:32.704 --> 40:35.705
He's better,
he's just a little wheezy.

40:35.916 --> 40:38.407
Tell Kerry I'll be late tomorrow.

40:38.627 --> 40:39.955
Thanks, Mark.

40:40.128 --> 40:43.213
Okay. Gotta go. Bye.

40:43.507 --> 40:45.049
Hey, you.

40:45.258 --> 40:48.710
Hey, big boy.

40:48.929 --> 40:51.467
How's my favorite little man?

40:52.557 --> 40:54.680
How's my favorite little man?

40:57.020 --> 40:58.183
- John.
- Hi.

40:58.939 --> 41:01.265
What are you doing here?

41:01.942 --> 41:04.433
Can I come in?

41:27.510 --> 41:30.131
If you want me to leave,
just say so.

41:36.519 --> 41:38.677
I don't want your sympathy.

41:41.690 --> 41:42.971
I know.

42:27.237 --> 42:30.820
- Gabe?
- Hey, Kerry.

42:31.825 --> 42:33.485
Is everything all right?

42:34.911 --> 42:38.446
- I think somebody stole my car.
- What?

42:38.665 --> 42:40.991
I never leave it unlocked.

42:41.210 --> 42:43.665
Maybe I did. I left the house
in such a hurry.

42:43.879 --> 42:47.082
- Are you sure you' re on this level?
- What?

42:47.383 --> 42:50.218
- Did you park on this level?
- Yeah.

42:50.427 --> 42:54.092
Every day I park on four
so I can get a space.

42:54.264 --> 42:55.593
This is three.

43:01.730 --> 43:03.473
What an idiot.

43:04.316 --> 43:06.890
After a while they all look the same.

43:07.778 --> 43:11.064
I swear, I'd forget my head
if it wasn't attached.

43:12.616 --> 43:14.574
Do you want me to help?

43:14.785 --> 43:17.739
No, thanks. Please.
I'll see you tomorrow.

43:17.955 --> 43:21.099
- Okay, good night, Gabe.
- Good night.
