<i>I just read that money
as we know it is dead.</i>

01:22.381 --> 01:27.117
Soon the world is only gonna
buy and sell products using Bitcoins.

01:27.119 --> 01:29.385
It's like
a complicated math equation.

01:29.387 --> 01:34.288
So, one day we're gonna buy things
with numbers from a math equation?

01:35.290 --> 01:36.790
Dope, right?

01:36.792 --> 01:38.992
<i>Malcolm Adekanbi is a geek.</i>

01:38.994 --> 01:42.261
<i>Malcolm lives with his single mother
and has only one memory of his father.</i>

01:59.913 --> 02:02.146
<i>Malcolm lives
in Inglewood, California,</i>

02:02.148 --> 02:05.315
<i>in the Darby-Dixon neighborhood
referred to as The Bottoms.</i>

02:25.733 --> 02:27.332
Give me your bike, nigga!

02:27.334 --> 02:30.335
<i>Malcolm's friends,
Jib and Diggy, are also geeks.</i>

02:30.337 --> 02:31.602
Yo.

02:33.104 --> 02:35.338
Shit.

02:35.340 --> 02:38.540
All I want to do is a zoom, zoom, zoom
and the boom, boom.

02:39.442 --> 02:41.543
Word.

02:41.545 --> 02:43.111
<i>Malcolm, Jib and Diggy...</i>

02:43.113 --> 02:46.013
<i>are all deeply obsessed
with '90s hip-hop culture,</i>

02:46.015 --> 02:48.015
<i>submerging themselves
in the music,</i>

02:48.017 --> 02:50.917
<i>watching old</i> Yo! MTV Raps
<i>episodes for fashion tips...</i>

02:50.919 --> 02:52.585
<i>and using the slang.</i>

02:52.587 --> 02:55.120
Huh?
Bro, that shit was whack.

02:55.122 --> 02:57.255
- What?
- They were biting Brand Nubian.

02:57.257 --> 02:58.723
That's not even possible.

02:58.725 --> 03:00.891
Jackpot, niggas.

03:00.893 --> 03:03.860
Gushy, gushy.
Mmm!

03:03.862 --> 03:06.462
<i>Oh, did I mention
that Diggy was a lesbian?</i>

03:06.464 --> 03:09.464
<i>Although from the way she dresses,
you might not have noticed she's a girl.</i>

03:11.733 --> 03:14.868
Save her, Lord!
Yo, hallelujah! Hallelujah!

03:14.870 --> 03:17.937
<i>Every Sunday, her grandmother asks
the church to lay their hands on her...</i>

03:17.939 --> 03:20.306
<i>in order to
pray away the gay.</i>

03:20.308 --> 03:23.108
Praise the Lord!

03:27.145 --> 03:29.746
<i>- So, did it work?</i>
- You know.

03:29.748 --> 03:33.082
I was watching Justin Bieber
the other night and I got a little moist.

03:33.084 --> 03:34.550
Yeah?
So maybe.

03:36.319 --> 03:38.987
- That's just because he's a little ho.
- That's true.

03:38.989 --> 03:40.888
He's a very pretty nigga.
Yes, he is.

03:40.890 --> 03:42.923
What's up, boss?

03:42.925 --> 03:46.593
<i>For most geeks, a bad day
might be being the butt of jokes in class,</i>

03:46.595 --> 03:50.896
<i>the occasional food prank and the worst...
being beat up by a jock.</i>

03:50.898 --> 03:52.764
<i>But when you live
in The Bottoms,</i>

03:52.766 --> 03:55.600
<i>a bad day might be
accidentally getting killed.</i>

03:55.602 --> 03:59.103
<i>Like Wytony Johnson, who got
shot buying a pastrami cheeseburger...</i>

03:59.105 --> 04:01.171
<i>from Jimmy's Burger
on Centinela.</i>

04:01.173 --> 04:03.273
Hey! It's the Rollin' 60s,
dumb-ass niggas!

04:05.143 --> 04:06.942
<i>The real tragedy is...</i>

04:06.944 --> 04:09.244
<i>that he was seconds away
from defeating Ganon.</i>

04:09.246 --> 04:12.380
<i>He had a hell
of a comic book collection.</i>

04:14.316 --> 04:16.817
<i>Jib has been trying to talk
Wytony's mom into giving them to him...</i>

04:16.819 --> 04:19.084
<i>for the past two weeks.</i>

04:20.954 --> 04:24.456
<i>Malcolm, Jib and Diggy don't play
sports and they aren't in a gang.</i>

04:24.458 --> 04:27.592
<i>They're always getting ridiculed by their
peers because they're into white shit...</i>

04:27.594 --> 04:30.795
<i>like skateboards, manga comics,
Donald Glover...</i>

04:30.797 --> 04:34.465
<i>and for listening to white shit like
Trash Talk, TV on the Radio...</i>

04:34.467 --> 04:38.101
<i>and for doing white shit like getting
good grades and applying to college.</i>

04:38.103 --> 04:41.204
<i>Malcolm, Jib and Diggy
used to be in the school marching band,</i>

04:41.206 --> 04:44.674
<i>but quit in protest after refusing
to play the Harlem Shake.</i>

04:44.676 --> 04:46.642
<i>They arranged to use
the music room during lunch...</i>

04:46.644 --> 04:48.977
<i>for their recently formed
punk band, Awreeoh.</i>

04:48.979 --> 04:51.579
One, two.
One, two, three, four!

06:03.538 --> 06:06.071
Hey-hey!
You know the program, niggas.

06:06.073 --> 06:08.106
Shoe program.
Turn around.

06:08.108 --> 06:10.908
Let me see what the fuck
you working with.

06:10.910 --> 06:15.545
Oh, shit, man. All these motherfuckers
got small feet around this bitch.

06:15.547 --> 06:18.347
Goddamn. Nigga, I don't know
why you was looking.

06:18.349 --> 06:21.183
Hey-hey!
My nigga, my G.

06:21.185 --> 06:23.585
Oh, man.
Where the fuck you goin', man?

06:23.587 --> 06:26.554
Goddamn.
What's up with you?

06:26.556 --> 06:29.456
Hey, them last shoes you gave me,
man, I was feeling them.

06:29.458 --> 06:32.525
Classics. The Force 2s?
Yeah, I was liking those.

06:32.527 --> 06:34.260
What's these you got on?

06:34.262 --> 06:36.362
Bro, these are straight
from the flea market.

06:36.364 --> 06:39.264
Shut the fuck up, nigga.
These the J-3s with the red mark on 'em.

06:39.266 --> 06:40.632
Oh, yes.

06:40.634 --> 06:43.001
Come up out those right now.

06:44.203 --> 06:46.270
Right now, nigga!
You speak English?

06:46.272 --> 06:49.005
Do I gotta beat the shit out of
you again and take them?

06:50.107 --> 06:52.141
Damn.

06:52.143 --> 06:55.110
This nigga's speaking African or some shit,
like he don't speak what we speak.

06:55.112 --> 06:56.244
This nigga always...

06:56.246 --> 06:58.179
Hey!

06:59.080 --> 07:01.614
Go, Dig! Come on!

07:01.616 --> 07:03.449
Dig! Go!

07:03.451 --> 07:05.451
Come on, Dig!

07:05.453 --> 07:07.186
Oh, shit!

07:12.091 --> 07:16.060
Hey, hey. Hold up, hold up.
Get your fuckin' hands off me, man!

07:16.062 --> 07:18.829
Don't think I won't
beat your ass, Marquis!

07:18.831 --> 07:22.632
I came up with your daddy.
You better ask him about Stacey.

07:22.634 --> 07:24.834
And see what's what
around this motherfucker!

07:27.903 --> 07:29.870
Let's go, man.

07:31.806 --> 07:34.073
I'm gon' get the other one,
you little, bitch-ass nigga.

07:34.075 --> 07:35.707
Go, man.

07:47.085 --> 07:51.120
Malcolm, when I see stuff
like this personal essay,

07:51.122 --> 07:53.655
I think you're not taking
the process seriously.

07:53.657 --> 07:56.691
I'm... I'm taking it seriously, Mr. Bailey.
I promise.

07:56.693 --> 07:59.160
I'm talking about
something that I love.

07:59.162 --> 08:02.029
I mean, it's well-reasoned,
supported with historical data,

08:02.031 --> 08:04.498
it shows creativity,
critical thinking.

08:04.500 --> 08:09.101
If Neil deGrasse Tyson was writing about
Ice Cube, this is what it would look like.

08:09.103 --> 08:11.369
I suggest you go
in a different direction.

08:11.371 --> 08:14.605
Write something personal
about <i> you.</i>

08:14.607 --> 08:16.406
Your family, your life.

08:19.476 --> 08:23.978
I mean, I... I could write
about the typical...

08:23.980 --> 08:27.881
"I'm from a poor,
crime-filled neighborhood,

08:27.883 --> 08:30.683
raised by a single mother,
don't know my dad" blah-blah.

08:30.685 --> 08:32.116
It's clichÃ©.

08:32.119 --> 08:35.285
This here, this...
This is...

08:35.288 --> 08:37.821
This is creative.
This shows that I'm different.

08:37.823 --> 08:40.456
This is the kind of essay
that Harvard wants from their students.

08:40.457 --> 08:42.890
Malcolm, I'm gonna be
honest with you.

08:42.893 --> 08:45.759
You're pretty damn arrogant.
You think you're gonna get into Harvard?

08:47.394 --> 08:49.962
Who do you think
you are? Hmm?

08:49.964 --> 08:52.197
You go to high school
in Inglewood.

08:52.199 --> 08:55.834
To the admissions committee,
your straight A's, they don't mean shit.

08:55.836 --> 08:59.070
If you're really serious about this exercise
and you're not just wasting my time,

08:59.072 --> 09:00.805
or yours,

09:00.807 --> 09:04.008
then it's gonna be about
your personal statement,

09:04.010 --> 09:07.478
your SAT scores,
your recommendations...

09:07.480 --> 09:09.913
and most importantly
your alumni interview tomorrow.

09:09.915 --> 09:12.582
- Are you ready?
- I'm ready.

09:12.584 --> 09:14.951
You'd better be.

09:14.953 --> 09:17.753
I just found out you're interviewing
with Austin Jacoby.

09:19.756 --> 09:23.291
He's from Inglewood too, so he'll be
able to relate to your circumstances.

09:23.293 --> 09:25.326
Jacoby Check Cashing?

09:25.328 --> 09:27.494
Harvard? Really?

09:29.698 --> 09:32.832
I'm sorry. They don't all
go on to be president.

09:39.172 --> 09:41.306
<i>On this day,</i>

09:41.308 --> 09:43.941
<i>their usual route home
is blocked by a Blood gathering.</i>

09:43.943 --> 09:46.023
<i>They were shooting a video
for their YouTube channel.</i>

09:52.882 --> 09:55.483
Well, where do you want to go?

09:55.485 --> 09:59.186
Some nigga really needs to invent an app
like Waze to avoid all these hood traps.

10:00.821 --> 10:03.522
<i>The only way to get home
is down 104th Street.</i>

10:03.524 --> 10:05.690
<i>But that's where
the dope dealers are...</i>

10:05.692 --> 10:08.726
<i>who, for sport, routinely
try to steal their bikes.</i>

10:12.564 --> 10:15.131
- Go!
- Hey, little nigga.

10:15.133 --> 10:18.534
- <i>Such is the life of a geek in The Bottoms.</i>
- Come here.

10:18.536 --> 10:21.503
<i>A daily navigation between
bad and worse choices.</i>

10:21.505 --> 10:23.204
Come here, little nigga.

10:31.212 --> 10:33.546
Yo, man.

10:33.548 --> 10:37.883
I be seein' you and your little friends
with y'all flattops and MC Hammer pants,

10:37.885 --> 10:41.605
riding around in this shit, looking like
y'all came out of a DeLorean or some shit.

10:44.390 --> 10:47.958
You know, the '90s was like
the golden age of hip-hop.

10:49.393 --> 10:52.228
Everything from
<i>It Takes a Nation of Millions...</i>

10:52.230 --> 10:54.863
to <i> The Blueprint</i> was killing it.

10:54.865 --> 10:57.765
I guess me and my friends
just wish we grew up back then.

10:57.767 --> 11:00.501
<i>It Takes a Nation</i>
came out in '88.

11:00.503 --> 11:02.369
<i>Blueprint</i> came out 2001.

11:02.371 --> 11:04.811
What the fuck are you
talkin' 'bout right now?

11:05.672 --> 11:07.506
Technically, um...

11:09.542 --> 11:12.544
But, you know, the spirit of the music
was definitely still '90s.

11:12.546 --> 11:15.446
I mean,<i> It Takes a Nation,</i>
<i>Straight Outta Compton...</i>

11:15.448 --> 11:17.114
<i>Paid in Full</i>
was ahead of their time.

11:17.116 --> 11:19.683
And then you got
Snoop, Biggie, Wu-Tang.

11:19.685 --> 11:21.885
They took the game
to the next level.

11:21.887 --> 11:24.587
<i>Blueprint</i> was kind of like
the punctuation mark.

11:24.589 --> 11:27.222
Let's not forget,
the '90s also gave us...

11:27.224 --> 11:29.524
Vanilla Ice, MC Hammer...

11:29.526 --> 11:32.226
and we can't forget
about the Fresh Prince.

11:32.228 --> 11:36.395
Everything in the '90s
wasn't great, but... Oh, shit.

11:36.397 --> 11:38.497
But you gotta admit
"Summertime" was a classic.

11:39.632 --> 11:41.299
What's your name, little nigga?

11:41.301 --> 11:43.534
Uh, it's Malcolm.

11:43.536 --> 11:46.603
Look here, Malcolm.
I want you to do a favor for me.

11:46.605 --> 11:50.974
You see that green apartment there
in the middle of the block?

11:54.078 --> 11:56.279
There's a nice little piece
over there.

11:56.281 --> 11:59.481
I want you to go up to her
and tell her that Dom wants to talk to her.

12:00.415 --> 12:02.749
Uh, th-that's... that's it?

12:02.751 --> 12:04.550
Yeah, nigga.
Can you handle that?

12:04.552 --> 12:07.452
Uh... y-yeah.

12:07.454 --> 12:09.020
Get to pedalin', nigga.

12:12.224 --> 12:14.024
Drop that up here.

12:17.461 --> 12:19.261
Yeah.

12:38.780 --> 12:40.714
You gonna say something
or just stare at me?

12:41.949 --> 12:45.117
Um, Dom says...

12:45.119 --> 12:48.353
that he would like you
to come over and talk to him.

12:50.155 --> 12:53.457
Well, why don't you tell Dom
that if he wants to talk to me,

12:53.459 --> 12:55.859
he can come over here
and be a fucking man...

12:55.861 --> 12:57.694
and not send a little kid
to talk for him?

12:58.629 --> 13:00.563
Tell him just like that.

13:01.498 --> 13:03.365
She said that shit?

13:03.367 --> 13:07.936
And that Dominique
was way cooler before he became Dom.

13:07.938 --> 13:13.774
And, um, that if you think that she cares
about your dope money, sh-she doesn't.

13:13.776 --> 13:18.010
Listen, tell her that I'm throwing a
birthday party at Verse tonight...

13:18.012 --> 13:20.745
and I would really enjoy
the pleasure of her company.

13:22.013 --> 13:23.713
Go ahead, nigga.

13:27.951 --> 13:30.953
You should, uh...
You should work inside out.

13:30.955 --> 13:34.556
Do the stuff in the brackets first
and then square the sum.

13:43.331 --> 13:44.731
Yep.

13:46.200 --> 13:48.434
Okay. Thanks.

13:50.804 --> 13:53.205
Oh! Uh...

13:53.207 --> 13:57.475
Dom says he's throwing
a birthday party tonight at Verse.

13:57.477 --> 13:59.210
Mm-hmm.

13:59.212 --> 14:03.080
He said he'd really love
the, uh... the pleasure of your company.

14:03.082 --> 14:06.049
That nigga did not say that.

14:06.051 --> 14:08.584
He did. I s...

14:08.586 --> 14:10.152
I swear. He...

14:10.154 --> 14:12.087
Lord.

14:14.756 --> 14:17.724
Well, I'll go if you go.

14:18.759 --> 14:20.659
I'll save you a dance.

14:23.863 --> 14:25.363
<i>You are going.</i>

14:25.365 --> 14:27.498
<i>We</i> are going.

14:27.500 --> 14:30.567
She metaphorically showed you her pussy
and said, "Come and fuck me."

14:30.569 --> 14:34.103
Jib, um, this is Dom
we're talking about.

14:34.105 --> 14:37.106
We're not going to
a drug dealer's birthday party.

14:37.108 --> 14:39.341
That's... You're trippin'.

14:39.343 --> 14:41.823
We're in our senior year, bitches.
Okay?

14:42.878 --> 14:46.046
- It is time we started expanding our horizons.
- No.

14:46.048 --> 14:49.382
Call your mom and tell her you're...
you're studying late at my place.

14:49.384 --> 14:51.250
Come on. Dig? Huh?

14:51.252 --> 14:53.818
Look, it's better than what
you normally do at night, so...

15:01.392 --> 15:03.126
Mm-hmm.

15:07.065 --> 15:08.764
Looking beautiful. Oh!

15:08.766 --> 15:10.966
One, two and <i> tres.</i>

15:10.968 --> 15:13.368
Been working on my Spa...
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

15:13.370 --> 15:16.204
- What you doing?
- You let them in without checking the list.

15:16.206 --> 15:17.905
What's up?

15:17.907 --> 15:20.474
Okay, let me educate you
real quick.

15:20.476 --> 15:23.810
I am the gatekeeper,
I'm the grandmaster, the authority...

15:23.812 --> 15:27.480
in keeping
a proper nigga-to-ho ratio.

15:27.482 --> 15:29.748
You understand what I'm saying?

15:29.750 --> 15:32.751
So unless you little niggas got some pussies,
I'm gon' need y'all to get the fuck...

15:32.753 --> 15:35.286
- I have one.

15:35.288 --> 15:38.155
I know y'all some bitches,
but you ain't gotta say you got pussies.

15:38.157 --> 15:40.257
She... She's a girl.

15:40.259 --> 15:42.225
What?

15:42.227 --> 15:45.661
This little nigga's a bitch!

15:45.663 --> 15:48.563
Like... Like <i> Boys Don't Cry</i>
like a motherfucker.

15:48.565 --> 15:51.132
Remember when we was seein' that shit?
Yeah, I remember that.

15:51.134 --> 15:53.167
Nigga, what the fuck.
Let us in.

15:53.169 --> 15:56.236
Oh, well, yeah, yeah.
You know, it's 21 and older.

15:56.238 --> 15:58.637
I'm gon' need some ID,
some verification.

16:00.339 --> 16:02.606
- Uh...
- Oh.

16:02.608 --> 16:04.908
Wait.
Y'all don't have no IDs?

16:06.644 --> 16:10.013
Aw! Sorry! I'm gon' need y'all
to get the fuck off.

16:10.015 --> 16:11.948
Come on.
Get the fuck off.

16:11.950 --> 16:15.751
There's a Baskin-Robbins down the street.
Enjoy yourselves.

16:15.753 --> 16:19.254
Hey, man, don't this dude look like the
dude that danced in Santa Monica?

16:19.256 --> 16:21.936
- Breakdance?
- Don't he look like... What the fuck.

16:22.957 --> 16:24.757
You're coming in, right?

16:30.296 --> 16:32.363
Get the fuck outta here, man!

16:32.365 --> 16:34.031
Get the fuck outta here, man.

16:34.033 --> 16:37.267
Old Coolio-looking motherfucker.
Hey, baby. You're looking good.

16:37.269 --> 16:38.968
Thank you.

16:38.970 --> 16:42.604
Digs. Digs. Digs. Jib. Jib.
Come on, come on.

16:48.042 --> 16:49.942
Hey. Hey, w-wait... Hey!

16:51.946 --> 16:54.947
Yo, yo, yo. It's cool.
It's cool. Let 'em in.

16:54.949 --> 16:57.716
Look, I ca...
I can't let you do that.

16:57.718 --> 17:00.952
These kids are underage
and I cannot lose my license tonight.

17:00.954 --> 17:02.454
Not tonight.

17:02.456 --> 17:05.390
I don't mind having
this discussion with you.

17:05.392 --> 17:08.059
I actually enjoy the thoughtful
exchange of ideas.

17:08.060 --> 17:10.594
And you do bring up a valid point.
Know what I'm sayin'?

17:10.596 --> 17:13.630
But see, you put me
in a bit of a spot, nigga.

17:13.632 --> 17:16.799
'Cause I can't have you back-talkin' me
in front of my niggas...

17:16.800 --> 17:18.634
without at least
fuckin' your ass up.

17:18.636 --> 17:20.335
You feel me?
You don't have to do that.

17:20.337 --> 17:23.404
I kinda do though. I don't want to.
It's my birthday and shit.

17:23.406 --> 17:26.339
But there's principles to this shit,
and I'm a principled man.

17:26.342 --> 17:29.743
- They in, Dom. It's all good.
- I know they got in. That's my point.

17:29.745 --> 17:34.180
But I got this nigga telling me what he can't
let me do and shit. Like I give a fuck.

17:34.182 --> 17:36.815
Man, if I let this shit slide,
we got what they call a slippery slope.

17:36.817 --> 17:38.817
You know what
a slippery slope is, nigga?

17:38.819 --> 17:41.319
No. I don't...
I don't know what a slippery...

17:41.321 --> 17:43.187
Anyone?

17:43.189 --> 17:45.355
Do it got anything
to do with skiing?

17:45.357 --> 17:47.657
Nigga, sit your ass down, man.

17:47.659 --> 17:49.925
I know using your brain
is a challenge and shit.

17:49.927 --> 17:52.661
You use skis on a slope... You might
fuck around, give yourself a concussion.

17:52.663 --> 17:55.096
It's a small event that leads to
a chain reaction of events...

17:55.098 --> 17:56.864
with unintended consequences...

17:56.866 --> 17:59.566
that were unforeseen at the time
of the inciting event.

18:03.837 --> 18:06.972
See, this is a smart little nigga
right in here, bro.

18:06.974 --> 18:10.054
You probably got one of them
"photogetic" brains or some shit, huh?

18:10.942 --> 18:12.976
You mean photographic memory?

18:12.978 --> 18:16.112
- Nigga, what I just say?
- I mean, yeah, y-you said it.

18:16.114 --> 18:18.114
I'm reiterating that...

18:18.116 --> 18:21.183
I'm still a little shaky
on the concept.

18:21.185 --> 18:24.152
Basically, if I let
this nigga slide, man,

18:24.154 --> 18:26.354
then I'm going to have
the next nigga coming along,

18:26.356 --> 18:28.622
thinking they can pop off and shit,
you know what I'm sayin'?

18:28.624 --> 18:30.056
And so on and so forth.

18:30.957 --> 18:33.458
Damn!

18:33.460 --> 18:37.295
- Oh, shit.
- Hey, little nigga, you coming in?

18:37.297 --> 18:40.431
Yo, it's cool.
You coming in, Malcolm?

18:44.502 --> 18:46.803
Nigga, come on.

18:52.909 --> 18:54.676
Yeah.

18:54.678 --> 18:57.912
Nigga, school's out.
What the fuck you doing with a bag on?

18:57.914 --> 19:00.014
Hey, throw this behind the bar
for my little homey.

19:00.016 --> 19:02.883
Yo, let me get a round of shots.
Cheers.

20:29.886 --> 20:31.452
Hi.

20:35.489 --> 20:38.524
So, are you gonna ask me
to dance or what?

21:03.443 --> 21:05.010
I think you said
something about me...

21:05.012 --> 21:07.445
being man enough
to come talk to you.

21:07.447 --> 21:10.448
Can I have this dance, Nakia?
It's my birthday, you know.

21:10.450 --> 21:11.982
Hey, uh...

21:13.684 --> 21:15.451
We were dancing, man.

21:17.688 --> 21:20.288
Kids say the darndest things,
don't they?

21:20.290 --> 21:23.858
See, this is what happens
when you don't spank your children.

21:33.133 --> 21:35.733
Anyways... Why do you
have to talk to him like that?

21:43.975 --> 21:46.208
- You look nice tonight.
- Dom.

22:05.792 --> 22:09.227
Boom!
Damn, nigga, that was ill.

22:09.229 --> 22:12.296
This nigga doesn't know what hit him.
Check this nigga out.

22:12.298 --> 22:14.731
He's walking his jihad dog and shit,
scratching his nuts.

22:15.966 --> 22:18.667
Yahtzee, nigga.
Ooh, this shit crazy.

22:18.669 --> 22:23.070
Yo, man, straight up, I really used
to think Obama was a bitch, man.

22:23.072 --> 22:24.971
Drones though, nigga?

22:24.973 --> 22:27.573
That's some gangsta shit.
I need one of those motherfuckers.

22:27.575 --> 22:30.342
This shit ain't funny.

22:30.344 --> 22:32.510
It's fucked up
if you really think about it.

22:32.512 --> 22:35.546
How, nigga?
He killing all them Al-Qaedas and shit.

22:35.548 --> 22:37.848
Nigga, that ain't all
that gets killed.

22:37.850 --> 22:40.183
And that nigga's saying
he can drone-strike Americans too.

22:40.185 --> 22:42.752
They killed an American
working with them niggas in Yemen.

22:42.754 --> 22:46.021
Man, he was a terrorist, dawg.
So it's like set trippin'.

22:46.023 --> 22:47.822
You can't decide
to be a Blood...

22:47.824 --> 22:49.990
and then get mad
if the Crips try to kill you and shit.

22:49.992 --> 22:51.858
Man, all I'm saying is...

22:51.860 --> 22:54.927
this shit started somewhere
like Pakistan or some shit.

22:54.929 --> 22:57.596
And before you know it, they'll start
saying that <i> we're</i> the terrorists.

22:57.598 --> 22:59.831
They're gonna have planes
riding all around Inglewood,

22:59.833 --> 23:02.600
droppin' bombs on Crenshaw
and shit, man.

23:02.602 --> 23:05.102
Ah, slippery slope.
Exact, nigga.

23:05.104 --> 23:08.738
Shit, I wish a nigga
would try to fly drones in my hood.

23:08.740 --> 23:10.840
- Fuck that.
- Hell yeah.

23:10.842 --> 23:14.343
<i>I wish I would see one of
them motherfuckers in Inglewood, man.</i>

23:14.345 --> 23:17.346
<i>For real. Don't let them
niggas come to my hood.</i>

23:17.348 --> 23:19.081
What you got there?

23:19.083 --> 23:20.882
- Ah!
- Whoo!

23:20.884 --> 23:23.584
Breakfast Club, nigga.
Molly Ringwald.

23:23.586 --> 23:26.019
So, this the latest and greatest shit, huh?
Yes, sir.

23:26.021 --> 23:28.554
Pure as a nun's pussy.
Know what I'm sayin'?

23:28.556 --> 23:30.956
This ain't like that ghetto shit
y'all niggas been fucking with either, man.

23:30.958 --> 23:33.058
This is that A-1 shit.

23:33.060 --> 23:35.740
A.J. say you ready to move out
the D-league and move up to the NBA.

24:00.914 --> 24:03.348
- Oh, shit.
- Jesus!

24:05.050 --> 24:08.118
Get the fuck out of here!
Let's move. Go!

24:11.822 --> 24:14.756
Nakia! Nakia.

24:21.663 --> 24:24.030
Are you all right?
Yeah, I'm fine.

24:26.400 --> 24:28.534
Malcolm!

24:31.304 --> 24:34.039
Shit.
Come on. I drove.

24:48.120 --> 24:50.921
Thanks for helping me.

24:50.923 --> 24:54.024
Most of those niggas
just saw me and stepped over me.

24:54.026 --> 24:56.159
Luckily for you,
I'm not one of those niggas.

24:57.427 --> 24:59.961
Oh, really?

24:59.963 --> 25:02.730
- What are you, then?
- I don't know.

25:02.732 --> 25:05.499
I'm just...
I'm black as fuck, right?

25:08.703 --> 25:12.137
Uh, I guess I'm just used to
hearing that, uh,

25:13.806 --> 25:17.108
niggas don't listen to this,
niggas don't do that,

25:17.110 --> 25:22.045
niggas don't go to college
unless they play ball or whatever.

25:22.047 --> 25:26.348
It's just time to accept it.
I'm just not one of those niggas.

25:27.917 --> 25:29.951
Well, me neither then.

25:29.953 --> 25:32.586
'Cause I'm going to college.

25:32.588 --> 25:34.921
Just gotta get my GED first.

25:34.923 --> 25:39.291
That's what you were studying for.
Mm-hmm. Yeah.

25:39.293 --> 25:43.394
If I pass, I'll go to El Camino
or Santa Monica or something.

25:43.396 --> 25:45.696
Transfer to Dominguez
or Northridge.

25:46.931 --> 25:50.366
Well, you shouldn't
sell yourself short.

25:52.168 --> 25:54.302
You could do better.

25:54.304 --> 25:57.204
You hardly know me.
So how can you say that?

25:58.139 --> 25:59.672
I can just tell.

26:01.574 --> 26:04.041
You shouldn't settle
for what's expected.

26:05.176 --> 26:07.209
Like Dom, right?

26:08.778 --> 26:10.812
I...

26:10.814 --> 26:12.747
I didn't say that.

26:12.749 --> 26:14.849
Don't try and be slick.

26:14.851 --> 26:17.351
You're trying to block him.

26:18.786 --> 26:21.187
So, you two...

26:21.189 --> 26:23.455
Y-You guys...
It's complicated.

26:23.457 --> 26:25.590
But trust me,
he's got nothing on you.

26:25.592 --> 26:29.393
You probably got all the girls
lined up asking you to prom and shit.

26:34.765 --> 26:37.933
You making fun of me?
N-No.

26:39.135 --> 26:40.568
I'm sorry.

26:42.437 --> 26:44.604
Hey, I didn't go
to my prom.

26:44.606 --> 26:47.440
You didn't go to your prom?
Seriously.

26:47.442 --> 26:52.077
I had one guy ask me... Anthony Davis...
and he fucking stood me up.

26:54.980 --> 26:56.814
I didn't even care
about missing prom.

26:56.816 --> 27:00.450
I was more mad about not going
to Six Flags the next day.

27:00.452 --> 27:03.419
All my friends had dates.
I didn't want to go alone.

27:06.990 --> 27:09.591
Would you want to
go to prom with me?

27:16.397 --> 27:18.164
I mean, I...

27:18.166 --> 27:22.400
I know that
I'm not complicated or... But...

27:22.402 --> 27:24.769
It's just with studying and all,

27:26.071 --> 27:27.938
I don't think
I'll have time.

27:30.041 --> 27:31.708
But thank you.

27:33.310 --> 27:37.579
What if I helped you study?
And what if you passed the GED?

27:39.315 --> 27:41.616
Would you go with me then?

27:44.920 --> 27:46.452
I'll think about it.

27:48.354 --> 27:49.987
Okay.

27:52.857 --> 27:56.025
Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

27:56.027 --> 27:58.093
Oh, shit.

27:58.095 --> 28:01.162
Three words.
Did you fuck?

28:03.064 --> 28:05.098
You're a pussy, nigga.
Come on, man.

28:05.100 --> 28:07.333
She let me feel her titties
and finger-bang her.

28:07.335 --> 28:09.368
Bullshit.
No, I'm dead-ass serious.

28:09.370 --> 28:12.003
Smell my fingers.
I don't smell shit.

28:12.005 --> 28:13.838
Just cream.
You never smelled pussy before.

28:13.840 --> 28:15.506
Wait. I have.

28:15.508 --> 28:17.207
I don't smell shit.

28:17.209 --> 28:19.275
See, she don't smell shit either.
'Cause you only know your pussy.

28:19.277 --> 28:21.443
Exactly!

28:21.445 --> 28:23.945
- Wait, wait, wait. Hold it.
- Whoa, whoa.

28:23.947 --> 28:26.781
Wait a minute.
You two go back through, one at a time.

28:26.783 --> 28:28.249
One at a time.

28:28.251 --> 28:30.618
What's getting into you?
Come on.

28:35.424 --> 28:37.323
Hey, hey. Calm down.

28:39.726 --> 28:42.627
Go. Everybody else wait.
Turn around, go back.

28:42.629 --> 28:45.496
We gotta do pat-downs.
The machine is broke.

28:54.939 --> 28:56.673
Oh, shit.

29:06.950 --> 29:10.084
Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

29:10.086 --> 29:12.052
Yo, yo, yo.
Oh, shit!

29:12.054 --> 29:14.287
What's wrong? What?

29:14.289 --> 29:16.789
Oh, shit.

29:16.791 --> 29:19.958
Fuck! Is that real?

29:19.960 --> 29:23.461
Boy, how'd you get this shit?
I have no fucking clue, Jib. No fucking clue.

29:23.463 --> 29:24.962
What do you mean
you don't have a fucking clue?

29:24.964 --> 29:28.832
I have no fucking clue
where that gun came from.

29:28.834 --> 29:30.366
Or the drugs.

29:32.602 --> 29:34.502
Drop your weapons!

29:40.173 --> 29:42.707
Get the fuck outta here.
Let's move. Go!

29:44.109 --> 29:46.477
Last night at...
At the fucking party.

29:46.479 --> 29:49.513
At the party. Dom put that shit
in my bag. Had to be.

29:49.515 --> 29:52.649
Well, we gotta get rid of it then.
You know? Dump it, or...

29:52.651 --> 29:55.318
Or take it to the police.
Yeah. Let's take it to the police.

29:55.320 --> 29:57.987
Are you joking?

29:57.989 --> 30:01.290
You want three niggas
to take a bag full of dope and a gun...

30:01.292 --> 30:03.191
to the fucking police station?

30:03.193 --> 30:05.860
Like, "Here you go"?
N...

30:05.862 --> 30:09.864
And... And you don't expect Dom
to find out who snitched?

30:09.866 --> 30:12.499
- Well, what do you wanna do with it?
- Yo, that's a lot of weight.

30:12.501 --> 30:15.335
It's like 20, 30 keys.
I don't know.

30:15.337 --> 30:17.770
- It's a lot of shit, right?
- I don't know, Dig.

30:17.772 --> 30:19.872
I don't know anything
about this shit.

30:19.874 --> 30:23.175
All I know is Jeezy paid LeBron
and Jay paid Dwyane Wade.

30:23.177 --> 30:25.677
What?
He was talking about dope?

30:29.948 --> 30:32.215
Shit.

30:32.217 --> 30:34.217
I-I-I-I answered it.

30:34.219 --> 30:36.452
You did what?
I don't want that shit.

30:36.454 --> 30:38.587
Shit.

30:43.125 --> 30:45.091
- Hello?
- <i>Who the fuck is this?</i>

30:47.027 --> 30:49.561
U-Um, who is this?

30:49.563 --> 30:52.864
<i>This the nigga that's gon' fuck you up,
you keep asking questions.</i>

30:52.866 --> 30:55.399
<i>Now, who the fuck is this?</i>

30:57.235 --> 30:59.502
I prefer not to say.

30:59.504 --> 31:01.971
<i>Okay, I see how
we gon' do this then.</i>

31:01.973 --> 31:05.640
<i>If this ain't a nigga named
Malcolm at Yukon and 104th Street,</i>

31:05.642 --> 31:07.742
<i>then I'm gon' kill your ass.</i>

31:07.744 --> 31:11.045
How do you know where I am?
<i>Find an iPhone.</i>

31:11.047 --> 31:13.714
<i>Steve Jobs a motherfucking genius.</i>
Oh, shit.

31:13.716 --> 31:16.083
<i>Now, if this a nigga named Malcolm,
say, "Damn right."</i>

31:16.085 --> 31:19.319
<i>Otherwise,
click-click-boom.</i>

31:19.321 --> 31:22.555
Damn right.
Damn right, my name is Malcolm.

31:22.557 --> 31:24.223
<i>Malcolm. Malcolm!</i>

31:24.225 --> 31:26.558
<i>How you feeling, man?</i>

31:26.560 --> 31:29.427
<i>Dom told me there was a mix-up.
You accidentally took my lunch. That true?</i>

31:29.429 --> 31:32.430
- Took your lunch?
- <i>Yeah, my lunch.</i>

31:32.432 --> 31:34.932
<i>A nigga hungry.</i>
Yes. Yes, I...

31:34.934 --> 31:38.068
Yeah. Uh-huh.
Baloney sandwich. Mm-hmm.

31:38.070 --> 31:40.503
<i>Baloney.
It got cheese on it?</i>

31:40.505 --> 31:42.571
Yeah. Mm-hmm.

31:42.573 --> 31:44.739
<i>We talking about
the same sandwich, nigga?</i>

31:44.741 --> 31:46.841
<i>'Cause I ain't ask
for no cheese.</i>

31:46.843 --> 31:50.677
<i>I find that my fucking sandwich
got cheese on it, I'm gon' kill your ass.</i>

31:50.679 --> 31:53.946
I don't know.

31:53.948 --> 31:56.381
You just... You know,
there's a bag and...

31:56.383 --> 31:58.416
<i>What? What?</i>

31:58.418 --> 32:01.619
<i>You're the one wanted to get all cute,
talkin' 'bout baloney sandwiches and shit.</i>

32:01.621 --> 32:04.221
- <i>I just asked you if you had my lunch.</i>
- Yeah.

32:04.223 --> 32:06.524
Yeah, you're right.
You're right.

32:06.526 --> 32:09.159
Uh, your lunch. It's right here.
I'm looking at it right now.

32:09.161 --> 32:11.127
<i>Coolio.</i>

32:11.129 --> 32:13.896
<i>Now, after school, you're gon'
see a red El Camino parked...</i>

32:13.898 --> 32:15.998
<i>and this
handsome-ass nigga inside.</i>

32:16.000 --> 32:18.900
<i>That ain't Lance Gross, nigga.
That's yours truly.</i>

32:18.902 --> 32:22.570
<i>Just walk up, hand me the
baloney sandwich and be on your way.</i>

32:22.572 --> 32:26.640
<i>You have a nice, happy,
productive life with a hell of a story to tell.</i>

32:26.642 --> 32:29.475
<i>You got it?</i>
Yeah. Yeah, I got it.

32:30.577 --> 32:33.045
Red El Camino after school.
Cool.

32:33.047 --> 32:35.414
<i>It's almost over,
little nigga.</i>

32:35.416 --> 32:37.115
<i>You did good.</i>

32:39.985 --> 32:43.120
What the fuck did we
get ourselves into, man?

32:45.723 --> 32:47.256
I don't see it.

32:51.426 --> 32:52.925
Where is it?

32:55.061 --> 32:58.063
Yo, he's over there.

32:58.065 --> 33:00.198
- Where?
- To the right.

33:00.200 --> 33:02.500
Oh, I see him.

33:02.502 --> 33:04.568
You good?
Yeah. Yeah, let's go.

33:04.570 --> 33:06.170
You good?
All right. Yeah.

33:11.542 --> 33:13.743
He asked for you alone,
you know?

33:13.745 --> 33:17.412
I got your back and all. It's just I don't
wanna mess with his explicit instructions.

33:17.414 --> 33:20.214
You'll be fine, bro.

33:20.216 --> 33:22.049
Right?

33:22.051 --> 33:23.850
You're just dropping it off.
You're good.

33:37.796 --> 33:40.864
Uh, hey. Yeah.

33:40.866 --> 33:42.799
I'm, uh...
I got your lunch.

33:42.801 --> 33:45.968
I'm walking to the red
El Camino right now.

33:45.970 --> 33:47.436
<i>What you say?</i>

33:48.805 --> 33:52.207
Who's this?
<i>This is Dom, man.</i>

33:52.209 --> 33:55.476
<i>Look, do you have
what I left in the backpack?</i>

33:55.478 --> 33:58.812
Yeah. Yeah.
You in the red El Camino?

33:58.814 --> 34:00.580
<i>What the fuck
you talking about?</i>

34:00.582 --> 34:03.449
Somebody called me earlier saying
I need to bring him the sandwich.

34:03.451 --> 34:07.285
<i>Nigga, why the fuck are you
talking about sandwiches right now?</i>

34:07.287 --> 34:10.288
The... The backpack.

34:10.290 --> 34:14.324
He... The guy, he said that I needed
to bring it to him after school.

34:14.327 --> 34:16.327
He'd be in a red El Camino.

34:18.664 --> 34:22.065
Yo, McFly, I want you to listen to
what I'm about to tell you right now.

34:22.067 --> 34:23.800
Somebody snitched.

34:23.802 --> 34:26.235
<i>I'm in County right now.
I don't know who the fuck called you.</i>

34:26.237 --> 34:28.070
There's two possibilities.

34:28.072 --> 34:30.505
Either the motherfucker
in the El Camino is POPO...

34:30.507 --> 34:32.672
As soon as you give him
the package, he gon' arrest you.

34:32.675 --> 34:34.908
<i>Or that motherfucker's
the snitch.</i>

34:34.909 --> 34:37.577
<i>In that case,
he'll take the package, kill you,</i>

34:37.579 --> 34:39.844
<i>then I'm headed to Chino
with a price on my head.</i>

34:39.847 --> 34:42.781
I'm gon' need you to trust me
right about now, you understand?

34:42.783 --> 34:47.016
<i>Do not take that backpack to the nigga in
the whip, else we both fucked. Hear me?</i>

34:47.018 --> 34:49.152
I'm gonna text you this address.

34:49.154 --> 34:52.688
Go there, ask for A.J.
Tell him it's about the Boys Club.

34:52.690 --> 34:55.424
<i>Give him the package.</i>
<i>Tell him it's from me.</i>
<i>You hear me?</i>

34:55.426 --> 34:57.959
<i>Nigga, run. Get the fuck
out of there, nigga.</i>

34:57.961 --> 35:00.494
<i>Run. Go now!</i>
<i>Get the fuck out of there!</i> Oh, shit.

35:00.496 --> 35:03.129
<i>Go!</i>
Oh, shit. Oh, shit!

35:03.131 --> 35:05.698
Oh, shit. Oh, shit.
Oh, shit.

35:07.802 --> 35:10.369
Go! Let's go! Come on!

35:14.205 --> 35:16.372
Go, Jib!

35:23.212 --> 35:25.846
- Get the fuck back over here!
- Oh, shit!

35:25.848 --> 35:29.049
Let's go! Let's go!
Move the fucking car!

35:29.051 --> 35:30.617
Let's go!

35:30.619 --> 35:32.218
Come on!

35:39.826 --> 35:42.627
Yo, man, what the hell happened?
Who the fuck was that?

35:42.629 --> 35:44.061
Dom.
What?

35:44.063 --> 35:46.163
Dom!

35:46.165 --> 35:49.533
That nigga called me and said that the
nigga that called earlier isn't with him.

35:49.535 --> 35:51.201
Well, then who is he?

35:52.303 --> 35:55.171
Oh, shit.

35:55.173 --> 35:56.872
Oh, shit.

35:56.874 --> 35:59.273
How the fuck did they find us?
Yo, let's go.

36:08.415 --> 36:10.616
Jib! Dig! Bus!

36:20.826 --> 36:23.327
There. Right here.
Right ahead.

36:23.329 --> 36:24.961
It's that bus.
It's that bus.

36:26.997 --> 36:29.131
Right there. Right there.
They on that bus!

36:30.333 --> 36:31.900
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

36:37.038 --> 36:39.105
Open the fucking door!

36:39.107 --> 36:40.973
Open the fucking door, bitch!

36:45.112 --> 36:47.378
You see three little niggas
get on this bus a couple stops ago?

36:47.380 --> 36:50.180
I don't know.
Lot of young niggas get on this bus.

36:50.182 --> 36:52.949
Don't get smart. I'm just asking
you a motherfucking question, all right?

36:52.951 --> 36:54.650
I don't see shit
but the road.

36:59.623 --> 37:02.489
He's here.

37:03.924 --> 37:06.725
Is it you? Huh?

37:06.727 --> 37:09.928
Is it you? Huh?
Is it fuckin' you?

37:17.268 --> 37:19.469
<i>Congratulations.
You have found your iPhone.</i>

37:19.471 --> 37:21.204
Damn.

38:10.978 --> 38:14.478
Yo, Lily, what are you doing
opening the door butt-ass naked for?

38:17.081 --> 38:19.982
Excuse my dumb-ass sister, man.
What up?

38:19.984 --> 38:21.283
Are you A.J.?

38:21.285 --> 38:23.852
No, that's my dad.

38:23.854 --> 38:25.353
I need to speak to him.

38:26.521 --> 38:28.522
It's about Boys Club.

38:28.524 --> 38:31.024
Right. Right.

38:31.026 --> 38:33.593
Well, my dad's at his office
for a couple of hours.

38:33.595 --> 38:36.128
But y'all can hang out here
until he gets back if you want.

38:36.130 --> 38:37.462
Um...
No.

38:37.464 --> 38:39.230
You know...

38:43.467 --> 38:44.967
Hey.
Yeah.

38:44.969 --> 38:47.769
- You wanna come in?
- Yeah. Yeah.

38:47.771 --> 38:49.704
Y'all come in.

38:58.980 --> 39:02.214
You Piru?
Crenshaw Mafia?

39:02.216 --> 39:05.416
Uh, I'm just Malcolm.

39:06.618 --> 39:09.386
That's your hood, though.
Right? Right?

39:15.124 --> 39:16.690
Yeah.

39:19.126 --> 39:20.826
Yeah.
Yeah.

39:23.630 --> 39:25.796
Yeah.

39:25.798 --> 39:27.831
In the guest house
is where I got my studio.

39:27.833 --> 39:30.167
That's where I lay down
my tracks.

39:54.953 --> 39:57.486
I fuck around with it, you know.
I do my little thing.

39:57.488 --> 40:01.156
My style is, I'm like a Dilla meets a No ID
with a little bit of splash of Rick Rubin.

40:01.158 --> 40:03.191
- Right.
- Know what I mean?

40:03.193 --> 40:06.093
I actually got something that
I did the other day. Check this out.

40:21.608 --> 40:23.608
Yeah, what the fuck is "bereal"?

40:23.610 --> 40:26.344
Oh, shit. Look.
I meant "cereal."

40:26.346 --> 40:28.679
But that's how much
I hate crab-ass niggas.

40:28.681 --> 40:32.649
'Cause my mind, it thinks these C-words,
but my mouth won't let me say them.

40:32.651 --> 40:36.386
Okay, so, you replace words
that start with C's with B's?

40:36.388 --> 40:39.822
- Like Crip dyslexia.
- Criplexia.

40:39.824 --> 40:42.825
But only soft C's, because
you said "crab" no problem.

40:42.827 --> 40:46.395
That's true. Why won't your mind tell
your mouth to say "brab" instead of "crab"?

40:46.397 --> 40:49.898
- I don't know. It's a case-by-case thing.
- Not "base-by-base"?

40:49.900 --> 40:53.534
See, you would think this hard "C"
would be the issue, but no.

40:53.536 --> 40:55.168
That's interesting.

40:55.170 --> 40:58.337
Fuck y'all. I'm just tryin'
to rep my set. That's it.

40:58.339 --> 41:01.006
- Ladera doesn't have a set.
- What the fuck you mean?

41:01.008 --> 41:04.009
Huh?

41:04.011 --> 41:06.244
- Does that make me any less of a nigga than y'all?
- No.

41:06.246 --> 41:08.012
Because my dad was from The Bottoms.
Yeah.

41:08.014 --> 41:11.048
My uncle, everybody on my side
reppin' the Inglewood family.

41:11.050 --> 41:13.016
'Cause that's where my heart is.
Yeah.

41:13.018 --> 41:15.551
Even though my...
My body's right here.

41:15.553 --> 41:17.819
- Mm-hmm.
- It's cool.

41:17.821 --> 41:19.554
I-It's "bool."

41:21.857 --> 41:25.492
Fuck all y'all. 'Cause I was
in a good mood and shit.

41:30.029 --> 41:31.763
What was that?

41:31.765 --> 41:35.566
A song that we... You just reminded us
of something we was writing.

41:35.568 --> 41:37.701
"Was"?
Let's... Let's get to it.

41:37.703 --> 41:39.869
- What you mean?
- Let's record.

41:39.871 --> 41:42.338
- Let's record what?
- The song.

41:42.340 --> 41:45.074
Quit fucking around.
Come on.

42:01.055 --> 42:03.155
Randy.

42:15.432 --> 42:17.499
Check this out.

42:18.400 --> 42:21.402
Little niggas.
Got 'em.

42:21.404 --> 42:24.071
I know y'all hungry. If you want,
you can just help yourself to my fridge.

42:24.073 --> 42:26.306
Or I could have Marta
cook us up something.

42:26.308 --> 42:29.309
- Can she cook chili-cheese fries?
- Chili-cheese fries. Yeah.

42:29.311 --> 42:30.977
Marta! Yeah.

42:30.979 --> 42:32.812
- Right?
- Where you get 'em at?

42:32.814 --> 42:35.447
Jimmy's Burgers on Centinela
and Inglewood Avenue.

42:35.449 --> 42:39.417
Yes, um... <i>Cuatro Ã³rdenes</i>
<i>de</i> chili-cheese fries...

42:39.419 --> 42:41.786
at Jimmy's Burgers
on Centinela and Inglewood.

42:52.327 --> 42:55.329
Niggas, let's roll.
You coming, Malcolm?

42:58.733 --> 43:01.000
No, I think
I'm gonna stay here.

43:20.250 --> 43:22.284
So...

43:22.286 --> 43:25.920
you're a boy from the hood.

43:25.922 --> 43:29.523
Good thing you found the Boys Club and
have such an amazing mentor as my father.

43:36.463 --> 43:38.963
I'm bored as fuck.

43:38.965 --> 43:41.885
Will you play with me,
my little boy from the hood?

43:43.134 --> 43:44.667
Yeah.

43:44.669 --> 43:46.502
Yeah, we...

43:47.937 --> 43:50.805
I can... Well, what do
you want to play?

43:50.807 --> 43:54.208
How about we play
Mother May I?

43:54.210 --> 43:56.743
You remember that game, right?

43:57.778 --> 43:59.845
Yeah.

43:59.847 --> 44:01.847
S... Yeah.

44:01.849 --> 44:04.583
Go ahead.
Ask me a question.

44:07.787 --> 44:11.656
Um... what's your name?

44:11.658 --> 44:13.858
Lily.

44:15.126 --> 44:18.361
No, you're supposed to
ask me something like,

44:18.363 --> 44:20.696
"Mother, may I
take two steps?"

44:20.698 --> 44:23.565
If I say yes,
you take two steps toward me.

44:23.567 --> 44:27.001
Or I may say,
"No, you have to take three steps back."

44:27.003 --> 44:29.536
Now it's my turn
to ask the questions.

44:29.538 --> 44:31.037
Okay.

44:31.039 --> 44:33.539
- Got it?
- Yeah.

44:37.043 --> 44:39.324
May I take off my clothes?

44:42.681 --> 44:44.247
Yeah.

44:45.983 --> 44:47.583
Yeah.

44:54.356 --> 44:56.757
May I walk over to you?

44:59.861 --> 45:01.428
Yeah.

45:09.369 --> 45:10.802
May I touch you?

45:11.870 --> 45:13.337
Yes.

45:19.210 --> 45:21.077
Are you a virgin?

45:24.714 --> 45:26.314
No.

45:29.184 --> 45:31.285
Don't.

45:31.287 --> 45:33.787
Don't do that.

45:33.789 --> 45:38.190
There are too many liars
and bullshitters in this house, Malcolm.

45:38.192 --> 45:40.692
I can tell
you're not like that.

45:40.694 --> 45:42.293
Not like him.

45:42.295 --> 45:44.461
Don't start now, okay?

45:45.696 --> 45:47.730
Okay.

45:47.732 --> 45:49.598
Yes, I'm a virgin.

45:51.734 --> 45:53.167
I gotta pee.

45:54.235 --> 45:56.435
Jaleel keeps rubbers over there.

45:59.539 --> 46:02.140
I want you ready
when I get back.

46:14.119 --> 46:15.953
Go.

46:17.755 --> 46:20.556
Can we get some
chili-cheese fries?

46:20.558 --> 46:23.258
Burgers too.
All right, we'll get, uh...

46:23.260 --> 46:25.393
Yo, can I get
a grilled cheese?

46:25.395 --> 46:27.327
What the fuck is this?

46:29.997 --> 46:31.831
We got a problem, blood?

46:34.134 --> 46:37.202
Listen to this motherfuckin'
Abercrombie and Fitch-ass nigga.

46:38.904 --> 46:41.639
You little niggas were supposed
to deliver my lunch today.

46:41.641 --> 46:43.240
After school.

46:44.308 --> 46:46.509
Now, I need my shit.

46:46.511 --> 46:48.310
Right now, nigga.

46:48.312 --> 46:49.978
Right now.

46:49.980 --> 46:53.281
What the fuck are you even
talking about, nigga? You hungry?

46:53.283 --> 46:55.950
She's right there.
Order some shit.

46:55.952 --> 46:59.186
Order some shit?
See, first of all, you do not know me, bro.

47:00.588 --> 47:03.189
Let me tell you what's going down.
All right?

47:03.191 --> 47:05.357
We're gon' order our food.

47:05.359 --> 47:09.427
And then you can order your lunch
or whatever the fuck else.

47:09.429 --> 47:12.749
A'ight?
Then we gon' keep it pushin'.

47:17.101 --> 47:19.402
Where is my bag?

47:26.909 --> 47:29.210
- Yo.
- What's in the backpack?

47:29.212 --> 47:30.477
That's for my dad, right?

47:31.712 --> 47:32.945
Fuck.

47:34.314 --> 47:35.881
Lily.

47:37.216 --> 47:38.782
Lily.

47:41.318 --> 47:43.184
Lily?

47:45.220 --> 47:47.454
What the fuck?
What are you doing?

47:48.789 --> 47:51.891
Look...
You don't know what you...

47:51.893 --> 47:54.159
This is your...
Oh, my God!

47:54.161 --> 47:57.395
This can't even be happening.
Look... Look at you.

47:57.397 --> 48:00.131
Come on...
What is wrong with you?

48:00.133 --> 48:04.134
Have you ever fucked on Molly?
I haven't fucked on anything. Remember?

48:05.236 --> 48:08.471
Okay.

48:08.473 --> 48:10.872
Okay. All right.

48:15.311 --> 48:18.345
What the fuck!

48:18.347 --> 48:21.681
You... You threw up on me!

48:21.683 --> 48:24.250
It's everywhere!
It's all in my mouth!

48:25.686 --> 48:28.653
Who the fuck is this?

48:28.655 --> 48:32.123
Son of a...
Why are you yelling at me?

48:32.125 --> 48:34.425
I don't know you,
Mr. Bailey,

48:34.427 --> 48:36.326
but you're being very rude.

48:36.328 --> 48:37.927
What the fuck!
Bye.

48:37.929 --> 48:41.497
Yes, this is Malcolm.
Malcolm! Come here.

48:44.601 --> 48:46.702
Yes, can I reschedule,
please?

48:46.704 --> 48:48.737
Mr. Bailey, come on...

48:53.708 --> 48:55.875
Fuck!

49:01.180 --> 49:03.447
Wait. Wait.

49:03.449 --> 49:05.882
I have to go. I have to go.
Wait. We're not done yet.

49:05.884 --> 49:07.884
Where are you going?
Stop being so mean. I have to go.

49:07.886 --> 49:09.886
I spaced on
my college interviews!

49:09.888 --> 49:11.988
I spaced on
my college interviews.

49:11.990 --> 49:15.257
I only have 20 minutes to get down
there or my whole life is fucked.

49:17.460 --> 49:19.093
I'll take you.

49:20.028 --> 49:21.495
What?

49:21.497 --> 49:23.530
I'll take you.

49:31.305 --> 49:35.339
- Whee!
- Lily! Lily, get up!

49:35.341 --> 49:38.675
Oh, Lily! It's a stop sign!
Lily, stop. Stop!

49:38.677 --> 49:41.744
Stop!

49:54.888 --> 49:56.722
Oh, shit.

49:56.724 --> 49:59.024
Oh, shit.

50:06.230 --> 50:07.597
Lily.

50:08.865 --> 50:10.699
Lily!

50:10.701 --> 50:12.821
Lily!
I gotta pee! I gotta pee!

50:14.069 --> 50:16.703
Get out of my house!
Let me use the toilet!

50:16.705 --> 50:18.738
Lily! Get back!

50:18.740 --> 50:21.774
- Lily!
- I gotta pee! I gotta pee! I gotta pee!

50:25.079 --> 50:29.581
I gotta pee! I gotta pee!
I gotta pee! I gotta pee!

50:57.137 --> 50:59.037
What the fuck?

51:08.814 --> 51:12.115
Tell you what's going down.
We gon' order our food.

51:12.117 --> 51:16.152
And then you can order your
lunch or whatever the fuck else.

51:16.154 --> 51:17.887
A'ight?
Then we gon' keep it pushin'.

51:17.889 --> 51:19.622
Yeah?

51:23.260 --> 51:25.460
Shut your fuckin'...

51:37.137 --> 51:38.904
Diggy, fries, fries, fries!

51:43.775 --> 51:47.043
I want my motherfucking dope!
I want my fucking dope!

51:49.246 --> 51:51.981
Shit, where the fuck is Jaleel?

51:51.983 --> 51:54.343
Fuck!
That was our ride. What the f...

51:55.817 --> 51:58.251
Run, run, run!

51:58.253 --> 52:01.853
Freeze! Down on your knees!
Keep your hands up!

52:05.858 --> 52:07.924
What the fuck?

52:19.468 --> 52:22.668
Mr. Jacoby's just wrapping up a staff meeting.
He'll be a few minutes.

52:51.231 --> 52:52.931
Dom?

52:56.168 --> 52:58.602
Is that... Is that Dom?

53:08.011 --> 53:09.878
Oh, shit.

53:09.880 --> 53:12.513
Austin Jacoby.

53:12.515 --> 53:14.882
Nice to meet you,
Malcolm.

53:14.884 --> 53:17.484
Take a seat.
Come on, relax.

53:20.588 --> 53:23.923
So, uh...
Malcolm Adekanbi.

53:23.925 --> 53:25.958
Did I pronounce that right?

53:27.226 --> 53:28.726
Yeah? Great.

53:29.694 --> 53:31.895
You're Nigerian.

53:31.897 --> 53:34.697
My dad, um...

53:34.699 --> 53:38.400
He... He went back to Nigeria
before I was born.

53:38.402 --> 53:40.735
Sorry to hear that.

53:40.737 --> 53:43.404
I know what it's like
to grow up without a father.

53:43.406 --> 53:46.940
That's why I spend a lot of time and
a lot of money with the Boys Club.

53:46.942 --> 53:50.108
Those, um...
Those kids...

53:51.276 --> 53:53.809
A-Are they your kids?
Yes, they are.

53:55.111 --> 53:57.745
Not too much older than you.

53:57.747 --> 53:59.346
So you know Dominique?

53:59.348 --> 54:00.780
Excuse me?

54:00.782 --> 54:04.250
You... You probably
know him as Dom.

54:04.252 --> 54:07.886
No. Sorry.
Why do you ask?

54:07.888 --> 54:10.755
Dom gave me something...

54:10.757 --> 54:13.824
to deliver to someone.

54:15.293 --> 54:17.927
As crazy as it seems,

54:17.929 --> 54:21.196
I-I think
that someone is you.

54:21.198 --> 54:23.598
This Dom person...

54:23.600 --> 54:26.801
What did he say that, uh,

54:26.803 --> 54:30.070
I should have to do
with this, uh, delivery?

54:30.072 --> 54:31.905
I don't know.

54:31.907 --> 54:35.641
I just know that he told me
to deliver it to A.J., so...

54:35.643 --> 54:37.576
And why did you do it?

54:37.578 --> 54:41.146
- I didn't have a choice.
- Oh, come on, Malcolm.

54:41.148 --> 54:43.414
Come on.
You always have a choice.

54:43.416 --> 54:46.583
You could have done
a lot of things with that package.

54:46.585 --> 54:49.252
You're a smart kid.
I'm sure you thought about all of them.

54:49.254 --> 54:53.756
But you chose to make the delivery
for this Dom person...

54:55.358 --> 54:57.559
because you thought it was,
what, in your best interest?

55:01.529 --> 55:04.664
So, you should
take responsibility...

55:04.666 --> 55:07.266
for the choice
that you've made.

55:07.268 --> 55:10.335
Now, you know
I'm not the person or persons...

55:10.337 --> 55:12.103
for whom this delivery
was intended.

55:12.105 --> 55:13.838
Something happened
along the way.

55:13.840 --> 55:16.707
It's like, uh, Amazon.

55:16.709 --> 55:21.277
If you order a Rick Ross
or Macklemore CD...

55:21.279 --> 55:24.680
I would not order
a Macklemore CD.

55:24.682 --> 55:26.415
That wouldn't happen.

55:26.417 --> 55:28.750
All right. Who, then?

55:28.752 --> 55:30.685
Casey Veggies.

55:30.687 --> 55:33.487
Casey Veggies?
That's... That's an artist?

55:34.555 --> 55:36.756
Yeah.
Yeah, okay. All right.

55:36.758 --> 55:41.293
So, you order a Casey Veggies CD
from Amazon, right?

55:41.295 --> 55:45.296
No, you don't order
a Casey Veggies CD.

55:45.298 --> 55:47.564
You just go online
and you download it.

55:47.566 --> 55:49.599
Yeah, okay. All right.

55:49.601 --> 55:53.703
But you are aware
that Amazon does ship discs, right?

55:53.705 --> 55:57.106
And if you order that disc
and it does not come in a timely fashion,

55:57.108 --> 55:59.475
you're gonna call them
and say, "Where's my stuff?"

55:59.477 --> 56:01.643
And Amazon has to
assume responsibility.

56:01.645 --> 56:03.745
But it's just one CD.

56:03.747 --> 56:08.382
But what if it's 100 orders
and 100 CDs don't show up?

56:08.384 --> 56:10.650
Or a thousand?
Or 10,000?

56:11.385 --> 56:13.252
It's a slippery slope.

56:13.254 --> 56:15.053
Slippery slope.

56:15.055 --> 56:18.322
So, Amazon has got to assume...

56:18.324 --> 56:20.991
the full cost of the loss.

56:20.993 --> 56:23.059
But most importantly,

56:23.061 --> 56:26.395
they have to deal with the loss
of their reputation.

56:26.397 --> 56:29.331
A reputation that has taken
a long time to build.

56:29.333 --> 56:31.199
You understand what I'm saying?

56:32.668 --> 56:34.335
So let's do this.

56:34.337 --> 56:37.070
Let's reschedule
this interview...

56:38.439 --> 56:41.140
for a few weeks from now.

56:41.142 --> 56:42.674
Give it a little time.

56:42.676 --> 56:44.776
Go out there.

56:44.778 --> 56:47.645
Make the delivery for which you have
claimed responsibility...

56:47.647 --> 56:50.014
to the appropriate consumers...

56:50.016 --> 56:53.483
so that the suppliers
of this product...

56:53.485 --> 56:55.184
can be whole.

56:55.186 --> 56:58.086
Metaphorically speaking,
of course.

56:58.088 --> 57:00.088
If you're able to do this,

57:00.090 --> 57:02.623
it shows me more about you...

57:02.625 --> 57:05.359
than any interview ever could.

57:05.361 --> 57:08.428
And I would then
make it my business...

57:08.430 --> 57:11.931
to make you
a man of Harvard.

57:11.933 --> 57:17.202
<i>I want you to get out of
The Bottoms just like I did.</i>

57:17.204 --> 57:20.438
<i>I know from growing up there
it's very, very dangerous...</i>

57:20.440 --> 57:24.141
<i>and that your family or your
friends could get killed at any moment...</i>

57:24.143 --> 57:27.343
<i>just by being in the wrong
place at the wrong time.</i>

57:28.778 --> 57:31.179
I'd hate for that
to happen to you...

57:32.948 --> 57:35.182
<i>or any
of your family members.</i>

57:35.184 --> 57:36.416
Getting on?

57:40.220 --> 57:43.789
Looks like you and I
had the same kind of day.

57:43.791 --> 57:45.257
How'd the interview go?

57:46.859 --> 57:49.126
Okay.

57:49.128 --> 57:51.628
Well, sit down.

57:51.630 --> 57:54.096
My shift's almost over.
I'll take you home.

57:55.531 --> 57:57.899
Thanks, Mom.

59:20.700 --> 59:23.702
<i>The incident took place today
at Seven Bucks Coffee...</i>

59:23.704 --> 59:29.073
<i>Apparently the side effects of the
popular club drug MDMA, or "Molly."</i>

59:29.075 --> 59:32.042
<i>Tannehill James was a witness
to this bizarre scene.</i>

59:32.044 --> 59:35.978
<i>So, I'm here at the Seven Bucks,
drinking my vanilla chai latte...</i>

59:35.980 --> 59:39.247
<i>and eating me
some pound cake.</i>

59:39.249 --> 59:41.782
<i>'Cause you know niggas
don't eat scones, right?</i>

59:41.784 --> 59:46.086
<i>When all of a sudden
this crazy little naked ho comes up...</i>

59:46.088 --> 59:49.122
<i>and she squatted down right in front of me
and she pissed right there.</i>

59:49.124 --> 59:50.623
<i>I swear to God.</i>

59:50.625 --> 59:53.225
<i>Pissed right there
for a long time.</i>

59:53.227 --> 59:57.561
<i>So, now, you tell me how am
I supposed to eat my pound cake...</i>

59:57.563 --> 59:59.262
<i>after witnessing
something like that?</i>

59:59.264 --> 01:00:03.599
<i>Reporting live, Karen Myetta,
Channel 10 News.</i>

01:00:03.601 --> 01:00:06.802
<i>Up next, a fight over lunch
turns deadly in Inglewood.</i>

01:00:06.804 --> 01:00:09.671
Did he actually say, "I'll kill you and your
friends if you don't sell these drugs"?

01:00:09.673 --> 01:00:11.806
Or just you? What?

01:00:11.808 --> 01:00:15.643
Don't act like you weren't curious too.
Not directly.

01:00:15.645 --> 01:00:19.480
He was talking about Amazon and Rick Ross
CDs not getting to their customers.

01:00:19.482 --> 01:00:21.181
Niggas don't even buy
CDs anymore, dawg.

01:00:21.183 --> 01:00:23.316
Jib, that's not
the fucking point!

01:00:23.318 --> 01:00:26.352
Are you gonna go and sell on the corner?
'Cause we're a bunch of bitches, man.

01:00:26.354 --> 01:00:28.487
Speak for yourself, Jib.
Yes.

01:00:28.489 --> 01:00:31.423
I am a bitch-ass nigga.
I don't give a fuck.
I own that shit.

01:00:31.425 --> 01:00:33.491
Who are you trying
to impress, Diggy?

01:00:33.493 --> 01:00:35.926
We're talking about Molly, Jib,
not fucking heroin.

01:00:35.928 --> 01:00:38.962
All we gotta do
is find the white people.

01:00:38.964 --> 01:00:42.298
- Go to Coachella, Lollapalooza.
- Yeah, yeah.

01:00:42.300 --> 01:00:46.001
We can backpack and hitchhike and sing Mumford
and Sons songs and all that faux fucking shit.

01:00:46.003 --> 01:00:48.770
Fuck you. Okay?
I'm just saying it could work.

01:00:48.772 --> 01:00:51.305
Yeah, yeah.
Why stop there, you know?
Why not hit Bonnaroo also?

01:00:51.307 --> 01:00:52.572
Bitcoins.

01:00:53.774 --> 01:00:55.373
That's how we do it.
Do what?

01:00:57.709 --> 01:00:59.943
Oh, shit.

01:00:59.945 --> 01:01:02.879
There's these sites where you can...
you can sell everything...

01:01:02.881 --> 01:01:05.982
from fake credit cards
to illegal guns and drugs.

01:01:05.984 --> 01:01:08.651
And they use Bitcoins
so they can't be traced.

01:01:08.653 --> 01:01:10.519
We don't have to
stand on any corner.

01:01:11.621 --> 01:01:13.788
Dark Web. Could work.

01:01:13.790 --> 01:01:15.790
Way better than Coachella.

01:01:15.792 --> 01:01:19.059
Guys, the FBI can track us. The police...
No, they can't.

01:01:19.061 --> 01:01:21.628
- Not if you use a Tor browser.
- What the fuck is that?

01:01:21.630 --> 01:01:24.864
- Onion routing.
- Layered encryptions.

01:01:24.866 --> 01:01:27.233
It's like a game of Whac-A-Mole with
thousands of computers...

01:01:27.235 --> 01:01:29.702
What the fuck
is a Whac-A-Mole?

01:01:29.704 --> 01:01:32.538
Look, these dark Web sites
run off these secret IP addresses.

01:01:32.540 --> 01:01:34.540
Like LulzSec-level shady.

01:01:34.542 --> 01:01:36.108
We need to find one somehow.

01:01:37.376 --> 01:01:39.210
W...

01:01:41.514 --> 01:01:44.381
<i>William Ian Sherwood III.</i>

01:01:44.383 --> 01:01:48.718
<i>Musician, scholar, rake, entrepreneur,
conspiracy theorist.</i>

01:01:58.161 --> 01:02:02.329
<i>Malcolm, Jib and Diggy met William
at band camp three years ago.</i>

01:02:02.331 --> 01:02:07.533
Yo, if you niggas need some weed, I got you.
Good shit. Fair prices.

01:02:07.535 --> 01:02:09.368
<i>William assured them that
he used the word "nigga"...</i>

01:02:09.370 --> 01:02:11.169
<i>only as a term of endearment...</i>

01:02:11.171 --> 01:02:14.305
<i>as explained by Q-Tip
in the classic song, "Sucka Nigga."</i>

01:02:17.108 --> 01:02:18.842
That's your room right there.

01:02:18.844 --> 01:02:21.211
<i>After that,
they all hit it off.</i>

01:02:21.213 --> 01:02:24.280
<i>Though he never used that word
in front of them again.</i>

01:02:24.282 --> 01:02:27.016
<i>The mission at band camp was to
give kids from different backgrounds...</i>

01:02:27.018 --> 01:02:30.452
<i>a chance to exchange music and
experiences unique to their cultures.</i>

01:02:30.454 --> 01:02:34.755
W-W-Wait. Okay, so
you're saying white girls will suck dick...

01:02:34.757 --> 01:02:36.890
yet still claim they're virgins?

01:02:36.892 --> 01:02:40.460
Yeah, man. I'm serious.
Really?

01:02:40.462 --> 01:02:43.095
Dude, check it. I've been getting
head since I was, like, 12, all right?

01:02:43.097 --> 01:02:46.431
I've been hitting hos in the ass
since I was, like, 14.

01:02:46.433 --> 01:02:48.599
It's true, man.

01:02:48.601 --> 01:02:52.602
These chicks will let you fill any hole,
except the pussy,

01:02:52.604 --> 01:02:54.604
with a dick, no problem.

01:02:56.306 --> 01:02:58.040
So, technically,
you're still a virgin too.

01:02:59.909 --> 01:03:02.043
- Yeah.
- Right.

01:03:02.045 --> 01:03:05.646
But here's something
to wrap your brain around, man.

01:03:05.648 --> 01:03:08.315
I've never had intercourse
with a pussy.

01:03:08.317 --> 01:03:11.784
Mm-hmm?
Only asshole and oral. Okay?

01:03:13.186 --> 01:03:16.588
So the question isn't,
"Am I technically a virgin?"

01:03:16.590 --> 01:03:19.357
What the question could be is...

01:03:19.359 --> 01:03:22.826
"Am I technically... gay?"

01:03:23.661 --> 01:03:26.396
Oh. That's deep, nigga.

01:03:26.398 --> 01:03:29.298
Yeah. I don't know.

01:03:30.867 --> 01:03:33.335
<i>William went to...
Prep school,</i>

01:03:33.337 --> 01:03:36.037
<i>where he smoked a pound of weed a week,
skipped classes...</i>

01:03:36.039 --> 01:03:38.272
<i>and had a 1.9 GPA,</i>

01:03:38.274 --> 01:03:40.941
<i>yet got a perfect score
on his SAT.</i>

01:03:40.943 --> 01:03:44.344
<i>He was accepted to his father's
alma mater under academic probation,</i>

01:03:44.346 --> 01:03:48.581
<i>which meant he had to maintain
a 3.0 grade point average.</i>

01:03:48.583 --> 01:03:51.450
<i>So, William hacked into
the... database,</i>

01:03:51.452 --> 01:03:54.953
<i>erasing all grades
from the entire freshman class.</i>

01:03:58.425 --> 01:04:01.125
Small-batch, craft-brewed,
40-ounce malt liquor.

01:04:10.968 --> 01:04:14.436
<i>That same year, he achieved
his dream of having sex with a black girl.</i>

01:04:14.438 --> 01:04:16.137
You ever fucked on Molly before?

01:04:16.139 --> 01:04:18.205
No.

01:04:18.207 --> 01:04:19.806
Hey, nah, it's good, man.

01:04:19.808 --> 01:04:24.110
It's like... It's like
being fucked by God.

01:04:28.749 --> 01:04:31.950
Everybody is going to Black Market
Reloaded and a bunch of smaller sites.

01:04:31.952 --> 01:04:34.652
But, dude, that shit
is getting mad sketchy now.

01:04:34.654 --> 01:04:36.320
If you nigga...

01:04:37.588 --> 01:04:39.956
If you <i> guys</i> want drugs,

01:04:39.958 --> 01:04:43.059
I can get you good shit
way less expensive than online.

01:04:43.061 --> 01:04:45.661
Nigga, we don't need
to buy anything.

01:04:45.663 --> 01:04:48.597
We need to set up
a store to sell.

01:04:48.599 --> 01:04:51.399
Wha... Nah, really, dude.
What can I get you, man?

01:04:51.401 --> 01:04:54.101
I'm dead-ass serious,
nigga.

01:04:54.103 --> 01:04:55.769
Dead-ass serious.

01:04:55.771 --> 01:04:57.771
Okay.

01:04:57.773 --> 01:05:00.340
Okay.
All right. Wait.

01:05:00.342 --> 01:05:03.343
'Cause this is ridiculous, man.

01:05:03.345 --> 01:05:06.679
Why the fuck,
after all these years,

01:05:06.681 --> 01:05:10.615
you can call me N-word
and I can't say it?

01:05:10.617 --> 01:05:12.683
Yo, look, we already
went over this.

01:05:12.685 --> 01:05:15.686
I'll have to slap the shit out of you again.
I don't want to do that.

01:05:15.688 --> 01:05:18.755
See, that's not even right.
I mean, like, really.

01:05:18.757 --> 01:05:21.524
You know I'm not the one, all right?
This is all love here.

01:05:21.526 --> 01:05:23.692
Look, let's...
Let's get back...

01:05:23.694 --> 01:05:25.293
Hey, you asked me
to do something for you.

01:05:25.295 --> 01:05:27.662
I'm like, "What?" I'm down.
I don't give a fuck.

01:05:27.664 --> 01:05:31.966
Because you're my people,
all right? You're my n...

01:05:31.968 --> 01:05:33.500
And this is where
I would insert that word.

01:05:33.502 --> 01:05:35.168
It's nothing personal.
You're still my nigga.

01:05:35.170 --> 01:05:37.436
But I gotta slap the shit
out of you based on principle.

01:05:37.438 --> 01:05:40.605
- Let's get back to what's goin' on.
- No, no, no. Wait. Principle?

01:05:40.607 --> 01:05:43.474
Okay, you want to talk principle.
What about Jib here, man?

01:05:43.476 --> 01:05:45.142
This dude isn't
African-American.

01:05:45.144 --> 01:05:47.777
He's like fucking Latino
or Moroccan or some shit.

01:05:47.779 --> 01:05:49.044
Where's this conversation going?

01:05:49.046 --> 01:05:50.979
Technically, he shouldn't
be able to say the word.

01:05:50.981 --> 01:05:52.981
- Why can he use it?
- Okay. Because I'm 14% African.

01:05:52.983 --> 01:05:55.016
Four... Fourteen?
That doesn't...

01:05:55.018 --> 01:05:56.684
Shit, I'm probably 14%.

01:05:56.686 --> 01:05:59.053
I am 14% African.
Ancestry.com.

01:05:59.055 --> 01:06:01.021
Look, we don't give a fuck.

01:06:01.023 --> 01:06:03.723
- For real?
- Just say the damn word, okay?

01:06:03.725 --> 01:06:06.225
- It doesn't matter. It's cool, right?
- I don't give a shit.

01:06:06.227 --> 01:06:09.061
I give a fuck. Don't say that shit.
I will slap the shit out of you.

01:06:09.063 --> 01:06:12.397
No, no, no. No, you won't because
you have been outvoted by your peers.

01:06:12.399 --> 01:06:14.699
I'm George W. Bush.
I don't give a fuck what the vote says.

01:06:14.701 --> 01:06:16.381
Dig.
What the fuck?

01:06:17.735 --> 01:06:20.203
Let him say it.

01:06:21.371 --> 01:06:25.140
- All right, you can say it.
- Thank you.

01:06:25.142 --> 01:06:27.542
And I appreciate that.
I really do.

01:06:27.544 --> 01:06:29.544
Now, like a nigga was saying...

01:06:29.546 --> 01:06:31.145
What the fuck!

01:06:31.147 --> 01:06:33.180
What the fuck?

01:06:33.182 --> 01:06:35.582
What the fuck?
Yo, it was a reflex.

01:06:35.584 --> 01:06:37.550
- Reflex? A fuckin' reflex?
- Dig!

01:06:37.552 --> 01:06:39.351
It won't happen again.
I'm sorry.

01:06:39.353 --> 01:06:43.087
Look. Will,
we need your help to sell this shit.

01:06:43.089 --> 01:06:45.055
That's why we're here.

01:06:45.057 --> 01:06:48.324
- Whoa. How did you guys get this?
- It's a long story, man.

01:06:48.326 --> 01:06:50.526
We need to know
if you're gonna help us.

01:06:51.861 --> 01:06:54.662
Why? I mean, you guys
could set that type of shit up easily.

01:06:54.664 --> 01:06:56.697
Nah, nigga,
not like you. Okay?

01:06:56.699 --> 01:06:59.599
I need to go ghost.
None of this shit can point back to me.

01:06:59.601 --> 01:07:02.868
The type of protection
I need for this shit requires a hacker.

01:07:02.870 --> 01:07:05.003
Anon shit.

01:07:05.005 --> 01:07:07.405
You broke into
the fucking USC database.

01:07:07.407 --> 01:07:09.340
Hey, hey. No, no, no. Okay?

01:07:09.342 --> 01:07:11.375
Samo did that.
I don't know shit, all right?

01:07:11.377 --> 01:07:13.110
Whatever, nigga.

01:07:13.112 --> 01:07:15.078
Look, we don't know shit
about selling dope.

01:07:15.080 --> 01:07:16.712
Nothing.

01:07:16.714 --> 01:07:18.780
Nothing about the units,
the terminology, the pricing.

01:07:18.782 --> 01:07:21.382
None of that shit. I don't even know
how much this fucking bag is worth.

01:07:21.384 --> 01:07:23.517
You do.

01:07:23.519 --> 01:07:25.385
Okay.

01:07:25.387 --> 01:07:29.222
But if this is
a Samo-type job,

01:07:29.224 --> 01:07:31.624
man, I can't just
do this as a favor.

01:07:31.626 --> 01:07:33.425
What do you want?
A percentage of the profits?

01:07:33.427 --> 01:07:35.427
Fuck that.

01:07:35.429 --> 01:07:37.095
Pay me in Molly.

01:07:38.965 --> 01:07:41.565
Cut up the shit. You're gonna want to
measure it out...

01:07:41.567 --> 01:07:44.134
so you can bag it up in grams,
sell it that way.

01:07:44.136 --> 01:07:48.905
But, you know, what a lot of the kids
are liking nowadays is the pill form.

01:07:54.779 --> 01:07:57.179
So, where we setting up shop?

01:07:58.781 --> 01:08:00.648
Here.

01:08:00.650 --> 01:08:03.550
Here?
Yeah. Here.

01:08:03.552 --> 01:08:05.285
Are you fuckin' retarded?

01:08:05.287 --> 01:08:07.987
No. It's actually
genius, bro.

01:08:07.989 --> 01:08:09.588
<i>We have a science lab.</i>

01:08:09.590 --> 01:08:11.656
We want to enter
the Google Science Fair.

01:08:11.658 --> 01:08:13.658
All we need you to do
is open up the science labs,

01:08:13.660 --> 01:08:16.100
and we can do everything else.

01:08:18.729 --> 01:08:20.595
Don't lose that shit,
okay?

01:08:20.598 --> 01:08:23.331
<i>We have a computer lab
which nobody ever uses.</i>

01:08:28.504 --> 01:08:31.805
<i>And all the supplies laying around the
band room would be perfect for shipping.</i>

01:08:36.344 --> 01:08:37.975
And the best part...
Watch.

01:08:49.020 --> 01:08:52.154
Nobody's going to suspect a thing.
We're just geeks doing what geeks do.

01:08:54.024 --> 01:08:56.457
Right? That's what I'm saying, bro.
You're into it, bro.

01:09:00.794 --> 01:09:02.327
<i>What's up?</i>

01:09:02.328 --> 01:09:03.995
Yo.
What's up?

01:09:03.997 --> 01:09:06.363
<i>Hey, congratulations
on getting the store set up.</i>

01:09:06.366 --> 01:09:09.200
<i>Now, uh, we gotta get you guys
some customers, right?</i>

01:09:09.202 --> 01:09:11.035
- Yeah.
- <i>Check it out.</i>

01:09:11.037 --> 01:09:13.170
<i>My house is having a party.</i>

01:09:13.171 --> 01:09:15.939
<i>We could use a cool band.</i>

01:09:18.609 --> 01:09:22.845
Okay. Say we're, like... What about
if you're quoting, like, rap lyrics?

01:09:22.846 --> 01:09:25.214
Say we're all listening
to <i> The Chronic, Doggystyle.</i>

01:09:25.216 --> 01:09:28.456
We're all rapping along.
Like, what are we supposed to say?

01:09:30.854 --> 01:09:32.953
I'm sorry.
That's bullshit, dude. Yes.

01:09:32.956 --> 01:09:36.323
- What about the artist's intent?
- Dude, that is exactly what I'm talking about, man.

01:09:36.326 --> 01:09:38.693
Dude, I saw your bitch, Lily,
on YouTube.

01:09:38.694 --> 01:09:43.162
Okay. Well, Lily is not
my bitch anymore, so...

01:09:43.165 --> 01:09:45.665
Then can I get at her, dude?
'Cause I gotta find out what she was on.

01:09:45.667 --> 01:09:48.167
Nigga, I don't give a fuck.
All right?

01:09:48.169 --> 01:09:54.038
Go for it, dude.
Hey, but for real, she was using this.

01:09:57.243 --> 01:10:00.978
Um... Mike check.
One, two. One, two.

01:10:00.980 --> 01:10:02.746
Um, hi.

01:10:02.748 --> 01:10:05.014
I'm Malcolm Ad-Rock
on guitar.

01:10:05.016 --> 01:10:09.018
We've got diggity
Diggy Dawson on the drums,

01:10:09.020 --> 01:10:12.988
and we've got steel-faced bobblehead Jibby
right here on the bass.

01:10:12.990 --> 01:10:14.923
Play something, Fresh Prince!

01:10:14.925 --> 01:10:18.493
All right.
We are Awreeoh.

01:10:18.495 --> 01:10:22.262
We're about to turn it up, okay?
One, two.

01:10:22.264 --> 01:10:24.563
One, two, three, four.

01:10:52.788 --> 01:10:55.988
What the fuck?

01:11:54.068 --> 01:11:56.902
<i>Diggy, Diggy, Diggy!</i>

01:12:02.775 --> 01:12:06.243
<i>Yo, fuck Molly, dawg!
It's all about that Lily, son!</i>

01:12:06.245 --> 01:12:08.578
<i>How am I supposed
to eat my p-p-p...</i>

01:12:08.580 --> 01:12:09.879
<i>Pound cake?</i>

01:12:09.881 --> 01:12:11.614
<i>Eat my pound cake.</i>

01:12:11.616 --> 01:12:13.582
<i>My pound cake!</i>

01:12:15.918 --> 01:12:18.753
<i>Is this Channel 10?
You're all out here, huh?</i>

01:12:18.755 --> 01:12:20.921
<i>Hey, homey, videotape this.</i>

01:12:20.923 --> 01:12:23.204
<i>I want to tweet
this later, man.</i>

01:12:26.193 --> 01:12:28.793
Son of a bitch.

01:12:32.896 --> 01:12:34.463
"Lily"?

01:12:36.600 --> 01:12:38.967
I can't believe we're
really doing this right now.

01:12:48.443 --> 01:12:50.443
No.

01:12:57.749 --> 01:12:59.683
This shit better work, Will.

01:13:16.629 --> 01:13:18.262
Oh, shit.

01:13:33.741 --> 01:13:36.309
<i>Lily, dude,
that was unbelievable.</i>

01:13:51.658 --> 01:13:54.660
Principal Harris tells me that there are
three young men...

01:13:54.662 --> 01:13:56.862
who actually joined
the Google Science Fair.

01:13:56.864 --> 01:13:58.396
Please.

01:14:05.003 --> 01:14:07.037
Proof...

01:14:07.039 --> 01:14:10.006
that the public school system
is still a ladder...

01:14:10.008 --> 01:14:11.507
to success.

01:14:12.976 --> 01:14:15.143
Half an ounce for Joe Patterson.

01:14:15.145 --> 01:14:17.645
We have an ounce
for John Smith.

01:14:17.647 --> 01:14:20.014
We have an eighth
for Ashley Down.

01:14:20.016 --> 01:14:21.582
- Susan Thompson.
- Steve Burke.

01:14:28.622 --> 01:14:30.789
<i>Yeah, this popped up
about a few weeks ago.</i>

01:14:30.791 --> 01:14:33.992
Look at what they're moving.
It's major volume too.

01:14:33.994 --> 01:14:36.461
I don't know why
they're calling it "Lily."

01:14:36.463 --> 01:14:40.998
Maybe, uh, 2 Chainz
called it that on a mixtape.

01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:43.633
He's a rapper.
Yeah, you know, "The Birthday Song."

01:14:43.635 --> 01:14:45.801
"Big booty ho."

01:14:47.136 --> 01:14:49.176
Okay, never mind.
Forget it.

01:14:58.813 --> 01:15:00.747
Hi.

01:15:02.182 --> 01:15:06.084
Um, is that offer
still on the table?

01:15:06.086 --> 01:15:09.187
Help.

01:15:09.189 --> 01:15:11.022
If you're busy,
I can come back tomorrow or later.

01:15:11.024 --> 01:15:13.758
No, um, no. They're...
They're about to leave.

01:15:13.760 --> 01:15:16.059
Yeah.
Yeah, we were stepping.

01:15:17.394 --> 01:15:19.294
Okay, cool. Thanks.

01:15:29.938 --> 01:15:31.771
Bye. Bye, guys.
Have fun.

01:15:53.224 --> 01:15:55.123
Thanks for helping me.

01:15:55.125 --> 01:15:57.225
No problem.

01:15:57.227 --> 01:15:59.126
You're a fast learner.

01:15:59.128 --> 01:16:00.660
Aw.

01:16:03.430 --> 01:16:04.930
Thanks.

01:16:10.635 --> 01:16:13.115
Shit's been real crazy
since Dom got locked up.

01:16:15.806 --> 01:16:18.966
A few of his boys
got smoked on the corner the other day.

01:16:26.783 --> 01:16:28.903
I don't want
to go back there.

01:16:36.591 --> 01:16:39.159
Sorry. I just don't have people
I can talk to about this stuff...

01:16:39.161 --> 01:16:41.442
that understand, you know?

01:16:42.396 --> 01:16:44.163
I know.

01:16:45.565 --> 01:16:47.032
Thanks.

01:16:53.138 --> 01:16:55.458
Dom called from jail
the other day.

01:16:57.507 --> 01:16:59.374
He asked about you.

01:17:04.146 --> 01:17:08.048
That's why you showed up
all of a sudden.

01:17:09.116 --> 01:17:10.783
What's that supposed to mean?

01:17:10.785 --> 01:17:13.552
It means that Dom sent you here
as his messenger.

01:17:15.154 --> 01:17:17.988
All this crying on my shoulder?
Bullshit.

01:17:19.523 --> 01:17:22.091
You're supposed
to put your feminine wiles on me...

01:17:22.093 --> 01:17:23.926
and find out
about the fucking dope.

01:17:23.928 --> 01:17:25.894
Right?

01:17:26.428 --> 01:17:27.895
Right?

01:17:37.771 --> 01:17:39.772
Wait. I...

01:17:39.774 --> 01:17:42.007
And here I was, stupid enough to think
that you were different...

01:17:42.009 --> 01:17:44.175
than these other niggas.

01:17:44.177 --> 01:17:45.676
Nakia, Nakia, Nakia.

01:17:45.678 --> 01:17:47.177
Fuck you!

01:17:57.855 --> 01:18:00.289
"Feminine wiles"?

01:18:00.291 --> 01:18:03.058
Good morning.
Today you're going to take the SAT.

01:18:03.060 --> 01:18:06.227
The SAT is your chance to show
how prepared you are for college.

01:18:06.229 --> 01:18:09.863
You will have 25 minutes
to work on section one.

01:18:09.865 --> 01:18:13.466
Yo, what the fuck was that?

01:18:13.468 --> 01:18:15.568
What do you mean,
you don't know?

01:18:15.570 --> 01:18:17.469
Drug search, dawg.

01:18:17.471 --> 01:18:19.904
They do it randomly,
like, every month or so.

01:18:19.906 --> 01:18:22.039
It's all for show. I mean,
it's not like somebody is stupid enough...

01:18:22.041 --> 01:18:24.601
to put some shit
in their locker.

01:18:25.242 --> 01:18:27.076
Can I go to the bathroom?

01:18:27.078 --> 01:18:29.344
Yes, but you will not
be given more time.

01:19:02.672 --> 01:19:04.739
Man.
Come on, man.

01:19:04.741 --> 01:19:07.008
What in the hell
are you doing?

01:19:07.010 --> 01:19:09.143
Um, SAT's.

01:19:09.145 --> 01:19:11.145
SAT's?

01:19:11.147 --> 01:19:15.114
I had to use the restroom,
and I'm kind of late getting back.

01:19:15.116 --> 01:19:16.682
You know?

01:19:18.785 --> 01:19:20.819
Thank you.
Good luck, little man.

01:19:20.821 --> 01:19:24.189
<i>Bring that beat back!
One, two, three, four!</i>

01:19:24.191 --> 01:19:26.224
<i>Here it is!
The set ain't over!</i>

01:19:26.226 --> 01:19:28.559
<i>Come on, y'all.
Let's get busy.</i>

01:19:28.561 --> 01:19:31.528
<i>Come on. Say "Yeah!"</i>

01:19:31.530 --> 01:19:34.230
<i>Say "Hell yeah!"</i>

01:19:34.232 --> 01:19:36.532
<i>- Ain't it funky?
- I'm not doing this shit no more.</i>

01:19:36.534 --> 01:19:38.333
Bro, I can fix this shit.

01:19:38.335 --> 01:19:40.702
I can fix this shit.

01:19:40.704 --> 01:19:43.004
The bag is almost done.
The shit is almost gone.

01:19:43.006 --> 01:19:46.240
I mean, I can't sell this shit no more.
We almost just got fucking caught.

01:19:46.242 --> 01:19:49.810
Look, I don't want to go to jail.
I want to go to fucking college.

01:19:49.812 --> 01:19:52.379
I want to get a good job.
I want to help my mom!

01:19:52.381 --> 01:19:53.446
Dig?

01:19:56.416 --> 01:19:58.316
That's cool.

01:19:59.584 --> 01:20:01.885
It's my fault,
my weight to carry.

01:20:01.887 --> 01:20:03.753
Yo, that's bullshit.

01:20:05.355 --> 01:20:08.389
We all wanted to go to Dom's party.
Especially you, Jib.

01:20:09.724 --> 01:20:11.391
It's our weight to carry too.

01:20:12.893 --> 01:20:14.926
We've got your back
to the end, right?

01:20:16.395 --> 01:20:17.928
Right?

01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:25.633
Fuck.

01:20:28.236 --> 01:20:29.769
Ooh.

01:20:29.771 --> 01:20:32.872
- There it is.
- <i>Gracias.</i>

01:20:32.874 --> 01:20:35.441
All right, so, when we get
the Bitcoins, then what?

01:20:35.443 --> 01:20:36.975
I need cash.

01:20:39.078 --> 01:20:41.412
Well, you would have to
do a currency exchange...

01:20:41.414 --> 01:20:44.715
to get the US dollar equivalent,
but, I mean...

01:20:44.717 --> 01:20:47.751
That kind of defeats the purpose of
a non-fiat currency, right?

01:20:47.753 --> 01:20:50.854
Okay, see, I don't give a fuck about
all that Aaron Swartz...

01:20:50.856 --> 01:20:52.789
Occupy Wall Street shit.

01:20:52.791 --> 01:20:57.226
Okay, well, you'd have to link your
Bitcoin account to a bank account,

01:20:57.228 --> 01:20:59.962
and then there's
this infinitesimally small chance...

01:20:59.964 --> 01:21:01.763
that it could be traced.

01:21:01.765 --> 01:21:04.899
I mean, the Feds would have to
know exactly what they're looking for.

01:21:04.901 --> 01:21:08.102
It's not something
they could just stumble upon randomly.

01:21:08.104 --> 01:21:13.573
Basically, I would just have to make
a stupid-ass mistake for them to trace it.

01:21:13.575 --> 01:21:17.409
And do I look like the type of nigga that
makes stupid-ass mistakes?

01:21:20.412 --> 01:21:21.645
Um...

01:21:22.947 --> 01:21:25.715
So, you want me
to set up that exchange?

01:21:25.717 --> 01:21:27.917
I'm... I'm good.
I'll do it.

01:21:27.919 --> 01:21:29.418
- Um...
- Huh?

01:21:29.420 --> 01:21:31.686
What if I want
zero chances of trace?

01:21:33.155 --> 01:21:35.256
Well...

01:21:35.258 --> 01:21:37.191
if you want zero trace,

01:21:38.593 --> 01:21:40.727
you gotta go
black market, homey.

01:21:40.729 --> 01:21:43.463
<i>Yeah, you got to put
the Bitcoins on a drive...</i>

01:21:43.465 --> 01:21:45.064
<i>and make
a hand-to-hand exchange.</i>

01:21:45.066 --> 01:21:48.734
<i>You get cash
minus the transaction fee.</i>

01:21:48.736 --> 01:21:52.437
<i>If you really want to go that route...
and I really don't suggest it...</i>

01:21:52.439 --> 01:21:54.338
<i>I know a dude
in the garment district.</i>

01:21:54.340 --> 01:21:56.239
<i>Ask for Fidel.</i>

01:21:56.241 --> 01:21:59.809
<i>If you pass his test,
he'll help you.</i>

01:22:01.011 --> 01:22:03.412
<i>If you don't...</i>

01:22:03.414 --> 01:22:06.314
<i>Well, just pass his test.</i>

01:22:06.316 --> 01:22:09.617
One of these alligator bags
was made here.

01:22:09.619 --> 01:22:11.485
One is from the store.

01:22:11.487 --> 01:22:14.354
Which one is which?

01:22:14.356 --> 01:22:16.589
The right one,
I mean, 'cause it's...

01:22:16.591 --> 01:22:18.457
Mm-hmm.
Poofier.

01:22:18.459 --> 01:22:21.059
They both look the same.

01:22:24.496 --> 01:22:26.430
The reality is...

01:22:26.432 --> 01:22:29.299
I sell 90% of my stuff
to white hos.

01:22:29.301 --> 01:22:31.834
Most are rich enough
to afford retail.

01:22:31.836 --> 01:22:33.569
Why do you think that is?

01:22:34.837 --> 01:22:36.704
I don't know.

01:22:36.706 --> 01:22:40.207
They know. They know
the only difference...

01:22:40.209 --> 01:22:42.475
between these two bags...

01:22:42.477 --> 01:22:44.176
is the person rocking them.

01:22:44.178 --> 01:22:46.378
So, when they rock 'em,

01:22:46.380 --> 01:22:48.380
people are gonna assume
it's real.

01:22:48.382 --> 01:22:51.282
And the flip of that is...

01:22:51.284 --> 01:22:54.718
it doesn't matter if you had the receipt
from Barneys sewn into the bag.

01:22:54.720 --> 01:22:58.388
People gonna assume it's fake.

01:22:58.390 --> 01:23:00.089
Only you know the truth.

01:23:02.492 --> 01:23:04.826
So, what are you, man?

01:23:04.828 --> 01:23:06.494
Are you a real?

01:23:06.496 --> 01:23:09.196
Are you a fake?

01:23:09.198 --> 01:23:11.364
That's what I need to find out.

01:23:11.366 --> 01:23:13.699
I'm just Malcolm.

01:23:13.701 --> 01:23:16.401
"Just Malcolm"?
Who the fuck is Malcolm?

01:23:16.403 --> 01:23:20.103
Show me. I want you to hit me
as hard as you can.

01:23:22.706 --> 01:23:25.507
Hey!
Don't look at them.

01:23:25.509 --> 01:23:29.410
This is between you and me.
I'm-a give you five seconds.

01:23:29.412 --> 01:23:33.480
You can either man up
or run out like the little bitch you is.

01:23:34.648 --> 01:23:37.416
- One!
- Malcolm, let's just go.

01:23:37.418 --> 01:23:39.985
Listen to your friends, boy.
Two!

01:23:39.987 --> 01:23:42.654
You can't be serious.
I'm more than serious, motherfucker.

01:23:42.656 --> 01:23:44.756
Three!
I need that money.

01:23:44.758 --> 01:23:47.592
You ain't gettin' shit.
Four!

01:23:47.594 --> 01:23:50.027
Yeah, you see
your pussy friends leaving?

01:23:50.029 --> 01:23:51.629
They're running
like some little bitches.

01:23:52.730 --> 01:23:54.530
Run, pussy.

01:23:54.532 --> 01:23:56.732
Five! Five! Five!

01:23:56.734 --> 01:23:58.433
Hit me, man!
Five, motherfuck...

01:24:11.413 --> 01:24:13.680
Oh, man. You...

01:24:23.890 --> 01:24:26.191
Drive.
Where?

01:24:26.193 --> 01:24:29.594
Give me the drive!
Shit.

01:24:47.745 --> 01:24:49.178
Come here, man.

01:24:56.318 --> 01:24:58.419
Now I know who you are...

01:24:58.421 --> 01:25:01.155
A man that
does not give a fuck.

01:25:19.404 --> 01:25:22.105
Hey, blood!
Don't you owe me another shoe, nigga?

01:25:22.107 --> 01:25:24.173
Shit!

01:25:24.175 --> 01:25:26.475
Get on the ground,
bitch-ass nigga.

01:25:26.477 --> 01:25:29.644
- Get the fuck off me!
- Malcolm!

01:25:29.646 --> 01:25:32.747
- Get off us! Malcolm!
- Stay the fuck down, nigga.

01:25:32.749 --> 01:25:35.516
- Malcolm!
- Bitch nigga. Yeah.

01:25:35.518 --> 01:25:37.951
Yeah!

01:25:37.953 --> 01:25:40.420
- Jib, get the fucking bag.
- Come on!

01:25:40.422 --> 01:25:43.221
Oh, shit.

01:25:44.957 --> 01:25:46.524
Hold on, hold on.
Hey, hold on.

01:25:48.660 --> 01:25:50.761
Give me the bag.

01:25:59.770 --> 01:26:02.538
Please,
just give me the bag.

01:26:15.816 --> 01:26:18.551
I don't even want
that shit, blood.

01:26:18.553 --> 01:26:21.787
Let's go, nigga.
All right. Come on.

01:26:21.789 --> 01:26:23.421
We out, we out, we out.

01:26:31.494 --> 01:26:33.194
It's okay.

01:26:36.364 --> 01:26:37.597
It's okay.

01:26:48.008 --> 01:26:50.009
Come on.

01:26:50.011 --> 01:26:51.443
Let's go.

01:27:30.380 --> 01:27:32.781
That's 10%.

01:27:32.783 --> 01:27:35.016
Consider it a proffer.

01:27:35.018 --> 01:27:38.719
- The rest is in a Bitcoin account.
- Bitcoin?

01:27:38.721 --> 01:27:41.689
It's an untraceable
Internet currency.

01:27:41.691 --> 01:27:44.992
There are Web sites
that sell a lot of things...

01:27:44.994 --> 01:27:47.961
that people would
get in trouble for selling.

01:27:47.963 --> 01:27:50.663
They use Bitcoins.

01:27:50.665 --> 01:27:52.531
Kind of like Amazon.

01:27:52.533 --> 01:27:54.232
So you sold on the Internet?

01:27:55.133 --> 01:27:56.600
No.

01:27:57.668 --> 01:28:00.169
No. You did.

01:28:00.171 --> 01:28:02.137
Excuse me?

01:28:02.139 --> 01:28:05.105
You set up a store
on Black Market Reloaded.

01:28:06.173 --> 01:28:07.740
Very successful.

01:28:07.742 --> 01:28:09.374
Very successful.

01:28:09.376 --> 01:28:12.810
I mean, you moved
your entire inventory.

01:28:12.812 --> 01:28:15.579
See, the market's
been pretty volatile,

01:28:15.581 --> 01:28:21.417
but as of right now,
you have $97,267 and 31 cents...

01:28:21.419 --> 01:28:24.486
in your Bitcoin
exchange account.

01:28:26.189 --> 01:28:28.522
10,000 in cash.

01:28:28.524 --> 01:28:32.092
Now, as long as your Bitcoins stay
in the exchange account,

01:28:32.094 --> 01:28:34.861
they're safe, untraceable.

01:28:34.863 --> 01:28:40.032
Now, if you were to exchange
the Bitcoins into dollars...

01:28:40.034 --> 01:28:43.802
and transfer that money into your
Jacoby Check Cashing corporate account,

01:28:45.671 --> 01:28:50.107
there would be a really, really
small chance of it getting traced...

01:28:50.109 --> 01:28:52.843
by the DEA or FBI.

01:28:52.845 --> 01:28:56.879
I mean, that would only happen if
you were idiotically sloppy...

01:28:56.881 --> 01:28:59.214
while setting up
the Bitcoin exchange account.

01:29:00.684 --> 01:29:02.283
So you want me
to set up that exchange?

01:29:02.285 --> 01:29:03.784
I'm good. I'll do it.

01:29:03.786 --> 01:29:08.121
I mean, that... I mean,
it would almost have to be...

01:29:10.257 --> 01:29:12.057
intentional.

01:29:15.727 --> 01:29:18.395
And why should I believe
any of this, Malcolm?

01:29:18.397 --> 01:29:21.197
Is your Jacoby APS
shipping account number...

01:29:21.199 --> 01:29:23.899
<i>FX4578?</i>

01:29:23.901 --> 01:29:29.070
<i>California regional
bank number 267856783?</i>

01:29:29.072 --> 01:29:31.705
Federal Tax ID 95...

01:29:31.707 --> 01:29:35.642
Hey, you really should just
upgrade your firewall, you know?

01:29:35.644 --> 01:29:38.945
I actually know a guy. He's kind of
familiar with your system already.

01:29:45.385 --> 01:29:48.620
You're all out
of toilet paper, hon.

01:29:48.622 --> 01:29:52.056
Courtside, okay? Courtside.
Gotta have it. No, come on.

01:30:00.064 --> 01:30:02.732
Now, what if I report
to the authorities...

01:30:02.734 --> 01:30:04.967
that my securities
have been breached...

01:30:04.969 --> 01:30:07.169
and my identity has been stolen?

01:30:07.171 --> 01:30:09.771
As I've just learned,

01:30:09.773 --> 01:30:11.893
it doesn't matter
if this bag is real or fake.

01:30:13.508 --> 01:30:16.576
Because of where I come from,
everybody's going to assume it's fake.

01:30:16.578 --> 01:30:18.978
So, since you and I come
from the same place,

01:30:20.480 --> 01:30:22.948
what is the DEA going
to assume about you?

01:30:22.950 --> 01:30:25.750
And because you and I
are from the same place, Malcolm,

01:30:25.752 --> 01:30:29.653
you should know what a person
like me can do to a person like you.

01:30:29.655 --> 01:30:32.088
Yeah.

01:30:32.090 --> 01:30:34.410
But that's not what
a Harvard man would do.

01:30:35.992 --> 01:30:39.194
Nah, see, a man of Harvard
is smart enough to see...

01:30:39.196 --> 01:30:41.162
that would set off
a chain of events...

01:30:41.164 --> 01:30:44.098
that would inevitably come back
and destroy him...

01:30:44.100 --> 01:30:46.733
<i>and everything he's built.</i>

01:30:47.634 --> 01:30:50.702
<i>That would be a shame.</i>

01:30:50.704 --> 01:30:54.605
So, I think you should take this
opportunity before you very seriously.

01:30:56.608 --> 01:31:00.477
Do everything in your power
to ensure that I become a man of Harvard...

01:31:00.479 --> 01:31:03.913
and make sure nothing happens
to a hair on my gorgeous head.

01:31:05.282 --> 01:31:06.715
Can you dig it?

01:31:19.894 --> 01:31:22.860
Malcolm,
you forgot your bag.

01:31:25.196 --> 01:31:26.696
It's fake.

01:31:40.642 --> 01:31:42.542
<i>Malcolm.</i>

01:31:42.544 --> 01:31:45.678
You're pretty damn arrogant.
You think you're gonna get into Harvard?

01:31:45.680 --> 01:31:48.113
<i>Who do you think you are?</i>

01:32:03.662 --> 01:32:05.462
Let me tell you
about two students.

01:32:08.532 --> 01:32:11.600
<i>Student "A" is a straight-A student
who lives in the suburbs of Los Angeles.</i>

01:32:15.537 --> 01:32:17.838
<i>He plays in a punk band
with his best friends.</i>

01:32:17.840 --> 01:32:20.941
<i>He loves to skateboard
and ride on his BMX bike.</i>

01:32:20.943 --> 01:32:25.011
<i>His favorite TV show is</i> Game Of Thrones <i>
and his favorite band is The Thermals.</i>

01:32:25.013 --> 01:32:28.180
<i>He's a '90s hip-hop geek.</i>

01:32:28.182 --> 01:32:31.216
<i>Student "B" goes
to an underfunded school...</i>

01:32:31.218 --> 01:32:33.284
<i>where teachers who would
rather not be there...</i>

01:32:33.286 --> 01:32:37.187
<i>teach kids
who really don't care.</i>

01:32:37.189 --> 01:32:40.069
<i>He lives with a single mother,
doesn't know his father and has sold dope.</i>

01:32:43.393 --> 01:32:45.293
<i>Now close your eyes.</i>

01:32:45.295 --> 01:32:48.863
<i>Picture each of these kids
and tell me what you see.</i>

01:32:48.865 --> 01:32:51.699
<i>Be honest.
No one's going to judge you.</i>

01:32:51.701 --> 01:32:53.767
<i>Now open your eyes.</i>

01:32:53.769 --> 01:32:56.035
So, am I student "A"
or student "B"?

01:32:56.037 --> 01:32:57.970
Am I a geek or a menace?

01:32:57.972 --> 01:33:00.706
For most of my life, I've been caught in
between who I really am...

01:33:00.708 --> 01:33:02.374
and how I'm perceived,

01:33:02.376 --> 01:33:04.675
in between categories
and definition.

01:33:05.977 --> 01:33:07.544
I don't fit in.

01:33:07.546 --> 01:33:10.947
And I used to think that
that was a curse, but...

01:33:10.949 --> 01:33:13.315
now I'm slowly
starting to see...

01:33:14.650 --> 01:33:16.384
maybe it's a blessing.

01:33:16.386 --> 01:33:18.319
See, when you don't fit in,

01:33:18.321 --> 01:33:21.588
you're forced to see the world from
many different angles and points of view.

01:33:21.590 --> 01:33:26.492
You gain knowledge, life lessons
from disparate people and places.

01:33:26.494 --> 01:33:29.495
And those lessons,
for better or worse, have shaped me.

01:33:29.497 --> 01:33:31.263
So, who am I?

01:33:31.265 --> 01:33:34.633
Allow me to reintroduce myself.
My name is Malcolm Adekanbi.

01:33:34.635 --> 01:33:37.602
I'm a straight-A student
with nearly perfect SAT scores.

01:33:37.604 --> 01:33:40.671
I taught myself
how to play guitar and read music.

01:33:40.673 --> 01:33:44.274
I have stellar recommendations
and diverse extracurricular activities.

01:33:44.276 --> 01:33:46.409
I am a Google Science Fair
participant,

01:33:46.411 --> 01:33:49.878
and in three weeks, I helped make
over $100,000 for an online business.

01:33:51.247 --> 01:33:53.848
So, why do I want
to attend Harvard?

01:33:55.984 --> 01:33:58.784
If I was white, would you even have to
ask me that question?

01:35:47.712 --> 01:35:50.313
Nice haircut.

01:35:51.615 --> 01:35:53.282
I like it.

01:35:58.121 --> 01:36:00.889
I'm... I'm sorry...

01:36:00.891 --> 01:36:04.792
for all the stuff that I said.

01:36:06.094 --> 01:36:10.130
There was a lot going on
at the time.

01:36:10.132 --> 01:36:13.433
And... that wasn't me.

01:36:15.803 --> 01:36:17.436
Yeah, it was.

01:36:19.739 --> 01:36:22.640
You might have all
these other folks fooled, but not me.

01:36:23.875 --> 01:36:25.375
You're...

01:36:26.877 --> 01:36:28.444
complicated.

01:36:32.682 --> 01:36:35.282
Anyway, I just came by
to say thank you.

01:36:37.351 --> 01:36:39.418
Thank you?

01:36:39.420 --> 01:36:41.486
You... You passed?
Mm-hmm.

01:36:41.488 --> 01:36:43.287
You passed.

01:36:44.656 --> 01:36:46.556
You were supposed to
go to prom with me.

01:36:46.558 --> 01:36:48.524
No.

01:36:48.526 --> 01:36:51.226
I told you I wasn't mad
about missing prom.

01:36:53.229 --> 01:36:54.796
Hey.

01:36:56.098 --> 01:36:58.899
I was mad about
missing Six Flags.

01:37:08.608 --> 01:37:11.128
I'll pick you up
in the morning.
