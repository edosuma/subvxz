WEBVTT

00:10.066 --> 00:11.400
You were huckin'
the ball around

00:11.433 --> 00:12.666
with your pals
the other day...

00:13.633 --> 00:15.266
Say, uh...

00:15.300 --> 00:17.800
What's the deal with your
sweetie there, Squirrely Dan?

00:17.833 --> 00:19.300
Well, I took her
out last night.

00:19.333 --> 00:22.166
‐Where to?
‐Outs to the chip truck.

00:22.200 --> 00:24.466
‐Fries and gravy?
‐I had mine with gravy.

00:24.500 --> 00:26.466
She had hers with
salts and malts vinegar.

00:26.500 --> 00:28.066
Do you know that
salt and malt vinegar's

00:28.100 --> 00:29.200
a non‐traditional way
to dress your French fries

00:29.233 --> 00:30.333
in the United States?

00:30.366 --> 00:31.766
What the fuck
is wrong with them?

00:31.800 --> 00:33.500
Like malt vinegar
is not a staple condiment

00:33.533 --> 00:35.600
on tabletops in restaurants
in the United States.

00:35.633 --> 00:36.700
Fuck, figure it out.

00:36.733 --> 00:38.266
That's what I say.
I say, figure it out.

00:38.300 --> 00:40.200
Got no vinegars on the tables,
no Krafts peanut butters.

00:40.233 --> 00:41.666
WAYNE: Figure it out.
DARYL: Fuckin' figure it out.

00:41.700 --> 00:43.700
Better not forget those
fuckin' all‐dressed chips.

00:43.733 --> 00:45.566
No ketchup chips neither.

00:45.600 --> 00:47.333
WAYNE: Figure it out.

00:47.366 --> 00:48.800
Somebody really
ought to write a letter.

00:48.833 --> 00:51.333
They do got six different
types of Cap'n Crunch, though.

00:51.366 --> 00:52.566
How do you know that?

00:52.600 --> 00:55.033
Saw a comedian talks about it
on the <i>Juste Pour Rires.</i>

00:55.066 --> 00:56.333
Can't remember
his name, though.

00:56.366 --> 00:57.533
Good guy, though?

00:57.566 --> 00:58.700
A little long‐winded
for my taste.

00:58.733 --> 01:00.333
But, yeah,
a pretty good guy.

01:00.366 --> 01:01.366
Well, glad to hear
he's a good guy at least.

01:01.400 --> 01:02.366
They have running water
down there?

01:03.433 --> 01:04.633
Anyhoo,

01:04.666 --> 01:06.466
the evening went
so well that, uh,

01:06.500 --> 01:08.733
we got up to a little bits
of a foolin' around.

01:08.766 --> 01:09.566
Did you French her?

01:09.600 --> 01:11.333
WAYNE: Kind of
out of line there, Dary.

01:11.366 --> 01:12.600
Did you go up her shirt?

01:12.633 --> 01:13.700
Now you're really
out of line, Dary.

01:13.733 --> 01:16.233
We did French,
that much I will reveal.

01:16.266 --> 01:17.733
Well, you already
revealed that much,

01:17.766 --> 01:19.433
might as well just tell us
if you went up her shirt.

01:19.466 --> 01:21.600
It's impolite
to kiss and tell, Dary.

01:21.633 --> 01:24.066
I don't like to
kiss and tell, but...

01:24.100 --> 01:25.633
The Frenchin's tooks
a hard left turn,

01:25.666 --> 01:27.066
from which I have
yets to recover.

01:29.500 --> 01:30.800
Do you wanna know what?

01:30.833 --> 01:33.033
I'm not asking you
to kiss and tell,

01:33.066 --> 01:34.266
'cause that's impolite.

01:34.300 --> 01:35.300
But...

01:36.266 --> 01:37.666
I'm kind of curious.

01:37.700 --> 01:39.500
Yeah, Dan, kiss and tell.

01:39.533 --> 01:43.066
I'm sure you boys have had
a couple of curve balls

01:43.100 --> 01:45.100
thrown your way
betwixt the sheets.

01:46.733 --> 01:49.566
Well, not to be impolite, but,

01:49.600 --> 01:52.300
you know, sometimes
a gal will be kissin' around

01:52.333 --> 01:54.533
on, like, the area
near your genitals,

01:54.566 --> 01:57.100
but not quite
on your genitals.

01:57.133 --> 01:58.500
Makes me ticklish
and insecure.

02:00.600 --> 02:02.200
You know,
not to be impolite,

02:02.233 --> 02:04.666
but sometimes a gal will do
some kissin' on the ears,

02:04.700 --> 02:06.033
which makes me uncomfortable,

02:06.066 --> 02:07.433
because even though
I clean my ears,

02:07.466 --> 02:09.366
sometimes a tater will just
roll out of there unexpected.

02:11.100 --> 02:12.333
(CHUCKLES)

02:12.366 --> 02:14.233
I kind of likes
both those things.

02:14.266 --> 02:15.733
Yeah, it's why you're called
"Squirrely Dan."

02:15.766 --> 02:17.400
Yeah, reason
fuckin' five million.

02:18.533 --> 02:20.500
Well, nots to be
impolite, but...

02:22.200 --> 02:24.066
This gal suggested that

02:25.733 --> 02:27.366
maybe I should have some

02:28.566 --> 02:30.033
attentions paid

02:32.066 --> 02:33.200
to my butts hole.

02:38.233 --> 02:39.366
That ever...

02:40.633 --> 02:42.766
Ever happen to you guys?

02:42.800 --> 02:45.033
Did you ever have a gal
suggest that you need

02:45.733 --> 02:47.133
some attentions paid

02:49.100 --> 02:50.333
to your butts holes?

03:00.800 --> 03:03.100
I'll take that as a hard no,
I guess?

03:04.366 --> 03:06.500
She put a couple of fingers
up there and...

03:08.633 --> 03:10.100
It turns out you got a...

03:10.133 --> 03:11.600
An erogenous zone up there.

03:11.633 --> 03:14.100
Found...
Found the hot button and...

03:15.400 --> 03:17.066
Gaves it a tickle and, uh...

03:19.366 --> 03:21.166
Yeah. Feels, uh...

03:22.233 --> 03:24.666
It feels pretty good,
you guys, okay?

03:24.700 --> 03:26.500
‐Pop fly.
‐I really liked it.

03:31.133 --> 03:33.133
It felt...
Felt very natural.

03:37.566 --> 03:38.433
Nice.

03:38.466 --> 03:40.100
That's how you get
the body in front of it.

03:40.133 --> 03:41.166
Get the body in front of it.

03:41.200 --> 03:42.766
They call it
"milking the prostate."

03:45.533 --> 03:47.433
Well, it's impolite
to kiss and tell.

03:48.333 --> 03:50.333
(THEME MUSIC PLAYING)

04:03.500 --> 04:05.766
‐Where's Stewart been, Katy?
‐He's not talking to me.

04:05.800 --> 04:07.533
‐Why?
‐I don't know.

04:07.566 --> 04:09.266
Here are your birthday
pancakes, big brother.

04:09.300 --> 04:10.566
Don't fuck with tradition.

04:10.600 --> 04:11.633
‐Thank you.
‐You're welcome.

04:11.666 --> 04:13.200
BOTH: Happy birthday, Wayne.

04:13.233 --> 04:15.100
Jinx. You owe me
a Coke.

04:15.133 --> 04:16.433
Well, see now, that
you can get in the States.

04:16.466 --> 04:18.266
What you can't get, though,
is Crush Cream Soda.

04:18.300 --> 04:20.333
BOTH: We got you
a present, Wayne.

04:20.366 --> 04:21.800
Two Cokes.

04:21.833 --> 04:23.366
We don't make a thing of
birthdays in this family.

04:23.400 --> 04:24.733
Can we skip my super‐soft
birthday party then this year?

04:24.766 --> 04:26.400
Hard no!

04:26.433 --> 04:28.100
It's not a birthday thing,
it's an efficiency thing.

04:28.133 --> 04:29.566
Uh, if you can be one thing,
you should be efficient.

04:29.600 --> 04:31.600
We got you an appointment
with a matchmaker.

04:31.633 --> 04:33.366
Get the... Take a...

04:33.400 --> 04:34.600
Well, start walkin'.

04:34.633 --> 04:36.166
Well, you won't
do online dating.

04:36.200 --> 04:38.333
There's no more MoDeans,
so you can't meet girls there.

04:38.366 --> 04:39.600
You're handcuffed, cowboy.

04:39.633 --> 04:41.066
‐Figure it out.
‐Yeah, figures it out.

04:41.100 --> 04:42.166
Don't you tell me
to figure it out.

04:42.200 --> 04:43.566
Yous are the ones
should figure it out.

04:43.600 --> 04:45.233
All you have to do is
sit down with a matchmaker,

04:45.266 --> 04:46.700
answer a few questions,

04:46.733 --> 04:48.600
and then she sets you up
on three dates with girls

04:48.633 --> 04:49.733
that she thinks
you'll jive with.

04:49.766 --> 04:51.400
Has anyone heard
from Jivin' Pete lately?

04:51.433 --> 04:52.800
Oh, yeah, yeah.

04:52.833 --> 04:54.466
No, Jivin' Pete's one nut
got all swole up...

04:54.500 --> 04:56.433
I don't give a shit about
Jivin' Pete's one nut.

04:56.466 --> 04:58.266
No, no, this is a story about
Jivin' Pete's other nut.

04:58.300 --> 04:59.533
Yeah, Jivin' Pete's
had himself

04:59.566 --> 05:01.366
a botched vasectomy
a little while back,

05:01.400 --> 05:02.733
so now his one nut's
there all swole up

05:02.766 --> 05:04.800
bigger than the first nut
that was all swole up.

05:04.833 --> 05:06.533
If you can believes
that nonsense.

05:06.566 --> 05:07.800
Was Jivin' showin' it
to people again?

05:07.833 --> 05:09.600
Oh, he's showin' it to people.
I seen it.

05:09.633 --> 05:11.266
‐You seen it, Dary?
‐Oh, I seen it.

05:11.300 --> 05:13.133
‐Yeah, I never seen it.
‐It looks like a rambutan.

05:13.166 --> 05:15.033
Which is to say,
this hairy fruit.

05:15.066 --> 05:16.166
So, not smooth
like a persimmon?

05:16.200 --> 05:18.333
DAN: No, although it is about
the size of a persimmons.

05:18.366 --> 05:20.133
Which, of course,
is much like a tomatoes.

05:20.166 --> 05:22.133
What sort of potent peace pipe
was some prick pulling off

05:22.166 --> 05:23.433
when he titled
tomatoes "fruits"?

05:24.333 --> 05:25.600
Well...

05:25.633 --> 05:27.733
Now both Jivin' Pete's nuts
have a story,

05:27.766 --> 05:30.366
which I hope guarantees
that I'll never have to listen

05:30.400 --> 05:32.533
to another story about
Jivin' Pete's nuts.

05:32.566 --> 05:34.333
‐He's a good guy.
‐He's a real good guy.

05:34.366 --> 05:35.633
‐No, he's a great guy.
‐Wayne.

05:35.666 --> 05:36.700
You're looking for love.

05:36.733 --> 05:38.200
And you said it yourself,

05:38.233 --> 05:40.066
"If you can be one thing,
be efficient."

05:40.100 --> 05:41.233
Do's it once, do's it rights.

05:41.266 --> 05:42.466
‐Figures it out.
‐Pitter patter,

05:42.500 --> 05:43.766
let's get at 'er,
figure it out.

05:43.800 --> 05:45.433
You shouldn't gang up
on people on their birthdays.

05:45.466 --> 05:47.466
We don't make a thing
of birthdays in this family.

05:47.500 --> 05:48.733
She's comin' this afternoon.

Why even praccy?

Like, I'm just gonna praccy
like a donkey.

at the hash marks

06:06.133 --> 06:07.466
at the fuckin' plug tendy
of ours.

Clappys from the hashys,

Just tossin' mad sui's
up the middle.

the Three Dates."

Katy...

06:55.366 --> 06:57.266
I forgot to tell her
not to tell you that.

06:57.300 --> 06:58.633
So, I've modeled my business

06:58.666 --> 07:01.700
after the charming story
that it's inspired by.

07:01.733 --> 07:04.233
I send my clients
on three dates,

07:04.266 --> 07:07.500

Goldilocks laid down in

07:07.533 --> 07:10.633
after eating the three
bears' porridge,

07:10.666 --> 07:15.766
maybe one is "too hard,"
and maybe one is "too soft."

07:15.800 --> 07:20.466
But in the end we hope
that maybe one is just right.

why don't you just

07:25.500 --> 07:27.200
tell me a little bit
about yourself.

can you just tell me

07:45.100 --> 07:47.466
a little bit about
your past relationship?

07:47.500 --> 07:49.433
You shouldn't air

Well, I'm about
to begin your story.

08:14.500 --> 08:17.233
Where maybe one is "too hard."

08:17.266 --> 08:20.600
Maybe one is, um...

08:20.633 --> 08:23.100
‐But in the end...
‐Yeah, you lost him.

08:24.166 --> 08:25.633
He seems...
He seems nice.

08:28.133 --> 08:29.533
Do you live...

08:29.566 --> 08:30.733
Do you live in here?

08:31.733 --> 08:33.066
So, what did you think of

08:33.100 --> 08:35.066
Goldilocks and the Three Dates
there, Wayne?

08:35.100 --> 08:36.633
Ready to fall in Goldi‐love?

08:37.366 --> 08:39.466
Or Goldi‐lust?

08:39.500 --> 08:42.200
You won't be Goldi‐laughin'
when I break your Goldi‐legs.

08:42.233 --> 08:43.500
Dim the Goldi‐lights?

08:43.533 --> 08:46.200
Nights of your Goldi‐life?

08:46.233 --> 08:48.433
Use your Goldi‐language.
Make her Goldi‐laugh.

08:48.466 --> 08:49.766
Make it Goldi‐last.

08:49.800 --> 08:51.300
Better Goldi‐lay off,
before they find

08:51.333 --> 08:52.733
your Goldi‐limbs
in a Goldi‐landfill,

08:52.766 --> 08:54.733
Goldi‐literally.

08:54.766 --> 08:56.133
Take her on a Goldi‐lunch?

08:56.166 --> 08:57.700
Maybe a Goldi‐late suppers?

08:58.833 --> 09:01.066
‐Maybe she's a Goldi‐lawyer.
‐Ooh.

09:01.100 --> 09:03.266
You think I'm Goldi‐lyin'?
Enough Goldi‐lip.

09:03.300 --> 09:05.133
A Goldi‐longshoresman
will find your bodies

09:05.166 --> 09:06.233
in the Goldi‐lake!

09:07.633 --> 09:11.166
Gentlemen, a question.
A query.

09:11.200 --> 09:14.066
‐An inquis...
‐Pitter patter.

09:14.100 --> 09:16.700
Has Katy mentioned anything
about me not talking to her?

09:16.733 --> 09:19.066
‐Can confirm.
‐Major league.

09:19.100 --> 09:20.433
‐It's working.
‐What's working?

09:20.466 --> 09:22.066
By not talking to her,
she will form the conclusion

09:22.100 --> 09:24.666
that I'm upset with her
and eventually ask me why.

09:24.700 --> 09:26.133
Why you so butt‐hurt, Stewart?

09:27.666 --> 09:28.700
‐Well, she acts like...
‐Just kidding.

09:28.733 --> 09:30.233
‐I don't give a fuck.
‐DAN: Wait.

09:30.266 --> 09:31.300
So, you're upsets with her,

09:31.333 --> 09:34.300
and you wanna communicate that
by not communicatings?

09:34.333 --> 09:36.100
Acutely.

09:36.133 --> 09:38.166
You are spare parts,
aren't you, bud?

09:39.833 --> 09:41.466
Let me know
if Katy asks about me.

09:43.800 --> 09:45.166
Heads up!

09:45.200 --> 09:46.266
Ow!

09:49.766 --> 09:51.200
(MUSIC PLAYING)

10:01.766 --> 10:03.166
I'm Kim.

10:03.200 --> 10:04.500
I'm a psychologist
and a feminist.

10:04.533 --> 10:06.266
‐I'll be paying the bill.
‐I'm Wayne.

10:07.166 --> 10:08.200
Wayne!

10:08.233 --> 10:09.466
Glen.
How are you now?

10:09.500 --> 10:11.600
‐Ah, good and you?
‐Oh, not so bad.

10:11.633 --> 10:14.133
Well, I guess the kitten's
out of the clutch on this one.

10:14.166 --> 10:16.300
I also have
to work as a waitress

10:16.333 --> 10:17.366
to make ends meet.

10:17.400 --> 10:18.766
‐WAYNE: Sure you do.
‐I'm Kim.

10:18.800 --> 10:20.066
Are you ever.

10:20.100 --> 10:21.533
Look at you.
I'm lovin' this.

10:21.566 --> 10:23.366
You're like a shark.
I'm scared.

10:23.400 --> 10:25.500
Like a Julie Moore,
or like a Jessie Chastain.

10:25.533 --> 10:27.766
‐What can I get you to drink?
‐Uh, we'll need a minute.

10:27.800 --> 10:30.066
Uh, please and thank you.

10:30.100 --> 10:31.200
Hmm. All right.

10:31.233 --> 10:33.166
Well, you'll take care of
little Miss Nicki Kidman here

10:33.200 --> 10:35.033
till I get back,
Mr. McConaughey?

10:35.066 --> 10:36.233
‐Sure, I will.
‐All right.

10:38.233 --> 10:40.033
He crosses his arms.

10:40.066 --> 10:42.100
Are you aware of
the psychology behind that?

10:42.133 --> 10:43.166
Now, when you say "he,"

10:43.200 --> 10:44.566
you're talking
about me, right?

10:44.600 --> 10:46.133
He has wit.

10:46.166 --> 10:47.633
Do you know why
you cross your arms?

10:47.666 --> 10:49.700
Feels like you're talking
to two people right now.

10:49.733 --> 10:51.266
Crossing your arms,

10:51.300 --> 10:52.600
whether it be consciously
or subconsciously,

10:52.633 --> 10:54.100
is a sign of defense.

10:54.133 --> 10:55.700
You're protecting
your vital organs.

10:55.733 --> 10:57.033
Do you feel threatened by me?

10:57.066 --> 10:58.700
Well, I don't,
but the other guy might.

10:58.733 --> 11:00.733
He is hilarious.

11:00.766 --> 11:02.533
Enough psychology for now.

11:02.566 --> 11:04.500
What do you know
about feminism, Wayne?

11:04.533 --> 11:06.800
I know it's unsafe territory
to discuss with a feminist.

11:06.833 --> 11:08.433
‐Why?
‐Someone will start shoutin'.

11:08.466 --> 11:10.300
‐Why?
‐I don't know.

11:10.333 --> 11:12.433
Feminism is the belief
that women and men

11:12.466 --> 11:14.733
should have equal rights
and opportunities.

11:14.766 --> 11:16.600
So, are you a feminist, Wayne?

11:16.633 --> 11:18.233
Well, I trust my sister

11:18.266 --> 11:20.800
with just about any job
under the sun over a man.

11:20.833 --> 11:22.700
‐But 'cept this one, I guess.
‐Excuse me?

11:22.733 --> 11:25.266
Not to be impolite but you're
not exposed to talk about sex,

11:25.300 --> 11:27.733
politics or religion
at the supper table.

11:27.766 --> 11:30.200
(SIGHING)
What do you want, Wayne?

11:30.233 --> 11:32.800
‐I'd have a Gus'n Bru, likely.
‐Not what I'm asking.

11:32.833 --> 11:34.566
What's a Gus'n Bru?

11:34.600 --> 11:36.433
Ooh!
I'll google it and find out.

11:36.466 --> 11:38.166
I'm kiddin'.
I know exactly what it is.

11:38.200 --> 11:39.600
But we don't have any.

11:39.633 --> 11:40.800
So, what can
I get you to drink?

11:40.833 --> 11:43.100
I'll have a Caesar
and he'll have a...

11:43.133 --> 11:44.466
Pint of lager, please.
Something local.

11:44.500 --> 11:45.733
‐Thank you.
‐GLEN: All right.

11:45.766 --> 11:47.766
So, a local lager
for Mr. Brando

11:47.800 --> 11:49.566
and a Caesar
for Sandy Bullock.

11:49.600 --> 11:51.433
I love those orders.
Be right back.

11:52.700 --> 11:54.600
I didn't think they'd have it
at Four Dancers.

11:54.633 --> 11:57.333
Yes, I didn't think they'd
have it at this resto‐bar.

11:57.366 --> 11:59.600
‐Gastro‐pub.
‐Says "resto‐bar" on the sign.

11:59.633 --> 12:01.200
It's more of a micro‐bistro.

12:01.233 --> 12:03.333
Says brasserie on the menu
right there, too.

12:03.366 --> 12:05.166
It's more of
a bistro‐brasserie.

12:05.200 --> 12:06.600
When I came in
they asked me if I wanted

12:06.633 --> 12:08.500
to sit at the resto‐bar
or the gastro‐lounge.

12:08.533 --> 12:10.066
I'm glad you chose
the resto‐bar.

12:10.100 --> 12:11.566
This is actually
the gastro‐lounge.

12:13.366 --> 12:16.733
Do you know what
an emergency call is, Wayne?

12:16.766 --> 12:18.766
‐Negative.
‐It's when you have a friend

12:18.800 --> 12:21.533
call 10, 15 minutes
into a date

12:21.566 --> 12:23.366
to be sure the date
isn't a total bust.

12:23.400 --> 12:26.066
And if it is, then you can
play the phone call

12:26.100 --> 12:28.166
as though it's an emergency
and leave the date.

12:28.200 --> 12:29.500
Well, that's fair.

12:29.533 --> 12:30.766
I guess we are first cousin
to an emergency here.

12:30.800 --> 12:32.200
A good one.

12:32.233 --> 12:34.066
And you shouldn't
be afraid of it.

12:34.100 --> 12:36.000
I think we could do
good things here.

12:36.766 --> 12:39.033
I'm going to call my friend

12:39.066 --> 12:41.500
and cancel
her pending emergency call,

12:41.533 --> 12:43.466
and when I get back,

12:43.500 --> 12:45.666
let's talk about
your feelings, Wayne.

12:45.700 --> 12:49.066
‐Okay.
‐Let's really talk about them.

12:49.100 --> 12:51.233
‐Okay.
‐I wanna take 'em,

12:51.266 --> 12:53.000
and I wanna talk about them.

13:10.466 --> 13:12.233
Oh, it's Wayne.
How are you now?

13:12.766 --> 13:14.100
Oh, not so bad.

13:14.133 --> 13:16.000
Yeah, this one's too hard.

13:20.080 --> 13:22.480
(TECHNO MUSIC PLAYING)

13:22.513 --> 13:24.947
We don't have time
to discuss that business.

13:28.813 --> 13:29.813
Devon.

13:33.913 --> 13:35.780
Stewart.

13:35.813 --> 13:38.180
I come in peace.

13:38.213 --> 13:39.480
How do we know
you don't have another one

13:39.513 --> 13:40.547
of those in your sock?

13:40.580 --> 13:41.813
You don't.

13:44.213 --> 13:46.247
Speak.
Do not approach.

13:46.280 --> 13:48.913
‐Seen Katy around?
‐No.

13:48.947 --> 13:51.047
‐That is all.
‐(GROWLING) Stewart!

13:53.547 --> 13:55.180
Trouble in paradise?

13:55.213 --> 13:57.313
If there was,
she wouldn't know it.

13:57.347 --> 13:58.880
I'm not talking to her.

13:58.913 --> 14:00.780
Well played.
Wait it out.

14:00.813 --> 14:02.013
That way she'll come
to the conclusion that

14:02.047 --> 14:03.413
you're upset with her
and ask you why.

14:03.447 --> 14:05.513
‐Precisely.
‐She should anyway.

14:05.547 --> 14:07.180
‐If she's smart.
‐I know.

14:07.213 --> 14:09.180
‐Why are you mad at her?
‐She acts like...

14:09.213 --> 14:10.347
You should try
an open relationship.

14:11.347 --> 14:12.547
Could be productive.

14:12.580 --> 14:13.780
You could also
try a hall pass.

14:13.813 --> 14:14.680
It's when you give, you know,

14:14.713 --> 14:16.080
her being allowed
to sleep with one person

14:16.113 --> 14:18.113
and that's it,
no questions asked.

14:18.147 --> 14:19.547
Another plausibly
fruitful option.

14:19.580 --> 14:21.513
New GTA and COD out today.

14:21.547 --> 14:23.313
We're going to sesh.

14:23.347 --> 14:25.080
‐Been gaming much?
‐Always gaming.

14:26.013 --> 14:27.313
‐You?
‐Just gamed.

14:27.347 --> 14:29.247
Stimulating morning game.

14:29.280 --> 14:30.447
Evening game will eclipse.

14:30.480 --> 14:31.847
I gamed a 4:00‐to‐4:00 shift
last night.

14:31.880 --> 14:33.013
You're gaming
taxi driver's hours?

14:33.047 --> 14:34.280
I gamed a 10:00‐to‐4:00 shift
today.

14:34.313 --> 14:35.847
Gaming banker's hours.

14:35.880 --> 14:37.913
I'll probably game
a 5:00‐to‐7:00 shift now.

14:37.947 --> 14:39.947
Cinq a sept.
Nous aussi.

14:40.980 --> 14:42.413

a happy hour?

another happy hour.

‐Glen, how are you now?
‐Good and you?

‐Not so bad.
‐Well, I guess the teddy's

15:30.347 --> 15:31.913
out of the tickle trunk
on this one, too.

15:31.947 --> 15:33.847
I also work here.

15:33.880 --> 15:36.547
Reason is the Salty Treat
blew out an amp the other day,

15:36.580 --> 15:38.947
rockin' out pretty hard
to some Lifehouse covers,

15:38.980 --> 15:39.980
which will happen.

15:40.013 --> 15:41.347
So, I'm pickin' up the slack.
I'm happy to do it.

15:41.380 --> 15:42.847
Way she goes.

15:42.880 --> 15:44.180
I'm Lisa.

15:44.213 --> 15:46.047
Are you ever.
Look at you!

15:46.080 --> 15:47.880
It's America's little
sweetheart over here.

15:47.913 --> 15:49.147
You're like
a little Katy Heigl

15:49.180 --> 15:51.347
or like a little Katy Hudson.

15:51.380 --> 15:52.513
What can I get ya?

15:52.547 --> 15:53.947
Do you have cookies and cream?

15:53.980 --> 15:55.047
Do I...
(LAUGHS)

15:55.080 --> 15:56.247
Do I have cookies and cream?

15:56.280 --> 15:58.047
I sure do have
cookies and cream.

15:58.080 --> 16:01.913
(SIGHS) And I'm thinkin' maybe
a vanilla‐fudge swirl chunk

16:01.947 --> 16:03.247
for Mr. Newman over here?

16:03.280 --> 16:04.847
‐That'll do, thank you.
‐Okay.

16:04.880 --> 16:06.547
And you're gonna keep an eye
on little Caty Blanchett here

16:06.580 --> 16:07.813
‐for me till I get back?
‐Sure will.

16:07.847 --> 16:09.280
Thank you! Be right back!

16:11.213 --> 16:13.847
‐So, you're a farmer, Wayne?
‐Can confirm.

16:13.880 --> 16:15.080
You don't smell like one.

16:15.113 --> 16:17.380
(CHUCKLES) I'm kidding.

16:17.413 --> 16:19.380
I'm a pre‐school principal.
Do you like kids?

16:19.413 --> 16:21.447
‐Hmm...
‐I know, everyone likes kids.

16:21.480 --> 16:22.780
They're so silly.

16:22.813 --> 16:24.347
I love them
when they're silly.

16:24.380 --> 16:27.813
But if they get too silly,
they have to come see me.

16:27.847 --> 16:28.913
‐"Silly"?
‐Mischief.

16:28.947 --> 16:30.813
‐Trouble.
‐We use gentler terms.

16:30.847 --> 16:31.780
As a policy.

16:31.813 --> 16:33.780
Well, so what happens
when they come see you?

16:33.813 --> 16:36.480
Well, we do things a little
differently in our program.

16:36.513 --> 16:39.113
The approach is progressive
and positive.

16:39.147 --> 16:41.047
We issue
a hug consent form to parents,

16:41.080 --> 16:42.513
which allows us
to hug their kids.

16:42.547 --> 16:46.847
Because 99% of the time,
all kids need is a hug.

16:46.880 --> 16:47.913
‐"A hug"?
‐A squeeze.

16:47.947 --> 16:48.980
Well, you squeeze 'em.

16:49.013 --> 16:50.180
‐An embrace.
‐Oh.

16:50.213 --> 16:51.813
‐Oh?
‐Well...

16:51.847 --> 16:53.047
‐What is it?
‐Nothin'.

16:53.080 --> 16:54.280
‐Wayne.
‐Yeah?

16:54.313 --> 16:56.313
‐Speak freely.
‐No, I'd better not.

16:56.347 --> 16:58.880
That's the only way
we'll get to know each other.

16:58.913 --> 17:00.313
But do you ever smack 'em?

17:00.347 --> 17:02.513
‐Excuse me?
‐Like, give 'em a good whack?

17:02.547 --> 17:05.447
‐I don't follow.
‐Do you ever hit the kid?

17:05.480 --> 17:07.313
Like, for being too silly.

17:07.347 --> 17:09.213
No! Wayne.

17:09.247 --> 17:11.913
We never hit our kids.
You shouldn't hit kids.

17:11.947 --> 17:13.080
Well, you know what,

17:13.113 --> 17:14.513
don't you remember
how scared you were

17:14.547 --> 17:16.180
of your principal
when you were growing up?

17:16.213 --> 17:17.447
It's 'cause he'd smack you
if you were being too silly.

17:17.480 --> 17:18.880
Like your parents
wanted you

17:18.913 --> 17:20.213
to have a principal
who would smack you.

17:20.247 --> 17:21.813
They took comfort in the fact

17:21.847 --> 17:23.047
that they were sending you
to a place every day

17:23.080 --> 17:24.847
where someone would
smack you for them

17:24.880 --> 17:26.047
if you were being
too silly.

17:26.080 --> 17:27.313
And sometimes
I see kids these days,

17:27.347 --> 17:28.347
I kind of think, like...

17:29.480 --> 17:31.280
Like, wish you could
still do that.

17:31.313 --> 17:33.513
That sort of discipline
is long outdated, Wayne,

17:33.547 --> 17:34.980
and frowned upon.

17:35.013 --> 17:36.047
We sit the child down...

17:36.080 --> 17:37.813
‐That's another problem.
‐What is?

17:37.847 --> 17:39.380
‐In my opinion.
‐Sitting?

17:39.413 --> 17:41.147
Well, no wonder
kids are failin' school,

17:41.180 --> 17:42.413
just sittin' around all day.

17:42.447 --> 17:44.013
Stand up,
you're not doing nothin'.

17:44.047 --> 17:45.313
You think sitting
is a problem?

17:45.347 --> 17:46.780
‐Yeah.
‐Why?

17:46.813 --> 17:48.147
'Cause it makes you soft.

17:48.180 --> 17:51.147
‐Literally or figuratively?
‐Well, both, I suppose.

17:51.180 --> 17:52.913
‐Both?
‐Yeah.

17:52.947 --> 17:54.280
In my opinion.

17:54.313 --> 17:55.413
My phone's buzzing.

17:57.913 --> 17:59.947
Well, so you like cookies
and cream ice cream, hey?

17:59.980 --> 18:01.147
Well, I think
it's pretty good, too.

18:01.180 --> 18:02.347
Hi, Michelle.

18:02.913 --> 18:04.147
Oh, no.

18:04.180 --> 18:06.380
Okay,
I'll be right there.

18:06.413 --> 18:08.113
I'm sorry, Wayne,
I've gotta go.

18:08.147 --> 18:09.947
‐It's...
‐An emergency.

18:09.980 --> 18:11.180
‐Yeah.
‐Okay.

18:23.547 --> 18:25.180
It's Wayne.

18:25.213 --> 18:26.780
Well, how are you now?

18:26.813 --> 18:28.180
Oh, not so bad.

18:28.213 --> 18:29.947
Yeah, this one's too soft.

What?

19:05.413 --> 19:06.780
(SCOFFS)

19:06.813 --> 19:08.147
I'm not talking to you.

19:08.180 --> 19:09.280
Super.

19:10.447 --> 19:12.147
‐(SIGHS)
‐It's been three days.

19:12.180 --> 19:13.847
Why haven't you asked me
what's wrong?

19:13.880 --> 19:16.213
‐Something wrong?
‐Of course it is.

19:16.247 --> 19:18.780
‐You act like I don't...
‐Should I have known that?

19:18.813 --> 19:20.447
It's called
"the silent treatment."

19:20.480 --> 19:22.313
Step one,
I stop talking to you.

19:22.347 --> 19:23.913
Step two,
you form the conclusion

19:23.947 --> 19:25.047
that something is wrong.

19:25.080 --> 19:27.413
Step three,
you ask me what's wrong.

19:27.447 --> 19:28.813
What's up with step one?

19:28.847 --> 19:30.047
You've skipped
step one and two.

19:30.080 --> 19:31.780
What's step three again?

19:31.813 --> 19:33.880
You ask me what's wrong!

19:33.913 --> 19:34.913
Got it.

19:35.513 --> 19:36.847
Good.

19:36.880 --> 19:37.880
You bet.

19:39.913 --> 19:40.980
Go ahead.

19:41.480 --> 19:42.947
Where?

19:42.980 --> 19:44.913
‐Step three.
‐What's step three again?

19:44.947 --> 19:46.313
(EXHALES)

19:46.347 --> 19:48.147
We'll skip step three.

19:48.180 --> 19:49.880
I'm just going to tell you
what's wrong.

19:49.913 --> 19:51.213
That should have
been step one.

19:51.247 --> 19:53.880
Wrong. Step one and two
are fundamental steps.

19:53.913 --> 19:56.113
You missed steps, Stewart.

19:56.147 --> 19:57.513
How?

19:57.547 --> 20:00.080
Step one,
become angry with someone.

20:00.113 --> 20:03.180
Step two, tell that someone
that you're angry.

20:03.213 --> 20:05.913
Step three, resolve anger
with that someone.

20:05.947 --> 20:07.547
‐Step four...
‐(SCOFFING) Step four.

20:07.580 --> 20:10.813
Step four,
resume peaceful existence.

20:13.947 --> 20:16.947
Your logic is
frighteningly bewitching.

20:18.080 --> 20:19.447
Phantasmagoric.

20:19.480 --> 20:21.080
It's time for you to go.

20:22.413 --> 20:23.413
What?

20:24.180 --> 20:25.380
Where?

20:25.413 --> 20:26.413
Leave here?

20:27.247 --> 20:28.780
It was a rebound.

20:28.813 --> 20:30.880
Even though there was no
physical act of rebounding,

20:30.913 --> 20:32.280
which is a first for me.

20:32.313 --> 20:33.447
(SCOFFS) Gross.

20:35.480 --> 20:36.913
Seriously, Katy.

20:38.047 --> 20:39.047
W5.

20:39.080 --> 20:42.213
No one has time for
the silent treatment, Stewart.

20:42.247 --> 20:43.947
Not even in Letterkenny.

20:43.980 --> 20:45.147
Adios.

Hi, Wayne.

Angie.

21:50.580 --> 21:51.780
Wayne!

21:53.413 --> 21:56.180
Oh, my gourd,
what a coincidence.

21:56.213 --> 21:58.047
Oh, I bet you're thinkin'
I work here.

21:58.080 --> 21:59.113
I don't work here.

21:59.147 --> 22:00.780
I just love Guy's fries.

22:00.813 --> 22:02.780
They're so crispy,
and you add a little salt...

22:02.813 --> 22:04.213
(LAUGHS) I just think
they're so delicious.

22:05.247 --> 22:07.447
Ooh! Who is this?

22:07.480 --> 22:09.113
You're a masterpiece,
aren't ya?

22:09.147 --> 22:12.413
You're like a Shelly Pfeiffer,
you're like a Charlie Theron,

22:12.447 --> 22:13.947
or like a Penny Cruz.

22:13.980 --> 22:15.047
Ooh!

22:15.080 --> 22:16.247
You're like
a little Angie Jolie.

22:16.280 --> 22:18.080
That's who you are,
you're Angie.

22:18.113 --> 22:19.347
How are you now?

22:19.380 --> 22:21.780
‐Good and you?
‐Not so bad.

22:21.813 --> 22:22.980
Can we talk?

22:23.013 --> 22:24.313
‐Okay.
‐"Talk."

22:26.147 --> 22:27.180
In your truck.

22:30.347 --> 22:31.347
Okay.

22:33.147 --> 22:34.947
Now that was just right.

22:35.547 --> 22:37.313
(EXHALES)

22:37.347 --> 22:39.413
So how did you make out,
super chief?

22:39.447 --> 22:41.013
Did you find the missing
Goldi‐link?

22:41.047 --> 22:42.347
You fallin' in Goldi‐love?

22:42.380 --> 22:43.413
It's better
to Goldi‐let this go,

22:43.447 --> 22:44.880
before I Goldi‐lose my shit.

22:44.913 --> 22:46.847
Oh, take your drink,
you Goldi‐lush.

22:46.880 --> 22:48.080
Tread Goldi‐lightly.

22:49.447 --> 22:50.913
So, that's no
toe‐curlin' then?

22:50.947 --> 22:52.280
It's impolite
to kiss and tell.

22:52.313 --> 22:53.947
Nothin' wrong with a little
stank on the hang down.

22:53.980 --> 22:55.480
Nothin' wrong with a little
takesin' out in the trades.

22:55.513 --> 22:57.080
A little hizzin'
in the skizzins.

22:57.113 --> 22:58.213
No, I know there's
nothin' wrong with a little

22:58.247 --> 22:59.447
goin' to the bone yard,
I know that.

22:59.480 --> 23:01.047

a little bacon makin'.

23:01.080 --> 23:02.780
Nothin' wrong with a little
shot twixt winds and waters.

23:02.813 --> 23:04.413
A little building
the blanket monster.

23:04.447 --> 23:06.180
I know there's nothin' wrong
with a little pituitary poke.

23:06.213 --> 23:07.813
‐I know that.
‐Nothin' wrong with a little

23:07.847 --> 23:09.313
makin' the beast
with two backs.

23:09.347 --> 23:11.047
Makin' feet
for children's stockin's.

23:11.080 --> 23:12.080
Testing the tube steak.

23:12.113 --> 23:13.280
Look, I know
there's nothin' wrong

23:13.313 --> 23:14.480
with a little crawl
up the skin slide.

23:14.513 --> 23:16.447
‐I know that.
‐Nothin' wrong with a little,

23:16.480 --> 23:19.547
"Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes!"

23:19.580 --> 23:21.180
Now just pump the brakes
right there.

23:21.213 --> 23:22.913
‐I got a question.
‐Have at 'er.

23:22.947 --> 23:24.047
Then I got a comment.

23:24.080 --> 23:25.047
Well, let's hear it,
good buddy.

23:25.080 --> 23:26.280
Now, my question.

23:26.313 --> 23:27.413
When have you ever
heard a girl go,

23:27.447 --> 23:28.913
"Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes."

23:28.947 --> 23:31.013
‐Well...
‐Other than in a porno.

23:32.213 --> 23:33.780
‐I don't believe I have.
‐Me neithers.

23:33.813 --> 23:35.347
That's because
we don't say that.

23:35.380 --> 23:37.247
‐Well...
‐Not unless it's in a porno.

23:37.280 --> 23:38.413
WAYNE: Now my comment.

23:38.447 --> 23:40.380
You see, the way Dary did the
"yes, yes, yes, yes, yes's"

23:40.413 --> 23:42.813
is not the way they do
the "yes, yes, yes" in pornos.

23:42.847 --> 23:44.147
That's the way they do it.

23:44.180 --> 23:46.047
The girl gets all excited,
and she goes,

23:46.080 --> 23:49.347
"Yes, yes, yes,
yes, yes, yes."

23:49.380 --> 23:51.213
Yes, but the way you're doing
the "yes, yes, yes, yes's"

23:51.247 --> 23:53.013
is not the way they do
the "yes, yes, yes, yes, yes."

23:53.047 --> 23:54.813
DARYL: It is the way
they do it.

23:54.847 --> 23:57.147
They go,
"Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes."

23:57.180 --> 23:58.180
That's exactly
how they do it.

23:58.213 --> 23:59.447
WAYNE: No, they don't.

23:59.480 --> 24:00.413
What they do is
they find a super‐high pitch

24:00.447 --> 24:01.913
for those first four yes's.

24:01.947 --> 24:02.780
And then
they come in all dramatic

24:02.813 --> 24:03.947
for that final "yes."

24:03.980 --> 24:05.447
So, it goes a little something
like, "Yes, yes, yes, yes."

24:05.480 --> 24:06.480
And then they
get all dramatic

24:06.513 --> 24:07.547
for that final "yes."

24:07.580 --> 24:09.447
Say, "Yes! Oh."

24:09.480 --> 24:10.880
I don't think that's
how they do it.

24:10.913 --> 24:12.047
I'd have to hears it again.

24:12.080 --> 24:14.913
"Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes!"

24:14.947 --> 24:16.880
Yeah.
Yeah, porno girls do that.

24:16.913 --> 24:18.080
But only when
the porno guys

24:18.113 --> 24:20.313
aren't busy finding
some super‐low tone

24:20.347 --> 24:22.347
and repeating
over and over again,

24:22.380 --> 24:23.947
"Ah, fuck.

24:23.980 --> 24:25.780
"Ah, fuck."

24:25.813 --> 24:27.480
I takes a bit offense to that,
Miss Katy,

24:27.513 --> 24:29.180
as I have
a naturally low voice,

24:29.213 --> 24:31.347
and I do likes to say,
"Ah, fuck.

24:31.380 --> 24:32.780
"Ah, fuck."

24:32.813 --> 24:34.080
Exceptin' I don't
do it in pornos.

24:34.113 --> 24:35.413
Well, then you should
do voiceovers

24:35.447 --> 24:37.047
for English‐dubbed
foreign pornos, Dan,

24:37.080 --> 24:40.247
because that was a text book
"ah, fuck, ah, fuck."

24:40.280 --> 24:41.380
Why thank you, Miss Katy.

24:41.413 --> 24:42.447
I've never had
any complaints from

24:42.480 --> 24:43.880
any of my sexual companions

24:43.913 --> 24:46.813
about my
"ah, fuck, ah, fuck."

24:48.213 --> 24:49.447
KATY: Let me hear yours, Dary.

24:49.480 --> 24:51.013
Well, I...
I'm confused still on the

24:51.047 --> 24:53.147
"yes, yes, yes, yes, yes's."

24:53.180 --> 24:55.913
So, Wayne,
it's like, uh,

24:55.947 --> 24:58.447
"Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes"?

24:58.480 --> 25:00.447
See, it's not as if it's a
fuckin' question, Dary, is it?

25:00.480 --> 25:02.080
You're saying it
like it's a question.

25:02.113 --> 25:06.447
So, it's like,
"Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes."

25:06.480 --> 25:07.980
You're gettin closer, Dary,
but what you want to do

25:08.013 --> 25:09.080
is put a little pepper
on the end of it.

25:09.113 --> 25:10.413
You just want to put a little
pepper on the end of it.

25:10.447 --> 25:12.013
Like, "Yes!"

25:13.247 --> 25:14.547
"Yes!"

25:14.580 --> 25:15.880
"Ah, fuck."

25:15.913 --> 25:17.447
‐It's like, "Yes, yes, yes..."
‐"Ah, fuck."

25:17.480 --> 25:19.280
‐"...yes, yes, yes!"
‐"Ah, fuck."

25:19.313 --> 25:21.813
Like, "Yes, yes, yes,
yes, yes!"

25:21.847 --> 25:22.913
"Yes!"
