00:01.369 --> 00:03.871
ANNOUNCER: Free the innocent.
Find the guilty.

00:03.971 --> 00:06.707
-Are you sure
you want to poke the bear?
-I want to rip his heart out.

00:06.807 --> 00:09.710
ANNOUNCER: All-new episodes

Only on Fox.

00:17.017 --> 00:18.919
Previously on
Proven Innocent...

00:18.952 --> 00:21.189
We're here with wrongful
conviction attorney

00:21.222 --> 00:23.657
-Madeline Scott.
-We'd like to be your lawyers.

00:23.691 --> 00:26.160
VIOLET:
Gore Bellows is
the very prosecutor

00:26.194 --> 00:28.362
who wrongfully convicted
Madeline and her brother

00:28.396 --> 00:31.365
of the first-degree murder
of her best friend.

00:31.399 --> 00:32.533
HEATHER:
Most of us in town still think

00:32.566 --> 00:33.867
you should be in jail.

00:33.901 --> 00:35.436
I would lose a Pulitzer

00:35.469 --> 00:36.537
for a date with you.

00:36.570 --> 00:37.705
I got a line on Madeline Scott.

00:37.738 --> 00:40.274
I announce my candidacy
for attorney general.

00:40.308 --> 00:41.942
How many innocent lives
has he destroyed?

00:41.975 --> 00:43.711
Are you sure you want
to poke the bear?

00:43.744 --> 00:45.379
No, I want to rip his heart out.

00:47.047 --> 00:50.351
-(laughing)
-Okay.

00:50.384 --> 00:51.819
Hilarious.

00:53.987 --> 00:55.423
(sniffs, grunts)

00:56.557 --> 00:59.193
-You want another?
-Yes.

00:59.227 --> 01:00.194
-Yes.
-Okay.

01:00.228 --> 01:02.730
-Roxy, another round.
-(chuckles)

01:02.763 --> 01:04.098
Hey, I ain't never seen you
in here before.

01:04.132 --> 01:05.233
No, but I love it.

01:05.266 --> 01:07.368
-It's so hard-core. (laughs)
-Yeah?

01:07.401 --> 01:08.936
Oh, we should do a selfie.

01:08.969 --> 01:09.937
Yeah?

01:09.970 --> 01:11.905
Yeah.
(laughs)

01:11.939 --> 01:15.042
Oh, wait, no,
I want to see the scar.

01:15.075 --> 01:16.610
Oh, it's so hot.

01:16.644 --> 01:19.147
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

01:19.180 --> 01:20.381
-Okay. Okay.
-Okay.

01:20.414 --> 01:21.382
(both laugh)

01:21.415 --> 01:22.383
How's that?

01:22.416 --> 01:24.952
-That's perfect.
-(clicks)

01:24.985 --> 01:27.054
(both laugh)

01:27.087 --> 01:29.390
What are you doing in here
all by your lonesome, huh?

01:29.423 --> 01:31.725
You, uh, looking to meet
your prince charming?

01:31.759 --> 01:34.061
(laughs)
God, no.

01:34.094 --> 01:35.896
No, I'm here
to serve you a subpoena

01:35.929 --> 01:37.531
in the Tamara Folsom case.

01:42.970 --> 01:44.338
(grunts)

01:44.372 --> 01:46.707
("Can't Catch Me"
by NoMBe playing)

01:49.042 --> 01:52.112
* Yeah, yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah *

01:52.980 --> 01:55.082
(man grunts)

01:55.115 --> 01:56.584
MADELINE:
Bodie, cut him off
at the next block!

01:56.617 --> 01:58.686
Go... Just go after him!

02:05.125 --> 02:07.161
* See me down the street *

02:07.195 --> 02:08.296
* You can't get close *

02:08.329 --> 02:09.763
* 'Cause I'm much too fast *

02:09.797 --> 02:11.865
* And I'm much too loud *

02:11.899 --> 02:12.866
* And I'm so caught up... *

02:12.900 --> 02:14.101
(engine revving)

02:14.134 --> 02:15.636
(tires squeal)

02:15.669 --> 02:16.937
* Is it me *

02:16.970 --> 02:19.139
* Or my luck, can't get enough *

02:21.209 --> 02:23.611
* Feed on alchemy *

02:23.644 --> 02:26.280
* And I'm running
petrol through... *

02:26.314 --> 02:29.016
-(fabric tears)
-(yelps)

02:29.049 --> 02:31.319
* Watch me go... *

02:31.352 --> 02:32.620
(grunts)

02:32.653 --> 02:34.988
* And I feed off your love *

02:35.022 --> 02:36.324
* Can't get enough *

02:43.264 --> 02:45.733
-Where is he?
-He's in that truck-- go.

02:45.766 --> 02:47.468
You're bleeding.

02:47.501 --> 02:49.303
(grunts)
I'm fine. Will you go?

02:49.337 --> 02:51.071
No, come on.
We'll live to fight another day.

02:52.673 --> 02:55.142
Got to get you
some stitches, maybe.

02:55.175 --> 02:56.544
Does it hurt?

02:56.577 --> 02:58.346
MADELINE:
Yes, it hurts!

03:02.049 --> 03:03.016
VIOLET:
The fight for justice

03:03.050 --> 03:04.685
is unending.

03:04.718 --> 03:07.388
Every day in America,
someone is wrongfully accused.

03:07.421 --> 03:10.023
And far too many are convicted.

03:10.057 --> 03:13.327
This podcast
tells their stories.

03:13.361 --> 03:16.730
On today's episode
of Until Proven Innocent,

03:16.764 --> 03:18.899
we'll discuss the case
of Tamara Folsom.

03:18.932 --> 03:22.736
Tamara was charged with the
murder of a man she never met.

03:22.770 --> 03:24.905
The police
were confused, conflating

03:24.938 --> 03:27.408
her boast of fighting back
against the attacker

03:27.441 --> 03:30.711
as a confession to the murder
of a totally different person.

03:30.744 --> 03:33.113
It was a terrible mistake

03:33.146 --> 03:35.416
that got Tamara
locked away for life.

03:35.449 --> 03:37.251
Tamara told the truth,
but the police

03:37.285 --> 03:40.421
either didn't hear her
or didn't believe her.

03:40.454 --> 03:43.123
People say
"the truth will set you free."

03:43.156 --> 03:45.759
So what happens
when telling the truth

03:45.793 --> 03:48.195
is what ends up
costing you your freedom?

03:52.600 --> 03:55.202
TAMARA:
Yeah, that's him.

03:55.235 --> 03:58.872
That's him, all right. I'll
never forget his ugly-ass face.

03:58.906 --> 04:01.375
He look old now, though.

04:01.409 --> 04:03.143
So, now what?

04:03.176 --> 04:06.480
Put him on the stand and
he tells the judge I cut him.

04:06.514 --> 04:09.082
Once we find him again, yes.

04:09.116 --> 04:11.552
-Wait, you lost him?
-We're going to find him

04:11.585 --> 04:12.920
and this photo's gonna
get us another hearing.

04:12.953 --> 04:14.988
To prep you,
we want to go over your story

04:15.022 --> 04:16.957
-one more time, okay?
-MAN: I'll just need

04:16.990 --> 04:19.059
to go over your story
again, okay?

04:19.092 --> 04:21.395
It's not my "story,"
it's the truth.

04:21.429 --> 04:22.896
TAMARA:
I've been telling
the same story for years.

04:22.930 --> 04:26.166
Why did you tell the police
you slashed a man that night?

04:26.199 --> 04:28.235
I was proud of it.

04:28.268 --> 04:30.571
Creep tried to rape me
in a parking lot.

04:30.604 --> 04:31.939
Damn right I cut him.

04:31.972 --> 04:33.474
Why were you carrying a knife?

04:33.507 --> 04:36.176
Where I'm from,
you always carry a knife.

04:39.012 --> 04:40.781
When I was 12...

04:42.783 --> 04:43.917
...my mom married a man

04:43.951 --> 04:45.853
that would rape me
every chance he got.

04:45.886 --> 04:47.855
When I finally
got old enough, I vowed

04:47.888 --> 04:50.358
I'd never let nobody
do that to me again.

04:50.391 --> 04:52.793
After she divorced
the son of a bitch,

04:52.826 --> 04:55.629
-we never looked back.
-Does she still visit you?

04:55.663 --> 04:56.664
No, ma'am.

04:56.697 --> 04:59.800
She died a few years
after they locked me up.

04:59.833 --> 05:01.802
I never even got to go
to her funeral.

05:01.835 --> 05:03.804
I'm so sorry.

05:03.837 --> 05:06.273
Then, after you cut
Jeff Skadden, the police

05:06.306 --> 05:08.542
arrested you
the next week for the murder

05:08.576 --> 05:10.778
of Tim Manning,
who was also slashed that night.

05:10.811 --> 05:12.480
They kept asking me
why I killed him.

05:12.513 --> 05:13.781
I said I didn't.

05:13.814 --> 05:15.449
This wasn't the guy I cut.

05:15.483 --> 05:17.050
I never even met the man.

05:17.084 --> 05:19.186
I didn't kill Rosemary.
I swear.

05:19.219 --> 05:20.287
Why won't anyone believe me?

05:20.320 --> 05:22.490
I was defending myself
against someone else.

05:22.523 --> 05:23.824
EASY:
Why didn't your original lawyer

05:23.857 --> 05:25.325
look for the man
you really slashed?

05:26.326 --> 05:28.529
My public pretender.

05:28.562 --> 05:31.198
He didn't believe a word I said.

05:31.231 --> 05:33.534
Worst piece of crap lawyer ever.

05:36.437 --> 05:37.571
MADELINE:
Tamara.

05:37.605 --> 05:39.139
We hear you.

05:39.172 --> 05:41.041
We believe you.

05:41.074 --> 05:43.010
And we're gonna do
everything we can

05:43.043 --> 05:44.845
to get you the hell out of here.

06:01.462 --> 06:03.497
The number of wrongful
convictions in Cook County

06:03.531 --> 06:06.333
is skyrocketing,
and lazy, sloppy,

06:06.366 --> 06:08.168
corrupt prosecutions
are the reason.

06:08.201 --> 06:10.170
There's only one man
to blame for that.

06:10.203 --> 06:11.672
Gore Bellows.

06:11.705 --> 06:13.841
ALDERS:
If you're just joining us,
my guest today is

06:13.874 --> 06:15.242
Madeline Scott.

06:15.275 --> 06:18.278
You may remember her
as a drunken, lovesick teen

06:18.311 --> 06:20.781
who, along with
her brother Levi,

06:20.814 --> 06:23.283
allegedly murdered
her best friend Rosemary Lynch.

06:23.316 --> 06:26.687
A conviction that never would
have happened except for

06:26.720 --> 06:28.188
the corrupt prosecution
by Mr. Bellows.

06:28.221 --> 06:29.690
My brother and I spent

06:29.723 --> 06:31.625
ten years in prison for a murder

06:31.659 --> 06:32.893
we didn't commit because

06:32.926 --> 06:34.227
Bellows ignored
a medical examiner report

06:34.261 --> 06:36.464
that would have exonerated us.

06:36.497 --> 06:38.599
How many others
are suffering in silence

06:38.632 --> 06:40.100
because of his incompetence?

06:40.133 --> 06:42.536
Makes me wonder how the man
thinks he's qualified

06:42.570 --> 06:45.105
to be Illinois'
next attorney general.

06:46.073 --> 06:48.408
MADELINE:
He's not. And I'll keep

06:48.442 --> 06:50.978
telling my story to make sure
that never happens.

06:51.011 --> 06:52.112
Thank you, Madeline.

06:52.145 --> 06:53.647
We'll be right back.

07:00.521 --> 07:01.989
VIOLET:
Nearly every defendant

07:02.022 --> 07:04.091
who can't afford
their own attorney

07:04.124 --> 07:06.326
gets assigned a public defender.

07:06.359 --> 07:08.562
The same was true
for Tamara Folsom.

07:08.596 --> 07:12.666
But, like many public defenders,
hers was overworked

07:12.700 --> 07:14.334
and underpaid.

07:14.367 --> 07:17.571
MAN: I strongly advised
Ms. Folsom not to testify.

07:17.605 --> 07:19.339
She'd already confessed
to slicing the guy's neck.

07:19.372 --> 07:21.742
Admitting it in open court
would only make matters worse.

07:21.775 --> 07:24.578
Uh, but we've identified
that guy as Jeff Skadden,

07:24.612 --> 07:26.914
not the actual murder victim,
Tim Manning.

07:26.947 --> 07:30.651
Same town, same night,
two different neck slashes?

07:30.684 --> 07:32.452
-No one bought her story.
-Is that why you didn't

07:32.486 --> 07:34.655
look for Skadden--
because you didn't believe her?

07:34.688 --> 07:36.757
I did look
and I couldn't find him.

07:36.790 --> 07:38.191
How hard did you look?

07:38.225 --> 07:39.860
I was balancing
73 cases that month.

07:39.893 --> 07:42.329
That's why I'm not
a public defender anymore.

07:42.362 --> 07:43.931
The arrest report noted

07:43.964 --> 07:46.534
that there was DNA evidence
collected from the scene.

07:46.567 --> 07:49.336
-Did you seek to ascertain
the source of that DNA?
-Again,

07:49.369 --> 07:50.771
we didn't have the resources.

07:50.804 --> 07:53.106
Did you do literally anything?

07:53.140 --> 07:54.307
-Objection.
-Your Honor,

07:54.341 --> 07:56.944
Mr. Bryce's testimony is
nothing more than an attempt

07:56.977 --> 07:59.012
to cover up
an inadequate trial strategy

07:59.046 --> 08:01.782
that was manifestly
unreasonable.

08:01.815 --> 08:04.852
Petitioner requests the court
order a new trial on the grounds

08:04.885 --> 08:07.020
that Ms. Folsom's Sixth
Amendment rights to a fair trial

08:07.054 --> 08:08.488
were grotesquely violated.

08:08.522 --> 08:10.524
I'll take it under advisement,
but I'm more interested

08:10.558 --> 08:13.060
in hearing
from this Jeff Skadden.

08:13.093 --> 08:15.796
Uh, Your Honor, we're tracking
him down as we speak.

08:15.829 --> 08:17.631
While court considers
our motion,

08:17.665 --> 08:19.533
petitioner requests
we be allowed to test

08:19.567 --> 08:23.136
the potentially exculpatory
DNA evidence from the scene.

08:23.170 --> 08:25.038
It's time someone
from her defense

08:25.072 --> 08:26.306
finally looks at it.

08:26.339 --> 08:28.408
I think it's a terrific idea.

08:28.441 --> 08:29.810
Okay.

08:29.843 --> 08:30.911
We're adjourned.

08:30.944 --> 08:32.212
TAMARA:
Do I get a new case?

08:32.245 --> 08:34.214
-It's very positive.
-(whispering): That's so good.

08:34.247 --> 08:36.316
-Yeah, we're in good shape.
-Yeah, buys us a few days

08:36.349 --> 08:38.051
-for Bodie to find Skadden.
-Yeah, it's great.

08:38.085 --> 08:40.988
Uh, I have to go
to La Grange for Levi's trial,

08:41.021 --> 08:42.322
so I'll meet you back
at the office.

08:42.355 --> 08:44.224
(indistinct chatter)

08:44.257 --> 08:46.226
HEATHER:
Levi Scott

08:46.259 --> 08:48.562
never should have been released
from prison in the first place.

08:48.596 --> 08:50.998
He murdered my best friend.

08:51.031 --> 08:53.701
And I swore at her funeral
I'd never forget.

08:53.734 --> 08:56.436
Now he attacks my husband
for no reason whatsoever.

08:56.469 --> 08:57.671
(scoffs)

08:57.705 --> 08:59.740
Once a killer, always a killer.

08:59.773 --> 09:01.408
-You can quote me on that.
-Thank you.

09:02.810 --> 09:04.444
-That was awesome, babe.
-Can you take this?

09:04.477 --> 09:06.747
-Right, I'll see you soon.
-That's interesting.

09:06.780 --> 09:09.282
How someone who's dead
and can't speak up for herself

09:09.316 --> 09:11.752
-is suddenly your best friend.
-We were friends.

09:11.785 --> 09:13.253
Oh, yeah, like Bugs Bunny
and Elmer Fudd.

09:13.286 --> 09:15.122
You know, I bet that going
after my brother again

09:15.155 --> 09:17.791
is the biggest thrill you've had
since the first trial.

09:17.825 --> 09:19.026
And it'll be
an even greater thrill

09:19.059 --> 09:21.128
watching that loser
get locked up again.

09:23.096 --> 09:24.765
You're such a bitch.

09:24.798 --> 09:26.967
Takes one to know one.

09:27.000 --> 09:28.568
Nice shoes, by the way.

09:28.602 --> 09:31.238
Did you get them
at a garage sale?

09:31.271 --> 09:33.573
Yeah, well, your shoes
look cheap, too.

09:34.574 --> 09:36.176
Like you would know.

09:39.112 --> 09:40.748
Yeah, I can agree to that.

09:43.083 --> 09:44.618
Where is Levi?

09:44.652 --> 09:46.253
We've agreed
to anger management classes

09:46.286 --> 09:48.121
and community service,
but he still needs to be here.

09:48.155 --> 09:49.923
JUDGE:
Ms. Scott,
are we ready to proceed?

09:49.957 --> 09:51.925
Your Honor, may I approach?

09:56.296 --> 09:57.597
Apologies, Your Honor.

09:57.631 --> 09:59.332
My client still isn't here.

09:59.366 --> 10:00.801
I think maybe
that I wasn't clear

10:00.834 --> 10:02.502
-that his presence was required.
-You weren't clear?

10:02.535 --> 10:04.738
How about this for clarity?

10:04.772 --> 10:06.273
This court hereby issues
a bench warrant

10:06.306 --> 10:07.675
for the arrest of Levi Scott.

10:07.708 --> 10:09.276
(gavel slams)

10:17.217 --> 10:18.518
(scoffs)

10:18.551 --> 10:20.520
I have to get back to work.

10:26.226 --> 10:27.560
(breathing heavily)

10:42.642 --> 10:45.378
This is Assistant
State's Attorney Tracy Green

10:45.412 --> 10:47.114
receiving biological evidence.

10:47.147 --> 10:50.617
Case number 03-94-385.

10:50.650 --> 10:52.019
State of Illinois
v. Tamara Folsom.

10:52.052 --> 10:54.621
I'm now transferring
custody of evidence

10:54.654 --> 10:57.457
to petitioner counsel.

10:57.490 --> 10:59.126
Let the record reflect

10:59.159 --> 11:00.694
that I did not touch this box.

11:01.862 --> 11:03.230
The tape seal
on the evidence container

11:03.263 --> 11:04.264
has clearly been broken.

11:07.534 --> 11:10.203
A.S.A. Green confirms
the broken seal.

11:10.237 --> 11:11.571
I am opening the box now.

11:14.674 --> 11:16.109
The evidence is missing.

11:17.110 --> 11:19.880
-Without explanation.
-The evidence has been taken

11:19.913 --> 11:21.514
and, in all probability,
destroyed

11:21.548 --> 11:22.883
to keep an innocent woman
in prison.

11:22.916 --> 11:23.984
You have no evidence of that.

11:24.017 --> 11:25.285
We have no evidence at all.

11:36.196 --> 11:38.932
Sophie's dad is picking you up
after ballet tomorrow.

11:38.966 --> 11:41.568
But his car smells funny.
Why can't you pick us up?

11:41.601 --> 11:45.272
Because we carpool, and that's
the deal. Plus, I have to work.

11:45.305 --> 11:47.340
What do you mean funny, Audra?

11:47.374 --> 11:49.943
Like strange funny?
And who's Sophie's dad?

11:49.977 --> 11:51.678
Sophie and Audra
are best friends,

11:51.711 --> 11:52.746
and they go to ballet together.

11:52.780 --> 11:54.181
Chuck is her dad.

11:54.214 --> 11:56.083
-Chuck Reynolds.
-Why don't I know
Chuck Reynolds?

11:56.116 --> 11:58.351
-And why does his car
smell funny?
-Well, he's a mechanic,

11:58.385 --> 12:00.687
so it probably
just smells greasy.

12:00.720 --> 12:02.122
Can I be excused?

12:02.155 --> 12:03.590
IRENE:
Listen, no video games
until after your homework

12:03.623 --> 12:04.825
is finished tonight.

12:08.962 --> 12:10.931
You know, it's like
he's not even here.

12:10.964 --> 12:12.766
Oh! Like father, like son.

12:12.800 --> 12:14.034
Hey. I'm here.

12:14.067 --> 12:15.936
Hmm. Not like you used to be.

12:17.137 --> 12:19.039
Let's meet the Reynolds family.

12:19.072 --> 12:22.575
(chuckles) Well, it's just
Chuck and Sophie, uh...

12:22.609 --> 12:25.045
His wife passed away
a few years ago.

12:25.078 --> 12:27.547
Okay.
Dinner later this week?

12:27.580 --> 12:29.883
-(chuckles): Oh, God.
-What?

12:29.917 --> 12:32.619
It doesn't hurt to have a friend
who's a mechanic, baby, right?

12:32.652 --> 12:34.387
(laughs)

12:34.421 --> 12:36.423
Save the charm for court, E.

12:47.868 --> 12:49.569
-(door bells jingle)
-(Hawaiian music playing)

12:49.602 --> 12:51.571
Aloha.

12:51.604 --> 12:54.407
-Yeah.
-How may I help you?

12:54.441 --> 12:56.743
Got a voice mail from WRCW.

12:56.776 --> 12:58.745
Said I won
a free trip to Hawaii.

12:58.778 --> 13:00.080
You lucky son of a gun--

13:00.113 --> 13:02.950
if WRCW called you,
that means that you're

13:02.983 --> 13:05.252
one of our lucky
Aloha Adventure winners.

13:05.285 --> 13:06.920
What's your name?

13:06.954 --> 13:10.657
Jeff Skadden. Two Ds.

13:10.690 --> 13:11.992
Double Ds.

13:12.025 --> 13:13.093
More of a C-cup man myself.

13:13.126 --> 13:14.761
(laughs)
Here you go.

13:14.794 --> 13:17.097
Sure, we've been trying
to track you down.

13:17.130 --> 13:19.867
Well, congratulations!

13:19.900 --> 13:21.902
You've been served.
See you in court.

13:25.538 --> 13:28.775
-Ain't gonna happen.
-Hold on. Jeff.

13:28.808 --> 13:30.878
I could care less what you do,

13:30.911 --> 13:32.612
but if you fail to appear,

13:32.645 --> 13:34.181
they're just gonna
issue a warrant

13:34.214 --> 13:35.448
and you'll be running
from bounty hunters

13:35.482 --> 13:36.950
for the next decade.

13:36.984 --> 13:38.685
And once they find out that
you're an attempted rapist--

13:38.718 --> 13:40.187
well, let's just say

13:40.220 --> 13:42.722
they won't be serving you
a delicious mai tai.

13:43.756 --> 13:45.758
My advice?

13:46.826 --> 13:48.295
You just want
to get this over with.

13:48.328 --> 13:50.730
(Hawaiian music continues)

13:54.401 --> 13:55.368
(door bells jingle)

13:55.402 --> 13:56.836
(sighs)

13:56.870 --> 13:59.639
What ever happened
to being polite?

13:59.672 --> 14:00.740
Northwestern.

14:00.773 --> 14:02.842
(chuckles)

14:02.876 --> 14:05.145
I'm so proud of you.

14:05.178 --> 14:07.014
I've gotten a number of offers
from the private sector,

14:07.047 --> 14:09.049
but I just feel like
this is where I belong.

14:09.082 --> 14:10.217
If there's a place here for me.

14:10.250 --> 14:11.684
Of course there is.

14:11.718 --> 14:13.653
But are you sure you want
criminal law?

14:13.686 --> 14:16.656
It just... It takes a toll.

14:16.689 --> 14:17.891
It does?

14:17.925 --> 14:20.193
You make it all seem
so effortless.

14:20.227 --> 14:22.762
Just the violence
in most of these cases,

14:22.795 --> 14:26.666
the pain of the victims,
it can wear on you.

14:26.699 --> 14:29.402
And when I'm not trying
to put criminals away,

14:29.436 --> 14:32.105
I'm being publically attacked
for being corrupt,

14:32.139 --> 14:35.075
a liar, ineffective,

14:35.108 --> 14:38.678
when all I really want to do is
just bring justice to victims.

14:38.711 --> 14:41.581
Every time Susan Alders
attacks you on TV,

14:41.614 --> 14:43.383
my blood boils.

14:43.416 --> 14:44.784
You're my hero.

14:46.153 --> 14:47.354
You really are.

14:47.387 --> 14:50.557
You have no idea how much
that means, coming from you.

14:50.590 --> 14:52.059
It is an honor to welcome you

14:52.092 --> 14:53.426
to the state's attorney's
office.

14:53.460 --> 14:55.628
And if you have some interest

14:55.662 --> 14:59.632
in politics, well, you could
always moonlight on my campaign.

14:59.666 --> 15:01.935
Really? (chuckles)

15:01.969 --> 15:03.703
I would love that.
How is it all going?

15:03.736 --> 15:04.871
Great.

15:04.904 --> 15:06.039
I don't know.

15:06.073 --> 15:08.708
It's politics. (chuckles)

15:08.741 --> 15:10.043
Welcome to the team.

15:10.077 --> 15:11.444
Thank you.

15:11.478 --> 15:12.980
Oh.

15:13.013 --> 15:15.282
(chuckles)

15:15.315 --> 15:16.583
Oh, gosh.

15:16.616 --> 15:17.884
Can't wait. (chuckles)

15:17.917 --> 15:19.386
BELLOWS:
I'm very excited about this.

15:19.419 --> 15:21.721
I'm so, so impressed
with what you've done.

15:21.754 --> 15:23.756
(indistinct chatter)

15:26.593 --> 15:28.428
I left the bar to go out back,

15:28.461 --> 15:29.796
then she attacks me
with a knife,

15:29.829 --> 15:31.398
just like that.
Sliced my neck.

15:31.431 --> 15:32.465
You're a liar!

15:32.499 --> 15:34.901
There will be no outbursts
in my courtroom.

15:34.934 --> 15:37.070
-Counselor?
-We're fine, Your Honor.

15:37.104 --> 15:38.338
Wasn't Tamara defending herself

15:38.371 --> 15:40.073
-from your advances?
-JEFF: Hey, hey, let me talk

15:40.107 --> 15:41.574
-to you for a minute.
-TAMARA: Don't touch me.

15:41.608 --> 15:42.675
(Tamara screams)

15:42.709 --> 15:44.577
No. She was crazy.

15:44.611 --> 15:46.980
-No! (screams)
-(grunts)

15:47.014 --> 15:49.149
He's crazy.
Your Honor, he's a rapist,

15:49.182 --> 15:51.151
-and you got to believe me!
-That's enough,

15:51.184 --> 15:53.186
or I'll end
this hearing right now.

15:53.220 --> 15:55.688
Your Honor,
please forgive my client.

15:55.722 --> 15:58.191
But her anger is understandable,

15:58.225 --> 16:00.193
as Jeff Skadden
has just confirmed

16:00.227 --> 16:03.930
everything that
she's been saying for years.

16:03.963 --> 16:06.466
Tamara Folsom slashed him...

16:07.734 --> 16:09.836
...and not Tim Manning
on the night of his murder.

16:09.869 --> 16:11.804
She's not a killer.

16:11.838 --> 16:14.307
-She's a victim.
-Ms. Scott, I agree

16:14.341 --> 16:17.110
that you have produced
one of Ms. Folsom's victims,

16:17.144 --> 16:18.445
but that does not mean

16:18.478 --> 16:19.712
that she is not also guilty

16:19.746 --> 16:22.615
of ending Tim Manning's life.

16:22.649 --> 16:25.452
This testimony
demonstrates a pattern

16:25.485 --> 16:28.188
of violent aggression
towards men.

16:28.221 --> 16:30.157
Prior to that night,
she'd never been arrested

16:30.190 --> 16:32.459
or demonstrated
violent tendencies.

16:32.492 --> 16:35.695
Then, in one night, she commits
multiple acts of violence,

16:35.728 --> 16:37.697
miles apart,
within moments of each other?

16:37.730 --> 16:38.731
It's possible.

16:38.765 --> 16:40.233
Why do you refuse
to see the truth

16:40.267 --> 16:44.037
-when it is
so clearly in front of you?
-Truth is subjective, Ms. Scott.

16:44.071 --> 16:45.405
I need proof.

16:45.438 --> 16:46.739
-Motion denied.
-(gavel bangs)

16:46.773 --> 16:49.008
God, that's it?
It's over?

16:49.042 --> 16:51.544
Far from it.
We are not giving up, Tamara.

16:52.579 --> 16:54.547
Pretty terrible ruling,
if you ask me.

16:54.581 --> 16:55.982
Really terrible.

16:56.015 --> 16:58.718
And it means we only have
one option left.

16:58.751 --> 17:00.753
BOTH:
Find the real killer.

17:05.225 --> 17:08.495
(man coughing, dog barking)

17:08.528 --> 17:10.863
(man 2 shouting in distance)

17:15.302 --> 17:17.204
(bottle clinks)

17:19.272 --> 17:21.608
(man 3 murmuring)

17:32.319 --> 17:33.720
Hey, sis.

17:37.490 --> 17:38.891
There's a warrant out for you.

17:45.965 --> 17:47.867
I screwed up.

17:47.900 --> 17:49.636
You remember our promise?

17:49.669 --> 17:51.871
No matter how bad it gets,
no matter how much you want it,

17:51.904 --> 17:53.740
you reach out, we talk.

17:53.773 --> 17:55.808
How was I supposed to talk
to you about Rosemary?

17:55.842 --> 17:57.910
I lied to you for so long.

17:57.944 --> 17:59.379
Why?

17:59.412 --> 18:00.947
Why'd you lie to me?

18:00.980 --> 18:02.982
How long were you together?

18:04.251 --> 18:05.552
A few months.

18:05.585 --> 18:07.654
We didn't tell anybody

18:07.687 --> 18:10.323
because we knew
that it was wrong.

18:10.357 --> 18:12.292
(sighs)

18:12.325 --> 18:14.261
So that night at the campsite...

18:15.828 --> 18:18.398
...when Rosemary hooked up
with Tobey Kissell...

18:18.431 --> 18:20.433
(indistinct chatter, laughter)

18:21.834 --> 18:23.270
Okay.

18:25.872 --> 18:27.874
Yeah, I was upset.

18:32.179 --> 18:34.113
But I didn't...

18:34.147 --> 18:36.316
-I didn't kill Rosemary.
-That was the prosecution's

18:36.349 --> 18:38.818
entire case, Levi.

18:38.851 --> 18:40.086
And now I'm finding out

18:40.119 --> 18:41.588
-it was actually true.
-Maddie, look at me.

18:41.621 --> 18:43.356
I would never kill her.
I loved her.

18:43.390 --> 18:45.992
You think
that I killed Rosemary?

18:46.025 --> 18:48.295
I don't know
what to think anymore.

18:51.498 --> 18:54.066
I'll take care
of the bench warrant.

18:56.469 --> 18:58.471
Okay?
Just be at court next week.

18:59.806 --> 19:01.341
(sighs)

19:01.374 --> 19:04.244
Don't screw this up.
This is serious now.

19:05.312 --> 19:07.447
I promise.

19:07.480 --> 19:09.649
We'll get you cleaned up, okay?

19:14.421 --> 19:15.388
MAYFELD:
We've conducted

19:15.422 --> 19:16.789
flash polls every week

19:16.823 --> 19:18.458
since you announced
your candidacy,

19:18.491 --> 19:20.860
-and we're trending.
-Downwards.

19:20.893 --> 19:22.962
Yes, but biggest drop came

19:22.995 --> 19:25.465
after Madeline Scott
attacked you on television.

19:25.498 --> 19:27.867
-So we're tied together.
-Exactly.

19:27.900 --> 19:31.371
-She attacks, you fall.
-We need to attack her back.

19:31.404 --> 19:33.573
-Let's go negative.
-She's not even my opponent.

19:33.606 --> 19:35.174
-Well, she's going negative
on you.
-The last thing I want

19:35.208 --> 19:37.210
for my campaign is for it
to become about Madeline Scott.

19:37.244 --> 19:39.145
I don't think you have a choice.

19:39.178 --> 19:40.647
That's one of
the most famous cases

19:40.680 --> 19:42.315
in the country, Mr. Bellows.

19:42.349 --> 19:43.550
She's right.

19:43.583 --> 19:45.485
Madeline Scott
drives your numbers.

19:45.518 --> 19:46.786
It's an issue.

19:47.854 --> 19:49.856
So we'll double down on crime,

19:49.889 --> 19:53.159
making the context her case.

19:53.192 --> 19:55.061
Can you all excuse us
for a moment?

20:00.933 --> 20:02.869
What the hell
is Isabel doing here?

20:02.902 --> 20:04.404
I like having her around.

20:04.437 --> 20:05.872
Well, I don't,
and you know that.

20:05.905 --> 20:07.574
So you want me to fire her?
That'd be great for my numbers.

20:07.607 --> 20:08.675
Then hide her in a closet.

20:08.708 --> 20:10.443
Right, honey,
I'll just hide her in a closet.

20:10.477 --> 20:12.011
You need to grow a pair.

20:12.044 --> 20:13.613
Madeline Scott threatens
your campaign.

20:13.646 --> 20:15.348
We need to go negative.

20:15.382 --> 20:18.418
It'll backfire. Too many people
see her as a victim.

20:18.451 --> 20:21.988
Then find a way to do it without
leaving your fingerprints.

20:25.558 --> 20:27.294
("I'm Still the Same Person"
by Sister Crayon playing)

20:27.327 --> 20:31.431
* I thought
the gods were buildings *

20:31.464 --> 20:36.035
* Like small cities *

20:36.068 --> 20:40.940
* Her hair was never mine *

20:43.075 --> 20:44.877
(echoing laughter)

20:44.911 --> 20:49.215
* She showed me the circle *

20:49.248 --> 20:52.084
* Just the line curved *

20:53.252 --> 20:58.425
* She showed me
what death was like... *

21:01.193 --> 21:02.495
What are you doing, Maddie?

21:03.930 --> 21:05.732
This isn't gonna help anything.

21:05.765 --> 21:07.567
You see what
this is doing to Levi.

21:07.600 --> 21:10.069
He can't take it again.

21:10.102 --> 21:11.571
None of us can.

21:11.604 --> 21:14.474
Don't you know
how hard your trial was on us?

21:14.507 --> 21:15.642
On you?

21:15.675 --> 21:17.009
I am the one
who lost my best friend

21:17.043 --> 21:19.512
and ten years of my life
for something I didn't do.

21:19.546 --> 21:22.081
But look what you have done
since you have gotten out.

21:22.114 --> 21:25.518
You've turned your nightmare
into a path forward.

21:25.552 --> 21:27.153
Your brother
hasn't been so lucky.

21:27.186 --> 21:30.990
Mom, the prosecution's entire
case was based on the theory

21:31.023 --> 21:32.925
that Levi and Rosemary
had a secret relationship, so...

21:32.959 --> 21:34.193
Maddie, stop it.

21:34.226 --> 21:35.428
He lied for years,

21:35.462 --> 21:37.530
and I need to find out
what really happened,

21:37.564 --> 21:39.599
so I am not just gonna
shut this out anymore.

21:39.632 --> 21:40.933
It's over.

21:40.967 --> 21:43.436
Why can't you just move on
like the rest of us?

21:43.470 --> 21:44.771
(sobbing):
But she was my best friend.

21:44.804 --> 21:46.105
I have to go to the funeral.

21:46.138 --> 21:47.940
I'm sorry, sweetie,

21:47.974 --> 21:50.443
but no one wants you there.

21:50.477 --> 21:51.978
(sobs softly)

21:52.011 --> 21:53.746
Oh, I'm so sorry.

22:04.657 --> 22:06.659
I didn't get to say goodbye.

22:07.994 --> 22:10.963
I know, I know. Oh.

22:10.997 --> 22:13.299
(Madeline sniffles)

22:13.332 --> 22:15.368
VIOLET:
Fighting for
the wrongfully accused

22:15.402 --> 22:18.070
means dealing
with the same police officers

22:18.104 --> 22:20.473
who investigated the crime
in the first place.

22:20.507 --> 22:23.410
Sometimes we need
to find their mistakes in order

22:23.443 --> 22:26.979
-to uncover the truth.
-Yeah, he was
basically decapitated.

22:27.013 --> 22:28.214
MADELINE:
Any other suspects

22:28.247 --> 22:29.716
that you considered?

22:29.749 --> 22:31.384
Anyone in particular stand out?

22:31.418 --> 22:32.552
Yeah, there was this one.

22:32.585 --> 22:34.887
A thing that stood out
about her was

22:34.921 --> 22:36.255
she confessed.

22:36.288 --> 22:38.090
Name is Tamara Folsom.

22:40.427 --> 22:42.328
We'll run down a list
of his last known associates.

22:42.361 --> 22:43.663
-Might take...
-Hold on.

22:43.696 --> 22:46.198
The original investigation
had three detectives on it.

22:46.232 --> 22:47.934
So what happened
to the other guy?

22:49.969 --> 22:53.072
-Those jagoffs didn't even
tell me you were coming in.
-So you thought

22:53.105 --> 22:55.442
-Tamara was innocent?
-No, but I wasn't sure.

22:55.475 --> 22:57.444
After Tim Manning was killed,
I did some digging.

22:57.477 --> 23:00.346
Found something interesting:
had a girlfriend.

23:00.379 --> 23:03.550
Uh, Celeste... Adams,

23:03.583 --> 23:05.084
I think.

23:05.117 --> 23:07.554
Yeah. She was 18 at the time.

23:07.587 --> 23:10.089
Seems Tim would
periodically beat her up.

23:10.122 --> 23:12.459
-Did anyone track her down?
-No.

23:12.492 --> 23:14.861
They were so focused on Tamara,
once they got a confession,

23:14.894 --> 23:16.863
those lazy slobs
just wanted to move on.

23:16.896 --> 23:18.531
EASY:
All right. You know where

23:18.565 --> 23:21.100
-we can find Celeste?
-No idea. It's 16 years ago.

23:21.133 --> 23:23.470
There's an old photo in the
file. I don't know. Good luck.

23:23.503 --> 23:26.939
MADELINE:
Illinois employment records say

23:26.973 --> 23:29.809
-Celeste works here now.
-She's a used car salesman?

23:29.842 --> 23:33.112
-Definitely our killer.
-(laughs)

23:33.145 --> 23:36.449
Uh... Oh, I actually think
that's her.

23:36.483 --> 23:39.051
Celeste Adams?

23:39.085 --> 23:40.720
Do I know you?

23:40.753 --> 23:43.923
We need to talk
about Tim Manning.

23:45.257 --> 23:47.494
-I don't know who that is.
-We think you do.

23:49.529 --> 23:51.964
(indistinct chatter)

23:51.998 --> 23:54.801
-Who are you? What do you want?
-We're attorneys.

23:54.834 --> 23:56.569
We represent Tamara Folsom,

23:56.603 --> 23:58.404
the woman stuck in prison
for murdering Tim.

23:58.437 --> 24:00.507
I don't know
anything about that.

24:00.540 --> 24:03.075
She's spent 16 years locked up
for something she didn't do.

24:03.109 --> 24:04.511
EASY:
Police records say
you were Tim's girlfriend,

24:04.544 --> 24:08.147
and you left Illinois
immediately after he was killed.

24:08.180 --> 24:11.417
I went to Florida
'cause my mom got sick.

24:11.450 --> 24:14.020
I didn't even know Tim was dead
until a couple months later.

24:14.053 --> 24:17.857
He was a bad guy.
He used to beat me.

24:17.890 --> 24:21.093
-Well, did you call the police?
-I tried.

24:21.127 --> 24:23.362
No one listened to me.

24:24.964 --> 24:27.433
You're Madeline Scott, right?

24:27.466 --> 24:29.769
Yeah, and no one
listened to me, either.

24:29.802 --> 24:31.604
Or Tamara Folsom,

24:31.638 --> 24:34.774
who has spent 16 years in prison
for a murder she didn't commit.

24:34.807 --> 24:36.909
Sorry, I can't help you.

24:38.978 --> 24:40.780
So, what do you think--

24:40.813 --> 24:42.448
she our killer?

24:42.481 --> 24:45.217
I don't know.
She's hiding something.

24:45.251 --> 24:47.520
-Amen.
-But she recognized me.
(chuckles)

24:51.357 --> 24:52.792
We'd all like
to return to a time

24:52.825 --> 24:54.126
when our streets were safe,

24:54.160 --> 24:55.695
when hardened criminals
weren't released

24:55.728 --> 24:57.997
because of technicalities or...

24:58.030 --> 25:00.533
or flawed jurisprudence.

25:00.567 --> 25:03.002
I'm sure you all
remember the case of...

25:04.270 --> 25:06.405
...Dimitri Wright.

25:06.438 --> 25:08.407
Anyone remember that case?

25:08.440 --> 25:11.210
I was a young,
inexperienced prosecutor

25:11.243 --> 25:13.913
trying Dimitri Wright
for armed robbery.

25:13.946 --> 25:16.849
His high-paid attorney
ran circles around me,

25:16.883 --> 25:19.586
used every trick in the book,
and he was acquitted.

25:19.619 --> 25:22.254
One month later...

25:22.288 --> 25:24.757
Dmitri Wright

25:24.791 --> 25:28.561
killed a single mother
in a liquor store holdup.

25:28.595 --> 25:31.097
The poor young woman was holding
her one-year-old daughter

25:31.130 --> 25:33.232
when she was shot in the head.

25:33.265 --> 25:35.568
Her grandmother
raised the little girl,

25:35.602 --> 25:37.536
and I have stayed in touch,

25:37.570 --> 25:39.606
because I felt responsible.

25:41.373 --> 25:43.943
I'm pleased to tell you that
that little girl

25:43.976 --> 25:47.046
just graduated from Northwestern
University Law school

25:47.079 --> 25:49.381
and is our newest hire here

25:49.415 --> 25:51.884
at the Cook County
State's Attorney's Office.

25:51.918 --> 25:55.054
She serves as a reminder
of why we have laws,

25:55.087 --> 25:56.623
why we seek justice,

25:56.656 --> 25:59.125
and why I hope to become

25:59.158 --> 26:00.893
the next
Illinois attorney general.

26:00.927 --> 26:03.095
(cheering and applause)

26:03.129 --> 26:06.966
Please meet our newest
assistant state's attorney,

26:06.999 --> 26:09.602
Isabel Sanchez.

26:09.636 --> 26:11.671
(cheering and applause)

26:15.307 --> 26:18.010
Home run.

26:23.950 --> 26:25.918
(echoing laughter
and indistinct chatter)

26:30.356 --> 26:31.590
Okay.

26:35.294 --> 26:36.829
Celeste Adams is clean.

26:36.863 --> 26:38.397
No previous arrest record

26:38.430 --> 26:41.233
and no accusations of violence.

26:41.267 --> 26:42.769
Everything all right?

26:43.803 --> 26:46.438
If Levi and I were retried
for Rosemary's murder,

26:46.472 --> 26:48.174
could we be tried separately?

26:48.207 --> 26:50.609
Probably. Why?

26:50.643 --> 26:52.178
(sighs)

26:52.211 --> 26:53.680
He lied.

26:53.713 --> 26:57.016
To me, to the jury, to everyone.

26:57.049 --> 26:59.852
He just told me he was
in a relationship with Rosemary.

26:59.886 --> 27:01.387
He's been lying for years.

27:02.889 --> 27:04.190
So?

27:04.223 --> 27:07.526
So?
That doesn't faze you?

27:07.559 --> 27:09.328
I always suspected he was lying.

27:09.361 --> 27:11.163
And that doesn't bother you?

27:11.197 --> 27:14.166
I represented you, Madeline.
Levi had another lawyer.

27:14.200 --> 27:17.737
If he committed perjury...
not my problem.

27:21.874 --> 27:23.976
Do you think
Levi killed Rosemary?

27:25.011 --> 27:27.313
Just because he lied
doesn't make him a killer.

27:27.346 --> 27:29.816
Um, Madeline, it's 8:00.

27:29.849 --> 27:31.851
-(sighs): So?
-So...

27:31.884 --> 27:34.220
-you have a date right now.
-Mm... (laughs)

27:34.253 --> 27:35.722
(sighs)

27:35.755 --> 27:38.725
Aw, damn it.
I'm supposed to be home.

27:38.758 --> 27:40.326
Bye.

27:43.529 --> 27:45.998
-What are you doing?
-Uh, I'm canceling.

27:46.032 --> 27:48.067
Give it to me.
You are going on this date,

27:48.100 --> 27:50.502
and you are gonna
give me all of the details.

27:50.536 --> 27:51.904
Violet, I do not have time to...

27:51.938 --> 27:53.539
I know you're nervous
because you didn't get

27:53.572 --> 27:55.041
to make a fool of yourself
in your 20s

27:55.074 --> 27:58.677
like the rest of us, but you
need to do it in your 30s.

27:58.711 --> 28:00.913
Why?

28:00.947 --> 28:03.549
So that you can be normal
in your 40s.

28:03.582 --> 28:05.051
Have fun.

28:05.084 --> 28:08.220
And smile! He's very cute.

28:08.254 --> 28:10.056
I don't know anybody
in their 40s who's normal.

28:10.089 --> 28:11.758
Have fun. Call me.

28:11.791 --> 28:13.092
(indistinct conversations)

28:13.125 --> 28:16.595
* I live my life
on the wrong side... *

28:16.628 --> 28:19.531
I'm so sorry.
I'm so late.

28:19.565 --> 28:22.068
-I'm... I'm-I'm late.
-Oh, no. Will you stop? Come on.

28:22.101 --> 28:23.870
-I'm-I'm sorry.
-Listen, I was four months late

28:23.903 --> 28:25.404
for dinner once
because I was held hostage

28:25.437 --> 28:26.739
by a small Ugandan army.

28:26.773 --> 28:29.075
How did that apology go over?

28:29.108 --> 28:30.943
Uh, oddly, not well.

28:30.977 --> 28:32.945
-(laughs)
-WAITER: The gentleman
ordered a Brachetto.

28:32.979 --> 28:34.413
Oh, uh, just a seltzer
for me, please.

28:34.446 --> 28:37.049
Are you sure, madam?
It's an excellent choice.

28:37.083 --> 28:39.018
Uh, the last time I got drunk,
I was convicted

28:39.051 --> 28:41.287
of murder and spent ten years
in a state prison,

28:41.320 --> 28:42.955
so I'm just
a party seltzer girl now.

28:42.989 --> 28:45.291
Yeah, make it two seltzers,
please. Thanks.

28:45.324 --> 28:47.794
So sorry.
I completely forgot.

28:47.827 --> 28:49.962
(sighs)
Yeah, it's a bummer, right?

28:49.996 --> 28:52.298
The first hookup without alcohol
is always so tricky.

28:52.331 --> 28:54.233
-(chuckles)
-Yeah, yeah.

28:54.266 --> 28:56.735
Uh, so...

28:56.769 --> 28:58.805
so, how are the cases coming?

29:00.106 --> 29:02.141
-Good, good. Yeah.
-Yeah?

29:02.174 --> 29:04.143
Bad, because all my clients
are in prison

29:04.176 --> 29:05.477
for crimes they didn't commit

29:05.511 --> 29:07.079
and trying not
to lose their minds,

29:07.113 --> 29:09.481
which causes all of us
to try to not lose our minds.

29:09.515 --> 29:11.818
Well, maybe you should
start drinking.

29:11.851 --> 29:12.985
Clever.
(chuckles)

29:13.019 --> 29:14.486
(chuckles) Well, I got
something funny for you.

29:14.520 --> 29:15.822
(laughs)

29:15.855 --> 29:18.157
(laughs): I didn't even say
what was funny yet.

29:19.658 --> 29:21.994
-Right. Right.
-Right.

29:22.028 --> 29:24.330
You know what?
I'm just... I'll be right back.

29:24.363 --> 29:26.265
I'm gonna run to the restroom,
but I'm gonna be so quick.

29:26.298 --> 29:28.467
It's just number one. Okay.

29:30.002 --> 29:32.338
IRENE:
You asked me to make
dinner arrangements.

29:32.371 --> 29:34.506
-You did. Not me.
-I know, and I'm sorry.

29:34.540 --> 29:36.008
We invited him over

29:36.042 --> 29:38.344
so that you could know who was
driving your daughter to ballet.

29:38.377 --> 29:39.912
So that you could have
an inkling

29:39.946 --> 29:42.181
of what was going on
in her life.

29:42.214 --> 29:44.683
I mean, it's bad enough
that you forget about us,

29:44.716 --> 29:47.419
but now you've let the whole
world know that we are still

29:47.453 --> 29:49.755
an afterthought
to the redheaded princess.

29:49.788 --> 29:52.024
Come on. This has nothing
to do with Madeline.

29:52.058 --> 29:55.027
At dinner, Chuck asked me why
your first wrongful conviction

29:55.061 --> 29:56.829
was for a white girl.

29:56.863 --> 29:59.798
Ten years later, people are
still asking me the same thing.

29:59.832 --> 30:02.201
Our prisons are filled
with our brothers and sisters,

30:02.234 --> 30:04.803
and you have given up
your career for Madeline Scott.

30:04.837 --> 30:06.438
Because hers was
the highest profile case

30:06.472 --> 30:07.874
that made the most sense.

30:07.907 --> 30:09.842
I mean, what, do you think, I'm
in love with her or something?

30:09.876 --> 30:11.210
Oh, please, I stopped worrying

30:11.243 --> 30:12.678
about that skinny little bitch
years ago.

30:12.711 --> 30:15.714
What I care about
is how you avoid your family.

30:15.747 --> 30:17.483
How you won't even
talk to me anymore,

30:17.516 --> 30:20.052
-not even about your cases.
-Because they're too painful,

30:20.086 --> 30:22.054
and I want to forget about 'em
when I get home.

30:22.088 --> 30:24.656
Okay. So why
are you even doing this?

30:24.690 --> 30:27.894
Because I'm not practicing
boring reinsurance law anymore.

30:27.927 --> 30:30.562
I have famous politicians
and reporters

30:30.596 --> 30:32.064
wanting something from me,

30:32.098 --> 30:33.900
attacking me
and trying to be my friend.

30:33.933 --> 30:35.902
I am in the game now, baby.

30:35.935 --> 30:38.905
Making a difference
in the justice system.

30:38.938 --> 30:41.908
How many black lawyers
get that chance?

30:41.941 --> 30:45.744
Now, it's gonna take
a sacrifice from all of us.

30:48.214 --> 30:51.417
I want to be a part
of your life again.

30:51.450 --> 30:54.253
We all do.

30:55.587 --> 30:57.423
I know you don't like
to hear me say this,

30:57.456 --> 30:59.225
but I really think
you need to see someone.

30:59.258 --> 31:01.393
No.

31:01.427 --> 31:03.930
Absolutely not.

31:03.963 --> 31:05.932
Well, then,
you better do something,

31:05.965 --> 31:07.799
'cause this is not working.

31:23.983 --> 31:25.884
What the...?

31:25.918 --> 31:27.954
What are you still doing here?

31:27.987 --> 31:29.956
I'm working on Tamara's case.

31:29.989 --> 31:32.458
What are you doing here? You're
supposed to be naked right now.

31:32.491 --> 31:35.127
(groans)
Worst date ever.

31:35.161 --> 31:36.963
There's something wrong
with me, Vi.

31:36.996 --> 31:39.598
-So, no second date?
-I don't know.

31:39.631 --> 31:41.433
He just texted
and asked to try again.

31:41.467 --> 31:43.469
Oh. So you have to go.

31:43.502 --> 31:46.138
-Really?
-Yes. I'm on a dating app
cleanse right now,

31:46.172 --> 31:47.974
and I'm living vicariously
through you,

31:48.007 --> 31:49.741
and I need
all the naughty details.

31:49.775 --> 31:53.312
Oh, speaking of naughty,
come here.

31:53.345 --> 31:55.381
I just found something
on Celeste Adams.

31:55.414 --> 31:56.782
I did a reverse image search,

31:56.815 --> 31:58.985
and it looks like
she has an alter ego.

31:59.018 --> 32:00.619
Celeste is an escort.

32:00.652 --> 32:03.289
Fitness techniques:
straps and B&B,

32:03.322 --> 32:04.991
which is short
for "bondage and bareback."

32:05.024 --> 32:06.658
Why do you know that?

32:06.692 --> 32:08.995
A girl has her secrets.

32:09.028 --> 32:12.931
Do a search for Tim Manning
and Sandy Ojai.

32:12.965 --> 32:15.167
VIOLET:
Oh, here we go.

32:15.201 --> 32:20.006
Sandy Ojai was picked up in a
prostitution sting 16 years ago,

32:20.039 --> 32:23.342
and she wouldn't testify
against her pimp,

32:23.375 --> 32:26.678
Tim Manning, and all
the charges were dropped.

32:26.712 --> 32:29.315
(sighs) Well, that's why
she had a clean record.

32:29.348 --> 32:31.783
She was using a different name.

32:33.385 --> 32:34.920
I think Tim Manning was murdered

32:34.953 --> 32:36.922
in some kind
of prostitution turf war,

32:36.955 --> 32:39.325
and our Ms. Ojai was
right in the middle of it.

32:39.358 --> 32:41.960
You may have just saved
Tamara's Folsom's life.

32:48.400 --> 32:50.369
(camera shutter clicking)

32:51.403 --> 32:52.638
Get started right now?

32:52.671 --> 32:53.705
(indistinct chatter)

32:53.739 --> 32:56.008
MAN:
Girls, come on,
let's get inside.

32:58.344 --> 33:00.046
(siren chirping)

33:02.081 --> 33:03.215
OFFICER (on speaker):
Keep moving.

33:03.249 --> 33:04.650
MAN:
Whoa.

33:04.683 --> 33:07.219
-OFFICER: Now.
-(sighs)

33:07.253 --> 33:09.721
Can't a guy take a picture
of hookers in peace anymore?

33:09.755 --> 33:11.757
(engine starts)

33:14.860 --> 33:16.828
BODIE:
They're using the used car
dealership as a front

33:16.862 --> 33:18.997
-for a brothel.
-That's really a thing?

33:20.099 --> 33:21.733
-Asking for a friend.
-BODIE: It is.

33:21.767 --> 33:24.002
Bars, car washes, junkyards--

33:24.036 --> 33:25.471
any cash-heavy business
is pretty common

33:25.504 --> 33:26.872
for money laundering.

33:26.905 --> 33:29.641
In this case, they're also
using it as base of operations

33:29.675 --> 33:31.210
for incoming calls.

33:31.243 --> 33:33.845
We've got Chad, the salesman
who works the front.

33:33.879 --> 33:36.715
And then there's the owner
of the car dealership,

33:36.748 --> 33:38.117
David Jackson.

33:39.351 --> 33:40.652
He's not only

33:40.686 --> 33:43.055
her pimp, he's also her husband.

33:43.089 --> 33:44.923
Marriage is a tricky business.

33:44.956 --> 33:46.258
Yeah, they got married
in Florida

33:46.292 --> 33:49.528
a few months after Tim's murder.
Short grieving period.

33:49.561 --> 33:51.363
-Very short.
-So, David kills Tim,

33:51.397 --> 33:54.266
Celeste's former pimp,
David marries her,

33:54.300 --> 33:56.602
and enslaves her
in his prostitution ring?

33:56.635 --> 33:59.205
Your mind goes to dark places.

33:59.238 --> 34:01.373
-And fast.
-So very fast.

34:01.407 --> 34:03.575
In prison I knew hundreds
of prostitutes and, sadly,

34:03.609 --> 34:05.844
this is a really common story.
They're brainwashed

34:05.877 --> 34:08.214
or enslaved by these guys,
and it's almost impossible

34:08.247 --> 34:09.915
for them to get out
of this life.

34:09.948 --> 34:11.450
EASY:
Yeah, I don't know.
Celeste doesn't

34:11.483 --> 34:12.951
seem like the type of woman
who wants

34:12.984 --> 34:14.720
to get out
or turn on her handlers.

34:14.753 --> 34:17.423
Agreed. Doesn't mean
we shouldn't try.

34:17.456 --> 34:18.890
So what's the approach?

34:21.927 --> 34:23.429
Oh, this is encouraging.

34:33.839 --> 34:35.974
Hi, Celeste.

34:36.007 --> 34:37.809
Or should I say Sandy Ojai?

34:37.843 --> 34:40.746
What are you doing here? I told
you I don't know anything.

34:40.779 --> 34:43.282
I want you to come with me
to see Tamara Folsom.

34:43.315 --> 34:46.084
Get out of my way or I'll beat
the hell out of you.

34:46.118 --> 34:49.755
If you mess with me, you're
gonna find yourself face down,

34:49.788 --> 34:51.123
bleeding on the concrete.

34:53.325 --> 34:57.296
Give me and Tamara
a few minutes.

34:57.329 --> 34:59.865
I swear I'll never
bother you again.

35:04.636 --> 35:06.172
(lock buzzes, latch clicks)

35:06.205 --> 35:07.173
MADELINE:
Celeste,

35:07.206 --> 35:09.841
this is Tamara.

35:09.875 --> 35:12.178
I know this isn't easy for you.

35:12.211 --> 35:15.214
We really appreciate you
coming down here.

35:18.384 --> 35:20.352
I didn't know.

35:20.386 --> 35:21.987
I swear. I thought
they'd never arrested

35:22.020 --> 35:25.191
anyone for Tim's murder.

35:25.224 --> 35:26.992
I'm so sorry.

35:27.025 --> 35:29.861
It's not your fault
if you didn't know.

35:29.895 --> 35:32.531
I didn't. I was just...

35:32.564 --> 35:34.966
so relieved Tim was gone.

35:36.402 --> 35:38.204
(sighs)

35:38.237 --> 35:39.571
What happened?

35:41.407 --> 35:43.309
How'd you end up with that guy?

35:44.543 --> 35:46.178
It's okay.

35:47.513 --> 35:49.014
Really, it's just us.

35:53.685 --> 35:57.055
I ran away from home
when I was 16.

35:57.088 --> 36:01.026
I met Tim, and he was nice

36:01.059 --> 36:05.163
and funny, and... I was broke.

36:06.765 --> 36:09.067
He put money down for a deposit
on an apartment and...

36:09.100 --> 36:11.537
He said that you had
to pay him back.

36:12.738 --> 36:14.673
Told me this is how it works
in Chicago,

36:14.706 --> 36:18.544
and if I didn't bring home
300 bucks a night,

36:18.577 --> 36:20.346
I'd be on the streets.

36:24.049 --> 36:25.351
You probably think I'm an idiot,

36:25.384 --> 36:29.521
but you don't know how it feels
to be so trapped.

36:29.555 --> 36:31.857
I know exactly how it feels.

36:31.890 --> 36:34.860
We both do.

36:36.762 --> 36:39.064
If I didn't make enough,
he'd beat me.

36:40.532 --> 36:43.068
I thought he was gonna kill me
until I met David.

36:44.903 --> 36:47.205
David promised
he was never gonna let Tim

36:47.239 --> 36:48.840
hit me anymore.

36:48.874 --> 36:52.043
So he and his buddy Chad
took care of him.

36:54.713 --> 36:56.147
Did they kill him?

36:58.149 --> 37:00.786
That's what you're saying?

37:04.155 --> 37:05.791
I'm real sorry for you,

37:05.824 --> 37:08.093
but David's friends
with some bad people.

37:08.126 --> 37:10.596
If I testify, they'll
come after me. I'm sorry,

37:10.629 --> 37:12.230
-I can't do this. Guard!
-Celeste.

37:12.264 --> 37:14.766
This is your chance
at a new start.

37:14.800 --> 37:16.735
Tell the truth.

37:16.768 --> 37:20.339
David and Chad will go away.
You can both finally be free.

37:27.646 --> 37:30.282
(groans)

37:30.316 --> 37:33.319
TAMARA:
That's exactly how I thought

37:33.352 --> 37:35.053
it would go.

37:35.086 --> 37:38.123
I never met a ho that didn't
look out for anyone but herself.

37:38.156 --> 37:40.058
Truth.

37:40.091 --> 37:42.428
But the good news is...

37:42.461 --> 37:44.129
now we know
exactly what happened.

37:45.163 --> 37:46.865
So?

37:48.099 --> 37:50.101
So now we have a way in.

37:55.173 --> 37:56.642
MAN:
You're gonna love the silver.
I actually knew the original

37:56.675 --> 37:58.410
owner--
kept it in top-notch shape.

37:58.444 --> 38:00.412
Right on.
That's-that's great.

38:00.446 --> 38:02.147
So, you guys live
together, or...

38:02.180 --> 38:03.815
Nah. Nah, we ain't a couple.

38:03.849 --> 38:05.351
Oh.

38:05.384 --> 38:08.019
Why-- you don't like
interracial couples?

38:08.053 --> 38:11.022
Oh, I don't care.

38:11.056 --> 38:13.191
-I didn't mean
to offend anybody.
-Oh,

38:13.224 --> 38:15.361
no, I'm not offended.
Easy?

38:15.394 --> 38:16.795
Little bit,
but I'll get over it.

38:16.828 --> 38:19.465
Easy here is actually my pimp.

38:20.499 --> 38:23.702
(laughter)

38:23.735 --> 38:27.005
Yeah, except it's not a joke.
I used to be with a guy

38:27.038 --> 38:28.974
named Tim Manning,
but Easy killed him,

38:29.007 --> 38:31.710
then married me, and I've been
working for him ever since.

38:31.743 --> 38:33.545
We launder the money
out of a bar.

38:33.579 --> 38:35.347
-I-I thought it was a junkyard.
-Car wash?

38:35.381 --> 38:37.148
All right, you're gonna
have to go now.

38:37.182 --> 38:38.850
Too late for that, Chad.
Celeste already

38:38.884 --> 38:41.286
told the cops you killed Tim,
and David is making a statement

38:41.319 --> 38:44.723
at this very moment
saying it was you.

38:44.756 --> 38:47.393
-No, he's not. You're lying.
-I wish we were.

38:47.426 --> 38:49.294
We want David because we know
he really did it,

38:49.327 --> 38:51.296
but Celeste is his wife
and she's invoking

38:51.329 --> 38:53.064
marital privilege.

38:53.098 --> 38:56.001
She can't be coerced
into testifying against him.

38:56.034 --> 38:57.403
They both seem
really comfortable

38:57.436 --> 38:58.737
pinning the whole thing on you.

38:59.771 --> 39:01.039
It's not true.

39:01.072 --> 39:03.208
Tim was a pig, but I didn't
do anything to him.

39:03.241 --> 39:04.510
That's not what David
and Celeste said.

39:04.543 --> 39:06.845
-They said you killed him.
-Two against one, Chad,

39:06.878 --> 39:08.246
and all the prosecutor
will care about

39:08.279 --> 39:09.515
is someone going down for this.

39:09.548 --> 39:11.583
I didn't have anything
to do with it.

39:11.617 --> 39:13.151
We know.
We know everything.

39:13.184 --> 39:15.086
We know David did it
because he wanted Celeste

39:15.120 --> 39:17.489
and then married her in Florida.

39:17.523 --> 39:19.024
But what we don't have
is someone

39:19.057 --> 39:20.426
willing to go on record
against David.

39:20.459 --> 39:23.061
Instead we have
David and Celeste

39:23.094 --> 39:24.430
on the record against you.

39:26.465 --> 39:28.567
I can't believe
this is happening.

39:28.600 --> 39:30.335
So unfair,

39:30.368 --> 39:32.337
but you just tell us
what David did,

39:32.370 --> 39:34.005
we'll set
the whole thing straight.

39:34.039 --> 39:35.373
We want David, not you.

39:40.045 --> 39:41.179
Okay.

39:41.212 --> 39:43.715
Okay, yeah.
Everything you said was right.

39:43.749 --> 39:45.517
David did it because Tim was
beating up on Celeste and he

39:45.551 --> 39:46.518
wanted her to be his girl.

39:46.552 --> 39:48.253
I didn't have anything
to do with it.

39:48.286 --> 39:50.422
I was just supposed to keep Tim
from getting away.

39:50.456 --> 39:51.590
David's the one that killed him.

39:53.258 --> 39:54.292
(door opens)

39:55.326 --> 39:57.062
You're under arrest.

39:57.095 --> 40:00.098
Interracial his and her wires.

40:00.131 --> 40:02.033
(Chad sighs)

40:02.067 --> 40:04.302
* I've been runnin' down
these roads for nothing... *

40:04.335 --> 40:06.538
-(indistinct chatter)
-All right.
-Let's go.

40:06.572 --> 40:09.040
Will the defendant please rise?

40:09.074 --> 40:11.042
* Shinin' back at me... *

40:11.076 --> 40:12.611
Based on newly
discovered evidence

40:12.644 --> 40:15.280
of her actual innocence,

40:15.313 --> 40:18.049
this court hereby vacates

40:18.083 --> 40:20.619
petitioner's conviction
of murder.

40:20.652 --> 40:23.655
If the state plans
to retry Ms. Folsom,

40:23.689 --> 40:25.457
-they have 20 days...
-GREEN: Your Honor, the state

40:25.491 --> 40:28.059
does not intend
to re-prosecute Ms. Folsom.

40:28.093 --> 40:30.962
-We no longer believe she took
any part in this killing.
-(mouthing)

40:33.331 --> 40:35.901
In that case, Ms. Folsom,
you are free to go.

40:35.934 --> 40:38.870
-(cheering)
-Good luck and Godspeed.

40:39.938 --> 40:41.406
Thank you so much.

40:41.439 --> 40:45.577
* You'll see you ain't
got nothing to prove *

40:45.611 --> 40:48.413
* Just know when times
get tough *

40:48.446 --> 40:50.649
* And it's all too much *

40:50.682 --> 40:52.183
* We'll fight *

40:52.217 --> 40:54.920
* We'll fight for you... *

40:54.953 --> 40:57.155
(reporters clamoring)

40:59.457 --> 41:01.960
I just want to say...

41:01.993 --> 41:04.195
I got 16 years taken from me.

41:04.229 --> 41:06.932
I got called murderer.
I got treated like

41:06.965 --> 41:10.001
I was trash,
but somebody finally listened

41:10.035 --> 41:11.670
to what I had to say.

41:11.703 --> 41:14.806
Somebody finally heard my truth.

41:14.840 --> 41:17.509
Thank you. Thank you.

41:17.543 --> 41:18.944
-Thank you.
-Ms. Folsom,

41:18.977 --> 41:20.612
one question, right here...

41:20.646 --> 41:22.648
(clamoring)

41:22.681 --> 41:24.683
VIOLET:
This week's episode is a tale

41:24.716 --> 41:28.787
of two women who never met,
but both were trapped in prison.

41:28.820 --> 41:30.288
One had her freedom taken away

41:30.321 --> 41:34.125
for no other reason
than bad luck,

41:34.159 --> 41:36.562
and another was locked
in a cycle

41:36.595 --> 41:39.831
of mental and physical abuse.

41:39.865 --> 41:41.633
What they have in common

41:41.667 --> 41:43.501
is the same monsters

41:43.535 --> 41:46.004
imprisoned them both
with their lies.

41:46.037 --> 41:47.472
Hi.

41:47.505 --> 41:48.874
VIOLET:
There's a gender bias

41:48.907 --> 41:53.011
that we see over and over again
in wrongful conviction.

41:53.044 --> 41:57.082
Men are believed
and women are ignored.

41:57.115 --> 41:59.484
And it is the burden
of hiding the truth

41:59.517 --> 42:02.353
that will tug on a person's soul

42:02.387 --> 42:05.223
or irrevocably alter
another's life.

42:05.256 --> 42:08.493
But until we can speak our truth

42:08.526 --> 42:10.495
and have another human being

42:10.528 --> 42:12.864
not just listen to us,

42:12.898 --> 42:14.432
but believe us...

42:16.401 --> 42:19.137
...we can never be truly free.

42:22.040 --> 42:26.745
* Just know when times get tough
and it's all too much *

42:26.778 --> 42:30.181
* We'll fight,
we'll fight for you *

42:30.215 --> 42:31.516
* For you *

42:31.549 --> 42:32.851
* And we'll fight *

42:32.884 --> 42:36.087
* We'll fight for you *

42:36.121 --> 42:39.758
* And we'll fight,
gonna fight for you. *

42:43.929 --> 42:46.331
I'm sorry that I didn't come
visit you sooner.

42:49.735 --> 42:52.570
I told myself I wouldn't come
until I found your killer.

42:55.641 --> 42:58.243
But the truth is
I stopped looking years ago.

43:01.680 --> 43:04.349
I just couldn't think
about it anymore.

43:07.418 --> 43:09.788
But now it's all I think about.

43:16.762 --> 43:18.296
And no matter who it is...

43:20.365 --> 43:22.033
...I swear to you
I'll find them.

You've seen the fight
for justice on Proven Innocent.

44:12.784 --> 44:15.086
Now here are a few more shows
to check out from Fox.

44:17.655 --> 44:19.424
Welcome to the galaxy.

44:20.658 --> 44:22.593
Should be fun. I'll lead.

44:24.429 --> 44:27.332
* We're breaking waves
Shooting stars *

44:27.432 --> 44:28.700
We're gonna make a run for it.

44:28.800 --> 44:29.935
* Live for glory, not forever *

44:30.035 --> 44:34.405
-Go!
-* Reach out *

44:34.505 --> 44:38.009
