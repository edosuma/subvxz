05:39.393 --> 05:40.887
Why did not these two men die?

05:41.095 --> 05:42.806
We fired at them about 50 bullets

You have the right to remain disgusting

06:58.469 --> 06:59.512

06:59.721 --> 07:01.281
You have to be careful

! (Mortis)

07:03.600 --> 07:07.645
You are the craziest, most stupid and dangerous cop I have ever seen

Please do not thank me, Lieutenant

07:09.313 --> 07:11.733
I just do my duty

Oh God, do you think he would like to talk to us?

07:17.949 --> 07:20.325
Unauthorized use of a police vehicle

07:20.535 --> 07:23.079
To endanger lives and property as a result of recklessness

Use of an irregular weapon

07:25.216 --> 07:26.707
This was my fault, sir (not wrong) Peugeot

07:26.916 --> 07:28.458
Disrespectful behavior

07:28.668 --> 07:31.587
Disrespectful and tasteless oral observations

That was me

07:32.798 --> 07:36.677
And 18 car park violations so far this month

07:36.884 --> 07:40.014
Do I need to make it clear that you are already under the control of behavior twice?

07:40.222 --> 07:44.894
This cowboy adventure this morning has made you vulnerable

07:45.060 --> 07:46.937
And you will end up in waste

07:47.146 --> 07:49.190
If you fail again

07:49.399 --> 07:52.652
Captain, this guy deserves a medal and I deserve a medal also to save him

07:52.859 --> 07:54.778
Listen, I'm aware

07:54.946 --> 07:56.614
(It was wailing though (Hurdzhug

07:56.822 --> 07:58.825
You guys have done the job that you can not

07:59.032 --> 08:01.745
So I will be more lenient with you

08:01.883 --> 08:02.922
thank you sir

08:02.954 --> 08:05.248
However you should deserve it

On the wall are 12-inch screws for the rail

08:22.308 --> 08:23.684
A teacher can be a good sports educator

08:23.892 --> 08:25.102
Be grateful that we are still working

08:25.312 --> 08:26.646
Call me Thursday

08:26.856 --> 08:27.857
(I love this work, (Roger

08:28.064 --> 08:29.775

08:29.983 --> 08:33.361
I would like to be a human target for anyone within the desirable range of donut shop

08:33.570 --> 08:35.530
There are advantages

08:37.283 --> 08:39.909
So what are your conclusions about these little adventures, Dorothy?

08:40.118 --> 08:43.205
So far we have six theft cases

08:43.414 --> 08:46.625
Two banks and a local jeweler and goldsmith

08:46.833 --> 08:49.713

09:11.777 --> 09:13.738
How many gang members do you think, Roger?

09:13.945 --> 09:15.530
I can not be sure

09:15.740 --> 09:19.036
The descriptions are always different therefore inevitably there is a group of them

09:19.244 --> 09:20.537
Maybe they turn around

09:20.745 --> 09:22.498
Sure they are the same?

09:22.705 --> 09:24.792
They have the same methodology in the way they work

09:24.999 --> 09:27.877
Two armed men

09:28.087 --> 09:29.629
They often attack in broad daylight

09:29.837 --> 09:32.257
In indifference to their personal safety

09:32.465 --> 09:34.717
Yes, when you call them do not die

09:37.176 --> 09:38.802
Some drugs give this effect

09:38.921 --> 09:40.037
Users of pentachlorophenol

09:40.062 --> 09:41.823
They can get rid of feeling all bodily injuries

09:48.608 --> 09:52.416
I (Smithers) have something for you to come to the morgue as soon as you can

09:53.320 --> 09:56.741
Have you ever wondered about the day you died, Roger?

09:56.949 --> 09:58.200
Let's assume that the day of your death

09:58.410 --> 10:01.580
On April 23 and you knew that somehow

10:01.788 --> 10:03.998
You can organize a party for your day and your death

10:04.208 --> 10:06.960
(You have gone beyond the stage of strangeness, Beglow, you are approaching the stage of deterioration

10:07.169 --> 10:08.838

10:15.511 --> 10:17.931

10:18.140 --> 10:19.432
barely

(Hello, Roger

Author: How were you?

10:28.066 --> 10:29.861
(I have a phone at home, O (Roger

10:30.068 --> 10:32.070
Using the remains of a mutilated corpse from a street

10:32.280 --> 10:34.866
As an excuse to ask about my health is not exactly

10:35.074 --> 10:37.242
What I might call thoughtful thinking

10:37.452 --> 10:39.532
She says I'm deteriorating

10:41.121 --> 10:42.373
So, what happened to this unknown?

10:42.582 --> 10:43.583
What is incredible?

10:43.790 --> 10:46.210
I will show you

10:46.234 --> 10:47.253
(A good injury, O (Roger - thanks -

10:47.462 --> 10:49.240
Is there enough to identify the body?

10:49.338 --> 10:50.716
I was wondering about the same thing

10:50.923 --> 10:52.718
It is virtually impossible to distinguish the body through teeth and fingerprints

10:52.925 --> 10:54.011
But I did not notice one thing

10:54.218 --> 10:55.679
What? - Stitches -

10:55.887 --> 10:58.307
You can see the incision that passed through the rib cage

10:58.515 --> 11:00.349
Open with an electric saw

11:00.559 --> 11:01.597
Have you undergone surgery?

11:01.684 --> 11:02.935
Both

11:03.145 --> 11:05.037
Underwent an autopsy

11:05.522 --> 11:08.150
They came here before, you guys

11:08.359 --> 11:09.944
I documented the death certificate myself

11:10.152 --> 11:11.820
I even took pictures

11:16.869 --> 11:19.537
(All of us are wrong, Dr. Smithers

11:19.747 --> 11:24.585
Dr. McNab, it is not my habit to sign a death certificate for someone who is not feeling well

11:24.793 --> 11:26.587
I hope so

11:26.795 --> 11:31.591
But the fact is that you either failed or that these two bodies woke up after you finished the autopsy

11:31.801 --> 11:33.571
And crawl out

11:33.635 --> 11:36.651
I do not forget any body, Doctor

11:40.351 --> 11:42.686
She has a beautiful future in 5 years but currently

11:42.896 --> 11:45.148
He rushed to the imaginary conclusions

11:45.356 --> 11:47.776
Without searching for the truth

11:47.984 --> 11:50.227
This is what the anatomy of your masters is

11:50.356 --> 11:51.376
Foolish

11:51.487 --> 11:52.822
What did you say? - that's cool -

11:53.030 --> 11:56.033
Yes, right? - You have to admit that it is very strange -

11:56.243 --> 11:58.352
Strange, true - about your permission -

11:58.496 --> 12:00.262
Doctor, what is this used?

12:02.417 --> 12:04.473
You would prefer not to know

12:09.925 --> 12:11.050
Duck knock

12:12.719 --> 12:15.013
Have you come to read my rights?

12:22.896 --> 12:24.761
Was it a spoon or two of sugar?

12:24.815 --> 12:27.267
Two, but I left him

12:27.651 --> 12:30.029
I thought you quit smoking, too

12:30.237 --> 12:32.531
True, but when I give up bad habit I usually get bad other

12:32.739 --> 12:34.325
lethal

12:34.534 --> 12:38.246
I came to offer my moral support

12:47.754 --> 12:49.299
Do not you think fish should swim?

12:49.508 --> 12:52.386
No, so I do not have to feed them and they are very beautiful

12:52.595 --> 12:55.098
As for the corpses, do you believe me?

12:55.306 --> 12:57.600
Surely there is something strange going on

12:57.707 --> 12:58.819
I agree

12:58.893 --> 13:04.941
Have you found anything else strange in those bodies?

13:05.150 --> 13:07.819
In addition, they do not remain dead?

13:07.820 --> 13:08.977
Yes -

13:09.028 --> 13:11.920
I found something unusual in the tissues of their skin

13:11.947 --> 13:12.910
like what?

13:13.033 --> 13:14.868
(Small amounts of sulfathiazole)

13:15.076 --> 13:16.954
It is an old product used against bacterial infections

13:17.162 --> 13:19.123
A dangerous substance

13:23.335 --> 13:25.004
Dante), for pharmaceuticals)

13:25.211 --> 13:29.008
Recent purchases were (50 kg) of sulfathiazole

13:29.216 --> 13:31.510
(Tulle you talk ya (Roger I do not know how to say this

13:31.718 --> 13:32.761
To convey the truth only

13:32.969 --> 13:38.685
We are looking for someone who kidnaps dead bodies and brings them back to life to steal jewelry stores

Good evening, police investigations (Mortis) and (Peugeot)

13:57.038 --> 14:02.961
We are sorry to interrupt your erection, yell, but we want to talk to the management of this facility

14:05.254 --> 14:08.717
For Miss James to attend the reception please

14:08.925 --> 14:10.261

14:54.140 --> 14:56.143
If you know any zombie

14:56.350 --> 14:57.601
What did you say?

14:57.811 --> 14:59.521
Is this drug usually used?

15:13.367 --> 15:16.998

15:17.205 --> 15:19.750
The material is used by everyone but nobody likes to talk about it

15:32.347 --> 15:34.589
Great, dogs get skin cancer instead

15:34.724 --> 15:36.059
(You will tell us about sulfathiazole

15:36.268 --> 15:37.351
Yeah

15:37.562 --> 15:39.856
Nothing special in it

15:40.064 --> 15:42.316
Used until the 1940s, it was replaced

15:42.524 --> 15:44.652
But we still use it

15:44.860 --> 15:47.697
As an antiseptic and herbal skin lotion

15:47.906 --> 15:50.699
I hope you do not feel resentful, but

15:50.909 --> 15:52.846
Have you ever seen these two people?

15:53.896 --> 15:55.037
Start

15:55.245 --> 15:58.041
No, I can not say I'm sorry

15:58.248 --> 16:00.335
What is that?

16:02.712 --> 16:04.047
It is sad but is also necessary

16:04.256 --> 16:06.716
When we have to kill some sick animals, we put them here

16:06.926 --> 16:08.259
The room is airtight

16:08.469 --> 16:11.971
The piston discharges the air in a few seconds

16:12.180 --> 16:14.725
The animal dies quickly and quietly

16:14.934 --> 16:17.603
Is not there one same in the (Disneyland)?

16:17.811 --> 16:19.146
That's it, sir

16:19.354 --> 16:21.356
I hope that what I have given you is useful

16:21.565 --> 16:23.275
What is there?

16:24.361 --> 16:26.072
Toxic waste products

16:26.279 --> 16:29.283
Being disposed of conveniently assure you

16:29.491 --> 16:31.244
We are done

16:31.451 --> 16:34.287
Miss (James), to spend my need it is urgent

16:34.497 --> 16:35.790
Is there a bathroom here?

16:35.997 --> 16:38.084
I have to urinate

16:38.291 --> 16:40.044
In the last gallery

16:40.252 --> 16:41.878
Just give me moments

16:59.799 --> 17:04.663
<font color = "# ff8000"> Hazardous chemicals, only authorized personnel are allowed access </ font>

17:05.190 --> 17:07.457
No entry, this is empty talk

17:58.877 --> 18:01.017
what the hell?

18:16.063 --> 18:17.356
(Thanks for all your efforts, miss

18:17.563 --> 18:19.067
you are welcome

18:21.192 --> 18:23.862
Listen, about my colleague, he

18:24.070 --> 18:25.279
primary human?

18:26.741 --> 18:28.867
Yes, but a primitive primitive man

18:29.077 --> 18:30.078
There is nothing wrong

18:30.285 --> 18:31.618
The world is full of these

18:36.257 --> 18:37.648
!No

18:39.484 --> 18:41.395
!sorry

18:50.365 --> 18:51.474
!Hey you

18:51.683 --> 18:52.810
!wait

19:12.747 --> 19:14.124
What is this creature?

19:14.333 --> 19:15.517
It is very ugly

19:32.137 --> 19:33.369

21:30.476 --> 21:31.905
What happened, Doug?

21:32.019 --> 21:35.648
I heard on the radio that there was shooting

21:35.856 --> 21:37.992
Doug), Ayna (Roger)?)

21:39.571 --> 21:40.853
...lhave

21:41.865 --> 21:45.252
Arrested in a decompression room

21:47.328 --> 21:50.741
He died like a lab dog

21:52.625 --> 21:56.504
If I could open the dreaded door

21:56.713 --> 21:58.881
(I have to see him, Doug

22:00.883 --> 22:04.930
(You think you're indestructible, O (Roger

22:05.931 --> 22:08.809
What exactly happened here, Doug?

22:09.017 --> 22:12.021
Forget it (Becky), you will not believe me

22:12.228 --> 22:13.529
try me

22:33.043 --> 22:36.172
(They must have used sulfathiazole as a preservative

22:36.379 --> 22:38.049
So they get them out of here

22:38.256 --> 22:41.801
Becky), can we leave, please?)

22:44.905 --> 22:48.649
Name of deceased: (Roger Mortis), Time of death: 45: 11 Cause of death: suffocation </ font>

22:52.980 --> 22:55.108
(So ​​they do it, (Doug

22:55.317 --> 22:58.904
Thus live the dead

22:59.111 --> 23:00.686
you are joking

23:03.534 --> 23:05.211
<font color = "# ff8000"> Place the body on the table </ font>

23:09.247 --> 23:11.900
It seems to be in good condition

23:12.083 --> 23:13.282
(He's dead, O (Becky

23:13.622 --> 23:14.629
(It does not matter, O (Doug

23:14.837 --> 23:16.839
Someone found a way to activate dead tissue

23:17.047 --> 23:19.007
The same way that new limbs of the star of the sea grow

23:19.217 --> 23:21.761
In the end, what separates life from death?

23:21.969 --> 23:24.805
But what about the soul, O Becky?

23:25.014 --> 23:29.060
Apparently they (they also found a solution to that, Doug

23:31.396 --> 23:35.275
And if he wakes up like a crazy fool?

23:36.360 --> 23:39.072
Then I hope to shoot him in the head

23:39.281 --> 23:40.406
Thank you so much

24:26.247 --> 24:27.525
Hello guys

24:29.207 --> 24:30.334
!you are alive

24:30.542 --> 24:32.919
Of course I am alive

24:33.128 --> 24:36.423
I must have received many doses

24:37.382 --> 24:39.177
(Listen, Roger

24:39.343 --> 24:40.553
Roger (How do you feel?)

24:40.762 --> 24:41.954
I feel

24:44.890 --> 24:46.850
What is this place?

24:47.727 --> 24:48.978
What are you doing here, Rebecca?

24:49.186 --> 24:53.650
Roger (we'll explain later) But please tell us what you feel

24:55.276 --> 24:58.489
... After thinking about it, I

24:58.697 --> 25:00.605
I feel great

25:01.742 --> 25:03.608
I feel very comfortable

25:04.244 --> 25:07.185
It is wonderful to be alive

25:09.666 --> 25:11.711
! Mortis) I thought you were dead)

25:11.919 --> 25:14.090
Sorry to disappoint you, Doctor

25:14.298 --> 25:17.551
What else do you remember?

25:17.759 --> 25:19.386
Well, we were

25:20.846 --> 25:24.974
We took a look at the research headquarters

25:26.727 --> 25:30.204
And (Dog), was fighting that creature

25:31.357 --> 25:34.193
I was locked in that room, and

25:34.401 --> 25:36.945
I think he fainted

25:38.824 --> 25:43.954
It was as if I were pushing into this strange light or something

25:44.161 --> 25:47.373
I looked down and saw myself

25:47.582 --> 25:48.612
physical

25:50.502 --> 25:52.468
I was lying there

25:54.213 --> 25:57.634
I extended my hand to touch it, and it was

25:57.842 --> 26:01.387
As if I had been hit by 10,000 volts

26:01.596 --> 26:04.267
It is unusual but it happened before

26:04.476 --> 26:07.270
Clinically deceased people return to life at the last possible moment

26:07.479 --> 26:08.963
(An hour passed on the death of Roger

26:08.978 --> 26:09.814
What?

26:10.023 --> 26:14.464
Do not you realize? We have already prepared him for life

26:14.509 --> 26:15.571
Gosh

26:15.653 --> 26:16.813
What is the matter?

26:18.490 --> 26:19.867
I did not find a pulse

26:20.075 --> 26:21.493
Do not be silly

26:21.702 --> 26:23.828
Can I borrow your headset, please?

26:36.384 --> 26:38.844
It is clear that this headset is not working

26:39.053 --> 26:40.680
Give me that

26:40.889 --> 26:42.681
This thing does not work, huh?

26:52.527 --> 26:53.872
You make it up

26:53.944 --> 26:55.069
He makes it up

26:55.946 --> 27:00.118
I do not know what's going on here, but I want Mortis to return (to the laboratory for some analysis)

27:00.326 --> 27:02.788
He does not need analysis, he's dead

27:02.995 --> 27:04.580
!dead

27:04.790 --> 27:06.207
This is ridiculous

27:06.235 --> 27:08.090
Becky), we both saw that man (the owner of the hideous face)

27:08.167 --> 27:09.835
It looked much worse

27:10.044 --> 27:13.173
This is crazy I have not felt better in my whole life

27:13.380 --> 27:15.092
It is hard to believe without a pulsating heart

27:15.300 --> 27:17.636
Dr. Smithers, I have two bodies in the next room

27:17.844 --> 27:19.471
I doubt that they will return to life

27:19.680 --> 27:20.681
You know where you find me

27:20.889 --> 27:23.643
After you finish this farce

27:23.851 --> 27:25.168
Gosh

27:27.687 --> 27:29.689
Oh my God, your body is cold

27:42.120 --> 27:43.913
what the hell?

27:49.044 --> 27:52.673
Why did not I bleed?

27:58.763 --> 28:00.139
Moment

28:00.348 --> 28:02.967
I'm not dead I'm more energetic than you

28:04.270 --> 28:07.857
Roger), thanks to the revival machine)

28:08.064 --> 28:09.817
I still can not believe this

28:10.024 --> 28:12.486
Sorry, Doug, but I still can not believe it

28:12.695 --> 28:15.030
You will overcome it (as time goes by, Roger

28:15.238 --> 28:16.657
It is the perfect way of life

28:16.865 --> 28:17.950
It is easy for you to say that

28:18.157 --> 28:20.286
Roger), did not hear the worst of it)

28:20.494 --> 28:22.996
(I'm dead, Rebecca) How bad can things get worse?

28:23.205 --> 28:25.124
View the lab report

28:25.331 --> 28:28.252
The rehabilitation process has a benign side view

28:28.293 --> 28:29.304
What is the?

28:29.379 --> 28:32.210
Gradual decomposition of tissues returned to life

28:32.381 --> 28:33.716
Damage to untreated cells

28:33.925 --> 28:36.635
You have about 10 to 12 hours, max

28:36.845 --> 28:38.053
so what?

28:39.723 --> 28:43.910
All your body cells will degrade and turn into organic soup

28:45.605 --> 28:48.816
Becky), can not you return it (again using the machine?

28:49.024 --> 28:52.154
This machine is not (Toaster, O (Doug

28:52.361 --> 28:55.032
Back to the laboratory Maybe we can do something

28:55.239 --> 28:58.117
The most important thing for me now

28:58.327 --> 28:59.879
He is the Nile who made this me

29:00.077 --> 29:01.495
You understand that, do not you?

29:01.704 --> 29:04.749
(Personally, I will grab his heart with my bare hand, Roger

29:04.957 --> 29:07.335
I hold his heart in the palm of my hand

29:07.543 --> 29:09.879
And watching his heart stop throbbing together

29:10.088 --> 29:13.132
(That's good, Doug, but let's find it first

29:13.342 --> 29:14.886
from where we start?

29:16.011 --> 29:17.472
(To find out) Randy James

29:17.494 --> 29:18.444
(Roger)

29:18.514 --> 29:19.598
We'll meet you in the lab

29:19.807 --> 29:21.100
You have 12 hours to 10

29:21.308 --> 29:22.851
Do not waste it

29:23.728 --> 29:25.562
Do you know what is strange about it

29:25.771 --> 29:26.940
I feel fine

29:27.147 --> 29:29.399
I feel that I can participate (in the Boston Marathon)

29:29.609 --> 29:31.963
(Can not you) Roger dead can not participate

29:32.143 --> 29:33.764
Do you think they are checking?

29:33.904 --> 29:36.282
They are very strict now

29:41.549 --> 29:42.609
Bad

29:42.748 --> 29:44.083
What is the matter?

29:44.292 --> 29:45.626
Find me a pharmacy

29:45.835 --> 29:47.653
I have to fix my face

29:56.804 --> 29:58.973
What color did you choose?

30:01.142 --> 30:02.185
Purple wine

30:02.395 --> 30:04.562
It's a good choice

30:04.772 --> 30:06.959
Highlights the color of your eyes

30:07.033 --> 30:08.108
Go to the hell

30:09.818 --> 30:11.111
I left a spot

30:11.146 --> 30:11.987
Where?

30:12.362 --> 30:13.128
Here

30:13.197 --> 30:14.906
Do not touch it, it will spill

30:15.116 --> 30:18.160
I love it when you get angry

30:19.160 --> 30:21.330
How do women do this?

30:21.538 --> 30:24.457
I do not know, it may be genetically

30:31.216 --> 30:33.004
She looks guilty to me

30:35.304 --> 30:36.973
I left without a farewell word - let me -

30:37.180 --> 30:40.560
Are you going on a trip? - Is this your business? -

30:40.767 --> 30:41.811
what happened to you?

30:42.019 --> 30:43.061
I injured myself while shaving

30:43.270 --> 30:45.023
Can I ask you some questions?

30:45.230 --> 30:46.898
I do not know anything about what happened there today

30:47.108 --> 30:49.736
I got scared and left, did you understand me?

30:50.696 --> 30:53.031
Let's talk about the subject at home

30:55.784 --> 30:57.495
What a beautiful house

30:58.286 --> 31:00.330
Can you now tell us the essence of the subject?

31:00.538 --> 31:01.914
I told you

31:02.123 --> 31:04.792
I am responsible for their PR

31:05.002 --> 31:07.336
At least you are as well until you appear

31:07.546 --> 31:08.917
What if she threatened her and scared her a little?

31:09.047 --> 31:10.715
I understood

31:10.923 --> 31:12.509
You are the strict policeman

31:12.718 --> 31:14.553
And your colleague is a nice policeman

31:14.763 --> 31:18.308
Because it does not look scary as he puts lipstick

31:20.852 --> 31:23.730
Miss James, I've been locked up in that room where they kill animals and some people get lost

31:23.938 --> 31:26.983
Someone choked me who puts me in a bad mood

31:27.192 --> 31:30.399
All I want is to find it

31:33.740 --> 31:35.466
I am really sorry

31:35.992 --> 31:37.578
But I can not help you

31:37.787 --> 31:39.498
I do not know anything

31:40.373 --> 31:42.417
Stay away from my things

31:42.625 --> 31:44.502
The lady seems to be going somewhere

31:44.711 --> 31:45.836
Shorts

31:46.046 --> 31:47.631
Reveal the truth

31:47.838 --> 31:49.965
Where were you going, Miss (James)?

31:50.175 --> 31:51.218
Away from this place

31:51.426 --> 31:52.886
Hey, what's this?

31:53.969 --> 31:55.472
This is personal

31:55.680 --> 31:58.638
There must be a VCR somewhere here

31:58.934 --> 32:00.320
here we are

32:04.981 --> 32:07.443
We monitor something on the screen, Captain

32:07.651 --> 32:08.785
Oh princess

32:10.612 --> 32:14.199
This may be the last time I've ever updated you

32:14.408 --> 32:20.398
I want you to know some things I could not tell you before

32:20.718 --> 32:22.294
Look out!

32:39.686 --> 32:42.586
Are you fine? - !Yup -

32:42.742 --> 32:44.692
Do you remember the old days when weapons killed people?

32:45.023 --> 32:47.576
You just feel jealous! That's all

32:50.363 --> 32:51.407
Go to the door

32:51.573 --> 32:52.703
when?

32:53.659 --> 32:54.660
!right Now

33:07.255 --> 33:11.385
Where does this lead us? - To the outer courtyard -

34:23.170 --> 34:24.213
Damn

34:51.283 --> 34:53.619
This is really very nasty

35:01.711 --> 35:03.671
What is going on?

35:03.880 --> 35:05.799
There seems to be someone who wants you dead

35:06.007 --> 35:07.010
They were too successful, too

35:07.049 --> 35:08.968
But why, I did not do anything

35:09.176 --> 35:11.887
Maybe because of what you know - I do not know anything at all -

35:12.097 --> 35:16.253
I was only a guide for visitors and a writer for press releases

35:17.478 --> 35:21.677
Roger (I was immersed in the jacuzzi) for 5 minutes continuously

35:22.150 --> 35:23.984
Yes right

35:24.192 --> 35:27.821
Do you teach me to do this with my girlfriend?

35:29.574 --> 35:30.699
Curse

35:32.160 --> 35:33.202
they died

35:34.871 --> 35:37.426
They always die because of me

35:38.623 --> 35:40.377
There were compelling circumstances

35:40.585 --> 35:44.797
"You do not understand the fish" The ruby ​​devil was my favorite

35:45.006 --> 35:46.885
Everything I love always dies

35:48.927 --> 35:53.350
Princess, I hope you have understood what I was trying to tell you

35:53.515 --> 35:54.516
I knew that man

35:54.726 --> 35:58.795
For more questions, contact my lawyer

36:00.482 --> 36:02.442
... and always remember how much

36:04.194 --> 36:06.905
How extraordinary you are

36:06.951 --> 36:08.056
(This is Arthur Ludermilk

36:08.198 --> 36:09.741
Did not he die?

36:09.950 --> 36:11.159
two weeks ago

36:13.829 --> 36:15.038
he is my father

36:18.125 --> 36:20.794
Hey, why are not you dead?

36:21.003 --> 36:22.004
Or even hurt?

36:22.212 --> 36:24.006
It's a fairly long story

36:25.048 --> 36:26.592
They can not kill me

36:26.801 --> 36:28.010
I'm already dead

36:28.220 --> 36:31.680
I'm a body walking just like those killers

36:31.889 --> 36:33.683
This is ridiculous I can not accept it

36:33.891 --> 36:37.270
You will have to accept this

36:41.192 --> 36:42.568
(Listen, Miss

36:44.821 --> 36:46.905
We need your help

36:48.699 --> 36:51.578
I think you need our help too

36:54.038 --> 36:55.322
I beg you

36:57.959 --> 36:59.054
OK

37:01.879 --> 37:06.901
My father used Dante Laboratories (for his experiments)

37:08.303 --> 37:10.930
All he cares about

37:11.140 --> 37:14.685
Mosquitoes into microchips have researched them for it

37:14.893 --> 37:17.689
So, who financed the revival machine? - !No -

37:17.896 --> 37:21.526
This is not true - use some bodies to steal jewelry shops -

37:23.110 --> 37:24.274
Speak

37:24.945 --> 37:27.322
Last week I went to hand over

37:27.531 --> 37:31.369
Sulfathiazole), to a man called (thiol), in Chinatown)

37:31.577 --> 37:32.621
Where in Chinatown?

37:32.829 --> 37:33.956
Do you want me to write down the address?

37:34.164 --> 37:35.457
You do not have to do this will accompany us

37:35.665 --> 37:37.083
Forget it I know my rights

37:37.292 --> 37:39.212
Sure? Let me remind you in anticipation

37:39.421 --> 37:41.840
You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say may be used against you

37:42.048 --> 37:43.591
What are you doing?

37:43.799 --> 37:45.468
Currently, you are a prime suspect

37:45.677 --> 37:49.096
Do you accompany us now or wait a long time in prison?

37:50.807 --> 37:52.184
OK

37:52.391 --> 37:54.519
Roger), you must change your clothes)

37:54.728 --> 37:57.647
You should not be declared dead

37:57.855 --> 37:59.773
Maybe I have something in my closet

37:59.983 --> 38:03.571
Clothes for the unexpected night guest Miss (James)?

38:03.778 --> 38:06.656
(She is a former lover, master (Beglow

38:08.117 --> 38:10.609
A very old stud

38:50.370 --> 38:53.164
Are you okay inside, Roger?

38:54.627 --> 38:55.750
Best of all

38:58.822 --> 38:59.880
just awesome

39:06.163 --> 39:07.346
Do not say anything

39:11.808 --> 39:13.894
How many irregularities have we had this month so far?

39:14.102 --> 39:15.522
What the hell do you care about?

39:15.729 --> 39:17.206
A good view

39:18.818 --> 39:20.736
Roger), there is a restaurant here) prepares delicious egg rolls

39:20.902 --> 39:21.861
Do you eat white beans from Fu Yong Restaurant?

39:22.071 --> 39:24.211
Let's talk to that person first, then we'll eat (Doug), did we agree?

39:24.323 --> 39:27.036
I burn to eat Chinese meat dishes

39:29.619 --> 39:32.321
This is wonderful, I'm starving

39:36.002 --> 39:38.929
Good evening, investigating police investigations (Mortis) and (Peugeot)

39:38.964 --> 39:42.134
(We want to talk to Mr. (Theol please

39:44.803 --> 39:48.140
Good evening, investigating police investigations (Mortis) and (Peugeot)

39:48.348 --> 39:50.684
(We want to talk to Mr. (Theol please

40:03.822 --> 40:05.866
Listen, giant we are from the police

40:06.074 --> 40:11.163
If Thiol does not come here in 10 seconds, we'll hit some

40:13.916 --> 40:15.918
(Miss. James

40:16.128 --> 40:17.296
Oh my happiness to see you

40:17.503 --> 40:19.340
A terrible thing has happened (Mr.) Theol

40:19.547 --> 40:20.549
Yes I know

40:20.757 --> 40:23.802
Are the detective police your friends?

40:24.010 --> 40:25.637
I understood this from the beginning

40:25.846 --> 40:28.849
We are looking for the guy who receives (orders from the laboratory) Dante

40:29.059 --> 40:30.559
Here you have found him

40:30.769 --> 40:32.062
How can I help you?

40:32.270 --> 40:34.936
What did Dante send you?

40:36.065 --> 40:37.733
nothing important

40:37.942 --> 40:40.611
Perhaps more important than you think

40:40.820 --> 40:43.657
If your friend makes one step he is a dead man

40:43.864 --> 40:48.578
Life and death are expressions of the same eternal spirit

40:48.786 --> 40:50.914
You have to write the paper that is placed in fortune cookies, yell

40:50.998 --> 40:53.616
Let me make it clear to you

41:37.422 --> 41:40.196
I do not understand what is happening but I suddenly lose my appetite

41:55.691 --> 41:57.484
What is that?

42:12.334 --> 42:14.579
Enough, from now on I am a vegetarian

42:15.254 --> 42:16.296
OK

42:16.505 --> 42:18.965
This little pig will go to the market

42:21.468 --> 42:22.636
It's disgusting

42:22.844 --> 42:23.965
!Get away from me

42:33.439 --> 42:34.749
you are kidding

42:34.775 --> 42:35.570
Killed by a bullet?

42:35.608 --> 42:38.070
They are not all zombies

42:51.542 --> 42:53.212
How do you fight this creature?

42:53.419 --> 42:56.465
Maybe we can drown him in sauce

43:02.721 --> 43:03.762
Woe, no

44:14.046 --> 44:16.712
I think I'll vomit now

44:17.592 --> 44:19.134
(Disappeared) Theol

44:19.342 --> 44:21.970
He did an amazing distraction, did not he?

44:22.179 --> 44:23.638
You are infected

44:27.018 --> 44:29.614
I'm really dead, Master

44:32.398 --> 44:36.195
This does not entitle you to be rude

44:44.703 --> 44:47.968
Learn, you can never find something useful until you crash the place

44:49.167 --> 44:52.295
Have you found any evidence, investigators?

45:00.762 --> 45:02.347
Zombie head of a duck

45:02.556 --> 45:03.557
What a concept

45:03.766 --> 45:05.354
This can replace the joking fun pillow tool

45:05.392 --> 45:08.144
Imagine what you can do with a search command

45:08.354 --> 45:09.939
(Dogg)

45:10.146 --> 45:11.307
(Dogg)

45:16.154 --> 45:18.535
Take a look at this

45:18.740 --> 45:20.116
Dates and first name letters

45:20.324 --> 45:23.411
? What do you think? -? APL I do not know, but the latter -

45:23.620 --> 45:25.162
(Arthur P. Ludermilk)

45:25.372 --> 45:26.663
My father

45:29.125 --> 45:31.420
Oh, you're right

45:31.628 --> 45:33.089
He died on June 12

45:33.296 --> 45:34.297
This is a list of death dates

45:34.506 --> 45:36.132
These people have recently died

45:36.230 --> 45:37.301
Who do you think they were?

45:37.509 --> 45:39.220
There is one way to know

45:57.239 --> 45:59.449
You sew well

45:59.657 --> 46:01.867
Just hope you do not get an infection

46:04.204 --> 46:06.916
I will risk

46:14.382 --> 46:15.632
After you

46:15.841 --> 46:16.925
Thank you

46:17.135 --> 46:19.012
So, this is what the library looks like?

46:19.219 --> 46:22.106
You know, in my life I have not seen a library from inside?

46:26.145 --> 46:27.354
OK

46:27.563 --> 46:29.314
These should cover the dates listed

46:29.523 --> 46:31.233
I got the month of March

46:33.361 --> 46:36.990
Surprisingly, the people I met in the past three months have never heard of

46:37.198 --> 46:41.453
(This one, George Nelson Canfield King of Jeans cloth

46:41.660 --> 46:44.830
The inventor of ultra slim blue jeans

46:45.040 --> 46:46.540
He died on 12 February

46:46.750 --> 46:48.459
Crush - what's up? -

46:48.668 --> 46:51.045
The Lakers won yesterday but narrowly

46:51.254 --> 46:54.049
I bet ten dollars on that game by winning by a big margin

46:55.258 --> 46:56.676
Here is another one

46:56.885 --> 46:59.305
Oliver Lang), a genius)

46:59.345 --> 47:00.221
He died March 4th

47:00.431 --> 47:01.307
Here's another

47:01.514 --> 47:05.269
Howard Davidson (commodity broker) died on April 3

47:05.477 --> 47:07.020
Do you see any link?

47:07.897 --> 47:09.981
All of them as a group of bisexual in my opinion

47:10.191 --> 47:13.027
I think everyone has big bank accounts when he dies

47:13.234 --> 47:15.237
All of them are rich dead What does it mean?

47:15.447 --> 47:16.490
I'm not sure

47:16.699 --> 47:19.367
But your father seems to be one of the victims

47:19.577 --> 47:21.928
This is crazy

47:23.498 --> 47:27.627
In any case this is not a normal issue

47:29.086 --> 47:33.174
They can cancel the obituary

47:40.766 --> 47:44.978
Rouge (What's up, man?) You seem to be suddenly alarmed

47:45.979 --> 47:47.523
These are the helpers

47:48.648 --> 47:52.152
Add new deaths all the time

47:52.171 --> 47:53.318
They will write my obituary

47:53.445 --> 47:55.530
Calm down your fear

47:55.739 --> 47:56.864
(Roger Mortis)

47:58.449 --> 48:02.454
Husband without wife and father without children

48:02.662 --> 48:06.376
Who had always thought he would die a hero

48:06.388 --> 48:07.431
(Roger)

48:08.337 --> 48:10.463
I have to leave here

48:10.856 --> 48:12.591
(Roger)

48:18.007 --> 48:19.013
! (Roger)

48:22.685 --> 48:23.810
! (Roger)

48:33.362 --> 48:36.116
(Those were a tedious chase (Roger

48:36.324 --> 48:38.618
This is fine for someone in your case

48:38.826 --> 48:42.654
I think you fit in with your position as a dead person

48:43.330 --> 48:46.709
(Your right, O Roger. We do not have time for this

48:52.424 --> 48:54.494
I can not do that

48:55.385 --> 48:58.875
I can not live an entire life in six hours

48:59.639 --> 49:02.226
(No one has all the time he needs, Roger

49:02.436 --> 49:03.485
no one

49:06.023 --> 49:07.941
Do you remember when we were in training?

49:08.149 --> 49:11.986
They have always told us that the good policeman is a living policeman

49:12.196 --> 49:14.655
This is your chance to prove that they are wrong

49:14.823 --> 49:15.952
you are good

49:16.575 --> 49:18.536
And you are dead

49:20.537 --> 49:22.497
I'm good and dead

49:24.082 --> 49:25.417
(Come on, Roger

49:25.626 --> 49:30.255
Let's find these failures and kick him in the back <font color = "# ff8000"> (we'll eliminate them) </ font>

49:30.465 --> 49:32.050
(Come on, Roger

49:32.257 --> 49:34.344
Pronounce breeches, plural

49:34.551 --> 49:35.595
Formula collection?

49:40.058 --> 49:41.267
Do you know what I heard one day?

49:41.477 --> 49:42.478
What?

49:42.685 --> 49:46.357
I heard that the world's population has grown a lot

49:46.564 --> 49:48.149
And that half of contemporary people

49:48.359 --> 49:50.319
Are still alive today

49:50.527 --> 49:52.028
Barbak - that's right -

49:52.238 --> 49:54.570
If you compare all those who have died since the beginning of history

49:55.030 --> 49:58.338
With the current population about the same number

50:00.246 --> 50:02.707
So if someone asks you when you will die

50:02.916 --> 50:04.877
You can really say, do not know

50:05.085 --> 50:06.711
So far only half has happened

50:06.921 --> 50:13.176
Not only that, if you multiply the population of Rhode Island (by the square root of my former wife's weight)

50:15.804 --> 50:18.181
Actually, you both know how to make a girl enjoy her time

50:18.390 --> 50:20.350
Welcome and patience - (Roger) -

50:20.559 --> 50:22.310
I may have some good news

50:22.520 --> 50:24.146
Rebecca Smithers (I Know You) (Randy James)

50:24.354 --> 50:27.066
Hello - are you working here? -

50:27.274 --> 50:28.735
Yes, I work here

50:28.944 --> 50:32.990
Rebecca (expert) in forensic medicine

50:33.198 --> 50:36.075
Wondrous, what a unique achievement

50:36.284 --> 50:38.412
The place is colder than usual today

50:38.619 --> 50:41.748
When will you get this nice new friend?

50:41.957 --> 50:44.376
Randy), was in charge of public relations (Dante Laboratories)

50:44.561 --> 50:45.252
I understood

50:45.459 --> 50:47.297
So what are the important news, you (Becky)?

50:47.505 --> 50:49.215
Sit on the table

50:50.174 --> 50:52.260
What a distinctive shirt to unravel

50:56.724 --> 50:58.516
Roger), came under fire)

50:58.725 --> 51:00.476
I was hoping to tell you

51:00.685 --> 51:02.312
It is amazing that you lived as long as possible

51:02.521 --> 51:04.037
So how do you feel? - A wonderful feeling -

51:04.397 --> 51:06.393
In full health

51:07.317 --> 51:09.235
Victim: (Mortis Roger

51:09.445 --> 51:13.532
Follow-up autopsy of the sixth of July, approximate time 18:45

51:13.740 --> 51:14.992
Do you have to talk through the microphone?

51:15.200 --> 51:16.368
This is not an autopsy

51:16.578 --> 51:18.246
(You're dead, Roger

51:18.373 --> 51:21.166
This is a morgue, a legitimate doctor

51:21.374 --> 51:22.529
Thank

51:23.752 --> 51:25.419
The temperature is 30 ° C

51:25.628 --> 51:28.088
The temperature gradually decreases since you passed away

51:28.298 --> 51:31.593
So, what is your opinion? How long can I live?

51:31.801 --> 51:35.013
Decomposition progresses faster than expected

51:35.220 --> 51:37.349
So it began to appear on your face

51:37.556 --> 51:40.965
I think maybe three to four hours

51:41.437 --> 51:43.022
What do I do here?

51:43.231 --> 51:45.649
Roger), I think I can provide) more time for you

51:45.859 --> 51:49.780
(And drown something in Dante's files about a special operation they were trying

51:49.988 --> 51:52.699
To extend the recovery period to more than 12 hours

51:52.907 --> 51:54.533
Can you guarantee that?

51:54.742 --> 51:55.911
No

51:56.118 --> 51:58.954
So I can not risk

51:59.164 --> 52:01.040
Rebecca), is my job)

52:01.248 --> 52:02.917
And your guest? !Gosh

52:03.126 --> 52:04.670
Did you learn anything?

52:04.878 --> 52:07.715
I spent 10 years on the street risking your life

52:07.924 --> 52:11.695
And now you are dead and this is still not enough for you

52:13.053 --> 52:15.431
I think I adore hard work

52:15.639 --> 52:17.141
What will you do next?

52:17.350 --> 52:19.226
(I'll look at the grave (Ludermilk

52:19.435 --> 52:21.144
Why not contact a lawyer (Ludermilk)?

52:21.354 --> 52:23.397
We'll go to the cemetery (and I'll meet you at home later.) Randy

52:23.606 --> 52:27.025
If you do not mind, I think I'll miss the trip to my father's last place

52:27.235 --> 52:28.404
Strongly opposed

52:28.611 --> 52:30.489
I want you next to me

52:30.665 --> 52:31.733
(Miss. James

52:34.053 --> 52:35.119
That girl loves me

52:35.328 --> 52:37.080
I can not say

52:39.706 --> 52:42.334
(I will not lose hope, Roger

52:46.880 --> 52:49.384
Go, Jorg (I'll meet you later at Randy's house

52:49.592 --> 52:50.774
OK

52:55.766 --> 52:58.017
Nice car

52:58.226 --> 53:00.520
You must earn a lot of money by cutting dead people

53:00.729 --> 53:04.358
A little early on your autopsy investigator, right?

53:04.567 --> 53:06.944
I came here to book a bag for the dead

53:07.153 --> 53:10.823
that

53:14.617 --> 53:16.162
I admire this man

53:16.371 --> 53:17.617
I can say for sure

53:33.138 --> 53:35.765
(To there on the right, (Roger

53:35.974 --> 53:38.102
Maybe I should choose a grave

53:38.310 --> 53:40.938
Do you see, do they accept payment through Mastercard

53:45.443 --> 53:48.280
Nice place to spend the rest of your age

53:48.489 --> 53:50.948
Swaying palm trees and the scent of jasmine flowers

53:51.158 --> 53:52.366
Dear neighbors

53:54.119 --> 53:55.120
(Very funny, (Roger

54:05.689 --> 54:06.885
! (Roger)

54:08.218 --> 54:09.593
What is the matter?

54:12.347 --> 54:14.093
It was a revolution

54:20.942 --> 54:22.932
What to do now? I have no key

54:24.013 --> 54:25.650
Allow me

54:26.654 --> 54:27.906
Is not that against the law?

54:28.113 --> 54:30.158
Yeah

54:52.889 --> 54:56.433
It seems to be comfortable

54:59.855 --> 55:02.899
What is your real relationship with Lauderdale, O Randy?

55:03.109 --> 55:04.317
What do you mean?

55:04.526 --> 55:09.114
(Written by Arthur P. Ludermilk) Loretta's loving husband "

55:09.323 --> 55:11.784
No mention of any dear son

55:21.253 --> 55:22.630
OK

55:25.592 --> 55:27.718
I met him at the hospital

55:28.845 --> 55:33.433
I was there for the rehabilitation of drugs and he took care of me

55:33.641 --> 55:35.559
Like his daughter who did not live in his life? - Yup

55:35.767 --> 55:36.936
Yes, he gave me a house

55:37.144 --> 55:39.438
... and gave me the position at Dante Laboratories, and

55:39.470 --> 55:41.388
I'm sure he does not know what bad place he sent me

55:41.567 --> 55:46.071
So, this zombie question was a complete surprise to you? - I swear -

55:46.279 --> 55:48.573
You believe me, do not you?

55:51.535 --> 55:55.247
It seems he left something to us

56:00.794 --> 56:03.500

57:02.820 --> 57:04.612
(He is a dog

57:18.545 --> 57:20.254
Let us bring him down

57:43.278 --> 57:44.488
Randy?)

57:46.324 --> 57:47.615
Randy?)

57:50.495 --> 57:52.038
(I'm sorry, Roger

57:55.000 --> 57:56.960
I did not want to tell you

57:57.168 --> 57:59.086
I did not think you'd understand that

57:59.295 --> 58:01.046
What are you talking about?

58:01.255 --> 58:02.362
...I

58:03.800 --> 58:06.344
Lied about drug rehabilitation

58:08.430 --> 58:11.728
... I was in hospital because I was

58:11.926 --> 58:13.018
I was dying

58:17.106 --> 58:18.483
I was dead

58:23.862 --> 58:25.323
what do you mean?

58:25.531 --> 58:29.161
Bring me back to life (just like you, Roger

58:30.369 --> 58:35.021
But they said I would live a normal life, provided I helped them

58:38.253 --> 58:39.296
Help who?

58:40.172 --> 58:41.631
They lied to me

58:42.633 --> 58:44.197
Who, O (Randy)?

59:25.178 --> 59:26.513
(I'm sorry, Roger

59:54.333 --> 59:56.305
(I'm sorry, Roger

59:57.421 --> 01:00:00.229
please forgive me

01:00:36.629 --> 01:00:38.089
(Alo, I) Rebecca

01:00:38.297 --> 01:00:39.674
Listen, Rebecca

01:00:39.882 --> 01:00:41.175
I do not exist to answer you

01:00:41.384 --> 01:00:44.758
Leave me a message and I'll get back to you not really

01:00:47.640 --> 01:00:50.142
(Rebecca), he died (Doug)

01:00:51.770 --> 01:00:53.324
Randy (died)

01:00:53.370 --> 01:00:54.522
...I wish if

01:00:56.317 --> 01:00:58.037
Really, I wish

01:01:11.331 --> 01:01:12.804
Hey

01:01:23.470 --> 01:01:27.188
Numbers parallel to letters

O

01:01:40.738 --> 01:01:43.574
Damn, those are

01:02:15.151 --> 01:02:16.276
! (Roger)

01:02:16.293 --> 01:02:17.444
what are you doing here?

01:02:17.653 --> 01:02:18.778
What do you think, (McNab)?

01:02:18.988 --> 01:02:21.114
You'll be more detailed

01:02:21.323 --> 01:02:24.577
Listen, if you want details

01:02:24.785 --> 01:02:26.120
you killed me

01:02:26.327 --> 01:02:28.039
(And killed (Dogg) and maybe you did not kill (Randy

01:02:28.215 --> 01:02:30.068
But you had to have the morality to let her stay dead

01:02:30.249 --> 01:02:32.168
What topic are you talking about?

01:02:32.377 --> 01:02:36.840
Revenge, McNab, against you unless I get quick answers

01:02:37.048 --> 01:02:39.092
But this is unreasonable I was helping you

01:02:39.300 --> 01:02:41.136
I do not think so

01:02:41.343 --> 01:02:43.846
Thinking (Ludermilk), designed a machine to revive people

01:02:44.056 --> 01:02:45.097
You've tried it, have not you?

01:02:45.307 --> 01:02:47.642
This is ridiculous

01:02:47.850 --> 01:02:49.895
Of course (you lose your right, Roger

01:02:50.102 --> 01:02:51.437
Your mind is deteriorating

01:02:51.645 --> 01:02:53.858
When you buried him alive Ludermilk), wanted to charge you)

01:02:54.067 --> 01:02:55.427
But he was afraid to write (McNab's name)

01:02:55.443 --> 01:02:57.320
For fear that it will come back and erase it

01:02:57.527 --> 01:02:59.529
So try something more subtle

01:02:59.739 --> 01:03:01.156
It's an encrypted message

01:03:01.365 --> 01:03:04.367
Using an icon inspired by phone keys

01:03:04.577 --> 01:03:06.621
This is its abbreviation

01:03:06.830 --> 01:03:08.020
Body doc <font color = "# ff8000"> Doctor of Bodies </ font>

01:03:08.457 --> 01:03:10.887
Sounds a bit like you, right?

01:03:12.126 --> 01:03:14.671
(This is what happens when you die, O Roger

01:03:14.880 --> 01:03:19.135
Your nerve points converge, leading to all kinds of crazy conclusions

01:03:19.343 --> 01:03:21.513
(My mind was never so clear, McNab

01:03:23.389 --> 01:03:24.890
As well as my correction

01:03:25.100 --> 01:03:26.434
You bastard

01:03:26.643 --> 01:03:29.812
How many other people have been buried alive, McNab?

01:03:30.020 --> 01:03:31.980
Canfield), king of blue jeans)

01:03:32.190 --> 01:03:34.399
Oliver Lang), (Howard Preston)?)

01:03:35.020 --> 01:03:38.029
Take these people's money to keep them alive, right?

01:03:38.237 --> 01:03:39.238
!this is a lie

01:03:39.447 --> 01:03:41.116
nice watch

01:03:41.325 --> 01:03:42.534
Beautiful ring, too

01:03:42.742 --> 01:03:46.079
My guess is that they belong to stolen jewelry shops

01:03:47.956 --> 01:03:48.957
Give me that

01:03:49.166 --> 01:03:51.334
When you revive these thieves you want to try them

01:03:51.543 --> 01:03:55.505
So you send them to do what they steal to steal things

01:03:55.714 --> 01:03:57.883
When I discovered all this she killed me

01:03:58.091 --> 01:04:00.137
It is an intangible evidence that will not be accepted in any court

01:04:00.344 --> 01:04:01.637
(I will not wait for any trial, O McNab

01:04:01.847 --> 01:04:02.889
! (Roger)

01:04:03.098 --> 01:04:04.182
I can help you

01:04:04.392 --> 01:04:06.435
She also helped (Randy James)?

01:04:10.606 --> 01:04:12.065
Good evening, Doctor

01:04:12.275 --> 01:04:14.109
I 've been too late.

01:04:14.317 --> 01:04:15.486
This villain almost killed me

01:04:15.533 --> 01:04:16.721
Give me a diamond ring

01:04:19.239 --> 01:04:21.742
(In fact, Roger) every action has some benefits

01:04:21.951 --> 01:04:23.869
It takes some time to find them

01:04:24.077 --> 01:04:27.414
And not all the world's money will compensate you (what will happen to you) McNab

01:04:28.542 --> 01:04:31.544
The investigator appears to be in poor condition

01:04:31.725 --> 01:04:33.371
(Not as bad as it will be, O) Theol

01:04:33.504 --> 01:04:36.091
They shut him up

01:04:37.176 --> 01:04:38.384
Thank

01:04:39.970 --> 01:04:42.514
How do you want us to kill this man?

01:04:42.722 --> 01:04:44.183
(I started to love you as my son, Roger

01:04:44.390 --> 01:04:48.811
You are honest, trustworthy and depend on you as a scout boy

01:04:52.610 --> 01:04:54.485
O irony, is not it, Roger?

01:04:54.694 --> 01:04:57.907
You will spend your last moments and inches of freedom

01:04:58.115 --> 01:04:59.574
Here in front of the morgue

01:04:59.783 --> 01:05:02.703
For this very reason, Doctor, we should not waste more time

01:05:02.911 --> 01:05:04.079
Yes, yes, put it in the truck

01:05:04.288 --> 01:05:05.821
They tied him in the side bars

01:05:12.421 --> 01:05:14.925
Please do not mind having a partner

01:05:19.262 --> 01:05:20.721
Yes, I know it's annoying

01:05:20.931 --> 01:05:23.015
But Smithers has long been a nuisance

01:05:23.225 --> 01:05:25.143
(I'll send you to hell, McNab

01:05:25.351 --> 01:05:27.771
You can not make me stay here

01:05:27.978 --> 01:05:33.026
This truck is all armored and soundproofed if you think of asking for help

01:05:33.235 --> 01:05:36.070
It is custom-made ideal biodegradable place

01:05:36.279 --> 01:05:40.032
Which I think will happen almost within 45 minutes

01:05:40.241 --> 01:05:42.911
Let 's go, Doctor, they' re waiting for us in the lab

01:05:43.120 --> 01:05:44.664
Yes, close the door

01:05:44.871 --> 01:05:46.207
close the door

01:05:46.415 --> 01:05:47.626
(Happy trip, O (Roger

01:06:06.938 --> 01:06:09.065
Rebecca), I've always thought we'd be together at the end)

01:06:09.273 --> 01:06:11.670
But never on this picture

01:06:32.715 --> 01:06:34.007
(Rebecca)

01:06:36.176 --> 01:06:37.469
you and me

01:06:42.892 --> 01:06:43.935
We will go on

01:06:45.020 --> 01:06:46.312
round

01:07:16.927 --> 01:07:18.430
Wow

01:07:18.637 --> 01:07:20.832
This would be great

01:07:40.160 --> 01:07:41.622
!Oh my God

01:08:03.685 --> 01:08:06.063
Come on, you guys

01:08:06.272 --> 01:08:07.277
Help me, help me

01:08:09.233 --> 01:08:10.317
More hoses here

01:08:10.359 --> 01:08:11.903
The area is hot there

01:08:12.112 --> 01:08:13.237
I understood

01:08:14.238 --> 01:08:15.990
You have to stay away, people

01:08:34.176 --> 01:08:36.087
Jesus Christ

01:08:41.725 --> 01:08:44.118
Welcome, Mr. You're not okay

01:08:50.484 --> 01:08:51.611
Stop

01:08:51.819 --> 01:08:53.071
its enough

01:08:59.953 --> 01:09:02.413
I am the investigator (Mortis), the homicide department

01:09:02.622 --> 01:09:05.000
You are a cop

01:09:05.023 --> 01:09:06.162
!Surprise

01:09:08.587 --> 01:09:11.147
I need your weapon, officer

01:09:18.684 --> 01:09:19.975
Thank

01:09:44.919 --> 01:09:46.295
ladies and gentlemen

01:09:46.390 --> 01:09:49.255
Last week we were all shocked and saddened

01:09:49.465 --> 01:09:53.469
With the news of the sudden death of Arthur B. Woodermelck

01:09:53.676 --> 01:09:56.095
I would like to take the opportunity

01:09:56.305 --> 01:09:59.098
To review his many achievements

01:10:00.058 --> 01:10:04.480
But hey, why do not we let Arthur () tell you himself?)

01:10:04.688 --> 01:10:07.942
Ladies and gentlemen, I present to you (Arthur B. Ludermelk)

01:10:13.574 --> 01:10:15.493
Dear friends and colleagues

01:10:15.700 --> 01:10:17.953
I am pleased to see you again

01:10:18.162 --> 01:10:19.747
(I saw you buried, O Arthur

01:10:19.955 --> 01:10:21.415
Damn I saw you buried

01:10:21.623 --> 01:10:24.417
(Unfortunately, you were fooled (Walter

01:10:24.627 --> 01:10:27.337
The person who occupies my grave, is

01:10:27.547 --> 01:10:31.905
Volunteer personally selected (by Dr. McNab)

01:10:33.095 --> 01:10:34.805
As you will see, ladies and gentlemen

01:10:35.013 --> 01:10:41.121
The presentation that you are going to see makes the funeral unnecessary

01:10:55.577 --> 01:10:58.538
Have you built an aviation empire?

01:10:58.746 --> 01:11:01.165
Only to divide your wealth among a group of wolves

01:11:01.374 --> 01:11:04.919
Who are the trolling relatives?

01:11:05.128 --> 01:11:11.802
Gertrude Bellman), would it be satisfactory) to see your name on a memorial plaque in the library?

01:11:12.010 --> 01:11:14.012
(We shall all die, O Arthur

01:11:14.220 --> 01:11:18.685
We have every means to avoid this (O) Gertrude

01:11:18.892 --> 01:11:23.063
How many do you think we have of the rich there tonight?

01:11:23.273 --> 01:11:25.900
Is not it frustrating that all that money

01:11:26.109 --> 01:11:29.903
And all that innate power in your grip

01:11:30.113 --> 01:11:31.864
Then disappear, suddenly

01:11:32.073 --> 01:11:34.701
Suddenly, your case ends up 6 feet below the ground

01:11:34.909 --> 01:11:42.000
While a handful of petty greed will devour everything you care about, and rodents devour a piece of cheese

01:11:42.208 --> 01:11:43.502
Is not this sad?

01:11:43.711 --> 01:11:45.879
Everyone is dying, rich and poor

01:11:46.088 --> 01:11:48.465
Death does not exclude anyone

01:11:48.674 --> 01:11:49.841
At least not yet

01:11:50.050 --> 01:11:51.426
This is ridiculous

01:11:51.636 --> 01:11:53.345
Well, let's face it

01:11:54.472 --> 01:11:56.307
The poor are supposed to die

01:11:56.516 --> 01:11:58.727
But the same rule does not apply to us

01:11:58.934 --> 01:12:00.062
We are rich

01:12:00.270 --> 01:12:04.023
Mr. wants us to live forever and if he does not want to

01:12:04.232 --> 01:12:07.069
We can always bribe him

01:12:07.277 --> 01:12:10.030
It will cost you half of your wealth

01:12:10.238 --> 01:12:12.818
But you will have eternity to restore it

01:12:44.732 --> 01:12:46.610
(Think of what I'm offering, Seth

01:12:46.819 --> 01:12:47.945
Life without end

01:12:48.153 --> 01:12:53.535
The profits of your own investments will increase for millions of years

01:12:53.744 --> 01:12:55.912
What is your trick, Arthur?

01:12:56.018 --> 01:12:58.123
It is not gimmick but eternal life

01:12:58.332 --> 01:12:59.457
Bullshit

01:12:59.667 --> 01:13:01.293
I know this sounds silly

01:13:01.502 --> 01:13:05.172
It seems impossible but I am a living guide

01:13:05.381 --> 01:13:09.385
I have prepared a small graphic for you

01:13:09.592 --> 01:13:13.076
This man died of several hours

01:13:13.597 --> 01:13:16.349
Come on, examine it yourself

01:13:23.066 --> 01:13:24.233
Sit

01:13:24.442 --> 01:13:28.738
As you have all seen, this man is dead

01:13:28.947 --> 01:13:33.744
I will give you a small presentation of the product

01:13:33.951 --> 01:13:36.413
Dr. McNab, if you would? - Of course -

01:13:36.620 --> 01:13:39.832
This model is our latest model

01:13:40.040 --> 01:13:44.714
Which grants eternal life without any restrictions

01:14:54.914 --> 01:14:57.332
All right, do not rise

01:14:59.835 --> 01:15:01.795
kill him

01:15:12.682 --> 01:15:14.016
I asked that no one rise

01:15:55.352 --> 01:15:56.769
what do you want?

01:15:56.979 --> 01:15:58.730
You are not an old man

01:15:58.939 --> 01:16:00.064
I want it

01:16:00.095 --> 01:16:01.525
(You are in the dead, O McNab

01:16:01.733 --> 01:16:03.359
You are dead more than I am

01:16:03.569 --> 01:16:05.362
I do not think so

01:16:06.448 --> 01:16:10.619
(Dogg)

01:16:12.745 --> 01:16:14.496
Dogg), you are alive)

01:16:14.705 --> 01:16:16.707
(He can not understand what you're saying, Roger

01:16:16.917 --> 01:16:18.752
His brain had been dead for a long time

01:16:18.959 --> 01:16:22.881
Which means that he is mindless and very obedient

01:16:23.090 --> 01:16:25.091
Will you kill this man?

01:16:25.301 --> 01:16:26.843
Will you kill this man?

01:16:27.052 --> 01:16:28.470
Dogg), stopped)

01:16:28.530 --> 01:16:29.996
(This is me, O (Doug (Roger)

01:16:30.329 --> 01:16:31.850
Will you kill this man?

01:16:31.877 --> 01:16:32.917
Dogg), do not do)

01:16:33.017 --> 01:16:36.146
Will you kill this man? - (Dog) -

01:16:39.066 --> 01:16:40.107
(Listen, O (Doug

01:16:40.317 --> 01:16:42.693
Do you realize that we will die on the same day?

01:16:42.903 --> 01:16:45.197
Doug), do you know what we can do?) We can have a party for our day of death

01:16:45.404 --> 01:16:46.697
We can invite all our friends

01:16:46.906 --> 01:16:48.574
And we sink in

01:16:48.784 --> 01:16:50.035
!do something

01:16:50.242 --> 01:16:53.455
Kill him, come on, you dead brain dead

01:16:53.623 --> 01:16:54.874
! (Dogg)

01:16:55.082 --> 01:16:56.416
Do you remember lipstick?

01:16:56.626 --> 01:16:58.085
Purple wine?

01:16:58.293 --> 01:17:00.065
Highlights the color of my eyes?

01:17:01.214 --> 01:17:02.507
Roger (?)

01:17:04.216 --> 01:17:05.677
! (Roger)

01:17:08.096 --> 01:17:09.555
(Hello, Doug

01:17:09.763 --> 01:17:13.811
Welcome to the zombie homeland

01:17:14.894 --> 01:17:16.229
(Roger)

01:17:16.438 --> 01:17:18.696
... ordered me to

01:17:19.109 --> 01:17:21.001
He ordered me to hurt you

01:17:22.904 --> 01:17:25.151
But I will hurt him

01:17:26.740 --> 01:17:29.034
Will you kill this man?

01:17:29.243 --> 01:17:31.161
Hey, Willie, no

01:17:38.253 --> 01:17:39.254
!Kill him

01:17:39.462 --> 01:17:41.424
Why do not you kill him?

01:17:41.631 --> 01:17:43.276
"Shut up, you stinking old man!"

01:17:52.350 --> 01:17:55.445
No, you will not kill me, you bastards

01:17:57.815 --> 01:17:59.108
you tricked me

01:18:01.234 --> 01:18:04.721
(Damn you, O McNab! You fooled me

01:18:05.532 --> 01:18:08.662
(It's over, Roger. Forget it, man

01:18:11.538 --> 01:18:13.581
Not yet

01:18:40.068 --> 01:18:41.779
Hello, Doctor

01:18:41.987 --> 01:18:45.282
Do you want to see what happens when someone revives for two?

01:18:45.490 --> 01:18:46.743
not really

01:18:51.497 --> 01:18:54.793
Woe, no, no, no

01:19:00.299 --> 01:19:01.592
Hey!

01:19:01.800 --> 01:19:03.135
Save the machine

01:19:03.343 --> 01:19:04.385
It is exposed to an electric palace

01:19:04.594 --> 01:19:05.637
We can fix it

01:19:05.846 --> 01:19:07.514
I can make you natural again

01:19:07.723 --> 01:19:08.779
They are immortal

01:19:09.599 --> 01:19:11.018
I will give you what you desire

01:19:11.226 --> 01:19:13.646
Money, power, eternal life

01:19:13.766 --> 01:19:16.565
Wealth beyond your most beautiful dreams

01:19:16.773 --> 01:19:19.038
But save the machine

01:19:31.164 --> 01:19:32.950
No, no, stop

01:19:33.051 --> 01:19:34.290
Stop!

01:19:35.960 --> 01:19:37.211
Wait!

01:19:37.420 --> 01:19:39.088
Wait, you do not understand

01:19:39.297 --> 01:19:40.798
You will live forever

01:19:41.007 --> 01:19:42.450
!forever

01:19:46.097 --> 01:19:48.182
Oh hell, you're in a pitiful state (oh Roger

01:19:48.391 --> 01:19:50.393
I saw a loaf of meat looks better than you

01:19:50.600 --> 01:19:54.356
You are not in good shape

01:19:54.565 --> 01:19:57.400
We kicked his ass, did not we? We spent them

01:19:57.609 --> 01:20:00.445
(Their asses, O (Roger

01:20:00.653 --> 01:20:02.530
Roger), do you think we'll get hurt again?)

01:20:02.739 --> 01:20:03.632
In what?

01:20:03.740 --> 01:20:06.286
I do not know, maybe you can choose to be the person you want to be

01:20:06.493 --> 01:20:07.828
You mean, as a politician, or a president?

01:20:08.037 --> 01:20:09.664
Or an award-winning novelist?

01:20:09.873 --> 01:20:12.876
Personally I like the Incarnation as a seat for a girl bike

01:20:13.083 --> 01:20:14.752
This is really inspiring

01:20:14.960 --> 01:20:16.129
Thank

01:20:16.336 --> 01:20:18.172
Do you know, Doug? - What? -

01:20:18.381 --> 01:20:20.478
Perhaps this is the end of a beautiful friendship

01:20:20.634 --> 01:20:27.587
