00:20.760 --> 00:21.715
Hit it!

00:23.520 --> 00:24.771
Come on, yeah, dance

00:35.240 --> 00:37.185
Cute and cuddly, boys.

01:17.760 --> 01:20.115
Gentlemen, we are a go-ho-ho.

01:22.120 --> 01:24.475
I can't believe it's here!
I'm so excited!

01:26.320 --> 01:27.799
All right, people.

01:28.000 --> 01:30.514
Time to jangle the jingles
and Kriss the Kringles.

01:30.720 --> 01:34.440
We are t-minus 14 hours to Kidsmas.

01:36.680 --> 01:40.229
Mr. Skipper penguin,
is the Kidsmas really here?

01:40.440 --> 01:43.455
- You bet your downy derrière.
- But not till morning.

01:43.640 --> 01:46.495
So, skedaddle those eager
britches on home now.

01:47.480 --> 01:49.334
No peeking.

01:49.520 --> 01:52.409
Excuse me? Hi. So Kidsmas.

01:52.600 --> 01:55.683
I'm confused.
This relates to Christmas how exactly?

01:55.880 --> 01:57.996
Kowalski, get the reptile up to speed.

01:59.080 --> 02:01.162
Well, Roger,
every year the Central Park Zoo

02:01.360 --> 02:04.215
closes from Christmas Eve
to the morning of December 26th.

02:04.400 --> 02:05.947
Also known as Boxing Day!

02:06.160 --> 02:08.583
We're not interested in
your made-up holidays, Private.

02:09.840 --> 02:12.126
We take advantage
of this human-free environment

02:12.320 --> 02:16.438
to throw a mondo Christmas fiesta
for the animal families of Central Park.

02:16.640 --> 02:18.289
An event we like to call...

02:19.200 --> 02:20.679
Kidsmas!

02:21.880 --> 02:24.826
Tomorrow morning!

02:27.360 --> 02:31.114
You know the drill, people.
So open those assignment cards.

02:33.520 --> 02:36.569
And let's go make this
the best Kidsmas ever!

02:36.760 --> 02:39.308
- Hey, watch out...
- Excuse us! Royalty coming through.

02:39.520 --> 02:42.774
Hello? Who do I give a
talking at if my job is stupid?

02:42.960 --> 02:44.643
- And lame?
- Lame?

02:44.840 --> 02:46.455
Children love the gingerbread house.

02:46.640 --> 02:50.827
Yes, and they also love finding
crusty things in their own noses!

02:51.960 --> 02:53.973
Mine had a kazoo!

02:56.520 --> 02:57.475
I am a king.

02:57.680 --> 03:01.867
I demand the most important
of all the Kidsmas tasks!

03:02.080 --> 03:06.403
Demand denied. Kidsmas is a well-oiled
machine with years of tradition.

03:06.600 --> 03:08.852
Mason always dresses up as Zoo Santa.

03:11.880 --> 03:13.802
Burt makes his famous peanutnog.

03:14.000 --> 03:16.651
The secret ingredient is peanuts.

03:16.840 --> 03:17.920
And so on.

03:18.120 --> 03:20.577
We're not swapping assignments
the night before the big event.

03:20.760 --> 03:22.375
- End of story.
- Oh, really?

03:22.560 --> 03:24.608
What happened
to the freedom of changing?

03:24.800 --> 03:27.985
What happened to the rights
of the peoples?

03:28.200 --> 03:29.952
- I thought this was France!
- America.

03:30.160 --> 03:32.344
No, really.
I seriously thought this was France.

03:32.560 --> 03:35.484
I've been looking for some decent
crepes for, like, three months.

03:35.680 --> 03:38.228
Yo, hey. The little guy's got a point.

03:38.440 --> 03:41.796
Yeah, I'm sick of doing
the same job every year.

03:42.000 --> 03:44.651
Yes, the pressure of
the lead role is rather brutal.

03:44.840 --> 03:46.455
Yeah, different!

03:47.400 --> 03:50.881
We're on an overnight deadline, people!
There's no time to...

03:51.080 --> 03:54.095
Yes! Let's mixy-mix the Kidsmas!

03:54.280 --> 03:55.668
Hey!

03:59.760 --> 04:03.082
Hey, music! That's perfect for me.

04:03.960 --> 04:06.713
All right! I'm on decorations!

04:11.160 --> 04:12.912
Best committee ever.

04:14.920 --> 04:17.172
Smashing! I'm on decorations.

04:17.360 --> 04:19.680
No way. Me, too. Look!

04:19.880 --> 04:21.928
Best committee ever!

04:22.120 --> 04:25.305
No. Lame. Blah. Double blah.

04:25.520 --> 04:27.203
Yes! Yes!

04:27.400 --> 04:30.119
I will find the Christmas-y tree!

04:30.320 --> 04:33.107
Truly there's no job
more important than...

04:33.320 --> 04:35.606
- Santa!
- What? Who's playing Santa?

04:35.800 --> 04:38.348
You are, Skipper.
It's the last one left.

04:38.560 --> 04:40.846
You didn't even pick and you got
the most important job of all.

04:41.040 --> 04:42.155
How lucky is that?

04:42.360 --> 04:44.248
Most...

04:44.440 --> 04:45.793
...important?

04:47.440 --> 04:49.590
Me? Play the Big Red himself?

04:49.800 --> 04:51.552
And I'm your jolly little elf!

04:51.760 --> 04:53.773
I'm little figgy pudding
I'm...

04:54.000 --> 04:56.924
Negative! This is holiday anarchy!

04:57.120 --> 04:59.873
We go down this road,
there won't even be a Kidsmas.

05:00.080 --> 05:02.366
No Kidsmas?

05:02.560 --> 05:05.017
Hey! You weren't supposed to hear that.

05:05.200 --> 05:06.155
I'm just...

05:08.120 --> 05:10.270
You know what anarchy is,
don't you kids?

05:12.400 --> 05:13.913
We've only got one night, and...

05:17.440 --> 05:19.726
Chins up, soldiers.
I've got it covered.

05:21.000 --> 05:22.854
- Hey, all right!
- Can you tell I'm excited?

05:23.040 --> 05:25.122
Yeah, we should go
total rock 'n roll this year.

05:25.320 --> 05:27.641
Like sled jumps and flashpots.

05:27.840 --> 05:30.525
And ski punk snowmen
who are like, "What's up?"

05:31.760 --> 05:33.808
We should go completely
Charles Dickens this year.

05:34.000 --> 05:36.855
Top hats, monocles,
unimpeachable etiquette.

05:37.840 --> 05:39.853
Kids love etiquette!

05:40.520 --> 05:42.704
See? Nothing to worry about.

05:42.920 --> 05:47.209
It's Kidsmas! Santa magic
will take care of everything.

05:48.040 --> 05:49.758
Santa magic?

05:52.520 --> 05:55.068
It is a thrill to be on the
music committee with you guys,

05:55.280 --> 05:57.134
so let's warm up a little bit, shall we?

06:06.320 --> 06:09.175
Private, 86 that caterwaul!

06:09.840 --> 06:11.091
Curse you, Internet!

06:11.280 --> 06:15.000
Twenty-eight thousand cat videos,
zero useful information!

06:18.000 --> 06:20.116
"We Wish You A Meowy Christmas".

06:21.960 --> 06:24.076
I'm sorry, Skipper,
but it's just one party.

06:24.280 --> 06:25.736
Do you need the real Santa magic?

06:25.920 --> 06:30.380
If Mr. Tub of Jolly has
some sparkly, mystic secret,

06:30.560 --> 06:31.743
I need to find it, ASAP!

06:31.960 --> 06:34.281
Then we should ask Santa! He'd know!

06:35.400 --> 06:36.879
Don't get up. I'll do it for you.

06:37.080 --> 06:39.628
Good thinking, young Private.
Let's slide.

06:44.440 --> 06:46.920
So I'm thinking the Eastern White Pine.

06:47.120 --> 06:51.068
Or maybe you're more of
a Douglas-fir guy. That's cool.

06:51.760 --> 06:53.079
Norway Spruce?

06:53.280 --> 06:56.431
Must I... even louder for you, Maurice?

06:56.640 --> 06:59.393
It is not the flavour of the tree
that is the problem.

06:59.600 --> 07:01.522
It is the not-importance of it!

07:01.720 --> 07:04.905
I thought tree-choosing
was the most important-est job.

07:05.120 --> 07:06.371
Yeah, it was.

07:06.560 --> 07:09.506
Until the frowny flat-head penguin
got a better one.

07:09.720 --> 07:14.441
Now we must find the amazing-est tree
in the history of Kidsmas!

07:14.640 --> 07:16.528
You really think we
can find a tree like that?

07:16.720 --> 07:20.474
Hey, this is New York City, baby!
The capital of France!

07:20.680 --> 07:23.626
If you can't find it here,
you cannot be finding it anywhere!

07:23.840 --> 07:26.491
I will find the amazing tree,
King Julien!

07:28.440 --> 07:30.123
Is this one amazing?

07:30.320 --> 07:32.800
Jolly old Saint Nick in sight.

07:33.000 --> 07:35.252
Now show me your secrets, magic man.

07:35.440 --> 07:36.828
I don't understand, Skipper.

07:37.040 --> 07:39.725
Yes. Why the bell ringing,
and a tip jar?

07:39.920 --> 07:41.638
That just seems crass.

07:41.840 --> 07:44.354
No. I mean I don't understand
why there are two of them.

07:44.560 --> 07:46.881
What? Sweet Secret Service!

07:47.080 --> 07:48.160
He's got a body double!

07:48.360 --> 07:51.045
That must be some
primo magic he's protecting.

07:51.240 --> 07:52.719
Look, they're leaving!

07:53.600 --> 07:55.648
Blast! No time to ID
which one is the phoney.

07:55.840 --> 07:57.785
Private, pin a tail on the Santa Bravo.

07:58.000 --> 07:59.388
I'm on the Alpha Claus.

08:22.720 --> 08:25.905
Look, sweetie, it's Santa!

08:32.679 --> 08:33.999
Nevermind, Mort.

08:34.200 --> 08:37.124
Your face tried,
but the glass just wanted it more.

08:37.320 --> 08:39.072
I'm tapped out, Your Majesty.

08:39.280 --> 08:41.328
We've seen real trees, fake trees...

08:41.520 --> 08:42.452
Toiletries!

08:42.640 --> 08:44.528
...and you keep turning up your nose
at all of them.

08:44.720 --> 08:48.042
Because none is amazing enough
to beat the Santa penguin!

08:48.240 --> 08:51.789
I need a tree that sits up,
smacks you upon the face

08:52.000 --> 08:53.319
and says "Christmas!"

08:53.520 --> 08:55.875
This one says it in 17 languages.

08:56.080 --> 08:57.798
Merry Christmas!

09:04.880 --> 09:06.563
I found it!

09:06.760 --> 09:09.376
The amazing tree!

09:09.560 --> 09:11.881
I know it is small and ugly.

09:12.080 --> 09:15.095
But if somebody was
nice to it and loved it,

09:15.280 --> 09:18.636
it could grow up to be a beautiful swan.

09:18.840 --> 09:22.128
And that is the true meaning
of Chinese New Year!

09:22.320 --> 09:24.072
- Christmas.
- What's a "Christmas"?

09:24.280 --> 09:26.430
That tree is perfect.

09:26.640 --> 09:29.757
Now move the puny "ug" tree
so I can get a good look at it.

09:32.240 --> 09:34.094
Choppity-chop with the chopping!

09:51.280 --> 09:52.463
Minty.

09:58.080 --> 10:00.731
Private! I thought I put you
on Santa surveillance duty.

10:00.920 --> 10:03.639
I was, Skipper. He went in there.

10:03.840 --> 10:06.126
Impossible! My Santa went in there.

10:06.320 --> 10:09.403
Why even have a body double if you're
just gonna hang out in the same room?

10:09.600 --> 10:11.215
About that... Isn't it a bit fishy

10:11.400 --> 10:14.517
that Santa's just
strolling about on Christmas Eve?

10:14.720 --> 10:19.714
With no reindeer? Or sleigh?
And he's using an elevator?

10:20.480 --> 10:21.526
Both fakes?

10:21.720 --> 10:25.611
How are those two phoney Papa Noels
tied into this mysterious disappearance?

10:25.800 --> 10:27.518
Wait! Santa disappeared?

10:27.720 --> 10:29.233
You haven't seen him, have you?

10:29.440 --> 10:30.953
Well, no, but...

10:31.160 --> 10:35.017
- You don't think...
- No. I act. With maximum force.

10:36.560 --> 10:39.176
Initiate takedown protocol
Foxtrot, Private.

10:39.360 --> 10:41.146
You get the first one. I'll handle...

10:45.840 --> 10:47.489
Oh, sugar plums.

10:51.080 --> 10:53.537
- Skipper?
- Windup Monkey Misdirect. Execute!

11:01.320 --> 11:04.107
Cute toys. You know where
I can pick up a couple for my kid?

11:04.320 --> 11:07.505
OK, I'll take the lead voice,
you'll take the ostinato.

11:09.960 --> 11:11.040
The ding dongs.

11:11.240 --> 11:14.824
Ding dong
Ding dong

11:15.040 --> 11:16.826
Here come the bells
I hear the bells

11:17.040 --> 11:18.086
That's not the bells

11:18.280 --> 11:19.827
What is going on here?

11:21.240 --> 11:24.664
Excuse me, fellas? We're on kind of
a tight schedule here and I don't...

11:24.840 --> 11:29.129
So shut it, already. We're trying to
write a Kidsmas tune here, you mind?

11:29.720 --> 11:32.837
Hey, yo, Bing.
You got a rhyme for "yellow snow"?

11:33.040 --> 11:34.985
OK, how about... What?

11:35.360 --> 11:36.440
Backing off.

11:40.040 --> 11:41.086
Rock 'n roll, Rico!

11:41.280 --> 11:44.738
Just a few hours till daylight and
the zoo's only halfway decorated! I...

11:50.680 --> 11:52.159
Guys? What are you doing?

11:52.360 --> 11:54.248
Our jobs. Obviously.

11:54.440 --> 11:57.625
Decorating in 19th century
Dickensian regalia.

11:58.880 --> 12:01.826
OK, first,
we're the decorations committee.

12:02.040 --> 12:04.088
Second... Dickens?

12:04.280 --> 12:08.000
Yeah, did you get a visit from the ghost
of Christmas "been there, done that"?

12:08.200 --> 12:10.953
No, no, no.
We are the decorations committee.

12:11.160 --> 12:15.483
And at least our ideas didn't come from
the pages of Winter Hooligan Monthly.

12:18.920 --> 12:21.104
I guess we were all
supposed to work together, huh?

12:21.320 --> 12:23.777
No problem.
We can clear your junk out in no time.

12:26.880 --> 12:28.734
I say humbug to you, sir!

12:28.920 --> 12:31.844
- Humbug, humbug, humbug!
- Guys, guys!

12:32.040 --> 12:35.157
Obviously, there's a difference
in styles here, but come on!

12:35.360 --> 12:36.816
It's Christmas.

12:37.000 --> 12:40.891
There's nothing we can't fix with
a little peace, love and togetherness.

12:45.880 --> 12:48.531
Tot, tot, old bean, think nothing of it.

12:49.680 --> 12:51.796
OK, great. So how do we solve this?

12:53.000 --> 12:56.788
Let's say... elephant rules.

12:57.000 --> 12:59.150
OK. What are elephant rules?

12:59.520 --> 13:02.307
Smashin'stuff with Burt's big heinie

13:02.520 --> 13:04.772
Squash a squash a squash
squash squash

13:05.800 --> 13:07.188
Cheerio!

13:07.400 --> 13:11.257
Rico, my man? This otter's
about to join the naughty list.

13:14.600 --> 13:16.283
Not the sleigh! Wait!

13:17.440 --> 13:20.364
Hey, not a bad charity haul this year.
Merry Christmas, guys.

13:20.560 --> 13:21.606
Merry Christmas!

13:29.920 --> 13:31.239
Wha... What?

13:33.480 --> 13:36.096
What is this? Some kind of joke?
Esposito, is that you?

13:36.280 --> 13:38.328
Do we really have time
for conspiracies, Skipper?

13:38.520 --> 13:40.636
You promised the children
the zoo would be ready for Kidsmas.

13:40.840 --> 13:42.091
Santa magic, Private.

13:42.280 --> 13:45.431
We get that and we're
walking in a winter wonderland.

13:45.640 --> 13:49.758
Where are you anti-Yule radicals
holding Santa and his magic?

13:49.960 --> 13:51.507
Hey, seriously, where am I?

13:51.720 --> 13:55.269
You are on the bus to Pain-sylvania.

14:03.680 --> 14:05.568
I'm a lumberjack!

14:06.520 --> 14:07.703
Matey!

14:09.360 --> 14:11.681
Hey, somebody's stealing the big tree!

14:11.880 --> 14:13.359
Not in my city, pal!

14:15.680 --> 14:18.433
Yes! Look at their faces! Punch it.

14:21.560 --> 14:25.644
This is Chuck Charles
and my van has just been stolen,

14:25.840 --> 14:28.297
along with the city's Christmas tree.

14:29.120 --> 14:31.668
Chuck? Without the van,
we're not really broadcasting anything.

14:31.880 --> 14:35.429
I know, but I am no longer
able to speak in a normal voice.

14:43.080 --> 14:44.468
The real Santa must have escaped!

14:44.680 --> 14:46.568
And the imposters are
trying to haul him back in.

14:46.760 --> 14:50.241
- Execute Mobile Rescue Op!
- But Skipper, the zoo! Kidsmas!

14:50.440 --> 14:53.694
Follow the magic, Private.
Remember the Winter Wonderland plan.

15:06.680 --> 15:08.932
Oh, a plan. Good. What did he say?

15:22.160 --> 15:24.310
We're losing more
plywood men by the second!

15:24.560 --> 15:25.743
Hold your ground!

15:25.960 --> 15:28.383
We all knew there would be casualties!

15:31.320 --> 15:33.504
They got... Tiny Tim.

15:33.720 --> 15:35.665
You may strike our decorations,

15:35.880 --> 15:39.532
but you shall never conquer
the spirit of Charles Dickens.

15:39.720 --> 15:41.972
And his razor-brimmed top hat!

15:45.080 --> 15:48.163
Actually, I don't believe
Dickens had a razor-brimmed hat.

15:48.360 --> 15:50.146
Learn your history, chimp.

15:52.520 --> 15:54.203
Dashing through the street

15:54.400 --> 15:56.482
I think it's pretty neat

15:56.680 --> 15:58.602
That we scored the best Christmas tree

15:58.800 --> 16:00.984
Hey penguins, you can eat it

16:01.200 --> 16:02.849
Julien
Julien

16:03.040 --> 16:04.928
You really are too much

16:05.120 --> 16:06.803
It's time the feet let off the gas

16:07.000 --> 16:08.683
And stepped on me, the clutch

16:10.600 --> 16:11.988
We're being high-speed chas-ed!

16:12.200 --> 16:13.986
Quick, more clutch!

16:43.320 --> 16:44.969
Lmposters dispatched.

16:45.160 --> 16:48.812
Now let's go rescue the genuine,
one and only Santa.

16:49.000 --> 16:50.683
- Santa?
- Ringtail?

16:50.880 --> 16:51.995
Santa!

16:53.640 --> 16:55.323
- Tree!
- Animals!

16:55.520 --> 16:57.033
- Confused!
- Potato!

16:57.240 --> 16:59.788
Abandon van.
We must save the tree!

17:02.040 --> 17:04.497
What in the name of
Good King Wenceslas are you...

17:13.440 --> 17:15.157
Are you sure we're not too early?

17:19.240 --> 17:22.561
Welcome to our
Kidsmas Winter Funderland!

17:23.280 --> 17:26.965
A sooth, the lass, doth mean
our Dickensian celebration of...

17:28.680 --> 17:32.002
You know what? Maybe we'll just
come back on a different holiday.

17:32.400 --> 17:35.016
No, no, no. It's OK.
Really, really, we got big fun ahead.

17:35.200 --> 17:37.282
We got music...

17:37.480 --> 17:41.200
Ding dong
Ding dong

17:42.360 --> 17:43.748
And games! We've got games!

17:43.960 --> 17:46.713
Who wants first go at the Santa piñata?

17:49.320 --> 17:51.368
- What are you doing?!
- You call this a children's party?

17:51.560 --> 17:52.458
- We're leaving!
- Wait!

17:52.640 --> 17:55.256
We haven't even decorated
the Christmas tree yet!

17:58.720 --> 18:00.802
I'd like to go home now.

18:03.240 --> 18:04.286
What?

18:06.360 --> 18:10.217
Somebody wanna tell me what in
the Jack Frost is going on here?

18:10.400 --> 18:12.516
Well, Skipper, it seems some people

18:12.720 --> 18:14.802
don't appreciate
the finer decorating arts.

18:15.000 --> 18:18.151
And some people are suffering
from chronic boring disorder.

18:19.520 --> 18:23.172
And some people wrecked my
completely awesome Christmas-y tree.

18:23.360 --> 18:25.840
- You were one of those people.
- I was deliberately being vague.

18:27.080 --> 18:28.433
I had a vision!

18:33.000 --> 18:34.251
Didn't I warn you people?

18:34.440 --> 18:36.795
I can't leave you alone
for one night without...

18:37.560 --> 18:41.041
You said this would
be the best Kidsmas.

18:41.240 --> 18:43.959
You... promised.

18:46.720 --> 18:49.871
We... We ruined Kidsmas.

18:50.080 --> 18:53.800
No, I'm the Santa here.
This was on my watch.

18:54.000 --> 18:55.922
What have I done?

19:11.240 --> 19:15.188
Well, for starters, you roughed up
a dozen of my deputies

19:15.400 --> 19:18.551
and helped wreck the world's
most famous Christmas tree.

19:18.760 --> 19:21.274
And I thought I had a busy night.

19:21.480 --> 19:23.266
Hey... Julien.

19:23.480 --> 19:24.663
'Sup, baby?

19:24.880 --> 19:25.995
We go way back.

19:26.200 --> 19:27.883
Santa... Real Santa?

19:28.080 --> 19:30.867
Those dime store phoney Clauses
work for you?

19:31.080 --> 19:33.935
They do the charity work.
I deliver the toys.

19:34.120 --> 19:35.508
Works out great when they're not

19:35.720 --> 19:38.871
being karate chopped off
a speeding Christmas tree.

19:39.080 --> 19:39.978
We're sorry, Santa.

19:40.160 --> 19:42.310
We didn't mean to make
such a mess of things.

19:42.520 --> 19:46.536
All I wanted was a tiny taste
of that real Santa magic.

19:46.720 --> 19:51.669
Santa magic? But Skipper,
you had that from the beginning.

19:51.880 --> 19:53.199
Really? Well then, how do I use?

19:53.400 --> 19:55.686
What am I, your guidance counsellor?

19:55.880 --> 19:58.599
I gotta haul toys
to seven more time zones.

19:58.800 --> 20:00.848
Trust me. You'll figure it out.

20:04.520 --> 20:06.704
What do you suppose he meant:
"You had it from the beginning"?

20:06.920 --> 20:09.707
The beginning. I don't... Of course!

20:09.920 --> 20:11.376
- Skipper?
- Santa magic...

20:11.560 --> 20:15.212
...coursing through veins...
feels... gingerbread-y.

20:16.040 --> 20:19.055
Follow my lead, people!
And can I get some holiday music here?

20:19.240 --> 20:21.891
That would be perfect except that
we haven't practised as much as we...

20:22.080 --> 20:23.559
Yo, absolutely.

20:26.000 --> 20:28.321
Santa magic says try it in "G."

20:30.600 --> 20:33.455
It's Christmas day
but you're feeling low

20:33.640 --> 20:37.758
With the cold grey skies
and the yellow snow

20:37.960 --> 20:39.973
Something something something

20:41.480 --> 20:42.731
But I'll tell you pal

20:42.920 --> 20:46.708
One thing you gotta know

20:48.000 --> 20:50.889
It ain't perfect
but it's Christmas

20:51.080 --> 20:54.095
So what if you didn't get
all your Christmas wishes

20:54.280 --> 20:55.531
There ain't another day

20:55.720 --> 20:57.267
That's a better one
than this is

20:57.480 --> 21:00.938
'Cause it ain't perfect, yo,
but it's still Christmas

21:01.120 --> 21:03.839
So Santa skipped the best things
that were on your list

21:04.040 --> 21:07.362
But soldier tell that frown
to cease and desist

21:07.560 --> 21:12.645
If you know where to look
you'll find Christmas bliss

21:12.840 --> 21:13.886
Oh, that's pretty!

21:14.080 --> 21:15.399
We'll sing it one more time

21:15.600 --> 21:17.921
Maybe you will catch the gist

21:21.800 --> 21:25.156
It ain't perfect
but it's Christmas

21:25.360 --> 21:26.509
Yes.

21:26.720 --> 21:28.870
So what if the day's

21:29.080 --> 21:31.969
Had a few minor glitches

21:32.160 --> 21:33.548
Just clean up the mess

21:33.760 --> 21:38.481
And help your mom with the dishes

21:38.680 --> 21:39.692
'Cause kids...

21:39.880 --> 21:44.806
It ain't perfect, no
but it's still Christmas

21:45.000 --> 21:48.117
Christmas
Christmas

21:48.320 --> 21:49.833
Christmas

21:52.480 --> 21:54.129
Christmas!

21:54.920 --> 21:57.206
You really did it!
You found the Santa magic!

21:57.400 --> 21:58.332
What was the secret?

21:58.520 --> 22:01.068
No secret, Private.
Big Red was right.

22:01.280 --> 22:03.134
We had to get back
to where this all started.

22:03.320 --> 22:06.039
Trying to make some
kids happy for Christmas.

22:06.240 --> 22:08.663
That's it? Santa magic's
just making people happy?

22:08.840 --> 22:10.728
Yeah. Seems to work for that guy.

22:24.200 --> 22:27.488
Merry Christmas, Mr. Skipper penguin.

22:27.680 --> 22:29.363
And to all, a good night.

22:29.560 --> 22:31.107
Potato!
