00:01.039 --> 00:02.372
Monsters!

00:06.835 --> 00:09.364
Those guys
hunt monsters.

00:09.365 --> 00:11.232
That is so cool.

00:12.444 --> 00:13.219
Come on!

00:13.220 --> 00:14.618
Mom doesn't want
to leave these people,

00:14.620 --> 00:15.853
so let's take them
with us.

00:15.855 --> 00:18.122
I hate this place
right now.

00:18.124 --> 00:20.858
Those Hunters, t-that's on me.
I brought them here.

00:20.860 --> 00:23.027
Everywhere I look,
I see them.

00:23.029 --> 00:24.028
I see Maggie.

00:24.030 --> 00:27.298
Sam!

00:27.300 --> 00:29.967
You know, I think
I just need some time.

00:30.269 --> 00:31.769
And what about that kid
with the dumb

00:31.771 --> 00:33.203
Bambi-look on his face
all the time?

00:33.205 --> 00:34.038
Hello.

00:34.040 --> 00:35.873
I am a Winchester!

00:35.875 --> 00:40.944
You killed Michael.
You consumed his grace.

00:40.946 --> 00:42.313
Do you have
your powers back?

00:42.315 --> 00:44.982
I'm me again.

00:44.984 --> 00:46.750
And your soul?

00:46.752 --> 00:48.786
You want to know how much
of my soul I had to burn off

00:48.788 --> 00:50.087
to kill Michael.

00:50.089 --> 00:51.555
Yes.

00:51.557 --> 00:53.424
I don't know.

00:53.426 --> 00:54.558
So, what's the verdict?

00:54.560 --> 00:55.893
I'd keep an eye on him,

00:55.895 --> 00:58.395
but I think...
if he seems okay,

00:58.397 --> 01:00.464
he probably is.

01:00.466 --> 01:03.067
I feel...
different now.

01:29.128 --> 01:31.795
What was that?

01:31.797 --> 01:35.265
It was nothing.
Just the wind.

01:37.770 --> 01:39.803
Okay, that --
that wasn't the wind.

01:48.681 --> 01:50.981
I'll check it out.

01:50.983 --> 01:53.851
- What are you guys doing?
- Dad?

01:56.489 --> 01:57.788
Barbara.

01:57.790 --> 01:59.123
Hi, Sheriff.

01:59.125 --> 02:01.392
Do your parents know
where you are right now?

02:01.394 --> 02:03.627
Why do <i>you</i> care?

02:03.629 --> 02:04.895
You're supposed
to be studying.

02:04.897 --> 02:06.897
At Mom's.
This is not your weekend.

02:06.899 --> 02:08.399
Besides, she's --

02:08.401 --> 02:11.168
Out of town. With Todd.
I know.

02:11.170 --> 02:12.903
She called you.
You weren't home.

02:12.905 --> 02:14.304
She called me.

02:14.306 --> 02:16.507
She's worried.

02:16.509 --> 02:19.643
Well, you found me.
Good for you.

02:19.645 --> 02:21.445
- Hey. Watch it.
- Or what?

02:22.815 --> 02:25.182
Hey, where you going?

02:25.184 --> 02:27.684
Um...bathroom.

02:27.686 --> 02:29.353
You guys need some space.

02:37.830 --> 02:39.897
Ugh.

02:55.948 --> 02:58.882
Oh, God.

02:58.884 --> 03:01.685
Tom, you shouldn't
be out here.

03:01.687 --> 03:04.521
But I didn't mean
to embarrass you.

03:04.523 --> 03:06.390
Yeah, you never do.

03:54.907 --> 03:57.174
- Barbara?!
- Stay here.

04:05.751 --> 04:08.919
Barbara!

04:10.789 --> 04:13.824
Barbara!

04:13.826 --> 04:16.760
Barbara?

04:22.868 --> 04:25.502
Hey!

04:32.478 --> 04:36.113
Thomas! Thomas!

04:36.115 --> 04:40.117
No! No!

04:42.688 --> 04:44.888
No...

Morning, sunshine.

05:07.246 --> 05:08.312
Hey.

05:08.314 --> 05:09.413
What you looking at?

05:09.415 --> 05:12.149
Porn? Sex tapes?
Nip slips?

05:12.151 --> 05:14.585
The Internet is more
than just naked people.

05:14.587 --> 05:15.819
You do know that, right?

05:15.821 --> 05:17.020
Not <i>my</i> Internet.

05:18.390 --> 05:20.390
All right.
Check this out.

05:20.392 --> 05:22.259
So, this girl --
her body was found

05:22.261 --> 05:25.362
just outside
Big Creek State Park in Iowa.

05:25.364 --> 05:26.830
Uh, covered in bite marks.

05:26.832 --> 05:28.899
The police are saying
it's an animal attack.

05:28.901 --> 05:30.033
But...?

05:30.035 --> 05:31.735
But I did some digging,

05:31.737 --> 05:35.272
and I found that
there weren't a lot of bodies,

05:35.274 --> 05:37.274
but a lot of people
do go missing in that park.

05:37.276 --> 05:39.409
Look at this.
Park ranger back in '06.

05:39.411 --> 05:43.080
A poacher in '98.
And on and on and on.

05:43.082 --> 05:44.848
I mean, I've only
gone back to 1943,

05:44.850 --> 05:46.883
and I've already found
54 missing people.

05:46.885 --> 05:48.285
- Wow.
- Yeah.

05:48.287 --> 05:50.253
Yeah. Sounds like
our kind of thing.

05:50.255 --> 05:51.688
You sure you're up for it?

05:51.690 --> 05:53.857
I mean, I know you wanted
to take some time.

05:53.859 --> 05:55.959
No, I-I'm -- I'm good.

05:55.961 --> 05:57.961
Honestly, I-I'm good.

05:57.963 --> 06:00.097
All right.
Well, let's hit it.

06:00.099 --> 06:01.365
You got it.
I'll grab Cass.

06:01.367 --> 06:03.433
Mm. He actually left.

06:03.435 --> 06:04.635
What?
Early this morning.

06:04.637 --> 06:05.902
Why?
I don't know.

06:05.904 --> 06:07.270
Something about
being cooped up

06:07.272 --> 06:08.805
in the bunker
for a few weeks.

06:08.807 --> 06:10.807
We all need to stretch
our legs. I get it.

06:10.809 --> 06:13.644
All right.
Uh, then, Jack.

06:13.646 --> 06:15.379
Uh...

06:15.381 --> 06:17.247
I don't want Jack on this.

06:17.249 --> 06:19.916
I thought you said Donatello
gave him the all clear?

06:19.918 --> 06:21.918
Yeah, he did.

06:21.920 --> 06:23.387
And I'm --
I'm sure he's good.

06:23.389 --> 06:24.988
But...

06:24.990 --> 06:26.823
Jack's got his mojo back.

06:26.825 --> 06:28.592
His powers have gotten us
in trouble in the past --

06:28.594 --> 06:30.594
the security guard.

06:30.596 --> 06:33.797
So I just want to make sure
that, you know,

06:33.799 --> 06:36.500
he's right before we put him
back out there.

06:38.337 --> 06:40.237
Yeah. Yeah.

06:46.779 --> 06:49.913
- Hey, uh...good reading?
- Yes.

06:49.915 --> 06:52.683
Did you know Article 246
of the Haitian criminal code

06:52.685 --> 06:54.184
officially makes it
against the law

06:54.186 --> 06:56.453
to turn a human
into a zombie?

06:56.455 --> 06:58.355
Good.

06:58.357 --> 07:01.825
Jack, listen. Dean and I are
heading out on a case.

07:01.827 --> 07:05.262
And...you don't
want me to come?

07:05.264 --> 07:06.596
Look, truth is --

07:06.598 --> 07:08.098
We don't want to leave
the bunker empty.

07:08.100 --> 07:10.367
In case, uh, Mom or...

07:10.369 --> 07:14.104
some of the other Hunters call
and need help, so...

07:14.106 --> 07:17.441
And this place is long overdue
for a restock.

07:17.443 --> 07:21.278
So, uh, your mission,
should you choose to accept --

07:21.280 --> 07:23.246
made you a list.

07:27.619 --> 07:29.786
My mission is shopping?

07:32.057 --> 07:34.825
Beer, TP, eggs...

07:34.827 --> 07:35.992
beer again.

07:35.994 --> 07:38.528
- Twice?
- Yeah.

07:42.668 --> 07:43.734
I'll do it.

07:43.736 --> 07:45.235
Great!

07:47.039 --> 07:48.505
We'll be in touch.

07:57.382 --> 07:58.915
I'm sorry.

07:58.917 --> 08:02.152
I just don't really see
how this is an FBI thing.

08:02.154 --> 08:03.820
Wildlife preserve
is government property.

08:03.822 --> 08:05.088
We're the government.

08:05.090 --> 08:07.491
Yeah, well, it is
a large piece of land --

08:07.493 --> 08:09.526
coyotes, rough terrain.

08:09.528 --> 08:11.695
We try to limit hikers
to the trails,

08:11.697 --> 08:13.864
but some of them
don't listen.

08:13.866 --> 08:17.167
Okay, but the girl who died,
she wasn't a hiker.

08:17.169 --> 08:19.102
Do you know what
happened to her?

08:21.874 --> 08:23.807
Like I said, coyotes.

08:26.411 --> 08:28.211
You know, do you mind
if we take a look at the body?

08:28.213 --> 08:29.780
Do I have a choice?

08:29.782 --> 08:31.782
Not really.

08:39.424 --> 08:42.192
Whoa! Mo--

08:42.193 --> 08:44.227
Seriously?

08:44.229 --> 08:45.896
How long you been
doing this?

08:45.898 --> 08:49.366
Well, got catlike reflexes,
okay? What can I say?

08:52.738 --> 08:56.039
Said a coyote did this?

08:56.041 --> 08:57.908
Not even close.
Mnh-mnh.

08:57.910 --> 09:00.877
Look at the skin
around the bite.

09:00.879 --> 09:02.979
It looks...burnt.

09:02.981 --> 09:05.382
So, what the hell
can do that?

09:25.504 --> 09:28.004
♪ <i>We face them all, ghost!</i> ♪

09:28.006 --> 09:29.840
♪ <i>Ghostfacers!</i> ♪

09:29.842 --> 09:32.442
♪ <i>We face the faceless,</i>
<i>we face the dead!</i> ♪

09:32.444 --> 09:34.477
Eliot, stop.

09:34.479 --> 09:36.813
What? The Ghostfacers
are cool.

09:36.815 --> 09:38.648
No.
They're really not.

09:38.650 --> 09:41.852
<i>Pure power at hand...</i>

09:41.854 --> 09:43.320
Uh...

09:43.322 --> 09:45.155
Is that
what's his name?

09:45.157 --> 09:46.523
Bambi?

09:46.525 --> 09:48.425
Hey!

09:51.029 --> 09:53.230
Hello.

09:53.232 --> 09:55.465
Are you lost?

09:55.467 --> 09:57.801
Um...

09:57.803 --> 09:59.536
no.

09:59.538 --> 10:02.372
<i>Shoot that ghost right</i>
<i>in the face! Boo-yah!</i>

10:02.374 --> 10:04.107
<i>Winchesters still</i>
<i>suck ass, though.</i>

10:04.109 --> 10:05.375
<i>Affirmative.</i>

10:05.377 --> 10:07.944
You live with
Sam and Dean, right?

10:07.946 --> 10:11.214
They're not here
right now.

10:11.216 --> 10:12.983
Are they
fighting ghosts?!

10:12.985 --> 10:15.118
What's a ghost?

10:15.120 --> 10:16.353
I should go.

10:16.355 --> 10:18.321
Hey, it's...cool.

10:20.659 --> 10:22.192
We know.

10:22.194 --> 10:24.628
About their whole
Hunter thing.

10:24.630 --> 10:27.530
Oh. Good.

10:27.532 --> 10:29.466
I don't like to lie.

10:29.468 --> 10:31.334
It makes my stomach hurt.

10:31.336 --> 10:35.071
Like when you have to burp,
but you can't burp.

10:37.910 --> 10:39.109
Yeah.

10:41.179 --> 10:42.846
So, you need
something?

10:42.848 --> 10:45.181
I do,
but the store's closed.

10:47.753 --> 10:49.252
Not anymore.

10:55.260 --> 10:58.028
Hey!

10:58.030 --> 10:59.729
Come in.

11:01.366 --> 11:02.866
You okay?

11:06.672 --> 11:07.938
No.

11:11.710 --> 11:13.410
I think I should
talk to them.

11:13.412 --> 11:15.679
Who?

11:15.681 --> 11:18.048
Barbara's parents.

11:21.386 --> 11:23.386
Tom, that's not
a good idea.

11:23.388 --> 11:26.022
I've already spoken to them.
They're grieving.

11:26.024 --> 11:28.391
Dad.

11:28.393 --> 11:29.859
This was my fault.

11:29.861 --> 11:32.028
- That's not true.
- Yes, it is.

11:35.567 --> 11:39.903
Tom, they just need
a little time.

11:39.905 --> 11:42.739
We all do.

11:55.554 --> 11:58.989
I feel...
bad for him.

11:58.991 --> 12:00.957
Same.

12:00.959 --> 12:04.627
I mean, living with
a bunch of dudes.

12:04.629 --> 12:08.565
Their whole place must smell
like beer, Kleenex,

12:08.567 --> 12:12.502
and
Old Spice.

12:14.339 --> 12:17.107
I've been watching these guys
called the Ghostfacers.

12:17.109 --> 12:18.274
You heard of 'em?

12:18.276 --> 12:19.442
No.

12:19.444 --> 12:21.411
They're awesome!

12:21.413 --> 12:25.181
They know all about ghosts,
and I'm reading books.

12:25.183 --> 12:28.151
Oh, I like books, too.
I'm reading about zombies.

12:28.153 --> 12:29.519
Zombies are real?

12:29.521 --> 12:33.089
Well, no.
Not really.

12:33.091 --> 12:34.824
It's kind of
disappointing.

12:34.826 --> 12:37.327
- But there are other monsters.
- Like what?

12:37.329 --> 12:39.929
Oh, vampires, werewolves,
shapeshifters --

12:39.931 --> 12:42.365
I've seen one of those --
djinn, rugaru --

12:42.367 --> 12:45.935
That's a funny name. Yeah.

12:45.937 --> 12:49.639
Wraiths, sirens, demons, ghouls.
All sorts of things.

12:49.641 --> 12:52.542
And you know
about <i>all</i> of them?

12:53.678 --> 12:56.312
Well...yes.

12:56.314 --> 13:00.150
Jack, will you be
my best friend?

13:00.152 --> 13:02.685
Dude, stop stalking him.
Sorry.

13:02.687 --> 13:04.654
Ever since he found out
about this stuff,

13:04.656 --> 13:05.789
he's been obsessed.

13:05.791 --> 13:06.990
It's fine.

13:06.992 --> 13:10.293
Do you ever,
like, hang out?

13:10.295 --> 13:12.662
Well, we have movie nights
on Tuesdays.

13:12.664 --> 13:14.731
Dean usually picks.

13:14.733 --> 13:17.300
I've seen "Lost Boys"
like 36 times.

13:17.302 --> 13:19.536
I mean with kids
your own age.

13:19.538 --> 13:20.870
Well, I'm two.

13:23.675 --> 13:25.341
...enty.

13:25.343 --> 13:27.510
I'm twenty.

13:29.681 --> 13:30.847
Two.

13:32.084 --> 13:35.018
I'm twenty two.

13:37.189 --> 13:39.189
Okay.

13:39.191 --> 13:41.558
Well, we're going
to the Stoke place tomorrow,

13:41.560 --> 13:42.992
if you wanna chill.

13:42.994 --> 13:46.062
It's this old farmhouse
outside of town.

13:47.999 --> 13:49.699
No one goes there.

13:49.701 --> 13:52.569
So we can talk
about monsters.

13:52.571 --> 13:54.871
And other
non-freak things.

13:58.210 --> 13:59.676
I...

13:59.678 --> 14:01.411
I think I'd like that.

14:03.081 --> 14:05.248
It's $37.08.

14:05.250 --> 14:07.383
But for the beer,
I need to see some ID.

14:11.756 --> 14:13.890
ID?

14:23.735 --> 14:25.635
Kohonta.

14:25.637 --> 14:27.370
Gesundheit.

14:27.372 --> 14:29.639
No, not --

14:29.641 --> 14:31.207
Kohonta.

14:31.209 --> 14:33.309
It's a -- It's a local
Native American legend.

14:33.311 --> 14:35.945
I can't find much about it,
but they're sort of...

14:35.947 --> 14:38.148
twisted monsters
that roam the woods

14:38.150 --> 14:41.584
"driven to consume
sweet mortal flesh."

14:41.586 --> 14:43.820
- You think this is our Hot Lips?
- Could be.

14:43.822 --> 14:45.455
I mean, according
to the lore,

14:45.457 --> 14:48.892
Kohonta get so starving,
they spit up stomach acid.

14:48.894 --> 14:50.293
Mm. Gross.

14:50.295 --> 14:51.561
Yeah.

14:51.563 --> 14:53.830
If that is our monster,
it's old...

14:53.832 --> 14:56.499
and...
hungry.

15:13.185 --> 15:15.285
How much longer?

15:15.287 --> 15:17.387
Keep up, old man.

15:26.865 --> 15:28.097
What was that?

15:28.099 --> 15:30.934
Nothing.
It's just the wind.

15:41.880 --> 15:43.913
We should head back.

15:58.029 --> 15:59.462
Sara?

16:03.702 --> 16:05.668
Hey!
Who the hell are you?!

16:09.808 --> 16:11.908
I'm talking to <i>you,</i> freak!
I --

16:13.378 --> 16:15.578
Sara, run!

16:49.153 --> 16:52.588
Hey, did you know when some
animals get a taste of people,

16:52.590 --> 16:54.290
that's all
they'll want to hunt?

16:54.292 --> 16:56.959
I mean, I'm reading on here
that tigers, even bears --

16:56.961 --> 16:59.228
Tom, you've got to stop.

16:59.230 --> 17:01.330
You won't let me talk
to Barbara's parents.

17:01.332 --> 17:03.799
I have to do <i>something.</i>

17:03.801 --> 17:05.501
You said it was
a coyote, right?

17:05.502 --> 17:08.838
Barbara!

17:10.742 --> 17:12.441
Yeah. It was.

17:12.443 --> 17:17.279
Sheriff, there's a...
situation at Big Creek.

17:21.051 --> 17:23.118
It got somebody else,
didn't it?

17:32.463 --> 17:34.630
But did --
did they find him?

17:34.632 --> 17:36.532
No, not yet.

17:38.169 --> 17:40.636
Sara, what did you
see out there?

17:40.638 --> 17:43.539
There was this guy.

17:43.541 --> 17:46.142
I think...it was a guy.

17:46.144 --> 17:49.879
He looked like he was
covered in something.

17:49.881 --> 17:52.048
And...

17:52.050 --> 17:54.083
he was whistling.

17:55.319 --> 17:57.787
I ran, but Fitz, he...

17:57.789 --> 18:00.156
Can you tell us
exactly where you were

18:00.158 --> 18:02.658
when this thing
attacked you?

18:05.129 --> 18:06.629
I think...

18:06.631 --> 18:09.498
a few miles past
the old Parker cabin.

18:09.500 --> 18:11.067
Parker?

18:20.078 --> 18:22.178
Okay, wrap it up!

18:22.180 --> 18:24.747
Sheriff, we've got
a search party out there.

18:24.749 --> 18:27.850
Not anymore. You're bringing
everybody in. Now.

18:27.852 --> 18:29.185
What's going on?

18:29.187 --> 18:31.887
What does it look like?
We're done here.

18:31.889 --> 18:35.024
I'm not wasting time and money
hunting for a rabid coyote.

18:35.026 --> 18:37.159
Okay, Sheriff, this wasn't
an animal attack.

18:37.161 --> 18:38.828
Then what was it?

18:38.830 --> 18:40.696
Look, if you want to pull your
men out of there, that's fine.

18:40.698 --> 18:41.897
But we still need
to get in there.

18:41.899 --> 18:43.265
It's not happening.

18:43.267 --> 18:45.501
Look, I don't care
if you guys are the FBI.

18:45.503 --> 18:48.537
Nobody goes in those woods
without my say-so.

18:48.539 --> 18:50.873
Understood?
Mm-hmm.

18:50.875 --> 18:52.875
- Hm.
- Good.

18:52.877 --> 18:55.010
He wants us to call off...

18:55.012 --> 18:57.580
Well, we should probably
do what he says.

18:57.582 --> 19:00.349
Oh, yeah.
Definitely.

21:16.320 --> 21:17.987
Uh...

21:17.989 --> 21:20.556
No.
They don't have horns.

21:20.558 --> 21:22.524

21:22.526 --> 21:24.927

possessed a human.

21:43.748 --> 21:45.514
I've killed one.

21:47.752 --> 21:50.219
Yeah?

21:51.789 --> 21:53.088

21:55.059 --> 21:57.693

22:05.736 --> 22:08.470
You're not going to go swinging
some giant knife around.

22:08.472 --> 22:09.938
- I was just gonna --
- Remember that time

22:09.940 --> 22:11.573
you almost killed yourself
with a Slinky?

22:11.575 --> 22:12.941
I didn't.

22:12.943 --> 22:15.110
He tried to eat it.

22:15.112 --> 22:17.780
I was 3.

22:17.782 --> 22:19.481
So, how do you use it?

22:19.483 --> 22:24.086
Well, there are standard
hand-to-hand combat moves.

22:24.088 --> 22:25.754
Like a lightsaber.

22:25.756 --> 22:29.658
Or you can throw it,
like...this.

22:33.597 --> 22:35.964
Nice.

22:56.687 --> 22:58.954
That sheriff was definitely
hiding something.

22:58.956 --> 23:00.856
Yeah, either that
or he's scared.

23:00.858 --> 23:04.927
Oh, by the way, uh,
"Kohonta" means "whistler."

23:04.929 --> 23:06.962
All right.
How do we kill it?

23:06.964 --> 23:10.432
Well, here's the thing.
The lore doesn't really specify.

23:10.434 --> 23:15.137
Great. Well, my vote?
Shotgun, head, done.

23:38.796 --> 23:40.863
Drop your weapons!

23:50.708 --> 23:52.574
You boys don't listen,
do you?

23:52.576 --> 23:54.643
Told you.
Stay out of these woods!

23:54.645 --> 23:56.412
I don't care
if you're FBI.

23:56.414 --> 23:59.181
All right. Sheriff.
We're not FBI.

23:59.183 --> 24:01.350
Does the word "Kohonta"
mean anything to you?

24:05.723 --> 24:07.756
No.

24:07.758 --> 24:10.692
- You're lyin'.
- I'm not.

24:10.694 --> 24:12.828
You're coming in with me.

24:12.830 --> 24:14.763
Move.

24:14.765 --> 24:16.432
Now!

24:22.740 --> 24:25.374
Sorry, Sheriff.

24:29.413 --> 24:31.447
Getting closer.

24:31.449 --> 24:33.549
I-I'm just
a little rusty.

24:33.551 --> 24:34.917
Mm-hmm.

24:34.919 --> 24:36.552
It's cool if you
can't do it, dude.

24:36.554 --> 24:38.587
I can do it, okay?

24:38.589 --> 24:41.557
Just...watch.

24:50.067 --> 24:52.134
- What...
- The... - Hell?

24:58.275 --> 24:59.641
Dude!

24:59.643 --> 25:02.044
Are you like...

25:02.046 --> 25:03.912
a Jedi or something?

25:03.914 --> 25:05.080
Kinda.

25:07.084 --> 25:08.817
Watch this.

25:29.773 --> 25:31.340
Holy...

25:40.518 --> 25:43.619
This is so cool.

25:47.825 --> 25:48.924
Max?

25:48.926 --> 25:51.493
Uh...

25:51.495 --> 25:53.195
Okay, Jack.
Cut it out.

25:53.197 --> 25:56.131
Don't worry. You're safe.
Look.

25:56.133 --> 25:58.700
Whoa. Jack.

25:58.702 --> 26:00.202
I can control it.

26:00.204 --> 26:02.804
I don't care!
Just stop!

26:02.806 --> 26:04.773
Jack?

26:04.775 --> 26:06.008
What?

26:07.878 --> 26:10.212
Seriously, Jack!
Stop!

26:10.214 --> 26:11.313
Stacy!

26:22.359 --> 26:24.960
No, no, no, no, no, no.

26:29.466 --> 26:32.167
- Stacy!
- Oh, God! Oh, God!

26:34.405 --> 26:36.004
It's okay, it's okay.

26:37.841 --> 26:40.509
E-Eliot, go call 911.

26:40.511 --> 26:44.179
It's okay.
You stay with me, okay?

26:44.181 --> 26:45.514
Please.

26:45.516 --> 26:46.848
I was in control.

26:46.850 --> 26:48.850
E-Everything was fine.
She moved.

26:48.852 --> 26:51.253
Get away from her!

26:51.255 --> 26:52.654
<i>911.</i>
<i>What's your emergency?</i>

26:52.656 --> 26:56.358
Stacy. It's okay.
I'm here. Okay? Okay?

26:56.360 --> 26:58.660
Stacy. Please.

26:58.662 --> 27:01.029
I can fix this.

27:04.368 --> 27:06.535
What are you doing?!

27:06.537 --> 27:07.936
Trust me. Okay.

27:27.124 --> 27:30.058
<i>Sir? Sir? Hello?</i>
<i>Are you still there?</i>

27:32.730 --> 27:34.096
Stace?

27:48.278 --> 27:50.612
How?

27:50.614 --> 27:53.115
I-I fixed you.

28:01.992 --> 28:03.725
Don't.

28:05.929 --> 28:10.265
But she's okay.
Everything's fine. Right?

28:10.267 --> 28:11.900
No!

28:11.902 --> 28:14.436
Okay?
Just...get away.

28:23.280 --> 28:24.613
Eliot?

28:24.615 --> 28:27.749
I don't know...

28:27.751 --> 28:29.584
<i>what</i> you are.

28:33.023 --> 28:35.023
But stay away.

28:46.998 --> 28:48.598
We hunt things.

28:48.600 --> 28:51.034
Fight things and kill things
people don't understand.

28:51.036 --> 28:53.603
So...

28:53.605 --> 28:55.104
Kohonta.

28:55.106 --> 28:57.240
Talk.

29:01.780 --> 29:03.613
Uh...

29:03.615 --> 29:05.081
I-I...

29:05.083 --> 29:07.016
I didn't think
it was real.

29:07.018 --> 29:11.054
The Kohonta was a tribal legend,
an old story.

29:11.056 --> 29:12.956
I haven't heard about it
since I was a kid.

29:12.958 --> 29:15.558
But then I s-saw it

29:15.560 --> 29:18.294
the night
Barbara was killed.

29:19.798 --> 29:21.831
Wait a second.
So that's why you've been

29:21.833 --> 29:23.833
trying to keep people
out of the woods?

29:23.835 --> 29:25.501
So what the hell
is this thing?

29:25.503 --> 29:29.639
It's not <i>what.</i> Who.

29:29.641 --> 29:33.810
The Parker family,
they were some

29:33.812 --> 29:36.746
of the first white settlers
around here.

29:36.748 --> 29:40.483
They set a homestead up
in these woods -- the cabin.

29:40.485 --> 29:42.318
And then?

29:42.320 --> 29:44.754
Things went bad.

29:44.756 --> 29:47.557
There was a hard winter.

29:47.559 --> 29:51.928
Their oldest son, Henry,
survived...

29:51.930 --> 29:53.830
but he did things.

29:53.832 --> 29:56.432
What kind of things?
Like Donner Party?

29:56.434 --> 29:57.934
Pretty much.

29:57.936 --> 30:00.703
They say that boy
not only ate his family,

30:00.705 --> 30:05.341
they said he went...
mad with hunger.

30:07.279 --> 30:09.545
He went after my people,

30:09.547 --> 30:12.448
and then when my tribe
caught him, they...

30:16.554 --> 30:19.022
Killing him
would have been too easy.

30:19.024 --> 30:22.125
They wanted that boy to suffer.

30:22.127 --> 30:24.294
For his crimes
against our people,

30:24.296 --> 30:26.396
crimes against nature.

30:26.398 --> 30:29.065
They cursed him.

30:30.435 --> 30:31.801
He's doomed
to roam the woods...

30:33.872 --> 30:35.738
...always starving.

30:37.042 --> 30:38.875
And if he didn't feed...

30:41.413 --> 30:43.479
...his body would eat itself.

30:47.719 --> 30:50.153
The Kohonta aren't born.

30:52.090 --> 30:54.657
They're made.

30:54.659 --> 30:57.727
So they just let some
flesh-eating freak loose?

30:57.729 --> 31:00.563
They bound him
to this forest.

31:00.565 --> 31:03.066
They marked the trees
to keep folks away.

31:03.068 --> 31:04.901
But that was
a long time ago.

31:04.903 --> 31:06.269
Yeah, people forget.

31:06.271 --> 31:08.237
- Even me.
- Well, it's a good thing.

31:08.239 --> 31:10.273
Like I said,
we hunt these things.

31:10.275 --> 31:13.976
- What do you mean?
- Kohonta, werewolves, demons.

31:13.978 --> 31:15.866
Those are real?

31:15.867 --> 31:19.202
Oh, yeah. Yeah.
And we kill 'em.

31:19.204 --> 31:20.804
You --
Just the two of you?

31:20.806 --> 31:22.872
- We know what we're doing.
- Do you?

31:22.874 --> 31:25.008
Look, if those monsters
are out there,

31:25.010 --> 31:26.509
why don't you tell people?

31:26.511 --> 31:29.479
Give them -- well, us --
a chance to fight back?

31:30.816 --> 31:33.316
Because telling people
about this stuff --

31:33.318 --> 31:35.118
they don't always believe.

31:35.120 --> 31:37.353
Your people tried to warn you
about this whistling freak.

31:37.355 --> 31:39.389
Nobody bought it.
Not even you.

31:39.391 --> 31:40.957
So?

31:40.959 --> 31:43.493
Just record them,
put it on YouTube.

31:43.495 --> 31:45.462
Knowing about monsters
and fighting 'em

31:45.464 --> 31:46.830
are two different things.

31:46.832 --> 31:49.065
So you make that choice
for everybody?

31:49.067 --> 31:50.834
Imagine telling them.

31:50.836 --> 31:52.869
Imagine the lives
you could save.

31:52.871 --> 31:56.306
No. No.

31:56.308 --> 31:59.075
It doesn't work
like that.

31:59.077 --> 32:01.177
People die.

32:01.179 --> 32:03.379
Even when they know
how to fight,

32:03.381 --> 32:05.181
people still die.

32:15.193 --> 32:17.560
Tom.

32:17.562 --> 32:19.929
- I can't do this anymore.
- Where are you?

32:19.931 --> 32:21.364
<i>Just listen.</i>

32:21.366 --> 32:25.001
Whatever's out there...
I just want you to know

32:25.003 --> 32:27.003
I'm going to find it...

32:27.005 --> 32:29.272
and kill it.
Tom!

32:29.274 --> 32:31.274
<i>No! To--</i>

32:52.631 --> 32:55.231
He's alone out there.
We gotta find him.

32:55.233 --> 32:57.100
- Okay, slow down.
- Look, I-I lied to him.

32:57.102 --> 32:58.902
I told him
it was a coyote.

32:58.904 --> 33:00.737
Listen. We're gonna help you
protect your son, okay?

33:00.739 --> 33:02.372
We're not entirely sure
how to kill this thing.

33:02.374 --> 33:03.940
I am. Look.

33:03.942 --> 33:06.743
The story says a silver blade
through the heart.

33:06.745 --> 33:10.380
Silver blade. Can do.

34:46.500 --> 34:49.835
Thomas!

34:49.837 --> 34:51.570
Thomas!

35:07.821 --> 35:10.188
Hey!

35:20.367 --> 35:22.568
Aaah!

35:48.963 --> 35:50.862
Go! Go!

35:52.700 --> 35:54.700
Whoa.

35:54.702 --> 35:58.403
You don't like that, huh?
Come on!

36:03.110 --> 36:04.376
Yeah.

36:04.378 --> 36:05.777
Come on, come on.

36:05.779 --> 36:08.213
Aaah!

36:29.903 --> 36:31.503
Whoa.

36:34.441 --> 36:36.608
That was like
full-on "Raiders."

36:38.445 --> 36:39.611
Tom.

36:44.151 --> 36:46.151
He's alive.

36:58.371 --> 37:00.138
- Easy.
- D-Dad?

37:00.140 --> 37:01.473
Thomas.

37:03.276 --> 37:05.410
Did we get it?

37:05.412 --> 37:07.278
The coyote?

37:09.549 --> 37:12.784
- Okay...ready?
- Yeah.

37:15.789 --> 37:17.822
You want an ambulance
for <i>you?</i>

37:19.493 --> 37:21.626
I didn't know
what to tell him.

37:23.630 --> 37:25.330
How about the truth?

37:26.466 --> 37:28.600
He's your son.

37:31.104 --> 37:32.971
He deserves the truth.

37:57.297 --> 38:00.865
So, telling the kid --
you think that's the best idea?

38:00.867 --> 38:03.868
What? You don't?

38:03.870 --> 38:06.337
It doesn't make his life
any better, you know?

38:06.339 --> 38:09.307
Do what we always do.
When in doubt, lie.

38:09.309 --> 38:11.976
Yeah, right.

38:11.978 --> 38:14.546
Like we did with Jack?

38:14.548 --> 38:16.648
I took care of it, okay?
We took care of it.

38:16.650 --> 38:18.416
No, no, Dean.
<i>We</i> did not take care of it.

38:18.418 --> 38:20.752
<i>You</i> did.

38:20.754 --> 38:24.055
And do you think you really
took care of it the right way?

38:24.057 --> 38:25.823
Jack said he was fine.

38:25.825 --> 38:28.092
Yeah. He's a kid.

38:28.094 --> 38:29.827
And when we were kids,

38:29.829 --> 38:31.763
how many times did we tell Dad
that we were fine

38:31.765 --> 38:34.198
just to make him happy?

39:00.026 --> 39:02.594
Hey, kid.
We're back.

39:02.596 --> 39:03.861
You still at it?

39:03.863 --> 39:06.264
Almost there.
How was the Hunt?

39:06.266 --> 39:09.300
Oh.
Uh...disgusting.

39:09.302 --> 39:12.403
Oh. Well, I got
the supplies.

39:12.405 --> 39:15.440
Except for the beer.

39:15.442 --> 39:16.774
I didn't have ID.

39:16.776 --> 39:18.743
- You have tons of IDs.
- They're fake.

39:20.780 --> 39:24.048
Jack...listen.

39:24.050 --> 39:26.150
Dean and I, we --
we want to talk to you

39:26.152 --> 39:28.119
about your powers.

39:28.121 --> 39:29.921
W-What about them?

39:29.923 --> 39:32.457
This Hunt, we, uh...
we didn't want you coming along

39:32.459 --> 39:34.726
because we didn't
want you using them.

39:34.728 --> 39:38.162
Not yet.
Not for now.

39:38.164 --> 39:40.431
You know, you just
got 'em back, Jack.

39:40.433 --> 39:42.333
We want to make sure you're
comfortable with them again

39:42.335 --> 39:43.735
before you...

39:43.737 --> 39:45.336
Before you go
all X-Men.

39:46.773 --> 39:48.606
It was crappy of us
not to tell you.

39:48.608 --> 39:50.908
You know, we were
trying to be nice.

39:50.910 --> 39:52.577
'Cause we care
about you.

39:52.579 --> 39:55.680
But because we care about you,
you deserve the truth.

40:00.353 --> 40:02.353
You understand that?

40:06.826 --> 40:08.393
Jack?

40:09.929 --> 40:12.664
I understand.

40:12.666 --> 40:16.768
I won't use my powers
without permission.

40:16.770 --> 40:19.937
Promise.

40:19.939 --> 40:21.539
Great.

40:21.541 --> 40:24.042
And I guess I'll go
get some beer.

40:28.882 --> 40:30.648
What about everything else?
You good?

40:30.650 --> 40:32.650
I mean, anything happen
while we were gone?

40:32.652 --> 40:34.118
No.

40:36.122 --> 40:37.655
Nothin'.

40:37.657 --> 40:39.457
Good.
