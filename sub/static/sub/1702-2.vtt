WEBVTT

00:02.168 --> 00:04.503
All right, they got water,
orange juice...

00:04.879 --> 00:07.256
...and what looks like cider.

00:07.757 --> 00:08.799
Taste it.

00:13.930 --> 00:14.930
Yeah, it's fat.

00:15.181 --> 00:16.473
I drank fat!

00:18.226 --> 00:20.269
I know, I did that two minutes ago.

00:22.897 --> 00:23.939
Hey.

00:24.149 --> 00:25.607
Hey, Mr. Tux.

00:26.109 --> 00:28.444
- Why aren't you dressed?
- We have a half-hour.

00:28.695 --> 00:31.822
That was four minutes ago.
We have to be out the door at 20 to 8.

00:32.073 --> 00:35.576
Relax, we'll be ready. It takes us
two minutes to get dressed.

00:35.827 --> 00:37.995
I'd feel better if you
got dressed now.

00:38.496 --> 00:39.913
- Okay.
- Okay.

00:42.667 --> 00:43.709
Hey!

00:43.877 --> 00:45.794
Oh, look at you, all sexy.

00:46.046 --> 00:47.087
Really?

00:48.631 --> 00:50.007
Wow!

00:50.925 --> 00:52.051
- Hi.
- Hi.

00:52.302 --> 00:57.181
- How come you didn't come over earlier?
- Because I'm a stupid, stupid man.

00:58.725 --> 01:00.476
Hey, Ross, want some cider?

01:00.727 --> 01:01.769
No.

01:03.146 --> 01:04.897
So you're pretty close, huh?

01:05.105 --> 01:06.940
Makeup's on. Hair's done.

01:07.192 --> 01:08.567
I just have to get dressed.

01:08.818 --> 01:11.612
And that takes, what?
Just 6 or 7 minutes?

01:11.863 --> 01:14.239
Yeah. Once I figure out
what I'm wearing.

01:17.035 --> 01:18.202
Glass of fat?

01:19.996 --> 01:22.164
The One Where No One's Ready

02:08.169 --> 02:11.045
What's the matter?
You nervous about your speech?

02:11.297 --> 02:12.673
Nope.

02:14.217 --> 02:16.135
- You wanna hear it?
- Am I in it?

02:18.179 --> 02:19.221
Uh-huh.

02:21.057 --> 02:23.976
After I thank everyone
for donating to the museum...

02:24.227 --> 02:26.979
...I sing a song about the wonder
that is Joey.

02:28.815 --> 02:29.857
- Hello.
- Hey.

02:30.024 --> 02:31.066
Whoa!

02:31.234 --> 02:32.693
Hello! You look great!

02:32.944 --> 02:35.070
Thank you. I know, though.

02:36.698 --> 02:40.534
You see this? This is a person
who is ready to go.

02:40.743 --> 02:41.952
Phoebe, you...

02:42.453 --> 02:43.579
You are my star.

02:43.913 --> 02:46.915
Aw. Well, you're my lucky penny.

02:49.878 --> 02:55.007
All right, I took the quiz, and it
turns out I do put career before men.

02:57.760 --> 02:58.802
Get up.

02:59.220 --> 03:00.262
What?

03:00.680 --> 03:03.223
- You're in my seat.
- How is this your seat?

03:06.686 --> 03:07.936
I was sitting there.

03:08.104 --> 03:09.605
But then you left.

03:10.190 --> 03:12.733
Well, it's not like I went to Spain.

03:13.568 --> 03:15.903
I went to the bathroom.
You knew I'd be back.

03:16.112 --> 03:17.946
What's the big deal?
Sit somewhere else!

03:18.114 --> 03:21.700
The "big deal" is, I was sitting
there last! So...

03:21.951 --> 03:23.243
...it's my seat.

03:23.786 --> 03:27.956
Well, actually, the last place
you were sitting was in there, so...

03:28.458 --> 03:31.001
You guys, you know what?
It doesn't matter.

03:31.252 --> 03:35.797
You both have to go get dressed before
the big vein in my head pops.

03:36.049 --> 03:38.800
I just have to do one thing.
It's not a big deal.

03:39.093 --> 03:40.219
Get up!

03:42.013 --> 03:43.055
- Hi.
- Hey.

03:43.264 --> 03:45.515
Ooh. Phoebe, you look great!

03:46.142 --> 03:47.976
All right already.

03:48.895 --> 03:50.771
Ooh. Are you gonna do magic?

03:53.274 --> 03:55.067
That's funny. Change.

03:55.276 --> 03:57.152
- Hang on, I just got in.
- I don't care.

03:57.445 --> 03:59.238
It starts at 8.
We can't be late.

03:59.489 --> 04:02.324
"He could not, would not,
want to wait."

04:03.076 --> 04:05.827
Our table is down in front.
My boss will be there.

04:06.079 --> 04:08.455
Everyone will see if we arrive
after it starts.

04:08.665 --> 04:10.666
Has somebody been drinking my fat?

04:12.252 --> 04:16.004
Does this look like something a
paleontologist's girlfriend would wear?

04:16.255 --> 04:18.839
I don't know.
You might be the first one.

04:20.134 --> 04:22.344
- Rach, did you check the machine?
- No.

04:22.762 --> 04:26.682
Wait. This is the outfit that makes
my calves look fat. Never mind.

04:30.561 --> 04:33.438
Well, Joey, I wrote
a little song today.

04:33.856 --> 04:35.190
It's called, "Get up!"

04:36.442 --> 04:39.111
All right. You can have the chair.

04:39.320 --> 04:42.531
- Really?
- Oh, my. Would you look at that?

04:46.661 --> 04:48.161
I'm coming over.

04:48.371 --> 04:50.998
What if I'm already there
when you play this message?

04:51.207 --> 04:53.125
Is that too spooky?

04:55.169 --> 04:57.671
Hi, Rach, are you there?
It's me. Pick up.

04:58.131 --> 04:59.881
Rachel? Rach?

05:00.383 --> 05:01.633
What?

05:03.136 --> 05:04.177
Never mind.

05:06.556 --> 05:09.057
Monica, it's Richard. Call me.

05:12.729 --> 05:14.229
Is that message old or new?

05:15.732 --> 05:17.357
Old or new? Old or new?

05:17.608 --> 05:20.402
It's definitely old.
Didn't you hear the double beep?

05:20.695 --> 05:23.071
What if it's new?
We agreed not to talk.

05:23.239 --> 05:26.074
It could be important.
Shouldn't I call him back?

05:26.326 --> 05:28.702
Honey, you did call him back.
It's old.

05:28.911 --> 05:30.996
Yeah, see, Mon, listen. Listen.

05:31.205 --> 05:33.332
When Carol and I broke up...

05:33.583 --> 05:36.626
...I went through the same thing.
You know what I did?

05:36.836 --> 05:38.837
I got dressed.

05:41.424 --> 05:44.343
Really, really quickly, okay? Okay?

05:44.552 --> 05:46.595
There we go. There we go.

05:47.347 --> 05:49.765
You know what? Don't get up.
Just sit there.

05:50.058 --> 05:53.101
I just hope you don't mind
my hand right here.

05:54.395 --> 05:57.731
Not touching. Can't get mad!
Not touching. Can't get mad!

05:57.940 --> 06:00.108
Not touching. Can't get mad!

06:00.360 --> 06:02.736
Oh! Oh, my God!

06:03.196 --> 06:04.613
You rotten boys!

06:05.782 --> 06:08.033
- Sorry, Phoebe.
- What am I gonna do?

06:08.284 --> 06:10.118
Don't rub it!
What gets out hummus?

06:10.370 --> 06:12.037
What gets out hummus?

06:12.538 --> 06:14.581
Monica!
What gets out hummus?

06:15.625 --> 06:18.960
If it is a new message,
what is he calling to say?

06:19.796 --> 06:22.047
Okay, thanks. Yeah, I'll try that.

06:23.633 --> 06:25.801
Maybe he called to say
you're obsessive and crazy?

06:26.094 --> 06:28.303
- So should I call him back?
- No!

06:29.680 --> 06:30.722
No!

06:32.809 --> 06:35.811
- Fine, we'll both sit in the chair.
- Fine with me.

06:39.690 --> 06:42.067
I am so comfortable.

06:43.319 --> 06:44.319
Me too.

06:44.654 --> 06:48.198
In fact, I think I might be
a little too comfortable.

06:52.328 --> 06:55.914
Okay, we have 19 minutes.
I want you to go and change.

06:56.165 --> 07:00.335
When you come back, Joey will go change,
and he'll have vacated the chair.

07:00.753 --> 07:01.837
- Okay.
- All right.

07:02.088 --> 07:03.630
Fine. I'm going.

07:03.840 --> 07:07.426
When I get back, it's Chair City.
And I'm the guy...

07:07.635 --> 07:09.344
...who's sitting in a chair!

07:11.472 --> 07:12.806
Is this a little too...?

07:13.015 --> 07:15.016
Pheebs? What happened?

07:15.268 --> 07:16.518
I got the hummus.

07:16.811 --> 07:20.772
Oh, honey, we'll find you something.
You wanna wear my black jacket?

07:20.982 --> 07:23.191
- It won't go with this dress.
- You're right.

07:23.443 --> 07:27.821
- Well, let's just get you out of that.
- No, no, no. Not out of that.

07:28.030 --> 07:30.949
- Not out of clothes.
- Can Phoebe borrow your green dress?

07:31.117 --> 07:32.159
I called him.

07:33.619 --> 07:36.746
Yes. I got his machine
and I left a message.

07:36.998 --> 07:38.457
But it's okay. It's okay...

07:38.708 --> 07:41.877
...because it was, like,
a casual, breezy message.

07:42.128 --> 07:43.170
It was breezy.

07:44.046 --> 07:45.964
Oh, God, what if it wasn't breezy?

07:46.174 --> 07:50.552
How could it not be breezy? No,
because you're in such a breezy place.

07:51.304 --> 07:55.515
I got it. I'll play my message, and
you guys tell me if it's breezy enough.

07:55.725 --> 07:57.809
But how you gonna do that?

07:58.394 --> 08:00.896
I know the code
to his answering machine.

08:01.147 --> 08:03.690
Okay, Mon, I really don't think
this is the...

08:03.900 --> 08:06.651
Okay, you're dialing.
You are dialing.

08:16.829 --> 08:19.539
Hi, this is Richard.
Please leave a message at the tone.

08:21.876 --> 08:23.585
You have two new messages.

08:24.045 --> 08:25.420
What a cool job.

08:25.713 --> 08:27.672
"You have two new messages."

08:29.550 --> 08:31.843
Please pass the pie.

08:34.179 --> 08:36.806
Hi, it's Monica.
I'm just checking in.

08:37.015 --> 08:40.268
I got a message and didn't know
if it was old or new...

08:40.520 --> 08:42.520
...so I'm just checking.

08:42.730 --> 08:44.356
So let me know.

08:44.607 --> 08:45.941
Or don't. Whatever.

08:46.234 --> 08:47.776
I'm breezy!

08:49.195 --> 08:52.614
You can't say you're "breezy."
That negates the "breezy."

08:54.909 --> 08:57.869
Hola. It's me.
Yesterday was really fun.

08:58.579 --> 09:00.830
Call me about this weekend, okay?

09:04.126 --> 09:05.752
Now, she sounded breezy.

09:09.465 --> 09:13.134
He's seeing someone.
I can't believe he's seeing someone.

09:13.386 --> 09:15.971
- You don't know that.
- Well, whose voice was that?

09:16.138 --> 09:19.140
Maybe it was his sister's.
Maybe it was his daughter's.

09:20.518 --> 09:23.812
Michelle. Of course!
Did it sound like Michelle?

09:24.480 --> 09:28.483
Oh, great. It's starting to rain.
That'll make it easier to get a cab.

09:29.485 --> 09:30.485
It was Michelle.

09:30.695 --> 09:32.404
It was definitely Michelle.

09:32.655 --> 09:36.825
Try Monica's green dress. If it
doesn't fit, wear my gray silk one.

09:37.118 --> 09:39.661
- Unless I wear it.
- You don't know what you're wearing?

09:39.870 --> 09:42.497
I'm just trying to look nice
for your big night.

09:42.707 --> 09:45.375
Yeah, which we have to leave for
in 12 minutes.

09:45.668 --> 09:48.378
Come on, I'll just pick
something out for you.

09:48.671 --> 09:50.880
You'll notice that I'm fully dressed.

09:51.173 --> 09:54.509
I, in turn, have noticed
that you are not.

09:54.760 --> 09:59.556
So in the words of A.A. Milne,
"Get out of my chair, dill-hole."

10:02.018 --> 10:03.393
Okay.

10:11.068 --> 10:13.695
- What are you doing?
- You said to give you the chair.

10:13.946 --> 10:16.031
You didn't say anything about cushions.

10:16.198 --> 10:17.907
They're the essence
of the chair!

10:18.200 --> 10:20.785
That's right! I'm taking the essence.

10:21.871 --> 10:23.705
Oh, he'll be back.

10:23.914 --> 10:26.374
Oh, there's nobody in the room.

10:27.043 --> 10:30.670
- I'm sorry, I thought it looked pretty.
- That was a Halloween costume.

10:30.880 --> 10:34.215
Unless you would like me to go
as Little Bo Peep.

10:34.675 --> 10:37.385
I didn't recognize it
without that inflatable sheep.

10:37.678 --> 10:41.431
Yeah, which, by the way, Chandler,
I would like back one of these days.

10:44.060 --> 10:46.728
Rach, good! Listen, isn't this
perfect for me?

10:46.937 --> 10:49.272
Oh, it's perfect! But not for tonight.

10:49.565 --> 10:52.901
Of course not for tonight.
Hi. I'm going to a benefit.

10:53.110 --> 10:55.236
Not for tonight?
What are you doing?

10:55.446 --> 10:58.782
No, I'm sorry. We didn't mean it.
I love you. Breathe.

11:00.201 --> 11:03.203
We used them as pillows
when we went camping.

11:03.412 --> 11:04.412
What?

11:05.414 --> 11:06.581
The sheep.

11:08.000 --> 11:10.794
Hey, what you do on your own time...

11:14.465 --> 11:16.925
- Where's my underwear?
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

11:17.093 --> 11:20.595
- Come on, you took his underwear?
- He took my essence!

11:20.805 --> 11:25.642
Okay, hold on. Why can't you just wear
the underwear you're wearing now?

11:25.935 --> 11:28.520
Because I'm not wearing
any underwear now.

11:29.730 --> 11:32.107
Then why do you have
to wear underwear tonight?

11:32.358 --> 11:34.109
It's a rented tux, okay?

11:34.360 --> 11:37.654
I'm not gonna go "commando"
in another man's fatigues.

11:39.990 --> 11:43.451
Then somebody's gonna have
to give somebody back his cushions.

11:44.286 --> 11:48.456
Okay. You hide my clothes. I'm gonna
do the exact opposite to you.

11:50.793 --> 11:53.878
What, are you gonna show me my clothes?

11:54.130 --> 11:55.547
Hey, opposite...

11:56.549 --> 11:57.799
...is opposite.

11:59.635 --> 12:01.261
He's got nothing!

12:02.138 --> 12:03.680
Okay, I'm ready.

12:08.978 --> 12:12.147
Rachel didn't have anything I liked
but this ribbon.

12:12.356 --> 12:14.816
I thought, all right,
I'll be political.

12:16.569 --> 12:19.654
- What are you supporting?
- Christmas.

12:21.157 --> 12:26.161
Hey, that's okay with me. Two down,
and I have exactly 12 minutes...

12:26.662 --> 12:27.662
What?

12:28.706 --> 12:31.291
My watch stopped.
My watch. Okay, see...

12:31.500 --> 12:34.335
...the dinosaur tail
isn't going around anymore.

12:35.004 --> 12:37.589
What time is it? It's 7:33.
I have 7 minutes.

12:37.840 --> 12:39.007
I have seven minutes!

12:39.175 --> 12:42.177
Which shoes should I wear?
The black or the purple?

12:42.511 --> 12:44.888
- Just pick one, okay?
- Oh, okay, okay. The black.

12:45.097 --> 12:47.390
Do you have black
with little strappies?

12:47.683 --> 12:51.686
Yeah, but those go better with pants.
Maybe I should wear pants.

12:52.188 --> 12:56.816
Yeah, pants! What an idea!
Or better yet, go without pants.

12:57.026 --> 13:00.111
I don't know what you're doing
but just get in there...

13:00.362 --> 13:02.864
...and pick out any shoes
that fit your feet.

13:03.032 --> 13:06.534
I don't care if they match.
I don't care if they make...

13:06.744 --> 13:11.372
...your ankles or your knees or your
earlobes look fat. Just do it!

13:11.582 --> 13:14.250
Go in there, pick something out
so we can go.

13:17.046 --> 13:19.547
- All right.
- Thank you.

13:20.424 --> 13:24.093
I've got to call Michelle to see
if that was her voice.

13:24.345 --> 13:26.221
It was. It was her voice.

13:26.472 --> 13:29.557
Monica, I think you've gone over
to the bad place.

13:33.562 --> 13:35.396
Hola.

13:35.731 --> 13:38.066
Hello? Hello?

13:39.401 --> 13:42.487
- Okay. That was her, right?
- Definitely. Yeah.

13:42.738 --> 13:44.572
So there you go. Whew!

13:44.740 --> 13:48.076
We're out of the woods.
I think I'll get dressed now.

13:49.620 --> 13:51.412
- I'll get it.
- Okay.

13:52.665 --> 13:54.123
Hi, Monica and Rachel's.

13:54.625 --> 13:57.669
Yeah, just a second.
Can I ask who's calling?

13:57.962 --> 13:59.254
Ooh! It's Michelle! Ooh!

14:01.465 --> 14:05.426
She must have that "caller I.D." thing.
You should get that.

14:08.430 --> 14:09.472
Michelle?

14:09.932 --> 14:13.935
Yeah, that was me.
I dialed your number by mistake.

14:14.186 --> 14:15.311
Just try to be...

14:17.314 --> 14:18.773
You're so sweet.

14:19.441 --> 14:21.484
Yeah, we were a great couple.

14:21.819 --> 14:23.695
I know, I really miss him.

14:24.280 --> 14:26.906
Well, you know how it is.
It's just that...

14:27.116 --> 14:28.783
You know what's weird?

14:30.703 --> 14:32.787
Donald Duck never wore pants.

14:34.290 --> 14:36.124
But when he gets
out of the shower...

14:36.333 --> 14:38.960
...he always puts a towel
around his waist.

14:41.630 --> 14:43.923
I mean, what is that about?

14:45.509 --> 14:48.428
I only beeped in so I could
hear my own message.

14:48.637 --> 14:49.971
I mean, that's allowed.

14:50.306 --> 14:51.472
Yeah!

14:52.725 --> 14:57.061
I would really appreciate it if you
wouldn't tell your dad about...

14:57.313 --> 15:00.481
What do you mean, you don't feel
comfortable with this? We're friends!

15:02.943 --> 15:04.861
That bitch always hated me.

15:05.154 --> 15:08.573
- I'm calling her back.
- No, no, no! Tick, tick, tick.

15:08.741 --> 15:10.491
- Okay, fine.
- Okay.

15:11.827 --> 15:15.163
- She's got a phone in there, right?
- Okay, we're on it.

15:24.423 --> 15:26.007
Um, heh, heh...

15:26.175 --> 15:29.844
I know it says, "black tie optional"...

15:30.095 --> 15:32.764
...but this may be pushing it a little.

15:33.182 --> 15:34.849
I'm not gonna go.

15:37.019 --> 15:38.227
You're not gonna go?

15:38.520 --> 15:42.190
No, I think I'm gonna catch up
on my correspondence.

15:43.609 --> 15:46.527
How can you not be going?

15:47.237 --> 15:48.529
I'm not gonna go.

15:48.781 --> 15:52.533
So I think that will accomplish
the "not going."

15:57.414 --> 15:59.749
Um, you know, just out of curiosity...

16:00.209 --> 16:03.503
Ever since I was humiliated
and yelled at in front of my friends...

16:03.712 --> 16:08.132
...I'm just, I don't know, not in a
very museum benefit-y kind of mood.

16:08.384 --> 16:12.387
Right. Well, okay. Okay.
God, I'm sorry. I'm sorry I yelled.

16:12.596 --> 16:14.806
- That's fine.
- No, but you're mad.

16:15.057 --> 16:17.016
I'm not mad. I'm just not going.

16:17.226 --> 16:18.726
- Right.
- Okay.

16:20.020 --> 16:23.064
- You know that I have to go, right?
- Mm-hm.

16:23.315 --> 16:27.777
So is it gonna be like
I'm abandoning you while you're upset?

16:27.945 --> 16:28.987
- No.
- No?

16:29.154 --> 16:33.241
- You're not upset about the yelling.
- Right. And the humiliating.

16:33.450 --> 16:35.576
Well, of course, the humiliating.

16:37.621 --> 16:38.663
So we...

16:39.248 --> 16:40.415
...we're okay?

16:40.624 --> 16:42.625
- We're good.
- Right.

16:46.046 --> 16:48.256
- Honey? I love you.
- Yes, Ross.

16:49.758 --> 16:51.467
Get away from that phone!

16:54.179 --> 16:56.180
She's just getting dressed now.

16:59.351 --> 17:02.645
Is it wrong that I was
totally aroused by that?

17:10.570 --> 17:13.114
Okay, buddy boy, here it is.

17:13.490 --> 17:17.326
You hide my clothes.
I'm wearing everything you own.

17:17.869 --> 17:19.454
Oh, my God!

17:21.123 --> 17:24.791
That is so not the opposite
of taking somebody's underwear!

17:25.085 --> 17:26.627
Look at me! I'm Chandler.

17:26.837 --> 17:29.797
Could I be wearing any more clothes?

17:31.383 --> 17:33.676
Maybe if I wasn't going commando...

17:38.807 --> 17:41.100
It's hot with all this stuff on.

17:41.310 --> 17:43.895
I better not do any,
I don't know, lunges.

17:46.648 --> 17:48.983
Okay, enough.
Enough with the lunging.

17:49.234 --> 17:51.861
I'm sick of this.
I've had it up to here.

17:52.112 --> 17:54.614
Neither of you can come to the party!

17:55.115 --> 17:56.616
Jeez, what a baby!

17:57.659 --> 18:00.328
Way to ruin it.
I was just gonna go get dressed.

18:00.537 --> 18:02.997
The only person
I cared about getting dressed...

18:03.207 --> 18:05.666
...is the person who's
not even gonna go.

18:05.876 --> 18:07.752
Look, Rach, I'm sorry, okay?

18:08.003 --> 18:12.131
Look, I was a jerk, okay?
I'm sorry I yelled. I want you there.

18:12.341 --> 18:13.633
I need you there.

18:15.344 --> 18:19.222
What can I do to show you
how much I want you to be there?

18:20.432 --> 18:22.350
You could drink the fat.

18:24.895 --> 18:27.522
Welcome to an adult conversation.

18:27.940 --> 18:30.233
No, no, no.
Now wait a minute. Wait a minute.

18:30.526 --> 18:34.195
- That actually sounds interesting.
- What?

18:34.446 --> 18:36.572
I think you should drink the fat.

18:37.366 --> 18:38.407
Yay!

18:42.955 --> 18:46.958
Okay, if that's what it takes to
show you how much you mean to me...

18:47.209 --> 18:49.877
...and how much I want you there,
that's what I'll do.

18:50.087 --> 18:52.964
Let me get you another glass.
That's been sitting out.

18:53.715 --> 18:55.716
I think this will be fine.

18:56.969 --> 18:59.887
Okay, vanilla milkshake.
Just a vanilla milkshake...

19:00.180 --> 19:02.974
...with chicken bits floating in it.

19:06.228 --> 19:07.436
Cheers.

19:07.688 --> 19:10.314
No, don't! Okay, okay, I'll go.
I'll go.

19:10.566 --> 19:11.732
You will?

19:12.609 --> 19:14.569
You were really gonna do that?

19:14.778 --> 19:15.820
Well, yeah.

19:16.738 --> 19:18.906
You were gonna drink the fat.

19:22.452 --> 19:24.453
Let's see what else he'll do!

19:26.290 --> 19:29.125
How about you get changed?
Give him his underwear.

19:29.334 --> 19:32.628
I'll get a cab. I want everyone
downstairs in two minutes.

19:32.838 --> 19:33.963
Monica!

19:34.548 --> 19:35.590
Stop it.

19:35.757 --> 19:36.924
Stop it!

19:41.430 --> 19:43.097
Ross went to get a cab so we...

19:43.307 --> 19:45.933
What are you doing? No, Monica, no!

19:49.271 --> 19:50.730
Hi, this is Richard.

19:52.608 --> 19:55.109
You have three new messages.

19:56.153 --> 19:57.737
Not anymore.

19:58.447 --> 19:59.947
Message erased.

20:02.159 --> 20:06.120
To record your message,
begin speaking at the tone.

20:07.623 --> 20:09.624
Hi, Richard. It's Monica.

20:09.875 --> 20:12.835
Listen, I did something
kind of crazy tonight.

20:13.045 --> 20:15.963
Maybe I'm getting my period
or something. I don't know.

20:16.632 --> 20:20.301
Anyway, I beeped into your machine
and I heard this message...

20:20.510 --> 20:21.969
...that freaked me out...

20:22.638 --> 20:25.306
...and Michelle will tell you the rest.

20:25.515 --> 20:30.269
I'm sorry, okay? And I hope that we
can just forget the whole thing.

20:33.190 --> 20:36.776
Your outgoing
message has now been changed.

20:37.903 --> 20:38.903
Outgoing?

20:39.071 --> 20:40.363
Did that say outgoing?

20:40.572 --> 20:41.989
Not outgoing!

20:45.160 --> 20:47.078
Hi, Richard, it's Monica.

20:47.329 --> 20:50.289
Listen, I did something
kind of crazy tonight.

20:50.499 --> 20:53.167
Maybe I'm getting my period
or something. I don't know.

20:53.377 --> 20:55.836
- How did you do that?
- I don't know!

20:56.088 --> 20:58.172
- Goodbye.
- No!

20:59.883 --> 21:00.925
Okay.

21:01.093 --> 21:05.388
Okay, I've got two cabs
and no people! Go, go, go!

21:05.597 --> 21:08.849
Maybe we can call the phone company
to change the message?

21:09.101 --> 21:10.393
They could change his number.

21:10.602 --> 21:13.729
I think after this,
he'll be doing that himself.

21:15.691 --> 21:16.732
Rachel!

21:20.570 --> 21:21.612
Wow!

21:22.572 --> 21:25.199
You...
You look...

21:25.701 --> 21:26.867
Wow!

21:27.703 --> 21:30.871
And I still have about
five seconds to spare.

21:36.962 --> 21:38.587
That was about 7 seconds.

21:38.839 --> 21:40.423
So we're a little late.

21:40.632 --> 21:42.425
Come on.

21:43.427 --> 21:45.261
Oh, and by the way...

21:45.554 --> 21:46.554
What?

21:46.930 --> 21:48.139
I'm going commando too.

21:59.651 --> 22:00.735
Dr. Geller?

22:01.028 --> 22:04.530
- Sherman Whitfield, London Institute.
- What a pleasure.

22:04.948 --> 22:09.618
I was quite impressed with your
paper on pre-Cretaceous fossils.

22:09.911 --> 22:12.121
Yes, it confirmed everything
I'd written.

22:12.414 --> 22:13.748
Excuse me.

22:13.999 --> 22:15.041
Hi.

22:15.584 --> 22:16.625
Yes?

22:16.918 --> 22:18.711
You're kind of sitting in my seat.

22:20.088 --> 22:21.714
What do you mean, your seat?

22:22.299 --> 22:25.217
- I mean, I was sitting there.
- But you got up.

22:25.427 --> 22:27.553
But I never left the room.

22:28.305 --> 22:30.639
But you left the chair area.

22:32.184 --> 22:35.019
All right, that's it.
Give me your underwear.
