Uh, Mom, are you going
to make any breakfast today?

01:20.801 --> 01:24.434
Nah, I'm not hungry.

01:24.434 --> 01:27.067
Well, maybe tomorrow.

01:30.501 --> 01:32.267
Hey, did anybody hear
any noises last night?

01:32.267 --> 01:34.901
Well, your father had gas.

01:38.567 --> 01:41.968
No. These were noises
I never heard before.

01:41.968 --> 01:43.267
Well, then
it could have been

01:43.267 --> 01:45.200
a girl
moaning your name.

01:47.567 --> 01:50.901
AL: Peg! We're out
of toilet paper!

01:52.801 --> 01:54.067
Daddy's up.

01:57.467 --> 02:00.434
Use some tissues.

02:00.434 --> 02:03.267
Where are
the tissues?

02:03.267 --> 02:07.934
On the top shelf
of the linen closet.

02:07.934 --> 02:09.300
I think.

02:09.300 --> 02:13.234
You need anything
while I'm up?

02:13.234 --> 02:16.234
Well, Daddy's going
to be in a mood.

02:16.234 --> 02:18.801
Just tell him
I went shopping.

02:18.801 --> 02:20.200
Could you get us some milk?

02:20.200 --> 02:21.734
[LAUGHS]

02:24.767 --> 02:27.567
Did you hear any
noises last night, Kel?

02:27.567 --> 02:28.868
I mean, for a while,

02:28.868 --> 02:30.801
I thought they were
coming from your room,

02:30.801 --> 02:33.400
but they weren't
the usual noises.

02:33.400 --> 02:35.534
You know, the whispers,

02:35.534 --> 02:38.100
"Quiet. You'll wake up
my parents."

02:38.100 --> 02:39.567
Then the muffled sound
of eight footsteps

02:39.567 --> 02:41.667
heading for the window.

02:41.667 --> 02:42.901
Then the sound
of loose change

02:42.901 --> 02:45.734
hitting the pillow.

02:45.734 --> 02:47.934
You know, Bud,

02:47.934 --> 02:50.868
with your good looks, I think
that you should be a model.

02:50.868 --> 02:54.100
I mean, I could see it now,
your little face on a poster

02:54.100 --> 02:55.300
with the caption,

02:55.300 --> 02:58.634
"My daddy didn't use a condom."

03:07.601 --> 03:10.267
You know, I had a horrible dream
last night.

03:10.267 --> 03:12.934
There was this big mosquito

03:12.934 --> 03:17.901
with a huge red head
and tight pants...

03:17.901 --> 03:19.267
Hovering over me,

03:19.267 --> 03:22.200
sucking money
from my wallet.

03:24.334 --> 03:26.801
Then it wanted a kiss.

03:26.801 --> 03:29.434
By the way,
where is your mother?

03:29.434 --> 03:32.234
Uh, she went
shopping.

03:32.234 --> 03:34.667
The garage or basement?

03:34.667 --> 03:36.801
Basement.

03:36.801 --> 03:38.234
Did you hear any noises
last night?

03:38.234 --> 03:41.100
It might have been me sobbing,
son.

03:41.767 --> 03:43.334
Aah!

03:43.334 --> 03:44.834
Aah!

03:44.834 --> 03:47.434
Oh! Oh! Aah!

03:47.434 --> 03:49.434
Aw, jeez. What?

03:49.434 --> 03:51.834
Oh, Al, it was horrible.
It was terrible.

03:51.834 --> 03:53.734
I've never been so scared
in my entire life.

03:53.734 --> 03:56.567
What's the matter?
You see the vacuum?

03:59.467 --> 04:00.501
No.

04:00.501 --> 04:02.400
Al, it was a mouse.

04:02.400 --> 04:04.934
Oh, great. This was all
our life was missing.

04:04.934 --> 04:06.033
Kill it, Al.

04:06.033 --> 04:07.033
Well, don't worry.

04:07.033 --> 04:08.634
As soon as it sees
how we live,

04:08.634 --> 04:10.701
it'll go away.

04:10.701 --> 04:13.000
I know I would.

04:13.000 --> 04:15.033
No, Al, you've got
to kill it.

04:15.033 --> 04:16.601
It was so
disgusting.

04:16.601 --> 04:17.634
Oh, hold me.

04:17.634 --> 04:19.733
Oh, why?

04:19.733 --> 04:21.534
I didn't do
anything wrong.

04:23.167 --> 04:26.934
Why are you so afraid
of a little mouse, anyway?

04:26.934 --> 04:31.167
Well, it all started
when I was five.

04:31.167 --> 04:32.701
You see,

04:32.701 --> 04:35.934
I found this little stray
Chihuahua puppy in the yard.

04:35.934 --> 04:39.234
I snuck it past mother
and I kept it in my room.

04:39.234 --> 04:42.701
I slept with it and snuggled it
and kissed it,

04:42.701 --> 04:44.434
and then one day, it got sick.

04:46.067 --> 04:48.300
And still, you go on
kissing others.

04:53.033 --> 04:56.067
Anyway, I took it
to my kindergarten teacher,

04:56.067 --> 04:58.634
and I said,
"What's wrong with my dog?"

04:58.634 --> 05:00.701
She said,
"That's not a dog, dear.

05:00.701 --> 05:02.033
It's a mouse."

05:04.434 --> 05:06.400
And then she threw up.

05:06.400 --> 05:09.834
And then all the kids
threw up.

05:09.834 --> 05:12.501
And then, they made up
this little song about me.

05:12.501 --> 05:14.501
* Mouse in your face
Worms in your hair *

05:14.501 --> 05:16.033
* Where's the little
Mouse girl? *

05:16.033 --> 05:18.367
* There, there, there **

[SNORTING]

05:25.868 --> 05:28.934
Well, that's sweet.
Thank you very much.

05:28.934 --> 05:31.767
Well, kids, I think we
learned something today.

05:31.767 --> 05:33.767
Don't touch your mother.
She has cooties.

05:40.567 --> 05:42.968
Al, call an exterminator.

05:42.968 --> 05:47.234
Great. $50 for someone
to kill some stupid mouse?

05:47.234 --> 05:48.634
I'll take care of it after work.

05:48.634 --> 05:50.334
I don't know
what the big deal is.

05:50.334 --> 05:52.601
I mean, what harm
can one little mouse do?

06:02.000 --> 06:03.200
Well, that takes care
of that.

06:03.200 --> 06:04.234
The traps are set.

06:04.234 --> 06:07.100
That mouse has seconds to live.

06:07.100 --> 06:12.000
So as usual, it proves
that Daddy's life is dirt,

06:12.000 --> 06:13.834
and, uh, he's defeated
the enemy.

06:15.133 --> 06:16.968
Don't be too sure, Dad.

06:16.968 --> 06:18.200
It says right here

06:18.200 --> 06:19.200
that mice
are pretty intelligent.

06:19.200 --> 06:20.868
Yeah, right.

06:20.868 --> 06:24.234
Look, Bud, a mouse has a brain
about this big.

06:24.234 --> 06:27.367
Mine's at least
twice that size.

06:29.167 --> 06:31.367
Yeah, but if you
only use it half as much,

06:31.367 --> 06:33.501
it becomes
a fair fight again.

06:34.767 --> 06:37.167
Dad, you cannot be serious.

06:37.167 --> 06:39.167
A mousetrap in my room?

06:39.167 --> 06:42.501
The guys under the bed
object, Kel?

06:42.501 --> 06:44.000
Dad, it's a humiliation.

06:44.000 --> 06:45.834
I mean, what are my friends
going to think

06:45.834 --> 06:47.934
when they come over and see
mousetraps all over the place?

06:47.934 --> 06:50.267
Well, they'll think that,
unlike Mr. Bundy,

06:50.267 --> 06:52.934
the mouse gets to eat
before he dies.

06:52.934 --> 06:55.868
Mom, how long are we going
to have to live with this mouse?

06:55.868 --> 06:58.400
Well, your father's
taking care of it.

06:58.400 --> 07:01.400
Oh, great. Might as well
build him a room.

07:01.400 --> 07:03.067
Does anybody but me
think it's strange

07:03.067 --> 07:06.400
that with the three of you here,
it's the mouse I'm after?

07:06.400 --> 07:08.601
Ah, look. I'm going bowling.

07:08.601 --> 07:10.100
Oh, no, you're not.

07:10.100 --> 07:12.601
You are not leaving
this family alone

07:12.601 --> 07:15.801
until either you
or that mouse is dead.

07:15.801 --> 07:18.300
Wow, what a horse race.

[MOUSETRAP SNAPS]

07:22.234 --> 07:24.234
He's done.

07:29.634 --> 07:31.167
What?

07:31.167 --> 07:33.667
Why doesn't somebody
check the trap?

07:33.667 --> 07:36.767
Well, I can't.
It's just too disgusting.

07:36.767 --> 07:38.000
Oh, come on.

07:38.000 --> 07:39.968
You used to sleep
with one.

07:43.067 --> 07:45.067
Well, I sleep
with you too,

07:45.067 --> 07:47.000
but you don't see me
cleaning up after you,

07:47.000 --> 07:48.033
do you?

07:48.033 --> 07:49.367
This is great.

"Daddy, I need food."

07:52.834 --> 07:55.000
to clean up a mouse
with a broken neck."

07:55.000 --> 07:57.501
Just once
I'd like to hear,

07:57.501 --> 07:59.567
"Al, I'm out of here
and I'm taking the kids."

08:03.501 --> 08:07.501
But on the good side,
life is half over.

08:09.634 --> 08:12.467
Kids, I am sorry
to make such a big fuss

08:12.467 --> 08:14.133
over such a little thing
like a mouse,

08:14.133 --> 08:15.400
but you know,

08:15.400 --> 08:16.834
there are just some things
from childhood

08:16.834 --> 08:18.334
you just can't forget.

08:18.334 --> 08:20.868
I hope that
isn't true, Mom.

08:22.033 --> 08:23.934
Now, how about
a hug?

08:23.934 --> 08:25.701
Can't, Mom.
You've got cooties.

08:31.734 --> 08:33.467
Is he down there?
Did you get him?

08:33.467 --> 08:34.833
What happened, Al?

08:34.833 --> 08:38.801
He doodied on the trap.

08:38.801 --> 08:41.567
And in my bowling shoes.

08:41.567 --> 08:43.067
Oh, my God.

08:43.067 --> 08:46.934
He was in your shoes
and he lived?

08:49.234 --> 08:52.367
This is no ordinary mouse.

08:52.367 --> 08:54.367
Can we call
the exterminator now?

08:54.367 --> 08:56.000
No, no. It's personal now.

09:01.400 --> 09:03.400
Not only
will I kill this mouse,

09:03.400 --> 09:04.901
I'll torture it.

09:04.901 --> 09:07.501
I'll smack him around.

09:07.501 --> 09:10.000
I'll throw it against the wall,

09:10.000 --> 09:12.300
and if
there's one spark of life left

09:12.300 --> 09:14.434
in its twitching little body,

09:14.434 --> 09:16.667
I'll strap it to a chair,
tape its eyelids open,

09:16.667 --> 09:18.834
and make it watch
 <i>Thirtysomething.</i>

09:25.601 --> 09:28.801

in Al Bundy's shoes

09:28.801 --> 09:30.334
and lives!

09:47.601 --> 09:49.267
I'm worried
about Daddy.

09:49.267 --> 09:51.934
Shh!

09:51.934 --> 09:54.467
Mom, even if the mouse
is stupid enough

09:54.467 --> 09:56.467
to stick his head out
for the cheese,

09:56.467 --> 09:59.467
won't Dad smash his hand
with the hammer?

09:59.467 --> 10:00.968
Yes, Bud, he will.

10:00.968 --> 10:04.934
But you know, everyone
who watches Roadrunner cartoons

10:04.934 --> 10:07.000
knows the coyote is going
over the cliff,

10:07.000 --> 10:10.400
but you watch it
and laugh anyway.

Aah!

10:31.033 --> 10:34.767
I can hear him
laughing, Peg.

10:34.767 --> 10:37.167
He thinks
he's got me.

10:37.167 --> 10:38.367
No, Al.

10:38.367 --> 10:41.400
He's laughing because
he knows I've got you.

10:42.868 --> 10:44.901
Well, you know
I have no insurance,

10:44.901 --> 10:47.834
so you must be killing me
for the sport.

10:47.834 --> 10:49.000
Honey, believe me.

10:49.000 --> 10:51.067
Don't you think I wish
you could do things

10:51.067 --> 10:55.701
like kill a mouse,
make love, earn a living?

10:55.701 --> 10:58.067
But, sweetheart, you can't.

10:58.067 --> 11:01.467
Now, I've learned to live
with poverty and frustration,

11:01.467 --> 11:04.601
but I just have to draw the line
when it comes to rodents.

11:04.601 --> 11:07.434
So please call
an exterminator.

11:07.434 --> 11:10.234
Maybe, just maybe,
a professional can succeed

11:10.234 --> 11:12.767
where an idiot
has failed.

11:14.167 --> 11:15.434
Well, you'd love that,
wouldn't you?

11:15.434 --> 11:16.968
You get a pro in here,

11:16.968 --> 11:18.501
catch him
in a couple of seconds,

11:18.501 --> 11:19.968
and leave me standing here
looking stupid.

11:19.968 --> 11:21.400
Yeah, you and the mouse

11:21.400 --> 11:25.234
would really get a chuckle
out of that.

11:25.234 --> 11:26.667
Well, don't count on it,

11:26.667 --> 11:29.033
because I haven't played
all my cards yet.

11:29.033 --> 11:30.400
I went downstairs

11:30.400 --> 11:33.067
and I only pretended
to take up all the traps,

11:33.067 --> 11:36.734
but I left one, a big one,

11:36.734 --> 11:38.234
with a nice juicy piece
of cheese,

11:38.234 --> 11:40.467
and this one won't go off
with just a little pressure,

11:40.467 --> 11:41.734
giving him
time to escape.

11:41.734 --> 11:44.667
No, this one takes
the entire body of a mouse

11:44.667 --> 11:45.868
to set it off.

11:45.868 --> 11:47.567
I checked it myself.

You know, that's what really
sets you apart, Al.

12:16.834 --> 12:19.734
But you're just
not smart enough.

12:19.734 --> 12:23.200
Now, please,

12:23.200 --> 12:25.000
No one has to know.

12:25.000 --> 12:26.133
You know,

12:26.133 --> 12:28.434
we could tell everybody
that you caught it.

12:28.434 --> 12:29.734
How would that be?

12:32.067 --> 12:33.601

12:33.601 --> 12:35.567
He's chewing.
Al, he's always chewing.

12:35.567 --> 12:37.667
Now, what do you say?

12:37.667 --> 12:39.934
BUD: Dad!

12:39.934 --> 12:41.801
Dad, the mouse chewed
through the wires.

12:43.934 --> 12:45.601
What do I say, Peg?

12:45.601 --> 12:47.234
I say stand back,

12:47.234 --> 12:49.834
because I'm kicking
some mouse ass!

13:05.667 --> 13:09.367
And $75 for the vet.

13:09.367 --> 13:10.901
Oh, and then
there's the electrician.

13:10.901 --> 13:12.234
They're really
expensive.

13:12.234 --> 13:14.667
That's another $200.

13:14.667 --> 13:16.033
That comes to...

13:16.033 --> 13:20.534
$680 in damages from one mouse.

13:20.534 --> 13:22.901
I'm sorry, Peggy.

13:22.901 --> 13:25.267
Why can't men ever
utter the words,

13:25.267 --> 13:27.033
"I don't know how"?

13:27.033 --> 13:31.934
Even on our honeymoon,
Al just would not admit it.

13:31.934 --> 13:34.234
I really thought Steve
would be able to talk Al

13:34.234 --> 13:36.367
into getting an exterminator.

13:36.367 --> 13:41.501
But, just like a man, he says,
"We can do it ourselves."

his goldfish is dead.

Good. Mine?

the basement.

14:56.868 --> 14:58.400

14:58.400 --> 15:01.400
Steve came up behind me.
I thought he was the mouse.

15:02.868 --> 15:05.334
I shot
from the hip.

15:05.334 --> 15:06.601
I'll tell you this.

15:06.601 --> 15:08.434
If that mouse had been
where Steve's face was,

15:08.434 --> 15:10.000
he'd be one dead mouse.

15:10.000 --> 15:12.267
Did we get him?

15:12.267 --> 15:13.567
No, buddy,

15:13.567 --> 15:15.334
but we took out
the water heater.

15:16.934 --> 15:20.901
Steve? Pumpkin?

15:20.901 --> 15:22.801
Who's speaking?

15:22.801 --> 15:25.367
It's Marcie, Steve.

15:25.367 --> 15:28.868
Maybe now you'll tell Al
to hire a professional.

15:28.868 --> 15:31.133
That's just
like you, Marcie.

15:31.133 --> 15:32.701
It's like when
we're out driving,

15:32.701 --> 15:35.200
and I know
where I'm going,

15:35.200 --> 15:37.000
and you keep saying,
"Ask someone."

15:37.000 --> 15:40.133
It is so irritating.

15:40.133 --> 15:41.634
By the way, Marcie,

15:41.634 --> 15:44.501
I inhaled a great quantity
of poison.

15:44.501 --> 15:46.501
Don't worry about it, Steve.

15:46.501 --> 15:47.634
It wasn't for nothing.

15:47.634 --> 15:49.634
We may not have got him
with a direct hit,

15:49.634 --> 15:50.634
but I'll tell you this.

15:50.634 --> 15:51.868
He'll be dropping soon,

15:51.868 --> 15:53.434

Saddle up, Steve.
We're going back in.

16:07.634 --> 16:10.334
Forget it, Al.

16:10.334 --> 16:14.267
Now, you know it, we know it,

16:14.267 --> 16:15.834
Well, if he didn't have
toxic poisoning,

16:15.834 --> 16:17.667
he'd know it too.

16:17.667 --> 16:20.234
Now, I am calling
an exterminator.

16:20.234 --> 16:21.667
Don't call an exterminator!

16:21.667 --> 16:23.467
Why not?

16:23.467 --> 16:25.334
Because we melted
the phone line

It's because no matter
how big the guy was

I remember one football game.

17:45.000 --> 17:46.567
We were up against this team

17:46.567 --> 17:49.067
that had the biggest linebacker
in the city.

17:49.067 --> 17:51.701
He was like
a building with teeth.

17:51.701 --> 17:54.033
I tried finessing him,
faking him,

17:54.033 --> 17:56.300
but he was always there.

17:56.300 --> 17:59.000
He was real good,
real, real cocky.

17:59.000 --> 18:01.000
I don't like cocky guys.

18:01.000 --> 18:02.467
Anyhow, towards the end
of the game,

18:02.467 --> 18:04.334
I decided that I was going
to try something

18:04.334 --> 18:07.100
that no one else tried before
with this guy.

18:07.100 --> 18:09.167
I was going to run right at him.

18:09.167 --> 18:10.434
I ran right over him

18:10.434 --> 18:12.834
like a bus
over an ice cream cone.

18:15.133 --> 18:16.968
It was the only touchdown
we scored that day,

18:16.968 --> 18:20.067
