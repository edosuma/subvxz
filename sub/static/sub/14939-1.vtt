Manager to the front.

00:19.306 --> 00:21.573
This is Cameron.

00:21.641 --> 00:23.009
Hello?

00:31.668 --> 00:34.187
I'm looking for ice cream.

00:34.254 --> 00:35.593
Uh, ice cream.

00:35.631 --> 00:37.575
Um, end of the aisle.

00:37.695 --> 00:39.077
It's time to kill.

00:40.530 --> 00:42.107
Excuse me?

00:59.454 --> 01:01.756
Hey. You free
on Saturday, Hicks?

01:01.823 --> 01:03.724
You want to take a shift
for Hector?

01:03.792 --> 01:05.191
Yeah, sure.

01:05.260 --> 01:06.847
Time to kill, Hicks?

01:06.967 --> 01:08.199
Pull the trigger.

01:13.034 --> 01:14.301
Kill.

01:14.369 --> 01:18.404
Pull the trigger...

01:18.472 --> 01:19.639
- Time to...
- Kill.

01:19.706 --> 01:22.308
Hey, it's time.

01:26.613 --> 01:27.914
Yeah, man, a real
rasta thing, you know.

01:28.302 --> 01:30.470
Pull the trigger.

01:38.492 --> 01:39.592
It's time to kill.

01:39.660 --> 01:41.161
Pull the trigger.

01:41.228 --> 01:43.729
It's time to kill.

01:43.797 --> 01:45.364
Pull the trigger.

01:45.432 --> 01:46.632
Time to kill, Hicks?

01:46.700 --> 01:47.597
It's time to kill.

01:47.717 --> 01:49.156
Pull the trigger.

01:49.703 --> 01:50.736
It's time to kill.

01:50.804 --> 01:51.771
Pull the trigger.

02:44.857 --> 02:46.057
Pull the trigger.

He's inside.

03:12.650 --> 03:13.684
Hello, Don.

03:13.752 --> 03:16.153
Just come right in, please.

03:16.221 --> 03:18.256
You eatin' grass again?

03:18.323 --> 03:20.991
Oh, that's Asian pennywort.

03:21.058 --> 03:23.159
It increases the blood flow
and oxygen to the brain.

03:23.227 --> 03:24.259
It's a quite a eye-opener.

03:24.379 --> 03:25.795
Want a bite?

03:25.863 --> 03:27.764
I don't eat shrubs.
For you.

03:35.672 --> 03:38.375
Well, this seems, uh, sticky.

03:38.442 --> 03:39.776
No kidding.

03:39.843 --> 03:41.711
People are asking questions
to which answers are scarce.

03:41.779 --> 03:43.579
Well, I understand,

03:43.647 --> 03:44.881
- but my group--
- Has deniability, Rosen.

03:44.949 --> 03:46.716
It doesn't technically exist.

03:46.784 --> 03:49.719
So you do this for me
and don't bust my balls.

03:49.787 --> 03:51.221
So refreshingly candid, Don.

03:53.856 --> 03:56.125
What the hell
are you wearing?

03:58.995 --> 04:01.563
I try to swim
two miles each day.

04:01.631 --> 04:03.065
Look, this is important.

04:03.133 --> 04:04.166
Lives are at stake.

04:04.234 --> 04:05.935
Um...

04:06.002 --> 04:08.070
That's not exact coffee.

04:08.138 --> 04:10.472
It's a kind of ayurvedic
roasted barley grain.

04:10.540 --> 04:13.409
You're welcome to it,
but, uh...

04:13.476 --> 04:14.776
Right away, Lee.

04:14.844 --> 04:16.745
And get a new doorbell.

04:37.666 --> 04:39.334
Sign right here, ma'am.

04:39.401 --> 04:42.636
You're lucky I didn't take you
in for reckless driving.

04:42.704 --> 04:45.539
and I really
appreciate it.

04:45.607 --> 04:47.842
Can you do me a favor and...

04:47.909 --> 04:50.211
take your glasses off?

04:52.681 --> 04:56.716
Take this ticket and eat it.

05:02.690 --> 05:04.257
There you go.

05:04.325 --> 05:05.692
The carbon, too.

05:09.530 --> 05:13.733
Are you single or...

05:13.801 --> 05:17.037
Have a nice day, officer.

05:27.780 --> 05:29.148
I spoke to Donna.

05:29.216 --> 05:30.216
Have you seen my keys?

05:30.283 --> 05:31.917
Uh, check
the front cupboard.

05:31.985 --> 05:34.253
She and Jerry want us to
come to the shore this weekend.

05:34.321 --> 05:35.721
Yeah, but they're
not over there.

05:35.788 --> 05:37.289
They say they've been trying
to get in touch with you.

05:37.357 --> 05:38.557
I know.

05:38.625 --> 05:40.426
Um, they're not here.

05:40.494 --> 05:42.661
It's just gonna be
more awkward after the hearing

05:42.729 --> 05:44.063
when you're
back on the job.

05:44.131 --> 05:46.265
I know.
Please, can you focus with me?

05:46.333 --> 05:47.433
- Help me find my keys.
- Phil. Phil?

05:47.501 --> 05:49.668
Stop. Just stop.

05:49.736 --> 05:51.270
Eye contact.

05:52.705 --> 05:55.607
Deep breath.

05:55.675 --> 05:57.809
Have you checked
your other jacket?

05:57.877 --> 05:59.578
I checked my jacket.

05:59.646 --> 06:00.879
Your other jacket.

06:03.416 --> 06:04.816
Right.

06:08.487 --> 06:10.622
What do you know?
This is why I married you.

06:13.426 --> 06:15.393
You okay?

06:15.461 --> 06:18.030
I love you.

06:18.097 --> 06:19.898
I feel sorry
for you, woman.

06:21.701 --> 06:23.635
Hey, hey.

06:23.703 --> 06:25.136
Thank you.

06:25.204 --> 06:26.404
Love you.

06:26.472 --> 06:28.005
You, too.
Say hi to Dr. Rosen.

07:16.621 --> 07:19.155
You got a problem?

07:32.969 --> 07:34.670
- Hey, Sam.
- Rachel, where's your mother?

07:34.738 --> 07:36.672
She'll be down in a second.

07:36.740 --> 07:38.608
Sam, can you hem this for me,
just an inch, please?

07:38.675 --> 07:39.675
Any shorter,
it's a miniskirt.

07:39.743 --> 07:41.544
It still covers
my knees, papa.

07:41.612 --> 07:43.513
Don't start.
And don't wait up, okay?

07:43.580 --> 07:44.813
I gonna be working late
again, okay?

07:44.881 --> 07:45.881
- Again?
- Again.

07:45.949 --> 07:47.983
What else is new?

07:48.051 --> 07:49.018
Don't worry.

07:49.085 --> 07:50.520
Be careful.

07:50.587 --> 07:52.155
She's 24?

07:52.222 --> 07:53.623
Breaking her mother's heart.

07:53.690 --> 07:57.493
Where is your daughter
at this point, two sons?

07:57.561 --> 07:58.827
Three sons.

08:01.497 --> 08:02.631
Three sons.

08:05.801 --> 08:07.335
I don't even think
she's looking for a husband.

08:07.403 --> 08:09.171
Not that she'd get one

08:09.238 --> 08:10.539
with her condition.

08:29.792 --> 08:31.193
You almost ready, Gary?

08:38.567 --> 08:41.034
Gary?

08:41.102 --> 08:43.437
You want your cereal,
the other one?

08:51.747 --> 08:55.249
Here, you like this one.

08:56.318 --> 08:58.452
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

08:58.520 --> 09:01.488
Omega three.

09:01.556 --> 09:03.256
Omega.

09:03.290 --> 09:04.591
Two fluid ounces.

09:04.658 --> 09:06.392
Mmm.

09:07.394 --> 09:09.196
Mmm...

09:16.537 --> 09:18.705
Gary,
stop watching the TV...

09:18.773 --> 09:19.740
Or whatever.

09:19.807 --> 09:21.041
Ha!

09:21.109 --> 09:23.243
Poof. It disappeared.

09:28.116 --> 09:29.750
They're almost here.

09:42.062 --> 09:43.296
- Hey.
- Good morning.

09:43.364 --> 09:44.330
- Hey, Gary.
- Hey.

09:44.398 --> 09:45.732
Hey, cool jacket.

09:45.799 --> 09:47.300
- It's new.
- Yeah.

09:47.368 --> 09:48.534
Touch it.

09:48.602 --> 09:51.036
This is good
for him, Sandra.

09:51.104 --> 09:53.439
Human interaction
and normal activity.

09:53.507 --> 09:55.241
It's all good.

09:55.309 --> 09:57.042
Now you're just trying
to make me feel better.

09:57.110 --> 09:58.043
Well, you should
feel better.

09:58.111 --> 09:59.245
You deserve to.

09:59.313 --> 10:01.046
Well, at least I can
get to the salon now.

10:01.114 --> 10:02.615
Really hates that place.

10:02.683 --> 10:04.116
- I can drive.
- No, he can't.

10:04.184 --> 10:05.951
He can't drive.

10:06.019 --> 10:07.185
You know, I think
your hair looks lovely

10:07.253 --> 10:08.587
just the way it is.

10:08.655 --> 10:10.221
Thank you.

10:10.290 --> 10:11.490
Have a good day.

10:11.557 --> 10:12.491
- Bye.
- Bye.

10:12.558 --> 10:13.692
Bye.

10:26.038 --> 10:27.439
Thanks, Gary.

10:37.016 --> 10:38.716
U should have made
this coffee stronger.

10:38.784 --> 10:40.384
Well, you could make it
yourself next time.

10:40.452 --> 10:42.186
I'm putting
my lunch in the refrigerator.

10:42.253 --> 10:43.387
- Hi, Gary.
- Okay.

10:43.455 --> 10:44.689
Good morning.

10:44.756 --> 10:45.723
My mother doesn't want me
to eat fast food,

10:45.791 --> 10:47.858
so I have to eat
what she makes me.

10:47.926 --> 10:49.427
You got it.

10:49.494 --> 10:50.661
And that's why
my name is on it.

10:50.729 --> 10:52.095
Don't eat what's
inside my bag.

10:52.163 --> 10:53.931
So what you're saying is
I can eat your sandwich, right?

10:53.998 --> 10:55.700
No, don't!
That's why my name is on it.

10:55.767 --> 10:57.335
I changed my name
to Gary, too.

10:57.402 --> 10:58.402
- Bill.
- I'm joking.

10:58.470 --> 10:59.537
It's a joke.

10:59.604 --> 11:01.104
Conference room,
two minutes, you guys.

11:01.172 --> 11:02.206
You're not funny.
You don't get it.

11:02.273 --> 11:03.273
You don't get it.

11:03.342 --> 11:04.375
I don't get it?

11:04.443 --> 11:06.276
If nobody laughs,
it's not funny.

11:08.346 --> 11:10.179
Good morning, Nina, Bill.

11:10.247 --> 11:11.514
Good morning, sir.

11:11.582 --> 11:13.282
Uh, my apologies for, uh,

11:13.351 --> 11:15.385
starting the morning
so abruptly,

11:15.453 --> 11:17.854
but, uh,
we have an urgent matter.

11:17.921 --> 11:19.989
Rachel, over here, please.

11:20.057 --> 11:24.026
Now, what we're
going to see is, uh,

11:24.094 --> 11:28.765
security footage from a camera
in interrogation room three

11:28.833 --> 11:30.066
at police headquarters
in Manhattan.

11:30.133 --> 11:31.167
You ready?

11:31.235 --> 11:32.662
Uh, yes.

11:33.637 --> 11:35.071
This information
you acquired,

11:35.138 --> 11:37.807
the encryptions
were considered unbreakable.

11:37.875 --> 11:40.809
Maybe it just came to me,
like the notes of a song.

11:40.877 --> 11:42.378
Now, watch this.

11:42.445 --> 11:44.546
This is where
it gets interesting.

11:44.614 --> 11:45.981
That's very funny.

11:46.048 --> 11:48.149
Uh, Mr. Keeler,
tell us more...

11:48.217 --> 11:49.585
Oh, I'm sorry.

11:49.652 --> 11:52.020
Oh, one moment.

11:52.088 --> 11:53.655
It must be this, uh...

11:53.723 --> 11:54.990
It's not the laptop.

11:55.057 --> 11:56.925
If I fix it,
I can get to drive the car.

11:56.993 --> 11:58.527
Uh, we'll see.

11:59.929 --> 12:01.764
You know what, Dr. Rosen,

12:01.831 --> 12:04.065
how about you just
explain it to us then?

12:04.133 --> 12:06.334
Of course. Um...

12:06.403 --> 12:09.772
NYPD brought in, uh, a suspect

12:09.839 --> 12:11.672
involved in blackmail,

12:11.740 --> 12:15.443
extortion, certain activities
that, uh, caught the attention

12:15.511 --> 12:18.112
of our generous patron,
Don Wilson.

12:18.179 --> 12:21.849
It just comes to me,
like the notes of a song.

12:21.917 --> 12:23.418
That's funny.

12:23.485 --> 12:25.486
Mr. Keeler,
could you, uh,

12:25.554 --> 12:27.847
tell us more about the method
you describe?

12:27.848 --> 12:29.611
I've already told you enough.

12:34.630 --> 12:37.532
The prisoner
was killed instantly.

12:37.599 --> 12:39.467
I don't see a gun.

12:39.535 --> 12:41.568
Oh, you fixed it,
wonderful.

12:41.636 --> 12:43.403
It was the VGA display port.

12:43.471 --> 12:45.071
Ah, thank you, Gary.

12:45.139 --> 12:46.940
So Wilson
was in the room, right?

12:47.007 --> 12:47.941
What's his take?

12:48.008 --> 12:49.676
He stumped.

12:49.744 --> 12:51.311
Uh, the room was sealed,

12:51.378 --> 12:54.314
a single door
and no windows,

12:54.381 --> 12:56.382
and no gun was found.

12:56.451 --> 12:58.485
So maybe someone
manipulated the footage.

12:58.553 --> 13:00.086
No, all tampering
was ruled out.

13:00.154 --> 13:01.321
No, this is a...

13:01.388 --> 13:04.791
This is a classic
locked room mystery.

13:04.859 --> 13:05.992
Hate those.

13:06.060 --> 13:07.761
So we need real eyes
on the scene, right?

13:07.829 --> 13:10.163
- So ideally a CSI unit or...
- Real eyes.

13:10.230 --> 13:13.098
A forensics team
from Quantico.

13:13.166 --> 13:16.068
Well, Wilson
wants it done quietly, so...

13:16.135 --> 13:17.302
So we're on our own again.

13:17.370 --> 13:18.604
Yeah.

13:18.672 --> 13:20.873
Uh, I appreciate
your patience, Bill.

13:20.941 --> 13:22.475
I'm on it.

13:22.542 --> 13:24.409
I fixed the TV,
Dr. Rosen.

13:24.478 --> 13:26.111
I fixed the TV.

13:26.179 --> 13:27.412
I'm the driver.

13:27.481 --> 13:29.047
Absolutely not.

13:40.627 --> 13:43.528
Shoot. Does anybody
have any change for the meter?

13:43.596 --> 13:45.262
- Change?
- Nina?

13:45.330 --> 13:47.098
Yeah, I don't carry change,

13:47.165 --> 13:48.867
but any of you
have a credit card?

13:48.934 --> 13:51.369
Yeah.
They take credit cards.

13:51.436 --> 13:53.170
Hey, guys, here,
take some change.

13:53.238 --> 13:54.305
I'm gonna see
what's going on.

13:54.373 --> 13:58.109
Nina, can you get
inside the room?

13:58.176 --> 14:00.177
Stupid question.

14:00.245 --> 14:01.312
I don't even think

14:01.380 --> 14:02.313
I'd know
how to walk in those.

14:02.381 --> 14:03.481
I got a closet
full of these.

14:03.549 --> 14:04.816
- I'll hook you up.
- Hook me up.

14:04.884 --> 14:06.618
You want
some, uh, stilettos, Gary?

14:06.685 --> 14:08.152
Yeah, hook me up.

14:08.220 --> 14:09.554
Do you mind
if we take a quick peek?

14:09.622 --> 14:11.656
Who are you with exactly?

14:11.690 --> 14:13.157
We can't--
we can't tell you,

14:13.191 --> 14:15.726
but we can do things that we're
not supposed to talk about...

14:15.793 --> 14:17.194
- Gary.
- That's why we can solve this.

14:17.262 --> 14:19.063
It's also why you need
to stop bugging us--

14:19.131 --> 14:20.197
Gary, that's enough.

14:20.265 --> 14:21.698
Have to let us do
what we need to do.

14:21.766 --> 14:23.600
- That's enough.
- Shh!

14:23.668 --> 14:24.968
Shouldn't be a problem.

14:25.037 --> 14:26.237
Excuse me?

14:26.304 --> 14:30.241
The problem is
all the water you drank.

14:30.308 --> 14:32.743
You have to go so badly,

14:32.810 --> 14:35.112
it must be hard
for you to stand there.

14:36.614 --> 14:38.815
You really have to go.

14:38.883 --> 14:39.917
I really gotta go.

14:39.984 --> 14:42.819
Take your time.

14:44.489 --> 14:46.489
You did it to her, didn't you?

14:46.557 --> 14:50.026
Dr. Rosen says that we're not
supposed to use our skills...

14:50.094 --> 14:51.928
- Hey, Gary, chill.
- Unless it's an emergency.

14:51.995 --> 14:53.329
Chill.

14:53.397 --> 14:55.865
We got five minutes,
tops.

14:55.933 --> 14:58.535
I'm just telling you
what Dr. Rosen said.

14:58.602 --> 15:03.406
Gary, please...
Just look for clues.

15:11.415 --> 15:13.249
Hey, what do ya got?

15:13.317 --> 15:15.618
She can't hear you.
She's doing a visual.

15:15.686 --> 15:17.852
All right,
so I got details on the slug.

15:17.920 --> 15:19.788
She can't hear you.
You don't need to whisper.

15:19.855 --> 15:21.423
Right.

15:21.491 --> 15:23.625
It's a .30 caliber.

15:23.693 --> 15:26.161
That's from a rifle.

15:28.298 --> 15:30.265
How does someone sneak
a rifle in a room like this?

15:30.333 --> 15:32.734
That's a good question.

15:38.841 --> 15:41.776
Does anybody know
where this vent goes?

15:46.583 --> 15:49.717
Well, this is very dramatic.

15:49.784 --> 15:53.421
Can't wait to hear what
you've got to tell me, hmm?

15:53.489 --> 15:56.090
Um, the shooter was here,
Dr. Rosen,

15:56.158 --> 15:58.926
facing east towards
police headquarters.

15:58.994 --> 16:01.362
Come here, I'll show you, here.

16:01.430 --> 16:02.563
Gary, over here.

16:02.631 --> 16:04.765
The shooter,
he lined up his shot,

16:04.833 --> 16:07.701
aiming at a vent on the western
face of the building.

16:10.071 --> 16:11.272
That's exactly what I said.

16:11.340 --> 16:12.773
She can read <i>The New York Times</i>

16:12.841 --> 16:15.443
from ten blocks away.
Let her roll.

16:15.511 --> 16:16.844
He fired a single bullet.

16:16.911 --> 16:18.246
The bullet entered the building

16:18.313 --> 16:20.413
at a 30-degree angle.

16:20.481 --> 16:22.750
It traveled through an air shaft

16:22.817 --> 16:24.752
and then collided
with an interior vent

16:24.819 --> 16:26.219
at the interrogation room

16:26.287 --> 16:28.088
and ricocheted
right into the victim.

16:28.156 --> 16:29.923
Oh, I'm sorry,
you forgot the part about

16:29.991 --> 16:32.159
the bird
that farted in New Jersey.

16:32.226 --> 16:34.194
I thought that that was funny.

16:34.262 --> 16:36.664
- That's funny, a bird fart.
- Someone has a sense of humor.

16:36.731 --> 16:37.765
Well, I like it.

16:37.832 --> 16:39.166
But is there any evidence

16:39.233 --> 16:42.269
to corroborate
this elegant hypothesis?

16:42.336 --> 16:44.805
Uh, what about this for evidence?

16:46.141 --> 16:50.877
Hey, whatever that is,
leave it alone.

16:50.944 --> 16:53.345
I'll be damned.

16:53.413 --> 16:58.117
It's a .30 caliber.

16:59.153 --> 17:00.687
Good work.

17:08.345 --> 17:10.970
The clinical term
for it is hyperkinesis.

17:11.094 --> 17:14.521
It's a rare condition, like
someone who has perfect pitch.

17:14.521 --> 17:17.299
Extraordinary balance,
perfect aim,

17:17.419 --> 17:20.402
and perfect synchrony
between thought and action.

17:20.470 --> 17:22.212
Like a Peyton Manning with a gun?

17:22.332 --> 17:25.848
Yes. Hyperkinetics
often show an impressive

17:25.968 --> 17:28.510
but sporadic
aptitude for sports.

17:28.578 --> 17:30.405
And not just riflery,
or hunting...

17:30.525 --> 17:32.251
Table tennis, figure skating?

17:32.371 --> 17:34.180
Bowling, archery,

17:34.430 --> 17:35.383
ping-pong.

17:35.503 --> 17:37.631
Oh! Ping-pong
is table tennis.

17:37.699 --> 17:40.501
Rachel, um, did you get
a peek at that bullet casing?

17:40.569 --> 17:41.835
Softball, volleyball,

17:41.903 --> 17:43.970
- football.
- Uh...

17:44.037 --> 17:47.140
There wasn't a print,

17:47.208 --> 17:49.442
but I'm gonna take a closer look.

17:49.510 --> 17:51.677
Football, British golf,
miniature golf.

17:51.745 --> 17:53.846
- Does he ever stop?
- Hey, you shut up.

17:53.914 --> 17:55.482
Gary,
what did we talk about?

17:55.549 --> 17:56.483
He started it.

17:56.550 --> 17:57.883
And how do we end it?

17:57.918 --> 18:01.087
I stop.

18:01.155 --> 18:03.923
So, um, basically,
we're looking for an athlete?

18:03.991 --> 18:07.026
Yes. And, relatedly, someone
who might have a predilection

18:07.094 --> 18:10.796
to over-stimulus,
uh, self-medication.

18:10.864 --> 18:11.797
Join the club.

18:11.865 --> 18:12.898
Possible addiction,

18:12.966 --> 18:14.600
even a criminal record.

18:14.667 --> 18:17.736
So we got a athlete,
drug addict, sniper,

18:17.803 --> 18:19.871
which means some
sort of military training.

18:19.939 --> 18:21.840
Starting to look
like real a criminal profile,

18:21.907 --> 18:23.142
which would mean

18:23.209 --> 18:26.545
this is almost like
a professional investigation.

18:26.613 --> 18:27.712
Whatever, Bill.

18:28.948 --> 18:30.682
- I'm gonna go--
- Whatever, Bill.

18:30.750 --> 18:32.351
Whatever, Bill.

18:32.418 --> 18:33.519
Okay.

18:33.586 --> 18:35.754
- Thank you.
- Okay.

18:35.821 --> 18:37.156
Gary?

18:38.891 --> 18:41.593
I have a bad attitude.

Japanese import,
<i>Children of the Revolution.</i>

20:05.342 --> 20:06.575
Hard to believe Marc Bolan

20:06.643 --> 20:08.310
started his career
in a skiffle band.

20:08.378 --> 20:10.979
What do you want?

20:11.047 --> 20:13.649
I want to know
what you've gotten us into.

20:13.717 --> 20:15.484
You know what you need to know.

20:15.552 --> 20:16.918
No, I'm afraid I don't,

20:16.986 --> 20:18.754
and I'm not gonna move forward
until I do.

20:18.821 --> 20:19.955
You jump when--

20:23.993 --> 20:25.593
So hostile.

20:25.661 --> 20:27.863
You weren't breast fed,
we're you?

20:27.930 --> 20:31.032
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Whatever you say.

20:31.100 --> 20:33.001
You think I'd put
these people in danger

20:33.069 --> 20:34.803
on your word alone, don?

20:34.871 --> 20:37.139
Think again.

20:37.206 --> 20:39.641
So some answers, please.

20:39.708 --> 20:42.710
Okay. Red Flag.

20:44.480 --> 20:46.782
The Alpha group?
The extremists?

20:46.849 --> 20:47.849
You call them extremists.

20:47.917 --> 20:49.349
I call them criminals,
terrorists.

20:49.417 --> 20:50.684
But I thought
we shut them down.

20:50.752 --> 20:51.846
Yeah, we did,
but they're back,

20:51.966 --> 20:53.537
and now they're expanding
from networking Alphas

20:53.657 --> 20:55.156
into human trafficking,
drugs...

20:55.223 --> 20:56.094
And murder.

20:56.214 --> 20:57.079
You saw the tape.

20:57.199 --> 20:59.860
Red Flag put a bullet
in our only witness.

20:59.928 --> 21:02.163
Now you know what I know.

21:02.230 --> 21:03.264
Can I, uh...

21:03.331 --> 21:04.364
Uh, scout's honor?

21:04.432 --> 21:06.733
On my mother's grave.

21:08.503 --> 21:10.938
How long has he been
back on active?

21:11.006 --> 21:12.940
Persky?
Couple a weeks, I think.

21:13.008 --> 21:15.042
Well, he looks fine to me.

21:15.110 --> 21:18.679
Two surgeries I heard.

21:18.746 --> 21:20.180
Do you mind?

21:20.247 --> 21:21.314
Do I mind what?

21:21.381 --> 21:22.715
Well, technically,

21:22.783 --> 21:24.818
I'm not supposed to share it
out of department.

21:24.885 --> 21:26.085
This is a joint op.

21:26.153 --> 21:28.521
I still do have my badge,
right?

21:28.588 --> 21:29.789
Not if it was up to Persky.

21:29.857 --> 21:31.291
Yeah, well, forget him.

21:31.358 --> 21:32.658
How many of these damn things
did you pull?

21:32.726 --> 21:35.061
You wanted vets with PTSD
and a list of priors.

21:35.129 --> 21:37.230
It's not a short list.

21:41.068 --> 21:42.401
What do you do, Bill?

21:42.469 --> 21:44.838
One week you come in,

21:44.905 --> 21:47.740
you ask for a file on a hundred-
year-old Russian chess master.

21:47.808 --> 21:49.976
Now it's military snipers
with a history of going nuts.

21:50.044 --> 21:51.177
What is it?

21:51.245 --> 21:54.480
I'm rehearsing
for <i>Jeopardy!</i>

22:07.093 --> 22:08.961
Any luck with those files?

22:09.028 --> 22:11.163
Oh, yeah.
Thank you.

22:11.231 --> 22:13.966
Don't forget
who hooked you up.

22:15.535 --> 22:18.136
Mmm.
This looks delicious.

22:18.204 --> 22:19.672
Mmm!

22:19.740 --> 22:21.039
This is really good.

22:21.107 --> 22:23.074
Thank you.

22:23.141 --> 22:24.175
Well...

22:24.243 --> 22:27.612
Rachel, where are we?
Anything yet?

22:27.680 --> 22:29.881
Um, well,

22:29.948 --> 22:31.249
we didn't actually
get a fingerprint

22:31.316 --> 22:32.584
off the bullet casing,

22:32.651 --> 22:36.053
but I did manage to pull
some biological residue.

22:36.121 --> 22:39.391
Um, traces of, uh, citrus rind,

22:39.458 --> 22:44.095
nicotine, pharmaceuticals, and...

22:44.162 --> 22:45.263
Um...

22:45.330 --> 22:47.031
Is there something
bothering you, Rachel?

22:47.099 --> 22:48.700
It's nothing.
It's nothing really.

22:48.768 --> 22:49.734
No? Oh.

22:49.802 --> 22:52.904
Well, indulge me, hmm?

22:52.971 --> 22:54.438
Please.

22:54.506 --> 22:56.840
It's Bill.

22:56.908 --> 22:58.174
He's--he's messy,

22:58.242 --> 22:59.843
and he's rude,
and he just--

22:59.911 --> 23:01.812
He takes things
without asking and--

23:01.880 --> 23:04.214
Yes, I--
No, I understand.

23:04.282 --> 23:06.049
Bill has
some boundary issues.

23:06.117 --> 23:08.719
- Some?
- Well, we're working on them.

23:08.787 --> 23:10.387
You know, the best thing
for him is, uh...

23:10.455 --> 23:12.956
And for you, is to confront him

23:13.024 --> 23:14.758
and tell him how you feel,

23:14.826 --> 23:16.059
what you need, and...

23:16.127 --> 23:18.529
No. I'm--just I--I'm...

23:18.596 --> 23:20.163
I can't. I'm sorry.

23:20.231 --> 23:21.832
- Yes, you can.
- No.

23:21.900 --> 23:23.300
You did just now
with me.

23:23.367 --> 23:26.803
That wasn't so difficult,
was it?

23:26.837 --> 23:29.204
Yes, it was--it was--

23:29.272 --> 23:31.240
- It wasn't so hard.
- Good, so you'll tell him.

23:31.308 --> 23:32.542
Now, you were saying,

23:32.609 --> 23:34.143
uh, residue, citrus rind
and nicotine.

23:34.210 --> 23:35.344
Oh, yes.

23:35.412 --> 23:37.914
An enzyme found only
in Caucasians

23:37.981 --> 23:39.315
of Northern European ancestry.

23:39.382 --> 23:41.651
So our assassin is, what,

23:41.718 --> 23:44.119
a jittery orange-eater
from Norway?

23:47.357 --> 23:49.191
Uh, anyway,

23:49.259 --> 23:51.527
that winnowed our search down
from 10,000

23:51.595 --> 23:53.162
to less than 300 suspects,

23:53.229 --> 23:56.030
which I then cross-referenced
with Harken's list from the FBI,

23:56.098 --> 23:58.166
and that left us
with 40 potential shooters.

23:58.233 --> 24:00.635
Gary's checking their names
for a match.

24:00.703 --> 24:02.136
That's...
That's great work.

24:02.204 --> 24:03.438
Thank you.

24:03.506 --> 24:05.139
That's gonna make our job
a whole lot easier.

24:05.207 --> 24:06.875
You guys need to see this.

24:06.943 --> 24:08.443
One more, son!

24:10.079 --> 24:12.981
Let's go.
Two more strikes!

24:13.048 --> 24:15.383
Strike him out!

24:15.451 --> 24:19.988
Yeah! Whoo!
That's two strikes!

24:24.794 --> 24:25.794
Oh, no.

24:25.862 --> 24:27.862
Come on, come on, come on!

24:27.929 --> 24:29.463
You got him, you got him!

24:33.768 --> 24:35.068
Come on, come on, come on!

24:35.136 --> 24:37.237
You got him, you got him!

24:43.745 --> 24:47.247
Yes, that's him.
That's Hicks, number seven.

24:47.315 --> 24:48.849
You sure
we got the right guy?

24:48.917 --> 24:50.317
Is that him?

24:50.385 --> 24:52.553
Absolutely.

24:52.621 --> 24:54.755
Cameron Hicks.

24:54.823 --> 24:57.424
He's the highest-rated marksman
in the history of the corps.

24:57.492 --> 24:59.492
Never fired a shot in combat,

24:59.560 --> 25:01.060
but his testing
is off the charts.

25:01.128 --> 25:03.029
Something's wrong here.

25:03.096 --> 25:05.398
A deadly assassin working
in a grocery store?

25:05.465 --> 25:07.000
Have a nice day.

25:07.067 --> 25:09.368
A hot deadly assassin,
but...

25:09.436 --> 25:10.637
Why would he?

25:10.704 --> 25:11.638
You're an
absolute mess, woman.

25:11.705 --> 25:12.872
- Have you no shame?
- What?

25:12.940 --> 25:14.273
I like the blue collar look.

25:14.341 --> 25:16.709
- I know you do.
- And the bad boy thing.

25:16.777 --> 25:18.277
I'm sure.

25:18.345 --> 25:21.648
- Please, you're just grumpy.
- No, I'm not.

25:21.715 --> 25:23.182
Yes, you're grumpy,
you should mellow.

25:23.250 --> 25:24.717
- You're hung over.
- You always drink.

25:24.785 --> 25:27.654
I had one beer
and two tequila shots.

25:27.721 --> 25:29.755
Which is like breakfast
for me.

25:29.822 --> 25:32.123
You drank beer for breakfast?

25:32.158 --> 25:33.725
I like cereal.

25:33.793 --> 25:36.194
I have a special mixture.

25:36.262 --> 25:39.031
Hey, Hicks.

25:39.098 --> 25:40.532
What are you doing here?

25:40.600 --> 25:42.467
You walked out
in the middle of last shift.

25:42.535 --> 25:44.636
You never came back,
you never called.

25:44.704 --> 25:47.505
Uh, no, I, uh...

25:47.574 --> 25:49.541
Look, I just, um...

25:49.609 --> 25:51.743
- I stepped out for a minute.
- Are you on drugs, my man?

25:51.811 --> 25:52.911
No.

25:52.979 --> 25:54.613
I'm sorry.
Company policy.

25:54.681 --> 25:55.981
Oh, come on, look,
you don't have to do this.

25:56.049 --> 25:58.516
I got no choice.

26:01.820 --> 26:03.788
Here he comes.

26:03.855 --> 26:06.657
There. There he is.

26:08.526 --> 26:09.894
He's walking south.

26:09.962 --> 26:11.228
Okay, Gar.

26:11.296 --> 26:14.498
He--his apartment is
five blocks south from here.

26:14.566 --> 26:15.633
No, his apartment.

26:15.701 --> 26:17.134
- Rachel's at his apartment.
- Yes!

26:17.202 --> 26:18.803
- I told her, in and out.
- She needed a little longer.

26:18.870 --> 26:20.771
Guys, in the field,
when I give you orders,

26:20.839 --> 26:22.339
you take them.
They're my orders.

26:22.407 --> 26:23.407
Rachel, out now.

26:23.475 --> 26:25.109
Rachel, copy. Get out.

26:25.176 --> 26:28.445
Rachel, out of there now.
Rachel.

26:28.513 --> 26:29.814
Rachel!

26:31.215 --> 26:32.215
- She's not listening.
- Copy.

26:32.282 --> 26:33.516
What about her cell phone?

26:33.584 --> 26:35.719
- Rachel!
- She's not listening.

26:35.786 --> 26:37.053
Amateur hour!

27:14.958 --> 27:16.191
There he is.

27:22.198 --> 27:23.899
Keep trying her.
I'm going in.

27:23.967 --> 27:24.967
I'm on it.

27:47.756 --> 27:51.292
Hey, you guys,
I found something.

27:52.327 --> 27:53.294
Get out of there.

27:53.361 --> 27:54.495
- What?
- Rachel, he's coming!

27:54.563 --> 27:55.697
- Get out of there!
- Hey!

27:55.764 --> 27:57.699
What the hell
are you doing?

27:57.766 --> 27:59.200
Whoa!
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

27:59.267 --> 28:00.234
- FBI!
- Hold it!

28:00.302 --> 28:02.603
On...the ground now!

28:02.671 --> 28:04.571
- Okay, okay!
- Now!

28:21.956 --> 28:23.456
Yeah, come here!
Come here!

28:32.800 --> 28:35.067
What the hell'd
you do to my car?

28:36.870 --> 28:38.638
Careful, Gar, okay?

28:42.376 --> 28:44.910
You've been going
for five minutes.

28:45.011 --> 28:46.912
You're spiking, okay?

28:46.980 --> 28:49.482
Rachel, what do you hear?

28:52.386 --> 28:54.820
He's--he's running, uh,
past a cafe,

28:54.888 --> 28:56.889
and--and there's
a street musician in front.

28:56.957 --> 28:58.491
Uh, there's
a street musician.

28:58.559 --> 28:59.992
Okay Gary,
help us out.

29:00.060 --> 29:01.193
Just left the park,

29:01.261 --> 29:03.129
heading into an alley
three blocks north.

29:03.196 --> 29:05.631
Okay, I'm on it.

29:05.698 --> 29:07.532
No, you need to stay.
You need to stay put.

29:12.305 --> 29:15.074
- Cameron, just stop.
- Who are you?

29:15.142 --> 29:16.275
Wait.
I'm not gonna hurt you.

29:16.342 --> 29:17.276
Why are you chasing me?

29:17.343 --> 29:19.311
Why are you running?

29:21.181 --> 29:23.149
I don't know...

29:23.216 --> 29:24.416
It's okay.

29:24.484 --> 29:25.417
Just calm down.

29:25.485 --> 29:27.953
There you go.

29:28.021 --> 29:29.621
You must be tired.

29:29.689 --> 29:31.056
Exhausted, right?

29:31.124 --> 29:32.357
Yeah.

29:32.425 --> 29:33.825
A little weak?

29:33.893 --> 29:36.627
Just go to sleep.

29:36.695 --> 29:38.930
Everything will be all right.

29:38.998 --> 29:42.366
Just go to sleep.

30:00.488 --> 30:02.589
Just relax, Mr. Hicks.

30:02.657 --> 30:04.791
Whoa, whoa, Dr. Rosen...

30:04.858 --> 30:07.060
What is this?

30:09.497 --> 30:11.208
A lesion.

30:11.328 --> 30:14.133
It's not more
than a week old.

30:17.004 --> 30:20.273
- Prepare 50 CCs.
- Okay.

30:20.341 --> 30:23.756
He shouldn't be here, Nina.
That is my point.

30:23.876 --> 30:25.036
Something's off.

30:25.156 --> 30:27.347
Of course something's off.
I whip out my cuffs,

30:27.415 --> 30:29.207
the perp ends up in FBI
or police custody.

30:29.327 --> 30:31.718
No, I mean, he had no idea
why we were following him.

30:31.785 --> 30:32.852
He's guilty, okay?

30:32.920 --> 30:34.287
He reminds me
of the people I pushed.

30:34.355 --> 30:36.422
He seemed confused,
disoriented.

30:36.489 --> 30:38.124
Yeah, it's called
being a crackhead, okay?

30:38.192 --> 30:39.358
It's not as simple
as all that.

30:39.426 --> 30:40.993
Crystal meth
maybe where you're from.

30:41.061 --> 30:42.428
- Bill!
- I don't know, drug addicts?

30:42.495 --> 30:43.763
Excuse me, excuse me.

30:43.831 --> 30:45.564
Nina, confused--
What do you mean?

30:45.632 --> 30:47.533
I don't think he
knew what he was doing.

30:47.601 --> 30:48.968
You don't think he knew
what he was doing?

30:49.036 --> 30:50.402
Bill, controlling the will
of another mind

30:50.470 --> 30:51.637
is not a new trick.

30:51.705 --> 30:53.639
Hypnotists, charismatics,
religious leaders--

30:53.707 --> 30:54.941
all of them manipulate

30:55.008 --> 30:56.442
the neural structure
of the brain

30:56.509 --> 30:58.044
to get their desired results,

30:58.112 --> 31:00.079
not to mention
our very own Nina here.

31:00.147 --> 31:03.116
Now, normally it starts
in the frontal lobe.

31:03.183 --> 31:04.450
Nina's "pushing,"
for example,

31:04.517 --> 31:06.219
causes a microseizure
in this region.

31:06.286 --> 31:08.610
It's a temporary effect,
which fades in minutes.

31:08.730 --> 31:10.845
Not on me.
It doesn't work on me.

31:10.978 --> 31:12.111
You're right, Gary,

31:12.179 --> 31:13.580
because the success
of Nina's pushing

31:13.648 --> 31:15.615
is dependent on the plasticity
of the subject brain,

31:15.683 --> 31:17.250
so it's
not always effective.

31:17.318 --> 31:18.452
What does this have to do--

31:18.519 --> 31:19.986
What does this
have to do with the shooter?

31:20.054 --> 31:21.387
This is the shooter's brain.

31:21.456 --> 31:24.758
And here we have
a mass of abnormal size.

31:24.826 --> 31:26.660
My guess is that
the induction in this case

31:26.727 --> 31:28.795
is long-lasting
and far more substantial.

31:28.863 --> 31:31.030
Right, so...

31:31.098 --> 31:33.467
What the hell
does this mean?

31:33.534 --> 31:35.535
That's
a very good question, Bill.

31:38.005 --> 31:38.972
Don?

31:39.039 --> 31:41.140
Another donut shop.

31:41.208 --> 31:42.741
Yeah, since they've opened,

31:42.809 --> 31:44.810
I've had to add
another 20 laps to my swim.

31:44.878 --> 31:46.712
You know, half these places
are just a front.

31:46.780 --> 31:48.247
We need to talk
about the shooter.

31:48.315 --> 31:49.582
One on every corner.

31:49.649 --> 31:51.184
More donuts than
could possibly be consumed.

31:51.251 --> 31:52.751
You know 40%
of all small businesses

31:52.819 --> 31:54.153
are owned by foreign nationals?

31:54.221 --> 31:55.955
You know
that's simply not true.

31:56.023 --> 31:57.723
Well, it could be.
We don't know.

31:57.791 --> 31:59.692
Tell me about the shooter.

31:59.759 --> 32:03.162
He was brainwashed.

32:03.230 --> 32:04.897
Why would you say
something like that?

32:04.965 --> 32:07.400
Because it's true.

32:07.468 --> 32:09.068
I ran an MRI.

32:09.136 --> 32:10.302
He has an abnormal growth.

32:10.370 --> 32:12.637
This isn't good.

32:12.705 --> 32:14.973
Don, my team is at risk.

32:15.041 --> 32:16.475
You ever heard
of the ghost files?

32:16.542 --> 32:18.310
No, don't answer.
Of course not.

32:18.378 --> 32:20.512
- What ghost files?
- I never asked you that.

32:20.579 --> 32:21.813
No, I'm asking you.

32:21.881 --> 32:23.382
- What?
- What?

32:23.449 --> 32:25.283
Why do I feel
I'm in a Beckett play

32:25.351 --> 32:26.551
when I talk to you?

32:26.619 --> 32:28.153
I don't know
who that is, okay?

32:28.221 --> 32:30.688
The murders: a patsy,

32:30.756 --> 32:32.324
innocent man on the street,

32:32.392 --> 32:34.192
a perpetrator we know
next to nothing about,

32:34.260 --> 32:35.727
but people end up dead.

32:35.794 --> 32:37.929
Lovely.

32:37.997 --> 32:40.298
A man we sent in to infiltrate
Red Flag last year

32:40.366 --> 32:42.033
died when a taxi
swerved into him,

32:42.100 --> 32:43.067
killing them both.

32:43.135 --> 32:44.868
Another one of our informants?

32:44.936 --> 32:46.404
Gutted by his cleaning lady,

32:46.471 --> 32:47.671
who then slit
her own throat.

32:47.739 --> 32:50.107
The only evidence linking
these two killings?

32:50.175 --> 32:51.842
A bump in the brain.

32:51.910 --> 32:54.412
"Not good" is
a bit of an understatement.

32:54.479 --> 32:56.013
Well, I'm sure
you can handle it.

32:56.081 --> 32:57.114
I mean,
you're always telling me

32:57.182 --> 32:58.582
how special
your people are, Rosen.

32:58.650 --> 33:01.652
Yes, and you could have
told me about this before.

33:01.719 --> 33:03.521
"I swear on my mother's grave"?

33:03.588 --> 33:05.789
She was cremated.

33:07.292 --> 33:11.295
Go get the ghost
before he gets someone else.

34:15.623 --> 34:17.492
You're late.
Four minutes.

34:17.559 --> 34:18.792
I got held up.

34:22.297 --> 34:24.364
I couldn't get a positive I.D.
on any of them.

34:24.433 --> 34:26.434
Checked federal records,
other sources.

34:26.502 --> 34:28.034
Even DMV.

34:28.103 --> 34:29.337
There's nothing there.

34:29.404 --> 34:30.938
They've been scrubbed.

34:36.344 --> 34:38.012
This will do.

34:38.079 --> 34:39.447
I have one more thing
to pass on.

34:39.514 --> 34:40.614
Our superiors are worried,

34:40.681 --> 34:41.782
and they want to
accelerate the schedule.

34:41.850 --> 34:43.684
I told them I work
on my own schedule.

34:43.752 --> 34:46.520
I've planned this out
with extreme precision.

34:46.587 --> 34:49.289
Your arrival today has thrown
everything off.

34:49.357 --> 34:51.123
It was just four minutes.

34:51.192 --> 34:52.324
I'll tell you what,

34:52.393 --> 34:53.659
it won't happen again.

34:53.726 --> 34:55.928
No, it won't.

34:57.965 --> 35:03.170
This time, you will follow
my instructions exactly.

35:06.207 --> 35:09.809
Follow the light, please.

35:09.877 --> 35:11.244
And back.

35:12.547 --> 35:13.680
Thank you.

35:14.882 --> 35:15.848
Who are you?

35:15.916 --> 35:17.383
I am a doctor.

35:17.450 --> 35:20.186
My name is Lee Rosen.

35:20.253 --> 35:22.754
Can you tell me
what day it is?

35:22.822 --> 35:24.223
I'm not
telling you anything.

35:24.291 --> 35:26.091
Look, this obviously
isn't a hospital,

35:26.159 --> 35:29.261
so who exactly
are you people?

35:29.329 --> 35:31.263
What's this?

35:31.331 --> 35:32.731
You can trust me,
Mr. Hicks.

35:32.799 --> 35:34.099
I'm trying to help you.

35:34.167 --> 35:38.904
I'm giving you
an injection of topirimate.

35:38.971 --> 35:43.175
It interrupts messages
from your basal ganglia,

35:43.243 --> 35:47.579
countering any effects
of forced induction.

35:49.415 --> 35:52.883
Yeah, but I am more interested
in your blackouts.

35:52.951 --> 35:56.821
You left work
in the middle of the day?

35:56.888 --> 35:58.456
How do you know about that?

35:58.524 --> 36:00.991
What was the last thing
you remember?

36:04.296 --> 36:06.397
Please, Mr. Hicks,
this is very important.

36:06.465 --> 36:09.434
What was the last thing you
remember before you blacked out?

36:09.501 --> 36:10.868
My, uh...

36:10.936 --> 36:12.903
My phone rang,

36:12.971 --> 36:15.740
and, I don't know,
there was a sound,

36:15.807 --> 36:18.408
like a tone or something.

36:18.476 --> 36:19.443
And then?

36:19.510 --> 36:21.044
And then, uh...

36:21.112 --> 36:23.012
And then I don't know.

36:23.080 --> 36:25.315
I guess
it was the next day.

36:25.383 --> 36:26.950
And anything else?

36:27.017 --> 36:28.918
Say, for example, aphasia?

36:28.986 --> 36:30.120
Excuse me?

36:30.187 --> 36:32.656
Difficulty reading,
hearing wrong words.

36:35.760 --> 36:38.061
How could
you possibly know that?

36:38.129 --> 36:41.030
Mr. Hicks, please,
in your own words,

36:41.098 --> 36:43.400
tell me
what you experienced.

36:44.636 --> 36:48.639
I, uh...
I couldn't--

36:48.706 --> 36:53.476
I couldn't understand
what anyone was saying.

36:53.543 --> 36:55.544
All the words,
even the ones on the billboards,

36:55.612 --> 36:56.812
they just kept
saying the same thing...

36:56.880 --> 36:57.813
Time to kill, Hicks?

36:57.881 --> 36:59.782
Over and over again.

36:59.849 --> 37:01.584
Time to kill. Time to kill.

37:01.652 --> 37:03.152
Look, what's wrong with me?

37:03.219 --> 37:04.654
- Uh, nothing.
- Nothing?

37:04.721 --> 37:07.990
If nothing's wrong with me,
why am I locked up?

37:08.057 --> 37:10.159
You killed a man,
Mr. Hicks.

37:27.743 --> 37:28.843
Kill yourself.

37:34.550 --> 37:37.251
Hey, what are you doin'?

37:37.320 --> 37:38.486
You don't think
that stuff, man.

37:38.554 --> 37:39.521
No, no, stop, stop.

37:39.588 --> 37:40.622
That stuff's gonna kill ya!

37:40.690 --> 37:42.390
W-what are you doin'?

37:42.425 --> 37:44.125
You can't drink
that stuff! Stop!

37:57.121 --> 37:58.407
So you're saying
that I was brainwashed?

37:58.527 --> 38:00.490
Yes, uh...

38:00.559 --> 38:02.760
The aphasia is incidental.

38:02.827 --> 38:06.163
It's a mere side effect
of the location of the lesion.

38:08.104 --> 38:10.901
Look, assuming
I actually believe you,

38:10.969 --> 38:13.037
why would someone do this to me?

38:13.104 --> 38:15.105
Because you are an Alpha.

38:15.173 --> 38:17.774
I'm a what?

38:17.841 --> 38:21.343
You have
a, uh, neurological difference

38:21.411 --> 38:24.346
that confers
some exceptional advantage.

38:24.414 --> 38:26.449
But you are not alone.

38:26.516 --> 38:29.251
Everyone on this unit
is just like you, Cameron.

38:29.319 --> 38:30.587
They are all Alphas.

38:30.654 --> 38:32.622
No, I'm...
I'm not an Alpha.

38:32.690 --> 38:36.559
Well, disregard the term
for the time being.

38:36.627 --> 38:37.994
Surely you have wondered

38:38.062 --> 38:41.130
where your incredible gifts
come from?

38:41.198 --> 38:43.900
Is it normal to pitch
two perfect games in a row?

38:43.968 --> 38:45.234
Yeah, and not throw
another strike

38:45.302 --> 38:47.136
until they boot my ass
down to double-a ball?

38:47.204 --> 38:48.236
No, it's not normal, doc,

38:48.304 --> 38:49.671
but it sure as hell
isn't a gift.

38:49.739 --> 38:54.142
Well, your hyperkinesis,
it's a delicate instrument,

38:54.210 --> 38:56.011
and when it falls
out of tune,

38:56.079 --> 38:58.313
it crashes.

38:58.380 --> 39:00.749
All Alpha skills
come with a downside, Cameron.

39:00.817 --> 39:02.618
I'm sorry, okay?

39:02.685 --> 39:04.552
- This whole thing is just...
- It's hard to believe.

39:04.621 --> 39:06.021
Yeah, a little bit.

39:06.089 --> 39:07.555
Would you do me a favor

39:07.624 --> 39:09.891
and buy me a soda?

39:12.061 --> 39:13.161
Seriously?

39:13.229 --> 39:14.395
Yes, here.

39:14.463 --> 39:15.463
Please.

39:17.500 --> 39:19.433
But, uh, do it, uh...

39:19.501 --> 39:21.902
Do it from here, hmm?

39:21.970 --> 39:23.537
Come on.

39:23.605 --> 39:25.572
Look, I'm a good shot,
but that's impossible.

39:25.641 --> 39:26.941
Well, try.

39:33.515 --> 39:34.682
Okay?

39:34.750 --> 39:36.383
Again.

39:41.023 --> 39:42.790
Look, this is stupid.

39:42.858 --> 39:47.327
Our minds are capable
of so much more than you think.

39:49.197 --> 39:50.396
Again.

39:53.768 --> 39:55.769
No.

39:55.836 --> 39:58.371
No.

40:01.241 --> 40:03.276
You focus on the moments

40:03.343 --> 40:07.213
when your remarkable skill
fails you,

40:07.281 --> 40:10.116
but the potential is there
clearly.

40:14.055 --> 40:16.222
What do you want from me?

40:16.290 --> 40:17.623
You didn't send your team
out to hunt me down

40:17.692 --> 40:20.259
just to, uh, give me
this little therapy session.

40:20.327 --> 40:23.295
You have barely
scratched the surface

40:23.362 --> 40:24.997
of what you are capable of.

40:28.802 --> 40:33.505
Okay. So, if this "Ghost"
is actually involved,

40:33.573 --> 40:34.840
how do you track him?

40:34.908 --> 40:37.409
Well, all his
former proxies are dead.

40:37.476 --> 40:40.445
Mr. Hicks would not be alive
if his work were complete,

40:40.513 --> 40:43.148
if this ghost was not planning
on using him again.

40:43.216 --> 40:45.383
So I answer the phone,
then what?

40:45.451 --> 40:48.020
Oh, you just go out there
and kill someone else.

40:48.088 --> 40:49.154
Bill, please.

40:49.222 --> 40:50.655
Sounds like
a really good plan to me.

40:50.724 --> 40:52.190
To answer your question,
Mr. Hicks,

40:52.257 --> 40:53.825
Gary is our transducer,

40:53.892 --> 40:57.061
which means that he can read
a wide range of frequencies,

40:57.129 --> 41:00.531
including television, Wi-Fi,
and cell phone transmissions...

41:00.599 --> 41:01.999
Except for Nokia.

41:02.067 --> 41:03.334
It's a different protocol.

41:03.401 --> 41:05.336
So when the call comes in,

41:05.403 --> 41:07.338
Gary will trace the signal
back to its source.

41:07.405 --> 41:09.306
By scanning
local antenna towers,

41:09.374 --> 41:10.975
I can create a splash grid.

41:11.043 --> 41:12.676
Oh. I'm the Cold Charlie.

41:12.745 --> 41:13.778
What?

41:13.846 --> 41:16.447
It's a way
of flushing out snipers.

41:16.514 --> 41:18.282
You put your helmet on the end
of your rifle,

41:18.350 --> 41:19.316
stick it out there.

41:19.384 --> 41:21.352
Sniper takes a shot.

41:21.419 --> 41:23.386
You clock his position,
you nail him.

41:23.454 --> 41:25.222
The helmet on the end
of the rifle,

41:25.289 --> 41:26.723
that's the Cold Charlie,

41:26.791 --> 41:28.125
and that's me, right?

41:28.192 --> 41:29.559
He catches on quick.

41:29.627 --> 41:31.962
Well, I don't see
that we have much choice.

41:32.029 --> 41:34.697
You are aware, Mr. Hicks,

41:34.766 --> 41:36.399
that if the Gost
is still out there,

41:36.467 --> 41:38.902
you are very much at risk.

41:40.504 --> 41:41.872
All right.

41:43.141 --> 41:45.375
Gary, you got
a lock on his cell?

41:45.442 --> 41:46.576
Yes, I do.

41:46.644 --> 41:49.412
I'm not gonna argue
this point.

41:49.480 --> 41:51.714
It's a process issue, Lee.
Okay?

41:51.783 --> 41:53.816
We're moving into
a whole new line of work here.

41:53.884 --> 41:55.851
You can't hire amateurs
for this type of deal.

41:55.919 --> 41:57.920
I understand
your frustration, Bill.

41:57.988 --> 42:00.322
They can't carry firearms,
the equipment is--

42:00.390 --> 42:02.091
Needs improvement, yes.

42:02.159 --> 42:03.793
I'm actually jotting
this down as we speak.

42:03.860 --> 42:04.860
It's, uh...

42:04.928 --> 42:06.162
You know, it's very constructive.

42:06.229 --> 42:07.729
"Constructive"?

42:07.798 --> 42:09.198
Yes, I hear your concerns,

42:09.266 --> 42:10.933
and I will address them.

42:11.001 --> 42:13.035
You know what? You're
using that shrink voice again.

42:13.103 --> 42:14.703
What voice is that?

42:14.771 --> 42:16.705
If you keep doing that,
I'm gonna hang up on you.

42:16.773 --> 42:18.373
Are you anxious
about is operation,

42:18.441 --> 42:20.009
or is it something else...

42:28.217 --> 42:29.384
Water okay?

42:29.452 --> 42:32.788
Sorry. It's, uh,
the strongest thing I got.

42:32.855 --> 42:35.590
That's a cute kid.

42:35.658 --> 42:37.192
Is that the ex?

42:37.259 --> 42:39.294
Yeah. It's Patti,

42:39.362 --> 42:41.029
back when she used
to put up with my crap.

42:41.096 --> 42:43.565
Comes with the territory.

42:43.633 --> 42:45.567
Yeah,
Rosen gave me that speech.

42:45.635 --> 42:47.936
Of course,
the whole "downside" speech.

42:48.003 --> 42:50.004
You spent more
than five minutes with him,

42:50.072 --> 42:51.272
so why wouldn't he?

42:51.341 --> 42:52.774
Yeah?

42:52.842 --> 42:54.876
So, uh, what's yours?

42:54.944 --> 42:56.811
What's my what?

42:56.878 --> 42:59.046
What, no, uh...
no downside for you?

42:59.113 --> 43:00.548
Well, I don't count toothpicks
or cut myself,

43:00.615 --> 43:01.949
if that's
what you're getting at.

43:02.016 --> 43:03.150
No, but, um...

43:03.218 --> 43:05.586
I live rent-free
in a penthouse in Soho.

43:05.654 --> 43:07.455
I do what I want,
take what I need,

43:07.522 --> 43:09.490
don't answer to anyone.

43:11.159 --> 43:12.493
Except Rosen.

43:12.561 --> 43:13.994
Yeah, I work for Rosen.

43:14.062 --> 43:15.162
Yeah,
so you answer to him.

43:15.230 --> 43:17.030
It's a job.

43:17.098 --> 43:18.632
Right, just, uh...

43:18.700 --> 43:20.267
Just punching
the clock, huh?

43:20.335 --> 43:24.104
Look, if there's
something you want to know,

43:24.172 --> 43:25.673
you just ask.

43:25.741 --> 43:28.475
Look, I'm just saying.

43:28.542 --> 43:30.076
Most people,
if they could do what you do...

43:30.143 --> 43:31.411
Would what?

43:31.479 --> 43:32.779
But not you.

43:32.847 --> 43:36.349
You work with Rosen,
you're here helping me out.

43:36.417 --> 43:39.085
Maybe I'm just
a really nice person.

43:40.788 --> 43:43.155
I don't know.

43:43.223 --> 43:44.624
Are you?

43:44.692 --> 43:46.459
No.

43:51.295 --> 43:53.248
What do I do?

43:53.368 --> 43:57.370
Answer it.

44:00.573 --> 44:03.174
Hello?

44:12.296 --> 44:14.663
Okay, so what do I do?

44:14.731 --> 44:16.273
Give him the topirimate.

44:16.393 --> 44:17.921
You sure this'll work?

44:18.200 --> 44:20.707
Well, conceivably,
one could also stimulate

44:20.945 --> 44:24.146
a primal emotional response
to overwhelm the programming.

44:24.214 --> 44:25.482
Okay, whoa, whoa, whoa.

44:25.549 --> 44:27.851
Just, uh, back up,
what?

44:27.918 --> 44:29.018
Just give him the shot.

44:29.086 --> 44:30.419
Okay.

44:43.566 --> 44:45.033
Okay, you're fine.

44:45.101 --> 44:48.637
Uh, Gary?
Any luck with the signal?

44:49.939 --> 44:51.139
I got it.

44:54.577 --> 44:56.211
I'll get in the back.

45:16.665 --> 45:18.766
- How are we doing?
- Gary's trackin' it.

45:18.834 --> 45:20.268
We're close.

45:20.336 --> 45:22.570
It's there.

45:22.638 --> 45:24.672
This is it.
It's here.

45:24.740 --> 45:27.008
It's this.

45:27.076 --> 45:28.910
Coming from the sixth floor.

45:28.977 --> 45:30.211
- You're sure?
- Yes.

45:30.279 --> 45:32.047
Okay, we've got
a Midtown hotel location.

45:32.114 --> 45:34.049
I'm gonna put the team in place,
then move in.

45:34.116 --> 45:35.049
Copy that?

45:35.116 --> 45:36.883
I-I'll be right there.

45:36.951 --> 45:38.652
- Nina, with me.
- Yeah.

45:38.719 --> 45:40.054
Rachel, I need you
to stay here

45:40.121 --> 45:41.755
and make sure the car
does not get towed.

45:41.822 --> 45:42.989
Okay.

45:43.058 --> 45:44.558
Gary, I need you
to keep feeding me intel.

45:44.625 --> 45:46.026
I need to know
if he moves an inch.

45:46.094 --> 45:47.027
Yes, intel.

45:47.095 --> 45:48.595
How can I help?

45:48.663 --> 45:50.264
You can help by not
killing anyone today.

45:50.331 --> 45:52.933
The guy brainwashed me.
Harken, I can help.

45:53.000 --> 45:54.401
You can take these off
when it's over.

45:54.469 --> 45:55.569
Rachel.
Let's go, Nina.

45:59.441 --> 46:01.275
I'm going up to six.

46:01.342 --> 46:02.842
Let me know when
you get a room number.

46:08.749 --> 46:09.982
Can you hear me?

46:10.050 --> 46:11.217
Uh-huh.

46:11.285 --> 46:13.752
Yes. Signal isn't moving.

46:17.324 --> 46:19.959
I need a list of your current
guests on the sixth floor?

46:21.628 --> 46:23.696
Uh, I don't know
what that is,

46:23.763 --> 46:25.698
and I'm gonna need
a search warrant.

46:25.765 --> 46:26.966
Right.

46:29.035 --> 46:30.236
Oh.

46:32.106 --> 46:36.809
Look, here's my search warrant

46:36.876 --> 46:38.578
right...here.

46:38.645 --> 46:41.581
Here...Here...

46:45.852 --> 46:47.653
This is a search warrant.

46:49.222 --> 46:50.255
Yeah.

46:50.323 --> 46:51.556
Let me get
that information for you.

46:56.462 --> 46:58.530
I need a room number,
Nina.

46:58.598 --> 47:00.565
Yeah,
I'm workin' on it Bill.

47:05.538 --> 47:08.140
Single guests, been here
for longer than a week.

47:08.207 --> 47:10.042
Okay, I'm trying.
Just give me one second.

47:18.483 --> 47:20.584
I got a bellhop here.

47:20.653 --> 47:22.620
I'm almost there, Bill.

47:22.688 --> 47:23.988
Just keep
your panties on.

47:25.090 --> 47:28.459
Nina,
I need the number.

47:32.097 --> 47:33.297
Okay, room 613.

47:33.365 --> 47:36.500
Room 613.
Room 613.

47:36.568 --> 47:38.469
That's the room
the bellman just went in.

47:41.406 --> 47:43.274
I'm goin' in.

47:52.116 --> 47:53.717
Come on, Rachel, look,
he's gonna need some help.

47:53.785 --> 47:55.618
You gotta let me out.
Please.

47:55.687 --> 47:58.188
I can't.

48:35.659 --> 48:36.859
Get down!

48:41.164 --> 48:42.532
I lost him!

48:42.600 --> 48:44.367
West stairwell.

48:44.435 --> 48:46.836
Rachel, come on,
he's getting away!

48:47.938 --> 48:49.205
All right.

48:50.573 --> 48:53.775
Get your guys
to block all these exits.

48:53.843 --> 48:55.410
Don't let anyone through.

48:55.478 --> 48:58.012
Excuse me, what?

48:58.080 --> 49:00.349
Tell your guys
to block these exits.

49:00.416 --> 49:02.183
Come on, get these exits blocked.

49:02.252 --> 49:03.585
- Yeah, I need this, too.
- Okay.

49:10.326 --> 49:11.660
Hicks!

49:11.728 --> 49:12.761
- I'm on him!
- Hicks!

49:14.997 --> 49:16.365
Hey!

49:16.432 --> 49:17.766
Come on, come on,
come on.

49:22.604 --> 49:24.071
Hicks?

49:28.477 --> 49:30.611
I got him!

49:32.847 --> 49:35.048
All right, get up.

49:35.116 --> 49:36.216
Nice and easy.

49:36.285 --> 49:38.452
Nice and easy.

49:52.566 --> 49:55.234
Down, get down,
get down!

49:55.303 --> 49:56.936
- Ohh!
- Stop!

49:57.004 --> 49:58.070
I got him!

50:05.579 --> 50:06.613
Stop!

50:06.681 --> 50:07.681
No!

50:21.160 --> 50:24.196
Oh, my God,
he just jumped.

50:24.263 --> 50:25.864
All right, copy that.

50:25.932 --> 50:27.933
What happened?

50:28.000 --> 50:29.335
Where am I?

50:29.402 --> 50:31.537
It's over.
You okay?

50:31.604 --> 50:33.205
Yeah.

50:33.272 --> 50:34.740
Thanks.

50:39.524 --> 50:41.592
Yeah, any available
for traffic control in Midtown,

50:41.660 --> 50:43.326
gimme a 20.

50:45.763 --> 50:47.230
Has the victim
been IDed yet?

50:47.298 --> 50:50.366
When we have more information,
we'll let you know, ma'am.

50:55.685 --> 50:57.785
I don't know.
It doesn't make sense to me.

50:57.853 --> 51:00.021
Why would he would jump?

51:00.089 --> 51:02.457
You okay?

51:02.525 --> 51:03.725
Yeah, just...

51:03.792 --> 51:05.594
Bad memories.

51:05.661 --> 51:06.661
Right.

51:09.699 --> 51:10.632
Mm.

51:10.700 --> 51:11.866
Oh, look.

51:11.934 --> 51:13.400
Look, here's
the angle of the shot,

51:13.468 --> 51:14.735
just as you said.

51:14.802 --> 51:16.903
Every single moment
was planned.

51:16.971 --> 51:18.472
Yeah. Well, I've
has several patients

51:18.540 --> 51:22.343
who have exhibited this kind of
obsessive-compulsive behavior.

51:22.410 --> 51:25.946
I would like
to take this with us.

51:26.981 --> 51:28.482
Gray suits.

51:28.550 --> 51:30.751
Gray suit, dark coat.

51:33.255 --> 51:34.588
Look at this.

51:34.656 --> 51:38.091
Strange that someone with
such a compulsive methodology

51:38.159 --> 51:39.727
would deviate from it.

51:39.794 --> 51:41.595
Using Hicks a second time.

51:41.663 --> 51:44.498
Yes.

51:44.566 --> 51:48.100
Whoever he was after must have
been extremely important.

51:52.906 --> 51:53.873
You okay?

51:53.940 --> 51:55.941
I'll be fine.
Thanks.

51:56.009 --> 51:57.042
You did good.

51:57.110 --> 51:59.412
No, I made a mess
f this thing.

51:59.480 --> 52:02.548
I should have
kept it more contained.

52:02.616 --> 52:06.686
Yeah, I guess in that case,
you blew it.

52:06.754 --> 52:08.554
We're heading back to the office.

52:08.622 --> 52:10.956
Rosen wants me to stay
and spin the story,

52:11.024 --> 52:12.258
so you guys go ahead.

52:12.326 --> 52:13.526
Leaving the part
about the alphas

52:13.594 --> 52:14.527
and the brainwashing out?

52:14.595 --> 52:16.162
Good luck with that.

52:16.229 --> 52:17.663
Tell me about it.

52:19.632 --> 52:21.132
Did a good job, Hicks.

52:21.200 --> 52:22.901
Thanks.

52:22.968 --> 52:27.606
Nina, I need both of you
in the van, okay?

52:27.674 --> 52:28.707
Sure.

52:30.376 --> 52:31.576
I was just trying
to make sure

52:31.644 --> 52:32.911
no one got hurt, and--

52:32.978 --> 52:37.649
Oh, I understand, Bill.
Thank you.

52:37.717 --> 52:39.984
I have no idea
what you're asking me,

52:40.052 --> 52:41.219
but I don't know.

52:41.287 --> 52:43.254
Okay?
What are you lookin' at?

52:43.323 --> 52:47.458
It would've been nice
to get some scans.

52:47.526 --> 52:48.659
You think so?

52:48.727 --> 52:50.194
It also would be nice
if I didn't have

52:50.261 --> 52:51.362
every department in the city

52:51.430 --> 52:53.364
asking for explanations
I can't give.

52:53.432 --> 52:55.232
Are you upset, Don?

52:55.300 --> 52:56.834
Home team
won this one, didn't it?

52:56.901 --> 52:58.302
I can have
two conflicting emotions

52:58.370 --> 52:59.537
at the same time, Rosen.

52:59.604 --> 53:00.971
I'm complicated that way.

53:01.039 --> 53:03.273
And don't think I've forgotten
about your shooter.

53:03.342 --> 53:04.642
I know
how your mind works.

53:04.710 --> 53:06.076
You do?

53:06.144 --> 53:08.011
We're coming for him.

53:08.079 --> 53:10.247
Uh, we should talk
about that.

53:10.315 --> 53:11.582
We just did.

53:11.650 --> 53:14.117
Uh, Don, he...

53:14.185 --> 53:16.119
He was a big help to us,

53:16.187 --> 53:17.421
and I think I can help him.

53:17.489 --> 53:19.522
I don't care. Go.

53:41.612 --> 53:45.147
Something still
does not make sense.

53:45.215 --> 53:50.152
The Ghost chose proxies who were
consistently average.

53:50.220 --> 53:51.453
Housekeeper,
taxicab driver,

53:51.521 --> 53:52.521
man on the street.

53:52.589 --> 53:55.358
But this time,
he chooses an Alpha.

53:55.425 --> 53:57.593
Hicks is the only one
who makes that shot.

53:57.660 --> 53:59.228
Yes,
and that's just it.

53:59.296 --> 54:00.763
This plan is so complex

54:00.830 --> 54:03.900
and was executed perfectly.

54:03.967 --> 54:06.235
It was bound to draw
some attention.

54:06.303 --> 54:07.336
Maybe he got sloppy.

54:07.404 --> 54:09.471
No.

54:09.539 --> 54:12.775
No, that is very unlikely.

54:12.842 --> 54:14.944
So what happens to Hicks?

54:15.012 --> 54:17.380
Wilson sends him
to the compound?

54:19.316 --> 54:20.482
Oh, I don't think so.

54:20.550 --> 54:22.717
He's not a prisoner.

54:22.785 --> 54:24.585
And Wilson
sees the distinction?

54:24.653 --> 54:26.788
Well, there are rules,
Nina.

54:26.855 --> 54:28.056
Bill is right.

54:28.124 --> 54:30.191
We simply
can't keep him here.

54:30.259 --> 54:31.893
You helped us.

54:31.961 --> 54:35.596
The man shot
a federal witness.

54:35.664 --> 54:37.832
The situation
is a bit more complicated.

54:37.900 --> 54:41.002
Was it complicated with me?

54:41.070 --> 54:42.904
Nina, that was
a long time ago,

54:42.972 --> 54:44.872
before any of this.

54:44.941 --> 54:46.607
You can't compare the two.

54:46.675 --> 54:49.077
I think I just did.

54:55.583 --> 54:58.118
Who's Tyler?

54:59.854 --> 55:01.621
Wh- he's my kid.

55:01.689 --> 55:02.622
He's a pitcher.

55:02.690 --> 55:04.758
Gary, don't read my texts.

55:04.826 --> 55:06.693
You still here?

55:06.761 --> 55:09.129
Yeah. Rosen said
he wanted to talk, so...

55:09.197 --> 55:10.998
Maybe you
should come back tomorrow.

55:11.066 --> 55:12.766
I mean,
he could be a while.

55:12.834 --> 55:14.068
You think?

55:14.135 --> 55:15.802
I'm taking Gary home.
I'll drop you off.

55:15.870 --> 55:17.304
No, Dr. Rosen
is driving me.

55:17.372 --> 55:18.805
Change of plans.
We should go.

55:18.873 --> 55:21.075
Yeah, sure.

55:22.143 --> 55:23.809
Nice ride.

55:23.877 --> 55:26.079
Thanks.
I borrowed it.

55:28.115 --> 55:29.582
No.

55:29.649 --> 55:30.984
No, no.

55:31.051 --> 55:32.718
Gary, you okay?

55:32.786 --> 55:34.053
No, no.

55:34.121 --> 55:35.054
No, it's back again.

55:35.122 --> 55:36.122
Gary, what's back?

55:36.190 --> 55:37.457
It's back again.

55:37.524 --> 55:38.891
The...

55:38.959 --> 55:40.759
The signal!
Yellow and blue!

55:40.827 --> 55:41.894
The signal! The signal!

55:41.962 --> 55:42.996
Hang on
do you see something?

55:43.063 --> 55:44.130
Gary, calm down.

55:44.198 --> 55:45.731
It's the cell phone!
The cell phone!

55:45.799 --> 55:46.899
What? The Ghost?

55:46.967 --> 55:48.101
- Yes! Yes!
- Gary, are you sure?

55:48.168 --> 55:49.768
Yes, he's here!

55:49.836 --> 55:51.070
Gary, look at me.
Gary.

55:51.138 --> 55:52.105
What direction?

55:52.172 --> 55:53.706
There. He's over there.

55:53.773 --> 55:54.939
Okay, okay, okay.

55:55.008 --> 55:56.308
Hey, take care of him.
And warn Rosen!

55:56.376 --> 55:58.710
Gary, get in the car
and lock the door, okay?

55:58.777 --> 56:00.045
I need the keys.

56:00.113 --> 56:01.346
No, just get in the car!
I'm serious!

56:06.352 --> 56:08.620
10 and 2 o'clock.

56:20.500 --> 56:21.799
Hello, Don.

56:21.867 --> 56:23.101
I know what you're
going to say--

56:23.169 --> 56:25.102
Rosen, stop. That's not
what I called about.

56:25.170 --> 56:26.137
We've got a big problem.

56:26.204 --> 56:28.472
We got the wrong body.

56:28.540 --> 56:30.474
Guy who jumped off the roof
wasn't the Ghost.

56:30.542 --> 56:33.377
It was the damn bellhop.

56:33.445 --> 56:34.811
Are you sure?

56:34.879 --> 56:36.514
I'm looking
at him right now.

56:36.581 --> 56:37.981
Which raises the question,

56:38.050 --> 56:41.085
who was the guy in the room,
and where is he now?

56:48.460 --> 56:50.794
We had it all wrong.

56:50.862 --> 56:53.164
The whole case was a setup
from the very beginning.

56:53.231 --> 56:55.399
Why else
the miracle shot?

56:55.467 --> 56:58.634
Why choose an Alpha?
We were supposed to find it.

56:58.702 --> 57:01.438
Hicks <i>was</i> the Cold Charlie.

57:20.157 --> 57:22.525
We thought we were using Hicks
to draw out the Ghost,

57:22.593 --> 57:25.828
but Red Flag was using
him all along

57:25.896 --> 57:29.264
to identify their real target.

57:29.332 --> 57:31.333
What real target?

57:31.401 --> 57:32.767
Come on, Don,

57:32.835 --> 57:35.604
who's done more to disrupt
Red Flag's operations?

57:35.671 --> 57:37.939
Who's the biggest thorn
in their side?

57:38.007 --> 57:39.108
Us!

57:39.175 --> 57:40.675
Okay,
we don't have the Ghost.

57:40.743 --> 57:41.943
Now the Ghost is after us.

57:42.011 --> 57:43.245
How about
your man in the room,

57:43.313 --> 57:45.547
did he see him?
Rosen, what about Harken?

57:45.615 --> 57:47.249
Can he help us out?

57:47.317 --> 57:49.284
I'm afraid it's too late
for that, Don.

57:53.756 --> 57:55.157
Be still!

57:55.225 --> 57:56.958
Hey! Let her go!

57:57.026 --> 57:58.926
Not a step closer,
Mr. Hicks,

57:58.994 --> 58:00.461
or she dies.

58:25.654 --> 58:27.087
Bill?

58:27.156 --> 58:30.624
Bill, try and hear me.

58:30.691 --> 58:32.325
Bill, I am your friend.

58:32.393 --> 58:34.927
I am your friend, Bill.

58:34.995 --> 58:37.264
I know what you're thinking.

58:37.331 --> 58:39.799
You're thinking you can make
that shot without hitting her.

58:39.867 --> 58:42.735
- But I know you.
- No, you don't know me.

58:42.803 --> 58:44.837
I've researched you
extensively.

58:44.905 --> 58:48.007
Without my hand to guide you,

58:48.075 --> 58:50.510
you're helpless.

58:50.578 --> 58:53.213
Every time the pressure's on,
you fall apart.

58:56.417 --> 58:58.251
I am your friend, Bill.

58:58.319 --> 58:59.452
Bill.

58:59.520 --> 59:00.819
Kill me.

59:00.887 --> 59:03.789
Please, kill us all.

59:04.824 --> 59:06.392
Stop!

59:07.427 --> 59:09.161
Bill?

59:09.229 --> 59:11.430
Look at me.

59:11.498 --> 59:13.465
Listen to me.

59:13.533 --> 59:14.833
Don't do it.

59:14.901 --> 59:19.471
Don't kill him.

59:21.541 --> 59:22.675
It's not working, Nina.
He's...

59:22.742 --> 59:24.276
He's too far gone.

59:24.344 --> 59:26.044
Bill. Bill, please.

59:26.112 --> 59:28.514
You know who I am.

59:28.582 --> 59:30.349
I am your friend.

59:30.417 --> 59:32.217
Bill, please.

59:41.527 --> 59:45.663
The only way you make that
shot is if I tell you to.

59:47.966 --> 59:50.134
Now, you let me go,

59:50.202 --> 59:52.704
I let her go.

59:52.771 --> 59:54.305
It's as easy as...

01:00:02.647 --> 01:00:04.180
Are you okay?

01:00:04.249 --> 01:00:06.015
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

01:00:18.263 --> 01:00:20.731
You're on the wrong side
of this, Hicks.

01:00:20.798 --> 01:00:21.865
What?

01:00:21.932 --> 01:00:24.200
You're on
the wrong side of this.

01:00:39.924 --> 01:00:42.613
There are still a few traces
of anomalous activity

01:00:42.733 --> 01:00:44.275
in the prefrontal cortex,

01:00:44.395 --> 01:00:48.172
but it's
substantially diminished.

01:00:48.292 --> 01:00:50.933
The lesion seems
to be dissolving.

01:00:51.001 --> 01:00:53.970
And you, how are you?

01:00:54.037 --> 01:00:55.738
I'm gonna be okay.

01:00:58.156 --> 01:01:01.544
The side effects shouldn't
last more than a few days,

01:01:01.612 --> 01:01:05.615
but you have experienced
significant trauma.

01:01:05.682 --> 01:01:06.883
And in the coming weeks,

01:01:06.950 --> 01:01:10.085
you may find emotions
welling up inside you,

01:01:10.153 --> 01:01:12.889
feelings of, uh,

01:01:12.956 --> 01:01:14.790
well, sadness

01:01:14.858 --> 01:01:16.992
and, of course, fatigue.

01:01:17.059 --> 01:01:19.460
I'll keep that in mind,
Oprah.

01:01:19.529 --> 01:01:22.163
My door is always open,
Bill.

01:01:22.231 --> 01:01:24.032
Thanks, Dr. Rosen.

01:01:24.099 --> 01:01:25.734
How are you?

01:01:25.801 --> 01:01:28.403
I heard
you snuck one on me.

01:01:28.470 --> 01:01:31.506
Glad to see you
back to normal.

01:01:31.574 --> 01:01:33.775
You want a ride, H.?

01:01:35.945 --> 01:01:38.880
- Oh...
- Nice hit!

01:01:43.753 --> 01:01:44.819
He has your arm.

01:01:44.887 --> 01:01:47.955
Ah, not quite.

01:01:48.023 --> 01:01:51.559
Well, maybe
with practice, hmm?

01:01:51.626 --> 01:01:53.994
Maybe.

01:01:56.164 --> 01:01:59.533
Ah, it's hard being apart
from them, isn't it?

01:01:59.601 --> 01:02:01.134
Yeah.

01:02:01.202 --> 01:02:03.804
Yeah, but, I mean,
I get it.

01:02:03.872 --> 01:02:05.639
I drive her nuts.

01:02:05.707 --> 01:02:09.309
Well, it's not entirely
your fault, is it?

01:02:09.377 --> 01:02:14.081
Patti has no idea
what you go through.

01:02:14.148 --> 01:02:15.749
Something you
want to tell me, doc?

01:02:15.817 --> 01:02:18.785
There is so much
that I can do to help you,

01:02:18.852 --> 01:02:22.655
and there's much
that you can do to help us.

01:02:22.723 --> 01:02:24.476
Yeah, I know.

01:02:24.596 --> 01:02:26.735
And, look, I appreciate it.

01:02:26.855 --> 01:02:29.058
Really, I do, Dr. Rosen.
I know you got my back.

01:02:29.178 --> 01:02:30.308
Well, I'm not asking...

01:02:30.428 --> 01:02:31.896
No, I know
what you're asking.

01:02:32.016 --> 01:02:34.567
Believe me, I get it.

01:02:34.635 --> 01:02:36.712
But I worked
for the government before.

01:02:36.832 --> 01:02:38.050
Didn't really turn out.

01:02:38.170 --> 01:02:41.007
- Well, Cameron...
- The thing is, I just, uh...

01:02:41.075 --> 01:02:43.426
Just kind of always been
better off on my own, you know?

01:02:43.546 --> 01:02:45.893
- Of course. I completely understand.
- Thanks.

01:02:46.013 --> 01:02:50.215
But you did murder
a federal prisoner.

01:02:50.282 --> 01:02:53.126
Wait.
I couldn't control that.

01:02:53.246 --> 01:02:54.949
You--you of all people
know that.

01:02:55.054 --> 01:02:56.154
Yes, I know that,

01:02:56.222 --> 01:02:57.855
and you know that.

01:02:57.923 --> 01:02:59.224
But there
are other parties

01:02:59.291 --> 01:03:01.192
that might not be
so understanding.

01:03:03.946 --> 01:03:07.298
No, the best place
for you now is with us,

01:03:07.366 --> 01:03:09.700
where I can protect you.

01:03:12.671 --> 01:03:15.973
Come by tomorrow.
We'll get you situated.

01:03:20.100 --> 01:03:23.013
You're back on the mound,
Mr. Hicks.
