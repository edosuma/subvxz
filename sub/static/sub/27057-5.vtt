05:15.106 --> 05:16.190
It's me...

05:17.025 --> 05:19.152
-Where are you?
<i>-I can't say.</i>

05:20.111 --> 05:21.946
<i>The M.E. report came in.</i>

05:22.822 --> 05:25.825
No residue in Paavo's lungs, so...
He was dead
before the fire system went off.

05:29.495 --> 05:31.789
They can't deny Paavo was murdered.

05:32.498 --> 05:34.500
The police are looking for the guy
who was here with you.
The one with Henrik when he died.

05:37.128 --> 05:38.379
No, no, no.

05:39.005 --> 05:42.592
That's the one person I know
didn't kill Paavo.

05:42.842 --> 05:44.761
Do you want me to put you in touch
with the Inspector?

05:45.595 --> 05:47.180
What's your next move?

18:26.563 --> 18:27.981
What is it that couldn't wait?

18:29.024 --> 18:32.277
The CIA has a missing officer...
I need tracked down.

18:34.446 --> 18:35.405
How is that our job?

18:35.697 --> 18:36.824
Because I say it is.

18:39.952 --> 18:43.705
Last seen near that defunct Soviet
rail line in Turba, Estonia.

18:44.623 --> 18:47.167
They believe he's being held
by an oligarch close to the Kremlin.

18:48.085 --> 18:49.128
In St. Petersburg.

18:49.545 --> 18:51.380
Lots of classified intel here.

18:52.297 --> 18:54.258
You have a mole in Berlin Station?

18:56.301 --> 18:58.720
This is like looking for a match in hell.
It's insane, a fool's errand.

18:59.263 --> 19:00.222
Miller could be anywhere.

19:02.307 --> 19:05.352
When your op last year went south,
I cleaned up for you. No questions asked.

19:07.855 --> 19:10.357
When I said I owed you,
this isn't what I meant.

19:11.024 --> 19:14.611
You want me to stick my neck out
in savage country, no back-up...

19:17.531 --> 19:18.448
After this, we're done?

33:20.289 --> 33:21.457
<i>Don't let them out!</i>
