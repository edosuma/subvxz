WEBVTT

00:01.502 --> 00:04.505
(Phoenix's "Lisztomania"
playing)

00:05.636 --> 00:08.079
HMM.

00:08.079 --> 00:10.311
в™Є SO SENTIMENTAL в™Є

00:10.311 --> 00:13.344
в™Є NOT SENTIMENTAL, NO в™Є

00:13.344 --> 00:15.316
WHAT THE HELL IS THAT?

00:15.316 --> 00:17.748
LOOKS LIKE A FARM ANIMAL.

00:17.748 --> 00:19.590
(babbling indistinctly)

00:19.590 --> 00:22.093
в™Є FORTUNATE ONLY в™Є

00:22.093 --> 00:24.425
в™Є I'VE BEEN LOOKIN' FOR
SOMETHING ELSE, DO LET, DO LET в™Є

00:24.425 --> 00:27.128
в™Є DO LET, JUGULATE,
DO LET, DO LET в™Є

00:27.128 --> 00:29.360
в™Є LET'S GO SLOWLY,
DISCOURAGED в™Є

00:29.360 --> 00:32.463
(trills lips)

00:32.463 --> 00:34.735
CRAP!

00:34.735 --> 00:37.338
(marching band
playing fight song)

00:37.338 --> 00:39.540
WHOO! COUGARS!

00:39.540 --> 00:41.542
LET'S HEAR IT FOR THE COUGARS!

00:41.542 --> 00:42.713
(grunts)

00:42.713 --> 00:45.316
OHH! IT'S OKAY.
IT'S OKAY. I'M UP.

00:45.316 --> 00:49.420
(cheering)

00:49.420 --> 00:52.183
(whistle blows)

00:52.183 --> 00:54.685
WHOO! LET'S GO!

00:54.685 --> 00:56.287
IT'S OVER, MOM.

00:56.287 --> 00:59.059
I CAN'T HELP IT.
I GET EXCITED.
OOH, OKAY, HERE WE GO.

00:59.059 --> 01:02.463
RIGHT BACK THERE--
SON OR BOYFRIEND?

01:02.463 --> 01:05.666
I DON'T WANT TO BE A PART
OF JUDGING THAT POOR WOMAN.

01:05.666 --> 01:08.169
IT'S NOT RIGHT.
SON OR BOYFRIEND?

01:08.169 --> 01:10.201
BOYFRIEND.
COME ON. BE HIS MOM.

01:10.201 --> 01:12.773
BOYFRIEND! GET IN THERE, BUDDY!
KISS HER. KISS HER.
BE HIS MOM. MOM. MOM. MOM.

01:12.773 --> 01:15.075
COME ON! COME ON! DO IT!
KISS HER!

01:15.075 --> 01:17.608
OHH! OOH.
YES! YES!
WHAT'S THE SCORE, TRAVIS?

01:17.608 --> 01:20.811
8-NIL.
(singsong voice) WHATEVER.

01:20.811 --> 01:23.114
(whistle blows)
OH, TRAVIS.

01:23.114 --> 01:26.217
YOUR MATH TEACHER,
MS. PRITCHETT, GOT NEW BOOBS.

01:26.217 --> 01:28.088
JULES,
YOU'RE VERY, VERY OLD.

01:28.088 --> 01:30.761
WHY WOULD SHE DO
SOMETHING LIKE THAT?

01:30.761 --> 01:33.164
WOULD YOU GIVE HER A BREAK?
THE DATING POOL

01:33.164 --> 01:35.496
IS PRETTY LIMITED WHEN YOU
GET DIVORCED AT HER AGE.

01:35.496 --> 01:37.097
WHAT, YOU MEAN YOUR AGE?

01:37.097 --> 01:39.200
SHE'S, LIKE, FOUR MONTHS OLDER,
TRAVIS. (scoffs)

01:39.200 --> 01:41.101
OKAY.

01:41.101 --> 01:43.474
THE POINT IS, ALL OF
THE SINGLE GUYS OUR AGE

01:43.474 --> 01:46.507
ARE EITHER BROKEN, GAY,
OR CHASING YOUNGER GIRLS.

01:46.507 --> 01:48.139
(air horn blows)

01:48.139 --> 01:51.111
IT CAN GET PRETTY LONELY.
OH, HONEY.

01:51.111 --> 01:54.415
DON'T GET ME WRONG. I'M NOT
GONNA END UP LIKE MS. PRITCHETT.

01:54.415 --> 01:56.647
NO, I DON'T THINK YOUR FRAME
COULD HANDLE THOSE.

01:56.647 --> 01:59.320
I MEAN, IF I FELT THAT
NO ONE WOULD TALK ABOUT ME...

01:59.320 --> 02:01.622
WELL, YOU SEE THAT
YOUNG GENTLEMAN RIGHT THERE?

02:01.622 --> 02:04.525
MM.
I'D LOVE TO LICK HIS BODY.

02:04.525 --> 02:06.857
THAT'S MY SON.

02:06.857 --> 02:10.631
OH! (chuckles)
HE LOOKS SMART.

02:10.631 --> 02:13.364
AND WE'RE MOVING BACK
JUST A FEW ROWS.

02:13.364 --> 02:14.665
OKAY.

02:14.665 --> 02:18.539
(deepens voice)
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, MY MOTHER.

02:18.539 --> 02:20.641
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.

02:20.641 --> 02:23.614
SWEETIE, YOU KNOW YOU DON'T
GET TO LEAVE UNTIL I ASK YOU

02:23.614 --> 02:26.277
WHAT I ASK YOU EVERY WEEKEND.
COME ON. LET'S GO OUT.

02:26.277 --> 02:28.849
LET'S HAVE FUN.
CAN'T. GOT BIG PLANS.

02:28.849 --> 02:30.651
IT'S FRIDAY NIGHT.

02:30.651 --> 02:32.853
GET YOUR BUTT OVER HERE
FOR SOME WINE AND SCRABBLE.

02:32.853 --> 02:35.456
I CAN'T. I PROMISED MY HUSBAND
WE'D START HAVING SEX

02:35.456 --> 02:37.628
ONCE A MONTH WITHOUT IT
HAVING TO BE A QUICKIE,

02:37.628 --> 02:39.930
AND THE BASTARD ACTUALLY
CALLED ME ON IT.
WHY SO PISSY?

02:39.930 --> 02:41.832
I'M FAT.
YOU'RE NOT.

02:41.832 --> 02:44.835
I AM. I WOKE UP FAT.

02:44.835 --> 02:47.698
I DON'T BUY IT.

02:47.698 --> 02:50.601
WOW, YOU LOOK LIKE A WHORE.
THANK YOU.

02:50.601 --> 02:52.803
LET'S DO THIS, WOMAN.
(makes popping sound)

02:52.803 --> 02:56.477
UGH, I HAVE TO GO.
(beep)

02:56.477 --> 02:58.809
UH, MY HAMSTRING'S
A LITTLE TIGHT,

02:58.809 --> 03:00.881
SO YOU'RE GONNA HAVE
TO START ON TOP.

03:00.881 --> 03:05.686
IF YOU WANT, WE CAN SWITCH
IT UP ONCE I GET LOOSE.
YOU ARE SO SEXY.

03:05.686 --> 03:06.887
THANK YOU.

03:06.887 --> 03:09.520
(falsetto singsong voice)
RACE YA!
HEY.

03:09.520 --> 03:12.563
(door closes)
YOU WANT TO STAY IN,
HANG OUT ON THE COUCH

03:12.563 --> 03:14.765
AND MAYBE WATCH A MOVIE?
ARE YOU HITTING ON ME?

03:14.765 --> 03:17.768
NO, THIS WINE'S FOR ELLIE. SHE'S
BEEN LOOKING SO HOT LATELY.

03:17.768 --> 03:20.831
I THOUGHT I'D GET HER DRUNK
AND TRY TO HIT THAT.

03:20.831 --> 03:23.504
LESBIAN MOM JOKES.
AWESOME.

03:23.504 --> 03:25.806
UH, LOOK,
RYAN'S COMING TO PICK ME UP.

03:25.806 --> 03:28.509
OKAY. HOME BY MIDNIGHT,
AND IF I EVER CATCH YOU TWO

03:28.509 --> 03:31.412
DRINKING AND DRIVING, I'M GONNA
SHOW EVERYONE THAT BABY PICTURE

03:31.412 --> 03:34.685
OF YOU TWO HOLDING EACH OTHER'S
PENISES... SO SMALL. (chuckles)

03:34.685 --> 03:37.548
YOU KNOW, RYAN'S MOM
JUST SAYS GOOD-BYE.
GOOD-BYE.

03:37.548 --> 03:40.321
HAVE A GREAT NIGHT, MOM.

03:40.321 --> 03:42.423
I ALWAYS DO.

03:42.423 --> 03:45.426
(door opens and closes)

03:47.598 --> 03:49.400
YOU SEE?

03:49.400 --> 03:53.704
IT'S NOT A WALK OF SHAME
IF SOMEONE DOES IT WITH YOU.
(car door opens)

03:53.704 --> 03:55.366
CALL ME.
(engine starts)

03:55.366 --> 03:56.667
HEY, GRAYSON.

03:56.667 --> 03:58.869
YOU KNOW WHAT
DRIVES ME NUTS?

03:58.869 --> 04:01.472
IS IT PEOPLE
THAT START CONVERSATIONS

04:01.472 --> 04:03.013
WITHOUT SAYING HELLO?
NO.

04:03.013 --> 04:05.616
IS IT ANNOYING NEIGHBORS?
NO.

04:05.616 --> 04:08.018
IS IT STONE PHILLIPS?
WHAT? YOUR WIFE MOVES OUT,
WHAT, A WEEK AGO?

04:08.018 --> 04:10.321
AND YOU'RE ALREADY
SEXING UP SORORITY GIRLS.

04:10.321 --> 04:12.783
BUT NOBODY CARES, BECAUSE WHEN
A 40-YEAR-OLD GUY GETS DIVORCED,

04:12.783 --> 04:16.927
ALL YOUR FRIENDS ARE LIKE,
"OH, WAY TO GO, TIGER!"
WE DON'T CALL EACH OTHER
"TIGER."

04:16.927 --> 04:19.259
IT'S ALWAYS "CHAMP"
OR "SAMURAI."

04:19.259 --> 04:23.033
LOOK, MAYBE WHAT REALLY
DRIVES YOU NUTS IS THAT

04:23.033 --> 04:27.538
YOU COULDN'T BAG
A YOUNG STUD IF YOU TRIED.
(scoffs)
YOU DON'T THINK I COULD?

04:27.538 --> 04:31.902
MNH-MNH.
WELL, I'M NOT GONNA GIVE YOU
THE SATISFACTION. TOO BAD.

04:31.902 --> 04:35.876
OH, THE HELL WITH IT.
HEY, KID! POW!

04:37.708 --> 04:39.750
OOH.
OOH!

04:39.750 --> 04:43.053
(singsong voice) SUCK IT.

04:43.053 --> 04:51.592
в™Єв™Є

04:51.592 --> 04:54.525
(speaking indistinctly)

04:54.525 --> 04:57.828
I'M GUESSING THE BOY THAT
I FLASHED GOES TO YOUR SCHOOL.

04:57.828 --> 04:59.500
HE DOES.

04:59.500 --> 05:01.872
IS HE SINGLE?

05:05.075 --> 05:07.007
WHY DON'T YOU EVER
LAUGH AT MY JOKES?

05:07.007 --> 05:09.810
BECAUSE THEY MAKE ME SAD.

05:09.810 --> 05:12.082
OH, BOO-HOO.
(starts engine)

05:12.082 --> 05:13.744
UH, RYAN?

05:13.744 --> 05:16.687
TELL HIM I LOVE HIM.
I GOT YOU.

05:16.687 --> 05:18.749
OH, CALM DOWN.
TRAVIS WILL BE FINE.

05:18.749 --> 05:21.452
(brakes screech)
WHOA!
UH, GIVE A GIRL A WARNING.

05:21.452 --> 05:23.454
MY UTERUS ALMOST SHOT OUT.

05:24.995 --> 05:27.027
WHAT DID YOU DO?!

05:27.027 --> 05:29.760
THIS IS NOT THE PHOTO
I PICKED!

05:29.760 --> 05:32.433
(sighs)
THIS IS FROM THAT NIGHT
THAT WE GOT DRUNK ON AMARETTO

05:32.433 --> 05:35.566
AND PLAYED DRESS-UP!
I DON'T CARE IF YOU FIRE ME.

05:35.566 --> 05:38.068
I AM PUTTING YOU BACK
OUT THERE. IT'S TIME.

05:38.068 --> 05:40.911
JUST LISTEN TO ME FOR ONCE.
I LISTENED TO YOU WHEN YOU

05:40.911 --> 05:43.774
TOLD ME DALE WAS A LOSER,
AND I HAD TO STOP DATING HIM.

05:43.774 --> 05:45.776
WHAT? WHAT?
YOU HAVE A GIANT HICKEY
ON YOUR CHEST,

05:45.776 --> 05:48.449
AND I CAN TELL IT'S DALE'S,
BECAUSE WHOEVER DID IT

05:48.449 --> 05:49.750
HAS A TOOTH MISSING!

05:52.383 --> 05:54.885
OH, WE'RE NOT TALKING
FOR SIX MINUTES?

05:54.885 --> 05:55.986
MM.

05:55.986 --> 05:57.988
(tires screech)

06:03.964 --> 06:08.739
(birds calling)

06:08.739 --> 06:10.771
IT'S BEEN ABOUT SIX MINUTES.

06:10.771 --> 06:13.043
LOOK, IT'S JUST YOU'VE BEEN
DIVORCED FOR FIVE MONTHS,

06:13.043 --> 06:16.046
AND YOU'RE NOT HAVING ANY FUN.
OH, GOOD GOD.

06:16.046 --> 06:18.549
HEY, BARB.

06:18.549 --> 06:20.611
AND GOOD MORNING TO YOU.

06:20.611 --> 06:24.384
THE HANNIGANS WOULD LIKE
TO SEE UPSTAIRS.
TAKE AS MUCH TIME AS YOU NEED.

06:24.384 --> 06:26.917
THE MASTER BEDROOM'S
ON THE RIGHT... (lowers voice)

06:26.917 --> 06:29.760
IF YOU WANT TO SEE WHERE
YOUR THOUSAND-YEAR-OLD HUSBAND

06:29.760 --> 06:32.993
WILL EVENTUALLY DIE
ON TOP OF YOU.
I'M ONLY 64.

06:32.993 --> 06:36.727
(normal voice) GREAT ACOUSTICS,
HUH? IT'S A LOVELY HOME.

06:36.727 --> 06:38.969
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'M NOT EVEN ASKING ANYMORE.

06:38.969 --> 06:41.502
TONIGHT IS THE NIGHT.
WE'RE GOING ON THE PROWL!

06:41.502 --> 06:44.074
NO! NO PROWLING.
LOOK, YOU'RE YOUNG.

06:44.074 --> 06:46.507
(sighs)
ME, I HAVE TO ACT MY AGE.

06:46.507 --> 06:48.479
I MEAN, ONE NIGHT
OUT ON THE PROWL,

06:48.479 --> 06:50.911
AND THE NEXT THING YOU KNOW,
I'M AT A JONAS BROTHERS CONCERT

06:50.911 --> 06:52.843
WEARING A MINISKIRT,

06:52.843 --> 06:55.886
SPORTING SOME GIANT
COLLAGEN HOT DOG LIPS.
ARE YOU MAKING FUN OF MY MOM?

06:55.886 --> 06:58.549
MAYBE. I'M ALSO SAYING THAT

06:58.549 --> 07:01.021
I JUST DON'T WANT TO BECOME
SOMEONE THAT I MAKE FUN OF.

07:01.021 --> 07:03.854
FINE.
HONEY, WE DON'T HAVE TO PROWL.

07:03.854 --> 07:05.856
LET'S JUST GO GET A DRINK.

07:05.856 --> 07:07.658
JUST A DRINK?
YES.

07:07.658 --> 07:09.900
OKAY, LET'S DO IT.

07:09.900 --> 07:11.131
YAY! (giggles)

07:11.131 --> 07:13.664
AND TAKE ME SOMEPLACE
YOUNG AND FUN.

07:13.664 --> 07:17.037
I DON'T WANT TO GO SOMEWHERE
FILLED WITH WRINKLED OLD GEEZERS

07:17.037 --> 07:19.770
LIKE GRANDPA IN THERE.
I'M RIGHT ABOVE YOU.

07:19.770 --> 07:21.041
YES, YOU ARE.

07:21.041 --> 07:23.744
PLEASE BUY THE HOUSE.

07:26.617 --> 07:27.748
(sighs)

07:27.748 --> 07:29.880
WHAT DO YOU WANT, BOBBY?

07:29.880 --> 07:33.754
HEY, JULES. I NEED THIS MONTH'S
ALIMONY CHECK A LITTLE EARLY.

07:33.754 --> 07:35.926
HOW EARLY?
LIKE NOW.

07:35.926 --> 07:39.490
OF COURSE.
COME ON, J-BIRD.
TRAVIS IS AT MY PLACE TONIGHT,

07:39.490 --> 07:41.892
AND I'D LIKE TO BE ABLE TO,
YOU KNOW, FEED HIM.

07:41.892 --> 07:43.794
I CAN'T BELIEVE
I MARRIED YOU.

07:43.794 --> 07:46.166
(chuckles)
YEAH, THAT WAS A BAD CALL.

07:48.939 --> 07:52.102
YOU KNOW, OPRAH SAID THAT
WHEN A MARRIAGE FALLS APART,

07:52.102 --> 07:55.075
THAT, UH, YOU KNOW, BOTH PEOPLE
HAVE TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY

07:55.075 --> 07:58.779
FOR THEIR ROLES.
I DROPPED OUT OF COLLEGE TO
SUPPORT YOU AND RAISE OUR KID

07:58.779 --> 08:01.181
WHILE YOU SPENT 20 YEARS
TRYING TO MAKE IT ON THE TOUR,

08:01.181 --> 08:02.883
DRILLING EVERYTHING
THAT MOVED.

08:02.883 --> 08:04.885
AND MAYBE YOU SHOULD
ASK YOURSELF

08:04.885 --> 08:07.087
WHAT YOU DID
TO MAKE ME DO THAT.
OH, GOD.

08:07.087 --> 08:12.022
I'M KIDDING. I'M KIDDING, OKAY?
I KNOW I WAS AN--I WAS AN ASS.

08:12.022 --> 08:15.065
HEY, FOR OLD TIMES' SAKE,

08:15.065 --> 08:18.929
DO YOU WANT TO GO UPSTAIRS
AND HAVE SEX?

08:18.929 --> 08:21.832
MMM.
YEAH.

08:21.832 --> 08:25.235
I DON'T.
(laughs)

08:25.235 --> 08:28.639
STAN.
MY BABY'S NAME IS STAN.

08:28.639 --> 08:31.211
HE'D BE SPENCER
IF MY HUSBAND'S STUPID FATHER

08:31.211 --> 08:33.684
HADN'T GONE AND DIED LIKE
A WEEK BEFORE HE WAS BORN.

08:33.684 --> 08:35.515
STILL A LITTLE FRESH.

08:35.515 --> 08:38.088
YOU'RE ALL RIGHT.
OH, YEAH, I'M FINE.

08:38.088 --> 08:40.691
COME OVER TONIGHT
FOR WINE AND SCRABBLE

08:40.691 --> 08:43.223
without the Scrabble.
OH, I CAN'T.
I'M--I'M WITH LAURIE.

08:43.223 --> 08:45.996
YOU KNOW, EVER SINCE
YOU GOT DIVORCED,

08:45.996 --> 08:49.760
she's been trying
to steal you from me.
NO, IT'S--
THIS IS A WORK THING.

08:49.760 --> 08:51.301
BYE, JULES.
(beep)

08:56.837 --> 08:59.640
HEY, THANKS FOR DINNER, DAD.
HEY, YOU BETCHA.

08:59.640 --> 09:03.073
HOW'S MOM DOING?
DOES SHE TALK ABOUT ME AT ALL?

09:03.073 --> 09:06.817
(grunts)
EH, THE BIGGEST MISTAKE OF
MY LIFE, SCREWING THAT ONE UP.

09:09.650 --> 09:12.953
MOM'S FINE. SHE'S... I MEAN,
I WISH SHE DIDN'T HAVE TO SAY

09:12.953 --> 09:16.827
EXACTLY WHAT SHE'S THINKING
THE SECOND SHE THINKS IT.

09:16.827 --> 09:20.560
WOW, YOU ARE REALLY BLACK.

09:20.560 --> 09:23.293
IT'S SO HANDSOME ON YOU.
YEAH, IT IS.

09:23.293 --> 09:25.295
COME ON, SWEETIE.

09:27.968 --> 09:31.742
GO GET 'EM.
YEAH. GET 'EM.

09:33.704 --> 09:36.607
OH!

09:36.607 --> 09:37.908
AHEM.

09:44.214 --> 09:47.217
(La Roux's "Bulletproof"
playing)

09:48.789 --> 09:51.762
OKAY, WHY ARE YOU
STANDING LIKE THAT?

09:51.762 --> 09:53.694
IT'S A LITTLE CHILLY IN HERE.

09:53.694 --> 09:55.696
ALSO I NEVER REALLY
HAD MY 20s,

09:55.696 --> 09:57.828
SO I HAVE NO IDEA HOW
I'M SUPPOSED TO LOOK OR ACT.

09:57.828 --> 10:00.701
AND YOU SAID THIS PLACE DOESN'T
EVEN GET "CRACKALACKIN'"

10:00.701 --> 10:02.833
UNTIL 9:30, AND YOU KNOW,
IF I'M UP AFTER 10:00,

10:02.833 --> 10:06.637
I GET REALLY SLEEPY,
AND I JUST--I HATE YOU.
OKAY, SAY SOMETHING
JUDGMENTAL ABOUT ME.

10:06.637 --> 10:09.379
THAT ALWAYS LOOSENS YOU UP.
YOU CAN'T WEAR FAKE NAILS
ON JUST ONE HAND.

10:09.379 --> 10:12.612
YOU LOOK LIKE A CRAZY WHORE.
WELL, I ONLY HAD FOUR LEFT,

10:12.612 --> 10:15.846
AND THIS IS THE HAND
THAT I SMOKE WITH. BETTER?
MM.

10:15.846 --> 10:19.019
GOOD. NOW GIVE ME 20 BUCKS.
I'LL BUY YOU A DRINK.
UNBELIEVABLE.

10:19.019 --> 10:20.651
(mouths word)

10:20.651 --> 10:22.292
в™Єв™Є

10:22.292 --> 10:25.325
BARB.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

10:25.325 --> 10:27.758
HAVING A GLASS OF PINOT
WITH MY FRIENDS,

10:27.758 --> 10:30.701
TRYING TO DECIDE WHO GETS
TO SPIN ME LIKE A PINWHEEL.

10:30.701 --> 10:32.002
GOOD LUCK WITH THAT.

10:32.002 --> 10:35.666
I'M GONNA GO RIGHT OVER HERE.
OH, GOD!
(grunts)

10:35.666 --> 10:38.208
UH... NONE GOT ON ME.

10:38.208 --> 10:41.772
в™Є THIS TIME, BABY в™Є

10:41.772 --> 10:43.744
в™Є I'LL BE в™Є

10:43.744 --> 10:46.416
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU WENT
TO COLLEGE IN LONDON.

10:46.416 --> 10:49.049
I ALWAYS WANTED
TO DO STUFF LIKE THAT.
WHY DIDN'T YOU?

10:49.049 --> 10:51.081
YOU KNOW HOW IT GOES.
I WAS 19.

10:51.081 --> 10:53.383
I STARTED THINKING
WITH MY COOCHIE-COOCH,

10:53.383 --> 10:55.826
AND THEN BAM, I HAD A KID.

10:55.826 --> 10:57.888
в™Є I WON'T LET YOU TURN AROUND
AND TELL ME NOW в™Є

10:57.888 --> 11:02.162
MAN, YOU ARE HOT AS BALLS.

11:02.162 --> 11:03.433
THANKS.

11:03.433 --> 11:05.696
I'M SORRY.
THIS IS MY SECOND DRINK.

11:05.696 --> 11:08.368
LET ME GET YOU A WATER.
(chuckles) THANKS.

11:08.368 --> 11:10.971
DON'T EAT 'EM ALL.

11:10.971 --> 11:12.703
OOH. MMM.

11:12.703 --> 11:14.745
в™Є LIFE'S TOO SHORT
FOR ME TO STOP в™Є

11:14.745 --> 11:16.907
в™Є OH, BABY,
YOUR TIME IS RUNNING OUT в™Є

11:16.907 --> 11:18.749
(clenches teeth) STOP IT!

11:18.749 --> 11:21.782
в™Є I WON'T LET YOU TURN AROUND
AND TELL ME NOW в™Є

11:21.782 --> 11:23.714
в™Є I'M MUCH TOO PROUD в™Є

11:23.714 --> 11:26.957
HEY, I THINK THAT CHICK WENT
TO HIGH SCHOOL WITH MY MOM.

11:26.957 --> 11:30.120
в™Є THIS TIME, BABY, I'LL BE в™Є

11:30.120 --> 11:32.392
(groans)

11:32.392 --> 11:34.795
в™Є BULLETPROOF в™Є

11:34.795 --> 11:37.297
в™Є THIS TIME, BABY, I'LL BE... в™Є

11:39.069 --> 11:41.701
STOP HAVING SEX
WITH BABIES!

11:41.701 --> 11:42.833
HI!

11:42.833 --> 11:45.105
AND A HOODIE? REALLY?

11:45.105 --> 11:47.437
I MEAN, IF YOU WANT HER
TO THINK YOU'RE THAT YOUNG,

11:47.437 --> 11:49.740
WHY DON'T YOU JUST
WEAR THOSE P.J.s

11:49.740 --> 11:52.813
WITH THE FEET ON THEM?!
OKAY, WE SHOULD PROBABLY GO.

11:54.885 --> 11:57.287
(telephone rings)

11:57.287 --> 11:58.789
(beep)

11:58.789 --> 11:59.920
HELLO?

11:59.920 --> 12:02.392
GOOD. YOU'RE HOME.
COME OVER.

12:04.795 --> 12:07.227
OH, GOD!
WHOA!

12:07.227 --> 12:11.501
HEY! (laughing) YOU LEFT THAT
AT THE BAR, BITCH!

12:11.501 --> 12:13.103
NO! WAIT!

12:13.103 --> 12:15.766
WHOO!
DO NOT LEAVE!

12:15.766 --> 12:17.737
(Laurie) BYE!
OHH! HI.

12:17.737 --> 12:19.770
MAY I COME IN?

12:19.770 --> 12:21.942
SURE.

12:28.919 --> 12:31.481
THAT DIDN'T WORK, DID IT?
NO.

12:31.481 --> 12:33.523
DAMN IT!

12:33.523 --> 12:35.055
UM...

12:35.055 --> 12:37.487
CAN I GET YOU A SNACK?

12:37.487 --> 12:39.830
THAT--THAT'S WHAT I DO
FOR MY SON'S FRIENDS.

12:39.830 --> 12:42.062
I GET THEM SNACKS.

12:42.062 --> 12:44.764
DO YOU LIKE CRACKERS
WITH PEANUT BUTTER ON THEM?

12:44.764 --> 12:47.397
HOPE IT'S NOT TOO FORWARD
COMING OVER HERE.

12:47.397 --> 12:50.270
YOU'RE A GOOD KID, BUT, UH...
(makes clicking noise)

12:50.270 --> 12:52.472
THIS ISN'T REALLY
HOW I ROLL, OKAY?

12:52.472 --> 12:56.246
SO... HOLY CRAP.
(telephone rings)

12:56.246 --> 12:59.880
WHERE THE HELL ARE YOU?
(whispering)
THERE'S A MAN IN MY HOUSE.

12:59.880 --> 13:03.413
SHOULD I CALL THE POLICE?
NO. I LIED TO YOU,
AND I WENT TO A BAR.

13:03.413 --> 13:05.956
OH, JUST GO LOOK AT HIM.

13:08.788 --> 13:10.790
WHAT? WHO IS THAT?

13:14.164 --> 13:15.495
COME ON!

13:15.495 --> 13:18.798
GO DO DISGUSTING THINGS
TO THAT BOY.

13:18.798 --> 13:21.801
NO. I-I NEED TIME TO PREPARE.
I GOT--I GOTTA BUY CANDLES.

13:21.801 --> 13:23.573
I LOOK REALLY GOOD
IN FLICKERING LIGHT.

13:23.573 --> 13:27.137
OH, MY GOD. WHAT IF HE WANTS
TO LEAVE THE LIGHTS ON?
YOU'RE GOOD AT SEX, RIGHT?

13:27.137 --> 13:31.311
OH, I'M LIKE A 7.
I'M A 9. NOW LOOK, JUST TAKE
CHARGE OF THE SITUATION

13:31.311 --> 13:34.284
THE SECOND YOU WALK
IN THE ROOM.

13:36.446 --> 13:37.918
(hand banging wall)

13:42.452 --> 13:46.126
HEY. (chuckles)

13:46.126 --> 13:48.528
I WANT TO SEE YOU.

13:48.528 --> 13:50.460
FANTASTIC.

13:50.460 --> 13:51.501
WHAT'S THAT SCAR FROM?

13:51.501 --> 13:54.204
UH, I GOT KNIFED
WHEN I WAS A KID.

13:54.204 --> 13:57.567
REALLY?
NOPE.
THAT'S FROM MY C-SECTION.

13:57.567 --> 13:59.910
WHAT AM I DOING?

13:59.910 --> 14:01.271
ALL RIGHT.

14:01.271 --> 14:03.443
AND NO MORE TALKING.

14:07.577 --> 14:10.220
I FEEL LIKE
I CAN SEE COLORS AGAIN.

14:10.220 --> 14:12.482
YEAH. AND THANKS
FOR MAKING THESE CRACKERS.

14:12.482 --> 14:15.185
(mouth full) EVER SINCE
YOU MENTIONED 'EM BEFORE,

14:15.185 --> 14:17.187
I COULDN'T GET 'EM
OUT OF MY HEAD.

14:17.187 --> 14:19.629
WE HAD SEX THREE TIMES
WITHOUT YOU NEEDING A NAP

14:19.629 --> 14:21.861
OR PILLS OR ANYTHING.

14:21.861 --> 14:24.864
HOW FUN IS THAT?
PRETTY FUN.

14:24.864 --> 14:26.897
YEAH! (chuckles)

14:26.897 --> 14:29.039
OKAY, UM...

14:29.039 --> 14:30.870
MATT.
MATT.

14:30.870 --> 14:34.044
I'M GONNA DO SOMETHING THAT
I HAVE NOT DONE IN YEARS.

14:34.044 --> 14:36.546
I TOLD MY HUSBAND
THAT I HATED IT,

14:36.546 --> 14:39.079
BUT I DON'T HATE IT.
I LOVE IT.

14:39.079 --> 14:40.951
SO WHAT ARE YOU GONNA--

14:40.951 --> 14:44.014
SHH, SHH, SHH. JUST WATCH.

14:48.358 --> 14:49.519
MOM?

14:49.519 --> 14:52.162
OH, THERE'S MY BOY!

14:55.625 --> 14:58.398
YOU SAID YOU HATED THAT.

14:58.398 --> 15:00.630
(chuckles nervously)

15:12.482 --> 15:14.584
HEY!

15:14.584 --> 15:17.387
YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED
TO EAT THESE ANYMORE.
(thud)

15:17.387 --> 15:19.449
ALL RIGHT, I'M SO SORRY.

15:19.449 --> 15:21.451
IT'S JUST THAT LATELY
I'VE BEEN FEELING LIKE

15:21.451 --> 15:24.194
I'M GONNA SHRIVEL UP AND DIE
IF I JUST DON'T GET OUT THERE

15:24.194 --> 15:28.058
AND START DOING THINGS.
OBVIOUSLY, BY "DOING THINGS,"

15:28.058 --> 15:30.560
I DON'T MEAN ONLY THINGS
LIKE WHAT YOU SAW.

15:30.560 --> 15:33.063
OKAY, WE'RE GONNA
TALK ABOUT THAT LATER.

15:34.704 --> 15:37.567
OKAY,
I MAY HAVE TO KILL MYSELF.

15:40.170 --> 15:44.444
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
YOU NEVER CALLED ME BACK LAST
NIGHT TO TELL ME WHAT HAPPENED.

15:44.444 --> 15:47.117
SEE, I USED TO BE
YOUR BEST FRIEND.

15:47.117 --> 15:50.250
BUT NOW MY ONLY OPTION IS
TO COME HERE AND LISTEN TO YOU

15:50.250 --> 15:53.423
SHARE EVERYTHING ABOUT
YOUR LIFE WITH THIS IDIOT.
SHE'S BEEN HERE
FOR 40 MINUTES,

15:53.423 --> 15:58.228
AND THAT'S THE NICEST THING
SHE'S SAID.
WE'RE HAVING GROWN-UP TALK.
GO PUSH STAN AROUND THE BLOCK.

15:58.228 --> 16:00.991
(chuckles) "STAN"?
IS YOUR BABY 60?
(gasps)

16:00.991 --> 16:02.492
PLEASE? FOR ME?
(Stan whimpers)

16:02.492 --> 16:04.594
YEAH, LAURIE, PLEASE?
FOR HER.

16:04.594 --> 16:06.436
UGH!

16:08.338 --> 16:09.669
(whispers) HEY.

16:09.669 --> 16:13.373
(falsetto singsong voice)
HI, TRAVIS! IT'S ME, MAMA!

16:13.373 --> 16:15.475
(boys laugh)
NOT TODAY, MAN.
I'M WARNING YOU.

16:15.475 --> 16:17.477
(normal voice) YOU KNOW WHY

16:17.477 --> 16:19.479
ALL THE JUNIOR HIGH BOYS
ARE STEALING THESE?

16:19.479 --> 16:23.513
(falsetto singsong voice)
I KNOW, AND I LIKE IT!

16:23.513 --> 16:27.987
(laughter)

16:27.987 --> 16:30.190
I'M SORRY I LIED TO YOU.

16:30.190 --> 16:31.621
I KNOW YOU HAVE
YOUR OWN PROBLEMS.

16:31.621 --> 16:34.324
YOU THINK MY MOM'S HOT NOW?
HOW ABOUT NOW?
(crowd shouting)

16:34.324 --> 16:36.296
HOW ABOUT NOW?
HOW ABOUT NOW?

16:36.296 --> 16:38.628
BUT YOU AND I HAD
A PLAN, REMEMBER?

16:38.628 --> 16:40.430
WE WERE GONNA HAVE
STUPID COOKOUTS

16:40.430 --> 16:43.503
WITH OUR STUPID HUSBANDS--
HUSBANDS ARE SO STUPID.

16:43.503 --> 16:45.535
NOW I'M STUCK AT HOME,

16:45.535 --> 16:48.408
AND YOU'RE HEADING
BACK OUT INTO THE WORLD.

16:48.408 --> 16:51.181
I JUST WANT YOU TO STILL
HAVE TIME FOR ME.

16:51.181 --> 16:52.482
I LOVE YOU.

16:52.482 --> 16:55.345
I LOVE YOU SO MUCH MORE
THAN YOU LOVE ME.

16:55.345 --> 16:56.646
I KNOW, BUT IT'S CLOSE.

16:56.646 --> 16:59.389
ELLIE, I WILL ALWAYS
HAVE TIME FOR YOU.

16:59.389 --> 17:01.551
(telephone rings)

17:01.551 --> 17:03.423
(ring)

17:03.423 --> 17:06.726
I DON'T WANT TO SEE HIM DOING
ANY MORE HITTING WITH THE SIGN.

17:06.726 --> 17:09.629
JUST GO. GO!
JUST GO GET YOUR STUFF.

17:09.629 --> 17:13.233
I AM.
HE DOES NOT LOOK HAPPY.

17:13.233 --> 17:14.664
THE SCHOOL CALLED YOU?

17:14.664 --> 17:17.337
OH, NO, I'M, UH, I'M HERE
ON AN UNRELATED MATTER.

17:17.337 --> 17:20.039
APPARENTLY THERE'S A, UH,
LANDSCAPING POSITION

17:20.039 --> 17:22.442
THAT I MIGHT POTENTIALLY
BE INTERESTED IN.

17:22.442 --> 17:25.615
YES! DAD, PLEASE MOW
THE LAWNS AT MY SCHOOL.

17:25.615 --> 17:27.577
THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT I NEED!

17:27.577 --> 17:30.480
HE WAS SUPPOSED TO STAY
AT YOUR APARTMENT LAST NIGHT.

17:30.480 --> 17:34.384
COULDN'T YOU COME THROUGH
FOR ME JUST ONCE?!

17:34.384 --> 17:37.657
READY, MR. COBB?
YOU GOT IT, BROTHER.

17:37.657 --> 17:42.332
LOOK, I KNOW YOU AND I HAD A BIT
OF AN AWKWARD MOMENT LAST NIGHT.
(scoffs)

17:42.332 --> 17:44.464
YES, "AWKWARD MOMENT."
THAT'S WHAT I'M CALLING IT.

17:44.464 --> 17:46.566
STILL, THERE'S NEVER
AN EXCUSE FOR VIOLENCE.

17:46.566 --> 17:49.439
JUNIOR HIGH KIDS
ARE STEALING YOUR SIGNS.

17:49.439 --> 17:52.242
DO YOU KNOW WHY?
BECAUSE THEY'RE USING THEM

17:52.242 --> 17:54.274
TO PLEASURE THEMSELVES!
REALLY? I MEAN, REALLY?

17:54.274 --> 17:59.179
WHY CAN'T YOU JUST BE A NORMAL
MOM AND STOP TORTURING ME?!

17:59.179 --> 18:01.411
I'M ALLOWED TO HAVE
A LIFE, TRAVIS!

18:01.411 --> 18:05.555
(door slams)
HEY, DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.
HE'LL BE FINE.

18:05.555 --> 18:08.558
I MEAN, DON'T GET ME WRONG.
THANKS TO YOU, THAT KID...

18:08.558 --> 18:11.391
(whispers) IS GONNA HAVE
SOME ISSUES. BIG ONES.

18:11.391 --> 18:13.693
(laughs)

18:13.693 --> 18:15.425
(grunts)
(thud)

18:15.425 --> 18:18.328
OHH! WHO PUSHES PEOPLE?

18:18.328 --> 18:20.570
NEVER AN EXCUSE
FOR VIOLENCE, MOM!

18:20.570 --> 18:23.273
GET BACK IN THE DAMN HOUSE!

18:23.273 --> 18:25.475
HEY, TRAVIS.

18:25.475 --> 18:27.777
YOU KNOW WHAT? I'M NOT TAKING
LIP FROM THE TYPICAL JERK

18:27.777 --> 18:30.140
WHO WALKS AWAY FROM
HIS MARRIAGE SCOT-FREE,

18:30.140 --> 18:31.641
NO RESPONSIBILITIES,
NOTHING.

18:31.641 --> 18:34.614
DO YOU KNOW HOW SCARY IT IS TO
BE A SINGLE, 40-YEAR-OLD WOMAN?

18:34.614 --> 18:37.447
WHATEVER YOU DO,
YOU FEEL JUDGED BY THE WORLD.

18:37.447 --> 18:39.449
YOU FEEL JUDGED BY YOURSELF.

18:39.449 --> 18:42.152
AND IF YOU EVER,
DEEP-DOWN,

18:42.152 --> 18:43.853
THINK YOU MIGHT GET MARRIED
AGAIN, YOU'RE NOT GOING TO--

18:43.853 --> 18:46.456
NOT WHEN YOU'RE 50, AND YOU
CAN'T MAKE BABIES ANYMORE,

18:46.456 --> 18:49.429
AND YOUR LOOKS HAVE FADED.

18:49.429 --> 18:51.901
SO YOU PUT ON A BRAVE FACE,
AND YOU TRY REALLY HARD

18:51.901 --> 18:54.534
NOT TO THINK ABOUT
THE FACT THAT MAYBE,

18:54.534 --> 18:57.237
MAYBE THIS IS ALL YOUR LIFE
IS EVER GONNA BE!

18:57.237 --> 19:01.471
YOU KNOW, MY GRANDDADDY GOT
A CHICK PREGNANT WHEN HE WAS 90.

19:01.471 --> 19:03.673
OHH!
AAH!

19:05.475 --> 19:08.418
AFTERNOON.
ANDY.

19:08.418 --> 19:11.881
SAMURAI.

19:11.881 --> 19:16.556
(whispers, singsong voice)
I THINK THEY ARE GOING TO BUY.

19:16.556 --> 19:18.758
(normal voice) THANK GOD.

19:18.758 --> 19:21.191
'CAUSE I REALLY NEED
THE CASH TO DO MY FACE.

19:21.191 --> 19:23.493
HOW DOES THIS LOOK?
LIKE YOU'RE SKYDIVING?

19:23.493 --> 19:25.495
EH...
(mutters indistinctly)

19:25.495 --> 19:29.569
HEY, NICE PULL
WITH THAT HOTTIE, SISTER.

19:29.569 --> 19:33.603
I MAY TRY AND GET ON HIM
MYSELF TONIGHT.

19:36.546 --> 19:38.378
YOU OKAY, SWEETIE?

19:38.378 --> 19:40.450
YOU HAVING A LITTLE STROKE?

19:40.450 --> 19:42.752
(sighs) ONE TIME.

19:42.752 --> 19:46.816
I DID IT ONE TIME,
AND I'M ALREADY ONE OF THEM.

19:51.521 --> 19:54.524
(clears throat)

19:54.524 --> 19:56.526
(whispers) DON'T SPOOK HIM.

20:02.572 --> 20:04.804
HEY, LITTLE GUY.

20:04.804 --> 20:07.437
(gasps)

20:15.915 --> 20:18.448
AAH! HURRY!

20:25.925 --> 20:28.928
(panting) WE GOT THE SIGN BACK.
CAN WE STOP SPRINTING NOW?

20:28.928 --> 20:31.501
I FEEL LIKE MY BOOBS
ARE TRYING TO KILL ME.

20:31.501 --> 20:33.503
(door closes)

20:33.503 --> 20:36.506
(doorbell ringing)

20:36.506 --> 20:38.368
HI.
HI.

20:38.368 --> 20:41.441
MAY I TALK TO YOUR SON?
(sighs)

20:46.676 --> 20:50.320
ROBBIE, THERE ARE
SOME WOMEN HERE WHO--
HI, ROBBIE!

20:50.320 --> 20:51.621
HI.

20:51.621 --> 20:54.424
YOU OBVIOUSLY KNOW MY NAME.
THIS IS LAURIE.

20:54.424 --> 20:56.486
HEY, ROBBIE. YOU'RE FAST.

20:56.486 --> 20:59.289
ROBBIE, DO YOU KNOW HOW
EMBARRASSING IT CAN BE

20:59.289 --> 21:00.990
TO BE A TEENAGE BOY?

21:00.990 --> 21:04.764
YEAH, I-I THINK I DO.
WELL, IT'S REALLY ROUGH
ON MY SON.

21:04.764 --> 21:08.868
(Foghat) в™Є TAKE IT EASY в™Є
(falsetto voice)
в™Є TAKE IT EASY в™Є

21:08.868 --> 21:11.571
(normal voice)
WHAT'S HAPPENING, LITTLE MAN?

21:13.443 --> 21:15.605
DAD.

21:15.605 --> 21:17.276
HIT THE BOOKS.

21:17.276 --> 21:19.649
в™Є SLOW RIDE в™Є

21:21.751 --> 21:24.454
в™Є TAKE IT EASY в™Є
(falsetto voice)
в™Є TAKE IT EASY в™Є

21:24.454 --> 21:26.456
AND I KNOW IT WOULD
PROBABLY BE EASIER ON HIM

21:26.456 --> 21:28.458
IF I JUST HID OUT
IN THE HOUSE.

21:28.458 --> 21:31.290
I MEAN HELL, PROBABLY MAKE
A LOT OF PEOPLE HAPPY.

21:31.290 --> 21:35.595
I THINK SHE'S HOME,
BUT I'M NOT CALLING HER FIRST.

21:35.595 --> 21:38.598
BE NICE TO JULES.
SHE'S ALL ALONE,

21:38.598 --> 21:41.070
AND YOU'VE ALREADY WON.

21:41.070 --> 21:42.902
I CAN'T BELIEVE
I'M TURNED ON.

21:42.902 --> 21:44.934
I MEAN, I'D DATE
GUYS MY OWN AGE,

21:44.934 --> 21:47.036
BUT THEY'RE ALL OUT
DATING YOUNGER GIRLS.

21:47.036 --> 21:48.938
(flash charging)

21:48.938 --> 21:52.582
THIS ISN'T ANYTHING WEIRD.
IT'S JUST TO CHEER UP A FRIEND.

21:52.582 --> 21:54.083
(beep)

21:54.083 --> 21:56.015
GREAT. LET'S GO HAVE SEX.

21:56.015 --> 21:58.418
SO WHAT THE HELL
AM I SUPPOSED TO DO?

21:58.418 --> 22:00.550
I-I SHOULD--
YOU'RE RIGHT, ROBBIE.

22:00.550 --> 22:03.393
WE'RE NOT GONNA FIGURE IT OUT
TODAY, ARE WE?

22:03.393 --> 22:05.925
ALL I KNOW IS,
MY SON DOESN'T LIKE IT

22:05.925 --> 22:08.428
WHEN YOU BOYS TAKE MY SIGNS.

22:08.428 --> 22:11.361
(grunts)
SO YOU PUT THE WORD OUT,
OKAY?

22:11.361 --> 22:12.932
IT'S OVER.

22:15.665 --> 22:19.068
OH, YOU TORTURED
THAT POOR KID FOR ME?

22:19.068 --> 22:20.640
OUTSTANDING!

22:20.640 --> 22:22.742
LOOK...

22:22.742 --> 22:25.745
I'M GONNA TRY REALLY HARD
NOT TO LET MY LIFE

22:25.745 --> 22:28.618
MAKE YOUR LIFE
ANY MORE DIFFICULT.

22:28.618 --> 22:30.349
OKAY?

22:30.349 --> 22:31.821
I PROMISE.

22:31.821 --> 22:33.823
THANK YOU.

22:33.823 --> 22:37.056
SERIOUSLY, THANKS.

22:37.056 --> 22:40.490
UH, RYAN'S PICKING ME UP,

22:40.490 --> 22:41.731
SO I SHOULD...

22:41.731 --> 22:44.834
BYE.
BYE.

22:44.834 --> 22:48.798
OR, YOU KNOW, I COULD STAY HERE
AND HANG WITH YOU IF...
NO.

22:48.798 --> 22:50.600
YOU SURE?

22:50.600 --> 22:51.741
GO.

22:51.741 --> 22:54.143
HAVE FUN.

22:54.143 --> 22:57.547
(door opens)

22:57.547 --> 22:59.549
(door closes)

23:01.681 --> 23:03.513
(laughs)

23:03.513 --> 23:05.585
DRIVE.

23:07.016 --> 23:09.989
HE'S GONE!

23:13.162 --> 23:15.024
HUH?

23:15.024 --> 23:17.767
SO COOL.

23:17.767 --> 23:21.030
OKAY, TAKE THE WINE UPSTAIRS.
GET UNDRESSED.

23:21.030 --> 23:23.603
I WANT TO MAKE SURE
THE DOOR'S LOCKED.
DO YOU WANT THE LIGHTS
ON OR OFF?

23:23.603 --> 23:27.677
NO LIGHTS. I BOUGHT CANDLES.
MATTHEW, NO MORE TALKING.

23:27.677 --> 23:29.679
RIGHT. SORRY. SORRY.
