Did you guys see this?

00:33.960 --> 00:37.440
"Heroic local toucan
rescues baby bird from fall!"

00:38.519 --> 00:40.160
He looks like a superhero!

00:40.720 --> 00:43.320
It's so great to help others.

00:43.480 --> 00:45.120
That's what I wanna do today!

00:45.239 --> 00:46.559
Let's all do that today!

00:46.720 --> 00:48.400
How about we make a lemonade stand

00:48.559 --> 00:50.720
and give the money we earn
to a good cause?

00:50.879 --> 00:54.760
Good idea, but not what I had in mind.

00:55.239 --> 00:57.239
I wanna do something even bigger

00:57.400 --> 01:00.559
and be a superhero, like that toucan!

01:02.720 --> 01:05.119
I want to climb tall buildings.

01:06.640 --> 01:10.200
And fight my way through
the storm to the rescue!

01:12.039 --> 01:15.440
Plus I want to wear a cape
or a cool helmet. Bam!

01:15.800 --> 01:18.039
Zing! Kapow! Whoa!

01:19.479 --> 01:21.399
Ha, ha! You're funny, Moon!

01:21.600 --> 01:24.039
I'm not trying to be funny, Ollie.

01:24.399 --> 01:26.280
I'm trying to be a hero!

01:26.479 --> 01:29.839
I know a guy, Sven,
who gets to wear a cool helmet.

01:29.960 --> 01:32.600
He's a rescuer
in the mountains of Switzerland.

01:32.759 --> 01:36.000
Ooh! That sounds superheroey!

01:36.160 --> 01:38.280
-What does he do?
-Only the most daring

01:38.440 --> 01:40.320
and dangerous mountain rescues of all!

01:40.640 --> 01:42.320
Skiers trapped in snow storms.

01:42.440 --> 01:44.080
Hikers stranded on cliffs!

01:44.240 --> 01:47.039
Guys, I am having a brainstorm.

01:47.240 --> 01:51.240
Let's go to Switzerland
and be mountain rescuers!

01:51.360 --> 01:52.759
I'm in.

01:52.880 --> 01:55.360
-I love a good helmet.
-I don't know, Moon.

01:55.520 --> 01:57.559
I'm not really the heroic type.

01:57.720 --> 01:59.839
Oh, too bad.

02:00.039 --> 02:04.520
Especially since Switzerland
is the land of cheese fondue.

02:05.080 --> 02:09.039
You mean the yummy melted cheese
dish that you dip bread in?

02:09.199 --> 02:13.359
To Switzerland to be mountain rescuers!

02:19.760 --> 02:20.799
Whoo!

02:21.519 --> 02:22.959
Whee!

02:30.720 --> 02:36.120
<i>Now arriving in Switzerland,</i>
<i>home of the Swiss Alps.</i>

02:38.640 --> 02:41.760
[yodelling]

02:41.920 --> 02:43.920
There he is! There's Sven!

02:45.799 --> 02:49.040
-It's so great to see you!
-Stanley.

02:49.200 --> 02:51.400
These are my friends I told you about.

02:51.880 --> 02:53.760
Ollie. Moon.

02:54.000 --> 02:55.359
-Hi.
-Hello.

02:55.519 --> 02:59.400
We want to be mountain rescuers
and wear cool helmets!

02:59.560 --> 03:01.239
Well, some of us do.

03:01.480 --> 03:03.679
Others are in it more for the fondue.

03:06.320 --> 03:07.640
[sighs dreamily]

03:07.799 --> 03:09.280
This way.

03:09.440 --> 03:13.880
-Is he always this serious?
-Oh, yeah, always.

03:14.040 --> 03:15.640
Serious Sven is what they call him.

03:15.799 --> 03:18.359
I have never even seen him crack a smile!

03:19.079 --> 03:22.359
So, Sven, we're ready to superhero!

03:22.480 --> 03:23.840
Where do we get our helmets?

03:23.959 --> 03:27.480
I'm sorry, friends, but if you think
you can just walk in here

03:27.640 --> 03:30.120
and be mountain rescuers...

03:30.280 --> 03:31.760
We'd be right?

03:31.920 --> 03:35.600
We'd be not exactly right,
but not totally wrong either?

03:35.720 --> 03:38.040
We'd be really super-duper wrong?

03:38.399 --> 03:42.679
Mmm-hmm. Only the best and most
heroic can be mountain rescuers.

03:42.840 --> 03:44.160
Uh-huh! That's us. We're ready!

03:44.320 --> 03:46.920
So, first you will take some tests.

03:47.079 --> 03:50.000
-Tests?
-Yes! I love tests!

03:50.160 --> 03:54.359
A rescuer must be fit,
so the first test is a race.

03:54.519 --> 03:57.920
-Race?
-Yes! I love races!

04:00.720 --> 04:04.280
You must make it around
the course before I call time.

04:04.440 --> 04:05.679
-Great!
-Sounds fair.

04:05.839 --> 04:08.839
Uh, maybe I could take a test instead?

04:09.000 --> 04:11.560
Ready, set, go!

04:13.959 --> 04:16.399
Oof! Did I make it to the finish?

04:16.560 --> 04:17.839
Did I win?

04:18.120 --> 04:20.560
Come on, Ollie! We've got this!

04:20.719 --> 04:22.440
-Do we?
-This is so fun!

04:22.640 --> 04:24.640
Ah! Cold! Brr!

04:26.880 --> 04:29.039
We're going to be rescuers!

04:29.440 --> 04:30.680
Aaah! Wet!

04:31.000 --> 04:33.360
Supercats who help others!

04:33.840 --> 04:34.760
Huh?

04:34.920 --> 04:37.120
Ha, ha! Not this time.

04:39.479 --> 04:41.520
Aaah! Cold and wet!

04:41.680 --> 04:43.840
I can see the finish line! Huh?

04:44.200 --> 04:46.440
Is that... Stanley?

04:46.599 --> 04:48.240
Whoo! Go, Moon!

04:48.400 --> 04:49.840
You can do it, Ollie!

04:50.000 --> 04:51.400
[panting]

04:51.560 --> 04:53.200
[groans]

04:53.360 --> 04:55.400
Thanks for cheering us on, Stanley!

04:55.560 --> 04:57.360
-Did we pass?
-Yes.

04:57.640 --> 05:00.760
But, unfortunately, Stanley did not.

05:00.919 --> 05:03.640
That's cool! Snails aren't very speedy.

05:03.800 --> 05:06.280
Plus, I kind of like
cheering better anyway.

05:06.440 --> 05:08.039
Know what I mean, Sven?

05:08.200 --> 05:11.280
No. Let's move on to something different.

05:11.960 --> 05:15.680
Good, because I am ready
for some indoor time.

05:15.840 --> 05:19.479
There is nothing worse
than being cold and wet!

05:20.800 --> 05:22.000
Oh.

05:22.479 --> 05:25.159
-A skiing test.
-Except that.

05:25.280 --> 05:29.520
Mountain rescuers make most
of their rescues in the snow.

05:29.680 --> 05:31.919
So you must prove you're able to ski.

05:32.039 --> 05:33.240
But I'm scared of heights!

05:33.479 --> 05:35.440
Plus I've never skied before!

05:35.599 --> 05:37.960
Me neither, but it looks so fun!

05:38.159 --> 05:40.240
It's like having long, pointy feet.

05:40.400 --> 05:43.159
Who hasn't always wanted long,
pointy feet?

05:46.479 --> 05:50.000
Um, actually, you know
what's looking good right now?

05:50.120 --> 05:52.640
Lemonade stand. On the ground.

05:52.800 --> 05:54.840
The flat, flat ground.

05:54.960 --> 05:56.200
Come on, Ollie!

05:56.359 --> 05:57.719
If we want to help others,

05:57.919 --> 05:59.680
we have to do big stuff like this.

05:59.919 --> 06:01.719
I just know we can do it!

06:02.320 --> 06:03.640
Aaah!

06:04.120 --> 06:05.320
Gah!

06:05.760 --> 06:08.200
-Wait for me!
-Aaah!

06:09.120 --> 06:11.159
Go, Ollie! You can do it!

06:11.359 --> 06:13.599
Just follow the sound of my voice!

06:13.719 --> 06:14.800
Whoa! No!

06:18.359 --> 06:20.719
Whoo!

06:20.840 --> 06:21.719
Aaah!

06:22.760 --> 06:25.840
-I can't look!
-Go, kitty cats!

06:26.640 --> 06:29.919
-Moon, you pass.
-Yes!

06:30.080 --> 06:31.599
But... where's Ollie?

06:33.880 --> 06:38.120
Ollie, I'm sorry. You did not pass.

06:38.919 --> 06:41.680
You know what? I'm OK with that.
I'm not good with heights,

06:41.799 --> 06:43.039
or speed, or cold.

06:43.240 --> 06:48.799
But I like you.
So you may carry my clipboard.

06:48.919 --> 06:53.599
-Wow! It's so shiny!
-Yes, it is.

06:53.760 --> 06:58.359
Moon, one final test and
you can be a mountain rescuer.

06:58.520 --> 07:02.359
All right! What do I have to do?
Run, climb, leap, swing?

07:02.560 --> 07:07.039
Pretend this piece of chocolate
is a hiker lost in the snow.

07:08.960 --> 07:14.840
Now find it, using only
your sense of smell.

07:15.799 --> 07:17.599
[sniffs]

07:17.719 --> 07:20.640
-You can do it, Moon!
-Come on, Moon!

07:21.479 --> 07:24.960
-All I smell is snow.
-Take your time!

07:25.120 --> 07:28.719
You can do it! You da cat!

07:29.640 --> 07:32.599
-I can't smell it!
-Time's up.

07:32.760 --> 07:34.520
[sniffs]

07:35.440 --> 07:37.400
It was right here.

07:38.039 --> 07:40.159
My nose isn't sensitive like yours.

07:40.280 --> 07:44.080
I'm sorry, Moon, but you did not pass.

07:44.400 --> 07:46.520
So I can't be a mountain rescuer

07:46.680 --> 07:49.039
and make big superheroey saves?

07:49.200 --> 07:52.840
But... but... I want to help others!

07:53.000 --> 07:55.640
Nothing can stop you
from doing that, Moon!

07:55.799 --> 07:58.479
You don't have to be
a superhero to help others.

07:58.679 --> 08:00.440
There are lots of ways to do that!

08:00.719 --> 08:04.320
Yeah! Like, I'm not speedy,
but I'm a terrific cheerleader!

08:04.479 --> 08:07.280
-Whoo!
-He is pretty inspiring.

08:07.440 --> 08:10.560
And I'm no skier,
but I can organise anything.

08:10.719 --> 08:14.200
Here's your clipboard.
It's alphabetised and colour-coded

08:14.359 --> 08:16.719
to make rescuing easier for you.

08:16.880 --> 08:19.200
I don't say this very often, but...

08:19.320 --> 08:20.320
Wow!

08:20.640 --> 08:22.560
Thanks for trying to cheer me up,

08:22.719 --> 08:25.320
but if I can't be a mountain rescuer,

08:25.479 --> 08:27.880
then I don't want to do anything at all!

08:28.039 --> 08:29.039
Aaah!

08:29.200 --> 08:31.320
-Oh, no!
-Uh-oh!

08:31.479 --> 08:33.039
[laughs] Look at me!

08:33.240 --> 08:35.840
I'm an ice-cream sundae with sprinkles!

08:36.439 --> 08:38.000
Sven, toss me your helmet!

08:39.159 --> 08:40.319
With a cherry on top!

08:40.480 --> 08:43.360
-[hums]
-[Sven titters]

08:43.520 --> 08:46.360
-Who's hungry for ice cream?
-No way!

08:46.520 --> 08:49.040
Is Serious Sven... laughing?

08:49.280 --> 08:52.439
[giggles] Grab a shovel and dig in!

08:52.560 --> 08:55.199
[chuckles]

08:55.319 --> 08:57.840
Moon, you made Sven laugh.

08:58.000 --> 09:00.480
I've never, ever seen Sven laugh before!

09:01.800 --> 09:05.040
That's because... Ha, ha!
I haven't laughed

09:05.240 --> 09:10.880
since I became a super-serious
mountain rescuer. Ha, ha!

09:11.120 --> 09:14.240
And it feels so good! Ha, ha!

09:14.400 --> 09:17.360
-So I really helped you?
-Yes!

09:17.520 --> 09:22.240
It's the most amazing rescue
this mountain has ever seen!

09:22.400 --> 09:24.240
-[laughs]
-See, Moon?

09:24.439 --> 09:26.160
You helped Sven by being funny!

09:26.360 --> 09:29.360
I guess your sense of humour
is your best sense!

09:29.560 --> 09:33.199
Yeah! Come on, let's help Sven some more!

you could fondue...

10:14.400 --> 10:16.560
Mmm!

10:17.839 --> 10:20.920
You know what?
This gives me another great idea

10:21.079 --> 10:22.800
for helping others!

10:25.319 --> 10:26.400
Fondue!

Get your delicious cheesy Swiss fondue!

but I'm feeling pretty heroic right now.

10:39.079 --> 10:40.640
You said it, Moon.

10:40.800 --> 10:44.520
-Gimme an F-O-N!
-F-O-N!

10:44.720 --> 10:48.920
-Gimme a D-U-E!
-D-U-E!

10:49.079 --> 10:51.360
-What does that spell?
-Fondue!

10:51.520 --> 10:53.880
-What does that spell?
-Fondue!

10:54.240 --> 10:59.400
-What does that spell?
-Fondue!
