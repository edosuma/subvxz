Rachel was in the house.

00:05.207 --> 00:07.276
She saw the killer.

00:07.309 --> 00:08.844
How did you know
what was in there?

00:08.878 --> 00:10.379
I didn't exactly.

00:10.380 --> 00:12.249
Ted: But something else I learned
in prison, Charlie.

00:12.250 --> 00:14.986
You had to have something
hidden away.

00:14.987 --> 00:17.222
[Camera shutter clicks]

00:17.223 --> 00:20.226
The lead detective on the case
that sent you to prison for 12 years

00:20.227 --> 00:21.570
just turned up shot to death.

00:21.571 --> 00:23.348
I am going to be handling
this case personally.

00:27.427 --> 00:28.437
Of course.
I know who you are.

00:28.461 --> 00:29.829
Of course.

00:39.305 --> 00:42.842
Ted:
This is the work
of a crazy person.

00:42.875 --> 00:45.245
Now, knowing
what you went through,

00:45.278 --> 00:47.947
it would be crazy
if you didn't go crazy.

00:47.980 --> 00:50.550
But this, Charlie, this...

00:50.583 --> 00:52.252
Is crazy.

00:52.285 --> 00:55.521
The police report says
she was out of the house.

00:55.555 --> 00:59.392
Rachel Seybolt was there
the night of the murders.

00:59.425 --> 01:00.665
There's proof of that here, huh?

01:00.693 --> 01:04.664
She drew a picture
of the killer.

01:04.697 --> 01:07.733
She was in the house
the night of the killings, Ted.

01:07.767 --> 01:09.435
Her bed was unmade.

01:09.469 --> 01:12.505

An unmade bed?

The lead detective
from my trial, shot dead

01:18.411 --> 01:20.513
at the police station,
just after--

01:20.546 --> 01:23.949
just after I saw him arguing

01:23.983 --> 01:26.719
with the SWAT leader
from the Bank of LA shootout.

01:26.752 --> 01:28.354
Where all that money
went missing.

01:28.388 --> 01:30.456
Where all that money
went missing.

01:30.490 --> 01:33.859
That's actually a little scary.

01:35.561 --> 01:37.397
Okay, what are you
gonna do next?

01:37.430 --> 01:39.732
I am going to bring things
that are hidden

01:39.765 --> 01:41.834

Oh, it's just something
we used to say.

somewhere else.

placed her here.

Do you know that dead girl?

Do you like fruit?

03:33.394 --> 03:34.828
You cops are all alike.

03:34.862 --> 03:37.698
That's some kind
of pervy question, right?

03:37.731 --> 03:39.200
It's just,
you look hungry, and I--

03:39.233 --> 03:40.801
I have this bag
of oranges in here,

03:40.834 --> 03:42.536
so...

Go ahead. Here.

I do kind of like oranges.

Take it, it's--it's--
it's not pervy.

03:51.879 --> 03:53.714
It's--it's just an orange.

03:57.885 --> 04:00.321
Why'd you walk away
from us back there?

04:00.354 --> 04:01.889
What'd you expect?

04:01.922 --> 04:04.425
Come back to the crib,
find it crawling with cops.

04:04.458 --> 04:05.826
You'd walk away too.

04:05.859 --> 04:07.461
Only if I was guilty.

04:07.495 --> 04:09.730
Yeah, well,
cops don't usually give us

04:09.763 --> 04:11.399
the benefit of the doubt.

04:11.432 --> 04:13.243
I bet they don't usually
give you oranges, either.

04:13.267 --> 04:14.427
We ain't doin' nothing for you

04:14.435 --> 04:15.745
just because you
gave us an orange.

04:15.769 --> 04:17.371
How does that orange taste?

04:17.405 --> 04:19.840
Good, I guess.

04:19.873 --> 04:20.874
It's organic.

04:22.443 --> 04:23.644
I grew that orange myself.

04:23.677 --> 04:25.179
You grew this orange?

04:25.213 --> 04:27.481
Did you know the girl?

04:27.515 --> 04:29.383
Yeah.

she was your sister.

Well, not like blood.

04:40.461 --> 04:42.363
But on the street,
you were family?

04:42.396 --> 04:43.631
She turned up in the summer.

04:43.664 --> 04:46.534
Camped out with us
under the overpass at night.

04:46.567 --> 04:50.404
She played tunes
at Valley Foods.

04:50.438 --> 04:51.739
Some guy would give her food,

04:51.772 --> 04:53.741

bread sometimes.

04:53.774 --> 04:54.775
What guy?

04:54.808 --> 04:56.310
She didn't say.

04:56.344 --> 04:58.379
He gave her food and all
she did was play for him?

Look, that's all
she said she did.

Either way, the trail's
gonna die out quick

Well, we'll go
to the supermarket

on the door that you broke.

might have said about Ames.

06:26.934 --> 06:28.569
No, you're close to Crews now,

06:28.602 --> 06:30.338
and you're starting
to act like him.

06:30.371 --> 06:32.005
This has gone

06:32.039 --> 06:33.507
beyond the department, Dani.

06:33.541 --> 06:35.776
The trouble he's making
has to stop.

06:35.809 --> 06:37.778
They can't let it go on.

06:37.811 --> 06:39.613
Do you understand?

06:39.647 --> 06:41.815
Let me tell you
how it's gonna happen.

They're gonna find a fold
of coke in your locker,

06:46.420 --> 06:48.556
a bindle in your car.

06:48.589 --> 06:49.990
You'd do that to me?

06:50.023 --> 06:53.361
No, it's what I've been trying
to protect you from,

06:53.394 --> 06:56.597
but I don't know
how much longer I can do that.

07:03.737 --> 07:06.006
You want to talk about it?

07:06.039 --> 07:08.576
You keep swallowing stuff
like this,

07:08.609 --> 07:11.912
you're gonna end up
with an ulcer or worse.

07:11.945 --> 07:15.649
Okay, okay,
then let's work the case.

07:16.550 --> 07:18.051

I'm--I'm--I'm cool.

on the backside.

You carve it yourself?

07:42.543 --> 07:43.310
Yeah.

took my knife away.

Why'd she do that?

07:50.183 --> 07:53.821
Yeah, Reese, why'd you
take away my knife?

07:53.854 --> 07:56.123
I don't think now
is the time to talk about it.

07:56.156 --> 07:57.825
She's shy.
I'll tell you.

07:57.858 --> 08:00.694
I used it when I should have
been using my service weapon.

08:00.728 --> 08:02.496
I get forgetful
about things like that.

08:02.530 --> 08:03.497

08:03.531 --> 08:06.066
Yeah, it's what we call guns.

you ever see a girl named Josie?

08:12.072 --> 08:14.508
I don't know. Maybe.

08:14.542 --> 08:16.710
Um, did something happen to her?

08:16.744 --> 08:19.713
Yeah, she was murdered.

08:24.184 --> 08:25.819
You sure you don't know her?

08:27.621 --> 08:28.556
Were you friends with Josie?

08:28.589 --> 08:31.692
You need a good knife
to carve like that.

08:31.725 --> 08:33.060
Can we see your knife?

08:33.093 --> 08:34.728
It's not my knife.
Here.

08:34.762 --> 08:35.896
Whose knife is it?

08:35.929 --> 08:37.197
Ray: Nate?

08:37.230 --> 08:39.166
Look, I'm sorry,
I never saw her before.

08:39.199 --> 08:42.035
Come here.
Everything okay?

08:42.069 --> 08:43.537
We're fine, Dad.

08:43.571 --> 08:44.371
Detective Reese, LAPD.

This is my partner,
Detective Crews.

08:48.642 --> 08:49.910
No, sir, not at all.

some questions about a crime

around here all the time.

to stop harassing customers,

crapped-out guitar,

anymore, sir.

Couldn't have been
much older than Nate.

09:12.766 --> 09:15.869
Well, if you can think of
anything that might help at all.

09:19.239 --> 09:21.975
Anything at all.

09:22.009 --> 09:23.777
Sad, really.

No parents to take care of them.

09:27.715 --> 09:29.049
Yeah, it is.

All right, let's go.

09:33.521 --> 09:34.622
Thanks.

09:36.524 --> 09:38.526
What do you think?

09:38.559 --> 09:39.993
I think we need
to talk to that kid

09:40.027 --> 09:43.030
when his dad isn't around.

09:46.734 --> 09:47.668

09:47.701 --> 09:50.671

The manager at Valley Foods
who gave me his address

09:52.272 --> 09:55.075

ends at 5:00.

Uh, my--my dad's
not here.

10:00.714 --> 10:02.883
We're not here
to talk to your dad.

We do my work at night.

10:07.420 --> 10:09.823
Nate, was there something
you wanted to tell us earlier?

10:09.857 --> 10:11.701
Reese:
Something about Josie
that you couldn't say

10:11.725 --> 10:12.693
in front of your dad?

10:12.726 --> 10:14.261
I--I told you.

10:14.294 --> 10:15.696
I don't--
I don't know her.

10:15.729 --> 10:17.798
A person's board
probably says a lot

10:17.831 --> 10:19.633
about their personal style.

10:19.667 --> 10:22.536
Yeah, what does that say
about you, Nate?

10:22.570 --> 10:24.805
It--it's just a carving.

10:24.838 --> 10:25.639
Nice work, though.

10:25.673 --> 10:27.575
Took real time.
You did it yourself?

10:27.608 --> 10:30.110
You carve one like that
for anyone else?

10:30.143 --> 10:32.245
No?

10:32.279 --> 10:33.246
Oh.

10:33.280 --> 10:35.248
'Cause that dancing bear

10:35.282 --> 10:36.717
looks exactly like the one

10:36.750 --> 10:37.818

10:37.851 --> 10:38.819
I mean, almost like

10:38.852 --> 10:40.688
the same person carved them.

10:40.721 --> 10:42.022
I bet the lab could match them.

10:42.055 --> 10:43.190
Reese:
Mm-hmm.

10:43.223 --> 10:45.893
You seen the lab
they got down there, Nate?

10:45.926 --> 10:48.862
That lab can match
anything to anything.

10:48.896 --> 10:51.064
You fart, they'll bag it,
sample it,

10:51.098 --> 10:52.566
and peg it on you.

10:52.600 --> 10:54.668
Carving is easy.

10:54.702 --> 10:55.836
No, wait.

10:55.869 --> 10:58.706
Okay, yeah, Josie and I
were friends.

10:58.739 --> 11:00.340
What kind of friends?

11:00.373 --> 11:01.775
The kind with benefits?

11:01.809 --> 11:04.177
Kinda. We'd mess around
sometimes.

11:04.211 --> 11:05.713
Why'd you lie?

11:05.746 --> 11:07.715
Because I didn't want my dad
to find out.

11:07.748 --> 11:11.184
I'm not supposed to date.

11:11.218 --> 11:12.853
He says I'm too young.

11:12.886 --> 11:14.097
You're not gonna
tell him, are you?

11:14.121 --> 11:15.856
Not if we don't have to.

11:15.889 --> 11:18.025
Nate, can you tell us
where you were

11:18.058 --> 11:20.260
between 5:00 and 11:00
last night?

11:20.293 --> 11:22.630
I was working at the market,
breaking down boxes.

11:22.663 --> 11:23.744
I can show you my timecard.

11:23.764 --> 11:24.765
Mm-hmm.

11:26.800 --> 11:29.302
What kind of father
doesn't want his teenage son

11:29.336 --> 11:30.771
to show interest in girls?

11:30.804 --> 11:33.340
The kind with serious
control issues.

11:36.677 --> 11:37.978
What are you doing?

11:39.379 --> 11:41.114
What are you doing?

11:41.148 --> 11:42.716
Crews, get out of there!

11:44.785 --> 11:46.019
What are you doing?

11:46.053 --> 11:47.721
Bars on the window.

11:47.755 --> 11:51.859
Yeah, safety bars.
A lot of people have those.

11:51.892 --> 11:53.761
Padlocks.

11:53.794 --> 11:55.062
A lot of people have those too.

11:55.095 --> 11:57.297
Look, we weren't invited.

11:57.330 --> 11:59.767
Anything we find
will get thrown out in court.

12:02.202 --> 12:04.738
[Quietly]
That door is locked
from the outside.

12:04.772 --> 12:06.907
Do a lot of people
have those too?

12:09.209 --> 12:11.211
Reese, this is a cell.

12:17.094 --> 12:18.605
Nate, what's with the lock on
the outside of the bedroom door?

12:18.629 --> 12:19.797
I think you should leave.

12:19.830 --> 12:21.632
Reese:
And these locks
on the windows.

12:21.665 --> 12:22.633
That's the kind of stuff

12:22.666 --> 12:24.027
used to hold
someone captive, Nate.

12:24.034 --> 12:25.879
You know, Josie wasn't
killed where we found her.

12:25.903 --> 12:27.605
She was killed somewhere else.

12:27.638 --> 12:29.673
You think--

12:29.707 --> 12:31.074
no, no way.

12:31.108 --> 12:32.952
Josie and I hooked up,
but I didn't kill her, I swear.

12:32.976 --> 12:33.944
Reese: Yeah?

12:33.977 --> 12:35.613
Well, a couple hours ago,

12:35.646 --> 12:36.923
you swore that you
didn't know her, either.

12:36.947 --> 12:37.848
I told--I told you.

12:37.881 --> 12:39.950
I didn't want my dad
to find out. He'd freak.

12:39.983 --> 12:41.885
Whose knife did you use
on the carvings

12:41.919 --> 12:43.120
on your board, Nate?

12:43.153 --> 12:45.856
Was it your dad's knife?

12:45.889 --> 12:48.492
You should go, both of you.

12:48.526 --> 12:50.494
My dad doesn't like visitors.

12:50.528 --> 12:52.029
Nate, your dad isn't here
right now.

12:52.062 --> 12:53.697
This is just between us.

12:53.731 --> 12:56.667
But we can only keep it
between us

12:56.700 --> 12:58.836
if you help us to prove
you're innocent.

13:00.938 --> 13:03.674
We met at the market
a few months ago.

13:03.707 --> 13:04.708
She was cool.

13:04.742 --> 13:06.176
She said she'd teach me
some chords

13:06.209 --> 13:08.178
on the guitar.

13:08.211 --> 13:10.013
We started meeting
down at the reservoir,

13:10.047 --> 13:12.182
just playing tunes and talking.

13:12.215 --> 13:13.751
You and Josie have sex?

13:13.784 --> 13:16.920
No, we just made out and stuff.

13:16.954 --> 13:19.032
Was there anyone else she could
have been having sex with?

13:19.056 --> 13:20.924
I knew she was with other guys,

13:20.958 --> 13:23.026
but she wouldn't talk
about them in front of me.

13:23.060 --> 13:25.195
Crews:
But you knew who else
she was with.

13:25.228 --> 13:28.198
Because we always know,
don't we?

13:29.900 --> 13:32.102
There was this one dude,

13:32.135 --> 13:33.170
a trucker.

13:33.203 --> 13:34.605
He delivered bread
to the market,

13:34.638 --> 13:36.640
and Josie used to talk
to him sometimes.

13:36.674 --> 13:39.076
Now please leave.

13:39.109 --> 13:41.178
My dad doesn't like it
when people come in.

13:41.211 --> 13:44.014
What's with all the locks
in here, Nate?

13:44.047 --> 13:45.549
I'm not exactly sure

13:45.583 --> 13:47.150
what business that is of yours.

13:51.321 --> 13:53.290
Did you ask these two in, Nate?

13:53.323 --> 13:54.391
No, sir.

13:54.424 --> 13:56.344
I told them not to come in.
I told them to leave.

13:56.359 --> 13:59.697
Is that true?

13:59.730 --> 14:00.998
Did Nate ask you to leave?

14:01.031 --> 14:03.801
Yeah, he asked us to leave.

14:03.834 --> 14:06.036
So you're in here
without a warrant.

14:07.738 --> 14:09.973
Without any cause.

14:10.007 --> 14:12.009
You want to come out
of here with us now, Nate?

14:12.042 --> 14:15.713
You can tell them
the truth, son.

14:18.048 --> 14:19.817
I want you both to leave.

14:19.850 --> 14:20.718
I didn't want you

14:20.751 --> 14:23.020
in here to begin with,
and I asked you

14:23.053 --> 14:24.121
not to come in.

14:25.689 --> 14:28.225
Something you want to say to me?

14:28.258 --> 14:30.027
I know you.

14:30.060 --> 14:32.696
Yeah. We met today
at the store.

14:32.730 --> 14:34.131
It's good to see you.

14:34.164 --> 14:36.066
Now get the hell
out of my house.

14:36.099 --> 14:38.936
No, I mean, we never met,

14:38.969 --> 14:40.804
but I know you.

14:40.838 --> 14:42.640
What the hell
is he talking about?

14:42.673 --> 14:44.041
Crews, we should leave.

14:44.074 --> 14:46.710
I know you
because you're all alike.

14:46.744 --> 14:48.946
You've all got that look.

14:48.979 --> 14:51.949
You're a guard,

14:51.982 --> 14:53.083
aren't you, Ray?

14:53.116 --> 14:54.985
You are way out of bounds here.

14:55.018 --> 14:59.189
You like the keys,
don't you, Ray, and the locks?

14:59.222 --> 15:01.058
I know you.

15:04.294 --> 15:07.064
And I know
what you're afraid of.

15:10.167 --> 15:12.703
Crews, we are leaving.

15:14.204 --> 15:16.006
My name is Detective Crews.

15:16.039 --> 15:17.941
If you ever need it,
you call 911

15:17.975 --> 15:20.678
and you ask for Detective Crews.

15:32.155 --> 15:33.223
What the hell was that?

15:33.256 --> 15:34.858
That was a boy behind bars.

15:34.892 --> 15:37.027
No, that was a cop
out of control.

15:37.060 --> 15:38.361
We will call social services.

15:38.395 --> 15:40.030
We will get a search warrant.

15:40.063 --> 15:41.665
But you jus--

15:41.699 --> 15:44.167
look, I know you're under
a lot of pressure

15:44.201 --> 15:46.203
with this whole I.A.D. thing,
but you better

15:46.236 --> 15:48.271
buckle it up,
or you're gonna come loose.

15:52.976 --> 15:54.978
Sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

15:55.012 --> 15:56.813
Detective, this meeting
has been set for days.

15:56.814 --> 15:58.782
There's no excuse
for you to be late.

15:58.816 --> 16:02.219
Probably hard
for you to understand,

16:02.252 --> 16:03.429
seeing what you do,
but I've just been out there,

16:03.453 --> 16:04.822
trying to stop crime.

16:04.855 --> 16:06.232
Detective, why don't you
come on over here

16:06.256 --> 16:07.657
and sit by me?

16:10.794 --> 16:12.963
Second interview
with Detective Crews

16:12.996 --> 16:15.198
concerning the murder
of Detective Carl Ames, retired.

16:15.232 --> 16:17.768
Present, Judith Raitt, I.A.D.,

16:17.801 --> 16:19.236
John Garrity, Detective's Union,

16:19.269 --> 16:21.238
and Detective Charles Crews.

16:21.271 --> 16:22.806
No one calls me Charles.

16:22.840 --> 16:25.876
And before we start,
I'd just like to say,

16:25.909 --> 16:27.244
it was real nice of you

16:27.277 --> 16:28.245
to stop by my house
the other day.

16:28.278 --> 16:29.246
Maybe someday

16:29.279 --> 16:30.489
you'll have me
over to your place.

16:30.513 --> 16:32.249
I'd like to know why,

16:32.282 --> 16:33.951
considering the size
of your settlement,

16:33.984 --> 16:35.786
you decided
to return to the force.

16:35.819 --> 16:37.054
Because I'm a good cop.

16:37.087 --> 16:39.056
Don't you think the city
needs good cops?

16:39.089 --> 16:40.257
I'd like to know if you're

16:40.290 --> 16:42.926
conducting an independent
and unauthorized investigation

16:42.960 --> 16:45.095
into the circumstances
of your arrest

16:45.128 --> 16:46.163
and imprisonment.

16:46.196 --> 16:47.236
See the way she does that?

16:47.264 --> 16:50.467
She's like a laser.
She--rrarr--locks right in.

16:50.500 --> 16:52.140
Stop wasting time
and answer her question.

16:52.169 --> 16:54.237
Are you or are you not

16:54.271 --> 16:56.173
conducting
an independent investigation?

16:56.206 --> 16:57.207
I investigate things.

16:57.240 --> 16:58.508
What kind of things?

16:58.541 --> 17:01.111
I investigate things
to complete my knowledge.

17:01.144 --> 17:04.214
My complete knowledge
makes my thoughts sincere.

17:04.247 --> 17:06.183
My thoughts being sincere,

17:06.216 --> 17:07.851
my heart is pure.

17:07.885 --> 17:08.886
Here we go.

17:08.919 --> 17:10.754
Reader's Digest?

17:10.788 --> 17:12.790
That's Confucius.

17:12.823 --> 17:14.357
It's good, though, isn't it?

17:14.391 --> 17:15.793
Yeah.

17:15.826 --> 17:17.761
Don't you want a pure heart?
I know I do.

17:17.795 --> 17:19.396
Detective, is it your intention

17:19.429 --> 17:21.331
not to cooperate
with this investigation?

17:21.364 --> 17:25.268
I investigate things.

17:25.302 --> 17:28.338
[Indistinct arguing]

17:30.908 --> 17:34.211
You do so have a talent
for mayhem.

17:34.244 --> 17:36.513
Sunday best?

17:36.546 --> 17:38.816
Nothing but for I.A.D.

17:38.849 --> 17:40.450
If I'd known you were on deck,

17:40.483 --> 17:42.285
I wouldn't have gotten them
so riled up.

17:42.319 --> 17:44.254
Hmm.

17:44.287 --> 17:45.355
You okay, Bobby?

17:47.825 --> 17:49.292
What should I tell them,
Charlie?

17:49.326 --> 17:51.361
Tell them the truth.

17:51.394 --> 17:52.129
That's what I did 12 years ago.

17:52.162 --> 17:54.197
That didn't turn out
so well, huh?

17:56.233 --> 17:59.502
Hey, got a line on that trucker
Nate told us about.

17:59.536 --> 18:00.804
Dean Gill.

18:00.838 --> 18:02.172
The bread delivery guy.

18:02.205 --> 18:03.974
You want to get some work done,

18:04.007 --> 18:05.351
maybe we can go lean on him,
see what happens.

18:05.375 --> 18:07.878
"Maybe we can go
lean on him." Whoo!

18:07.911 --> 18:09.479
My wife talked like that.

18:09.512 --> 18:12.449
Gotta lay off those
little blue pills.

18:14.384 --> 18:17.320
Dean Gill's employer
said he hadn't been to work

18:17.354 --> 18:19.356
in three days, and...
Wait for it.

18:19.389 --> 18:21.358
His truck is missing.

18:28.966 --> 18:31.401
[Screaming]

18:42.612 --> 18:44.114
Reese: Cats.

18:44.147 --> 18:46.016
I hate cats.

18:46.049 --> 18:47.951
Actually, I think
they're kittens.

18:47.985 --> 18:49.319
Well, I hate them too.

18:49.352 --> 18:53.123
[Mewing]

18:53.156 --> 18:54.257
What are you doing in here?

18:54.291 --> 18:55.558
Are you Dean Gill?

18:55.592 --> 18:57.127
Yeah, yeah.

18:57.160 --> 18:58.561
Close the door,

18:58.595 --> 19:00.163
'cause I don't

19:00.197 --> 19:01.598
want my little ones
to wander off.

19:03.200 --> 19:04.601
You broke my door in.

19:04.634 --> 19:06.203
We heard screaming.

19:07.337 --> 19:08.405
We thought we...

19:09.406 --> 19:11.408
We thought we heard screaming.

19:11.441 --> 19:12.642
Well, it wasn't screaming.

19:12.675 --> 19:15.545
It was my little ones.

19:15.578 --> 19:17.447
Can't smell them, though,
can you?

19:17.480 --> 19:21.584
36 I have, and it's fresh
as a Daisy in here.

19:21.618 --> 19:24.021
Now I'd like you
to please leave,

19:24.054 --> 19:27.324
as owning kittens
is not a crime.

19:27.357 --> 19:30.027
Crews:
Your boss reported
his truck stolen,

19:30.060 --> 19:31.594
Dean, and yet, here it is,

19:31.628 --> 19:32.629
in your backyard.

19:35.332 --> 19:37.534
I don't understand
why he reported it stolen.

19:37.567 --> 19:39.369
I take it home
every once in a while.

19:39.402 --> 19:41.438
And you park it back here?

19:41.471 --> 19:43.941
We have a lot of vandals
in this part of town.

19:43.974 --> 19:45.208
They like to mess with my rig.

19:45.242 --> 19:46.509
You know a girl named Josie?

19:46.543 --> 19:48.178
Mm-mm.

19:48.211 --> 19:51.181
And this is the truck
used to deliver bread

19:51.214 --> 19:52.015
to Valley Foods?

19:52.049 --> 19:53.683
Been making the drop
at Valley Foods

19:53.716 --> 19:55.418
same time every day
for the last year.

19:55.452 --> 19:57.320
You never saw a girl
named Josie?

19:57.354 --> 20:00.123
If I did, she didn't make
much of an impact.

20:00.157 --> 20:01.491
Is she in some kind of trouble?

20:01.524 --> 20:03.260
Yeah, she's dead.

20:05.128 --> 20:08.098
Man, that's rough.

20:08.131 --> 20:09.332
I read about stuff

20:09.366 --> 20:10.367
like that, but...

20:10.400 --> 20:11.234
Man.

20:11.268 --> 20:14.037
Mind if we take
a look in your rig?

20:14.071 --> 20:15.572
No. Go to town.

20:15.605 --> 20:17.040
It looks clean.

20:17.074 --> 20:18.608
Like it's been washed.

20:18.641 --> 20:20.543
Dean:
That's why I bring it home.

20:20.577 --> 20:23.113
The yeast builds up.
You get an awful stink.

20:27.550 --> 20:28.551
We all good?

20:31.989 --> 20:33.991
You play guitar, do you?

20:46.433 --> 20:47.835
I need to use the hopper.

20:47.868 --> 20:49.169
Hold it.

21:26.440 --> 21:27.742
You know where I found those?

21:27.775 --> 21:29.744
With your morning paper?

21:29.777 --> 21:31.011
That's a good guess.

21:31.045 --> 21:33.080
No guessing.
I put them there.

21:33.113 --> 21:34.958
You want to tell us how
you came by these pictures?

21:34.982 --> 21:37.017
Oh, I think
he's about to do that.

21:37.051 --> 21:38.418
Aren't you, Detective Crews?

21:38.452 --> 21:40.955
Yeah, I took 'em.

21:40.988 --> 21:43.157
I was seen with Ames,
you know that.

21:43.190 --> 21:44.801
That's why you organized
that little gathering

21:44.825 --> 21:46.060
at my house the other day.

21:46.093 --> 21:47.995
That's why you're digging
into my life.

21:48.028 --> 21:49.029
You dig a little deeper,

21:49.063 --> 21:50.731
you will find
I did not kill Ames.

21:50.765 --> 21:52.132
Is that what we'll find?

21:52.166 --> 21:55.002
We? That's what
the police will find.

21:55.035 --> 21:57.104
You're retired, right, Jack?

21:57.137 --> 21:58.773
Yeah, that's right.

21:58.806 --> 22:01.141
Me, I'm still on the job,
so I'm curious,

22:01.175 --> 22:03.110
as a homicide detective,

22:03.143 --> 22:05.512
when someone
is gonna question you

22:05.545 --> 22:06.646
for Ames' death.

22:06.680 --> 22:09.850
Because, and I'm sorry if
I'm using the wrong tone here,

22:09.884 --> 22:11.752
but those photos look a lot

22:11.786 --> 22:13.420
like you are
in a violent disagreement

22:13.453 --> 22:14.521
with the late Carl Ames.

22:14.554 --> 22:17.057
Detective Crews,
the Ames investigation

22:17.091 --> 22:18.358
is none of your concern.

22:18.392 --> 22:19.359
Jack: It's okay, Karen.

22:19.393 --> 22:21.328
I argued with Carl last week,

22:21.361 --> 22:23.330
the week before that,
and the week before that.

22:23.363 --> 22:26.200
We argued about football.

22:26.233 --> 22:28.735
We were friends.

22:38.545 --> 22:40.547
Nice.

22:40.580 --> 22:41.816
That mouth of yours

22:41.849 --> 22:42.969
ever get you in any trouble?

22:46.553 --> 22:48.923
Okay, detective,
lay out your case.

22:48.956 --> 22:50.090
My case?

22:50.124 --> 22:51.558
Yeah,
you're a homicide detective.

22:51.591 --> 22:52.969
You're making a case.
Lay it out for me.

22:52.993 --> 22:55.930
Lay it out, then maybe
I'll let you know

22:55.963 --> 22:58.498
whether or not you'll end up
back in federal prison

22:58.532 --> 23:00.467
or in the county morgue.

23:00.500 --> 23:04.905
The Seybolt girl
was in that house

23:04.939 --> 23:06.807
the night her family
was murdered.

23:06.841 --> 23:08.508
Ames changed the police report,

23:08.542 --> 23:09.543
said she wasn't there.

23:09.576 --> 23:11.578
Ames took her out of that house.

23:11.611 --> 23:13.413
And you went to Ames with this?

23:13.447 --> 23:17.151
I did, and then
I followed him to you.

23:17.184 --> 23:19.586
Let's leave me out of this
for the moment.

23:19.619 --> 23:22.456
Stick with Ames
and the girl, Rachel.

23:22.489 --> 23:24.258
She saw the killer.

23:24.291 --> 23:25.893
And you know this how?

23:25.926 --> 23:27.427
She drew a sketch of him.

23:27.461 --> 23:28.428
You have this sketch?

23:28.462 --> 23:29.830
I do.

23:29.864 --> 23:31.165
Did you come by it legally?

23:31.198 --> 23:34.334
Rachel saw the killer.

23:34.368 --> 23:36.403
I went to Ames with that.

23:36.436 --> 23:37.471
Ames went to you.

23:37.504 --> 23:39.806
And now Ames is dead.

23:47.347 --> 23:48.524
Son, you keep going
where you're going,

23:48.548 --> 23:50.084
and you're gonna find trouble

23:50.117 --> 23:52.019
whether it was there
to begin with or not.

23:52.052 --> 23:55.222
And you would do well
to keep my daughter out of it.

23:59.927 --> 24:00.627
Where are you going?

24:00.660 --> 24:03.530
I have a witness to interrogate.

24:03.563 --> 24:06.901
Dean:
Dapper Dan, Mr. Plithers,
Bonkers,

24:06.934 --> 24:09.503
Kitty bin Laden--
he's sort of psycho.

24:09.536 --> 24:11.405
Names of his kittens.

24:11.438 --> 24:12.907
Past and present.

24:12.940 --> 24:13.941
You have a nice talk?

24:13.974 --> 24:16.911
No, not really.

24:16.944 --> 24:18.879
Am I supposed
to understand this?

24:18.913 --> 24:20.915
Do you want to know
what he wanted?

24:20.948 --> 24:22.058
He always wants the same thing.

24:22.082 --> 24:23.383
Yeah, what is that?

24:23.417 --> 24:25.552
Everyone else's unhappiness.

24:25.585 --> 24:28.488
Is this some sort
of good cop/bad cop?

24:28.522 --> 24:30.324
Because it ain't working on me.

24:30.357 --> 24:31.992
Did you ask him about Josie?

24:32.026 --> 24:34.528
I have no kitten named Josie.

24:34.561 --> 24:35.529
Josie the dead girl.

24:35.562 --> 24:37.364
Why do you have so many kittens?

24:37.397 --> 24:40.200
I like the way they sing.

24:40.234 --> 24:42.236
Reese:
We found semen
in the dead girl.

24:42.269 --> 24:44.371
She give you sex for food?

24:44.404 --> 24:46.673
Semen?

24:46.706 --> 24:48.475
It's not mine.

24:49.944 --> 24:53.147
I don't copulate, detective.

24:53.180 --> 24:54.414
Ever?

24:54.448 --> 24:56.083
Ever.

24:56.116 --> 24:59.987
I do, however,
need to move my bowels,

25:00.020 --> 25:01.355
which I've told you already.

25:01.388 --> 25:03.490
You know what happens
when we find that guitar pick,

25:03.523 --> 25:04.491
don't you, Dean?

25:04.524 --> 25:05.459
You'll get your hands dirty?

25:05.492 --> 25:12.199
We pull Josie's DNA off it
and put you in jail.

25:16.003 --> 25:18.939
She was in my truck.

25:18.973 --> 25:22.609
She used to play for me
and sing.

25:22.642 --> 25:25.012
Her music was very vivid,

25:25.045 --> 25:27.214
almost as vivid as Claudius,

25:27.247 --> 25:29.183
Gustav, and Raritan the Lesser.

25:29.216 --> 25:34.721
But if you're looking
to me for her murder,

25:34.754 --> 25:37.391
you're looking the wrong way.

25:42.029 --> 25:45.432
I.A.D. says you stay on duty,
so you stay on duty.

25:47.667 --> 25:50.137
You want to request
a new partner?

25:53.373 --> 25:55.209
No, ma'am.

25:58.078 --> 26:00.414
Then I need you working.

26:00.447 --> 26:02.325
The search warrant came through
for the Hastings house.

26:02.349 --> 26:04.484
Children's services
will meet you there.

26:04.518 --> 26:06.286
If your boy Dean in there
didn't kill Josie,

26:06.320 --> 26:08.155
maybe the skateboard kid
or his dad did it.

26:08.188 --> 26:09.723
Either way, the kid's in danger.

26:16.063 --> 26:18.465
[Sighs]

26:29.409 --> 26:32.412
Crews:
They cleared out
the apartment and fled.

26:36.616 --> 26:38.685
Reese: All right, thanks.

26:38.718 --> 26:42.089
I've got BOLO
and Amber Alerts wide.

26:42.122 --> 26:45.592
We'll find them.

26:48.528 --> 26:51.131
You think the dad killed Josie

26:51.165 --> 26:52.175
and took the kid on the run,

26:52.199 --> 26:56.036
or did the kid kill Josie

26:56.070 --> 26:59.339
and the dad took him on the run,

26:59.373 --> 27:01.108
or did Ray and Nate
do it together,

27:01.141 --> 27:02.176
father and son?

27:07.214 --> 27:09.583
Can you imagine
living like this?

27:09.616 --> 27:11.485
Don't have to.

27:11.518 --> 27:12.652
Right.

27:12.686 --> 27:14.121
Because of
the whole prison thing.

27:14.154 --> 27:16.423
Yeah, copy that.

27:16.456 --> 27:18.592
About your dad...

27:18.625 --> 27:23.130
Yeah. Let me make this
easy on you.

27:23.163 --> 27:24.831
I spent my childhood
trying to figure out

27:24.864 --> 27:27.134
if my dad was only mean

27:27.167 --> 27:31.171
or just plain bad.

27:31.205 --> 27:32.339
And you,

27:32.372 --> 27:34.174
I don't really understand you.

27:34.208 --> 27:38.078
I don't really like you, but...

27:38.112 --> 27:40.714
You're not one of the bad guys.

27:42.649 --> 27:44.784
If I had your money,

27:44.818 --> 27:47.521
I'd be on a beach somewhere.

27:47.554 --> 27:51.591
How come you're not
on a beach somewhere?

27:51.625 --> 27:55.595
Do I look like I tan?

27:55.629 --> 27:57.864
[Laughs softly]

27:57.897 --> 28:02.402
The things people do
with their kids.

28:02.436 --> 28:04.438
Parents and children.

28:04.471 --> 28:09.309
Cats and kittens.

28:09.343 --> 28:11.711
Where were all the cats?

28:11.745 --> 28:13.180
What cats?

28:13.213 --> 28:14.314
At Dean Gill's.

28:14.348 --> 28:16.350
All those kittens,
but where were the cats?

28:24.190 --> 28:27.326
[Police radio chatter]
Cats, lots of them.

28:27.360 --> 28:28.862
And their throats?

28:28.895 --> 28:31.497
Hard to tell, but it looks
like they've been cut.

28:31.530 --> 28:33.599
[Camera shutter clicks]

28:33.632 --> 28:37.536
Looks like you kept more than
that truck in your backyard.

28:37.570 --> 28:39.472
Tomorrow around this time,

28:39.505 --> 28:42.842
we're gonna get
those lab tests back, Deanie.

28:42.876 --> 28:45.111
My mother called me Deanie.

28:45.144 --> 28:46.913
I'd appreciate it
if you did not.

28:46.946 --> 28:48.982
Sure thing.

28:49.015 --> 28:51.217
We're gonna get
those lab tests back

28:51.250 --> 28:53.953
and it's not gonna be
good news for you, Dean.

28:53.987 --> 28:57.156
I fart, that lab
can put it in a bag

28:57.190 --> 28:58.357
and peg it back to me.

28:58.391 --> 28:59.525
Did you fart?

28:59.558 --> 29:01.227
Reese:
First you did it
to the cats,

29:01.260 --> 29:02.261
then you did it to Josie.

29:02.295 --> 29:03.429
What, were you practicing?

29:03.462 --> 29:05.064
Just getting warmed up?

29:05.098 --> 29:06.599
Didn't.

29:06.632 --> 29:07.533
Didn't do anything.

29:07.566 --> 29:10.103
That's not what
the lab tests are gonna say.

29:10.136 --> 29:12.038
He wants something, Reese.

29:12.071 --> 29:13.606
Don't you, Dean?

29:13.639 --> 29:16.542
You wanted something
and you took it,

29:16.575 --> 29:19.946
first from the cats
and then from Josie.

29:19.979 --> 29:21.414
Isn't that right?

29:21.447 --> 29:23.049
Reese:
Okay, here's how
it's gonna work.

29:23.082 --> 29:24.617
The lab's gonna call us up,

29:24.650 --> 29:26.495
say that they matched
those serrations on the cats

29:26.519 --> 29:27.887
to the one on Josie.

29:27.921 --> 29:29.355
You remember Josie, don't you?

29:29.388 --> 29:31.090
The murdered girl?

29:31.124 --> 29:33.492
The girl that used to have
the beautiful voice.

29:33.526 --> 29:35.628
You liked that voice.

29:35.661 --> 29:37.630
Why'd you do that to her, Dean?

29:37.663 --> 29:38.908
You wanted something
and you took it,

29:38.932 --> 29:39.966
didn't you, Dean?

29:39.999 --> 29:41.600
Didn't.
Didn't do anything.

29:43.502 --> 29:47.974
What happens to kittens
when they turn into cats?

29:48.007 --> 29:50.543
What happens to little girls

29:50.576 --> 29:52.545
when they turn into women?

29:52.578 --> 29:55.614
What happens to their voice

29:55.648 --> 29:58.584
just as they grow up?

30:00.553 --> 30:04.657
What happened to you, Deanie,
just as you grew up?

30:04.690 --> 30:06.192
Okay.

30:06.225 --> 30:07.660
Deal time.

30:07.693 --> 30:09.062
You cop to it right now,

30:09.095 --> 30:11.597
and we don't ask
for special circumstances.

30:11.630 --> 30:14.067
That means we don't file
the death papers,

30:14.100 --> 30:15.568
and you avoid the gurney.

30:18.271 --> 30:20.606
But you gotta go
right now or--

30:20.639 --> 30:22.942
or we walk out that door.

30:32.651 --> 30:34.520
[Door opens]

30:34.553 --> 30:36.222
I took out her voice.

30:42.628 --> 30:47.733
I--I--I just wanted
her voice,

30:47.766 --> 30:50.536
so I--I took it.

30:55.774 --> 30:57.310
If Nate and Ray didn't do it,

30:57.343 --> 30:58.544
why did they run?

30:58.577 --> 31:00.613
Why does anyone run
from anything?

31:00.646 --> 31:02.448
'Cause they're guilty.

31:02.481 --> 31:03.616
Where's Nate's mother?

31:03.649 --> 31:05.718
You think this
is a custody beef?

31:05.751 --> 31:07.720
Father takes the kid,

31:07.753 --> 31:09.022
we stumble on them,

31:09.055 --> 31:10.589
and they have to go on the run.

31:10.623 --> 31:13.092
Let's track down the mother.

31:19.532 --> 31:21.367
How is this possible?

31:21.400 --> 31:24.170
There's no record of Nate
having a mother.

31:24.203 --> 31:25.971
See if there's a record of Nate.

31:30.343 --> 31:32.111
They're not father and son.

31:32.145 --> 31:33.112
We thought it might
be a custody thing,

31:33.146 --> 31:34.146
that that's why they ran.

31:34.147 --> 31:35.648
Dad takes kid away from mom.

31:35.681 --> 31:36.849
Happens all the time.

31:36.882 --> 31:39.052
Reese:
So we try
to locate the mom.

31:39.085 --> 31:40.119
There isn't one.

31:40.153 --> 31:41.420
Never was one.
