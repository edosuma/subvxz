WEBVTT

00:04.605 --> 00:05.873
BABE, WHAT ARE YOU
DOIN'?

00:05.906 --> 00:08.142
YOU SAID YOUR FRIEND DAVE
WAS COMIN' FOR DINNER.
THIS IS DINNER.

00:08.176 --> 00:10.711
SAUSAGE. BABY, WE CAN'T
FEED DAVE SAUSAGE.

00:10.744 --> 00:11.912
SEAN, THE MAN LIVED
IN A SUBWAY TUNNEL.

00:11.945 --> 00:14.548
HE'LL BE HAPPY
TO HAVE A MEAL THAT
DOESN'T CRAWL PAST HIM.

00:14.582 --> 00:18.352
OK, HE DIDN'T
LIVE IN THE SUBWAY.
HE PERFORMED THERE.

00:18.386 --> 00:19.287
AND THAT WAS 10 YEARS AGO.

00:19.320 --> 00:21.355
HE'S ABOVE GROUND.
HE'S A BIG CELEBRITY NOW.

00:21.389 --> 00:24.758
HE'S A CHILDREN'S
HEALTH PERFORMER.

00:24.792 --> 00:27.228
HE'S NOT JUST ANY
CHILDREN'S HEALTH PERFORMER.

00:27.261 --> 00:28.262
HE'S J.J. BODYBUDDY.

00:28.296 --> 00:30.498
HE'S GOT A LINE OF
EDUCATIONAL BOOKS
AND VIDEOS.

00:30.531 --> 00:33.367
SEAN. THE MAN
DANCES AROUND IN A SUIT
OF INTERNAL ORGANS.

00:33.401 --> 00:36.237
YEAH, HE DOES VERY WELL
FOR HIMSELF. DON'T MOCK IT.

00:36.270 --> 00:38.206
I'M NOT MOCKIN'. IT JUST
SOUNDS LIKE I'M MOCKING

00:38.239 --> 00:41.509
'CAUSE HE DANCES AROUND IN
A SUIT OF INTERNAL ORGANS.

00:41.542 --> 00:42.476
HEY, DAD.

00:42.510 --> 00:47.281
LILY, HI. WHAT ARE...
HEY, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

00:47.315 --> 00:49.283
ASK YOUR WIFE.

00:49.317 --> 00:51.252
UH, WIFE,
WHAT IS SHE DOING?

00:51.285 --> 00:54.655
LILY KIND OF FOUND OUT
WHERE WE'RE PLANNING
ON PUTTING THE BABY.

00:54.688 --> 00:56.824
MOM, WHAT ARE YOU DOING
IN MY ROOM?

00:56.857 --> 00:59.793
I WAS LOOKIN' FOR THE CRIB.
WELL, THERE IT IS.

00:59.827 --> 01:00.494
HA HA HA HA.

01:00.528 --> 01:03.131
WHY IS THERE
A CRIB IN MY ROOM?

01:03.164 --> 01:05.599
OK, LOOK, YOUR DAD AND I
WERE JUST THINKING

01:05.633 --> 01:07.801
THAT NEXT YEAR, SINCE YOU'RE
GONNA GO TO COLLEGE

01:07.835 --> 01:09.803
AND WE DON'T HAVE
ANY EXTRA ROOMS,

01:09.837 --> 01:10.971
WE WOULD USE THIS ROOM
AS THE BABY'S ROOM.

01:11.004 --> 01:14.842
WELL, WHAT ABOUT
WHEN I COME HOME
FROM COLLEGE ON BREAKS?

01:14.875 --> 01:17.311
I'M NOT SHARING MY ROOM
WITH A BABY.

01:17.345 --> 01:21.249
DO YOU KNOW HOW MUCH
BABIES SCREAM!

01:21.282 --> 01:22.450
I HAVE SOME IDEA, YEAH.

01:22.483 --> 01:25.186
UH, YOU KNOW, WE'LL
FIGURE SOMETHIN' OUT.

01:25.219 --> 01:27.155
WE'LL SET UP A PLACE FOR YOU
IN THE BASEMENT OR SOMETHING.

01:27.188 --> 01:31.625
I'M NOT SLEEPING
IN THAT COLD, DAMP,
SPIDER-INFESTED PIT.

01:31.659 --> 01:34.228
PUT THE BABY DOWN THERE.

01:34.262 --> 01:35.062
LILY, BE REASONABLE.

01:35.095 --> 01:38.299
OH, YOU JUST
LOVE THE BABY,
DON'T YA?

01:39.333 --> 01:41.135
SHE'S JUST
BEING DRAMATIC.

01:41.169 --> 01:44.438
LIL--LILY...

01:44.705 --> 01:47.308
HEY, LILY, CUT IT OUT!

01:47.708 --> 01:49.042
I'M JUST HELPIN' OUT MOM.

01:49.076 --> 01:52.280
OK,
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO CALM DOWN.
THIS IS NOT YOUR MOTHER'S FAULT.

01:52.313 --> 01:56.617
OH, I KNOW. THIS NEVER
WOULD'VE HAPPENED IF YOU
WEREN'T SUCH A HORN DOG.

01:56.650 --> 01:57.685
GO TO YOUR ROOM!

01:57.718 --> 01:58.752
I DON'T HAVE ONE!

01:58.786 --> 02:00.721
THEN GO
TO THE BABY'S ROOM.

02:00.754 --> 02:02.856
AAH!

02:04.425 --> 02:06.294
DAVE.

02:09.330 --> 02:11.399
DAVE! MAN!

02:11.432 --> 02:12.666
HEY, SEAN.

02:12.700 --> 02:13.767
COME HERE.

02:13.801 --> 02:14.502
HEY.

02:14.535 --> 02:16.570
GOD, YOU LOOK GREAT.

02:16.604 --> 02:18.239
OH, THANKS.
IT TOOK A LOT OF WORK.

02:18.272 --> 02:20.208
WOW, IT'S SO CRAZY
TO THINK OF YOU

02:20.241 --> 02:22.210
AS A CHILDREN'S
HEALTH PERFORMER.
I MEAN,

02:22.243 --> 02:23.811
BACK IN THE DAY,
YOU INVENTED
THAT DRINKING GAME

02:23.844 --> 02:28.382
WHERE--WHERE--
WHERE YOU HAD TO DRINK
EVERY TIME SOMEONE DRANK.

02:28.582 --> 02:31.885
OH, ED, YOU REMEMBER
MY BUDDY DAVE?

02:31.919 --> 02:33.754
YEAH, SEAN'S FRIEND
FROM THE SUBWAY.

02:33.787 --> 02:34.855
I'M NOT IN THE SUBWAY
ANYMORE.

02:34.888 --> 02:36.890
NO, NO. HE'S A CHILDREN'S
PERFORMER NOW.

02:36.924 --> 02:40.261
OH, NO OFFENSE, BUT
CHILDREN'S PERFORMERS
REALLY FREAK ME OUT.

02:40.294 --> 02:43.931
NO, HE DOES THIS THING WHERE
HE WEARS A SPANDEX SUIT

02:43.964 --> 02:45.766
WITH THE ORGANS
ON THE OUTSIDE OF IT.

02:45.799 --> 02:47.635
THAT'S NOT HELPING.

02:47.668 --> 02:49.703
COME ON, HAVE A SEAT, MAN.

02:49.737 --> 02:52.406
WELL, IT'S GREAT
TO SEE YOU, SEAN.

02:52.440 --> 02:55.543
I GOTTA SAY,
I'M REALLY SURPRISED
TO GET YOUR CALL.

02:55.576 --> 02:58.312
OH, GOD, IT'S BEEN
TOO LONG. YOU KNOW,

02:58.346 --> 03:00.881
I FIGURED
WE SHOULD CATCH UP.

03:00.914 --> 03:02.850
WELL, MY LIFE HAS CHANGED--

03:02.883 --> 03:04.585
I GOTTA ASK YOU A FAVOR.

03:04.618 --> 03:05.786
AND WE NEED A VOLUNTEER

03:05.819 --> 03:10.424
TO HEAD THE FOOD AND BEVERAGE
COMMITTEE FOR THE HEALTH FAIR.

03:10.891 --> 03:15.363
SOMEONE WHO HASN'T
VOLUNTEERED FOR ANYTHING.

03:15.396 --> 03:17.331
EVER.

03:19.433 --> 03:20.601
I'LL DO THAT, TOO.

03:20.634 --> 03:24.305
THANK YOU, MRS. BENNETT. NOW,
I THINK THAT TAKES CARE OF IT.

03:24.338 --> 03:27.408
OK, ANOTHER PRODUCTIVE
MEETING, HUH, FOLKS?

03:27.441 --> 03:31.412
WE NEED SOMEONE TO HEAD
THE ENTERTAINMENT COMMITTEE.

03:32.980 --> 03:34.448
DON'T WORRY,
MR. FINNERTY.

03:34.482 --> 03:37.618
I'M NOT LOOKING
TO JEOPARDIZE YOUR STREAK

03:37.651 --> 03:39.453
OF 12 CONSECUTIVE YEARS

03:39.487 --> 03:42.423
OF DOING NOTHING EXTRA
TO HELP THIS SCHOOL.

03:42.456 --> 03:43.557
THAT IS VERY UNFAIR,

03:43.591 --> 03:48.862
BECAUSE I HAVE BEEN VERY...
BUSY FOR THE LAST 12 YEARS.

03:48.896 --> 03:50.764
THAT'S OK,
MR. FINNERTY.

03:50.798 --> 03:54.268
WE'LL JUST HIRE MIRACLES,
THE CHRISTIAN MAGICIAN,

03:54.302 --> 03:55.102
LIKE WE DO EVERY YEAR,

03:55.135 --> 03:57.305
AND SOMEHOW,
WE'LL ALL GET THROUGH IT.

03:57.338 --> 03:59.273
YOU WON'T HAVE TO,
BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHAT?

03:59.307 --> 04:02.042
THIS YEAR, I'LL TAKE CARE
OF THE ENTERTAINMENT.

04:02.075 --> 04:03.010
HA HA HA HA HA!

04:03.043 --> 04:06.814
SORRY, BUT THE ENTERTAINMENT
IS TOO BIG A JOB,

04:06.847 --> 04:08.416
AND NO OFFENSE,

04:08.449 --> 04:11.285
BUT THE FINNERTYS AREN'T
KNOWN AS THE "GO-TO" PEOPLE.

04:11.319 --> 04:13.454
NO, YOU'RE MORE KNOWN AS

04:13.487 --> 04:16.457
"THE PLACE WHERE
THE PHONE TREE STOPS."

04:17.625 --> 04:23.897
HA HA. YEAH. WHAT IF I TOLD YOU
I COULD GET J.J. BODYBUDDY?

04:23.931 --> 04:26.534
DON'T JERK MY BEADS,
MR. FINNERTY.

04:26.567 --> 04:28.336
I'M NOT. I'M SERIOUS.

04:28.369 --> 04:31.472
YOU EXPECT ME TO BELIEVE
THAT YOU CAN DELIVER

04:31.505 --> 04:35.643
THE MOST SOUGHT-AFTER
SCHOLASTIC PERFORMER
IN THE NORTHEAST?

04:35.676 --> 04:36.410
SO WILL YOU DO IT?

04:36.444 --> 04:40.981
SURE. WHY NOT?
I MEAN, I LOVE KIDS.

04:41.014 --> 04:44.552
Lily: MORE ROOM
FOR THE BABY!

04:45.419 --> 04:49.690
YOU DON'T HAVE
KIDS OF YOUR OWN,
DO YOU?

05:04.405 --> 05:06.106
OH, BABY.

05:06.139 --> 05:08.776
BABY WANNA DO
THE FOOT THING?

05:09.743 --> 05:11.612
SEAN!
HUH?

05:11.645 --> 05:13.714
GOD! WHOA!

05:13.747 --> 05:15.683
WHOA!

05:15.716 --> 05:16.249
WHOA.

05:16.283 --> 05:18.486
DON'T DO THE FOOT THING.

05:19.620 --> 05:21.755
OH, MY GOD.
WE GOT SO DRUNK
LAST NIGHT.

05:21.789 --> 05:27.094
OHH...MY BRAIN FEELS
LIKE IT'S COMIN' OUT
THROUGH MY EYES.

05:27.127 --> 05:29.062
* POSITIVE POWER PEOPLE

05:29.096 --> 05:32.400
* ARE THE PEOPLE WITH
THE POSITIVE POWER *

05:32.433 --> 05:33.534
* WE'VE GOT MILLONS

05:33.567 --> 05:36.036
* OF REASONS TO SMILE
OH, PLEASE, LILY!

05:36.069 --> 05:36.937
* LET US
SHUT UP!

05:36.970 --> 05:40.674
* INTO YOUR HEART
FOR AN HOUR *
STOP IT!

05:40.708 --> 05:41.341
I CAN'T!

05:41.375 --> 05:42.943
I'M A POSITIVE
POWER PERSON,

05:42.976 --> 05:44.077
AND I HAVE TO
SING ABOUT IT.

05:44.111 --> 05:46.747
I'LL GIVE YOU $100
IF YOU'LL BE QUIET.

05:46.780 --> 05:50.418
WELL, DON'T WORRY.
YOU WON'T HAVE TO HEAR ME
FOR TOO MUCH LONGER

05:50.451 --> 05:53.086
BECAUSE TODAY
I WILL BE AUDITIONING

05:53.120 --> 05:54.655
FOR THE POSITIVE
POWER PEOPLE,

05:54.688 --> 05:56.023
AND THEN I WILL BE
ON TOUR WITH THEM,

05:56.056 --> 05:58.792
AND I'LL BE OUT
OF YOUR PRECIOUS
BABY'S ROOM!

05:58.826 --> 06:01.929
OK, IF YOU'RE TRYIN'
TO DO THIS TO GET BACK
AT YOUR MOTHER,

06:01.962 --> 06:04.031
SHE'S NOT AWAKE YET.

06:04.064 --> 06:04.898
THANK YOU.

06:04.932 --> 06:06.534
* POSITIVE POWER

06:06.567 --> 06:07.468

06:24.585 --> 06:27.421
THAT'S
NOT GONNA WORK.

06:27.455 --> 06:29.189
HEY, JIMMY.

06:29.222 --> 06:31.492

THEY'RE MY GRANDFATHER'S.

06:36.163 --> 06:41.669
HE--HE HAD HORRIBLE EYES,
AND, UM, AND--
AND HE WAS POOR.

06:42.235 --> 06:43.403
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

06:43.437 --> 06:46.674
I WANTED TO SEE
IF YOU WANTED TO WALK
TO SCHOOL TOGETHER.

06:46.707 --> 06:48.809
OH. YEAH. SURE.

06:48.842 --> 06:51.479
JIMMY, WANT
TO GET DRESSED FIRST?

06:51.512 --> 06:53.046
YES! YES.

06:53.080 --> 06:54.448
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
I'M GONNA...

06:54.482 --> 06:57.718
JUST TAKE THE CEREAL
WITH ME UPSTAIRS.

07:00.521 --> 07:01.689
DAD. WHAT WERE
YOU THINKING,

07:01.722 --> 07:02.590
LETTING HER
IN THERE LIKE THAT?

07:02.623 --> 07:04.792
LOOK, SO MANY GIRLS
COME CALLIN' FOR YOU.

07:04.825 --> 07:06.660
ONE WAS BOUND
TO GET THROUGH.

07:06.694 --> 07:08.128
DAD, I LIKE HER. OK?

07:08.161 --> 07:10.197
I JUST DON'T WANT
TO BE EMBARRASSED
IN FRONT OF HER.

07:10.230 --> 07:11.431
IS THAT
TOO MUCH TO ASK?

07:11.465 --> 07:14.768
HEY, JIMMY, I--I KNOW
HE'S YOUR DAD AND
I'M JUST YOUR UNCLE,

07:14.802 --> 07:18.739
BUT I'M GONNA HAVE TO
ASK YOU TO...SHUT UP.

07:23.176 --> 07:25.178
HEY. HOW YOU

07:25.212 --> 07:26.947
OH, BABY,

07:26.980 --> 07:28.181
I'M HURTIN'.
I'M HURTIN'.

07:28.215 --> 07:30.951
SORRY I SHUT YOU DOWN
LAST NIGHT, BABY,

07:30.984 --> 07:32.653
BUT YOU WERE JUST
WAY TOO DRUNK.

07:32.686 --> 07:34.488
I WAS ON THE COUCH
ALL NIGHT.

07:34.522 --> 07:35.923
NO, YOU WEREN'T.
MAN!

07:35.956 --> 07:38.726
WAS THAT A NIGHT
OR WHAT?

07:39.026 --> 07:42.563
OH, MAN. I GOTTA
GET SOME COFFEE. AHEM!

07:42.596 --> 07:46.266
UHH! I WAS SPOONED
BY J.J. BODYBUDDY.

07:46.299 --> 07:49.537
GOD, BABY, WE NEED HIM
TO PERFORM AT THE THING,

07:49.570 --> 07:51.705
AND THEN AFTER THAT,
I CAN KICK HIS ASS. OK?

07:51.739 --> 07:53.941
HOW CAN HE PERFORM?
HE'S STILL WASTED.

07:53.974 --> 07:54.875
I KNOW. I GOTTA
SOBER HIM UP.

07:54.908 --> 07:57.210
I GOTTA DO SOMETHIN'.
I DON'T HAVE A CHOICE.

07:57.244 --> 08:00.147
HOW DID HE GET
SO WASTED?

08:00.180 --> 08:02.583
IT WAS NOT MY FAULT.

08:04.785 --> 08:06.520
MMM.

08:06.554 --> 08:08.956
I'LL TAKE THIS ONE
TO THE JOHN.

08:08.989 --> 08:10.290
UHH.

08:10.323 --> 08:12.726
I'VE NEVER SEEN ANYBODY
DRINK THAT MANY SHOTS.

08:12.760 --> 08:15.963
TRUST ME,
HE CAN HANDLE IT.
ALL RIGHT?

08:15.996 --> 08:17.798
HE'S A REALLY--
HE'S A HEALTHY GUY.

08:17.831 --> 08:20.067
HEALTHY GUYS
CAN DRINK A LOT.

08:20.100 --> 08:23.537
THAT'S RIGHT. WE
SHOULD DRINK MORE OFTEN.

08:23.571 --> 08:25.573
THAT'S, LIKE,
HIS TENTH TRIP
TO THE BATHROOM.

08:25.606 --> 08:28.308
HE'S A HEALTHY GUY.
HEALTHY GUYS GO
TO THE BATHROOM A LOT.

08:28.341 --> 08:33.046
YEAH. I'VE BEEN THINKIN'
ABOUT GOIN' TO THE BATHROOM
MORE OFTEN.

08:33.647 --> 08:34.882
HEY!

08:34.915 --> 08:38.586
J.J. BODYBUDDY

08:46.359 --> 08:48.061
LET'S GO HIT THE TOWN.
HEY, HEY!

08:48.095 --> 08:50.063
WE--WE OWN
THIS CRAP HOLE.

08:50.097 --> 08:53.266
OH. IT'S
A NICE CRAP HOLE.

08:53.300 --> 08:55.335
COME ON.
LET'S GO GET DRUNK.

08:55.368 --> 08:57.638
DON'T YOU WANT TO PUT
YOUR SKIN BACK ON FIRST?

08:57.671 --> 09:02.242
NO, NO, NO. NO WAY.
LADIES LOVE A MAN
IN UNIFORM!

09:02.275 --> 09:04.011
AAAAHHH!

09:04.044 --> 09:06.847
DAMN! BEAT ME
AGAIN!

09:06.880 --> 09:07.981
YOU CAN'T BEAT
THE CHICKEN, BABE.

09:08.015 --> 09:10.317
THE CHICKEN
IS IN YOUR HEAD.
ALL RIGHT,
ONE MORE GAME.

09:10.350 --> 09:11.785
SEAN, GIMME
ANOTHER QUARTER.
NO. NO.

09:11.819 --> 09:13.153
GIMME ANOTHER--
YOU'VE HAD ENOUGH!

09:13.186 --> 09:16.356
WHAT'RE YOU LOOKIN'

STUPID CHICKEN!

09:16.389 --> 09:19.259
YOU STUPID CHICKEN!
WHAT'RE YOU L--
COME HERE!

09:19.292 --> 09:21.294
WHAT'S GOIN' ON?
DON'T KICK MY CHICKEN.

09:21.328 --> 09:23.964
YOUR CHICKEN CHEATS.
I WANT MY MONEY BACK.

09:23.997 --> 09:26.366
NO. THE CHICKEN'S GOOD.
HE BEAT BOBBY FISCHER.

09:26.399 --> 09:29.269
I'M NOT GOIN' ANYWHERE
UNTIL I GET MY MONEY BACK.

09:29.302 --> 09:31.238
YOU BETTER LEAVE OR
THERE'LL BE TROUBLE.

09:31.271 --> 09:32.239
OH, YOU WANT
A PIECE OF ME?

09:32.272 --> 09:32.940
YES. I WANT
PIECE OF YOU.

09:32.973 --> 09:34.274
YOU CAN HAVE
THIS ONE.
WHOOH!

09:34.307 --> 09:36.376
OH,
IT'S GO TIME.
IT'S GO TIME.

09:36.409 --> 09:38.245
GET YOUR HANDS
OFF, MAN!
OK.

09:38.278 --> 09:39.847
HEY, YOU KNOW WHO
YOU'RE KICKIN' OUT?

09:39.880 --> 09:41.649
THAT GUY OPENED
FOR THE WIGGLES.

09:41.682 --> 09:43.016
I'M SORRY
ABOUT THAT,
YOU GUYS.

09:43.050 --> 09:44.685
I THOUGHT
SHE WAS
A PROSTITUTE.

09:44.718 --> 09:46.920
SHE WAS, MAN.
YOU BROUGHT HER IN.

09:46.954 --> 09:48.288
OH.

09:48.321 --> 09:53.060
WHOO! WE'VE NOT
PARTIED LIKE THIS...

09:53.093 --> 09:55.362
IN TOO LONG,
BUDDY.

09:55.395 --> 09:56.396
OH, MAN.
YOU'RE TELLIN' ME.

09:56.429 --> 09:59.633
IT'S BEEN, LIKE,
10 YEARS SINCE
I'VE HAD A DRINK.

09:59.667 --> 10:02.670
WHAT'RE YOU
TALKIN' ABOUT?

10:02.703 --> 10:05.205
I'VE BEEN CLEAN
AND SOBER SINCE '94.

10:05.238 --> 10:06.840
NOT ONE?

10:06.874 --> 10:09.076
NOT A ONE.

10:09.409 --> 10:12.379
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT I WAS THINKIN'.

10:13.180 --> 10:16.917
'CAUSE THIS
IS THE...BEST!

10:16.950 --> 10:19.386
HOO HOO HOO HOO HOO!

10:19.419 --> 10:20.954
THANK YOU, SEANY!

10:20.988 --> 10:22.756
THANK YOU, MY MAN!

10:22.790 --> 10:24.091
OH, YOINK!

10:24.124 --> 10:25.392
HELLO!

10:28.461 --> 10:29.697
YOU PUSHED HIM
OFF THE WAGON?

10:29.730 --> 10:31.799
BABY, I DIDN'T KNOW
HE HAD A PROBLEM!

10:31.832 --> 10:33.801
* POSITIVE POWER PEOPLE

10:33.834 --> 10:37.070
* ARE THE PEOPLE
WITH THE POSITIVE POWER *

10:37.104 --> 10:37.938
YOU MAKE HER STOP.

10:37.971 --> 10:38.839
NO. SHE'S JUST TRYIN'
TO GET A REACTION

10:38.872 --> 10:40.741
OUTTA ME, AND I AM NOT
GONNA GIVE HER ONE.

10:40.774 --> 10:43.176
* POSITIVE POWER PEOPLE

10:43.210 --> 10:46.379
* ARE THE PEOPLE WITH
THE POSITIVE POWER *

10:46.413 --> 10:48.415
OH, KEEP SINGING!
I LIKE IT!

10:48.448 --> 10:51.318
OH. WELL, YOU'RE NOT
GONNA GET TO HEAR IT
ANYMORE

10:51.351 --> 10:55.455
'CAUSE I'M GONNA GO SPREAD
MY POSITIVE PEOPLE POWER
IN JAPAN.

10:55.488 --> 10:56.589
OH! HAVE
A GREAT TIME.

10:56.623 --> 11:00.694
I PLAN TO.
I JUST NEED YOU TO SIGN
MY PERMISSION SLIP.

11:00.728 --> 11:03.296
OH.
THERE YOU GO.

11:03.330 --> 11:04.397
SAYONARA.

11:04.431 --> 11:06.333
I WILL.

11:07.467 --> 11:09.837
I SWEAR TO YOU,
IF HE WALKED IN HERE
RIGHT NOW,

11:09.870 --> 11:14.742
I'D SAY TO HIM,
"I HEARD WHAT
YOU SAID ABOUT ME."

11:14.775 --> 11:16.710
AND THEN I'D KILL HIM.

11:16.744 --> 11:19.913
ARE YOU STILL TALKIN'
ABOUT BILL NYE,
THE SCIENCE GUY?

11:19.947 --> 11:21.815
DON'T SAY
THAT NAME!

11:22.282 --> 11:24.451
OK. A-HUNTIN'
WE WILL GO.

11:24.484 --> 11:27.755
WHERE DOES YOUR,
UH, MOMMY KEEP
THE HARD STUFF?

11:27.788 --> 11:30.490
I KEEP TELLING YOU,
I DON'T LIVE HERE.

11:30.523 --> 11:32.492
DAVE, CALM DOWN.

11:32.525 --> 11:34.494
HEY, DON'T TELL ME
TO CALM DOWN.

11:34.527 --> 11:37.798
I'M A CHILDREN'S
EDUCATOR. RIGHT?

11:38.098 --> 11:41.468
I'M GONNA GO
THROW UP.

11:42.169 --> 11:44.471
UNCLE EDDIE.
WHAT'S WITH THE PEAS?

11:44.504 --> 11:48.308
WELL, JIM,
I...GOT WASTED WITH
YOUR DAD LAST NIGHT,

11:48.341 --> 11:51.779
AND...THESE PEAS
ARE KEEPING MY SCALP

11:51.812 --> 11:53.480
FROM EXPLODING
ALL OVER YOUR FRIEND.

11:53.513 --> 11:57.484
UM...MY DAD DOESN'T
REALLY DRINK THAT MUCH.

11:57.517 --> 11:58.485
HE PEED IN A CAB.

11:58.518 --> 12:02.389
UM, MY DAD DOESN'T REALLY
PEE IN THAT MANY CABS.

12:02.422 --> 12:03.757
COME ON. LET'S GO.

12:03.791 --> 12:05.793
IT WASN'T
HIS FAULT.
HE WAS ASLEEP.

12:05.826 --> 12:07.094
OK, COME ON.

12:07.127 --> 12:07.861
HERE. HERE. HERE.

12:07.895 --> 12:08.495
WHAT AM I SUPPOSED
TO DO WITH THAT?

12:08.528 --> 12:09.997
JUST SEW
SOME ORGANS ON IT.

12:10.030 --> 12:11.064
LOOK. THERE--THERE...
HERE'S A...

12:11.098 --> 12:13.233
I THINK THIS
IS THE LIVER, AND
THERE'S A SPLEEN...

12:13.266 --> 12:14.434
I DON'T KNOW
WHERE THEY GO.

12:14.467 --> 12:15.869
DOESN'T MATTER! OK?

12:15.903 --> 12:16.937
I'VE GOT
A HALF AN HOUR

12:16.970 --> 12:19.106
TO GET THIS TOGETHER
AND GET THIS GUY
TO THE SCHOOL.

12:19.139 --> 12:21.074
FINE. GIVE ME
THE LIVER.

12:21.108 --> 12:24.144
SEAN, BAD NEWS.
DAVE JUST HOPPED
OVER THE FENCE

12:24.177 --> 12:24.912
AND TOOK OFF.

12:24.945 --> 12:26.046
WHAT? WH-WHERE
THE HELL DID HE GO?

12:26.079 --> 12:31.418
TO PUT YOUR BARBECUE
FORK IN BILL NYE,
THE SCIENCE GUY.

12:34.087 --> 12:35.122
OH. MR. FINNERTY.

12:35.155 --> 12:37.190
I NEED TO DISCUSS
THE PROGRAM
WITH MR. BODYBUDDY.

12:37.224 --> 12:38.158
IS HE HERE?

12:38.191 --> 12:39.226
IT'S ALL GOOD.

12:39.259 --> 12:40.928
WHERE IS HE?

12:40.961 --> 12:42.762
I'M FEELIN' ALL RIGHT.

12:43.130 --> 12:44.331
HE'S NOT HERE,
IS HE?

12:44.364 --> 12:45.598
WELL, I MEAN...
IS GOD HERE?

12:45.632 --> 12:48.501
WE'D LIKE TO THINK
THAT HE IS, BUT...
YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYIN'.

12:48.535 --> 12:51.371
MMM, OH, I KNEW
I SHOULDN'T HAVE
TRUSTED YOU.

12:51.404 --> 12:54.141
I SHOULD'VE LISTENED
TO MY INSTINCTS.

12:54.174 --> 12:55.242
AND THE MONSIGNOR'S.

12:55.275 --> 12:57.177
AND THE P.T.A.
AND THE CUSTODIAN--

12:57.210 --> 13:00.313
UH, UH, OH! OH!
HE'S HERE. HA, HA!

13:00.347 --> 13:03.083
LET YE OF LITTLE FAITH
CAST THE FIRST STONE.

13:03.116 --> 13:06.920
OH, YES. YOU GOT ME
BY MISQUOTING SCRIPTURE.

13:06.954 --> 13:10.157
TELL MR. BODYBUDDY
HE'S ON IN 10.

13:11.391 --> 13:13.593
ALL RIGHT.

13:13.626 --> 13:14.594
WHERE'S DAVE?

13:14.627 --> 13:15.295
DAVE'S NOT HERE.

13:15.328 --> 13:17.464
THEN WHAT'S WITH
THE THUMBS UP?

13:17.497 --> 13:18.832
WE GOT THE SUIT.
YEAH.

13:18.866 --> 13:20.600
I WAS ABLE TO SEW ON
MOST OF THE ORGANS.

13:20.633 --> 13:22.502
THERE'S ONLY ONE KIDNEY,
BUT--BUT THAT'S OK.

13:22.535 --> 13:23.971
YOU ONLY NEED
ONE KIDNEY TO SURVIVE.

13:24.004 --> 13:26.406
THE SUIT CAN'T DO THE ACT!
WE NEED THE GUY!

13:26.439 --> 13:27.507
LOOK, HERE'S HOW
THIS'LL GO DOWN.

13:27.540 --> 13:29.442
I'LL SUGGEST THAT
YOU DANCE AROUND
IN THE ORGAN SUIT.

13:29.476 --> 13:32.179
YOU WILL RESIST.
YOU TELL ME
TO DO IT.

13:32.212 --> 13:33.546
BUT WE BOTH KNOW
IT'S GONNA BE YOU.

13:33.580 --> 13:35.849
FINE. I'M TIRED OF PEOPLE
SAYING THE FINNERTYS

13:35.883 --> 13:39.319
DON'T CONTRIBUTE
AROUND HERE. I PROMISED
THEM J.J. BODYBUDDY,

13:39.352 --> 13:40.888
AND I'M GONNA DELIVER
J.J. BODYBUDDY.

13:40.921 --> 13:42.122
I JUST HAVE TO
ASK YOU ONE THING.

13:42.155 --> 13:44.858
I'M NOT GONNA DO IT.
FINE.

13:47.527 --> 13:50.263
OH. MRS. FINNERTY,
HAVE YOU SEEN
MR. BODYBUDDY?

13:50.297 --> 13:51.464
UH, YES.
HE'S GETTING DRESSED.

13:51.498 --> 13:53.867
OH. WELL, GOOD.
WHEN HE COMES OUT,
WOULD YOU GIVE HIM THIS?

13:53.901 --> 13:56.136
SURE.
NOW, IT'S
VERY IMPORTANT
THAT HE GETS IT.

13:56.169 --> 13:58.571
IT'S THE LIST OF WORDS
HE'S NOT ALLOWED TO SAY.

13:58.605 --> 14:01.975
I DON'T KNOW WHY
HE'D WANT TO SAY THIS.

14:02.009 --> 14:04.477
I DON'T KNOW WHY
THE BICYCLE SAFETY LADY

14:04.511 --> 14:05.312
WOULD WANT
TO SAY IT, EITHER,

14:05.345 --> 14:08.215
BUT SHE DID, AND
NOW IT'S ON THE LIST.

14:08.248 --> 14:10.217
OK. I'LL MAKE SURE
HE GETS IT.

14:10.250 --> 14:14.287
SO, I UNDERSTAND LILY
MIGHT BE LEAVING US.
AW...

14:14.321 --> 14:16.023
WHAT?
WELL, UM...

14:16.056 --> 14:17.424
SHE TOLD ME THAT
SHE WENT TO AUDITION

14:17.457 --> 14:19.026
TO JOIN THE POSITIVE
POWER PEOPLE.

14:19.059 --> 14:21.294
NOW, NORMALLY I WOULD
OPPOSE A STUDENT
LEAVING SCHOOL

14:21.328 --> 14:25.032
FOR 6 MONTHS,
BUT IN LILY'S CASE,
I SEE IT AS A WIN-WIN.

14:25.065 --> 14:28.936
WELL, DON'T GET
TOO EXCITED, SISTER.
I'M NOT LETTING HER GO.

14:28.969 --> 14:31.204
BUT YOU SIGNED
THE PERMISSION SLIP.

14:31.238 --> 14:32.405
YEAH. I KNOW.
WE'RE IN THE MIDDLE

14:32.439 --> 14:34.407
OF ONE OF THOSE
PARENT-CHILD
STANDOFFS?

14:34.441 --> 14:35.308
YOU KNOW? AND
I CALLED HER BLUFF.

14:35.342 --> 14:37.044
YOU KNOW, WE HAVE
A NEW BABY
ON THE WAY,

14:37.077 --> 14:38.278
AND SHE HAS
TO REALIZE
AT SOME POINT

14:38.311 --> 14:40.647
SHE CAN'T BE THE CENTER
OF THE UNIVERSE FOREVER.

14:40.680 --> 14:45.318
YOU KNOW? SO DON'T
WORRY. I'M NOT LETTING
HER GO TO TOKYO.

14:45.585 --> 14:49.622
I'M SORRY, SISTER.
I SHOULDN'T HAVE LAID
ALL THAT ON YOU.

14:49.656 --> 14:53.660
WHAT? OH. THAT'S OK.
I...I TUNED OUT.

14:59.967 --> 15:02.369
CAROLYN. HI.
HOW'S IT GOIN'?

15:02.402 --> 15:04.571
YOU'VE GOT SOMETHING
ON YOU.

15:05.005 --> 15:06.306
TOILET SEAT COVER.

15:06.339 --> 15:09.109
UM...THAT--UH, OH, GOD.
I'M SORRY. THIS HAS
NEVER HAPPENED BEFORE.

15:09.142 --> 15:10.710
I USUALLY
JUST HOLD IT
UNTIL I GET HOME.

15:10.743 --> 15:15.382
I MEAN...
I KEEP EMBARRASSING
MYSELF IN FRONT OF YOU.

15:15.415 --> 15:16.583
I HADN'T NOTICED.

15:16.616 --> 15:19.519
WHAT? YOU JUST PULLED
A TOILET SEAT COVER
OUT OF MY PANTS.

15:19.552 --> 15:21.955
YEAH. I GUESS THOSE
KINDS OF THINGS JUST
DON'T BOTHER ME.

15:21.989 --> 15:26.626
WOW. YOU ARE UNBELIEVABLE.
WE

15:26.659 --> 15:28.495
SURE.

15:30.397 --> 15:32.232
YOU GOT A BOOGER.

15:33.233 --> 15:34.534
THANKS.

15:35.768 --> 15:37.470
MOM. WHAT
ARE YOU DOIN' HERE?

15:37.504 --> 15:40.107
OH. HEY. SISTER HELEN
TOLD ME YOU WERE
GOIN' TO JAPAN,

15:40.140 --> 15:41.574
SO I JUST CAME
TO SAY GOOD-BYE.

15:41.608 --> 15:44.344
HUH. I DIDN'T KNOW
YOU CARED.

15:44.377 --> 15:45.212
WHAT?

15:45.245 --> 15:46.679
OBVIOUSLY, YOU'RE
TRYIN' TO REPLACE ME.

15:46.713 --> 15:49.449
HONEY, I AM NOT TRYING
TO REPLACE YOU.

15:49.482 --> 15:52.652
LOOK, UH...I'M SORRY.
I MADE A MISTAKE.

15:52.685 --> 15:54.121
I SHOULD'VE TALKED
TO YOU BEFORE I MOVED

15:54.154 --> 15:55.722
ALL THAT BABY STUFF
INTO YOUR ROOM.

15:55.755 --> 15:59.059
BUT...COME ON,
YOU CAN'T THINK
FOR ONE SECOND

15:59.092 --> 16:00.493
I DON'T CARE
ABOUT YOU.

16:00.527 --> 16:03.463
AND I'M NOT
LETTING YOU GO
TO JAPAN.

16:03.496 --> 16:05.532
WELL, OK. IF THAT'S
HOW YOU FEEL ABOUT IT,

16:05.565 --> 16:08.235
I'LL JUST HAVE TO TELL
THE POSITIVE POWER PEOPLE

16:08.268 --> 16:10.303
THEY'LL HAVE TO FIND
SOMEONE ELSE.

16:10.337 --> 16:12.705
HOW BAD DID IT GO?

16:12.739 --> 16:13.706
BAD ENOUGH.
MMM.

16:13.740 --> 16:15.642
* WE'VE GOT THE POWER

16:15.675 --> 16:16.776
* YOU'VE GOT THE POWER

16:16.809 --> 16:19.346
* SO LET'S
USE THE POWER *

16:19.379 --> 16:23.583
* POSITIVE POWER

16:23.616 --> 16:25.752
OK! THAT
WAS WONDERFUL!

16:25.785 --> 16:28.721
UH, WHY DON'T
WE TAKE IT
FROM THE TOP,

16:28.755 --> 16:31.024
AND I THINK
WE COULD GO

16:31.058 --> 16:34.727
EVEN A TAD
MORE POSITIVE.

16:34.761 --> 16:37.797
* POSITIVE POWER

16:37.830 --> 16:42.202
LET'S GO AGAIN
AND SEE IF WE CAN FIND

16:42.235 --> 16:44.337
THE POWER.

16:44.371 --> 16:47.274
* POWER

16:47.307 --> 16:49.442
OK! UH, FELT THE POWER.

16:49.476 --> 16:51.678
MIGHT'VE LOT
A LITTLE POSITIVE.

16:51.711 --> 16:58.185
* POSITIVE POWER

16:58.218 --> 17:00.820
LILY, YOU'RE
GIVING ME PERIODS.

17:00.853 --> 17:01.821
EXCUSE ME?

17:01.854 --> 17:02.922
WE CAN'T SPREAD
THE MESSAGE
OF POSITIVE PEOPLE

17:02.955 --> 17:06.493
TO JAPAN AND POSSIBLY
THE PHILIPPINES
WITH PERIODS.

17:06.526 --> 17:09.729
WE NEED
EXCLAMATION POINTS!

17:09.762 --> 17:13.766
OK. YOU KNOW WHAT, SMILEY?
IT IS PHYSICALLY IMPOSSIBLE

17:13.800 --> 17:15.735
FOR ANYBODY TO BE
THAT POSITIVE!

17:15.768 --> 17:17.770
AND IF THERE WERE
PEOPLE THAT POSITIVE,

17:17.804 --> 17:18.838
THE LAST PLACE
I WOULD WANT TO BE

17:18.871 --> 17:23.743
IS STUCK
ON A PLANE WITH THEM
FOR 10 HOURS TO JAPAN!

17:23.776 --> 17:27.114
EXCLAMATION POINT!

17:28.748 --> 17:30.550
FROM THE TOP?

17:31.384 --> 17:34.721
YEAH. WELL...
I'M GLAD YOU'RE STAYING.

17:34.754 --> 17:38.558
AND JUST SO YOU KNOW,
NO MATTER HOW MANY KIDS
I HAVE,

17:38.591 --> 17:41.261
YOU WILL ALWAYS BE
MY BIGGEST BABY.

17:41.661 --> 17:42.795
FIRST...BABY.

17:42.829 --> 17:46.499
MM-HMM. WELL,
I DON'T HAVE TO GO
HALFWAY AROUND THE WORLD

17:46.533 --> 17:48.635
JUST TO SPITE
YOU AND DAD.

17:48.668 --> 17:49.302
COME ON.

17:49.336 --> 17:51.371
WHEN I CAN DO IT
RIGHT HERE,

17:51.404 --> 17:54.841
WHERE I CAN SEE
YOUR REACTIONS.

17:55.375 --> 17:56.676
GOOD MORNING,
STUDENTS.

17:56.709 --> 17:58.811
I'M VERY EXCITED
TO INTRODUCE

17:58.845 --> 18:00.147
OUR ENTERTAINMENT
FOR TODAY.

18:00.180 --> 18:03.116
UNCLE EDDIE,
WHAT ARE YOU
DOIN' HERE?

18:03.150 --> 18:04.717
SHE DOESN'T KNOW?
NO.

OF A MIRACLES?

18:55.902 --> 18:57.437
THE CHRISTIAN MAGICIAN?

18:57.470 --> 19:00.673
OK, AND THE BAD STUFF
IS CALLED WASTE.

19:00.707 --> 19:02.875

IT'S REALLY CALLED,

19:02.909 --> 19:05.712

OF THE MYSTERIES

19:12.252 --> 19:15.588
AND WONDERS
OF THE HUMAN BODY.
WHO'S GOT A QUESTION?

19:15.622 --> 19:16.489
YES.

19:16.523 --> 19:18.191
WHERE'S YOUR PANCREAS?

19:18.225 --> 19:22.395
OK. THE PANCREAS
IS LOCATED...

19:22.429 --> 19:24.197
IN THE...

19:24.231 --> 19:25.632
PANCREATIC CHAMBER...

19:25.665 --> 19:30.237
WHICH IS ROUGHLY
IN THESE GROUPINGS
OF ORGANS

19:30.270 --> 19:31.271
RIGHT THROUGH HERE.

19:31.304 --> 19:32.605
OK?
WHAT DOES IT DO?

19:32.639 --> 19:34.907
UH, OK. ONLY ONE QUESTION
PER KID. ALL RIGHT?

19:34.941 --> 19:36.543
IT'S NOT YOUR OWN
PRIVATE SHOW.

19:36.576 --> 19:38.978
ANYBODY ELSE?
YOUNG LADY.

19:39.011 --> 19:40.079
WHAT DOES
THE PANCREAS DO?

19:40.112 --> 19:43.983
SEE, IF GOD
WANTED YOU TO KNOW
WHAT IT DID,

19:44.016 --> 19:46.653
HE WOULDN'T HAVE
COVERED IT WITH SKIN.

19:46.686 --> 19:47.887

19:47.920 --> 19:50.923

19:58.398 --> 20:00.900

MR. FINNERTY.

20:00.933 --> 20:02.869

20:02.902 --> 20:07.574
WHO WOULD LIKE TO HEAR
MR. BODYBUDDY'S SONG?

20:07.607 --> 20:08.941

REALLY IMPORTANT *

20:19.552 --> 20:21.821
* 'CAUSE EVERYBODY'S

20:28.295 --> 20:30.297
NO BOOZE
NOR SMOKIN'. OK?

20:30.330 --> 20:33.733
JUST SAY NO
TO THE BAD STUFF.

20:37.504 --> 20:39.906
WOW! THAT
WAS IMPRESSIVE.

20:39.939 --> 20:41.441
YEAH. AND EDUCATIONAL.

20:41.474 --> 20:42.775
YEAH. I MEAN,
I HAD NO IDEA

20:42.809 --> 20:44.911
OVER A THIRD
OF THE ORGANS
WERE JUST FILLER.

20:44.944 --> 20:48.848
A LOT OF PEOPLE
DON'T KNOW THAT, BABE.
COME ON, LET'S GO.

20:48.881 --> 20:49.816
DON'T YOU WANT
TO CHANGE?

20:49.849 --> 20:51.784
WELL, YOU KNOW,
WHEN I GET HOME.

20:51.818 --> 20:53.920
OR TOMORROW.
WHICHEVER.
