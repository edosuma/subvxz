00:03.003 --> 00:06.302
Philip, this kitchen is a mess.
I'd appreciate some help, please.

00:06.373 --> 00:08.500
I'm cleaning out the refrigerator.

00:12.912 --> 00:14.937
Check it out. I got the perfect thing...

00:15.015 --> 00:17.313
to surprise Ashley with
at her birthday party.

00:17.384 --> 00:20.478
Yo, Geoffrey! Come on down!

00:20.754 --> 00:23.052
I'd really rather not, Master William.

00:23.690 --> 00:25.419
Come on, G, they waiting.

00:33.266 --> 00:34.858
Come on, G, kick it.

00:34.934 --> 00:36.731
Hi, kids.

00:38.004 --> 00:41.098
How are you doodly-do doing?

00:47.680 --> 00:50.911
I have never been more humiliated
in my life.

00:51.051 --> 00:54.817
I'm sorry, but we're not laughing at you.
We're laughing with you.

00:55.188 --> 00:58.157
Yo, that's just them.
I'm definitely laughing at you.

00:59.059 --> 01:02.859
Master William, you could have at least
rented a proper clown costume.

01:02.929 --> 01:06.421
- There's a nasty little stain on my shirt.
- There ain't no stain...

01:06.499 --> 01:07.898
Right there.

01:09.000 --> 01:15.074

01:16.342 --> 01:18.276
- Hi, everybody.
- Hi.

01:18.411 --> 01:20.709
Hi, almost-birthday girl.

01:20.780 --> 01:24.181
Well, sweetie, how does it feel
to be almost 12?

01:24.250 --> 01:27.811
Dad, as you get older,
birthdays have less and less significance.

01:28.121 --> 01:30.988
You know, I really stopped counting at 10.

01:32.792 --> 01:36.523
Come on, aren't you just a little bit excited
about your birthday party?

01:36.596 --> 01:40.760
I know it's a little immature,
but, yes, I can't wait.

01:40.834 --> 01:43.394
What will you wish for
when you blow your candles out?

01:43.470 --> 01:45.267
There is one thing I've been wishing for.

01:45.338 --> 01:46.532
- A doll?
- A dress?

01:46.606 --> 01:48.403
- A game?
- No.

01:49.342 --> 01:50.741
A boy!

03:01.981 --> 03:04.779
Look. This is a really good picture of him.

03:04.984 --> 03:07.680
- Who's he?
- His name is Little T.

03:07.754 --> 03:09.779
You know, that kid singer.

03:10.356 --> 03:12.415
He's not just a kid singer.

03:12.659 --> 03:15.492
He's the coolest, cutest guy
in the universe.

03:15.862 --> 03:17.887
Some would beg to differ.

03:19.365 --> 03:22.198
I've been reading all about him.
Listen to this:

03:22.268 --> 03:25.032
"He loves video games,
cheeseburgers, and basketball.

03:25.104 --> 03:28.403
"He hates rainy days, anchovies,
and phony people."

03:28.775 --> 03:30.402
He is so deep.

03:32.579 --> 03:35.707
You're telling me.
He likes all the same stuff I like.

03:36.749 --> 03:39.912
God, I'd love to meet him someday.
I wonder what I'd say.

03:39.986 --> 03:42.284
How about, "Hold the anchovies"?

03:44.490 --> 03:46.253
Very funny, Carlton.

03:47.260 --> 03:50.627
You know, it's just because
you've never really been in love.

03:52.365 --> 03:54.856
I don't like the ugly turn this is taking.

03:56.102 --> 03:57.797
Carlton, what are you talking about?

03:57.870 --> 04:00.862
I just don't think it's healthy that
Ashley's so boy crazy.

04:00.940 --> 04:04.432
Shouldn't she be playing with
those toy ponies with the pink hair?

04:05.211 --> 04:08.009
Carlton, it's just puppy love.

04:08.181 --> 04:10.376
Don't you remember your first crush?

04:10.483 --> 04:13.611
<i>Yeah. It was Tootie in The Facts of Life.</i>

04:19.858 --> 04:22.692
Wait. You had a love thing for Tootie?

04:24.931 --> 04:26.262
When did you get over it?

04:26.332 --> 04:30.200
What do you mean "get over it"?
I'd still love to meet her someday.

04:30.403 --> 04:31.995
I wonder what I'd say.

04:32.472 --> 04:35.498
How about, "Hello, Tootie, I'm Fruity"?

04:36.843 --> 04:39.573
Just because you've never been in love...

04:41.948 --> 04:44.849
I've got the perfect idea
for Ashley's birthday present.

04:44.917 --> 04:47.681
- What's that, sweetheart?
- I know Little T's agent.

04:47.754 --> 04:49.722
He used to go out with my friend Jennifer.

04:49.789 --> 04:53.384
I'll bet he could get Ashley
a front row seat at Little T's next concert.

04:53.459 --> 04:55.620
Listen, Hilary, if you know his agent...

04:55.695 --> 04:58.596
you can get something
twice as good as that.

04:59.432 --> 05:00.797
Two seats.

05:03.903 --> 05:05.996
Let me walk you through this one.

05:07.106 --> 05:09.700
Tomorrow is Ashley's birthday party.

05:10.243 --> 05:13.007
Ashley has a crush on Little T.

05:13.446 --> 05:15.607
Birthday party. Little T.

05:19.252 --> 05:21.243
Something beginning to gel here?

05:22.488 --> 05:25.480
Wouldn't it be nice
if Little T came to Ashley's birthday party?

05:25.558 --> 05:26.650
That would be so cute.

05:26.726 --> 05:29.593
Will everybody please be quiet?
I'm trying to think.

05:38.604 --> 05:42.335
This party has been going on for an hour.
When is Little T gonna get here?

05:42.408 --> 05:44.376
You know nothing about celebrities.

05:44.444 --> 05:46.571
They always come to parties
fashionably late.

05:46.646 --> 05:50.446
For a celebrity, being an hour late
is like being half an hour early.

05:50.516 --> 05:53.917
Yeah? Well, if he's not here
15 minutes ago, that's his butt.

05:59.959 --> 06:02.723
Hi, kids. I'm Tidy the Clown.

06:02.795 --> 06:04.660
We are going to play a new game.

06:04.731 --> 06:08.167
It's called
Clean Up After Your Spoiled Little Selves.

06:10.069 --> 06:12.799
- Mom, Dad, make him stop.
- What's the matter, baby?

06:12.872 --> 06:16.103
Come on, a clown at a birthday party?
It's so babyish.

06:16.175 --> 06:19.338
No, it's cool.
I'm about to get this party started right.

06:20.246 --> 06:23.545
All right, kids, check it out.
I'm Ashley's cousin, Will...

06:23.616 --> 06:26.380
and I'm about to hip y'all
to this new style of dancing.

06:26.452 --> 06:29.285
It's called dumb dancing,
and no matter what you do...

06:29.355 --> 06:31.880
you got to have a serious mug on
the whole time.

06:31.958 --> 06:33.619
So y'all peep this here.

07:03.356 --> 07:05.449
All right. Come on. Now you give it a try.

07:05.525 --> 07:07.390
Yeah, like that'll be happening.

07:08.494 --> 07:10.655
Yeah, man, who invited the old guy?

07:11.931 --> 07:14.422
My brother, you want to take this outside?

07:16.669 --> 07:19.934
Will, will you cut it out?
You are wrecking the party.

07:20.006 --> 07:23.669
I mean, this stuff is for babies:
Clowns, dance contests.

07:23.743 --> 07:28.009
Hi, kids. Prepare to be amazed.
It's time for the great Carltoni.

07:30.349 --> 07:32.340
I wish I was never born.

07:35.421 --> 07:37.685
Great. Now, that's Little T's agent.

07:37.757 --> 07:40.885
<i>I was the only one who thought
Home Alone would make money.</i>

07:40.960 --> 07:43.428
Yeah, that was me. Got to go.

07:43.930 --> 07:45.898
- Lee.
- Hilary.

07:46.766 --> 07:49.894
Listen, sorry I'm late,
but I was just at Goldie's house...

07:49.969 --> 07:52.870
and Goldie and Chevy and Mel were there.

07:53.139 --> 07:55.835
It just turned into a thing and, you know...

07:55.908 --> 07:58.877
As usual, I had to straighten it out.
But, you know...

07:58.945 --> 08:00.276
Exactly.

08:01.414 --> 08:03.507
Well, is Little T here?

08:03.583 --> 08:06.211
Hey, would I lie to you?

08:42.955 --> 08:44.616
Happy birthday, Ashley.

08:57.904 --> 08:59.735
Are you feeling better?

08:59.805 --> 09:03.536
I can't believe I just did that.
This is so embarrassing.

09:04.477 --> 09:06.968
- It's not so bad.
- Come on.

09:07.046 --> 09:10.675
I've always been planning on things to say
if I got a chance to meet you.

09:10.750 --> 09:13.810
Then I finally meet you,
and I don't even make a sound.

09:13.886 --> 09:15.581
I don't know about that.

09:15.655 --> 09:18.215
You made a pretty good thud
when you hit the ground.

09:18.958 --> 09:21.859
Did I really? God, I can't even faint right.

09:22.161 --> 09:23.526
Come on.

09:23.596 --> 09:27.191
You mean this is the most embarrassing
thing that's ever happened to you?

09:27.266 --> 09:29.734
- I guess not.
- What was?

09:30.136 --> 09:32.400
I can't tell you. It's too embarrassing.

09:32.471 --> 09:34.564
I'll tell you
my most embarrassing moment.

09:34.640 --> 09:36.938
I was dressing for gym class
during a fire drill...

09:37.009 --> 09:39.807
and I had to run out of the building
in my drawers.

09:41.614 --> 09:45.641
Okay, I'll tell you mine.
It was the Honor Day assembly.

09:45.718 --> 09:48.278
I was sitting with my legs crossed
for the whole time.

09:48.354 --> 09:50.788
And when they called my name
for the English award...

09:50.856 --> 09:54.986
I stood up and started across the stage,
only my leg was asleep.

09:55.261 --> 09:58.594
And then, thwap! I fell flat on my face.

10:00.299 --> 10:01.766
Come to think of it...

10:01.834 --> 10:05.133
most of my embarrassing moments
involve me hitting the floor.

10:05.204 --> 10:08.264
You're really funny. You're really cool, too.

10:08.708 --> 10:10.505
- Who, me?
- Yeah.

10:11.177 --> 10:14.669
Look, I've got to go.
Sorry we didn't have more time to talk.

10:15.014 --> 10:18.006
I mean, what with you being
unconscious and all.

10:20.419 --> 10:23.149
- Okay, thanks for coming.
- Sure.

10:26.559 --> 10:29.756
- Look, you want to go out sometime?
- Who, me?

10:31.364 --> 10:33.924
I thought we'd go out for pizza
tomorrow night.

10:34.000 --> 10:35.661
I mean, if you're free.

10:35.735 --> 10:39.034
I'd have to check my calendar,
but I think I'm free.

10:39.705 --> 10:41.900
Okay, then can I come around 7:00?

10:43.042 --> 10:45.476
- Okay.
- Okay, then.

10:48.514 --> 10:52.450
- I guess I'll go now.
- I'll walk you to the door.

11:14.173 --> 11:16.164
I'm hungry. Would you like a sandwich?

11:16.242 --> 11:19.109
No, thanks, Mom. I'm just too excited.

11:19.178 --> 11:22.545
I can never eat before a big date.
Do I look okay?

11:22.882 --> 11:26.181
Hilary, it's not even your date.
It's Ashley's date.

11:26.452 --> 11:28.943
Yeah, but still, do I look okay?

11:30.156 --> 11:31.919
Hilary, baby, calm down.

11:31.991 --> 11:36.087
I'm sorry, Mom, but this is
the most exciting day in a girl's life.

11:36.162 --> 11:39.859
I mean, it's Ashley's first date.
And it's with a celebrity.

11:40.566 --> 11:43.831
It is so gratifying
to see her developing the right values.

11:49.375 --> 11:51.775
- Guys, don't do that.
- What?

11:51.844 --> 11:55.302
You know, sigh like that.
You make me feel like Benji.

11:56.782 --> 12:00.183
Okay. We're just excited, that's all.
We'll calm down.

12:00.252 --> 12:02.743
- Thanks. Could you check my hair?
- Sure.

12:06.125 --> 12:09.151
Thanks. I'm gonna go in the living room
and wait for Little T.

12:09.228 --> 12:12.356
Just a second.
Baby, I just want to get one picture.

12:19.805 --> 12:21.864
Mom, not the camcorder.

12:21.974 --> 12:24.442
But, sweetheart, this is your first date.

12:24.510 --> 12:27.775
- This only happens once in your life.
- Thank God.

12:29.014 --> 12:32.211
Okay, now turn around
so we can see your pretty dress.

12:34.186 --> 12:37.019
Go back out and come in again
the way you did.

12:37.089 --> 12:41.025
Go on. Hilary, you sit there
drinking your coffee the way you were.

12:49.702 --> 12:51.829
That was great.

12:51.904 --> 12:55.169
No, Mom. Let's do it again.
I wasn't happy with what I did.

12:56.909 --> 12:58.706
Ashley, go back out again.

12:58.844 --> 13:01.836
Guys, will you cut it out?
You're driving me crazy.

13:02.181 --> 13:03.739
He's a very special boy...

13:03.816 --> 13:06.614
and I don't want to be so nervous
that I mess things up.

13:06.752 --> 13:09.585
In case you don't remember,
this is my first date.

13:13.392 --> 13:17.021
I'm telling you, Uncle Phil,
he kissed her right on her mouth.

13:17.296 --> 13:18.923
It was really more on the cheek.

13:18.998 --> 13:21.523
Yeah, but he was aiming for her mouth
and he missed.

13:21.600 --> 13:23.795
The kid is not only aggressive,
but inaccurate...

13:23.869 --> 13:26.030
and that's a dangerous combination.

13:27.807 --> 13:32.141
You're getting all worked up over nothing.
He's just a 13-year-old boy.

13:32.211 --> 13:34.543
Uncle Phil, you don't understand.
This is serious.

13:34.613 --> 13:37.173
I know what goes on
in the mind of a 13-year-old boy.

13:37.249 --> 13:40.741
Considering you still have the mind
of a 13-year-old boy.

13:41.821 --> 13:43.448
Will's got a good point.

13:43.522 --> 13:47.219
When I was 13, I harbored some
pretty impure thoughts about Tootie.

13:49.028 --> 13:52.395
Look, I wasn't thrilled about her going out
in the first place.

13:52.464 --> 13:55.956
She's only 12.
But she had her heart set on it.

13:56.035 --> 14:00.028
Besides, the kid's agent is chaperoning.
So what could possibly happen?

14:00.940 --> 14:03.807
That's them. This discussion is at an end.

14:04.610 --> 14:07.340
Master T and Mr. Lee Cohen.

14:08.380 --> 14:10.177
Hey, you're English.

14:10.249 --> 14:12.240
You know,
I represent some English bands.

14:12.318 --> 14:14.650
- Ever heard of Duran Duran?
- Why, yes.

14:14.720 --> 14:16.551
When they came to me,
they were just Duran.

14:16.622 --> 14:18.920
I added the second Duran, and bang-o!

14:20.492 --> 14:23.154
You must be so proud.

14:25.164 --> 14:26.563
Hi, Mr. Banks.

14:27.032 --> 14:28.966
I brought some flowers for Ashley.

14:29.034 --> 14:32.970
Now, that's sweet.
Isn't that sweet, Will, Carlton?

14:33.038 --> 14:34.835
Yeah, real sweet.

14:36.742 --> 14:39.609
- This evening should be fun.
- I hope it will be, son.

14:39.678 --> 14:42.408
Ashley's in the kitchen.
Why don't you join her?

14:44.183 --> 14:45.616
Isn't that sweet?

14:45.684 --> 14:48.175
He seems really excited
about his first date.

14:48.254 --> 14:50.245
First date? Dream on.

14:51.957 --> 14:54.687
- First date today, maybe.
- Pardon me?

14:54.760 --> 14:57.729
When he's on tour, he's gotta beat
the chicks away with a stick.

14:57.796 --> 14:59.923
Wish I had a piece of that action.

15:01.166 --> 15:03.464
- Action.
- Isn't that sweet?

15:05.771 --> 15:08.035
You kids have a great time
at the pizza place.

15:08.107 --> 15:09.165
We will.

15:09.241 --> 15:11.675
Did you hear that? "We will."

15:13.879 --> 15:15.813
All right, kids. Let's party.

15:15.881 --> 15:18.782
Okay, sweetie. Bye-bye. Have a good time.

15:19.018 --> 15:21.816
- Have fun, you guys.
- Bye-bye.

15:25.324 --> 15:26.985
- Follow them.
- Out.

15:31.730 --> 15:33.789
<i>When I first read the script
of Pretty Woman...</i>

15:33.866 --> 15:35.731
<i>it was called Attractive Woman.</i>

15:35.801 --> 15:39.134
I said, "Come on, guys,
let's go all the way with this."

15:39.204 --> 15:41.866
So they changed the title, and bang-o!

15:44.143 --> 15:46.839
- So, what's your favorite video game?
- Tetris.

15:46.912 --> 15:49.073
- Me, too.
- I brought my Game Boy.

15:49.148 --> 15:51.616
- So you want to play?
- Okay.

15:59.191 --> 16:01.421
He's got his arm around her already.

16:01.627 --> 16:04.596
That's the same arm I used when I was 13.

16:05.664 --> 16:09.930
- It's that love arm.
- We better work fast. Let's roll.

16:13.572 --> 16:16.040
Hey, Ashley, Little T, what's going on?

16:16.108 --> 16:17.598
What are you two doing here?

16:17.676 --> 16:21.442
Uncle Phil got hungry,
so he sent us to pick up a dozen pizzas.

16:23.615 --> 16:27.016
- Ashley, can I speak to you for a minute?
- Excuse me.

16:28.287 --> 16:31.085
- What do you want?
- Don't get upset, but it's your hair.

16:31.156 --> 16:33.920
It's doing a weird kind of bird's nest thing.

16:33.993 --> 16:36.518
You might wanna get a hairbrush
and fix it.

16:36.595 --> 16:38.085
I'll be right back.

16:47.473 --> 16:49.600
I'm gonna be straight with you.

16:51.710 --> 16:55.874
You're going out with my little cousin.
You better not try nothing.

16:58.217 --> 17:00.777
Don't give me that innocent role.

17:02.087 --> 17:04.714
I know what you people
in the music business are like.

17:04.790 --> 17:06.416
Makes me sick.

17:08.060 --> 17:11.223
Sorry, but I don't know
what you're talking about.

17:12.931 --> 17:15.627
Perhaps this will refresh your memory.

17:15.701 --> 17:17.999
<i>From the current issue
of Right On! magazine.</i>

17:18.069 --> 17:21.039
There's a picture of you
at the recent Soul Train Awards.

17:21.106 --> 17:25.634
Maybe you'd be kind enough to tell us
who this bimbo is on your arm.

17:25.711 --> 17:27.201
That's my mom.

17:31.083 --> 17:32.311
Sorry.

17:38.223 --> 17:41.351
All right.
You covered yourself on that one...

17:41.427 --> 17:44.328
but what about this girlie action
you been getting on tour?

17:44.396 --> 17:46.489
Your agent told me all about it.

17:47.066 --> 17:50.502
Did you believe my agent?
Man, he lies about everything.

17:51.537 --> 17:54.097
He told me
I could have a career in singing.

17:56.275 --> 17:59.403
Look, guys, with all the recording,
touring, and my homework...

17:59.478 --> 18:01.673
I haven't had any time for girls.

18:01.747 --> 18:05.012
To tell you the truth,
this is my first real date.

18:05.751 --> 18:07.013
I knew that.

18:09.088 --> 18:12.285
I just brought Carlton down
'cause I had to prove it to him.

18:12.357 --> 18:13.654
Let's go.

18:18.263 --> 18:21.596
Carlton, I looked at my hair
and it was fine.

18:21.667 --> 18:24.966
If you two don't mind,
I'd like to continue with my date alone.

18:25.037 --> 18:27.699
- Okay, we're going.
- Check you later, Ash.

18:30.509 --> 18:34.445
- What was that all about?
- I don't know. Don't worry about it.

18:35.047 --> 18:37.880
- So, you want to play some more Tetris?
- Okay.

18:40.119 --> 18:42.883
- I'm really having a good time, Ashley.
- So am I.

18:51.630 --> 18:53.029
I don't believe you, Philip.

18:53.098 --> 18:55.931
Sending Will and Carlton
to spy on your own daughter?

18:56.001 --> 18:58.333
What's wrong with that?
She is my daughter.

18:58.403 --> 19:00.132
I'd do it again, damn it.

19:01.173 --> 19:04.540
Word to big bird. Just say the word
and we there, Uncle Phil.

19:04.610 --> 19:08.273
But this was such a big night for Ashley.
Mom and I were so happy for her.

19:08.347 --> 19:10.110
What got into you guys?

19:11.316 --> 19:13.614
I know it was a big night for her.

19:14.953 --> 19:17.114
I knew it had to come sometime.

19:17.189 --> 19:19.680
I just didn't think it would come so soon.

19:20.726 --> 19:22.387
She's really growing up.

19:23.362 --> 19:26.820
I guess it's time for us
to stop butting into her life so much.

19:26.999 --> 19:28.466
No, it's not!

19:29.535 --> 19:31.127
Hi, everybody.

19:31.203 --> 19:34.138
- How did it go?
- I'm not going to talk about it.

19:34.606 --> 19:36.836
Come on. Please.

19:37.309 --> 19:39.834
Okay. Well, he did kiss me.

19:45.350 --> 19:47.341
I want to hear all the details.

19:47.419 --> 19:49.250
We'll pop some popcorn, do our nails...

19:49.321 --> 19:52.552
and you can tell me every single thing
that happened tonight.

19:52.624 --> 19:55.092
I'd like a written copy of that report.

19:57.062 --> 19:58.723
Ashley, sweetie...

19:59.298 --> 20:03.325
when you walked in from that date
with that smile on your face...

20:04.069 --> 20:07.732
- That's a moment I will always remember.
- That's nice, Mom.

20:08.440 --> 20:11.807
Could you go out and do it again,
and I'll go get the camcorder?

20:12.211 --> 20:14.907
- Mom.
- Okay, just asking.

20:15.614 --> 20:17.104
Good night.

20:18.350 --> 20:20.113
My little princess.

20:21.253 --> 20:24.984
I cannot believe my little girl
went out on a real date tonight.

20:25.057 --> 20:26.786
He's a really nice guy, Daddy.

20:26.858 --> 20:29.656
I know, but there's something
you should know, sweetheart.

20:29.728 --> 20:30.717
What?

20:30.796 --> 20:33.492
I'm never gonna like anybody
you bring home.

20:34.499 --> 20:38.162
- That's awfully fair of you.
- It's not that they're not good.

20:38.704 --> 20:41.264
It's just that
nobody is good enough for you.

20:44.977 --> 20:46.638
Good night, Daddy.

20:49.748 --> 20:52.615
Look, I'm just sorry I wrecked your date.

20:52.684 --> 20:55.847
You didn't, Will.
It was the most wonderful night of my life.

20:55.921 --> 20:57.718
Really? That's great.

20:57.789 --> 21:00.189
I think your second date
will be even better...

21:00.259 --> 21:03.387
'cause when you're 21,
you can appreciate these things more.

21:04.329 --> 21:07.196
Will, I'm going out with him again
next Saturday.

21:07.266 --> 21:10.167
Next Saturday I'm busy.
You'll have to change that.

21:10.469 --> 21:13.302
I know you're busy.
That's why I made it for then.

21:14.806 --> 21:17.297
- Good night, Will.
- Good night, Ash.

21:28.987 --> 21:30.215
You should try rapping.

21:30.289 --> 21:32.382
When you're rapping,
you mess up the words...

21:32.457 --> 21:35.085
and make up some new ones
right there on the spot.

21:35.227 --> 21:38.390
Let's try this. I'll sing one line,
you make up a line to rhyme it.

21:38.463 --> 21:40.522
- Okay.
- All right. Let's see.

21:41.033 --> 21:43.866
"You didn't get into
Miss Berkley's chorus"

21:46.672 --> 21:50.130
- I'm thinking, all right?
- That's all right. We got all day.

21:50.509 --> 21:52.841
- Okay, I've got it.
- Here we go.

21:53.111 --> 21:55.579
"You didn't get into
Miss Berkley's chorus"

21:55.647 --> 21:58.810
"I'd like to hit her in the head
with Roget's Thesaurus"

21:58.884 --> 22:01.785
"Don't need no choir
when you're a rapper"

22:01.987 --> 22:04.751
"Gonna hunt Miss Berkley down
and zap her"

22:04.823 --> 22:07.314
"Got this whole town of Bel-Air buzzing"

22:07.459 --> 22:10.394
"Get a load of me and my rapping cousin"

22:11.305 --> 22:17.292
