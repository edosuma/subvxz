00:10.802 --> 00:11.636
[Jen and Judy grunt]

00:11.720 --> 00:13.722
[gulping]

00:20.812 --> 00:21.646
[sighs]

00:22.188 --> 00:24.024
Ooh, God, I gotta pee.

00:24.107 --> 00:25.442
Then stop drinking so much water.

00:25.525 --> 00:27.986
Because I have so much dust
in my throat. [coughs]

00:28.069 --> 00:30.739
-Well, then, drink some water.
-Okay. [gulps]

00:30.822 --> 00:32.323
-Oh, no.
-[sighs]

00:32.657 --> 00:34.117
-Oh, no, no, no.
-What?

00:34.325 --> 00:35.410
Is my phone in my bag?

00:35.493 --> 00:36.453
-What?
-My phone.

00:36.536 --> 00:38.830
Can you look in my bag
and see if my phone is there?

00:40.123 --> 00:41.041
No, I don't see it.

00:41.124 --> 00:43.126
Oh, fuck, fuck, fucking fuck!

00:43.877 --> 00:45.712
I think I might have left it back there.

00:46.171 --> 00:47.088
-What?
-Yeah.

00:47.172 --> 00:48.631
You wouldn't do that. Why would you?

00:48.715 --> 00:50.258
-I don't know.
-You must have it somewhere.

00:50.341 --> 00:52.302
I don't. I fucking don't, Judy.
We have to go back.

00:52.385 --> 00:54.012
Oh, my God, what if I left it in the hole?

00:54.095 --> 00:55.597
-Oh, Jesus!
-Oh, my God.

00:55.680 --> 00:57.515
-Wait, I'll call it.
-No, don't fucking call it!

00:57.599 --> 00:58.808
-Why not?
-Are you fucking insane?

00:58.892 --> 01:00.310
-Why?
-If it rings in the hole,

01:00.393 --> 01:01.561
it's like a megaphone saying,

01:01.644 --> 01:03.354
"Hey everybody,
there's a fucking body in here!"

01:03.438 --> 01:05.315
-You're right, that's insane.
-This is a disaster.

01:05.398 --> 01:08.026
This is a fucking disaster! This is a--
Oh, here it is.

01:08.610 --> 01:09.986
-[exhales]
-We're fine.

01:10.737 --> 01:11.571
Fine.

01:13.490 --> 01:14.657
-[zips bag]
-[exhales]

01:19.037 --> 01:20.455
Oh, my God, is that for us?

01:20.538 --> 01:21.372
Is it?

01:21.456 --> 01:24.125
[shudders]
How could it not be? It's right behind us.

01:25.001 --> 01:26.628
I know. Um...

01:27.712 --> 01:29.005
I hate to say this, but we are

01:29.589 --> 01:32.175
two middle-aged white women
in a Mercedes.

01:32.258 --> 01:34.636
I know, and I appreciate you
acknowledging your privilege,

01:34.719 --> 01:36.179
but we also just buried a body.

01:36.262 --> 01:37.680
Which nobody knows about.

01:37.764 --> 01:39.015
-[siren wails]
-[officer] <i>Pull over.</i>

01:39.099 --> 01:40.141
Shit.

01:40.225 --> 01:42.477
We have shovels in the car.

01:42.852 --> 01:43.937
We were gardening.

01:44.020 --> 01:45.271
Oh, God, in the forest?

01:45.396 --> 01:47.273
How do you think
forest people get their food?

01:47.357 --> 01:49.776
Well, what, were we planting fruit trees
in the forest?

01:49.859 --> 01:51.194
Berries for foraging. Foraging!

01:51.277 --> 01:52.987
Say we were planting berries for foraging.

01:53.071 --> 01:55.281
We're berry planters. Got it. Oh, God.

01:55.365 --> 01:57.575
-[Jen] What kind of berries?
-I don't know. Raspberries?

01:57.659 --> 01:59.452
[Jen] It's not raspberry season.

01:59.911 --> 02:02.038
-Forget it, okay? Just don't say a word.
-Okay.

02:02.122 --> 02:05.125
-Don't say anything, Judy.
-Okay, I won't. [panting]

02:05.250 --> 02:06.126
Maybe I should just gun it.

02:06.209 --> 02:07.418
-You can't gun it.
-No, I think--

02:07.502 --> 02:09.420
-[knocks]
-[both gasp]

02:11.881 --> 02:13.049
-Hi.
-How are you?

02:15.218 --> 02:16.052
Was it worth it?

02:17.637 --> 02:19.097
-What?
-What was? Was what?

02:19.889 --> 02:21.099
You committed a crime.

02:23.268 --> 02:24.477
N-no.

02:26.187 --> 02:27.105
You're driving.

02:29.566 --> 02:32.110
As soon as that phone is in your hand,
you're committing a crime.

02:34.070 --> 02:35.446
[both] Oh.

02:35.655 --> 02:37.448
-I didn't know that.
-[officer] What was so important

02:37.532 --> 02:38.908
you had to look at it while driving?

02:39.409 --> 02:41.369
-[sighs] GPS.
-The...

02:41.452 --> 02:42.662
-Yeah, the maps.
-Yeah.

02:42.745 --> 02:43.580
I couldn't... 

02:43.663 --> 02:45.915
You don't need the GPS.
I can tell you where you are.

02:45.999 --> 02:47.250
Up shit's creek.

02:52.463 --> 02:54.841
[laughs] I'm just messing with you.

02:54.924 --> 02:56.176
You're getting a ticket, though.

02:56.259 --> 02:59.095
-Oh.
-[all chuckling]

02:59.179 --> 03:01.723
-You should've seen your face.
-[Judy laughing] A ticket.

03:01.848 --> 03:03.266
-Silly Willy McGilly.
-License and registration.

03:03.391 --> 03:05.685
-Yep, yep.
-[Judy continues laughing]

03:12.400 --> 03:14.110
[Jen] You really can't wait till a hotel?

03:14.194 --> 03:16.613
[Judy inhales]
I've been holding it in for six hours.

03:28.750 --> 03:31.002
Excuse me. Um...

03:31.961 --> 03:34.714
Uh, what-- what kind of pie is that one?

03:34.797 --> 03:35.840
Cherry.

03:35.924 --> 03:37.884
Is it, um... is it good?

03:37.967 --> 03:39.052
It's cherry.

03:40.220 --> 03:44.015
Well, cherry can be shitty,
but what about that? What's...

03:44.474 --> 03:45.308
Cherry.

03:45.391 --> 03:47.685
Oh, okay.
I guess I'm gonna have the cherry.

03:51.481 --> 03:54.567
I can't fucking believe we got a ticket.
Now there's record we were here.

03:55.026 --> 03:55.944
Fucking Shandy.

03:57.445 --> 03:58.404
This pie is really dry.

03:58.821 --> 03:59.781
-You want some?
-No.

04:01.074 --> 04:02.242
Oh, man.

04:02.617 --> 04:04.369
It's just like, everything hurts.

04:05.411 --> 04:08.122
It feels like my spine is trying
to claw its way out of my back.

04:09.749 --> 04:12.293
You sure you're not hungry
or anything? They have waffles.

04:12.377 --> 04:13.294
I'm not hungry.

04:17.298 --> 04:18.132
Look...

04:19.050 --> 04:22.804
I feel bad that we couldn't attend

04:22.887 --> 04:25.932
to the more spiritual tidbits
that you wanted

04:26.015 --> 04:28.601
to include in what we just did, but...

04:29.435 --> 04:31.521
we couldn't risk getting caught, Judy.

04:31.604 --> 04:33.773
I mean, we really had
to get in and out, right?

04:33.856 --> 04:35.024
I mean, yeah, right.

04:35.775 --> 04:38.611
But it took a really long time.
It's not like we just got in and got out.

04:38.695 --> 04:39.904
-Right, we had to--
-[Marva] Refill?

04:40.405 --> 04:41.990
Yes, please. Thank you, Marva.

04:43.157 --> 04:45.285
Marva, could I get
some whipped cream for this?

04:45.785 --> 04:47.704
It's a little dry. Thank you.

04:49.122 --> 04:52.542
Look, all I'm saying is that
we just didn't have time to, like,

04:53.001 --> 04:53.835
dilly-dally.

04:53.918 --> 04:56.546
-I wasn't trying to dilly-dally.
-You know what I mean.

04:56.629 --> 04:59.674
I just wanted to sing a song for Steve
or maybe say a few things.

04:59.757 --> 05:00.591
I know.

05:00.675 --> 05:03.511
But we didn't know who was out there
or who could hear us.

05:03.594 --> 05:05.430
Okay, so I'm sorry if I got a little rigid

05:05.513 --> 05:07.765
'cause we couldn't stop
to sing "Halle-fucking-lujah."

05:08.516 --> 05:09.475
Just so you know...

05:10.977 --> 05:11.811
Thank you.

05:12.395 --> 05:13.855
I wasn't gonna sing that song.

05:13.938 --> 05:15.106
I know it's played out.

05:15.189 --> 05:16.149
I just wanted to give...

05:17.066 --> 05:19.027
give the moment a sense of occasion.

05:19.110 --> 05:20.611
This is what I'm saying, Judy.

05:20.695 --> 05:22.155
Not everything is a fucking, like,

05:22.238 --> 05:25.616
Disney-movie's-about-to-start fucking
castles with fucking sparkle time, okay?

05:26.117 --> 05:28.369
We are not in <i>Snow White</i> here.

05:28.453 --> 05:30.079
We are in fucking <i>Scarface.</i>

05:30.163 --> 05:31.456
Well, I've never seen that.

05:31.539 --> 05:33.207
Neither have I. No girls have.

05:33.291 --> 05:34.417
But we know what it's about.

05:38.296 --> 05:40.006
-[air hisses]
-Really?

05:41.049 --> 05:42.216
She did that on purpose.

05:45.553 --> 05:47.430
Shouldn't we have stopped
someplace less fancy?

05:47.513 --> 05:48.806
It's just a shower pit stop.

05:48.890 --> 05:51.893
I know, but I didn't have time to
Trufflepig my way through Priceline, okay?

05:51.976 --> 05:53.853
I just...
I can't handle this level of dirty.

05:53.936 --> 05:55.146
I feel like a frat house toilet.

05:55.730 --> 05:57.940
You think we're gonna get a room?
It's so last-minute.

05:58.024 --> 05:59.609
It's the middle of nowhere.
No one stays here.

05:59.692 --> 06:01.652
I'm sorry,
we don't have anything available.

06:01.736 --> 06:02.570
What's that now?

06:02.653 --> 06:05.281
We have a wedding this weekend,
so we're all booked up. I'm sorry.

06:05.365 --> 06:07.867
Okay, you literally don't have anything?

06:08.951 --> 06:10.244
Hmm.

06:12.580 --> 06:13.831
Yeah, thought so.

06:14.499 --> 06:17.585
[clacking on keyboard]

06:22.048 --> 06:24.050
[clacking continues]

06:26.344 --> 06:29.806
Oh! Actually, I can offer you
our presidential suite.

06:29.889 --> 06:31.265
It's a two-night minimum, but the rate--

06:31.349 --> 06:33.059
I don't want to know. We'll take it.

06:33.684 --> 06:35.520
I got this, okay? My treat.

06:36.479 --> 06:38.314
Are you ladies in town
for business or pleasure?

06:38.398 --> 06:39.232
-Pleasure.
-Business.

06:39.899 --> 06:40.733
-Business.
-Pleasure.

06:42.110 --> 06:45.071
No, it's just a gals' weekend
with my best friend.

06:45.405 --> 06:46.531
My befri.

06:47.198 --> 06:48.032
Right?

06:48.491 --> 06:49.367
Yeah.

06:51.994 --> 06:53.955
Who the fuck gets married
in Antelope Valley?

06:54.664 --> 06:56.624
-People from Antelope Valley?
-[elevator bell dings]

06:56.707 --> 06:57.708
Oh, I guess.

06:57.792 --> 06:58.668
-Jen.
-Jeff.

06:58.751 --> 06:59.585
-Hey.
-Hi.

06:59.669 --> 07:00.670
-Hi.
-Hi, Jeff.

07:00.753 --> 07:01.587
Hello, Jen.

07:01.671 --> 07:05.216
[stammers] Judy, this is...
You know my neighbor Karen?

07:05.299 --> 07:07.093
-Yeah.
-Yeah, this is her husband Jeff.

07:07.176 --> 07:09.470
-Oh, wow, Karen is so nice.
-Yeah. So hi.

07:09.554 --> 07:10.596
-Yeah, she's great.
-Is she here?

07:10.680 --> 07:13.891
-[Jeff] Uh, no, no, no.
-Bummer, bummer, bummer. Okay, all right.

07:13.975 --> 07:16.227
Yeah, it's just a business trip, so...

07:16.310 --> 07:17.687
-[Jen] Great.
-You here for the wedding?

07:17.770 --> 07:20.106
-No, we're having a girls' weekend.
-[Jeff] Oh, fun.

07:20.481 --> 07:22.233
-I got our coffees, babe.
-Oh.

07:22.316 --> 07:25.278
-"Babe." [gasps]
-[Jeff] Thank you.

07:26.487 --> 07:27.655
Jen, listen, could you...

07:27.738 --> 07:29.615
-[sighs] ...maybe not--
-Yep. All good. Mm-hmm.

07:29.699 --> 07:31.033
-Okay.
-[Jen] Yep. Nope.

07:31.117 --> 07:32.577
The only reason that I even put--

07:32.660 --> 07:34.120
-We were never here.
-[laughs] Sure.

07:34.203 --> 07:36.205
-It doesn't have to go that far.
-Okay, bye-bye.

07:36.289 --> 07:39.667
Thank you, I just-- thank-- oh, fuck.

07:42.795 --> 07:44.005
Oh, my God.

07:45.256 --> 07:46.799
I can't believe we did that.

07:46.883 --> 07:48.509
We still have to deal with his car, but...

07:49.802 --> 07:51.387
[sighs] I think that...

07:52.221 --> 07:54.599
[exhales] I feel like we might be okay.

07:55.183 --> 07:56.058
I guess so.

07:56.893 --> 08:00.146
-Do you want to take a shower first?
-[Judy] No.

08:01.898 --> 08:04.066
Want to get out
of those dirty clothes or...

08:04.942 --> 08:06.027
[sighs]

08:06.319 --> 08:08.488
do you just want to stare
out the window weirdly?

08:09.489 --> 08:10.323
Yeah.

08:11.782 --> 08:12.825
[sighs]

08:13.534 --> 08:14.368
Okay.

08:18.498 --> 08:19.999
[Jen] <i>Hey. Is there power?</i>

08:20.541 --> 08:21.876
Yeah, it just came back on.

08:22.210 --> 08:23.169
Oh, well, that's good.

08:23.252 --> 08:26.839
Well, not fucking really. Now Henry,
Christopher, and Henry's weird friend

08:26.923 --> 08:28.925
are dancing around
to <i>Jesus Christ Superstar.</i>

08:29.008 --> 08:30.968
Okay, you know what? Language, Charlie.

08:31.677 --> 08:34.138
Don't denigrate <i>Jesus Christ Superstar.</i>
It's a great fucking show.

08:34.222 --> 08:36.474
Whatever. I don't even know
why Christopher's here.

08:36.557 --> 08:39.268
We would've been fine on our own.
Now they're driving me fucking crazy.

08:39.352 --> 08:41.312
You know what?
Why don't you go out for a walk

08:41.395 --> 08:44.106
and say "fuck" outside instead
of sitting there, moping around?

08:44.190 --> 08:46.275
<i>It's 100 degrees out.</i>
<i>I can't walk anywhere.</i>

08:46.359 --> 08:47.735
This is why I need a car.

08:47.818 --> 08:50.154
With climate change,
it's only getting more urgent.

08:50.238 --> 08:52.073
Oh, wow, well, thank you
for mansplaining to me

08:52.156 --> 08:54.242
why you are the most affected
by climate change.

08:54.784 --> 08:57.119
<i>Charlie, you're going to get a car</i>
<i>soon enough.</i>

08:57.203 --> 08:59.372
But for now, like I said,

08:59.455 --> 09:00.790
you're getting Dad's bike.

09:00.873 --> 09:02.250
Well, when is that gonna happen?

09:02.333 --> 09:04.335
Uh, when I have time to go
to the storage unit,

09:04.418 --> 09:06.587
<i>-which is a whole thing.</i>
<i>-</i>Whatever.

09:07.505 --> 09:08.631
Look, we, um... [sighs]

09:08.714 --> 09:11.008
...we'll be back tomorrow
from Judy's sick aunt's place.

09:11.092 --> 09:13.010
She was kind of touch-and-go here,

09:13.094 --> 09:15.388
-but I think she's gonna pull through.
-[Charlie] <i>Great.</i>

Hey, I just need to plug in my phone.
It's dying already.

09:39.036 --> 09:40.371
So, how are we?

09:43.124 --> 09:44.000
We're okay.

09:47.795 --> 09:48.754
Okay, yeah.

09:48.963 --> 09:50.089
[stuttering] I know...

09:51.090 --> 09:52.925
last night was a lot, but I...

09:53.426 --> 09:56.095
I just feel like we're
on the other side of it, Jude.

10:00.850 --> 10:02.476
Is there, um, anything

10:03.060 --> 10:05.646
I can get you or, just, like...

10:06.522 --> 10:10.192
Want me to get you a spa service,
like a nice massage or something?

10:11.110 --> 10:14.238
Oh, look at that.
TripAdvisor gives it almost three stars.

10:15.114 --> 10:16.532
Don't know why you would print that.

10:16.616 --> 10:17.617
No, thank you.

10:17.700 --> 10:19.201
You want a mani-pedi? No?

10:20.202 --> 10:22.747
I'm not really in the mood.
Sorry if that's bothering you.

10:23.164 --> 10:25.291
Jesus, Judy.
You're not bothering me. Okay?

10:27.418 --> 10:29.086
Are you mad at me?

10:29.837 --> 10:31.547
Because it's okay to be mad at me.

10:39.722 --> 10:40.640
No, I'm not.

10:43.559 --> 10:45.686
Okay, well, can you please
just tell me what to do here?

10:45.770 --> 10:48.856
Because you're the nice one
and I'm the shitty one,

10:48.939 --> 10:52.902
so just tell me how I can do
something nice for you.

10:54.820 --> 10:56.572
Because you're scaring me a little.

10:58.949 --> 11:01.243
I just don't really feel
like talking right now.

11:03.746 --> 11:04.580
Okay.

11:07.583 --> 11:09.418
I think I'm just really tired

11:10.086 --> 11:12.588
from six hours of digging a hole
in the forest

11:12.672 --> 11:15.257

in that hole.

11:18.678 --> 11:19.512

11:46.414 --> 11:47.331

11:47.498 --> 11:50.960
-Um, I, uh, have an idea.
-[groans]

11:51.085 --> 11:52.044
There's, uh...

11:52.128 --> 11:56.006
There's a bar down in the lobby called
Whispers and Winks,

11:56.090 --> 11:57.883
and I just thought maybe...

11:59.218 --> 12:00.386
we could go down and...

12:01.387 --> 12:02.471
do a toast to...

12:03.431 --> 12:04.265
to Steve.

12:05.933 --> 12:06.767
Really?

12:06.976 --> 12:11.021
Yeah. I mean, isn't that what people do
after a burial?

12:11.230 --> 12:12.064
Right?

12:13.023 --> 12:14.567

-Yeah?

12:26.203 --> 12:27.830
Did you say "Whiskers and Wings"?

12:28.038 --> 12:30.124
No, why would it be "Whiskers"?
No, it's "Whispers."

12:30.750 --> 12:33.043
-Oh.
-And "Winks," like psst! Psst! Psst!

[Jen] Hi.

12:50.978 --> 12:51.979
Hi. What can I get you?

12:52.354 --> 12:55.441
Uh, we'll get two double scotches. Okay.

12:55.900 --> 12:57.443
If you're with the wedding party,
it's open bar.

12:57.526 --> 12:58.486
Oh, we're actually--

12:58.569 --> 13:02.031
The bride is my second cousin, so, yeah,
we'll just get the Johnnie Walker Blue.

13:02.698 --> 13:03.532
Thank you.

13:06.327 --> 13:08.287
-It's pretty loud.
-It's a bar.

-[clinks]

13:22.510 --> 13:23.594
Um...

13:24.011 --> 13:27.181
Do you want to say something about him?

13:27.264 --> 13:30.100
This isn't really what I was imagining,
so I don't...

13:30.184 --> 13:31.101
Okay.

13:31.185 --> 13:32.603
I don't really know what to say.

13:33.521 --> 13:34.855
Well, um...

13:36.899 --> 13:39.068
He was very good-looking.

13:40.110 --> 13:42.571
-He was more than that.
-Right, of course.

13:42.655 --> 13:44.657
-You didn't really know him.
-No, I didn't.

13:45.741 --> 13:47.076
He was very thoughtful...

13:47.993 --> 13:48.953
and sweet.

13:49.829 --> 13:50.996
-Okay.
-He was.

13:51.080 --> 13:51.914
Okay.

13:51.997 --> 13:55.125
He used to always do these little things
for me to make me feel special.

13:55.209 --> 13:56.126
Aww.

13:56.794 --> 13:58.420
Even the way he proposed.

13:59.088 --> 14:00.339
Yeah? What, um...

14:01.048 --> 14:02.341
How did he propose?

14:02.800 --> 14:04.677
-With a flash mob.
-Oh.

14:04.760 --> 14:06.846
Aw, that's... that's so fun.

14:06.929 --> 14:08.889
I thought we were just going to the beach
for the day,

14:08.973 --> 14:11.934
but then 200 people jumped up...

14:12.601 --> 14:15.688
and did this whole choreographed thing
to Cyndi Lauper.

14:16.522 --> 14:17.857
That's very thoughtful.

14:19.358 --> 14:22.027
He really had a soft side
that he didn't show a lot of people.

14:22.611 --> 14:25.155
Mm-hmm. Okay.

14:25.614 --> 14:27.032
I know you didn't like him.

14:28.492 --> 14:29.910
You have every reason not to.

14:31.704 --> 14:32.872
I know who he was.

14:33.873 --> 14:34.707
I get it.

14:37.376 --> 14:38.502
But I loved him.

14:41.297 --> 14:43.215
He was the first person who ever...

14:44.258 --> 14:46.135
really made me feel loved.

14:48.220 --> 14:50.139
[voice breaking] He wasn't always perfect.

14:52.308 --> 14:53.726
But he was my person.

14:54.894 --> 14:55.811
No, I know.

14:56.562 --> 14:57.396
No, I--

14:57.938 --> 14:59.064
I know what you mean.

15:00.399 --> 15:03.027
-[sniffles, stammers]
-Hmm.

15:03.652 --> 15:04.486
What?

15:05.654 --> 15:07.156
-What?
-No...

15:07.990 --> 15:10.576
There's this thing I always wanted
to tell you, and I just never...

15:11.035 --> 15:13.203
never felt like it was the right time.

15:13.370 --> 15:15.539
-What?
-I don't know, just forget it.

15:15.623 --> 15:18.542
No, you can't tell me you have something
to tell me and then not tell me.

15:18.626 --> 15:20.461
-Yeah, I hate when people do that.
-It's annoying.

15:20.544 --> 15:21.545
-It is.
-So just tell me.

15:21.629 --> 15:22.463
Okay.

15:24.590 --> 15:26.634
The morning after we...

15:27.676 --> 15:28.594
hit Ted...

15:29.678 --> 15:30.930
I woke up, and...

15:31.889 --> 15:34.934
Steve wasn't in bed,
so I went looking around for him...

15:36.018 --> 15:38.479
and I found him at our favorite spot
by the beach.

15:39.563 --> 15:42.983
And he was just sitting on the wet sand.

15:44.693 --> 15:46.779
He was crying like a little kid.

15:49.990 --> 15:52.743
It's not that he didn't care
about what happened.

15:54.995 --> 15:57.748
He was gutted by it, but I just don't
think that he was able to...

15:58.248 --> 16:00.292
[sniffles] ...show his feelings, you know?

16:01.043 --> 16:02.086
-Mm-hmm.
-[sniffles]

16:02.920 --> 16:04.463
But I think he felt safe at the beach,

16:04.546 --> 16:06.632
and that's why I kind of wanted us
to take him there...

16:08.217 --> 16:09.510
and put him to rest.

16:11.261 --> 16:12.096
Yeah, I get it.

16:14.431 --> 16:15.641
I just wanted...

16:19.436 --> 16:20.771
[sobbing]

16:24.942 --> 16:26.110
I just...

16:28.153 --> 16:30.572
I just wanted to say goodbye to him.

16:32.408 --> 16:34.410
He always took such good care of me.

16:34.493 --> 16:36.954
I just wanted to do something for him,
too.

16:39.540 --> 16:40.624
[sniffles]

16:45.087 --> 16:46.547
What's wrong? Are you okay?

16:49.508 --> 16:51.385

16:52.011 --> 16:53.262
I'm so sorry.

16:54.388 --> 16:55.973
You deserve to say goodbye.

16:57.307 --> 16:59.101
I got to do it with Ted, and...

16:59.184 --> 17:00.936
Just, I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.

17:01.020 --> 17:02.563
-No, no, no.
-It's not fair.

17:02.646 --> 17:05.107
-Don't cry. I don't want you to feel bad.
-You don't have to take care of me.

17:05.190 --> 17:06.442
-I'm sorry.
-Don't take care of me.

17:06.525 --> 17:08.652
-I can do whatever I want.
-[crying]

17:12.489 --> 17:15.075
It's why Steve loved you. [sniffles]

17:15.492 --> 17:17.411
[shuddering breaths] Because you are...

21:06.890 --> 21:08.600
Everyone was having a fun time.

21:08.684 --> 21:12.104
Then I stepped in here for two minutes
to make lemon ricotta pancakes,

21:12.187 --> 21:13.480
and as I was grating the zest,

21:13.563 --> 21:17.234
I heard a scream, and I was too late.
The bird was already dead.

21:17.317 --> 21:18.568
Okay, but how?

21:19.111 --> 21:20.070
Um...

21:20.570 --> 21:21.655
The dog did it.

21:21.989 --> 21:24.574
Probably just animal instinct.

21:24.658 --> 21:25.909
-I am so sorry, Jen.
-Oh, God.

21:25.993 --> 21:28.370
I told Alan she needed
to be professionally trained.

21:28.453 --> 21:31.415
But you know what? This is not like her.
Adele is not aggressive.

21:31.498 --> 21:32.916
I mean, she is a snob.

21:33.000 --> 21:34.751
She won't wear synthetics.

21:34.835 --> 21:36.086
-It's okay. It's okay.
-[sniffles]

21:36.169 --> 21:38.046
It's okay, baby. It's okay to be sad.

21:39.047 --> 21:40.257
-[Jen sighs]
-I just...

21:40.924 --> 21:44.094
I just wish I knew it was the last time
I was gonna play with the bird.

21:45.095 --> 21:46.388
I would have said goodbye.

21:50.517 --> 21:51.810
You can still say goodbye.

21:54.646 --> 21:56.481
[shoveling]

21:58.150 --> 21:59.943
[Christopher] In your hands, O Lord,

22:00.610 --> 22:04.614
we humbly entrust our brothers, sisters,

22:05.115 --> 22:06.074
and birds.

22:06.992 --> 22:10.370
In this life, you embrace them
with your tender love.

22:10.829 --> 22:13.582
So now, deliver them from evil

22:13.665 --> 22:15.375
and bid them eternal rest.

22:16.293 --> 22:18.962
Let us find in you comfort in our sadness

22:19.046 --> 22:23.050
and the courage
to move through this together.

22:24.843 --> 22:25.886
Amen.

22:31.892 --> 22:33.435
Judy, would you mind singing something?

22:35.103 --> 22:36.104

It's regarding the bird.

Okay.
