- Oh, don't worry,

we talk about everything in here.

00:52.281 --> 00:54.800
- Oi!

You want something...
slimmer in the leg. Look.

01:40.281 --> 01:43.280

you deserve a bit of cheering up.

Ah, no! I wish. To be young again, eh?

04:39.281 --> 04:42.280
I-I think there's been a bit
of a misunderstanding.

04:42.281 --> 04:44.280
You see, Mr Amery thought
there was a break-in,

04:44.281 --> 04:46.957

Yes, it was me here all along.

- Thank you.

06:00.632 --> 06:02.671
So, what exactly led you to believe
there was a break-in

06:02.672 --> 06:06.353
in the first place? The locks are intact.

06:06.354 --> 06:10.370
Well, it was... it was just
that things were out of place, um...

06:10.371 --> 06:13.318
- my cup was broken...
- Oh, I'll get you a new one!

Oh, for heaven's sake,
are we still talking about this?!

06:21.632 --> 06:24.632
- Well, I thought so.
- I just stepped out to get some air.

06:27.558 --> 06:29.558
Is anyone else feeling warm?

06:34.632 --> 06:37.151
There, is that better?

06:37.152 --> 06:39.631
May I ask if you've been drinking,
Professor?

06:39.632 --> 06:43.152
Maybe last night. Not a crime now, is it?

06:44.212 --> 06:45.732
I'll be the judge of that.

06:47.218 --> 06:49.660

a bit more than normal?

Hear, hear!

07:44.632 --> 07:47.631
It's very kind, but I'm not sure
that's how it works.

07:47.632 --> 07:50.631
We'll see. The church council
can make things very difficult

07:50.632 --> 07:53.631
for the diocese, indeed. They still
have to send their candidate

07:53.632 --> 07:56.312
to the churchwardens for their consent.

07:56.313 --> 07:57.631
No harm in getting in early.

07:57.632 --> 08:00.631
And I can tell you,
she does not consent to much.

08:00.632 --> 08:02.632
No, I do not.

08:05.214 --> 08:08.631
Professor Simms, what exactly
were you working on last night?

08:08.632 --> 08:11.631
- Lytham's.
- Teashops.

08:11.632 --> 08:14.413
Processing their stocking and restocking.

08:14.414 --> 08:16.333
We mostly do research for the university,

08:16.334 --> 08:19.831
but work for local businesses
helps to keep UNIAC's lights on.

08:19.832 --> 08:23.155
- UNIAC?
- 'University Automatic Calculator.'

08:23.156 --> 08:25.631
- It's his baby.
- Maniac, more like.

08:25.632 --> 08:30.312
It's the future, Inspector. Imagine
one of these in every workplace.

08:31.431 --> 08:34.631
- Don't think it would fit.
- Not this one, it's old,

08:34.631 --> 08:37.631
but the newer ones are smaller.
More efficient.

08:37.631 --> 08:39.831
- More reliable.
- They're untested.

08:39.832 --> 08:42.912
And they can do much more
than stocking teashops.

08:42.913 --> 08:46.631
I-I-In the future,
they'll be able to do everything...

08:46.632 --> 08:49.631
maybe even your job, one day, Inspector.

08:49.632 --> 08:53.271
No need to look so threatened.
We're still a long way from that.

08:53.272 --> 08:55.631
- Not necessarily.
- Think of all the extra time

08:55.632 --> 08:58.631
you'll have to drink, dance and love.

08:58.632 --> 08:59.632
Off.

09:02.378 --> 09:05.631
- I doubt it's that easy.
- Everything is programmable,

09:05.632 --> 09:09.353
Inspector. Take one of your cases,
for example, your deduction

09:09.354 --> 09:12.452
would be based on a set
of probabilities, presuppositions,

09:12.453 --> 09:15.151
- and, of course, evidence.
- [CLATTERS]

09:15.152 --> 09:17.632

Yes or no?

09:21.992 --> 09:23.632

- Yes or no?
- Alex?

09:28.152 --> 09:31.631
Are they guilty? Yes or no?

09:31.632 --> 09:34.729
If you ask enough questions
in the right sequence, the program,

09:34.730 --> 09:37.631
and then you put the answers
together, then you have your result,

09:37.632 --> 09:39.631

[CLATTERS, THUD]

10:01.207 --> 10:03.991
Alex? Alex?

10:03.992 --> 10:05.632
Alex?

10:06.992 --> 10:08.820
Alex?

10:21.652 --> 10:23.651
Why the need for so much mercury?

10:23.652 --> 10:27.403
Electrical pulses move more slowly
through the mercury,

10:27.404 --> 10:30.491
meaning it can store data. Like a memory.

10:30.492 --> 10:33.651
Please, give me a minute. Please.

10:33.652 --> 10:35.651
He's my husband, I want to talk to him.

10:35.652 --> 10:37.127
He'll be fine.

10:37.128 --> 10:40.651
These mercury tanks,
do they break by themselves?

10:40.652 --> 10:42.651
It's possible,
they're temperature-sensitive.

10:42.652 --> 10:46.171
But not likely, they're
metal tubes inside a wooden box.

10:46.172 --> 10:48.652
So it must have been sabotage.

10:49.652 --> 10:53.295
- Who else has access to the Lab?
- Just the four of us.

10:53.296 --> 10:55.882
And would the professor
ever bring people back?

10:55.883 --> 10:58.325
Students. Clients, obviously.

10:58.326 --> 11:01.691
- But after hours?
- What are you getting at, Inspector?

11:01.692 --> 11:04.011
Professor Simms did admit
he spent the night there,

11:04.012 --> 11:07.652
which explains the prolonged
exposure to the mercury fumes.

11:08.517 --> 11:10.356
I just wondered if he was alone,

11:10.357 --> 11:13.516
because whoever was with him
could be a suspect.

11:13.517 --> 11:16.517
Are you saying someone could've
broken the tanks on purpose?

11:18.517 --> 11:19.843
No, Alex is a kind man.

11:19.844 --> 11:22.156
He is a wonderful husband and teacher,

11:22.157 --> 11:24.516
I can't imagine anyone
would want to hurt him.

11:24.517 --> 11:26.889
It's more likely he banged into
the box drunk

11:26.890 --> 11:29.300
and hadn't realised, knowing him.

11:33.517 --> 11:35.517
They said they did everything they could.

11:36.250 --> 11:37.940
I'm sorry.

12:02.389 --> 12:07.389
- What do you think you're doing?
- Oh, sorry, I was on my break...

12:07.414 --> 12:10.414
I wanted something new
to wear to dinner, but...

12:10.517 --> 12:12.516
I just thought, whilst it was quiet...

12:12.517 --> 12:15.517
No, it's fine, but... that?

12:16.517 --> 12:17.716
Too young?

12:17.717 --> 12:20.516
Colour brings out the flush
on your decolletage.

12:20.517 --> 12:22.516
- Flush?
- What we need is something

12:22.517 --> 12:25.806
- that plays to your strengths.
- An apron?

12:25.807 --> 12:27.557
- [HE LAUGHS]
- Come on.

12:29.517 --> 12:32.494
I think I saw, before, something
that might just be the thing.

12:32.519 --> 12:33.517
Ooh!

12:33.518 --> 12:35.516
These were the ones that were broken.

12:35.517 --> 12:38.333
A boot maybe, a hammer?

12:38.334 --> 12:41.517
Imagine, though,
a machine having a memory.

12:43.037 --> 12:46.516
- Can it remember who did it?
- Don't think so.

12:46.517 --> 12:48.517
Not much good to us, then, is it?

12:50.296 --> 12:52.220
Can I ask what it is
you're looking for, Guv?

12:52.841 --> 12:55.660
Clues, Larry. Evidence.

13:00.517 --> 13:02.780

13:13.296 --> 13:15.054
The Professor
didn't want us poking round,

13:15.079 --> 13:16.919
which suggests he's got
something to hide.

13:18.517 --> 13:21.517
Question is... what?

13:23.517 --> 13:26.516
And his wife might wanna believe
he was on his own last night...

13:26.517 --> 13:30.020
- [CLATTERS]
- I'm not so sure.

13:37.517 --> 13:39.877
So, the next question is who was he with?

13:50.517 --> 13:53.516
You see, the hourglass look
narrows your waist

13:53.517 --> 13:55.660
and makes the most of everything else.

13:56.517 --> 13:57.876
You think?

13:57.877 --> 14:00.516
They'll be putting you
in the window, dressed like that.

- It's your anniversary.

14:05.517 --> 14:07.516
Does he know how much his suit was yet?

14:07.517 --> 14:10.019
- I hid the receipt.
- [CHUCKLES]

14:10.020 --> 14:12.357
Then we've got two little secrets.

14:16.517 --> 14:20.984
Ooh! Nice suit. What is that? Italian?

14:20.985 --> 14:23.516
Well, haven't you heard?
I've gone part-time as a gigolo.

- Anything juicy?

14:26.331 --> 14:27.696
- Killer robot.
- What?

14:27.697 --> 14:29.517
Inspector thinks the victim
was having an affair.

14:30.397 --> 14:31.516
Oh, yeah?

14:31.517 --> 14:34.517
He was hiding something.
He's got previous.

14:35.517 --> 14:38.556
"Importuning. Arrested, but not charged."

14:38.557 --> 14:42.037
- How'd he manage that, then?
- Professor.

14:43.517 --> 14:45.517
The type with friends in high places.

14:46.517 --> 14:48.517
"Importuning"?

14:49.696 --> 14:51.696
For immoral purposes.

14:54.623 --> 14:57.623
On Jesus Green. After dark.

14:59.517 --> 15:01.839
He's a pansy, Larry!

15:01.840 --> 15:04.517
Oh! Oh, right.

15:04.900 --> 15:06.517
But he's married.

15:11.100 --> 15:15.540
- Hello and welcome, everyone.
- That's a bit too casual.

15:16.230 --> 15:17.660
What's wrong with the pulpit?

15:19.277 --> 15:21.277
Sidney never liked to use it.

15:21.302 --> 15:24.018
He said it put a barrier
between him and the congregation.

15:24.043 --> 15:27.032
Well, you're not Sidney
and you shouldn't try to be.

15:27.033 --> 15:30.516
You're wonderful as you are.
Now, come on.

15:30.517 --> 15:33.356
- I'll show...
- No. Not here.

15:33.357 --> 15:35.516
I told him you were busy, Mr Finch.

15:35.517 --> 15:39.876
That this wasn't a branch
of the local constabulary anymore.

15:39.877 --> 15:43.420
- You're here to see me?
- Thank you, Mrs Chapman.

15:47.037 --> 15:50.517
Well, I was just wondering whether
you knew anything about the Greeks.

15:51.517 --> 15:54.516
The Greeks?
He's a vicar, not a travel agent.

15:54.517 --> 15:58.516
As in literature.
It's for a case I'm working on.

15:58.517 --> 15:59.980
Oh, here we go.

16:01.517 --> 16:05.036
"To my Zeus, I'll be your Ganymede,"

16:05.037 --> 16:06.516
signed, "B".

16:06.517 --> 16:10.516
I've been led to believe
the victim associated with other men

16:10.517 --> 16:12.740
who had an interest in the Greeks.

16:13.197 --> 16:17.516
Well, Ganymede was said to be
the most beautiful of all mortals,

16:17.517 --> 16:22.517
so much so that Zeus abducted him
to be his cup-bearer.

16:24.876 --> 16:26.516
Right.

16:27.197 --> 16:29.876
And would you have any idea
where university men

16:29.877 --> 16:32.900
with such shared interests
might be likely to congregate?

16:36.436 --> 16:38.260
Maybe the classics department?

16:39.483 --> 16:42.643
I think the Inspector
means socially, where...

16:43.517 --> 16:45.517
men of the same interest...

16:48.210 --> 16:50.210
What's "same", again, in Greek?

16:50.517 --> 16:54.820
Homo. Oh! Oh... I see.

16:56.900 --> 16:59.517
What've you got against the Greeks?

16:59.900 --> 17:02.517
Well, I wouldn't really know.

17:04.029 --> 17:05.819
There is one place.

17:06.780 --> 17:09.517
Ganymede may have a double meaning.

17:10.517 --> 17:12.517
You know, you really didn't have to come.

17:13.099 --> 17:18.517
So, how would you and Sidney
play this? Do we... stake it out?

17:20.517 --> 17:22.516
I was just gonna go in
and ask a few questions.

17:22.517 --> 17:24.517
They won't talk to you as a policeman.

17:26.196 --> 17:27.516
So, what do you suggest?

17:27.517 --> 17:31.516
Actually, you'll be fine in that suit.

17:31.517 --> 17:34.557
INHALES: All right, follow my lead.

17:44.290 --> 17:47.290
Gentlemen, I don't believe
we've had the pleasure.

17:47.315 --> 17:49.492
We are as unversed as Artemisa herself.

17:49.517 --> 17:53.517
Ah, but you know your myths.
And that is a fabulous suit.

17:54.517 --> 17:57.516
If you please, sign the register,
and then follow me into the lounge.

17:57.517 --> 17:58.877
Thank you.

18:08.517 --> 18:10.516
"Sidney Chambers"?

18:10.517 --> 18:13.517
I didn't want to write my real name.

18:33.517 --> 18:35.516
Same handwriting.

18:35.517 --> 18:37.516
So, we're looking for a Robert Hazelwood,

18:37.517 --> 18:39.196
if that's his real name.

18:39.197 --> 18:44.516
- He was in last night.
- Ingenious. Elementary, even!

18:44.517 --> 18:45.820
After you.

18:48.896 --> 18:50.896
Oh, come on, it's hardly gonna be
Sodom and Gomorrah.

18:53.837 --> 18:54.837
Is it?

19:02.037 --> 19:07.196
Tom Collins.
Everybody's drinking them stateside.

19:07.197 --> 19:09.516
Oh! [LAUGHS]

19:09.517 --> 19:11.517
"Stateside."

19:15.517 --> 19:17.197
Ooh.

19:19.123 --> 19:22.340
So, come on then, why ain't you married?

19:23.037 --> 19:25.988
Well, you say all the right things,
you know your drinks

19:25.989 --> 19:27.516
- from your dresses...
- [HE LAUGHS]

19:27.517 --> 19:29.516
Just not found the right girl?

19:29.517 --> 19:31.700
How do you think I keep my finger
on the pulse?

19:33.260 --> 19:35.876
By staying single. Free and easy.

19:35.877 --> 19:37.716
No house to run.

19:37.717 --> 19:40.516
No kids turning me grey.

19:40.517 --> 19:43.516
It doesn't sound much,
I'll give you that, but...

19:43.517 --> 19:45.877
I wouldn't swap it for the world.

19:47.717 --> 19:51.516
Ooh, it's gone straight to my head!

19:51.517 --> 19:52.517
[CHATTER]

19:56.517 --> 19:58.716
- Are you all right?
- I shouldn't have come.

19:58.717 --> 20:00.517
It's practically Dionysian.

20:01.517 --> 20:04.516
- Is that near Athens?
- It means debauched, frenzied.

20:04.517 --> 20:06.516
I wouldn't go that far.

20:06.517 --> 20:11.516
Look more like business types
to me... academics, lawyers.

20:11.517 --> 20:14.166
Probably how Simms got off
his importuning charge.

20:14.167 --> 20:17.793
Gentlemen. This is your boy.
He will fetch you your drinks.

20:17.794 --> 20:20.787
Actually, we're looking for
a friend of ours, Robert Hazelwood.

20:20.788 --> 20:21.795
Right.

20:21.820 --> 20:23.516
You wouldn't happen to know
where we might find him?

20:23.517 --> 20:27.988
We do not make introductions.
We do not hold information.

20:27.989 --> 20:32.036
We are simply an Ancient
Greek-inspired drinking club.

20:32.037 --> 20:33.860
That is all.

20:34.517 --> 20:37.877
Now... what would you like?

20:38.613 --> 20:40.253
Do you do pints?

20:40.278 --> 20:42.517
Something stiff. Large.

20:46.517 --> 20:47.900
Mrs Simms?

20:49.517 --> 20:50.517
Oi!

20:51.717 --> 20:53.740
Efcharisto!

20:57.517 --> 21:00.913
Mrs Simms! Mrs Simms!

21:00.914 --> 21:02.516
Stop!

21:02.517 --> 21:04.516
I'll cut her off!

21:04.517 --> 21:06.517
- [BICYCLE BELL RINGS]
- Argh!

21:08.357 --> 21:09.980
I'm terribly sorry.

21:10.517 --> 21:12.517
Sorry!

21:13.517 --> 21:17.516
I know your name. I know where you work.

21:17.517 --> 21:20.517
It's not going to be difficult
to find your address.

21:22.416 --> 21:26.256
- [PANTING]
- That's right... turn around.

21:29.700 --> 21:31.517
Sorry.

21:32.517 --> 21:34.516
It's been a trying time.

21:34.517 --> 21:37.020
Stop, police!

21:37.683 --> 21:39.683
Thank you, Leonard!

21:42.263 --> 21:44.263
- Watch your step, Mrs Keating.
- Oh, I will!

21:44.517 --> 21:47.037
It can go straight to your head.
Why do you think I drink them?

21:48.416 --> 21:52.340
I've got you an anniversary present.

21:52.365 --> 21:56.365
Oh, Anthony! You shouldn't have.

21:56.517 --> 21:58.517
- Not at all.
- [SHE LAUGHS]

21:59.517 --> 22:01.517
It's the least I can do.

22:04.517 --> 22:06.517
Anthony?!

22:07.517 --> 22:10.516
[GRUNTS] No!

22:10.517 --> 22:12.517
Yes!

22:14.557 --> 22:16.517
[GRUNTS]

22:18.517 --> 22:20.517
SHOUTS: No!

22:23.517 --> 22:25.516
Go on, then, tell him!

22:25.517 --> 22:28.517
Tell him what you were doing
on your anniversary!

22:34.930 --> 22:36.740
What were you doing there, Jean?

22:39.500 --> 22:41.249
I just fancied a drink.

22:41.250 --> 22:43.780
Then why did you run when you saw us?

22:45.540 --> 22:48.250
You knew about your husband's...

22:49.290 --> 22:51.249
...proclivities?

22:51.250 --> 22:54.780
I knew what Alex was,
if that's what you mean?

22:56.250 --> 23:00.249
- Why didn't you tell me?
- Why do you think?

23:00.250 --> 23:02.500
It'd ruin his reputation...

23:03.500 --> 23:07.249
- ...tarnish his work, our work.
- What were you doing at the Ganymede?

23:07.250 --> 23:09.668
Much the same as you,
I'd imagine, Inspector.

23:09.669 --> 23:11.621
I was looking for the man
he was with last night.

23:11.622 --> 23:13.250
You know who "B" is.

23:14.660 --> 23:17.249
This is the man
that could've killed your husband.

23:17.250 --> 23:18.250
No.

23:21.549 --> 23:23.389
I don't think that.

23:24.589 --> 23:25.700
Because they were in love.

23:27.109 --> 23:28.109
They were happy.

23:28.580 --> 23:30.940
I just thought
he might've seen something.

23:32.250 --> 23:33.250
Perhaps he could help.

23:33.251 --> 23:36.250
I could go back to the Ganymede
with a warrant.

23:37.250 --> 23:40.249
Start arresting people for
gross indecency until I find him.

23:40.250 --> 23:41.250
Inspector.

23:41.251 --> 23:46.250
If you think this man could help
find out the truth about Alex,

23:46.540 --> 23:51.380
then let us help find him.
It's what the Inspector does best.

24:02.250 --> 24:03.250
Bobby Guthrie.

24:05.090 --> 24:08.250
He and Alex have been seeing
each other for well over a year now.

24:18.860 --> 24:20.250
"Robert Hazelwood".

24:21.250 --> 24:23.620
Didn't work very hard
on his alias, did he?

24:25.250 --> 24:27.250
And the bastard's got kids.

24:37.250 --> 24:38.460
Mrs Guthrie?

24:40.090 --> 24:43.610
- Is your husband home?
- Is everything all right?

24:43.940 --> 24:46.249
He came home ill this morning,

24:46.250 --> 24:48.700
I don't know what's the matter with him.

24:55.540 --> 24:57.250
[WHEEZING]

25:02.700 --> 25:06.249
It's mercury poisoning.
Call an ambulance!

25:06.250 --> 25:07.340
Now!

25:23.250 --> 25:24.250
Ma'am.

25:28.250 --> 25:30.512
Inspector. You found Bobby?

25:30.537 --> 25:31.671
- Yes.
- OK.

25:31.672 --> 25:34.250
He was ill. Just like Alex.

25:34.900 --> 25:38.084
- But maybe you knew that already.
- I beg your pardon?

25:38.085 --> 25:41.249
Wife discovers husband
is having affairs with men.

25:41.250 --> 25:44.509
Man, not men. Just Bobby.

25:44.510 --> 25:46.240
And they're both poisoned in your lab.

25:46.265 --> 25:47.486
That's preposterous!

25:47.487 --> 25:50.563
You had reason,
access to the murder weapon...

25:50.564 --> 25:52.529
I told you, he was my husband,

25:52.530 --> 25:55.249
maybe not in the traditional sense,
but I loved him.

25:55.250 --> 25:59.249
You're not wearing a wedding ring?
I misplaced it.

25:59.250 --> 26:01.697
And you're back at work the day he died.

26:01.698 --> 26:05.385
It's what he lived for,
this computer, it is him,

26:05.386 --> 26:08.582
so please don't tell me
how I'm supposed to feel.

26:08.583 --> 26:10.500
Mrs Simms left with me last night.

26:13.820 --> 26:15.250
Hush now.

26:16.574 --> 26:19.186
I can assure you she did not touch
the mercury tanks.

26:19.187 --> 26:21.934
And she had no reason
to be jealous of Alex and Bobby.

26:23.488 --> 26:24.688
And how's that?

26:26.574 --> 26:28.574
Think of your reputation.

26:31.081 --> 26:32.574
I'm waiting.

26:33.900 --> 26:36.574
- Geordie.
- We knew about Bobby...

26:37.100 --> 26:39.260
just like Alex knew about us.

26:49.614 --> 26:53.573
Apparently, it's not illegal
because Queen Victoria

26:53.574 --> 26:58.060
couldn't imagine what two women
would... get up to together.

26:58.574 --> 27:01.574
And no one
had the constitution to explain.

27:02.100 --> 27:04.574
Queen Victoria's not the only one.

27:05.574 --> 27:08.573
I'm speaking with Bobby
once the doctors are done with him.

27:08.574 --> 27:10.573
Just because he's ill,
doesn't make him innocent.

27:10.574 --> 27:13.573
And if it wasn't him,
then perhaps he could help

27:13.574 --> 27:16.573
shed some light on the ladies.

27:16.574 --> 27:19.573
I suppose them being together
could be seen to make them more,

27:19.574 --> 27:23.574
not less likely to want Alex
out of the way.

Oh, we'll make a Detective
of you yet, Leonard.

but Mrs Chapman seems quite certain.

as the prospective new Vicar
of Grantchester.

- Did he now?
- It's a real pleasure,

- I've heard so much about you.
- Well, you can tell the Archdeacon

been taken, thank you very much.

Did you happen to catch a name?

30:09.776 --> 30:14.500
Nope, just some wet-behind-the-ears
novice, not a patch on you.

30:15.574 --> 30:17.060
Chew your food.

30:17.574 --> 30:20.574
I'm meeting Inspector Keating at nine.

30:21.614 --> 30:25.020
Have an extra sausage
if you're fighting crimes.

30:39.254 --> 30:40.860
How was your dinner?

30:43.154 --> 30:45.154
Well, put it this way, Leonard...

30:45.508 --> 30:47.868
you're better off with Greeks than women.

30:48.774 --> 30:52.093
- Hello?
- Mrs Guthrie.

30:52.094 --> 30:54.573
We understand your husband
discharged himself from hospital.

30:54.574 --> 30:55.574
Mm.

31:09.374 --> 31:11.374
I need to know what happened at the lab.

31:11.399 --> 31:14.399
I'm... I'm sorry, I-I don't know
what you're talking about.

31:17.214 --> 31:20.214
The Cambridge Mathematical
Laboratory where you...

31:20.241 --> 31:22.460
spent the night
with Professor Alex Simms.

31:25.574 --> 31:27.100
Don't play silly buggers.

31:27.774 --> 31:30.573
You've just had treatment for the
mercury you were exposed to there.

31:30.574 --> 31:32.820
I don't know how that happened.

31:36.327 --> 31:41.327
I understand some things
are difficult to talk about,

31:41.574 --> 31:45.573
but Mrs Simms told us
about your relationship with Alex.

31:45.574 --> 31:49.573
And if you cared for him,
as I believe you did,

31:49.574 --> 31:53.540
then I'm sure you'd want to help
find out what happened.

31:55.574 --> 31:58.574
It's either that or you had
something to do with it yourself.

32:01.934 --> 32:04.180
I don't know a Professor Alex Simms.

32:10.774 --> 32:13.573
These are the clothes
you were wearing yesterday,

32:13.574 --> 32:17.574
- let's have a look, shall we?
- Excuse me?!

32:31.774 --> 32:32.896
What's this?

32:32.921 --> 32:34.598
I've... I've never seen
it in my life before.

32:35.574 --> 32:36.928
What's on it?

32:36.929 --> 32:39.094
Have you pieced together
what happened yet?

32:40.574 --> 32:41.900
Mr Guthrie?

32:42.614 --> 32:45.573
- I don't know.
- What's that?

32:45.574 --> 32:48.573
That is evidence in a murder enquiry.

32:48.574 --> 32:49.574
Murder?

32:49.575 --> 32:51.573
He... he must've placed it there himself.

32:51.574 --> 32:53.573
Inspector Keating wouldn't do that.

32:53.574 --> 32:55.573
I've been stood here the entire time.

32:55.574 --> 33:00.573
All right, I've had enough
of secrets and codes!

33:00.574 --> 33:03.737
- What's on it?
- Ring the solicitor, will you?

33:03.738 --> 33:06.573
- Mr Guthrie, this is futile.
- Did you steal it from the lab?

33:06.574 --> 33:09.299
- Tell him it's urgent.
- Or did he give it to you?

33:09.300 --> 33:12.414
- Who?
- Professor Alex Simms.

33:15.301 --> 33:18.301
For the last time, Mr Guthrie,
what's on this tape?

33:18.747 --> 33:21.427
- Who's Alex Simms?
- Geordie!

33:24.774 --> 33:27.574
He's the man your husband
was having an affair with.

33:48.574 --> 33:50.574
Ah, don't look at me like that.

33:53.574 --> 33:57.933
I suppose he was just doing his job,
but that's the difference, isn't it?

33:57.934 --> 34:00.573
A clergyman counsels, keeps confidences,

34:00.574 --> 34:04.740
a detective has to rip them apart.

34:05.774 --> 34:07.574
You're just kind, that's all.

34:09.481 --> 34:11.481
You always look for the best in people.

34:13.087 --> 34:16.860
And I'm very lucky you do...
for my sake, at least.

34:18.087 --> 34:20.407
The Archdeacon rang to arrange...

34:33.574 --> 34:36.574
Mrs C! Mrs C, please!

34:37.574 --> 34:41.940
- Leonard.
- Go. Just go, please.

35:01.427 --> 35:03.060
Where are the others?

35:03.427 --> 35:06.660
They're at lunch.
They always eat together.

35:10.900 --> 35:13.020
It is work.

35:13.021 --> 35:16.267
I managed to program her
to play noughts and crosses.

35:16.960 --> 35:19.120
Can you tell me what's on this?

35:20.467 --> 35:22.427
Is it to do with the case?

35:23.427 --> 35:24.427
Possibly.

35:26.313 --> 35:30.660
Well, first,
you thread it into the reader here.

35:36.107 --> 35:38.426
The code goes through
the new thermionic valves,

35:38.427 --> 35:41.426
and, once processed,
its contents are displayed

35:41.427 --> 35:44.427
via cathode ray tube display there.

35:49.427 --> 35:52.427
Do you really think
Mrs Simms could've done it?

35:54.580 --> 35:57.260
It was all happy families
if I listened to them.

35:58.427 --> 36:01.427
- What do you think?
- I don't know.

36:03.427 --> 36:06.426
- They did argue.
- About what?

36:06.427 --> 36:08.107
I tried not to listen.

36:09.427 --> 36:10.787
It was all so complicated.

36:12.427 --> 36:13.789
Not like this old girl.

36:13.790 --> 36:15.740
[TAPS, BUZZES]

36:25.427 --> 36:28.426
I had received your letter
this morning, Mrs Chapman,

36:28.427 --> 36:31.997
and I must say it is no surprise
that Mr Finch has been doing

36:31.998 --> 36:34.426
- such an admirable job.
- Thank you.

36:34.427 --> 36:39.426
But as Mr Finch is aware, it is only
in exceptional circumstances

36:39.427 --> 36:42.128
that a curate is promoted
within his own parish.

36:42.129 --> 36:44.426
For example, if he had a family

36:44.427 --> 36:46.426
that was comfortably settled in the area.

36:46.427 --> 36:49.426
It's a shame your engagement
to Miss Franklin fell through,

36:49.427 --> 36:51.466
- isn't it?
- Now, I am willing to listen

36:51.467 --> 36:56.426
to any objections to Mr Davenport's
appointment specifically, but...

36:56.427 --> 36:58.426
I cannot guarantee that that will result

36:58.427 --> 37:00.426
in Mr Finch getting the job.

37:00.427 --> 37:02.427
No objections from me.

37:03.780 --> 37:05.460
Mrs Chapman?

37:09.094 --> 37:11.466
- Well...
- May I say something?

37:11.467 --> 37:14.426
I mean, don't get me wrong,
I want this position.

37:14.427 --> 37:17.106
Who wouldn't? Stunning here,

37:17.107 --> 37:19.626
but I know that Leonard
is doing fantastic work.

37:19.627 --> 37:23.266
And it's clear that he has
the support of the parish.

37:23.267 --> 37:25.426
So I think it's only right
that he gets the job.

37:25.427 --> 37:27.426
I'm afraid it's not your decision
to make.

37:27.427 --> 37:30.466
Why not? He's a good man, he's ready.

37:30.467 --> 37:33.426
I'm happy to step back
and wait my turn elsewhere.

37:33.427 --> 37:36.427
No, no, I'm not...

37:37.787 --> 37:39.426
...ready.

37:39.427 --> 37:43.426
I've enjoyed standing in,
but, as the Archdeacon says,

37:43.427 --> 37:47.820
it's not right for me to take
the position permanently. Thank you.

37:52.427 --> 37:53.947
Well...

37:56.386 --> 37:58.386
...if there are no further objections...

38:00.467 --> 38:05.426
I would like to welcome Mr Davenport
as new Vicar of Grantchester.

38:05.427 --> 38:07.427
[APPLAUSE]

38:18.193 --> 38:19.380
Leonard.

38:20.267 --> 38:21.340
Will?

38:22.027 --> 38:24.867
Er, sorry to interrupt. Er,
Mrs C told me you were down here.

38:25.267 --> 38:28.426
Will's bidding farewell
to the city centre.

38:28.427 --> 38:31.107
He's going to be the new vicar
of Grantchester.

38:35.307 --> 38:36.580
Cheers!

38:38.427 --> 38:40.426
Are you sure you're happy about this?

38:40.427 --> 38:42.060
Of course I am!

38:42.427 --> 38:44.427
I've only been doing it a few weeks
and I'm exhausted.

38:45.260 --> 38:47.750
I'd much rather be in the background,

38:47.751 --> 38:49.426
the man behind the man,

38:49.427 --> 38:52.427
let you take the flak.
You'll be marvellous.

38:52.860 --> 38:54.427
Thanks.

38:54.914 --> 38:56.274
Right.

38:57.166 --> 39:00.166
Well, er, I just came down
to apologise for earlier.

39:00.191 --> 39:01.674
I was just trying to get
moving on this case...

39:01.699 --> 39:02.787
I understand.

39:02.812 --> 39:06.106
...and I wondered if you'd look
at one last thing for me.

39:06.107 --> 39:08.426
It's called a "print out".

39:08.427 --> 39:10.184
That's Greek, isn't it?

39:10.185 --> 39:12.427
"Two bodies, one soul."

39:13.787 --> 39:15.947
It's Aristotle's definition of love.

39:18.193 --> 39:20.193
Not what you were expecting?

39:23.267 --> 39:25.426
Do you ever feel
you have no idea what you're doing?

39:25.427 --> 39:28.087
Most Sundays. [CHUCKLES]

39:28.088 --> 39:29.660
You know who'd love this?

39:30.427 --> 39:31.660
Sidney.

39:32.740 --> 39:34.580
Secrets, affairs...

39:35.427 --> 39:38.380
"Modern relationships".
Right up his street.

39:40.260 --> 39:42.860
He'd love it if he knew
I was struggling without him.

39:44.107 --> 39:45.267
He wouldn't.

39:46.787 --> 39:50.426
And you were solving crimes
long before Sidney came along.

39:50.427 --> 39:53.427
And I've seen you in action... today.

39:55.129 --> 39:56.426
I know it's not the same,

39:56.427 --> 39:59.786
but when I'm struggling,
I try to go back to basics.

39:59.787 --> 40:03.427
Actually listening, thinking
before I speak, for a change.

40:03.919 --> 40:04.919
What do you normally do?

40:05.427 --> 40:10.980
I dunno. I ask questions...
gather evidence.

40:12.427 --> 40:14.500
Old-fashioned detective work.

40:22.140 --> 40:23.947
Bloody vicars.

40:27.427 --> 40:32.427
- Just this one?
- For now. If you could stand back.

40:33.947 --> 40:37.426
May we ask what it is
you're looking for, Inspector?

40:37.427 --> 40:39.427
It's a murder weapon.

40:43.607 --> 40:45.607
Same as any other.

40:54.267 --> 40:55.820
My ring?!

40:56.787 --> 41:00.427
Wha...? I don't know how it got there.

41:03.427 --> 41:07.426
You don't seriously think
I'd brake a metal pipe

41:07.427 --> 41:09.641
with my bare hands
and not notice my wedding ring

41:09.642 --> 41:10.775
had fallen off?!

41:10.776 --> 41:13.426
That would be the easy answer,
wouldn't it?

41:13.427 --> 41:17.106
- Jealous wife, things to hide.
- I told you, I wasn't jealous.

41:17.107 --> 41:19.427
But that's what you assumed I'd think...

41:21.427 --> 41:22.467
...isn't it, Mr Amery?

41:24.427 --> 41:27.426
I-I don't know what you're talking about.

...sent me on a trail of secrets.

41:40.427 --> 41:45.426
- No.
- ..as if you were programming me.

41:45.427 --> 41:47.427
Because what? You wanted a new computer?

41:49.280 --> 41:52.280
- Don't tell me that's it?!
- Or because...

41:53.947 --> 41:57.427
...they were all together,
you were the odd one out?

41:58.740 --> 42:01.426
- Because you were in the way!
- That's it, isn't it?

42:01.427 --> 42:06.072
Alex, you... so, so caught up
in your tawdry little affairs

42:06.073 --> 42:08.426
- that you forgot why we were here.
- They were happy.

We're supposed to be the future,
the forefront,

42:11.427 --> 42:14.426

- He took you under his wing.
- You're all alone, just background.

- Shut up!
- Hey!
