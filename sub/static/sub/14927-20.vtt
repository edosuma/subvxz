WEBVTT

00:04.638 --> 00:05.539
CLAUDIA,
THAT WAS DELICIOUS.

00:05.573 --> 00:06.540
OH, THANKS, MOM.

00:06.574 --> 00:08.809
YOU'VE REALLY TURNED
INTO QUITE THE LITTLE COOK.

00:08.842 --> 00:09.610
YOU SHOULD TRY
HER LASAGNA.

00:09.643 --> 00:11.679
WHY? THERE'S NOTHING
WRONG WITH THIS.

00:11.712 --> 00:13.247
I'M NOT SAYING
THERE IS.

00:13.281 --> 00:15.149
DON'T--DON'T LISTEN
TO HIM.

00:15.183 --> 00:16.350
THIS WAS VERY GOOD.

00:16.384 --> 00:17.518
OH, THANKS, DAD.

00:17.551 --> 00:19.687
YOU'LL HAVE TO WRITE
THE RECIPE DOWN FOR ME
BEFORE WE GO.

00:19.720 --> 00:23.091
THAT'S RIGHT.
YOU GUYS ARE TAKING OFF
TOMORROW, AREN'T YOU?

00:23.124 --> 00:25.326
OH, THIS WEEK
HAS JUST FLOWN BY.

00:25.359 --> 00:25.926
HASN'T IT?

00:25.959 --> 00:27.328
SEAN, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

00:27.361 --> 00:28.496
LOADING UP
THE DISHWASHER.

00:28.529 --> 00:30.098
DON'T YOU WANNA
RINSE 'EM FIRST?

00:30.131 --> 00:33.234
NAW, NO NEED TO.
IT'S ONE OF THOSE
NEW MACHINES.

00:33.267 --> 00:34.502
YOU DON'T
HAVE TO RINSE.

00:34.535 --> 00:36.604
JUST LEAVE 'EM
ON THE COUNTER. CLAUDIA
AND I CAN DO 'EM LATER.

00:36.637 --> 00:38.739
YOU REALLY
DON'T HAVE TO DO THAT.
IT'S NOT NECESSARY.

00:38.772 --> 00:39.773
WE'LL BE HAPPY TO.

00:39.807 --> 00:40.641
I'M NOT QUESTIONING THAT.

00:40.674 --> 00:42.110
IT'S JUST, YOU KNOW,
IT'S A NEW MACHINE.

00:42.143 --> 00:45.846
IT SAID THAT YOU DON'T
HAVE TO RINSE--RIGHT THERE,
A BIG SIGN IN THE STORE.

00:45.879 --> 00:48.082
WELL, UH,
THAT'S WHAT THEY SAY,

00:48.116 --> 00:50.451
BUT AT HOME,
WE ALWAYS PREWASH.

00:50.484 --> 00:52.153
OK, WELL, SEE,
THIS IS MY HOME,

00:52.186 --> 00:54.355
AND I'VE USED
THIS MACHINE MANY,
MANY TIMES,

00:54.388 --> 00:55.856
AND I KINDA KNOW
ITS CAPABILITIES.

00:55.889 --> 00:59.127
I SEE. BUT JUST
TO BE ON THE SAFE SIDE,
YOU'RE GONNA WANT--

00:59.160 --> 01:01.529
OH, NO SAFE SIDE.
NO DAN YOU KNOW?

01:01.562 --> 01:02.796
JUST DIRTY PLATES
GETTIN' CLEAN.

01:02.830 --> 01:03.797
HEY, I HAVE AN IDEA.

01:03.831 --> 01:06.467
TAKE MY DAD AND GO UPSTAIRS
AND WATCH THE NEWS.

01:06.500 --> 01:08.136
MOM AND I'LL FINISH UP.

01:08.169 --> 01:09.036
OH, YEAH, AS SOON AS

01:09.069 --> 01:11.639
HE PUTS THAT PLATE
UNRINSED RIGHT IN THERE,

01:11.672 --> 01:12.440
I'LL BE HAPPY TO.

01:12.473 --> 01:14.375
LOOK, WE'RE ONLY HERE
ONE MORE DAY.

01:14.408 --> 01:16.644
I GUESS WE CAN USE
PAPER PLATES IN THE MORNING.

01:16.677 --> 01:22.183
LOOK, OK, THESE
DISHES ARE GONNA BE
CLEAN IN THE MORNING.

01:22.216 --> 01:24.118
THAT'S WHY I BOUGHT
THE DISHWASHER, OK?

01:24.152 --> 01:27.255
TO WASH THE DISHES
FOR ME SO YOU DON'T
HAVE TO WASH THE DISHES

01:27.288 --> 01:29.223
BEFORE YOU WASH
THE DISHES, OK?

01:29.257 --> 01:31.425
EVERYTHING
GOES RIGHT IN THERE,
NO RINSING.

01:31.459 --> 01:32.460
I'M GOING UPSTAIRS,

01:32.493 --> 01:37.097
AND NO ONE
HAD BETTER TOUCH
THAT DAMN DISHWASHER!

01:53.814 --> 01:55.683
Claudia: SEAN!

01:55.716 --> 01:56.517
OH!

01:56.550 --> 01:58.752
WHAT THE HELL
WAS THAT ABOUT?
WHAT?

01:58.786 --> 02:00.754
YOU, SCREAMING
AT MY PARENTS!

02:00.788 --> 02:02.690
BABY, I WAS DEFENDING
OUR DISHWASHER!

02:02.723 --> 02:04.758
THEY ARE DOWNSTAIRS
IN SHOCK.

02:04.792 --> 02:07.528
YOU WERE TOTALLY INSANE.

02:07.561 --> 02:08.796
OK, I WAS NOT INSANE.

02:08.829 --> 02:11.799
WHAT YOU SAW DOWN THERE
WAS THE RESULT
OF AMAZING SELF-CONTROL.

02:11.832 --> 02:12.633
WHAT?!

02:12.666 --> 02:13.734
ALL WEEK, I'VE BEEN
HOLDING IT IN, OK,

02:13.767 --> 02:16.570
JUST GRINNING
AND BEARING IT WHILE
THE PUSH ME CLOSER

02:16.604 --> 02:18.772
AND CLOSER
TO THE EDGE!

02:18.806 --> 02:19.840
OH, MY GOD!

02:19.873 --> 02:22.210
WHAT DO YOU HAVE
IN THERE?

02:22.243 --> 02:24.678
CANNED VEGETABLES.

02:24.712 --> 02:26.247
FOR THE CHILDREN.

02:26.280 --> 02:28.716
THAT'S NICE OF YOU.

02:28.749 --> 02:30.251
SO--AHEM.

02:30.284 --> 02:32.353
YOU THINK MY CAR'LL
BE SAFE HERE?

02:32.386 --> 02:35.356
OH, YEAH, YEAH.
I PARK OUT ON THE STREET
ALL THE TIME.

02:35.389 --> 02:38.726
OH! WHAT ABOUT
A SLIGHTLY MORE
DESIRABLE CAR?

02:38.759 --> 02:41.295
HA HA HA HA!

02:41.762 --> 02:43.264
AAH!

02:43.297 --> 02:45.633
AAH...UGH!

02:46.800 --> 02:48.702
YOU OK,
POP

02:48.736 --> 02:49.837
OH, I'M FINE, FINE.

02:49.870 --> 02:52.740
YOUR PARENTS' MATTRESS
HASN'T BEEN FLIPPED
FOR A WHILE.

02:52.773 --> 02:54.608
ALL THOSE--THOSE SOFT SPOTS

02:54.642 --> 02:57.511
HAVE WREAKED HAVOC
ON MY NECK.

02:57.545 --> 02:59.513
AH!

03:06.019 --> 03:10.424
AAAAAAAH...

03:10.458 --> 03:11.359
AH!

03:11.392 --> 03:13.261
GUESS I'D BETTER
GO FLIP THAT MATTRESS, HUH?

03:13.294 --> 03:15.763
OH, SEAN,
THAT ISN'T NECESSARY.

03:15.796 --> 03:19.800
AAHHHH!

03:23.571 --> 03:24.638
WHAT THE HELL?

03:24.672 --> 03:26.974
I PUT IN SOME
HALOGEN BULBS.

03:27.007 --> 03:29.677
IT WAS LIKE
A TOMB IN HERE!

03:29.710 --> 03:30.711
UH...

03:30.744 --> 03:33.247
LOOK, THAT LAMPSHADE'S
SMOKING.

03:33.281 --> 03:33.914
NO.

03:33.947 --> 03:37.351
JUST THE DIRT
BURNING OFF.

03:37.818 --> 03:40.488
COME ON. HE WAS
JUST BEING HELPFUL.

03:40.521 --> 03:42.022
BABY, HE WASN'T.
HE WASN'T SAYING

03:42.055 --> 03:43.591
OUR HOUSE
ISN'T BRIGHT ENOUGH.

03:43.624 --> 03:45.859
HE'S SAYING
I'M NOT BRIGHT ENOUGH,
YOU KNOW?

03:45.893 --> 03:48.629
EVERYTHING HE SAYS
HAS THAT TINGE OF
"YOU STINK" TO IT.

03:48.662 --> 03:49.863
GOD, HE JUST
HATES MY GUTS!

03:49.897 --> 03:50.698
HEY, HE DOESN'T
HATE YOUR GUTS.

03:50.731 --> 03:53.000
CAN HE BE A LITTLE
ABRASIVE? YEAH! OK.

03:53.033 --> 03:56.537
BUT INSIDE,
HE REALLY IS
THE SWEETEST MAN.

03:56.570 --> 03:59.473
WAY, WAY, WAY
DEEP INSIDE.

03:59.507 --> 04:01.575
HE JUST WANTS
TO SEE US HAPPY.

04:01.609 --> 04:03.877
HE BROUGHT US
ALL THOSE GIFTS.

04:03.911 --> 04:05.279
IT'S A MAILBOX!

04:05.313 --> 04:06.947
YEAH, A REAL BIG
MAILBOX.

04:06.980 --> 04:09.049
IT'S A KARAOKE MACHINE!

04:09.082 --> 04:11.585
A GAMEBOY ADVANCE!

04:11.619 --> 04:12.586
A PAINT SET!

04:12.620 --> 04:15.889
NOW, WHO WANTS
TO GIVE POP-POP
A BIG KISS, HUH?

04:15.923 --> 04:17.991
WHO WANTS TO
DO THAT?

04:18.025 --> 04:18.726
OH!

04:18.759 --> 04:21.829
THOSE ARE POP-POP'S
GOODS THERE.

04:21.862 --> 04:23.697
WAKE UP, CLAUDIA.

04:23.731 --> 04:24.965

THE KIDS HAPPY.

04:24.998 --> 04:25.666
OH, YEAH, YEAH,
YEAH, YEAH.

04:25.699 --> 04:28.502
HE MADE THE KIDS HAPPY.

04:28.536 --> 04:30.371
Lily, singing:
* SUMMER LOVIN'

04:30.404 --> 04:32.806
* HAD ME A BLAST

04:32.840 --> 04:33.907
* SUMMER LOVIN'

04:33.941 --> 04:35.976

04:36.009 --> 04:38.011

04:38.045 --> 04:39.112

04:39.146 --> 04:42.049
HEY, JIMMY.
CAN YOU GO UPSTAIRS
AND TELL YOUR SISTER

04:42.082 --> 04:44.051
TO TURN THAT STUFF
DOWN, PLEASE?

04:44.084 --> 04:46.086
JIMMY.

04:46.119 --> 04:47.488
JIMMY!

04:47.521 --> 04:49.990
DAD, YOU MADE ME LOSE
A WARIO!

04:50.023 --> 04:52.860
AAAAAHHH!

04:53.494 --> 04:54.728
OOH.

04:54.762 --> 04:56.997
NOT BAD.

04:57.898 --> 05:01.435
THOSE GIFTS
WERE DELIBERATELY
DESIGNED BY YOUR FATHER

05:01.469 --> 05:03.804
TO DRIVE ME INSANE.

05:04.071 --> 05:06.006
OH, MY GOD,
YOU'RE RIGHT!

05:06.039 --> 05:08.542
HE--HE'S DIABOLICAL!

05:08.942 --> 05:11.412
I MEAN,
WHAT BETTER WAY
TO DESTROY A MAN

05:11.445 --> 05:13.614
THAN BY GIVING
NICE GIFTS
TO HIS CHILDREN?

05:13.647 --> 05:15.516
HE'S EVIL!
HE'S JUST LIKE SANTA!

05:15.549 --> 05:16.917
OK, NOW YOU'RE
TWISTING MY WORKS, OK?

05:16.950 --> 05:18.852
NO, COME ON,
YOU'RE LOSING IT,
ALL RIGHT?

05:18.886 --> 05:20.621
YOU'RE NOT SLEEPING,
SWEETIE.
YOU'RE TIRED.

05:20.654 --> 05:22.356
YOU'RE WORKING
ALL THOSE DOUBLE
SHIFTS.

05:22.390 --> 05:24.091
IT'S NOT
THE DOUBLE SHIFTS!
IT'S YOUR DAD!

05:24.124 --> 05:25.859
[LILY SINGING
SUMMER NIGHTS]

05:25.893 --> 05:28.796
OH, GOD, THERE'S

05:28.829 --> 05:29.463
LILY!

05:29.497 --> 05:31.399
OH, WOULD YOU
KEEP IT DOWN?

05:31.432 --> 05:34.067
YOU'RE THROWING OFF
MY RHYTHM!

05:36.770 --> 05:39.740
* SUMMER THING
DON'T MEAN A THING *

05:39.773 --> 05:42.410

05:44.645 --> 05:46.647
OH, GOD,
THE O'BRIENS ARE LUCKY.

05:46.680 --> 05:48.982
THEIR DAUGHTER
JUST SETS FIRES.

05:49.016 --> 05:50.384
OK, I'M SORRY.
I'M SORRY.

05:50.418 --> 05:52.986
I'M SORRY MY FATHER
BUYS OUR KIDS
NICE GIFTS

05:53.020 --> 05:56.624
AND HE CHANGES
LIGHT BULBS AND TAKES US
OUT TO NICE DINNERS.

05:56.657 --> 05:57.958
OH, TAKES US OUT
TO NICE DINNERS WHEN?

05:57.991 --> 05:59.927
LAST NIGHT!
OH, NO, NO, NO, NO.

05:59.960 --> 06:01.995
HE INVITED US
OUT TO DINNER.

06:02.029 --> 06:05.132
HE DID NOT TAKE US
OUT TO DINNER.

06:05.699 --> 06:06.266
THAT WAS GREAT.

06:06.299 --> 06:07.601
YEAH, GOOD CHOICE,
DADDY.

06:07.635 --> 06:11.839
WELL, THE OLD MAN
KNOWS HIS CHINESE, TINK.

06:21.214 --> 06:23.684
YOU KNOW, I COULD
STILL GO FOR

06:23.717 --> 06:26.086
SOME OF THAT
MONGOLIAN BEEF, HUH?

06:26.119 --> 06:30.491
YEAH. YEAH,
THAT MONGOLIAN BEEF IS...

06:31.124 --> 06:32.460
GOOD STUFF.

06:32.493 --> 06:33.794
SURE IS.

06:33.827 --> 06:37.998
GOES REALLY WELL
WITH THE, UH,
FRIED RICE.

06:39.066 --> 06:40.000
HMM.

06:40.033 --> 06:42.536
WHERE IS THAT...

06:42.570 --> 06:45.038
DUCK SAUCE? OH!

06:45.639 --> 06:46.707
THERE IT IS.

06:46.740 --> 06:49.042
WELL, THERE'S REALLY
NO POINT IN HAVING
ANY DUCK SAUCE

06:49.076 --> 06:52.145
UNLESS YOU'RE GONNA
HAVE ANOTHER EGG ROLL.

06:52.179 --> 06:55.182
I DON'T WANT
AN EGG ROLL.

06:57.518 --> 07:00.521
WELL, THEN,
WHAT'S THE POINT
IN THE DUCK SAUCE?

07:00.554 --> 07:02.556
IT'S A PALATE CLEANSER.

07:02.590 --> 07:06.760
WELL, SO, THEN,
IS THE SOY SAUCE!

07:12.099 --> 07:16.737
I BETTER SEE
IF I CAN GET THIS OFF
BEFORE IT SETS.

07:20.541 --> 07:23.210
OH, UH...

07:23.844 --> 07:26.179
I...HAVE...

07:28.048 --> 07:28.782
THEY ARE OUR GUESTS.

07:28.816 --> 07:30.918
I MEAN, WE SHOULD
PAY FOR DINNER.

07:30.951 --> 07:32.352
BABY, I GOT NO PROBLEM
PAYING.

07:32.385 --> 07:35.989
I JUST WANT HIM TO OFFER
JUST ONCE--JUST TO MAKE
A REACH FOR HIS WALLET.

07:36.023 --> 07:38.158
YOU KNOW, JUST A REACH!

07:39.226 --> 07:40.894
WHAT THE HELL
IS THAT?

07:48.969 --> 07:52.573
OH! JIMMY,
WHAT HAPPENED HERE?

07:52.606 --> 07:53.841
JIMMY!

07:53.874 --> 07:55.008
DO YOU MIND?

07:55.042 --> 07:55.809
OH, CLAUDIA,

07:55.843 --> 07:57.811
YOUR DAD'S PUTTING UP
THAT MAILBOX.

07:57.845 --> 07:59.647
IF YOU DON'T WANT HIM
TO PUT IT UP,

07:59.680 --> 08:02.215
GO OUT THERE
AND NICELY ASK HIM
NOT TO.

08:02.249 --> 08:03.551
ALL RIGHT.
I'M GOING TO.

08:03.584 --> 08:06.086
NICELY. NICE.
OK.

08:08.956 --> 08:11.291
UH...WHAT ARE YOU
DOING?

08:11.324 --> 08:13.594
OH, PUTTING UP
YOUR NEW MAILBOX.

08:13.627 --> 08:15.095
WASN'T SURE
YOU KNEW HOW.

08:15.128 --> 08:18.198
OH, WELL, YEAH.
2 SCREWS. I THINK
I COULD HANDLE IT.

08:18.231 --> 08:20.768
BECAUSE, UH...
WASN'T UP YET.

08:20.801 --> 08:22.703
WELL, SEE,
WE ALREADY HAVE
A MAILBOX,

08:22.736 --> 08:24.905
AND IT'S GREAT.
IT'S WORKED FOR YEARS.

08:24.938 --> 08:26.707
YEAH. NOT AS BIG
AS THIS ONE.

08:26.740 --> 08:28.776
HA HA.
NO, THAT'S BIG.
YEAH.

08:28.809 --> 08:31.679
THAT'S A REAL BIG
EAGLE UP THERE.

08:33.213 --> 08:34.748
THERE'S AN APOSTROPHE.

08:34.782 --> 08:36.617
YEAH.
"THE FINNERTY'S."

08:36.650 --> 08:38.085
THAT'S, UH...

08:38.118 --> 08:41.154
THAT'S POSSESSIVE.
THE FINNERTY'S WHAT?

08:41.188 --> 08:44.157
MAILBOX.

08:45.258 --> 08:48.295
IT'S NOT MY FAULT.
JIMMY SHOULD HAVE
STOPPED ME.

08:48.328 --> 08:51.732
GO...WASH YOUR HANDS.

08:53.200 --> 08:54.702
MM-HMM. YEAH.

08:57.671 --> 09:00.207
WELL, IT'S GOT
AN APOSTROPHE.

09:00.240 --> 09:00.908
WHAT?

09:00.941 --> 09:03.243
THE MAILBOX.
IT SAYS FINNERTY,

09:03.276 --> 09:04.978
APOSTROPHE "S".

09:05.012 --> 09:06.013
SO WHAT?

09:06.046 --> 09:07.280
SO PEOPLE
ARE GONNA THINK
THIS HOUSE IS OCCUPIED

09:07.314 --> 09:11.785
BY A SINGLE FINNERTY
WHO'S EXTREMELY
POSSESSIVE OF HIS MAILBOX.

09:11.819 --> 09:12.886
OK, YOU KNOW WHAT?

09:12.920 --> 09:16.123
YOUR IN-LAWS ARE CRAZY
AND THEY'RE RUINING
YOUR LIFE.

09:16.156 --> 09:18.091
WELCOME TO MY CLUB.

09:18.125 --> 09:20.360
OH, CLAUDIA,
MIND IF I TEAR OUT
THE CROSSWORD?

09:20.393 --> 09:24.865
WALT, I HAVEN'T EVEN
READ THE PAPER.

09:25.232 --> 09:26.166
GOT ANY TAPE?

09:26.199 --> 09:28.135
EDDIE,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

09:28.168 --> 09:29.169
I'M MAKING
A HEALTH SHAKE.

09:29.202 --> 09:32.139
I'M GONNA START
LIFTING AND WORKING
ON MY GUNS.

09:32.172 --> 09:33.774
I NEED A LOT
OF NUTRIENTS.

09:33.807 --> 09:34.608
YOU REALIZE, OF COURSE,

09:34.642 --> 09:37.845
I BOUGHT ALL THIS FOOD
FOR MY CHILDREN.

09:37.878 --> 09:42.182
THAT'S ALL RIGHT.
I GOT ENOUGH
FOR EVERYBODY.

09:44.217 --> 09:46.987
OH, THAT IS NASTY!

09:48.856 --> 09:52.292
AND DO I GET
ANGRY AT THEM FOR
MISPLACED APOSTROPHES?

09:52.325 --> 09:56.797
OK, IN ALL FAIRNESS,
MY BROTHER EDDIE'S
GRAMMAR IS EXCELLENT!

09:57.865 --> 10:00.200
OK...OK.
THEY'RE YOUR PARENTS.

10:00.233 --> 10:02.803
I OVERREACTED.
I'M SORRY.

10:02.836 --> 10:05.272
NOT ME. THEM.

10:11.244 --> 10:14.314
IT REALLY ADDS A CHARM
THAT THE HOUSE LACKED.

10:14.347 --> 10:15.248
DOESN'T IT?

10:15.282 --> 10:16.950
OH, MAUREEN,
TONY...

10:16.984 --> 10:21.388
NO, SEE,
THERE'S NO NEED
TO DO THAT.

10:21.421 --> 10:23.423
YOU MIND JUST
TAKING A SEAT?

10:23.456 --> 10:25.926
I WANTED
TO APOLOGIZE.

10:26.794 --> 10:27.661
SEE, I'VE, UH...

10:27.695 --> 10:29.763
I'VE BEEN
GIVING THIS
A LOT OF THOUGHT,

10:29.797 --> 10:32.666
AND I--I ACTED
SHAMEFULLY.

10:32.700 --> 10:35.803
AND, UH,
I WAS YELLING,
I WAS OUT OF CONTROL,

10:35.836 --> 10:37.337
AND I'M SORRY.

10:37.370 --> 10:40.140
WELL, THAT'S VERY
DECENT OF YOU,
SEAN.

10:40.173 --> 10:41.041
YES.

10:41.074 --> 10:44.077
IT'S TRUE,
AND I HOPE YOU CAN
FORGIVE ME.

10:44.111 --> 10:45.012
I JUST DIDN'T UNDERSTAND

10:45.045 --> 10:48.081
WHY YOU MADE SUCH A FUSS
ABOUT A DISHWASHER.

10:48.115 --> 10:51.284
EXACTLY. EXACTLY.
AND THAT'S WHY
I'M APOLOGIZING.

10:51.318 --> 10:53.353
YOU DID OFFER
TO RINSE 'EM.
YEAH.

10:53.386 --> 10:55.989
UH-UH. RIGHT AGAIN.
RIGHT AGAIN.

10:56.023 --> 10:57.290
MY BAD. MY BAD.

10:57.324 --> 11:00.027
THAT'S WHY, UM...
I'M SORRY.
MY FAULT.

11:00.060 --> 11:03.163
WE'RE JUST LOOKING OUT
FOR THE KIDS.
YOU UNDERSTAND.

11:03.196 --> 11:05.298
OF COURSE I DO.
CAN WE TALK ABOUT
SOMETHING ELSE?

11:05.332 --> 11:07.400
SURE, SURE.
BUT THERE ARE OTHER WAYS
TO SAVE MONEY

11:07.434 --> 11:10.303
ON YOUR WATER BILL
IF THAT'S WHAT
YOU'RE LOOKING FOR.

11:10.337 --> 11:12.372
OH, YEAH.
I'M SURE YOU
COULD TEACH ME

11:12.405 --> 11:15.342
A FEW TRICKS ON
HOW TO SAVE MONEY,
HUH, TONY?

11:15.375 --> 11:17.044
WHAT'S THAT SUPPOSED
TO MEAN?

11:17.077 --> 11:18.779
WELL, YOU KNOW,
AT THE END
OF THE MEAL

11:18.812 --> 11:21.148
WHEN THAT GUY BRINGS
THAT LITTLE PIECE
OF PAPER BY ON A TRAY,

11:21.181 --> 11:23.350
SEE, THAT THING'S
CALLED A CHECK,
AND IT WOULDN'T HURT YA

11:23.383 --> 11:26.286
IF YOU PICKED
THE DAMN THING UP
EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE!

11:26.319 --> 11:27.755
ALL RIGHT.
HERE WE GO AGAIN.

11:27.788 --> 11:29.857
TONY, I'M AFRAID.
WE ARE LEAVING!

11:29.890 --> 11:31.925
NO, NO, NO!
WELL, GOOD! GOOD!

11:31.959 --> 11:32.826
NO, NO!

11:32.860 --> 11:34.962
WHAT THE HELL
KIND OF AN APOLOGY
IS THAT?

11:34.995 --> 11:37.397
GOD, BABY, I'M SORRY!
I WAS TRYING!

11:37.430 --> 11:39.967
I WAS BEING NICE!
TONY!

11:40.000 --> 11:40.934
TONY! MAUREEN...

11:40.968 --> 11:42.069
DO YOU BELIEVE THIS?

11:42.102 --> 11:43.470
DU--HU--UH--

11:44.972 --> 11:47.407
GIMME THAT!
JUST STAY!
TONY, PLEASE!

11:47.440 --> 11:49.309
GIMME THAT!

11:51.044 --> 11:52.780
TONY!

11:52.813 --> 11:53.747
DAD?!

11:54.414 --> 11:56.249
HEY, JIMMY,
GET SOME ICE!

11:56.283 --> 11:59.386
DAD, YOU MADE ME
LOSE A WARIO!

11:59.419 --> 12:01.121
Tony: AAAHHHH!

12:03.023 --> 12:04.124
* TELL ME MORE,
TELL ME MORE *

12:04.157 --> 12:05.793

12:05.826 --> 12:10.097
HEY, SEAN, WHAT'S UP
WITH THE EXTRA MAILBOX?

12:10.130 --> 12:11.431
TONY!
YOU'RE STILL HERE.

12:11.464 --> 12:14.201
THOUGHT
YOU WERE LEAVING
THIS MORNING.

12:14.234 --> 12:17.104
NO. I CAN'T DRIVE BACK
ON THIS BUM LEG.

12:17.137 --> 12:19.472
WHO KNOWS
HOW LONG I'LL BE HERE.

12:19.506 --> 12:21.875
WHAT HAPPENED?

12:21.909 --> 12:24.077
SEAN, WHY DON'T YOU
TELL THEM?

12:24.111 --> 12:26.379
HE FELL DOWN
THE STAIRS.

12:26.413 --> 12:28.281
HE PUSHED ME.

12:28.315 --> 12:31.518
YOU DON'T SAY?

12:32.285 --> 12:36.824
* SUMMER LOVIN',
HAPPENED SO FAST *

12:36.857 --> 12:40.360

CRAZY FOR ME *

12:40.393 --> 12:44.231
* I MET A BOY,
CUTE AS CAN BE *

12:44.264 --> 12:47.300

DRIFTIN' AWAY *

12:47.334 --> 12:50.237
* TO OH, OH,

12:50.270 --> 12:52.139

12:56.109 --> 12:58.111
* TELL ME MORE,
TELL ME MORE *

12:58.145 --> 12:59.913

12:59.947 --> 13:00.981
* WELL-A, WELL-A,
WELL-A, HOOH *

13:01.014 --> 13:05.252
OK, ED. DIDN'T SHE
GET ANOTHER SONG
WITH THAT THING?

13:05.285 --> 13:07.120
YEAH. I THINK
SHE LIKES THAT ONE.

13:07.154 --> 13:08.155
HOW LUCKY FOR US.

13:08.188 --> 13:10.557
* WELL-A, WELL-A,
WELL-A, UH! *

13:10.590 --> 13:13.260
SO, WALT,
HAVEN'T SEEN YOU
FOR A WEEK.

13:13.293 --> 13:14.962
WHAT YOU BEEN UP TO?

13:14.995 --> 13:17.998
AH, YOU KNOW,
I BEEN WORKIN'
LIKE AN S-O-B.

13:18.031 --> 13:19.332
YEAH, YEAH. SO...

13:19.366 --> 13:21.034
WHERE YOU WORKIN' NOW?

13:21.068 --> 13:23.370
I'M STILL DOWN
AT THE LANDFILL.

13:23.403 --> 13:26.206
REALLY? AH.

13:26.239 --> 13:27.074
WHAT?

13:27.107 --> 13:28.241
OH, IT'S JUST,
YOU KNOW,

13:28.275 --> 13:30.143
WHAT WITH
ALL THE DOWNSIZING

13:30.177 --> 13:32.913
AND TECHNOLOGICAL
ADVANCEMENTS
AND WHATNOT...

13:32.946 --> 13:36.383
NO, NO, NO, NO.
THE LANDFILL'S
STILL THRIVING.

13:36.416 --> 13:37.550
OH, YEAH?

13:37.584 --> 13:40.888
I WAS JUST READING
ABOUT THE NEW BREED
OF INCINERATORS--

13:40.921 --> 13:42.455
FULLY AUTOMATED.

13:42.489 --> 13:43.223
UH-HUH.

13:43.256 --> 13:45.292
WELL, THOSE ARE
STILL YEARS AWAY.

13:45.325 --> 13:49.229
OH! WELL, WE HAD ONE
DOWN IN SOUTH HILLS

13:49.262 --> 13:51.164
SINCE '99.

13:51.198 --> 13:52.065
OH, HAVE YOU?

13:52.099 --> 13:54.234
YEAH! YEP, YEP, YEP.

13:54.267 --> 13:58.238
GOT A WHOLE BUNCH
OF CITY WORKERS
OUT ON THE STREET.

13:58.271 --> 13:59.606
IT'S SAD, REALLY.

13:59.639 --> 14:02.409
PAID ONE OF 'EM A BUCK
TO WASH MY CAR.

14:02.442 --> 14:04.912
HE WAS HAPPY TO GET IT.

14:05.545 --> 14:08.648
AW, NOW, YOU DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

14:08.681 --> 14:11.518
SEE, THE GARBAGE BUSINESS
HAS GOT COMPLEXITIES

14:11.551 --> 14:13.987
YOU CAN'T EVEN BEGIN
TO UNDERSTAND.

14:14.021 --> 14:16.523
SO WHY DON'T YOU JUST,
UH...

14:16.556 --> 14:18.225
SHUT UP.

14:20.360 --> 14:22.062
* SUMMER LOVIN'

14:22.095 --> 14:23.931
* HAD ME A BLAST

14:23.964 --> 14:26.366
BIG MOUTH
KNOW-IT-ALL
SON OF A--

14:26.399 --> 14:28.168
BEEN CHATTIN'
WITH TONY, DAD?

14:28.201 --> 14:30.537
HE SAYS PEOPLE
ARE GONNA STOP
MAKING GARBAGE.

14:30.570 --> 14:33.540
LOOK, THE MAN
IS STUCK ON THE COUCH.
HE CAN'T MOVE.

14:33.573 --> 14:35.408
THE LEAST ONE OF YOU
IDIOTS CAN DO

14:35.442 --> 14:37.377
IS GO PLAY CHECKERS
WITH HIM OR SOMETHING.

14:37.410 --> 14:40.513
BABY, HEY, HEY, I'D LOVE TO,
BUT I GOT TO GO TO WORK.

14:40.547 --> 14:43.283
YOU HAVE THE NIGHT
SHIFT AGAIN?

14:43.316 --> 14:45.418
NO.
YEAH.

14:46.353 --> 14:47.387
GIMME THE KEY.

14:47.420 --> 14:48.455
THE KEY?!

14:48.488 --> 14:49.722
THE KEY TO MY PLACE.

14:49.756 --> 14:55.228
EVER SINCE YOUR PARENTS
GOT INTO TOWN,
I CAN'T GET RID OF HIM.

14:55.262 --> 14:56.396
THANKS A LOT, ED.

14:56.429 --> 14:57.530
I'M SORRY.

14:57.564 --> 15:00.700
YOUR LITTLE...CHARADE
HAS BECOME INCONVENIENT
FOR ME.

15:02.269 --> 15:03.503
HELLO?
Man: HEY, THADDEUS.

15:03.536 --> 15:06.073
THADDEUS?
NO, NO, YOU GOT
THE WRONG NUMBER.

15:06.106 --> 15:07.407
THERE'S
NO THADDEUS HERE.

15:07.440 --> 15:08.341
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

15:08.375 --> 15:10.310
IT WAS JUST
A WRONG NUMBER.
I'M THADDEUS!

15:10.343 --> 15:13.446
OH, WELL, THAT WAS
FOR YOU, THEN.

15:13.646 --> 15:17.184
THAT'S A $300-BOTTLE
OF CABERNET.

15:20.420 --> 15:22.022
I--I DIDN'T HAVE MUCH.

15:22.055 --> 15:23.723
OH, MAN,
YOU WON'T BELIEVE IT.

15:23.756 --> 15:26.259
WHAT A DAY AT WORK!

15:26.293 --> 15:27.260
OH--

15:27.294 --> 15:29.029
OH.

15:29.262 --> 15:33.000
WOW. NICE WORK.
WHO IS THAT?

15:33.666 --> 15:35.235
YOU WERE ABUSING
MY HOSPITALITY.

15:35.268 --> 15:39.172
A GOOD HOUSE GUEST
SHOULD BE ALMOST
INVISIBLE.

15:39.206 --> 15:40.440
YOU LIED TO ME
ALL WEEK!

15:40.473 --> 15:43.476
BABY, I DID IT FOR YOU, OK?
IF I HADN'T GOTTEN
OUTTA THE HOUSE,

15:43.510 --> 15:47.047
I WOULD HAVE KILLED
YOUR PARENTS BY NOW!

15:47.347 --> 15:49.416
* IT TURNED COLDER

15:49.449 --> 15:53.186
* THAT'S WHERE IT ENDS

15:53.220 --> 15:54.454
* SO I TOLD HER

15:54.487 --> 15:57.724
* WE'D STILL BE
FRIENDS *

15:57.757 --> 15:59.526
* THEN WE MADE

15:59.559 --> 16:04.497
* OUR TRUE LOVE VOW

16:05.332 --> 16:07.400
* WONDER WHAT

16:07.434 --> 16:12.005
* SHE'S DOIN'
NO-HOW-OW *

16:14.507 --> 16:17.344
* SUMMER DREAMS

16:17.377 --> 16:21.214
* RIPPED AT THE SEAMS

16:21.248 --> 16:22.549
* BU-UT

16:22.582 --> 16:24.551
* OH
* OH!

16:24.584 --> 16:29.322
* THOSE SU-HUM-MER

16:29.356 --> 16:32.492
* NIGH--

16:42.369 --> 16:45.238
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
HUH?

16:46.439 --> 16:48.775
I HAVE A BOYFRIEND,
YOU KNOW.

16:48.808 --> 16:51.211
YOU DID IT! I--

16:51.244 --> 16:54.647
DEAN IS GONNA
KICK YOUR ASS!

16:54.681 --> 16:56.183
WEL--H--

16:56.216 --> 16:57.584
I KNOW WHAT'S
GOIN' ON HERE.

16:57.617 --> 17:01.521
WE SOUND GREAT
TOGETHER, AND YOU
CAN'T HANDLE IT!

17:01.554 --> 17:02.489
GET OUT!

17:02.522 --> 17:04.524
WA--WH--
OUT! OUT!

17:04.557 --> 17:06.493
GET OUT!

17:08.428 --> 17:12.199
LISTEN TO THE MUSIC
OF YOUR HEART!

17:16.403 --> 17:17.437
HEY!

17:17.470 --> 17:19.239
WHAT ARE THOSE,
HENRY?

17:19.272 --> 17:21.608
THOSE ARE BOOBIES.

17:23.776 --> 17:25.545
HEY, JIMMY,
WHAT DID YOU DO?

17:25.578 --> 17:27.147
I'VE BEEN PLAYING
THIS GAMEBOY

17:27.180 --> 17:31.484
FOR, LIKE,
6 STRAIGHT HOURS.
IT'S AWESOME!

17:32.385 --> 17:35.522
DID YOU HAPPEN
TO FALL ASLEEP,
BY ANY CHANCE?

17:35.555 --> 17:39.058
MAYBE A MINUTE OR TWO.

17:39.659 --> 17:43.630
HEY, WHAT ARE YOU ALL
LOOKING AT ME FOR?

17:45.432 --> 17:48.535
WHOA, DUDE,
WHAT IS WITH
YOUR FACE, MAN?

17:48.568 --> 17:49.536
WHAT?

17:49.569 --> 17:52.872
YOU'RE PAINTED
LIKE A VOODOO MAN
OR SOMETHING.

17:54.574 --> 17:56.443
THAT'S COOL.

17:58.545 --> 18:00.447
I'M GONNA KILL YOU!
IT LOOKS GOOD!

18:00.480 --> 18:01.481
I'LL GO SEE WHAT
THAT'S ALL ABOUT.

18:01.514 --> 18:04.517
OH, NO, NO, YOU DON'T
HAVE TO DO THAT,
ALL RIGHT?

18:04.551 --> 18:05.652
YOU HAVE BEEN
IMAGINING THINGS

18:05.685 --> 18:08.355
AND MISINTERPRETING
THINGS ALL WEEK,
ALL RIGHT? ENOUGH!

18:08.388 --> 18:11.424
YOU HAVE TO GO IN THERE
AND YOU HAVE TO MAKE
PEACE WITH MY DAD.

18:11.458 --> 18:13.360
GO.
BABY,
I DON'T KNOW HOW!

18:13.393 --> 18:15.528
JUST TALK TO HIM,
ALL RIGHT?

18:15.562 --> 18:17.830
JUST TAKE HIM A BEER.

18:24.404 --> 18:27.140
I SAW THAT.

18:31.378 --> 18:32.579
HEY, TONY.

18:32.612 --> 18:33.446
HEY.

18:33.480 --> 18:34.914
WANNA BEER?

18:34.947 --> 18:37.317
SURE.

18:40.587 --> 18:42.522
YOU DIDN'T
SHAKE IT UP, DID YA?

18:42.555 --> 18:45.558
COME ON,
WHAT AM I, LIKE, 8?

18:48.495 --> 18:51.831
YOU KNOW, I KNOW
THINGS HAVE BEEN TENSE
AROUND HERE...

18:51.864 --> 18:54.434
FOR THE LAST WEEK,
YOU KNOW,
AND IT'S ALL MY FAULT.

18:54.467 --> 18:57.470
IT'S JUST I WAS
RUNNING AROUND SO MUCH,
AND I WAS WORKING,

18:57.504 --> 18:59.606
THE KIDS
WERE DRIVING ME CRAZY,

18:59.639 --> 19:01.608
AND MY MIND
JUST STARTED SPINNING,

19:01.641 --> 19:02.809
AND I THOUGHT
YOU WERE...

19:02.842 --> 19:06.913
THOUGHT YOU WERE
DOING ALL THESE THINGS
'CAUSE YOU HATED ME.

19:06.946 --> 19:07.680
OH, SEAN--

19:07.714 --> 19:09.849
I KNOW, I KNOW,
IT'S SILLY. IT'S--

19:09.882 --> 19:11.618
NO, IT ISN'T.
I DO HATE YOU.

19:11.651 --> 19:14.754
I KNEW IT!
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I KNEW IT.

19:14.787 --> 19:16.656
WHY, MAN?
WHY DO YOU HATE ME?

19:16.689 --> 19:17.657
WHY? WHY WOULD I
HATE THE GUY

19:17.690 --> 19:19.526
THAT KNOCKED UP
MY LITTLE GIRL
IN HIGH SCHOOL?

19:19.559 --> 19:21.828
OH, COME ON, MAN,
THAT WAS A MUTUAL
THING.

19:21.861 --> 19:24.364
IF YOU HADN'T
PUSHED ME DOWN
THOSE STAIRS,

19:24.397 --> 19:25.598
I'D BE KICKING
YOUR BUTT RIGHT NOW.

19:25.632 --> 19:27.367
OH, YEAH? IF I TIED
ONE LEG BEHIND
MY BACK,

19:27.400 --> 19:29.236
I'D BE KICKING YOUR ASS
HOPPING ON ONE FOOT!

19:29.269 --> 19:31.471
YOU WANNA GO?
COME ON, LET'S GO!

19:31.504 --> 19:32.772
Claudia: SEAN!
HELP ME UP!

19:32.805 --> 19:34.674
HOW IS THIS
MAKING PEACE?

19:34.707 --> 19:37.377
HE HATES ME, BABY.
HE ADMITTED IT!

19:37.410 --> 19:37.944
DAD.

19:37.977 --> 19:39.446

19:39.479 --> 19:40.713
I TOLD YOU.

19:40.747 --> 19:41.948

EVER DO?

19:41.981 --> 19:45.618
OH, BECAUSE HE JUST
RUINED YOUR LIFE!

19:46.453 --> 19:47.487
DID YOU KNOW

19:47.520 --> 19:49.556
THAT CLAUDIA
WAS THE THIRD GRADE
SPELLING CHAMPION?

19:49.589 --> 19:50.923
NO.
NO. SHE WAS.

19:50.957 --> 19:54.261
YOU KNOW WHAT
SPELLING CHAMPIONS
GROW UP TO BE?

19:54.294 --> 19:55.528
PROFESSIONAL
SPELLERS?

19:55.562 --> 19:57.397
NO. LAWYERS. ENGINEERS.

19:57.430 --> 19:59.666
SHE WAS GONNA GO
TO M.I.T.!

19:59.699 --> 20:00.600
I WAS?

20:00.633 --> 20:04.271
YEAH. YOU WERE GONNA
WORK WITH SUPERCOLLIDER.

20:04.304 --> 20:07.240
DO YOU
EVEN KNOW WHAT
A SUPERCOLLIDER IS?

20:07.274 --> 20:10.710
WELL, IT'S SOME KINDA
BIG...COLEADER.

20:10.743 --> 20:13.513
YOU WOULD HAVE
EXPLAINED IT TO ME.

20:13.546 --> 20:15.548
OK, DAD, M.I.T.?
ARE YOU NUTS?

20:15.582 --> 20:17.650
I BARELY PASSED
ALGEBRA!

20:17.684 --> 20:19.719
YOU WERE GONNA WRITE
A HELL OF AN ESSAY,

20:19.752 --> 20:21.488
AND I WAS GONNA
PULL SOME STRINGS.

20:21.521 --> 20:23.990
WHAT STRINGS
DO YOU HAVE
AT M.I.T.?

20:24.023 --> 20:25.558
I WOULDA FOUND STRINGS!

20:25.592 --> 20:28.595
BUT NO!
ALL THOSE DREAMS
WENT AWAY

20:28.628 --> 20:30.997
WHEN HE DID
WHAT HE DID.

20:31.030 --> 20:31.898
YOU KNOW WHAT, DADDY?

20:31.931 --> 20:33.966
YOU'RE OUT OF YOUR
MIND A LITTLE BIT,
OK?

20:34.000 --> 20:36.703
IT'S SWEET,
BUT, UM...
THE THING IS,

20:36.736 --> 20:39.038
THAT LIFE...
THAT YOU IMAGINED
FOR ME

20:39.071 --> 20:41.574
WAS NEVER GONNA
BE MY LIFE.

20:41.608 --> 20:45.345
THIS IS MY LIFE.
HERE. WITH SEAN.

20:49.616 --> 20:51.651
STOP THAT.

20:54.754 --> 20:56.289
TELL ME SOMETHING.

20:56.323 --> 20:57.790
IS STROLLO'S
STILL OPEN?

20:57.824 --> 20:59.426
YES, IT IS.

20:59.459 --> 21:01.661
WELL, SEAN,
WHAT DO YOU SAY

21:01.694 --> 21:04.697
WE ALL GO OUT,
GET US A STEAK?

21:07.367 --> 21:08.835
STEAK SOUNDS
REAL GOOD, POP-POP.

21:08.868 --> 21:10.937
YOU DON'T GET TO
CALL ME POP-POP.

21:10.970 --> 21:12.605
COME ON, MAUREEN.

21:12.639 --> 21:15.342
SEAN IS TAKING US OUT

21:24.717 --> 21:25.785
OH, NO.

21:25.818 --> 21:27.787

21:29.356 --> 21:31.558

21:31.591 --> 21:33.526

21:33.560 --> 21:35.462

22:00.587 --> 22:03.022

22:03.055 --> 22:04.524
AAH!

22:04.557 --> 22:06.559

GET ME A FRIEND? *

22:06.593 --> 22:08.595
