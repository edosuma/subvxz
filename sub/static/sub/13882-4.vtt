01:03.000 --> 01:06.754
This is an SOS distress call
from the mining ship Red Dwarf,

01:06.840 --> 01:10.230
The crew are dead, killed by a radiation leak,

01:10.320 --> 01:14.518
The only survivors were Dave Lister,
who was in suspended animation,

01:14.600 --> 01:18.275
and his pregnant cat,
who was safely sealed in the hold,

01:18.360 --> 01:20.351
Revived three million years later,

01:20.440 --> 01:23.716
Lister's only companions are
a life form who evolved from his cat

01:23.800 --> 01:26.633
and Arnold Rimmer, a hologram
simulation of one of the dead crew,

01:29.280 --> 01:31.271
The most interesting event recently

01:31.360 --> 01:34.796
was that Lister pretended
he'd passed the chef's exam,

01:34.880 --> 01:40.512
That gives you some idea of how
exciting some days are around here,

01:42.360 --> 01:45.955
Holly, give me access
to the crew's confidential reports.

01:46.040 --> 01:48.713
Those are for the Captain's eyes only,

01:48.800 --> 01:52.839
Fine. We'll give him ten seconds
to come back from the dead,

01:52.920 --> 01:55.514
then we'll presume I'm in charge.

01:56.200 --> 01:59.795
- No, he hasn't managed it.
- Whose do you want?

01:59.880 --> 02:03.350
Give me... Give me Lister's. Just the remarks.

02:03.440 --> 02:06.750
David Lister, technician, 3rd class,

02:06.840 --> 02:10.674
Captain's remarks - "Has requested
sick leave due to diarrhoea

02:10.759 --> 02:13.513
"on no less than 500 occasions,

02:13.600 --> 02:17.513
"Left previous job as a supermarket
trolley attendant after ten years

02:17.600 --> 02:21.115
"because he didn't want
to get tied to a career,

02:21.200 --> 02:23.191
"Promotion prospects - zero, "

02:23.280 --> 02:25.271
I always li ked Captai n Hollister.

02:25.360 --> 02:27.510
Such a great reader of men.

02:27.600 --> 02:31.798
A marvellous, marvellous man,
and a tragic loss to us all.

02:31.880 --> 02:34.394
All right, Holly, give me mine.

02:34.480 --> 02:37.278
Arnold Rimmer, technician, 2nd class,

02:37.360 --> 02:42.480
Captain's remarks - "If a job's
worth doing, it's worth doing well,

02:42.560 --> 02:45.120
"If it's not, give it to Rimmer,

02:45.200 --> 02:48.988
"He aches for responsibility
but constantly fails the engineering exam, "

02:49.080 --> 02:53.711
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Holly, Holly...
MY report - Ri mmer. Two Ms.

02:53.800 --> 02:55.950
"Astoundingly zealous, Possibly mad,

02:56.040 --> 02:59.112
"Probably has more teeth than brain cells,

02:59.200 --> 03:01.191
"Promotion prospects - comical, "

03:01.280 --> 03:04.795
Two Rs.

03:04.880 --> 03:06.950
Arnold, this is your report,

03:07.040 --> 03:10.077
I always hated that pus- head Hollister.

03:10.160 --> 03:12.151
He always resented my popularity.

03:12.240 --> 03:13.719
He ignored my proposal

03:13.800 --> 03:17.031
to reduce the minimum
haircut length by an eighth of an inch.

03:17.120 --> 03:19.350
Small-minded, petty-thinking modo.

03:19.440 --> 03:22.273
Arnold, I'm picking up an unidentified object,

03:22.360 --> 03:26.512
"Constantly fails the exam"?
I'd hardly call 11 times "constantly".

03:26.600 --> 03:29.831
If you eat beef 11 times in your life,

03:29.920 --> 03:33.469
one would hardly say
that person constantly eats beef.

03:33.560 --> 03:36.358
It would be a rare, nay, freak occurrence.

03:36.440 --> 03:39.079
"Possibly mad"?! What's he drivelling about?

03:39.160 --> 03:42.118
- It's on the screen, Arnie,
- What is it?

03:42.200 --> 03:45.033
- I don't know,
- You'd better find out.

03:45.120 --> 03:49.591
It's obviously beyond me.
I've got more teeth than brain cells.

03:49.680 --> 03:51.989
Yes, you have,

04:08.600 --> 04:11.319
Would you like some toast?

04:11.400 --> 04:13.755
- Uh-uh.
- Some nice buttered toast?

04:13.840 --> 04:15.831
Uh-uh.
- No toast, then?

04:15.920 --> 04:17.238
No.

04:17.320 --> 04:19.310
- What about a muffin?
- Nothing.

04:19.399 --> 04:25.157
You last had toast 1* days ago,
11,36, Tuesday 3rd, Two rounds,

04:25.240 --> 04:26.593
Shh!

04:26.680 --> 04:30.878
Why buy a toaster with artificial
intelligence if you don't like toast?

04:30.960 --> 04:34.714
- I do li ke toast.
- I mean, this is my job!

04:34.800 --> 04:37.189
- This is just cruel,
- I'm busy.

04:37.280 --> 04:41.751
- Not busy eating toast, are you
- I don't want any!

04:41.840 --> 04:46.391
The purpose of my existence
is to serve you with scrummy toast,

04:46.480 --> 04:49.517
If you don't want any,
my existence is meaningless,

04:49.600 --> 04:53.275
- Good.
- I toast, therefore I am,

04:53.360 --> 04:55.510
Will you shut up?

04:58.880 --> 05:01.075
What are you doi ng?

05:01.160 --> 05:03.151
- I'm reading.
- With your nose?

05:03.240 --> 05:06.038
It's a cat book. They use smells.

05:06.120 --> 05:09.669
You run your nose along
and different smells are released.

05:09.760 --> 05:11.751
What a pathetic idea.

05:11.840 --> 05:15.230
Unlike you, my mind is open to new cultures,

05:15.320 --> 05:17.550
new ways of looking at things.

05:17.640 --> 05:22.077
- And what does it say?
- It says, "See Dick run.

05:22.160 --> 05:24.435
"Run, Dick, run.

05:24.520 --> 05:27.796
"Run... home, Dick. "

05:28.800 --> 05:31.633
That's the cat equivalent of Shakespeare, is it?

05:31.720 --> 05:33.711
Shakespeare? Who's Shakespeare?

05:33.800 --> 05:37.156
You moron. An old playwright.
Wilfred Shakespeare.

05:37.920 --> 05:43.119
I'm just starting.
This is for three-year-olds. You should try it.

05:43.360 --> 05:46.909
I'm not interested in smelling
anything cats have to say.

05:47.000 --> 05:49.116
You don't know what you're missing.

05:49.200 --> 05:51.668
There's one where Dick buys this ball...

05:51.760 --> 05:54.320
this big ball... this big red ball.

05:54.400 --> 05:56.595
It's amazing stuff.

05:56.680 --> 06:01.708
You ought to try reading your shirt.
It's probably a novel by Victor Hugo.

06:01.800 --> 06:05.793
Anyway, if you're interested,
Holly's spotted... Is that my shirt?

06:05.880 --> 06:08.599
- Yeah. I borrowed it.
- What's that?

06:08.680 --> 06:11.990
That's definitely biscuit. Erm, that's custard...

06:12.080 --> 06:14.799
Ink... Just general sort of dirty marks.

06:14.880 --> 06:18.873
- You can't go through my possessions!
- You don't need them.

06:18.960 --> 06:20.951
- Because I'm dead?
- Yeah.

06:21.040 --> 06:23.031
Holograms don't need clothes.

06:23.120 --> 06:28.592
They're mine! Would you steal
verruca cream from a man with no feet?

06:28.680 --> 06:32.912
What if I stole your favourite
T- shirt with the custard stains?

06:33.000 --> 06:36.515
- I wouldn't care.
- Stay out of my wardrobe.

06:36.600 --> 06:38.591
OK, OK.

06:38.680 --> 06:42.798
You keep your underpants
on coat-hangers, don't you?

06:42.880 --> 06:44.677
That's private!

06:44.760 --> 06:47.558
OK, Rimmer, OK. Take the shirt back.

06:47.640 --> 06:50.632
I don't want it. You've sweated in it.

06:50.720 --> 06:54.030
- What DO you want?
- Just keep out of my things.

06:54.120 --> 06:57.032
- OK, OK. What's Holly spotted?
- An unidentified object.

06:57.120 --> 07:00.032
- You mean a rock.
- It might not be.

07:00.120 --> 07:02.475
- They're always rocks.
- Mostly, I agree,

07:02.560 --> 07:04.596
but maybe this one's different.

07:04.680 --> 07:06.955
There's nobody out there.

07:07.040 --> 07:10.350
No alien monsters, no Zargon warships,

07:10.440 --> 07:12.715
no beautiful blondes with beehive hairdos,

07:12.800 --> 07:16.509
who say, "Show me more
of this thing called kissing. "

07:16.600 --> 07:22.357
There's just us, the Cat and lots
of smegging rocks. That's it. Finito.

07:22.440 --> 07:25.910
If that's true, what's the point of existence?

07:26.000 --> 07:28.798
Beats me, Do you want some toast?

07:29.920 --> 07:33.356
Arnold, the unidentified
object is now in visual range,

07:33.440 --> 07:36.273
All right, Holly. I'm on my way.

07:44.560 --> 07:47.870
Aow! Nice jump. Hey!

07:47.960 --> 07:51.236
Smooth with a capital "smoo".

07:51.320 --> 07:54.949
OK, time to get out the food detector.

07:57.840 --> 08:01.116
This way. Aow! Ooh!

08:01.200 --> 08:04.829
Yeah, yeah! This way.

08:06.520 --> 08:08.351
Aow! This way!

08:10.920 --> 08:13.150
Ah, you. Where have you been?

08:13.240 --> 08:16.437
Investigating. Investigating this,
investigating that.

08:16.520 --> 08:19.990
- General investigation.
- General investigation, eh?

08:20.080 --> 08:22.275
- Ah, splendid!
- Thank you.

08:22.360 --> 08:24.351
- Keep it up.
- OK.

08:24.440 --> 08:26.431
Fine. Well, excuse me...

08:26.520 --> 08:29.876
Hey! You can't have my shiny thing! It's mine.

08:29.960 --> 08:32.394
What are you drivelling about?

08:32.480 --> 08:37.998
This is my shiny thing.
If you try and take it, I'll eat you.

08:38.080 --> 08:40.230
It's a yo-yo, you modo.

08:40.320 --> 08:42.311
It does two amazing things.

08:42.400 --> 08:45.995
One, you have the shiny thing at the top,

08:46.080 --> 08:51.791
or - and this is the clever part -
you have the string at the top.

08:56.640 --> 09:01.077
Wowee! You haven't the slightest clue
what it's for, do you?

09:01.160 --> 09:06.188
Sure I do, grease stain.
You hold the shiny thing and go...

09:06.280 --> 09:09.397
Aow! The string's moving!

09:09.480 --> 09:13.359
Hey! Stop that thing! Catch that string!

09:15.760 --> 09:19.196
- Where is it?
- It's in scoop range, Arnold,

09:19.280 --> 09:21.316
It's a pod!

09:21.400 --> 09:23.994
Holly, bring it in!

09:27.280 --> 09:29.589
Yeah, yeah, yeah! I'm back!

09:29.680 --> 09:31.671
Feeling good! Feed me.

09:31.760 --> 09:35.070
I haven't seen you for ages. Where've you been?

09:35.160 --> 09:37.833
- Investigating.
- Got you some crispies.

09:37.920 --> 09:39.990
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

09:40.080 --> 09:43.356
I read the book. It's got a brilliant ending.

09:43.440 --> 09:45.635
I could hardly believe me nose.

09:45.720 --> 09:50.396
Forget that. Got you the one
you asked about. The Holy Book.

09:50.480 --> 09:52.357
Oh, great!

09:57.080 --> 09:59.071
Hey! Pictures!

09:59.160 --> 10:01.151
Yeah! That's a cat thing.

10:01.240 --> 10:06.314
In books, we have drawings
of things and call them "pictures".

10:06.400 --> 10:08.391
We have pictures, too.

10:08.480 --> 10:11.199
You monkeys are smarter than I thought.

10:11.280 --> 10:14.317
- This is me!
- That's not you. That's Cloister.

10:14.400 --> 10:18.279
He was the father of the cat people.

10:18.360 --> 10:21.511
- Who's that?
- That's him frozen in time.

10:21.600 --> 10:25.309
That's me in stasis.
That's what "frozen in time" is.

10:25.400 --> 10:29.791
- He did that to save Frankenstein.
- Frankenstein was my pet cat!

10:29.880 --> 10:33.031
Look, Lister, Cloister. Cloister, Lister! See?

10:33.120 --> 10:37.671
Listen, you stupid monkey,
Cloister's another name for God!

10:37.760 --> 10:41.469
That's what I'm saying. I am your God.

10:46.080 --> 10:48.958
OK. Turn this into a woman.

10:51.040 --> 10:53.634
- I'm serious.
- So am I!

10:53.720 --> 10:57.998
Look, Frankenstein was my pet cat, right?
And she was pregnant.

10:58.080 --> 11:03.757
I got put into suspended animation
for three million years.

11:03.840 --> 11:06.593
- You oversleep? So do I.
- No!

11:06.680 --> 11:09.752
I'm saying that over those three million years,

11:09.840 --> 11:13.515
your entire race evolved from my pet cat.

11:13.600 --> 11:18.071
Ah, I gotta go now, man,
but let's do lunch some time.

11:18.160 --> 11:22.392
I'll put it in my diary. "12.30, lunch with God. "

11:22.480 --> 11:25.199
Formal dress, you know what I'm saying?

11:25.280 --> 11:27.271
It is true, you know.

11:27.360 --> 11:33.071
Then the ultimate question
is, if you're God, why that face?

11:33.160 --> 11:36.311
- What's wrong with my face?
- What's wrong?

11:36.400 --> 11:41.155
It's upside down and inside out,
that's what's wrong with it. Aow!

11:41.240 --> 11:43.231
- Holly?
- Yes, Dave?

11:43.320 --> 11:47.393
If I give you my cat dictionary,
can you translate this?

11:47.480 --> 11:50.836
I'll give it a go, Dave,
I'll do it,

11:50.920 --> 11:52.911
You're a toaster.

11:53.000 --> 11:57.039
I'm packing it in,
I'm becoming something I don't like,

11:57.120 --> 12:00.476
- I'm not a moaner,
- No, you're a toaster.

12:00.560 --> 12:04.235
It just strikes me
that there might be something more,

12:04.320 --> 12:08.233
something unimaginably
more splendid than heating bread,

12:09.480 --> 12:11.471
Lister, it's arrived!

12:11.560 --> 12:13.994
- What has?
- The UO! It's a pod!

12:14.080 --> 12:15.832
- Where?
- The observation room.

12:15.920 --> 12:18.070
No point in running, Lister.

12:18.160 --> 12:21.550
It's mine. I found it. I've got bagsies.

12:21.640 --> 12:23.995
He's such a child, that boy.

12:28.160 --> 12:29.673
- Is it safe, Holly?
- Yes, Dave,

12:31.120 --> 12:33.429
No point in running. It's mine.

12:33.520 --> 12:37.069
Calm down. Dead people
can have heart attacks, too.

12:37.160 --> 12:40.357
- What is it?
- It's obviously some alien capsule,

12:40.440 --> 12:42.795
and clearly they're intelligent, Lister.

12:42.880 --> 12:47.954
The chance to meet an intelligent
life form after 18 weeks with you.

12:48.040 --> 12:50.998
OK, Mr Intelligence, what are those markings?

12:51.080 --> 12:55.039
Well, I don't know.
I don't speak alien, you gimboid.

12:58.240 --> 13:01.630
What are you doing? It's quarantined!

13:01.720 --> 13:05.554
You might get some
slimy thing stuck to your face!

13:05.640 --> 13:08.996
Of course it's safe. Come in. Come on...

13:18.440 --> 13:23.036
Ha-ha-ha Tee-hee
All right, we'll play it your way.

13:23.120 --> 13:26.556
But don't think you're coming out.
You're in quarantine.

13:26.640 --> 13:31.430
- What did you say, Rimmer?
- Why do you never do what I say?

13:31.520 --> 13:34.080
There's a reason why I'm your superior.

13:34.160 --> 13:37.914
You've been here 15 years,
I've been here eight months.

13:38.000 --> 13:40.798
No, it's because I'm better than you.

13:40.880 --> 13:43.474
Better trained, better equipped, better...

13:43.560 --> 13:47.155
Better. Just... better.

13:47.240 --> 13:49.435
So, everyone else is better than you.

13:49.520 --> 13:54.389
No, I'm not going to let you bait me.
This is too important.

13:54.480 --> 13:58.792
Just you wait here
till I get back with the skutters.

14:02.720 --> 14:05.792
Oh, Rimmer's such a smeghead, man.

14:08.040 --> 14:10.349
Hey, hang on a minute.

14:12.160 --> 14:14.196
Give me an R...

14:14.280 --> 14:16.999
Give me an E...

14:17.080 --> 14:19.355
Give me a D...

14:19.440 --> 14:22.716
Give me a Red Dwarf garbage pod!

14:24.200 --> 14:28.239
Holly? Did Rimmer never work
in waste disposal?

14:28.320 --> 14:29.912
No, Dave,

14:30.000 --> 14:34.516
It's one of our garbage pods
with the writing burnt off in places.

14:34.600 --> 14:38.878
- Why didn't you tell him?
- Well, it's a laugh, innit?

14:42.560 --> 14:45.836
After intensive investigation, comma,

14:45.920 --> 14:49.708
of the markings on the alien pod, comma,

14:49.800 --> 14:52.155
it has become clear, comma,

14:52.240 --> 14:54.231
to me, comma,

14:54.320 --> 14:56.311
that we are dealing, comma,

14:56.400 --> 14:59.915
with a species of awesome intellect, colon.

15:00.000 --> 15:03.913
Good, Perhaps they can help
with your punctuation,

15:04.000 --> 15:05.991
Shut up.

15:11.760 --> 15:13.557
Lights.

15:15.040 --> 15:17.679
Are you awake? Lister?

15:18.640 --> 15:20.437
Lister?

15:21.440 --> 15:23.237
Lister!

15:23.320 --> 15:26.278
- Are you awake?
- Yeah, yeah.

15:26.360 --> 15:28.828
Yeah, I couldn't sleep either.

15:28.920 --> 15:31.275
- It's the excitement.
- What excitement?

15:31.360 --> 15:33.920
- The alien excitement!
- Rimmer, it's garbage.

15:34.000 --> 15:38.630
You can scoff, Lister. They laughed
at Galileo. They laughed at Edison.

15:38.720 --> 15:41.393
- They laughed at Columbo.
- Who's Columbo?

15:41.480 --> 15:45.189
The man with the dirty mac
who discovered America.

15:45.280 --> 15:49.114
- What makes you think aliens exist?
- They must do, Lister.

15:49.200 --> 15:53.876
There's so many things
that we don't have an explanation for.

15:53.960 --> 15:59.592
Like why do intelligent people buy
cinema hot dogs? That sort of thing?

15:59.680 --> 16:02.240
No, Lister, I mean like the pyramids.

16:02.320 --> 16:06.359
How did they move such massive stones
without modern technology?

16:06.440 --> 16:09.591
They had massive whips, Rimmer.
Massive, massive whips.

16:09.680 --> 16:14.117
All right, then, the Bermuda Triangle.
Go on, explain that one.

16:14.200 --> 16:19.593
No, that is a genuine mystery.
How did that song ever become a hit?

16:19.680 --> 16:24.276
Why do I bother? I'd get more sense
out of a squashed hedgehog.

16:24.360 --> 16:28.717
Don't you ever wonder why we're here?
What's the grand purpose?

16:28.800 --> 16:32.952
Why does it have to be such a big deal?

16:33.040 --> 16:35.508
Humans might be a planetary disease,

16:35.600 --> 16:38.990
like Earth's got German measles
or facial herpes, right?

16:39.080 --> 16:42.993
That's why the other planets
give us such a wide berth.

16:43.080 --> 16:46.675
It's like, "Don't go near Earth,
it's got human beings!"

16:46.760 --> 16:51.390
So, you're saying, Lister,
you're an intergalactic, pus-filled sore?

16:51.480 --> 16:54.392
At last, Lister, we agree on something.

16:54.480 --> 16:57.950
What about you? Do you believe in God?

16:58.040 --> 17:00.713
Certainly not! What a preposterous thought!

17:00.800 --> 17:02.791
I believe in aliens, Lister.

17:02.880 --> 17:05.598
Oh, right, fine. Something sensible at last.

17:05.680 --> 17:11.550
Aliens with technology so advanced
we can't even begin to imagine.

17:11.640 --> 17:13.631
That's not difficult.

17:13.720 --> 17:17.473
Mankind can't even create a toupee
that doesn't get laughs.

17:17.560 --> 17:20.711
Aliens who can give me a real body.

17:20.800 --> 17:26.193
Ooh, I can't wait to see your face
in the morning, I really can't.

17:26.280 --> 17:28.919
Nor I yours, when that pod opens

17:29.000 --> 17:32.037
and from it emerges a beautiful alien woman

17:32.120 --> 17:35.078
with long green hair and six breasts.

17:36.480 --> 17:38.277
Six breasts?!

17:38.360 --> 17:41.636
Imagine making love
to a woman with six breasts!

17:41.720 --> 17:44.473
Imagine making love to a woman.

17:52.360 --> 17:55.397
Good morning, How can I help you?

17:55.480 --> 17:59.359
- Bonjour. Um, give me breakfast.
- What would you like?

17:59.440 --> 18:02.989
Er... chicken vindaloo and a milkshake.

18:03.080 --> 18:06.117
- What flavour milkshake?
- Um... beer.

18:08.080 --> 18:10.719
Morning, Dave,
I've finished your translation,

18:10.800 --> 18:15.555
- Who's Cloister? Is it me?
- Yes, The cats made you their god,

18:15.640 --> 18:18.871
Hey! Working-class kid makes good!

18:18.960 --> 18:24.478
Your plan to move to Fiji and open
a diner became their image of heaven,

18:24.560 --> 18:27.597
- What?
- "And Cloister spake,

18:27.680 --> 18:32.993
"'Lo, I shall lead you to Fuchal,
We shall open a temple of food,

18:33.080 --> 18:37.073
"'wherein shall be sausages
and all manner of bountiful things,

18:37.160 --> 18:40.277
"'Yea, even individual sachets of mustard,

18:40.360 --> 18:44.319
"'And those who serve
shall wear hats of great majesty,

18:44.400 --> 18:48.313
"'though they be made of cardboard
with humorous arrows, '"

18:50.600 --> 18:53.160
Does it say what happened
to the rest of the cats?

18:53.240 --> 18:57.392
Holy wars, thousands of years
of fighting between the two factions,

18:57.480 --> 19:00.916
- What two factions?
- The ones who wanted red hats

19:01.000 --> 19:03.275
and those who wanted blue hats,

19:03.360 --> 19:07.990
They had a war over whether
the diner hats were red or blue?

19:08.080 --> 19:11.993
Yeah, Most of them were killed,
It's daft really, innit?

19:12.080 --> 19:15.959
You're not kidding.
They were supposed to be green.

19:18.080 --> 19:21.038
- Go on, Hol.
- Finally, they called a truce,

19:21.120 --> 19:25.079
built two arks and left Red Dwarf
in search of Fuchal,

19:25.160 --> 19:28.869
But there's no such place.
How would they find it?

19:28.960 --> 19:31.599
"Cloister gave to Frankenstein
the sacred writing,

19:31.680 --> 19:35.434
"saying, 'Those who have wisdom
will know its meaning, '

19:35.520 --> 19:39.991
"And it was written thus;
seven socks, one shirt... "

19:40.080 --> 19:44.437
That's my laundry list!
I li ned the cat's basket with it!

19:44.520 --> 19:48.593
They thought it was a chart
leading to the promised land,

19:48.680 --> 19:51.672
Well, it wasn't. It was my dirty washing.

19:52.360 --> 19:54.351
What happened next, Hol?

19:54.440 --> 19:57.398
"And the first ark
followed the sacred signs,

19:57.480 --> 20:00.995
"and lo, they flew straight
into an asteroid,

20:01.080 --> 20:05.312
"The second ark flew ever onward,
knowing they were indeed righteous, "

20:05.400 --> 20:08.233
This is terri ble. Holy wars. Ki lli ng.

20:08.320 --> 20:13.030
They're using religion as an excuse
to be extremely crappy to each other.

20:13.120 --> 20:15.111
So, what else is new?

20:16.040 --> 20:18.031
I'm not interested.

20:18.120 --> 20:21.078
They killed each other over cardboard hats.

20:21.160 --> 20:23.594
- I'm not interested.
- Isn't it amazing?

20:23.680 --> 20:27.150
People who didn't eat hot dogs
on Fuchal Day

20:27.240 --> 20:29.913
were stoned to death by stale doughnuts.

20:30.000 --> 20:32.992
What should I say?
"Congratulations, you're God"?

20:33.080 --> 20:35.719
I'm talking about the suffering. People died.

20:35.800 --> 20:38.075
I mean cats... Cat people died.

20:38.160 --> 20:40.720
You're just rubbing my nose in it.

20:40.800 --> 20:45.476
I could've been God, given the lucky
show-biz break you had.

20:45.560 --> 20:50.714
- I don't want to be a god.
- Vomitisation! I don't believe it!

20:50.800 --> 20:53.997
"I'm God, but it's a drag. " Come on!

20:54.080 --> 20:57.311
I'm not a god! I've just been... misquoted.

20:57.400 --> 20:59.391
Anyone who reads meaning

20:59.480 --> 21:02.677
into any old gobbledygook
deserves everything they get.

21:02.760 --> 21:05.877
If I'd had eight socks on my list,

21:05.960 --> 21:10.909
or if I owned more than one pair
of underpants, they might've have been safe.

21:11.000 --> 21:14.037
I wish I could meet them and apologise.

21:14.120 --> 21:18.432
Well, that would look spectacular.
God returns in all his splendour,

21:18.520 --> 21:21.114
and says, "Sorry for the cock-up!"

21:21.200 --> 21:25.478
- I didn't ask to become their god!
- I didn't ask to be killed.

21:25.560 --> 21:28.597
Life's a bitch. Now smeg off, I'm busy.

21:28.680 --> 21:33.959
They just made stuff up. I'm supposed
to have given them five sacred laws.

21:34.040 --> 21:36.031
I've broken four myself.

21:36.120 --> 21:40.159
I'd have broken the fifth,
but there's no sheep on board.

21:40.240 --> 21:44.074
- Bye-bye.
- What sort of holy writ is this...?

21:44.160 --> 21:49.029
- "It is a sin to be cool. "
- I'm sick of hearing about cats!

21:49.120 --> 21:53.159
My concerns are more meaningful
than stupid smegging cardboard hats!

21:53.240 --> 21:55.356
I'm trying to decipher this!

21:55.440 --> 21:59.991
This is science. You can smirk,
but I believe the Quagaars...

22:00.080 --> 22:03.231
- Quagars?
- Quagaars! It's a name I made up.

22:03.320 --> 22:07.950
Double A. I believe the Quagaars
can give me a new body!

22:08.040 --> 22:11.191
- Never mind this tot, where's the Cat?
- Tot?!

22:11.440 --> 22:13.431
- Tot.
- Tot?!

22:13.520 --> 22:15.078
- Tot!
- Tot?!

22:15.160 --> 22:18.994
We'll see what's tot.
The quarantine period's nearly up!

22:19.840 --> 22:21.432
Bastard!

22:23.480 --> 22:25.277
Cat? Cat?

22:27.800 --> 22:29.791
Holly, where's the Cat?

22:29.880 --> 22:32.348
He's no longer in my supervision field,

22:32.440 --> 22:34.556
He's on the cargo decks.

22:34.640 --> 22:38.474
I lost him as he entered Supply Pipe 2*,

22:38.560 --> 22:41.393
Cat? Cat?

22:42.000 --> 22:44.230
Cat! Come on, Cat.

22:46.600 --> 22:49.478
Miaow! Come on, kitty, kitty!

22:50.560 --> 22:55.190
Cat, come on. The crispies are getting warm.

22:55.280 --> 22:57.396
Come on. Cat, come on.

23:00.000 --> 23:02.116
Aow! Yeah! Yeah-yeah-yeah!

23:02.200 --> 23:05.556
Hey, fellas! Yes, sir. I'm back!

23:05.640 --> 23:08.677
Feeling good! Feed me.

23:08.760 --> 23:11.149
You're always leaving. Where do you go?

23:11.240 --> 23:13.800
Investigating! See, I have these feet...

23:13.880 --> 23:17.316
- I'm dying.
- I'm telling you about my feet.

23:17.400 --> 23:21.393
- My investigating feet.
- Don't you hear me? I'm dying!

23:21.480 --> 23:24.040
Yeah, but I'm talking about my feet.

23:24.120 --> 23:29.592
Why should you listen to me,
a blind old priest that's lost his faith?

23:29.680 --> 23:33.036
I'm not listening. I'm talking about my feet.

23:33.120 --> 23:36.032
- What do you care?
- I don't care!

23:36.120 --> 23:40.033
You're the one who's dying.
Why should it spoil my evening?

23:41.560 --> 23:43.152
Cat?

23:45.240 --> 23:46.719
Cat?

23:50.840 --> 23:56.073
Ooh, when I get you,
I'm going to turn you into a kebab.

23:56.160 --> 23:58.879
Holly? Can you still hear me?

24:02.960 --> 24:04.439
Cat?

24:04.800 --> 24:06.199
Here.

24:06.920 --> 24:09.388
Burn the sacred hat.

24:09.480 --> 24:11.755
That's a fearsome hat.

24:11.840 --> 24:15.037
Burn it! It's a symbol of the lies.

24:17.920 --> 24:21.754
- It's burnt.
- All my life I've served a lie.

24:21.840 --> 24:25.355
Because you're not there, Cloister, are you?

24:25.440 --> 24:27.431
You've never been there!

24:28.480 --> 24:31.278
YOU DON'T EXIST!

24:34.760 --> 24:37.274
- Who's that?
- It is I, Cloister!

24:37.360 --> 24:41.353
- Who is it, boy?
- It's Cloister. I've returnethed.

24:41.440 --> 24:43.954
Is it him? Is it truly him?

24:44.040 --> 24:47.555
- Does he look like a king?
- A king?! Yeah!

24:47.640 --> 24:50.791
Is he wearing the doughnut
and golden sausage?

24:50.880 --> 24:52.313
Yeah!

24:52.400 --> 24:55.676
Then it truly is him!

24:55.760 --> 24:59.196
Oh, I've failed you, Cloister.

24:59.280 --> 25:02.158
All these years, I kept my faith.

25:02.240 --> 25:07.155
I wore the Holy Custard Stain
and the Sacred Gravy Marks.

25:08.200 --> 25:10.350
I renounced coolness,

25:10.440 --> 25:14.319
and chose the righteous path of slobbiness.

25:14.400 --> 25:18.234
But in the end, I failed you.

25:18.320 --> 25:22.711
Why didn't you go on the arks
with the other cats?

25:22.800 --> 25:27.078
They left us behind. The sick and the lame.

25:27.160 --> 25:29.390
Left us to die.

25:29.480 --> 25:34.838
But then the boy was born
to the cripple and the idiot.

25:34.920 --> 25:38.230
- What idiot?
- Your father, boy.

25:38.320 --> 25:43.394
- My father was a jellybrain?
- That's why he ate his own feet.

25:43.480 --> 25:45.152
I did wonder.

25:45.240 --> 25:50.155
As one by one we died, my faith died also.

25:50.240 --> 25:55.439
You tested me, Cloister, and I failed you.

25:55.520 --> 25:58.910
Oh, no, you didn't fail, old man. You passed.

25:59.000 --> 26:02.629
I'm giving you...
I'm giving you an A+ distinction.

26:03.760 --> 26:06.911
There's a place for me on Fuchal?

26:07.000 --> 26:11.152
A place? Got your own bathroom,
en suite, cork floors,

26:11.240 --> 26:14.949
your own barbecue on the patio,
a phone, everything!

26:15.040 --> 26:17.031
Oh! My hat!

26:17.120 --> 26:21.318
I've burned my sacred hat!

26:21.400 --> 26:23.391
No, you haven't!

26:26.400 --> 26:28.391
A miracle!

26:29.080 --> 26:34.234
This is the happiest day of my...

26:42.040 --> 26:45.510
Did I ever tell you about my investigating feet?

26:45.600 --> 26:48.273
Once, there was an old man...

26:57.200 --> 26:59.316
Well? Are you ready, Rimmer?

26:59.400 --> 27:01.391
Open it! Open it!

27:03.320 --> 27:07.108
- Well? What's there?
- Are you sure you're ready?

27:07.200 --> 27:10.192
Yes! Come on, you gimboid!

27:13.400 --> 27:19.077
Incredible! A stupendous moment
in my own personal history!

27:19.160 --> 27:23.870
The perfectly preserved remains
of a Quagaar warrior!

27:23.960 --> 27:26.190
Yeah, right, Rimmer. Absolutely.

27:26.280 --> 27:29.670
They must have looked something like...

27:29.760 --> 27:31.751
a roast chicken.

27:36.880 --> 27:38.677
# It's cold outside

27:38.760 --> 27:40.273
# There's no kind of atmosphere... #

27:40.360 --> 27:42.351
It's a garbage pod!

27:42.440 --> 27:45.557
# I'm all alone, more or less... #

27:45.640 --> 27:48.074
It's a smegging garbage pod!

27:48.160 --> 27:51.357
# Let me fly far away from here

27:51.440 --> 27:54.318
# Fun, fun, fun

27:54.400 --> 27:57.949
# In the sun, sun, sun

27:58.040 --> 28:01.316
# I want to lie, shipwrecked and comatose

28:01.400 --> 28:04.597
# Drinking fresh mango juice

28:04.680 --> 28:08.116
# Goldfish shoals, nibbling at my toes
