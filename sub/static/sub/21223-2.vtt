00:34.740 --> 00:36.070
Darling, I'm home.

00:36.120 --> 00:38.590
Oh, how was the air
ambulance this morning?

00:38.640 --> 00:41.630
Wonderful. I saved a man who'd
accidentally sat on a vacuum cleaner

00:41.680 --> 00:43.310
when he wasn't wearing underpants.

00:43.360 --> 00:44.950
Was it some sort of sex game?

00:45.000 --> 00:47.350
I don't judge people, I
just take them to hospital

00:47.400 --> 00:49.830
so they can have things
removed from their rectums.

00:49.880 --> 00:52.110
You are so lucky to be
helping people like that.

00:52.160 --> 00:53.910
But your royal visits help people.

00:53.960 --> 00:56.860
You give them the most important
15 seconds of their lives.

00:58.480 --> 00:59.550
Is everything all right?

00:59.600 --> 01:01.990
It's the RAF, I'm
suspended from all flying,

01:02.040 --> 01:04.790
they're saying I never completed
my basic helicopter training.

01:04.840 --> 01:05.910
Of course you did.

01:05.960 --> 01:07.230
- Didn't you?
- Yes.

01:07.280 --> 01:09.270
And no.

01:09.320 --> 01:10.470
I was fast tracked.

01:10.520 --> 01:13.110
It can take up to four years
to become a helicopter pilot

01:13.160 --> 01:14.190
and I did it in 13 weeks.

01:14.240 --> 01:16.470
You let them give you
preferential treatment?

01:16.520 --> 01:18.710
Well, you know the pressures
on a working royal's time.

01:18.760 --> 01:21.430
Of course, we'd never have had
that skiing holiday in Courcheval.

01:21.480 --> 01:24.070
Do you know what hurts the
most, that you didn't tell me.

01:24.120 --> 01:25.870
I just couldn't bear to see that face.

01:25.920 --> 01:27.350
That face you've got now that says

01:27.400 --> 01:29.190
"You're just an over privileged wanker."

01:29.240 --> 01:31.350
I don't think you're an
over privileged wanker.

01:31.400 --> 01:33.750
Thanks for saying I'm not
an over privileged wanker.

01:33.800 --> 01:35.390
It's time for me to put this right

01:35.440 --> 01:37.590
and complete my basic helicopter training.

01:37.640 --> 01:40.040
And anyway I have to, or I'll get a fine.

01:42.800 --> 01:45.190
I've just been bitten by
something in the garden.

01:45.240 --> 01:46.870
- Probably Terry.
- What?

01:46.920 --> 01:49.310
He's one of the Peruvian
tree lizards I've introduced

01:49.360 --> 01:53.150
to try and keep the greenfly
down since I banned pesticides.

01:53.200 --> 01:55.350
Mother nature will be far more effective.

01:55.400 --> 01:58.870
If I can't drink vodka out there,
what's the point in having a garden?

01:58.920 --> 02:02.150
- What are you up to?
- It's my proposal for a new range of stamps.

02:02.200 --> 02:04.790
It's me as a selection
of Greek and Roman gods.

02:04.840 --> 02:06.710
Second class I'm Poseidon,

02:06.760 --> 02:10.630
all the way up to £1.50 for
larger packages where I'm Zeus.

02:10.680 --> 02:12.510
The only thing you have
in common with Zeus

02:12.560 --> 02:15.310
is you've both got dodgy Greek relatives.

02:15.360 --> 02:18.110
But what would you do
if you had real power?

02:18.160 --> 02:22.870
I'd get them all, all up
against a wall and shoot them.

02:22.920 --> 02:26.200
- Who? - The Royal Institute
of British Architects.

02:27.360 --> 02:30.470
But there's a law that reins
us in called the Magna Carta.

02:30.520 --> 02:32.350
I call it the Fun Stopper.

02:32.400 --> 02:36.390
- Oh, yes. - Then there's the people,
we'd have to be popular as a couple,

02:36.440 --> 02:39.070
and you're about as popular
as a turd in a swimming pool.

02:39.120 --> 02:42.430
Yes, I just can't get the knuckle
dragging scum to take to me.

02:42.480 --> 02:45.550
For some reason they can't seem to
see past your horrible character.

02:45.600 --> 02:47.880
I have to do something
to make them like me.

02:49.160 --> 02:50.510
Something big.

02:50.560 --> 02:54.750
And news just in, 12-year-old
singing sensation Melanie Flowers

02:54.800 --> 02:57.830
is in urgent need of a kidney transplant,

02:57.880 --> 03:00.670
but her rare blood type,
AB BA AB negative,

03:00.720 --> 03:02.990
means a donor is highly unlikely.

03:03.040 --> 03:05.400
That's my blood type.

03:08.400 --> 03:10.030
Hello?

03:10.080 --> 03:12.910
Hi, Harry, any news from Meghan Markle?

03:12.960 --> 03:16.070
Ya, still in LA, still
smashing it in Suits.

03:16.120 --> 03:17.830
Are you all right?

03:17.880 --> 03:20.110
Oh, just feeling a bit old.

03:20.160 --> 03:22.070
Do you ever get that? Your youth's gone

03:22.120 --> 03:24.910
and all you've got ahead
is duty and responsibility.

03:24.960 --> 03:27.670
I was saying just that to
the guys at Laser Quest,

03:27.720 --> 03:30.590
but there's no point in moping,
it's taken my mind off Meghan.

03:30.640 --> 03:31.910
I've bought a nightclub.

03:31.960 --> 03:35.390
- You haven't? - I have, I'm
gonna make it the new Boujies.

03:35.440 --> 03:37.150
We had a laugh in those days, didn't we?

03:37.200 --> 03:39.430
- Yeah. - Do you remember
that time I dressed as a Nazi?

03:39.480 --> 03:41.670
Oh, which time? Luftwaffe SS or Gestapo?

03:41.720 --> 03:43.230
- U-boat Commander.
- Oh!

03:43.280 --> 03:46.110
Tell you what, why don't
you help me run it?

03:46.160 --> 03:50.080
Oh, Harry, it's a nice idea but I'm
so busy with all my royal duties.

03:51.480 --> 03:53.350
- Knock-knock.
- Watcher, Pips.

03:53.400 --> 03:55.510
Just training for my next triathlon.

03:55.560 --> 03:57.510
Got a new bike. Ah,

03:57.560 --> 03:59.030
cost more than a family car.

03:59.080 --> 04:01.670
Oh, do you want to bring it
in in case someone steals it?

04:01.720 --> 04:04.550
I don't care if they do, Johnny
buys them in batches of 12.

04:04.600 --> 04:06.430
Oh, hey, I've just bought a nightclub,

04:06.480 --> 04:08.470
I've been trying to get
Kate to help me run it.

04:08.520 --> 04:10.310
Oh, Kate's far too dedicated to do that.

04:10.360 --> 04:13.190
A royal bird trapped in a gilded cage.

04:13.240 --> 04:17.310
Whereas I'm an eagle, soaring
above, shitting wherever I like.

04:17.360 --> 04:18.990
Now come on, girls.

04:19.040 --> 04:23.280
Harry, I've changed my mind, I
will help you with your nightclub.

04:29.000 --> 04:30.070
Oh, no.

04:30.120 --> 04:32.110
- What is it?
- It's from MI5

04:32.160 --> 04:35.270
saying we've breached national
security by sending the DVD

04:35.320 --> 04:38.270
of Daddy setting fire to a
servant to You've Been Framed.

04:38.320 --> 04:39.910
So no £250?

04:39.960 --> 04:42.670
On top of being booted
off the sovereign grant.

04:42.720 --> 04:46.270
I still can't believe Auntie Anne
called our waitressing unprofessional.

04:46.320 --> 04:48.750
We got some of the food on to the plates.

04:48.800 --> 04:51.190
Maybe we should learn to
take criticism onboard.

04:51.240 --> 04:55.310
Like when Mummy stopped charging
£500,000 for meetings with Daddy.

04:55.360 --> 04:56.190
You're right.

04:57.640 --> 05:00.390
From now on, we're going to
be completely professional

05:00.440 --> 05:02.710
in everything we do.

05:02.760 --> 05:04.230
Harry's got a job for us.

05:04.280 --> 05:05.880
Tell him we don't work mornings.

05:09.240 --> 05:11.230
My name is Preston.

05:11.280 --> 05:14.990
The first thing you need to know
about me is I've got no testicles.

05:15.040 --> 05:17.270
Would anyone care to
speculate how I lost 'em?

05:17.320 --> 05:18.590
Was it an industrial accident?

05:18.640 --> 05:20.230
Drop and give me 20!

05:20.280 --> 05:21.870
Anyone else?

05:21.920 --> 05:24.070
It was shot off, in Iraq.

05:24.120 --> 05:26.030
Well, well, well.

05:26.080 --> 05:27.710
Wills Windsor.

05:27.760 --> 05:31.350
We go way back, this guy
here is a helicopter genius.

05:31.400 --> 05:32.790
Oh, I wouldn't say that, sir.

05:32.840 --> 05:36.150
And I want you guys to make his time here

05:36.200 --> 05:37.480
a living hell!

05:38.560 --> 05:39.750
What?

05:39.800 --> 05:42.350
You just said I was a helicopter genius.

05:42.400 --> 05:44.750
Who broke the rules and
skipped basic training.

05:44.800 --> 05:47.750
I didn't want to. They told me
my time was too valuable to waste.

05:47.800 --> 05:49.950
- I mean... - Oh, so this is
a waste of your time, is it?

05:50.000 --> 05:51.350
I do apologise, Your Highness,

05:51.400 --> 05:54.270
for dragging you away from
something more valuable.

05:54.320 --> 05:57.270
Like opening a bypass or
giving Ken Dodd a Knighthood.

05:57.320 --> 05:59.630
No, I'd much rather be here
training with you guys.

05:59.680 --> 06:01.750
Are you saying Doddy doesn't
deserve a knighthood?

06:01.800 --> 06:04.470
No, he's great, I mean, well, he
goes on a bit, but he's fantastic.

06:04.520 --> 06:07.230
- Why are we talking about this?
- So after 60 years in the business,

06:07.280 --> 06:10.070
Ken Dodd doesn't know how
to edit his own material,

06:10.120 --> 06:12.750
- is that what you're saying?
- No, you're putting words in my mouth.

06:12.800 --> 06:15.710
What we've got here, boys, is a man
who thinks that helicopter training

06:15.760 --> 06:19.430
is a waste of time. And that
Ken Dodd shows are too long.

06:19.480 --> 06:21.350
No, it's just people
do need to get trains.

06:21.400 --> 06:24.510
I think we know how we
treat men like that.

06:24.560 --> 06:27.280
I'll leave you to get acquainted.

06:30.760 --> 06:32.590
Right, Your Royal Highness.

06:32.640 --> 06:35.070
Hi, guys. Call me Wills.

06:35.120 --> 06:37.680
Nah. We're gonna call you fuckface.

06:39.560 --> 06:41.470
Oh...

06:41.520 --> 06:45.510
If all it takes to get little
Melanie back out there singing

06:45.560 --> 06:49.870
is the donation of one of my
kidneys, then I'm happy to oblige.

06:49.920 --> 06:53.240
Course without it, little
Melanie will surely die.

06:55.040 --> 06:58.510
Yes, your parents have probably
been keeping that from you.

06:58.560 --> 07:00.830
- Yes? - Are you worried
about the operation?

07:00.880 --> 07:04.950
No. The greatest honour a ruler
can have is to lay down a kidney

07:05.000 --> 07:06.590
for one of her subjects.

07:08.200 --> 07:10.750
Right, er, that's it,
let's wrap it up, shall we?

07:10.800 --> 07:13.710
Would His Royal Highness care to
comment on reports of a plague

07:13.760 --> 07:15.910
of mongoose in the
gardens at Clarence House?

07:15.960 --> 07:18.070
Yah, I don't know what
you're talking about.

07:18.120 --> 07:21.190
I certainly never introduced
mongoose to eat the snakes

07:21.240 --> 07:23.470
which I'd hoped would prey on the lizards

07:23.520 --> 07:27.630
which I mistakenly introduced
to eradicate the greenfly.

07:27.680 --> 07:30.070
I hope that puts your mind at rest.

07:30.120 --> 07:31.670
What about Camilla, eh?

07:31.720 --> 07:33.550
She's a jolly good fellow...

07:33.600 --> 07:35.070
♪ For she's a jolly good fellow

07:35.120 --> 07:36.630
♪ For she's a jolly good fellow... ♪

07:36.680 --> 07:38.230
Are you sure about this operation?

07:38.280 --> 07:40.470
You're not a young woman
anymore and you haven't been

07:40.520 --> 07:42.190
for many, many, many, many, many years.

07:42.240 --> 07:45.510
Yes, but who knows what might
happen before the operation.

07:48.160 --> 07:49.600
Get in the house!!

07:51.680 --> 07:52.910
There was a queue a mile long.

07:52.960 --> 07:55.630
So, do you want me to manage the staff?

07:55.680 --> 07:57.310
Actually, where are the staff?

07:57.360 --> 07:59.430
Oh, well, you're looking at them.

07:59.480 --> 08:02.230
Yes, thanks very much for
the opportunity, Harry.

08:02.280 --> 08:05.550
It's so nice to be
inside this time of year.

08:05.600 --> 08:07.710
OK. So who's going to do what?

08:07.760 --> 08:10.550
Well, we're gonna work on the
door because we're so good

08:10.600 --> 08:12.230
at judging fashion and trends.

08:12.280 --> 08:15.510
And I'm brilliant at drinking
so I'll be in charge of the bar.

08:15.560 --> 08:18.550
And I've been given the
most responsible job of all,

08:18.600 --> 08:20.670
handing out sweets in the toilet.

08:20.720 --> 08:23.230
Great. Oh, and what about a DJ?

08:23.280 --> 08:26.790
Oh, yah. I forgot to put that
add in the newsagent's window.

08:26.840 --> 08:28.030
Oh, hey, you could do it.

08:28.080 --> 08:30.550
- Me? - Yah, you always
made a mean mix tape.

08:30.600 --> 08:33.549
Oh, well, that was in my carefree 20s.

08:33.600 --> 08:35.429
I've got duties and responsibilities now.

08:35.480 --> 08:37.630
Well, bollocks to your
duties and responsibilities,

08:37.679 --> 08:40.590
I'm into this for two mil.

08:40.640 --> 08:46.150
One club! One club! Give
it to me now, dub-dub-dub...

08:46.200 --> 08:48.320
OK, just a sec.

08:57.200 --> 08:58.910
Just a moment.

08:58.960 --> 09:00.760
Perfect head shape.

09:04.280 --> 09:05.440
Have a great night.

09:07.400 --> 09:09.230
- Hello, girls.
- Mummy.

09:09.280 --> 09:11.750
Isn't it exciting, new
club opening in town.

09:11.800 --> 09:13.870
- What are you doing here?
- Well, what do you think?

09:13.920 --> 09:16.430
To drink champers and
flash my freckly bangers.

09:16.480 --> 09:18.870
- Great.
- Just one sec.

09:18.920 --> 09:22.390
We can't let her in, she
doesn't fit the club profile.

09:22.440 --> 09:24.230
But she's our mum.

09:24.280 --> 09:26.380
What about our new professional approach?

09:29.000 --> 09:31.360
I'm sorry, you're in too big a group.

09:32.560 --> 09:35.510
But it's just me. I'm on my own.

09:35.560 --> 09:36.630
I'm all alone.

09:36.680 --> 09:38.190
But she said,

09:38.240 --> 09:40.040
too big a group.

09:41.360 --> 09:42.860
I understand, girls, I'll go now.

09:45.760 --> 09:48.070
Sorry, girls, did you say something?

09:48.120 --> 09:49.400
No.

09:50.520 --> 09:51.960
Aargh!

09:58.160 --> 09:59.710
Um...

09:59.760 --> 10:02.320
Oh, thank you.

10:07.520 --> 10:09.230
Wills!

10:09.280 --> 10:10.910
What happened to your face?

10:10.960 --> 10:13.630
Well, I'm being systematically
bullied at work.

10:13.680 --> 10:15.270
Cos they think I'm stuck up.

10:15.320 --> 10:17.190
Well, we'll speak about it later.

10:17.240 --> 10:18.990
I've got to go and finish my set.

10:19.040 --> 10:20.870
Set?

10:23.000 --> 10:25.110
- Henry V.
- That's right.

10:25.160 --> 10:27.350
So you're not fitting
in with your comrades?

10:27.400 --> 10:30.790
No. Unless things change I don't
think I'll last the course.

10:30.840 --> 10:33.150
There's only one thing you
can do with men like these.

10:33.200 --> 10:35.910
Banter! It's the only thing they respect.

10:35.960 --> 10:37.630
Banter?

10:37.680 --> 10:40.030
I'm not sure I'm very good at being bawdy.

10:40.080 --> 10:42.070
Sometimes a king has to be.

10:42.120 --> 10:45.350
Like once, a common foot
soldier shouted at me,

10:45.400 --> 10:47.150
"Watcher, ginger pubes,"

10:47.200 --> 10:49.870
but instead of getting
cross, I simply replied,

10:49.920 --> 10:50.990
"Lucky they are ginger.

10:51.040 --> 10:53.670
"It makes them easier to pick
out of your mother's teeth."

10:53.720 --> 10:55.310
And that's what won us Agincourt.

10:55.360 --> 10:59.110
So I should just walk in
tomorrow and call them all twats?

10:59.160 --> 11:01.070
Um, I wouldn't open with it.

11:01.120 --> 11:03.150
Now I must go and cut some shapes.

11:03.200 --> 11:05.360
Once more unto the breach!

11:12.760 --> 11:14.230
Pippa!

11:14.280 --> 11:16.150
You seem to be enjoying yourself.

11:16.200 --> 11:17.390
Is Johnny with you?

11:17.440 --> 11:21.070
No, his company's just taken
over a thriving pottery firm

11:21.120 --> 11:23.550
and he's busy bulldozing
it to make a car park.

11:23.600 --> 11:25.240
Oh, oh, hang on a sec.

11:30.360 --> 11:32.670
Sorry about that, getting
really in to this.

11:32.720 --> 11:34.630
I had the whole crowd moving as one,

11:34.680 --> 11:36.550
I'm like some sort of mystical shaman.

11:36.600 --> 11:41.070
Mm, or someone who's just putting
on one record after another.

11:41.120 --> 11:42.950
There's more to DJing than that.

11:43.000 --> 11:45.390
Yes, well, there is all
that Jamaican to learn.

11:45.440 --> 11:46.870
Pippa.

11:46.920 --> 11:48.560
Hey, have you two ever kissed?

11:50.920 --> 11:52.630
Sorry I'm off my face.

11:52.680 --> 11:54.630
May I have the pleasure of this dance?

11:54.680 --> 11:57.800
You may.

12:05.720 --> 12:07.710
When did you become a DJ?

12:07.760 --> 12:10.630
Inside, I think I always have been.

12:10.680 --> 12:12.110
Really? Anyway, we'd better go,

12:12.160 --> 12:14.150
I've gotta get up early
to practise my banter.

12:14.200 --> 12:15.750
But I've got to do another set.

12:15.800 --> 12:17.870
Can't you just stick a record
on and leave them to it?

12:17.920 --> 12:21.350
No. I've got go like this with one
hand and then this with the other

12:21.400 --> 12:22.870
otherwise it's not the same.

12:22.920 --> 12:26.070
Apart from anything else, you've
got a full diary tomorrow.

12:26.120 --> 12:27.870
I can do this and my royal duties.

12:27.920 --> 12:30.670
No-one can be a full time
royal and a nightclub DJ,

12:30.720 --> 12:32.630
there simply aren't
enough hours in the day.

12:32.680 --> 12:34.640
Watch me. Two...

12:46.180 --> 12:48.370
What's the matter with you today?
Normally we can't get you out of the

12:48.420 --> 12:51.130
- garden. - Oh, I'm just
taking it in from here.

12:51.180 --> 12:53.450
It's got nothing to do with the
wolves you've introduced to eat the

12:53.500 --> 12:55.250
- mongoose, has it?
- No, no, no.

12:55.300 --> 12:58.400
And that's certainly not the
reason the gardener lost his arm.

13:00.060 --> 13:02.210
That press conference was a success.

13:02.260 --> 13:04.570
Camilla Parker Bowles over Britain.

13:04.620 --> 13:07.210
Yes, it's all going rather well.

13:07.260 --> 13:11.250
Oh, I see the brakes on little
Melanie's wheelchair failed.

13:11.300 --> 13:14.730
- Oh, dear. - Yes, and at the
White Cliffs of Dover, too.

13:14.780 --> 13:18.210
Goodness me, if a bystander hadn't
grabbed her she surely would've gone

13:18.260 --> 13:21.460
- right over the cliff.
- Yes, it's all very sad.

13:23.700 --> 13:27.330
What? You mean she survived?

13:27.380 --> 13:28.770
Yes. Good, isn't it?

13:28.820 --> 13:30.970
So I am going to have
to give her a kidney.

13:35.820 --> 13:38.090
They've picked up Simpkins' scent.

13:38.140 --> 13:40.490
Run, Simpkins, run!

13:40.540 --> 13:43.090
Not in here, man, use the tradesman's.

13:48.420 --> 13:50.700
Look who it is, Princess William.

13:51.700 --> 13:52.700
Right.

13:54.620 --> 13:55.720
I don't have a comeback.

13:57.900 --> 14:00.850
Shut up, you big hairy knob.

14:00.900 --> 14:02.530
If that's the best you can do,

14:02.580 --> 14:05.610
then that private education
was a waste of money.

14:05.660 --> 14:08.650
- I...
- Don't think.

14:08.700 --> 14:10.260
Feel, and it will come.

14:15.140 --> 14:19.410
Funny you want to be a pilot
because you are the definition of...

14:19.460 --> 14:20.730
And another thing...

14:46.580 --> 14:48.050
That was incredible.

14:48.100 --> 14:50.050
I've never heard banter like it.

14:50.100 --> 14:53.540
And just from the cuss-sweeping
abuse and psychological insight,

14:54.740 --> 14:58.540
- consider yourself one of the lads.
- That's all I ever wanted.

15:02.820 --> 15:06.810
Very touching. But that don't mean jack
when it comes to passing your basic training.

15:06.860 --> 15:10.410
And to do that each one of you got
to defeat me in the boxing ring.

15:10.460 --> 15:11.490
That's not on the syllabus!

15:11.540 --> 15:13.220
Do I look like I give a damn?!

15:14.820 --> 15:16.850
- Oh, you're in early.
- I haven't slept.

15:16.900 --> 15:19.850
I went straight from the club to a
breakfast meeting with British Netball.

15:19.900 --> 15:22.450
I've got 15 minutes to do tonight's
set list before having tea with the

15:22.500 --> 15:23.530
Potato Association.

15:23.580 --> 15:24.810
Do you make those set lists?

15:24.860 --> 15:27.130
I thought you just cut and
pasted them off Spotify.

15:27.180 --> 15:29.490
No. What's this?

15:29.540 --> 15:31.450
Harry!

15:31.500 --> 15:34.210
You've lost £1m in two days.

15:34.260 --> 15:35.450
Blimey, how did that happen?

15:35.500 --> 15:37.490
You haven't charged anyone for drinks.

15:37.540 --> 15:38.770
Do people pay for drinks?

15:38.820 --> 15:40.810
- 'Course they do.
- Well, I never have.

15:40.860 --> 15:43.810
One person drank £33,000-worth of vodka!

15:43.860 --> 15:45.130
Oh, yah, that was me.

15:45.180 --> 15:47.170
I thought I felt a bit... ugh.

15:47.220 --> 15:49.570
Harry, don't you understand
how serious this is?

15:49.620 --> 15:51.810
You're about to go out of business.

15:51.860 --> 15:54.570
- What?! - I said you're
about to go out... - No.

15:54.620 --> 15:58.460
Sorry, I think I just
heard an ice cream van.

16:07.340 --> 16:09.090
Mayfair 387.

16:09.140 --> 16:11.010
- I need your help.
- Who is this?

16:11.060 --> 16:12.210
You know who this is.

16:12.260 --> 16:14.890
'The club's in trouble. It
needs a cash injection fast.'

16:14.940 --> 16:16.490
Why don't you ask Wills?

16:16.540 --> 16:18.970
I can't, he doesn't approve of my DJ-ing.

16:19.020 --> 16:20.570
Oh, trouble in paradise?

16:20.620 --> 16:22.850
Well, who's got the shit relationship now?

16:22.900 --> 16:24.530
I never said anything
about your relationship.

16:24.580 --> 16:27.780
So you thought you'd come crawling
to your little sister instead?

16:29.300 --> 16:31.090
Oh, I suppose I could speak to Johnny.

16:31.140 --> 16:35.370
- Thanks. - But first, admit that
you're a bland goody-two-shoes head girl

16:35.420 --> 16:38.410
who secretly bores the tits
off everyone she meets.

16:38.460 --> 16:39.570
But that's not true.

16:39.620 --> 16:43.610
- It is, now say it.
- All right, Pippa, if that's what you want.

16:43.660 --> 16:46.370
I'm a bland goody-two-shoes head girl

16:46.420 --> 16:49.130
who bores the tits off everyone I meet.

16:49.180 --> 16:51.980
'Congratulations.' Harry's
little nightclub is saved.

16:56.620 --> 16:58.900
Thank you, Derek, now the other foot.

17:00.980 --> 17:02.090
Charles, I want you to know,

17:02.140 --> 17:05.970
if the worst should happen you
have my permission to remarry.

17:06.020 --> 17:10.170
I wouldn't want to. I'd be like
Queen Victoria after Albert died,

17:10.220 --> 17:12.650
go in to mourning for many, many years,

17:12.700 --> 17:15.250
and then perhaps when the pain has dulled,

17:15.300 --> 17:18.260
reconnect with Susan
George on Friends Reunited.

17:19.300 --> 17:22.609
- We're ready for you.
- Darling you can still back out.

17:22.660 --> 17:24.569
You don't need to have
the public like you.

17:24.619 --> 17:25.730
You're not David Beckham.

17:25.780 --> 17:27.089
I have my reasons.

17:27.140 --> 17:29.890
Better to reign in hell
than serve in heaven.

17:29.940 --> 17:32.770
You'll be in hell in a
minute if he gets it wrong.

17:32.820 --> 17:35.700
- Or heaven.
- Oh, be realistic.

17:41.380 --> 17:42.900
Sorry, no trainers.

17:43.980 --> 17:46.380
Judging people on their
appearance is such fun.

17:47.300 --> 17:49.770
Apart from that one time when
we turned away our own mummy.

17:49.820 --> 17:51.530
Stop it, Beatrice.

17:51.580 --> 17:55.730
Oh, Eugenie, we've become
professional, but at what price?

17:55.780 --> 17:59.850
Hello, girls, I mean, one, please.

17:59.900 --> 18:02.330
- Mummy? - I don't know
what you're talking about.

18:02.380 --> 18:03.650
I'm only 18.

18:03.700 --> 18:05.610
Mummy, we know it's you.

18:05.660 --> 18:06.730
Oh.

18:06.780 --> 18:11.130
I'm sorry, girls, I've made a
fool of myself again, haven't I?

18:11.180 --> 18:14.780
Why can't I accept it's not 1985 anymore?

18:16.700 --> 18:22.170
Don't be silly, Mummy, you're coming in, and
you're going to have the night of your life.

18:22.220 --> 18:23.820
Frankie says relax!

18:28.260 --> 18:30.290
Nice shorts, where d'you get them?

18:30.340 --> 18:33.770
- Help the Aged?
- No bantering's gonna help you here.

18:33.820 --> 18:37.250
And for the record, I got 'em from M&S.

18:37.300 --> 18:39.530
So, Queensberry Rules?

18:39.580 --> 18:40.580
Ugh.

18:43.540 --> 18:46.090
Isn't it great seeing
Mummy enjoying herself.

18:46.140 --> 18:48.300
Let's never be professional again.

18:50.860 --> 18:52.170
Kate, where have you been?

18:52.220 --> 18:54.530
The Cheltenham Gold Cup,
there was a Stewards Enquiry.

18:54.580 --> 18:56.250
Well, you can't DJ dressed like that.

18:56.300 --> 18:58.740
Yes, I can. Now give me my bass cans.

19:01.140 --> 19:03.850
Kate, Kate, maybe you
should take the night off.

19:03.900 --> 19:06.490
- You look done-in.
- I'm fine.

19:06.540 --> 19:07.780
Oh!

19:20.540 --> 19:24.940
- Is being a pilot worth this?
- It is to me.

19:25.980 --> 19:30.210
All you're good for is accepting
bunches of flowers from old ladies.

19:30.260 --> 19:32.020
How's this for a bunch of flowers?

19:34.340 --> 19:36.290
Ain't you forgetting something, boy?

19:38.100 --> 19:39.980
- It's Harry.
- Harry?

19:41.700 --> 19:43.770
Sorry, I can't talk right now.

19:43.820 --> 19:46.410
I'm in the middle of something.

19:46.460 --> 19:47.850
Kate.

19:47.900 --> 19:49.400
Something's happened to Kate.

19:54.620 --> 19:58.490
- One, two... - I'm coming. - .. three.

19:58.540 --> 20:01.490
Wills? You have to stay in
the ring for the full count,

20:01.540 --> 20:02.570
you're gonna pass.

20:02.620 --> 20:03.930
I've got to go.

20:03.980 --> 20:06.170
Nine.

20:06.220 --> 20:07.540
Ten?

20:10.340 --> 20:14.370
- I'm alive! - You always
say that when you wake up.

20:14.420 --> 20:17.570
But I haven't got any stitches.

20:17.620 --> 20:19.410
No, they didn't take your kidney.

20:19.460 --> 20:22.650
Oh, because I drink 40
units of alcohol a day?

20:22.700 --> 20:25.970
No, they ran a blood test and
found you had a tropical disease.

20:26.020 --> 20:27.210
How did I get that?

20:27.260 --> 20:30.850
Terry the lizard. The point
is your kidney's intacto,

20:30.900 --> 20:34.020
plus little Melanie bought
a kidney off someone else.

20:35.700 --> 20:37.900
Urgh, oh, lovely.

20:39.300 --> 20:42.330
Oh, it's just 80, I
thought we said a hundred?

20:42.380 --> 20:43.780
No, no, 80's fine.

20:45.020 --> 20:46.370
Urgh.

20:46.420 --> 20:48.890
Well, I can't wait to get home.

20:48.940 --> 20:52.290
Ah, you're going to be staying
here for the next 48 hours.

20:52.340 --> 20:54.290
Sweat out the old tropical disease.

20:54.340 --> 20:57.650
- What? - We haven't got the necessary
restraints at Clarence House.

20:57.700 --> 20:59.290
You'll be safer here anyway.

20:59.340 --> 21:00.930
Since the bears gained entry.

21:00.980 --> 21:03.970
- Bears? - They're the
wolves' only natural predator.

21:04.020 --> 21:06.810
But the poison will have taken
effect by the time you get home.

21:06.860 --> 21:09.810
I thought you'd banned
pesticides in the garden.

21:09.860 --> 21:11.660
We can't lose any more men!

21:13.300 --> 21:15.570
Which one of the staff's
the designated first-aider?

21:15.620 --> 21:17.610
- Kate.
- Oh.

21:17.660 --> 21:19.380
Kate? Get back, everyone.

21:21.780 --> 21:24.180
It's exhaustion!

21:27.220 --> 21:29.330
And what do you do for a living?

21:29.380 --> 21:31.850
Oh, Kate you're back, I'm sorry we argued.

21:31.900 --> 21:34.570
of course you should be a DJ if
that's what you really want to do.

21:34.620 --> 21:37.610
No, I realised something
when I was unconscious,

21:37.660 --> 21:40.450
it's time I put all my energies
in to preparing to be queen.

21:40.500 --> 21:43.130
After all, it could
happen as soon as 2050.

21:43.180 --> 21:45.810
You've always gotta get it in haven't you?

21:45.860 --> 21:48.930
I'm giving up the air ambulance,
I can be a full time royal, too.

21:48.980 --> 21:51.490
But you did pass?

21:51.540 --> 21:53.930
- No. - Was it because you
rushed here to help me?

21:53.980 --> 21:55.610
A gentleman never tells.

21:55.660 --> 21:56.810
Oh, Wills.

22:00.580 --> 22:02.050
Big borcha!

22:08.260 --> 22:11.930
Harry, I've just had some bad news,
you know that loan from Johnny?

22:11.980 --> 22:15.930
Well, it wasn't a loan. He now owns
the club and he just sold it to

22:15.980 --> 22:17.330
property developers.

22:17.380 --> 22:18.380
I see.

22:20.260 --> 22:21.900
And how does that affect me?

22:26.140 --> 22:29.970
I'm popular, and with
popularity comes power!

22:30.020 --> 22:31.530
Ha-ha-ha-ha!

22:31.580 --> 22:34.730
The sheep love me!

22:34.780 --> 22:36.410
Argh!

22:36.460 --> 22:38.530
Argh! Argh!

22:38.580 --> 22:41.580
That's visiting time over,
see you in 48 hours.
