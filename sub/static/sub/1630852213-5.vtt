- For the energy, Mary.

06:57.720 --> 06:58.959
It's fine.
Here.

06:59.040 --> 07:01.319
Choose the one you
like the most.

07:01.399 --> 07:02.240
CRIS: Wow, so smooth!

07:02.319 --> 07:03.759
- Just touching it is relaxing.
- [chuckle]

07:03.839 --> 07:04.720
- It is?
- Oh, yeah.

07:04.800 --> 07:05.639
Then I want a big one.

07:05.720 --> 07:07.879
I recommend taking
one that's smaller.

07:07.959 --> 07:09.279
Those are easier to put in.

07:09.360 --> 07:10.279
Put in where?

07:10.360 --> 07:11.959
In your vagina.

07:14.160 --> 07:15.240
- [laughing]
- Ah.

07:15.319 --> 07:16.319
Then I guess I'll just take

07:16.399 --> 07:18.000
this little one
here instead, okay?

07:18.079 --> 07:20.120
- Oh, sure.
- I want a bigger one.

07:20.199 --> 07:20.680
This one.

07:20.759 --> 07:22.319
I'm not putting anything
up my vagina.

07:22.399 --> 07:23.199
What were you expecting?

07:23.279 --> 07:25.480
It's called a freaking
"tantric retreat."

07:25.560 --> 07:26.480
Dude, I have no idea.

07:26.560 --> 07:28.120
I just saw photos
of women in the forest

07:28.199 --> 07:29.279
with flowers
in their hair

07:29.360 --> 07:31.120
and I thought it
looked relaxing, okay?

07:31.199 --> 07:32.879
- Let's go.
- What? Why?

07:32.959 --> 07:34.040
- Hey!
- No fucking way.

07:34.120 --> 07:35.879
We came and picked you up
in Tarazona!

07:35.959 --> 07:36.399
So what?

07:36.480 --> 07:38.120
Well, it's my bachelorette
and I don't want you to go.

07:38.199 --> 07:40.439
Are you guilt tripping someone
with depression?

07:40.519 --> 07:42.560
Wait!
Wasn't it just symptoms, Mary?

07:42.639 --> 07:44.680
They could lead
to depression, all right?

07:44.759 --> 07:47.480
Okay, Mary, honey,
we're already here.

07:47.560 --> 07:48.480
And it's peaceful.

07:48.560 --> 07:51.120
And it might help
fix your issue.

07:51.199 --> 07:53.439
Your pussy.

07:53.519 --> 07:54.639
Your pussy has issues?

07:54.720 --> 07:55.519
I'm completely fine,

07:55.600 --> 07:56.959
I just don't want
a stone up there, okay?

07:57.040 --> 07:58.199
I just wanna get out of here.

07:58.279 --> 07:59.199
All right, we either stick

07:59.279 --> 08:00.480
these rocks up our cunts, or...

08:00.560 --> 08:02.800
we go find a party in Lloret.

08:02.879 --> 08:05.720
[singing]

08:05.800 --> 08:07.120
[pop]

08:08.480 --> 08:11.160
[phone ringing]

08:11.240 --> 08:11.920
I'm sorry, Gari.

08:12.000 --> 08:15.079
- Hello, Con--
- I am sorry, I was peeing.

08:15.160 --> 08:15.800
Hi, Conchita.

08:15.879 --> 08:17.920
I've got an appointment
with Xosé now.

08:18.000 --> 08:19.560
- Uh, no.
- No?

08:19.639 --> 08:21.959
You're like,
super early, dude.

08:22.040 --> 08:23.639
I know, but-- but
can he see me now?

08:23.720 --> 08:24.680
He's in the kitchen.

08:24.759 --> 08:26.680
All right, I'll go
and look for him, okay?

08:26.759 --> 08:29.240
Okay.
Good luck, cutie.

08:38.120 --> 08:38.720
Hey.

08:38.799 --> 08:41.399
Um, they said
you were here.

08:41.480 --> 08:43.320
But didn't we say at six?

08:43.399 --> 08:44.320
Yeah, I got here early.

08:44.399 --> 08:46.120
And I've come here
to tell you

08:46.200 --> 08:49.200
that I want to change
my case worker.

08:50.320 --> 08:51.080
As a client here,

08:51.159 --> 08:55.080
I'm entitled to choose a
professional who provides--

08:55.159 --> 08:56.759
better support.

08:56.840 --> 08:58.320
All right?

08:58.399 --> 09:00.720
- If that's what you want--
- Yes, it's what I want.

09:00.799 --> 09:02.200
That's why I came here.

09:02.279 --> 09:04.480
But are you sure?

09:05.960 --> 09:08.519
It's been ten years, Gari.

09:08.600 --> 09:09.639
Yeah, but--

09:09.720 --> 09:10.480
But I-- right now,

09:10.559 --> 09:13.679
I don't want you
to be my case worker.

09:16.039 --> 09:17.720
Okay.

09:18.200 --> 09:21.159
And now, if you don't mind...

09:23.279 --> 09:26.759
Everything was awesome,
this whole time.

09:28.480 --> 09:30.360
Okay, bye.

09:33.639 --> 09:34.679
God.

09:34.759 --> 09:36.639
[sigh]

09:40.320 --> 09:43.039
INSTRUCTOR: We move
our hips, gently.

09:43.120 --> 09:44.600
[man clearing throat]

09:44.679 --> 09:45.720
That's good.

09:45.799 --> 09:47.240
STUDENT:
Look, your boyfriend!

09:47.320 --> 09:49.879
INSTRUCTOR: And then we make
circular movements

09:49.960 --> 09:51.240
on the ball.

09:52.240 --> 09:53.639
[door closes]

09:54.840 --> 09:56.600
MONI: Gari!

09:59.399 --> 10:00.120
Hello, Moni.

10:00.200 --> 10:01.720
So, didn't know you were here.

10:01.799 --> 10:02.720
You have a painting class?

10:02.799 --> 10:04.120
If you don't want
to be with me,

10:04.200 --> 10:05.000
you have to tell me.

10:05.080 --> 10:06.559
I don't like it when
you don't answer my calls.

10:06.639 --> 10:08.240
And I wasn't
in painting class.

10:08.320 --> 10:09.240
I was in Pilates, okay?

10:09.320 --> 10:13.440
Okay, but I do want
to be with you.

10:13.519 --> 10:14.519
Life's been kinda, you know,

10:14.600 --> 10:16.240
complicated for me lately.

10:16.320 --> 10:17.919
Yeah, I know that.

10:18.000 --> 10:19.279
But I'm your girlfriend.

10:19.360 --> 10:21.399
If you don't tell me
what's going on,

10:21.480 --> 10:23.120
how am I supposed
to help you?

10:23.200 --> 10:24.960
All right, sure

10:26.200 --> 10:27.519
I'm sad, okay?

10:27.600 --> 10:28.399
Why?

10:28.480 --> 10:29.000
Tell me,

10:29.080 --> 10:31.679
because you didn't pass
the driver's test?

10:36.200 --> 10:37.720
I can help you.

10:37.799 --> 10:38.879
Mm-hm.

10:38.960 --> 10:40.039
You goof.

10:40.120 --> 10:41.360
Next time just tell me things.

10:41.440 --> 10:44.399
I can help if I know what
you're going through.

10:44.480 --> 10:46.799
- Okay.
- Okay?

10:50.799 --> 10:51.960
I love you.

10:52.039 --> 10:53.240
I love you, too.

10:53.320 --> 10:54.759
I love you so much.

10:54.840 --> 10:55.799
Back at you.

10:55.879 --> 10:57.919
[bird chirping]

11:10.200 --> 11:12.799
Look.

11:15.519 --> 11:18.440
MONI: I didn't know
you liked birds.

11:18.519 --> 11:19.559
- Yeah.
- [bird chirping]

11:19.639 --> 11:22.799
My grandpa, he always
used to pick them up

11:22.879 --> 11:25.679
when they fell out
of their nests.

11:25.759 --> 11:27.919
Especially the...

11:28.000 --> 11:28.720
the smallest ones.

11:28.799 --> 11:32.159
- [bird chirping]
- Poor little things.

11:33.360 --> 11:35.399
GARI: We'll have
to give it a name.

11:35.480 --> 11:36.919
MONI: Uhh...

11:37.000 --> 11:39.039
Antonio Orozco.

11:39.799 --> 11:40.720
What do you think?

11:40.799 --> 11:42.120
[giggle]
Okay.

11:42.200 --> 11:43.039
That sounds great.

11:43.120 --> 11:44.799
- Hi, Antonio.
- [bird chirping]

11:44.879 --> 11:46.159
[chuckles]

11:51.159 --> 11:53.120
INSTRUCTOR: María,
Cristina and Esther

11:53.200 --> 11:55.279
thought they were coming
to a yoga retreat.

11:55.360 --> 11:56.399
[laughing]

11:56.480 --> 11:58.320
And not for tantric exploration.

11:58.399 --> 11:59.039
But relax,

11:59.120 --> 12:00.799
this isn't a class
about how to squirt

12:00.879 --> 12:04.159
or how to masturbate,
uh, better,

12:04.240 --> 12:05.200
that's all fantastic, right?

12:05.279 --> 12:06.200
And I highly recommend it.

12:06.279 --> 12:08.440
Those avenues are well
worth exploring

12:08.519 --> 12:09.559
but what we'll do is different.

12:09.639 --> 12:12.120
Tonight, we're going
to take a journey

12:12.200 --> 12:13.360
to find ourselves again

12:13.440 --> 12:15.120
and the energy of the womb.

12:15.200 --> 12:16.120
Hm? All right?

12:16.200 --> 12:17.440
Whether it's there
physically or not.

12:17.519 --> 12:21.200
And also to become reconciled
with our shadow selves, okay?

12:21.279 --> 12:24.600
That's something that's
a bit more difficult to do.

12:25.000 --> 12:26.600
I'll give you some
tools to help you

12:26.679 --> 12:28.120
and you'll make the decision

12:28.200 --> 12:29.799
if you're going to use these

12:29.879 --> 12:31.960
or not, and how.

12:32.440 --> 12:33.799
The first tool is stories.

12:33.879 --> 12:37.279
Because they use
the magic power of words.

12:37.360 --> 12:40.279
So, I'll read you a story.

12:42.159 --> 12:43.559
It starts like this:

12:43.639 --> 12:45.519
"Don't go into the forest.

12:45.600 --> 12:49.639
"Please, don't go out,
they said.

12:49.720 --> 12:53.519
"Why shouldn't I go into the
forest tonight?,' she asked.

12:53.600 --> 12:57.240
"There is a huge wolf
in the forest,

12:57.320 --> 12:59.799
"and it eats people like you.

12:59.879 --> 13:01.159
"Don't go into the forest

13:01.240 --> 13:03.440
"or you will encounter
a thousand perils.

13:03.519 --> 13:07.240
"This is my life,
not a fairy tale, she replied.

13:07.320 --> 13:11.159
"Something tells me
I must go into the forest

13:11.240 --> 13:12.279
"and meet the wolf.

13:12.360 --> 13:16.759
"Otherwise, my life...

13:16.840 --> 13:19.120
"is never going to change.

13:19.480 --> 13:20.960
"If you don't go
into the forest,

13:21.039 --> 13:23.039
nothing will ever happen."

13:23.120 --> 13:24.360
"And your life

13:24.440 --> 13:27.000
won't be able to start."

13:35.000 --> 13:36.039
And now, wild women,

13:36.120 --> 13:38.279
we'll go to the forest.

13:38.360 --> 13:40.360

- INSTRUCTOR: Yes.

13:40.440 --> 13:43.200
Honey, I think I'm going
to go back to the room.

13:43.279 --> 13:44.159
Wanna join?

13:44.240 --> 13:45.240
I figure I might as well stay.

13:45.320 --> 13:46.559
- Yeah?
- Since we're here.

13:46.639 --> 13:48.279
Okay, tell me
about it tomorrow.

14:01.559 --> 14:02.679
I'll ink you whenever you want.

Are you a tattoo artist
or what?

14:04.639 --> 14:06.000
Yeah, sure

It's amazing, dude.

14:09.399 --> 14:10.120
Here in Lloret,

14:10.200 --> 14:13.240
I just tattoo and feel super
connected to nature.

14:13.320 --> 14:14.480
It's like I've reconnected

14:14.559 --> 14:17.759
with the deepest part
of my being, you know?

14:17.840 --> 14:19.039
That's sweet.

14:19.120 --> 14:19.919
It's so sweet that--

14:20.000 --> 14:22.200
that you've found
your place, you know?

14:22.279 --> 14:24.960

14:26.000 --> 14:26.720
Isn't it a cactus?

14:31.559 --> 14:34.120
you learn more about
yourself in two hours

14:34.200 --> 14:35.440
than years of therapy.

14:35.519 --> 14:37.679
The trip is ridiculous

14:37.759 --> 14:39.720
All right.

15:21.039 --> 15:23.440
It's best if we walk
in silence,

because that way we connect

15:26.200 --> 15:28.799
with the energy in the forest.

Everything is fine.

16:03.200 --> 16:04.399
Thanks.

16:04.480 --> 16:06.440
Good night, then.

16:09.320 --> 16:11.759

another finger inside you..."

16:28.639 --> 16:29.759

16:29.840 --> 16:32.399
MARIA: Oh, were you
touching yourself?

16:32.480 --> 16:33.360
No.

16:33.440 --> 16:34.240
[chuckles]

16:34.320 --> 16:36.080
Weren't you going to the forest?

16:36.159 --> 16:38.240
No, it was cold and dark.

16:38.320 --> 16:39.279
Where did Esther go?

16:39.360 --> 16:42.080
- She wasn't with us.
- No idea where she is.

16:42.159 --> 16:42.799
[phone chimes]

16:42.879 --> 16:44.200
Damnit, I bet she's
run off somewhere.

16:44.279 --> 16:47.240
PABLO: "Darling, you don't know
how much I miss you..."

16:47.320 --> 16:48.000
[sigh]

16:48.080 --> 16:49.919
Are you chatting
with that guy?

16:50.000 --> 16:51.679
No, it's a message from Pablo.

16:51.759 --> 16:53.320
What did he say?

16:53.399 --> 16:55.440
Nothing, it's just kid stuff.

16:55.519 --> 16:57.320
Okay, good night.

16:57.399 --> 16:59.080
CRIS: Night-night.

17:05.200 --> 17:06.759
CRIS: "I'm crazy
about you, Álex,

17:06.839 --> 17:09.640
I wanna share
everything with you!"

17:12.559 --> 17:14.319

17:27.200 --> 17:29.000
ESTHER:<i>Guys...</i>

17:29.079 --> 17:30.720
I'm beginning to see the truth.

17:30.799 --> 17:31.960
<i>There's so much</i>
<i>clarity...</i>

17:32.039 --> 17:36.039
<i>I'm on a fucking</i>
<i>mind-bending trip, dudes!</i>

17:36.119 --> 17:37.119
<i>I'm gonna stay</i>
<i>here, okay?</i>

17:37.200 --> 17:40.000
<i>See you when</i>
<i>you finish the retreat.</i>

17:41.240 --> 17:43.000
- Well...
- Honestly...

17:43.079 --> 17:44.559
I'm in shock right now.

17:44.640 --> 17:45.599
[phone chimes]

17:45.680 --> 17:47.680
ESTHER:Oh, and bring me
my wallet.

17:47.759 --> 17:49.519
<i>I think I left it there.</i>

17:49.599 --> 17:51.440
- [sigh]
- Jesus.

17:51.519 --> 17:52.920
I can't believe it.

17:53.000 --> 17:54.640
I mean first,
she drags me here,

17:54.720 --> 17:55.640
and then abandons me.

17:55.720 --> 17:57.319
And she wants me
to find her wallet?

17:57.400 --> 17:58.559
I feel super anxious right now.

17:58.640 --> 18:01.440
Well, just relax,
it'll be okay.

18:02.039 --> 18:03.960
Oh, hey, Mary,
I want to ask--

18:04.039 --> 18:04.519
What?

18:04.599 --> 18:06.319
So say that last night
I sent a message

18:06.400 --> 18:08.440
and he still hasn't
replied to it

18:08.519 --> 18:11.599
texting again would be
super thirsty, right?

18:11.680 --> 18:14.400
- What was the message?
- Yeah, it'd be too thirsty

18:14.480 --> 18:16.440
I can't breathe.

18:16.519 --> 18:17.720
I'm getting breakfast.

18:17.799 --> 18:19.240
Okay...

18:23.039 --> 18:24.359
Were there emojis?

18:24.440 --> 18:24.960
Yes.

18:25.039 --> 18:27.119
That's super thirsty,
don't text him.

18:27.200 --> 18:28.240
I knew it!

18:28.319 --> 18:29.279
Hey, wait for me.

18:29.359 --> 18:30.200
Wait, I'm coming too.

18:30.279 --> 18:31.200
I know dad, but I mean,

18:31.279 --> 18:33.119
it was the--
the veterinarian who--

18:33.200 --> 18:34.200
who said we should take it

18:34.279 --> 18:36.240
to the bird sanctuary
right now.

18:36.319 --> 18:42.039
No, because the-- the sanctuary
can only be reached in a car.

18:44.799 --> 18:45.920
[sighs]

18:46.000 --> 18:47.119
Talk to you later.

18:47.200 --> 18:48.079
If I had a license--

18:48.160 --> 18:51.920
then we-- then we could
go there by car.

18:52.319 --> 18:54.200
- Who are you calling?
- It's Xosé.

18:54.279 --> 18:56.359
If you call him,
you can go by yourself.

18:56.440 --> 18:59.400
Because--
I'm not going, okay?

18:59.480 --> 19:00.440
[sigh]

19:00.519 --> 19:02.440
[bird chirping]

19:10.279 --> 19:13.359

19:14.319 --> 19:17.400
MARÍA DEL PILAR:Hiya!
Look who's here, Juanito!

19:17.480 --> 19:18.359
<i>It's daddy!</i>

19:18.440 --> 19:19.400
Hi, there, Juanito!

19:19.480 --> 19:20.880
<i>We've just arrived</i>
<i>at María's home.</i>

19:20.960 --> 19:24.200
<i>We wanted to come before</i>
<i>the wedding to relax a bit.</i>

19:24.279 --> 19:25.359
<i>Do you want to</i>
<i>see Juanito?</i>

19:25.440 --> 19:27.680
I-- I need to go do a thing,
María del Pilar.

19:27.759 --> 19:29.200
I'll-- I'll call you
when I'm done, okay?

19:29.279 --> 19:33.119
<i>Okay! You can come</i>
<i>and bathe him if you want.</i>

19:33.200 --> 19:33.880
Hey, uh, Gari.

19:33.960 --> 19:35.200
I can take you
there on the way back.

19:35.279 --> 19:36.680
<i>- What? </i>- Sorry, Ma--
María del Pilar.

19:36.759 --> 19:39.079
Look, I don't think
I'll be able to make it.

19:39.160 --> 19:40.799
Uh, I'll--
I'll call you back.

19:40.880 --> 19:43.400
- See you soon.
<i>- Bye, bye, hon.</i>

19:43.480 --> 19:45.519
Why don't you want
to see Juanito?

19:45.599 --> 19:47.240
You're not my counselor.

19:47.319 --> 19:50.160
- Okay?
- Okay.

19:51.200 --> 19:54.160
We're used to showing
our vulva and vagina

19:54.240 --> 19:56.240
when we go for a checkup
at the gynecologist.

19:56.319 --> 19:57.599
But we never
really spend time

19:57.680 --> 19:58.920
taking a good look
at ourselves.

19:59.000 --> 20:01.480
And there are women who feel
conflicted about looking.

20:01.559 --> 20:03.119
We've been taught
that it's ugly,

20:03.200 --> 20:04.039
that it smells bad--

20:04.119 --> 20:05.319
I panic when someone
eats me out

20:05.400 --> 20:06.599
without turning
the lights off.

20:06.680 --> 20:07.640
- Right.
- [soft laugh]

20:07.720 --> 20:08.799
Well, I just don't let them.

20:08.880 --> 20:09.680
[laughing]

20:09.759 --> 20:11.680
Well, I-- I have a complex.

20:11.759 --> 20:12.799
'Cause I don't have much hair.

20:12.880 --> 20:15.240
What's the matter?
Do you get embarrassed?

20:15.319 --> 20:16.119
Yes.

20:16.200 --> 20:17.640
Well, we had our daughter.

20:17.720 --> 20:19.400
Well, Ana,
had our daughter.

20:19.480 --> 20:21.480
And we went through
a process...

20:21.559 --> 20:24.119
Uh, personally,
it was difficult for...

20:24.200 --> 20:25.160
me to look at it, right?

20:25.240 --> 20:27.640
I could tell it had--
that it had changed.

20:27.720 --> 20:28.559
- Yeah?
- Right.

20:28.640 --> 20:30.400
INSTRUCTOR: How long
did that process last?

20:30.480 --> 20:31.559
It took me about...

20:31.640 --> 20:32.440
- A year.
- A year?

20:32.519 --> 20:33.799
- Yeah.
- INSTRUCTOR: That's incredible.

20:33.880 --> 20:36.119
- Okay, beautiful ladies.
- [laughing]

20:36.200 --> 20:37.000
The time has come.

20:37.079 --> 20:38.119
I'm going
to hand out mirrors

20:38.200 --> 20:40.559
and we are going to peek
at our vulvas.

20:40.640 --> 20:42.319
- INSTRUCTOR: All right?
- Okay.

20:42.400 --> 20:44.079
Our beautiful and
marvelous vulvas.

20:44.160 --> 20:46.079
- Yoo-hoo!
- Here we go.

20:46.160 --> 20:47.200
A mirror for each one of you.

20:47.279 --> 20:48.559
I'm going to the bathroom
for a sec...

20:48.640 --> 20:49.880
INSTRUCTOR:
Yes, yes, of course.

20:49.960 --> 20:52.720
The important thing is to
feel comfortable.

20:53.599 --> 20:55.319
[sighs]

20:58.039 --> 21:00.119
VET: And you brought him
all the way from Barcelona?

21:00.200 --> 21:02.240
- MONI: Yes.
- VET: Gosh, that's cool.

21:02.319 --> 21:05.759
Well, it looks like Antonio
has an injured wing.

21:05.839 --> 21:08.440
Does that mean he won't
be able to fly anymore?

21:08.519 --> 21:10.519
- No, he'll be fine in a week.
- Oh.

21:10.599 --> 21:14.519
Would he have died
if we hadn't brought him to you?

21:14.599 --> 21:15.920
Possibly.

21:16.000 --> 21:18.160
Thanks for bringing him.

21:18.839 --> 21:20.200
What's up, cutie pie?

21:20.279 --> 21:21.279
[bird chirping]

21:21.359 --> 21:22.680
[door creaking]

21:22.759 --> 21:24.640
We saved a life today.

21:24.720 --> 21:25.759
Give me five.

21:25.839 --> 21:27.960
Give me five... What's wrong?

21:28.319 --> 21:31.920
We saved a life because
Xosé brought us here.

21:32.000 --> 21:32.759
So what?

21:32.839 --> 21:36.480
You and I could never have
gotten here by ourselves.

21:36.559 --> 21:39.160
But the important
thing is we did.

21:39.240 --> 21:40.240
Can you open it, please?

21:40.319 --> 21:42.079
No, no, don't open it.

21:43.240 --> 21:45.079
What's the matter?

21:46.680 --> 21:48.799
[exhales sharply]

21:49.279 --> 21:51.720
I don't want to have
a disability.

21:51.799 --> 21:52.960
Don't say that.

21:53.039 --> 21:53.799
But it's true.

21:53.880 --> 21:56.240
If I can't even
get my-- my license,

21:56.319 --> 21:58.240
how can I be a dad?

21:58.319 --> 21:59.400
I'm sick of it,

21:59.480 --> 22:00.599
I'm-- I'm pathetic.

22:00.680 --> 22:01.480
No, you're not pathetic.

22:01.559 --> 22:03.559
And honestly,
fuck anyone who says so.

22:03.640 --> 22:04.440
Yes, we're disabled,

22:04.519 --> 22:06.599
but we are able to do
so many things.

22:06.680 --> 22:10.200
You don't have to prove
a thing to anyone.

22:10.279 --> 22:12.440
You have value.

22:14.279 --> 22:16.599
You're not gonna say anything?

22:17.279 --> 22:21.720
I don't think I am the right
person to give advice on this.

22:21.799 --> 22:22.599
Why?

22:22.680 --> 22:24.759
Because of María?

22:24.839 --> 22:26.200
What's up with María?

22:26.279 --> 22:27.720
Well, we broke up.

22:27.799 --> 22:32.400
But don't worry, it has
nothing to do with you, okay?

22:32.480 --> 22:34.160
Then why?

22:35.319 --> 22:37.160
Well...

22:37.759 --> 22:39.799
Because I'm a coward.

22:41.759 --> 22:44.359
I got freaked out and, um...

22:44.440 --> 22:46.000
And I ran away, like always.

22:46.079 --> 22:49.240
I'm not as brave as you are.

22:49.720 --> 22:51.640
I mean, shit,
you took the exam.

22:51.720 --> 22:53.799
That's fucking awesome.

22:55.359 --> 22:56.960
Can I give you
a piece of advice?

22:57.039 --> 22:59.400
Just one,
then I'll be quiet.

22:59.480 --> 23:00.400
As a friend,

23:00.480 --> 23:01.599
not as a counselor.

23:01.680 --> 23:05.559
Keep being brave
and go see Juanito.

23:07.119 --> 23:08.079
He didn't do anything.

23:08.160 --> 23:10.240
Don't quit seeing him

23:10.319 --> 23:13.480
He fucking loves you,
you can tell, man.

23:15.680 --> 23:16.279
Okay.

23:16.359 --> 23:18.880
Whenever you're ready, we'll go.

23:22.960 --> 23:24.720
[car door opens]

23:26.519 --> 23:27.599

23:27.680 --> 23:29.880
Are you all right?

23:29.960 --> 23:32.880
[engine starts]

23:45.759 --> 23:46.640
What are you doing here?

23:46.720 --> 23:48.880
Oh, babe,
I texted him.

23:48.960 --> 23:50.079
I think it made it worse.

23:50.160 --> 23:51.000
But I told you not to.

23:51.079 --> 23:52.240
Well, yeah, but I did.

23:52.319 --> 23:53.119
Can I tell you about it?

23:53.200 --> 23:54.279
Distract you
from your drama?

23:54.359 --> 23:57.279
So we've been sending each
other sexy messages, right?

23:57.359 --> 23:57.920
Okay.

23:58.000 --> 23:59.160
And last night I wrote:

23:59.240 --> 24:00.119
"I'm crazy about you,

24:00.200 --> 24:02.519
"I wanna share
everything with you."

24:02.599 --> 24:03.119
Okay?

24:03.200 --> 24:05.240
Perhaps "everything"
was a bit excessive?

24:05.319 --> 24:06.319
It's just a word, babe.

24:06.400 --> 24:08.119
Come on, María,
focus, okay?

24:08.200 --> 24:09.079
Okay, let me see.

24:09.160 --> 24:10.559
- Hey!
- Listen to me for a sec.

24:10.640 --> 24:11.480
Let's go to Barcelona.

24:11.559 --> 24:13.000
Let's go get Esther
from who knows where,

24:13.079 --> 24:14.039
and I can relax at my house.

24:14.119 --> 24:16.559
- María, give me my phone.
- Go to Barcelona, and I will.

24:16.640 --> 24:17.319
Are you a child?

24:17.400 --> 24:18.960
- Just give me my phone.
- All right, sorry.

24:19.039 --> 24:20.119
You're right.
I was impulsive.

24:20.200 --> 24:22.480
All right, but let me finish,
I wasn't done.

24:22.559 --> 24:24.119
I know he's been online,
I've seen him.

24:24.200 --> 24:25.119
He was last seen online

24:25.200 --> 24:26.000
at 5:45 last night,

24:26.079 --> 24:27.400
which was after
he sent that message.

24:27.480 --> 24:28.160
I know he saw it.

24:28.240 --> 24:29.119
Okay, Cris, one second.

24:29.200 --> 24:30.039
Give me my phone, María.

24:30.119 --> 24:31.599
- This guy is a douchebag
- [sucking teeth]

24:31.680 --> 24:33.079
If he didn't reply to that
beautiful message

24:33.160 --> 24:33.920
he's not worth it.
