WEBVTT

01:35.560 --> 01:36.740
Cooper, it's open.

01:36.840 --> 01:37.780
It's open?

01:37.880 --> 01:38.927
Come on!

01:40.640 --> 01:42.165
It's supposed to be awesome.

01:42.880 --> 01:46.660
- Thank you.
- Hey, give me back my quarters, you hoser!

01:46.760 --> 01:48.125
Mom!

02:42.240 --> 02:43.241
Damn.

02:44.440 --> 02:45.441
What?

02:47.640 --> 02:48.721
I suck.

02:56.800 --> 02:57.801
Wow, Sam.

02:58.440 --> 03:02.380
How are you so good at this?
You've never even played it before.

03:02.480 --> 03:03.606
I don't know.

03:04.520 --> 03:06.887
There's a pattern to how they're moving.
Watch.

03:09.880 --> 03:12.645
I don't see it, but you sure as hell do.

03:37.960 --> 03:41.487
Use the Force. Use the Force.

03:49.640 --> 03:50.880
Hey, Chewie.

03:51.000 --> 03:52.500
You're a superstar, dude.

03:52.600 --> 03:54.409
And it's time to show the world.

04:07.320 --> 04:08.860
<i>Attention, all contestants.</i>

04:08.960 --> 04:11.566
<i>The competition will start
in 15 minutes.</i>

04:12.800 --> 04:16.122
You too? That's so funny.

04:17.800 --> 04:18.880
Really?

04:19.160 --> 04:22.084
I think you're pretty darn
foxy yourself.

04:26.600 --> 04:29.922
Lady Lisa, I'll love you
till the end of time.

04:30.040 --> 04:31.980
- Who are you talking to?
- Nobody!

04:32.080 --> 04:33.140
We'll talk later.

04:33.240 --> 04:35.580
You're Ludlow Lamonsoff,
the Wonder Kid, right?

04:35.680 --> 04:37.900
Who told you that? The government?

04:38.000 --> 04:41.368
'Cause I'm this close to figuring out
the secret of the Bermuda Triangle.

04:41.840 --> 04:43.940
Wow, you don't have any friends, do you?

04:44.040 --> 04:45.610
Just my grandma.

04:48.880 --> 04:51.281
Well, Wonder Kid,
you can hang out with us.

04:51.640 --> 04:53.051
Really?

04:56.080 --> 04:58.460
What's up, geeks and goobers?

04:58.560 --> 05:00.900
They call me the Fire Blaster!

05:01.000 --> 05:02.940
'Cause my hands are blazing fast,

05:03.040 --> 05:07.364
and also I will blast and burn
all my competitors' weak-ass moves.

05:13.560 --> 05:15.580
You must be the local talent.

05:15.680 --> 05:19.241
If this was a fugly contest,
I'd be in trouble.

05:19.560 --> 05:21.620
At least we didn't make up
our own nicknames, Fire Blaster.

05:21.720 --> 05:23.740
Who cares who came up with it?

05:23.840 --> 05:25.740
It's totally tubular.

05:25.840 --> 05:29.460
<i>Welcome, gamers, to the first annual</i>

05:29.560 --> 05:33.690
<i>Worldwide Video Arcade Championships!</i>

05:34.720 --> 05:38.980
<i>Tonight, we have representatives here
from the</i> Guinness Book of World Records,

05:39.080 --> 05:42.460
<i>as well as NASA, the National Aeronautics
and Space Administration,</i>

05:42.560 --> 05:44.980
<i>who will be videotaping
tonight's competition</i>

05:45.080 --> 05:49.369
<i>to be included in a compilation of 1982's
news events and popular culture.</i>

05:49.720 --> 05:53.060
<i>That videotape will be placed
in a space probe</i>

05:53.160 --> 05:56.220
<i>which will be launched by NASA
into our solar system</i>

05:56.320 --> 05:59.380
<i>with the hope of connecting to,
and perhaps providing a message for</i>

05:59.480 --> 06:02.450
<i>extraterrestrial life, should it exist.</i>

06:02.720 --> 06:03.900
It exists.

06:04.000 --> 06:06.100
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

06:06.200 --> 06:09.249
<i>start your gaming!</i>

06:20.560 --> 06:23.660
<i>All right, ladies and gentlemen,
what an evening we have had here.</i>

06:23.760 --> 06:26.420
<i>Six new US records set.</i>

06:26.520 --> 06:28.980
<i>Three new world records set.</i>

06:29.080 --> 06:34.580
<i>And, as the smoke clears,
right now we have a tie.</i>

06:34.680 --> 06:39.380
<i>Two hundred and fifty-nine points
for your new</i> Pac-Man <i>world champion.</i>

06:39.480 --> 06:41.767
<i>The Fire Blaster, Eddie Plant!</i>

06:42.520 --> 06:44.340
Go, Fire Blaster!

06:44.440 --> 06:46.220
<i>And 259 points</i>

06:46.320 --> 06:49.980
<i>for your new Galaga Centipede
world champion, rookie sensation,</i>

06:50.080 --> 06:51.764
<i>Sam Brenner!</i>

06:53.320 --> 06:54.367
Yeah, Sam!

06:56.960 --> 06:59.740
<i>Well, gentlemen,
how 'bout we break this tie.</i>

06:59.840 --> 07:00.860
<i>Let's play</i>

07:00.960 --> 07:03.281
<i>Donkey Kong!</i>

07:07.520 --> 07:09.700
- Good luck, man.
- Thanks.

07:09.800 --> 07:12.041
You have the patterns down pretty good
with these games.

07:12.160 --> 07:13.764
You're gonna be tough to beat.

07:51.080 --> 07:53.048
You see, the thing about <i>Donkey Kong</i> is,

07:53.160 --> 07:57.006
at the higher levels the barrels become
more random, possessed almost.

07:57.120 --> 07:59.740
And playing by the patterns
doesn't do the trick anymore.

07:59.840 --> 08:01.126
Does it, Brenner?

08:21.280 --> 08:22.327
Congratulations.

08:24.600 --> 08:26.921
On coming in second!

08:31.000 --> 08:33.020
Fire Blaster is the world champ!

08:33.120 --> 08:36.539
The local yokel looked destiny
in the eye and blinked.

08:36.640 --> 08:40.140
He's a loser,
and he will always be a loser.

08:40.240 --> 08:41.539
Sam!

08:41.640 --> 08:43.380
Sam, Sam, wait.

08:43.480 --> 08:44.460
Sam, listen.

08:44.560 --> 08:45.980
You're still gonna go to MIT

08:46.080 --> 08:48.060
and invent something
that makes you a millionaire.

08:48.160 --> 08:50.242
And maybe even marry Olivia Newton-John.

08:52.360 --> 08:54.500
I was actually thinking Samantha Fox.

08:54.600 --> 08:56.443
Nice, but she's no Sheena Easton.

08:57.480 --> 08:58.700
Well,

08:58.800 --> 09:00.484
there's always Madonna.

09:01.000 --> 09:02.500
How about Scarlett Johansson?

09:02.600 --> 09:04.140
So hot.

09:04.240 --> 09:06.660
Not Halle Berry hot, but so, so hot.

09:06.760 --> 09:08.046
And don't forget Katy Perry.

09:08.600 --> 09:11.780
What are we doin' right now?
We're too old. It's just gross already.

09:11.880 --> 09:13.420
Plus, you're married to a woman
who hates you.

09:13.520 --> 09:16.126
She doesn't hate me.
She just doesn't get it, you know.

09:16.240 --> 09:19.660
We don't have the free time to do stuff
together like we did 10 years ago.

09:19.760 --> 09:21.300
This job is killing me, man.

09:21.400 --> 09:23.340
If I were you,

09:23.440 --> 09:27.340
maybe a half hour a day,
turn off the cell phone,

09:27.440 --> 09:29.900
shut down the emails,
put away the Reggie bars

09:30.000 --> 09:31.540
and focus on your wife.

09:31.640 --> 09:33.420
<i>The President's gaffe-filled summer
continued today...</i>

09:33.520 --> 09:34.860
Hold on a second. I gotta see this.

09:34.960 --> 09:38.620
<i>...at Joseph Knibb Elementary School
to promote his new youth reading initiative.</i>

09:38.720 --> 09:39.780
<i>Here's what happened.</i>

09:39.880 --> 09:44.260
<i>"Mittens jumped up onto the table
and knocked over the whole bowl of soup.</i>

09:44.360 --> 09:46.860
<i>"Mrs. Pickles gassed... Gasped."</i>

09:46.960 --> 09:47.961
<i>She gasped.</i>

09:48.520 --> 09:50.580
<i>"And the whole room fell silent.</i>

09:50.680 --> 09:52.300
<i>"This was casta...</i>

09:52.400 --> 09:53.561
<i>"This is cast...</i>

09:54.560 --> 09:56.050
<i>"Catatastrophic."</i>

09:56.160 --> 09:57.260
<i>Catastrophic.</i>

09:57.360 --> 09:58.850
<i>I got it, sweetheart, okay?</i>

10:00.240 --> 10:01.580
<i>Why'd you yell at me?</i>

10:01.680 --> 10:02.780
<i>You're mean.</i>

10:02.880 --> 10:04.086
<i>Leave her alone.</i>

10:04.800 --> 10:06.564
<i>The President can't read.</i>

10:13.000 --> 10:15.128
You gotta learn how to read, buddy.
It's as simple as that.

10:19.080 --> 10:21.242
I was on three hours' sleep, all right?

10:21.360 --> 10:24.020
- Your economics are hurting poor people!
- Nice to see ya!

10:24.120 --> 10:26.540
You've got the blood
of innocent children on your hands.

10:26.640 --> 10:27.620
Thank you for your support.

10:27.720 --> 10:29.700
I can't afford to go to college
because of you!

10:29.800 --> 10:30.780
That's a lovely dress.

10:30.880 --> 10:33.884
- You're ruining the country!
- Yeah, we're all in this together, now.

10:34.320 --> 10:35.460
You got a rough life, bud.

10:35.560 --> 10:36.971
- Sir?
- Thank you.

10:38.640 --> 10:39.780
But at least you have a life.

10:39.880 --> 10:42.220
Look, Brenner, you're meant
for something more than this.

10:42.320 --> 10:44.926
You just need to channel your genius
into something productive.

10:45.040 --> 10:47.300
I mean, you were incredible
at video games back in the day,

10:47.400 --> 10:49.140
but that's a useless skill now.

10:49.240 --> 10:50.844
It's like being a great blacksmith.

10:51.960 --> 10:55.140
That hurt, man. That's catatastrophic
that you said that.

10:55.240 --> 10:56.685
I'm gonna get you back for that.

10:56.800 --> 11:00.460
Mr. President,
if you take away all the libraries, sir,

11:00.560 --> 11:02.449
how will the children
ever learn to read?

11:05.880 --> 11:08.087
Blacksmith, over and out.

11:39.000 --> 11:41.860
Hello. I am a nerd
from the Nerd Brigade.

11:41.960 --> 11:45.089
Here to nerd out
on all your audio and visual needs.

11:45.320 --> 11:47.700
Do you have to say that
every time you show up at a house?

11:47.800 --> 11:49.540
If I wanna get paid, yes.

11:49.640 --> 11:51.100
Isn't that kind of demeaning?

11:51.200 --> 11:52.690
Only if someone brings it up.

11:53.080 --> 11:55.128
- Okay, I won't bring it up, then.
- Thanks.

11:55.480 --> 11:56.766
Come on in.

11:58.360 --> 12:00.740
So, what am I installing?

12:00.840 --> 12:03.860
A new 85-inch, 4K, 3D TV,

12:03.960 --> 12:07.089
PlayStation 4,
7.1 surround-sound speakers.

12:07.760 --> 12:10.604
Really, if you guys sell it,
we've probably bought it.

12:11.320 --> 12:12.420
Is it your birthday?

12:12.520 --> 12:13.965
No, my parents are getting a divorce.

12:14.840 --> 12:16.100
So it's like 10 birthdays.

12:16.200 --> 12:20.500
Yeah, my dad cheated on my mom
with his 19-year-old Pilates instructor.

12:20.600 --> 12:22.340
Her name's Sinnamon, with an "S"

12:22.440 --> 12:24.841
which really tells you
all you need to know about her.

12:25.320 --> 12:27.220
No, I could hear a little more.
You got any pictures?

12:27.320 --> 12:28.740
I'm kiddin'. I'm sorry to hear that.

12:28.840 --> 12:30.500
My mom kind of hates him right now.

12:30.600 --> 12:34.220
And she says she's gonna invent
a slut-seeking missile to take out Sinnamon.

12:34.320 --> 12:38.370
Okay, Matty, you don't need to tell
the nice installer man our whole life.

12:40.120 --> 12:41.121
Whoa.

12:41.440 --> 12:43.044
I'm sorry, "Whoa"?

12:43.160 --> 12:45.580
- What?
- No, just you. Whoa.

12:45.680 --> 12:49.220
Me? Whoa?
I don't even know what that means.

12:49.320 --> 12:54.645
I mean, it's just, when your son told me
that your husband left you for a 19-year-old,

12:55.360 --> 12:58.380
I guess I thought
you were gonna be, like

12:58.480 --> 13:00.860
one of those
"hot when we first met in high school,

13:00.960 --> 13:05.010
"but then let herself go
and got a potbelly and turkey neck

13:06.120 --> 13:07.451
"with a hairy chin."

13:07.840 --> 13:10.660
But clearly that's not the case.

13:10.760 --> 13:12.100
So more like,

13:12.200 --> 13:15.660
"Whoa, I should have brushed my teeth
before I left the house this morning."

13:15.760 --> 13:18.060
Or studio apartment,
if we're getting real here.

13:18.160 --> 13:20.401
Did you really
not brush your teeth this morning?

13:21.080 --> 13:22.206
No, I did.

13:22.880 --> 13:26.487
I guess I should just start
settin' this stuff up right now.

13:26.920 --> 13:28.331
Go get 'em.

13:43.680 --> 13:45.300
Colonel Devereux.

13:45.400 --> 13:47.084
You need to see this, sir.

13:51.880 --> 13:53.291
We're under attack.

14:03.120 --> 14:04.804
What the hell are those things?

14:05.760 --> 14:07.364
So are you a gamer?

14:09.320 --> 14:10.380
Yeah.

14:10.480 --> 14:12.528
I played when I was your age.

14:12.960 --> 14:14.460
Were you any good?

14:14.560 --> 14:17.940
I was pretty good
at some of the classic games.

14:18.040 --> 14:20.420
Classics.
You mean like <i>Halo</i> and <i>Call of Duty.</i>

14:20.520 --> 14:22.727
No! The real classics.

14:22.840 --> 14:25.900
<i>Defender, Pac-Man, Asteroids.</i>

14:26.000 --> 14:27.860
Games you played in an arcade

14:27.960 --> 14:30.380
which was a building
outside of your house.

14:30.480 --> 14:34.340
You would go there with your friends,
listen to music, cute girls everywhere.

14:34.440 --> 14:37.091
In ancient times,
they called it "socializing."

14:38.040 --> 14:39.326
What are you guys talking about?

14:39.800 --> 14:41.211
- Video games.
- Video games.

14:47.640 --> 14:48.687
I'll be right back.

14:52.600 --> 14:54.060
Mrs. Van Patten.

14:54.160 --> 14:55.740
All finished up down there.

14:55.840 --> 14:57.820
I need you to sign the work order.

14:57.920 --> 14:58.967
Okay.

15:01.120 --> 15:03.620
Mrs. Van Patten, are you in the closet?

15:03.720 --> 15:04.881
Yes.

15:06.480 --> 15:09.404
Not judging,
but what are you doin' in the closet?

15:10.240 --> 15:11.810
I'm mostly crying.

15:12.800 --> 15:14.450
A little drinking.

15:15.320 --> 15:17.700
Probably equally crying and drinking.

15:17.800 --> 15:20.580
Something I do often, also.

15:20.680 --> 15:22.523
But why in the closet?

15:23.880 --> 15:26.531
Because I don't want Matty to see me.

15:30.000 --> 15:32.844
I'm comin' in the closet,
Mrs. Van Patten.

15:33.400 --> 15:35.209
I'm opening the door.

15:39.040 --> 15:40.690
Are you all right?

15:41.440 --> 15:45.180
I'm sobbing on the floor of my closet
drinking Chardonnay out of a sippy cup.

15:45.280 --> 15:46.820
So I guess not.

15:46.920 --> 15:49.207
Sorry. I withdraw the question.

15:54.000 --> 15:56.002
God.

15:57.840 --> 16:00.081
- Wanna talk about it?
- No.

16:01.200 --> 16:02.281
Yes!

16:03.360 --> 16:04.771
Yes.

16:07.680 --> 16:09.364
God.

16:10.880 --> 16:15.540
Sir, we are in the midst of an aerial attack
by an unidentified force!

16:15.640 --> 16:17.642
Activate the QRF.

17:08.000 --> 17:09.968
Mama! No!

17:15.880 --> 17:19.060
We were high-school sweethearts.
The perfect couple.

17:19.160 --> 17:22.060
Do you know that he proposed
in a waterfall?

17:22.160 --> 17:24.619
- I mean, a freaking waterfall.
- Smooth.

17:24.720 --> 17:27.140
But now, according to a text
I got 20 minutes ago,

17:27.240 --> 17:30.164
he's marrying
a 19-year-old named after a spice.

17:31.040 --> 17:32.963
It's not even spelled correctly.

17:36.240 --> 17:39.300
It's just not where I thought I'd be
at this point in my life.

17:39.400 --> 17:40.765
God. I hear that.

17:41.800 --> 17:45.180
I was supposed to have a baby
with my ex-wife.

17:45.280 --> 17:47.740
And the doctor
who was helping us make the baby

17:47.840 --> 17:49.420
did help us make the baby.

17:49.520 --> 17:51.522
But, unfortunately,
I wasn't in the room.

18:01.920 --> 18:04.571
Maybe this really is all for the best.

18:05.120 --> 18:06.500
How do you mean?

18:06.600 --> 18:09.888
You already married the wrong guy.
You got the worst part over with.

18:10.320 --> 18:12.926
True, and you married the wrong girl.

18:15.760 --> 18:18.843
Maybe it just means
we're gonna meet the right person now.

18:23.160 --> 18:24.161
Yeah.

18:24.920 --> 18:26.046
Yeah.

18:35.440 --> 18:37.220
Are you trying to kiss me?

18:37.320 --> 18:38.500
Absolutely not.

18:38.600 --> 18:39.886
God.

18:40.760 --> 18:42.620
Sorry, I thought
we were having a moment.

18:42.720 --> 18:44.688
We were. A moment.

18:46.160 --> 18:49.700
Look, you seem like a very nice guy,
but I just met you, okay?

18:49.800 --> 18:51.180
And, no offense,

18:51.280 --> 18:54.900
I don't think my rebound guy
is a 210-pound person

18:55.000 --> 18:57.810
that installs flat screens for a living.

18:58.280 --> 19:00.380
First of all, 208.

19:00.480 --> 19:03.860
And, wow,
I didn't peg you as the snobby type.

19:03.960 --> 19:05.700
Snob? Me?

19:05.800 --> 19:07.180
Okay.

19:07.280 --> 19:08.660
I am not a snob.

19:08.760 --> 19:13.766
Okay, well, let's just say I was a billionaire,
and we were out on my giant yacht

19:13.880 --> 19:16.460
in the middle of the Mediterranean,
sipping champagne,

19:16.560 --> 19:17.820
and I went in to kiss you.

19:17.920 --> 19:19.160
Would you have kissed me back, then?

19:21.960 --> 19:24.008
Hold that thought, snobby.

19:25.560 --> 19:26.860
Big Man!

19:26.960 --> 19:28.740
<i>Can you get
to the White House right now?</i>

19:28.840 --> 19:30.524
I'll be there in 15.

19:31.600 --> 19:32.860
While I'd love to stick around

19:32.960 --> 19:36.100
and listen to you lie about not wanting to
make out with the yacht guy,

19:36.200 --> 19:37.201
I have to go.

19:38.200 --> 19:40.540
For the record, I'm an amazing kisser.

19:40.640 --> 19:41.860
All us nerds are.

19:41.960 --> 19:44.008
'Cause we appreciate it more.

19:44.800 --> 19:47.620
You didn't even brush your teeth
this morning.

19:47.720 --> 19:49.324
I ate a Tic Tac.

20:06.520 --> 20:09.410
Too late, sweetheart.
You had your shot and ya blew it.

20:09.520 --> 20:10.980
I'm not following you.

20:11.080 --> 20:14.482
Yeah, whatever you say, stalky.
It's over. Deal with it.

20:24.440 --> 20:27.540
Whoa, she went from zero
to psycho in 3.4 seconds,

20:27.640 --> 20:28.801
a new world record.

20:44.320 --> 20:45.460
Hey, Steve-O.

20:45.560 --> 20:48.820
There's a crazy woman following me.
I guarantee she's here to shoot the President.

20:48.920 --> 20:50.980
And if I were you,
I'd break out the billy club

20:51.080 --> 20:52.923
and go full throttle on her, seriously.

21:00.920 --> 21:02.729
Go right on through, Lieutenant Colonel.

21:10.920 --> 21:13.180
- Why are you following me?
- God.

21:13.280 --> 21:16.700
God. I can't believe
they even let you in here.

21:16.800 --> 21:17.881
Right.

21:18.760 --> 21:21.980
Colonel Van Patten, you can go
right into the Situation Room.

21:22.080 --> 21:26.420
See, they need me in the Situation Room,
so have fun doing whatever you're doing.

21:26.520 --> 21:29.649
Mr. Brenner, the President is waiting
for you in the Oval Office.

21:31.160 --> 21:34.004
Somebody's more important.

21:38.760 --> 21:41.889
Freddy, can you keep
the riffraff outta here?

21:47.280 --> 21:48.780
Yo, wassup?

21:48.880 --> 21:51.100
Come on,
you couldn't have at least changed?

21:51.200 --> 21:53.060
You told me to rush right over.

21:53.160 --> 21:56.060
What's going on, man?
Why's it so crazy out there?

21:56.160 --> 21:58.220
Our Air Force base in Guam was attacked.

21:58.320 --> 21:59.500
By who?

21:59.600 --> 22:01.140
I'm not sure. That's what
I wanted to ask you.

22:01.240 --> 22:03.380
Come here. Check this out.

22:03.480 --> 22:06.165
- Me?
- Yes, you. Come here.

22:07.680 --> 22:09.250
Listen to this.

22:10.200 --> 22:12.180
Does that sound familiar to you?

22:12.280 --> 22:14.647
Yeah. Where do I know that from?

22:15.280 --> 22:17.203
- Can you freeze it?
- Yeah, hold on.

22:18.080 --> 22:19.605
Go in tighter.

22:22.720 --> 22:25.883
- That can't be real.
- So you're seeing the same thing I'm seeing.

22:26.760 --> 22:30.048
What kind of mushrooms
did that guy put on our burgers?

22:31.320 --> 22:33.402
- They're ready for you, Mr. President.
- Great.

22:33.840 --> 22:35.620
Now I gotta explain this
to the National Security Council.

22:35.720 --> 22:36.980
Listen, do me a favor, Sam.

22:37.080 --> 22:38.220
Watch that again, okay?

22:38.320 --> 22:41.060
And just see if there's anything
you can find to help us out.

22:41.160 --> 22:42.900
Yeah. Can I sit in your chair?

22:43.000 --> 22:44.620
No, you can't,
and everything's recorded.

22:44.720 --> 22:47.326
Okay, I won't. I won't. I won't.

22:48.280 --> 22:50.681
I'm sittin' in the chair. Gimme a break.

22:54.000 --> 22:58.500
Mr. President, we told the press that it was
an advanced weapons test that misfired.

22:58.600 --> 23:00.820
- So there's no mass panic yet.
- Well, good.

23:00.920 --> 23:02.940
Then let's solve this thing
before there is.

23:03.040 --> 23:05.700
Mr. President, someone's made
a major breakthrough in drone technology

23:05.800 --> 23:06.820
and it wasn't us.

23:06.920 --> 23:08.380
This has got Moscow's fingerprints
all over it.

23:08.480 --> 23:11.140
Nonsense!
It's an Iranian black-ops sideshow.

23:11.240 --> 23:12.241
I guarantee it.

23:12.640 --> 23:13.700
I have a theory.

23:13.800 --> 23:16.300
I think, based on analysis
of the footage,

23:16.400 --> 23:20.325
that preliminary indications
are that we were attacked by

23:21.440 --> 23:22.441
Galaga.

23:23.640 --> 23:24.846
By who, sir?

23:25.400 --> 23:26.731
Galaga.

23:26.840 --> 23:28.410
Sons of bitches.

23:28.960 --> 23:31.247
Then let's blow Galaga to hell.

23:31.520 --> 23:32.521
Who's Galaga?

23:33.120 --> 23:37.020
It's an old-timey video game,
'80s kind of folks like my dad used to play.

23:37.120 --> 23:40.900
Mr. President, there is no nation on Earth
that has the military technology

23:41.000 --> 23:43.820
to simply pixelate entire buildings.

23:43.920 --> 23:44.921
Except Iran.

23:45.240 --> 23:46.340
Forget Iran!

23:46.440 --> 23:48.860
I'm thinking this is a cutting-edge
multinational enterprise.

23:48.960 --> 23:51.380
An NGO, a think tank,
maybe even a corporation.

23:51.480 --> 23:53.847
We're thinkin' Iran
when we should be thinking Google.

23:54.560 --> 23:55.971
So let's blow up Google.

23:56.680 --> 24:00.366
Can somebody take Grandpa's keys away
before he drives us into a ditch?

24:03.920 --> 24:05.843
- Who is this person?
- The sandwich guy?

24:06.440 --> 24:10.684
This here is my old
arcade game technical

24:10.800 --> 24:13.167
advisor person-guy.

24:13.880 --> 24:15.980
Sam Brenner.
He works in the tech sector.

24:16.080 --> 24:17.820
So Caltech, MIT?

24:17.920 --> 24:19.260
MIT. Yes.

24:19.360 --> 24:21.580
Mississippi Institute
of Technology, though.

24:21.680 --> 24:22.780
Not the one you were thinking of.

24:22.880 --> 24:24.380
Anyway, more to the current point,

24:24.480 --> 24:27.060
Mr. Brenner here
was the World Galaga Champion.

24:27.160 --> 24:29.540
He knows everything
there is to know about this game.

24:29.640 --> 24:32.620
So, what is it you and your orange shorts
barged in here to say?

24:32.720 --> 24:35.580
Just the Galaga that attacked us,

24:35.680 --> 24:37.580
that doesn't exist anymore.

24:37.680 --> 24:41.571
Hello. You can download <i>Galaga</i>
on your phone for $1.99.

24:41.840 --> 24:44.300
Yeah, not this version though,
Blue Lagoon.

24:44.400 --> 24:48.100
The <i>Galaga</i> that exists
now came out in 1986.

24:48.200 --> 24:50.726
But this is the 1982 arcade version.

24:50.840 --> 24:53.460
And all those machines, they recalled them,
they reprogrammed them,

24:53.560 --> 24:55.340
because there were glitches
in the original code.

24:55.440 --> 24:58.700
You can see from the giant space bugs,
the way they come swoopin' in.

24:58.800 --> 25:00.060
Kind of ziggy-zaggy.

25:00.160 --> 25:01.400
Ziggy-zag? Is that the snobby term?

25:02.000 --> 25:04.140
So someone designed these space bugs

25:04.240 --> 25:07.780
after an old out-of-print version
of a video game from 30 years ago

25:07.880 --> 25:09.140
that nobody would know today?

25:09.240 --> 25:12.050
Does she really get to talk twice?
She's not even at the grown-ups table.

25:12.360 --> 25:15.500
I'm sorry.
Is this a National Security Council meeting,

25:15.600 --> 25:16.965
or a dorm-room drug party?

25:17.640 --> 25:21.180
Our nation has just been attacked
by an unknown military force.

25:21.280 --> 25:23.660
If this gets out to the press
that we're pinning the blame

25:23.760 --> 25:25.220
on some old computer game,

25:25.320 --> 25:29.211
they'll not only mock you in the news,
Mr. President, they'd impeach you!

25:30.760 --> 25:34.890
So I suggest the man in the orange shorts
leave the room immediately.

25:35.160 --> 25:38.740
And those of us with long pants
and government positions

25:38.840 --> 25:41.650
can discuss our options.

25:43.920 --> 25:47.561
All right, Brenner. Do me a favor.
Take off, all right? I appreciate the help.

25:47.880 --> 25:48.881
Bye!

25:50.480 --> 25:52.767
Sorry, everybody.

25:53.760 --> 25:55.285
Mr. President.

25:56.480 --> 25:58.940
Generals and Admirals.

25:59.040 --> 26:00.326
Guys in suits.

26:01.280 --> 26:02.406
Zac Efron.

26:03.640 --> 26:04.660
Gandalf,

26:04.760 --> 26:06.842
and Harry Potter in the same room.

26:06.960 --> 26:08.121
Imagine that.

26:08.520 --> 26:11.683
Grandpa,
we'll see you around the nursing home.

26:13.600 --> 26:14.806
The sandwich guy is here.

26:16.000 --> 26:17.001
Fooled you.

26:19.760 --> 26:22.843
<i>Past the shortstop into left
center field for a single.</i>

26:23.240 --> 26:26.900
<i>That's the second straight inning
where Washington has led off with a single.</i>

26:27.000 --> 26:30.060
<i>They're talking about how
he's standing straight up over the plate.</i>

26:30.160 --> 26:31.241
<i>That seems to be working out for him,</i>

26:31.360 --> 26:34.060
<i>'cause he just drove
that ball into the gap hard.</i>

26:34.160 --> 26:36.740
<i>First pitch taken outside
for a ball, 1-0,</i>

26:36.840 --> 26:38.020
<i>and the 1-0 swung...</i>

26:38.120 --> 26:39.121
Brenner!

26:44.760 --> 26:46.580
What's your problem, dude?

26:46.680 --> 26:48.125
What's goin' on?

26:49.400 --> 26:50.420
No, Brenner!

26:50.520 --> 26:52.140
No, Brenner, no, no, no!

26:52.240 --> 26:55.005
Stop! It's me! It's me! It's Ludlow!
It's Ludlow.

26:55.680 --> 26:59.140
- Ludlow Lamonsoff, the Wonder Kid?
- Yeah.

26:59.240 --> 27:00.287
How'd you get into my van?

27:00.600 --> 27:03.100
I've been in there ever since
you went to that nice lady's house.

27:03.200 --> 27:04.260
She's cute, by the way.

27:04.360 --> 27:05.361
What?

27:06.840 --> 27:09.844
- What is that?
- This is moisturizer.

27:10.280 --> 27:11.645
Show me what that is.

27:13.040 --> 27:14.166
Chloroform?

27:14.440 --> 27:15.620
Is that what that says?

27:15.720 --> 27:17.100
You were gonna drug me?

27:17.200 --> 27:19.220
- Only as a last resort.
- What are you...

27:19.320 --> 27:22.051
- There was something I had to tell you.
- Why didn't you call me, then?

27:22.720 --> 27:24.860
Because the CIA
has been tapping my phones

27:24.960 --> 27:27.740
ever since I found out
the Zapruder film has been edited.

27:27.840 --> 27:29.604
JFK shot first!

27:31.360 --> 27:32.407
Ludlow, it is you!

27:33.320 --> 27:36.900
- Hi, buddy! Let me look at you!
- Hey! Good to see you, my boy!

27:37.000 --> 27:39.980
How are you? My goodness! Look at you!

27:40.080 --> 27:42.060
- I know.
- Stayin' in shape!

27:42.160 --> 27:44.260
I'm on an all protein diet,
but I'm also doing carbs.

27:44.360 --> 27:46.010
- Good.
- But seriously, Brenner.

27:46.720 --> 27:48.900
There's something I have to show you.

27:49.000 --> 27:51.020
And let's just say

27:51.120 --> 27:52.724
it's a game changer.

27:56.120 --> 27:58.980
You're the first guest I've had here.
Voluntarily.

27:59.080 --> 28:00.286
That's a shocker.

28:06.360 --> 28:08.169
If Lady Lisa was real,

28:08.280 --> 28:11.380
she'd have about
17 restraining orders out on you.

28:11.480 --> 28:12.660
Actually, I think if she was real,

28:12.760 --> 28:14.524
things might just play out
a little bit differently.

28:14.800 --> 28:16.500
You wanna know how I know that?

28:16.600 --> 28:17.580
<i>If She Was Real.</i>

28:17.680 --> 28:19.682
A book written and illustrated
by Ludlow Lamonsoff.

28:19.800 --> 28:20.847
Boy.

28:27.320 --> 28:29.700
You should sell
that at Barnes & Unstable.

28:29.800 --> 28:31.220
- Do you want a copy?
- No.

28:31.320 --> 28:32.401
I have eight others.

28:32.520 --> 28:35.020
Why am I here right now?
Why did you try to roofie me?

28:35.120 --> 28:39.125
Right. Thank you for reminding me. Okay.
Follow me.

28:40.160 --> 28:43.642
Earlier today, our military base in Guam
was attacked by this guy, Galaga.

28:44.240 --> 28:45.220
How would you know that?

28:45.320 --> 28:47.700
I have a pen pal in Guam.
His name is Baubau.

28:47.800 --> 28:48.900
Baubau was terribly frightened,

28:49.000 --> 28:52.300
so I hacked into the government's servers
to assure Baubau that everything was okay.

28:52.400 --> 28:54.641
But you know what?
Everything was not okay.

28:55.040 --> 28:59.540
Ludlow! Did you get me some diet
root beer while you were out?

28:59.640 --> 29:01.780
- You remember my grandma.
- Sure.

29:01.880 --> 29:04.690
She's still a character
after all those years.

29:05.160 --> 29:09.100
No, no, Grandma! It's funny.
I didn't get a chance to because...

29:09.200 --> 29:10.860
What happened? I remember now.

29:10.960 --> 29:14.900
I'm trying to save the world
from annihilation!

29:15.000 --> 29:16.331
Are you nuts?

29:16.440 --> 29:17.980
You cracker!

29:18.080 --> 29:19.809
Don't yell at me!

29:20.680 --> 29:24.300
So look, I know that sometimes people
think of me as a bit of a conspiracy nut.

29:24.400 --> 29:25.401
Right.

29:25.800 --> 29:28.100
But sometimes, Brenner, sometimes

29:28.200 --> 29:30.202
the conspiracies are real.

29:30.720 --> 29:32.740
Have you been playing <i>Space Invaders</i>
a lot lately?

29:32.840 --> 29:33.921
I have. How did you know that?

29:34.040 --> 29:35.849
'Cause you're invading my space.
Back up.

29:37.000 --> 29:38.340
Brenner, do you remember
when we were children,

29:38.440 --> 29:40.820
and we played
in that video game championship?

29:40.920 --> 29:42.729
Of course, buddy.

29:42.840 --> 29:44.700
Do you remember how
there was a tape of the event

29:44.800 --> 29:46.980
and all the games that were played
that was then put in a capsule

29:47.080 --> 29:48.700
and shot out into the universe

29:48.800 --> 29:50.450
looking for extraterrestrial life?

29:51.240 --> 29:55.404
I have reason to believe that some
alien life force found that tape

29:55.520 --> 30:00.020
and has sent down real-life versions
of what they saw

30:00.120 --> 30:01.360
to attack us.

30:01.680 --> 30:02.980
Brenner, I spent the day on 4chan

30:03.080 --> 30:05.900
searching for messages
from the aliens to prove my theory.

30:06.000 --> 30:07.889
- And you wanna know something?
- Tell me.

30:08.200 --> 30:09.565
I came up absolutely empty.

30:09.840 --> 30:12.060
So then, as a distraction, I got up

30:12.160 --> 30:15.660
to try to watch an episode of <i>One Tree Hill</i>
that I recorded on my VCR last night.

30:15.760 --> 30:17.220
I've been binge-watching to catch up.

30:17.320 --> 30:19.140
And you don't have cable because...

30:19.240 --> 30:22.100
Because the government spies on us
through our cable boxes, Brenner.

30:22.200 --> 30:23.340
That's been proven.

30:23.440 --> 30:25.140
And you don't want them to see you
dancin' around

30:25.240 --> 30:26.860
in your underwear for Lady Lisa.
I get it.

30:26.960 --> 30:29.486
No, that tape was burned
three months ago. Anyway...

30:31.320 --> 30:33.140
In the middle of the UHF broadcast,

30:33.240 --> 30:37.500
something peculiar interrupted
Sophia Bush's sexy shenanigans.

30:37.600 --> 30:39.250
<i>No, you're the freak with the fat...</i>

30:44.680 --> 30:46.409
<i>Inhabitants of Earth,</i>

30:46.920 --> 30:49.366
<i>we are a race from the planet Volula.</i>

30:49.520 --> 30:52.260
<i>We came to you
in these familiar Earth forms</i>

30:52.360 --> 30:54.408
<i>to tell we received your vessel.</i>

30:54.720 --> 30:56.780
<i>And in it, your hostile challenge.</i>

30:56.880 --> 31:01.860
<i>We accept your offer to compete
in winner-take-all battles.</i>

31:01.960 --> 31:06.682
<i>Gather your bravest warriors
to face our bravest warriors!</i>

31:06.880 --> 31:08.700
<i>The winner takes the loser's planet.</i>

31:08.800 --> 31:10.609
<i>You have already lost the first battle.</i>

31:10.720 --> 31:13.121
<i>And for our victory,
we have taken a trophy.</i>

31:14.400 --> 31:16.050
<i>I'm okay, Mama.</i>

31:16.760 --> 31:18.171
<i>I love you.</i>

31:19.200 --> 31:20.804
<i>That's not the real Madonna!</i>

31:21.800 --> 31:23.660
<i>You will get three lives.</i>

31:23.760 --> 31:25.100
<i>You have two lives left.</i>

31:25.200 --> 31:29.260
<i>Losing both will lead
to the total destruction of your planet.</i>

31:29.360 --> 31:31.660
<i>The next battle is in 15 hours</i>

31:31.760 --> 31:35.287
<i>at coordinates 27° 24' 79".</i>

31:37.200 --> 31:38.700
Okay, I got lost about halfway through.

31:38.800 --> 31:40.780
Why does Madonna
wanna take over our planet?

31:40.880 --> 31:44.726
These moron aliens think that
the footage NASA sent up to space

31:44.840 --> 31:46.540
of us playing video games in 1982

31:46.640 --> 31:48.300
was a declaration of war.

31:48.400 --> 31:53.300
Intergalactic war, Mr. President.
Isn't that crazy? Isn't that unpredictable?

31:53.400 --> 31:54.740
Lud, listen.

31:54.840 --> 31:56.900
You helped unscramble my Cinemax
when we were kids.

31:57.000 --> 31:58.365
I think you can call me Chewie.

31:58.880 --> 32:00.962
What do they mean by three lives?
What is that?

32:01.840 --> 32:03.820
If I may. See, that's just it.

32:03.920 --> 32:07.860
It's like the video games of old,
Chewie Mr. President.

32:07.960 --> 32:10.611
One quarter, three lives.

32:11.000 --> 32:13.740
This is clearly not a quarter.
This is far more valuable. May I keep this?

32:13.840 --> 32:15.500
- Put it back on the desk.
- Fair enough.

32:15.600 --> 32:17.602
We lost the first one, <i>Galaga.</i>

32:17.960 --> 32:19.420
Two more losses and...

32:19.520 --> 32:20.740
It's game over.

32:20.840 --> 32:22.380
Now, assuming that...

32:22.480 --> 32:24.540
- You know what, that's not happening.
- Fair enough.

32:24.640 --> 32:28.260
Assuming that Alien Madonna's numbers
are actually latitude and longitude,

32:28.360 --> 32:31.603
then we can safely assume that
the next attack should happen somewhere

32:31.720 --> 32:33.100
in Northern India tonight.

32:33.200 --> 32:35.940
If you can get your guys from the NSA
to clean up the signal,

32:36.040 --> 32:38.940
then we can pinpoint
exactly where the attack is gonna be,

32:39.040 --> 32:42.100
and maybe even which game
they're gonna use to attack us.

32:42.200 --> 32:44.460
I can't authorize a military response

32:44.560 --> 32:48.460
based off a video that looks like
it was made by a couple high school kids.

32:48.560 --> 32:51.620
You gotta at least warn the people
of India somethin' could be comin'.

32:51.720 --> 32:54.540
The whole country thinks
I'm a buffoon right now as it is.

32:54.640 --> 32:57.291
Look, I can't risk it, Brenner.
I just can't!

32:58.640 --> 33:01.700
So I guess we've been dating for almost
three years now.

33:01.800 --> 33:03.460
Yes, almost three.

33:03.560 --> 33:06.370
They have been
the best years of my life.

33:07.080 --> 33:09.686
...and I think
we have something very special.

33:09.800 --> 33:13.771
Raj, is this what I think it is?

33:27.120 --> 33:28.884
Will you marry me?

34:09.719 --> 34:11.580
Don't sweat the whole Taj Mahal thing.

34:11.679 --> 34:14.540
It's probably better that there's only
an even six Wonders of the World now.

34:14.639 --> 34:16.219
You know what? I get it. I screwed up.

34:16.320 --> 34:17.940
It won't happen again. Shut up.

34:18.040 --> 34:19.530
Good morning, Mr. President.

34:20.560 --> 34:23.484
What's Radio Shack Robbie doing here?
And this other

34:23.760 --> 34:24.699
fella.

34:24.800 --> 34:26.940
Hi. Ludlow Lamonsoff.

34:27.040 --> 34:28.900
We've actually met before,
but you wouldn't remember

34:29.000 --> 34:32.049
because it was in the back of Brenner's van
and I was watching you through a window.

34:32.880 --> 34:35.690
You smell so nice,
like the Book of Genesis.

34:35.800 --> 34:38.060
Mr. Lamonsoff and Mr. Brenner

34:38.159 --> 34:41.139
have agreed to share their video game
expertise with you and your team.

34:41.239 --> 34:42.219
Happy to do it.

34:42.320 --> 34:43.380
With all due respect, sir,

34:43.480 --> 34:46.659
having civilians with zero security
clearance in this facility is...

34:46.760 --> 34:49.900
These civilians have
better insight into our current crisis

34:50.000 --> 34:51.570
than my entire administration.

34:51.679 --> 34:54.100
I dunno if I wanna do it now.
She's being so mean.

34:54.199 --> 34:55.300
- I kind of wanna leave.
- Okay.

34:55.400 --> 34:57.129
- If he leaves, I leave. We're a team.
- Stop it.

34:57.240 --> 34:59.900
- This is how it's gonna be the whole time?
- Guys, knock it off. Lead the way.

35:00.000 --> 35:01.206
Of course, Mr. President.

35:04.240 --> 35:06.780
So have we made any progress, Colonel?

35:06.880 --> 35:08.620
Enormous progress, sir.

35:08.720 --> 35:11.620
We now understand the entities
that attacked us were made of energy.

35:11.720 --> 35:12.960
Intelligent energy.

35:13.520 --> 35:16.046
- Morning, Colonel.
- Good morning, Michael.

35:17.800 --> 35:20.060
Michael's a robot!

35:20.160 --> 35:23.420
I think maybe the extraterrestrials
took what they saw in the orbiter

35:23.520 --> 35:26.410
and recreated the same things
using light energy.

35:26.520 --> 35:29.364
And then sent these light creatures
back at us.

35:29.480 --> 35:34.100
That's why solid matter, bullets
and missiles, won't harm them.

35:34.200 --> 35:35.340
Can anything harm them?

35:35.440 --> 35:36.680
Maybe.

35:37.320 --> 35:41.180
The cubes we recovered in Guam
are normally pretty feisty.

35:41.280 --> 35:42.725
Hey, look at that!

35:43.280 --> 35:44.725
He didn't like it though.

35:47.400 --> 35:49.100
But they calm down pretty quick

35:49.200 --> 35:51.931
when we hit them with
some super-charged light particles.

35:53.640 --> 35:55.980
And the slut-seeking missile,
I'd love to see that.

35:56.080 --> 35:58.260
- Do you have that around here?
- You are so smart.

35:58.360 --> 35:59.780
Yeah? You think so?

35:59.880 --> 36:02.460
Is that how you got into
the Mississippi Institute of Technology?

36:02.560 --> 36:04.820
You know, I wish I never went
in that closet with you.

36:04.920 --> 36:07.660
I was very happy
drinking and crying by myself.

36:07.760 --> 36:09.140
I so regret trying to kiss you.

36:09.240 --> 36:12.323
I would kiss the guy in the yacht
100 times before I kissed you.

36:20.320 --> 36:21.845
- Moving on.
- Yeah.

36:23.600 --> 36:26.180
We have begun instructing
the Navy SEAL task force

36:26.280 --> 36:27.964
on the use of the prototype weapons.

36:28.640 --> 36:30.180
- What do we train for?
- War!

36:30.280 --> 36:31.850
- Why do we fight?
- To win!

36:31.960 --> 36:33.500
- When do we quit?
- Never!

36:33.600 --> 36:35.340
- What do we train for?
- War!

36:35.440 --> 36:37.060
- Why do we fight?
- To win!

36:37.160 --> 36:39.340
- When do we quit?
- Never!

36:39.440 --> 36:44.162
Perhaps our new expert advisors
would like to say a few words to the SEALs.

36:44.840 --> 36:45.921
Boy.

36:47.320 --> 36:49.860
Men, you have served this nation
with distinction,

36:49.960 --> 36:55.000
in combat zones, in every nook
and cranny of this godforsaken world,

36:55.280 --> 36:58.329
defeating every enemy
they've thrown at you.

36:58.640 --> 36:59.721
Hey, what's up?

37:00.320 --> 37:01.260
Brenner?

37:01.360 --> 37:03.169
I couldn't get a babysitter.

37:03.880 --> 37:09.580
The President has brought in
these two civilian Arcaders

37:09.680 --> 37:11.762
who we are required to listen to

37:12.240 --> 37:15.005
for 120 seconds,

37:15.360 --> 37:16.340
starting...

37:16.440 --> 37:18.647
- I can't do this.
- You can do this.

37:18.840 --> 37:19.820
...now!

37:19.920 --> 37:21.540
I can't do this. I'm gonna throw up!

37:21.640 --> 37:24.220
We know how to do this. They don't.
Just act the part.

37:24.320 --> 37:25.560
Hey, guys.

37:25.680 --> 37:29.140
How are you? Hey, thank you,
General Zod, for that beautiful intro.

37:29.240 --> 37:32.323
Hey, fellas. Good to see you.

37:33.240 --> 37:36.460
Let me introduce myself.
My name is Sam Brenner.

37:36.560 --> 37:40.246
And this is the Wonder Kid,
also known as...

37:40.360 --> 37:42.522
Your worst nightmare!

37:46.200 --> 37:47.900
Looks to me, Brenner,

37:48.000 --> 37:50.924
like someone forgot to send us
the best of the best.

37:51.880 --> 37:55.740
And instead,
dropped off a bunch of incontinent,

37:55.840 --> 37:57.940
adult diaper-wearing,

37:58.040 --> 38:01.180
candy-assed, cries-himself-to-sleep,

38:01.280 --> 38:03.760
women-baby-man-people!

38:04.200 --> 38:05.770
What am I lookin' at right now?

38:06.040 --> 38:09.620
Are you guys soldiers?
Or the cast of <i>Magic Mike?</i>

38:09.720 --> 38:12.451
You gonna fight? Or dance naked?

38:14.600 --> 38:16.260
From now on,

38:16.360 --> 38:19.140
you maggots, you little girl maggots...

38:19.240 --> 38:21.780
Whatever the hell
the female form of maggot is.

38:21.880 --> 38:22.940
Magina?

38:23.040 --> 38:24.540
You magina!

38:24.640 --> 38:27.620
When you magina poop your pants,

38:27.720 --> 38:29.700
you're gonna be thinking of me!

38:29.800 --> 38:30.940
In your pants!

38:31.040 --> 38:32.565
You know what I mean.

38:34.480 --> 38:36.084
Do you feel me?

38:37.080 --> 38:39.048
Do you feel me, sailor?

38:39.800 --> 38:41.900
You beautiful Nubian man!

38:42.000 --> 38:44.924
You gorgeous specimen
of what God can make!

38:46.440 --> 38:47.740
Do you feel me?

38:47.840 --> 38:49.410
I think you're about to feel him, Lud.

38:50.240 --> 38:51.401
I can't move.

38:52.080 --> 38:53.980
Lemme help you. Hey, come here.

38:54.080 --> 38:56.140
Sorry. Don't touch the guy.
Just sit down.

38:56.240 --> 38:57.460
- Did I do good?
- You did awful.

38:57.560 --> 38:58.641
Sit down.

38:59.800 --> 39:01.325
Sorry about that, everybody.

39:01.760 --> 39:03.250
I know it's weird.

39:03.360 --> 39:06.660
Two buffoons like me and this guy
giving advice to you badasses.

39:06.760 --> 39:10.048
But the truth is we've been training.

39:10.160 --> 39:13.820
Since childhood, we've been training
our prefrontal cortex

39:13.920 --> 39:17.100
to perform extremely complex motor feats

39:17.200 --> 39:22.380
with hand-eye coordination
unique to a very specific cognitive acuity.

39:22.480 --> 39:25.290
I learned a lot of big words
at the dorm-room drug parties.

39:25.880 --> 39:29.168
All of it's been meaningless
in all areas of our life.

39:30.440 --> 39:35.287
But suddenly, it might be comin'
in handy to saving our planet.

39:35.800 --> 39:39.460
So we're hopin' you guys can forget
about us bein' civilian morons,

39:39.560 --> 39:43.121
and let us teach you a few things
in the little time we have.

39:43.680 --> 39:46.490
I think we might help you
win this thing.

39:47.200 --> 39:50.940
There is only one objective in <i>Asteroids.</i>

39:51.040 --> 39:55.380
That is to destroy every rock
and every saucer.

39:55.480 --> 39:58.420
You don't wanna get hit
by any of these boulders.

39:58.520 --> 40:01.380
That's why I recommend
stayin' in the middle.

40:01.480 --> 40:03.900
Just 'cause you see a hammer
doesn't mean grab it.

40:04.000 --> 40:05.980
You're not gonna climb a ladder
with a hammer in your hand.

40:06.080 --> 40:07.889
- Very good.
- Good piloting, Maverick!

40:09.680 --> 40:10.940
Don't lock into radar.

40:11.040 --> 40:12.980
Okay, it's fine, son. It's fine.

40:13.080 --> 40:15.162
You just blew up our entire planet.

40:15.480 --> 40:17.767
Ain't no way Inky's catching up to you!

40:20.560 --> 40:23.980
I want you to focus mostly on the ships.

40:24.080 --> 40:27.660
Every 10,000 points,
you get another triangle ship.

40:27.760 --> 40:29.524
That's a good thing.

40:31.680 --> 40:32.841
Damn.

40:33.200 --> 40:35.340
He's still the master.

40:35.440 --> 40:39.206
This is just like when we were dating.
No distractions, just us.

40:39.800 --> 40:40.926
And cake.

40:41.040 --> 40:43.980
Big Man. Settle down there
with that butterscotch frosting.

40:44.080 --> 40:45.940
What? Too much? Well, you know what?

40:46.040 --> 40:48.780
You're really not gonna like what I do
with the rainbow sprinkles.

40:48.880 --> 40:51.780
- Come on now! No! I love it!
- Will! No!

40:51.880 --> 40:53.723
Here comes the sprinkle monster!

40:56.960 --> 40:58.041
Mr. President.

40:58.640 --> 40:59.700
Yes, Jennifer.

40:59.800 --> 41:02.940
We just received an alien transmission
from the "Where's the Beef?" lady.

41:03.040 --> 41:04.060
What did she say?

41:04.160 --> 41:06.380
First of all, she asked
where the beef was.

41:06.480 --> 41:09.460
Then she said that the next battle
was on at sundown tomorrow.

41:09.560 --> 41:13.060
5130' 29" latitude. 09' 42" longitude.

41:13.160 --> 41:14.207
Where is that?

41:37.080 --> 41:38.605
Go! Go! Go! Move! Move! Move!

41:48.920 --> 41:50.445
Clear the area!

41:50.760 --> 41:53.500
The lot of ya, come on! Move it!

41:53.600 --> 41:55.180
I said, move it!

41:55.280 --> 41:57.820
- What's all this then, mate?
- Hey, I got this. Hi.

41:57.920 --> 41:59.180
We're Americans.

41:59.280 --> 42:01.340
Our Navy SEALs were given permission
by your government

42:01.440 --> 42:04.260
to prepare
for an extraterrestrial invasion,

42:04.360 --> 42:07.842
which we believe will occur at these
coordinates in approximately 60 minutes.

42:09.040 --> 42:10.166
We're shootin' a beer commercial.

42:11.600 --> 42:13.648
Right, then. Break a leg, then, yeah?

42:15.280 --> 42:17.340
What was that, man?
Why'd you lie to him?

42:17.440 --> 42:20.125
I'm trying not to cause
total panic, Yank.

42:20.880 --> 42:21.961
And, you...

42:23.120 --> 42:26.522
I don't want to hear
another word out of you. All right?

42:28.520 --> 42:29.965
You walkin' wiener coat.

42:30.640 --> 42:32.802
What's a wiener coat?

42:36.400 --> 42:40.041
Madam Prime Minister, I can't thank you
enough for your cooperation on this.

42:40.160 --> 42:41.700
But of course, Will.

42:41.800 --> 42:44.060
Well, I trust with the concord
of our powers

42:44.160 --> 42:46.891
we can duff up the jiggery-pokery
of these blighters

42:47.000 --> 42:48.809
and send them scuffering back

42:48.920 --> 42:51.180
to the fractious firmament
from whence they came!

42:51.280 --> 42:52.281
I know, right?

42:52.920 --> 42:54.160
Bang on!

42:56.240 --> 42:58.004
No idea what she just said.

43:01.040 --> 43:03.008
I just wanna touch it.

43:03.720 --> 43:07.770
Easy with those light cannons, gentlemen.
We don't have any backups.

43:08.600 --> 43:10.580
These ray guns gonna work, Van Patten?

43:10.680 --> 43:12.060
We had no way to field-test them, sir.

43:12.160 --> 43:14.740
But our computer models show
a great likelihood of effectiveness.

43:14.840 --> 43:18.460
"Great likelihood"? You're sending my men
into battle with untested ordnance?

43:18.560 --> 43:21.723
I had two days to do things
never done before on this planet, sir.

43:22.200 --> 43:24.521
Just remember
who you're talking to, missy.

43:25.600 --> 43:26.580
All right!

43:26.680 --> 43:31.208
Anybody who doesn't need to be here,
follow me to the support area.

43:32.040 --> 43:33.690
That means you two nipple-twisters.

43:35.520 --> 43:36.567
Move it!

43:37.760 --> 43:40.206
Hey, Colonel. Don't worry.
They're gonna work.

43:42.520 --> 43:45.780
<i>The US military was attacked
and what does President Cooper do?</i>

43:45.880 --> 43:48.020
<i>His critics say, "Nothing."</i>

43:48.120 --> 43:51.260
<i>That's not strictly true.
He made a cake.</i>

43:51.360 --> 43:53.283
<i>No, because I'm the sprinkle monster!</i>

43:53.400 --> 43:55.084
<i>You are my sprinkle monster!</i>

43:57.400 --> 43:59.721
- Let's put that on pause, Sean.
- Thank you.

44:02.720 --> 44:04.051
Turn it off.

44:04.560 --> 44:05.891
Apologies, Will.

44:06.560 --> 44:10.020
Just wanted to spend some quality time
with the wife.

44:10.120 --> 44:11.500
I understand.

44:11.600 --> 44:14.620
My husband actually said that we don't
spend time together like we used to,

44:14.720 --> 44:18.460
so I took him to one of those
do-it-yourself pottery studios.

44:18.560 --> 44:22.406
And he made me a "World's Sexiest
Prime Minister" coffee mug.

44:22.840 --> 44:25.810
Well, maybe he sees somethin'
that nobody else does, you know.

44:28.600 --> 44:30.602
Anything, Colonel Van Patten?

44:31.080 --> 44:33.321
It's eerily quiet, Mr. President.

44:42.960 --> 44:43.980
In case it's <i>Space Invaders,</i>

44:44.080 --> 44:45.081
I just thought of something
I should tell...

44:45.200 --> 44:47.009
Please return to the support area!

44:47.120 --> 44:49.260
Okay, but there's a 5 plus 1 formation,
all right?

44:49.360 --> 44:52.842
If we need ya, we know where to find ya.
All right?

44:52.960 --> 44:54.325
Now, bugger off.

44:55.880 --> 44:57.291
Bloody geek.

45:36.480 --> 45:38.050
It's <i>Centipede.</i>

45:43.840 --> 45:46.740
Okay, boys! Do exactly
what we talked about!

45:46.840 --> 45:49.060
Shoot each centipede from the head down!

45:49.160 --> 45:53.051
Do not hit him in the middle
or he will split into two!

46:09.280 --> 46:12.180
No! No! Didn't we just say
don't split him in half?

46:12.280 --> 46:13.460
Shoot for the head!

46:13.560 --> 46:15.688
The mushroom things are in the way!

46:16.840 --> 46:18.888
You shoot the mushroom things!
Like the game!

46:22.560 --> 46:26.121
Guys, every time he hits a mushroom,
he's gonna change direction!

46:28.120 --> 46:31.420
My God! Will you please find the pattern
and anticipate!

46:31.520 --> 46:33.540
I don't know the patterns!

46:33.640 --> 46:35.483
Sergeant Duff! 12 o'clock!

46:50.640 --> 46:53.246
What the hell kind of
beer commercial is this?

46:53.720 --> 46:58.408
If I say it's a beer commercial,
it's a bloody beer commercial.

47:06.760 --> 47:08.410
Get your flabby ass back here, Yank!

47:30.960 --> 47:32.340
Shock and awe, baby!

47:32.440 --> 47:34.180
High score, alien trash!

47:34.280 --> 47:35.740
You messed with the wrong planet!

47:35.840 --> 47:37.820
From Land's End to John o'Groats!

47:37.920 --> 47:40.366
- What the hell are you saying?
- I don't know!

47:43.320 --> 47:47.260
Hey, Ludlow! Grab a light cannon!
Get out here now! I need your help!

47:47.360 --> 47:49.860
Me? No! Look at me! I look delicious!

47:49.960 --> 47:52.440
They'll gobble me up like space dim sum!

47:54.720 --> 47:56.020
It's level two!

47:56.120 --> 47:58.407
We're the only ones who can do this!

47:58.520 --> 48:00.363
Come on! You're the Wonder Kid!

48:00.480 --> 48:03.484
You have no authority
to dispense weapons here, Mr. Brenner!

48:03.800 --> 48:05.131
Mr. President?

48:05.720 --> 48:07.882
Let the nerds take over.

48:08.560 --> 48:10.020
<i>What was that, sir?</i>

48:10.120 --> 48:12.407
Let the nerds take over!

48:14.040 --> 48:15.724
Let the nerds take over!

48:17.360 --> 48:18.805
Brenner's right.

48:20.160 --> 48:21.810
I am the Wonder Kid.

48:41.160 --> 48:42.420
This is the best, huh?

48:42.520 --> 48:46.570
I've never been happier and more alive!

49:12.040 --> 49:14.725
Okay. You can let go of each other now.

49:24.360 --> 49:26.488
All right, you finish that.
I'll finish this.

49:32.280 --> 49:35.966
It's been 30 years since I kicked your butt,
and it's gonna happen again!

49:49.320 --> 49:50.651
<i>With the arms!</i>

49:51.160 --> 49:52.571
<i>Let's take it forward.</i>

49:54.440 --> 49:55.930
<i>Then take it back.</i>

49:58.280 --> 49:59.930
<i>- Enjoy it!</i>
- Hey!

50:06.600 --> 50:07.601
Come here!

50:09.080 --> 50:10.081
You little...

50:20.000 --> 50:22.580
Who are you, mister?

50:22.680 --> 50:25.650
Son, I'm just a loser
who's good at old video games.

50:26.200 --> 50:28.441
Well, thank God for that.

50:28.720 --> 50:30.609
Drinks are on the US government!

50:32.200 --> 50:33.860
Which is covering up the truth

50:33.960 --> 50:36.440
about the ancient pyramid
under the Hoover Dam!

50:38.800 --> 50:40.100
You know, you're all right, Brenner.

50:40.200 --> 50:42.123
You're all right too, snobby.

50:42.960 --> 50:45.860
You gonna nurse that all night long,
or when are you gonna start hittin' it?

50:45.960 --> 50:48.361
We ding up a few foreign belligerents,
beer is fine.

50:48.480 --> 50:50.660
We defeat a full-on alien invasion,

50:50.760 --> 50:53.604
I'm thinking something
a little stronger.

50:54.640 --> 50:58.900
No. You're really challenging me
to drink you under the table? You got it.

50:59.000 --> 51:00.968
I'm not so sure you can, buddy.

51:01.360 --> 51:03.780
I was the vodka shot record holder
in my class at West Point.

51:03.880 --> 51:06.100
Well, one time I drank
15 milkshakes at Denny's,

51:06.200 --> 51:07.884
so we'll see what happens.

51:08.360 --> 51:10.203
Where are my gamers at?

51:10.640 --> 51:13.820
Looks like all the time you wasted
when we were kids is finally payin' off.

51:13.920 --> 51:15.740
- Yeah, baby.
- All right, huh?

51:15.840 --> 51:18.047
Sir, may I have the honor
of pouring you a frosty?

51:18.480 --> 51:21.404
The President can't be seen drinking
during times of crisis.

51:22.680 --> 51:23.780
So nobody look!

51:23.880 --> 51:25.769
That's it. Look away!

51:26.360 --> 51:28.220
<i>Inhabitants of Earth.</i>

51:28.320 --> 51:31.881
<i>Congratulations,
you have won this battle.</i>

51:33.160 --> 51:37.529
<i>Please accept one of our warriors
as a trophy of your victory.</i>

51:46.360 --> 51:48.580
<i>The next challenge will not be as easy.</i>

51:48.680 --> 51:51.620
<i>The details will be sent
via this signal shortly</i>

51:51.720 --> 51:55.520
<i>Remember, we are still leading
two battles to one.</i>

51:56.200 --> 52:00.260
<i>One more loss for you will mean
the annihilation of your world.</i>

52:00.360 --> 52:02.966
<i>Good luck and may the best planet win.</i>

52:05.600 --> 52:06.647
Well, you heard 'em.

52:06.920 --> 52:08.206
Let's get back to work.

52:08.360 --> 52:10.140
We gotta get you guys
ready for your next battle.

52:10.240 --> 52:11.620
Battle? Us? Huh?

52:11.720 --> 52:13.290
This is like a regular thing now?

52:13.400 --> 52:16.210
Remember when I told you that
you were meant for something more in life?

52:16.320 --> 52:17.540
Yeah.

52:17.640 --> 52:19.300
This could be it, buddy.

52:19.400 --> 52:21.300
There's nobody better than you.

52:21.400 --> 52:22.401
Well,

52:23.560 --> 52:24.891
not at every game.

52:25.480 --> 52:28.131
No. No! Never gonna happen.

52:29.120 --> 52:30.406
You know, he's right, Brenner.

52:30.600 --> 52:33.080
We don't even know
where to find that idiot!

52:37.280 --> 52:40.140
<i>Eddie Plant.
Married and divorced four times,</i>

52:40.240 --> 52:43.740
<i>declared bankruptcy in 1991 and 2004.</i>

52:43.840 --> 52:46.140
In 2005, he was caught
hacking cell phone companies

52:46.240 --> 52:48.481
and adding one of those fees you see
on your bill every month,

52:48.600 --> 52:50.260
- but have no idea what it is.
- What an idiot.

52:50.360 --> 52:52.460
Made about 50 million
before he was convicted and sentenced

52:52.560 --> 52:54.449
to 20 years in prison.

52:58.360 --> 53:00.740
Guards, get me outta here.

53:00.840 --> 53:03.220
It's that mean Centipede killer.

53:03.320 --> 53:06.500
I hope he don't zap me
with his space gun.

53:06.600 --> 53:08.060
How are you, Eddie?

53:08.160 --> 53:10.020
'Sup, Second Place?

53:10.120 --> 53:12.380
And your sidekick here,

53:12.480 --> 53:13.766
Presi-donut.

53:14.480 --> 53:18.380
I didn't know you can have
an approval rating so catatastrophic.

53:18.480 --> 53:21.340
- Okay, look, Eddie, here's what we need.
- I know what you need.

53:21.440 --> 53:23.540
You need the Fire Blaster.

53:23.640 --> 53:24.900
Who's the Fire Blaster?

53:25.000 --> 53:27.731
Me. That's my nickname, sugar buns.

53:28.200 --> 53:30.580
Yeah. That's right.
The one you made up for yourself.

53:30.680 --> 53:32.220
Who cares who made it up?

53:32.320 --> 53:33.900
It's totally tubular!

53:34.000 --> 53:34.980
Yeah.

53:35.080 --> 53:40.060
See, this is why I don't think
I can have Brenner on my team.

53:40.160 --> 53:41.700
He's just not really a gamer.

53:41.800 --> 53:44.460
Break out a bag of quarters. Pick a game.
I'll destroy you at it.

53:44.560 --> 53:46.528
I'll pick a game, all right.

53:48.560 --> 53:51.380
- Okay. I'm leaving.
- No, no, no. Hey, here, come on.

53:51.480 --> 53:52.561
Sit down.

53:53.720 --> 53:55.380
Okay, in exchange for helping us,

53:55.480 --> 53:59.326
I will personally speak to the parole board
about reducing your sentence.

54:02.560 --> 54:04.642
- Pass.
- Pass?

54:05.000 --> 54:07.100
That deal don't work for Eddie Plant.

54:07.200 --> 54:10.488
You want the Fire Blaster's help,
he has some demands.

54:10.840 --> 54:12.080
Demands?

54:20.240 --> 54:22.402
The Bifocal Blaster is here, by the way.

54:26.520 --> 54:27.660
I want an island.

54:27.760 --> 54:28.900
Oh, my God.

54:29.000 --> 54:31.820
There are 18,617 named islands

54:31.920 --> 54:34.420
that are part of the United States
and its territories.

54:34.520 --> 54:37.740
Not to mention
all the countless unnamed ones,

54:37.840 --> 54:40.684
like the soon-to-be-called Edwahii.

54:41.360 --> 54:42.566
You're not getting an island.

54:43.440 --> 54:46.500
Then I want a full pardon.
I wanna get outta here for good.

54:46.600 --> 54:49.524
And after I do,
I don't wanna pay no taxes like,

54:49.640 --> 54:50.700
forever.

54:50.800 --> 54:53.860
And no sales tax.
If I wanna buy some, for instance, gum,

54:53.960 --> 54:56.700
I wanna flash me a card
that says "I saved the world."

54:56.800 --> 54:59.929
I don't have to pay
no shitballs taxes on the gum.

55:01.880 --> 55:05.260
And I want a stealth-attack helicopter,
like they fly over the Super Bowl

55:05.360 --> 55:07.340
at my disposal, at all times.

55:07.440 --> 55:09.124
You know, so I can fly around.

55:09.240 --> 55:12.562
If the world's still here,
I don't wanna deal with traffic no more.

55:13.760 --> 55:15.171
And lastly,

55:16.560 --> 55:18.847
I want you to set up
a romantic rendezvous

55:18.960 --> 55:22.300
between me,
Serena Williams and Martha Stewart

55:22.400 --> 55:24.860
in the Lincoln Bedroom.

55:24.960 --> 55:29.124
Number one. You're not getting a helicopter
or any sort of flying or driving vehicle.

55:29.320 --> 55:31.561
Number two.
I'm pretty sure the federal government

55:31.680 --> 55:34.140
could do without your income taxes
and be fine.

55:34.240 --> 55:38.740
And number three.
If you help us beat these things,

55:38.840 --> 55:40.808
I think we can get you outta here.

55:42.080 --> 55:44.526
And the Martha-Serena sandwich?

55:44.960 --> 55:47.060
Pick one of 'em. We'll set up a coffee.

55:47.160 --> 55:48.924
Serena Williams. And we are closed.

55:52.920 --> 55:53.921
Hello?

55:55.280 --> 55:56.691
I understand.

55:58.160 --> 56:00.020
It's happening tonight.

56:00.120 --> 56:01.180
Where?

56:01.280 --> 56:02.281
New York City.

56:04.000 --> 56:05.650
Fuhgeddaboutit!

56:26.600 --> 56:28.020
Hello, Big Apple.

56:28.120 --> 56:30.851
The cavalry has arrived.

56:37.600 --> 56:39.060
Thanks for comin'.

56:39.160 --> 56:42.260
We saw how you guys
took care of the centipedes.

56:42.360 --> 56:44.060
We hope you can do the same for us.

56:44.160 --> 56:46.845
We hope so also.
Well, what are we dealin' with?

56:47.520 --> 56:48.851
Over here.

56:50.520 --> 56:53.729
Rookie, just tell 'em what you saw.

56:55.000 --> 56:56.580
It was awful.

56:56.680 --> 56:59.180
It was like one of those monster movies,
you know?

56:59.280 --> 57:00.340
But this time

57:00.440 --> 57:01.940
the monster was real.

57:02.040 --> 57:03.963
And who was this monster?

57:05.520 --> 57:06.740
Pac-Man.

57:06.840 --> 57:08.740
Pac-Man? Boom. That's my jam.

57:08.840 --> 57:10.740
Let's get us some light cannons
and blow this sucker back

57:10.840 --> 57:12.260
to whatever planet it came from.

57:12.360 --> 57:14.740
No! No, light cannons
don't kill Pac-Man.

57:14.840 --> 57:16.300
Those little ghosts do.

57:16.400 --> 57:18.780
Boom! Let's get us some little ghosts.

57:18.880 --> 57:20.484
You want ghosts?

57:21.040 --> 57:22.530
She's got ghosts.

57:32.360 --> 57:35.420
We used the energy force-field
technology from the cube

57:35.520 --> 57:38.420
to develop four mini-generators
for each of the cars.

57:38.520 --> 57:39.487
Ghosts.

57:39.600 --> 57:42.860
We're calling them XM950 attack modules.

57:42.960 --> 57:44.500
Okay and we're callin' 'em Mini Ghosts

57:44.600 --> 57:47.060
'cause we'll never remember
what you just said.

57:47.160 --> 57:49.481
Why are there four of 'em?
There's only three of us. Who's our fourth?

57:50.000 --> 57:53.402
May I introduce to you
Professor Toru Iwatani.

57:55.880 --> 57:57.564
The creator of <i>Pac-Man.</i>

58:12.800 --> 58:14.140
You speak Japanese?

58:14.240 --> 58:15.571
No.

58:16.800 --> 58:17.940
Sir, what an honor.

58:18.040 --> 58:20.327
Thanks for all the joy
you brought to our lives.

58:20.640 --> 58:21.880
Awesome.

58:23.800 --> 58:26.565
I made your game my bitch.

58:29.280 --> 58:31.100
What is a

58:31.200 --> 58:32.420
"bitch"?

58:32.520 --> 58:34.124
Don't worry about it. He's a criminal.

58:39.640 --> 58:41.540
- You all right?
- Yeah.

58:41.640 --> 58:44.980
Okay, now, assuming they play by the rules
of the game like they did with <i>Centipede,</i>

58:45.080 --> 58:48.926
if you guys hit Pac-Man three times
with this energy field, we win.

58:49.240 --> 58:51.163
Ludlow's right. You do smell good.

58:53.160 --> 58:54.810
- Good luck.
- Yeah.

59:08.440 --> 59:10.820
Gentlemen, I'll be sending
Pac-Man's current coordinates

59:10.920 --> 59:12.604
to each of your car's GPSes.

59:12.800 --> 59:14.131
<i>Let's locate and eliminate.</i>

59:16.480 --> 59:17.606
Come on, guys.

59:37.000 --> 59:39.002
Pac-Man's a bad guy?

59:43.960 --> 59:45.849
Pac-Man is not bad!

59:46.520 --> 59:49.842
I created him to bring joy
to all the people of the world.

59:50.000 --> 59:51.206
They have brainwashed him!

59:53.680 --> 59:57.651
Deep down, he's kind, gentle.

59:58.880 --> 01:00:02.202
Someone you can tell your troubles to
or grab a hamburger with.

01:00:07.640 --> 01:00:08.880
You'll see.

01:00:13.200 --> 01:00:15.420
Professor Iwatani, get back in the car!

01:00:15.520 --> 01:00:17.460
Professor Iwatani, what are you doin'?

01:00:17.560 --> 01:00:20.006
I will talk to him. He's my son!

01:00:20.160 --> 01:00:21.491
No, that's a bad idea.

01:00:29.080 --> 01:00:30.525
Hello,

01:00:31.240 --> 01:00:33.208
my sweet little boy.

01:00:34.160 --> 01:00:36.003
Look how big you've grown!

01:00:36.680 --> 01:00:38.569
I'm so proud of you.

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:41.367
It's so sweet. He's so sweet.

01:00:43.240 --> 01:00:45.620
But all these destructive things
you're doing,

01:00:45.720 --> 01:00:47.006
it's wrong.

01:00:48.840 --> 01:00:50.444
I'm your father.

01:00:53.520 --> 01:00:54.760
I know

01:00:55.280 --> 01:00:56.406
you're a good boy.

01:01:04.080 --> 01:01:05.206
No!

01:01:07.360 --> 01:01:10.364
Somebody kill this stupid bitch!

01:01:11.880 --> 01:01:16.761
That was some twisted
Pinocchio-Geppetto stuff right there.

01:01:19.960 --> 01:01:21.291
All right, losers!

01:01:22.080 --> 01:01:23.491
It's three on one.

01:01:23.760 --> 01:01:24.921
Let's hit it.

01:01:54.640 --> 01:01:56.802
Pac-Man's faster than I remember.

01:02:00.120 --> 01:02:02.300
Pac-Man's always been faster
than the ghosts.

01:02:02.400 --> 01:02:04.562
We're gonna have to outmaneuver his ass.

01:02:14.120 --> 01:02:17.363
<i>Wonderfro, you
and Silver Medal break off.</i>

01:02:18.520 --> 01:02:20.488
I'll stay with Big Yellow.

01:02:24.480 --> 01:02:26.482
Whoa, Eddie,
how did you do that so fast?

01:02:26.680 --> 01:02:28.523
'Cause I'm the champ,
Lieutenant Long Legs.

01:02:34.240 --> 01:02:35.321
Nope!

01:02:36.960 --> 01:02:37.961
What's up?

01:02:41.520 --> 01:02:43.010
Yeah!

01:02:49.040 --> 01:02:50.201
Good one, Eddie.

01:02:52.200 --> 01:02:53.420
<i>One down.</i>

01:02:53.520 --> 01:02:54.567
Two to go!

01:03:00.040 --> 01:03:01.420
All right, Pac-Man Number Two

01:03:01.520 --> 01:03:04.251
just regenerated four streets away
headed northbound.

01:03:04.720 --> 01:03:06.768
<i>Turn east at the next intersection.</i>

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:09.001
<i>Brenner, go straight.</i>

01:03:09.240 --> 01:03:10.260
Got it.

01:03:10.360 --> 01:03:11.725
<i>Ludlow, go left.</i>

01:03:13.240 --> 01:03:16.050
<i>Eddie, at the next intersection,
turn left.</i>

01:03:17.200 --> 01:03:18.260
We got him!

01:03:18.360 --> 01:03:20.203
He's got nowhere to go!

01:03:25.920 --> 01:03:28.127
Oh, God. No!

01:03:28.240 --> 01:03:29.300
"Oh, God. No," what?

01:03:29.400 --> 01:03:30.660
He ate the power pellet.

01:03:30.760 --> 01:03:33.127
Pac-Man's got 10 seconds
where he can eat us.

01:03:36.360 --> 01:03:37.885
Why me?

01:03:45.560 --> 01:03:47.420
God. Don't eat me,
don't eat me, don't eat me.

01:03:47.520 --> 01:03:48.931
Please, please, don't eat me!

01:03:55.560 --> 01:03:57.540
Guys! Help!

01:03:57.640 --> 01:03:59.768
I'm gonna die a virgin!

01:04:13.880 --> 01:04:16.611
Why are you doing this to me?

01:04:18.560 --> 01:04:20.483
You've been brainwashed!

01:04:20.640 --> 01:04:23.166
You're a good boy!

01:04:23.440 --> 01:04:25.442
Ludlow, run! Pump your legs! Go, baby!

01:04:30.400 --> 01:04:31.970
Attaboy, Eddie!

01:04:33.440 --> 01:04:36.171
You just got fire-blasted, sucka.

01:04:39.800 --> 01:04:40.961
What?

01:04:41.480 --> 01:04:43.801
How the hell did he get
over there so fast?

01:04:45.680 --> 01:04:46.841
Way to go, champ.

01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:49.367
Aren't you glad you sprung me,
Second Place?

01:04:49.640 --> 01:04:51.500
Yeah, thrilled.

01:04:51.600 --> 01:04:54.206
One more to go and it's happy hour.

01:05:04.800 --> 01:05:07.531
So I guess they're just leaving me here.

01:05:12.840 --> 01:05:15.161
Now it's time for the hat trick.

01:05:27.280 --> 01:05:28.327
Wow!

01:05:28.640 --> 01:05:30.300
Brenner, it's on you.

01:05:30.400 --> 01:05:32.940
There are still three other
power pellets out there.

01:05:33.040 --> 01:05:34.530
<i>So stay alert.</i>

01:05:34.720 --> 01:05:35.801
I got this.

01:05:36.480 --> 01:05:37.900
If I don't,

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:39.684
the world ends.

01:05:39.840 --> 01:05:41.365
Can't let that happen.

01:05:41.520 --> 01:05:43.682
Come on, Brenner. Come on.

01:05:49.400 --> 01:05:52.220
Brenner, he's leading you directly
towards one of the power pellets.

01:05:52.320 --> 01:05:53.765
<i>Get out of there.</i>

01:06:01.680 --> 01:06:02.681
One.

01:06:03.200 --> 01:06:04.361
What the hell is he doing?

01:06:05.800 --> 01:06:06.780
Two.

01:06:06.880 --> 01:06:10.140
<i>Damn it, Brenner. I have a son
who I'd like to see grow up.</i>

01:06:10.240 --> 01:06:12.049
Three. You'll see your boy grow up.

01:06:15.400 --> 01:06:16.420
Four.

01:06:16.520 --> 01:06:19.251
Brenner, get out! He's going to eat you!

01:06:21.400 --> 01:06:22.447
Five.

01:06:24.920 --> 01:06:26.001
Six.

01:06:28.040 --> 01:06:29.087
Seven.

01:06:31.200 --> 01:06:32.326
Eight.

01:06:33.680 --> 01:06:34.841
Nine.

01:06:40.200 --> 01:06:41.247
Ten.

01:06:51.080 --> 01:06:54.289
You did it! Brenner!
That's the one, baby!

01:07:05.280 --> 01:07:06.805
He's over here!

01:07:31.960 --> 01:07:34.327
Fire Blaster, I love you!

01:07:34.840 --> 01:07:35.940
Hey, guys!

01:07:36.040 --> 01:07:38.820
Sorry. Coming through.
I'm one of tonight's heroes. Sorry.

01:07:38.920 --> 01:07:40.001
Hey!

01:07:40.320 --> 01:07:41.367
Hey.

01:07:41.960 --> 01:07:43.200
Check it out.

01:07:44.160 --> 01:07:46.925
I think I might have found
our next trophy.

01:07:51.320 --> 01:07:52.651
It's Q*bert.

01:07:52.800 --> 01:07:55.007
Yeah, I know! I know.

01:07:55.840 --> 01:07:57.100
Can I kill it?

01:07:57.200 --> 01:07:58.326
No!

01:07:58.480 --> 01:08:01.563
Let's get to know him a little bit.
Ask him some questions.

01:08:01.680 --> 01:08:02.966
And then we'll kill him.

01:08:04.680 --> 01:08:07.411
- I'm joking. Just put the blanket on him.
- Bye.

01:08:07.520 --> 01:08:08.940
- Mr. President!
- Mr. President!

01:08:09.040 --> 01:08:10.260
- Yes, Hal.
- Mr. President,

01:08:10.360 --> 01:08:13.900
your approval ratings have tripled
since this crisis began.

01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:17.020
Do you feel the heretofore
sanguine causata

01:08:17.120 --> 01:08:19.327
are tracking toward
an auspicious denouement?

01:08:20.960 --> 01:08:22.580
Shut up, Hal.

01:08:22.680 --> 01:08:25.444
You're just using big words
to try to make him look like an idiot.

01:08:26.560 --> 01:08:29.211
We love you, Mr. President.
Thank you for saving us.

01:08:30.479 --> 01:08:32.300
Please, don't thank me.

01:08:32.399 --> 01:08:35.881
It's Sam Brenner and his team who have
brought us here to the brink of victory.

01:08:36.160 --> 01:08:38.242
<i>And we understand
you're holding a soirée in their honor.</i>

01:08:38.560 --> 01:08:41.848
<i>Is that a good idea when another attack
may be imminent?</i>

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:43.140
<i>No need to worry.</i>

01:08:43.240 --> 01:08:46.180
They will have their Arcader uniforms on
underneath their tuxes,

01:08:46.279 --> 01:08:48.362
ready to go at a moment's notice.

01:08:48.720 --> 01:08:50.220
And for the record, Hal,

01:08:50.319 --> 01:08:53.368
I happen to know
what several of those big words meant.

01:08:54.040 --> 01:08:57.725
I drank a few cold sanguines
on my last trip to México.

01:08:58.880 --> 01:09:00.609
Bite on that, Hal!

01:09:00.880 --> 01:09:03.724
You! You! You! You! You!

01:09:10.720 --> 01:09:12.721
I don't know what would be worse.

01:09:13.560 --> 01:09:15.085
Them failing,

01:09:15.560 --> 01:09:18.140
or them actually pulling this off.

01:09:18.240 --> 01:09:19.620
What was that, Jim?

01:09:19.720 --> 01:09:22.087
Can you shut up for five seconds?

01:09:26.800 --> 01:09:28.779
We need to increase the rate of fire.

01:09:28.880 --> 01:09:31.929
Now you already calculated
that in your beautiful mind, didn't you?

01:09:33.720 --> 01:09:35.768
There's no rhyme or reason to this game.

01:09:35.920 --> 01:09:39.140
I mean, where are the patterns?
He just attacks out of left field.

01:09:39.240 --> 01:09:42.288
Patterns? Is that why you were so good
with <i>Pac-Man</i> and <i>Centipede?</i>

01:09:42.439 --> 01:09:43.779
You memorized the patterns?

01:09:43.880 --> 01:09:45.660
Yeah. Only way to beat these things.

01:09:45.760 --> 01:09:48.819
Count the bullets, calculate the speed,
crunch the numbers.

01:09:48.920 --> 01:09:50.180
Where's the fun in that?

01:09:50.279 --> 01:09:52.009
Boy. Why? What do you do?

01:09:52.160 --> 01:09:55.164
You gotta pretend you're the guy
and you don't wanna die.

01:09:55.320 --> 01:09:58.860
Yeah, that sounds cool,
but it's not gonna work every time.

01:09:58.960 --> 01:10:01.167
Well, that's why you have
your reset button.

01:10:01.480 --> 01:10:03.642
Yeah, we didn't have those growin' up.

01:10:05.120 --> 01:10:07.060
Most violent game I've ever seen.

01:10:07.160 --> 01:10:08.820
I don't think it's healthy for you.

01:10:08.920 --> 01:10:10.060
It's fine. I can handle it.

01:10:10.160 --> 01:10:12.447
No, I'm not talkin' to you.
I'm talkin' to homeboy.

01:10:13.800 --> 01:10:16.326
So much blood!

01:10:16.640 --> 01:10:19.007
Yeah. Hey.
You know what'll cheer you up?

01:10:19.160 --> 01:10:20.969
- A cheese ball.
- Yep.

01:10:22.280 --> 01:10:23.645
Come on, suck one up.

01:10:24.800 --> 01:10:25.961
Take a handful.

01:10:27.960 --> 01:10:31.203
That was smooth. That was very smooth.

01:10:31.360 --> 01:10:33.140
You know,
we should get him some exercise.

01:10:33.240 --> 01:10:35.004
Maybe throw him
on the trampoline for a little bit?

01:10:35.160 --> 01:10:37.380
Trampoline! Trampoline! Trampoline!

01:10:37.480 --> 01:10:38.900
Okay. How about me and him do that

01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:42.049
while you go ask my mom
to the ball tomorrow night?

01:10:42.360 --> 01:10:44.647
Unfortunately,
I'm not attracted to your mother.

01:10:44.840 --> 01:10:46.490
Bullcrap.

01:10:46.640 --> 01:10:48.210
You're right, I am. Okay.

01:10:48.360 --> 01:10:49.850
Here. Finish these.

01:10:50.520 --> 01:10:52.010
You're gettin' chubby.

01:10:54.840 --> 01:10:55.966
Hi.

01:10:56.640 --> 01:10:57.687
Hi.

01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:00.161
So...

01:11:01.400 --> 01:11:02.526
So...

01:11:09.440 --> 01:11:10.700
Sorry!

01:11:10.800 --> 01:11:12.962
Again! Again! Again! Again!

01:11:13.800 --> 01:11:17.740
So I'm feeling obligated to make
an appearance at that thing tomorrow night.

01:11:17.840 --> 01:11:19.620
I was wondering, when you got there,

01:11:19.720 --> 01:11:23.420
if possibly you'd like to hang out
with me while I was there?

01:11:23.520 --> 01:11:25.860
- Like a date?
- Like a date, but... Yeah.

01:11:25.960 --> 01:11:27.380
I dunno about that.

01:11:27.480 --> 01:11:29.780
I'm a snob.
I have mental problems, so...

01:11:29.880 --> 01:11:32.060
Well, you know, you are and you do,

01:11:32.160 --> 01:11:34.686
but I'm willin' to overlook that
for the evening.

01:11:35.200 --> 01:11:36.140
Okay.

01:11:36.240 --> 01:11:37.526
You will?

01:11:51.320 --> 01:11:52.731
Three, four.

01:11:55.760 --> 01:11:58.140
- Thank you. Thank you.
- Thanks.

01:11:58.240 --> 01:12:00.049
Nice welcome, for a change, huh?

01:12:05.720 --> 01:12:08.371
Bring it down, Travolta. Bring it down.

01:12:11.080 --> 01:12:14.084
They love the Big Man!
Good to see the respect, pal.

01:12:17.720 --> 01:12:19.100
Well, lookie here, Serena.

01:12:19.200 --> 01:12:21.680
They threw me a big party to thank me
for savin' the world.

01:12:22.240 --> 01:12:24.368
And you get to stand
next to me all night.

01:12:24.800 --> 01:12:26.723
- Champagne, sir?
- Thanks.

01:12:27.200 --> 01:12:29.441
They promised me
an island if I did this.

01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:31.900
I'm dying to meet Sam's new ladyfriend.

01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:34.740
She's nothin'.
It's just a little hangin' out thing.

01:12:34.840 --> 01:12:35.966
Yeah, right.

01:12:36.160 --> 01:12:37.685
Is she pretty, Will?

01:12:38.640 --> 01:12:40.961
Define pretty. I mean, you're pretty.

01:12:41.360 --> 01:12:43.140
- Extremely pretty.
- Thank you.

01:12:43.240 --> 01:12:47.340
She, I think, in the classical sense
of the word, is certainly... I mean, I feel...

01:12:47.440 --> 01:12:50.205
- Brenner, help me out here.
- No, you're doing great. Keep going.

01:12:51.240 --> 01:12:54.926
You know, she, for military personnel,
certainly. I mean...

01:12:55.080 --> 01:12:56.764
You're the First Lady,

01:12:56.920 --> 01:12:58.365
she's a 10.

01:13:03.680 --> 01:13:04.966
Hey, Brenner.

01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:08.490
Hey, Brenner.

01:13:09.520 --> 01:13:11.488
Excuse me for a second.

01:13:12.080 --> 01:13:14.526
Come on, Matty. Let's dance!

01:13:19.920 --> 01:13:21.285
You look nice in a tux.

01:13:22.240 --> 01:13:24.481
Green's officially
my favorite color now.

01:13:25.400 --> 01:13:27.050
I have a question for you.

01:13:27.200 --> 01:13:30.647
President said I'm on call tonight,
so I can only have half a beer.

01:13:31.640 --> 01:13:34.564
I know you like drinkin'
out of sippy cups,

01:13:34.680 --> 01:13:36.170
but wanna split a bottle with me?

01:13:38.280 --> 01:13:39.566
What happened?

01:13:40.080 --> 01:13:42.260
- You brushed your teeth.
- Yes!

01:13:42.360 --> 01:13:43.500
All right. Lead the way.

01:13:43.600 --> 01:13:44.761
You got it.

01:14:07.600 --> 01:14:09.887
So let's hear about Sinnamon.
What does she look like?

01:14:10.040 --> 01:14:11.980
- God. Are you kidding?
- I wanna know.

01:14:12.080 --> 01:14:15.050
She's a husband-stealing
Pilates teacher. She's hot!

01:14:15.440 --> 01:14:16.487
And limber.

01:14:17.440 --> 01:14:18.420
That doesn't matter.

01:14:18.520 --> 01:14:20.568
Yes! Actually, it does.

01:14:20.880 --> 01:14:22.540
She's not perfect, though, right?

01:14:22.640 --> 01:14:24.529
Girls like that who steal husbands,

01:14:24.800 --> 01:14:26.962
they always got one thing
wrong with them.

01:14:27.240 --> 01:14:28.321
Come on.

01:14:29.040 --> 01:14:31.420
- Her forehead's too big?
- No.

01:14:31.520 --> 01:14:32.900
- Mole on the chin?
- No.

01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:34.809
- Two different nostrils?
- No!

01:14:36.040 --> 01:14:37.690
She's flawless.

01:14:37.960 --> 01:14:39.246
She is.

01:14:39.640 --> 01:14:43.247
I mean, her eyes.
Okay, her eyes are a little far apart.

01:14:44.800 --> 01:14:46.060
Kind of looks like a flounder.

01:14:46.160 --> 01:14:48.420
There it is! Good.

01:14:48.520 --> 01:14:52.020
So tonight, your dopey ex-husband's
gonna be lookin' into those eyes and sayin',

01:14:52.120 --> 01:14:53.980
"What kind of choice did I make?

01:14:54.080 --> 01:14:56.540
"I used to stare into the most
beautiful eyes I've ever seen,

01:14:56.640 --> 01:15:00.740
"and now I'm stuck starin'
at the Filet o' Fish sandwich."

01:15:00.840 --> 01:15:02.444
Did you just say I have beautiful eyes?

01:15:02.640 --> 01:15:04.529
While insulting the other chick.

01:15:05.720 --> 01:15:08.220
That is really, really,
really, really good.

01:15:08.320 --> 01:15:09.651
Thank you.

01:15:11.720 --> 01:15:14.929
Can I have some of that? No?
I thought we were splitting it.

01:15:39.600 --> 01:15:41.820
You know, everybody's like,

01:15:41.920 --> 01:15:44.340
"Brenner this" and "Brenner that."

01:15:44.440 --> 01:15:48.331
But make no mistake,
Fire Blaster's the leader of this crew.

01:15:48.520 --> 01:15:50.124
Who's the Fire Blaster again?

01:15:50.280 --> 01:15:53.380
Me, Serena! All right, lemme
just cut to the chase here.

01:15:53.480 --> 01:15:55.420
Fire Blaster's been in prison
for eight years.

01:15:55.520 --> 01:15:58.126
He hasn't been with a woman since '05.

01:15:58.880 --> 01:16:02.460
You're in for the time of your life.

01:16:02.560 --> 01:16:05.325
You even think about touching me,
I'm gonna smack you through the wall.

01:16:05.640 --> 01:16:07.130
I'd have it no other way.

01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:12.082
Should've gone with Martha Stewart.

01:16:12.480 --> 01:16:16.087
At least then, I'd have a tasty panini
cooked for me or some shit.

01:16:19.320 --> 01:16:21.260
So, what are you gonna do
after all this?

01:16:21.360 --> 01:16:23.362
You gonna go back to the Nerd Brigade?

01:16:25.080 --> 01:16:26.740
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:16:26.840 --> 01:16:29.002
Probably. I mean...

01:16:29.640 --> 01:16:30.801
What else would I do?

01:16:31.040 --> 01:16:33.327
I mean, it just seems like
someone with your skills,

01:16:33.440 --> 01:16:36.569
you'd be better off inventing technology
rather than installing it.

01:16:36.880 --> 01:16:40.407
No, of course.
I would love to do somethin' different.

01:16:40.800 --> 01:16:42.500
You know, I had my shot

01:16:42.600 --> 01:16:44.489
when I was a kid in the arcades.

01:16:45.120 --> 01:16:46.201
But

01:16:47.280 --> 01:16:48.566
I blew it.

01:16:49.080 --> 01:16:52.084
Yeah, I always think maybe my life
would've been different.

01:16:52.520 --> 01:16:55.300
Any time I'm getting on a roll,

01:16:55.400 --> 01:16:58.961
or I feel like everything's going great,

01:16:59.960 --> 01:17:02.804
that giant ape throws
another barrel at me.

01:17:05.560 --> 01:17:09.451
But it's all good. Don't worry.

01:17:13.320 --> 01:17:17.380
Ladies and gentlemen,
I am proud to introduce a special message

01:17:17.480 --> 01:17:21.121
to the Arcaders
from the students of PS 427

01:17:21.600 --> 01:17:23.250
in New York City.

01:17:26.400 --> 01:17:28.767
<i>New York was in trouble.</i>

01:17:28.960 --> 01:17:30.980
<i>Pac-Man caused a ruckus.</i>

01:17:31.080 --> 01:17:33.580
<i>But the Arcaders saved us.</i>

01:17:33.680 --> 01:17:35.603
<i>'Cause they're bad mother...</i>

01:17:39.720 --> 01:17:40.926
<i>People of Earth,</i>

01:17:41.240 --> 01:17:43.481
<i>you have violated
the rules of warfare, dudes.</i>

01:17:43.840 --> 01:17:45.171
Violated the rules?

01:17:45.320 --> 01:17:48.881
<i>Because of this,
you forfeit and your planet is now ours.</i>

01:17:49.920 --> 01:17:54.084
<i>Dudes, in 12 hours, we'll commence with
the all-out destruction of Earth.</i>

01:17:55.080 --> 01:17:59.324
<i>After that, we will sing this
about your precious planet.</i>

01:17:59.480 --> 01:18:03.700
<i>She's gone</i>

01:18:03.800 --> 01:18:06.565
<i>I'd better learn how to face...</i>

01:18:07.600 --> 01:18:09.364
What the heck are they talkin' about?

01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:20.650
Where you goin', Fire Blaster?

01:18:20.840 --> 01:18:22.080
Hey, kid.

01:18:22.880 --> 01:18:25.281
I told Serena
I needed to get some air, you know?

01:18:25.440 --> 01:18:27.140
Only known her half an hour
and she's already like,

01:18:27.240 --> 01:18:29.641
"Mrs. Fire Blaster this. Mrs.
Fire Blaster that."

01:18:30.400 --> 01:18:33.643
A cop fished these out of the East River
the night you fell in.

01:18:33.800 --> 01:18:35.580
I was gonna give 'em back to you,

01:18:35.680 --> 01:18:38.809
but I saw some interesting things
written on the inside of the lenses.

01:18:40.400 --> 01:18:42.562
The <i>Pac-Man</i> cheat code for super-speed.

01:18:43.040 --> 01:18:44.883
- You're a cheater.
- So what?

01:18:45.520 --> 01:18:48.700
I used cheat codes back in the day
to help me dominate.

01:18:48.800 --> 01:18:51.660
So I figured, why not use it
for the big show. And it worked.

01:18:51.760 --> 01:18:53.762
You've been a cheater your whole life?

01:18:54.560 --> 01:18:55.700
No.

01:18:55.800 --> 01:18:58.060
Only since I was 10.

01:18:58.160 --> 01:19:02.324
That's how I beat your boy Brenner
at the World Championship. Yeah.

01:19:04.280 --> 01:19:07.284
I owe everything I have
to these bitchin' shades.

01:19:12.680 --> 01:19:13.820
What did you do?

01:19:13.920 --> 01:19:17.220
I didn't do anything.
I thought we obeyed every rule.

01:19:17.320 --> 01:19:18.900
Ya thought wrong, civilian!

01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:21.180
We squandered our one chance on you!

01:19:21.280 --> 01:19:22.660
A hi-fi repair man.

01:19:22.760 --> 01:19:23.900
But I swear...

01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:27.368
But nothin'! You heard Hall & Oates!
You blew it!

01:19:27.600 --> 01:19:28.681
I've seen your files.

01:19:28.840 --> 01:19:31.047
You've never accomplished
a damn thing in your entire life.

01:19:31.160 --> 01:19:34.300
Brenner won two battles, Admiral.
That's two more than you.

01:19:34.400 --> 01:19:36.020
I wouldn't get smart with me, Colonel.

01:19:36.120 --> 01:19:39.203
You were all over this sideshow that did
nothing but waste valuable time.

01:19:39.480 --> 01:19:42.165
Sometimes I wonder if you're not working
for the Martians yourself!

01:19:42.320 --> 01:19:43.460
Drop dead, Admiral.

01:19:43.560 --> 01:19:44.540
You're done.

01:19:44.640 --> 01:19:48.281
All right. Hey, guys! That's enough. Listen.
We tried something. It didn't work.

01:19:51.040 --> 01:19:52.280
What is that?

01:19:52.640 --> 01:19:53.766
Matty!

01:20:04.880 --> 01:20:06.609
Matty!

01:20:13.240 --> 01:20:16.483
I can't believe they took Matty
as a trophy. I am so sorry.

01:20:16.640 --> 01:20:18.563
Well, there's gotta be
somethin' we can do.

01:20:18.720 --> 01:20:19.660
Where's Eddie?

01:20:19.760 --> 01:20:23.128
Eddie. Yeah. He crawled into a hole.
We'll never see him again.

01:20:24.120 --> 01:20:25.884
Chewie won't take my calls.

01:20:26.040 --> 01:20:28.380
Violet got the boot.
We're on our own, guys.

01:20:28.480 --> 01:20:30.020
This feels like my planet.

01:20:30.120 --> 01:20:33.806
No fun. No laughter. Only war.

01:20:34.080 --> 01:20:35.081
Wait.

01:20:35.360 --> 01:20:38.660
Wait a second. Q*bert is from there.
He knows all their secrets.

01:20:38.760 --> 01:20:40.300
We were once a happy planet.

01:20:40.400 --> 01:20:42.140
Before you threatened us.

01:20:42.240 --> 01:20:45.767
But we didn't threaten you!
You saw footage of old games.

01:20:46.120 --> 01:20:47.770
They do not know they are games.

01:20:47.920 --> 01:20:50.380
Well, why don't you tell them
that, Q*bert, and stop them?

01:20:50.480 --> 01:20:51.500
It's too late.

01:20:51.600 --> 01:20:55.300
And now the mothership is creating
millions of video-game warriors

01:20:55.400 --> 01:20:56.890
to destroy your planet.

01:20:57.360 --> 01:21:00.967
Look, all we have to do is get inside
the mothership and try to stop them.

01:21:01.120 --> 01:21:02.724
We can rescue Matty
while we're up there.

01:21:02.920 --> 01:21:04.809
Up there. You wanna go up there?

01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:08.243
I don't know about that.
You know, they took away our light cannons.

01:21:08.400 --> 01:21:10.084
I don't think that's such a good idea.

01:21:10.240 --> 01:21:12.607
We have something better
than light cannons.

01:21:12.800 --> 01:21:14.928
We have a positive can-do attitude.

01:21:16.520 --> 01:21:19.285
I'm kidding. We are all gonna die.

01:21:20.160 --> 01:21:21.286
I'm just...

01:21:21.520 --> 01:21:22.726
Sorry.

01:22:02.280 --> 01:22:03.700
Are you sure we wanna do this?

01:22:03.800 --> 01:22:06.280
I mean, maybe we could just find
another planet to live on.

01:22:06.480 --> 01:22:08.847
Shut up, dude.
We're gettin' on that ship.

01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:11.446
And the only way to do that is
to get directly under it.

01:22:11.840 --> 01:22:13.365
That's the only way in.

01:22:28.200 --> 01:22:30.248
Arcaders are comin'! Don't worry!

01:22:35.240 --> 01:22:36.780
Come on! Come on! Come on! Go!

01:22:36.880 --> 01:22:37.881
Stay with me!

01:22:56.280 --> 01:22:58.521
Nobody's better
at the crane game than me.

01:22:58.840 --> 01:23:00.171
Chewie?

01:23:00.320 --> 01:23:02.209
What's with the disguise, buddy?

01:23:02.360 --> 01:23:04.420
They tried to take me
to some underground bunker,

01:23:04.520 --> 01:23:06.204
so I went rogue.

01:23:10.200 --> 01:23:11.929
Yeah!

01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:16.140
Wonder Kid, you gotta stay on the ground.
These people need protection.

01:23:16.240 --> 01:23:17.241
Thank God.

01:23:17.400 --> 01:23:20.006
Hey, live long, laugh much, love often.

01:23:21.400 --> 01:23:22.447
That's it.

01:23:23.120 --> 01:23:24.300
No.

01:23:24.400 --> 01:23:25.606
Back it up.

01:23:26.960 --> 01:23:28.121
Thanks for bein' my friend.

01:23:28.680 --> 01:23:30.091
'Course, buddy. I love ya.

01:23:30.240 --> 01:23:32.083
Now go kick some ass.

01:23:34.800 --> 01:23:37.087
Mr. President,
may I have a light cannon?

01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:55.968
Don't tell anyone I killed a Smurf.

01:24:12.960 --> 01:24:14.180
Hey!

01:24:14.280 --> 01:24:16.328
Get away from those kids now!

01:24:18.080 --> 01:24:19.127
Please?

01:24:28.800 --> 01:24:29.801
Hey!

01:24:52.640 --> 01:24:56.060
I spent most of my formative years

01:24:56.160 --> 01:24:58.162
trying to figure out a way
to bring you to life

01:24:58.640 --> 01:25:00.608
all Weird Science-style.

01:25:01.480 --> 01:25:03.500
I used every birthday wish,

01:25:03.600 --> 01:25:06.046
every 11:11 on the clock,

01:25:06.160 --> 01:25:09.528
every little chicken wishbone
I could find, and ladybug.

01:25:10.040 --> 01:25:11.610
I prayed for this.

01:25:16.680 --> 01:25:19.001
But apparently, you don't feel the same.

01:25:27.360 --> 01:25:30.045
Okay. We're under it, Q*bert. Now what?

01:25:34.520 --> 01:25:36.420
<i>Well, well, well.</i>

01:25:36.520 --> 01:25:38.060
<i>Look who's here.</i>

01:25:38.160 --> 01:25:40.020
<i>Q*bert the traitor</i>

01:25:40.120 --> 01:25:42.300
<i>and his cheating friends.</i>

01:25:42.400 --> 01:25:44.721
<i>Come to beg for a second chance?</i>

01:25:44.880 --> 01:25:48.327
<i>You're in luck.
The boss wants to meet ya in person.</i>

01:25:48.880 --> 01:25:50.580
<i>So come on up!</i>

01:25:50.680 --> 01:25:55.580
<i>If you defeat him, you save your planet
and destroy our warriors.</i>

01:25:55.680 --> 01:25:57.205
<i>But if you lose...</i>

01:26:08.040 --> 01:26:09.610
See you on the other side.

01:26:23.880 --> 01:26:26.247
You are so powerful, just as I...

01:26:31.880 --> 01:26:35.500
You win!
I'm not gonna fight you anymore, okay?

01:26:35.600 --> 01:26:37.460
I know that you have love in your heart,

01:26:37.560 --> 01:26:40.928
and I know that I could make you happy,
but if you need to kill me,

01:26:41.080 --> 01:26:43.560
then you're just gonna have to go ahead
and kill me.

01:26:46.040 --> 01:26:50.284
At least I can die a happy man
knowing that I found true love.

01:27:24.760 --> 01:27:27.570
And I couldn't even get a handshake
from Serena Williams.

01:27:27.760 --> 01:27:29.125
Well, well, well.

01:27:29.280 --> 01:27:31.169
Didn't think I'd see you again.

01:27:31.320 --> 01:27:35.405
I had to prove to myself and to the world
that I could do this without cheating.

01:27:35.600 --> 01:27:36.761
Wait, you cheated?

01:27:36.920 --> 01:27:38.001
Moving on.

01:27:44.480 --> 01:27:46.687
You gonna introduce me
to your girlfriend?

01:27:47.600 --> 01:27:48.931
Fiancée.

01:28:03.200 --> 01:28:05.500
Where are we, Q*bert?
What is this place?

01:28:05.600 --> 01:28:06.940
I don't know.

01:28:07.040 --> 01:28:08.724
But I'm scared.

01:28:09.840 --> 01:28:11.285
Great.

01:28:19.720 --> 01:28:20.846
What is that noise?

01:28:30.240 --> 01:28:31.969
What the hell was that?

01:28:37.560 --> 01:28:39.460
Donkey Kong.

01:28:39.560 --> 01:28:41.562
The one game you suck at.

01:28:41.720 --> 01:28:42.721
Yeah.

01:28:43.720 --> 01:28:45.245
Mom, up here!

01:28:46.200 --> 01:28:47.565
Matty!

01:28:47.720 --> 01:28:48.846
Mom!

01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:50.650
Where the hell is my mama?

01:28:50.840 --> 01:28:52.524
We're coming for you, honey!

01:28:58.720 --> 01:29:00.006
No.

01:29:18.280 --> 01:29:19.660
There's too many of them!

01:29:19.760 --> 01:29:20.886
This way!

01:29:23.760 --> 01:29:25.603
Only one way to beat this game. Jump!

01:29:27.880 --> 01:29:28.961
Up the ladder! Fast!

01:29:32.080 --> 01:29:33.286
Incoming!

01:29:53.800 --> 01:29:55.165
Q*bert! Look out!

01:29:57.240 --> 01:29:59.083
Q*bert!

01:30:13.320 --> 01:30:15.860
I can't do this. There's no pattern.

01:30:15.960 --> 01:30:18.930
Pretend you're the guy
and you don't wanna die.

01:30:20.920 --> 01:30:22.001
I don't wanna die!

01:30:22.840 --> 01:30:24.490
I couldn't even beat Eddie Plant!

01:30:24.640 --> 01:30:28.486
Eddie Plant's a cheater!
That's why he was so good in New York.

01:30:28.640 --> 01:30:30.688
He used cheat codes.

01:30:31.240 --> 01:30:34.130
<i>He did the same thing to you
when you were kids.</i>

01:30:34.920 --> 01:30:37.207
<i>You know what that means, right?</i>

01:30:40.600 --> 01:30:43.490
I'm the <i>Donkey Kong</i>
champion of the world.

01:30:43.640 --> 01:30:46.371
And the <i>Donkey Kong</i> champion
of the world doesn't need patterns.

01:30:46.640 --> 01:30:47.641
Reset button.

01:31:00.880 --> 01:31:02.211
Freeze, Chewie!

01:31:09.200 --> 01:31:10.201
Brenner!

01:31:16.880 --> 01:31:19.042
Mom, Mom! Q*bert's not dead!

01:31:20.040 --> 01:31:22.008
Help me! Help me!

01:31:22.200 --> 01:31:24.362
Nah, I'm pretty sure he's dead, Matty.

01:31:24.520 --> 01:31:25.521
Mom!

01:31:26.200 --> 01:31:27.980
Please.

01:31:28.080 --> 01:31:29.420
Okay, fine.

01:31:29.520 --> 01:31:30.931
What? No!

01:31:31.080 --> 01:31:32.081
No!

01:31:38.680 --> 01:31:40.409
Violet, get outta there!

01:31:46.720 --> 01:31:47.721
Look out!

01:31:58.040 --> 01:31:59.041
We're trapped!

01:32:04.280 --> 01:32:05.281
Brenner!

01:32:16.800 --> 01:32:18.564
Here, grab onto my mighty hammer.

01:32:21.960 --> 01:32:23.100
You loved saying that.

01:32:23.200 --> 01:32:24.406
Yes, I did.

01:32:27.120 --> 01:32:30.727
Brenner! Whatever you're doing,
please hurry up!

01:32:39.320 --> 01:32:42.290
I've been waitin' to do this since 1982.

01:32:54.800 --> 01:32:56.086
Yeah!

01:32:56.240 --> 01:32:57.810
Yeah! Yes!

01:32:57.960 --> 01:33:00.850
Yeah. Yeah.

01:33:12.520 --> 01:33:14.522
Matty! God!

01:33:15.840 --> 01:33:17.842
- You okay?
- Yeah.

01:33:18.160 --> 01:33:20.003
You were so awesome down there!

01:33:20.640 --> 01:33:23.120
You're my second favorite president.
You know Obama's still my man, right?

01:33:23.240 --> 01:33:24.526
Okay.

01:33:34.520 --> 01:33:35.885
We won!

01:33:36.680 --> 01:33:38.125
No more taxes!

01:33:39.440 --> 01:33:41.169
We did it, baby!

01:33:41.520 --> 01:33:42.885
We did it.

01:33:43.040 --> 01:33:44.166
No.

01:33:44.720 --> 01:33:46.700
No. No!

01:33:46.800 --> 01:33:49.620
Lady Lisa!

01:33:49.720 --> 01:33:51.882
No!

01:34:08.680 --> 01:34:10.860
Eddie, never thought I'd see you again.

01:34:10.960 --> 01:34:14.580
Brenner, I just wanted to say I'm sorry for
cheatin' back in the day when we was kids,

01:34:14.680 --> 01:34:17.060
and for cheatin' again more recently.

01:34:17.160 --> 01:34:18.980
I'm not goin' back to prison
for that, am I?

01:34:19.080 --> 01:34:22.209
No, but you need to admit to Brenner
that he's the best in the world.

01:34:23.080 --> 01:34:24.161
No way.

01:34:24.320 --> 01:34:25.401
Prison.

01:34:29.040 --> 01:34:30.246
Brenner,

01:34:33.080 --> 01:34:34.684
you are the best

01:34:36.040 --> 01:34:37.405
in the world

01:34:38.560 --> 01:34:40.927
at the <i>Donkey Kong.</i>

01:34:41.720 --> 01:34:42.980
That's right. I am.

01:34:43.080 --> 01:34:44.844
Ludlow. What's the matter, buddy?

01:34:45.440 --> 01:34:47.681
I finally had the one thing I wanted

01:34:48.400 --> 01:34:50.402
and now I'm back to being all alone.

01:34:50.680 --> 01:34:53.420
Lady Lisa, she made an appearance.

01:34:53.520 --> 01:34:58.447
And while you guys were out, you know,
savin' the world, you kind of destroyed his.

01:34:59.120 --> 01:35:00.610
That's horrible.

01:35:00.920 --> 01:35:04.288
It's just, how come he gets to stay?
Why are you still here?

01:35:04.560 --> 01:35:06.050
I'm sorry.

01:35:06.200 --> 01:35:07.565
Q*bert's a trophy.

01:35:07.760 --> 01:35:09.444
And I guess we get to keep the trophies.

01:35:10.080 --> 01:35:11.081
Yeah.

01:35:22.600 --> 01:35:24.204
Q*bert, what is it?

01:35:40.000 --> 01:35:43.322
Wait, no one else is weirded out by this?
That was just Q*bert.

01:35:43.480 --> 01:35:45.323
- Mr. President! Please!
- Yes, Renee.

01:35:45.480 --> 01:35:47.562
Mr. President, are we out of danger?

01:35:47.760 --> 01:35:50.161
<i>Yes. In fact, I am pleased to announce</i>

01:35:50.320 --> 01:35:53.802
<i>I have brokered a peace treaty
with the alien invaders.</i>

01:35:56.160 --> 01:35:59.164
<i>This peace is due to, and only due to</i>

01:35:59.320 --> 01:36:01.527
<i>the bravery of the Arcaders,</i>

01:36:01.920 --> 01:36:05.811
<i>who, against all odds,
stepped up and saved us all.</i>

01:36:06.760 --> 01:36:08.060
<i>Eddie Plant,</i>

01:36:08.160 --> 01:36:09.900
<i>Ludlow Lamonsoff,</i>

01:36:10.000 --> 01:36:11.365
<i>Sam Brenner,</i>

01:36:11.520 --> 01:36:13.966
<i>and Lieutenant Colonel Violet Van Patten</i>

01:36:14.440 --> 01:36:15.965
<i>are American heroes.</i>

01:36:16.640 --> 01:36:18.051
<i>World heroes.</i>

01:36:21.200 --> 01:36:24.044
"World hero"?
I guess you're not a nerd anymore.

01:36:24.200 --> 01:36:25.884
You don't want me
to stop being a nerd, ever.

01:36:26.600 --> 01:36:27.860
Why is that?

01:36:27.960 --> 01:36:31.043
'Cause like I said,
nerds are the greatest kissers.

01:36:31.960 --> 01:36:33.962
I'll be the judge of that.

01:37:48.720 --> 01:37:51.580
Hey, kids. Daddy's home.

01:37:51.680 --> 01:37:54.020
- Daddy!
- Daddy! Daddy!

01:37:54.120 --> 01:37:56.140
- Dad! Dad!
- Daddy! Daddy!

01:37:56.240 --> 01:37:58.242
Daddy! Daddy!
