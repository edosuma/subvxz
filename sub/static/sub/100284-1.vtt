WEBVTT

00:19.295 --> 00:21.711
[Christine]  I'm an ordinary sort of person.

00:23.816 --> 00:27.682
It may be hard to believe,
but I've never longed
for the spotlight.

00:27.717 --> 00:29.581
-[camera shutter]
-[journalists] Christine!

00:29.615 --> 00:31.445
Do you have any comments?

00:31.479 --> 00:34.275
-Just a word or two!
-Christine!

00:35.794 --> 00:39.108
[Christine]   But somehow
the spotlight found me.

00:39.142 --> 00:40.419
[journalists shouting]

00:44.630 --> 00:47.702
How can you know
when your story begins?

01:03.442 --> 01:07.446
Like any girl my age,
I'd always dreamt
of meeting Prince Charming.

01:10.691 --> 01:12.693
Then I met John Profumo.

01:18.181 --> 01:20.839
John was never Prince Charming.

01:20.873 --> 01:22.565
I knew that
from the very beginning.

01:22.599 --> 01:23.807
[clears his throat]

01:23.842 --> 01:25.257
[gasps]

01:25.292 --> 01:26.500
Oh, shit!

01:44.242 --> 01:46.692
[Christine]
You're 19 years old.

01:46.727 --> 01:48.832
Innocent, guilty.

01:48.867 --> 01:51.525
-[murmuring]
-Shit!

01:51.559 --> 01:55.667
[Christine]   How can one girl
have the power to bring
a whole world tumbling down?

01:55.701 --> 01:57.358
Oh, Christine.

01:59.429 --> 02:02.329
[journalists] Christine!

02:08.645 --> 02:13.788
[theme song]

02:41.851 --> 02:43.887
Did you take my fags?

02:45.061 --> 02:46.649
Johnny?

02:52.758 --> 02:54.174
Excuse me.

03:03.010 --> 03:04.632
-Hmm.
-Oh!

03:04.667 --> 03:07.359
Sorry, we're closed.

03:07.394 --> 03:09.534
I'm supposed to be
at this toothpaste thing.

03:09.568 --> 03:12.226
Johnny! We need the money.

03:15.298 --> 03:16.644
[moans]

03:18.474 --> 03:20.476
[moans]

03:20.510 --> 03:24.204
Oh, Christ! I swear,
if you ladder my stockings,
I'll kill you.

03:25.515 --> 03:27.586
For fresher cleaner teeth

03:27.621 --> 03:30.762
and minty bright
all-day freshness.

03:30.796 --> 03:32.419
-[chuckles]
-What?

03:32.453 --> 03:33.661
[mocking her]
"Minty bright freshness."

03:33.696 --> 03:37.044
Minty bright all-day freshness

03:37.078 --> 03:39.943
Bloody hell, I've not even
brushed my teeth, you know.

03:39.978 --> 03:41.497
[both laugh]

03:41.531 --> 03:42.843
Oh, I am gonna be so late.

03:42.877 --> 03:44.914
You're always late, woman.

03:44.948 --> 03:47.986
Hmm... Your fault.

03:48.020 --> 03:49.229
[kissing]

04:00.964 --> 04:02.449
Shit.

04:07.005 --> 04:08.662
[Christine]   Men are such fools.

04:08.696 --> 04:11.009
-[wolf whistle]
-But I like them.

04:11.043 --> 04:12.873
And they seem to like me.

04:14.323 --> 04:16.842
If a man finds
a girl attractive,

04:16.877 --> 04:18.810
is she the one to blame?

04:18.844 --> 04:20.674
[man moaning]

04:22.158 --> 04:25.092
[man moaning]

04:25.126 --> 04:29.372
-[Peter] No butter, Mandy.
-I know, I know.

04:29.407 --> 04:30.925
It's Velvet.

04:30.960 --> 04:33.583
Forget Velvet, I'm not
calling you bloody Velvet.

04:35.654 --> 04:37.000
Where'd that bread come from?

04:38.139 --> 04:39.313
The shop.

04:48.874 --> 04:50.704
[Peter murmuring]

04:50.738 --> 04:52.671
Sixteen, eighteen...

04:52.706 --> 04:56.019
Twenty four slices in a loaf.
There should be twenty two left.

04:56.054 --> 04:59.333
Maybe they're cutting down.
Making it smaller,
but charging the same.

04:59.368 --> 05:01.542
Anyway, I had toast
for breakfast.

05:01.577 --> 05:04.925
-This is yesterday's, isn't it?
-No, I had toast, two slices.

05:04.959 --> 05:07.790
Piss off, Mandy!
You can lie to me all you like,
but I'm not eating this--

05:07.824 --> 05:09.723
-I had toast!
-[plate crashing]

05:12.208 --> 05:15.107
Fine. You can starve
for all I care.

05:15.142 --> 05:16.902
The world's about to end anyway.

05:21.838 --> 05:23.357
Miserable old git.

05:23.392 --> 05:25.980
I've had it up to here
with him, Chris.

05:26.015 --> 05:29.639
I mean, today, of all days...

05:29.674 --> 05:31.710
Why? What's today?

05:31.745 --> 05:34.541
-It's my eighteenth!
-Oh, course it is.

05:34.575 --> 05:36.370
Happy birthday, doll.

05:36.405 --> 05:37.958
And look what he gives me!

05:41.444 --> 05:45.414
-Oh! It must be five hundred?
-A thousand.

05:45.448 --> 05:49.625
Would it have killed him
to splash out sixpence extra
on a bit of wrapping paper?

05:49.659 --> 05:53.042
Peter's Peter.
He gave you the Jag last year.

05:53.076 --> 05:54.664
Maybe he's run out of ideas.

05:54.699 --> 05:56.148
He's run out of something.

05:56.183 --> 05:58.530
-[waiter] Sweetheart?
-Full English, please.

05:58.565 --> 06:01.982
-Mand?
-Erm, coffee, please.

06:04.087 --> 06:05.710
[Mandy] Eighteen's not that old.

06:05.744 --> 06:07.643
I just want to have
a bit of fun, you know?

06:07.677 --> 06:10.508
You could have a lot of fun
for a thousand quid.

06:10.542 --> 06:14.822
I was thinking
of having my nose done.
You know, Harley Street job.

06:14.857 --> 06:17.411
The photographers say
it kinks out on this side.

06:18.585 --> 06:20.414
-Looks fine to me.
-Really?

06:20.449 --> 06:22.002
[waitress] There you go, love.

06:24.660 --> 06:27.179
Thanks, doll. I'm skitters.

06:27.214 --> 06:28.802
Keep the change!

06:30.597 --> 06:31.736
[waitress] Thank you.

06:31.770 --> 06:34.635
[both giggle]

06:34.670 --> 06:37.707
[Mandy] Did you go
to your audition
dressed like that?

06:37.742 --> 06:39.606
With a ladder in your stocking

06:39.640 --> 06:41.953
It was for toothpaste,
they weren't looking at my legs.

06:41.987 --> 06:45.508
They always look at your legs.

06:45.543 --> 06:48.649
Christine Margaret Keeler.
You didn't go, did you?

06:48.684 --> 06:51.997
Well... why not?

06:52.032 --> 06:54.897
That was a really
good opportunity, Chris.

06:54.931 --> 06:57.002
[whistles]
Good day to you, ladies.

06:57.037 --> 06:58.728
Oh, bloody hell.

06:58.763 --> 07:00.868
Can't really stop, Lucky,
were in a bit of a rush.

07:00.903 --> 07:03.768
-Going to see somebody, is it?
-It's none of your business.

07:03.802 --> 07:05.873
You think I can't follow you
everywhere you go?

07:05.908 --> 07:07.737
[Mandy] Leave her alone!

07:07.772 --> 07:09.774
You're shacked up
with Edgecombe now,
you little whore!

07:11.189 --> 07:12.742
Yeah, maybe I am!

07:12.777 --> 07:15.607
-Oh!
-You bastard!

07:15.642 --> 07:20.198
[Christine sobs]

07:20.232 --> 07:21.786
See what you make me do!

07:22.959 --> 07:24.513
[Christine sobs]

07:24.547 --> 07:27.550
Bloody hell, Chris,
are you okay?

07:27.585 --> 07:29.828
I'm fine.

07:29.863 --> 07:32.797
-I'm gonna call the police,
this can't keep happening.
-No, no.

07:37.836 --> 07:39.597
Let's go to Stephen's. Come on.

07:43.221 --> 07:48.537
[Christine]   Dr. Stephen Ward.  He was always there to save me.

07:48.571 --> 07:50.815
And there never seemed
a price to pay.

07:51.747 --> 07:52.955
Or so I thought.

07:52.989 --> 07:54.681
Open your mouth, little baby.

07:57.649 --> 07:58.685
Little wider.

08:01.101 --> 08:02.999
Mm... You'll live.

08:03.034 --> 08:05.243
The swelling might
come up in a few hours.

08:05.277 --> 08:07.694
I think I have
some arnica somewhere.

08:07.728 --> 08:09.281
[Mandy] I told her
to go to the police!

08:09.316 --> 08:13.320
It's fine. Lucky'll get over it.

08:13.354 --> 08:15.633
He must have just heard
about me and Johnny.

08:15.667 --> 08:19.775
Chrissie, darling,
on this at least
Lucky and I see eye to eye.

08:19.809 --> 08:23.295
The last thing you need
in your complicated little life

08:23.330 --> 08:25.643
is another low-life
Jamaican boyfriend.

08:25.677 --> 08:29.163
He's not Jamaican!
He's from Antigua.

08:29.198 --> 08:32.546
Johnny can't stick Jamaicans.
And he's nothing like Lucky.

08:33.961 --> 08:35.169
You're just prejudiced.

08:35.204 --> 08:38.172
Oh, no, you know it's not that.

08:38.207 --> 08:40.899
I just... I worry about you,
that's all.

08:43.833 --> 08:46.077
[Christine] Nice arse!

08:46.111 --> 08:47.216
Thank you.

08:47.250 --> 08:48.666
Anyone we know?

08:48.700 --> 08:50.357
Strictly professional,
little baby.

08:50.391 --> 08:52.014
A man has his needs.

08:52.048 --> 08:53.878
[Mandy] I'll pop
to the launderette later.

08:53.912 --> 08:56.156
It's just till
I sort myself out.

08:56.190 --> 08:58.261
[Stephen] You can stay here
as long as you like, darling.

08:58.296 --> 09:00.091
That is if we're spared.

09:00.125 --> 09:03.025
-Spared?
-Khrushchev's missiles.

09:04.336 --> 09:05.648
Cuba, little baby.

09:07.443 --> 09:10.170
-The Russians?
-Oh. Bloody Russians.

09:10.204 --> 09:12.724
-Is ten alright, Mand?
-Help yourself.

09:13.932 --> 09:17.280
But you need to start taking
your modelling seriously,
Christine.

09:17.315 --> 09:18.419
Tell her, Stephen.

09:18.454 --> 09:19.662
[doorbell]

09:19.697 --> 09:21.284
Talking of Russians.

09:25.979 --> 09:29.258
Bloody hell, Eugene,
why don't you just leave
your toothbrush here?

09:29.292 --> 09:31.156
Uhm.

09:31.191 --> 09:34.643
[Christine]   MI5 may have been
watching Captain Ivanov,

09:34.677 --> 09:36.817
but to me he was
just another one
of Stephen's friends.

09:36.852 --> 09:38.957
[camera shutter]

09:38.992 --> 09:41.788
I had no idea what
an extraordinary life
I was leading.

09:41.822 --> 09:45.377
But then, Mr. Profumo
was the extraordinary one.

09:45.412 --> 09:47.034
-[applauses]
-Not me.

09:47.069 --> 09:48.311
Jolly good.

09:48.346 --> 09:50.590
[applauses]

09:52.902 --> 09:53.938
[soldier] Salute.

09:57.942 --> 09:59.633
[soldiers marching]

09:59.668 --> 10:02.463
-The lunch is always very good.
-It had better be.

10:02.498 --> 10:05.018
Terribly sorry, sir.

10:05.052 --> 10:07.986
My mother is a tremendous fan,
Miss Hobson,

10:08.021 --> 10:09.712
she simply
would never forgive me.

10:09.747 --> 10:10.886
Of course.

10:10.920 --> 10:13.164
I go by Mrs. Profumo these days,

10:13.198 --> 10:15.131
but let's not disappoint
your mother.

10:17.513 --> 10:18.445
[soldier] Thank you.

10:18.479 --> 10:19.688
Thank you.

10:23.243 --> 10:26.798
I sometimes think I should
become Prime Minister
just to trump you.

10:26.833 --> 10:29.180
They'd still ask
for my autograph.

10:29.214 --> 10:31.389
-Oh, they'd ask for mine first.
-[laughs]

10:31.423 --> 10:32.701
Mr. Profumo.

10:32.735 --> 10:34.461
-Yes.
-Daily Mirror, sir

10:34.495 --> 10:37.257
Anything to say
about the Cuba situation?

10:37.291 --> 10:40.018
Yes, the Prime Minister
is absolutely right.

10:40.053 --> 10:42.469
We cannot bow to bullying
from the Soviets!

10:42.503 --> 10:44.713
[Profumo] Shall we?

10:44.747 --> 10:47.025
[Christine]   Everyone was
worrying about the bomb,

10:47.060 --> 10:49.683
when they should have been
worrying about me.

10:52.306 --> 10:54.723
I was much more dangerous
than Russia.

10:54.757 --> 10:55.931
[murmuring]

10:55.965 --> 10:57.242
Oh, shit!

11:01.799 --> 11:03.007
Ah, Christine.

11:04.456 --> 11:06.735
[Valerie] A towel, Jack.

11:06.769 --> 11:09.047
Give the poor girl that towel.

11:09.082 --> 11:10.083
Of course.

11:11.878 --> 11:13.845
Right you are.

11:13.880 --> 11:15.019
[chuckles]

11:15.053 --> 11:16.883
[laughing]

11:16.917 --> 11:18.091
Come on!

11:19.989 --> 11:20.956
Did you see them?

11:20.990 --> 11:23.303
[Stephen laughs]

11:23.337 --> 11:27.031
You're an absolute bugger.
You knew I was going for a swim!

11:27.065 --> 11:28.998
Naked as nature intended.

11:29.033 --> 11:30.759
Poor Jack didn't know
where to look.

11:30.793 --> 11:33.278
He knew exactly
where to bloody look!

11:33.313 --> 11:37.317
I suppose it saved me
from introducing you formally
to Mr. Profumo.

11:37.351 --> 11:40.389
Profumo... Is he foreign?

11:40.423 --> 11:43.323
He's the coming man,
little baby.

11:43.357 --> 11:45.394
Might be
our next Prime Minister.

11:45.428 --> 11:46.464
Oh.

11:47.741 --> 11:51.780
His wife's very beautiful.
Even more than at the pictures.

11:51.814 --> 11:53.851
She's stunning...

11:53.885 --> 11:55.818
for a woman of her age.

11:55.853 --> 11:58.062
But she is her age.

11:58.096 --> 12:02.169
And I'd say Mr. Profumo
only has eyes for you.

12:02.204 --> 12:03.308
[giggles]

12:04.620 --> 12:06.380
Oh! [laughs]

12:11.316 --> 12:13.387
[telephone ringing]

12:31.026 --> 12:33.131
Here's the thing.

12:33.166 --> 12:37.446
It's all very well
building Profumo up to tear
the Prime Minister down,

12:37.480 --> 12:40.069
but we don't want
the Tories in at all, do we?

12:40.104 --> 12:43.797
I thought you said
the film star angle
goes down well with the punters.

12:45.247 --> 12:49.009
Like strawberries and cream,
along with the war hero angle.

12:49.044 --> 12:50.562
That's the trouble.

12:50.597 --> 12:52.806
We're making them look
like the Golden Couple.

12:53.945 --> 12:55.602
Fortunately for us,

12:56.983 --> 12:58.812
nobody's perfect, are they?

13:01.608 --> 13:03.575
Would you like me
to have a sniff?

13:03.610 --> 13:09.167
Sniff away, Alan, my lad,
see if anything stinks.

13:09.202 --> 13:12.067
If the Tories are thinking
of getting rid of the PM

13:12.101 --> 13:15.277
and replacing him
with the fifth Baron Profumo,

13:17.175 --> 13:20.040
public has a right to know
the kind of man he is.

13:27.082 --> 13:28.428
[Redmayne] Ah, ah!

13:28.462 --> 13:31.293
So this is what
you've been up to, Jack!

13:31.327 --> 13:34.261
[Profumo] "Stands firm."
What the hell are they implying?

13:34.296 --> 13:37.092
Ah, that you're solid
on this missile nonsense

13:37.126 --> 13:39.266
and you've got the balls
for the top job.

13:39.301 --> 13:42.269
Ha! If the old man could
ever be persuaded to retire.

13:42.304 --> 13:45.307
Yeah. He seems determined
to drop in harness.

13:45.341 --> 13:46.549
We may have to shoot him.

13:46.584 --> 13:47.654
[both laugh]

13:47.688 --> 13:49.552
Well, keep up the good work!

13:51.037 --> 13:53.971
-You look smashing.
-Hmm... Really?

13:54.005 --> 13:56.180
I'd give you a job.

13:56.214 --> 13:58.389
-And the other...
-[laughs]

13:59.666 --> 14:02.048
-Disgusting.
-What did you say?

14:02.082 --> 14:03.946
Hey, Christine.
Don't let it get to you.

14:03.981 --> 14:05.396
Stony-faced old cow
should mind her own
fucking business!

14:05.430 --> 14:08.088
And we should be minding ours.

14:08.123 --> 14:11.091
I've heard a lot worse,
believe me.

14:18.133 --> 14:19.686
-Good luck, doll!
-Hmm.

14:27.763 --> 14:30.524
What about that two pounds
I gave you?

14:30.559 --> 14:33.700
I told-- Mum? Mum, listen!

14:33.734 --> 14:35.322
[background murmur]

14:35.357 --> 14:37.428
I can't give it to you
straight away, but...

14:37.462 --> 14:40.258
[Ivanov] I mean Americans
are putting themselves
all over the world.

14:40.293 --> 14:42.467
-Even in Communist soils!
-[Christine] Just things.

14:42.502 --> 14:47.438
They want me for this advert
on the telly... toothpaste.

14:47.472 --> 14:49.474
[men laughing]

14:49.509 --> 14:51.580
I know things are tight!

14:51.614 --> 14:52.995
[Ivanov] It's your government.

14:53.030 --> 14:54.617
I'm doing everything I can.

14:54.652 --> 14:56.654
[Ivanov] ...being together
with the Americans...

14:56.688 --> 15:00.382
Give him ten bob now
and tell him he can have
the rest next week!

15:00.416 --> 15:03.281
-[hangs up]
-[Ivanov] Cuba is the same
as it's happening in Germany.

15:03.316 --> 15:05.628
That was half a crown at least!

15:05.663 --> 15:07.699
I'll owe you.

15:07.734 --> 15:11.738
God, my mum! It's like
feeding shillings
into the bloody gas meter,

15:11.772 --> 15:13.188
but it never gets warm.

15:13.222 --> 15:17.399
-I think they're handmade shoes.
-What?

15:17.433 --> 15:19.677
Mr. Eddowes.

15:19.711 --> 15:23.129
-[Mandy] Is he one
of Stephen's patients?
-Yeah.

15:23.163 --> 15:27.167
Solicitor or something.
He owns a few restaurants too.

15:27.202 --> 15:29.100
It's clearly a...

15:29.135 --> 15:30.584
[Christine] Be my guest.

15:30.619 --> 15:33.173
But I thought
you'd had it with old blokes.

15:33.208 --> 15:36.452
I like them. I do!

15:36.487 --> 15:38.627
As long as they're presentable.

15:38.661 --> 15:42.079
"Presentable"...
all the way to the bloody bank.

15:42.113 --> 15:43.632
[chuckles]

15:43.666 --> 15:45.082
[Stephen] I couldn't agree more.

15:45.116 --> 15:47.325
Playing missiles
instead of money.

15:47.360 --> 15:49.500
[Stephen] Now you sound
more like them than ever.

15:49.534 --> 15:53.504
[Ivanov] The game
is not important,
it's how you play it.

15:53.538 --> 15:55.747
You're a lucky man, Ward!

15:55.782 --> 15:59.061
My dear Michael,
there is no such thing as luck.

15:59.096 --> 16:01.270
-[laughs]
-Ah!

16:01.305 --> 16:05.585
Only an alertness
to the opportunities
life has to offer you.

16:05.619 --> 16:08.553
[man] ...a Soviet gesture.

16:11.694 --> 16:13.489
[door opening]

16:13.524 --> 16:15.008
[Christine] I'll be off.

16:16.389 --> 16:19.116
You know you can always
bunk with me if you like,
little baby.

16:19.150 --> 16:21.981
Nah, Johnny'll be wondering
where I got to.

16:23.154 --> 16:25.674
You got five bob for the cab?

16:25.708 --> 16:26.744
Help yourself.

16:30.437 --> 16:35.270
At the risk of sounding
like a broken record,

16:35.304 --> 16:38.549
you could do a lot better
for yourself than Johnny.

16:38.583 --> 16:42.173
Thanks... Dad.

16:42.208 --> 16:47.316
Christine, look at you.
Your face is your fortune.

16:47.351 --> 16:49.836
Notting Hill is
not doing you any favors.

16:49.870 --> 16:52.563
At your age,
with your connections--
my connections.

16:52.597 --> 16:55.669
I'm not Mandy.

16:55.704 --> 16:57.430
All's I want is a bit of a laugh

16:57.464 --> 16:59.363
and enough spare
to keep my mum off my back.

16:59.397 --> 17:02.711
Eh. "All". Not "All's".

17:02.745 --> 17:04.333
"All".

17:04.368 --> 17:06.094
Eddowes, though...

17:07.302 --> 17:10.132
Cash to burn
and an eye for a pretty girl.

17:11.720 --> 17:13.342
You know the drill.

17:14.481 --> 17:17.553
You can have your cake
and eat it.

17:17.588 --> 17:19.762
You never eat it.

17:19.797 --> 17:22.351
Just like watching everyone
else stuffing themselves.

17:22.386 --> 17:25.734
[laughs] Crumbs everywhere.

17:25.768 --> 17:28.185
Kinky sod.

17:28.219 --> 17:29.634
Hmm.

17:32.879 --> 17:34.708
I have to fancy them, Stephen.

17:34.743 --> 17:37.159
Either I do, or I don't.

17:37.194 --> 17:40.266
You know if you are really
short of cash you can
always go back to Murray's.

17:40.300 --> 17:41.888
[Christine]
Stick it up your jumper!

17:41.922 --> 17:44.339
-[chuckles]
-[door closes]

17:46.755 --> 17:49.137
[jazz music and club murmur]

18:00.665 --> 18:03.806
["Knock Me a Kiss" playing]

18:12.436 --> 18:16.440
[jazz music playing]

18:35.597 --> 18:40.119
[jazz music playing]

18:45.952 --> 18:49.335
[audience applauding]

18:57.619 --> 18:59.172
Good girl, thank you.

19:05.972 --> 19:08.388
Can I pour you
more Champagne, sir?

19:09.217 --> 19:11.736
That stuff bears as much
resemblance to Champagne

19:11.771 --> 19:13.773
as I do to Rock Hudson.

19:13.807 --> 19:15.188
[Christine giggles]

19:15.223 --> 19:16.707
But yes please.

19:20.607 --> 19:22.471
What are you doing later?

19:23.852 --> 19:25.785
It's already later.

19:25.819 --> 19:27.821
I mean after the club shuts.

19:28.995 --> 19:30.686
Having fun.

19:30.721 --> 19:32.550
Hm, splendid!

19:35.622 --> 19:36.934
And you?

19:43.941 --> 19:47.462
You know, I could introduce you
to a lot more fun.

20:11.693 --> 20:13.212
[door closing]

20:14.661 --> 20:15.766
Murray's, guv.

20:17.595 --> 20:19.632
[Alan] It's a topless cabaret.

20:19.666 --> 20:23.498
One of the dancers
was very friendly
with Mr. Profumo, apparently.

20:23.532 --> 20:26.639
-Have you spoken to her?
-They said she finished there
months ago.

20:26.673 --> 20:29.297
She can't have vanished
into thin air.
Did you get a name?

20:29.331 --> 20:31.057
Christine Keeler.

20:31.091 --> 20:34.336
Christine Keeler.

20:36.890 --> 20:39.617
I want this one, Alan.

20:39.652 --> 20:40.963
You need to find her.

20:42.482 --> 20:43.932
Cherchez le bint.

20:49.800 --> 20:51.733
[door closing]

20:52.699 --> 20:56.669
Stephen's right,
you've got a lovely place
here, Mr. Eddowes.

20:56.703 --> 20:58.429
Michael, please.

20:59.948 --> 21:04.677
I was so delighted that
you accepted my invitation.

21:06.541 --> 21:08.508
I thought perhaps you wouldn't.

21:10.648 --> 21:11.580
Let me.

21:24.697 --> 21:26.837
[Eddowes] That's rather smart.

21:26.871 --> 21:28.321
It was a present.

21:28.356 --> 21:30.323
From an admirer, no doubt.

21:31.635 --> 21:35.742
-Jack Profumo actually.
-Profumo?

21:35.777 --> 21:37.365
The War Minister?

21:38.020 --> 21:40.402
He's something
in government, isn't he?

21:41.714 --> 21:43.716
Something important, anyway.

21:54.727 --> 21:56.142
Christine...

21:56.176 --> 21:59.904
Thank you ever so much
for lunch, Michael.

21:59.939 --> 22:01.596
You're very sweet.

22:06.877 --> 22:08.741
Darby and Joan those two...

22:10.639 --> 22:13.849
Isn't Ward worried
the Russian chap's a spy?

22:13.884 --> 22:15.057
Eugene?

22:16.196 --> 22:18.371
[Christine] Stephen says
it doesn't matter because...

22:18.406 --> 22:21.547
Well, because Wotsit's
keeping an eye on him.

22:21.581 --> 22:23.480
They listen in
on the phones as well.

22:23.514 --> 22:24.929
MI5?

22:26.414 --> 22:27.829
Makes him feel important.

22:29.140 --> 22:30.866
See you later, Michael.

22:37.597 --> 22:38.874
Christine! Hear me.

22:38.909 --> 22:40.738
-Stay away from me!
-No, no, listen.

22:40.773 --> 22:43.569
I just want to apologize
for our misunderstanding.

22:43.603 --> 22:45.053
I wasn't thinking straight.

22:45.087 --> 22:47.158
You're not right
in the bloody head, that's why!

22:47.193 --> 22:48.884
Mr. Eddowes, can you get me
out of here please?

22:48.919 --> 22:50.127
[Eddowes] This really isn't...

22:50.161 --> 22:52.405
Allow me to explain myself.

22:52.440 --> 22:54.234
I don't wanna talk
to you, Lucky!

22:54.269 --> 22:56.616
We're not together anymore.
We're finished!

22:56.651 --> 22:58.791
Listen, Christine, please.
I just want to...

22:58.825 --> 23:00.793
Lucky, all right, you're not
doing yourself any favors.

23:00.827 --> 23:03.140
Edgecombe is no good,
you need to know that.

23:03.174 --> 23:05.418
He sleeps with every girl
he meets.

23:05.453 --> 23:07.696
He's twice the bloke
you'll ever be,
so piss off out my business!

23:07.731 --> 23:09.457
No, listen,
I'm just trying to apologize.

23:09.491 --> 23:12.425
-Drive!
-I'm trying to be helpful,
Christine!

23:12.460 --> 23:13.875
Get off of me, man.

23:21.814 --> 23:23.229
Lucky says it's me.

23:24.541 --> 23:26.439
I drive him crazy.

23:26.474 --> 23:30.029
[Johnny chuckles]
Got that right.

23:30.063 --> 23:31.996
You drive me crazy.

23:34.205 --> 23:35.931
Man's got a screw loose.

23:37.243 --> 23:38.589
Everyone knows that.

23:39.970 --> 23:43.525
I should get a gun
to keep me safe.

23:43.560 --> 23:45.976
-Only thing he understands.
-Hmm.

23:47.287 --> 23:48.806
I'll keep you safe.

23:50.221 --> 23:51.257
Will you?

23:53.293 --> 23:57.125
Every way I know how.

24:05.271 --> 24:07.825
Are you sure
you didn't get that job?

24:07.860 --> 24:10.138
Yeah. [huffs]

24:10.172 --> 24:12.278
They said they weren't hiring,

24:12.312 --> 24:15.557
which is what they always
say before you see
a white guy walk up

24:15.592 --> 24:17.214
and shake their hand.

24:22.046 --> 24:24.014
Do you know anyone
who could get hold of a gun?

24:24.048 --> 24:25.981
[laughs]

24:26.016 --> 24:28.570
You got the wrong man, girl.

24:28.605 --> 24:31.159
John Edgecombe
is a man of peace.

24:31.193 --> 24:35.922
Peace, and music, and love ...

24:41.583 --> 24:43.067
You sure about that?

24:46.070 --> 24:47.624
[gunshot]

24:49.004 --> 24:50.592
[gunshot]

24:54.631 --> 24:57.254
I'm not certain this is
a good idea, Stephen.

24:58.566 --> 25:02.570
You know Mandy,
always keen on a new experience.

25:02.604 --> 25:06.021
No. I meant putting
Arran and Ivanov together.

25:06.056 --> 25:08.610
Perhaps we should leave
politics to the politicians?

25:08.645 --> 25:09.749
[gunshot]

25:13.615 --> 25:15.721
Obviously, you will get rid
of Mandy before lunch.

25:15.755 --> 25:19.241
I wouldn't dream
of bringing her to the house,
Bill, you know that.

25:20.657 --> 25:24.592
Mutually assured destruction.

25:24.626 --> 25:27.215
The world is on the brink
of nuclear war,

25:27.249 --> 25:30.563
and Lord Arran has the ear
of the Prime Minister.

25:32.323 --> 25:33.980
[gunshot]

25:34.015 --> 25:37.743
I can mention your idea
to the PM, Doctor Ward.

25:39.641 --> 25:43.680
[Arran] Though I'm not
quite clear what a Russian
naval  attaché is doing,

25:43.714 --> 25:46.268
attempting to set up
peace talks.

25:48.063 --> 25:50.031
Well, not everyone
in the Kremlin

25:50.065 --> 25:54.311
is as hell bent on war
as Krushchev, my lord.

25:54.345 --> 25:57.383
And my friendship with Eugene

25:57.417 --> 26:01.145
puts me in a rather unique
position, you might say.

26:03.251 --> 26:04.666
[gunshot]

26:04.701 --> 26:07.600
-[man] Bloody hell!
-Oh, bugger.

26:07.635 --> 26:09.809
Careful, miss.

26:09.844 --> 26:11.949
-Sorry.
-I'll take that.

26:11.984 --> 26:14.814
[men laugh]

26:16.920 --> 26:20.406
This Arran didn't take me
seriously, I can tell.

26:20.440 --> 26:24.030
Eugene, Lord Arran
is an English aristocrat.

26:24.065 --> 26:27.378
He's spent a lifetime
perfecting the same expression
for everything,

26:27.413 --> 26:30.623
whether he takes it
seriously or not.

26:30.658 --> 26:33.143
What do you think Eton's for?

26:33.177 --> 26:36.146
You didn't go to Eton,
my friend.

26:36.180 --> 26:38.838
These public schools
that are in fact private...

26:38.873 --> 26:42.083
I went to public school,
just not Eton.

26:42.117 --> 26:47.088
Or Harrow, or Charterhouse,
or Winchester, or Sherborne.

26:47.122 --> 26:50.091
[laughs] Sherborne
is practically
a minor public school...

26:50.125 --> 26:52.714
Ah, good, I've caught you!

26:52.749 --> 26:56.476
Bill's in the bath,
but he's suffering I can tell.
His sacroiliac's out.

26:56.511 --> 26:59.963
If you can spare the time
do pop along, would you?
After supper.

26:59.997 --> 27:03.449
I can always spare you
the time, Lady Astor!

27:04.830 --> 27:08.661
You've met, I think.
Captain Ivanov.

27:08.696 --> 27:12.389
I imagine you already know
Lady Astor was
a celebrated mannequin

27:12.423 --> 27:14.080
before she met her husband.

27:14.115 --> 27:16.842
Well, we all retire
when we marry!

27:16.876 --> 27:19.120
Not from everything, I hope.

27:21.916 --> 27:25.022
Forgive me, Captain,
we're just about
to beat the gong.

27:28.508 --> 27:30.959
You didn't get an invitation
for supper, ah?

27:30.994 --> 27:32.478
[laughs]

27:33.755 --> 27:40.072
I fear my presence reminds
Lady Astor of Bill's
bachelor days.

27:40.106 --> 27:43.489
Beans on toast at the cottage,
old chap! Food of the gods.

27:43.523 --> 27:47.217
Communism, my friend. Communism.

27:49.081 --> 27:50.151
[engine starts]

27:58.297 --> 28:00.713
[Christine]   High society.

28:00.748 --> 28:04.855
Stephen couldn't resist
a toff any more
than he could a pretty face.

28:04.890 --> 28:07.789
He saw himself as so much more
than just a doctor.

28:09.757 --> 28:12.449
And with his finger
in all those pies,

28:12.483 --> 28:16.798
is it any surprise MI5
were beginning to wonder
whose side he was on?

28:22.286 --> 28:26.912
Doctor Ward,
our society osteopath.

28:26.946 --> 28:29.569
The Foreign Office passed it on.

28:29.604 --> 28:32.469
Always knew Ward was
a loose cannon, but really...

28:32.503 --> 28:36.162
He's been on to Lord Arran
trying to set up a peace summit,
here in London.

28:36.197 --> 28:39.131
[Hollis] Seems to think
he can solve the Cuban Crisis.

28:39.165 --> 28:42.134
He's a back doctor
for God's sake!

28:42.168 --> 28:46.034
Clearly he considers himself
something of an emissary
for the moderate Russian view.

28:46.069 --> 28:49.279
Emissary for cloud
ruddy cuckoo land.

28:49.313 --> 28:52.006
[scoffs] Peace!

28:52.040 --> 28:54.905
That is the last thing
Comrade Ivanov's interested in.

28:54.940 --> 28:58.391
Surely Ward sees it,
the man is a threat
to national security.

28:59.530 --> 29:01.774
He's playing Ward
like a Stradivarius.

29:01.809 --> 29:06.296
If only we knew the tune.
You're continuing
to keep an eye?

29:06.330 --> 29:07.987
Certainly am, sir.

29:08.022 --> 29:09.851
Ivanov's always at Wimpole Mews.

29:09.886 --> 29:12.198
And Ward keeps
interesting company.

29:13.579 --> 29:17.307
These popsies of his,
that come and go,

29:17.341 --> 29:19.619
I was wondering
if it would be useful
to have a word with them?

29:19.654 --> 29:22.001
Good God, whatever for?

29:22.036 --> 29:27.006
It's just, well,
they're clearly very close
to both Ward and Ivanov.

29:29.008 --> 29:32.425
And there's started to be
a certain amount of noise
about one of the girls

29:32.460 --> 29:34.634
and the Secretary of State
for War.

29:34.669 --> 29:38.846
Profumo?
Well, we know about that.

29:38.880 --> 29:42.090
It's done and dusted.
Let's leave well alone.

29:42.125 --> 29:45.266
Especially when we can see
exactly what they are.

29:45.300 --> 29:47.889
Window dressing.

29:47.924 --> 29:50.202
Parsley on the plate!

29:50.236 --> 29:53.136
[Hollis] These girls aren't
going to cause any trouble.

29:57.002 --> 29:59.107
Boom, boom, boom.

29:59.142 --> 30:01.385
[chuckles]

30:01.420 --> 30:03.594
Not bad for twenty quid, eh?

30:03.629 --> 30:05.113
Said it was from the war.

30:07.115 --> 30:09.324
-Stop pointing that thing!
-[laughs]

30:09.359 --> 30:12.155
It's not loaded. Yet.

30:13.432 --> 30:16.159
Oh, come on, let's go out!

30:16.193 --> 30:19.645
Can't remember the last time
we went dancing.

30:19.679 --> 30:22.337
Don't you fancy it,
the all-nighters?

30:22.372 --> 30:25.340
Yeah, but not with this.
No, no, come on.

30:26.617 --> 30:30.242
Told you, didn't I?

30:30.276 --> 30:32.347
I'll look after you, darling.

30:45.050 --> 30:46.292
-Ah!
-[screams]

30:46.327 --> 30:47.949
You looking good, no?

30:47.984 --> 30:50.262
You're not so bad yourself.

30:50.296 --> 30:52.298
Best looking girl
in the west end.

30:55.232 --> 30:56.682
-Come on!
-All right.

30:58.166 --> 30:59.616
Oh, flipping 'eck

31:13.492 --> 31:15.701
-Jack.
-Hmm.

31:15.735 --> 31:19.601
You haven't happened
to see this month's
Parliamentary Sketch, have you?

31:19.636 --> 31:21.189
God, no.

31:21.224 --> 31:23.433
Do I look like
a dipsomaniac backbencher?

31:23.467 --> 31:26.298
Perhaps you should take a look.

31:26.332 --> 31:29.715
-Ah.
-You see what they're implying?

31:29.749 --> 31:31.199
It's obtuse enough.

31:33.063 --> 31:35.721
"Who's spilled the beans to MI5?

31:35.755 --> 31:38.689
Because every time
the card playing Russian spy

31:38.724 --> 31:41.209
arrived to admire
the showgirl's curves,

31:41.244 --> 31:45.144
out of the back door slipped
the Honorable Member for X?"

31:45.179 --> 31:47.664
I wouldn't call that obtuse.
It's you and Christine.

31:47.698 --> 31:49.700
Nonsense, Bill. Absolute tosh.

31:49.735 --> 31:51.979
It was all over months ago.

31:53.428 --> 31:54.671
Christine who?

32:01.471 --> 32:04.750
-Bill looks awfully worried.
-He came out of the womb
looking like that.

32:04.784 --> 32:06.200
Just Westminster gossip.

32:06.234 --> 32:09.168
[Profumo]
I'll fill you in after supper.

32:09.203 --> 32:13.517
[dance music playing]

32:19.765 --> 32:24.080
[music continues]

32:29.223 --> 32:32.502
-Whoa!
-[applause]

32:32.536 --> 32:36.506
[cheering and applause]

32:36.540 --> 32:38.163
You know I love you, right?

32:38.197 --> 32:41.649
[music starts again]

32:48.414 --> 32:52.004
Hey, don't turn round,
but Lucky's here.

32:52.039 --> 32:53.074
Don't!

32:55.594 --> 32:59.115
-You scared?
-No.

32:59.149 --> 33:01.117
[Johnny] He's the guy
with the problem.

33:01.151 --> 33:04.120
Screw him! It's a free country.

33:07.226 --> 33:10.505
Hey, cool it. Cool it.

33:11.679 --> 33:14.578
Got plenty of trouble
without you running around
finding it for me.

33:14.613 --> 33:16.063
I don't want trouble!

33:16.097 --> 33:17.581
If he doesn't like it,
he can piss off!

33:17.616 --> 33:18.513
Come on!

33:20.791 --> 33:22.862
[man] Leave it, man,
she's not worth it.

33:22.897 --> 33:24.554
No, man, it's disrespectful.

33:24.588 --> 33:26.176
[people shouting]

33:26.211 --> 33:28.316
-What was that, man?
-Listen, you know me!

33:28.351 --> 33:30.042
[man] Leave it, leave it.

33:30.077 --> 33:32.148
Watch out.

33:32.182 --> 33:35.530
What you trying to do to me?
Rubbing my nose in it.

33:35.565 --> 33:37.153
You know everybody
knows me here!

33:37.187 --> 33:39.258
That's enough,
we don't want any trouble.

33:39.293 --> 33:41.157
-It has nothing to do with you.
-It has everything
to do with me!

33:41.191 --> 33:43.504
-You're not so full of it now.
-Shut your fucking mouth.

33:43.538 --> 33:45.057
-I said leave it!
-What you gonna do?

33:45.092 --> 33:46.576
I swear to you,
I got box your eyes out!

33:46.610 --> 33:47.715
Swear what?

33:49.613 --> 33:51.512
[Johnny] Come on!

33:51.546 --> 33:54.239
-Go on, you nasty little bitch.
-[screams]

33:54.273 --> 33:56.448
-Let me go!
-[Johnny] Leave her!

33:56.482 --> 33:58.277
Leave her alone!

33:58.312 --> 34:00.383
-[Christine] Johnny!
-You try and play bad?

34:00.417 --> 34:02.178
What you gonna do?

34:02.212 --> 34:03.455
No, do it now.

34:03.489 --> 34:05.560
Go on now.
What you got?

34:05.595 --> 34:07.079
-Bring it--
-Ah!

34:07.114 --> 34:08.322
[people screaming]

34:11.497 --> 34:12.843
[groans]

34:16.709 --> 34:18.504
He cut me.

34:18.539 --> 34:20.886
[Lucky] Everybody see,
he cut me!

34:20.920 --> 34:23.716
You'll go to jail you!
You mad bitch!

34:23.751 --> 34:26.167
He going to jail, both of you!

34:26.202 --> 34:28.169
[Lucky] Go on! Run!

34:30.620 --> 34:32.242
[Johnny] Christine!

34:34.175 --> 34:35.832
Christine!

34:41.838 --> 34:44.634
[panting]

34:47.602 --> 34:49.604
-[phone ringing]
-[Peter] Jesus!

34:49.639 --> 34:51.779
-What's that? Mandy!
-What?

34:51.813 --> 34:54.747
-Under the pillow.
-Oh, calm down.

34:54.782 --> 34:56.577
It's only a bit
of Fruit and Nut, in case...

34:56.611 --> 34:59.166
-In case? What "in case"?
-The bomb.

34:59.200 --> 35:01.513
If the warning goes off,
doesn't matter
if it gives me spots, does it?

35:01.547 --> 35:03.894
[phone ringing]

35:03.929 --> 35:06.449
-Marylebone 54643.
-Meshugganah!

35:06.483 --> 35:08.692
It's all kicked off with Lucky!
Get Stephen!

35:08.727 --> 35:12.144
-No, Stephen's at the cottage.
-It's proper trouble, Mandy.

35:12.179 --> 35:13.939
I'm gonna come over!

35:13.973 --> 35:18.461
No, listen, just lie low
for a bit, okay?

35:18.495 --> 35:19.910
Peter's here.

35:19.945 --> 35:21.360
Talk to you tomorrow.

35:21.395 --> 35:22.810
Stephen will be back by then.

35:22.844 --> 35:24.777
-Mand--
-[call ended]

35:24.812 --> 35:26.641
Shit!

35:26.676 --> 35:28.402
[panting]

35:29.817 --> 35:32.751
Christine, what you playing at?
We got to split! Now!

35:32.785 --> 35:34.442
Before the pigs
come get me, come on!

35:34.477 --> 35:36.858
Why'd you have to cut him?

35:42.726 --> 35:47.283
[murmur]

35:48.732 --> 35:53.634
[people chatting]

35:53.668 --> 35:55.808
[door opening]

36:13.757 --> 36:16.691
Oh, little baby,
what is it about you?

36:16.726 --> 36:19.625
Chaos seems to follow
you wherever you go.

36:19.660 --> 36:23.250
-It wasn't me
who pulled a knife.
-No, I know.

36:23.284 --> 36:27.219
But I did hear your knight
in shining armor gave Lucky
a face full of stitches.

36:27.254 --> 36:29.359
Lucky started it.

36:29.394 --> 36:31.810
The police should be after him
just as much as Johnny!

36:31.844 --> 36:36.573
And any good solicitor will make
exactly that case, self-defense.

36:36.608 --> 36:39.956
If Lucky had provoked him,
struck the first blow.

36:39.990 --> 36:41.647
Of course he bloody did!

36:43.891 --> 36:46.238
I never thought Johnny
would pull a stunt like that.

36:47.860 --> 36:49.517
Never thought he had it in him.

36:49.552 --> 36:52.486
Notting Hill, little baby.
What did I say?

36:52.520 --> 36:54.902
I'm not moving back
to Wimpole Mews, Stephen.

36:54.936 --> 36:56.490
Did I even suggest it?

36:56.524 --> 36:59.078
I can't always come
crying to you, can I?

36:59.113 --> 37:01.253
I've got to stand
on my own two feet.

37:04.670 --> 37:07.501
How much does
a good solicitor cost, anyway?

37:09.468 --> 37:12.747
[laughs] Little baby.

37:14.439 --> 37:16.372
Lots and lots of money.

37:22.895 --> 37:25.450
Wiggy's brother's got
a place in Brentford.

37:25.484 --> 37:28.004
I'm not going to Brentford.

37:28.038 --> 37:30.489
Stephen's right,
and Mr. Eddowes.

37:30.524 --> 37:32.526
You have to hand yourself in.

37:32.560 --> 37:33.734
Fuck that.

37:36.012 --> 37:38.497
"Mr. Eddowes."

37:38.532 --> 37:42.294
-That who you're seeing?
-Don't start that again,
checking up on me.

37:42.329 --> 37:44.814
I'm doing this
so we don't have
to cough up for a solicitor.

37:44.848 --> 37:49.025
It's normal to want
to know where you are,
if we're together.

37:49.059 --> 37:49.991
"If."

37:51.441 --> 37:52.546
Is that a question?

37:55.169 --> 37:57.620
Oh, no, no. Hold on!

37:59.587 --> 38:00.795
It's hard.

38:00.830 --> 38:02.832
The walls are closing in,
you know?

38:02.866 --> 38:05.421
Being stuck in here
all day and all night.

38:05.455 --> 38:07.388
Well, you brought that
on yourself.

38:07.423 --> 38:08.838
I was protecting you!

38:10.874 --> 38:12.428
You're my girl, Christine.

38:13.670 --> 38:15.879
Doesn't mean you bloody own me!

38:19.711 --> 38:21.920
[slamming door]

38:21.954 --> 38:25.993
You look particularly lovely
tonight, is this new?

38:26.027 --> 38:29.824
Erm, yes,
a few weeks actually.

38:29.859 --> 38:33.172
It is ridiculous
how this is being reported,

38:33.207 --> 38:36.831
like some glorious
American victory!

38:36.866 --> 38:40.007
-Can I get you another drink?
-Thank you, my dear.

38:42.216 --> 38:44.667
[Ivanov] Can you believe this?
I rather think you have to...

38:44.701 --> 38:47.532
Close your eyes and think
of the free legal advice.

38:47.566 --> 38:49.016
Hm?

38:49.050 --> 38:50.949
Believe me.

38:50.983 --> 38:53.779
Khrushchev has made
some counter-demands
to the Americans.

38:53.814 --> 38:57.196
-Wait and see.
-God, change the bloody record!

38:57.231 --> 39:00.096
[Mandy] America was always going
to come out on top, wasn't it?

39:00.130 --> 39:02.132
More naval and air power,

39:02.167 --> 39:04.376
loads more
intercontinental missiles

39:04.411 --> 39:08.035
[laughing] Mandy is the expert.
We should all listen to her!

39:08.069 --> 39:09.933
I can read the paper.

39:09.968 --> 39:12.488
Russia's got the ground troops
but that doesn't matter anymore.

39:12.522 --> 39:14.731
"The theatre of war
has shifted."

39:14.766 --> 39:18.079
[Ivanov] Of course
ground troops matter!

39:19.253 --> 39:22.670
Ask the Germans
if ground troops matter.

39:22.705 --> 39:27.054
Mr. Profumo would be able
to fill us in, perhaps.

39:27.088 --> 39:30.816
I'm not sure if I want
to know how close we came
to being blown to kingdom come,

39:30.851 --> 39:32.887
thank you very much.

39:32.922 --> 39:35.994
-You know Profumo?
-Not as well as Christine,
by the look of it.

39:37.167 --> 39:38.824
[laughs]

39:38.859 --> 39:42.656
Beautiful place, Cliveden.
Very English. Typical.

39:43.864 --> 39:45.590
And at the Spring Cottage,

39:45.624 --> 39:48.178
Stephen is the host
with the most.

39:48.213 --> 39:49.732
Cheers to that!

39:49.766 --> 39:51.872
-[laugh]
-Nah zda-rovh-yeh.

39:51.906 --> 39:54.115
-[Ivanov] Cheers.
-[Stephen] Cheers.

40:03.297 --> 40:04.678
Your turn.

40:07.025 --> 40:08.923
[girls laughing]

40:08.958 --> 40:10.442
Stop it!

40:10.477 --> 40:12.582
Right, I think
it's time for a race!

40:12.617 --> 40:14.826
-Girls against boys!
-No. Piggy back race.

40:14.860 --> 40:17.656
-Girls on boys' shoulders.
-[Ivanov] Oh, my goodness.

40:17.691 --> 40:20.590
No, no. Let's do
Russia against England!

40:20.625 --> 40:23.628
Yes, if you insist!
Over here, young lady.
Your country needs you.

40:23.662 --> 40:25.699
Oh!

40:25.733 --> 40:27.666
[screams] No, don't tickle me!

40:27.701 --> 40:30.462
[screaming and laughing]

40:30.497 --> 40:33.223
Honestly, they're like children
sometimes, aren't they?

40:33.258 --> 40:35.640
[Stephen]
On your starting marks, please.

40:35.674 --> 40:36.882
Wait, wait.

40:36.917 --> 40:39.057
Not exactly like children.

40:39.091 --> 40:43.061
And ready steady go!

40:43.095 --> 40:44.614
Oh!

40:44.649 --> 40:46.513
Yes!

40:46.547 --> 40:47.824
Oh, no!

40:47.859 --> 40:48.929
[screaming]

40:48.963 --> 40:51.897
Yeah! England won!

40:51.932 --> 40:54.693
-[laughing]
-Fantastic.

40:58.870 --> 41:00.699
[laughs]

41:00.734 --> 41:03.702
Are you sure
we haven't met before?

41:03.737 --> 41:05.808
You look so awfully familiar.

41:09.190 --> 41:10.640
[Christine laughs]

41:13.816 --> 41:15.334
[screaming]

41:15.369 --> 41:17.820
[Christine screams and laughs]

41:22.307 --> 41:24.620
I've never been anywhere
like this before.

41:24.654 --> 41:25.966
It's charming, isn't it?

41:29.245 --> 41:31.005
Bloody hell.

41:32.351 --> 41:34.492
-There's a lot to dust!
-[laughs]

41:36.563 --> 41:38.288
It's like being in a fairy tale.

41:39.635 --> 41:40.739
Hmm.

41:44.156 --> 41:46.227
Murray's!

41:46.262 --> 41:48.057
Murray's club,
with the feathers.

41:48.091 --> 41:51.681
Oh, yeah, that's me!

41:51.716 --> 41:53.027
Did we have a drink?

41:55.305 --> 41:59.206
Sorry, I have drinks
with lots of gentlemen.

42:22.919 --> 42:25.577
-[Ivanov] Ha, here you are!
-Ah.

42:25.612 --> 42:27.752
[laughing] Another race.

42:27.786 --> 42:29.823
Best out of three. I insist!

42:29.857 --> 42:32.032
-Come on!
-All right.

42:32.066 --> 42:34.862
[Ivanov] National honor
must be satisfied.

42:34.897 --> 42:35.932
[all laugh]

42:35.967 --> 42:38.866
-Ah! Ah!
-No! No!

42:38.901 --> 42:41.662
Let's go!

42:41.697 --> 42:43.043
[Christine] Stop it!

42:48.255 --> 42:49.912
[Christine sighs]

42:54.330 --> 42:56.643
Mr. Eddowes says
you corrupted me.

42:57.644 --> 43:01.061
I hope you've told him
I was very late
to that party, darling.

43:01.095 --> 43:02.614
Piss off.

43:06.653 --> 43:08.240
Have you ever been in love?

43:11.002 --> 43:13.142
Twenty times a day,
little baby, you know me.

43:15.040 --> 43:17.249
Why have we never done it,
do you think?

43:18.423 --> 43:19.735
You shagged Mandy.

43:21.253 --> 43:23.462
Are you frightened of me,
Stephen?

43:23.497 --> 43:26.327
What are you scared of?

43:26.362 --> 43:28.744
-[Christine laughs]
-Yes, thank you.

43:34.853 --> 43:37.166
I swear, when I'm sat
in Mr. Eddowes car,

43:37.200 --> 43:41.826
it's like
I'm twelve again, thirteen,

43:43.759 --> 43:47.210
all those dads
used to touch me up
when I babysat their kids.

43:48.246 --> 43:50.973
Some wrinkly old cock.

43:51.939 --> 43:53.734
[Mandy] You don't have to look!

43:54.252 --> 43:57.945
-[phone ringing]
-[laughs]

43:57.980 --> 44:00.154
Well, you don't! Why would you?

44:00.189 --> 44:02.329
What? Ever?

44:02.363 --> 44:05.850
There you have it,
that is why Mandy has
a mink coat and a Jaguar.

44:05.884 --> 44:09.923
And will have a diamond ring
and a flat in Mayfair
by the time she's twenty one.

44:09.957 --> 44:13.167
Last of the great romantics,
our Mand.

44:13.202 --> 44:14.444
[laughs]

44:14.479 --> 44:16.170
[Mandy] Peter's dead.

44:18.897 --> 44:20.692
He's had a heart attack.

44:20.727 --> 44:22.142
[laughs]

44:22.176 --> 44:23.937
It's not a joke!

44:25.904 --> 44:27.941
They found him in his car.

44:29.252 --> 44:30.909
He's dropped dead!

44:30.944 --> 44:34.361
[sobbing] I was foul to him
the last time I saw him!

44:34.395 --> 44:37.295
I never knew,
and now I'll never
be able to say sorry.

44:37.329 --> 44:40.712
-Shhh.
-I told him he had bad breath.

44:40.747 --> 44:43.542
[crying] I didn't mean it!

44:43.577 --> 44:46.131
-I didn't!
-[Stephen] Little baby.

44:46.856 --> 44:48.893
[Mandy crying]

44:58.592 --> 45:03.424
Hey, err--I'm sorry
about before, doll.

45:05.530 --> 45:06.911
Johnny?

45:17.991 --> 45:21.201
[music playing]

45:23.893 --> 45:27.207
Hey, Christine,
how's it hanging beautiful?

45:27.241 --> 45:30.003
-We have mellor opium.
-Darrell, have you seen Johnny?

45:30.037 --> 45:32.177
He may be around here somewhere.

45:32.937 --> 45:34.455
[woman laughing]

45:39.806 --> 45:42.498
What the hell are you doing
with my boyfriend, you bitch?

45:42.532 --> 45:43.948
He's not your boyfriend.

45:43.982 --> 45:45.777
He bloody is!

45:45.812 --> 45:47.572
Look at you,
he must be desperate.

45:48.918 --> 45:51.472
Hey! No, come on. Come on.
Cool it, Christine!

45:51.507 --> 45:53.854
You can't keep it
in your trousers
for one bloody night?

45:53.889 --> 45:55.925
Why should I?
You off putting it
around the West End.

45:55.960 --> 45:58.341
For you! You're the one
who cut Lucky Gordon.

45:58.376 --> 46:00.309
Who wanted the gun, Christine?

46:00.343 --> 46:02.587
-I got coppers asking
everywhere looking for me.
-Fuck off!

46:02.621 --> 46:04.485
I've got the law
all over me because of you!

46:04.520 --> 46:07.799
Screw the little
scrubber's brains out,
I don't give a toss.

46:07.834 --> 46:09.594
And if you think I'm gonna
stand up for you in court

46:09.628 --> 46:11.630
or get a solicitor for you
John Edgecombe,

46:11.665 --> 46:13.460
you've got another
fucking thing coming!

46:13.494 --> 46:14.633
Get out of my way!

46:14.668 --> 46:16.221
[people] Oh!

46:28.199 --> 46:29.269
Darling.

46:32.099 --> 46:33.238
Sexy.

46:35.862 --> 46:38.071
These floors are freezing.

46:38.105 --> 46:41.488
There's a Rembrandt
in the study, but they're
too mean to heat the house.

46:41.522 --> 46:45.009
When you said party,
I thought you meant party party.

46:45.043 --> 46:46.527
Are you not in the mood?

46:46.562 --> 46:48.115
Thank you.

46:48.598 --> 46:52.223
As my mother used to say,
"If you're bored,
you're boring."

46:53.362 --> 46:55.122
God, if people knew...

46:56.089 --> 47:01.025
When I left home,
I had this idea in my head
about London's society,

47:01.059 --> 47:02.474
whatever it's called.

47:03.406 --> 47:05.546
Like everyone posh was better.

47:05.581 --> 47:08.135
Sex is the great equalizer,
little baby.

47:08.170 --> 47:11.104
You always say that,
but no-one's doing this
in Wraysbury.

47:11.138 --> 47:13.175
Two people,
lights out, ten minutes.

47:13.209 --> 47:15.936
[people moaning]

47:17.662 --> 47:20.078
Agh! I should write
a bloody book.

47:20.113 --> 47:23.910
Christine, dear,
who's the Prime Minister?

47:25.187 --> 47:26.326
Why, is he here?

47:26.360 --> 47:28.431
No. I mean, what is his name?

47:28.466 --> 47:30.675
If you're going to be a writer.

47:30.709 --> 47:32.919
Our good old PM.

47:34.127 --> 47:36.370
Oh, I'm not stupid, Stephen!

47:36.405 --> 47:38.925
I know you're not,
but you are
deliciously ignorant.

47:38.959 --> 47:40.892
Why are you being so horrible?

47:42.549 --> 47:43.688
Hey...

47:44.965 --> 47:48.106
Little baby. Huh?

47:50.453 --> 47:53.905
[sobs] Can I stay
with you for a bit?

47:55.113 --> 47:56.666
I'd be delighted.

47:57.495 --> 48:02.603
[women and men moaning]

48:02.638 --> 48:04.226
[both laugh]

48:04.260 --> 48:08.023
[Stephen] Time for cocoa
and pajamas, I think.

48:28.526 --> 48:31.046
You couldn't lend me
a fiver, could you?

48:33.117 --> 48:36.016
I've got my mum breathing
down my neck about her rates.

48:50.203 --> 48:52.101
Need to cash a cheque.

48:56.036 --> 49:00.627
Must dash, Maharajah
with a frozen shoulder.

49:01.766 --> 49:04.389
Help yourself to whatever
there is, little baby.

49:05.252 --> 49:06.529
Not much, I'm afraid.

49:09.049 --> 49:10.948
I was really
in love with Johnny.

49:14.123 --> 49:16.436
Oh, little baby.

49:19.301 --> 49:20.750
You always are.

49:22.649 --> 49:25.031
Until the next one, huh?

49:30.829 --> 49:33.073
No one understands you
like I do,

49:34.661 --> 49:36.007
that's the thing.

49:37.526 --> 49:38.803
We're twins.

49:42.738 --> 49:48.123
-[door opening and closing]
-No, were bloody not, Stephen.

50:34.203 --> 50:35.860
May I telephone you?

50:38.276 --> 50:41.797
I'm in the book.
Stephen's number.

51:03.474 --> 51:06.649
-The new suit?
-Yes, what do you think?

51:09.411 --> 51:11.758
-Very dashing.
-Yeah.

51:11.792 --> 51:15.244
Though do ask your tailor
if it's necessary to cut
your trousers so tight

51:15.279 --> 51:17.246
the world can see your penis?

51:17.281 --> 51:18.799
[laughs] All right.

51:18.834 --> 51:20.939
"It pays to advertise,"
isn't that what they say?

51:20.974 --> 51:22.769
Depends on what you're selling.

51:22.803 --> 51:24.564
[laughs]

51:26.600 --> 51:30.846
Don't you think
a prospective leader
had better shut up shop?

51:30.880 --> 51:33.642
Particularly
if he's playing happy families.

51:34.574 --> 51:36.783
Well, you never know.

51:36.817 --> 51:39.717
After Macmillan the country
might be rather grateful

51:39.751 --> 51:42.271
for a Prime Minister
with a working todger.

51:42.306 --> 51:43.928
[laughs]

51:43.962 --> 51:46.896
If you have a fault, darling,
it is over-confidence.

51:47.759 --> 51:49.485
And don't say "todger", Jack.

51:49.520 --> 51:52.419
Not if you ever want
to fuck me again.

51:52.454 --> 51:54.214
Oh, but I do...

52:19.308 --> 52:20.516
[Mandy] Laddie died.

52:24.486 --> 52:25.590
[sobs]

52:25.625 --> 52:27.489
It's from my sister.

52:29.215 --> 52:30.526
My pony...

52:33.702 --> 52:36.636
he was hit by a car
the same day Peter passed.

52:36.670 --> 52:38.603
Isn't that strange?

52:40.640 --> 52:44.609
I saved every penny I had
to pay for Laddie.

52:48.303 --> 52:50.891
When he was twelve
he was my whole world!

52:53.377 --> 52:55.448
-You'll get over it.
-[car approaching]

52:55.482 --> 52:57.760
-I know I will.
But I feel really shitty now!
-[car door opening]

52:57.795 --> 52:59.417
[knocking on the door]

52:59.452 --> 53:01.937
-[Johnny] Christine!
-Shit! It's Johnny.

53:01.971 --> 53:04.698
-I know you're in there.
-[knocking on the door]

53:04.733 --> 53:07.632
Get your arse down here!

53:07.667 --> 53:09.634
I got the law all over me
'cos of Lucky.

53:09.669 --> 53:12.292
-Tell him I'm not here!
-Well, where are you?

53:12.327 --> 53:14.950
-Make it up.
Say I'm at the hairdressers.
-[Johnny] Christine!

53:14.984 --> 53:16.779
I'll not be a sacrifice!

53:16.814 --> 53:19.955
What?
Any black stud do for you?

53:19.989 --> 53:22.302
You not be messing
with me no more!

53:22.337 --> 53:24.373
She's not here,
she's gone to the hairdresser!

53:24.408 --> 53:26.651
Bullshit! Christine!

53:26.686 --> 53:29.758
I've got a taxi waiting for me,
it's costing me money!

53:29.792 --> 53:31.691
Christine!

53:32.623 --> 53:34.487
-Come on!
-There it is!

53:34.521 --> 53:37.041
-Now you can piss off!
-What you playing at?

53:37.075 --> 53:39.699
-I'm coming for you!
-[Christine] Big man!

53:39.733 --> 53:41.632
You're winding him up!

53:41.666 --> 53:43.634
Go back to your little
spacky-faced bitch
at the shebeen!

53:43.668 --> 53:45.532
She doesn't even know
what it feels like
to have a real man!

53:46.706 --> 53:48.363
[screaming]

53:48.397 --> 53:49.571
[gunshots]

53:50.537 --> 53:52.436
[screaming]

54:04.793 --> 54:07.623
Stephen, Johnny
is trying to kill us.
You need to come quick!

54:11.109 --> 54:12.904
Drive now, drive!

54:13.629 --> 54:14.837
Yes, now!

54:28.989 --> 54:30.853
[Alan] And can I
quote you on that?

54:30.888 --> 54:33.649
-Mandy...
-Rice-Davis, with a hyphen.

54:34.650 --> 54:37.757
Christine's the model
and I'm an actress...

54:38.447 --> 54:39.931
-Christine?
-Keeler.

54:39.966 --> 54:41.899
K-E-E-L-E-R.

54:44.453 --> 54:47.939
You got the hyphen for me? Uh?

54:50.183 --> 54:51.771
[speaking in Russian]

54:54.567 --> 54:58.433
John Edgecombe,
I'm arresting you on suspicion
of attempted murder--

54:58.467 --> 55:01.401
-I didn't do anything!
-Shut it! I don't want to hear
any more from you!

55:01.436 --> 55:04.646
Get in the car, fucking coon!

55:11.549 --> 55:13.862
-Thanks for your time, Mr. Ward.
-Thank you so much Sergeant.

55:17.555 --> 55:20.489
Well, little baby,
I did warn you.

55:20.524 --> 55:23.768
The poo-poo has well
and truly hit the propeller.

55:26.564 --> 55:27.669
Come on.

55:30.672 --> 55:32.881
[Christine]
I am not a bad person.

55:33.744 --> 55:37.782
I am young,
and I like to have fun.

55:38.749 --> 55:42.131
And like any girl my age
I have made mistakes.

55:50.899 --> 55:54.903
Yes, Mr. Profumo
was keeping a secret.

55:56.042 --> 55:57.388
We both were.

55:57.940 --> 55:59.701
But we weren't the only ones.

56:00.943 --> 56:03.221
And believe me,
the secrets that surrounded us

56:03.256 --> 56:05.810
let to a far more
than a few harmless lies.

56:08.606 --> 56:10.436
-It's true.
-[telephone ringing]

56:10.470 --> 56:12.679
Terrible crimes
have being committed.

56:13.784 --> 56:15.233
But not by me.

56:15.268 --> 56:16.752
[telephone ringing]

56:16.787 --> 56:17.891
Yes, sir.

56:19.755 --> 56:23.656
Yes, looks like the girls
could be a problem
after all, sir.

56:30.870 --> 56:31.905
Christine!

56:33.838 --> 56:35.219
Christine Keeler?

56:36.669 --> 56:39.119
-Who says so?
-That's not a face anyone's
gonna forget in a hurry!

56:40.051 --> 56:43.986
We would love to hear
your story, Christine,
when you're ready.

56:45.194 --> 56:47.783
The story behind the story.

56:48.301 --> 56:53.168
We'll pay you good money for it,
photos as well. Double bubble.

56:59.208 --> 57:00.555
Think about it!

57:01.970 --> 57:04.075
All right. I will.

57:06.802 --> 57:09.840
[Christine]  I didn't know it,
but I still had a hell
of a lot to learn.

57:11.186 --> 57:14.189
I was naive, I can see that now.

57:15.224 --> 57:19.056
But so was he.
And he was a man of the world.

57:25.614 --> 57:26.788
Hello.

57:27.305 --> 57:29.169
So you found me
in the book then?

57:30.032 --> 57:31.689
Don't you look ravishing?

57:32.690 --> 57:33.829
Thank you.

57:38.972 --> 57:42.873
My carriage awaits
if you fancy a spin.

57:45.013 --> 57:46.877
Why don't you come in first?
John.

57:50.156 --> 57:53.470
Call me Jack. All my friends do.

57:54.988 --> 57:56.024
Jack.

57:57.474 --> 58:01.892
I wasn't expecting happily
ever after. Just a bit of fun.

58:02.996 --> 58:07.760
But what started as harmless fun  has sown the seeds of scandal.

58:07.794 --> 58:11.764
The most serious scandal
this country has ever faced.

58:12.661 --> 58:17.355
[mob shouting]

58:17.390 --> 58:21.912
[shouting]

58:23.879 --> 58:29.851
[mob shouting]

58:30.955 --> 58:31.991
[screaming]
