‐(door opens)
‐Evie: All righty!

00:20.812 --> 00:22.773
Who's ready for
party makeovers?

00:22.773 --> 00:25.317
‐I guess I am.
(nervous laugh)
‐Sure?

00:25.317 --> 00:27.611
‐I don't think I‐‐
‐That's the attitude!

00:27.611 --> 00:31.031
I've concocted an amazing
beauty mineral base.

00:31.031 --> 00:32.115
Who wants a "basial"?

00:33.784 --> 00:34.868
P.S., I made that up.

00:34.868 --> 00:36.620
Whoa, never would have
guessed that.

00:36.620 --> 00:37.996
What does it matter?

00:37.996 --> 00:40.123
I wasn't even chosen as
the Q. N. L. B.

00:40.123 --> 00:41.333
Mal: Is that a good thing?

00:41.333 --> 00:44.294
'Cause that acronym
just doesn't sound good.

00:44.294 --> 00:48.090
It's Queen of the
Neon Lights Ball, duhzies.

00:48.090 --> 00:51.260
And I. Did not. Win! Ugh.

00:51.260 --> 00:55.097
Oh, Freddie, did you
just ask who did win?

00:55.097 --> 00:56.515
Uh, no.

00:56.515 --> 00:58.225
It was me.
I won.

00:58.225 --> 01:00.102
I'm the Q. N. L. B.

01:00.102 --> 01:04.022
Oh, Mal, did you just ask
where I'm going to
put the crown?

01:04.022 --> 01:05.524
‐(chuckles)
‐Evie: I don't know where.

01:05.524 --> 01:08.151
I'm running out of room
for all my crowns.

01:08.151 --> 01:10.237
Ugh! Ugh!

01:10.237 --> 01:11.989
(laughs) Is that
Ruby's hair?

01:11.989 --> 01:16.493
No. It's the other girl
with a 100 foot ponytail.

01:16.493 --> 01:20.163
I'm stress brushing.
Stress brushing helps me
deal with losing.

01:20.163 --> 01:23.166
Well, then you better
keep brushing,
because I am on fire!

01:23.166 --> 01:27.129
Carbon dioxide, water vapor,
oxygen, and nitrogen
ignited up in here!

01:27.129 --> 01:29.172
‐Ugh!
‐Evie: Okay, Freddie,

01:29.172 --> 01:30.841
for your makeover,
I'm thinking

01:30.841 --> 01:35.137
a little less voodoo,
and a little more new do.

01:35.137 --> 01:36.346
Freddie: That's funny,

01:36.346 --> 01:38.807
'cause for my makeover,
I'm thinking a little

01:38.807 --> 01:40.642
leave me exactly
the way I am.

01:40.642 --> 01:42.060
No probs.

01:42.060 --> 01:43.603
Audrey, for your makeover,

01:43.603 --> 01:46.315
I'm thinking about some
apple‐red lipstick

01:46.315 --> 01:48.692
and some wicked
cheshire cat‐eyes!

01:48.692 --> 01:50.444
The only makeover
I'm interested in

01:50.444 --> 01:53.322
is the one where
I'm made over from being
the one who lost the crown

01:53.322 --> 01:54.865
to the one who won!

01:54.865 --> 01:58.118
Oh, I forgot to
bring that one. Sorry.

01:58.118 --> 02:01.997
Mal, for your makeover,
I wanna see what you
look like in purple.

02:01.997 --> 02:04.791
Um, I think we know
the answer to that.

02:04.791 --> 02:06.251
Evie:
Oh, that's not purple.

02:06.251 --> 02:07.502
That's aubergine.

02:07.502 --> 02:09.713
You know, I always
thought of it
more as an eggplant.

02:09.713 --> 02:11.340
What is happening here?

02:11.340 --> 02:12.424
I know, right?

02:12.424 --> 02:14.384
It's clearly more of
an amethyst.

02:14.384 --> 02:15.636
Jane: Guys,

02:15.636 --> 02:17.304
my mascot uniform is gone!

02:18.305 --> 02:20.349
Why are you looking at me?

02:20.349 --> 02:21.725
Because your bracelet
was in my room.

02:21.725 --> 02:24.478
‐What?
‐You must have dropped it
when you stole my uniform.

02:24.478 --> 02:26.271
I don't know why
my bracelet was there,

02:26.271 --> 02:28.607
but I definitely
didn't take your uniform.

02:28.607 --> 02:30.317
Maybe you spelled it away.

02:30.317 --> 02:31.818
Why would I do that?

02:31.818 --> 02:34.071
Maybe you thought it wasn't
fashion forward or something.

02:34.071 --> 02:35.447
That sounds like
something I would do.

02:35.447 --> 02:36.782
But I didn't.

02:36.782 --> 02:39.409
Promzies. Besides,
I couldn't have.

02:39.409 --> 02:41.495
I was too busy
winning my crown.

02:41.495 --> 02:43.330
Did you guys know
I won a crown?

02:43.330 --> 02:45.415
'Cause I did.
I won the crown.

02:45.415 --> 02:46.500
Ugh!

02:46.500 --> 02:48.001
Trust me,
if I spelled away

02:48.001 --> 02:51.004
every single non‐fashion forward
item I saw every day,

02:51.004 --> 02:52.297
there'd be no clothes
in Auradon.

02:52.297 --> 02:54.007
Ouch.

02:54.007 --> 02:56.468
So, you're saying you
don't like the way we dress?

02:56.468 --> 02:58.053
No, that's not
what I'm saying!

02:58.053 --> 03:01.431
What I'm saying is
I did not take the uniform.

03:01.431 --> 03:04.309
Seriously. Jane, I'm sure
it will show up soon.

03:05.352 --> 03:06.770
I guess you're right.

03:06.770 --> 03:08.772
Yeah. This is Auradon.

03:08.772 --> 03:11.233
It's not like there's some
thief in a cloaked glove

03:11.233 --> 03:12.609
running around
stealing things.

03:12.609 --> 03:14.611
