01:26.082 --> 01:30.417
Ooh, the new issue
of Smothering Mother Magazine.

01:30.474 --> 01:31.563
Hmm....

01:31.927 --> 01:35.568
"Are Bees Building Hives
in your Diaper Genie?

01:35.908 --> 01:38.650
The Deadly Truth about Oxygen."

01:39.526 --> 01:42.772
Is your Baby a Suckaholic?

01:42.773 --> 01:47.033
Experts see new links
between pacifier overuse and...

01:47.701 --> 01:50.097
...low achievement.

01:56.405 --> 01:59.588
Maggie, honey, this
is for your own good.

01:59.595 --> 02:01.100
Growing up means giving up

02:01.104 --> 02:03.411
everything that makes you happy.

02:03.411 --> 02:07.010
It's true. I've given up
everything but raisins.

02:07.010 --> 02:08.892
And the doctor says
they're killing me.

02:08.908 --> 02:11.862
Sweet, plump coffin nails
is what they are.

02:35.327 --> 02:38.742
Maggie, I'm sorry
you miss your pacifier.

02:38.748 --> 02:40.683
But when a mother
makes a decision,

02:40.688 --> 02:42.980
she has to stick by it.

02:45.185 --> 02:47.731
Okay, okay,
you can have it back!

03:03.556 --> 03:06.252
I can't believe you
listened to this magazine.

03:06.255 --> 03:08.281
It's a Larry Flynt publication!

03:08.285 --> 03:10.630
Lisa, stop reading mastheads.

03:10.638 --> 03:12.203
I can't. I won't!

03:15.996 --> 03:18.570
Where's your father
with those pacifiers?

03:21.005 --> 03:22.913
I couldn't find Maggie's brand,

03:22.918 --> 03:24.921
but I got every other
kind I could find.

03:24.968 --> 03:27.060
How about Syntho-Nip?

03:27.307 --> 03:28.280
Kiddy Cork?

03:28.565 --> 03:29.551
Thumbstitute?

03:29.825 --> 03:30.850
AccuTeat?

03:31.186 --> 03:32.451
Bink 182?

03:33.817 --> 03:35.071
Want to suck
on the receipt?

03:41.138 --> 03:42.410
Make her stop!

03:42.475 --> 03:43.740
You make her stop!

03:43.745 --> 03:45.633
- I've had her all day!
- I can't take it anymore!

03:45.638 --> 03:46.411
Larry Flynt?

03:46.416 --> 03:48.453
Larry Flynt? Larry Flynt?

03:48.457 --> 03:49.613
Larry Flynt,

03:49.616 --> 03:51.971
Larry Flynt, Larry Flynt?!

03:59.217 --> 04:01.060
Good work, boy.

04:01.065 --> 04:03.683
Just for that, we're going
to treat your heart murmur,

04:03.695 --> 04:06.191
not just "see how it goes".

04:15.005 --> 04:17.202
Oh, stupid baby.

04:17.348 --> 04:20.519
Growing her brain on my dime.

04:23.025 --> 04:25.143
Are you counting sheep
all night long?

04:38.286 --> 04:39.230
Hm-hmm

04:39.895 --> 04:41.710
He needs help!

04:41.726 --> 04:44.110
Help from a drug!

04:44.128 --> 04:46.242
That help is here. Meet Nappien.

04:52.288 --> 04:53.940
Nappien activates your brain's

04:53.948 --> 04:55.433
napping centers, and attacks

04:55.435 --> 04:56.772
your body's awake-agens.

04:56.775 --> 04:58.643
And unlike Sleepia, it won't cause

04:58.645 --> 05:00.761
foot fattening or elbow stink.

05:02.178 --> 05:02.963
Ooh!

05:04.626 --> 05:07.592
Okay, Nappien, do your stuff.

05:10.637 --> 05:12.043
Hmm, it's not working.

05:12.626 --> 05:15.150
You lousy,worthless piece of...

05:22.548 --> 05:23.413
Woha.

05:23.427 --> 05:25.700
What a wonderful night's sleep.

05:25.705 --> 05:28.812
Thank you, methasorbizone tartrate,

05:28.816 --> 05:31.160
also known as Nappien.

05:32.385 --> 05:33.962
Last night, someone ate all

05:33.967 --> 05:35.423
the food in our fridge.

05:35.428 --> 05:36.991
Maybe it was the same person

05:36.998 --> 05:38.243
who tied each of the dog's

05:38.246 --> 05:40.140
feet to a toy car.

05:43.535 --> 05:46.571
And someone used our videotapes as dominoes.

05:56.626 --> 05:59.261
Homer, I think you dominoed this.

05:59.276 --> 06:00.532
That's ridiculous.

06:00.548 --> 06:02.072
If I had set up those dominoes,

06:02.085 --> 06:05.470
I'd be wearing my special domino-setting-up kneepads.

06:08.825 --> 06:10.231
It was you.

06:10.238 --> 06:12.041
How is that possible?

06:12.046 --> 06:14.303
I've read that people do strange things in their sleep

06:14.306 --> 06:16.951
when they've taken Ambien--I mean Nappien.

06:17.606 --> 06:19.510
See? "May cause dry mouth,

06:19.518 --> 06:21.812
mood swings,and nighttime kookiness."

06:21.816 --> 06:22.930
Mood swings?!

06:23.196 --> 06:25.310
Mood swings.

06:25.726 --> 06:28.100
Mood swings!

06:28.466 --> 06:31.253
Mood swings? Mood swings!

06:31.858 --> 06:33.800
Mood swings!

06:34.406 --> 06:35.602
Mood swings!

06:35.605 --> 06:38.783
Mood swings!

06:38.785 --> 06:39.993
Mood swings,mood swings!

06:40.406 --> 06:41.760
Mood swings!

06:46.626 --> 06:48.710
Nappien, you did it again.

06:48.718 --> 06:51.681
And everything is as it should be.

06:52.115 --> 06:53.440
John Lennon?!

06:54.518 --> 06:55.510
Yoko?

06:57.666 --> 07:00.010
So you're the one behind all these hijinks

07:00.027 --> 07:01.930
at the Rock 'N' Roll Wax Museum.

07:05.508 --> 07:06.840
Thank you. Thank you.

07:07.248 --> 07:08.830
Thank you. Thank you.

07:10.075 --> 07:13.391
Mr. Simpson, why did you hurt the dollies?

07:13.397 --> 07:15.672
Well, son, your Uncle Homer is

07:15.675 --> 07:17.791
like 80% of America

07:17.938 --> 07:20.810
wacked out on prescription drugs.

07:20.818 --> 07:22.911
But users are losers.

07:22.957 --> 07:25.173
You're confusing drugs with...

07:25.186 --> 07:28.091
drugs.

07:28.945 --> 07:30.270
Okay, here's the solution.

07:30.275 --> 07:31.740
I want you kids to lock the

07:31.946 --> 07:33.293
bedroom from the outside,

07:33.296 --> 07:34.461
so I can't get out

07:34.468 --> 07:36.630
and perpetrate my nocturnal mischief.

07:36.636 --> 07:38.063
Why don't you just quit taking the pills,

07:38.065 --> 07:38.961
you hophead?

07:38.996 --> 07:41.391
Because I'm filled with stress!

07:41.516 --> 07:44.531
Oh! I have three kids and no money!

07:44.535 --> 07:48.091
Why can't I have no kids and three money?

08:02.866 --> 08:04.391
Why am I sleeping when right

08:04.397 --> 08:05.982
next door is every boy's dream:

08:05.985 --> 08:08.603
a fat, suggestible zombie dad?

08:16.487 --> 08:17.413
Hey, zombie?

08:17.426 --> 08:18.092
Huh?

08:18.096 --> 08:19.340
Want to come out and play?

08:19.446 --> 08:21.321
Zombie kill.

08:21.326 --> 08:22.361
No, play!

08:22.518 --> 08:24.870
Zombie file grievance.

08:27.216 --> 08:29.551
Whoa! Your dad's a zombie?

08:29.557 --> 08:31.671
Let's make him give us haircuts.

08:35.168 --> 08:36.460
How does it look?

08:36.466 --> 08:37.280
Ooh.

08:39.267 --> 08:41.221
And that's only one of the cool things

08:41.236 --> 08:42.361
we're going to do with him.

08:42.376 --> 08:45.023
Zombie montage.

09:13.837 --> 09:16.811
Oh! My stomach is groaning with

09:16.816 --> 09:18.391
walnut meat.

09:18.397 --> 09:20.073
Come on.Just one more.

09:21.885 --> 09:24.041
What the...?! My car?!

09:24.058 --> 09:26.311
Milhouse?! Nutmeat?!

09:59.385 --> 10:00.822
Oh, my God, what have I done?!

10:01.137 --> 10:03.811
You've horribly injured the whole fire department!

10:03.817 --> 10:05.402
What are you,a travel agent?

10:05.405 --> 10:07.273
'Cause you're sending me on a guilt trip.

10:07.276 --> 10:07.860
Sorry.

10:10.308 --> 10:12.373
Well, our brave firemen recuperate,

10:12.375 --> 10:14.971
Springfield is a town without a fire department,

10:14.976 --> 10:16.273
which is bad news

10:16.286 --> 10:17.671
for people like this man.

10:17.677 --> 10:19.353
Sir, how does it feel knowing

10:19.357 --> 10:20.570
that no one is coming to save you?

10:20.574 --> 10:22.672
Oh, not as bad as knowing that somewhere,

10:22.701 --> 10:24.288
gays are marrying each other.

10:24.290 --> 10:26.092
That's the real emergency, Kent.

10:26.099 --> 10:29.002
Once again, crisis has brought out the best in us.

10:29.348 --> 10:31.191
I feel kind of responsible.

10:31.195 --> 10:33.420
Maybe I should volunteer to be a fireman.

10:33.427 --> 10:34.753
Volunteer fireman?

10:34.755 --> 10:35.702
Count me in.

10:36.345 --> 10:38.361
Just call me Fireman Skinner.

10:38.376 --> 10:40.101
You know, I think I'll volunteer, too.

10:40.105 --> 10:41.850
Why did you say too?

10:41.857 --> 10:44.163
Well, I assume I'm not the first one.

10:44.167 --> 10:45.740
It is with great pride

10:45.745 --> 10:47.881
that I turn over the safety of this city

10:47.895 --> 10:50.173
to the first four people
who showed up.

10:50.178 --> 10:50.863
Mm-hmm.

10:50.865 --> 10:52.541
Your sense of civic duty

10:52.548 --> 10:55.530
and this pamphlet that came with the fire extinguisher

10:55.537 --> 10:58.832
are all the training you need or shall receive.

10:58.946 --> 10:59.793
Mm-hmm.Yeah!

10:59.807 --> 11:01.820
We're here to join the volunteer fire department.

11:01.826 --> 11:03.131
You're too late.
Beat it!

11:04.318 --> 11:05.751
Lousy civilians.

11:05.765 --> 11:07.241
I wish I could burn 'em all.

11:07.247 --> 11:09.403
Easy there, Fire Chief Moe.

11:10.748 --> 11:13.420
Oh, I can't wait for my first fire.

11:13.595 --> 11:14.431
Is that one?

11:14.445 --> 11:16.401
That's just someone barbecuing.

11:16.407 --> 11:17.270
Oh!

11:17.428 --> 11:18.342
Is that one?

11:18.345 --> 11:19.790
That's a guy with red hair.

11:19.798 --> 11:20.761
D'oh!

11:20.775 --> 11:22.523
Sweetheart, come to dinner.

11:22.528 --> 11:23.261
I can't!

11:23.266 --> 11:25.073
That fire siren could sound at any moment.

11:25.087 --> 11:26.421
Any moment.

11:26.735 --> 11:28.323
Any moment.

11:28.866 --> 11:30.840
All'altro.

11:33.615 --> 11:35.172
Did I say any moment?

11:36.196 --> 11:38.031
Any moment.

11:38.548 --> 11:39.773
What the hell is that?

11:39.777 --> 11:42.420
That's the fire siren!

11:42.535 --> 11:43.410
Woo-hoo!

11:43.677 --> 11:45.071
Marge, when you see me next,

11:45.077 --> 11:47.100
I'll be a soggy,smoky hero.

11:47.106 --> 11:48.111
Mmm.

11:48.925 --> 11:51.623
Soggy, smoky hero.

11:53.247 --> 11:55.883
Just come back alive, okay?

11:55.888 --> 11:57.782
Don't tell me how to do my job!

12:02.206 --> 12:04.920
You save-a Luigi's place !
Mwah ! Mwah !

12:05.216 --> 12:07.261
Luigi give you
all the food you want !

12:07.445 --> 12:08.513
On the house !

12:11.816 --> 12:13.312
Hey, this is sweet, huh ?

12:13.315 --> 12:15.040
Almost makes up
for not gettin' paid.

12:15.048 --> 12:16.111
We don't get what ?

12:20.927 --> 12:21.953
Oh, thank you.

12:21.965 --> 12:25.731
Your jaws ofare superior
to my movie Jaws of Life.

12:25.737 --> 12:27.670
You guys are the real deal,

12:27.686 --> 12:31.821
as opposed to my movie The Real Deal,
which was not the real deal.

12:31.955 --> 12:33.790
Well, uh, your thanks
makes it all worth it.

12:34.036 --> 12:36.103
No, I must thank you properly

12:36.206 --> 12:38.682
with crew jackets
from my less successful films.

12:38.688 --> 12:41.461
Total Explosion,
Father of the Presi-bot,

12:41.737 --> 12:44.221
I Shoot Your Face,
I Shoot Your Face Again,

12:44.225 --> 12:47.402
Frankenberry the Movie 2:
The Frankenberry Wears Prada.

12:47.805 --> 12:50.940
Ooh, leather arms !

12:51.007 --> 12:52.593
People just give you this stuff ?

12:52.826 --> 12:54.472
Hey, it's the least they can do

12:54.477 --> 12:57.583
after we saved them
from being melty-faced weirdoes.

12:57.796 --> 13:00.142
We are entitled to some
sort of compensation.

13:00.216 --> 13:02.632
- After all, we're volunteers.
- That's right, 'Pu.

13:02.868 --> 13:04.780
People owe us
because we're heroes.

13:05.028 --> 13:06.452
It's even on my business card.

13:06.528 --> 13:08.943
I printed them on the back
of my old business cards.

13:08.975 --> 13:10.170
See ? It's different.

13:14.858 --> 13:16.883
Mr. Burns, jump into this net !

13:16.955 --> 13:18.543
What's in it for me ?

13:18.557 --> 13:19.471
Just jump!

13:31.105 --> 13:34.082
So, I see by your tie
you're a Yale man, too.

13:34.137 --> 13:35.641
Let's croon, shall we ?

13:35.658 --> 13:38.451
Boola, boola, boola, boola...

13:40.956 --> 13:44.333
Well done, gentlemen.
Too bad Smithers didn't make it.

13:44.338 --> 13:46.532
- I'm right here, sir.
- Excellent.

13:46.596 --> 13:49.343
But since I thought you were dead,
you won't get paid this week.

13:49.348 --> 13:50.350
Make a note of it.

13:51.096 --> 13:52.912
Well, that doesn't
quite seem fair.

13:53.086 --> 13:56.133
But you four,
you're the real heroes.

13:56.567 --> 13:58.692
- Oh, we don't need...
- It was nothing, really.

13:58.698 --> 13:59.612
Just doing our job.

13:59.797 --> 14:02.191
- What do you think he will give us ?
- Fine art, I bet.

14:02.235 --> 14:04.140
No, no, no,
the complete Munsters on DVD !

14:04.215 --> 14:05.440
I hope it's spaghetti.

14:14.238 --> 14:15.693
Thank you, and good-bye.

14:15.935 --> 14:17.061
- Wha...?
- Wha...? Huh ?

14:17.065 --> 14:18.563
Ta-ta, toodle-loo.

14:18.637 --> 14:19.851
Go back to your tenements,

14:19.896 --> 14:21.912
where the O'Briens
live next to the Goldbergs,

14:21.968 --> 14:23.473
who rub elbows with Antonellis,

14:23.547 --> 14:26.190
and the only thing you have in common
is the squalor of your chamber pot !

14:26.287 --> 14:27.580
Oh, how I hate you !

14:27.697 --> 14:28.593
Bye-bye.

14:30.437 --> 14:31.561
Of all the nerve.

14:31.667 --> 14:33.152
Burns stiffed us !

14:33.485 --> 14:36.080
I can't believe he acted
completely in character.

14:36.215 --> 14:40.232
Lousy Burns, so ungrateful.
I hate himso much.

14:40.238 --> 14:41.723
Hold on a second, fellas.

14:41.775 --> 14:44.142
I don't like the looks
of that flaming ember.

14:44.146 --> 14:45.581
I'd better blow it out.

14:45.658 --> 14:46.781
Ha, ha, ha.

14:51.395 --> 14:52.310
Hmm. Hmm ?

15:03.935 --> 15:07.562
Oh, the fire has spread
to this room full of valuables.

15:07.568 --> 15:10.031
And it's our duty to follow it.

15:14.545 --> 15:15.873
Well, the fire's out, but, uh

15:16.385 --> 15:18.440
I think some of these valuables
are smoke-damaged.

15:18.726 --> 15:20.640
He's not gonna want 'em.
Heh-heh-heh.

15:20.887 --> 15:24.350
Moe, are you suggesting
that we should steal ?

15:24.446 --> 15:26.732
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
It ain't stealing if you take it fast.

15:34.446 --> 15:35.761
Gentlemen, I'd like to thank you.

15:35.945 --> 15:39.020
- You've saved my store.
- Well, most of it.

15:39.158 --> 15:40.371
What do you mean ?

15:40.547 --> 15:43.042
Uh, well, your building
will be fine, but unfortunately,

15:43.128 --> 15:45.680
a lot of your merchandise
was completely vaporized:

15:45.817 --> 15:48.990
high-end stereo equipment,
size 10 men's shoes...

15:49.147 --> 15:50.560
And some stuff I wanted.

15:50.837 --> 15:52.060
Oh, my.

15:52.177 --> 15:53.770
I didn't think
the damage was that bad.

15:53.906 --> 15:55.873
But you must be telling the truth.

15:56.036 --> 15:57.381
You're firemen, after all.

15:57.545 --> 15:58.821
Yeah, we're awesome.

15:59.185 --> 16:01.083
This'll make a great toilet seat.

16:11.738 --> 16:13.432
Uh, gentleman, I'm, uh...

16:14.276 --> 16:16.623
I'm starting to wonder
if we've crossed a line here.

16:17.418 --> 16:19.951
Just what are you getting at ?

16:20.125 --> 16:21.173
Yeah, Hall Pass.

16:21.307 --> 16:23.152
You better not be thinking
of ratting us out.

16:23.378 --> 16:26.531
It would be a shame if the next
fire you fought was in hell !

16:27.186 --> 16:29.942
Okay, okay.
I'll just look the other way.

16:35.787 --> 16:37.782
You guys sure aren't
making this easy.

16:45.996 --> 16:47.600
Oh, thank God there's a fire.

16:47.745 --> 16:49.153
Marge's birthday's coming up.

16:49.318 --> 16:51.940
I think what she would treasure
most is a gift bought through

16:52.118 --> 16:53.483
honest effort because...

16:54.328 --> 16:55.192
...integrity...

16:56.095 --> 16:56.980
...trust...

16:57.437 --> 16:58.661
...exploitation...

16:59.216 --> 17:00.213
...the golden rule...

17:00.887 --> 17:01.890
...role models...

17:02.395 --> 17:03.430
...seriousrime...

17:04.106 --> 17:05.113
...zero tolerance...

17:05.744 --> 17:07.112
...the Ten Commandments...

17:14.597 --> 17:16.542
Next time Maggie
does that in a pool,

17:16.676 --> 17:19.561
tell me quietly;
don't announce it.

17:19.666 --> 17:22.510
But, Mom, the lifeguards
have to know.

17:22.636 --> 17:24.262
Just let the chemicals deal with it.

17:25.586 --> 17:27.161
Look at me !
I'm a fireman !

17:28.006 --> 17:29.893
Hey, Mom, can we go see
Dad put out the fire ?

17:30.047 --> 17:32.841
Well, I guess every boy
should see his father as a hero.

17:35.158 --> 17:37.382
Hey, guys, check out
the radical-free air

17:37.478 --> 17:39.782
generated bymy stolen Ionic Breeze.

17:40.045 --> 17:43.831
Oh, bogus gizmo,
grant me eternal life.

17:44.375 --> 17:47.742
Mom, is Dad stealing from people
he's supposed to help ?

17:49.067 --> 17:51.320
King of thieves, we worship you.

17:53.035 --> 17:54.582
He is stealing !

17:56.407 --> 17:57.571
Look at me, guys !

17:57.845 --> 18:00.311
I'm stealing
five Segways at once !

18:00.525 --> 18:02.103
And speaking of segues,

18:02.228 --> 18:05.520
I'm off to my next
morally questionable activity!

18:09.618 --> 18:12.241
You're nothing but a
diabolical master thief!

18:12.385 --> 18:14.503
The kind that haunts
the slopes of Saint Moritz

18:14.636 --> 18:16.551
or the casinos of Monte Carlo !

18:16.718 --> 18:18.843
We're not thieves;
we're scavengers,

18:19.075 --> 18:21.632
like the beautiful vulture
or the heroic tapeworm,

18:21.816 --> 18:24.333
or America's sweetheart,
the maggot.

18:24.497 --> 18:28.781
You should've seenthe faces o four
children when they caught you stealing.

18:29.056 --> 18:32.253
Kids, get in here and
show your father the face !

18:39.325 --> 18:40.591
Make them stop !

18:40.798 --> 18:43.533
You make them stop
by doing the right thing.

18:45.765 --> 18:48.452
<i>Sadyes</i>

18:49.106 --> 18:51.312
<i>Turn the other way</i>

18:52.448 --> 18:56.563
<i>I don't want to see you cry</i>

18:58.988 --> 19:02.082
<i>Sad eyes</i>

19:02.256 --> 19:04.881
<i>You knew there'd come a day</i>

19:05.576 --> 19:10.013
<i>When we wouldhave to say good-bye</i>

19:12.515 --> 19:15.401
<i>Sad eyes.</i>

19:26.796 --> 19:28.023
Moe, can we talk ?

19:28.216 --> 19:30.211
Are you crazy ?
It's 500 degrees in here !

19:31.045 --> 19:33.800
Oh, no, wait, it's only 495.
What's on your mind?

19:33.975 --> 19:36.553
- Moe, I think we may have perverted...
- Go on.

19:36.728 --> 19:38.383
...our duties as firemen.

19:41.628 --> 19:42.770
First Skinner, now you.

19:43.017 --> 19:44.532
Well, maybe you got a point.

19:44.797 --> 19:47.322
Maybe we...
A solid gold grandfather clock !

19:48.426 --> 19:50.490
Oh ! This thing's hotter
than Ellen Barkin !

19:53.736 --> 19:56.960
Moe, I can save you, but you
have to let go of the clock !

19:57.208 --> 19:59.722
But it's been in my family
for over 40 seconds !

20:02.327 --> 20:03.501
Wait, wait, wait,wait, wait !

20:03.718 --> 20:04.613
What about Nabu ?

20:06.118 --> 20:07.210
Apu is dead.

20:07.525 --> 20:09.790
I was reincarnated as this cat.

20:11.605 --> 20:13.932
Oh, you have just been Apu'd !

20:26.657 --> 20:29.022
My baby !
My baby !

20:29.607 --> 20:31.932
Could do worse than
grow up to be like you, sir.

20:32.188 --> 20:34.280
Let's hear it for Homer !

20:39.326 --> 20:42.380
So Daddy saved Apu and Moe.

20:42.646 --> 20:44.590
And believe me,
we learned our lesson.

20:44.815 --> 20:45.830
What'd you do with all the loot ?

20:46.005 --> 20:49.210
We sent it to skid row,
where it would do the most good.

20:51.107 --> 20:53.730
Look at me.
I'm the bum of the future !
