SPEAK SPANISH.MAYBE YOUDON'T.

12:31.185 --> 12:33.013
GUN!

12:48.245 --> 12:50.247
COVER ME!

13:05.654 --> 13:06.873
[bullet ricochets]

13:06.960 --> 13:08.788
[thud]

13:08.875 --> 13:10.833
[under breath] ERES UN IDIOTA.

13:10.920 --> 13:12.617
THROW OUT YOUR WEAPON!

13:12.704 --> 13:14.271
LA PISTOLA!

13:14.358 --> 13:16.665
DO IT NOW!

13:20.887 --> 13:24.673
STEP INTO CLEAR VIEW!
HANDS IN THE AIR!

13:32.942 --> 13:36.163
FACE DOWN ON THE GROUND. HANDS
OUT TO YOUR SIDES. DO IT NOW.

13:37.207 --> 13:38.818
[click]

13:41.516 --> 13:43.257
HEY! HEY, HEY, EASY! EASY!

13:43.344 --> 13:45.868
YEAH, NOW HE UNDERSTANDS
ENGLISH.SO...

13:45.955 --> 13:49.437
WHAT KIND OF ANCIENT ART
YOU BOYS SELLING TODAY, HUH?

14:06.280 --> 14:08.673
ROBERTO SALVADOR.

14:08.760 --> 14:10.937
YOU'RE ON A WORK VISA
FROM COLUMBIA.

14:11.024 --> 14:13.287
SO YOU WORK FOR MONTERO?

14:13.374 --> 14:15.463
HMM. COULD BE.

14:15.550 --> 14:18.945
COULD BE MONTERO
WORKS FOR ME. [chuckles]

14:19.032 --> 14:20.468
ATTITUDE. REALLY?

14:23.079 --> 14:25.299
UH, WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

14:25.386 --> 14:27.605
TO WRITE YOU UP ON CHARGES
OF RUNNING GUNS,

14:27.692 --> 14:28.998
RESISTING ARREST,
ATTEMPTED MURDER...

14:29.085 --> 14:33.133
HEY, HEY, HEY, CaLMATE.
TRANQUILO.

14:33.220 --> 14:35.439
I SHOT AT YOU
BECAUSE YOU SHOT AT ME.

14:35.526 --> 14:38.268
WHAT--WHAT CAN I DO HERE?
I GOT A FAMILY, YOU KNOW.

14:38.355 --> 14:41.576
I WANNA SEE THEM AGAIN.YOU ANSWER MY QUESTIONS.
NO ATTITUDE.

14:41.663 --> 14:44.535
MAYBE WE'LL FORGET
ABOUT THE ATTEMPTED MURDER.

14:44.622 --> 14:48.496
GOOD. SIT DOWN.
PUT YOUR FEET UP.

14:51.629 --> 14:53.457
WHY DID MONTERO HIRE YOU?

14:53.544 --> 14:56.504
TO RUN HIS SHIPPING OPERATION.WEAPONS OR ANTIQUITIES?

14:56.591 --> 14:58.245
BOTH.

14:58.332 --> 15:00.334
MANUEL WAS AN HONEST BUSINESSMAN
FOR MANY YEARS,

15:00.421 --> 15:02.597
BUT THE PROFIT IN THOSE
MUSEUM PIECES WENT AWAY.

15:02.684 --> 15:04.773
TOO MANY LEGAL BARRIERS.

15:04.860 --> 15:07.732
POLITICOS, CRIMINALESTO BRIBE.

15:07.819 --> 15:09.734
SO MONTERO STARTED
TRAFFICKING GUNS.

15:09.821 --> 15:12.520
HE HAD HIS COMPANY ALL SET UP.
HE COULD SHIP THEM

15:12.607 --> 15:15.044
TO SOUTH AMERICA, NO QUESTIONS
ASKED, THEN TRADE THEM

15:15.131 --> 15:17.525
FOR ALL THE BLACK MARKET
ANTIQUITIES HE COULD HANDLE.

15:17.612 --> 15:19.527
DID MONTERO HAVE ANY ENEMIES?

15:19.614 --> 15:22.312
NO. HE WAS BELOVED.

15:22.399 --> 15:25.141
IN COLOMBIA, THEY CALLED HIM
EL PROFESOR.

15:25.228 --> 15:26.708
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

15:26.795 --> 15:28.928
WELL, IT HAS
A CERTAIN PULP APPEAL,

15:29.015 --> 15:31.234
AS FAR AS MYSTERIES GO--

15:31.321 --> 15:33.628
MURDER IN THE MUSEUM,
STOLEN MAYAN GOLD,

15:33.715 --> 15:35.282
COLOMBIAN GUN RUNNERS--

15:35.369 --> 15:37.414
BUT IT'S A TAWDRY WORK
OF FICTION,

15:37.501 --> 15:39.112
COMPLETELY MADE UP.

15:39.199 --> 15:41.375
OH, I'M PRETTY SURE
MONTERO'S DEAD.

15:41.462 --> 15:44.117
BUT NOT FOR THE REASONS
THAT WE'RE BEING LED TO BELIEVE.

15:44.204 --> 15:45.945
HOW CAN YOU TELL?

15:46.032 --> 15:49.600
I FIND IT EASIER
TO SHOW THAN TO TELL.

15:49.687 --> 15:51.646
UH, EXCUSE ME.[door closes]

15:51.733 --> 15:53.169
COULD YOU TELL ME
WHO MONTERO

15:53.256 --> 15:56.477
WAS TRADING WEAPONS
TO IN SOUTH AMERICA?

15:56.564 --> 15:59.915
ANSWER THE QUESTION.CARTELS, GANGS,
PRIVATE ARMIES.

16:00.002 --> 16:01.699
OH, MAKES SENSE.

16:01.786 --> 16:04.920
IF THEY WANTED HIM DEAD,
HOW WOULD THEY GO ABOUT THAT?

16:05.007 --> 16:07.009
YOU WOULD NEVER KNOW HOW.
HE WOULD JUST...

16:07.096 --> 16:09.055
[blows air] DISAPPEAR.

16:09.142 --> 16:10.882
OKAY.

16:10.970 --> 16:14.364
AND IF THE BODY JUST HAPPENED
TO BE FOUND MIRACULOUSLY,

16:14.451 --> 16:15.670
WHERE MIGHT THAT BE?

16:15.757 --> 16:19.195
UH, A MASS GRAVE.
SIDE OF A ROAD.

16:19.282 --> 16:22.633
WE FOUND HIM STABBED
AND BLED OUT IN A PUBLIC MUSEUM.

16:22.720 --> 16:24.418
WOULD YOU KILL A MAN THAT WAY?

16:24.505 --> 16:27.160
HELL, NO. HEH.
TOO HIGH-RISK.

16:30.641 --> 16:33.166
SOMEBODY KILLED MONTERO
FOR REASONS

16:33.253 --> 16:35.516
THAT HAD NOTHING
TO DO WITH PRE-COLUMBIAN ART

16:35.603 --> 16:38.171
AND NOTHING TO DO
WITH COLOMBIAN CARTELS.

16:38.258 --> 16:42.784
THAT'S JUST WHAT THE KILLER
WANTED US TO THINK.

16:42.871 --> 16:44.829
OH, I ASKED CONWAY
OVER AT GAMBLING CONTROL

16:44.916 --> 16:47.136
TO JOIN OUR INVESTIGATION
INTO THE LOAN SHARK SYNDICATE.

16:47.223 --> 16:50.444
CONWAY'S A GOOD MAN, BUT HE CAN
TALK THE PAINT OFF A CAR.

16:50.531 --> 16:51.967
DON'T LET HIM
RUN THE BRIEFINGS.

16:52.054 --> 16:53.012
DIRECTOR BERTRAM.

16:53.099 --> 16:55.840
J.J., YOU WAITING FOR ME?

16:55.927 --> 16:57.581
SPECIAL AGENT HIGHTOWER,
ACTUALLY.

17:07.156 --> 17:08.114
GOODNIGHT.

17:08.201 --> 17:10.116
NIGHT.

17:13.293 --> 17:15.686
A VISUAL RECONSTRUCTION

17:15.773 --> 17:18.385
OF THE NIGHT
OF TODD JOHNSON'S MURDER,

17:18.472 --> 17:20.822
BASED ON SECURITY FOOTAGE,

17:20.909 --> 17:22.824
ACTIVITY LOGS,

17:22.911 --> 17:26.349
AND 86 HOURS OF INTERVIEWS.

17:26.436 --> 17:28.047
NICE PROJECT BOARD.

17:28.134 --> 17:29.352
[portfolio hits desk]

17:29.439 --> 17:31.311
BET YOU WON
A FEW SCIENCE FAIRS.

17:31.398 --> 17:33.400
HMM.

17:35.793 --> 17:37.578
I WON ALL OF THEM.

17:42.626 --> 17:46.413
THIS IS THE HOLDING CELL
WHERE JOHNSON WAS BURNED ALIVE.

17:46.500 --> 17:48.067
THE CIRCLES INDICATE

17:48.154 --> 17:50.330
THE LOCATION OF PEOPLE
WITHIN CBI,

17:50.417 --> 17:54.464
MOMENTS BEFORE HIS MURDER.

17:54.551 --> 17:57.293
MY RESEARCH REVEALED THAT

17:57.380 --> 18:01.080
THIS GROUP OF PEOPLE DID NOT
HAVE THE SECURITY CLEARANCE

18:01.167 --> 18:03.821
TO ENTER THE HOLDING AREA.

18:07.869 --> 18:10.567
THISGROUP--

18:10.654 --> 18:13.309
THEY WERE ALL TOO FAR AWAY
TO HAVE SET THE FIRE.

18:15.572 --> 18:17.661
THESE...

18:17.748 --> 18:19.620
ALL HAVE AT LEAST

18:19.707 --> 18:22.797
TWO OR MORE WITNESSES
WHO CAN VERIFY

18:22.884 --> 18:26.279
THEIR LOCATION
AT THE TIME OF THE ATTACK.

18:30.631 --> 18:32.328
FIVE CIRCLES.

18:36.202 --> 18:38.508
THIS ONE IS... YOU.

18:38.595 --> 18:41.207
IS IT?

18:41.294 --> 18:44.166
I OFFER YOU THIS--

18:44.253 --> 18:46.081
FIVE SUSPECTS...

18:46.168 --> 18:47.996
WITHIN STRIKING DISTANCE...

18:48.083 --> 18:50.433
OF JOHNSON...

18:50.520 --> 18:54.916
EACH ONE HIGHLY CAPABLE...

18:55.003 --> 18:57.484
BUT ONLY ONE...

18:57.571 --> 19:00.313
WITH A CLEAR MOTIVE.

19:00.400 --> 19:01.836
[sighs] OKAY.

19:03.664 --> 19:04.969
OKAY.

19:05.056 --> 19:07.058
I WAS SLEEPING
WITH OFFICER HOWARD.

19:07.146 --> 19:09.322
[clears throat]

19:09.409 --> 19:11.628
BUT I DIDN'T... [sighs]

19:11.715 --> 19:13.500
I-I... [sighs]

19:16.285 --> 19:19.288
AT THE TIME HOWARD WAS KILLED,
WE WERE NO LONGER TOGETHER.

19:19.375 --> 19:20.681
HIS CHOICE OR YOURS?

19:20.768 --> 19:23.205
MUTUAL DECISION.
IT--IT--IT WASN'T...

19:23.292 --> 19:26.643
[breathes heavily]

19:26.730 --> 19:29.733
DID YOU SET
TODD JOHNSON ON FIRE?

19:29.820 --> 19:32.258
NO, I DID NOT.

19:35.739 --> 19:38.220
YOU MUST HAVE BEEN...

19:38.307 --> 19:39.961
GRIEVING...

19:40.048 --> 19:41.615
ABOUT HOWARD.

19:43.747 --> 19:46.054
HOW DID YOU DEAL WITH THAT?

19:46.141 --> 19:48.578
I GOT ON MY KNEES
AND I ASKED THE LORD

19:48.665 --> 19:50.493
FOR STRENGTH AND FORGIVENESS.

19:50.580 --> 19:53.061
THAT'S HOW I DEALT WITH THAT.

19:55.933 --> 19:58.197
YOU MIGHT WANT
TO WRITE THAT DOWN.

19:59.981 --> 20:02.984
I THINK I'LL REMEMBER IT.

20:10.426 --> 20:12.167
HEY, JANE.
YOU WERE RIGHT.

20:12.254 --> 20:15.039
WELL, OF COURSE. WHAT INSTANCE
OF RIGHTNESS ARE WE SPEAKING OF?

20:15.126 --> 20:17.346
YESTERDAY, WHEN YOU SAID
MONTERO WAS KILLED FOR REASONS

20:17.433 --> 20:19.348
HAVING NOTHING TO DO
WITH THE STOLEN ARTIFACTS.

20:19.435 --> 20:21.176
SO I STAYED UP LATE
LAST NIGHT,

20:21.263 --> 20:22.699
AND I RESEARCHED
HIS PERSONAL LIFE.

20:22.786 --> 20:24.614
SOMEONE SHOULD STAY UP
AND RESEARCH YOURS.

20:24.701 --> 20:26.877
YOU'LL NEVER GUESS
WHERE HE GREW UP.WON'T TRY.

20:26.964 --> 20:28.444
[both] VINELAND, CALIFORNIA.

20:28.531 --> 20:31.230
HOW DID YOU DO THAT?FOLLOWED YOUR LIPS. VINELAND?

20:31.317 --> 20:34.058
HOMETOWN OF INFAMOUS
COP KILLER TODD JOHNSON?

20:34.145 --> 20:38.411
FOLLOW ME.

20:38.498 --> 20:42.023
DID YOU PRINT THAT PHOTO
I SENT YOU LAST NIGHT?THAT'S JOHNSON AND MONTERO.

20:42.110 --> 20:44.330
THEY WERE CO-CAPTAINS OF THEIR
HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL TEAM.

20:44.417 --> 20:46.288
ARE YOU GETTING THIS?
OUR MURDER VICTIM

20:46.375 --> 20:48.943
WAS BEST FRIENDS
WITH THE SERIAL COP KILLER.

20:49.030 --> 20:50.945
IT'S A GREAT PHOTO.

20:51.032 --> 20:53.469
AFTER THAT, I ASKED CHO
TO GO TO MONTERO'S

20:53.556 --> 20:56.777
WAREHOUSE LAST NIGHT, SEE IF
HE COULD FIND ANY OTHER LINKS.

20:56.864 --> 21:00.171
TELL HIM WHAT YOU FOUND.MONTERO BOUGHT HIS GUNS
FROM GUN SHOPS.

21:00.259 --> 21:02.609
PAID PEOPLE WITH CLEAN RECORDS
TO MAKE THE BUYS.

21:02.696 --> 21:05.525
HAS A RECORD OF EVERY PURCHASE,
INCLUDING SERIAL NUMBERS.

21:05.612 --> 21:08.049
TRACED ONE OF THE SERIAL
NUMBERS BACK TO A WEAPON

21:08.136 --> 21:09.616
MONTERO GAVE
TO HIS BUDDY JOHNSON.

21:09.703 --> 21:12.575
RIGHT. SAME WEAPON JOHNSON
USED TO KILL HIS VICTIMS.

21:12.662 --> 21:15.361
WHOA.

21:15.448 --> 21:17.667
HAVE YOU MENTIONED
ANY OF THIS TO LaROCHE?

21:17.754 --> 21:20.453
I SET A BRIEFING WITH
TOP BRASS IN TEN MINUTES.

21:20.540 --> 21:23.586
LaROCHE, BERTRAM, AND HIGHTOWER
WILL ALL BE THERE.

21:23.673 --> 21:24.587
TEN MINUTES, CHO.

21:24.674 --> 21:26.197
YEP.

21:29.418 --> 21:30.767
[rattle]

21:30.854 --> 21:34.554
[sighs]

21:34.641 --> 21:35.859
UH, EXCUSE ME.

21:35.946 --> 21:37.992
I'M LOOKING
FOR THE FINGERPRINT LAB.

21:38.079 --> 21:40.255
THAT'S--THAT'S ME.
WHO ARE... YOU?

21:40.342 --> 21:41.778
PATRICK JANE.

21:41.865 --> 21:45.260
ANY LUCK WITH THE CURIOUS
CASE OF THE RIB?

21:47.044 --> 21:48.655
LOOK, I DON'T REALLY...

21:48.742 --> 21:51.745
FUNCTION EFFICIENTLY
UNDER PRESSURE, SO...

21:51.832 --> 21:55.444
HEY, NO PRESSURE. JUST WONDERING
IF YOU'D FOUND ANY MATCHES YET.

21:55.531 --> 21:58.317
WELL, I'VE SCANNED A TOTAL
OF 32 FULL AND PARTIAL PRINTS

21:58.404 --> 22:01.320
FROM THAT FOSSIL,
BUT FOR EVERY PRINT THAT I SCAN,

22:01.407 --> 22:04.192
DOZENS OF POSSIBLE MATCHES...

22:04.279 --> 22:06.673
COME BACK.
THEN I HAVE TO CHECK THEM

22:06.760 --> 22:10.198
MANUALLY ONE BY ONE
TO FIND A MATCH, SO...

22:10.285 --> 22:12.069
I'M NOT DAVID CARUSO.
IT TAKES TIME.

22:12.156 --> 22:13.854
WELL, YOU DO YOUR THING.

22:13.941 --> 22:17.553
I'M GONNA TAKE A QUICK PEEK
AT YOUR LIST IF YOU DON'T MIND.

22:17.640 --> 22:20.426
[tapping on keys]

22:24.081 --> 22:26.562
PUSH HARD ON THIS ONE.
WE NEED A RAPID RESPONSE.

22:26.649 --> 22:28.651
REMEMBER, ANY TIME WASTED'S
GONE FOREVER.

22:28.738 --> 22:31.524
I'M NOT WASTING TIME.

22:31.611 --> 22:34.135
ARE YOU SUGGESTING
YOU DON'T HAVE ENOUGH TIME?

22:34.222 --> 22:37.051
YOU HAVE EXACTLY THE SAME
NUMBER OF HOURS IN THE DAY

22:37.138 --> 22:39.314
THAT ALBERT EINSTEIN HAD.CAN YOU STOP?

22:39.401 --> 22:43.405
THOMAS JEFFERSON.
LOUIS PASTEUR. GANDHI.

22:43.492 --> 22:46.277
JUST GET OUT OF... HERE.
OH, MY GOD!

22:46.365 --> 22:50.630
OH, MY GOD. WHAT DO I DO?

22:50.717 --> 22:52.066
[groans]

22:52.153 --> 22:53.676
KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK.

22:53.763 --> 22:55.199
[beeping]AAH...

22:55.286 --> 22:57.419
MONTERO WAS FOUND
AT THE ARCHEOLOGY MUSEUM

22:57.506 --> 22:59.203
WITH STAB WOUNDS.
NEXT TO HIM,

22:59.290 --> 23:03.033
A DISPLAY CASE WITH A MISSING
PENDANT WORTH OVER $200,000.

23:03.120 --> 23:04.513
THE NIGHT OF THE MURDER,

23:04.600 --> 23:06.820
MONTERO WAS SUPPOSED TO MEET
A PROSPECTIVE BUYER.

23:06.907 --> 23:09.692
FIRST, WE THOUGHT
THE MISSING PENDANT...[lowered voice] HIGHTOWER.

23:09.779 --> 23:12.782
We need to talk in private.
I'll meet you in my perch.

23:12.869 --> 23:16.046
I DON'T HAVE TIME NOW, JANE.
I'M IN THE MIDDLE OF A BRIEFING.

23:16.133 --> 23:19.920
YEAH. I CAN SEE THAT.

23:20.007 --> 23:21.922
[Lisbon] MONTERO WAS RUNNING
GUNS TO SOUTH AMERICA...

23:22.009 --> 23:24.533
THE MONTERO CASE HAS TURNED
INTO A HIGH-PRIORITY

23:24.620 --> 23:27.318
MURDER INVESTIGATION.
I CAN'T JUST WALK OUT.

23:27.406 --> 23:31.192
I SUGGEST YOU RETHINK
WHAT YOU CAN AND CANNOT DO

23:31.279 --> 23:33.716
FROM THIS MOMENT FORWARD,
BECAUSE I KNOW

23:33.803 --> 23:36.327
WHO THE EVIDENCE IS ABOUT
TO REVEAL AS THE KILLER.

23:36.415 --> 23:38.852
WHO?

23:38.939 --> 23:40.419
YOU.

23:43.117 --> 23:46.686
[Lisbon]
AS A MATTER OF FACT,
THEY'RE BEST FRIENDS.

23:53.562 --> 23:55.999
MONTERO'S GUN RUNNING OPERATION
SUPPLIED JOHNSON

23:56.086 --> 23:58.785
WITH THE WEAPON THAT WAS USED
TO KILL OUR FELLOW OFFICERS.

23:58.872 --> 24:00.308
WE'RE WORKING ON THE THEORY

24:00.395 --> 24:03.093
THAT WHOEVER TOOK OUT JOHNSON
ALSO TOOK OUT MONTERO.

24:03.180 --> 24:06.619
EXCUSE ME, AGENTS.
URGENT MATTER TO DEAL WITH.

24:06.706 --> 24:08.925
SO YOU'RE SUGGESTING BOTH
MURDERS WERE PART

24:09.012 --> 24:10.144
OF A VENGEANCE PLAY?

24:10.231 --> 24:12.102
YES, I AM, SIR.

24:12.189 --> 24:14.104
SOMEBODY WANTED BOTH
OF THESE MEN DEAD.

24:14.191 --> 24:17.412
JOHNSON THE COP KILLER
AND MONTERO...

24:34.603 --> 24:36.083
JANE, THIS BETTER BE...

24:36.170 --> 24:39.913
GOOD. MY SENTIMENTS PRECISELY.

24:40.000 --> 24:42.568
WHERE'D YOU GET THAT?

24:42.655 --> 24:46.572
I BORROWED A KEY TO THE ARMORY
FROM LISBON'S DESK.

24:46.659 --> 24:49.052
ARE YOU A KILLER?

24:49.139 --> 24:52.142
I DON'T KNOW YOUR GAME HERE,
BUT I DON'T HAVE TIME

24:52.229 --> 24:54.884
TO BE TAKEN ON ONE OF
YOUR EMOTIONAL JOYRIDES.

24:54.971 --> 24:57.060
NOT THAT I'M JUDGING.

24:57.147 --> 25:00.020
SEEKING REVENGE ON MEN THAT ARE
RESPONSIBLE FOR THE DEATH OF

25:00.107 --> 25:03.110
SOMEONE YOU LOVE--IT'S A HOBBY
I LIKE TO DABBLE IN MYSELF.

25:03.197 --> 25:05.112
YOU THINK IT'S TRUE?

25:05.199 --> 25:07.854
YOU THINK IT'S TRUE THAT--THAT
I KILLED JOHNSON AND MONTERO?

25:07.941 --> 25:11.161
WELL, LET'S JUST SAY
I'M OPEN-MINDED.

25:11.248 --> 25:13.076
ANY MINUTE NOW, THE LAB

25:13.163 --> 25:16.297
IS GOING TO IDENTIFY YOUR PRINTS
AT THE MONTERO CRIME SCENE.

25:16.384 --> 25:18.517
I HAVE NEVER BEEN
TO THAT MUSEUM.

25:18.604 --> 25:21.302
WELL, THEN YOU'RE
EITHER BEING FRAMED...

25:21.389 --> 25:23.217
OR YOU'RE A LUNATIC KILLER.

25:23.304 --> 25:26.307
IN EITHER CASE, YOU SHOULD PHONE
YOUR FAMILY, 'CAUSE MY GUESS IS

25:26.394 --> 25:28.875
THE POT ROAST IS GONNA BE SERVED
A LITTLE LATE.

25:28.962 --> 25:30.703
IF YOU DON'T POINT
THAT SHOTGUN AWAY,

25:30.790 --> 25:33.619
I WILL USE IT
TO BEAT YOU LIKE A RENTED MULE.

25:33.706 --> 25:36.230
SPOKEN LIKE
A TRUE LUNATIC KILLER.

25:36.317 --> 25:39.886
YOU'RE NOT GIVING ME MUCH
TO WORK WITH HERE.I MEAN IT.

25:39.973 --> 25:41.278
SO DO I.

25:44.586 --> 25:47.328
DID YOU KILL THOSE MEN?

25:47.415 --> 25:49.809
I HAVE TO KNOW.

25:49.896 --> 25:51.680
WHY, JANE?

25:51.767 --> 25:55.858
IF YOU THINK I'M GUILTY,
TURN ME OVER TO LaROCHE.

25:55.945 --> 25:57.468
I'LL GO.

25:57.556 --> 26:01.037
NO. IF YOU KILLED TODD JOHNSON,
THEN YOU'RE MINE,

26:01.124 --> 26:04.214
AND YOU'RE GONNA LEAD ME
STRAIGHT TO RED JOHN.

26:04.301 --> 26:06.260
RED JOHN?
WHAT DOES THIS HAVE TO D--

26:06.347 --> 26:10.220
TODD WAS TAKEN OUT 'CAUSE
HE KNEW RED JOHN'S SECRETS.

26:10.307 --> 26:13.484
AS IF YOU DIDN'T KNOW THAT.

26:13.572 --> 26:16.009
AND IF YOU DIDN'T KNOW IT,
THE REAL INSIDER

26:16.096 --> 26:19.316
MURDERED MONTERO TO FRAME YOU,
WHICH BRINGS US THE FULL CIRCLE.

26:19.403 --> 26:22.102
ARE YOU OR ARE YOU NOT
A KILLER?

26:24.278 --> 26:29.283
YOU KNOW WHAT I AM, JANE?

26:29.370 --> 26:31.764
[voice breaking]
I'M A SINGLE MOM...

26:31.851 --> 26:33.722
WITH TWO INNOCENT
CHILDREN AT HOME.

26:35.811 --> 26:38.553
THERE'S NOTHING IN THE WORLD
I WOULD DO

26:38.640 --> 26:42.601
TO COMPROMISE
THEIR SAFETY OR THEIR FUTURE.

26:45.560 --> 26:47.475
[whispers] PLEASE, JANE.

26:48.998 --> 26:51.522
[grunts]

26:51.610 --> 26:53.307
[panting]

26:59.748 --> 27:01.924
I'VE HEARD ENOUGH TO CONVINCE ME
THAT WE'RE LOOKING

27:02.011 --> 27:05.841
FOR ONE KILLER HERE.
J.J., YOU TAKE LEAD.

27:05.928 --> 27:09.540
THIS IS NOW
A DOUBLE MURDER INVESTIGATION.

27:09.628 --> 27:11.717
EXCUSE ME, DIRECTOR BERTRAM,
I'M SORRY. SORRY, EVERYBODY.

27:11.804 --> 27:13.980
UM, YOU ASKED FOR DEVELOPMENTS
ON THE MONTERO CASE.

27:14.067 --> 27:16.635
I THINK THIS QUALIFIES.

27:16.722 --> 27:19.072
THIS HAS TO BE
A FALSE POSITIVE.

27:19.159 --> 27:22.249
NO, I CHECKED AND DOUBLE-CHECKED
ALL THE BIFURCATIONS.

27:22.336 --> 27:24.468
IT'S A CLEAR MATCH.WHAT IS IT?

27:24.555 --> 27:28.168
A MISTAKE. HIGHTOWER'S PRINTS
AT THE MONTERO CRIME SCENE?

27:28.255 --> 27:29.996
I'M NOT SURPRISED.

27:30.083 --> 27:32.520
HAVE ANOTHER ANALYST
VERIFY YOUR FINDINGS.YES, SIR.

27:32.607 --> 27:35.131
VAN PELT, START WORKING
ON A SEARCH WARRANT

27:35.218 --> 27:36.611
FOR AGENT HIGHTOWER'S HOME.

27:36.698 --> 27:38.918
IS THAT REALLY NECESSARY?

27:39.005 --> 27:41.398
SHE CAN ALWAYS GRANT US CONSENT.
SHE'S IN HER OFFICE.

27:41.485 --> 27:43.270
I'LL CALL OVER.

27:43.357 --> 27:45.533
CONTACT THE UNIVERSITY POLICE.
SEE IF THEY HAVE RECORD

27:45.620 --> 27:48.841
OF A VEHICLE MATCHING
AGENT HIGHTOWER'S ON CAMPUS

27:48.928 --> 27:52.061
THE NIGHT OF THE MURDER. ASK
THEM TO CHECK SECURITY FOOTAGE.

27:52.148 --> 27:53.672
YES, SIR.

27:53.759 --> 27:57.327
I DON'T LIKE THE WAY
THIS IS BEING HANDLED.

27:57.414 --> 28:00.766
CAN WE JUST TAKE A MOMENT BEFORE
WE DESTROY A COLLEAGUE'S CAREER?

28:00.853 --> 28:04.204
AGENT HIGHTOWER HAS BEEN
ON TOP OF A SHORT SUSPECT LIST

28:04.291 --> 28:06.685
IN THE JOHNSON MURDER
FOR SOME TIME,

28:06.772 --> 28:09.339
EVEN BEFORE
DIRECTOR BERTRAM NOTIFIED ME

28:09.426 --> 28:13.256
THAT SHE WAS ROMANTICALLY LINKED
WITH ONE OF HIS VICTIMS.

28:13.343 --> 28:15.476
NOW YOU'RE
INTO HER SEX LIFE?

28:15.563 --> 28:18.000
WOW, WHEN YOU BOYS DECIDE TO
DESTROY A WOMAN'S REPUTATION,

28:18.087 --> 28:19.610
YOU REALLY GO ALL OUT.

28:19.698 --> 28:22.135
LISBON. YOU'RE THE ONE WHO
JUST TOLD ME THE JOHNSON

28:22.222 --> 28:25.660
AND MONTERO MURDERS WERE LINKED.
NOW WE HAVE EVIDENCE.

28:25.747 --> 28:27.444
IF YOU'RE TOO CLOSE TO THIS,

28:27.531 --> 28:30.491
LET ME KNOW, AND I'LL MOVE YOU
OFF THIS INVESTIGATION.

28:30.578 --> 28:33.146
I'LL BE FINE, SIR.HIGHTOWER NEVER WENT
TO HER OFFICE.

28:33.233 --> 28:37.150
I JUST SPOKE TO HER ASSISTANT.THAT'S MY FAULT.
I LET HER WALK OUT.

28:37.237 --> 28:40.327
I DIDN'T THINK SHE WOULD RUN.WHO SAID SHE'S RUNNING?

28:40.414 --> 28:43.634
FOR ALL WE KNOW,
SHE'S IN THE LADIES ROOM.MAYBE YOU SHOULD CHECK.

28:43.722 --> 28:47.595
WE'RE GOING TO CONDUCT A SEARCH
OF AGENT HIGHTOWER'S OFFICE NOW.

28:47.682 --> 28:49.379
[beep] [Hightower]
Leave your name and number.

28:49.466 --> 28:51.904
I'll get back to you
as soon as I can.

28:51.991 --> 28:54.036
IT'S LISBON.
WHEREVER YOU ARE,

28:54.123 --> 28:57.779
DO US BOTH A FAVOR, AND CALL ME
AS SOON AS YOU GET THIS, OKAY?

29:08.877 --> 29:11.532
I CAN'T BELIEVE WE HAVE TO
GO THROUGH THE BOSS'S STUFF.

29:11.619 --> 29:12.707
SUSPECT'S A SUSPECT.

29:12.794 --> 29:14.013
[sighs]

29:14.100 --> 29:16.580
[groans]

29:16.667 --> 29:20.628
JUST FEELS SO WRONG, THOUGH.

29:20.715 --> 29:23.239
[sighs]

29:26.025 --> 29:28.288
WAIT A SECOND.

29:28.375 --> 29:29.724
THIS DRAWER'S TOO HEAVY.

29:32.553 --> 29:34.511
CHECK IT OUT.

29:34.598 --> 29:36.252
FALSE BOTTOM.

29:39.952 --> 29:41.649
THE STOLEN PENDANT.

29:41.736 --> 29:43.433
HEY, BOSS.

29:49.178 --> 29:50.310
OH, NO.

29:55.576 --> 29:57.839
SEEMS WE FOUND
YOUR MYSTERY BUYER.

29:59.885 --> 30:02.888
PUT AN IMMEDIATE B.O.L.O. OUT
ON MADELEINE HIGHTOWER.

30:02.975 --> 30:05.455
SHE'S CONSIDERED TO BE
ARMED AND DANGEROUS.

30:12.985 --> 30:13.942
[Lisbon] WHERE IS SHE?

30:14.029 --> 30:15.378
[Van Pelt] OVER HERE.

30:15.465 --> 30:16.640
[LaRoche] YOU SAW THE SUSPECT?

30:16.727 --> 30:18.555
DETAILS, PLEASE. WHERE? WHEN?

30:18.642 --> 30:20.862
I WAS COMING OUT OF
THE ELEVATOR AFTER LUNCH.

30:20.949 --> 30:23.560
WHERE WAS
THE SUSPECT HEADED?UH, UP THE STAIRS,

30:23.647 --> 30:26.128
WHICH I-I THOUGHT WAS STRANGE.
IT LEADS TO THE ROOF.

30:26.215 --> 30:28.174
NOT JUST THE ROOF.
IT'S WHERE JANE WORKS.

30:28.261 --> 30:30.480
HAS ANYBODY SEEN HIM?NOT SINCE THIS MORNING.

30:30.567 --> 30:32.526
COVER THE EXITS,
ALL OF THEM.

30:32.613 --> 30:34.441
USE WHOEVER YOU HAVE TO
OUT HERE.

30:48.585 --> 30:50.849
[door rattles]

30:50.936 --> 30:53.155
LOCKED.

30:53.242 --> 30:56.115
JANE? YOU IN THERE?

30:56.202 --> 31:00.293
[Patrick] YEAH, I'M COMING OUT.

31:00.380 --> 31:04.079
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO STAND BACK,
AND IF YOU'RE BEARING FIREARMS,

31:04.166 --> 31:06.255
PLEASE LOWER THEM.

31:06.342 --> 31:07.691
PLEASE.

31:09.519 --> 31:11.391
[clink]

31:15.308 --> 31:16.962
[door rumbling]

31:17.049 --> 31:18.572
[clank]

31:23.751 --> 31:26.232
STAND BACK, OR HE DIES.

31:30.453 --> 31:32.151
LET US PASS.

31:35.154 --> 31:39.332
IF YOU DON'T LET US PASS,
YOU CANTRY TO STOP ME,

31:39.419 --> 31:40.899
BUT JUST KNOW
THAT MY FINGER

31:40.986 --> 31:43.075
WILL REFLEXIVELY
PULL THIS TRIGGER

31:43.162 --> 31:45.164
IF I STUMBLE OR IF I FALL.

31:45.251 --> 31:46.861
AGENT HIGHTOWER.

31:46.948 --> 31:49.124
DON'T BEAT YOURSELF UP,
TERESA.

31:49.211 --> 31:52.606
THERE'S NOTHING YOU COULD
HAVE DONE TO PREVENT THIS.

31:52.693 --> 31:55.217
I GOT MYSELF INTO IT,
AND I'M GETTING MYSELF OUT,

31:55.304 --> 31:58.090
SO CLEAR A PATH.

31:58.177 --> 31:59.874
EVERYONE.

31:59.961 --> 32:03.051
LOWER YOUR WEAPONS.

32:03.138 --> 32:05.010
LET 'EM PASS.

32:05.097 --> 32:06.185
WALK.

32:06.272 --> 32:07.751
WALKING.

32:10.493 --> 32:12.843
GO AHEAD, CHO.

32:12.931 --> 32:15.281
MAKE YOUR MOVE.
WATCH HIM DIE.

32:39.305 --> 32:41.611
NOBODY MOVE.

32:41.698 --> 32:43.222
EVERYBODY JUST STAY CALM.

32:49.141 --> 32:52.231
PUT THE PHONE DOWN.

32:52.318 --> 32:55.625
PUT THE PHONE DOWN.

32:55.712 --> 32:59.673
YOU HEARD HER.
PUT THE PHONE DOWN NOW.PUT IT DOWN.

32:59.760 --> 33:01.283
OKAY...

33:01.370 --> 33:03.372
HERE'S HOW IT IS.

33:03.459 --> 33:05.809
WE'RE EXITING THE BUILDING.

33:05.896 --> 33:09.291
IF ANYONE TRIES TO STOP US,
I PULL THE TRIGGER.

33:09.378 --> 33:13.426
IF ANYONE IN HERE CALLS ANYONE
OUT THERE, I PULL THE TRIGGER.

33:13.513 --> 33:15.776
DO AS SHE SAYS.

33:15.863 --> 33:16.864
LET'S GO. MOVE!

33:22.217 --> 33:23.958
[tires screech]

33:31.139 --> 33:32.097
[tires screech]

33:37.189 --> 33:38.668
[rattling]

33:38.755 --> 33:40.453
[pounds on door]

33:45.066 --> 33:47.329
HIYA, JANE.

33:47.416 --> 33:49.723
THAT WOLF'S TOOTH
YOU GAVE MY KID?

33:49.810 --> 33:51.551
WAS A HUGE HIT.
LOOK AT THIS.

33:53.814 --> 33:55.990
HE DREW THIS.
IT'S FOR YOU.

33:56.077 --> 33:58.775
KIND OF IN A RUSH HERE, JIM.

34:03.606 --> 34:04.825
[tires screech]

34:08.481 --> 34:10.265
[shouts inaudibly]

34:19.622 --> 34:21.015
CHO, GET A CHOPPER UP

34:21.102 --> 34:23.061
AND NOTIFY EVERY
AVAILABLE CBI FIELD UNIT.

34:23.148 --> 34:24.671
I WANT VISUAL CONTACT

34:24.758 --> 34:28.153
WITH THE TARGET,
BUT MAINTAIN A SAFE DISTANCE.

34:28.240 --> 34:30.459
MY CAR. YOU DRIVE.

34:30.546 --> 34:32.374
I'M A POOR DRIVER AT SPEED.

34:35.247 --> 34:36.596
[siren wails]

34:42.341 --> 34:44.038
[tires screeching]

34:52.655 --> 34:54.831
[siren wailing]

34:54.918 --> 34:56.268
I'M SORRY.

34:56.355 --> 34:57.312
ABOUT WHAT?

34:57.399 --> 35:00.272
YOUR BOSS. YOU ADMIRE HER.

35:00.359 --> 35:03.840
THAT'S IRRELEVANT. WE NEED
TO FOCUS ON JANE'S SAFETY.

35:03.927 --> 35:05.668
[woman] All units be advised,

35:05.755 --> 35:08.149
a single-vehicle traffic
collision on North Main.

35:08.236 --> 35:10.934
Vehicle is a dark blue
late-model SUV.

35:11.021 --> 35:13.807
COPY. WE'RE EN ROUTE.
30 SECONDS OUT.

35:26.167 --> 35:27.081
WAIT FOR BACKUP.

35:27.168 --> 35:29.083
YOU WAIT.

35:29.170 --> 35:30.302
HOLD ALL ONCOMING TRAFFIC.

35:34.393 --> 35:35.568
[groans]

35:39.963 --> 35:42.488
WE'VE GOT A SUSPECT MISSING.
SET UP A 10-BLOCK PERIMETER.

35:42.575 --> 35:45.273
NOTIFY THE T.A.C. TEAM
AND CALL AN AMBULANCE.

35:45.360 --> 35:46.579
[groans]

35:46.666 --> 35:48.146
WHAT HAPPENED?

35:48.233 --> 35:51.453
SHE WAS UNWRAPPING HER HAND...

35:51.540 --> 35:53.890
THE MOMENT I WAS WAITING FOR.

35:53.977 --> 35:55.196
TO CRASH THE VEHICLE?

35:57.677 --> 35:59.940
IT SEEMED LIKE
A SMART IDEA AT THE TIME.

36:02.464 --> 36:04.423
THEY THINK JANE
MAY HAVE A CONCUSSION.

36:04.510 --> 36:06.947
THEY'VE TAKEN HIM
TO THE HOSPITAL FOR A CT SCAN.

36:07.034 --> 36:08.949
I'M JUST THANKFUL
HE'S GONNA BE OKAY.

36:09.036 --> 36:11.995
AND WHERE ARE WE AT
WITH OUR MANHUNT?WE HAVE PERIMETER TEAMS

36:12.082 --> 36:14.694
DEPLOYED AROUND THE COMMAND POST
FOR 16 CITY BLOCKS.

36:14.781 --> 36:18.524
U.S. MARSHALS HAVE JOINED
THE HUNT. SO'S THE FBI.

36:18.611 --> 36:21.091
THEY PUT HIGHTOWER
ON THEIR "MOST WANTED" LIST.

36:21.179 --> 36:23.746
SUCH A TRAGIC TURN OF EVENTS.

36:23.833 --> 36:26.053
LOOK, THERE ARE WORSE THINGS
THAT COULD HAPPEN HERE

36:26.140 --> 36:28.490
THAN WE HAVE
AN OPEN-AND-SHUT CASE.

36:28.577 --> 36:31.450
IT'S A BLEMISH, TO BE SURE,
BUT AT LEAST WE CAN

36:31.537 --> 36:34.931
CLOSE THE BOOK
ON THIS UGLY CHAPTER AT CBI.

36:35.018 --> 36:37.673
"AND WHEN THY LITTLE HEART
DOTH WAKE,

36:37.760 --> 36:40.981
THEN THE DREADFUL NIGHT
SHALL BREAK."

36:41.068 --> 36:42.548
WHAT'S THAT?

36:42.635 --> 36:45.203
AH, IT'S JUST A--
AN OLD POEM I LIKE.

36:51.252 --> 36:53.211
WILLIAM BLAKE, I BELIEVE.

37:00.566 --> 37:02.872
[speaking inaudibly]

37:02.959 --> 37:05.962
[door creaks]

37:06.049 --> 37:07.834
WHY AREN'T YOU ANSWERING
YOUR CELL PHONE?

37:07.921 --> 37:08.878
IS IT RINGING?

37:08.965 --> 37:10.445
FOR TWO HOURS.

37:10.532 --> 37:13.187
I'M SORRY.
I THOUGHT IT WAS MY BRAIN.

37:13.274 --> 37:14.971
DOCTOR SAID
IT'S TO BE EXPECTED.

37:15.058 --> 37:18.018
OF ALL PEOPLE TO USE
TO EFFECT HER ESCAPE,

37:18.105 --> 37:20.412
WHY WOULD HIGHTOWER
CHOOSE YOU?

37:20.499 --> 37:23.719
THEORETICALLY SPEAKING,
I THINK IT MAKES PERFECT SENSE.

37:23.806 --> 37:26.722
I'M ISOLATED IN THE RAFTERS,
I DON'T CARRY A WEAPON,

37:26.809 --> 37:30.900
AND I DON'T KNOW ANY OF THAT...
HAND-TO-HAND COMBAT JIVE.

37:30.987 --> 37:33.642
I DON'T WANT THEORIES.
I WANT FACTS.

37:33.729 --> 37:35.296
WHY WOULD SHE COME TO YOU?

37:35.383 --> 37:38.386
YOU DON'T...
HONESTLY BELIEVE...

37:38.473 --> 37:39.953
THAT I HAD ANYTHING TO DO

37:40.040 --> 37:41.650
WITH HIGHTOWER'S ACTIONS
TONIGHT, DO YOU?

37:41.737 --> 37:43.478
I HONESTLY DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO BELIEVE,

37:43.565 --> 37:45.828
BUT WHENEVER YOU'RE IN
THE MIDDLE OF SOMETHING,

37:45.915 --> 37:49.745
I HAVE REASON TO DOUBT.
AND I LIKE HIGHTOWER.

37:49.832 --> 37:51.704
WHEN IN DOUBT, DON'T.

37:51.791 --> 37:53.619
WELL...

37:53.706 --> 37:56.274
WHATEVER HAPPENED TONIGHT,
I'M GLAD YOU'RE SAFE.

37:56.361 --> 37:58.058
THANK YOU. HEY.

38:00.669 --> 38:04.064
THANK YOU FOR COMING
TO MY RESCUE.

38:04.151 --> 38:08.242
I GUESS I SHOULD EXPRESS
MY APPRECIATION TO HERRLaROCHE.

38:08.329 --> 38:10.288
IS HE STILL OUT
COMMANDING THE TROOPS?

38:10.375 --> 38:13.682
NO. HE WENT HOME
FOR THE NIGHT.

38:46.976 --> 38:48.587
[raps on door]

38:59.032 --> 39:00.033
JANE?

39:00.120 --> 39:01.643
LaROCHE.

39:01.730 --> 39:04.690
YOU HAVE A FLUFFY
WHITE DOG AND AN ENTIRE...

39:04.777 --> 39:10.173
HOUSE.
ARE THOSE HUMMEL FIGURINES?

39:10.260 --> 39:11.566
YEAH.

39:11.653 --> 39:13.960
YOU FIND THAT AMUSING?

39:14.047 --> 39:17.616
WELL, I JUST DIDN'T PICTURE
YOU LIVING IN AN ACTUAL HOUSE.

39:17.703 --> 39:19.879
WHERE DID YOU THINK I LIVED?

39:19.966 --> 39:22.229
IN A BURROW ON A RIVERBANK.
SOMEWHERE LIKE THAT.

39:28.757 --> 39:31.499
WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU, JANE?

39:31.586 --> 39:33.153
YOU ALREADY DID FOR ME.

39:33.240 --> 39:35.111
YOU LET HIGHTOWER
EXIT THE BUILDING

39:35.198 --> 39:37.157
INSTEAD OF SHOOTING ME
IN THE BRAIN STEM,

39:37.244 --> 39:40.813
AND FOR THAT, I'M THANKFUL.

39:40.900 --> 39:42.815
HOW'D YOU KNOW
I DRINK SCOTCH?

39:42.902 --> 39:44.207
YOU DO?

39:46.862 --> 39:48.081
THANK YOU.

39:48.168 --> 39:49.909
IT'S MY PLEASURE.

39:49.996 --> 39:52.868
IT'S TOO BAD SHE GOT AWAY,
THOUGH, HUH? HIGHTOWER.

39:52.955 --> 39:55.654
PERIMETER WILL REMAIN IN FORCE
UNTIL WE FIND HER.

39:55.741 --> 39:58.178
MAY TAKE A DAY OR TWO,
BUT WE'LL FIND HER.

39:58.265 --> 39:59.484
SHE CAN'T ESCAPE.

39:59.571 --> 40:02.487
OH, SHE'S ESCAPED.
I KNOW IT.

40:02.574 --> 40:04.532
JUST LIKE YOU KNEW I WAS WRONG

40:04.619 --> 40:06.795
ABOUT HIGHTOWER'S
CAPACITY FOR MURDER?

40:06.882 --> 40:10.016
THAT'S THE COUNTERPUNCH.
LANDED IT.

40:10.103 --> 40:12.410
ARE WE KIDS OR WHAT?

40:12.497 --> 40:14.412
YES.

40:14.499 --> 40:15.587
WE ARE KIDS.

40:18.198 --> 40:20.592
WELL, GOODNIGHT, JANE.

40:20.679 --> 40:22.507
IT IS A GOOD NIGHT.

40:40.394 --> 40:43.528
[trunk unlocks]

40:43.615 --> 40:45.138
DID IT WORK?
[whispers] RIGHT.

40:45.225 --> 40:46.139
[whispers] YES, IT DID.

40:46.226 --> 40:49.098
DID IT WORK? OKAY.

40:49.185 --> 40:51.971
I CAN'T BELIEVE
IT WORKED.

40:52.058 --> 40:53.276
IT WILL WORK.

40:53.363 --> 40:54.582
THIS IS CRAZY.

40:54.669 --> 40:56.671
NOT AT ALL.
ONCE THEY SET THE PERIMETER,

40:56.758 --> 40:58.978
YOU WILL BE LIKE
A RABBIT IN A TRAP.

40:59.065 --> 41:00.719
THEY WILL SEARCH
EVERY VEHICLE LEAVING

41:00.806 --> 41:04.287
EXCEPT THE CAR OF THE MAN THAT
IS IN CHARGE, SO HURRY, GET IN.

41:04.374 --> 41:07.377
OKAY. ALRIGHT. HOW LONG--HOW
LONG DO I HAVE TO BE IN HERE?

41:07.465 --> 41:09.728
UNTIL YOU HEAR THIS.[knocks rhythmically]

41:09.815 --> 41:12.644
OKAY.TURN YOUR CELL PHONE OFF
SO THEY CAN'T TRACE.

41:12.731 --> 41:15.168
HERE. TAKE MINE.OKAY.

41:15.255 --> 41:16.996
WHISPER.ALRIGHT.

41:17.083 --> 41:19.477
HERE'S YOUR CELL PHONE.DID YOU MAKE ARRANGEMENTS?

41:19.564 --> 41:20.913
I TALKED TO MY SISTER.

41:21.000 --> 41:23.219
SHE'S WAITING FOR ME
OUTSIDE TOWN WITH MY KIDS.

41:23.306 --> 41:25.352
PERFECT. YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO
COMPLETELY VANISH BECAUSE

41:25.439 --> 41:27.920
IF RED JOHN FINDS OUT WHERE
YOU ARE, HE'LL COME.

41:28.007 --> 41:31.271
SHE HAS A CABIN IN SARATOGA.
CAN WAIT THERE FOR A FEW MONTHS.

41:31.358 --> 41:33.969
PERFECT. HE'LL THINK
HE WON THIS ROUND.RED JOHN HAS

41:34.056 --> 41:36.537
A INSIDER AT THE CBI
WHO FRAMED ME FOR MURDER.

41:36.624 --> 41:38.713
IT'S SAFE TO SAY
HE WON THIS ROUND.

41:38.800 --> 41:41.716
YES, BUT NOW I HAVE
THE ADVANTAGE.

41:41.803 --> 41:44.980
WITH YOU GONE, WHOEVER IT IS
THAT WORKS FOR RED JOHN

41:45.067 --> 41:49.115
WILL START TO RELAX, AND THUS
LEAD ME STRAIGHT TO HIM.

41:49.202 --> 41:51.509
YOU RISKED A LOT FOR ME.

41:51.596 --> 41:54.512
WELL, NOT FOR YOU ENTIRELY.

41:54.599 --> 41:56.992
I UNDERSTAND. STILL...

41:57.079 --> 41:59.255
THANK YOU FOR GETTING ME
OUT OF THAT BUILDING

41:59.342 --> 42:01.040
AND BACK TO MY FAMILY.

42:01.127 --> 42:03.608
AND THANK YOU FOR NOT
SHOOTING ME IN THE FACE.

42:03.695 --> 42:07.176
NO ONE CAN KNOW ABOUT THIS. THIS
HAS TO STAY BETWEEN YOU AND ME.

42:07.263 --> 42:08.961
YOU SHOULD TELL LISBON
WHAT'S GOING ON--

42:09.048 --> 42:13.879
NOBODY. HE'S TOO SMART THAT WAY.
HE'LL SENSE A TRAP.

42:13.966 --> 42:17.404
I'M BETTER OFF ALONE.

42:17.491 --> 42:20.015
NOBODY IS BETTER OFF ALONE.

42:35.814 --> 42:37.293
STAY TUNED FOR SCENES
FROM OUR NEXT EPISODE.
