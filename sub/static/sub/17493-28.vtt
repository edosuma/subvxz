# Sarah and Duck
QUACK!

00:04.160 --> 00:06.000
# Sarah and Duck
QUACK!

00:07.360 --> 00:09.360
# Sarah and Duck
QUACK!

00:11.320 --> 00:13.200
# Sarah and Duck. #
QUACK!

00:15.960 --> 00:20.000
It's morning,
and Sarah is just about waking up.

00:21.040 --> 00:23.880
Morning, Sarah.
SHE GROANS SLEEPILY

00:23.880 --> 00:26.400
Oh. Not a very good night's sleep?

00:26.400 --> 00:30.160
SHE GROANS
I can see why. That pillow's looking

00:30.160 --> 00:31.560
rather flat.

00:31.560 --> 00:33.640
Pancake pillow.

00:33.640 --> 00:36.360
SHE YAWNS
Looks like we need to get you

00:36.360 --> 00:37.760
a new one.

00:37.760 --> 00:41.200
SLEEPILY: I just...get dressed.

00:41.200 --> 00:42.240
Good idea.

00:45.000 --> 00:48.200
DUCK SNORES
Duck! New pillow.

00:48.200 --> 00:49.840
QUACK, QUACK

00:49.840 --> 00:51.480
YAWNING: Wake up.

00:51.480 --> 00:52.760
HE QUACKS SOFTLY

00:54.360 --> 00:56.840
Morning. SHALLOTS: Morning!

00:56.840 --> 00:58.320
DUCK QUACKS SLEEPILY

00:58.320 --> 00:59.800
Wake up!

00:59.800 --> 01:03.080
Your pillow pancaked too, eh, chap?

01:03.080 --> 01:06.040
Just plain old sleepy Duck.

01:06.040 --> 01:08.080
Sleepy Duck.

01:08.080 --> 01:11.520
Oh, hello, you two.
Where are you off to?

01:11.520 --> 01:13.360
Hello, Scarf Lady.

01:13.360 --> 01:15.680
Pillow's gone pancake.

01:15.680 --> 01:18.760
We're off to buy some new
ones from the big shop.

01:18.760 --> 01:24.680
Oh, don't buy them! Make your own
pancakes. Pillows, not pancakes!

01:24.680 --> 01:25.720
Huh!

01:25.720 --> 01:28.520
You just need a bit of
extra fluff and puff.

01:28.520 --> 01:31.480
Ooh. Fluff and... Precisely!

01:31.480 --> 01:35.640
You come round to my house later
and we'll see about those pillows.

01:35.640 --> 01:40.400
Don't forget to bring
your duvet covers! Pillowcases!

01:40.400 --> 01:44.280
OK! Right, then. Breakfast?
QUACK, QUACK!

01:44.280 --> 01:45.480
Uh-huh.

01:56.320 --> 01:57.400
KNOCKING

01:59.480 --> 02:01.720
Oh, hello. Hello.

02:01.720 --> 02:04.480
You're a bit early
for the fluffs and puffs.

02:04.480 --> 02:08.040
But we can have a bite to eat
in the kitchen while we wait.

02:08.040 --> 02:09.400
Sounds good to me.

02:11.480 --> 02:13.600
Wow!

02:13.600 --> 02:15.440
Rather cosy, eh?

02:15.440 --> 02:17.800
Mm. Go on, take a seat.

02:24.200 --> 02:25.760
QUACK

02:25.760 --> 02:29.120
SARAH GIGGLES
Here, try these. Ooh.

02:29.120 --> 02:30.160
Puffy.

02:31.800 --> 02:33.200
QUACK!

02:36.120 --> 02:38.520
Mmm. Lovely.

02:38.520 --> 02:41.840
Psst. Oh! Do an old bag a favour.

02:44.000 --> 02:45.520
Oh! Sorry, Bag.

02:48.760 --> 02:52.200
No! Not in there. Oh!

02:59.480 --> 03:01.160
Enjoyed those, did we?

03:01.160 --> 03:02.800
WITH MOUTH FULL: Yup.

03:04.120 --> 03:05.680
DUCK QUACKS SOFTLY

03:07.280 --> 03:11.160
Duck kisses. It's almost time.
Hop down, you two,

03:11.160 --> 03:13.760
and ready those pillowcases.

03:13.760 --> 03:14.800
BAG GASPS

03:14.800 --> 03:15.920
QUACK!

03:15.920 --> 03:18.720
Oh...bag straps.

03:18.720 --> 03:20.520
WIND WHOOSHES

03:25.600 --> 03:28.800
Ah, perfect. Now, watch this.

03:30.920 --> 03:34.480
Oh! Ooh! What are you... Er...

03:34.480 --> 03:36.360
QUACK, QUACK

03:39.240 --> 03:41.480
Gosh!

03:41.480 --> 03:44.440
There, see? Night puffs.

03:44.440 --> 03:46.880
Would you look at that?

03:46.880 --> 03:48.560
Now, watch closely.

03:50.680 --> 03:53.360
Wow! Woohoo!
BAG: Whoa!

03:55.320 --> 03:56.880
Now you try.

03:58.840 --> 04:00.280
SHE GROANS

04:00.280 --> 04:01.720
Whoa!

04:04.680 --> 04:05.800
QUACK

04:10.200 --> 04:12.200
Come on, you two. Huh?

04:13.320 --> 04:16.520
Alley-oop! Careful!

04:17.920 --> 04:20.480
Well, what are you waiting for?

04:20.480 --> 04:22.440
SHE GIGGLES
Come on, Duck.

04:23.760 --> 04:27.840
Woohoo!
Gotcha, you little fluff puff!

04:27.840 --> 04:29.400
SARAH LAUGHS

04:35.880 --> 04:39.200
Ooh, night puffs. How pretty.

04:39.200 --> 04:42.760
Woohoo! BAG: Couldn't you
have just gone to the shops?!

04:42.760 --> 04:44.920
Quickly! Over here, you two.

04:48.960 --> 04:51.360
Hello, Donkey.
DONKEY BRAYS

04:55.200 --> 04:56.680
QUACK!

04:57.840 --> 05:00.040
Need to get to higher ground.

05:05.680 --> 05:08.280
Oh, thank goodness.

05:08.280 --> 05:12.320
Ready? Uh-huh.
One, two, three, and jump!

05:14.360 --> 05:16.200
Jump!

05:16.200 --> 05:18.640
Woo! Gotcha.

05:18.640 --> 05:19.880
Gotcha.

05:21.880 --> 05:23.480
Go on, Duck.
QUACK

05:31.120 --> 05:32.680
QUACK!

05:32.680 --> 05:33.720
Ooh!

05:34.760 --> 05:36.800
Not to worry, Duck, dear.

05:38.880 --> 05:42.160
Let's try again.
QUACK, QUACK!

05:42.160 --> 05:44.960
Moon? Way ahead of you.

05:46.120 --> 05:48.920

06:16.960 --> 06:19.320
Ooh. Good one, Duck.

06:21.640 --> 06:24.560
Better? Uh-huh.

06:24.560 --> 06:26.240
SHE YAWNS

06:27.840 --> 06:31.320
Ooh, hello.
I've got just the place for you.

06:32.640 --> 06:36.560
Hey! What do you think...
Ooh, actually, it's quite...nice.

06:36.560 --> 06:38.040

06:38.040 --> 06:40.800
Goodnight, dears. Night-night.
