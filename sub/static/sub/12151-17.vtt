00:59.317 --> 01:01.724
It doesn't make sense.

01:02.195 --> 01:06.030
-He wouldn't take Angel's child.
GUNN: He did.

01:06.243 --> 01:08.615
It's Wesley. Why would he do that?

01:08.871 --> 01:11.327
-We find him, we'll ask.
-lf Angel finds him--

01:11.499 --> 01:14.868
He'll kill him, and we won't
be able to ask.

01:18.048 --> 01:23.970
I should stay here in case he comes
back. You go find Angel before--

No toothbrush, no razor, no Mossberg

01:31.440 --> 01:33.646
He wouldn't betray us.

And he wouldn't leave without
saying something to me...

a hell of an urgent reason!

find it there.

01:44.539 --> 01:46.578
Where are his diaries?

01:46.749 --> 01:50.333
-He kept diaries.
-They're not here or at the office.

01:50.504 --> 01:54.668
Which is where we should be going
to get a heads up on Angel.

01:56.137 --> 01:59.340

GUNN: We gotta find him.

he would've the first 40 times.

up to Holtz and handed over Connor?

They'd been meeting secretly.
I read that before Wesley attacked me.

06:12.487 --> 06:14.197

for a stroll, Charles.

I did have a gun to my head.

Yes, I know.
I'm sorry that happened.

08:23.187 --> 08:26.888

to the Quor-toth...

08:27.150 --> 08:29.190

...you'd have Connor's blood
on your hands.

39:36.075 --> 39:37.618
-Don't I anyway?
-No.

39:37.827 --> 39:42.207
Think you could have done more?
You did everything you could...

39:42.793 --> 39:45.997
...with the knowledge you had,
just like Wesley.

39:48.175 --> 39:54.011
Maybe the way to start forgiving
yourself is by starting to forgive him.

Yeah. They did?
And? And, okay, where?

40:07.739 --> 40:11.155
Yeah, he's right here.
I'll tell him.

40:11.410 --> 40:13.118
Okay, thanks.

40:13.913 --> 40:15.159

40:24.258 --> 40:25.290
GUNN:
Hey.

40:25.468 --> 40:27.508
It's good you came, man.

40:28.638 --> 40:31.094
-He ask for me?
-He can't speak yet.

40:31.350 --> 40:35.564
Trachea's messed up, lost a lot
of blood. It's good you came.

40:36.274 --> 40:39.027
He's not completely
out of the woods yet.

40:39.194 --> 40:42.148
You being here can only help.

40:42.781 --> 40:44.193
Can I see him?

40:45.493 --> 40:47.533
I'm sure he'd like that.

Hey, Wes.

41:27.211 --> 41:29.038
I just....

41:30.673 --> 41:34.719
I want you to know that
I understand why you did it.

41:34.928 --> 41:37.550
I know about the prophecies...

41:37.765 --> 41:41.432
...and I know how hard it must
have been for you to...

41:42.813 --> 41:45.055
...do what you did.

41:45.274 --> 41:49.901
You thought I was going to turn evil
and kill my son. I didn't.

41:51.448 --> 41:53.440
It's important you know that.

41:53.700 --> 41:57.830
This isn't Angelus talking.
It's me, Angel.

41:59.500 --> 42:01.576
You know that, right?

42:06.174 --> 42:07.632
Good.

42:09.469 --> 42:12.755
Son of a bitch! You're gonna pay!
You took my son!
