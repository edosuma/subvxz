00:02.750 --> 00:04.289
You are being watched.

00:04.290 --> 00:06.419
The government has a secret system...

00:06.420 --> 00:08.249
secret system...

00:08.250 --> 00:11.879
A system you asked for to keep you safe.

00:11.880 --> 00:16.289
A machine that spies on
you every hour of every day.

00:16.290 --> 00:19.209
You granted it the
power to see everything...

00:19.210 --> 00:24.039
to index, order, and control
the lives of ordinary people.

00:24.040 --> 00:27.289
The government considers
these people irrelevant.

00:27.290 --> 00:28.919
We don't.

00:28.920 --> 00:31.829
But to it, you are all irrelevant,

00:31.830 --> 00:35.329
victim or perpetrator,
if you stand in its way.

00:35.330 --> 00:36.890
We'll find you.

00:44.830 --> 00:46.589
Don't worry.

00:48.170 --> 00:49.999
No fast ones today.

00:50.000 --> 00:52.289
You say that every time.

00:52.290 --> 00:54.619
It's not like I'm gonna
spill a glass of water

00:54.620 --> 00:57.209
on the nightstand, stomp on your foot,

00:57.210 --> 00:59.410
throw an elbow to your chin,
and stick with that sedative.

01:08.290 --> 01:09.752
Oops.

01:10.140 --> 01:11.679
I think I skipped a step.

01:31.310 --> 01:33.589
- Better call the boss.
- No need.

01:34.060 --> 01:35.758
When will she ever learn?

01:36.020 --> 01:38.280
- Grab the fire axe.
- Got it.

01:40.640 --> 01:41.957
It's gone.

01:52.390 --> 01:54.780
Clear.

01:56.600 --> 01:58.305
She's not here.

02:44.560 --> 02:47.019
Our number is sure in a hurry
to get somewhere, Finch.

02:47.020 --> 02:49.139
International businessman like James Ko

02:49.140 --> 02:51.179
is in high demand these days.

02:51.180 --> 02:54.139
Stanford MBA, fluent in Mandarin.

02:54.140 --> 02:57.309
He negotiates contracts between
US and British corporations

02:57.310 --> 02:59.969
and their Chinese manufacturers.

02:59.970 --> 03:02.139
A man who knows how to cross borders.

03:02.140 --> 03:06.929
Indeed, he was returning from
Hong Kong en route to the UK,

03:06.930 --> 03:11.229
but his flight was diverted into
New York for maintenance issues.

03:11.230 --> 03:12.559
According to his calendar,

03:12.560 --> 03:15.139
Ko was supposed to be in London
tomorrow afternoon,

03:15.140 --> 03:16.519
so why did he leave the airport,

03:16.520 --> 03:19.139
and what the hell is he doing
in this neighborhood?

03:19.140 --> 03:20.229
Hold on a second, Finch.

03:20.230 --> 03:21.453
Ko just switched his SIM card.

03:21.454 --> 03:22.929
Hello?

03:22.930 --> 03:24.139
Where are you?

03:24.140 --> 03:25.769
I'm in New York,
booked on the next flight out.

03:25.770 --> 03:27.559
Just have to take care
of that errand first.

03:27.560 --> 03:30.139
Well, make it quick
and don't miss that plane.

03:30.140 --> 03:33.099
I'll make it, sir.

03:33.100 --> 03:34.643
Between the SIM card switching

03:34.644 --> 03:38.019
and Ko's tight grip
on whatever's in his briefcase,

03:38.020 --> 03:39.929
I don't like the looks of this, Finch.

03:39.930 --> 03:42.099
Stay close, Mr. Reese.

03:42.100 --> 03:45.309
Any new developments
from the simulations, Harry?

03:45.310 --> 03:47.040
Unfortunately,

03:47.864 --> 03:50.511
it has yet to render a positive outcome.

03:51.060 --> 03:54.229
You mean the Machine's
lost every hypothetical

03:54.230 --> 03:56.059
round to Samaritan.

03:56.060 --> 03:57.976
As you no doubt predicted.

03:58.730 --> 04:02.179
Perhaps we should try altering
one of the variables,

04:02.180 --> 04:04.009
for the sake of humanity...

04:05.060 --> 04:07.179
or even just us.

04:07.180 --> 04:09.559
I'll take that under advisement.
Thank you, Ms. Groves.

04:09.560 --> 04:12.952
Sooner or later,
every ecosystem changes.

04:13.970 --> 04:16.870
It just requires the correct precursor.

04:34.770 --> 04:37.599
Dr. Mason to the emergency room.

04:37.600 --> 04:40.559
Bad news, Finch.
Our number just checked into the ER.

04:40.560 --> 04:42.242
The emergency room? What happened?

04:43.100 --> 04:44.580
He's sick.

04:46.180 --> 04:47.923
Looks like the only thing
he's about to kill

04:47.924 --> 04:48.849
is a box of Kleenex.

04:48.850 --> 04:51.969
So he was just trying
to locate the closest hospital?

04:51.970 --> 04:53.571
I guess so.

04:53.869 --> 04:56.179
And from the look of things,
we're gonna be a while.

04:56.180 --> 04:57.620
I'll get back to you.

05:01.230 --> 05:03.536
Can never get this damn thing to work.

05:05.430 --> 05:07.519
Are we out of antivirals?

05:07.520 --> 05:09.599
Now that we've joined the 21st century

05:09.600 --> 05:11.929
and connected to the National
Health Care Database,

05:11.930 --> 05:16.349
a few clicks, and voilÃ .

05:16.350 --> 05:18.160
They just arrived.

05:21.100 --> 05:23.317
What do you know?

05:24.970 --> 05:26.780
Database is right for once.

05:27.390 --> 05:28.634
Thanks.

05:30.020 --> 05:31.349
Yo, Doc, what the hell?

05:31.350 --> 05:32.679
We've been waiting over an hour.

05:32.680 --> 05:34.893
Yeah, what's your problem?

05:36.180 --> 05:37.599
I've seen worse cat scratches.

05:37.600 --> 05:38.809
What you talking about?

05:38.810 --> 05:42.164
Quit your whining, or I'll have Paulie
give you a real reason to be here.

05:45.770 --> 05:47.351
What do we got here?

05:47.970 --> 05:50.679
Mid-grade fever, cough, sore throat.

05:50.680 --> 05:52.179
Look, Doc, no offense,

05:52.180 --> 05:54.139
but I don't have time
to be sick; I have...

05:54.140 --> 05:55.429
Yeah, I know. I know.

05:55.430 --> 05:57.192
Who's not busy, huh?

05:58.390 --> 06:00.120
Okay, open.

06:03.140 --> 06:04.519
Well, lucky for you,

06:04.520 --> 06:06.303
I happen to be
the hospital's epidemiologist.

06:06.304 --> 06:08.049
Looks like you're coming down
with the flu.

06:09.020 --> 06:11.559
You traveled outside
of the country recently?

06:11.560 --> 06:12.588
No.

06:13.180 --> 06:15.099
We can give you an antiviral
to help your immune system

06:15.100 --> 06:16.269
fight off the infection.

06:16.270 --> 06:17.733
Hang out for about an hour to ensure

06:17.734 --> 06:18.969
you don't have a reaction,

06:18.970 --> 06:20.433
and then afterwards, fluid and rest.

06:20.434 --> 06:22.169
Sure thing, Doc. Thanks.

06:23.020 --> 06:24.513
Sleeve, please.

06:26.100 --> 06:28.179
Finch, the Machine got this one wrong.

06:28.180 --> 06:30.577
Ko's been treated,
and he's about to be released.

06:30.930 --> 06:32.393
I'm gonna head back to the precinct.

06:32.394 --> 06:34.849
The Machine doesn't point us
toward sick people, Mr. Reese.

06:34.850 --> 06:36.349
If we received Ko's number,

06:36.350 --> 06:38.229
he's either a victim or a perpetrator,

06:38.230 --> 06:40.160
so keep a close watch.

06:50.020 --> 06:52.849
Jeff, how are you were able
to get a reservation here?

06:52.850 --> 06:55.269
I've been trying to get one
for my boss for months.

06:55.270 --> 06:57.349
Made some new connections.

06:57.350 --> 06:59.769
You always said I should get
out of my shell more.

07:00.890 --> 07:03.019
Looks like a lot
in your life has changed.

07:03.020 --> 07:05.630
Still the same guy you fell
in love with at Jimmie Cone.

07:06.270 --> 07:07.976
Haven't lost your charm.

07:08.970 --> 07:11.389
So who are you working for, again?

07:11.390 --> 07:13.679
A new company.

07:13.680 --> 07:14.785
What are you doing?

07:15.430 --> 07:19.429
Sort of a jack-of-all-trades.

07:19.430 --> 07:21.573
Well, it's good to see
you've gotten your act together

07:21.574 --> 07:23.929
since getting out.

07:23.930 --> 07:25.099
Sir?

07:25.100 --> 07:26.769
I've read that a lot of ex-convicts

07:26.770 --> 07:28.416
have trouble readjusting.

07:29.640 --> 07:31.423
Well, you'd have just
waited a little longer,

07:31.424 --> 07:33.469
you could've seen
those changes firsthand.

07:33.470 --> 07:36.139
I think seven years was long
enough to wait for a boyfriend

07:36.140 --> 07:37.769
I knew for a few months in high school.

07:37.770 --> 07:39.519
I was 17.

07:39.520 --> 07:41.099
They tried me as an adult.

07:41.100 --> 07:43.099
You weren't 17
when you stabbed another inmate

07:43.100 --> 07:45.410
and 7 years turned into 12.

07:49.270 --> 07:51.059
So tell me, Jeff,

07:51.060 --> 07:53.910
what guarantee do I have
that you won't do it again?

07:58.180 --> 08:00.309
The hard times are behind us.

08:00.310 --> 08:03.969
Yeah, I got a great job,
a really nice apartment.

08:03.970 --> 08:06.240
We can get a fresh start...

08:08.100 --> 08:10.196
Make up for lost time.

08:11.930 --> 08:14.269
I'm happy for you, Jeff. I really am.

08:14.270 --> 08:16.559
But I've done the math.

08:16.560 --> 08:18.059
Three out of every four convicts

08:18.060 --> 08:20.229
get rearrested within five years.

08:20.230 --> 08:22.780
I'm sorry, but I can't
go through that again.

08:38.600 --> 08:40.729
Is that the way you greet
the guy who saved your life?

08:40.730 --> 08:42.519
Can't be too careful these days.

08:42.520 --> 08:44.740
World has changed, Detective.

08:46.350 --> 08:48.256
That's why I came to talk to you.

08:49.430 --> 08:51.099
A dozen bodies.

08:51.100 --> 08:52.776
And who knows how many more.

08:53.560 --> 08:54.849
Someone's knocking off people

08:54.850 --> 08:57.059
and burying those bodies
underground in tunnels.

08:57.060 --> 08:58.608
They almost took me with it.

08:59.100 --> 09:00.889
Wish I could help you, Detective,

09:00.890 --> 09:02.512
but I'm out of that game.

09:04.890 --> 09:07.019
Wish I could say the same
for your friends,

09:07.020 --> 09:08.728
because one of the bodies down there

09:10.020 --> 09:12.200
belonged to
your business partner, Bruce.

09:20.970 --> 09:23.179
And who's behind this?

09:23.180 --> 09:24.900
That's what I want to know.

09:25.680 --> 09:28.099
I figure they must be using
trucks to deliver the explosives

09:28.100 --> 09:29.856
that demolished those tunnels.

09:30.560 --> 09:32.213
I've looked all over the city...

09:32.520 --> 09:34.729
nothing official
anywhere near that location.

09:34.730 --> 09:36.519
Trucks, as in construction?

09:36.520 --> 09:38.349
You got contacts in that business.

09:38.350 --> 09:40.349
Trucks are about to be hijacked,

09:40.350 --> 09:42.300
trucks that are rented off the books.

09:42.810 --> 09:46.099
I share information,
I expect it to flow both ways.

09:46.100 --> 09:47.588
You'll know what I know.

09:48.180 --> 09:49.179
There's a guy, Capello,

09:49.180 --> 09:51.929
runs a transportation outfit
in the Bronx.

09:51.930 --> 09:53.969
No truck enters
or leaves the Five Burroughs

09:53.970 --> 09:55.059
without his knowledge.

09:55.060 --> 09:56.563
All right, thanks. I'll let you know.

09:56.564 --> 09:58.268
Be careful out there, Detective.

09:59.020 --> 10:01.280
The threat can come from anywhere.

10:09.810 --> 10:12.761
John, any update on Mr. Ko?

10:13.930 --> 10:16.120
Yeah, he's just checking out of the ER.

10:24.180 --> 10:26.269
Doc, we got a problem.

10:26.270 --> 10:28.280
Can we get a little help here?

10:30.310 --> 10:31.559
He's not breathing, no pulse.

10:31.560 --> 10:32.716
Defib!

10:39.060 --> 10:40.570
Clear.

10:43.350 --> 10:45.910
- Nothing.
- Clear.

10:48.060 --> 10:49.450
Nothing.

10:51.180 --> 10:52.469
We lost him.

10:52.470 --> 10:54.679
This doesn't make any sense.

10:54.680 --> 10:57.389
The onset rate is off the charts,

10:57.390 --> 11:00.139
and flu doesn't cause
hemorrhaging from the mouth.

11:00.632 --> 11:03.179
Finch, we got a problem. Ko just died.

11:03.180 --> 11:04.559
Oh, no.

11:04.560 --> 11:06.063
I don't know what made this guy sick,

11:06.064 --> 11:08.519
but whatever he had
looks pretty damn lethal.

11:24.808 --> 11:27.278
It's locked. - Let's check this way.

11:35.058 --> 11:36.368
What the hell?

11:41.558 --> 11:43.102
Hey, fellas.

11:44.308 --> 11:45.887
You mind telling me where the hell I am?

11:45.888 --> 11:48.142
Jo'burg, South Africa.

11:48.678 --> 11:51.017
Johannesburg. That's not an island.

11:51.018 --> 11:53.137
No, it's more like hell.

11:53.138 --> 11:56.057
- We're not done with you yet.
- But first things first.

11:56.058 --> 11:59.382
We should introduce ourselves
to this little lassie.

12:00.018 --> 12:02.017
I sure could use that fire axe.

12:06.348 --> 12:08.057
Nice one.

12:08.058 --> 12:09.807
You really should ask
for better bunk mates.

12:09.808 --> 12:12.137
This place is like
some twisted social experiment

12:12.138 --> 12:13.977
in violence.

12:13.978 --> 12:17.017
Yeah, being a guinea pig sucks.

12:17.018 --> 12:19.238
Enough small talk... where's the exit?

12:21.098 --> 12:24.927
There's only one way in or out,

12:24.928 --> 12:28.717
and they only open for meals
or discipline.

12:28.718 --> 12:31.213
I never was big on prison grub.

12:46.978 --> 12:48.557
Not sure what we're dealing with here.

12:48.558 --> 12:49.887
It could be a new flu strain.

12:49.888 --> 12:52.597
You and Garcia get a blood
sample to the lab ASAP,

12:52.598 --> 12:54.717
and find out where Mr. Ko came from.

12:54.718 --> 12:56.677
Either he didn't give us
the whole story,

12:56.678 --> 12:58.387
or he just had the most
allergic reaction

12:58.388 --> 13:00.217
to antivirals known to man.

13:00.218 --> 13:03.097
Garcia, if this is some kind
of mix-up with the meds,

13:03.098 --> 13:05.281
it better not be another one
of your computer glitches.

13:05.282 --> 13:07.427
The database reduces human errors.

13:07.428 --> 13:10.408
Just pray your malpractice
insurance is up-to-date.

13:11.478 --> 13:12.977
You, start wiping this place down

13:12.978 --> 13:14.717
anywhere the patient went or touched.

13:14.718 --> 13:16.177
Okay.

13:16.178 --> 13:17.977
Excuse me.

13:17.978 --> 13:20.597
Detective Riley, NYPD. Can I help?

13:20.598 --> 13:22.198
We've already got security.

13:23.678 --> 13:26.267
Suppose we could use a little help.

13:26.268 --> 13:28.057
Standard protocol is,
we lock this place down

13:28.058 --> 13:29.807
until we know what we're dealing with.

13:29.808 --> 13:30.884
Sure thing, Doc.

13:30.885 --> 13:32.177
Last time we had an outbreak
of swine flu here,

13:32.178 --> 13:33.807
we lost three patients...

13:33.808 --> 13:36.097
two gunshot wounds and a stabbing.

13:36.098 --> 13:39.118
They turned on each other once
they heard it was contagious.

13:41.308 --> 13:44.097
Did she just say "contagious"?

13:44.098 --> 13:46.677
NYPD. We need to lock this place down.

13:46.678 --> 13:47.977
Grab the ambulance bay doors.

13:47.978 --> 13:49.267
I'll get the other entrances.

13:49.268 --> 13:51.017
Roger, 10-4, I'm on it.

13:51.018 --> 13:54.503
Wait, under what authority
can we stop people from leaving?

13:55.138 --> 13:56.977
The PATRIOT Act.

13:56.978 --> 13:58.948
Nice.

14:08.808 --> 14:09.745
Wait.

14:10.218 --> 14:11.307
I thought you could use some help,

14:11.308 --> 14:12.677
given that any number of people

14:12.678 --> 14:13.927
could be the perpetrator.

14:13.928 --> 14:16.177
Dr. Mason may be mistaken.

14:16.178 --> 14:17.927
Ko might've been poisoned.

14:17.928 --> 14:19.347
Or someone intentionally triggered

14:19.348 --> 14:21.057
a severe allergic reaction.

14:21.058 --> 14:23.257
Which means the killer
may still be inside.

14:23.888 --> 14:25.671
Root's running background
checks on everyone.

14:25.672 --> 14:28.512
Meantime, best if we do
some investigating ourselves.

14:30.098 --> 14:31.767
You sure you want to be in here?

14:31.768 --> 14:34.017
Whatever killed Ko could be spreading.

14:34.018 --> 14:36.618
Then let's be sure to take precautions.

14:43.558 --> 14:45.767
Where can I find Detective Foosco?

14:45.768 --> 14:47.195
Fusco. Over here.

14:47.808 --> 14:49.443
Mind explaining this?

14:50.308 --> 14:52.331
One of your trucks
didn't have a permit for driving

14:52.332 --> 14:53.427
through a residential area.

14:53.428 --> 14:55.017
Since when did NYPD detectives

14:55.018 --> 14:57.177
get involved with parking violations?

14:57.178 --> 14:58.801
You should feel lucky
I'm only citing you

14:58.802 --> 15:00.677
for your official operations.

15:00.678 --> 15:02.558
That's the only type I run.

15:03.598 --> 15:05.158
Not according to Carl Elias.

15:07.978 --> 15:09.739
Carl Elias is dead.

15:10.348 --> 15:12.948
Maybe, but I ain't.

15:15.058 --> 15:16.387
How can I help you, Detective?

15:16.388 --> 15:18.411
Let's talk about some
truck rentals in the vicinity

15:18.412 --> 15:20.158
of some underground tunnels,

15:20.978 --> 15:23.387
the kind that require
a commercial driver's license.

15:23.388 --> 15:25.517
What people do
with the trucks is on them.

15:25.518 --> 15:26.677
I'm not involved.

15:26.678 --> 15:28.420
I want to see a list of your drivers.

15:29.178 --> 15:31.387
Thought that's where this was headed.

15:31.388 --> 15:32.887
Whatever you think of the trucks,

15:32.888 --> 15:34.977
the licenses are legit.

15:34.978 --> 15:36.308
Take a look.

15:46.978 --> 15:48.507
This guy.

15:49.928 --> 15:51.252
Thanks.

15:51.928 --> 15:55.118
I'll assume the rest of the
citations will be taken care of.

15:59.638 --> 16:00.717
RTCC.

16:00.718 --> 16:02.477
Yes, Detective Fusco over at the 8th.

16:02.478 --> 16:04.661
I need you to run a commercial
driver's license for me.

16:04.662 --> 16:07.057
15400685.

16:07.058 --> 16:08.347
Got it, one second.

16:08.348 --> 16:10.887
Looking for an address, phone,
vehicle, anything you got.

16:10.888 --> 16:12.347
blue four-door sedan,

16:12.348 --> 16:16.116
New York plate Mike-Bravo-Echo 3-1-5.

16:16.598 --> 16:18.097
All right, I want you to get it
out to all our plate readers.

16:18.098 --> 16:19.517
Call me as soon as we pick it up.

16:19.518 --> 16:21.368
Will do.

16:28.348 --> 16:31.198
What's so urgent
that you had to meet today?

16:32.978 --> 16:35.655
I'm having second thoughts
about the job.

16:36.058 --> 16:37.517
Things have been escalating,

16:37.518 --> 16:39.597
and I know how this ends:

16:39.598 --> 16:43.057
me in prison, just another statistic.

16:43.058 --> 16:44.387
Really?

16:44.388 --> 16:45.807
How so?

16:45.808 --> 16:47.831
Well, you started me out
as a driver hauling people

16:47.832 --> 16:50.807
around in a van,
delivering supplies in a truck.

16:50.808 --> 16:52.347
Next thing you know,

16:52.348 --> 16:55.637
I'm tailing a guy who's being
protected by an NYPD detective.

16:55.638 --> 16:57.847
City's had its fair share
of corrupt cops.

16:57.848 --> 16:59.111
Yeah, dirty cops are one thing.

16:59.112 --> 17:00.887
Dead girl's another.

17:00.888 --> 17:02.887
You have me breaking into an apartment,

17:02.888 --> 17:04.017
stealing a hard drive,

17:04.018 --> 17:06.847
and looking down the barrel
of some crazy woman,

17:06.848 --> 17:08.137
tells me I'm a cog in a wheel

17:08.137 --> 17:10.679
just working for
something called Samaritan?

17:12.218 --> 17:15.144
Unfortunately, Jeff,
there are people in this world...

17:15.558 --> 17:18.807
very confused people...
who want to impede progress.

17:18.808 --> 17:20.330
Progress of what?

17:20.768 --> 17:23.287
And who do I work for exactly?

17:23.848 --> 17:26.176
We help make life better for people.

17:26.178 --> 17:27.977
Just look how your life has changed.

17:27.978 --> 17:29.847
Three months ago,
you were painting houses

17:29.848 --> 17:33.057
for minimum wage,
an ex-con no one would hire.

17:33.058 --> 17:35.847
Now you can afford
to take your ex-girlfriend

17:35.848 --> 17:37.057
to a fancy restaurant.

17:37.058 --> 17:38.177
How did you know...

17:38.178 --> 17:39.809
You're up for a promotion, Jeff.

17:45.348 --> 17:46.557
I don't know.

17:46.558 --> 17:48.068
One more job.

17:48.978 --> 17:52.818
Then if you want to quit, you can.

17:56.058 --> 17:57.629
What's the job?

17:58.518 --> 18:00.618
It requires an exam.

18:14.638 --> 18:16.927
How much longer are you gonna
keep us locked in here?

18:16.928 --> 18:18.578
My daughter's scared to death.

18:21.018 --> 18:23.017
I understand your frustration, ma'am.

18:23.018 --> 18:24.640
Please just be patient.

18:25.308 --> 18:27.477
I'm gonna look
into the antiviral injection

18:27.478 --> 18:29.088
that they gave Mr. Ko.

18:30.018 --> 18:32.097
How much longer?
The natives have grown restless.

18:32.098 --> 18:34.561
Until we get the lab results and
know what we're dealing with,

18:34.562 --> 18:36.097
I can't take any chances.

18:36.098 --> 18:37.977
If this is a flu virus,

18:37.978 --> 18:39.887
I've never seen one this aggressive.

18:39.888 --> 18:41.017
Roger that.

18:41.018 --> 18:42.597
You may have to replace a few kneecaps,

18:42.598 --> 18:44.625
but no one's leaving this place.

18:45.518 --> 18:47.465
Yo, check this out.

18:47.848 --> 18:49.591
Officials have locked down

18:49.592 --> 18:52.017
a local area hospital
because of a suspicious death.

18:52.018 --> 18:53.767
According to an unnamed source,

18:53.768 --> 18:57.387
the cause of death may be
a highly pathogenic virus.

18:57.388 --> 18:59.267
Oh, hell no.

18:59.268 --> 19:01.177
That's how the zombie apocalypse starts.

19:01.178 --> 19:02.847
I don't care who gets infected;

19:02.848 --> 19:04.238
we're out of here.

19:06.808 --> 19:08.104
Out of my way.

19:14.178 --> 19:16.807
Hey, Finch, Paulie's no Root.

19:16.808 --> 19:19.177
But it looks like we have
a reliable partner.

19:19.178 --> 19:21.057
If we're gonna get to
the bottom of Ko's death,

19:21.058 --> 19:23.177
we need all the help that we can get.

19:33.428 --> 19:35.427
Miss Groves,
I'm sending you the lot number

19:35.428 --> 19:37.977
from Mr. Ko's antiviral injection.

19:37.978 --> 19:39.988
We need to determine where it came from.

19:41.308 --> 19:42.467
Got it.

19:42.848 --> 19:45.818
The open system can track down
the package's origins.

19:47.478 --> 19:50.097
I'll try to figure out
who's behind this.

19:50.098 --> 19:53.330
Harry, be sure to wash your hands often

19:53.558 --> 19:55.218
and Bear's paws.

19:55.718 --> 19:58.847
You're not supposed to
be back here, I think, Mr....

19:58.848 --> 20:00.057
Professor Whistler.

20:00.058 --> 20:02.097
Professor Whistler,
you and your comfort dog

20:02.098 --> 20:04.977
would be better off helping
people out there stay calm.

20:04.978 --> 20:06.177
Good idea.

20:06.178 --> 20:08.078
Come on, Bear.

20:18.768 --> 20:20.562
Ko's blood work just came in.

20:21.138 --> 20:22.984
H5N1.

20:23.598 --> 20:24.847
Oh, no.

20:24.848 --> 20:26.097
What?

20:26.098 --> 20:28.977
Ko was already infected with
avian flu before he arrived.

20:28.978 --> 20:31.267
Bird flu... you suspected as much.

20:31.268 --> 20:32.477
That's what killed him?

20:32.478 --> 20:34.767
No, blood work indicates
that we injected him

20:34.768 --> 20:36.597
with live human flu virus.

20:36.598 --> 20:38.017
What? How could that happen?

20:38.018 --> 20:40.017
I don't know, but we just
combined two flu viruses

20:40.018 --> 20:42.557
and turned a deadly one
into a very contagious one.

20:42.558 --> 20:44.097
What are we dealing with here, Doc?

20:44.098 --> 20:47.017
Avian flu kills 60% of people
within 72 hours.

20:47.018 --> 20:48.677
Combined with human flu virus,

20:48.678 --> 20:51.057
which has a transmission
of ten to one, that means...

20:51.058 --> 20:52.977
For every one person who gets it,

20:52.978 --> 20:55.137
ten more people will become infected.

21:04.718 --> 21:06.658
We're at ground zero of an outbreak.

21:18.520 --> 21:20.769
Hey, look,
how did he get out of his cell?

21:20.770 --> 21:22.437
All guards report.

21:27.270 --> 21:28.702
Stop right there.

21:35.400 --> 21:38.189
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
You might need this.

21:38.190 --> 21:39.309
You're not coming with?

21:39.310 --> 21:41.099
I still got a job to do.

21:41.862 --> 21:42.849
A job?

21:42.850 --> 21:45.153
Friends I can't leave behind.

21:45.520 --> 21:47.121
I can respect that.

21:47.400 --> 21:48.519
Samuel.

21:48.520 --> 21:49.899
Sameen.

21:49.900 --> 21:52.540
Look, man, if you're ever
in New York, look me up.

22:03.140 --> 22:05.559
An update on the ongoing situation

22:05.560 --> 22:07.899
inside a local area hospital.

22:07.900 --> 22:10.559
The CDC has ordered a strict quarantine,

22:10.560 --> 22:14.189
and NYPD has set up a cordon
outside the hospital

22:14.190 --> 22:18.059
after diagnosing a new
highly pathogenic flu strain.

22:18.060 --> 22:19.809
Any official statements yet?

22:19.810 --> 22:22.689
The governor has put
the National Guard on alert.

22:22.690 --> 22:24.309
Mr. Ko was infected, waylaid,

22:24.310 --> 22:26.769
and turned into a potential
weapon of mass destruction,

22:26.770 --> 22:28.059
but why here?

22:28.060 --> 22:29.729
The Machine gave us his number.

22:29.730 --> 22:32.309
If Ko's the weapon,
then who's the target?

22:32.310 --> 22:35.189
Now we have to confine
the outbreak, locate a remedy,

22:35.190 --> 22:37.019
figure out who's behind this and why.

22:37.020 --> 22:38.729
I'll stay close to Doc Mason,

22:38.730 --> 22:41.383
see if she can provide us
with any clues.

22:41.791 --> 22:44.559
The lab sent Ko's test results
over to the CDC.

22:44.560 --> 22:45.979
Until they can analyze the virus

22:45.980 --> 22:47.809
and locate an effective antiviral,

22:47.810 --> 22:49.399
we'll have to provide for ourselves.

22:49.400 --> 22:50.769
How do we slow it down?

22:50.770 --> 22:53.059
We keep a small batch
of antivirals for avian flu

22:53.060 --> 22:54.899
in the emergency preparedness stock room

22:54.900 --> 22:56.729
on the other side of the ER.

22:56.730 --> 22:58.899
It's no cure, but it can boost
the immune system

22:58.900 --> 23:00.809
of someone who's infected.

23:04.520 --> 23:07.099
Oh, man.

23:07.100 --> 23:08.439
We'll have to act fast.

23:08.440 --> 23:10.139
I know the stock room.

23:10.140 --> 23:12.139
- I'll retrieve the antivirals.
- Antivirals?

23:12.140 --> 23:14.139
I arrived here first. I call dibs.

23:14.140 --> 23:16.939
No, man, we was here before you.

23:16.940 --> 23:18.559
Listen, I was here first.

23:18.560 --> 23:20.809
Okay, you're gonna need an escort.

23:20.810 --> 23:24.099
Take Paulie and this guy with
the dog to get the antivirals.

23:24.100 --> 23:25.660
Be quick, but don't hurry.

23:30.400 --> 23:31.769
Grab every mask you can find.

23:31.770 --> 23:33.620
We're gonna need them all.

23:38.270 --> 23:39.689
You never told me this promotion

23:39.690 --> 23:41.059
depended on a check-up.

23:41.060 --> 23:43.439
Congratulations, Jeff. You passed.

23:43.440 --> 23:45.439
What? How is that possible?

23:45.440 --> 23:47.099
I've been waiting here for 45 minutes.

23:47.100 --> 23:48.809
The doctor hasn't even shown up yet.

23:48.810 --> 23:50.809
Oh, we've had your medical
information for months

23:50.810 --> 23:52.139
from your prison physical.

23:52.140 --> 23:54.848
The visit to the infirmary
for appendicitis?

23:55.190 --> 23:56.484
Then why am I here?

23:56.850 --> 23:59.818
The drawer in front of you... open it.

24:10.020 --> 24:11.139
Don't worry.

24:11.140 --> 24:13.019
They're not for you.

24:13.020 --> 24:16.059
Make your way to the ER
and await further instructions.

24:16.060 --> 24:18.689
If I get stopped,
people are gonna ask questions.

24:18.690 --> 24:19.939
It's not gonna be a problem.

24:19.940 --> 24:21.849
Most of the hospital's been evacuated.

24:21.850 --> 24:23.527
It's under quarantine.

24:24.190 --> 24:25.335
Quarantine?

24:26.020 --> 24:28.910
I need you to make your way
to the ER now.

24:31.560 --> 24:33.431
What the hell is going on?

24:34.190 --> 24:35.769
Am I gonna get infected?

24:35.770 --> 24:37.189
You'll be fine.

24:37.190 --> 24:38.599
I'm sure of it.

24:46.140 --> 24:48.000
Bingo.

24:52.480 --> 24:54.200
Come on through.

24:57.480 --> 24:59.189
Detective Fusco with the 8th.

24:59.190 --> 25:00.309
Got a real nightmare here.

25:00.310 --> 25:02.573
I need you to close the gap
of that perimeter over there.

25:02.574 --> 25:03.661
I'm on it.

25:13.980 --> 25:16.290
Come on. There's got to be something.

25:18.060 --> 25:21.269
Next time, steal meds that work.

25:21.270 --> 25:24.475
Where are the hell are you
with those antivirals, Finch?

25:25.400 --> 25:28.000
Hang on. We're almost there.

25:30.350 --> 25:31.599
We'll watch the door.

25:31.600 --> 25:33.938
Suit yourself. We'll be right back.

25:35.400 --> 25:37.769
Miss Groves, any updates?

25:37.770 --> 25:40.099
I used the open system
to track down the shipments

25:40.100 --> 25:42.599
of antivirals
that were injected into Ko.

25:42.600 --> 25:44.639
Both the antivirals and a shipment

25:44.640 --> 25:47.559
of live human flu virus
from a research facility

25:47.560 --> 25:51.019
were rerouted to a lab in Albany
that has since shut its doors.

25:51.020 --> 25:53.139
Someone at the lab
must've switched them.

25:53.140 --> 25:54.479
So Dr. Mason was right.

25:54.480 --> 25:58.099
They injected Ko
with live human flu virus.

25:58.100 --> 26:00.689
And since he was already
infected with avian flu,

26:00.690 --> 26:03.099
they accidentally created a superflu.

26:03.100 --> 26:06.019
So who benefits
from creating an outbreak?

26:06.020 --> 26:09.979
About that... I had the Machine
analyze Ko's blood sample.

26:09.980 --> 26:12.559
She ran through 5 trillion
possible combinations

26:12.560 --> 26:14.979
of human flu and avian flu strains,

26:14.980 --> 26:17.729
and only one resulted
in the proper re-assortment

26:17.730 --> 26:20.139
of chromosomes that would've
produced the lethal virus

26:20.140 --> 26:21.269
that killed James Ko.

26:21.270 --> 26:22.769
5 trillion.

26:22.770 --> 26:25.849
There's only one other entity
capable of performing

26:25.850 --> 26:28.729
that caliber
of sophisticated calculation.

26:28.730 --> 26:30.347
Samaritan.

26:31.140 --> 26:32.309
I think I know why.

26:32.310 --> 26:34.769
I hacked the hospital's email servers.

26:34.770 --> 26:37.689
Both Dr. Mason
and Nurse Carol filed complaints

26:37.690 --> 26:41.519
with Admin Garcia about errors
in the new health care database.

26:41.520 --> 26:44.309
Mason went so far as to allege
the deliberate manipulation

26:44.310 --> 26:46.269
of her diagnoses and prescriptions.

26:46.270 --> 26:49.349
Samaritan has been manipulating
the entire health care system

26:49.350 --> 26:51.059
through the database.

26:51.060 --> 26:53.769
It's created the outbreak
to target the three people

26:53.770 --> 26:55.399
with direct knowledge of its actions,

26:55.400 --> 26:58.019
but surely an outbreak is overkill.

26:59.480 --> 27:01.059
Oh, no.

27:01.060 --> 27:02.950
Miss Groves, I'll get back to you.

27:08.600 --> 27:10.073
Don't move.

27:11.310 --> 27:13.410
No, please, we need those antivirals.

27:18.770 --> 27:21.099
You just destroyed our only
chance at fighting the virus.

27:21.100 --> 27:24.200
No, I just ushered in the future.

27:36.473 --> 27:38.682
This is station three. No sight of her.

27:44.593 --> 27:46.113
Hold it.

27:50.052 --> 27:52.381
I can't quite grasp why you even bother,

27:52.382 --> 27:55.181
knowing this is just another simulation.

27:55.182 --> 27:56.761
Well, this axe I lifted last month

27:56.762 --> 27:58.950
when I took out two of your orderlies...

27:59.722 --> 28:01.091
it feels pretty real to me.

28:01.092 --> 28:02.551
You must be exhausted,

28:02.552 --> 28:05.381
this never-ending desire to escape,

28:05.382 --> 28:08.261
even from a prison
made entirely of pixels.

28:08.262 --> 28:11.080
Well, if this is just another
simulation, then prove it.

28:11.842 --> 28:14.011
Shoot yourself in the head.

28:14.012 --> 28:15.381
Why?

28:15.382 --> 28:17.881
Just to make the programmers reboot?

28:17.882 --> 28:20.011
Why would Greer build
a Stanford Prison Experiment

28:20.012 --> 28:22.881
inside my head, in South Africa no less?

28:22.882 --> 28:25.631
Is this just another one
of your lame arguments

28:25.632 --> 28:29.609
to convince me
that Samaritan is the good ASI?

28:30.182 --> 28:32.586
This isn't Greer's idea at all.

28:33.262 --> 28:36.381
The simulations are built
on your memories.

28:36.382 --> 28:38.221
Don't you recall your mission
to South Africa?

28:38.222 --> 28:41.341
You killed a Somali bomb maker
in this very prison.

28:41.342 --> 28:42.881
Sneaked into the same cell

28:42.882 --> 28:46.652
via the same route, through the wall.

28:49.922 --> 28:53.841
That's not true.
I was never in South Africa.

28:53.842 --> 28:55.692
I was in Germany.

29:00.632 --> 29:03.369
And a lot of other countries, but...

29:04.382 --> 29:06.381
You're lying.
I was never in South Africa.

29:06.382 --> 29:09.881
After 7,000 simulations,
it's only logical

29:09.882 --> 29:12.971
that some of your old memories
have been replaced by new ones.

29:12.972 --> 29:16.091
Now the two coexist side by side.

29:16.092 --> 29:17.511
For example,

29:17.512 --> 29:21.192
I'm sure you can recall
killing your friend John Reese.

29:25.972 --> 29:27.921
Just as I'm sure
you can remember murdering

29:27.922 --> 29:30.112
an innocent scientist.

29:37.182 --> 29:40.009
I had no way of knowing
that wasn't a simulation.

29:40.512 --> 29:43.942
Reality denied comes back to haunt.

29:46.422 --> 29:49.152
You're not sure of anything
anymore, are you?

29:52.012 --> 29:53.881
Everything will be fine.

29:53.882 --> 29:55.145
Any second now, the technicians

29:55.146 --> 29:57.707
will come in and remove
your VR head set,

29:58.092 --> 30:00.049
and you'll wake up.

30:01.342 --> 30:02.945
You're right.

30:05.132 --> 30:07.112
This is all just a dream.

30:14.182 --> 30:18.181
But I just really had
to get that out of my system.

30:18.182 --> 30:20.131
Oh, quit with all the drama.

30:20.132 --> 30:21.921
Any second now, Greer will reboot,

30:21.922 --> 30:24.301
and you will be just fine.

30:24.302 --> 30:28.921
But until then,
why not a little joy ride?

31:06.722 --> 31:08.131
I get it now.

31:08.132 --> 31:09.721
The syringes are the cure.

31:09.722 --> 31:11.421
Unfortunately, no.

31:11.422 --> 31:13.841
The syringes are
an insurance policy, Jeff.

31:13.842 --> 31:17.051
Insurance policy?
What... what's inside of it?

31:17.052 --> 31:19.681
Blood sample from a patient
that passed away this morning

31:19.682 --> 31:20.921
in the ER.

31:20.922 --> 31:22.841
Never made it out of the hospital.

31:22.842 --> 31:24.971
So what do you expect me to do
with these?

31:24.972 --> 31:27.072
Open the envelope.

31:31.342 --> 31:32.971
Those are your targets.

31:32.972 --> 31:34.862
One needle each.

31:41.762 --> 31:44.301
No, I can't...
I can't kill those people.

31:44.302 --> 31:46.011
I'd be killing not only them
but the people

31:46.012 --> 31:47.862
they're trying to save.

31:52.762 --> 31:53.921
Whose prints are those?

31:53.922 --> 31:55.801
They were collected by police last week

31:55.802 --> 31:58.221
at the scene of an armed robbery.

31:58.222 --> 32:01.011
Remember your house painting partner?

32:01.012 --> 32:02.681
He was arrested,

32:02.682 --> 32:05.801
but an unknown accomplice
left fingerprints at the scene,

32:05.802 --> 32:09.301
which may or may not match yours.

32:09.302 --> 32:12.471
I suggest you carry out
your mission, but don't worry.

32:12.472 --> 32:14.341
The police won't discover fingerprints

32:14.342 --> 32:18.091
or any other forensic evidence
at this scene.

32:18.092 --> 32:19.942
What's it gonna be, Jeff?

32:43.382 --> 32:45.306
Who are you working for?

32:45.722 --> 32:47.421
I don't work for anyone.

32:47.422 --> 32:49.245
It's no accident
that you and your therapy dog

32:49.246 --> 32:50.761
ended up in the ER.

32:50.762 --> 32:52.761
That tall cop working with you...

32:52.762 --> 32:54.511
- Sir...
- Someone must be backing you.

32:54.512 --> 32:57.221
and it can't be the people
who recognize my potential

32:57.222 --> 32:59.051
and offered me a healthy pension.

32:59.052 --> 33:02.921
You've doomed us all
by destroying those antivirals.

33:02.922 --> 33:06.268
To the contrary,
I'm gonna save all of you.

33:06.972 --> 33:09.921
You have any idea
how many people die in the U.S.

33:09.922 --> 33:11.921
every year from medical errors

33:11.922 --> 33:13.341
caused by humans?

33:13.342 --> 33:15.681
400,000.

33:15.682 --> 33:17.511
It's the third leading cause of death

33:17.512 --> 33:19.631
after heart disease and cancer.

33:19.632 --> 33:23.631
All these antiquated doctors
and nurses standing in the way,

33:23.632 --> 33:25.471
misdiagnosis,

33:25.472 --> 33:27.267
human fallibility...

33:27.552 --> 33:29.162
they're the disease.

33:29.592 --> 33:31.381
Automation is the cure.

33:32.922 --> 33:34.281
Go ahead and take that.

33:35.472 --> 33:37.652
Let's find out who your employer is.

33:41.882 --> 33:43.881
- Hello?
- Actually, he's correct.

33:43.882 --> 33:46.921
It is your boss,
and she has a message for you:

33:46.922 --> 33:50.072
Aanval and ethylene oxide.

33:53.262 --> 33:54.471
Aanval.

33:54.472 --> 33:56.091
It's Dutch, Harry.

33:56.092 --> 33:58.421
Bear, aanval!

34:05.302 --> 34:06.681
What the hell happened?

34:06.682 --> 34:08.011
He destroyed the antivirals.

34:08.012 --> 34:09.261
Why did you do that?

34:09.262 --> 34:10.841
You can't stop what's coming.

34:10.842 --> 34:12.971
Here, keep an eye on him.

34:12.972 --> 34:14.518
I have to go tell the others.

34:15.552 --> 34:17.130
Miss Groves, the hospital administrator

34:17.132 --> 34:18.721
destroyed the antivirals.

34:18.722 --> 34:20.091
He's a Samaritan plant.

34:20.092 --> 34:22.051
Took an ASI to create this virus,

34:22.052 --> 34:24.380
and now it's gonna
take another one to cure it.

34:24.382 --> 34:25.880
Hang in there, Harry.

34:25.882 --> 34:27.811
She's working on something.

34:28.222 --> 34:30.261
Oh, come on.

34:30.262 --> 34:32.261
I have faith in you.

34:42.012 --> 34:44.051
That's my girl.

34:55.842 --> 34:57.761
- Stop!
- Got you.

35:23.972 --> 35:25.761
Lionel, I told you to stay out of this.

35:25.762 --> 35:27.549
Go after him.

35:28.512 --> 35:30.741
Help, my arm.

35:41.422 --> 35:43.471
Sorry, Doc, but I can't let you...

35:50.609 --> 35:52.609
_

36:01.706 --> 36:02.806
Let her through.

36:08.998 --> 36:11.190
CDC just arrived.

36:11.918 --> 36:13.377
That guy who stabbed Carroll,

36:13.378 --> 36:15.337
could he be spreading the virus?

36:15.338 --> 36:17.457
He's an escapee from a psych ward,

36:17.458 --> 36:19.877
subject of an ongoing investigation.

36:19.878 --> 36:21.375
We'll track him down.

36:22.838 --> 36:25.957
Thank you for saving my life.

36:25.958 --> 36:28.848
We'd have lost a lot more if
it wasn't for you, Doc.

36:34.298 --> 36:36.797
Busy night at the CDC, Miss Martin?

36:36.798 --> 36:38.877
Not as busy as yours.

36:38.878 --> 36:41.747
New antivirals from the lab
at Mount Sinai.

36:41.748 --> 36:43.011
How do we know these will work?

36:43.012 --> 36:45.917
A clever virologist figured it out.

36:45.918 --> 36:47.398
Thank you.

36:48.958 --> 36:50.297
The Machine?

36:50.298 --> 36:52.247
She diagnosed the new flu strain,

36:52.248 --> 36:54.377
then located an effective antiviral

36:54.378 --> 36:57.297
at a nearby lab in the midst
of a double-blind trial.

36:57.298 --> 36:59.747
Strangely, the lab just
experienced a break-in

36:59.748 --> 37:03.747
right after
an unannounced CDC inspection.

37:03.748 --> 37:06.567
The advantages of an open system.

37:07.248 --> 37:09.354
Point made.

37:09.708 --> 37:12.297
What the hell are we gonna do
about Jeff Blackwell?

37:12.298 --> 37:13.917
The Machine warned us of him months ago

37:13.918 --> 37:15.377
by giving us his number.

37:15.378 --> 37:16.957
Samaritan went to great lengths

37:16.958 --> 37:20.622
to cover up its manipulation
of the health care database.

37:21.208 --> 37:23.707
I can't help but think
we're missing something.

37:23.708 --> 37:25.917
We keep losing numbers, Finch.

37:25.918 --> 37:28.957
Not to mention the ones
we never get, buried in tunnels.

37:28.958 --> 37:31.837
And this outbreak...
it could've killed thousands.

37:31.838 --> 37:33.978
Including my partner.

37:49.998 --> 37:52.457
What happened? You get fired?

37:52.458 --> 37:53.917
Reassigned.

37:53.918 --> 37:57.377
New partner, new desk upon request.

37:57.378 --> 37:59.037
You asked for a new partner?

37:59.038 --> 38:01.797
Time I work with somebody
who appreciates me.

38:01.798 --> 38:04.337
Shares information
instead of keeping secrets.

38:04.338 --> 38:06.797
I told you this is for your own good.

38:06.798 --> 38:08.797
That nurse at the hospital,

38:08.798 --> 38:10.917
she ended up
with permanent kidney damage.

38:10.918 --> 38:12.221
It was a one-sided conversation,

38:12.222 --> 38:13.423
in case you've forgotten.

38:14.798 --> 38:16.938
Did Elias help you track down Jeff?

38:19.128 --> 38:20.997
You know how I found him?

38:20.998 --> 38:23.470
I'm a detective. That's how.

38:23.958 --> 38:25.707
Do me a favor.

38:25.708 --> 38:27.998
Don't tell me not to do my job.

38:29.038 --> 38:31.337
Find a new partner.

38:47.588 --> 38:50.417
Harold, to what do I owe the privilege?

38:50.418 --> 38:52.457
Did you speak to Detective Fusco?

38:52.458 --> 38:54.667
I hope the good detective is okay.

38:54.668 --> 38:57.417
He is now, no thanks to you.

38:57.418 --> 38:59.667
Perhaps if you had told me
about my friend Bruce's death,

38:59.668 --> 39:01.877
I wouldn't have had
to resort to other sources.

39:01.878 --> 39:03.421
I didn't tell you because I was afraid

39:03.422 --> 39:05.247
you would seek retribution.

39:05.248 --> 39:07.497
There are powerful forces in play.

39:07.498 --> 39:09.563
You don't have to tell me, Harold.

39:10.498 --> 39:13.277
I have a scar on my chest to prove it.

39:13.588 --> 39:15.337
But a little advice:

39:15.338 --> 39:18.435
a leader enlists
all his resources in war,

39:18.436 --> 39:19.627
not just his favorites.

39:19.628 --> 39:21.428
This is a battle best fought alone.

39:21.429 --> 39:22.747
John and I can handle it,

39:22.748 --> 39:24.297
and I'd appreciate it in the future

39:24.298 --> 39:26.978
if you would leave
Detective Fusco out of this.

39:28.668 --> 39:31.380
Some time ago, you gave me a book,

39:31.958 --> 39:33.837
advice for these troubled times.

39:33.838 --> 39:36.018
I would like to return the favor.

39:39.918 --> 39:42.037
War requires sacrifices.

39:42.038 --> 39:44.127
I'll bear that in mind.

39:44.128 --> 39:45.747
You know what your problem is, Harold?

39:45.748 --> 39:48.061
No, tell me.

39:48.538 --> 39:50.301
Underneath all that intellect,

39:50.326 --> 39:52.330
you're the darkest of all of us.

39:53.668 --> 39:56.638
It's always the quiet ones
we need to be afraid of.

39:59.708 --> 40:00.877
I just hope I'm not around

40:00.878 --> 40:03.808
the day that pot finally boils over.

40:06.918 --> 40:08.808
I'm afraid you're mistaken.

40:17.878 --> 40:19.467
I failed.

40:20.378 --> 40:23.297
I was only able
to reach one of the targets.

40:23.298 --> 40:24.837
No worries.

40:24.838 --> 40:26.768
The mission was a success.

40:29.168 --> 40:30.668
I don't get it.

40:31.298 --> 40:33.320
How does your arm feel, Jeff?

40:33.878 --> 40:35.247
A little sore?

40:35.248 --> 40:37.086
Am I gonna get sick?

40:37.418 --> 40:39.747
Do you know why you were selected?

40:39.748 --> 40:42.487
Because of your genetic markers.

40:43.248 --> 40:47.199
You're what scientists call
an elite controller.

40:47.588 --> 40:49.398
Elite controller?

40:51.498 --> 40:55.247
Some elite controllers contract
HIV but never develop AIDS.

40:55.248 --> 40:57.207
Others are immune to Ebola.

40:57.208 --> 40:58.707
Your genetic markers ensure

40:58.708 --> 41:01.917
that you will never contract
any strain of avian flu.

41:01.918 --> 41:04.377
This is why you selected me
for this mission.

41:04.378 --> 41:06.997
That and the survival skills
you demonstrated in prison.

41:06.998 --> 41:08.997
Why kill that doctor and nurse?

41:08.998 --> 41:11.417
Sometimes you have to
throw out a few rotten apples

41:11.418 --> 41:12.587
to save the lot.

41:12.588 --> 41:14.417
How many apples?

41:14.418 --> 41:17.898
And who gets to decide
who stays and who goes? You?

41:19.798 --> 41:21.797
After the news broke
of a deadly outbreak,

41:21.798 --> 41:24.457
the CDC recommended everyone get tested

41:24.458 --> 41:26.747
so the government could
identify those who need

41:26.748 --> 41:30.837
to be vaccinated by evaluating
their genetic markers.

41:30.838 --> 41:32.511
Next.

41:33.588 --> 41:35.377
They're collecting everyone's DNA.

41:35.378 --> 41:37.917
After 9/11, people were
more than willing to allow

41:37.918 --> 41:40.457
the NSA to collect
all of their personal data

41:40.458 --> 41:42.167
as long as it kept them safe,

41:42.168 --> 41:44.917
and now everyone will be safe
from another threat.

41:44.918 --> 41:49.417
Only this time, it will be
disease instead of terrorism.

41:49.418 --> 41:52.627
And what do you plan to do
with all this data?

41:52.628 --> 41:54.207
We're going to ensure that everyone

41:54.208 --> 41:57.287
has the same opportunity as you, Jeff.

41:58.168 --> 42:01.087
The opportunity to live up
to their full potential.

42:01.088 --> 42:02.627
It's a simple calculation:

42:02.628 --> 42:03.707
once everyone's DNA

42:03.708 --> 42:06.207
is stored in the national
health care database,

42:06.208 --> 42:09.877
then they just need to be... sorted.

42:09.878 --> 42:11.632
Sorted.

42:12.088 --> 42:14.377
In order to accomplish what?

42:14.378 --> 42:17.478
To get us through the next
great filter, of course.

42:19.878 --> 42:21.910
What filter is that?

42:22.588 --> 42:24.808
Our own savage history.

43:00.798 --> 43:02.377
More top stories

43:02.378 --> 43:03.837
at the top of the next hour.

43:03.838 --> 43:06.667
And from America,
yesterday in New York City,

43:06.668 --> 43:09.587
the sudden appearance
of an exotic new flu strain

43:09.588 --> 43:12.537
caused a mass panic
and sent citizens scrambling

43:12.538 --> 43:14.087
to get tested for a new vaccine.

43:14.088 --> 43:17.417
The outbreak has reportedly
been contained.

43:17.418 --> 43:18.747
South African health officials

43:18.748 --> 43:21.305
have yet to respond to the news.
