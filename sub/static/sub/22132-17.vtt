well like any journey one step at a time
right

14:01.210 --> 14:05.170
well you got an axe or something

14:10.929 --> 14:13.929
yeah

14:14.528 --> 14:17.528
yeah

14:21.509 --> 14:23.490
kidding me

14:23.490 --> 14:26.490
it's our traditional way ok

14:29.159 --> 14:33.629
are you know backing up that context
some people think that a tradition

14:33.629 --> 14:39.600
starts with black & decker but uh hey
it's just me so this is the deal then

14:42.730 --> 14:47.528
the deal wait wait wait wait wait wait

14:48.100 --> 14:56.050
that is the second step the first step
is to ask permission and to apologize to

14:56.049 --> 14:57.159
the tree

14:57.159 --> 15:00.159
we're taking its life

occurred that we already had our first

16:02.539 --> 16:03.198
date

16:03.198 --> 16:06.828

be considered a first date yes where you

22:31.180 --> 22:33.500
yeah

22:33.500 --> 22:34.519

22:34.519 --> 22:37.519
sure

22:55.240 --> 22:58.240
yeah

23:26.779 --> 23:29.779
yeah

23:31.410 --> 23:34.410
yeah

23:40.140 --> 23:43.200
yeah

23:43.200 --> 23:46.200
yeah

23:48.160 --> 23:51.160
yeah

23:53.929 --> 23:56.929
yeah

24:03.148 --> 24:22.108
this tree will make a beautiful canoe

24:23.729 --> 24:27.119
there's gotta be some better haul ass
out with ya

24:27.118 --> 24:33.868
there probably is but then will you
still appreciate the core its strength

24:34.409 --> 24:39.929
the coal gives nothing cake honey every
piece must be earned

24:39.929 --> 24:43.528
great another lesson of course

24:43.528 --> 24:51.118
and what is the lesson of the core
greater the effort gratified it's just

24:51.118 --> 24:52.019
slow

24:52.019 --> 24:58.618
is it well yeah you're watching you can
see it's slow but what is the origin z

24:58.618 --> 25:01.978
what are you in such a hurry to do young
man

25:01.979 --> 25:05.159
I don't know something else something
better

25:05.159 --> 25:08.940
maybe some different well and what kind

25:11.660 --> 25:17.660
oh you probably tell me that uh making
this canoe is about understanding and

25:17.660 --> 25:26.090
appreciating the process that uh he
stepped on the ward the process not just

25:26.089 --> 25:28.909
a result process

25:28.910 --> 25:33.050
yeah yeah i would probably say that but
you know

25:36.500 --> 25:44.029
oh it's difficult to connect those words
when you're hacking away at the stuff

25:44.029 --> 25:47.029
old wood and you want to make that
connection

25:48.579 --> 25:51.500
but a good thing

25:51.500 --> 25:56.660
my mind is working at the speed of life
and working at this pace like be tossed

25:56.660 --> 25:57.620
back in time
