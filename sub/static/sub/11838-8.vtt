WEBVTT

00:01.968 --> 00:04.403
>> mac: So what if I didn't go
to college?

00:04.405 --> 00:06.405
John mcclane didn't go to
college.

00:06.407 --> 00:08.507
He defeats the bad guys using
street smarts, and I got street

00:08.509 --> 00:11.643
>> dennis: Mac, you do realize
john mcclane's a fictional

00:11.645 --> 00:15.147
Character who's voicing lines
written by screenwriters who

00:15.149 --> 00:17.149
Almost certainly went to
college.

00:17.151 --> 00:19.151
>> dee: Yeah, but bruce willis
dropped out of college, and that

00:19.153 --> 00:20.152
Supports mac's argument.

00:20.154 --> 00:20.986
>> yeah!

00:20.988 --> 00:24.089
And the fact that you can't
understand that leads me to

00:24.091 --> 00:26.191
Believe that you are complete
and total dum-dum, and therefore

00:26.193 --> 00:29.528
Are not going to get selected
for this intelligence

00:29.530 --> 00:33.098
>> welcome, everybody, and thank
you for volunteering in this

00:33.100 --> 00:35.501
Intelligence experiment.

00:35.503 --> 00:39.438
I'm afraid, however, that we can
only use one test subject.

00:39.440 --> 00:42.541
>> I-I'm sorry, before you
continue, um, I noticed you said

00:42.543 --> 00:45.344
"volunteering," which implies a
lack of compensation.

00:45.346 --> 00:46.678
>> volunteering's for suckers.

00:46.680 --> 00:49.114
>> yes, the selected subject
will receive $1,000 in

00:49.116 --> 00:50.115
Compensation.

00:50.117 --> 00:51.116
>> dee: There you go.

00:51.118 --> 00:52.184
>> that's what we're talking!

00:52.186 --> 00:55.187
Okay, and listen, when it comes
to intelligence, I think

00:55.189 --> 00:59.425
>> or perhaps a man is not what
you're looking for at all.

00:59.427 --> 01:02.394
>> I'm afraid my friend dennis
confuses book learning with

01:02.396 --> 01:03.395
Brainpower.

01:03.397 --> 01:05.397
But you and me, we know
different, huh?

01:05.399 --> 01:06.398
>> uh, "you and I."

01:06.400 --> 01:08.033
>> what? No, not you and I.

01:08.035 --> 01:09.301
Him and I, idiot.

01:09.303 --> 01:11.637
>> in case I was being unclear,
nerds, I will bang one or both

01:11.639 --> 01:15.107
>> dee, this man is smart enough
to know to avoid a proposition

01:15.109 --> 01:16.375
Like that from someone like you.

01:16.377 --> 01:19.044
>> to be clear, we're not
looking for a subject with

01:19.046 --> 01:20.312
Superior intelligence.

01:20.314 --> 01:23.749
In fact, the complete opposite
would be, um, uh, preferable.

01:23.751 --> 01:24.783
Excuse me for a minute.

01:24.785 --> 01:26.085
I'm sorry, wait, wait!

01:26.087 --> 01:27.252
That's a... Sorry.

01:27.254 --> 01:30.456
>> charlie: I was gonna bash
your rat and take care of your

01:30.458 --> 01:34.226
>> oh, no, no, no, no, please,
please, this is, this is our lab

01:34.228 --> 01:35.327
Rat.

01:35.329 --> 01:37.129
His name's armitage shanks.

01:37.131 --> 01:40.299
If he solves the maze, he gets
the cheese.

01:40.301 --> 01:43.168
And since we've been feeding
armitage a cerebral enhancement

01:43.170 --> 01:46.338
Formula, he's been solving these
mazes seven times faster.

01:46.340 --> 01:50.242
We'd like to try a formula out
on a human subject.

01:50.244 --> 01:53.645
What would you think about
something like that?

01:53.647 --> 01:56.648
A pill that could make you seven
times smarter.

01:56.650 --> 01:59.284
(armitage shanks squeaking)

01:59.286 --> 02:02.087
>> cheese, huh?

02:02.089 --> 02:04.256
Yeah, all right.

02:04.258 --> 02:06.258
(buzzer sounds)
ow! Shit!

02:06.260 --> 02:07.793
>> what's your name, young man?

02:07.795 --> 02:10.295
Hold up, dude, I want to get
this cheese here.

02:10.297 --> 02:12.865
(buzzer sounds)
aah! Shit!

02:12.867 --> 02:17.302
>> why don't you try the cheese
under the green light, charlie?

02:17.304 --> 02:19.104
>> I want this cheese.

02:19.106 --> 02:20.272
(buzzer sounds)

02:20.274 --> 02:21.773
Aah!

02:21.775 --> 02:24.610
>> ladies and gentlemen, we have
found our test subject.

02:24.612 --> 02:34.720
Thank you all very much for
coming.

02:34.722 --> 02:52.471
Thank you all very much for
coming.

02:52.473 --> 02:54.873
>> aw, frank, you're intruding
upon my education.

02:54.875 --> 02:56.308
>> this is crazy, charlie.

02:56.310 --> 02:57.342
That's crazy.

02:57.344 --> 02:58.477
>> aw, shut up.

02:58.479 --> 02:59.878
>> whoa, what the hell is this?

02:59.880 --> 03:01.246
What are you doing, man?

03:01.248 --> 03:03.315
>> well, I'm trying to learn
mandarin and listen to beethoven

03:03.317 --> 03:06.652
You see, I just realized that I
have two ears, so it's a waste

03:06.654 --> 03:08.387
To only listen to one thing.

03:08.389 --> 03:09.388
>> let me guess this straight.

03:09.390 --> 03:10.389
You just realized that you have

03:10.391 --> 03:13.392
>> taking a pill is not gonna
make you smarter, charlie.

03:13.394 --> 03:15.260
>> I don't know about that,
frank.

03:15.262 --> 03:17.496
I've listened to five books on
tape already this morning, five.

03:17.498 --> 03:19.565
>> charlie, come on, any idiot
can listen to books on tape.

03:19.567 --> 03:21.567
You're only doing that because
you can't read, all right?

03:21.569 --> 03:23.569
Trust me, if you're feeling any
smarter, it's just a classic

03:23.571 --> 03:24.570
Case...

03:24.572 --> 03:26.438
>> both: ... Of the placebo
effect.

03:26.440 --> 03:28.907
>> I considered that, but I
don't think that's it, dennis.

03:28.909 --> 03:31.510
>> whatever, you don't even know
what the word placebo...

03:31.512 --> 03:33.512
>> placebo means from the latin
"placebo," meaning "I shall

03:33.514 --> 03:36.415
I listened to a chapter on that
this morning.

03:36.417 --> 03:37.416
>> this is...

03:37.418 --> 03:38.417
>> such bullshit?

03:38.419 --> 03:39.685
>> I wasn't gonna say...

03:39.687 --> 03:41.286
>> gonna say that?

03:41.288 --> 03:43.855
>> dude, just because you're
finishing our sentences, doesn't

03:43.857 --> 03:44.957
Make you s-s-s...

03:44.959 --> 03:45.958
>> both: Intelligent.

03:45.960 --> 03:49.795
(charlie laughs)
>> guys, guys, we've got a huge

03:49.797 --> 03:52.798
>> ugh, big rat, like the
biggest ever in the back office.

03:52.800 --> 03:54.866
>> uh, that sounds like charlie
work, so, charlie, why don't you

03:54.868 --> 03:56.868
Hop on that, and be smart about
it.

03:56.870 --> 03:58.403
>> good pleasantry, cute.

03:58.405 --> 03:59.805
How about no?

03:59.807 --> 04:00.872
>> what do you mean "no"?

04:00.874 --> 04:04.243
You know what, that might occupy
you guys for about a week or so,

04:04.245 --> 04:06.545
And that'll give me some time to
continue my education in peace.

04:06.547 --> 04:07.779
That be nice. Let's do that.

04:07.781 --> 04:08.780
>> what are you talking about?

04:08.782 --> 04:12.417
Wh-wh-what kind of a genius rat
are we talking about?

04:12.419 --> 04:14.419
>> you have to be a real moron
to get outsmarted by a rat,

04:14.421 --> 04:18.624
>> well, <i>bonjours,</i> killing the
the rat, my friends.

04:18.626 --> 04:20.959
â™ª
>> oh, and then I realized,

04:25.265 --> 04:27.966
Tang-see, that these so-called
friends of mine have been

04:27.968 --> 04:29.835
Exploiting my labor for years.

04:29.837 --> 04:31.737
>> an astute observation.

04:31.739 --> 04:34.906
Conforms with marxist theories
about the exploitation of the

04:34.908 --> 04:36.742
Proletariat.

04:36.744 --> 04:39.745
>> it completely conforms when
you think about it.

04:39.747 --> 04:43.348
Ah, tang-see, these-these
pills are having quite

04:43.350 --> 04:46.618
And the combination with my
readings is really leading me

04:46.620 --> 04:48.587
Into some rather large ideas.

04:48.589 --> 04:51.323
I think I could be on the verge
of something groundbreaking.

04:51.325 --> 04:52.457
>> yes.

04:52.459 --> 04:54.993
The work you're proposing will
revolutionize the field.

04:54.995 --> 04:56.595
>> exactly, right?

04:56.597 --> 04:58.664
Now, tang-see, let's-let's talk
for a second.

04:58.666 --> 05:00.365
What do you think my iq is now?

05:00.367 --> 05:01.433
And be honest.

05:01.435 --> 05:03.769
>> well, what do you think it
is?

05:03.771 --> 05:05.537
>> 175?

05:05.539 --> 05:06.772
>> wow.

05:06.774 --> 05:10.275
Now, I'm thinking if I were to
double the dosage, I could break

05:10.277 --> 05:12.377
200 easily.

05:12.379 --> 05:14.446
>> you have to be careful,
charlie.

05:14.448 --> 05:16.014
This is uncharted waters here.

05:16.016 --> 05:18.784
Have you been having any side
effects?

05:18.786 --> 05:20.619
>> yes. Okay, yes.

05:20.621 --> 05:23.322
There's-there's been a-a slight
ringing in my ears.

05:23.324 --> 05:25.724
My-my legs grow numb from time
to time.

05:25.726 --> 05:27.726
I ache all over if I'm being
honest, but...

05:27.728 --> 05:29.728
(door opens)
>> I got mongolian barbecue and

05:29.730 --> 05:32.898
<i>Police academy: Mission to</i>
<i>moscow.</i>

05:32.900 --> 05:35.534
>> frank, frank, frank, frank,
I got to stop you.

05:35.536 --> 05:37.569
Uh, tonight is really not the
best night for that, so I'm

05:37.571 --> 05:38.570
Sorry, man.

05:38.572 --> 05:41.807
>> but, charlie, it's gruesome
twosome Tuesday.

05:41.809 --> 05:44.676
>> yeah, uh, I know it is, pal,
but...

05:44.678 --> 05:47.846
>> I'm-I'm on the verge of
something really groundbreaking

05:47.848 --> 05:49.881
Here and I-I really shouldn't be
playing these childish games

05:49.883 --> 05:51.016
Anymore, nor should you.

05:51.018 --> 05:54.019
>> you don't have to keep
saying that, I know...

05:54.021 --> 05:55.887
(frank grunting)
the sound effects won't

05:55.889 --> 05:56.755
Help you.

05:56.757 --> 05:57.756
>> the gruesome twosome.

05:57.758 --> 05:59.658
(frank grunting)
>> they don't further your

05:59.660 --> 06:00.659
Argument in any way.

06:00.661 --> 06:03.829
(frank grunting)
(speaking mandarin)

06:03.831 --> 06:04.996
>> you speak mandarin?

06:04.998 --> 06:07.499
>> well, I do think I'm getting
it a little bit.

06:07.501 --> 06:09.868
(both speaking mandarin)
(both laughing)

06:14.574 --> 06:17.075
(both speaking mandarin)
(rat squeaking)

06:24.517 --> 06:27.452
>> hey, mac, mac, I've located
him-- he's right near the hole.

06:27.454 --> 06:28.687
>> oh, good, let me bash him!

06:28.689 --> 06:30.856
>> no, no, no... (shushes)
oh, goddamn it.

06:30.858 --> 06:33.859
>> all right, well, when he
comes back, I'm gonna smash him

06:33.861 --> 06:34.860
Up good.

06:34.862 --> 06:35.861
>> no, no, mac, come on.

06:35.863 --> 06:37.062
We're smarter than that.

06:37.064 --> 06:39.531
That's just gonna spread rat
blood and disease all over the

06:39.533 --> 06:40.532
Place.

06:40.534 --> 06:41.733
It's not about brute force.

06:41.735 --> 06:44.136
It's about seduction.

06:44.138 --> 06:46.538
See, I'm gonna place some
enticing tunes for the little

06:46.540 --> 06:55.380
And then I'm gonna bait this
glue trap with some brie cheese.

06:55.382 --> 07:00.085
>> â™ª and I want you here
with me

07:00.087 --> 07:05.457
â™ª from tonight until
the end of time

07:05.459 --> 07:10.562
You should know... â™ª
>> hey, you guys catch that rat

07:10.564 --> 07:11.563
Yet?

07:11.565 --> 07:12.798
>> any minute now, dee.

07:12.800 --> 07:15.901
>> I'm telling you, glue traps
are barbaric and messy.

07:15.903 --> 07:19.504
I have come up with the
intelligent solution.

07:19.506 --> 07:20.806
Ultrasonic rodent repellant.

07:20.808 --> 07:23.074
It emits a high-pitched sound
that obliterates their teeny rat

07:23.076 --> 07:24.075
Eardrums.

07:24.077 --> 07:25.076
Stupid rats.

07:25.078 --> 07:27.078
>> uh, those things don't work,
dee.

07:27.080 --> 07:28.113
>> oh, no?

07:28.115 --> 07:30.415
Okay, how about we do a little
wager.

07:30.417 --> 07:33.118
The rat gets trapped to your
glue trap and you win.

07:33.120 --> 07:35.620
The rat scurries away and never
comes back again, then I am

07:35.622 --> 07:37.823
Crowned the smartest in the...

07:37.825 --> 07:39.090
Oh, god, gross.

07:39.092 --> 07:41.126
Is that cheese?

07:41.128 --> 07:42.427
Get it off me!

07:42.429 --> 07:45.030
Get it off, I'm st... I'm stuck
to your glue!

07:45.032 --> 07:48.800
>> you've trapped yourself on a
trap that was designed for a

07:48.802 --> 07:50.802
Rodent with a brain the size of
a walnut.

07:50.804 --> 07:52.804
>> now a normal-size woman would
probably just be able to slide

07:52.806 --> 07:54.806
Her hand right out, but with
those giant man hands...

07:54.808 --> 07:56.675
>> yeah, you really don't stand
a chance, dee.

07:56.677 --> 07:57.676
>> okay, I get it.

07:57.678 --> 07:59.678
(rat squeaking)
do you hear that?

07:59.680 --> 08:01.680
I hear it-- oh, god, it's
coming!

08:01.682 --> 08:02.948
It's coming to eat its cheese.

08:02.950 --> 08:05.951
>> odd that it hasn't been
repelled by your supersonic rat

08:05.953 --> 08:06.952
Scarer, dee.

08:06.954 --> 08:07.953
>> guys! It's on me!

08:07.955 --> 08:10.956
Oh, it's climbing up my hand to
eat the cheese.

08:10.958 --> 08:13.458
>> now, where this gets
interesting is when the rat

08:13.460 --> 08:17.863
>> ooh, yes, maybe it'll nibble
her hand down to a tiny, bloody

08:17.865 --> 08:19.865
Stump, then she could just
slide it right out.

08:19.867 --> 08:20.866
>> hey.

08:20.868 --> 08:22.667
>> ah, goddamn it, it's gone.

08:22.669 --> 08:25.036
It ate its cheese and then it
ran away.

08:25.038 --> 08:28.006
>> huh, maybe this rat is a
little bit smarter than we gave

08:28.008 --> 08:28.807
It credit for, mac.

08:28.809 --> 08:31.109
>> hmm.

08:36.482 --> 08:39.184
>> he is whatever, I mean, is he
okay? Sure.

08:39.186 --> 08:40.185
Is he fine?

08:40.187 --> 08:44.689
All I'm saying is that stephen
hawking is much more of a lady

08:44.691 --> 08:47.893
Gaga than, you know,
johann sebastian bach.

08:47.895 --> 08:49.995
He-he's not, he's a pop culture
figure like the kardashians, you

08:49.997 --> 08:50.996
Know?

08:50.998 --> 08:51.830
>> hmm.

08:51.832 --> 08:53.565
(high-pitched ringing)
>> god.

08:53.567 --> 08:54.566
>> are you all right?

08:54.568 --> 08:56.568
>> yes, that's the shooting
pain in the eye.

08:56.570 --> 08:57.702
Jot that down, please.

08:57.704 --> 09:00.839
(speaking mandarin)
huh?

09:00.841 --> 09:01.840
Yes, I heard-heard the words.

09:01.842 --> 09:02.841
>> I'm learning mandarin.

09:02.843 --> 09:03.842
It means "you got that right."

09:03.844 --> 09:05.844
>> yes, frank, I got what right,
though?

09:05.846 --> 09:06.845
>> the thing about the cripple.

09:06.847 --> 09:07.679
>> what cripple?

09:07.681 --> 09:08.547
Why are you speaking?

09:08.549 --> 09:11.216
>> dear god, we were talking
about that like ten minutes ago.

09:11.218 --> 09:13.218
>> but I didn't know what I was
gonna say.

09:13.220 --> 09:16.221
>> you never know what you're
gonna say, and that's the

09:16.223 --> 09:17.222
Problem, isn't it?

09:17.224 --> 09:19.224
(speaking mandarin)
>> say that again?

09:19.226 --> 09:21.927
(charlie speaking mandarin)
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,

09:21.929 --> 09:23.695
Whoa, whoa, you're going too
fast, I can't...

09:23.697 --> 09:24.529
Go slower.

09:24.531 --> 09:26.531
>> frank, I cannot go slower
for you!

09:26.533 --> 09:27.532
Checkmate, tang-see, wake up.

09:27.534 --> 09:28.533
Open your eyes, listen.

09:28.535 --> 09:31.803
Frank, I am thinking on the
physical level, the metaphysical

09:31.805 --> 09:35.874
Every time you open your mouth,
you drag me down into the mud,

09:35.876 --> 09:38.043
And-and really, my-my...

09:38.045 --> 09:41.212
(high-pitched ringing)
(groaning)

09:41.214 --> 09:42.314
>> what?

09:42.316 --> 09:43.548
You got a pain?

09:43.550 --> 09:44.583
Charlie, I'm telling you.

09:44.585 --> 09:45.584
Those pills are no good for you.

09:45.586 --> 09:47.586
They're hurting you, those
pills.

09:47.588 --> 09:49.921
They're turning you into someone
you're not.

09:49.923 --> 09:52.624
(tang-see speaking mandarin)
shut up!

09:52.626 --> 09:54.092
>> (laughing): Okay, okay.

09:54.094 --> 09:57.996
Don't get cute, tang-see, you're
not much smarter than he is.

09:57.998 --> 10:01.166
Checkmate.

10:01.168 --> 10:05.770
>> well, you know, it-it,
uh... Hmm...

10:05.772 --> 10:07.305
>> try jerking it again.

10:07.307 --> 10:09.574
>> jerked it, I mean, I've
jerked it so many times.

10:09.576 --> 10:11.576
I've jerked and squirmed and
squiggled.

10:11.578 --> 10:12.577
>> this is crazy.

10:12.579 --> 10:14.579
I mean, we should be able to
figure this out.

10:14.581 --> 10:15.580
>> ooh, oh!

10:15.582 --> 10:18.750
Pour a little bit of gasoline on
there, dissolve some of the

10:18.752 --> 10:19.751
Glue.

10:19.753 --> 10:20.986
>> you are a brilliant man, yes!

10:20.988 --> 10:22.087
Try it.

10:22.089 --> 10:23.588
>> yeah, gasoline is a solvent.

10:23.590 --> 10:24.623
That's basic chemistry.

10:24.625 --> 10:26.091
Smart, mac, smart, go grab some.

10:26.093 --> 10:29.094
>> yeah, all right. Oh, we got
to be careful though because

10:29.096 --> 10:31.196
Gasoline is volatile and highly
combustible so let's use extreme

10:31.198 --> 10:34.633
>> of course, only an idiot
would just use gasoline

10:34.635 --> 10:35.634
Willy-nilly.

10:35.636 --> 10:36.635
>> it's gonna work.

10:36.637 --> 10:39.604
>> and in the interest of
safety, I'm gonna go ahead and

10:39.606 --> 10:41.606
Just make sure that this is, in
fact, gasoline because charlie

10:41.608 --> 10:43.274
Likes to keep booze
in here sometimes.

10:43.276 --> 10:44.275
>> that's true, he does do that.

10:44.277 --> 10:45.276
>> mm-hmm.

10:45.278 --> 10:47.278
(sniffs)
>> yeah!

10:47.280 --> 10:48.613
Yeah, yeah, that's definitely...

10:48.615 --> 10:50.281
(whoops)
>> let me double check because,

10:50.283 --> 10:52.283
You know, you're sense of smell
has always been pretty stupid.

10:52.285 --> 10:55.153
>> yeah, yeah, let me just check
it out.

10:55.155 --> 10:57.155
(sniffs)
>> oh, oh, christ, that's good

10:57.157 --> 10:58.189
Stuff... That's high-test.

10:58.191 --> 10:59.190
>> can I get a toot down here?

10:59.192 --> 11:01.192
>> yeah, yeah, go for it,
go for it.

11:01.194 --> 11:03.962
(sniffs)
>> ooh, guys, yes.

11:03.964 --> 11:06.131
>> are you sure it's gasoline
though?

11:06.133 --> 11:07.132
I should just try it again.

11:07.134 --> 11:09.701
(dee whoops)
jesus, jesus!

11:09.703 --> 11:10.969
That's gasoline.

11:10.971 --> 11:12.370
>> all right, let's blast off.

11:12.372 --> 11:13.805
Engage thrusters, captain.

11:13.807 --> 11:15.807
>> oh, all right, well, ground
control, I'll take some.

11:15.809 --> 11:16.808
>> holy shit.

11:16.810 --> 11:17.809
>> as long as we're blasting.

11:17.811 --> 11:20.679
Let's pop off on this shit a
little bit, then let's get back

11:20.681 --> 11:21.346
To business.

11:21.348 --> 11:22.347
>> yeah, okay.

11:22.349 --> 11:23.348
>> this is making me feel...

11:23.350 --> 11:24.649
>> oh, shit, there he goes.

11:24.651 --> 11:26.851
(rat squeaking)
>> oh, he's a squirrely little

11:26.853 --> 11:27.886
Bastard, isn't he?

11:27.888 --> 11:28.920
>> you son of a bitch.

11:28.922 --> 11:31.056
>> he's making I and you look
dumb.

11:31.058 --> 11:32.090
>> yeah... Uh...

11:32.092 --> 11:35.660
"I and you." no, me and you, me,
you, me, I.

11:35.662 --> 11:37.028
It was you and I?

11:37.030 --> 11:38.096
You and I...

11:38.098 --> 11:39.898
>> me and you look dumb.

11:39.900 --> 11:40.899
>> (laughs) dumb.

11:40.901 --> 11:41.900
>> it's got to be...

11:41.902 --> 11:42.901
>> dumb is a funny word.

11:42.903 --> 11:44.903
>> ...Me and... Dumb is a funny
word.

11:44.905 --> 11:45.770
>> dumb.

11:45.772 --> 11:46.438
>> dumb.

11:46.440 --> 11:47.338
>> pass the gas.

11:47.340 --> 11:48.339
>> dumb.

11:48.341 --> 11:49.174
>> pass it, pass it.

11:49.176 --> 11:50.175
>> pass the gas.

11:50.177 --> 11:52.210
(all laughing)
(charlie speaks quietly)

11:56.382 --> 11:59.384
(scoffs)
(laughs)

11:59.386 --> 12:00.852
>> oh, yeah, you're reading now?

12:00.854 --> 12:02.754
Since when do you read?

12:02.756 --> 12:06.925
Uh, well, I was just glancing
at   <i>war and peace</i>and let me

12:06.927 --> 12:11.029
Tell you, I side with
shakespeare on brevity.

12:11.031 --> 12:12.731
"brevity is the soul of wit."

12:12.733 --> 12:14.032
Which, uh...

12:14.034 --> 12:16.034
Do I have to put on training
wheels for this conversation or

12:16.036 --> 12:17.302
Is, uh... What is this?

12:17.304 --> 12:18.303
What are you doing?

12:18.305 --> 12:19.304
>> I'm having dinner with you.

12:19.306 --> 12:21.706
>> I see, you've lifted the
restraining order?

12:21.708 --> 12:25.143
I'm not lifting the restraining
order, but frank paid me $500 to

12:25.145 --> 12:27.378
Be here, and so I'm having
dinner with you.

12:27.380 --> 12:29.380
>> ah, I see.

12:29.382 --> 12:30.949
>> do you? 'cause I don't.

12:30.951 --> 12:34.085
>> well, it's all rather
transparent really, isn't it?

12:34.087 --> 12:37.388
Frank and I have always been
very close as you know, uh, but

12:37.390 --> 12:41.426
I've turned a corner, if you
will, with my life recently.

12:41.428 --> 12:45.063
I have new, more substantial
interests, new friends, better

12:45.065 --> 12:47.499
Suited for those interests, so
understandably frank is feeling

12:47.501 --> 12:50.168
Somewhat marginalized.

12:50.170 --> 12:54.172
Now, he's gone out of his way to
enlist your aid, uh, in hopes

12:54.174 --> 12:57.776
That my deep infatuation with
you will, uh, perhaps pull me

12:57.778 --> 13:00.345
Away from those people and those
pursuits that have, in turn,

13:00.347 --> 13:03.948
Been pulling me away from frank
as of late.

13:03.950 --> 13:05.083
>> what now?

13:05.085 --> 13:07.085
>> frank's using you to get to
me.

13:07.087 --> 13:08.086
How are you? Never mind.

13:08.088 --> 13:09.487
Moving on. Beaujolais?

13:09.489 --> 13:11.523
Why don't you have a little bit,
loosen up.

13:11.525 --> 13:14.993
That'll get rid of that
uninviting edge.

13:14.995 --> 13:17.095
So, uh, tell me about yourself.

13:17.097 --> 13:18.797
Are you quite well these days?

13:18.799 --> 13:22.867
>> well, uh, actually, I'm,
like, okay because my boss,

13:22.869 --> 13:25.870
Like, at the restaurant, he,
like, totally doesn't get me.

13:25.872 --> 13:28.306
I mean, he thinks that being a
waitress is, like, what I am,

13:28.308 --> 13:30.341
And I'm like, "that doesn't
define me, dude, okay?

13:30.343 --> 13:32.877
(high-pitched ringing)
like, I'm saving up to open

13:32.879 --> 13:36.848
(distantly): And I have come up
with all of these great names

13:36.850 --> 13:40.185
Um, some of them are, like, the
hand whisperer or finger

13:40.187 --> 13:42.053
Fantasy.

13:42.055 --> 13:44.522
And I've been watching <i>tabatha</i>
<i>takes over</i> a lot because it's a

13:44.524 --> 13:46.291
Show that takes place in salons.

13:46.293 --> 13:47.392
Finger fantasy.

13:47.394 --> 13:50.795
I've been watching this show
called <i>tabatha takes over...</i>

13:50.797 --> 13:52.831
<i>Tabatha takes over,</i>
<i>tabatha takes over.</i>

13:52.833 --> 13:55.900
And I have been watching <i>tabatha</i>
<i>takes over</i> a lot, because it's

13:55.902 --> 13:57.302
A show that takes place in...

13:57.304 --> 14:05.143
(jaunty music plays)
(cat yowls)

14:05.145 --> 14:05.977
>> yeah, see?

14:05.979 --> 14:07.045
The mouse always wins.

14:07.047 --> 14:09.347
There's... There's, like, no
winning with mices.

14:09.349 --> 14:10.348
>> cat keeps getting hurt.

14:10.350 --> 14:11.216
>> he gets hurt.

14:11.218 --> 14:13.051
>> well, it's dangerous, yeah.

14:13.053 --> 14:15.086
>> what the hell are you guys
doing?

14:15.088 --> 14:17.155
>> we're trying to watch cat and
mouse cartoons to find out how

14:17.157 --> 14:19.324
Kitty cats deal with their rat
issues.

14:19.326 --> 14:22.827
>> if charlie was still around,
none of this would be happening.

14:22.829 --> 14:27.265
He's distracted with that damn
literature and science crap.

14:27.267 --> 14:30.168
(tv switches off)
charlie is our foundation.

14:30.170 --> 14:32.871
Where does a foundation belong?

14:32.873 --> 14:33.538
>> yes.

14:33.540 --> 14:34.405
>> on top.

14:34.407 --> 14:35.273
>> on the bottom.

14:35.275 --> 14:36.174
>> oh.

14:36.176 --> 14:39.010
>> we gotta go grab charlie and
drag him back down into the

14:39.012 --> 14:40.011
Sewer where he belongs.

14:40.013 --> 14:40.945
>> oh...

14:40.947 --> 14:42.180
>> well, well...

14:42.182 --> 14:44.916
>> I can't, see, I've been
outsmarted by a rat and right

14:44.918 --> 14:46.517
Now I'm stuck on its glue trap.

14:46.519 --> 14:48.419
>> did you try the gasoline,
loosening it?

14:48.421 --> 14:51.122
That didn't work, but you know
what does work?

14:51.124 --> 14:52.190
Breathing it in.

14:52.192 --> 14:53.925
(laughs)
>> deandra, are you holding onto

14:53.927 --> 14:54.592
The trap?

14:54.594 --> 14:57.028
>> no.

14:57.030 --> 14:58.529
>> oh, I don't... I don't know.

14:58.531 --> 15:00.398
>> let go of the trap.

15:00.400 --> 15:05.303
(trap clatters to floor)
(laughing)

15:05.305 --> 15:07.939
>> no...

15:07.941 --> 15:09.240
No.

15:09.242 --> 15:10.441
>> that's so stupid.

15:10.443 --> 15:11.309
>> all right, come on.

15:11.311 --> 15:12.210
We gotta go get charlie.

15:12.212 --> 15:13.044
>> uh, no, no.

15:13.046 --> 15:14.112
>> we'll do it. We'll...

15:14.114 --> 15:15.146
>> let's do it tomorrow.

15:15.148 --> 15:16.314
>> we'll nap first.

15:16.316 --> 15:17.615
>> I'm gonna go to sleep.

15:17.617 --> 15:19.284
>> could you turn the tv back
on?

15:19.286 --> 15:21.286
>> tomorrow's good.

15:25.658 --> 15:28.159
â™ª
>> ladies and gentlemen, you're

15:28.161 --> 15:31.963
About to see the results of a
bold experiment in human

15:31.965 --> 15:33.464
Intelligence.

15:33.466 --> 15:34.632
>> he's totally different.

15:34.634 --> 15:36.234
Totally different person.

15:36.236 --> 15:39.070
>> we'll bring our test subject
out now, and I think you'll find

15:39.072 --> 15:42.006
Him a rather incredible
specimen.

15:42.008 --> 15:44.309
Tang-see.

15:44.311 --> 15:46.644
(whirring)
>> (raspy): Ah...

15:53.420 --> 15:56.487
>> (british accent): Thank you,
tang-see, my-my dear,

15:56.489 --> 15:57.288
Dear friend.

15:57.290 --> 16:01.960
(clears throat)
a simple pill...

16:01.962 --> 16:07.632
Ingested by a man who received a
simple idea, a simple thought

16:07.634 --> 16:11.602
So clear and sharp that it cut
through his mind like a soft

16:11.604 --> 16:16.441
Cheese and led him to an
invention.

16:16.443 --> 16:17.608
>> is he doing an accent?

16:17.610 --> 16:23.181
>> every now and then, there are
new modalities, new ways of

16:23.183 --> 16:26.150
Being and understanding our
world.

16:26.152 --> 16:33.157
This invention-- my invention--
will change everything.

16:33.159 --> 16:36.327
For the better, one hopes.

16:36.329 --> 16:41.032
But the good of the scorpion is
not the good of the frog, yes?

16:41.034 --> 16:47.138
(laughing)
(coughing)

16:47.140 --> 16:49.640
You must excuse me.

16:49.642 --> 16:51.409
I've grown quite weary.

16:51.411 --> 16:53.177
>> come on.

16:53.179 --> 16:56.748
>> finally, my friends, at long
last the day has come.

16:56.750 --> 17:02.653
We have the means, the
understanding, the technology...

17:02.655 --> 17:06.724
To allow spiders to talk with
cats!

17:06.726 --> 17:11.496
(audience gasps, exclaims)
(murmuring)

17:11.498 --> 17:15.666
(cat meows)
>> our exploration into the

17:15.668 --> 17:20.204
Effect of environment upon
intelligence was, alas, a

17:20.206 --> 17:22.707
Complete failure.

17:22.709 --> 17:27.512
Self-confidence instilled by a
placebo "intelligence pill" and

17:27.514 --> 17:30.281
Consistently reinforced by my
assistant tang-see did not, in

17:30.283 --> 17:35.019
Fact, make the test subject
smarter.

17:35.021 --> 17:38.423
It did, however, yield
fascinating results.

17:38.425 --> 17:42.794
Uh, the most measurable effect
was a sharp uptick in arrogance.

17:42.796 --> 17:45.797
>> the subject was perfectly
ready to believe he had learned

17:45.799 --> 17:48.366
Mandarin in two days.

17:48.368 --> 17:49.700
>> tang-see!

17:49.702 --> 17:51.669
(speaking mandarin gibberish)
>> again, this is complete

17:56.241 --> 17:58.276
Gibberish.

17:58.278 --> 18:02.113
The subject believed himself to
be a mathematical wizard.

18:02.115 --> 18:05.216
>> ...Plus nine equals box.

18:05.218 --> 18:06.217
All right?

18:06.219 --> 18:07.752
That's where the cat goes.

18:07.754 --> 18:11.389
>> and in the space of an hour,
the subject has lost all

18:11.391 --> 18:15.660
Interest in a woman with whom he
had been in love for years,

18:15.662 --> 18:20.465
Because of her perceived
stupidity relative to himself.

18:20.467 --> 18:24.068
>> perhaps the most interesting
were the series of side effects

18:24.070 --> 18:26.504
That he believed himself to be
having.

18:26.506 --> 18:28.739
Uh, debilitating aches and
pains.

18:28.741 --> 18:31.776
It was all-all in his mind.

18:31.778 --> 18:33.611
>> huh.

18:33.613 --> 18:36.647
Yeah, I guess I do feel kind of
better, so...

18:36.649 --> 18:41.285
I believe I was having the
"plecebe" effect.

18:41.287 --> 18:42.487
>> placebo.

18:42.489 --> 18:43.754
>> pla-ce-bo.

18:43.756 --> 18:46.190
(chuckles)
which is, of course, a...

18:46.192 --> 18:47.425
A funny-sounding word.

18:47.427 --> 18:48.292
>> that is a funny word.

18:48.294 --> 18:49.260
>> it's pretty funny, yeah.

18:49.262 --> 18:50.328
"placebo."

18:50.330 --> 18:51.329
"placebe."

18:51.331 --> 18:53.197
>> placido domingo.

18:53.199 --> 18:55.666
(laughing)
>>   <i>police academy.</i>

18:55.668 --> 18:57.602
(laughs)
which is a good movie, frank.

18:57.604 --> 18:59.537
>> it <i>is</i> a good movie, charlie.

18:59.539 --> 19:01.339
>> you want to go back and watch
it?

19:01.341 --> 19:02.440
>> with all my heart.

19:02.442 --> 19:04.609
>> please, can you not interrupt
the lecture?

19:04.611 --> 19:07.445
>> what is the point of this
stupid, dumb-ass experiment

19:07.447 --> 19:08.446
Anyway?

19:08.448 --> 19:10.715
>> yeah, like, was he smart or
not?

19:10.717 --> 19:11.616
I don't even get it.

19:11.618 --> 19:12.483
>> uh, I don't think so.

19:12.485 --> 19:13.351
Was I smart, sir?

19:13.353 --> 19:16.287
Again, um... If you could let us
finish the lecture, and...

19:16.289 --> 19:18.189
>> you stupid science bitches
couldn't even make my friends

19:18.191 --> 19:19.690
More smarter.

19:19.692 --> 19:21.225
(laughs)
>> hey, you're right!

19:21.227 --> 19:23.227
Stupid science bitch couldn't
even make I more smarter.

19:23.229 --> 19:26.030
All right, let's get out of
here.

19:26.032 --> 19:27.899
>> hey, charlie!

19:27.901 --> 19:30.701
>>   <i>police academ</i>is an awesome
movie.

19:30.703 --> 19:31.536
>> mahoney!

19:31.538 --> 19:32.537
Mahoney's my favorite character.

19:32.539 --> 19:35.540
