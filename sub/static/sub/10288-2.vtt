I cannot believe this article
on tax shelters.

00:05.805 --> 00:08.205
It says the IRS will let you invest
in anything...

to bull semen.

something other than bodily fluids?

00:34.300 --> 00:37.860
Sure. Who's the bimbo in red?

00:38.037 --> 00:41.027
Her name is Sheila.
She's new in the Records Department.

00:41.207 --> 00:44.637
And from what I understand.
she's a pretty tough customer.

00:45.110 --> 00:46.470
Say no more.

00:46.644 --> 00:49.014
She thinks you're a jerk.

00:49.781 --> 00:51.441
We haven't even met.

-Is there some kind of trouble. Mr. Fielding?
-No. Ha-ha-ha.

01:08.096 --> 01:10.286
No. no. no.

01:10.465 --> 01:11.515
I heard you're new...

01:11.700 --> 01:16.470
...and I was wondering if you would like
to get the inside scoop from an old hand.

01:16.972 --> 01:18.462
What is it you really want?

01:19.541 --> 01:24.211
Well. how about. say. dinner at Sardi's.
maybe catch Bobbie Short at the Carlyle?

01:25.080 --> 01:27.810
I think all you're really interested in
is sex.

I am emphatically not some
sort of a beast on the prowl...

01:40.659 --> 01:43.149
...for meaningless, primitive sex.

and held him until the transit police arrived.

-What did he do?

-He talked to us.
-Ah.

these are not a gang of thugs.

about violence on the subways.

that threatens to tear at the very fabric...

13:57.028 --> 13:59.758
I just wanna see if they drugged the food.

14:04.069 --> 14:06.199
Don't you ever watch 60 Minutes?

14:22.454 --> 14:23.484
Mr. Slotkin?

14:25.090 --> 14:27.290
Mr. Slotkin. I just wanna help you.

14:27.459 --> 14:30.949
Is there anyone we can call.
your wife or your parents?

14:31.129 --> 14:32.559
No. I'm not married.

14:32.731 --> 14:35.631
-Parents moved to the old neighborhood.
-The old neighborhood.

14:35.800 --> 14:39.170
Way out on the seventh moon of Saturn.
That's where I grew up.

14:39.337 --> 14:43.967
It was just our family and two others
on this barren. lifeless sphere of ice.

14:44.142 --> 14:45.872
-How about yourself?
-Buffalo.

14:46.043 --> 14:48.813
Oh. my God.

14:48.979 --> 14:52.679
Yeah. but I miss it sometimes.

14:53.249 --> 14:56.379
I know what you mean. I miss the rings.

14:56.552 --> 14:59.322
-The rings?
-Oh. they're beautiful.

14:59.489 --> 15:03.149
Sometimes when the sun hits them
just right...

15:03.326 --> 15:07.256
...the whole sky sparkles
with these vibrant colors.

15:07.430 --> 15:09.090
Sounds wonderful.

15:10.065 --> 15:12.495
Oh. It is.

15:12.668 --> 15:15.398
You know. up on this place Saturn...

15:15.570 --> 15:20.470
...well. there's no war.
there's no poverty. and there's no hunger.

15:20.642 --> 15:22.272
Is that right. Mr. Slotkin?

15:22.444 --> 15:26.044
Absolutely.
We solved those problems eons ago.

15:26.214 --> 15:28.344
Sir. do you realize
that instead of fighting...

15:28.517 --> 15:31.537
...they solve global disputes
with bowling tournaments?

15:33.020 --> 15:36.220
Well. I can't confirm that.

15:37.124 --> 15:39.184
Well. what's so strange about that?

15:39.360 --> 15:42.130
I mean. look at the way
you still do things down here.

15:42.296 --> 15:45.886
I mean. you take any opportunity
to murder each other...

15:46.067 --> 15:49.497
...you tear down your forests.
you poison your streams.

15:50.071 --> 15:54.441
On my planet. everything grows.

15:54.608 --> 15:57.598
We have no violence. no oppression.

15:57.778 --> 16:01.768
No famine. no cruelty. no hatred.

16:01.948 --> 16:04.248
-You've been there.
-No.

16:04.950 --> 16:06.850
But I can imagine it.

16:07.019 --> 16:09.179
Most of us can imagine it.

16:09.354 --> 16:14.124
Some of us want it so bad
that when we can't find it here...

16:14.292 --> 16:16.922
...we imagine it someplace else.

16:17.929 --> 16:19.729
What are you talking about?

16:19.897 --> 16:23.387
You're describing utopia. Mr. Slotkin.

16:23.568 --> 16:25.398
That is an ideal place.

16:25.570 --> 16:28.340
Men have been looking for it
since the beginning of time.

16:28.506 --> 16:31.906
But it doesn't exist here.

16:32.075 --> 16:34.695
Sometimes I wonder
if it exists anywhere.

16:34.878 --> 16:36.238
Oh. it exists. all right.

16:36.412 --> 16:38.382
Believe me. I've been there.

16:38.547 --> 16:41.137
-I'll vouch for him on that.
-Dan.

16:42.016 --> 16:45.106
I love you. Harry.

16:45.286 --> 16:47.216
Thank you. Dan.

16:47.389 --> 16:49.919
-What a fruitcake. huh?
-Mr. Slotkin...

16:50.991 --> 16:52.321
...please. give me the gun.

16:52.493 --> 16:54.693
-No. you stay away from me.
-Mr. Slotkin.

16:55.262 --> 17:00.292
If I had my life to live over again.
I would live it as a blond.

17:01.635 --> 17:05.295
Please. don't make me restrain you.

17:05.472 --> 17:07.801
Oh. that's all you people ever do.

17:07.974 --> 17:12.135
You think of new reasons
for using violence.

17:12.311 --> 17:15.372
You just get people out of the way
if they step out of line.

17:15.549 --> 17:17.848
That's all your species understands.

17:18.384 --> 17:20.414
I mean. God forbid...

17:20.585 --> 17:25.145
...you should actually listen to somebody
if they're different.

17:26.290 --> 17:29.261
I'd like to place a collect call. please.

Where's the gun?

17:47.943 --> 17:50.473
This is the city.

17:51.313 --> 17:53.813
My name is Fielding.

17:54.016 --> 17:57.506
-I'm a cop.
-What happened?

17:57.686 --> 18:00.946
-Everything's under control.
-The lights went out in the building.

18:01.123 --> 18:03.853
Yeah. must've blown a fuse
when he turned the thing on.

18:04.026 --> 18:06.356
It wasn't a fuse.

18:06.528 --> 18:08.828
It was my people.

18:10.497 --> 18:13.127
You see any of them here?

18:13.300 --> 18:15.530
No. they're not here.

18:15.702 --> 18:18.502
But suffice it to say
that they have healed me.

18:18.672 --> 18:21.112
They effected a large-scale
transference of energy...

18:21.274 --> 18:24.214
...which repaired my malfunctioning
Earth adaptation devices.

18:24.377 --> 18:26.437
Mr. Slotkin.
are you sure you feel all right?

18:26.613 --> 18:30.353
Oh. yes. I'm fit as a yefgotrod.

18:31.418 --> 18:33.648
You look it.

18:36.323 --> 18:39.523
Yeah. the guy in the plaid jacket there
is from Saturn.

18:39.693 --> 18:41.963
-That's strange.
-You kidding.

18:42.128 --> 18:46.118
Yeah. they usually come in the spring
when the planet makes its closest approach.

...we invite you to join us on a tour
of one of our native medical institutions.

18:59.144 --> 19:02.054
We feel it will be beneficial
to both our peoples...

19:02.214 --> 19:05.384
...and will help to promote
a mutual trust and harmony...

19:05.551 --> 19:07.421
...between our two worlds.

19:08.787 --> 19:10.807
Thank you.

that you're finally doomed.

Me. I've got a feeling that someday
we're all gonna come together...

19:42.216 --> 19:47.146
...and we're gonna figure out a way
to make this fragile little world of ours...

Oh. I mean--
I mean. it was nice. wasn't it?

Aren't you being just a bit modest?

21:29.484 --> 21:32.394
Well. maybe a bit. Heh.

21:33.588 --> 21:35.148
So how about tonight?

21:36.124 --> 21:40.394
We'll never be able to top last night.
