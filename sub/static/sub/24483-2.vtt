WEBVTT

00:01.573 --> 00:03.641
Previously, on "The Expanse"...

00:06.813 --> 00:08.813
If Mars gets ahold
of whatever's on Venus,

00:08.848 --> 00:10.514
I believe Earth is over.

00:10.550 --> 00:12.449
I want a formal declaration of war.

00:12.485 --> 00:14.785
We're about to be
in the middle of a war zone.

00:14.821 --> 00:16.854
Avasarala's involved in a conspiracy

00:16.889 --> 00:18.355
against this government.

00:18.391 --> 00:20.124
She's left for a covert meeting

00:20.159 --> 00:22.326
on board a ship
owned by Jules-Pierre Mao.

00:22.361 --> 00:23.839
It's not Mei. I don't know who it is.

00:23.863 --> 00:25.529
We're going to do everything we can

00:25.565 --> 00:26.430
to find your daughter.

00:26.465 --> 00:28.566
Wait. This is Mei's medicine.

00:28.601 --> 00:30.501
Strickland's keeping her alive.

00:30.536 --> 00:32.235
When the hybrid burned up in our drive,

00:32.271 --> 00:34.872
something else happened
at that same moment.

00:34.907 --> 00:37.741
A spike... on lo.

00:37.777 --> 00:40.711
There's a decommissioned
helium-3 refinery there,

00:40.746 --> 00:42.513
built by Jules-Pierre Mao.

00:42.548 --> 00:45.649
We've plotted a safe,
clean course for Tycho.

00:45.685 --> 00:47.651
We can go to Tycho... after lo.

00:47.687 --> 00:48.853
Hell with it. I'm in.

00:48.888 --> 00:51.255
- Amos.
- Me too.

00:51.290 --> 00:53.157
Stay with me now.

00:53.192 --> 00:55.192
I need you to help me
take control of the ship.

00:55.228 --> 00:56.527
What was that?

00:56.562 --> 00:57.706
Errinwright is going with missiles

00:57.730 --> 00:59.263
from that escort ship.

00:59.298 --> 01:00.364
17 minutes till impact.

01:00.399 --> 01:02.700
All communications
come through here, yes?

01:02.735 --> 01:04.235
Is this our priority?

01:04.269 --> 01:05.603
If I don't have any evidence,

01:05.638 --> 01:07.838
then my life isn't worth much either.

01:07.874 --> 01:09.206
I got it.

01:09.242 --> 01:11.342
Mao kept his kid's ship
up in the hangar bay.

01:11.377 --> 01:12.843
It's a two-seater.

01:12.879 --> 01:15.346
You'll fly Avasarala out of here.

01:15.381 --> 01:16.660
Powering up.

01:18.000 --> 01:24.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:43.409 --> 01:45.943
Daddy.

01:45.978 --> 01:47.216
Mei...

01:49.749 --> 01:51.615
Don't you want to be able to fly one day?

01:58.591 --> 02:00.090
[screaming

02:03.996 --> 02:07.398
Oh, did you have a bad dream?

02:07.433 --> 02:10.467
I want my daddy.

02:10.502 --> 02:15.239
I know you do, sweetheart.
But you're a big girl.

02:16.609 --> 02:18.909
And big girls don't cry, now, do they?

02:18.945 --> 02:20.577
No.

02:20.613 --> 02:23.247
Now, you told me you could
take care of yourself.

02:23.282 --> 02:24.648
Were you lying?

02:24.684 --> 02:27.284
No.

02:27.320 --> 02:28.786
What is this place?

02:28.821 --> 02:31.488
Oh, well, only very, very special people

02:31.524 --> 02:33.324
get to come here.

02:33.359 --> 02:37.261
I brought you here
because you are special.

02:37.296 --> 02:38.963
Now, this nurse is going to take you

02:38.998 --> 02:41.765
for a little checkup...
it's okay, it's okay.

02:41.801 --> 02:43.500
She's gonna give you your medicine too.

02:43.536 --> 02:45.235
You know how important that is.

02:45.271 --> 02:46.704
I can't ever miss a dose.

02:46.739 --> 02:47.816
That's right.

02:47.852 --> 02:50.474
Then after that, it's dinnertime.

02:50.509 --> 02:52.443
Are you hungry? I'll bet you're hungry.

02:54.647 --> 02:55.879
Bye-bye.

03:29.323 --> 03:31.557
How are you, sir? Good to meet you.

03:31.592 --> 03:34.460
Sir it's... it's a pleasure. How are you?

03:34.495 --> 03:35.961
Good to see you.

03:35.997 --> 03:37.463
Sir, how was your trip?

03:37.498 --> 03:39.498
It's good to see you.

03:39.533 --> 03:42.635
Sir... I haven't seen you in some time.

03:42.670 --> 03:43.670
Good to see you.

03:56.884 --> 03:58.484
Good to see you again, sir.

03:58.519 --> 04:00.486
There's nothing good about it.

04:09.433 --> 04:11.818
_

04:26.499 --> 04:28.499
_

04:31.886 --> 04:34.019
The escort ship is slowing down.

04:34.055 --> 04:35.888
They're scanning the debris.

04:35.923 --> 04:37.552
I don't see the drop ship.

04:39.493 --> 04:41.393
Neither do I.

04:41.429 --> 04:44.330
Can't you make this goddamn
display any clearer?

04:44.365 --> 04:46.965
This is the best I can do
with passive scans.

04:47.001 --> 04:48.634
If I turn on any active sensors,

04:48.669 --> 04:49.868
it'll give us away.

04:49.904 --> 04:51.070
Fine.

04:53.574 --> 04:54.873
I'm sorry about Cotyar.

04:56.477 --> 04:58.115
Did you kill him?

04:58.913 --> 05:01.113
Then forget your "sorry" s.

05:16.530 --> 05:18.093
What is this?

05:18.666 --> 05:21.667
- That's the hammerlock.
- Speak politician.

05:21.702 --> 05:23.569
If we're within that range and they fire,

05:23.604 --> 05:25.804
we won't be able to dodge the torpedoes.

05:25.840 --> 05:28.407
Then perhaps we should move a bit faster.

05:28.442 --> 05:31.910
The second we light up our
drive, they'll see it and fire.

05:31.946 --> 05:33.746
Best we can do is sit tight and wait.

05:33.781 --> 05:36.448
For the love of...

05:50.798 --> 05:53.432
So are we safe now?

05:53.467 --> 05:55.934
Depends on your definition of "safe."

05:55.970 --> 05:59.037
This is not a gun ship.
We have no active defenses.

05:59.073 --> 06:01.106
But she's fast and maneuverable.

06:01.142 --> 06:02.786
At this separation,
a good pilot would be able

06:02.810 --> 06:03.776
to dodge a torpedo.

06:03.811 --> 06:04.910
Are you a good pilot?

06:04.945 --> 06:06.445
No, I'm a marine.

06:06.480 --> 06:09.548
Pilots carry me to kill things.

06:09.583 --> 06:10.943
I'm just gonna take a look around.

06:15.055 --> 06:17.489
There's a lot of ships in the Jupiter AO,

06:17.525 --> 06:18.525
within close proximity

06:18.559 --> 06:21.160
and well outside
the normal patrol routes.

06:23.531 --> 06:26.765
Looks like Errinwright
finally got his war.

06:32.940 --> 06:34.139
Shit.

06:34.175 --> 06:35.507
- They got us.
- Not yet.

06:35.543 --> 06:36.667
Hang on.

07:07.566 --> 07:09.967
- What are you doing?
- Trying not to kill you.

07:19.979 --> 07:21.812
I can't go any slower than this.

07:21.847 --> 07:23.814
Is that better?

07:23.849 --> 07:25.782
I'm all right.

07:25.818 --> 07:28.952
But maybe not if we have to keep this up.

07:36.161 --> 07:39.062
- We need to send a message.
- We can't.

07:39.098 --> 07:40.909
Our comms were locked out
from the "Guamshiyin."

07:40.933 --> 07:44.234
I know, but surely there must
be some kind of radio

07:44.269 --> 07:46.700
on that contraption you're wearing.

07:47.673 --> 07:49.773
I've got an emergency
wideband transmitter

07:49.808 --> 07:53.276
but is low power and only
sends MCRN encrypted.

07:53.312 --> 07:56.113
Only Martians will understand it.

07:56.148 --> 07:57.948
Good.

07:57.983 --> 07:59.249
To them, you're a war criminal

07:59.284 --> 08:01.118
and I'm a deserter.

08:02.688 --> 08:04.655
The UN is trying to kill us.

08:04.690 --> 08:06.957
If Mars throws us both in prison,

08:06.992 --> 08:09.306
that's an improvement.

08:10.029 --> 08:11.962
You have a better idea?

08:11.997 --> 08:14.698
No.

08:14.733 --> 08:16.166
I'm leaving our names out of it.

08:16.201 --> 08:17.801
Good.

08:36.857 --> 08:40.816
_

08:56.675 --> 08:57.841
These green panels can

08:57.876 --> 08:59.054
be installed anywhere on the ship.

08:59.078 --> 09:00.355
All they need is a feed line
from the water filter.

09:00.379 --> 09:03.046
You're gonna fix the table
in the galley, right?

09:03.082 --> 09:04.214
We still have to eat.

09:04.249 --> 09:06.083
These are just test units.

09:06.118 --> 09:08.318
When we do it properly,
all we'll need is areca palm,

09:08.353 --> 09:10.153
lady palm, spider plant, and peace lily.

09:10.189 --> 09:11.121
Those are the best purifiers.

09:11.156 --> 09:12.467
We're running low on air filters.

09:12.491 --> 09:13.457
This should stretch
what we've got till after IO.

09:13.492 --> 09:16.226
Oh, and Amos rigged a safety shutter

09:16.261 --> 09:17.494
to protect the panels

09:17.529 --> 09:19.663
in case the compartment needs
to be evacuated.

09:19.698 --> 09:21.364
Well, that was Doc's idea too.

09:28.307 --> 09:29.673
All right.

09:29.708 --> 09:31.174
Let's hook 'em up.

09:31.210 --> 09:32.970
It's been a while
since I worked on a garden.

09:34.713 --> 09:38.014
UNN and MCRN fleets
engaged around Saturn,

09:38.050 --> 09:40.751
with both sides suffering heavy losses.

09:40.786 --> 09:42.686
Martian ships now appear
to be pulling back

09:42.721 --> 09:44.688
toward the Belt and Ceres Station,

09:44.723 --> 09:46.990
which remains under MC.

09:47.025 --> 09:48.692
You need to look at the engine.

09:48.727 --> 09:49.727
Why? What's the problem?

09:49.762 --> 09:52.229
We're burning too much fuel too fast,

09:52.264 --> 09:53.975
and at this rate, we could
run out of reaction mass

09:53.999 --> 09:55.198
and wind up on the drift.

09:55.234 --> 09:57.434
Yeah, but... Naomi.

09:57.469 --> 09:59.369
We're going to lo.
We're not turning back...

09:59.404 --> 10:01.171
Yeah, I'm not asking you to.

10:01.206 --> 10:03.540
I know we have to burn dirty
to look like a rockhopper,

10:03.575 --> 10:05.142
but I can tweak the burn.

10:05.177 --> 10:08.044
Same drive signature,
but more efficient...

10:08.080 --> 10:10.046
gives us a bit more margin for error.

10:10.082 --> 10:11.381
Hmm.

10:11.416 --> 10:13.750
That's great. Thanks.

10:15.287 --> 10:17.154
What now?

10:17.189 --> 10:19.456
- IFF just picked up a signal.
- "IFF"?

10:19.491 --> 10:21.391
It's "Identify, Friend or Foe."

10:21.426 --> 10:23.160
It's a target recognition system.

10:23.195 --> 10:25.195
It lets you know if someone's
on your team or not.

10:28.000 --> 10:30.167
I have a high-level diplomatic target

10:30.202 --> 10:31.835
in immediate threat.

10:31.870 --> 10:34.404
This is an MMC emergency assist request.

10:45.812 --> 10:48.846
Whoa, whoa. Stand back, stand back.

10:56.465 --> 10:58.365
Hey! Stop!

11:00.336 --> 11:01.468
Stand back!

11:01.504 --> 11:05.039
Okay... Stop it.

11:05.074 --> 11:06.552
- Stop... stop! Stop it.
- Are you all right?

11:06.576 --> 11:09.476
I'm fine. Let me see.

11:11.267 --> 11:13.734
- Are you a doctor?
- Of sorts.

11:13.769 --> 11:15.736
I'm Anna. What's your name?

11:15.771 --> 11:17.938
- Colin.
- Colin, look at me.

11:17.973 --> 11:19.740
- Is this your first protest?
- Uh-huh.

11:19.775 --> 11:21.942
- Uh, you?
- I've had my share.

11:26.982 --> 11:29.750
Hey, it's fractured. But don't worry.

11:29.785 --> 11:31.952
When it heals,
you'll be stronger than before.

11:31.987 --> 11:33.260
You! What's your name?

11:33.295 --> 11:34.766
We're not supposed to give our name...

11:34.790 --> 11:37.758
Hey! Tell her your freakin' name.

11:37.793 --> 11:39.126
- Michael.
- Michael.

11:39.161 --> 11:41.695
This is Colin.
He needs medical attention.

11:41.730 --> 11:42.807
I know you have a first-aid station

11:42.831 --> 11:44.360
- near here, right?
- No, that's only

11:44.395 --> 11:45.731
- for UN Officials...
- I'm going to be

11:45.755 --> 11:47.634
checking in on Colin.

11:47.670 --> 11:49.114
And if he does not get
the care that he deserves,

11:49.138 --> 11:51.104
things will not go well for you.

11:51.140 --> 11:52.973
Bye, Colin. Go!

12:12.761 --> 12:14.187
The fleet... what I need to know

12:14.222 --> 12:15.640
- is the amount of loss...
- Excuse me.

12:15.664 --> 12:16.630
We're in a meeting.

12:16.665 --> 12:18.555
- Sorry, sir, I thought...
- Anna!

12:22.237 --> 12:24.338
What happened?

12:24.373 --> 12:26.206
Your MPs were handing them out

12:26.241 --> 12:27.908
to the protestors.

12:27.943 --> 12:30.043
Well, you haven't changed a bit.

12:31.981 --> 12:33.680
I like to think I have.

12:37.186 --> 12:39.886
Undersecretary Sadavir Errinwright,

12:39.922 --> 12:43.323
this is Reverend Doctor
Anna Volovodov, an old friend.

12:43.359 --> 12:44.958
- Pleasure.
- Hello.

12:45.373 --> 12:47.027
Give us a minute.

12:48.364 --> 12:49.396
Of course.

12:53.902 --> 12:57.170
- How long has it been?
- Feels like a lifetime ago.

12:57.206 --> 12:58.739
That it does.

13:04.309 --> 13:06.853
_

13:09.918 --> 13:12.219
I wasn't sure that you'd come.

13:12.254 --> 13:13.954
You landed a ship filled with Marines

13:13.989 --> 13:15.689
in the courtyard of my church.

13:15.724 --> 13:17.124
I didn't think I had a choice.

13:17.159 --> 13:18.692
I never imagined you going to church,

13:18.727 --> 13:19.893
let alone running one.

13:20.325 --> 13:22.829
I never imagined you
to end up running the planet.

13:25.467 --> 13:27.701
Why am I here?

13:27.736 --> 13:29.836
I was gonna send you a message...

13:29.872 --> 13:32.305
and then I thought it better in person.

13:32.341 --> 13:34.419
It's not easy for me to
get away these days, because...

13:34.443 --> 13:37.310
...there's a war going on. I've noticed.

13:37.346 --> 13:39.446
- Anna, I need your help.
- Bullshit.

13:42.117 --> 13:43.884
You know that there are

13:43.919 --> 13:45.879
not many people that talk to me
like that anymore.

13:47.022 --> 13:48.789
At least not to my face.

13:52.094 --> 13:53.775
I'm sorry.

13:54.463 --> 13:56.730
That was disrespectful.

13:56.765 --> 13:59.405
You're here because
you talk to me like that.

14:00.002 --> 14:01.768
Esteban...

14:01.804 --> 14:04.137
you haven't needed my help
in a long time.

14:04.173 --> 14:06.339
There have never been times like this.

14:06.375 --> 14:09.916
Eros, Venus, and now war.

14:10.779 --> 14:14.212
The people are terrified
and I want to reassure them.

14:15.017 --> 14:17.284
I'll be addressing the General Assembly.

14:17.319 --> 14:19.152
- Mm.
- It'll be the single

14:19.188 --> 14:20.298
most important speech of my life.

14:20.322 --> 14:22.489
I want you to help me write it.

14:22.524 --> 14:25.125
You want me to help you justify this war?

14:25.160 --> 14:26.426
We didn't start it.

14:26.462 --> 14:27.961
But for the good of the system,

14:27.996 --> 14:30.019
we need to win it and end it.

14:30.799 --> 14:32.432
I want the people of this planet

14:32.468 --> 14:34.101
to feel that God is on our side.

14:34.136 --> 14:37.337
Abraham Lincoln hoped
that he was on God's side.

14:37.372 --> 14:38.778
You see?

14:39.308 --> 14:41.364
You always make me better.

14:42.244 --> 14:43.825
Will you help me?

14:44.980 --> 14:46.446
I'd prefer not to.

15:07.503 --> 15:10.337
My church just opened a free clinic

15:10.372 --> 15:12.478
for undocumenteds.

15:13.342 --> 15:16.376
We have to barter... with drug dealers

15:16.411 --> 15:18.879
for meds that we can't afford.

15:23.886 --> 15:28.989
Support my clinic for... a year...

15:29.024 --> 15:31.039
I'll help you with your speech.

15:31.860 --> 15:35.095
I think we can find money
in some appropriations bill

15:35.130 --> 15:36.794
for a worthy cause such as that.

15:38.901 --> 15:41.268
There's a room for you in the residence.

15:41.303 --> 15:43.436
Get settled. We'll have dinner tonight,

15:43.472 --> 15:45.238
and I'll give you
some preliminary thoughts.

15:53.248 --> 15:55.215
Guys! We got a situation.

15:55.250 --> 15:56.749
- Story of our lives.
- The "Roci" picked up

15:56.773 --> 15:58.518
a distress call. There's a Martian Marine

15:58.554 --> 16:00.187
out there that's in the shit.

16:00.222 --> 16:03.190
This is an MMC emergency assist request.

16:03.225 --> 16:05.025
I have a high-level diplomatic target

16:05.060 --> 16:06.459
in immediate threat.

16:06.495 --> 16:08.128
We are in a civilian racing vessel

16:08.163 --> 16:10.530
being pursued by a rogue UNN hostile.

16:10.566 --> 16:13.164
Request all possible assist.

16:13.969 --> 16:16.709
There are people dying
all over the system, Alex.

16:17.406 --> 16:19.873
So that's it? What, we do nothing?

16:19.908 --> 16:21.333
- Exactly.
- We just got out

16:21.369 --> 16:23.577
of the heroic intervention business.

16:23.612 --> 16:25.879
Okay, let me see if I get this straight.

16:25.914 --> 16:27.948
You wanna log a distress call
against orders

16:27.983 --> 16:29.316
on the "Cant," and you do that.

16:29.351 --> 16:31.051
Naomi decides to ignore

16:31.086 --> 16:33.086
what we all vote on, and she does that.

16:33.121 --> 16:34.554
But a Martian sends up a flare

16:34.590 --> 16:36.056
and all of a sudden, we got rules?

16:36.091 --> 16:37.457
- Alex...
- No!

16:37.492 --> 16:39.092
I swore an oath when I signed up,

16:39.127 --> 16:40.505
and just 'cause I'm not
in uniform anymore

16:40.529 --> 16:42.295
doesn't change that.

16:42.331 --> 16:43.575
A Martian is calling for help.
I'm supposed to help.

16:43.599 --> 16:45.098
Alex, listen up.

16:45.133 --> 16:46.933
I got a fix on the signal.

16:46.969 --> 16:48.969
You're not going to bloody believe this.

16:49.004 --> 16:52.239
The ship's registered to Julie Mao.

16:52.274 --> 16:54.074
- Jesus Christ.
- All right, lay in a course.

16:54.109 --> 16:56.943
- I'm on my way.
- Belay that.

16:56.979 --> 16:58.912
- We're not responding.
- What?

16:58.947 --> 17:00.592
- It's Julie Mao's ship.
- It doesn't change anything.

17:00.616 --> 17:02.082
Captain's right.

17:02.117 --> 17:03.350
It changes everything.

17:03.385 --> 17:06.008
Not what we need to do.

17:07.122 --> 17:10.123
We promised you we'd help
try to find your daughter.

17:12.361 --> 17:13.503
I don't really have a say in this.

17:13.528 --> 17:14.627
Yes, you do.

17:14.663 --> 17:16.096
You're part of this crew.

17:16.131 --> 17:17.208
So we just go back to business?

17:17.232 --> 17:18.376
Can you look him in the eye
and tell him that

17:18.400 --> 17:20.333
whatever this might be is more important

17:20.368 --> 17:22.368
than finding his kid?

17:25.140 --> 17:27.007
I did that once.

17:27.041 --> 17:29.442
I'm not doing it again.

17:42.342 --> 17:45.611
Once again, I find myself
cleaning up your mess, Jules.

17:45.647 --> 17:46.512
It might be beneath your notice,

17:46.548 --> 17:48.181
but I'm fighting a war here,

17:48.216 --> 17:49.360
and I've reached the end of my patience.

17:49.384 --> 17:50.553
You promised me a weapons system

17:50.577 --> 17:52.051
and I want it now.

17:54.122 --> 17:57.557
My accounts are still frozen
and family still in custody.

17:57.592 --> 18:00.092
When those issues have been corrected,

18:00.128 --> 18:03.029
then we can discuss delivery.

18:03.582 --> 18:05.449
Not one minute before.

18:06.685 --> 18:07.718
Piece of shit.

18:14.259 --> 18:16.660
Earth and Mars witness
a power that can turn

18:16.695 --> 18:19.396
an asteroid into a guided missile...

18:19.431 --> 18:22.165
deconstruct a ship down to
its rivets in an instant.

18:22.201 --> 18:24.501
And all they wanna do
is destroy each other over it.

18:24.536 --> 18:25.727
The protomolecule is clearly

18:25.762 --> 18:27.170
not what we thought it was, but...

18:27.206 --> 18:30.843
If Errinwright uses the Hybrids...

18:31.510 --> 18:34.144
they could lay waste to all of Mars.

18:34.179 --> 18:35.645
Oh, that's an extreme scenario.

18:59.304 --> 19:01.271
Hybrid number A-26 has been loaded.

19:01.306 --> 19:03.217
All hybrid pods are ready for transfer.

19:18.690 --> 19:20.791
How you feeling back there?

19:20.826 --> 19:21.858
Like you were standing

19:21.894 --> 19:23.426
on my chest.

19:23.462 --> 19:25.662
I'm fine.

19:25.697 --> 19:27.631
Tunnel vision?

19:27.666 --> 19:31.101
Yes, I feel like I'm in a goddamn tunnel.

19:31.136 --> 19:34.571
- Look around you.
- Sharp headache?

19:34.606 --> 19:36.206
Why?

19:36.241 --> 19:38.341
I'm trying to gauge
if you're having a stroke.

19:38.377 --> 19:40.621
What could you do if I were?

19:41.513 --> 19:42.746
Keep clenching your thighs.

19:42.781 --> 19:44.581
Oh, for the...

19:44.616 --> 19:48.151
If you're hitting on me, I'm flattered.

19:48.187 --> 19:51.822
But I have neither
the inclination, nor...

19:54.459 --> 19:56.159
What does clenching do?

19:56.195 --> 19:57.272
It keeps your blood moving around,

19:57.296 --> 20:00.330
rather than pooling up
in the back of your legs.

20:00.365 --> 20:01.865
Do you like to whistle?

20:01.900 --> 20:04.734
Don't try to distract me...

20:04.770 --> 20:07.270
- like I were a child.
- It forces you to breathe.

20:07.306 --> 20:09.339
Do anything. Just don't pass out.

20:09.374 --> 20:11.208
Relaxing is what gets you.

20:11.243 --> 20:15.846
Given our situation,
it's easy to stay tense.

20:15.881 --> 20:17.914
You seem to be taking this well.

20:17.950 --> 20:19.616
I'm trained for this.

20:19.651 --> 20:21.852
I could do another four Gs
standing on my head.

20:21.887 --> 20:24.788
If I die...

20:24.823 --> 20:27.457
- We're in this together.
- If I die...

20:27.492 --> 20:29.670
make sure you don't.

20:30.262 --> 20:33.296
You have to tell... someone...

20:33.332 --> 20:34.931
what really happened out here.

20:34.967 --> 20:37.634
That's your job. I'm not letting you die.

20:39.771 --> 20:41.371
That wasn't meant to be funny.

20:41.406 --> 20:43.273
I know.

20:43.308 --> 20:46.877
What is... is the thought
of a Martian Marine...

20:46.912 --> 20:49.713
risking her life... for me.

20:51.984 --> 20:53.583
We're on the same side.

20:53.619 --> 20:55.652
Which side is that?

20:55.687 --> 20:57.220
The right side.

21:03.442 --> 21:04.561
Ma'am?

21:06.899 --> 21:09.432
Chrisjen?

21:29.821 --> 21:31.288
Shit.

21:31.323 --> 21:33.223
Brace yourself.

21:40.365 --> 21:41.698
Shit!

21:41.733 --> 21:44.234
Oh, shit!

21:44.269 --> 21:45.769
- What now?
- More torpedoes.

21:45.804 --> 21:49.439
A lot more.
Another ship just fired on us.

21:49.474 --> 21:50.607
Hang on!

22:16.282 --> 22:18.249
I'm sorry.

22:18.284 --> 22:19.584
Don't be.

22:54.320 --> 22:56.120
What happened?

22:56.156 --> 22:57.388
I'm not sure.

23:01.327 --> 23:03.094
What the hell...?

23:05.331 --> 23:07.298
That's not how those things

23:07.333 --> 23:09.167
usually work.

23:16.009 --> 23:19.343
Detonation confirmed,
two of ours for two of theirs,

23:19.379 --> 23:20.511
Copy that.

23:20.547 --> 23:22.191
Our other six are protecting
the Razorback.

23:22.215 --> 23:23.681
That was the easy part.

23:23.717 --> 23:25.679
Alex, I'm coming up.

23:28.221 --> 23:30.021
Helluva plan, Captain.

23:30.056 --> 23:32.001
You must've aced Tactical
Warfare at the Navy OCS.

23:32.025 --> 23:34.258
I didn't like it then any
more than I like it now.

23:34.294 --> 23:36.994
Amos, Prax, get your lids on
and strap in.

23:37.030 --> 23:38.963
Depressurizing in five minutes.

23:38.998 --> 23:42.600
It's a little late for cold feet, doc.

23:42.635 --> 23:44.561
The only reason we're in this scrap

23:44.562 --> 23:45.968
is 'cause you broke the tie.

23:46.039 --> 23:48.339
Those people cried out for help

23:48.374 --> 23:50.174
I couldn't ignore that.

23:50.210 --> 23:52.176
You can't save everyone.

23:52.212 --> 23:54.245
It's a waste of time to try.

23:54.280 --> 23:57.014
And why would you risk
not finding your little girl

23:57.050 --> 24:00.184
for some Martian jarhead
you don't even know?

24:00.220 --> 24:02.508
You've all risked so much to help me.

24:07.227 --> 24:08.693
I can't do any less.

24:16.814 --> 24:18.369
A full year's support?

24:18.404 --> 24:22.240
That's amazing. Everyone at
the clinic will be thrilled.

24:22.275 --> 24:24.709
It means being away from you
for a few weeks.

24:24.744 --> 24:26.544
Surrounded by armed guards.

24:26.579 --> 24:28.746
And... and being a mouthpiece

24:28.782 --> 24:30.715
for a wartime government.

24:30.750 --> 24:33.484
Wait, I'm going to put you down.

24:33.520 --> 24:35.553
What are we talking around?

24:35.588 --> 24:38.623
- I don't know.
- You always do this

24:38.658 --> 24:41.225
when you don't want to look
at something head on

24:41.261 --> 24:43.628
What aren't you looking at?

24:43.663 --> 24:46.130
Esteban. He...

24:46.166 --> 24:48.132
he doesn't bring out the best in me.

24:48.168 --> 24:50.909
I haven't seen him for years,

24:50.944 --> 24:53.771
and I'm still so angry.

24:53.807 --> 24:56.474
I talk about forgiveness
all the time. I...

24:56.509 --> 24:58.576
I can't bring myself to forgive him.

24:58.611 --> 25:00.511
You're not there to forgive him.

25:01.025 --> 25:02.691
You're there to help people
with your words.

25:02.715 --> 25:04.415
And maybe those words will change

25:04.450 --> 25:06.417
the Secretary General's heart, too.

25:06.452 --> 25:07.752
And maybe your own.

25:07.787 --> 25:09.287
Maybe you should do it.

25:09.322 --> 25:11.522
Words are not my gift.

25:11.558 --> 25:16.761
That's obviously untrue.
But you're right, like always.

25:16.796 --> 25:18.663
I'm going to miss you.

25:18.698 --> 25:20.336
We'll miss you, too.

25:20.733 --> 25:25.215
So. Are we going to talk about
that cut on your forehead?

25:26.759 --> 25:28.139
No.

25:29.209 --> 25:32.343
Okay. Then say goodnight to our daughter.

25:32.378 --> 25:34.278
Yeah! Nami!

25:34.314 --> 25:36.614
- Wave to mommy.
- Nami, it's mommy!

25:36.649 --> 25:38.449
This is you.

25:38.484 --> 25:40.451
This is both of you.

25:40.486 --> 25:42.720
And I l-l-l-love, mwah!

25:42.755 --> 25:44.689
See Mommy?

25:44.724 --> 25:47.358
I love you, baby.
Goodnight, sweet dreams.

25:47.393 --> 25:50.928
Bye, Mommy.

26:19.259 --> 26:20.758
The UNN ship just fired on us.

26:20.793 --> 26:22.226
We got their attention.

26:30.436 --> 26:32.139
Amos, Prax, buckle up.

26:32.164 --> 26:33.230
We're good.

26:50.957 --> 26:52.924
Naomi, are all those torpedoes prepped?

26:52.959 --> 26:54.725
They're prepped.

26:55.180 --> 26:56.572
Damn it, if we start trading
punches with this beast,

26:56.596 --> 26:58.207
we're gonna run out of missiles
long before they do.

26:58.231 --> 26:59.196
You know that, right?

26:59.232 --> 27:00.978
That's why we're gonna have to do this.

27:03.403 --> 27:05.077
Damn, are you sure?

27:05.112 --> 27:06.270
We picked this fight,

27:06.306 --> 27:07.383
and we're punching above our weight.

27:07.407 --> 27:08.806
If you've got a better plan,

27:08.841 --> 27:10.737
now would be the time.

27:12.578 --> 27:14.533
All right.

27:15.281 --> 27:16.614
Let's do it.

27:24.834 --> 27:26.834
How bad is it? Worst case scenario.

27:26.870 --> 27:28.980
Fifth fleet is still in
a hard burn towards Jupiter.

27:28.981 --> 27:31.114
Ten ships have been destroyed,
two have been scuttled,

27:31.150 --> 27:34.084
and seven are still engaged
with the Martian fleet, sir.

27:34.119 --> 27:36.153
How are we handling the press on this?

27:36.188 --> 27:38.133
We're currently drafting
a document to be released

27:38.157 --> 27:39.756
to all major news organition

27:39.792 --> 27:41.658
We'll be ready first thing
in the morning.

27:41.694 --> 27:43.927
Then we'll need to see a copy of that.

27:43.963 --> 27:45.963
Yes, sir.

27:45.998 --> 27:47.504
Well, you keep...

27:47.539 --> 27:49.132
...apprised of any changes.

27:53.572 --> 27:55.148
Sorry for interrupting your dinner.

27:55.184 --> 27:58.942
I am not the most important
thing in this room.

27:58.978 --> 28:01.979
I hear you're joining
the S-G's speechwriting team.

28:02.014 --> 28:03.947
Word gets around fast in this building.

28:05.985 --> 28:08.118
And every assault we face,

28:08.153 --> 28:10.687
every injustice we incur,

28:10.723 --> 28:13.657
every man and woman that
we lose on our path,

28:13.692 --> 28:16.960
we will carry in our hearts to a place

28:16.996 --> 28:19.496
where we will stand proud

28:19.532 --> 28:23.000
and say we were not stopped.

28:28.908 --> 28:30.974
Is that you standing behind him?

28:31.010 --> 28:33.076
It was.

28:33.112 --> 28:34.912
- It's quite a speech.
- Mm-hmm.

28:34.947 --> 28:37.014
Practically made the S-G's career.

28:37.049 --> 28:38.649
They teach it in the Diplomatic Corps.

28:38.684 --> 28:39.850
You write it?

28:41.220 --> 28:43.053
I share the blame.

28:43.088 --> 28:45.656
We lost so many ships
around Saturn. At this rate...

28:45.691 --> 28:48.158
They're already pulling their
forces back towards Jupiter.

28:48.193 --> 28:49.860
It's just a matter of time.

28:51.630 --> 28:53.664
Our apologies, Doctor Volovodov.

28:53.699 --> 28:55.499
Anna is just fine.

28:55.534 --> 28:57.012
Pastor Anna, if you attend my church.

28:57.036 --> 28:58.502
Well, there's no chance of that

28:58.537 --> 28:59.870
with this bunch of heathens.

29:01.240 --> 29:02.940
So, Anna.

29:02.975 --> 29:05.676
What do you think of the Arborghast?

29:05.711 --> 29:07.544
Is that a sign from God?

29:08.881 --> 29:10.881
That's a question people
who aren't religious use

29:10.916 --> 29:12.516
to make fun of people who are.

29:12.551 --> 29:15.185
No mockery intended.

29:17.222 --> 29:20.190
I think it's a sign that there are things

29:20.225 --> 29:22.726
in the universe much bigger than we are.

29:24.730 --> 29:27.249
Which is good to be reminded of
now and then,

29:27.933 --> 29:29.967
Jules-Pierre Mao knows what it is.

29:30.002 --> 29:31.041
When we get our hands on that prick,

29:31.065 --> 29:32.235
we'll be sure to ask him.

29:32.271 --> 29:33.570
The bounty's up to 20 million.

29:33.606 --> 29:36.807
- Someone will spot him.
- My money's on a Belter.

29:36.842 --> 29:38.241
They love money.

29:38.277 --> 29:41.096
That would make you a Belter.

29:41.580 --> 29:44.915
If Jules-Pierre Mao is as
smart as his media claim he is,

29:44.950 --> 29:46.950
he'd turn himself in.

29:46.986 --> 29:49.219
We've already frozen his assets.

29:49.254 --> 29:51.154
He can't hide forever.

29:51.190 --> 29:53.757
And if that's not enough, we
know where his children live.

29:55.661 --> 29:59.114
Visiting the sins of
the father on his children?

30:00.332 --> 30:02.766
You know we've had a whole
other Testament since then,

30:02.801 --> 30:04.067
right?

30:04.103 --> 30:05.736
Sometimes...

30:05.771 --> 30:08.739
you need to exert pressure
where it's most effective,

30:08.774 --> 30:10.834
especially in times of war.

30:11.710 --> 30:14.778
Collective punishment
is still a war crime.

30:14.813 --> 30:16.213
Look it up.

30:21.286 --> 30:22.953
Well.

30:22.988 --> 30:26.123
It's important to be reminded of that.

30:26.158 --> 30:28.101
Every now and then.

30:29.194 --> 30:31.061
She's always like this.

30:31.096 --> 30:33.830
Don't worry, you'll get used to it.

30:51.383 --> 30:53.750
They're still shooting at us.

30:53.786 --> 30:56.720
Nice to know they still care.

30:56.755 --> 30:58.021
How're you doing?

30:58.057 --> 31:00.157
I'm fine.

31:00.192 --> 31:02.325
I think I'm getting used to high-g.

31:02.361 --> 31:05.562
I dropped our burn to 1-g
when our escort showed up.

31:05.597 --> 31:07.864
Shit.

31:14.873 --> 31:16.339
It's getting thick out there.

31:24.349 --> 31:26.049
Hey! Doc!

31:26.085 --> 31:27.818
Look at me.

31:27.853 --> 31:29.319
Control your breathing.

31:29.354 --> 31:31.114
In through your nose,
out through your mouth.

31:38.297 --> 31:40.897
Goddamnit, Doc, I told you
to secure that locker!

31:40.933 --> 31:42.232
I'm sorry, I'll... I'll get it.

31:42.267 --> 31:43.547
- Stay in your damn seat!
- Okay!

31:57.883 --> 32:00.016
- Firing PDCs!
- Copy that.

32:24.543 --> 32:28.078
I... I can't breathe!

32:28.113 --> 32:29.980
Hey, your oxygen's knocked out.

32:30.015 --> 32:33.884
Reach behind your head and see
if you can plug it back it.

32:33.919 --> 32:35.285
I can't!

32:40.550 --> 32:43.319
The first generation hybrids
had their limitations,

32:43.354 --> 32:46.355
but we've learned so much since then.

32:46.391 --> 32:48.524
We should dismantle them.

32:48.559 --> 32:50.693
Sir, let's take a breath.

32:50.728 --> 32:52.294
There's no need to dismantle...

32:52.330 --> 32:54.997
Protomolecule can't be controlled.

32:55.032 --> 32:58.401
Actually, sir, that's not true.

32:58.436 --> 33:00.295
It can be controlled.

33:01.038 --> 33:02.605
How?

33:04.909 --> 33:07.243
By using them.

33:07.278 --> 33:10.112
These children are the key.

33:14.952 --> 33:17.653
Now, this might pinch a little.

33:17.688 --> 33:19.655
I've done this before.

33:19.690 --> 33:21.817
Not quite like this.

33:22.693 --> 33:24.093
Ow.

33:26.531 --> 33:27.531
Katoa?

33:27.565 --> 33:28.864
Mei!

33:28.900 --> 33:30.866
I'm so glad you're here!

33:30.902 --> 33:32.334
What's going on?

33:32.370 --> 33:33.580
Hey, now. We are not done with you.

33:33.604 --> 33:35.738
They won't let me see my daddy.

33:35.773 --> 33:38.040
The reason we had to put
a failsafe in the Hybrids

33:38.075 --> 33:39.275
was because sooner or later,

33:39.310 --> 33:41.010
the Protomolecule always broke down

33:41.045 --> 33:43.345
our command and control tech.

33:43.381 --> 33:44.914
But these children...

33:44.949 --> 33:47.416
all these children...

33:47.452 --> 33:50.886
share a rare genetic immune deficiency

33:50.922 --> 33:52.688
that only occurs on Ganymede,

33:52.723 --> 33:55.524
which I discovered could be used

33:55.560 --> 33:58.661
to inhibit the Protomolecule.

34:03.100 --> 34:04.700
Incredible.

34:04.735 --> 34:05.746
They told me that because
of all the fighting,

34:05.770 --> 34:07.520
they'd have to get kids like us out.

34:07.556 --> 34:09.456
Dr. Strickland's here.
He's taking care of us.

34:09.491 --> 34:11.639
I know, but where's my daddy?

34:11.676 --> 34:13.577
They'll take us back when it's safe.

34:14.679 --> 34:17.079
Here's the good part.

34:17.114 --> 34:20.549
Dr. Strickland said that by
the time we're ready to leave,

34:20.585 --> 34:22.051
- we'll be cured.
- Really?

34:22.085 --> 34:23.819
Mm-hmm. He's been
giving us new treatment.

34:23.855 --> 34:25.387
Do you feel better?

34:25.422 --> 34:28.023
- Want to see something cool?
- Yeah.

34:28.059 --> 34:31.427
I believe that if we can fully understand

34:31.462 --> 34:34.129
this process at a molecular level,

34:34.165 --> 34:35.797
it could hold the key

34:35.833 --> 34:38.501
to creating countermeasures
to the Protomolecule...

34:38.536 --> 34:41.203
maybe even find a way to stop
whatever's happening on Venus.

34:49.013 --> 34:50.779
Pretty cool, huh?

34:56.621 --> 34:58.413
Do what you have to do.

35:06.564 --> 35:08.130
Hang in there, I'm coming to get you.

35:41.065 --> 35:43.499
Hang in there! I'm coming!

35:58.749 --> 36:01.684
Doc, look at me! Hang on!

36:24.809 --> 36:26.041
Hang on to that.

36:32.149 --> 36:34.850
Guys, the UNN ship is getting too close!

36:34.885 --> 36:36.118
Now?

36:36.153 --> 36:38.520
- Now!
- Missiles away!

36:49.100 --> 36:51.767
Stand by. Looks like we're
in for another rough ride.

37:26.604 --> 37:28.737
It sheared the engines clean off!

37:28.773 --> 37:30.973
Rest of the ship's intact.

37:31.008 --> 37:33.308
Holy shit, it worked.

37:33.344 --> 37:36.145
All right, setting a course
for the Razorback.

37:36.180 --> 37:37.212
We did it.

37:37.248 --> 37:38.681
Yeah, we sure did.

37:38.716 --> 37:40.249
We only have two torpedoes left.

37:40.284 --> 37:43.118
PDC rounds are under 10%.

37:43.154 --> 37:45.154
We're in a war with no bullets.

37:45.189 --> 37:47.656
- We're not the ones at war.
- We are now.

37:47.692 --> 37:49.625
You think the UN's gonna
give us a free pass

37:49.660 --> 37:51.927
for sparing lives?

37:51.962 --> 37:54.196
We crippled one of their ships.

37:54.231 --> 37:56.398
We just declared war on Earth.

38:20.257 --> 38:22.624
Are you trying to get
yourself killed, Doc?

38:22.660 --> 38:24.077
No.

38:24.695 --> 38:26.228
Because that stuff you said before

38:26.263 --> 38:29.098
about having to save that ship,
that was bullshit.

38:31.936 --> 38:34.136
I keep having this dream
about the child we found

38:34.171 --> 38:36.005
in the incinerator.

38:36.841 --> 38:38.941
That when I find Mei, it'll be too late.

38:41.846 --> 38:43.846
Then why stop to do this?

38:48.619 --> 38:49.837
Because I can't bear the thought

38:49.861 --> 38:51.479
of finding Mei like that.

38:52.356 --> 38:54.356
I don't know shit about parenting.

38:54.391 --> 38:56.058
But what I do know

38:56.093 --> 38:57.659
is that a kid needs at least one person

38:57.695 --> 39:00.329
who never gives up on them,

39:00.364 --> 39:01.997
no matter what.

39:04.702 --> 39:06.286
You had someone like that?

39:06.971 --> 39:09.004
It's not about me.

39:09.039 --> 39:10.832
It's about you.

39:11.208 --> 39:13.375
If you give up on Mei,
what has she got left?

39:15.913 --> 39:17.881
What do you got left?

39:53.984 --> 39:55.284
Chrisjen?

40:06.363 --> 40:08.197
Chrisjen!

40:37.061 --> 40:38.927
Help her, please.
