WEBVTT

00:03.200 --> 00:04.233
[humming]

00:04.300 --> 00:06.600
Max, before you get comfy

00:06.666 --> 00:09.600
Khadijah and Synclaire aren't
here and we're out of pork rinds

00:09.666 --> 00:11.100
so go home.

00:14.333 --> 00:19.300
Did it ever occur to you that
maybe I came over to see you?

00:19.366 --> 00:22.266
[laughing]

00:22.333 --> 00:23.966
Ooh, yeah.

00:24.033 --> 00:26.466
What, k‐k‐k‐k‐k‐k‐kuh, yes!

00:26.533 --> 00:28.500
Oh, my gosh.

00:28.566 --> 00:32.165
That dress has my name
written all over it. Yes!

00:32.232 --> 00:35.900
Uh! Followed by the words
"Stay the hell away."

00:35.966 --> 00:37.166
Uh, Max, Max.

00:37.233 --> 00:40.266
This dress is being used in
a pivotal scene on the soap.

00:40.333 --> 00:42.900
Now, it involves Shelly
the one‐eyed architect

00:42.966 --> 00:44.133
with gingivitis.

00:44.200 --> 00:45.466
‐ So, just‐‐
‐ No, no, no, no, no, no.

00:45.533 --> 00:48.566
Freak Shelly. This dress
is a perfect size six.

00:48.633 --> 00:51.000
And I need a dress
for that‐that reception

00:51.066 --> 00:53.100
at the mayor's mansion
this Saturday. Oh, come on.

00:53.166 --> 00:56.166
You will need some rehab
and a neck brace

00:56.233 --> 00:58.666
if you continue to touch this.

01:00.166 --> 01:02.206
Come on, this is important.

01:02.273 --> 01:06.306
I'll be rubbing elbows
with the mayor, the DA, JFK Jr.

01:06.373 --> 01:08.439
There's even talk that
RuPaul will be there.

01:10.073 --> 01:11.940
I mean, you don't want me
to be out‐dressed

01:12.006 --> 01:13.606
by a drag queen, do you?

01:17.506 --> 01:20.340
Max, that's not
a fair comparison.

01:20.406 --> 01:22.340
RuPaul is more feminine.

I won the McColgan's
shaving cream contest.

02:03.180 --> 02:04.113
‐ Get outta here!
‐ Yup.

02:04.180 --> 02:05.513
Oh, Obie.

02:05.580 --> 02:07.613
A lifetime supply
of shaving cream?

02:07.680 --> 02:09.446
Our prayers have been answered.

02:11.346 --> 02:13.813
No, baby. I won the grand prize.

02:13.880 --> 02:15.546
I get to take a shot
from the three‐point line

02:15.613 --> 02:16.813
at the Knicks' game on Saturday.

02:16.879 --> 02:18.279
‐ Alright!
‐ Yeah.

02:18.346 --> 02:19.613
Whoop‐de‐doo.

02:21.680 --> 02:25.313
And if I hit it, I win $10,000.

02:25.380 --> 02:27.513
Did I mention whoop‐de‐doo
is Swahili

02:27.580 --> 02:29.846
for "I've always been
your best friend?"

02:32.613 --> 02:36.713
And did I mention that all of my
friends are over four feet tall?

02:40.780 --> 02:43.346
Overton, now you knows
as I helped you peel

02:43.413 --> 02:45.180
all those labels off those
shaving cream cans

02:45.246 --> 02:47.813
that I'm entitled
to half that money.

02:47.880 --> 02:50.813
Kyle, you only
peeled off one.

02:51.980 --> 02:53.580
Undoubtedly the winner.

02:55.613 --> 02:58.513
Overton, this is happening
because all of your planets

02:58.580 --> 03:00.520
are in harmonic alignment.

03:01.786 --> 03:02.853
You haven't been talkin' to them

03:02.920 --> 03:04.786
Dionne Warwick people again,
have you?

03:06.620 --> 03:09.053
No, as a matter of fact,
I've been reading

03:09.120 --> 03:11.053
"The Cheyenne Predictions."

03:12.320 --> 03:14.820
Published by
The Warwick Press.

03:22.320 --> 03:23.686
Yeah.

03:23.753 --> 03:26.353
Yeah, Obie, see?
Now, you got the technique.

03:26.420 --> 03:29.586
Now, all you have to do
is visualize two things.

03:29.653 --> 03:32.453
One, the ball going in the net.

03:32.520 --> 03:35.053
Two, givin' some of
that prize money

03:35.120 --> 03:36.720
to a needy magazine.

03:38.453 --> 03:39.853
Yeah. Khadijah, if I win

03:39.920 --> 03:42.520
I'll give Flavor
all the prize money.

03:45.886 --> 03:47.220
Look at that,
still hit the bucket

03:47.286 --> 03:49.220
even when I'm lyin' like a rug.

03:55.453 --> 03:58.453
Excuse me. Mind if I shoot
around with you?

03:58.520 --> 04:02.793
Oh, sorry, bro, but I'm under
some big dollar pressure here.

04:03.626 --> 04:05.160
Overton.

04:05.226 --> 04:07.626
Alonzo Mourning.

04:07.693 --> 04:09.726
No, no, not Alonzo.

04:09.793 --> 04:11.893
I'm like, they more like
a Reggie Miller

04:11.960 --> 04:14.826
Michael Jordan combination.

04:14.893 --> 04:17.660
See, what you have to understand
is that..

04:17.726 --> 04:21.493
Uh, there's really no reason for
me to complete this sentence.

04:22.693 --> 04:24.793
Hey, Alonzo. Zo.

04:24.860 --> 04:27.693
I'm Khadijah James,
publisher of Flavor Magazine.

04:27.760 --> 04:29.026
Listen, if you're not too busy

04:29.093 --> 04:30.593
maybe we can schedule
an interview.

04:30.660 --> 04:32.726
Khadijah James?

04:32.793 --> 04:34.726
The one who dumped Grant Hill?

04:37.393 --> 04:38.993
Yeah, that's me.

04:40.493 --> 04:43.193
Man, his game hasn't
been the same since.

04:43.260 --> 04:45.826
He's written some beautiful
sonatas though.

04:47.293 --> 04:48.893
Excuse me, uh, Mr. Zo.

04:48.960 --> 04:50.626
Uh, think
you can give me some tips

04:50.693 --> 04:53.326
on how to hit some
three‐pointers under pressure.

04:53.393 --> 04:56.860
I usually go for a combination
of Michael Jordan..

04:56.926 --> 04:58.360
...Reggie Miller?

05:00.666 --> 05:02.200
So, Zo, what about
the interview?

05:02.266 --> 05:04.200
I think I'm gonna have to pass.

05:04.266 --> 05:06.666
According to Grant,
an interview with you

05:06.733 --> 05:09.166
is like a one‐way ticket
to Dumpsville.

05:18.966 --> 05:20.200
Yeah.

05:21.266 --> 05:23.866
‐ Hey!
‐ Hey, sweet potato.

05:26.066 --> 05:28.000
We were going for
12 in a row.

05:28.066 --> 05:29.600
Well, my release is off.

05:29.666 --> 05:32.200
Would you like something cold
to drink from the soda machine?

05:32.266 --> 05:35.133
Uh, yeah. You know,
I love a frosty root beer

05:35.200 --> 05:37.466
but, uh, better make it
apple juice.

05:37.533 --> 05:39.366
Hate to have a afternoon
of bloating.

05:39.433 --> 05:40.366
(Synclaire)
'Okay.'

05:41.800 --> 05:43.666
Alright, now, Obie,
take your time, right?

05:43.733 --> 05:45.833
‐ And find your rhythm.
‐ Alright.

05:48.033 --> 05:49.800
‐ Yeah, now we're rockin'.
‐ 'Way to go.'

05:49.866 --> 05:52.466
‐ Yeah, now we're rockin'.
‐ Yeah.

05:56.200 --> 05:57.166
[grunts]

05:59.500 --> 06:00.773
You haven't made a shot yet?

06:00.840 --> 06:03.106
If you do that on Saturday,
that's no good.

06:05.040 --> 06:07.473
Why, he didn't start puttin' up
bricks until you came in.

06:07.540 --> 06:10.573
Oh, my God,
I know what's happening here.

06:10.640 --> 06:14.906
I am sucking up all of your
positive transcendental energy.

06:16.140 --> 06:18.673
‐ But jinx.
‐ Oh.

06:18.740 --> 06:20.873
Come on, girl,
I come from a long line

06:20.940 --> 06:22.906
of very superstitious people.

06:22.973 --> 06:24.840
To this day,
anybody in the Jones family

06:24.906 --> 06:27.206
that feels a stroke
of bad luck comin' on

06:27.273 --> 06:29.040
they stomp their left foot
three times

06:29.106 --> 06:30.873
to wake up our guardian angel

06:30.940 --> 06:34.040
that spins around in a circle
to make the devil feel dizzy.

06:35.873 --> 06:38.773
‐ You, my love, are no jinx.
‐ 'Alright, now, hold up.'

06:38.840 --> 06:40.773
Let's try this again
with Synclaire in the hall.

06:40.840 --> 06:41.940
‐ Okay.
‐ Come on.

06:48.173 --> 06:51.606
‐ Okay, Obie, she's gone.
‐ Alright.

06:53.973 --> 06:55.673
Ah! See that, Khadijah.

06:55.740 --> 06:58.240
I missed it by a mile and a half
and Synclaire wasn't even..

06:58.306 --> 06:59.646
Damn!

07:06.046 --> 07:07.413
Regine, I'm desperate!

07:07.480 --> 07:09.446
A dress like that
is gonna cost me $2000.

07:09.513 --> 07:10.980
I'm not spending
that type of money

07:11.046 --> 07:13.380
on a dress
I'm only gonna wear once!

07:13.446 --> 07:15.746
So, buy an expensive gown

07:15.813 --> 07:17.013
wear it tonight

07:17.080 --> 07:20.180
and then sell it to a hooker
with similar taste.

07:25.280 --> 07:26.613
Hey, sweet pea, I..

07:26.680 --> 07:28.013
I got some good news and

07:28.080 --> 07:29.780
I got some bad news.

07:29.846 --> 07:31.380
Bad news? How bad?

07:31.446 --> 07:32.913
Hmm, not bad at all.

07:32.980 --> 07:35.246
Actually for bad news,
it's pretty good.

07:35.313 --> 07:38.413
It's just bad news 'cause it's
not as good as the good news.

07:41.113 --> 07:42.446
Okay, good.

07:42.513 --> 07:44.013
Well, bad news is

07:44.080 --> 07:46.746
I don't think we're gonna make
that $10,000 tonight.

07:46.813 --> 07:48.080
'Cause I just got back
from the gym

07:48.146 --> 07:51.213
shootin' baskets for over hour,
didn't hit one.

07:51.280 --> 07:52.546
Which is sort of the good news

07:52.613 --> 07:53.646
'cause that still proves

07:53.713 --> 07:56.246
that you are my lady luck.

07:56.313 --> 07:57.846
[sobbing]

07:59.913 --> 08:02.386
Uh, I don't mean to be
politically incorrect

08:02.453 --> 08:04.720
but, uh, is this hormonal?

08:07.786 --> 08:09.086
No.

08:09.153 --> 08:10.753
It's photographical.

08:11.853 --> 08:14.020
How so?

08:14.086 --> 08:17.286
This morning I put this in here
and I didn't tell you.

08:17.353 --> 08:19.553
Even a picture of me
holding a four‐leaf clover

08:19.620 --> 08:22.220
with my fingers and eyes crossed
is bad luck.

08:27.286 --> 08:28.386
Oh, Obie

08:28.453 --> 08:30.820
this is the thing you've been
shaving so hard for

08:30.886 --> 08:32.253
and I can't even help you.

08:33.520 --> 08:35.553
Baby, look, the only help
I need from you

08:35.620 --> 08:37.486
is just to be there, baby,
that's all.

08:37.553 --> 08:38.885
Yeah, but if I'm at the Garden

08:38.953 --> 08:41.320
you're gonna miss your shot,
I'm not going.

08:41.385 --> 08:44.053
Look, girl, nobody
or nothing is gonna convince me

08:44.120 --> 08:45.286
that you are a jinx.

08:47.353 --> 08:48.553
Aren't you goin' after her?

08:49.386 --> 08:50.653
Just a second.

08:53.153 --> 08:55.086
[thumping]

08:56.353 --> 08:57.420
That's better.

08:57.486 --> 08:59.660
Now, come on, baby,
you know I love you.

09:07.960 --> 09:09.193
[door opens]

09:12.593 --> 09:15.826
Hey, baby, come on, you're..

09:15.893 --> 09:17.060
...finally home, huh?

09:17.926 --> 09:19.760
Uh, have you changed your mind?

09:19.826 --> 09:22.060
No, Obie, I'm still not going.

09:22.126 --> 09:23.460
Come on, Synclaire.

09:23.526 --> 09:26.560
You've been with me for all
of my recent major life events.

09:26.626 --> 09:28.693
You were there
when I bought a 290.

09:28.760 --> 09:31.660
You were there when we met
two out of the three "Pet Boys."

09:31.726 --> 09:33.326
I mean..

09:33.393 --> 09:35.493
Hell, you were there
when we first made love.

09:38.426 --> 09:40.993
Hey, kids, Regine around?

09:41.060 --> 09:43.426
No, she went
to the store with Khadijah.

09:43.493 --> 09:45.660
Perfect.

09:45.726 --> 09:47.560
Hey, Max, don't you have to
get ready to go

09:47.626 --> 09:49.160
to that big shindig
over at the mayor's?

09:49.226 --> 09:50.826
Yeah, yeah,
I'm on my way, shut up.

09:53.526 --> 09:54.626
Overton

09:54.693 --> 09:56.393
if you miss that shot
because of me

09:56.460 --> 09:57.560
you're never going
to get to build

09:57.626 --> 09:59.526
your beautiful
little dream house.

09:59.593 --> 10:01.666
Oh, girl,
the important thing here

10:01.733 --> 10:03.233
isn't some place I dreamed about

10:03.300 --> 10:06.233
ever since I weather‐sealed
my baby sister's doll house.

10:07.366 --> 10:08.933
The important thing is us.

10:09.000 --> 10:10.433
You and me

10:10.500 --> 10:11.766
together forever

10:11.833 --> 10:12.800
come what may.

10:12.866 --> 10:14.500
So, if you're not goin'

10:14.566 --> 10:15.633
I'm not goin'.

10:15.700 --> 10:17.166
Obie..

10:17.233 --> 10:20.266
Girlie, without you by my side

10:20.333 --> 10:21.333
ain't enough money in the world

10:21.400 --> 10:23.333
to get me
to Madison Square Garden.

10:26.666 --> 10:27.933
Hey, kids.

10:31.333 --> 10:32.600
Regine home yet?

10:33.600 --> 10:34.600
No.

10:34.666 --> 10:35.933
Goodnight.

10:40.466 --> 10:41.866
‐ 'Nice dress.'
‐ Yeah.

10:41.933 --> 10:43.066
Now, convince Overton

10:43.133 --> 10:44.700
he's got to get
shot tonight.

10:45.466 --> 10:47.366
[sighs]
Overton!

10:47.433 --> 10:48.933
Did you sign a contract?

10:49.000 --> 10:50.900
‐ Just a one.
‐ Oh, good.

10:50.966 --> 10:53.233
That means they can
only sue your ass once.

10:55.566 --> 10:56.966
‐ 'I'm home!'
‐ Okay.

10:57.033 --> 10:58.966
I gotta go. I gotta get
on a good foot. Alright?

11:03.340 --> 11:06.073
Okay, Synclaire, we got
your favorite dog movies.

11:06.140 --> 11:07.673
"Benji" and "Cujo."

11:08.373 --> 11:09.806
[knocking on door]

11:09.873 --> 11:11.673
Alright, alright, come on,
let's go, let's go.

11:11.740 --> 11:13.540
Man, Synclaire still won't go.

11:14.573 --> 11:15.573
So?

11:16.973 --> 11:18.573
When you win slip her
a couple of bucks.

11:18.640 --> 11:19.873
Come on, time's a‐wastin'.

11:19.940 --> 11:20.973
Okay, hold up, wait for me.

11:21.040 --> 11:22.273
I just gotta go
and get my jacket.

11:22.340 --> 11:23.773
You're wearin' it.

11:23.840 --> 11:25.473
[chuckles]
No!

11:25.540 --> 11:28.140
This clashes
with the seats at the Garden.

11:32.140 --> 11:33.273
Look here, honey loves.

11:33.340 --> 11:35.040
You know I would never go
without you

11:35.106 --> 11:37.906
if not for the threat
of litigation, right?

11:37.973 --> 11:39.006
Don't you worry, Obie

11:39.073 --> 11:40.906
I'm gonna
be with you there in spirit.

11:40.973 --> 11:42.240
I made you something.

11:47.240 --> 11:48.506
"Goobie?"

11:50.740 --> 11:52.506
Uh, Synclaire.

11:52.573 --> 11:54.040
As, um..

11:54.973 --> 11:56.206
...touching

11:56.273 --> 11:57.806
a gesture as this is.

11:58.740 --> 12:00.040
And since anything you do

12:00.106 --> 12:01.913
seem to disrupt
Overton's shooting

12:01.980 --> 12:03.913
uh, I think not.

12:03.980 --> 12:06.446
And, look, don't even think
about watching the game on TV.

12:06.513 --> 12:08.380
Not that I believe in
any of this mojo

12:08.446 --> 12:09.613
but we are talking about

12:09.680 --> 12:12.213
ten thousand tax free dollars.

12:12.280 --> 12:13.513
How do you know
it's tax‐free, Kyle?

12:13.580 --> 12:15.280
I'll find a way, let's go.

12:16.246 --> 12:18.246
[Regine screaming]

12:18.313 --> 12:21.080
I can't believe
Max took that dress!

12:22.413 --> 12:23.913
And yet you believe
she'll give it back

12:23.980 --> 12:25.246
when you ask for it?

12:26.713 --> 12:29.713
I'm not asking her,
I'm warning her.

12:29.780 --> 12:31.713
God, I wasn't supposed
to talk about this

12:31.780 --> 12:34.113
but Shelly,
the one‐eyed architect

12:34.180 --> 12:37.980
is gonna be the victim of
a fatal catfight in Palo Alto.

12:38.046 --> 12:41.013
I had to rig the dress
to make it a tear‐away.

12:41.080 --> 12:42.946
If anyone
so much as tugs on it

12:43.013 --> 12:44.946
eh, the dress'll
just fall apart.

12:54.613 --> 12:55.913
Let's roll!

12:59.413 --> 13:00.853
‐ Well, goodbye, sweet pea.
‐ Hey, hey, come on, come on.

13:00.920 --> 13:02.520
None of that, none of that,
none of that!

13:07.886 --> 13:09.986
[grunting]

13:14.686 --> 13:16.553
[cheering]

13:17.720 --> 13:19.420
‐ Mr. Jones?
‐ Yes.

13:19.486 --> 13:21.620
Ray Brunger,
Director of Public Relations

13:21.686 --> 13:23.120
from McColgan Industries.

13:23.186 --> 13:24.320
Welcome to you.

13:24.386 --> 13:26.120
Your complimentary guest

13:26.186 --> 13:29.120
and your other complimentary
guests.

13:29.186 --> 13:32.020
Um.. If there is a problem,
I'd be happy to pay for 'em.

13:32.086 --> 13:34.053
Oh, nonsense,
this is the VIP room

13:34.120 --> 13:35.453
and that means you

13:35.520 --> 13:36.953
and apparently them.

13:38.820 --> 13:40.720
Anyway, the contest
is pretty straightforward.

13:40.786 --> 13:42.253
At halftime
we'll go out there

13:42.320 --> 13:43.520
you hit the shot

13:43.586 --> 13:45.120
everyone goes home happy.

13:45.186 --> 13:46.453
Any questions?

13:46.520 --> 13:47.853
Yeah, I got a question.

13:47.920 --> 13:50.653
Whose idea
was that coconut deodorant?

13:50.720 --> 13:53.486
Man, on a hot day
that smells like a pina colada.

13:55.353 --> 13:57.986
How would you like
a free gift with purchase

13:58.053 --> 13:59.253
without purchase?

13:59.320 --> 14:01.393
Well, let's see
what we got here.

14:01.460 --> 14:04.460
"Official cologne of
the 1984 Olympic.."

14:04.526 --> 14:06.760
Get‐get out of here.

14:06.826 --> 14:10.793
Yo, Mr. Brunger. Um..
do I had to wear the hat?

14:10.860 --> 14:12.360
I mean,
don't take this the wrong way

14:12.426 --> 14:14.993
but this really looks goofy.

14:16.560 --> 14:19.026
Designed the thing myself,
nobody ever wants to wear it.

14:19.093 --> 14:21.193
Why should I take that
the wrong way?

14:23.226 --> 14:24.526
Yo, shorty.

14:24.593 --> 14:27.126
I don't think I can do this
without Synclaire here.

14:28.593 --> 14:30.926
Look, Obie, you have
a chance to shoot one ball

14:30.993 --> 14:33.960
make $10,000 and hand it
over to me to invest.

14:34.026 --> 14:35.360
Now, uh, don't you think
you're being a little

14:35.426 --> 14:36.726
selfish about this?

14:38.726 --> 14:41.726
I think this calls
for a woman's perspective.

14:41.793 --> 14:42.960
Fine.

14:46.060 --> 14:49.060
Check it out, Obie,
I got my press pass

14:49.126 --> 14:51.660
now, what do we say, we go down
to the Knicks' locker room

14:51.726 --> 14:53.526
just kick it with the players

14:53.593 --> 14:56.160
take your mind off of things.

14:56.226 --> 14:58.560
How's that
suppose to cheer me up?

14:58.626 --> 14:59.866
I don't know

14:59.933 --> 15:01.633
but it'll sure
make me feel better

15:01.700 --> 15:03.966
if I see John Starks
in a strap.

15:05.966 --> 15:07.833
Hm.

15:07.900 --> 15:09.700
I feel so awful, mommy.

15:09.766 --> 15:11.033
I mean, why did
this have to happen

15:11.100 --> 15:13.133
just before Overton
takes his big shot?

15:15.000 --> 15:17.833
What do you mean I've always
been a‐a basketball jinx?

15:19.633 --> 15:21.666
My high school team
going 0 and 32

15:21.733 --> 15:24.433
had nothing to do with me
going to every single game.

15:38.200 --> 15:40.400
Mom, I‐I'll call you back.

15:43.333 --> 15:46.866
Um, Max, I‐I'm no fashion guru

15:46.933 --> 15:50.666
but, uh, that whole
jacket‐around‐the‐waist

15:50.733 --> 15:54.000
torn‐dress look
is really not workin' for you.

15:54.066 --> 15:57.033
You will not <i>believe..</i>

16:01.440 --> 16:03.306
...what happened.

16:03.373 --> 16:05.240
I was standing there

16:05.306 --> 16:06.906
sippin' my drink

16:06.973 --> 16:09.640
when Tony Randall himself

16:09.706 --> 16:11.873
asked me to cha cha.

16:17.740 --> 16:20.106
After just one <i>cha</i>

16:20.173 --> 16:22.240
the whole dress rips apart.

16:22.306 --> 16:24.873
The sleeve, the strap..

16:24.940 --> 16:28.206
Thank God,
I decided to wear a bra.

16:29.740 --> 16:31.840
Maxine is gonna kill me

16:31.906 --> 16:34.440
when she sees
what I've done to her dress.

16:34.506 --> 16:37.073
Whoa, whoa, now, Max,
I‐I don't think so.

16:37.140 --> 16:39.040
She rigged that dress
to fall apart

16:39.106 --> 16:42.540
for a fatal catfight scene
in Palo Alto.

16:44.940 --> 16:47.473
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
Okay, wait a minute.

16:47.540 --> 16:49.006
You mean,
that little jackal knew

16:49.073 --> 16:50.673
that this was going to happen?

16:51.940 --> 16:54.540
And she didn't try to warn me?

16:54.606 --> 16:55.773
Oh, now, come on, Max, you did

16:55.840 --> 16:57.906
take the dress
without her permission.

16:57.973 --> 16:59.880
Besides jackals
are very important part

16:59.946 --> 17:01.313
of our food chain.

17:01.380 --> 17:02.680
Oh, yeah.

17:02.746 --> 17:04.945
Well, you can't just leave
carcasses lying all around.

17:05.012 --> 17:06.346
Come on.

17:08.746 --> 17:09.980
[sighs]

17:11.646 --> 17:13.813
Well, that, that little scamp.

17:15.813 --> 17:19.113
She certainly knows
how to pull a practical joke.

17:19.180 --> 17:20.980
Oh, well, see you tomorrow.

17:22.012 --> 17:23.646
Um, Max, you're scaring me

17:23.713 --> 17:25.480
you seem a little too calm.

17:25.546 --> 17:29.113
Well, uh, that's how
you get sometimes

17:29.180 --> 17:32.246
when your soul is settled and..

17:32.313 --> 17:34.080
you know what must be done.

17:38.746 --> 17:39.946
[upbeat music]

17:40.013 --> 17:41.513
Look at them cheerleaders

17:41.580 --> 17:44.346
shaking their entire
groove thing.

17:44.413 --> 17:47.913
But, who would want to be
a professional cheerleader?

17:47.980 --> 17:49.913
Didn't you try out
for that squad?

17:51.613 --> 17:52.980
That was four years ago

17:53.046 --> 17:56.613
when cheerleading
was about something.

17:56.680 --> 17:59.146
(male announcer)
'And, now, get set
for our halftime feature.'

18:02.420 --> 18:05.253
'brought to you by McColgan.'

18:05.320 --> 18:07.653
Mr. Jones, let me just
explain something to you.

18:07.720 --> 18:10.086
If you hit this shot,
I'm a star.

18:10.153 --> 18:12.353
If you launch the ball
into the seventh row

18:12.420 --> 18:13.520
I'm on the street.

18:13.586 --> 18:15.753
So, relax, enjoy.

18:15.820 --> 18:17.053
No pressure.

18:19.853 --> 18:21.686
Look, don't listen to him,
Overton.

18:21.753 --> 18:24.353
I mean, he probably has
never even dribbled a ball.

18:24.420 --> 18:25.920
He has no idea how hard it is

18:25.986 --> 18:27.420
to get up in front
of 20,000 people

18:27.486 --> 18:29.920
and make a shot that
even the pros can't make.

18:31.553 --> 18:32.953
Am I helping at all?

18:34.086 --> 18:35.686
Yeah, who cares,
if I make that shot

18:35.753 --> 18:37.320
without girlie by my side

18:37.386 --> 18:39.020
the money's meaningless.

18:39.086 --> 18:41.486
Overton, I would agree
with you 100 percent

18:41.553 --> 18:44.053
if you weren't
so incredibly wrong.

18:46.053 --> 18:48.920
Overton, it's show time.

18:48.986 --> 18:50.386
‐ Alright. Yeah!
‐ Okay!

18:50.453 --> 18:52.386
‐ Overton! Yeah! Go Obie!
‐ Come on. Come on.

18:52.453 --> 18:55.286
Goobie! Goobie!

Mr. Overton Wakefield Jones!

[hooting]

19:17.060 --> 19:19.193
One shot!

19:19.260 --> 19:20.826
One shot
from the three‐point line

19:20.893 --> 19:23.926
for $10,000.

19:23.993 --> 19:26.426
Overton, good luck.

19:31.060 --> 19:33.093
This one's for you, Synclaire.

19:39.526 --> 19:42.460
[screaming]

19:43.560 --> 19:45.293
Yeah! Oh, oh, oh..

19:45.360 --> 19:46.560
[howling]

19:46.626 --> 19:48.760
‐ Overton Wakefield Jones!
‐ Yes!

19:48.826 --> 19:51.693
The ten grand is yours,
what do you say?

19:51.760 --> 19:54.726
Uh, McColgan's not just
a shaving cream

19:54.793 --> 19:57.393
but a way of life?

19:57.460 --> 19:59.160
Yeah! Alright!

19:59.226 --> 20:01.166
Ten thousand dollars!

20:01.233 --> 20:03.200
Yes, yes, yes! I've got
Synclaire on the phone.

20:03.266 --> 20:04.600
‐ Who?
‐ Synclaire, Synclaire.

20:04.666 --> 20:07.233
Oh, cool.
Synclaire, baby, I did it.

20:07.300 --> 20:09.366
Turn on the TV. I did it!

20:09.433 --> 20:12.366
Really? I can't believe it.

20:12.433 --> 20:15.533
Yeah! Yeah, baby,
I won the money, honey.

20:15.600 --> 20:17.300
Oh, yeah, and check this out.

20:20.933 --> 20:24.700
Oh, my God, Obie.
This means I'm not a jinx.

20:24.766 --> 20:26.366
I mean, I look bad
on that t‐shirt

20:26.433 --> 20:29.333
but that's not
really luck related.

20:29.400 --> 20:30.700
A jinx?

20:30.766 --> 20:32.700
Baby, finding you
was the luckiest thing

20:32.766 --> 20:34.100
that ever happened to me.

20:34.166 --> 20:35.300

'Here's your check!'

20:35.366 --> 20:36.433
[grunts]

20:38.533 --> 20:40.633
Sorry, uh, you know,
it's the first time

20:40.700 --> 20:42.000
that's ever happened.

20:42.066 --> 20:44.100
‐ Obie, hang up the phone.
‐ Oh.

20:44.166 --> 20:45.733
It's money, hang up the phone.
Thank you.

20:48.000 --> 20:49.500

the ten grand is yours!'

20:55.100 --> 20:56.833
'What do you say?'

21:00.006 --> 21:01.006
‐ Max..
‐ 'Uh, uh..'

21:01.073 --> 21:02.206
Before you say anything

21:02.273 --> 21:04.840
I came here to apologize.

21:04.906 --> 21:06.773
I know that you didn't tell me
that dress was rigged

21:06.840 --> 21:08.140
and that was pretty low.

21:08.206 --> 21:10.140
‐ No‐‐
‐ 'But I deserved it.'

21:11.606 --> 21:14.873
Should've never taken that dress
without your permission.

21:14.940 --> 21:17.873
I've spent the last four hours
sewing it back together.

21:24.373 --> 21:26.506
Oh, my.. Max.

21:27.773 --> 21:30.340
Oh, God.
I don't know what to say.

21:30.406 --> 21:34.006
[sighs]
Well, I know you take your job
very seriously

21:34.073 --> 21:36.573
and I didn't want to do
anything to jeopardize it.

21:39.806 --> 21:40.773
Thanks.

21:42.540 --> 21:44.573
I'll, um..

21:44.640 --> 21:45.940
I'll go make us some coffee.

21:46.006 --> 21:47.440
Alright, you do that.

21:52.706 --> 21:55.140
Maxine, I'm so proud of you.

21:55.206 --> 21:58.306
Yeah, well, right is right.

21:58.373 --> 22:00.180
Of course, it didn't stop me
from letting the air

22:00.246 --> 22:02.546
out of her tires and putting
sugar in her gas tank.

22:04.546 --> 22:05.980
Stealing her distributer cap.

22:07.146 --> 22:09.080
Ugh.

22:09.146 --> 22:10.446
Canceling her credit cards

22:10.513 --> 22:13.080
ordering two dozen pizzas
to be delivered in the morning.

22:13.146 --> 22:15.713
[sniffles]
And fixing her up with RuPaul.

22:18.380 --> 22:20.346
Let's go get a cup of joe,
alright?

22:22.980 --> 22:24.013
Woo‐hoo!

22:24.080 --> 22:25.046
[giggles]
