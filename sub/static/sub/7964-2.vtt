WEBVTT

00:16.080 --> 00:18.080
CAROLINE: Would you rather be British or French?

00:18.280 --> 00:19.320
ALL: British.

00:20.160 --> 00:22.560
I couldn't end my time as governor of Saint-Marie

00:22.600 --> 00:24.120
without putting this all-important question

00:24.160 --> 00:25.960
to the population of Spinner's Rock.

00:27.520 --> 00:28.640
"British and proud of it,"

00:29.120 --> 00:30.200
said a hawksbill.

00:31.360 --> 00:32.840
"God save the Queen,"

00:33.160 --> 00:34.360
sang a parrotfish.

00:35.440 --> 00:40.160
"You can't trust the French as far as you can throw them."

00:41.240 --> 00:42.200
That was a sea snake.

00:43.000 --> 00:46.360
Our friend from Saint-Robert, General Council

00:43.000 --> 00:46.360
President Tromeur,

00:46.640 --> 00:50.400
insists Spinner's Rock is French.

00:46.640 --> 00:50.400
But I am very clear.

00:50.640 --> 00:53.360
It became British 200 years ago

00:53.400 --> 00:56.240
and nothing has changed since then.

00:59.320 --> 01:04.120
Saint-Marie, you have given me four unforgettable years.

01:04.360 --> 01:08.280
My posting may be ending, but my successor,

01:08.320 --> 01:09.640
and indeed Britain,

01:09.760 --> 01:13.080
will continue to look after your best interests.

01:13.880 --> 01:18.400
And I promise, I will carry

01:13.880 --> 01:18.400
the beauty of your island

01:19.120 --> 01:20.360
and your people

01:21.040 --> 01:22.880
in my heart forever.

01:24.360 --> 01:26.160
Thank you.

01:31.280 --> 01:32.520
Message received?

01:32.640 --> 01:34.040
He was listening to every word.

01:34.920 --> 01:36.720
Well, let's hope he reaches the right conclusion.

01:36.760 --> 01:39.320
Sea snake was inspired, by the way, Ellery.

01:39.360 --> 01:40.560
Thank you.

01:40.680 --> 01:42.040
Perfectly judged to the last, Governor.

01:42.080 --> 01:43.240
Thank you, Selwyn.

01:44.240 --> 01:45.920
Gosh, I could do with a drink.

01:46.040 --> 01:47.840
Oh, allow me.

01:50.400 --> 01:51.880
"Sea snake"?

01:53.080 --> 01:55.360
For some reason, I thought you were

01:53.080 --> 01:55.360
better than that.

01:55.760 --> 01:58.280
I'm delighted to disappoint you

01:55.760 --> 01:58.280
one last time, Francois.

02:00.080 --> 02:04.720
You British complain about having lost

02:00.080 --> 02:04.720
your identity in the world.

02:05.160 --> 02:06.480
Well, I disagree.

02:06.520 --> 02:08.800
You're just as hypocritical as you ever were.

02:08.960 --> 02:12.480
On the contrary, I have been

02:08.960 --> 02:12.480
entirely straight with you.

02:13.080 --> 02:15.040
Withdraw France's claim to Spinner's Rock

02:15.080 --> 02:16.280
before I get on that plane

02:16.720 --> 02:18.040
or we both know what will happen.

02:19.840 --> 02:20.960
Ah!

02:24.280 --> 02:25.480
I'll, er,

02:26.560 --> 02:28.160
go and check on the canapes.

02:47.160 --> 02:48.360
Thank you.

02:51.440 --> 02:53.000
Ms Preville, I do apologise.

02:53.280 --> 02:54.440
It's fine. It's fine.

02:58.440 --> 03:00.680
Er, a little something to remember me by, Governor.

03:01.520 --> 03:02.640
Oh...

03:05.920 --> 03:07.560
It's, er, Saint-Marie pavement.

03:08.120 --> 03:10.360
I'm kidding. It's a piece of

03:08.120 --> 03:10.360
Spinner's Rock.

03:12.320 --> 03:14.800
Thank you, Andy, that is very thoughtful.

03:15.560 --> 03:17.120
You'll be missed, you know that?

03:18.200 --> 03:19.640
My drink.

03:19.920 --> 03:22.360
Excuse me. Lucy?

03:24.080 --> 03:26.240
You'd better not be going back to the office.

03:27.160 --> 03:29.760
Well, take the night off, Lucy, for God's sake.

03:29.800 --> 03:31.320
I've got to finish that detail.

03:31.360 --> 03:33.000
Well, at least stay for the food.

03:33.120 --> 03:34.960
Show Caroline a bit of respect.

03:40.200 --> 03:41.600
To you, Governor.

03:41.720 --> 03:43.280
God, I need this.

03:46.360 --> 03:48.120
-Of course.

03:52.480 --> 03:55.160
Ladies... Ladies and gentlemen,

03:55.800 --> 03:58.880
I would like to add a few brief words of my own

03:58.960 --> 04:00.120
to the evening's tribute.

04:01.280 --> 04:02.200
Governor Bamber,

04:02.640 --> 04:04.840
you leave this island a wealthier,

04:04.960 --> 04:07.240
more confident and safer place.

04:07.520 --> 04:08.760
-And for that, I... -Ah!

04:11.480 --> 04:12.480
Oh!

04:13.000 --> 04:16.880
Ah! Someone get a doctor, now!

04:16.920 --> 04:18.440
-ANDY: Governor's residence,

04:18.480 --> 04:19.960
we need an ambulance, now.

04:20.000 --> 04:21.920
Ellery, what's happening?

04:27.760 --> 04:28.880
No.

04:29.520 --> 04:30.520
No.

04:30.560 --> 04:31.720
No!

05:02.560 --> 05:04.320
HUMPHREY: Question 98.

05:04.600 --> 05:08.400
"What is your ideal body type for your perfect partner?"

05:08.440 --> 05:10.480
"I don't mind."

05:10.720 --> 05:14.680
No, Chief, that makes you

05:10.720 --> 05:14.680
sound desperate.

05:14.720 --> 05:15.840
Okay.

05:16.400 --> 05:18.680
"I have an open mind."

05:19.200 --> 05:20.120
Right, question 99,

05:20.440 --> 05:22.080
"How would you characterise the end

05:22.200 --> 05:23.760
"of most of your romantic relationships?"

05:23.800 --> 05:25.640
"Painful divorce." Last question...

05:27.560 --> 05:29.040
Don't you think you might be

05:27.560 --> 05:29.040
answering those questions a little bit too honestly?

05:30.840 --> 05:32.600
Well, yes, but I'm hardly going to find

05:32.720 --> 05:34.520
my perfect partner by lying, am I?

05:34.560 --> 05:36.520
Er, right, question 100,

05:36.840 --> 05:39.600
"How organised are you?"

05:39.640 --> 05:41.280
Highly organised, wouldn't you say, Dwayne?

05:41.800 --> 05:42.800
Yes, Chief.

05:43.640 --> 05:45.840
HUMPHREY: Right, I think that's ready to send.

05:52.720 --> 05:53.840
-COMMISSIONER:

05:52.720 --> 05:53.840
<i>Chief Inspector?</i>

05:54.120 --> 05:55.280
Oh, Commissioner.

05:55.720 --> 05:56.800
Good evening.

05:56.920 --> 05:58.160
<i>We have a bit of a problem.</i>

06:08.200 --> 06:09.200
Evening, J.P., Florence.

06:09.240 --> 06:10.400
Sir.

06:13.360 --> 06:16.120
So, Dwayne was round at yours this evening, then, sir?

06:16.280 --> 06:19.440
Er, yes, we were, er... Well, actually, he was, erm...

06:19.480 --> 06:21.000
What were you doing

06:21.040 --> 06:24.880
-Painting. Shelf. -Shelf. Putting up a shelf.

06:33.280 --> 06:34.520
Sir?

06:34.640 --> 06:35.960
Ah, Inspector.

06:36.560 --> 06:37.760
Everything under control?

06:38.560 --> 06:41.640
No one has touched the body except for the paramedics

06:42.120 --> 06:44.000
and the doctor, who's on his way.

06:44.120 --> 06:45.840
Thank you, sir. Most helpful.

06:46.600 --> 06:50.120
J.P., Dwayne, go and get names, addresses,

06:46.600 --> 06:50.120
statements and photos, please.

06:50.160 --> 06:51.920
-Chief. -Yes, Chief.

06:55.560 --> 06:57.000
Bitter almond.

06:57.040 --> 06:58.760
That and the redness in the skin.

06:58.800 --> 06:59.800
Cyanide?

07:00.600 --> 07:02.840
In her glass, it would seem. We should take a sample.

07:05.320 --> 07:06.880
And, er, none of the other guests are ill?

07:07.200 --> 07:09.560
-COMMISSIONER: No, not that I'm aware.

07:07.200 --> 07:09.560
-HUMPHREY: Good.

07:10.120 --> 07:12.440
I don't suppose you know what Governor

07:10.120 --> 07:12.440
Bamber was drinking?

07:12.720 --> 07:14.280
Two glasses of champagne,

07:14.920 --> 07:17.240
from this bottle. I served her.

07:17.520 --> 07:18.520
Right.

07:19.000 --> 07:20.080
And they were her only drinks?

07:20.120 --> 07:21.160
Yes.

07:21.680 --> 07:22.880
COMMISSIONER: <i>When she arrived,</i>

07:23.000 --> 07:24.080
<i>she went straight</i> <i>into her speech.</i>

07:24.480 --> 07:27.160
<i>I served her</i> <i>after she'd finished speaking.</i>

07:27.200 --> 07:28.920
And where did her glass come from?

07:28.960 --> 07:29.960
From that table.

07:30.880 --> 07:33.040
-Nope.

07:34.000 --> 07:35.800
I chose it myself.

07:35.840 --> 07:36.880
HUMPHREY: And the bottle?

07:37.680 --> 07:40.520
I saw it being opened. No one else drank from it.

07:40.960 --> 07:43.120
Do you mind if I take the bottle,

07:40.960 --> 07:43.120
please, sir?

07:49.240 --> 07:51.040
Can't smell anything, let's get it to the lab.

07:51.160 --> 07:54.480
Erm...  Sir, er, I wonder

07:51.160 --> 07:54.480
if you could possibly

07:54.920 --> 07:58.400
go and check that none of the other guests

07:54.920 --> 07:58.400
are feeling unwell?

08:00.320 --> 08:02.600
-Of course. -Thank you.

08:05.480 --> 08:07.400
Phew! Awkward.

08:09.040 --> 08:12.200
Okay, six, six, seven, seven, 42.

08:14.440 --> 08:16.640
About 100 glasses here and as far as I can tell,

08:16.680 --> 08:18.320
there's no cyanide in any of them.

08:18.800 --> 08:20.520
I'll have to get them all tested,

08:18.800 --> 08:20.520
just in case.

08:20.840 --> 08:21.960
Anything in the Governor's handbag?

08:22.080 --> 08:23.200
A phone.

08:24.560 --> 08:26.400
Thank you.

08:26.440 --> 08:28.040
Plenty of texts and emails.

08:28.120 --> 08:32.120
Mints, tissues, a sealed envelope, lipstick

08:32.160 --> 08:34.520
and a piece of rock with an engraving.

08:34.760 --> 08:38.320
Erm, "For Caroline, a British jewel

08:34.760 --> 08:38.320
in the Caribbean. Andy."

08:38.520 --> 08:40.440
-Sure.

08:41.800 --> 08:43.720
There's no address on it.

08:46.080 --> 08:47.160
"Dear Caroline, please be careful.

08:47.280 --> 08:48.480
"They want to kill you before you go

08:48.520 --> 08:49.760
"because of June 10th.

08:50.360 --> 08:51.400
"A friend."

08:51.480 --> 08:53.520
Someone definitely wanted her dead.

08:53.760 --> 08:55.240
And someone else knew about it.

08:56.520 --> 08:57.560
So,

08:58.240 --> 08:59.920
the Commissioner chose the Governor's glass

08:59.960 --> 09:01.680
at random from this table.

09:01.920 --> 09:04.520
None of the other glasses, the champagne itself,

09:01.920 --> 09:04.520
contained cyanide,

09:04.760 --> 09:06.680
and as far as we're aware, no one else is sick.

09:06.800 --> 09:09.280
So, did the Commissioner happen to pick

09:06.800 --> 09:09.280
the one poisoned glass

09:09.320 --> 09:10.360
intended for the Governor?

09:10.680 --> 09:12.360
Out of 100 or so?

09:12.400 --> 09:14.480
-That would be quite a coincidence.

09:12.400 --> 09:14.480
-Right. Which means

09:14.600 --> 09:16.680
the only possible way of getting poison

09:16.720 --> 09:18.200
into the victim's glass would be...

09:18.520 --> 09:21.440
By adding it to the glass after the Commissioner

09:18.520 --> 09:21.440
picked it up

09:21.480 --> 09:22.720
off the table.

09:22.840 --> 09:24.240
Which he's not going to like.

09:24.960 --> 09:26.080
<i>Merci.</i>

09:32.760 --> 09:34.240
No one else is ill

09:34.280 --> 09:36.240
and none of the other glasses or the bottle

09:36.280 --> 09:37.480
appear to contain cyanide.

09:37.920 --> 09:40.360
So let's try and establish

09:40.400 --> 09:42.080
who could've added the cyanide to the glass

09:42.120 --> 09:43.600
once you'd given it to the Governor.

09:43.640 --> 09:45.600
So who do you remember standing nearby?

09:45.680 --> 09:46.680
No one.

09:46.840 --> 09:48.240
What about during your speech?

09:48.480 --> 09:51.440
There was never anyone within two metres

09:48.480 --> 09:51.440
of either of us.

09:52.000 --> 09:53.360
-I'm sure of it. -I see.

09:53.760 --> 09:55.160
Er, well, then perhaps the cyanide

09:55.280 --> 09:56.680
was added before you gave the glass

09:56.720 --> 09:59.120
to the Governor. Er, so let's rewind.

09:59.640 --> 10:01.560
As you were taking the glass from the table,

10:02.440 --> 10:04.240
who do you remember seeing nearby?

10:04.880 --> 10:07.680
COMMISSIONER: <i>The person near to me</i>

10:04.880 --> 10:07.680
<i>was Francois Tromeur,</i>

10:07.800 --> 10:10.720
<i>the president of</i> <i>the General Council</i>

10:07.800 --> 10:10.720
<i>of Saint-Robert.</i>

10:10.800 --> 10:11.960
Thank you.

10:12.800 --> 10:15.080
Arrogant. Untrustworthy.

10:15.680 --> 10:18.080
-A Parisian. -Right.

10:18.120 --> 10:19.880
Well, that's useful, sir. Thank you.

10:21.240 --> 10:23.440
So where was the President standing?

10:30.000 --> 10:31.040
-There. -Fine.

10:31.880 --> 10:33.680
And so where did you go with the glass after that?

10:34.280 --> 10:36.040
I brought it over to the Governor.

10:36.400 --> 10:39.120
On the way, there was a slight collision

10:36.400 --> 10:39.120
with Lucy Preville.

10:39.160 --> 10:40.680
-Er, Lucy, er... -Preville.

10:41.000 --> 10:42.200
The First Secretary.

10:42.720 --> 10:46.280
<i>She's bright,</i> <i>very hardworking.</i>

10:42.720 --> 10:46.280
<i>Rather buttoned-up.</i>

10:46.720 --> 10:48.800
Could you do the honours, please, Florence?

10:49.240 --> 10:51.280
Thank you, sir. And then?

10:51.360 --> 10:53.160
I rejoined the Governor,

10:53.200 --> 10:55.320
who was standing with Andy Hammond,

10:55.800 --> 10:57.520
the Deputy Governor.

10:58.560 --> 11:00.760
Right

11:03.040 --> 11:05.320
Mr Hammond knows a lot about the Caribbean.

11:06.040 --> 11:07.960
He's one of the proudest Brits I've ever met.

11:08.400 --> 11:12.520
After a few seconds, he headed over

11:08.400 --> 11:12.520
to Lucy Preville over there.

11:13.160 --> 11:14.280
Over there.

11:15.840 --> 11:17.520
Excuse me. Lucy?

11:19.520 --> 11:21.440
She looked like she was leaving the party.

11:21.520 --> 11:23.160
Right. So,

11:24.240 --> 11:25.720
which of these three

11:25.760 --> 11:27.520
could've dropped the cyanide into the Governor's glass

11:27.560 --> 11:30.640
in-between you picking it up from the table here

11:31.960 --> 11:33.800
and her swallowing the champagne there?

11:34.320 --> 11:36.840
None of them. I would have noticed.

11:38.040 --> 11:41.000
Yes, but might you have been distracted,

11:38.040 --> 11:41.000
sir, albeit very briefly?

11:41.160 --> 11:42.480
Absolutely not.

11:42.760 --> 11:46.040
I was in control of Governor Bamber's glass

11:42.760 --> 11:46.040
the whole time.

11:48.640 --> 11:49.960
Okay, well, that's enough for now.

11:50.000 --> 11:51.200
Let's speak to the witnesses in the morning.

11:51.600 --> 11:53.960
And also Caroline's secretary, Ellery Wallace?

11:54.160 --> 11:55.400
Let's see if he can shed light

11:55.440 --> 11:56.880
on who wrote the unopened warning letter

11:56.920 --> 11:58.160
found in her handbag.

11:58.200 --> 11:59.800
And why the 10th of June might be a reason

11:59.840 --> 12:01.080
for someone to kill the Governor.

12:01.320 --> 12:02.320
Quite right, J.P..

12:02.480 --> 12:03.720
Now, if you and Dwayne carry on

12:03.760 --> 12:04.960
with the necessary background checks,

12:05.000 --> 12:06.640
also get the prints off the letter

12:06.680 --> 12:07.760
and see if the lab can tell us

12:06.680 --> 12:07.760
anything else about it.

12:07.800 --> 12:09.400
BOTH: Yes, Chief.

12:09.440 --> 12:11.080
Ah!

12:11.600 --> 12:12.720
Er, before you go,

12:13.600 --> 12:15.400
could I possibly have a quick word?

12:16.160 --> 12:19.840
Yeah, well, first of all, erm, er,

12:16.160 --> 12:19.840
could I just say once again...

12:19.880 --> 12:21.000
What is it, Inspector? Yes, erm...

12:23.200 --> 12:26.400
To avoid you compromising

12:23.200 --> 12:26.400
our investigation,

12:27.080 --> 12:30.240
I'm afraid you will need to remain

12:27.080 --> 12:30.240
entirely excluded from it

12:30.280 --> 12:32.160
until the case is concluded. -I see.

12:34.360 --> 12:36.240
-Yeah.

12:37.600 --> 12:39.120
Thank you for telling me.

12:44.760 --> 12:46.440
Commissioner.

12:51.920 --> 12:54.440
Well, he seems to have taken that

12:51.920 --> 12:54.440
on the chin, hasn't he?

12:56.600 --> 12:57.720
Have a good evening, sir.

13:19.200 --> 13:22.040
Ah, Florence, good morning. I'm literally one

13:19.200 --> 13:22.040
set of keys away

13:22.120 --> 13:24.720
from being ready. Once I find my wallet,

13:22.120 --> 13:24.720
of course,

13:25.280 --> 13:26.680
and my jacket.

13:27.800 --> 13:30.560
So which shelf did Dwayne put up?

13:30.760 --> 13:31.800
Shelf?

13:32.600 --> 13:34.320
Oh, right, yes, er, shelf, erm...

13:34.360 --> 13:37.840
Well, er, let me see,

13:34.360 --> 13:37.840
it was, er, it was...

13:38.800 --> 13:40.000
Erm, that one.

13:40.360 --> 13:42.480
What were you two really up to last night?

13:44.080 --> 13:46.320
Well, actually, he was helping me

13:44.080 --> 13:46.320
fill in a profile.

13:47.040 --> 13:50.600
Yes, I've decided to, er, dive into

13:47.040 --> 13:50.600
the shark-infested waters

13:50.640 --> 13:51.720
of the dating world.

13:52.080 --> 13:53.000
Good for you.

13:53.680 --> 13:57.160
And Dwayne is going to be

13:53.680 --> 13:57.160
your guide, is he?

13:57.200 --> 13:58.320
Yes, absolutely, Florence.

13:58.880 --> 14:00.920
Well, if he can't get me a woman,

13:58.880 --> 14:00.920
no one can.

14:02.800 --> 14:05.520
Ah, success. Let's go.

14:09.160 --> 14:10.240
ANDY: Poison?

14:10.360 --> 14:11.480
I thought it was a heart attack.

14:12.040 --> 14:13.920
Was anyone behaving suspiciously

14:14.040 --> 14:16.040
around Caroline's champagne glass?

14:16.360 --> 14:17.520
-No. -No.

14:18.160 --> 14:19.280
What about you, Mr Wallace?

14:19.760 --> 14:21.000
What did you see?

14:21.320 --> 14:23.600
I was in the kitchen when the Commissioner served her.

14:24.200 --> 14:26.120
-LUCY: Ah! Someone

14:24.200 --> 14:26.120
get a doctor, now!

14:26.160 --> 14:28.240
ELLERY: <i> I heard Lucy scream,</i> <i>so I came running.</i>

14:28.280 --> 14:29.320
CAROLINE: Ellery, what's happening?

14:29.960 --> 14:33.600
What was Caroline like to work with

14:29.960 --> 14:33.600
or opposite?

14:34.000 --> 14:37.120
Well, she was a great diplomat and an inspiring manager.

14:37.360 --> 14:38.800
Not many of those in the Foreign Office.

14:39.280 --> 14:41.280
-LUCY: No, but...

14:42.120 --> 14:43.840
then, she was clever and competent.

14:44.000 --> 14:46.640
In my experience, that tends to

14:44.000 --> 14:46.640
frighten men off.

14:48.440 --> 14:50.160
President Tromeur?

14:50.760 --> 14:53.160
Caroline was a beautiful lady on the outside

14:53.840 --> 14:54.920
and the inside.

14:58.040 --> 14:59.840
My wife insisted I switch.

15:00.400 --> 15:03.640
They do a Cigane flavour. It's okay.

15:04.680 --> 15:07.880
So who was Caroline closest to in the office?

15:08.280 --> 15:09.320
I'd like to think it was me. LUCY: It was Ellery.

15:11.000 --> 15:12.640
She trusted him with her life.

15:13.240 --> 15:15.840
How long had you been Governor Bamber's

15:13.240 --> 15:15.840
private secretary?

15:16.280 --> 15:17.680
Almost two years.

15:18.280 --> 15:22.200
She liked that I was able to provide

15:18.280 --> 15:22.200
a local perspective on things.

15:23.400 --> 15:24.880
What was Caroline doing yesterday?

15:25.000 --> 15:28.040
She was clearing out her office, with Ellery.

15:28.720 --> 15:31.320
ELLERY: <i> There was a lot to do</i> <i>before she left.</i>

15:33.080 --> 15:35.960
Caroline was carrying this in her handbag.

15:36.320 --> 15:38.360
It was unopened and unaddressed.

15:38.720 --> 15:40.480
Do you know where she got it from?

15:40.600 --> 15:42.400
Have any of you seen it before?

15:45.320 --> 15:47.400
"Dear Caroline, please be careful.

15:47.760 --> 15:50.680
"They want to kill you before you go

15:47.760 --> 15:50.680
because of June 10th.

15:51.040 --> 15:52.240
"A friend."

15:52.480 --> 15:55.320
Any of you have any idea who could have written this?

15:56.080 --> 15:58.080
What about the reference to the 10th of June?

15:58.120 --> 16:00.680
That's the date of the battle at Spinner's Rock.

16:00.720 --> 16:02.120
Of course it is.

16:02.200 --> 16:04.600
Yes, of course, erm, Spinner's Rock.

16:02.200 --> 16:04.600
Er, remind me.

16:05.000 --> 16:08.200
It's an uninhabited rock between Saint-Marie

16:05.000 --> 16:08.200
and Saint-Robert.

16:08.800 --> 16:13.000
On June 10th, 1813, Captain Spinner

16:08.800 --> 16:13.000
won it for Britain.

16:13.480 --> 16:16.360
And now, out of the blue, the French are

16:13.480 --> 16:16.360
claiming it as theirs.

16:17.120 --> 16:19.800
The correct title is <i>la Roche de la Republique.</i>

16:20.760 --> 16:22.240
The rock is rightfully French.

16:23.720 --> 16:24.680
No, it isn't.

16:25.440 --> 16:28.480
Why would Spinner's Rock be a reason to kill

16:25.440 --> 16:28.480
Governor Bamber?

16:29.040 --> 16:30.280
I have no idea.

16:30.320 --> 16:33.320
Whole thing's handbags at 12 paces, honestly.

16:34.240 --> 16:37.240
Caroline was blackmailing President Tromeur

16:37.720 --> 16:39.040
over Spinner's Rock.

16:40.680 --> 16:41.640
What?

16:41.760 --> 16:43.400
She had given him an ultimatum.

16:43.720 --> 16:46.440
Withdraw France's claim to Spinner's Rock

16:43.720 --> 16:46.440
before I get on that plane

16:46.760 --> 16:48.440
or we both know what will happen.

16:48.960 --> 16:51.040
I thought she seemed a bit nervous.

16:51.400 --> 16:53.600
Caroline was threatening to block imports

16:53.640 --> 16:55.120
from Saint-Robert onto Saint-Marie.

16:55.280 --> 16:57.480
Reason for you to be pretty worried,

16:55.280 --> 16:57.480
I'd imagine.

16:57.520 --> 17:00.000
Our fishermen would have lost a few dollars.

17:00.040 --> 17:04.120
Painful, yes. But a reason for me

17:00.040 --> 17:04.120
to murder someone?

17:08.640 --> 17:12.080
Please excuse me, I have some VIPs

17:08.640 --> 17:12.080
waiting outside.

17:12.720 --> 17:14.200
My family.

17:23.520 --> 17:24.720
Saint-Marie there.

17:26.000 --> 17:27.160
Saint-Robert there.

17:27.440 --> 17:29.360
So where's this, er... Where's this Spinner's Rock?

17:31.680 --> 17:32.800
There.

17:33.480 --> 17:35.120
That

17:36.200 --> 17:37.520
<i>Entente cordiale</i> out the window

17:37.640 --> 17:39.200
for a dot in the middle of nowhere?

17:39.240 --> 17:40.320
Doesn't make any sense.

17:40.880 --> 17:43.000
Caroline had a serious clear-out.

17:43.320 --> 17:46.480
Some of these documents go right back

17:43.320 --> 17:46.480
to the start of her posting.

17:46.680 --> 17:48.200
Did you find out anything about Spinner's Rock?

17:48.240 --> 17:49.720
-Not yet. -Look.

17:51.280 --> 17:52.880
Report from a planning commission,

17:53.000 --> 17:54.720
minutes into the planning council,

17:55.520 --> 17:57.600
plans for a Club Caribbean holiday camp,

17:58.160 --> 18:00.240
invoice for a private security firm.

18:01.000 --> 18:02.440
"Lockdown Private Security hired

18:02.480 --> 18:04.320
"for the ongoing security of Spinner's Rock."

18:05.120 --> 18:06.240
For how much?

18:08.600 --> 18:09.880
Well, she could've had the Coast Guard

18:10.000 --> 18:11.440
or us for free to patrol that rock.

18:12.280 --> 18:14.560
So why shell out for a private security firm?

18:18.600 --> 18:21.120
So the post-mortem confirms that Caroline Bamber

18:21.160 --> 18:23.240
died from ingesting hydrogen cyanide.

18:23.600 --> 18:26.480
Concentrated hydrogen cyanide, strong enough to

18:23.600 --> 18:26.480
kill in a minute,

18:26.800 --> 18:29.600
was found in champagne samples taken from Caroline's glass,

18:29.720 --> 18:32.080
which would explain why she died

18:29.720 --> 18:32.080
almost immediately.

18:32.760 --> 18:35.000
The lab confirmed there was no trace of cyanide

18:35.040 --> 18:38.120
in any other glass, or in the champagne bottle.

18:38.560 --> 18:40.760
And the only food and drink Caroline consumed

18:40.800 --> 18:44.040
in the half hour before she died

18:40.800 --> 18:44.040
was the champagne.

18:44.160 --> 18:45.240
J.P.: Just as you thought, sir.

18:45.440 --> 18:47.080
Someone poisoned her champagne glass.

18:47.360 --> 18:50.280
Quite right, J.P., but the question is

18:47.360 --> 18:50.280
how on earth did they do it

18:50.320 --> 18:53.720
without our esteemed Commissioner spotting it?

18:53.760 --> 18:55.720
-DWAYNE: Yeah.

18:56.560 --> 18:58.560
The lab said the paper and the envelope

18:56.560 --> 18:58.560
are low quality,

18:58.600 --> 19:00.080
it can be found in any newsagent.

19:00.400 --> 19:01.960
And they can't tell us anything for certain

19:02.000 --> 19:04.360
about the computer or the printer that was used.

19:04.800 --> 19:06.600
J.P.: No fingerprints on the letter itself

19:06.720 --> 19:08.520
and only one set on the envelope,

19:08.600 --> 19:10.080
the Governor's.

19:10.120 --> 19:13.080
So it was handed to Caroline by someone wearing gloves?

19:13.200 --> 19:15.400
Or someone in gloves left it in her handbag,

19:15.440 --> 19:17.920
a place they knew she'd find it. So,

19:18.560 --> 19:21.080
who killed Caroline Bamber and why?

19:21.120 --> 19:22.760
And how did they get cyanide into her glass?

19:22.920 --> 19:27.240
Well, to help us, I have procured,

19:22.920 --> 19:27.240
at no expense at all,

19:27.760 --> 19:31.440
a highly technical piece of cutting-edge kit,

19:31.480 --> 19:32.960
my chess set.

19:33.720 --> 19:35.760
Thank you. -Er, oh...

19:36.800 --> 19:37.920
So...

19:41.560 --> 19:44.600
Caroline Bamber, Governor for

19:41.560 --> 19:44.600
the past four years.

19:45.000 --> 19:48.240
Single, respected by her colleagues,

19:45.000 --> 19:48.240
a reputation for integrity

19:48.280 --> 19:50.600
and defending the best interests

19:48.280 --> 19:50.600
of Saint-Marie.

19:51.440 --> 19:54.720
The Commissioner, bearer of the fateful

19:51.440 --> 19:54.720
champagne glass.

19:55.480 --> 19:58.640
Who, whilst travelling with said glass,

19:55.480 --> 19:58.640
bumped into

19:59.320 --> 20:01.120
Lucy Preville, the First Secretary.

20:01.680 --> 20:04.960
Her first posting. Domestic staff

20:01.680 --> 20:04.960
confirm she's a workaholic.

20:05.120 --> 20:06.640
Apparently, she was even more uptight

20:06.760 --> 20:08.160
when she arrived in Saint-Marie.

20:08.640 --> 20:10.240
Ah. Then there is, er, President Tromeur,

20:10.280 --> 20:12.680
president of the General Council

20:10.280 --> 20:12.680
of Saint-Robert.

20:12.800 --> 20:15.320
Francois Tromeur has promised

20:12.800 --> 20:15.320
the people of Saint-Robert

20:15.360 --> 20:17.520
he'll give them <i>la Roche de la Republique.</i>

20:17.760 --> 20:18.800
FLORENCE: Caroline was threatening

20:18.920 --> 20:20.080
to cut trade with Saint-Robert,

20:20.400 --> 20:22.520
if he did not withdraw French claims.

20:22.680 --> 20:24.960
Damaging, yes. A murder motive, not sure.

20:25.000 --> 20:27.760
Next to Caroline, we have the Deputy Governor,

20:25.000 --> 20:27.760
Andy Hammond.

20:28.040 --> 20:29.680
His fourth posting in the Caribbean.

20:29.920 --> 20:31.800
Well, the view from the kitchen

20:29.920 --> 20:31.800
is that Andy Hammond

20:31.840 --> 20:33.280
was the real expert on the region.

20:33.720 --> 20:35.880
He was also extremely loyal to Caroline.

20:35.920 --> 20:39.120
And finally, there's Caroline's

20:35.920 --> 20:39.120
private secretary,

20:39.760 --> 20:41.360
Ellery Wallace.

20:41.440 --> 20:44.480
Divorced, one child, one minor offence

20:41.440 --> 20:44.480
dating back three years,

20:44.760 --> 20:45.800
reckless driving.

20:46.000 --> 20:48.080
-I'll find out.

20:51.080 --> 20:53.200
Er, Florence, er, what are you doing?

20:53.880 --> 20:56.840
The Commissioner had the best chance

20:53.880 --> 20:56.840
to poison Caroline's glass.

20:56.880 --> 21:00.600
I don't think he did. but logically,

20:56.880 --> 21:00.600
he needs to be up there.

21:01.600 --> 21:02.840
She has a point, you know, Chief.

21:05.120 --> 21:07.120
Here's how Spinner's Rock crisis started.

21:08.400 --> 21:10.000
Six months ago, a French tricolour

21:10.120 --> 21:11.800
suddenly appeared on Spinner's Rock.

21:12.160 --> 21:14.560
Now, Governor Bamber sent Andy Hammond

21:12.160 --> 21:14.560
to remove it.

21:15.440 --> 21:19.040
Soon afterwards, President Tromeur

21:15.440 --> 21:19.040
announced the rock was French.

21:20.000 --> 21:21.280
HUMPHREY: Have they got assault rifles?

21:22.120 --> 21:24.000
Maybe she thought the French were going to invade.

21:24.080 --> 21:26.640
Or maybe there's something on that rock

21:24.080 --> 21:26.640
she really didn't want found.

21:26.680 --> 21:29.120
Either way, handbags at 12

21:26.680 --> 21:29.120
paces this is not.

21:29.160 --> 21:32.280
Dwayne, J.P., I want you to visit

21:29.160 --> 21:32.280
this Spinner's Rock.

21:32.440 --> 21:35.480
Forget history. Something is going

21:32.440 --> 21:35.480
on there right now.

21:35.520 --> 21:37.560
-Yes, Chief. -Thank you.

21:40.200 --> 21:42.360
A text exchange on Caroline's phone

21:40.200 --> 21:42.360
from a month ago.

21:43.360 --> 21:44.360
Hmm.

21:44.640 --> 21:46.000
Caroline to Lucy Preville,

21:46.080 --> 21:47.560
"The French are reading our minds

21:46.080 --> 21:47.560
on SR. How?

21:47.600 --> 21:49.840
"Has someone been spiking your drinks?"

21:49.880 --> 21:51.120
Lucy to Caroline, "How dare you?"

21:51.760 --> 21:53.760
-SR must be Spinner's Rock. -Yes.

21:54.240 --> 21:56.000
"The French are reading our minds. How?"

21:56.040 --> 21:58.160
Caroline must be accusing Lucy of being indiscreet.

21:58.640 --> 22:01.120
And look. Caroline then texts Lucy,

22:01.520 --> 22:03.360
"Time for you to make a decision."

22:03.480 --> 22:05.120
Decision? Interesting.

22:05.800 --> 22:08.680
I think maybe we should go and see

22:05.800 --> 22:08.680
what it was.

22:13.360 --> 22:15.000
GUARD:  <i>Switch off your motor.</i>

22:15.120 --> 22:16.840
<i>This is a prohibited zone.</i>

22:31.600 --> 22:34.560
Look, I wasn't expecting a red carpet or

22:31.600 --> 22:34.560
a marching band

22:34.600 --> 22:36.080
or anything like that, you know.

22:36.240 --> 22:37.720
But they weren't exactly pleased to see us, were they?

22:38.080 --> 22:40.040
-I think the Inspector was right.

22:38.080 --> 22:40.040
-Hmm.

22:40.080 --> 22:42.240
And they are worried about us finding something.

22:42.280 --> 22:43.520
You better believe it.

22:44.040 --> 22:47.880
And I reckon we'll find out exactly what it

22:44.040 --> 22:47.880
is from up there.

22:47.920 --> 22:50.480
Or we could start from here

22:50.520 --> 22:52.760
and work our way up slowly if we don't find it.

22:53.760 --> 22:55.120
Start from up there, I reckon.

22:55.640 --> 22:56.760
J.P...

23:01.880 --> 23:04.160
Ah! J.P.!

23:06.560 --> 23:08.760
Why did Caroline think someone had been indiscreet

23:08.800 --> 23:10.800
about Spinner's Rock?

23:12.200 --> 23:14.600
President Tromeur was winning the PR war.

23:14.640 --> 23:16.960
Caroline was convinced someone had

23:14.640 --> 23:16.960
got hold of one of the various

23:17.720 --> 23:19.560
strategy papers she'd drawn up.

23:20.200 --> 23:21.600
So why was she blaming you?

23:22.960 --> 23:24.280
She blamed all of us at some point.

23:24.440 --> 23:26.600
Who did she think had been spiking your drinks?

23:27.720 --> 23:29.320
I have no idea.

23:32.720 --> 23:34.760
You smoke Cigane?

23:35.120 --> 23:36.240
Yes.

23:37.040 --> 23:38.040
You know, it's funny.

23:38.800 --> 23:41.480
President Tromeur smokes this brand, doesn't he?

23:42.160 --> 23:43.160
Does he?

23:43.880 --> 23:46.240
Well, Ms Preville, what's going on?

23:47.560 --> 23:50.120
Look, this has absolutely nothing to do

23:47.560 --> 23:50.120
with your investigation.

23:50.160 --> 23:52.560
If I'm honest, I think we should

23:50.160 --> 23:52.560
probably decide that.

24:04.000 --> 24:05.440
I lost my mother a year ago,

24:06.400 --> 24:08.520
to illness. Francois was...

24:10.160 --> 24:13.480
understanding. He'd lost his mother

24:10.160 --> 24:13.480
about the same age.

24:13.520 --> 24:15.840
He was generous

24:15.880 --> 24:17.200
and vulnerable.

24:17.240 --> 24:19.440
Oh, it took me by surprise, that side of him.

24:20.040 --> 24:22.600
I began to see the whole arrogance thing was,

24:23.640 --> 24:26.600
well, is sort of a shield.

24:28.760 --> 24:30.720
And that's how it began.

24:31.520 --> 24:33.640
Are you in love with him?

24:33.680 --> 24:35.240
I don't have to answer that.

24:35.280 --> 24:36.720
Who knew about your relationship?

24:36.840 --> 24:38.240
Only Caroline.

24:38.720 --> 24:40.000
It wasn't anyone else's business.

24:40.120 --> 24:41.560
I briefed her about a year ago.

24:41.960 --> 24:43.680
And she was okay with it?

24:45.040 --> 24:48.120
It's not against Foreign Office rules

24:45.040 --> 24:48.120
to have a French boyfriend.

24:48.160 --> 24:49.480
HUMPHREY: But then Spinner's Rock happened.

24:50.080 --> 24:53.720
Suddenly, Caroline saw your boyfriend

24:50.080 --> 24:53.720
as the enemy.

24:53.760 --> 24:55.560
Was that the decision she told you to make?

24:56.240 --> 24:58.280
Francois or the Foreign Office?

24:58.320 --> 25:00.640
If my boss had forced me to make that decision...

25:00.680 --> 25:01.640
Nothing happened.

25:02.200 --> 25:05.000
I told her I never discuss work

25:02.200 --> 25:05.000
with Francois.

25:05.040 --> 25:07.480
I said we tended to have other things on our mind.

25:08.040 --> 25:10.080
-LUCY: Of course.

25:13.920 --> 25:16.720
Look, I have a great instinct in these things

25:16.760 --> 25:20.360
and that instinct is telling me that

25:16.760 --> 25:20.360
at the end of the day,

25:20.920 --> 25:22.280
it's nothing but a rock!

25:22.400 --> 25:25.240
But the Inspector's sure something is going on here.

25:26.080 --> 25:27.600
Well, I'm going to have a little sit-down.

25:28.120 --> 25:30.240
You probably want one, too, huh?

25:30.280 --> 25:34.960
Hmm, or maybe it's not about what is on this rock

25:35.600 --> 25:37.200
but where it is.

25:37.800 --> 25:40.360
Maybe this rock is some sort of symbol.

25:43.440 --> 25:46.520
That's all very fascinating but you might want

25:43.440 --> 25:46.520
to look over there.

25:50.160 --> 25:52.560
What is that?

25:54.600 --> 25:56.240
Caroline knew about your affair.

25:57.200 --> 25:58.680
She never mentioned it.

25:58.720 --> 26:00.520
I think she was threatening to tell your wife about it.

26:00.560 --> 26:03.800
That was the real ultimatum she gave you

26:00.560 --> 26:03.800
over Spinner's Rock.

26:07.080 --> 26:09.040
That would have been no threat at all.

26:09.760 --> 26:11.840
I guess that Sandrine is used to you straying,

26:12.880 --> 26:15.120
affairs being part and parcel of a French marriage.

26:15.320 --> 26:16.880
She probably wouldn't have

26:15.320 --> 26:16.880
batted an eyelid.

26:17.280 --> 26:18.520
Remind me, Sergeant Cassell,

26:19.120 --> 26:22.200
do the French say <i>une affaire</i>  or <i> une liaison?</i>

26:22.440 --> 26:23.600
<i>Une liaison.</i>

26:24.080 --> 26:25.160
Thanks.

26:33.400 --> 26:35.880
I was with Lucy because I was scared.

26:36.280 --> 26:37.840
Scared of what?

26:38.360 --> 26:40.040
Getting old.

26:43.360 --> 26:46.760
And the moment Caroline threatened to

26:43.360 --> 26:46.760
tell Sandrine, I...

26:48.760 --> 26:50.480
suddenly felt this terror.

26:52.640 --> 26:56.640
At the thought of losing Sandrine,

26:52.640 --> 26:56.640
of not having her in my life.

26:58.760 --> 27:02.000
I finally understood what I had been risking.

27:02.040 --> 27:03.560
For what?

27:03.600 --> 27:05.600
Which is why you had to silence Caroline.

27:06.000 --> 27:08.200
No, she was bluffing.

27:08.520 --> 27:10.760
She would never have told Sandrine.

27:12.880 --> 27:15.080
Caroline brought me to my senses.

27:16.760 --> 27:19.120
I decided to end it with Lucy.

27:19.920 --> 27:22.840
I was going to do it at the party,

27:19.920 --> 27:22.840
but then...

27:24.080 --> 27:27.440
Please, don't tell my wife about Lucy.

27:32.080 --> 27:34.360
HUMPHREY: He's been selfish. She's been deluded.

27:34.760 --> 27:36.360
They make quite the pair.

27:36.400 --> 27:38.880
Was Francois Tromeur really going to

27:36.400 --> 27:38.880
risk losing his wife

27:38.920 --> 27:40.280
by calling Caroline's bluff? And even if he did,

27:40.360 --> 27:41.720
we've still got the problem

27:41.760 --> 27:43.040
of who wrote Caroline the letter

27:43.160 --> 27:44.440
warning her her life was in danger,

27:44.800 --> 27:46.800
and why

27:47.240 --> 27:49.560
Well, Chief, either this

27:47.240 --> 27:49.560
Spinner's Rock thing

27:49.600 --> 27:50.960
really is all about history,

27:51.400 --> 27:52.920
or it's got something to do with these.

27:54.400 --> 27:55.440
HUMPHREY: Drill holes?

27:55.800 --> 27:57.840
Into what looks like some kind of volcanic rock.

27:58.160 --> 27:59.800
-Er...

28:02.960 --> 28:05.720
This rock is the same as that rock.

28:06.680 --> 28:08.840
-Erm, Dwayne, go get these to the lab.

28:08.880 --> 28:10.960
-Yes, Chief. -And then that'll

28:08.880 --> 28:10.960
be all for today,

28:11.000 --> 28:12.280
it's getting late.

28:19.360 --> 28:20.840
I've got a 94% match.

28:22.160 --> 28:23.760
You're joking.

28:23.920 --> 28:26.680
A girl has answered 94% of the questions

28:23.920 --> 28:26.680
exactly the same as me.

28:34.440 --> 28:35.400
It's a miracle.

28:35.840 --> 28:37.080
I think this might be destiny.

28:38.720 --> 28:40.280
-She's gorgeous. -HUMPHREY: Yes.

28:40.880 --> 28:41.920
CATHERINE: So what's her name?

28:42.320 --> 28:44.720
Er, well, she left that blank,

28:42.320 --> 28:44.720
unfortunately.

28:45.320 --> 28:48.080
Yeah, and further added to her mystique

28:48.520 --> 28:51.440
by putting "Somewhere in the Caribbean"

28:48.520 --> 28:51.440
for her location.

28:52.000 --> 28:53.680
So when are you going to send your message?

28:54.000 --> 28:56.640
Well, I was rather hoping that, er,

28:54.000 --> 28:56.640
Dwayne would tell me that. Don't worry, Chief,

28:57.280 --> 28:59.920
I know exactly what you should say.

29:00.200 --> 29:02.560
-Yes, erm, hit me with it.

29:02.840 --> 29:06.200
Right. So based on my deep knowledge of women,

29:06.720 --> 29:08.760
you know, how they work and, er,

29:08.880 --> 29:10.760
what makes them tick and, you know,

29:10.800 --> 29:14.360
so on, and what with you answering all

29:10.800 --> 29:14.360
the questions the same

29:14.400 --> 29:16.680
and everything like that, this is what you should write.

29:18.240 --> 29:19.360
"Let's meet."

29:20.480 --> 29:21.920
-Mmm-hmm.

29:22.320 --> 29:23.520
Isn't that a bit rude?

29:23.640 --> 29:24.800
DWAYNE: Rude? Chief,

29:25.400 --> 29:26.840
the fish is already on the hook.

29:27.120 --> 29:28.440
All you have to do is reel it in.

29:28.960 --> 29:30.680
Right.

29:35.440 --> 29:36.560
Good evening.

29:46.080 --> 29:47.440
You sure you don't want a lift, sir?

29:47.800 --> 29:49.280
I'm fine, Florence, honestly. I...

29:49.400 --> 29:51.680
I just fancy walking home tonight.

29:51.720 --> 29:52.760
Okay, see you tomorrow.

29:52.880 --> 29:54.080
Goodnight.

30:17.920 --> 30:19.840
-Morning. -Er, morning, Chief.

30:20.160 --> 30:21.800
So did you send your reply? Er, yes, Dwayne. In the end,

30:23.600 --> 30:25.520
I decided to go with my own version,

30:23.600 --> 30:25.520
I hope you don't mind.

30:25.800 --> 30:26.960
Not at all. I went around the houses a bit

30:28.280 --> 30:29.320
on a couple of things.

30:29.520 --> 30:31.360
I finally sent it off about 4:00 a.m.

30:31.400 --> 30:33.320
-Yes.

30:34.560 --> 30:36.280
Can we hear it, sir?

30:36.400 --> 30:38.280
Okay.

30:40.280 --> 30:42.400
"Dear Miss. "I was delighted

30:43.440 --> 30:45.560
to be notified of our match.

30:46.080 --> 30:48.240
"Here's hoping we can meet face-to-face soon.

30:48.600 --> 30:49.880
"Best, Humphrey."

30:51.280 --> 30:54.080
I spent a long time debating whether to put a kiss.

30:54.400 --> 30:55.960
Ended up leaving it.

30:56.360 --> 30:57.320
It's great, sir.

30:57.440 --> 30:58.560
She'll definitely reply to that.

30:58.760 --> 30:59.880
Good.

31:01.760 --> 31:02.960
4:00 a.m. for that?

31:03.480 --> 31:05.680
So President Tromeur,

31:05.960 --> 31:09.280
Andy Hammond and Lucy Preville were the

31:05.960 --> 31:09.280
only people anywhere near

31:09.320 --> 31:10.600
Caroline Bamber's champagne glass

31:10.720 --> 31:12.080
when we think the cyanide was added.

31:12.360 --> 31:14.520
Apart from, of course, the Commissioner, Florence.

31:15.280 --> 31:16.760
Now, we've learned

31:16.800 --> 31:18.920
that Francois and Lucy were having an affair

31:18.960 --> 31:21.760
and Caroline was using this to blackmail Francois.

31:21.800 --> 31:24.400
She may also have been

31:21.800 --> 31:24.400
pressing Lucy Preville

31:24.440 --> 31:26.080
to end the relationship on security grounds.

31:26.120 --> 31:29.120
However, neither motive can explain

31:26.120 --> 31:29.120
how the cyanide jumped

31:29.160 --> 31:31.080
from either of them into Caroline's glass

31:31.120 --> 31:32.800
without the Commissioner noticing.

31:33.000 --> 31:36.040
Sir, I looked into Ellery's reckless driving.

31:36.080 --> 31:39.200
He collided head-on with a car being driven by

31:36.080 --> 31:39.200
one of the directors

31:39.240 --> 31:40.200
of a construction firm.

31:40.400 --> 31:42.160
-J.P.: No, luckily.

31:42.440 --> 31:44.560
But listen to this. A week earlier,

31:44.600 --> 31:48.560
Ellery was found trespassing in the Club Caribbean

31:44.600 --> 31:48.560
holiday camp.

31:48.600 --> 31:50.160
-Club Caribbean. -Which was being built

31:50.200 --> 31:51.840
by the same director's company,

31:52.280 --> 31:53.680
Parrington Construction, at the time.

31:53.880 --> 31:56.000
I think a friend of my brother's worked

31:56.120 --> 31:58.240
on the Club Caribbean

31:56.120 --> 31:58.240
building project.

31:58.280 --> 32:00.080
-I could speak to him. -Hmm.

32:01.400 --> 32:02.600
Ah, the lab.

32:03.560 --> 32:06.120
Well, the rock sample

32:03.560 --> 32:06.120
you sent them

32:06.240 --> 32:08.840
is something called ultramafic.

32:09.400 --> 32:12.240
They are 98% confident it contains

32:12.680 --> 32:13.840
emerald reserves.

32:14.720 --> 32:16.400
Wow, emeralds.

32:16.880 --> 32:19.800
That useless rock is actually one big gemstone?

32:20.200 --> 32:22.960
So, Spinner's Rock isn't about history,

32:20.200 --> 32:22.960
it's about a lot of money,

32:23.000 --> 32:24.640
which begins to explain why Caroline Bamber

32:24.680 --> 32:26.560
might've been killed over it.

32:26.600 --> 32:28.680
Dwayne, J.P., get a warrant to search the whole

32:26.600 --> 32:28.680
of Government House.

32:29.280 --> 32:31.880
We need to find out exactly what our suspects knew

32:31.920 --> 32:34.320
about the true value of Spinner's Rock.

32:34.520 --> 32:35.840
Yes, Chief.

32:35.880 --> 32:38.640
And I think I know just who to start with.

32:42.320 --> 32:44.120
HUMPHREY: Can we have a word,

32:42.320 --> 32:44.120
Mr Hammond,

32:44.640 --> 32:46.640
in private?

32:46.760 --> 32:48.960
Of course. Erm, thank you.

32:52.240 --> 32:56.000
The emeralds on Spinner's Rock.

32:52.240 --> 32:56.000
Slip your mind, did they?

32:56.040 --> 32:58.080
I've got no idea what you're talking about.

32:58.720 --> 33:01.360
So you don't know the rock is made

32:58.720 --> 33:01.360
up of gemstone?

33:03.840 --> 33:05.800
"They want to kill you before you go

33:03.840 --> 33:05.800
because of June 10th."

33:07.000 --> 33:08.120
We asked you if you knew what that meant,

33:08.160 --> 33:10.040
you said you had no idea, you lied.

33:11.040 --> 33:13.080
So what else have you lied about,

33:11.040 --> 33:13.080
Mr Hammond?

33:15.840 --> 33:20.040
All right. What I'm about to tell you

33:15.840 --> 33:20.040
and show you

33:20.280 --> 33:23.440
absolutely cannot be shared outside your investigation.

33:23.880 --> 33:25.800
You have our word.

33:31.040 --> 33:34.880
Just over six months ago, a British geologist

33:31.040 --> 33:34.880
on a sailing holiday

33:34.920 --> 33:36.960
happened to moor off Spinner's Rock.

33:37.600 --> 33:41.000
He spotted that the rock might be emerald-bearing.

33:41.040 --> 33:44.840
Fortunately, he was kind enough

33:41.040 --> 33:44.840
to tell Caroline about it,

33:44.880 --> 33:47.960
so she commissioned some discreet drilling.

33:50.120 --> 33:51.480
How much of this is there?

33:51.520 --> 33:53.040
We don't know exactly, but we're estimating

33:53.080 --> 33:55.200
tens of millions of pounds' worth.

33:56.000 --> 33:57.600
Soon afterwards, our geologists spotted

33:57.720 --> 33:59.280
drill holes that weren't theirs.

33:59.520 --> 34:00.480
Then one day,

34:01.040 --> 34:02.880
the tricolour flag appeared on the rock.

34:03.320 --> 34:04.880
Someone told the French about the emeralds.

34:05.000 --> 34:08.520
Yeah, and now those canny frogs

34:05.000 --> 34:08.520
are rewriting history

34:08.560 --> 34:10.880
to try to claim Spinner's Rock for themselves.

34:11.800 --> 34:12.800
Ah, no offence.

34:13.880 --> 34:16.440
So who did tell the French about the emeralds?

34:16.480 --> 34:18.160
We don't know.

34:18.640 --> 34:19.760
Who knew about them?

34:19.880 --> 34:21.160
Well, er,

34:22.920 --> 34:27.040
apart from the geologists, Caroline, myself

34:22.920 --> 34:27.040
and Lucy Preville.

34:27.080 --> 34:28.200
Ellery Wallace?

34:28.320 --> 34:29.640
Caroline shared everything with him.

34:30.360 --> 34:31.680
But...

34:31.880 --> 34:34.480
I did wonder whether the leak wasn't Caroline herself.

34:35.360 --> 34:37.760
Well, she was superb at the big picture

34:37.800 --> 34:40.120
but sometimes she could be

34:37.800 --> 34:40.120
a little careless.

34:40.160 --> 34:41.480
Known to leave the odd memo

34:43.040 --> 34:44.960
It would only have taken one dishonest cleaner.

34:45.520 --> 34:47.080
It's my brother's friend.

34:53.200 --> 34:54.760
We're in Ellery Wallace's office,

34:54.880 --> 34:56.600
there's something you should see.

34:57.560 --> 34:58.680
Thank you.

35:03.240 --> 35:04.280
What is it?

35:04.440 --> 35:05.720
It was hidden in the back of the drawer.

35:07.040 --> 35:08.520
HUMPHREY: <i> Lockdown</i> <i>Private Security hired</i>

35:08.560 --> 35:10.160
<i>for the ongoing security</i> <i>of Spinner's Rock.</i>

35:10.560 --> 35:11.840


35:11.920 --> 35:13.560
From yesterday, in Caroline's office.

35:16.200 --> 35:17.160
Not just hers.

35:17.400 --> 35:18.840
This thing allows you to listen in

35:18.960 --> 35:21.080
on any room in Government House.

35:21.120 --> 35:22.280
HUMPHREY: Ah, Florence.

35:22.560 --> 35:25.160
So, my brother's friend had heard of Ellery Wallace.

35:25.360 --> 35:27.760
It turns out the Club Caribbean

35:25.360 --> 35:27.760
building site

35:27.800 --> 35:29.680
went straight through Ellery's village.

35:30.240 --> 35:32.480
Three years ago, soon after construction began,

35:32.680 --> 35:34.760
a young girl crossing the road in the village

35:34.800 --> 35:37.440
was killed by a Parrington

35:34.800 --> 35:37.440
Construction truck. It was Ellery's daughter.

35:38.240 --> 35:40.880
She was seven years old.

35:41.320 --> 35:44.200
Apparently, Ellery's village had begged

35:41.320 --> 35:44.200
the construction company

35:44.240 --> 35:45.840
to use a different route for its trucks.

35:46.360 --> 35:48.480
But they had insisted there was no alternative.

35:48.760 --> 35:50.400
Gosh, that's awful.

35:50.440 --> 35:52.480
So now we know why Ellery crashed

35:50.440 --> 35:52.480
into that director's car.

35:52.520 --> 35:53.480
He wanted revenge.

35:53.920 --> 35:55.240
FLORENCE: And there's something else.

35:55.680 --> 35:57.840
The person who awarded the building contract

35:57.880 --> 36:00.000
to the construction company in the first place?

36:00.840 --> 36:01.920
Caroline Bamber.

36:02.800 --> 36:04.160
What?

36:04.320 --> 36:06.880
Which begs the question, did Ellery Wallace know this?

36:06.960 --> 36:09.800
Well, I think he's got a lot of explaining to do.

36:14.560 --> 36:17.120
My old village had warned

36:14.560 --> 36:17.120
Parrington Construction

36:17.160 --> 36:19.640
that driving trucks past the school

36:17.160 --> 36:19.640
was dangerous.

36:20.560 --> 36:22.960
Telephone calls, letters, petitions.

36:23.880 --> 36:25.520
Amber had her whole life ahead of her.

36:25.880 --> 36:28.600
Was that the real reason you got a job

36:25.880 --> 36:28.600
at Government House?

36:29.040 --> 36:30.120
Yes.

36:31.120 --> 36:32.840
Because you blame Caroline for her death?

36:36.240 --> 36:38.440
She was the one that gave the construction

36:36.240 --> 36:38.440
company the contract.

36:38.640 --> 36:40.200
Yes, but she wasn't the one insisting

36:40.240 --> 36:42.320
on driving trucks down that road, was she?

36:43.440 --> 36:45.920
I went to Government House 'cause I couldn't

36:43.440 --> 36:45.920
bear the idea

36:45.960 --> 36:47.760
of one more child being killed on that road.

36:48.720 --> 36:50.520
How were you going to stop that happening?

36:51.600 --> 36:53.920
I had heard Governor Bamber being interviewed.

36:54.480 --> 36:57.120
She seemed like an understanding person.

36:58.160 --> 37:00.920
I felt sure that if I could just

36:58.160 --> 37:00.920
tell her about Amber,

37:00.960 --> 37:02.760
she would do something.

37:03.800 --> 37:06.960
So I got a job as a security guard

37:03.800 --> 37:06.960
in Government House.

37:07.840 --> 37:12.960
And then, once I felt like Caroline knew who I was,

37:13.000 --> 37:14.520
I told her Amber's story.

37:17.080 --> 37:18.640
<i>She was horrified</i>

37:18.680 --> 37:21.600
<i>and furious that no one</i> <i>had told her about it before.</i>

37:23.400 --> 37:24.680
And did she act?

37:25.000 --> 37:26.960
I need to show you something.

37:41.240 --> 37:43.800
This is where Amber was killed.

37:47.840 --> 37:49.560
Listen.

37:53.720 --> 37:55.480
No traffic.

37:55.520 --> 37:57.720
Caroline built a new road.

37:58.840 --> 38:02.160
It opened about eight months after I told her about Amber.

38:03.560 --> 38:05.400
It bypasses the village, so now,

38:05.560 --> 38:07.400
all the tourist coaches and service trucks

38:07.440 --> 38:08.760
from Club Caribbean use that.

38:10.280 --> 38:11.680
Caroline was a true friend.

38:12.440 --> 38:15.280
When did Caroline promote you to her private secretary?

38:15.480 --> 38:16.600
A few months later.

38:16.920 --> 38:19.560
It was because of all this that she got to know me.

38:20.360 --> 38:23.640
So Caroline helped protect your village,

38:20.360 --> 38:23.640
she gave you a career hike.

38:24.520 --> 38:26.120
So how come you ended up bugging her office

38:26.160 --> 38:27.480
and the rest of Government House?

38:27.840 --> 38:28.960
Because she asked me to.

38:29.600 --> 38:30.640
What?

38:30.760 --> 38:32.480
Caroline was convinced

38:32.520 --> 38:35.200
that someone on her staff was leaking information

38:32.520 --> 38:35.200
to the French.

38:35.400 --> 38:36.560
About the emeralds?

38:37.360 --> 38:38.880
Andy Hammond told us.

38:40.440 --> 38:42.280
Yes, about the emeralds.

38:42.960 --> 38:44.200
She asked me to fit microphones

38:44.320 --> 38:45.720
to all the key rooms and listen in.

38:46.520 --> 38:49.200
What did you discover from your, er, listening in?

38:50.080 --> 38:51.040
Nothing.

38:51.880 --> 38:54.000
I still have no idea who the leak was.

38:54.560 --> 38:56.680
Can you prove that Caroline ordered you to do this?

38:56.880 --> 39:00.040
No, but don't you think if I was spying on her,

39:00.080 --> 39:03.160
I would have removed all the kit

39:00.080 --> 39:03.160
from my office by now?

39:09.760 --> 39:11.120
Wow, wha... Sir?

39:11.800 --> 39:12.800
You have to listen to this.

39:13.320 --> 39:15.280
It's from Caroline's office just before the party.

39:15.640 --> 39:18.200
Ellery's just tying up loose ends

39:15.640 --> 39:18.200
with Caroline.

39:18.560 --> 39:19.680
ELLERY: <i>One last thing before you go</i>

39:19.800 --> 39:21.280
<i>to the party tonight,</i> <i>Governor.</i>

39:21.720 --> 39:24.120
<i>That donation</i> <i>you wanted to give</i>

39:21.720 --> 39:24.120
<i>to the orphanage chairman,</i>

39:24.160 --> 39:25.960
<i>it's there on the desk</i> <i>for you to check.</i>

39:26.000 --> 39:27.400
CAROLINE: <i>Oh, I'm sure it'll be fine.</i>

39:27.440 --> 39:28.760
Okay, now, listen to this.

39:28.800 --> 39:29.960
CAROLINE: <i> Yes, Lucy.</i>

39:30.400 --> 39:31.680
I need a word,

39:32.320 --> 39:33.480
in private.

39:33.880 --> 39:36.600
I'll be back in a minute to take you two

39:33.880 --> 39:36.600
for your speech.

39:37.440 --> 39:38.560
CAROLINE: What is it?

39:39.560 --> 39:40.440
Don't send that report.

39:41.040 --> 39:42.400
I told you, if you end it with Francois

39:42.520 --> 39:43.960
before I get on the plane, I'll drop it.

39:44.480 --> 39:45.720
You know I can't do that.

39:45.760 --> 39:47.320
It's your choice. Then you leave me no choice.

39:52.800 --> 39:55.200
Caroline wasn't the only one giving out an ultimatum.

39:55.480 --> 39:57.560
So how was Lucy about to punish her?

40:00.080 --> 40:02.640
So, have you heard back from the girl off

40:00.080 --> 40:02.640
the dating site?

40:02.720 --> 40:05.480
No, Miss 94% is resisting me so far.

40:05.880 --> 40:06.840
It's early days.

40:06.920 --> 40:08.560
Yes, but I am starting to wonder

40:08.600 --> 40:11.400
if adding a kiss at the end might've been the way to go.

40:22.600 --> 40:23.920
No. Look.

40:27.120 --> 40:28.120
He was here last night.

40:28.560 --> 40:29.800
What is he up to?

40:34.640 --> 40:35.960
Let's follow him.

40:36.080 --> 40:37.640
I'll get Dwayne and J.P. to join us.

41:04.480 --> 41:05.760
He's not walking naturally.

41:05.880 --> 41:07.360
No, he's nervous.

41:27.000 --> 41:29.080
-Wasn't that... -Yes.

41:44.520 --> 41:46.400
Need a hand with that bag, Mr Hammond?

42:03.240 --> 42:04.480
J.P.: He's gone, sir.

42:10.080 --> 42:13.160
You appear to be following me,

42:10.080 --> 42:13.160
Inspector.

42:16.080 --> 42:18.280
I'd like to see inside that bag.

42:18.760 --> 42:19.880
Sorry.

42:22.840 --> 42:25.000
I trust you know enough diplomatic etiquette

42:25.040 --> 42:26.080
not to insist.

42:27.240 --> 42:31.960
Article 29 of the Vienna Convention

42:27.240 --> 42:31.960
on Diplomatic Relations.

42:32.400 --> 42:34.440
Do you really want chapter and verse?

42:43.320 --> 42:45.040
-Had to.

42:45.640 --> 42:48.440
Can't stop and search a serving head

42:45.640 --> 42:48.440
of government, J.P.

42:49.880 --> 42:51.760
Caroline didn't leave out any memos

42:51.880 --> 42:53.960
and there was no dishonest cleaner.

42:54.680 --> 42:56.160
Spying for the French. Now, what on earth

42:57.360 --> 42:58.840
made you do that?

43:00.520 --> 43:01.480
Mr Hammond?

43:02.480 --> 43:05.720
A few months ago, I interviewed

43:02.480 --> 43:05.720
for Caroline's replacement.

43:05.760 --> 43:08.000
Everybody on that panel knew I deserved the job.

43:08.160 --> 43:09.280
Yet still they snubbed you.

43:09.680 --> 43:11.080
Gave it to some Oxbridge tosser

43:11.200 --> 43:12.640
who'd spent his career in Brussels.

43:13.200 --> 43:15.240
Because I'm not up to it? No.

43:15.640 --> 43:18.240
Because I went to a red-brick university

43:18.280 --> 43:20.080
and because I speak my mind.

43:20.120 --> 43:21.600
So you came up against a glass ceiling

43:21.640 --> 43:24.000
and when you bumped your head

43:21.640 --> 43:24.000
you wanted compensation.

43:24.120 --> 43:25.560
Well, I knew how much the information

43:25.600 --> 43:27.560
about the Spinner's Rock

43:25.600 --> 43:27.560
emeralds was worth.

43:27.880 --> 43:29.400
So you approached Francois,

43:30.120 --> 43:32.280
who probably couldn't believe his luck.

43:32.400 --> 43:34.560
How often have you been

43:32.400 --> 43:34.560
giving him information?

43:35.920 --> 43:37.560
Every couple of weeks.

43:37.680 --> 43:39.680
We'd arrange swaps for whenever Francois

43:39.800 --> 43:41.720
visited Government House for talks.

43:42.160 --> 43:43.840
I was due to give him the latest information

43:43.880 --> 43:45.320
at Caroline's leaving party.

43:46.080 --> 43:47.760
-In the gents. -But once she died,

43:47.800 --> 43:49.480
it was probably safer to use the streets

43:47.800 --> 43:49.480
than a crime scene,

43:49.840 --> 43:51.280
and that's what you were doing last night.

43:51.520 --> 43:54.120
We were due to swap yesterday but Francois didn't turn up.

43:55.000 --> 43:57.680
I think he was spooked after you visited

43:55.000 --> 43:57.680
him yesterday.

43:58.080 --> 43:59.720
So,

44:00.440 --> 44:03.400
you were betraying your bosses,

44:00.440 --> 44:03.400
your colleagues, your country.

44:04.520 --> 44:05.760
You lied to us at every stage.

44:06.680 --> 44:08.840
Well, I think there's one more thing

44:06.680 --> 44:08.840
you haven't quite told us.

44:09.640 --> 44:11.600
That Caroline had worked out that you were the leak.

44:11.640 --> 44:13.840
That she was going to speak to your security

44:11.640 --> 44:13.840
department in London

44:13.880 --> 44:15.280
on her return, so you killed her.

44:16.400 --> 44:18.480
No! I could never do that.

44:19.120 --> 44:21.280
Not to Caroline.

44:21.320 --> 44:22.960
Not to anyone.

44:24.120 --> 44:27.040
Please, it wasn't me.

44:31.280 --> 44:32.560
So he committed espionage

44:32.600 --> 44:35.320
but did he also kill Caroline? Or was it Lucy,

44:35.600 --> 44:38.200
backed into a corner about her feelings

44:35.600 --> 44:38.200
for Francois Tromeur?

44:38.560 --> 44:40.920
Well, whether it's Andy or Lucy,

44:40.960 --> 44:43.440
we still need to establish who wrote that letter.

44:43.560 --> 44:45.360
Hmm, yes. We keep coming

44:43.560 --> 44:45.360
back to this letter.

44:45.400 --> 44:49.240
Someone clearly wanted to save

44:45.400 --> 44:49.240
the Governor's life, but who?

44:50.960 --> 44:52.880
-Ah, sir.

44:52.960 --> 44:54.120
Commissioner.

44:55.960 --> 44:57.320
Ah, what a surprise, sir.

44:57.360 --> 44:59.840
Is there, er, anything we can help you with?

45:08.320 --> 45:10.200
Ah, mmm, ah...

45:11.720 --> 45:13.240
I hope you know, sir, that we would

45:13.320 --> 45:15.480
never, ever question your integrity.

45:16.040 --> 45:17.080
On the contrary,

45:17.840 --> 45:19.720
my inclusion as a murder suspect

45:20.240 --> 45:23.760
seems to indicate one or two serious

45:20.240 --> 45:23.760
doubts on your part

45:24.280 --> 45:25.840
over my version of events.

45:26.320 --> 45:28.200
No, sir. No, not at all.

45:28.360 --> 45:29.520
Detective Inspector,

45:29.960 --> 45:31.440
I cannot vouch for what was done

45:31.560 --> 45:33.120
to Governor Bamber's champagne glass

45:33.160 --> 45:36.440
before or after my involvement,

45:38.640 --> 45:42.040
but no one put poison in it

45:42.920 --> 45:46.480
while it was within my sight.

45:50.400 --> 45:52.360
Not even me.

45:53.120 --> 45:54.240
Ah!

45:55.640 --> 45:57.240
Gosh, you're right, sir.

45:58.600 --> 45:59.760
You can't, can you?

45:59.800 --> 46:01.240
Can't what?

46:03.360 --> 46:04.520
COMMISSIONER: <i>When she arrived,</i>

46:04.640 --> 46:05.880
<i>she went straight</i> <i>into her speech.</i>

46:05.920 --> 46:07.640
I thought she seemed a bit nervous.

46:07.760 --> 46:08.800
She wasn't nervous at all.

46:09.840 --> 46:11.840
That doesn't answer the question of the letter.

46:12.480 --> 46:14.600
FLORENCE: <i> Someone</i> <i>definitely wanted her dead.</i>

46:14.680 --> 46:16.600
Sir, you have to listen to this.

46:17.400 --> 46:19.840
Unless... But could be, could be!

46:20.240 --> 46:22.080
Where's that guest list?

46:24.920 --> 46:26.360
They weren't there.

46:26.400 --> 46:28.720
You see? They weren't at the party.

46:31.440 --> 46:34.080
That is very clever. That is very clever, indeed.

46:31.440 --> 46:34.080
Dwayne!

46:35.920 --> 46:37.800
We have to get this warning letter

46:35.920 --> 46:37.800
over to the labs.

46:37.840 --> 46:39.000
Immediately, Chief.

46:40.680 --> 46:43.200
Caroline had a serious clear-out.

46:43.240 --> 46:45.040
I wonder? I wonder.

46:47.160 --> 46:48.680
Right.

46:59.720 --> 47:00.840
This is it.

47:02.040 --> 47:03.760
This is it!

47:04.320 --> 47:06.360
The whole thing makes sense now.

47:06.400 --> 47:07.560
Excellent.

47:14.320 --> 47:15.320
HUMPHREY: Er...

47:16.000 --> 47:18.320
Thank you all for joining me.

47:18.360 --> 47:21.240
I'm a busy man, so if you could be

47:18.360 --> 47:21.240
as brief as possible.

47:21.680 --> 47:24.040
HUMPHREY: Not really my long suit,

47:21.680 --> 47:24.040
being brief.

47:24.080 --> 47:25.440
But then, seeing as I'm about to tell you

47:25.480 --> 47:28.160
who killed Caroline Bamber...

47:28.680 --> 47:31.480
You see, one of the things that puzzled me

47:28.680 --> 47:31.480
most about this case

47:31.520 --> 47:34.920
is just how was Caroline murdered?

47:36.280 --> 47:38.680
We know that she died after drinking

47:36.280 --> 47:38.680
a glass of champagne

47:38.720 --> 47:40.560
laced with a fatal dose of cyanide.

47:41.520 --> 47:42.840
But we also know that the bottle

47:42.960 --> 47:44.400
that was used to pour out her glass

47:44.440 --> 47:45.640
contained no poison.

47:45.960 --> 47:46.960
In other words,

47:47.720 --> 47:51.160
the cyanide must have been added

47:47.720 --> 47:51.160
directly to her glass.

47:51.320 --> 47:52.440
But how?

47:53.600 --> 47:55.000
Well, thanks to the Commissioner here,

47:55.480 --> 47:59.080
we were able to identify three people who

47:55.480 --> 47:59.080
might have been able

47:59.120 --> 48:00.960
to slip cyanide into the glass.

48:01.800 --> 48:05.000
That is assuming we discount the Commissioner himself here.

48:05.120 --> 48:06.880
-Which we do. -Indeed.

48:07.640 --> 48:08.560
But in the end,

48:09.040 --> 48:12.080
that is how the cyanide got into Caroline's glass.

48:12.520 --> 48:15.640
It was added after the Commissioner

48:12.520 --> 48:15.640
picked it up.

48:16.520 --> 48:19.760
So who did poison Caroline's glass?

48:20.440 --> 48:21.760
Well, before we answer that,

48:21.800 --> 48:23.920
there is another question we need to consider.

48:24.120 --> 48:27.480
Just who was it who sent the anonymous

48:24.120 --> 48:27.480
letter to Caroline

48:27.560 --> 48:29.520
warning her that her life was in danger?

48:30.280 --> 48:33.520
It could only be someone 100% loyal to her.

48:34.040 --> 48:35.520
Someone like you, Ellery.

48:37.520 --> 48:40.000
It was you who sent the letter,

48:37.520 --> 48:40.000
wasn't it?

48:42.520 --> 48:44.760
You knew somebody was trying to kill Caroline?

48:45.240 --> 48:47.240
He did. Ellery was often more aware

48:47.280 --> 48:50.120
of what was going on in Government

48:47.280 --> 48:50.120
House than anyone.

48:50.160 --> 48:52.320
And Caroline's murder was no exception.

48:54.800 --> 48:57.160
Which brings us to you three.

48:58.400 --> 49:02.400
You all had motives to want Caroline dead.

49:02.440 --> 49:05.080
Mr Hammond, you felt so snubbed at work

49:05.120 --> 49:06.800
you were prepared to betray your own country.

49:07.920 --> 49:10.520
HUMPHREY: While I think that Caroline

49:07.920 --> 49:10.520
probably had her suspicions

49:10.560 --> 49:12.800
about your betrayal,

49:12.840 --> 49:14.000
you didn't kill her.

49:17.240 --> 49:19.880
So was it President Tromeur?

49:20.600 --> 49:22.680
We now know Caroline was blackmailing you.

49:23.440 --> 49:25.200
But you didn't kill her, either.

49:27.080 --> 49:29.240
So now we're all rather looking at you, Lucy.

49:30.680 --> 49:31.760
After all,

49:31.800 --> 49:33.200
you knew that if Caroline had made

49:33.320 --> 49:34.560
your affair with Francois known,

49:35.080 --> 49:38.440
your career at the Foreign Office

49:35.080 --> 49:38.440
would be over.

49:38.480 --> 49:40.840
That's why I tried to leave the party

49:38.480 --> 49:40.840
that night.

49:41.360 --> 49:43.360
I was going to write my resignation letter,

49:43.400 --> 49:45.600
so I could be with Francois.

49:45.640 --> 49:47.480
HUMPHREY: Don't worry.

49:47.520 --> 49:49.240
I know you're also innocent.

49:49.280 --> 49:52.120
But I would hold off writing that

49:49.280 --> 49:52.120
resignation letter, though.

49:54.240 --> 49:56.520
So this is all rather baffling,

49:54.240 --> 49:56.520
isn't it?

49:57.880 --> 49:59.400
The whole point of this case

49:59.560 --> 50:03.120
is that right from the start, nothing has been

49:59.560 --> 50:03.120
what it seems.

50:04.520 --> 50:05.640
In particular,

50:06.520 --> 50:08.440
the cyanide was the cyanide,

50:09.560 --> 50:11.760
but it also wasn't.

50:14.200 --> 50:15.600
Isn't that right, Ellery?

50:18.760 --> 50:20.400
You killed Caroline Bamber.

50:27.280 --> 50:30.000
I was in the kitchen the whole time.

50:30.040 --> 50:32.080
Yes, I know. Clever, weren't you?

50:33.280 --> 50:34.520
Getting a fatal dose of cyanide

50:34.640 --> 50:35.880
into a glass you never went near,

50:35.920 --> 50:38.800
I mean, that's some trick, isn't it?

50:38.840 --> 50:40.720
But then as you well know,

50:41.600 --> 50:43.400
that's not how she was killed.

50:43.720 --> 50:46.920
So thank you for admitting you wrote this

50:43.720 --> 50:46.920
letter just now.

50:50.120 --> 50:51.840
Because we know that this letter

50:51.880 --> 50:54.200
wasn't your attempt to save Caroline's life.

50:54.280 --> 50:56.400
It is, in fact, the murder weapon.

50:57.680 --> 50:58.720
FLORENCE: <i>You wrote the letter.</i>

50:59.320 --> 51:02.280
<i>You then put cyanide</i> <i>on the seal of the envelope.</i>

51:02.760 --> 51:03.760
<i>But not too much.</i>

51:04.320 --> 51:06.160
<i>You didn't want it</i> <i>to act too quickly.</i>

51:06.920 --> 51:08.920
HUMPHREY: <i> And then,</i> <i>just before the party,</i>

51:09.160 --> 51:10.680
<i>you used the trust</i> <i>that you had built up</i>

51:10.800 --> 51:12.400
<i>with Caroline over</i> <i>the last two years...</i>

51:13.160 --> 51:16.360
And told her she had one last

51:13.160 --> 51:16.360
task to perform.

51:16.400 --> 51:17.520
In fact,

51:19.800 --> 51:21.480
we even have a recording

51:23.360 --> 51:24.480
of that exact moment.

51:25.920 --> 51:27.120
ELLERY: <i>One last thing before you go</i>

51:27.240 --> 51:29.120
<i>to the party tonight,</i> <i>Governor.</i>

51:29.160 --> 51:31.240
<i>That donation</i> <i>you wanted to give</i>

51:29.160 --> 51:31.240
<i>to the orphanage chairman,</i>

51:31.960 --> 51:33.960
<i>it's there on</i> <i>the desk for you to check.</i>

51:34.560 --> 51:35.680
And there we have it.

51:37.320 --> 51:38.520
She didn't check the donation.

51:40.120 --> 51:43.480
She did what any boss would do who trusted her

51:40.120 --> 51:43.480
secretary implicitly.

51:43.920 --> 51:45.520
FLORENCE: You knew the orphanage chairman

51:45.880 --> 51:47.680
had cancelled earlier in the day

51:48.120 --> 51:50.440
and that the envelope would therefore be found,

51:50.560 --> 51:52.760
unopened, in Caroline's handbag.

51:53.520 --> 51:55.040
It's there on the desk for you to check.

51:55.200 --> 51:57.000
Oh, I'm sure it'll be fine.

51:57.040 --> 51:59.680
HUMPHREY: <i>She licked and sealed</i>

51:57.040 --> 51:59.680
<i>the envelope, sight unseen.</i>

52:00.480 --> 52:03.760
Not knowing that at that very moment,

52:00.480 --> 52:03.760
she was also sealing her fate.

52:03.800 --> 52:04.960
And then,

52:06.680 --> 52:07.680
well,

52:08.280 --> 52:09.720
as with all cyanide poisonings,

52:10.440 --> 52:12.200
the first thing she felt was a shortness of breath,

52:12.800 --> 52:14.920
what Mr Hammond mistook for nervousness.

52:18.080 --> 52:21.560
And then, as the cyanide began to move

52:18.080 --> 52:21.560
through her bloodstream,

52:21.800 --> 52:23.760
starving her heart and brain of oxygen,

52:24.640 --> 52:25.960
you made sure you were nowhere near.

52:26.520 --> 52:29.440
I'll, er, go and check on the canapes.

52:32.720 --> 52:33.840
CAROLINE: <i> Ah!</i>

52:34.960 --> 52:36.720
FLORENCE: <i> Knowing that</i> <i>after she'd died,</i>

52:36.880 --> 52:39.320
<i>no one would question you</i> <i>being the first</i>

52:36.880 --> 52:39.320
<i>person on the scene.</i>

52:39.880 --> 52:41.880
HUMPHREY: Her trusted secretary.

52:42.680 --> 52:44.800
But you had one last job to do,

52:45.640 --> 52:47.720
and this part was truly inspired.

52:48.560 --> 52:49.960
<i>While everyone was</i> <i>looking at Caroline,</i>

52:50.840 --> 52:52.680
<i>and after she</i> <i>was already dead,</i>

52:52.800 --> 52:56.480
<i>only then did you put</i> <i>a lethal dose of</i>

52:52.800 --> 52:56.480
<i>cyanide into her glass.</i>

52:57.320 --> 52:59.760
Knowing that we would presume it was this cyanide

52:59.800 --> 53:01.000
that had poisoned her.

53:02.120 --> 53:05.240
But that wasn't your only stroke of genius,

53:02.120 --> 53:05.240
Ellery, was it?

53:06.960 --> 53:08.800
Because it was also what you wrote in this letter.

53:10.200 --> 53:11.600
You knew that when we opened it,

53:11.720 --> 53:14.360
we would find apparent proof that Caroline's death

53:14.400 --> 53:15.720
was connected to Spinner's Rock,

53:15.840 --> 53:17.080
which it wasn't, I hasten to add.

53:17.120 --> 53:19.200
But better than that, better than that,

53:19.840 --> 53:21.440
you knew it would never occur to us

53:21.480 --> 53:23.120
that we were holding the real murder weapon

53:23.160 --> 53:24.760
here in our hands.

53:25.320 --> 53:26.880
But why would Ellery, of all people,

53:26.920 --> 53:28.080
want Caroline dead?

53:28.200 --> 53:29.640
HUMPHREY: Exactly.

53:29.680 --> 53:33.200
Caroline was Ellery's mentor, his guardian angel.

53:34.600 --> 53:36.000
So something must have changed.

53:36.040 --> 53:38.920
Something that meant she had to be killed now,

53:38.960 --> 53:40.560
before she left the island.

53:41.920 --> 53:43.440
Well, the day before Caroline's departure,

53:43.480 --> 53:45.480
Ellery was helping her clear her office.

53:46.160 --> 53:48.160
And when I looked among the old documents

53:48.200 --> 53:50.640
that she had buried in the back of her cupboard,

53:52.440 --> 53:53.520
I spotted this.

53:56.800 --> 53:59.320
It was probably the Club Caribbean logo

53:59.360 --> 54:02.000
that caught your eye, too, as it did mine.

54:03.640 --> 54:05.000
This is a proposal

54:05.280 --> 54:08.120
to build a new road for the Club Caribbean

54:05.280 --> 54:08.120
holiday village.

54:09.120 --> 54:13.120
It was written four years ago, 18 months before

54:09.120 --> 54:13.120
your daughter died.

54:14.160 --> 54:17.040
It was asking Caroline for her final approval.

54:18.040 --> 54:19.040
This is what she wrote.

54:19.720 --> 54:22.520
"With negligible fatalities likely

54:19.720 --> 54:22.520
on the existing road,

54:22.560 --> 54:24.920
"the cost of building a new road

54:25.920 --> 54:27.040
"cannot be justified.

54:28.360 --> 54:30.200
"Proposal rejected."

54:30.880 --> 54:32.520
This is why your daughter died.

54:33.880 --> 54:35.680
Because Caroline thought the odd casualty

54:35.720 --> 54:38.000
too expensive to worry about.

54:39.240 --> 54:40.720
This is what you learned

54:40.760 --> 54:43.000
when you were helping her clear out her office that day.

54:44.040 --> 54:47.800
<i>Which is when you</i> <i>finally understood,</i>

54:44.040 --> 54:47.800
<i>isn't it, Ellery?</i>

54:47.840 --> 54:50.120
<i>Everything</i> <i>Caroline had told you</i>

54:47.840 --> 54:50.120
<i>had been a lie.</i>

54:50.480 --> 54:51.480
<i>Your promotion,</i>

54:52.600 --> 54:55.040
<i>putting a new road</i> <i>to bypass your village, even,</i>

54:55.080 --> 54:57.160
<i>it was all about her, her.</i>

54:57.600 --> 55:00.400
<i>And her attempt to</i> <i>get rid of her guilt.</i>

55:01.280 --> 55:04.880
All because she knew she'd caused your

55:01.280 --> 55:04.880
daughter's death.

55:04.920 --> 55:05.960
HUMPHREY: In a way,

55:06.920 --> 55:10.080
that road was the death of her,

55:06.920 --> 55:10.080
too, wasn't it?

55:13.160 --> 55:15.160
You know the last words she heard?

55:16.880 --> 55:18.880
Negligible fatalities.

55:19.000 --> 55:21.400
<i>She knew exactly what I meant.</i>

55:37.640 --> 55:39.360
Well done, Inspector.

55:39.480 --> 55:41.160
A team effort as always, sir.

55:41.720 --> 55:47.360
Erm, I, er, wanted to say sorry for the, er, well,

55:41.720 --> 55:47.360
awkwardness.

55:47.640 --> 55:49.280
No awkwardness.

55:49.320 --> 55:51.840
Just as long as you keep on catching your man.

56:01.560 --> 56:02.600
She's replied.

56:02.840 --> 56:03.920
Miss 94%, she's replied.

56:04.040 --> 56:05.200
No way.

56:06.960 --> 56:08.880
"The subscription for the individual

56:09.000 --> 56:11.160
"you are trying to contact has lapsed."

56:12.280 --> 56:13.360
What?

56:13.720 --> 56:14.760
She's gone.

56:15.120 --> 56:17.040
Oh, no. This can't be happening,

56:15.120 --> 56:17.040
this can't be.

56:18.000 --> 56:19.080
Please.

56:21.920 --> 56:23.320
My perfect girl.

56:23.360 --> 56:25.560
Ah, don't worry, Chief. It's not the end of the world.

56:26.480 --> 56:27.520
You're right, Dwayne.

56:27.840 --> 56:29.080
Well, I'm just going to have to

56:27.840 --> 56:29.080
track her down.

56:29.640 --> 56:31.440
-I don't follow. -Well, she lives

56:29.640 --> 56:31.440
in the Caribbean.

56:31.560 --> 56:33.000
If I look hard enough, visit enough islands,

56:33.040 --> 56:34.600
I'm bound to find her eventually,

56:33.040 --> 56:34.600
aren't I?

56:35.520 --> 56:36.640
Eventually? Yes.

56:43.440 --> 56:44.560
So,

56:45.760 --> 56:47.920
are you going to help him track down this girl?

56:48.440 --> 56:51.040
What? And go on a wild goose chase

56:48.440 --> 56:51.040
around the Caribbean?

56:51.080 --> 56:52.760
No, sir. Count me out.

56:53.680 --> 56:56.120
I wish I'd never agreed to help him

56:53.680 --> 56:56.120
in the first place.

56:56.920 --> 56:58.000
I mean, what can you with a man

56:58.120 --> 56:59.520
who falls in love with a percentage?

57:05.400 --> 57:07.080
You know, I'm beginning to wonder

57:07.200 --> 57:09.160
if Dwayne is the right wingman for me.

57:10.720 --> 57:12.280
Really, Humphrey, why?

57:12.320 --> 57:14.360
A slight clash of styles, perhaps.

57:15.120 --> 57:16.200
CATHERINE: Hmm.

57:17.240 --> 57:18.880
Maybe you're right.

57:20.200 --> 57:23.280
So, Florence, do you think I should go on

57:20.200 --> 57:23.280
a search for Miss 94%?

57:23.800 --> 57:25.840
I suppose it would put off the day

57:25.880 --> 57:28.240
when you had to actually speak

57:25.880 --> 57:28.240
to a woman, sir.

57:28.280 --> 57:31.160
Yes, I see. You think I'm hiding

57:28.280 --> 57:31.160
behind a screen, so to speak.

57:31.680 --> 57:32.760
Perhaps.

57:33.160 --> 57:34.280
Right.

57:38.640 --> 57:39.800
I've decided something.

57:39.920 --> 57:41.000
-Yes.

57:41.560 --> 57:43.600
I've decided I'm not going to scour the Caribbean

57:43.640 --> 57:45.200
for some tenuous Internet fantasy.

57:46.000 --> 57:48.080
-No. No more relying

57:46.000 --> 57:48.080
on algorithms

57:48.120 --> 57:49.600
to find the future Mrs Humphrey.

57:49.840 --> 57:50.840
Er, the second.

57:51.560 --> 57:54.960
I'm going to talk to some real, live women.

57:55.080 --> 57:58.880
I'll be brave, confident and well, who knows,

57:58.920 --> 58:01.000
maybe I'll somehow manage to bowl one of them over.

58:02.200 --> 58:03.440
Crikey.

58:03.480 --> 58:05.280
-Bottoms up! -Yes, aye!

58:10.160 --> 58:11.280
J.P.: <i> One of the models</i> <i>was found dead.</i>

58:11.400 --> 58:12.760
<i>She appears to</i> <i>have been strangled.</i>

58:13.600 --> 58:15.920
Make a woman laugh and you're halfway there.

58:16.280 --> 58:17.640
-Practise on Catherine. -Oh.

58:17.840 --> 58:18.960
Try and make her smile.

58:19.320 --> 58:20.480
HUMPHREY: <i>...time I played rugby</i>

58:19.320 --> 58:20.480
<i>at school.</i>

58:21.120 --> 58:24.040
I did my best but all anyone could say was,

58:21.120 --> 58:24.040
"Nice try."

58:24.080 --> 58:26.160
Oh, it was kind of them.

58:26.640 --> 58:29.920
These women have been traumatised.

58:26.640 --> 58:29.920
They need handling gently.

58:29.960 --> 58:31.960
J.P.: <i> One of them</i> <i>could be our killer.</i>

58:29.960 --> 58:31.960
DWAYNE: <i> You're right!</i>

58:32.480 --> 58:34.200
But what about the other two, eh?
