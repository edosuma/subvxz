WEBVTT

00:01.084 --> 00:02.506
<i>Previously on Hit The Floor:</i>

00:02.628 --> 00:05.757
I let you drown.
Not running after you when you left

00:05.923 --> 00:09.644
- was the strongest thing I did.
- You've done more than you know.

00:09.760 --> 00:13.936
You wouldn't have this stuff
if it weren't for me. I am so, so sorry.

00:14.056 --> 00:18.186
If I did kiss you on purpose, it's not
because I was going off of nothing.

00:21.897 --> 00:25.071
He's a murderer. Mia, remember her?
She did things for Oscar.

00:25.192 --> 00:27.194
He would have her wear a microphone.

00:27.319 --> 00:29.947
- A microphone?
- I didn't kill Olivia.

00:30.113 --> 00:32.207
- He did it.
- You talking about Oscar?

00:32.658 --> 00:35.707
German's my go-to because
he didn't throw coke in my purse.

00:35.827 --> 00:37.374
And he didn't put me in jail.

00:37.496 --> 00:40.375
- I haven't trusted you since.
- Now I don't trust you.

00:40.541 --> 00:43.511
You can go to German
all you want now. I'm done.

01:27.254 --> 01:29.598
<i>- HEY-
- HEY-</i>

01:31.925 --> 01:33.268
I got your text.

01:33.427 --> 01:36.931
This is everything you left
at my place.

01:37.472 --> 01:40.601
- Thanks.
- No problem.

01:45.272 --> 01:46.990
Take care.

01:48.900 --> 01:50.618
You too.

01:59.578 --> 02:01.421
No, no, no.

02:01.580 --> 02:03.298
Stay.

02:04.875 --> 02:06.627
We're in the playoffs.

02:06.793 --> 02:08.716
I have so much work to do.

02:08.878 --> 02:10.222
We both kind of do.

02:10.380 --> 02:13.350
I don't care.
I'm never letting you go again.

02:14.635 --> 02:16.228
<i>Hey-</i>

02:18.347 --> 02:20.395
It's different now.

02:20.557 --> 02:21.979
I'm not going anywhere.

02:30.942 --> 02:33.821
Got it. Thanks.

02:36.740 --> 02:39.414
- Everything okay?
- Yeah.

02:44.998 --> 02:46.545
No.

02:46.875 --> 02:50.004
I have an appointment in San Diego
with Joel Asako tomorrow.

02:50.128 --> 02:52.677
- The ortho doctor.
- The best.

02:52.839 --> 02:55.342
Can't even get five minutes
with this guy.

02:55.509 --> 02:58.513
- That's great.
- I don't wanna see him.

02:59.763 --> 03:01.765
Why wouldn't you meet with him?

03:01.932 --> 03:05.402
Because there's obviously
a serious problem.

03:05.519 --> 03:07.362
You know there's a serious problem.

03:07.854 --> 03:11.609
- He could have a solution.
- And I don't know if I wanna hear it.

03:17.030 --> 03:18.953
I'll go with you.

03:31.753 --> 03:34.723
You don't have to go through
this stuff now.

03:34.881 --> 03:38.636
You can shove it in a closet
and deal with it when you're ready.

03:38.802 --> 03:40.145
I knew he was wild.

03:41.221 --> 03:42.894
I just...

03:43.890 --> 03:46.143
I thought I was strong enough
to handle it.

03:46.309 --> 03:49.108
You were too strong to put up with it.

03:49.604 --> 03:52.949
A player's life
is filled with temptations.

03:53.108 --> 03:57.409
Temptations some are unwilling
or unable to ignore.

03:57.571 --> 04:00.871
Hangers-on, late nights, drugs.

04:02.784 --> 04:04.536
You knew?

04:06.705 --> 04:10.835
You knew and you didn't try to drag me
away from him kicking and screaming.

04:11.042 --> 04:14.262
Who are you, and what have you done
with my mother?

04:16.714 --> 04:18.466
People can change.

04:18.632 --> 04:20.305
I did.

04:21.052 --> 04:22.895
So did Pete.

04:25.182 --> 04:28.777
Ahsha, this may be the worst time
to tell you this.

04:28.935 --> 04:31.984
- You're hurting over Derek--
- You and Pete hooked up.

04:32.689 --> 04:35.693
- Hooked up?
- Well, am I right? I'm right.

04:35.859 --> 04:38.658
We did not hook up.
We are trying again.

04:39.613 --> 04:42.867
- For real?
- For real.

04:44.326 --> 04:48.172
I'm happy for you,
and I'm happy for him too.

04:54.795 --> 04:57.389
"Derek Roman's girl."

04:59.257 --> 05:02.136
- You okay?
- It's not the picture. It's the caption.

05:02.844 --> 05:04.187
I don't even have a name.

05:04.304 --> 05:07.524
Well, now's your chance
to make one.

05:17.317 --> 05:21.197
Kyle. You have been a tricky girl
to get alone this week.

05:21.363 --> 05:25.084
Last on the floor, first off.
Every time I call, I get your voice mail.

05:25.200 --> 05:27.043
I got a lot going on. You know me.

05:27.160 --> 05:29.629
And the reception in my apartment
is atrocious.

05:29.746 --> 05:32.420
I'll have another job for you
in the next few days.

05:32.958 --> 05:36.212
You might wanna get in touch
with your cell phone company.

05:36.378 --> 05:38.506
This opportunity,

05:38.672 --> 05:41.175
you're not gonna want it
to go to voice mail.

06:01.319 --> 06:03.162
So that's it?

06:04.489 --> 06:06.617
You seemed pretty satisfied
a minute ago.

06:08.660 --> 06:10.662
What are we doing?

06:12.038 --> 06:14.541
- We're having a good time.
- You've done this?

06:15.417 --> 06:17.636
Had a good time with a guy before?

06:19.629 --> 06:21.097
I've been with men.

06:21.256 --> 06:24.260
And women. And men and women.

06:25.677 --> 06:27.099
It's not deep, Jude,

06:27.220 --> 06:29.348
because I don't make it deep.

06:29.514 --> 06:30.857
I don't do relationships.

06:32.434 --> 06:35.028
Funny because it seemed the minute
you met Jelena

06:35.103 --> 06:38.482
- you were trying to lock her down.
- That was part of the plan.

06:38.607 --> 06:42.487
Falling for her wasn't. It makes you
wonder if you're only here with me

06:42.652 --> 06:46.373
- because you can't be with her.
- That's why I don't do relationships.

06:46.489 --> 06:48.662
I can't deal with conversations
like this.

06:48.742 --> 06:52.747
Only thing that matters is busting open
the rift between Derek and Terrence.

06:52.871 --> 06:56.466
We can keep having fun or not.
Up to you.

07:03.798 --> 07:07.473
I had to tell Kyle. She needed to know
what she might be getting into.

07:07.594 --> 07:10.564
I wish you would've talked to me.
I know you are friends.

07:10.680 --> 07:13.524
- And no of fence to Kyle.
- None taken.

07:14.100 --> 07:15.477
Nice place, by the way.

07:16.061 --> 07:18.314
- Did you have to tell her everything?
- No.

07:18.438 --> 07:20.987
She tried not to,
but I can be pretty persuasive.

07:21.149 --> 07:24.619
Having a hard time believing
Oscar's done things y'all are saying.

07:24.736 --> 07:26.830
I can't do another thing till I know.

07:26.988 --> 07:30.288
We're looking for proof
Oscar paid off the medical examiner.

07:30.450 --> 07:32.953
- You won't find it.
- Why do you say that?

07:33.078 --> 07:35.672
The men Oscar does business with
don't need money.

07:35.789 --> 07:38.884
What they want, you can only buy
with nature's credit card.

07:39.668 --> 07:42.672
Mia said Oscar sent her to men.

07:43.338 --> 07:45.466
Maybe that's how the ME was paid.

07:46.091 --> 07:48.594
- How do you prove that?
- Easy.

07:48.760 --> 07:50.603
I go over and pay the ME a visit.

07:50.762 --> 07:52.639
No, there's too much we don't know.

07:52.764 --> 07:55.517
Too much that could go wrong.
We'll find another way.

08:03.233 --> 08:05.736
Pete. Come sit.

08:05.860 --> 08:09.410
We got tickets for the premiere.
Afterparty is supposed to be huge.

08:09.531 --> 08:11.158
Mixologist, champagne fountain.

08:11.324 --> 08:13.167
I'm not drinking anymore.

08:19.249 --> 08:22.173
I'm guessing you're here to drop off
the divorce papers.

08:22.502 --> 08:24.846
Your lawyer already has them.

08:25.005 --> 08:27.884
I just wanted to tell you in person.

08:28.341 --> 08:29.843
Right.

08:30.051 --> 08:33.225
Well, you didn't have to drive
all the way out here for that.

08:33.346 --> 08:35.019
I'm a big girl.

08:37.100 --> 08:40.479
I really have a lotto do
before the red carpet, so...

08:40.854 --> 08:43.653
- I don't mean to be rude.
- Hey, I just--

08:44.065 --> 08:45.908
I'll let you get to it.

08:47.902 --> 08:49.700
Bye, Lionel.

08:54.284 --> 08:56.002
Bye, Pete.

09:01.207 --> 09:04.427
Thanks. Go from there, right? Okay.

09:08.923 --> 09:11.176
I'm off the clock tomorrow.

09:15.221 --> 09:16.643
You're never off the clock.

09:17.599 --> 09:19.897
There's a first time for everything.

09:20.060 --> 09:24.486
That's unfortunate because, actually,
I have to move rehearsal to tomorrow.

09:26.066 --> 09:27.443
We never move rehearsal.

09:28.359 --> 09:31.078
There's a first time for everything.

09:32.906 --> 09:36.706
That dance may be the last
of the season. It needs to be epic.

09:38.787 --> 09:40.539
Oh, it Will be.

09:43.541 --> 09:46.385
Sloane, I didn't know
you had this in you.

09:47.295 --> 09:51.050
Maybe if you spent less time
hunting photographs,

09:51.174 --> 09:52.676
you could learn a few things.

10:01.059 --> 10:04.108
I'm sorry I put you through all that,
Ahsha. What you did--

10:04.229 --> 10:05.572
It's what my morn did.

10:06.397 --> 10:08.570
I just brought you two together.
Again.

10:09.192 --> 10:10.535
And now, you're together.

10:10.693 --> 10:13.162
- Again.
- Yeah, well, it's different this time.

10:13.279 --> 10:15.452
We're not the old Pete and Sloane.

10:15.615 --> 10:17.709
We're the new and improved models.

10:17.784 --> 10:20.207
Derek and I, on the other hand,
malfunctioned.

10:20.328 --> 10:21.705
I heard.

10:21.830 --> 10:23.207
Look, he may be my starter

10:23.623 --> 10:25.500
but you are my daughter.

10:25.625 --> 10:27.298
So I'm Team Ahsha all the way.

10:27.460 --> 10:31.055
You don't have to worry about me.
I'm new and improved too.

10:31.422 --> 10:33.641
I've got plans.

10:37.971 --> 10:39.268
Care to partake?

10:39.430 --> 10:42.058
- I'm good.
- Oh, you can't turn these down.

10:42.183 --> 10:44.857
These aren't donuts, okay?
These are cronuts.

10:45.019 --> 10:48.023
Flaky croissant,
lightly deep-fried deliciousness.

10:48.481 --> 10:52.327
- Cut the bribery, cut to the chase.
- I want the scoop on the breakup.

10:52.443 --> 10:55.162
Want a quote about
my ex-girlfriend's ex-boyfriend?

10:55.321 --> 10:58.325
DerSha used to be GerSha.

10:58.491 --> 11:00.243
That's interesting.

11:00.410 --> 11:03.334
- Anything you care to share?
- Yeah.

11:03.955 --> 11:05.332
No comment.

11:05.456 --> 11:07.208
You're leaving me with no choice.

11:07.333 --> 11:09.586
I'm gonna have to pitch a segment
about you.

11:09.752 --> 11:14.633
Devils' dashing new assistant coach,
one-third of DerSha love triangle.

11:16.301 --> 11:18.895
- You wanna interview me?
- Does Pete Davenport

11:19.053 --> 11:20.396
like the triangle of fence?

11:22.599 --> 11:24.977
Fine. Tomorrow, after work.

11:25.101 --> 11:26.444
It's a date.

11:26.603 --> 11:29.823
Well, not a "date" date.

11:32.192 --> 11:33.990
Of course not.

11:35.153 --> 11:36.530
You know the deal.

11:36.696 --> 11:40.166
You'll dance a segment of a routine,
the rest of us will vote.

11:40.325 --> 11:44.626
This is a team decision as to who's
gonna cover choreography this week.

11:45.288 --> 11:46.961
Let's go.

11:49.792 --> 11:52.671
- Go, Christine.
- Go, Christine.

11:55.381 --> 11:56.724
Yeah!

11:59.928 --> 12:02.556
- Love it!
- Go, Ahsha!

12:05.308 --> 12:07.060
Yeah!

12:09.270 --> 12:11.193
- All right.
- Yeah! Come on.

12:30.124 --> 12:31.876
Yes!

12:34.045 --> 12:36.139
Good job, Ahsha.

12:36.297 --> 12:39.972
And with that,
I thought we could work wardrobe in.

12:40.134 --> 12:42.603
- Who wants to perform Ahsha's dance?
- Me.

12:49.352 --> 12:52.572
Looks like you're gonna be
choreographing a playoff game.

12:57.277 --> 12:59.621
I need a plus-one for my premiere.
You free?

13:00.363 --> 13:03.082
What's up with you and Pete?
He's already decked me.

13:03.199 --> 13:06.078
- I'm not looking to start drama.
- It's not a problem.

13:06.202 --> 13:08.421
Drama-free.
Unless you're seeing someone.

13:09.789 --> 13:11.211
I am seeing someone.

13:13.084 --> 13:16.054
They won't care. Don't seem
to be the possessive type.

13:18.214 --> 13:19.966
You said "they" twice.

13:20.133 --> 13:21.885
You're playing the pronoun game.

13:22.051 --> 13:23.849
My brother played
the pronoun game.

13:23.970 --> 13:26.894
Wound up married to a gay biker
in Providence.

13:27.515 --> 13:29.062
You're loving on a guy.

13:33.479 --> 13:35.026
Okay.

13:35.398 --> 13:39.278
He's not a biker in Providence,
but, yeah, it's a guy.

13:39.444 --> 13:41.742
Oh, you have to take me
to the premiere now.

13:41.821 --> 13:43.664
You're tolerable, you're handsome.

13:43.781 --> 13:46.705
You're not gonna try to get me
into bed. You're perfect.

13:53.124 --> 13:55.843
I can't meet tonight.
I have something I need to do.

13:55.960 --> 13:57.337
What's that?

13:57.420 --> 14:00.173
- Go to Olivia's.
- Police have been all through it.

14:00.298 --> 14:03.302
But they didn't have
the medical examiner's name. We do.

14:03.593 --> 14:05.687
Raquel,
the proof we've been looking for

14:05.803 --> 14:07.305
connecting Oscar to the ME,

14:07.472 --> 14:09.270
proof we haven't been able
to find,

14:09.432 --> 14:11.560
it could be
in Olivia's personal papers.

14:12.560 --> 14:16.030
- Be careful no one sees you.
- I'll go late, avoid neighbours.

14:23.279 --> 14:25.202
You need to have surgery
immediately.

14:25.323 --> 14:28.293
I need time. It could be
a couple of days, maybe a month.

14:28.409 --> 14:30.036
You don't have a month.

14:30.203 --> 14:34.003
Because you didn't have surgery,
you're not only risking your career

14:34.165 --> 14:37.419
you're risking life after your career.
Your ability to walk.

14:39.170 --> 14:43.346
Treatment plan I've created will have
you back on the court in six months.

14:43.466 --> 14:46.015
- Today's surgery--
- There won't be a surgery.

14:46.803 --> 14:50.148
We appreciate your time,
but his mind is made up.

14:51.974 --> 14:54.193
Look, you're the best ortho
in the country.

14:55.186 --> 14:58.986
Come up with a treatment plan that
will take him through the postseason.

14:59.065 --> 15:01.193
Once he's done, you can cut away.

15:07.281 --> 15:10.285
I'll rework the treatment schedule.

15:10.618 --> 15:12.086
Give me a few minutes, okay?

15:20.711 --> 15:22.338
Thank you.

15:23.381 --> 15:27.602
When one of the girls gets injured,
we cover them in the routines.

15:27.760 --> 15:30.604
You need someone
who can cover you on the court.

15:32.557 --> 15:33.900
You need to tell Derek.

15:40.523 --> 15:42.196
Hello?

16:09.218 --> 16:10.970
Sloane.

16:12.680 --> 16:14.307
I wish you hadn't come.

16:14.974 --> 16:16.271
Chase.

16:16.434 --> 16:19.062
You're in prison.
What are you doing here?

16:19.145 --> 16:22.149
They screwed up the search warrant
on my car.

16:22.315 --> 16:25.785
That shovel that Oscar planted
was inadmissible.

16:26.611 --> 16:28.909
They don't have anything else,
can't hold me.

16:29.030 --> 16:30.828
Why isn't this on the news?

16:30.948 --> 16:32.916
They're embarrassed,
keeping it quiet.

16:33.910 --> 16:36.208
They're gonna still try to pin this
on me.

16:36.370 --> 16:38.122
I'm not going back in that cage.

16:40.249 --> 16:41.796
How did you know I was here?

16:44.170 --> 16:45.547
You're running.

16:45.713 --> 16:49.183
Be easy for you to call the cops,
let them know that I'm leaving.

16:49.300 --> 16:51.268
- Chase--
- And if it was easy for me

16:51.385 --> 16:54.935
to push my own wife to her death,
pushing you would be no problem.

16:55.097 --> 16:57.145
I mean, I'd have to.

16:57.808 --> 16:59.936
But I'm not a murderer.

17:01.354 --> 17:03.402
Oscar is.

17:04.982 --> 17:06.733
I don't know about Olivia

17:06.901 --> 17:10.326
but I know he killed Mia.
I've been looking into her death.

17:10.488 --> 17:13.412
I know he's responsible,
and you could help me prove it.

17:13.532 --> 17:16.787
I need a connection between Oscar
and the medical examiner

17:16.953 --> 17:18.626
who handled Mia's death.

17:18.746 --> 17:20.748
Give that to me,
I could take him down.

17:21.665 --> 17:23.839
You'd like that, wouldn't you?

17:26.420 --> 17:29.549
I don't know anything
about a medical examiner.

17:33.844 --> 17:37.098
I have a storage unit
with a bunch of stuff from the arena.

17:37.223 --> 17:39.317
None of it looked like anything
to me.

17:41.561 --> 17:43.984
But it might mean something to you.

17:47.733 --> 17:49.326
The old Chase would've stayed

17:49.485 --> 17:52.238
and dragged Oscar
in front of every judge and jury.

17:52.405 --> 17:55.534
No one will listen to me, Sloane.
He'd make sure of that.

17:55.700 --> 17:58.670
How can he do that?
You're Chase Vincent.

18:00.079 --> 18:02.502
What does he have over you?

18:08.754 --> 18:10.097
I raped Mia.

18:11.882 --> 18:13.805
That night, I thought--

18:15.011 --> 18:17.230
It didn't matter what I thought.

18:18.389 --> 18:20.608
That's what sent her running
to Oscar.

18:20.766 --> 18:23.110
And running from Oscar.

18:23.936 --> 18:27.406
Always looking over her shoulder.
Never stopping.

18:30.943 --> 18:33.071
Now, I'm gonna know
what that feels like.

18:52.048 --> 18:54.267
My leg's messed up.

18:56.719 --> 18:59.723
- How bad?
- Bad.

19:01.223 --> 19:03.100
Does coach know?

19:04.393 --> 19:06.020
No one knows.

19:08.564 --> 19:10.316
<i>L</i> 90'! you.

19:31.253 --> 19:34.553
That was great.
Just be careful with the pop, and a pop.

19:34.715 --> 19:36.092
Make sure that's sharp.

19:36.258 --> 19:39.387
One more time, from the top.
Five, six, seven.

19:39.553 --> 19:41.100
The routine is set.

19:41.222 --> 19:43.145
So either you can get in line

19:43.265 --> 19:45.313
or you can sit this one out.

19:49.522 --> 19:50.899
Yes, good job, guys. Work.

19:51.315 --> 19:53.158
All right.

19:55.528 --> 19:59.374
Body double. You mean I didn't
have to do all that nudity myself?

20:00.116 --> 20:03.962
Now, I couldn't help but notice your
date tonight is not Pete Davenport.

20:05.162 --> 20:08.257
I never wear the same man
to a premiere twice.

20:09.166 --> 20:11.464
Chase Vincent's out?

20:11.627 --> 20:13.550
When? How?

20:14.255 --> 20:17.179
How does Pete feel
about you doing a movie like this?

20:17.299 --> 20:19.893
I'm my own woman.
That's what this movie's about.

20:20.052 --> 20:22.976
- Thank you so much.
- Thanks, Lionel, thank you.

20:29.353 --> 20:32.323
I'm gonna get my lunch money stolen,
aren't I?

20:32.773 --> 20:34.275
I went to high school here.

20:34.442 --> 20:35.785
Then I taught PE here

20:35.901 --> 20:39.701
so you can't pitch a piece on me
without including this place.

20:39.822 --> 20:42.371
Okay. Start there.

20:42.533 --> 20:45.036
How does a guy go
from gym teacher one day

20:45.202 --> 20:47.296
to pro ball coach the next?

20:47.455 --> 20:49.833
I just had a dream
and pushed to make it real.

20:49.999 --> 20:53.720
If you wanna feed me platitude,
buy me Chicken Soup for the <i>Soul.</i>

20:53.836 --> 20:55.838
I'm not into sharing
personal details.

20:56.005 --> 20:59.726
That's how this interview thing
works, but if you don't wanna do this,

20:59.884 --> 21:02.387
- that's cool.
- Okay. How about this?

21:06.307 --> 21:09.811
I'll give you a straight answer
for every basket you sink.

21:12.688 --> 21:14.156
Game on.

21:14.315 --> 21:15.988
All right.

21:21.906 --> 21:23.954
In heels.

21:24.700 --> 21:26.828
- Nice.
- That's right.

21:35.669 --> 21:37.797
It wasn't that bad.
Don't worry about it.

21:37.922 --> 21:41.267
- I didn't get that one part.
- I didn't get the whole movie.

21:43.803 --> 21:45.726
Honestly, I'm all out of questions.

21:45.888 --> 21:47.686
I might know everything about you.

21:47.807 --> 21:51.061
- I don't know anything about you.
- What do you wanna know?

21:52.645 --> 21:55.444
- Do you have a boyfriend?
- Not that I know of.

21:56.232 --> 21:59.111
Inside Sports Network
was never gonna do a story on me.

21:59.235 --> 22:03.160
So this had to be about gossip,
which I was never gonna give you.

22:03.322 --> 22:07.043
I knew you wouldn't. I could tell
you weren't that kind of guy.

22:08.202 --> 22:10.296
But this was never about gossip.

22:26.387 --> 22:27.855
Derek, Terrence, come here.

22:27.972 --> 22:30.646
You guys run that back! Run it again.

22:31.350 --> 22:34.320
- Something I should know about?
- What do you mean?

22:35.062 --> 22:37.030
It's dragging ass out there.

22:38.774 --> 22:41.653
My back's a little stiff.
I mean, it's nothing serious.

22:41.777 --> 22:43.745
- I was at my club.
- At your club?

22:43.821 --> 22:45.823
Sorry, coach.

22:47.741 --> 22:49.493
All right, that's it! We're done!

22:49.618 --> 22:51.086
- Showers.
- We're good.

22:51.203 --> 22:53.422
See the trainer. Get some treatment.

22:55.416 --> 22:57.714
Thanks for covering for me.

22:57.877 --> 23:00.676
I told you, I got you.

23:06.260 --> 23:08.604
<i>It's a sold-out crowd here
at Devils Arena</i>

23:08.762 --> 23:12.016
<i>as Los Angeles hosts Phoenix
in the conference finals.</i>

23:18.647 --> 23:20.240
You Okay?

23:20.357 --> 23:22.109
Yeah. I choreographed this dance.

23:23.861 --> 23:27.832
Yeah. If the announcer doesn't call us
onto the floor in the next 3O seconds

23:27.948 --> 23:30.622
I'm gonna be throwing up
instead of dancing it.

23:30.951 --> 23:33.955
You got this way every time
you choreographed in college.

23:34.079 --> 23:36.923
The more nervous you were,
the better the dance was.

23:37.041 --> 23:39.760
Then, this should be the performance
of my lifetime.

23:39.877 --> 23:43.598
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to the conference finals.</i>

23:44.089 --> 23:46.183
<i>And now, Devils Nation,</i>

23:46.300 --> 23:50.100
<i>put your hands together
for your Los Angeles Devil Girls.</i>

25:53.594 --> 25:58.191
<i>Devils Nation, let's hear it again
for your Los Angeles Devil Girls.</i>

26:03.854 --> 26:05.982
<i>What an exciting game here
tonight, folks.</i>

26:06.106 --> 26:08.700
<i>The Devils down by two
with time running out.</i>

26:09.318 --> 26:12.037
<i>Phoenix in-bounds the ball,
dribbles to half-court.</i>

26:12.154 --> 26:14.873
- Watch the shooter!
- Looking for a man to pass to.

26:14.990 --> 26:19.666
<i>Terrence Wall steals the ball. A break
down the lane with six seconds left.</i>

26:19.787 --> 26:23.132
<i>Terrence dishes to Derek.
Roman shoots a three, and it is--</i>

26:24.124 --> 26:26.343
<i>- Devils win! Devils win!
- Yes!</i>

26:26.460 --> 26:29.009
<i>- Yes!
- Devils are the conference champions.</i>

26:29.171 --> 26:33.893
<i>- What an end to an exciting game.
- How about that, huh?</i>

26:34.051 --> 26:36.179
<i>Our boys pulled it off this season.</i>

26:36.261 --> 26:38.184
That closed up the show.
Champions!

26:38.305 --> 26:40.182
- Yeah, you did it!
- You did it.

26:42.976 --> 26:45.650
- You did it.
- We did it, as a team.

26:46.021 --> 26:49.776
Your advice may be the reason
the Devils are going to the finals.

26:49.900 --> 26:51.948
<i>Devils! Devils! Devils!</i>

26:52.986 --> 26:55.409
- More games, more dances.
- Something was off

26:55.531 --> 26:58.705
with tonight's dance. People loved it,
but you weren't in it.

26:58.826 --> 27:01.375
I didn't choreograph this.
I missed rehearsal.

27:02.538 --> 27:05.291
- Because you were in San Diego?
- Doesn't matter.

27:05.457 --> 27:08.506
The rest of the dances will be mine.

27:08.669 --> 27:10.512
<i>Devils! Devils! Devils!</i>

27:10.671 --> 27:12.218
<i>Devils! Devils!</i>

27:14.591 --> 27:17.686
Oscar, shouldn't you be celebrating
at the Playground?

27:18.178 --> 27:20.556
I'll celebrate when we win the title.
Sit.

27:22.432 --> 27:24.901
I wanna thank you for coming back
to the games,

27:25.018 --> 27:27.146
but I'm reassigning your seat.

27:27.312 --> 27:28.780
You can't get much closer.

27:29.356 --> 27:31.700
Unfortunately,
I have nothing closer for you.

27:35.529 --> 27:36.826
I've been at every game

27:36.989 --> 27:39.412
smiling at the cameras
where you wanted me.

27:40.742 --> 27:43.962
My movie opens this weekend.
I actually need to be there now.

27:44.079 --> 27:48.334
That seat isn't gonna save your movie.
I've heard the buzz. Smells like a bomb.

27:50.002 --> 27:52.471
You've been chasing me all year.

27:52.629 --> 27:55.473
- And now that I'm of no use to you--
- Hold on.

27:55.632 --> 27:57.726
I never said that.

27:59.428 --> 28:03.478
You have a movie about to flop.
You're freshly divorced.

28:04.641 --> 28:08.066
- Pete told you?
- It's public knowledge.

28:08.395 --> 28:09.897
Unlike my recent divorce

28:10.022 --> 28:13.276
which I managed
to keep nice and quiet.

28:13.650 --> 28:15.948
But it doesn't mean
the pain's not real.

28:20.073 --> 28:22.747
You're hurting, I'm hurting.

28:23.744 --> 28:26.748
Maybe we can make each other
feel better.

28:26.914 --> 28:29.963
I haven't been coy
about how attractive I find you.

28:30.709 --> 28:32.302
Pete's your friend.

28:32.461 --> 28:35.010
Exactly,
so we'd need to keep it private.

28:35.589 --> 28:37.136
You may be interested to know

28:38.675 --> 28:40.973
secrets turn me on.

28:47.267 --> 28:49.361
I'm not interested
in what turns you on.

28:52.022 --> 28:53.615
Or anything else about you.

28:57.861 --> 28:59.829
You'll be back.

29:00.197 --> 29:02.950
I tend to be right about these things.

29:30.269 --> 29:34.149
So just get the cheque to table number
five, and as soon as-- I'm sorry.

29:34.731 --> 29:37.735
- Hey, I can't really talk.
- You don't have to <i>talk.</i>

29:37.901 --> 29:41.451
<i>I'm in Chase's storage unit,
and I found a list of routing numbers,</i>

29:41.613 --> 29:43.035
<i>dollar amounts and dates.</i>

29:43.198 --> 29:46.327
The dates match every Devils game
last season.

29:46.451 --> 29:47.794
They're gambling winnings.

29:48.412 --> 29:51.382
- We have <i>him for corruption.</i>
<i>- All the police have to do</i>

29:51.498 --> 29:54.422
<i>is trace each number
and they'll have Oscar's investors.</i>

29:54.501 --> 29:57.129
From there,
it's one straight shot to the casinos.

29:57.754 --> 30:02.555
It's not Mia's murder,
but this will put Oscar behind bars.

30:02.968 --> 30:05.266
We got him. We need to meet.

30:05.429 --> 30:06.851
<i>- Where's Kyle?
- No idea.</i>

30:07.014 --> 30:09.858
I've been calling her.
Going straight to voice mail.

30:09.975 --> 30:12.854
I expected a medical examiner's office
to be creepier.

30:13.020 --> 30:16.866
Oh, if it's creepier you want,
I'll give you a tour of the morgue.

30:19.109 --> 30:22.659
I told you, you don't have to get me
drunk to take advantage of me.

30:22.779 --> 30:26.249
Honey, I would never do that.

30:33.790 --> 30:37.135
You're something. How come
Oscar's never sent you to me before?

30:37.252 --> 30:39.755
Well, obviously,
his last girl couldn't make it.

30:41.214 --> 30:44.263
- What do you know about her?
- She didn't know her place.

30:45.594 --> 30:48.689
Yeah.
It's a shame what happened to her.

30:48.847 --> 30:51.691
I don't make those calls.
I just clean up the messes.

30:51.808 --> 30:54.106
Mia, that was a big mess.

30:54.936 --> 30:58.065
Gotta give Oscar credit.
He knows his way around a blonde.

30:58.190 --> 31:00.568
I mean, Mia was a good one.

31:01.276 --> 31:02.619
But Olivia.

31:02.778 --> 31:04.780
Oh, back in the day.

31:05.697 --> 31:08.951
Back in the day, Olivia was the best.

31:52.285 --> 31:56.290
Can't believe it. You said you were
gonna take us to the finals. You did it.

31:56.415 --> 31:59.464
- I'm not finished yet.
- You bet your ass you're not.

32:02.421 --> 32:05.265
- I need to take this.
- You got it.

32:06.842 --> 32:10.096
- Hello?
- Hey. It's Zaskin.

32:10.220 --> 32:13.269
I wanted to call and thank you
for that girl you sent over.

32:13.390 --> 32:15.893
I ain't gonna lie.
She drank me under the table.

32:17.436 --> 32:19.234
What girl?

32:21.690 --> 32:24.910
I must have misheard.
She's just a random girl.

32:26.445 --> 32:29.244
You didn't say anything to someone
you shouldn't have?

32:29.364 --> 32:31.241
What? No.

32:31.408 --> 32:33.035
Never.

32:34.286 --> 32:37.506
Hey, look, I gotta run.
You have a great night.

32:51.887 --> 32:55.232
I called Michael. He's flying in.
Mia warned me Oscar had reach

32:55.348 --> 32:58.898
into the police. My goal, make sure
this gets into the right hands.

32:59.019 --> 33:00.487
There's more.

33:00.645 --> 33:03.194
That's the mike I wore
when I went to see the ME.

33:03.315 --> 33:05.659
- When you what?
- Before he passed out drunk

33:05.775 --> 33:07.994
the ME admitted
he covered up Mia's murder.

33:08.111 --> 33:11.160
He also acts nostalgic
about another one of Oscar's girls.

33:11.281 --> 33:15.707
Someone back when he was cutting
his baby teeth in the coroner's office.

33:16.119 --> 33:19.168
- Olivia.
- Olivia?

33:23.752 --> 33:27.473
I knew Olivia was ambitious,
but I never thought she'd go that far.

33:31.301 --> 33:34.271
Olivia knew Oscar had the ME
in his back pocket.

33:34.971 --> 33:38.225
That would've been a huge bomb
to drop at the groundbreaking.

33:38.350 --> 33:41.479
Kyle, if your voice is on here,
we'd be outing you to Oscar.

33:42.187 --> 33:44.110
That's why I edited myself out.

33:48.860 --> 33:51.409
Olivia used to be one of Oscar's girls.

33:52.447 --> 33:54.916
He had no problem killing Mia.

33:55.075 --> 33:57.419
Clearly,
Oscar could've killed Olivia too.

34:00.747 --> 34:03.717
I've got parties I could be at.
What's so important?

34:03.833 --> 34:05.927
Chase Vincent's out of jail.

34:06.044 --> 34:08.922
Police are working
on rebuilding their case against him

34:09.047 --> 34:10.799
which means new digging.

34:11.800 --> 34:15.771
- Think they might find out about us?
- Olivia was blackmailing both of us.

34:15.887 --> 34:20.266
The police will be double-checking
every napkin she ever scribbled on.

34:21.101 --> 34:24.731
I don't even have an alibi
for the night she died. Do you?

34:26.606 --> 34:28.904
No. I don't.

34:29.650 --> 34:32.245
Well,
maybe we can help each other out.

34:32.362 --> 34:34.456
I could be your alibi,
you can be mine.

34:35.739 --> 34:37.286
Cool.

34:42.289 --> 34:44.632
We'll figure out the details tomorrow.

34:45.166 --> 34:46.668
Have fun.

34:54.592 --> 34:57.517
- I didn't realise you were here.
- I was in the shower.

34:57.637 --> 34:59.184
- Did you just get in?
- Yeah.

34:59.264 --> 35:01.312
Yeah. I'm gonna jump in the shower.

35:01.474 --> 35:03.852
Then we can celebrate that win.

35:24.247 --> 35:26.716
- Who's bugging you so late?
- It's always work.

35:29.044 --> 35:31.138
Sorry. Gotta go.

35:46.019 --> 35:47.942
Oh, staying late.

35:48.021 --> 35:50.945
Right, you and Derek broke up.
You have no place to go.

35:51.608 --> 35:55.658
I'm right where I wanna be. Shouldn't
you be celebrating with Terrence?

35:55.779 --> 35:57.656
Don't worry. We will be.

35:57.781 --> 36:01.456
For a minute, thought someone
might have you putting in extra hours.

36:01.576 --> 36:04.876
One good routine
doesn't make you a choreographer.

36:04.996 --> 36:06.919
Though it makes you
a megalomaniac.

36:07.332 --> 36:08.925
The crowd loved the routine.

36:09.084 --> 36:10.882
And the girls love dancing it.

36:11.044 --> 36:13.422
There's a whole lot more
where that came from.

36:13.546 --> 36:15.674
I have a book of ideas
on my mom's desk.

36:17.384 --> 36:20.854
Do you want a new box
of crayons or do you have some left?

36:21.012 --> 36:22.434
Deep down, I always thought

36:22.597 --> 36:25.567
I could never do
what Jelena Howard does.

36:25.725 --> 36:28.399
I'm not so sure
I believe that anymore.

36:42.450 --> 36:45.249
Hey. What you got for me?

36:45.370 --> 36:47.998
I'm about to take your career
to a whole new level.

36:49.582 --> 36:51.584
There's trouble in Devils' paradise.

37:05.181 --> 37:08.310
Sloane. I'm glad you're still here.

37:08.476 --> 37:11.946
Do you have a minute? I wanted
to talk to you about something.

37:13.148 --> 37:15.617
Actually, I was just on my way out.

37:24.784 --> 37:26.786
What can I help you with?

37:26.953 --> 37:29.832
Do you happen to know
where Kyle went after the game?

37:30.081 --> 37:33.005
I do. She went celebrating
with some of the girls.

37:33.168 --> 37:36.172
- Why?
- No reason.

37:36.421 --> 37:38.515
It's been so crazy
gearing up for finals.

37:38.631 --> 37:43.262
Speaking of, I have some questions
about the upcoming performances.

38:37.732 --> 38:39.359
<i>Next time on Hit The Floor:</i>

38:41.778 --> 38:45.578
- Where is it?
- Evidence against Oscar? Need that?

38:45.740 --> 38:47.458
If someone was making trouble

38:47.617 --> 38:49.836
I might have to make trouble
for them back.

38:49.994 --> 38:54.170
When this is over, I'm gonna put
my fist through the back of your head.

38:54.499 --> 38:57.173
Derek! If you take away my alibi,
I'm underwater.

38:57.544 --> 38:58.887
Drown, bitch.

38:59.045 --> 39:02.299
I never had a chance.
You haunted us like a ghost.

39:02.423 --> 39:05.802
You're a deluded actress
who's convinced this role is hers.
