WEBVTT

00:05.195 --> 00:08.442
There's several people here
who don't know they're dead.

00:08.443 --> 00:10.032
We've been hearing noises.

00:10.033 --> 00:10.913
Bang!

00:10.914 --> 00:12.492
How many people died?

00:12.493 --> 00:13.566
27.

00:13.567 --> 00:14.715
Something grabbed my leg.

00:14.716 --> 00:16.859
She wants to be really close to you.

00:16.860 --> 00:18.336
I don't like to stay here alone.

00:18.337 --> 00:19.900
A young girl died in the house.

00:19.901 --> 00:21.408
Where is she?

00:21.409 --> 00:23.017
She was fully engulfed in flames.

00:23.018 --> 00:25.009
And it hurts. It hurts so bad.

00:25.010 --> 00:26.057
It's a horrible death.

00:26.058 --> 00:27.647
There was something in that house.

00:27.648 --> 00:31.090
They're like, ugh! They're being watched.

00:31.091 --> 00:35.531
They hate people who sleep in that room.

00:36.980 --> 00:38.925
There's something down there.

00:38.926 --> 00:42.046
My name is Amy Allan.

00:42.898 --> 00:45.117
A lot of dead people are here.

00:45.118 --> 00:46.324
I see dead people.

00:46.325 --> 00:48.057
This is not good.

00:48.058 --> 00:50.089
I speak to dead people.

00:50.090 --> 00:51.713
He is very pissed off.

00:51.714 --> 00:53.249
And they speak to me.

00:53.250 --> 00:54.607
The house is angry.

00:54.608 --> 00:58.051
But there's only one way to
know if my findings are real.

00:58.052 --> 00:59.958
He's killed people.

00:59.959 --> 01:01.379
I rely on my partner.

01:01.380 --> 01:02.681
I'm Steve Dischiavi.

01:02.682 --> 01:04.831
I'm a retired New York
City homicide Detective.

01:04.833 --> 01:06.312
He got shot at his house?

01:06.313 --> 01:09.191
And I know every person,
every house has secrets.

01:09.192 --> 01:10.681
Aren't you terrified being here?

01:10.682 --> 01:11.938
It's my job to reveal 'em.

01:11.939 --> 01:14.064
That sounds like something
out of "The Exorcist."

01:14.065 --> 01:16.219
But Steve and I never speak..

01:16.220 --> 01:18.164
We never communicate
during an investigation.

01:18.165 --> 01:19.565
Until the very end.

01:19.566 --> 01:20.834
It's bad.

01:20.835 --> 01:23.003
When we uncover if it's
safe for you to stay..

01:25.000 --> 01:31.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:48.344 --> 01:51.915
Amy and I work independently
of one another.

01:51.916 --> 01:53.963
I gather evidence, interview witnesses,

01:53.964 --> 01:56.966
and sort through the
history of each location.

01:56.967 --> 02:01.720
At the end, we come together
to compare our findings.

02:01.721 --> 02:04.622
I'm in a small town called
Blackshear in Georgia,

02:04.623 --> 02:07.699
just a couple hours outside of Savannah.

02:07.700 --> 02:09.598
I'm heading over to meet
a woman named Carol

02:09.600 --> 02:13.336
who says she's got some really
disturbing things going on in her home.

02:13.337 --> 02:14.880
Carol and her husband
Robert have lived there

02:14.881 --> 02:19.813
just over six years, and she and
her three kids are terrified.

02:19.814 --> 02:24.194
She said she desperately needs our help.

02:32.263 --> 02:35.099
Before Amy enters a location, I
have to clear the area of anything

02:35.100 --> 02:39.674
that could be leading information, so
it's important that all the family photos

02:39.675 --> 02:44.835
are covered or removed
before Amy begins her walk.

02:52.027 --> 02:56.908
As I approach a new location, I enter
a meditative state I call opening.

02:56.909 --> 03:01.919
This allows me to receive information
from the dead, sometimes way before

03:01.920 --> 03:05.880
I actually arrive at the location.

03:27.082 --> 03:30.862
I have some dead girl with me.

03:31.587 --> 03:35.831
Last night, uh, she kept
trying to creep in my bed.

03:35.832 --> 03:40.143
The dead usually know I'm coming before
I do, and sometimes they appear to me

03:40.144 --> 03:45.299
days before I arrive at a
location, like this girl did.

03:45.300 --> 03:48.660
She's very scary looking.

03:48.915 --> 03:51.855
And she's extremely

03:52.893 --> 03:56.253
emotional, and very angry.

03:59.180 --> 04:05.080
Nobody's listening to her, and she's
really (Bleep) Pissed about it.

04:20.546 --> 04:23.032
Well, Carol, thanks for inviting
me to your home. It's beautiful.

04:23.033 --> 04:25.151
Thank you for coming.

04:25.152 --> 04:28.158
- What's going on?
- When we moved here,

04:28.159 --> 04:29.975
we started having some incidents

04:29.976 --> 04:34.176
that we really just couldn't explain.

04:34.644 --> 04:38.124
We've been hearing noises..

04:38.547 --> 04:44.447
Um, having things being knocked
off the tables and the walls.

04:45.354 --> 04:46.619
My older sons..

04:46.620 --> 04:49.203
They won't even stay here by
themselves if we're out of town.

04:49.204 --> 04:51.964
- Really?
- Yeah.

04:53.409 --> 04:56.200
Well, Carol, did the previous
homeowner say anything to you?

04:56.201 --> 05:02.101
No, um, as a matter of fact, he sold
us the house with everything in it,

05:02.239 --> 05:05.419
all of his possessions.

05:05.613 --> 05:09.513
He probably left 500 Angels here.

05:09.635 --> 05:11.287
Every room of the house,
even the bathrooms,

05:11.288 --> 05:15.608
there were Angels everywhere you looked.

05:16.663 --> 05:21.632
If you're gonna collect
something, why leave it?

05:21.633 --> 05:22.828
I mean, it's a beautiful home.

05:22.829 --> 05:24.343
Yeah, it is a very
beautiful home.

05:24.344 --> 05:28.086
Um, but it has some secrets, and I need
to find out what those secrets are.

05:28.087 --> 05:29.687
Well, that's what we're here for.

05:29.688 --> 05:32.577
Um, is there any place you can show me
in the house where things are happening?

05:32.578 --> 05:34.798
Certainly.

05:44.504 --> 05:46.664
So she..

05:47.896 --> 05:49.481
Is very angry.

05:49.482 --> 05:52.122
She's like 17.

05:52.189 --> 05:54.114
The anger girl is very needy.

05:54.115 --> 05:56.903
She's actually been visiting
me for the past few nights,

05:56.904 --> 05:59.708
and has even tried to crawl into my bed.

05:59.709 --> 06:03.115
When I refused to let her, she
started fighting with me.

06:03.116 --> 06:06.655
She wanted someone to listen to her.

06:06.656 --> 06:10.316
Nobody (Bleep) Listens to her.

06:12.474 --> 06:18.187
I took my dogs out to go to the restroom
one morning, and when I came back, um,

06:18.188 --> 06:23.029
this cabinet door had been
completely ripped off the hinges.

06:23.030 --> 06:27.327
It had not been like that when I left,
and there was no way anyone could have

06:27.328 --> 06:31.283
gotten past me to have come into the
house, there was no one else home.

06:31.284 --> 06:35.784
It really scared the daylights out of me.

06:46.574 --> 06:50.834
I see that she can open the cabinets.

06:57.497 --> 07:00.231
Pretty sure she actually
broke dishes, which is..

07:00.232 --> 07:01.889
After she was dead?

07:01.890 --> 07:03.087
- Uh-huh, yeah.
- Okay.

07:03.088 --> 07:06.208
When she's been dead.

07:07.903 --> 07:09.626
Anything else in this room?

07:09.627 --> 07:12.434
Now we were putting food
in the pantry one day,

07:12.435 --> 07:15.395
uh, and I opened a cabinet,
and a box of sugar

07:15.396 --> 07:17.987
came out with enough force that it went

07:17.988 --> 07:21.505
from one side of the pantry and
hit the door on the other side.

07:21.506 --> 07:25.886
I really wanted to leave at that point.

07:27.916 --> 07:31.116
She takes the dishes, she
throws 'em on the floor.

07:31.117 --> 07:34.917
She's throwing them on the floor.

07:34.918 --> 07:36.146
Taking this.. Fl..

07:36.147 --> 07:39.627
Throwing them on the floor.

07:40.544 --> 07:41.646
Where is she?

07:41.647 --> 07:45.187
Oh, she's right over there.

07:50.506 --> 07:53.317
We have a daughter named Melanie,
who has Down Syndrome,

07:53.318 --> 07:57.441
and she started telling me that
there was a ghost girl in her room.

07:57.442 --> 08:00.141
I said, "what's the name of
the ghost girl in your room?"

08:00.142 --> 08:03.102
And she told me that her name was Pearl.

08:03.103 --> 08:05.673
Carol, how does Melanie know her name?

08:05.674 --> 08:09.689
Because the apparition has told
her that her name is Pearl.

08:09.690 --> 08:12.930
- You're kidding.
- No.

08:14.673 --> 08:17.937
I went to the public library,
and I found a book

08:17.938 --> 08:21.548
called "The History of
Pierce County, Georgia,"

08:21.549 --> 08:26.268
and it just so happens
that there is a photo..

08:26.269 --> 08:28.789
Of our house.

08:29.342 --> 08:31.552
- Okay.
- And a picture of..

08:31.553 --> 08:33.592
The family who built the house,

08:33.594 --> 08:36.953
and that is Pearl Taylor.

08:39.462 --> 08:41.597
Do you know how Pearl died?

08:41.599 --> 08:44.620
I know that Pearl burned in the house.

08:44.621 --> 08:47.730
I don't know how, or when,
or anything in particular,

08:47.731 --> 08:52.471
but I do know that Pearl died in the house.

08:52.632 --> 08:55.437
Has anything bad happened to Melanie?

08:55.438 --> 09:00.980
Some girls from across the street came
over to watch television with her, and..

09:00.981 --> 09:03.666
They said they couldn't find
her, she wasn't in her room.

09:03.667 --> 09:06.673
And when we went up to look for her, she
was in the closet with the door shut.

09:06.674 --> 09:09.979
Which is very, very unlike her.

09:09.980 --> 09:11.747
And, uh, when she came out of the closet,

09:11.748 --> 09:13.647
we asked her, "what were
you doing in there?"

09:13.648 --> 09:19.548
And she said Pearl was bugging her
again, asking her to find her a dress.

09:20.317 --> 09:24.618
Our concern is, if she can get
Melanie to go into a closet,

09:24.619 --> 09:29.622
she might, could get Melanie to
go out the window onto the roof.

09:29.623 --> 09:35.103
She might, could get Melanie to go
out the front door into the street.

09:35.104 --> 09:38.917
I don't know what extent this
apparition, or this ghost,

09:38.918 --> 09:44.818
is gonna have influence on my child, and..
And that concerns me.

09:47.082 --> 09:52.982
When you're entering, like, you
know, the first level of sleep,

09:53.969 --> 09:57.533
and she wants to be really close to you,

09:57.534 --> 10:03.202
and she'll, like, put her face right
in your face, and, like, move.

10:03.203 --> 10:06.503
She likes to be able to

10:06.925 --> 10:08.535
make you see her then..

10:08.536 --> 10:09.340
Okay.

10:09.341 --> 10:12.461
And talk to you then.

10:25.773 --> 10:29.175
In my experience, kids make
up stories for their parents,

10:29.176 --> 10:33.027
but the truth comes out when a
stranger is asking the questions.

10:33.028 --> 10:36.492
That's why I need to speak
with Melanie alone.

10:36.493 --> 10:38.040
Melanie, I was talking to Mom,

10:38.041 --> 10:40.502
and, uh, she said that you
see a ghost in your room?

10:40.503 --> 10:42.223
- Yes.
- Okay.

10:42.224 --> 10:44.453
Do you see the ghost in the closet?

10:44.454 --> 10:46.438
Uh, yes.

10:46.439 --> 10:48.267
Okay. Do you know her name?

10:48.268 --> 10:49.950
Yeah, her name's Pearl.

10:49.951 --> 10:51.463
- Pearl.
- Yes.

10:51.464 --> 10:54.191
Okay. Does she talk to you?

10:54.192 --> 10:55.176
Yeah.

10:55.177 --> 10:57.356
Okay, what kind of things does she ask you?

10:57.357 --> 11:00.417
(Speaking indistinctly)

11:01.499 --> 11:03.361
Find her a dress.

11:03.362 --> 11:05.357
So she wants you to help
her find her dress?

11:05.358 --> 11:06.598
Yes.

11:06.599 --> 11:09.004
If I showed you the picture,
can you point her out to me?

11:09.005 --> 11:09.902
Yes.

11:09.903 --> 11:11.219
Okay.

11:11.220 --> 11:14.640
Show me who the ghost is.

11:37.604 --> 11:39.464
Um..

11:43.772 --> 11:45.632
Boy!

11:50.531 --> 11:53.771
There are kids up here.

11:57.025 --> 12:01.741
And they're laughing, they're running,
but there's something else here.

12:01.742 --> 12:04.862
They're being watched.

12:10.977 --> 12:12.959
Robert, I spoke with uh, your wife Carol.

12:12.960 --> 12:15.230
She told me about the things
going on in the house.

12:15.231 --> 12:18.642
Have you ever seen anything, or
heard anything you can't explain?

12:18.643 --> 12:19.794
Oh, absolutely.

12:19.795 --> 12:22.643
In this room here, uh,
my wife and I have had

12:22.644 --> 12:26.309
conversations about whether I
believe or not, and I said..

12:26.310 --> 12:28.975
"Until the ghost shows up,
taps me on the shoulder."

12:28.976 --> 12:32.984
"and says, here I am, I'm
your ghost, accept me."

12:32.985 --> 12:34.646
I said, then I'll believe.

12:34.647 --> 12:38.478
And about.. It wasn't 15 minutes
later, something grabbed my leg.

12:38.479 --> 12:42.229
And I turned around, I said,
all right, Carol, cut it out.

12:42.230 --> 12:43.366
I said, I'm trying to go to sleep.

12:43.367 --> 12:45.552
She goes, what are you talking about?
I said, you just grabbed my leg.

12:45.553 --> 12:49.933
And she goes, I didn't touch your leg.

12:51.215 --> 12:52.259
Anything else?

12:52.260 --> 12:56.320
My wife and myself and Melanie
were downstairs having dinner,

12:56.321 --> 12:58.399
you could hear someone
stomping like they were mad,

12:58.400 --> 13:01.932
and bam, bam, bam, doors slamming.

13:01.933 --> 13:07.213
- And nobody was up here?
- No, nobody was up here.

13:11.930 --> 13:14.363
There's two men.

13:14.364 --> 13:18.384
They do things to the people here.

13:19.329 --> 13:21.051
Like what?

13:21.052 --> 13:22.972
Bang.

13:23.308 --> 13:24.226
Bang!

13:24.227 --> 13:26.567
Like, bang!

13:26.598 --> 13:29.037
And it, like, shakes the whole room.

13:29.038 --> 13:31.798
Bang, bang, bang!

13:35.241 --> 13:39.681
They hate people who sleep in that room.

13:48.123 --> 13:50.154
What have you experienced in this room?

13:50.155 --> 13:52.323
When I go to bed, I lay
my phone and my glasses

13:52.324 --> 13:56.869
on my nightstand over there, and several
times, after discussions with my wife

13:56.870 --> 14:01.232
about paranormal activity, and where
I stand as far as my beliefs,

14:01.233 --> 14:05.275
I've heard it slide across the
nightstand and hit the floor.

14:05.276 --> 14:07.919
So it's as if you're
mocking it, so to speak.

14:07.920 --> 14:10.853
That's exactly how it makes me
feel, and that's the thing..

14:10.854 --> 14:12.720
That's why I don't like to
talk about it in the house,

14:12.721 --> 14:15.773
because every time I do, something happens.

14:15.774 --> 14:17.949
Have you heard any other
noises or anything else?

14:17.950 --> 14:22.590
We've heard, uh, doors slamming,
constant footsteps, constant footsteps,

14:22.591 --> 14:26.830
uh, crashes in the middle of the
night that are unexplained.

14:26.831 --> 14:28.653
I mean, we'll come down, and
we'll look for something, maybe

14:28.654 --> 14:31.173
a picture fell, maybe
the garbage fell over,

14:31.174 --> 14:35.914
anything.. Nothing.
Can't ever find anything.

14:38.735 --> 14:40.895
I knew..

14:41.055 --> 14:43.035
That..

14:43.305 --> 14:46.500
There was issues in this room.

14:46.501 --> 14:48.781
And that..

14:49.142 --> 14:52.742
It was coming from up above.

14:55.537 --> 14:59.241
It's these two men that are up there.

14:59.242 --> 15:01.809
They jump up, and then they slam.

15:01.810 --> 15:03.798
They're, like, ugh!

15:03.799 --> 15:06.797
And it shakes this whole..

15:06.798 --> 15:10.473
Shaking the walls, shaking the floor.

15:10.474 --> 15:12.754
Everything.

15:23.240 --> 15:24.561
Jim, I was talking to your Mom.

15:24.562 --> 15:27.217
She explained some of the things
that are going on in the house,

15:27.218 --> 15:29.610
and that you've had quite
a few things happen.

15:29.611 --> 15:31.737
Why don't you explain
to me what's going on?

15:31.738 --> 15:34.158
Every night, something new.

15:34.159 --> 15:39.339
Doors slamming downstairs, uh,
my closet door opening, closing.

15:39.340 --> 15:42.773
- This closet right here?
- Yeah, that closet.

15:42.774 --> 15:46.394
When the closet door opens up,
you've seen it actually open?

15:46.395 --> 15:47.676
Oh, yes.

15:47.677 --> 15:49.273
How often does it happen?

15:49.274 --> 15:51.649
About every day.

15:51.650 --> 15:54.753
Is it to the point that you're
afraid to actually live here?

15:54.754 --> 15:57.686
I don't like to stay here alone, at all.

15:57.687 --> 15:59.734
Did you ever believe in this
stuff before you moved here?

15:59.735 --> 16:01.144
No, absolutely not.

16:01.145 --> 16:02.254
How about now?

16:02.255 --> 16:04.955
Oh, yeah, I am.

16:09.658 --> 16:14.495
There's also a little kid
messing with the door.

16:14.496 --> 16:15.962
5, maybe.

16:15.963 --> 16:17.703
5.

16:21.783 --> 16:24.845
- Doing what?
- Trying to practice, like..

16:24.846 --> 16:28.572
Turning the knob and opening it..

16:28.573 --> 16:32.741
Learning how to open and
close the door, basically.

16:32.742 --> 16:35.338
This child thinks this is great.

16:35.339 --> 16:37.600
It's like the best thing in the world.

16:37.601 --> 16:43.121
And this door is the one the
angry girl comes through.

16:50.647 --> 16:52.845
So there's a lot of girls here.

16:52.846 --> 16:54.823
Teenager girls.

16:54.824 --> 16:55.785
Together?

16:55.786 --> 16:57.646
Yes.

17:02.897 --> 17:06.333
They're like, dressed conservatively.

17:06.334 --> 17:10.174
The style looks like 1880, 1890.

17:13.961 --> 17:15.881
But..

17:16.174 --> 17:20.134
There's a lot of stuff going on.

17:27.194 --> 17:30.071
There were a lot of crazy things
going on in Carol's house.

17:30.072 --> 17:32.727
What I need to know is why
did this previous homeowner

17:32.728 --> 17:37.686
run out of there like his house was on
fire and leave all his belongings behind.

17:37.687 --> 17:41.210
The guy refuses to take my calls
and talk to me about the house.

17:41.211 --> 17:42.565
He's clearly spooked.

17:42.566 --> 17:44.952
So I'm going to talk to Carol's
neighbor, who knew the guy,

17:44.953 --> 17:49.333
and see what he can tell me about him.

17:53.977 --> 17:55.655
How long have you been living here?

17:55.656 --> 17:58.639
Been living in this house on
and off for the past 15 years.

17:58.640 --> 18:00.917
Okay, so did you know
the previous homeowner?

18:00.918 --> 18:04.866
The owner's daughter was a
very good friend of mine,

18:04.867 --> 18:09.758
and I spent nearly every single day in the
house until we graduated high school.

18:09.759 --> 18:11.922
I heard that the house
was filled with Angels.

18:11.923 --> 18:14.683
Angels everywhere.

18:18.724 --> 18:23.581
I think he did it to protect himself
from whatever was in the house.

18:23.582 --> 18:25.696
You think he was the
type of guy that just..

18:25.697 --> 18:26.698
Run out like that?

18:26.699 --> 18:29.580
I don't believe that he would've
tore out as quickly as possible,

18:29.581 --> 18:35.481
unless there was something in that
house that scared him to that point.

18:37.411 --> 18:39.853
I need to start looking
into the house's past.

18:39.854 --> 18:41.274
Carol gave me the first clue

18:41.275 --> 18:44.133
with the story about the teenage
girl who burnt to death.

18:44.134 --> 18:50.014
If it's true, the local Fire
Chief will know all about it.

18:57.395 --> 19:02.912
On Saturday August 27, 1910, the
16-year-old daughter of George Taylor,

19:02.913 --> 19:06.025
Pearl Taylor, was, um,
involved in an incident

19:06.026 --> 19:08.306
where she was trying to
place a kerosene lantern

19:08.307 --> 19:12.496
onto the mantel of the fireplace,
when it dropped and exploded,

19:12.497 --> 19:15.231
and caught her on fire.

19:15.232 --> 19:16.354
Did she die immediately?

19:16.355 --> 19:20.306
She actually survived until the next
morning, on Sunday, December the 28th.

19:20.307 --> 19:22.498
You have to understand
that third degree burns

19:22.499 --> 19:25.948
actually burn the complete skin layers off.

19:25.949 --> 19:29.016
She wouldn't have been recognizable.

19:29.017 --> 19:32.317
That's a horrible death.

19:33.399 --> 19:38.319
She died at night, and
she looks really weird.

19:40.930 --> 19:42.368
Her body is all beat up.

19:42.369 --> 19:45.054
It's all broken, and it hurts.
It hurts so bad.

19:45.055 --> 19:47.915
It hurts so (Bleep) Bad.

19:47.916 --> 19:50.059
This walk is so punishing.

19:50.060 --> 19:53.194
I'm absorbing this girl's
emotional and physical pain.

19:53.195 --> 19:55.758
I really want to help her
move on, but I can't.

19:55.759 --> 19:59.299
She's too angry to let go.

19:59.825 --> 20:01.401
Dark, dark, dark.

20:01.402 --> 20:04.702
It hurts so (Bleep) Bad.

20:07.213 --> 20:09.330
Now that I know Pearl
actually died in that house,

20:09.331 --> 20:13.703
I need to find out more about the family.

20:13.704 --> 20:15.851
So I've tracked down one
of Pearl's descendants,

20:15.852 --> 20:17.553
who actually still lives in the town,

20:17.554 --> 20:22.414
to see if we can fill
in the missing pieces.

20:25.976 --> 20:28.070
I understand you're
related to Pearl Taylor.

20:28.071 --> 20:30.194
That's right. She was my great Aunt.

20:30.195 --> 20:35.113
Now I've learned that she
was killed in 1910 by fire,

20:35.114 --> 20:37.840
but I don't know really much
about the family or her.

20:37.841 --> 20:40.148
Uh, I was wondering if you
could fill that in for me.

20:40.149 --> 20:42.752
Pearl was, uh, 16 years old.

20:42.753 --> 20:45.226
The next day, she was
about to go to college.

20:45.227 --> 20:49.718
And back then, 16 years old was
very unusual for a person,

20:49.719 --> 20:52.360
much less a woman, to go to college.

20:52.361 --> 20:53.382
Oh, so she was gifted?

20:53.383 --> 20:54.567
Yes, she was.

20:54.568 --> 20:56.291
Obviously we know how bad it was for Pearl,

20:56.292 --> 20:57.638
but what about the rest of the family?

20:57.639 --> 20:59.708
If your child died burning,
and you sat there

20:59.709 --> 21:02.075
for six straight hours and
watched 'em in pain and death,

21:02.076 --> 21:06.456
I mean, could you ever recover from it?

21:07.352 --> 21:08.988
There's another man.

21:08.989 --> 21:11.329
He's tall.

21:12.589 --> 21:15.649
He's wearing a suit.

21:17.652 --> 21:19.566
He.. He.. He's confused.

21:19.567 --> 21:23.467
So.. It's hard for him to talk.

21:24.433 --> 21:26.810
What am I doing here?

21:26.811 --> 21:29.082
He says he's carrying all this pain.

21:29.083 --> 21:30.224
Why are you whispering?

21:30.225 --> 21:33.705
I don't want him to know.

21:33.817 --> 21:36.397
He's confused.

21:48.951 --> 21:50.536
There's another man.

21:50.537 --> 21:52.877
He's tall.

21:54.171 --> 21:57.231
He's wearing a suit.

22:01.940 --> 22:04.340
Oh, my God.

22:06.331 --> 22:10.531
He says he's carrying all this pain.

22:12.516 --> 22:16.425
Usually when people don't know they're
dead, it means one of two things..

22:16.426 --> 22:18.727
Either they suffered a
sudden and traumatic death,

22:18.728 --> 22:22.229
or they refuse to acknowledge
what happened to them.

22:22.230 --> 22:25.110
He's looking for..

22:26.353 --> 22:28.582
Oh, that's his wife.

22:28.583 --> 22:31.088
When was this?

22:31.089 --> 22:34.569
Man, I want to say, like..

22:35.757 --> 22:37.677
1901.

22:37.945 --> 22:42.625
I'm seeing lots of little babies that died.

22:43.291 --> 22:47.625
I mean, I couldn't even imagine losing a
child, especially in that manner, but..

22:47.626 --> 22:50.184
Yeah, terrible any type
of situation, but then,

22:50.185 --> 22:52.667
you have to understand, too,
they had lost a child earlier.

22:52.668 --> 22:53.826
Oh, jeez.

22:53.827 --> 22:55.311
Now I know his name was George.

22:55.312 --> 22:56.866
So they lose two kids.

22:56.867 --> 22:58.535
Correct.

22:58.536 --> 23:01.146
When you grew up and you visited the house,

23:01.147 --> 23:04.378
uh, did anything strange
happen when you were there?

23:04.379 --> 23:05.617
Yes.

23:05.618 --> 23:08.151
Pearl has some trunks
with her clothes in them,

23:08.152 --> 23:11.043
and the next day, she was
about to go to college.

23:11.044 --> 23:14.490
Grandma Taylor would not let
anybody open those trunks,

23:14.491 --> 23:17.088
and they were in a closet upstairs.

23:17.089 --> 23:21.874
And then when my Grandmother, well, she
kind of abided by her Mother's wishes

23:21.875 --> 23:23.222
never to open it, so we never opened it.

23:23.223 --> 23:26.445
Then in 1981, after my grandfather's death,

23:26.446 --> 23:30.034
my father and Mother and me,
some other family members,

23:30.035 --> 23:35.635
went up there and pulled the two
trunks out, and we opened the trunks,

23:35.636 --> 23:38.523
and right when I popped open
the trunk, all of a sudden,

23:38.524 --> 23:44.424
just out of nowhere, a lightning
bolt, thunder, just came out, boom.

23:55.122 --> 23:57.282
So she..

23:58.996 --> 24:01.576
Is very angry.

24:04.887 --> 24:07.927
It's really weird, because
she's dressed like,

24:07.928 --> 24:10.424
I'd almost say, like,
like, some kind of, like,

24:10.425 --> 24:12.975
schoolgirls, or something like this.

24:12.976 --> 24:16.616
Something about school with her,
something about school around her.

24:16.617 --> 24:21.720
I see her, like, studying and learning,
with books around her and a table here.

24:21.721 --> 24:23.014
And I was like, "what's your name?"

24:23.015 --> 24:28.915
And that kind of set her off,
because she couldn't remember.

24:31.779 --> 24:33.839
I need to search through
the library's archives

24:33.840 --> 24:39.740
to see if anything happened on the
property before Pearl's death.

24:46.628 --> 24:52.008
Turns out, in the 1880s, Pearl's
father owned 41 acres of land there.

24:52.009 --> 24:55.660
Also turns out, one of the worst
rail road crashes in U.S. history

24:55.661 --> 24:59.501
happened right near his property.

25:22.615 --> 25:26.563
I'm conducting an investigation in
Blackshear, and during my research,

25:26.564 --> 25:28.340
I came across an article
about a train wreck

25:28.341 --> 25:31.317
that happened in 1888, uh, which
looked like it wasn't too far

25:31.318 --> 25:33.960
from the property I'm investigating.

25:33.961 --> 25:35.864
Do you know about this train wreck?

25:35.865 --> 25:39.784
It's.. It's considered probably one of
the worst train disasters in the state.

25:39.785 --> 25:41.245
It was a lot of chaos.

25:41.246 --> 25:42.699
About how many people died?

25:42.700 --> 25:44.500
27.

25:45.519 --> 25:48.200
There's a lot of other
people that are upstairs,

25:48.201 --> 25:50.290
and they're like, "oh, (Bleep),
what are we gonna do?"

25:50.291 --> 25:54.166
"What are we gonna do?" Lots of 'em died.

25:54.167 --> 25:56.927
Ribs were broken.

25:57.224 --> 25:59.148
Internal organs were smushed.

25:59.149 --> 26:01.969
They were crushed.

26:02.865 --> 26:05.188
What kind of injuries are we
talking about with this wreck?

26:05.189 --> 26:11.089
You're talking about a scene of bodies,
just piled on top of each other.

26:11.356 --> 26:12.691
Metal piled upon people.

26:12.692 --> 26:14.775
People who are just trapped, suffering.

26:14.776 --> 26:16.314
There's cars that are on fire.

26:16.315 --> 26:19.320
There's no easy way to die
in a crash like that.

26:19.321 --> 26:22.750
Did they set up a triage center,
like, right on the road?

26:22.751 --> 26:27.561
Very very.. Crude, uh, makeshift,
uh, triage center they had there.

26:27.562 --> 26:30.611
The guy that I'm investigating
owned 41 acres.

26:30.612 --> 26:35.974
Looks like the property would've been
probably on or near this train track.

26:35.975 --> 26:37.361
Yes, I think it's possible.

26:37.362 --> 26:40.362
It's possible. Okay.

26:49.428 --> 26:52.337
During my walk, I
encountered many entities,

26:52.338 --> 26:55.917
but the suicidal man was in terrible grief.

26:55.918 --> 26:59.278
So I'm meeting with a sketch artist
to try and put a face to him.

26:59.279 --> 27:01.739
He was tall,

27:02.078 --> 27:06.878
and probably between the
ages of 40 and 50..

27:08.903 --> 27:10.823
And..

27:11.382 --> 27:15.042
He has a very thick mustache.

27:19.738 --> 27:23.828
What would you describe the lower
part of his nose as being..

27:23.829 --> 27:27.009
- Square.
- Turned up..

27:27.970 --> 27:30.110
Any kind of aging under his eyes?

27:30.111 --> 27:35.451
He has very, very deep
crow's feet, like very deep.

27:37.643 --> 27:43.543
Oh, um, Amy, you think this, uh, bears
resemblance to the person you saw?

27:48.459 --> 27:50.979
Yes, it does.

28:19.127 --> 28:22.008
After completing each of our
investigations separately,

28:22.009 --> 28:27.046
Amy and I will be revealing our
findings together for the first time.

28:27.047 --> 28:28.715
They've been living here about seven years.

28:28.716 --> 28:32.746
Uh, they've got some pretty bizarre
things happening in the house.

28:32.747 --> 28:37.620
Uh, one of the big issues, uh, is they
have a daughter with special needs

28:37.621 --> 28:40.051
that seems to be getting targeted.

28:40.052 --> 28:42.350
Uh, with that, I'm gonna
turn it over to Amy and,

28:42.351 --> 28:44.581
she can tell us what she found on her walk.

28:44.582 --> 28:50.482
The first thing that I encountered
was, uh, two men, um, in the attic,

28:51.821 --> 28:57.265
and what they like to do is jump up
really high through the ceiling,

28:57.266 --> 29:00.566
and then drop themselves.

29:00.665 --> 29:04.421
and it just makes a loud
noise, and it'll shake,

29:04.422 --> 29:08.039
uh, the house when they do it.

29:08.040 --> 29:09.793
Hmm.

29:09.794 --> 29:10.858
Like, boom.

29:10.859 --> 29:14.099
Bang! And it, like, shakes the whole room.

29:14.100 --> 29:16.860
Bang, bang, bang!

29:20.349 --> 29:24.789
They hate people who sleep in that room.

29:29.966 --> 29:31.182
Why don't you explain to Amy

29:31.183 --> 29:33.417
some of the noises you've
been hearing in the house.

29:33.418 --> 29:35.822
We always say it sounds
like doors are slamming,

29:35.823 --> 29:39.248
uh, just loud bangs and pops and footsteps.

29:39.249 --> 29:43.088
Uh, every night when I go to bed, I put
my cell phone next to my nightstand,

29:43.089 --> 29:46.120
and several times, my
cell phone and my glasses

29:46.121 --> 29:48.360
have went sliding off that nightstand.

29:48.361 --> 29:50.690
They didn't just fall off,
I didn't misplace them,

29:50.691 --> 29:52.936
because they were halfway across the room.

29:52.937 --> 29:56.002
What exactly are they doing..
These two guys?

29:56.003 --> 30:01.903
They're all about revenge and
disruption against the original owner,

30:02.247 --> 30:07.767
who apparently they don't
understand is no longer here.

30:08.160 --> 30:11.879
We've had multiple pictures
come off the wall.

30:11.880 --> 30:17.780
We've also had light bulbs pop like
popcorn, just, pop, pop, pop, everywhere,

30:17.860 --> 30:20.940
so we've had a lot of
activity since your walk.

30:20.941 --> 30:26.023
Mm-hmm, it.. Activity will increase
before or after the walk takes place.

30:26.024 --> 30:29.924
Um, everybody just gets riled up.

30:38.936 --> 30:40.514
So, Amy, what else did you encounter?

30:40.515 --> 30:45.624
The second thing was, I was at
the lower end of the stairwell,

30:45.625 --> 30:50.772
and, um, I had a hard time,
because there were so many people

30:50.773 --> 30:56.673
that wanted to communicate, I had
to argue with them to line up.

30:58.514 --> 31:04.414
But there's several people here
who don't know they're dead.

31:04.881 --> 31:07.724
There's a lot of other
people that are upstairs

31:07.725 --> 31:09.899
that I don't necessarily
want to talk to yet,

31:09.900 --> 31:12.650
so I'm gonna see if I can
find somebody else down here

31:12.651 --> 31:17.446
who can tell me what happened,
because they were crushed.

31:17.447 --> 31:21.076
Back in 1888, there was a train
wreck not far from here.

31:21.077 --> 31:26.777
Probably one of the biggest
train wrecks in U.S. history.

31:28.964 --> 31:31.198
There was kids, there was
women, there was men dead.

31:31.199 --> 31:32.131
Oh, wow.

31:32.132 --> 31:34.090
That's a lot of people
that died at one time,

31:34.091 --> 31:36.871
so I didn't know if that had anything
to do with what, maybe you saw.

31:36.872 --> 31:38.998
Could be from the train accident,

31:38.999 --> 31:44.279
because I don't understand
what they're doing here.

31:51.238 --> 31:52.847
Is there anything else you encountered?

31:52.848 --> 31:58.748
The next one was interesting, because
I met her before I did the walk.

32:00.292 --> 32:03.358
She was in the car with
me on the drive to here,

32:03.359 --> 32:08.572
and has been trying to reach
out for quite some time.

32:08.573 --> 32:10.847
And she doesn't feel
like she's being heard.

32:10.848 --> 32:13.539
That's why she's been acting out.

32:13.540 --> 32:17.860
She opens and closes the cabinet doors.

32:18.007 --> 32:21.413
She didn't understand how she died.

32:21.414 --> 32:25.257
It was a quick, fast, traumatic thing.

32:25.258 --> 32:31.158
I know she has long hair, uh, brown,
she's all gray, like, grays.

32:32.007 --> 32:35.306
She really wants to talk.

32:35.307 --> 32:37.454
Carol, you're visually upset.
What's going on?

32:37.455 --> 32:42.495
Amy just described exactly
what my daughter sees.

32:46.390 --> 32:52.218
Carol, why don't you tell Amy about the
stuff that happens in the kitchen.

32:52.219 --> 32:57.397
One morning, I took the dogs
out, and when I came back in,

32:57.398 --> 33:03.298
one of my lower cabinet doors had been
completely ripped off one of its hinges.

33:07.551 --> 33:11.216
We discussed that you had thought there
was a girl that died here in this house.

33:11.217 --> 33:13.137
Yeah.

33:13.231 --> 33:14.823
And it was true.

33:14.824 --> 33:19.841
Um, George Taylor, who built this home in
1905, had a young daughter, 16 years old.

33:19.842 --> 33:22.127
Her name was Pearl.

33:22.128 --> 33:24.940
Pearl burned to death in the house here.

33:24.941 --> 33:27.341
Oh, my God.

33:28.599 --> 33:30.617
She was carrying a kerosene lamp.

33:30.618 --> 33:32.282
Oh, my God.

33:32.283 --> 33:36.435
It somehow fell, and she
burned beyond recognition.

33:36.436 --> 33:39.736
I got a picture of her.

33:41.742 --> 33:43.448
This is Pearl.

33:43.449 --> 33:47.529
She lingered for, like, seven hours.

33:48.356 --> 33:49.593
Oh, my God.

33:49.594 --> 33:51.246
Had to be agony.

33:51.247 --> 33:53.827
You all right?

33:59.863 --> 34:04.123
I'm sorry, I'm very upset right now.

34:05.875 --> 34:08.275
Oh, my God.

34:09.770 --> 34:14.270
I told you, all these years, I told you.

34:17.551 --> 34:22.231
I told you there were ghosts in this house.

34:36.967 --> 34:38.878
Sorry.

34:38.879 --> 34:41.161
- You all right?
- Yeah.

34:41.161 --> 34:44.389
For some reason, I felt compelled
to stay open during the reveal,

34:44.391 --> 34:47.382
so I can communicate more
easily with the dead.

34:47.382 --> 34:51.371
Pearl knew this, so she sat on the
floor beside me the whole time.

34:51.371 --> 34:54.291
Her sadness and grief overwhelmed me.

34:54.292 --> 34:55.998
What just happened?

34:56.000 --> 34:59.148
The girl was under the table.

34:59.149 --> 35:02.269
This.. This girl here?

35:03.047 --> 35:04.907
Yes.

35:06.064 --> 35:10.264
She is very angry and very emotional.

35:10.745 --> 35:14.165
It's a strange place
where she is right now.

35:14.166 --> 35:15.475
She's going back and forth

35:15.476 --> 35:20.996
between knowing she's dead
and not knowing she's dead.

35:23.384 --> 35:25.505
Carol, I think now is
when you should tell Amy

35:25.506 --> 35:28.604
about what's going on with Melanie.

35:28.605 --> 35:31.572
We have a daughter named Melanie,
who has Down Syndrome.

35:31.573 --> 35:37.473
She let us know pretty quickly there was
a ghost girl that came into her room.

35:37.484 --> 35:41.444
When I found a photo in a book..

35:41.610 --> 35:44.031
And asked her to show
me the ghost girl,

35:44.032 --> 35:46.667
she pointed right at Pearl.

35:46.668 --> 35:49.768
And she described her as having brown hair

35:49.769 --> 35:53.868
and a gray face, wearing a white dress.

35:53.869 --> 35:55.729
Wow.

35:57.601 --> 35:59.622
Now because Pearl was
on her way to college,

35:59.623 --> 36:02.645
she had packed a trunk,
uh, to go away with,

36:02.646 --> 36:07.228
and she was actually leaving for college
literally the next day before she died.

36:07.229 --> 36:09.337
- Yeah.
- You know that?

36:09.338 --> 36:13.081
Well, I didn't know that, but I..
I did see her studying.

36:13.082 --> 36:16.332
She's dressed, like, I'd almost say, like,

36:16.333 --> 36:19.623
some kind of, like schoolgirls,
or something like this.

36:19.624 --> 36:25.524
I see her, like, studying and learning,
with books around her, and a table here.

36:27.993 --> 36:32.463
After she died, her Mother's
wishes were that it stayed closed.

36:32.464 --> 36:36.208
So I had talked to a
descendant of the Taylors.

36:36.209 --> 36:40.873
In 1981, after the grandparents had
passed, they decided to open the trunk,

36:40.874 --> 36:43.547
and he said it was just odd,
because there was no mention

36:43.548 --> 36:46.369
of a thunderstorm or anything,
but when they opened the trunk,

36:46.370 --> 36:51.770
lightning and thunder struck
as soon as he opened it.

36:52.764 --> 36:54.792
Could something like opening up that trunk

36:54.793 --> 36:56.372
trigger the activity that
they're having here?

36:56.373 --> 36:58.356
It does make sense with the trunk,

36:58.357 --> 37:03.895
because the family kept it locked up
and everything, they never let go,

37:03.896 --> 37:05.428
and the grieving..

37:05.429 --> 37:09.809
That could inadvertently tether her here.

37:11.347 --> 37:16.927
When they open it years later,
she then is, like, "oh."

37:18.420 --> 37:23.578
That was, like, the best thing they
could have done, actually, for her.

37:23.579 --> 37:25.393
Because three years later,
the house gets sold.

37:25.394 --> 37:27.123
They don't even keep..
They had it in their family

37:27.124 --> 37:29.803
since the turn of the century,
now all of a sudden,

37:29.804 --> 37:31.486
three years later, they sell the house.

37:31.487 --> 37:34.437
Then you had the incident with the
person you bought the house from,

37:34.438 --> 37:36.864
he basically ran out of here
and left all the furniture.

37:36.865 --> 37:39.463
- He literally ran out of the house?
- Left the furniture.

37:39.464 --> 37:41.560
Sheets on the bed, towels in the..

37:41.561 --> 37:43.381
In the kitchen drawer.

37:43.382 --> 37:45.242
Wow.

37:52.572 --> 37:54.186
So, Amy, what else did you encounter?

37:54.187 --> 37:56.947
The suicidal man.

37:57.015 --> 37:58.678
Okay.

37:58.679 --> 38:00.967
Absolutely does not know he's dead.

38:00.968 --> 38:06.015
And someone who has killed themselves,
like, they typically know

38:06.016 --> 38:08.325
they killed themselves.

38:08.326 --> 38:13.169
I just could not make
sense of the situation.

38:13.170 --> 38:15.489
Let me give you a little
background about George Taylor.

38:15.490 --> 38:18.265
George Taylor was Pearl's father.

38:18.266 --> 38:22.808
Now before they moved here, they had a
son that was 3 years old that died,

38:22.809 --> 38:25.629
so he had already lost a child once before.

38:25.630 --> 38:27.420
He died in this house,

38:27.421 --> 38:31.214
um, but he had had a stroke a
couple months before he died,

38:31.215 --> 38:32.807
and he died suddenly.

38:32.808 --> 38:36.079
That sounds like the man I sketched.

38:36.080 --> 38:41.980
So I'm gonna get to see it tonight
for the first time with you guys.

39:01.587 --> 39:05.847
This is George Taylor, Pearl's father.

39:10.993 --> 39:12.813
That looks just like him.

39:12.814 --> 39:18.574
- Yeah, it does.
- It looks just like him, it really does.

39:18.727 --> 39:20.587
Wow.

39:27.587 --> 39:30.826
Well, Robert, Carol, you saw the
results of our investigation.

39:30.827 --> 39:35.310
The most important thing, though, is
are you safe, and more importantly,

39:35.311 --> 39:38.065
is Melanie okay? Is she gonna be safe?

39:38.066 --> 39:43.966
Uh, I can't answer that.
Amy's gonna have to answer that for you.

39:50.630 --> 39:53.580
There are things you need to do.

39:53.581 --> 39:55.923
You have to contact a priest.

39:55.924 --> 40:00.145
The priest needs to come and do last rites.

40:00.146 --> 40:06.026
No one is to be mentioned by
name when he does this, okay?

40:06.552 --> 40:11.232
And then, you have him do a funeral speech.

40:12.316 --> 40:14.718
And then a house blessing.

40:14.719 --> 40:16.983
What about these two guys upstairs?

40:16.984 --> 40:19.303
That's the blessing part.

40:19.304 --> 40:23.300
That's going to get rid of the
women, the two men upstairs,

40:23.301 --> 40:27.441
and then Pearl and and.. Her father.

40:27.890 --> 40:30.204
Like the living, the dead need closure,

40:30.205 --> 40:32.734
especially if they don't
know that they've died.

40:32.735 --> 40:35.927
I believe performing a funeral
will help Pearl and her father

40:35.928 --> 40:41.828
understand they're dead and that they
need to move on from this house.

40:42.080 --> 40:43.725
It'll get rid of her father, also?

40:43.726 --> 40:45.586
Yes.

40:46.502 --> 40:48.702
It may not be..

40:48.703 --> 40:51.523
A calm experience.

40:51.869 --> 40:55.114
What do you mean by, "it may
not be a calm experience"?

40:55.115 --> 41:01.015
Um, you're dealing with, um, several
people who might be emotional

41:01.146 --> 41:05.699
going through this, so there
may be things that happen.

41:05.700 --> 41:08.529
Any kind of shaking, things
falling off the walls,

41:08.530 --> 41:11.897
um, any loud bangs from up there.

41:11.898 --> 41:14.800
I mean, how am I gonna go
to our local priest here,

41:14.801 --> 41:19.943
come in and do this? I mean, honestly,
he's gonna look at me like I'm nuts.

41:19.944 --> 41:22.918
- Not necessarily. You'd be surprised.
- Okay, okay.

41:22.919 --> 41:27.734
I will tell you this, if Amy tells you
to do something, you should do it.

41:27.735 --> 41:29.495
- Absolutely, absolutely.
- We will.

41:29.496 --> 41:31.836
Okay, good.

41:34.023 --> 41:35.849
If Carol and Robert do nothing,

41:35.850 --> 41:38.912
the activity in the house
could pick up dramatically.

41:38.913 --> 41:40.956
I hope they follow my advice.

41:40.957 --> 41:45.172
If they do, it should set the dead
free and finally allow the family

41:45.173 --> 41:48.833
to enjoy their home in peace.
