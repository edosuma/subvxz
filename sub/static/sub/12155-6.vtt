"To save himself
and the blonde,

01:13.645 --> 01:16.983
Harry slapped the large bag
of cocaine into the air.

01:17.017 --> 01:18.986
Then Harry sent his fist,

01:19.020 --> 01:21.022
which was the size
of a small dictionary,

01:21.056 --> 01:24.093
- into the drug dealer's throat.

01:25.329 --> 01:27.598
<i>- Ames here.
- Jonathan, it's leah.</i>

01:27.633 --> 01:30.135
Oh hi, leah.

01:30.169 --> 01:31.971
I'm in your neighborhood.
Could I come by?

01:32.005 --> 01:34.041
There's something I need
to talk to you about.

01:34.075 --> 01:36.043
Here?

01:36.078 --> 01:38.948
The place is very
grey gardens at the moment.

01:38.982 --> 01:41.518
<i>- I've been writing.
- Oh, it doesn't matter.</i>

01:41.552 --> 01:43.354
I'll be right over.

01:43.388 --> 01:45.991
How's Ray?

01:46.025 --> 01:48.294
He's, um...

01:48.328 --> 01:49.996
Making the best of it.

01:56.172 --> 01:59.008
- Let's take a break.
- Okay.

02:02.815 --> 02:05.318
I want
to take a picture.

02:05.352 --> 02:07.688
Red hook is so weird
and beautiful.

02:09.157 --> 02:11.126
Okay.

02:12.329 --> 02:14.164
I could've been somebody.

02:14.198 --> 02:16.299
<i>What?
You are somebody.</i>

02:16.334 --> 02:18.268
You created Super Ray.

02:18.303 --> 02:19.737
No, it's marlon Brando.

02:19.772 --> 02:21.373
It's a little lesser known line.

02:21.407 --> 02:23.509
"On the waterfront"
was set in red hook.

02:23.543 --> 02:25.478
Cool. I didn't know that.
I like Brando.

02:25.512 --> 02:27.146
I wish he wasn't dead.

02:27.181 --> 02:29.316
Kiss?

02:33.222 --> 02:35.658
- What are you doing now?
- Oh, I'm tweeting our photo.

02:35.692 --> 02:37.760
None of my friends
believe I'm dating you.

02:37.795 --> 02:39.863
Tweeting?
So cute.

02:39.897 --> 02:42.733
Yo, are those ears real?

02:42.767 --> 02:44.702
Of course they are.

02:44.737 --> 02:47.506
- What, is it Christmas?
- What's it to you, gaylord?

02:47.540 --> 02:51.108
Yo, nothing, man.
Elves are cool.

03:00.283 --> 03:03.017
You are the sexiest guy
I have ever met.

03:03.052 --> 03:04.986
I know.

03:10.959 --> 03:13.493
So here's a picture
of little Ray.

03:13.528 --> 03:15.862
We got him from
a rescue shelter.

03:15.897 --> 03:18.131
I'll need this for
my investigation.

03:18.165 --> 03:20.233
Why'd you name him little Ray?

03:20.267 --> 03:23.034
The girls said that he and
Ray have the same eyes.

03:23.069 --> 03:25.837
I guess I can see that...
a certain sadness.

03:25.871 --> 03:28.506
So tell me again what
happened from the beginning.

03:28.540 --> 03:30.607
As a Detective
I need all the details.

03:30.641 --> 03:33.575
Also I'm a little stoned.

03:33.610 --> 03:36.478
Okay. So I tied him up
outside the pharmacy

03:36.513 --> 03:39.148
just for a second and when
I came out he was gone.

03:39.183 --> 03:41.984
- Oh my God.
- So when I got home the phone rings

03:42.019 --> 03:43.985
and this man says,
"I have little Ray."

03:44.020 --> 03:45.820
'Cause my number was
on his dog collar.

03:45.854 --> 03:47.555
I was like, "oh my God,
thank you."

03:47.589 --> 03:50.891
Then he says all cold,
"how much for him?"

03:50.925 --> 03:52.559
Ransom for a dog.

03:52.593 --> 03:54.495
I know this world
is insane, but still...

03:54.529 --> 03:58.732
So I blurted out
stupidly "40 bucks"

03:58.767 --> 04:01.167
and he hung up
and he hasn't called back.

04:01.202 --> 04:04.236
The girls are heartbroken,
crying every night.

04:04.270 --> 04:06.572
It's okay.
I'll find him.

04:06.606 --> 04:08.440
I don't want your girls
to be upset.

04:08.475 --> 04:10.809
They've already lost one Ray.

04:10.843 --> 04:12.544
They shouldn't lose two.

04:21.519 --> 04:23.186
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.

04:23.221 --> 04:26.489
- I-I... I'm stoned and tipsy.
- I'm also tipsy.

04:26.523 --> 04:29.958
Oh... Jonathan, I can't believe
that almost happened.

04:29.993 --> 04:32.394
We only leaned.
A lean means nothing.

04:32.428 --> 04:34.062
I do it naturally all the time.

04:34.096 --> 04:36.330
I have bad posture from depression.
I just...

04:36.364 --> 04:38.498
you're right, you're right.
It was only a lean.

04:38.532 --> 04:39.866
But you know, I should go.

04:39.900 --> 04:42.101
- Oh, I feel guilty.
- Me too, me too.

04:42.136 --> 04:45.671
But we were just projecting our
love for Ray onto each other.

04:45.705 --> 04:49.573
Right. So you'll try
to find little Ray?

04:49.608 --> 04:51.975
Of course.
But, leah,

04:52.010 --> 04:53.810
should we actually kiss

04:53.845 --> 04:55.878
so that our guilt
doesn't go to waste?

04:55.913 --> 04:58.614
- I've always thought you were
very beautiful. - Jonathan!

04:58.648 --> 05:00.616
<i>It's Ray!</i>

05:00.650 --> 05:02.651
Do you think he knows?
Is that...

05:02.685 --> 05:04.686
Jonathan, don't be paranoid.

05:04.720 --> 05:07.088
<i>Let's just pretend
like nothing happened,</i>

05:07.122 --> 05:10.024
which will be easy,
because nothing did happen.

05:10.058 --> 05:12.592
Well, I'm sorry about the
nothing that didn't happen

05:12.627 --> 05:15.762
and, leah, I will find
little Ray for you.

05:27.239 --> 05:30.741

05:33.845 --> 05:37.046
She's a nice kid, but it's
just hard to be in public

05:37.081 --> 05:38.714
with a girl
that's got elf ears.

05:38.749 --> 05:40.683
She lent me her huge
bike, which is nice.

05:40.717 --> 05:43.251
Does she have other elf organs?

05:43.286 --> 05:45.053
No.
That's what I thought.

05:45.087 --> 05:47.555
I thought she'd have fairy
dust down there or something.

05:47.590 --> 05:49.790
Completely normal
from the neck down.

05:50.792 --> 05:52.793
But I feel bad when I kiss her.

05:52.827 --> 05:55.095
All I do is think about leah

05:55.129 --> 05:57.830
and how her ears are regular.

06:00.300 --> 06:01.933
I saw le today.

06:04.002 --> 06:06.737
What? Where?
Did she say she misses me?

06:06.771 --> 06:08.772
Yeah, she misses you.

06:08.806 --> 06:10.940
I saw her at my place.

06:10.974 --> 06:13.842
- Why? - She needs my
help as a Detective.

06:13.877 --> 06:15.244
What does she want you to do?

06:15.278 --> 06:17.679
She got the girls a dog,
but it was stolen.

06:17.714 --> 06:19.514
The guy who took it
had the audacity

06:19.549 --> 06:21.683
to ask for ransom,
but she lowballed him.

06:21.717 --> 06:23.518
She does have
a secret cheap side.

06:23.552 --> 06:25.186
The whole time we were together

06:25.220 --> 06:27.454
not once did she raise my allowance.
Go ahead.

06:27.489 --> 06:30.324
Anyway, she lowballed him
and he hung up the phone.

06:30.358 --> 06:32.659
I guess he must have
sold the dog or something,

06:32.693 --> 06:34.293
but leah wants me
to try to find him.

06:34.328 --> 06:36.195
<i>What a bastard,</i>

06:36.229 --> 06:38.130
wanting money for a lost dog.

06:38.164 --> 06:40.098
I don't know if you're
gonna like this,

06:40.132 --> 06:42.467
but leah and the girls
named the dog

06:42.501 --> 06:44.435
little Ray.

06:45.971 --> 06:48.038
Yeah, I like that.

06:50.908 --> 06:52.908
It means they miss me.

06:54.377 --> 06:57.312
- What kind of dog is it?
- He's a... oh here.

06:59.281 --> 07:01.515
- Not the most...
- Good God.

07:01.550 --> 07:03.650
That is one ugly pooch.

07:03.685 --> 07:06.920
With that scrunched face
he looks like an alien.

07:06.954 --> 07:09.589
He's got nice eyes though.

07:09.623 --> 07:12.891
- Yeah. - So how are we
gonna find this gargoyle?

07:50.691 --> 07:53.025
besides getting a drink?

07:53.059 --> 07:54.560
Now we wait.

07:54.594 --> 07:56.528
Either the jerk
who grabbed little Ray

07:56.562 --> 07:58.563
will come out from under his
rock to collect the reward.

07:58.597 --> 08:01.165
Or if he sold the dog, maybe
that person will call us.

08:01.200 --> 08:03.634
- What'll it be?
- One budweiser

08:03.668 --> 08:05.736
and a glass of your
worst white wine

08:05.770 --> 08:07.637
for my friend, on me.

08:07.671 --> 08:10.473
You know, George is having
his surgery tomorrow.

08:10.507 --> 08:13.142
I know. Poor George.
Such a good guy.

08:13.176 --> 08:15.610
Shouldn't have
shot me that time,

08:15.645 --> 08:17.312
but he always
picks up the check.

08:17.346 --> 08:20.514
<i>- Thanks.
- Cin cin.</i>

08:23.751 --> 08:26.085
After this, I got to go home
and finish my short story

08:26.120 --> 08:27.820
for "the new yorker" contest.

08:27.855 --> 08:30.789
- What's the gist of it. - It's about a p.
I. Named Harry Parker.

08:30.824 --> 08:34.491
It's a Pulp Fiction take on how I beat
those drug dealers in prospect park.

08:34.527 --> 08:36.693
I turned Greene
into a femme fatale...

08:36.727 --> 08:39.830
- a sexy blonde.
- Greene would make a good woman.

08:39.865 --> 08:42.365
- He has nice hips.
- Huh.

08:52.942 --> 08:54.775
Oh hey, perfect timing.

08:54.810 --> 08:57.578
Do you think that
I'll need two bathrobes?

08:57.612 --> 09:00.180
Well, you're just staying
at the hospital overnight,

09:00.215 --> 09:03.650
- so probably just one. - You're right.
I better bring both.

09:05.385 --> 09:08.754
- George.
- Oh, very good.

09:08.788 --> 09:10.489
- Oh hi.
- Hi.

09:10.523 --> 09:14.225
- Donna, that's Jonathan. - Oh.
Oh oh, it's so nice to meet you.

09:14.260 --> 09:16.460
George talks about you
all the time.

09:16.495 --> 09:18.362
I'm so sorry about
your career struggles.

09:18.396 --> 09:20.397
- Don't...
- Right.

09:20.431 --> 09:22.832
I just want to thank you
for taking care of George

09:22.867 --> 09:24.400
and his prostate.

09:24.435 --> 09:26.435
Oh, of course.
He'll be fine.

09:26.470 --> 09:29.405
I haven't made any
surgical errors in years.

09:29.439 --> 09:32.540
- Oh. ( Chuckles ) - I'd better get going.
My first surgery's at 10:00.

09:32.575 --> 09:33.941
Okay.

09:36.945 --> 09:40.080
So nice to meet you.

09:40.114 --> 09:42.615
Nice to meet you too,
Dr. Kenwood.

09:46.153 --> 09:49.121
- She seems great.
- Yeah, she's lovely.

09:51.157 --> 09:53.391
You all right, George?
How are you feeling?

09:53.425 --> 09:55.193
To be honest,
I'm a little upset.

09:55.227 --> 09:56.894
The way I see it,
I have two options:

09:56.928 --> 10:00.297
One, I come out of this
impotent and incontinent;

10:00.331 --> 10:03.133
Or two, I die under anesthesia.

10:03.167 --> 10:07.203
Oh no, please, George, you have
to visualize a perfect recovery...

10:07.237 --> 10:09.704
beautiful strong erections,

10:09.739 --> 10:12.774
vitality, controlled urination.

10:12.808 --> 10:14.842
You're absolutely right.

10:14.877 --> 10:17.344
All right, just tell me
what's going on with you.

10:17.379 --> 10:20.013
The best positive
thinking in life

10:20.048 --> 10:21.548
is thinking of others.

10:21.582 --> 10:23.583
So what's happening?

10:23.617 --> 10:25.518
Distract me.

10:25.552 --> 10:28.620
Well, I finished my story
for "The New Yorker" contest.

10:28.655 --> 10:31.389
- I mailed it in this morning.
- Tell me the opening lines.

10:31.424 --> 10:33.491
I love opening lines.

10:35.260 --> 10:39.629
"In Harry's hand,
the gun looked like a toy.

10:39.664 --> 10:42.799
The gun was big,
but his hand was bigger."

10:42.833 --> 10:44.734
<i>I like that.</i>

10:44.768 --> 10:47.369
- Very hardboiled.
- Sorry.

10:47.404 --> 10:50.705
<i>- Hello. -  Are you the
person looking for little Ray?"</i>

10:50.740 --> 10:53.141
Yes, I am.

10:53.175 --> 10:55.009
Yeah, that's the one.

10:55.043 --> 10:58.278
Cute little thing.
Beautiful eyes.

10:58.313 --> 11:00.313
That's what I thought.
I love his eyes.

11:00.348 --> 11:02.715
They remind me of my nat.
That's why I wanted him.

11:02.750 --> 11:05.351
- Nat was your dog?
- No, my husband.

11:05.385 --> 11:07.686
He died at the deli last year.

11:07.720 --> 11:11.623
Went for some half-and-half
for my coffee, never came back.

11:11.657 --> 11:13.825
I should've just
drank it black.

11:13.859 --> 11:15.026
I'm sorry.

11:15.060 --> 11:18.028
You kind of have
his build, you know?

11:18.062 --> 11:20.797
Ha. That's what I liked
when I was younger...

11:20.832 --> 11:23.599
feel a man's weight.

11:23.634 --> 11:25.668
It helps you forget
your troubles.

11:25.702 --> 11:30.338
That's right. A lot of women today,
they don't appreciate heft.

11:30.372 --> 11:32.640
So about little Ray.

11:32.674 --> 11:35.742
- Where did you see him?
- The nevins street dog man

11:35.776 --> 11:37.510
brought him here yesterday.

11:37.545 --> 11:39.179
He's a pooch peddler,

11:39.213 --> 11:42.048
mostly little dogs.
He knew I was looking for one

11:42.082 --> 11:44.049
because nat passed on,

11:44.084 --> 11:46.451
but he wanted too much money.

11:46.485 --> 11:48.820
- That must be the guy
who called leah. - Yeah.

11:48.854 --> 11:51.356
- How much did he want?
- $200. Yeah.

11:51.390 --> 11:54.325
Then I was up at park slope,
you know, where it's fancy?

11:54.359 --> 11:56.160
That's where I saw your flier.

11:56.194 --> 11:57.461
I went to see my daughter.

11:57.495 --> 11:59.062
She lives very nice...

11:59.097 --> 12:01.364
married to a Jewish lawyer.

12:02.433 --> 12:05.168
- Are you Jewish?
- Yes.

12:05.202 --> 12:08.204
Good.
Steady income is nice.

12:08.238 --> 12:09.972
Right right.

12:10.006 --> 12:14.843
So where can we find
this nevins street dog man?

12:14.877 --> 12:19.280
Well, he's not called the
Carol street dog man, is he?

12:19.314 --> 12:20.648
That's right.

12:24.519 --> 12:26.719
Well hello,
Mr. Christiansen.

12:26.754 --> 12:30.022
- It's Christopher.
- Oh my God, you brought a lot of baggage.

12:30.057 --> 12:33.492
When I get nervous I overpack.

12:33.526 --> 12:35.227
Do you think
I brought too much?

12:35.261 --> 12:36.961
Yes, but it's okay.

12:36.996 --> 12:40.164
So you've had no liquids
or food since last night?

12:40.199 --> 12:41.699
Nothing.

12:41.733 --> 12:45.435
Actually, you know,
I did brush my teeth

12:45.470 --> 12:48.071
and some water may have
seeped down my throat.

12:48.105 --> 12:51.407
Should we reschedule?
I know I swallowed some toothpaste.

12:51.441 --> 12:53.309
Why don't I call
Dr. Kenwood?

12:53.343 --> 12:55.510
It's okay.
Toothpaste is fine.

12:55.545 --> 12:59.347
So strip down and I'll be back
to shave your pubic zone.

12:59.381 --> 13:02.583
What? Nobody said anything
about shaving down there.

13:02.617 --> 13:04.451
No... oh God.

13:04.485 --> 13:07.620
Oh, that's not fair.

13:10.991 --> 13:14.460
There's little Ray.
Hi!

13:14.494 --> 13:17.496
This explains all the
missing dog posters we saw.

13:17.531 --> 13:19.231
I think I have my next story...

13:19.266 --> 13:21.200
"the nevins street dog man"...

13:21.234 --> 13:22.935
a Harry Parker mystery.

13:24.203 --> 13:26.268
His picture doesn't
do him any justice.

13:26.303 --> 13:29.404
He has a strange forehead,
but that's a good-looking dog.

13:29.438 --> 13:31.740
- Hi!
- It's locked.

13:31.774 --> 13:34.608
Well, we'll get
some bolt cutters

13:34.643 --> 13:36.143
and we'll free little Ray.

13:36.177 --> 13:38.144
Right. And these
other guys too.

13:38.179 --> 13:41.281
- Tch tch tch. - I recognize
most of them from the posters.

13:41.315 --> 13:44.117
<i>There's mochi,
tulip, Mr. Chow.</i>

13:44.151 --> 13:46.385
You really like
little Ray, don't you?

13:46.420 --> 13:48.353
Yeah.

13:48.388 --> 13:50.488
He's like
a dog version of a son.

13:50.523 --> 13:52.290
His mother is
the woman that I love

13:52.325 --> 13:54.026
and we have the same name.

13:54.060 --> 13:55.461
Right.

13:55.495 --> 13:57.329
We'll be back, little Ray.

14:04.835 --> 14:06.368
Lift up your gown, please.

14:06.403 --> 14:08.003
Uh, before we start,

14:08.038 --> 14:12.007
for some reason my old coloring
has held true down there.

14:12.041 --> 14:14.909
Um, will it
grow back like that?

14:14.944 --> 14:19.546
It's just nice to hold on to
one's youth any way you can.

14:19.580 --> 14:21.047
I don't know.

14:21.082 --> 14:23.149
I never had
a patient come back.

14:28.488 --> 14:30.989
This is the best case
we've ever worked.

14:31.023 --> 14:32.724
I thought you hated my cases.

14:32.758 --> 14:34.459
I do, but this one's different.

14:34.493 --> 14:37.261
This is my opening
to win leah back.

14:37.296 --> 14:39.330
<i>You really do want
her back, don't you?</i>

14:39.364 --> 14:41.332
Of course I do.

14:41.366 --> 14:43.467
Ray, there's something
I need to tell you.

14:43.501 --> 14:45.569
Oh God, I hate
when you do this.

14:45.603 --> 14:48.338
It's like forcing a man
to look up at the guillotine.

14:48.372 --> 14:51.640
Go ahead and chop my head off with
whatever weird thing you need to say.

14:51.675 --> 14:54.476
Okay.
I feel terrible,

14:54.511 --> 14:56.711
but yesterday
I almost kissed leah.

15:03.285 --> 15:05.953
Ray, I'm sorry!

15:05.987 --> 15:07.321
Raymond!

15:08.289 --> 15:10.657
<i>Ray.</i>

15:10.691 --> 15:12.525
Wait, listen.

15:12.559 --> 15:15.228
I just leaned towards her.
It was only a lean.

15:15.262 --> 15:17.163
And she would've
rejected me anyway.

15:17.197 --> 15:20.032
Of course she would've rejected you,
but why did you try to kiss her?

15:20.066 --> 15:22.033
She just seemed
so sad about the dog.

15:22.068 --> 15:24.969
- Maybe I wanted to kiss her on your behalf.
- That's bullshit.

15:25.003 --> 15:28.172
Ray, I'm sorry if I hurt you.
Please forgive me.

15:31.243 --> 15:34.211
Well, I banged Suzanne.

15:34.245 --> 15:36.313
- You did?
- No.

15:36.347 --> 15:37.914
Of course not.
I didn't bang Suzanne.

15:37.948 --> 15:39.982
I wanted to.
I wanted to bang all your girlfriends.

15:40.016 --> 15:41.584
I wish you had.

15:41.618 --> 15:43.952
You can if you want to.

15:46.389 --> 15:49.623
Well, you didn't actually
kiss her and I understand.

15:49.658 --> 15:52.526
Leah's the most beautiful
girl in the world, so...

15:54.295 --> 15:55.628
Let's just forget about it.

15:55.663 --> 15:59.231
Forgetting, forgotten.
Forgotted!

15:59.266 --> 16:02.100
Don't push it
with the wordplay.

16:04.069 --> 16:06.003
I've missed you.

16:06.038 --> 16:08.005
I've missed you.

16:08.039 --> 16:09.573
I always miss you.

16:09.607 --> 16:11.708
Why don't we ever
work things out?

16:11.742 --> 16:13.743
I guess we're like children...

16:13.777 --> 16:16.712
that thing we can't reach
is the thing we want.

16:21.884 --> 16:24.485
Why don't you crawl on up here?

16:24.519 --> 16:27.421
They shaved my pubic zone.

16:27.456 --> 16:29.556
I would've liked
to have done that for you.

16:29.591 --> 16:31.691
Oh God, look at you.

16:31.726 --> 16:34.894
Oh.

16:36.196 --> 16:39.231
I am so glad that possibly

16:39.265 --> 16:41.699
the last erection of my life

16:41.734 --> 16:43.634
is with you.

16:44.970 --> 16:47.338
I guess that's your line
with all the girls.

16:47.372 --> 16:49.339
It sounded so sincere
this morning.

16:49.374 --> 16:52.509
Dr. Kenwood,
this is not what...

16:52.543 --> 16:54.477
what you think.

16:54.511 --> 16:57.479
- This is, uh... This is, uh...
- Priscilla.

16:57.514 --> 16:59.081
Priscilla
my ex-wife.

16:59.115 --> 17:02.851
And we were just snuggling
for old times' sake.

17:02.885 --> 17:05.653
That's all, nothing more.

17:05.686 --> 17:07.688
Priscilla, this is my doctor.

17:07.722 --> 17:11.357
Nice to meet you.
Yes.

17:15.895 --> 17:18.596
- Well, I'll see you at 6:00 P.M....
- Mm-hmm.

17:18.630 --> 17:20.664
...But you'll be under
so you won't see me.

17:20.698 --> 17:23.335
It should all go well, I hope.

17:23.368 --> 17:25.337
You hope?

17:26.606 --> 17:28.106
Donna...
Donna?

17:28.141 --> 17:31.475
Are you sleeping
with your doctor?

17:31.510 --> 17:34.378
Well, she is a urologist.

17:47.790 --> 17:50.692
Is that bastard feeding them cat food?
That is so low.

17:50.726 --> 17:53.626
We're just gonna have to wait
here and then we'll bust 'em out.

17:53.660 --> 17:55.361
Shit.
I don't know if I've got time.

17:55.395 --> 17:56.895
George's surgery's
in two hours.

17:56.930 --> 17:58.463
I said I'd see him
before he went in.

17:58.497 --> 18:00.065
- Maybe we can come back tonight.
- No, it's too risky.

18:00.099 --> 18:01.967
We've got to wait this out.
Something could happen.

18:02.001 --> 18:04.436
- But I can't miss the surgery.
- You go take care of George.

18:04.471 --> 18:06.305
- I'll take care of little Ray.
- Are you sure?

18:06.339 --> 18:08.573
- You're okay on your own?
- Yes.

18:08.607 --> 18:10.308
I'm good with bolt cutters.

18:10.342 --> 18:13.244
I've never used them before
but they feel like scissors.

18:13.278 --> 18:14.945
Okay. I'll call you
when I'm done.

18:14.979 --> 18:17.647
And Ray, I'm sorry about...

18:17.681 --> 18:19.182
I've forgotten about it, okay?

18:19.216 --> 18:21.217
But just know one day,

18:21.251 --> 18:24.186
- I'm gonna almost kiss somebody
that you love. - Right.

18:24.220 --> 18:26.188
Tell George that I'm rooting
for him, all right?

18:26.222 --> 18:28.890
- I'm going to pray for his cock.
- That'll mean a lot to George.

18:28.924 --> 18:31.792
Do you have to ruin everything?
Go.

18:48.840 --> 18:50.774
I'm just glad

18:50.809 --> 18:54.978
that possibly my last
erection in life is with you.

18:55.012 --> 18:57.280
Did you really use the
same line with both women?

18:57.314 --> 19:00.082
Yes.
And I meant it each time.

19:00.083 --> 19:02.885
Oh my God.
You don't think that Donna

19:02.919 --> 19:05.420
will take it out on me on the
operating table, do you?

19:05.454 --> 19:06.854
I don't know.
I would hope not.

19:06.889 --> 19:09.090
Oh God, I'm such an idiot.

19:09.124 --> 19:12.559
Well, one good thing... if I die,
I can't get any stupider.

19:12.593 --> 19:14.594
George, you're not stupid.

19:14.628 --> 19:16.629
Yes, I am.
I'm 62 years old

19:16.663 --> 19:19.898
and I'm still just
utterly confused

19:19.933 --> 19:21.633
- about everything.
- Like what?

19:21.667 --> 19:25.336
Myself, women, men,
life in general.

19:25.370 --> 19:27.137
I guess that's it.

19:27.172 --> 19:29.439
Well, you have covered
all the bases.

19:29.473 --> 19:31.141
Well, I do like to be thorough.

19:31.175 --> 19:34.043
<i>Mr. Christiansen, sweetie,</i>

19:34.078 --> 19:36.412
I'll be back in a second with a
chair to take you to surgery.

19:36.446 --> 19:38.580
Thank you, dear.

19:40.216 --> 19:41.816
- "Christiansen"?
- I don't know.

19:41.850 --> 19:43.584
She's been getting it
wrong all day.

19:43.618 --> 19:46.153
Everybody does, actually,
ever since I was a kid.

19:46.187 --> 19:50.123
She's very nice.
She shaved my pubic area.

19:50.158 --> 19:52.724
Had a nice soft touch.

19:56.128 --> 19:58.563
George,

19:58.597 --> 20:01.299
I just want you
to know that, um,

20:01.333 --> 20:04.601
well, I love you.

20:07.671 --> 20:09.772
Okay, good-looking,
in you go.

20:16.479 --> 20:19.381
Is this your son?

20:19.415 --> 20:20.815
Yes.

20:20.850 --> 20:24.118
Your dad'll be okay.
I promise.

20:24.152 --> 20:27.521
George. I'll be here
when you get back.

20:27.555 --> 20:29.222
I know.

20:56.813 --> 20:58.747
I'll tell you
who let the dogs out.

21:27.806 --> 21:30.240
Oh my God.

21:30.274 --> 21:32.408
They've got the wrong George.

22:52.873 --> 22:54.674

22:54.708 --> 22:56.776
- Stop!
- Grab him!

22:56.810 --> 22:59.178
What?
Queens?

23:08.620 --> 23:11.488
Oh my God.
Ray.

23:11.522 --> 23:13.289
Mommy, look!
Little Ray's back!

23:13.324 --> 23:15.858
All right, let's go inside.

23:15.893 --> 23:19.195
- I don't understand.
- Jonathan asked me to help on the case

23:19.229 --> 23:20.596
so I did.

23:20.630 --> 23:23.265
They've missed him
so much. Thank you.

23:23.299 --> 23:25.167
Yeah, I'll bet
he's happy to be home.

23:25.201 --> 23:28.536
<i>Mom, little Ray
already peed on the floor.</i>

23:28.570 --> 23:30.504
<i>And now he's going
number two!</i>

23:30.538 --> 23:32.338
I really like that little guy.

23:32.373 --> 23:35.508
Well, I should probably
go clean that up.

23:35.542 --> 23:36.809
Okay.

23:38.378 --> 23:40.979
It was really nice seeing you.

23:41.014 --> 23:43.781
You look great, big Ray.

23:43.816 --> 23:46.350
So do you, big leah.

23:46.384 --> 23:48.585
Thanks for saving little Ray.

23:50.622 --> 23:53.323
- Okay.
- I'll see you later.

23:55.760 --> 23:57.327
See you later.

24:05.501 --> 24:09.336
All right, guys.
That went pretty well, I think.

24:09.370 --> 24:11.504
I've got a lot
of calls to make.

24:11.539 --> 24:14.107
What's that?
You don't like cat food?

24:14.141 --> 24:16.976
Well, you know what?
If you heat it up, it ain't that bad.

24:17.010 --> 24:18.610
All right.
Here we go, here we go.

24:18.645 --> 24:22.613
So it was a real
Mexican standoff.

24:22.648 --> 24:24.682
Donna broke up with me
because of Priscilla.

24:24.716 --> 24:28.652
Then I broke up with Donna because of
her office's grievous clerical error.

24:28.686 --> 24:30.353
This whole thing is so insane.

24:30.387 --> 24:33.422
I know. I have
to rethink everything.

24:33.456 --> 24:36.058
I do want to thank you,
though, for saving me.

24:36.092 --> 24:38.660
Oh my God.
I'm so glad I still have a prostate.

24:38.694 --> 24:41.195
- Of course, George.
- I guess I could sue, right?

24:41.230 --> 24:43.465
But for what?
Loss of pubic hair?

24:43.499 --> 24:46.668
Truth of the matter is this is
the best I've felt in years.

24:46.702 --> 24:51.171
There's nothing like finding
out you don't have cancer.

24:51.206 --> 24:53.273
This should happen more often.

24:53.307 --> 24:56.475
Poor George Christiansen
when he finds out.

24:56.509 --> 24:59.944
Oh my God.
I hadn't even considered that.

24:59.979 --> 25:02.647
Well, I guess I could write
him a thank-you note.

25:02.681 --> 25:05.116
Would that be appropriate?

25:05.117 --> 25:15.117
