00:02.703 --> 00:04.775
(Meredith) EVERY CELL
IN THE HUMAN BODY

00:04.775 --> 00:07.238
REGENERATES, ON AVERAGE,

00:07.238 --> 00:11.082
EVERY SEVEN YEARS.

00:11.082 --> 00:12.683
LIKE SNAKES...

00:12.683 --> 00:16.387
IN OUR OWN WAY,
WE SHED OUR SKIN.

00:16.387 --> 00:19.620
BIOLOGICALLY,
WE'RE BRAND-NEW PEOPLE.

00:19.620 --> 00:22.453
ARE YOU VISITING SEATTLE
FOR THE FIRST TIME?

00:22.453 --> 00:24.795
OH, NO, NO.
I LIVE IN SEATTLE.

00:24.795 --> 00:26.797
I-I JUST WENT HOME
FOR A MONTH.

00:26.797 --> 00:28.799
I TOOK MY SON
TO SEE MY PARENTS.

00:28.799 --> 00:32.203
OH. WHAT DO YOU DO
IN SEATTLE?

00:32.203 --> 00:34.465
UH, I'M A SURGEON.

00:37.138 --> 00:40.811
UH, UH, DID YOU KNOW
ANY OF THOSE DOCTORS...

00:40.811 --> 00:43.714
(lowered voice)
FROM THAT SHOOTING?

00:45.316 --> 00:48.819
WE MAY LOOK THE SAME.
WE PROBABLY DO.

00:48.819 --> 00:52.123
THE CHANGE ISN'T VISIBLE...

00:52.123 --> 00:55.055
AT LEAST NOT IN MOST OF US.

00:55.055 --> 00:56.687
BUT WE'RE ALL CHANGED...

00:56.687 --> 00:58.529
COMPLETELY...

00:58.529 --> 01:00.391
FOREVER.

01:00.391 --> 01:02.093
BUT THAT'S NORMAL.

01:02.093 --> 01:04.795
I MEAN, IT'S A BIOLOGICAL
IMPERATIVE--CHANGE.

01:04.795 --> 01:07.738
SO THE SHOOTING CHANGED ME.
I'M CHANGED.

01:07.738 --> 01:10.841
BUT I'M ALSO READY
TO GET BACK TO WORK.

01:10.841 --> 01:13.174
I MEAN, AS READY
AS ANY OF US ARE.

01:13.174 --> 01:15.106
SITTING AROUND THE HOUSE,

01:15.106 --> 01:16.247
WAITING...

01:16.247 --> 01:18.309
I JUST SPEND MY TIME
WORRYING.

01:18.309 --> 01:21.652
YOUR HUSBAND WAS SHOT.
THAT'S A LOT TO WORRY ABOUT.

01:21.652 --> 01:23.114
I'M WORRIED ABOUT CRISTINA.

01:23.114 --> 01:25.516
SHE'S GETTING MARRIED,
AND THAT'S JUST...

01:25.516 --> 01:28.389
WELL, I HAD TO CUT HER OUT
OF HER LAST WEDDING DRESS

01:28.389 --> 01:30.090
WITH SCISSORS, SO...

01:30.090 --> 01:32.193
YOU WATCHED YOUR HUSBAND
GET SHOT.

01:32.193 --> 01:35.166
HE'S FINE. HE'S COMING BACK
TO WORK TODAY, ACTUALLY.

01:36.427 --> 01:38.869
(screams inaudibly)
(shell casing clatters)

01:38.869 --> 01:40.371
(monitor emitting
continuous tone)

01:40.371 --> 01:42.133
WE'RE ALL FINE.

01:42.133 --> 01:44.705
(monitor alarm blares)
(pager beeps)

01:44.705 --> 01:46.237
UH, EX-EXCUSE ME.

01:46.237 --> 01:49.180
(beep)

01:50.541 --> 01:51.742
(scoffs)

01:51.742 --> 01:53.884
IS EVERYTHING OKAY,
DR. GREY?

01:53.884 --> 01:57.248
YES. YES.
EVERYTHING'S FINE.

01:57.248 --> 01:58.749
(cell door clatters)

01:58.749 --> 02:00.291
(bangs)
(man) OPENING TWO.

02:00.291 --> 02:02.293
(buzzer sounds)
IT DOESN'T LOOK TOO BAD.

02:02.293 --> 02:04.295
YOU JUST GOTTA KEEP
AN EYE ON IT,

02:04.295 --> 02:06.297
MAKE SURE IT DOESN'T GET
ANY BIGGER.

02:06.297 --> 02:08.459
BUT IF IT CHANGES COLOR,
YOU SHOULD SEE A DOCTOR.
DR. SHEPHERD.

02:08.459 --> 02:09.630
MM.

02:09.630 --> 02:12.733
YOUR LADY LOOKS PISSED.
(buzzer sounds)

02:12.733 --> 02:16.237

02:39.190 --> 02:41.832
OH, DR. BAILEY.
WELCOME BACK.

02:41.832 --> 02:44.835
THANK YOU, SIR.
WE MISSED YOU HERE.

02:44.835 --> 02:47.738
THE PLACE ISN'T THE... SAME.

02:47.738 --> 02:49.840
MM.

02:49.840 --> 02:53.173
UH, DID YOU GET CLEARED
FOR SURGERY?
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
"CLEARED FOR SURGERY"?

02:53.173 --> 02:55.175
WHO HAS TO CLEAR ME?
(elevator bell dings)

02:55.175 --> 02:57.177
WELL, THE NEXT TIME,
I'LL LEAVE YOU THERE.

02:57.177 --> 02:59.179
YOU SAID THAT ALREADY.
OH, DEREK GOT ARRESTED AGAIN.

02:59.179 --> 03:00.751
MEREDITH...
RECKLESS ENDANGERMENT.

03:00.751 --> 03:02.753
PLEASE.
DID HE LOSE
HIS LICENSE YET?

03:02.753 --> 03:04.755
OH, NO, BECAUSE THEY DON'T
CHARGE HIM,

03:04.755 --> 03:06.257
BECAUSE THE COPS WORSHIP HIM.

03:06.257 --> 03:08.259
BECAUSE I SAVED
SOME OF THEIR LIVES.

03:08.259 --> 03:09.720
WHAT ARE WE PICKING?

03:09.720 --> 03:11.722
DRESS COLOR.
I'M NOT WEARING WHITE.
MM.

03:11.722 --> 03:13.724
IT'S SEXIST
AND... VAGUELY RACIST.
OH.

03:13.724 --> 03:16.227
NO WHITE, NO VEIL,
NO RICE.
WELL, WHAT WILL
YOUR MOTHER SAY?

03:16.227 --> 03:18.729
NO MOTHER.
(sighs) YOU KNOW, I DIDN'T
GET CLEARED FOR SURGERY...

03:18.729 --> 03:20.871
GOOD MORNING.
AND I'M PRETTY SURE
IT'S YOUR FAULT.

03:20.871 --> 03:23.734
MEREDITH, I AM THE CHIEF.
I CAN OVERRULE THE COUNSELOR.
YOU CAN?

03:23.734 --> 03:25.736
(chuckles) YES.
I LOVE THE BLUE.

03:25.736 --> 03:27.738
CHIEF SHEPHERD,
YOU'RE BACK.
OKAY.

03:27.738 --> 03:29.740
GOOD MORNING.
I FIND A GIANT
SKULL BASE CHORDOMA.

03:29.740 --> 03:31.982
BIGGEST ONE I'VE EVER SEEN.
REALLY?

03:31.982 --> 03:34.745
HE CAME IN TO THE E.R.
WITH TROUBLE BREATHING.
YOU GOT CLEARED FOR SURGERY?

03:34.745 --> 03:36.717
I DID.
BITCH.

03:36.717 --> 03:39.250
(Cristina)
I LIKE THE BROWN, TOO.
I KNOW IT LOOKS INOPERABLE.

03:39.250 --> 03:41.452
I MEAN, I WOULD'VE SAID
IT WAS INOPERABLE,

03:41.452 --> 03:43.394
BUT YOU'RE BACK
AND YOU'RE YOU.
RIGHT.

03:43.394 --> 03:46.997
HEY, UH, YES, GOOD MORNING.
THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

03:46.997 --> 03:48.499
(staff cheers)

03:48.499 --> 03:50.501
GOOD. THANK YOU.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

03:50.501 --> 03:53.264
IT'S, UH, IT'S GREAT
TO BE BACK. FIRST OF ALL,

03:53.264 --> 03:55.706
I'D LIKE TO THANK DR. WEBBER
FOR STEPPING UP IN MY ABSENCE.

03:55.706 --> 03:57.708
THANK YOU.
(mouths word)

03:57.708 --> 04:00.971
(staff cheers)
UH, I'M GRATEFUL FOR ALL OF YOU,
FOR ALL OF YOUR SUPPORT

04:00.971 --> 04:02.973
DURING MY RECOVERY.
THANK YOU.

04:02.973 --> 04:05.476
UH, IT'S JUST, UH,
SO GREAT TO BE BACK AS CHIEF.

04:05.476 --> 04:09.420
I'M GRATEFUL FOR THE, UH...

04:09.420 --> 04:11.021
(inhales sharply)

04:11.021 --> 04:13.023
I'M SORRY. THAT'S A LIE.

04:13.023 --> 04:16.287
THAT'S WHAT PEOPLE SAY,
AND, UH, THE TRUTH IS...

04:16.287 --> 04:18.359
(man clears throat)

04:18.359 --> 04:20.731
I HATE BEING CHIEF.
I HATE IT.

04:20.731 --> 04:24.295
(staff murmuring)

04:24.295 --> 04:26.997
CHIEF WEBBER...

04:26.997 --> 04:28.399

04:28.399 --> 04:30.401
CHIEF WEBBER IS OUR CHIEF.

04:30.401 --> 04:32.403
UM...

04:32.403 --> 04:34.875
AND I'M SORRY,
BUT THIS GIANT...

04:34.875 --> 04:36.877
SORRY, I GOTTA GO
LOOK AT THIS CHORDOMA.

04:36.877 --> 04:39.650
I, UM, I'M SORRY, BUT...
(chuckles)

04:39.650 --> 04:41.312
I QUIT.

04:41.312 --> 04:43.654
(staff murmuring)

04:43.654 --> 04:46.387
LET'S GO, KEPNER. COME ON.
OH, SORRY. OKAY.

04:46.387 --> 04:48.789
(laughing)
HE JUST QUIT.

04:48.789 --> 04:51.692
(continues laughing)

04:51.692 --> 04:54.024
HE WAS SUPPOSED TO
CLEAR ME FOR SURGERY.

04:54.024 --> 04:55.966
(murmuring continues)

04:55.966 --> 04:59.069
(exhales) YEAH.

04:59.069 --> 05:00.931
THE BULLET'S AT THE SURFACE.

05:00.931 --> 05:03.774
THAT'S GOOD.
I CAN TAKE IT OUT NOW.

05:03.774 --> 05:06.877
NAH. I MEAN, IF IT'S NOT
INFECTED, I'M GONNA KEEP IT.

05:06.877 --> 05:09.380
IT'S MY WAR WOUND.
(chuckles)

05:09.380 --> 05:11.382
BESIDES...

05:11.382 --> 05:12.983
CHICKS DIG THAT CRAP.

05:24.955 --> 05:28.098
(Derek) MM-HMM.
WOW.
YOU WEREN'T KIDDING.

05:28.098 --> 05:30.461
THE LAST SURGEON
BROKE THE DURA,

05:30.461 --> 05:32.933
WHICH ENABLED THE TUMOR
TO MUSHROOM INTO THE BRAIN

05:32.933 --> 05:35.035
AND DOWN INTO THE SPINE.
IT'S WRAPPED AROUND
HIS BRAIN STEM.

05:35.035 --> 05:38.108
(beep)
WHATEVER WE DO,
WE NEED TO DO IT QUICKLY.

05:38.108 --> 05:39.840
THE SIZE OF THIS THING...

05:39.840 --> 05:42.643
NORMALLY I OPEN UP THE SINUSES
OR THE HARD PALATE.

05:42.643 --> 05:45.976
WELL, NOW YOU HAVE TO
OPEN UP BOTH.

05:45.976 --> 05:48.479
YOU WANT ME TO SPLIT
HIS WHOLE FACE OPEN?

05:48.479 --> 05:51.422
SINUSES, HARD PALATE,
TONGUE, JAW--

05:51.422 --> 05:53.754
A BROKEN JAW IS EXCRUCIATING,
LET ALONE THE REST OF IT.

05:53.754 --> 05:55.886
DOES THIS KID KNOW
WHAT HE'S IN FOR?

05:55.886 --> 05:58.829
HE WANTS TO LIVE. I DON'T THINK
HE'S CONCERNED ABOUT THE PAIN.

05:58.829 --> 06:01.462
WELL, BUT YOU DON'T KNOW
HOW ENMESHED THE TUMOR IS.

06:01.462 --> 06:03.794
YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW
IF YOU CAN GET IT ALL.
THANK YOU, DR. GREY.

06:03.794 --> 06:06.867
(Mark) YOU WANT TO TRY
THIS THING, TORRES AND I

06:06.867 --> 06:10.040
ARE GONNA NEED TO COORDINATE.
WHAT ARE WE THINKING, A WEEK?
NO LATER.

06:10.040 --> 06:11.742
I'LL CLEAR MY SCHEDULE.

06:11.742 --> 06:14.405
WELCOME BACK, DR. SHEPHERD.
THANK YOU, DR. TORRES.

06:14.405 --> 06:17.107
YOU'RE NOT EVEN CLEARED
FOR SURGERY YET.
(monitor beeps)

06:17.107 --> 06:20.150

07:18.068 --> 07:20.911
YEAH, YEAH.

07:28.048 --> 07:29.750
DID YOU HEAR

07:29.750 --> 07:31.752
THAT DR. YANG AND DR. HUNT
ARE GETTING MARRIED?

07:31.752 --> 07:33.754
I DID.
IT'S PRETTY GREAT, HUH?

07:33.754 --> 07:35.956
IT'S ALMOST LIKE
A SILVER LINING.

07:35.956 --> 07:37.928
YOU KNOW, I-I'VE READ
A LOT ABOUT TRAUMA

07:37.928 --> 07:39.930
AND HOW, UH,
SOMETIMES PEOPLE

07:39.930 --> 07:42.032
JUST UP
AND CHANGE THEIR LIVES.

07:42.032 --> 07:44.094
THEY SAY THAT THE TRAUMA

07:44.094 --> 07:46.096
WAS THE BEST THING
THAT COULD'VE HAPPENED TO THEM.

07:46.096 --> 07:48.098

07:50.841 --> 07:53.504
AND HOW HAVE YOU BEEN,
DR. GREY?

07:53.504 --> 07:56.877
YOU'VE BEEN THROUGH A LOT
SINCE I LAST SAW YOU.

07:58.979 --> 08:00.480
(gunshot)

08:00.480 --> 08:04.915
(Andrew) DOES, UH, ANYONE
HAVE ANYTHING TO SAY?

08:04.915 --> 08:06.917
I KNOW THAT, UH, A LOT OF YOU

ARE ONLY HERE BECAUSE
THIS HAS BEEN MANDATED.

08:10.591 --> 08:13.063
SO LET'S TALK.

08:18.198 --> 08:19.900
ANYTHING AT ALL?

08:19.900 --> 08:21.902
I ATE A REALLY GOOD TACO

08:21.902 --> 08:24.605
FROM ONE OF THOSE TRUCKS
BY THE SIDE OF THE ROAD.

08:24.605 --> 08:27.037
WHEN?
LAST NIGHT. YOU WERE ASLEEP.

08:27.037 --> 08:29.780
WHICH TRUCK? THE ONE ON 7th?
I WANT TO GO.
I LIKE TACOS.

08:29.780 --> 08:32.843
(April) ME, TOO.
I READ A BOOK...

08:32.843 --> 08:36.016
ABOUT THE HISTORY OF
MASS MURDERS IN THE U.S.

08:36.016 --> 08:38.118
THAT'S--THAT'S THE ACTUAL NAME
OF WHAT HAPPENED TO US.

08:38.118 --> 08:41.151
IT WAS A MASS MURDER. YOU CAN'T
CALL IT A TERRORIST ATTACK,

08:41.151 --> 08:43.153
BECAUSE THE MURDERS
WEREN'T POLITICAL IN NATURE.

08:43.153 --> 08:45.195
AND WE WEREN'T THE VICTIMS
OF A SERIAL KILLER,

08:45.195 --> 08:48.128
BECAUSE MR. CLARK WOULD'VE
HAD TO MURDER SEVERAL PEOPLE

08:48.128 --> 08:50.861
OVER A PERIOD LONGER THAN
30 DAYS IN ORDER TO QUALIFY

08:50.861 --> 08:53.033
AS A SERIAL KILLER. WE COULD
CALL IT A SPREE KILLING...
(gunfire)

08:53.033 --> 08:55.065
WHICH IS DEFINED AS KILLINGS
AT TWO OR MORE LOCATIONS

08:55.065 --> 08:56.867
WITH NO BREAK
OR PAUSE IN BETWEEN,

08:56.867 --> 08:59.610
BECAUSE MR. CLARK SHOT THAT GUY
IN HIS CAR BEFORE HE GOT HERE.

08:59.610 --> 09:02.112
BUT I'M NOT SURE THAT THAT
COUNTS AS A TRUE SECOND LOCATION

09:02.112 --> 09:04.114
SINCE IT WAS SO CLOSE
TO THE HOSPITAL,

09:04.114 --> 09:06.647
WHICH MEANS THAT WE WERE
A MASS MURDER,

09:06.647 --> 09:08.649
BECAUSE IT HAPPENED
AT ONE PLACE, BY ONE PERSON,

09:08.649 --> 09:12.022
AND MORE THAN FOUR PEOPLE
WERE KILLED.

(object rattles)

09:16.987 --> 09:19.159
(taps fingers on table)

09:19.159 --> 09:21.792
OH, THAT WAS QUITE A SHOW
THIS MORNING.

09:21.792 --> 09:23.093
I DIDN'T PLAN IT.

09:23.093 --> 09:25.065
(chuckles) MADE IT BETTER.
ANY REGRETS?

09:25.065 --> 09:27.067
NO. ANY REGRETS ABOUT
PROPOSING TO CRISTINA?

09:27.067 --> 09:28.669
NONE.

09:28.669 --> 09:32.042
GETTING SHOT TURNS OUT TO NOT BE
THE WORST THING AFTER ALL.

09:32.042 --> 09:34.574
I NEED A BEST MAN.

09:34.574 --> 09:36.076
I-I KNOW--

09:36.076 --> 09:38.108
I KNOW WE'RE NOT THAT CLOSE,
BUT...

09:38.108 --> 09:42.853
I DON'T KNOW. YOU BEING MARRIED
TO THE OTHER TWISTED SISTER,

09:42.853 --> 09:45.115
I... (chuckles)
I JUST THOUGHT IT...

09:45.115 --> 09:47.117
IT KINDA MADE US LIKE BROTHERS
OR SOMETHING.

09:47.117 --> 09:49.990
I'D BE HONORED.
IT'S AN HONOR.
THANK YOU.

09:49.990 --> 09:51.992
YOU NEED A BACHELOR PARTY?
NO, NO, NO.

09:51.992 --> 09:54.024
EVEN BETTER.
(elevator bell dings)

09:54.024 --> 09:55.626
(siren wailing)

09:55.626 --> 09:58.068
ON THE, UH,
DAY OF THE SHOOTING,

09:58.068 --> 10:01.632
I UNDERSTAND THAT YOU HAD
A PARTICULARLY DIFFICULT DAY.

10:06.306 --> 10:09.680
ON THE DAY I GAVE BIRTH
TO MY SON,

10:09.680 --> 10:14.214
MY HUSBAND HAD A CAR CRASH,
AND HE NEEDED A CRANIOTOMY,

10:14.214 --> 10:16.917
AND HE ALMOST DIED
ON DEREK SHEPHERD'S TABLE.

10:16.917 --> 10:20.050
NOW THAT WAS
A PARTICULARLY DIFFICULT DAY.

10:20.050 --> 10:23.053
AND AT THE END OF THAT DAY,
MY SON WAS BORN,

10:23.053 --> 10:26.296
AND MY HUSBAND LIVED.

10:26.296 --> 10:30.060
BUT AT THE END OF THIS DAY...

10:32.663 --> 10:34.164
THE, UH...

10:34.164 --> 10:37.207
UNH!
(shell casing clatters)

10:37.207 --> 10:39.139
(Miranda) NO! NO!

10:39.139 --> 10:41.411
UM... THIS DAY

10:41.411 --> 10:44.915
WAS THE WORST DAY
OF MY LIFE.

10:46.246 --> 10:48.178
(Ben) MIRANDA.

10:48.178 --> 10:49.820
(gasps)

10:49.820 --> 10:51.722
I'M SORRY. I DIDN'T MEAN TO--

10:51.722 --> 10:54.725
NO, YOU--YOU DON'T
JUST SNEAK UP ON PEOPLE. OKAY?

10:54.725 --> 10:56.827
YOU DON'T--
I GOT THESE.

10:56.827 --> 10:59.159
I WAS, UM, I WAS PLAYING GOLF.

10:59.159 --> 11:01.932
MY PHONE WAS OFF, AND I'M...

11:01.932 --> 11:06.066
YOU KNOW, 18 PEOPLE GOT SHOT,
11 DIED, ONE IN MY ARMS.

11:06.066 --> 11:10.040
A BOY DIED IN MY ARMS,
AND YOU WERE PLAYING GOLF.

11:10.040 --> 11:12.072
OKAY.
BAILEY--

11:12.072 --> 11:13.944
WE GOTTA GO.
(Tuck babbles)

11:13.944 --> 11:15.946
WELL, WHERE--
WHERE YOU GOING?

11:15.946 --> 11:17.948
HOME, UH, TO MY MOM.
RIGHT?

11:17.948 --> 11:20.711
YEAH? WE'RE GONNA GO SEE
GRANDMA?

11:20.711 --> 11:22.382
YEAH, TUCK.
HERE YOU GO.

11:22.382 --> 11:24.054
WHEN YOU COMING BACK?

11:24.054 --> 11:27.758
OKAY, HERE, HERE.
HERE'S YOUR CAR.

11:29.760 --> 11:32.763
MIRANDA, W--
WHEN ARE YOU COMING BACK?

11:32.763 --> 11:34.064
(engine turns over)

11:34.064 --> 11:36.997
OKAY, OKAY, OKAY, OKAY.

11:36.997 --> 11:40.130
OKAY, TUCK.

11:43.233 --> 11:46.706
HMM.

11:46.706 --> 11:49.109
NO. NO.

11:49.109 --> 11:51.111
M-MOM.

11:51.111 --> 11:53.343
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT
SLICING HIS FACE IN HALF,

11:53.343 --> 11:55.345
BREAKING HIS JAW,
CUTTING HIS TONGUE.

11:55.345 --> 11:58.118
IT'S JUST--
IT JUST SOUNDS CRAZY.

11:58.118 --> 12:00.320
I KNOW.

12:00.320 --> 12:04.324
I WISH I COULD OFFER
SOME COMFORT, BUT HONESTLY,

12:04.324 --> 12:07.427
THERE'S NO COMFORT THAT CAN
BE OFFERED IN THIS SITUATION.

12:07.427 --> 12:10.000
LET ME JUST SAY THAT...

12:10.000 --> 12:12.302
EVERY MEDICAL ADVANCEMENT
STARTED WITH THE STATEMENT,

12:12.302 --> 12:15.135
"THAT SOUNDS CRAZY."

12:15.135 --> 12:17.237
LET ME TRY.

12:17.237 --> 12:19.970
DONNA, LET ME HELP.

12:27.377 --> 12:29.379
OKAY. LET'S TRY.

12:29.379 --> 12:32.152
LET'S... OKAY.

12:32.152 --> 12:34.184
GOOD. OKAY.

12:34.184 --> 12:37.157
HE COULD NOT WAKE UP.

12:37.157 --> 12:40.490
HE COULD... WAKE UP...

12:40.490 --> 12:42.963
AND NEVER BE ABLE
TO MOVE AGAIN.

12:42.963 --> 12:44.264
HE COULD GO BLIND.

12:44.264 --> 12:47.337
HE COULD LOSE HIS ABILITY
TO SPEAK OR TO EAT.

12:47.337 --> 12:49.339
HE COULD REQUIRE
AROUND-THE-CLOCK CARE

12:49.339 --> 12:51.341
FOR THE REST OF HIS LIFE.

12:51.341 --> 12:54.144
HE COULD BE
IN A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF PAIN

12:54.144 --> 12:56.146
FOR THE REST OF HIS LIFE.

12:56.146 --> 12:58.448
HE COULD DIE ON THE TABLE.

12:58.448 --> 13:01.381
IF THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN,
IF NONE OF THOSE THINGS HAPPEN,

13:01.381 --> 13:03.383
HE'S STILL FACING MONTHS

13:03.383 --> 13:07.187
OF EXCRUCIATINGLY PAINFUL
RECOVERY FROM THIS SURGERY.

13:07.187 --> 13:09.189
AND BEFORE
YOU MAKE A DECISION,

13:09.189 --> 13:11.491
YOU NEED TO UNDERSTAND
THE RISKS.

13:19.970 --> 13:21.271
MM-HMM.

13:21.271 --> 13:23.273
YOU'RE DRIVING AWFULLY FAST,
DR. SHEPHERD.

13:23.273 --> 13:26.276
THE LEAST YOU COULD DO
IS WEAR A SEAT BELT.

13:36.046 --> 13:38.118
YOU'VE BEEN WORKING.

13:38.118 --> 13:40.290
IN THE CLINIC, IN THE PIT.

13:40.290 --> 13:42.292
WE HAVEN'T BEEN ALLOWED
TO OPERATE,

13:42.292 --> 13:45.225
WHICH MAKES ZERO SENSE
IF YOU ASK ME.

13:45.225 --> 13:50.300
I'D LIKE TO, UH, TALK TO YOU
ABOUT THE INCIDENT LAST WEEK.

13:52.102 --> 13:54.264
SHE'S NOT MY RESPONSIBILITY.

13:54.264 --> 13:56.206
SHE WAS YOUR GIRLFRIEND.
WELL, SHE'S NOT ANYMORE.

13:56.206 --> 13:58.208
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

13:58.208 --> 14:00.440
(indistinct conversations)

14:00.440 --> 14:03.143
KAREV,
GIVE ME ANOTHER SUTURE.

14:03.143 --> 14:05.175
MY PATIENT
DIDN'T BRING HER MEDS.

14:05.175 --> 14:07.177
SHE DOESN'T EVEN KNOW
THEIR NAMES.

14:07.177 --> 14:09.419
I-IF I GIVE HER ALBUTEROL
AND SHE'S ON PROPANOLOL,

14:09.419 --> 14:11.521
THEN SHE'LL STOP BREATHING.
IF--IF I GIVE HER WARFARIN

14:11.521 --> 14:14.454
AND SHE'S ON IBUPROFEN, THEN
SHE'LL--THEN SHE'LL BLEED OUT.

14:14.454 --> 14:16.526
IF I GIVE HER DIPHENHYDRAMINE
AND SHE'S ON DOXEPIN,

14:16.526 --> 14:20.030
THEN SHE'LL DIE. SO DO--DO--DO
YOU THINK SHE WANTS TO DIE?
IS SHE KIDDING?

14:20.030 --> 14:23.063
KAREV, WHAT'S GOING ON
OVER THERE?
I THINK THAT SHE WANTS TO DIE.

14:23.063 --> 14:25.065
I THINK
SHE WANTS ME TO KILL HER.

14:25.065 --> 14:28.168
DO--DO YOU--DO YOU--
DO YOU WANT ME TO KILL YOU?

14:28.168 --> 14:30.140
BECAUSE YOU--
YOU COULD JUST GET A GUN,

14:30.140 --> 14:32.272
AND IT WOULD BE A LOT FASTER.
KAREV, GET HER OUTTA HERE.

14:32.272 --> 14:35.305
YOU KNOW WHAT? SO WHY DOESN'T
SOMEBODY FIND A GUN...
(clattering)

14:35.305 --> 14:37.978
AND WE'LL BRING HER A GUN
AND JUST SHOOT HER...
KAREV, HELP HER.

14:37.978 --> 14:40.050
I CAN'T STEP AWAY.
GET HER OUT OF HERE!
'CAUSE SHE OBVIOUSLY
WANTS TO DIE!

14:40.050 --> 14:42.282
HELP! SOMEBODY FIND HER A GUN
'CAUSE SHE WANTS TO DIE!
I GOT MY OWN STUFF TO DO.

14:42.282 --> 14:43.954
SOMEBODY FIND SOMETHING!

14:43.954 --> 14:46.256
WHY DID YOU WALK AWAY?

14:46.256 --> 14:48.258
LOOK, LIFE IS TOO SHORT.

14:48.258 --> 14:50.260
I ALMOST DIED
TRYING TO STOP THAT GUY.

14:50.260 --> 14:52.262
BESIDES, I MEAN...

14:52.262 --> 14:54.264
YOU KNOW HOW MUCH TAIL
YOU GET OFFERED

14:54.264 --> 14:57.267
WHEN YOU'RE CARRYING
A BULLET AROUND IN YOUR CHEST?

14:57.267 --> 14:59.369
IT'S LIKE I'M A LEGEND.

14:59.369 --> 15:02.902
ARE YOU, UH...
ALWAYS THIS CRASS,

15:02.902 --> 15:05.305
OR IS THAT
A DEFENSE MECHANISM?

15:05.305 --> 15:08.178
(pants)

15:10.340 --> 15:13.984
I'VE HAD TOO MUCH CRAZY
FOR ONE LIFETIME.

15:13.984 --> 15:16.416
(Mark) YOU CLEARED LEXIE GREY
FOR SURGERY?

15:16.416 --> 15:18.618
DR. SLOAN, I'M IN--
I'M IN SESSION.

15:18.618 --> 15:21.251
I HAD TO CHECK HER INTO PSYCH
LAST WEEK.

15:21.251 --> 15:23.994
I HAD TO COMMIT HER
AGAINST HER WILL!

15:23.994 --> 15:27.227
AND YOU JUST CLEAR HER
FOR SURGERY?

15:27.227 --> 15:30.100
WHAT THE HELL
KIND OF DOCTOR ARE YOU?

15:32.032 --> 15:34.304
IT'S OKAY.
YOU CAN TALK TO HIM.

15:34.304 --> 15:38.138
I'LL COME BACK.
(Mark) YEAH, WALK AWAY.

15:38.138 --> 15:40.170
YOU'RE GOOD AT THAT.

15:42.973 --> 15:44.274
SHE GOT SNOWED.

15:44.274 --> 15:48.448
PSYCH PUT HER ON HEAVY DOSES
OF ANTIPSYCHOTICS AND BENZOS.

15:48.448 --> 15:51.421
AND THEN SHE SLEPT
FOR ALMOST 50 HOURS STRAIGHT.

15:51.421 --> 15:53.123
WHEN SHE WOKE UP,

15:53.123 --> 15:56.126
SHE WAS NO LONGER A RISK
TO HERSELF OR OTHERS.

15:56.126 --> 15:59.089
I MEAN, SHE HAS P.T.S.D.
MOST OF YOU DO.

15:59.089 --> 16:01.361
FOR HER, IT CAUSED
SEVERE SLEEP DEPRIVATION

16:01.361 --> 16:03.333
AND LED TO A BREAKDOWN.

16:03.333 --> 16:05.535
ALL SHE NEEDED WAS SLEEP.

16:05.535 --> 16:08.238
SO PROTOCOL IS
THAT SHE GOES BACK TO WORK.

16:08.238 --> 16:09.299
SEE?

16:09.299 --> 16:12.002
I'M OKAY.

16:12.002 --> 16:15.175
REALLY. I'M BACK.

16:17.677 --> 16:19.509
CLAMP.

16:19.509 --> 16:22.682
SO HOW ARE YOU?
I HEAR THERE'S A GUY.

16:22.682 --> 16:24.184
YEAH, THERE'S A GUY.

16:24.184 --> 16:25.655

16:25.655 --> 16:27.657

(laughs)

16:27.657 --> 16:30.160
I NEED ANOTHER CLAMP.

16:30.160 --> 16:33.163
SO... YOU'RE GETTING MARRIED.

16:33.163 --> 16:35.595
I AM.
I AM GETTING MARRIED.

16:35.595 --> 16:38.428
I'M HAPPY FOR YOU.

16:40.170 --> 16:41.471

16:41.471 --> 16:43.333

16:48.238 --> 16:50.310
OH, THERE WILL BE
NO CHICKEN DANCE.

16:50.310 --> 16:53.543
AND IF YOU START A CONGA LINE,
I WILL PHYSICALLY THROW YOU OUT.

16:53.543 --> 16:55.685
(snickers)
I JUST WENT TO THE CAFETERIA,

16:55.685 --> 16:57.687
AND SOME NURSE CALLED ME REED

16:57.687 --> 16:59.719
AND THEN SAID,
"I THOUGHT YOU DIED."

16:59.719 --> 17:02.292
YEAH, YOU DON'T GO
TO THE CAFETERIA FOR LUNCH.

17:02.292 --> 17:05.525
THEY JUST POINT AND STARE.
IS THAT WHY
YOU DYED YOUR HAIR?

17:05.525 --> 17:08.258
THEY STARE BECAUSE
WE SHOULD'VE DIED.

17:08.258 --> 17:10.060

19:16.155 --> 19:17.887
AFTER I GOT SHOT, I, UH...

19:17.887 --> 19:19.929
(gasps)

19:19.929 --> 19:23.363
LIFE IS SHORT.

19:25.395 --> 19:28.398
SO NOW I THINK LESS AND...

19:28.398 --> 19:30.240
JUST DO.

19:30.240 --> 19:35.575
SO... FOR YOU,
THE SHOOTING WAS CLARIFYING?

19:42.252 --> 19:45.255
A L--A LOT OF PEOPLE DIED
IN THAT SHOOTING.

19:45.255 --> 19:47.417
I'M SAYING,
IN YOUR LIFE TODAY...

19:47.417 --> 19:49.859
A LOT OF PEOPLE DIED.

19:53.363 --> 19:56.566
(Derek) OH.

19:56.566 --> 19:58.368
UM...

19:58.368 --> 20:00.370

SOMETHING TO EAT.

20:00.370 --> 20:03.433

20:13.913 --> 20:16.486

20:17.987 --> 20:20.620

20:22.652 --> 20:26.396

YOU CLEARED ALEX KAREV,
WHO INSISTS ON

RUNNING AROUND THE HOSPITAL
WITH A BULLET IN HIS CHEST.
I KNOW WHO I'VE CLEARED.

21:50.680 --> 21:53.683
SO THEN WHY DON'T YOU TELL ME

22:12.962 --> 22:15.104
AND WHERE'S OWEN?
UM, I DON'T KNOW.

22:15.104 --> 22:18.107
I-I-I THINK HE'S STILL TALKING
TO THE POLICE.

22:18.107 --> 22:20.810
OKAY, NOT A WORD OF THIS
TO DEREK.

22:20.810 --> 22:23.112
YOU HAVE TO TELL OWEN
BECAUSE HE KNOWS.

22:23.112 --> 22:25.114
NOT A WORD.
OKAY.

22:25.114 --> 22:27.116

22:27.116 --> 22:28.978

22:28.978 --> 22:30.780
WELL, GO--GO--GO TELL THEM.

22:30.780 --> 22:33.453
GO--GO BACK TO THE HOSPITAL
AND TELL THEM RIGHT NOW.

22:33.453 --> 22:35.925
DON'T YOU WANT ME
TO STAY FOR THIS?

22:35.925 --> 22:37.927
NO, I WANT YOU TO GO.

22:37.927 --> 22:40.830
GO AND--AND MAKE SURE
NO ONE SAYS A WORD TO DEREK.

22:40.830 --> 22:43.132

23:23.102 --> 23:26.405
AND SHE ONLY WATCHES ME SLEEP
WHEN SOMETHING IS UP,

23:26.405 --> 23:28.407
AND I'M AFRAID
THAT SHE'S GONNA PROPOSE

23:28.407 --> 23:31.481
OR... START TALKING ABOUT
MAKING BABIES AGAIN,

23:31.481 --> 23:33.483
WHICH I'M--I'M OPEN TO,
HONESTLY,

23:33.483 --> 23:35.485
JUST NOT RIGHT NOW,
YOU KNOW?

23:35.485 --> 23:37.917
AND I CAN FEEL HER WATCHING ME,
AND IT IS SUCH HARD WORK

23:37.917 --> 23:40.149
TO KEEP MY EYES CLOSED,
BUT I KNOW THAT IF I OPEN THEM,

23:40.149 --> 23:43.152
THAT SOMETHING LOADED IS GONNA
COME OUT OF HER BEAUTIFUL MOUTH

23:43.152 --> 23:45.595
AND POP THE PRETTY PINK BUBBLE
THAT WE'VE BEEN FLOATING IN.

23:45.595 --> 23:47.827
YOU WANT TO POP THE BUBBLE.
I DON'T, THOUGH.

23:47.827 --> 23:50.129
BELIEVE ME. I'VE BEEN LIVING
IN THAT BUBBLE FOR YEARS.

23:50.129 --> 23:52.902
OH, NO. OWEN AND I?
WE'RE JUST FRIENDS, REALLY.

23:52.902 --> 23:55.905
FINALLY KNOWING THE TRUTH?
I DON'T REGRET THAT.

23:55.905 --> 23:59.569
MY BUBBLE IS SO PINK
AND SO... PRETTY.

23:59.569 --> 24:01.571

24:01.571 --> 24:03.442

FOR ME.

REINSTATED ME THIS MORNING.

24:11.150 --> 24:14.654

NO SELLER'S REMORSE?

24:17.126 --> 24:19.128

QUESTION YOUR JUDGMENT, BUT...

GO TO TWO A.A. MEETINGS A DAY.
