HOW MANY?

05:22.122 --> 05:23.657
JUST ONE.

05:23.657 --> 05:24.992
WHAT IS HE,
ANOTHER COP?

05:24.992 --> 05:28.796
NO. MATTER OF FACT,
HE'S A FRIEND OF YOURS.

05:28.796 --> 05:31.365
YOU'RE GOING
TO LIKE THIS JOB.

05:36.370 --> 05:38.472
HE WAS IN
MY BROTHER'S GANG.

05:38.472 --> 05:41.475
FIRST HE DROPPED
A DIME ON HIM...

05:42.743 --> 05:46.914
THEN HE RATTED HIM
TO THE COP THAT
BLEW HIM AWAY.

05:58.959 --> 06:00.694
HEY.

06:02.129 --> 06:04.398

07:33.554 --> 07:34.955
WHO YOU CALLING,
FRIEND?

07:34.955 --> 07:37.558
NO ONE.
I WASN'T CALLING NOBODY.

07:39.593 --> 07:41.995
SOMEHOW, I DON'T
BELIEVE YOU.

07:41.995 --> 07:44.097
OH, GOD! OH, NO!

08:12.025 --> 08:14.461
$100,000.

08:14.461 --> 08:18.799
50,000 NOW.
ICEMAN'S A GENEROUS GUY.

08:22.636 --> 08:26.039
I DON'T LIKE 100s.
I TOLD YOU THAT BEFORE.

08:29.276 --> 08:30.678
THIS IS THE GUY.

08:30.678 --> 08:33.346
THE BALANCE IS DUE
WHEN HE'S DUSTED,
UNDERSTAND?

08:33.346 --> 08:34.648
WE WANT HIM DEAD.

08:34.648 --> 08:36.884
YEAH, WHATEVER.
NO PROBLEM.

08:46.694 --> 08:48.962
POLICE! FREEZE!

08:49.963 --> 08:51.965

A STEP APART.

08:51.965 --> 08:54.367
I DON'T WANT ANYBODY
GETTING HURT,

08:54.367 --> 08:55.936
SO MOVE SLOW.

09:27.300 --> 09:28.769
SHIT!

09:36.644 --> 09:38.812
GET THE HELL
OUT OF HERE!

10:10.878 --> 10:12.880
CHRIST, YOU REALLY
TOASTED THAT GUY.

10:12.880 --> 10:14.481
I DIDN'T
TOAST THE GUY.

10:14.481 --> 10:17.484
I JUST SHOT HIM,
FOR CHRIST SAKE.

10:17.484 --> 10:19.486
CALM DOWN.
WE'LL FIND THE GUN.

10:19.486 --> 10:21.488
WE'VE GOT TO
DO THIS TOGETHER.

10:21.488 --> 10:23.490
I CHECKED
THE GUY'S LOCKER.

10:23.490 --> 10:25.893
SEEMS OK.
WORKS HERE AT THE TRACK.

10:25.893 --> 10:28.495
50 BUCKS IN HIS WALLET,
SUNGLASSES, KEYS,

10:28.495 --> 10:29.897
PROBABLY CAR OR APARTMENT.

10:29.897 --> 10:32.499
WE STILL HAVEN'T
FOUND HIS GUN YET.

10:32.499 --> 10:34.101
AW, SHIT.

10:34.101 --> 10:36.704
CATES TOOK DOWN
ONE OF THE LOCALS.

10:36.704 --> 10:38.706
A SLUG
HIT A GAS PUMP

10:38.706 --> 10:41.508
AND BURNED THE
BAD GUY TO A CRISP.

10:41.508 --> 10:44.712
JACK CLAIMS IT WAS
A RIGHTEOUS SHOOT.

10:50.117 --> 10:53.754
MAN, I HATE THESE
I.A.D. SCUMBAGS.

10:55.956 --> 10:58.325
BLAKE WILSON,
INTERNAL AFFAIRS.

10:59.760 --> 11:02.362
SEEMS LIKE I'M
ALWAYS RUNNING
INTO YOU, JACK.

11:02.362 --> 11:04.364
GIVE US A MINUTE,
FELLAS.

11:06.834 --> 11:09.236
WHAT DID
YOU DO NOW, JACK?

11:09.236 --> 11:12.239
I WAS ON A STAKEOUT,
GETTING REAL CLOSE--

11:12.239 --> 11:14.842
CLOSE? OH, HO,
THE ICEMAN, RIGHT?

11:14.842 --> 11:18.245
YEAH, THE ICEMAN.
I'M GOING TO NAIL
THESE GUYS.

11:18.245 --> 11:21.849
YOU PIN EVERY CASE
YOU CAN'T SOLVE
ON THE ICEMAN.

11:21.849 --> 11:24.251
THE BAY AREA'S
BIGGEST DRUG DEALER,
RIGHT?

11:24.251 --> 11:27.254
EXCEPT WE DON'T
HAVE ANY PRINTS
OR A DESCRIPTION.

11:27.254 --> 11:30.257
YOU'RE THE ONLY COP
WHO BELIEVES
THIS GUY EXISTS.

11:30.257 --> 11:32.860
I'LL TELL YOU
A LITTLE SECRET--

11:32.860 --> 11:34.261
THERE IS NO ICEMAN.

11:34.261 --> 11:37.264
SO LET'S
GET BACK TO
THE COLD FACTS HERE,

11:37.264 --> 11:39.867
BECAUSE
THIS IS REAL.
WHAT HAPPENED?

11:39.867 --> 11:42.069
I SAW AN EXCHANGE.
PROBABLE CAUSE.

11:42.069 --> 11:45.672
HE HAD A PIECE.
HE SHOT. I SHOT BACK.

11:45.672 --> 11:47.474
YOU GOT
THE BAD GUY'S GUN?

11:47.474 --> 11:51.411
IT'S GOT TO BE IN THERE
WITH THE ASHES AND SHIT.

11:56.116 --> 11:58.118
CRUISE,
WHAT DO YOU GOT?

11:58.118 --> 12:00.653
NOTHING MUCH.
JUST SOME BURNT METAL.

12:00.653 --> 12:02.722
MUST BE OFF THE PUMP.

12:02.722 --> 12:04.357
NO GUN?

12:04.357 --> 12:05.692
NO, NO GUN.

12:05.692 --> 12:07.995
LOOK, A COP
IS A GUY,

12:07.995 --> 12:10.697
AND A GUY SOMETIMES
STEPS ON HIS DICK.

12:10.697 --> 12:13.100
YOU THINK YOU WERE
PUSHING TOO HARD

12:13.100 --> 12:14.501
TRYING TO MAKE
SOMETHING WORK?

12:14.501 --> 12:17.437
WE'RE ON
THE SAME SIDE.
DID YOU STEP ON--

12:17.437 --> 12:21.741
DAMN IT, HE HAD A PIECE!
HE SHOT. I SHOT BACK.

12:21.741 --> 12:24.744
HAVE THE LAB BOYS
GO OVER EVERY INCH.

12:24.744 --> 12:27.747
IF THERE'S A GUN
HERE, I WANT IT.

12:27.747 --> 12:29.349
A BULLET.
SOMETHING. ANYTHING.

12:32.019 --> 12:33.620
SEE YOU AROUND,
JACK?

12:33.620 --> 12:34.955
YEAH.

13:09.890 --> 13:11.358
REGGIE HAMMOND.

13:32.913 --> 13:36.049
YOU MUST BE
A REAL DANGEROUS CONVICT.

13:40.053 --> 13:42.722
YOU MADE ME
MISS, COP.

13:42.722 --> 13:44.324
YOU LOOK GOOD, REGGIE.

13:47.060 --> 13:49.062
I AIN'T SEEN YOU
IN YEARS.

13:49.062 --> 13:50.730
THOUGHT YOU WAS
MY FRIEND.

13:50.730 --> 13:53.366
I'M SORRY.
I'VE BEEN BUSY.

13:53.366 --> 13:54.801
YEAH, ME, TOO.

13:54.801 --> 13:57.804
YOU MUST
BE DESPERATE
TO COME DOWN HERE.

13:57.804 --> 13:59.406
WHAT'S GOING ON?

13:59.406 --> 14:00.974
WELL, TIMES CHANGE.

14:00.974 --> 14:04.044
WELL, YOU LOST
A COUPLE OF POUNDS.

14:04.044 --> 14:05.512
QUIT DRINKING.

14:05.512 --> 14:06.914
DID THE WARDEN
PICK YOU

14:06.914 --> 14:09.316
TO TELL ME
MY SENTENCE
GOT YANKED UP

14:09.316 --> 14:11.051
ANOTHER FIVE YEARS
OR SOMETHING?

14:11.051 --> 14:13.120
RELAX. YOU'RE STILL
GETTING OUT TOMORROW.

14:13.120 --> 14:16.123
WHEN YOU DO, WE'VE
GOT ANOTHER JOB TO DO.

14:16.123 --> 14:18.125
WE DON'T HAVE
SHIT TO DO.

14:18.125 --> 14:21.128
JUST
GIVE ME MY MONEY
AND WALK AWAY, OK?

14:21.128 --> 14:23.130
I PLAYED
THAT COP SHIT ONCE.

14:23.130 --> 14:25.132
I JUST WANT
MY MONEY, PLEASE.

14:25.132 --> 14:27.534
IF YOU DON'T
HELP ME OUT,

14:27.534 --> 14:31.304
I'M NOT EVER
GOING TO GIVE YOU
YOUR MONEY BACK.

14:32.839 --> 14:34.341
YOU'RE FUCKING
WITH ME, RIGHT?

14:34.341 --> 14:35.408
NO.

14:35.408 --> 14:38.411
JACK, I GAVE YOU
THAT MONEY
IN GOOD FAITH

14:38.411 --> 14:41.014
BECAUSE YOU SAID
I COULD TRUST YOU.

14:41.014 --> 14:42.916
NOW I CAN'T
HAVE MY MONEY?

14:42.916 --> 14:45.518
YEAH, NOW YOU GOT
THE PICTURE, CONVICT.

14:54.461 --> 14:56.663
YOU SCREWED UP
THIS TIME, HAMMOND.

14:56.663 --> 14:57.931
IT WAS SELF-DEFENSE.

14:57.931 --> 14:59.132
NOBODY'S BUYING
THAT CRAP!

14:59.132 --> 15:02.135
I SERVED TWO YEARS
FOR A CRIME I DID.

15:02.135 --> 15:03.870
I NEVER FUCKING
DENIED THAT.

15:03.870 --> 15:06.273
BUT I SPENT FIVE
BULLSHIT YEARS HERE.

15:06.273 --> 15:08.008
I NEVER
ROBBED NO PAYROLL.

15:08.008 --> 15:10.443
MURDERERS IN HERE DO
LESS TIME THAN ME.

15:10.443 --> 15:13.613
YOU CAN SPEND
YOUR REMAINING TIME
IN ISOLATION.

15:13.613 --> 15:14.948
OPEN UP.

15:45.545 --> 15:48.415

15:48.415 --> 15:52.885

PUT ON A RED LIGHT *

15:52.885 --> 15:54.521
* THOSE DAYS ARE OVER *

15:54.521 --> 15:56.889
* YOU DON'T HAVE
TO SELL YOUR BODY *

15:56.889 --> 15:58.658
* TO THE NIGHT *

15:58.658 --> 16:00.960
* ROXANNE **

16:39.966 --> 16:41.668
TEQUILA.

16:41.668 --> 16:43.103

16:50.043 --> 16:51.411
YOU GUYS
WANT ANYTHING?

16:51.411 --> 16:54.281
WHISKEY.
PUT IT IN A GLASS.

16:56.149 --> 16:59.386
MR. PRICE, THE MAN
IS DISTRESSED.

16:59.386 --> 17:02.989
THAT MESS YOU MADE
IN THE DESERT
HAS HIM WONDERING

17:02.989 --> 17:05.592
IF YOU'LL BE AROUND
TO FINISH THE JOB.

17:05.592 --> 17:07.127
NOT TO WORRY.

17:08.761 --> 17:10.163
REAL PROS, HUH?

17:10.163 --> 17:11.564
NOT FROM WHERE
I'M SITTING.

17:11.564 --> 17:14.767
PROS DON'T
MAKE MESSES
LIKE YOU DID.

17:14.767 --> 17:16.569
DON'T GET THE HEAT
JACKED UP

17:16.569 --> 17:18.271
WHEN YOU'RE
DOING A JOB.

17:18.271 --> 17:21.340
YOU WANT TO BE AN OUTLAW
BUT PLAY BY RULES.

17:21.340 --> 17:22.909
THERE AIN'T NO RULES.

17:22.909 --> 17:24.711
YOU GIVING ME
YOUR PHILOSOPHY?

17:24.711 --> 17:28.315
THAT'S RIGHT, BRO.
WE'RE THE ONLY
REAL AMERICANS LEFT.

17:28.315 --> 17:29.916
WE BELIEVE IN FREEDOM.

17:29.916 --> 17:32.319
WE LIVE THE WAY
FOLKS USED TO,

17:32.319 --> 17:35.388
BACK BEFORE THERE WERE
BIG CITIES AND LAWYERS

17:35.388 --> 17:37.990
AND COMPUTERS
WITH YOUR NAMES IN THEM.

17:37.990 --> 17:39.392
FREE. THE REST OF YOU

17:39.392 --> 17:42.395
ARE JUST A BUNCH
OF FUCKING SLAVES.

17:42.395 --> 17:45.398
YEAH? THAT SOUNDS
REAL INTERESTING,
MR. PRICE.

17:45.398 --> 17:47.800
MAYBE YOU SHOULD
RUN FOR OFFICE.

17:47.800 --> 17:50.803
ALL I'M
SUPPOSED TO TELL YOU
IS TAKE PRECAUTIONS.

17:50.803 --> 17:54.307
YOUR BACKUP
GOT BARBECUED
AT A RACE TRACK.

17:54.307 --> 17:57.677
YOU KNOW WHAT TO DO
WITH THAT STUFF.

17:57.677 --> 17:59.646
NO PROBLEM HERE, FRIEND.

17:59.646 --> 18:01.714
I USED TO BE A MARINE.

TROUBLE, YOU COME TO ME.

YOU KNOW THE NUMBER.

18:11.391 --> 18:13.826
HEY. HEY, COME HERE.

18:17.597 --> 18:21.601

18:29.209 --> 18:30.443
NAME'S ANGEL.

18:30.443 --> 18:32.312
ANGEL DON'T
WORK HERE ANYMORE.

HOW ABOUT YOU?

18:36.183 --> 18:38.585
I'M GETTING TIRED

OTHERWISE,
I'LL CALL THE COPS.

34:33.839 --> 34:34.840
YOU FUCKED ME.

34:34.840 --> 34:36.308
I FUCKED YOU?

34:36.308 --> 34:37.708
YOU FUCKED YOURSELF.

34:37.708 --> 34:40.246
YOU STOLE THE PAYROLL
AT THE PRISON.

34:40.246 --> 34:42.581
THEY FOUND THE MONEY
IN YOUR CELL.

34:42.581 --> 34:44.183
MOTHERFUCKER,
I GOT FRAMED.

34:44.183 --> 34:46.618
SOME CONVICT GOT A GUARD
TO OPEN THE CELL,

34:46.618 --> 34:49.121
PUT THE MONEY
UNDER THE PILLOW
LIKE THE TOOTH FAIRY.

34:49.121 --> 34:52.324
YOU GOT FRAMED?
THAT'S WHAT EVERY
CONVICT SAYS.

34:52.324 --> 34:55.226
THEY NEVER FOUND THAT
GUY'S GUN AT THE RACE TRACK.

34:55.226 --> 34:56.228
THAT'S DIFFERENT.

34:56.228 --> 34:57.829
WHAT'S DIFFERENT
ABOUT THAT?

34:57.829 --> 34:59.165
I'M A COP.
YOU'RE A CROOK.

34:59.165 --> 35:02.100
JUST BECAUSE
I'M A CONVICT,
I'M A LIAR?

35:02.100 --> 35:03.169
THAT'S RIGHT.

35:03.169 --> 35:04.670
SO JUST SCREW
REGGIE HAMMOND!

35:04.670 --> 35:05.471
THAT'S RIGHT.

35:05.471 --> 35:06.738
JUST TAKE ME TO MY CAR.

35:06.738 --> 35:07.806
I'M THROUGH WITH YOU.

35:07.806 --> 35:08.940
YOUR ARM HURT?

35:08.940 --> 35:10.041
YEAH. THANKS
TO YOUR FRIENDS.

35:10.041 --> 35:11.042
HURT BAD?

35:11.042 --> 35:12.043
YEAH.

35:12.043 --> 35:12.944
GOOD.

35:12.944 --> 35:14.346
YOU HEAR THE NEWS?

35:14.346 --> 35:17.216
WE GOT A PROBLEM
HERE, SLICK.

35:17.216 --> 35:18.584
HEY, MAN, BACK UP.

35:18.584 --> 35:20.319
I DIDN'T HIRE
THESE HILLBILLIES,

35:20.319 --> 35:22.721
SO DON'T COMPLAIN TO ME.

35:22.721 --> 35:26.024
YES.
PLAN B.

35:26.024 --> 35:27.426
WE GOT AN EX-MARINE
ON THE CASE.

35:27.426 --> 35:30.729
ONLY PROBLEM IS,
HE'S A HILLBILLY, TOO.

35:30.729 --> 35:31.730
YEAH.

35:31.730 --> 35:32.731
RIGHT.

35:32.731 --> 35:34.166
LATER.

35:43.041 --> 35:45.244
HOW MUCH OF MY MONEY
DID YOU SPEND?

35:45.244 --> 35:46.645
ABOUT 25 GRAND.

35:46.645 --> 35:49.047
YOU SAID I COULD
BUY A NEW CAR.

35:49.047 --> 35:50.449
WELL, WHERE IS IT?

35:50.449 --> 35:52.251
THIS HERE'S
THE NEW CAR.

35:52.251 --> 35:56.788
THIS LOOKS LIKE
THE SAME SHITTY SKY-BLUE
CADILLAC YOU HAD BEFORE.

35:56.788 --> 35:59.658
I BOUGHT THE SAME
MODEL, YEAR, COLOR,
EVERYTHING THE SAME.

35:59.658 --> 36:01.893
I GET ATTACHED
TO THINGS, REGGIE.

36:01.893 --> 36:02.928
YOU GOT THE SAME CAR?

36:02.928 --> 36:03.929
YEAH.

36:03.929 --> 36:05.030
SAME CLOTHES.

36:05.030 --> 36:06.698
YOU GOT
THE SAME GIRL, TOO?

36:06.698 --> 36:07.633
ELAINE?

36:07.633 --> 36:10.836
I DON'T WANT TO TALK
ABOUT THIS SHIT.

36:10.836 --> 36:12.271
KEEP IT ALL BALLED UP.

36:12.271 --> 36:15.274
SHE MARRIED ME
ABOUT FIVE YEARS AGO.

36:15.274 --> 36:18.410
DROVE ME TO CITY HALL
FOR A QUICK CEREMONY.

36:18.410 --> 36:20.812
SHE FIGURED
SHE'D SETTLE ME DOWN.

36:20.812 --> 36:24.416
THIS IS WHERE WE LIVED
TILL WE SPLIT UP.

36:24.416 --> 36:26.385
SHE MOVED UP
TO MILL VALLEY.

36:26.385 --> 36:27.886
I'VE BEEN
TRYING TO SELL IT.

36:27.886 --> 36:30.088
12 GRAND OF YOURS WENT
FOR THE DOWN PAYMENT.

36:30.088 --> 36:32.691
HOW COULD YOU LEAVE
MY CAR OUTSIDE
ALL THESE YEARS?

36:32.691 --> 36:35.026
WHY DIDN'T YOU PUT IT
IN THE GARAGE?

36:35.026 --> 36:36.595
WHAT IF SOMEBODY
STOLE IT?

36:36.595 --> 36:39.598
I HAD AN ALARM
PUT IN IT.

36:39.598 --> 36:40.799
JUST PUSH THAT
BLUE BUTTON THERE.

36:40.799 --> 36:43.735
YOU HAVE NO APPRECIATION
FOR WHAT'S HYPE.

36:43.735 --> 36:44.936
THAT CAR IS FLY.

36:44.936 --> 36:47.839
YOU KNOW
HOW MUCH PUSSY I GOT
BECAUSE OF THAT CAR?

36:57.883 --> 36:59.985
THEY BLEW UP MY CAR!

36:59.985 --> 37:01.753
THEY BLEW UP MY CAR!

37:01.753 --> 37:03.489
THEY BLEW UP MY CAR!

37:03.489 --> 37:05.223
THAT'S A DAMN SHAME.

37:05.223 --> 37:06.658
THEY BLEW UP MY CAR,

37:06.658 --> 37:09.261
AND ALL YOU
GOT TO SAY IS
IT'S A DAMN SHAME?

37:09.261 --> 37:12.163
NO CAR. NO MONEY.
YOU'RE HAVING A BAD DAY.

37:12.163 --> 37:14.266
THAT'S IT.
I'M THROUGH WITH YOU.

37:14.266 --> 37:16.134
I'M CALLING
SOME OF MY HOMIES.

37:16.134 --> 37:17.135
I'M GETTING A LOAN.

37:17.135 --> 37:18.870
I'M STEPPING
THE FUCK OFF.

37:27.178 --> 37:29.180
BUSTER!
HEY, WHAT'S UP, MAN?

37:29.180 --> 37:31.182
HOW YOU DOING?
REGGIE HAMMOND.

37:31.182 --> 37:32.584
YES, MY BROTHER!

37:32.584 --> 37:35.587
I'M OUT, MY MAN.
ON THE STREET AGAIN.

37:35.587 --> 37:37.889
YEAH. YEAH.
JUST COOL IT, BROTHER.

37:37.889 --> 37:39.291
NO, NO, NO. LISTEN.

37:39.291 --> 37:41.293
I'M GOING TO DO THAT.

37:41.293 --> 37:42.894
THAT'S WHAT
I'M CALLING ABOUT.

37:42.894 --> 37:44.029
I NEED A LOAN.

37:44.029 --> 37:46.698
I KNOW I OWE YOU
SOME SHIT,

37:46.698 --> 37:49.901
BUT I JUST
GOT OUT OF JAIL.

37:49.901 --> 37:50.702
JUST LISTEN.

37:50.702 --> 37:52.904
I DON'T HAVE
NO COLLATERAL.

37:52.904 --> 37:55.307
I JUST GOT OUT OF JAIL.

37:55.307 --> 37:58.310
WHAT THE FUCK
I NEED COLLATERAL FOR?

37:58.310 --> 37:59.311
HEY! HEY!

37:59.311 --> 38:01.179
HEY, BUSTER?

38:01.179 --> 38:02.548
BUSTER?

38:14.726 --> 38:16.495
JACK, WHAT
THE HELL'S GOING ON?

38:16.495 --> 38:17.663
WE GOT REPORTS
YOU WERE SHOT

38:17.663 --> 38:18.997
AND YOUR HOUSE BLEW UP.

38:18.997 --> 38:19.998
NO, A CAR.

38:19.998 --> 38:21.266
YOUR CAR BLEW UP?

38:21.266 --> 38:22.668
IT WASN'T MY CAR.

38:22.668 --> 38:25.270
IT WAS SOME
OTHER GUY'S CAR.

38:25.270 --> 38:27.272
ANYTHING COME IN
ON THOSE BIKERS?

38:27.272 --> 38:28.674
NOT YET.
I'LL CHECK AGAIN.

38:28.674 --> 38:31.142
DO ME A FAVOR
AND GO SEE WILSON.

38:31.142 --> 38:33.545
HE SAID IF YOU
DON'T SEE HIM,

38:33.545 --> 38:34.846
HE'LL SEND SOMEBODY
OUT TO GET YOU.

38:34.846 --> 38:35.947
SHIT.

38:38.249 --> 38:40.051
HEY, JACK. YOU OK?

38:53.198 --> 38:55.501
YOU GIVING
THAT GUY A TICKET?

38:55.501 --> 38:58.069
GOOD. HE HATES COPS.

38:58.069 --> 38:59.471
HE DOES, HUH?

38:59.471 --> 39:01.440
I RODE HERE WITH HIM.

39:01.440 --> 39:03.509
HE SAID COPS AIN'T SHIT.

39:03.509 --> 39:06.512
YOU WAS JUST PUSSIES
HIDING BEHIND YOUR BADGES.

39:06.512 --> 39:08.914
HE SAID
HE'LL PARK THIS CAR--

39:08.914 --> 39:10.582
HE DON'T CARE
IF IT'S A NO-PARKING ZONE.

39:10.582 --> 39:12.951
HE SAID TELL THE COP
TO KISS HIS ASS.

39:12.951 --> 39:14.119
SO KISS HIS ASS.

39:15.721 --> 39:18.524
YOUR FRIEND'S
NOT TOO SMART.

39:18.524 --> 39:19.758
YEAH. I KNOW.

39:19.758 --> 39:22.327
HE'S A BIG DUMB-ASS
COP NAMED JACK CATES.

39:22.327 --> 39:24.730
SHIT. TELL CATES
TO STOP PARKING

39:24.730 --> 39:27.065
IN FRONT
OF THE STATION.

39:34.973 --> 39:37.042
HELLO, JACK.

39:37.042 --> 39:39.778
FIRST THE MOTORCYCLE
TRACK, THEN THE DINER.

39:39.778 --> 39:42.781
NOW WE FOUND
A BOMB AT YOUR HOUSE?

39:42.781 --> 39:44.650
AND THE ICEMAN'S
RESPONSIBLE, RIGHT?

39:44.650 --> 39:47.653
I'M NOT GOING
TO ARGUE WITH YOU.

39:47.653 --> 39:49.521
I'M HERE
TO SUPPORT YOU.

39:49.521 --> 39:51.757
HOWEVER, AS SUPERVISOR
OF INTERNAL AFFAIRS,

39:51.757 --> 39:53.759
IT'S MY JOB TO TELL YOU

39:53.759 --> 39:55.360
YOU'RE STILL
ON SUSPENSION,

39:55.360 --> 39:58.363
AT LEAST UNTIL THE
COURT HEARING TOMORROW.

39:58.363 --> 40:01.366
SO WHY DON'T YOU
GIVE ME THAT GUN

40:01.366 --> 40:03.935
AND YOUR BADGE
AND POLICE I.D.?

40:03.935 --> 40:04.970
YEAH. RIGHT.

40:04.970 --> 40:09.441
I'LL BET YOU THINK
I ENJOY THIS, DON'T YOU?

40:12.110 --> 40:13.912
JACK, DO ME A FAVOR.

40:13.912 --> 40:16.815
GO HOME
AND GET SOME SLEEP.

40:18.917 --> 40:21.419
I GOT TO CHECK OUT
A FEW THINGS,

40:21.419 --> 40:23.421
MAKE OUT SOME REPORTS.

40:25.557 --> 40:28.560
I DON'T MIND PEOPLE
CHECKING UP ON COPS.

40:28.560 --> 40:31.563
I DON'T THINK
WE'RE ABOVE THE LAW.

40:31.563 --> 40:32.964
BUT MAKING COPS DO IT,

40:32.964 --> 40:34.099
IT'S BAD FOR MORALE.

40:34.099 --> 40:35.501
IT'S BAD FOR COPS.

40:35.501 --> 40:37.869
CIVILIANS OUGHT TO DO IT.

40:41.907 --> 40:43.274
YOU'RE A REAL
CHICKENSHIT, WILSON.

40:43.274 --> 40:46.512
BUT MAYBE
IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT.

40:46.512 --> 40:48.446
MAYBE IT'S YOUR JOB.

40:58.490 --> 40:59.858
ALL RIGHT.

41:22.981 --> 41:23.782
YO, MARVIN!

41:23.782 --> 41:25.216

41:36.828 --> 41:38.830
I JUST CAN'T

41:38.830 --> 41:41.833
I WAS THERE WHEN
YOU BEAT THE BITCH UP.

41:41.833 --> 41:43.434
NO. DON'T GET ME WRONG.

41:43.434 --> 41:44.836
I KNOW
YOU CAN FIND JESUS.

41:44.836 --> 41:46.437
EVERYBODY
CAN FIND JESUS.

41:46.437 --> 41:48.540
I LOVE JESUS.
I LOVE JESUS.

41:48.540 --> 41:50.141
I LOVE--HELLO?

41:50.141 --> 41:52.143

41:55.547 --> 41:57.849
BLACK MOTHERFUCKER.

42:02.588 --> 42:04.055

42:04.055 --> 42:07.826
13 COMPLAINTS
INVOLVING BIKERS
IN THE LAST FOUR DAYS.

42:07.826 --> 42:10.228
TWO TRAFFICS AND
A D AND D IN NORTH BEACH.

42:10.228 --> 42:12.230
RUN THEM
THROUGH THE NCIC.

42:12.230 --> 42:14.032
I'LL HAVE CRUISE DO IT.

42:14.032 --> 42:17.736
DON'T LOOK MUCH
LIKE A BIKER TO ME.

42:18.737 --> 42:20.238
NICE TALKING TO YOU.

42:23.775 --> 42:25.376
YOU STILL HERE?

42:25.376 --> 42:27.779
I DIDN'T THINK
YOU'D STICK AROUND.

42:27.779 --> 42:30.181
I'M NOT HAPPY
ABOUT BEING HERE.

42:30.181 --> 42:33.184
I'M SUPPOSED
TO BE A FREE MAN
WITH MONEY IN MY POCKET.

42:33.184 --> 42:36.354
I DON'T WANT TO BE TIED
TO YOUR WHITE ASS AGAIN.

42:36.354 --> 42:37.856
WELCOME BACK, REG.

42:37.856 --> 42:39.157
GET THE FUCK OFF ME.

42:39.157 --> 42:42.160
I AIN'T NO CONVICT.
I'M A FREE MAN.

42:42.160 --> 42:43.762
YOU'RE ALMOST WHERE
I WAS YESTERDAY.

42:43.762 --> 42:45.764
YOU AIN'T
RUNNING JACK SHIT.

42:45.764 --> 42:47.766
I AIN'T WORKING FOR YOU,

42:47.766 --> 42:49.901
I DON'T LIKE YOU,
AND I DON'T TRUST YOU.

42:49.901 --> 42:51.903
NOW JUST CUT
THE BULLSHIT.

42:51.903 --> 42:54.239
GIVE ME SOMETHING
I CAN USE, REGGIE.

42:54.239 --> 42:55.774
THE ICEMAN?

42:55.774 --> 42:58.343
THE ICEMAN
BOUGHT YOUR HOUSE.

42:58.343 --> 42:59.745
NOW GOD DAMN IT,

42:59.745 --> 43:01.412
I SAID
CUT THE BULLSHIT.

43:01.412 --> 43:03.915
I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU DIDN'T PUT THIS
TOGETHER YET.

43:03.915 --> 43:05.917
ME AND GANZ
ROBBED SOMEBODY

43:05.917 --> 43:07.352
FOR $500,000
A COUPLE YEARS BACK.

43:07.352 --> 43:08.486
THAT WAS THE ICEMAN.

43:08.486 --> 43:09.921
HE'S STILL PISSED OFF.

43:09.921 --> 43:12.523
AMAZING HOW MONEY
AFFECTS SOME PEOPLE.

43:12.523 --> 43:14.492
I SEE
YOUR WHEELS TURNING.

43:14.492 --> 43:16.895
THE MAN
YOU'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR

43:16.895 --> 43:18.897
BOUGHT
YOUR FUCKED-UP CAR

43:18.897 --> 43:21.566
AND PUT A DOWN PAYMENT
ON YOUR HOUSE.

43:21.566 --> 43:24.169
YOU'RE RIDING IN HIS CAR
LOOKING FOR HIM,

43:24.169 --> 43:27.438
WHICH MAKES YOU
THE DUMBEST MOTHERFUCKER
IN LAW ENFORCEMENT.

43:27.438 --> 43:29.474
GET IN THE CAR.
I'M DRIVING.

43:29.474 --> 43:30.742
YOU GOT
A FUCKED-UP ARM.

43:30.742 --> 43:31.943
I'M NOT GETTING
IN ANOTHER WRECK.

43:31.943 --> 43:35.213
I, UNLIKE YOU,
HAVE A LOT TO LIVE FOR.

43:40.085 --> 43:42.821
I ALWAYS WANTED
A CHAUFFEUR, REGGIE.

43:44.189 --> 43:47.793
I RECOGNIZED ONE
OF THOSE BIKERS
THAT ATTACKED THE BUS.

43:47.793 --> 43:50.428
HIS NAME IS CHERRY GANZ.
HE'S GANZ' BROTHER.

43:50.428 --> 43:51.496
GANZ' BROTHER?

43:51.496 --> 43:53.899
HE MAKES GANZ
LOOK LIKE GANDHI.

43:53.899 --> 43:56.167
WHY WOULD THE ICEMAN
HIRE GANZ' BROTHER?

43:56.167 --> 43:58.569
I RATTED GANZ TO YOU,
AND YOU KILLED GANZ.

43:58.569 --> 44:00.071
WHO'D WANT
TO KILL US MORE?

44:00.071 --> 44:02.507
GANZ SAID HIS BROTHER
FUCKED THIS BITCH
NAMED ANGEL.

44:02.507 --> 44:05.777
HE SAID HOW INSANE
THE PUSSY WAS.

44:05.777 --> 44:07.913
SAID THE BITCH
WORKED AT BARNSTORMERS.

44:07.913 --> 44:10.581
A COUPLE BIKERS
ROUSTED A BAR
CALLED BARNSTORMERS.

44:10.581 --> 44:13.785
THE COPS ARE
ACTUALLY CONTRIBUTING
TO THIS INVESTIGATION?

44:13.785 --> 44:15.286
I'M SHOCKED.

44:15.286 --> 44:18.289
HOW DO YOU REMEMBER
WHERE THIS GIRL WORKS

44:18.289 --> 44:19.624
AFTER SEVEN YEARS
IN PRISON?

44:19.624 --> 44:21.426
AFTER SEVEN YEARS
IN PRISON,

44:21.426 --> 44:24.796
YOU REMEMBER EVERY STORY
ABOUT PUSSY, TRUST ME.

44:32.070 --> 44:34.873

44:36.274 --> 44:37.275
HEY, JACK...

44:37.275 --> 44:39.144

44:39.144 --> 44:41.012
PEOPLE DON'T KNOW
THE DIFFERENCE

44:41.012 --> 44:42.147
WHEN YOU FLASH IT FAST.

44:42.147 --> 44:44.149
SOMEBODY SPOOKS

44:44.149 --> 44:46.752
AND YOU GET
YOUR ASS WHIPPED,

44:46.752 --> 44:47.819

45:37.535 --> 45:42.707

45:42.707 --> 45:45.110
CALL THE NEWS.
COP FINALLY RESPONDED.

45:45.110 --> 45:47.112
IT'S ONLY BEEN

45:47.112 --> 45:49.014
ARE YOU GOING
TO TALK OR BITCH?

45:49.014 --> 45:51.950
YOU'RE NEVER HERE
WHEN SOMEBODY NEEDS YOU.

45:51.950 --> 45:54.352
CAN I HAVE
A SHOT OF STOLI?

45:54.352 --> 45:55.453

45:55.453 --> 45:56.454

45:56.454 --> 45:57.856
HEY. HOW YOU DOING?

45:57.856 --> 45:59.457

46:03.194 --> 46:05.230

I KNOW YOU, RIGHT?

46:13.338 --> 46:14.772
YEAH, YOU DO.

46:14.772 --> 46:16.241
YOU BROKE MY HEART ONCE.

46:16.241 --> 46:17.275
DID I?

46:17.275 --> 46:18.977
I'M NOT LETTING YOU
GET AWAY THIS TIME.

46:18.977 --> 46:20.578
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

46:20.578 --> 46:21.980
WE COULD TAKE MINE.

46:21.980 --> 46:24.883
I HAVE
TO POWDER MY NOSE.

46:37.562 --> 46:38.563
HEY!

46:38.563 --> 46:39.965
HEY, HOW YOU DOING?

46:39.965 --> 46:41.833
PRETTY GOOD.
HOW ARE YOU?

46:41.833 --> 46:42.968
ALL RIGHT.

46:42.968 --> 46:45.736
YOU EVER SEE
THOSE COMMERCIALS ON TV

46:45.736 --> 46:46.905

46:46.905 --> 46:48.974

46:48.974 --> 46:49.975
KARL MALDEN.

46:49.975 --> 46:51.609
THE BIG-ASS NOSE MAN.

46:51.609 --> 46:54.812
YOU SEE
THOSE COMMERCIALS
WHERE HE SHOWS

46:54.812 --> 46:56.381
PEOPLE GETTING
THEIR POCKETS PICKED?

46:58.649 --> 46:59.550
YEAH.

46:59.550 --> 47:00.651
SHIT!

47:00.651 --> 47:02.988
SHIT IS A GOOD WORD
TO SAY THERE.

47:02.988 --> 47:04.255
I CAN GET
YOUR MONEY BACK,

47:04.255 --> 47:05.523
BUT IT'S GOING
TO COST YOU.

47:05.523 --> 47:06.491
HOW MUCH?

47:06.491 --> 47:08.994
I THINK HALF YOUR MONEY
WOULD BE GOOD.

47:08.994 --> 47:10.528
GIVE ME A BREAK!

47:10.528 --> 47:11.562
I'M GIVING YOU A BREAK.

47:11.562 --> 47:12.864
YOU AIN'T
GOT NOTHING NOW.

47:12.864 --> 47:14.399
THE BITCH
IS COUNTING YOUR MONEY.

47:14.399 --> 47:16.601
SHE'S GOT
YOUR CREDIT CARDS,

47:16.601 --> 47:18.003
RUN YOUR RATES UP,

47:18.003 --> 47:19.704
YOUR CREDIT'S
GOING TO BE FUCKED UP.

47:19.704 --> 47:21.772
YOU GOT A DEAL.

47:21.772 --> 47:26.144
THE DARK-HAIRED GUY
ASKED ABOUT A GIRL
WHO WORKED HERE.

47:26.144 --> 47:27.845
HE STARTS GRABBING ME.

47:27.845 --> 47:30.615
THE BLOND ONE
PULLS OUT A GUN.

47:30.615 --> 47:32.317
WHAT ABOUT THIS GIRL?

47:32.317 --> 47:34.385
ANGEL STOP WORKING
HERE A YEAR AGO.

47:34.385 --> 47:36.854
SHE'S DANCING
AT THE BIRD CAGE.

47:36.854 --> 47:38.823
AREN'T YOU SUPPOSED
TO BE WRITING THIS DOWN?

47:38.823 --> 47:40.825
I GOT
A PHOTOGRAPHIC MEMORY.

47:40.825 --> 47:42.260
YOU GOT HER ADDRESS?

47:59.144 --> 48:00.745
THIS IS
THE LADIES' ROOM.

48:00.745 --> 48:01.947
YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED
TO BE HERE.

48:01.947 --> 48:03.581
MIND YOUR
OWN BUSINESS.

48:05.583 --> 48:06.617
HEY.

48:06.617 --> 48:09.354
I THOUGHT THIS
WOULD BE A GOOD TIME

48:09.354 --> 48:10.956
FOR US TO GET
TO KNOW EACH OTHER.

48:10.956 --> 48:13.358
YOU'RE VERY SMOOTH.
VERY, VERY SMOOTH.

48:13.358 --> 48:16.361
I'VE SEEN A LOT
OF POCKETS PICKED,

48:16.361 --> 48:17.895
BUT NO ONE
AS SMOOTH AS YOU.

48:17.895 --> 48:19.364
I WAS TALKING
TO THE GUY YOU HIT.

48:19.364 --> 48:20.465
HE'S UPSET.

48:20.465 --> 48:23.901
I TOLD HIM I'D GET
HALF HIS MONEY BACK.

48:23.901 --> 48:27.305
THAT IS, UNLESS YOU
OFFER ME A LITTLE BRIBE.

48:27.305 --> 48:30.608
THEN I'LL TELL HIM YOU
WERE TOO FAST FOR ME.

48:30.608 --> 48:33.578
I AM
TOO FAST FOR YOU.

48:39.850 --> 48:42.087
HI. ALMOST FINISHED.

48:47.658 --> 48:49.660
WAS ANYBODY
ELSE WITH THEM?

48:49.660 --> 48:50.895
NO. JUST THE
THREE OF THEM.

48:50.895 --> 48:52.697
THERE WAS
THIS BLACK GUY.

48:52.697 --> 48:56.467
THE OLDEST ONE
WAS TALKING
TO A BLACK GUY.

48:56.467 --> 48:57.868
A BLACK GUY, HUH?

48:57.868 --> 48:59.870
WAS IT
SOMETHING LIKE THIS?

48:59.870 --> 49:01.406
YEAH. YEAH,
THAT'S HIM.

49:01.406 --> 49:02.873
HE WAS OK.

49:02.873 --> 49:04.275
HE DIDN'T
BOTHER ME.

49:04.275 --> 49:06.277
IF THEY COME IN AGAIN,

49:06.277 --> 49:08.279
CALL DOWN
TO THE DEPARTMENT.

49:08.279 --> 49:10.881
YOU ASK FOR
INSPECTOR BEN KEHOE.

49:10.881 --> 49:12.550
HE'LL KNOW WHAT TO DO.

49:13.584 --> 49:16.121
YOU'RE LUCKY.
HERE'S HALF YOUR MONEY.

49:16.121 --> 49:17.855
WHAT ABOUT MY CREDIT CARDS?

49:17.855 --> 49:19.257
WE HAD
NO CREDIT CARD DEAL.

49:19.257 --> 49:22.560
YOUR CARDS ARE STILL
IN THE BATHROOM.

49:26.264 --> 49:29.200
* GOT TO GIVE IT
ALL YOU GOT *

49:29.200 --> 49:30.568
* TILL YOU DROP *

49:37.908 --> 49:41.712
* NOW SOMETIMES YOU WIN *

49:41.712 --> 49:43.981
* SOMETIMES YOU LOSE *

49:43.981 --> 49:44.982
JACK CATES?

49:44.982 --> 49:47.718
REMEMBER ME?

49:47.718 --> 49:49.354
NAH. I DON'T THINK SO.

49:49.354 --> 49:52.157
YOU BUSTED ME IN
A CAMARO WITH A GIRL.

49:52.157 --> 49:54.159
THAT DON'T
SOUND LIKE ME.

49:54.159 --> 49:56.161
TURNS OUT
SHE WAS UNDERAGE,

49:56.161 --> 49:57.695
BUT I DIDN'T
KNOW IT.

49:57.695 --> 49:58.696
SHIT HAPPENS.

49:58.696 --> 50:00.498
MY BUDDY
STOLE THE CAR.

50:00.498 --> 50:03.101
MAYBE YOU BETTER PICK
BETTER BUDDIES.

50:03.101 --> 50:05.103
I GOT TO SEE SOMEBODY.

50:05.103 --> 50:06.704
I GOT TWO YEARS.

50:06.704 --> 50:08.106
GIVE ME A BREAK.

50:08.106 --> 50:09.340
I DON'T WANT
TO GET IN A BAR FIGHT.

50:09.340 --> 50:11.576
PEOPLE ARE ALWAYS
GETTING IN BAR FIGHTS.

50:11.576 --> 50:12.977
IT'S A DAMN CLICHE.

50:12.977 --> 50:14.979
YOU ALWAYS
HEAR ABOUT IT.

50:14.979 --> 50:16.814
YOU SEE IT IN MOVIES.

50:16.814 --> 50:19.350
PEOPLE GET HIT
IN THE HEAD

50:19.350 --> 50:22.187
WITH BEER BOTTLES
AND FURNITURE.

51:16.307 --> 51:19.844
I'M TAKING TWO YEARS
OUT OF YOUR ASS, CATES!

51:19.844 --> 51:21.246
YOU GOT A GUN?

51:21.246 --> 51:23.148
IN CASE THEY STICK
THE PLACE UP.

51:34.625 --> 51:36.026
ALL RIGHT.

51:36.026 --> 51:38.996
KNOCK THIS SHIT OFF.

51:38.996 --> 51:41.999
I'VE BEEN HAVING
A VERY BAD DAY.

51:41.999 --> 51:44.101
I JUST GOT OUT OF JAIL
THIS MORNING.

51:44.101 --> 51:46.103
ALREADY
I'VE BEEN SHOT AT,

51:46.103 --> 51:49.440
MY BUS FLIPPED OVER
17 TIMES,

51:49.440 --> 51:51.909
A BITCH TRIED TO STAB ME
IN THE BATHROOM,

51:51.909 --> 51:54.044
AND SOMEBODY
BLEW UP MY PORSCHE.

51:54.044 --> 51:56.046
I'M IN A BAD MOOD.

51:56.046 --> 51:57.715
I USUALLY DON'T JUMP IN

51:57.715 --> 51:59.284
WHEN SOMEBODY'S
GETTING BEAT DOWN,

51:59.284 --> 52:03.554
BUT THIS MAN
WILL HELP ME
STRAIGHTEN UP MY DAY.

52:03.554 --> 52:05.890
BACK UP AND LET US
GO ABOUT OUR BUSINESS.

52:05.890 --> 52:07.692
BECAUSE YOU
GOT A GUN?

52:07.692 --> 52:10.761
NO. BECAUSE
I HAVE A GUN AND
I'LL SHOOT YOU.

52:10.761 --> 52:14.499
I DON'T THINK YOU'VE GOT
THE GUTS TO USE IT.

52:21.439 --> 52:24.275
ANYBODY ELSE
WANT TO LIMP?

52:27.077 --> 52:28.479
SORRY ABOUT THE KNEECAP.

52:28.479 --> 52:30.415
I GOT A LITTLE EXCITED.

52:30.415 --> 52:33.418
YOU KNOW HOW
TO HANDLE AN INVESTIGATION.

52:33.418 --> 52:35.420
YOU DISAPPEARED.
WHERE WERE YOU?

52:35.420 --> 52:37.422
I WAS IN THE BATHROOM.

52:37.422 --> 52:38.989
THEN I GOT
TO SAVE YOUR ASS.

52:38.989 --> 52:40.391
I DIDN'T NEED YOU.

52:40.391 --> 52:41.792
I WAS PROTECTING MY MONEY.

52:41.792 --> 52:44.395
I SHOULDN'T
HAVE GONE IN THERE

52:44.395 --> 52:46.297
WITHOUT MY SPARE GUN.

52:46.297 --> 52:49.300
I GET INTO
A GOD DAMN BAR FIGHT.

52:49.300 --> 52:51.502
JACK,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

52:51.502 --> 52:53.003
HEY!

52:53.003 --> 52:54.405
WHAT WAS THAT FOR?

52:54.405 --> 52:57.007
FOR THE BASKETBALL.
NOW WE'RE EVEN.

52:57.007 --> 52:58.409
WE CAN START FRESH.

52:58.409 --> 53:01.212
I'VE GOT TO LEAVE,
OR I'LL DO A HOMICIDE.

53:01.212 --> 53:02.247
THE DEAL IS OFF.

53:02.247 --> 53:03.614
THE DEAL'S OFF, BULLSHIT.

53:03.614 --> 53:06.684
LET'S GO.
GET IN THE CAR.

53:06.684 --> 53:07.652
COME ON.

53:07.652 --> 53:10.855
DID YOU TAKE LESSONS
TO BE A SHITHEAD?

53:10.855 --> 53:12.857
I WAS JUST
GETTING EVEN.

53:12.857 --> 53:14.259
DON'T TAKE IT PERSONAL.

53:14.259 --> 53:16.861
I TOLD YOU
TO STAY AWAY.

53:16.861 --> 53:18.263
I MEAN IT.

53:18.263 --> 53:19.864
HEY, DON'T BE STUPID.

53:19.864 --> 53:21.266
WHERE YOU GOING?

53:21.266 --> 53:22.867
AWAY! AWAY FROM YOU.

53:22.867 --> 53:24.269
THAT'S WHERE I'M GOING.

53:24.269 --> 53:26.070
YOUR TIP TURNED OUT OK.

53:26.070 --> 53:31.609
GANZ' GIRL LIVES
IN THE TENDERLOIN
AT THE KING MEI HOTEL.

53:31.609 --> 53:32.810

53:34.211 --> 53:35.446
FUCK YOU, JACK.

53:38.783 --> 53:40.551

54:11.749 --> 54:14.285
ALL RIGHT.
I'LL BE RIGHT OVER.

54:14.285 --> 54:15.720
THEN WHY
IS HE ON THE STREETS?

54:15.720 --> 54:18.389
COMING TO THE STATION
AIN'T A GOOD IDEA.

54:18.389 --> 54:19.524
WILSON'S LOOKING FOR YOU.

54:19.524 --> 54:22.693
AW, CHRIST.
HE HEARD ABOUT THE BAR.

54:54.592 --> 54:57.995

CAPPED TWO CHIPs AND

54:57.995 --> 55:00.998
A SPECIAL INVESTIGATIONS

55:00.998 --> 55:03.901
THESE GUYS ARE ENFORCERS
FOR THEIR GANG,
THE BROTHERHOOD.

55:03.901 --> 55:07.104
THEY'VE BEEN LINKED
TO OVER 15 DEATHS.

55:07.104 --> 55:08.373
BRAKE! BRAKE!

55:10.074 --> 55:11.476
YOU GOT
ANYTHING ELSE?

55:11.476 --> 55:13.344
NAH. NOTHING HARD.

55:15.846 --> 55:18.449
JACK, JUST GO
AROUND THE BLOCK.

55:18.449 --> 55:19.717

55:36.601 --> 55:37.868
HEY, KIRK. WHAT'S UP?

55:37.868 --> 55:39.069

55:39.069 --> 55:42.940
LOOK, IT'S A LITTLE BIT
MORE COMPLICATED THAN THAT.

55:42.940 --> 55:44.341
DON'T MESS WITH ME.

55:44.341 --> 55:46.744
YOU AIN'T
A CITIZEN NO MORE.

55:46.744 --> 55:49.380
YOU CAN'T VOTE.
NOBODY WILL HIRE YOU.

55:49.380 --> 55:52.116
YOU'RE AN OUTCAST.
NOBODY WANTS YOU.

55:52.116 --> 55:54.118
ALL YOU GOT LEFT

55:54.118 --> 55:55.820
DON'T BREAK

01:11:36.826 --> 01:11:38.828
[GUNSHOTS]

01:11:52.141 --> 01:11:53.643
MALCOLM PRICE.

01:11:54.978 --> 01:11:57.581
MUST HAVE BEEN
A REAL GOOD LEAD, JACK.

01:11:57.581 --> 01:11:59.583
SOMEBODY SHOT HIM
16 TIMES.

01:11:59.583 --> 01:12:02.652
I'VE BEEN CHASING
THIS GOD DAMN ICEMAN
FOR YEARS.

01:12:02.652 --> 01:12:04.654
EVERY TIME I GET CLOSE,

01:12:04.654 --> 01:12:06.656
IT'S ANOTHER
GOD DAMN DEAD END.

01:12:06.656 --> 01:12:09.258
THIS JOB WILL
DRIVE YOU CRAZY.

01:12:09.258 --> 01:12:11.661
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.

01:12:11.661 --> 01:12:15.799
JACK,
THE ICEMAN'S A COP.

01:12:15.799 --> 01:12:16.833
NO WAY.

01:12:16.833 --> 01:12:20.604
COME ON, JACK. PUT
THE SHIT TOGETHER, MAN.

01:12:20.604 --> 01:12:22.005
JACK, THINK ABOUT IT.

01:12:22.005 --> 01:12:24.207
YOU CALLED
FOR PRICE'S ADDRESS.

01:12:24.207 --> 01:12:26.209
THE ICEMAN
SHOWS UP THERE FIRST.

01:12:26.209 --> 01:12:28.011
IT'S A COINCIDENCE.
BAD LUCK.

01:12:28.011 --> 01:12:31.615
WHAT ABOUT THE BROTHER
WHOSE PICTURE YOU'VE
BEEN SHOWING AROUND?

01:12:31.615 --> 01:12:33.282
GET ANY FEEDBACK
ON THAT?

01:12:33.282 --> 01:12:36.586
YOU GOT TO RUN
A MUG SHOT THROUGH NCIC.

01:12:36.586 --> 01:12:38.688
HOW LONG THAT TAKE?

01:12:38.688 --> 01:12:39.489
HOURS.

01:12:39.489 --> 01:12:41.057
IT'S BEEN HOURS.

01:12:41.057 --> 01:12:42.459
WELL, SOMETIMES
IT'S SLOW.

01:12:42.459 --> 01:12:44.561
THE ICEMAN
WANTS TO KILL ME.

01:12:44.561 --> 01:12:47.964
IT HAS NOTHING TO DO
WITH THE MONEY I TOOK.

01:12:47.964 --> 01:12:51.167
HE WANT TO KILL ME
BECAUSE I SEEN HIM.

01:12:51.167 --> 01:12:53.970
HE THINKS I CAN
BLOW HIS COVER.

01:12:53.970 --> 01:12:56.840
THE SAME GUY IS FUCKING
UP YOUR INVESTIGATION.

01:12:56.840 --> 01:12:59.709
WHO'S PUTTING UP
RESISTANCE 'CAUSE
YOU'RE ON THIS CASE?

01:12:59.709 --> 01:13:01.711
THAT IS
PROBABLY THE ICEMAN.

01:13:01.711 --> 01:13:04.748
ONLY GUY
IT COULD BE IS WILSON,

01:13:04.748 --> 01:13:07.751
AND THAT PRICK'S BEEN
DOGGING MY ASS FOR YEARS,

01:13:07.751 --> 01:13:10.487
EVER SINCE I STARTED
LOOKING FOR THE ICEMAN.

01:13:10.487 --> 01:13:11.855
ALL THROUGH THIS THING!

01:13:11.855 --> 01:13:14.257
I GOT TO GET YOU
TO THE HEARING.

01:13:14.257 --> 01:13:15.692
WHAT HEARING?

01:13:15.692 --> 01:13:19.663
THE ONE WHERE
THEY'RE GOING TO
TAKE AWAY MY BADGE.

01:13:19.663 --> 01:13:22.031
IT STARTED
TWO HOURS AGO.

01:13:22.031 --> 01:13:24.501
AFTER THE INCIDENT
IN THE MISSION DISTRICT,

01:13:24.501 --> 01:13:26.903
INSPECTOR CATES
DREDGED UP THIS THEORY

01:13:26.903 --> 01:13:29.639
OF A CRIMINAL MASTERMIND
RUNNING THE DRUG TRAFFIC

01:13:29.639 --> 01:13:31.240
IN THE BAY AREA.

01:13:31.240 --> 01:13:32.642
FOR FOUR YEARS,

01:13:32.642 --> 01:13:35.645
HE HAS WASTED DEPARTMENT
RESOURCES AND MANPOWER,

01:13:35.645 --> 01:13:38.114
RISKED OTHER OFFICERS' LIVES
TO VINDICATE HIS THEORIES.

01:13:38.114 --> 01:13:41.918
CAN YOU DESCRIBE
INSPECTOR CATES'
PROFESSIONAL ATTITUDE?

01:13:41.918 --> 01:13:44.921
WHEN A POLICE OFFICER
TAKES IT UPON HIMSELF

01:13:44.921 --> 01:13:46.523
TO VIOLATE
DEPARTMENT REGULATIONS

01:13:46.523 --> 01:13:47.924
AND SUSPECTS' CIVIL RIGHTS,

01:13:47.924 --> 01:13:50.927
IT MAKES IT HARD
ON EVERY GOOD COP

01:13:50.927 --> 01:13:53.930
OUT THERE TRYING
TO DO HIS JOB.

01:13:53.930 --> 01:13:57.333
THESE REMARKS
HAVE NOTHING TO DO
WITH THE INCIDENT.

01:13:57.333 --> 01:13:59.135
ON THE CONTRARY,
YOUR HONOR.

01:13:59.135 --> 01:14:02.138
I'M TRYING TO SHOW
A PATTERN OF BEHAVIOR

01:14:02.138 --> 01:14:05.241
THAT WILL ILLUMINATE EVENTS
AT HUNTER'S POINT RACEWAY.

01:14:05.241 --> 01:14:08.077
I'LL LET
THE TESTIMONY STAND.

01:14:28.097 --> 01:14:30.967
IN CONSIDERATION OF
THE PRELIMINARY EVIDENCE

01:14:30.967 --> 01:14:33.102
PRESENTED THUS FAR
BY THE STATE,

01:14:33.102 --> 01:14:35.739
AND IN ADHERENCE TO LAWS,
STATUTES, AND RULES

01:14:35.739 --> 01:14:37.741
SPECIFIED BY THE STATE
OF CALIFORNIA,

01:14:37.741 --> 01:14:39.242
CITY OF SAN FRANCISCO--

01:14:39.242 --> 01:14:40.476
THERE HE IS!

01:14:40.476 --> 01:14:43.279
ORDER! ORDER! LET'S
HAVE SOME ORDER HERE.

01:14:43.279 --> 01:14:45.214
THIS IS
AN OFFICIAL HEARING.

01:14:45.214 --> 01:14:47.216
NO, IT'S
SOME OTHER GUY.

01:14:47.216 --> 01:14:49.218
NO, NO, NO!
RIGHT THERE.

01:14:49.218 --> 01:14:50.620
THAT'S NOT HIM.

01:14:50.620 --> 01:14:51.688
THAT'S HIM.

01:14:51.688 --> 01:14:53.289
WHO ARE THESE MEN?

01:14:53.289 --> 01:14:55.358
THAT IS
INSPECTOR JACK CATES.

01:14:55.358 --> 01:14:56.760
THAT'S DEFINITELY
NOT THE GUY.

01:14:56.760 --> 01:14:58.762
THAT'S GOT
TO BE THE ICEMAN.

01:14:58.762 --> 01:15:02.331
YOU DON'T FORGET
SOMEBODY YOU TOOK
HALF A MILLION FROM.

01:15:02.331 --> 01:15:04.734
THAT'S GOT
TO BE THE ICEMAN!

01:15:04.734 --> 01:15:06.836
THIS IS TOO MUCH!

01:15:06.836 --> 01:15:11.040
THIS COURT RULES THAT
THERE IS SUFFICIENT EVIDENCE

01:15:11.040 --> 01:15:12.942
TO PROCEED WITH
A CRIMINAL TRIAL

01:15:12.942 --> 01:15:14.544
AGAINST INSPECTOR
JACK CATES.

01:15:14.544 --> 01:15:16.546
TRIAL DATE WILL BE SET

01:15:16.546 --> 01:15:18.948
FOR THE EARLIEST OPENING
ON THE COURT CALENDAR.

01:15:18.948 --> 01:15:20.984
THIS HEARING
IS ADJOURNED.

01:15:43.306 --> 01:15:45.675
ICEMAN
WHACKED OUT PRICE.

01:15:45.675 --> 01:15:47.944
YOU WANT
TO TALK ABOUT IT?

01:15:47.944 --> 01:15:51.147
NO CHOICE.
YOUR GIRL RATTED HIM
OUT TO THE COPS.

01:15:51.147 --> 01:15:52.148
BULLSHIT.

01:15:52.148 --> 01:15:53.549
I DON'T BULLSHIT.

01:15:53.549 --> 01:15:55.418
SHE WORKS
AS A DANCER,

01:15:55.418 --> 01:15:57.486
LIVES AT
THE KING MEI HOTEL.

01:15:57.486 --> 01:16:01.658
YOU SHOULD BE MORE
CAREFUL ABOUT WHO
YOU HANG OUT WITH.

01:16:01.658 --> 01:16:03.126
WHO PULLED THE TRIGGER?

01:16:03.126 --> 01:16:05.729
WHAT'S THE FUCKING
DIFFERENCE WHO
PULLED THE TRIGGER?

01:16:05.729 --> 01:16:07.731
THE COPS WERE
GETTING TOO CLOSE.

01:16:07.731 --> 01:16:10.333
THAT'S THE WAY THE
MAN DOES BUSINESS.

01:16:10.333 --> 01:16:11.735
BUSINESS,
NOT PERSONAL.

01:16:11.735 --> 01:16:13.002
YOU TWO FUCKING
HILLBILLIES

01:16:13.002 --> 01:16:14.470
SHOULD LEARN
THE DIFFERENCE.

01:16:14.470 --> 01:16:17.140
BUSINESS. YEAH.

01:16:18.274 --> 01:16:21.277
AAH!

01:16:22.345 --> 01:16:24.147
THAT'S BUSINESS, TOO.

01:16:33.757 --> 01:16:36.760
YOU HAPPY NOW,
ASSHOLE?

01:16:36.760 --> 01:16:40.764
THAT STILL DOESN'T
CHANGE THE JOB.

01:16:40.764 --> 01:16:43.166
YOU GOT TO KILL
REGGIE HAMMOND.

01:16:43.166 --> 01:16:44.934
HOW WILL WE DO THAT?

01:16:44.934 --> 01:16:47.070
KIRKLAND SMITH
KEPT REGGIE ALIVE

01:16:47.070 --> 01:16:49.472
WHEN WE HAD PAPERS
OUT ON HIM.

01:16:49.472 --> 01:16:53.276
REGGIE OWES HIM.
I FIGURED OUT WHERE
HE'LL PAY BACK.

01:16:53.276 --> 01:16:54.678
THE DUDE'S
GOT A DAUGHTER

01:16:54.678 --> 01:16:56.079
WORKS IN
A GOODWILL STORE

01:16:56.079 --> 01:16:58.081
IN THE HAIGHT
JUST OFF CENTRAL.

01:16:58.081 --> 01:17:00.083
WE'RE GOING
TO GET HAMMOND,

01:17:00.083 --> 01:17:03.753
THEN WE'RE GOING
TO GET THE COP
AND THE ICEMAN,

01:17:03.753 --> 01:17:06.222
AND WE'RE GOING
TO KILL THEM ALL.

01:17:06.222 --> 01:17:10.126
YOU JUST STICK TO
HAMMOND, JOE BOB.
THAT'S THE GIG.

01:17:11.961 --> 01:17:15.064
[TELEPHONE RINGS]

01:17:16.700 --> 01:17:19.235
I KEEP FORGETTING
THE COMBINATION.

01:17:20.469 --> 01:17:23.907
I DON'T WANT TO
SEE YOU CLEAR OUT
YOUR LOCKER.

01:17:23.907 --> 01:17:26.109
WE CAN GET THIS GUY.

01:17:34.951 --> 01:17:38.955
YOU KNOW, REGGIE,
I'VE BEEN A COP
FOR 20 YEARS,

01:17:38.955 --> 01:17:42.525
AND ALL I'VE BEEN
AROUND IS PIMPS,
MURDERERS, AND ROBBERS,

01:17:42.525 --> 01:17:46.329
BUT BETWEEN YOU AND ME,
I'VE ALWAYS BEEN STRAIGHT.

01:17:46.329 --> 01:17:48.965
NOW, YOU DID YOUR BEST.

01:17:50.033 --> 01:17:54.370
SO HERE'S YOUR 475 THOU.

01:18:04.547 --> 01:18:07.550
YOU KEPT MY MONEY
IN YOUR LOCKER?

01:18:07.550 --> 01:18:08.684
YEAH.

01:18:08.684 --> 01:18:10.219
IN A POLICE LOCKER?

01:18:10.219 --> 01:18:13.723
YEAH. HEY,
WE GOT NO MORE TIES.

01:18:13.723 --> 01:18:15.524
YOU'RE A FREE MAN, REG.

01:18:15.524 --> 01:18:21.197
LISTEN, MY ADVICE TO YOU
IS TAKE THIS MONEY
AND DISAPPEAR.

01:18:36.345 --> 01:18:38.748
YOU SURE, MAN?

01:18:38.748 --> 01:18:40.216
YEP.

01:18:43.686 --> 01:18:45.288
ALL RIGHT.

01:18:48.291 --> 01:18:49.725
ALL RIGHT.

01:19:06.642 --> 01:19:09.245
THANK YOU.
HAVE A NICE DAY.

01:19:13.983 --> 01:19:16.853

REGGIE HAMMOND.

01:19:16.853 --> 01:19:21.124
THIS IS $75,000,
COURTESY OF YOUR FATHER.

01:19:21.124 --> 01:19:23.860
FROM KIRKLAND SMITH?
IT'S GOT TO BE DIRTY.

01:19:23.860 --> 01:19:25.261
YOUR FATHER'S
NO ANGEL,

01:19:25.261 --> 01:19:27.263
BUT THIS MONEY
IS NOT STOLEN.

01:19:27.263 --> 01:19:29.866
YOUR FATHER DID
A FAVOR FOR ME.

01:19:29.866 --> 01:19:32.135
I OWED MONEY
TO YOUR FATHER.

01:19:32.135 --> 01:19:34.570
HE THOUGHT
IT WOULD BENEFIT YOU.

01:19:34.570 --> 01:19:37.206
I THINK
YOU SHOULD ACCEPT IT.

01:19:37.206 --> 01:19:38.875
BYE-BYE.

01:19:39.742 --> 01:19:41.377
MR. HAMMOND.

01:19:44.180 --> 01:19:45.581
HOW IS HE?

01:19:45.581 --> 01:19:48.417
HE'S GOOD.
YOU SHOULD GO SEE HIM.

01:19:49.685 --> 01:19:51.120
MAYBE.

01:19:51.120 --> 01:19:53.890
NO, NO MAYBE.
YOU SHOULD GO SEE HIM.

01:19:58.194 --> 01:19:59.295

01:20:28.324 --> 01:20:29.425
HEY.

01:20:29.425 --> 01:20:31.127
HI, BEN.

01:20:32.128 --> 01:20:35.131
SORRY I COULDN'T
HELP MORE, JACK.

01:20:35.131 --> 01:20:38.134
IT'S ALL RIGHT.
YOU DID WHAT YOU COULD.

01:20:38.134 --> 01:20:40.136
IT'LL BE PRETTY
FUCKING DULL

01:20:40.136 --> 01:20:42.138
WITHOUT YOU
AROUND HERE.

01:20:42.138 --> 01:20:45.408
I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU'RE NOT COMING
TO WORK TOMORROW.

01:20:48.677 --> 01:20:50.279
GET A BEER?

01:20:50.279 --> 01:20:51.280
MAYBE LATER.

01:21:04.760 --> 01:21:07.363
YOU GOT A BUNCH
OF MESSAGES, FRANK.

01:21:07.363 --> 01:21:08.965
THANKS, JOE.

01:21:20.776 --> 01:21:21.777
YEAH.

01:21:21.777 --> 01:21:23.379
WE GOT HAMMOND.

01:21:23.379 --> 01:21:24.380
GOOD.

01:21:24.380 --> 01:21:25.781
IS HE DEAD YET?

01:21:25.781 --> 01:21:29.752
THERE'S A CHANGE.
KILLING ONE OF US
WASN'T PART OF THE DEAL.

01:21:29.752 --> 01:21:31.955
WHAT KIND OF SHIT
ARE YOU PULLING?

01:21:31.955 --> 01:21:36.225
500 Gs. THAT'S
THE PRICE FOR YOU DOING
ONE OF THE BROTHERHOOD.

01:21:36.225 --> 01:21:38.827
WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

01:21:38.827 --> 01:21:41.230
500,000, OR WE LET
HAMMOND FINGER YOU.

01:21:41.230 --> 01:21:43.199
THERE'S A PLACE
OUT OF MODESTO--

01:21:43.199 --> 01:21:44.800
ARE YOU NUTS?
NO WAY.

01:21:44.800 --> 01:21:47.203
YOU WANT MORE MONEY,
PICK A NEW PLACE.

01:21:47.203 --> 01:21:49.638
SOMETHING INDOORS,
SOMETHING WITH
LOTS OF PEOPLE.

01:21:55.644 --> 01:21:57.213
JACK, THIS JUST CAME IN.

01:21:57.213 --> 01:22:01.217
SOME GUY NAMED BURROUGHS
LOOKS LIKE THE GUY
YOU WERE AFTER.

01:22:01.217 --> 01:22:04.853
THEY FOUND HIM DEAD
IN THE MISSION
A WHILE AGO.

01:22:04.853 --> 01:22:08.057
HERE'S HIS SHEET.
IT'S A MILE LONG.

01:22:10.994 --> 01:22:14.797
I CIRCULATED THIS GUY'S
PICTURE AT THE PRECINCT
LAST NIGHT.

01:22:14.797 --> 01:22:16.199
I GOT NOTHING.

01:22:16.199 --> 01:22:19.668
THAT'S FUNNY.
CRUISE BUSTED HIM LAST JULY.

01:22:44.960 --> 01:22:48.164
CATES, EVEN THOUGH THERE'S
NO LOVE LOST BETWEEN US,

01:22:48.164 --> 01:22:51.767
IT HURTS TO SEE A MAN
THROW AWAY HIS CAREER.

01:22:51.767 --> 01:22:53.402
LET'S LET
BYGONES BE BY--

01:23:32.875 --> 01:23:35.878
HEY, I'M LOOKING
FOR THE CAGE CLUB.

01:23:35.878 --> 01:23:37.480
THE UPSTAIRS PART.

01:23:37.480 --> 01:23:38.281
FIFTH FLOOR.

01:23:38.281 --> 01:23:41.084
YOU GOT TO JOIN.
50 BUCKS.

01:24:08.977 --> 01:24:11.447
YOU DON'T LOOK
TOO HAPPY, REG.

01:24:14.383 --> 01:24:17.553
SORRY, BABE.
I'LL BUY YOU A DRINK LATER.

01:24:27.996 --> 01:24:29.698
WHERE'S HAMMOND?

01:24:31.600 --> 01:24:33.001
WHO'S THE GIRL?

01:24:33.001 --> 01:24:35.404
JUST SOMEBODY
HE WAS WITH.

01:24:38.607 --> 01:24:41.410
500 Gs, RIGHT?

01:24:41.410 --> 01:24:46.149
NOW, LET'S CHECK
THE MERCHANDISE.

01:24:52.755 --> 01:24:56.359
TAKE HIM OUT
BEHIND THE BUILDING
AND BLOW HIM AWAY.

01:24:56.359 --> 01:24:58.161
SHOOT THE GIRL, TOO.

01:24:58.161 --> 01:25:00.163
