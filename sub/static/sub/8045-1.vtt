00:48.423 --> 00:51.176
Oh, my God.

00:51.218 --> 00:55.097
- Yeah, whoo!
- Like father, like son.

00:55.138 --> 00:59.518
- I look pretty cool in those glasses.
- You got chipmunk cheeks.

00:59.560 --> 01:01.645
What?
What was that?

01:02.646 --> 01:04.772
Cheeks!

01:10.779 --> 01:13.615
What a chef.
What's he doin', throwin' stuff?

01:13.657 --> 01:15.951
Wish I had one of those burgers now.

01:15.993 --> 01:18.745
- So cool.
- Look at Dad. He's my dad.

01:22.374 --> 01:24.960
- Flip those babies!
- Not bad.

01:27.629 --> 01:29.506
Whoops!

01:29.548 --> 01:32.676
What are you
laughing at, Scottie?

01:32.718 --> 01:35.554
Just kidding, Dad.

01:49.193 --> 01:52.362
All right, Mom!
Way to go!

01:52.404 --> 01:54.990
- Hi, baby.
- Look at her.

01:56.867 --> 01:59.995
Yeah, well, you're always that way.

02:02.956 --> 02:05.209
Get him! Get him.

02:07.252 --> 02:09.253
Aww.

02:09.670 --> 02:13.342
We're too young
to have kids your age.

02:13.383 --> 02:15.469
We really are!

02:17.971 --> 02:20.057
All right, let's cook those.

02:20.098 --> 02:22.935
Those were pretty good,
by the way, Dad.

02:37.157 --> 02:39.243
Hi, Grandma.

03:35.757 --> 03:37.843
Mmm.

06:05.407 --> 06:08.952
Oh, goddamn it, Cosmo.

07:27.698 --> 07:30.784
- Where the hell are they?
- I told them to wait for us.

07:30.826 --> 07:34.746
Hodges and Osborne are blowing it.
Jenke will slaughter that girl.

07:34.788 --> 07:36.874
You ready?

07:38.167 --> 07:41.003
<i>Backup on Lawrence.</i>

07:43.589 --> 07:47.009
<i>Squad, get to sector six.</i>

07:50.512 --> 07:54.141
Oh, Jesus Christ.
Where the fuck is that guy?

07:54.183 --> 07:56.268
He really gives me the creeps.

07:56.310 --> 07:59.563
He could be anywhere,
just waiting on us.

07:59.605 --> 08:04.359
Look, I take the diner,
you take the plant.

08:07.154 --> 08:09.573
Casey. Here.

08:13.702 --> 08:17.039
Remember when he got the jump
on Marriott and Young?

08:17.080 --> 08:19.833
It was broad daylight.
They were good cops.

08:19.875 --> 08:22.002
They never knew what hit them.

08:22.044 --> 08:25.214
I'll put 15 rounds in the prick.

08:26.131 --> 08:28.675
He eats and shits same as us, right?

08:30.761 --> 08:33.388
Squad, what do you got up there?

08:33.429 --> 08:35.515
- Let's go.
- Yeah.

09:15.973 --> 09:18.058
Oh, shit.

10:37.095 --> 10:40.766
Casey, Hodges and Osborne are dead.
Watch yourself.

10:40.807 --> 10:43.310
Casey?
God. Casey?

10:49.191 --> 10:51.276
Oh, shit.

11:22.266 --> 11:24.476
Luke, Luke...

11:25.310 --> 11:28.564
- I did the best I could.
- I know, buddy. I know.

11:28.605 --> 11:30.941
I-I-I was soared!

11:30.983 --> 11:33.944
- Jesus.
- I did the best...

11:33.986 --> 11:36.071
GOd!

11:36.113 --> 11:39.867
- What? What?
- Get Jenke! Get Jenke!

11:39.908 --> 11:42.911
I'll nail his fuckin' ass.
I'll get him.

11:42.953 --> 11:45.164
- That little girl...
- What?

11:45.205 --> 11:47.374
- She's...
- What?

11:48.709 --> 11:50.794
Oh, shit. Oh, Casey.

12:19.865 --> 12:23.452
Been looking forward
to this meeting for three years, cop.

12:23.493 --> 12:26.788
- Now, put the gun down.
- You're shittin' me, man.

12:26.830 --> 12:29.833
Put the gun down, or I
gut the little bitch!

12:31.752 --> 12:37.674
Hey, this is between you and me.
Let the girl go.

12:37.716 --> 12:40.969
OK.
First you put the gun down.

12:44.097 --> 12:45.474
Do it!

13:00.072 --> 13:02.574
Good little cop.

13:02.616 --> 13:07.079
Right here is where we show
each other what we got.

13:15.629 --> 13:17.798
Hey!

13:27.641 --> 13:30.310
Oh.

13:30.352 --> 13:32.521
You were having a nightmare.

13:32.563 --> 13:34.147
Oh.

13:35.232 --> 13:38.861
Oh, my God. I thought you were...

13:38.902 --> 13:40.404
Dead?

13:44.533 --> 13:46.577
Luke. Luke, Luke!

13:49.163 --> 13:51.915
- You're dreaming!
- Oh.

14:50.849 --> 14:54.102
I don't understand why
you want to see Jenke die.

14:54.144 --> 14:59.233
I want to see it. Then I know it's over.
Then I get back on the street.

14:59.274 --> 15:01.360
Have you talked to Hank Miller?

15:01.401 --> 15:04.112
Miller thinks that
I need more desk time,

15:04.154 --> 15:07.533
that I ought to continue
my sessions with Dr Tower.

15:07.574 --> 15:09.701
Maybe you should.

15:11.370 --> 15:13.747
Don't start with that psychiatry shit.

15:14.873 --> 15:17.000
Lucas, you tried to strangle me.

15:17.042 --> 15:20.671
Locking Jenke up
didn't make the nightmares stop.

15:20.712 --> 15:23.715
Maybe knowing that he's
dead won't either.

15:25.133 --> 15:27.761
Maybe you should see Dr Tower.

15:30.639 --> 15:34.226
I love you, Lucas, and I want you back.

15:36.979 --> 15:39.857
Come on, Jenke, it's checkout time.

15:41.900 --> 15:44.319
Keep that gun against his head.

16:43.045 --> 16:45.631
...here at Turner State Penitentiary,

16:45.672 --> 16:49.510
where Max Jenke,
the most feared mass murderer

16:49.551 --> 16:52.888
in this nation's history,
will be put to death.

16:52.930 --> 16:55.349
Max Jenke, whose last request

16:55.390 --> 17:00.145
was to be buried with the meat cleaver
he used to kill most of his victims,

17:00.187 --> 17:04.775
the number of which sources
conservatively estimate at more than 110,

17:04.816 --> 17:06.902
including seven police officers.

17:06.944 --> 17:09.488
Hold it, Joe. Detective McCarthy,

17:09.530 --> 17:13.992
you were involved in the Jenke
investigation from the beginning.

17:14.034 --> 17:17.329
It must be a relief
to see him off the streets.

17:17.371 --> 17:18.664
Yes.

17:18.704 --> 17:21.583
Are you happy that
Jenke will be executed?

17:21.625 --> 17:23.710
I'm happy to see justice sewed.

17:23.752 --> 17:27.256
You've been on leave
since Jenke's apprehension.

17:27.297 --> 17:30.509
- Will you be back soon?
- Ah, yes. Excuse me.

17:30.551 --> 17:34.847
Detective McCarthy how do you feel?

17:34.888 --> 17:36.974
Are you glad he'll die?

17:37.015 --> 17:41.019
Lucas McCarthy,
the man who captured Max Jenke.

18:53.550 --> 18:55.636
Glad you could make it, cop.

19:26.083 --> 19:28.961
Please, my son,
you need to make your peace.

19:33.549 --> 19:36.218
May God have mercy on your soul.

19:40.389 --> 19:43.267
Any last words, Jenke?

19:43.308 --> 19:45.727
Blow it out your ass, pinhead.

19:46.979 --> 19:49.857
All right, let's get on with this.

20:16.175 --> 20:20.262
Your worst fuckin' nightmare, Lucas.
I'm it.

20:52.169 --> 20:55.005
All that did was give me a hard-on.

20:59.343 --> 21:03.805
- Increase the voltage.
- Yeah, increase the voltage, shithead!

21:29.540 --> 21:31.458
We got to get out of here!

21:34.169 --> 21:40.676
Lucas, I'm going
to tear your world apart

21:40.717 --> 21:45.514
I'm coming back to fuck you up.

22:11.790 --> 22:14.042
- He's dead.
- Oh.

22:42.112 --> 22:45.949
- You're sure nobody's been in here?
- Professor, I told you,

22:45.991 --> 22:49.286
nobody's been in here
since I brought Jenke in.

22:49.328 --> 22:54.041
And you haven't heard or seen
anything unusual in here?

22:54.082 --> 22:57.002
What are you talking about?

22:57.044 --> 23:00.297
Power surges or electrical impulses.

23:00.339 --> 23:04.468
Listen, professor, the only
thing in here are dead bodies.

23:04.510 --> 23:10.224
The only power surges or electrical impulses
are the ones used to kill the fuck.

23:10.265 --> 23:13.727
Well, it may not be that easy, doctor.

23:14.895 --> 23:18.774
I've read some of your theories.
I think you're full of shit.

23:18.815 --> 23:23.987
I don't know how you got the state
to let you do this "research",

23:24.029 --> 23:27.741
but we sent 50,000 volts of juice
through that scum,

23:28.826 --> 23:31.161
and he's one dead son of a bitch.

23:32.704 --> 23:35.833
Well, I certainly hope so.

23:35.874 --> 23:39.336
- Could I have a look now, please?
- He's all yours.

23:45.092 --> 23:47.177
He looks pretty dead to me.

23:47.219 --> 23:49.096
Mm.

23:51.306 --> 23:53.559
What are you doing?

23:53.600 --> 23:56.353
Just satisfying my curiosity.

24:00.440 --> 24:05.571
Look, I've got work to do. I don't have
time to watch you... take readings.

24:05.612 --> 24:07.698
Call me when you're through.

25:37.579 --> 25:39.623
- Scott McCarthy?
- Yeah.

25:39.665 --> 25:41.750
Sign here.

25:42.668 --> 25:46.880
"Leave a message at the beep"?
Vinnie, where are you? I need...

25:46.922 --> 25:51.593
OK, great, Mary Ann.
I'll give you a call. OK. Bye-bye.

25:51.635 --> 25:54.346
- Who was that?
- Mary Ann.

25:54.388 --> 25:57.182
Mary Ann look a little like Don Johnson?

25:57.224 --> 26:00.602
- Mom!
- Who was that at the door, honey?

26:01.770 --> 26:04.273
It's OK. It was for me.

26:05.357 --> 26:08.777
I don't want anyone over here tonight
when we're out.

26:08.819 --> 26:12.406
- I'm 18 on Saturday.
- Well, you're still my baby.

26:13.574 --> 26:15.367
You seen Cosmo?

26:15.409 --> 26:18.453
He's probably chasing Scott
in the basement.

26:20.914 --> 26:23.000
Cosmo?

26:23.041 --> 26:26.378
Kitty, kitty. Come on. Kitty?

26:33.886 --> 26:37.431
Cosmo. Yummies.

26:37.472 --> 26:39.558
Yummies, kitty.

26:40.559 --> 26:42.644
Yummies. Come on.

26:45.731 --> 26:47.816
Cosmo.

26:54.823 --> 26:56.909
Come on.

26:57.743 --> 27:00.037
Cosmo?

27:01.205 --> 27:03.290
Cosmo.

27:11.757 --> 27:14.301
Cosmo?

27:14.343 --> 27:17.888
Come on, you little rat.
Come on, kitty.

27:19.473 --> 27:21.558
Kitty, kitty.

27:23.352 --> 27:26.688
Cosmo? Cosmo?

27:26.730 --> 27:29.441
Come on, you little rat.
Come on. Kitty?

27:30.192 --> 27:32.277
Kitty?

27:34.821 --> 27:36.907
Useless chunk of metal.

27:43.372 --> 27:47.543
Cosmo? I know you're in here.

27:47.584 --> 27:49.837
Kitty!

27:56.385 --> 27:58.095
Kitty?

28:05.310 --> 28:08.188
How'd it feel today,
watching him die?

28:10.232 --> 28:14.570
Well, the fucker didn't go down easy,
I'll say that for him.

28:14.611 --> 28:19.825
He had half the juice in the state
going through him, and he kept coming.

28:19.867 --> 28:21.952
It was unbelievable.

28:21.994 --> 28:24.371
You have any guilts about this?

28:24.413 --> 28:26.915
I would've paid to see that scum die.

28:28.292 --> 28:31.962
- You feel better, then?
- Yeah.

28:35.007 --> 28:38.218
I can get back to work
if you sign those release papers.

28:38.260 --> 28:40.846
What's that? On your shin.

28:41.763 --> 28:43.891
It's nothing. Just a scratch.

28:43.932 --> 28:47.644
- Did you cut yourself?
- I don't know.

28:47.686 --> 28:49.771
Let me see that. Open your shin.

28:49.813 --> 28:53.609
- What the hell for?
- I want to see it.

28:53.650 --> 28:57.613
- Just a second.
- What is that? How'd that happen?

28:57.654 --> 28:59.781
I don't know.
It's just a thing.

29:01.158 --> 29:03.327
You having that dream again?

29:05.287 --> 29:06.955
Yeah.

29:06.997 --> 29:09.166
Did he throw the cleaver?

29:09.958 --> 29:12.044
Yeah.

29:12.085 --> 29:14.379
You're Catholic, aren't you?

29:15.297 --> 29:17.382
No.

29:17.424 --> 29:21.762
Hm. I thought for a minute
it might be a stigmata.

29:21.803 --> 29:26.058
- Stigmata?
- Christ's wounds on the cross.

29:26.975 --> 29:31.313
Saints are reported to have bled
from them. Other people, too.

29:31.355 --> 29:34.525
I had an Irish cop last year
who shot a young boy.

29:34.566 --> 29:39.488
He started bleeding from the palms
of his hands. Very strange phenomenon.

29:40.531 --> 29:45.202
For Christ's sake. That's the
stupidest fucking thing I ever heard.

29:51.667 --> 29:55.671
Are you going to sign
this thing for me, Doc, or what?

29:56.713 --> 29:59.258
Yeah, I guess
I might as well get you started.

29:59.299 --> 30:01.009
Thank you, Doc.

30:01.051 --> 30:05.180
Put some soda water on that,
so that stain doesn't set.

30:05.222 --> 30:07.307
Yeah.

30:07.850 --> 30:09.935
Scott?

30:13.355 --> 30:16.191
- What's all this?
- It's Nestlé's Quik.

30:16.233 --> 30:18.902
Two cases of chocolate,
one of strawberry.

30:18.944 --> 30:23.157
- How will you pay for this?
- It's free. They sent it to me.

30:24.616 --> 30:26.702
Why?

30:27.452 --> 30:33.125
Because I told them I found rat hair in a
carton of their otherwise delicious product.

30:33.167 --> 30:36.795
Scott, it's the fourth
delivery this month.

30:40.674 --> 30:43.468
I have to talk to your
father about this.

30:44.136 --> 30:46.221
He's not going to be real happy.

30:46.263 --> 30:48.849
Mom, it's not that serious.

30:49.391 --> 30:51.518
I mean, what's the problem here?

30:51.560 --> 30:54.730
I just wish you wouldn't
rip off the entire world.

31:01.445 --> 31:03.655
Hey. Excuse me, you're on my car.

31:03.697 --> 31:06.950
Mr McCarthy, I need to talk to you.
He's coming back.

31:06.992 --> 31:10.829
- You were at the execution.
- It's Jenke. He's coming back.

31:10.871 --> 31:14.541
- What the fuck are you talking about?
- It's not over yet...

31:14.583 --> 31:17.961
I don't need this.
The guy is dead. He was fried.

31:18.003 --> 31:21.423
That's the point, you see,
he's coming back for you.

31:21.465 --> 31:24.635
- You're his link. His hatred...
- Are you a fucking nut?

31:24.676 --> 31:29.097
No, listen to me. It's very important.
He knows what frightens you.

31:29.139 --> 31:33.101
He'll eat at you any way he can.
He'll go through your family.

31:33.143 --> 31:35.395
- Not my family.
- It's very important.

31:35.437 --> 31:37.773
- Hey!
- Please, Mr McCarthy...

31:37.814 --> 31:41.193
Please, you gotta listen!

31:50.244 --> 31:53.330
- Mom?
- You scared me, honey.

31:53.372 --> 31:56.375
Sorry. So where's Daddy taking you?

31:56.416 --> 32:00.629
I don't know. I told him it had
to be someplace cops don't eat.

32:01.880 --> 32:05.300
- Have you seen my pink dress?
- Why?

32:05.342 --> 32:07.678
I want to see if it still fits.

32:07.719 --> 32:10.639
You're not dressing up for company?

32:10.681 --> 32:15.602
Mom, I just want to see if the dress fits.
For my party.

32:19.439 --> 32:22.276
It's probably in the basement.

32:22.317 --> 32:25.237
And I still don't want
Vinnie coming over.

32:25.279 --> 32:27.823
Thanks, Mom.

33:24.922 --> 33:27.257
Dammit, Vinnie, you scared me!

33:27.299 --> 33:29.635
Oh, sorry.

33:29.676 --> 33:32.804
- You weren't due till eight.
- I couldn't wait.

33:32.846 --> 33:34.932
I was overcome by desire.

33:36.475 --> 33:40.604
I gotta get back upstairs.
I'll come down when they're gone.

33:40.646 --> 33:43.190
- Oh, no, no, no, no.
- I promise.

33:56.537 --> 33:58.664
- Besides, Vinnie?
- Mm-hm?

33:58.705 --> 34:00.374
- Honey?
- Yeah?

34:00.415 --> 34:02.835
It gets better the longer you wait.

34:04.461 --> 34:07.798
Well... bigger, anyway.

34:28.944 --> 34:32.072
<i>Lucas...</i>

34:32.114 --> 34:36.326
I'm going to tear your world apart

35:00.767 --> 35:02.853
Jenke!

35:23.415 --> 35:24.583
Lucas!

35:44.019 --> 35:47.272
This is just the beginning.

35:51.985 --> 35:54.279
I'm still here.

35:57.115 --> 35:59.910
I nailed your ass good, didn't I?

35:59.952 --> 36:02.371
That's right, Lucas.

36:02.412 --> 36:06.416
And now it's my turn to watch you die.

36:24.893 --> 36:28.730
THE THINGS I HAVE DONE TO OUR LOVE]

36:37.906 --> 36:41.451
♪ I walked over late,
then I didn't knock

36:41.493 --> 36:44.955
♪ I really should have knocked
but I turned the other way

36:44.997 --> 36:46.999
♪ You know how much I walk

36:47.040 --> 36:49.001
♪ I walk around a lot

36:49.042 --> 36:52.129
♪ I son it out and set it straight

36:52.171 --> 36:55.090
♪ But I can't pick the
right time to explain

36:55.132 --> 36:58.594
♪ All the things I have done to our love

36:58.635 --> 37:02.014
♪ All the things that happened because

37:02.055 --> 37:05.267
♪ Of the things I have
done to our love... ♪

37:06.393 --> 37:08.770
You left the front door unlocked.

37:08.812 --> 37:12.149
- I didn't leave it open.
- Somebody brought these in.

37:13.025 --> 37:15.110
Oh.

37:21.742 --> 37:24.828
The news said it took him
ten minutes to die.

37:24.870 --> 37:28.332
- Mm-hm.
- Was it awful?

37:31.710 --> 37:33.795
At least it's over now.

37:39.635 --> 37:42.846
Vinnie? Where are you going?

37:45.265 --> 37:47.351
Bonnie?

37:47.392 --> 37:48.977
Bonnie?

37:55.234 --> 37:57.319
Bonnie, where are you?

37:58.445 --> 38:01.782
I'm watching you.

38:01.824 --> 38:05.911
Come on, Bonnie, if you come out,
we could have a lot more fun.

38:05.953 --> 38:10.499
Yeah, but doesn't it
make you horny knowing I'm watching?

38:10.541 --> 38:12.626
Huh.

38:12.668 --> 38:14.837
That's kinky.

38:14.878 --> 38:18.924
- Mm-hm.
- That's real kinky.

38:24.721 --> 38:27.057
Take your pants down.

38:30.811 --> 38:33.063
Baby, you are out there.

38:34.481 --> 38:38.402
I love you, Vinnie. Do it for me.

38:38.443 --> 38:42.156
- Please?
- OK.

38:44.324 --> 38:47.870
I think I'm going to leave
some of this for you.

38:47.911 --> 38:51.081
OK. Then unbutton your shin.

38:51.123 --> 38:53.208
Unbutton my shirt?

38:57.504 --> 38:59.923
Is this what you want?

38:59.965 --> 39:01.758
Mm-hm.

39:03.552 --> 39:05.429
Nice.

39:05.470 --> 39:09.892
That's right. I love you, Vinnie.
Do it for me.

39:09.933 --> 39:13.312
- I love you...
- Vinnie. Do it for me.

39:13.353 --> 39:15.022
Oh, God!

39:25.949 --> 39:28.035
No!

39:36.835 --> 39:39.338
And besides the Nestle's Quik,

39:39.379 --> 39:45.093
the little con man has so much stuff under
his bed, I check before I go to the market.

39:45.135 --> 39:48.347
Who's he get that from? You or me?

39:48.388 --> 39:51.058
Don't answer that.

39:56.104 --> 39:58.190
What is this stuff?

40:03.070 --> 40:05.989
Two weeks off in Barbados,

40:06.031 --> 40:10.494
- then back to active duty.
- That's great.

40:10.536 --> 40:13.747
We can take those kids
that live in our house,

40:13.789 --> 40:17.084
if you don't think
they'll cramp our style.

40:20.003 --> 40:22.673
- Can I come and sit next to you?
- Yeah.

40:30.556 --> 40:32.641
You know I love you?

40:32.683 --> 40:34.768
Mm-hm.

40:41.024 --> 40:43.152
Vinnie?

40:46.071 --> 40:48.157
Vinnie?

40:52.452 --> 40:54.538
Vinnie?

40:58.917 --> 41:01.003
Vinnie.

41:05.549 --> 41:07.634
Vinnie?

41:22.691 --> 41:26.904
Vinnie? I know you're here.

41:26.945 --> 41:29.406
Come out, come out.

41:32.034 --> 41:34.119
Vinnie?

42:14.409 --> 42:16.495
Uh-huh.

42:31.635 --> 42:33.720
Now I've gotcha!

42:46.066 --> 42:49.444
Scott? Bonnie?
We're home.

43:18.015 --> 43:20.100
Good article?

43:20.142 --> 43:23.937
Engrossing? Can't put it down?

43:23.979 --> 43:26.690
Mm. I don't know.

43:26.732 --> 43:30.986
If I was Elvis Presley,
I don't think I'd fake my own death

43:31.028 --> 43:35.491
and move to Kalamazoo
just to eat at a Burger King, do you?

43:35.532 --> 43:37.993
- I believe it.
- You would.

43:38.035 --> 43:40.120
Mm.

43:44.166 --> 43:45.667
Yeah?

43:45.709 --> 43:48.879
<i>Did I catch you
with your pants down?</i>

43:48.921 --> 43:52.257
<i>You can't hide from me, cop.</i>

43:58.055 --> 44:00.140
Who was that?

44:00.182 --> 44:02.267
Wrong number.

44:27.042 --> 44:29.127
- Jesus!
- Shh!

44:29.169 --> 44:33.549
Never sneak up on a man
when he's blasting Metallica.

44:33.590 --> 44:35.884
Sorry. Help me look for Vinnie.

44:35.926 --> 44:39.429
Why? I thought you had
a rendezvous in the basement.

44:39.471 --> 44:43.141
He's not there.
I think he's in the house someplace.

44:43.183 --> 44:47.104
Great! If Dad...
If Dad finds him, he'll kick his ass.

44:47.145 --> 44:49.231
I know.

44:50.858 --> 44:52.943
Please?

44:59.992 --> 45:02.077
- Shh.
- OK.

45:13.630 --> 45:15.716
Come on.

45:17.009 --> 45:19.094
Shush.

45:59.676 --> 46:01.887
He might've just left, you know.

46:01.929 --> 46:05.516
No. He likes me too much,
And besides, he was too horny.

46:05.557 --> 46:07.726
I don't want to hear about this.

46:28.413 --> 46:30.499
Vinnie?

46:43.095 --> 46:46.932
- Vinnie, this isn't funny.
- Jesus, Bonnie!

46:48.141 --> 46:50.227
It's Dad!

47:02.990 --> 47:05.742
- Why's he going downstairs?
- Vinnie.

47:17.296 --> 47:19.548
'Hey, Lucas...

47:19.590 --> 47:21.925
<i>I've seen your daughter.</i>

47:21.967 --> 47:24.136
<i>She's pretty.</i>

47:24.178 --> 47:27.306
<i>Real pretty.</i>

47:27.347 --> 47:30.017
You stay the fuck away from my family.

47:30.058 --> 47:33.103
In fact, she looks good enough to eat.

47:33.145 --> 47:35.647
You stay away from my daughter,
you shit!

47:37.483 --> 47:40.736
- Dad found Vinnie.
- Hope he doesn't hurt him.

47:40.777 --> 47:43.697
Stay the fuck away!

47:54.082 --> 47:57.544
- What are you kids doing up?
- What's going on here?

47:58.754 --> 48:02.341
I thought I heard
something in the basement.

48:04.092 --> 48:06.011
Bonnie?

48:06.053 --> 48:08.180
Oh, I...

48:12.809 --> 48:15.562
Vinnie came over while
you guys were out.

48:17.523 --> 48:20.442
And I guess Dad
found him in the basement.

48:22.694 --> 48:26.406
- Is he down there?
- No, there's nobody in the basement.

48:27.491 --> 48:29.827
I heard you talking to somebody.

48:29.868 --> 48:33.372
Hey!
I didn't talk to anybody, all right?

48:35.999 --> 48:40.087
You kids go to bed now.
I told you I didn't want Vinnie here.

48:40.128 --> 48:44.466
You're grounded. No arguments.
Now go to bed, both of you.

48:49.471 --> 48:51.557
Luke?

49:07.656 --> 49:09.700
Mm, smells great, Mom.

49:09.741 --> 49:13.287
Wow, that's some turkey, Mom.
Is it Thanksgiving?

49:13.328 --> 49:18.500
I thought I'd cook your father's favourite,
and we could all have lunch together.

49:18.542 --> 49:21.545
- Where is Dad?
- He's fixing the furnace.

49:24.840 --> 49:26.925
I fixed it.

49:26.967 --> 49:31.847
That was some power surge.
It shorted out the furnace, but I fixed it.

49:31.889 --> 49:34.808
I think that thing's
got a mind of its own.

49:34.850 --> 49:38.478
- Yeah, killer furnace.
- Give me one of those.

49:38.520 --> 49:42.149
Why don't you get cleaned up?
Lunch is almost ready.

49:42.191 --> 49:46.320
All right. Give the music a rest, Scott.

49:46.361 --> 49:49.323
What? I can't hear you.
The music's too loud.

49:49.364 --> 49:51.783
Save it till after lunch.

50:00.250 --> 50:02.336
Lose it, Scott!

50:03.670 --> 50:05.756
How does he do that?

50:09.468 --> 50:11.970
You know that I love you all.

50:15.015 --> 50:17.100
Dig in.

50:17.142 --> 50:19.937
Mary Ellen
didn't have a power surge.

50:19.978 --> 50:22.648
Mary Ellen doesn't have
40-year-old wiring.

50:22.689 --> 50:25.984
Or two shod people
incapable of turning off lights.

50:26.026 --> 50:27.277
Thank God!

50:27.319 --> 50:31.198
- Imagine what her kids would look like?
- She's a nice lady.

50:31.240 --> 50:34.618
Bonnie, are you going
to that concert with Vinnie?

50:34.660 --> 50:37.663
I called him, but he
didn't return my calls.

50:37.704 --> 50:41.416
- He's probably working with his dad.
- In the mortuary.

50:42.501 --> 50:44.670
No, his parents are gone this weekend.

50:44.711 --> 50:47.923
- I'm sure he'll call.
- I don't think so.

50:47.965 --> 50:51.760
If I know Vinnie, he's probably
going out with Bobbie Sue,

50:51.802 --> 50:56.431
- or Mimi with the "Look at my big boobies..."
- Scott!

50:56.473 --> 50:59.601
- He'll call. Don't worry, baby.
- Thanks, Dad.

50:59.643 --> 51:05.023
- Your grandpa always ate the drumstick.
- Wow, Mom, that's some cool trivia.

51:05.065 --> 51:07.151
You remember?

51:15.200 --> 51:18.912
Don't look now, cop,
but your family's dead.

51:25.002 --> 51:29.131
“this big! And he did.
They were really huge, remember?

51:29.173 --> 51:32.301
Just kidding.

51:39.850 --> 51:41.727
Lucas.

51:43.937 --> 51:46.023
Hey...

51:46.940 --> 51:49.943
I just don't like turkey, all right?

51:49.985 --> 51:54.698
Oh, like George Bush's wife
doesn't look like his mom, right?

51:54.740 --> 51:59.953
Come on. Dan Quayle's wife
doesn't look like Trigger?

51:59.995 --> 52:02.164
Come on. Come on!

52:05.667 --> 52:08.795
I was there for one
night, a one-night show.

52:08.837 --> 52:13.592
This guy that picks me up at the airport,
one of these guys, you know,

52:13.634 --> 52:16.345
"Halt! Who goes there?"

52:17.221 --> 52:21.767
"Bobby Powell. I'm a comic.
I came to make people feel good."

52:21.808 --> 52:26.814
Funny thing happened today -
I saw a lady and a baby hit by a truck.

52:26.855 --> 52:31.777
So, I go into this bar,
and the bartender says...

52:31.819 --> 52:36.240
“'Make me laugh.“ “Can I just get
to the airport? I'm a Virgo.

52:36.281 --> 52:39.743
"Get to the airport
before I get to the airport?"

52:39.785 --> 52:43.413
<i>I say, “Martini for me,
Bloody Mary for my cleaver.“</i>

52:43.455 --> 52:46.542
Bartender says,
“Sorry, Mary's off today.“

52:47.960 --> 52:51.088
But not all women
were born to be barmaids.

52:51.129 --> 52:54.383
Take my wife...
and disembowel her, please.

52:55.467 --> 53:00.305
My wife said, "I want a vacation.
Take me someplace I've never been."

53:00.347 --> 53:02.850
I said, "The kitchen or the morgue?"

53:02.891 --> 53:06.979
My psychiatrist said,
"Jenke, you're a homicidal maniac."

53:07.020 --> 53:11.024
I wanted a second opinion.
He said, "You're ugly, too."

53:13.110 --> 53:15.362
My wife likes to talk after sex.

53:15.404 --> 53:18.657
Just last week,
she called me from Las Vegas.

53:22.870 --> 53:29.376
Lucas, you haven't played Bang The Beaver
with the little woman for a long time.

53:29.418 --> 53:32.838
She must be one horny little bitch.

53:36.008 --> 53:39.219
No!

53:49.771 --> 53:53.275
Goddamn it!
I gotta know what's happening! I'm...

53:54.318 --> 53:58.530
I'm seeing things.
I might be doing weird shit.

53:58.572 --> 54:02.659
My wife is going to leave me.
I don't want to hurt my kids.

54:07.498 --> 54:09.583
Am I crazy?

54:11.960 --> 54:13.837
Am I?

54:13.879 --> 54:16.965
You gotta tell me something
that makes sense.

54:18.467 --> 54:22.429
I haven't been much help, have I?

54:22.471 --> 54:28.560
I can't get Jenke out of my head.
If I could find him, I could deal with it.

56:24.051 --> 56:26.553
Oh, God.

56:42.736 --> 56:44.822
Fucking ass!

57:03.549 --> 57:06.218
Don't fuckin' move.

57:13.183 --> 57:15.269
You again?

57:19.064 --> 57:21.150
Professor of what?

57:21.191 --> 57:24.236
My name is Peter Campbell.
I'm a scientist.

57:24.278 --> 57:28.574
- You're shadowing me.
- No. I'm trying to help you.

57:28.615 --> 57:32.035
- You think you're going crazy.
- I do?

57:32.077 --> 57:35.038
Max Jenke is not dead.

57:35.080 --> 57:37.249
No?

57:37.291 --> 57:39.459
The electrocution, it...

57:39.501 --> 57:43.338
it allowed him to move
from the material plane.

57:47.426 --> 57:51.930
I know it sounds crazy, but...
I only want to help you.

57:51.972 --> 57:56.018
Help me?
You gotta be fuckin' kiddin' me.

58:03.150 --> 58:06.487
You still here? Take a hike!

58:07.571 --> 58:11.909
Look. I understand how you feel,
but we could help each other.

58:11.950 --> 58:16.330
I'm so close. Look at this place.

58:16.371 --> 58:20.417
Look where we are.
It's like being inside of Jenke's head.

58:20.459 --> 58:22.544
This place is pure evil.

58:25.714 --> 58:27.883
I know why I'm here.

58:27.925 --> 58:30.427
How come you're here?

58:30.469 --> 58:34.640
You know something?
You're really starting to piss me off.

58:36.266 --> 58:39.144
But how are you going to help me?

58:39.186 --> 58:42.523
When I was at Columbia,
I was working on a theory

58:42.564 --> 58:46.610
of evil as a form of electromagnetic
energy - an electricity of evil.

58:46.652 --> 58:52.407
That's why I got interested in Jenke.
He was the purest form of evil available.

58:52.449 --> 58:54.326
Cut the bullshit!

58:54.368 --> 58:56.787
Don't you get it? This is it.

58:56.829 --> 59:00.123
- What?
- This is an electric chair.

59:03.961 --> 59:09.091
He was practising, like taking snake
venom to build up his immunity.

59:10.300 --> 59:15.639
He can still interreact with us. He can do
more damage than if he were alive.

59:15.681 --> 59:21.270
In order to fight him, we've got
to bring him back here, use the same...

59:21.311 --> 59:23.105
Hey, relax.

59:23.147 --> 59:28.443
Electricity. We've gotta shoot him with
enough volts to bring him back here.

59:28.485 --> 59:32.197
The longer he stays wherever he is,
the stronger he gets.

59:32.239 --> 59:34.616
He can already manipulate our reality.

59:36.243 --> 59:38.328
Shoot him with juice,

59:38.370 --> 59:40.455
bring him back here,

59:40.497 --> 59:44.877
then it's simply a matter
of blowing the motherfucker away.

59:44.918 --> 59:47.004
Keep talking.

01:00:08.817 --> 01:00:11.236
- Hello.
- Hey, babe!

01:00:11.278 --> 01:00:13.530
Vinnie! Where have you been?

01:00:13.572 --> 01:00:15.657
All over the place.

01:00:15.699 --> 01:00:20.496
Sorry I had to leave, but I think I left
my wallet on the furnace in your basement.

01:00:20.537 --> 01:00:22.873
Could you check for me, please?

01:00:22.915 --> 01:00:26.502
Not unless you tell me
why you didn't call earlier.

01:00:26.543 --> 01:00:29.296
I left you a surprise in the basement.

01:00:30.839 --> 01:00:33.342
Vinnie? Vinnie?

01:02:03.223 --> 01:02:05.767
Oh, Jesus.

01:02:05.809 --> 01:02:08.228
Ahh! Vinnie.

01:02:09.271 --> 01:02:11.773
No! Vinnie!

01:02:31.376 --> 01:02:34.046
- Hold it. Open it up.
- Hey, stand back.

01:02:34.087 --> 01:02:36.215
Open it up.

01:02:39.968 --> 01:02:43.597
Oh, crap. Vinnie.

01:02:53.106 --> 01:02:55.192
What happened, Hank?

01:02:55.234 --> 01:02:58.821
Your daughter found
Vinnie's body in your basement.

01:02:58.862 --> 01:03:01.073
He'd been cut in half.

01:03:01.990 --> 01:03:05.077
- How's Bonnie?
- She's had a bad shock.

01:03:05.118 --> 01:03:09.665
- I wanna talk to her.
- Christ, you can't talk to her now.

01:03:09.706 --> 01:03:13.043
- Why not?
- Let's talk about it downtown.

01:03:13.085 --> 01:03:15.295
You're going to arrest me, Hank?

01:03:15.337 --> 01:03:19.466
Let's just say that I want
to ask you a few more questions.

01:03:20.843 --> 01:03:23.679
I didn't do this!

01:03:23.720 --> 01:03:25.806
I didn't do this!

01:03:29.226 --> 01:03:32.938
Hank, get them out of the house.
Will you do that for me?

01:03:32.980 --> 01:03:35.649
Please, Hank.

01:03:41.196 --> 01:03:43.782
3:30am, September 25th.

01:03:43.824 --> 01:03:49.288
I am preparing what I believe will be an
effective means of eliminating Max Jenke.

01:03:50.372 --> 01:03:55.460
For some time now, I have believed
that the same electromagnetic energy

01:03:55.502 --> 01:03:59.047
that released Jenke
can be used to bring him back

01:03:59.089 --> 01:04:02.718
from whatever godforsaken
place he came from.

01:04:02.759 --> 01:04:06.388
Using his focus,
Lucas McCarthy, as the bait,

01:04:06.430 --> 01:04:11.310
I believe that I can successfully
lure Jenke to his destruction.

01:04:13.353 --> 01:04:18.358
Tonight's experiments will...
will verify the validity of my theory.

01:04:29.536 --> 01:04:32.706
Interesting theory,
Professor Campbell...

01:04:33.499 --> 01:04:36.126
but there are definitely flaws.

01:04:42.466 --> 01:04:44.009
Oh, my God.

01:04:48.222 --> 01:04:52.601
What about this Campbell guy?
Can he give you an alibi?

01:04:52.643 --> 01:04:54.895
- No.
- Did he kill the kid?

01:04:54.937 --> 01:04:56.980
I told you, no.

01:04:57.022 --> 01:05:01.860
Well, what's the connection?
What does he have to do with the murder?

01:05:06.240 --> 01:05:08.325
Lucas!

01:05:10.494 --> 01:05:13.080
How long have I known you? 15 years?

01:05:14.039 --> 01:05:17.668
Here in my gut,
I know you're good people.

01:05:19.253 --> 01:05:23.799
But I also gotta tell you,
you're in this neck-deep and sinking.

01:05:24.716 --> 01:05:28.637
That's head-warming -
you guys going back a long time,

01:05:28.679 --> 01:05:30.806
but it doesn't mean shit!

01:05:30.848 --> 01:05:36.228
What I got ls pieces of Vinnie Capparelli
plastered all over your basement!

01:05:37.062 --> 01:05:41.150
And your own son and daughter
heard you and Capparelli...

01:05:41.191 --> 01:05:43.277
I was not talking to Vinnie.

01:05:44.069 --> 01:05:46.905
Bullshit! What, the ghost story again?

01:05:49.032 --> 01:05:52.995
- Are we through yet?
- No, we're not through.

01:05:53.954 --> 01:05:56.165
I can vouch for this man.

01:05:57.374 --> 01:05:59.459
This is a good cop.

01:05:59.501 --> 01:06:01.587
Well, I don't know him.

01:06:01.628 --> 01:06:05.299
You could be Charlie fucking Manson
except for his word,

01:06:05.340 --> 01:06:07.509
and I don't even know you!

01:06:08.886 --> 01:06:12.806
- How long you been on the force?
- 19 years.

01:06:12.848 --> 01:06:15.517
Been cited for bravery seven times.

01:06:15.559 --> 01:06:18.604
- Worked your way up from the street, huh?
- That's right.

01:06:18.645 --> 01:06:21.398
Oh, you're a tough guy, a real hero.

01:06:21.440 --> 01:06:23.525
What's the point?

01:06:23.567 --> 01:06:28.864
You knew Vinnie was slipping the stones
to your little girl, right?

01:06:28.906 --> 01:06:30.991
No, that's not right.

01:06:31.033 --> 01:06:34.244
What - he wasn't fuckin' her
or you didn't know?

01:06:34.286 --> 01:06:36.371
Get the fuck outta my face.

01:06:36.413 --> 01:06:40.584
No, I'm staying the fuck in your face
until you tell me the truth!

01:06:40.626 --> 01:06:45.380
Now, you came home and you found
this kid with his dick in his hand,

01:06:45.422 --> 01:06:48.342
- and you got pissed off!
- Fuck you.

01:06:49.343 --> 01:06:53.680
He talked back to you.
He came at you. He picked up something.

01:06:53.722 --> 01:06:55.808
What did he do - threaten you?

01:06:57.851 --> 01:06:59.937
Fuck me?

01:07:01.939 --> 01:07:05.651
Did he say fuck me? No! Fuck you!

01:07:08.529 --> 01:07:11.990
Lucas, maybe you thought
it was a burglar.

01:07:12.032 --> 01:07:15.452
A man has a right
to protect his home and family.

01:07:15.494 --> 01:07:19.039
You'd like that, wouldn't you?
Thanks, but no thanks.

01:07:19.081 --> 01:07:21.875
- We're just trying to help.
- You wanna help me?

01:07:21.917 --> 01:07:24.044
Get this sweaty prick off my back.

01:07:24.086 --> 01:07:28.257
Fine, but you lock
one thing up here, OK?

01:07:28.298 --> 01:07:31.760
I got one murder. I got one suspect.

01:07:31.802 --> 01:07:34.221
They teach you math at the academy?

01:07:36.807 --> 01:07:39.726
I'm just an internal
affairs officer, OK?

01:07:40.561 --> 01:07:44.148
You know what it means
to be in internal affairs?

01:07:44.189 --> 01:07:47.234
It means every time some cop goes bad,

01:07:47.276 --> 01:07:50.195
I get it up the ass
from the boys downtown,

01:07:50.237 --> 01:07:52.656
and I gotta go downtown now!

01:07:53.740 --> 01:07:55.826
- You're breaking my head.
- Fine.

01:07:55.868 --> 01:08:01.498
Look, I didn't ask for this fuckin' job,
but I got it and I got good at it.

01:08:02.374 --> 01:08:08.005
I taught myself to learn one thing, one
truth, and that is that we're all guilty.

01:08:08.046 --> 01:08:11.592
The only thing that counts
is whether you get caught.

01:08:11.633 --> 01:08:13.719
Now process this, asshole!

01:08:26.482 --> 01:08:29.067
You got all the Campbell stuff, Hank?

01:08:29.109 --> 01:08:33.613
- Yeah.
- It's in your court I'm counting on you.

01:08:33.654 --> 01:08:36.073
We'll knock this thing.

01:08:38.035 --> 01:08:40.120
Excuse me.

01:08:43.247 --> 01:08:48.295
My God, what a nightmare.
To be a cop arrested by your own kind.

01:08:48.337 --> 01:08:50.421
Who are you?

01:08:50.464 --> 01:08:55.385
Oh, excuse me. I'm Michael Jameson.
I'm your court-appointed attorney.

01:08:56.470 --> 01:08:58.846
My card.

01:09:01.642 --> 01:09:05.770
I can only imagine what would happen
if you were sent to prison.

01:09:05.813 --> 01:09:08.689
Get me to a judge. I want to make bail.

01:09:08.732 --> 01:09:13.694
Well, under the circumstances, I'm
afraid that's going to be impossible.

01:09:13.737 --> 01:09:17.866
You don't understand, I want to get
out of here. I want to go home now.

01:09:18.742 --> 01:09:21.370
I told you I'd be back.

01:09:33.215 --> 01:09:37.051
Hello.

You want me? Come and get me!

01:21:54.998 --> 01:21:57.084
Come on!

01:22:00.003 --> 01:22:03.590
Lucas, electricity from the plant...

01:22:03.632 --> 01:22:07.469
Use it. Bring him back...

01:22:07.511 --> 01:22:10.222
And blow the asshole away.

01:22:19.773 --> 01:22:21.859
Lucas!

01:22:28.866 --> 01:22:30.951

01:23:01.106 --> 01:23:04.193
Lucas!

01:23:36.767 --> 01:23:39.019
Too late again, mister.

01:23:39.061 --> 01:23:42.356
Hey! No, no, no!

01:23:54.159 --> 01:23:57.704
Oh, Jesus!

01:24:04.795 --> 01:24:06.255
Oh, man.

01:24:12.427 --> 01:24:14.096
Lucas, look out!

01:24:26.608 --> 01:24:28.694
Goddamn it!

01:24:39.037 --> 01:24:41.331
Your bitch is still alive.

01:24:42.666 --> 01:24:45.586
I thought you might
want to watch me work.

01:24:46.705 --> 01:24:49.333
That's far enough, asshole.

01:24:50.376 --> 01:24:54.797
- Let her go.
- Why would I want to do that?

01:24:56.048 --> 01:24:58.717
Take me, Jenke. Let her go.

01:24:58.759 --> 01:25:02.638
I've already got you and your family,
you stupid fuck.

01:25:03.597 --> 01:25:09.103
So, family man, how do you like it
on the other side?

01:25:11.271 --> 01:25:14.900
- Let her go, Jenke.
- Get on your knees!

01:25:20.781 --> 01:25:25.035
Why don't you crawl over here
and lick my boots?

01:25:27.037 --> 01:25:29.289
Don't do it, Lucas.

01:25:29.331 --> 01:25:32.626
- It's OK, baby.
- Lick the fucking floor!

01:25:55.149 --> 01:25:58.360
Lucas!

01:26:04.950 --> 01:26:07.077
Not even close, bitch!

01:26:34.855 --> 01:26:37.191
I want my children.

01:26:37.232 --> 01:26:39.026
Fuck the children!

01:26:45.949 --> 01:26:49.912
Lucas! This isn't finished!

01:27:10.307 --> 01:27:11.517
Come on.

01:27:21.402 --> 01:27:25.322
- What are you doing?
- Come on. Come here.

01:27:28.409 --> 01:27:32.746
We've got to get the power on.
It's the only way to stop him.

01:27:34.373 --> 01:27:37.167
- I don't understand.
- Trust me.

01:27:42.339 --> 01:27:44.425
Don't touch him!

01:27:54.268 --> 01:27:56.478
The wire! Use the wire!

01:27:59.356 --> 01:28:01.483
Back the fuck off, bitch!

01:28:17.750 --> 01:28:20.794
Get down!

01:28:22.004 --> 01:28:23.339
Fuck you!

01:29:33.826 --> 01:29:36.328
I hope that's it. We're full up.

01:29:36.370 --> 01:29:39.331
- That's everything.
- Check the basement.

01:29:39.373 --> 01:29:42.876
- Ah, Dad!
- You might have left something behind.

01:29:53.137 --> 01:29:55.222
- Mr McCarthy?
- Yeah.

01:29:55.264 --> 01:29:57.975
- Scott McCarthy?
- That's me.

01:29:58.017 --> 01:30:01.937
I've got something
to talk to you about, young man.

01:30:02.980 --> 01:30:05.607
All right!

01:30:07.317 --> 01:30:12.156
I've been with Uncle Tex for 15 years,
and we never had this happen.

01:30:12.197 --> 01:30:15.367
Uncle Tex gives you
his personal apology.

01:30:15.409 --> 01:30:19.747
He personally inspected the hands
of every Tex's employee.

01:30:19.788 --> 01:30:22.833
Well, they've all got two good ones.

01:30:22.875 --> 01:30:25.961
Uncle Tex gives you
his personal assurance

01:30:26.003 --> 01:30:29.882
that the object you found in our chilli
was not a human thumb,

01:30:29.923 --> 01:30:34.345
and he hopes you will accept this five-year
supply of chilli - complimentary.

01:30:34.386 --> 01:30:38.140
And if you're ever
in Texas, look us up, you hear?

01:30:38.182 --> 01:30:40.768
- You got it.
- Dad!

01:30:41.852 --> 01:30:45.314
- Mom! Dad!
- What?

01:30:46.148 --> 01:30:48.317
What, baby?

01:30:48.359 --> 01:30:52.237
You'll never believe this!
Look who I found!

Oh, baby! Let me get a picture.
