- So let's talk about your
feelings about pain medication.

10:28.600 --> 10:31.400
- Yeah.

10:31.400 --> 10:33.000
- I don't know.

10:33.000 --> 10:35.133
- How numb do you get
when do the epidural?

10:35.133 --> 10:38.500
- If they give the full dose,
you really can't feel anything.

10:38.500 --> 10:40.133
- I would get an Elvis dose.

10:40.133 --> 10:43.133
Okay.

10:44.667 --> 10:46.667
Getting your body ready
for this experience,

10:46.667 --> 10:48.100
there's a couple of different

10:48.100 --> 10:50.467
conditioning exercises
that we can try.

10:50.467 --> 10:53.400
First of all, when
in the pushing stage of labor,

10:53.400 --> 10:56.533
squatting actually
opens up the pelvis.

10:56.533 --> 10:59.133
And so one of the things
we want to be able to do

10:59.133 --> 11:03.734
is squat comfortably
for about 60 seconds.

11:03.734 --> 11:06.166
Let's just try it together.
So maybe you can hold hands.

11:06.166 --> 11:08.567
You can be her partner on this.
Face each other.

11:08.567 --> 11:11.033
- Yes, I washed them.

11:11.033 --> 11:13.233
- Both of you are gonna go down
very slowly

11:13.233 --> 11:15.567
as far as you can comfortably.

11:15.567 --> 11:18.100
- This could be sad if I can
go further than you can.

11:18.100 --> 11:19.633
- Very good.

11:19.633 --> 11:21.433
And then go ahead
and slowly back up.

11:21.433 --> 11:22.567
All right.

11:22.567 --> 11:24.767
- Whenever I find myself

11:24.767 --> 11:26.667
starting to get overwhelmed
with all of

11:26.667 --> 11:28.166
the choices you have to make...

11:28.166 --> 11:30.233
- Let's try doing pelvic rocks.

11:30.233 --> 11:31.700
You're gonna tilt
your hips forward

11:31.700 --> 11:33.667
and let your belly
sag toward the floor.

11:33.667 --> 11:35.000
Start with a flat back--

11:35.000 --> 11:36.233
- Don't look at my boobs,
Whitney.

11:36.233 --> 11:38.033
- I'm not looking
at your boobs.

11:38.033 --> 11:39.633
- Start with a flat back.

11:39.633 --> 11:41.667
- I tell myself that

11:41.667 --> 11:45.300
cavewomen did this
literally with nothing.

11:45.300 --> 11:48.066
- Your hips are gonna tilt
this way and back.

11:48.066 --> 11:49.600
There you go, perfect.
- There you go.

11:49.600 --> 11:52.200
- And then back to flat.
Right.

11:52.200 --> 11:56.467
- And if they can do it,
I can do it.

11:56.467 --> 11:58.166
- You're gonna move over
a little bit

11:58.166 --> 11:59.467
right behind her here.

11:59.467 --> 12:01.066
- Oh, God!
- Just--just right here.

12:01.066 --> 12:03.066
Now put your hands on each side.
- Oh, yeah.

12:03.066 --> 12:05.200
- No! Make it stop.

12:05.200 --> 12:07.467
- And press in...
- Stop!

12:07.467 --> 12:09.600
- Slightly here on the sides.
- Whitney...

12:09.600 --> 12:11.200
- No--

12:11.200 --> 12:12.600
Don't go crazy.

12:12.600 --> 12:14.200
- Oh, God.

12:14.200 --> 12:15.700
- It feels like...
- You can feel your pelvis--

12:15.700 --> 12:19.533
- A pervert is touching me.

12:21.200 --> 12:23.567
- No. No, that's enough.
- Okay. I got the picture.

12:23.567 --> 12:25.734
- All right, so we got
a couple of techniques.

12:25.734 --> 12:27.500
- Yes.
I feel a lot better.

12:27.500 --> 12:29.500
- Oh, good, good.
- Thank you so much.

12:29.500 --> 12:31.500
- You're so welcome.
- I really appreciate it.

12:31.500 --> 12:33.166
- Okay. Thank you very much.

12:33.166 --> 12:34.233
- Yes, thanks.
- You guys take care.

12:34.233 --> 12:35.233
- Bye.
- Bye.

12:35.233 --> 12:36.233
- Bye.

12:38.100 --> 12:40.233
- So your mom told me she's
gonna give me a baby shower.

12:40.233 --> 12:41.633
- Co-ed baby shower.

12:41.633 --> 12:44.100
The theme is super chic,
super 1960s.

12:44.100 --> 12:45.333
- Well, there's very few things

12:45.333 --> 12:47.100
that I can wear
that look super chic.

12:47.100 --> 12:48.767
- It's just kind of, like,

12:48.767 --> 12:52.066
WASPy/Cote d'Azur wear
from, like, the '60s and '70s.

12:52.066 --> 12:53.233
- Got it.

12:53.233 --> 12:55.033
Tell your mom
I would definitely like to

12:55.033 --> 12:56.633
see everybody
and include everybody.

12:56.633 --> 12:59.100
- Yeah, I don't know.
I mean, Kathryn?

12:59.100 --> 13:00.633
I doubt she'd
want her in the house.

13:00.633 --> 13:02.567
Mom will do whatever she wants,

13:02.567 --> 13:04.233
whether I support it or not.

13:04.233 --> 13:06.300
But everyone else is welcome,
you know.

13:06.300 --> 13:08.633
- Yeah.

13:20.600 --> 13:22.133
- Dave.

13:23.100 --> 13:25.100
Good to see you.

refreshing beverage.

13:26.667 --> 13:28.233
Can you help me with that?

13:28.233 --> 13:30.367

13:32.066 --> 13:33.734

a whole bunch of nothing.

13:35.000 --> 13:36.266

- Good to see you. You too.

13:40.533 --> 13:43.533
- Part of the perk
of the job that I had

13:43.533 --> 13:46.600
was that I'm friends with
the bartenders at every bar.

13:46.600 --> 13:48.667
It's, like, low-key famous.

13:48.667 --> 13:52.033
The downside is,
they know all my business,

13:52.033 --> 13:55.000
so, uh, it's kind of
a give-and-take.

13:56.133 --> 13:57.633
- I feel like it gives us
pretty good ambience, no?

13:57.633 --> 13:59.033
- It is quiet.

13:59.033 --> 14:00.233
- I have a question.

14:00.233 --> 14:02.033
- Are you--like--
this is awesome.

14:02.033 --> 14:03.166
I can, like, check out babes

14:03.166 --> 14:04.633
and, like,
not feel bad about it.

14:04.633 --> 14:06.166
- Eh.

14:06.166 --> 14:08.300
It's not like I was dating
someone that was ugly...

14:08.300 --> 14:10.000
- No, no--look--
- And so I was like,

14:10.000 --> 14:11.633
"Damn, I wish I could go
bang these hot girls."

14:11.633 --> 14:13.233
- I get it. I totally get it.
- So now I'm free, but...

14:13.233 --> 14:16.567
- But, like, the reality is,
now you are single,

14:16.567 --> 14:18.633
and you are in
the dating pool of Charleston.

14:18.633 --> 14:20.100
And it might take you a minute
to get to that point where--

14:20.100 --> 14:21.567
- Right.
- You're taking home a girl.

14:21.567 --> 14:24.233
But the fact of the matter is,
is that you can.

14:24.233 --> 14:26.166
- It makes me want to go back
and be like,

14:26.166 --> 14:28.033
"Hey, any chance
you can make me like guys?

14:28.033 --> 14:29.266
Just make me gay."

14:29.266 --> 14:32.166
Maybe my life would be
a little easier.

14:32.166 --> 14:34.000
But I don't think
it would be, right?

14:34.000 --> 14:36.333
- Well, Craig, uh,
you want to tell me something?

14:38.033 --> 14:39.066
- Oh, my God.

14:39.066 --> 14:40.333
Is this Craig's coming out time?

14:40.333 --> 14:42.000
Like, am I the person

14:42.000 --> 14:43.700
that he feels comfortable
to come out to?

14:43.700 --> 14:45.734
- No, I feel like that would be
a volatile relation.

14:45.734 --> 14:50.333
I'm just don't-- I'm so
different than --girls.

14:50.333 --> 14:52.166
- Hey, gents.
- Oh, Shep.

14:52.166 --> 14:54.433
- Shepard.

14:54.433 --> 14:57.066
- Good.

14:57.066 --> 14:59.433
I don't really remember the end.

14:59.433 --> 15:01.266
I--I feel--I browned out.

15:01.266 --> 15:03.066
You had to have been hammered.

15:03.066 --> 15:04.200
- Not as drunk as you guys.

15:04.200 --> 15:06.066
- Remember when he said to flip

15:06.066 --> 15:08.066
or not to flip on the ribs?

15:08.066 --> 15:11.333
That is the question.

15:11.333 --> 15:14.367
So let's--
- Thanks, ----ing Shakespeare.

15:14.367 --> 15:17.066
I should've called you
Grill Shakespeare.

15:18.233 --> 15:20.066
- A missed opportunity.
- Yes.

15:20.066 --> 15:21.700
- But the food did
turn out somehow.

15:21.700 --> 15:23.700
- Hey, Craig, you did great.
- I have no idea how.

15:23.700 --> 15:25.100
- Hey, all right.

15:25.100 --> 15:26.734
You guys hungry?
Thank you, sir.

15:26.734 --> 15:28.700
- Nachos.
- Yeah, perfect.

15:28.700 --> 15:31.300
- So, like, at the end
of the party,

15:31.300 --> 15:32.767
you know, I may have
walked over.

15:32.767 --> 15:34.633
I could see in her eyes
that it was, like,

15:34.633 --> 15:36.333
nice Naomie, like, sweet,

15:36.333 --> 15:38.767
sensitive, like, vulnerable--
not the mean one.

15:38.767 --> 15:40.233
- It's hard for me
to see you, Craig.

15:40.233 --> 15:42.734
I'm not gonna lie, like--

15:42.734 --> 15:45.200
- It's the first time I actually
saw that she actually

15:45.200 --> 15:46.300
----ing cared, because, like,

15:46.300 --> 15:48.100
she didn't
chase me when I left.

15:48.100 --> 15:50.100
- Look, y'all clearly still
care about each other.

15:50.100 --> 15:51.333
- Right.
- But, like,

15:51.333 --> 15:53.033
when you
break up with someone,

15:53.033 --> 15:54.700
if you continue to talk
to them every day,

15:54.700 --> 15:56.734
then you're not gonna
get over anybody.

15:56.734 --> 15:59.100
- Right now, I just don't have
the closure I need.

15:59.100 --> 16:00.400
It was so obvious
that she didn't want to

16:00.400 --> 16:02.266
be with me anymore,
and then she's gonna cry

16:02.266 --> 16:03.767
and act, like, devastated.

16:03.767 --> 16:06.066
It's really just
a mind .

16:09.066 --> 16:10.266
- I don't know.

16:10.266 --> 16:12.066
- I hear you, man.

16:12.066 --> 16:14.266
Despite what you think,
I root for you, Craig.

16:14.266 --> 16:15.300
- Thank you.
- Yes.

16:17.400 --> 16:20.400
- Maybe that was
symbolic right there.

16:20.400 --> 16:21.667
- Coming up...

16:21.667 --> 16:24.266
- This is blowing my mind.

16:24.266 --> 16:28.033
- I can't even, like, process
the thought that it's my child.

18:03.500 --> 18:05.500
I feel the baby move
all the time,

18:05.500 --> 18:08.100
and it's pretty freaky
when you can actually,

18:08.100 --> 18:10.200
like, see your stomach move.

18:10.200 --> 18:13.300
And it's not gas.
It's a baby.

36:23.300 --> 36:24.533
- No.
No-no-no. I agree.

36:24.533 --> 36:26.266

because, like,

36:26.266 --> 36:27.567
if anyone said that to me,

36:27.567 --> 36:29.166

36:39.667 --> 36:41.433
- Yes, he did.

Not in a mean way, like--

37:01.600 --> 37:03.467

a lot in the last two months.

37:05.467 --> 37:08.166

37:08.166 --> 37:10.200

in the last two months

37:10.200 --> 37:13.567

for almost three years?

37:13.567 --> 37:16.567

a loaded question, Naomie.

37:16.567 --> 37:18.266

done in three years.

37:19.300 --> 37:20.467
- No, I said "more."

37:20.467 --> 37:22.567
I didn't say "something."
I said "more."

37:22.567 --> 37:25.333
I--see, that's, again, you
taking things out of context

37:25.333 --> 37:27.200
that I'm saying.
That's not fair.

37:27.200 --> 37:29.633

do more in two months

37:29.633 --> 37:31.433

When When?

38:00.633 --> 38:02.500

When you would miss meetings.

38:02.500 --> 38:04.433
- Babe, I'm the same person
that I was

38:04.433 --> 38:07.100
that you started dating, that

38:07.100 --> 38:09.233
Then all of a sudden, a year
later, you decide to,

38:09.233 --> 38:10.533
like, not agree
with my lifestyle.

38:10.533 --> 38:12.266
- No, a year later...
- That's not fair.

38:12.266 --> 38:13.633
- I decide that I need to
do sh-- with my life.

38:13.633 --> 38:15.533
- So then--
- I can't just lay around...

38:15.533 --> 38:16.734
- So you do your thing.
- And be hungover every day.

38:16.734 --> 38:18.600
- You need to wake up
and do sh--.

38:18.600 --> 38:20.467
You can do so much more than you
already do and you know that.

38:20.467 --> 38:22.200
I want. I'm an adult.

38:24.400 --> 38:28.400
- You sit home, and you sew,
and you pretend to do things.

38:29.667 --> 38:30.667
Oh, my God, there's more!

38:30.667 --> 38:32.533
What is this?

38:32.533 --> 38:34.233
- That's the actual...
- That's a cat.

38:34.233 --> 38:35.533
is it?
Sorry.

38:35.533 --> 38:37.767
is this?

38:37.767 --> 38:39.667
- And I own two homes,

38:39.667 --> 38:42.400
so tell me
I'm a big loser by 29.

38:42.400 --> 38:43.667
That's--you don't
think rationally.

38:43.667 --> 38:46.133
- It's not about your assets
and what you own.

38:46.133 --> 38:47.467
- Okay, then we think
differently, and that's not

38:47.467 --> 38:48.533
how you were when
we first started dating,

38:48.533 --> 38:49.667
and that's why we had a blast.

38:49.667 --> 38:51.467
- Okay, then we think
differently.

38:51.467 --> 38:53.367
- What, did you not change
a year and a half in?

38:53.367 --> 38:56.300
- Yeah, because I actually got
my sh-- together, unlike you.

38:56.300 --> 38:59.166
- You're still live with--
under your parents.

39:06.300 --> 39:09.433
- Oh! Oh!

39:09.433 --> 39:12.266
I can't breathe.
- Oh, my God.

39:12.266 --> 39:14.300
- It was supposed to be
a teddy bear, I think.

39:14.300 --> 39:15.700
And he--he--
- It was.

39:15.700 --> 39:18.300
- The effort was there.

39:18.300 --> 39:22.533
- Obviously not.

39:22.533 --> 39:23.767
Look at this!

39:23.767 --> 39:25.667
Is this

39:25.667 --> 39:27.567
Oh, my God, that is
the cutest thing ever.

39:27.567 --> 39:29.700
- Aww.

39:29.700 --> 39:33.166
- Thank y'all all so much
for all the sweet presents.

39:33.166 --> 39:34.700
It's so sweet.
- Our pleasure, honey.

39:40.200 --> 39:41.533
- Hey, Miss Patricia.

39:41.533 --> 39:43.200
- My God, look who's here.

39:43.200 --> 39:45.200
- So sorry we're late.

39:45.200 --> 39:46.467
- Hi, darling.

39:46.467 --> 39:48.467
- Dude, JD just got here...

39:48.467 --> 39:50.333
- Oh.
- With Liz.

39:50.333 --> 39:51.700
Like, what the
is she doing?

39:53.600 --> 39:56.033
- Yeah, sorry we're
running behind.

39:56.033 --> 39:58.000
One of those days.
Rush, rush, rush.

39:58.000 --> 39:59.600
- Come on in.
- You look great!

39:59.600 --> 40:01.667
- Liz just came here with JD...

40:01.667 --> 40:03.333
- Making me look like
a .

40:03.333 --> 40:05.200
both: No, it doesn't.
- Yes, it does.

40:05.200 --> 40:06.567
After--listen, after everything
she said to me--

40:06.567 --> 40:07.734
- That's like seven degrees of
separation.

40:07.734 --> 40:09.467
Don't worry about it.

40:09.467 --> 40:11.333
?

40:11.333 --> 40:17.233
How could she walk in
to a party with him, smiling?

40:17.233 --> 40:19.233
- You have to understand
that there have been years

40:19.233 --> 40:20.633
of entrenched marriage.
- Yeah, it's not--

40:20.633 --> 40:22.567
- And whether she has a story,
he has a story,

40:22.567 --> 40:24.467
but there's nothing you can do
that--I mean,

40:24.467 --> 40:26.700
there's something there
that you don't know.

40:26.700 --> 40:29.367
- Keeping up appearances
is important in the South.

40:29.367 --> 40:32.367
Yeah, for sure.
- Okay.

40:32.367 --> 40:33.767
- And by the way,
I'm--I'm just saying--

40:33.767 --> 40:35.433
Do I just greet them?

40:35.433 --> 40:37.767
- You say hello to each of them,
you smile,

40:37.767 --> 40:39.433
you give her a huge hug,

40:39.433 --> 40:41.066
and then you just say,
"Hello, JD."

40:41.066 --> 40:42.500
And he'll--and I swear
he'll be like, "Hi."

40:42.500 --> 40:44.233
- He'll be gracious.
- Yeah.

40:44.233 --> 40:45.633
- Okay, here we go.

40:45.633 --> 40:48.300
- That's all you can do.

40:48.300 --> 40:49.500
- Hi.
- Hey, sweetie.

40:49.500 --> 40:50.533
- You're so cute.

40:52.367 --> 40:54.467
- Yes.
- I missed--okay.

40:54.467 --> 40:55.600
- Well, you should've called me.
I would've told you.

40:56.500 --> 40:58.000
- Hi, JD
- I did not know.

40:59.400 --> 41:01.033
- Good. Good to see you.
- Good. You too.

41:07.600 --> 41:10.400
- JD's smirk,
looking at me like,

41:10.400 --> 41:11.767
"Ha you.
I got her here.

41:11.767 --> 41:14.000
She's here with me."
It's palpable.

41:14.000 --> 41:16.000
My heart is
pounding out of my chest.

41:16.000 --> 41:17.633
I'm so ----ing mad.

41:20.266 --> 41:21.767
- And I know that right now
he feels like

41:21.767 --> 41:23.600
he's winning or something.

41:23.600 --> 41:26.000
I don't know how to explain it.

41:26.000 --> 41:28.000
- That is a gorgeous cake,
Patricia!

41:29.734 --> 41:32.400
- I'm gonna let it go.
I'm gonna let it go.

41:32.400 --> 41:34.633
He knows what he--

41:34.633 --> 41:37.600
He knows what he's doing.
He really does.

41:37.600 --> 41:38.533
- This is the thing,
it's, like,

41:38.533 --> 41:41.300
you did your due
diligence as a friend,

41:41.300 --> 41:43.700
but this isn't
your fight anymore.

41:43.700 --> 41:45.633
- All right,
so let's charge out

41:45.633 --> 41:47.433
'cause I don't want to get
pulled into that conversation.

41:47.433 --> 41:49.033
- Okay, I got to run.
- All right, hon.

41:49.033 --> 41:50.567
- Good to see you guys.
- Thanks, y'all.

41:50.567 --> 41:51.567
- Thanks for having me.
- Good to see everybody.

41:53.700 --> 41:57.533
I'm going to grab your present.

41:57.533 --> 41:58.700
joke.
- Not cool.

41:58.700 --> 42:00.567
- Stop.
Don't do that.

42:00.567 --> 42:01.700
Okay, I love you guys.

42:01.700 --> 42:04.433
♪ ♪

42:04.433 --> 42:07.667
- On the next episode of
"Southern Charm"...

42:07.667 --> 42:09.567
- I don't even know how long
you guys have been together.

42:09.567 --> 42:11.100
I don't know
when you met my kids.

42:11.100 --> 42:13.433
- The first time I had
an interaction was,

42:13.433 --> 42:16.000
like, Mother's Day.

42:16.000 --> 42:18.667
- W--I definitely want to be
an united front with Elizabeth.

42:18.667 --> 42:20.500
- If you're single,
why act like married?

42:20.500 --> 42:21.600
Yeah.

42:21.600 --> 42:25.066
- You got that good vibrator.

42:25.066 --> 42:28.667
- Mine's even waterproof.
It goes with me everywhere.

42:28.667 --> 42:30.333
- I'm horrified right now.

42:30.333 --> 42:34.333
- I heard you had a date with

42:34.333 --> 42:36.667
our new friend, uh, Payton.
- Oh, God.

42:39.000 --> 42:41.467
- And I just worry
I'm gonna be 40 years old,

42:41.467 --> 42:43.433
and I'm still gonna
be in this, like,

42:43.433 --> 42:46.000
"not wanting to
settle down" mode.

42:46.000 --> 42:48.333
- Not everybody's meant
to be married and have kids.

42:48.333 --> 42:50.600
- But you know that
that would bother you.

42:50.600 --> 42:52.400
- You want to quit this
relationship.

42:52.400 --> 42:54.600
You want to puss out,
and you don't want to try.

42:54.600 --> 42:58.133
- Because you're all talk,
no action.

42:58.133 --> 42:59.567
- That is awful.
