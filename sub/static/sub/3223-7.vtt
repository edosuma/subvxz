WEBVTT

00:04.800 --> 00:07.883
No. Stop. Stop. Not Leviathans.

00:08.039 --> 00:10.361
- What happened?
- I went to purgatory. Sam hit a dog.

00:10.520 --> 00:13.046
Crowley kidnapped you. I saw.
But you escaped. How?

00:13.280 --> 00:16.045
There was a tablet.
I told Crowley I was opening a hell gate...

00:16.239 --> 00:19.562
...but I was reading from another chapter:
"How to Destroy Demons."

00:20.560 --> 00:22.289
- Hi, Mom.
- Kevin.

00:24.640 --> 00:27.291
- She's clean.
- Who is this lovely young thing?

00:27.440 --> 00:30.091
Unh! Stay away from my son.

00:30.840 --> 00:32.968
Hello, boys.

00:35.320 --> 00:38.881
Good luck closing the gates to hell
without this.

00:39.040 --> 00:40.610
Kevin! You gotta be kidding me.

00:40.800 --> 00:43.690
- Kevin figures we don't need him.
- Crowley still does.

00:43.840 --> 00:46.161
You're an angel?
You're chasing the magic rock.

00:46.320 --> 00:48.607
- We protect the word of God.
- Cass didn't make it.

00:48.800 --> 00:50.165
Dean!

00:56.000 --> 00:57.570
Push me. Push me. Higher.

01:07.920 --> 01:09.445
I'll be next.

01:10.520 --> 01:11.965
Jessica, come on.

01:12.120 --> 01:15.124
It's finger painting, Aaron,
not body painting.

01:15.320 --> 01:16.924
Let's get you cleaned up.

01:25.720 --> 01:27.484
There you go.

01:38.960 --> 01:40.769
What is it?

01:42.080 --> 01:43.650
It's getting closer.

03:10.080 --> 03:13.721
Hey.

03:15.040 --> 03:17.042
You look like you've s... I was gonna say:

03:17.200 --> 03:21.364
"You look like you've seen a ghost,"
but you'd probably be stoked. Uh, you okay?

03:22.240 --> 03:24.163
Yeah, I'm cool.

03:24.320 --> 03:25.924
What's up?

03:26.440 --> 03:29.603
Well, this kid went missing
from a preschool.

03:29.760 --> 03:30.886
That sucks. And?

03:31.040 --> 03:33.884
And at the same time he vanished,
a surprise tornado hit...

03:34.040 --> 03:39.729
...lasted maybe 20 seconds,
then, uh, shazaam, back to perfect weather.

03:39.880 --> 03:43.566
- Hmm. And they pooh-pooh climate change.
- Yeah.

03:43.720 --> 03:47.122
Similar wackiness has happened
over the past few weeks in other places.

03:47.280 --> 03:50.602
Tulsa, a bus driver vanishes
and a river gets overrun with frogs.

03:50.760 --> 03:54.401
New Mexico, a mailman disappears,
the earth splits open.

03:56.080 --> 03:59.402
All right. So you thinking demons?

03:59.960 --> 04:03.601
Yeah. Possibly.
But, I mean, this stuff was major.

04:03.800 --> 04:05.450
These folks have nothing in common.

04:05.640 --> 04:08.962
No religious affiliations.
Different hometowns. All ages.

04:09.120 --> 04:10.451
Why would demons want them?

04:10.640 --> 04:12.290
Why do demons want anything?

04:13.760 --> 04:16.127
Uh, so we on this?

04:16.640 --> 04:17.846
Yeah. Ahem.

04:26.240 --> 04:28.447
What do you want?

04:28.880 --> 04:31.087
I've given you all the names.

04:31.240 --> 04:33.971
No, no, no...

04:34.120 --> 04:37.442
...and no. That's not what I wanna hear.

04:40.960 --> 04:44.965
This hurts you more than it hurts me,
so I can go on forever.

04:45.440 --> 04:49.650
Which in your case,
forever means, well, forever.

04:50.400 --> 04:52.846
When the angels find out
what you're doing...

04:53.000 --> 04:55.321
They'll be what? Put out?

04:55.520 --> 04:59.491
I'm quaking. Really. The power grid
is so whacked out in heaven...

04:59.640 --> 05:03.167
...they don't even know you're not there.
So on the count of three.

05:03.360 --> 05:05.806
One, two...

05:09.480 --> 05:11.005
What happened to three?

05:11.200 --> 05:14.363
I lied. I do that.
Just give me the other names.

05:14.840 --> 05:18.083
There are no other names.

05:18.760 --> 05:22.048
The next generation isn't born yet.

05:24.880 --> 05:26.006
Truth?

05:28.000 --> 05:29.445
Truth.

05:31.640 --> 05:35.964
Well, I suppose there's no reason
to keep torturing you, then.

05:43.400 --> 05:46.006
Once you get going,
it's really hard to stop.

05:54.880 --> 05:56.166
Keep him on ice.

05:56.320 --> 05:59.210
We've only just scratched the surface
with this one.

06:06.680 --> 06:10.321
I hope the ruckus down the hall
wasn't too off-putting.

06:10.480 --> 06:14.644
Construction standards aren't what
they were during the Inquisition.

06:19.760 --> 06:22.730
I see. No niceties.

06:23.400 --> 06:28.361
All right, then. I suppose you're wondering
why I convened this motley group.

06:33.040 --> 06:37.443
Mom! You've got to stop drowning me
in holy water every time I go out.

06:39.600 --> 06:41.125
I'm not possessed.

06:41.280 --> 06:43.362
Not yet. Not now.

06:43.920 --> 06:47.367
- They got to me, remember?
- We've got hex bags that make us invisible...

06:47.520 --> 06:50.603
...to demons, we've got demon traps
painted everywhere.

06:50.800 --> 06:54.441
I've got a sigil tattooed on my arm.
If we just keep moving, we'll be fine.

06:54.640 --> 06:58.122
And keep living in rat-infested hovels
and running from cursed creatures?

06:58.280 --> 07:00.044
This is no life.

07:00.200 --> 07:03.568
It's my life.
I'm the one dragging the prophet load.

07:03.720 --> 07:06.610
- I'm sorry I pulled you into it.
- Don't be sorry. Be ready.

07:06.760 --> 07:09.331
We've gotta stop running
and start taking a stand.

07:09.480 --> 07:11.926
- Okay, you know that's crazy.
- No, it's not.

07:12.080 --> 07:14.765
Not if we have the bomb you used
on Crowley's demons.

07:14.920 --> 07:17.651
The thing I made had ingredients
from all over the world.

07:17.800 --> 07:21.486
- All right? Demons had to get the stuff.
- That's why I went to an expert.

07:21.680 --> 07:23.728
What? Who?

07:24.080 --> 07:25.320
I hired a witch.

07:25.480 --> 07:27.482
- A witch?
- Off of Craigslist.

07:27.640 --> 07:30.644
Her name is Delta Mendota,
and she is a smart cookie.

07:30.840 --> 07:35.323
She's scrappy, reliable,
and she's willing to kill.

07:37.480 --> 07:40.802
Look, I'm your mother
and I did this for you.

07:41.400 --> 07:43.607
Okay, what makes you think
you can trust her?

07:43.760 --> 07:48.004
I don't. That's why I didn't give her the exact
quantities or tell her how to blend them.

07:48.200 --> 07:51.170
- She's in the dark.
- You told her we were making demon bombs.

07:51.360 --> 07:53.727
Yeah, and that got her super motivated.

07:53.920 --> 07:57.163
Oh! Time for Delta to check in.

07:58.600 --> 07:59.840
Oh, my God.

08:10.040 --> 08:11.530
Hi, Mrs. Tran.

08:12.600 --> 08:15.444
Is that your son? Hi, Kevin.

08:16.160 --> 08:19.960
Hi, Delta. Bring us up to speed.
You got all the stuff?

08:20.120 --> 08:25.001
Almost. I don't suppose you'd tell me
the recipe for these bombs?

08:25.520 --> 08:26.681
You know the rules.

08:26.840 --> 08:30.811
Casual encounters.
That means no questions asked.

08:30.960 --> 08:33.804
No, Mom, that's another part of Craigslist.

08:36.799 --> 08:39.565
- How long have you been a witch?
- A full witch?

08:39.760 --> 08:41.091
Since the band broke up.

08:41.640 --> 08:43.802
- You were in a band?
- Look, guys...

08:44.000 --> 08:46.367
...I take my witch business real serious.

08:46.520 --> 08:50.491
I'm on it,
and it's gonna be wicked awesome, okay?

09:08.560 --> 09:10.369
Mrs. Hagar? Agents Roth and Malloy.

09:10.520 --> 09:13.842
We wanna speak to you
about Aaron Webber's abduction.

09:14.920 --> 09:17.082
Like I told the police...

09:17.320 --> 09:19.766
...one minute I was taking Aaron
to get cleaned up...

09:19.920 --> 09:23.367
...and the next minute,
I woke up in a park three blocks away.

09:23.520 --> 09:26.410
- You have no memory of what happened?
- No.

09:26.560 --> 09:28.244
He was just gone.

09:28.400 --> 09:32.246
Can you think of any reason why somebody
would wanna harm him? Any enemies?

09:32.400 --> 09:34.801
Enemies? He's 5.

09:38.120 --> 09:41.249
- Excuse me?
- It's code. For your own safety.

09:41.400 --> 09:44.210
So you can't reveal anything
under enhanced interrogation.

09:44.360 --> 09:47.330
When you woke up on the floor
were there any signs of struggle?

09:47.880 --> 09:48.927
No.

09:49.960 --> 09:51.564
Smell like sulfur?

09:53.480 --> 09:55.130
How did you know that?

09:57.280 --> 09:59.487
Lucky guess. Ahem. Thanks for your time.

10:03.600 --> 10:06.729
- No reaction to the exorcism.
- Yeah, not possessed at the moment.

10:06.880 --> 10:09.724
But I'm willing to bet a demon got ahold
of Aaron Webber.

10:40.720 --> 10:44.202
Dean? What's going on? You all right?

10:46.640 --> 10:50.565
I don't know. I think I just saw something.

10:51.160 --> 10:52.366
Uh...

10:52.520 --> 10:54.443
You saw what?

10:56.880 --> 10:58.530
Cass.

11:00.480 --> 11:02.050
Cass?

11:02.520 --> 11:04.045
Where?

11:05.880 --> 11:07.211
Right there.

11:09.560 --> 11:12.530
And earlier, on the road.

11:13.520 --> 11:15.727
I feel like I keep seeing him.

11:17.080 --> 11:19.731
That's not possible.

11:19.880 --> 11:22.201
I mean, you said it yourself.

11:22.360 --> 11:25.603
You made it out and he didn't, right?

11:28.720 --> 11:31.246
I tried so damn hard
to get us the hell out of there.

11:32.560 --> 11:34.722
I know you did.

11:39.240 --> 11:41.607
You know, I could have pulled him out.

11:42.480 --> 11:45.643
I just don't understand
why he didn't try harder.

11:46.400 --> 11:48.004
Dean.

11:49.400 --> 11:51.926
You did everything you could.

11:54.520 --> 11:57.126
Yeah, then why do I feel like crap?

12:00.320 --> 12:02.402
Survivor's guilt?

12:02.600 --> 12:03.931
Hmm.

12:05.320 --> 12:07.766
If you let it, this is gonna keep
messing with you.

12:07.920 --> 12:09.922
You gotta walk past it.

12:25.920 --> 12:28.241
- We're getting close.
- Really?

12:28.400 --> 12:32.007
I don't see crap. What the hell
is this escape hatch supposed to look like?

12:32.160 --> 12:34.083
He doesn't know.

12:34.840 --> 12:37.127
You drove me through the fire.
Tell me you know.

12:37.280 --> 12:39.647
- It's here. They promised.
- Oh, they?

12:39.800 --> 12:41.290
That's comforting.

12:41.440 --> 12:43.807
Well, even if it does exist...

12:43.960 --> 12:46.486
Broken record, Cass.

12:47.320 --> 12:50.767
Dean, it's a human portal.

12:50.920 --> 12:55.164
- There's no proof that an angel can pass.
- Stow it, Cass. You're coming. That's final.

12:55.320 --> 12:57.004
I'm just saying...

12:57.960 --> 12:59.121
...if it doesn't work...

13:01.480 --> 13:03.323
...thank you.

13:03.480 --> 13:05.005
For everything.

13:05.160 --> 13:07.811
Save the Hallmark. Okay?

13:07.960 --> 13:11.681
It's gonna work. Nobody gets left behind.

13:17.360 --> 13:20.682
Hope you enjoyed
our orange juice and pancakes.

13:20.840 --> 13:23.366
Best to pack in those carbs in the morning,
you know.

13:23.520 --> 13:24.681
Are we on a spaceship?

13:25.120 --> 13:27.691
- Sorry?
- Snapping us up from our homes...

13:27.840 --> 13:29.046
...our families.

13:29.240 --> 13:32.005
Teleporting us to this mother ship.

13:32.200 --> 13:35.044
- Mother ship.
- You're aliens, right?

13:38.720 --> 13:41.041
Possibly a long shot.

13:42.040 --> 13:44.407
Does this mean anything to you?

13:47.520 --> 13:48.885
I don't read Chinese.

13:49.520 --> 13:52.490
Talk about the dumbing down of America.

13:52.920 --> 13:55.924
Anyone? Come on. It's fun. Give it a go.

13:57.720 --> 14:00.883
You hapless toads are utterly clueless,
aren't you?

14:03.000 --> 14:06.891
I got a wife and kids.
I got bills. I can't miss work.

14:07.040 --> 14:08.849
- Sir...
- I got rights.

14:10.240 --> 14:11.890
Where's my one phone call?

14:22.080 --> 14:24.082
Anyone else want to complain?

14:26.560 --> 14:28.961
- Hmm?
- Um...

14:34.400 --> 14:36.641
We hold this...

14:36.800 --> 14:41.522
Um, maybe "these."... truths to be...

14:41.680 --> 14:43.250
Oh, ha.

14:43.440 --> 14:45.966
Oh, right. That's better. Yeah.

14:54.760 --> 14:56.603
Hi. It's Kevin, right?

14:59.440 --> 15:01.329
So I was...

15:01.720 --> 15:03.449
What the hell?

15:03.600 --> 15:06.410
- And my mother you've met.
- Yeah.

15:07.920 --> 15:10.161
- You have everything?
- You bet.

15:10.320 --> 15:11.970
It was a bitch, but so worth it.

15:12.120 --> 15:15.920
Honestly, I am sick of being
treated like dirt by those demons.

15:16.080 --> 15:18.287
Like, who died and made them boss?

15:18.440 --> 15:20.408
Well, probably somebody did.

15:20.600 --> 15:23.080
But they could use a serious
attitude reduction.

15:23.240 --> 15:26.608
Kev, where's the ladies' room?
Long drive, and, you know.

15:26.760 --> 15:27.966
- Over there.
- Cool.

15:28.120 --> 15:31.841
Delta, what is this? I was clear.
I need to build an arsenal.

15:32.000 --> 15:33.650
This maybe gets me one weapon.

15:33.800 --> 15:36.485
It's a taste of what you'll get
when I get paid in full.

15:36.640 --> 15:38.324
That was not the agreement.

15:38.960 --> 15:40.246
It is now.

15:49.880 --> 15:50.961
Kevin.

15:51.240 --> 15:52.810
Forget it.

15:56.160 --> 15:59.562
Hey, so it's not just Americans
who are vanishing.

15:59.760 --> 16:05.642
This guy, Luigi Ponzi, disappeared walking
between two subway cars in Rome.

16:05.800 --> 16:08.326
And right above ground
there was a freak hail storm.

16:08.480 --> 16:12.280
Are we going to Rome?
That wouldn't be too shabby.

16:20.080 --> 16:21.366
Hello, Dean.

16:22.320 --> 16:26.689
Unbelievable, man.
I cannot believe it. You're actually here.

16:27.520 --> 16:30.524
Yeah, I've been trying to reach out,
but for whatever reason...

16:30.680 --> 16:33.889
...I wasn't at full power,
so I couldn't connect with you.

16:34.040 --> 16:37.249
That must've been why
you kept seeing him. I mean, you think?

16:37.400 --> 16:39.084
Yeah.

16:39.920 --> 16:44.562
I gotta be honest. I'm thinking,
how the hell did you make it out?

16:45.080 --> 16:49.165
I mean, I was there. I know that place.

16:49.360 --> 16:55.527
I know how we had to scratch and claw
and kill and bleed...

16:55.680 --> 16:59.401
...to find that portal and make it
through it, and it almost finished me.

17:03.680 --> 17:05.329
So, uh, heh...

17:05.720 --> 17:09.041
So how exactly are you sitting here
with us right now?

17:12.319 --> 17:15.801
Dean, everything you just said
is completely true.

17:15.960 --> 17:18.566
And that's the strange part.

17:19.079 --> 17:20.411
I have no idea.

17:23.040 --> 17:27.602
I remember endlessly running
and hiding from Leviathan...

17:27.760 --> 17:30.889
...and then I was on the side of the road
in Illinois and...

17:31.240 --> 17:32.765
And that was it.

17:34.200 --> 17:35.770
And that was it.

17:35.920 --> 17:37.604
Yes.

17:46.760 --> 17:48.125
Um...

17:48.640 --> 17:50.768
I'm dirty.

17:53.120 --> 17:54.565
Purgatory will do that to you.

18:13.880 --> 18:16.770
Maybe you were lied to.
Maybe there is no seam.

18:16.920 --> 18:18.649
I lie. I don't get lied to.

18:19.480 --> 18:21.608
Aren't you guys all about faith?

18:21.760 --> 18:23.967
Not particularly.

18:35.320 --> 18:37.846
Oh, ye of frigging little faith.

18:38.000 --> 18:41.641
- What the hell?
- There it is. It's reacting to you.

18:45.480 --> 18:47.005
All right, are you ready?

18:47.160 --> 18:49.208
Just like we talked about.

18:55.200 --> 18:57.202
Putting a lot of trust in you, brother.

18:58.040 --> 18:59.326
You earned it.

19:05.320 --> 19:07.049
I'll see you on the other side.

19:27.040 --> 19:28.166
Let's go.

19:39.280 --> 19:41.248
Dean.

19:41.400 --> 19:42.686
Wait.

19:47.520 --> 19:49.249
Dean?

19:50.000 --> 19:52.571
- Huh?
- Are you all right?

19:56.560 --> 20:00.531
You do see something
severely wrong here, right?

20:01.240 --> 20:05.040
Sammy, I remember every second
of leaving that place.

20:05.200 --> 20:10.081
I mean, I remember the heat, the stink,
the pain, the fear.

20:12.600 --> 20:16.924
I have that whole ugly mess right here.
And he says he has no idea how he got out.

20:17.080 --> 20:18.605
I'm just not buying it.

20:18.760 --> 20:21.809
- So you think he's lying?
- I'm saying something else happened.

20:22.280 --> 20:24.009
I saw the shape that he was in.

20:24.760 --> 20:28.401
I mean, there was no way
he was fighting his ass out alone. No way.

20:28.560 --> 20:31.723
All right. So who...

20:32.400 --> 20:34.289
...or what, got him out?

20:35.640 --> 20:37.768
Yeah. Exactly.

20:45.400 --> 20:46.970
Better?

20:57.280 --> 20:58.964
Listen, you little skank...

20:59.120 --> 21:02.966
in the service industry, you always deliver
the goods, then you get paid.

21:03.120 --> 21:04.610
Even hookers know that.

21:04.800 --> 21:06.484
Hmm. Says you.

21:06.640 --> 21:11.567
See, my sister's a hooker, so hookers
get paid first and then you get the goods.

21:11.720 --> 21:13.927
Look, I'm not the one
with demons on my ass.

21:14.120 --> 21:17.567
You wanna renege on our deal,
that's fine by me.

21:20.720 --> 21:22.643
Kevin, bring me my purse.

21:28.520 --> 21:30.170
Your mother must be so proud.

21:30.320 --> 21:33.961
She is. Of course, with my sister,
the bar ain't real high.

21:44.440 --> 21:46.920
Did you break the salt line
by the store-room window?

21:47.080 --> 21:49.651
- What? Of course not.
- Ahem.

21:51.160 --> 21:52.525
I wouldn't bother, Kevin.

21:52.680 --> 21:53.841
There's no rush.

21:54.080 --> 21:56.606
- Hello, Delta.
- Hi.

21:57.040 --> 21:59.771
- You betrayed us?
- Delta, how could you?

21:59.960 --> 22:01.450
I'm mercurial.

22:01.600 --> 22:05.810
I'm afraid Delta found you to be a difficult
and ungrateful employer, Mrs. Tran.

22:05.960 --> 22:10.727
She felt she'd gain far more leverage
by negotiating with me.

22:10.880 --> 22:13.565
I am, after all, the king of hell.

22:13.960 --> 22:16.122
And you are a mom.

22:17.840 --> 22:20.002
I did good, didn't I, Your Majesty?

22:20.480 --> 22:22.369
Yes. Very.

22:24.560 --> 22:25.721
Presumptuous twit.

22:25.880 --> 22:29.248
Please, take me. Leave my son alone.

22:29.400 --> 22:32.563
You? What would I do with you?

22:34.360 --> 22:36.408
Kill her and destroy the makings
for the spell.

22:36.560 --> 22:37.891
- No.
- Yes. Say goodbye to Mommy.

23:01.080 --> 23:02.923
What's the latest?

23:03.440 --> 23:06.250
The latest is nothing.

23:06.520 --> 23:07.726
It's like it all stopped.

23:07.880 --> 23:11.726
No freak disappearances linked
to any freak natural events.

23:11.880 --> 23:14.281
- So how many we got, seven?
- Yeah, uh...

23:14.440 --> 23:17.444
- Luigi. Justin. Aaron. Maria. Den...
- Maria. Dennis.

23:17.640 --> 23:19.449
Krista. Sven.

23:21.760 --> 23:23.967
- I missed television.
- Wait, Cass.

23:24.120 --> 23:26.122
How'd you know those are their names?

23:26.280 --> 23:27.964
- Well, they're prophets.
- Prophets?

23:28.120 --> 23:32.091
Angels instinctively know the names of
every prophet. Past, present, and future.

23:32.240 --> 23:35.608
So this list has the name
of every one of them that exists?

23:35.760 --> 23:39.207
Yes. Until the next generation is born.
Plus Kevin Tran, of course.

23:39.360 --> 23:45.208
The other seven are future prophets,
since, uh, only one can exist at a time.

23:45.400 --> 23:49.166
How is Kevin a prophet
if Chuck is a prophet?

23:49.800 --> 23:52.690
I'm not sure what happened to Chuck...

23:52.960 --> 23:54.166
...but he must be dead.

23:54.880 --> 23:57.611
So the next one comes off the bench
if Kevin goes down?

23:57.760 --> 24:00.650
Exactly. They have no idea who they are,
of course.

24:02.000 --> 24:04.002
Crowley.

24:04.800 --> 24:07.167
Insurance. Boy, he's getting desperate.

24:07.320 --> 24:09.288
Explains all the weird phenomena.

24:09.440 --> 24:12.091
Lower level demons nabbing
heavy duty cargo.

24:12.240 --> 24:14.322
The vessels of God's word. Boom.

24:15.000 --> 24:16.809
I get the feeling something's going on.

24:22.120 --> 24:23.849
Hello.

24:24.120 --> 24:27.249
Mrs. Tran.
Well, where the hell have you...?

24:27.840 --> 24:29.683
What?

24:29.840 --> 24:31.808
Crowley's got Kevin.

24:31.960 --> 24:36.204
So, Kevin, as you can see,
our relationship is much simpler now.

24:36.360 --> 24:40.160
You either help me, or you die.

24:40.320 --> 24:44.041
And one of these fine specimens
takes your place.

24:45.680 --> 24:49.287
- I don't quite understand your hesitation.
- You just killed my mother.

24:50.200 --> 24:52.043
Very unfortunate.

24:52.240 --> 24:57.246
But to be fair,
she was plotting to kill me and my kind.

24:58.360 --> 25:00.044
Kevin.

25:00.240 --> 25:02.049
Kev.

25:03.200 --> 25:06.249
I can do a great deal
for a plucky lad like you.

25:06.800 --> 25:10.009
You'll just kill me
as soon as I read the tablet.

25:11.400 --> 25:15.564
Are all young people so horribly cynical?

25:17.240 --> 25:19.641
Depresses me, Kevin.

25:25.200 --> 25:26.406
Here's the thing.

25:26.720 --> 25:33.569
I really want you to read the tablet because,
frankly, this lot failed to inspire.

25:34.400 --> 25:35.765
However...

25:35.920 --> 25:39.891
...better a stupid prophet than
a stubborn prophet, as the saying goes.

25:41.280 --> 25:43.328
So, what's it gonna be?

25:45.920 --> 25:48.571
Perhaps you doubt that I'm serious.

26:09.680 --> 26:10.966
So...

26:11.120 --> 26:13.248
...read any good tablets, lately?

26:17.600 --> 26:19.568
Where the hell is she?

26:19.760 --> 26:21.205
She'll be here.

26:21.360 --> 26:26.571
Look, mile marker 96
was kind of the halfway point.

27:08.160 --> 27:11.881
We gotta move! The portal's closing!

27:15.320 --> 27:16.924
Cass, damn it! Come on!

27:25.840 --> 27:27.365
Come on!

27:29.000 --> 27:30.684
I got you! Hold on!

27:30.880 --> 27:33.963
- Dean!
- Hold on!

27:34.760 --> 27:38.651
Dean!

27:42.440 --> 27:44.966
Cass, can I talk to you outside?

27:53.840 --> 27:55.205
What?

27:55.440 --> 27:57.363
Exactly. What?

27:57.520 --> 27:59.568
What the hell happened?

27:59.720 --> 28:02.041
Back there, purgatory.

28:02.240 --> 28:04.208
I told you I would get you out.

28:04.360 --> 28:06.408
We were there...

28:06.560 --> 28:10.406
...and it's like you just gave up. It's
like you didn't believe we could do it.

28:10.560 --> 28:12.801
You kept saying
you didn't think it would work.

28:13.000 --> 28:14.843
- Did you not trust me?
- Dean...

28:15.040 --> 28:18.249
I did everything I could do to get you out.
Everything.

28:21.320 --> 28:23.721
I did not leave you.

28:25.400 --> 28:28.370
So you think this was your fault?

28:46.000 --> 28:48.571
You can do this, can't you?
You can get him back?

28:48.720 --> 28:52.361
- How did Crowley find you?
- Oh, I hired a witch and she ratted us out.

28:53.760 --> 28:55.922
A Witch?

28:56.600 --> 29:00.047
- Why'd you hire a witch?
- To make demon bombs, of course.

29:01.400 --> 29:02.606
These are Kevin's notes.

29:03.960 --> 29:05.928
You have any idea
where Crowley took him?

29:06.080 --> 29:07.650
No, but, uh...

29:10.120 --> 29:11.406
...this guy might-

29:16.280 --> 29:17.645
Ah.

29:21.040 --> 29:22.326
Let's talk.

29:28.240 --> 29:31.130
I thought privacy
might make it easier to chat.

29:32.520 --> 29:34.648
Decision time, Kevin.

29:34.800 --> 29:36.564
How's this going to go?

29:40.120 --> 29:44.523
Don't be recalcitrant, Kevin.
You know it brings out the worst in me.

29:54.680 --> 29:56.409
All right!

29:56.600 --> 29:58.329
Enough.

30:00.520 --> 30:01.567
I'll do it.

30:12.800 --> 30:17.408
Next is "The Demonic Influence
on the Collective Tapestry of the Soul."

30:17.560 --> 30:18.686
Blah, blah, blah.

30:18.840 --> 30:20.683
Doesn't anyone ever edit this stuff?

30:20.880 --> 30:23.486
So far, as a writer, God's a snooze.

30:24.040 --> 30:26.486
- No fun at parties, I hear
- Um...

30:26.640 --> 30:28.768
"Demonic Transport
to the Regions of Hell."

30:28.920 --> 30:30.684
Tell me something I don't know.

30:30.840 --> 30:34.208
Think macro. This is stupefyingly micro.

30:34.360 --> 30:37.045
- How macro?
- Game changing.

30:56.160 --> 30:58.731
- I'm sorry, Mrs. Tran.
- Wait, what?

31:01.360 --> 31:02.407
This it?

31:04.440 --> 31:05.521
Yes.

31:05.680 --> 31:07.250
My son is in there.

31:07.400 --> 31:11.291
Which means Crowley already has leverage.
He doesn't need another hostage.

31:17.080 --> 31:19.287
Oh, come on.

31:22.440 --> 31:23.930
Yes.

31:24.600 --> 31:25.806
Well...

31:28.680 --> 31:32.207
Don't provoke me, Kevin.
You still have nine fingers.

31:34.120 --> 31:38.762
This section has to do with building
defensive weapons against demons.

31:38.920 --> 31:42.402
Mm-hm.
You're familiar with that one, I believe.

31:44.600 --> 31:46.284
This one...

31:47.080 --> 31:48.923
...describes...

31:50.240 --> 31:52.447
...sealing the gates of hell.

31:53.800 --> 31:57.122
So it's true. It's there.

31:58.920 --> 32:03.130
Clearly, humans cannot possess this thing.
What was God thinking?

32:03.280 --> 32:05.169
We'll get back to that.

32:05.360 --> 32:07.931
Just getting to the sexy part.

32:47.560 --> 32:49.881
All right, I'll check that way.

32:51.680 --> 32:54.524
Hold on. This is different, it's not text.

32:54.680 --> 32:56.364
It's like a personal note.

32:56.520 --> 32:58.488
A personal note from God?

32:58.640 --> 32:59.971
From...

33:00.360 --> 33:02.203
...the Archangel...

33:02.360 --> 33:03.407
Metatron

33:03.800 --> 33:04.847
The scribe.

33:06.480 --> 33:08.403
And suck-up.

33:08.560 --> 33:10.722
Took down God's word,
picked up his cleaning.

33:10.920 --> 33:13.002
It's like a farewell note.

33:13.160 --> 33:14.366
Go on.

33:27.720 --> 33:32.567
"Upon completion of this task, I take
my leave of my master and this world."

33:39.040 --> 33:40.246
Winchester.

33:40.840 --> 33:42.251
Looks like you guys got me.

34:04.960 --> 34:06.405
We're very near Kevin.

34:12.760 --> 34:14.603
Oh, no.

34:17.639 --> 34:20.688
Hey. Uh...

34:21.880 --> 34:23.085
I'm here to help.

34:51.639 --> 34:53.130
What the hell's going on?

34:53.280 --> 34:55.806
You're not all the way back, are you?

34:55.960 --> 35:01.967
"So ends the transcription of the sacred
word for the defense of mankind.

35:02.160 --> 35:06.961
Into the hands of God's children
thus passes the compendium of tablets."

35:07.160 --> 35:08.321
Compendium?

35:08.480 --> 35:10.687
It's a collection of things.
Especially one...

35:10.920 --> 35:13.491
I know what "compendium" means, Kevin.

35:13.640 --> 35:15.130
What does Metatron mean?

35:21.400 --> 35:23.971
- Unh! It's not working.
- Dean, I'm going in.

35:25.720 --> 35:27.404
Cass, no. You're not strong enough.

35:28.000 --> 35:29.843
There are more tablets.

35:30.000 --> 35:34.164
More than "Leviathan" and "Demon."

35:39.480 --> 35:41.050
Castiel.

35:41.240 --> 35:43.049
Fresh from purgatory.

35:43.240 --> 35:45.322
Wish you'd called first.

35:45.480 --> 35:46.686
Crowley.

35:46.840 --> 35:49.411
Which Castiel is it this time?
I'm never sure.

35:49.560 --> 35:51.562
Madman or megalomaniac?

35:52.240 --> 35:54.163
Kevin is coming with me.

35:54.320 --> 35:55.890
I think not.

35:56.040 --> 35:58.850
The prophet's playing on my team now.

36:09.520 --> 36:10.885
So this is how it's gonna be?

36:11.040 --> 36:14.249
Well, it's all very West Side Story,
but let's be logical.

36:14.480 --> 36:17.563
You look like hell, and I should know.

36:17.720 --> 36:19.210
You're not up for this.

36:23.240 --> 36:27.290
Maybe you can get it up,
but you can't keep it up.

36:34.200 --> 36:37.727
- You're bluffing.
- You wanna take that chance?

37:03.000 --> 37:06.402
The cops are on their way.
They're gonna pick up the prophets.

37:06.560 --> 37:08.289
They'll all be heading home.

37:08.480 --> 37:09.527
What about us?

37:09.680 --> 37:12.729
I called a friend of ours, Garth.
He does what we do.

37:12.880 --> 37:15.121
Well, in his own way.

37:15.280 --> 37:18.568
He'll keep an eye on you guys.
No more going off on your own.

37:21.200 --> 37:25.205
You get that it was hiring that witch
that got you into all this, right?

37:28.640 --> 37:30.051
How you holding up, Kev?

37:30.200 --> 37:31.725
You kidding?

37:32.400 --> 37:34.971
I wanna seal those bastards up forever.

37:35.120 --> 37:36.645
He took my finger.

37:37.760 --> 37:39.762
Cass thinks he might be able to fix that.

37:40.880 --> 37:43.770
In the meantime,
just lay low till we get back to you, okay?

37:44.240 --> 37:47.323
That was a bonehead move back there.
You could've gotten killed.

37:47.480 --> 37:51.326
- Why didn't you wait for me?
- Well, I didn't get killed. And it worked.

37:51.480 --> 37:54.086
- And if it didn't?
- It would have been my problem.

37:54.240 --> 37:58.928
- Well, that's not the way I see it.
- Hey, everything isn't your responsibility.

37:59.080 --> 38:01.082
Getting me out of purgatory
wasn't your responsibility.

38:01.240 --> 38:04.005
You didn't get out. So whose fault was it?

38:04.160 --> 38:08.324
It's not about fault. It's about will.

38:09.320 --> 38:11.004
Dean, do you really not remember?

38:12.080 --> 38:14.811
I lived it, Cass. Okay?
I know what happened.

38:14.960 --> 38:16.485
No.

38:16.640 --> 38:20.167
No, you think you know.
You remembered it the way you needed to.

38:20.320 --> 38:25.850
Look, I don't need to feel like hell
for failing you, okay?

38:26.000 --> 38:29.368
For failing you like I've failed every
other godforsaken thing I care about.

38:29.560 --> 38:30.607
I don't need it.

38:30.760 --> 38:32.967
Dean, just look at it.

38:33.520 --> 38:35.841
Really look at it.

38:38.760 --> 38:41.684
Cass, damn it! Come on!

38:49.360 --> 38:50.725
Come on!

38:52.360 --> 38:54.124
I got you! Hold on!

38:54.280 --> 38:57.682
- Dean!
- Hold on!

38:57.840 --> 38:59.330
Dean.

39:01.200 --> 39:02.850
Go.

39:13.600 --> 39:15.841
See, it wasn't that I was weak.

39:16.040 --> 39:18.042
I was stronger than you.

39:18.200 --> 39:20.248
I pulled away.

39:21.120 --> 39:25.330
Nothing you could've done would've
saved me, because I didn't wanna be saved.

39:25.640 --> 39:29.850
- What the hell are you talking about?
- It's where I belonged.

39:30.520 --> 39:32.249
I needed to do penance.

39:32.920 --> 39:36.402
After the things I did on Earth and in
heaven, I didn't deserve to be out.

39:36.640 --> 39:38.881
And I saw that clearly when I was there.

39:40.080 --> 39:41.570
L...

39:41.880 --> 39:45.248
I planned to stay all along.
I just didn't know how to tell you.

39:48.200 --> 39:51.283
You can't save everyone, my friend.

39:51.920 --> 39:53.410
Though you "Y

39:55.120 --> 39:56.451
Hey.

39:57.200 --> 39:58.850
Everything okay?

39:59.040 --> 40:00.280
Yeah.

40:00.440 --> 40:02.283
Just, uh...

40:02.960 --> 40:04.769
...setting a few things straight.

40:04.960 --> 40:07.611
Good.
Garth is gonna lay low with the Tra...

40:09.920 --> 40:12.127
Hello, Castiel.

40:14.200 --> 40:16.043
Where am I?

40:16.200 --> 40:17.611
You don't know?

40:19.680 --> 40:21.648
You're home, Castiel.

40:22.360 --> 40:23.930
Heaven?

40:24.080 --> 40:25.889
I've never been here before.

40:26.040 --> 40:27.769
Not many have.

40:27.920 --> 40:32.130
My name is Naomi. We rescued you.

40:33.680 --> 40:35.330
Purgatory.

40:35.480 --> 40:39.246
An incursion of angels
which cost us many lives.

40:39.400 --> 40:42.643
Consider these chats your repayment.

40:44.000 --> 40:46.002
I don't understand.

40:46.560 --> 40:48.847
Tell me about Sam and Dean.

40:49.800 --> 40:52.849
The prophet is being kept safe.
The tablet has split in two...

40:53.000 --> 40:56.447
...and the Winchesters are trying
to recover the missing piece.

40:57.400 --> 40:59.164
Why am I telling you any of this?

40:59.320 --> 41:04.008
It's not your concern.
Help the Winchesters, come when they call.

41:04.160 --> 41:05.969
You will report in to me regularly...

41:06.120 --> 41:09.090
...and you will never remember
having done so.

41:09.960 --> 41:11.530
No.

41:11.960 --> 41:14.008
I won't do that.

41:15.840 --> 41:18.525
Now, as you were.

41:18.680 --> 41:20.489
They won't even notice you were gone.

41:20.640 --> 41:22.802
...Track down the other piece.

41:23.000 --> 41:25.367
You're with us on this one, right, Cass?

41:27.440 --> 41:29.363
Cass, you okay?

41:30.000 --> 41:31.490
I'm fine.

41:31.640 --> 41:34.883
And yes, I'm with you. If that's all right.

41:43.800 --> 41:45.689
It is, right?

41:45.840 --> 41:47.524
You two are good?

41:49.200 --> 41:50.884
Yeah.
