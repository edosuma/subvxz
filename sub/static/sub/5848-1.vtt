00:29.130 --> 00:33.667
(Dramatic, fast-paced music)

00:38.139 --> 00:38.772
(Door slams)

00:47.081 --> 00:49.350
(Breathes heavily)

00:52.820 --> 00:55.156
(Footsteps approach)

01:00.628 --> 01:01.762
What's wrong with you, girl?

01:03.164 --> 01:04.498
I just came to say goodnight.

01:05.166 --> 01:06.834
No, you didn't.

01:08.436 --> 01:09.337
Well.

01:10.304 --> 01:11.339
Well, well, well.

01:12.540 --> 01:13.374
You know.

01:16.210 --> 01:17.077
Don't you?

01:19.580 --> 01:20.548
You know.

01:21.215 --> 01:23.351
Your fucking bitch of mother,

01:23.851 --> 01:25.386
Must've passed out drunk.

01:26.320 --> 01:28.822
Every time I come over.

01:29.857 --> 01:30.758
Well...

01:31.859 --> 01:33.594
It's gotta go somewhere.

01:35.196 --> 01:36.430
It's man's nature.

01:37.565 --> 01:41.435
Man cannot change

01:42.203 --> 01:43.204
His nature.

01:43.637 --> 01:45.173
[Vine] You sure about that?

01:47.208 --> 01:48.509
Fuck off.

01:48.509 --> 01:50.144
Ain't no junkies that
deal through here.

01:55.483 --> 01:56.784
What you want, Vine?

01:58.619 --> 01:59.820
Status quo.

02:01.189 --> 02:02.823
No dead little girls
in the basement,

02:02.823 --> 02:05.393
No building crawling with cops.

02:07.628 --> 02:09.797
Dead girl, what the
fuck you talking about?

02:10.198 --> 02:11.365
Well I figure
when she stabs you

02:11.365 --> 02:12.900
With that large nail
she has in her hand,

02:12.900 --> 02:14.802
You'll do one of two things:

02:15.936 --> 02:17.838
You'll either beat her so
bad she needs an ambulance,

02:17.838 --> 02:19.273
Or kill her.

02:19.573 --> 02:21.809
Either way it's just not
good for business, so...

02:22.176 --> 02:23.377
You know.

02:23.777 --> 02:25.479
You'll have to kill
her somewhere else.

02:39.727 --> 02:41.429
You tripping, man.

02:42.263 --> 02:43.431
Girl ran off.

02:43.664 --> 02:46.300
I just came to get her.
That's it.

03:01.882 --> 03:03.183
Andre.

03:04.252 --> 03:06.920
Patron Saint of lost children.

03:17.298 --> 03:21.735
(Quiet dramatic music
building in volume)

(Sirens wail in distance)

03:35.616 --> 03:39.487
(Gunshots)
(woman screams)

03:47.695 --> 03:50.764
(Alarm wails)

03:50.764 --> 03:53.901
[Cornelia] There
are signs everywhere.

03:54.602 --> 03:58.772
A floating leaf,
a sound, a shadow.

04:00.007 --> 04:04.011
It's not the sign, but the
meaning that concerns us.

04:06.013 --> 04:07.014
[Wayne] Hold up, ho.

04:07.481 --> 04:08.716
Talk to Big Wayne.

04:13.687 --> 04:18.726
Do you understand these
are signs of deception?

04:19.860 --> 04:20.861
[Maria] He's lying to me?

04:20.861 --> 04:23.531
[Cornelia] No, dear,
he's cheating on you.

04:23.997 --> 04:24.898
(Maria sighs)

04:24.898 --> 04:26.567
Infidelity is also a sign

04:26.567 --> 04:28.936
We must seek further meaning.

04:30.604 --> 04:31.605
He don't love me.

04:31.605 --> 04:33.006
That's the meaning.

04:33.374 --> 04:35.008
That's why he go
with that whore!

04:35.643 --> 04:38.746
(Speaks foreign language)
(sobs)

04:44.051 --> 04:48.389
(Spooky, spiritual whooshing)

04:52.893 --> 04:54.061
Madam Cornelia?

04:58.766 --> 05:00.300
What should I do?

05:01.969 --> 05:04.738
Well, let's see what
the cards tell us, next.

05:06.607 --> 05:10.611
(Glass cracks)
(dramatic music)

05:12.112 --> 05:15.583
These old cards,
they rip so easily.

05:15.583 --> 05:16.650
Cristo.

05:17.351 --> 05:18.419
[Cornelia] What did you say?

05:19.086 --> 05:20.454
Esta negro.

05:20.854 --> 05:22.690
It changed to black glass.

05:23.891 --> 05:25.459
And you can see that?

05:27.561 --> 05:29.597
[Maria] I don't
understand, Madam Cornelia.

05:31.999 --> 05:34.635
You will, Maria, briefly.

05:36.437 --> 05:37.871
I'm sorry.

05:39.039 --> 05:41.008
(Dramatic music)

05:42.443 --> 05:47.114
(Maria gasps for breath)

05:58.826 --> 06:00.461
(Knocks on door)

06:04.432 --> 06:05.365
Dooley.

06:16.009 --> 06:19.079
(Cell phone key pad clicks)

06:54.181 --> 06:57.050
(Demonic whispers)

06:57.050 --> 06:58.418
[Voiceover] The obsidian sun.

06:58.652 --> 07:00.087
The new Interpreter arrives.

07:00.721 --> 07:01.922
[Voiceover] Who is that?

07:01.922 --> 07:03.156
[Voiceover] She
is not in the UK,

07:03.156 --> 07:04.992
If in fact she is a she.

07:05.459 --> 07:06.760
Right, who's got it?

07:06.760 --> 07:08.629
[Cornelila] Here. It is here.

07:09.463 --> 07:10.931
But the card is not blue.

07:11.098 --> 07:12.065
[Voiceover] Not blue...

07:12.065 --> 07:13.567
What do you mean, it's not blue?

07:13.901 --> 07:15.135
It's always blue.

07:15.135 --> 07:16.837
The most incomparable blue.

07:17.070 --> 07:18.606
The most azure blue.

07:19.206 --> 07:20.908
[Cornelia] It's not blue.

07:21.542 --> 07:25.178
(Disembodied voices
speaks foreign languages)

07:25.178 --> 07:26.680
[Voiceover] What is happening?

07:26.814 --> 07:28.081
- [Voiceover] You can see...
- [Voiceover] I see.

07:28.081 --> 07:29.750
[Voiceover] Why
was this not foreseen?

07:29.750 --> 07:30.684
What is the meaning?

07:30.684 --> 07:31.819
[Cornelia] Relinquere.

07:31.819 --> 07:34.922
(Voices fade)

07:39.126 --> 07:40.093
What comes?

07:41.695 --> 07:45.499
(Footsteps approach)

07:49.737 --> 07:50.871
Interpreter.

08:02.149 --> 08:05.218
Ah, now you're sure
she saw the card

08:05.218 --> 08:07.721
Before you pierced her?

08:08.889 --> 08:12.159
It's a small thing to kill
somebody over, you know?

08:13.927 --> 08:15.495
None of us happens, Adam.

08:16.129 --> 08:17.531
Ever.

08:17.731 --> 08:19.199
Obsidian is a sign
that a new Interpreter

08:19.199 --> 08:20.568
Has come to the world.

08:21.134 --> 08:22.770
But it is always blue.

08:23.270 --> 08:24.805
Humans do not see into our world

08:24.805 --> 08:26.239
Without being touched.

08:26.239 --> 08:28.175
Yeah, well...

08:30.711 --> 08:31.845
You touched her.

08:33.981 --> 08:35.549
I can help you with the body.

08:36.650 --> 08:38.686
Not really sure
what else I can do.

08:39.852 --> 08:41.188
Keep your eyes open.

08:42.054 --> 08:43.890
Something has come
into our plane.

08:44.191 --> 08:46.526
If it is not Fortune
seeking a new Interpreter,

08:46.760 --> 08:48.228
It may be something else.

08:50.964 --> 08:52.800
Look for anything unusual.

08:56.069 --> 08:57.104
(Vine sighs)

08:57.104 --> 08:58.872
"Unusual."

08:59.773 --> 09:00.608
[Lisa] Come on!

09:00.608 --> 09:01.575
[Frank] Lisa...

09:21.862 --> 09:23.196
Hit me again, Frank.

09:23.196 --> 09:24.197
I'm telling you,

09:25.298 --> 09:27.735
Fucking put it down.

09:29.770 --> 09:30.804
(Pan thwacks)
(Frank grunts)

09:30.804 --> 09:32.005
(Body falls)

09:40.213 --> 09:41.281
[Voiceover] Good
evening, America.

09:41.281 --> 09:42.883
Welcome to the show.

09:42.883 --> 09:47.254
(Voice drowned out
by tense music)

09:58.966 --> 10:01.001
(Audience laughs on television)

10:02.670 --> 10:07.607
(Audience applauds
on television)

10:09.910 --> 10:13.113
(Water drips)

10:24.157 --> 10:25.025
Vine.

10:26.126 --> 10:27.327
What the fuck you doing?

10:28.962 --> 10:30.163
Eavesdropping.

10:31.899 --> 10:33.100
You got my money?

10:35.002 --> 10:36.937
Tripp and Helo just
went to the bank.

10:37.270 --> 10:39.006
Yeah, you don't have a bank.

10:39.006 --> 10:40.107
Sure we do.

10:40.407 --> 10:41.875
Snatch and Grab Trust.

10:41.875 --> 10:43.711
(Laughs)
See?

10:43.711 --> 10:44.411
Here they come.

10:44.411 --> 10:45.913
Have a little faith, Vine.

10:47.748 --> 10:48.348
[Tripp] Hi, Vine.

10:48.348 --> 10:49.282
Tripp.

10:51.752 --> 10:52.920
Madam.

10:55.155 --> 10:57.758
Fuck you, you
fucking procurer.

10:57.758 --> 10:59.292
Do your job and bring
us something to eat.

10:59.292 --> 11:00.127
Helo!

11:00.127 --> 11:01.094
I speak for us.

11:01.094 --> 11:01.929
I do.

11:03.130 --> 11:04.331
He's hungry.

11:05.232 --> 11:06.767
Yeah, well they
were beating the shit

11:06.767 --> 11:08.769
Out of each other next
door a minute ago.

11:08.769 --> 11:10.704
Have 'em take a
snort of that, huh?

11:11.204 --> 11:12.439
You know how it is, Vine.

11:12.439 --> 11:14.975
Same thing day in, day
out, it gets tedious.

11:17.277 --> 11:20.013
But that's why we like
your product so much.

11:20.480 --> 11:22.449
Variety is the spice of life.

11:23.851 --> 11:25.218
So they say.

11:25.919 --> 11:28.355
Pay me tomorrow, no later.

11:36.263 --> 11:39.032
You let him get
away with too much.

11:40.333 --> 11:43.103
You don't tear off the
hand that feeds you, Helo.

11:44.137 --> 11:45.906
The minute he stops feeding us,

11:46.840 --> 11:48.275
I'll rip his heart out.

11:58.819 --> 11:59.787
[Man on street] Fuck you!

12:00.087 --> 12:01.088
Come here, bitch.

12:01.221 --> 12:02.322
I said come here, motherfucker!

12:02.322 --> 12:05.125
(Siren wails in distance)

12:05.125 --> 12:06.559
[Vine] "Unusual."

12:10.397 --> 12:14.935
(Dramatic music)

12:36.857 --> 12:38.058
Got any ice?

12:59.479 --> 13:00.780
(Man yells)

13:03.216 --> 13:04.784
I'll kill myself!

13:05.085 --> 13:06.519
I swear to Christ.

13:06.519 --> 13:08.956
Please!
(glass shatters)

13:16.229 --> 13:17.564
(Flesh squishes)

13:20.167 --> 13:25.038
(Dramatic music intensifies)

13:40.453 --> 13:45.125
(Music plays from
within apartment)

13:47.460 --> 13:48.428
Oh, my God.

13:49.396 --> 13:50.430
Beautiful.

13:53.333 --> 13:54.501
You're fricking beautiful.

13:54.501 --> 13:56.236
(Amber moans)
(man grunts)

14:02.075 --> 14:06.880
(Dramatic music)

14:14.387 --> 14:15.522
Oh, shit.

14:17.357 --> 14:19.026
I didn't realize
how strong this was.

14:20.660 --> 14:22.963
Hey, uh, what happened?

14:23.230 --> 14:24.397
[Amber] I'm done.

14:24.397 --> 14:25.398
We'll just call
this one a freebie.

14:26.366 --> 14:28.435
I just started my period.

14:28.936 --> 14:30.103
Oh, shit, really?

14:39.079 --> 14:44.117
(Electronic tones)

14:49.422 --> 14:50.523
(Electronic tones)

14:55.162 --> 14:56.930
(Creature screams)

15:05.272 --> 15:08.608
(Voice drones on
television in background)

15:08.608 --> 15:11.611
(Sara breathes quietly)

16:16.009 --> 16:17.444
That's unusual.

16:34.361 --> 16:35.328
[Sara] Hello?

16:38.498 --> 16:40.033
What are you doing down here?

16:40.633 --> 16:41.634
I'm running away.

16:42.602 --> 16:43.570
Ah.

16:45.105 --> 16:46.306
I hate to break it to you, kid,

16:46.306 --> 16:49.376
But the basement
ain't exactly "away."

16:50.510 --> 16:51.678
I came to get Penny.

16:52.112 --> 16:53.246
I dropped her, before.

16:54.547 --> 16:55.515
Look, kid.

16:56.816 --> 16:58.218
I wouldn't run away.

16:58.785 --> 17:00.420
There's bad things out there.

17:00.420 --> 17:02.089
There's bad things here.

17:03.290 --> 17:04.290
Oh, yeah?

17:05.657 --> 17:07.194
Should I take that personally?

17:08.494 --> 17:09.561
You deal drugs.

17:10.497 --> 17:11.698
And you scare people.

17:12.598 --> 17:13.700
You have a gun.

17:14.601 --> 17:15.568
Yeah.

17:15.568 --> 17:16.403
And you don't care about

17:16.403 --> 17:17.569
Somebody who needs help.

17:19.239 --> 17:20.707
You're worse than Andre.

17:22.142 --> 17:24.577
Hm, pretty tough, huh?

17:25.478 --> 17:26.646
No fear.

17:27.747 --> 17:30.450
(Dramatic music)
I can make you afraid.

17:36.223 --> 17:37.590
Just trying to prove a point.

17:38.458 --> 17:39.426
Relax.

17:41.461 --> 17:43.163
I saved your ass, before.

17:44.231 --> 17:45.565
You should be thanking me.

17:46.599 --> 17:48.135
You told him to kill me.

17:50.270 --> 17:53.673
Yeah, well, he didn't, did he?

17:55.275 --> 17:56.209
He will.

17:57.310 --> 17:58.611
I can't stop him.

18:00.147 --> 18:01.248
But you could.

18:02.282 --> 18:03.383
You have a gun.

18:05.785 --> 18:06.786
No thanks.

18:07.854 --> 18:08.755
Why not?

18:09.722 --> 18:11.191
Why won't you help me?

18:12.459 --> 18:14.294
Status quo, kid.

18:15.862 --> 18:17.096
What's that?

18:18.531 --> 18:19.732
Hunger.

18:20.867 --> 18:23.102
Everybody's hungry
for something.

18:24.337 --> 18:25.472
You know, they can't control it,

18:25.472 --> 18:26.639
And they can't ignore it.

18:27.207 --> 18:28.175
Sometimes you're the mouth

18:28.175 --> 18:29.542
And sometimes you're the meal.

18:31.744 --> 18:33.246
It's just the way it is.

18:38.585 --> 18:39.519
Sara!

18:42.922 --> 18:44.491
What the hell's this, huh?

18:44.757 --> 18:45.725
Nothing, lady.

18:45.725 --> 18:48.528
I was just looking for Dooley.

18:50.797 --> 18:51.798
Where do you think
you're going, huh?

18:51.798 --> 18:53.132
Where you going?

18:53.433 --> 18:54.567
This place ain't
good enough for you?

18:54.567 --> 18:55.902
Is that it, baby? Huh?

18:55.902 --> 18:57.904
You gonna go out and
find a little house,

18:57.904 --> 19:00.273
With a Mommy and Daddy,

19:00.273 --> 19:01.741
And a little puppy?

19:02.509 --> 19:03.910
Hm?
(hand slaps)

19:05.512 --> 19:07.847
Didn't happen for me, it's
not happening for you.

19:07.847 --> 19:08.781
Pick it up!

19:10.683 --> 19:11.651
Come on, let's go.

19:11.651 --> 19:13.320
[Sara] Let me go! I hate you!

19:13.320 --> 19:14.587
I hate you!

19:15.622 --> 19:16.456
Kids, right?

19:17.224 --> 19:18.525
They're the worst.

19:19.192 --> 19:20.260
Go!

19:24.364 --> 19:26.433
God damn humans.

19:30.937 --> 19:32.339
(Door bangs)

19:40.347 --> 19:41.348
Dooley.

19:56.596 --> 19:58.598
(Wings flap)

19:58.598 --> 20:02.735
(Suspenseful music)

20:02.735 --> 20:03.836
(Door bangs)

20:25.458 --> 20:26.359
(Sara screams)

20:28.895 --> 20:32.765
(Doorknob rattles)

20:35.435 --> 20:38.271
(Sara cries)

20:44.544 --> 20:46.245
No use fighting this, girl.

20:54.587 --> 20:58.791
(Fast-paced, dramatic music)

21:13.406 --> 21:17.677
(Vine grunts and
breathes heavily)

21:49.742 --> 21:51.578
(Sara laughs)

21:54.614 --> 21:56.683
You got your books,
got your homework.

21:57.417 --> 21:58.451
You got your lunch money.

21:58.651 --> 22:00.387
Good. Good girl.

22:00.687 --> 22:01.721
So what other things you got?

22:02.389 --> 22:03.523
Only things you really need.

22:04.924 --> 22:07.627
What's in here,
and what's in here.

22:08.127 --> 22:09.462
Now give me some.

22:11.898 --> 22:12.999
(Both laugh)

22:12.999 --> 22:14.401
See you when you get home.

22:17.904 --> 22:19.572
(Wayne laughs)
Hey.

22:19.572 --> 22:20.873
Hey, Andre.

22:21.508 --> 22:22.609
Looking sharp.

22:22.609 --> 22:23.843
[Andre] Oh, Wayne,
good to see you.

22:23.843 --> 22:24.977
Looking for work today,

22:24.977 --> 22:26.446
Thought I'd dress up a little.

22:26.846 --> 22:28.014
Good luck, man.

22:28.147 --> 22:29.449
I'll let you know if
I hear of anything.

22:29.449 --> 22:30.617
Hey, thank you, man.

22:32.852 --> 22:33.886
Much appreciate it.

22:35.922 --> 22:37.023
Good morning, Mister Vine.

22:38.458 --> 22:39.459
Sorry about last night,

22:39.459 --> 22:41.494
I was uh, sick.

22:42.729 --> 22:43.730
But I'm better now.

22:44.431 --> 22:46.399
Hopefully you can forgive me.

22:49.402 --> 22:50.403
Um...

22:52.138 --> 22:53.039
Sure.

22:53.973 --> 22:54.807
Thank you.

22:55.174 --> 22:56.476
I gotta get going.

22:57.977 --> 22:59.111
Have a good day, Mister Vine.

23:14.561 --> 23:15.394
Goodbye.

23:16.062 --> 23:17.664
(Lisa yells)

23:20.900 --> 23:25.672
(Lisa murmurs and laughs)

23:28.441 --> 23:29.141
Sorry.

23:30.743 --> 23:31.644
Oh, shit, dude!

23:31.644 --> 23:33.780
(Laughs)
I'm sorry.

23:38.050 --> 23:39.752
You don't smell sorry.

23:42.021 --> 23:44.023
Yeah, um...

23:44.791 --> 23:46.025
Okay.
(both laugh)

23:46.493 --> 23:47.560
I'm Frank.

23:48.194 --> 23:49.128
Vine.

23:49.796 --> 23:50.630
Vine.

23:51.097 --> 23:52.198
Cool name, dude.

23:52.932 --> 23:54.534
This is Lisa.
[Lisa] Hey.

23:54.867 --> 23:56.569
[Lisa] You live in 37, right?

23:57.036 --> 23:58.004
What happened?

23:58.538 --> 23:59.539
Oh, uh...

24:00.640 --> 24:02.108
I hit myself with a bottle.

24:02.108 --> 24:03.109
I...

24:03.810 --> 24:05.978
I was massively inebriated and,

24:07.079 --> 24:09.482
I think I just wanted
her to open the door.

24:09.782 --> 24:11.450
I locked myself
in the bedroom.

24:12.184 --> 24:13.820
I was messed up.

24:14.487 --> 24:15.454
Like...

24:17.089 --> 24:19.859
Bad, but it wasn't the booze.

24:21.894 --> 24:23.663
I wasn't well.

24:24.497 --> 24:25.732
But you're better, now.

24:25.732 --> 24:26.799
Yes.

24:26.799 --> 24:28.601
(Lisa laughs)
Yes I am.

24:28.601 --> 24:29.869
We both are.

24:29.969 --> 24:33.940
You just woke up and
everything was better?

24:34.707 --> 24:36.008
I can't explain it, I...

24:36.776 --> 24:38.745
I just feel totally different.

24:40.212 --> 24:42.148
You know, not physically...

24:42.915 --> 24:45.952
I mean, my head hurts
like a motherfucker.

24:45.952 --> 24:46.919
But...

24:48.721 --> 24:50.489
This is gonna sound kinda dumb,

24:50.990 --> 24:52.992
But psychologically.

24:54.827 --> 24:56.028
Spiritually.

24:59.632 --> 25:02.234
I just feel really, really good.

25:07.607 --> 25:10.777
You feel it too,
don't you, Vine?

25:13.746 --> 25:15.081
Well, we'd better go.

25:15.682 --> 25:16.849
We're visiting my mom.

25:17.149 --> 25:19.185
It's been like, a year.

25:21.754 --> 25:22.655
Take care, bro.

25:23.022 --> 25:23.956
Bye.

25:26.125 --> 25:30.963
(Steady, mysterious music)

25:32.264 --> 25:34.066
(Door creaks open)

25:36.803 --> 25:38.671
What the hell's
going on, Vine?

25:41.841 --> 25:43.209
It's the entire building.

25:43.743 --> 25:44.777
Every floor.

25:45.077 --> 25:46.813
The humans have changed.

25:57.657 --> 25:59.892
Something has
come into our plane.

26:00.660 --> 26:01.694
[Helo] From where?

26:02.028 --> 26:02.862
Helo!

26:04.764 --> 26:05.998
Sorry, Interpreter.

26:06.265 --> 26:07.834
He doesn't know
his place, lately.

26:08.334 --> 26:09.568
What do you see?

26:10.937 --> 26:12.238
Disease has come,

26:13.172 --> 26:14.707
From another plane.

26:14.974 --> 26:17.710
Another world,
infecting the humans.

26:19.011 --> 26:20.146
Well, what do we do?

26:21.781 --> 26:23.349
You must stay in your rooms,

26:24.016 --> 26:25.918
While the Interpretee
look for a cure.

26:26.252 --> 26:28.254
No one leaves.

26:32.224 --> 26:34.627
So, you wanna tell me what's

26:34.627 --> 26:36.095
Really going on, Cornelia?

26:36.095 --> 26:39.265
Because this ain't a disease

26:39.932 --> 26:41.267
I've ever heard of.

26:42.869 --> 26:44.737
This is a powerful
method of Divination.

26:44.737 --> 26:45.938
Yeah.

26:45.938 --> 26:48.274
I'm uh, I'm familiar
with oracle bones.

26:48.708 --> 26:50.877
I've never seen one
with a human bone.

26:51.878 --> 26:53.279
Is that the real
reason you killed her?

26:55.247 --> 26:57.183
The sign is a circle
that doesn't close.

26:57.917 --> 26:59.218
See?

26:59.218 --> 27:02.388
And here, converging
lines that do not meet.

27:04.023 --> 27:05.725
Shapes that are almost shapes,

27:05.725 --> 27:07.860
Symbols that are almost symbols.

27:08.928 --> 27:10.629
Disease has come across.

27:11.263 --> 27:12.164
Yeah.

27:14.133 --> 27:15.735
Well show me a disease

27:15.735 --> 27:17.770
That can rip a man in half.

27:41.861 --> 27:44.063
(Wings flap)

27:50.937 --> 27:52.905
I'm talking about the humans.

27:53.205 --> 27:54.874
Not a bunch of fucking drales!

27:54.874 --> 27:56.943
Are you feeding,
is what I'm asking?

27:59.779 --> 28:01.180
(Sighs)

28:02.481 --> 28:04.483
[Television announcer] A
small town is in shock, today.

28:04.483 --> 28:06.919
The deaths of two
newborn babies...

28:06.919 --> 28:08.254
[Mace] He's feeding.

28:08.254 --> 28:09.789
[Television announcer]
At Saint Joseph's Hospital,

28:09.789 --> 28:10.723
Have been ruled homicides,
[Mace] The bastard.

28:10.723 --> 28:12.058
[Television announcer]
by investigators.

28:12.058 --> 28:13.492
The families have
asked for privacy

28:13.492 --> 28:16.128
As they mourn the
loss of the infants.

28:19.331 --> 28:21.834
There's plenty of
misery out there.

28:24.937 --> 28:27.139
Let's go get some.

28:27.874 --> 28:29.108
Feed in the wild?

28:29.475 --> 28:30.843
It's too dangerous.

28:31.243 --> 28:32.478
You never know whose
territory you're in,

28:32.478 --> 28:35.214
And when you find
out, it's too late.

28:44.190 --> 28:46.258
I won't let you
starve, brother.

28:47.359 --> 28:50.229
I found blood at the
bottom of the stairs,

28:50.429 --> 28:52.364
But it wasn't Dooley's.

28:53.099 --> 28:55.267
It was weird.

28:56.368 --> 28:59.105
Not quite human, but
not demon, either.

29:00.172 --> 29:01.974
I'm thinking maybe he
got one good shot in

29:01.974 --> 29:03.342
Before he was killed.

29:04.210 --> 29:08.280
If you were asking for
something unusual, that's it.

29:09.315 --> 29:10.249
Show me.

29:13.052 --> 29:14.086
[Vine] It's gone, now.

29:15.287 --> 29:16.222
Gone?

29:18.490 --> 29:19.892
Yeah, well.

29:20.993 --> 29:22.228
I kinda got knocked out,

29:22.829 --> 29:24.030
And when I came to...

29:25.531 --> 29:29.301
Wait a minute, there's
something in there.

29:37.576 --> 29:39.245
Does this have any meaning?

29:40.947 --> 29:42.414
Everything has meaning.

29:43.315 --> 29:45.417
Not everything means
something that matters.

29:47.219 --> 29:49.155
You're more than welcome
to chase bird feathers

29:49.155 --> 29:50.823
And disappearing blood, Adam,

29:51.423 --> 29:52.892
But I've got work to do.

29:53.559 --> 29:55.061
What are you gonna do?

29:55.494 --> 29:57.396
Find a cure for the humans.

29:58.030 --> 29:58.898
(Laughs softly)

30:00.967 --> 30:01.934
That's funny.

30:03.102 --> 30:04.470
Because every human I talked to

30:04.470 --> 30:06.338
Said they already found one.

30:08.908 --> 30:13.479
(Low, mysterious music)

30:39.471 --> 30:44.076
(Liquid boils)

31:31.523 --> 31:32.558
Luck.

31:32.992 --> 31:34.893
More luck.

31:39.031 --> 31:40.366
(Knocking at door)

31:50.676 --> 31:51.610
Hey, Ford.

31:52.611 --> 31:53.912
What is it, Vine?

31:54.213 --> 31:55.581
Did the humans change back?

31:55.948 --> 31:57.549
No, no, I don't think so.

32:03.122 --> 32:04.456
I have a question.

32:06.292 --> 32:09.328
You know a thing or two
about demon science, right?

32:09.695 --> 32:11.530
[Ford] You know I do.

32:12.965 --> 32:14.333
Is it true?

32:14.333 --> 32:16.535
Can you conjure a demon
if you know its true name?

32:17.436 --> 32:19.305
[Ford] You'll need
what signifies the demon,

32:19.305 --> 32:20.706
Not just the name.

32:21.407 --> 32:23.009
Unlikely to find one,

32:23.009 --> 32:25.111
Nearly impossible to find both.

32:25.444 --> 32:26.278
Why?

32:26.645 --> 32:27.546
It's a demon.

32:28.380 --> 32:29.615
A powerful one.

32:30.416 --> 32:33.485
He's influencing
the humans, Ford.

32:48.567 --> 32:49.968
Oh, my God.

32:51.470 --> 32:52.604
[Ford] Told you
all you need to know,

32:52.604 --> 32:54.206
Now get the hell outta here,

32:54.373 --> 32:57.109
Before you bring me more bad
luck than you already have.

32:57.609 --> 33:02.081
(Footsteps approach)

33:02.081 --> 33:03.049
I'm building a bookcase,

33:03.049 --> 33:07.519
Just getting a little
construction advice.

33:08.554 --> 33:10.122
The Interpretee
need your help.

33:11.123 --> 33:12.524
You need to leave the building.

33:15.494 --> 33:16.762
[Vine] Why not
get Ford or Amber?

33:16.762 --> 33:18.530
They're hungrier than I am.

33:19.198 --> 33:20.166
We're worried
about what happens

33:20.166 --> 33:21.400
If you don't find anything.

33:21.700 --> 33:23.135
Not if you do.

33:24.070 --> 33:25.704
Your lack of hunger
and your lack of fear

33:26.238 --> 33:28.006
Make you the obvious choice.

33:29.141 --> 33:31.077
You're the strongest
of us, Adam.

33:32.544 --> 33:33.745
Just go around the block.

33:34.380 --> 33:35.281
Shouldn't take long.

33:37.083 --> 33:38.417
I'll make a debt.

33:39.585 --> 33:41.687
I've had enough of those
outstanding, already.

33:42.521 --> 33:44.623
Cost you more to keep track
of then they're worth.

34:03.542 --> 34:08.447
(Traffic whooshes)

34:14.553 --> 34:16.688
[Voiceover] Hey Vine.
(fist thunks)

34:17.422 --> 34:21.226
(Electronic music)

34:21.226 --> 34:25.563
(Electronic music with a beat)

34:38.377 --> 34:39.645
Is this gonna hurt much?

34:40.246 --> 34:41.647
Man, you gotta watch this.

34:42.181 --> 34:43.315
With any luck.

34:43.315 --> 34:44.683
I hear people
freak the fuck out.

34:44.683 --> 34:46.152
Sheer terror.

34:51.290 --> 34:53.225
Next time just ask
me to get in the car.

34:53.225 --> 34:54.426
I'll say yes.

35:00.599 --> 35:02.168
My apologies, Mister Vine,

35:02.168 --> 35:04.803
But my instructions from
Mister Granville were...

35:05.437 --> 35:06.705
Explicit.

35:06.705 --> 35:09.141
Yeah, and what exactly
were your instructions?

35:09.141 --> 35:11.810
Well he told me to
make you hit the canvas,

35:11.810 --> 35:15.681
Which means, "to render
unconscious, or knock out"

35:15.681 --> 35:16.648
In the parlance.

35:16.648 --> 35:18.150
Yeah, I got it.

35:18.584 --> 35:19.451
This way.

35:24.656 --> 35:26.525
(Demon growls)

35:26.525 --> 35:27.859
Ghoul, huh?

35:33.899 --> 35:36.402
Moving up in the world, Tarqus.

35:36.402 --> 35:38.604
Success has its perks.

35:38.904 --> 35:40.239
Yeah, so...

35:41.340 --> 35:42.374
To what do I owe the honor

35:42.374 --> 35:44.610
Of getting my head knocked in?

35:44.610 --> 35:45.744
We've been getting calls

35:45.744 --> 35:48.480
About the situation
in your building.

35:49.715 --> 35:52.150
There's no situation
in my building.

35:52.451 --> 35:54.186
You've been misinformed.

35:54.320 --> 35:58.257
People without
shame, fear, or misery.

35:58.524 --> 36:00.392
We need to know if this is true.

36:00.392 --> 36:01.393
"We"?

36:02.428 --> 36:03.795
Now what would the Clades care

36:03.795 --> 36:05.364
About a run-down tenement

36:05.364 --> 36:08.700
Full of alcoholics
and wife-beaters?

36:09.701 --> 36:11.903
The Clades are a
trade organization.

36:12.938 --> 36:14.906
The Clades are
our way of life.

36:14.906 --> 36:16.708
Every demon benefits from

36:16.708 --> 36:18.910
Representation in
the market place.

36:18.910 --> 36:22.414
Even a freelance misery
peddler like yourself.

36:23.249 --> 36:25.251
Ah.
(laughs)

36:26.252 --> 36:27.719
But not the Interpretee.

36:29.421 --> 36:32.591
I mean, an Interpreter pretty
much renounces his kind,

36:32.591 --> 36:34.426
When he assumes the role.

36:34.693 --> 36:36.862
Offid, Rilk, Vorling,

36:37.496 --> 36:38.930
Even a Moloch like you.

36:40.366 --> 36:41.567
The Interpretee
have no allegiance

36:41.567 --> 36:43.635
To anyone but themselves.

36:44.403 --> 36:46.805
And that's a problem, isn't it?

36:48.974 --> 36:52.444
Are you asking if what happened
in my building is true?

36:53.279 --> 36:57.249
Or if some plan you put
in motion actually worked?

36:57.549 --> 36:58.484
So...

36:59.618 --> 37:01.953
Something is happening.

37:03.255 --> 37:04.456
What is this, Vine?

37:04.456 --> 37:05.624
A new drug?

37:05.957 --> 37:07.493
Doesn't look like it.

37:08.394 --> 37:10.796
We have to have
a long, long talk

37:10.796 --> 37:14.366
About all the things
you're not telling me.

37:14.366 --> 37:16.602
(Raucous laughter)

37:16.602 --> 37:20.005
(Dramatic music)

37:22.374 --> 37:24.576
Stop it! Stop it!

37:24.576 --> 37:26.445
They'll shut u s down.

37:26.945 --> 37:28.914
What do the Clades
have to do with this?

37:28.914 --> 37:30.449
[Tarqus] Nothing.

37:30.449 --> 37:32.718
I know you wanna take down
the Interpretee, Tarqus.

37:32.884 --> 37:34.886
Too many demons
believe in them, now.

37:34.886 --> 37:38.890
Yes, but does this look
like a master plan, to you?

37:39.958 --> 37:42.461
(Demons growl)
(humans yell)

37:45.364 --> 37:46.031
You...

37:46.498 --> 37:47.799
She sent you.

37:47.799 --> 37:50.769
Everything was fine
till you showed up.

37:52.504 --> 37:53.539
(Tarqus grunts)

37:56.842 --> 37:58.410
(Vine yells)

37:59.478 --> 38:02.348
(Wings flap)

38:17.429 --> 38:18.430
Hey, wait.

38:19.931 --> 38:20.899
I'm Vine.

38:22.968 --> 38:24.470
Pleased to meet you, I'm Ron.

38:25.937 --> 38:28.574
How uh, how you
doing today, Ron?

38:29.375 --> 38:30.041
Fine.

38:30.742 --> 38:32.811
Yeah? I mean, uh,

38:32.811 --> 38:35.947
How are you doing
today as opposed to...

38:36.682 --> 38:38.517
I don't know, say,
say yesterday.

38:40.085 --> 38:41.420
Um, about the same.

38:42.454 --> 38:44.556
Got here 4:30am, I uh...

38:45.424 --> 38:46.692
Came down, opened up the doors,

38:46.692 --> 38:47.993
Worked the morning rush.

38:48.627 --> 38:50.862
Cleaned the grill, prepped
for the lunch rush.

38:51.563 --> 38:52.698
Same as yesterday.

38:56.502 --> 38:57.803
Fascinating, huh?

39:00.572 --> 39:01.873
Oh...

39:02.608 --> 39:04.476
I don't feel like killing
every living thing

39:04.476 --> 39:06.445
On the face of the
earth anymore, though.

39:07.579 --> 39:08.880
Felt that way this morning,

39:09.815 --> 39:10.882
Yesterday morning.

39:11.483 --> 39:13.585
About every day before that.

39:15.086 --> 39:16.087
But not now.

39:18.657 --> 39:19.891
What came over you?

39:21.427 --> 39:22.394
I don't know.

39:23.895 --> 39:26.965
Suddenly just uh, had a thought.

39:27.899 --> 39:30.035
Maybe all these people
are just like me?

39:31.503 --> 39:33.539
They've hit a bit of trouble,

39:33.539 --> 39:36.742
Or things didn't work out the
way they'd hoped they would.

39:36.742 --> 39:39.745
They're confused, they're angry.

39:41.012 --> 39:43.915
But really they're,
they're afraid.

39:44.716 --> 39:46.051
When did this thought kick in?

39:47.586 --> 39:48.754
Just a little bit ago.

39:50.622 --> 39:52.390
'Bout the same time you came in,

39:53.091 --> 39:54.526
Come to think of it.

39:55.894 --> 39:58.430
Hey, you want a slice of pie?

39:58.830 --> 39:59.698
On the house.

39:59.698 --> 40:00.866
No, no.

40:01.533 --> 40:02.768
I'm getting you one, anyway.

40:05.003 --> 40:06.705
Nothing changed.

40:07.939 --> 40:10.542
Nothing changed
until I showed up.

40:10.542 --> 40:11.910
And not just at Tarqus',

40:11.910 --> 40:14.079
But at the diner, too, on
the other side of town.

40:14.079 --> 40:15.847
You shouldn't have gone there.

40:16.047 --> 40:18.850
There's a game, and I
don't know what it is.

40:19.184 --> 40:21.152
But somebody's moving
the pieces around,

40:21.152 --> 40:23.088
And I don't know who
the fuck they are.

40:24.089 --> 40:26.091
And all I know is I'm
one of the pieces.

40:26.792 --> 40:28.059
And I don't like it.

40:28.760 --> 40:30.596
Not one fucking bit, Cornelia.

40:30.596 --> 40:31.963
Calm down, Adam.

40:32.931 --> 40:34.633
Why not go to the diner?

40:35.701 --> 40:37.536
You told me to find
some misery, right?

40:37.536 --> 40:39.037
I could've gone anywhere.

40:40.672 --> 40:41.673
Unless you knew I
wouldn't make it

40:41.673 --> 40:43.975
Three steps outside the door.

40:46.011 --> 40:47.579
You called Tarqus.

40:48.847 --> 40:50.682
We can see nothing, now.

40:52.017 --> 40:53.519
You have no concept
of what it's like

40:53.519 --> 40:54.986
To be blind in this way.

40:54.986 --> 40:56.988
Are the Clades working
with the Interpretee?

40:56.988 --> 40:58.156
No.

40:58.156 --> 41:00.025
We needed information,
that's all.

41:00.592 --> 41:04.062
So you sent me to find
out if I would infect them!

41:04.696 --> 41:07.666
And a kiss just in case I
didn't make it back, huh?

41:07.966 --> 41:09.901
Well I am really
flattered, honey.

41:11.136 --> 41:12.938
You must really like me.

41:15.874 --> 41:17.609
I do like you, Adam.

41:19.210 --> 41:21.012
I've made that very clear.

41:22.714 --> 41:24.149
I don't give a damn.

41:25.551 --> 41:27.986
I won't be a dupe for
you or anybody else.

41:27.986 --> 41:29.120
I'm sorry.

41:29.721 --> 41:31.923
We needed to know,
and now we do.

41:32.891 --> 41:34.159
What do you know?

41:46.271 --> 41:48.574
[Cornelia] Disease has
not come to the humans.

41:49.074 --> 41:50.141
It's come to us.

41:50.141 --> 41:51.509
I know what that is.

41:51.843 --> 41:54.112
That's Darvatian,
get away from it.

41:56.214 --> 41:57.282
(Ford yells)

41:59.184 --> 42:00.752
There's a protection on it!

42:01.119 --> 42:01.887
A protection.

42:01.887 --> 42:03.021
We're trapped.

42:03.021 --> 42:05.857
(Cornelia screams
in very high pitch)

42:07.726 --> 42:08.727
Silence!

42:11.029 --> 42:12.664
We're all contagious.

42:12.831 --> 42:14.933
We will not be allowed to
leave until this is resolved,

42:14.933 --> 42:16.234
Or we are dead.

42:16.802 --> 42:18.737
She sent me to a ghoul club.

42:22.774 --> 42:24.810
After I arrived, they changed.

42:25.076 --> 42:26.645
Stopped suffering.

42:27.045 --> 42:29.214
When the demons couldn't
feed, they slaughtered them.

42:29.615 --> 42:30.649
So what?

42:30.782 --> 42:32.818
Humans are terminal from birth.

42:33.051 --> 42:34.219
What about us?

42:34.620 --> 42:36.955
So far, the plan is
we starve to death.

42:41.326 --> 42:44.095
Each of you must pay a visit
to a human in the building.

42:44.630 --> 42:48.566
Find some shred of misery,
suffering, anything.

42:49.334 --> 42:51.670
No matter how content
they may seem,

42:52.070 --> 42:53.571
They have a weakness.

42:55.974 --> 42:57.142
Find it.

42:58.944 --> 43:03.815
(Smooth jazz music
plays on radio)

43:03.815 --> 43:05.116
(Knocking at door)

43:10.689 --> 43:12.290
Hi, I'm Amber.

43:12.290 --> 43:14.693
I uh, live down the hall.

43:30.876 --> 43:32.010
Uh, my name's Ford.

43:32.678 --> 43:33.945
Of course you are.

43:33.945 --> 43:35.246
(Laughs)

43:35.246 --> 43:36.247
Come on in.

43:36.815 --> 43:38.349
I made cookies.

43:38.984 --> 43:40.018
Cookies!

43:47.759 --> 43:50.095
I fucking told
you, I told you!

43:50.762 --> 43:51.963
Calm down.

43:51.963 --> 43:54.232
"One more day, let's
wait one more day."

43:54.232 --> 43:55.867
Now look where we are!

43:58.403 --> 44:00.305
Calm. Down.

44:01.406 --> 44:03.208
We have to think
this thing through.

44:03.842 --> 44:05.944
We can't let the
hunger get to us.

44:06.244 --> 44:08.814
If that happens,
we're fucking done.

44:09.014 --> 44:10.415
You understand?

44:11.983 --> 44:14.886
Should we test the humans,
like the Interpreter said?

44:15.253 --> 44:17.188
Fuck what the
Interpreter said.

44:17.756 --> 44:20.191
That will only make us weaker.

44:20.692 --> 44:21.659
We stay.

44:23.361 --> 44:24.362
We think.

44:26.231 --> 44:27.899
We figure it out.

44:28.767 --> 44:30.736
Figure what out?

44:31.737 --> 44:33.238
How to break the protection.

44:48.019 --> 44:49.220
(Keys clank)

44:51.089 --> 44:53.691
[Ford Voiceover] You've gotta
draw a seven-legged scarab.

44:57.495 --> 44:59.230
Then you'll need mercury.

45:03.068 --> 45:06.204
Sulfur, and salt.

45:07.438 --> 45:09.841
Put them on the body of
the scarab close together,

45:10.075 --> 45:12.343
But don't let them touch.

45:14.212 --> 45:17.115
They'll be picking you off
the ceiling if that happens.

45:17.783 --> 45:19.985
Place the feather on top,

45:20.451 --> 45:23.221
So that it touches all three.

45:24.089 --> 45:27.392
Then light it on fire as you
speak the demon's true name.

45:27.392 --> 45:30.796

(flame hisses)

Peronga Ola Vakayah.

45:37.035 --> 45:38.103
(Ingredients explode)

45:42.373 --> 45:43.441
Shit.

45:45.911 --> 45:47.212
(Smooth jazz plays on radio)

45:47.212 --> 45:48.880
I used to hate this place,

45:48.880 --> 45:52.150
But all it needs is really
just a little sprucing up.

45:52.383 --> 45:53.518
Sprucing up?

45:53.885 --> 45:55.753
You gave this place
a full makeover.

45:56.922 --> 45:58.523
She has real talent.

45:58.990 --> 46:00.525
She's signing up for
school in the fall.

46:12.237 --> 46:14.039
So, what do you do, Amber?

46:31.289 --> 46:36.127
("Like You" by Andrew
Kapner and Landon Newsom)

46:43.835 --> 46:45.536
(Female singer vocalizes)

46:56.848 --> 46:58.149
* Frustration

46:58.149 --> 47:00.318
* I'm in a place of no escape

47:00.318 --> 47:02.520
* Dive in your
hate, can't liberate

47:02.520 --> 47:04.622
* Don't wanna live,
going on this way

47:04.622 --> 47:07.258
* I don't wanna be
just another fake

47:08.994 --> 47:10.328

47:11.329 --> 47:13.464
* Can't stand the
ways you manipulate

it'll dissipate

48:12.623 --> 48:13.424
(Amber sighs)

48:14.125 --> 48:15.994
* Aggression

48:15.994 --> 48:17.062
* Excuses

(Vocalist continues
singing in low, even voice)

48:25.503 --> 48:26.637
(Chair bangs on floor)

48:33.011 --> 48:34.980
Ugh, what's wrong
with you people?

48:36.948 --> 48:39.050
You don't need to
show us any more, Amber.

48:39.650 --> 48:41.186
I think we understand.

48:42.020 --> 48:43.088
Don't we, Frank?

48:43.688 --> 48:45.256
Sure, it's like,

48:46.057 --> 48:48.994
Prostitution or performance
art, or something.

48:56.501 --> 48:58.436
I'll make my own damn luck.

49:21.159 --> 49:22.093
Finally!

49:27.198 --> 49:28.399
What do you want?

49:35.106 --> 49:38.509
I said, what the
hell do you want?

49:42.113 --> 49:44.382
This is my luck, clear out!

Don't let it, you'll
get used to it.

50:14.412 --> 50:16.481
After a while it feels normal.

50:41.272 --> 50:43.608
(Amber hisses)

50:44.142 --> 50:46.111
(Vine growls)

50:51.116 --> 50:52.717
Make love to me, Vine.

50:56.387 --> 50:57.622
Okay.

50:58.523 --> 51:03.461
(Fast-paced, dramatic music)
(demon growling)

51:17.775 --> 51:19.444
Do you trust the Interpreter?

51:22.280 --> 51:23.481
Not entirely.

51:25.416 --> 51:27.485
But I don't trust
anyone, entirely.

51:31.722 --> 51:33.191
You know...

51:34.359 --> 51:36.827
I knew an Interpreter
once, a long time ago.

51:38.729 --> 51:40.265
They can't be killed.

51:40.898 --> 51:43.768
Everything on this earth
can be killed, Amber.

51:44.469 --> 51:46.437
No, they have to
kill themselves.

51:51.442 --> 51:53.311
Fortune belongs to them.

51:56.747 --> 52:01.186
We're all gonna starve, and
she'll find her way out.

52:02.520 --> 52:04.622
She won't even mean
to, but she will.

52:09.694 --> 52:12.129
I need you to find
me a way out, Vine.

52:17.935 --> 52:19.370
(Door rattles)

52:19.370 --> 52:21.406
- [Vine] It won't open.
- [Amber] Break it in.

52:25.710 --> 52:27.712
(Ford groans)

52:29.714 --> 52:31.148
[Vine] Get Cornelia!

52:33.584 --> 52:34.785
What happened, Ford?

52:35.453 --> 52:36.187
What happened?

52:36.187 --> 52:37.288
[Ford] Dark...

52:38.456 --> 52:40.558
So dark.

52:43.528 --> 52:44.462
What?

52:52.670 --> 52:54.171
He's starving to death.

52:54.405 --> 52:55.273
What?

52:55.806 --> 52:57.275
Why is this so soon?

52:59.944 --> 53:02.280
Just die, you stupid Vorlich!

53:07.318 --> 53:08.253
Look at me.

53:12.290 --> 53:13.291
[Ford] Thank you.

53:13.291 --> 53:14.525
Stay with me.

53:15.893 --> 53:18.263
Hey, Ford.
[Ford] I owe you.

53:18.763 --> 53:20.465
[Ford] It's a debt.

53:21.832 --> 53:23.601
(Amber hisses)

53:29.974 --> 53:31.476
What's wrong with you, Vine?

53:31.909 --> 53:33.544
You know he's never gonna pay.

53:49.327 --> 53:50.295
Come on!

53:50.595 --> 53:51.896
Act like a demon.

53:53.664 --> 53:54.799
Take what you want.

53:54.999 --> 53:56.634
You did with the Sephling.

53:57.468 --> 53:58.703
That ugly whore.

54:00.438 --> 54:02.239
I know you crave me, Adam.

54:04.575 --> 54:06.243
I can smell it on you.

54:07.011 --> 54:09.580
I smell your lust,
your violence.

54:10.047 --> 54:10.915
Do it.

54:12.417 --> 54:13.684
Why do you hesitate?

54:13.951 --> 54:14.819
Do it!

54:14.819 --> 54:16.421
Tear me limb from limb.

54:18.356 --> 54:19.757
How can I?

54:21.426 --> 54:24.995
You can't be killed,
unless you kill yourself.

54:28.466 --> 54:30.267
What of our long kisses?

54:31.902 --> 54:34.271
What are you and your
friends up to, huh?

54:34.939 --> 54:37.041
Some experiment
with the balance?

54:38.008 --> 54:39.310
You wanna know if we'll start

54:39.310 --> 54:42.012
Killing humans when
we're starving?

54:44.649 --> 54:46.016
The answer's yes.

54:47.051 --> 54:48.719
I've already seen it.

54:49.787 --> 54:50.955
[Cornelia] This is a disease.

54:51.656 --> 54:53.924
We cure ourselves, or we die.

54:54.325 --> 54:55.660
All of us!

54:55.660 --> 54:59.864
There is no cure, because
there is no disease.

55:01.031 --> 55:03.701
A demon is behind
this, Cornelia.

55:04.535 --> 55:05.870
And I'm going to prove it.

55:11.342 --> 55:13.444
Veralka Veedan Tadas.

55:14.579 --> 55:15.646
(Ingredients explode)

55:24.689 --> 55:25.856
(Glass shatters)

55:30.828 --> 55:35.800
(Low, suspenseful music)

56:14.572 --> 56:16.641
(Screams)

56:20.177 --> 56:22.513
[Voiceover] Good
evening, good to see you.

56:22.847 --> 56:23.848
How's it going?

56:29.119 --> 56:30.588
(Knocks on door)

56:36.060 --> 56:37.828
Oh, hi.

56:41.632 --> 56:43.133
We're just about, um...

56:44.469 --> 56:45.436
Come on in.

56:48.673 --> 56:49.540
You know...

56:50.508 --> 56:51.842
My father used to say,

56:52.009 --> 56:56.847
"Andre, folks'll tell
you, clothes make the man."

56:57.982 --> 56:59.116
"But don't listen to 'em."

56:59.784 --> 57:01.085
"The man makes himself."

57:02.520 --> 57:03.888
"And cloth doesn't come cheap."

57:04.522 --> 57:05.990
I just remembered
that the other day.

57:06.524 --> 57:07.625
(Jane laughs)

57:08.058 --> 57:09.960
My dad said TV
rots your brain.

57:10.495 --> 57:11.796
[Andre] My father
said that, too.

57:11.796 --> 57:13.698
(Andre and Jane laugh)

57:13.998 --> 57:15.165
I like TV.

57:15.165 --> 57:16.567
[Andre] Well, so do I.

57:17.234 --> 57:18.836
Gotta have balance, is all.

57:21.506 --> 57:23.440
Wake up!

57:25.510 --> 57:26.844
We are awake, silly.

57:28.946 --> 57:30.815
We can see you're
upset, Mister Vine.

57:31.148 --> 57:32.550
Is there anything we can do?

57:34.585 --> 57:38.589
Don't you find it the
least bit disturbing

57:39.089 --> 57:41.458
What happened in the
basement last week?

57:41.692 --> 57:43.961
Oh, I was sick.

57:44.695 --> 57:46.731
You understand, right pumpkin?

57:46.731 --> 57:47.865
Of course.

57:49.534 --> 57:51.936
And you just magically,

57:55.039 --> 57:56.874
Magically got better, hm?

57:57.642 --> 58:01.045
Oh, no, not
magic, Mister Vine.

58:02.713 --> 58:03.714
Miracle.

58:04.682 --> 58:05.816
By God, himself.

58:05.816 --> 58:06.817
God.

58:08.252 --> 58:10.154
And what did he look like?

58:11.956 --> 58:15.526
I didn't see him, but
well, who else could it be?

58:16.260 --> 58:17.628
[Jane] What are you
asking, Mister Vine?

58:19.864 --> 58:22.600
Andre was going
to forcibly rape

58:23.067 --> 58:25.002
Your 11 year old daughter, Sara.

58:25.903 --> 58:27.672
Now surely on some level,

58:28.238 --> 58:32.309
As a mother, you are
deeply and fundamentally

58:32.309 --> 58:35.179
Horrified by this, aren't you?

58:37.882 --> 58:39.617
I was a terrible mother.

58:40.751 --> 58:43.520
Neglectful, abusive.

58:43.821 --> 58:44.955
And thinking about it now,

58:44.955 --> 58:49.627
I might "feel a deep,
fundamental horror," as you say.

58:50.160 --> 58:53.898
Maybe I would feel shame,
or guilt, or sorrow.

58:56.033 --> 58:57.668
But my question to you is this,

58:59.036 --> 59:00.738
What purpose would that serve?

59:02.039 --> 59:03.641
Would it change what happened?

59:04.274 --> 59:06.243
Would it protect
Sara in the future?

59:06.811 --> 59:09.013
Would it show Andre
and I how wrong it was?

59:09.880 --> 59:14.685
Horror, fear, regret, shame...

59:15.119 --> 59:18.222
Maybe once long ago,
they were necessary.

59:19.624 --> 59:21.626
When we lived in
caves like animals.

59:23.060 --> 59:24.895
We don't need those
feelings anymore.

59:25.329 --> 59:26.664
We've evolved.

59:27.031 --> 59:28.866
We've had knowledge
and reason for

59:29.700 --> 59:32.002
Thousands of years,
it's time we used them.

59:33.871 --> 59:36.173
It's time we became truly human.

59:41.846 --> 59:43.848
I got a second job
interview tomorrow.

59:44.815 --> 59:45.716
That fellow Wayne?

59:46.116 --> 59:47.284
Put in a good word.

59:48.252 --> 59:49.854
That's great.

59:50.955 --> 59:52.022
Isn't that great?

59:54.625 --> 59:55.259
Yeah.

59:58.696 --> 59:59.664
Yeah.

01:00:00.965 --> 01:00:03.734
(Demons breathe shallowly)

01:00:25.289 --> 01:00:26.657
(Mace yells)

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:38.903
You said you would
rip his heart out

01:00:39.203 --> 01:00:41.906
The moment he
stopped feeding us!

01:00:43.207 --> 01:00:45.676
[Mace] It wasn't Vine's
fault, for Christ's sake.

01:00:46.977 --> 01:00:50.915
You said you
wouldn't let us starve!

01:00:51.281 --> 01:00:52.817
We haven't yet, have we?

01:00:53.283 --> 01:00:55.119
I don't see you with any ideas.

01:00:55.119 --> 01:00:56.320
It's been a week.

01:00:56.854 --> 01:00:59.690
The humans aren't
gonna change back.

01:01:00.024 --> 01:01:01.859
So we gotta change them back.

01:01:03.293 --> 01:01:04.261
The balance.

01:01:04.261 --> 01:01:06.663
Fuck Vine, fuck the balance!

01:01:10.801 --> 01:01:12.803
And this one I call Penny.

01:01:13.003 --> 01:01:14.204
She's Native American.

01:01:16.106 --> 01:01:17.742
(Both laugh)

01:01:21.211 --> 01:01:22.346
Where's your family?

01:01:23.981 --> 01:01:25.750
I don't have a family.

01:01:27.317 --> 01:01:28.685
Do you have friends?

01:01:30.054 --> 01:01:31.288
I have a type.

01:01:31.989 --> 01:01:33.090
I'm a Taryn.

01:01:34.358 --> 01:01:35.860
It's hard to explain.

01:01:39.063 --> 01:01:40.097
Explain it to me.

01:01:40.364 --> 01:01:41.799
I'm a pretty good listener.

01:01:41.999 --> 01:01:43.100
My teacher says so.

01:01:46.370 --> 01:01:47.237
Why not?

01:01:50.307 --> 01:01:51.708
I had a dream.

01:01:52.843 --> 01:01:56.246
We don't dream, but I had one.

01:01:57.081 --> 01:01:59.116
And I'm wondering if
it's still happening.

01:02:00.217 --> 01:02:01.786
Then it doesn't
matter, does it?

01:02:02.319 --> 01:02:04.989
Anything you do in
a dream isn't real.

01:02:24.441 --> 01:02:29.279
(Orchestral music)

01:03:14.291 --> 01:03:15.993
You're a bird man.

01:03:19.063 --> 01:03:20.530
It's not bad.

01:03:21.465 --> 01:03:23.333
I mean, it's cool.

01:03:24.234 --> 01:03:25.069
Really.

01:03:25.870 --> 01:03:26.937
Don't be sad.

01:03:29.406 --> 01:03:30.507
Can you fly?

01:03:31.175 --> 01:03:32.142
Yes.

01:03:33.510 --> 01:03:35.079
[Sara] And people see you?

01:03:37.014 --> 01:03:41.151
No, people can't unless
they've been pierced.

01:03:42.619 --> 01:03:45.355
It has something to do
with the body, somehow.

01:03:46.356 --> 01:03:49.059
Or the weight of the world
doesn't let them see us.

01:03:50.594 --> 01:03:53.163
When we fly, they see a bird,

01:03:53.163 --> 01:03:56.133
Or something else that
makes sense to them.

01:03:57.902 --> 01:04:01.605
If it doesn't make sense, they
don't see anything at all.

01:04:03.340 --> 01:04:05.042
I think I understand.

01:04:06.210 --> 01:04:08.078
Maybe it'll all work
differently one day.

01:04:08.946 --> 01:04:10.614
It'll all make
sense to everybody.

01:04:11.081 --> 01:04:12.549
And everybody will
see everybody else

01:04:12.549 --> 01:04:14.051
The way they really are.

01:04:17.221 --> 01:04:18.355
(Vine laughs very quietly)

01:04:38.175 --> 01:04:39.543
Did she come with this?

01:04:40.177 --> 01:04:41.378
No, I put it there.

01:04:42.412 --> 01:04:43.547
Where did you get it?

01:04:44.114 --> 01:04:45.082
From a bird.

01:04:46.250 --> 01:04:47.151
You saw it?

01:04:47.484 --> 01:04:48.418
In the basement.

01:04:48.986 --> 01:04:50.354
The same night I saw you.

01:04:51.021 --> 01:04:52.456
The night I was
going to run away.

01:04:53.123 --> 01:04:54.291
A little red bird.

01:04:57.527 --> 01:04:58.428
Hang on.

01:04:59.363 --> 01:05:00.630
Did it look like this?

01:05:01.131 --> 01:05:02.432
No, not exactly.

01:05:04.034 --> 01:05:05.235
How about that?

01:05:05.235 --> 01:05:07.004
Almost, but the
wings weren't black,

01:05:07.004 --> 01:05:08.105
It was all red.

01:05:10.174 --> 01:05:11.108
That's it!

01:05:12.409 --> 01:05:13.510
What does it mean?

01:05:16.113 --> 01:05:18.015
It's the status quo, kid.

01:05:18.715 --> 01:05:20.450
(Men grunting)

01:05:20.717 --> 01:05:21.618
What is it?

01:05:22.452 --> 01:05:23.587
Stay here.

01:05:24.654 --> 01:05:28.425
(Fast-paced, dramatic music)

01:05:28.425 --> 01:05:30.995
(Demons yell)
(fists punch)

01:05:33.330 --> 01:05:34.331
What's wrong?

01:05:35.465 --> 01:05:36.300
Hunger.

01:05:36.300 --> 01:05:37.601
It's made them crazy.

01:05:41.605 --> 01:05:42.706
I speak for us!

01:05:44.741 --> 01:05:46.110
Not any more.

01:05:53.283 --> 01:05:54.284
Mace!

01:05:55.585 --> 01:05:58.955
(Flesh smacks repeatedly)

01:06:04.561 --> 01:06:05.495
(Neck cracks)

01:06:12.069 --> 01:06:13.470
[Helo] He speaks for us?

01:06:14.604 --> 01:06:15.439
Does he?

01:06:16.706 --> 01:06:19.543
(Flesh rips)

01:06:27.017 --> 01:06:29.719
I speak for us.
(laughs)

01:06:30.354 --> 01:06:34.391
I speak for us.
(laughs)

01:06:34.624 --> 01:06:36.993
I speak for us!

01:06:37.294 --> 01:06:39.596
It's like this with our kind.

01:06:41.265 --> 01:06:43.100
(Yells)
(fist smacks)

01:06:47.137 --> 01:06:50.040
Okay, Perembra.

01:06:52.376 --> 01:06:53.343
Rubra.

01:07:01.351 --> 01:07:04.421
(Wings flap)

01:07:06.790 --> 01:07:10.427
(Wings flap)
(dramatic, eerie music)

01:07:22.472 --> 01:07:24.074
Show yourself!

01:07:31.448 --> 01:07:33.049
(Demon growls)

01:07:34.318 --> 01:07:35.319
Please.

01:07:37.554 --> 01:07:38.588
Please!

01:07:39.489 --> 01:07:40.724
Show yourself!

01:07:55.105 --> 01:07:58.342
(Demonic whispers)
(angelic music)

01:08:09.119 --> 01:08:09.686
Wait...

01:08:09.686 --> 01:08:13.290
(Power whines)

01:08:13.290 --> 01:08:15.659
Wait, no!

01:08:16.426 --> 01:08:17.527
Stop!

01:08:17.527 --> 01:08:18.528
(High-pitched whine
grows very loud)

01:08:18.528 --> 01:08:19.529
Stop!

01:08:21.531 --> 01:08:22.366
(Gunshot)

01:08:22.899 --> 01:08:27.270
(Breathes shakily)

01:08:53.897 --> 01:08:57.734
(Door creaks)

01:09:06.410 --> 01:09:07.611
I saw him.

01:09:09.779 --> 01:09:11.180
He was right here.

01:09:18.354 --> 01:09:20.390
It's not a disease, Cornelia.

01:09:21.524 --> 01:09:22.559
I know.

01:09:24.661 --> 01:09:26.296
This card represents you.

01:09:42.812 --> 01:09:44.948
The physician
represents disease.

01:09:45.314 --> 01:09:47.216
Illness, death.

01:09:48.452 --> 01:09:50.420
Also healing, and cure.

01:09:51.654 --> 01:09:55.359
But above all, it
represents compassion.

01:09:57.361 --> 01:09:59.896
You have done what no
demon has done before.

01:10:00.864 --> 01:10:03.199
You have changed your
fundamental nature.

01:10:04.568 --> 01:10:05.735
You care for them.

01:10:06.570 --> 01:10:08.938
You have compassion
for the humans.

01:10:09.639 --> 01:10:11.808
It is you that brought
this into our world!

01:10:11.808 --> 01:10:13.810
(Vine growls)
(Cornelia hisses)

01:10:15.412 --> 01:10:16.513
Not me.

01:10:16.746 --> 01:10:18.214
Deny that you care for them.

01:10:19.015 --> 01:10:19.783
Do it.

01:10:20.450 --> 01:10:21.751
Lie to my face!

01:10:28.458 --> 01:10:31.328
Nature abhors a vacuum, Adam.

01:10:31.828 --> 01:10:36.666
Your compassion is a bright
hole, in your black heart.

01:10:38.568 --> 01:10:40.770
And nature has
filled it with death,

01:10:41.037 --> 01:10:43.340
For you and everyone around you.

01:10:45.041 --> 01:10:46.876
You must repair your
heart, yourself.

01:10:47.611 --> 01:10:49.813
You must kill the girl.

01:11:07.297 --> 01:11:07.864
Hey...

01:11:09.333 --> 01:11:10.300
Ford.

01:11:11.768 --> 01:11:13.537
I need you to look at something.

01:11:14.704 --> 01:11:18.408
(Ford breathes heavily)

01:11:18.842 --> 01:11:21.811
[Ford] Vine, you devil-whore.

01:11:21.978 --> 01:11:24.748
I said it was a debt.

01:11:24.748 --> 01:11:25.982
It's time to pay.

01:11:27.684 --> 01:11:30.987
This was lead, when I
shot it into a demon.

01:11:31.521 --> 01:11:33.056
A demon made of darkness.

01:11:34.924 --> 01:11:35.692
Okay?

01:11:36.426 --> 01:11:37.727
What is it now?

01:11:47.871 --> 01:11:48.705
Aurum.

01:11:49.573 --> 01:11:50.774
It's gold.

01:11:52.542 --> 01:11:54.010
What kind of
demon can do that?

01:11:55.345 --> 01:11:56.846
Any kind of demon.

01:11:57.547 --> 01:12:00.316
Any kind of demon could do that.

01:12:06.690 --> 01:12:08.592
(Ford laughs)

01:12:08.892 --> 01:12:10.660
You impotent fool.

01:12:10.860 --> 01:12:13.363
You false prophet.

01:12:13.830 --> 01:12:15.732
You're gonna die, Vine.

01:12:16.132 --> 01:12:18.735
Just like me.

01:12:19.436 --> 01:12:20.537
We're immortal.

01:12:21.505 --> 01:12:24.808
We're all going to...
(coughs)

01:12:43.393 --> 01:12:45.495
I've been looking
for you everywhere.

01:12:47.464 --> 01:12:48.632
Why are you hiding?

01:12:53.570 --> 01:12:54.571
I'm not hiding.

01:12:56.673 --> 01:12:57.707
I'm thinking.

01:12:58.575 --> 01:12:59.809
There's a difference.

01:13:00.710 --> 01:13:02.646
What are you thinking about?

01:13:03.580 --> 01:13:04.881
A dream I had.

01:13:05.815 --> 01:13:07.517
But you can't dream.

01:13:08.084 --> 01:13:09.786
Only humans can dream.

01:13:10.153 --> 01:13:11.120
I did.

01:13:11.821 --> 01:13:13.990
Are you going to kill her?

01:13:15.892 --> 01:13:19.429
Are you going to kill the girl?

01:13:23.032 --> 01:13:24.000
Sure.

01:13:24.934 --> 01:13:26.736
You're lying!

01:13:28.538 --> 01:13:30.674
You're gonna choose her,

01:13:31.475 --> 01:13:33.577
Over your own kind!

01:13:34.511 --> 01:13:38.615
Is it because you think
that she's beautiful?

01:13:39.182 --> 01:13:41.618
And that we're monsters.

01:13:42.519 --> 01:13:44.821
We are monsters, Amber.

01:13:44.821 --> 01:13:49.092
(Dramatic music)

01:13:50.226 --> 01:13:53.663
(Vine grunts)
(Amber yells)

01:14:01.505 --> 01:14:02.872
(Vine growls)

01:14:08.812 --> 01:14:10.714
(Amber yells)

01:14:12.215 --> 01:14:13.817
I don't wanna kill you.

01:14:14.484 --> 01:14:15.184
Please...

01:14:17.186 --> 01:14:18.121
(Vine yells)

01:14:18.121 --> 01:14:20.156
(Cheerful music)
Oh, man!

01:14:20.590 --> 01:14:21.958
Whoo!

01:14:22.158 --> 01:14:23.226
To your new job.

01:14:23.226 --> 01:14:24.728
Oh, no, baby...

01:14:26.095 --> 01:14:27.096
To us.

01:14:29.065 --> 01:14:31.000
Oh yeah.
(laughs)

01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:32.702
Hey, everybody,
thanks for coming.

01:14:32.702 --> 01:14:35.038
(Group cheers)

01:14:35.038 --> 01:14:38.474
(Cheerful music is muffled
playing through wall)

01:14:38.842 --> 01:14:40.243
Found you a way out.

01:14:45.982 --> 01:14:48.885
("Surf's Up" by The Surfonics)

01:14:48.885 --> 01:14:50.620
(Knocks on door)

01:15:03.733 --> 01:15:05.869
(Door creaks open)

01:15:17.280 --> 01:15:18.548
(Gun clicks)

01:15:30.594 --> 01:15:31.628
Hello, Vine.

01:15:35.899 --> 01:15:38.134
Look, Penny lost
one of her eyes.

01:15:47.176 --> 01:15:48.612
You're gonna kill me, Vine.

01:15:52.649 --> 01:15:53.983
I don't want you to.

01:15:55.652 --> 01:15:57.621
But if you have
to, I understand.

01:16:00.089 --> 01:16:01.090
You do?

01:16:02.158 --> 01:16:03.226
Status quo.

01:16:04.160 --> 01:16:05.561
It's about killing.

01:16:06.630 --> 01:16:08.898
You have to kill
things to stay alive.

01:16:10.333 --> 01:16:11.868
That's what you meant, isn't it?

01:16:12.268 --> 01:16:17.106
(Dramatic music)

01:16:24.080 --> 01:16:25.314
(Shocking music)
(Cornelia cries out)

01:16:26.182 --> 01:16:28.718
[Ford] The obsidian
sign was corrupt.

01:16:29.819 --> 01:16:32.588
But Fortune found him anyway.

01:16:32.789 --> 01:16:33.790
He dreamed.

01:16:34.090 --> 01:16:36.860
Vine is the Interpreter.

01:16:36.860 --> 01:16:39.863
He will kill us all.

01:16:39.863 --> 01:16:41.631
I will have my share.

01:16:58.181 --> 01:16:59.615
You okay?

01:17:00.249 --> 01:17:01.718
All right, I want you to
stay outta the building

01:17:01.718 --> 01:17:02.986
Until you see the cops.

01:17:03.319 --> 01:17:05.655
A lot of...
(mysterious, low squeal)

01:17:11.294 --> 01:17:12.628
Come on, let's go.

01:17:39.889 --> 01:17:41.090
[Sara] Vine,
where are we going?

01:17:41.090 --> 01:17:42.926
[Vine] I'm gonna put
you some place safe.

01:17:54.403 --> 01:17:55.905
Yeah, over here.

01:18:11.921 --> 01:18:13.356
[Cornelia] The passage.

01:18:13.790 --> 01:18:14.958
(Knocks on door)

01:18:15.925 --> 01:18:17.460
(Door squeaks open)

01:18:18.027 --> 01:18:20.296
[Vine] Okay, whatever you do,

01:18:20.296 --> 01:18:21.831
No matter what you hear,

01:18:21.831 --> 01:18:23.699
You don't come out till I
come back for you, okay?

01:18:23.933 --> 01:18:24.834
[Sara] Why not?

01:18:25.268 --> 01:18:26.235
I'm not afraid.

01:18:27.771 --> 01:18:29.906
[Vine] Well I am, now come on.

01:18:32.075 --> 01:18:33.242
Wait a second.

01:18:37.781 --> 01:18:39.215
(Door squeaks open)
This isn't right.

01:18:43.987 --> 01:18:44.988
(Door slams)

01:18:46.289 --> 01:18:47.490
I can see you again.

01:18:47.490 --> 01:18:52.261
(Dramatic orchestral music)

01:19:14.951 --> 01:19:15.551
Where are we?

01:19:15.551 --> 01:19:17.086
I don't feel right.

01:19:17.253 --> 01:19:18.521
I feel...

01:19:18.521 --> 01:19:20.824
(Eerie voice whispers)
[Voiceover] Vine...

01:19:20.824 --> 01:19:22.792
- [Sara] I'm scared, Vine.
- [Vine] Shh.

01:19:22.792 --> 01:19:24.160
[Voiceover] She's mine...

01:19:25.494 --> 01:19:27.030
Kill her...

01:19:27.030 --> 01:19:28.297
[Sara] What's happening?

01:19:28.898 --> 01:19:30.800
[Voiceover] Kill the human.

01:19:32.101 --> 01:19:34.103
Kill her...

01:19:35.271 --> 01:19:36.906
Vine...

01:19:42.846 --> 01:19:43.446
[Vine] Come on.

01:19:43.446 --> 01:19:48.184
(Suspenseful music)

01:20:06.135 --> 01:20:08.104
(Shocking music)
(gunshot)

01:20:09.472 --> 01:20:11.274
There's nowhere to go, Vine.

01:20:14.944 --> 01:20:16.145
(Vine yells)

01:20:18.214 --> 01:20:20.083
[Sara] Vine! Vine!

01:20:20.316 --> 01:20:21.217
Vine!

01:20:22.886 --> 01:20:24.020
(Vine growls)

01:20:27.456 --> 01:20:30.093
(Fist smacks)

01:20:31.060 --> 01:20:32.461
(Bone crunches)

01:20:36.933 --> 01:20:37.934
[Tripp] No!

01:20:37.934 --> 01:20:39.835
(Multiple gunshots)

01:20:40.436 --> 01:20:44.107
(Vine breathes heavily)

01:20:48.144 --> 01:20:49.345
(Chains rattle)

01:20:53.482 --> 01:20:55.018
Safe here.

01:21:04.360 --> 01:21:05.261
That's enough.

01:21:06.629 --> 01:21:08.397
Just a little more.

01:21:12.201 --> 01:21:14.337
I'm so hungry.

01:21:19.108 --> 01:21:20.076
So...

01:21:21.177 --> 01:21:22.045
Hungry!

01:21:22.045 --> 01:21:24.981
No, no, no, no!

01:21:25.982 --> 01:21:26.649
[Cornelila] Watch out!

01:21:27.483 --> 01:21:29.953
(Vine growls)

01:21:30.653 --> 01:21:33.456
(Fists smack)

01:21:35.391 --> 01:21:36.325
Vine!

01:21:48.271 --> 01:21:49.072
(Helo yells)

01:21:49.072 --> 01:21:53.176
(Fists smack)

01:21:55.979 --> 01:21:57.080
(Neck crunches)

01:21:58.547 --> 01:22:02.986
(Blood drips)
(Vine breathes heavily)

01:22:31.047 --> 01:22:32.648
Kill her, Interpreter!

01:22:38.587 --> 01:22:41.657
The sign was corrupt,
but it was correct.

01:22:42.425 --> 01:22:43.692
Fortune found you.

01:22:44.393 --> 01:22:45.728
You dreamed.

01:22:45.728 --> 01:22:48.231
You have been chosen to
join the Interpretee.

01:22:49.098 --> 01:22:50.499
Fortune has a test
for each of us.

01:22:51.200 --> 01:22:52.168
This is yours.

01:22:52.468 --> 01:22:54.603
Kill the girl, end this famine,

01:22:54.603 --> 01:22:56.505
And begin your training.

01:22:58.674 --> 01:22:59.975
(Vine yells)

01:23:03.046 --> 01:23:03.679
No!

01:23:05.714 --> 01:23:06.715
(Vine grunts)

01:23:18.461 --> 01:23:22.065
We are the disease.

01:23:24.333 --> 01:23:27.070
We don't belong here, Cornelia.

01:23:27.070 --> 01:23:28.671
Of course we belong here!

01:23:29.772 --> 01:23:31.440
We see everything.

01:23:31.674 --> 01:23:34.377
We know everything,
we live forever.

01:23:34.577 --> 01:23:36.345
We are perfect!

01:23:36.645 --> 01:23:38.281
We're freaks!

01:23:39.082 --> 01:23:40.283
Freaks!

01:23:41.317 --> 01:23:45.554
We have wings, and
claws, and horns.

01:23:46.322 --> 01:23:47.556
Like animals.

01:23:48.724 --> 01:23:52.495
And even then, no one sees us.

01:24:00.336 --> 01:24:01.204
She...

01:24:03.372 --> 01:24:04.673
Is beautiful.

01:24:07.543 --> 01:24:09.145
She's perfect.

01:24:11.580 --> 01:24:14.783
The world belongs to her.

01:24:18.821 --> 01:24:23.058
Maybe there's some
world we belong.

01:24:25.194 --> 01:24:26.562
But not this one.

01:24:29.332 --> 01:24:31.567
There is no other world, Adam.

01:24:32.635 --> 01:24:34.637
There's no where
else for us to go.

01:24:41.544 --> 01:24:43.646
As above, so below.

01:24:44.347 --> 01:24:46.182
As below, so above.

01:24:46.649 --> 01:24:50.386
(Speaks foreign language)

01:24:50.386 --> 01:24:52.288
No, no, no, no!

01:24:53.722 --> 01:24:54.757
(Cornelia gasps)

01:24:54.757 --> 01:24:58.093
(Heart beats)

01:25:07.703 --> 01:25:09.538
(Cornelia yells)

01:25:13.342 --> 01:25:14.777
Vine!

01:25:27.156 --> 01:25:30.226
What did you
dream, Interpreter?

01:25:31.494 --> 01:25:33.262
That I saved her.

01:25:33.862 --> 01:25:35.264
(Bone crunches)
(Cornelia gaps)

01:25:53.716 --> 01:25:54.683
Sara?

01:25:59.788 --> 01:26:01.156
Sara!

01:26:26.949 --> 01:26:28.317
(Zipper rasps)

01:26:50.473 --> 01:26:55.478
(Low, orchestral music)

01:26:58.614 --> 01:27:03.486
(Vine sobs)

01:27:40.889 --> 01:27:42.257
Oh, my God.

01:27:45.628 --> 01:27:48.831
(Vine sobs)
Oh, my God.

01:28:04.980 --> 01:28:07.049
(Wings flap)

01:28:07.783 --> 01:28:09.051
Where are you?

01:28:13.589 --> 01:28:15.558
Answer me!

01:28:52.060 --> 01:28:53.396
Hello, Vine.

01:28:53.729 --> 01:28:54.663
No.

01:28:58.000 --> 01:28:59.735
Why would you do this?

01:29:00.603 --> 01:29:02.070
Because I had to be sure.

01:29:02.805 --> 01:29:03.772
I looked for you.

01:29:04.440 --> 01:29:06.442
I rode on the back of Fortune,

01:29:06.442 --> 01:29:07.743
Through many worlds.

01:29:08.143 --> 01:29:09.378
And there you were.

01:29:09.845 --> 01:29:11.980
Obedient. Resigned.

01:29:12.448 --> 01:29:13.949
About to become an Interpreter.

01:29:15.818 --> 01:29:17.119
Do you remember the dream?

01:29:19.788 --> 01:29:21.590
That I saved her.

01:29:22.391 --> 01:29:23.892
A demon with a conscience.

01:29:24.159 --> 01:29:25.428
Who knew?

01:29:26.161 --> 01:29:27.563
And you killed her.

01:29:27.796 --> 01:29:28.697
Not me.

01:29:29.031 --> 01:29:30.499
Andre kills her.

01:29:31.967 --> 01:29:32.835
"Kills"?

01:29:33.168 --> 01:29:35.003
Kills, kill, killed.

01:29:35.003 --> 01:29:37.072
Will have killed, will kill.

01:29:37.072 --> 01:29:39.074
It's all the same to me.

01:29:42.945 --> 01:29:44.379
She's running away.

01:29:45.848 --> 01:29:48.517
She thinks he's
asleep, but he's not.

01:29:48.517 --> 01:29:49.585
(Belt jingles)

01:29:50.152 --> 01:29:51.654
It was her blood.

01:29:54.723 --> 01:29:56.391
(Belt jingles)

01:29:57.960 --> 01:29:59.428
But it wasn't human.

01:29:59.762 --> 01:30:00.896
Of course not.

01:30:01.530 --> 01:30:03.666
She's not a human,
she's a child.

01:30:03.966 --> 01:30:05.400
She's innocent.

01:30:07.936 --> 01:30:10.906
Do you want me to tell
you what he does to her
before he kills her?

01:30:10.906 --> 01:30:11.874
No.

01:30:13.075 --> 01:30:14.677
You're something else, demon.

01:30:14.910 --> 01:30:18.080
I will have to adjust, as
I have always adjusted.

01:30:19.515 --> 01:30:21.116
Doing something
she shouldn't have,

01:30:21.884 --> 01:30:24.553
Before it brought luck that
would've worked against me.

01:30:24.787 --> 01:30:26.555
It won't make a
difference in the end.

01:30:26.922 --> 01:30:28.724
My plan's already in motion.

01:30:28.724 --> 01:30:29.858
No, don't.

01:30:32.060 --> 01:30:32.961
Please.

01:30:35.698 --> 01:30:36.765
Please, don't.

01:30:36.765 --> 01:30:38.634
Don't destroy them.

01:30:39.768 --> 01:30:40.969
They are flawed.

01:30:42.104 --> 01:30:46.041
I know, but they are
perfectly flawed!

01:30:48.677 --> 01:30:50.579
It's us who don't belong.

01:30:50.579 --> 01:30:51.980
None of you belong.

01:30:54.717 --> 01:30:55.651
It's okay, Vine.

01:30:56.652 --> 01:30:57.886
The experiment's over.

01:30:59.021 --> 01:31:00.455
You're free to go.

01:31:01.490 --> 01:31:02.090
No.

01:31:02.658 --> 01:31:03.759
Bring her back.

01:31:05.694 --> 01:31:07.462
Bring her back!

01:31:07.863 --> 01:31:09.598
Bring them all back!

01:31:11.199 --> 01:31:12.467
You can.

01:31:13.235 --> 01:31:14.737
I know you can.

01:31:16.104 --> 01:31:17.906
I know your true name.

01:31:19.107 --> 01:31:20.475
Is that right?

01:31:21.109 --> 01:31:22.010
Tell me.

01:31:23.211 --> 01:31:24.913
You are the one thing.

01:31:26.682 --> 01:31:27.983
Ray...

01:31:27.983 --> 01:31:28.917
Enough!

01:31:33.055 --> 01:31:34.523
They must be whole.

01:31:35.524 --> 01:31:38.627
It has stripped the
body, as you said.

01:31:40.629 --> 01:31:41.496
So...

01:31:43.532 --> 01:31:44.900
What do I call you?

01:31:47.903 --> 01:31:50.739
(Demonic whispers)

01:31:50.739 --> 01:31:51.940
[Voiceover] The future.

01:32:21.269 --> 01:32:23.606
Shoulda ran while you
had the chance, girl.

01:32:23.939 --> 01:32:25.574
That doll ain't gonna save you.

01:32:25.908 --> 01:32:27.843
Ain't nothing
gonna save us, now.

01:32:28.777 --> 01:32:30.545
(Belt jingles)

01:32:31.580 --> 01:32:35.584
(Fists smack)
(Andre grunts repeatedly)

01:32:38.120 --> 01:32:39.655
Let me go, let me go!

01:32:39.655 --> 01:32:40.288
[Vine] Hey, hey, hey, whoa.

01:32:40.288 --> 01:32:41.824
Sara, Sara, wait.

01:32:43.091 --> 01:32:44.827
It's really good to see you.

01:32:46.194 --> 01:32:47.162
Shh, look, it's okay.

01:32:47.162 --> 01:32:50.833
Sara, everything's gonna
be okay from now on.

01:32:51.333 --> 01:32:52.334
I promise.

01:32:55.804 --> 01:32:57.139
You told him to kill me.

01:32:57.773 --> 01:32:58.907
And that was a mistake.

01:32:59.942 --> 01:33:01.343
Okay, a really big mistake.

01:33:01.343 --> 01:33:02.845
I won't make it again.

01:33:05.213 --> 01:33:06.615
You promise?

01:33:07.816 --> 01:33:09.952
I'm not gonna let
anything happen to you.

01:33:11.153 --> 01:33:12.187
You're safe.

01:33:13.221 --> 01:33:14.056
Okay?

01:33:16.091 --> 01:33:17.592
Now go on back up.

01:33:18.093 --> 01:33:20.262
Tell your mom Andre
won't be back for awhile.

01:33:21.029 --> 01:33:22.698
He's got a few
things to work out.

01:33:28.336 --> 01:33:29.304
Thank you.

01:33:33.175 --> 01:33:34.810
(Belt jingles)

01:33:40.816 --> 01:33:42.017
Hey Vine...

01:33:42.985 --> 01:33:45.020
I just woke up in
the goddamn basement.

01:33:53.128 --> 01:33:54.797
What the hell is going on?

01:33:56.832 --> 01:33:58.133
[Television announcer]
Officers have released the name

01:33:58.133 --> 01:34:00.335
Of the gang member
who brutally murdered

01:34:00.335 --> 01:34:02.304
Four tenants in his building.

01:34:02.705 --> 01:34:05.273
The 24 year old going
by the name Helo

01:34:05.273 --> 01:34:07.776
Was identified as Jason Miller.

01:34:07.976 --> 01:34:11.079
His victims are said to be two
of his fellow gang members,

01:34:11.079 --> 01:34:14.216
An elderly resident,
Cornelia Coranza,

01:34:14.216 --> 01:34:16.952
And the building's
manager, Patrick Dooley.

01:34:17.319 --> 01:34:20.155
In other news, a city-wide
alert has been issued

01:34:20.155 --> 01:34:24.760
For a white man last seen in
the 400 block of Wood Lake,

01:34:24.760 --> 01:34:26.161
In connection with the abduction

01:34:26.161 --> 01:34:28.897
Of five year old Jesus Gonzalez.

01:34:28.897 --> 01:34:30.432
The police have
no leads so far...

01:34:30.432 --> 01:34:31.900
Wood Lake, is
that close to here?

01:34:31.900 --> 01:34:34.169
No, no, nothing
like that's close.

01:34:34.169 --> 01:34:35.170
Not to you.

01:34:37.906 --> 01:34:39.141
(Knocking at door)

01:34:43.912 --> 01:34:45.113
Hi.

01:34:45.447 --> 01:34:47.082
Thanks for taking
care of her, Vine.

01:34:47.783 --> 01:34:48.817
I wish you'd let me pay you.

01:34:48.817 --> 01:34:50.953
Nah, when you get settled.

01:34:51.787 --> 01:34:52.921
How was the meeting?

01:34:54.056 --> 01:34:55.824
Um, it was good.

01:34:56.458 --> 01:34:57.760
It's tough but good.

01:34:58.961 --> 01:35:00.362
I hear Andre left town.

01:35:02.064 --> 01:35:03.799
Yeah?

01:35:05.834 --> 01:35:08.103
I don't know, maybe
I should've given
him a second chance.

01:35:09.404 --> 01:35:10.839
Well, maybe.

01:35:11.039 --> 01:35:13.175
But you only get so many
chances in this world.

01:35:13.508 --> 01:35:14.476
Hey kiddo.

01:35:14.910 --> 01:35:16.244
Come on, let's get dinner.

01:35:17.479 --> 01:35:18.480
[Sara] Can I come back later?

01:35:18.480 --> 01:35:21.249
[Vine] Oh, maybe, I'm
going out for a while.

01:35:21.249 --> 01:35:22.384
[Sara] Where you going?

01:35:22.918 --> 01:35:24.152
Just over to Wood Lake.

01:35:24.386 --> 01:35:25.720
I'm gonna check something out.

01:35:26.421 --> 01:35:27.355
(Hands smack)

01:35:29.958 --> 01:35:31.159
Thank you.

01:36:00.022 --> 01:36:02.490
[Vine] There are
signs everywhere.

01:36:03.792 --> 01:36:07.329
A floating leaf, a sound...

01:36:08.463 --> 01:36:10.065
A shadow.

01:36:14.302 --> 01:36:19.274
It's not the meaning, but
the sign that concerns us.

01:36:19.274 --> 01:36:23.946
(Dramatic orchestral music)

01:36:23.946 --> 01:36:25.113
Understand?

01:36:32.387 --> 01:36:37.325
(Low, jazzy, suspenseful music)

01:36:55.911 --> 01:37:00.248
(Dramatic orchestral music)

01:37:23.071 --> 01:37:26.374
