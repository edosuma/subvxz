WEBVTT

00:08.540 --> 00:11.452
BEACHWOOD, NEW JERSEY

00:19.210 --> 00:20.996
Kind of scary, huh?

00:21.000 --> 00:22.319
-What?
-The trees.

00:22.330 --> 00:26.164
They kind of look like those hooded
creatures in the movie, don't they?

00:29.000 --> 00:31.571
-Did you like the movie?
-I told you I did.

00:31.580 --> 00:33.787
No, no, you said, "yenah."

00:33.790 --> 00:37.999
"Yenah" is exactly halfway
between "yeah" and "nah."

00:38.580 --> 00:41.037
That's the kind of answer
I would tell my students is ambiguous.

00:41.040 --> 00:42.996
-Was that your intent?
-More or less.

00:45.080 --> 00:49.870
Oh, bud, I know it's tough on you
but, hey, look, think on the bright side.

00:49.880 --> 00:51.108
You know, every other week

00:51.120 --> 00:53.827
we get to stay up late, eat junk food,
and go see movies

00:53.830 --> 00:56.913
your mom would never
let you see in a million years.

01:02.080 --> 01:03.741
What are you doing?

01:06.830 --> 01:09.116
-You didn't |s\lee that deer?
- o.

01:09.540 --> 01:12.168
-Where?
-It's gone. It must've... Wow.

01:12.830 --> 01:15.412
-Must've run away.
-Whatever.

01:20.670 --> 01:22.956
-What?
-Oh, it's a flat.

01:22.960 --> 01:25.997
We must've blown a tire
driving on the shoulder.

01:31.960 --> 01:33.916
I'll be right back.

01:33.920 --> 01:36.957
-Maybe we should call someone?
-It's a flat tire. It's, you know...

01:36.960 --> 01:40.532
Despite what your mom says I'm not
completely useless. I'll be right back.

02:08.540 --> 02:09.746
Hello?

02:10.790 --> 02:12.951
-What is it, Dad?
-Nothing. It's just the...

02:12.960 --> 02:16.077
It's just the wind, Eric.
Get back in the car.

02:27.210 --> 02:29.326
It's all right. It's all right.
It's all right. It's just me.

02:29.330 --> 02:31.821
It's just clumsy me. It's all right.

02:38.960 --> 02:40.200
Hello?

02:40.830 --> 02:42.036
Who's there?

02:42.040 --> 02:44.998
-What is it, Dad?
-Stay in the car!

02:48.080 --> 02:49.661
Stop. Get away.

02:50.420 --> 02:53.287
Who are you? Get away!

02:54.120 --> 02:56.418
What do you want? Get away!

02:56.420 --> 03:01.119
Get away from my son!
Get away! Get away from my son!

03:47.250 --> 03:49.286
Get away! Get away! Get away!

03:49.290 --> 03:52.111
Hey. Hey. Calm down inside there.
Calm down!

03:52.120 --> 03:54.532
Yeah, I'm going to need some backup.
Just past exit 5.

03:54.540 --> 03:56.201
Car on the shoulder of the road.

03:56.210 --> 04:00.419
Lone male in the driver's seat.
Under the influence of something.

04:05.210 --> 04:07.701
Wait. There might be another one.

04:12.960 --> 04:15.201
I'm gonna need an ambulance!

04:21.330 --> 04:24.242
State trooper took this
before the paramedics showed up.

04:24.250 --> 04:26.912
He's unconscious. Has four broken bones.

04:26.920 --> 04:29.821
He's going to be in the hospital
for a month...

04:29.830 --> 04:32.037
I didn't hurt my son!

04:33.620 --> 04:36.248
Do you remember
removing the tire iron from the trunk?

04:36.250 --> 04:37.615
No. No!

04:38.290 --> 04:40.451
What's the last thing you do remember?

04:40.460 --> 04:42.951
I picked Eric up from school.

04:43.500 --> 04:46.162
Friday, for the weekend.

04:47.460 --> 04:48.609
What day is this?

04:48.620 --> 04:50.076
F.B.I., Behavioral Analysis Unit
QUANTICO, VIRGINIA

04:50.080 --> 04:52.036
This happened two days ago
in Beachwood, New Jersey.

04:52.040 --> 04:53.780
Mr. Fisher had ingested LSD one afternoon

04:53.790 --> 04:56.327
and didn't come down until 18 hours later.

04:56.330 --> 05:00.744
The hospital reported six other patients
who ingested LSD in the last 24 hours.

05:00.750 --> 05:03.412
The hospital called the CDC.
The CDC called us.

05:03.420 --> 05:06.241
So a bunch of people got spiked.
What makes it a BAU case?

05:06.250 --> 05:09.037
They each received
10 to 20 times the normal dose.

05:09.040 --> 05:10.996
That's enough to kill a small child.

05:11.000 --> 05:13.616
Or cause a grown man
to kill him with a tire iron.

05:13.620 --> 05:16.703
Of the seven victims,
there was one death and one coma.

05:16.710 --> 05:20.749
This is from hospital security footage
the same night Fisher lost it.

05:26.830 --> 05:28.957
These people didn't get spiked.

05:29.880 --> 05:32.030
These people were poisoned.

06:14.670 --> 06:16.820
Roman philosopher Lucretius wrote,

06:16.830 --> 06:20.459
"What is food to one,
is to others bitter poison."

06:21.170 --> 06:25.038
Of the seven victims, Gail Norman
was the only death. She was 78.

06:25.040 --> 06:28.328
Ran out in the middle of the road
and was hit by a car. She was DOA.

06:28.330 --> 06:31.663
The other potentially fatal case
is 9-year-old Britney Cannon.

06:31.670 --> 06:33.786
She fell out of a tree house
and fractured her skull.

06:33.790 --> 06:36.668
She's in a coma and the doctors don't
know If she's gomg to come out of It.

06:36.670 --> 06:37.910
How do you want to handle the press?

06:37.920 --> 06:39.956
We still don't even know
how these people got dosed.

06:39.960 --> 06:42.702
I think it would be irresponsible
to issue a warning without specifics.

06:42.710 --> 06:43.950
It'll just cause panic.

06:43.960 --> 06:46.997
I did notify the local P.D.,
though, to be discreet.

06:47.000 --> 06:49.707
How is it possible that none of these
people knew how they got poisoned?

06:49.710 --> 06:51.610
None of them remembers anything
about the day it happened.

06:51.620 --> 06:53.076
And these people were so messed up

06:53.080 --> 06:56.538
it's made it difficult for local P.D.
to retrace the victims' steps.

06:56.540 --> 06:58.030
So we need to go on precedent.

06:58.040 --> 07:01.612
We know there are four types of
poisoners who target multiple victims.

07:01.620 --> 07:02.780
There's the True Believer.

07:02.790 --> 07:05.497
The political terrorists
slash religious cult.

07:05.500 --> 07:07.570
There's the Extortionist.
Product tamperer

07:07.580 --> 07:09.787
who holds a business hostage
in exchange for money.

07:09.790 --> 07:11.075
Or the Prankster.

07:11.080 --> 07:14.664
Usually a younger offender
who doesn't mean any harm.

07:14.670 --> 07:17.070
And it's basically
just a big practical joke.

07:17.080 --> 07:18.490
And the Avenger.

07:18.500 --> 07:22.618
Someone with a personal vendetta
who chooses poison as their weapon.

07:22.620 --> 07:25.282
So we need to find out
as quickly as possible which type he is.

07:25.290 --> 07:26.609
Because with the exception
of the prankster,

07:26.620 --> 07:29.077
all these types commonly
test their poison on a small scale

07:29.080 --> 07:30.661
before carrying out a larger attack.

07:30.670 --> 07:32.456
Let's hope this was just a prank.

07:32.460 --> 07:34.451
I would suggest
we split up the victims

07:34.460 --> 07:36.530
and see if there's a pattern
to the victimology.

07:36.540 --> 07:39.703
Most of them are still at the hospital.
I'll call local P.D. to meet us there.

07:39.710 --> 07:41.996
I'll check the lab reports.
Maybe there's a clue

07:42.000 --> 07:45.379
to the UnSub's motive in the specific
nature of the poison he used.

07:45.380 --> 07:48.668
I can't imagine anybody
could want this to happen.

08:01.670 --> 08:05.037
-Detective Hanover, Beachwood P.D.
-Agent Hotchner. This is Agent Gideon.

08:05.040 --> 08:07.452
Thanks for coming down
on such short notice.

08:07.460 --> 08:09.872
Doctors said he may have
permanent brain damage.

08:09.880 --> 08:12.166
-I've never seen anything like this.
-Well, let's hope we can help.

08:12.170 --> 08:14.070
Have you had a chance
to review the victim's files?

08:14.080 --> 08:16.537
We're especially interested
in talking to the boy's father.

08:16.540 --> 08:18.576
We'd like to get a sense
of why he turned violent.

08:18.580 --> 08:21.572
While the lab analyses the specific
nature of the LSD he was dosed with,

08:21.580 --> 08:22.820
we'd like to get our own sense.

08:22.830 --> 08:25.572
Was it the drug itself
or was it something else going on?

08:25.580 --> 08:27.707
And hopefully that can give us
a little bit of a window

08:27.710 --> 08:30.167
into the motive of the offender.

08:31.120 --> 08:33.611
-Well, he's in the psych ward.
-Yeah, we'll keep it short.

08:33.620 --> 08:35.167
Dr. Kelly to fast-track treatment.

08:35.170 --> 08:36.660
Dr. Kelly to fast-track treatment.

08:41.500 --> 08:43.786
-Mr. Fisher

08:43.790 --> 08:46.998
I'm an FBI profiler.
So I guess I'm a little of each.

08:47.750 --> 08:49.456
I'm Jason Gideon.

08:50.790 --> 08:53.668
I can't imagine what you've been through.

08:54.420 --> 08:57.878
I understand you recently divorced
your wife. Can you tell me why?

08:57.880 --> 08:59.780
What do you want to know?

08:59.790 --> 09:02.577
Was I angry about the divorce?
I mean was I...

09:02.580 --> 09:05.037
Was I so angry that I wanted
to hurt my son to get back at her?

09:05.040 --> 09:07.372
-Is that what you want to know

09:07.380 --> 09:10.497
Let me tell you something
about my wife, okay?

09:11.210 --> 09:12.825
About what she did.

09:12.830 --> 09:14.286
In my house.

09:15.250 --> 09:16.706
In my bed.

09:17.250 --> 09:19.957
With the investment banker next door.

09:20.920 --> 09:23.992
But you want to know
what the worst part is?

09:24.330 --> 09:25.877
My son, Eric,

09:27.620 --> 09:29.281
he's angry with me.

09:29.290 --> 09:31.030
She's the cheater.

09:33.040 --> 09:35.577
And he's angry at me. Me!

09:36.290 --> 09:38.030
What did you do?

09:38.040 --> 09:40.531
-Did you want to hurt her?
-Of course.

09:40.540 --> 09:43.782
And the kid. I mean it's her kid, right?
I mean, he takes her side.

09:43.790 --> 09:45.417
You want to crush him, too?

09:45.420 --> 09:48.116
_ You_want to shut his
obnoxrous little mouth up for good?

09:48.120 --> 09:51.032
-No. No. He doesn't understand.
-Why?

09:51.040 --> 09:52.109
But he took her side.

09:52.120 --> 09:54.111
I'm sure it's not the first time
he's done that, sir.

09:54.120 --> 09:56.611
No. Eric. Oh, oh, Eric.

09:58.330 --> 10:00.491
Why did this happen to you?

10:01.880 --> 10:03.529
Why did this happen to you?

10:03.540 --> 10:05.576
-Why Why?
-Mr. Fisher. Mr. Fisher.

10:05.580 --> 10:07.821
Calm down. Hold your head
forward. Hold your head forward.

10:07.830 --> 10:09.741
Come on. Come on. Come on.

10:12.380 --> 10:15.372
He's raw, broken,
and seriously pissed off.

10:16.080 --> 10:18.378
But he didn't hurt the son
to get back at the mother.

10:18.380 --> 10:20.746
Not consciously, no.

10:20.750 --> 10:25.164
The rage was real, but understandable.
And he never apologized.

10:25.170 --> 10:27.661
When he lost control,
he didn't even say, "Eric, I'm sorry."

10:27.670 --> 10:29.877
He said, "Eric, why'd this happen to you?"

10:29.880 --> 10:32.246
He never even confessed
to hurting the kid.

10:32.250 --> 10:34.571
So the drugs tapped into the rage,
but didn't cause it.

10:34.580 --> 10:35.786
That's my guess.

10:35.790 --> 10:39.032
_That's consistent with information we
just received from the lab tox screens.

10:39.040 --> 10:41.531
They didn't find any trace of PCP
or any other drug

10:41.540 --> 10:44.418
indicating the UnSub was intentionally
trying to make people violent,

10:44.420 --> 10:47.571
but they did find traces of Rohypnol
in all the victims.

10:47.580 --> 10:49.457
A central nervous system depressant.

10:49.460 --> 10:52.247
It's similar to Valium,
only 10 times more potent.

10:52.250 --> 10:54.957
It's commonly known as a roofie,
or a date rape drug.

10:54.960 --> 10:57.246
Right. And one of its side effects
is amnesia,

10:57.250 --> 10:59.957
which explains why none of the victims
remember how they were poisoned.

10:59.960 --> 11:01.700
We compared notes
on the victims we talked to.

11:01.710 --> 11:04.372
So far, there doesn't seem to be
any pattern as to who got hit.

11:04.380 --> 11:05.824
Maybe the drugs themselves can explain

11:05.830 --> 11:07.707
what type of offender we're dealing with.

11:07.710 --> 11:10.247
A lot of kids are using LSD
and Rohypnol these days.

11:10.250 --> 11:13.458
-Fisher's a high school teacher.
-So it may be a prank after all.

11:13.460 --> 11:15.280
Yeah, one that went horribly wrong.

11:15.290 --> 11:18.532
You know, I'm going to get a list of
students from Fisher. See you later.

11:19.880 --> 11:21.108
Hotch.

11:22.210 --> 11:24.451
Okay, we'll be right there.

11:24.460 --> 11:28.112
Cops may have figured out
where everybody was closed.

11:43.210 --> 11:44.825
Nice to see you.

11:45.250 --> 11:47.957
Uniforms were on a canvass.
The staff here remembers seeing

11:47.960 --> 11:50.576
four out of the seven victims here
the day they reported symptoms.

11:50.580 --> 11:54.744
Please tell me your staff didn't mention
the canvass was about a poisoning.

11:54.750 --> 11:56.911
They didn't, but I had to tell the owner.

11:56.920 --> 11:59.036
It's normal.

11:59.040 --> 12:00.530
Nell Trucco.

12:01.750 --> 12:03.615
I'd be shocked
if this doesn't get leaked now.

12:03.620 --> 12:06.578
I just hope nobody jumps
to the conclusion it's bioterrorism.

12:06.580 --> 12:08.536
All right, I'm going to go talk
to the caf staff,

12:08.540 --> 12:09.996
make sure they know to keep it quiet.

12:10.000 --> 12:13.072
Can you think of anyone
who'd do something like this?

12:13.080 --> 12:14.707
High school kids hanging around?

12:14.710 --> 12:17.372
Honestly, I can't tell them apart.
You should talk to Danny.

12:17.380 --> 12:19.996
-Danny?
-A busboy. High school kid.

12:20.000 --> 12:23.037
A lot of his friends come in here.
His girlfriend was here Saturday night.

12:23.040 --> 12:24.246
Is he here today?

12:24.250 --> 12:26.707
He was supposed to come to work
after school, but he called in sick.

12:26.710 --> 12:29.031
-What's his last name?
-Wallace.

12:29.040 --> 12:33.033
Got a phone number for him?

12:33.790 --> 12:37.248
Hotch. I checked the high school
and Wallace's house. He wasn't there.

12:37.250 --> 12:39.957
So, now I'm at his girlfriend's house.

12:39.960 --> 12:42.030
Okay. I'll call you back.

12:49.080 --> 12:50.786
-Samantha?
-Yeah.

12:50.790 --> 12:54.112
I'm with the FBI.
Can I talk to you for a minute?

13:03.790 --> 13:06.281
-Where are your parents?
-Working.

13:07.580 --> 13:08.740
What do you want?

13:08.750 --> 13:10.706
Well, you didn't go to school today,
Samantha.

13:10.710 --> 13:12.917
-And neither did your boyfriend.
-I'm sick.

13:22.420 --> 13:24.957
Can I ask you something personal?

13:26.170 --> 13:29.492
I think that something
might have happened to you.

13:30.080 --> 13:33.664
-You want to tell me about it?
-I don't know.

13:36.290 --> 13:39.669
-I don't remember.
-What do you remember?

13:39.670 --> 13:43.037
He took me someplace on his motorcycle.

13:43.040 --> 13:46.783
I remember waking up.

13:47.580 --> 13:49.491
I was naked,

13:51.000 --> 13:52.786
I was all beat up.

13:53.580 --> 13:56.743
And he was there, above me,

13:59.920 --> 14:01.615
holding me down.

14:02.080 --> 14:03.411
Who was?

14:04.460 --> 14:05.609
Danny.

14:06.790 --> 14:10.533
I called the doctor earlier.
It could be her.

14:11.920 --> 14:13.205
Samantha, listen to me.

14:13.210 --> 14:15.201
Don't hang up. Do you hear me?

14:15.210 --> 14:16.609
-Keep him talking-Samantha?

14:16.620 --> 14:19.953
-What do you want?-Someone's there.

14:19.960 --> 14:21.700
Who did you call?

14:22.710 --> 14:26.077
-Why do you think someone's
here?-Don't mess with me, Samantha.

14:26.080 --> 14:28.492
Don't do it. If you say anything.

14:29.460 --> 14:31.610
-He hung up.
-Come with me.

14:32.830 --> 14:34.491
You're going to call 911.

14:34.500 --> 14:37.572
And as soon as I leave
you lock the door behind me.

14:37.580 --> 14:38.820
Do it.

14:39.330 --> 14:41.707
Well, he's near his girlfriend's house.

14:42.920 --> 14:47.072
Hillcrest and Maple and...
I can't see the other cross street.

14:47.710 --> 14:49.325
Yeah. Okay.

15:01.000 --> 15:03.878
Danny Wallace. Stop! FBI!

15:04.420 --> 15:07.492
You put your hands
on top of your head. Off the bike.

15:08.750 --> 15:10.240
On your head.

15:18.420 --> 15:22.242
This isn't what you had in mind when
you skipped school today, is it, Danny?

15:30.330 --> 15:32.662
You want to_ tell us
about Saturday night, Danny?

15:32.670 --> 15:34.535
I didn't do anything.

15:34.920 --> 15:36.706
Samantha doesn't know
what she's talking about.

15:36.710 --> 15:40.828
A lot of people saw you together
at the caf on Saturday night.

15:41.250 --> 15:43.161
What did you decide to do, Danny?

15:43.170 --> 15:45.286
Dose the common milk
so that nobody would know

15:45.290 --> 15:47.246
that you just wanted
to roofie your girlfriend?

15:47.250 --> 15:48.410
That's not true.

15:48.420 --> 15:51.662
Sex was an issue in your relationship.
She told me about it.

15:51.670 --> 15:53.069
She wasn't prepared to give it up

15:53.080 --> 15:55.036
-so you decided to take it.
-No.

15:55.040 --> 15:57.952
She had bruises all over her body,
Danny. You hit her.

15:57.960 --> 16:00.827
Well, I didn't mean to.
She was freaking out, punching me.

16:00.830 --> 16:03.913
She was on something
and I was just trying to help her.

16:03.920 --> 16:05.114
I was trying to hold her down.

16:05.120 --> 16:07.532
She was hitting you,
but you still had sex with her?

16:07.540 --> 16:09.747
Then what, Danny?

16:09.750 --> 16:12.378
Well, it was after! After we did it!

16:12.380 --> 16:14.575
We fell asleep. But when she woke up
she was seeing things.

16:14.580 --> 16:17.538
-What things?
-Look, she was on something.

16:17.540 --> 16:20.919
And if it was acid or whatever,
I've taken that.

16:20.920 --> 16:23.036
You give that to someone
without telling them,

16:23.040 --> 16:25.201
it doesn't exactly set the mood.

16:25.210 --> 16:26.916
The kid is right about that.

16:26.920 --> 16:28.535
If he wanted to slip a girl
a date-rape drug,

16:28.540 --> 16:30.371
why did he give her LSD, too?

16:30.380 --> 16:33.452
This boy seems too scared
not to be telling us the truth.

16:33.460 --> 16:34.825
So Samantha was just the eighth victim

16:34.830 --> 16:37.378
and the boyfriend working at the caf
was just a coincidence.

16:37.380 --> 16:41.032
But even so, there may be an
explanation of why the two drugs.

16:41.040 --> 16:43.668
LSD to hallucinate and Rohypnol to forget.

16:43.670 --> 16:46.161
Forget what

16:46.170 --> 16:47.614
No. How they got dosed.

16:47.620 --> 16:49.326
And the UnSub's
covering his tracks.

16:49.330 --> 16:51.571
That's much too organized
for a high school prank.

16:51.580 --> 16:54.378
And there still hasn't been
any kind of ransom demand.

16:54.380 --> 16:56.280
Which rules out the Extortionist.

16:56.290 --> 16:58.872
Or any invisible political group
or cult in the area.

16:58.880 --> 17:02.873
-Which rules out the True Believer.
-And leaves us with the Avenger.

17:02.880 --> 17:05.030
We can give them a profile.

17:06.790 --> 17:10.703
We believe whoever poisoned these
people was motivated by revenge.

17:10.710 --> 17:12.246
The randomness of the victimology.

17:12.250 --> 17:16.289
Average people in an average sized
town, all points to a local resident.

17:16.290 --> 17:18.952
We know that people who poison
for the purposes of revenge

17:18.960 --> 17:20.416
primarily act alone.

17:20.420 --> 17:23.617
However, he may have manipulated
someone close to him to assist him.

17:23.620 --> 17:25.918
The UnSub usually disposes
of these accomplices

17:25.920 --> 17:27.490
when they are of no further use to him.

17:27.500 --> 17:31.379
The UnSub is likely
a cautious, deliberate,

17:31.380 --> 17:35.919
and highly functioning male
between the ages of 35 and 50.

17:35.920 --> 17:39.572
He chose LSD for a reason.
LSD is about altering perception.

17:39.580 --> 17:41.957
We think that this UnSub
is striking out because he feels

17:41.960 --> 17:45.782
that he's been inaccurately perceived
by the community or a subset of it.

17:45.790 --> 17:49.703
He feels that these attacks will affect
and alter a reality that he IS caught In

17:49.710 --> 17:51.530
that he perceives to be unjust.

17:51.540 --> 17:53.496
He's so self-centered
he believes his victims

17:53.500 --> 17:55.912
will know the reason for the attack
and who did it.

17:55.920 --> 17:58.411
This individual was savvy enough
to use Rohypnol

17:58.420 --> 17:59.876
to obstruct our investigation,

17:59.880 --> 18:02.451
erasing the memories of the victims
of how they were poisoned.

18:02.460 --> 18:06.874
Hold on, if this guy believes
that his victims know who he is,

18:06.880 --> 18:08.199
why is he covering his tracks?

18:08.210 --> 18:10.952
Because these victims
aren't hIs primary targets.

18:10.960 --> 18:13.872
We know from precedent that
this kind of offender, the Avenger,

18:13.880 --> 18:17.281
tests his weapon first.
This attack was a test run.

18:17.580 --> 18:19.377
We don't know, yet.

18:19.380 --> 18:22.531
What we do know is this is not the
first time he's aired his grievances.

18:22.540 --> 18:25.418
While it's not likely
that he has a criminal record,

18:25.420 --> 18:28.662
it is possible that
he has filed criminal charges

18:28.670 --> 18:31.241
or pursued a civil action
against his perceived adversaries.

18:31.250 --> 18:33.206
-I'm going to go to court and sue them.
-I'm sorry.

18:33.210 --> 18:37.032
And now to measure
the results of his test, he's watching.

18:38.210 --> 18:40.952
And he wants to see
the results of his test.

18:40.960 --> 18:42.996
Once he has them,
all those years of pent-up rage

18:43.000 --> 18:45.707
will be unleashed
in the form of a larger attack.

18:45.710 --> 18:48.031
Profile indicates
a lot of people could die.

18:48.040 --> 18:49.610
We had a leak.

18:50.420 --> 18:53.537
That's right, Steve, neighbours
became aware something was wrong

18:53.540 --> 18:56.247
when a local Beachwood restaurant
closed early.

18:56.250 --> 18:59.538
From inside sources, we learnt
that representatives of the CDC

18:59.540 --> 19:01.781
began testing food
inside the restaurant this morning.

19:01.790 --> 19:03.872
If you're going to report the story,
name the restaurant.

19:03.880 --> 19:05.825
Though unconfirmed, we were told
that some of the food

19:05.830 --> 19:08.458
had apparently been tainted
with hallucinogenic drugs.

19:08.460 --> 19:09.700
Name the restaurant.

19:09.710 --> 19:11.075
Before we do confirm all of this,

19:11.080 --> 19:13.162
we will not release
the name of the restaurant,

19:13.170 --> 19:16.207
we'll only say
it's a Beachwood area favourite.

19:16.210 --> 19:19.828
This is Suzanne Whang reporting live
from Beachwood. Back to you, Steve.

19:19.830 --> 19:21.957
-They didn't name the restaurant.
-What is it?

19:21.960 --> 19:24.497
Call the local hospital. Make sure
they know what's coming. Excuse me.

19:24.500 --> 19:26.115
Where do your 911 calls get routed?

19:26.120 --> 19:27.997
There's a county phone bank.

19:28.000 --> 19:30.377
They contact first responders,
the fire department.

19:30.380 --> 19:32.575
Alert them, too. They're going to need
additional personnel

19:32.580 --> 19:34.707
and any other backup you've got,
auxiliary cops.

19:34.710 --> 19:36.416
-You're going to have to call them.
-But why?

19:36.420 --> 19:38.786
Because we're going to have a heck
of a time just calming people down.

19:38.790 --> 19:41.577
And we really don't need the confusion
to interfere with our investigation.

19:41.580 --> 19:43.161
Look, you want me
to start making those calls?

19:43.170 --> 19:46.788
No, no, no, no. Hey! Hey!
Everybody please shut up for a minute!

19:48.670 --> 19:49.955
Tell me what this is all about.

20:00.880 --> 20:02.074
Panic.

20:04.960 --> 20:06.575
We can't comment.

20:06.580 --> 20:09.492
No, we still don't know for sure
why those people were poisoned.

20:09.500 --> 20:11.491
Okay, great. Thank you.

20:12.420 --> 20:14.285
I just got off with the hospital.

20:14.290 --> 20:16.497
They're swamped
with over 50 potential poisonings

20:16.500 --> 20:19.572
from local restaurants.
But no hallucmatlons.

20:19.580 --> 20:22.071
Or maybe more hysteria.

20:22.080 --> 20:24.992
We've looked into any civil
or criminal complaints from employees,

20:25.000 --> 20:28.879
ex-employees, suppliers,
regulars of the caf. Not one good lead.

20:28.880 --> 20:31.667
There's got to be somebody connected
to that caf who'll pop as a suspect.

20:31.670 --> 20:34.070
Morgan, you want to go back there

20:34.080 --> 20:35.786
Couldn't hurt.
HOTCH: JJ,

20:35.790 --> 20:38.532
you and Reid go to the hospital.
See if any of the poisonings seem legit.

20:38.540 --> 20:39.666
Okay.

20:43.790 --> 20:46.327
I really can't talk right now.
We just got hammered.

20:46.330 --> 20:50.118
Listen. Most of these food
poisonings are probably psychosomatic.

20:50.120 --> 20:51.667
What makes you think that?

20:51.670 --> 20:54.992
A news broadcast just reported
a local restaurant was poisoned.

20:55.000 --> 20:56.911
Now, it would be a huge coincidence

20:56.920 --> 20:59.206
if there was another poisoning
right after that aired.

20:59.210 --> 21:00.416
So what do you want me to do?

21:00.420 --> 21:03.958
Help us figure out which cases,
if any, are real.

21:03.960 --> 21:06.076
People are coming in
with all kinds of complaints.

21:06.080 --> 21:09.243
But there's at least one case
that Isn't psychosomatic.

21:09.250 --> 21:10.456
She's barely breathing.

21:10.460 --> 21:12.997
Can you take us to the doctor
that's treating that patient?

21:13.000 --> 21:14.706
I'll call Hotch.

21:17.880 --> 21:19.245
All right.

21:20.580 --> 21:24.164
If you're an Avenger, you choose
your target for a reason, right?

21:24.170 --> 21:26.161
Well, then why haven't we found
anyone connected to this caf

21:26.170 --> 21:27.376
who fits the profile?

21:27.380 --> 21:30.611
Why hasn't the CDC
found any trace of the drugs?

21:31.580 --> 21:33.161
Wait a minute.

21:33.540 --> 21:35.826
What if it's not the profile that's wrong,
but the target?

21:35.830 --> 21:37.070
Not this caf?

21:37.080 --> 21:38.570
Just because a bunch of victims
came to eat here,

21:38.580 --> 21:40.912
doesn't necessarily mean
they get poisoned here.

21:40.920 --> 21:42.376
Then where?

21:43.250 --> 21:44.660
When the patient got here.

21:44.670 --> 21:46.240
Couldn't remember anything about her day

21:46.250 --> 21:49.037
and her speech was so slurred
I could barely understand her.

21:49.040 --> 21:51.201
Sounds like Rohypnol. Did you test her?

21:51.210 --> 21:53.166
She was positive for Rohypnol,
negative for LSD.

21:55.170 --> 21:56.455
But we're running more tests

21:56.460 --> 21:59.998
because Rohypnol alone
doesn't explain her symptoms.

22:00.000 --> 22:04.619
She presented with nausea, difficulty
swallowing, and laboured breathing.

22:04.620 --> 22:07.248
She was also having trouble
moving her legs.

22:09.710 --> 22:12.372
-How long has she been sick?
-She didn't know.

22:12.380 --> 22:15.110
I could barely understand her
when she first got here.

22:15.120 --> 22:16.496
Now she can't speak at all.

22:16.500 --> 22:20.493
Do you know of biological agents
that have that similar symptom?

22:20.500 --> 22:22.070
Ricin, sarin gas.

22:22.080 --> 22:23.741
Do you think this is a biological attack?

22:23.750 --> 22:26.071
You can't rule anything out.

22:26.080 --> 22:28.321
I'll order a few more tests.

22:31.620 --> 22:33.372
That's where I had my business account.

22:33.380 --> 22:34.916
Thanks, Nell.

22:35.290 --> 22:38.578
No soda machines, hot dog stands,
water fountains or anything else.

22:38.580 --> 22:40.070
-You get anything?
-Maybe.

22:40.080 --> 22:43.038
First New Jersey Federal
right across the street.

22:43.040 --> 22:44.951
One of the victims who I talked to

22:44.960 --> 22:47.747
said that he went to that bank
on the day that he was closed.

22:47.750 --> 22:49.741
-How do you get poisoned at a bank?
-I don't know.

22:49.750 --> 22:52.207
But I'd like to take a look
at the security tapes.

22:52.210 --> 22:53.609
After you.

22:54.830 --> 22:58.288
Security Office
FIRST NEW JERSEY FEDERAL BANK

23:02.120 --> 23:04.372
Right there. Pause it, Elle.

23:05.170 --> 23:06.319
Jack Fisher.

23:06.330 --> 23:08.116
About to have the worst night of his life.

23:08.120 --> 23:10.281
That's all of them.
Every one of the victims

23:10.290 --> 23:13.828
who turned up at the ER
three nights ago is on this tape.

23:13.830 --> 23:16.572
-I'm going to call Hanover.
-Have him bring the CDC guys.

23:16.580 --> 23:19.492
They can test the candies.
I'll call Hotch.

23:19.500 --> 23:22.242
Morgan, it's Hotch. What's up?

23:26.210 --> 23:29.282
Reid.
I think she's trying to say something.

23:31.120 --> 23:32.610
The en...

23:34.040 --> 23:35.246
The end?

23:35.250 --> 23:37.957
She may be incoherent from lack of owgen.

23:37.960 --> 23:39.951
It's the en...

23:41.790 --> 23:43.030
Doctor.

23:47.040 --> 23:48.780
Now, Hotch,
we're pretty sure it's the bank.

23:48.790 --> 23:50.781
All the victims
are on their security tapes.

23:50.790 --> 23:52.997
Then you should look for Lynn Dempsey, 45.

23:53.000 --> 23:54.570
Garcia's e-mailing a picture
to your phone.

23:54.580 --> 23:56.957
Hold on a second, I'm checking.

23:58.170 --> 23:59.819
Yeah. Yeah I got it.

23:59.830 --> 24:02.116
Lynn Dempsey. Hold on. Elle.

24:05.750 --> 24:07.320
Elle's checking.

24:09.380 --> 24:11.416
Yeah, we got her, Hotch.

24:12.040 --> 24:13.780
Checking the tape.

24:15.210 --> 24:18.111
Right there. That's her.
-Play it again.

24:22.330 --> 24:24.321
Okay, not only was she here,
but from one of these tapes

24:24.330 --> 24:26.878
it looks like she was the one
replacmg the candles.

24:26.880 --> 24:29.166
-Hotch, she could be the UnSub.-Or working with him.

24:29.170 --> 24:31.161
I'll call you back.

24:31.880 --> 24:34.371
So what are the chances
that she's not p0|soned?

24:34.380 --> 24:35.916
That maybe she just got some bad food?

24:35.920 --> 24:38.912
Highly improbable.
Chances are basically nil.

24:38.920 --> 24:44.119
-What is the rate of survival Without antitoxin? Zero.

24:44.120 --> 24:46.031
-What is it?
-Botulism.

24:47.000 --> 24:49.070
Doctor, her BP is dropping rapidly.

24:49.080 --> 24:51.822
It's sepsis.
Give another amp of epi.

24:51.830 --> 24:53.377
She's going into v-fib.

24:53.380 --> 24:55.746
She's crashing. Get the paddles.

24:55.750 --> 24:57.786
Charging to 200.
DOCTOR: Clear.

24:58.290 --> 25:00.918
Nothing. Charging to 300.

25:00.920 --> 25:02.205
Clear.
NURSE: Still nothing.

25:02.210 --> 25:03.780
The test run is over.

25:03.790 --> 25:06.247
Page a code blue.
NURSE: Yes, Doctor. Right away.

25:06.250 --> 25:07.740
Starting CPR.

25:18.790 --> 25:21.918
Just be careful the fresh air
doesn't kill you, Fred.

25:22.540 --> 25:24.667
See you in a few days, Janice.

25:24.670 --> 25:27.161
And don't stay late. Your kids need you.

25:27.170 --> 25:29.411
Thanks, Mr. Devons. Have fun.

25:46.790 --> 25:49.111
Lynn Dempsey was
an executive assistant.

25:49.120 --> 25:51.827
She has no expertise with chemicals.

25:52.580 --> 25:54.320
She doesn't fit the profile of the UnSub.

25:54.330 --> 25:57.288
But the CDC found both LSD
and Rohypnol in the candies

25:57.290 --> 25:59.952
-she was replacing at the bank.
-She must have been an accomplice.

25:59.960 --> 26:02.201
And when the UnSub
finished using her to further his attack,

26:02.210 --> 26:03.825
he killed her with botulism.

26:03.830 --> 26:05.491
So what does that tell us about the UnSub?

26:05.500 --> 26:07.912
That he's far more sophisticated
than we realized.

26:07.920 --> 26:09.114
Why is that?

26:09.120 --> 26:12.032
Botulinum toxin is
the deadly substance known to man.

26:12.040 --> 26:13.871
It blocks acetylcholine receptors,

26:13.880 --> 26:17.168
paralyzing its victims
until basically choking you to death.

26:17.170 --> 26:21.209
Without a antitoxin,
a lethal dose will kill you in 36 hours.

26:21.210 --> 26:23.075
How many people have access to this stuff?

26:23.080 --> 26:24.456
In New Jersey, quite a few.

26:24.460 --> 26:27.111
It's the pharmaceutical
and chemical capital of the US

26:27.120 --> 26:29.452
The toxin can be ordered
in the form of BOTOX

26:29.460 --> 26:32.702
through any chemical or biological lab
or BOTOX clinic.

26:32.710 --> 26:36.783
It has to be purified, but any chemist
or lab assistant has that capability.

26:36.790 --> 26:40.499
So we're looking for chemists
and sophisticated lab assistants?

26:40.500 --> 26:42.377
Okay, wait a minute.

26:42.380 --> 26:45.668
If the UnSub is a chemist
with access to the toxin,

26:45.670 --> 26:47.240
what did he need Dempsey for?

26:47.250 --> 26:49.241
Well, we don't know, yet.

26:49.250 --> 26:52.742
But she worked for a...
She worked for a company called...

26:52.750 --> 26:56.459
Where'd it go Hichcock Pharmaceuticals.

26:57.290 --> 26:59.576
I think there's a good chance
the UnSub worked there, too.

26:59.580 --> 27:02.617
Well, let's start with people who fit the
profile who've had a recent stressor.

27:02.620 --> 27:06.283
Like anybody fired from Hichcock
in the past six months.

27:06.790 --> 27:08.781
Hichcock's a giant company, Sugar Shack.

27:08.790 --> 27:11.202
There were over 100 people fired
just this past year.

27:11.210 --> 27:13.110
And so far none of them
fit the profile?

27:13.120 --> 27:14.326
No.

27:15.290 --> 27:18.532
But I do have 30 names of people
who were downsized and shunted off

27:18.540 --> 27:21.498
to other lame companies
with a cut in pay and benefits.

27:21.500 --> 27:23.786
All right, send us the names.
We'll cross reference them

27:23.790 --> 27:26.281
with civil and criminal complaints
filed with local P.D.

27:26.290 --> 27:27.575
But I want you to keep digging.

27:27.580 --> 27:29.161
And while you're at it,
look for any connection

27:29.170 --> 27:30.740
to the First New Jersey Federal Bank.

27:30.750 --> 27:32.456
I'm on it, angel.

27:32.790 --> 27:35.497
Our guy's acting
like a workplace mass murderer.

27:35.500 --> 27:38.537
He'd stay close, seething,
and he'd plan his revenge.

27:38.540 --> 27:41.168
Well, if he is a workplace killer,
what else does that tell us about him?

27:43.380 --> 27:46.201
He's lost his empathy, his moral compass.

27:46.830 --> 27:49.879
-He's capable of anything.
-All those innocent people at the bank.

27:49.880 --> 27:51.575
They meant nothing to him.

27:51.580 --> 27:53.912
He'll take out anybody
to forward his cause.

27:53.920 --> 27:55.205
Like Dempsey?

27:55.210 --> 27:57.952
Like Dempsey and eventually, even himself.

27:57.960 --> 28:01.248
But not until he finishes taking out
his primary targets though.

28:01.250 --> 28:03.741
We have no idea
where he's going to strike next.

28:03.750 --> 28:05.536
For all we know,
he could poison a local reservoir.

28:05.540 --> 28:07.451
Well, local cops haven't gotten
any leads out of Dempsey.

28:07.460 --> 28:09.371
Why don't you go to Hichcock,
see if you have any luck.

28:09.380 --> 28:10.529
Yeah.

28:13.750 --> 28:16.321
Ms. Dempsey's boss is away for the week.

28:16.330 --> 28:17.991
I just can't believe this happened to her.

28:18.000 --> 28:22.243
Is there anyone that you can think of
who would want to hurt Ms. Dempsey?

28:22.250 --> 28:24.536
I mean anyone here at work?

28:24.540 --> 28:29.819
She wasn't the type to inspire hatred.
I mean, she was pretty quiet actually.

28:29.830 --> 28:33.209
Would you say that she was awkward,
you know, like socially?

28:33.210 --> 28:34.780
A little, yeah.

28:34.790 --> 28:39.375
She made a lot of jokes about herself.
You know, self-deprecating jokes.

28:39.960 --> 28:42.281
I always thought she'd do
a lot better dating if she didn't.

28:42.290 --> 28:46.408
-So she was single as far as you knew?
-I couldn't say one way or the other.

28:46.420 --> 28:49.378
I mean, she never really talked to me
about that kind of thing.

28:49.380 --> 28:53.498
Is there anything about her behavior
that was unusual lately?

28:53.500 --> 28:56.242
Anything that you noticed
that was out of her normal routine?

28:56.250 --> 28:58.878
Just that she was very busy
this last week.

28:58.880 --> 29:00.575
_ And there's _
a bIg corporate retreat coming up

29:00.580 --> 29:02.821
that she was helping her boss
put together.

29:02.830 --> 29:05.958
-I'm sorry I can't be of any more help.
-That's all right.

29:05.960 --> 29:07.951
I'm going to go take a look
through her things if that's okay.

29:07.960 --> 29:10.076
The police already went through
her desk, but feel free.

29:10.080 --> 29:11.240
Thanks.

29:19.080 --> 29:21.492
Gideon, some of these
layoffs were brutal.

29:21.500 --> 29:23.991
This one chemical engineer
had been at Hichcock 19 years

29:24.000 --> 29:25.536
when he was downsized.

29:25.540 --> 29:28.077
That could certainly inspire
homicidal rage. Yeah.

29:28.080 --> 29:31.243
The guy was in his late 405.
Head of his department.

29:31.540 --> 29:33.280
Definitely had
a generous severance package.

29:33.290 --> 29:34.780
All of these guys are living off pensions.

29:34.790 --> 29:38.169
They may not be happy about it,
but I don't see them killing over it.

29:43.210 --> 29:44.666
It's Garcia.

29:45.460 --> 29:47.951
Get this, Cochise.

29:47.960 --> 29:50.781
I found a chemist who works at a
company that was bought by Hichcock

29:50.790 --> 29:52.030
called Palmay Cosmetics.

29:52.040 --> 29:53.325
Now here's the thing,

29:53.330 --> 29:56.117
Lynn Dempsey applied for a loan
at New Jersey Federal Bank,

29:56.120 --> 29:58.748
around the same time this chemist
applied for a patent

29:58.750 --> 30:03.164
on this anti-ageing breakthrough
technology thing called PCO 99.

30:03.170 --> 30:05.991
So maybe he applied for a loan
in her name to make his product.

30:06.000 --> 30:08.707
That's what I thought. But both the loan
and the patent were rejected.

30:08.710 --> 30:10.996
Because Hichcock
had already applied for the patent

30:11.000 --> 30:13.286
and the patent deal had gone through,
drum roll please,

30:13.290 --> 30:14.996
New Jersey Federal Bank.

30:15.000 --> 30:18.618
I'm tracking his cell phone and it won't
be long before I have his location.

31:12.080 --> 31:14.036
Don't move.

31:15.420 --> 31:18.492
He let us take him.
He didn't kill himself.

31:18.500 --> 31:20.456
That doesn't fit the profile
of a workplace killer.

31:20.460 --> 31:22.610
Sometimes we miss the mark.

31:23.580 --> 31:25.411
Let's be glad we did.

31:25.420 --> 31:27.786
He's _our best chance
at stopping the next attack.

31:27.790 --> 31:32.534
Hill's lab had traces of botulinum toxin,
but no clues as to what he's up to next.

31:32.540 --> 31:35.202
Our only chance
is to make him tell us.

31:35.210 --> 31:36.370
You think he will?

31:36.380 --> 31:38.496
Once caught, these types usually do.

31:38.500 --> 31:40.821
They want the whole world to know
about their brilliant plan

31:40.830 --> 31:43.037
to destroy their enemies.

31:43.040 --> 31:45.417
In case he doesn't give it up,
let's play every angle.

31:45.420 --> 31:47.741
We need to re-examine everything
we know about this guy.

31:47.750 --> 31:50.617
I'll check witness reports,
forensic evidence,

31:50.620 --> 31:53.919
anything that might be a clue
to this guy's plan.

31:55.580 --> 31:58.071
A lot of lives could be at stake.

31:59.710 --> 32:03.453
You were romantically
involved with Lynn Dempsey, Mr. Hill.

32:03.460 --> 32:06.497
-Is that what she said?
-That's what her sister said.

32:06.500 --> 32:08.456
What happened to her?

32:08.460 --> 32:10.997
The fact is Lynn was already dead.

32:12.040 --> 32:13.871
That company killed her years ago.

32:13.880 --> 32:17.532
-Did they kill you, too?
-Well, they might as well have.

32:17.830 --> 32:20.162
They took everything from me.

32:20.670 --> 32:23.707
Fruits of my labour.
Best years of my life.

32:24.750 --> 32:26.786
They took my family.

32:26.790 --> 32:29.497
And when there was nothing left to take,

32:29.500 --> 32:33.789
they took two-thirds of my salary
and my health insurance.

32:33.790 --> 32:35.280
You have the opportunity

32:35.290 --> 32:37.781
to treat people with the mercy
that they never showed you.

32:37.790 --> 32:41.533
I can't even tell you
how little that means to me.

32:41.540 --> 32:44.111
What would it mean to your children?

32:48.830 --> 32:51.742
Listen. You worked hard.

32:53.080 --> 32:56.914
Played by the rules your whole life.
You don't want to go out like this.

32:56.920 --> 32:59.536
You do, you stoop to their level.

32:59.540 --> 33:04.239
There are things we can do for you.
There's ways to help you if you'll let us.

33:04.250 --> 33:06.457
We're FBI.

33:06.460 --> 33:08.030
We have influence with Justice.

33:08.040 --> 33:10.372
If you have a legitimate claim,
and I believe you do,

33:10.380 --> 33:14.498
we can see to it that you get
fair compensation and credit.

33:14.500 --> 33:16.912
And that's all you wanted, right

33:16.920 --> 33:19.377
-That's all I ever wanted.
-Of course.

33:19.380 --> 33:21.450
You don't think the company knows
they screwed you?

33:21.460 --> 33:23.325
You don't think everything they do,

33:23.330 --> 33:27.369
every move they make, isn't
designed to screw people like you?

33:31.960 --> 33:34.952
-You could really get me those things?
-Ed.

33:35.830 --> 33:38.207
This is my ABA card. I'm a lavwer.

33:38.210 --> 33:41.077
And I'm offering to take your case.

33:41.080 --> 33:43.071
And if you accept,
I have to do what you say.

33:43.080 --> 33:47.039
This whole thing is being videotaped.
I can't lie about that.

33:51.210 --> 33:55.954
I would like my sons to know
that their dad created something.

33:57.710 --> 33:59.826
I created something good.

34:04.210 --> 34:06.576
Ed. Tell us.

34:08.580 --> 34:10.286
What did you do?

34:13.880 --> 34:18.704
There's a party this afternoon
in the executive building.

34:21.460 --> 34:24.031
All the departments get together.

34:27.460 --> 34:29.530
There's a punch bowl.

34:29.540 --> 34:31.451
-Stop!
-Don't drink that! Put it down.

34:31.460 --> 34:33.280
Put it down right now.

34:33.290 --> 34:34.609
Ladies and gentleman, listen up.

34:36.040 --> 34:37.530
We are FBI.

34:38.670 --> 34:40.069
I need everybody to remain calm,

34:40.080 --> 34:42.822
but there may be some contaminated
food here that could make you sick.

34:42.830 --> 34:45.879
Please, put down whatever it is
that you're eating and drinking

34:45.880 --> 34:47.450
and please just take it easy.

34:47.460 --> 34:49.781
We're going to be coming around
asking you some questions.

34:49.790 --> 34:51.951
-Is everyone going to be okay?
-Yes.

34:51.960 --> 34:55.077
Okay, the CDC's here
with three dozen doses of antitoxin.

34:55.080 --> 34:57.412
We're going to make sure
everyone gets some just in case.

34:57.420 --> 35:01.459
Whoever may have gotten sick,
we should've caught it in time.

35:04.920 --> 35:07.787
The punch tested positive
for botulinum toxin.

35:07.790 --> 35:09.951
About a dozen of the partygoers
reported symptoms,

35:09.960 --> 35:12.110
but they've all been given the antitoxin.

35:12.120 --> 35:14.827
Thanks, JJ. I'll call you back.-Bye.

35:19.580 --> 35:21.821
-What is it?
-You're right.

35:23.380 --> 35:25.450
It doesn't make sense.

35:25.460 --> 35:28.532
I wonder, why didn't Hill take his
own life when we had him surrounded?

35:28.540 --> 35:30.576
Guys, I think we have a problem.

35:30.580 --> 35:32.070
I've been looking over the victim reports.

35:32.080 --> 35:35.868
_ _ One of the victims that was _
originally dosed was severely diabetic.

35:35.880 --> 35:37.074
And?

35:37.080 --> 35:39.571
He wouldn't have taken candy
from the candy bowl at the bank.

35:39.580 --> 35:42.287
All the victims were there. We know
that, but how are they p0isoned?

35:42.290 --> 35:45.282
I started looking at the security footage.

35:46.580 --> 35:49.458
We know Lynn Dempsey
replaced some candy from the bowl.

35:49.460 --> 35:52.372
But look how close that jar is
to the deposit envelopes.

35:52.380 --> 35:53.995
Now watch this.

35:54.880 --> 35:58.111
See that? Her hand is directly
in the stack of envelopes.

35:58.120 --> 36:00.532
So you think the envelopes
were poisoned as well as the candy?

36:00.540 --> 36:01.996
As Lynn Dempsey was dying

36:02.000 --> 36:05.822
she kept saying something like,
"The end. The end."

36:06.710 --> 36:09.918
I think what she was saying was
"the envelopes."

36:09.920 --> 36:12.161
I mean, what was it
that Hill was actually testing?

36:12.170 --> 36:14.115
The Rohypnol

36:14.920 --> 36:17.571
-The delivery system.
-Exactly.

36:17.580 --> 36:21.209
Botulinum toxin and LSD are the
only two substances in the world

36:21.210 --> 36:24.953
toxic enough to be effective in doses
as small as one-thousandths of a gram.

36:24.960 --> 36:27.076
Small enough to fit
on the glue strip of an envelope.

36:27.080 --> 36:29.787
But the CDC didn't find any evidence
of poison on the envelopes.

36:29.790 --> 36:31.371
They wouldn't have.
The envelopes were destroyed

36:31.380 --> 36:33.666
after the checks were deposited
and processed.

36:33.670 --> 36:37.492
So like the Rohypnol, Hill was using
the candy to throw us off.

36:37.500 --> 36:39.206
To cover his tracks.

36:39.210 --> 36:41.531
To distract us from the fact
that he was testing the envelopes.

36:41.540 --> 36:42.950
What I can't figure out is,

36:42.960 --> 36:46.452
why would he test the envelopes
to poison the punch?

36:47.120 --> 36:50.578
Because the punch is a decoy
just like the candy.

36:50.580 --> 36:52.286
He's not finished.

36:54.790 --> 36:56.075
Gideon.

36:59.540 --> 37:02.373
Get him down.
Get him to the ground.

37:02.380 --> 37:04.166
Get his head back.

37:12.330 --> 37:13.706
He's dead.

37:14.960 --> 37:18.032
He killed himself
before we even got to him.

37:23.540 --> 37:25.576
-Yeah?
-Hotch. It's Morgan.

37:25.580 --> 37:29.118
Listen, I'm looking at these victims
from Hichcock. This doesn't add up.

37:29.120 --> 37:32.032
All of these people are lower level.
Regular office workers.

37:32.040 --> 37:34.281
If this guy was trying to get back
at the people who screwed him,

37:34.290 --> 37:36.781
-none of them are here.
-What do you mean

37:36.790 --> 37:39.782
The entire upper management staff
is away on a corporate retreat.

37:39.790 --> 37:43.078
The office manager mentioned to Elle
that Dempsey was organizing a retreat.

37:43.080 --> 37:46.072
So then Hill wasn't using Dempsey
for access to the office party.

37:46.080 --> 37:48.662
No, he used her for access to the retreat.

37:48.670 --> 37:50.456
Where are the executives

37:50.460 --> 37:52.325
No, no. Not until tomorrow.

37:52.330 --> 37:53.820
They're out in the middle of the woods
somewhere.

37:53.830 --> 37:55.991
It's one of those
no-cell-phones—allowed type of things.

37:56.000 --> 37:57.786
And what are they doing there?

37:57.790 --> 38:01.419
You know, bonding exercises,
they play games, that kind of stuff.

38:01.420 --> 38:02.614
What kind of games?

38:03.670 --> 38:05.206
When voting
you want to think about

38:05.210 --> 38:07.075
the qualities you admire most.

38:07.080 --> 38:12.370
So, tomorrow we tally the votes
to find out who our new team leader is.

38:12.380 --> 38:14.746
Now we don't want a repeat
of last year's fiasco

38:14.750 --> 38:17.287
so this year I brought
along some envelopes.

38:17.290 --> 38:19.417
The victims need to ingest the antitoxin

38:19.420 --> 38:21.661
within four hours
from the time they were poisoned.

38:21.670 --> 38:26.243
And make sure you seal the envelopes
so there's no cheating, Fred.

38:32.170 --> 38:33.819
Does this mean
we can go fishing today?

38:33.830 --> 38:35.320
Shut up and lick it, Bob.

38:35.330 --> 38:36.661
Where are the bathrooms
around here?

38:36.670 --> 38:38.376
Bathroom?
The whole place is a bathroom.

38:38.380 --> 38:40.109
What about the phones?
I've got to call my wife.

38:40.120 --> 38:42.247
We're in the middle of nowhere.
That's the whole point.

38:42.250 --> 38:43.535
BAU to Air 1. Anything

38:43.540 --> 38:44.700
Negaﬁve.

38:44.710 --> 38:46.951
We checked the first three campsites.
Nothing.

38:46.960 --> 38:49.576
How about the Park Service?
COP: A couple of families on holiday.

38:49.580 --> 38:50.990
None saw the target.

38:51.000 --> 38:53.992
_ Wait a_ minute. _
I'm getting a radio from the Staties.

38:54.000 --> 38:56.412
They found something near
the access road and trail exit 6.

38:56.420 --> 38:58.206
EMTs are en route.

39:13.420 --> 39:15.411
These guys are in bad
shape and getting worse by the minute.

39:15.420 --> 39:16.705
Who's the sickest?

39:16.710 --> 39:17.825
Medic!

39:17.830 --> 39:20.071
He's having trouble
breathing. Hyperventilating, I think.

39:20.080 --> 39:22.878
30.

39:22.880 --> 39:25.917
I'm a Federal Agent.
You're going to be fine.

39:26.210 --> 39:28.326
He's going to make you feel 100%.

39:28.330 --> 39:30.207
Relax your breathing.

39:31.120 --> 39:33.202
You're going to be fine.

39:34.880 --> 39:36.279
Thank you.

39:47.170 --> 39:48.876
Confucius warned us,

39:48.880 --> 39:51.280
"Before you embark
on a journey of revenge,

39:52.120 --> 39:53.781
"dig two graves."

40:12.040 --> 40:13.826
You ought to sleep.

40:14.540 --> 40:16.667
Just finishing my report.

40:17.670 --> 40:19.376
Everything okay?

40:19.750 --> 40:22.241
There's always another file.

40:22.250 --> 40:24.741
-This next one's pretty bad.
-Yeah.

40:27.170 --> 40:30.788
Of all the departments,
why'd you choose the BAU?

40:32.880 --> 40:37.112
You know, I had prosecuted
dozens of murder cases

40:37.120 --> 40:41.819
and by the time they reach my desk
it always felt like it was too late.

40:42.670 --> 40:47.164
And I wanted to stop them
before they got to my desk.

40:54.880 --> 40:57.075
That doesn't really answer your question.

40:57.080 --> 40:59.116
No, it doesn't.

40:59.120 --> 41:01.111
I guess I'm still trying to figure it out.

41:07.620 --> 41:10.168
Guess I'll try and get some sleep.
