WEBVTT

00:00.333 --> 00:03.416
I gotta get goin'

00:03.416 --> 00:06.958
a friend of mine

00:08.583 --> 00:11.500
he's just Pooh Bear

00:14.208 --> 00:17.583
chasin' some honeybees

00:17.583 --> 00:21.083
I know he's out there

00:24.583 --> 00:27.958
we're so adventurous

00:27.958 --> 00:31.375
and again

00:31.375 --> 00:34.875
and there's nobody home

00:34.875 --> 00:38.291
to count on a friend

00:38.291 --> 00:41.833
Winnie the Pooh Bear

00:43.875 --> 00:45.333
take me, please?

00:45.333 --> 00:48.708
I got to be there

00:50.708 --> 00:55.958
Winnie the Pooh

01:08.291 --> 01:12.250
Pooh: Where could it be?
Where could it be?

01:12.250 --> 01:14.166
Where if it's
I haven't looked?

01:14.166 --> 01:17.416
You know,
it's really much easier

01:17.416 --> 01:20.125
losing a thing
than it is finding it.

01:20.125 --> 01:23.333
- Guess what, Pooh?
- You found it?

01:23.333 --> 01:25.583
No, I'm afraid not.

01:25.583 --> 01:27.458
For what?

01:27.458 --> 01:30.000
What I'm looking for!

01:30.000 --> 01:31.458
Oh!

01:31.458 --> 01:37.125
I'm learning to sing, Pooh.

01:37.125 --> 01:38.458
It's a hammer, Piglet.

01:38.458 --> 01:41.583
- What is?
- What I've lost.

01:41.583 --> 01:43.458
Oh, I-- Eee!

01:45.458 --> 01:47.458
Pooh, have you found my hammer?

01:47.458 --> 01:50.833
Yes, Rabbit, almost.

01:50.833 --> 01:53.333
How could you
almost find something?

01:53.333 --> 01:57.208
Well, you see,
I've looked in so many places,

01:57.208 --> 02:01.583
I'm sure it's much closer
to being found than lost.

02:01.583 --> 02:04.583
I'm never loaning you
another thing.

02:04.583 --> 02:06.000
You lose everything you touch.

02:06.000 --> 02:08.625
It's a very bothersome
habit, Pooh.

02:08.625 --> 02:12.000
And someday it's going
to get you in trouble.

02:12.000 --> 02:16.166
Oh, bother. I do have a habit
of misplacing things.

02:16.166 --> 02:18.875
Rabbit's hammer,
goldfish potato peeler.

02:18.875 --> 02:21.000
Would you like
to hear me sing, Pooh?

02:21.000 --> 02:24.083
It bothers the others
very much, Piglet.

02:24.083 --> 02:27.333
It makes them rather angry,
you know.

02:27.333 --> 02:30.208
But I haven't even started yet.

02:32.500 --> 02:36.708
Oh, dear. I had no idea.

02:36.708 --> 02:41.166
I don't like the way I'm always
displacing things, Piglet.

02:41.166 --> 02:42.500
Piglet?

02:42.500 --> 02:45.708
He was here a moment ago.

02:45.708 --> 02:48.458
Oh! I hope I haven't--

02:48.458 --> 02:50.208
No, I couldn't have.

02:50.208 --> 02:53.625
Piglet? Piglet!

02:53.625 --> 02:58.833
Oh, no, I've misplaced
my very best friend.

02:58.833 --> 03:01.125
What shall I do? What--

03:01.125 --> 03:02.875
Wait.

03:02.875 --> 03:07.708
Since I lost Piglet right
after I lost the hammer,

03:07.708 --> 03:10.583
when I find the hammer,
I find Piglet.

03:10.583 --> 03:16.083
And what better bait for
catching a hammer than nails?

03:16.083 --> 03:18.750
Well, have you found
my hammer yet?

03:18.750 --> 03:20.291
No.

03:20.291 --> 03:22.208
Not only have I not found
the hammer, Rabbit.

03:22.208 --> 03:25.458
But now I've lost Piglet
as well.

03:25.458 --> 03:28.250
It was bound to happen.
Only a matter of time.

03:28.250 --> 03:30.291
You misplace everything
you come near.

03:30.291 --> 03:33.708
Now you've misplaced Piglet.

03:33.708 --> 03:36.958
Oh, well, it'll be
all right, Pooh bear.

03:36.958 --> 03:40.500
- I'll help you find him.
- My hammer trap!

03:43.000 --> 03:46.083
Oh bother, not even close.

03:48.291 --> 03:50.458
Rabbit:
Pooh, we've looked everywhere

03:50.458 --> 03:52.833
at least a hundred times.

03:52.833 --> 03:55.125
But I believe we've
only looked over there

03:55.125 --> 03:57.291
one or three dozen times.

03:57.291 --> 03:58.958
Perhaps we should check again.

03:58.958 --> 04:00.958
This is ridiculous!

04:00.958 --> 04:04.250
We've passed the same tree
over and over.

04:04.250 --> 04:07.708
What if we split up
and looked in different places?

04:07.708 --> 04:12.958
Why Pooh,
that's almost a good idea.

04:12.958 --> 04:15.750
You look that way,
I'll look this.

04:15.750 --> 04:19.500
Then we'll meet back here
at this tree, Pooh.

04:19.500 --> 04:22.875
This tall, brown,
oak tree, Pooh.

04:22.875 --> 04:25.458
You won't get lost,
will you?

04:25.458 --> 04:27.125
I won't, Rabbit.

04:27.125 --> 04:30.000
I shall be back shortly,
if not sooner.

04:32.458 --> 04:37.000
I've done so much looking
to have found so few Piglets.

04:37.000 --> 04:41.375
But since I haven't found him,
maybe Rabbit has.

04:43.458 --> 04:44.833
Rabbit?

04:44.833 --> 04:46.875
Rabbit!

04:46.875 --> 04:49.583
Oh, my!
This is the spot!

04:49.583 --> 04:51.583
But I've lost the tree.

04:51.583 --> 04:54.833
And Rabbit, too!

04:54.833 --> 04:57.875
That Pooh Bear's
been gone forever.

04:57.875 --> 05:01.416
I'd better get Gopher
or someone to help me find him.

05:01.416 --> 05:04.708
And Piglet,
and maybe even my hammer.

05:10.458 --> 05:12.625
I do hope Tigger could help me.

05:24.833 --> 05:26.708
Certainly, Rabbit.

05:26.708 --> 05:29.625
Be glad to help you
find him.

05:29.625 --> 05:32.166
By the time I hadn't found
the hammer,

05:32.166 --> 05:34.125
I'd unfound Rabbit,

05:34.125 --> 05:37.208
which was shortly before
misplacing Piglet.

05:37.208 --> 05:41.166
Oh, no. I lost Piglet first.

05:41.166 --> 05:44.375
And then... Oh, bother.

05:44.375 --> 05:46.583
Just remember, Pooh boy,

05:46.583 --> 05:48.500
the secret to finding
the thing

05:48.500 --> 05:50.125
is knowing where it is.

05:50.125 --> 05:52.500
Let me see.

05:52.500 --> 05:55.250
Yep! Pooh and Rabbit
are lost, all right.

05:55.250 --> 05:58.583
Hmm, say, maybe
Gopher's seen them.

05:58.583 --> 06:00.708
Anybody home?

06:02.500 --> 06:05.583
Tigger, that means
I've lost Gopher, too.

06:05.583 --> 06:08.416
And I haven't even
seen him today.

06:08.416 --> 06:10.875
This is where
I misplaced Rabbit.

06:10.875 --> 06:14.416
You see,
Rabbit was standing just here,

06:14.416 --> 06:18.708
and I went over there to look
for Piglet like this.

06:18.708 --> 06:20.583
Don't worry, pal!

06:20.583 --> 06:22.458
I'll find him
before you can say--

06:22.458 --> 06:25.625
Pooh? Pooh?

06:26.958 --> 06:30.416
Oh, no, Pooh's lost me.

06:30.416 --> 06:32.958
And then I lost this tree.

06:32.958 --> 06:35.583
And-- Tigger?

06:35.583 --> 06:38.750
Don't tell me
I've lost Tigger, too.

06:40.875 --> 06:44.125
There! Out here,
I won't be bothering a soul.

06:44.125 --> 06:45.625
Lesson one.

06:45.625 --> 06:49.000
Singing is much like humming,
only louder.

06:49.000 --> 06:51.958
That sounds reasonable.

06:51.958 --> 06:54.458
I lost Rabbit
while I was losing Piglet.

06:55.958 --> 06:59.416
And Gopher was found lost
by Tigger,

06:59.416 --> 07:03.958
who is himself now lost,
because of the lost hammer.

07:03.958 --> 07:10.375
And so the logical thing
would be for me to be lost too.

07:10.375 --> 07:12.000
Then I would be where they are.

07:12.000 --> 07:14.125
I shall count to 100,

07:14.125 --> 07:17.625
just like in hide and seek.

07:17.625 --> 07:20.208
And by the time I'm done,
I'll be gone.

07:20.208 --> 07:23.000
One, two...

07:23.000 --> 07:24.458
number after two...

07:24.458 --> 07:27.166
- Can't find Pooh.
- I found you, didn't I?

07:27.166 --> 07:30.833
- We weren't lost.
- A technicality.

07:30.833 --> 07:33.208
Then who lost Pooh?

07:33.208 --> 07:35.708
Pooh got lost losing Piglet.

07:35.708 --> 07:38.083
Well, I'm lost.

07:38.083 --> 07:41.000
That's funny,
I thought you was right here.

07:41.000 --> 07:44.000
...a few large numbers,

07:44.000 --> 07:50.500
33, 36, 38--

07:50.500 --> 07:53.583
- One, two--
-

07:53.583 --> 07:56.833
I'll be with you
in just a moment, Rabbit.

07:56.833 --> 07:59.875
I'm trying to find you
and the others.

07:59.875 --> 08:03.000
43, 11...

08:03.000 --> 08:04.708
It worked!

08:04.708 --> 08:07.583
I don't know how much more
of this I can take!

08:09.875 --> 08:12.583
Well, anyway, we've found Pooh.

08:12.583 --> 08:15.000
Now only Piglet's lost.

08:15.000 --> 08:19.458
Yes, that's because I haven't
finished counting to 100 yet.

08:19.458 --> 08:21.375
That's it! That's it!

08:21.375 --> 08:23.000
I can't take it anymore!

08:23.000 --> 08:25.375
I'm losing my mind!

08:25.375 --> 08:29.000
Oh, no, not Rabbit's mind, too.

08:29.000 --> 08:31.291
I better count to 100 quickly.

08:31.291 --> 08:34.708
Hey! get a grip
on yourself, Rabbit.

08:34.708 --> 08:37.500
Yeah, this is no time
to go to pieces, long ears.

08:37.500 --> 08:40.583
We got piglets to find.

08:40.583 --> 08:42.958
Yes, of course, you're right.

08:42.958 --> 08:44.875
I'm sorry.

08:44.875 --> 08:47.958
Come on,
let's keep looking.

08:47.958 --> 08:50.208
Maybe my hammer's
somewhere out there.

08:50.208 --> 08:52.416
Fourteen...

08:52.416 --> 08:54.958
Oh, I've lost them again.

08:54.958 --> 08:56.708
Pooh, will you come on?

08:58.500 --> 09:01.375
Say! What's that?

09:01.375 --> 09:04.583
Sounds like a heffalump
with a bad head cold.

09:04.583 --> 09:06.250
Nah!

09:06.250 --> 09:08.166
It's the mating call
of the yellow-bellied,

09:08.166 --> 09:10.208
double-parked sapsucker.

09:10.208 --> 09:13.208
What if whatever it is
has Piglet?

09:13.208 --> 09:15.625
Its all my fault
for losing him.

09:17.416 --> 09:18.708
Look!

09:18.708 --> 09:22.250
Oh, d-d-dear.

09:22.250 --> 09:25.250
Piglet's much less lost
than he used to be.

09:25.250 --> 09:27.458
In fact,
I believe we've found him.

09:27.458 --> 09:30.583
- Hello, Piglet.
- Hello, Pooh.

09:30.583 --> 09:33.125
Now, that we've found you,

09:33.125 --> 09:36.291
I'm very, very sorry
for having misplaced you

09:36.291 --> 09:37.625
in the first place.

09:37.625 --> 09:39.958
Will you forgive me?

09:39.958 --> 09:43.458
I promise I shall never,
ever lose you anymore.

09:43.458 --> 09:46.416
Piglet? Piglet!

09:46.416 --> 09:48.416
Oh, I've done it again.

09:48.416 --> 09:50.583
Excuse me,
but you didn't lose me, Pooh.

09:50.583 --> 09:53.125
I came out here all by myself
to practice my singing,

09:53.125 --> 09:57.000
after you said
how it bothered everyone.

09:57.000 --> 10:01.458
Why, Piglet, you weren't
the bother. I was.

10:01.458 --> 10:04.125
Me and my habit
of losing things.

10:04.125 --> 10:05.500
Isn't that so?

10:07.375 --> 10:10.625
Yes, thank you...
I think.

10:10.625 --> 10:13.625
So, you see,
I've learned my lesson.

10:13.625 --> 10:16.000
I'm never going
to lose anything again...

10:16.000 --> 10:18.500
provided I van find it.

10:18.500 --> 10:20.875
Wait a minute!
Enough of this
lost and foundsies.

10:20.875 --> 10:23.458
Did you say
you were singing, Piglet?

10:23.458 --> 10:24.750
Yes.

10:24.750 --> 10:27.125
Yeah! I never knew you could.

10:27.125 --> 10:29.458
Yeah, actually--

10:29.458 --> 10:30.708
Why didn't you ever tell us?

10:30.708 --> 10:33.625
Yeah, go ahead
and hum a few bars.

10:33.625 --> 10:37.166
Oh, now, I don't really
sing all that wonderfully.

10:37.166 --> 10:39.000
I'm just a beginner, you know.

10:39.000 --> 10:40.458
Nonsense, Piglet!

10:40.458 --> 10:42.416
Wed love to hear you.

10:44.083 --> 10:48.000
And now, my very dear friend,
Piglet,

10:48.000 --> 10:49.708
who was misplaced by me

10:49.708 --> 10:53.333
but has since been found
and will stay found,

10:53.333 --> 10:55.000
will sing for us.

11:01.250 --> 11:04.333
You built a wonderful stage,
Pooh Bear.

11:04.333 --> 11:08.958
I assume you found my hammer
to nail it together?

11:08.958 --> 11:12.750
Well, Rabbit, I didn't
actually find the hammer.

11:12.750 --> 11:16.000
So I never actually
hammered the nails in.

11:16.000 --> 11:18.166
But don't tell anyone.

11:19.750 --> 11:21.291
Oh.

11:21.291 --> 11:23.375
Oh, dear.

11:25.125 --> 11:26.500
Oh, bother.

11:29.500 --> 11:32.708
Perhaps I'd better go look
for the hammer after all?

11:40.125 --> 11:42.375
Faster! Faster!

11:42.375 --> 11:43.958
Not too fast!

11:43.958 --> 11:45.708
Tigger: It's gonna work!

11:45.708 --> 11:47.625
It's not gonna work.

11:47.625 --> 11:49.875
I believe I've run
out of room.

11:54.875 --> 11:59.000
Christopher Robin,
what exactly is holding
the kite up?

11:59.000 --> 12:03.250
Well, nothing, Pooh.
It's just flying.

12:03.250 --> 12:04.875
I see.

12:04.875 --> 12:06.416
And how does it do that?

12:06.416 --> 12:09.166
Well, the wind tickles the kite

12:09.166 --> 12:10.708
and makes it go up.

12:12.333 --> 12:14.833
You know, if I could fly,

12:14.833 --> 12:18.000
it would be much less
of a bother getting honey.

12:39.750 --> 12:40.875
Oh, bother.

13:01.625 --> 13:04.000
Now look what you've done,
silly old bear.

13:04.000 --> 13:06.708
I'm afraid my mind
was somewhere else.

13:06.708 --> 13:10.166
I was just thinking,
you see, how I'd love to fly

13:10.166 --> 13:12.583
like your kite does,

13:12.583 --> 13:14.458
or did, Christopher Robin.

13:14.458 --> 13:16.833
You want to f-f-fly, Pooh?

13:16.833 --> 13:19.583
I've heard of butterflies
and dragonflies,

13:19.583 --> 13:21.750
but Pooh flies?

13:21.750 --> 13:24.750
Pooh--

13:24.750 --> 13:29.333
Why, bunny bear, you'd have
to give up honey for birdseed.

13:29.333 --> 13:32.458
Come on, Pooh, let's let
the kite do the flying.

13:32.458 --> 13:35.166
Eyeore: Don't see why you
shouldn't fly,

13:35.166 --> 13:37.708
but then I'm just a donkey.

13:37.708 --> 13:41.583
I know if I didn't have
high hopes once in a while,

13:41.583 --> 13:44.208
I'd be depressed all the time.

13:49.833 --> 13:53.166
Yellow seems to be the color
for things which fly,

13:53.166 --> 13:57.708
like the sun and yellow jackets
and canaries and-- and so on.

13:57.708 --> 14:00.625
A few of these might help, too.

14:00.625 --> 14:02.625
Couldn't hurt.

14:09.333 --> 14:13.000
Look like a bird to me,
Pooh.

14:13.000 --> 14:15.375
Uncanny resemblance.

14:15.375 --> 14:17.500
Almost eerie.

14:17.500 --> 14:20.333
You ought to be flying
any moment now.

14:20.333 --> 14:23.875
Oh, bother!

14:27.000 --> 14:30.750
Guess this just isn't
the moment.

14:33.000 --> 14:36.416
My, what a very lovely day.

14:36.416 --> 14:38.583
Not a cloud in the sky.

14:38.583 --> 14:41.166
- Just a... Pooh Bear?

14:43.875 --> 14:46.875
I thought I heard Rabbit
a moment ago.

14:46.875 --> 14:49.416
Thank you, Pooh Bear.

14:49.416 --> 14:51.416
My morning aren't complete

14:51.416 --> 14:55.000
without at least
one major catastrophe.

14:55.000 --> 14:58.000
It would seem, Rabbit,

14:58.000 --> 15:01.166
that the first thing
about learning to fly

15:01.166 --> 15:02.750
is learning to land.

15:02.750 --> 15:07.000
What? You're still
thinking about flying?

15:07.000 --> 15:11.625
It's unnatural and dangerous for
bears to fly.

15:11.625 --> 15:14.166
Worse than getting bounced
by Tigger.

15:14.166 --> 15:18.291
Oh, it's no that bad.

15:21.208 --> 15:25.250
And how exactly will
this help me fly, Eyeore?

15:25.250 --> 15:27.958
Eyeore:
Everybody's always sayin'

15:27.958 --> 15:30.875
what goes up must come down.

15:30.875 --> 15:34.250
With any luck,
it'll work both ways.

15:34.250 --> 15:37.583
What goes down must come up.

15:37.583 --> 15:40.125
'Course it's just a theory.

15:40.125 --> 15:43.875
Won't know for sure
till we try it out.

15:47.958 --> 15:51.583
Why, Eyeore!
I believe it's going to work!

15:51.583 --> 15:54.708
I've called
this emergency meeting

15:54.708 --> 15:59.333
because it seems Pooh Bear
has taken our joking seriously

15:59.333 --> 16:01.250
and decided to fly.

16:01.250 --> 16:04.250
But, Rabbit, Pooh can't fly.

16:04.250 --> 16:06.166
Of course he can't fly.

16:06.166 --> 16:08.000
And we have to stop him.

16:08.000 --> 16:11.125
Until the skies are free
of Poohs,

16:11.125 --> 16:13.625
none of us will be safe.

16:13.625 --> 16:16.250
Just when we're least
expecting it--

16:18.958 --> 16:21.958
Pooh really is trying to fly.

16:21.958 --> 16:24.333
I believe I would have
stayed up that time,

16:24.333 --> 16:26.333
had I not come down.

16:26.333 --> 16:29.458
Why, the whole idea
is hippoposterous!

16:29.458 --> 16:30.500
Isn't it?

16:30.500 --> 16:34.000
Of course, it is... I think.

16:34.000 --> 16:36.875
I know! We'll ask Owl!

16:36.875 --> 16:39.958
He'll know if Pooh bears
were meant to fly.

16:39.958 --> 16:44.333
You blow up a balloon,
it floats.

16:44.333 --> 16:47.166
Same thing ought to work
for bears.

16:50.500 --> 16:53.708
Oh, bother!

16:53.708 --> 16:58.000
Just don't forget to flap, Pooh.

17:01.000 --> 17:03.458
Pooh Bear is,
aerodynamically speaking,

17:03.458 --> 17:06.250
entirely unsuited for flight.

17:06.250 --> 17:08.833
Indeed,
the only way he could fly

17:08.833 --> 17:11.125
is by breaking
the law of gravity.

17:11.125 --> 17:12.625
Breaking the law?

17:12.625 --> 17:15.333
You mean Pooh
would be a criminal?

17:15.333 --> 17:17.333
Oh, dear, we have to stop him.

17:17.333 --> 17:20.708
Given the nature of updrafts
and downdrafts

17:20.708 --> 17:22.166
and cold drafts--

17:22.166 --> 17:23.625
- Oh, my.

17:28.458 --> 17:31.583
Thank you for the use
of your tail, Eyeore.

17:31.583 --> 17:33.708
Eyeore: No problem.

17:33.708 --> 17:37.000
I was getting a little tired
of it anyways.

17:37.000 --> 17:40.000
Always hanging around.

17:40.000 --> 17:43.250
Besides,
no self-respecting kite

17:43.250 --> 17:45.166
would be seen without one.

17:45.166 --> 17:47.583
Now, remember, Eyeore,

17:47.583 --> 17:50.166
you'll have to go very fast!

17:50.166 --> 17:52.875
I'll do my best.

17:55.583 --> 17:57.125
Any moment now,

17:57.125 --> 17:59.375
I shall be flying
with the birds,

17:59.375 --> 18:01.083
buzzing with the bees,

18:01.083 --> 18:02.750
soaring with the--

18:04.708 --> 18:09.208
Stop! In the name
of the law of gravity!

18:14.250 --> 18:18.083
Oh, bother!

18:21.708 --> 18:24.375
Well, at least we stopped
Pooh Bear from--

18:24.375 --> 18:26.583
Oh, my!

18:26.583 --> 18:29.250
I've done it!
I've done it!

18:29.250 --> 18:31.291
Oh, dear! He has!

18:31.291 --> 18:32.708
He has done it!

18:34.166 --> 18:36.416
he's busted the law
of gravitivity!

18:36.416 --> 18:39.166
Oh, Pooh, how could you?

18:40.583 --> 18:45.250
My very best friend,
a common criminal.

18:45.250 --> 18:48.250
There's really
only one thing to do.

18:48.250 --> 18:50.125
You've broken the law, Pooh,

18:50.125 --> 18:54.625
so I'm afraid you have
to go to your room

18:54.625 --> 18:57.083
and serve your time.

18:57.083 --> 19:01.458
Sorry, buddy bear,
but laws is laws.

19:01.458 --> 19:04.458
Perhaps after you've
finished your sentence,

19:04.458 --> 19:07.333
you will have learned
a valuable lesson.

19:07.333 --> 19:10.083
But how long will that take,
Rabbit?

19:10.083 --> 19:14.083
Oh, I should say two--
three hundred years.

19:14.083 --> 19:16.208
Look on the bright side.

19:16.208 --> 19:19.083
Maybe you'll get a couple of
decades off for good behavior.

19:19.083 --> 19:23.708
Oh, I can't leave Pooh all alone
for such a very long time.

19:23.708 --> 19:27.291
After all, he is
my best friend and,

19:27.291 --> 19:29.583
well, best friends
should stick together.

19:29.583 --> 19:31.750
You want to stay in there, too?

19:31.750 --> 19:35.000
Yes, I believe I must.

19:35.000 --> 19:37.708
Whatever you say,
Piglet, old pal.

19:37.708 --> 19:39.500
Yikes!

19:39.500 --> 19:43.500
Guess I'm as much to blame
as Pooh is.

19:43.500 --> 19:46.708
Perhaps I ought to be
in there, too.

19:46.708 --> 19:50.208
Not that anybody'd really care,
mind you.

19:53.958 --> 19:57.875
While ignorance of
the gravitational law
is no excuse,

19:57.875 --> 20:01.875
I, too, feel rather responsible
for much of what's occurred.

20:05.833 --> 20:07.708
Anybody else?

20:07.708 --> 20:11.208
Let's go, Tigger.
Oh, dear, dear, dear.

20:11.208 --> 20:13.208
It's too bad I wasn't able
to stop Pooh Bear earlier.

20:13.208 --> 20:16.000
None of this would have happened
in the first place.

20:16.000 --> 20:19.000
No! Wait, Tigger!
I didn't mean--

20:23.500 --> 20:27.458
- Pooh: Honey, anyone?
- Owl: I suppose I might.

20:27.458 --> 20:29.208
Rabbit: Do you have any tea,
Pooh Bear?

20:29.208 --> 20:32.208
Piglet:
Oh, Earl Grey, my favorite.

20:32.208 --> 20:35.458
They can't have fun without me.

20:35.458 --> 20:38.000
Why, having fun
is what tiggers do best.

20:39.375 --> 20:41.125
Pooh Bear! Piglet!

20:41.125 --> 20:43.000
Rabbit! Tigger?

20:43.000 --> 20:45.458
Pooh: Over here,
Christopher Robin.

20:46.958 --> 20:49.208
What's going on?

20:49.208 --> 20:52.000
I'm afraid that
by trying to fly

20:52.000 --> 20:55.000
I broke the law of gravity.

20:55.000 --> 20:57.375
You don't have to be
locked up for that.

20:58.708 --> 21:00.500
Free!

21:00.500 --> 21:02.708
Free at last!

21:02.708 --> 21:04.875
Pooh's flying
isn't against the law.

21:04.875 --> 21:08.708
- It's just impossible.
- It is?

21:08.708 --> 21:12.875
Well, of course bears
can fly, Pooh.

21:12.875 --> 21:16.375
But if they did,
then the bees wouldn't
have a chance,

21:16.375 --> 21:18.083
and they couldn't make honey.

21:18.083 --> 21:20.416
- No?
- No.

21:20.416 --> 21:25.500
Well, in that case, I shall
leave the skies to the bees.

21:25.500 --> 21:27.583
And speaking of bees,

21:27.583 --> 21:30.250
I believe I hear them
calling me.

21:30.250 --> 21:33.416
Pooh bears simply were
not meant to fly.

21:33.416 --> 21:35.708
Thanks for taking
buddy boy's mind

21:35.708 --> 21:37.875
off of flying,
Christopher Robin.

21:37.875 --> 21:40.291
Yes, he could have hurt himself.

21:40.291 --> 21:42.416
Or someone else.

21:50.625 --> 21:53.333
Always knew he could do it.

21:53.333 --> 21:55.875
- What was that, Eyeore?
- Said you're right.

21:55.875 --> 21:59.333
Pooh bears simply
weren't meant to fly.
