WEBVTT

00:01.551 --> 00:03.252
(Crows caw)

00:03.286 --> 00:06.038
(Exhaling) He-he-he-hoo. He-he-he-hoo.

00:06.069 --> 00:07.356
He-he-he-hoo.

00:07.390 --> 00:08.857
Sue, you're gonna pass out again.

00:08.892 --> 00:09.925
What is she doing?

00:09.959 --> 00:11.293
I found mom's old Lamaze tapes.

00:11.327 --> 00:13.647
I realized I have been psyching myself out

00:13.662 --> 00:14.585
for these driving tests.

00:14.609 --> 00:16.297
And if I can control my breathing,

00:16.332 --> 00:17.700
I can control my driving.

00:17.734 --> 00:19.601
(Exhales) He-he-he-hoo.

00:19.636 --> 00:22.004
<i>And breathe the baby out.</i>

00:22.038 --> 00:23.238
Okay. All right.

00:23.273 --> 00:26.041
I am gonna go listen to
"Fearless" by Taylor Swift

00:26.076 --> 00:27.385
one more time, and then, dad,

00:27.429 --> 00:29.306
you and I are gonna go to the B.M.V.

00:29.343 --> 00:31.208
Whoo-hoo! Go, Sue.

00:33.316 --> 00:35.250
So it's May.

00:35.506 --> 00:38.628
Yep, and she's been trying
to pass that test since March.

00:38.809 --> 00:40.155
Yeah, yeah. But there's, um,

00:40.190 --> 00:42.344
something else going on in May.

00:42.357 --> 00:45.098
Let me think. Any particular holidays?

00:45.218 --> 00:46.895
Oh, right. I knew there was something...

00:46.930 --> 00:48.257
Mother's Day.

00:48.377 --> 00:49.498
I got it, Frankie.

00:49.476 --> 00:50.910
Don't worry. I'm on it.

00:50.944 --> 00:52.445
Mike, you are so not on it.

00:52.479 --> 00:53.780
I could be on it. You don't know.

00:53.814 --> 00:55.178
Actually, I do know.

00:55.246 --> 00:56.482
'Cause you always wait
till the night before,

00:56.517 --> 00:58.456
and then you just run out to the drugstore.

00:58.475 --> 01:01.047
I'm tired of getting crappy
stuff from you guys, okay?

01:01.047 --> 01:03.699
I'm tired of making the face
and pretending to be excited.

01:03.819 --> 01:05.758
"Hey!" (Sighs)

01:06.071 --> 01:09.664
Can I please for once
just tell you what I want?

01:09.698 --> 01:10.832
It's too late, Frankie.

01:10.866 --> 01:12.884
Maybe I already got you the perfect present

01:12.891 --> 01:15.002
and hid it somewhere in the house.

01:15.537 --> 01:17.238
<i>Hey... I don't believe you.</i>

01:17.464 --> 01:19.635
Okay. Let's go.

01:19.679 --> 01:20.656
Mom, wish me luck.

01:20.776 --> 01:23.444
- Third time's the charm. Ha.
- (Mug clatters)

01:24.960 --> 01:27.307
<i>(Frankie) Turns out third
time was not the charm.</i>

01:27.338 --> 01:29.377
(Thudding) (Gasps) Oh.

01:29.551 --> 01:31.086
<i>Neither was the fourth...</i>

01:31.129 --> 01:32.744
- Train. Train. Train.
- (Crossing bells clanging)

01:32.787 --> 01:33.770
Train!

01:33.801 --> 01:34.652
(Brakes squeal) Oh!

01:34.671 --> 01:35.823
<i>Nor the fifth.</i>

01:35.858 --> 01:36.824
How am I doing?

01:36.859 --> 01:38.426
You're actually doing great.

01:38.460 --> 01:39.927
Perfect, in fact.

01:39.962 --> 01:40.995
Really?

01:41.029 --> 01:44.365
(Thuds, brakes squeak)

01:44.399 --> 01:46.067
(Shifts gears)

01:46.101 --> 01:47.315
I'll let myself out.

01:47.522 --> 01:49.336
<i>As bumpy as Sue's road was,</i>

01:49.371 --> 01:51.031
<i>Axl's was smooth as could be.</i>

01:51.050 --> 01:53.246
<i>Boss Co.'s new ask a girl to prom service</i>

01:53.252 --> 01:54.160

01:54.191 --> 01:55.324

01:55.444 --> 01:57.044

01:57.079 --> 01:58.964

01:59.747 --> 02:02.587
Yes! Yes! Oh, God, I can't believe it!

02:02.593 --> 02:03.501
Aah!

02:03.539 --> 02:04.299
Hey!

02:04.903 --> 02:06.698
This is so much better
than the break-up service.

02:06.692 --> 02:08.594
I know! I agree.

02:09.056 --> 02:12.160
$147. Bam. That's it.

02:12.178 --> 02:14.612
<i>That's enough to rent
the Orson limo for prom.</i>

02:14.625 --> 02:16.408
I rode in that when my grandma died.

02:16.442 --> 02:17.253
It was awesome.

02:17.290 --> 02:19.687
I rode the whole way to the
cemetery out the sunroof.

02:20.419 --> 02:22.176
Dude, I can't believe
you're not coming to prom.

02:22.189 --> 02:23.203
It's gonna be epic.

02:23.215 --> 02:24.629
I know. I don't know what to tell you, man.

02:24.629 --> 02:26.988
Cassidy's just not a prom kind of girl.

02:27.338 --> 02:29.220
And she's made it very
clear she doesn't want to go.

02:31.242 --> 02:33.389
It's called the Hallelujah Hoedown,

02:33.439 --> 02:35.629
subtitled "Jesus takes the reins."

02:35.749 --> 02:37.168
Reverend TimTom is running it.

02:37.180 --> 02:39.801
It's a fund-raiser for
troubled teen tattoo removal.

02:39.827 --> 02:40.747
That sounds amazing.

02:40.790 --> 02:42.235
I was thinking my mom could take us there,

02:42.222 --> 02:43.290
and your mom could pick us up.

02:43.325 --> 02:45.726
<i>Or I could drive us both ways. (Giggles)</i>

02:45.764 --> 02:47.146
I got my license today.

02:47.203 --> 02:48.579
I passed on my first try.

02:48.635 --> 02:49.611
Aha!

02:50.224 --> 02:51.782
First time? Really?

02:51.813 --> 02:53.696
- First.
- You didn't have a problem with the curb?

02:53.753 --> 02:55.536
Because the curb's tricky. (Chuckles)

02:56.718 --> 02:57.581
Huh.

02:59.329 --> 03:00.496
<i>Hey. (Book thuds)</i>

03:00.564 --> 03:02.632
So listen. Mother's Day's coming up.

03:02.666 --> 03:03.913
What's the deal? What's going on?

03:03.913 --> 03:05.082
- What do you know?
- Hmm.

03:05.202 --> 03:06.402
I don't know anything,

03:06.436 --> 03:08.237
but I'm pretty low on the
information food chain.

03:08.272 --> 03:09.738
Maybe dad already got you something.

03:09.807 --> 03:11.753
Yeah. I heard that story.

03:11.873 --> 03:12.848
Not buying it.

03:13.254 --> 03:14.931
Look, I know you're the smart one.

03:15.051 --> 03:16.145
That's why I'm coming to you.

03:16.176 --> 03:18.080
You're the only one I'm
talking to about this.

03:18.416 --> 03:21.477
Here's the deal... for once,
I just want what I want.

03:21.478 --> 03:22.801
I don't need breakfast in bed,

03:22.820 --> 03:24.803
I don't need eggs spilled
all over my comforter,

03:24.797 --> 03:26.563
I don't want a book of hug coupons,

03:26.561 --> 03:28.807
and I don't want a card written
on the back of an old receipt.

03:28.927 --> 03:31.078
I want the Backmaster 2000.

03:31.122 --> 03:33.124
It's at Brickstone. It's $40.

03:33.161 --> 03:34.600
And I want the one with the heat

03:34.588 --> 03:36.096
and the infra-red rolling balls.

03:36.152 --> 03:37.118
What do you say?

03:37.654 --> 03:39.354
(Whispers) Rolling balls.

03:39.388 --> 03:40.569
Good boy.

03:44.999 --> 03:46.161
Do you want a ride home, Sue?

03:46.195 --> 03:48.430
I can drive. We can stop for fro-yo.

03:48.464 --> 03:50.161
Or I could drive you.

03:50.179 --> 03:51.668
I got my license last week.

03:51.725 --> 03:53.969
I've had my buggy license since I was 11.

03:54.003 --> 03:55.247
No, that's okay.

03:55.256 --> 03:56.671
I'll just take the bus home with Brad.

03:56.706 --> 03:58.175
I don't wanna make him feel bad.

03:58.295 --> 03:59.374
(Car horn honks)

03:59.408 --> 04:01.643
(Singsongy) Guess who just
passed his driver's test!

04:01.677 --> 04:03.378
(Laughs)

04:03.412 --> 04:04.579
Brad...

04:04.614 --> 04:06.596
- Oh, my.
- Brad, this is sick.

04:06.614 --> 04:08.128
(Brad) I had to take
the picture five times,

04:08.147 --> 04:09.311
'cause I was smiling so much,

04:09.355 --> 04:11.856
- and you couldn't see enough of my face.
- (Laughter)

04:17.286 --> 04:19.910
<i>With all her friends getting
their driver's licenses,</i>

04:19.944 --> 04:22.399
<i>it was a pain even fro-yo couldn't cure.</i>

04:23.268 --> 04:25.277
(Mouth full) Hey, mom. Can
I talk to you for a sec?

04:25.289 --> 04:27.329
Oh, good, Sue. I wanted
to talk to you, too.

04:27.449 --> 04:29.087
Listen, Mother's Day is this weekend,

04:29.106 --> 04:31.152
and I know your dad
hasn't planned jack squat.

04:31.165 --> 04:32.403
That's why I'm coming to you.

04:32.447 --> 04:34.950
You're the girl. You're
the only one who gets it.

04:35.070 --> 04:37.909
Now I want the Backmaster
2000 from Brickstone.

04:37.934 --> 04:39.386
And I want it in yellow.

04:39.436 --> 04:41.382
It's $40, and it comes with heat

04:41.376 --> 04:42.915
and infra-red rolling balls.

04:42.928 --> 04:44.273
You got it? Good.

04:47.001 --> 04:48.190
X times 2...

04:48.209 --> 04:49.543
Excuse me, Miss Poltorak?

04:50.061 --> 04:52.088
Sorry to interrupt, but prom is coming up,

04:52.113 --> 04:53.445
and it's come to my attention

04:53.464 --> 04:54.984
that someone very special in this room

04:55.016 --> 04:55.982
has not been asked yet.

04:56.185 --> 04:58.156
Oh, I love this time of year.

04:58.163 --> 04:59.486
(Chuckles)

05:00.077 --> 05:02.317
Cassidy, will you please stand up?

05:05.758 --> 05:07.961
Maya, will you go to prom with Kevin?

05:07.967 --> 05:10.132
- Yes! Oh, my God, yes!
- Huh?

05:10.169 --> 05:12.221
(Laughs) Totally!

05:12.227 --> 05:13.010
(Pops) Aah!

05:13.710 --> 05:15.936
(Laughs)

05:16.389 --> 05:17.484
Whoo.

05:17.703 --> 05:19.404
Are you freakin' kidding me?

05:19.430 --> 05:20.856
- What?
- I can't believe this.

05:20.875 --> 05:22.239
You do realize you've now asked

05:22.245 --> 05:24.829
- every girl in this school to prom but me.
- Wait.

05:25.078 --> 05:26.444
I just didn't think you wanted to go.

05:26.456 --> 05:28.421
You know, "dances are stupid"?

05:28.541 --> 05:29.622
"School spirit's lame"?

05:29.616 --> 05:31.111
They are, and it is,

05:31.124 --> 05:33.188
but, you know, it's still my prom.

05:33.238 --> 05:35.822
I mean, what is it, Axl?
What's it gonna take?

05:35.854 --> 05:37.099
Do I need to fill out a form?

05:37.124 --> 05:38.772
Do I need to pay you? Is that it?

05:38.892 --> 05:41.260
Here. Here's 5 bucks.

05:41.472 --> 05:44.130
Actually, it's $10 this close to prom.

05:44.164 --> 05:45.565
Oh, uh, okay.

05:45.599 --> 05:46.532
(Clears throat)

05:47.252 --> 05:48.901
Uh, Cassidy?

05:48.936 --> 05:50.670
Will you go to prom with me?

05:50.704 --> 05:52.320
I don't know. I might be busy.

05:52.440 --> 05:53.615
I'm not sure I'm free.

05:53.735 --> 05:55.007
When is it again?

05:55.604 --> 05:57.900
<i>Uh, yeah. I think I will.</i>

05:57.925 --> 05:59.608
Yeah? Ha ha.

05:59.813 --> 06:00.878
Whoo!

06:00.914 --> 06:03.381
Oh, yay! (Laughs)

06:05.721 --> 06:07.154
Hey, Reverend TimTom.

06:07.185 --> 06:08.755
Well, howdy there, Sue Heck.

06:08.768 --> 06:09.788
How's it going?

06:10.000 --> 06:11.352
Not so good, actually.

06:11.472 --> 06:13.128
Can I talk to you for a sec?

06:13.322 --> 06:14.686
Pull up a hay bale.

06:19.298 --> 06:20.431
(Sighs)

06:21.250 --> 06:24.729
Well, lately, I've been having
these weird feelings inside,

06:24.741 --> 06:26.043
and I don't get it.

06:26.163 --> 06:28.922
See, all my friends have been
getting their driver's licenses,

06:28.990 --> 06:30.856
but I keep failing.

06:30.976 --> 06:33.177
And when Brad told me he got his license,

06:33.211 --> 06:34.979
instead of feeling happy for him,

06:35.013 --> 06:37.681
I just wanted to punch that
smile right off his face.

06:37.701 --> 06:39.116
So what do you think that means?

06:39.152 --> 06:39.903
Hmm.

06:40.265 --> 06:42.637
Sounds like somebody's
dancin' her first dance

06:42.662 --> 06:44.783
with that old friend
the green-eyed monster.

06:45.302 --> 06:46.516
What do you mean?

06:46.547 --> 06:48.862
You're jealous, Sue. It's
a pretty common problem.

06:49.068 --> 06:51.145
Throughout history, many
have felt its sting...

06:51.265 --> 06:53.523
Cain and Abel, Ishmael and Isaac,

06:53.548 --> 06:55.269
the Jonas brothers and 1D.

06:55.307 --> 06:57.221
You're right. What is wrong with me?

06:57.277 --> 06:58.310
I'm a monster.

06:58.341 --> 07:00.606
(Chuckles) Well, the thing is, Sue Heck...

07:01.163 --> 07:03.290
Oh. I don't have my guitar.

07:04.029 --> 07:05.636
Huh. Well,

07:05.837 --> 07:07.013
I'll just tell ya.

07:07.232 --> 07:08.947
Uh, feeling good for your friends

07:08.959 --> 07:10.755
can be tough sometimes,

07:10.755 --> 07:13.645
especially when things aren't
falling into place for you.

07:13.765 --> 07:14.946
But the thing to remember is,

07:15.002 --> 07:18.349
doesn't cost you anything to
feel good for somebody else.

07:18.812 --> 07:20.608
Oh, wow. That is so good.

07:20.620 --> 07:21.866
Hold on. I'm gonna write this down.

07:21.986 --> 07:24.037
And remember, you're not alone.

07:24.074 --> 07:25.623
I know. I have my friends.

07:25.663 --> 07:28.378
No, I'm talking about the big B.F.F.

07:28.412 --> 07:29.913
He was always right there with you,

07:29.947 --> 07:32.908
and it's okay to let him
take the wheel sometimes.

07:32.946 --> 07:36.149
Darn it. "Ridin' shotgun with the savior."

07:36.193 --> 07:38.195
It's the perfect song for this moment.

07:38.414 --> 07:41.223
Crackers and toast, where is that guitar?

07:41.530 --> 07:43.050
Would you hang out for just a sec

07:43.094 --> 07:43.860
till I find it?

07:43.894 --> 07:45.046
I don't have a license.

07:45.090 --> 07:46.347
Where am I gonna go?

07:48.518 --> 07:50.939
Oh, I can't believe it's your senior prom.

07:51.059 --> 07:52.473
You look so handsome.

07:52.504 --> 07:54.237
(Laughs) (Chuckles) Yeah.

07:54.637 --> 07:55.720
Not so fast.

07:55.726 --> 07:58.423
I want the Backmaster
2000 for Mother's Day.

07:58.429 --> 08:00.031
I'm coming to you exclusively

08:00.024 --> 08:01.514
because you're the one
everybody looks up to.

08:01.545 --> 08:03.266
You're the one who can get it done.

08:03.272 --> 08:04.480
40 bucks at Brickstone.

08:04.542 --> 08:07.064
Yellow. Infra-red rolling balls. Got it?

08:07.308 --> 08:09.454
Okay, then. Have fun.

08:09.905 --> 08:11.006
All right, come on.

08:11.043 --> 08:13.752
The rest of the school is
waiting to bask in our hotness.

08:13.783 --> 08:15.016
Let's go!

08:15.136 --> 08:16.911
Thanks for the pre-prom, Mrs. Heck.

08:16.955 --> 08:18.751
Wasn't it an awesome pre-prom, Deb?

08:18.776 --> 08:19.977
Really awesome.

08:20.015 --> 08:21.779
And happy Mother's Day.

08:21.899 --> 08:23.712
You should get a makeover or something.

08:23.769 --> 08:24.901
You look tired.

08:25.021 --> 08:26.484
Doesn't she look tired, Court?

08:26.453 --> 08:27.992
Super tired.

08:28.937 --> 08:31.082
Okay. Have fun, girls.

08:31.202 --> 08:33.730
It's all downhill from prom night. (Laughs)

08:35.409 --> 08:36.977
Where's the calendar?

08:37.011 --> 08:38.145
I don't know.

08:38.179 --> 08:39.635
Is it Mother's Day already?

08:39.756 --> 08:41.549
I thought we had another week.

08:41.582 --> 08:43.116
Here. It's...

08:43.150 --> 08:45.286
2009. Crap.

08:45.320 --> 08:47.163
Why don't we ever throw anything away?

08:47.551 --> 08:48.909
(Lowered voice) Damn it.
I already bragged to her

08:48.934 --> 08:50.824
that I got her something great,
and now I'm just gonna end up

08:50.830 --> 08:52.338
running to the drugstore at the last minute

08:52.325 --> 08:54.809
to get her some crappy
gift like I always do.

08:54.796 --> 08:56.960
Okay. Well, after that,
can we swing by Brickstone

08:56.991 --> 08:58.574
and get her the thing she really wants?

08:58.806 --> 09:00.645
- You know what she really wants?
- Yep.

09:02.666 --> 09:03.571
Nope.

09:04.136 --> 09:05.150
Nope.

09:05.620 --> 09:07.258
Uh...

09:07.315 --> 09:08.185
Nope.

09:08.360 --> 09:10.474
Damn it, Brick, you said
you knew what she wanted.

09:10.493 --> 09:12.320
Well, yes, at one point I did.

09:12.370 --> 09:14.948
But a lot of information's
come into my head since then.

09:15.068 --> 09:18.071
If this helps you, I
think it was something...

09:18.191 --> 09:19.234
"2000."

09:19.253 --> 09:21.274
Everything in here is something "2000."

09:21.394 --> 09:22.569
Come on, Brick, focus.

09:22.604 --> 09:23.776
Keyboard?

09:24.039 --> 09:27.267
Uh, radio flashlight? Radio thermometer?

09:27.305 --> 09:30.859
Radio leg shaver? Radio beer cooler?

09:30.979 --> 09:32.646
Wait a minute. How much is that?

09:32.680 --> 09:34.219
Remember that for father's day.

09:34.832 --> 09:37.684
Hmm. Now I'm questioning Brickstone.

09:37.719 --> 09:39.386
<i>(Easy listening jazz playing)</i>

09:39.420 --> 09:40.387
<i>*</i>

09:40.507 --> 09:43.240
Oh, my God, it's beautiful.

09:43.360 --> 09:45.718
Have you seriously never
been to a dance before?

09:45.756 --> 09:47.651
Well, I protested at one freshman year

09:47.658 --> 09:48.984
for gender equality.

09:49.034 --> 09:50.986
Ooh! Is that a photo booth?

09:51.918 --> 09:53.338
I'm gonna go get Courtney a water.

09:53.519 --> 09:55.077
Why are you getting Courtney a water?

09:55.121 --> 09:56.284
Because she's my date.

09:56.353 --> 09:57.911
<i>No. She's my date.</i>

09:58.031 --> 09:59.106
No, you brought Debbie.

09:59.226 --> 10:02.053
<i>Nuh-unh. I brought
Courtney. You brought Debbie.</i>

10:02.541 --> 10:04.387
Not so easy, is it?

10:04.507 --> 10:06.220
<i>*</i>

10:06.340 --> 10:08.141
(Chairs rumbling) Hey,
Sue, did your mom tell you

10:08.166 --> 10:09.974
what she wants for Mother's Day?

10:10.237 --> 10:13.205
Oh, my God. It's Mother's Day this weekend?

10:13.240 --> 10:15.005
And I didn't even remember.

10:15.041 --> 10:17.827
I have been totally going
through this selfish phase.

10:17.827 --> 10:19.385
- What is the matter with me?
- Sue...

10:19.412 --> 10:20.868
(Gasps) There I go again.

10:20.880 --> 10:22.344
Sue. Doesn't matter right now. Just...

10:22.394 --> 10:23.816
Did she tell you what she wants?

10:24.147 --> 10:24.963
Yes.

10:25.633 --> 10:27.200
Something yellow.

10:27.761 --> 10:29.538
- I think.
- Hey. Brick.

10:29.658 --> 10:30.278
Mm?

10:31.039 --> 10:32.125
Get your face out of that thing.

10:32.311 --> 10:34.102
Who knows who's been sticking what in that?

10:34.222 --> 10:34.927
<i>*</i>

10:34.961 --> 10:35.894
Go on.

10:35.929 --> 10:37.992
I really can't remember.

10:38.062 --> 10:40.215
What kind of a person doesn't remember

10:40.225 --> 10:44.259
what her own mother asked
for for Mother's Day?

10:44.544 --> 10:46.707
Wow. Reverend TimTom was right.

10:46.707 --> 10:48.609
- I am being...
- Yellow. Got it.

10:49.075 --> 10:50.336
Mm. (Snaps shut)

10:51.142 --> 10:52.298
(Sighs)

10:52.328 --> 10:53.369
<i>*</i>

10:53.414 --> 10:55.181
(Cell phone ringing)

10:55.631 --> 10:57.383
(Beep)

10:57.594 --> 10:58.382
Hello?

10:58.417 --> 10:58.995
Hey.

10:59.045 --> 11:00.502
What's your mom want for Mother's Day?

11:00.517 --> 11:01.403
How should I know?

11:01.443 --> 11:03.385
Why are you calling me at my prom, anyway?

11:03.425 --> 11:04.442
You're really crossing the line.

11:04.497 --> 11:05.518
We're gonna have a serious talk about this

11:05.563 --> 11:07.069
when I get home in two days.

11:07.314 --> 11:08.556
<i>(Clicks, dial tone)</i>

11:08.676 --> 11:09.860
All right.

11:09.895 --> 11:11.339
(Whirring)

11:11.459 --> 11:13.476
I think mom would really like this.

11:13.596 --> 11:15.347
Look, if we're getting her
something she doesn't want,

11:15.348 --> 11:16.549
we're going with the beer cooler.

11:16.599 --> 11:17.791
Wait.

11:18.470 --> 11:19.770
I think this might be it.

11:20.403 --> 11:22.936
The Backmaster 2000.

11:25.134 --> 11:27.175
Lumbar support? Are you kidding?

11:27.190 --> 11:28.193
We can't get her something medical.

11:28.191 --> 11:30.729
It'll be the inflatable
foot bath all over again.

11:31.274 --> 11:32.921
Besides, your sister said
it was somethin' yellow.

11:32.976 --> 11:34.913
- Uh, look, this comes in yellow.
- Forget it.

11:34.903 --> 11:36.885
We're not getting her some
back thing for Mother's Day.

11:36.890 --> 11:38.116
I'm not going through that again.

11:38.497 --> 11:40.043
(Exhales) You know what?

11:40.053 --> 11:41.484
I'm not going through any of it.

11:41.604 --> 11:42.760
This should be your headache.

11:42.794 --> 11:44.352
It's not my holiday. She's not my mother.

11:44.372 --> 11:45.596
My mother's dead.

11:46.104 --> 11:49.081
You kids can figure this out by yourselves.

11:49.367 --> 11:51.099
(Grunts) I'm done.

11:53.000 --> 11:59.074

12:02.315 --> 12:04.322
I can't believe I'm leaving in three weeks.

12:04.367 --> 12:06.053
Ugh. I wanna spend every minute

12:06.073 --> 12:07.715
of these next three weeks with you.

12:07.785 --> 12:10.283
No family, no friends. Just us,

12:10.403 --> 12:12.761
in a box, staring at each other.

12:12.881 --> 12:14.327
(Chuckles) I thought
you were the smart one.

12:14.362 --> 12:16.600
Summer's three months, not three weeks.

12:16.720 --> 12:18.917
No, I know, but I told you...

12:19.102 --> 12:21.645
I got accepted to that
summer program at Vassar.

12:21.956 --> 12:24.028
Yeah, but I didn't think
that was during the summer.

12:24.033 --> 12:26.286
Well, when did you think it was?

12:26.406 --> 12:28.198
I don't know. I thought it was...

12:28.318 --> 12:30.155
a course where you study summer.

12:30.150 --> 12:31.962
I mean, I remember, 'cause I thought,

12:31.992 --> 12:34.069
"man, Vassar sounds pretty easy."

12:34.707 --> 12:36.062
(Sighs)

12:36.182 --> 12:37.023
What about this?

12:37.093 --> 12:38.810
I don't know. You're on your own.

12:38.860 --> 12:40.571
Buy it, don't buy it. I don't care.

12:40.586 --> 12:41.647
I told you I'm out.

12:41.717 --> 12:42.849
Come on, dad.

12:42.924 --> 12:44.749
We both know you're not out.

12:44.783 --> 12:46.102
I'm just a kid.

12:46.172 --> 12:48.334
Am I really gonna take
the fall for a bad present?

12:48.454 --> 12:49.587
I don't think so.

12:50.036 --> 12:52.729
I can pick it, but if
I pick something lame,

12:53.192 --> 12:54.926
this thing's gonna be on you.

12:56.528 --> 12:57.864
Damn it.

12:58.745 --> 12:59.926
(Grumbles)

13:00.046 --> 13:01.299
(Cash register beeping)

13:01.333 --> 13:03.235
Hey. How about these?

13:03.402 --> 13:04.326
Pants?

13:04.371 --> 13:05.797
Yeah. She likes pants.

13:05.917 --> 13:07.044
She's always wearing 'em.

13:07.279 --> 13:08.673
That's true.

13:09.081 --> 13:10.375
And look, they come in yellow.

13:11.012 --> 13:13.510
<i>Hey, I don't think she
has any yellow pants.</i>

13:13.745 --> 13:14.876
You ever seen her in yellow pants?

13:14.926 --> 13:15.777
I haven't.

13:15.962 --> 13:18.134
And check it out. They're on sale.

13:18.209 --> 13:21.212
No way. Why would these
awesome yellow pants be on sale?

13:21.237 --> 13:22.599
This is good. She's always saying

13:22.599 --> 13:23.681
she wants something personal.

13:23.801 --> 13:25.442
How much more personal
can you get than pants?

13:25.713 --> 13:27.594
- Yeah.
- She'll never see it coming.

13:27.995 --> 13:29.216
Nailed it.

13:31.107 --> 13:32.184
Excuse me, ma'am?

13:32.794 --> 13:34.862
I'm trying to buy pants for my wife.

13:34.982 --> 13:36.168
You're close to her size.

13:36.168 --> 13:39.096
If you were a little less
wide, what size would you be?

13:42.209 --> 13:42.925
Hmm.

13:44.006 --> 13:44.922
I can't believe this.

13:44.927 --> 13:46.589
I had really big plans for us this summer.

13:46.896 --> 13:47.700
You did?

13:47.745 --> 13:50.088
Yeah. Like, well, we were gonna...

13:50.208 --> 13:51.239
go to the mall,

13:51.469 --> 13:52.811
drive around, and...

13:53.021 --> 13:53.797
go tubing.

13:53.837 --> 13:55.168
And you're just gonna throw all that away

13:55.205 --> 13:56.705
to study art with some old dude.

13:56.739 --> 13:57.840
Axl, come on.

13:57.874 --> 14:00.142
You know how much I wanna
be with you this summer.

14:00.176 --> 14:03.197
But I can't blow a chance
like this just to go tubing.

14:03.238 --> 14:05.161
(Scoffs) "Just" to go tubing?

14:05.159 --> 14:08.283
Uh, do you even understand tubing, hmm?

14:08.318 --> 14:11.331
You go down a river...
in tubes. It is awesome.

14:11.366 --> 14:14.005
We have a separate tube
just for a cooler, you know?

14:14.010 --> 14:15.611
At some point, we all link arms,

14:15.602 --> 14:17.626
- make a big wall of tubes.
- Look.

14:18.280 --> 14:20.257
This is a huge opportunity for me.

14:20.297 --> 14:22.093
But this... this is a huge tube-a-tunity.

14:23.074 --> 14:25.528
Sorry. I don't know what to say.

14:25.573 --> 14:27.720
It totally sucks, but

14:28.140 --> 14:30.137
come on. I mean, you know,

14:30.633 --> 14:32.680
it's not like we're
gonna be together anyway.

14:33.286 --> 14:34.710
<i>*</i>

14:35.368 --> 14:37.325
Whoa. What does... what does that mean?

14:38.317 --> 14:39.754
I don't know. I mean,

14:39.874 --> 14:41.816
we're gonna be in separate states...

14:42.006 --> 14:44.219
a thousand miles away from each other.

14:44.844 --> 14:46.546
We were gonna be having this conversation

14:46.546 --> 14:47.993
in three months anyway, right?

14:48.478 --> 14:50.470
We're just having it now instead.

14:50.520 --> 14:51.251
I mean,

14:51.857 --> 14:53.524
what did you think was gonna happen?

14:54.635 --> 14:56.332
I think you know me well enough to know

14:56.347 --> 14:57.703
that I don't think.

15:00.251 --> 15:03.139
But we still have the next three weeks.

15:03.519 --> 15:05.776
- Can't we just focus on that and have fun?
- (Song ends, microphone feedback whines)

15:05.786 --> 15:07.833
(Sean, amplified voice) Hey,
everybody, I'm Sean donahue,

15:07.868 --> 15:10.936
- president of the class of 2013...
- Well, why wait three weeks not to be together?

15:11.141 --> 15:13.829
If we're not gonna be together,
let's not be together now.

15:14.180 --> 15:15.346

Don't deface your body

16:51.165 --> 16:52.697
just to get back at your parents.

16:52.732 --> 16:54.635
- That ain't cool.
- (Strums chord)

16:56.196 --> 16:58.313
So, let's rap.

16:58.484 --> 17:01.928
Parents and teens don't always
see eye to eye, now do they?

17:02.048 --> 17:02.869
No way.

17:02.884 --> 17:04.471
I'm usually so close with my mom,

17:04.476 --> 17:06.387
but ever since I got my driver's license,

17:06.407 --> 17:08.896
she's like, "drive here. Drive there.

17:09.017 --> 17:10.742
Pick up your dance belt at the store."

17:10.777 --> 17:12.990
I know. It's like a license
gives you all this freedom,

17:13.055 --> 17:14.675
but in some ways, you're
kind of a prisoner.

17:14.705 --> 17:16.417
And now they got me driving grammy bottig

17:16.433 --> 17:17.268
- around on the weekends.
- (Sighs heavily)

17:17.292 --> 17:19.273
I am sorry, but I have better things to do

17:19.266 --> 17:21.233
than watching her pay for a cinnamon bun

17:21.229 --> 17:22.844
with a giant jar of pennies.

17:22.964 --> 17:25.902
Oh! Wah, wah, wah!

17:26.107 --> 17:27.964
Poor you guys!

17:28.085 --> 17:31.023
You know, is there nothing
else in life you can talk about?

17:31.073 --> 17:33.781
There are other things going
on in the world, you know.

17:33.821 --> 17:35.663
Troubled teens are getting tattoos

17:35.693 --> 17:38.195
in their... underwear area!

17:38.236 --> 17:40.553
I thought I was coming to a hoedown,

17:40.593 --> 17:42.380
but if this is just gonna
be a driver's-license down,

17:42.380 --> 17:44.622
then I guess I will just go somewhere else!

17:51.793 --> 17:52.915
(Hooves clopping)

17:53.595 --> 17:55.096
(Horse whinnies)

18:01.294 --> 18:03.060
- Whoa, Samson.
- (Blusters)

18:03.130 --> 18:04.432
Reverend TimTom.

18:04.552 --> 18:05.793
What you doing, Sue Heck?

18:05.838 --> 18:08.009
I let you down, Reverend TimTom.

18:08.043 --> 18:09.828
I tried to be happy for them,

18:09.843 --> 18:11.630
but I'm still jealous.

18:11.880 --> 18:13.446
Maybe I'm just not meant to drive.

18:13.566 --> 18:15.338
My drive to drive drove my friends away,

18:15.388 --> 18:17.595
so I am done being that driven to drive.

18:17.650 --> 18:20.327
I have decided I am not
gonna get my license.

18:21.823 --> 18:23.150
Let me ask you something.

18:23.455 --> 18:24.851
When you take a test at school,

18:24.891 --> 18:26.118
and you don't have all the answers,

18:26.123 --> 18:28.465
do you just get up and walk away?

18:28.725 --> 18:31.438
No. I would never. I
always answer what I can.

18:31.488 --> 18:33.209
I can still get partial credit.

18:33.329 --> 18:34.246
Exactly.

18:34.656 --> 18:36.308
The Sue Heck I know doesn't quit

18:36.298 --> 18:38.100
after just five tries.

18:38.220 --> 18:39.196
Now hop on.

18:39.875 --> 18:41.423
Where are we going?

18:41.543 --> 18:42.394
You'll see.

18:46.713 --> 18:48.395
- Hyah!
- (Blusters)

18:56.509 --> 18:59.087
(Horse nickers)

18:59.337 --> 19:01.362
(Telephone ringing in distance)

19:01.619 --> 19:03.164
What is this?

19:03.436 --> 19:05.804
What's going on? What are
you guys all doing here?

19:05.924 --> 19:08.241
Reverend TimTom told us you
were feeling jealous of us,

19:08.361 --> 19:09.708
and that's just crazy talk.

19:09.828 --> 19:11.570
<i>Sue, we're jealous of you.</i>

19:11.907 --> 19:13.517
- You are?
- Yeah.

19:13.637 --> 19:14.602
You're smart. You're funny.

19:14.677 --> 19:16.094
You haven't spent any time in juvie.

19:16.139 --> 19:17.881
Nobody in your family has meth teeth.

19:18.181 --> 19:20.417
Not to mention you have
the neck of a queen.

19:20.537 --> 19:21.849
Plus you always try your hardest,

19:21.889 --> 19:24.086
you're always optimistic,
and you never give up.

19:26.379 --> 19:27.845
It's true, Sue.

19:27.900 --> 19:28.686
<i>Mom?</i>

19:28.806 --> 19:30.403
What are you doing here?

19:30.692 --> 19:32.960
Brad called me and told
me it was an emergency...

19:33.080 --> 19:34.682
which it clearly is not,

19:34.802 --> 19:37.055
so thanks for scaring
the crap out of me, Brad.

19:37.235 --> 19:38.672
But the point is,

19:38.932 --> 19:40.582
we believe in you, Sue.

19:40.702 --> 19:42.045
<i>We know you can do this.</i>

19:42.065 --> 19:43.707
I know you can do this.

19:44.032 --> 19:45.338
You're right.

19:45.458 --> 19:47.376
I never give up.

19:47.809 --> 19:49.510
<i>I can do this.</i>

19:49.544 --> 19:50.845
(Keys jangle)

19:50.879 --> 19:52.611
Oh. I am gonna do this right now.

19:52.616 --> 19:53.922
(Cheering)

19:53.943 --> 19:56.120
Sixth time's the charm.

19:56.240 --> 19:57.071
Wait.

19:57.391 --> 19:58.838
This is your sixth time?

19:59.198 --> 20:00.515
Oh, I'm sorry.

20:00.635 --> 20:02.542
You can only take the test five times,

20:02.562 --> 20:04.218
then you have to wait a
month to take it again.

20:04.338 --> 20:06.271
(All groan)

20:07.696 --> 20:10.976
I just have to stay
pumped for four more weeks!

20:11.566 --> 20:12.533
Yeah!

20:12.567 --> 20:15.002
(Cheering)

20:15.036 --> 20:17.062
Aah! (Laughs) Yeah!

20:17.182 --> 20:19.504
<i>There are all kinds of tests in life.</i>

20:19.624 --> 20:21.967
Hi, Axl. Now that we're going out again,

20:22.012 --> 20:23.138
what do you wanna do tonight?

20:23.158 --> 20:25.871
We can sit outside and listen
to the flutter of the bat wings

20:25.891 --> 20:27.708
or, you know, bowling.

20:27.763 --> 20:29.655
(Thudding)

20:29.726 --> 20:31.442
<i>Some you fail over and over,</i>

20:31.472 --> 20:34.059
<i>even if you've been given the answer key.</i>

20:37.713 --> 20:39.145
Yellow pants?

20:39.825 --> 20:41.237
Are you kidding me?

20:41.567 --> 20:43.179
I told you what I wanted.

20:43.354 --> 20:45.301
<i>I told you exactly what I wanted.</i>

20:45.311 --> 20:46.568
I told all of you!

20:46.598 --> 20:48.696
Backmaster 2000!

20:53.190 --> 20:55.763
Well, hey, you haven't
even tried 'em on yet.

21:00.592 --> 21:02.058
Hey!

21:02.178 --> 21:04.542
Oh, yeah. This is so much better.

21:04.587 --> 21:06.283
Who buys someone yellow pants?

21:06.403 --> 21:08.846
Did I say pants? Did I say yellow pants?

21:08.966 --> 21:11.594
Did anybody hear me say "yellow pants"?

21:11.714 --> 21:14.468
I mean, come on. How much
clearer could a person be?

21:14.588 --> 21:16.810
You know what? Next year,
just write me a check.

21:16.930 --> 21:18.601
Hey. They're the ones in charge.

21:18.637 --> 21:20.278
- I just...
- Oh, save it, buddy.

21:20.323 --> 21:22.750
You just wait until
Father's Day. You'll see.

21:23.576 --> 21:26.084
Seriously, what am I
supposed to do with these?

21:31.735 --> 21:33.812
Oh, wow. That's not bad.

21:34.352 --> 21:36.234

21:36.354 --> 21:38.761
