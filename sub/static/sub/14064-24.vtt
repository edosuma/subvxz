00:00.320 --> 00:01.892
<i>Previously on “Boston Legal”…</i>

00:01.892 --> 00:04.081
You know why she dumped me?
Because I'm a lousy kisser.

00:04.081 --> 00:05.911
Maybe you could use some…

00:06.156 --> 00:06.930
pointers.

00:06.965 --> 00:07.976
We had sex.

00:08.010 --> 00:08.376
Yes.

00:08.377 --> 00:11.404
Mr Mkeba was only
attacking Armus in revenge.

00:11.439 --> 00:11.992
Jerry…

00:12.027 --> 00:13.649
My first trial, and I blew it!

00:13.649 --> 00:16.885
I've never been involved in a case
that was going as badly as this one.

00:16.885 --> 00:17.896
So what do we do?

00:17.896 --> 00:18.837
You could run.

00:18.838 --> 00:23.248
Do you have any evidence that
Mr Shore is hiding Mr Mkeba?

00:23.283 --> 00:23.971
Not yet.

00:24.006 --> 00:25.659
Sorry I'm late, good people.

00:25.659 --> 00:27.686
Edwin. Everything all right?

00:27.721 --> 00:29.082
Hunky-dory.

00:29.314 --> 00:30.649
Hunky-dory.

00:40.747 --> 00:41.713
Did he escape?

00:41.748 --> 00:43.675
He did not. He was released.

00:44.174 --> 00:46.840
Are we to assume that he's recovered?

00:47.332 --> 00:48.229
We are.

00:48.264 --> 00:52.704
Gentle, soothing tones, no sudden movements.
We don't want to startle him.

00:56.509 --> 01:00.466
Bonjour, Mes Amis. Edwin Poole is back.

01:00.501 --> 01:02.648
Edwin, welcome back.

01:02.683 --> 01:03.697
Shirley.

01:03.732 --> 01:04.861
Edwin.

01:04.896 --> 01:05.990
Paul.

01:06.372 --> 01:07.907
Edwin.

01:08.158 --> 01:09.940
Brad.

01:10.139 --> 01:11.305
I'm glad to see you're…

01:11.305 --> 01:12.385
Well?

01:12.420 --> 01:13.585
Well… yes.

01:13.620 --> 01:14.829
Shirley, this is for you.

01:14.829 --> 01:15.357
What is it?

01:15.357 --> 01:17.916
It's a signed, certified letter
from New Beginnings

01:17.916 --> 01:20.975
stating that I am 100%
mentally healthy.

01:21.010 --> 01:23.081
How lovely. You had it framed.

01:23.116 --> 01:26.637
That would make you the only
certifiably sane person here.

01:26.672 --> 01:29.089
Oh, my God!

01:29.805 --> 01:30.619
Edwin Poole.

01:30.654 --> 01:31.434
Denny Crane.

01:31.435 --> 01:32.372
Name on the door.

01:32.372 --> 01:33.029
Mine, too.

01:33.030 --> 01:33.910
Crane…

01:33.945 --> 01:34.790
Poole and…

01:34.791 --> 01:36.015
Schmidt!

01:36.050 --> 01:37.810
Man, you look great. Still mental?

01:37.810 --> 01:38.648
Over it. You?

01:38.683 --> 01:40.269
Never. Mad cow. Denny Crane.

01:40.269 --> 01:41.044
Edwin Poole.

01:41.079 --> 01:41.820
Crane…

01:41.821 --> 01:43.407
Poole and…

01:44.172 --> 01:45.528
Schmidt!

01:45.563 --> 01:47.290
Take a picture.

02:23.615 --> 02:27.146
So, Edwin… is the plan
to come back full-time?

02:27.181 --> 02:28.560
Big-time.

02:28.595 --> 02:30.585
I'm coming back big-time.

02:30.885 --> 02:32.664
Shirley…

02:32.905 --> 02:36.704
I must admit, during my many long
nights at the laughing academy,

02:36.704 --> 02:38.735
as I lay in bed in want…

02:38.770 --> 02:43.935
Oh, yeah… it helped to think of all
those times you and I were…

02:43.970 --> 02:45.030
carnal.

02:45.065 --> 02:46.775
We were never carnal.

02:46.810 --> 02:48.491
But it helped to think of it just the same.

02:48.491 --> 02:48.928
Edwin.

02:48.963 --> 02:50.014
I would… yeah?

02:50.086 --> 02:52.871
It's important to take things slow at first.

02:52.906 --> 02:53.667
No worries.

02:53.702 --> 02:56.883
It's not lost on me how the world
is moving too fast these days.

02:56.883 --> 03:00.709
Everyone on their PDAs,
their cell phones, competition,

03:00.744 --> 03:02.739
overworked, underpaid,
running, running, running.

03:02.739 --> 03:05.945
I was just the first one to react
to the artificial way we're living.

03:05.945 --> 03:08.553
The canary in the coalmine.

03:08.588 --> 03:10.295
The sensitive one.

03:10.634 --> 03:13.837
Um, this is Phil Mickle. He's here
to hook up your computer.

03:13.837 --> 03:17.266
Good God. Will you look
at the size of that?

03:17.675 --> 03:20.374
Phil, you remember Edwin.

03:20.409 --> 03:22.788
The sensitive one.

03:41.910 --> 03:43.520
Okay, look, I paid my taxes.

03:43.520 --> 03:45.673
So whatever this is about,
I did not do it.

03:45.673 --> 03:48.645
We're looking for Alan Shore, please.

03:50.176 --> 03:53.055
Alan. Men with guns, again.

03:53.090 --> 03:54.489
It wasn't me.

03:54.524 --> 03:55.854
What's going on?

03:55.889 --> 03:56.827
Alan Shore?

03:56.862 --> 03:57.765
It depends.

03:57.766 --> 03:59.080
You're under arrest.

03:59.115 --> 04:00.395
Arrest for what?

04:00.396 --> 04:02.018
Aiding and abetting a fugitive.

04:02.018 --> 04:06.118
Obstruction of justice and conspiracy
to aid a defendant to avoid prosecution.

04:06.118 --> 04:09.433
You just described anyone who's
ever given money to Tome Delay.

04:09.433 --> 04:11.415
Oh, please put your hands
behind your back.

04:11.415 --> 04:14.175
Do I have to? It makes me
feel so pretentious.

04:14.206 --> 04:16.962
Alan, please don't joke.
They don't… look funny.

04:16.962 --> 04:18.850
You have the right to remain silent.

04:18.850 --> 04:19.546
Must you?

04:19.547 --> 04:21.505
I'll waive reading.

04:25.316 --> 04:27.442
I… I'll get you a lawyer.

04:42.067 --> 04:44.435
Evidently, he advised a client
to flee the country.

04:44.435 --> 04:45.646
Told him to go where?

04:45.646 --> 04:46.491
Nimmo bay.

04:46.492 --> 04:47.730
The arraignment's at 10:00.

04:47.730 --> 04:48.693
Which I'll handle.

04:48.693 --> 04:49.588
Which you won't.

04:49.588 --> 04:51.034
He asked for me, Shirley.

04:51.034 --> 04:53.613
We better call the managing partners
and present this to them

04:53.613 --> 04:55.741
before they hear it on the news.

04:55.776 --> 04:57.003
But it doesn't make sense.

04:57.003 --> 04:59.432
I don't date men at the office.

04:59.467 --> 05:00.156
Stupid.

05:00.191 --> 05:01.860
Well, just the same…

05:01.861 --> 05:05.165
Look, in order for relations to be
as compatible as they were, two people…

05:05.165 --> 05:06.987
Okay, let me just stop you right there.

05:06.987 --> 05:08.933
Any man that I would be with,

05:08.968 --> 05:10.844
he would use the word “sex”.

05:10.879 --> 05:14.935
He would never say “relations,”
and certainly not to describe what we did.

05:14.935 --> 05:17.243
Come on, Brad. We were like
a couple of wild apes.

05:17.243 --> 05:20.208
Exactly. If you're so quick
to measure a man by a kiss,

05:20.208 --> 05:23.190
why not attach a little bit of weight
to his ability to intercourse?

05:23.190 --> 05:24.257
I don't want to sue.

05:24.257 --> 05:25.660
Stop making it about you.

05:25.660 --> 05:26.728
I need to sue.

05:26.763 --> 05:28.861
I need to make money for this firm.
For that I need a victim.

05:28.861 --> 05:29.897
But I'm not a victim.

05:29.897 --> 05:30.864
Of course you are, Paul.

05:30.864 --> 05:31.376
Phil…

05:31.411 --> 05:32.120
You're gigantic.

05:32.120 --> 05:36.135
Something has gone amiss here.
People simply do not grow this large.

05:36.135 --> 05:38.319
For God's sake, you need to blame somebody.

05:38.319 --> 05:40.112
This is America!

05:42.710 --> 05:47.698
42444, The Commonwealth vs Alan Shore.
Aiding and abetting…

05:47.733 --> 05:50.326
Waive reading, judge.
The charges depress me.

05:50.326 --> 05:52.993
Douglas Kupfer representing
the Commonwealth, your Honor.

05:52.993 --> 05:56.002
Well, well, well, now it all makes sense.

05:56.037 --> 05:58.970
Denny Crane for the defense.
Glad to be back, judge.

05:58.970 --> 06:00.328
What's going on here?

06:00.363 --> 06:02.784
Last week, he was in here defending you.

06:02.819 --> 06:04.917
Yes, judge. He gets me off,
I get him off.

06:04.917 --> 06:06.114
We're flamingos.

06:06.149 --> 06:06.946
Don't ask, don't tell.

06:06.946 --> 06:07.426
Silence.

06:07.443 --> 06:10.789
Your Honor, they've already started
making a farce out of this matter.

06:10.789 --> 06:13.763
You made the farce
by bringing the charges.

06:13.798 --> 06:16.737
Silence. Mr Shore, you are the defendant.

06:16.772 --> 06:19.884
I don't want to hear another poop out of you.

06:19.919 --> 06:20.876
How do you plead?

06:20.876 --> 06:23.506
Not guilty by reason of the
district attorney's insanity.

06:23.506 --> 06:25.652
All right, then. We'll schedule…

06:25.687 --> 06:28.109
that's not a real plea.

06:28.144 --> 06:29.223
Not guilty, then.

06:29.258 --> 06:30.303
Do you wish a trial?

06:30.303 --> 06:32.062
If it's not too much trouble. Speedy.

06:32.062 --> 06:34.106
The Commonwealth stands ready, your Honor.

06:34.106 --> 06:34.775
Bail?

06:34.810 --> 06:36.743
I ask to be released on my own recognizance.

06:36.743 --> 06:39.517
I assure you I will not flee.

06:39.552 --> 06:40.611
No objection.

06:40.646 --> 06:42.810
Fine. ROR is granted.

06:42.845 --> 06:46.839
We'll resume at 10:00 tomorrow.
We're adjourned.

06:46.874 --> 06:48.574
This is a happy day.

06:48.609 --> 06:52.808
Yes. People like you always bring
themselves down, Mr Shore.

06:52.843 --> 06:56.724
And just in case we don't,
we've got you.

06:59.959 --> 07:02.206
You're a diabetic?

07:02.723 --> 07:04.139
Yeah.

07:04.174 --> 07:08.032
So you are a victim.
We can sue.

07:08.067 --> 07:09.480
Brother.

07:09.752 --> 07:12.434
Congratulations.
You have a real disease.

07:12.469 --> 07:14.866
We'll file in the morning.
This is wonderful, Phil.

07:14.866 --> 07:17.334
I'm gonna make you a very rich man.

07:17.369 --> 07:19.768
Edwin, you… you can't sue a disease.

07:19.803 --> 07:23.296
But he has it, Shirley.
The man's a diabetic. I mean…

07:23.331 --> 07:27.106
But you can not file a lawsuit
against diabetes. That's a disease.

07:27.106 --> 07:28.545
It's not… But there are foundations, okay?

07:28.545 --> 07:31.350
What about the American Diabetes
Association? That's a deep pocket.

07:31.350 --> 07:32.507
We go after them.

07:32.542 --> 07:35.274
The American Diabetes Association
is trying to cure it.

07:35.274 --> 07:36.159
They don't cause it.

07:36.159 --> 07:40.846
So they'll settle out of court. Trust me.
They all pay to avoid a trial.

07:41.011 --> 07:44.015
Edwin, you seemed less crazy
with your pants down.

07:44.050 --> 07:45.615
Thank you.

07:46.157 --> 07:50.183
I don't think you're ready
to resume the practice of law.

07:50.671 --> 07:52.375
What do you mean?

07:58.461 --> 08:01.045
I have no defense, Denny.
I broke the law.

08:01.080 --> 08:02.491
So?

08:02.526 --> 08:06.220
So usually in these situations,
I go with jury nullification…

08:06.255 --> 08:09.199
persuade the jury to focus
on the moral, not the legal.

08:09.199 --> 08:11.102
But here, it makes no difference.

08:11.102 --> 08:13.822
What I did was unethical, immoral, illegal.

08:13.857 --> 08:16.220
You're being so negative.

08:17.092 --> 08:19.870
I need you to close.

08:20.143 --> 08:21.032
What do you mean?

08:21.032 --> 08:23.150
I'll try the case, but at the end,

08:23.185 --> 08:25.811
I need somebody else
to stand before the jury

08:25.811 --> 08:27.740
and say, “Let the man go”.

08:27.775 --> 08:29.634
And you want me to do that?

08:29.669 --> 08:34.549
There was a day when all you had
to do was say your name.

08:34.585 --> 08:36.004
That's still all I do.

08:36.039 --> 08:39.729
Denny… I find in life,
and I know you must,

08:39.764 --> 08:44.206
that craft doesn't matter so much
if one is a big enough star.

08:44.241 --> 08:46.405
You've spent your entire life
getting away with

08:46.405 --> 08:48.619
who and what you are
because you're a star.

08:48.619 --> 08:50.799
Big star. I blow solar flares
outta my ass.

08:50.799 --> 08:52.479
I need your star power here.

08:52.485 --> 08:55.156
I need you to stand up before
that jury when we're done,

08:55.156 --> 08:57.878
and tell them, “Let Alan Shore Go”.

08:57.913 --> 08:59.188
Really?

08:59.223 --> 09:02.752
I have a gut feeling it's my best shot.

09:08.966 --> 09:10.947
Let him go.

09:10.982 --> 09:12.928
Denny Crane.

09:14.448 --> 09:16.503
I'll do it.

09:24.013 --> 09:27.189
They have offered me two years
if I testify against you.

09:27.189 --> 09:29.431
Two years for attempted murder.

09:29.466 --> 09:33.678
–Yes
–And you took it.

09:35.365 --> 09:37.599
I have a family.
Alan… I am so sorry.

09:37.634 --> 09:39.833
That's all right, son.

09:39.868 --> 09:41.700
You look at me.

09:41.735 --> 09:44.967
–We know where your family lives.
–Denny.

09:45.739 --> 09:48.726
Mr Mkeba, you'd be insane
not to take that deal.

09:48.761 --> 09:52.003
All I can say to you is that
if you plan to tell the truth

09:52.003 --> 09:54.625
—which I think you should!—
please tell it exactly.

09:54.625 --> 09:56.335
Try not to misquote me.

09:56.514 --> 09:57.483
Because we know where you—

09:57.483 --> 09:58.427
Denny.

10:00.359 --> 10:03.833
Well, I guess we'll see you in court.

10:03.868 --> 10:05.845
I'm sorry.

10:08.710 --> 10:10.028
You should've let me break him.

10:10.028 --> 10:11.757
You were breaking me.

10:11.758 --> 10:12.375
Alan.

10:12.410 --> 10:12.992
Jerry.

10:12.993 --> 10:14.123
I'm so sorry.

10:14.158 --> 10:15.682
Don't tell me you've turned quisling.

10:15.682 --> 10:16.610
It's all my fault.

10:16.610 --> 10:19.778
If I hadn't screwed up the case,
you never would've advised him to flee.

10:19.778 --> 10:21.698
I feel so terribly responsible.

10:21.733 --> 10:24.413
Jerry, I made the decision
to do what I did here.

10:24.413 --> 10:26.620
As such, I take full responsibility.

10:26.655 --> 10:28.827
Good God, man. Nobody does that.

10:30.465 --> 10:33.050
I have done it. I have cracked the case.

10:33.085 --> 10:37.407
I'll assume, for the sake of argument,
one cannot sue diabetes.

10:37.442 --> 10:38.087
Thank you.

10:38.122 --> 10:42.509
Better to sue the cause of the disease,
the proximate cause.

10:42.544 --> 10:44.005
Now there's lawyer talk.

10:44.040 --> 10:44.461
Thank you.

10:44.461 --> 10:45.626
So I sat down with Pete last night.

10:45.626 --> 10:46.307
Phil.

10:46.308 --> 10:50.063
Right. And I went over his diet,
going way back to when he was a child.

10:50.063 --> 10:53.982
Together, we dissected his eating habits,
which… ha ha.

10:54.017 --> 10:57.902
So I think we found it.
We found the cause of his diabetes.

10:59.736 --> 11:03.479
High fructose corn syrup.
We're filing today.

11:03.514 --> 11:04.744
You're suing corn syrup.

11:04.744 --> 11:05.904
Yes, the makers of it.

11:05.904 --> 11:08.883
Do the makers of corn syrup
market directly to the public?

11:08.883 --> 11:11.043
Well, no. But I, I, I don't see how…

11:11.073 --> 11:12.394
all right.

11:12.429 --> 11:13.607
You're a partner.

11:13.642 --> 11:14.782
You're a hypocrite.

11:14.785 --> 11:16.662
You lecture me on not being able
to express my feelings.

11:16.662 --> 11:19.550
Meanwhile, you keep your bottle up
like one of Denny's kidney stones.

11:19.550 --> 11:21.715
Uh, you're touching me. That's battery.

11:21.715 --> 11:23.768
We had sex.

11:24.308 --> 11:25.612
Happy?

11:25.647 --> 11:27.484
I said the word.

11:27.718 --> 11:32.128
I am 34 years old. When I meet
a man, I think long term.

11:32.163 --> 11:34.667
“Is he potentially the father of my children?”

11:34.667 --> 11:37.499
You're not. Every now and again,
I'll think, “what the hell,”

11:37.499 --> 11:39.254
“have some fun in the short term”.

11:39.254 --> 11:40.974
But not with somebody from the office.

11:40.974 --> 11:44.019
Too messy. Too complicated.

11:44.054 --> 11:47.064
You should know better.

11:49.524 --> 11:52.503
He never told me he advised
Mr Mkeba to flee the jurisdiction.

11:52.503 --> 11:53.983
He did not. He did not.

11:54.018 --> 11:55.626
Okay, okay.

11:55.627 --> 11:57.940
Well, after Mr Mkeba did flee,

11:57.975 --> 12:00.768
did the defendant indicate
to you in any other way

12:00.768 --> 12:02.783
that he might have proffered this advice?

12:02.783 --> 12:04.552
Nope. No, no, no.

12:04.587 --> 12:09.279
Well, then can you tell us, Mr Espenson,
why after Mr Shore was arrested,

12:09.314 --> 12:12.702
did you come racing to me
to say it was all your fault

12:12.737 --> 12:16.689
that Mr Shore told the client to run?

12:17.404 --> 12:19.354
What I said was,

12:19.389 --> 12:23.375
if Mr Shore gave such advice
and I have no knowledge that he did…

12:23.410 --> 12:27.397
it was my fault since I had so totally
screwed up Mr Mkeba's trial,

12:27.397 --> 12:29.374
leaving him no option but to run.

12:29.374 --> 12:32.482
Mr Espenson, do you typically take responsibility

12:32.517 --> 12:37.708
for what others do even when you think
they haven't done it?

12:41.241 --> 12:43.564
Nothing further.

12:45.285 --> 12:48.660
Denny, not now. The closing.

12:49.586 --> 12:51.891
No questions.

12:55.053 --> 12:58.632
The truth is, we could sue
the soft drink manufacturers

12:58.667 --> 13:02.208
and the wheat and corn growers
and the makers of all those sugary cereals.

13:02.208 --> 13:06.631
We could even, perhaps, sue the federal
government for not regulating these foods…

13:06.631 --> 13:07.992
Did you know about this?

13:07.992 --> 13:09.177
Of course not.

13:09.178 --> 13:12.800
We need to contact his doctor,
find out what the hell is going on.

13:12.800 --> 13:16.388
Start with L'il Jimmey's Yum Dingers
because this is what Bob…

13:16.388 --> 13:16.783
Phil.

13:16.818 --> 13:19.585
Phil Mickle grew up eating
more than anything else.

13:19.585 --> 13:20.725
My client has been…

13:20.758 --> 13:21.862
He's suing a snack cake?

13:21.862 --> 13:24.616
…consuming three packages
of these delicious treats

13:24.616 --> 13:27.004
every day of his life
since he was 5 years old.

13:27.004 --> 13:33.365
And we are going to prove that
they are as deadly as cigarettes.

13:33.524 --> 13:34.979
Did you see that turnout?

13:34.979 --> 13:37.035
It'll be on every network news tonight.

13:37.035 --> 13:39.100
Edwin Poole is back. You know what?

13:39.100 --> 13:41.095
It's a niche, Shirley. I can feel it.

13:41.095 --> 13:43.974
I'm gonna be the lawyer
who brings down big sugar.

13:43.974 --> 13:44.533
Edwin.

13:44.568 --> 13:45.093
Yeah?

13:45.094 --> 13:45.842
Have a seat.

13:45.877 --> 13:47.020
Okay.

13:51.387 --> 13:53.179
Edwin.

13:53.214 --> 13:55.948
You just sued the Lillian Corporation.

13:55.983 --> 13:57.544
And it feels good.

13:57.579 --> 14:00.314
You called their snack cakes poison,
deadlier than cigarettes.

14:00.314 --> 14:01.256
I stand behind it.

14:01.256 --> 14:03.937
They could sue you, Edwin, and us.

14:03.972 --> 14:05.070
Oh, stop it.

14:05.105 --> 14:07.527
Don't be silly. I have qualified immunity.

14:07.527 --> 14:09.852
Only for what you say in court.

14:09.887 --> 14:13.100
That immunity does not extend
to press conferences, Edwin.

14:13.100 --> 14:18.969
You just accused the world's largest vertically
integrated conglomerate of selling poison.

14:19.004 --> 14:25.139
And you did it in your capacity
as a lawyer of this law firm.

14:37.852 --> 14:39.312
They brought a motion to dismiss,

14:39.312 --> 14:41.664
and they've counterclaimed for defamation.

14:41.664 --> 14:43.100
Now we're the target.

14:43.135 --> 14:44.769
They didn't waste any time.

14:44.804 --> 14:46.886
They're also deposing Phil this morning.

14:46.886 --> 14:48.076
What about notice?

14:48.111 --> 14:51.257
I waived it in the hopes of getting them
in the room today.

14:51.257 --> 14:53.584
If we agree to dismiss Phil's claim,

14:53.619 --> 14:56.170
maybe I can get them to drop
the suit against us.

14:56.170 --> 14:58.540
And this whole thing will go away.

14:58.575 --> 15:00.875
Now how do we get Edwin to go away?

15:00.910 --> 15:05.137
Let's just deal with this case first,
then we'll turn to Edwin.

15:08.742 --> 15:12.705
Mr Shore informed me
that we would lose the trial,

15:12.740 --> 15:14.882
and that I would be convicted.

15:14.917 --> 15:15.756
Of attempted murder?

15:15.756 --> 15:17.024
Yes.

15:17.025 --> 15:19.820
What else did Mr Shore say, Mr Mkeba?

15:19.855 --> 15:23.742
He told me that perhaps my only option
at avoiding prison was to run,

15:23.742 --> 15:27.396
but as a member of the bar,
he could not advise me to do so.

15:27.431 --> 15:29.917
Now you interpreted Mr Shore's statement

15:29.952 --> 15:32.101
to mean that you should flee the jurisdiction?

15:32.101 --> 15:33.108
Objection. Leading.

15:33.108 --> 15:33.861
Sustained.

15:33.862 --> 15:36.757
How did you interpret
Mr Shore's statement?

15:36.792 --> 15:39.672
And I would remind you,
sir, you are under oath.

15:40.075 --> 15:45.314
I guess I felt that if he were
in my shoes, he would run.

15:45.349 --> 15:50.519
But as a lawyer, he was not allowed
to advise me to do so.

15:50.554 --> 15:55.426
Yes, and as a result of this communication
with Mr Shore, what did you do?

15:55.461 --> 15:56.516
I fled to Canada.

15:56.551 --> 15:58.336
You were captured and brought back?

15:58.336 --> 15:59.555
Yes.

16:00.803 --> 16:02.764
Thank you, sir.

16:04.963 --> 16:08.162
Denny, not until the close.

16:09.280 --> 16:13.051
So, Mr Mkeba, as I understand it,

16:13.086 --> 16:17.618
I specifically told you
I could not advise you to run?

16:17.653 --> 16:19.424
That's correct.

16:19.459 --> 16:21.195
Nothing further.

16:21.607 --> 16:23.296
Mr Kupfer?

16:23.331 --> 16:26.213
The prosecution rests, your Honor.

16:26.248 --> 16:29.131
The witness is excused.

16:31.342 --> 16:34.924
Your Honor, at this time, the defense
moves for a directed verdict of not guilty.

16:34.924 --> 16:36.911
The prosecution has failed to make a case.

16:36.911 --> 16:37.628
Denied.

16:37.629 --> 16:40.773
Fine, then we'd like to call our first witness.

16:40.808 --> 16:43.917
Ladies and gentlemen… ADA Douglas Kupfer.

16:43.952 --> 16:45.964
You can't call him.

16:45.999 --> 16:47.787
It's not unprecedented, your Honor,

16:47.787 --> 16:50.865
especially when defense goes to bias.
The only reason I'm on trial…

16:50.865 --> 16:51.778
Objection.

16:51.813 --> 16:52.692
Sustained.

16:52.693 --> 16:57.478
Mr Shore, the court instructed you not to poop.

16:57.513 --> 16:59.953
Sidebar, judge.

17:05.946 --> 17:07.960
The only reason I'm on trial is him.

17:07.960 --> 17:10.263
I should be allowed
to cross-examine him on motive.

17:10.263 --> 17:14.967
My courtroom will not be turned
into a sideshow. I told you…

17:15.002 --> 17:17.490
Your Honor, I have no problem testifying.

17:17.525 --> 17:21.445
In fact, since Mr Shore rang
the bias bell in front of the jury,

17:21.481 --> 17:23.468
I'd appreciate the chance
to refute the attack.

17:23.468 --> 17:26.488
It is highly unorthodox—

17:26.522 --> 17:29.802
Yes, but as Mr Shore pointed out,
not unprecedented.

17:29.837 --> 17:35.416
Your Honor, let's just do this.
Let the, uh, defendant take his shot.

17:37.850 --> 17:39.150
Ah…

17:39.788 --> 17:42.876
I think if we agree to withdraw the case

17:42.911 --> 17:44.802
now before generating massive attorney fees…

17:44.802 --> 17:48.452
It's a little late to be singing
“Let's call the whole thing off,” Ms Schmidt.

17:48.452 --> 17:51.876
Your colleague declared us to be
poison manufacturers to the whole world.

17:51.876 --> 17:53.774
Which he regrets.

17:53.809 --> 17:55.959
I do. It was all my idea.

17:55.994 --> 17:58.753
Yes, well, if only contrition
could make us whole.

17:58.753 --> 18:01.478
We have assembled to conduct
Mr Mickle's deposition.

18:01.478 --> 18:02.666
You waived notice. I see…

18:02.666 --> 18:05.870
Look, if this goes forward, it will only
bring more publicity to an idea that…

18:05.870 --> 18:08.344
Mr Mickle is not the first
overweight person

18:08.344 --> 18:10.784
to pin the responsibility
for his obesity on us.

18:10.784 --> 18:12.626
We look at it as test case.

18:12.661 --> 18:17.581
Now, should we proceed with the deposition,
or should we take a break for a snack?

18:23.179 --> 18:25.867
Let's dismiss and then pay court costs.

18:25.902 --> 18:26.983
I don't want to settle.

18:26.983 --> 18:28.801
Phil, if they go after you for defamation…

18:28.801 --> 18:30.813
They already are.

18:31.117 --> 18:33.896
The fight is on.

18:38.052 --> 18:40.022
So how would you describe me
to your friends?

18:40.022 --> 18:41.775
I'm curious.

18:41.810 --> 18:45.675
I really don't see what difference
that would make.

18:45.710 --> 18:46.875
I'd like to know.

18:46.910 --> 18:47.695
Brad.

18:47.730 --> 18:49.041
I'd like to know, please.

18:49.041 --> 18:51.043
Okay. Well, um…

18:51.078 --> 18:54.025
I guess I would describe you as, uh…

18:54.740 --> 18:56.493
Buzz Light-year.

18:56.528 --> 18:57.997
You thing I'm Buzz Lightyear?

18:57.997 --> 18:59.647
You're very military.

18:59.682 --> 19:04.561
Brad, my idea of how to wind down
after a tough day is to pour a glass of wine,

19:04.596 --> 19:08.316
light a candle and get into a hot
bubble bath with my partner.

19:08.350 --> 19:10.656
Can you ever see yourself doing that?

19:10.691 --> 19:13.481
Well, it's just alcohol
and extreme temperatures.

19:13.481 --> 19:15.753
We're complete opposites.

19:15.788 --> 19:17.990
You know that. Come on.

19:18.025 --> 19:21.801
You haven't the slightest idea of who I am.

19:28.952 --> 19:32.600
I'm not saying I got fat
only because of L'il Jimmey's.

19:32.635 --> 19:36.248
I ate the bad cereals, soda pops,
brownies, cookies.

19:36.283 --> 19:38.394
I've had a sweet tooth since I was 2.

19:38.394 --> 19:41.047
Yes, but L'il Jimmey's is the only one
that you're suing.

19:41.047 --> 19:42.540
Well, I was addicted to them.

19:42.540 --> 19:44.812
You know, whenever I had sugar low

19:44.847 --> 19:47.663
or I was feeling depressed, uh,
I'd eat… eat a box of them.

19:47.663 --> 19:51.379
And that's what caused your diabetes?

19:51.414 --> 19:52.467
She's a skinny.

19:52.502 --> 19:53.101
Phil.

19:53.102 --> 19:56.049
No, I… I know the way
skinnies think of fat people.

19:56.049 --> 19:58.962
And diabetics, like lung cancer
victims and smokers,

19:58.962 --> 20:00.824
“We did it to ourselves,” right?

20:00.824 --> 20:03.045
Well, I didn't eat three boxes a day.

20:03.080 --> 20:05.560
Did you read the labels
on those boxes, Mr Mickle?

20:05.560 --> 20:08.283
Did you see the calorie count?
Were you able to perform basic math?

20:08.283 --> 20:10.063
I was addicted, thin mint.

20:10.098 --> 20:10.759
All right.

20:10.760 --> 20:13.094
Let the record reflect
that he called me food.

20:13.094 --> 20:14.143
A cookie, no less.

20:14.143 --> 20:15.201
Ms Marino, you've been rude.

20:15.201 --> 20:17.584
And I might also point out that
we are not the first people

20:17.584 --> 20:19.546
to connect junk food with diabetes.

20:19.546 --> 20:22.522
Did a medical professional
ever connect your diabetes,

20:22.522 --> 20:25.068
specifically, to L'il Jimmey's snack cakes?

20:25.068 --> 20:27.988
Well, m, my doctor said my intake
of sugar was too high and…

20:27.988 --> 20:30.294
But did he connect specifically your diabetes…

20:30.294 --> 20:33.573
Yes! He knew I was eating box
after box of L'il Jimmey's,

20:33.573 --> 20:35.732
and he told me to stop, but I was addicted.

20:35.732 --> 20:39.326
Did he use the word “addicted,”
or is that yours?

20:39.361 --> 20:40.040
It's mine.

20:40.075 --> 20:41.660
Did he ever say, “eat less”?

20:41.660 --> 20:43.747
Objection! Rudeness.

20:43.782 --> 20:45.800
What? You can answer.

20:45.835 --> 20:48.133
And when you claim
our product poisoned you,

20:48.133 --> 20:51.045
do you have any evidence of that?

20:51.080 --> 20:54.647
Do you talk dismissive like that
to everybody, or just me?

20:54.682 --> 20:58.243
I wasn't in a dismissive mood when you tried
to wiggle out of this lawsuit, was I?

20:58.243 --> 20:59.770
You know what, Vivian?

20:59.805 --> 21:02.237
You're starting to piss me off.

21:02.272 --> 21:03.831
Your client sued us.

21:03.866 --> 21:06.385
What'd you think, I was gonna
come in here all sugar and spice?

21:06.385 --> 21:09.017
Oh, well, perhaps
you would've liked that.

21:09.052 --> 21:11.664
Consider my willingness
to drop this case revoked,

21:11.664 --> 21:14.315
you skinny little bitch.

21:17.985 --> 21:19.448
You were wonderful, Shirley.

21:19.448 --> 21:21.999
No, I'm serious. You were brilliant.
My God, it was…

21:21.999 --> 21:23.376
What's the word? You, uh…

21:23.376 --> 21:25.696
Escalated a situation
I was hoping to quash?

21:25.696 --> 21:26.982
That's it.

21:27.609 --> 21:28.711
Edwin.

21:28.746 --> 21:31.144
Do you have any medical or scientific research

21:31.144 --> 21:33.164
to back the claims laid out in your complaint?

21:33.164 --> 21:35.150
Not a shred, but we're just getting started.

21:35.150 --> 21:36.204
We'll do that research,

21:36.204 --> 21:39.131
you and I, burning the midnight oil
like the old days, huh?

21:39.131 --> 21:41.493
You may not get an opportunity to do research,

21:41.493 --> 21:45.329
if the claim is dismissed tomorrow, which,
at the moment, seems extremely likely.

21:45.329 --> 21:46.266
Tosh.

21:46.301 --> 21:50.379
Edwin, have you prepared anything
for the hearing?

21:50.414 --> 21:52.685
Not a thing.

21:54.012 --> 21:57.104
Okay, then, I'll… I'll have
to prepare something myself.

21:57.104 --> 21:57.618
Yes!

21:57.653 --> 21:59.943
Uh, and… and, Edwin.

21:59.944 --> 22:03.850
I'll need you to leave me alone
so that I can concentrate.

22:03.885 --> 22:04.875
Yes.

22:04.910 --> 22:06.150
And, Edwin.

22:06.185 --> 22:11.674
What I really need is for you
not to sue anyone else.

22:11.709 --> 22:13.322
Yes.

22:14.033 --> 22:16.545
You can do it, Shirley. I know you can.

22:17.216 --> 22:19.288
Thank you.

22:26.331 --> 22:27.898
You're thinking.

22:27.933 --> 22:30.703
There was a day I used to do that.

22:32.802 --> 22:35.743
I'm thinking this may be a mistake,
putting Kupfer on the stand.

22:35.743 --> 22:38.649
It gives him the opportunity to put
prior bad acts in evidence,

22:38.649 --> 22:40.982
which is obviously
why he so readily agreed.

22:40.982 --> 22:43.101
If he does that, he gives you
grounds for a mistrial.

22:43.101 --> 22:44.687
Not if I've opened the door.

22:44.687 --> 22:46.347
I've gotta be very careful, Denny.

22:46.347 --> 22:47.938
I could end up sinking myself here,

22:47.938 --> 22:51.338
which, I have a feeling,
he knows all too well.

22:51.664 --> 22:54.889
Maybe we should just rest.
His case is thin.

22:54.924 --> 22:57.405
But possibly enough.

22:57.625 --> 23:00.154
And if I lose, never mind jail.

23:00.189 --> 23:04.115
These are felony charges.
My law career would be over.

23:04.332 --> 23:05.950
And that never used to bother me.

23:05.950 --> 23:09.179
Well, it bothers you because as
you get older, your priorities change.

23:09.179 --> 23:11.082
You begin to realize…

23:11.117 --> 23:15.323
what really matters… money.

23:16.603 --> 23:18.610
I've never seen you look so nervous.

23:18.610 --> 23:20.800
Well, except for night terrors and the clowns

23:20.800 --> 23:23.649
and the girl and the word salad.

23:23.684 --> 23:27.154
I've never kidded myself.
I've always known how it would end for me.

23:27.154 --> 23:29.805
I'm just not ready for it yet.

23:29.840 --> 23:34.277
But what you keep forgetting is,
at the end of the day,

23:34.312 --> 23:36.579
you always have me.

23:54.707 --> 23:57.403
I'm into rock climbing,
competitive biking.

23:57.438 --> 24:00.821
I want a woman who can keep up
with me both physically

24:00.856 --> 24:04.239
as well as intellectually
and who is also incredibly hot.

24:04.239 --> 24:05.549
That's who I am.

24:05.584 --> 24:07.875
I've given it some thought,
and you're right.

24:07.875 --> 24:10.661
There's no romantic future between us,
I value our friendship.

24:10.661 --> 24:12.266
I don't want to screw that up.

24:12.266 --> 24:15.766
So if you're okay with going back
to the way things were, so am I.

24:15.766 --> 24:16.874
Just friends?

24:16.909 --> 24:17.983
Just friends.

24:27.299 --> 24:32.164
Conspiracy to aid a defendant
to avoid prosecution.

24:32.199 --> 24:34.399
Isn't that a defense lawyer's job?

24:34.434 --> 24:35.940
Within the bounds of the law.

24:35.940 --> 24:38.766
Okay, but certainly,
if I were to advise a client,

24:38.766 --> 24:41.558
do not tell the police the truth,
that would be okay?

24:41.558 --> 24:44.227
But if you advised him to lie,
it would not.

24:44.262 --> 24:45.922
And you took it a step further.

24:45.922 --> 24:50.160
You advised your client to jump bail,
to flee the jurisdiction.

24:50.195 --> 24:52.265
No, I told him it was his only option.

24:52.265 --> 24:53.046
Same thing.

24:53.081 --> 24:54.083
No, but come on,

24:54.084 --> 24:55.869
if the client comes to me and says,

24:55.869 --> 24:57.659
“Gee, as I look at things,”

24:57.694 --> 25:00.768
“it seems my only real shot
at avoiding prison is to run,”

25:00.768 --> 25:06.071
and it happens to be true, I have
a legal obligation to lie to my client,
to disagree?

25:06.106 --> 25:06.594
No, but…

25:06.629 --> 25:09.210
And yet if I agree, I've committed a crime?

25:09.211 --> 25:13.827
If that agreement can be construed
as advising him to flee, yes, it's a crime,

25:13.827 --> 25:16.703
and by the way, your client didn't
come to you and lay it all out.

25:16.703 --> 25:19.574
You laid it out to him,
which crosses the line.

25:19.609 --> 25:24.115
I expressly told him I was not
allowed to advise him to flee.

25:24.150 --> 25:28.339
While conveying to him all the while
that that is exactly what he should do.

25:28.339 --> 25:30.649
But I'm a kidder. You know that.

25:30.684 --> 25:34.729
I offered you $10,000 to drop this, did I not?

25:34.764 --> 25:38.775
Yes, as either a transparent attempt to entrap me

25:38.810 --> 25:41.386
or a demented plan to have me recused.

25:41.421 --> 25:44.075
The point is, you didn't take me seriously.

25:44.110 --> 25:46.694
But you claim I was serious
with Mr Mkeba.

25:46.729 --> 25:49.686
You seem to know this beyond
all reasonable doubt, in fact,

25:49.686 --> 25:51.347
which, given you weren't even there…

25:51.347 --> 25:52.939
Do you think that you're fooling anybody?

25:52.939 --> 25:55.418
Do you, Mr Kupfer?
This is a personal grudge.

25:55.418 --> 25:56.984
No, it isn't. However much I…

25:56.984 --> 25:58.482
It's becoming jibber-jabber.

25:58.482 --> 26:03.176
Did you not say in judge Thompson's
courtroom two weeks ago

26:03.211 --> 26:05.140
that you would like to see me suffer?

26:05.140 --> 26:05.612
No.

26:05.613 --> 26:09.271
You said your only fear was
that someone would stab me

26:09.306 --> 26:11.806
before you would get
the chance to take me down.

26:11.806 --> 26:16.142
Is it your testimony to this jury
that you do not hold a grudge against me?

26:16.142 --> 26:18.463
It's my testimony that
that grudge is not in play.

26:18.463 --> 26:19.444
It's not in play?

26:19.444 --> 26:20.356
No, it is not.

26:20.357 --> 26:22.543
Admittedly, I do not like you.

26:22.578 --> 26:24.047
It makes me happy
to be prosecuting you…

26:24.047 --> 26:25.809
You despise me.

26:25.844 --> 26:27.533
All right.

26:27.568 --> 26:29.222
Tell us why.

26:30.237 --> 26:32.403
Oh, you would love
for me to tell you why.

26:32.403 --> 26:34.499
That would be grounds for a mistrial. No.

26:34.499 --> 26:38.086
My grudge makes this prosecution
a little more thrilling,

26:38.121 --> 26:40.742
but you're on trial
because you broke the law.

26:40.742 --> 26:42.566
Objection. Calls for a legal ruling.

26:42.566 --> 26:43.022
Sustained.

26:43.022 --> 26:46.148
You advised a client accused
of attempted murder to flee.

26:46.148 --> 26:47.051
That's a crime.

26:47.086 --> 26:47.538
Objection.

26:47.538 --> 26:47.922
Sustained.

26:47.922 --> 26:49.662
Perhaps you'd like to take the stand now,

26:49.662 --> 26:53.067
put your character in issue?

26:53.288 --> 26:58.472
My client trusted me to tell him the truth,
which trust I honored.

26:58.507 --> 27:01.414
That's my character, Mr Kupfer.

27:08.971 --> 27:11.759
Well, they calendared the meeting
for later on this afternoon.

27:11.759 --> 27:14.528
No, I know it's bogus.

27:18.932 --> 27:20.882
But I could be there
in about a half-hour.

27:20.882 --> 27:23.919
I love it when he goes to court.

27:37.819 --> 27:42.287
No doctor or medical professional
has ever linked his diabetes

27:42.322 --> 27:44.300
to L'il Jimmey's snack cakes.

27:44.335 --> 27:46.255
And even if they could, so what?

27:46.278 --> 27:48.525
All the information Mr Mickle
needed to make

27:48.525 --> 27:52.157
his informed dietary decision
was right there on the label.

27:52.192 --> 27:55.824
My God, when are people going
to start taking responsibility?

27:55.824 --> 27:58.685
This man snorted down three boxes a day,

27:58.720 --> 28:01.248
not to mention the soft drinks
and the potato chips.

28:01.248 --> 28:04.468
The only exercise he got was reaching
for the cookie jar, and he wants to blame us?

28:04.468 --> 28:07.109
Then what? We outlaw desserts altogether,

28:07.144 --> 28:08.917
we criminalize the cupcake

28:08.952 --> 28:12.001
because people cannot be expected
to eat in moderation?

28:12.001 --> 28:13.634
It's ridiculous.

28:13.669 --> 28:17.964
Mr Mickle wants to be able to snack and sue.

28:17.999 --> 28:21.520
He wants to have his cake and eat it,
too, and enough is enough.

28:21.520 --> 28:25.382
That's one word this plaintiff
can't seem to appreciate…

28:25.577 --> 28:27.390
“Enough”.

28:34.215 --> 28:37.243
“Yellow dye tartrazine,”
which is a coal tar derivative,

28:37.243 --> 28:41.401
“Blue dye triphenylmethane,”
which is a petroleum based product.

28:41.436 --> 28:45.522
“Red dye carminic acid,” which is derived
from the carcasses of the cochineal beetle.

28:45.522 --> 28:48.343
I'm sorry. Did you say… the cochineal beetle?

28:48.378 --> 28:50.050
Carcasses, that's right.

28:50.085 --> 28:53.625
“Partially hydrogenated vegetable
or animal shortening,”

28:53.660 --> 28:55.897
Which is beef fat, pork gelatin,

28:55.932 --> 28:59.111
which is made from boiled bones,
tendons and skin of pigs.

28:59.111 --> 29:04.632
Uh, so far, we're up to motor oil,
bugs, road tar and pig bones.

29:04.667 --> 29:06.267
So far she hasn't named a thing

29:06.267 --> 29:09.534
that isn't in the majority
of cookies and snack cakes.

29:09.569 --> 29:11.099
And isn't that scary?

29:11.134 --> 29:14.142
No, what's scary is that
we're being singled out.

29:14.177 --> 29:17.151
Yes, it has us all terrified.
May I continue?

29:17.186 --> 29:18.763
“Bleached white flour”…

29:18.798 --> 29:22.161
the common ingredient used
to bleach flour is chloride oxide,

29:22.161 --> 29:25.490
the use of which has been linked
to destruction of the pancreas

29:25.490 --> 29:28.197
and a form of type 2 diabetes.

29:28.232 --> 29:32.482
And finally, the biggie,
“high-fructose corn syrup”.

29:32.517 --> 29:36.392
This product does not metabolize
as a normal sugar in the body,

29:36.427 --> 29:40.302
and it prevents a certain hormone, leptin,
from reaching the brain.

29:40.302 --> 29:43.089
This hormone normally sends
a signal to the brain that

29:43.089 --> 29:45.807
your stomach is full
and tells you to stop eating,

29:45.807 --> 29:49.352
but whenever you eat anything
with high-fructose corn syrup,

29:49.352 --> 29:55.539
your brain thinks it's not full, and so
you keep eating and eating and eating.

29:55.574 --> 29:58.762
This product, like many dessert cakes,

29:58.797 --> 30:03.248
is addictive and causes diabetes,
and that is what this lawsuit will show.

30:03.283 --> 30:07.487
As for defense counsel's remark
that the whole thing is ridiculous,

30:07.522 --> 30:08.785
is it?

30:08.820 --> 30:13.958
The rate of diabetes has increased
80% in the last decade.

30:13.993 --> 30:17.828
Nearly 21 million Americans have diabetes.

30:17.863 --> 30:21.568
One in three children
will get it in their lifetime.

30:21.603 --> 30:25.274
I just want to say that again,
one in three children.

30:25.309 --> 30:27.450
These companies are corporate drug dealers

30:27.450 --> 30:29.697
their products are killing our children.

30:29.697 --> 30:31.910
Objection. This is beyond inflammatory.

30:31.910 --> 30:34.633
Is it? One in three children?

30:34.668 --> 30:36.483
You market to children.

30:36.518 --> 30:42.296
At least tobacco companies say on the
packages that cigarettes can kill you.

30:42.331 --> 30:48.074
And you have the temerity to accuse
my client of not taking responsibility?

31:04.811 --> 31:09.948
He effectively counseled his client
to skip trial and run.

31:09.983 --> 31:12.717
Now he prefaced this by saying

31:12.752 --> 31:16.767
he was not legally permitted
to give such advice, but come on.

31:16.802 --> 31:20.782
He gave it all the same.
And the client did, in fact, flee.

31:20.817 --> 31:24.854
Now do I have a grudge
against the defendant?

31:24.889 --> 31:26.671
Yes, I do.

31:26.706 --> 31:29.094
But as I said in that witness chair,

31:29.129 --> 31:32.808
we are not here today
because of my hard feelings.

31:32.843 --> 31:36.487
We are here because
Alan Shore broke the law…

31:36.522 --> 31:40.054
A law he is not above,

31:40.089 --> 31:43.246
a law that the 12 of you…

31:43.281 --> 31:46.404
took an oath to uphold.

31:56.843 --> 31:58.493
Denny.

31:58.775 --> 32:00.451
It's the closing.

32:00.486 --> 32:03.726
This would be the time to talk.

32:07.676 --> 32:10.470
Pregnant pause, man.

32:19.588 --> 32:20.959
Who the hell are we kidding?

32:20.959 --> 32:23.313
Defense attorneys make their living

32:23.348 --> 32:26.022
helping their clients get away with murder.

32:26.057 --> 32:29.586
We put rapists back on the street,
knowing they're gonna rape again.

32:29.586 --> 32:32.052
Let's not pretend we don't aid and abet crime.

32:32.052 --> 32:35.431
The key is, make sure we cover our asses.

32:35.466 --> 32:38.810
Attorneys do that better than anybody.

32:38.845 --> 32:41.384
Now, uh, Alan Shore covered his.

32:41.419 --> 32:44.506
He knew he couldn't legally
advise Mr Mkeba to run,

32:44.541 --> 32:47.593
and he expressly said
he couldn't give him such advice.

32:47.593 --> 32:54.438
Did Mr Mkeba get the message
anyway? Sure. But technically,

32:54.473 --> 32:57.325
Alan Shore didn't break the law.

32:57.360 --> 32:59.087
Ass covered, over and out.

32:59.122 --> 33:00.764
Not guilty. Simple as that.

33:00.799 --> 33:02.441
Oh, and here's another thing…

33:02.441 --> 33:05.200
about asses.

33:05.235 --> 33:07.497
Not you. We'll get
to you in a second.

33:07.497 --> 33:10.884
If you have too much success
against the DA's office, and…

33:10.884 --> 33:14.099
and Alan Shore has had a lot,
especially against this sputz
—beats him every time!

33:14.099 --> 33:14.958
Objection.

33:14.993 --> 33:15.818
Sustained.

33:15.819 --> 33:17.504
Mr Crane…

33:17.539 --> 33:19.606
I'm sorry, your Honor.

33:19.778 --> 33:22.884
Too much success, eventually,

33:22.919 --> 33:27.282
you get a giant bull's eye
painted on your bottom.

33:28.014 --> 33:29.244
Objection.

33:29.279 --> 33:31.435
Sustained. Mr Crane!

33:31.436 --> 33:33.604
I'm just trying to make
a point, your Honor.

33:33.604 --> 33:35.193
Alan Shore was a target.

33:35.228 --> 33:38.831
He's got a bigger bull's eye
on his ass than I have on mine,

33:39.011 --> 33:42.550
and this man, Douglas Kupfer, is aiming for it.

33:42.585 --> 33:45.236
Said he wanted to stab him.
That's subtle.

33:45.271 --> 33:46.455
This is a vendetta.

33:46.490 --> 33:49.180
He wants my client any way
he can get him.

33:49.215 --> 33:51.300
That's the only reason we're here.
Over and out.

33:51.300 --> 33:54.044
Reasonable doubt. You all know that.

33:54.468 --> 33:57.550
Last name, Crane. First name, Denny.

33:57.725 --> 33:59.344
Not guilty.

33:59.640 --> 34:02.028
Over and out.

34:13.699 --> 34:16.043
I've read the complaint.

34:16.492 --> 34:21.018
I can see no detailed evidence which
would allow me to hold the defendant liable.

34:21.018 --> 34:25.465
Nor can I conclude these charges
cannot be established during discovery.

34:25.500 --> 34:28.351
The emerging research today
is increasingly indicating

34:28.351 --> 34:31.003
that the major cause of disease and death

34:31.038 --> 34:34.007
in the United States is our national food supply.

34:34.043 --> 34:37.306
The defendant's motion to dismiss
is therefore denied.

34:37.341 --> 34:41.213
We'll confer and set a trial date.
Adjourned.

34:42.914 --> 34:44.279
You did it, Shirley.

34:44.313 --> 34:45.974
So the fight's on?

34:46.009 --> 34:47.634
The fight is on.

34:50.322 --> 34:52.786
If you dismiss the claim
of your own accord,

34:52.786 --> 34:55.216
we will agree to withdraw
our defamation suit.

34:55.216 --> 34:56.643
How sweet.

34:56.679 --> 34:59.462
We'll dismiss for a number
with a lot of zeroes in it, Ms Marino,

34:59.462 --> 35:00.993
otherwise, we have a trial.

35:00.993 --> 35:02.912
I covet trials.

35:02.947 --> 35:05.025
As do I.

35:06.204 --> 35:09.181
I'm thinking class action.
We should start rounding up fatties.

35:09.181 --> 35:10.514
What are your thoughts?

35:10.514 --> 35:14.902
Edwin, my thought is,
let's get you back in the hospital.

35:14.937 --> 35:16.234
That's a put down.

35:16.269 --> 35:18.009
You're not stable yet, Edwin.

35:18.031 --> 35:21.594
Unless you want your name to come
off the door permanently,
it's back in the hospital.

35:21.594 --> 35:24.023
I'm not kidding.

35:45.145 --> 35:46.502
Hey.

35:48.094 --> 35:49.497
Hey.

35:49.917 --> 35:51.638
What's up?

35:52.466 --> 35:53.800
Nothing.

35:53.835 --> 35:56.957
Just wandering.

35:57.427 --> 35:59.291
You want this?

35:59.326 --> 36:00.445
Sure.

36:00.480 --> 36:02.293
You don't want it?

36:02.328 --> 36:04.106
I've already had two.

36:06.767 --> 36:08.288
Thanks.

36:11.227 --> 36:16.033
I really liked what you said earlier,
and you could say it, because,

36:16.068 --> 36:18.048
um, we can be honest with each other, you know,

36:18.048 --> 36:21.629
the way… the way friends should be.

36:22.408 --> 36:24.268
Cool.

36:24.303 --> 36:30.023
It's funny, 'cause I've been talking
to some of my girlfriends, and um…

36:30.058 --> 36:34.221
it turns out there's a lot
of different kinds of friends.

36:34.256 --> 36:38.374
Like my friend Alyssa has a friend that, um,

36:38.409 --> 36:41.236
she goes to museums with.

36:41.271 --> 36:44.064
That's it. Just museums.

36:45.689 --> 36:47.571
Do you want to go
to a museum with me?

36:47.571 --> 36:50.614
No. God, no.

36:50.915 --> 36:54.379
I have another friend, uh, Melanie…

36:57.285 --> 37:00.620
she, uh… she has a friend, this guy,

37:00.655 --> 37:04.667
and they have an understanding. It's, um…

37:04.858 --> 37:08.067
it's called friends with benefits.

37:10.311 --> 37:11.408
You've heard of it.

37:11.408 --> 37:13.736
Uh, friends with benefits, yes.

37:14.242 --> 37:17.495
But maybe it's not
what you're talking about.

37:17.530 --> 37:20.240
Actually, you should just tell me.

37:20.275 --> 37:23.397
Well, we would, um…

37:23.432 --> 37:28.636
As friends do, help each other out when…

37:28.671 --> 37:30.759
in need.

37:30.794 --> 37:32.848
Need of?

37:33.700 --> 37:35.930
Intercourse.

37:35.965 --> 37:37.274
Which would be the…

37:37.309 --> 37:39.030
Benefit.

37:40.364 --> 37:45.982
I have never had
that kind of friend before.

37:46.721 --> 37:50.080
But I have to admit,
I can imagine circumstances

37:50.115 --> 37:53.082
where that would be beneficial.

37:56.566 --> 37:57.912
Great.

37:58.932 --> 38:00.870
Great.

38:04.638 --> 38:07.697
So when do these benefits kick in?

38:07.732 --> 38:10.477
Tonight too soon?

38:40.473 --> 38:45.003
Ms Foreperson, has the jury reached
a unanimous verdict?

38:45.038 --> 38:46.181
We have, your Honor.

38:46.181 --> 38:47.871
What say you?

38:48.549 --> 38:52.393
“On the matter of the Commonwealth
of Massachusetts vs Alan Shore,”

38:52.393 --> 38:56.028
“we the jury find the defendant Alan Shore”

38:56.063 --> 38:58.259
“not guilty of all charges”.

38:58.294 --> 39:01.654
This concludes the jury's service
as well as this trial.

39:01.679 --> 39:05.028
You are dismissed
with the thanks of this court.

39:05.063 --> 39:06.431
Mr Shore, you are free to go.

39:06.431 --> 39:08.185
Thank you.

39:11.748 --> 39:13.408
What a nail biter.

39:13.443 --> 39:18.032
Mr Shore, one day I hope
to speak at your funeral.

39:22.435 --> 39:24.153
Thank you, Denny.

39:24.339 --> 39:26.568
You pulled it out of…

39:26.603 --> 39:28.797
well, your ass, I guess.

39:28.832 --> 39:30.357
Scotch.

39:30.392 --> 39:31.882
Indeed.

39:35.702 --> 39:39.381
I was lucky. If Javert hadn't decided
to prosecute me himself…

39:39.381 --> 39:41.469
Nah. The case was too thin.

39:41.504 --> 39:44.144
The simple truth is,
you did cover yourself.

39:44.179 --> 39:47.276
They never would've got you,
not beyond reasonable doubt.

39:47.276 --> 39:50.138
I was lucky I had you.

39:50.173 --> 39:52.907
Still undefeated. Never lost, never will.

39:52.942 --> 39:56.015
It was a deft touch the underwear.

39:56.050 --> 39:58.274
All's well that ends well.

39:58.903 --> 40:02.877
Two years of jail time didn't exactly
end well for Mr Mkeba.

40:02.912 --> 40:05.698
Well, he nearly beat a man to death.

40:05.733 --> 40:09.533
He deserves to go to jail.
People need to take responsibility.

40:09.568 --> 40:11.047
Hell, that's what you did, right?

40:11.047 --> 40:12.158
No, in the end.

40:12.159 --> 40:14.715
I didn't have to take responsibility
for my actions.

40:14.715 --> 40:16.671
I'm drinking scotch on the balcony.

40:16.671 --> 40:19.208
Hey, I bared myself in open court for you.

40:19.243 --> 40:21.986
If you haven't got the decency
to celebrate your own victory,

40:21.986 --> 40:25.219
celebrate mine, for God's sakes.

40:25.641 --> 40:27.051
To triumph.

40:27.086 --> 40:28.427
And to me…

40:28.462 --> 40:30.670
King of the world.

40:32.716 --> 40:35.308
Are we setting a bad example?

40:35.343 --> 40:36.631
I shoot people.

40:36.666 --> 40:37.920
I bribe them.

40:37.921 --> 40:38.700
We drink.

40:38.735 --> 40:39.480
Smoke.

40:39.481 --> 40:40.494
I'm unfaithful.

40:40.529 --> 40:41.529
Not to me.

40:41.530 --> 40:43.375
Never to you.

40:43.410 --> 40:45.861
We're not setting examples, Denny.

40:45.896 --> 40:48.313
We're just being true to who we are.

40:49.423 --> 40:51.409
Who are we?

40:51.833 --> 40:53.236
Denny Crane.

40:53.271 --> 40:54.648
Alan Shore.

40:54.683 --> 40:55.991
Leaders of men.

40:56.026 --> 40:58.885
With bull's eyes on our asses.
