WEBVTT

00:00.902 --> 00:03.107
You are not the first
of your kind to arrive.

00:03.108 --> 00:05.009
We call them the Sun
and the Moon.

00:05.076 --> 00:05.773
She was here.

00:05.798 --> 00:09.057
Your mother and the Book
of Leaves saved my life.

00:09.114 --> 00:12.683
Every painful moment is
part of God's plan.

00:12.751 --> 00:14.418
Then make me a full
partner in your plan.

00:14.486 --> 00:19.256
The sword of Osman Gazi,
founder of the Ottoman Empire.

00:19.324 --> 00:21.258
I am taking it with me.

00:21.326 --> 00:23.427
Get the horses. We're
going to Constantinople.

00:23.495 --> 00:25.295
<i>A bastard and woman,</i>
<i>what a partnership.</i>

00:25.363 --> 00:26.864
Now I must consider
what to do with those

00:26.931 --> 00:29.466
no longer supporting
my leadership.

00:29.534 --> 00:30.734
Da Vinci must live.

00:30.802 --> 00:34.271
Without him you cannot
enter the Vault of Heaven.

00:34.339 --> 00:37.508
The Book of Leaves cannot be removed
from the Vault of Heaven.

00:37.575 --> 00:39.476
Why would the book
still be in the vault?

00:39.544 --> 00:42.279
When my mother left,
wouldn't she have taken it with her?

00:42.347 --> 00:46.183
I said she went in the vault.
I never said she left it.

You can't trust him, Leo.

02:19.277 --> 02:22.813
<i>Wherever Riario goes,</i>
<i>the corpses follow.</i>

02:22.881 --> 02:24.648
<i>He's ready to kill for</i>
<i>the Book of Leaves.</i>

02:27.819 --> 02:29.887
But he's ready to die
for it as well.

02:31.156 --> 02:32.789
Now more than ever.

02:34.192 --> 02:35.712
<i>What happened to you</i>
<i>in the altar room?</i>

02:37.996 --> 02:39.563
What did you see?

02:51.342 --> 02:54.444
We need to go home, Zo.

02:56.881 --> 02:59.016
We need to get
what we came for.

03:04.355 --> 03:05.989
Amen.

03:11.362 --> 03:14.598
The time has come,
Leonardo.

03:14.666 --> 03:17.968
You and I shall enter
the Vault of Heaven at long last.

03:18.036 --> 03:20.204
And what of me?

03:20.271 --> 03:24.575
You assisted in the ritual
and I am very thankful.

03:24.642 --> 03:27.311
But the vault is to be entered
by the Sun and the Moon.

03:27.378 --> 03:31.682
I am as deserving
as you both.

03:31.749 --> 03:33.951
Yet not as trustworthy.

03:34.018 --> 03:35.385
Very true.

03:36.921 --> 03:40.857
Are he and I
really so different?

03:40.925 --> 03:42.159
Tell me, what do you
believe keeps him

03:42.227 --> 03:43.588
from stealing the book
for himself?

03:43.595 --> 03:46.029
My life has always been
about sharing knowledge.

03:55.540 --> 03:59.643
Since you war
among yourselves,

03:59.711 --> 04:01.612
you will all enter
the vault together.

04:03.114 --> 04:06.350
It appears our fates
are tied, artista.

04:11.055 --> 04:13.657
Up ahead is
the Vault of Heaven.

04:13.725 --> 04:15.534
The Sun and the Moon
entered it many years ago

04:15.559 --> 04:16.990
and were never seen again.

04:17.728 --> 04:19.161
The Sun and the Moon?

04:19.230 --> 04:22.799
The Abyssinian and my mother.
Your mother?

04:22.867 --> 04:25.028
Maestro, you can't expect her
to still be in the vault.

04:28.873 --> 04:31.074
Your friends doubt
the power of the Book of Leaves.

04:31.142 --> 04:33.043
I'll stop doubting when
I see the fucking thing.

05:05.209 --> 05:08.178
With all the heaviness
outside these walls,

05:08.246 --> 05:10.013
I cannot tell you
how I appreciate

05:10.081 --> 05:12.849
the lightness
you've brought me.

05:12.917 --> 05:14.484
Lightness?

05:17.322 --> 05:19.990
Pleasure.

05:20.058 --> 05:23.860
If my time as a missionary has
taught me anything,

05:23.928 --> 05:29.666
it's that pleasure usually comes
at a steep price.

05:29.734 --> 05:33.804
And what price do you
imagine me paying?

05:33.871 --> 05:35.305
You'll be fine.

05:37.575 --> 05:40.977
If anyone pays
for any of this,

05:41.045 --> 05:43.080
it will be me.

05:44.749 --> 05:48.118
You've proven your worth
to this family.

05:48.186 --> 05:51.722
None would dare
lay a hand on you.

05:51.789 --> 05:53.690
It's not my body
I worry for.

05:57.228 --> 06:01.932
I wonder about
the bond between us.

06:01.999 --> 06:04.134
And how it will endure.

06:04.202 --> 06:07.237
I do care about you

06:07.305 --> 06:10.407
but I also have
a reputation to maintain.

06:22.153 --> 06:24.788
As does your husband.

06:24.856 --> 06:28.058
As did my father, Cosimo.

06:28.126 --> 06:31.294
My whole life

06:31.362 --> 06:35.932
I have suffered under the weight
of reputation.

06:37.368 --> 06:39.736
As far back
as I can remember

06:39.804 --> 06:41.705
I've been the bastard
waiting in the wings.

06:46.577 --> 06:50.213
Reputation...

06:50.281 --> 06:51.748
What a luxury.

06:51.816 --> 06:53.049
<i>Carlo.</i>

06:57.255 --> 06:58.188
Carlo!

07:02.760 --> 07:05.128
Guards! Help us!

07:23.247 --> 07:24.281
Vanessa.

07:58.916 --> 08:00.517
He came in
through the roof.

08:00.585 --> 08:01.885
Bring the physic.

08:01.953 --> 08:04.888
We must ensure no harm
has come to Giuliano's child.

08:04.956 --> 08:07.424
Or the girl herself. Come.

08:12.063 --> 08:13.430
!
Come.

08:46.764 --> 08:49.966
The gods created different thresholds
with deadly challenges

08:50.034 --> 08:51.201
to guard the Vault of Heaven.

08:53.237 --> 08:55.805
This is the first.

09:03.714 --> 09:05.882
Are those people?
Some are children.

09:05.950 --> 09:10.453
Anything heavier than a young child
and this happens.

09:26.771 --> 09:29.172
You could have just
told us, of course.

09:29.240 --> 09:31.841
In order to open
this first threshold,

09:31.909 --> 09:35.178
you must pay tribute
according to the legend.

09:35.246 --> 09:38.014
You must place a hand
to that centre stone.

09:38.082 --> 09:42.052
It is located at the height of
one and a half men.

09:42.119 --> 09:45.121
The vault will know if we send forth
anything heavier than a child

09:45.189 --> 09:48.858
who's seen five cycles
of the sun.

09:48.926 --> 09:51.194
A weight-sensitive path.
30 paces to clear.

09:51.262 --> 09:54.331
Nothing heavier
than a child.

09:54.398 --> 09:55.765
<i>Throw a spear at it.</i>

09:55.833 --> 09:58.802
How many years do you think
we've been at this problem?

09:58.869 --> 10:00.770
Maybe you just need
a bigger spear.

10:12.583 --> 10:14.484
I've missed this part.

10:18.322 --> 10:20.757
A well-planned attack.

10:20.825 --> 10:24.027
They intended to end
the Medici line, every last one of us.

10:24.095 --> 10:26.062
We took these items
from the assassins.

10:26.130 --> 10:27.797
Captain.

10:27.865 --> 10:30.146
I was under the impression you
were competent in your roll

10:30.201 --> 10:31.768
as protector
of the palace.

10:31.836 --> 10:34.070
The entrances
were secured.

10:34.138 --> 10:35.939
They leapt
from adjoining rooftops.

10:36.007 --> 10:37.240
Perhaps I should
inform Lorenzo

10:37.308 --> 10:39.943
how difficult it is
for you to keep intruders

10:40.011 --> 10:40.977
from climbing
into windows.

10:41.045 --> 10:44.147
His windows.

10:44.215 --> 10:46.750
And his bedrooms.

10:46.817 --> 10:49.653
Consider your station.

10:49.720 --> 10:51.788
Consider yours.

10:52.923 --> 10:55.258
<i>Who were they, Captain?</i>

10:55.326 --> 10:56.860
They possessed an intimate
knowledge of the palace.

10:56.927 --> 10:58.595
Knowing exactly
where to strike.

10:58.663 --> 11:02.098
Excommunication has created many enemies,
some within our own walls.

11:02.166 --> 11:04.167
These men
weren't Florentine.

11:06.904 --> 11:10.507
They were sent here by
Duke Federico of Urbino.

11:38.636 --> 11:40.370
Perfection.

11:41.739 --> 11:44.641
It's impressive to see your
people craft the gears

11:44.709 --> 11:47.510
and devices
I need so quickly.

11:47.578 --> 11:50.046
I have a whole empire
at my command.

11:53.284 --> 11:54.851
The metasoma, Nico...

11:54.919 --> 11:57.887
Mm?
The tailpiece.

12:05.629 --> 12:08.298
Quickly.

12:08.365 --> 12:11.267
Gently, gently. Gently.

12:12.169 --> 12:14.104
Would you move? Thank you.

12:16.774 --> 12:19.743
Now that and this
should...

12:22.279 --> 12:24.114
Good, good, good.

12:24.181 --> 12:25.849
Now lower it.

12:28.586 --> 12:31.755
And so, gentlemen,
and Priestess.

12:32.590 --> 12:34.057
I give you the Scorpion.

12:43.000 --> 12:44.801
They don't think
it looks like much.

12:44.869 --> 12:48.772
This is the world's first
self-propelled cart.

12:48.839 --> 12:50.507
This little toy
had better work.

12:50.574 --> 12:52.041
Of course it will work.
Just...

12:53.911 --> 12:57.781
I wind this dial, which contracts
the strings that will turn these gears

12:57.848 --> 13:01.151
and urge the cart onwards.

13:07.024 --> 13:08.858
Shall we begin?

13:27.511 --> 13:28.778
It seems to
be light enough.

13:28.846 --> 13:31.948
Lucky thing, or you'd have been
the next best alternative.

13:50.634 --> 13:52.635
Come on, come on.

13:59.276 --> 14:00.844
That's it.

14:29.907 --> 14:32.242
Well done, my Dreamer.

14:33.244 --> 14:36.479
The Book of Leaves
is our salvation.

14:36.547 --> 14:37.747
It will be.

15:05.442 --> 15:07.510
This is how you know
he's a Count.

15:07.578 --> 15:11.347
You do all the work,
he takes all the glory.

16:13.177 --> 16:14.677
Watch your step.

16:31.695 --> 16:34.764
Let's pretend
we heard it land.

18:10.761 --> 18:14.464
Bayezid
of the House of Osman,

18:14.531 --> 18:17.066
and ir to
the Ottoman Empire.

18:17.134 --> 18:19.602
I speak to you on
behalf of Pope Sixtus,

18:19.670 --> 18:22.305
Bishop of Rome and head
of the Christian Church.

18:24.708 --> 18:26.242
Interesting.

18:43.026 --> 18:45.561
You should have
an attendant doing that.

18:45.629 --> 18:48.764
I'm fine on my own,
really.

18:48.832 --> 18:51.934
It's not whether you're competent to
brush your own hair.

18:52.002 --> 18:55.905
One receives as much
respect as one demands.

18:55.973 --> 18:59.108
I myself had to learn this
lesson when I was younger.

18:59.176 --> 19:02.245
By allowing
yourself to be waited upon,

19:02.312 --> 19:06.949
you establish
how vital it is

19:07.017 --> 19:11.053
for people
to follow your word.

19:11.121 --> 19:13.756
It's not something they
taught me in the convent.

19:13.824 --> 19:16.229
I suspect if you think back,

19:16.254 --> 19:18.572
the Mother Abbess
had her prerogatives.

19:20.731 --> 19:25.001
Moses reports no ill-effects from
the attack we endured.

19:25.068 --> 19:26.068
True?

19:26.136 --> 19:28.504
I feel fine.

19:28.572 --> 19:33.442
And the baby feels fine.

19:33.510 --> 19:36.045
But...

19:36.113 --> 19:38.214
But...

19:39.850 --> 19:41.817
you keep me
in the palace

19:41.885 --> 19:45.021
and you claim it's
for my own safety.

19:45.088 --> 19:46.923
But I almost
lost my life.

19:46.990 --> 19:50.993
My child's life.

19:51.061 --> 19:53.596
You made me
a target here.

19:53.664 --> 19:58.100
The Medicis' enemies will follow
that child wherever he goes.

19:59.937 --> 20:02.471
It is not I who make you
a target but you

20:02.539 --> 20:06.142
and the man
you chose to bed.

20:06.210 --> 20:10.046
The man I chose to bed

20:10.113 --> 20:14.050
will not define me.

20:14.117 --> 20:18.521
One receives as much
respect as one demands.

20:28.932 --> 20:32.268
I see you've
renewed your studies.

20:37.241 --> 20:41.043
The Book of Leaves,
Your Highness.

20:41.111 --> 20:44.413
Its mysteries demand
our attention.

20:44.481 --> 20:46.983
Its mysteries
have already seduced

20:47.050 --> 20:50.920
my own nephew away
from perfect obedience.

20:50.988 --> 20:53.990
So...

20:54.057 --> 20:58.828
what justifies
this waste of your time?

21:00.130 --> 21:04.100
These sigils come
from the ancient East.

21:04.167 --> 21:07.937
They tell no story
as far as I can make out,

21:08.005 --> 21:13.442
but they seem to
speak of joy.

21:15.445 --> 21:18.681
Of rage.

21:18.749 --> 21:20.983
And of sorrow.

21:21.051 --> 21:24.420
The only rage that should
concern you is mine.

21:31.395 --> 21:34.330
While I spend my days
designing a holy war

21:34.398 --> 21:37.166
against our enemies,
Cardinal,

21:37.234 --> 21:43.105
you renew your interest
in a distraction.

21:43.173 --> 21:47.343
My hope is that the book
may offer some assistance

21:47.411 --> 21:51.881
in this conflict between
our warring nations.

21:51.948 --> 21:55.017
The assistance I need,
Cardinal,

21:55.085 --> 21:58.954
will come from the loyal
subjects who surround me.

21:59.022 --> 22:02.892
Not from superstitious old men who are
spiraling into madness.

22:08.432 --> 22:13.703
False idols will appear
from all around us.

22:17.040 --> 22:20.743
But the sin is not
in their existence.

22:24.281 --> 22:27.583
The sin

22:27.651 --> 22:30.453
is in their worship.

22:38.161 --> 22:41.397
Heading to work
bright and early?

22:41.465 --> 22:44.300
You're wounded, Signor.

22:44.368 --> 22:45.401
Hired killers.

22:45.469 --> 22:46.902
Attacked last night.

22:46.970 --> 22:49.438
I'm told Duke Federico
sent them.

22:49.506 --> 22:52.108
Through the windows, yeah.

22:52.175 --> 22:55.511
Something about last night
strikes me as odd.

22:55.579 --> 22:57.847
Years ago, Federico
carved away his nose

22:57.914 --> 23:00.549
to give himself
peripheral vision.

23:00.617 --> 23:03.619
He's the least subtle man
on the peninsular.

23:03.687 --> 23:07.156
The kind
who charges city gates.

23:07.224 --> 23:10.126
Not the kind who sends hired assassins
through palace windows.

23:10.193 --> 23:13.829
Who else do you suspect?
I don't know.

23:13.897 --> 23:19.402
Who profits most from the extinction
of the Medici line?

23:19.469 --> 23:21.680
The Medicis have made
many enemies.

23:21.705 --> 23:22.104
True.

23:22.105 --> 23:23.806
Thank God we have you,
Signor.

23:23.874 --> 23:26.509
For if the assassins
had succeeded,

23:26.576 --> 23:31.947
you would be the unquestioned head
of the bank.

23:32.015 --> 23:33.716
Perhaps our profits
would benefit.

23:33.784 --> 23:35.651
It was easy for you
to blame the Duke,

23:35.719 --> 23:37.553
with his troops
enforcing the embargo.

23:37.621 --> 23:39.889
I don't like your tone,
Signor.

23:39.956 --> 23:43.492
You don't? Then you're
going to hate this.

23:43.560 --> 23:45.094
Admit your role publically

23:45.162 --> 23:48.998
and I will do you the kindness of only
slicing off your ear.

23:49.065 --> 23:51.801
I'll even let you choose which one.
You'd never do that here.

23:51.868 --> 23:54.937
Even the son of a bastard slave
girl isn't that mad.

23:55.005 --> 23:56.806
Do tell me
what kind of man I am.

23:56.873 --> 23:59.008
Suppose I did admit it...

24:00.010 --> 24:01.501
the Pope himself
would defend me.

24:01.502 --> 24:02.863
The Pope has
damned us anyway.

24:02.931 --> 24:04.498
Might as well act like it.

24:04.566 --> 24:07.034
How much did you pay
your killers, Sassetti?

24:07.102 --> 24:09.270
Five florins?

24:09.338 --> 24:11.606
Eight?

24:11.673 --> 24:13.207
10.

24:13.275 --> 24:15.109
Pity you didn't
get your money's worth.

24:15.177 --> 24:19.680
Signor, you wouldn't...

24:19.748 --> 24:21.782
As you reminded me
just now,

24:21.850 --> 24:25.586
I am a bastard.

25:01.890 --> 25:03.290
<i>There's an even 100</i>
<i>of them.</i>

25:03.358 --> 25:04.892
<i>How do we know which</i>
<i>one's the right hole?</i>

25:04.960 --> 25:07.161
A question
I ask myself often.

25:09.998 --> 25:11.966
Take the key.

25:12.034 --> 25:13.734
My Dreamer.

25:47.369 --> 25:49.503
It can't simply be
a process of elimination.

25:49.571 --> 25:50.705
It wasn't last time.

25:58.046 --> 25:59.246
It's an amazing design.

26:01.750 --> 26:04.518
An even number of keyholes

26:04.586 --> 26:09.023
and yet there's a centre
to the array.

26:28.577 --> 26:31.178
Nice work, my Dreamer.

26:32.647 --> 26:33.781
99 to go.

26:53.034 --> 26:54.490
We must save the key
for another attempt.

26:54.515 --> 26:55.936
No, I can solve this.

26:55.937 --> 26:57.671
Just give me the key!

26:59.574 --> 27:00.875
Trust me.

27:03.945 --> 27:06.113
We are the Sun
and the Moon.

27:21.129 --> 27:23.030
There's constellations
on every lock

27:23.098 --> 27:25.533
except that one.
It's the sun.

27:25.600 --> 27:26.800
It's the god
they worship here.

27:28.570 --> 27:30.124
It's speeding up.

27:30.149 --> 27:32.149
There's no time.
Just let me think!

27:32.340 --> 27:34.475
The amount of locks in each row
adds up to a prime number.

27:34.543 --> 27:36.177
The whole thing
adds up to 100.

27:36.244 --> 27:38.012
100 is surely
not a prime number.

27:38.079 --> 27:41.448
But 101 is.

27:41.516 --> 27:44.451
There must be a single solitary
keyhole somewhere else

27:44.519 --> 27:47.755
so the entire thing
adds up to 101.

27:54.863 --> 27:57.231
Brace me.
Leo.

28:01.603 --> 28:03.137
Zo!

28:31.867 --> 28:33.167
Pull me up. Pull me up!

28:33.235 --> 28:34.368
Pull me up.

28:42.978 --> 28:45.779
Wait for me, Leonardo.

28:45.847 --> 28:48.315
I will be with you soon.

28:55.657 --> 28:58.259
But you will not wait
for her, will you?

29:01.796 --> 29:05.799
Why would Rome send two such as
you to parley with me?

29:05.867 --> 29:10.671
We were chosen so none would suspect
our mission as we travelled.

29:10.739 --> 29:12.706
The Holy Father
is keenly aware

29:12.774 --> 29:14.608
that this undertaking
is of a delicate nature.

29:14.676 --> 29:15.776
As is your beauty.

29:15.844 --> 29:19.980
Which no doubt aided you
in reaching my encampment.

29:20.048 --> 29:21.448
You are the eldest son
of the Sultan

29:21.516 --> 29:23.217
and heir to
the Ottoman Empire.

29:23.285 --> 29:26.353
Your strength
is second to none.

29:26.421 --> 29:28.155
<i>I wouldn't dare</i>
<i>seek an audience</i>

29:28.223 --> 29:30.891
<i>with only my charm to convince</i>
<i>you of my goodwill.</i>

29:47.709 --> 29:50.244
<i>I trust you will</i>
<i>recognize this.</i>

30:01.089 --> 30:03.390
It cannot be.

30:03.458 --> 30:04.825
<i>The Sword of Osman.</i>

30:04.893 --> 30:07.194
We travelled
many miles knowing

30:07.262 --> 30:08.495
its significance
would be lost

30:08.563 --> 30:10.124
<i>if we failed to deliver it</i>
<i>to your hands</i>

30:10.165 --> 30:11.365
<i>and to your hands alone.</i>

30:23.311 --> 30:24.778
What did you say
your name was?

30:29.884 --> 30:32.353
Amelia.

30:32.420 --> 30:35.923
Well, then, Amelia,
perhaps we should speak further.

30:48.169 --> 30:49.336
<i>Lupo.</i>

31:02.884 --> 31:05.386
You risk coming to me
again?

31:05.453 --> 31:07.688
I serve a false Pope.

31:07.756 --> 31:10.791
And you refuse to
leave this cell.

31:10.859 --> 31:13.193
What other choice
do I have?

31:13.261 --> 31:16.797
Have faith that my plans
proceed as they must.

31:16.865 --> 31:20.901
I intend to take
my rightful place

31:20.969 --> 31:23.771
at the appropriate time.

31:23.838 --> 31:27.641
The Bible has offered me
no guidance here.

31:27.709 --> 31:31.145
So you've turned
to another book?

31:31.212 --> 31:34.415
Oh, Lupo.

31:34.482 --> 31:37.751
The Book of Leaves
is a distraction.

31:37.819 --> 31:39.753
Here my brother
and I agree.

31:39.821 --> 31:44.992
Your brother has hidden
the page from me.

31:45.060 --> 31:47.961
Locked it away in the bowels
of the secret archives,

31:48.029 --> 31:51.698
forbidden me from even
touching it.

31:53.701 --> 31:58.038
It cannot solve
the world's ills.

31:59.274 --> 32:04.678
The world may be broken
beyond repair, Francesco.

32:04.746 --> 32:07.081
It is our only recourse.

32:07.148 --> 32:09.383
Do not raise suspicion.

32:09.451 --> 32:12.286
And do not abandon me.

32:12.353 --> 32:18.092
The Devil sits on the papal throne and
your place is at my side.

32:18.159 --> 32:22.062
The era of scholarly
reflection is over.

32:22.130 --> 32:24.765
What the Lord needs,

32:24.833 --> 32:27.201
when the time comes,

32:27.268 --> 32:30.337
is a man of action.

32:32.740 --> 32:36.777
Should I pray
for another?

32:36.845 --> 32:38.378
Or are you that man?

32:42.750 --> 32:44.718
Of course I am,

32:44.786 --> 32:47.387
Your Holiness.

33:19.687 --> 33:21.088
How is the girl?

33:21.156 --> 33:22.656
Vanessa is fine.

33:22.724 --> 33:24.958
Her child as well.
Good.

33:25.026 --> 33:28.095
I hear there is an open position
in the bank.

33:28.163 --> 33:31.365
Signor Sassetti has
left us quite abruptly.

33:31.432 --> 33:33.967
Finance is
a stressful business.

33:34.035 --> 33:37.538
I am grateful for a reliable partner
in our business.

33:46.181 --> 33:48.448
The servants know about
Lorenzo and Lucrezia.

33:48.516 --> 33:51.351
Clearly they know about us.

33:51.419 --> 33:53.554
I do appreciate however
that for women

33:53.621 --> 33:55.956
reputation is
a delicate thing.

33:57.992 --> 34:00.994
Are you sure you know
what you're doing?

34:01.062 --> 34:04.164
What I'm doing...

34:04.232 --> 34:06.200
is what I damn
well please.

34:20.681 --> 34:22.748
What now?

34:52.880 --> 34:56.382
A pair of keyholes and a key
that separates into two.

34:56.451 --> 35:01.321
Finally,
a simple solution.

35:07.895 --> 35:09.029
Hey.

35:11.199 --> 35:12.366
Unhand me.

35:13.001 --> 35:14.635
Unhand me first.

35:22.377 --> 35:25.245
They took our weapons.
This one I took back.

35:26.347 --> 35:29.650
From Zita's body.
You cock-sucker.

35:29.717 --> 35:31.184
I knew we couldn't
trust him.

35:31.252 --> 35:34.254
No, your friends understand
the value of my presence,

35:34.322 --> 35:38.125
where you are simply
a dog with a bone.

35:38.192 --> 35:40.827
Zo didn't want you
inserting the key prematurely.

35:40.895 --> 35:44.965
In case it activates
a river of lava or...

35:45.033 --> 35:47.234
venomous snakes.

35:47.302 --> 35:49.069
Or some other
fucking catastrophe.

35:49.137 --> 35:52.205
I see. So you really imagine
the architects of this structure

35:52.273 --> 35:57.177
would use the same
deception twice.

35:57.245 --> 35:59.279
It doesn't matter.

35:59.347 --> 36:02.316
Zo meant you no harm.
None of us do. We're in this together.

36:02.383 --> 36:06.286
And what then, Nico?
Do you truly imagine your Maestro

36:06.354 --> 36:09.856
would ever share what's behind
these doors with me?

36:09.924 --> 36:14.161
With the savage he wed
only for a chance at the book.

36:14.228 --> 36:16.897
I do.

36:16.964 --> 36:19.766
Then you've
learnt nothing.

36:19.834 --> 36:23.870
It's far easier to hate
than to trust.

36:25.073 --> 36:28.642
I learned that lesson
on our voyage here.

36:28.710 --> 36:30.310
From a woman you loved.

36:36.951 --> 36:39.986
Give me the dagger.

36:43.624 --> 36:45.625
And what of him?

36:45.693 --> 36:49.329
Zo, tell him
we're on the same side.

36:49.397 --> 36:54.101
Tell him!
Fine. Yeah, yeah.

36:55.203 --> 36:57.337
Yes.
Get the fucking blade off me.

37:00.007 --> 37:01.141
Guard it well.

37:07.348 --> 37:10.884
Now we have a riddle
to decipher.

37:10.952 --> 37:12.919
There are no markings,
no clues,

37:12.987 --> 37:15.088
to illuminate
which key goes in what hole.

37:15.156 --> 37:17.357
There's a simple solution.

37:21.262 --> 37:23.463
Why don't you let someone
who can pick a lock

37:23.531 --> 37:25.599
while drowning
at sea take a look?

37:25.666 --> 37:28.668
Dogs and their tricks.

37:48.256 --> 37:51.892
The weapon my father employs
for ceremonies is an artful replica

37:51.959 --> 37:56.229
constructed to disguise the loss
of the true sword.

37:57.832 --> 38:01.935
If any of our subjects knew
this had gone missing...

38:02.003 --> 38:04.704
I understand.

38:04.772 --> 38:08.074
We discovered it languishing in the
corridors of the Vatican.

38:08.142 --> 38:11.478
<i>His Holiness was ashamed</i>
<i>to keep it from its rightful home.</i>

38:13.014 --> 38:16.216
I pray this gift demonstrates our good
intentions, bey-effendi.

38:16.284 --> 38:20.053
And what is it
you want in return?

38:20.121 --> 38:21.888
To bring you to Rome.

38:23.758 --> 38:25.158
Me?

38:25.226 --> 38:30.230
You. The future of
the Ottoman Empire.

38:30.298 --> 38:32.899
It's common knowledge
that my half-brother Cem

38:32.967 --> 38:36.136
is the favored child
of my father the Sultan.

38:36.204 --> 38:39.739
But you are the first-born
and you carry the blood

38:39.807 --> 38:42.542
and now the blade
of Osman the First.

38:43.778 --> 38:46.646
Some might say it is
your destiny to rule.

38:46.714 --> 38:48.849
You dare suggest
I kill my brother?

38:48.916 --> 38:52.586
I merely offer you a chance
to demonstrate to your father

38:52.653 --> 38:55.589
that you are the most
deserving heir.

39:00.461 --> 39:04.030
Imagine a future where
the Ottomans ruled the East

39:04.098 --> 39:06.967
and the Vatican
rules the West.

39:08.803 --> 39:11.805
This glory could be yours

39:11.873 --> 39:14.941
if you are brave enough
to forge peace.

39:15.009 --> 39:18.478
There is no need to spill another drop
of Ottoman blood.

39:20.248 --> 39:24.084
There is no need to repeat
what happened to your brother.

39:24.151 --> 39:26.987
Cem has been nothing but
fortunate his entire life.

39:27.054 --> 39:29.022
That is not
the brother I meant.

39:34.128 --> 39:36.997
Forgive me, bey-effendi,
if I misspoke.

39:37.064 --> 39:39.799
You cannot be blamed
for your doubts.

39:39.867 --> 39:43.537
Perhaps we should
approach your father

39:43.604 --> 39:45.338
or Cem instead.

39:50.912 --> 39:51.945
<i>Wait.</i>

39:58.753 --> 40:01.988
It's his key in that hole.

40:02.056 --> 40:05.592
This one in the other.

40:05.660 --> 40:07.027
Good work.

40:07.094 --> 40:08.995
Yeah. I fucking hope so.

40:56.344 --> 40:58.578
Perhaps they need to be turned
simultaneously.

40:58.646 --> 41:01.848
On three.
One, two, three.

41:07.788 --> 41:10.123
Nothing.

41:22.570 --> 41:24.304
Good evening, gentlemen.

41:27.775 --> 41:30.577
<i>His Holiness has forbidden</i>
<i>access, Your Grace.</i>

41:35.249 --> 41:36.549
No matter.

41:40.755 --> 41:43.423
No openings.

41:43.491 --> 41:45.725
And no engravings.

41:45.793 --> 41:47.994
Anyone who wins their way
past this threshold

41:48.062 --> 41:50.964
will behold
the Book of Leaves itself.

41:52.633 --> 41:56.469
So we have to evince at least
a rudimentary level of understanding...

42:02.009 --> 42:05.111
Oh...

42:06.080 --> 42:07.514
wait...

42:20.594 --> 42:22.162
Oh, the engineering's amazing.

42:29.670 --> 42:33.773
No wonder that
the natives believed

42:33.841 --> 42:38.244
that their land
was visited by gods.

42:39.613 --> 42:44.517
Two keyholes, two keys,

42:44.585 --> 42:47.787
and the only thing
tying them together...

42:47.855 --> 42:49.456
One sun.

42:49.523 --> 42:50.890
What?

42:50.958 --> 42:54.561
We must turn the keys
when the light falls upon them.

42:54.628 --> 42:56.196
Doors don't have eyes.

42:58.299 --> 42:59.299
These might.

43:40.541 --> 43:42.776
There must be a pattern.

43:44.745 --> 43:46.613
On my word.

43:52.820 --> 43:53.853
Now!

44:19.713 --> 44:21.648
Well...

44:21.715 --> 44:26.719
The keys, they just need
to be turned and held.

44:40.701 --> 44:41.901
Wait for it.

44:45.472 --> 44:47.874
Wait for it.

44:47.942 --> 44:49.409
Now!

44:54.081 --> 44:55.849
Keep them turned.

45:59.513 --> 46:01.514
What is this place?

46:38.052 --> 46:40.653
There were giants in
the earth in those days.

46:43.057 --> 46:45.325
Perhaps these
are the Nephilims,

46:45.392 --> 46:49.729
the offspring of the sons of God
and the daughters of man

46:49.797 --> 46:53.633
and they created
this vault.

46:53.701 --> 46:55.568
Well, I'm normally
opposed to assuming

46:55.636 --> 47:00.406
every wonder must have
supernatural origins

47:00.474 --> 47:02.542
but all of this...

47:49.723 --> 47:53.926
No other way out
but heaven.

47:53.994 --> 47:56.863
Well, I believe those
symbols may imply there are

47:56.930 --> 47:59.032
other ways out of here.

48:02.036 --> 48:05.671
Perhaps like
the Abyssinian,

48:05.739 --> 48:08.775
my mother
found one of them.

48:11.678 --> 48:14.414
Let's get
what we came here for.

48:17.985 --> 48:19.485
<i>Leonardo...</i>

48:23.991 --> 48:25.992
Did you hear that?

48:26.060 --> 48:27.894
Not a sound.

48:39.039 --> 48:43.676
I offer you the services
of my companion to guide you to Rome.

48:43.744 --> 48:45.242
And if it pleases you

48:45.267 --> 48:47.452
I will remain here and await
word of your success

48:47.848 --> 48:49.849
and as surety of
our trust in each other.

48:49.917 --> 48:53.086
That trust
only goes so far.

48:53.153 --> 48:55.721
Keep her under guard
outside the city gates.

48:55.789 --> 48:58.558
She will not receive
a single visitor.

48:58.625 --> 49:00.960
She will not exchange
a single message.

49:01.028 --> 49:03.696
Bey-effendi, I have put myself
at great risk

49:03.764 --> 49:04.864
in coming here to you

49:04.932 --> 49:06.899
and yet you repay me
with incarceration?

49:06.967 --> 49:08.734
I am the son
of the Sultan

49:08.802 --> 49:11.537
about to embark on a journey
to the den of my sworn enemy.

49:11.605 --> 49:14.974
Do not speak to me of risk.
This is not what we agreed upon.

49:21.048 --> 49:24.450
Charm, beauty,

49:24.518 --> 49:25.952
intelligence.

49:26.019 --> 49:29.489
I cannot trust a woman
with so many weapons at her disposal.

49:31.158 --> 49:32.959
There's someone here.

49:33.026 --> 49:36.929
I heard a voice.
There is nothing.

49:36.997 --> 49:40.833
Just listen.
Listen carefully.

49:42.703 --> 49:45.938
There's someone...
No, no no!

49:47.674 --> 49:49.775
Ssh, ssh.

49:51.078 --> 49:53.779
Just listen carefully.

49:53.847 --> 49:57.283
There is nothing.
Ssh.

50:00.087 --> 50:02.922
There's someone here
with us!

50:02.990 --> 50:05.291
There's someone here.

50:10.931 --> 50:12.965
What have you done
to my friends?

50:13.033 --> 50:18.604
It is you
who have caused them pain.

50:18.672 --> 50:22.475
You enter the vault
without me by your side?

50:52.139 --> 50:54.907
No, no, wait, wait.

50:58.545 --> 51:01.714
Don't do this.

51:03.450 --> 51:04.584
No, no!

51:12.826 --> 51:15.761
Fine.

51:23.637 --> 51:26.372
I'm sorry, my Dreamer.

51:26.440 --> 51:28.074
My visions
were very clear.

51:28.141 --> 51:30.076
You were to lead me
to this point

51:30.143 --> 51:35.081
and I, in turn, would lead
my people to salvation.

51:35.148 --> 51:37.550
No matter the cost.

51:37.618 --> 51:39.852
So are we not
joined as one?

51:42.089 --> 51:45.858
From the moment
you arrived,

51:45.926 --> 51:50.396
it's been obvious your
heart belongs to another.

52:00.841 --> 52:03.442
<i>Leonardo!</i>

52:12.486 --> 52:15.888
You heard that.
I did.

52:21.895 --> 52:24.330
That's my mother.

52:24.398 --> 52:26.932
No! That's my mother!

52:27.000 --> 52:28.567
No!
