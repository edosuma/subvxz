04:24.446 --> 04:26.864

SEEING ARTHUR GET MARRIED.

05:06.055 --> 05:08.039
I'M VERY HAPPY FOR HIM.

05:08.106 --> 05:09.841
WHY WOULD YOU SAY THAT?

05:09.909 --> 05:13.511
WELL, YOU'VE BEEN SOBBING

OH, HEY, ARTHUR.

PLACE CARDS YOU WANTED.

05:20.886 --> 05:23.755

05:26.208 --> 05:29.193

I GUESS I ALWAYS KNEW YOU'D
WIND UP WITH SOMEONE LIKE THAT.

05:47.946 --> 05:49.581
YOU DESERVE IT.

05:49.648 --> 05:52.950
YOU'RE A GOOD LOSER,
VERONICA,

05:53.018 --> 05:55.920
THE BEST LOSER

06:05.330 --> 06:07.498

06:09.301 --> 06:10.885
AH, NO, NO.

06:10.953 --> 06:12.120
IT'S JUST, UM...

06:12.188 --> 06:15.756
DO YOU KNOW THERE'S
A MAN WITH NO PANTS BACK HERE?

06:15.824 --> 06:17.859
OH, YEAH. THAT'S-
THAT'S THE BEST MAN.

06:17.926 --> 06:19.660
HE'S SLEEPIN' OFF
A COUPLE SIX-PACKS.

06:19.728 --> 06:23.264
DO ME A FAVOR AND, UH,
GIVE HIM A SMACK, WILL YA?

06:23.332 --> 06:24.498
OH, OK.

06:28.487 --> 06:30.955
Y- YOU GOTTA
REALLY DRILL HIM.

06:31.023 --> 06:34.291
I'M NOT COMFORTABLE
DRILLING ANYONE ON SHABBOS.

06:34.359 --> 06:35.392
ALL RIGHT.

06:35.460 --> 06:37.161
I'LL TAKE CARE
OF IT.

06:37.229 --> 06:39.397
HANG ON.

06:39.465 --> 06:43.568
AW, DEAC, GOTTA TELL YA, GETTIN'

OK.
OK.

06:51.643 --> 06:53.377
OH, YOU LOOK BEAUTIFUL.

06:53.445 --> 06:54.579
REALLY?

06:54.646 --> 06:57.231
I'M SO NERVOUS.

06:57.298 --> 06:58.182
OH, YOU'RE GONNA BE FINE.

06:58.250 --> 07:00.451
AT MY LAST WEDDING,
I PASSED OUT

07:00.519 --> 07:02.153
RIGHT INTO
A CHOPPED-LIVER SWAN.

07:02.220 --> 07:06.941
BUT GERALD WAS
SO UNDERSTANDING.

07:07.008 --> 07:10.044
OH, GOD REST HIS SOUL.

07:10.112 --> 07:12.146
THAT WAS
YOUR LAST HUSBAND?

07:12.214 --> 07:13.948
YEAH. WELL...

07:14.015 --> 07:15.950
AFTER THE FIRST JERK
I MARRIED,

07:16.017 --> 07:19.387
I DECIDED FROM NOW ON,
ONLY GAY MEN.

07:19.455 --> 07:22.089
15-MINUTE WARNING.

07:22.157 --> 07:23.124
OH.

07:23.191 --> 07:25.326
AVA, DARLING,
THAT DRESS IS DELICIOUS.

07:25.394 --> 07:28.095
YOU'RE A VISION IN CHIFFON.

07:29.014 --> 07:30.965
I CAN'T WAIT
TO RIP IT OFF TONIGHT

07:31.033 --> 07:33.835
AND FINALLY
HAVE MY WAY WITH YOU.

07:43.195 --> 07:45.863
COULD I-COULD I HELP AT ALL?
OR ARE YOU...

07:45.931 --> 07:49.166
YEAH, YOU KNOW WHAT? JUST, UH,
LET ME BRIDGE OFF YOUR SHOULDER.

07:49.234 --> 07:51.119
I'M GONNA HAVE TO FIRE MY HIPS OFF
- THERE WE GO.

07:51.186 --> 07:52.503
AAH!
I'M GETTIN' UNDER IT.

07:52.571 --> 07:53.103
WHAT'S GOIN' ON
BACK THERE?

07:53.171 --> 07:54.655
YOU DON'T HAVE
YOUR PANTS ON YET?

07:54.723 --> 07:58.459
THE RABBI AND I ARE
WORKING ON IT, THANK YOU.

07:58.527 --> 08:00.211
IT'S BEEN 2 HOURS.

08:00.278 --> 08:01.095
THERE'S NO ROOM
BACK HERE.

08:01.246 --> 08:02.413
WHY THE HELL DIDN'T YOU
TAKE THE MINIVAN?

08:02.481 --> 08:03.998
AW, KELLY'S GOT IT.
SHE DOESN'T LIKE

08:04.066 --> 08:05.632
DRIVING THIS CAR.
IT'S TOO SMALL.

08:05.700 --> 08:07.685
OH, GREAT. SO SHE GIVES IT
TO HER 8- FOOT-TALL HUSBAND.

08:07.753 --> 08:10.187
YEAH, I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU
AREN'T THE ONE GETTING DIVORCED.

08:10.255 --> 08:11.839
HEY, HEY. STOP TALKIN'
ABOUT DIVORCE, WILL YOU?

08:11.907 --> 08:13.373
YOU GUYS
ARE GONNA BE FINE.

08:13.441 --> 08:14.942
YOU ALWAYS WORK
THESE THINGS OUT.

08:15.010 --> 08:16.043
SHE SCREAMS.
YOU CRY.

08:16.111 --> 08:17.945
2 PIZZAS LATER, YOU'RE BACK TO NORMAL.

08:18.013 --> 08:19.731
BUT THIS IS DIFFERENT,
DEAC, OK?

08:19.798 --> 08:22.133
WE HAD A COMMITMENT
ABOUT OUR FUTURE, AND-

08:22.200 --> 08:24.536
AND SHE JUST DIDN'T
HOLD UP HER END.

08:24.603 --> 08:27.004
THAT'S NOT RIGHT, IS IT?

08:27.072 --> 08:29.206
WELL, I CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND
WHY YOU'RE UPSET,

08:29.274 --> 08:32.308
BUT I ALSO KNOW THAT GOD
BELIEVES IN FORGIVENESS.

08:32.376 --> 08:33.144
YEAH, I'M-

08:33.212 --> 08:36.530
IS THAT JUST YOUR GOD
OR ANY GOD?

08:36.597 --> 08:39.866
DO YOU THINK YOU AND I
HAVE DIFFERENT GODS?

08:39.933 --> 08:42.003
NO. NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.

08:42.071 --> 08:45.806
OH. I MEAN, YEAH.
ONLY 'CAUSE...

08:45.874 --> 08:47.408
MY GOD IS...

08:47.476 --> 08:49.243
JESUS.

08:49.311 --> 08:51.179
BUT, UH-BUT FROM
WHAT I UNDERSTAND,

08:51.246 --> 08:53.197
MY GOD IS THE SON
OF YOUR GOD,

08:53.265 --> 08:55.266
SO I'M SURE THEY'RE
ON VERY GOOD TERMS.

08:55.333 --> 08:57.368
THEY PROBABLY SEE
EACH OTHER ALL THE TIME,

08:57.435 --> 08:58.936
YOU KNOW, HOLIDAYS,
FAMILY FUNCTIONS.

08:59.004 --> 09:00.587
WHAT THE HELL
WAS THAT FOR?!

09:00.655 --> 09:03.057
TO SHUT YOU UP.

09:04.259 --> 09:05.977
DON'T GIVE ME
YOUR BACK TALK!

09:06.044 --> 09:09.931
<i>THERE ARE PLENTY OF HARPISTS OUT
THERE WHO WILL PLAY DUELING BANJOS!</i>

09:09.998 --> 09:11.566
YOU SENT FOR ME, DARLIN'?

09:11.633 --> 09:13.801
YES. DAD, I, UM...

09:13.869 --> 09:14.602
WHERE'S AVA?

09:14.670 --> 09:16.487
WELL, THAT'S ACTUALLY
WHAT I WANNA...

09:17.823 --> 09:19.456
AVA LEFT, DAD.

09:19.524 --> 09:20.591
WHAT?

09:20.659 --> 09:21.876
YEAH,
SHE WAS VERY UPSET.

09:21.943 --> 09:24.345
SHE'S-SHE'S VERY SORRY,
BUT SHE CAN'T MARRY YOU.

09:24.413 --> 09:26.130
WH-WHY?

09:26.197 --> 09:27.599
WELL, UH...

09:27.666 --> 09:29.567
TURNS OUT AVA...

09:29.635 --> 09:33.270
LIKE, UH, MANY WOMEN
IN SHOW BUSINESS,

09:33.338 --> 09:35.690
WANTED A DIFFERENT KIND
OF HUSBAND,

09:35.757 --> 09:38.559
MORE OF A COMPANION.

09:38.626 --> 09:41.378
I WAS A WONDERFUL COMPANION.

09:41.446 --> 09:43.764
YEAH. YEAH.

09:43.832 --> 09:45.266
UH...

09:45.334 --> 09:48.970
BUT SHE WANTED A
COMPANION WHO WAS ALSO...

09:49.037 --> 09:50.471
A CHOREOGRAPHER...

09:52.307 --> 09:53.991
TYPE.

09:55.327 --> 09:57.929
A HAIRDRESSER TYPE.

09:59.214 --> 10:01.381
YOU DON'T SEE WHERE
I'M GOIN' WITH THIS?

10:01.449 --> 10:03.100
SHE WANTED A BLACK MAN?

10:03.168 --> 10:05.637
GAY, DAD.
SHE WANTED A GAY MAN.

10:05.704 --> 10:07.404
SHE THOUGHT
YOU WERE GAY.

10:07.472 --> 10:08.456
THAT'S PREPOSTEROUS.

10:08.524 --> 10:10.842
THAT'S NOT WHAT
SHE WANTS AT ALL.

10:10.909 --> 10:12.126
DAD, LOOK.

10:12.194 --> 10:14.762
THIS IS A PICTURE OF
GERALD, HER LAST HUSBAND.

10:14.829 --> 10:17.398
WHAT DO YOU SEE
WHEN YOU LOOK AT THAT?

10:17.466 --> 10:19.200
I SEE A NORMAL
HETEROSEXUAL MAN

10:19.268 --> 10:21.335
LEAPING INTO THE AIR
WITH A PARASOL.

10:22.504 --> 10:24.572
HOW DID I NOT
NOTICE THAT BEFORE?

10:25.840 --> 10:27.908
I'M SORRY, DADDY.

10:27.976 --> 10:29.327
BUT I STILL
DON'T UNDERSTAND.

10:29.394 --> 10:34.031
WHAT DID I EVER DO TO GIVE HER
THE IMPRESSION THAT I WAS GAY?

10:39.053 --> 10:40.388
HEY.

10:45.360 --> 10:49.580
IN RETROSPECT, THAT WAS AN UNFORTUNATE
CHOICE OF HALLOWEEN COSTUME.

10:56.137 --> 10:57.621
DAD, LOOK,
I KNOW THIS IS HARD,

10:57.689 --> 11:00.674
BUT WE HAVE A HUNDRED GUESTS OUT THERE
WAITING FOR THE CEREMONY TO START.

11:00.742 --> 11:02.643
YOU HAVE TO GO OUT THERE
AND TELL 'EM.

11:02.710 --> 11:05.212
BUT I HAD MY HEART SET
ON BEING MARRIED TODAY.

11:05.280 --> 11:06.947
NOT JUST MY HEART.

11:07.015 --> 11:09.750
I TOOK ENOUGH CIALIS
FOR A HOCKEY TEAM.

11:11.152 --> 11:14.355
THE BOTTOM LINE IS, DAD,
AVA'S NOT COMING BACK.

11:14.422 --> 11:16.290
BUT I COULD
BE GAY FOR HER.

11:16.357 --> 11:20.460
I COULD BE THE GAYEST MAN
THE WORLD HAS EVER SEEN!

11:20.528 --> 11:21.445
I KNOW YOU COULD.

11:23.147 --> 11:25.082
BUT-BUT IT'S OVER, DAD.

11:45.270 --> 11:46.637
ARTHUR, WHAT'S THIS
ALL ABOUT?

11:46.704 --> 11:48.239
WHY ARE WE IN HERE?

11:48.306 --> 11:50.440
I NEED TO SPEAK
TO YOU PRIVATELY.

11:52.010 --> 11:54.278
WHAT ARE YOU, A SURGEON?
BEAT IT!

11:59.151 --> 12:01.368
SO WHAT IS IT?

12:01.436 --> 12:02.787
VERONICA, SOMETHING
MARVELOUS HAS HAPPENED.

12:02.854 --> 12:07.391
I SUDDENLY REALIZED IT'S NOT AVA
I WANNA MARRY TODAY. IT'S YOU.

12:07.458 --> 12:10.478
WHAT?
YOU WANNA MARRY ME?

12:10.545 --> 12:12.329
YES. I'M PROPOSING TO YOU.

12:12.397 --> 12:14.998
I WOULD HAVE DONE IT
YEARS AGO, BUT...

12:15.066 --> 12:17.668
I FOUND YOUR BEAUTY
INTIMIDATING.

12:17.736 --> 12:19.270
SHE DUMPED YOU, HUH?

12:19.338 --> 12:21.439
YEAH.

12:21.507 --> 12:23.273
APPARENTLY I'M NOT
MAN ENOUGH FOR HER.

12:23.341 --> 12:26.894
OR I'M TOO MUCH MAN.
IT'S ALL VERY CONFUSING.

12:26.962 --> 12:30.047
SO NOW YOU'RE TRYIN' TO JAM
ME IN AS YOUR SECOND CHOICE?

12:30.114 --> 12:32.015
WELL, LET ME TELL YOU
SOMETHING, ARTHUR.

12:32.083 --> 12:35.586
I MAY NOT BE THE QUEEN OF
ENGLAND OR EVEN AVA ST. CLAIR,

12:35.654 --> 12:39.323
BUT I DESERVE MORE THAN BEING
PROPOSED TO IN FRONT OF A URINAL.

12:39.390 --> 12:42.643
LOOK, LOOK, LOOK, I ADMIT I'VE NEVER
SHOWN YOU THE RESPECT YOU DESERVE.

12:42.711 --> 12:45.112
I WAS PETTY AND VAIN AND
THOUGHT I COULD DO BETTER,

12:45.180 --> 12:46.764
BUT I REALIZE NOW
THAT I CAN'T.

12:48.900 --> 12:50.818
PRIDE GOETH
BEFORE A FALL.

12:50.886 --> 12:53.304
PLEASE, VERONICA. I DON'T
WANNA DIE IN THAT BASEMENT.

12:53.371 --> 12:56.606
I'D MUCH RATHER DIE IN A
GROUND-FLOOR APARTMENT SUCH AS YOURS

12:56.674 --> 12:58.442
WITH YOU BY MY SIDE.

12:58.509 --> 13:01.595
THAT DOES SOUND NICE.

13:01.662 --> 13:04.281
I KNOW WE COULD LEARN
TO LOVE EACH OTHER.

13:04.349 --> 13:07.118
I ALREADY LOVE YOU,
ARTHUR.

13:07.186 --> 13:09.153
WELL, THEN,
WE'RE HALFWAY THERE.

13:15.460 --> 13:17.061
UM, GOOD AFTERNOON.

13:17.128 --> 13:20.864
EVERYBODY, AHEM,
I'M RABBI ELI FELDMAN.

13:20.932 --> 13:23.767
TODAY IN THE PRESENCE OF GOD,

13:23.836 --> 13:27.805
WE WILL BE JOINING TOGETHER
ARTHUR SPOONER AND AVA ST. CLAIR,

13:27.873 --> 13:31.408
2 WONDERFUL PEOPLE
WHO HAVE FOUND JOY, LOVE,

13:31.476 --> 13:32.359
AND HAPPI-

13:32.427 --> 13:33.777
EXCUSE ME A MINUTE.

13:33.845 --> 13:36.113
HAPPINESS IN EACH OTHER'S
SPIRITS. THANK YOU.

13:38.950 --> 13:41.018
"PLEASE TURNS OFF
ALL CELLPHONES AND PAGERS,

13:41.086 --> 13:44.922
<i>"AND IN YOUR PROGRAMS, WHEREVER
THE NAME AVA ST. CLAIR APPEARS,</i>

13:44.990 --> 13:46.991
<i>REPLACE IT

13:54.215 --> 13:55.549
Excuse me. Sorry.

13:55.616 --> 13:56.850
Sorry. Excuse me.

13:56.918 --> 13:58.218
HEY.
WHERE WERE YOU?

13:58.286 --> 14:00.921
DOUG GOT DRUNK AND
WOULDN'T PUT HIS PANTS ON.

14:02.957 --> 14:04.224
HOW'S IT GOIN' HERE?

14:04.293 --> 14:05.493
OH, ARTHUR
SWITCHED BRIDES.

14:05.560 --> 14:07.227
NOW HE'S MARRYING
SPENCE'S MOM.

14:07.296 --> 14:09.029
OH.

14:09.097 --> 14:11.932
DAD! WELL, WHAT THE HELL
IS GOING ON?

14:12.000 --> 14:13.266
MEET YOUR
NEW MOTHER.

14:14.736 --> 14:16.353
KEEP WEDNESDAYS FREE,
DARLING.

14:16.421 --> 14:19.223
THAT'S WHEN WE VISIT NANA
IN THE HOME.

14:19.291 --> 14:21.542
WHERE'S MY AUNT AVA?

14:21.609 --> 14:23.010
MOM, WHAT ARE
YOU DOING?

14:23.078 --> 14:24.327
WHAT DOES IT LOOK
LIKE I'M DOING?

14:24.395 --> 14:27.264
NOW, YOU JUST STAY THERE,
BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO GIVE ME AWAY.

14:27.331 --> 14:29.216
I'M NOT GIVING YOU AWAY!
THIS IS CRAZY!

14:29.284 --> 14:30.517
YES, THIS IS CRAZY!

14:30.585 --> 14:32.769
STOP TAKING
YOUR BROTHER'S SIDE!

14:36.041 --> 14:37.757
WHERE'S MY AUNT AVA?

14:37.825 --> 14:38.609
OH, DOUG,
THERE YOU ARE.

14:38.677 --> 14:39.960
DO YOU KNOW
WHAT'S GOING ON?

14:40.027 --> 14:41.979
AVA LEFT, AND NOW MY DAD
WANTS TO MARRY VERONICA.

14:42.047 --> 14:44.097
HMM. THAT'S NICE.

14:48.553 --> 14:50.204
HE-HE WANTS US
TO START.

14:50.271 --> 14:52.373
SWEETHEART, I THINK
YOU GO DOWN FIRST.

14:52.440 --> 14:54.574
WHERE'S MY AUNT AVA?

14:54.642 --> 14:57.277
SHE'S YOUR AUNT AVA. NOW GET MOVIN'!

14:58.579 --> 15:00.414
IT'S ALL RIGHT.
IT'S ALL RIGHT.

15:02.450 --> 15:06.070
DAD, ARE YOU SURE
YOU WANNA DO THIS?

15:06.137 --> 15:08.205
YOU REALLY WANNA
MARRY VERONICA?

15:08.273 --> 15:10.324
WHY? YOU GOT
SOMEONE BETTER?

15:11.326 --> 15:13.728
OY. ALL RIGHT,
LET'S JUST START.

15:13.795 --> 15:14.661
LET'S JUST START.

15:19.284 --> 15:21.552
PIECE OF WORK,
THAT MAN, RIGHT?

15:21.619 --> 15:25.556
YEAH. WELL, AT LEAST HE DOESN'T TELL
VICIOUS LIES TO THE PEOPLE THAT LOVE HIM.

15:25.623 --> 15:28.625
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
HE DOES THAT EVERY DAY.

15:28.693 --> 15:30.561
WHAT'S THE MATTER
WITH YOU, ANYWAY?

15:30.628 --> 15:32.997
YOU KNOW WHAT? I DON'T THINK I
FEEL LIKE DISCUSSING IT RIGHT NOW.

15:48.046 --> 15:50.147
THANKS FOR COMIN'.
I'M NOT GAY.

15:50.215 --> 15:51.649
THANKS FOR COMIN'.
NOT GAY.

15:51.716 --> 15:53.517
HELLO, ZACHARY.
I'M NOT GAY.

15:56.204 --> 15:59.423
I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU'RE DOING THIS.

15:59.491 --> 16:01.258
I LOVE HIM, SPENCER.

16:01.326 --> 16:03.394
HE'S TREATING YOU
LIKE AN OLD DISHRAG.

16:03.462 --> 16:05.429
NO MARRIAGE IS PERFECT.

16:11.519 --> 16:13.304
OK. AHEM.

16:13.372 --> 16:15.306

IT'S A HEBREW PRAYER.

16:25.584 --> 16:27.717
WHY HEBREW?

16:27.785 --> 16:31.371
WELL, THE-THE ORIGINAL

16:37.295 --> 16:39.429

16:39.497 --> 16:41.098
IT'S A VERY NICE

CARRIE, YOUR PHONE WAS GOING OFF
LIKE CRAZY DURING THE CEREMONY.

17:00.835 --> 17:02.670
YOU GOT, LIKE, 4 CALLS.
REALLY?

17:04.790 --> 17:07.590
OH, MY GOD.
IT'S THE ADOPTION AGENCY.

17:07.659 --> 17:09.358
DOUG-

17:14.648 --> 17:17.384
THERE YOU ARE.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

17:17.451 --> 17:20.170
JUST ENJOYING THE SMELLS
OF POUGHKEEPSIE.

17:22.490 --> 17:24.758
WELL, I HAVE
SOME VERY EXCITING NEWS.

17:24.826 --> 17:26.593
YOU'RE NOT GONNA BELIEVE IT.

17:26.661 --> 17:28.278
LOOK AT THIS PICTURE.
WHAT'S THAT?

17:28.346 --> 17:29.629
OUR CAR.

17:29.697 --> 17:31.415
OH. I BACKED INTO A POLE.

17:31.483 --> 17:33.016
THAT'S FOR
THE INSURANCE COMPANY.

17:33.084 --> 17:34.718
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.

17:34.786 --> 17:36.019
WHO'S THAT?

17:36.087 --> 17:38.221
I DON'T KNOW.
SOMEBODY'S BABY.

17:38.290 --> 17:40.824
YEAH. OUR BABY.

17:40.892 --> 17:42.576
OUR BABY.

17:44.412 --> 17:45.479
OH, MY GOD.

17:45.547 --> 17:47.147
YEAH. HER NAME
IS MING MEl.

17:47.214 --> 17:49.249
SHE'S 4 DAYS OLD.
ISN'T SHE BEAUTIFUL?

17:49.316 --> 17:51.601
ALL RIGHT, I HAVE TO CALL
THE ADOPTION AGENCY

17:51.669 --> 17:54.755
AND TELL THEM THAT WE'RE ON
THE NEXT FLIGHT OUT TO BEIJING.

17:54.823 --> 17:56.724
I'VE-I CAN'T BELIEVE
I'M MAKING THIS CALL.

17:56.791 --> 18:00.994
I MEAN, I'VE ORDERED CHINESE BEFORE,
BUT NEVER A BABY. AH HA HA! AHH!

18:01.062 --> 18:02.529
CARRIE, WE'RE NOT
DOING THIS.

18:03.698 --> 18:06.300
WHAT? WHAT ARE
YOU TALKING ABOUT?

18:06.367 --> 18:07.550
I KNOW ABOUT
THE APARTMENT,

18:07.618 --> 18:09.503
AND I KNOW YOU NEVER
GOT RID OF IT.

18:09.571 --> 18:11.354
OH, YEAH, THAT. HEH.

18:11.422 --> 18:13.023
WEIRD, HUH?

18:15.894 --> 18:17.260
UH...

18:17.328 --> 18:20.731
LOOK, DOUG, YOU HAVE
EVERY RIGHT TO BE UPSET, OK?

18:20.799 --> 18:24.635
I- I SHOULD'VE GOTTEN RID OF
IT A COUPLE WEEKS AGO, BUT I-

18:24.703 --> 18:26.369
BUT WHAT? I MEAN...

18:26.437 --> 18:28.522
BUT I WAS JUST NERVOUS ABOUT US
GETTING BACK TOGETHER.

18:28.590 --> 18:30.624
SO WAS I, YOU KNOW,
BUT WE MADE A DEAL.

18:30.692 --> 18:33.694
I MEAN, I QUIT MY JOB FOR
YOU, AND I LOVED THAT JOB.

18:33.761 --> 18:35.845
YOU HATED THAT JOB.
YOU SAID SO A THOUSAND TIMES.

18:35.913 --> 18:39.283
NO, I SAID I HATED HAVING
A JOB. THERE'S A DIFFERENCE.

18:39.351 --> 18:41.452
THE POINT IS I TOOK
A LEAP OF FAITH,

18:41.520 --> 18:43.903
FOR THE SAKE OF OUR
FUTURE, AND YOU DIDN'T.

18:43.971 --> 18:46.640
ALL RIGHT. WELL, I'M TAKING
MY LEAP OF FAITH NOW.

18:46.707 --> 18:48.325
IT DOESN'T COUNT NOW,
CARRIE. I MEAN,

18:48.393 --> 18:50.227
NOW YOU'RE JUST LEAPING
FOR THE BABY.

18:50.295 --> 18:52.295
ADMIT IT. YOU'VE NEVER
TAKEN A LEAP OF FAITH

18:52.447 --> 18:54.114
FOR ME
IN YOUR WHOLE LIFE.

18:54.182 --> 18:56.200
I MARRIED YOU.
WHAT DO YOU CALL THAT?

18:56.267 --> 18:57.417
UH, HITTING THE JACKPOT.

19:00.772 --> 19:04.191
GETTING MARRIED, THAT'S
NOT TAKING A LEAP OF FAITH.

19:04.259 --> 19:09.163
WHEN YOU GET MARRIED, YOU THINK
IT'S GONNA BE GREAT FOREVER.

19:09.230 --> 19:11.265
YOU KNOW, BUT THEN
10 YEARS DOWN THE LINE,

19:11.333 --> 19:16.286
YOU FINALLY START TO REALIZE, "WOW,
HE'S FAT, AND HE'S STAYIN' FAT."

19:16.354 --> 19:19.122
"MAN, SHE ISN'T GETTIN'
ANY NICER, IS SHE?"

19:20.041 --> 19:23.227
SMOKE CLEARS, AND IT'S
JUST THE TWO OF US

19:23.294 --> 19:26.997
STANDING THERE
FAT, MEAN, AND NAKED-

19:27.065 --> 19:30.868
THAT'S WHEN IT TAKES A
LEAP OF FAITH TO KEEP GOING,

19:30.935 --> 19:32.769
AND YOU DIDN'T,

19:32.837 --> 19:34.421
AND I CAN NEVER
FORGET THAT.

19:35.390 --> 19:37.741
OK, DOUG,
SO WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?

19:37.809 --> 19:39.610
ARE YOU SAYING WE'RE OVER?

19:39.678 --> 19:41.762
I GUESS I AM.

20:17.565 --> 20:18.715
THAT'S A GREAT SHOT.
SMILE.

20:18.783 --> 20:19.950
OHH.

20:21.152 --> 20:24.188
OH, ARTHUR, I'VE NEVER
BEEN SO HAPPY IN MY LIFE.

20:24.255 --> 20:27.257
IF OUR MARRIAGE ENDED
TOMORROW, I HAVE NO REGRETS.

20:27.325 --> 20:29.509
GOOD TO KNOW.

20:29.577 --> 20:32.396
HOLLY, HOW ARE YOU?

20:32.464 --> 20:33.596
HI, VERONICA.
HI, ARTHUR.

20:33.664 --> 20:35.732
CONGRATULATIONS.

20:35.800 --> 20:37.268
LOOK AT YOU.
YOU'RE PREGNANT.

20:37.335 --> 20:39.603
NO, NO. I MADE
THAT MISTAKE BEFORE.

20:39.671 --> 20:41.972
SHE HAS
AN EATING DISORDER.

20:42.039 --> 20:43.706
OH, NO, NO.
I ACTUALLY AM PREGNANT.

20:43.774 --> 20:45.959
OH, WONDERFUL. SO, WHERE'S YOUR HUSBAND?

20:46.027 --> 20:47.394
UH, YEAH. WHERE IS HE?

20:47.461 --> 20:49.897
UH, HE MUST'VE GONE
TO THE MEN'S ROOM.

20:49.964 --> 20:52.850
OH, THAT'S WHERE ARTHUR
PROPOSED TO ME.

20:52.917 --> 20:54.818
OH. I'VE HAD
THAT HAPPEN, YEAH.

20:54.886 --> 20:57.153
ACTUALLY, IT WAS MORE
OF A PORTA-POTTY.

20:57.221 --> 20:58.755
BUT ANYWAY,
CONGRATULATIONS.

20:58.823 --> 21:00.223
THANK YOU, SWEETHEART.

THANK YOU.

21:28.386 --> 21:30.103

I KNOW THINGS GOT UGLY

21:30.170 --> 21:31.671
BETWEEN US
WHEN I MOVED OUT,

21:31.739 --> 21:33.306
AND THAT-
THAT WAS MY FAULT,

21:33.374 --> 21:35.275
AND I JUST WANNA SAY
I'M SORRY.

21:35.342 --> 21:37.193
HEY, MAN, DON'T WORRY
ABOUT IT, BUDDY, ALL RIGHT?

21:37.261 --> 21:40.580

IF MAYBE I COULD...

21:50.024 --> 21:51.792
MOVE BACK...

21:52.777 --> 21:53.911
WHO'S THIS?

21:53.978 --> 21:57.146
THIS IS, UH, SANDY,
MY NEW GIRLFRIEND

21:57.214 --> 22:00.016
AND ROOMMATE.

22:00.084 --> 22:01.935
ROOMMATE? THAT'S...

22:02.003 --> 22:03.203
GREAT.

22:03.271 --> 22:04.888
YEAH, I MOVED IN
LAST WEEK.

22:04.956 --> 22:06.523
OH, I HAD TO PACK UP
SOME OF YOUR STUFF

22:06.591 --> 22:09.559
TO MAKE SOME ROOM
IN THE CLOSET, MOSTLY...

22:09.627 --> 22:11.929
MAGAZINES.

22:11.996 --> 22:15.065

PROJECT ABOUT THAILAND,

22:24.008 --> 22:25.209
VERY HAPPY. UM,

22:25.276 --> 22:27.911

FOR A SECOND?

22:34.218 --> 22:35.985
DOUG?

22:36.053 --> 22:37.136
SPENCER!

22:37.204 --> 22:39.439
HEY, BUDDY,

22:45.713 --> 22:47.413
AH.

22:47.481 --> 22:49.516
SIT DOWN. SIT DOWN.
OH, GOD.

22:49.584 --> 22:50.350
HEY.

22:50.417 --> 22:52.536
WHAT-WH-WHAT ARE YOU

22:52.603 --> 22:55.272
JUST CELEBRATIN'
MY FREEDOM.

22:56.441 --> 22:58.758
CARRIE AND I ARE
GETTIN' A DIVORCE.

22:58.826 --> 23:00.060
WHAT?!

23:00.127 --> 23:01.945
MM-HMM.
TURNS OUT SHE KEPT

23:02.013 --> 23:04.214
HER APARTMENT
IN MANHATTAN,

23:04.281 --> 23:07.618
SO SPLIT 'EM UP!

23:07.685 --> 23:09.953
DOUG, I HAVE
A CONFESSION TO MAKE.

23:10.021 --> 23:13.957
I'M THE ONE THAT CALLED AND TOLD
YOU SHE WAS STILL IN THE APARTMENT.

23:14.025 --> 23:15.091
OH, YEAH?
YEAH, I-

23:15.126 --> 23:17.777
I THOUGHT I WAS
IN LOVE WITH HER.

23:17.845 --> 23:23.016
BUT-BUT I REALIZE NOW IT WAS BECAUSE
THINGS WEREN'T GOING WELL AT HOME, AND...

23:24.018 --> 23:26.853
NOW THAT'S GONE, TOO.

23:28.256 --> 23:31.524
YOU ARE ONE SWEET...

23:31.592 --> 23:34.527
CREEPY LITTLE DUDE.

23:34.595 --> 23:38.081
HEY, IF YOU WANNA MOVE
IN WITH ME, THAT'S COOL.

23:38.149 --> 23:39.433
REALLY?

23:39.500 --> 23:40.917
YOU MEAN IT?

23:40.985 --> 23:43.336
HELL TO THE YEAH!

23:43.404 --> 23:46.339
I KNOW I MESS
WITH YOU A LOT, BUT...

23:46.407 --> 23:50.744
THE TRUTH IS I LOVE YOU MORE
THAN ANY OF MY OTHER FRIENDS.

23:50.811 --> 23:52.696
WELL, THANKS, DOUG.

23:52.763 --> 23:56.366
I- YOU KNOW, Y-YOU'VE ALWAYS
BEEN KIND OF A HERO TO ME.

23:56.434 --> 23:58.068
I AM NOT A HERO!

23:58.136 --> 23:58.968
I'LL KILL YOU!

23:59.036 --> 24:01.521
OK, I DIDN'T-

24:01.589 --> 24:03.556
I DIDN'T
MEAN ANYTHING BY IT.

24:03.624 --> 24:05.308
AND NOW I LOVE YOU.

24:05.376 --> 24:06.943
COME ON.
LET'S WRESTLE.

24:09.413 --> 24:13.684
AW, KEL, I CAN'T BELIEVE
I SCREWED EVERYTHING UP.

24:13.751 --> 24:17.754
ONE MOMENT OF WEAKNESS, AND I
LOST MY HUSBAND, MY MING MEl.

24:20.057 --> 24:21.124
HE REALLY
WON'T FORGIVE YOU?

24:21.192 --> 24:22.860
NO, AND WHO CAN
BLAME HIM?

24:22.927 --> 24:24.561
I MEAN,
I DIDN'T SHOW HIM

24:24.628 --> 24:25.729
THE COMMITMENT
HE DESERVES,

24:25.796 --> 24:27.164
AND THAT IS JUST
UNFORGIVABLE.

24:27.232 --> 24:30.000
YEAH, WELL, HE'S LET YOU DOWN
LOTS OF TIMES.

24:30.068 --> 24:31.351
YEAH, BUT NOTHING
LIKE THIS.

24:31.419 --> 24:33.286
WHAT ABOUT WHEN HE
FAKED A HEART ATTACK

24:33.354 --> 24:36.205
BECAUSE HE FORGOT
YOUR BOSS' NAME?

24:37.975 --> 24:39.442
THAT WASN'T A BIG DEAL.

24:39.510 --> 24:43.713
WHAT ABOUT WHEN HE USED YOUR TAX
REFUND TO BUY AN ICE-CREAM TRUCK?

24:43.781 --> 24:45.715
YEAH, BUT THAT
WAS MY FAULT.

24:45.783 --> 24:48.384
I SHOULDN'T HAVE LEFT
THE CHECK LYING AROUND.

24:48.452 --> 24:52.388
WHAT ABOUT WHEN YOU HAD TO
CANCEL YOUR BIRTHDAY TRIP TO PARIS

24:52.456 --> 24:56.693
BECAUSE HE WAS A SEMIFINALIST
IN A BLADDER BUST CONTEST?

24:56.761 --> 24:59.363
YEAH, THAT WAS
A KICK IN THE CHICLETS.

24:59.430 --> 25:01.481
FOLKS, WE HAVE A VERY
SPECIAL TREAT FOR YOU TONIGHT.

25:01.548 --> 25:04.601
OUR BEAUTIFUL BRIDE IS GONNA SING
ONE OF HER HIT RECORDS FOR US.

25:04.669 --> 25:06.052
SO PLEASE WELCOME
TO THE STAGE

25:06.070 --> 25:08.387
THE VERY LOVELY AND TALENTED
AVA ST. CLAIR.

25:09.674 --> 25:13.042
I- I'M NOT AVA ST. CLAIR.

25:13.110 --> 25:15.145
I'M NOT CLIFF ROBERTSON,
BUT THAT DIDN'T STOP ME

25:15.213 --> 25:17.314
FROM SIGNING MY MEALS
TO HIS HOTEL ROOM.

25:17.382 --> 25:18.615
NOW GET UP THERE.

25:19.917 --> 25:22.469
SO WOULD YOU CARE
FOR GARDEN OR CAESAR?

25:22.536 --> 25:23.803
UH, GARDEN SALAD,
PLEASE.

25:23.871 --> 25:27.174
AND WOULD YOU KNOW IF
THERE'S ANYONE SITTING THERE?

25:27.241 --> 25:29.175
YEAH, MY HUSBAND.
HEH HEH.

25:29.243 --> 25:31.845
I MEAN, OF COURSE
I HAVE A HUSBAND.

25:31.912 --> 25:32.846
LOOK AT ME.

25:34.581 --> 25:38.769
OF COURSE. DO YOU KNOW IF HE
WOULD LIKE GARDEN OR CAESAR?

25:38.836 --> 25:40.971
CAESAR.

25:41.039 --> 25:43.557
HOLLY, IT'S SO GOOD
TO SEE YOU.

25:43.624 --> 25:44.891
HI, LOU.

25:44.959 --> 25:46.059
SUCH A HAPPY DAY.

25:46.126 --> 25:47.694
OH, GOD.

25:59.390 --> 26:02.326
THIS IS PORNOGRAPHIC.

26:12.337 --> 26:13.987
AAH!

26:14.055 --> 26:15.521
OHH! AAH!

26:15.589 --> 26:18.658
THAT-THAT'S 11-4, ME.

26:18.726 --> 26:20.327
LET'S GO.
HANDS AND KNEES.

26:20.394 --> 26:22.662
NO, I'M NOT WRESTLING
WITH YOU ANYMORE.

26:22.730 --> 26:24.664
YOU DON'T RESPECT
MY SAFE WORD.

26:24.732 --> 26:26.566
SUCH A BABY.

26:26.633 --> 26:29.635
HEY, HOLLY.
I'M DRUNK. ARE YOU?

26:29.703 --> 26:30.403
NO.

26:30.471 --> 26:33.857
WELL, A LITTLE.

26:33.924 --> 26:35.409
HEY, HOL.
HOW'S IT GOIN'?

26:35.476 --> 26:36.576
GREAT. GREAT.

26:36.644 --> 26:37.828
MY HUSBAND
JUST LEFT ME,

26:37.895 --> 26:41.331
AND I'M ABOUT TO HAVE A BABY
WITH NO JOB AND NO MONEY,

26:41.398 --> 26:42.966
BUT OTHER THAN THAT,
REAL GOOD.

26:43.034 --> 26:44.534
I'M SPLITTIN' UP
WITH CARRIE.

26:44.602 --> 26:46.402
YOU WANNA MOVE IN
WITH ME?

26:46.470 --> 26:50.290
REALLY?
OH, MY GOD. YES. YES.

26:50.357 --> 26:53.176
NO, NO. YOU-WAIT. YOU SAID
I COULD MOVE IN WITH YOU.

26:53.243 --> 26:55.478
DID I? YOU'RE OUT.
HOLLY'S IN.

26:55.546 --> 26:58.815
DOUG, I-I CAN'T BELIEVE HOW
KIND AND GENEROUS YOU'RE BEING.

26:58.883 --> 27:01.785
I MEAN, HONESTLY, I DIDN'T EVEN
THINK YOU LIKED ME THAT MUCH.

27:01.853 --> 27:06.022
NO. TRUTH IS, I MEAN, I LOVE YOU
MORE THAN ANY OF MY OTHER FRIENDS.

27:06.090 --> 27:08.058
OH, MY GOD.

27:08.126 --> 27:09.726
DOUG, I'M-THANK YOU.

27:09.793 --> 27:12.078
I REALLY NEEDED TO HEAR
SOMETHING LIKE THAT RIGHT NOW.

27:12.146 --> 27:13.063
OH, NO PROBLEM.

27:13.131 --> 27:15.048
COME ON.
LET'S WRESTLE.

27:26.110 --> 27:28.544
CARRIE,
HE SOLD YOUR HAIR.

27:28.612 --> 27:30.213
UH-HUH. UH-HUH.

27:30.281 --> 27:31.614
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

27:31.682 --> 27:33.916
NOW IF I COULD HAVE YOUR
ATTENTION, IT'S TIME FOR THE TOAST.

27:33.984 --> 27:36.052
TOASTING OUR GROOM,
ARTHUR SPOONER,

27:36.119 --> 27:39.238
IS HIS BEST MAN AND
SON-IN-LAW, DOUG HEFFERNAN.

27:51.802 --> 27:53.836
HOLLY, HAVE YOU
SEEN DOUGLAS?

27:53.904 --> 27:56.472
HE FELL ASLEEP
WHEN WE WERE WRESTLING.

27:58.242 --> 28:00.543
WELL, AT LEAST YOU WEREN'T
UNDER HIM WHEN IT HAPPENED.

28:00.611 --> 28:03.479
THAT WAS 6 OF THE MOST
TERRIFYING HOURS OF MY LIFE.

28:07.318 --> 28:09.619
SPENCE, CONGRATULATIONS.
YOU'RE MY NEW BEST MAN.

28:09.687 --> 28:12.389
NOW GET UP THERE
AND TOAST ME, KID.

28:12.457 --> 28:13.990
I DON'T FEEL LIKE IT,
ARTHUR.

28:14.057 --> 28:16.058
I'M HAVING
A VERY ROUGH NIGHT.

28:16.126 --> 28:18.561
I'M YOUR FATHER.
I COMMAND YOU TO TOAST ME.

28:20.080 --> 28:23.783
I'LL TOAST WHO I WANT
WHEN I WANT.

28:23.851 --> 28:25.886
<i>YOU GOT THAT, DAD?</i>

28:25.953 --> 28:28.188
THIS ISN'T OVER.

28:31.275 --> 28:32.875
HEY, UH, HEH.

28:32.943 --> 28:35.979
LIKE THE WAY YOU STOOD UP TO HIM THERE.

28:36.046 --> 28:37.814
OH, THANKS. THANKS.

28:37.881 --> 28:39.883
YOU KNOW, KIND OF
REMINDED ME OF THE WAY

28:39.951 --> 28:42.552
YOU STOOD UP TO OUR LANDLORD
ABOUT THAT ROACH PROBLEM.

28:42.620 --> 28:46.456
OH. WELL, THE LEASE CLEARLY STATES
WHEN THERE'S MORE THAN A THOUSAND,

28:46.524 --> 28:48.225
IT'S HIS RESPONSIBILITY.

28:48.292 --> 28:49.975
YOU SEE, I WOULDN'T
HAVE KNOWN THAT.

28:50.043 --> 28:52.878
<i>HEY, DID YOU SEE AMERICA'S
NEXT TOP MODEL THIS WEEK?</i>

28:52.946 --> 28:55.715
YES! CAN YOU BELIEVE IT
CAME DOWN TO MARQUESA AND LISI?

28:55.783 --> 28:59.452
I KNOW! I MEAN, IT'S SO OBVIOUS
WHO'S GONNA WIN THIS THING.

28:59.519 --> 29:00.653
DUH. MARQUESA.
MARQUESA.

29:00.721 --> 29:02.622
HA HA HA HA HA!

29:02.690 --> 29:04.073
MARQUESA. EWW.

29:04.142 --> 29:06.976
LISI'S WAY BETTER
FOR COUTURE.

29:11.348 --> 29:13.766
COME ON, DANNY. LET'S
GO HOME. I'M BORED.

29:13.834 --> 29:17.036
ALL RIGHT. WHY DON'T YOU,
UH, GO GRAB YOUR JACKET?

29:17.104 --> 29:19.038
I'LL BE RIGHT WITH YOU.
OK.

29:20.140 --> 29:22.075
SORRY ABOUT THE WHOLE
MARQUESA THING.

29:22.142 --> 29:23.410
IT'S COOL.
IT'S COOL.

29:24.912 --> 29:27.180
WELL, I GUESS SHE'S
WAITIN' FOR ME.

29:27.248 --> 29:28.348
BETTER TAKE OFF.

29:28.416 --> 29:30.417
YEAH. SEE YOU
AT THE ALLERGIST'S.

29:32.920 --> 29:34.804
I DON'T EVEN
KNOW YOU THAT WELL.

29:34.872 --> 29:37.723
I'M A CRUSTY CURMUDGEON
WITH A HEART OF GOLD.

29:37.791 --> 29:38.824
NOW GO!

29:44.698 --> 29:48.768
HI. UH, I'LL NEVER FORGET
THE FIRST TIME I MET ARTHUR.

29:48.836 --> 29:51.788
I WAS, UH, SITTING IN THE
HEFFERNAN LIVING ROOM, WATCHING TV.

29:51.855 --> 29:54.457
UH, ARTHUR CAME IN,
AND WHEN HE SAW ME,

29:54.525 --> 29:58.895
HE BEGGED ME NOT TO HURT HIM,
THEN RAN OFF TO CALL THE POLICE.

29:58.962 --> 30:01.497
HA HA HA HA HA!

30:01.565 --> 30:03.066
HOO!

30:03.133 --> 30:05.535
AND, HELLO, REMEMBER
THAT TIME YOUR APPENDIX BURST

30:05.602 --> 30:07.537
AND HE WOULDN'T
LEAVE WORK EARLY?

30:07.604 --> 30:10.973
HE DID LEAVE WORK EARLY
TO GO TO THE RODEO.

30:12.743 --> 30:14.210
THAT'S IT.

30:14.278 --> 30:15.528
I JUST-I THINK
YOU'LL FEEL BETTER

30:15.596 --> 30:17.630
IF YOU HAVE A LITTLE
SOMETHING TO EAT.

30:17.698 --> 30:19.599
I'LL GET YOU
MY HUSBAND'S PRIME RIB.

30:19.666 --> 30:20.933
OH. THANK YOU, SPENCE.

30:23.937 --> 30:27.373
YOU KNOW, YOU REALLY
HAD ME GOIN' OUT THERE, DOUG.

30:27.441 --> 30:28.658
"I TOOK A LEAP OF FAITH
FOR YOU.

30:28.726 --> 30:30.293
YOU DIDN'T TAKE
A LEAP OF FAITH FOR ME."

30:30.361 --> 30:31.928
DO YOU KNOW HOW MANY TIMES
IN OUR MARRIAGE

30:31.996 --> 30:34.164
YOU HAVE SCREWED ME OVER
TO DO WHAT YOU WANTED TO DO?

30:34.232 --> 30:36.816
AW, HERE WE GO
WITH THE RODEO AGAIN.

30:36.883 --> 30:39.552
IT COMES TO TOWN
ONCE A YEAR!

30:39.620 --> 30:42.072
IT WASN'T JUST THAT, DOUG.
IT WAS MANY OTHER THINGS,

30:42.139 --> 30:43.673
AND I FORGAVE YOU
FOR EVERYTHING,

30:43.740 --> 30:46.276
SO YOU DAMN WELL BETTER
FORGIVE ME FOR THIS.

30:46.343 --> 30:49.212
YOU DON'T TELL ME WHAT I
BETTER DAMN WELL BETTER DO.

30:49.279 --> 30:50.580
OK, YOU KNOW WHAT?

30:50.647 --> 30:52.832
DO WHATEVER YOU WANNA DO,
BUT LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING.

30:52.900 --> 30:54.534
I LOVE THIS BABY,
AND I WANT HER,

30:54.601 --> 30:56.369
AND I AM GONNA GET HER
FOR MYSELF.

30:56.436 --> 30:58.889
OH, NO. NO, NO, NO, 'CAUSE
I WANTED A BABY FIRST, OK?

30:58.956 --> 31:01.591
SO IF ANYBODY'S GONNA GET
THE BABY, IT'S GONNA BE ME.

31:01.658 --> 31:02.775
OH, YOU REALLY
THINK SO, BUTCH?

31:02.843 --> 31:05.344
WELL, I'M ON MY WAY TO CHINA
RIGHT NOW TO GET HER.

31:05.412 --> 31:07.897
YEAH? NOT IF I
GET THERE FIRST.

31:10.417 --> 31:12.902
I'M GONNA GET THERE FIRST.

31:12.970 --> 31:14.237
WHOA.

31:22.313 --> 31:27.199
AND THEN THERE WAS THE TIME
ARTHUR THOUGHT I WAS EDDIE MURPHY.

31:27.267 --> 31:27.967
HEY, WE GOTTA GO.

31:28.119 --> 31:29.469
GO. GO WHERE?

31:29.537 --> 31:30.954
TO CHINA TO GET
MY BABY. COME ON.

31:31.021 --> 31:32.655
ACTUALLY, YOU CAN JUST
DROP ME AT THE AIRPORT

31:32.723 --> 31:33.823
IF YOU DON'T WANNA
COME WITH.

31:33.891 --> 31:35.257
UH, SURE.

31:35.325 --> 31:37.227
LET'S ALL TOAST
ARTHUR SPOONER, A GREAT GUY

31:37.294 --> 31:39.362
WHO'S A LITTLE RACIST.

31:41.832 --> 31:44.183
DOUG, SHOULD I MOVE IN AFTER
YOU GET BACK FROM CHINA OR-

31:44.251 --> 31:47.270
HEY, HOLLY! GLAD TO SEE
YOU COULD MAKE IT.

31:49.573 --> 31:52.642
WELL, I GUESS I'M
BACK OUT ON THE STREET.

31:52.709 --> 31:56.162
WELL, SEEING AS YOU AND I
ARE IN THE SAME SITUATION,

31:56.229 --> 31:58.397
DO YOU WANNA
GET A PLACE TOGETHER?

31:58.465 --> 32:00.233
REALLY?
YOU MEAN IT?

32:00.300 --> 32:03.937
OH, OF COURSE. I-I WOULD
LIKE NOTHING BETTER THAN...

32:05.689 --> 32:06.906
YOU FORGET SOMETHING?

32:06.973 --> 32:08.307
YEAH.

32:08.375 --> 32:11.310
I FORGOT MY ROOMMATE.

32:13.814 --> 32:15.982
W- WAIT. YOU AND I
WERE GONNA-

32:16.049 --> 32:18.584
YEAH, THAT'S NOT
GONNA WORK OUT.

32:31.131 --> 32:33.950
WELL, YOU KNOW, IF THINGS
WORK OUT BETWEEN US,

32:34.018 --> 32:35.417
YOU'LL HAVE TO CONVERT.

32:35.485 --> 32:38.137
OF COURSE I WILL.

32:38.204 --> 32:40.022
TO WHAT?

32:49.416 --> 32:50.950
I'LL JUST GET
MY PASSPORT,

32:51.017 --> 32:53.753
AND THEN WE'LL
GET THE HELL OUT OF HERE.

32:53.821 --> 32:55.171
DOUG, YOU'VE NEVER
BEEN OUT OF AMERICA.

32:55.239 --> 32:55.971
WHY DO YOU EVEN
HAVE A PASSPORT?

32:56.123 --> 32:58.992
I HEARD THEY STILL
HAD THE McRIB IN CANADA.

33:00.611 --> 33:03.796
OH, HEY. OFF TO CHINA.
DON'T WAIT UP.

33:03.863 --> 33:05.064
HEY! DID YOU TAKE
MY PASSPORT?

33:05.132 --> 33:07.050
OH, NO, BABE,
IT'S STILL HERE...

33:07.117 --> 33:08.851
SOMEWHERE.

33:12.089 --> 33:14.057
WHERE THE HELL DID SHE HIDE
THIS FREAKIN' PASSPORT?

33:14.124 --> 33:15.191
DEAC. DID YOU FIND IT?

33:15.259 --> 33:16.326
NOT YET.

33:16.394 --> 33:17.827
WELL, KEEP LOOKIN',
OKAY?

33:17.895 --> 33:20.663
THE LAST FLIGHT FOR CHINA
LEAVES IN 2 HOURS.

33:20.731 --> 33:22.499
OH, MAN!

33:22.566 --> 33:24.467
OH, LOOK AT THIS.
A THOUSAND CHOPSTICKS.

33:24.535 --> 33:26.068
IT'S LIKE A CRUEL JOKE.

33:28.372 --> 33:29.789
NO LUCK, GUY.
I LOOKED EVERYWHERE.

33:29.857 --> 33:31.791
<i>BUT I DID FIND THIS
FIRST-SEASON DVD OF DEADWOOD.</i>

33:31.859 --> 33:34.560
MIND IF I
- OH, JUST TAKE IT, WOULD YOU?

33:34.628 --> 33:36.746
TAKE ANYTHING YOU WANT.

33:39.717 --> 33:41.217
I- I'M GOOD WITH THIS.

33:42.919 --> 33:44.671
IT'S OVER, DEAC.

33:44.738 --> 33:46.673
SHE WON.

33:46.740 --> 33:49.108
SHE WON THE BABY.

33:49.176 --> 33:50.759
I'M SORRY, MAN.

33:51.795 --> 33:53.362
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO NOW?

33:53.430 --> 33:55.331
I DON'T KNOW.
EAT, I GUESS.

34:07.511 --> 34:09.212
HELLO.

34:10.380 --> 34:12.348
YOU FOUND IT?

34:12.416 --> 34:16.601
GOTTA ADMIT THE VEGETABLE
CRISPER WAS AN INSPIRED CHOICE.

34:16.670 --> 34:19.121
BUT YOU'VE NEVER GONE IN
THAT DRAWER YOUR WHOLE LIFE.

34:19.188 --> 34:20.856
YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW
IT EXISTS.

34:20.924 --> 34:23.192
BUT DEACON DOES.

34:23.260 --> 34:25.293
HIS B.L.T.
WAS DELICIOUS,

34:25.362 --> 34:27.630
AS IS MY REVENGE.

34:46.132 --> 34:47.800
DOUG.
HMM?

34:47.868 --> 34:49.552
DOUG.

34:52.088 --> 34:55.306
OH, GOD.

34:55.375 --> 34:56.775
WHAT?

34:56.842 --> 34:58.077
SO WHAT'S
OUR ENDGAME HERE?

34:58.145 --> 35:00.546
WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO
WHEN WE LAND?

35:00.614 --> 35:04.450
WE GONNA RACE THROUGH THE STREETS
OF BEIJING TO THE ADOPTION AGENCY?

35:04.517 --> 35:06.085
I DON'T KNOW.

35:06.153 --> 35:09.154
BECAUSE IF WE HAVE TO
TAKE RICKSHAWS, YOU'LL LOSE.

35:12.058 --> 35:13.843
NOT IF IT'S DOWNHILL.

35:17.731 --> 35:19.349
WHAT HAPPENED HERE?

35:19.416 --> 35:21.534
I DON'T KNOW.

35:21.601 --> 35:25.171
YOU KNOW, WHEN MY, UH...

35:25.238 --> 35:28.174
WHEN MY MOM DIED
WHEN I WAS A KID,

35:28.241 --> 35:32.712
IT FELT LIKE I WAS NOTHING,
YOU KNOW, LIKE I HAD NO LIFE.

35:32.780 --> 35:36.999
MY DAD DID HIS BEST
TO BE A GOOD PARENT, BUT...

35:37.067 --> 35:39.068
WHO WE KIDDIN'?

35:39.135 --> 35:43.439
ANYWAY, ON-ON SUNDAYS,
HE USED TO TAKE ME

35:43.506 --> 35:45.607
TO THIS PARK
ON VERNON BOULEVARD,

35:45.675 --> 35:47.710
RIGHT ON THE EAST RIVER,

35:47.777 --> 35:50.379
WHERE YOU COULD LOOK ACROSS
AND SEE MANHATTAN.

35:51.648 --> 35:54.350
AND WHILE HE WAS, UH, OFF

35:54.417 --> 35:57.720
HANDING OUT LEAFLETS
OR CHASING SQUIRRELS,

35:57.787 --> 36:00.056
I WOULD JUST STAND
AT THE RAILING,

36:00.123 --> 36:03.459
AND I WOULD LOOK AT THE
BEAUTIFUL APARTMENT BUILDINGS

36:03.526 --> 36:07.696
ACROSS THE RIVER, AND I-
I WOULD IMAGINE THIS GREAT LIFE

36:07.764 --> 36:12.034
THAT I MIGHT HAVE SOMEDAY ACTUALLY
LIVING IN ONE OF THEM, YOU KNOW,

36:12.102 --> 36:15.804
WITH A GREAT JOB AS A FASHION
DESIGNER FOR SERGIO VALENTE

36:15.873 --> 36:20.176
OR GOIN' TO STUDIO 54
EVERY NIGHT.

36:20.244 --> 36:22.111
GOD, I'M OLD.

36:23.413 --> 36:26.482
BUT THEN I GREW UP,
AND REALITY SET IN,

36:26.550 --> 36:29.185
AND THE DREAM GOT PUT AWAY.

36:29.252 --> 36:31.754
AND THEN I MET YOU,

36:31.822 --> 36:34.473
AND I WAS-

36:34.541 --> 36:38.510
I WAS HAPPY IN A WHOLE...

36:38.578 --> 36:42.097
NEW WAY I JUST-
I NEVER IMAGINED.

36:44.768 --> 36:48.671
I MEAN, I WAS...

36:48.739 --> 36:53.609
IN THAT APARTMENT
- I MEAN, I GUESS JUST DREAMS STICK WITH YOU, BECAUSE...

36:53.677 --> 36:59.882
I JUST-I FELT
LIKE CARRIE AGAIN, YOU KNOW,

36:59.950 --> 37:06.155
LITTLE CARRIE FINALLY HAVING THE
THING SHE WANTED BACK THEN, AND...

37:06.222 --> 37:09.659
AT THE MOMENT I SHOULD
HAVE GIVEN IT UP, I-

37:09.726 --> 37:12.428
I COULDN'T, YOU KNOW,
BECAUSE IT WAS LIKE...

37:12.496 --> 37:14.764
I WAS TAKING SOMETHING
AWAY FROM HER.

37:14.832 --> 37:17.600
YOU KNOW, DOES THAT
MAKE ANY SENSE, DOUG?

37:17.668 --> 37:18.518
YEAH.

37:18.669 --> 37:23.039
IT'S FUNNY
TO HEAR YOU SAY THAT,

37:23.107 --> 37:25.108
'CAUSE ALL THESE YEARS,

37:25.175 --> 37:28.511
EVEN WHEN THINGS
WERE GOOD WITH US,

37:28.578 --> 37:32.748
I JUST STILL SENSED
THERE WAS SOMETHING...

37:32.816 --> 37:35.251
PULLING YOU
AWAY FROM ME,

37:35.318 --> 37:38.587
YOU KNOW, LIKE THIS
LITTLE VOICE INSIDE SAYING,

37:38.656 --> 37:40.589
"WANNA BE IN MANHATTAN.

37:40.658 --> 37:43.693
I WANNA BE
IN MANHATTAN."

37:43.761 --> 37:46.362
PLUS, YOU SAID IT
OUT LOUD A LOT.

37:49.049 --> 37:50.833
I DI-I DID.

37:50.901 --> 37:53.636
I DID HEAR THAT VOICE
EVERY DAY.

37:53.704 --> 37:57.056
AND NOW I JUST HEAR HER,
HER VOICE SAYING...

37:58.942 --> 38:01.511
WHATEVER CHINESE BABIES
SAY, AND-

38:06.082 --> 38:08.351
AND I WANT HER.

38:08.419 --> 38:11.788
AND I-I WANT YOU.

38:11.855 --> 38:16.475
AND I-I WISH THAT WE COULD JUST
PUT THIS ALL BEHIND US, YOU KNOW,

38:16.542 --> 38:19.411
AND JUST BE A FAMILY.

38:22.466 --> 38:24.500
I LOVE YOU, CARRIE.

38:24.568 --> 38:26.735
I LOVE YOU, TOO.

38:30.674 --> 38:32.342
OH, GOD.

38:32.409 --> 38:35.345
NO, HE'S GOTTA GET UP.
HE'S GOTTA GET UP.

38:39.983 --> 38:42.351
HI, MING MEl.

38:42.419 --> 38:45.471
MING MEl HEFFERNAN.

38:45.538 --> 38:46.738
YOU KNOW WHAT?

38:46.806 --> 38:49.141
IT WORKS.

38:49.209 --> 38:50.960
COME ON, HONEY.
WE GOTTA GO TO THE AIRPORT.

38:51.028 --> 38:52.394
JUST A SECOND.

38:52.462 --> 38:55.547
MOMMY AND I ARE GONNA
TAKE YOU BACK HOME TO QUEENS.

38:55.615 --> 38:57.583
YOU'RE GONNA LOVE QUEENS.

38:57.651 --> 38:59.484
QUEENS HAS GOT
THE NEW YORK METS.

38:59.552 --> 39:00.703
IT'S GOT-

39:00.821 --> 39:03.189
WELL, NOT A LOT ELSE,
ACTUALLY.

39:03.256 --> 39:06.658
USED TO HAVE PASTRAMI KING,
BUT THEY SHUT THAT DOWN.

39:06.726 --> 39:08.260
NOW IT'S A BOOKSTORE.

39:08.328 --> 39:11.063
TELL YOU, THE WORLD
IS A CRAZY PLACE.

39:11.931 --> 39:15.618
OOH. SHE SMILED AT ME.

39:15.685 --> 39:17.353
EITHER THAT,
OR SHE'S POOPIN'.

39:17.420 --> 39:20.056
OR MAYBE BOTH.
MAYBE SHE JUST REALLY ENJOYS-

39:20.124 --> 39:21.624
I'M PREGNANT.

39:21.692 --> 39:24.276
POOPING.

39:24.344 --> 39:25.377
WHAT?

39:25.396 --> 39:27.797
YEAH. I HAVEN'T FELT
WELL SINCE WE LANDED,

39:27.865 --> 39:29.732
AND I BOUGHT
A PREGNANCY TEST

39:29.800 --> 39:32.001
IN THE DRUG STORE
IN THE LOBBY,

39:32.068 --> 39:34.270
AND WE'RE GONNA
HAVE A BABY.

39:34.337 --> 39:36.889
WELL, WHAT DO WE DO
WITH THIS ONE?

39:38.258 --> 39:39.976
I DON'T KNOW.

39:40.043 --> 39:42.594
I THINK I'M HAVING
AN ANXIETY ATTACK.

39:42.662 --> 39:44.380
C- CALM DOWN.
A- ARE YOU SURE?

39:44.448 --> 39:46.582
YES, I AM SURE.

39:46.649 --> 39:48.084
I MEAN, LOOK.

39:48.151 --> 39:51.753
WH-WHAT MEANS PREGNANT,
THE MONKEY OR THE DRAGON?

39:51.821 --> 39:52.905
THAT'S JUST DECORATIVE.

39:52.973 --> 39:55.007
LOOK, IT CAME OUT BLUE.
THAT MEANS I'M PREGNANT.

39:55.075 --> 39:57.009
IT MUST HAVE HAPPENED
IN THE APARTMENT THAT NIGHT.

39:57.077 --> 39:58.660
OH, MY GOD.
OH, MY GOD. OH, MY GOD.

39:58.728 --> 40:00.312
I THOUGHT THE DOCTOR SAID
YOU COULDN'T GET PREGNANT.

40:00.380 --> 40:02.781
NO, SHE SAID WE PROBABLY
COULDN'T. IT HAPPENS ALL THE TIME.

40:02.849 --> 40:05.217
WHEN COUPLES DON'T THINK THEY CAN
GET PREGNANT, THEY STOP TRYING,

40:05.285 --> 40:07.286
AND THEN THEY ADOPT A BABY AND
- OH, GOD.

40:07.354 --> 40:08.838
CARRIE, YOU HAVE
TO CALM DOWN.

40:08.906 --> 40:10.439
I CAN'T CALM DOWN, DOUG.

40:10.507 --> 40:12.258
YESTERDAY I HAD
NO HUSBAND, NO BABY,

40:12.325 --> 40:16.161
AND TODAY I HAVE A HUSBAND
AND 2 BABIES, AND I'M IN CHINA.

40:16.229 --> 40:18.497
THAT'S A LOT OF CHANGE
FOR ONE DAY.

40:18.564 --> 40:20.132
WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO?

40:20.200 --> 40:22.351
I- I'LL TELL YOU
WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO.

40:22.418 --> 40:24.070
WE'RE GONNA
FLY HOME TODAY,

40:24.137 --> 40:27.073
AND WE'RE GONNA START
OUR NEW LIFE AS PARENTS

40:27.140 --> 40:30.943
OF 2 BEAUTIFUL,
WONDERFUL CHILDREN...

40:31.011 --> 40:33.863
WITH VERY
DIFFERENT-SHAPED EYES.

40:35.599 --> 40:37.265
EVERYTHING'S
GONNA BE FINE.

40:37.333 --> 40:39.502
T- TRUST ME.

40:39.569 --> 40:41.871
EVERYTHING'S
GONNA BE FINE.

40:48.995 --> 40:49.962
MING MEl.
MING MEl.

40:50.030 --> 40:51.163
IT'S OK.
OHH.

40:51.231 --> 40:52.465
IT'S ALL RIGHT, BABY.
CALM DOWN.

40:52.532 --> 40:53.883
IT'S ALL RIGHT, BABY.

40:53.950 --> 40:55.084
ALL RIGHT.

40:55.152 --> 40:56.452
NO, I KNOW-

40:56.519 --> 40:58.221
THERE YOU GO.
GOOD GIRL.

40:58.288 --> 41:01.123
