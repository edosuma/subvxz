00:09.844 --> 00:11.804
[Camille]
Your laptop had my Instagram,

00:11.804 --> 00:13.097
my hobbies, my schedule.

00:13.097 --> 00:15.516
Everything we did
last night you researched.

00:15.516 --> 00:17.727
Do you not get
how stalkery this is?

00:17.727 --> 00:18.936
It ain't even like that, Cam.

00:18.936 --> 00:20.521
I'm just terrible
at planning dates.

00:20.521 --> 00:22.440
It's like the one thing
I'm bad at.

00:22.440 --> 00:24.316
If you do say so yourself,
and you know what?

00:24.316 --> 00:25.234
By the way, you're bad
at other things,

00:25.234 --> 00:26.277
like being honest.

00:26.277 --> 00:27.611
What?

00:27.611 --> 00:29.530
Pretending that you ran
into me at Red Lobster,

00:29.530 --> 00:30.823
that was dishonest.

00:30.823 --> 00:33.451
Guessing that I'm a Gemini,
dishonest.

00:33.451 --> 00:35.578
Oh, now he likes video games,
dishonest!

00:35.578 --> 00:37.913
Okay, okay,
but it wasn't lying, lying.

00:37.913 --> 00:40.666
It was more, you know,
reconnaissance, right?

00:40.666 --> 00:42.668
I was just trying
to impress you.

00:42.668 --> 00:44.795
Oh no, you were trying
to manipulate me

00:44.795 --> 00:45.963
to get me into bed

00:45.963 --> 00:47.423
by pretending that
we had things in common.

00:47.423 --> 00:49.467
No, a lot of them
turned out to be real.

00:49.467 --> 00:52.261
Do you not get the part of me
that will always now wonder

00:52.261 --> 00:54.054
what is real
and what's for show?

00:54.054 --> 00:55.806
And why would you go through
all of that anyways

00:55.806 --> 00:57.099
before you even knew me?

00:57.099 --> 00:58.684
Because that piece you wrote
for The Root

00:58.684 --> 01:01.645
about gentrification
was dope, okay?

01:01.645 --> 01:04.023
And then, yes, I looked you up,
and I thought you were cute.

01:04.023 --> 01:05.524
Suddenly, you're on the panel,

01:05.524 --> 01:07.985
and so I did
a little Instagram deep dive,

01:07.985 --> 01:10.029
and I rolled the dice
with Red Lobster.

01:10.029 --> 01:11.530
Hello, stalking.

01:11.530 --> 01:12.782
I mean,
it's like I'm basically waiting

01:12.782 --> 01:14.283
to be murdered at this point.

01:14.283 --> 01:16.952
Well, I had you in a lot
of remote locations last night,

01:16.952 --> 01:19.497
so if murder was my intent,
it would have happened.

01:19.497 --> 01:20.956
Good to know.

01:20.956 --> 01:23.000
That was supposed
to be a joke.

01:23.000 --> 01:25.836
Trust me, this is a joke,
and I don't have time for it.

01:25.836 --> 01:28.506
Because of this, I missed
a really important meeting.

01:28.506 --> 01:30.841
So I'm just gonna go
before the doors close

01:30.841 --> 01:32.301
and lock themselves
or something.

01:32.301 --> 01:34.428
[singer]

01:34.428 --> 01:37.765
[singer]

01:37.765 --> 01:41.519
or you coming in third...

01:41.519 --> 01:44.480
[Camille]
Dr. Pruitt, Dr. Pruitt!

01:44.480 --> 01:46.023
I was just in your office.

01:46.023 --> 01:48.192
Fun.
I was in my office

01:48.192 --> 01:49.735
at our appointed meeting time.

01:49.735 --> 01:50.653
I am very sorry.

01:50.653 --> 01:51.987
If I could just explain...

01:51.987 --> 01:55.115
Camille, there are two things
I cannot abide.

01:55.115 --> 01:56.617
One is lateness,

01:56.617 --> 01:58.953
and the other is
inappropriate cleavage

01:58.953 --> 02:00.871
in the workplace.

02:00.871 --> 02:03.457
Boom, boom, guilty two times.

02:03.457 --> 02:05.501
This is completely
not like me.

02:05.501 --> 02:06.669
I am on time for everything.

02:06.669 --> 02:10.506
I was even born
three weeks early.

02:10.506 --> 02:13.759
Please, I promise
that I can prove my worth

02:13.759 --> 02:15.261
on your Seneca Village
research team.

02:15.261 --> 02:16.971
Well, you get the opportunity
to prove that

02:16.971 --> 02:19.390
in your new role
as second assistant.

02:19.390 --> 02:22.685
And I suppose that
groveling is beneath me?

02:22.685 --> 02:25.104
I don't know if it is,
but it probably won't work.

02:25.104 --> 02:27.523
Who got my position
as first assistant?

02:27.523 --> 02:31.485
The one that wasn't late,
Nora Longbone.

02:31.485 --> 02:34.405
My student Nora?
But she's an undergrad.

02:34.405 --> 02:36.156
Yes, with lots of potential.

02:36.156 --> 02:39.243
How is assisting my student
even gonna work?

02:39.243 --> 02:41.829
You'd have to show up
on time to find out.

02:41.829 --> 02:43.247
You know, Camille,

02:43.247 --> 02:46.041
I am not gonna be doing you
any special favors.

02:46.041 --> 02:50.004
If you really want this job,
you gotta work for it.

02:50.004 --> 02:53.340
Yeah, I will.

02:53.340 --> 02:56.260
And if that's you I smell,
you need to take a shower.

02:56.260 --> 02:58.345
[singer]

03:00.556 --> 03:02.683
in the gym all week...

03:02.683 --> 03:08.689
Who knew that a photo shoot
would be such an aphrodisiac?

03:09.857 --> 03:12.526
Who knew I would be back
in your bed again?

03:12.526 --> 03:16.071
And for the record,
sex after actually meeting you

03:16.071 --> 03:17.656
is even better
than the first time.

03:17.656 --> 03:19.366
Ditto.

03:19.366 --> 03:21.285
Now, if you'll excuse me,

03:21.285 --> 03:23.829
I have to go reheat some food
on my way out.

03:23.829 --> 03:26.248
Such a bitch move.

03:26.248 --> 03:28.042
But you remembered me.

03:28.042 --> 03:29.793
I've profiled enough CEOs

03:29.793 --> 03:34.048
to know that branding is
the number-one rule of success.

03:34.048 --> 03:37.509
- I like that.
- I like you.

03:37.509 --> 03:40.971
Yeah, another ditto.

03:40.971 --> 03:44.516
And if you're serious
about branding consulting,

03:44.516 --> 03:46.560
I just did a piece on Trask.

03:46.560 --> 03:48.062
I would be happy
to introduce you.

03:48.062 --> 03:52.942
Fuck, connected
and she eats pussy?

03:52.942 --> 03:55.027
How am I this lucky?

03:55.027 --> 03:57.029
Oh, if only
my homophobic mother

03:57.029 --> 04:00.324
could hear someone
say that to me.

04:00.324 --> 04:03.327
What are you doing
tomorrow night?

04:06.872 --> 04:08.290
[Anna] Are you about
to ask me back

04:08.290 --> 04:10.125
for another secret booty call?

04:10.125 --> 04:12.962
I was thinking
more like a date, dinner.

04:12.962 --> 04:15.047
[Anna]
Wow, I've been upgraded.

04:15.047 --> 04:20.177
And afterwards,
me and my friend Angie

04:20.177 --> 04:24.181
are gonna hit up Minton's,
if you wanna roll.

04:24.181 --> 04:27.267
- I love to roll.
- Well, all right.

04:27.267 --> 04:29.353
[trills]
[Anna laughs]

04:31.772 --> 04:34.525
the way you look at me...

04:34.525 --> 04:37.903
Good morning.

04:37.903 --> 04:39.530
spinning...

04:39.530 --> 04:41.949
Good morning.

04:41.949 --> 04:44.451
- I made you...
- Oh, my God.

04:44.451 --> 04:48.080
Bagels, and fruit,
and potatoes,

04:48.080 --> 04:50.207
extra bacon.

04:50.207 --> 04:54.420
Oh, I will have to pass.

04:54.420 --> 04:56.422
I don't think one-night stands
are supposed to cook.

04:56.422 --> 04:59.341
I mean, technically
this is my first,

04:59.341 --> 05:01.260
so I'm not totally sure
of all the rules.

05:01.260 --> 05:03.220
But thank you for last night.

05:03.220 --> 05:06.640
You were very...thorough.

05:06.640 --> 05:08.392
I aim to please.

05:08.392 --> 05:13.147
Um...

05:13.147 --> 05:16.358
Farewell, good sir.

05:16.358 --> 05:18.902
W-wait, wait, so that's it?

05:18.902 --> 05:20.362
You're just...
you're just out?

05:20.362 --> 05:22.948
Yeah, I mean,
that was the plan.

05:22.948 --> 05:25.993
You know, fuck me,
choke me, pull my hair,

05:25.993 --> 05:27.661
not cook for me.

05:27.661 --> 05:30.289
But I guess
I'm a little hungry.

05:30.289 --> 05:34.752
I'll just...
I'll have a little bite.

05:34.752 --> 05:36.879
But just to be clear,
this is for my blood sugar,

05:36.879 --> 05:39.131
not because we're having
breakfast together.

05:39.131 --> 05:41.800
Crystal clear.

05:43.260 --> 05:47.097
[soft music]

05:47.097 --> 05:50.017
This means nothing.
The bacon is perfect.

05:50.017 --> 05:52.269
You're perfect.

05:59.777 --> 06:00.778
Daddy!

06:00.778 --> 06:02.738
Oh, my God.
What is that?

06:02.738 --> 06:04.073
What are those?

06:04.073 --> 06:05.991
JJ, how...how are you here?

06:05.991 --> 06:08.077
Oh!
JJ, go to the kitchen.

06:08.077 --> 06:10.245
- Bye, naked lady.
- Oh, God.

06:10.245 --> 06:12.706
Grandma,
how are you home so early?

06:12.706 --> 06:13.916
It was one of those outbreaks

06:13.916 --> 06:15.167
with everyone
getting sick on the ship.

06:15.167 --> 06:16.585
You know white people
don't vaccinate.

06:16.585 --> 06:19.046
I will be out of your hair
as soon as I can find...

06:19.046 --> 06:21.090
This, and these?

06:21.090 --> 06:23.092
Um...it was really nice
meeting you,

06:23.092 --> 06:24.760
and I will happily
reimburse you for any therapy

06:24.760 --> 06:26.011
your son might need after this.

06:26.011 --> 06:28.013
Good day.

06:28.013 --> 06:31.308
Thank you so much.
So sorry.

06:31.308 --> 06:33.477
See, this is exactly why

06:33.477 --> 06:35.104
I don't have sex
with strangers, girl,

06:35.104 --> 06:36.438
because one second you think

06:36.438 --> 06:38.023
you're about to get
a little dick and dip,

06:38.023 --> 06:41.902
and the next, you are hiding
your boobs from a little boy.

06:41.902 --> 06:44.154
Oh, I have been there,
girl...twins.

06:44.154 --> 06:45.322
I don't wanna hear more
of that story.

06:45.322 --> 06:47.699
Suit yourself, but it's good.

06:47.699 --> 06:50.577
Short version, Michael Douglas

06:50.577 --> 06:53.122
didn't ever invite me back
on his houseboat.

06:53.122 --> 06:54.498
Ew.

06:54.498 --> 06:55.874
What sucks, girl,

06:55.874 --> 06:58.585
is that the sex with Shawn
was really good.

06:58.585 --> 07:00.212
And, actually,

07:00.212 --> 07:02.172
I didn't hate talking to him
over breakfast this morning.

07:02.172 --> 07:05.342
Over breakfast?
You met his family?

07:05.342 --> 07:08.220
Accept it, Quinn, you ain't
really about that ho life.

07:08.220 --> 07:11.557
No, I'm learning, okay?
I'm new to this.

07:11.557 --> 07:13.517
I'm a ho apprentice.

07:13.517 --> 07:15.811
And I know one thing for sure:
I'm not gonna see him again.

07:15.811 --> 07:17.146
I can't.

07:17.146 --> 07:19.731
Because, you know,
I have a very strict "no kids

07:19.731 --> 07:22.025
that did not come out
of Quinn" policy.

07:22.025 --> 07:24.862
Thank you, because kids
mean baby mama drama.

07:24.862 --> 07:27.239
And I'm trying to look
for something simple.

07:27.239 --> 07:28.949
I'm not trying to ask
some other

07:28.949 --> 07:31.118
probably not-so-happy woman
into the mix.

07:31.118 --> 07:34.663
- No, please, no.
- Another woman can be fun!

07:34.663 --> 07:39.168
Oh, but that just brings me
back to Mikey's houseboat.

07:39.168 --> 07:41.712
Fuck, I wish
he hadn't changed his number.

07:41.712 --> 07:45.841
Oh, shit!
Oh, I must have left it.

07:45.841 --> 07:49.178
What, pride, dignity,
your virginity?

07:49.178 --> 07:50.387
My necklace!

07:50.387 --> 07:53.390
Damn, I must have
ran out of there so fast

07:53.390 --> 07:55.058
I left it by the bed.

07:55.058 --> 07:57.394
Or in the shower,
Underneath the kitchen table?

07:57.394 --> 08:02.149
Yes, around the world, honey,
that's how I like to travel.

08:02.149 --> 08:04.776
Ugh, my grandmother
gave me that!

08:04.776 --> 08:07.237
Now I'm gonna have to see him
in order to get it back.

08:07.237 --> 08:08.822
It's a sign.

08:08.822 --> 08:11.325
You about to be
an evil stepmom.

08:11.325 --> 08:14.286
- Bitch, I'ma slap you.
- No, I should slap Get Out.

08:14.286 --> 08:15.829
Look at this fucking check!

08:15.829 --> 08:17.372
How the hell you gon'
tax somebody

08:17.372 --> 08:18.832
making this little bit
of money?

08:18.832 --> 08:21.210
Is this how Black
Republicans happen?

08:21.210 --> 08:23.670
Have I been too hard
on Stacey Dash?

08:23.670 --> 08:26.089
No, her and Ben Carson
are forever canceled.

08:26.089 --> 08:30.719
Shit, now I gotta ride out
that nanny gig long-term.

08:30.719 --> 08:32.012
[Jamaican accent]
Mm-mm, my girl,

08:32.012 --> 08:33.764
yu never know it,
so yu a gwine bi a madda.

08:33.764 --> 08:35.057
Wow, Quinn,
that is so offensive.

08:35.057 --> 08:37.142
I only do it
when it's necessary.

08:37.142 --> 08:38.268
Mi can't believe city girl

08:38.268 --> 08:39.519
actually take yu
for Jamaican.

08:39.519 --> 08:40.896
[affecting accent]
Oh, she take mi. She pay mi.

08:40.896 --> 08:42.356
And I take care
of her daughter.

08:42.356 --> 08:43.774
- No, that was horrible.
- "Doughta"?

08:43.774 --> 08:45.525
- "Daughta." "Doughta"?
- No, mm-mm.

08:45.525 --> 08:46.944
- Mm-mm.
- "Daughta"?

08:46.944 --> 08:48.237
It's a horrible ting
you're doing.

08:48.237 --> 08:50.155
Help me!

08:50.155 --> 08:52.407
Yes, thank you.
No, I totally forgot.

08:52.407 --> 08:55.244
I'm sorry, you know what?
I had the worst morning.

08:55.244 --> 08:56.662
And you're right,

08:56.662 --> 08:58.413
even more of a reason
to keep my therapy appointment.

08:58.413 --> 09:00.624
And I will not miss it again,
I promise.

09:00.624 --> 09:02.042
Okay, I'll see you next week.
Thank you.

09:02.042 --> 09:06.463
- Camille.
- Oh, my gosh, Regina, hi!

09:06.463 --> 09:09.091
I haven't seen you here
in forever.

09:09.091 --> 09:11.885
I know!
Um, you know,

09:11.885 --> 09:14.638
our...our shopping schedules
probably just got out of sync.

09:14.638 --> 09:16.723
Or you intentionally stopped
coming on Saturdays,

09:16.723 --> 09:18.684
and you won't return my texts.

09:18.684 --> 09:23.272
You know, work has been,
like, crazy.

09:23.272 --> 09:24.356
Camille.

09:24.356 --> 09:26.692
Okay, shouldn't there be
some type of rule

09:26.692 --> 09:28.860
against mothers talking
to sons' exes,

09:28.860 --> 09:31.196
especially when
said son is engaged?

09:31.196 --> 09:33.282
I'm a grown-ass woman.
I talk to who I want.

09:33.282 --> 09:35.158
And I've wanted
to talk to you.

09:35.158 --> 09:36.660
Ian told me he saw you.

09:36.660 --> 09:41.123
Yep, he did see me,
and I saw him, too.

09:41.123 --> 09:43.208
I mean, obviously,
we saw each other.

09:43.208 --> 09:45.043
But point being is that
we should get together soon.

09:45.043 --> 09:47.713
And we should have lunch
or something and catch up.

09:47.713 --> 09:49.131
Well, it's gotta be
very soon.

09:49.131 --> 09:52.134
I retired,
and I'm finally moving south.

09:52.134 --> 09:53.760
[Camille] Congratulations.

09:53.760 --> 09:55.887
But you can't leave.

09:55.887 --> 09:57.222
You are New York.

09:57.222 --> 10:00.309
Let's be real, New York
ain't New York anymore.

10:00.309 --> 10:04.146
Come to my retirement party,
tomorrow,00 p.m., my house.

10:04.146 --> 10:05.856
I will try.

10:05.856 --> 10:09.526
We all know "try"
is New York for "no."

10:09.526 --> 10:11.278
- No.
[Regina] Please?

10:11.278 --> 10:13.530
It won't feel right leaving
Harlem without you there.

10:13.530 --> 10:17.576
- Won't it be weird with Ian?
- No, not at all.

10:17.576 --> 10:20.662
Ian can't even make it.
So I'll see you there?

10:20.662 --> 10:22.289
Well, I just...you know,
I don't...

10:22.289 --> 10:25.417
I'll see you there.

10:25.417 --> 10:28.003
Well, Regina says
that Ian has other plans.

10:28.003 --> 10:30.130
But even if Ian's not
gonna be there,

10:30.130 --> 10:32.007
aren't exes' families
off-limits?

10:32.007 --> 10:33.675
I don't even like meeting
a dude's family

10:33.675 --> 10:37.346
when we're together,
especially dads.

10:37.346 --> 10:39.097
I may have fucked one
or three of them before.

10:39.097 --> 10:41.933
- While you're still together?
- You fuck anything.

10:41.933 --> 10:44.102
[Quinn] Okay, ex-families are
definitely off-limits.

10:44.102 --> 10:46.271
I remember in the sixth grade,
I dated a boy.

10:46.271 --> 10:47.898
His parents owned Hyatt Hotels.

10:47.898 --> 10:50.067
And now,
I will never stay at one just

10:50.067 --> 10:52.152
to avoid the remote possibility
of ever seeing them.

10:52.152 --> 10:55.655
That's a bit extreme, Quinn.
There's like 5,000 Hyatts.

10:55.655 --> 10:57.157
Actually, there's 843,

10:57.157 --> 10:58.617
and they'll never get
Quinn's money.

10:58.617 --> 11:00.327
Well, that's why they're

11:00.327 --> 11:02.079
called the Hyatt,
not the Angie.

11:02.079 --> 11:03.580
Oh!

11:03.580 --> 11:06.124
Okay, fuck y'all.
I'm making my own money now.

11:06.124 --> 11:07.376
[Tye] Mm-hmm.

11:07.376 --> 11:08.794
Yeah, but I should go
to Regina's, right?

11:08.794 --> 11:10.379
- No, you shouldn't.
- Of course you should.

11:10.379 --> 11:11.713
[Camille] Right?
- Yes.

11:11.713 --> 11:13.715
I mean, Regina's been like
a second mom to me.

11:13.715 --> 11:16.343
More like a first mom to me,
if you count my shit show.

11:16.343 --> 11:19.721
Are you sure you wanna go
back to Ian Ground Zero?

11:19.721 --> 11:24.226
Okay, that is dramatic,
but no, I don't.

11:24.226 --> 11:26.686
But I do feel like I owe it
to Regina to at least go

11:26.686 --> 11:28.730
and say a proper goodbye.

11:28.730 --> 11:30.315
I mean,
I have been kind of a douche

11:30.315 --> 11:31.566
to her ever since the breakup.

11:31.566 --> 11:33.777
Oh, Quinn's a slut.
Camille's a douche.

11:33.777 --> 11:36.780
Why is everyone
stealing my brand?

11:36.780 --> 11:39.032
I will go with you, Camille,
if you need support.

11:39.032 --> 11:40.242
I appreciate that.

11:40.242 --> 11:41.535
Especially
if you come with me

11:41.535 --> 11:43.245
to go get my necklace
back from Shawn.

11:43.245 --> 11:45.497
- Of course.
- Well, I can't go.

11:45.497 --> 11:48.875
Tye and I are doing Minton's.
Plus, I kind of don't wanna.

11:48.875 --> 11:50.127
It sounds messy.

11:50.127 --> 11:52.003
For the record,
it just sounds to me

11:52.003 --> 11:54.798
like you're dipping
your toe back into Ian drama.

11:54.798 --> 11:58.802
No, this is not about Ian.
Don't read into it.

11:58.802 --> 12:00.137
And you watch
too much Bravo.

12:00.137 --> 12:02.389
Ooh, speaking of, are we
getting together on Friday

12:02.389 --> 12:05.350
to watch the finale
of Weather Tampa ?

12:05.350 --> 12:07.936
Of course.
You know it's hurricane season.

12:07.936 --> 12:09.855
[Tye]
Yes, it's hurricane season!

12:09.855 --> 12:11.273
We're hosting, we're hosting.

12:11.273 --> 12:12.816
- Uh-huh.
- "We" are?

12:12.816 --> 12:15.902
Oh, okay, you are.
Camille hosted last week.

12:15.902 --> 12:18.321
- I did.
- Oh, I guess I forgot.

12:18.321 --> 12:21.658
Ugh, it's just my brain.
It's fried with work.

12:21.658 --> 12:23.410
The store's going
from bad to worse.

12:23.410 --> 12:26.705
Real talk, Quinn, you should
really try to get an investor.

12:26.705 --> 12:28.957
You need somebody
who can put money into building

12:28.957 --> 12:31.710
the brand that's not interested
in making a quick buck.

12:31.710 --> 12:33.462
You need a wealthy white.

12:33.462 --> 12:36.339
Yes, I love me
a wealthy white.

12:36.339 --> 12:39.468
They will bail you out
of jail, anytime day or night,

12:39.468 --> 12:40.969
no questions asked.

12:40.969 --> 12:42.387
I always forget
you're from Staten Island.

12:42.387 --> 12:44.598
Girl, try as I might,
I can't forget.

12:44.598 --> 12:46.016
You know what?

12:46.016 --> 12:47.934
I think an investor would
really help me spread my wings.

12:47.934 --> 12:49.644
Do you think maybe
you can introduce me

12:49.644 --> 12:51.813
to a few of your contacts, Tye?

12:51.813 --> 12:54.441
I'll get back to you.

12:54.441 --> 12:56.943
Do you think Tye is really
gonna get back to me?

12:56.943 --> 13:00.113
- Of course, why wouldn't she?
- [phone dings]

13:00.113 --> 13:01.156
Oh, gosh.

13:01.156 --> 13:03.658
This is Jameson texting again.
Nope.

13:03.658 --> 13:05.410
No, didn't you say
you had a good time?

13:05.410 --> 13:07.913
Are you really
gonna cut him off

13:07.913 --> 13:10.665
just because
of a little dick-ception?

13:10.665 --> 13:12.459
Uh, there ain't nothing little
about that dick,

13:12.459 --> 13:14.044
but what's the "ception" part?

13:14.044 --> 13:16.296
Dick-ception,
a harmless untruth

13:16.296 --> 13:18.215
that a guy tells just
in order to give you some.

13:18.215 --> 13:19.883
Angie's been teaching me
all the words, okay?

13:19.883 --> 13:22.469
It's like a reverse
My Fair Lady.

13:22.469 --> 13:26.139
But, for real, the fact
that he put all of that work in

13:26.139 --> 13:28.141
just to show you a good time...

13:28.141 --> 13:30.143
Come on,
that's kind of romantic, Cam.

13:30.143 --> 13:32.979
Plus, on paper,
he's the perfect guy for you.

13:32.979 --> 13:37.192
Well, this isn't paper.
And what about your stripper?

13:37.192 --> 13:39.402
When are we gonna get
your necklace back?

13:39.402 --> 13:40.904
We don't.

13:40.904 --> 13:43.406
I brilliantly gave
Shawn this address

13:43.406 --> 13:45.408
and then told him
to text me when he was outside.

13:45.408 --> 13:49.538
And then I was hoping maybe
you might go and get it for me.

13:49.538 --> 13:52.290
Won't that be awkward?

13:52.290 --> 13:53.708
Oh.

13:53.708 --> 13:56.253
Speaking of awkward,
you are here.

13:56.253 --> 13:58.838
Yeah, at my mom's.
What are the odds?

13:58.838 --> 14:00.632
- Hey, Quinn.
- Hi.

14:00.632 --> 14:04.094
All right, well,
someone must've invited y'all.

14:04.094 --> 14:07.389
Okay,
should we leave or go in?

14:07.389 --> 14:09.224
[both] We should leave.
[Camille] Okay.

14:09.224 --> 14:11.518
No, no, no, we should go in.
We should go in.

14:11.518 --> 14:13.103
We should go in, girl.
Just go in.

14:13.103 --> 14:15.355
No, no, no, no,
we should leave.

14:15.355 --> 14:16.940
We should leave.
Go, go, go.

14:16.940 --> 14:18.275
No, no, no, go in?

14:18.275 --> 14:21.152
Damn, I already gave
Shawn the address.

14:21.152 --> 14:23.655
Go in. Damn it.

14:23.655 --> 14:27.909
I cannot believe
that we are that annoying,

14:27.909 --> 14:32.330
happy couple that I hate.

14:32.330 --> 14:35.041
But I kind of love it.

14:35.041 --> 14:37.794
- Mmm.
- Mm-hmm.

14:37.794 --> 14:40.297
Fuck, that's good.

14:40.297 --> 14:42.882
So how was work today?

14:42.882 --> 14:46.011
More importantly,
my cover story?

14:46.011 --> 14:48.388
- Not a cover story.
- Mm-hmm.

14:48.388 --> 14:51.474
But I think you'll be
very, very happy.

14:51.474 --> 14:53.184
When can I read it?

14:53.184 --> 14:54.603
When it hits the stands.

14:54.603 --> 14:57.397
So, honey,

14:57.397 --> 15:01.276
you can't slip me
an advanced copy?

15:01.276 --> 15:05.780
No, I will slip you
no such thing.

15:05.780 --> 15:07.741
What if I do that thing
that you like?

15:07.741 --> 15:10.910
Mm.
Slip for a slip, huh?

15:10.910 --> 15:12.287
That is tempting.

15:12.287 --> 15:15.457
Let me get the check
before you change your mind.

15:15.457 --> 15:17.208
Check, please.
Thank you.

15:20.712 --> 15:23.465
Hey, thanks for dinner.

15:23.465 --> 15:25.967
[Tye] Really?
- Mm-hmm.

15:34.059 --> 15:37.854
Um...can we rain check
Minton's?

15:37.854 --> 15:40.774
I'm just really fried.

15:40.774 --> 15:43.026
Do you just want to go back
to your place?

15:43.026 --> 15:46.071
'Cause you mentioned
some quid pro quo.

15:46.071 --> 15:50.450
Um, another time.
I'm just tired.

15:50.450 --> 15:53.787
Okay, yeah.
Are you sure everything is...

15:53.787 --> 15:58.124
- A hundred.
- Okay.

15:58.124 --> 16:00.585
- Good night.
- Good night.

16:05.757 --> 16:07.926
Fuck.

16:09.678 --> 16:11.721
- There she is.
[Camille] Hi.

16:11.721 --> 16:13.807
Are you ladies
having a good time?

16:13.807 --> 16:17.435
Yes, yes.
Gosh, I-I missed this house.

16:17.435 --> 16:20.230
Camille, you look wonderful,
like no time has passed at all.

16:20.230 --> 16:21.523
Are they experimenting

16:21.523 --> 16:23.191
on Black folks up there
at Columbia?

16:23.191 --> 16:24.442
Well, if they were,

16:24.442 --> 16:26.236
it wouldn't be for us
to look young.

16:26.236 --> 16:27.570
I am so glad you came.

16:27.570 --> 16:29.656
You know, you were always
like a daughter to me.

16:29.656 --> 16:33.910
Thank you, but, you know,
I was surprised to see the guy

16:33.910 --> 16:35.328
who's kind of
like a son to you.

16:35.328 --> 16:36.996
Ian is here.

16:36.996 --> 16:38.873
Oh, yeah, well,
his plans changed.

16:38.873 --> 16:41.376
- I hope that's okay.
[Camille] Oh no, totally.

16:41.376 --> 16:43.545
I mean, it's more than okay.
It's actually awesome.

16:43.545 --> 16:45.046
I mean, it's like
the most perfect thing.

16:45.046 --> 16:46.923
Ian's here in the house 'cause,
you know, he grew up here...

16:46.923 --> 16:49.551
- Camille.
- Oh, there's Dwana.

16:49.551 --> 16:53.847
Dwana, girl,
you better give me those shoes.

16:53.847 --> 16:57.976
There she is.
Ian's fiancée, Mira.

16:57.976 --> 17:00.103
[Quinn] Oh, I mean, she's cool

17:00.103 --> 17:01.771
if you're into
that thin model type, I guess.

17:01.771 --> 17:03.231
Right.

17:03.231 --> 17:04.983
But see, she looks
so out of place here.

17:04.983 --> 17:06.317
Look, she looks like
she don't fit.

17:06.317 --> 17:08.611
Just a little bit less.
Thank you.

17:08.611 --> 17:10.572
Yeah, I do kind of
feel bad for her.

17:10.572 --> 17:12.115
Yeah, me too.

17:12.115 --> 17:14.451
But look, it cannot be easy
watching your fiancé's ex

17:14.451 --> 17:16.119
just getting loved on
by his whole family.

17:16.119 --> 17:19.289
Regina ain't slick, okay?

17:19.289 --> 17:21.332
Oh, please, come on.
His plans change?

17:21.332 --> 17:23.460
Okay, like Ian was ever gonna
miss his mom's party.

17:23.460 --> 17:24.961
She knew he was
gonna be here.

17:24.961 --> 17:26.171
You think so?

17:26.171 --> 17:28.423
Of course.
This is totally a setup.

17:28.423 --> 17:29.466
Yeah, but why?

17:29.466 --> 17:31.176
Because she's probably hoping

17:31.176 --> 17:32.761
that you and him will
still get back together.

17:32.761 --> 17:35.680
No, I mean,
he's clearly moved on.

17:35.680 --> 17:37.474
Camille, of course she is.

17:37.474 --> 17:39.017
Come on,
she just said it herself.

17:39.017 --> 17:40.935
You're almost like a daughter
to her still.

17:40.935 --> 17:43.146
- Maybe you're right.
[Quinn] I'm definitely right.

17:43.146 --> 17:46.608
Look, you're still on the wall,
for crying out loud.

17:46.608 --> 17:48.777
[Camille] Aww.

17:48.777 --> 17:50.904
Ian and I did always dream
about moving in here

17:50.904 --> 17:54.574
after we got married,
had some kids, maybe a dog.

17:54.574 --> 17:56.117
Are you fucking kidding me?

17:56.117 --> 17:58.077
Oh, calm down, I always
indulge your romantic side.

17:58.077 --> 18:01.206
No, Shawn.
He's inside.

18:01.206 --> 18:02.707
Ooh!

18:04.709 --> 18:07.253
What are you doing here?
You were supposed to text.

18:07.253 --> 18:09.547
I did, four times.
No response.

18:10.924 --> 18:12.801
Oh, okay, well, fair enough.

18:12.801 --> 18:15.220
Well, if you'll just
give me my necklace,

18:15.220 --> 18:16.429
then you can be on your way.

18:16.429 --> 18:18.807
Quinn, who is
this handsome slab

18:18.807 --> 18:20.183
of a man you brought
to my house?

18:20.183 --> 18:22.811
Hi, I'm Shawn.
I love your home.

18:22.811 --> 18:24.145
Well, thank you.

18:24.145 --> 18:26.898
- I was just leaving, so...
- Like hell you are.

18:26.898 --> 18:28.650
Nobody leaves
my house hungry, right?

18:28.650 --> 18:29.818
- Right.
- You like ribs?

18:29.818 --> 18:31.277
Come on, baby,
I'm gonna get you...

18:31.277 --> 18:32.529
I love this woman!

18:32.529 --> 18:35.406
Yeah, she's great.

18:35.406 --> 18:36.407
[singer]

18:36.407 --> 18:38.326
[softly] Kill me.

18:38.326 --> 18:41.329
[singer]

18:44.999 --> 18:48.294
- Yo, yo, yo.
- Hey, girl, this hair.

18:48.294 --> 18:50.088
I know.
Still getting used to it,

18:50.088 --> 18:51.798
but...you know.

18:51.798 --> 18:53.466
- Uh-oh.
- What?

18:53.466 --> 18:55.510
You wear your Retro 4s
when you've been getting some,

18:55.510 --> 18:59.597
but you wear your Retro 9s
when you're into someone.

18:59.597 --> 19:02.517
And I haven't seen those
since Melissa.

19:02.517 --> 19:06.020
- You don't know my life.
- Uh-huh, so where is she?

19:06.020 --> 19:08.690
Yeah, I changed my mind.

19:08.690 --> 19:09.899
Girl, you tear
through pussy faster

19:09.899 --> 19:11.442
than I would if I liked it.

19:11.442 --> 19:12.902
So what was wrong
with this one?

19:12.902 --> 19:16.823
Nothing,
she's funny, mad smart.

19:16.823 --> 19:17.991
Okay, so what's the problem?

19:17.991 --> 19:20.368
She's...

19:20.368 --> 19:21.995
she's white.

19:21.995 --> 19:23.872
Ooh, twist!

19:23.872 --> 19:26.165
- You think I'm a sellout?
- Mm.

19:26.165 --> 19:27.500
- I didn't say that.
[Tye] You do.

19:27.500 --> 19:29.836
But listen, I'm not like
these other Black people

19:29.836 --> 19:31.379
that get a little bit
of success

19:31.379 --> 19:32.922
and then start
dating white people.

19:32.922 --> 19:37.176
It just happened,
and I like her.

19:37.176 --> 19:38.553
I thought I could handle it,

19:38.553 --> 19:40.138
but the way people looked
at us,

19:40.138 --> 19:42.932
and what kind of message
am I sending to the world?

19:42.932 --> 19:44.601
"Hi, I'm Tye,

19:44.601 --> 19:47.353
"and I created an app
so that queer people of color

19:47.353 --> 19:48.855
"can meet and fall in love.

19:48.855 --> 19:51.274
"But here's my white wife
and our mixed kids,

19:51.274 --> 19:53.067
and my little baby
Labradoodle."

19:53.067 --> 19:55.486
Tye, pump the brakes!

19:55.486 --> 19:57.655
You think I should
break up with her?

19:57.655 --> 19:58.823
You do.

19:58.823 --> 20:00.450
You think I should
break up with her.

20:00.450 --> 20:02.076
You're bugging.

20:02.076 --> 20:05.663
It does not matter what I think
or what anyone else thinks.

20:05.663 --> 20:08.499
Bullshit.
You know how we go in

20:08.499 --> 20:11.502
on Black men
who have white girlfriends.

20:11.502 --> 20:13.630
But those are the guys
who say they date white women

20:13.630 --> 20:15.131
because Black women are
too loud,

20:15.131 --> 20:17.133
too aggressive,
and too difficult.

20:17.133 --> 20:19.093
That is not you.

20:19.093 --> 20:22.555
I don't think I can handle
the pressure, Ang.

20:22.555 --> 20:24.682
At the end of the day,
love is love.

20:24.682 --> 20:27.435
But a relationship is
a choice.

20:27.435 --> 20:29.228
I don't have to choose Anna.

20:29.228 --> 20:30.730
It sounds like you
already know

20:30.730 --> 20:32.398
what you wanna do.

20:32.398 --> 20:34.025
Well, hold on, where's Trina?

20:34.025 --> 20:35.777
Oh, Trina gone.
I burnt her.

20:35.777 --> 20:38.613
- You burned her?
- RIP to Trina.

20:38.613 --> 20:40.114
Girl, that is human hair!

20:40.114 --> 20:42.033
Listen, I'll order you
a new one, a new Trina.

20:42.033 --> 20:42.992
Ooh.

20:42.992 --> 20:44.869
And maybe even
a Debbie, bitch.

20:44.869 --> 20:47.705
Oh, hold on, 'cause Debbie
sound like she blonde.

20:47.705 --> 20:50.041
She sound like she blow
in the wind, bitch.

20:50.041 --> 20:51.793
So, I mean, what?

20:51.793 --> 20:53.753
You're gonna stay
all night or...

20:53.753 --> 20:57.006
It's the last plate, I swear.

20:57.006 --> 21:00.051
You said that
three plates ago.

21:00.051 --> 21:01.719
And, please, be careful.

21:01.719 --> 21:05.306
You're never gonna get that
sauce out of this dress suede.

21:05.306 --> 21:08.851
Thank you.
What are you, a dry cleaner?

21:08.851 --> 21:11.562
I'm a designer.
That's why I know fabric.

21:11.562 --> 21:14.649
So you're gorgeous,
and you're talented.

21:14.649 --> 21:17.193
Did I just stumble across
the perfect woman?

21:17.193 --> 21:19.487
It was less of a stumble
and more of a dick drag

21:19.487 --> 21:22.323
across the forehead in front
of 100 strangers, but...

21:22.323 --> 21:25.576
- Okay.
- A tale as old as time.

21:25.576 --> 21:28.621
[Beyoncé's "Love on Top"]

21:28.621 --> 21:32.500
So where do I buy your stuff?

21:32.500 --> 21:37.380
My store.
Well, for now, at least.

21:37.380 --> 21:39.799
Running a boutique
is so expensive,

21:39.799 --> 21:41.926
especially after you throw in
trying to make everything

21:41.926 --> 21:44.178
with ethical,
sustainable fabrics.

21:44.178 --> 21:45.722
And then your rent goes up,

21:45.722 --> 21:48.182
and then all of a sudden, you
have to ask your mom for money.

21:48.182 --> 21:49.559
And then your friend
isn't helping, even though

21:49.559 --> 21:52.687
she's sleeping on the couch,
and then...

21:52.687 --> 21:57.066
I'm sorry.
I just said way too much.

21:57.066 --> 22:01.195
Sometimes I have a big mouth.

22:01.195 --> 22:04.157
I love your big mouth.

22:04.157 --> 22:07.869
Ew, but kind of hot.

22:07.869 --> 22:09.620
Aunt Tammy, I thought when
I went to Paris,

22:09.620 --> 22:10.747
I was gonna come home,

22:10.747 --> 22:12.123
my family was gonna
be proud of me.

22:12.123 --> 22:14.042
You're a world traveler,
congratulations.

22:14.042 --> 22:16.461
No one from Harlem
has ever been to Paris.

22:16.461 --> 22:18.379
I'm on the verge
of a whole new life.

22:18.379 --> 22:20.131
As a chef, financially,
socially...

22:20.131 --> 22:21.591
And I'm thrilled for you,
darling.

22:21.591 --> 22:24.135
I'm just not clear
why you and the white folk

22:24.135 --> 22:26.054
had to push Ray's out to do it.

22:26.054 --> 22:29.057
Aunt Tammy, Ray's went under
'cause people stopped going.

22:29.057 --> 22:31.768
But you sure jumped at the
opportunity to snatch it up.

22:31.768 --> 22:32.935
But you know what?

22:32.935 --> 22:35.063
You were always
a selfish little kid.

22:35.063 --> 22:37.607
It makes me sad
you don't care about history.

22:37.607 --> 22:39.233
Oh, well,
come on, Aunt Tammy.

22:39.233 --> 22:42.528
I mean, when was the last time
you really went to Ray's?

22:42.528 --> 22:44.947
Why are you here, Camille?
I thought you two broke up.

22:44.947 --> 22:46.908
We did.

22:46.908 --> 22:48.868
Mm, so you came
because of history.

22:48.868 --> 22:50.286
She gets it, Ian.

22:50.286 --> 22:52.538
Yes, but you have
to at least try

22:52.538 --> 22:54.040
to be excited for your nephew.

22:54.040 --> 22:56.084
I mean, he's doing his thing.

22:56.084 --> 22:58.586
And, yes, we will definitely
miss Ray's, too.

22:58.586 --> 23:01.589
- It meant a lot to us.
- Where we had our first date.

23:01.589 --> 23:05.468
But, for real, I mean,
Ray's has fallen off.

23:05.468 --> 23:06.677
Everybody knows it.

23:06.677 --> 23:08.137
[Ian] Yep, he had a C.

23:08.137 --> 23:09.889
You know how hard it is
to get a C?

23:09.889 --> 23:11.641
He's 83 years old.

23:11.641 --> 23:13.768
He fell asleep
at the fryer one time,

23:13.768 --> 23:15.603
and y'all wanna make
a big fuss.

23:15.603 --> 23:18.606
Fuck off, Ian, and it's nice
to see you, Camille.

23:18.606 --> 23:19.857
Mm-hmm.

23:21.776 --> 23:23.945
You see what I gotta
deal with?

23:23.945 --> 23:25.696
Yeah.

23:25.696 --> 23:27.031
Thanks for trying at least.

23:27.031 --> 23:29.909
Yep, she was definitely
eating you alive.

23:29.909 --> 23:32.161
Uh, your mom said that
you weren't going to be here.

23:32.161 --> 23:34.205
So, you know,
I wouldn't have come otherwise.

23:34.205 --> 23:35.498
It's fine.

23:35.498 --> 23:37.166
Right.

23:39.293 --> 23:40.711
Could you pass me
a paring knife?

23:40.711 --> 23:42.672
Oh, I know, you ain't gonna
act like you don't know

23:42.672 --> 23:44.006
your way around this kitchen.

23:44.006 --> 23:47.593
All the times you've been
my sous chef in here.

23:47.593 --> 23:50.138
Give me that knife.

23:53.015 --> 23:55.601
- Thank you.
- It smells amazing.

23:55.601 --> 24:00.022
Taste tester, please test.

24:03.401 --> 24:05.862
I like, except for I think

24:05.862 --> 24:07.947
that it could take
just a little bit more...

24:07.947 --> 24:09.740
- More heat?
- There you go.

24:09.740 --> 24:11.075
- You right.
- Yeah.

24:11.075 --> 24:14.912
Same page,
we was always on the same page.

24:14.912 --> 24:16.247
Not always.

24:16.247 --> 24:19.000
The times you was right,
we was on the same page.

24:22.420 --> 24:26.048
Ian, I know that a lot's
been said between us,

24:26.048 --> 24:28.676
and most of it
hasn't been great.

24:28.676 --> 24:31.721
But what's happening in Harlem
isn't your fault.

24:31.721 --> 24:35.474
And I wanted you to know
that I am really proud of you.

24:35.474 --> 24:38.769
You had a dream,
and you are making it happen.

24:38.769 --> 24:40.188
I appreciate that.

24:40.188 --> 24:42.481
We're having a tasting party
there in a few weeks.

24:42.481 --> 24:43.649
You should come.

24:43.649 --> 24:47.570
And look at you,
professor at Columbia, hm?

24:47.570 --> 24:49.113
I'm proud of you, too.

24:49.113 --> 24:50.489
It looks like we both

24:50.489 --> 24:53.492
finally getting everything
we wanted, huh?

24:53.492 --> 24:56.579
Yeah, totally.

24:56.579 --> 24:59.415
So I'm gonna go find Quinn
'cause I think

24:59.415 --> 25:04.003
I have to help her steal
her necklace back or something.

25:04.003 --> 25:05.922
Well, I've always
been a vegan.

25:05.922 --> 25:08.049
And it's not just about
the food for me, you know?

25:08.049 --> 25:09.467
I make it a lifestyle.

25:09.467 --> 25:12.345
Even our wedding will have
a negative carbon footprint.

25:12.345 --> 25:13.763
Oh, wow!

25:13.763 --> 25:15.765
So, wait, do you have
an eco-friendly wedding dress?

25:15.765 --> 25:17.683
Not exactly, Vera Wang.

25:17.683 --> 25:19.810
No, no, listen,
you want negative footprint,

25:19.810 --> 25:22.230
it all starts with the dress.

25:22.230 --> 25:24.398
Do you know how much
of the rainforest is destroyed

25:24.398 --> 25:26.067
for the silk
that's in wedding gowns?

25:26.067 --> 25:27.026
I don't...I've never heard
that.

25:27.026 --> 25:28.110
You wouldn't believe it.

25:28.110 --> 25:29.445
You don't want that
on your conscience.

25:29.445 --> 25:32.031
I have a friend who has an
eco-friendly fashion boutique.

25:32.031 --> 25:33.491
- She's actually here.
[Mira] Oh, brilliant.

25:33.491 --> 25:35.159
- I have to meet her.
- Here she is.

25:35.159 --> 25:36.827
Hey, Quinn, this is Mira.

25:36.827 --> 25:37.787
- Hi.
[Mira] Hi.

25:37.787 --> 25:39.622
Quinn, you wouldn't
believe this,

25:39.622 --> 25:43.084
but Mira needs an ethically
designed wedding dress.

25:43.084 --> 25:44.585
Good for you, good luck.

25:44.585 --> 25:45.920
Thank you.
I was gonna go

25:45.920 --> 25:47.713
with a traditional designer,
but here you are.

25:47.713 --> 25:51.550
Now, the budget is small,
mid-five figures.

25:51.550 --> 25:54.428
- What?
- Mm-hmm.

25:54.428 --> 25:56.138
That's less than what
I'm used to getting,

25:56.138 --> 25:58.516
but I'm listening.

25:58.516 --> 26:00.101
[tapping on a glass]

26:00.101 --> 26:02.728
Thank you all
for coming out tonight.

26:02.728 --> 26:06.023
It means a lot to see friends
and family here.

26:06.023 --> 26:10.194
Harlem has been
such a huge part of my life.

26:10.194 --> 26:12.363
And it will be hard
for us to leave it,

26:12.363 --> 26:16.867
but our legacy remains as Ian
and my new daughter,

26:16.867 --> 26:20.413
Mira, will be taking over
the brownstone.

26:20.413 --> 26:22.456
[guests clap and murmur]

26:22.456 --> 26:24.834
My dream of the next generation
of Walkers

26:24.834 --> 26:26.544
living here has come true.

26:26.544 --> 26:27.920
Are you okay?

26:27.920 --> 26:30.715
Yeah, yeah.

26:30.715 --> 26:32.008
No.

26:32.008 --> 26:33.884
They've moved on.

26:33.884 --> 26:35.261
Everyone's moved on.

26:35.261 --> 26:40.558
Ian and I are history.

26:40.558 --> 26:43.060
- Baby...
[Mira] Oh, cheers, Regina.

26:43.060 --> 26:44.895
I never thought
in a million years

26:44.895 --> 26:47.440
this is where my life
would take me.

26:47.440 --> 26:49.358
But that is the power of love.

26:49.358 --> 26:50.860
- Aww!
- No.

26:50.860 --> 26:53.821
When I met this goofy man,
I thought he was dreadful.

26:53.821 --> 26:55.990
- Mm-hmm.
- All right, Aunt Tammy.

26:55.990 --> 26:58.659
I spent years building
an image in my head

26:58.659 --> 27:00.161
of what a husband would be.

27:00.161 --> 27:03.205
And Ian couldn't have been
more opposite, just god-awful.

27:03.205 --> 27:05.374
I mean,
every deal-breaker on my list.

27:05.374 --> 27:08.753
All right,
I think they get it, baby.

27:08.753 --> 27:14.383
My point is, when
the right one comes along,

27:14.383 --> 27:19.638
you let go of certain rules
and go with love.

27:19.638 --> 27:23.017
[all] To love.

27:23.017 --> 27:25.895
[Camille] Even though I have
a strict no lies rule,

27:25.895 --> 27:27.897
after much consideration
with the judges,

27:27.897 --> 27:30.858
it has been determined
that romantic gestures fall

27:30.858 --> 27:34.320
just outside the technical
definition of a lie.

27:34.320 --> 27:36.405
Oh, I love a technicality.

27:36.405 --> 27:40.451
But look, I...I get that
I freaked you out.

27:40.451 --> 27:42.828
It's just that real life
isn't like the movies

27:42.828 --> 27:45.915
where perfect dates just, boom,
magically happen, you know?

27:45.915 --> 27:47.208
They require planning,

27:47.208 --> 27:49.335
and you gave me
about 10 minutes' notice.

27:49.335 --> 27:52.004
Well, see,
here is no notice at all.

27:52.004 --> 27:54.465
- You want a rematch?
- Show me no mercy.

27:54.465 --> 27:56.717
Oh, I don't plan to.

27:56.717 --> 28:00.179
[singer]

28:09.605 --> 28:10.981
What's up?

28:10.981 --> 28:13.776
I don't...

28:13.776 --> 28:15.861
I don't know
if I can do this.

28:15.861 --> 28:18.823
Get rice pudding?
I promise you're gonna love it.

28:18.823 --> 28:21.367
Rice pudding is the most
underrated of all desserts.

28:21.367 --> 28:22.410
No.

28:22.410 --> 28:23.953
I know this is
out of nowhere,

28:23.953 --> 28:27.623
but I can't date you.

28:27.623 --> 28:29.875
- Wait, what?
- I'm sorry.

28:29.875 --> 28:32.586
Well, at least you're sorry.

28:32.586 --> 28:33.879
Why?

28:33.879 --> 28:35.631
I don't want
to be a successful Black person

28:35.631 --> 28:36.799
dating a white woman.

28:36.799 --> 28:38.551
I created an app
for this very thing,

28:38.551 --> 28:39.427
and I will feel like
a hypocrite

28:39.427 --> 28:40.678
walking around with a...

28:40.678 --> 28:42.263
Oh, please don't finish
that sentence.

28:42.263 --> 28:44.682
I'm in
a complicated position.

28:44.682 --> 28:46.225
You understand that, right?

28:46.225 --> 28:49.520
Tye, I don't think
anybody is paying attention

28:49.520 --> 28:50.563
to who you're dating.

28:50.563 --> 28:52.648
Trust me, they are,

28:52.648 --> 28:55.276
and that's the difference
between the two of us.

28:55.276 --> 28:56.944
You don't ever have to be aware

28:56.944 --> 28:58.362
of who's paying
attention to us.

28:58.362 --> 29:01.907
Your friends think dating me
is cool and progressive,

29:01.907 --> 29:05.286
but for me,
it's a stamp of a sellout.

29:05.286 --> 29:07.413
I'm not an idiot.

29:07.413 --> 29:09.540
And I know that I have
blind spots

29:09.540 --> 29:11.292
with certain things,

29:11.292 --> 29:12.626
but if you are making decisions

29:12.626 --> 29:15.921
based on what everyone else
says and thinks,

29:15.921 --> 29:19.550
well, you're not a sellout.

29:19.550 --> 29:20.885
You're just a coward.

29:20.885 --> 29:23.888
[smooth music]

29:35.566 --> 29:37.776
[woman] I know what I know
because my man is

29:37.776 --> 29:39.320
the greatest weatherman
in the entire...

29:39.320 --> 29:41.155
- Ooh!
- Oh, my God.

29:41.155 --> 29:43.574
Your husband couldn't tell
the difference

29:43.574 --> 29:46.327
between a category three
and a category five.

29:46.327 --> 29:48.287
We should have been
in shelters, ho!

29:48.287 --> 29:50.623
Bitch, my husband was only
two days on the job,

29:50.623 --> 29:52.833
and he saw Katrina coming
before anybody else, okay?

29:52.833 --> 29:54.168
That's an old storm.

29:54.168 --> 29:56.587
You still riding off
that 'Trina success?

29:56.587 --> 29:58.631
I bet you
he did not warn you

29:58.631 --> 30:01.008
that there was
a chance of showers!

30:01.008 --> 30:02.760
Ahh!

30:02.760 --> 30:05.262
- Ooh!
- Yes!

30:05.262 --> 30:08.390
Girl, Yolanda get up, boom!

30:08.390 --> 30:09.683
[Camille] That was silly!

30:09.683 --> 30:11.268
You would've got dragged.

30:11.268 --> 30:13.187
Ooh, so good!

30:13.187 --> 30:14.605
Yolanda always up
to something.

30:14.605 --> 30:17.274
How do you even meet
a meteorologist?

30:17.274 --> 30:19.777
I can't believe
that a show

30:19.777 --> 30:24.323
that goes against everything
I stand for can be so perfect.

30:26.200 --> 30:28.577
Okay, I have to fess up.

30:28.577 --> 30:29.912
I'm giving Jameson
another shot.

30:29.912 --> 30:32.206
[Quinn] Yay.
- Be careful, Camille.

30:32.206 --> 30:34.583
I went against my rule
about not dating white women,

30:34.583 --> 30:36.919
and that shit imploded
in my face.

30:36.919 --> 30:38.879
I just hope she doesn't
take it out on me

30:38.879 --> 30:40.714
by screwing
with my Forbes article.

30:40.714 --> 30:43.092
Oh, after Trina
sacrificed herself!

30:43.092 --> 30:44.635
Girl, fuck that wig!

30:44.635 --> 30:46.845
Well, since we're sharing,
Shawn's coming over tonight.

30:46.845 --> 30:48.264
Ooh!

30:48.264 --> 30:50.558
If I see him twice,
is it still a one-night stand?

30:50.558 --> 30:51.934
It's a two-night stand.

30:51.934 --> 30:53.686
Girl, you better
keep that man around,

30:53.686 --> 30:55.437
especially after he got you
that gig

30:55.437 --> 30:57.815
designing Mira's wedding dress.

30:57.815 --> 31:00.359
Oh, look, the show's back on!

31:00.359 --> 31:02.319
- I'm a real woman...
[Camille] Wait, what?

31:02.319 --> 31:05.114
Flat earth and all, bitch!

31:05.114 --> 31:06.740
You're working with Mira?

31:06.740 --> 31:09.243
She asked me
to design her dress.

31:09.243 --> 31:10.995
Babe, I know how this looks,

31:10.995 --> 31:12.663
but I promise you
this is not personal.

31:12.663 --> 31:13.998
It's only business.

31:13.998 --> 31:15.708
Five figures' worth
of business.

31:15.708 --> 31:17.084
Angie!

31:17.084 --> 31:19.003
Yeah,
she offered me 25 grand.

31:19.003 --> 31:20.421
I was gonna talk
to you about it

31:20.421 --> 31:22.506
'cause you know how
the store has been doing.

31:22.506 --> 31:23.799
And it was weird.
She was there,

31:23.799 --> 31:25.551
and then she said it,
and it was really fast.

31:25.551 --> 31:28.387
And what was I supposed to do,
say no?

31:28.387 --> 31:32.016
Yes, "no" is exactly what
you say to my ex's fiancée.

31:32.016 --> 31:33.267
That's fucked up, Camille.

31:33.267 --> 31:34.977
I mean,
you really want me to choose

31:34.977 --> 31:36.312
between my business
and our friendship?

31:36.312 --> 31:38.105
Oh, no, no need.

31:38.105 --> 31:39.773
It seems like
you already chose.

31:39.773 --> 31:41.900
Yo, Quinn, that's fucked up.

31:41.900 --> 31:44.486
[Quinn and weather wife] Hold
up, hold up, hold up, okay?

31:44.486 --> 31:46.488
Because I never even
would have needed this check

31:46.488 --> 31:49.783
if you hadn't been so damn
stingy with your contacts.

31:49.783 --> 31:52.578
[Tye] Bitch, no.
Don't blame your shit on me.

31:52.578 --> 31:55.080
I wasn't being stingy.
It's called being smart.

31:55.080 --> 31:57.541
Why would I mix friends
and money?

31:57.541 --> 31:59.835
So I can end up having someone
living off me

31:59.835 --> 32:01.462
like Angie does you?

32:01.462 --> 32:03.005
Hmm, do not bring me into this.

32:03.005 --> 32:04.340
It is not my fault

32:04.340 --> 32:06.133
that Quinn is being
a shady friend to Camille.

32:06.133 --> 32:08.469
What?
Oh, my God!

32:08.469 --> 32:10.638
Okay, everything is not always
about Camille!

32:10.638 --> 32:12.389
This is not the Camille Show!

32:12.389 --> 32:13.974
Ooh, shots fired!

32:13.974 --> 32:17.019
No, it's not the Camille Show,
'cause Camille is out of here!

32:17.019 --> 32:19.188
[Tye sighs]
[Angie] Millie...

32:19.188 --> 32:21.190
- Camille!
- Fuck this!

32:21.190 --> 32:24.693
Make all your friends'
exes' dresses.

32:24.693 --> 32:26.737
How could you take her side

32:26.737 --> 32:28.405
when you did the same shit
to me?

32:28.405 --> 32:31.617
You know what, Quinn?
Enjoy your business.

32:31.617 --> 32:33.702
And I can see why you're not
a good businessperson,

32:33.702 --> 32:35.663
'cause you can't even be
a good friend!

32:35.663 --> 32:36.872
- What?
- I'm out!

32:36.872 --> 32:38.499
Well, damn!

32:38.499 --> 32:40.793
Thank you, Angie.
Thank you so much.

32:40.793 --> 32:42.127
You knew I wanted
to tell Camille

32:42.127 --> 32:43.379
when the time was right!

32:43.379 --> 32:44.797
[Angie] It's hard for me
to lie.

32:44.797 --> 32:46.090
I do not lie well.

32:46.090 --> 32:47.508
[weather wives
yelling indistinctly]

32:47.508 --> 32:49.551
Can we at least
watch the end?

32:49.551 --> 32:53.180
This is the end, thanks.

32:53.180 --> 32:56.558
Y'all bitches are
too dramatic!

32:56.558 --> 32:57.851
Oh...

32:57.851 --> 32:59.853
problems...

32:59.853 --> 33:01.647
Oh, shit, now everybody crying,

33:01.647 --> 33:03.816
and then I don't know why!

33:03.816 --> 33:10.531
[singer]

34:19.141 --> 34:24.730
problems, baby...
