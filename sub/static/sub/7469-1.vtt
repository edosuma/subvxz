01:12.266 --> 01:15.137
Malcom? Have you got the
latest tidal readings from Wick?

01:15.138 --> 01:17.698
Lost the signal from the
monitoring station.

01:17.778 --> 01:21.487
What was the last reading
before we lost the signal?

01:23.098 --> 01:25.816
What? That's got to be a mistake.

01:38.698 --> 01:42.293
<i>Despite attempts to limit
loss of life and property damage...</i>

01:42.378 --> 01:44.729
<i>the residents of Maine
on the east coast face</i>

01:44.730 --> 01:48.130
<i>the grim task of cleaning
up a shattered state.</i>

01:48.138 --> 01:50.892
- The storm unleashed...
- It's a few more days.

01:50.979 --> 01:55.530
And your dad's really been
looking forward to having you over.

01:55.619 --> 01:58.008
Yes, he has!

01:58.819 --> 02:01.856
I am not patronising you.

02:02.819 --> 02:06.209
Mel? Mel?

02:07.899 --> 02:10.288
She hung up on me.

02:10.378 --> 02:13.654
Please tell me I was never like that.

02:15.539 --> 02:19.578
- More tea?
- Please. Preferably with a sedative.

02:19.659 --> 02:21.729
How about with a biscuit instead?

02:25.539 --> 02:28.292
There's water pouring through the door.

02:37.099 --> 02:39.216
Mum!

02:52.379 --> 02:54.335
Mum!

02:59.339 --> 03:01.136
Oh!

03:16.300 --> 03:17.938
Oh, no!

03:30.900 --> 03:32.856
Open!

03:35.660 --> 03:37.651
Oh!

03:42.780 --> 03:44.179
Open!

03:44.940 --> 03:47.056
Open!

05:10.942 --> 05:14.457
Your sister's going to kill me.
I promised her you'd be on time.

05:14.542 --> 05:16.976
We better hurry up, then.

05:27.541 --> 05:31.394
You need to review this. Pressure's
continuing to drop in the North Sea.

05:31.429 --> 05:35.255
Press offices are pushing for further
updates. We're inundated with requests.

05:35.342 --> 05:39.540
- I need to run the shipping forecast by you.
- OK. OK. Quiet, everyone!

05:39.622 --> 05:44.013
This storm we've been tracking for the
last few days, I need everything on it.

05:44.102 --> 05:46.377
Where it's headed, how fast.

05:46.462 --> 05:50.455
Get me the latest atmospheric
pressure reports for the Northeast.

05:50.542 --> 05:53.534
Everything you've got
from the British Oceanic Data Centre.

05:53.622 --> 05:57.581
In 40 minutes, I'm briefing
the Deputy Prime Minister.

06:08.782 --> 06:12.013
The Thames Barrier
became operational in 1983

06:12.102 --> 06:15.981
and is the largest fixed tidal
defence system in the world.

06:16.062 --> 06:19.771
It has 10 moveable gates stretching
500 meters across the river

06:19.862 --> 06:23.044
and is capable of holding back
billions of gallons of water

06:23.045 --> 06:25.284
that would otherwise
flood London.

06:25.319 --> 06:28.380
- The Barrier is what...
- Lets you sleep safely at night.

06:28.463 --> 06:30.772
Good morning.

06:30.863 --> 06:33.661
- Samantha Morrison
- You're clear.

06:33.743 --> 06:36.655
Miss Morrison, these came for you.

06:36.743 --> 06:38.859
Ha. Thank you.

06:41.703 --> 06:43.852
- Good morning, Frank.
- Boss.

06:43.942 --> 06:45.853
See the news?

06:45.942 --> 06:48.776
If you're referring to football,
I don't want to talk about it.

06:48.863 --> 06:50.501
I'm not.

06:50.583 --> 06:53.017
This will be what you're
interested in, then.

06:53.103 --> 06:57.335
Figures for the tidal gauges
at Moray and Aberdeen.

06:57.423 --> 07:01.416
Things aren't looking too clever
with this storm in Scotland.

07:08.463 --> 07:10.897
10 hours to high tide.

07:10.983 --> 07:14.693
Recalculate the tide's expected height
when it reaches London Bridge.

07:14.784 --> 07:19.300
- I'll activate the protocol for a high tide closure.
- No problem.

07:24.263 --> 07:26.857
<i>The rescue operation continues in Wick.</i>

07:26.943 --> 07:31.141
<i>Despite hazardous conditions
air rescue support is being called in</i>

07:31.223 --> 07:35.660
<i>but those in need of rescue
far outnumber available resources</i>

07:35.743 --> 07:37.541
<i>leaving many stranded on rooftops</i>

07:37.624 --> 07:42.015
The figures from Wick show the current
death toll at 21. Another 15 are missing.

07:42.104 --> 07:44.008
We can expect those
numbers to rise.

07:44.009 --> 07:47.009
We're still waiting for reports
from further along the coast.

07:47.024 --> 07:50.096
The Prime Minister is calling in
from Australia in 10 minutes.

07:50.184 --> 07:53.654
- So I need to know why we had no warning.
- Sir.

07:53.744 --> 07:56.463
Isn't this the storm that hit
the east coast of the US?

07:56.544 --> 07:58.694
Sir, forecasting is not
an exact science.

07:58.784 --> 08:03.141
- Haven't you been tracking it for 5 days?
- The storm is constantly changing.

08:03.224 --> 08:05.658
- You have models.
- With respect, sir...

08:05.744 --> 08:07.786
When a storm surge is
moving this fast, there's

08:07.787 --> 08:11.065
no means of predicting
exactly what it will do.

08:11.100 --> 08:13.702
By the time we have new data,
it's already out of date.

08:13.784 --> 08:17.857
- What's gonna happen next?
- Well, based on the available data...

08:17.944 --> 08:21.937
the storm is moving northeast
back into the North Sea.

08:22.024 --> 08:24.777
- So, the worst of it's over?
- I believe so.

08:24.864 --> 08:30.497
Though actually you can't predict what
this storm is going to do at all. Can you?

08:30.585 --> 08:33.179
I'm confident about this, sir.

08:36.505 --> 08:40.212
Deploy full emergency services
within a 50-mile radius of Wick

08:40.304 --> 08:44.422
and use all available resources to
check the sea defences below Wick.

08:44.504 --> 08:45.823
Already under way.

08:45.904 --> 08:50.420
Best try do everything we can, and
hope this time you might be right.

09:19.185 --> 09:20.538
Kate?

09:20.625 --> 09:22.878
Hi, Dad. Just calling
to remind you

09:22.879 --> 09:24.779
it's your granddaughter's
christening at 10 o'clock.

09:24.865 --> 09:27.663
- I haven't forgotten.
- Please don't be late.

09:27.745 --> 09:31.021
And, uh... Dad, just so you know...

09:31.105 --> 09:32.458
Rob's coming.

09:33.305 --> 09:35.978
- I see.
- I didn't think he'd
be able to make it but...

09:38.145 --> 09:41.741
Yes. It's been a long time.
Are you sure this is a good idea?

09:41.826 --> 09:43.179
Yes. I do.

09:43.266 --> 09:45.063
But does Rob know I'll be there?

09:45.146 --> 09:46.382
Dad, I want you there

09:46.383 --> 09:50.053
and your granddaughter wants you
there. It's a big day for her, you know.

09:50.066 --> 09:52.216
So no excuses, please.

09:52.306 --> 09:54.615
- 10 o'clock, then.
- Don't be late.

09:58.745 --> 10:02.579
Deputy Prime Minister!

10:02.665 --> 10:04.064
Good morning.

10:07.986 --> 10:10.216
Good morning, Reverend.

10:11.546 --> 10:12.899
How you holding up?

10:12.986 --> 10:15.767
Well, we're used to turbulent
weather here in Scotland.

10:15.768 --> 10:17.768
But this... this was something else.

10:17.826 --> 10:20.499
We... we just were not prepared.

10:20.586 --> 10:22.781
And why weren't
we given any warning?

10:22.866 --> 10:28.384
Sir, do you have any idea of the
fatalities we've experienced today?

10:28.466 --> 10:31.061
Sir?

10:31.147 --> 10:32.705
No. No, I haven't.

10:32.787 --> 10:35.347
Do you have any advice for us?

11:15.546 --> 11:18.902
What's your name?
What's her name?

11:18.986 --> 11:23.777
- Her name is Kirstie.
- Kirstie? That's a... very pretty name.

11:23.867 --> 11:26.256
A very pretty name.

11:28.587 --> 11:30.862
Why wasn't I informed
about Arbroath?

11:30.947 --> 11:33.795
Set up a meeting with Hopkins
from the Met Office

11:33.796 --> 11:36.496
and Fuller from the
Environment Agency.

11:36.507 --> 11:38.862
They better damn well have
an explanation!

11:45.588 --> 11:49.786
- Hey, Kate.
- Look, you'll have all the help you need.

11:49.868 --> 11:52.746
- Just in time.
- I've gotta go. Bye.

11:52.828 --> 11:56.706
- Minute to spare.
- You didn't have to come back for this.

11:56.787 --> 11:59.585
- What kind of uncle do you take me for?
- Thank you.

12:04.507 --> 12:08.136
- Waiting on someone?
- It's probably just as well.

12:08.227 --> 12:12.130
We thank You, Almighty God,
for the gift of water to sustain,

12:12.131 --> 12:14.751
refresh and cleanse all life.

12:14.828 --> 12:18.662
Over water the Holy Spirit moved
in the beginning of creation.

12:18.748 --> 12:22.900
Through water You led the children
of Israel from slavery in Egypt

12:22.988 --> 12:25.661
to freedom in the Promised Land.

12:25.748 --> 12:30.139
.. received the baptism of John,
who was anointed by the Holy Spirit

12:30.228 --> 12:32.946
as the Messiah, the Christ...

12:33.027 --> 12:35.940
We thank You, Father, for
the water of baptism.

12:36.828 --> 12:41.299
- What name have you given this child?
- Elsa Emelia.

12:41.388 --> 12:46.508
.. and know Your goodness all her days
and be protected from evil.

12:47.588 --> 12:49.943
Elsa Emelia, I baptise you

12:50.028 --> 12:52.929
in the name of the
Father, and of the Son,

12:52.930 --> 12:56.610
and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.

12:57.508 --> 12:59.943
Amen.

13:01.069 --> 13:04.061
- Hey.
- Kate.

13:04.149 --> 13:08.222
- Why didn't you tell me he'd be here?
- Cos I knew you'd react like this.

13:08.309 --> 13:12.665
And I wanted you both here. You've
hardly seen each other since Mum died.

13:12.748 --> 13:14.812
Yeah, maybe you're right,
maybe you're right.

13:14.813 --> 13:17.661
He did turn up for the funeral.
I give you that.

13:17.748 --> 13:20.308
My daughter needs a grandfather.
She deserves that.

13:21.828 --> 13:24.741
Rob, this is a new start.

13:24.829 --> 13:29.027
- I'd like us to look forwards. Be a family.
- Wait. Wait.

13:29.109 --> 13:31.907
Yeah, wait. A family?

13:31.989 --> 13:34.867
You mean like being there
when the kids are growing up?

13:34.949 --> 13:37.622
Come on. You know it
wasn't as simple as that.

13:37.709 --> 13:40.985
You should see him with Elsa.
He really does care.

13:41.069 --> 13:44.744
The only thing he cares about...
is himself.

13:45.829 --> 13:47.182
Anna.

13:47.269 --> 13:49.225
- You OK?
- Yeah. Bad day.

13:49.309 --> 13:52.540
It's about to get worse.
You need to go to the Barrier.

13:52.629 --> 13:54.699
- What?
- They're closing the gates this evening.

13:54.789 --> 13:58.304
But there's a problem, and
it needs looking at right away.

13:59.509 --> 14:02.228
- Thank you.
- Rob, you're the only one I have left.

14:02.309 --> 14:04.061
Christ! I mean... Sam's there.

14:04.149 --> 14:07.107
We're under contract.
Someone's got to check it out.

14:07.189 --> 14:10.347
Easy for you to say. You
weren't married to her.

14:10.382 --> 14:12.077
There must be someone else.
What about you?

14:12.149 --> 14:17.747
Very funny but, I'm a bit busy running your
business for you. Taxi's on its way. Bye.

14:18.330 --> 14:20.139
Yeah, thanks.

14:28.470 --> 14:32.257
Actually she's just returning to
her office. I'll get her to call you.

14:41.510 --> 14:44.024
- More coverage from Arbroath.
- Thanks.

14:44.110 --> 14:47.989
Inspector Hendrick's mum
has sent you in some cakes again.

14:48.070 --> 14:49.742
Why don't you take'em home?

14:49.830 --> 14:53.743
I don't think it's me she's
trying to fatten up, ma'am.

14:53.830 --> 14:55.866
Penny? Penny?

14:55.950 --> 14:58.828
- Get me Samantha Morrison at the Barrier.
- Will do.

15:20.230 --> 15:24.348
<i>We interrupt this programme for
breaking news from the English coast.</i>

15:24.430 --> 15:29.107
<i>The severe storm that devastated
Wick and Arbroath earlier today</i>

15:29.191 --> 15:31.546
<i>is continuing to wreak havoc further south</i>

15:31.631 --> 15:34.429
<i>having left a trail of carnage in Scotland.</i>

15:34.511 --> 15:39.187
<i>The storm is now battering the
coastal towns of northern England.</i>

15:42.471 --> 15:45.110
- Hello.
- Malcolm? Leonard Morrison.

15:45.191 --> 15:49.820
Ah, Professor Morrison. It's been a long time.
- Indeed. I have a favour to ask you.

15:49.910 --> 15:54.302
Now's not a good time. The boss is on the
warpath, and we're dealing with this storm.

15:54.391 --> 15:55.710
<i>This won't take a minute.</i>

15:55.791 --> 16:00.307
<i>Could you email me the figures from
all the tide gauges south of Aberdeen?</i>

16:00.391 --> 16:04.748
- Can I ask why you need that information?
- Let's call it professional curiosity.

16:04.831 --> 16:06.822
We can call it that.

16:06.911 --> 16:10.586
I wouldn't ask for these figures
if I didn't need them.

16:13.191 --> 16:16.308
<i>Storms continue to wreak havoc
here in the Northeast.</i>

16:16.391 --> 16:18.745
<i>Winds of 90 miles per hour</i>

16:18.746 --> 16:22.302
<i>are being recorded along some
parts of this Scottish coast.</i>

16:23.872 --> 16:28.945
Yes, just hold for a moment.
The Chairman of the US Federal Bank.

16:29.031 --> 16:30.783
Mr Moysoe, you're on speaker phone.

16:30.871 --> 16:32.304
Arthur.

16:32.391 --> 16:34.586
I'm sorry to hear about your casualties.

16:34.671 --> 16:37.018
Why, I appreciate that, Arthur.

16:37.019 --> 16:39.119
And I'll convey your sentiments
to the Prime Minister.

16:39.191 --> 16:43.231
I'm sure you're aware the dollar has
dropped a further 40 points overnight.

16:43.312 --> 16:46.270
Confidence has been lower here
since the storm damage in Maine.

16:46.352 --> 16:50.982
And we have some big players
dumping some huge quantities of stock.

16:51.072 --> 16:52.903
We could be facing a major meltdown.

16:52.992 --> 16:54.678
I'm sorry to hear that,

16:54.679 --> 16:58.274
but just at this moment we're trying
to deal with the human catastrophe.

16:58.312 --> 17:01.702
I'm just calling to let you know
you could be facing an economic one too.

17:01.792 --> 17:05.625
A couple of these guys
have started dumping UK stock.

17:05.711 --> 17:08.180
It's having a ripple effect.

17:10.551 --> 17:12.463
Thanks, Arthur. I'll talk to you later.

17:20.192 --> 17:22.406
<i>Keep my office informed of any barrier</i>

17:22.406 --> 17:25.906
<i>- operations connected to the storm's progress.
- Absolutely, ma'am.</i>

17:25.952 --> 17:29.183
Due to the high spring tide and
the storm damage in Scotland,

17:29.272 --> 17:31.263
we are planning a precautionary closure.

17:31.352 --> 17:34.390
But if anything comes up
I will certainly let you know.

17:34.473 --> 17:36.350
Thanks.

17:37.633 --> 17:39.828
Penny. Get me the Met Office.

17:39.913 --> 17:41.266
<i>Will do.</i>

17:41.353 --> 17:44.662
Commissioner, you have the
full cooperation of the Met Office.

17:44.752 --> 17:48.267
- I need to be kept informed
- I've emailed you the updates.

17:48.352 --> 17:52.265
- Thank you. Thanks for your cooperation.
- Yeah. We're on top of everything.

17:52.352 --> 17:55.185
- Professor, I'm a bit busy.
- Hear me out

17:55.272 --> 17:58.822
Those figures you sent
me for the tide gauges...

17:58.913 --> 18:01.746
- Yeah?
- Don't you think they're on the high side?

18:01.833 --> 18:05.621
It's a storm surge. Nothing
unexpected given the circumstances.

18:05.713 --> 18:08.273
I've fed the numbers into my computer model.

18:08.353 --> 18:10.821
If the surge continues to
grow at this rate...

18:10.913 --> 18:14.110
the entire east coast of England
could be in trouble.

18:14.193 --> 18:16.388
Malcolm.

18:16.473 --> 18:20.022
- What's the latest on the tidal gauges?
- Gotta go.

18:28.313 --> 18:30.383
All right.

18:30.473 --> 18:32.509
Thanks, Anna.

18:37.713 --> 18:38.941
Hi, Sam.

18:39.033 --> 18:40.944
What are you doing here?

18:41.033 --> 18:44.628
Problem on Pier 1. No one else available.

18:44.713 --> 18:49.265
Ah, right. Well, it'll do you
good to get your hands dirty.

18:51.074 --> 18:54.066
- You're looking well.
- Thanks.

18:56.594 --> 18:58.903
I hear business is good.

18:58.994 --> 19:01.063
Anna still running things for you?

19:01.153 --> 19:02.905
Well, nothing's changed.

19:02.993 --> 19:06.781
She gives the orders. I obey.

19:06.873 --> 19:09.785
Nice flowers. And I know
it's not your birthday.

19:09.873 --> 19:13.344
- I know. It's great, isn't it?
- Yeah, it's great.

19:13.434 --> 19:15.902
Does he know you hate roses?

19:17.954 --> 19:19.751
Oh, look at this.

19:19.834 --> 19:23.092
It must be my lucky day. They've sent
the big boss for me to push around.

19:23.093 --> 19:26.136
How are you, Rob?
- You're looking lovely as ever, Frank.

19:29.154 --> 19:31.224
Right. Uh... well.

19:31.314 --> 19:32.713
Shall we go?

19:32.794 --> 19:35.354
Our guys don't think
it's anything major,

19:35.434 --> 19:37.869
but with this early closure,

19:37.955 --> 19:41.469
and seeing's how we pay you
guys so much just to sit around,

19:41.554 --> 19:44.307
I thought I might call
on your services.

19:44.394 --> 19:46.350
- What do you reckon?
- Could be corrosion.

19:46.434 --> 19:48.664
- Or?
- A wear problem on the main bearings,

19:48.754 --> 19:52.383
which will affect lift capacity.
Yeah, we thought as much.

19:52.474 --> 19:54.908
Leave it with me. I'll run
some ultrasonic tests.

19:54.994 --> 19:58.543
- If it turns up positive...
- We wait 9 months for the parts to arrive.

19:58.634 --> 19:59.751
Frank...

19:59.752 --> 20:03.753
I'm at a detail on Pier 3 There's a
hydraulic problem. I need you to look at.

20:03.795 --> 20:06.025
On my way. Sorry.

20:06.115 --> 20:08.345
All right.

20:09.955 --> 20:12.310
Get your paper!

20:12.395 --> 20:16.274
There you go, darling. Thank you
very much. Storm body count rises!

20:16.355 --> 20:19.391
Storm body count rises!
Late Standard!

20:24.234 --> 20:27.671
I want to know we're not gonna
need any more body bags today.

20:27.755 --> 20:30.593
Latest figures have the
storm heading east

20:30.594 --> 20:32.794
into the North Sea, towards
the Hook of Holland.

20:32.875 --> 20:35.622
You told me this morning.
What about Arbroath?

20:35.657 --> 20:38.945
Sir, the storm is not behaving
within expected parameters.

20:39.035 --> 20:42.550
Has the danger passed?
Yes or no?

20:42.635 --> 20:44.785
It's difficult to say.

20:44.875 --> 20:49.187
If the prevailing winds
were to drive the storm south,

20:49.275 --> 20:53.713
the surge would be squeezed between
the British coastline and mainland Europe.

20:53.796 --> 20:57.344
Now, this creates a funnelling effect
and raises sea level.

20:57.435 --> 20:59.630
But that's just a worst-case scenario.

20:59.715 --> 21:04.186
Most surges lose momentum before
that. They... they just peter out.

21:04.275 --> 21:06.630
Not always, though?
No. Not always.

21:14.915 --> 21:17.350
So? What do you think?

21:17.436 --> 21:20.234
Nothing of immediate concern.
She's pretty tough.

21:20.316 --> 21:23.626
- How much longer do you need?
- What's your deadline for closure?

21:23.716 --> 21:26.389
We need you out of here
in 2 and a half hours.

21:26.476 --> 21:29.115
Well, well.
In that case...

21:30.956 --> 21:34.107
.. I'll get out of your way as
soon as possible, then, shall I?

21:40.355 --> 21:44.554
- You know I didn't mean it like that.
- Yeah, yeah.

21:46.396 --> 21:51.231
- Well, you can manage till Frank gets back?
- Oh, yeah. Don't worry about me.

21:55.116 --> 21:57.586
His name is Duncan. We've
been out a few times.

21:57.587 --> 22:01.787
I don't need to explain myself to you.
- Yeah, that's right. So why are you?

22:01.796 --> 22:05.027
- Cos you asked.
- No, I didn't.

22:06.477 --> 22:08.672
Cos you wanted to know.

22:13.357 --> 22:15.506
- He's an architect.
- Really?

22:15.596 --> 22:19.111
England are 2-nil up!

22:20.156 --> 22:22.351
2-nil...

22:22.436 --> 22:25.712
Oh, you're Canadian. Why would you care?

22:29.916 --> 22:31.828
2-nil.

22:34.837 --> 22:37.670
Is it possible that this storm
could change its course?

22:37.757 --> 22:42.626
If we did see the storm change its current
course and a severe rise in sea level,

22:42.717 --> 22:45.675
there could be flooding
down the east coast of England.

22:45.757 --> 22:49.591
- Damage estimate?
- The last time we saw something similar was

22:49.677 --> 22:51.713
1953.

22:51.797 --> 22:56.234
The storm that hit East Anglia and
Canvey Island killed 300 people on land,

22:56.317 --> 22:58.706
another 200 at sea, nearly.

22:59.557 --> 23:05.473
That surge was a body of water
4 metres high and the size of Ireland.

23:06.877 --> 23:09.311
At present, this storm
is heading out to sea.

23:09.397 --> 23:14.391
Experience suggests it would be pointless
to cause unnecessary alarm at this stage.

23:14.477 --> 23:15.990
Right!

23:16.077 --> 23:19.831
So tell me, how the hell
am I gonna reassure the public?

23:22.358 --> 23:23.916
- Steven.
- Thank you, sir.

23:23.998 --> 23:26.734
Does the Prime Minister
intend to cancel his tour

23:26.769 --> 23:28.704
and return home to deal
with this crisis?

23:28.718 --> 23:31.035
The situation is fully
under control.

23:31.036 --> 23:33.735
But, yes, the Prime Minister will
be flying home from Sydney.

23:33.797 --> 23:37.756
You can bet he's very keen to be here for
and with the British public at this time.

23:37.837 --> 23:40.635
Deputy Prime Minister!
Deputy Prime Minister!

23:40.717 --> 23:42.628
- Yes?
- Why was there no warning?

23:42.717 --> 23:46.677
Well, just at this present time we're
concentrating on managing the situation.

23:46.758 --> 23:48.828
The latest figures from
the Met Office...

23:48.918 --> 23:52.627
indicate that the storm is heading
eastwards out into the North Sea.

23:52.718 --> 23:57.746
Deputy Prime Minister, are you
saying that the danger has passed?

23:58.638 --> 24:00.276
Well, yes, yes.

24:00.358 --> 24:05.432
I'm very pleased to be able to say
that the indicators at the present time...

24:05.558 --> 24:08.436
show that our coastline
is no longer under threat.

24:08.518 --> 24:11.430
- Deputy Prime Minister
- That's the last question. Thank you.

24:12.118 --> 24:13.634
Sir?

24:18.278 --> 24:19.916
There's a gentleman in reception.

24:19.998 --> 24:22.793
I explained you were busy, but he
won't take no for an answer.

24:22.794 --> 24:24.294
He's insisting on seeing you.

24:24.318 --> 24:27.867
- Who?
- He says his name's Leonard Morrison.

24:29.438 --> 24:33.192
- Sam.
- It's OK. He's fine.

24:33.278 --> 24:37.431
- Sorry to have to trouble you.
- No, it's fine. We'll talk in my office.

24:39.639 --> 24:41.960
Tonight's is the highest tide of the year.

24:41.961 --> 24:44.161
Yeah, which is why we are
closing the barrier.

24:44.162 --> 24:47.162
My computer model is predicting
that the storm and the surge

24:47.243 --> 24:51.072
will reach the mouth of the
Thames Estuary at high tide.

24:51.158 --> 24:56.357
This means that the volume of water
moving upriver will be massively amplified.

24:56.438 --> 25:00.068
Don't underestimate the Barrier.
It's designed for problems like this.

25:00.159 --> 25:02.036
Not this much water!

25:05.279 --> 25:07.270
Sam, you know I wouldn't come here...

25:07.359 --> 25:10.669
Have you spoken with your old colleagues
at the Environment Agency?

25:10.759 --> 25:13.148
They're not taking my calls.

25:15.519 --> 25:19.751
You're saying... the confluence
of storm, surge and tide...

25:19.839 --> 25:21.511
Could be catastrophic.

25:30.679 --> 25:32.874
This doesn't make any sense.

25:32.959 --> 25:36.588
It was heading east towards Holland
2 hours ago.

25:37.479 --> 25:39.629
This wasn't meant to happen.

25:45.039 --> 25:46.995
It's heading straight for us.

25:52.040 --> 25:53.996
- Commissioner Nash.
- Sam Morrison..

25:54.080 --> 25:57.356
- Hi Sam What can I do for you?
- We may have a problem.

25:57.440 --> 26:01.149
I've got Leonard Morrison here.
He's an expert in the field.

26:01.240 --> 26:05.153
Professor Morrison has
uncovered some worrying data.

26:05.240 --> 26:10.188
According to this, it looks as though the
storm and today's spring tide could collide,

26:10.279 --> 26:15.035
resulting in a volume of water so great
that it could override the Barrier.

26:15.120 --> 26:16.838
Info.

26:16.920 --> 26:19.593
- Let me get right back to you.
- Of course.

26:37.080 --> 26:39.037
Excuse me, Leonard.

26:39.121 --> 26:41.840
Morrison's an environmental scientist.

26:41.921 --> 26:45.470
He was chief analyst at the
Flood Hazard Research Centre,

26:45.561 --> 26:48.259
and sat on a Parliamentary
advisory committee

26:48.260 --> 26:50.460
which reported on the
siting of the Barrier.

26:50.480 --> 26:54.439
The report he submitted
outlined a key flaw.

26:54.520 --> 26:57.592
He reckoned that the Barrier
was situated in the wrong place

26:57.680 --> 27:02.276
and recommended that it be built closer
to the mouth of the Thames Estuary,

27:02.360 --> 27:04.079
closer to the sea.

27:04.161 --> 27:07.823
Basically, his concern is that
under certain tidal conditions

27:07.824 --> 27:10.565
the Barrier could be overwhelmed.

27:11.641 --> 27:13.393
Get me Sam Morrison again.

27:16.561 --> 27:18.552
He just turned up.

27:18.641 --> 27:22.839
- He's here about the Barrier.
- Yeah, of course he is.

27:22.921 --> 27:25.383
Look. I know that this is
really bad timing, but

27:25.384 --> 27:28.183
we need to listen to what
your father has to say.

27:28.200 --> 27:30.761
- I don't care what he has to say.
- If this storm changes direction...

27:30.841 --> 27:33.799
Is that what this is about?
No, don't... don't tell me.

27:33.881 --> 27:39.592
Storm surge coincides with the spring
tide, and the Barrier won't hold.

27:39.681 --> 27:42.991
- Am I right?
- Yeah. I've seen the forecasting on his model.

27:43.081 --> 27:45.011
- It's a very real possibility.
- I don't believe this.

27:45.012 --> 27:47.312
You still don't get it, do you?

27:47.321 --> 27:49.551
This is an obsession!

27:49.641 --> 27:52.713
This obsession destroyed our lives!

27:52.801 --> 27:55.953
He's wrong but he could never admit it!

27:56.042 --> 27:58.078
Even though that meant
losing his own family.

27:59.122 --> 28:02.159
My mother died heartbroken
because of this.

28:03.562 --> 28:05.597
Why should I listen to him now?

28:08.841 --> 28:11.674
Just hear your father out.

28:11.761 --> 28:14.639
And you, Hopkins?
What's the latest position?

28:14.721 --> 28:20.697
The storm has dramatically altered
its course within the last hour.

28:20.882 --> 28:26.514
It's likely to hit the southeastern coast
of England later this afternoon.

28:26.602 --> 28:30.231
- Can you be more specific?
- Gales up to 80 miles an hour.

28:30.322 --> 28:33.155
So we should anticipate considerable damage.

28:33.242 --> 28:35.278
You're all missing the point.

28:35.362 --> 28:37.169
With respect, Professor Morrison,

28:37.170 --> 28:39.570
this is hardly an appropriate
forum for your theories.

28:39.642 --> 28:42.395
- According to my computer model.
- Must we?

28:42.482 --> 28:44.269
Forecasts from the Met Office and
Environment Agency

28:44.270 --> 28:46.905
haven't been very accurate so far.

28:47.002 --> 28:48.913
Sorry, Professor. Please continue.

28:49.002 --> 28:52.199
Assuming no change in wind conditions,

28:52.282 --> 28:56.514
my figures indicate that this storm,
and the tidal surge travelling with it,

28:56.602 --> 29:00.993
will reach southeast England
and the Thames Estuary at high tide.

29:01.082 --> 29:03.357
What does that mean?

29:03.442 --> 29:07.037
The combined volume of water will
overwhelm the Thames Barrier.

29:11.163 --> 29:15.839
So, what, are you saying that
central London is now at risk?

29:15.923 --> 29:18.153
I'm afraid I am.

29:18.243 --> 29:21.474
And I'm not talking
here about a single wave.

29:21.563 --> 29:24.360
This is an event that
could last for hours.

29:24.442 --> 29:27.002
So, which areas are most at risk?

29:27.082 --> 29:32.361
The danger zone includes the Docklands
Light Railways, 68 Underground stations,

29:32.442 --> 29:37.915
3 World Heritage sites at risk,
8 power stations, dozens of museums,

29:38.003 --> 29:41.359
and, of course, your location in Whitehall.

29:46.443 --> 29:48.673
What does this mean in
terms of population?

29:48.763 --> 29:50.854
Approximately one and
a half million people

29:50.855 --> 29:54.156
either live or work within
the flood danger zone.

29:56.043 --> 29:57.476
How long have we got?

29:57.563 --> 29:59.919
Figures I've received from the Met Office

30:00.004 --> 30:05.282
indicate that the storm will reach
the Thames Estuary 3 hours from now.

30:05.363 --> 30:09.242
Dear God! That's 7 o'clock this evening!
Why didn't anyone see this coming?

30:09.323 --> 30:11.473
Well, somebody did.

30:14.243 --> 30:18.873
We need to initiate evacuation
protocol immediately.

30:20.843 --> 30:23.881
The longer we delay the
decision to evacuate,

30:23.964 --> 30:28.355
the greater the risk of there
being substantial casualties.

30:35.524 --> 30:38.197
Sir?

30:38.284 --> 30:40.319
Do it.

30:47.404 --> 30:49.793
Rob!

30:49.884 --> 30:52.079
Thanks for... in there.

30:53.204 --> 30:54.876
Well.

30:54.964 --> 30:58.718
It look s like you were right.
I'm sorry I didn't believe you.

31:01.404 --> 31:04.077
In fact, I'm sorry about a lot of things.

31:21.324 --> 31:25.522
Hey! Coming back in a half an hour.
I'll win back every penny. All right?

31:25.604 --> 31:27.456
London Underground asks
that all passengers

31:27.457 --> 31:29.967
keep their belongings with
them at all times.

31:30.444 --> 31:34.596
If any bags are left unattended
they will be removed and destroyed.

31:34.684 --> 31:38.803
- Takes years of practice, of course.
- Yeah, you should maybe be on the telly.

31:38.885 --> 31:40.477
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

31:43.085 --> 31:46.316
Kate. Now, listen, I want
you to do something for me.

31:46.405 --> 31:48.236
No, don't ask questions. Just listen.

31:48.325 --> 31:52.523
Get in the car, take the family, and get
as far away from London as you can.

31:52.605 --> 31:54.880
I want you to drive as fast as you can.

31:54.965 --> 31:57.842
No, no, look, Dad... Dad's here
with me at the Barrier.

31:57.924 --> 32:00.313
Don't ask questions,
just do what I'm saying!

32:00.404 --> 32:02.555
Kate, listen, listen.

32:02.645 --> 32:05.443
Dad was right all along.

32:05.525 --> 32:07.516
Yeah.

32:07.605 --> 32:08.958
Goodbye.

32:17.845 --> 32:21.235
Track down the girls for me. They
should be leaving the cinema now.

32:21.325 --> 32:25.079
- Penny, make sure you call home too.
- Ma'am.

32:25.165 --> 32:26.679
It was my understanding...

32:26.766 --> 32:29.295
the emergency services would
receive at least 12 hours'

32:29.296 --> 32:31.196
clear warning of a major flood alert.

32:31.246 --> 32:35.524
And we've had barely 3. What
the hell have you people been doing?

32:37.485 --> 32:41.444
When this gets out, there's going to
be panic on an unprecedented scale.

32:41.525 --> 32:46.041
We have less than 3 hours
before the surge hits the Barrier.

32:46.125 --> 32:48.798
How long can we keep
the Underground running?

32:48.885 --> 32:51.319
We'll have to clear the lines
an hour before the water hits.

32:51.406 --> 32:53.874
- But that only gives us 2 hours.
- Less.

32:53.966 --> 32:55.240
To clear the tunnels by 6.20,

32:55.326 --> 32:58.682
London Underground have to
start withdrawing services at 5

32:58.766 --> 33:01.917
That's an hour from now.
Rush hour will have started.

33:02.006 --> 33:06.318
Look. Trains have to be run out to
depots, staff pulled, stations closed.

33:06.406 --> 33:08.840
Fewer trains means we're
shifting fewer passengers.

33:08.926 --> 33:12.635
Once word gets out, stations will fill
with people trying to get out of London.

33:12.726 --> 33:17.402
The trains that do get through are gonna be
full before they even reach most platforms.

33:18.286 --> 33:20.561
Right.

33:20.646 --> 33:23.285
I'm declaring a State of Emergency.

33:23.646 --> 33:26.718
The Emergency Management
Committee Cobra has...

33:26.806 --> 33:31.322
south of the River Thames..
are to be evacuated...

33:31.406 --> 33:34.716
- the City of London.
- Government advice urges those who...

33:35.866 --> 33:37.675
Get back now!

33:38.626 --> 33:41.915
Get back!

33:42.007 --> 33:44.396
Get out of the way!

33:44.487 --> 33:46.398
Lads!

33:46.927 --> 33:49.202
Get back now! Back!

33:49.287 --> 33:50.845
high ground wherever possible.

33:52.567 --> 33:55.683
Make your way
to the nearest emergency exit..

33:57.526 --> 34:01.599
.. to the lower pump room.
Gotta change a circuitboard.

34:06.447 --> 34:09.484
- Initiate the gate closure now.
- Right away, Sam.

34:25.047 --> 34:27.800
This way!

34:35.726 --> 34:39.003
Tell Frank I'm heading down
to the machine room now.

35:01.528 --> 35:04.281
Come on, Bill, where are you?

35:05.368 --> 35:09.327
I have to brief the Prime Minister
so I need a status update.

35:09.408 --> 35:14.435
The Barrier has initiated closure, and
evacuation procedures have been activated.

35:14.527 --> 35:18.016
But, sir... no population
movement on this scale,

35:18.017 --> 35:20.860
in this time frame, has ever
been attempted.

35:21.248 --> 35:24.126
We're dealing with millions of people.

35:30.008 --> 35:33.444
Leave this area Please make
your way to higher ground..

35:33.528 --> 35:38.079
If you live anywhere around a river area
make your way to higher ground..

35:41.248 --> 35:42.625
Back!

35:49.489 --> 35:52.527
The space between the gate and
the cill has reduced to 75 millimetres.

35:52.528 --> 35:54.390
We're right on target.

35:55.568 --> 35:59.527
- I couldn't get through to Kate.
- I've spoken to her. It's all right.

35:59.608 --> 36:01.997
- Sam.
- Yeah?

36:02.088 --> 36:04.841
We have to get these people out of here.
Time's moving on.

36:04.928 --> 36:09.160
Frank and the boys are refusing to go.
I'm not gonna leave without them.

36:11.169 --> 36:14.525
Please make your way to
the nearest emergency exit..

36:19.409 --> 36:23.243
Please evacuate and make your way
to the nearest emergency exit...

36:27.289 --> 36:28.847
We should get out of here.

36:28.929 --> 36:33.444
Please evacuate and make your way
to the nearest emergency exit..

36:36.649 --> 36:38.924
Please do as the soldiers ask..

36:41.569 --> 36:43.605
Please do what the soldiers say..

36:45.129 --> 36:47.562
It's going to be at least 45 minutes

36:47.563 --> 36:50.163
before all schools at risk in the
zone have been cleared.

36:50.249 --> 36:54.606
That means we may not get to the
Queen Elizabeth Hospital in time.

36:54.689 --> 36:57.920
The patient population there
approximately 2000.

36:59.690 --> 37:02.250
This came in a few moments ago, ma'am.

37:08.769 --> 37:11.237
The Suffolk coast... half an hour ago.

37:25.650 --> 37:27.845
Prioritise the schools.

37:33.890 --> 37:38.520
- Bloody hell! It's a mission getting down here.
- Yeah. Nearly there.

37:42.290 --> 37:44.326
All right.

37:44.410 --> 37:45.843
Up you go then.

37:45.930 --> 37:49.969
- Why I got to go up?
- I'm too fat.

37:50.050 --> 37:52.484
Sweet. Sweet, Bill.

37:52.570 --> 37:54.640
You do work here, don't ya?

37:56.810 --> 37:59.278
Oh! It's filthy up here, Bill.

37:59.370 --> 38:00.769
I know.

38:02.010 --> 38:04.763
Boss! You ought to look
at these tidal gauge figures.

38:04.850 --> 38:06.727
Excuse me.

38:10.170 --> 38:12.604
Put me through
to Commissioner Nash at Cobra.

38:13.610 --> 38:18.366
- Hello Sam.
- Ma'am. We'we received some new information.

38:18.451 --> 38:21.502
The surge is growing in size
and is travelling up the Estuary

38:21.503 --> 38:23.603
at a height of 4 to 6 meters.

38:23.611 --> 38:28.047
- How long have we got?
- It's a matter of minutes before it hits us.

38:28.130 --> 38:33.124
Sam. Patch all video feeds from the
Barrier through to us immediately.

38:45.051 --> 38:46.848
Oh, my God!

38:51.851 --> 38:54.001
- God.
- Sir?

39:17.251 --> 39:19.321
- I need to check on my crew.
- I'll go.

39:19.411 --> 39:21.527
- I'll go with Frank.
- No.

39:21.611 --> 39:24.444
- No time to argue.
- Let's go.

39:24.531 --> 39:26.601
We need to relocate now.

39:29.772 --> 39:32.127
Sir?

39:43.492 --> 39:45.447
Please, God, they got out.

39:59.612 --> 40:01.250
What's that?

40:03.052 --> 40:05.486
Let's get out of here!

40:09.252 --> 40:11.243
Frank!

40:16.012 --> 40:17.923
Oh, God.

40:21.013 --> 40:23.128
Oh, my God.

40:29.532 --> 40:32.490
- We need to hurry up.
- What about the others? My crew?

40:32.572 --> 40:34.927
What about Leonard?

40:37.212 --> 40:39.248
- We have to go up now.
- No!

40:39.332 --> 40:41.368
Now! We have to go up now!
No!

41:07.772 --> 41:09.650
Yeah, we're at Cobra 2.

41:09.733 --> 41:13.646
- Anything on the girls?
- I've left messages on their phones.

41:13.733 --> 41:16.770
They'll be patched through to you
the moment they call.

41:16.853 --> 41:21.051
Get me an update on the hospital and
school situation as soon as you can.

41:25.053 --> 41:28.807
- Hey, did you hear that?
- No, I don't hear anything, mate.

41:28.893 --> 41:31.009
Exactly.

41:34.374 --> 41:36.524
Hello, Control?

41:36.614 --> 41:38.605
Come in, Control.

41:40.214 --> 41:42.886
We need to get to a phone.

41:42.973 --> 41:45.328
Find out what's going on.

41:45.413 --> 41:49.326
I need to see what's happening
out there! Come on!

41:49.413 --> 41:51.051
I need pictures!

41:53.173 --> 41:57.509
Come on! We've got to
get up to the bulkhead!

42:15.254 --> 42:16.607
Rob!

42:16.694 --> 42:18.889
Leonard!

42:18.974 --> 42:22.683
- Where's Frank?
- Dad!

42:22.774 --> 42:25.004
You all right, Dad?

42:26.374 --> 42:29.810
Look! If we stay here, we're gonna die.

42:34.094 --> 42:37.450
- Come on, Dad.
- No! No, I can't! I'm sorry, I can't!

42:37.534 --> 42:39.525
Sam! It's breaking up. We've got to jump.

42:42.174 --> 42:44.290
It's all right, come on.

42:45.454 --> 42:48.049
Trust me. We're gonna be all right.

42:48.575 --> 42:52.363
- 1
- Rob, this is madness.

43:09.534 --> 43:14.245
- This was supposed to be instant plug and play.
- We're almost there, ma'am.

43:14.335 --> 43:16.451
We've got it. Sir?

43:20.535 --> 43:22.014
Jesus.

43:27.815 --> 43:29.726
Can you get in any
closer than that?

43:34.975 --> 43:38.729
- My God! Who's that?
- Switch to night vision.

43:46.695 --> 43:51.371
- It's Professor Morrison. We need him here.
- Let's get him here.

43:51.455 --> 43:54.015
All military aircraft are
committed elsewhere.

43:54.095 --> 43:57.371
Well, then, requisition a
civilian one! Top priority!

43:57.455 --> 43:58.934
Yes, ma'am.

44:04.656 --> 44:07.728
No. Morrison. What's happening?

44:09.576 --> 44:13.649
I want that Barrier signal back up!
We need to see what's happening out there.

44:16.095 --> 44:18.245
Oh!

44:33.256 --> 44:35.008
Ah!

44:36.416 --> 44:38.372
Sam!

44:38.816 --> 44:40.295
Sam!

44:41.416 --> 44:43.134
- Sir, we've got it.
- Good.

44:43.216 --> 44:45.525
Ma'am? Ma'am?

44:45.616 --> 44:47.732
You need to see this.

45:03.336 --> 45:07.488
Cobra 2? Search and Rescue 4
I think we've found your stray.

45:11.376 --> 45:13.810
Steady! Here you go!

45:15.136 --> 45:17.776
Cobra 2? Search and Rescue 4.
We're on our way.

45:17.857 --> 45:21.816
Wait... wait! No, tell him to wait!
There are 2 more people down there!

45:21.897 --> 45:25.572
No. Please! My son's down there!
He jumped! You've got to find him!

45:25.657 --> 45:28.376
No one could have survived
that. I'm sorry.

45:47.617 --> 45:49.926
Sam!

45:50.017 --> 45:52.815
Sam! This way! This way!

45:52.897 --> 45:55.616
Over here! Over here!

46:00.417 --> 46:03.409
Do you think you can
make it to the Dome?

46:03.497 --> 46:05.807
I don't know!

46:05.898 --> 46:08.731
It's all right! The current
will take us!

46:10.218 --> 46:12.731
OK? I'll be right behind you.

46:12.817 --> 46:15.968
I'm gonna let you go. All right?

46:16.057 --> 46:17.649
Go on!

46:19.337 --> 46:22.727
- I need figures from Tilbury to London Bridge.
- Commissioner?

46:22.817 --> 46:25.285
Commissioner?
How do we stand at the moment?

46:25.377 --> 46:28.608
Sir, we're up against it.
The scale of this thing, it's...

46:28.697 --> 46:32.577
- Even New Orleans can't compare.
- Sir, we need to talk about this.

46:32.658 --> 46:35.331
- What?
- I'm concerned about the security situation.

46:35.418 --> 46:38.137
Signing this will give the
military certain powers.

46:38.218 --> 46:42.370
Limited powers, to overrule civil
authorities during this State of Emergency.

46:42.458 --> 46:44.210
What?

46:44.298 --> 46:46.766
I must retain the authority
to coordinate air rescue.

46:46.858 --> 46:49.758
I need to get thousands
of civilians to safety,

46:49.759 --> 46:51.758
and I can't do that without
military assistance.

46:51.857 --> 46:56.454
All transport, all vehicles, must
remain under Cobra's command.

46:56.538 --> 46:59.439
We will work with Cobra, but I
have to ensure the security

46:59.478 --> 47:04.140
of all rescue personnel, buildings..
- Of course. - With respect, everything,

47:04.141 --> 47:07.841
including security concerns, remains
under the control of Cobra.

47:07.858 --> 47:11.086
Commissioner Nash is to be given
full military cooperation

47:11.087 --> 47:14.287
in accordance with agreed protocol.
- I'm not trying to change procedure.

47:14.298 --> 47:17.734
But if civilian unrest gets out of hand,
I have to be able to react accordingly.

47:17.818 --> 47:21.255
Yes, but cooperation is what's
needed if we're to save lives.

47:21.339 --> 47:25.491
You'll work under Cobra in all areas of the
evacuation, reporting to Commissioner Nash.

47:25.579 --> 47:27.774
Is that agreed, Major General?

47:28.739 --> 47:30.091
Yes, sir.

47:30.178 --> 47:34.330
- Where's my liaison officer?
- Behind you, ma'am.

48:13.139 --> 48:15.607
Oh!

48:20.859 --> 48:22.611
Rob!

49:23.340 --> 49:25.935
This is the old transformer
for the Northern Line.

49:34.020 --> 49:36.215
Oh, that's not right.

49:39.500 --> 49:42.412
Climb to the top of here.
See if we can't get out that way.

49:42.500 --> 49:46.413
Oh, a ladder. There's a
pattern forming here, Bill.

49:48.020 --> 49:52.219
You know what? I think you might be
one of them workplace bullies.

49:52.301 --> 49:56.294
- Not now, mate.
- You might want to see someone about that.

49:56.381 --> 49:58.133
OK, come on.

49:58.221 --> 50:01.099
No, it's locked.

50:01.181 --> 50:04.093
I am having serious second
thoughts about all this.

50:04.181 --> 50:06.136
A young lad like me,

50:06.220 --> 50:08.211
stuck underground...

50:09.060 --> 50:10.618
with a bloke...

50:12.660 --> 50:15.573
like you.

50:18.741 --> 50:20.891
- Ma'am?
- What?

50:20.981 --> 50:25.179
It seems the girls left you a message
earlier. In the confusion we didn't get it.

50:25.261 --> 50:29.812
They're meeting friends
in town after the film.

50:31.101 --> 50:32.614
In town?

50:32.701 --> 50:35.056
But... they could be anywhere.

50:35.141 --> 50:38.133
I'll keep trying to get through to them.

50:51.141 --> 50:55.692
Claire, it's me. This is officially
my 100th message.

50:57.461 --> 51:00.294
Just give me a call, darling,
whenever you can.

51:13.462 --> 51:15.896
<i>Get back! Get back!</i>

51:24.381 --> 51:27.100
<i>Come on! Come on!</i>

51:28.862 --> 51:30.818
Lock your door! Shove off!

51:30.902 --> 51:33.414
- Open the door!
- Shove off!

51:50.202 --> 51:52.500
Hang on!

51:54.423 --> 51:58.132
Commissioner, we have to shut down
the gas and electricity mains

51:58.223 --> 52:01.420
in Deptford, Kennington,
Camberwell and Bermondsey.

52:01.503 --> 52:06.292
The hospitals can only run so long on backup
gennies. We haven't got them all evacuated.

52:06.382 --> 52:10.295
It's that, or we could have
another Fire of London on our hands.

52:43.143 --> 52:45.703
Whoa!

52:49.023 --> 52:51.457
I can't hold on!

53:03.183 --> 53:06.459
- Latest evac figures.
- Status report on the Royal Family?

53:06.543 --> 53:09.616
They've been safely moved
to Balmoral, ma'am.

53:10.544 --> 53:12.853
All right. Bullet points, please.

53:12.944 --> 53:15.742
We need to look at the
time scale we're working to.

53:15.824 --> 53:18.686
Ma'am. There's no slowdown.

53:18.687 --> 53:21.286
The momentum of the surge is
enough to keep the water coming.

53:21.303 --> 53:24.454
But the wind and the rain's
adding to the problem.

53:24.543 --> 53:28.900
The Met storm forecast let us down
completely. Is this data reliable?

53:28.983 --> 53:34.297
An event on this scale is... is practically
unheard of. This is a thousand-year storm.

53:34.384 --> 53:36.261
This latest data feed is
as accurate as can be.

53:36.344 --> 53:40.098
But I need to know what further
collateral damage we can expect.

53:40.184 --> 53:44.700
If the surge maintains its current
momentum we have, I don't know... an hour?

53:44.784 --> 53:49.221
Before most of Central London
is underwater.  2 at most.

53:49.304 --> 53:51.499
What can be achieved in 2 hours?

53:58.904 --> 54:03.420
No matter how fast we work,
we're not gonna get everyone out.

54:03.504 --> 54:08.737
So we should concentrate our efforts on
the key evacuation areas in the southwest.

54:08.824 --> 54:10.701
We should deploy the
bulk of our troops

54:10.784 --> 54:15.175
and any available emergency
service personnel here... agreed?

54:15.264 --> 54:19.323
But we'll be abandoning this
corridor of people in the southeast,

54:19.324 --> 54:25.257
- Bermondsey, Lewisham.
- Given the speed this thing's moving,
we have no choice.

54:25.425 --> 54:27.780
We have to prioritise.

54:29.225 --> 54:33.264
- Focus on the southwest, Mr Bullman.
- Right.

54:33.345 --> 54:35.256
Next schedule briefing, 15 minutes.

54:35.345 --> 54:38.973
- The next press conference is scheduled
- Move it till later.

54:43.104 --> 54:45.857
Sounds like they got the
trains running again.

54:47.345 --> 54:49.176
Like no train I've ever heard.

55:02.185 --> 55:03.584
Shit.

55:04.265 --> 55:07.302
What is it? Is that
from the Thames?

55:08.505 --> 55:11.383
- What is it?
- I don't know. We got to go.

55:12.986 --> 55:15.659
- Go!
- What is it? You're freaking me out!

55:36.265 --> 55:39.941
- Come on, Bill, run!
- Christ! I'm running as fast as I can!

55:47.826 --> 55:50.465
Come on!

56:05.466 --> 56:07.218
Shit!

56:09.186 --> 56:11.575
Oh, my God!

56:17.466 --> 56:21.300
This is turning into one of the
worst natural disasters ever recorded.

56:21.386 --> 56:24.423
More than 200000 people
are still unaccounted for...

56:24.506 --> 56:27.544
and emergency services
are stretched to breaking point.

56:27.627 --> 56:32.655
- The scale of the disaster
- Professor! Are you all right? Patricia Nash.

56:32.747 --> 56:35.340
- Why have you brought me here?
- We need your help, sir.

56:35.426 --> 56:37.621
My help? I need to find my son.

56:37.706 --> 56:40.057
There's not much you can
do for him out there.

56:40.058 --> 56:42.403
Your best chance to help
him is to help us.

56:42.946 --> 56:44.538
Hm.

56:44.626 --> 56:48.141
Your Barrier Breach model,
we need access to it,

56:48.226 --> 56:50.421
and your projections for collateral damage.

56:50.506 --> 56:53.385
- They may not be relevant any more.
- Of course they are.

56:53.467 --> 56:56.539
There are millions of lives still at risk.

56:56.627 --> 56:58.265
Oh...

56:58.347 --> 57:01.541
I need access to my database
on the university server.

57:01.542 --> 57:03.242
If it's still up and running.

57:03.267 --> 57:06.543
- Can we get you anything, Professor?
- I need to find my son Rob.

57:06.627 --> 57:08.730
He's the best marine engineer
in the country.

57:08.731 --> 57:11.131
His company's under contract
to the Barrier.

57:11.187 --> 57:14.815
- Samantha Morrison...
- Is in charge of Barrier operations.

57:14.906 --> 57:17.023
- He'd head for Defiant.
- Defiant?

57:17.107 --> 57:19.188
Defiant Engineering. Rob's company.

57:19.189 --> 57:21.489
It's not far from the Barrier
but it's on higher ground.

57:21.547 --> 57:25.745
- There's just a chance they might...
- If there's a chance, we'll find them.

57:25.827 --> 57:27.977
Commissioner?

57:28.067 --> 57:29.898
This may all be too late.

57:29.987 --> 57:32.660
But we have to try.

57:35.187 --> 57:37.018
Rob!

57:37.587 --> 57:39.100
Rob!

57:39.187 --> 57:41.144
- Help us!
- Help!

57:41.228 --> 57:42.377
Sam!

57:44.748 --> 57:47.216
- Help!
- Over here!

57:47.308 --> 57:49.503
- Help!
- Sam!

57:49.588 --> 57:52.465
Over here. Help.

57:58.107 --> 58:00.667
You can't stay here!

58:00.747 --> 58:02.658
The only way out is up that way!

58:02.747 --> 58:05.136
I think we should stay here!

58:07.468 --> 58:11.700
If you don't move you're gonna die!
Quickly! Come this way, quickly!

58:17.028 --> 58:18.256
Oh!

58:26.828 --> 58:28.705
Go, go!

58:28.788 --> 58:31.063
Keep going! Keep going!

58:31.148 --> 58:33.104
The water's rising!

58:35.988 --> 58:38.900
- How long do you reckon?
- About 20 seconds.

58:43.308 --> 58:45.424
Make that 10

58:46.308 --> 58:48.617
Hurry it up!

59:05.309 --> 59:08.381
Open the door. Open the door!

59:11.188 --> 59:12.701
Come on, come on.

59:12.788 --> 59:15.063
- Put in the key!
- OK! OK!

59:22.789 --> 59:25.178
- Bill!
- Zak!

59:25.629 --> 59:27.620
- Zak!
- Bill!

59:31.909 --> 59:34.104
This way.

59:35.589 --> 59:37.227
Easy. Careful, careful.

59:37.309 --> 59:38.628
That way.

59:48.829 --> 59:52.185
- You all right?
- You OK?

59:54.349 --> 59:56.658
- Where did you lot come from?
- It's a long story.

59:56.749 --> 01:00:00.059
- It was like a tidal wave!
- A tunnel's collapsed!

01:00:00.149 --> 01:00:02.504
I'm afraid it's a lot worse than that.

01:00:03.229 --> 01:00:05.902
- Come on, we have to go! Run!
- Let's go.

01:00:05.989 --> 01:00:08.628
Let's go! Let's go!

01:00:08.709 --> 01:00:11.065
Run if you can. Come on!

01:00:12.670 --> 01:00:14.626
Quickly!

01:00:22.430 --> 01:00:26.946
- You OK?
- Hey. Somebody's coming.

01:00:28.069 --> 01:00:30.185
Mind yourself there.

01:00:30.269 --> 01:00:32.829
- They work here.
- Maybe they'll help us.

01:00:34.309 --> 01:00:37.780
- You OK?
- Yeah. That's blocked.

01:00:37.870 --> 01:00:40.464
- I don't know. I'll go and have a look.
- I tried it.

01:00:40.550 --> 01:00:42.620
OK. I'm having a look up there.

01:00:46.390 --> 01:00:49.780
Sam. Sam, wait up, wait up.

01:00:52.990 --> 01:00:57.506
There's water coming in everywhere.
We only just got away with our lives.

01:01:16.470 --> 01:01:20.463
The fire service guys have scoffed all the
biscuits as usual, so I bought you these.

01:01:20.550 --> 01:01:22.939
Tea. Coffee.

01:01:26.031 --> 01:01:28.989
They're damn smart girls, ma'am.

01:01:34.591 --> 01:01:37.105
One variable can throw
off an entire forecast.

01:01:37.191 --> 01:01:41.264
- Keith...
- The worst storm in history and I got it wrong.

01:01:41.351 --> 01:01:44.184
Keith, don't torture yourself.
We all got it wrong.

01:01:45.070 --> 01:01:50.065
People make mistakes everyday
but... mine's gonna cost lives.

01:01:51.191 --> 01:01:54.627
- Maybe thousands of them.
- You mustn't do this to yourself.

01:01:54.711 --> 01:01:57.271
No one could've predicted this, nobody.

01:01:57.351 --> 01:02:00.661
We've got to keep it together.
We've gotta do what we can now.

01:02:04.591 --> 01:02:06.980
All right. Look.

01:02:07.071 --> 01:02:09.221
I think I've got a bit of a plan.

01:02:09.951 --> 01:02:13.208
If memory serves me, about
150 metres down there,

01:02:13.209 --> 01:02:15.483
on the other side, there's
an air shaft.

01:02:15.552 --> 01:02:19.991
If it's not flooded we could perhaps
get to ground level that way.

01:02:20.072 --> 01:02:21.294
During the Blitz,

01:02:21.295 --> 01:02:25.015
hundreds of people would come down
here and use these as shelters, yeah?

01:02:25.351 --> 01:02:29.344
Government put up these massive
steel blast doors, closed them in.

01:02:29.431 --> 01:02:31.661
Sealed them in from the explosives.

01:02:31.751 --> 01:02:33.789
There's gotta be one
for this station.

01:02:33.790 --> 01:02:36.192
They're under something
official, like a Tube map.

01:02:36.227 --> 01:02:38.260
If we can find it, get it closed,

01:02:38.351 --> 01:02:41.389
it could buy us enough time to get in
that air shaft and get out, yeah?

01:02:41.472 --> 01:02:44.623
- Yeah.
- All right.

01:02:55.552 --> 01:02:57.861
Run! Run!

01:03:13.512 --> 01:03:16.629
This way, come on! Come on!

01:03:17.872 --> 01:03:20.625
Run! Keep going! Keep going!

01:03:22.272 --> 01:03:26.026
We've gotta find a latch
or a handle or something!

01:03:27.832 --> 01:03:30.063
That's it!

01:03:33.553 --> 01:03:35.589
Give me a hand!

01:03:36.473 --> 01:03:39.192
Give me a hand! Come on! That's it!

01:03:40.193 --> 01:03:42.422
Go on, mate!

01:03:45.592 --> 01:03:48.504
- Get it closed!
- Push it, Bill!

01:03:49.872 --> 01:03:51.783
It's coming again!

01:03:51.872 --> 01:03:54.262
- That's it!
- Put your weight into it!

01:03:54.353 --> 01:03:56.105
Bill!

01:03:58.273 --> 01:04:01.470
- Don't let go of me!
- Zak!

01:04:09.473 --> 01:04:11.941
- Hold it open!
- I can't!

01:04:12.033 --> 01:04:13.944
Don't let go!

01:04:21.193 --> 01:04:23.627
Now hold on!

01:04:25.353 --> 01:04:26.866
Bill!

01:05:48.914 --> 01:05:51.712
- Hey, you all right?
- Yeah.

01:05:51.794 --> 01:05:54.354
- I think I found a way out.
- OK.

01:06:03.275 --> 01:06:06.426
So this must be what Bill's talking about.

01:06:09.035 --> 01:06:11.151
Where is Bill?

01:06:24.275 --> 01:06:27.715
Commissioner Nash. The latest indications
are that the storm has turned.

01:06:27.716 --> 01:06:29.271
It's heading south.

01:06:29.306 --> 01:06:34.030
That's not the point. The crucial issue is
when will the surge lose momentum.

01:06:34.115 --> 01:06:36.390
That's what I'm saying. No storm, no surge.

01:06:36.475 --> 01:06:40.104
A surge this powerful will maintain
its own momentum, and for a long time.

01:06:40.195 --> 01:06:44.552
- What do you mean?
- It could take out the rest of the city.

01:06:44.635 --> 01:06:46.466
We haven't seen the worst of it?

01:06:46.555 --> 01:06:50.101
All of those people at the safety
points, including your rescue teams,

01:06:50.102 --> 01:06:52.804
are at high risk.

01:07:01.035 --> 01:07:02.991
Do you see that, Mr Hopkins?

01:07:04.515 --> 01:07:06.949
That's just 2 people.

01:07:07.035 --> 01:07:10.543
There are countless others
depending for their next breath

01:07:10.544 --> 01:07:14.845
on the accuracy of your
forecast, as are we.

01:07:21.996 --> 01:07:24.305
Keith.

01:07:28.676 --> 01:07:32.385
- You all right?
- It's too high!

01:07:32.476 --> 01:07:36.947
- You'll have to climb. You're not safe here.
- I really don't think I can do this.

01:07:37.036 --> 01:07:40.108
- You can do this.
- Yeah, you're gonna be fine.

01:07:40.196 --> 01:07:44.428
- You will follow me and you're gonna be fine.
- All right?

01:07:44.516 --> 01:07:46.984
All right.

01:07:47.636 --> 01:07:50.434
This is crazy. If one of us slips...

01:07:56.956 --> 01:08:01.313
By my calculations, the water will be
6 to 8 feet deep here, here,

01:08:01.396 --> 01:08:04.548
but only one or 2 feet
deep here, here, here.

01:08:04.637 --> 01:08:08.027
So these are the roads
your people should be using

01:08:08.117 --> 01:08:11.905
to get survivors to Greenwich Park
and other safety points.

01:08:11.997 --> 01:08:14.590
So these are our key
evacuation corridors.

01:08:14.676 --> 01:08:16.792
But if these are our only
access routes,

01:08:16.876 --> 01:08:21.267
land-based search and rescue in these other
areas is gonna be well nigh impossible.

01:08:21.356 --> 01:08:23.665
I need more air support.

01:08:23.756 --> 01:08:28.035
All our air support is already deployed.
Our pilots are massively overstretched.

01:08:28.117 --> 01:08:30.915
They're already flying
longer than is safe or legal.

01:08:30.997 --> 01:08:32.953
My guys aren't overstretched.

01:08:33.037 --> 01:08:37.633
You can't expect miracles from us
if this is all we've got to work with!

01:08:42.357 --> 01:08:44.871
Would you excuse me a moment?

01:08:45.917 --> 01:08:47.987
Johnson, take over.

01:09:10.716 --> 01:09:12.548
Hey!

01:09:12.636 --> 01:09:14.707
Keep your eyes on me.

01:09:29.118 --> 01:09:32.189
You're doing great.

01:09:32.277 --> 01:09:34.268
Look at me.

01:09:37.997 --> 01:09:40.796
We're doing well.

01:09:40.877 --> 01:09:43.153
I can see the end.

01:09:47.758 --> 01:09:49.157
What's going on?

01:09:50.558 --> 01:09:52.787
Zak! Zak!

01:09:52.877 --> 01:09:54.311
Zak!

01:09:54.398 --> 01:09:56.150
Give me your hand.

01:09:58.958 --> 01:10:01.677
Take my hand.

01:10:01.758 --> 01:10:03.794
Grab it.

01:10:42.479 --> 01:10:44.310
Can you see anything there?

01:10:49.998 --> 01:10:53.707
- Phone.
- I tried, the phone lines are down.

01:10:56.879 --> 01:11:00.315
Got a line.

01:11:01.599 --> 01:11:05.672
Oh, shit!

01:11:37.719 --> 01:11:40.074
Hello? Hello?

01:11:40.159 --> 01:11:42.832
Can you put me through to Cobra? Yeah.

01:11:43.959 --> 01:11:46.351
Can you repeat that?
Yes, that's right.

01:11:46.352 --> 01:11:49.052
Put them straight through.
We want to talk to them.

01:11:49.080 --> 01:11:51.548
Ma'am. I think you'll want
to take this call.

01:11:52.640 --> 01:11:56.633
- Is it Claire and Emma?
- Claire?

01:11:57.880 --> 01:11:59.711
I'm sorry?

01:12:00.360 --> 01:12:03.272
Yes, um... that's fantastic news.

01:12:03.960 --> 01:12:07.093
Hang on one second. There's
someone here you should be talking to.

01:12:07.094 --> 01:12:11.595
I'll pass you over. It's for you.
- Morrison here.

01:12:11.600 --> 01:12:14.194
Dad, it's you!

01:12:14.280 --> 01:12:16.874
Rob.

01:12:16.960 --> 01:12:19.633
Oh, thank God. Rob.

01:12:19.720 --> 01:12:22.109
Dad! I thought you were...

01:12:22.200 --> 01:12:26.637
I'm still here. I just can't believe
it's you. Where... where are you?

01:12:26.720 --> 01:12:29.632
We're in central London,
or what's left of it.

01:12:29.720 --> 01:12:32.837
- We? Is Sam with you?
- Yeah, yeah. Yeah, she's here.

01:12:32.920 --> 01:12:37.756
Rob, I may need your help. Stay where
you are. They'll be able to trace this call.

01:12:37.841 --> 01:12:40.892
I'll make sure you're both
picked up as soon as possible.

01:12:40.893 --> 01:12:42.893
I can't tell you how relieved I am.

01:12:42.921 --> 01:12:44.354
Me too.

01:12:44.441 --> 01:12:47.398
I need to speak to Sam.
Can you put her on?

01:12:47.480 --> 01:12:49.710
Yeah. Sam.

01:12:49.800 --> 01:12:53.270
Leonard! Oh, God, it's so
good to hear your voice!

01:12:53.360 --> 01:12:55.669
- Sam about the Barrier...
- What?

01:12:55.760 --> 01:12:59.116
- Do you think it's still operational?
- Uh...

01:12:59.200 --> 01:13:03.114
Oh God, well, I can't imagine
the Barrier is in very good shape.

01:13:03.201 --> 01:13:06.238
Is there any way we could
open the gates manually?

01:13:06.321 --> 01:13:09.445
Well, yeah. No, no, you could
override the auto setup.

01:13:09.446 --> 01:13:11.546
But I think access
would be an issue.

01:13:11.561 --> 01:13:14.439
Sam. I think the Barrier
is our answer.

01:13:14.521 --> 01:13:16.113
What's the problem?

01:13:16.201 --> 01:13:18.715
But we need to rendezvous
at Defiant first

01:13:18.801 --> 01:13:20.473
OK.

01:13:21.561 --> 01:13:24.200
Although the surge is still
ploughing its way upriver,

01:13:24.281 --> 01:13:26.590
if we lower the Barrier,

01:13:26.591 --> 01:13:30.691
the water upriver can
drain into the Estuary.

01:13:30.721 --> 01:13:36.478
What we then need is a force which in effect
increases the rate at which the tide ebbs.

01:13:37.481 --> 01:13:40.837
- Is that something we can create?
- There may be a way.

01:13:41.801 --> 01:13:45.555
To stop the surge, I think we
should open these sluice gates.

01:13:45.641 --> 01:13:48.633
Let the whole lot flush downstream.

01:13:48.721 --> 01:13:51.395
We'll need exact timings
from the Met Office,

01:13:51.482 --> 01:13:55.157
so that the whole operation
coincides with the ebbing of the tide.

01:13:56.282 --> 01:13:58.530
But if we open the sluice gates,

01:13:58.565 --> 01:14:02.202
wouldn't we be releasing even
more water into the flood plain?

01:14:02.242 --> 01:14:05.233
Of course, but if you get the
timing right, with the Barrier open,

01:14:05.321 --> 01:14:09.394
we'll have the water from the sluice
gates counteracting the surge,

01:14:09.481 --> 01:14:13.633
and the outgoing tide
pulling it back down the Estuary.

01:14:15.442 --> 01:14:17.160
Hopkins?

01:14:17.642 --> 01:14:20.315
Where the hell's Hopkins?
I need him here.

01:14:24.882 --> 01:14:28.716
Get me the Waterways Manager.
It's Commissioner Nash.

01:14:42.962 --> 01:14:46.352
- Zak.
- Yeah.

01:14:46.442 --> 01:14:48.637
We're gonna go now.

01:14:48.722 --> 01:14:51.634
I want you to stay and
look after the others.

01:14:52.722 --> 01:14:54.155
OK?

01:14:54.242 --> 01:14:55.960
You'll be safe here.

01:14:56.042 --> 01:14:58.033
Someone will come soon.

01:14:59.442 --> 01:15:01.637
All right?

01:15:01.722 --> 01:15:03.793
Yeah.

01:15:04.843 --> 01:15:08.722
- Thank you.
- No.

01:15:08.803 --> 01:15:10.998
Thank you.

01:15:17.323 --> 01:15:19.075
Sam.

01:15:30.803 --> 01:15:36.241
Sir. Safety points are filling up. We're
running out of fresh drinking water.

01:15:36.323 --> 01:15:39.235
We'll need to requisition more transport
within the next 30 minutes.

01:15:39.323 --> 01:15:41.780
Right, but make sure you
coordinate with Ashcroft.

01:15:41.781 --> 01:15:44.081
Oh, I'm due to speak to
the PM shortly.

01:15:44.123 --> 01:15:46.876
Do we know yet how many
people didn't get out?

01:15:46.963 --> 01:15:50.353
The latest estimate is, um... 200,000, sir.

01:16:12.803 --> 01:16:15.192
It's Hopkins.

01:16:15.283 --> 01:16:19.197
- What about him?
- His... body's just been found.

01:16:19.284 --> 01:16:22.162
What? How could...

01:16:24.484 --> 01:16:27.954
- I should have seen this coming.
- Oh, no.

01:16:28.044 --> 01:16:29.921
I'm sorry.

01:16:31.324 --> 01:16:33.440
Oh...

01:17:24.724 --> 01:17:27.192
So we ask for your prayers...

01:17:27.284 --> 01:17:32.119
for those who are braving terrible
conditions in a bid to save lives.

01:17:36.365 --> 01:17:40.278
This is just the start of a terrible
day of reckoning for London.

01:17:40.365 --> 01:17:43.118
Rescue services are
highly stretched

01:17:44.365 --> 01:17:47.675
and we have to face
the consequences

01:17:47.765 --> 01:17:49.960
They're preparing us for the worst.

01:17:50.045 --> 01:17:55.358
Loss of life on this scale is something
we've never experienced before in this city.

01:17:55.445 --> 01:18:00.235
I believe London will survive,
and we will recover.

01:18:00.325 --> 01:18:01.758
Thank you.

01:18:01.845 --> 01:18:04.598
Jesus, they don't think
anyone made it.

01:18:06.285 --> 01:18:09.277
It's not as if they're gonna
be out looking for us.

01:18:33.486 --> 01:18:35.840
May I join you?

01:18:38.885 --> 01:18:41.922
Our only reason for being
here is to save lives.

01:18:43.165 --> 01:18:45.838
God knows how many
we've lost out there.

01:18:48.006 --> 01:18:51.442
we've failed... or I did.

01:18:51.526 --> 01:18:54.245
You've done everything
humanly possible.

01:18:54.326 --> 01:18:57.636
Countless people owe their
lives to you,

01:18:57.726 --> 01:18:59.796
including me.

01:19:02.366 --> 01:19:06.757
You've seen the pictures.
Who could survive that?

01:19:06.846 --> 01:19:08.802
My girls are out there.

01:19:08.886 --> 01:19:11.799
I don't even know
where they are.

01:19:21.286 --> 01:19:22.604
This all look s great, but in

01:19:22.605 --> 01:19:25.605
real life we're dealing with
massive unpredictable forces.

01:19:25.646 --> 01:19:30.117
I don't care what your model says. There's
no way we can predict what's gonna happen

01:19:30.206 --> 01:19:32.766
when these 2 bodies of
water come together.

01:19:32.846 --> 01:19:34.996
It's a hell of a risk, ma'am.

01:19:35.086 --> 01:19:38.032
And the chances of it working out
the way the professor think s it will,

01:19:38.033 --> 01:19:41.833
must be a million to one.
- Leonard?

01:19:41.887 --> 01:19:46.517
I've taken all known variables into
consideration including the issue of timing.

01:19:46.607 --> 01:19:49.041
I think my plan will work.

01:19:49.127 --> 01:19:52.085
Blind faith in computer models
is what got us into this mess.

01:19:52.167 --> 01:19:56.000
- Ignoring computer models...
- Please. What are the timing issues?

01:19:56.086 --> 01:19:59.681
Low tide at the barrier is 10.45 am.

01:20:03.327 --> 01:20:08.924
For this to work we have to open
the sluice gates at precisely 9.15.

01:20:09.847 --> 01:20:13.760
The Barrier gates will have to be lowered
before the sluice gate waters reach them.

01:20:13.847 --> 01:20:15.997
The Barrier is not currently operational.

01:20:16.087 --> 01:20:18.521
Yeah, but I've spoken with
Samantha Morrison.

01:20:18.607 --> 01:20:21.838
There is a way of lowering the Barrier
but we don't have much time.

01:20:21.927 --> 01:20:26.206
If the Barrier gates can't be lowered then
the plan with the sluice gates won't work.

01:20:32.847 --> 01:20:35.202
We'd be gambling with
millions of lives.

01:20:40.807 --> 01:20:43.673
So you're asking me to
open the sluice gates,

01:20:43.674 --> 01:20:45.574
unleashing millions of
gallons of water,

01:20:45.647 --> 01:20:49.845
before we know for sure
whether we can lower the Barrier.

01:20:49.927 --> 01:20:52.044
How sure are you?

01:20:53.408 --> 01:20:57.162
I'm sending my son and daughter-in-law
to the Barrier.

01:20:57.248 --> 01:20:59.967
Does that answer your question?

01:21:03.088 --> 01:21:06.603
I need to brief the DPM before
we do this. Richardson?

01:21:06.688 --> 01:21:08.804
Ma'am.

01:21:26.688 --> 01:21:28.963
- How's it going?
- All set.

01:21:30.768 --> 01:21:34.363
Anyway, I kind of, um...

01:21:34.448 --> 01:21:36.598
don't want us to be apart any more.

01:21:47.009 --> 01:21:49.317
Let's go.

01:22:04.248 --> 01:22:07.366
Dad! They found us!

01:22:07.449 --> 01:22:09.201
Help!

01:22:09.289 --> 01:22:13.328
Help us! Help! Help!

01:22:15.649 --> 01:22:17.367
Help us!

01:22:20.289 --> 01:22:24.441
Makeshift messages on rooftops
like this one here at Canary Wharf

01:22:24.529 --> 01:22:26.759
- are starting to appear all over London
- Ma'am?

01:22:26.849 --> 01:22:31.639
This outlines manpower on the sluice gates.
- 200,000 people were still in the flood zone

01:22:31.729 --> 01:22:34.163
when the Thames reached its banks.

01:22:34.249 --> 01:22:37.480
Just when we thought that
no one could have survived.

01:22:37.569 --> 01:22:42.404
thousands of people are holding
up signs telling us they're alive.

01:22:43.249 --> 01:22:47.686
Tens of thousands of people still don't
know where they'll be sleeping tonight

01:22:47.769 --> 01:22:51.364
But at least for now London
can breathe a sigh of relief,

01:22:51.449 --> 01:22:57.207
as the monster surge that overwhelmed
the city literally begins to drain away

01:22:58.810 --> 01:23:01.802
Help! Help!

01:23:01.890 --> 01:23:05.929
Sir? I need the go-ahead.
We're running out of time.

01:23:06.010 --> 01:23:08.670
I've already spoken to
the Prime Minister about it.

01:23:08.671 --> 01:23:11.671
But I need to know, is
this our only option?

01:23:11.769 --> 01:23:15.921
I'm afraid so, or we do nothing. I'm
sure you'll agree that is not an option.

01:23:16.009 --> 01:23:19.638
There's no guarantees that this
will work but this is our only hope.

01:23:19.729 --> 01:23:22.528
- But the key thing is we...
- Sir, we need a decision.

01:23:22.610 --> 01:23:26.046
With the high risk of failure, sir,
we cannot take this action.

01:23:26.130 --> 01:23:28.724
Sir?

01:23:28.810 --> 01:23:31.608
We're out of options.
We need to do this.

01:23:34.370 --> 01:23:37.043
Minister, I'll go to the barrier myself.

01:23:49.530 --> 01:23:50.883
Go ahead.

01:24:02.050 --> 01:24:04.006
Wait your turn.

01:24:08.050 --> 01:24:09.962
Please.

01:24:18.491 --> 01:24:21.164
Come on! Come on!

01:24:21.251 --> 01:24:23.924
All right! Keep moving!

01:24:26.810 --> 01:24:29.529
Move it. Move it.

01:24:29.610 --> 01:24:31.089
Move that way!

01:24:33.250 --> 01:24:36.482
- Ma'am!
- What's the matter?

01:24:36.571 --> 01:24:41.725
The girls have been picked up by a mobile
search and rescue unit. They're safe.

01:24:41.811 --> 01:24:43.290
Oh...

01:24:45.531 --> 01:24:47.328
Thank you.

01:24:49.411 --> 01:24:53.006
- I haven't lost my kids.
- They're all that matter.

01:25:42.891 --> 01:25:45.200
It's good to see you, Dad.

01:25:52.252 --> 01:25:55.164
Let's go, let's go!

01:25:58.092 --> 01:26:01.126
Come on, get some effort in
there. Put your back into it!

01:26:01.127 --> 01:26:04.727
- Give him a hand on there, come on.
- Commander Bryant,

01:26:04.812 --> 01:26:06.464
if we don't open
the Barrier in time,

01:26:06.465 --> 01:26:09.965
our ability to manage this
disaster will be nonexistent.

01:26:09.972 --> 01:26:14.205
- In 2 hours this control centre will be taken out.
- I understand, ma'am.

01:26:14.293 --> 01:26:16.853
- Give me Professor Morrison.
- Certainly, ma'am. Professor?

01:26:18.933 --> 01:26:22.607
- Commissioner?
- Professor The surge is moving further inland.

01:26:22.692 --> 01:26:25.160
- Are you sure?
- It shows no sign of stopping

01:26:25.252 --> 01:26:29.484
- Has Fuller downloaded the latest projections?
- Yes.

01:26:30.812 --> 01:26:34.122
- We're counting on you, Leonard.
- Understood.

01:26:37.572 --> 01:26:40.406
What we're trying to do
is very dangerous.

01:26:40.493 --> 01:26:42.609
I'll take the risk, Dad.

01:26:42.693 --> 01:26:46.481
No one knows the Barrier
like me. It's my job.

01:26:46.573 --> 01:26:49.246
I won't let anyone else
take my place.

01:26:50.453 --> 01:26:52.409
Rob.

01:26:52.493 --> 01:26:55.451
- I know I haven't been much of a father.
- Dad, don't.

01:26:55.933 --> 01:26:59.369
- I wasn't much of a husband either.
- Dad, don't.

01:26:59.453 --> 01:27:02.922
It's obvious now why the
work meant so much.

01:27:04.093 --> 01:27:06.129
I'm sorry I doubted you.

01:28:18.094 --> 01:28:22.087
This is where we are in the
back-up control room.

01:28:22.174 --> 01:28:24.210
This is the room we need to get to.

01:28:24.294 --> 01:28:27.969
It houses the manual override which
will allow us to drain the latch room.

01:28:28.054 --> 01:28:30.488
The problem is that this
room will be flooded

01:28:30.574 --> 01:28:34.149
and there's a good chance that all
these access routes are under water.

01:28:34.234 --> 01:28:35.880
What do you suggest?

01:28:35.881 --> 01:28:39.746
The sluice gates upriver have
been opened. We're on a clock here.

01:28:39.781 --> 01:28:43.574
We need to drain the latch room to operate
the hydraulics that will open the Barrier.

01:28:43.655 --> 01:28:48.490
Now, even if we do make it
as far as the override room,

01:28:48.575 --> 01:28:52.648
the Barrier's anti-terrorist motors will
activate and there will be no way back out.

01:28:53.695 --> 01:28:57.892
The drainage system is only operable
when the room is sealed from the inside.

01:29:01.134 --> 01:29:04.251
Whoever goes into this room
is gonna run out of air

01:29:04.334 --> 01:29:08.089
before the door can be re-opened
from the other side.

01:29:10.255 --> 01:29:12.325
This is a death sentence.

01:29:14.535 --> 01:29:19.450
This is madness. We need a
contingency if they don't succeed.

01:29:19.535 --> 01:29:21.366
What do you suggest?

01:29:21.455 --> 01:29:25.448
There is only one option, ma'am.
The Barrier gates must be destroyed.

01:29:25.535 --> 01:29:28.572
- We don't have the authority.
- I'll get it.

01:29:42.135 --> 01:29:46.048
Sam. I can't let you do this.

01:29:46.135 --> 01:29:50.128
Whatever happens on this Barrier
is my responsibility.

01:29:50.215 --> 01:29:53.127
- I have to.
- Sam, listen...

01:29:53.215 --> 01:29:58.734
This is no longer a civilian responsibility.
As senior officer here it's my duty.

01:29:58.816 --> 01:30:03.446
I need you both here
to operate the latch release.

01:30:03.536 --> 01:30:05.527
I've made my decision.

01:30:19.775 --> 01:30:21.731
Commander.

01:30:22.776 --> 01:30:26.291
You're a brave man but we
both know it can't be you.

01:30:27.576 --> 01:30:31.171
You don't know this Barrier
well enough.

01:30:31.256 --> 01:30:33.816
It makes sense.

01:30:46.536 --> 01:30:47.890
- Sam.
- No.

01:30:47.977 --> 01:30:50.127
- Listen.
- No, I won't. Why?

01:30:50.217 --> 01:30:53.765
You know why. He doesn't know
enough to go down there.

01:30:56.656 --> 01:30:59.454
Rob, I'm asking you...

01:31:05.176 --> 01:31:07.212
It's our only choice.

01:31:15.777 --> 01:31:18.814
That means you maintain your formation

01:31:18.897 --> 01:31:22.606
Prime Minister, all our aircraft
are fully armed and fuelled.

01:31:22.697 --> 01:31:25.814
I must reiterate, time is of the essence.

01:31:25.897 --> 01:31:28.086
I don't need to be reminded of that.

01:31:28.087 --> 01:31:30.887
What is the status of the
rescue operation at the Barrier?

01:31:30.897 --> 01:31:34.455
It's difficult to tell. We're having
communication problems

01:31:34.456 --> 01:31:37.104
with the team on the ground.
- That's all we need.

01:31:37.139 --> 01:31:40.891
I don't want our handling of this crisis
to come under any more question.

01:31:40.977 --> 01:31:43.286
We are monitoring it minute by minute.

01:31:43.377 --> 01:31:48.087
Major General, your aircraft are to remain
on the ground at the present time.

01:31:48.177 --> 01:31:51.374
Deputy Prime Minister,
get me a reason to delay this.

01:32:16.377 --> 01:32:18.527
No, don't.

01:32:25.977 --> 01:32:28.253
Dad!

01:32:31.938 --> 01:32:33.132
Dad!

01:32:34.558 --> 01:32:37.334
Open the door! Open the door!

01:32:43.378 --> 01:32:45.528
Dad!

01:33:19.419 --> 01:33:21.933
Commissioner, the Prime Minister for you.

01:33:23.859 --> 01:33:26.817
- Prime Minister.
- Commissioner, I need an update.

01:33:26.899 --> 01:33:30.049
Surge waters are continuing
to work their way up stream.

01:33:30.138 --> 01:33:33.096
Their momentum has slowed
but we have major damage

01:33:33.178 --> 01:33:35.707
and further potential loss of life...

01:33:35.708 --> 01:33:39.008
at Chelsea, Clapham, Hammersmith
and Putney.

01:33:39.098 --> 01:33:41.818
And the sluice gate waters
to combat this surge?

01:33:41.899 --> 01:33:43.457
Current estimates suggest

01:33:43.539 --> 01:33:45.928
the confluence between
the sluice gate waters

01:33:45.929 --> 01:33:47.929
and the surge in less
than 30 minutes.

01:33:47.979 --> 01:33:52.131
It's not enough Commissioner
You're giving me very few options.

01:34:07.659 --> 01:34:10.731
Ma'am. Commander Bryant's
on the line from the Barrier.

01:34:10.819 --> 01:34:13.777
- Good.
- Signal's been patched here.

01:34:13.859 --> 01:34:17.135
- Commissioner Nash, are you receiving me?
- Yes. Yes.

01:34:17.219 --> 01:34:20.973
We're under pressure from
the Prime Minister and the military.

01:34:21.059 --> 01:34:23.334
Unless you can give me
something concrete,

01:34:23.419 --> 01:34:26.806
we have less than 10 minutes before
aircraft are ordered to take off

01:34:26.807 --> 01:34:28.948
and destroy the Barrier.

01:34:29.299 --> 01:34:33.851
Ma'am, Professor Morrison is currently
trying to engage the manual override system.

01:34:33.940 --> 01:34:35.373
He may need more than 10 minutes.

01:34:35.460 --> 01:34:38.099
- I need an exact time.
- I can't be more precise.

01:34:38.180 --> 01:34:41.809
- You don't know when he'll be back?
- Buy me all the time you can, ma'am.

01:34:41.900 --> 01:34:44.494
Professor Morrison won't be coming back.

01:35:09.700 --> 01:35:11.577
OK, let's go.

01:35:15.220 --> 01:35:18.292
Help me prime these gates.
Pull down, and up.

01:35:26.620 --> 01:35:31.171
We've begun priming the gates. As soon
as it's completed I can open the Barrier.

01:35:31.260 --> 01:35:32.693
- Sam
- 2 minutes.

01:35:32.780 --> 01:35:35.340
- The Prime Minister.
- Hang on one moment.

01:35:38.580 --> 01:35:42.175
I'm through to the Barrier. They have
to prime the gate before it can open.

01:35:42.260 --> 01:35:44.757
Prime Minister, we need to get
the aircraft to the Barrier now.

01:35:44.758 --> 01:35:46.612
We're running out of time.

01:35:47.541 --> 01:35:49.611
Good God!

01:35:56.741 --> 01:35:58.618
We need a decision

01:35:58.701 --> 01:36:02.694
Major General, you have my
authority to destroy the Barrier.

01:36:02.781 --> 01:36:05.169
What!?

01:36:05.260 --> 01:36:07.330
We have a go. You're
clear for takeoff.

01:36:08.300 --> 01:36:10.098
We're clear for takeoff.

01:36:15.301 --> 01:36:17.895
Sam, you all have to get
out of there now.

01:36:17.981 --> 01:36:20.370
It's too late ma'am.
We're gonna finish this.

01:36:21.541 --> 01:36:24.055
- Come on.
- It's only a matter of minutes.

01:36:28.701 --> 01:36:30.453
That's it.

01:36:33.501 --> 01:36:34.651
Follow me.

01:36:46.021 --> 01:36:47.898
OK.

01:36:52.661 --> 01:36:56.051
Cobra 2, we're minutes
away from the Barrier.

01:37:14.622 --> 01:37:19.013
- Commissioner Nash, status report.
- Bear with me a few moments, Prime Minister.

01:37:34.462 --> 01:37:35.941
- Barrier.
- Sam.

01:37:36.022 --> 01:37:39.332
- The gates are opening! They've done it.
- The gates are opening.

01:37:39.422 --> 01:37:42.971
- Stand them down, Ashcroft.
- Abort. I repeat, abort.

01:37:43.062 --> 01:37:45.451
Disengage! Abort! Abort now!

01:38:26.343 --> 01:38:28.652
Oh...

01:38:53.263 --> 01:38:56.573
- Stand back there, please.
- Stand back.

01:39:43.704 --> 01:39:46.093
Thank you.

01:39:57.144 --> 01:39:59.100
He left you this.

01:40:09.984 --> 01:40:12.214
He loved you.

01:40:39.504 --> 01:40:41.779
I'm sorry, Dad.

01:40:55.025 --> 01:40:57.220
Take my father home.
