Previously on
<i>Pretty Little Liars.</i>

00:04.971 --> 00:06.108
Is this a bad time?

00:06.109 --> 00:07.157
What are you doing here?

00:07.158 --> 00:08.568
My doctors released me.

00:08.568 --> 00:10.064
The cops still don't
know who killed Garrett.

00:10.065 --> 00:11.726
They can't even find the
gun he was shot with.

00:11.727 --> 00:13.460
Why do you obsess about this stuff?

00:13.461 --> 00:16.229
Does Mona have something on you, Lucas?
Did you do something?

00:16.230 --> 00:19.007
Mona's up to something. We need
to bust into creepy's closet

00:19.008 --> 00:20.175
and see what else he saved for her.

00:20.176 --> 00:22.299
This isn't Mona's. This is Ali's.

00:22.560 --> 00:23.811
Did you ever ask your dad

00:23.812 --> 00:25.778
about him meeting up with Ali that night?

00:25.779 --> 00:26.559
Garrett lied about a lot.

00:26.560 --> 00:29.029
Why are we suddenly gonna
believe anything he said?

00:30.907 --> 00:31.560
How's Meredith?

00:31.561 --> 00:34.498
Did you and your friends do this to her?

00:34.499 --> 00:36.692
"A" set us up. That's why
Meredith opened that shed.

00:36.693 --> 00:38.868
"A" sent her over there and
made it look we did it.

00:40.640 --> 00:41.714
You've killed her.

00:44.380 --> 00:45.850
I've never seen a dead body before.

00:47.795 --> 00:48.977
You killed her.

00:52.516 --> 00:53.991
I think I've seen this one before.

00:55.488 --> 00:57.075
Why don't you say something?

00:59.457 --> 01:00.736
Why did you phone back?

01:03.031 --> 01:06.533
Listen, I wanted to talk to you
about that explosion at school.

01:06.534 --> 01:07.726
We've already talked.

01:08.084 --> 01:10.968
No, wait, you talked, I got accused.

01:11.007 --> 01:12.946
Meredith got a call from the principal.

01:12.947 --> 01:15.346
He believes they found
out who was behind it.

01:17.688 --> 01:21.680
And I know that you are still upset at me

01:21.681 --> 01:23.937
for thinking that you
were somehow involved.

01:25.043 --> 01:27.426
And I just wanted to say that I'm sorry.

01:34.855 --> 01:37.927
- Find you out.
- This is why you've come back.

01:38.631 --> 01:39.955
I have seen this one.

01:40.147 --> 01:42.274
That guy keeps a severed head in a hatbox.

01:42.801 --> 01:44.371
I had to find you out.

01:49.085 --> 01:50.222
Now I have.

01:51.179 --> 01:52.975
You've come back here to be alone with me,

01:54.002 --> 01:57.605
same as you was there in the kitchen
the other night, didn't you?

02:04.385 --> 02:05.697
Either there's something in that journal

02:05.698 --> 02:07.735
that explains why Aria's
dad would meet up with Ali

02:07.736 --> 02:11.134
the night she died, or we have
to believe Garrett's story.

02:11.684 --> 02:13.373
We couldn't do this at lunch tomorrow?

02:13.701 --> 02:16.400
Do you wanna run into Harold and
his rusty bolt cutter again?

02:16.532 --> 02:18.659
The school basement is creepy at night.

02:23.355 --> 02:25.113
How does this prove anything Garrett says?

02:25.114 --> 02:26.840
He was in Ali's room that night.

02:27.142 --> 02:29.708
Maybe he just made that stuff
up from reading her journal.

02:30.618 --> 02:32.975
Why? To stop us from thinking he did it?

02:33.098 --> 02:35.439
Garrett was shot because he talked.

02:35.646 --> 02:37.606
Kinda makes me believe he
was telling the truth.

02:38.045 --> 02:40.081
I really hope it's not
true about Aria's dad.

02:40.438 --> 02:42.193
I have enough daddy issues of my own.

02:42.194 --> 02:44.405
I can't deal with having
issues about hers, too.

02:46.310 --> 02:48.666
All right, you guys go in. I'll keep watch.

02:57.408 --> 02:58.503
You hit the switch.

03:03.261 --> 03:04.388
I can't find it.

03:07.704 --> 03:08.933
There's somebody in here.

03:12.750 --> 03:13.890
Hanna, look out!

03:15.705 --> 03:18.033
- Did you see anything?
- I didn't get a good look.

03:21.313 --> 03:22.312
Guys.

03:25.543 --> 03:27.923
- Where's all of Harold's stuff?
- It's like he was never here.

03:28.512 --> 03:30.368
Look, there's Ali's journal.

03:32.902 --> 03:34.165
- Come on, let's go.
- No, wait.

04:05.001 --> 04:07.001

04:10.303 --> 04:11.019
Soy?

04:11.020 --> 04:12.394
Unsweetened, no foam.

04:12.395 --> 04:13.669
You deserve a medal.

04:17.345 --> 04:19.784
You guys, I tossed and turned all night.

04:20.384 --> 04:23.794
I'd wake up from a dream about
keep secrets from Ezra,

04:23.795 --> 04:24.984
and then I'd fall asleep and

04:24.985 --> 04:27.093
I would dream about
falsely accusing my dad.

04:28.143 --> 04:30.563
Weirdly, both of them ended
with my teeth falling out.

04:30.766 --> 04:32.198
Anxiety dreams.

04:32.326 --> 04:34.842
In mine, usually there's always
a piece of gum in my hair,

04:34.843 --> 04:37.362
and I just keep pulling and
pulling until I'm bald.

04:37.821 --> 04:39.208
Academic decathlon.

04:39.534 --> 04:40.869
I show up to state finals

04:40.870 --> 04:42.757
with my underwear on the outside.

04:42.994 --> 04:44.602
Are you still gunning for team captain?

04:44.728 --> 04:45.654
Didn't you hear?

04:45.655 --> 04:47.805
Brad Langfield got into a bike accident.

04:48.526 --> 04:50.225
He's gonna need physical therapy.

04:50.509 --> 04:53.904
The very grim upside is
that I'm running unopposed.

04:55.150 --> 04:56.911
Are you the only one of us that got sleep?

04:56.919 --> 04:58.981
Are you kidding? After last night?

04:59.156 --> 05:02.687
- So everything's gone?
- Everything but a fake diary.

05:02.783 --> 05:05.204
We've gotta talk to my mom about
where my dad was that night.

05:05.291 --> 05:07.657
My teeth actually feel
kinda loose right now.

05:08.327 --> 05:11.544
Hey, ladies. Losing sleep?

05:12.074 --> 05:13.224
Me, too.

05:13.617 --> 05:15.307
What exactly are you talking about?

05:16.201 --> 05:17.965
Remember that creepy Harold guy,

05:18.389 --> 05:19.831
from the lost woods motel?

05:19.980 --> 05:21.095
What about him?

05:21.096 --> 05:23.920
He was at our school, stalking me.

05:24.507 --> 05:27.059
He bribed the real custodian
so he could have the job.

05:27.060 --> 05:28.575
Why would he be stalking you?

05:29.266 --> 05:31.163
I used to talk to him once in a while,

05:31.394 --> 05:33.399
and he sort of ran with it.

05:33.923 --> 05:35.628
When I told him it was inappropriate,

05:35.629 --> 05:36.922
he didn't take it so well.

05:38.137 --> 05:39.945
And after what happened at the 10k,

05:39.946 --> 05:41.504
I told my parents,

05:41.924 --> 05:43.741
and we went to the school administration.

05:43.899 --> 05:45.039
You think that he rigged

05:45.040 --> 05:46.919
that explosion in the
shed just to hurt you?

05:47.135 --> 05:48.839
I guess the police are looking for him now,

05:48.840 --> 05:50.841
but Harold's gone completely off the grid.

05:51.629 --> 05:53.219
I really hope they find him soon.

05:53.751 --> 05:56.787
- You sure it was him?
- Who else would it be?

06:01.684 --> 06:04.461
Anyway, I just thought
you guys should know.

06:10.982 --> 06:13.528
Okay, please tell me no
one else bought that.

06:13.918 --> 06:15.397
I'm just glad it's over with.

06:15.398 --> 06:17.135
Meredith thought that we did that.

06:17.169 --> 06:20.284
So Mona did us a favor.
We did not ask for it.

06:20.285 --> 06:22.021
We definitely don't owe her anything.

06:22.099 --> 06:24.300
I wouldn't call anything
that Mona does a favor.

06:25.435 --> 06:27.131
You know her better than any of us, Hanna.

06:27.580 --> 06:28.706
What do you think?

06:30.747 --> 06:32.459
I think there's more to the story.

06:39.882 --> 06:42.805
Lucas, can I talk to you for a minute?

06:44.066 --> 06:44.897
Not now, Hanna.

06:44.898 --> 06:47.492
Look, I know it was you
last night in the basement.

06:48.247 --> 06:49.320
I'm not gonna tell anyone.

06:49.321 --> 06:52.313
I just... why were you there?

06:53.470 --> 06:54.740
I was looking for something.

06:57.014 --> 06:59.325
- Listen, we shouldn't be seen together.
- By who?

07:00.876 --> 07:01.946
Who do you think?

07:03.334 --> 07:05.508
Listen, if you wanna take the chance,

07:06.207 --> 07:07.806
and believe that Mona is cured,

07:08.355 --> 07:10.643
go ahead, drink the kool-aid.

07:10.644 --> 07:12.415
No one is sipping her cuckoo juice.

07:12.416 --> 07:13.818
I've seen you talk to her.

07:13.819 --> 07:16.365
So what if I talk to her? I
know better than to trust her.

07:16.991 --> 07:18.846
Lucas, why are you so freaked out?

07:18.847 --> 07:20.432
The question is, why aren't you?

07:21.298 --> 07:22.622
Have you tried stopping her?

07:23.254 --> 07:24.212
I couldn't.

07:24.547 --> 07:26.211
What do you mean, stop her?

07:28.094 --> 07:29.215
Lucas, you didn't...

07:32.239 --> 07:34.107
You almost blew up a teacher.

07:34.108 --> 07:36.933
I just wanted to scare her. I
didn't want to hurt anybody.

07:36.934 --> 07:39.792
So get a restraining
order or a can of mace.

07:41.001 --> 07:42.582
- I should go.
- No, look.

07:43.082 --> 07:45.048
If you need help, let me help you.

07:47.117 --> 07:48.138
You can't.

07:50.644 --> 07:53.088
Just promise me you won't try
another stunt like that again.

07:54.077 --> 07:55.433
I had to do something.

07:56.421 --> 07:58.206
As long as Mona is back here,

07:58.898 --> 08:00.150
we're not safe.

08:13.366 --> 08:14.333
Paige.

08:15.625 --> 08:18.315
I have to get straight home.
Text you later?

08:19.214 --> 08:20.807
Can you walk me to work, at least?

08:24.687 --> 08:26.322
You know how it's been since Halloween.

08:27.530 --> 08:30.285
My parents are just being cautious.

08:30.842 --> 08:32.904
If I'm even a little late, I get blasted.

08:33.167 --> 08:34.267
Tell me about it.

08:34.268 --> 08:36.001
My dad almost made me quit my job.

08:36.316 --> 08:38.232
You know why he's doing that, right?

08:38.732 --> 08:40.755
- Things have happened to you.
- And to you.

08:40.938 --> 08:42.227
Yeah, I get that he wants

08:42.229 --> 08:43.756
to keep me safe because of what happened,

08:43.756 --> 08:46.583
but I wanna keep moving forward.

08:46.584 --> 08:48.928
How can you not think about
what we went through?

08:49.488 --> 08:50.644
I'll never forget.

08:51.698 --> 08:53.835
But looking back for me
ended in that lighthouse.

08:55.375 --> 08:56.848
We've both been cooped up.

08:56.849 --> 08:58.137
Some of the girls from the swim team

08:58.138 --> 08:59.369
are having a party in the woods.

08:59.370 --> 09:00.666
Don't you have a curfew?

09:00.941 --> 09:02.517
Yeah. We'll go on the early side

09:02.518 --> 09:03.842
so I can get back on time.

09:05.891 --> 09:07.856
I think it'll do both of us some good.

09:09.758 --> 09:13.130
- You in?
- Yeah, I'm in.

09:13.506 --> 09:15.741
Cool. I'll text them and let
them know we're coming.

09:15.742 --> 09:17.035
Okay.

09:27.124 --> 09:29.306
- Hey.
- Hey.

09:29.941 --> 09:31.470
They were all out of the times,

09:31.471 --> 09:33.444
but I got you lots of
copies of the observer.

09:33.618 --> 09:36.188
Thank you for helping
my freshmen to remember

09:36.189 --> 09:39.790
that TMZ is not the only
source for current events.

09:41.128 --> 09:42.262
If I think about this too much,

09:42.263 --> 09:43.294
it makes me want to run out

09:43.295 --> 09:45.139
in the middle of the street and scream.

09:45.727 --> 09:47.242
Why, 'cause of what happened to Garrett?

09:47.612 --> 09:49.900
No. That in the middle of all this,

09:49.901 --> 09:52.279
people are forgetting that
a young girl was killed.

09:52.378 --> 09:55.004
Yeah, and we still don't
know who did it or why.

09:58.008 --> 10:00.000
I've actually been thinking

10:00.032 --> 10:02.357
about what happened the
night Ali went missing.

10:02.420 --> 10:05.838
A lot. You and dad, you
went to a barbecue, right?

10:05.839 --> 10:07.251
After you dropped me off at Spencer's.

10:07.666 --> 10:10.508
Yeah, it was some stuffy Hollis thing

10:10.509 --> 10:12.893
at the chancellor's with cocktail wieners

10:12.894 --> 10:16.471
and sliders and fancy dipping sauces.

10:17.936 --> 10:19.590
You needed us that next morning,

10:19.591 --> 10:22.565
and we slept in, your father and I.

10:22.641 --> 10:27.468
I don't think we or I
ever apologized for that.

10:27.469 --> 10:29.527
Mom, it's okay.

10:29.656 --> 10:30.851
No, it's not.

10:30.887 --> 10:32.623
But it's one of those moments as a parent

10:32.624 --> 10:34.297
you wish you could do over again.

10:36.389 --> 10:39.141
We thought we had a night
off from the kids.

10:43.261 --> 10:45.122
A night off from the kids, huh?

10:46.651 --> 10:49.889
- So you were out pretty late.
- No.

10:50.148 --> 10:51.373
We left early.

10:52.013 --> 10:54.220
I snuck a bottle of wine home in my purse.

10:54.221 --> 10:55.604
I thought we'd save it,

10:55.605 --> 10:57.877
but your father opened it
as soon as we got home.

10:58.730 --> 10:59.953
We sat on the porch.

11:00.853 --> 11:02.929
It was lovely, warm.

11:02.930 --> 11:04.095
I remember.

11:05.650 --> 11:07.175
Till the storm rolled in.

11:08.391 --> 11:11.159
I'm pretty sure we were dead
to the world before that.

11:11.437 --> 11:12.834
One too many glasses of red,

11:12.835 --> 11:15.255
and I can sleep through a stampede.

11:17.091 --> 11:19.898
And we slept through your
first call that morning.

11:26.311 --> 11:28.219
It's so weird to think back to that night.

11:28.782 --> 11:30.661
You were at a party with your friends.

11:31.575 --> 11:34.285
I let Byron pour that extra glass of wine,

11:34.286 --> 11:36.482
and we were all just enjoying ourselves

11:36.483 --> 11:40.216
while something... terrible was happening.

11:46.130 --> 11:47.311
Brad's parents said he should be able

11:47.312 --> 11:48.860
to whisper in a week or so.

11:48.922 --> 11:50.892
Guess he hit his trachea on the handlebars.

11:51.441 --> 11:53.013
They figured out what happened?

11:53.014 --> 11:54.488
His front wheel fell off.

11:54.902 --> 11:57.853
- I guess there was a faulty nut.
- Wow.

11:58.222 --> 12:00.107
Should we move on to new business?

12:01.287 --> 12:02.464
First things first.

12:02.489 --> 12:03.967
We have to welcome a new member.

12:04.058 --> 12:07.233
- Mona Vanderwall will be joining us.
- Wait, what?

12:07.234 --> 12:09.745
Word came down from the faculty
advisor this afternoon.

12:09.887 --> 12:12.303
Joining in school activities
is part of her recovery.

12:13.152 --> 12:15.277
I guess she has a note from her doctor.

12:17.382 --> 12:18.684
You guys have history.

12:20.643 --> 12:21.752
That's rough.

12:22.388 --> 12:24.077
Yeah, if you're downplaying it.

12:26.006 --> 12:27.500
Hey, sorry I'm late.

12:27.706 --> 12:31.731
I had to get some signatures
and a copy of my transcripts,

12:31.732 --> 12:35.199
and... oh, and this.

12:39.418 --> 12:42.297
Okay, second item. Team Captain.

12:42.998 --> 12:46.906
Running for position, Spencer Hastings...

12:47.880 --> 12:49.772
And Mona Vanderwall.

12:57.333 --> 12:58.617
Now that's rough.

12:58.970 --> 13:00.401
Okay, why?

13:00.872 --> 13:03.286
I played dumb for a really
long time, Spencer.

13:03.864 --> 13:05.234
I'm not gonna do that anymore.

13:05.753 --> 13:07.793
This is a chance to show
people who I really am.

13:08.487 --> 13:10.862
I see. And when did you even...

13:10.863 --> 13:14.632
I kept up with my schoolwork
while I was... away,

13:15.180 --> 13:17.189
and I memorized the study guide...

13:19.115 --> 13:20.183
Last night.

13:20.950 --> 13:21.990
All right.

13:23.101 --> 13:25.418
Andrew, as secretary, you
call the vote, right?

13:25.687 --> 13:26.687
Right.

13:27.748 --> 13:30.664
All those in favor of Mona as team Captain.

13:39.632 --> 13:41.063
I had so time to campaign.

13:42.683 --> 13:43.981
And Spencer?

13:49.953 --> 13:52.948
A tie. Unbelievable.

13:53.205 --> 13:54.790
So I guess we have a quiz-off.

13:56.303 --> 13:58.861
Back of the study guide in the by-laws.

13:59.444 --> 14:01.026
You read the by-laws.

14:01.545 --> 14:02.829
Of course.

14:05.533 --> 14:06.622
Tomorrow then.

14:07.670 --> 14:08.870
Good luck.

14:11.293 --> 14:12.523
Andrew, anything else?

14:13.316 --> 14:16.020
No. Meeting adjourned.

14:16.337 --> 14:17.311
Thank you.

14:17.984 --> 14:18.943
Thank you.

14:19.710 --> 14:21.215
- Hi, I'm Mona.
- Thanks.

14:24.572 --> 14:25.468
Hey.

14:27.999 --> 14:29.230
That was out of left field.

14:29.829 --> 14:31.886
Come on. Don't tell me
you didn't enjoy that.

14:31.887 --> 14:33.249
Honestly, I didn't.

14:33.322 --> 14:35.852
Look, I know why you want
this; Yale will be impressed.

14:36.257 --> 14:37.557
But when it comes to Mona...

14:37.558 --> 14:39.027
What she wants is anyone's guess.

14:42.622 --> 14:44.198
Nobody asked Mona to play.

14:45.133 --> 14:47.480
So... put on your Hastings face

14:47.481 --> 14:49.752
and spank her tomorrow
night like I know you can.

14:51.109 --> 14:52.182
Good pep talk.

15:18.237 --> 15:20.008
Maybe her phone was hidden or something.

15:20.253 --> 15:21.492
If she's gonna dip bag into

15:21.493 --> 15:23.673
the "A" bag to scare me
off the decathlon team,

15:23.843 --> 15:25.051
she's got another think coming.

15:25.052 --> 15:27.269
Is being Captain brainiac
really that important?

15:29.783 --> 15:31.033
Do you know something we don't?

15:31.532 --> 15:33.021
No. I'm just saying,

15:33.022 --> 15:34.801
if Mona's back to her old tricks,

15:34.802 --> 15:37.257
then maybe we should stay away from her.

15:37.258 --> 15:39.542
Like sabotaging Brad so
she could run against me

15:39.543 --> 15:41.901
for team captain? That's so...

15:42.153 --> 15:42.871
...Ali.

15:50.390 --> 15:51.262
She's coming over here.

15:54.413 --> 15:55.290
Hi, Spencer.

15:56.292 --> 15:58.271
Listen, I just wanted to thank you

15:58.272 --> 15:59.734
for being such a good sport.

16:00.223 --> 16:02.381
I know that the two of us
running for the same position

16:02.382 --> 16:05.011
could have caused some tension.

16:06.510 --> 16:07.910
I didn't mean to
make a big deal of that.

16:07.911 --> 16:10.072
I would've called or texted, but...

16:10.340 --> 16:11.597
Oh, no, Mona, I got your text.

16:12.090 --> 16:13.071
Yesterday.

16:13.325 --> 16:15.694
I'm not allowed to have a cell phone.

16:16.295 --> 16:17.869
No texting, no Internet.

16:18.422 --> 16:20.145
Part of my release terms from Radley.

16:20.146 --> 16:23.200
No Internet. So how did you
post that apology video?

16:23.316 --> 16:26.459
The vice-principal said that
I could have limited access

16:26.460 --> 16:27.455
to the computer lab.

16:28.265 --> 16:30.232
Homework only, supervised.

16:30.525 --> 16:33.466
That was certainly calculating,
but I wouldn't call it trig.

16:34.244 --> 16:37.422
I thought it was the right thing
to do, so I asked Jason and...

16:37.423 --> 16:40.213
- He's helping you?
- He supervised.

16:42.111 --> 16:43.099
It was my idea.

16:43.100 --> 16:45.315
We know you were sneaking
out of Radley, Mona.

16:45.669 --> 16:47.343
How are we supposed to
believe anything you say?

16:52.266 --> 16:54.497
- Mona?
- The doctor said that

16:54.498 --> 16:56.267
people might have some trouble.

16:57.766 --> 17:00.323
It's just been a little more
overwhelming than I thought, you know,

17:00.324 --> 17:03.999
to confront the past and

17:04.409 --> 17:05.690
work it out with all of you.

17:09.550 --> 17:10.653
Can you excuse me?

17:16.329 --> 17:17.683
That was part of her act, right?

17:23.127 --> 17:24.003
Yeah, let's go.

17:42.318 --> 17:44.689
It's my week to monitor detention, so...

17:44.690 --> 17:45.712
I just need a minute.

17:47.451 --> 17:50.913
I saw you and Aria talking
yesterday after school.

17:51.833 --> 17:52.911
Looked pretty intense.

17:53.430 --> 17:55.202
Just mother-daughter stuff.

17:55.513 --> 17:57.041
I assume it was about this.

18:00.167 --> 18:02.428
I just want you to know that
I won't be pursuing things.

18:02.429 --> 18:04.977
Because the person who did
that to you was identified.

18:06.163 --> 18:07.381
I jumped to a conclusion.

18:10.907 --> 18:13.298
Aria and I haven't had the easiest time.

18:14.290 --> 18:18.021
And I hope I haven't made
things harder for us.

18:18.655 --> 18:21.417
I'm seeing someone now,
and Byron has moved on.

18:21.696 --> 18:24.127
I'm sure that we can keep
things professional.

18:24.846 --> 18:27.305
I would like that if we could.

18:28.730 --> 18:30.003
I have to monitor detention.

18:38.404 --> 18:40.151
Spencer says Jason checks out.

18:40.645 --> 18:42.231
Apparently, he was working with Mona,

18:42.232 --> 18:44.174
but just her Internet nanny.

18:44.957 --> 18:46.740
Great. We still don't
know who's helping Mona.

18:47.834 --> 18:49.169
I talked to my mom yesterday.

18:49.413 --> 18:50.600
You look a little green.

18:50.601 --> 18:52.260
Yeah, I've been feeling queasy.

18:52.261 --> 18:55.448
I think the stress is just getting to me.

18:56.033 --> 18:56.805
What did she say?

18:56.806 --> 18:59.418
As far as my mom knows, my dad
was with her the whole night.

18:59.970 --> 19:01.122
But she slept through that storm.

19:01.123 --> 19:03.309
She could've easily slept through
him sneaking out of the house.

19:03.570 --> 19:05.763
He knows how she gets after a
couple of glasses of wine.

19:07.778 --> 19:09.640
I just don't wanna believe
that it was intentional.

19:09.641 --> 19:12.178
So you're saying he wanted her
to sleep through the night?

19:13.347 --> 19:15.519
But it still doesn't mean that
he snuck out to meet Alison.

19:16.362 --> 19:17.691
Maybe he met up with Meredith.

19:17.692 --> 19:18.739
Were they still together then?

19:18.740 --> 19:19.932
No, they weren't seeing each other.

19:21.413 --> 19:22.335
That's what he told me.

19:22.856 --> 19:25.171
In the journal entry, he said
he promised to meet Alison

19:25.172 --> 19:26.628
when she came back from her grandmother's.

19:26.900 --> 19:28.009
At was the same night she died.

19:28.010 --> 19:30.273
Maybe he agreed to meet
her at a different time.

19:30.547 --> 19:32.471
No, he didn't. It said that...

19:32.472 --> 19:33.302
I'll show you.

19:40.218 --> 19:41.311
Guys, the pages aren't in here.

19:43.380 --> 19:45.338
- Check the other boot.
- No, I put it in the left one.

19:45.339 --> 19:46.939
- You're sure it's this one?
- Yes.

19:53.805 --> 19:55.155
That's quite a mess you're making.

19:57.565 --> 19:58.236
Did you lose something?

19:58.237 --> 20:00.084
No. Yeah.

20:00.085 --> 20:01.935
We're just looking for
the other one of these.

20:03.188 --> 20:04.753
Oh, here it is.

20:05.362 --> 20:06.090
Crisis averted.

20:06.668 --> 20:09.374
Um, I thought that you
had a meeting tonight.

20:09.375 --> 20:11.622
I canceled it. I have to
pack for a conference.

20:11.623 --> 20:13.413
I have a colleague who had an emergency.

20:13.990 --> 20:16.958
- I'm filling in.
- Okay.

20:18.046 --> 20:20.917
Remember when Mike used to
raid your Halloween candy?

20:21.509 --> 20:23.449
You always used to stash
it in your snow boots.

20:24.261 --> 20:25.459
He never thought to look there.

20:26.418 --> 20:27.978
I always thought that was pretty clever.

20:31.606 --> 20:34.446
Well, I'll get out of your hair.

20:42.327 --> 20:43.234
He knows.

20:46.026 --> 20:49.529
Tajikistan to ***, Ukraine, and
Uzbekistan.

20:50.809 --> 20:53.125
Alphabetical order, you are good..

20:53.191 --> 20:54.659
Okay, toss me some hard stuff.

20:54.660 --> 20:56.508
We haven't touched anything
from earth sciences.

20:56.768 --> 20:57.735
I made these flash cards

20:57.736 --> 20:59.417
for the periodic tables
that I wanna go over.

20:59.418 --> 21:00.351
Have you seen those?

21:00.352 --> 21:02.963
I can come with you, and
I can rub your shoulders

21:02.964 --> 21:05.204
between rounds, and wrap your knuckles,

21:05.205 --> 21:06.684
and hold your spit bucket.

21:06.685 --> 21:08.689
This is not a prize fight,

21:08.690 --> 21:11.327
- but I would like to punch her.
- Spencer...

21:11.847 --> 21:13.467
No, I would love for you to be there,

21:13.468 --> 21:16.367
- but don't you have dinner with your boss?
- I can cancel.

21:16.368 --> 21:18.562
I've got this, and thanks to you,

21:18.563 --> 21:20.130
I'm gonna wipe the floor with her.

21:21.469 --> 21:23.778
You know, this isn't about looking good

21:23.779 --> 21:25.491
on college applications anymore.

21:27.373 --> 21:29.500
There are 42 clubs at rosewood high.

21:30.071 --> 21:31.978
Mona could've picked any one of them.

21:32.819 --> 21:33.825
She's baiting me.

21:34.704 --> 21:36.550
And the only way to stop
her is to beat her,

21:36.551 --> 21:37.428
fair and square.

21:38.248 --> 21:39.592
I don't have time for flash cards anymore.

21:39.854 --> 21:41.662
I have to get changed, and
you're gonna be late for dinner.

21:45.074 --> 21:46.853
- My boss.
- Okay.

21:47.488 --> 21:50.477
Hey. Sure, no problem.

21:50.478 --> 21:51.860
I'll stop on the way.

21:52.426 --> 21:53.750
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

21:57.601 --> 21:59.055
Yeah, I'm just leaving right now.

22:08.492 --> 22:10.321
Hey, your mom let me up.

22:11.380 --> 22:12.516
Can I talk to you for a minute?

22:21.929 --> 22:23.108
Look, um...

22:24.197 --> 22:25.911
I know you warned me about Mona,

22:26.753 --> 22:29.010
but we kind of poked the bear today,

22:29.011 --> 22:31.952
and I just wanna make sure she
didn't take it out on you.

22:32.479 --> 22:34.266
Mona's not my problem anymore.

22:35.449 --> 22:38.440
I'm leaving rosewood high for good.

22:39.120 --> 22:41.648
She can't get to me if I'm home-schooled.

22:42.008 --> 22:43.592
So she was blackmailing you.

22:52.067 --> 22:53.520
Try still blackmailing.

22:54.595 --> 22:55.439
For how long?

22:55.440 --> 22:58.815
Since the masquerade ball.
I got an anonymous text

22:58.816 --> 23:00.000
to go to go distract Jenna.

23:00.562 --> 23:01.848
And then, after that,

23:02.102 --> 23:04.501
when she was in Radley,
she got a contact again.

23:07.615 --> 23:10.284
I picked up an envelope
from Jason DiLaurentis.

23:10.821 --> 23:11.999
And brought it to her.

23:12.868 --> 23:14.592
Then when I told her that I was out,

23:15.142 --> 23:16.610
that I was done,

23:18.280 --> 23:19.645
she tried to run me over.

23:19.942 --> 23:21.210
Oh, my God.

23:22.168 --> 23:23.235
Lucas, are you okay?

23:24.935 --> 23:27.393
This S.U.V. just swerved
at me out of nowhere.

23:28.482 --> 23:31.005
I didn't see the driver,
but it had to be Mona.

23:31.899 --> 23:34.271
So when you were doing things for her,

23:34.272 --> 23:36.697
did you ever meet with anyone else?

23:36.698 --> 23:38.667
As far as I could tell, I
was just the middleman.

23:39.551 --> 23:41.173
She's completely protected.

23:41.762 --> 23:43.503
It's just easier if I bow out of school.

23:43.504 --> 23:45.370
Maybe that way, I can protect myself.

23:45.971 --> 23:47.856
Why would you want to protect
yourself from school?

23:47.857 --> 23:49.074
What does she have on you?

23:50.595 --> 23:52.136
Test answers,

23:53.449 --> 23:55.436
to every course the school offers.

23:57.764 --> 23:58.737
I was selling them.

23:59.045 --> 23:59.848
To who?

24:02.153 --> 24:03.358
Anyone with cash.

24:04.179 --> 24:05.524
After she tried to make me road kill,

24:05.525 --> 24:07.818
I shut everything down
and covered my tracks.

24:09.274 --> 24:10.782
Now I just have to disappear.

24:33.286 --> 24:35.619
Why don't you tell me what
you were doing in her room?

24:35.938 --> 24:37.653
I don't know why you just won't tell me.

24:37.654 --> 24:40.931
Why would you question? It's
my house, it's my daughter

24:41.823 --> 24:43.543
you're gonna walk away
in the middle of this?

24:43.815 --> 24:45.584
I can't even look at you right now.

24:45.585 --> 24:49.282
Meredith, listen. Listen. I will
not let you run away from me.

24:49.283 --> 24:50.663
Byron, my arm.

24:52.518 --> 24:54.066
Look, I didn't mn... dad?

24:56.412 --> 24:57.090
What's going on?

25:01.592 --> 25:02.933
Everything's fine, Aria.

25:19.842 --> 25:20.695
Are we even close?

25:21.217 --> 25:22.610
What does it say on the G.P.S.?

25:23.643 --> 25:26.312
A few more Miles, then
we're gonna make a left.

25:27.419 --> 25:28.688
That's really far out of town.

25:30.605 --> 25:32.241
Paige, are you okay?

25:32.736 --> 25:34.104
I just need to pull over for a sec.

25:40.865 --> 25:41.690
Paige.

25:42.563 --> 25:44.131
- Are you okay?
- I couldn't breathe.

25:44.926 --> 25:45.836
- Hey...
- Don't.

25:46.405 --> 25:49.255
I'm sorry. I just can't go, okay?

25:50.058 --> 25:52.118
Hey, that's fine. It's just a party.

25:52.119 --> 25:53.196
It's not just a party!

25:54.530 --> 25:56.932
I can't do anything since Halloween.

25:58.353 --> 25:59.546
I've been able to hide from you

25:59.547 --> 26:01.091
because your parents are protective.

26:02.141 --> 26:04.623
I told you I had a restriction, too.
I don't.

26:05.469 --> 26:07.325
I can barely leave my
house to go to school.

26:07.865 --> 26:09.630
Why didn't you tell me any of this?

26:10.648 --> 26:12.050
Because I didn't want you to know.

26:13.205 --> 26:14.681
You like strong women, right?

26:16.546 --> 26:19.912
After Nate was gone, I thought
everything would be okay again.

26:21.072 --> 26:22.997
And then, Garrett died.

26:23.918 --> 26:26.051
And now, all I can think about

26:26.052 --> 26:28.431
is when the next bad thing is gonna happen.

26:28.432 --> 26:29.707
I know you're scared.

26:30.866 --> 26:32.064
I'm scared.

26:34.412 --> 26:36.357
And now, I've ruined your night.

26:36.439 --> 26:38.731
No, you haven't ruined anything.

26:43.565 --> 26:45.105
Why don't we go for a little walk.

26:45.106 --> 26:47.409
Okay? Get some air. Okay?

27:03.118 --> 27:05.912
What kind of person... oh, hey.

27:07.168 --> 27:10.273
I bought a "get well soon" card for Brad.
Did you wanna sign?

27:10.581 --> 27:12.762
The whole team already
sent him flowers, so...

27:12.763 --> 27:15.815
I know, but there's no such
thing as too much encouragement

27:15.816 --> 27:16.684
when you're on the mend.

27:26.691 --> 27:29.751
Three rounds. Most correct answers wins.

27:30.139 --> 27:32.327
You've got ten seconds
after you ring the bell.

27:33.251 --> 27:34.367
I'll read the questions.

27:34.368 --> 27:36.493
Sam and Conrad will keep time and score.

27:37.411 --> 27:38.123
We good?

27:40.835 --> 27:41.732
Let's do this.

27:45.068 --> 27:48.509
Alexander Hamilton emigrated
to the United States

27:48.510 --> 27:51.829
in 1772 from what Caribbean island?

27:52.516 --> 27:53.356
Nevis.

27:53.931 --> 27:54.944
St. Croix.

27:55.275 --> 27:58.074
Mona's got the quick draw,
but one goes to Spencer.

27:58.392 --> 28:01.867
Next question. Luciferin
and luciferase are present

28:01.868 --> 28:03.822
in what biological phenomenon?

28:04.711 --> 28:05.701
Bioluminescence.

28:07.223 --> 28:08.221
Next question.

28:28.840 --> 28:29.912
I followed you.

28:32.102 --> 28:33.862
You were really upset, and my da...

28:34.587 --> 28:37.275
my dad, I have never seen
him that angry before.

28:39.305 --> 28:41.421
Is there something going on,
something that I should know about?

28:42.775 --> 28:43.915
You can sit down, you know.

28:48.569 --> 28:50.597
- Did you hear?
- Some of it.

28:51.594 --> 28:53.894
It sounded like you
caught my dad in my room.

28:54.151 --> 28:55.660
Do you know what he was doing?

28:56.607 --> 28:58.173
Rifling through papers.

29:01.124 --> 29:02.853
That wasn't the first time I caught him.

29:03.971 --> 29:05.817
He was going through my purse yesterday.

29:05.818 --> 29:08.873
What? Did he say why?

29:08.874 --> 29:11.546
He thought it was yours. When I
came across him in your room,

29:11.547 --> 29:12.949
I asked him what was going on.

29:14.141 --> 29:15.180
He wouldn't tell me.

29:16.360 --> 29:18.839
He seemed... caught.

29:19.833 --> 29:20.757
Defensive.

29:22.099 --> 29:24.774
I couldn't shake the
feeling that he was lying.

29:26.738 --> 29:30.375
So later, he went to drop
Mike off at a friend's.

29:32.632 --> 29:34.131
And I went on my own search.

29:35.229 --> 29:37.923
I found these...

29:39.103 --> 29:40.182
In his dresser.

29:40.183 --> 29:44.057
Those are mine. Did you read this?

29:48.079 --> 29:50.058
Do you know what these mean?

29:51.017 --> 29:52.438
I knew what was going on back en.

29:53.363 --> 29:55.783
Your friend Alison, blackmail.

29:55.784 --> 29:57.642
That doesn't make sense.
You weren't together then.

29:57.936 --> 30:00.399
Aria, he came to see me...

30:01.880 --> 30:04.025
The night she disappeared.

30:04.026 --> 30:06.174
He was with my mother the entire night.

30:06.175 --> 30:07.632
Did he tell you that?

30:10.340 --> 30:11.917
Why would he come to you?

30:12.924 --> 30:14.726
He thought I had something to do with it.

30:15.366 --> 30:17.310
He still believed I destroyed his office,

30:17.311 --> 30:19.448
and figured somehow, I was...

30:20.161 --> 30:22.356
Pushing her to ask for more money.

30:23.574 --> 30:25.344
Was he with you the entire night?

30:25.345 --> 30:28.244
He left my apartment to go meet her.

30:30.411 --> 30:32.052
I tried to change his mind.

30:32.329 --> 30:33.538
I begged him.

30:37.062 --> 30:38.728
The next day, she was missing.

30:44.432 --> 30:47.144
I'm pretty sure it's
the maxilla and mandible.

30:47.645 --> 30:50.258
Operation petticoat. No, wait...

30:50.259 --> 30:52.958
Operation Pegasus, The Battle of Khe Sanh.

30:53.577 --> 30:55.718
Catherine of... Aragon?

30:55.858 --> 30:57.148
Catherine of Braganza.

30:59.752 --> 31:01.096
Charles Henry and...

31:01.097 --> 31:02.830
The amish, the mennonites and...

31:02.831 --> 31:04.535
"A lesson in vengeance," by Sylvia plath.

31:04.536 --> 31:05.890
Plate tectonics.

31:06.541 --> 31:08.045
A picaresque novel.

31:08.046 --> 31:10.538
I think she meant a bildungsroman.

31:11.874 --> 31:13.634
The first territorial legislature...

31:13.635 --> 31:16.467
The rosetta stone established
the divine cult o...

31:16.468 --> 31:18.086
Pericles, beowulf and...

31:18.201 --> 31:23.077
Three noble gases? Helium, argon and xenon.

31:24.819 --> 31:28.249
I'm sorry. I know you really wanted
to go to that party tonight.

31:28.250 --> 31:32.552
No, it's fine. We'll stop and get
frozen yogurt on the way home.

31:32.802 --> 31:34.947
Anywhere with lights and people.

31:35.368 --> 31:36.905
And you, of course.

31:38.726 --> 31:39.950
Your car is funny.

31:41.348 --> 31:43.238
Great. A flat.

31:45.374 --> 31:46.878
There's a light in the glove box.

31:49.231 --> 31:50.866
Figures something like this would happen.

31:58.671 --> 32:00.138
Can I get a little light down here?

32:01.571 --> 32:02.540
Little to the left, please.

32:02.541 --> 32:04.937
Paige, just breathe. Let me help you, okay?

32:09.801 --> 32:11.150
Somebody slashed it.

32:15.981 --> 32:19.174
Okay, can we, like, walk or
jog or sprint back to town?

32:26.124 --> 32:27.572
Em, where are you going?

32:46.197 --> 32:47.356
I think we lost him.

32:47.357 --> 32:49.011
No, I swear I had him.

32:49.881 --> 32:51.917
Let's get back to town, please.

32:53.185 --> 32:53.958
Come on.

32:54.519 --> 32:55.675
Let's go home.

33:04.194 --> 33:05.415
Five seconds, Mona.

33:06.311 --> 33:11.318
Four, three, two, one.

33:11.484 --> 33:12.976
The hanseatic league.

33:13.303 --> 33:14.727
That's what we were looking for.

33:15.693 --> 33:18.892
End of round two, Spencer's
up by three points.

33:19.480 --> 33:20.594
Why don't we break?

33:25.759 --> 33:27.297
I'm good to keep going.

33:29.183 --> 33:34.233
- Mona?
- Yep. I guess so.

33:34.886 --> 33:38.014
Are you sure? I think
she could use a break.

33:38.015 --> 33:40.641
She's fine. Just ask the questions.

33:40.945 --> 33:41.677
Yep.

33:43.963 --> 33:46.198
Here we go. Round three.

33:46.514 --> 33:49.297
The house of Habsburg,
the house of Burgundy,

33:49.298 --> 33:51.181
the crowns of Castile and Aragon.

33:51.969 --> 33:53.703
Spencer, right again.

33:54.209 --> 33:55.027
Oh...

33:55.425 --> 33:57.359
The ogallala aquifer.

33:59.395 --> 34:02.338
Madame C.J. Walker in 1910.

34:07.703 --> 34:10.643
Spencer, you have ten seconds
to begin your answer.

34:11.101 --> 34:12.431
Get it right, and you win.

34:12.433 --> 34:13.192
Too easy.

34:14.077 --> 34:16.257
Fifteen countries that became independent

34:16.257 --> 34:18.656
with the dissolution of the Soviet union,

34:19.851 --> 34:21.344
in alphabetical order.

34:26.065 --> 34:28.315
Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus,

34:28.315 --> 34:29.589
Estonia...

34:34.208 --> 34:35.085
Spencer.

34:35.087 --> 34:37.687
Yeah, sorry. Just one second.

34:38.706 --> 34:39.902
Uh, Georgia.

34:40.454 --> 34:41.774
Uh, Kurdistan... sorry.

34:41.775 --> 34:44.375
Kazakhstan, then Kurdistan.

34:44.478 --> 34:46.090
Um, Lithuania.

34:46.091 --> 34:47.491
You forgot Latvia.

34:51.079 --> 34:54.001
- Russia.
- You forgot Moldova.

34:54.002 --> 34:55.510
Spencer, that's time.

34:59.280 --> 35:01.066
Let's see, what's left?

35:02.645 --> 35:06.894
Tajikistan, Turkmenistan,
Ukraine, and Uzbekistan.

35:07.777 --> 35:09.084
Mona, if you want the win,

35:09.134 --> 35:11.273
I need to hear the entire
correct answer from you.

35:13.154 --> 35:15.846
By population or gross domestic product?

35:25.554 --> 35:26.855
Aria, is that you?

35:32.384 --> 35:33.910
I'm glad you came back.

35:34.957 --> 35:36.715
I just need to get a few things.

35:36.723 --> 35:38.157
I'd like to talk.

35:43.050 --> 35:43.835
Okay.

35:48.588 --> 35:52.207
Listen, about earlier, I'm sorry.

35:52.208 --> 35:53.885
I didn't mean to scare you.

36:11.304 --> 36:12.282
Tough loss.

36:14.005 --> 36:15.537
We can still shut this down.

36:16.024 --> 36:19.116
Go to the faculty advisor,
plead special circumstances.

36:20.282 --> 36:22.419
After everything, they'll
have to hear you out.

36:23.941 --> 36:25.569
Would you wanna win that way?

36:31.851 --> 36:34.737
Hey, I just got your text. You okay?

36:34.941 --> 36:37.362
Um, I lost.

36:39.359 --> 36:40.662
Did she cheat?

36:41.156 --> 36:41.963
Yeah.

36:42.957 --> 36:44.187
I don't know.

36:44.188 --> 36:48.669
Um, I just really blew it, and
I need to get outta here.

36:48.961 --> 36:50.082
Toby's not home?

36:50.374 --> 36:53.745
No, he's still out at dinner with his boss.

36:54.233 --> 36:55.776
Okay, we'll go.

36:55.777 --> 36:56.973
Okay. Thank you.

36:57.903 --> 36:59.337
In one second.

37:00.376 --> 37:02.591
- What are you doing?
- Just hang on.

37:02.919 --> 37:04.732
Mona, can I talk to you for a minute?

37:04.733 --> 37:07.775
Sure. Oh, there's still more
cupcakes if you wanna join.

37:07.776 --> 37:08.874
I'm on to you.

37:09.871 --> 37:11.640
Okay, nothing's changed.

37:11.641 --> 37:14.366
You are still pulling strings
and pushing buttons.

37:14.367 --> 37:17.863
Manipulating lives, using people's secrets.

37:18.154 --> 37:20.706
I wasted months visiting you,

37:20.707 --> 37:24.044
defending you, feeling guilty
for everything you did to me.

37:24.045 --> 37:27.062
And I kept thinking, maybe
if I was a better friend.

37:27.063 --> 37:29.007
You almost reeled me in.

37:30.039 --> 37:32.755
"I'm scared, Hanna. I need you." Bull crap.

37:32.756 --> 37:35.036
I know you're still "a," and I
know what you're doing to Lucas.

37:35.037 --> 37:36.792
Whatever Lucas said... - no, I'm done.

37:37.191 --> 37:39.861
I don't wanna see you, I
don't wanna hear from you,

37:40.014 --> 37:41.373
and I don't wanna know you.

37:44.009 --> 37:45.735
I'm sorry you feel that way.

37:56.316 --> 37:58.590
We have a competition in, like, a month.

37:59.022 --> 38:00.583
Overnight travel.

38:00.584 --> 38:03.308
I'm not gonna be able to
survive a weekend with Mona.

38:03.514 --> 38:06.705
Maybe we should throw her
under a bus, literally.

38:07.041 --> 38:08.242
Here's more ice.

38:09.716 --> 38:10.813
This isn't working.

38:11.058 --> 38:13.081
I'd actually need to remove my brain,

38:13.082 --> 38:15.335
and soak it in an ice bath....

38:21.039 --> 38:23.312
"cut Mona off? Big mistake.

38:23.550 --> 38:26.714
You're not the only one who
can slice and dice. A."

38:27.789 --> 38:30.742
It's not Lucas? - 100% not Lucas.

38:30.743 --> 38:34.327
Mona just used him like an
evil personal assistant.

38:34.982 --> 38:37.765
I think there's more people
out there who are way worse.

38:37.766 --> 38:39.431
You shouldn't have yelled at her like that.

38:39.432 --> 38:40.710
Spence, she had it coming.

38:40.711 --> 38:42.350
I know, but if she's up to her old tricks,

38:42.351 --> 38:43.987
that text won't be the end of it.

38:43.988 --> 38:46.267
So what? We know her tricks.

38:46.868 --> 38:49.218
I'm not gonna live my life in fear.

38:49.709 --> 38:51.467
Mona can't hide from us anymore.

38:51.468 --> 38:54.190
Do you remember when she started
to unravel the other day

38:54.191 --> 38:55.179
in the courtyard?

38:55.180 --> 38:57.438
I saw her crack like that tonight.

38:58.160 --> 39:00.785
I thought I could rattle her
cage and send her running.

39:00.786 --> 39:02.221
That's what made me lose.

39:02.222 --> 39:04.150
- How?
- 'Cause I got cocky,

39:04.151 --> 39:05.455
and competitive.

39:05.534 --> 39:08.270
I saw this soft underbelly, and I lunged.

39:08.271 --> 39:10.947
So you think she showed you
a weak spot on purpose?

39:10.948 --> 39:12.363
That's what I'm worried about.

39:12.880 --> 39:15.138
She doesn't have to hide
behind "A" anymore.

39:15.652 --> 39:17.619
She can take us on right in the open.

39:24.497 --> 39:26.162
Did your parents say it was okay?

39:27.114 --> 39:30.606
I told them I was sleeping
downstairs on the couch.

39:30.607 --> 39:32.987
My dad's gonna call the
auto club in the morning.

39:34.149 --> 39:37.319
Maybe by then, we'll have an excuse
for why the tire was slashed.

39:40.145 --> 39:41.762
I feel like this is all my fault.

39:42.717 --> 39:44.297
I told you about "a."

39:44.399 --> 39:46.417
It makes sense that you're
worried all the time.

39:47.012 --> 39:47.868
Panicked.

39:49.912 --> 39:52.206
Em, I don't blame you.

39:52.706 --> 39:54.716
I just wonder how you can do it.

39:55.588 --> 39:57.928
You chased somebody through
the woods tonight.

39:58.152 --> 40:01.238
You refuse to be scared, even
after everything that's happened.

40:01.239 --> 40:02.866
I still get scared.

40:04.039 --> 40:05.892
Mostly, I get angry.

40:06.589 --> 40:08.843
I don't deserve to live like this.

40:08.844 --> 40:09.809
Neither do you.

40:14.057 --> 40:15.859
- I'm sorry.
- Don't be.

40:15.959 --> 40:17.727
I feel safer with you here.

40:19.142 --> 40:23.286
Paige, I think that maybe
you should see somebody.

40:24.240 --> 40:27.628
Just promise me you'll
at least think about it.

40:29.882 --> 40:30.671
Promise.

40:31.955 --> 40:33.509
Okay. Get some sleep.

40:54.732 --> 40:55.599
Where is he?

40:55.882 --> 40:57.897
Your father went to campus
for a little while.

40:57.898 --> 40:59.836
He had some work to get done.

41:00.680 --> 41:01.961
Feeling any better?

41:02.509 --> 41:05.654
No. Um, I thought it was
all the stuff with my dad

41:05.655 --> 41:06.892
that was tying me up in knots.

41:06.893 --> 41:09.446
Now I think I have the actual flu. Yay.

41:11.700 --> 41:14.915
It's my powerhouse potion. All herbal.

41:14.916 --> 41:17.566
I make a big pot at the
first sign of anything.

41:17.895 --> 41:19.516
Trust me, it works wonders.

41:22.264 --> 41:25.220
I don't think Byron knows
we have those pages.

41:25.653 --> 41:27.403
So if you want, I can take them...

41:27.404 --> 41:29.273
no, don't worry. I hid them.

41:33.518 --> 41:36.022
Is there any way this was
some horrible accident?

41:37.035 --> 41:40.016
Your father would never
intentionally hurt that girl...

41:40.691 --> 41:41.347
Would he?

41:47.491 --> 41:49.162
Well, he'll be gone for a few days,

41:49.163 --> 41:51.052
so that gives us time to figure it out.

41:51.053 --> 41:54.262
Meredith, he's my dad, and
I obviously love him,

41:54.263 --> 41:56.363
but you don't think that we should
keep this a secret, do you?

41:56.364 --> 41:58.080
We both love Byron.

41:58.594 --> 42:01.326
Whatever happens next,
it's gonna be tough, Aria.

42:03.275 --> 42:04.224
Get some sleep.

42:07.703 --> 42:08.811
Meredith.

42:10.413 --> 42:11.290
Thanks.

42:13.367 --> 42:14.374
For the tea.

42:54.538 --> 42:57.409
He's leaving. I'll call you back.

43:25.166 --> 43:30.166
