that prints, dental, and DNA
were not in the system.Nope.

10:33.284 --> 10:35.243
But the cash he had on him was.

10:35.286 --> 10:36.723
Jim was right.Cash they found

10:36.766 --> 10:37.985
was part of a ransom

10:38.028 --> 10:39.726
paid to the man
they knew as Lucky.

10:39.769 --> 10:41.684
So this is who
you're looking for.

10:41.728 --> 10:43.686
Sketch artist worked that up
back in '96

10:43.730 --> 10:45.296
with a neighbor
of the last woman taken.

10:45.340 --> 10:46.907
They only got a glimpse,

10:46.950 --> 10:48.604
and no one's seen either since.

10:48.648 --> 10:50.214
Kelsey Webb, 24.

Taken August 20, 1996.

10:53.000 --> 10:54.697
Whoa.

10:54.741 --> 10:56.786

Check the carotid.

11:47.097 --> 11:48.882
Whoever killed this poor girl--

11:48.925 --> 11:50.448
they didn't do it
by cutting her head off.

11:50.492 --> 11:52.668
Must have removed it
just for us.

11:52.712 --> 11:53.930
The severed edge is smooth.

11:53.974 --> 11:55.802
If cause was decapitation,
the tunica externa

11:55.845 --> 11:56.890
would be shriveled by now.

11:56.933 --> 11:58.065
We get a nice look

11:58.108 --> 11:59.414
because she was buried
in quicklime.

Well. Then, please.
Do the honors.

RAJAN:
She has a long incisor.

12:23.307 --> 12:25.440
You don't need to wait for DNA.

I'll inform the parents
their daughter's been found.

SIDLE:
She had a nicer smile
than Lucky did.

12:33.840 --> 12:35.363
Brass is gonna be torn up.

12:35.406 --> 12:37.408
He still blames himself.Why?

12:37.452 --> 12:39.541
Lucky got paid huge ransoms

12:39.584 --> 12:41.021
to return his first three
abductees.

12:41.064 --> 12:42.718
So Brass pitched a sting
for the fourth.

12:42.762 --> 12:45.242
Lucky sniffed it out
and disappeared.

12:45.286 --> 12:47.418
Maybe that's
why he blames Brass.

12:47.462 --> 12:49.203
Cost him a couple million bucks.

12:49.246 --> 12:51.118
People kill for less.
But his note

12:51.161 --> 12:53.729
said, "Brass is just
the beginning."

12:53.773 --> 12:55.731
And I don't know
what he's planning,

12:55.775 --> 12:58.081

and decided to switch sports.

12:58.125 --> 13:00.083
Max, if it's all right with
you, I'm gonna learn more

Brass's buddy with the knife--

13:01.911 --> 13:03.957
work backwards from there.And I'll help you,

13:04.000 --> 13:06.960
but first we need to examine
the attacker's clothes.

13:07.612 --> 13:09.484
Well, you know
what else might help?

13:09.527 --> 13:10.615
He also dropped the head.

13:10.659 --> 13:11.878
The flesh is...

13:11.921 --> 13:13.401
well, it's smushed.

13:13.444 --> 13:15.795
Somewhere between decapitation
and the box,

13:15.838 --> 13:18.145
this head impacted a surface
that was coated in...

13:18.188 --> 13:20.495

13:20.538 --> 13:21.626

Brass made such a mess.

SIDLE:
You know,

14:54.719 --> 14:56.286

would have been

14:56.330 --> 14:58.027
really impressed
with this coronal sectioning.

14:58.071 --> 15:01.030
So this is the brain
of Brass's attacker?

15:02.423 --> 15:03.467
Call me Hugo.

15:04.251 --> 15:06.166
Dr. Robbins trained me,
actually.

15:06.209 --> 15:09.082

still watching me when I cut.

15:09.125 --> 15:10.997
You know he's retired,
not dead?

15:11.040 --> 15:14.261

the corpus callosum? Motive?

15:17.351 --> 15:19.701
Some reason this guy
would become a killer?

15:19.744 --> 15:20.832
In a way, yes.

15:20.876 --> 15:22.573
Well, th-there is
a lot of plaque.

15:22.617 --> 15:24.401
During the autopsy,

15:24.445 --> 15:25.707
I noticed cirrhosis in the liver

15:25.750 --> 15:27.404
and auricular hematoma,
of course.

No, no, by all means.

melted pieces at least, right?

18:37.638 --> 18:41.381

themselves and burned the scene?

18:41.424 --> 18:43.296

So, this will be the pawnshop

19:14.544 --> 19:17.286

19:17.330 --> 19:20.333
Wow. Poor kid took it

19:20.376 --> 19:21.595
Yeah.

19:21.638 --> 19:24.728
Killer steps up
to the counter here

19:24.772 --> 19:26.121
and bang.

19:26.165 --> 19:29.211
Best guess based off
the exit wound is a .22,

19:29.255 --> 19:31.126
but it's just a guess.

19:31.170 --> 19:32.693
SIDLE:
So, all these melted guns...

19:32.736 --> 19:35.130
this was the killer cleaning up
after themselves?

19:35.174 --> 19:36.958

Maybe. I haven't been
able to find

19:37.001 --> 19:38.177

take them.

19:39.482 --> 19:41.180

probably double

19:41.223 --> 19:42.529
what we think was taken
in electronics,

19:42.572 --> 19:44.444
jewelry and guitars.So, was this a robbery,

19:44.487 --> 19:45.967

I worked the case
with Detective Brass in 2010.

31:14.263 --> 31:15.961
One of our lab techs--
David Hodges--

31:16.004 --> 31:18.311

So there's motive.ROBY:
There's more than that.

31:20.356 --> 31:22.924
We pulled prison files
on all of Lucky's cellmates,

31:22.968 --> 31:25.013
looking for someone he might
have told about his stash.

31:25.057 --> 31:27.842
Dwyer's the only one
with the same phenotype

31:27.886 --> 31:29.931

who handled that old cash.

31:29.975 --> 31:32.455

31:32.499 --> 31:33.935

he's supposed to live

31:33.979 --> 31:35.415

during probation.

31:35.458 --> 31:37.112

seen him in over a month.

Kelsey Webb's body...

31:45.120 --> 31:46.556
Just pray Officer Fisher's

31:46.600 --> 31:47.906

was when he killed Danny.

32:03.660 --> 32:05.010
You saw the hole in the skull.

32:05.053 --> 32:07.099
That look like
a bullet entry wound to you?

32:07.142 --> 32:08.665
We thought the killer shot Danny
face-to-face,

32:08.709 --> 32:10.015
that the bullet went in
through the eye

32:10.058 --> 32:11.320
and exited through the back
of the head.

32:14.410 --> 32:16.021
But that's not the only
possible explanation

32:16.064 --> 32:17.979
for the hole in
the occipital bone.

32:18.023 --> 32:22.244
A tipless wooden bolt would make
a jagged entry wound...

32:25.900 --> 32:27.684
...and it wouldn't come out
the other side at all.

32:27.728 --> 32:29.469
You're talking about an arrow?

32:29.512 --> 32:31.993
That's why we didn't find
any bullets or shell casings.

32:32.037 --> 32:34.909
The killer didn't collect them.
There weren't any.

32:34.953 --> 32:37.085

He left it there
because it can't prove anything.

40:59.195 --> 41:00.240
He knows forensics.

41:00.283 --> 41:02.242
He knows how we work.

41:02.285 --> 41:03.548
He knows what he's doing.

41:03.591 --> 41:04.853
Well, then we'd better find him,

41:04.897 --> 41:06.464
or else your friend's
in real trouble.

41:06.507 --> 41:08.378
Okay, listen to me.
We can't make this

41:08.422 --> 41:09.771
all about David Hodges.

41:09.815 --> 41:10.903
What happened here,
whatever happened here,

41:10.946 --> 41:12.339
how we handle it

41:12.382 --> 41:15.603
will determine whether
convictions hold up or not.

41:15.647 --> 41:18.040
Whether murderers stay
in prison or not.

41:19.912 --> 41:22.915
Whether they're out there
killing again...

41:22.958 --> 41:24.786
or not.

41:26.614 --> 41:28.398
First lawsuit got filed.

41:28.442 --> 41:30.313
Only took three days.

41:30.357 --> 41:32.620
And there's more coming.

41:32.664 --> 41:35.449
A class action, Max thinks.

41:35.493 --> 41:36.972
All the cases
in the storage unit?

41:37.016 --> 41:38.626
No. Every case.

41:38.670 --> 41:42.021
Every defendant that was put
away with evidence from our lab

41:42.064 --> 41:44.458
the entire time
that David Hodges was at CSI.

41:44.502 --> 41:46.025
That's insane.
There could be hundreds.

41:46.068 --> 41:48.506
Thousands,
and there's precedent.

41:48.549 --> 41:50.116
That lab tech in Boston,

41:50.159 --> 41:51.944
there was a scandal
in Houston, too.

41:51.987 --> 41:54.512
Max has held off the
D.A. this long, but...

41:54.555 --> 41:57.079
they're gonna charge Hodges.
They have to.

41:58.733 --> 42:01.431
We're not gonna let him
take this fall.

42:01.475 --> 42:04.304
That's a nice thing to say.

42:04.347 --> 42:06.045
But what's the plan?

42:06.088 --> 42:08.961
You didn't come all the way to
Vegas to sit on the sidelines.

42:09.004 --> 42:10.658
What do we do now?

42:12.486 --> 42:14.923
What we always do, Jim.

42:14.967 --> 42:16.185
Follow the evidence.

42:31.549 --> 42:33.551
