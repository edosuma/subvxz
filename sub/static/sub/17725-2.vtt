00:01.148 --> 00:03.183
Oh! I'm so exhausted.

00:03.217 --> 00:04.316
Today on the treadmill,

00:04.351 --> 00:07.286
I actually fell asleep
for a quarter mile.

00:07.320 --> 00:09.355
You were talking in your
sleep again last night.

00:09.389 --> 00:12.758
Yeah, it's these new meds.
Why can't they have cool side effects?

00:12.792 --> 00:15.827
- What would be a cool side effect?
- I don't know. Anything Aquaman does.

00:15.862 --> 00:16.896
[laughs]

00:16.930 --> 00:18.330
Oh, you're wearing that t-shirt.

00:18.365 --> 00:20.265
I thought you were gonna
swap it out for a nightie,

00:20.299 --> 00:22.767
- something tight.
- That's so complicated.

00:22.801 --> 00:24.769
It's hard tell what's the
front and what's the back,

00:24.803 --> 00:26.604
where everything is so
clear about this shirt.

00:26.638 --> 00:28.072
My head goes here;
my arms go here...

00:28.107 --> 00:30.408
And you wipe your
hands here, which is hot.

00:30.442 --> 00:32.810
Clean hands are hot.

00:34.613 --> 00:37.647
- Parents, we need to talk.
- Talk or knock?

00:37.681 --> 00:40.984
I have someone coming over tomorrow,
and not that it should matter,

00:41.019 --> 00:43.287
but this someone
happens to be a lesbian.

00:43.321 --> 00:47.824
Reese is new at school, and
she needs me as a friend.

00:47.858 --> 00:50.827
I'm kind of known for
having a diverse crew

00:50.861 --> 00:52.828
that doesn't pigeonhole people,

00:52.862 --> 00:54.863
unlike the jocks,
the drama nerds, the mean girls,

00:54.898 --> 00:56.198
the freaks with the weird...

00:56.233 --> 00:58.434
I really don't want you
guys to blow this for me.

00:58.468 --> 01:02.371
- So that means no lesbian jokes.
- I don't think I know a lesbian joke.

01:02.406 --> 01:04.173
I know one lesbian
joke, but I don't get it.

01:04.206 --> 01:07.609
Well, I know, let's get eve's
lesbian friend to explain it to us.

01:10.746 --> 01:13.514
Are you guys online?
I can't seem to get on the internet.

01:13.549 --> 01:14.950
Yeah, we're downloading Quicken.

01:14.984 --> 01:17.819
Ha-ha-ha-ha, great computer joke.
Somebody call Dilbert.

01:17.853 --> 01:19.620
It's like, I don't even
know why I come in here.

01:19.655 --> 01:20.515
- Neither do I.
- What?

01:20.516 --> 01:21.859
Get out now.

01:21.958 --> 01:23.483
This door is locked.
No one comes in or out.

01:23.659 --> 01:26.560
It's just I'm fading fast.
So how about just top stuff.

01:26.594 --> 01:28.628
I'll take it.

01:28.663 --> 01:31.398
- How's this?
- [laughs] Stop tickling my feet.

01:31.433 --> 01:34.035
I'm nowhere near your feet, honey.

01:34.369 --> 01:37.237
- What's "top stuff?"
- I honestly don't even know anymore.

01:41.875 --> 01:43.742
Okay, that's it. We're
officially out of kids.

01:43.777 --> 01:44.743
[sighs]

01:44.778 --> 01:45.878
<i>[muffled voice]</i>

01:45.912 --> 01:47.546
Oh, come on.

01:47.581 --> 01:50.749
The upstairs neighbor thinks
we want to hear his TV again.

01:50.784 --> 01:52.618
Okay, I'm gonna go up there.

01:52.652 --> 01:55.188
<i>Probably some old guy
with a hearing aid.</i>

01:55.222 --> 01:58.823
He'll recognize me from the news,
I'll sign an autograph,

01:58.858 --> 02:02.427
and then I'll be right back down...
and you're asleep.

02:02.462 --> 02:05.163
I bet this never happens to Aquaman.

02:05.198 --> 02:08.699
Excuse me.

02:08.734 --> 02:10.102
- Oh, sorry... uh...
- Oh.

02:10.136 --> 02:14.438
Uh...
you're not an old man.

02:31.322 --> 02:32.489
- Oh, hey.
- So first of all...

02:32.523 --> 02:35.191
welcome to the building.
Lovely to have you.

02:35.226 --> 02:37.127
Second of all, and this
is dumb and so stupid.

02:37.161 --> 02:38.428
I feel funny even mentioning it,

02:38.462 --> 02:42.465
- but your TV is just a skosh loud...
- Oh, my god.

02:42.500 --> 02:45.600
Oh, okay. You know what?
I'm gonna turn it down.

02:45.635 --> 02:46.735
Come on in.

02:48.304 --> 02:51.173
- Okay, I'm allowed to do this.
- I had it turned up

02:51.207 --> 02:53.642
because I was baking
cookies in the kitchen.

02:53.676 --> 02:56.378
I've gotten back into
baking since my divorce.

02:56.413 --> 02:58.113
<i>My ex didn't like cookies.</i>

02:58.148 --> 03:00.915
Actually, the only thing
he hated more than cookies

03:00.949 --> 03:04.752
was not sleeping with baristas.

03:04.786 --> 03:08.489
I don't know why I'm telling you this.
I'm Kelly, by the way.

03:08.524 --> 03:11.426
- Do I know you from somewhere?
- Does this ring a bell?

03:11.460 --> 03:12.993
Stay informed, New York.

03:13.028 --> 03:14.628
- No.
- I'm Mike Henry.

03:14.663 --> 03:17.497
I'm a newscaster,
Channel 4... television.

03:17.532 --> 03:18.731
I know where I know you from.

03:18.766 --> 03:21.868
I used to see you at the
starbucks on 86th street.

03:21.902 --> 03:24.904
You're the guy with
those piercing blue eyes.

03:24.939 --> 03:29.609
Well, I don't know if they pierce.
They, uh... maybe poke a little.

03:29.643 --> 03:31.278

03:31.312 --> 03:35.013
- You're funny too.
- Oh, well... I should...

03:35.048 --> 03:37.216
I should probably hit the old hallway.

03:37.250 --> 03:40.619
Oh, wait. You know what?
Before you go, I need a taster.

bit heavy with the vanilla,</i>

chocolate chip, right?

one, but-but-but I...

Ugh, I'm so behind on
this article for Us Weekly.

04:19.524 --> 04:22.958
If it was called "Us Monthly,"
I'd have more time.

04:22.993 --> 04:26.028
- Us Monthly? Is that a new magazine?
- What? No.

04:26.062 --> 04:28.864
- Are you even listening?
- Crunchy? Swing and a miss, Mom.

04:28.898 --> 04:32.901
Hey, that's a school lunch
for my son who goes to school...

04:32.936 --> 04:36.138
- Okay, where was I?
- Uh... wrapping up.

04:36.172 --> 04:38.340
I like talking to Annie,
'cause she's a good listener,

04:38.374 --> 04:41.842
but I feel like she hasn't
really been there for me since...

04:43.546 --> 04:44.879
How old is Ian again?

04:44.913 --> 04:46.848
I know you're too busy
to hear my troubles.

04:46.882 --> 04:49.518
I guess it's hard for you
to imagine what it's like

04:49.552 --> 04:51.786
to be a single woman
freelancing in this dirty town

04:51.820 --> 04:53.720

Okay, Caroline in the City,
I'm gonna give you that one

04:55.957 --> 04:57.724

to watch Graham today.

Anything to get me
away from this laptop.

05:02.697 --> 05:05.065
They're not for breakfast.
They're not for you!

05:05.099 --> 05:08.180
Really? We don't own
one Melissa Etheridge CD?

05:08.602 --> 05:10.903
Well, I guess it's Obama's
America everywhere but here.

05:10.937 --> 05:12.738
- We have two K.D. Lang CDs.
- Who's he?

05:12.773 --> 05:14.440
Oh, honey, you've
got to do your research.

05:14.475 --> 05:15.941
You have a lesbian coming over.

- Okay, stop eating it.

05:22.149 --> 05:24.716
Honey, thank you so much
for getting the neighbor

05:24.750 --> 05:27.653
to turn down his TV last night.
What's he like?

05:27.687 --> 05:31.056
Um, neighborly.

05:31.090 --> 05:35.224
Just an average neighbor.
Standard face and body.

05:35.395 --> 05:37.462
She...
and she was a "she", by the way.

05:37.497 --> 05:41.332
She was otherwise totally forgettable.

05:41.366 --> 05:46.588
Oh, crunchy.
You did it again, honey.

05:47.306 --> 05:49.907
- No sandwich?
- We're out of bread.

You've got a lot going on.

06:11.829 --> 06:14.963
Thank you.
I do have a lot going on.

06:14.997 --> 06:17.266
I was just trying to explain
this to my sister-in-law,

06:17.300 --> 06:19.601
- but she doesn't get it.
- Well, I think you are

06:19.602 --> 06:22.137
doing the most important
job in the world.

06:22.171 --> 06:24.005
Well, it's definitely up there.

06:24.040 --> 06:25.708
And I've done it with
no help from anyone.

06:25.742 --> 06:28.309
- Well, what about the boy's father?
- Mike's no help.

06:28.344 --> 06:30.077
He gives me zero support.

06:30.112 --> 06:33.147
Single mothers are amazing.
You're a hero.

06:33.181 --> 06:37.385
Oh, no.
I'm not a...

06:37.419 --> 06:42.056
hero. I'm just doing what
any other single mother would.

06:42.090 --> 06:45.925
- But enough about me.
- Don't be silly. We're here for you.

06:45.960 --> 06:48.629
I do suppose I could vent a little.

06:48.663 --> 06:50.497
If you don't mind turning
off your cell phone,

06:50.531 --> 06:52.065
I'd really appreciate it.

06:53.501 --> 06:55.535
I don't know why people
are so down on the WNBA.

06:55.570 --> 06:57.371
- Are they?
- No, and they shouldn't be.

06:57.405 --> 07:00.173
I mean, I think it's even
better than real basketball.

07:00.207 --> 07:02.408
I mean, normal bask...

07:02.442 --> 07:06.211
I mean, who wants to watch
a bunch of sweaty guys anyway, right?

07:06.246 --> 07:07.280
What happened to my
leftover chick-fil-a?

07:07.314 --> 07:08.648
I left it in the fridge.

07:08.682 --> 07:11.450
Some super tolerant person
probably threw it in the trash

07:11.485 --> 07:13.653
because that company is all about hate.

07:13.687 --> 07:16.354
Yeah, hating dry, flavorless chicken.

07:16.389 --> 07:18.723
- 'Sup. I'm Ian.
- Reese.

07:18.758 --> 07:21.660
- Like the pieces.
- Uh, he's supposed to be in college.

07:21.694 --> 07:24.462
But I left to start
up my own start... up.

07:24.497 --> 07:26.798
- Like the social network.
- Exactly.

07:26.832 --> 07:28.366
Who do you want to
play you in the movie?

07:28.401 --> 07:30.502
Okay, time's up.

07:30.536 --> 07:32.270
She's cute.
What's her deal?

07:32.304 --> 07:34.338
<i>[whispering] Trust me.
She's not interested.</i>

07:34.372 --> 07:36.740
I don't know. I was feeling a vibe.

07:36.775 --> 07:39.009
Whoa, seriously, did you
throw out my chick-fil-a?

07:39.043 --> 07:42.112
Recently? Is it on the top?

07:42.146 --> 07:45.749
Honey.
We have the whole place to ourselves.

07:45.784 --> 07:48.218
And I got us some coffee
so we can stay awake.

07:48.252 --> 07:49.819
Dark roast,
if you know what I'm saying.

07:49.853 --> 07:51.821
I can't stop thinkin about our neighbor.

07:51.855 --> 07:54.056
You know, the plain, forgettable one?

07:54.090 --> 07:56.892
Oh, wait, yeah, right,
the one with the loud TV.

07:56.927 --> 07:58.928
I feel bad, like we
got off on the wrong foot.

07:58.962 --> 08:02.998
And I was thinking I should
go upstairs and apologize...

08:03.033 --> 08:04.366
<i>Hey, Mike.</i>

08:04.400 --> 08:07.836
But then she decided
to come down here instead.

08:09.339 --> 08:10.505
Coffee?

08:11.935 --> 08:14.203
<i>I should be going.
I just wanted to drop these off.</i>

08:14.237 --> 08:16.172
Turns out that if you
actually turn on the oven,

08:16.206 --> 08:18.573
you get cookies.
And the best part is,

08:18.607 --> 08:20.308
you don't have to lick them off a spoon.

08:20.842 --> 08:22.577
[laughs]

08:22.611 --> 08:24.712
Great nonsense talk.
Really silly stuff.

08:24.746 --> 08:28.048
- Well... thanks for coming by.
- It was so nice to meet you, Kelly.

08:28.083 --> 08:31.085
You too.
It'll be so awesome to have a nice,

08:31.119 --> 08:33.854
- cool friend in the building.
- Yeah.

08:33.888 --> 08:36.756
Shame on Mike
for not mentioning you.

08:36.789 --> 08:39.491
Okay, good hang.
Keep the TV down.

08:39.527 --> 08:40.793
- Bye.
- Bye.

08:43.996 --> 08:45.565
Well, she looked different last night.

08:45.600 --> 08:47.867
<i>I mean, you know, the light in
here must be very flattering,</i>

08:47.901 --> 08:50.136
which a credit to you, because
you look great in any light.

08:50.170 --> 08:52.605
Maybe you were so
busy licking her spoon

08:52.639 --> 08:54.206
that you couldn't get a good look.

08:54.241 --> 08:56.975
That was a pity lick.
She needed a win.

08:57.009 --> 08:59.211
You know, if I
didn't know any better,

08:59.246 --> 09:01.780
I'd say that you have
a little crush, Mike.

09:01.814 --> 09:03.014
I don't have a crush.

09:03.049 --> 09:06.317
Honestly, I had completely
forgotten about her.

09:06.352 --> 09:08.986
Oh, Kelly.

09:09.020 --> 09:12.523
<i>Kelly, no, we can't.
It's wrong.</i>

09:12.558 --> 09:14.191
- Okay.
- Okay, wait. Wake up.

09:14.226 --> 09:16.594
- Mike, wake up.
- Wh-what?

09:16.629 --> 09:17.795
You hit me. Did you hit me?

09:17.829 --> 09:19.897
You were talking in
your sleep about Kelly.

09:19.931 --> 09:22.399
Sounds like you put
up quite a struggle...

09:22.433 --> 09:24.934
right up until you
immediately had sex with her.

09:24.969 --> 09:26.670
You know, these meds
give me crazy dreams.

09:26.704 --> 09:29.939
I get it.
She's cute, she's funny,

09:29.974 --> 09:31.441
a bit of a heavy hand with the vanilla,

09:31.476 --> 09:34.711
but just admit that you
are attracted to her.

09:34.746 --> 09:36.580
Well, I suppose if you
were attracted to a guy,

09:36.614 --> 09:37.714
you'd just put that out there?

09:37.749 --> 09:40.182
Matt Damon, Ben Affleck,
Casey Affleck,

09:40.216 --> 09:42.385
the Wahlbergs, pretty
much whole Boston scene.

09:42.419 --> 09:43.719
- Okay, enough.
- Mike, come on.

09:43.754 --> 09:45.488
I just want you to be honest with me.

09:45.522 --> 09:47.540
I am being honest with you.

09:47.541 --> 09:49.558
I'm not attracted to Kelly.

09:49.593 --> 09:52.444
Fine.
You dream about whatever you

09:52.445 --> 09:55.397
want to dream about, okay?
I'm gonna get some sleep.

10:00.803 --> 10:02.103
Oh, Annie...

10:02.137 --> 10:06.808
Annie, you're so beautiful
and sexy and smart.

10:06.842 --> 10:09.678
- You're the whole package.
- Okay, just so you know,

10:09.712 --> 10:11.946
when you asleep, you don't shake.

10:11.980 --> 10:14.581
And also, you don't talk like a ghost.

10:14.616 --> 10:17.681
<i>I can't hear yoooouu.</i>

10:18.486 --> 10:19.821
<i>Ooooh.</i>

10:19.855 --> 10:22.756
So Mike had a sexy
dream about another woman.

10:22.791 --> 10:25.827
It just annoys me that
Mike won't be honest.

10:25.861 --> 10:28.428
If he were really being honest,
he'd tell you to burn that shirt.

10:28.462 --> 10:30.230
What does everybody
have against this shirt?

10:30.264 --> 10:32.199
I've seen you polish
silver with that.

10:32.233 --> 10:35.368
<i>I'm just saying maybe you could
step up your game a little.</i>

10:36.804 --> 10:41.540
You're right.
I missed a spot.

10:41.642 --> 10:42.908
[laughs]

10:42.943 --> 10:44.944
So remember, we're going
for an outfit that says,

10:44.978 --> 10:46.645
"I'm cool with alternative lifestyles."

10:46.679 --> 10:47.646
[knock at door]

10:47.680 --> 10:50.749
So is the lovely Reese coming today?

10:50.783 --> 10:52.952
I don't want to waste my Axe
body spray on just family.

10:52.986 --> 10:56.055
You're barking up the wrong tree.
This tree is a lesbian.

10:56.089 --> 10:58.290
If Reese is a lesbian, then
I must be a pretty lady,

10:58.325 --> 11:00.892
because she's definitely into me.
So am I Axe-ing or not?

11:00.926 --> 11:02.093
- Axe-ing.
- Not.

11:02.127 --> 11:03.528
I'm never bringing Reese back here.

11:03.563 --> 11:05.630
This place is a minefield
of embarrassment.

11:05.665 --> 11:08.099
- We're going to JJ's funcade.
- J to the Js.

11:08.133 --> 11:09.534
Food and games. Love that place.

11:09.569 --> 11:12.036
- Me too.
- There's my little Graham cracker.

11:12.071 --> 11:14.939
Red shoes, brown pants,
and yellow sweater?

11:14.974 --> 11:16.974
You trying to look like a hamburger?

11:17.008 --> 11:19.844
I had such a good time
watching you the other day, bud.

11:19.878 --> 11:21.945
I told your folks I'd
take you to the park again.

11:21.980 --> 11:23.881
Okay, I just wanted to
hang with those moms again.

11:23.915 --> 11:27.785
It felt nice to be around
people who appreciate what I do,

11:27.819 --> 11:30.454
Even if it's just
something I pretend to do.

11:30.489 --> 11:35.425
- Let's go to JJ's funcade instead.
- The park is nature's funcade.

11:35.459 --> 11:38.327
- The park doesn't have prizes.
- Well, that's where you're wrong.

11:38.362 --> 11:41.664
If we go to the park, you win a soda.

11:41.699 --> 11:45.034
I like soda.
Can I drink it through a twizzler?

11:45.068 --> 11:46.636
Half a twizzler.

11:46.670 --> 11:48.837
I feel like I'd make a good mom.

11:48.872 --> 11:52.408
And now just because
I had a dream about her...

11:52.442 --> 11:54.009
and didn't tell her I was married...

11:54.043 --> 11:57.178
and licked a few spoons,
Annie thinks I'm into her.

11:57.213 --> 11:58.647
Women.

11:58.681 --> 12:01.683
Always jumping to conclusions
based on overwhelming evidence.

12:02.685 --> 12:06.086
I got it. I got it.
We'll double date.

12:06.121 --> 12:08.088
I'll set you up with Kelly,
and then Annie will know

12:08.123 --> 12:09.624
that I don't find her attractive.

12:09.658 --> 12:11.959
Oh, hold on.
She's not attractive?

12:11.993 --> 12:13.895
You're trying to set me
up with a jacked-up woman?

12:13.929 --> 12:15.296
Uh-uh. Oh, no.

12:15.330 --> 12:17.498
Word gets around town that
I've lowered my standards,

12:17.533 --> 12:20.233
my stock drops,
ladies go, "Sell. Sell on Harris."

12:20.267 --> 12:21.668
That's just economics.

12:21.702 --> 12:25.138
Trust me. She's sufficiently jacked.
She's jacked exquisitely.

12:25.172 --> 12:27.273
Just say you'll come to dinner.

12:27.308 --> 12:30.677
Okay, but she better look good,
because you see all this?

12:30.711 --> 12:32.879
It's too big to fail.

12:35.149 --> 12:37.917
<i>You think they can
tell we're not working?</i>

12:37.951 --> 12:40.753
<i>Oh, my god.
This place is ridiculous.</i>

12:40.787 --> 12:43.622
- You know what we should do?
- Pity the living?

12:43.657 --> 12:46.124
And... and we should tell the
waiter that it's my birthday,

12:46.159 --> 12:49.595
and then they'll have to
do that lame song for me.

12:49.629 --> 12:50.696
Is that your brother?

12:50.730 --> 12:51.896
[whistles]

12:51.931 --> 12:53.130
Ian, what are you doing here?

12:53.165 --> 12:55.500
Oh, hey.
Oh, I was just in the neighborhood.

12:55.534 --> 12:57.401
Thought I'd check out
the old stomping grounds.

12:57.436 --> 12:59.571
Hey, check out this old girl.

12:59.605 --> 13:04.075
Wonder if she still dance,
dances like she used to.

13:04.109 --> 13:06.177
No, no, no, no, no.
Don't do this.

13:06.211 --> 13:08.979
I barely remember
how to use this thing.

13:09.013 --> 13:10.581
Or do I totally remember?

13:12.016 --> 13:14.952
[frenetic music]

13:22.293 --> 13:24.694
<i>I'm so sorry.
He's trying to show off</i>

13:24.728 --> 13:26.662
<i>because he has a stupid crush on you.</i>

13:26.697 --> 13:31.000
That's okay.
This is hilarious.

13:31.034 --> 13:34.303
- Yeah, totally.
- It's, like, is the machine telling me

13:34.337 --> 13:36.171
what to do, or am I telling it?

13:38.557 --> 13:41.437
<i>I just want to get this
us weekly article right,</i>

13:41.472 --> 13:42.672
because I'm going to be
seeing it in my doctor's office

13:42.706 --> 13:44.039
for the next year and a half.

13:44.074 --> 13:47.142
Speaking of, does anyone else
have a super judge-y gyno?

13:47.335 --> 13:51.646
- Um, Leigh, is Graham okay?
- I am forever!

13:51.681 --> 13:55.817
He's fine. He just had a few
sodas and a couple twizzlers.

13:55.852 --> 13:57.886
Wow! That's a lot of sugar.

13:57.920 --> 13:59.788
I feel like we're
getting off track here.

13:59.822 --> 14:02.491
I never give Duncan
anything processed.

14:02.525 --> 14:05.426
Pretty high almighty for a lady
who named her son Duncan.

14:05.461 --> 14:08.061
You guys have really changed.

14:08.096 --> 14:12.633
Come on son, we're leaving.

14:12.701 --> 14:14.702
<i>[lower voice] Graham, that's you!</i>

14:14.769 --> 14:17.304
- Leigh, it's you!
- Graham, slow down!

14:17.580 --> 14:20.154
I'm not wearing the
right bra for this!

14:20.837 --> 14:24.443
- Have you seen Reese?
- She's over there.

14:27.147 --> 14:28.648

<i>[laughs] Oh. Oh, god.
You are awful.</i>

14:36.824 --> 14:39.525
We'd have a lot less dishes
to do if you would just admit

14:39.559 --> 14:41.894
that you have a crush on Kelly.

14:41.928 --> 14:45.998
That's ridiculous.
It's a legitimate double date.

14:46.032 --> 14:48.667
They do seem to be hitting it off.

14:48.701 --> 14:50.536
[laughter]

14:50.570 --> 14:53.772
Yes, they do, don't they?

14:53.806 --> 14:56.040
- That was our thing.
- What?

14:56.074 --> 14:58.029
Nothing.

14:58.410 --> 14:59.744
- Oh.
- Bread time.

14:59.778 --> 15:03.714
Individual portions of bread that
everyone can feed to themselves.

Oops, Parkinson's.

15:05.017 --> 15:06.417
[groans]

15:08.153 --> 15:11.022
What?
Parkinson's.

15:11.056 --> 15:13.990
Uh...

15:14.025 --> 15:15.692
Why were you making out with Ian?

15:15.726 --> 15:18.394
Oh, you saw that? I'm sorry.
I know he's your brother, and...

15:18.429 --> 15:21.965
Yeah, and... brothers are guys.

15:21.999 --> 15:25.401
- You're a lesbian.
- No, I'm not.

15:25.436 --> 15:27.470
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, I'm sure.

15:27.504 --> 15:29.171
But I heard that you
kissed a girl at a party.

15:29.205 --> 15:31.674
Yeah, I did, but only
'cause guys love that.

15:32.742 --> 15:35.444
Hey, air swimmer clownfish.

15:35.478 --> 15:38.565
- No bigs.
- I can't believe this.

15:41.484 --> 15:45.553
Let me get some more of that.
Somehow yours just seems better.

15:45.588 --> 15:48.823
<i>So you guys have been friends forever.</i>

15:48.857 --> 15:51.258
Oh, yeah, ever since we
started out down in Orlando.

15:51.293 --> 15:54.095
Remember when we covered the...
Governor's inauguration?

15:54.129 --> 15:55.997
Yeah, Mike camped out
in the Governor's office

15:56.031 --> 15:57.565
and wouldn't leave until we got a quote.

15:57.600 --> 15:59.633
And you got caught in the press
room with that salsa dancer.

15:59.667 --> 16:02.202
Or wait, no, that's wrong.
It was a cocktail waitress.

16:02.236 --> 16:06.673
- It's hard to remember, I'm sure.
- Yeah, because there's been so many.

16:06.708 --> 16:09.676
I was gonna say because
it was such a long time ago.

16:09.711 --> 16:12.145
Everybody does crazy
things when they're young.

16:12.179 --> 16:13.446
But I'm a gentleman now.

16:13.481 --> 16:15.381
Well, I hope not too
much of a gentleman.

16:15.416 --> 16:17.583
Didn't that cocktail waitress
turn out to be a gentleman

16:17.618 --> 16:21.120
- in the end... and in the front?
- What the hell are you doing?

16:21.154 --> 16:23.656
Just trying to be accurate.
Who wants to see my Emmys?

16:23.690 --> 16:27.059
Don't get too excited.
They're daytime Emmys.

16:27.094 --> 16:28.527
Just trying to be accurate.

16:30.897 --> 16:33.364
You're right, this place
is better than the park.

16:33.398 --> 16:36.300
I'm sorry. I shouldn't
have used you like I did.

16:36.335 --> 16:38.402
<i>I guess it just felt nice
to get a little validation</i>

16:38.437 --> 16:42.223
out there, and look,
i know there are harder things

16:42.224 --> 16:46.745
- than writing a 200-word article.
- 200? That's so many words.

16:46.779 --> 16:50.147
Thank you.
Finally someone in this family gets me.

16:50.181 --> 16:52.582
You know, I'm going to start
coming to you with my problems.

16:52.617 --> 16:54.752
[groans]
Would your son like a balloon?

16:54.786 --> 16:56.453
Oh, he's not my son.

16:56.487 --> 16:59.657
Oh, of course.
You're too young to have a son his age.

16:59.691 --> 17:01.659
Text your mom to pick you up.

17:01.693 --> 17:04.926
- So how long have you worked here?
- Oh, 13 years.

17:04.962 --> 17:07.563
Here I am with the children
of the Grand Popo tribe.

17:07.597 --> 17:09.298
<i>They wrote a song about me.</i>

17:09.332 --> 17:12.801
- Wow. That's amazing, Mike.
- It's really not that amazing.

17:12.836 --> 17:14.470
They sing that song
to all the white people

17:14.503 --> 17:15.771
to convince them to buy scarves.

17:15.806 --> 17:19.008
- Still driving that $100,000 car, Harris?
- Actually...

17:19.042 --> 17:20.241
Yeah, I remember when
he first got that car.

17:20.276 --> 17:22.911
I remember thinking, "whoa, mid-life crisis
comes early for Harris."

17:22.944 --> 17:24.612
<i>Well, actually, not that early.</i>

17:24.646 --> 17:26.815
You know, we might be
friends, but I'll take you out.

17:26.848 --> 17:29.217
- It's not that hard.
- Oh, hey, it's Leigh.

17:29.251 --> 17:31.653
I guess she wants us to pick
up Graham at JJ's funcade.

17:31.688 --> 17:34.756
Well, sorry, guys.
I guess we've got to call it a night.

17:34.791 --> 17:37.091
Well, Kelly and Harris
don't have to call it a night.

17:37.125 --> 17:40.260
- I'm not going to say no to a drink.
- Oh, you are my kind of guy.

17:40.295 --> 17:41.796
I know.
Why don't we all go to JJ's?

17:41.830 --> 17:44.699
And we can play a little skee-ball
and get some nachos for the big fella.

17:44.733 --> 17:47.768
- You better stop that.
- You know, I think I better get going.

17:47.803 --> 17:50.771
I have an early morning tomorrow.
Do you want to walk me up upstairs?

17:50.806 --> 17:52.405
Don't be silly. It's
completely out of his way.

17:52.439 --> 17:53.773
I'll walk you upstairs,

17:53.808 --> 17:56.142
and Annie and I will drop
Harris off at home on our way.

17:56.177 --> 17:58.411
And then maybe we could
stop by JJ's tomorrow.

17:58.445 --> 18:02.515
- Mike, we need to pick up our son.
- You're absolutely right, Annie.

18:02.549 --> 18:04.851
You should take Kelly
home and them come back

18:04.885 --> 18:07.153
and man the nerve center, and
Harris and I will go get Graham.

18:07.188 --> 18:09.855
- I don't want to do that at all.
- Here's an out-of-the-box idea.

18:09.889 --> 18:12.107
Why doesn't nobody take Kelly
home, 'cause she only lives

18:12.108 --> 18:14.326
one floor up, and it's a safe
building. And she'll be fine.

18:14.360 --> 18:16.962
Isn't that right, Annie?
Annie?

18:16.996 --> 18:19.264
You know, I have some
more spoons upstairs.

18:19.298 --> 18:21.934
[both chuckling]

18:21.968 --> 18:24.068
For the record, don't touch my belly.

18:24.103 --> 18:25.903
Now, if you will excuse
me, I'm going upstairs

18:25.938 --> 18:28.844
to make love with my shirt on.

18:30.675 --> 18:32.483
Thank you for leaving me
with that image.

18:32.791 --> 18:34.926
<i>Annie, it's Mike again.
Are you still here? </i>

18:34.992 --> 18:37.198
'Cause I've been walking
around for 20 minutes.

18:37.316 --> 18:39.112
I'm a sweaty guy
lurking around an arcade.

18:39.146 --> 18:40.313
People are starting
to think I'm a creep.

18:40.347 --> 18:42.415
Hey! Are you leaving?

18:42.449 --> 18:43.849
- Yeah.
- You're seriously bailing?

18:43.883 --> 18:46.518
- Is this because Reese is into me?
- That is mystifying.

18:46.552 --> 18:49.121
- Mm.
- She just isn't who I thought she was.

18:49.155 --> 18:51.190
Who cares?
So Reese isn't a lesbian.

18:51.224 --> 18:53.158
I'm sorry that's not
a box you can check off

18:53.193 --> 18:56.361
- on your list of friends.
- I like having friends who are unique.

18:56.395 --> 18:58.030
Yeah, so you can feel unique.

18:58.064 --> 19:01.232
Why not just have friends
because they're your friends?

19:01.266 --> 19:04.969
<i>Annie.
Annie, I know you're here somewhere.</i>

19:05.003 --> 19:07.404
<i>Look, you were right.
I had a crush on Kelly.</i>

19:07.439 --> 19:09.373
- Is that Dad?
- I'm afraid so.

19:09.407 --> 19:11.042
<i>She had these well-defined collarbones</i>

19:11.076 --> 19:13.010
<i>that could hold water in the rain.</i>

19:13.045 --> 19:15.345
<i>I didn't even know I was into that.</i>

19:15.379 --> 19:17.714
<i>But I never should have...</i>

19:17.749 --> 19:19.549
<i>[in garbled robotic voice]
licked the spoon.</i>

19:19.583 --> 19:21.184
<i>I got caught up in the moment.</i>

19:21.219 --> 19:24.254
<i>Why do I sound like this?
What's happening to me?</i>

19:24.288 --> 19:27.224
<i>Am I a robot?</i>

19:27.258 --> 19:28.725
[in normal voice] Oh, that's better.

19:28.760 --> 19:29.760
<i>Where was I?</i>

19:29.794 --> 19:34.196
- Finished, hopefully.
- Oh, wait. Annie, I'm sorry.

19:34.231 --> 19:36.932
Look, I just got started,
and I couldn't stop.

19:36.967 --> 19:38.768
Mike, I don't even care about that.

19:38.802 --> 19:43.172
I mean, the collarbone thing was
weird, but what got into you tonight?

19:44.674 --> 19:46.708
I'm sorry. I...

19:46.743 --> 19:49.310
I just... it wasn't even
that I had a crush on Kelly.

19:49.344 --> 19:51.880
It was that Kelly had a crush on me.

19:53.249 --> 19:54.448
It's just nice to know
after all that's happened

19:54.483 --> 19:59.487
- that women still find me attractive.
- What about me?

19:59.521 --> 20:02.290
- I think you're attractive.
- Oh, well, that doesn't count.

20:02.324 --> 20:03.523
I mean, what are you gonna do,

20:03.557 --> 20:05.325
leave the beloved
newsman with Parkinson's?

20:05.359 --> 20:07.094
Okay, if that's what
you're worried about,

20:07.128 --> 20:09.329
I will leave you the
minute your looks go.

20:09.363 --> 20:11.164
I'd appreciate that. Thank you.

20:11.198 --> 20:12.398
Look... hey, have you been
wearing this all night?

20:12.432 --> 20:13.833
You look amazing.

20:13.867 --> 20:16.235
Yes, I've been trying to
get you to notice all night.

20:16.270 --> 20:19.071
If I told you you were beautiful
every time you looked beautiful,

20:19.106 --> 20:22.474
- I'd never have time for anything else.
- That would be fine with me.

20:26.280 --> 20:28.046
Sometimes in life,
you get turned around

20:28.080 --> 20:29.848
and forget who you really are.

20:29.882 --> 20:32.150
Sorry I thought you were a lesbian.

20:32.185 --> 20:35.086
That's okay.
I thought you were too.

20:35.121 --> 20:37.155
Oh, boss!
Are you guys gonna kiss?!

20:37.190 --> 20:40.625
<i>Luckily, your family
is there to remind you.</i>

20:40.659 --> 20:43.227
<i>They're the ones who challenge you</i>

20:43.261 --> 20:44.528
<i>and support you</i>

20:44.562 --> 20:47.397
and love you no matter what.

20:47.432 --> 20:50.500
- Hey guys, guys...
- What, sweetie?

20:50.535 --> 20:53.003
We lost Dad.

20:53.073 --> 20:55.472
Shh, shh.

20:57.342 --> 20:59.175
Mike, Mike.

21:02.112 --> 21:04.314
How did you find me?

21:04.348 --> 21:08.051
<i>♪ So if you want to drive

21:08.085 --> 21:09.919
They're also the ones

21:09.954 --> 21:12.722
with remote control fish balloons.

21:12.756 --> 21:14.290
Ian, get that thing out of here!

21:14.325 --> 21:16.291
