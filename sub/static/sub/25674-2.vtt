36:17.049 --> 36:19.343
What are we doing here?
You know I believe in science.

36:43.743 --> 36:46.746
Hail Maria, full of grace.

36:46.829 --> 36:48.915
The Lord has abandoned thee.

36:48.998 --> 36:49.916
I don't think those are the lyrics.

36:52.543 --> 36:54.629
Maria.

36:54.712 --> 36:57.215
Hated art thou amongst women.

36:57.924 --> 36:59.759
You have led us into great trouble.

36:59.842 --> 37:02.511
And now someone must pay for those sins.

37:03.137 --> 37:07.475
Someone will pay with many years.

37:07.558 --> 37:10.811
And if it is not you, Maria,

37:11.604 --> 37:13.981
it will be us.

37:19.111 --> 37:21.614
Holy Maria!

37:21.697 --> 37:24.700
We thank you for taking the blame,

37:25.785 --> 37:29.747
because that is the only way
we will save ourselves.

41:59.308 --> 42:01.936
Then would you prefer we speak in Spanish,

42:02.019 --> 42:04.522
because that wouldn't be a problem for me.

42:05.564 --> 42:08.484
Why does everyone know Spanish
all of the sudden?

42:09.693 --> 42:12.780
I miss when English
was America's official language.

42:12.863 --> 42:14.198
Changing demographics.

42:15.866 --> 42:17.284
I thought they were going to build a wall.

42:17.368 --> 42:18.702
What happened to the wall?

42:19.578 --> 42:20.955
What happened to the door over there?

42:24.458 --> 42:27.002
Don't worry about this door.

42:27.086 --> 42:30.798
Just try to help us understand
why people are saying

42:30.881 --> 42:34.468
that you were responsible
for locking doors during the riot.

42:47.147 --> 42:52.069
Blanca, we can only help you
if you help us.

42:58.576 --> 43:02.204
Maria threatened to throw me
in with the guards,

43:03.247 --> 43:05.666
and torture me if I didn't help her.
