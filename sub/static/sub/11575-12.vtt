WEBVTT

00:06.632 --> 00:08.714
I'm probably just
overreacting--

00:09.552 --> 00:11.964
And Lauren if you're here
and you're just ignoring me.

00:12.221 --> 00:14.052
I'm sorry for
breaking in!

00:16.017 --> 00:16.426
See?

00:16.684 --> 00:18.049
It's weird, right?

00:18.311 --> 00:21.474
She hasn't come by, she hasn't
answered any of my... calls.

00:26.235 --> 00:28.317
Why would anyone leave
their cellphone at home?

00:28.571 --> 00:29.356
Ever?

00:29.614 --> 00:30.524
Maybe she just forgot it.

00:30.781 --> 00:33.033
Don't do that Dyson.
I am not crazy--

00:33.284 --> 00:34.148
Bo, I know
you're not crazy

00:34.410 --> 00:37.026
but I'm in the middle of the
biggest case of my life,

00:37.288 --> 00:38.824
not to mention today is
Hale's inauguration.

00:39.081 --> 00:40.992
I don't have time to play
relationship detective.

00:41.250 --> 00:42.626
Look, I will run the
numbers on her cell

00:42.877 --> 00:43.707
as soon as | get
back to the office,

00:43.961 --> 00:44.791
maybe I can scare her up.

00:45.046 --> 00:47.503
God, maybe I am going crazy.

00:47.757 --> 00:50.373
Have you ever thought that
with the stress of The Dawning,

00:50.635 --> 00:51.044
and the break-up--

00:51.302 --> 00:52.838
It is a break.

00:53.930 --> 00:56.091
Yeah, even I don't
buy that line anymore.

00:57.183 --> 00:59.094
[Humming]

00:59.352 --> 01:00.842
You're awful chipper.

01:01.103 --> 01:04.015
My protégé is officially
becoming The Ash.

01:04.273 --> 01:07.106
Of course I'm chipper. It was
good that l was hard on him.

01:07.360 --> 01:08.691
Hale's gonna make
a real change.

01:08.945 --> 01:09.730
Oh, yeah.

01:09.987 --> 01:11.898
Is he not gonna be
such a dick anymore?

01:14.825 --> 01:16.907
[Whispered] You need to put
your personal feelings aside.

01:17.161 --> 01:19.994
This is a big day for the Fae--
they're not gonna take kindly

01:20.248 --> 01:21.533
to a human belittling it.

01:21.791 --> 01:25.955
Do the Light always hold their
inaugurations at a Steakhouse?

01:26.212 --> 01:28.043
What are you doing here?

01:28.297 --> 01:30.162
Regardless of the fact
the last time the Light

01:30.424 --> 01:32.881
elected a new leader he
turned out to be an impostor,

01:33.135 --> 01:36.377
I am only here with good
wishes for The New Ash.

01:36.639 --> 01:38.550
It is unacceptable
for the Dark leader

01:38.808 --> 01:40.799
to attend a Light
Fae Inauguration.

01:41.060 --> 01:42.049
But I was invited.

01:42.311 --> 01:43.471
By who.

01:44.272 --> 01:45.307
By me.

01:46.148 --> 01:48.355
Nope! Still a dick.

01:52.947 --> 01:55.654
Life is hard when you
don't know who you are.

01:55.908 --> 01:58.741
It's harder when you
don't know what you are.

01:58.995 --> 02:01.236
My love carries
a death sentence.

02:02.039 --> 02:06.829
l was lost for years.
Searching while hiding.

02:07.086 --> 02:10.249
Only to find that I belong
to a world hidden from humans.

02:11.257 --> 02:15.500
I won't hide anymore.
I will live the life I choose.

02:23.978 --> 02:26.094
Neurotoxin is showing
predicted signs,

02:26.355 --> 02:30.769
plaque is going rigid,
toxin is breaking down.

02:31.027 --> 02:34.269
Applying A54 Enzyme
to repair toxin...

02:47.209 --> 02:48.540
It worked.

02:49.795 --> 02:51.205
It worked!

02:53.090 --> 02:54.955
We're one step closer
to heart disease.

02:55.217 --> 02:56.832
Or curing it.

02:57.094 --> 02:59.881
[Clapping and laughter]

03:00.139 --> 03:02.095
I'm sorry... uh, sorry.

03:02.350 --> 03:05.513
It's just been a long time
since I've felt this useful.

03:06.729 --> 03:08.014
Hey, let's celebrate.

03:08.272 --> 03:09.933
Wow, that's a
little presumptious.

03:10.191 --> 03:11.431
To have champagne in the lab.

03:11.692 --> 03:14.069
Since this was our
first test run, no?

03:14.320 --> 03:16.606
No. I knew you'd do it.

03:18.157 --> 03:19.112
Drink up there, genious.

03:20.159 --> 03:23.902
Sure yeah, I just
I wanna text my--

03:24.413 --> 03:25.277
[Small laugh]

03:25.539 --> 03:26.198
You okay?

03:26.457 --> 03:29.745
Yeah... yes.

03:30.002 --> 03:30.457
Alright.

03:30.711 --> 03:31.826
Let's drink.

03:33.297 --> 03:34.628
Lauren Lewis everybody.

03:34.882 --> 03:35.871
Cheers!

03:59.657 --> 04:02.114
For my best friend.
On a big day.

04:07.915 --> 04:08.779
Slancha.

04:17.383 --> 04:18.748
Damn.

04:19.009 --> 04:21.170
That is some good hooch.

04:22.221 --> 04:25.634
Hate to ruin such
a fine aftertaste,

04:25.891 --> 04:27.597
but what's the latest?

04:29.228 --> 04:31.435
We're still
processing the bodies.

04:31.689 --> 04:32.804
Eighteen so far--

04:33.065 --> 04:34.271
Both Light and Dark.

04:34.525 --> 04:37.642
And... it looks like
they were tortured.

04:38.112 --> 04:39.272
Tortured.

04:39.530 --> 04:42.192
Yeah... and some of the vics
are missing their organs.

04:42.450 --> 04:46.238
So black market
Fae organ harvesters?

04:46.495 --> 04:47.996
Tell me you have a lead.

04:48.247 --> 04:49.157
Not yet.

04:51.208 --> 04:52.323
Alright, soon
as I'm sworn in.

04:52.585 --> 04:54.951
I'm gonna have to have a
sit-down with The Morrigan.

04:55.212 --> 04:57.123
See if we can't
pool our resources.

05:02.136 --> 05:03.922
This is what I want, right?

05:04.597 --> 05:06.713
It's what everyone wants.

05:06.974 --> 05:08.214
Change.

05:14.273 --> 05:16.980
I'm proud of my old partner.

05:17.234 --> 05:19.520
Miss my old partner.

05:20.279 --> 05:21.314
Me too.

05:22.198 --> 05:23.654
Which reminds me.

05:23.908 --> 05:25.114
Yeah...

05:29.872 --> 05:31.328
Is that what I think it is?

05:31.582 --> 05:34.244
Your father didn't want the
first Ash from Clan Zamora

05:34.502 --> 05:38.336
in 100 years to stick his neck
out only to have it chopped off.

05:41.175 --> 05:43.962
This little baby
should keep you safe.

05:44.220 --> 05:45.960
It's nice to know he
worries about me--

05:46.222 --> 05:49.385
not enough to cancel his ski
trip to Chicag by the way but...

05:50.643 --> 05:51.974
Look, I gotta go.

05:52.228 --> 05:54.810
If I'm gonna show up my buddy
at his own Inauguration--

05:55.064 --> 05:55.974
Gotta change.

05:56.232 --> 05:56.971
Yes you do.

05:57.233 --> 05:59.144
Hair, attitude...

05:59.401 --> 06:01.232
Shit. I'd ask for a refund.

06:01.820 --> 06:03.151
Your Grace.

06:21.966 --> 06:23.831
[Clank!]

06:26.929 --> 06:27.918
Wow.

06:28.180 --> 06:30.136
You always bathe
with weapons?

06:35.354 --> 06:37.265
Moragh attack a
couple years back.

06:37.523 --> 06:38.729
Can't be too careful.

06:39.817 --> 06:41.978
And I thought the
door was locked.

06:43.028 --> 06:44.359
It was.

06:44.613 --> 06:45.602
Can I help you?

06:45.864 --> 06:49.573
No. Maybe.

06:50.327 --> 06:52.409
| just came here to
drink all your liquor.

06:52.663 --> 06:54.028
Thought you'd be gone by now.

06:54.290 --> 06:55.279
Wow.

06:55.541 --> 06:56.997
You're honest.

06:57.251 --> 06:58.457
I'll give you that.

07:00.129 --> 07:03.041
Well, we all
have our strengths.

07:03.966 --> 07:05.046
So...

07:05.301 --> 07:07.166
What up, Succubus?

07:08.012 --> 07:10.094
I'm not really in the
mood for small talk.

07:10.347 --> 07:11.211
Come on.

07:11.473 --> 07:13.930
Everyone loves small talk.

07:18.981 --> 07:21.017
lt's Lauren...

07:21.275 --> 07:24.062
I haven't seen her in a few
days and I'm worried about her.

07:24.320 --> 07:27.312
I'm sure she's fine,
she probably just needed--

07:27.573 --> 07:30.940
Needed some space, yes.

07:31.201 --> 07:32.452
Popular opinion.

07:34.246 --> 07:35.326
Anyway.

07:35.581 --> 07:37.287
Dyson has her phone,
he's running some numbers.

07:37.875 --> 07:42.289
So... this isn't small talk.

07:47.176 --> 07:49.292
You weren't the one who
killed the Blonde hottie.

07:52.640 --> 07:53.254
What?

07:55.100 --> 07:57.933
The six-fingered lady did.

07:58.187 --> 08:00.052
And then someone killed her.

08:00.314 --> 08:01.224
Big time.

08:02.232 --> 08:03.642
Wasn't you, was it?

08:04.109 --> 08:05.269
What about your
Dark Fae friend?

08:05.527 --> 08:06.983
The one in a coma.

08:09.198 --> 08:10.938
Him--

08:16.246 --> 08:20.285
It is entirely possible that
I do not smell so good.

08:21.835 --> 08:25.794
Well, take a page from
my book and take a bath.

08:38.644 --> 08:41.761
No, Tamsin,
I didn't mean...

08:45.401 --> 08:46.766
Okay then.

08:51.156 --> 08:52.191
Oops.

08:55.577 --> 08:58.444
Where do you get off
being so perfect.

09:01.333 --> 09:03.574
You think you've
seen everything...

09:05.546 --> 09:07.332
...and then you see you.

09:07.589 --> 09:12.800
|'m alright but
I'm not perfect.

09:15.305 --> 09:17.967
Yes you are.

09:18.225 --> 09:19.260
To me you are.

09:22.062 --> 09:26.055
Your eyes are both
brown and blue.

09:26.316 --> 09:27.931
Tamsin, what are you doing?

09:31.697 --> 09:37.943
Your heart is both
strong and gentle.

09:41.248 --> 09:43.330
You're virtuous.

09:45.043 --> 09:46.829
Yet you're a Succubus.

09:49.631 --> 09:51.167
You shouldn't be.

09:51.842 --> 09:53.833
Be what?

09:54.094 --> 09:56.881
Be real.

09:57.139 --> 09:59.380
Be here.

10:08.233 --> 10:08.983
Okay.

10:09.234 --> 10:11.646
I'll see you at
the Dal, I guess.

10:16.241 --> 10:18.618
You never know who
might be watching.

10:23.707 --> 10:24.537
We're at the nest.

10:24.792 --> 10:26.202
Target's on route.

10:29.963 --> 10:32.545
Trick, I don't
want to be here!

10:32.800 --> 10:34.882
Well then why are you
dressed to the nine's.

10:35.135 --> 10:37.091
Certainly not for
Hale's benefit.

10:37.346 --> 10:38.677
That guy sucks.

10:38.931 --> 10:44.892
Well, my bartender is late and
l have no one else to help me.

10:45.145 --> 10:48.387
No, you mean you have no
other humans to help you.

10:48.649 --> 10:50.389
You know, I think I'm
going to start a union

10:50.651 --> 10:51.390
for claimed humans.

10:51.652 --> 10:53.108
Bring in some
change of my own.

10:53.362 --> 10:56.104
You know, the last human
to try that didn't fare so well.

10:56.365 --> 10:57.775
Jimmy Hoffa ring any bells?

11:05.207 --> 11:08.916
I'm looking for a tall
blonde-- eyes like blue ice.

11:09.169 --> 11:10.909
Hi...
[Giggles]

11:11.171 --> 11:13.082
l have those eyes.

11:13.340 --> 11:15.956
Those are totally
like my eyes.

11:16.218 --> 11:17.378
Yes, you certainly do.
Tell me...

11:17.636 --> 11:21.845
You're not a natural blonde
by any chance, are you?

11:22.099 --> 11:23.589
Charmer.

11:23.851 --> 11:25.967
Tell me your name
isn't Dickface,

11:26.228 --> 11:28.093
King of the Douchebags?
Is it?

11:28.355 --> 11:29.060
| wish.

11:29.314 --> 11:30.975
No, it's Massimo.

11:31.233 --> 11:32.018
It means "the Greatest."

11:32.276 --> 11:33.516
The Greatest Douchebag.

11:33.777 --> 11:34.892
Yes, The Greatest Douchebag.

11:35.153 --> 11:36.438
You've figured me out.

11:36.697 --> 11:40.736
And you... you have a look
that is all too familiar to me.

11:40.993 --> 11:41.948
Out of your league?

11:42.202 --> 11:42.907
No.

11:43.161 --> 11:45.117
You're an outsider.

11:45.372 --> 11:47.658
You don't belong here, do you?

11:48.292 --> 11:49.498
Dude, who are you?

11:49.751 --> 11:50.456
Just a man who can
get you things.

11:50.711 --> 11:52.952
Make the impossible happen.

11:53.213 --> 11:57.047
Oh yeah, why don't you make
the impossible happen and...

11:57.301 --> 11:59.758
...disappear. Buh-bye.

12:02.723 --> 12:07.808
Okay, I'm gonna let you
get back to your chores.

12:17.195 --> 12:19.607
You still haven't told me
where you got that enzyme

12:19.865 --> 12:22.948
that | used to stabilize
the toxin with.

12:23.201 --> 12:26.739
I got it where I get everything
I can't get in North America.

12:26.997 --> 12:27.827
China.

12:28.081 --> 12:29.912
Oh...

12:32.794 --> 12:36.082
I'm really glad that
I met you, Isaac.

12:36.340 --> 12:38.422
I didn't realize it
but for a long time

12:38.675 --> 12:39.881
there's been
something missing

12:40.135 --> 12:42.751
you know, there's
been an emptiness...

12:43.013 --> 12:45.675
It's amazing what success can do
for emptiness, though, isn't it?

12:45.933 --> 12:46.342
I admit.

12:46.600 --> 12:48.591
It is a potent drug.

12:51.939 --> 12:55.306
Did you hear a story, it was in
the news about a year ago

12:55.567 --> 12:58.479
about a woman, waitress from
the midwest who was attacked

12:58.737 --> 13:01.900
and murdered at a diner,
did you read about that?

13:02.157 --> 13:06.150
This woman...
speared in the ribs,

13:06.411 --> 13:09.995
nailed down to the floor of the
diner in the shape of a cross.

13:10.248 --> 13:12.409
Oh, God. That's awful.

13:12.668 --> 13:13.953
It is.

13:14.211 --> 13:15.747
It was.

13:16.004 --> 13:18.996
The DNA of a killer named
Gabriel was all over the diner.

13:19.257 --> 13:20.633
Not to mention the fact that

13:20.884 --> 13:23.546
the crucifixion style
was also his M.O.

13:23.804 --> 13:25.089
I'm... I'm sorry.

13:25.347 --> 13:26.962
I'm not following.

13:27.224 --> 13:28.964
Did he die of heart disease?

13:29.226 --> 13:32.059
Have you seen this place yet?

13:32.312 --> 13:33.097
Nope.

13:33.355 --> 13:34.686
Let me show you around.

13:36.900 --> 13:38.015
Gabriel was strange.

13:38.276 --> 13:40.267
He didn't kill people who
annoyed him, didn't kill

13:40.529 --> 13:42.269
his neighbour because the
poodle snapped at him.

13:42.531 --> 13:44.897
He killed people because
he deemed them too good

13:45.158 --> 13:45.988
for the world.

13:46.243 --> 13:49.076
He deemed them
worthy to ascend...

13:49.329 --> 13:50.569
LAUREN: Did they catch him?

13:50.831 --> 13:52.822
Yes, but not for this murder.
When this murder happened

13:53.083 --> 13:54.823
he was serving three
consecutive life sentences

13:55.085 --> 13:57.292
in a maximum
security prison.

13:58.255 --> 14:00.712
Well, how were they able to
find his DNA at the scene?

14:00.966 --> 14:03.082
ISAAC: So before Gabriel was
hunted down and locked up,

14:03.343 --> 14:05.425
he was reading about this father
of two, James... something,

14:05.679 --> 14:07.886
who needed a bone
marrow transplant to live.

14:08.140 --> 14:10.552
Gabriel gave him his.

14:11.101 --> 14:13.057
You're not suggesting
that the bone marrow...

14:13.311 --> 14:14.517
Completely took over
and replaced his

14:14.771 --> 14:15.851
actual physical cell structure?

14:16.106 --> 14:17.937
Yes. I am.

14:18.191 --> 14:19.306
What do you
think James said

14:19.568 --> 14:21.650
when he was asked why
he murdered that waitress?

14:21.903 --> 14:23.359
That she was too
good for this world?

14:23.613 --> 14:24.363
That she should ascend?

14:24.614 --> 14:27.856
Just think what good we
could do if we could find a way

14:28.118 --> 14:33.283
to turn that negative
into a positive.

14:34.291 --> 14:35.997
LAUREN: I agree there
could be great benefit

14:36.251 --> 14:38.708
but this kind of procedure
lends itself to slide down

14:38.962 --> 14:40.372
some very slippery slopes.

14:40.630 --> 14:43.292
It could be used to create
more killers, like James.

14:43.550 --> 14:44.665
ISAAC: So wait,
you're a scientist,

14:44.926 --> 14:47.008
but you don't believe that
humans were meant to ascend,

14:47.262 --> 14:49.878
or to improve, or to evolve?

14:50.140 --> 14:52.381
Why shouldn't we use all
the tools we've been given?

14:52.642 --> 14:55.133
We should, I'm just saying
that we also need to remember

14:55.395 --> 14:56.475
those tools have given us...

14:56.730 --> 14:57.936
...a possible cure
for heart disease,

14:58.190 --> 15:00.055
a cure for polio,
mumps, measles...

15:00.317 --> 15:02.603
...and the Atom Bomb.

15:06.573 --> 15:08.359
Did we just have
our first fight?

15:14.122 --> 15:16.078
For now... congratulations.

15:18.293 --> 15:19.328
Come on!

15:20.921 --> 15:22.536
Jerry, where the
hell have you been?

15:22.798 --> 15:24.254
Stuck in traffic
and I forgot my keys...

15:24.508 --> 15:26.294
You know what?
I don't wanna hear it.

15:26.551 --> 15:28.837
Just get behind the bar
and start pouring drinks.

15:29.096 --> 15:31.257
I have to finish
getting dressed.

15:36.019 --> 15:36.769
A whiskey.

15:37.020 --> 15:38.305
The Scottish kind, please.

15:47.572 --> 15:48.778
What?

15:49.032 --> 15:52.274
I have never seen anything
so beautiful in my life.

15:52.536 --> 15:53.992
Thank you.

15:54.246 --> 15:56.703
You're not so bad yourself.

15:57.457 --> 15:58.958
Can I buy you a free drink?

15:59.209 --> 16:00.198
What a gentleman.

16:00.460 --> 16:01.449
I accept.

16:02.671 --> 16:05.913
Uh, bar-keep, the lady
will have Champagne?

16:06.174 --> 16:07.163
Uh, no.

16:07.425 --> 16:09.040
The lady will have whiskey,
the Scottish kind.

16:09.302 --> 16:10.883
And make it a double.

16:12.848 --> 16:14.964
You just keep getting better
and better, don't you?

16:15.225 --> 16:16.635
I'd like to think so.

16:21.523 --> 16:24.265
I can only have one drink,
then I wanna talk to Hale.

16:24.526 --> 16:26.016
See if he knows
where Lauren is.

16:26.278 --> 16:27.484
Anything on her phone?

16:27.737 --> 16:28.647
Not yet.

16:28.905 --> 16:30.441
After the ceremony.
I promise.

16:30.699 --> 16:35.193
J) foreboding music 1’

16:38.206 --> 16:41.414
To a new Fae
under the right man.

16:41.668 --> 16:43.124
To that dress
under the right man.

16:43.378 --> 16:46.791
Ohhh... drink
your whiskey, wolf.

16:54.139 --> 16:56.050
You mind if I take a look?

17:07.485 --> 17:08.565
Thank you.

17:55.367 --> 17:59.781
Yeah hi, I'll uh...
I'll need those files.

18:12.342 --> 18:16.130
If it wasn't punishable by
death I'd give you a taste...

18:16.388 --> 18:17.503
Handsome.

18:17.764 --> 18:20.301
Congratulations On Your
Big Day card would be fine.

18:20.558 --> 18:21.343
Really.

18:21.601 --> 18:24.684
Oh, I so hope you
don't get murdered.

18:24.938 --> 18:26.678
With all the death threats.

18:26.940 --> 18:28.055
Finding your killer
would be like

18:28.316 --> 18:30.853
finding a needle
in a whore stack.

18:31.111 --> 18:33.648
If we're gonna work together,
I need you to be less

18:33.905 --> 18:36.738
AII Bout Eve, a little more
Steel Magnolias. You feel me?

18:36.992 --> 18:40.701
Which one was about the
haircut that gives you cancer?

18:40.954 --> 18:42.319
Go away.

18:52.173 --> 18:53.629
What is she doing here?

18:53.883 --> 18:55.748
Wow, don't you look lovely.

18:56.011 --> 18:56.841
Ahh...

18:58.221 --> 19:00.337
Thank you.

19:00.598 --> 19:01.678
Loo k--

19:01.933 --> 19:04.470
I can't find Lauren.

19:04.728 --> 19:06.810
Do you have any idea
where she might be?

19:07.063 --> 19:08.519
I really do not
need this today.

19:08.773 --> 19:09.853
What? Do you
know something?

19:10.108 --> 19:11.939
Lauren came to me the
other day asking about

19:12.193 --> 19:14.184
some time off to work
on another project--

19:14.446 --> 19:15.561
And you told her no.

19:15.822 --> 19:16.902
In no uncertain terms.

19:17.157 --> 19:18.988
That makes me feel better.

19:19.242 --> 19:21.608
I mean not that she
didn't listen to you, but...

19:21.870 --> 19:23.406
you know what I mean.

19:25.248 --> 19:25.782
Something to eat?

19:26.041 --> 19:26.951
Nothing for me.

19:27.208 --> 19:29.164
But The Acting Ash
might be a little peckish.

19:34.424 --> 19:35.960
Now off you go.

19:38.803 --> 19:40.885
Please just give me
some time to find her.

19:41.139 --> 19:42.379
End of day--

19:42.640 --> 19:45.017
Then I put my people on this.
Girlfriend or not,

19:45.268 --> 19:47.099
this is a security issue
for the Light, understand?

19:47.354 --> 19:49.015
Thank you.

19:49.856 --> 19:52.848
You look really...

19:53.109 --> 19:54.315
Official.

19:56.279 --> 19:58.019
[Zap!]

19:59.532 --> 20:00.396
Shit.

20:01.743 --> 20:02.858
Glad someone thinks so.

20:10.835 --> 20:12.996
You should really try
the hors d'oeuvres.

20:13.254 --> 20:15.336
They're generating
quite the buzz.

20:15.590 --> 20:17.000
[Smack!]

20:28.144 --> 20:29.133
Dyson!

20:29.396 --> 20:30.932
I don't know what
happened he just collapsed.

20:31.189 --> 20:31.974
Oh my God!

20:32.232 --> 20:34.268
Dyson! Dyson look at me!
Dyson!

20:34.526 --> 20:36.062
I called the Paramedics.

20:37.695 --> 20:37.945
Hurry!

20:38.196 --> 20:39.026
Please!

20:39.280 --> 20:40.816
What's wrong with him?

20:41.241 --> 20:42.777
He's going to be fine ma'am.

20:43.034 --> 20:43.864
Fine?

20:44.119 --> 20:45.529
What do you mean
he's going to be fine?

20:47.122 --> 20:48.783
Whoa.

20:49.040 --> 20:50.576
Are you boys Skunk Apes?

20:50.834 --> 20:52.574
Just let us do our job ma'am.

20:54.003 --> 20:56.039
It's just that--
Dyson is part Wanblee.

20:56.297 --> 20:58.003
Is that going
to be an issue?

20:58.258 --> 20:59.543
Nope, he's
gonna be okay.

21:00.510 --> 21:01.875
Skunk Apes are
poisonous to Wanblees

21:02.137 --> 21:04.093
and you think he's
gonna be okay?

21:07.308 --> 21:08.218
Oh my god.

21:12.105 --> 21:13.060
You guys are human!

21:13.314 --> 21:16.772
I will open fire on the
next thing that moves.

21:17.318 --> 21:20.856
The next room is full of
some pretty bad-ass people.

21:21.114 --> 21:23.275
Maybe I should give
them a little whistle.

21:23.533 --> 21:24.158
Kenzi, no!

21:24.409 --> 21:25.615
[Grunts]

21:25.869 --> 21:27.029
Ugh.

21:38.173 --> 21:39.037
[Gunshots]

21:39.299 --> 21:40.914
BO: Aaa!

21:47.807 --> 21:48.592
Did they get away?

21:48.850 --> 21:49.839
[Whack!]

21:57.442 --> 21:58.557
We've got a problem.

21:58.818 --> 22:00.228
There's been an
attack by humans.

22:00.487 --> 22:00.816
What?

22:01.070 --> 22:02.321
They've taken Dyson.

22:02.572 --> 22:04.187
HALE: No one leaves until we
know what we're dealing with.

22:04.449 --> 22:06.189
I want this place locked down.

22:07.076 --> 22:10.034
Get the Dark Fae
Elders here pronto.

22:10.288 --> 22:12.779
Shit's about to get real.

22:14.250 --> 22:15.035
[Whack!]

22:15.293 --> 22:16.908
Who were they?
Where'd they take Dyson?

22:17.170 --> 22:19.331
What are you talking about?
Why'd you hit me?

22:19.589 --> 22:20.669
Because you hit the ground

22:20.924 --> 22:22.004
before they pulled
their weapons.

22:22.258 --> 22:24.044
You poured the drinks,
you poisoned Dyson...

22:24.302 --> 22:25.587
I didn't do anything...

22:26.137 --> 22:28.970
Start talking traitor or so help
me first order of The New Ash

22:29.224 --> 22:30.384
will be your execution.

22:30.642 --> 22:31.722
Already on the books, Trick.

22:31.976 --> 22:33.011
Easy! Easy!

22:33.269 --> 22:35.100
He can't tell us anything
with a crushed throat--

22:36.147 --> 22:37.262
No! No!

22:37.524 --> 22:39.560
I'm sorry.

22:39.817 --> 22:41.899
They have my wife.

22:42.153 --> 22:43.893
I had no choice.

22:44.155 --> 22:44.905
BO: Oh... no...

22:45.156 --> 22:47.647
Damn it.

22:47.909 --> 22:48.659
Oh no.

22:48.910 --> 22:49.148
TRICK: We are gonn--

22:49.410 --> 22:51.696
I know what I have to do, Trick!

23:14.227 --> 23:15.433
Trick?

23:15.687 --> 23:17.473
I prefer treats, actually.

23:17.730 --> 23:20.016
That's quite a smack
your owner gave you.

23:20.275 --> 23:21.731
She's not my owner.

23:21.985 --> 23:23.646
Of course, she was
saving your life.

23:23.903 --> 23:25.894
Some people are
crazy about their pets.

23:26.155 --> 23:27.440
I can handle myself.

23:27.699 --> 23:28.814
I'm nobody's pet.

23:29.075 --> 23:31.316
Still, I mean it
can't be easy.

23:31.578 --> 23:33.114
Having to be
saved all the time.

23:33.371 --> 23:36.113
Creating compromise
in difficult situations.

23:36.374 --> 23:38.160
Holding your friends back.

23:39.127 --> 23:41.994
Yeah, it's not easy being the
only human on the attack squad,

23:42.255 --> 23:44.746
but I bring other
things to the table.

23:45.008 --> 23:47.374
What if I told you, you
could bring the real...

23:47.635 --> 23:49.626
thing to the table?

23:49.887 --> 23:50.967
What?

23:51.222 --> 23:53.304
Oh, come on.

23:53.558 --> 23:56.345
Don't pretend that you never
thought about being one of us.

23:58.104 --> 23:59.560
What are you even
doing down here?

23:59.814 --> 24:02.396
You don't know Trick.

24:03.234 --> 24:04.349
I was concerned.

24:06.029 --> 24:07.860
Yeah well, where I'm from,
concern only comes with

24:08.114 --> 24:10.480
a sales pitch if there's
some kind of an angle.

24:10.742 --> 24:11.481
You're a smart girl.

24:11.743 --> 24:13.279
Takes a con to know a con.

24:13.536 --> 24:14.651
So, what do you think?

24:14.912 --> 24:16.994
How did I do? Are you hooked?

24:18.833 --> 24:21.119
I'll just wait for
the movie, thank you.

24:21.377 --> 24:22.878
For now you need to get
the hell out of here

24:23.129 --> 24:23.959
before I scream.

24:24.213 --> 24:26.204
For help?

24:27.258 --> 24:28.589
As you wish.

24:44.567 --> 24:46.558
What are you doing here?

24:48.613 --> 24:53.277
Hey! I was just on the way
to the Dal to meet a friend

24:53.534 --> 24:55.070
and you had said Lauren
was missing, right?

24:55.328 --> 24:56.192
Right.

24:56.454 --> 24:59.161
So I thought I'd put
my cop skills to use,

24:59.415 --> 25:04.500
come over here to see if I
could find some evidence...

25:06.506 --> 25:08.212
Dude, I live in my truck.

25:08.466 --> 25:11.208
Look, I don't care.
Dyson's been kidnapped.

25:11.469 --> 25:12.003
What?

25:12.261 --> 25:14.047
At the Dal. By humans.

25:14.305 --> 25:17.092
How did humans
take down a wolf?

25:18.893 --> 25:20.394
With this.

25:20.645 --> 25:22.636
The Bartender poisoned
him then poisned himself

25:22.897 --> 25:24.603
before I could question him.

25:24.857 --> 25:26.563
Bitch, this better
not be your Lauren.

25:26.818 --> 25:28.274
I'm afraid so.

25:29.737 --> 25:33.070
Well, ain't that just a Shit
Sandwich that eats like a meal.

25:33.324 --> 25:34.655
It gets worse.

25:34.909 --> 25:36.945
The disguise they were using so
they wouldn't be detected by Fae

25:37.203 --> 25:39.319
was the same disguise
Lauren used to fool the warden

25:39.580 --> 25:41.241
when we were in Hecuba Prison.

25:41.499 --> 25:46.459
Wait now, so... one of your
ex's took out the other?

25:47.630 --> 25:50.337
Well, when you say it
like that it sounds weird.

25:51.175 --> 25:52.164
Are you gonna
help me or not?

25:52.427 --> 25:54.634
Look... If the bartender
dropped dead immediately

25:54.887 --> 25:56.878
how do we even know
Dyson's alive?

25:57.140 --> 25:59.005
Because I know, Tamsin.

25:59.267 --> 26:01.679
I don't understand why,
but I can feel it.

26:01.936 --> 26:02.766
She's alive.

26:03.020 --> 26:03.554
Hey...

26:05.231 --> 26:07.438
I'm fine.

26:07.692 --> 26:10.684
Just been having all of my
meals in liquid form lately.

26:10.945 --> 26:12.276
Just need a straightener.

26:12.613 --> 26:14.114
Think you've had enough.

26:14.365 --> 26:15.320
There's some left.

26:15.575 --> 26:16.030
Tamsin...

26:16.284 --> 26:17.273
[Smash!]

26:22.290 --> 26:26.579
Okay, okay.

26:26.836 --> 26:30.704
Just scour the apartment.
If she did really turn on us,

26:30.965 --> 26:32.626
maybe we can find out why.

26:33.593 --> 26:35.754
Dyson still have her phone?

26:36.012 --> 26:39.095
No, he dropped it at the Dal.

26:39.348 --> 26:41.509
There's a number in there
she's been calling lately.

26:41.768 --> 26:43.133
It doesn't ring any bells.

26:44.103 --> 26:46.185
I can run it down
to the Cop Shop.

26:46.439 --> 26:50.352
Have the boys do a trace. See
if I can find out who it is.

26:50.610 --> 26:52.225
[Whispers]
Oh Lauren, no.

26:54.322 --> 26:55.311
Find something?

26:57.033 --> 26:59.149
No, nothing.

27:00.536 --> 27:02.993
I'm gonna get dressed.

27:03.247 --> 27:04.407
You should change that frock.

27:04.665 --> 27:06.826
Things are gonna get dirt-ayy.

27:07.084 --> 27:10.121
Are you sure you're
in fighting shape?

27:10.379 --> 27:12.756
Humans took Dyson.

27:13.007 --> 27:15.214
I've never been
fightier in my life.

27:19.096 --> 27:20.256
Great.

27:20.723 --> 27:23.305
How did the humans even manage
to get past the enchantments

27:23.559 --> 27:24.969
that protect the Dal?

27:25.228 --> 27:26.092
They were helped!

27:26.354 --> 27:28.595
By that human the
Succubus keeps!

27:28.856 --> 27:32.474
No! Kenzi single-handedly
saved Dyson during

27:32.735 --> 27:33.850
the fight with the Garuda.

27:34.111 --> 27:37.103
When all of you were
hiding in your posh homes!

27:37.365 --> 27:38.855
She had nothing
to do with this.

27:39.116 --> 27:40.071
Friends.

27:40.326 --> 27:41.566
Elders.

27:41.828 --> 27:42.943
Noblemen.

27:43.204 --> 27:44.819
Shut the hell up and listen.

27:45.081 --> 27:48.994
Hale and I have been
trying to broker a peace.

27:49.252 --> 27:51.664
We've been trying to
find a way to get the Light

27:51.921 --> 27:54.913
and the Dark to work
together for a common good.

27:55.174 --> 27:59.759
Well the need for such an
alliance has finally come.

28:00.012 --> 28:01.218
But not with him!

28:01.472 --> 28:01.756
[Applause]

28:02.014 --> 28:05.051
Too long have bleeding hearts
like him stood by and watched

28:05.309 --> 28:09.348
humans believe that they are the
superior beings on the planet,

28:09.605 --> 28:12.688
so much so that they've had
the hubris to plan an attack

28:12.942 --> 28:17.026
against the one true race...
on our own turf!

28:17.280 --> 28:18.565
And get away with it.

28:18.823 --> 28:19.733
[Applause]

28:19.991 --> 28:22.573
His leadership allowed
this attack to happen!

28:22.827 --> 28:24.317
That is completely unfounded!

28:24.579 --> 28:25.568
Oh?

28:25.830 --> 28:27.320
Is it really?

28:33.838 --> 28:34.953
Where did you get this?

28:35.214 --> 28:37.705
Read the label out loud
so we can all hear.

28:37.967 --> 28:40.458
Let's see who
supplied the poison

28:40.720 --> 28:43.336
that took a proud Fae down.

28:43.598 --> 28:45.054
You don't want to do this.

28:45.308 --> 28:46.468
Read it.

28:50.271 --> 28:51.886
HALE: Dr. Lauren Lewis.

28:52.148 --> 28:55.015
His own chief medical officer.

28:55.276 --> 28:59.110
I call for a vote of no
confidence in this fake Ash!

28:59.363 --> 29:01.615
[Loud applause]

29:16.213 --> 29:19.341
[Mechanical voice]
I applaud your strength, wolf.

29:19.592 --> 29:22.083
You were given the antidote
a full thirty minutes after the

29:22.345 --> 29:23.801
neurotoxin was ingested.

29:24.055 --> 29:26.216
You're even stronger
than I had hoped.

29:26.474 --> 29:27.179
Why don't you
come down here,

29:27.433 --> 29:29.389
and I'll show you how
strong I can really be?

29:29.644 --> 29:32.727
[Evil chuckle]

29:32.980 --> 29:34.686
No, thank you,
we'll meet soon enough.

29:34.941 --> 29:36.101
What do you want with me?

29:36.359 --> 29:40.944
I want you
to prove your worth.

29:41.197 --> 29:43.779
Against your mortal enemy.

29:44.033 --> 29:47.241
I would put the odds
at even I should think.

29:50.790 --> 29:52.030
Lupercus.

29:54.335 --> 29:56.747
Whattaya say you and I forget
about thousands of years

29:57.004 --> 29:59.746
of hatred between
your kind and mine

30:00.007 --> 30:02.214
try to find a way out
of here together?

30:03.177 --> 30:05.418
[G rowls]

30:08.432 --> 30:09.547
Have it your way.

30:09.809 --> 30:13.802
[Fierce growling]

30:25.366 --> 30:28.779
[Growling and fighting]

30:39.839 --> 30:40.624
BO: You sure that's right?

30:40.881 --> 30:42.337
There's not much in
that part of town.

30:42.591 --> 30:43.501
TAMSIN: Yeah, well...

30:43.759 --> 30:45.545
It wasn't easy to trace,
believe me, but my guy said

30:45.803 --> 30:47.885
that the cell phone was
using towers just north

30:48.139 --> 30:49.800
of this compound...
Shit.

30:50.057 --> 30:51.638
What now?

30:51.892 --> 30:55.225
I got it. Get your ass in the
truck. I won't be a minute.

31:04.530 --> 31:06.236
Okay.

31:28.054 --> 31:28.918
Trick?

31:29.847 --> 31:31.212
Kenzi?

31:32.850 --> 31:33.965
What are you
still doing here?

31:34.226 --> 31:35.511
You need to leave.

31:35.770 --> 31:36.475
Trick look I--

31:36.729 --> 31:38.060
Go home.

31:38.314 --> 31:39.394
Hide.

31:39.648 --> 31:41.900
When the dust settles I'll
come fine you. I promise.

31:42.151 --> 31:43.687
But you have to go!

31:46.781 --> 31:50.820
[Cell ringtone]

31:51.077 --> 31:52.362
Bo.

31:52.620 --> 31:55.111
Kenzi, I sent you a photo. I need
you to find out what it means.

31:55.372 --> 31:57.579
Yeah, things have gone
all Tyra back here, babe.

31:57.833 --> 31:59.619
The Morrigan is talking
smack about claimed humans

31:59.877 --> 32:01.959
being criminals, there's
this vote against Hale,

32:02.213 --> 32:04.420
and they found this thing
with Lauren's name on it--

32:04.673 --> 32:05.628
Oh shit!

32:05.883 --> 32:07.839
Okay, Kenzi, I need you
to get out of there.

32:08.094 --> 32:09.209
Just go somewhere, anywhere.

32:09.470 --> 32:11.552
Okay, promise,
promise, promise.

32:13.849 --> 32:15.009
Sucker.

32:25.402 --> 32:27.358
I've seen one
of those before.

32:27.613 --> 32:28.898
Man, why are you still here?

32:29.156 --> 32:31.192
Because you are.

32:31.450 --> 32:34.942
Yeah, well it seems every Fae
and their dog want me gone so,

32:35.204 --> 32:36.660
toodle-loo, Wank-head.

32:36.914 --> 32:39.075
Who are the Fae
to tell you to leave?

32:39.333 --> 32:44.453
Especially after everything
you have done for them?

32:44.713 --> 32:47.090
You don't know
anything about me.

32:47.341 --> 32:50.424
I know you saved that
Wolf, more than once.

32:50.678 --> 32:52.760
I know you stared a
Cherufe in the eye

32:53.013 --> 32:54.139
and lived to tell the tale.

32:54.390 --> 32:57.132
I know that isn't fair that
they try to push you out

32:57.393 --> 32:59.884
when they can only claim to
be better than you because

33:00.146 --> 33:03.604
they were lucky enough to be
born with exceptional gifts.

33:03.858 --> 33:06.895
See you... You don't
have any of those gifts,

33:07.153 --> 33:08.984
yet you still fight.

33:11.157 --> 33:11.987
Anyway,

33:12.241 --> 33:15.278
I'm interrupting you,
you gotta go.

33:18.914 --> 33:20.450
Wait.

33:25.296 --> 33:27.036
I don't trust you, okay.

33:27.298 --> 33:29.084
But my best
friend is in trouble.

33:29.341 --> 33:32.879
You want to help me? You want
to give me what I desire?

33:33.137 --> 33:35.219
Then tell me what this vial is.

33:35.931 --> 33:37.842
Sure, but there's a price.

33:38.100 --> 33:38.338
Name it.

33:38.601 --> 33:39.841
A kiss.

33:40.102 --> 33:43.390
Hero to dick in like six
sentences you are unbelievable.

33:43.647 --> 33:44.853
It isn't like that.

33:45.107 --> 33:47.564
This kind of information
requires this kind of tribute.

33:47.818 --> 33:49.274
I don't make the rules.

33:51.405 --> 33:53.145
Fine.

34:07.213 --> 34:09.374
What the hell was that?

34:09.632 --> 34:10.997
That?

34:11.258 --> 34:13.249
That was something.

34:16.305 --> 34:17.465
Hello!

34:17.723 --> 34:18.838
Forget much?

34:19.099 --> 34:20.179
You want the right information

34:20.434 --> 34:23.096
or the almost right information?

34:23.354 --> 34:24.309
The right.

34:24.563 --> 34:26.519
Then I'm gonna need
a couple of minutes.

34:33.572 --> 34:37.815
[Growling and fighting]

34:47.127 --> 34:49.743
[Evil chuckle]

34:50.005 --> 34:55.591
[Growling and fighting]

35:00.391 --> 35:02.848
[Evil chuckle]

35:05.020 --> 35:06.931
Is that what you want?

35:07.189 --> 35:08.929
You're the one I want.

35:09.191 --> 35:09.725
I knew it.

35:09.984 --> 35:11.474
I knew you were the one.

35:20.744 --> 35:23.076
This is bad. I've seen
this kind of thing before.

35:23.330 --> 35:25.412
And it is not gonna
end well for humans.

35:25.666 --> 35:27.031
It's gonna get
bloody before better.

35:27.293 --> 35:28.999
If I were you,
I'd get outta town.

35:29.253 --> 35:31.164
What? What are
you talking about?

35:31.422 --> 35:32.878
Those guys guarding
whatever that place is

35:33.132 --> 35:34.838
look like the guys
that took Dyson.

35:35.092 --> 35:35.717
And Lauren is missing...

35:35.968 --> 35:36.923
Lauren is as good as dead.

35:37.177 --> 35:38.087
No way.

35:41.557 --> 35:42.842
No!

35:43.100 --> 35:45.682
They need me. They are my
friends. I am not leaving.

35:45.936 --> 35:47.346
Why do you care so much?

35:47.604 --> 35:50.186
Tamsin, what is
going on with you?

35:50.441 --> 35:50.805
Watch out!

35:51.066 --> 35:52.226
[Gunshot]

35:53.944 --> 35:56.151
[Breathing heavily in pain]

35:57.072 --> 35:59.688
Are you sure you
wanna do that, buddy?

36:00.117 --> 36:03.655
Huh? I don't think that
those were your orders.

36:06.290 --> 36:07.496
[Whack!]

36:09.043 --> 36:12.706
This is the last time I do
anything nice for you.

36:14.131 --> 36:15.291
No!

36:17.551 --> 36:19.963
Now the for has 26 in favour.

36:20.220 --> 36:22.427
13 against.

36:22.681 --> 36:25.013
The Morrigan's motion is passed.

36:25.267 --> 36:27.974
[Applause]

36:28.228 --> 36:30.355
From this day
forward all humans,

36:30.606 --> 36:33.439
claimed or under
the employ of the Fae,

36:33.692 --> 36:37.025
in this territory will be
considered terrorists.

36:37.279 --> 36:39.861
Enemies of the One True State.

36:40.115 --> 36:44.825
[Applause]

36:45.496 --> 36:47.862
Whoever had that photo
in the bag with the vial

36:48.123 --> 36:49.238
is trying to
imprison your friend.

36:49.500 --> 36:50.330
Why?

36:50.584 --> 36:52.825
To enslave her,
to kill her maybe,

36:53.087 --> 36:53.576
I don't know really.

36:53.837 --> 36:55.498
HALE: What are you
still doing here?

36:55.756 --> 36:56.586
Look Bo's in trouble.

36:56.840 --> 36:57.955
I think Tamsin's
trying to hurt her.

36:58.217 --> 37:00.299
HALE: Forget Bo for a
second. You have to go--

37:00.552 --> 37:03.009
Stop saying that to me!

37:03.263 --> 37:05.800
Why does everyone
keep saying that!

37:06.058 --> 37:07.468
We all used to be
friends, Hale!

37:07.726 --> 37:08.226
Goddamn it Kenzi!

37:08.477 --> 37:09.557
You are not my friend.

37:09.812 --> 37:11.723
You've never been just a friend.

37:15.067 --> 37:17.433
If anything happens to you...

37:17.694 --> 37:18.854
I won't be any
good to anyone.

37:19.113 --> 37:23.026
And right now I need to be
better than I've ever been.

37:23.283 --> 37:24.989
Asshole.

37:25.244 --> 37:28.828
Stupid... Why
didn't you tell me that?

37:29.081 --> 37:32.164
Because I was scared.

37:32.418 --> 37:33.453
You have to go!

37:33.710 --> 37:35.701
Saying your good-byes?

37:36.422 --> 37:37.753
Something like that.

37:38.507 --> 37:41.499
Uh, it's okay, I got this one.

37:44.096 --> 37:44.960
Hale?

37:45.222 --> 37:46.007
What are you doing?

37:46.265 --> 37:46.549
Kenzi--

37:46.807 --> 37:48.013
Let go of me!

37:48.267 --> 37:50.929
Claimed human of Bo,
the unaligned Succubus.

37:51.186 --> 37:55.099
From this day forth you will be
known as an enemy of the state.

37:55.357 --> 37:57.769
And will be immediately put
under guard until such time

37:58.026 --> 38:00.563
you are provided with
a date of execution.

38:00.821 --> 38:02.186
Execution?

38:09.997 --> 38:11.032
Mmmm.

38:13.041 --> 38:15.373
I always wondered what
a terrorist tasted like!

38:15.627 --> 38:17.208
Take her away.

38:57.753 --> 38:58.583
Trick?

38:58.837 --> 39:01.249
Trick!

39:05.385 --> 39:06.636
Trick?

39:17.272 --> 39:18.227
Come on babe, wake up!

39:18.482 --> 39:19.517
Wake up!

39:20.108 --> 39:21.484
Oh God.

39:22.486 --> 39:29.358
[Phone ringing]

39:30.410 --> 39:31.195
I'm busy. What?

39:31.453 --> 39:31.987
Hello, Blondie.

39:32.246 --> 39:34.077
It's the Druid. Just
thought you'd like to know.

39:34.331 --> 39:36.367
I've secured the kiss
from the best friend.

39:36.625 --> 39:38.911
The Serum to tame
the Succubus is ready.

39:39.169 --> 39:39.624
Great.

39:39.878 --> 39:41.084
I'll be in touch.

39:42.756 --> 39:44.667
Oh Tamsin.

39:44.925 --> 39:46.711
Oh, you stupid, stupid girl.

39:56.353 --> 39:58.014
Lauren?!

40:02.067 --> 40:03.682
Dyson. Oh, my god.

40:03.944 --> 40:05.935
I don't suppose you're
part of a rousing rescue?

40:06.196 --> 40:07.572
What happened to you?

40:07.823 --> 40:12.192
I was drugged and
I woke up, I was fighting...

40:12.452 --> 40:13.612
What are you doing here?

40:13.870 --> 40:15.781
Dyson listen to me...

40:16.039 --> 40:17.620
There's a sample
in the Lab upstairs.

40:17.874 --> 40:20.286
An enzyme from
a mature Succubus...

40:20.544 --> 40:22.455
Her immune system...

40:22.713 --> 40:23.748
Is Bo here...?

40:24.006 --> 40:24.995
Who's Bo?

40:27.467 --> 40:28.422
How do I meet this Bo?

40:28.677 --> 40:30.508
Do you have any idea what
you are meddling with?

40:30.762 --> 40:32.753
Do you have any idea
what you're meddling with?

40:36.018 --> 40:38.054
It wasn't supposed to be
like this. I wanted to tell you.

40:38.312 --> 40:39.722
Do you have any idea how
long I've been planning?

40:40.564 --> 40:42.555
ISAAC: Since I was a kid,

40:42.816 --> 40:43.931
forty years they've
been laughing at me.

40:44.192 --> 40:46.649
Forty years, you have
any idea how gratifying

40:46.903 --> 40:48.518
this is gonna be.

40:48.780 --> 40:52.022
LAUREN: You used my
research to poison my friend.

40:52.284 --> 40:53.364
You lied to me.

40:53.619 --> 40:55.701
It was not your research.
It was not your research!

40:55.954 --> 40:57.910
It was my research.

41:00.334 --> 41:02.916
But yeah, you're right,
that's fair. I used you.

41:03.170 --> 41:04.205
I'll continue using you.

41:04.463 --> 41:05.794
[Bam!]

41:06.089 --> 41:08.000
That was your mass grave!

41:08.258 --> 41:10.123
You're the one
that's hunting us!

41:10.385 --> 41:12.922
My goodness he's
magnificient, isn't he?

41:13.180 --> 41:15.887
You're magnificient.
I can't wait to be like you.

41:16.141 --> 41:18.678
It's gonna be fun.
It's gonna be fun.

41:22.898 --> 41:28.393
I really want you to understand
how important our work...

41:30.072 --> 41:31.903
...is going to be.

41:37.204 --> 41:44.326
Hey, we're gonna do great
things together, you and I.

41:45.087 --> 41:46.793
Lauren...

41:47.422 --> 41:49.037
I never lied to
you about that.

42:09.695 --> 42:12.061
No, no. No!

42:12.531 --> 42:14.067
You don't really
know who I am.

42:14.324 --> 42:15.439
You're making a big mistake!

42:26.044 --> 42:27.204
Dyson?

42:29.256 --> 42:30.496
Dyson .

42:30.757 --> 42:32.918
I'm so sorry.

42:33.176 --> 42:35.588
I had no idea.

42:35.846 --> 42:39.839
He's been hunting us...
torturing us.

42:40.100 --> 42:41.681
Making us fight
each other like dogs.

42:41.935 --> 42:42.469
I didn't know...

42:42.728 --> 42:44.593
Hale told you not to go!

42:44.855 --> 42:47.016
He lied to me...

42:47.274 --> 42:50.437
This is why you can't
leave the Fae, Lauren.

42:50.694 --> 42:53.060
Why you can never leave.

42:53.739 --> 42:54.899
Have you seen
my husband?

42:55.157 --> 42:56.146
They took him.

42:56.992 --> 42:59.358
I'm sorry, I don't know
who you are talking about.

42:59.619 --> 43:01.530
Jerry, his name is Jerry.

43:01.788 --> 43:03.870
They said they would
kill me if he didn't do it.

43:04.124 --> 43:06.035
If he didn't do what?

43:06.293 --> 43:07.783
This.

43:08.044 --> 43:09.295
To me.

43:10.380 --> 43:13.964
He did fine, trust me.

43:14.217 --> 43:15.593
Looks like you're gonna live.

43:15.844 --> 43:19.007
What about my daughter?
Is she safe?

43:19.264 --> 43:20.800
My daughter...

43:21.057 --> 43:24.424
Where? My daughter?

43:26.438 --> 43:27.803
Aifa?!

43:29.316 --> 43:31.307
My daughter.
