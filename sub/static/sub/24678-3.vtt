Narrator:
In New York City war on crime,

00:08.175 --> 00:11.782
the worst criminal offenders
are pursued by the detectives

00:11.812 --> 00:13.519
of the Major Case Squad.

00:13.547 --> 00:15.390
These are their stories.

00:17.484 --> 00:20.328
Come on, it's just for one night.

00:20.354 --> 00:22.061
It's $1,000 and no sex.

00:22.089 --> 00:24.592
You just take him to the club,
show him the town.

00:24.625 --> 00:26.969
I've never done this.

00:26.994 --> 00:30.168
And Dale and I are starting a new life.

00:30.197 --> 00:31.437
We're getting married.

00:31.465 --> 00:33.274
So use the money for your honeymoon.

00:34.501 --> 00:36.105
What do you think?

00:36.136 --> 00:39.345
Two big shots-- two men of means
want you to show you them the town?

00:39.373 --> 00:41.853
They're really nice guys. I promise.

00:41.875 --> 00:44.947
Okay? Tomorrow we meet here,

00:44.978 --> 00:47.584
and then we hook up with
the guys at the hotel.

00:47.614 --> 00:49.423
Okay?

00:51.084 --> 00:54.122
Okay, I'll see you.

01:00.360 --> 01:03.500
- I don't like her.
- She's doing us a favor.

01:03.530 --> 01:06.170
Yeah, but we don't need
to get married right now.

01:07.534 --> 01:09.605
We can wait till we're totally clean

01:09.636 --> 01:12.116
and we got jobs.

01:12.139 --> 01:15.052
People who feel the way
we feel about each other

01:15.075 --> 01:18.352
should be married, you know?

01:18.378 --> 01:21.723
I'm going to go do this thing with Becky.

01:22.849 --> 01:24.795
It'll be fine.

01:30.791 --> 01:34.705
Lois, why don't you have something?

01:34.728 --> 01:36.765
She's not drinking, Billy.

01:36.797 --> 01:39.277
What, she's on the wagon?

01:39.299 --> 01:42.974
No, I've just never been much of a drinker.

01:43.003 --> 01:46.314
Mmm, stupid me.

01:46.340 --> 01:48.081
I know what she needs.

01:48.108 --> 01:50.486
No, no, I don't.

01:50.510 --> 01:52.353
Not anymore.

01:56.883 --> 01:59.659
We're going out anyways to dinner, right?

01:59.686 --> 02:01.324
- ( cell phone rings )
- Oh, sorry.

02:01.355 --> 02:02.959
I forgot to turn it off.

02:04.424 --> 02:06.062
Yeah?

02:06.093 --> 02:08.402
Oh. Here, it's Dale.

02:12.366 --> 02:15.313
Hi, baby.

02:15.335 --> 02:18.043
They're creepy.

02:18.071 --> 02:21.177
Like a couple of ex-cons...

02:21.208 --> 02:23.210
In brand new suits.

02:23.243 --> 02:25.223
One of them's still got a tag

02:25.245 --> 02:29.352
from the designer warehouse
still stuck on his sleeve.

02:32.019 --> 02:35.000
I don't have a good feeling
about this. Can you come and get me?

02:35.022 --> 02:37.400
With what? I spent it.

02:37.424 --> 02:40.462
I tried. She won't even answer the phone.

02:40.494 --> 02:41.871
Can't you just walk out?

02:43.163 --> 02:46.440
All right, I'll be there.

02:46.466 --> 02:47.968
Just don't leave, okay?

02:50.937 --> 02:53.918
I really need to borrow this money.

02:54.908 --> 02:56.945
I loan you money, your mother'll kill me.

02:56.977 --> 02:58.718
She won't even know.

02:58.745 --> 03:01.851
Cab fare, $20 bucks. Please.

03:03.417 --> 03:06.159
- Cab fare?
- I swear to God.

03:08.689 --> 03:11.295
Come on, they want to go to dinner already.

03:13.160 --> 03:14.730
I wanted to fix my hair.

03:14.761 --> 03:18.208
- You look good.
- (screaming)

03:18.231 --> 03:21.041
Man: Grab her feet! Grab her feet!

03:21.068 --> 03:24.379
( sobbing )

03:26.339 --> 03:28.478
( theme music playing )

03:30.000 --> 03:36.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:14.254 --> 04:17.827
Last guest was a Belgian diplomat, 4 days ago.

04:17.858 --> 04:20.361
Jibes with the decomposition.

04:20.392 --> 04:22.532
Jacket button.

04:24.231 --> 04:26.370
Strangulation marks-- big ones.

04:26.399 --> 04:28.345
Belt probably.

04:29.369 --> 04:31.781
They stuffed her in the box spring

04:31.805 --> 04:33.876
and put the mattress over her.

04:37.010 --> 04:40.116
Defensive wounds on the hands.

04:40.147 --> 04:42.855
Looks like she fought the good fight.

04:42.883 --> 04:46.126
Track marks. She might be
in the system for a dope pop.

04:46.153 --> 04:50.124
Check out her fingers. Her prints
were burned off with acid.

04:50.157 --> 04:52.364
Poor woman.

04:52.392 --> 04:55.168
A broken toe.

04:55.195 --> 04:56.765
Maybe from kicking the perp.

05:02.702 --> 05:04.045
What is that?

05:07.307 --> 05:10.845
- Fish scale.
- Great, she was attacked by a shark.

05:10.877 --> 05:13.323
Sharks don't have scales.

05:14.314 --> 05:15.987
(sighs)

05:19.186 --> 05:21.723
This is ridiculous. I've
never seen this woman.

05:21.755 --> 05:25.293
Your consulate said you have an apartment
in town, so why rent a hotel room?

05:25.325 --> 05:27.066
My wife and I have an arrangement.

05:27.093 --> 05:29.164
In any event, I left the hotel at 11:00.

05:29.196 --> 05:31.972
What kind of an arrangement with your wife?

05:31.998 --> 05:33.443
None of your business.

05:35.001 --> 05:36.912
- What happened in Bangkok?
- Bangkok?

05:36.937 --> 05:38.917
That's another thing your consulate told us.

05:38.939 --> 05:41.647
You were transferred after spending
nine months in Bangkok?

05:41.675 --> 05:44.087
I'm a Belgian citizen, employed by
the Belgian consulate.

05:44.110 --> 05:48.320
I have diplomatic status.
You can talk to our lawyers. Goodbye.

05:50.016 --> 05:51.825
The arrangement he has with his wife is

05:51.852 --> 05:53.889
he gets to be a bad boy once a month,

05:53.920 --> 05:56.833
but then he has to tell her what he did.

05:56.857 --> 05:59.303
Oh, those wacky Belgians.

05:59.326 --> 06:01.806
- She confirm what time he got home?
- 11:00.

06:01.828 --> 06:05.366
We faxed the police in Bangkok
to get a line on his twist.

06:05.398 --> 06:07.400
Any luck getting a line on the Jane Doe?

06:07.434 --> 06:10.074
Her bridgework has serial numbers
meaning prison issue,

06:10.103 --> 06:12.140
but it doesn't match anything in our system.

06:12.172 --> 06:13.981
So she was in a facility out of state.

06:14.007 --> 06:15.918
Start sending the serial numbers around.

06:15.942 --> 06:17.387
What else?

06:17.410 --> 06:19.412
Sawdust and fish scales in her stockings.

06:19.446 --> 06:21.551
Might've been in a fish market.

06:21.581 --> 06:23.959
You want to canvass fish markets, be my guest.

06:23.984 --> 06:25.622
You get a tox report?

06:25.652 --> 06:27.962
Track marks on her arms were old,

06:27.988 --> 06:31.299
but she tested positive for crack--
very small concentration.

06:31.324 --> 06:33.668
ME thinks she hadn't used
in at least a couple weeks.

06:33.693 --> 06:35.934
She also tested positive for lithium.

06:35.962 --> 06:37.498
It might've been for depression.

06:37.530 --> 06:40.101
What's so depressing
about being a crack whore?

06:40.133 --> 06:42.807
Pregnant crack whore-- eight weeks.

06:42.836 --> 06:45.077
Could be why she went off the
dope-- to clean up.

06:45.105 --> 06:47.881
This diplomat, any idea where he
hooked up with our victim?

06:47.908 --> 06:49.819
We're checking his credit card receipts.

06:49.843 --> 06:52.653
Good, put him together
with her Thursday night, we got him.

06:55.682 --> 06:57.958
Man: I don't know hen But this guy,

06:57.984 --> 07:00.760
he was here Thursday night.
Big mouthed Belgian--

07:00.787 --> 07:02.323
comes in once a month.

07:02.355 --> 07:05.700
Gets a snootful, starts bragging
about how many women he's had.

07:05.725 --> 07:07.500
He leave with anybody?

07:07.527 --> 07:08.835
Brunette named Becky.

07:08.862 --> 07:12.400
A pro. Comes in a couple times
a month. They left around 8:00.

07:12.432 --> 07:13.877
How do we find Becky?

07:13.900 --> 07:16.244
I'm sorry, I'm not a close personal friend.

07:18.104 --> 07:19.811
But try him.

07:26.513 --> 07:28.754
How you doing?

07:28.782 --> 07:31.262
We're looking for a girl named Becky.

07:31.284 --> 07:33.787
I'm just here to meet a business associate.

07:33.820 --> 07:36.300
- That your money?
- Yes.

07:36.323 --> 07:39.497
Paying cash so the wife doesn't
catch it on the credit card bill?

07:39.526 --> 07:41.369
Wife?

07:41.394 --> 07:42.805
The one that gave you the ring

07:42.829 --> 07:45.002
that left a tan line on your finger.

07:47.867 --> 07:49.847
We're not here to bust you.

07:49.869 --> 07:51.940
We just need to find Becky.

07:53.239 --> 07:55.219
I haven't seen her for a couple of months.

07:55.241 --> 07:57.619
- I don't have her number,
- She have a favorite hotel?

07:57.644 --> 08:01.649
No, we go in my car. I find
a spot, drop her off.

08:01.681 --> 08:04.525
- Where?
- Near the seaport.

08:04.551 --> 08:06.053
There's some bars.

08:06.086 --> 08:09.863
Thank you. Enjoy your evening.

08:11.992 --> 08:14.836
The sawdust and fish scales
on that girl's feet?

08:14.861 --> 08:19.401
Shannon's Bar. The guys from the Fulton
Fish Market go there after work.

08:19.432 --> 08:22.072
Becky? She was here last Thursday.

08:22.102 --> 08:23.911
With a little girl named Lois.

08:25.438 --> 08:26.883
Lois?

08:26.906 --> 08:29.944
Yeah. Jeez, mate.

08:29.976 --> 08:32.751
- What'd they do to her?
- That's what we want to talk to Becky about.

08:32.779 --> 08:37.922
Oh, Becky's Jack Daniels straight up and a
good time. That's all I know about her.

08:37.951 --> 08:41.193
- And Lois?
- She was just here twice with Becky--

08:41.221 --> 08:45.431
on that Thursday... and the night before.
She had a fellow with her.

08:47.894 --> 08:50.966
- A Belgian guy?
- No. Not him.

08:50.997 --> 08:54.171
Somebody more like her.
You know, scruffy sort.

08:54.200 --> 08:56.680
So Thursday,

08:56.703 --> 08:59.013
what time were Becky and Lois in here?

08:59.039 --> 09:01.485
First Lois was here for a bit.

09:01.508 --> 09:03.715
Then Becky dropped by

09:03.743 --> 09:05.780
and they left together around midnight.

09:05.812 --> 09:08.691
An hour after Mr. Belgium
went home to his missus.

09:12.485 --> 09:14.624
You could've made it $21 grand.

09:14.654 --> 09:17.294
$20 grand's going to be hard
splitting three ways.

09:17.323 --> 09:19.530
- Are you complaining?
- No.

09:20.560 --> 09:23.837
- Sorry.
- This concludes our business.

09:24.831 --> 09:27.004
You're not going to come
watch me dance no more?

09:27.033 --> 09:29.206
No, I don't know you.

09:29.235 --> 09:31.647
You don't know me.

09:33.606 --> 09:35.517
Remind your friends.

09:37.110 --> 09:40.523
You do remember everything I told you?

09:44.517 --> 09:47.327
Anywhere, anytime.

09:54.360 --> 09:56.499
Our Belgian friend picks up Becky at 8:00,

09:56.529 --> 09:59.100
takes her to the hotel at 11:00, he goes home.

09:59.132 --> 10:00.805
Becky keeps the hotel room,

10:00.834 --> 10:03.678
she picks up Lois at Shannon's Bar at 12:00.

10:03.703 --> 10:06.809
They head back to the hotel
to turn over some extra business.

10:06.840 --> 10:08.683
One of the Johns gets too frisky.

10:08.708 --> 10:10.847
Or Becky and Lois got in a fight over money.

10:10.877 --> 10:13.517
We got an answer back from Florida
on Lois' dental work.

10:13.546 --> 10:16.186
She's one of theirs. Lois Romney.

10:16.216 --> 10:18.890
36, two years for possession,

10:18.918 --> 10:20.829
went to beauty school in prison.

10:20.854 --> 10:24.495
Here she did 90 days at Rikers
last year for shoplifting.

10:24.524 --> 10:26.526
You got a "last known" in there?

10:29.996 --> 10:32.476
Not your usual junkie hell-hole.

10:32.499 --> 10:34.911
She was making an effort.

10:36.736 --> 10:39.512
Someone's been through here--
took down some photos.

10:39.539 --> 10:41.985
A pair of men's shoes.

10:53.286 --> 10:56.199
Paycheck stubs from a beauty salon.

11:00.460 --> 11:02.497
The last one's from six months ago.

11:02.529 --> 11:04.668
Look at these.

11:04.697 --> 11:07.041
Sterling silver.

11:09.102 --> 11:11.309
"Lance Van Acker,

11:11.337 --> 11:16.082
first place Westfield Horse Show,
June 20th, 1960."

11:16.109 --> 11:18.851
Van Ackers. Shipping, airlines.

11:18.878 --> 11:21.324
Oh, those Van Ackers.

11:24.017 --> 11:27.794
Oh, Mrs. Van Acker, these detectives
have been waiting to talk to you.

11:27.820 --> 11:29.527
Yes, about what?

11:29.556 --> 11:33.299
- I'm Detective Eames, this
is Detective Goren.
- Yes?

11:33.326 --> 11:35.237
During the course of an investigation,

11:35.261 --> 11:39.266
we found what seem to be some pieces
of silver belonging to your family.

11:39.299 --> 11:41.779
This plate has an inscription on it.

11:41.801 --> 11:43.906
Yes, to my father.

11:43.937 --> 11:46.850
Good Lord, I didn't know they were missing.

11:46.873 --> 11:49.319
They were in the summerhouse.
Where did you find these?

11:49.342 --> 11:51.253
In the home of a woman who was murdered.

11:51.277 --> 11:55.054
Has this woman ever worked for you?
Her name was Lois Romney.

11:55.081 --> 11:57.118
Dear God!

11:57.150 --> 11:59.130
It looks like--

12:00.620 --> 12:03.464
yes, it's her.

12:03.489 --> 12:05.696
It's my son's fiancé©.

12:11.664 --> 12:14.110
She was pregnant? I didn't know.

12:14.133 --> 12:16.340
I haven't talked to my son in months.

12:16.369 --> 12:18.280
God, I hope he's all right.

12:18.304 --> 12:21.148
Not talking-- your choice or his?

12:21.174 --> 12:23.154
Dale knew he had to meet certain conditions

12:23.176 --> 12:24.849
before I had any contact with him.

12:24.877 --> 12:26.686
What conditions?

12:26.713 --> 12:28.989
His involvement with drugs had to stop.

12:29.015 --> 12:31.120
What about his involvement with Lois Romney?

12:31.150 --> 12:32.993
He knew I didn't approve.

12:33.019 --> 12:35.465
As long as he was with her,
he'd get nothing from me.

12:35.488 --> 12:37.525
- Nothing as in money?
- I had to be strict.

12:37.557 --> 12:40.003
It was all her fault, really.

12:40.026 --> 12:43.530
Dale spent 15 years in and out of rehab.

12:43.563 --> 12:45.509
He'd been off drugs for six months.

12:45.531 --> 12:47.533
I really thought he was going to make it.

12:47.567 --> 12:50.878
Then that woman came along
and he "picked up", as they say.

12:50.903 --> 12:52.849
- Is this him?
- Yes.

12:52.872 --> 12:55.182
He was very athletic when he was young.

12:55.208 --> 12:57.085
Priscilla, we should-- oh, I'm sorry.

12:57.110 --> 12:59.989
- I didn't realize we had guests.
- They're detectives.

13:00.013 --> 13:01.924
Dale's friend Lois has been found dead.

13:01.948 --> 13:03.586
Murdered-- in a hotel room.

13:04.784 --> 13:06.957
Oh, God.

13:06.986 --> 13:10.160
- How's Dale taking it?
- We won't know until we find him.

13:10.189 --> 13:12.499
My husband still speaks
to him from time to time.

13:13.493 --> 13:15.700
But it's been a few weeks.

13:15.728 --> 13:17.605
He ever mention a woman named Becky?

13:17.630 --> 13:21.271
No. No, our conversations
weren't about his friends.

13:21.301 --> 13:25.272
He'd be your stepson, is that right?

13:26.272 --> 13:27.615
Does it show?

13:27.640 --> 13:29.984
Yeah.

13:30.009 --> 13:32.717
Would you mind if we borrowed a photo?

13:32.745 --> 13:35.954
No. You can take that one
if you like. But I want it back.

13:35.982 --> 13:39.623
- We should dress. We'll be late.
- Oh, yes.

13:39.652 --> 13:42.690
It's my husband's Andover reunion
at the Yale Club.

13:42.722 --> 13:44.429
He thinks George W.'s coming.

13:44.457 --> 13:47.631
You wouldn't want to get stuck in traffic.

13:49.729 --> 13:51.470
If sonny gets rid of the girlfriend,

13:51.497 --> 13:53.443
he can get back on the gravy train.

13:53.466 --> 13:55.810
Being pregnant, she
wouldn't want to go easy.

14:02.909 --> 14:04.650
Excuse me,

14:04.677 --> 14:08.819
have you seen Mrs. Van Acker's
son lately-- Dale?

14:08.848 --> 14:12.295
Last Thursday night around 1:30.

14:12.318 --> 14:15.993
- Did he go upstairs?
- No. He knows better.

14:16.022 --> 14:18.969
I let him use the phone here
to talk to his girlfriend.

14:18.991 --> 14:20.902
Then he needed money for a cab.

14:20.927 --> 14:23.669
You're a nice guy. You helped him out.

14:23.696 --> 14:26.973
I slipped him a $20. I'm not supposed
to because of his drugs.

14:26.999 --> 14:29.843
But I made sure he really took a cab.

14:33.339 --> 14:35.080
Becky: I got a ride. Billy's coming.

14:35.108 --> 14:37.486
Woman: Okay, see you tomorrow.

14:50.823 --> 14:52.393
Too late. Show's over.

14:54.494 --> 14:56.599
( screaming )

15:00.800 --> 15:02.837
You and the other two,

15:02.869 --> 15:05.110
I want you out of town.

15:06.239 --> 15:08.810
( sobbing )

15:16.983 --> 15:20.192
These detectives showed me a picture
of a man in the neighborhood.

15:20.219 --> 15:23.530
I thought he looked like the guy you
had a problem with a few days ago.

15:23.556 --> 15:26.127
That's him-- the bum.

15:26.159 --> 15:27.968
He has no money for his laundry,

15:27.994 --> 15:30.270
so he goes out and comes back
with a steel pipe.

15:30.296 --> 15:33.209
He starts whacking my change machines.
So I chased him away.

15:33.232 --> 15:35.371
He ran off toward Coleman
Park near the bridge.

15:35.401 --> 15:38.507
- He leave his clothes behind?
- Yeah, I keep them for the Goodwill.

15:47.547 --> 15:48.992
Uh.

15:51.250 --> 15:53.696
- Should I ask?
- It's sewer grease.

15:54.987 --> 15:57.991
Looks like our boy's been
climbing down manholes.

15:58.024 --> 16:00.698
He likes caves, along with all the other rats.

16:02.161 --> 16:05.631
Tunnels under the bridge.

16:05.665 --> 16:09.238
You can get to them through
the manholes near the park.

16:12.071 --> 16:15.018
It took you long enough.
I'm catching a cold out here.

16:15.041 --> 16:17.112
I had to take the train from Brooklyn.

16:17.143 --> 16:19.145
I'm living in a motel, you know.

16:19.178 --> 16:21.749
Janice won't take me back.

16:21.781 --> 16:23.385
W-- where's Billy?

16:23.416 --> 16:25.589
He got a job cooking on a yacht.

16:25.618 --> 16:27.427
We're getting out of town.

16:27.453 --> 16:29.262
Here.

16:29.288 --> 16:30.961
Six grand.

16:33.092 --> 16:34.901
What happened to your face?

16:34.927 --> 16:37.601
Are you listening to me?
We all got to get out of town.

16:37.630 --> 16:40.008
W-what do you mean? The cops know?

16:41.767 --> 16:44.247
It ain't the cops you ought to be
worrying about.

16:46.138 --> 16:48.345
Then I'm going to need
more money than this.

16:48.374 --> 16:50.945
- Call your friend.
- Ain't going to happen, moron.

16:50.977 --> 16:53.321
If the cops know, than we got a real problem.

16:53.346 --> 16:55.348
Okay, there ain't no "we" anymore, Larry.

16:55.381 --> 16:57.156
There is me and Billy, and there is you.

16:57.183 --> 16:59.629
So if you are smart, you're gonna
listen to what I said.

17:11.931 --> 17:14.207
No, too short.

17:14.233 --> 17:16.736
Surveillance is my strong suit.

17:16.769 --> 17:18.874
( chuckles )

17:21.773 --> 17:25.153
Goren: That's the nicest lamp we've seen.

17:25.176 --> 17:27.487
You ever think what it's like
living down there?

17:27.512 --> 17:30.585
With what one bedrooms
are going for, I've considered it.

17:31.617 --> 17:34.325
My butt is getting cold.

17:38.991 --> 17:40.937
That's him.

17:40.960 --> 17:43.236
A water run.

17:50.369 --> 17:53.282
Suspect approaching with two water bottles.

18:08.387 --> 18:09.832
(grunts)

18:13.159 --> 18:15.730
Get off me! I didn't do anything.

18:15.761 --> 18:18.970
Sure you did. You're under
arrest for littering.

18:25.071 --> 18:27.449
I called Becky the next day

18:27.473 --> 18:30.010
and she said she sent Lois home
with a lot of money,

18:30.042 --> 18:31.453
but she never showed up.

18:31.477 --> 18:34.048
Why didn't you wait for her
instead of running away?

18:34.080 --> 18:37.254
I didn't like being
in the apartment without Lois.

18:37.283 --> 18:39.627
You could've reported her missing.

18:39.652 --> 18:41.928
Cops don't care about junkies.

18:41.954 --> 18:44.298
They do when your name's Van Acker.

18:44.323 --> 18:46.428
And get my mother involved?

18:46.459 --> 18:48.268
Did you try and find Becky?

18:48.294 --> 18:50.171
I don't know very much about her.

18:50.196 --> 18:54.042
She just came up to us at a bar
one day and started talking to us.

18:54.066 --> 18:56.012
It's not making sense, Dale.

18:56.035 --> 18:58.982
Please, I don't know what happened to Lois.

19:05.244 --> 19:08.589
Oh-- oh, God.

19:10.049 --> 19:12.859
Bunny-- my bunny.

19:12.885 --> 19:16.628
This is a picture of two dead people, Dale.

19:16.656 --> 19:19.330
Lois, and the baby inside her.

19:19.358 --> 19:22.134
Is it your baby?

19:22.161 --> 19:23.970
Yes.

19:26.565 --> 19:29.739
We think Becky and the two guys
that you mentioned--

19:29.769 --> 19:33.012
the ones with the store tags
on their suits--

19:33.906 --> 19:35.977
we think they killed Lois,

19:36.008 --> 19:38.249
but we can't figure out why.

19:38.277 --> 19:39.984
Maybe someone put 'em up to it.

19:40.012 --> 19:43.425
No, there was no reason.

19:43.449 --> 19:45.520
Your mother gave us a good one.

19:45.551 --> 19:48.862
She wouldn't give you any money
unless you got rid of Lois.

19:48.888 --> 19:51.596
Maybe Lois wouldn't go easy. Why would she?

19:51.624 --> 19:54.332
She's carrying a Van Acker. That's worth what,

19:54.360 --> 19:56.340
$50, $60 million?

19:56.362 --> 19:58.774
Money wasn't important to Lois.

19:58.798 --> 20:01.472
It's important to you.
You got a habit to feed.

20:06.739 --> 20:10.710
L-- I didn't kill Lois.

20:12.478 --> 20:14.116
I loved her.

20:14.146 --> 20:16.888
We were going to get clean and get married.

20:16.916 --> 20:18.896
And raise a family on a junkie's salary?

20:18.918 --> 20:21.865
I thought Mom would come around in time.

20:21.887 --> 20:25.300
Right. So you told her
you were coming to get her.

20:25.324 --> 20:27.895
- That's why you borrowed the cab fare.
- Yes.

20:27.927 --> 20:31.500
So you went to the hotel and you
found out what room she was in...

20:39.572 --> 20:42.052
No.

20:42.074 --> 20:44.179
I forgot the name.

20:44.210 --> 20:46.121
What, of the hotel?

20:57.890 --> 21:00.996
So what'd you do if you
didn't go to the hotel?

21:04.396 --> 21:07.434
You bought some dope and you got high.

21:07.466 --> 21:10.174
- Is that what you did?
- Yes.

21:10.202 --> 21:12.978
- Because you felt bad about
having Lois killed?
- No!

21:13.005 --> 21:14.678
You had feelings for her,

21:14.707 --> 21:18.245
maybe you wanted to go on seeing her
on the side without Mom knowing.

21:18.277 --> 21:21.918
But she went and got pregnant.

21:23.215 --> 21:26.253
And you had to do

21:26.285 --> 21:28.265
what you had to do.

21:29.622 --> 21:31.659
( door opens )

21:31.690 --> 21:34.102
Well, isn't this cozy?

21:34.126 --> 21:35.969
Dale, your mother hired me

21:35.995 --> 21:39.340
to represent you on this "littering" charge.

21:39.365 --> 21:42.744
If we can get a little privacy?

21:49.408 --> 21:52.514
All those in favor of he's our guy,
raise your hand.

21:53.879 --> 21:55.790
Oh, that's good.

21:55.815 --> 21:57.920
Well, I'm voting he did it.

21:57.950 --> 22:00.157
Pile whatever you need
on top of the littering.

22:00.186 --> 22:02.564
He's not getting out
without some serious bail.

22:09.495 --> 22:12.169
Eames: If you could tell
us if it's one of yours?

22:12.198 --> 22:13.871
Well, it sure looks like it.

22:13.899 --> 22:16.505
This is worsted wool,
and that would be over here.

22:16.535 --> 22:18.515
Was the murdered body wearing the jacket?

22:18.537 --> 22:20.414
Are you looking for a promotional angle?

22:20.439 --> 22:23.420
- Why? Was it somebody famous?
- No.

22:23.442 --> 22:26.116
Janice, these detectives are
working a big murder case.

22:26.145 --> 22:28.682
They're asking if this
is off one of our jackets.

22:28.714 --> 22:32.218
I'm thinking worsted wool with checks.

22:32.251 --> 22:35.255
We had one of those left
a couple of weeks ago.

22:35.287 --> 22:37.597
Well, I don't recognize it.

22:37.623 --> 22:40.968
Do you mind looking it up in your records?

22:40.993 --> 22:44.065
I don't know what good that would do.

22:44.096 --> 22:48.067
- Is it in here?
- Yeah, I'll look.

22:48.100 --> 22:50.205
- What about these tags?
- I'm getting there.

22:50.236 --> 22:53.149
Salesman: Are you getting any
closer to catching the murderer?

22:53.172 --> 22:55.914
- Getting closer by the minute.
- I don't see anything in here.

22:55.941 --> 22:57.614
What about this batch?

22:59.645 --> 23:03.457
I don't have to look. It's my husband.

23:09.455 --> 23:12.698
Housekeeping, ready or not.

23:12.725 --> 23:15.467
Larry: Hey, hey, what are you doing?
What's going on?

23:15.494 --> 23:18.964
- I didn't do anything.
- Shut up, Larry. You're
under arrest for murder.

23:18.998 --> 23:21.000
- But-- but--
- Let's go settle your bill.

23:21.033 --> 23:23.172
I'm innocent of everything. Oww! Oww!

23:23.202 --> 23:25.614
- What's wrong with your leg?
- Nothing. It's fine.

23:25.638 --> 23:27.549
- Where'd you get this?
- Oww!

23:27.573 --> 23:29.018
Over Lois Romney's big toe?

23:29.041 --> 23:31.214
No, I don't know what you're talking about.

23:31.243 --> 23:32.813
This is-- ahh-- it's a big mistake.

23:32.845 --> 23:35.485
The mistake was pissing off
your wife. We talked to her.

23:35.514 --> 23:37.494
My wife? Oh. Oww!

23:37.516 --> 23:39.427
Listen, all I did was hold her feet.

23:39.451 --> 23:42.227
- Billy and Becky did the murder.
- Last names, Larry.

23:42.254 --> 23:45.565
Ahh! Becky Stark. She's a stripper.

23:45.591 --> 23:48.094
- Billy's just Billy.
- Where are they?

23:48.127 --> 23:50.004
They're on a yacht. Oww!

23:50.029 --> 23:53.169
No, Billy got a good job cooking.
He's a pretty good chef.

23:54.433 --> 23:56.936
They said they were going to Tortola.

24:01.473 --> 24:03.953
I can't sleep, it's so noisy.

24:03.976 --> 24:07.321
I can't eat the food.
Why haven't you paid the bail?

24:07.346 --> 24:10.122
- I'm not ready to have you home.
- I don't want to go home.

24:10.149 --> 24:13.460
I don't want to be in the same house with you.

24:13.485 --> 24:15.829
I want to get back into rehab.

24:15.854 --> 24:18.664
I've been clean two days on my own now.

24:18.691 --> 24:21.570
Please, Mother, I hate this place.

24:21.593 --> 24:24.597
I know, but--

24:24.630 --> 24:27.543
I've put some money in your account here.

24:27.566 --> 24:31.639
- Don't give me money.
- You can use it to put your mind at ease.

24:33.439 --> 24:35.476
This is no place to detox.

24:37.009 --> 24:40.547
When you do get home,
Mother will help you get clean.

24:49.955 --> 24:53.027
Becky knows the guy who hired us. I don't.

24:53.058 --> 24:56.005
I swear, she met him at the strip club.

24:56.028 --> 24:58.030
Look, I've got to get some sleep.

24:58.063 --> 25:01.909
He hasn't slept since you flew him and
his girlfriend back from Tortola.

25:01.934 --> 25:03.914
Just a few more minutes.

25:03.936 --> 25:07.281
Becky must have said something about him.

25:08.474 --> 25:10.579
She said he was hooked up to the government,

25:10.609 --> 25:12.316
some kind of badass secret agent.

25:12.344 --> 25:15.382
She was scared to tell me anything.

25:15.414 --> 25:17.155
That's all I know.

25:20.619 --> 25:22.758
It was Larry.

25:22.788 --> 25:25.359
It was at a party and we were all high.

25:25.391 --> 25:30.397
Lois mouthed off and Larry went nuts.

25:30.429 --> 25:33.171
He said that you all got $20 grand.

25:33.198 --> 25:37.203
You and Billy had about $12 on you
when you were busted.

25:37.236 --> 25:41.275
- Larry's lying. We saved that money.
- You saved the money.

25:41.306 --> 25:44.617
Yeah, we work, pay taxes.

25:44.643 --> 25:46.953
( chuckles )

25:48.947 --> 25:51.018
She's hilarious.

25:51.050 --> 25:54.031
What's that on your face near your eye?

25:54.053 --> 25:55.896
Nothing.

26:01.427 --> 26:03.100
It's a shiner, isn't it?

26:03.128 --> 26:05.130
I ran into a door.

26:08.434 --> 26:10.846
Someone slapped you around pretty good.

26:13.939 --> 26:16.442
I'm betting it wasn't Billy.

26:17.676 --> 26:19.883
It was the guy that hired you.

26:27.186 --> 26:29.325
You're scared of him.

26:33.792 --> 26:36.329
You're facing the death penalty.

26:37.663 --> 26:39.404
That means you die.

26:39.431 --> 26:41.707
Yeah, right.

26:41.733 --> 26:44.304
Guys like him push a button
and you're dead no matter what.

26:48.774 --> 26:51.414
Badass secret agent or not,
she's afraid of him.

26:51.443 --> 26:52.922
We're not going to budge her.

26:52.945 --> 26:55.983
You looked at her sheet?
Maybe your secret agent man's in there.

26:56.982 --> 27:00.725
- Little girl's been busy.
- Been hustling since she was 15.

27:00.752 --> 27:02.857
Billy's no slouch either. He learned to cook

27:02.888 --> 27:05.164
while doing 3 years for attempted robbery.

27:05.190 --> 27:08.967
You gotta wonder, why would
anyone with a yacht hire him?

27:08.994 --> 27:11.804
Well, you're going to find out, aren't you?

27:17.803 --> 27:19.714
Man: Unbelievable chaos.

27:19.738 --> 27:22.275
Cops running all over the ship
at the crack of dawn.

27:22.307 --> 27:25.550
And worst of all, now I have
to find a new cook.

27:25.577 --> 27:28.285
How'd you end up with
a four-star weasel like Bill Coffey?

27:28.313 --> 27:30.486
On a recommendation.

27:30.516 --> 27:33.395
- From whom?
- A classmate.

27:33.418 --> 27:35.898
A floor mate, actually, from my prep school.

27:35.921 --> 27:40.495
Jameson is the last person I would
expect to actually know somebody.

27:40.526 --> 27:42.472
- How's that?
- He's a jarhead.

27:42.494 --> 27:45.100
A real G. Gordon Liddy type.

27:45.130 --> 27:47.940
Always bragging about covert operations.

27:47.966 --> 27:50.003
I tried my best to avoid him at the reunion.

27:50.035 --> 27:52.675
Obviously I didn't try hard enough.

27:52.704 --> 27:54.843
Class reunion.

27:54.873 --> 27:56.216
George W. show up?

27:56.241 --> 27:58.778
Yeah, as a matter of fact, he did.

28:08.053 --> 28:11.762
Mr. Jameson, Carl Ralston sends his regards.

28:11.790 --> 28:13.895
- What's this?
- You're under arrest

28:13.926 --> 28:15.769
for the murder of Lois Romney.

28:15.794 --> 28:17.330
What, you're serious?

28:17.362 --> 28:19.706
You don't see us wearing clown shoes, do you?

28:19.731 --> 28:21.733
Anderson, call my wife.

28:24.803 --> 28:28.250
On the one hand, you told the
detectives you didn't know Becky.

28:28.273 --> 28:31.811
On the other, you recommended
her boyfriend for a job.

28:31.843 --> 28:34.881
You're operating under
a misapprehension of the facts.

28:34.913 --> 28:38.019
- Roger.
- Holden, I've been interrogated by experts

28:38.050 --> 28:40.997
and I've got the scars
on my genitals to prove it.

28:41.019 --> 28:44.967
They asked me if Dale had
ever mentioned Becky to me.

28:44.990 --> 28:47.596
He hadn't. I didn't know they'd become friends.

28:48.894 --> 28:50.931
Now you're saying you know her?

28:50.963 --> 28:53.944
In my former profession, I developed contacts

28:53.966 --> 28:56.742
across all stratas of society. I still do.

28:56.768 --> 29:00.045
Becky might've sought
Dale out after meeting me.

29:00.072 --> 29:01.881
Maybe she had her eye on his trust fund.

29:01.907 --> 29:04.888
Maybe she decided to get Lois out of the way.
You'd have to ask her.

29:04.910 --> 29:06.685
We asked her accomplice.

29:06.712 --> 29:08.123
He said, and I quote,

29:08.146 --> 29:11.593
"Some badass secret agent was behind this."

29:11.617 --> 29:15.622
And so far, Mr. Jameson,
you are talking the talk.

29:15.654 --> 29:17.565
My client is a career military man.

29:17.589 --> 29:20.593
He has no money of his own--
no discretionary income--

29:20.626 --> 29:24.938
so the idea that he gave
anyone $20,000 is ridiculous.

29:24.963 --> 29:29.708
Other than that, he's invoking
his right to remain silent.

29:31.937 --> 29:35.942
It's incredible.
First my son and now my husband.

29:35.974 --> 29:38.011
You people are all over the map.

29:38.043 --> 29:40.853
We're pretty good at reading maps,
Mrs. Van Acker.

29:40.879 --> 29:43.416
I checked your son's status.

29:43.448 --> 29:45.587
His bail hasn't been paid.

29:45.617 --> 29:48.757
- Do you have children, Detective?
- No.

29:48.787 --> 29:51.233
When you do, you'll understand

29:51.256 --> 29:53.964
that a mother's love isn't all about cookies

29:53.992 --> 29:56.097
and kissing their boo-boos.

29:56.128 --> 29:59.041
- Priscilla Van Acker.
- Assistant District Attorney Carver.

29:59.064 --> 30:01.943
- Thank you so much for coming.
- I didn't have much choice.

30:01.967 --> 30:03.844
You stripped me of my family.

30:04.936 --> 30:08.440
I can't believe Roger had anything
to do with killing that girl.

30:08.473 --> 30:11.044
Doesn't seem to have a motive.

30:11.076 --> 30:14.080
Maybe to help your son.

30:15.480 --> 30:17.687
And why would he do that?

30:23.789 --> 30:26.269
Never occurred to me.

30:26.291 --> 30:28.567
What's that, Mrs. Van Acker?

30:32.531 --> 30:36.502
If Roger knew the girl was pregnant...

30:38.704 --> 30:41.651
There's a codicil in my late husband's will

30:41.673 --> 30:45.120
that excludes Roger from
any part of my estate

30:45.143 --> 30:46.918
if Dale has an heir.

30:47.913 --> 30:50.416
It cuts him off entirely.

30:51.450 --> 30:54.954
I'm older than my husband
and not in the best of health.

30:54.986 --> 30:58.365
I hate to say this but...

30:58.390 --> 31:00.836
Maybe he was thinking ahead.

31:07.532 --> 31:10.536
Bailiff: Docket number 396015.

31:10.569 --> 31:12.640
People versus Dale Van Acker.

31:12.671 --> 31:14.514
Is there an application from the People?

31:14.539 --> 31:16.610
Yes, Your Honor, the People move to withdraw

31:16.641 --> 31:18.348
all charges against Mr. Van Acker.

31:18.377 --> 31:20.880
So ordered. Next up.

31:25.350 --> 31:28.126
Bailiff: Docket number 396151.

31:28.153 --> 31:30.793
People versus Roger Lucas Jameson.

31:30.822 --> 31:32.392
Murder in the first degree.

31:32.424 --> 31:34.802
Conspiracy in the first degree.

31:34.826 --> 31:37.466
- How do you plead?
- Not guilty.

31:37.496 --> 31:40.807
- People on bail?
- Remand, Your Honor.

31:40.832 --> 31:43.711
Your Honor, my client was a military officer.

31:43.735 --> 31:46.682
- He has ties to the community.
- To many communities.

31:46.705 --> 31:48.844
Mr. Jameson has homes in four countries.

31:48.874 --> 31:51.115
One of which has no
extradition treaty with us.

31:51.143 --> 31:52.554
He is a flight risk.

31:52.577 --> 31:54.818
I agree. Bail is denied.

31:54.846 --> 31:58.487
Docket number 396016...

32:05.424 --> 32:06.869
It's heartwarming, isn't it?

32:06.892 --> 32:10.032
You gave her a choice and she
chose to send hubby to jail.

32:14.433 --> 32:16.379
Well, she got what she wanted all along.

32:16.401 --> 32:19.041
Are you suggesting what I think you are?

32:19.070 --> 32:21.209
If you want to get to her,

32:21.239 --> 32:23.219
first close the noose on Jameson.

32:23.241 --> 32:26.415
Prove the $20,000 payoff came from him.

32:28.914 --> 32:32.054
Caldicott says they found out
about the codicil.

32:32.083 --> 32:34.063
How in God's name do they know?

32:34.085 --> 32:35.393
I'd even forgotten about it.

32:35.420 --> 32:37.866
Every day they show up with a new warrant.

32:37.889 --> 32:40.096
They've taken every scrap of paper.

32:40.125 --> 32:42.002
They were bound to find out.

32:42.027 --> 32:44.667
- But it doesn't matter.
- Priscilla,

32:44.696 --> 32:47.438
they now have a motive
they can only ascribe to me!

32:47.466 --> 32:49.673
There's nothing to worry about

32:49.701 --> 32:52.875
as long as that stripper of yours
keeps her mouth shut.

32:52.904 --> 32:55.475
I told you, Roger,

32:55.507 --> 32:57.783
I've forgiven you your little indiscretion.

32:57.809 --> 33:00.756
Now I know you're going
to get out of here soon.

33:00.779 --> 33:02.452
In the meantime, make the best of it.

33:02.481 --> 33:05.724
And remember, I do love you.

33:11.756 --> 33:14.999
These people were living off the
interest on their tax-free munis.

33:15.026 --> 33:16.869
$2 million a year net.

33:16.895 --> 33:18.499
Practically hand-to-mouth.

33:18.530 --> 33:20.339
It wasn't all caviar and champagne.

33:20.365 --> 33:22.470
They put half a mil a year into their charity,

33:22.501 --> 33:24.412
"The Equine Rights Foundation."

33:24.436 --> 33:26.916
Let me guess, they find homes
for retired polo ponies.

33:26.938 --> 33:29.179
I can't see where Jameson
came up with the $20 grand.

33:29.207 --> 33:31.118
He's got no money of his own,

33:31.142 --> 33:34.021
and Mrs. Van Acker was giving him an
allowance of $10 grand a month,

33:34.045 --> 33:35.649
all of which is accounted for

33:35.680 --> 33:37.591
Here's where he might've gotten it.

33:37.616 --> 33:40.222
It's a letter to Jameson dated last month

33:40.252 --> 33:44.291
asking for the breeding registration on a
4-year old quarter-horse named Mr. Lincoln.

33:44.322 --> 33:47.496
- He sold a horse.
- To the Burgman Stables.

33:52.831 --> 33:55.175
We'd been after Priscilla
to sell us Mr. Lincoln

33:55.200 --> 33:57.578
since we first saw him
workout as a 2-year-old.

33:57.602 --> 33:59.172
Then Roger called and said

33:59.204 --> 34:04.051
she'd decided to sell Mr. Lincoln
for $25,000-- which was a steal.

34:04.075 --> 34:06.885
We said, "Hooray," and wrote
a check and got our horse.

34:06.912 --> 34:09.859
So Mrs. Van Acker knew
her husband sold the horse?

34:09.880 --> 34:12.554
I thought so, but I ran into her at Payard.

34:12.583 --> 34:14.757
I thanked her for Mr. Lincoln.

34:14.786 --> 34:17.699
She said she had no idea Roger had sold him.

34:17.722 --> 34:20.896
- What'd she do?
- She wanted Mr. Lincoln back.

34:23.061 --> 34:25.667
So they sold a horse.
They sell a few horses--

34:25.697 --> 34:28.473
Except this time the check was
cashed at the Burgmans bank,

34:28.500 --> 34:31.139
and there's no record that the cash
was deposited anywhere.

34:31.168 --> 34:33.978
Another "so what?" Is this all you've got?

34:34.005 --> 34:37.976
We traced the $100 bills that were found
on Becky Stark to the Burgman's bank.

34:38.009 --> 34:40.751
In the trade we call that conclusive evidence.

34:40.779 --> 34:43.918
Now the DA and I hold a dim view of people

34:43.949 --> 34:47.293
who hire other people to kill pregnant women.

34:47.319 --> 34:51.324
So we've already agreed amongst
ourselves to seek the death penalty.

34:51.356 --> 34:54.098
So you might start thinking
about cooperating with us.

34:54.125 --> 34:55.967
You have your story, we have ours.

34:55.994 --> 34:58.838
The money was given to Dale to get...

34:58.863 --> 35:02.811
Lois Romney an abortion,
to pay her to go away.

35:02.834 --> 35:06.304
If Dale used that money
to have Ms. Romney killed,

35:06.338 --> 35:08.113
that's his responsibility.

35:08.139 --> 35:10.585
Can anybody verify that you
gave the money to Dale?

35:10.609 --> 35:12.589
Ask my wife, it was her horse.

35:12.611 --> 35:14.090
We asked Mrs. Burgman.

35:17.082 --> 35:19.460
Your wife told her she never agreed to sell.

35:19.484 --> 35:22.055
In fact, she said she
asked for the horse back.

35:22.087 --> 35:24.590
So you see, Mr. Jameson,

35:24.623 --> 35:27.399
the only fingers in the pie are yours.

35:28.560 --> 35:29.732
One more thing--

35:29.761 --> 35:33.299
did we mention it was your wife that
told us about the codicil?

35:33.331 --> 35:36.972
The one about your being
cut out of the inheritance.

35:45.710 --> 35:47.280
(sighs)

35:47.312 --> 35:50.225
That...

35:50.248 --> 35:53.786
vindictive stupid bitch.

35:53.818 --> 35:56.924
We are all ears.

36:00.091 --> 36:02.537
It was her idea.

36:02.560 --> 36:05.404
She was afraid that if Dale had a child,

36:05.430 --> 36:07.273
she'd lose him forever.

36:07.298 --> 36:11.144
I said we should just pay
the girl off! But she said no.

36:11.169 --> 36:13.672
She wanted her out of the picture permanently,

36:13.705 --> 36:16.117
and she told me what to do.

36:19.244 --> 36:20.518
And you did it?

36:23.548 --> 36:25.619
For her.

36:27.152 --> 36:29.223
She was beside herself.

36:31.623 --> 36:33.660
You have no idea...

36:35.160 --> 36:37.299
The effect that boy had on her.

36:38.663 --> 36:40.973
Carver: Does he know what his mother did?

36:40.999 --> 36:44.173
He must by now. He's the one who
told her the girl was pregnant.

36:44.202 --> 36:47.411
Of course, if you want my client to
repeat any of this on the stand,

36:47.439 --> 36:49.578
murder one is off the table.

36:49.607 --> 36:52.110
Your client's testimony
against Mrs. Van Acker

36:52.143 --> 36:55.681
is of no value to us unless
we can corroborate it.

36:55.714 --> 36:59.719
If your stepson knows anything,
would he talk with us?

37:00.785 --> 37:03.459
Jameson: And send his mommy to jail?

37:05.290 --> 37:07.566
He's an only child.

37:07.592 --> 37:09.663
He may hate her with every bone in his body,

37:09.694 --> 37:12.004
but he can't live without her.

37:15.533 --> 37:17.308
Mr. Jameson...

37:20.405 --> 37:23.875
Would you like to help me
with a covert operation?

37:30.482 --> 37:33.088
How's it going?

37:34.185 --> 37:35.823
This is good.

37:35.854 --> 37:39.666
I'll tell you, it ain't easy
copying off a grocery list.

37:41.259 --> 37:44.604
What a horrid place.
I can't believe you've lived here.

37:44.629 --> 37:47.906
Was it absolutely necessary to bring us here?

37:47.932 --> 37:50.845
We only need Dale's help,
you're welcome to wait downstairs.

37:50.869 --> 37:52.974
That's all right.

37:53.004 --> 37:55.746
I've mucked out stables.
It can't be any worse than that.

38:01.179 --> 38:03.216
Dale, please open a window.

38:05.717 --> 38:07.754
Now what is it you want Dale's help with?

38:07.786 --> 38:10.494
We need you to show us where
Lois kept her important papers--

38:10.522 --> 38:12.900
birth certificate, bank
book, things like that?

38:12.924 --> 38:14.995
How about it, Dale?

38:15.026 --> 38:16.664
She had a shoebox...

38:16.694 --> 38:18.640
In the drawer in the kitchen table.

38:18.663 --> 38:21.735
What are you looking for precisely?

38:22.734 --> 38:24.771
We found evidence your husband

38:24.803 --> 38:26.578
might've given Lois money.

38:26.604 --> 38:30.051
- We're trying to confirm it.
- Really? How much?

38:30.074 --> 38:32.918
- $100,000.
- That's impossible.

38:32.944 --> 38:35.322
Roger doesn't have that kind of money.

38:35.346 --> 38:37.553
We'll see.

38:45.790 --> 38:47.701
Goren: Have a seat.

38:52.630 --> 38:55.304
The Medical Examiner said
that Lois stopped using

38:55.333 --> 38:59.304
a couple weeks before she was killed.

39:01.706 --> 39:04.482
She was getting ready for the baby.

39:04.509 --> 39:06.511
Yes.

39:06.544 --> 39:08.717
She was a strong person.

39:08.746 --> 39:10.657
Yes, stronger than me.

39:10.682 --> 39:12.684
Weren't you trying to get clean, too?

39:12.717 --> 39:13.923
Yes.

39:15.887 --> 39:18.458
Sounds like she brought out
the better part of you.

39:18.489 --> 39:21.527
- Yes.
- How much longer is this going to take?

39:21.559 --> 39:24.199
"Returned due to insufficient postage."

39:24.229 --> 39:26.766
Somebody must've missed the last rate hike.

39:30.034 --> 39:33.538
It's addressed to you, Mrs. Van Acker.

39:33.571 --> 39:37.212
- Is this your handwriting?
- No, it's Lois'.

39:40.478 --> 39:44.051
- Can I open it?
- Go ahead, it's of no consequence now.

39:49.787 --> 39:51.460
What is it?

39:51.489 --> 39:53.594
It's a check.

39:53.625 --> 39:56.936
For $100,000, made out to Lois Romney,

39:56.961 --> 39:58.634
signed Roger Jameson.

39:58.663 --> 40:01.542
- That's impossible.
- Is that your husband's signature?

40:01.566 --> 40:05.378
Yes, but I can assure you
I did not authorize this check.

40:05.403 --> 40:08.316
Lois wrote you a note.

40:09.574 --> 40:11.918
"Dear. Mrs. Van Acker,

40:11.943 --> 40:15.015
thank you for the... check,

40:15.046 --> 40:16.957
but Dale is more important to me

40:16.981 --> 40:19.587
than all the money you could give me."

40:20.818 --> 40:24.459
We're going to get married
and have a beautiful baby.

40:25.757 --> 40:30.069
All I want to do is help Dale become
the man he was meant to be.

40:30.094 --> 40:32.665
And just because he loves me,

40:32.697 --> 40:35.268
doesn't mean he'll stop loving you."

40:35.300 --> 40:37.678
You should read this yourself.

40:59.924 --> 41:02.063
This woman loved you.

41:06.798 --> 41:08.300
You know who killed her.

41:08.333 --> 41:11.041
That's why you didn't go home after she died.

41:11.069 --> 41:13.345
You-- you couldn't--

41:13.371 --> 41:16.875
you couldn't face the person
that took Lois away from you.

41:16.908 --> 41:18.148
Dale, let's go.

41:18.176 --> 41:21.248
- Don't let your mother get away with this.
- Leave my son alone.

41:21.279 --> 41:23.088
You don't owe her anything.

41:23.114 --> 41:24.991
That's not true. He owes me everything.

41:25.016 --> 41:27.292
That's why you destroyed
the person he loved?

41:27.318 --> 41:29.889
- She was destroying him.
- That's what they all say.

41:29.921 --> 41:33.232
My mother didn't like my girlfriends
either, even if she pretended to,

41:33.257 --> 41:35.294
but she didn't kill any of them...

41:35.326 --> 41:37.602
Because she wanted me to be happy.

41:39.330 --> 41:42.277
- Your mother doesn't want that for you.
- Don't listen to this.

41:42.300 --> 41:44.507
No, listen to her.

41:44.535 --> 41:46.879
What did she just say about Lois?

41:46.904 --> 41:49.384
"She's of no consequence"?

41:50.675 --> 41:52.211
Come on, Dale!

41:52.243 --> 41:54.086
Be the man that Lois wanted you to be,

41:54.112 --> 41:58.083
the man that Lois knew that you could be.

42:01.552 --> 42:03.623
Dale, if you think I will ever forgive you--

42:03.654 --> 42:05.531
How could you have done that to her?!

42:06.524 --> 42:08.026
You had no right.

42:11.062 --> 42:12.905
Dale, be quiet.

42:14.565 --> 42:18.308
What did she do, Dale?
What did your mother do to Lois?

42:18.336 --> 42:20.475
I told her Lois was pregnant,

42:20.505 --> 42:22.576
because I didn't want her to feel left out.

42:22.607 --> 42:25.019
She said, "I'll take care of everything."

42:25.043 --> 42:28.456
I thought she meant Lois
and me and the baby--

42:28.479 --> 42:29.890
that she'd help us.

42:33.284 --> 42:36.754
After Lois was missing,
I called her and she said,

42:36.788 --> 42:39.701
"Didn't I tell you I'd
take care of everything?"

42:56.674 --> 42:59.382
(handcuffs click)

43:10.922 --> 43:13.960
She took 25 to life, same as the other four.

43:13.991 --> 43:17.063
I've got to meet with Penzarella,
thank him for his work.

43:17.095 --> 43:20.167
- You'd find this guy interesting.
- I would?

43:20.198 --> 43:23.645
He's a forger. Specializes in
letters from famous people.

43:23.668 --> 43:26.012
Sometimes not so famous.
