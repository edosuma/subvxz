WEBVTT

00:24.825 --> 00:27.495
* *

00:54.755 --> 00:57.024
All right, position one?

00:57.091 --> 00:57.891
Set.

00:57.958 --> 00:59.393
Position two?

00:59.460 --> 01:00.928
Position two is set, Don.

01:00.994 --> 01:03.364
All right, we go on my signal,
everybody. Repeat, on my signal.

01:03.431 --> 01:04.932
CHARLIE:
It's really kind of exciting.

01:04.998 --> 01:07.101
Money laundering?

01:07.168 --> 01:09.537
Modeling illegal activity
using Social

01:09.603 --> 01:12.039
Network math.

01:12.106 --> 01:13.874
Link Analysis.

01:13.941 --> 01:15.176
We use that for the Mob.

01:15.243 --> 01:18.212
Well, that provides
fairly basic connections,

01:18.279 --> 01:21.349
but Flock Theory shows
how the network moves,

01:21.415 --> 01:23.083
how it changes as a whole,

01:23.151 --> 01:25.586
from the meth lab workers,
through the distribution chain,

01:25.653 --> 01:27.188
and ultimately, to the streets.

01:27.255 --> 01:29.457
We can determine leaders
and followers,

01:29.523 --> 01:31.525
speed and direction of growth.

01:31.592 --> 01:34.662
Emergent Self-Organization
predicts subtle dynamics

01:34.728 --> 01:35.963
of human behavior.

01:36.029 --> 01:36.764
It's wild.

01:36.830 --> 01:38.799
That's just
what I was gonna say.

01:38.866 --> 01:39.933
So, have they gone in yet?

01:40.000 --> 01:41.402
Just about to.

01:42.736 --> 01:43.804
DEA?

01:46.740 --> 01:48.442
MAN:
DEA, set.

01:48.509 --> 01:49.510
All right, let's hit it.

01:49.577 --> 01:51.078
Let's hit it. Execute, execute.

01:51.145 --> 01:52.680
Execute.

01:52.746 --> 01:53.781
Hold! Hold! Hold! Hold!

01:53.847 --> 01:55.983
We got a civilian,
civilian, civilian.

01:56.049 --> 01:56.884
COLBY:
Holding, Don.

02:02.656 --> 02:03.791
Colby, grab her.

02:03.857 --> 02:04.825
Okay, got it.

02:06.294 --> 02:09.096
Ma'am?

02:09.163 --> 02:10.231
Hello?

02:10.298 --> 02:11.832
Ma'am? Excuse me, ma'am?

02:11.899 --> 02:13.567
( sighs )

02:16.504 --> 02:17.838
Hello?

02:17.905 --> 02:18.739
Ah.

02:18.806 --> 02:20.007
What can I do for you?

02:20.073 --> 02:21.242
I need a stove-top re-chromed.

02:21.309 --> 02:22.610
Do you do that?

02:22.676 --> 02:23.511
Colby, back off!

02:23.577 --> 02:25.679
Just wait till she's out.

02:26.514 --> 02:28.382
Sure.

02:28.449 --> 02:29.983
You got the measurements?

02:30.050 --> 02:32.653
Yeah, in here somewhere.

02:32.720 --> 02:35.389
( touch tone phone beeping )

02:35.456 --> 02:37.725
Don, he's making a phone call.

02:39.059 --> 02:40.961
Yeah, it's me.

02:41.028 --> 02:42.129
That's right.

02:42.196 --> 02:43.397
Colby, did he see you?

02:43.464 --> 02:44.932
I don't know, Don.

02:44.998 --> 02:46.367
Megan, trace the call.
What's he saying?

02:46.434 --> 02:47.868
( distorted voices )

02:47.935 --> 02:50.070
He's warning somebody.

02:50.137 --> 02:52.706
Damn it! I don't want
a hostage situation here.

02:54.074 --> 02:55.709
Colby, as soon as I have her,

02:55.776 --> 02:57.511
come in full force.
Megan, you get backup

02:57.578 --> 02:58.979
and hightail it
to whatever address you get

02:59.046 --> 03:00.013
on that trace,
do you hear me?

03:00.080 --> 03:00.814
On it.

03:00.881 --> 03:02.115
DON: All right, David,
you're with me.

03:02.182 --> 03:03.083
Follow my lead, let's go.

03:03.150 --> 03:05.419
This is Agent Reeves,
I need an insertion team ASAP,

03:05.486 --> 03:08.121
going to 5735 East 19th Street.

03:08.188 --> 03:10.291
I'll be on location.

03:10.358 --> 03:12.593
Megan, that address is anomalous
to the pattern.

03:12.660 --> 03:13.827
You know,
that changes everything.

03:13.894 --> 03:15.996
-It might be nothing,
-Yeah, but if it is connected,

03:16.063 --> 03:16.964
I have to recalculate.

03:17.030 --> 03:20.067
It could open up other
locations, so, I'd like to come.

03:20.133 --> 03:21.435
I don't think so.

03:21.502 --> 03:22.636
I need to see the area.

03:22.703 --> 03:24.204
I need to see
how much of it is residential,

03:24.272 --> 03:26.307
see what businesses are around--
there's really a wealth of data

03:26.374 --> 03:27.875
I can only amass

03:27.941 --> 03:28.809
by seeing the environment.

03:28.876 --> 03:30.511
Okay, but you have
to stay in the car.

03:31.379 --> 03:33.781
Locked and loaded.

03:45.993 --> 03:47.027
Hey, sweetie.

03:47.094 --> 03:48.061
Do they have it?

03:48.128 --> 03:48.796
DAVID:
Hey!

03:48.862 --> 03:49.330
FBI.

03:49.397 --> 03:50.398
Don't do it!

03:53.267 --> 03:54.735
DON:
We're FBI.

03:54.802 --> 03:56.604
You're okay.
Don't move. Tommy.

03:57.571 --> 03:58.906
-You all right?
-I'm fine.

03:58.972 --> 04:01.041
Got it.

04:01.108 --> 04:02.976
MAN:
Tiny!

04:03.043 --> 04:03.777
Tiny!

04:03.844 --> 04:05.513
Tiny's not able
to hear you right now.

04:05.579 --> 04:06.980
MAN:
Is he dead?

04:07.047 --> 04:08.048
What, you kill him?

04:08.115 --> 04:08.982
We secure?

04:09.049 --> 04:10.518
Any sign of the lab?

04:10.584 --> 04:11.652
There's nothing, huh?

04:11.719 --> 04:12.853
We got precursor chemicals.

04:12.920 --> 04:14.488
There's enough to make
200-300 pounds of meth.

04:14.555 --> 04:15.956
How can the lab
not be here?

04:16.023 --> 04:17.491
Where is it?

04:17.558 --> 04:19.527
Careful!
Smell those fumes?

04:19.593 --> 04:20.661
One spark's enough

04:20.728 --> 04:22.863
to blow the roof
off this place and us with it.

04:22.930 --> 04:23.964
Just be careful.

04:25.599 --> 04:28.502
CHARLIE: This really doesn't
make any sense.

04:28.569 --> 04:29.870
Oh, it does to me.

04:29.937 --> 04:31.639
We traced the call
to this location.

04:31.705 --> 04:33.006
This guy's getting
ready to run.

04:33.073 --> 04:35.943
Unless we're in an entirely
different model.

04:38.746 --> 04:39.780
Here we go.

04:41.882 --> 04:43.484
Hey, Reeves,
what have you got?

04:43.551 --> 04:45.252
I have one guy inside.

04:45.319 --> 04:46.754
Looks like
he's getting ready to run.

04:46.820 --> 04:48.522
MAN: How do you want
to play it?

04:48.589 --> 04:50.391
I think it's best
if we take him inside.

04:50.458 --> 04:51.659
Two teams in front.

04:51.725 --> 04:53.794
I'll send my other two
men to cover the back.

04:53.861 --> 04:55.863
Let's do it.

05:16.350 --> 05:17.317
Wait!

05:18.085 --> 05:19.887
( explosion )

05:38.372 --> 05:43.711
( siren wailing )

05:43.777 --> 05:46.480
We all use math every day,

05:46.547 --> 05:48.449
to predict weather,

05:48.516 --> 05:50.584
to tell time,

05:50.651 --> 05:53.421
to handle money.

05:55.055 --> 05:58.826
Math is more than formulas
and equations.

05:58.892 --> 06:01.261
It's logic... rationality.

06:01.328 --> 06:02.696
It's using your mind

06:02.763 --> 06:04.698
to solve the biggest mysteries
that we know.

06:16.710 --> 06:18.912
( sirens blaring )

06:24.452 --> 06:26.854
This guy was ready
for war, Charlie.

06:28.922 --> 06:30.157
Where's Megan?

06:30.223 --> 06:32.392
She's over there.

06:32.460 --> 06:33.627
Who was the
guy in there?

06:33.694 --> 06:35.295
So, there was a guy?

06:35.362 --> 06:36.296
You saw him?

06:36.363 --> 06:37.765
No.

06:39.266 --> 06:42.570
If this was the lab, then
what was the other location?

06:42.636 --> 06:43.804
You, know, it's a...

06:43.871 --> 06:45.172
like a legit business
to buy the chemicals

06:45.238 --> 06:46.840
and launder the money,
but the lab was here.

06:46.907 --> 06:48.676
I mean, it was like superlab.
You could make 100

06:48.742 --> 06:50.310
pounds of the stuff
every few days.

06:50.377 --> 06:51.445
That's how many doses?

06:51.512 --> 06:53.847
Well, it's over
a half a million, at least.

06:53.914 --> 06:55.783
Now, why didn't it show up
on your map?

06:55.849 --> 06:57.818
I mean, they had to be moving
product in and out of here.

06:57.885 --> 07:00.120
My-My system wasn't
rich enough, you know?

07:00.187 --> 07:02.022
That this place is
connected is true,

07:02.089 --> 07:04.391
but I can't prove it,
given my axioms.

07:04.458 --> 07:05.859
I have to add
more information.

07:05.926 --> 07:07.461
So, it's possible
there could be more labs?

07:07.528 --> 07:08.662
Sure, it's possible.

07:08.729 --> 07:10.664
All right,
just give me a second.

07:14.568 --> 07:17.204
I saw the wiring
at the last second.

07:17.270 --> 07:18.405
I tried to stop him.

07:18.472 --> 07:19.640
Right.
Now, look, you can't

07:19.707 --> 07:20.841
beat yourself up about this now.

07:20.908 --> 07:22.710
You just can't, all right?

07:22.776 --> 07:24.077
Gallagher's dead.

07:24.144 --> 07:25.579
I told him to go in there.

07:25.646 --> 07:27.948
I had tactical command.

07:29.416 --> 07:30.718
( siren blaring )

07:30.784 --> 07:32.953
You saw somebody in there?

07:33.020 --> 07:34.855
White guy...

07:34.922 --> 07:36.423
30's, average build.

07:36.490 --> 07:37.625
I couldn't even see his face.

07:37.691 --> 07:39.493
Yeah, he's not there.

07:39.560 --> 07:41.629
There's no human remains
in there.

07:41.695 --> 07:43.096
Well, then, he must have
been standing

07:43.163 --> 07:45.866
at the center of the explosion,
and there's just nothing left.

07:45.933 --> 07:47.501
You sure about what you saw?

07:47.568 --> 07:49.837
-Absolutely.
-All right.

07:51.572 --> 07:54.575
( indistinct
radio communications )

07:54.642 --> 07:57.811
Uh, may I ask you
about that computer?

08:03.584 --> 08:05.653
Wait, wait, hold-hold on.
Put this on.

08:05.719 --> 08:06.920
What is it?

08:06.987 --> 08:09.056
It monitors meth concentration,
you know?

08:09.122 --> 08:11.491
When they cook the stuff,
the fumes get into the walls,

08:11.559 --> 08:13.193
the ceilings,
I mean, everything.

08:13.260 --> 08:16.263
Even breathing the crap can
make pinholes in your brain.

08:16.329 --> 08:18.666
That's just what I need.

08:18.732 --> 08:22.102
He was putting stuff
in a duffel bag.

08:22.169 --> 08:23.937
I don't know what--
clothes, money,

08:24.004 --> 08:26.239
I couldn't see--
and there was a window

08:26.306 --> 08:28.676
and curtains.

08:28.742 --> 08:31.144
You saw him through curtains?

08:32.445 --> 08:33.881
I saw him, Don.

08:33.947 --> 08:34.815
All right.

08:34.882 --> 08:36.183
Hey, we found something.

08:36.249 --> 08:38.085
Yeah. There's a tunnel.

08:38.151 --> 08:40.954
Vents from the lab upstairs
feed right down through there.

08:41.021 --> 08:43.591
That's why no one in the
neighborhood could smell it.

08:43.657 --> 08:46.594
Oh, yeah.

08:50.230 --> 08:51.565
All right.

08:51.632 --> 08:52.733
This is how he got out.

08:52.800 --> 08:54.034
( beeping )

08:54.101 --> 08:56.436
Whoa. Hey, let's get out
of here.

08:56.503 --> 08:57.838
All right?

08:57.905 --> 09:00.240
( beeping continues )

09:00.307 --> 09:02.409
Are we looking
for something specific

09:02.475 --> 09:04.778
beyond the guy's name?

09:04.845 --> 09:06.580
Who he was doing business with.

09:06.647 --> 09:08.882
We suspect that
there are additional meth labs

09:08.949 --> 09:10.517
because of the quantity
of chemicals

09:10.584 --> 09:12.352
seized at the chrome shop.

09:12.419 --> 09:13.520
All right, first,

09:13.587 --> 09:16.857
we'll hook the hard drive up
to a new computer.

09:16.924 --> 09:18.358
Same model it
was in before.

09:18.425 --> 09:19.727
Now the heat from the fire

09:19.793 --> 09:22.596
may have corrupted some
of the data path addresses, but

09:22.663 --> 09:24.732
probably not all.

09:24.798 --> 09:27.334
The address wasn't corrupt.

09:27.400 --> 09:28.602
Sorry?

09:28.669 --> 09:30.070
Nothing.

09:30.137 --> 09:31.972
I have a fact
that I know is true,

09:32.039 --> 09:35.208
but it doesn't fit the scheme
that I've worked out for it.

09:35.275 --> 09:37.344
So, the scheme is wrong.

09:37.410 --> 09:38.679
No. Incomplete.

09:38.746 --> 09:42.750
I need to expand my data.

09:42.816 --> 09:43.984
It's not booting,

09:44.051 --> 09:45.986
so I'll slide the plate off

09:46.053 --> 09:48.822
and try to read it
with a magnetic head.

09:49.723 --> 09:52.259
( beeps )

09:58.999 --> 10:01.769
So, the man who escaped
was the leader of the flock.

10:01.835 --> 10:02.770
The flock?!

10:02.836 --> 10:03.937
He doesn't follow the same rules

10:04.004 --> 10:05.605
as his subordinates--
he leads the way,

10:05.673 --> 10:07.007
therefore creating

10:07.074 --> 10:09.743
greater distance
between himself and the others.

10:09.810 --> 10:11.411
( beeping )

10:11.478 --> 10:12.780
Oop. Here we go.

10:12.846 --> 10:14.314
Lots of garbage.

10:16.183 --> 10:17.117
JPEG.

10:19.586 --> 10:21.889
( two beeps )

10:23.623 --> 10:25.826
Some sort of
digital photograph.

10:25.893 --> 10:27.394
Not too exciting.

10:27.460 --> 10:29.697
Well, maybe we can use
the Pradeep Sen method

10:29.763 --> 10:31.264
to see into the windows.

10:31.331 --> 10:33.366
He's take illumination
algorithms to the next level,

10:33.433 --> 10:36.003
and I can use them
to enhance this photograph.

10:38.005 --> 10:39.639
Well, what about
the tunnel?

10:39.707 --> 10:41.408
Let out about 50 feet away.

10:41.474 --> 10:42.642
And the house?

10:42.710 --> 10:43.944
Rented under an alias.

10:44.011 --> 10:47.347
So, we got all the underlings,
and the kingpin got away?

10:47.414 --> 10:49.582
Fire Commissioner
confirmed your suspicion.

10:49.649 --> 10:52.319
The explosion was set off
intentionally.

10:52.385 --> 10:54.688
So we want this guy for
murder as well as meth,

10:54.755 --> 10:56.890
and we don't know
anything about him?

11:01.361 --> 11:02.329
Mr. Rimbelli.

11:02.395 --> 11:03.563
Is Tiny dead?

11:03.630 --> 11:04.998
Tiny died

11:05.065 --> 11:06.566
trying to warn
your boss.

11:06.633 --> 11:08.769
To hell with you and him.

11:09.870 --> 11:11.304
Tiny was his brother.

11:15.408 --> 11:16.710
So your brother's dead,

11:16.777 --> 11:18.879
and you and your
crew are going to Chino,

11:18.946 --> 11:20.613
and your boss is gonna skate?

11:20.680 --> 11:21.982
Don't try to play me.

11:22.049 --> 11:23.650
I'm not the one
who's playing you.

11:23.717 --> 11:25.385
I mean, unless you
think your boss

11:25.452 --> 11:28.856
is gonna be sitting outside to
pick you up in ten or 15 years.

11:28.922 --> 11:29.957
You offering something?

11:30.023 --> 11:32.092
-I want a name.
-( chuckles )

11:32.159 --> 11:33.560
If you don't
know that...

11:33.626 --> 11:36.329
you don't know crap.

11:38.431 --> 11:40.100
What do you want?

11:40.167 --> 11:42.335
A low-end
sentence recommendation.

11:42.402 --> 11:43.136
( chuckles )

11:43.203 --> 11:44.938
And me and the boys
do our time together.

11:45.906 --> 11:48.208
What's the name?

11:49.076 --> 11:51.444
He's got a hundred aliases.

11:51.511 --> 11:53.346
But his name is

11:53.413 --> 11:55.715
...Lamberg.

11:55.783 --> 11:57.050
Derrick Lamberg.

12:03.090 --> 12:04.724
Where's he going?

12:04.792 --> 12:08.328
He's probably laying by his pool
at his place in Mexico.

12:10.730 --> 12:12.866
You won't get him.

12:12.933 --> 12:15.035
( chatting indistinctly )

12:15.102 --> 12:17.070
Hey, so Lamberg's not
in the system.

12:17.137 --> 12:19.572
No social, no driver's license,
no credit cards.

12:19.639 --> 12:22.642
-So it's either a bad name
or he's off the grid? -Yeah.

12:22.709 --> 12:24.211
We're waiting on
prints and DNA.

12:24.277 --> 12:25.946
He's got a house
in Mexico.

12:26.013 --> 12:28.748
Yeah? Well, let's get a
description out to the airports.

12:28.816 --> 12:31.651
You know? I mean, trains, buses,
borders, everything, right?

12:31.718 --> 12:32.920
Neighbors described him
same as Megan:

12:32.986 --> 12:34.587
mid-30's,
average Caucasian male.

12:34.654 --> 12:37.190
Well, that's no good. I mean,
we got to have more than that.

12:37.257 --> 12:38.758
MEGAN:
He's on the run,

12:38.826 --> 12:40.760
he's gonna need cash.

12:40.828 --> 12:43.296
So we find out who owes him
money and how he collects,

12:43.363 --> 12:45.065
-how he makes shipments...
-Yeah.

12:45.132 --> 12:47.100
These big operations
like to play it legit, you know?

12:47.167 --> 12:48.468
Delivery services,
wire transfers.

12:48.535 --> 12:50.337
Straight-up's the best cover,
so you should check up

12:50.403 --> 12:52.239
on any delivery companies
that went to that address.

12:52.305 --> 12:54.174
You get a hit, get a warrant,
you intercept

12:54.241 --> 12:55.442
whatever's being shipped
out of there.

12:55.508 --> 12:56.276
-You hear me?
-Got it.

12:58.111 --> 13:00.680
I'll follow up on the computer.

13:00.747 --> 13:02.582
-Megan.
-I'm all right, Don.

13:02.649 --> 13:05.518
Look, come here.
Hey, hold on.

13:05.585 --> 13:08.255
-Have you ever lost anyone
on your command? -No.

13:08.321 --> 13:09.222
'Cause I have.

13:09.289 --> 13:11.091
About ten months ago, a great
agent named Matthew KcKnight.

13:11.158 --> 13:12.792
And I didn't know
how it was gonna hit me,

13:12.860 --> 13:15.228
and I don't think you really
know how it's going to hit you.

13:15.295 --> 13:17.297
So what I'm thinking is
maybe you should go home,

13:17.364 --> 13:18.999
you know, I mean
just for a day.

13:19.066 --> 13:20.367
I'm not going to do that.

13:20.433 --> 13:22.569
You don't have anything
to prove around here.

13:22.635 --> 13:23.670
You know that, right?

13:23.736 --> 13:26.306
Yeah, so let me do my job.

13:28.508 --> 13:30.610
You sure?

13:30.677 --> 13:33.113
One hundred percent.

13:33.914 --> 13:37.050
All right.

13:38.886 --> 13:41.154
LARRY:
So did they send her home?

13:41.221 --> 13:43.991
I told you, Larry,
Megan's okay.

13:44.057 --> 13:45.859
Yeah, but this agent
was killed, right?

13:45.926 --> 13:48.128
-Yes.
-Well, I mean...

13:48.195 --> 13:49.362
she's going
to feel responsible.

13:49.429 --> 13:51.398
I was there;
it was clearly not her fault.

13:51.464 --> 13:55.768
But this degree of traumatic
experience would disturb even

13:55.835 --> 13:58.005
the most stable
of Homo sapiens.

13:58.071 --> 13:59.839
This is not even
to take into account

13:59.907 --> 14:01.174
the double X chromosome
situation.

14:01.241 --> 14:02.876
-Situation?
-Yeah?

14:02.943 --> 14:04.744
Women have two X chromosomes.

14:04.811 --> 14:06.579
Men have an X
and a so-called Y.

14:06.646 --> 14:09.149
But I think if you examine it
closely, you'll find, as I have,

14:09.216 --> 14:12.019
that the Y is really just an X
with a piece missing.

14:12.085 --> 14:13.120
Implying what?

14:13.186 --> 14:15.222
Well, since I'm missing
that very piece,

14:15.288 --> 14:17.024
I may not be qualified
to answer,

14:17.090 --> 14:19.192
but I think it has something
to do with, you know,

14:19.259 --> 14:20.793
they're just more sensitive.

14:20.860 --> 14:22.662
Or that they can
bear children.

14:22.729 --> 14:24.531
Yeah, well, that, too, I guess.

14:24.597 --> 14:26.066
Do you think

14:26.133 --> 14:28.301
it's inappropriate if I were
to send her flowers?

14:29.402 --> 14:31.471
This is so odd.

14:31.538 --> 14:32.505
What?

14:32.572 --> 14:33.340
This process

14:33.406 --> 14:37.177
is introducing more artifacts.

14:37.244 --> 14:42.082
Hey, Charlie... steganography.

14:42.149 --> 14:44.284
Stega-who-graphy?

14:44.351 --> 14:45.986
Steganography.

14:46.053 --> 14:47.654
-Hey, Dad, what's going on?
-Hey, Charlie.

14:47.720 --> 14:49.722
I was in the area.

14:49.789 --> 14:51.458
I was having a meeting with
Rolf Peterson, the engineer

14:51.524 --> 14:53.060
for my downtown
mall progect.

14:53.126 --> 14:54.827
You want to...
want to take a look?

14:54.894 --> 14:56.363
Oh, yeah, always.

14:58.865 --> 14:59.933
There you go.

15:00.000 --> 15:01.701
What is this...

15:01.768 --> 15:02.869
steganography?

15:02.936 --> 15:04.337
It's the classic,
you know,

15:04.404 --> 15:06.073
picture hidden
in a picture thing.

15:06.139 --> 15:08.408
Only this is digital
steganography, isn't it?

15:08.475 --> 15:09.209
Yeah.

15:09.276 --> 15:10.410
Where one image
is embedded

15:10.477 --> 15:11.411
in the coding

15:11.478 --> 15:12.345
of another image.

15:12.412 --> 15:13.846
Yeah, it's very hot right now.

15:13.913 --> 15:14.814
The Defense Department

15:14.881 --> 15:16.549
is encrypting satellite imagery.

15:16.616 --> 15:18.518
Oh? How do they do that?

15:18.585 --> 15:19.552
I'll show you.

15:21.521 --> 15:23.957
Simply take a CD,

15:24.024 --> 15:26.960
and I look for the
nearest sharp object.

15:27.027 --> 15:28.962
That'll do.

15:29.029 --> 15:30.663
Why are you ruining the CD?

15:30.730 --> 15:32.932
Now, if I scratch a record,
it would ruin it,

15:33.000 --> 15:34.601
but this CD will still play.

15:34.667 --> 15:36.103
I've created gaps

15:36.169 --> 15:38.105
in its readable data, but...

15:38.171 --> 15:39.939
The software
fills in the gaps,

15:40.007 --> 15:43.143
making educated guesses
as to what it should be,

15:43.210 --> 15:45.578
resulting in complete images
from partial data.

15:45.645 --> 15:46.646
Precisely.

15:46.713 --> 15:48.848
And since we suspect
that there is an image

15:48.915 --> 15:49.983
hidden in this picture...

15:50.050 --> 15:52.419
We try to tell the
computer to look at it

15:52.485 --> 15:53.853
in another way.

15:53.920 --> 15:54.754
I'm going to try

15:54.821 --> 15:58.525
adjusting the pixels
by one more negative power.

15:58.591 --> 16:00.760
LARRY: Okay, and you
can see the edges

16:00.827 --> 16:02.329
-are deteriorating.
-Yeah.

16:03.796 --> 16:05.032
So who's the criminal?

16:05.098 --> 16:06.899
It's some
methamphetamine dealer.

16:06.966 --> 16:09.002
Let's see what this does.

16:09.069 --> 16:11.404
( computer beeping )

16:11.471 --> 16:14.241
ALAN:
She's naked.

16:17.310 --> 16:19.012
Oh, God.

16:29.589 --> 16:30.957
Turn it off.

16:31.024 --> 16:34.794
CHARLIE: I'll take the girl's
image out of the picture

16:34.861 --> 16:36.196
and we can study it for details.

16:36.263 --> 16:37.330
Right, the lab
can deal with that.

16:37.397 --> 16:39.066
Can you tell if this
was sent over the Internet?

16:39.132 --> 16:41.368
Partial data, there's
no way to know.

16:41.434 --> 16:43.203
CHARLIE: The pornographic image
was encrypted

16:43.270 --> 16:46.373
in a photograph of the
house that exploded.

16:46.439 --> 16:48.175
So the photographs could've
been taken by the same camera?

16:48.241 --> 16:51.078
-Maybe.
-LARRY: Not... necessarily.

16:51.144 --> 16:53.113
Which is it?

16:54.013 --> 16:55.282
We really can't be sure.

16:56.816 --> 16:58.718
All right, well, look, we know
the guy was into child porn,

16:58.785 --> 17:01.354
but the photograph could've
been taken even five years ago.

17:01.421 --> 17:03.022
You know what?
I'll make you a copy.

17:03.090 --> 17:06.193
That's all right, give it to me;
our guys will know what to do.

17:06.259 --> 17:08.628
Except they didn't find
this picture, did they?

17:08.695 --> 17:10.197
Well, you can
explain it to them?

17:10.263 --> 17:11.831
Well, you
know what,

17:11.898 --> 17:12.765
I'll keep working on it.

17:12.832 --> 17:15.068
It could be one of hundreds
of photographs on the computer.

17:15.135 --> 17:16.836
Or this child could need
our help right now.

17:16.903 --> 17:17.704
ALAN:
Charlie...

17:17.770 --> 17:19.038
why don't you
let his people pursue it.

17:19.106 --> 17:21.040
-Dad, please. -DON: Yeah, why
don't you let our people

17:21.108 --> 17:21.774
pursue it, all right?

17:21.841 --> 17:23.510
We have an entire unit dedicated

17:23.576 --> 17:25.745
to crimes against children--
wait, hold on.

17:25.812 --> 17:27.347
You got to understand
the reality of crimes like...

17:27.414 --> 17:29.082
Excuse me, I understand
the reality!

17:29.149 --> 17:30.850
I'm gonna go back to, uh...

17:30.917 --> 17:32.185
-Your office.
-Yeah.

17:32.252 --> 17:33.853
DON:
What the hell are you doing?

17:33.920 --> 17:35.122
I need more
than the photograph.

17:35.188 --> 17:36.489
I got to stop a guy
from disappearing

17:36.556 --> 17:38.191
into Mexico!
An agent was killed.

17:38.258 --> 17:39.559
He set off the explosion?

17:39.626 --> 17:40.393
Yes.

17:45.732 --> 17:47.300
Thank you!

17:55.142 --> 17:58.345
Charlie, walk me to my car.

17:58.411 --> 17:59.846
I need to get back to my work.

17:59.912 --> 18:01.114
You need to clear your head.

18:01.948 --> 18:04.217
Walk me to my car.

18:10.890 --> 18:13.826
CHARLIE: There are thousands of
kids in trouble-- I know that.

18:13.893 --> 18:16.829
But, you know, when one
pops up in your face,

18:16.896 --> 18:22.269
sure, it seems reasonable
to at least attempt to...

18:22.335 --> 18:23.836
I know, I know, Charlie
it's terribly disturbing.

18:23.903 --> 18:26.306
-I understand that. -Correct,
so the best thing I can do

18:26.373 --> 18:30.177
is find useful details
to help Don catch this guy

18:30.243 --> 18:31.944
and perhaps locate
this little girl.

18:32.011 --> 18:33.846
Charlie, this is not a
career that you've chosen.

18:33.913 --> 18:35.515
You don't have to
do this, you know.

18:35.582 --> 18:37.049
What are you saying, that I
should just walk away, right?

18:37.116 --> 18:38.885
Dad, what kind of person

18:38.951 --> 18:40.052
would do that?

18:40.119 --> 18:41.188
You wouldn't do that.

18:41.254 --> 18:43.923
This is not
about me, Charlie.

18:43.990 --> 18:47.194
The girl in the picture
reminds me

18:47.260 --> 18:52.465
of a kid I knew...
Jessica Cartman.

18:52.532 --> 18:54.801
Jessica Cartman? You mean
the kid who used to live

18:54.867 --> 18:56.068
two blocks away from us?

18:56.135 --> 18:57.069
Yeah.

18:57.136 --> 18:58.605
Well, what
happened to her?

18:58.671 --> 19:01.574
I don't know, I just always felt
like something was up with her.

19:01.641 --> 19:03.343
Charlie, you were only
a kid at the time.

19:03.410 --> 19:05.245
Right. I'm not anymore.

19:05.312 --> 19:06.746
I got to go.

19:08.548 --> 19:10.483
We know it was encrypted,
we just can't tell

19:10.550 --> 19:12.285
if it was sent
over the Internet.

19:12.352 --> 19:13.286
Yeah, well, this'll

19:13.353 --> 19:15.188
cross-reference her face
against our database

19:15.255 --> 19:16.423
of over a million images

19:16.489 --> 19:18.891
-of exploited kids.
-Did you say a million?

19:18.958 --> 19:19.959
Yeah, and growing.

19:20.026 --> 19:21.027
See, this program

19:21.093 --> 19:24.497
matches facial characteristics
similar to that of a DNA test.

19:24.564 --> 19:26.699
Right.

19:26.766 --> 19:29.369
-( beep )
-Damn, that's too bad.

19:29.436 --> 19:30.637
She's not a known victim.

19:30.703 --> 19:33.206
So, then, what will you do now?
I mean, what happens?

19:33.273 --> 19:35.041
Well, the photo gets analyzed.

19:35.107 --> 19:37.310
We've had some luck matching
beds in the background,

19:37.377 --> 19:38.845
finding repeat locations
that way.

19:38.911 --> 19:39.646
How long, you think?

19:39.712 --> 19:40.913
It's gonna be a few days, man.

19:40.980 --> 19:43.650
We got backlogs, but I'll try to
run it through quick as I can.

19:43.716 --> 19:45.117
Yeah, I appreciate it--
do what you can,

19:45.184 --> 19:46.486
-all right?
-No problem.

19:46.553 --> 19:48.588
MEGAN:
I want to know

19:48.655 --> 19:52.058
if you have property leased
to Derrick Lamberg

19:52.124 --> 19:53.260
in Sonora, Mexico.

19:53.326 --> 19:54.394
He's a fugitive.

19:54.461 --> 19:55.695
Yes, I'll hold.

19:55.762 --> 19:57.564
Excuse me, Charlie,
hold on a second, man.

19:57.630 --> 19:59.499
We just got a hit
on a delivery service.

19:59.566 --> 20:02.068
They picked up nine packages
at the meth house this morning.

20:02.134 --> 20:04.271
-I'll let you know
if it's anything. -That's great.

20:04.337 --> 20:05.705
-Hi.
-What you got?

20:05.772 --> 20:07.540
I was able to
detect a reflection

20:07.607 --> 20:09.141
of what I think
is a man

20:09.208 --> 20:10.477
in the glass
of the window.

20:10.543 --> 20:11.644
How much can you see?

20:11.711 --> 20:14.814
Only an outline, but there's
definitely a presence.

20:14.881 --> 20:17.417
Of course there's
a presence, Charlie,

20:17.484 --> 20:18.818
somebody took the picture.

20:18.885 --> 20:19.719
What else do you have?

20:19.786 --> 20:23.423
I need to work with the Crimes
Against Children office,

20:23.490 --> 20:26.659
show them what I have--

20:26.726 --> 20:29.296
enlargements of
carpet, bed, drapes...

20:29.362 --> 20:30.497
Charlie, I need
something concrete.

20:30.563 --> 20:32.899
This guy is going to skip
to Mexico and game over.

20:32.965 --> 20:33.700
Yes, I understand.

20:33.766 --> 20:36.936
You feel, because
of Agent Gallagher's death...

20:37.003 --> 20:39.171
This isn't about how I feel--
we need

20:39.238 --> 20:40.273
to get this guy,
Charlie.

20:40.340 --> 20:42.409
-Yes, I'm here.
-Anything?

20:42.475 --> 20:45.011
Yes, I have enlargements
from the photograph that...

20:45.077 --> 20:45.845
The chemicals
from the bust

20:45.912 --> 20:47.714
were manufactured
in Sonora, Mexico.

20:47.780 --> 20:49.416
I'm checking to see
if he's leasing

20:49.482 --> 20:51.351
anything there, and I
gave his description

20:51.418 --> 20:52.285
to the Border Patrol...

20:52.352 --> 20:53.786
I know, average white guy--
could be anyone.

20:53.853 --> 20:54.854
Charlie, there's nothing else

20:54.921 --> 20:57.290
-you can do? -As I stated,
I have enlargements

20:57.357 --> 20:58.458
from the photograph.

20:58.525 --> 20:59.692
I'm going to give them

20:59.759 --> 21:01.994
to the Crimes Against
Children squad, okay?

21:02.061 --> 21:04.030
I already handed those off--
give me, come here.

21:04.096 --> 21:05.064
Give me these.

21:05.131 --> 21:06.032
What's going on?

21:06.098 --> 21:08.401
Look, we have a system for
finding these kids.

21:08.468 --> 21:09.602
Just let the system

21:09.669 --> 21:11.037
-do its job.
-Your system's incomplete.

21:11.103 --> 21:13.105
Charlie, give me a break--
it's the best in the world.

21:13.172 --> 21:14.307
What are you talking about?

21:14.374 --> 21:15.508
Complex systems
require redundancy:

21:15.575 --> 21:17.076
computers,
the military,

21:17.143 --> 21:18.878
human brains, but not the FBI?

21:18.945 --> 21:20.847
Why don't you want
me to find this child?

21:20.913 --> 21:22.882
What are you talking about?
That is so unfair.

21:22.949 --> 21:24.451
I want to find the kid
as much as you do,

21:24.517 --> 21:25.852
and I want to find
the perpetrator.

21:25.918 --> 21:28.020
Tell me what's bugging you
so much about this photograph?

21:28.087 --> 21:29.989
This child has shown up in front
of us for a reason.

21:30.056 --> 21:32.492
She may lead us to Lamberg--
even if she doesn't

21:32.559 --> 21:35.027
Don, I need to take action
to find this little girl.

21:35.094 --> 21:37.196
-That's what I'm doing, I'm
taking action. -No, you're not.

21:37.263 --> 21:39.499
-Yes, I am. -You're right
about that delivery service.

21:39.566 --> 21:41.401
We grabbed 20 pounds
of meth and got a hit

21:41.468 --> 21:42.669
on a wire tranfer for Lamberg.

21:42.735 --> 21:44.136
Great, let's get on that.

21:44.203 --> 21:47.006
MAN: They've been missing
since yesterday.

21:47.073 --> 21:48.341
I'm really concerned.

21:48.408 --> 21:50.242
I'd like to file
a report.

21:50.309 --> 21:51.611
Agent Romero?

21:51.678 --> 21:53.913
-Yeah? -I'm Charles Eppes,
Don Eppes' brother.

21:53.980 --> 21:55.648
I'm working on a photograph
that I believe

21:55.715 --> 21:57.350
-he also shared with you.
-Charles, yeah.

21:57.417 --> 21:58.751
Don brought in something
in here earlier.

21:58.818 --> 22:01.821
I have some
enhanced imagery.

22:01.888 --> 22:03.890
I'll put it
in the databese.

22:03.956 --> 22:07.460
What are the chances
we can find this little girl?

22:09.596 --> 22:11.130
Let's go in here.

22:11.197 --> 22:12.198
My wife's an addict.

22:12.264 --> 22:15.101
I'm scared she might be trading
my little girl for drugs.

22:26.145 --> 22:27.079
( banging and clanking )

22:27.146 --> 22:28.080
( door closes )

22:28.147 --> 22:29.315
Charlie?

22:29.382 --> 22:31.083
No. Hey, Dad.
It's me, Don.

22:31.150 --> 22:32.084
( mumbling )

22:32.151 --> 22:33.953
Sorry to wake you.

22:34.020 --> 22:35.154
Where is he?

22:35.221 --> 22:37.524
Oh, I think he's at his office,
working on your case.

22:37.590 --> 22:38.525
Oh, yeah?
Good.

22:38.591 --> 22:40.159
I mean, we've hit
nothing but dead ends

22:40.226 --> 22:41.327
and he doesn't have his head

22:41.394 --> 22:42.361
in the game
at all.

22:42.429 --> 22:43.463
You know
it's 1:00 in the morning?

22:43.530 --> 22:45.097
Yeah, so what, I'm working.

22:45.164 --> 22:46.165
Listen, hard ass,

22:46.232 --> 22:48.267
I know he's got a job
that's he's doing,

22:48.334 --> 22:50.737
I know all
about that...

22:50.803 --> 22:54.173
It's just that this case
is messing with his head.

22:54.240 --> 22:55.775
You know?

22:55.842 --> 22:58.077
It's reminding him of something
that he's feeling guilty about.

22:58.144 --> 22:59.045
Why?

22:59.111 --> 23:01.247
What, did he do something
I don't know about?

23:01.313 --> 23:02.649
No... it's not
what he did,

23:02.715 --> 23:03.750
it's what he didn't do.

23:03.816 --> 23:05.017
He saw this girl, one time,

23:05.084 --> 23:06.519
and she was in
trouble and he...

23:06.586 --> 23:07.520
he didn't save her

23:07.587 --> 23:09.288
I mean, how the
hell could he,

23:09.355 --> 23:10.657
he was a child
at the time.

23:10.723 --> 23:11.724
But, you know,
being Charlie,

23:11.791 --> 23:13.392
he's got a big heart and he...

23:13.460 --> 23:14.794
feels responsible.

23:14.861 --> 23:17.764
And now, to atone,
he's banging his head

23:17.830 --> 23:18.898
against a door
that'll never open.

23:18.965 --> 23:20.667
You're never going to find
this girl, are you?

23:20.733 --> 23:22.535
Well, Dad, you know,
I mean, the odds are against it,

23:22.602 --> 23:23.536
but he's got to learn, you know?

23:23.603 --> 23:24.537
Everyone gets emotional.

23:24.604 --> 23:25.772
You still gotta
do your job.

23:25.838 --> 23:26.873
Listen, Don,
this is a life

23:26.939 --> 23:27.940
that you've chosen
for yourself

23:28.007 --> 23:30.009
I'd rather you not
choose it for Charlie.

23:30.076 --> 23:31.611
What'd you say,
he's at the school?

23:31.678 --> 23:33.145
I couldn't get him
to come home.

23:33.212 --> 23:34.146
Dad, let me explain something.

23:34.213 --> 23:34.981
This guy killed an agent, okay?

23:35.047 --> 23:36.182
We missed catching him
by minutes.

23:36.248 --> 23:37.717
He's on the run,
we don't have a lead.

23:37.784 --> 23:39.819
So, I'm sorry,
but I have to push Charlie.

23:39.886 --> 23:41.253
That's the way it is.

23:41.320 --> 23:42.955
You don't have to push him,
he's doing it.

23:43.022 --> 23:45.224
I've got to go to bed,
I've got an early meeting.

23:45.291 --> 23:46.425
Good night.

23:47.894 --> 23:49.929
LARRY: Rigel is particularly
bright tonight.

23:49.996 --> 23:52.264
Mm.

23:52.331 --> 23:54.233
If he using
advanced coding

23:54.300 --> 23:56.836
to hide his
child pornography,

23:56.903 --> 23:58.538
-then he's a...
-Yeah.

23:58.605 --> 24:01.574
A.) He's an
intelligent pedophile;

24:01.641 --> 24:03.576
B.) He's paranoid;

24:03.643 --> 24:06.579
C.) He's cautious;

24:06.646 --> 24:09.682
D.) He's...

24:09.749 --> 24:11.618
I don't know, what is "D"?

24:11.684 --> 24:14.153
"D" is that he'll apply
these same techniques

24:14.220 --> 24:16.789
to other information
he wants to conceal.

24:18.357 --> 24:19.291
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

24:19.358 --> 24:20.326
I see what you mean.

24:20.392 --> 24:22.995
So, one might
assume a ratio

24:23.062 --> 24:25.998
of most dangerous information
hidden

24:26.065 --> 24:29.836
with most advanced coding,
and...

24:29.902 --> 24:33.506
The entire hard drive's
encrypted.

24:35.141 --> 24:36.509
Or partitioned.

24:38.645 --> 24:40.079
A phantom hard drive.

24:45.017 --> 24:45.952
Larry, come on.

24:46.018 --> 24:46.953
Yeah, yeah.

24:47.019 --> 24:48.688
We gotta get to
the computer lab

24:48.755 --> 24:49.756
as fast as we can.

24:49.822 --> 24:51.490
I know a short cut
through metallurgy.

24:51.558 --> 24:52.692
( typing rapidly )

24:52.759 --> 24:53.693
( computer beeps )

24:53.760 --> 24:55.061
There's only two gig
of storage here.

24:55.127 --> 24:56.495
Yeah, I tried
the FDISK command.

24:56.563 --> 24:58.598
It's rebooting,
I'm guessing.

24:58.665 --> 24:59.932
A second partition, huh?

24:59.999 --> 25:01.768
There's got to be
an executable file

25:01.834 --> 25:03.502
to access
the hidden operating system.

25:03.570 --> 25:04.771
DON:
What's the deal--

25:04.837 --> 25:06.906
there's more people in here
in the middle of the night

25:06.973 --> 25:08.941
than at 10:00 in the morning.
Looks like the FBI.

25:09.008 --> 25:10.309
Yeah, less distracting at night.

25:10.376 --> 25:11.477
Deeper thinking.

25:11.544 --> 25:13.145
Yeah? What are you guys doing?

25:13.212 --> 25:14.647
Trying to follow the logic

25:14.714 --> 25:17.684
of an intelligent,
paranoid pedophile.

25:17.750 --> 25:20.553
Lamberg created
a phantom hard drive.

25:20.620 --> 25:21.554
What do you mean,
it's there,

25:21.621 --> 25:22.555
but you can't find it?

25:22.622 --> 25:23.556
Exactly.

25:23.623 --> 25:24.323
It's a mathematical
illusion,

25:24.390 --> 25:26.192
like the magician's
disappearing trick.

25:29.461 --> 25:30.329
The computer's hard drive

25:30.396 --> 25:32.832
looks perfectly normal
at first glance,

25:32.899 --> 25:34.000
just like the magician's box.

25:37.136 --> 25:39.238
But there's a hidden place--

25:39.305 --> 25:41.207
an unseen, secret compartment.

25:44.110 --> 25:46.378
Lamberg did the same thing
with his computer:

25:46.445 --> 25:49.782
he hid his data
in a separate, secret place.

25:49.849 --> 25:51.217
It's a trick,
you know?

25:51.283 --> 25:52.852
It's a very clever
computer partition trick.

25:52.919 --> 25:55.187
DON: So what do you think,
can you find it?

25:55.254 --> 25:56.689
LARRY:
I think....

25:56.756 --> 25:58.290
I just did.

25:58.357 --> 25:59.425
Okay, here we go.

25:59.491 --> 26:00.927
Hmm, just as
we thought, huh?

26:00.993 --> 26:01.994
All the data's
been encrypted.

26:02.061 --> 26:03.029
DON:
Well, come on, Charlie,

26:03.095 --> 26:04.430
you with all your
NSA experience--

26:04.496 --> 26:05.431
you can't break that?

26:05.497 --> 26:07.199
Wall, this discrete
logarithm

26:07.266 --> 26:08.968
provides quite
an obstacle.

26:09.035 --> 26:10.970
You know what, Larry, that would
really only be a problem

26:11.037 --> 26:12.238
if Lamberg hadn't based
his cryptosystem

26:12.304 --> 26:13.139
on a super-singular curve.

26:13.205 --> 26:14.506
DON: You guys think
he has, what,

26:14.573 --> 26:16.709
like a background in math
or intelligence or something?

26:16.776 --> 26:18.110
Nah, it's downloadable
from the Net;

26:18.177 --> 26:19.679
high school kids are
encrypting files

26:19.746 --> 26:21.313
from their parents'
prying eyes,

26:21.380 --> 26:23.315
even as we speak.

26:24.350 --> 26:25.184
I got it.

26:25.251 --> 26:26.853
Wow, okay.

26:26.919 --> 26:29.021
Some of the data has been
damaged in the explosion,

26:29.088 --> 26:31.423
but there's fragments
we can read.

26:31.490 --> 26:33.292
Our despicable felon is

26:33.359 --> 26:35.962
a proud a member
of...

26:36.028 --> 26:37.630
"The Long Beach Gun Club."

26:37.697 --> 26:38.998
Oh, that's a good lead.
That's great.

26:39.065 --> 26:40.700
Hey, call me if you get
anything else on him.

26:40.767 --> 26:41.734
Yeah, we'll
keep looking.

26:41.801 --> 26:43.602
Loop me in to what you know,
it might help my search.

26:43.670 --> 26:45.437
Hey, Colby, it's me.

26:45.504 --> 26:46.706
Yeah, Long Beach
Gun Club, okay?

26:46.773 --> 26:48.107
Apparently,
Lamberg was a member.

26:48.174 --> 26:49.441
So, wake up whoever
you have to wake up,

26:49.508 --> 26:50.743
get his file, his photo--

26:50.810 --> 26:51.744
anything you can,
all right?

26:51.811 --> 26:52.912
All right, guys, thanks.

26:56.048 --> 26:57.817
LARRY:
Well, I opted for sending Megan

26:57.884 --> 26:59.318
seven aromatic
white tuberoses--

26:59.385 --> 27:01.821
anonymously.

27:01.888 --> 27:04.090
Well, what good is it
if she doesn't know it's you?

27:04.156 --> 27:05.324
Well, I'm a physicist,
Charles.

27:05.391 --> 27:06.492
I believe she'll
still feel

27:06.558 --> 27:09.161
the cloud of virtual
possibilities surrounding her,

27:09.228 --> 27:12.031
even as she's not yet
identified the particle.

27:12.098 --> 27:13.232
Are you talking
about "vibes?"

27:13.299 --> 27:16.168
Yeah, well, somewhat
crudely put, but...

27:16.235 --> 27:17.436
( ringing )

27:17.503 --> 27:18.470
Oh, wait.

27:18.537 --> 27:19.638
Yeah, that's
my fax machine.

27:19.706 --> 27:21.774
I asked Don to send me
Lamberg's photo.

27:21.841 --> 27:23.976
Curiosity--
not great for cats,

27:24.043 --> 27:26.345
but very good
for scientists.

27:35.688 --> 27:36.956
You know,
I've seen this guy.

27:37.023 --> 27:39.859
Is that the
infamous Lamberg, huh?

27:39.926 --> 27:41.193
Mm.

27:47.599 --> 27:49.268
He was just in the FBI office.

27:56.342 --> 27:57.076
I don't understand.

27:57.143 --> 27:58.845
You're saying Lamberg was here?

27:58.911 --> 28:00.412
He was in the Crimes
Against Children Office.

28:00.479 --> 28:02.849
Charlie, it doesn't make
any sense, he's a fugitive.

28:02.915 --> 28:04.717
I mean, why would he do that?

28:04.784 --> 28:05.684
I saw him in Romero's office.

28:05.752 --> 28:06.986
He was there.

28:07.053 --> 28:07.887
( sighing ):
All right, I'll check it out.

28:07.954 --> 28:08.888
I'll get back to you.

28:08.955 --> 28:10.589
You're not going
to believe this.

28:10.656 --> 28:12.358
Charlie says Lamberg was here.

28:12.424 --> 28:13.159
What do you mean, here?

28:13.225 --> 28:14.493
In the building.
It's crazy.

28:14.560 --> 28:15.594
Why would he in the building?

28:15.661 --> 28:16.829
In the Crimes Against
Children Office.

28:16.896 --> 28:17.830
So why don't you
check their records

28:17.897 --> 28:19.498
for any white males
who may have made

28:19.565 --> 28:20.900
a statement,
or a complaint...

28:20.967 --> 28:22.368
I mean, maybe they left
a contact number.

28:22.434 --> 28:24.003
I'm going to check
the surveillance tapes

28:24.070 --> 28:25.104
-in and out of the building.
-Okay.

28:25.171 --> 28:27.339
Are you're sure
it was him?

28:27.406 --> 28:28.875
CHARLIE:
Infinity.

28:28.941 --> 28:30.076
It's the same guy.

28:30.877 --> 28:32.011
Aristotle said

28:32.078 --> 28:35.114
that infinity is
the lack of limitation.

28:35.181 --> 28:37.016
LARRY:
Which, I suppose,

28:37.083 --> 28:39.351
could be a definition of evil.

28:47.659 --> 28:48.961
David talked to an agent

28:49.028 --> 28:50.596
in the Crimes Against
Children Office--

28:50.662 --> 28:52.364
Charlie was right,
she's linked.

28:52.431 --> 28:54.566
It's the same girl.

28:54.633 --> 28:55.902
What, so, Lamberg goes in there

28:55.968 --> 28:57.503
and files a complaint
under an alias

28:57.569 --> 28:58.504
against his ex-wife?

28:58.570 --> 28:59.571
Claims she stole the daughter?

28:59.638 --> 29:02.241
He's working a scam
to get us to find the girl.

29:02.308 --> 29:04.443
He even left a cell phone
where he can be reached,

29:04.510 --> 29:07.814
which David traced to
the Weber Motel on Hoover.

29:07.880 --> 29:10.582
All right, well, what are
the chances he's still there?

29:10.649 --> 29:13.652
A pedophile obsessed with his
prey won't leave without her.

29:13.719 --> 29:15.154
This is
Lamberg's weakness.

29:15.221 --> 29:17.056
He's going to sit
and wait for that call

29:17.123 --> 29:18.825
telling him
that we found her,

29:18.891 --> 29:20.192
and then he's going to show up

29:20.259 --> 29:21.861
and "save" her
from an abusive mother.

29:21.928 --> 29:23.429
And if nobody knows
what he looks like,

29:23.495 --> 29:25.397
he just comes across
as another distraught dad.

29:25.464 --> 29:27.800
Gets the girl,
he skips to Mexico.

29:27.867 --> 29:29.401
This guy's got some set on him.

29:29.468 --> 29:31.270
You all right?

29:31.337 --> 29:32.872
You up for this?

29:32.939 --> 29:34.173
Oh, yeah.

29:49.488 --> 29:50.823
Hey, are you the cops?

29:50.890 --> 29:52.424
FBI. Do you work here?

29:52.491 --> 29:53.592
Yeah, I'm
the manager.

29:53.659 --> 29:54.861
You guys are Feds?

29:54.927 --> 29:55.862
That's right.

29:55.928 --> 29:57.296
And you're here
about my truck?

29:57.363 --> 29:58.397
Your truck?

29:58.464 --> 30:01.167
Yeah, it got stole
about 30 minutes ago.

30:01.233 --> 30:03.569
No, we're not here
about your truck, sorry.

30:03.635 --> 30:04.670
Have you seen this man?

30:04.736 --> 30:06.105
Oh, yeah,
he came in earlier,

30:06.172 --> 30:07.006
looking for
his daughter.

30:07.073 --> 30:08.607
Wait, she's here?

30:08.674 --> 30:09.976
No, not no more, she ain't.

30:10.042 --> 30:11.543
He took her?

30:11.610 --> 30:13.445
-Who?
-This man.

30:13.512 --> 30:14.413
No, no, no, no.

30:14.480 --> 30:16.715
He came in,
asked for the room number,

30:16.782 --> 30:17.716
and next thing I know,

30:17.783 --> 30:18.750
I see my truck
driving away.

30:18.817 --> 30:19.986
So this guy
stole your truck?

30:20.052 --> 30:21.287
No, the woman did.

30:21.353 --> 30:22.088
Crazy bitch.

30:22.154 --> 30:24.490
She must have seen him
in the office.

30:24.556 --> 30:25.624
Where is he now?

30:25.691 --> 30:27.559
I guess he took off after her.

30:27.626 --> 30:28.961
What was he driving?

30:29.028 --> 30:31.030
A new BMW, very slick.

30:31.097 --> 30:33.032
Let's put out an APB
and tell them

30:33.099 --> 30:35.067
that they should be looking
for-- what color is his car?

30:35.134 --> 30:36.735
-Blue. -Blue-- if be hasn't
caught her already,

30:36.802 --> 30:37.904
-he'll be following her.
-Got it.

30:37.970 --> 30:39.105
Will you show me the room

30:39.171 --> 30:40.639
where the mother
and the daughter were staying?

30:40.706 --> 30:43.309
Oh, that's...

31:00.459 --> 31:01.627
I don't understand.

31:01.693 --> 31:03.162
What was he doing
in this office?

31:03.229 --> 31:05.631
He was using the FBI
to help him find his daughter.

31:05.697 --> 31:06.798
She's his daugther?

31:06.865 --> 31:09.835
Unfortunately, it's not that
uncommon for an abusive parent

31:09.902 --> 31:12.271
to accuse the innocent parent,
and then use the authorities

31:12.338 --> 31:14.006
to help track
down the child.

31:14.073 --> 31:15.007
Her name's Libby.

31:15.074 --> 31:16.275
He was here filing a complaint

31:16.342 --> 31:18.377
against his ex-wife,
a woman named

31:18.444 --> 31:19.778
Michelle Collins.

31:19.845 --> 31:20.879
Well, I found fragments

31:20.947 --> 31:22.748
from dozens of e-mails
he sent to her--

31:22.814 --> 31:24.050
to Libby.

31:24.116 --> 31:25.384
Let me see.

31:27.586 --> 31:29.421
Hey, where's this?

31:29.488 --> 31:30.556
This stuffed animal is

31:30.622 --> 31:32.658
from the other picture.
Where'd you find this?

31:32.724 --> 31:33.692
The motel.

31:33.759 --> 31:34.726
DON:
She was on the run

31:34.793 --> 31:36.929
with her daughter, presumably
to get away from Lamberg.

31:36.996 --> 31:38.664
I tried to tell you
she needed our help.

31:38.730 --> 31:40.499
-Yeah, Charlie, look...
-Didn't I tell you that?

31:40.566 --> 31:42.768
And I told you there's more
at stake than just her.

31:42.834 --> 31:43.569
I got a dead agent

31:43.635 --> 31:45.204
and a guy who's putting
millions of dollars

31:45.271 --> 31:47.506
worth of the worst drug in
years out on the street!

31:47.573 --> 31:49.241
I want to find her
as much as you,

31:49.308 --> 31:50.576
but I'm tired of this!

31:50.642 --> 31:51.978
Okay, guys, looking
at these e-mails,

31:52.044 --> 31:53.079
he's totally obsessed with her.

31:53.145 --> 31:54.180
He's not gonna leave
without her.

31:54.246 --> 31:55.948
CHARLIE:
Well, then we've got to find her

31:56.015 --> 31:57.583
before he does.
What can I do?

31:57.649 --> 31:58.517
I'll let you know.

31:58.584 --> 31:59.551
I have to do something.

31:59.618 --> 32:00.352
Hey, check this out.

32:00.419 --> 32:01.553
It's the stolen truck.

32:02.621 --> 32:03.755
We need to call LAPD.

32:03.822 --> 32:06.658
We need them to tell them
to look for Lamberg's blue BMW.

32:06.725 --> 32:07.793
You get out there.

32:07.859 --> 32:09.428
I'll call LAPD.
Hey, Charlie...

32:09.495 --> 32:10.429
What?

32:10.496 --> 32:11.297
Stay here.

32:13.032 --> 32:15.034
( sirens wailing )

32:16.335 --> 32:18.604
( tires squealing )

32:20.439 --> 32:22.874
OFFICER ( on P.A. ):
Michelle Collins.

32:22.941 --> 32:24.710
The road is a dead end.

32:24.776 --> 32:26.312
Get out with your hands up.

32:28.680 --> 32:30.082
OFFICER: Get your hands
off the wheel and step out

32:30.149 --> 32:30.882
of your truck!

32:30.949 --> 32:32.718
Don't shoot us!

32:32.784 --> 32:34.220
My child's in the car!

32:34.286 --> 32:35.821
What are you doing?

32:35.887 --> 32:36.855
Suspect's got our missing girl.

32:36.922 --> 32:37.923
Suspect?

32:37.990 --> 32:40.126
Michelle Collins. She's wanted
for parental kidnapping charges

32:40.192 --> 32:41.127
and drug trafficking.

32:41.193 --> 32:42.228
That's Lamberg's wife.

32:42.294 --> 32:43.429
Where's the other car?

32:43.495 --> 32:45.431
The blue BMW?

32:46.465 --> 32:47.733
Lamberg killed an FBI agent.

32:47.799 --> 32:49.168
Your suspect is a victim!

32:49.235 --> 32:50.169
Hey, lower your weapons.

32:50.236 --> 32:51.270
DAVID:
We called it in.

32:51.337 --> 32:52.738
Nobody in your office
notified you?

32:52.804 --> 32:53.839
No, we're working on a tip.

32:53.905 --> 32:54.840
That's Lamberg.

32:54.906 --> 32:55.941
Romero, he's been using you

32:56.008 --> 32:57.143
to help him find his daughter.

32:57.209 --> 32:58.610
Turns out this guy's
a pedophile.

33:01.347 --> 33:03.149
-Are you okay?
-MICHELLE: He was chasing us.

33:03.215 --> 33:05.017
I'm sorry, you can
put your hands down.

33:05.084 --> 33:07.619
Come out of the car.

33:07.686 --> 33:09.255
Oh, you must be Libby.

33:09.321 --> 33:11.857
It's okay, honey,
it's safe now.

33:11.923 --> 33:13.425
Oh, yeah.

33:13.492 --> 33:15.494
Come out with me and Mommy.

33:15.561 --> 33:19.165
Oh, and you had to come out
of the house in your pajamas.

33:19.231 --> 33:21.400
Let's get you a blanket.

33:21.467 --> 33:22.768
Here with Mommy.

33:22.834 --> 33:24.203
Thanks.

33:24.270 --> 33:27.173
Come on up to our car.

33:27.239 --> 33:28.607
If Lamberg knows we
have his daughter,

33:28.674 --> 33:31.177
-there's no reason
for him to stay. -No.

33:31.243 --> 33:32.478
He's gone.

33:36.582 --> 33:38.417
MEGAN:
He's got to get rid of that car.

33:38.484 --> 33:40.286
He can buy one,
he can steal one.

33:40.352 --> 33:42.288
Guy like this wants to
move faster, you know?

33:42.354 --> 33:44.156
He wants to be
more invisible.

33:44.223 --> 33:46.292
I mean, we've got
agents at every airport.

33:46.358 --> 33:48.794
Yeah, but LAX has
all that heavy security.

33:48.860 --> 33:50.096
Maybe Ontario.

33:50.162 --> 33:51.763
Union Station.

33:51.830 --> 33:53.165
In one of his e-mails,

33:53.232 --> 33:55.567
he talked to Libby
about train rides.

33:55.634 --> 33:57.069
-I'll go.
-No, come on, Megan.

33:57.136 --> 33:58.270
You haven't had a break.

33:58.337 --> 33:59.271
You haven't had any sleep.

33:59.338 --> 34:00.506
Nobody's had any sleep.

34:01.240 --> 34:02.908
I'll take Colby.

34:02.974 --> 34:03.709
All right.

34:11.550 --> 34:14.019
You know, I didn't mean to imply
earlier that you weren't

34:14.086 --> 34:15.687
doing everything you could
for this child.

34:15.754 --> 34:16.488
You should go home, too.

34:16.555 --> 34:18.590
We haven't caught him yet.

34:18.657 --> 34:23.362
MICHELLE: I walked in on Derrick
messing with Libby,

34:23.429 --> 34:27.466
and I knew I had to get
my act together.

34:27.533 --> 34:29.435
He tried to offer me
more drugs, you know,

34:29.501 --> 34:31.803
-to shut me up.
-Hey.

34:31.870 --> 34:35.574
But I ran away, me and Lib.

34:35.641 --> 34:38.610
-The mother's not stable.
-Mm-hmm.

34:38.677 --> 34:41.580
She's only been off meth
for three weeks.

34:41.647 --> 34:44.350
I don't think that we can
leave the girl in her custody.

34:44.416 --> 34:45.351
DON:
Okay, wait, hold on.

34:45.417 --> 34:46.385
You know, I think she

34:46.452 --> 34:48.220
made a pretty heroic effort
for that kid.

34:48.287 --> 34:49.955
-I understand that, Don...
-Where else

34:50.021 --> 34:50.956
can she go?

34:51.022 --> 34:52.224
Foster care.

34:52.291 --> 34:53.725
-Ah, no.
-I don't know.

34:53.792 --> 34:56.828
She tried to save her kid.

34:56.895 --> 34:58.330
That has to count for something.

34:58.397 --> 34:59.965
Didn't your office seize

35:00.031 --> 35:00.799
most of Lamberg's assets?

35:00.866 --> 35:02.734
-Yeah, I filed the order myself.
-Why can't

35:02.801 --> 35:04.470
the U.S. Attorney's office
use those assets

35:04.536 --> 35:06.004
to help his kid,
help them both

35:06.071 --> 35:08.607
-get on their feet? -If we
can prove he abused her...

35:08.674 --> 35:09.408
He had pictures

35:09.475 --> 35:10.642
of her on his computer.

35:10.709 --> 35:12.478
Come on, her bedroom
was in a superlab.

35:12.544 --> 35:14.246
I mean, they test
her, we're gonna find

35:14.313 --> 35:15.514
traces of meth in her blood,

35:15.581 --> 35:17.816
-in her hair.
-Okay, let me talk to her.

35:17.883 --> 35:18.517
Please.

35:25.457 --> 35:28.527
( strumming guitar )

35:28.594 --> 35:31.530
( woman speaking
indistinctly over P.A. system )

35:37.203 --> 35:39.705
Colby, what do you got?

35:39.771 --> 35:40.706
Nothing yet.

35:40.772 --> 35:41.873
Why, you see anything?

35:41.940 --> 35:42.908
Not yet.

35:42.974 --> 35:46.745
Yeah, I'm starting to think
maybe the airport.

35:51.817 --> 35:55.487
Just keep looking.

36:04.095 --> 36:05.431
Where's my mom?

36:05.497 --> 36:07.633
NADINE:
She's just right next door.

36:09.601 --> 36:13.138
So your dad never touched you?

36:13.205 --> 36:16.141
No.

36:16.208 --> 36:18.410
He never hurt you?

36:18.477 --> 36:21.547
No. Stop asking me.

36:21.613 --> 36:22.914
See how her eyes flicker and

36:22.981 --> 36:24.082
she looks to the right?

36:24.149 --> 36:25.251
She's lying.

36:26.552 --> 36:27.753
NADINE:
We want to stop him

36:27.819 --> 36:31.323
from hurting you, Libby,
or anybody else.

36:31.390 --> 36:34.226
Are you afraid of him?

36:35.894 --> 36:37.596
Look, you don't
have to say anything.

36:37.663 --> 36:41.933
Just... you can nod
your head yes or no.

36:42.000 --> 36:45.837
Are you scared of him?

36:45.904 --> 36:46.838
Yeah.

36:46.905 --> 36:48.173
Okay.

36:48.240 --> 36:49.908
What about your mom?

36:49.975 --> 36:51.677
Are you scared of her?

36:51.743 --> 36:53.412
No.

36:54.846 --> 36:57.949
Can I see her now?

36:58.016 --> 36:59.518
Sure.

37:02.020 --> 37:03.555
This can be overcome, right?

37:05.056 --> 37:07.793
It's possible for this child
to grow up to live

37:07.859 --> 37:08.894
a normal life?

37:08.960 --> 37:11.697
We're doing everything we can
to help her, right?

37:38.056 --> 37:38.990
He just got up.

37:39.057 --> 37:40.526
Tan cap, sunglasses.

37:40.592 --> 37:42.260
He's walking towards me.

37:43.929 --> 37:45.431
I got him.

37:53.639 --> 37:55.474
Hey, buddy, you got a light?

37:56.875 --> 37:58.744
I said, you got
a light, Derrick?

37:59.611 --> 38:02.681
Get on your knees, bitch!

38:02.748 --> 38:04.650
COLBY: Put your hands
behind your head.

38:04.716 --> 38:06.251
-What's happening?
-Is everything all right?

38:06.318 --> 38:07.252
FBI, it's okay.

38:07.319 --> 38:07.919
What's going on?

38:07.986 --> 38:08.620
Shut up!

38:10.322 --> 38:12.324
There's been some mistake.

38:12.391 --> 38:15.193
Yeah, I should've
put one in your head

38:15.260 --> 38:16.795
while I had the chance.

38:16.862 --> 38:17.829
Please stand up.

38:21.199 --> 38:22.868
Hey, we got him.

38:22.934 --> 38:24.836
-You sure? -Yeah, they're
bringing him in now.

38:24.903 --> 38:27.339
You were right, he
was at Union Station

38:27.406 --> 38:28.540
with a ticket to San Diego.

38:28.607 --> 38:30.241
He was gonna just walk
across the border,

38:30.308 --> 38:31.276
right out in the open.

38:31.343 --> 38:32.811
There he is now.
Hey, guys.

38:32.878 --> 38:34.380
MEGAN:
Hey.

38:35.514 --> 38:36.515
Good job.

38:38.417 --> 38:40.386
I want my lawyer, immediately.

38:42.354 --> 38:43.755
Take him to room one.

38:46.257 --> 38:50.228
Hey, hey!

38:50.295 --> 38:53.999
Come on, Charlie, I'll
give you a ride home.

38:54.065 --> 38:55.000
Come on.

38:57.135 --> 38:58.437
See ya.

39:01.807 --> 39:04.275
You need to get some
food in you, Charlie,

39:04.342 --> 39:05.711
and some sleep.

39:05.777 --> 39:08.614
You've been up for 36 hours.

39:10.516 --> 39:14.620
You ever want to kill somebody?

39:14.686 --> 39:16.888
A couple of times.

39:16.955 --> 39:20.291
Like today.

39:20.358 --> 39:25.063
There was this girl in my
neighborhood, when I was a kid.

39:25.130 --> 39:26.231
Jessica.

39:26.297 --> 39:29.100
She never said
anything about it,

39:29.167 --> 39:30.669
but I knew.

39:30.736 --> 39:33.772
I could tell by watching her
with her father--

39:33.839 --> 39:37.308
the way he would keep his hand
on her shoulder.

39:37.375 --> 39:38.410
She hated it.

39:38.477 --> 39:41.480
And she looked at me.

39:41.547 --> 39:45.517
And I knew, and I never
did anything about it.

39:45.584 --> 39:47.118
Can you believe that?

39:47.185 --> 39:48.119
Yeah.

39:48.186 --> 39:50.556
You were just a kid, Charlie.

39:50.622 --> 39:53.859
Doesn't matter. I knew.

39:55.694 --> 39:57.496
You would've done something.

39:57.563 --> 39:59.531
I didn't.

39:59.598 --> 40:01.399
I don't know
what I would've done,

40:01.467 --> 40:04.636
or what Don would've done.

40:04.703 --> 40:06.171
No one ever knows
what they're gonna do

40:06.237 --> 40:08.273
in a situation
until they're there.

40:08.339 --> 40:13.044
I know I did nothing.

40:13.111 --> 40:15.113
Well, why don't you
do something now?

40:15.180 --> 40:18.684
Why don't you find Jessica
and see how she's doing?

40:20.552 --> 40:23.421
I could do that.

40:23.489 --> 40:26.124
Sleep on it first, though.

40:26.191 --> 40:29.260
Mm, I'll go talk to her.

40:29.327 --> 40:30.295
Yeah.

40:30.361 --> 40:33.198
That's an action I can take.

40:33.264 --> 40:36.367
Thank you.

40:36.434 --> 40:38.036
How do you deal
with this stuff?

40:40.506 --> 40:42.541
( sighs )

40:42.608 --> 40:44.175
We did a good thing today.

40:46.978 --> 40:48.880
We did a good thing.
