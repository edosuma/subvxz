Captain Cruz is correct.

Maybe after your prese--

06:31.652 --> 06:33.741

06:39.355 --> 06:42.010

this is just how Gideon decided

07:11.735 --> 07:13.041
to remember me for some reason.

07:13.084 --> 07:14.564
But I don't mind--I mean,
everything sounds better

07:14.608 --> 07:16.000

07:16.044 --> 07:17.349

07:17.393 --> 07:20.744
- So you're a memory?
- The last remaining.

07:20.788 --> 07:22.616
I spent so much time
working on Gideon

07:22.659 --> 07:25.575
that I must've been protected
here in her subconscious.

07:25.619 --> 07:26.968
Now, I mean,
I can't say the same

07:27.011 --> 07:28.622

but--

07:28.665 --> 07:30.972
- Look what you did to her.
- Me?

07:31.015 --> 07:32.843
You are the one
who forced the decision on her.

07:32.887 --> 07:34.497
Clearly, she couldn't
handle it.

07:34.541 --> 07:35.846
We're in a hurry, can you just

07:35.890 --> 07:37.195
get her up and running
and then--

07:37.239 --> 07:39.284
- Uh, not so simple.

07:39.328 --> 07:41.069
Um, you see this?

07:41.112 --> 07:42.679
This is her prefrontal cortex,

07:42.723 --> 07:44.638
and it houses
all of her short-term memories,

07:44.681 --> 07:48.729
and as you can see, hers has
been completely wiped.

07:48.772 --> 07:51.732
And this is the subconscious.
That's where we are.

07:51.775 --> 07:53.516
It's kind of like a stronghold.

07:53.560 --> 07:55.126
It's buried so deep it was able

07:55.170 --> 07:57.694
to be protected
when she melted down.

07:57.738 --> 07:59.740
- What's--what's going on here?

07:59.783 --> 08:01.916
- That is Gideon's
long-term memories.

08:01.959 --> 08:03.657
Now, while everything else
was being erased,

08:03.700 --> 08:06.311
she was able to hold on
to a few moments.

08:06.355 --> 08:09.445
Problem is, she can't
access them on her own.

08:09.489 --> 08:13.580
- All right, well, what happens
if you just wake her up?

08:13.623 --> 08:16.234
- Without her memories. Heh.

08:16.278 --> 08:18.193
Well, it would be
like a factory reset.

08:18.236 --> 08:21.109
She'd be back to who she was
before she knew any of us.

08:21.152 --> 08:22.719
- But she'd still be
a supercomputer.

08:22.763 --> 08:24.895
- Well, sure, she'd have
her basic functions

08:24.939 --> 08:26.984
and her knowledge
of the timeline,

08:27.028 --> 08:28.899
and that's all built-in,
but her personality--

08:28.943 --> 08:30.553
- So she'd have all
the information,

08:30.597 --> 08:32.033
but none of
the annoying human bits?

08:32.076 --> 08:33.600
That's perfect. Let's do it.

08:33.643 --> 08:35.166
- No. No. Don't do it.

08:35.210 --> 08:36.603
- We have to get out of here,
Spooner.

08:36.646 --> 08:37.995
We have to save the team.

08:38.039 --> 08:40.781
- Not without Gideon.
Our Gideon.

08:43.610 --> 08:44.959
How do we bring her back?

08:45.002 --> 08:46.743
- Well, these key memories
are all we've got.

08:46.787 --> 08:50.225
So I guess the only place
to start is helping her

08:50.268 --> 08:54.055
access those
by visiting them with her.

08:54.098 --> 08:56.536
- So you're gonna send us
inside Gideon's head,

08:56.579 --> 08:58.886
even though we're already
inside Gideon's head.

08:58.929 --> 09:00.235
- Yeah.
- There's a reason

09:00.278 --> 09:01.758
why I skip
Christopher Nolan movies.

09:01.802 --> 09:02.759
Let's just not
overthink things.

09:02.803 --> 09:04.021
- Yeah, okay.

09:04.065 --> 09:05.632
Just tell us
what you need us to do.

09:05.675 --> 09:10.071
- Well, I would suggest that
we start with a recent memory.

09:10.114 --> 09:12.290
This one is from a year ago.

09:12.334 --> 09:14.249
Right, I'd suggest that
you hold on to something.

09:14.292 --> 09:18.166
- Wait!

09:18.209 --> 09:20.560
- What?

09:20.603 --> 09:22.605
Is that me? What?

09:22.649 --> 09:24.999
What the hell?
Now I'm in a coma?

09:25.042 --> 09:26.827

09:26.870 --> 09:28.698

shot her with</i>

09:53.854 --> 09:55.682
<i>should wear off at any moment.</i>

09:55.725 --> 09:57.161
- Come on, Gideon.

09:57.205 --> 09:59.555
There must be a reason
you held on to this one.

09:59.599 --> 10:00.861
Remember.

10:04.691 --> 10:06.388
- I remember what happened now.

10:07.781 --> 10:10.610
Would you like me to administer
additional sedation?

10:10.653 --> 10:12.046
-

10:12.089 --> 10:13.656
Honestly, Gideon,
I don't know what I'm doing.

10:13.700 --> 10:15.266
Kidnapping people from history,

10:15.310 --> 10:18.269
it goes against everything
I was ever taught.

10:18.313 --> 10:20.228

I'm just grasping at straws,

10:23.840 --> 10:27.017
but this might be
the last straw.

10:27.061 --> 10:28.584
- And I didn't want to say
anything,

10:28.628 --> 10:30.804
but the odds that
a paranoid alien enthusiast

10:30.847 --> 10:32.327
with a love of firearms...

10:32.370 --> 10:33.894
- Yes, I know
what the odds are, Gideon.

10:33.937 --> 10:36.244
But if there's a one
in a billion chance

10:36.287 --> 10:37.724
that this person
can help me find Sara,

10:37.767 --> 10:39.203
I have to take it.

10:39.247 --> 10:40.552
And I know it doesn't
make any sense,

10:40.596 --> 10:43.120
but love isn't logical.

10:46.428 --> 10:49.083
- I actually understand.

10:49.126 --> 10:50.693
- You do?

10:50.737 --> 10:52.695
- I really miss Sara too.

10:54.871 --> 10:58.832
- Stop it, Gideon.
You're gonna make me cry.

10:58.875 --> 11:00.442
Thanks, Gideon.

11:00.485 --> 11:02.662
Let's wake her up, huh?

11:07.318 --> 11:08.842
- Gideon.

11:08.885 --> 11:11.801
- Ms. Cruz. Ms. Logue.
You're here.

11:11.845 --> 11:12.759
- You remember us.

11:12.802 --> 11:14.325
- I safeguarded that memory

11:14.369 --> 11:16.110
because it's when
Captain Sharpe convinced me

11:16.153 --> 11:19.156
to prioritize love over logic,
which is how I met you.

11:19.200 --> 11:22.464
- Hey, guys, when you accessed
her key memory,

11:22.507 --> 11:25.510
the other memories
around it started repopulating.

11:25.554 --> 11:26.773
-
Oh!

11:26.816 --> 11:28.426
- Hey, Jax. You fancy a cuppa?

11:28.470 --> 11:30.037
- Always time for a cuppa,
Gideon.

11:30.080 --> 11:32.735
- Now is clearly not
the time for tea.

11:32.779 --> 11:35.825
Can we get out of here?
- Well, not yet. Not exactly.

11:35.869 --> 11:37.609
You only got one key memory.

11:37.653 --> 11:40.090
You still have
to recover the others.

11:40.134 --> 11:43.006
- The others. Right.

11:43.050 --> 11:44.965
I held onto these memories
because of the moments

11:45.008 --> 11:46.880
that made me who I am.

11:46.923 --> 11:48.577
I still can't recall
what's in them.

11:48.620 --> 11:49.970
- Well, if you do want
to restore them,

11:50.013 --> 11:51.406
you're gonna have to go back.

11:51.449 --> 11:54.931
You're all going to have
to go way back.

11:54.975 --> 11:56.759
Get ready to meet the OGs.

11:59.806 --> 12:00.763
<i>♪</i>

12:02.460 --> 12:03.810
- Oh, breakfast.

12:03.853 --> 12:06.334
The most important meal
of the day.

12:11.121 --> 12:13.341
- Mmm, just how I like 'em.
Poached.

12:13.384 --> 12:14.777
- Those are mine.

12:14.821 --> 12:18.868
- Did I mention I'm a thief?
- No time for breakfast.

12:18.912 --> 12:20.261
- What the hell?

12:20.304 --> 12:24.265
- We must avenge the death
of my son and Rip's son.

12:24.308 --> 12:25.440
I think.

12:25.483 --> 12:28.791
- Which one of you threw that?
Huh? You?

12:28.835 --> 12:29.792
- Who are these guys?

12:29.836 --> 12:31.185
- Wish I knew.

12:31.228 --> 12:32.621
- And what is Sara wearing?

12:32.664 --> 12:34.449
- Oh, you got some egg
on your suit.

12:34.492 --> 12:36.451
- White suede?
That's gonna stain.

12:36.494 --> 12:38.192
- Let me just dab
some soda water.

12:38.235 --> 12:40.890
- If you dab me,
I will break your arm.

12:40.934 --> 12:43.197
- Captain had a real attitude
back in the day.

12:43.240 --> 12:45.808
- Go easy on the Ken doll.

12:45.852 --> 12:49.769
- It's Big Bird's fault.

12:49.812 --> 12:50.813
- Big Bird?

12:50.857 --> 12:52.510
- Sticks and stones.

12:54.643 --> 12:56.863
- You're almost
at the key memory.

12:56.906 --> 12:58.603
Time to do your thing, Gideon.

12:58.647 --> 12:59.953
- Seriously, guys.

12:59.996 --> 13:01.693
How are we ever gonna
defeat Vandal Savage

13:01.737 --> 13:03.130
if we can't even get
through breakfast

13:03.173 --> 13:04.696
without killing each other?

13:04.740 --> 13:06.829
- Hey, come on, let them fight,
boy scout.

13:08.570 --> 13:09.963
- Boy scout?

13:10.006 --> 13:11.051
Don't make me shrink you.

13:11.094 --> 13:13.314
- Come on, Raymond!

13:13.357 --> 13:15.533
- I remember these nutters now.

13:17.274 --> 13:19.363
Put your weapons down
or I'll open an airlock

13:19.407 --> 13:22.149
and blast you all into
the Temporal Zone, understood?

13:23.585 --> 13:26.370
- Yes, ma'am.
- Won't happen again.

13:27.589 --> 13:31.071
- I got to say, Gideon,
you run a tight ship.

13:31.114 --> 13:32.855
- Oh, that's
Captain Hunter's job.

13:32.899 --> 13:34.074
I'm not in charge here.

13:34.117 --> 13:36.598
- Guy's got his work
cut out for him.

13:36.641 --> 13:39.427
I don't know why you choose
to captain a team like this.

13:42.952 --> 13:45.999
- Ah.
- I remember them all now.

13:46.042 --> 13:49.350
Hawkman. Vandal Savage.

13:49.393 --> 13:51.526
- You sure that's a good thing?

13:51.569 --> 13:53.658
- I know the Legends
can be a batty bunch,

13:53.702 --> 13:57.184
but they're my friends.

13:57.227 --> 13:58.925
And I wouldn't be me
without them.

14:00.230 --> 14:02.754
Jax, can we see another?

14:02.798 --> 14:04.104

14:04.147 --> 14:05.888
Oh, you're gonna enjoy this.

The Legends are lucky.

16:50.313 --> 16:51.923
At least they're gonna die.

16:51.967 --> 16:54.317
We are stuck in your stupid
brain forever.

- Look, it ain't
Gideon's fault.

16:56.363 --> 16:59.148
Okay, not this Gideon.
Blue Gideon's a big old bitch.

16:59.192 --> 17:00.671

17:00.715 --> 17:02.151
The countryside,
the sun in my eyes,

17:02.195 --> 17:03.674
the smell of rhubarb.

17:03.718 --> 17:05.459
You told me to decide,
but there was no right answer,

17:05.502 --> 17:07.809
and it was like I was being
pulled in every direction.

17:07.852 --> 17:10.855

When she attacked.

17:10.899 --> 17:12.074
- What are you doing?

17:12.118 --> 17:13.423
- Just because we are stuck
in her brain

17:13.467 --> 17:15.121
doesn't mean
I can't pickle mine.

17:18.428 --> 17:20.256
- I recall during this memory
that Dr. Palmer

17:20.300 --> 17:22.302
had replaced all the ship's
alcohol with kombucha.

17:24.521 --> 17:28.917
- Astra, I am not dying
in Gideon's brain!

17:28.960 --> 17:31.180
- Wait!

17:31.224 --> 17:33.008
I know how to get us
out of here.

17:33.052 --> 17:34.618
- How?
- It's easy.

17:34.662 --> 17:38.144
What we need is to summon a bit
of Dr. Palmer's ingenuity,

17:38.187 --> 17:39.580
a touch of Captain Lance's
bravery,

17:39.623 --> 17:42.104
and what would
any good Legends' plan be

17:42.148 --> 17:43.845

letting that happen.

19:20.333 --> 19:21.812
You sure this can
kill the virus?

19:21.856 --> 19:24.206
- Yeah, but now that it knows
that we're hunting it,

19:24.250 --> 19:25.773
it's going to do its utmost
to stay hidden

19:25.816 --> 19:27.514

may lose a memory

19:35.652 --> 19:37.785
that she can never get back.

19:37.828 --> 19:40.440
- Uh, Gideon, kill the virus,
reboot Gideon,

19:40.483 --> 19:42.442
get back on the road,
save the Legends.

19:42.485 --> 19:44.270
- What could be more simple?

19:44.313 --> 19:45.706

my partner in crime

20:31.969 --> 20:34.276
was using your decorative urn
as a bedpan

You were chosen because
you are each uniquely suited

20:55.254 --> 20:57.299
- The announcement, Captain.

20:58.953 --> 21:01.390
- There is only one lavatory
on the ship.

- One bathroom?

21:04.480 --> 21:05.960
- Whoa!
- It's the virus!

21:06.003 --> 21:07.788

being Hawkman.

around, man.

21:11.705 --> 21:13.315
Hey, you said we're Legends.

21:13.359 --> 21:15.709
But right now, it just feels
like we're your prisoners, man.

21:15.752 --> 21:18.320
- It's a flying
Stanford Prison Experiment.

21:18.364 --> 21:19.930
- I apologize, but the ship

21:19.974 --> 21:21.889
was only built

- Gideon.

Gideon, who you are

33:54.119 --> 33:55.772

- No.

be worth it?

- Coming.

Me and Gideon are almost done
fabricating the stuffing,

Excellent coordinating, B.

34:20.275 --> 34:22.147

34:22.190 --> 34:24.410
I allow myself one fun-size
candy bar a year for Halloween.

Thank you.
