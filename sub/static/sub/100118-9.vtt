00:01.653 --> 00:03.960
Previously onDynasty...The district attorney

00:04.004 --> 00:05.048
has a secret witness.

00:05.092 --> 00:07.790
It's Alexis Carrington Colby.

00:07.833 --> 00:10.140
FALLON:
I paid Nadia to make you
fall in love with her,

00:10.184 --> 00:12.490
and then I staged a fake fight, with Cristal's help,

00:12.534 --> 00:13.448
to make it look like Blake

00:13.491 --> 00:14.449
had sex with Nadia.

00:14.492 --> 00:15.667
So that's not true.

00:15.711 --> 00:17.539
I just burned down
Father's vineyard.

00:17.582 --> 00:19.062
LIAM:
It was you that hit me
over the head.

00:20.324 --> 00:21.543
I nearly died!No!

00:24.067 --> 00:25.155
FALLON:
Oh, no!

00:25.199 --> 00:26.156
Liam! Liam!

00:26.200 --> 00:28.289
Come on!

00:28.332 --> 00:30.160
Pull me up!

00:32.945 --> 00:34.251
Aah!

00:39.126 --> 00:40.257
JUDGE:
Order!

00:40.301 --> 00:42.216
Order in the court!

00:42.259 --> 00:44.087
Your Honor, the defense
requests a recess

00:44.131 --> 00:47.221
so we have time to prepare
for this surprise witness.

00:47.264 --> 00:50.267
Granted. Court will resume
in one hour.

00:50.311 --> 00:51.138
May I approach?

00:56.578 --> 00:58.841
Wow. What the hell
are you doing here?

00:58.884 --> 01:01.322
Just doing my part to make sure
justice prevails.

01:01.365 --> 01:02.845
Mm, right.

01:02.888 --> 01:04.107
And you're a Colby now.

01:04.151 --> 01:05.369
Well, I hope Jeff
didn't have to pay

01:05.413 --> 01:07.023
too much for
your allegiance.

01:08.068 --> 01:09.199
You change your
loyalty as often

01:09.243 --> 01:10.374
as you change your face.

01:10.418 --> 01:12.115
You and I both know
you have nothing

01:12.159 --> 01:14.117
relevant you can
say against me.

01:14.161 --> 01:17.729
You have no idea what I know
and what I don't know.

01:17.773 --> 01:20.080
Which must be
terrifying for you.

01:26.869 --> 01:30.394
We should postpone her testimony
till later in the week,

01:30.438 --> 01:32.222
so we have time to prepare.

01:32.266 --> 01:34.268
Ah, there's nothing
that woman has to offer

01:34.311 --> 01:36.183
that would convince
anyone I was guilty.

01:36.226 --> 01:38.141
You don't know that.
It's...Trust me.

01:38.185 --> 01:40.187
The more time we give her,
the bigger story she'll spin.

01:40.230 --> 01:42.189
Put her on the stand.
Let's get this over with.

01:46.845 --> 01:48.064
Hey, hey, hey.

01:48.108 --> 01:50.371
Are you sure
you're not hurt?

01:50.414 --> 01:52.112
Do I know you?

01:55.506 --> 01:58.161
Now's not the time
for amnesia jokes, all right?

01:58.205 --> 01:59.815
Good to know.

01:59.858 --> 02:02.600
Okay, look, are you sure that
nothing got jostled up there?

02:02.644 --> 02:04.298
Like, you're not gonna
wake up tomorrow and think

02:04.341 --> 02:06.343
that you're in love with your
fourth grade girlfriend, right?

02:06.387 --> 02:07.866
Audrey Simmons.

02:07.910 --> 02:09.303
She was pretty cute.

02:09.346 --> 02:10.956
Probably super hot now.

02:11.000 --> 02:13.785
You're sure that you remember
Adam hitting you by the pool?

02:13.829 --> 02:15.787
Yeah, he came up
from behind me,

02:15.831 --> 02:17.267
and I got a glimpse
of the flowerpot.

02:17.311 --> 02:18.703
Next thing I remember,

02:18.747 --> 02:20.662
I woke up in the shed
with my head pounding.

02:20.705 --> 02:21.967
I knew it.

02:22.011 --> 02:24.013
I knew he was responsible.

02:25.014 --> 02:26.146
Hi.

02:26.189 --> 02:28.148
Are his ribs broken?

02:28.191 --> 02:29.497
Aw.

02:31.238 --> 02:33.631
You are lucky
that I don't do worse.

02:33.675 --> 02:36.939
But Blake will, once
he finds out that you set fire

02:36.982 --> 02:38.245
to his precious
vineyard.

02:38.288 --> 02:39.333
How delusional you are.

02:39.376 --> 02:40.986
Father is going to forgive me

02:41.030 --> 02:43.032
when he finds out
that you bribed Nadia

02:43.075 --> 02:44.294
to fall in
love with me

02:44.338 --> 02:45.469
and then pretend
to sleep with Blake.

02:45.513 --> 02:46.557
And then he's gonna blame you.

02:46.601 --> 02:47.993
Yeah. Good luck with that.

02:48.037 --> 02:49.343
In the meantime, we'll be sure

02:49.386 --> 02:51.258
to send the police over
to arrest you

02:51.301 --> 02:53.260
for attempted murder
with a deadly weapon.

02:53.303 --> 02:55.175
It was a
flowerpot, Fallon.

02:55.218 --> 02:56.872
Well, yeah, but a deadly one.

02:56.915 --> 02:58.569
Feel free to go light
on the pain meds.

02:58.613 --> 02:59.831
LIAM:
Maybe we should

02:59.875 --> 03:02.225
hold off on the
cops for now.

03:02.269 --> 03:04.923
Maybe deal with one
murder charge at a time.

03:04.967 --> 03:06.795
Fine.

03:06.838 --> 03:09.928
But unless the prosecution
has the murder on tape,

03:09.972 --> 03:12.104
Blake will be home
in a few days.

03:12.148 --> 03:14.498
And then we can go
after Adam.

03:16.544 --> 03:18.807
Someone needs to explain
to me what's going on

03:18.850 --> 03:20.069
before I have an aneurysm.

03:20.112 --> 03:21.331
What's to explain?

03:21.375 --> 03:22.463
This marriage
is a sham.

03:22.506 --> 03:23.899
It's just a
matter of why.

03:23.942 --> 03:25.074
JENNINGS:
If Alexis is involved,

03:25.117 --> 03:26.858
I'm guessing
it has to do with money.

03:26.902 --> 03:29.644
That is the gold digger
calling the kettle black.

03:29.687 --> 03:31.646
Obviously, you don't love her.

03:31.689 --> 03:32.951
And why is that obvious?

03:32.995 --> 03:34.866
Jeff, a word?

03:34.910 --> 03:36.259
Without the wife.

03:37.652 --> 03:40.002
I should freshen up anyway.

03:40.045 --> 03:41.960
JENNINGS:
Should we be worried
about her testimony?

03:42.004 --> 03:43.179
Alexis knows nothing.

03:43.223 --> 03:44.441
The D.A.'s wasting
everyone's time.

03:44.485 --> 03:46.922
If anything, this
makes me more confident.

03:46.965 --> 03:48.619
Son, I know we're not on
great terms right now,

03:48.663 --> 03:51.274
but Alexis is bad news.

03:51.318 --> 03:52.928
If you're in trouble,
let me help you out of it.

03:52.971 --> 03:54.277
Does she have blackmail on you?

03:54.321 --> 03:56.018
Is that what's happening?You're right.

03:56.061 --> 03:57.715
We aren't on great terms,
or even good ones,

03:57.759 --> 03:59.761
which is why
your opinion doesn't matter.

03:59.804 --> 04:00.892
She's using you.

04:00.936 --> 04:02.720
Oh, the only person
using me is you.

04:02.764 --> 04:04.374
And I can take care
of myself.

04:04.418 --> 04:06.507
FALLON:
Hey. Is the trial over?

04:06.550 --> 04:09.292
Did I miss the verdict?
You're guilty, right?

04:09.336 --> 04:10.946
No, you didn't miss the verdict,

04:10.989 --> 04:12.904
but thank you
for the vote of confidence.

04:12.948 --> 04:14.819
You did miss the return
of your mother.

04:14.863 --> 04:16.038
What? She's back?

04:16.081 --> 04:17.257
With a new face.

04:17.300 --> 04:18.301
And a stepfather for you.

04:18.345 --> 04:20.303
But I think
you've met him already.

04:20.347 --> 04:22.697
You know Jeff, right?
Your former fiancÃ©?

04:28.137 --> 04:31.009
Ah, Blake just
filled me in.

04:31.053 --> 04:33.273
He's kidding, right?

04:33.316 --> 04:35.144
It's true.

04:35.187 --> 04:36.580
Does she have some kind
of blackmail on you?

04:36.624 --> 04:37.886
I mean, is someone
watching right now

04:37.929 --> 04:39.322
that can have you killed?
Blink twice for yes.

04:39.366 --> 04:41.411
Fallon? Can you explain

04:41.455 --> 04:43.413
why my vineyard is burned
to the ground?

04:43.457 --> 04:46.024
I can, but maybe
you should talk to Adam,

04:46.068 --> 04:47.417
who made sure to torch every

04:47.461 --> 04:49.767
last vine the second
his sight came back.

04:49.811 --> 04:51.595
BAILIFF:
Court is now back in session.

04:51.639 --> 04:53.249
We're not done here.

04:53.293 --> 04:55.556
And neither are we.

04:56.600 --> 04:58.646
D.A. BROWN:
Mrs. Colby,

04:58.689 --> 05:01.257
where were you
on the night of March 15?

05:01.301 --> 05:03.651
I was home in my loft
on the Carrington property.

05:03.694 --> 05:06.349
I had my hair done at 6:00,
I was home by 8:00,

05:06.393 --> 05:08.786
and enjoying
my nightly ritual by 9:00.

05:08.830 --> 05:10.135
Ritual?

05:10.179 --> 05:12.355
At the end of each day,
I reward myself

05:12.399 --> 05:15.663
with a bubble bath and cocktail.

05:15.706 --> 05:17.882
Can't forget
to pamper ourselves.

05:17.926 --> 05:19.667
Hmm.
Did anything

05:19.710 --> 05:21.364
strange happen
this particular night?

05:21.408 --> 05:23.279
Other then seeing a man
being murdered, you mean?

05:23.323 --> 05:24.541
No, I mean exactly that.

05:24.585 --> 05:26.456
Can you describe for us
what you saw?

05:26.500 --> 05:28.328
When I looked through
the bathroom window--

05:28.371 --> 05:30.547
which has a direct line
of sight to the lake--

05:30.591 --> 05:33.768
I saw Blake strangling Mack
with his bare hands.

05:34.943 --> 05:36.379
Which is
understandable since

05:36.423 --> 05:38.468
Mack turned on Blake after

05:38.512 --> 05:40.383
Blake ordered him to kill
Cristal's lover Mark Jennings.

05:40.427 --> 05:42.298
Not that

05:42.342 --> 05:44.300
I'm condoning murder, of course.

05:44.344 --> 05:45.736
I will never
forget the look

05:45.780 --> 05:47.172
of violence in his eyes.

05:47.216 --> 05:48.217
Objection!

05:48.260 --> 05:49.392
Which is probably
what Mack said,

05:49.436 --> 05:50.567
if he could have spoken.

05:50.611 --> 05:52.700
Sustained. Please

05:52.743 --> 05:54.266
just stick
to the facts.

05:54.310 --> 05:56.704
The fact of the matter is,

05:56.747 --> 06:00.403
I saw Blake Carrington kill

06:00.447 --> 06:03.450
Nathan MacIntosh.

06:05.495 --> 06:08.237
Your Honor,
no further questions.

06:12.633 --> 06:13.895
I was watching
the jury, Blake.

06:13.938 --> 06:15.418
They were hanging
on every word.

06:15.462 --> 06:17.681
Yeah. I know. It's time
to move forward with our plan.

06:17.725 --> 06:20.162
If we get caught,
things could get much worse.

06:20.205 --> 06:22.164
Worse than a
life sentence?

06:22.207 --> 06:23.600
We need to get
Anders going

06:23.644 --> 06:25.602
before we lose our
window of opportunity.

06:25.646 --> 06:27.909
FALLON:
Hello,

06:27.952 --> 06:31.434
Mother, or at least I assume
it's you under there somewhere.

06:31.478 --> 06:32.827
It's lovely to see you, darling.

06:32.870 --> 06:34.481
I'm doing well, thank you.

06:35.395 --> 06:36.439
I'm a newlywed.

06:36.483 --> 06:37.701
Yes, yes, I heard.

06:37.745 --> 06:39.355
I'm not sure
which makes less sense--

06:39.399 --> 06:40.748
you being married to Jeff,

06:40.791 --> 06:43.403
or that fairy tale
you were spinning on the stand.

06:43.446 --> 06:45.405
You're the one living
in a fairy tale, Fallon.

06:45.448 --> 06:47.494
You're so obsessed with thinking
I'm the evil witch,

06:47.537 --> 06:49.844
you can't see the Big Bad Wolf
right in front of you.

06:49.887 --> 06:51.715
I'm not sure
that's quite how that one goes,

06:51.759 --> 06:53.587
though I'm not surprised,
considering

06:53.630 --> 06:56.503
you made the staff read me
bedtime stories as a kid.

06:56.546 --> 06:59.506
Yes, yes, I'm a terrible mother,
everything is my fault.

06:59.549 --> 07:02.596
Doesn't change the fact
that every word I said is true.

07:03.814 --> 07:06.600
We inherit different things
from our parents.

07:06.643 --> 07:10.038
You got your natural flair
and stunning eyebrows from me.

07:10.081 --> 07:11.735
I just hope
you didn't

07:11.779 --> 07:14.216
inherit
your father's ruthlessness.

07:14.259 --> 07:15.522
He's a murderer.

07:15.565 --> 07:18.481
And he's finally gonna
get what he deserves.

07:18.525 --> 07:20.352
Which'll leave more time
for us to reconnect,

07:20.396 --> 07:22.050
so, good news, bad news.

07:23.660 --> 07:25.706
Mmm.

07:52.341 --> 07:54.386
Okay, I need
to ask you something,

07:54.430 --> 07:56.432
and I really, really don't
want to, but it's like

07:56.476 --> 07:58.652
Sophie's choice trying to decide
which parent is crazier.

07:58.695 --> 08:00.871
So before you take another sip,

08:00.915 --> 08:02.394
I need you
to answer me honestly.

08:02.438 --> 08:04.309
Is Alexis telling the truth?

08:04.353 --> 08:05.528
How could you even ask that?

08:05.572 --> 08:07.182
This is your mother
we're talking about.

08:07.225 --> 08:08.618
Lying is like
an art form to her,

08:08.662 --> 08:10.185
and this is her Sistine Chapel.

08:10.228 --> 08:11.273
Mm.

08:11.316 --> 08:12.666
I can promise you,

08:12.709 --> 08:15.320
she did not see
what she claimed to see.

08:15.364 --> 08:16.757
She probably
wasn't even here.

08:16.800 --> 08:18.454
Well, then
why would she say that?

08:18.498 --> 08:20.543
Because her vendetta
against me is so insane

08:20.587 --> 08:22.763
that she's willing
to perjure herself.

08:22.806 --> 08:24.199
I did not kill Mack.

08:24.242 --> 08:25.679
And I don't deserve
to go to prison

08:25.722 --> 08:28.420
for the rest of my life
because your mother is unstable.

08:28.464 --> 08:32.337
I just need to figure out a
way to prove that she's lying.

08:32.381 --> 08:35.471
Well, maybe I could help.

08:36.298 --> 08:38.169
What? We may have our issues,

08:38.213 --> 08:41.346
but I don't want
to see you in jail... or dead.

08:41.390 --> 08:42.478
I'm touched.

08:42.522 --> 08:44.785
But what could you possibly do
to help?

08:44.828 --> 08:46.526
Well, you say
she wasn't here, right?

08:46.569 --> 08:48.484
So we just need to prove
that she's lying.

08:48.528 --> 08:50.225
If you recall,
Alexis writes down everything

08:50.268 --> 08:52.488
that happens to her
in one of her planners.

08:52.532 --> 08:53.881
She thinks it'll be useful

08:53.924 --> 08:55.535
when she hires someone
to ghostwrite her memoirs.

08:55.578 --> 08:57.580
Does she actually think anyone's
clamoring for her life story?

08:57.624 --> 08:59.800
My life story is a hundred times
more interesting than hers...

08:59.843 --> 09:01.845
It's not the point, Dad.

09:03.281 --> 09:05.240
Right. Well,

09:05.283 --> 09:07.285
you do what you think you can.

09:08.504 --> 09:11.551
Thank you...
for believing in my innocence.

09:11.594 --> 09:13.248
Hmm.

09:17.731 --> 09:19.646
What happens
if she finds out the truth?

09:19.689 --> 09:21.648
She's not going to because
I'm not going to tell her,

09:21.691 --> 09:23.127
and neither are you.

09:24.172 --> 09:26.522
But since we don't know

09:26.566 --> 09:28.829
how successful she's going
to be, how's our plan going?

09:28.872 --> 09:31.527
I spoke to the jury consultant.

09:31.571 --> 09:33.442
And based on that conversation,

09:33.485 --> 09:36.576
this is the juror
that we're targeting.

09:37.925 --> 09:39.535
Now,

09:39.579 --> 09:41.972
do you want me to summon Adam
to discuss the vineyard fire?

09:42.016 --> 09:43.278
One problem
at a time.

09:43.321 --> 09:44.671
You know,
I thought kids were supposed

09:44.714 --> 09:47.499
to get easier
when they turned 18.

09:49.414 --> 09:52.069
Have you heard
from Kirby since she left?

09:52.113 --> 09:54.158
You mean, since you sent her
out of the state

09:54.202 --> 09:55.943
because you didn't want her
to testify against you

09:55.986 --> 09:58.380
even though she had no plans to?
No, I haven't. No.

09:58.423 --> 09:59.860
But as you say,

09:59.903 --> 10:01.905
one problem at a time.

10:01.949 --> 10:03.907
Right.

10:03.951 --> 10:06.170
ALEXIS:
Be careful

10:06.214 --> 10:07.824
with those turbans.

10:07.868 --> 10:10.174
The mannequin heads alone cost
more than your yearly salary.

10:10.218 --> 10:12.176
Oh.

10:12.220 --> 10:15.397
I see you're back
after abandoning me once again.

10:15.440 --> 10:18.008
I didn't abandon you.
You're a grown man.

10:18.052 --> 10:20.271
And now you're moving out?Yes.

10:20.315 --> 10:21.533
Now that I'm remarried,
I thought

10:21.577 --> 10:23.448
my husband and I should live
in the same place.

10:23.492 --> 10:25.494
So it's true?
You married Jeff?We're registered

10:25.537 --> 10:26.713
at Aston Martin.

10:26.756 --> 10:28.976
I'm doing what needs
to be done.

10:29.019 --> 10:31.674
Oh, to put it in terms
you'll understand,

10:31.718 --> 10:33.633
it's as if I'm shoving
Blake's face

10:33.676 --> 10:36.418
into the fire
to teach him a lesson.

10:36.461 --> 10:38.681
Metaphorically speaking.

10:38.725 --> 10:39.682
Subtle, Mother.

10:39.726 --> 10:41.423
I'm willing
to call a truce.

10:41.466 --> 10:43.555
And the only way that we're
gonna have a relationship

10:43.599 --> 10:46.428
is if we put the past
behind us and start fresh.

10:48.560 --> 10:50.562
That's never gonna happen.

10:50.606 --> 10:52.129
You're a Colby now.

10:52.173 --> 10:53.217
I'm a Carrington.

10:53.261 --> 10:55.002
You've made your choice.

10:57.004 --> 10:58.266
REPORTER :
And today in court,

10:58.309 --> 10:59.702
in a stunning
and rather fashionable twist...

10:59.746 --> 11:01.182
Anything new?

11:01.225 --> 11:05.012
Just the same old faces
with nothing to say.

11:05.055 --> 11:07.667
There's one face I haven't
seen around here in a while.

11:07.710 --> 11:08.842
I assume you mean Vanessa?

11:08.885 --> 11:10.060
Have you heard from her?

11:10.104 --> 11:11.888
Not since she checked
out of the hotel.

11:11.932 --> 11:13.629
And her job.

11:13.673 --> 11:15.370
Apparently, she's in
New York with Monica.

11:15.413 --> 11:16.763
Damn.

11:16.806 --> 11:18.590
Thought we had a good thing
going there for a while.

11:18.634 --> 11:20.549
Guess I was wrong.

11:20.592 --> 11:23.421
Oh, brother, you're
preaching to the choir.

11:23.465 --> 11:25.989
I haven't heard a thing from
Fletcher since our kiss.

11:26.033 --> 11:28.339
And I thought we
had a connection.

11:28.383 --> 11:30.080
Did you call him?
No.

11:30.124 --> 11:31.560
Did you call Vanessa?

11:31.603 --> 11:32.561
Yes.

11:32.604 --> 11:34.650
I just never heard back.

11:34.694 --> 11:37.697
Well, Fletcher can
call me if he wants.

11:37.740 --> 11:39.263
Seriously?
Mm-hmm.

11:39.307 --> 11:42.136
Why don't you just call him,
ask him out on a date right now?

11:42.179 --> 11:43.659
Worst case, he says no.

11:43.703 --> 11:45.182
Then, at least you know,
right?

11:45.226 --> 11:48.577
Okay, fine.

11:51.275 --> 11:52.799
Fletcher.

11:52.842 --> 11:56.106
Hi, it's Sam Jones
from La Mirage.

11:56.150 --> 11:57.891
Yeah, of course you know.

11:57.934 --> 11:59.414
Look, I wanted to ask you

11:59.457 --> 12:02.112
if you wanted to grab drinks.

12:03.723 --> 12:05.463
What project are we discussing?

12:05.507 --> 12:06.551
I, uh...

12:06.595 --> 12:07.596
I would rather talk

12:07.639 --> 12:08.684
about the project in person.

12:08.728 --> 12:10.425
Yeah.

12:11.469 --> 12:12.557
Great, great.

12:12.601 --> 12:13.907
Okay, see you then.

12:15.604 --> 12:17.606
FALLON:
A peace offering.

12:17.649 --> 12:21.436
I'm sorry I was
a little crabby earlier.

12:21.479 --> 12:23.481
You know, it's not every
day that your mother

12:23.525 --> 12:25.875
marries your cousin,
except maybe in Nebraska.

12:25.919 --> 12:27.442
This is very big
of you, Fallon.

12:27.485 --> 12:28.530
Thanks for being
so mature.

12:28.573 --> 12:29.574
Well, you know,

12:29.618 --> 12:31.446
that's me-- mature.

12:31.489 --> 12:32.752
So, tell me,

12:32.795 --> 12:34.841
how did this whole thing
come about?

12:34.884 --> 12:36.756
And please feel free
to leave out anything

12:36.799 --> 12:38.061
that might make me
sick to my stomach.

12:38.105 --> 12:39.149
Well,

12:39.193 --> 12:40.977
when I was in the Alps,
I heard Alexis

12:41.021 --> 12:42.762
had been in the hospital
in Switzerland.

12:42.805 --> 12:46.678
So I popped over a couple
of times to visit.

12:46.722 --> 12:48.985
You know what they say--
timing is everything.

12:49.029 --> 12:51.031
Wow, and
just think,

12:51.074 --> 12:53.163
if Jeff and I had
actually gotten married,

12:53.207 --> 12:56.601
he would've been your nephew
and your son-in-law,

12:56.645 --> 12:58.952
you know, instead of your
nephew and your husband.

12:58.995 --> 13:00.301
I just think
that's amazing.

13:00.344 --> 13:02.129
Cheers, to love.

13:02.172 --> 13:04.174
To love.
To love.

13:08.657 --> 13:10.746
Oh, wow, there they go.

13:10.790 --> 13:12.400
Okay, all right.

13:12.443 --> 13:14.532
All right, I told
you not to do that.

13:14.576 --> 13:16.534
Okay, I'm gonna go
to the bathroom and throw up.

13:16.578 --> 13:18.536
I'll be right back.

13:35.553 --> 13:36.903
Okay.

13:36.946 --> 13:38.948
Your birthday?

13:41.777 --> 13:43.692
The day you claim
is your birthday?

13:54.703 --> 13:55.922
Ah...

13:55.965 --> 13:57.837
Blake's birthday.

13:57.880 --> 14:01.057
Here's to psychotic,
unrequited love.

14:09.152 --> 14:10.850
There you are.

14:19.946 --> 14:21.643
ALEXIS:
Fallon?

14:21.686 --> 14:23.645
How are you
feeling?

14:23.688 --> 14:25.821
It was just
a tiny kiss.

14:25.865 --> 14:27.301
It's not like
we were...

14:27.344 --> 14:28.693
Can I help you
with anything?

14:28.737 --> 14:29.738
Oh!

14:29.781 --> 14:31.305
Well, I was walking

14:31.348 --> 14:32.959
to the bathroom

14:33.002 --> 14:35.048
when this photo of us
caught my eye.

14:35.091 --> 14:37.877
Ah, yes.

14:37.920 --> 14:39.530
Two faces ago.

14:39.574 --> 14:41.228
So tell me,

14:41.271 --> 14:42.882
how are you dealing
with Blake's circus?

14:42.925 --> 14:43.665
Because don't worry,

14:43.708 --> 14:45.232
Mommy is here now.

14:45.275 --> 14:47.756
Oh, I'm doing so much better.

14:47.799 --> 14:49.889
I hope you can
be happy for me.

14:49.932 --> 14:51.325
The heart wants
what the heart wants.

14:51.368 --> 14:53.718
Of course, and when
the heart wants a billionaire,

14:53.762 --> 14:55.285
there's just no stopping it.

14:55.329 --> 14:58.462
You and I were in such a good
place before I went abroad.

14:58.506 --> 15:00.551
We finally had trust.

15:00.595 --> 15:03.903
I hope we can pick right
back up where we left off.

15:03.946 --> 15:04.904
Oh, we can.

15:04.947 --> 15:06.557
And we will.

15:06.601 --> 15:09.256
But first, let's get back
to those celebratory drinks.

15:09.299 --> 15:12.737
We don't want your new husband
getting too drunk, now, do we?

15:27.970 --> 15:29.232
Is now a good time
to talk?

15:29.276 --> 15:30.973
Yeah, I would tell you
to use your judgment,

15:31.017 --> 15:33.106
but clearly you lost that
when you regained your sight.

15:33.149 --> 15:34.324
I can explain
about the vineyard.

15:34.368 --> 15:35.456
What is there
to explain?

15:35.499 --> 15:37.458
You light a match,
it starts a fire.

15:37.501 --> 15:38.938
You caused my vineyard
to go up in flames

15:38.981 --> 15:40.330
like the spires of Notre-Dame.

15:40.374 --> 15:42.332
I think that's
an unfair comparison.

15:42.376 --> 15:44.334
Yeah, you're right.
Notre-Dame is still standing.

15:44.378 --> 15:46.946
This is all Fallon's fault.

15:46.989 --> 15:49.426
Fallon paid Nadia
to fall in love with me,

15:49.470 --> 15:52.125
and then set it up so that
I would hear Nadia talking

15:52.168 --> 15:54.562
to Cristal about how she was
having an affair with you,

15:54.605 --> 15:56.259
and that she was
only sleeping with me

15:56.303 --> 15:57.869
to make you jealous,
which obviously was

15:57.913 --> 16:00.307
devastating for me,
so, yeah, I lost my mind

16:00.350 --> 16:02.439
a little and set the fire
to get back at you,

16:02.483 --> 16:04.180
but then Fallon confessed

16:04.224 --> 16:07.227
to orchestrating
the whole thing.

16:07.270 --> 16:09.446
That's the most ridiculous story
I've ever heard.

16:11.492 --> 16:12.928
And why would you sleep
with the woman that

16:12.972 --> 16:14.930
we hired to help you
during a medical crisis?

16:14.974 --> 16:16.932
Um, well, I didn't think about
Nadia in that way. I was...I don't care!

16:16.976 --> 16:18.499
While you were busy
destroying the one thing

16:18.542 --> 16:20.849
left in my life
that I still care about,

16:20.892 --> 16:23.243
I'm on trial for murder!Father, please...

16:23.286 --> 16:24.548
Get out.

16:24.592 --> 16:26.550
I can make this up to you.

16:26.594 --> 16:28.509
Now.

16:33.514 --> 16:35.559
Hi, can I speak
to Tripp Worthington?

16:40.825 --> 16:44.090
I see I've wasted a perfectly
good outfit for no reason.

16:44.133 --> 16:46.483
There is no

16:46.527 --> 16:48.572
Peachtree Preservation
Society meeting, is there?

16:48.616 --> 16:52.533
Well, I knew you wouldn't
accept an invitation from me,

16:52.576 --> 16:54.056
so I had to improvise.

16:54.100 --> 16:55.275
Sit.

16:55.318 --> 16:56.972
Let's not cause a scene.

16:57.016 --> 16:59.931
Lucky for you, I'm in
a newlywed kind of mood.

16:59.975 --> 17:01.542
And what better way to celebrate

17:01.585 --> 17:06.286
than with my half-sister-in-
law-turned-mother-in-law?

17:06.329 --> 17:07.896
We'll see how long that lasts.

17:07.939 --> 17:10.029
Not long if I can help it.

17:10.072 --> 17:11.682
Well, you can't.

17:11.726 --> 17:13.162
And your son, oh,

17:13.206 --> 17:15.251
well, he certainly knows
how to treat a lady.

17:15.295 --> 17:16.644
Surprising, given that

17:16.687 --> 17:18.385
his mother wasn't
around to raise him.

17:18.428 --> 17:21.475
I'm not sure you're the best one
to talk about mothering skills.

17:21.518 --> 17:24.565
Actually, Jeff is
grateful that you left.

17:24.608 --> 17:25.827
Some people
can cause more damage

17:25.870 --> 17:27.568
if they stick around too long.

17:27.611 --> 17:30.223
So kudos to you for realizing
your shortcomings.

17:33.008 --> 17:34.183
A toast.

17:34.227 --> 17:35.793
To Jeff.

17:35.837 --> 17:38.057
I don't know what you're trying
to sell with this marriage,

17:38.100 --> 17:40.276
but I'm not
buying it.

17:40.320 --> 17:42.496
Jeff is going to throw you away
like rotten fruit

17:42.539 --> 17:44.454
when he sees
the parasite you are.

17:44.498 --> 17:46.413
So just know...

17:46.456 --> 17:48.850
the only way you'll get
one cent of Jeff's money

17:48.893 --> 17:50.808
is over my dead body.

17:50.852 --> 17:52.245
I'm gonna give you some advice.

17:52.288 --> 17:55.117
And I'm gonna use small words
so you understand.

17:55.161 --> 17:57.380
If you don't get on board
with this marriage,

17:57.424 --> 18:00.079
you're gonna end
up drowning alone.

18:04.518 --> 18:06.737
It's burnt.

18:06.781 --> 18:08.957
This champagne was
obviously frozen

18:09.000 --> 18:11.133
in the bottle at some point.

18:11.177 --> 18:12.352
I know.

18:12.395 --> 18:14.397
That's why you're
drinking that one.

18:24.581 --> 18:25.974
Hello. Parlor de Sol.
How may I help you?

18:26.017 --> 18:27.584
Hi, this is Fallon Carrington.

18:27.628 --> 18:29.499
Um, I need you to do me
a little favor,

18:29.543 --> 18:31.458
and just tell me
if my mother Alexis

18:31.501 --> 18:33.199
had an appointment on March 15?

18:33.242 --> 18:34.548
I'm sorry, I just can't do that.

18:34.591 --> 18:35.940
Well, of course you can.

18:35.984 --> 18:37.681
Just stare at the computer
sitting in front of you,

18:37.725 --> 18:40.293
press a few keys, and glance
at the schedule for that day.

18:40.336 --> 18:42.121
I just need to know
what time she was there.

18:42.164 --> 18:43.644
Obviously, I can do it.

18:43.687 --> 18:45.341
I'm just not allowed.

18:45.385 --> 18:47.213
Becky's schedule is
her own private business.

18:47.256 --> 18:50.129
Okay, well, then can I book
your next appointment?

18:50.172 --> 18:51.652
I mean, if I move
a few things around,

18:51.695 --> 18:53.654
I could possibly be
available tomorrow.

18:53.697 --> 18:54.959
Becky could see you
in four months.

18:55.003 --> 18:56.309
Four months?

18:56.352 --> 18:59.007
Well, is there
a cancellation list?

18:59.050 --> 19:01.662
Absolutely, but Ms. Tennybelle
never cancels.

19:01.705 --> 19:03.185
Laura Jean Tennybelle?

19:03.229 --> 19:04.534
The bottled water heiress?

19:04.578 --> 19:05.883
Oh, that's great news.

19:05.927 --> 19:07.189
Okay, that's all. Bye.

19:13.674 --> 19:15.502
Oh.

19:15.545 --> 19:17.199
Don't tell me you
and my mother went shopping.

19:17.243 --> 19:18.244
What are you talking about?

19:18.287 --> 19:19.462
The woman is broke.

19:19.506 --> 19:20.898
Hey.

19:20.942 --> 19:22.204
Yeah.

19:22.248 --> 19:23.771
You're having me surveilled?

19:23.814 --> 19:26.600
Good thing I don't have
a bad side anymore.

19:26.643 --> 19:29.211
The bartender from Club Colby
called me after he took this.

19:29.255 --> 19:30.473
It struck him
as odd you two

19:30.517 --> 19:32.214
were bonding over
bubbly, since he knows

19:32.258 --> 19:33.607
I'm barely speaking
to my mother.

19:33.650 --> 19:34.825
Bonding?

19:34.869 --> 19:36.262
It took all my strength
not to reach over

19:36.305 --> 19:38.568
and rip off her fake eyelashes.

19:38.612 --> 19:39.743
So, how do you explain this?

19:39.787 --> 19:41.702
She lured me there
with a phony invitation

19:41.745 --> 19:43.138
to a society function.

19:43.182 --> 19:45.140
Believe me,

19:45.184 --> 19:46.402
I am not gonna
do anything

19:46.446 --> 19:47.925
to jeopardize
what we're building.

19:47.969 --> 19:51.538
I have to be able
to trust you, Alexis.

19:51.581 --> 19:53.975
This whole arrangement
is based on trust.

19:54.018 --> 19:55.411
You can trust me.

19:55.455 --> 19:58.109
We're gonna put
Blake away for a long time

19:58.153 --> 20:00.547
and then get
what we both deserve.

20:18.782 --> 20:20.262
Libby Winters?

20:20.306 --> 20:21.350
Who's asking?

20:21.394 --> 20:23.744
This restroom
is only for jurors.

20:23.787 --> 20:25.789
I'm someone who can and will
put your life in danger

20:25.833 --> 20:28.575
if you don't vote for
Blake Carrington's acquittal.

20:28.618 --> 20:29.619
What?!

20:29.663 --> 20:31.534
Who are you?!

20:31.578 --> 20:34.058
JENNINGS:
Don't come out until I'm gone.

20:39.803 --> 20:41.414
I was in the restroom and
somebody was threatening me.

20:41.457 --> 20:43.285
I don't know who it was.

20:43.329 --> 20:45.461
But they were
wearing red heels.

20:47.115 --> 20:49.073
That's her,
it's Mrs. Carrington.

20:51.598 --> 20:55.166
Mr. Carrington, Juror Number
Five claims that during recess

20:55.210 --> 20:57.125
she was threatened by Mrs.
Carrington-- is this true?

20:57.168 --> 20:58.561
Your Honor?

20:58.605 --> 21:00.128
Well, no, of course not.

21:00.171 --> 21:02.435
Your Honor,
I would never do anything

21:02.478 --> 21:04.350
to put my husband's
trial at risk.

21:04.393 --> 21:05.829
I would hope not.

21:05.873 --> 21:07.831
I've never seen this woman
outside of the courtroom.

21:07.875 --> 21:09.746
May I see your shoes,
please, Mrs. Carrington?

21:09.790 --> 21:12.662
My shoes? Okay.

21:20.366 --> 21:22.150
She changed shoes.

21:22.193 --> 21:24.587
I don't know what to tell you.
These are my shoes.

21:24.631 --> 21:26.067
Judge, you saw them.

21:26.110 --> 21:28.069
I actually have been busy
with other matters.

21:28.112 --> 21:30.985
Though this trial
has been like Fashion Week.

21:31.028 --> 21:34.118
You may be seated,
Mrs. Carrington.

21:34.162 --> 21:35.903
You're trying to make
me think I'm crazy,

21:35.946 --> 21:37.948
but you're both insane.

21:37.992 --> 21:41.865
JUDGE:
Nevertheless, I have no choice
but to dismiss you, Ms. Winters.

21:41.909 --> 21:43.867
The court cannot
tolerate distractions.

21:43.911 --> 21:45.739
Thank you for your service.

21:45.782 --> 21:49.003
Alternate juror number one
is now a part of the jury.

21:49.046 --> 21:50.961
You Honor, may I approach?

22:09.240 --> 22:11.982
You the owner of this vineyard?

22:12.026 --> 22:14.768
Tripp Worthington?

22:14.811 --> 22:16.726
I'm Elwood.
Spoke on the phone?

22:16.770 --> 22:19.512
Right, the guy from
the Department of Agriculture.

22:19.555 --> 22:20.948
That's right.

22:20.991 --> 22:22.776
So, the state requires

22:22.819 --> 22:24.734
that we inspect the land
after a flood or fire.

22:24.778 --> 22:26.257
Like the one
on your neighbor's vineyard.

22:26.301 --> 22:27.781
Yeah, that fire was a shame.

22:27.824 --> 22:29.260
Blake Carrington
loved Blue Belt.

22:29.304 --> 22:30.697
Yeah, so I heard.

22:30.740 --> 22:32.960
However, as a result
of that fire,

22:33.003 --> 22:35.876
the county has deemed
your land contaminated.

22:35.919 --> 22:38.357
Contaminated? With what?

22:38.400 --> 22:40.402
Uh, carcinogens. Ash, chemicals.

22:40.446 --> 22:42.839
Uh, but the county is offering
to buy your land

22:42.883 --> 22:45.364
for a very generous price.

22:45.407 --> 22:47.757
And, um, it's gonna be
a lot better than the pile

22:47.801 --> 22:49.890
of dead vines you're gonna
end up with over there.

22:51.326 --> 22:53.459
But this has been
my family's land for years.

22:53.502 --> 22:54.764
I mean, look, I can show you

22:54.808 --> 22:57.463
the contamination levels
in micrograms.

22:57.506 --> 22:58.942
Micrograms?

23:00.291 --> 23:03.599
I don't know what those are,
but they sound bad, Elwood.

23:03.643 --> 23:05.340
Mm-hmm.

23:05.384 --> 23:06.689
I'll have to talk
to my lawyer.

23:06.733 --> 23:08.212
It seems like a good deal.

23:08.256 --> 23:11.390
You have a good day.

23:13.696 --> 23:16.612
Laura Jean, thank you so much
for coming in.

23:16.656 --> 23:18.092
Can I get you anything?

23:18.135 --> 23:20.616
Oh, just some water
for Templeton.Oh, sure. Yeah.

23:20.660 --> 23:23.750
Allison, a bowl
of water, please!

23:23.793 --> 23:27.623
So, I bet you are wondering
why you-- and you-- are here.

23:27.667 --> 23:29.277
Well, I am thrilled

23:29.320 --> 23:32.628
to announce that Templeton has
been selected to grace the cover

23:32.672 --> 23:35.022
of Dog Fancy,
a magazine that I own,

23:35.065 --> 23:37.807
under the Fallon Unlimited
umbrella, of course.

23:37.851 --> 23:39.548
Well, that is
exciting, though

23:39.592 --> 23:41.028
I cannot say that I'm surprised.

23:41.071 --> 23:43.030
Templeton was recently
featured on a website

23:43.073 --> 23:44.466
for a local yappy hour.

23:44.510 --> 23:46.686
That site was completely
overwhelmed with traffic.

23:46.729 --> 23:48.078
Wow. I mean,
what an honor it is

23:48.122 --> 23:49.689
to be in the presence
of a true celebrity.

23:49.732 --> 23:51.647
I, I could feel it
when he walked in.

23:51.691 --> 23:53.562
Uh, this is
my photographer Liam.

23:53.606 --> 23:55.956
He would love to grab
a few shots of your baby boy.

23:55.999 --> 23:57.653
Shouldn't take long.
Maybe an hour, max.

23:57.697 --> 24:00.177
It really depends on the,
on the f-stop situation.

24:00.221 --> 24:01.614
LAURA JEAN:
Oh.

24:01.657 --> 24:03.485
Now? That doesn't work for me.

24:03.529 --> 24:06.096
I have an appointment
I couldn't possibly reschedule.

24:06.140 --> 24:08.490
Seems like he wants to,
but it's fine.

24:08.534 --> 24:10.971
I can just call Henry
the German shepherd.Ooh.

24:11.014 --> 24:12.929
You remember
how photogenic he was?Yeah.

24:12.973 --> 24:15.932
Well, I wouldn't want Templeton
to miss out on this opportunity.

24:15.976 --> 24:18.892
And German shepherds
are so pedestrian.

24:18.935 --> 24:22.069
I suppose I could cancel.

24:22.112 --> 24:24.114
Oh. Well, I mean,
it's completely up to you.

24:24.158 --> 24:25.681
I'm sure whatever
you've got going on

24:25.725 --> 24:27.944
is just as important
as Templeton's big cover.

24:27.988 --> 24:29.946
LIAM:
Would Templeton

24:29.990 --> 24:33.297
like to wear a pirate costume?

24:33.341 --> 24:36.300
A yo-ho-ho, he would.

24:36.344 --> 24:38.346
Oh.

24:43.351 --> 24:45.309
Well, let's get you over here

24:45.353 --> 24:48.008
and find your best light.

24:48.051 --> 24:49.575
All right. Well,
I hate to miss all this,

24:49.618 --> 24:52.316
but I'm being pulled away.
You three have fun.

24:52.360 --> 24:54.623
Who's a good boy?
Aw.

24:54.667 --> 24:56.625
FALLON:
So, Becky, my mother

24:56.669 --> 24:59.280
has been raving about you
for, what, years?

24:59.323 --> 25:00.847
So, so many.

25:00.890 --> 25:04.372
Yes. And does she
usually prefer house calls?

25:04.415 --> 25:06.722
Not usually. Uh,
where should I set up?

25:06.766 --> 25:08.594
A house this size
must have a spa room.

25:08.637 --> 25:10.944
A large shower
area is ideal.

25:10.987 --> 25:12.685
Of course. But I was thinking,

25:12.728 --> 25:15.426
before we begin, we can have
a little drink and chat.

25:15.470 --> 25:17.559
You know, I don't trust
just anyone with the goods.

25:17.603 --> 25:19.996
I don't think
that's a good idea.

25:20.040 --> 25:21.258
Like I said, it takes time.

25:21.302 --> 25:23.957
Oh. Well, my hair is
starting at a solid nine.

25:24.000 --> 25:25.524
I mean, how long
could it possibly take

25:25.567 --> 25:26.786
to get it to a ten?

25:26.829 --> 25:28.701
Hair?Mm-hmm.

25:28.744 --> 25:30.964
Honey, anyone can do hair.

25:31.007 --> 25:33.444
I do the best spray
tan in America.

25:35.925 --> 25:37.579
Of course you do.

25:37.623 --> 25:40.974
Yes, my assistant must have
gotten my appointments confused.

25:41.017 --> 25:42.802
Well, I have another
client after you,

25:42.845 --> 25:44.368
which is a long
night for me.

25:44.412 --> 25:45.935
So point me in the
right direction

25:45.979 --> 25:47.589
and take your clothes off.

25:47.633 --> 25:49.722
All right, Becky.
Let's talk spray tans.

25:49.765 --> 25:51.114
Come with me.

25:51.158 --> 25:54.248
I heard about your
little rendezvous with Alexis.

25:54.291 --> 25:56.250
What are you up to?

25:56.293 --> 25:57.773
Did she enjoy herself?

25:57.817 --> 25:59.296
She was hitting
the bubbly hard.

25:59.340 --> 26:01.995
Not sure she can handle
as much at her age.

26:02.038 --> 26:03.518
You lured her there
with some made-up invitation.

26:03.562 --> 26:04.824
Why?

26:04.867 --> 26:06.477
I would have asked her
to join me for drinks

26:06.521 --> 26:10.046
like a civilized person,
but she's just so uncivilized.

26:10.090 --> 26:11.961
I wanted to spend
a little time

26:12.005 --> 26:14.442
with my daughter-in-law
while I had the chance.

26:14.485 --> 26:15.835
Are you going somewhere?

26:15.878 --> 26:17.097
I'm not going
anywhere, but Alexis

26:17.140 --> 26:18.968
doesn't stay
anywhere for long.

26:19.012 --> 26:22.058
Oh, I'm pretty confident
she's not leaving anytime soon.

26:22.102 --> 26:24.060
Sweetheart,
you are going to need

26:24.104 --> 26:26.062
more than confidence
to handle Alexis.

26:26.106 --> 26:27.629
Perhaps a sharp weapon.

26:27.673 --> 26:29.196
How do you know
she's not the one

26:29.239 --> 26:31.981
who suggested the toxic
paint plan to Adam?

26:32.025 --> 26:34.288
Okay, is it possible
that you've gotten more crazy?

26:34.331 --> 26:36.725
If worrying about
my son is crazy,

26:36.769 --> 26:38.901
I don't want to be sane.

26:38.945 --> 26:42.035
Alexis will do
whatever she has to

26:42.078 --> 26:45.647
to get her hands on the
money and status she's lost.

26:45.691 --> 26:47.083
Just don't turn
your back on her.

26:47.127 --> 26:49.782
If you're forcing me to choose
between you and Alexis,

26:49.825 --> 26:51.827
I choose my wife.

26:51.871 --> 26:54.961
Your plan to break us up
is about as subtle as your robe.

26:56.005 --> 26:58.312
Have a good night.

27:03.360 --> 27:04.971
He sounded pissed.

27:05.014 --> 27:07.974
He'll get over it when
he sees her for what she is.

27:08.017 --> 27:11.673
He just needs a little help
to realize it.

27:13.109 --> 27:14.545
How much do I owe you?

27:14.589 --> 27:16.025
Oh, you're far from done.

27:16.069 --> 27:18.245
That was just phase one,
the primer.

27:18.288 --> 27:20.247
You wouldn't put
just one coat on a house.

27:20.290 --> 27:21.901
Why would you on your body?

27:21.944 --> 27:24.817
I don't know, Becky, I hire
people to paint things for me.

27:24.860 --> 27:25.948
How many phases are there?

27:25.992 --> 27:27.820
Four. Each one
takes an hour.

27:27.863 --> 27:29.082
Does everyone do all four?

27:29.125 --> 27:30.953
Everyone. It's the only option.

27:30.997 --> 27:33.695
I'm on the speed dial
of the one percent for a reason.

27:33.739 --> 27:36.480
My tan is known
as the fountain of youth.

27:36.524 --> 27:38.831
Oh, wait, you didn't just
spray lamb embryos on me

27:38.874 --> 27:40.136
or something, did you?

27:40.180 --> 27:41.181
That's so five years ago.

27:41.224 --> 27:42.835
But I do have
a secret ingredient.

27:42.878 --> 27:45.011
Which reminds me,
do you have any allergies?

27:45.054 --> 27:47.230
You mean, other than being
vulnerable around others

27:47.274 --> 27:48.449
and fresh pineapple?

27:48.492 --> 27:50.016
I was talking about hormones.

27:50.059 --> 27:51.844
Um, specifically antiaging.

27:51.887 --> 27:53.541
Oh, like human
growth hormone?

27:53.584 --> 27:55.935
My serum is
lightly infused with HGH.

27:55.978 --> 27:59.025
That's why you need four phases,
to implement slowly.

27:59.068 --> 28:01.723
It's a miracle drug.
People want to look young.

28:01.767 --> 28:03.420
Except for the FDA,
which doesn't allow it

28:03.464 --> 28:04.987
because it's
supposedly dangerous.

28:05.031 --> 28:06.380
But I think they have it...Okay, Becky, Becky, Becky.

28:06.423 --> 28:08.121
Stop talking. I don't
need to know any of that.

28:08.164 --> 28:09.600
You're telling me

28:09.644 --> 28:12.255
that somebody who had
a 6:00 p.m. with you

28:12.299 --> 28:15.563
could never be home and
in the bath by 9:00?

28:15.606 --> 28:18.000
Absolutely not.
And they wouldn't get wet.

28:18.044 --> 28:19.959
You can't bathe
for six hours after,

28:20.002 --> 28:22.744
or you're washing thousands
of dollars down the drain.

28:22.788 --> 28:26.792
Oh, that golden goddess of lies.

28:31.361 --> 28:34.974
Your Honor, the defense calls
Alexis Carrington Colby

28:35.017 --> 28:36.453
to the stand.

28:39.152 --> 28:40.588
FALLON:
This is it.

28:40.631 --> 28:42.242
My one shot to keep my father
from wearing a onesie

28:42.285 --> 28:43.722
for the rest of his life.

28:43.765 --> 28:45.506
At least you're doing it
for the right reasons.

28:45.549 --> 28:46.637
Hmm.

28:49.466 --> 28:52.556
Mrs. Colby, would you walk
the court through your timeline

28:52.600 --> 28:54.471
on the night of March 15 again?

28:54.515 --> 28:56.082
I'm sure it's in the transcript.

28:59.433 --> 29:01.391
But I will repeat it.

29:01.435 --> 29:05.134
As I already explained,
I had my hair done at 6:00.

29:05.178 --> 29:06.788
Then I went home,
wrapped it in a turban

29:06.832 --> 29:09.269
and took a bath,
like I do every night.

29:09.312 --> 29:10.357
While having a cocktail?

29:10.400 --> 29:12.402
Yes, a dry martini
with one olive.

29:12.446 --> 29:13.969
Two if I'm hungry.

29:14.013 --> 29:16.015
Please continue.

29:16.058 --> 29:17.494
I had just closed my eyes

29:17.538 --> 29:19.627
when I heard
a bloodcurdling scream

29:19.670 --> 29:21.585
that I will never forget.

29:21.629 --> 29:24.763
And that's when I saw...
the murder.

29:25.807 --> 29:27.548
And you're sure about this?

29:27.591 --> 29:30.507
That you saw my client
doing this

29:30.551 --> 29:32.422
on that night?

29:32.466 --> 29:35.469
If that's the day
that Mack was killed, then yes.

29:35.512 --> 29:38.211
I can't change
the things that I've seen

29:38.254 --> 29:40.039
or when I've seen them.Of course.

29:40.082 --> 29:42.955
So, just checking.
You were not at a tanning salon

29:42.998 --> 29:44.826
with a woman named Becky
on the night

29:44.870 --> 29:47.611
you claim to have seen
my client kill Mack?

29:47.655 --> 29:49.875
ALEXIS:
It was nine months ago,

29:49.918 --> 29:52.051
but I've been taking
ginkgo biloba

29:52.094 --> 29:55.576
for my memory daily for years,
so I'm confident in saying

29:55.619 --> 29:57.447
I don't think so.

29:57.491 --> 29:59.580
If I were to put Becky
on the stand

29:59.623 --> 30:01.800
to testify under oath,

30:01.843 --> 30:05.281
would she say she saw you
on March 15?

30:05.325 --> 30:08.241
My beauty appointments
are plentiful,

30:08.284 --> 30:10.417
and I rarely get them mixed up,

30:10.460 --> 30:14.290
but I suppose it's possible.

30:14.334 --> 30:16.597
But a spray tan
only takes one hour,

30:16.640 --> 30:19.513
so even if I did confuse
the two appointments,

30:19.556 --> 30:21.080
I still would have been home
by 9:00.

30:21.123 --> 30:23.822
Uh... Mitchell. Mitchell.

30:32.134 --> 30:34.397
Isn't it true
that Becky's spray tan

30:34.441 --> 30:37.009
takes four hours to complete?BROWN:
Objection!

30:37.052 --> 30:40.055
The witness has already stated
that a spray tan takes one hour.

30:40.099 --> 30:41.883
And why are we even talking
about spray tans?

30:41.927 --> 30:43.406
This is ridiculous.

30:43.450 --> 30:45.626
Because I tracked
Becky down!

30:45.669 --> 30:46.932
Which is why I look so good.

30:46.975 --> 30:48.237
And I highly recommend it.

30:48.281 --> 30:49.673
But I digress.

30:49.717 --> 30:53.199
I know that you were getting
your spray tan at 6:00.

30:53.242 --> 30:54.287
JUDGE:
Ms. Carrington.

30:54.330 --> 30:55.766
And I know that
Becky's spray tan

30:55.810 --> 30:56.985
takes four hours,

30:57.029 --> 30:58.508
because it contains HGH

30:58.552 --> 30:59.945
and it needs time to work.

30:59.988 --> 31:01.772
So there is no way
you could have been at home

31:01.816 --> 31:04.732
at 9:00, because you
would not be done until 10:00.

31:04.775 --> 31:05.864
Asked and answered.

31:05.907 --> 31:07.300
Objection sustained.

31:07.343 --> 31:08.518
No further questions,
Your Honor.

31:08.562 --> 31:09.780
Order!

31:09.824 --> 31:12.871
Ms. Carrington, please sit down.

31:14.046 --> 31:16.178
Wait till you start showing
signs of age.

31:16.222 --> 31:18.267
You'll do anything
to reverse the clock.

31:18.311 --> 31:20.966
Especially
when your...

31:21.009 --> 31:23.577
mind is as fuzzy as mine can be.

31:25.971 --> 31:28.625
The defense rests.

31:31.628 --> 31:32.978
No, no, no, no, no.

31:33.021 --> 31:35.110
I can't be smudged.Well, what I want to do to you

31:35.154 --> 31:37.112
right now might be worth
a splotchy tan.

31:40.768 --> 31:42.378
Okay. That's it.Really?

31:42.422 --> 31:44.380
No.Really? Okay.

31:45.773 --> 31:47.644
Thank you
for helping me.

31:47.688 --> 31:48.776
Yeah.

31:48.819 --> 31:51.126
What do you think
the jury's thinking?

31:52.432 --> 31:54.390
Well,

31:54.434 --> 31:57.306
I can't imagine
those people have much sympathy

31:57.350 --> 31:59.308
for the billionaire
with the young wife

31:59.352 --> 32:01.876
and the...
great-looking daughter.

32:01.920 --> 32:04.705
I mean, you did
everything you could.

32:05.749 --> 32:07.751
Now it's out of your hands.

32:08.752 --> 32:11.625
And that is something
I am not comfortable with.

32:11.668 --> 32:13.627
I mean, they've been
deliberating for two hours.

32:13.670 --> 32:15.629
Is it good or is it bad?

32:15.672 --> 32:17.631
I just...

32:17.674 --> 32:21.504
I can't imagine what my father
must be going through right now.

32:27.597 --> 32:28.642
JUDGE:
Foreperson,

32:28.685 --> 32:29.817
do you have a verdict?

32:32.733 --> 32:33.690
No, Your Honor.

32:33.734 --> 32:34.953
We're deadlocked.

32:34.996 --> 32:37.781
And you think that there's
no reasonable chance

32:37.825 --> 32:40.262
that you'll come to a verdict
with more discussion?

32:40.306 --> 32:41.568
No, I do not.

32:41.611 --> 32:43.526
We have a hung jury.

32:43.570 --> 32:47.313
Therefore, this case
is deemed a mistrial.

32:49.054 --> 32:51.056
Over a spray tan? You've
got to be kidding me.

32:51.099 --> 32:52.666
JUDGE:
Order! Order!

32:52.709 --> 32:55.843
Shall we set a date for the
prosecution to retry the case?

32:55.886 --> 32:58.150
We need to discuss this
amongst ourselves.

32:58.193 --> 33:00.543
Will the defendant
please rise?

33:00.587 --> 33:02.589
Mr. Carrington,
you are free to go

33:02.632 --> 33:04.417
until further notice.

33:06.419 --> 33:08.247
Court is adjourned.

33:11.641 --> 33:14.470
Congratulations, baby.

33:15.732 --> 33:17.604
Come on. Let's get out
of here and celebrate.

33:17.647 --> 33:20.085
Celebrate?
A hung jury means

33:20.128 --> 33:21.782
that some of those people
think you're guilty.

33:21.825 --> 33:23.479
What if they retry you?

33:23.523 --> 33:26.047
With no solid evidence
or eyewitness testimony,

33:26.091 --> 33:28.006
there's no way that'll happen.

33:28.049 --> 33:30.225
Thank you. Really.

33:30.269 --> 33:32.445
Couldn't have done this
without your help.Well,

33:32.488 --> 33:34.795
if a daughter can't save her
father from the death penalty

33:34.838 --> 33:37.711
by exposing her mother's lies,
then what good is she?

33:48.939 --> 33:50.680
ALEXIS:
I hope you're proud of yourself.

33:50.724 --> 33:54.075
You ruined the life
of an innocent woman today.

33:54.119 --> 33:56.077
Aw, Mother, spare me.

33:56.121 --> 33:59.341
You have been called a lot
of things, but never innocent.

33:59.385 --> 34:00.777
I meant Becky.

34:00.821 --> 34:02.866
She's being investigated
on illegal drug charges,

34:02.910 --> 34:04.694
and they're shutting
down her business.

34:04.738 --> 34:07.088
The story is all
over Hot Tea Atlanta

34:07.132 --> 34:09.873
because of what you just
did to her in court.

34:09.917 --> 34:11.788
I was only trying to prove
that you were lying,

34:11.832 --> 34:13.877
which you were, to save Blake.

34:13.921 --> 34:15.792
I wasn't trying
to destroy Becky.

34:15.836 --> 34:18.012
She'll forgive me.
I'll explain everything to her.

34:18.056 --> 34:20.232
Yes. By all means,

34:20.275 --> 34:24.627
explain how you hurt an innocent
person to save a guilty one.

34:24.671 --> 34:27.195
You have got to let go
of this obsession with Blake.

34:27.239 --> 34:30.111
Fallon, your father
is a murderer.

34:30.155 --> 34:32.809
He told me to my face
that he did not kill Mack.

34:32.853 --> 34:34.115
And I believe him.

34:34.159 --> 34:35.899
Sweetheart,

34:35.943 --> 34:38.076
now you're the
innocent one.

34:44.038 --> 34:46.736
Sorry your plan
didn't work out.

34:46.780 --> 34:48.651
How is it
you look so well-rested

34:48.695 --> 34:50.566
when I can't imagine
you sleep a wink

34:50.610 --> 34:53.569
knowing you share the blood
of a savage killer?

34:53.613 --> 34:58.139
Aw. Losing is such an ugly
color on you, Alexis.

34:58.183 --> 34:59.445
Get out of my way.

35:21.641 --> 35:23.077
I'm sorry.

35:23.121 --> 35:25.601
I think
you dropped something.

35:36.308 --> 35:37.918
What's all this?

35:37.961 --> 35:39.180
Private party?

35:39.224 --> 35:40.312
It's for you.

35:40.355 --> 35:42.183
There never was
a project.

35:42.227 --> 35:44.316
I wanted to ask you out
on a date.

35:44.359 --> 35:47.232
But when you assumed
it was for work, I...

35:47.275 --> 35:48.276
Panicked.

35:48.320 --> 35:49.886
I thought
you weren't interested.

35:49.930 --> 35:52.672
I know we only had
one kiss, but...

35:52.715 --> 35:53.803
it was a good kiss.

35:53.847 --> 35:55.370
I'll admit, I was bummed

35:55.414 --> 35:57.329
when you said
you needed to talk work,

35:57.372 --> 35:58.504
but it does present
a problem.

35:58.547 --> 36:00.375
Now what?

36:00.419 --> 36:02.029
I don't date clients.

36:02.072 --> 36:03.857
Even cute ones.

36:03.900 --> 36:05.467
Especially the cute ones.

36:05.511 --> 36:07.208
Well, that is
a problem.

36:07.252 --> 36:08.209
Oh.

36:08.253 --> 36:09.863
Wait.

36:09.906 --> 36:12.474
You're fired.

36:21.527 --> 36:22.919
ADAM:
Father,

36:22.963 --> 36:24.660
first of all, I hear
congratulations are in order.

36:24.704 --> 36:26.227
Freedom must feel amazing.Yeah.

36:26.271 --> 36:28.925
Well, it did,
until about three seconds ago.

36:28.969 --> 36:30.536
Can I help you?

36:30.579 --> 36:31.580
So, I know
you're still angry with me,

36:31.624 --> 36:32.712
which is
completely understandable.

36:32.755 --> 36:34.757
But since
I couldn't save Blue Belt,

36:34.801 --> 36:36.237
I did the next
best thing.

36:36.281 --> 36:38.021
I bought you a new vineyard.

36:38.065 --> 36:39.501
Next door. Same soil.

36:39.545 --> 36:41.329
Why would you do that?
I don't want another vineyard.

36:41.373 --> 36:44.593
Blue Belt actually meant
something to me.

36:44.637 --> 36:46.943
I wanted to create something
for this family

36:46.987 --> 36:49.946
that would be part
of the Carrington legacy.

36:49.990 --> 36:52.035
A legacy you
clearly don't understand.

36:52.079 --> 36:54.777
I do. And if I've learned
anything from you,

36:54.821 --> 36:56.518
it's that when
our best-laid plans fail,

36:56.562 --> 36:57.737
we pivot.

36:57.780 --> 36:59.521
It wasn't my plan
to destroy my vineyard.

36:59.565 --> 37:01.001
That was all you.

37:03.133 --> 37:05.484
Dad, I-I just spent
my entire life savings

37:05.527 --> 37:07.268
on 180 acres for you.

37:07.312 --> 37:08.269
I didn't ask you to.

37:08.313 --> 37:10.271
I don't want it.

37:10.315 --> 37:12.012
Matter of fact, why don't
you pitch a tent on it,

37:12.055 --> 37:13.056
'cause I want you out
of the manor.

37:13.100 --> 37:15.058
What?

37:15.102 --> 37:17.626
I j--
I just came in here

37:17.670 --> 37:19.062
to ask your
forgiveness.

37:19.106 --> 37:20.890
And I'm telling you no!

37:20.934 --> 37:23.371
You're lucky I don't cut
you out of the will.

37:23.415 --> 37:26.026
But the price of Blue Belt will
come out of your inheritance.

37:26.069 --> 37:27.288
I already know
I'm cut out of the will.

37:27.332 --> 37:29.769
Nadia saw it! She told me!

37:29.812 --> 37:32.032
Hmm.

37:32.075 --> 37:33.947
Right.

37:33.990 --> 37:36.166
She lied about that, too.

37:37.777 --> 37:41.084
You're an even bigger fool
than I thought you were.

37:41.128 --> 37:43.913
And you are ruining
my celebratory mood.

37:43.957 --> 37:46.394
I want you out of the manor
before the end of the day.

37:54.228 --> 37:56.099
Of course.

37:56.143 --> 37:57.927
Okay. Buh-bye.

37:59.364 --> 38:01.235
This is unacceptable.

38:01.279 --> 38:03.150
Mimi Rose just
uninvited me

38:03.193 --> 38:05.065
to the Peachtree Society's
annual fashion show.

38:05.108 --> 38:07.328
She says she thinks I'm
gonna be a distraction.

38:07.372 --> 38:10.157
It's all over
Atlanta society websites.

38:10.200 --> 38:14.204
They are calling me
Alexis "Stair-ington" Colby.

38:14.248 --> 38:16.206
#BanisterBabe.

38:16.250 --> 38:18.426
#CourthouseCatfight.

38:18.470 --> 38:20.689
Ooh, #DominiqueDown.

38:20.733 --> 38:22.125
I like that one.

38:22.169 --> 38:23.953
I realize I already asked,

38:23.997 --> 38:26.347
but you didn't push her,
did you?

38:26.391 --> 38:27.957
I know Dom can
be annoying.

38:28.001 --> 38:30.612
Jeff, I am much smarter
than that.

38:30.656 --> 38:32.048
When I hurt someone,

38:32.092 --> 38:34.181
it is years
before they know it's me.

38:36.226 --> 38:38.490
Oh, speak
of the devil.

38:38.533 --> 38:40.143
It does feel hotter
than hell in here.

38:40.187 --> 38:42.581
Though it could be the probable
nerve damage you caused me.

38:42.624 --> 38:43.843
So stay away from me.

38:43.886 --> 38:46.280
And don't worry. I just
came to say goodbye.

38:46.324 --> 38:47.542
Fine. You said it.

38:47.586 --> 38:49.196
Well, you all right?
Where are you going?

38:49.239 --> 38:50.806
New York.

38:50.850 --> 38:52.939
All of this aggressive energy
isn't good for my recovery.

38:52.982 --> 38:54.941
It makes my
muscles tense.

38:54.984 --> 38:57.683
I barely touched you.

38:58.727 --> 38:59.641
I'm scared for my life.

38:59.685 --> 39:01.382
I don't want
to be around you.

39:01.426 --> 39:04.385
Hopefully, you feel the same
way by the time I get back.

39:04.429 --> 39:06.518
Oh, please, come give
Mommy a hug goodbye.

39:06.561 --> 39:08.650
Oh. Oh.

39:08.694 --> 39:10.478
And don't worry,

39:10.522 --> 39:12.654
I'll return,
and when I do,

39:12.698 --> 39:14.569
don't turn your back on
me. : Bitch.

39:14.613 --> 39:16.615
Bye, love.

39:27.582 --> 39:29.454
Blake said you've been banished.

39:29.497 --> 39:31.020
Well, the loft
isn't Blake's property.

39:31.064 --> 39:32.239
Belongs to Alexis.

39:32.282 --> 39:33.371
A real estate loophole.

39:35.677 --> 39:37.984
Please
don't tell anyone.

39:38.027 --> 39:39.638
Lucky for you,

39:39.681 --> 39:42.641
I carry my share
of secrets.

39:42.684 --> 39:43.859
And guilt.

39:43.903 --> 39:45.295
The night that you
were kidnapped

39:45.339 --> 39:46.471
was on my watch.

39:46.514 --> 39:48.560
I've never
forgiven myself.

39:48.603 --> 39:50.736
Now Kirby's out there somewhere,

39:50.779 --> 39:52.825
upset with me.

39:52.868 --> 39:55.567
A father's supposed to
protect his children.

39:55.610 --> 39:57.612
I failed then and now.

39:57.656 --> 39:59.440
It's not your fault.No, I...

39:59.484 --> 40:00.833
should've stood up for Kirby

40:00.876 --> 40:02.443
when Blake was accusing her
of being a traitor.

40:02.487 --> 40:04.837
Well, when she gets back,
you'll make peace.

40:04.880 --> 40:08.275
Tell her you won't turn
your back on her again.

40:10.712 --> 40:12.714
Oh, don't worry.

40:14.063 --> 40:15.848
Blake will see
the error of his ways.

40:15.891 --> 40:17.371
I suppose
if he doesn't,

40:17.415 --> 40:18.851
I always have Mother.

40:22.158 --> 40:24.160
Thanks.No problem.

40:30.384 --> 40:32.647
Put down the muffin, Cristal.

40:32.691 --> 40:34.127
Excuse me?

40:34.170 --> 40:36.564
Daddy's lawyers drafted this.

40:36.608 --> 40:39.088
Mack's family agreed
they wouldn't file a civil suit

40:39.132 --> 40:40.481
or bring this mess up ever again

40:40.525 --> 40:42.091
if Daddy admitted
his guilt.

40:42.135 --> 40:43.876
I'm sure there was a healthy
exchange of cash involved,

40:43.919 --> 40:46.182
but... when isn't there?

40:46.226 --> 40:48.489
Where did you even get this?Well,

40:48.533 --> 40:49.708
you know us Carringtons.

40:49.751 --> 40:52.058
We share everything,
especially lawyers.

40:52.101 --> 40:53.712
And, I mean, what's the point
in getting away with murder

40:53.755 --> 40:55.801
if you have to pay someone
for it later, right?

40:55.844 --> 40:57.672
I just hope it was worth it.

41:00.849 --> 41:04.200
I was so broken
after the baby died.

41:05.245 --> 41:07.639
Blake couldn't control
his rage.

41:07.682 --> 41:09.684
He lost it.

41:10.816 --> 41:14.646
It's weird that he signed this
without telling me.

41:15.690 --> 41:19.259
I have been forging Blake's
signature since fourth grade.

41:19.302 --> 41:21.783
So the reason he didn't tell
you about it is because

41:21.827 --> 41:23.045
he didn't sign it.

41:23.089 --> 41:25.874
In fact, I didn't know for sure

41:25.918 --> 41:28.442
that Blake killed Mack
until you just told me.

41:29.878 --> 41:33.186
I guess we finally have
something in common, Cristal.

41:33.229 --> 41:36.798
We both helped someone
get away with murder.
