01:42.182 --> 01:43.916
- Keep him steady.
- Watch the corner.

01:43.951 --> 01:46.151
I got it.

01:49.055 --> 01:51.090
<i>Watch the door.</i>

02:05.103 --> 02:07.805
How's he still alive after
three days out in the cold?

02:07.839 --> 02:09.607
He's fat.

02:09.640 --> 02:11.108
The fuck's that
supposed to mean?

02:11.142 --> 02:13.543
He's insulated. I don't know.
How should I know?

02:13.577 --> 02:16.578
The cold and the buckshot.
I'm not a doctor.

02:16.612 --> 02:18.045
Really?

02:19.548 --> 02:21.415
I thought we killed them all.

02:21.449 --> 02:24.283
He thought.
Fuckin' Aristotle.

02:24.318 --> 02:26.285
So what are they doing to him?

02:26.319 --> 02:27.786
What difference does it make?

02:27.820 --> 02:31.222
This guy's got a hole in his
belly big as a grapefruit.

02:31.256 --> 02:32.890
He thaws out a little...
he's a goner.

02:32.924 --> 02:35.959
- So now you're a doctor.
- What are you mad at me for?

02:35.993 --> 02:37.527
I'm late.

02:37.561 --> 02:40.629
Let nature take its course.
Help it along if you can.

02:40.663 --> 02:43.464
And you'd better hope
he dies real soon.

03:12.255 --> 03:16.190
Yah! Yah!

03:18.459 --> 03:21.261
Quick now, close them doors.

03:21.296 --> 03:22.997
About time, eh?

03:23.031 --> 03:25.399
Yeah, well, this nag
isn't exactly man o' war.

03:25.433 --> 03:28.235
You didn't happen to run at
Saratoga last summer, did you?

03:28.269 --> 03:30.237
Let's go.
Open it up.

03:35.709 --> 03:37.610
I'ma do a bottle count
as soon as we're done.

03:37.645 --> 03:39.412
And for every drop
goes missing,

03:39.446 --> 03:41.947
I'ma take a drop of blood
out of one of y'all asses.

03:41.981 --> 03:43.282
Simon Legree.

03:43.316 --> 03:45.717
I don't give a fuck
they agree or not.

03:46.685 --> 03:48.886
So what do you think, Chalky?

03:48.920 --> 03:51.488
I can mix this up real nice.

03:51.523 --> 03:54.223
500 bottles will get you 3000.

03:56.593 --> 03:58.793
So how're we working the split?

03:58.827 --> 04:01.729
Assuming this batch goes
well... 80-20, my favor.

04:01.763 --> 04:04.898
I supply the product; You and
your people work your magic.

04:04.932 --> 04:08.903
That's a whole lot of magic
for only 20%.

04:08.937 --> 04:10.605
It's the same deal
I gave Mickey Cusick.

04:12.574 --> 04:15.475
Did you know that motherfucker
changed his name to Doyle?

04:15.510 --> 04:17.510
I did.

04:17.545 --> 04:19.545
40%.

04:19.579 --> 04:22.314
- What happened to 30?
- I charged you 10% extra

04:22.348 --> 04:24.450
for thinking I'd take
the same deal as Mickey.

04:24.484 --> 04:26.084
I didn't realize
you were so sensitive.

04:26.118 --> 04:28.419
As a baby's ass, motherfucker.

04:30.722 --> 04:32.422
Let's call it 35.

04:34.391 --> 04:36.792
We in business.

04:38.294 --> 04:40.762
Come on now, hurry up.

04:40.796 --> 04:43.798
What's "motherfucker" mean?

04:43.833 --> 04:46.934
I suppose it's a shvartze word.

04:49.704 --> 04:52.437
You want two of them right now?
Let me get that.

04:59.045 --> 05:01.445
Why aren't you eating?

05:01.479 --> 05:03.146
I'm not hungry.

05:03.181 --> 05:04.781
You need your strength back.

05:04.815 --> 05:07.450
I'm stronger
than I look, Edith.

05:07.484 --> 05:10.286
I suppose you'd have to be,
after what you put up with.

05:12.222 --> 05:14.422
I'm considering
taking in a boarder.

05:14.457 --> 05:17.057
What, some burlesque performer?

05:18.960 --> 05:21.694
Come stay with me if you like.

05:21.729 --> 05:24.764
Thank you.
We couldn't.

05:27.533 --> 05:29.434
What about your own people?

05:29.468 --> 05:33.103
Have you thought
about going home?

05:33.138 --> 05:36.039
I came to this country
for a better life.

05:36.073 --> 05:39.576
When's the baby coming, mama?

05:41.679 --> 05:44.280
I don't know, dear.

05:44.315 --> 05:48.016
The stork
must have gotten lost.

05:48.051 --> 05:50.018
Eat your egg.

05:51.954 --> 05:55.255
I'm gonna make you a brisket,

05:55.290 --> 05:57.324
some potatoes on the side.

05:57.358 --> 05:59.592
That'd be lovely.

06:08.967 --> 06:11.268
- Mrs. Schroeder?
- Who are you?

06:11.302 --> 06:14.138
I'm Mrs. Schroeder.

06:14.172 --> 06:16.974
A job for you
from Mr. Thompson.

06:17.008 --> 06:20.743
My deepest condolences
on account of your husband.

06:26.784 --> 06:30.020
"Belle femme.
The Ritz-Carlton."

06:30.054 --> 06:32.255
Sounds fancy.
What is it?

06:32.290 --> 06:35.257
A shop, I suppose.

06:35.292 --> 06:37.626
It's French.

06:37.660 --> 06:40.929
And how do you know
a man like Nucky Thompson?

06:40.963 --> 06:43.330
Through a friend.

06:43.365 --> 06:46.500
The temperance league.

06:48.103 --> 06:50.270
I'll need you to look
after the children.

06:50.304 --> 06:53.873
Those French...
I've read about them.

06:57.744 --> 07:00.378
All right.
You all set?

07:00.412 --> 07:02.747
That wound needs attention.

07:02.781 --> 07:04.515
Later.
I need to question him.

07:04.549 --> 07:06.683
This man is gravely ill.

07:06.718 --> 07:08.818
He has a massive
internal infection.

07:08.853 --> 07:10.987
I'll just be a few minutes.

07:25.667 --> 07:28.201
What did he do, officer?

07:28.236 --> 07:30.003
Go to sleep.

08:01.529 --> 08:05.198
<i>What's that?</i>

08:07.434 --> 08:09.234
What did you say?

08:13.639 --> 08:15.773
<i>What's going on
over there?</i>

08:15.807 --> 08:20.243
So what do you know about
Saturday night's events?

08:20.278 --> 08:22.579
Is he all right?

08:26.083 --> 08:28.183
You don't say.

08:28.218 --> 08:29.518
How many men?

08:32.821 --> 08:34.889
You can't go in there.

08:35.924 --> 08:37.725
You can't go in there.

08:50.336 --> 08:51.936
Poor bastard.

08:58.008 --> 08:59.542
Sir?

08:59.577 --> 09:02.178
<i>Sir, can you hear me?</i>

09:02.213 --> 09:04.680
He needs his rest.
He has a massive infection.

09:04.715 --> 09:06.048
And I need to speak with him.

09:06.082 --> 09:07.816
No interviews.
This witness is in my custody.

09:07.850 --> 09:10.951
We're over the Pennsylvania border,
which makes the locus federal.

09:10.985 --> 09:13.520
Says you with all your
fancy talk.

09:14.689 --> 09:16.490
Go on now.
Shoo.

09:16.525 --> 09:18.926
You're obstructing a federal
investigation, sheriff.

09:18.960 --> 09:20.560
Yeah?
So get a warrant.

09:25.165 --> 09:28.366
Stay here
and guard this witness.

09:46.750 --> 09:49.217
Jeez.

10:04.531 --> 10:06.532
Almost there.
Hold still.

10:10.168 --> 10:11.969
Jesus, if I knew
this was the cure,

10:12.004 --> 10:13.737
I'd have taken my chances
fighting the huns.

10:13.771 --> 10:15.805
You should've thought of that
before intentionally

10:15.839 --> 10:17.707
exposing yourself
to gonorrhea, Mr. Luciano.

10:23.547 --> 10:26.514
The good news is

10:26.549 --> 10:30.450
<i>the zinc sulfate treatments
have worked.</i>

10:30.485 --> 10:32.151
Your symptoms have abated?

10:32.186 --> 10:33.953
Yeah.

10:33.988 --> 10:37.223
The faucet stopped dripping,
if that's what you mean.

10:37.258 --> 10:40.760
And urination...
any burning, itching?

10:40.795 --> 10:43.797
Nothing I can't take.
It's just...

10:44.699 --> 10:47.500
What?

10:49.870 --> 10:53.073
Sometimes I...

10:53.107 --> 10:55.208
I don't know.

10:58.145 --> 11:00.379
It's like when I'm doing it,

11:00.414 --> 11:03.215
or trying to do it

11:03.250 --> 11:04.883
with a broad...

11:04.918 --> 11:06.585
Yes?

11:06.619 --> 11:09.254
Well...

11:09.289 --> 11:11.356
It starts out fine,

11:11.391 --> 11:13.658
and then it goes away.

11:13.693 --> 11:15.593
Your penis becomes flaccid?

11:15.628 --> 11:17.261
Come again?

11:17.296 --> 11:19.796
It doesn't stay hard.

11:23.366 --> 11:24.567
Sometimes, yeah.
Ah, uh-huh.

11:24.601 --> 11:26.101
Whoa.

11:26.136 --> 11:27.903
What are you doing?
What, are you writing a book?

11:27.937 --> 11:29.905
Mr. Luciano, I need
to document your recovery,

11:29.939 --> 11:31.740
the course of treatment.

11:31.775 --> 11:33.543
Forget it.
I'm fine.

11:33.577 --> 11:36.345
- Forget I said nothin'.
- But...

11:36.379 --> 11:38.180
Look, you hear what I says
or what?

11:38.214 --> 11:40.182
Huh?

11:54.655 --> 11:56.622
Sure, put me down for a grand.

11:58.225 --> 12:00.226
Well, it's a wonderful cause.

12:02.729 --> 12:05.029
Righty-o.
I'm glad I could help.

12:06.799 --> 12:09.066
Who're you giving money to now?

12:09.101 --> 12:10.634
Nobody.

12:10.669 --> 12:13.103
The premature baby hospital.

12:13.137 --> 12:14.704
On the boardwalk?

12:14.739 --> 12:17.707
Did I say I was finished?

12:22.778 --> 12:25.480
That place
gives me the willies.

12:27.249 --> 12:31.185
You were so smart
not to have children.

12:40.360 --> 12:42.628
You know, flo's in town.

12:42.662 --> 12:45.297
- Who?
- Ziegfeld.

12:45.331 --> 12:48.567
Eddie says he's casting for
the "nine o'clock frolic."

12:48.601 --> 12:50.902
- My Eddie?
- Eddie Cantor.

12:50.936 --> 12:52.570
Oh.

12:52.605 --> 12:54.405
I thought you were done
with all that.

12:54.439 --> 12:56.106
Do you want me to be?

12:56.141 --> 12:58.742
Whatever makes you happy, kid.

13:00.011 --> 13:02.645
You make me happy.

13:05.015 --> 13:09.284
You know,

13:09.318 --> 13:12.853
I'd have a baby
if that's what you want.

13:12.888 --> 13:14.021
What?

13:14.055 --> 13:16.323
It'd ruin my figure,

13:16.357 --> 13:18.558
but if that's what you want...

13:21.295 --> 13:23.729
Don't you think
I'd make a good mommy?

13:23.763 --> 13:26.632
Well, sure you would...
swell.

13:26.666 --> 13:28.600
You have a very loving
disposition.

13:28.634 --> 13:30.135
So?

13:30.169 --> 13:31.969
This is a hotel.

13:32.004 --> 13:34.405
I'm not set up here for a baby.

13:35.874 --> 13:38.175
We could get a house
in cape may.

13:38.209 --> 13:39.876
Now's not a good time.

13:39.911 --> 13:42.312
Let's revisit this
after the election.

13:42.346 --> 13:44.280
Okay.

13:49.252 --> 13:51.252
Oh.

13:51.287 --> 13:53.187
<i>Oops.</i>

13:57.991 --> 14:01.426
<i>Mm, that's delicious.</i>

14:03.128 --> 14:06.664
That looks delicious too.

14:11.402 --> 14:13.170
Mm.

14:25.217 --> 14:27.018
How'd you get him
to sit so long?

14:27.052 --> 14:28.319
What?

14:29.254 --> 14:30.554
<i>Oh, I don't know.</i>

14:30.588 --> 14:33.290
The photographer
made him laugh.

14:33.324 --> 14:36.325
He said he's one of the best-looking
children he's ever seen.

14:36.360 --> 14:38.627
Yeah, that's how
they get your money.

14:38.661 --> 14:40.828
You don't think
your son's handsome?

14:40.862 --> 14:43.464
Sure he is...

14:43.498 --> 14:46.232
I mean, with you for a mother.

14:47.467 --> 14:49.934
Let's go find
the other people.

15:00.443 --> 15:03.311
It's hard to believe
he was ever this little.

15:04.447 --> 15:06.347
Three years is a long time.

15:12.519 --> 15:15.820
You don't like
the vacuum sweeper?

15:15.854 --> 15:18.022
<i>It just makes
such a racket.</i>

15:18.056 --> 15:20.391
- It's more efficient.
- It scares Tommy.

15:20.425 --> 15:23.460
All in the name of progress.

15:24.794 --> 15:26.762
You know they have a gun now

15:26.796 --> 15:28.796
that shoots 600 bullets
in a minute?

15:28.831 --> 15:30.631
Lovely.

15:30.666 --> 15:33.835
The Lewis gun.
I used one at Saint-Mihiel.

15:36.871 --> 15:39.406
We used to talk about books.

15:46.017 --> 15:49.554
<i>You are too thin.</i>

15:49.588 --> 15:51.489
When do you last bathe?

15:51.523 --> 15:53.491
Beg your pardon?

15:53.525 --> 15:55.892
Do you bathe?
When?

15:55.927 --> 15:57.994
Yes.
Uh, yesterday.

15:58.028 --> 16:01.130
Good. You must bathe
once a week at a minimum...

16:01.164 --> 16:05.434
Your hair as well,
and fingernails each day.

16:05.468 --> 16:07.369
You will not dirty our garments

16:07.403 --> 16:10.338
or cause them to stench.

16:10.372 --> 16:12.373
You've worked before in a shop?

16:12.407 --> 16:16.276
No, ma'am.
I was a servant.

16:16.310 --> 16:17.910
The last girl, Rosalie...

16:17.944 --> 16:20.179
four years of experience.

16:20.213 --> 16:22.347
What became of her?

16:22.382 --> 16:24.349
Mr. Thompson.
She had to be...

16:24.383 --> 16:27.051
How to say? Jettison
to give the job for you.

16:27.085 --> 16:29.887
I'm sorry.
I didn't know.

16:29.921 --> 16:31.555
You're sorry?

16:33.124 --> 16:35.792
What are to be my duties,
Madame Jeunet?

16:35.827 --> 16:38.028
<i>You are a dresser.</i>

16:38.062 --> 16:39.763
You will assist the customers

16:39.797 --> 16:41.631
<i>when they try the garments
on, n'est-ce pas?</i>

16:41.666 --> 16:45.102
<i>Occasionally you will
wear our merchandise</i>

16:45.136 --> 16:47.204
<i>so the customer
may visualize</i>

16:47.238 --> 16:50.273
what it looks like
not from the mannequin.

16:50.308 --> 16:52.208
<i>You will be prompt</i>

16:52.243 --> 16:54.611
<i>and you will work late
when I require.</i>

16:54.645 --> 16:56.379
<i>Parlez-vous francais?</i>

16:56.413 --> 17:00.116
No, ma'am.
Small phrases here and there.

17:00.151 --> 17:02.719
Yet I speak your English.

17:02.753 --> 17:03.853
Yes.

17:03.888 --> 17:05.621
<i>There you have it, non?</i>

17:05.656 --> 17:07.089
Daddy, look.

17:07.124 --> 17:09.724
In every event, you are
to be seen, not heard.

17:09.759 --> 17:11.059
- Yes, ma'am.
- Seen.

17:11.094 --> 17:12.426
You do not speak.

17:12.462 --> 17:14.596
<i>- Really?
- Yes.</i>

17:14.630 --> 17:16.263
<i>Well, let me try it.</i>

17:16.298 --> 17:18.699
<i>Change into this
immediatement.</i>

17:18.733 --> 17:20.901

from the federal magistrate
in Philadelphia

19:50.167 --> 19:52.101
giving me custody
and jurisdiction

19:52.135 --> 19:54.435
over the patient known as John Doe.
Any questions?

19:54.470 --> 19:56.770

to telephone somebody.

Telephone whoever you'd like.
Follow me, men.

20:01.809 --> 20:04.810
You're making a big mistake.

20:07.813 --> 20:10.215
Me on, push him in.

20:12.252 --> 20:14.786
A writ of certiorari?
Jesus Christ, boss.

20:14.821 --> 20:16.321
Don't take the lord's name
in vain.

20:16.355 --> 20:19.590
For Christ... we just broke
about a dozen laws.

20:19.625 --> 20:21.325
Down here?
What laws?

20:21.359 --> 20:24.227
Here, gentlemen,
buy yourselves a hot meal.

20:24.262 --> 20:26.396
Hey hey hey,
come on, come on.

20:28.265 --> 20:31.333
Jeez, what a tub of lard, eh?

20:31.368 --> 20:33.735
- Where are we even going?
- New York.

20:33.769 --> 20:36.337
He's one of Rothstein's men.

20:46.380 --> 20:49.481
Lift your cup up
a little higher.

20:49.516 --> 20:51.483
Rarr!

20:51.517 --> 20:54.586
Arr!

20:54.620 --> 20:56.621
I got you.

20:56.655 --> 20:58.455
I got you.

20:58.490 --> 21:00.123
Whoa whoa.

21:00.158 --> 21:02.058
Where're you going, pal?

21:05.862 --> 21:08.364
Tommy.
Tommy.

21:11.201 --> 21:13.402
What?
You wanna go inside?

21:13.436 --> 21:15.436
- Yeah.
- All right.

21:16.371 --> 21:18.906
Tommy my lad!

21:21.875 --> 21:23.309
I'm sorry, you're...?

21:23.343 --> 21:25.678
Oh.
There you go.

21:25.712 --> 21:28.112
Robert Dittrich.
A pleasure.

21:28.147 --> 21:30.348
You must be Jimmy.

21:30.382 --> 21:32.816
I'm Mary, Robert's wife.

21:32.850 --> 21:34.684
Jim Darmody.

21:36.053 --> 21:38.554
He's such a little love,
and photogenic.

21:38.588 --> 21:40.689
We are quite fond of him...

21:40.723 --> 21:42.491
Your wife too.

21:42.525 --> 21:44.659
We're not married
actually, but...

21:44.693 --> 21:46.627
Oh yes.

21:46.661 --> 21:48.061
Oh, my apologies.

21:48.096 --> 21:49.964
No, we're going to be.

21:49.998 --> 21:51.199
We're engaged.

21:51.233 --> 21:53.501
Oh. Well,
congratulations.

21:55.404 --> 21:57.538
I was away

21:57.572 --> 21:59.174
in the war.

21:59.208 --> 22:01.442
Oh, yes yes yes.
France, was it?

22:01.476 --> 22:02.944
The news accounts,

22:02.978 --> 22:05.446
<i>the battles at ypres
in particular...</i>

22:05.480 --> 22:07.347
some thrilling tales.

22:07.381 --> 22:10.549
I would not have minded having
my mettle tested like that.

22:11.884 --> 22:15.386
- We hear Paris is lovely.
- Ah, the Louvre.

22:15.420 --> 22:18.821
Didn't have a lot of time
to take in the sights.

22:19.756 --> 22:21.357
Would you care for some tea?

22:21.391 --> 22:23.558
No, we really should be going.
Come on, pal.

22:23.593 --> 22:25.493
No. No.

22:25.528 --> 22:27.295
Come on, let's go.

22:27.329 --> 22:29.030
<i>- It's lunchtime.
- No.</i>

22:29.064 --> 22:30.998
Tommy, come on.
Mama's waiting.

22:31.032 --> 22:34.033
- Be a good boy.
- Here.

22:34.067 --> 22:36.135
We'll visit another time, okay?

22:36.169 --> 22:38.737
<i>I got to do now.</i>

22:38.772 --> 22:40.806
Our best to Angela.

22:44.076 --> 22:46.176
Check his wrist.

22:47.545 --> 22:48.943
It's faint.

22:48.977 --> 22:51.378
It's 12:15.
We can make Bellevue by 5:00.

22:51.412 --> 22:53.279
- We're gonna lose him, sir.
- Don't you let him die.

22:53.314 --> 22:54.714
- Get back there.
- And do what?

22:54.748 --> 22:56.382
Slap him.
Wake him up.

22:59.419 --> 23:02.722
Who shot you?

23:02.756 --> 23:04.891
We have to find a doctor.

23:13.097 --> 23:15.229
Open.

23:15.264 --> 23:16.897
Wider, please.

23:16.932 --> 23:18.999
Mind Dr. Lissenger.

23:19.033 --> 23:21.034
You eat peanut brittle...
this is what happens.

23:21.068 --> 23:22.902
- Oh.
- What's the meaning of this?

23:22.936 --> 23:25.104
This man needs a doctor.
I'm a federal Agent.

23:25.138 --> 23:26.438
I'm a dentist.

23:26.472 --> 23:28.005
Out of the chair, kid, now!

23:28.040 --> 23:31.541
Okay, now you got
something to, you know,

23:31.576 --> 23:34.545
boost his system,
give him some pep?

23:34.579 --> 23:36.614
This man is dying.
He needs a surgeon.

23:36.648 --> 23:38.949
Well, you keep him alive!
I need to speak with him!

23:38.983 --> 23:40.716
Uh, cocaine.

23:40.751 --> 23:42.885
<i>It's an anesthetic.</i>

23:44.387 --> 23:47.723
I only know how to put it
in one place.

23:55.566 --> 23:57.468
What's taking so long?

23:57.502 --> 23:59.070
He needs a larger dose.

23:59.104 --> 24:00.971
What are you waiting for?

24:13.949 --> 24:17.085
All right, who shot you?
What'd he look like?

24:30.697 --> 24:32.998
<i>- What language is that?
- It's gutter German.</i>

24:33.032 --> 24:34.866
Yiddish.

24:34.900 --> 24:36.901
- What'd he say?
- I can't.

24:36.935 --> 24:38.769
- Mrs. Fishbaum.
- Word for word.

24:38.803 --> 24:40.671
This is a federal
investigation.

24:41.906 --> 24:45.875
He said you should
fuck your grandmother

24:45.909 --> 24:48.210
with your faggot penis.

24:48.244 --> 24:51.246
Little faggot penis.

25:05.193 --> 25:08.194
You want to die here
or at home?

25:11.030 --> 25:12.663
Tell me who it was.

25:14.533 --> 25:16.233
Good God, man.

25:22.206 --> 25:25.040
Come on.

25:27.110 --> 25:30.945
There...
there were t-t-two.

25:30.979 --> 25:32.947
Young.

25:32.981 --> 25:35.049
One thin.

25:35.083 --> 25:37.818
Did they talk, say anything?

25:47.027 --> 25:49.762
One...

25:49.796 --> 25:51.597
Jimmy.

25:51.631 --> 25:54.033
Fair-haired?

25:59.373 --> 26:02.775
Masks.
Masks.

26:11.286 --> 26:13.555
And the angel said,

26:13.589 --> 26:15.723
"if any man worship the beast,

26:15.758 --> 26:18.493
he shall drink of the wine
of the wrath of God

26:18.527 --> 26:20.428
and he shall be
tormented with fire

26:20.462 --> 26:22.297
<i>- in the presence of the lamb."</i>

26:22.331 --> 26:23.798
<i>- Isn't he Jewish?</i>

26:23.832 --> 26:25.667
"And the smoke of their
torment ascendeth up

26:25.701 --> 26:27.835
forever and ever;

26:27.869 --> 26:30.271
<i>And they shall have
no rest</i>

26:30.306 --> 26:32.240
day nor night,

26:32.275 --> 26:35.642
they who worship
the beast."

26:43.382 --> 26:45.616
He's all yours.

26:55.929 --> 26:57.196
Okay, gents.

26:57.230 --> 26:58.964
2000.

26:58.998 --> 27:01.065
Hand like a foot.

27:01.099 --> 27:02.799
That's it for me.

27:12.542 --> 27:15.211
I'll see your two

27:15.246 --> 27:17.680
and raise you two.

27:25.354 --> 27:28.055
What should I do here, Charlie?

27:35.430 --> 27:37.397
Depends on
what the other guy got.

27:37.431 --> 27:41.100
Depends on what
the other gentleman has.

27:41.134 --> 27:42.801
Right.

27:42.836 --> 27:44.936
Well?
What does he have?

27:44.971 --> 27:47.972
How should I know?
I'm no swami.

27:48.007 --> 27:51.208
The very reason this game
is so challenging.

27:52.377 --> 27:54.511
There's a lot of money
in that pot.

27:54.546 --> 27:56.446
How much do you think
is in there?

27:56.481 --> 27:57.814
Plenty.

27:57.848 --> 27:59.315
$22,500.

27:59.350 --> 28:00.783
That's right.

28:00.817 --> 28:02.751
How much mining equipment
do you have to sell

28:02.785 --> 28:04.486
to make 22 grand, buck?

28:04.520 --> 28:06.121
A lot.

28:06.156 --> 28:08.757
Now are you gonna call or fold?

28:12.561 --> 28:14.695
I'll see your two...

28:16.397 --> 28:19.732
And raise you five.

28:27.840 --> 28:30.175
Take it.
I was bluffing.

28:30.209 --> 28:31.843
I know.

28:31.877 --> 28:33.111
So was I.

28:33.145 --> 28:34.879
God damn it!

28:34.913 --> 28:36.347
What say we take a break?

28:36.381 --> 28:39.617
Only 14 hours
and you're tired already?

28:39.651 --> 28:41.852
Unfortunate.

28:41.887 --> 28:43.988
Son of a gun.

28:47.793 --> 28:49.661
You wanted to see me?

28:49.695 --> 28:52.797
Yeah, it turns out
my sister-in-law's nephew...

28:52.831 --> 28:55.333
for a time at least...

28:55.367 --> 28:57.468
survived the shooting
in the woods.

28:57.502 --> 29:01.671
Well, I'm sorry
about your loss.

29:02.973 --> 29:05.908
Obviously, if there's
anything I can do...

29:05.943 --> 29:09.480
There is actually.
You can kill someone for me

29:09.514 --> 29:11.549
to settle a debt.

29:11.583 --> 29:13.317
I have it on good authority

29:13.351 --> 29:15.552
that a James Darmody
of Atlantic City

29:15.586 --> 29:18.087
was one of the two shooters.

29:18.121 --> 29:19.588
Who was the other one?

29:19.623 --> 29:21.290
I don't know.

29:21.324 --> 29:23.158
But I'd bet you're
persuasive enough

29:23.193 --> 29:25.227
to get Darmody to tell you.

29:25.261 --> 29:27.428
That's a good bet.

29:27.463 --> 29:30.497
The only kind I make.

29:32.500 --> 29:34.600
You are alone.

29:39.072 --> 29:40.738
Lonely.

29:45.844 --> 29:47.878
But there is a man...

29:47.912 --> 29:50.146
dark.

29:50.180 --> 29:52.448
You know me.
There's always a man.

29:52.482 --> 29:53.716
Oh, this one...

29:53.750 --> 29:55.884
He's not like the others.
He's dangerous.

29:55.918 --> 29:58.586
Mm, do tell.

30:02.624 --> 30:04.958
I'm hearing my future.

30:06.961 --> 30:09.628
I'm very busy, Gillian.

30:11.197 --> 30:12.997
Give us a couple of minutes.

30:17.969 --> 30:19.937
You could have ce
see me, you know.

30:19.971 --> 30:23.839
Request an audience
with the other peasants?

30:23.874 --> 30:26.108
I didn't want
to run into Jimmy.

30:27.344 --> 30:29.178
What can I do for you?

30:29.212 --> 30:31.813
You can honor the agreement
that we made.

30:31.848 --> 30:33.349
He's fine, Gillian.

30:33.383 --> 30:35.818
He's not fine.

30:36.953 --> 30:39.488
I'm his mother.
He's a shell.

30:39.523 --> 30:41.690
I don't know what
you're talking about.

30:41.725 --> 30:43.859
You promised you would
keep him out of trouble.

30:43.893 --> 30:45.594
He's not in trouble.

30:45.629 --> 30:48.931
Do you think I'm blind,
that I don't hear things?

30:48.965 --> 30:51.200
<i>He shows up
out of nowhere</i>

30:51.234 --> 30:53.201
with some $1000 necklace,

30:53.236 --> 30:55.036
which he then
steals back from me.

30:55.070 --> 30:57.004
It's a rough patch, okay?

30:57.039 --> 30:58.773
He just got back.

30:58.807 --> 31:00.742
We take it for granted,
but I'm sure

31:00.776 --> 31:03.311
the entire war was very trying.

31:03.346 --> 31:05.915
He should have stayed
in college.

31:05.949 --> 31:08.851
I advised him to.
He wouldn't listen.

31:08.886 --> 31:10.920
Leading a horse to water
and all that.

31:10.954 --> 31:13.189
He's a grown man who wanted
to serve his country.

31:13.223 --> 31:16.192
Could I have forced him not to?

31:16.226 --> 31:18.761
I was under the impression

31:18.795 --> 31:20.763
that you could do anything.

31:20.797 --> 31:22.898
I'm not God, Gillian.

31:26.369 --> 31:28.270
Now you tell me.

31:46.223 --> 31:48.491
Where the fuck is this place?

31:54.097 --> 31:56.365
The dope was waiting outside.

31:56.400 --> 31:58.567
'Cause youse didn't give me
the right address.

31:58.602 --> 32:00.203
What, is it raining out?

32:00.237 --> 32:01.938
Raining?

32:01.972 --> 32:03.573
I almost drowned, Leo.

32:05.142 --> 32:07.343
He almost drowned.

32:15.720 --> 32:17.421
Thanks for bailing me out.

32:17.455 --> 32:19.223
I gotta protect
my investment, eh?

32:19.257 --> 32:20.991
We would've met you
at the jail,

32:21.025 --> 32:22.526
but we've been getting
the lay of the land.

32:22.560 --> 32:24.094
Fuck the land.

32:24.129 --> 32:26.663
The boardwalk's
where the money's at.

32:26.698 --> 32:28.432
So where're you staying?

32:28.467 --> 32:30.835
Some flophouse on baltic,
off the beach.

32:30.869 --> 32:33.437
Doc says the salt air
helps his respiratory.

32:33.471 --> 32:36.573
That, plus the 15 warrants
waiting back in Philly.

32:36.607 --> 32:38.641
Ain't you got a lawyer, Pius?

32:38.676 --> 32:40.276
<i>I'm Pius,
you stupid pollack.</i>

32:40.310 --> 32:41.944
<i>- The name's Doyle now.
- So?</i>

32:41.978 --> 32:43.845
Go check on the car.

32:49.218 --> 32:50.318
I'm Ignacious.

32:50.352 --> 32:51.953
I thought that was Lucien.

32:51.987 --> 32:53.521
No, Lucien got the birthmark.

32:53.555 --> 32:55.323
You fucking
garlic-eaters.

32:55.357 --> 32:56.758
What, is there like
14 of youse?

32:56.792 --> 32:59.527
Nine, not counting our sisters.

32:59.562 --> 33:00.829
Our pop...

33:00.863 --> 33:02.864
he loves our mother very much.

33:06.534 --> 33:08.802
So this Nucky Thompson, eh?

33:08.836 --> 33:11.404
Gave our entire operation over to the coons.
You believe that?

33:11.439 --> 33:12.873
Our operation?

33:12.907 --> 33:14.475
I loaned you that dough
with Vigorish.

33:14.509 --> 33:17.378
He gets took for a chump and now
we're partners all of a sudden?

33:17.412 --> 33:19.480
I thought you guys were
looking for an opportunity.

33:19.514 --> 33:20.748
We're looking for our money.

33:20.782 --> 33:23.317
How can I pay youse if they
put me out of business?

33:23.351 --> 33:26.187
That's your problem, ain't it?

34:34.687 --> 34:37.088
<i>Marguerite, vite.</i>

34:37.121 --> 34:40.123
We have a very
important customer.

34:40.158 --> 34:42.324
You will take these to her

34:42.360 --> 34:44.360
in the dressing room, eh?

34:44.395 --> 34:46.762
Whatever she needs.

34:50.766 --> 34:52.567
Hello?

34:55.471 --> 34:58.038
Finally.

34:58.073 --> 35:01.074
Are you gonna help me get
out of this thing or what?

35:07.447 --> 35:09.315
You came to see Nucky.

35:09.349 --> 35:12.017
Yes.
I'm Margaret Schroeder.

35:12.051 --> 35:14.452
Bully for you.

35:15.954 --> 35:17.555
When we're done here,

35:17.589 --> 35:20.324
drop my cloak off
with your tailor.

35:20.358 --> 35:24.160
Your boss is having
the lining repaired for me.

35:24.195 --> 35:26.496
Yes, ma'am.

35:40.041 --> 35:43.610
I don't go for
cheap merchandise.

35:43.644 --> 35:45.812
I'll try
the step-in.

35:50.918 --> 35:53.252
The step-in.

35:58.090 --> 35:59.824
That one.

36:00.759 --> 36:02.393
Jesus, sister.

36:02.428 --> 36:04.529
I'm sorry.

36:05.597 --> 36:07.698
Well, you do work here,
don't you?

36:07.733 --> 36:09.133
I do.

36:09.167 --> 36:10.634
So open it up.

36:33.223 --> 36:35.024
Tie it.

36:48.706 --> 36:50.307
Well?

36:50.341 --> 36:53.611
What do you think?

36:53.645 --> 36:56.780
It's very flattering.

36:56.815 --> 37:00.584
You know, I heard Nucky on the
phone getting you this job.

37:00.618 --> 37:03.187
It was very kind of him.

37:03.221 --> 37:05.823
Yeah, well,

37:05.857 --> 37:09.827
he's a soft touch
for the charity cases.

37:19.937 --> 37:22.706
Yes, I'll hold.

37:22.740 --> 37:25.575
They're putting me through.

37:25.609 --> 37:28.478
<i>"The elephant Hotel."</i>

37:28.512 --> 37:30.280
"Dear Lenore,

37:30.314 --> 37:32.349
Douglas had another
attack of dropsy,

37:32.383 --> 37:34.651
so we came down
for his benefit.

37:34.686 --> 37:36.554
The ocean is lovely."

37:36.588 --> 37:38.590
I had an uncle once had dropsy.

37:38.624 --> 37:41.060
You're reading someone's
private correspondence.

37:42.529 --> 37:44.530
<i>Go ahead, please.</i>

37:44.564 --> 37:46.766
Yes, supervisor.
Van Alden here.

37:46.800 --> 37:48.601
<i>Nelson, where are you?</i>

37:48.635 --> 37:50.669
<i>The post
office, Atlantic City.</i>

37:50.704 --> 37:51.871
The post office?

37:51.905 --> 37:54.707
It's the only
federal building in town.

37:54.741 --> 37:56.242
We lost him, sir.

37:56.276 --> 37:58.310
Damn it.
Did he talk?

37:58.345 --> 38:00.312
That's the reason I'm calling.

38:00.347 --> 38:02.048
Sir, I have reason to believe

38:02.082 --> 38:04.984
James Darmody was involved
in the woods massacre.

38:05.019 --> 38:06.719
Darmody.
Why do I know that name?

38:06.753 --> 38:09.322
He's Thompson's lackey, sir.
We tried to recruit him.

38:09.356 --> 38:10.990
Right.
Yes.

38:11.024 --> 38:13.726
<i>Given as how the local sheriff
is Thompson's brother,</i>

38:13.760 --> 38:16.128
the level of cooperation
I'm likely to receive here

38:16.163 --> 38:18.965
necessitates my handling
this arrest myself.

38:18.999 --> 38:20.099
What arrest?

38:20.134 --> 38:21.867
Darmody, sir.
For murder.

38:21.901 --> 38:23.902
Easy, laddy-buck.
You sit tight

38:23.936 --> 38:26.838
till I speak with Bodine
in the U.S. attorney's office.

38:26.872 --> 38:28.507
When will that be, sir?

38:28.541 --> 38:30.376
<i>Get some rest.
Go home and see rose.</i>

38:30.410 --> 38:31.878
I'll call you in a few days.

38:31.912 --> 38:33.045
I' be right here, sir.

38:33.080 --> 38:34.947
<i>Go home, Nelson.
Visit your wife.</i>

38:34.982 --> 38:36.549
<i>That's an order.</i>

38:36.583 --> 38:39.785
And good job.

38:48.862 --> 38:50.864
Jimmy.

38:51.832 --> 38:53.600
Close the door.

38:59.139 --> 39:00.973
Have a seat.

39:06.981 --> 39:08.982
Your pal from the woods...

39:09.016 --> 39:10.483
He's dead.

39:10.517 --> 39:12.151
Good.

39:12.185 --> 39:13.786
That'll keep him quiet.

39:13.820 --> 39:16.689
He already talked.
He fingered you to the feds.

39:16.723 --> 39:18.891
That's impossible.

39:18.925 --> 39:21.427
How would he
even know who I was?

39:21.461 --> 39:23.228
The other one...

39:23.263 --> 39:24.830
Carbone.

39:24.864 --> 39:27.232
<i>Did he call you
by name?</i>

39:36.075 --> 39:40.746
When you were 10 years old,
11 maybe...

39:40.780 --> 39:44.082
I don't know if you'll
even remember this...

39:44.117 --> 39:47.686
President Taft came to town,
some campaign speech.

39:47.720 --> 39:49.955
<i>You were in the crowd.</i>

39:49.989 --> 39:52.024
<i>I suppose you were
with your dad.</i>

39:52.058 --> 39:54.726
But you turned to me and said,

39:54.760 --> 39:58.263
"Nuck, what's a fella gotta
do to become president?"

39:58.297 --> 40:02.267
<i>I said,
"well, you gotta study,</i>

40:02.301 --> 40:05.069
learn everything you can
about the world

40:05.104 --> 40:08.473
and do a lot of
hard work."

40:08.507 --> 40:11.976
And you looked up at me
in disbelief and said,

40:12.011 --> 40:14.012
"gee, is that all?"

40:19.518 --> 40:23.253
I used to think you'd own
the world one day.

40:23.288 --> 40:25.255
You were like that kid

40:25.290 --> 40:28.158
in the alger story...
Raggy Dick.

40:30.695 --> 40:32.996
You did everything right.

40:33.031 --> 40:34.965
And then...

40:41.405 --> 40:44.741
Nuck.

40:44.775 --> 40:46.476
Nuck, I'll do
whatever you want.

40:46.511 --> 40:48.011
What you'll do is leave.

40:48.046 --> 40:49.813
Leave Atlantic City?

40:49.848 --> 40:51.381
You're through here, kid.

40:51.416 --> 40:53.250
Where am I supposed to go?

40:53.284 --> 40:55.886
I hear California's nice.
Maybe Chaplin needs a foil.

40:55.920 --> 40:57.554
I've got a kid to feed, Eli.

40:57.588 --> 40:59.189
And I got eight,

40:59.223 --> 41:01.224
which is why I think
before I go off half-cocked.

41:01.259 --> 41:02.960
What, you're gonna
lecture me now?

41:02.994 --> 41:06.230
If it was up to me, it
wouldn't stop with a lecture.

41:14.839 --> 41:16.439
Take this money,

41:16.474 --> 41:19.509
give it to your wife.

41:22.780 --> 41:25.015
I want you to know, nuck,

41:25.049 --> 41:27.150
I never meant to hurt you.

41:27.185 --> 41:30.454
What are you gonna do, cry,
big war hero?

41:38.329 --> 41:40.597
Good luck, James.

41:55.213 --> 41:58.615
I wonder sometimes...
if it was me,

41:58.650 --> 42:01.284
would you be
half as understanding?

42:11.629 --> 42:13.429
I have a right to know
where you're going.

42:13.464 --> 42:15.599
I told you, I can't
talk about it, okay?

42:15.633 --> 42:17.234
No, it's not okay.

42:17.268 --> 42:19.203
You're a grown man
with a child.

42:19.237 --> 42:21.505
Am I?

42:21.540 --> 42:23.174
What?

42:23.208 --> 42:25.943
Why are you fighting?

42:25.978 --> 42:27.611
We're not fighting, sweetie.

42:27.646 --> 42:30.447
Tommy buddy, go play inside.

42:32.349 --> 42:34.284
So that's it? You're just leaving?

42:34.318 --> 42:36.052
You seemed to be
okay with it last time.

42:36.086 --> 42:37.720
What are you talking about?

42:37.755 --> 42:39.956
What am I talking about?

42:48.866 --> 42:50.700
- What?
- What?

42:50.734 --> 42:52.768
Your shoulders are bare;

42:52.802 --> 42:54.737
<i>that look
on your face.</i>

42:54.771 --> 42:56.905
I thought you'd like it.

42:56.940 --> 42:58.473
I would have.

42:58.508 --> 43:01.009
Plenty of fellas at the front had
pictures of their sweethearts.

43:01.043 --> 43:03.345
How would I have known
where to send it?

43:03.379 --> 43:05.313
Hmm?

43:05.347 --> 43:07.481
Not a letter in almost
two years, Jimmy.

43:07.516 --> 43:09.517
I thought you were dead.

43:09.552 --> 43:12.120
The baby yesterday... We went
down to the boardwalk...

43:12.155 --> 43:14.289
He's awfully friendly
with that photographer.

43:14.323 --> 43:16.491
He's three years old.
He's friendly withv everyone.

43:16.525 --> 43:19.794
Did you fuck him
while I was gone?

43:19.829 --> 43:21.396
Jimmy.

43:21.430 --> 43:24.466
'Cause I will go back there
and I will fucking kill him.

43:24.500 --> 43:26.702
What's wrong with you?

43:26.736 --> 43:29.372
This man, his wife...
They're lovely people.

43:29.406 --> 43:32.508
They befriended me and your
son when we had no one.

43:32.542 --> 43:35.277
There was my mother.

43:39.950 --> 43:43.452
You don't know what it
was like being alone,

43:43.487 --> 43:46.055
not knowing whether
you were dead or alive.

43:46.089 --> 43:48.490
And just as I get used to
living without you,

43:48.525 --> 43:52.094
you show up out of nowhere.

43:52.128 --> 43:53.695
What did you expect?

43:53.730 --> 43:56.898
I don't know!

43:56.932 --> 43:59.066
For things to be normal.

44:06.208 --> 44:10.811
Things were barely normal
before you left, Jimmy.

44:13.348 --> 44:16.316
We hardly even knew each other.

44:19.754 --> 44:22.456
Well, you know me
a lot better now.

44:34.670 --> 44:37.572
Make sure them labels
are on straight,

44:37.607 --> 44:40.776
no glue running off the sides.

44:45.282 --> 44:47.484
Bring the packard around.

44:51.022 --> 44:53.090
Let me get one of them.

45:05.501 --> 45:07.636
The roast tastes good.

46:21.769 --> 46:25.071
This boy's not 20 years old.

46:28.243 --> 46:30.878
It's a tragedy, Chalky.

46:32.514 --> 46:34.982
Is that what it is?

46:35.016 --> 46:39.252
This goes no further than
here, you understand me?

46:39.287 --> 46:41.988
You talk to these people.

46:44.658 --> 46:46.993
It's an election year, Chalky.

46:47.027 --> 46:49.362
The last thing we need
is a race war.

46:52.733 --> 46:56.236
Do you understand me?

46:59.340 --> 47:02.142
For the time being.

47:04.045 --> 47:05.979
What happened is

47:06.013 --> 47:09.082
this man was cheating
with another fella's wife.

47:09.116 --> 47:11.117
And the fella shot him.

47:11.152 --> 47:15.422
That's what
it looks like to me.

47:20.294 --> 47:23.763
50%.

47:49.055 --> 47:51.790
<i>Mutti! Mutti!</i>

47:54.394 --> 47:56.629
<i>Ich habe hunger, mama.</i>

48:44.709 --> 48:47.644
Broadway limited
going to Chicago, Illinois.

48:47.678 --> 48:51.347
Broadway limited going
to Chicago, Illinois.
