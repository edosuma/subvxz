WEBVTT

00:35.744 --> 00:38.789
[maitre d'] Caspers, sorry for the wait.
I'm  so sorry.

00:38.872 --> 00:42.334
If you follow me. I have a great table
ready for you. You're right this way.

00:46.296 --> 00:48.924
I will come back
and check on you shortly, okay?

00:49.341 --> 00:50.175
Thanks, guys.

00:52.344 --> 00:53.679
Hi, how are you?

00:55.013 --> 00:56.473
Oh, hi! [chuckles]

00:58.100 --> 00:58.934
[Tony Sr. speaking]

00:59.017 --> 01:01.270
I can't believe that you could live here
your whole life...

01:01.687 --> 01:03.855
-and not see this place--
-I've heard of it.

01:03.939 --> 01:05.816
You've heard of it?
Of course you've heard of it.

01:05.899 --> 01:07.901
It's Romanelli's. It's an institution.

01:08.652 --> 01:10.779
You know, back in the day,
you'd see famous politicians

01:10.862 --> 01:12.489
and mobsters here all the time.

01:12.573 --> 01:15.033
It was like a game trying to tell
one from the other.

01:16.410 --> 01:17.619
You see that table over there?

01:17.953 --> 01:19.246
That was Sinatra's table.

01:19.496 --> 01:20.330
Yeah...

01:21.039 --> 01:22.791
You see the microphone behind it?

01:22.874 --> 01:23.917
-See that?
-Yeah.

01:24.001 --> 01:28.505
That's the actual microphone he used
at the Copacabana in 1953.

01:28.589 --> 01:29.840
Did you ever see him here?

01:29.923 --> 01:33.260
Sure, I saw him all the time.
And everytime I saw him,

01:33.343 --> 01:34.886
he was with a different broad. [laughs]

01:35.345 --> 01:36.179
"Broad."

01:36.805 --> 01:40.434
I know, that sounds disrespectful,
but these were broads. [laughs]

01:41.101 --> 01:43.937
And he always ordered the veal scallopini,
he loved it.

01:44.229 --> 01:47.608
He said it was
the world's greatest aphrodisiac.

01:47.983 --> 01:49.484
-[woman] Mmm!
-[Tony Sr. laughs]

01:49.610 --> 01:51.486
I don't know, everything looks so good.

01:51.612 --> 01:54.990
-Well, may I suggest the veal scallopini?
-[both laugh]

01:55.157 --> 01:56.366
Why am I not surprised?

01:56.450 --> 01:58.619
You want me to put on
a Ava Gardner wig later?

01:58.869 --> 01:59.703
No.

02:00.203 --> 02:02.039
-You have one?
-[both chuckle]

02:05.042 --> 02:07.085
I guess it's not Frank's table anymore.

02:07.753 --> 02:10.005
Yeah, now it's hedge fund managers and...

02:10.547 --> 02:12.716
bankers and masters of the universe.

02:13.050 --> 02:14.676
See the guy with the bowtie?

02:15.594 --> 02:16.720
Chairman of Citibank.

02:17.012 --> 02:19.139
He's worth about a half a billion dollars.

02:19.389 --> 02:20.515
-Wow.
-Let me tell you,

02:20.599 --> 02:22.225
he's the poorest guy at the table.

02:22.351 --> 02:24.102
Everybody else feels sorry for him.

02:24.227 --> 02:26.772
They're probably gonna get him
the kiddie dinner. [laughs]

02:26.855 --> 02:27.981
What are you, jealous?

02:28.231 --> 02:30.817
What, jealous of them?
What are you kidding me?

02:31.068 --> 02:34.571
Look who I'm sitting with.
They're jealous of me. [chuckles]

02:40.744 --> 02:42.704
Joy, whatever you do...

02:43.330 --> 02:45.582
don't make a sound, don't scream,
don't stand up.

02:45.666 --> 02:47.209
Just try to stay close to me.

02:47.292 --> 02:50.212
[thief shouting] Everybody,
this is robbery! No one move!

02:50.295 --> 02:52.130
You put your jewelry, wallet,

02:52.214 --> 02:53.382
in satchel!

02:53.590 --> 02:55.592
[people murmuring]

02:56.093 --> 02:57.719
-[man] Come on.
-[thief] Come on!

03:02.599 --> 03:03.433
Come on.

03:09.940 --> 03:12.609
No! Please! [lady sobs]

03:13.360 --> 03:15.237
Please don't! [whimpers]

03:15.487 --> 03:17.114
[lady cries]

03:21.076 --> 03:22.661
Alright. Easy!

03:22.994 --> 03:24.663
Easy. Take it easy, boys!

03:24.746 --> 03:27.416
You can have all the money...
all the money.

03:27.958 --> 03:28.792
Alright.

03:29.292 --> 03:31.545
Hey, Daddy Warbucks! Give it up.

03:31.920 --> 03:34.172
They'll send you
a new platinum card tomorrow.

03:34.297 --> 03:35.173
Listen everybody!

03:35.674 --> 03:36.967
Just do what they say!

03:37.467 --> 03:38.969
These men are professionals.

03:39.511 --> 03:41.346
They just want to get out of here,
am I right?

03:41.430 --> 03:43.265
Yeah. That's right!

03:45.684 --> 03:47.060
What are you looking at?

03:47.352 --> 03:48.186
Nothing.

03:48.311 --> 03:50.272
No, not him, the other one!

03:53.191 --> 03:54.401
You have a problem?

03:56.153 --> 03:57.821
Back there. Go!

04:05.620 --> 04:07.622
-[gunshot]
-[everybody gasps]

04:08.415 --> 04:09.332
[thief] Come on!

04:09.750 --> 04:11.752
[women crying]

04:11.835 --> 04:13.712
[people murmuring]

04:14.337 --> 04:16.339
-[police siren]
-[policemen chattering]

04:30.228 --> 04:32.022
[door creaks and closes]

04:32.105 --> 04:34.483
[waiter] Good to see you, sir.
Right over there.

04:36.026 --> 04:37.027
[TJ] Lulu, Rodrigo.

04:37.694 --> 04:38.528
I'm so sorry.

04:38.695 --> 04:40.030
-Are you okay?
-We're fine.

04:40.447 --> 04:43.950
-Jocelyn?
-I think I'm okay. I could use a drink.

04:44.326 --> 04:45.494
You know where the bar is.

04:45.952 --> 04:46.912
Caruso.

04:48.580 --> 04:49.414
Welcome to Hell.

04:49.831 --> 04:52.959
-Dispatcher says it was a male victim?
-Yeah, in the kitchen, he's a busboy.

04:53.043 --> 04:54.127
Just turned 19.

04:54.544 --> 04:55.378
Busboy?

04:56.004 --> 04:58.840
Yeah, lucky your father was here,
could have been worse.

04:59.466 --> 05:01.885
That's something I don't here everyday.
Or ever.

05:02.302 --> 05:05.096
-Where is he?
-He's in the corner, talking to the owner.

05:05.972 --> 05:08.141
Check this out. It's all from your Dad.

05:08.225 --> 05:12.479
Detailed description of both perps.
We got weapons, scars, tattoos.

05:12.771 --> 05:15.899
-It's the best eyewitness we've ever had.
-Doesn't surprise me.

05:15.982 --> 05:19.486
He's been to thousands of crime scenes.
Of course, half the time he's fleeing.

05:19.986 --> 05:21.071
So how'd it go down?

05:21.404 --> 05:24.491
Two perps. Maybe Russian, maybe Turkish,
your Dad's not sure.

05:24.574 --> 05:27.494
7:40. They come in heavy, guns out,
"Nobody move."

05:27.702 --> 05:30.247
Then they go around collecting
wallets and jewelry.

05:30.831 --> 05:33.792
-They didn't hit the register?
-Never touched it.

05:35.418 --> 05:37.337
What happened to the busboy, he resist?

05:37.420 --> 05:39.339
We're still piecing that together,
he's back here.

05:39.422 --> 05:40.257
[Tony Sr.] Son.

05:41.174 --> 05:43.468
-Are you okay?
-Yeah. I'm good.

05:43.552 --> 05:45.804
-Where's Joy?
-She's good too. I sent her home...

05:45.887 --> 05:49.307
but I'm glad you're here, cause...
I just got a really exciting lead.

05:49.391 --> 05:50.308
On the shooters?

05:50.725 --> 05:53.186
The shooters? No, that's your problem.

05:53.687 --> 05:56.481
No. I was talking to Angelo.
He wants to sell the joint.

05:57.691 --> 06:00.402
-What joint?
-What joint? This joint. Romanelli's.

06:00.610 --> 06:02.529
His wife is making him leave the city.

06:02.612 --> 06:05.282
-She thinks it too dangerous.
-[Cora] Can't imagine why?

06:05.532 --> 06:09.077
Hey. He owes me a solid.
He's practically giving it away.

06:09.452 --> 06:11.413
-He's asking 1.4.
-Million?

06:11.496 --> 06:13.248
Yeah, obviously I'm gonna need a loan.

06:13.331 --> 06:15.458
You know, cause I'm about 1.5
shy of that number,

06:15.542 --> 06:17.127
but isn't this perfect?

06:17.294 --> 06:20.714
Romanelli's, our place.
Now it could really be our place.

06:20.797 --> 06:21.756
We'll run it together.

06:24.634 --> 06:26.803
Whoa! We?

06:26.887 --> 06:29.222
Yeah, well no bank's gonna ever
loan me that kind of money.

06:29.306 --> 06:30.265
-Yeah.
-I need a partner.

06:30.640 --> 06:32.517
A partner like you. Hero cop,

06:32.601 --> 06:33.727
-squeaky clean...
-Sure.

06:33.810 --> 06:34.728
...with perfect credit.

06:34.811 --> 06:37.814
I hope you're enjoying this conversation,
because it's over.

06:39.149 --> 06:40.734
Best location in Manhattan.

06:41.192 --> 06:43.194
[policemen chattering]

06:43.987 --> 06:44.821
[Cora] Thank you.

06:46.197 --> 06:47.574
Hey guys, give us the room?

06:48.074 --> 06:49.200
-Yeah.
-Thanks.

06:54.289 --> 06:55.415
There's an exit wound.

06:56.499 --> 06:58.084
Laceration on the right ear.

06:59.377 --> 07:00.712
Scuff marks on his knees.

07:01.713 --> 07:02.547
He was executed.

07:04.132 --> 07:06.217
-Is that his wallet?
-Affirmative.

07:06.343 --> 07:08.678
There was some cash in it,
but they didn't take it.

07:08.929 --> 07:11.139
So, what do you think?

07:11.222 --> 07:12.933
Dad, you're contaminating
my crime scene.

07:13.016 --> 07:15.852
-You're contaminating my kitchen--
-Will you please just stand over there?

07:16.186 --> 07:17.020
Thank you.

07:18.563 --> 07:20.774
-[huffs] Did you find the shell?
-Not yet.

07:21.358 --> 07:23.193
You might want to look under the cabinet.

07:23.318 --> 07:25.236
I saw the guy,
It was a Maklova automatic,

07:25.320 --> 07:26.529
they eject to the left.

07:35.538 --> 07:37.123
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

07:37.207 --> 07:39.209
Hey son, brand new steam table.

07:39.292 --> 07:42.128
-Thirty grand at least--
-No, I'm not cosigning on a loan.

07:42.212 --> 07:44.798
I'm not going to be your partner.
That door's closed. I mean it.

07:45.465 --> 07:46.299
Okay.

07:46.466 --> 07:49.386
Okay. I'm leaving. I'm leaving, but...

07:49.928 --> 07:52.555
it's in your head.
The seed has been planted.

07:52.639 --> 07:55.016
There's no seed. Nothing's been planted.

07:55.141 --> 07:59.604
Yeah, it's planted. It's in there.
Caruso boys, partners, working together.

07:59.729 --> 08:01.272
-Father and son.
-Out. That's enough.

08:01.356 --> 08:02.190
Come on.

08:02.315 --> 08:03.566
Okay, okay, but...

08:03.733 --> 08:06.069
make sure you check out
that walk-in freezer.

08:06.152 --> 08:07.362
Whoo-hoo, Is it great?

08:10.407 --> 08:11.616
Congratulations.

08:12.409 --> 08:13.243
On what?

08:13.451 --> 08:14.536
Your new restaurant.

08:15.620 --> 08:17.497
What, you think
he's going to wear me down?

08:17.622 --> 08:19.499
You think I can't say no to him? [laughs]

08:19.582 --> 08:22.585
That is very insulting, Cora.
I've got to tell you, I'm hurt.

08:22.669 --> 08:24.295
Are you gonna change the menu?

08:25.380 --> 08:26.214
Cora.

08:27.674 --> 08:28.508
No smiling.

08:29.134 --> 08:31.886
I outrank you, remember that.
That's a direct order. No smiling.

08:46.776 --> 08:49.612
-[cameras flash and click]
-TJ, smile.

08:50.196 --> 08:52.240
-[chuckles]
-[music playing]

08:52.574 --> 08:54.993
Yeah. That's good.
Come on, have a good time.

08:55.076 --> 08:56.453
Come on, here we go!

08:56.828 --> 08:57.704
What do you say--

08:58.246 --> 08:59.289
Tony.

08:59.372 --> 09:01.041
-Look who it is.
-Congratulations.

09:01.124 --> 09:02.709
-Thank you.
-How do you feel?

09:02.792 --> 09:04.919
How do I feel?
Almost as good as you look.

09:05.003 --> 09:07.547
-[both chuckle]
-Enjoy, okay?

09:08.048 --> 09:09.507
Hey... your Honor.

09:10.133 --> 09:13.261
So nice to see you, sir.
How nice of you to be with us tonight.

09:13.386 --> 09:14.304
Wait a minute, come on.

09:14.387 --> 09:18.725
You could afford better wine than this.
This is what honest judges drink. [laughs]

09:19.684 --> 09:22.937
Hey, Pauly. What do you say, Paul?
How are you? You look good.

09:23.021 --> 09:25.356
You lost some weight? We can fix that.
[laughs]

09:25.732 --> 09:28.234
Hey, Tony! The risotto is delicous.

09:28.318 --> 09:29.694
Frankie, thank you very much.

09:29.819 --> 09:32.447
You know, that's my grandmother's recipe
and she's in heaven,

09:32.530 --> 09:34.282
so you're never going to get
to tell her that.

09:34.407 --> 09:36.701
-[everybody laughs]
-I'll see you.

09:37.619 --> 09:40.163
-It's the happiest I've ever seen him.
-I know.

09:41.247 --> 09:43.041
I've never been more frightened
in my life.

09:44.793 --> 09:46.461
It's the best table in the house.

09:47.045 --> 09:48.630
It was Frank Sinatra's table.

09:50.799 --> 09:52.717
-There you go.
-[man] Thank you very much.

09:52.801 --> 09:53.635
Enjoy.

09:55.261 --> 09:56.763
Let me know if you need anything.

09:57.764 --> 10:00.934
Other restaurants call me...
begging, "Tony, please...

10:01.059 --> 10:04.229
don't serve your Bolognese,
it's too delicious. It's not fair."

10:04.312 --> 10:05.772
[everybody laughing]

10:05.855 --> 10:07.357
-May I speak with you?
-Yeah.

10:07.440 --> 10:10.193
Excuse me, I have to confer
a moment with my partner.

10:11.486 --> 10:12.570
Hey, one second.

10:16.783 --> 10:18.034
Tell Holly, more lemon.

10:20.078 --> 10:21.579
Partner, I've got to tell you.

10:21.663 --> 10:24.499
-I love saying that.
-Did you take the tax off this bill?

10:25.166 --> 10:27.961
Let me see that.
That's alright, don't worry about it.

10:28.044 --> 10:30.046
Uncle Sam can do without his nine percent.

10:30.171 --> 10:32.799
As a matter of fact, Uncle Sam cares a lot
about his nine percent.

10:32.882 --> 10:34.175
It was Wendell Kirk.

10:34.259 --> 10:37.554
Wendell gave you your first haircut.
I can't charge him full freight.

10:37.679 --> 10:38.721
It's an infraction.

10:38.805 --> 10:42.642
[sighs] Son, it's opening night.
Everything's legal on opening night.

10:43.059 --> 10:44.894
Give that finger of yours a rest.

10:45.186 --> 10:47.605
Stuffed artichokes,
let me tell you about them.

11:01.995 --> 11:04.831
[Cora] Guess what just turned up?
The satchel.

11:05.623 --> 11:08.543
-[TJ] The satchel?
-From the restaurant. From the night of.

11:08.626 --> 11:12.172
[Cora] Sanitation found it, stuffed behind
a dumpster on Vinton Street.

11:12.505 --> 11:13.882
Get this? It's all there.

11:14.257 --> 11:15.717
The credit cards, the cash...

11:15.842 --> 11:17.177
The jewely's still MIA,

11:17.260 --> 11:19.387
but nothing's been pawned or sold.

11:20.305 --> 11:22.807
I can't figure it,
what kind of robbery was this?

11:26.895 --> 11:28.855
I'm sorry.
I thought I was at a police station.

11:28.980 --> 11:32.108
Everyone's wearing badges.
That's what confused me.

11:33.276 --> 11:34.152
What is that?

11:35.945 --> 11:37.864
A citation from the Health Department.

11:38.406 --> 11:39.282
A citation.

11:40.617 --> 11:41.451
A citation.

11:41.534 --> 11:42.493
Is it a citation?

11:42.577 --> 11:43.828
Yes, it's a citation.

11:45.288 --> 11:46.414
When I was in high school,

11:46.497 --> 11:48.082
I knew what I wanted to be
when I grew up.

11:48.333 --> 11:49.876
I wanted to be not my father.

11:50.251 --> 11:52.045
That was my goal.
I dedicated my life to it.

11:52.503 --> 11:54.547
-And you did it.
-I did it. Yes.

11:54.964 --> 11:57.759
My father was over here, lying,
and cheating, and doing god-knows-what,

11:57.884 --> 12:00.303
and I was over here in my world,
being not him.

12:00.470 --> 12:01.304
Now...

12:01.512 --> 12:05.516
I'm getting certified mail, and warnings,
and citations mailed to the two of us.

12:06.851 --> 12:07.810
I'm in it with him.

12:08.311 --> 12:09.312
We're in the swamp.

12:09.604 --> 12:10.480
Together.

12:10.563 --> 12:11.981
You're swamp mates.

12:12.398 --> 12:13.650
We're swamp mates.

12:14.859 --> 12:15.902
How did this happen?

12:16.694 --> 12:18.696
[Ryan knocking on window]

12:20.073 --> 12:23.159
A customer who was in the restaurant
just sent me an MP3 file.

12:23.243 --> 12:25.578
She was on the phone
when the bus boy got shot.

12:25.662 --> 12:27.956
The whole thing is recorded
on her sister's voicemail.

12:28.373 --> 12:30.375
[speaking Lithouanian]

12:31.125 --> 12:31.960
Is that Russian?

12:32.168 --> 12:35.255
It's actually Lithuanian.
It's from a country called...

12:35.964 --> 12:37.173
Lithuania.

12:37.423 --> 12:39.926
It took me awhile to translate.
I wrote it down...

12:40.218 --> 12:41.594
It's here somewhere.

12:41.678 --> 12:43.680
[phone ringing]

12:45.348 --> 12:46.182
Alvin.

12:46.474 --> 12:47.308
Hey.

12:47.475 --> 12:49.394
-Nothing much. Did you get them?
-Ryan.

12:49.519 --> 12:50.645
For the whole weekend?

12:51.354 --> 12:52.188
It's Comic Con.

12:52.730 --> 12:53.564
Great.

12:54.107 --> 12:55.358
What about Sunday?

12:56.276 --> 12:57.944
-That's the Deadpool panel.
-Ryan.

12:58.069 --> 12:59.904
-That's the whole reason we're going.
-Okay.

13:00.029 --> 13:01.239
Alright. You know what?

13:02.949 --> 13:03.783
Alvi.

13:03.908 --> 13:04.742
Hey.

13:04.826 --> 13:05.660
I have to go.

13:05.743 --> 13:07.745
My phone is in my boss's pants.

13:07.954 --> 13:08.997
Call me later.

13:10.290 --> 13:12.458
-Not cool, man.
-The two guys at the restaurant.

13:12.542 --> 13:14.585
-What were they saying?
-Here it is.

13:17.714 --> 13:19.507
"No, not him, the other one."

13:19.799 --> 13:21.759
[policemen chattering]

13:22.635 --> 13:23.469
Other one?

13:23.636 --> 13:25.346
[Tony Sr.] "No, not him, the other one."

13:25.513 --> 13:28.599
Wait, what are you talking about?
You saying it wasn't random?

13:28.683 --> 13:30.351
[TJ] We think they were after the busboy.

13:30.435 --> 13:32.520
The rest of it, the robbery,
was just a diversion.

13:32.979 --> 13:35.857
-They were after the busboy?
-[Cora] It would explain his wallet.

13:36.232 --> 13:39.360
They opened it, but didn't take anything.
Maybe they were checking his ID?

13:39.444 --> 13:42.113
Why, was he in trouble?
Did he owe money?

13:42.322 --> 13:43.156
No.

13:43.489 --> 13:44.324
Was he dealing?

13:44.407 --> 13:46.534
No, he was a good kid.
No enemies, no priors.

13:46.617 --> 13:48.578
He was working his way
through Divinity School.

13:48.786 --> 13:51.873
Yeah, he was an Eagle Scout.
He had more merit badges than TJ.

13:52.415 --> 13:53.416
He started young.

13:53.499 --> 13:55.960
-Actually, he started when he was 11.
-When was his birthday?

13:57.128 --> 14:00.673
You know what?<i></i>It doesn't matter.
Not a contest. We can't find the motive.

14:00.923 --> 14:01.841
That's the bottom line.

14:01.924 --> 14:05.136
He might have been afraid of something.
On the morning he was killed,

14:05.219 --> 14:07.347
he bought a plane ticket back to Bogota.

14:07.972 --> 14:10.725
Let me ask around here.
Maybe somebody knows something.

14:10.933 --> 14:12.894
Actually, Dad, while I have you.

14:14.312 --> 14:17.607
This is from the Health Department.
[sighs] This is a citation.

14:17.899 --> 14:20.485
Yeah, but it's a blue citation.
It's just a warning.

14:20.568 --> 14:21.652
It's nothing, you know?

14:21.736 --> 14:24.155
It's like a parking ticket,
you just ignore it.

14:24.280 --> 14:25.114
Excuse me?

14:25.198 --> 14:27.617
Restaurants get thousands
of these every year, you know?

14:27.700 --> 14:29.952
You wouldn't understand
because you're not in the business.

14:30.912 --> 14:33.122
I am in the business,
we're partners, remember?

14:33.289 --> 14:35.500
Excuse me, I'll be back.

14:39.170 --> 14:42.048
Maybe, I can stop off, on my way home
and buy you a spine?

14:42.298 --> 14:43.257
What are you, 5'10?

14:44.842 --> 14:46.719
Minestrone! How do they prepare that?

14:48.721 --> 14:49.555
I'm 5'11.

14:51.974 --> 14:52.809
Sure.

14:54.102 --> 14:56.396
-[people laughing]
-[Tony Sr.] How are you? Good to see you.

15:00.858 --> 15:01.859
Who are these guys?

15:02.652 --> 15:05.988
Board of directors, Deutsche Bank,
they're waiting for table seven.

15:06.739 --> 15:07.949
The heavy hitters.

15:08.241 --> 15:09.909
They all want Sinatra's table.

15:12.161 --> 15:13.037
Right there.

15:13.371 --> 15:14.205
Yeah.

15:15.039 --> 15:16.958
Got to make sure you get every crumb.

15:21.671 --> 15:23.047
[Burl] This your first restaurant?

15:23.589 --> 15:24.424
No.

15:25.299 --> 15:26.926
Is this your first table cloth?

15:27.552 --> 15:28.845
I think it is. Yeah.

15:31.681 --> 15:33.558
I have an idea about the case,
is that okay?

15:34.517 --> 15:36.227
Of course, could use all the help
we can get.

15:36.686 --> 15:39.105
This whole time,
we've been looking for a motive...

15:39.397 --> 15:42.775
but what if there wasn't a motive?
What if it was a mistake?

15:43.484 --> 15:45.486
Have you guys seen the first <i>Terminator?</i>

15:45.653 --> 15:46.988
<i>Terminator </i>1.

15:47.530 --> 15:49.740
Arnold Schwarzenegger
comes from the future

15:49.824 --> 15:52.118
to kill a lady named Sarah Connor.

15:52.493 --> 15:55.746
But all he knows is her name.
He doesn't know what she looks like,

15:55.830 --> 15:58.791
so he starts killing a bunch of ladies
named Sarah Connor.

16:00.168 --> 16:01.502
So, what are you saying?

16:02.378 --> 16:04.589
What if the Lithuanian dude

16:04.839 --> 16:07.550
were sent to kill Porfirio Santini,

16:07.717 --> 16:10.803
but they killed
the wrong Porfirio Santini.

16:11.012 --> 16:13.598
And maybe, just maybe, the real...

16:13.848 --> 16:17.310
Porfirio Santini is still out there.

16:17.477 --> 16:20.563
And the Lithuanian dudes
are going to realize their mistake...

16:20.730 --> 16:22.148
and kill him too.

16:22.773 --> 16:24.775
-[people chattering]
-[music playing]

16:26.152 --> 16:29.071
Let's stop and see if we can
come up with a stupider idea.

16:37.747 --> 16:38.581
Anybody?

16:42.335 --> 16:44.837
[man] Hey, Porfirio,
some guys are looking for you.

16:45.004 --> 16:45.838
What guys?

16:45.922 --> 16:47.965
Some foreign guys, maybe Russian?

16:48.174 --> 16:49.091
They're out front.

16:51.344 --> 16:52.178
Hey, you okay?

16:55.097 --> 16:55.932
This is it.

16:56.432 --> 16:58.851
They found me. They finally found me.

16:59.185 --> 17:00.394
Man, what'd you do?

17:02.021 --> 17:04.398
I know too much. I've seen too much.

17:08.694 --> 17:09.529
Porfirio!

17:15.993 --> 17:17.537
[gunshot]

17:18.287 --> 17:20.289
[policemen chattering]

17:23.918 --> 17:25.920
[phone ringing]

17:30.675 --> 17:32.677
[door knocking]

17:34.470 --> 17:36.013
All points bulletin. [sighs]

17:36.514 --> 17:38.432
Assault with a deadly, attempted homicide.

17:38.516 --> 17:39.725
Read the victim's name.

17:40.893 --> 17:43.271
Porfirio Santini. Jesus, Mary and Joseph.

17:43.437 --> 17:46.023
So I was right. He had the same name.

17:46.190 --> 17:47.525
They killed the wrong guy.

17:47.775 --> 17:48.609
Looks like it.

17:48.818 --> 17:50.528
So I solved the case.

17:51.946 --> 17:52.780
It's possible.

17:53.823 --> 17:54.782
Could I get a gun?

17:54.865 --> 17:56.617
[everybody] No.

17:56.701 --> 17:58.160
-Not in this lifetime.
-No.

17:58.244 --> 18:00.830
If he's issued a gun,
we'd have to evacuate the whole city.

18:00.955 --> 18:02.248
The second Mr. Santini,

18:02.331 --> 18:03.958
that is the real Mr. Santini,

18:04.041 --> 18:05.167
is at St. Barnabas.

18:05.459 --> 18:07.962
He's out of surgery, serious, but stable,
we can see him tomorrow.

18:08.045 --> 18:09.005
You want to talk to him?

18:09.130 --> 18:11.257
You better take it,
I have to be back at the restaurant.

18:11.340 --> 18:13.259
-Is there a problem?
-[TJ] My father was right.

18:13.718 --> 18:16.429
The citation we got last week
was just a warning, wasn't serious.

18:22.727 --> 18:24.228
These are serious. [sighs]

18:26.480 --> 18:27.857
[Burl clears throat]

18:28.441 --> 18:31.110
The magnificent David Gardner
would sit right there,

18:31.402 --> 18:34.113
and this seat was reserved
for the "Chairman of the Board".

18:34.196 --> 18:35.364
[Man] Of what company?

18:35.656 --> 18:38.451
No, that's what they called Mr. Sinatra.

18:38.576 --> 18:39.910
The chairman of the board.

18:40.077 --> 18:43.205
Well, that's what they call me too.
Except, I'm the real thing.

18:43.289 --> 18:44.498
Good thing Frank's not around,

18:44.582 --> 18:46.500
he might straighten you out
on that one.

18:46.584 --> 18:48.586
[everybody laughing]

18:49.378 --> 18:50.296
Yeah, okay.

18:50.379 --> 18:52.381
Alright guys,
excuse me a second. Enjoy.

18:53.758 --> 18:54.592
Cheers.

18:54.925 --> 18:57.094
-[forks and knives clinking]
-[gas whooshes]

19:04.268 --> 19:05.227
What are you doing?

19:06.354 --> 19:09.023
[TJ sighs] Food needs to be
six inches off the ground.

19:09.357 --> 19:10.441
That's an infraction.

19:11.776 --> 19:14.403
You can't store eggs next to a salad.
Infraction.

19:14.487 --> 19:16.155
The sink's clogged. Infraction.

19:17.531 --> 19:19.075
Unwashed contact surface.

19:19.450 --> 19:20.284
Infraction.

19:20.368 --> 19:23.621
-Dirty towels, trash cans in the kitchen.
-Where are you getting all this?

19:23.704 --> 19:25.539
The Health Department,
you might've heard of it.

19:25.790 --> 19:27.291
I've read this entire binder.

19:28.542 --> 19:31.045
Doesn't look so bad,
you only circled a couple of things.

19:31.629 --> 19:33.506
Those are the rules
we haven't broken, Dad.

19:34.507 --> 19:35.966
What the hell is that?

19:36.676 --> 19:39.387
I brought that in.
It's a practice dummy for the staff.

19:39.470 --> 19:40.554
In case somebody's choking.

19:40.680 --> 19:42.390
I should have asked him
to partner with me.

19:42.515 --> 19:44.809
He never would have agreed.
He's got too much sense.

19:47.061 --> 19:49.522
-Is he smoking?
-That's okay, he's not a customer.

19:49.980 --> 19:50.981
He's the chef.

19:51.357 --> 19:53.693
That's worse.
He's preparing the food, Dad.

19:53.776 --> 19:54.944
That is worse.

19:55.027 --> 19:58.072
Holly makes the best stuffed artichoke
in the city. He's an artist.

19:58.155 --> 19:59.699
People drive down from Boston.

19:59.782 --> 20:01.909
If he wants to smoke,
we're gonna let him smoke.

20:02.410 --> 20:04.412
-[plates clinking]
-[staff chattering]

20:05.830 --> 20:07.498
Holly, you're going to have
to put that out.

20:10.543 --> 20:13.379
-How come nobody listens to me?
-Maybe it's the hair net.

20:14.547 --> 20:16.799
Aren't you worried?
What if the health inspector comes?

20:16.882 --> 20:19.135
-They'll shut this place down.
-Nobody's getting shut down.

20:19.218 --> 20:21.470
I know the health inspector,
Desmond Farrelli.

20:21.554 --> 20:22.805
We have a relationship.

20:23.389 --> 20:24.765
What kind of relationship?

20:24.974 --> 20:26.600
A very warm relationship.

20:27.727 --> 20:29.687
Are you bribing the health inspector, Dad?

20:29.895 --> 20:31.355
Welcome to the big city.

20:32.273 --> 20:33.357
Hang on a second.

20:33.983 --> 20:35.484
Speak of the Devil.

20:35.776 --> 20:37.570
Hey, Des. What's happening?

20:37.778 --> 20:39.947
Were your ears burning?
We were just talking about--

20:40.406 --> 20:41.240
What?

20:42.533 --> 20:43.367
When?

20:45.202 --> 20:47.872
Yeah, I understand.
Thanks for the heads up.

20:48.581 --> 20:49.457
What did you do?

20:50.166 --> 20:51.000
What?

20:51.125 --> 20:53.085
That's my guy. He's been reassigned.

20:53.169 --> 20:56.172
They're sending another inspector
down here. What did you do?

20:56.422 --> 20:57.882
I emailed the supervisor.

20:58.048 --> 21:00.384
-What supervisor?
-At the Health Department.

21:00.509 --> 21:02.094
-Why?
-To get an extension,

21:02.178 --> 21:04.388
-to bring our kitchen up to code.
-Are you mental?

21:05.014 --> 21:07.308
I mean, you put us on their radar.

21:07.391 --> 21:08.726
We're on their radar.

21:08.809 --> 21:10.936
They're going to hire
a real grown-up inspector,

21:11.020 --> 21:12.563
who will come down here
and shut us down!

21:12.646 --> 21:15.065
Not necessarily, you know,
we could just fix everything.

21:15.149 --> 21:16.442
It can't be done, Anthony!

21:16.525 --> 21:17.359
Look at this!

21:17.651 --> 21:19.278
There's like 200 pages here.

21:19.487 --> 21:21.614
There must be a thousand regulations.

21:21.781 --> 21:22.990
It can't be done!

21:23.073 --> 21:25.868
Here. Look, you see?

21:26.076 --> 21:29.413
Am I crazy? Here, you talk to him,
because I give up.

21:29.622 --> 21:31.373
And please, lose the hair net.

21:32.958 --> 21:35.377
-If I do, it's an infraction.
-[Tony Sr. groans]

21:38.839 --> 21:40.841
[cardiograph beeps]

21:42.259 --> 21:45.429
Mr. Santini, I'm Detective Vasquez,
All-City Homicide.

21:45.513 --> 21:46.639
[Santini pants]

21:46.722 --> 21:47.556
How you feeling?

21:49.350 --> 21:50.434
I, ID.

21:51.310 --> 21:52.645
ID? Yes, of course.

21:58.484 --> 22:00.069
I just have a couple of questions.

22:00.152 --> 22:02.363
The men who shot you,
do know who they were?

22:02.822 --> 22:03.656
Don't ask.

22:04.406 --> 22:06.116
Sir, I have to ask, that's my job.

22:06.784 --> 22:07.701
It doesn't matter.

22:08.494 --> 22:09.411
I'm a dead man.

22:09.703 --> 22:12.164
-That's not true, we can protect you.
-Who?

22:12.706 --> 22:14.708
You? You and that guppy out there?

22:14.917 --> 22:16.627
[Santini whimpers]

22:16.752 --> 22:18.587
No, they'll find me.

22:19.547 --> 22:20.548
They'll never stop.

22:21.632 --> 22:22.466
I know too much.

22:22.925 --> 22:24.468
[cardiograph beeping faster]

22:24.593 --> 22:25.719
About what, what do you know?

22:25.886 --> 22:27.888
[groans]

22:28.681 --> 22:30.683
If you don't help us we can't help you.

22:32.184 --> 22:33.269
I can tell you this.

22:34.728 --> 22:36.438
Whatever you thinking right now...

22:36.522 --> 22:38.899
and whatever you imagine
that this is about...

22:38.983 --> 22:40.818
[takes a deep breath]
...you're wrong.

22:42.236 --> 22:43.070
It's bigger.

22:53.956 --> 22:56.000
Call Delgetti. We'll need more men.

23:01.630 --> 23:03.632
[water boiling]

23:22.902 --> 23:24.320
Holy, can you...

23:24.403 --> 23:25.237
Do you...

23:28.782 --> 23:29.658
Okay.

23:33.495 --> 23:34.330
[man] Taxi!

23:44.673 --> 23:46.675
[people chattering]

23:47.092 --> 23:49.094
[cardiograph beeping]

23:49.929 --> 23:51.931
[pants]

23:55.643 --> 23:56.936
[sighs] Dolores.

23:59.605 --> 24:00.439
Dolores.

24:02.775 --> 24:03.609
Please.

24:04.443 --> 24:05.277
No.

24:06.612 --> 24:07.446
Dolores.

24:10.699 --> 24:11.575
Dolores.

24:17.373 --> 24:19.708
Dolores? How is he spelling it?

24:20.125 --> 24:22.795
He's not spelling it, Ryan,
he's talking in his sleep.

24:24.797 --> 24:28.926
[Ryan] <i>His mother's name was Camilla.</i>
<i>He has a sister named Miriam.</i>

24:29.510 --> 24:31.345
I don't see any Dolores here at all.

24:32.304 --> 24:33.931
Hold on. I have an idea.

24:34.181 --> 24:35.432
It's kind of a long shot,

24:35.516 --> 24:37.017
but my friend, Corey Zweibel,

24:37.101 --> 24:40.229
has invented a machine
that can see into people's dreams.

24:40.729 --> 24:43.190
[Ryan]
<i>It's not like 100 percent accurate, but--</i>

24:45.275 --> 24:46.110
Hello?

24:47.111 --> 24:49.822
-We got disconnected.
-[Burl] That must happen a lot.

24:52.408 --> 24:53.242
It does.

24:54.493 --> 24:55.911
It happens all the time.

25:01.291 --> 25:03.585
[Tony Sr.] Hey, Joe, how's it going?
See you.

25:04.503 --> 25:05.337
Dad.

25:07.548 --> 25:08.757
I know you're still mad.

25:11.176 --> 25:13.220
Anyway, look,
I've been crunching the numbers.

25:13.345 --> 25:14.179
Look.

25:15.055 --> 25:17.850
We can make the mandated repairs.
We could fix the freezer.

25:17.933 --> 25:20.769
We can buy a new warming oven.
We can report our income, even the cash.

25:20.853 --> 25:21.770
We're still good.

25:22.146 --> 25:24.565
We won't be rich,
but we can keep the doors open.

25:24.857 --> 25:26.567
[Tony Sr. tsks] Where'd you get that book?

25:27.151 --> 25:28.027
From your office.

25:30.029 --> 25:30.904
What's that?

25:31.071 --> 25:32.990
That's the other book, the real book.

25:33.866 --> 25:36.076
-We have two sets of books?
-At least.

25:41.707 --> 25:42.624
Oh.

25:46.628 --> 25:48.047
[louder] Oh!

25:53.052 --> 25:55.054
[sighs]

25:56.180 --> 25:58.766
-This is different.
-[chuckles] Isn't it though?

25:59.725 --> 26:03.020
The party's over, kid.
We've got to close up shop.

26:03.687 --> 26:04.521
I'm sorry, Dad.

26:06.023 --> 26:08.442
I know how much this place means to you.
I know you...

26:09.109 --> 26:12.071
-You still think I'm partly responsible--
-Partly responsible?

26:12.154 --> 26:14.907
You know what? Wait a minute...
Why am I apologizing?

26:15.282 --> 26:16.950
You're the one with two sets of books.

26:17.034 --> 26:18.952
You're the one putting water
in the scotch,

26:19.036 --> 26:21.455
and telling Wendell Kirk
to go threaten Yelp reviewers.

26:21.538 --> 26:23.499
Well, a real partner would've looked
the other way.

26:23.582 --> 26:25.167
True, a partner would've...

26:25.793 --> 26:26.877
but a son wouldn't.

26:27.294 --> 26:28.212
I can't, Dad...

26:28.837 --> 26:30.172
because I love you,

26:31.048 --> 26:32.633
and I want you to be a better man.

26:32.925 --> 26:34.927
[people chattering]

26:36.929 --> 26:39.306
No. No, that's not fair.

26:40.808 --> 26:43.185
-What?
-That better man stuff.

26:44.603 --> 26:46.146
Your mother used to say stuff like that.

26:47.606 --> 26:48.816
[sighs]

26:52.611 --> 26:55.155
-Now, what are you doing?
-What?

26:55.364 --> 26:58.492
-You know what, cut it out.
-I'm not doing anything.

26:58.575 --> 27:00.661
You're reminding me of her,
cut it out.

27:01.078 --> 27:02.204
I'm just sitting here.

27:02.371 --> 27:03.664
I mean it TJ, stop it.

27:03.747 --> 27:05.916
-I can't help it, Dad--
-I'm serious.

27:06.250 --> 27:08.669
-What do you want me to do?
-I'm gonna count to three.

27:08.794 --> 27:09.962
-Want me to move--
-One...

27:10.045 --> 27:11.463
-Want me to look--
-Two...

27:11.713 --> 27:14.925
Tony. TJ. You know Chuck Everett.

27:15.175 --> 27:18.178
Of course, the Prince of Wall Street.
How you doing? How was your lunch?

27:18.262 --> 27:20.013
Excellent as always. <i>Bravissimo.</i>

27:20.222 --> 27:21.723
Jocelyn mentioned the two of you

27:21.807 --> 27:24.601
may have hit some turbulence
with this place which doesn't surprise me,

27:24.685 --> 27:26.395
especially, being a new venture and all.

27:26.603 --> 27:29.022
Chuck manages
a rather successful hedge fund.

27:29.106 --> 27:30.482
Rather successful?

27:30.732 --> 27:33.610
That's like calling the 61' Yankees
rather successful.

27:34.027 --> 27:35.404
No, I read the papers.

27:35.529 --> 27:38.115
The last two years, this guy's been
beating the market by 20 points.

27:38.198 --> 27:40.701
-Nobody knows how he does it.
-My secret is simple.

27:40.993 --> 27:42.494
I'm a lucky son of a bitch.

27:42.661 --> 27:44.705
And I like to share my good fortune
with friends

27:44.788 --> 27:46.540
and people that I respect. So...

27:46.999 --> 27:51.128
If you're looking for an infusion,
I'd like to invest $800,000 in cash.

27:52.504 --> 27:53.422
Invest?

27:54.047 --> 27:55.716
You mean like? In us?

27:55.799 --> 27:58.343
Wait a minute.
What kind of cut you looking for?

27:58.427 --> 27:59.469
Thirty, 40 percent?

27:59.636 --> 28:02.848
I was thinking more along
the lines of 5 percent. After expenses.

28:02.931 --> 28:04.433
I'm not looking
to change a thing here.

28:04.516 --> 28:07.477
It's your restaurant, it's your vision.
But the truth is...

28:07.686 --> 28:09.813
I can't afford to let
this place go under.

28:10.063 --> 28:13.483
I'm in love with your mushroom ravioli.
It's like a drug, I love it!

28:13.567 --> 28:16.069
[laughs]
You know, that was the plan all along.

28:16.570 --> 28:18.906
Good. So... Let's make this happen.

28:18.989 --> 28:20.782
Alright? My office
is right across the street.

28:20.866 --> 28:23.035
Why don't you come see me?
Ten o'clock, tomorrow.

28:23.118 --> 28:24.411
I look forward to seeing you.

28:30.042 --> 28:30.876
I forgive you.

28:31.251 --> 28:32.085
[laughs]

28:33.462 --> 28:35.464
[cardiograph beeping]

28:42.888 --> 28:44.848
Mr. Santini, how are you feeling?

28:47.976 --> 28:49.436
Do you want to tell me about Dolores?

28:51.271 --> 28:54.608
-How do you know that name?
-You talk in your sleep.

28:57.694 --> 29:00.405
You got family? You got people you love?

29:01.406 --> 29:04.368
[in a trembling voice]
Forget that name. You hear me?

29:04.451 --> 29:06.536
-[cardiograph beeps faster]
-For your own good.

29:07.579 --> 29:08.455
Forget that name.

29:08.664 --> 29:10.123
His blood pressure, please.

29:10.290 --> 29:12.292
[Santini sniffs and pants]

29:12.918 --> 29:14.002
Forget the name.

29:24.721 --> 29:26.556
[recorded conversation]
<i>he FDA will approve it.</i>

29:26.640 --> 29:28.433
<i>These tests are just a formality.</i>

29:29.101 --> 29:31.144
<i>I know Kensing</i>
<i>and half the board of directors.</i>

29:31.228 --> 29:32.854
<i>They're waiting for us</i>
<i>to pull the trigger.</i>

29:33.146 --> 29:35.148
[laughing]

29:35.565 --> 29:36.566
Who are we listening to?

29:37.401 --> 29:40.779
That was yesterday, 1:30 p.m.

29:40.946 --> 29:42.531
Wilson Conley from JP Morgan

29:42.614 --> 29:45.033
and the CTT of Kenzing Pharmaceuticals.

29:45.450 --> 29:47.577
[Chuck] Sounds like
they're planning a hostile bid.

29:47.661 --> 29:49.204
They'll probably announce
Monday morning.

29:49.288 --> 29:50.122
What's it worth?

29:50.455 --> 29:51.581
Information like this?

29:52.207 --> 29:53.041
If I'm smart...

29:53.125 --> 29:54.084
Which you are.

29:54.751 --> 29:56.795
-...and careful...
-Which you are.

29:58.046 --> 29:58.964
Fourteen million.

30:02.843 --> 30:05.220
And only four people in the world
know about it.

30:05.429 --> 30:06.805
The two of them...

30:07.806 --> 30:08.640
and the two of us.

30:08.724 --> 30:10.892
Why do I feel like
we just won the lottery?

30:10.976 --> 30:14.938
Like I said, everyone wants to sit
at Sinatra's table.

30:16.106 --> 30:18.442
It's the gift that keeps on giving.

30:20.027 --> 30:23.822
[Chuck] Right, but let's be careful.
We don't need any more curious busboys.

30:25.657 --> 30:27.534
[maitre d'] Porfirio wasn't curious.

30:27.993 --> 30:29.077
He was unlucky.

30:30.162 --> 30:33.749
[Chuck] Do you think about him?
Do you think about having him killed?

30:34.166 --> 30:35.000
No.

30:36.668 --> 30:37.669
I think about us.

30:40.464 --> 30:42.674
We need to keep our eye on the prize.

30:43.550 --> 30:48.138
Your meeting with Tony and his son
later today, and we cannot afford...

30:48.597 --> 30:50.265
to have that restaurant go under.

30:50.349 --> 30:52.517
I understand,
but it's not that easy.

30:52.642 --> 30:55.937
Big Tony and his son are the worst
businessmen I've ever met in my life.

30:56.063 --> 30:59.399
One's a compulsive thief,
the other's... pathologically honest.

31:00.275 --> 31:01.526
The crook and the shnook.

31:02.778 --> 31:05.113
I can't believe they haven't killed
each other by now.

31:05.197 --> 31:06.782
[both laugh]

31:07.741 --> 31:09.284
Detective. This just arrived.

31:11.578 --> 31:12.412
What is it?

31:12.704 --> 31:14.623
It's a search warrant.
I'm checking his apartment.

31:14.706 --> 31:15.707
Should I stay here?

31:15.999 --> 31:18.585
Well, not right there.
I've got to get out the door.

31:18.752 --> 31:19.586
Oh, right.

31:20.003 --> 31:20.837
Okay.

32:15.267 --> 32:16.726
Thank you, by the way.

32:17.269 --> 32:18.311
Don't thank me yet.

32:18.770 --> 32:19.604
Here you go.

32:30.449 --> 32:31.324
He's into the weather.

32:32.951 --> 32:34.244
[man] He's into insanity.

32:48.300 --> 32:51.178
-[girl] Dolores. Come here, Dolores.
-[dog barks]

32:53.763 --> 32:54.598
[girl] Sit.

32:54.681 --> 32:55.974
Sit.

32:56.725 --> 32:57.767
That's a good girl.

32:58.768 --> 33:00.312
Good girl, Dolores.

33:01.688 --> 33:02.689
Oh my God.

33:03.023 --> 33:04.858
[Ryan] Dolores is a dog?

33:05.025 --> 33:07.360
A seven year old collie,
that lives next door.

33:08.028 --> 33:09.196
Porfirio's convinced...

33:09.362 --> 33:11.781
the neighbor's dog
can control the weather.

33:12.532 --> 33:13.366
Can it?

33:15.076 --> 33:16.036
No.

33:16.244 --> 33:17.787
[huffs] Thank God.

33:18.580 --> 33:20.832
Porfirio number two, is a lunatic.

33:21.041 --> 33:22.751
He's a paranoid schizophrenic,

33:22.834 --> 33:24.169
emphasis on paranoid.

33:25.212 --> 33:26.505
And schizophrenic.

33:26.963 --> 33:28.006
Emphasis on both.

33:28.381 --> 33:30.509
Crazy or not,
someone did try to kill him.

33:30.967 --> 33:35.096
Same two bangers that killed the busboy.
They used the same gun. Ballistics match.

33:35.180 --> 33:36.890
There's definitely a connection.

33:37.474 --> 33:38.350
Any ideas?

33:38.433 --> 33:39.392
I have a couple...

33:39.768 --> 33:40.602
but...

33:40.727 --> 33:42.646
[sucks lips] they don't make any sense.

33:44.147 --> 33:45.815
-Take care, Joe. See you.
-Bye Tony.

33:46.274 --> 33:47.150
What, no goodbye?

33:48.818 --> 33:49.653
Hey.

33:50.028 --> 33:51.238
You want me to lock up?

33:53.657 --> 33:55.700
-[Tony Sr. flashbacks]
-<i>No, please.</i>

33:55.784 --> 33:59.246
<i>Please don't. Don't.</i><i>No, please don't! No!</i>

34:02.374 --> 34:05.126
No... No, I'm fine. You go ahead,
get some sleep.

34:05.710 --> 34:06.628
-Okay.
-Okay.

<i>The heavy hitters.</i>

34:28.108 --> 34:29.818
<i>They all want Sinatra's table.</i>

34:32.862 --> 34:34.990
<i>For two years, this guy's beat</i>
<i>the market by 20 points.</i>

34:35.073 --> 34:36.533
<i>Nobody can figure out</i>
<i>how he does it.</i>

34:37.033 --> 34:40.078
<i>My secret is simple.</i>
<i>I'm a lucky son of a bitch.</i>

34:41.329 --> 34:43.373
[TJ] <i>We can't find the motive.</i>
<i>That's the bottom line.</i>

34:44.207 --> 34:47.377
<i>Maybe, he was afraid of something?</i>
<i>On the morning he was killed,</i>

34:47.794 --> 34:49.838
<i>he bought a plane ticket back to Bogota.</i>

35:24.748 --> 35:26.583
[Tony Sr.]
Bless me, Father, for I have sinned.

35:26.666 --> 35:28.960
It's been five weeks
since my last confession.

35:29.544 --> 35:30.545
Maybe you remember,

35:30.629 --> 35:32.756
I was seeing a woman
named Belinda Mannix?

35:32.881 --> 35:34.841
Yeah, the model who hired the hitman.

35:34.966 --> 35:36.426
[Tony Sr.] You remember that?

35:36.801 --> 35:40.221
Yeah, she was a model who hired a hitman.
It was a rather unique problem.

35:40.305 --> 35:43.975
Yeah, well it turns out it wasn't as...
as unique as we thought, Father...

35:44.643 --> 35:46.436
[sighs and grunts] Here's the thing, I...

35:46.603 --> 35:47.854
I bought a restaurant...

35:48.146 --> 35:49.022
and I love it.

35:49.230 --> 35:50.523
I'm so proud of it.

35:51.483 --> 35:52.317
I think it's...

35:53.109 --> 35:55.362
as close to Heaven
as I'll probably ever get.

35:57.572 --> 35:59.616
See, I thought you might argue
with me there.

36:01.034 --> 36:01.868
[Father] Go on.

36:02.577 --> 36:06.373
I recently learned that my restaurant
is being used as a front.

36:07.248 --> 36:08.124
[Father] A front?

36:08.208 --> 36:10.126
Yes, some criminals have...

36:11.044 --> 36:12.629
planted a microphone...

36:13.004 --> 36:15.840
at this particular table
and they've been listening in...

36:16.591 --> 36:17.801
getting stock tips,

36:18.093 --> 36:19.302
and inside information.

36:19.844 --> 36:21.304
And that's not all. They...

36:21.763 --> 36:22.847
They killed a busboy.

36:23.473 --> 36:25.975
-[Father] They killed a busboy?
-Or had him killed.

36:27.018 --> 36:28.061
Here's the thing...

36:28.812 --> 36:31.147
One of these criminals, is my new partner.

36:31.690 --> 36:34.359
I've taken a large chunk of money
from him and...

36:35.443 --> 36:36.486
if I turn him in...

36:37.487 --> 36:38.947
I'll lose my restaurant.

36:39.447 --> 36:41.449
So, I think you could see my problem.

36:41.950 --> 36:44.577
[Father] I can't. If they killed
a man, you have to turn him in.

36:44.661 --> 36:46.788
[Tony Sr.] I know, it's a real dilemma.

36:46.871 --> 36:51.000
-It's not, I'm telling you what to do.
-[Tony Sr.] I agree. It's impossible.

36:51.084 --> 36:52.043
There's no right answer.

36:52.127 --> 36:54.170
-There is a right answer.
-It's such a grey area.

36:54.254 --> 36:55.505
[Father] It's not a grey area.

36:55.839 --> 37:00.051
Bottom line, Father Kokesh.
What would you do, if you were me?

37:00.802 --> 37:01.886
I would turn them in.

37:02.262 --> 37:03.096
Father...

37:03.388 --> 37:04.806
with all due respect.

37:05.598 --> 37:07.475
I don't think you heard the question.

37:08.059 --> 37:09.936
What would you do, if you were me?

37:12.230 --> 37:13.982
[Father]
Anthony, let me ask you a question.

37:16.151 --> 37:17.318
What would Connie do?

37:36.421 --> 37:37.255
You still up?

37:38.173 --> 37:40.467
Yeah. No rest for the wicked.

37:41.426 --> 37:43.219
There's some piccata in the fridge.

37:43.303 --> 37:44.345
I'm good, I...

37:44.763 --> 37:45.680
grabbed something.

37:46.181 --> 37:48.516
Kid, we own a restaurant,
stop buying dinner.

37:49.684 --> 37:51.519
We've hit a wall in this busboy thing.

37:52.937 --> 37:54.063
[TJ sighs]

37:55.607 --> 37:56.566
Can I talk to you?

37:57.984 --> 37:58.818
Cop to cop?

37:59.819 --> 38:00.779
Cop to cop?

38:01.654 --> 38:02.489
Sure.

38:04.949 --> 38:05.950
We have two victims.

38:06.409 --> 38:08.578
Both have the same name,
Porfirio Santini.

38:09.579 --> 38:11.080
One's a busboy from Bogota,

38:11.331 --> 38:12.373
the other one's a...

38:12.540 --> 38:13.708
nut job from Mars.

38:14.876 --> 38:18.880
[huffs] Here's what I can't get past.
They were both shot with the same gun.

38:19.130 --> 38:20.548
Why would any professional do that?

38:20.632 --> 38:22.926
They'd know we'd run a ballistics test
and connect them.

38:24.677 --> 38:26.805
I think they wanted us
to connect them.

38:27.972 --> 38:30.850
Ryan floated this theory...
based on the <i>Terminator</i> movie.

38:31.100 --> 38:33.311
We thought he was crazy,
until the next morning...

38:33.436 --> 38:34.395
Ten hours later...

38:35.146 --> 38:36.272
they shot the nut job.

38:36.439 --> 38:40.235
So, we started to focus on the nut job,
we stopped looking at the busboy.

38:41.319 --> 38:42.237
Aha!

38:42.362 --> 38:45.031
It's as if the killers...
knew what we were thinking.

38:45.114 --> 38:46.574
As if they heard us talking.

38:48.326 --> 38:49.619
Maybe, there's a leak?

38:50.703 --> 38:51.579
In my department?

38:51.830 --> 38:53.581
Who? Loomis? Ryan?

38:53.790 --> 38:54.916
No. Impossible.

38:56.292 --> 38:58.461
Maybe... someone overheard you?

38:58.586 --> 38:59.462
Another cop.

38:59.921 --> 39:02.882
We weren't in the squad room,
we were in the restaurant at table seven.

39:05.635 --> 39:08.346
Maybe... they heard you!

39:10.014 --> 39:11.724
Maybe, table seven is bugged.

39:13.685 --> 39:15.061
Maybe, there's a secret transmitter

39:15.144 --> 39:16.896
in the base
of the Frank Sinatra microphone,

39:16.980 --> 39:20.525
and, maybe, Chuck Everett and Jocelyn
have been monitoring it for months.

39:26.698 --> 39:27.532
Maybe.

39:29.868 --> 39:30.702
Cop to cop.

39:41.462 --> 39:42.630
[Tony Sr.] Wake him up.

39:43.548 --> 39:45.675
I don't care what time it is,
wake him up.

39:46.718 --> 39:49.178
You tell him this is the biggest
insider-trading case

39:49.262 --> 39:50.763
in the history of the SEC.

39:51.598 --> 39:53.766
[Tony Sr.] <i>No, not on the phone. No.</i>

39:54.392 --> 39:55.685
<i>Tell him to meet me here.</i>

39:57.353 --> 39:59.272
<i>Yeah, I'll be here for two more hours.</i>

39:59.939 --> 40:00.773
<i>Okay.</i>

40:01.900 --> 40:04.402
-He's meeting with the SEC.
-How much does he know?

40:04.485 --> 40:06.696
Even a little is too much,

40:06.779 --> 40:08.740
we have to move fast.

40:11.367 --> 40:12.243
Make the call.

40:52.367 --> 40:54.369
[machine-gun shots]

41:00.166 --> 41:02.293
[shouts]
NYPD! Drop your weapons, on your knees!

41:02.460 --> 41:03.294
Do it now!

41:04.045 --> 41:05.630
Drop your weapons, slowly.

41:05.713 --> 41:07.131
[policemen shouting]

41:07.298 --> 41:08.633
On your knees, let's go!

41:08.716 --> 41:09.676
-]Gun.
-Cuff him.

41:09.842 --> 41:11.052
-Hands.
-Come here.

41:11.844 --> 41:13.137
-Got him.
-Are you okay?

41:16.599 --> 41:17.475
Yeah...

41:17.767 --> 41:18.601
I'm good.

41:19.185 --> 41:20.103
I'm good.

41:20.186 --> 41:21.354
That's one dead dummy.

41:21.980 --> 41:23.982
Well, I'm glad they got the right dummy.

41:26.401 --> 41:28.403
[police siren]

41:47.088 --> 41:48.798
We'll have to replace the chairs.

41:49.882 --> 41:50.717
Not only that.

41:51.634 --> 41:53.886
They shot up $70,000 worth of liquor.

41:59.392 --> 42:01.644
They shot up $40,000 worth of liquor.

42:08.276 --> 42:10.945
They shot up $20,000 worth of liquor.

42:15.158 --> 42:16.200
They shot up ten--

42:18.661 --> 42:19.954
I cannot work with you.
