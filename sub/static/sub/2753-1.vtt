"Welcome to Inveree"

06:42.277 --> 06:43.199
Fuck!

06:44.738 --> 06:46.035
Oh fuck, shit!

06:56.917 --> 06:57.918
From the car off!

06:59.586 --> 07:02.089
No, No, no, no, damn it,

07:02.505 --> 07:03.677
Please not another,

07:10.847 --> 07:11.939
Where did he go?

07:13.141 --> 07:14.063
Who then?

07:15.143 --> 07:17.942
The man you've just run over,

07:18.355 --> 07:21.279
But apparently I did not,

07:22.317 --> 07:24.194
And so there is no reason,
arrest me,

07:25.695 --> 07:28.574
This is probably my lucky night,
-Meinst You?

07:30.408 --> 07:32.285
Listen, I'm damn rights,

07:38.416 --> 07:41.295
Not so hard! Tell Just,
that you would like to dominate,

07:41.503 --> 07:42.629
then we take a room,

07:46.007 --> 07:49.307
You know, handcuffs are at
the police here rather unusual,

07:49.511 --> 07:53.516
Oh really? As a girl, I
a soft spot for wristbands,

07:55.850 --> 07:59.400
"Missing"

08:09.155 --> 08:10.281
Sergeant MacReady '?

08:12.117 --> 08:13.494
They come with gifts?

08:14.244 --> 08:17.339
Yes, My mother taught me,
never show up empty-handed,

08:17.914 --> 08:19.666
Well that's all well before going on,

08:20.000 --> 08:22.674
The young Caesar is one of our
Regular customers, do not you, boy?

08:22.919 --> 08:26.173
Yes, but this is bullshit, Jim,
I did not do anything, I swear,

08:26.464 --> 08:28.683
For you, Sergeant MacReady, boy,

08:29.926 --> 08:32.054
And I am the way,
Constable Rachel Heggie,

08:32.261 --> 08:36.107
But of course, They seem
yes to be quite eagerly,

08:37.058 --> 08:39.106
The only question is, why you
are then stranded here?

08:40.520 --> 08:43.239
We all have to start somewhere,
-Yes, And believe me,

08:43.440 --> 08:45.113
from here it can only go up,

08:46.735 --> 08:48.032
I have told you before,

08:49.320 --> 08:52.415
Pass on what you say,
-Large God!

08:52.615 --> 08:54.538
Also for you, do not take that tone, Thank You,

08:55.827 --> 08:58.876
There are a few croutons for you here,
-Okay,

08:59.956 --> 09:01.958
Then we want you times
message in the guestbook,

09:05.920 --> 09:06.716
Yes!

09:07.630 --> 09:09.974
Fuck! -I Am coming!
Still -Wait, I also equal!

09:17.265 --> 09:18.482
Oh Man ,,,

09:21.186 --> 09:25.032
I swear,
My Joanne was never so tight

09:25.356 --> 09:30.032
even before she got the kids,
-The Makes the pelvic floor muscles, sweetheart,

09:32.030 --> 09:33.156
Ready for another round? '

09:33.990 --> 09:35.333
Oh fuck, give me a minute,

09:37.994 --> 09:38.961
Lightweight,

09:40.497 --> 09:41.498
Bitch,

09:42.957 --> 09:45.176
How did you just call me?
-You Heard,

09:47.462 --> 09:48.554
Bitch,

09:52.175 --> 09:53.301
Mother's again,

09:56.513 --> 10:01.690
So then:Francis Sargison,
also known as Caesar,

10:03.353 --> 10:06.197
Again a joyride, yes?
-But This time without fun,

10:06.523 --> 10:08.821
And your driver's license?

10:10.443 --> 10:14.038
He almost killed someone,
Ah, no, I have not,

10:14.364 --> 10:18.369
Where is the victim?
-Good That you ask, Caesar,

10:18.618 --> 10:22.088
That's what I'll find out
while you strip,

10:23.957 --> 10:25.174
Hop hop!

10:30.505 --> 10:33.224
Mundie ,,, come on down!

10:35.218 --> 10:36.936
I think we'd better back,

10:40.140 --> 10:41.062
Come on,

10:52.318 --> 10:53.240
You animal!

10:57.115 --> 11:01.586
Ah, it goes straight to the point,
Let the prelude from simple?

11:03.163 --> 11:06.884
This will now be under profiling, Sarge,
I'm prejudiced here,

11:07.333 --> 11:10.132
If you were part of a minority,
Who would you maybe interested in,

11:15.175 --> 11:17.177
Here is the squad leader,
Are you there, people?

11:18.178 --> 11:19.600
<I> Warnock? Mundie? </ I>

11:21.723 --> 11:23.270
Present, Sarge, Loud and clear,

11:24.684 --> 11:25.981
Here someone wants to say "hello",

11:35.612 --> 11:39.207
Hi folks, here speaks
Constable Rachel Heggie,

11:39.407 --> 11:41.580
Please keep your eyes open
for a man - White,

11:41.826 --> 11:45.330
<I> 1 meter 80, beard and
likely to be injured, Thank you! </ I>

11:57.508 --> 11:59.351
We should also contact the local
Hospitals check,

11:59.552 --> 12:00.849
"Prisoner file"

12:01.054 --> 12:03.432
"Date of Birth:05/10/1957

12:03.431 --> 12:06.059
"Chronicle:Domestic violence currently
Domestic violence - 07,14,2014 "

12:15.818 --> 12:16.910
Sir?

12:18.154 --> 12:19.326
Sergeant MacReady '?

12:21.824 --> 12:25.499
Seriously, Constable, you are sure
They form is not an all?

12:25.954 --> 12:28.377
There was blood on the headlights, sir,
Well no,

12:29.123 --> 12:33.469
I would like to have the car checked,
if we had a victim, Is that so?

12:49.727 --> 12:53.698
I set up shop under control,
In most cases, it is quiet here,

12:55.358 --> 12:57.201
What do you mean?
-How They say:

12:58.069 --> 13:00.288
Without victim no crime,

13:01.489 --> 13:03.958
I told you,
I've told you,

13:04.575 --> 13:06.373
Oh God,
Sorry, what was that? '

13:06.577 --> 13:09.080
<I> Sierra One, what exactly do you mean by </ i>

13:09.247 --> 13:12.877
"White"? Shall we now have a
Search fucking snowman?

13:15.253 --> 13:17.347
Flap! Makes your job and find him,

13:18.881 --> 13:21.225
Yes, sir, Sarge, We keep our eyes open,

13:22.343 --> 13:23.310
It's just ,,,

13:24.554 --> 13:27.148
<I> sounds as fun to
can be as suspect their testimony, </ i>

13:27.348 --> 13:28.565
That's enough!

13:30.184 --> 13:32.983
Please bring us even with a coffee,
We sit on dry land,

13:34.647 --> 13:35.648
Do you want anything?

13:36.316 --> 13:38.535
Except that confidential documents
be treated as such?

13:39.569 --> 13:40.786
No,

13:42.155 --> 13:44.078
Yeah, good luck with that,

13:44.407 --> 13:47.081
Even at the local nail salon
hear less gossip than here,

14:23.237 --> 14:24.159
Hello?

14:25.198 --> 14:26.165
Hello?

14:32.747 --> 14:34.249
Can I smoke a lot
before I get involved?

14:35.041 --> 14:36.884
Here's smoking ban,
-Is This a joke?

14:40.129 --> 14:41.176
Your room, sir,

14:43.132 --> 14:45.351
Have fun with the free
Skid marks on the pillow,

14:45.885 --> 14:47.228
I had half a box
Cigarettes when I came here,

14:47.637 --> 14:49.981
That was all counted accurately,
-Now Tell me you suspect

14:50.139 --> 14:51.891
that we steal your butts,

14:52.392 --> 14:53.644
He assumed it,

14:54.936 --> 14:57.280
He will be assumed
you steal his butts,

14:58.106 --> 15:01.531
A spokesman assumed
a listener suspected,

15:03.069 --> 15:06.198
The one place where it is felt
To be sure - and there he is,

15:08.533 --> 15:10.035
Something you have to swallow, Caesar,

15:10.701 --> 15:13.500
Is nice if you have more time than
than at school want to spend,

15:14.330 --> 15:17.504
We thought we doing you a favor
and bring the school to you,

15:20.086 --> 15:21.383
Why is he here?

15:22.338 --> 15:25.888
Because he just like his women
likes his whiskey - 12 Years Old?

15:26.968 --> 15:29.721
Constable Heggie, Mr, Beswick,

15:32.014 --> 15:34.733
You complain yet
constantly about class sizes,

15:35.435 --> 15:39.781
This is our way to help
with some private lessons,

15:48.322 --> 15:50.324
That's it, right? He is a fanatic,

15:51.659 --> 15:54.378
I knew it, Dirty pervert,

15:56.414 --> 15:58.963
Go back, away from the door,
-How's It twice with "please", bitch?

16:00.710 --> 16:03.054
What the hell? That's assault,

16:03.671 --> 16:05.844
Man, fuck brutality!

16:07.341 --> 16:09.435
Just do it,
what is said to you, bitch,

16:12.555 --> 16:13.522
Okay, all right,

16:15.308 --> 16:18.152
You saw that, right?
You are my witness,

16:18.686 --> 16:21.360
She was trying to break my arm,
-I Have not seen anything,

16:21.731 --> 16:23.904
Oh come on, wake up!
If we approach this correctly,

16:24.108 --> 16:25.985
we are still before the last
Round out here,

16:26.486 --> 16:28.329
You simply have to say,
what you have seen,

16:28.946 --> 16:31.916
I'll sue you, and this
Be photographed scratches,

16:32.116 --> 16:35.541
Sometimes, Francis,
need to be disciplined people,

16:35.703 --> 16:37.125
This preserves the natural order,

16:38.206 --> 16:39.332
Is that what you did? '

16:40.124 --> 16:41.546
I have read the file,

16:43.586 --> 16:46.715
Pretty dirty,
how to maintain order, right?

16:48.049 --> 16:51.394
Well, every story has two sides,
-sure, Of course,

16:52.220 --> 16:54.348
Yours is certainly true maudlin,

17:08.653 --> 17:13.204
So one, my boy, is commonly
known as a wire brush,

17:23.917 --> 17:27.343
The salvage people do not respond,
I need to call a tow truck later,

17:29.882 --> 17:31.509
Provoke getting your prisoner?

17:34.595 --> 17:36.313
In fact, I do not even smoke,

17:37.265 --> 17:41.315
Types such as Caesar come with
Authority not well understood,

17:42.436 --> 17:43.904
So I use a number
different methods,

17:45.565 --> 17:46.782
And cell 4?

17:47.650 --> 17:50.119
He seems pretty convinced of
Ralph?

17:52.530 --> 17:54.407
This man needs a sandbag,

17:55.199 --> 17:56.997
His wife is for all
certainly not suitable,

17:58.411 --> 18:00.880
He is also a regular guest here?
-You Can set the clock after,

18:01.622 --> 18:04.125
And I guarantee that it tomorrow
early the charges will drop,

18:05.543 --> 18:07.466
Unfortunately, a widespread problem,

18:09.130 --> 18:10.723
If there is abuse in relationships,

18:11.674 --> 18:13.051
Oh, that's so, Constable?

18:17.555 --> 18:20.479
The little girl,
the back, came here,

18:24.061 --> 18:26.610
The world is full of evil,
That goes double for police stations,

18:34.113 --> 18:36.912
Hey, hey, calm, buddy, This way,

18:39.118 --> 18:41.291
<I> Hey, Sarge? We found him, </ I>

18:42.371 --> 18:43.998
Ah, you must be the new one,

18:45.124 --> 18:46.216
Mundie,

18:46.626 --> 18:50.506
We've known,
I ,,, just kidding, you know?

18:51.172 --> 18:52.389
Good work, Mundie,

18:57.219 --> 18:59.187
Heggie? Warnock,

18:59.513 --> 19:03.268
Is that him? 1 meter 80, beard,
pretty spaced out,

19:03.434 --> 19:04.481
Yes, he is,

19:10.232 --> 19:12.109
They are straight before
run a car, what?

19:19.325 --> 19:22.124
He has a blow off in any case,
When we found him, he wandered around,

19:22.703 --> 19:23.875
He was right in front of us,

19:24.705 --> 19:25.957
and then just go away,

19:27.166 --> 19:30.386
Probably due to the adrenaline,
-Yes, But adrenaline decreases,

19:31.045 --> 19:33.139
Better call to Dr, Hume,
His number is on the wall,

19:33.839 --> 19:34.886
What is your name, sir?

19:36.509 --> 19:39.729
Cosy chat is
not with him, Sarge,

19:42.348 --> 19:43.941
Hi, I'm calling from the police station,

19:44.100 --> 19:46.319
We have an injured person here
the medical needs help,

19:47.019 --> 19:48.316
Your name, my friend?

19:50.022 --> 19:52.571
Honestly, I think,
from having a bit of a wheel, boss,

19:53.609 --> 19:55.031
It looks like a
From concussion,

19:55.569 --> 19:59.449
Thank You,
-What's Your name?

20:06.747 --> 20:09.216
And the first in your day,

20:11.585 --> 20:14.885
I tell you so that uniform does it,

20:31.230 --> 20:34.609
It thus seems women
Uniform to like what?

20:35.860 --> 20:36.907
Looks like,

20:38.154 --> 20:41.033
To me it's better if they only
Handcuffs and the hat wearing,

20:41.198 --> 20:42.950
but anyway ,,,

20:46.662 --> 20:48.460
Do I have to tie you about?

20:51.584 --> 20:52.836
Space, boy,

20:58.340 --> 21:00.593
Now let us all Medical Play, yes?

21:01.510 --> 21:02.682
Where is he?

21:03.679 --> 21:05.226
To the patient, please click here along, Doctor,

21:09.977 --> 21:11.729
Its injuries seem
just to be on the outside,

21:13.022 --> 21:14.695
No evidence of toxicity,

21:16.317 --> 21:17.534
So he has a clear head?

21:22.364 --> 21:24.207
He definitely has something about him,

21:26.160 --> 21:30.711
So I would say "yes",
His silence could be voluntary,

21:31.665 --> 21:33.167
Then he comes over night in a cell,

21:34.293 --> 21:37.046
Why that? His refusal to talk about?

21:37.463 --> 21:39.181
Well then we just vagrancy,

21:39.715 --> 21:42.559
In addition, he is tonight
went before a car, right?

21:43.052 --> 21:44.895
Until you his identity
have found

21:45.221 --> 21:47.315
it is probably best if he stays here,

21:48.265 --> 21:49.892
Have you found a name, Constable?

21:50.768 --> 21:53.647
No, No wallet, no ID,
no phone, no key,

21:54.480 --> 21:56.983
Only this book, which is full of names,

21:58.984 --> 22:00.406
Just what is his?

22:02.446 --> 22:06.201
If any, Maybe he just
only the phonebook depreciated,

22:06.575 --> 22:07.952
There is something compulsive,

22:08.410 --> 22:11.880
There are small icons, small characters,
It must have a meaning for him,

22:12.915 --> 22:16.340
I told you so,
the guy has a Hau away,

22:16.669 --> 22:19.388
Since you can sometimes nice
determine Heggie, right?

22:20.548 --> 22:23.142
Find out! Try it
times during the pat mills,

22:23.342 --> 22:25.970
Maybe even a missing security wing
his diarist,

22:27.596 --> 22:28.939
So I got him safely
never seen before,

22:30.349 --> 22:34.604
What is unusual,
in such a small town here,

22:34.770 --> 22:36.818
And damn lifeless it is,

22:40.442 --> 22:42.786
I beg your pardon? What did he just say?

22:45.364 --> 22:46.616
Doctor Hume?

23:14.393 --> 23:16.361
He knows it,
-What Does he know?

23:20.274 --> 23:21.241
Everything,

23:33.662 --> 23:36.415
What does he know, Duncan?
What does he know?

24:02.024 --> 24:04.618
So, so, Doctor Hume,

24:05.069 --> 24:07.197
He's here to view our
To cure diseases,

24:09.615 --> 24:12.368
What is it, Doctor? Are you here,
to investigate my wrist?

24:15.037 --> 24:17.210
Go back cushion Hume,
-From Moral superiority

24:17.373 --> 24:18.875
You are here below all
far away, Doctor,

24:19.458 --> 24:22.052
But we all make mistakes, right?

24:22.252 --> 24:25.051
Take care of your stuff, Beswick,
-Oh, I will, if he does it well,

24:25.923 --> 24:29.894
But if I can not stand one
then a hypocrite,

24:30.219 --> 24:32.642
How do you explain your
Presence tonight?

24:35.307 --> 24:38.311
An whopping Swatter for Mr, Beswick!
-And What brings you this? '

24:38.519 --> 24:39.395
I could watch,

24:39.603 --> 24:42.152
And now have a cool little
Story for all my friends,

24:42.523 --> 24:45.151
Threaten you about me, Francis?
-I Name is Caesar,

24:45.693 --> 24:48.822
And no, I open
only the discussion,

24:49.321 --> 24:53.872
what my silence you and the
good doctor could be whom,

24:54.493 --> 24:57.042
You know, maybe I am
not literate,

24:57.204 --> 25:00.708
Mr, Beswick, but I ,,,
-You Are not smart, Caesar,

25:03.711 --> 25:04.678
You're an idiot,

25:05.629 --> 25:07.051
So just sit back,

25:07.881 --> 25:09.178
Keep your mouth shut

25:10.592 --> 25:12.094
and listen to flush out the wildlife,

25:22.062 --> 25:25.157
She used it for a can of cider and
made a thumb in the ass with everyone,

25:26.358 --> 25:30.079
The evolutionary ladder climbs up
not saying anything, boy?

26:02.936 --> 26:05.280
Small, sticky fingers,

26:39.348 --> 26:43.854
So, according to our records
and your fingerprints

26:44.353 --> 26:48.074
Are you Alexander Monroe from Port Glasgow,

26:49.983 --> 26:53.578
And you are died in 1983,
In a fire

26:54.321 --> 26:56.323
at the age of 79 years,

27:00.327 --> 27:01.704
I must say you look healthy from, Al,

27:03.330 --> 27:05.128
The advantage of a clear conscience,

27:05.624 --> 27:08.093
And this

27:08.627 --> 27:10.550
is applied modern policing,

27:11.588 --> 27:14.216
Technology, completely unreliable,

27:15.050 --> 27:17.929
But tonight we
proceed according to the old school,

27:22.391 --> 27:24.314
Keep it up, then make
we really "perhaps,

27:29.565 --> 27:30.782
Okay,

27:32.359 --> 27:34.908
Let's forget for a minute
who you are, and ask why,

27:35.612 --> 27:38.240
For example, why did you
Doctor Hume attacked?

27:38.615 --> 27:41.585
Because the clock is ticking and midnight approaches,

27:42.911 --> 27:44.254
He said, "you know it,"

27:45.080 --> 27:46.832
What exactly do you know?

27:51.753 --> 27:54.848
That the price of our
Sins are paid for with blood,

27:56.758 --> 27:58.977
And I ,,,

28:03.015 --> 28:05.188
"That I must be unsteady on earth,"

28:07.352 --> 28:10.401
"And that slay me,
whoever finds me, "

28:10.606 --> 28:11.607
I meant,

28:15.319 --> 28:16.571
One common feature,

28:17.696 --> 28:20.666
We are both Christians,
-Only That you have more to

28:20.908 --> 28:23.127
Old Testament tend, right?

28:29.666 --> 28:31.168
The blood and vengeance,

28:35.464 --> 28:36.556
The sweat

28:37.424 --> 28:38.846
and the sperm,

28:40.594 --> 28:41.720
I can smell it,

28:43.096 --> 28:44.894
I must say that I know
not from the Sunday School,

28:45.307 --> 28:47.981
I just do not - but I
am also exited,

28:51.021 --> 28:53.444
So do not believe in God?
-That I did not say that,

28:54.733 --> 28:56.326
But I would like damn
some say talk to him,

28:57.194 --> 28:58.696
It is not for us,
after asking why,

28:58.946 --> 29:05.124
No! Because we can do here
what we want, right?

29:13.210 --> 29:14.678
Create it away,

29:17.172 --> 29:18.219
Get him down!

29:19.633 --> 29:21.010
Coffins, I do not think so ,,,
Right Away!

29:47.286 --> 29:50.711
Oh wonderful! I just wanted to
ask up to a round of tea,

29:51.123 --> 29:53.125
Can it be that I'm above a
Pack of chocolate biscuits've seen?

30:09.141 --> 30:10.688
Listen, should tomorrow morning
You have to be out here, okay?

30:32.622 --> 30:33.874
Mundie?

30:37.753 --> 30:38.879
You damned ,,,

30:52.225 --> 30:54.444
Good God, are you okay?

31:40.565 --> 31:41.908
So who's the first?

31:46.696 --> 31:50.291
Hey, Hey, are you okay?
-Let It!

31:50.742 --> 31:54.042
It was nothing, Leave me alone!

31:55.122 --> 31:58.968
This "we have two girls
hold together number you can bend,

31:59.876 --> 32:02.846
You and I are not friends,

32:03.922 --> 32:05.549
We are nothing,

32:20.313 --> 32:21.530
Still busy with Mrs, Hume, Sarge,

32:28.822 --> 32:30.199
Sarge?

32:31.616 --> 32:33.414
It is now more than
an hour on the phone,

32:34.995 --> 32:39.000
The whole world could
Expert ability of these women testify,

32:40.041 --> 32:42.590
Driving times out and take with Jen,

32:43.545 --> 32:46.219
"Her husband is in prison"
is personally getting better,

32:47.299 --> 32:49.347
I think it is better,
if you do tell her, Sarge,

32:50.093 --> 32:52.596
I need to do some research here,

32:53.430 --> 32:56.730
Let's see if I can not figure out
who our top crafty friend really is,

32:58.393 --> 32:59.736
Rachel,

33:01.271 --> 33:03.023
You stay here and make
for us patrols,

33:03.315 --> 33:05.158
Drink tea,
answer the phone,

33:05.358 --> 33:06.575
bake a cake,

33:07.319 --> 33:10.823
Make just stay out of trouble, okay?
-Sir, Do you really think it's smart,

33:11.031 --> 33:12.874
a single police officer with four
To let prisoners alone?

33:13.450 --> 33:15.703
As long as you do not all
for a finger food buffet

33:15.952 --> 33:19.422
and a few rounds Bridge let out,
I mean even know this was possible,

33:22.584 --> 33:25.713
I am aware that you think, we live
here all in a fucking cookie jar,

33:28.298 --> 33:31.472
But the fact is that you made me a
very good reason have been allocated,

33:32.427 --> 33:34.395
I say this only once
for the cheap seats:

33:36.348 --> 33:38.100
If you want to survive the probationary period,

33:38.683 --> 33:41.106
you will learn to sit still,

33:41.895 --> 33:43.272
To curb your temper

33:43.855 --> 33:45.653
and to keep your damn mouth,

33:47.651 --> 33:48.618
Got it?

33:53.156 --> 33:57.878
<I> 25 </ i> years, I have never seen such a
blatant insubordination experienced,

34:01.414 --> 34:08.263
"Missing"

34:17.389 --> 34:22.020
We find that here is very convenient -
curb to the temperament,

34:22.768 --> 34:23.860
Hilarious,

34:26.856 --> 34:28.108
The Sarge has been right,

34:29.192 --> 34:31.034
You have at your social
Skills to work,

34:31.402 --> 34:34.156
I will definitely
take with you lessons,

34:35.739 --> 34:37.242
Just call your friend on,

34:38.409 --> 34:40.286
Thank you, I can do without it,

34:43.415 --> 34:46.840
Okay, well then have fun
with the crossword puzzle,

34:49.754 --> 34:51.097
On the one bites from the teeth,

34:56.052 --> 34:57.018
Night,

36:07.916 --> 36:10.385
I am very sure that you
provide a few more eggs,

36:10.835 --> 36:13.588
I do not want my French
Waive toast, not because of you,

36:14.923 --> 36:18.894
Who knows, maybe we are
tomorrow morning no longer here,

36:19.594 --> 36:22.393
Sure, of course, Have a
Escape plan or something?

36:23.264 --> 36:25.062
I thought you were the one
digging the tunnel,

36:26.559 --> 36:29.062
I decorate just my cell, man,

36:30.021 --> 36:32.194
Maybe you should learn first time,
how do you spell that, Francis,

36:32.357 --> 36:36.112
But that would mean that I time
spend in school - with you,

36:36.903 --> 36:39.827
And yet we're stuck here together firmly,

36:40.365 --> 36:42.117
in the midst of offenders,

36:42.409 --> 36:46.004
Right there you are also out -

36:46.996 --> 36:48.293
Mr, Beswick,

36:52.544 --> 36:53.636
How do you know my name?

36:56.965 --> 36:57.932
What do you think?

38:03.323 --> 38:05.997
"David Brundridge (the acid bath killer):
deceased "

38:19.756 --> 38:23.852
"Bryan Heffington (the whale):
deceased "

38:45.073 --> 38:46.290
<I> Wait until morning, </ I>

38:48.034 --> 38:50.537
Wait until you forgive you again,

38:53.081 --> 38:56.585
But no, that's not get it,

38:57.252 --> 38:58.299
Not this time,

38:59.128 --> 39:02.632
All the things you do, your punches,

39:03.716 --> 39:05.844
The uterus, the
You have chosen,

39:06.052 --> 39:07.554
the loss you have caused,

39:08.388 --> 39:10.561
They think it's about control?
Do not talk to me,

39:11.266 --> 39:12.813
That's not true,

39:13.601 --> 39:15.023
There is a lack of control,

39:17.188 --> 39:20.567
So much Situated Stautes, So much anger ,,,,

39:21.943 --> 39:24.196
Why should not I be angry?
-just Why?

39:25.864 --> 39:29.289
Who is it? To whom are
You really angry?

39:40.753 --> 39:41.970
I know of no beating husband,

39:42.130 --> 39:44.053
who does not actually
want to beat yourself,

39:45.758 --> 39:47.635
Or was it your unborn child?

39:53.725 --> 39:56.399
"Rodhe Kilpatrick (fishing home):
deceased "

39:59.856 --> 40:02.075
"Deceased - dead - died"

40:05.862 --> 40:07.239
Exactly,

40:08.364 --> 40:09.411
think about it,

40:11.743 --> 40:13.541
Think about it,
what you have done,

40:15.371 --> 40:18.045
Because ,,, who is she?

40:19.125 --> 40:22.049
Who is your wife?
-My Better half,

40:24.172 --> 40:27.051

40:28.343 --> 40:29.970

Who is it?

40:45.318 --> 40:46.410
Who do I hate?

40:53.076 --> 40:54.043
What the hell have I done?

40:55.161 --> 40:56.504
It is you,

and you did not even have enough
Emerge decency,
