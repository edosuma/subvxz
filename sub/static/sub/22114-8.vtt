00:06.847 --> 00:09.764
( theme music playing )

00:21.556 --> 00:23.473
( kissing )

00:24.930 --> 00:26.473
Uh-huh.

00:29.431 --> 00:32.306
( sighs )

00:32.306 --> 00:33.680
Come on.

00:33.680 --> 00:37.139
I can't look at that.
Take it away.

00:37.139 --> 00:39.473
- ( window opens )
- Hey, I'm trying to work.

00:39.473 --> 00:41.056
Sorry,
what's your problem?

00:41.056 --> 00:43.805
No one wants to see this.
It's very disturbing.

00:43.805 --> 00:45.473
Two people aren't
allowed to be happy?

00:45.473 --> 00:46.930
Well, you're allowed
to be happy,

00:46.930 --> 00:48.764
but not in front of me,
so let's move it down.

00:48.764 --> 00:50.306
- Okay.
- All right.

00:50.306 --> 00:51.680
Good.
Thank you.

00:54.639 --> 00:56.389
Uh, excuse me,
Señor  Larry.

00:56.389 --> 00:59.306
All the lights in here
and in the hallway,
they're all fixed.

00:59.306 --> 01:01.473
You no have no more humming,
no more vibrating.

01:01.473 --> 01:03.722
- Everything is fixed.
- Oh! Cesar, thank you so much.

01:03.722 --> 01:05.847
That was driving me crazy,
that humming.

01:05.847 --> 01:08.056
Anything else
you need from me,
you give me a call

01:08.056 --> 01:09.972
and I'll come here
and fix it right away, okay?

01:09.972 --> 01:11.348
Oh, hey, Cesar.

01:13.680 --> 01:16.764
- That's for you.
- Oh. Oh, no, no, Señor  Larry.
I cannot accept that money.

01:16.764 --> 01:18.473
This is my job.
This is what I do.

01:18.473 --> 01:20.556
It's a little bonus
for you, a little extra.
Take it.

01:20.556 --> 01:23.639
Oh, it means--
it means a lot to me,
Mr. Larry,

01:23.639 --> 01:25.181
but I cannot take this.

01:25.181 --> 01:27.056
I-- I just don't
feel comfortable.

01:27.056 --> 01:29.264
- This is what I do, sir.
- ( scoffs )

01:29.264 --> 01:32.972
Oh, Cesar, this is--
this is unprecedented!

01:32.972 --> 01:36.181
This is rarer than
a man turning down sex,
what you've just done.

01:36.181 --> 01:37.722
It just--
it doesn't happen!

01:37.722 --> 01:39.889
( chuckles )
Okay, Señor  Larry.

01:39.889 --> 01:41.722
I've never turned down
sex in my life.

01:41.722 --> 01:43.431
( chuckles )
Me neither.

01:43.431 --> 01:47.222
Huh! Cesar, this will not
be forgotten anytime soon.

01:47.222 --> 01:49.598
- Have a nice day.
- Very commendable.

01:51.306 --> 01:53.097
Larry:
So now, for some reason,

01:53.097 --> 01:55.556
Funkhouser's gotten back
together with this woman.

01:55.556 --> 01:57.722
- I don't know why.
She hates my guts.
- Aww.

01:57.722 --> 01:59.889
But nevertheless,
he wants to go to brunch

01:59.889 --> 02:03.514
and see if we can
all get along, you know,
so it's gonna be very awkward.

02:03.514 --> 02:05.097
Just because
of the tap water?

02:05.097 --> 02:07.930
- Tap water, yes.
Tap water.
- Wow.

02:07.930 --> 02:09.722
Hey, Eddie, breakfast!

02:09.722 --> 02:10.722
( whispers )
Wow, tap water.

02:10.722 --> 02:11.764
Here you go,
sweetie.

02:11.764 --> 02:13.014
Wow, look at
the young man today!

02:13.014 --> 02:14.722
Very nice hoodie
you got there.

02:14.722 --> 02:16.556
Mom, you're still
dating this guy?

02:16.556 --> 02:19.181
- Yes, honey--
- Yes, and she's
enjoying it very much.

02:19.181 --> 02:21.097
- Take your toast.
- Where's the butter?

02:21.097 --> 02:23.514
It's right there,
quite visible.

02:23.514 --> 02:26.222
I can't see the butter.
Do it again.

02:26.222 --> 02:28.473
( sighs )
He needs to see
the butter.

02:28.473 --> 02:30.930
- I'll eat this one
and I'll make you another one.
- ( sighs )

02:32.680 --> 02:35.680
- Are you two having sex?
- That's Mommy's business.

02:35.680 --> 02:37.972
It's not really your business,
but to tell you the truth,

02:37.972 --> 02:40.264
it's imminent, okay?

02:40.264 --> 02:41.556
Gross.

02:43.639 --> 02:46.014
( sighs )
Sorry, he's really been
having a tough time lately.

02:46.014 --> 02:48.097
I-- I don't know
how you let him get away
with that toast thing.

02:48.097 --> 02:50.722
This kid needs
some structure in his life.
He needs some discipline!

02:50.722 --> 02:52.514
- I know, I know.
- You're not tough enough.

02:52.514 --> 02:55.181
I-- I know.
There's this
private school, and, uh...

02:55.181 --> 02:59.097
I've been thinking about
sending him, but it's really
tough to get into, and...

02:59.097 --> 03:00.556
I wanted to ask you
a question.

03:00.556 --> 03:02.847
Please say no if this
is at all inappropriate,

03:02.847 --> 03:06.181
but Susie happened to mention
this very same school,
Pemberton Academy,

03:06.181 --> 03:07.639
where I'm trying
to get him in.

03:07.639 --> 03:09.639
You had donated
some "Seinfeld" stuff there.

03:09.639 --> 03:12.181
My assistant
takes care of all that.
I just, you know.

03:12.181 --> 03:15.514
- Okay, I just didn't know
if you knew somebody, or...
- Nah, I really don't.

03:15.514 --> 03:18.097
- That's fine, that's fine.
- If I could help, I would,
but I don't know.

03:18.097 --> 03:21.014
You know, I feel
weird about sending him
to boarding school anyway.

03:23.056 --> 03:25.097
- Boarding school?
- Yeah.

03:25.097 --> 03:28.556
- How far away is it?
- It's about an hour
and a half.

03:28.556 --> 03:31.514
I actually think
it would be the best for him,
but it would be hard for me

03:31.514 --> 03:33.306
- just to be rattling around--
- I completely agree with you.

03:33.306 --> 03:35.139
I think it would be
a fantastic thing for him.

03:35.139 --> 03:37.764
- Do you, really?
- It's gotta be the--
you know what?

03:37.764 --> 03:40.805
Get me a name,
get me a number--
whatever I can do to help.

03:40.805 --> 03:41.889
- No.
- Yes!

03:41.889 --> 03:43.889
Give me some information,
done!

03:43.889 --> 03:46.014
That's really nice
of you, Larry.

03:46.014 --> 03:48.598
Thank you so much.
It's gonna be so good for him.

03:48.598 --> 03:53.722
Look, if I can send him
an hour and a half away,
I'm... more than happy to.

03:56.514 --> 03:58.639
- Larry: If I got
those glasses...
- Bridget: Yeah?

03:58.639 --> 04:00.514
We'd be--
we'd be twins.

04:00.514 --> 04:02.556
That would be
kind of hideous,
wouldn't it?

04:02.556 --> 04:05.014
Have you ever seen a couple
with the same glasses?

04:05.014 --> 04:07.431
By the way, when I say couple,
I'm not referring to us
as a couple.

04:07.431 --> 04:10.348
- Yeah, excuse me.
What are you-- hold on.
- No, no, I'm not going there.

04:10.348 --> 04:13.514
We're-- I--
you have not bought me
the same glasses.

04:13.514 --> 04:16.847
We don't have it
like that just yet,
my friend.

04:16.847 --> 04:18.056
- Hi, guys.
- Hi.

04:18.056 --> 04:19.181
Can I bring you some water
while you wait?

04:19.181 --> 04:20.805
Still or sparkling?

04:20.805 --> 04:23.014
- Sparkling. Yeah.
- Yeah, sparkling.

04:23.014 --> 04:25.514
Ugh, boy,
I can't tell you,
I'm so relieved.

04:25.514 --> 04:28.473
Thanks again
for helping me out with
the boarding school thing.

04:28.473 --> 04:30.930
So, before I call
the, um...

04:30.930 --> 04:33.389
- Pemberton.
- Pemberton, yes.
Pemberton.

04:33.389 --> 04:37.722
Do they-- do they know
about the, uh, Asperger's?

04:37.722 --> 04:39.930
Oh, yeah, mm-hmm.
Yeah, they're a great school.

04:39.930 --> 04:44.514
They're-- they can--
they're just equipped to handle
all kinds of special kids.

04:44.514 --> 04:47.056
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.

04:47.056 --> 04:50.473
Has he been diagnosed
by a doctor, or is this
your opinion?

04:50.473 --> 04:54.805
He's on the spectrum.
( chuckles ) Yeah.

04:54.805 --> 04:56.598
How do you know?

04:56.598 --> 05:00.389
You can see in his behavior
and what people have said,
and, you know--

05:00.389 --> 05:02.056
he's, you know--

05:02.056 --> 05:05.847
he's been diagnosed
on the-- on the spectrum.

05:08.930 --> 05:10.056
Okay.

05:10.056 --> 05:11.972
- ( phone ringing )
- Oh.

05:14.222 --> 05:16.181
- Hello?
- Cesar: Señor Larry,

05:16.181 --> 05:18.014
it's Cesar
from the office.

05:18.014 --> 05:19.431
- Who?
- Cesar!

05:19.431 --> 05:21.805
You gave me the tip
and I didn't take it?

05:21.805 --> 05:23.680
Yeah?

05:23.680 --> 05:26.181
I'm here
at the office building,
fixing a leak,

05:26.181 --> 05:28.264
and I was just wondering,
after I'm done,

05:28.264 --> 05:31.764
I could go to your office
and watch the Argentina
and Mexico game.

05:31.764 --> 05:35.014
It's a very important game.
It's for-- to qualify
in the World Cup.

05:35.014 --> 05:37.847
Why-- why--
why do you have to go--
why my office?

05:37.847 --> 05:40.639
Because you got
all the channels, sir.

05:40.639 --> 05:43.972
- Yeah... yeah, okay.
- Gracias, Señor Larry!

05:43.972 --> 05:47.097
I will not forget this.
You are the man.

05:47.097 --> 05:49.014
- Okay.
- Who's that?

05:49.014 --> 05:52.639
- This handyman
in my office building...
- Uh-huh.

05:52.639 --> 05:55.847
...wants to go into my office
to watch a soccer game.

05:55.847 --> 05:57.764
I offered him a tip,
but he didn't take the tip,

05:57.764 --> 06:01.348
so I feel like
I'm a little obligated
to let him watch the game.

06:01.348 --> 06:02.431
It's tricky.

06:02.431 --> 06:04.264
- Hello!
- Oh, hey!

06:04.264 --> 06:05.473
Sorry we're late.

06:05.473 --> 06:06.514
- Hi, I'm Marilyn.
- LD.

06:06.514 --> 06:07.930
- Hi!
- Hi, nice to meet you.

06:07.930 --> 06:09.847
- Yes, hi.
- Hi. Marty Funkhouser.

06:09.847 --> 06:11.639
- Hi, great to meet you.
- Great to meet you!

06:11.639 --> 06:14.514
So, I-- I just wanna say,
before we begin,

06:14.514 --> 06:18.805
I-- I'd like to apologize
for what happened between us.

06:18.805 --> 06:22.181
That is not
a true representation
of who I am.

06:22.181 --> 06:24.097
- Let's start fresh.
- That means a lot to me.
Okay.

06:24.097 --> 06:26.139
- Yes! Yes!
- Yes, let's do it.

06:26.139 --> 06:28.972
Some sparkling water
for the table?

06:28.972 --> 06:32.764
No, no. We-- no,
we don't want that.
We want some tap water.

06:32.764 --> 06:35.014
- You don't want sparkling?
- No, get that out of here.
Tap.

06:35.014 --> 06:36.972
- Well, it's unfiltered.
- Better.

06:36.972 --> 06:38.598
Water is water.
We're not water snobs.

06:38.598 --> 06:40.014
- Server: Very good.
- Larry: We don't care.

06:40.014 --> 06:41.389
While you bring the tap,

06:41.389 --> 06:43.222
bring us the best
bottle of champagne

06:43.222 --> 06:44.847
you have in the house
to drink.

06:44.847 --> 06:46.431
- ( all cheering )
- Okay?

06:46.431 --> 06:47.847
We're gonna live it up!

06:47.847 --> 06:50.722
- ( chuckles )
- Yeah, you know, sure.

06:50.722 --> 06:52.847
Thank you, Larry.
I really appreciate
your apology.

06:52.847 --> 06:54.847
- Larry: Oh, yes.
- No, it means a lot to me.

06:54.847 --> 06:56.264
And some tap water
for the table.

06:56.264 --> 06:57.930
Tap water for the table.
Look at this.

06:57.930 --> 07:00.389
Look at this
beautiful tap water.
We got some here...

07:05.556 --> 07:07.431
- Ah, look at that.
- Mmm.

07:07.431 --> 07:08.930
Ah, it really looks good.

07:08.930 --> 07:11.889
( people chattering )

07:11.889 --> 07:13.598
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
- Oh, come on, buddy.

07:13.598 --> 07:15.097
- There's a line.
- There's a line.

07:15.097 --> 07:16.264
You can't
just walk up here.

07:16.264 --> 07:18.139
Come on, man,
you're being rude.

07:18.139 --> 07:20.722
- They're in line.
- Man: You gotta get
to the back, buddy.

07:20.722 --> 07:23.722
- I'm just
getting some potatoes.
- Woman: I don't care.

07:23.722 --> 07:25.348
One-- one minute!

07:25.348 --> 07:28.431
One minute!
Just a minute!

07:28.431 --> 07:29.764
Are you getting seconds?

07:29.764 --> 07:31.389
Yes, sir.

07:31.389 --> 07:33.056
The man
is getting seconds.

07:33.056 --> 07:35.014
- It doesn't matter.
- But that's not a rule.

07:35.014 --> 07:38.139
The man has already
waited on this line.

07:38.139 --> 07:41.222
- Larry, we're hungry.
- Larry: We're all hungry.

07:41.222 --> 07:42.389
I'm hungry, too!

07:42.389 --> 07:43.847
But to make him wait

07:43.847 --> 07:47.639
another 10 minutes
for a few measly potatoes?

07:47.639 --> 07:49.930
- Shame on you!
Shame on all of you!
- Okay.

07:49.930 --> 07:52.431
That's not how we do things
here in America.

07:52.431 --> 07:56.473
We don't wait for seconds!
Never, never wait for seconds!

07:56.473 --> 07:58.930
- ( whispering )
- It's fine, it's good.
It's fine.

07:58.930 --> 08:02.264
Sir, I would be proud
to serve you.

08:02.264 --> 08:04.473
- What do you want?
- Potatoes.

08:06.556 --> 08:09.056
- Thank you.
Thank you, sir.
- Woman: Sure, sure.

08:09.056 --> 08:11.680
You're welcome.

08:11.680 --> 08:14.764
- It's okay, really.
- I didn't mean to overreact
like that.

08:14.764 --> 08:16.930
- Woman: Enjoy.
- Woman #2: Enjoy yourself.

08:16.930 --> 08:18.431
Thank you.
Thanks.

08:19.598 --> 08:20.889
- ( cork pops )
- Larry: Ah!

08:20.889 --> 08:22.389
- Oh, I love that sound!
- All right!

08:22.389 --> 08:26.097
- You like that?
- I love that sound!

08:26.097 --> 08:29.014
I mean, the good thing here
is that if we want seconds,

08:29.014 --> 08:30.764
- we go right to the front.
- Bridget: Straight to
the front.

08:30.764 --> 08:32.097
- Right?
- Yep.

08:34.222 --> 08:38.556
Boy, oh, boy.
Ha, that's a lot
of ketchup there.

08:38.556 --> 08:40.306
I like ketchup.

08:40.306 --> 08:43.514
Yeah, uh, it seems
a little excessive, no?

08:43.514 --> 08:45.306
- Here we go!
- Living it up!

08:45.306 --> 08:48.389
- Happiness,
living it up! Okay?
- Bridget: Cheers!

08:48.389 --> 08:50.389
I mean, you use
too much ketchup,
you know what happens?

08:50.389 --> 08:52.889
They-- they convert to packs,
to the little packets.

08:52.889 --> 08:55.639
Is there a ketchup shortage?
Like, "Oh, we're gonna
run out of ketchup."

08:55.639 --> 08:57.639
I wasn't saying
there's a ketchup shortage,

08:57.639 --> 09:00.722
it's just that
if everybody uses
as much ketchup as you do,

09:00.722 --> 09:02.056
they would stop buying it.

09:02.056 --> 09:04.473
As a matter of fact,
I think I need more ketchup.

09:04.473 --> 09:05.306
Mmm.

09:07.181 --> 09:09.014
- Bridget: Wow.
- Hmm!

09:09.014 --> 09:10.805
Funkhouser:
Why are we talking
about this?

09:10.805 --> 09:13.473
There's no way she could
finish all that ketchup.
Is there?

09:13.473 --> 09:14.972
Watch me!

09:16.805 --> 09:19.181
Funkhouser:
Let's just change
the subject, okay?

09:19.181 --> 09:20.514
Potatoes are delicious.

09:20.514 --> 09:21.847
- Huh.
- Larry: Yeah.

09:21.847 --> 09:25.181
- Marilyn:
Oh, my God! Oh!
- ( gasps )

09:25.181 --> 09:27.139
- Oh, my God!
- Funkhouser: Don't do that,
don't do that.

09:27.139 --> 09:28.680
Can we get
a wet towel, somebody?

09:28.680 --> 09:30.306
That's okay.
It's okay, it's okay.

09:30.306 --> 09:32.348
It's okay.
Yeah, your sweater
covers it fine.

09:32.348 --> 09:34.847
You know,
I-- I think I want--
I want to go home.

09:34.847 --> 09:36.222
Oh, no!

09:36.222 --> 09:38.056
- It's just
a really bad stain.
- Yeah, go.

09:38.056 --> 09:39.764
- No, Larry,
it's not that bad.
- You got a bad stain.

09:39.764 --> 09:40.930
I'm gonna go home.

09:40.930 --> 09:42.431
I'm just feeling
very uncomfortable.

09:42.431 --> 09:44.348
- Oh, I'm so sorry.
- Yeah, go.

09:44.348 --> 09:46.014
It's a--
it's a really bad stain.

09:46.014 --> 09:48.514
It's a "go home" stain,
you know what I mean?

09:48.514 --> 09:50.348
- It was the fork.
- I think it was the ketchup.

09:50.348 --> 09:52.680
- Let's not argue over this.
- Marilyn: I'm so sorry.

09:52.680 --> 09:55.514
It was lovely to meet you.
You seem lovely.

09:55.514 --> 09:57.598
- Yeah, take her home.
- It's such a shame.

09:57.598 --> 09:59.639
Nice job, once again.

09:59.639 --> 10:02.473
- One of those things.
- Gosh, another time, I guess.

10:02.473 --> 10:04.056
- Bye.
- Bye.

10:04.056 --> 10:06.431
Wow, I feel so bad.

10:06.431 --> 10:08.181
That was
a disgusting display.

10:08.181 --> 10:09.639
You couldn't let
the ketchup go.

10:09.639 --> 10:11.764
- Couldn't let it go.
- Oh, boy.

10:11.764 --> 10:14.639
Guess what.

10:14.639 --> 10:16.972
Who's paying
for the expensive champagne?

10:16.972 --> 10:18.889
- Oh.
- Yeah.

10:24.264 --> 10:27.222
- ( door opens )
- ( footsteps approaching )

10:29.514 --> 10:31.389
I want to thank you

10:31.389 --> 10:34.056
for defending me
in front of the mob.

10:34.056 --> 10:37.056
Oh, oh.
Yes, of course.

10:37.056 --> 10:40.222
That was, uh, terrible.
You had already waited.

10:40.222 --> 10:42.014
What was the point
of going back again?

10:42.014 --> 10:43.930
You would've lost
your appetite.

10:43.930 --> 10:45.930
I agree with you,
Mr. David.

10:48.972 --> 10:50.264
How do you know my name?

10:51.805 --> 10:54.598
I know everything
about you.

10:54.598 --> 10:56.680
I was sitting there
having my brunch,

10:56.680 --> 10:59.431
and I saw you.

10:59.431 --> 11:03.139
And I was thinking,
as a devout Muslim,

11:03.139 --> 11:05.389
I should kill this man.

11:05.389 --> 11:06.722
Fatwa.

11:06.722 --> 11:09.056
And then you defended me.

11:09.056 --> 11:11.431
I thought to myself...

11:13.348 --> 11:15.764
I cannot kill this man.

11:15.764 --> 11:17.889
This man doesn't
deserve to die.

11:17.889 --> 11:20.722
No. No, I don't.
I don't!

11:20.722 --> 11:24.639
I do have some friends
in high positions.

11:24.639 --> 11:27.722
I think I need to bring
to their attention

11:27.722 --> 11:31.097
that you are not the man
they think you are.

11:31.097 --> 11:33.598
Anything you want to know,
I'll give you full access.

11:33.598 --> 11:35.222
I'm an open book.

11:35.222 --> 11:37.014
You will be hearing
from me.

11:37.014 --> 11:39.264
What-- what is your name?

11:39.264 --> 11:43.473
My name
is not important.

11:45.139 --> 11:48.389
- Hey!
- Oh, hey. Um...

11:48.389 --> 11:51.473
- You okay?
- Yeah, I was just
talking to this guy.

11:51.473 --> 11:53.639
( chuckles )
What guy?

11:53.639 --> 11:55.014
Oh.

11:55.014 --> 11:57.473
( chuckles )
Let's go.

11:57.473 --> 11:58.473
Huh.

12:01.639 --> 12:03.348
Larry:
That was a lot of fun.

12:03.348 --> 12:04.930
That horse,
he was so close!

12:04.930 --> 12:06.805
- He should've won!
- I know, I know, I know.

12:06.805 --> 12:09.056
I know.
I was-- I was
excited for you.

12:09.056 --> 12:12.764
By the way,
this is-- what are we on?
10 hours now together?

12:12.764 --> 12:14.598
It's been incredibly fun.

12:14.598 --> 12:16.764
And I can't believe

12:16.764 --> 12:19.014
you made that appointment
at-- at Pemberton.

12:19.014 --> 12:20.473
I'm so grateful.

12:20.473 --> 12:23.348
Believe me, once I get through
with those Pemberton people,

12:23.348 --> 12:25.680
they're gonna beg this kid
to go to that school.

12:25.680 --> 12:27.722
Do-- do you wanna
come in?

12:27.722 --> 12:29.847
- Do I wanna come in?
- Mmm.

12:29.847 --> 12:33.389
Because I'm feeling
pretty grateful.

12:33.389 --> 12:37.014
Are you saying that, uh...

12:37.014 --> 12:40.139
gratitude sex
is in the offing?

12:40.139 --> 12:42.306
If you're okay with
gratitude sex, I mean--

12:42.306 --> 12:44.306
You know what,
I've never had gratitude sex,

12:44.306 --> 12:47.306
mainly because
I've never done anything that
someone could be grateful for.

12:47.306 --> 12:51.264
- ( laughs )
- But people tell me that
gratitude sex is the ultimate.

12:51.264 --> 12:54.056
It's hard to explain.
I'd rather just show you.

12:54.056 --> 12:55.264
- Sure, yeah.
- You know?

12:55.264 --> 12:57.056
( guitar strumming )

12:57.056 --> 13:00.097
Hey, honey.
Uh, I thought
Nancy put you to bed.

13:00.097 --> 13:01.889
She did.

13:01.889 --> 13:05.056
Well, it's time for bed.
It's past your bedtime.

13:05.056 --> 13:07.514
- It's past his bedtime.
- Bridget: Hey, now.

13:07.514 --> 13:09.431
Go to your room, okay?
( sighs )

13:09.431 --> 13:12.930
I'll hang out in my room,
but I'm not going to bed.

13:15.056 --> 13:16.847
I've never seen an old man
in sneakers before.

13:16.847 --> 13:18.680
- Okay, that's--
go to your room.
- ( sarcastic laugh )

13:18.680 --> 13:20.222
That's so stupid.

13:20.222 --> 13:22.805
- Bridget: Eddie! Go.
- Larry: That's a good one.

13:22.805 --> 13:25.306
You know, it's--
he's on the spectrum.
I'm sorry.

13:25.306 --> 13:26.889
- Ah, the spectrum.
- ( door closes )

13:26.889 --> 13:29.598
He's on the spectrum.
Yeah.

13:29.598 --> 13:32.264
- ( deeply inhales )
- ( guitar strumming )

13:32.264 --> 13:34.264
Guess that's that.

13:34.264 --> 13:36.473
He won't listen
to me, but...

13:36.473 --> 13:40.431
maybe you can--
you can get him to bed.

13:40.431 --> 13:41.889
The offer still stands.

13:41.889 --> 13:43.889
( guitar strumming
continues )

13:45.805 --> 13:47.639
( chuckles )
Yeah!

13:49.680 --> 13:52.431
( guitar strumming )

14:01.181 --> 14:03.514
All right,
you little prick, okay?

14:03.514 --> 14:06.431
I got some gratitude sex
coming to me, and you're
not gonna ruin it.

14:06.431 --> 14:07.847
You got it?

14:07.847 --> 14:08.930
Now get under those covers.

14:08.930 --> 14:10.389
You're gonna go to sleep,

14:10.389 --> 14:12.097
and I'm gonna have sex
with your mother.

14:19.431 --> 14:20.805
Hello.

14:20.805 --> 14:23.805
You're looking at a man
with an "A" on his shirt...

14:23.805 --> 14:24.930
for "apology."

14:24.930 --> 14:26.556
- Is that so?
- Yes.

14:26.556 --> 14:28.222
I'm sorry
for the other day.

14:28.222 --> 14:29.805
There was nothing
I could do.

14:29.805 --> 14:31.764
We had to leave,
so I left.

14:31.764 --> 14:34.181
( scoffs )
Quite an expensive
bottle of champagne

14:34.181 --> 14:35.431
I wound up paying for.

14:35.431 --> 14:36.764
We ordered
the champagne

14:36.764 --> 14:38.639
because you wanted
to live it up.

14:38.639 --> 14:41.139
You  said,
"Let's live it up."
I would never live it up.

14:41.139 --> 14:42.639
I live it down,
I don't live it up.

14:42.639 --> 14:44.556
Okay, maybe I said,
"Let's live it up."

14:44.556 --> 14:46.639
- You did.
- I wanted to have
a good time, that's all!

14:46.639 --> 14:48.889
So anyway,
so you're here to what?

14:48.889 --> 14:51.014
Apologize.
I'm sorry!

14:51.014 --> 14:52.805
For leaving me
with the bill?

14:52.805 --> 14:56.014
No, I'm sorry
for leaving early.

14:56.014 --> 14:57.556
That's what
I'm sorry about.

14:57.556 --> 14:59.473
I don't mind
you leaving early,

14:59.473 --> 15:03.847
but I think the proper apology
would be to say, "I'm sorry.

15:03.847 --> 15:06.014
Here's $250
for the champagne."

15:06.014 --> 15:08.514
- Okay?
- That's a cash apology.

15:08.514 --> 15:10.139
My apology
is from the heart.

15:10.139 --> 15:12.014
That's something
that means something.

15:12.014 --> 15:14.014
Why do you come
to the office to apologize
without offering the money?

15:14.014 --> 15:15.306
Because I felt bad!

15:15.306 --> 15:17.431
If you feel bad,
you offer the money!

15:17.431 --> 15:19.348
- No, you don't!
- You don't understand
feeling bad!

15:19.348 --> 15:21.639
Feeling bad
is feeling in the heart,
not in the wallet!

15:21.639 --> 15:24.680
- No, feeling bad
is making it up!
- It is not!

15:24.680 --> 15:29.056
Well, to come here
and apologize without
taking your wallet out

15:29.056 --> 15:32.306
and offering, who knows
if I would even accept it?

15:32.306 --> 15:34.680
There's not even an offer!

15:34.680 --> 15:36.222
Let's go to lunch,
talk it over.

15:36.222 --> 15:37.930
- Okay. Yeah.
- Okay?

15:37.930 --> 15:40.514
I gotta take
a quick piss.

15:40.514 --> 15:42.805
- Mr. Larry.
- Ah, Cesar.

15:42.805 --> 15:46.056
I want to thank you
for offering me to watch
the game on your TV.

15:46.056 --> 15:47.889
Ah, well,
you're very welcome.

15:47.889 --> 15:50.639
- But unfortunately,
I couldn't make it.
- What?

15:50.639 --> 15:53.889
Yeah, my wife,
she wanted me to do a bunch
of chores in the house,

15:53.889 --> 15:55.431
so I-- I couldn't come.

15:55.431 --> 15:58.056
I'm, uh-- well,
I'm sorry to hear that.
Too bad.

15:58.056 --> 16:03.014
But, uh, you-- you're a member
of a nice country club, sí?

16:03.014 --> 16:06.097
- Yeah?
- Can I bring my family there
for a nice little swim?

16:06.097 --> 16:08.056
Little Cesar's like Aquaman.

16:08.056 --> 16:12.014
No. No, you can't-- you can't
bring your family there, no!

16:12.014 --> 16:14.764
- But-- but why not?
- It's not the way
it works. No!

16:14.764 --> 16:16.764
I don't understand
your lack of generosity.

16:16.764 --> 16:18.473
Lack of generosity?
What are you talking about?

16:18.473 --> 16:20.556
I gave you a tip,
which you turned down.

16:20.556 --> 16:22.348
I did not take it,
so you owe me a favor.

16:22.348 --> 16:25.764
I already repaid you a favor
that I didn't even owe you!

16:25.764 --> 16:29.264
The whole point of the tip
is for you to be indebted to me.

16:29.264 --> 16:31.181
Now you've--
you've reversed it!

16:31.181 --> 16:32.306
Now I'm indebted to you.

16:32.306 --> 16:33.972
You flipped it!
You flipped the tip!

16:33.972 --> 16:35.306
I promised
Little Cesar.

16:37.014 --> 16:39.056
All right.
This is the last one.

16:39.056 --> 16:40.930
Okay? This is it.

16:40.930 --> 16:43.431
And next time I give you
a tip, you take it, okay?

16:43.431 --> 16:46.097
- Okay, Mr. Larry.
- But the country club
is out.

16:46.097 --> 16:47.514
You can't swim there.
They're racist.

16:47.514 --> 16:48.764
They're not gonna
let you in there.

16:48.764 --> 16:50.598
Why are you a member
of a racist club?

16:50.598 --> 16:52.930
They're all racists.
That's the way they operate.

16:52.930 --> 16:54.431
How about your pool?

16:54.431 --> 16:56.805
Oh, I would,
but the heater in my house

16:56.805 --> 16:59.972
got all screwed up
and nothing's working now,
and the pool's not working.

16:59.972 --> 17:02.181
I bet you have friends
with nice pools.

17:04.014 --> 17:06.348
Hey...

17:06.348 --> 17:07.930
your pool working?

17:07.930 --> 17:08.972
Yeah.

17:08.972 --> 17:11.805
Can Cesar and his family
use your pool?

17:11.805 --> 17:14.181
- Who's Cesar?
- Yo.

17:14.181 --> 17:15.680
Nice to meet you, Cesar.

17:15.680 --> 17:17.181
Nice to meet you, sir.

17:17.181 --> 17:18.598
Can he use my pool?

17:18.598 --> 17:21.014
It's hot out, they have
no place to swim, and...

17:21.014 --> 17:23.639
At this time of year,

17:23.639 --> 17:25.431
we might have
family coming over.

17:25.431 --> 17:28.348
- You know,
I never know--
- I'll tell you what.

17:28.348 --> 17:31.014
We call it even,
the $250.

17:31.014 --> 17:34.306
- So you're never gonna
mention it again?
- Never again.

17:34.306 --> 17:36.514
- When do you want
to come over?
- On Saturday.

17:36.514 --> 17:38.473
Cesar:
What time is good for you?
8:00 a.m.?

17:38.473 --> 17:41.014
- Funkhouser:
Uh, let's make it 8:30.
- Thank you, sir.

17:41.014 --> 17:42.514
- Hey, do me a favor.
- Yes, sir.

17:42.514 --> 17:45.514
No diving, and try to stay
in the shallow end, okay?

17:45.514 --> 17:47.972
- That's his number.
- Oh, thank you,
Mr. Larry.

17:47.972 --> 17:50.847
( chuckles )
Little Cesar
is gonna be so happy.

17:50.847 --> 17:52.306
Gracias.

17:55.056 --> 17:57.680
Larry David paid you
for your services?

17:57.680 --> 17:59.264
Hell, yeah, he did.

17:59.264 --> 18:01.556
But all he did was use me
to get in the carpool lane

18:01.556 --> 18:03.680
so he can get
to the Dodger game.

18:03.680 --> 18:08.348
So you're saying that,
uh, your encounter was
not of sexual nature.

18:08.348 --> 18:10.222
Hell, no!

18:10.222 --> 18:12.181
He could've had all this!

18:15.014 --> 18:16.972
I still don't
understand.

18:16.972 --> 18:20.389
How can your father
be a kamikaze pilot
when he's still alive?

18:20.389 --> 18:24.056
He grazed the ship.

18:24.056 --> 18:26.014
Grazed, but not fatal.

18:26.014 --> 18:27.930
( sighs )

18:27.930 --> 18:29.014
No.

18:29.014 --> 18:31.889
Then Larry was right.

18:31.889 --> 18:34.222
So, Larry David
went on a date with you

18:34.222 --> 18:35.722
and carried you upstairs?

18:35.722 --> 18:37.889
Yeah.
I didn't want him to.

18:37.889 --> 18:40.473
- Oh, he insisted?
- Yes.

18:40.473 --> 18:43.556
You know,
I wasn't the only girl
in a wheelchair he was dating.

18:43.556 --> 18:47.389
So, he went out
with two different women
with disability?

18:47.389 --> 18:49.222
At least.

18:49.222 --> 18:50.764
Commendable.

18:52.722 --> 18:54.431
I'd see Larry
occasionally.

18:54.431 --> 18:58.014
I guess you would say
I had some issues with him.

18:58.014 --> 19:00.764
But wasn't the real issue

19:00.764 --> 19:04.431
the... big vagina?

19:05.639 --> 19:07.930
Yes. It's big.

19:07.930 --> 19:10.056
Big enough to steal

19:10.056 --> 19:13.598
a Mickey Mantle
autographed baseball?

19:15.014 --> 19:16.598
- Yes.
- Hmm.

19:16.598 --> 19:21.056
He took a word
in one of my rhymes
and changed that shit.

19:21.056 --> 19:23.764
And it opened up
lyrically for me.

19:23.764 --> 19:25.097
It was amazing, man.

19:25.097 --> 19:28.930
He also saved me from
a marriage to a lesbian.

19:28.930 --> 19:30.722
So, yeah...

19:30.722 --> 19:33.389
that motherfucker's
my Caucasian.

19:33.389 --> 19:35.348
- Caucasian?
- Write that shit down.

19:35.348 --> 19:37.680
- He is your Caucasian, yes.
- He is my Caucasian.

19:37.680 --> 19:39.264
And a motherfucker.

19:39.264 --> 19:41.264
So, we're on the ski lift
and it's shkiyat hachamah.

19:41.264 --> 19:42.847
And according
to Jewish law,

19:42.847 --> 19:45.722
I'm not allowed
to be with a man
alone after sundown,

19:45.722 --> 19:47.139
so I asked him to jump.

19:47.139 --> 19:49.348
And he refused,
so I had to jump.

19:49.348 --> 19:52.930
So he refused
to follow the tenets
of Jewish orthodoxy.

19:52.930 --> 19:54.805
Oh, absolutely.

19:54.805 --> 19:56.181
Big time.

19:58.097 --> 19:59.764
Please continue.

19:59.764 --> 20:04.014
( stuttering )
So, he comes upstairs
and he accuses me of clomping.

20:04.014 --> 20:05.722
And I explained to him,
I have these shoes,

20:05.722 --> 20:08.639
these heavy shoes that I wear
because my feet get cramped.

20:08.639 --> 20:10.473
And they make noise.

20:10.473 --> 20:12.014
I invite him in.

20:12.014 --> 20:15.056
I offer him a soda.

20:15.056 --> 20:17.805
He took it, and it exploded,
and it got all over him,

20:17.805 --> 20:20.139
and he got... upset.

20:20.139 --> 20:22.805
- Now it's-- now it's--
- Mr. Fox...

20:22.805 --> 20:24.680
did you clomp on purpose?

20:26.556 --> 20:27.930
A little bit.

20:27.930 --> 20:31.805
And did you embellish
the shaking of the soda?

20:34.139 --> 20:35.889
Yeah.

20:35.889 --> 20:37.680
Thank you.

20:37.680 --> 20:41.222
May I offer you
some refreshment?

20:41.222 --> 20:43.514
No, thank you.

20:43.514 --> 20:45.181
I pass, sir.

20:45.181 --> 20:46.847
Pussy.

20:48.847 --> 20:51.348
( chatter )

20:56.556 --> 21:00.222
Larry, thank you for
all of the "Seinfeld" scripts

21:00.222 --> 21:02.889
and memorabilia
that you've donated
to our fundraisers.

21:02.889 --> 21:04.181
- It's really--
- Yes.

21:04.181 --> 21:05.431
It's made a lot of money
for the school.

21:05.431 --> 21:06.805
So happy to do it.

21:06.805 --> 21:09.348
And thank for allowing me
to come in here today

21:09.348 --> 21:14.306
and talk to you, uh,
about this young man
who I adore.

21:14.306 --> 21:15.805
- Yes, Eddie.
- Uh, Eddie, yes.

21:15.805 --> 21:17.222
- Right.
- Eddie, yes.

21:17.222 --> 21:19.139
You know what?

21:19.139 --> 21:22.722
I just feel like
I'm ignoring you
all the way on that side.

21:22.722 --> 21:26.680
I should be here
because sometimes women,
they're a little, uh,

21:26.680 --> 21:29.889
ultra-sensitive about being
ignored at these meetings.

21:29.889 --> 21:31.805
"Oh, oh, you don't talk
to the woman," you know.

21:31.805 --> 21:33.722
- Oh, no.
- That's not me.
That's not me.

21:33.722 --> 21:36.514
Wherever you want
to sit is fine.
Please.

21:36.514 --> 21:39.348
Okay, thank you.
Thank you.

21:39.348 --> 21:42.181
I actually would prefer
to sit over there,
but, you know.

21:42.181 --> 21:43.889
- Well, please!
- Feel free, Larry.

21:43.889 --> 21:45.930
Okay, all right, okay.
Thank you.

21:45.930 --> 21:47.722
- All right, so!
- Eddie.

21:47.722 --> 21:50.514
You know, I-- I love this kid
like-- like my own son.

21:50.514 --> 21:53.847
- Mm-hmm.
- Well, you know,
like a nephew.

21:53.847 --> 21:55.264
Actually, more like
a foster child

21:55.264 --> 21:57.722
who comes to your house,
and all of a sudden, you go,

21:57.722 --> 22:00.431
"What the hell did I do?
I got-- what am I, nuts?"

22:00.431 --> 22:03.431
But, no, no, you grow--
you grow to love them.

22:03.431 --> 22:04.764
That's how I feel now.

22:04.764 --> 22:06.264
It's-- uh, so...

22:06.264 --> 22:11.097
Bridget is Eddie's mother,
and she's your girlfriend?

22:11.097 --> 22:12.598
Larry:
Girlfriend...

22:12.598 --> 22:16.722
I don't know, but she does
have tampons in my house.

22:16.722 --> 22:18.764
Okay, Mr. David,
we just want

22:18.764 --> 22:21.431
to get to the nature
of your relationship
because--

22:21.431 --> 22:24.431
- Man: We were happy to do
a favor for you, Larry.
- Sure.

22:24.431 --> 22:27.764
- But--
- We just wanna make sure
that it's just not a fling.

22:27.764 --> 22:31.889
We're just interested
in where you see this
relationship going.

22:31.889 --> 22:33.930
Yeah, the relationship going.
I don't know.

22:33.930 --> 22:35.431
You know,
they're kind of tough.

22:35.431 --> 22:38.139
You get
involved with somebody,
and all of a sudden,

22:38.139 --> 22:40.431
you got to check in,
you got to report in,

22:40.431 --> 22:42.722
you got to text them,
make those phone calls.

22:42.722 --> 22:45.348
You go away for
a weekend with your friends
on a trip to Vegas,

22:45.348 --> 22:46.847
you come back, she says,
"Did you had fun?"

22:46.847 --> 22:48.764
You got to lie, say,
"No, no, I didn't have fun.

22:48.764 --> 22:51.097
"No, no, it wasn't fun at all.
Worst trip I ever made
in my life."

22:51.097 --> 22:54.181
Then she talks to one
of your friends and they say
they had a fantastic time.

22:54.181 --> 22:56.847
She comes back to me,
she says, "Your friends
said you had a great time."

22:56.847 --> 23:00.348
And you go, "No, no,
they had a great time.
I had a lousy time."

23:00.348 --> 23:01.680
( scoffs )

23:01.680 --> 23:03.139
Uh...

23:03.139 --> 23:07.680
in general, how are you
with commitments,
relationships?

23:07.680 --> 23:10.056
I can't sleep
with the same bed
with anybody.

23:10.056 --> 23:12.014
It's, ugh,
a horrible night's sleep.

23:12.014 --> 23:15.181
You can't-- you--
I'm off in a corner like this.

23:15.181 --> 23:18.722
You know, 'cause I don't
want another body touching mine
when I'm trying to fall asleep.

23:18.722 --> 23:21.722
And you can't turn this way
because then you get--
you got face-to-face.

23:21.722 --> 23:23.473
You don't wanna do that
in the middle of the night.

23:23.473 --> 23:26.514
Well, where-- where do you see
the relationship going?

23:26.514 --> 23:28.639
I see it going,
hopefully, one day,

23:28.639 --> 23:30.680
to the point
where I'll let her
sleep in the guestroom.

23:30.680 --> 23:32.847
I'm-- I'm shooting
for that.

23:32.847 --> 23:36.014
Uh, we just want to make sure
that Eddie is coming for
the right reasons.

23:36.014 --> 23:37.598
Yes.
Oh, well, yes.

23:37.598 --> 23:41.264
And that
you're in a long-term,
committed relationship.

23:41.264 --> 23:44.097
Well, I can--
I can give you nine months.

23:44.097 --> 23:46.014
Um, that's...

23:46.014 --> 23:49.680
Well, no, I can give you--
I can give you nine months.

23:49.680 --> 23:51.222
Nine happy months.

23:51.222 --> 23:54.389
Then I can give you
years and years of--
of being miserable.

23:54.389 --> 23:55.972
But we'll be together!

23:55.972 --> 23:57.431
Well, that's actually

23:57.431 --> 23:59.389
really what we're
looking to hear, Larry,

23:59.389 --> 24:00.598
is that you are
gonna be together

24:00.598 --> 24:02.431
for an extended
amount of time.

24:02.431 --> 24:04.473
- Absolutely.
- At least while Eddie
is here at school.

24:04.473 --> 24:07.722
Unless she gets
sick or something,
in which case I'll--

24:07.722 --> 24:09.556
I'll leave her quickly.
You could understand that.

24:09.556 --> 24:11.473
I'm not gonna visit people
in the hospital.

24:11.473 --> 24:13.389
I'm-- I'm not crazy,
you know.

24:13.389 --> 24:14.889
Otherwise...

24:14.889 --> 24:17.556
- I adore this woman.
- ( phone ringing )

24:17.556 --> 24:18.847
Excuse me.

24:18.847 --> 24:20.680
Hello.

24:20.680 --> 24:23.264
- LD, it's the Funk-Man.
- Hey, I can't talk right now.

24:23.264 --> 24:26.556
All right, I'll make it quick.
I can't host Cesar's pool party.

24:26.556 --> 24:29.139
- What? Why?
- Well, Marilyn wants us

24:29.139 --> 24:31.556
to go to Catalina,
so I've got to do it.

24:31.556 --> 24:35.181
I'm very disappointed.
And I'm sure Cesar
will be, too.

24:35.181 --> 24:39.264
- And Little Cesar.
- I don't know Little Cesar
and I don't really know Cesar.

24:39.264 --> 24:41.598
But, uh, we still on
for brunch Sunday?

24:41.598 --> 24:42.680
Uh, I guess so.

24:42.680 --> 24:43.930
Okay, I'll see you then.

24:43.930 --> 24:46.097
All right.
Goodbye.

24:46.097 --> 24:50.598
So, uh, Larry, again,
we're very happy you came in,
talked to us about Eddie.

24:50.598 --> 24:53.598
I think things, um--
I think look pretty good.

24:53.598 --> 24:54.930
We're very, uh...

24:56.473 --> 24:58.431
Could my handyman
and his family

24:58.431 --> 25:00.598
use your pool
on Saturday?

25:06.598 --> 25:09.056
( whispering,
chuckling )

25:14.473 --> 25:16.348
- Hi.
- Hey.

25:16.348 --> 25:17.805
- Same table.
- Is it?

25:17.805 --> 25:19.972
- Champagne.
- Oh.

25:19.972 --> 25:22.014
- This time we'll drink it.
- ( nervous chuckling )

25:22.014 --> 25:23.722
- What's the matter?
- ( stammering )

25:23.722 --> 25:27.473
I just got off the phone
with the Pemberton Academy.

25:27.473 --> 25:28.805
What'd they say?

25:28.805 --> 25:30.014
Eddie didn't get in.

25:30.014 --> 25:31.473
- He didn't get in?
- No.

25:31.473 --> 25:32.889
Why?

25:32.889 --> 25:34.306
Because
of the condition

25:34.306 --> 25:36.722
that your handyman
and his family

25:36.722 --> 25:38.930
left the Pemberton Academy
pool.

25:38.930 --> 25:40.473
What?
What's the condition?

25:40.473 --> 25:42.014
Befouled.

25:42.014 --> 25:44.264
Little Cesar
befouled the pool?

25:44.264 --> 25:45.306
Why would you
send them there?

25:45.306 --> 25:46.972
Of all the pools
in California?

25:46.972 --> 25:48.972
I don't know,
'cause Little Cesar
wanted to use a pool!

25:48.972 --> 25:50.639
I couldn't-- I couldn't
refuse Little Cesar.

25:50.639 --> 25:52.264
Why do they have
to use a pool at all?

25:52.264 --> 25:54.222
Cesar flipped
the tip on me
and, you know,

25:54.222 --> 25:55.972
he wouldn't take the tip,
so I was obligated to!

25:55.972 --> 25:57.181
- Hi!
- Hello!

25:57.181 --> 25:59.139
More obligated
than to-- hi!

25:59.139 --> 26:01.222
- Hi.
- How are you?

26:01.222 --> 26:02.889
What a day!

26:02.889 --> 26:04.680
We just came back
from Catalina.

26:04.680 --> 26:07.431
- Oh, heard that's beautiful.
- What a cruise!

26:07.431 --> 26:09.306
- Dolphins!
- Great boat, beautiful.

26:09.306 --> 26:10.847
- Magnificent.
- I think I got too much sun.

26:10.847 --> 26:12.222
Funkhouser:
How are you guys doing?

26:12.222 --> 26:16.264
Gosh, I am so sorry,
but I think I have to go.

26:16.264 --> 26:19.639
- Oh, no.
- We just had a "go home"
argument, and I have to go.

26:19.639 --> 26:22.764
Oh, no, no, no.
Don't do that!
No, don't do that!

26:22.764 --> 26:25.473
I just feel so upset.
I'm not gonna be able
to rally for today.

26:25.473 --> 26:27.014
- Yeah.
- Thank you.
You understand.

26:27.014 --> 26:28.847
- Thanks for trying.
- Oh, no. I'm sorry, no.

26:28.847 --> 26:31.181
I'll see you,
maybe, again,
but who can say?

26:31.181 --> 26:34.680
- I might not.
- No, I'm so-- ah!
Ah, I'm sorry!

26:34.680 --> 26:36.389
Enjoy the champagne.

26:36.389 --> 26:39.097
- I'm sorry! Ah!
- Here we go.

26:39.097 --> 26:40.389
( cork pops )

26:44.056 --> 26:45.556
( tires screech )

26:47.598 --> 26:49.181
Oh!

26:55.556 --> 26:58.514
Mr. David, get in.

26:58.514 --> 27:01.348
Get-- get in the car?
What, where-- where
are we going?

27:01.348 --> 27:03.889
I haven't even
had-- had brunch yet.

27:03.889 --> 27:05.348
Get in.

27:05.348 --> 27:06.722
Okay.

27:08.222 --> 27:10.264
Oh, my God.

27:10.264 --> 27:11.181
Go.

27:14.722 --> 27:17.639
Morsi:
There was no reason for me
to get to the back of the line.

27:17.639 --> 27:19.972
As I said,
I had already waited,

27:19.972 --> 27:26.181
and those brunch buffet lines
are interminable.

27:26.181 --> 27:28.389
Yes, I am familiar

27:28.389 --> 27:30.764
because
they cook the eggs
while you wait.

27:30.764 --> 27:32.181
( muftis agree )

27:32.181 --> 27:36.097
And all I wanted--
just a little bit more
home fries.

27:36.097 --> 27:37.680
Ah, yes, home fries.

27:37.680 --> 27:39.764
A nice compliment
to the eggs.

27:39.764 --> 27:41.431
With ketchup?

27:41.431 --> 27:43.181
( chuckles )
Yes, of course.

27:43.181 --> 27:46.847
( chattering in Arabic )

27:46.847 --> 27:50.181
So it seems wrong to wait
15 minutes just for that.

27:50.181 --> 27:52.473
Yes, of course.
Why even get them?

27:52.473 --> 27:55.722
Exactly.
So I took a chance.

27:55.722 --> 27:57.097
But the outcry

27:57.097 --> 28:00.431
was unlike anything
you could ever imagine.

28:00.431 --> 28:02.473
You are perceived
as a cutter.

28:02.473 --> 28:05.222
There's nothing Americans
hate more than a cutter.

28:05.222 --> 28:06.473
- He is right.
- It's true.

28:06.473 --> 28:10.556
You're right, Mufti.
I was humiliated.

28:10.556 --> 28:12.722
But this man...

28:12.722 --> 28:14.805
he rose
to my defense.

28:14.805 --> 28:17.431
He said I have
every right

28:17.431 --> 28:20.222
to get seconds
without waiting.

28:20.222 --> 28:22.930
He was forceful,
passionate,

28:22.930 --> 28:25.389
and courageous.

28:25.389 --> 28:28.639
When the American
blood sugar gets low,

28:28.639 --> 28:30.598
they turn into animals.

28:30.598 --> 28:32.097
It's very intimidating.

28:32.097 --> 28:33.764
- True.
- I have seen it.

28:33.764 --> 28:36.014
Morsi:
Not this man.

28:36.014 --> 28:37.639
It was something to see.

28:37.639 --> 28:41.222
And that's why
I come before you

28:41.222 --> 28:45.556
to beg you
to reevaluate his case.

28:45.556 --> 28:49.972
I have read the report
of your investigation
with great interest.

28:49.972 --> 28:53.014
However, there are
many things in his past

28:53.014 --> 28:55.930
which contradict his behavior
in the restaurant.

28:55.930 --> 29:01.598
For example,
this business about not
giving out candy on Halloween.

29:01.598 --> 29:03.847
Surely that cannot
be justified.

29:03.847 --> 29:07.805
With all due respect,
he did give out candies.

29:07.805 --> 29:11.181
But the girls in question,
they were teenagers.

29:11.181 --> 29:13.014
Much too old
to be tricking.

29:13.014 --> 29:15.514
Tricking or treating?

29:15.514 --> 29:17.764
This is all
so very confusing.

29:17.764 --> 29:19.598
Well, you play tricks

29:19.598 --> 29:22.598
if you don't get the treat,
is my understanding.

29:22.598 --> 29:25.264
- ( muftis murmuring )
- Yes, I believe
that is correct.

29:25.264 --> 29:26.972
That is confusing.

29:26.972 --> 29:28.514
But the girls
were 16.

29:28.514 --> 29:31.722
You don't trick
when you're 16.

29:31.722 --> 29:35.222
That's not tricking,
that's stealing.

29:35.222 --> 29:37.181
By denying
them candy,

29:37.181 --> 29:39.722
he was teaching them
a lesson.

29:39.722 --> 29:41.680
- ( muftis agreeing )
- Yes.

29:41.680 --> 29:44.389
- ( all murmuring )
- I see your point.

29:44.389 --> 29:46.930
Ah, very good.
Very good.

29:46.930 --> 29:49.556
- ( speaking Arabic )
- Pass the plates, gentlemen.

29:49.556 --> 29:52.722
- Falafel. Yes, falafel.
- Mufti #2: Another falafel
over here.

29:52.722 --> 29:54.056
- Kabob.
- Kabob for me.

29:54.056 --> 29:57.348
- Onion rings. Yes.
- Ah, french fries.

29:57.348 --> 30:01.722
Mufti:
But what about
his values?

30:01.722 --> 30:03.722
His lust knows no bounds.

30:03.722 --> 30:07.348
He will have
sexual congress
with anyone, anytime.

30:07.348 --> 30:09.930
Including a Palestinian.

30:09.930 --> 30:12.389
- ( muftis murmuring )
- What? Is this true?

30:12.389 --> 30:14.181
This is so?

30:14.181 --> 30:15.972
You know this
for a fact?

30:15.972 --> 30:17.473
Twice.

30:17.473 --> 30:18.722
- Twice!
- ( muftis murmuring )

30:18.722 --> 30:20.181
A Muslim woman?

30:20.181 --> 30:21.264
Morsi:
Yes, Mufti,

30:21.264 --> 30:22.556
she is a Muslim.

30:22.556 --> 30:24.431
( murmuring )

30:24.431 --> 30:26.722
Mufti:
Very interesting.

30:26.722 --> 30:29.431
This is new information.

30:29.431 --> 30:32.306
I will personally
contact the ayatollah

30:32.306 --> 30:35.139
and let him know
what we have learned.

30:36.598 --> 30:39.097
I can say
without reservation

30:39.097 --> 30:42.389
that he will rescind
the fatwa.

30:42.389 --> 30:46.930
- You are free to go.
- Thank you, "Moofti"!
"Muff-ti"!

30:46.930 --> 30:48.805
Thank you all,
moo-mooftis and muff-tis.

30:48.805 --> 30:50.306
Is it "muff-ti"
or "moofti"?

30:50.306 --> 30:51.473
"Moofti."

30:51.473 --> 30:53.181
- "Moovti."
- "Moovti."

30:53.181 --> 30:54.556
Thank you, "Moovtis."

30:54.556 --> 30:57.097
Thank you so--
but what about the musical?

30:57.097 --> 30:58.930
Um, the musical
"Fatwa!"?

30:58.930 --> 31:01.930
I will say this
about the musical...

31:03.431 --> 31:05.847
If you can get
Lin-Manuel Miranda,

31:05.847 --> 31:07.473
you know,
from "Hamilton"...

31:07.473 --> 31:10.222
- ( muftis agreeing )
- Yes! I love "Hamilton"!

31:10.222 --> 31:13.056
If you can get
Lin-Manuel Miranda to star,

31:13.056 --> 31:14.598
you can proceed
with the musical.

31:14.598 --> 31:15.889
( stammering )
How am I gonna
get Lin-Manuel?

31:15.889 --> 31:17.680
He-- he's got
his own stuff he does.

31:17.680 --> 31:19.139
- He's not gonna be in this.
- ( bottle squirting )

31:19.139 --> 31:20.972
What are you doing
with the ketchup?

31:20.972 --> 31:22.556
You used up
all the ketchup!

31:22.556 --> 31:25.514
- I like ketchup.
- Show some restraint.

31:25.514 --> 31:27.847
You're never going
to eat all that.

31:27.847 --> 31:30.805
Is there a shortage of ketchup
that I was not aware of?

31:30.805 --> 31:34.972
This is why I have been
advocating for packets,
but no one will listen!

31:34.972 --> 31:39.014
- Now, that's a good idea.
- I cannot eat onion rings
without ketchup.

31:39.014 --> 31:40.930
The whole snack is ruined!

31:40.930 --> 31:43.556
- Wait, don't go!
- Please, no!

31:43.556 --> 31:45.264
How am I gonna get
Lin-Manuel?

31:45.264 --> 31:48.139
- Mufti #3:
You're being a baby.
- ( chattering )

31:48.139 --> 31:49.556
Thank you.

32:01.639 --> 32:03.014
Huh. Okay.

32:03.014 --> 32:06.014
- Driver: Here you are.
- All right. Very nice.

32:06.014 --> 32:08.097
- All right.
- Thank you so much
for everything.

32:08.097 --> 32:10.348
I really appreciate it.
Let me, uh-- before you go.

32:10.348 --> 32:11.972
No, I can't take that.

32:11.972 --> 32:13.348
- Oh, no.
- Please, put it back.

32:13.348 --> 32:14.847
- I insist.
- No, I cannot take this.

32:14.847 --> 32:16.722
- What? Come on, please.
- I cannot take it.

32:16.722 --> 32:18.722
- Take the money. What?
- No. You are going
to embar--

32:18.722 --> 32:20.222
- You are offending me.
- You're offending me!

32:20.222 --> 32:22.222
( arguing )

32:22.222 --> 32:23.972
- I'm not taking--
- Look. Yeah, take it.

32:23.972 --> 32:26.389
- I don't want it. Yeah.
- No! Take it back!

32:26.389 --> 32:27.722
I don't want it!

32:27.722 --> 32:29.889
I can't take that
from you, sir!

32:29.889 --> 32:31.473
I will not take
this tip, okay?

32:31.473 --> 32:32.598
Take the money!

32:32.598 --> 32:34.514
You ain't gonna
flip a tip on me!

-SUSIE GREENE: It is?
-We're having a meeting

33:51.514 --> 33:53.514
with Lin-Manuel Miranda
this week.

33:54.639 --> 33:55.972
You better get rid
of the do-rag.

33:55.972 --> 33:57.473
It's in the same family
as a scarf,

33:57.473 --> 33:59.056
as a ascot,
as a pocket square.

33:59.056 --> 34:01.722
I don't think that's
in the scarf-ascot-
pocket square family.

34:01.722 --> 34:03.805
-Man, this is cool.
-I love it.

34:03.805 --> 34:05.639
I have to keep the hat
on during sex.

34:05.639 --> 34:07.139
She's got a thing for cowboys.

34:07.139 --> 34:08.972
Where are the women
who have a bald perversion?
