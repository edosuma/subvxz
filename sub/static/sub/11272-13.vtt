WEBVTT

00:07.001 --> 00:09.156
OK, folks.

00:09.333 --> 00:14.073
Just to help you pass time
while you're waiting for a table upstairs,

00:14.249 --> 00:19.616
l will show you a trick that leaves
people with their mouths wide open.

00:19.789 --> 00:24.530
l'm going to guess your age
by asking three simple questions. OK?

00:25.622 --> 00:27.826
- Sounds like fun.
- Good.

00:27.997 --> 00:32.320
OK, first question.
What year were you born?

00:34.579 --> 00:38.193
- You're kidding?
- Bare with me, will you?

00:40.078 --> 00:42.448
1 949.

00:43.744 --> 00:47.488
OK, second question.
How much do you weigh?

00:49.369 --> 00:52.035
About 1 85 pounds.

00:54.868 --> 00:59.110
OK, third and last question.
What do you do for a living?

00:59.284 --> 01:02.779
l'm a carpet salesman.

01:04.575 --> 01:09.112
OK, l should have an answer for you
right after dinner.

01:10.989 --> 01:14.935
- After dinner?
- Yeah, l forgot to carry a number.

01:16.031 --> 01:18.021
Four, six and seven...

01:20.000 --> 01:26.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:33.393 --> 02:36.307
- Afternoon, everybody.
- Norm!

02:36.476 --> 02:40.256
- What would you like?
- Got anything pale and cold?

02:40.434 --> 02:43.716
Yeah, but it's Diane's day off.

02:43.892 --> 02:46.427
l'll have a beer then, l guess.

02:46.600 --> 02:50.675
You look a little glum, buddy.
Do you have a problem?

02:50.849 --> 02:55.138
My new boss just chewed me out.
He says l lack enthusiasm.

02:55.307 --> 02:58.339
Well, is that true?

02:58.514 --> 03:02.129
l don't know. l guess. Who cares?

03:02.305 --> 03:04.342
Well, here it is, Dr Ludlow.

03:04.513 --> 03:09.217
lt was Diane's idea to expose you
to Boston's seamy underbelly.

03:09.387 --> 03:14.009
Frasier, Dr Ludlow will enjoy
a quaint little Boston pub.

03:14.179 --> 03:16.845
l wonder who the guy is with them.

03:17.012 --> 03:19.713
A talent scout for a geek show.

03:19.886 --> 03:23.050
l wish that l'd worn a heavier overcoat.

03:23.220 --> 03:26.833
- l had no idea it would be so chilly.
- l apologise.

03:27.010 --> 03:29.415
You're apologising for the weather?

03:29.592 --> 03:33.253
Yes, and the fact that
l've had this toasty garment.

03:33.426 --> 03:37.466
- Why don't you wear it?
- We're not exactly the same size.

03:37.634 --> 03:40.003
- l'm sorry.
- Stop apologising.

03:40.175 --> 03:42.461
That's all right. l don't mind.

03:42.632 --> 03:45.251
- Frasier...
- l'm sorry.

03:45.424 --> 03:49.252
l turn to jelly in the presence
of my mentor, Dr Ludlow.

03:49.423 --> 03:53.582
This attitude was all right
when you were in my programme,

03:53.756 --> 03:55.793
but we are peers now.

03:55.964 --> 04:00.704
Did you hear that, Diane? Peers.
Ludlow, get us some brandies!

04:00.880 --> 04:03.747
No, l'm just kidding. l'll get them.

04:03.921 --> 04:08.624
- Diane, could you give me a hand?
- Certainly. Excuse me.

04:11.628 --> 04:13.867
- Did you notice?
- Of course.

04:14.044 --> 04:17.704
- What are we going to do about it?
- lgnore it.

04:17.877 --> 04:22.284
lgnore it? That's like telling me
to ignore your fly being open.

04:22.459 --> 04:24.911
Yes, very good point.

04:26.000 --> 04:28.454
lt isn't, is it?

04:30.667 --> 04:32.704
What's the problem here?

04:32.875 --> 04:36.405
My colleague has
dropped a crumb during dinner

04:36.582 --> 04:39.579
and it has become encrusted on his tie.

04:39.748 --> 04:44.570
So? You could take Norm's tie,
put it in a kettle and make soup.

04:44.747 --> 04:49.949
lncidentally, the tie was invented
in ancient times to be used as a bib.

04:50.122 --> 04:55.158
- You know, to wipe your chin.
- They're thinking of changing that?

04:55.330 --> 04:57.698
Why not just tell the guy?

04:57.870 --> 05:01.153
Why didn't we come
to Sam in the first place?

05:01.329 --> 05:06.613
You don't say ''there's a spot'' to a man
of the stature of Dr Bennett Ludlow.

05:06.786 --> 05:09.618
The Bennett Ludlow?

05:09.786 --> 05:12.356
- You've heard of him, Coach?
- No.

05:15.493 --> 05:20.398
He's one of the giants of psychiatry.
Author, innovator, educator,

05:20.576 --> 05:23.146
and my idol and inspiration.

05:23.325 --> 05:26.772
Lean over and pretend
to admire his tie tack,

05:26.949 --> 05:30.480
and just nibble the morsel off real quick.

05:30.657 --> 05:34.732
- Who's the wiser?
- Sam is right. We have to tell him.

05:34.907 --> 05:38.521
Of course you're right.
May we have three brandies?

05:38.698 --> 05:42.393
l should tell him.
l suggested beef Wellington.

05:42.572 --> 05:46.944
Beef Wellington, you say?
Where's that tie? Show me.

05:48.154 --> 05:50.192
l'll just have to tell him

05:50.363 --> 05:53.809
in a subtle way
that will preserve his dignity.

05:56.612 --> 06:02.523
Hey, pigpen! What's that thing?
Are you trying to catch pigeons?

06:03.694 --> 06:05.399
Thank you.

06:05.568 --> 06:09.857
Don't mention it. l like a man
who wears his dinner with pride.

06:11.858 --> 06:18.981
Here. Sir, it may cause you
some personal embarrassment,

06:19.150 --> 06:21.187
but you have a spot...

06:22.150 --> 06:23.974
...in my heart.

06:24.149 --> 06:27.229
- Always will.
- Thank you, Frasier.

06:27.398 --> 06:31.438
lf you'll excuse me,
l've got a telephone call to make.

06:35.771 --> 06:41.471
Believe me, l am not the sort of man
who approaches young ladies

06:41.645 --> 06:45.473
and tries to be more familiar
by using some smooth line.

06:45.645 --> 06:48.216
Your secret is safe with me.

06:49.436 --> 06:51.474
Pardon me for saying this,

06:51.644 --> 06:55.340
but something about you
is so strikingly attractive.

06:55.518 --> 07:00.174
While you're stare at my zoomers,
let's see if we can figure it out.

07:01.643 --> 07:05.849
- How can l get your telephone number?
- A phone book.

07:06.016 --> 07:11.597
Would you tell me your name
or shall l check under ''Hot Babe''?

07:13.557 --> 07:18.759
The name is Carla Tortelli
and l'm starting to like you.

07:27.138 --> 07:29.175
- Say, Norm?
- Yes, Cliff?

07:29.346 --> 07:32.297
You seem to have a spot on your tie.

07:33.388 --> 07:37.216
So l do, so l do.
Thank you for pointing that out.

07:37.387 --> 07:40.006
lf more people were as conscientious,

07:40.179 --> 07:43.294
we could wipe out
social embarrassment.

07:43.469 --> 07:45.507
Don't thank me, Norm.

07:45.678 --> 07:49.965
Periodic tie checks are the duty
of every American citizen.

07:53.009 --> 07:55.248
- Did he look at his tie?
- No.

07:55.426 --> 07:58.293
So much for subtlety. All right.

07:58.467 --> 08:02.046
You start a fire for diversion.
l'll hose him down.

08:03.799 --> 08:06.713
- Boy, am l exhausted.
- Not much sleep?

08:06.882 --> 08:08.920
No, l slept like a baby.

08:09.090 --> 08:13.830
lt's just that l dreamed
l had insomnia all night.

08:17.005 --> 08:22.041
Someday that man's head
will open up and a prize will pop out.

08:24.921 --> 08:27.835
- Hi, everybody.
- Hey, Carla.

08:28.004 --> 08:30.408
- l got some flowers here.
- For me?

08:30.586 --> 08:32.623
Very cute, Carla.

08:32.794 --> 08:36.705
You've had flowers
every day for two weeks.

08:36.878 --> 08:40.456
Yeah, l guess l ought to be feeling guilty.

08:40.626 --> 08:45.828
l'm getting all these flowers
and there are bees going hungry.

08:46.001 --> 08:50.124
We're kind of curious here.
Who's your secret admirer?

08:53.624 --> 08:57.748
- lt's none of your damn business.
- Thank you, Carla.

09:02.331 --> 09:05.614
- What did she say?
- None of your damn business.

09:05.790 --> 09:09.071
Well, excuse me for living.

09:09.247 --> 09:13.820
What if l said that when you asked me
how to throw a knuckleball?

09:13.996 --> 09:17.693
- You did.
- So we're even.

09:20.245 --> 09:22.994
Frasier, you're early.

09:24.037 --> 09:27.733
- ls something wrong?
- Of course something's wrong.

09:27.911 --> 09:32.153
Dr Ludlow cancelled on us again.
Surprise, surprise.

09:32.327 --> 09:36.486
- What excuse did he give this time?
- Something came up.

09:36.659 --> 09:40.783
Something's been coming up
for the last two months.

09:40.951 --> 09:47.113
Well, maybe we have to admit
he doesn't want to see us socially.

09:47.283 --> 09:50.233
l guess we've been trying too hard.

09:50.408 --> 09:53.357
Sam, can l get a beer, please?

09:53.531 --> 09:58.272
Especially the first night when we made
such buffoons of ourselves.

09:58.448 --> 10:01.446
- We, Frasier?
- All right, you.

10:03.697 --> 10:05.438
- Me?
- Yes!

10:05.613 --> 10:08.480
The way you fawned
over him was criminal.

10:08.654 --> 10:11.143
lf you had taken off your clothes,

10:11.320 --> 10:14.650
it would have been
a refreshing note of subtlety.

10:14.820 --> 10:16.894
No wonder he's shunning us.

10:17.069 --> 10:19.736
Frasier, you were so obsequious,

10:19.902 --> 10:22.852
if he had asked you to cluck
and lay an egg,

10:23.027 --> 10:25.941
you would have asked, '' What colour?''

10:26.110 --> 10:30.020
Well, he didn't ask me to,
so it's a moot point at best.

10:30.193 --> 10:31.850
l'm sorry.

10:32.026 --> 10:36.433
Diane, l need tonight off.
Could you switch with me?

10:36.608 --> 10:38.765
- Well...
- Why not?

10:38.942 --> 10:43.479
- There's nothing going on in our lives.
- Carla, you're in luck again.

10:43.649 --> 10:47.725
lt seems when you want to trade nights,
my plans get cancelled.

10:47.898 --> 10:50.054
Yeah, go figure.

10:52.064 --> 10:54.469
Hey, Diane.

10:54.646 --> 10:57.135
You know, l've been thinking...

10:57.313 --> 10:59.350
Have you?

10:59.521 --> 11:03.300
The odds makers take a beating again.

11:03.479 --> 11:08.633
Listen, is it possible this Ludlow
fellow hasn't been seeing you two

11:08.811 --> 11:12.722
because he's been spending
all his time with Carla?

11:12.894 --> 11:16.722
Either that or he had to
finish his paper route on Mars.

11:18.018 --> 11:22.343
Sorry you felt the sting of my wit,
but it's ludicrous.

11:22.518 --> 11:26.724
Now wait a minute.
There are two mysteries going on here.

11:26.892 --> 11:30.636
Carla's been seeing
this very classy guy,

11:30.808 --> 11:34.718
and your pal's been
avoiding you like the plague.

11:34.891 --> 11:38.587
Of course, that's the lesser
of the two mysteries.

11:41.806 --> 11:46.509
You're talking about one of the most
accomplished men of letters,

11:46.680 --> 11:48.718
dating a common barmaid.

11:48.888 --> 11:51.377
- So are you.
- She wasn't when l met her.

11:51.555 --> 11:54.173
That's right. She was a lunatic.

11:57.095 --> 11:59.169
No, it's true, Coach.

11:59.345 --> 12:04.759
Many scientists believe
that the little finger, that's the pinkie,

12:04.927 --> 12:09.383
will, like the tail, disappear
cos it serves no useful purpose.

12:09.552 --> 12:13.592
People couldn't go swimming
without their little finger.

12:14.593 --> 12:16.630
Why is that, Coach?

12:16.801 --> 12:20.379
When you come out of the water,
you can't do this.

12:21.341 --> 12:23.379
l stand corrected.

12:23.549 --> 12:26.666
Sam, may l speak to you for a moment?

12:26.841 --> 12:29.507
OK, a cute lunatic. All right?

12:31.257 --> 12:35.202
Frasier is in a very fragile state of mind.

12:35.381 --> 12:41.128
Your asinine theories, while suitable
fodder for inane bar conversation,

12:41.297 --> 12:43.915
do nothing to ease his pique.

12:44.088 --> 12:49.752
Wait a minute. The one word l
understood, l don't exactly care for.

12:49.920 --> 12:52.622
- My theory's not asinine.
- You're right.

12:52.795 --> 12:57.417
lt's a lot worse.
Think of the two of them together.

12:57.587 --> 13:01.792
Bennett Ludlow and Carla?
lt's hair-brained.

13:01.960 --> 13:04.033
Just imagine it!

13:04.210 --> 13:06.248
Well, there it is now.

13:08.542 --> 13:11.326
- No, l guess l haven't.
- Diane, what's...

13:18.957 --> 13:24.656
Benny here may look like a stiff,
but he's out for a good time.

13:26.623 --> 13:29.455
l was drawn to Carla from the start.

13:29.623 --> 13:33.401
There's something sensual
and earthy about her.

13:33.580 --> 13:35.949
Didn't any of you suspect?

13:36.121 --> 13:39.569
No, you'd have to be a real brain
to figure this out,

13:39.746 --> 13:42.115
don't you think, Frasier?

13:42.287 --> 13:45.154
How come you kept it such a secret?

13:45.328 --> 13:48.242
That's the way me
and Big Ben wanted it.

13:48.411 --> 13:52.948
Our backgrounds are a little different,
which is a slight problem.

13:53.118 --> 13:57.656
lf word gets around your guy
tucks his T-shirt in his undershorts,

13:57.826 --> 14:00.860
your reputation is shot to hell.

14:01.035 --> 14:04.067
And l had similar reasons to be discrete.

14:04.242 --> 14:07.654
Yeah, well. The cat's out of the bag now.

14:07.825 --> 14:11.236
Excuse me,
l have to see my customers.

14:11.407 --> 14:14.109
This calls for somebody to buy a round!

14:14.282 --> 14:18.854
- Well, l'll do that!
- You beat me to it. l'll get the next one.

14:19.906 --> 14:22.145
Diane, excuse me.

14:23.572 --> 14:26.819
Now that l'm running in egghead circles,

14:26.989 --> 14:30.270
we're going to bump
into each other at parties.

14:30.445 --> 14:34.771
You with your boyfriend
and me with mine... His hero.

14:37.236 --> 14:41.396
OK, l think l've come to terms with this.

14:41.569 --> 14:45.893
Dr Ludlow,
you came here on vacation.

14:46.069 --> 14:49.150
You've had your walk on the wild side.

14:49.318 --> 14:51.771
You can return
to your proper sphere,

14:51.943 --> 14:54.311
refreshed and a better man.

14:54.484 --> 14:58.098
Frankly, it's a bit more
complicated than that.

14:58.275 --> 15:01.889
l'm going to take a short trip,
and when l come back

15:02.066 --> 15:05.265
l'm going to ask
Ms Tortelli to marry me.

15:05.440 --> 15:08.058
How wonderful.

15:16.148 --> 15:20.603
- Sam, where is she?
- l don't know. She's never late.

15:20.772 --> 15:22.809
- Did Carla call?
- Yeah.

15:22.979 --> 15:27.138
- What did she say?
- None of your damn business.

15:28.853 --> 15:31.009
How's your knuckleball?

15:31.186 --> 15:33.591
Come on, we've been over this.

15:33.769 --> 15:35.806
Give me a break, will you?

15:38.019 --> 15:39.973
Dr Ludlow?

15:40.143 --> 15:44.800
We're happy that Carla's
getting the first break of her life.

15:46.559 --> 15:50.718
All this talk about romance
gives me a warm spot right here.

15:50.891 --> 15:54.008
Or was it that meal
l had at the Hungry Heifer?

15:54.182 --> 15:58.258
Yes. l went back
for their special chicken dinner.

15:58.432 --> 16:02.296
- What was it?
- A bowl of pellets and a handful of grain.

16:02.473 --> 16:05.554
Well, here she is.

16:07.389 --> 16:09.426
What's going on?

16:09.597 --> 16:13.425
Dr Ludlow has something
he wants to talk to you about.

16:19.970 --> 16:22.967
l had not expected
there to be a spectators.

16:23.136 --> 16:26.169
Perhaps you'd like to step over here?

16:33.010 --> 16:35.628
Benny, is this what l think it is?

16:35.801 --> 16:39.248
Yes, Carla. l want you to marry me.

16:41.801 --> 16:45.165
- Wow, what a day!
- Well, will you?

16:48.341 --> 16:53.330
- l guess l'd be crazy to say no.
- Champagne, please, for everybody!

16:53.506 --> 16:55.543
All right.

16:57.922 --> 16:59.960
Way to go, Doc.

17:00.130 --> 17:01.956
Thank you.

17:02.130 --> 17:04.334
lt happened right here.

17:04.505 --> 17:08.367
Thank you. Thank you.
Champagne for everybody.

17:18.919 --> 17:24.038
l couldn't help noticing
you're not exactly leaping for joy.

17:24.209 --> 17:27.824
Bennett Ludlow is a wonderful catch.

17:28.001 --> 17:31.864
Well...there's some things
he doesn't know about me.

17:32.042 --> 17:35.040
A little mystery
is good for a marriage.

17:35.208 --> 17:37.246
What haven't you told him?

17:37.417 --> 17:41.244
l haven't been
completely honest about my kids.

17:41.416 --> 17:44.330
What haven't you told him about them?

17:44.498 --> 17:46.536
That they live.

17:47.873 --> 17:53.536
He doesn't know you have children?
Carla, l think you'd better tell him.

17:53.705 --> 17:56.951
He's going to wonder
who those little people are.

17:57.121 --> 18:00.154
l was hoping he'd be too polite to ask.

18:01.078 --> 18:03.449
l didn't want to scare him off.

18:03.620 --> 18:07.565
lt's only fair that you
tell him you have five children.

18:07.744 --> 18:10.314
- Six.
- OK, six.

18:10.494 --> 18:13.161
But don't wait... l thought it was five.

18:13.326 --> 18:16.573
lt was. l just came from the doctor.

18:22.618 --> 18:26.314
When you were in high school
and you took Hygiene...

18:27.741 --> 18:30.408
...did you cut the how-not-to lecture?

18:30.574 --> 18:33.109
l had to. l was pregnant.

18:34.241 --> 18:36.859
l'm the most fertile woman living.

18:37.032 --> 18:40.444
There's only one foolproof
method of birth control,

18:40.615 --> 18:42.652
and it makes me sick.

18:42.823 --> 18:46.234
- What's that?
- Saying no.

18:46.405 --> 18:52.152
- Carla, are you all right?
- l'll just go celebrate.

18:52.321 --> 18:56.480
We're like a big family.
You know what they say, more to love.

18:56.653 --> 18:59.106
lf you want to be in a big fa...

18:59.278 --> 19:01.352
- Beat it.
- Bye.

19:03.986 --> 19:08.773
My proposal was not met
with the enthusiasm l expected,

19:08.944 --> 19:13.564
and it suddenly occurred to me
that l never heard the word ''yes''.

19:13.734 --> 19:16.057
l know.

19:16.233 --> 19:20.771
l got to tell you some things.
Would you sit down for a minute?

19:21.650 --> 19:23.770
- This sounds serious.
- lt is.

19:28.149 --> 19:31.181
Have you seen ''The Brady Bunch''?

19:32.106 --> 19:34.594
Yes, l think so.

19:34.773 --> 19:37.806
Well, picture them with knives.

19:41.021 --> 19:43.225
l don't understand.

19:44.188 --> 19:46.427
l have five kids.

19:47.729 --> 19:51.804
- Five?
- Well, five and counting.

19:53.811 --> 19:56.264
You're going to be a daddy.

19:58.602 --> 20:00.758
This is quite a day.

20:00.936 --> 20:04.596
You have my permission
to withdraw your proposal.

20:04.769 --> 20:08.049
Do you want me
to withdraw my proposal?

20:08.225 --> 20:11.306
l want you to do
what you want to do.

20:15.058 --> 20:17.724
l want you to marry me.

20:18.807 --> 20:21.473
You're kidding.

20:21.640 --> 20:23.761
What class!

20:24.765 --> 20:27.632
l still haven't heard the word ''yes''.

20:30.180 --> 20:33.960
l know. Why do you think that is?

20:34.138 --> 20:39.423
l think that if you look
into your feelings, you'll know.

20:40.553 --> 20:42.591
Oh, yeah?

20:50.594 --> 20:53.164
Yeah, l think l do.

20:55.510 --> 20:59.455
- l'm in love with someone else.
- Who is it, Carla?

21:01.092 --> 21:04.504
l don't know his name.
l've never even met him.

21:04.675 --> 21:09.710
But l've had this picture of him in
my mind for what seems like forever.

21:09.882 --> 21:13.294
But he is going to walk
into this bar one night.

21:13.465 --> 21:16.795
Well, not walk, more like swagger.

21:16.964 --> 21:20.246
You know, confident, but not cocky.

21:21.464 --> 21:24.627
He's OK-looking, but he's no pretty-boy.

21:25.922 --> 21:28.836
He's a swell dresser.

21:29.004 --> 21:32.867
He's got on this burgundy leather jacket.

21:34.337 --> 21:39.574
He's got cherry LifeSavers in one pocket
and a pack of Camels in the other.

21:39.753 --> 21:43.615
He's trying to quit them both,
but he can't.

21:43.794 --> 21:48.367
His nose is broken in all the right places.

21:49.584 --> 21:53.826
And he's got this scar
that he won't talk about.

21:54.001 --> 21:58.372
He cracks his knuckles all the time.
But what are you going to do?

22:00.167 --> 22:04.158
Doesn't talk much. Doesn't have to.

22:04.331 --> 22:07.246
He falls for me. Hard.

22:08.623 --> 22:12.035
l hurt him a few times. He gets over it.

22:13.164 --> 22:15.201
We get married.

22:19.579 --> 22:22.032
So, you see,

22:22.204 --> 22:26.991
it'd be a little messy if l was
already married when he got here.

22:28.787 --> 22:32.779
You know, Carla,
l sort of have a dream girl myself.

22:32.952 --> 22:35.985
Tell me about her.

22:36.160 --> 22:41.907
Well, she's a spunky, hearty,
curly-haired little spitfire

22:42.076 --> 22:45.606
who doesn't know
what's really good for her.

22:49.284 --> 22:53.027
- l hope you find her someday.
- Me too.

22:56.448 --> 23:00.109
l intend to take care
of that child financially.

23:00.281 --> 23:03.445
You bet your buns you will, Benny baby.

23:24.527 --> 23:27.774
- Are you OK?
- Would you knock it off?

23:30.193 --> 23:35.856
OK, you're all going to know eventually
so you might as well know now.

23:36.025 --> 23:39.853
l turned Benny down
and l'm pregnant again.

23:40.025 --> 23:43.390
So, in case your maths is bad,
that makes six.

23:43.566 --> 23:46.517
Six kids for an unmarried woman.

23:46.691 --> 23:49.937
l don't want your sappy looks
or your sympathy.

23:50.107 --> 23:52.808
l don't even want to talk about this.

23:52.981 --> 23:56.015
l just want to be left alone. Got it?

23:56.189 --> 23:58.677
Got it.

24:10.021 --> 24:13.551
What are you people made of, stone?
