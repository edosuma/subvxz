00:29.679 --> 00:32.613
I... I really don't
need to wear one.

00:32.682 --> 00:34.115
What?

00:34.184 --> 00:36.618
Yeah. I tested
negative, and, um...

00:36.686 --> 00:40.122
I've got this
unbelievable control.

00:41.658 --> 00:43.626
Ahem. Excuse me.

00:43.693 --> 00:45.126
Excuse me.
Up, up, up.

00:45.195 --> 00:46.628
What?
Something wrong?

00:46.696 --> 00:48.630
No. No, that was great.

00:48.698 --> 00:50.131
I had a really
nice night.

00:51.701 --> 00:53.362
Did-Did I
miss something?

00:53.436 --> 00:55.836
Nope, nothing.
You didn't miss anything.

00:55.905 --> 00:57.805
Nothing.

01:00.143 --> 01:01.576
Look...

01:01.644 --> 01:03.578
I'll-I'll-
I'll wear one.

01:03.646 --> 01:04.873
I'll happily wear one.

01:04.947 --> 01:07.576
But I just gotta
tell you right now it's...

01:07.650 --> 01:09.845
it's just... it's not
going to be as good.

01:09.919 --> 01:12.547
It's not going
to be as...

01:14.157 --> 01:15.590
I feel like I know you.

01:15.658 --> 01:17.592
I feel like I can
be honest with you.

01:17.660 --> 01:21.289
Yeah. Um... you should really
ignore all those feelings.

01:21.364 --> 01:23.093
Can I call you?

01:23.166 --> 01:25.100
No.

01:25.168 --> 01:27.466
Is that a real no
or a...

01:27.537 --> 01:29.971
No, you should
consider that a...

01:30.040 --> 01:31.064
hard no.

01:46.689 --> 01:49.123
Hey, Ma, do me a favor.

01:49.192 --> 01:50.659
Don't ever fix me up again.

01:55.365 --> 01:56.423
I'm sitting

01:56.499 --> 01:58.763
Sitting in a boat all day

02:00.070 --> 02:01.765
I been thinkin'

02:01.838 --> 02:04.705
Thinkin' what I might say

02:04.774 --> 02:06.935
I been lookin'

02:07.010 --> 02:09.877
Over the top of that hill

02:09.946 --> 02:11.971
And I been battlin'

02:12.048 --> 02:13.982
Battlin'with my will

02:15.985 --> 02:20.547
I got somethin'
to say to you

02:20.623 --> 02:25.253
Yeah, I got something I want
you to show me how to do

02:25.328 --> 02:27.091
'Cause I'm hungry, Lord

02:27.163 --> 02:28.391
The lake is full

02:29.833 --> 02:31.596
Show me how to catch a fish

02:31.668 --> 02:33.033
I don't know
what happened.

02:33.103 --> 02:35.037
Somewhere along the way,
I screwed up.

02:35.105 --> 02:36.595
Either in high school
or college

02:36.673 --> 02:38.106
or my early twenties.

02:38.174 --> 02:40.301
I mean, you know, I really
thought, hey, this is a snap.

02:40.376 --> 02:42.606
I like men. Men like me.

02:42.679 --> 02:43.941
But then somewhere
in the last year or so,

02:44.013 --> 02:45.913
I just... I've just gotten
so screwed up.

02:45.982 --> 02:47.609
This might not make
any sense to you, Darce.

02:47.684 --> 02:49.117
I mean,
you've been married

02:49.185 --> 02:50.618
since you got
out of college.

02:50.687 --> 02:52.314
I was born married,
baby.

02:52.388 --> 02:54.117
But I think I'm finally
coming to realize

02:54.190 --> 02:55.623
I like being single,
you know?

02:55.692 --> 02:57.125
Love being
self-sufficient.

02:57.193 --> 02:58.626
And I truly believe

02:58.695 --> 03:00.060
that this is
my nature, you know?

03:00.130 --> 03:01.563
So what I'm
going to do is

03:01.631 --> 03:03.064
I'm just taking myself
out of the game.

03:03.133 --> 03:04.566
Put my mother
out of her misery,

03:04.634 --> 03:06.067
put me
out of my misery.

03:06.136 --> 03:07.569
Why are you looking
at me like that?

03:07.637 --> 03:08.569
Sorry. Let me
understand this.

03:08.638 --> 03:09.570
So if Sam
asked you out-

03:09.639 --> 03:10.606
Darcy! Shh!

03:10.673 --> 03:12.072
You would just say,
"No, Sam."

03:12.142 --> 03:13.575
What are you doing?
He works here!

03:13.643 --> 03:15.076
Do you want him
to hear you?

03:15.145 --> 03:16.077
Sam. Sam.

03:16.146 --> 03:17.078
Shut up.

03:17.147 --> 03:18.079
Sam. Sam.

03:18.148 --> 03:19.080
Shut up. Shut up.

03:19.149 --> 03:21.083
Oh, hit me. Hit me.
I love it, Sam.

03:21.151 --> 03:22.243
Oh, God. You are
unbelievable.

03:38.668 --> 03:41.831
Okay, kids.

03:41.905 --> 03:47.605
Gulden's mustard has traditionally been
the number two mustard in America.

03:47.677 --> 03:50.612
What the Gulden's people are
looking for is increased sampling.

03:50.680 --> 03:54.138
They're convinced that if they can
get people to try their product,

03:54.217 --> 03:56.151
they'll keep on using it.

03:56.219 --> 03:59.120
Three other agencies
in addition to ours

03:59.189 --> 04:02.056
have been invited to participate
in the review.

04:02.125 --> 04:04.559
The pitch is on Friday...

04:04.627 --> 04:08.563
and we don't leave this room
until we're solid on a concept.

04:14.137 --> 04:15.365
You have
a good night now.

04:15.438 --> 04:16.564
Yeah, you, too.

04:52.175 --> 04:55.110
Ahem. Um...

04:55.178 --> 04:59.114
Didn't Cindy Crawford
graduate second in her class?

04:59.182 --> 05:01.548
Did Cindy Crawford
graduate?

05:01.618 --> 05:03.552
I think she did.
Second in her class.

05:03.620 --> 05:05.212
In biochemistry, I think.

05:05.288 --> 05:07.222
Excuse me?

05:07.290 --> 05:09.850
Please. My friend-
my colleague-is having an epiphany.

05:09.926 --> 05:11.120
Oh.

05:11.194 --> 05:12.957
Okay.

05:13.029 --> 05:14.929
Um, I'll...

05:14.998 --> 05:17.933
I'll, uh, I'll give you
the print first.

05:18.001 --> 05:19.798
Um, okay. Big picture
of Cindy Crawford.

05:19.869 --> 05:21.302
Already
this is good.

05:21.371 --> 05:25.068
The headline reads "If you
never gave number two a try,

05:25.141 --> 05:27.075
think what
you'd be missing."

05:27.143 --> 05:28.576
In comes a picture of Cindy,

05:28.645 --> 05:30.977
and beneath that,
a little log line that says,

05:31.047 --> 05:33.538
"Cindy Crawford graduated
second from Podunk University,

05:33.616 --> 05:34.947
a B.S. In biochemistry."

05:35.018 --> 05:38.078
Then on the facing page,
a beauty shot of Gulden's mustard.

05:38.154 --> 05:40.588
And beneath that
in big letters,

05:40.657 --> 05:45.594
"Gulden's mustard. Number two,
and that ain't bad."

05:47.163 --> 05:49.097
That was impressive.

05:49.165 --> 05:51.099
I have to tell you.

05:51.167 --> 05:53.101
I could hardly keep
my legs together.

05:53.169 --> 05:54.602
You were so-

05:54.671 --> 05:56.104
Darce?

05:56.172 --> 05:57.605
I want that.

05:57.674 --> 05:59.608
Well, we all want that.

05:59.676 --> 06:01.541
No, I mean I want that.
You know what I mean?

06:01.611 --> 06:05.047
I want a billboard in the middle
of Times Square, okay?

06:05.114 --> 06:07.548
I want... I want
a commercial

06:07.617 --> 06:09.050
in the middle of
the Academy Awards,

06:09.118 --> 06:13.054
and I want a 10-page
layout in Vanity Fair.

06:13.122 --> 06:15.556
And that's...
that's what I want.

06:15.625 --> 06:17.058
Yeah, me, too.

06:18.127 --> 06:19.560
God, we're shallow.

06:19.629 --> 06:20.561
Argh!

06:20.630 --> 06:22.154
Ha ha ha!

06:22.231 --> 06:24.597
I am making money

06:24.667 --> 06:26.464
I am loaded

06:26.536 --> 06:28.060
Well, your day
is coming soon.

06:28.137 --> 06:30.298
They're going to give you
an account of your own

06:30.373 --> 06:32.341
and a window
and some new furniture.

06:32.408 --> 06:35.343
My furniture.
I like old furniture.

06:35.411 --> 06:37.072
Anyway, let me tell you
why I'm really here.

06:37.146 --> 06:38.579
Oh, I know
why you're here.

06:38.648 --> 06:40.582
I've been going over
my expense report,

06:40.650 --> 06:42.083
and, uh,
I want to let you know,

06:42.151 --> 06:43.584
in case anyone from
accounting should ask,

06:43.653 --> 06:48.090
that I had dinner with you
on the ninth, on the 11th,

06:48.157 --> 06:50.057
a humdinger on the 23rd,

06:50.126 --> 06:53.584
and a light lunch
yesterday, okay?

06:55.164 --> 06:58.099
You know, I think I would really
feel a lot better about this

06:58.167 --> 07:00.362
if we actually did
have dinner onetime.

07:00.436 --> 07:01.801
I can't have dinner
with you, Kate.

07:01.871 --> 07:02.963
You know that.

07:03.039 --> 07:03.971
I do?

07:04.040 --> 07:05.268
Yes. Of course you do.

07:05.341 --> 07:06.308
Do I know why?

07:06.376 --> 07:07.707
Yes, you know why.
We both know why.

07:07.777 --> 07:11.474
You're simply...
too nice.

07:11.547 --> 07:14.573
I think you're mistaken
about that, Sam.

07:14.650 --> 07:16.242
I'm not.

07:16.319 --> 07:19.186
I can be a bad girl,
Sam.

07:19.255 --> 07:21.485
Not bad enough for me,
Kate.

07:21.557 --> 07:22.785
Oh, really?

07:22.859 --> 07:24.053
Truly.

07:24.127 --> 07:25.424
Uh!

07:27.630 --> 07:29.564
Yes.

07:34.637 --> 07:36.070
Okay.

07:36.139 --> 07:38.266
All right. All right.
Let's get down to business-

07:38.341 --> 07:42.072
The business of servicing this
multimillion-dollar account.

07:42.145 --> 07:44.079
Our account executive
in charge-

07:44.147 --> 07:46.274
Darcy O'Neil.

07:46.349 --> 07:47.577
Yes!

07:47.650 --> 07:49.083
Whoo!

07:49.152 --> 07:50.346
My girl!

07:50.420 --> 07:52.354
And our creative team
is going to be headed up

07:52.422 --> 07:54.481
by my good friend Sela here.

07:56.159 --> 08:00.994
She has asked- She has asked
for Dominic, Nancy, and Jim to assist.

08:07.103 --> 08:09.037
Kate. Kate.

08:09.105 --> 08:10.538
Look, I'm sorry.
I don't mean to be rude.

08:10.606 --> 08:12.540
I just want to get
my resume Xeroxed

08:12.608 --> 08:14.041
before all this
healthy rage wears off.

08:14.110 --> 08:15.543
Kate.

08:15.611 --> 08:17.135
Kate? Look, Kate.

08:17.213 --> 08:21.115
Look, I brought you to this agency,
and I'm glad I did.

08:21.184 --> 08:23.084
I know you conceived
that campaign.

08:23.152 --> 08:24.551
Let me talk to Mercer.
In fact, I'll get us a meeting

08:24.620 --> 08:26.747
where the both of us
could talk to him.

08:26.823 --> 08:29.883
Kate, I'm going to
talk to him. I am.

08:31.127 --> 08:32.822
You have that wedding
this weekend, right?

08:32.895 --> 08:34.054
Yeah.

08:34.130 --> 08:35.563
Okay, then.
Just do me a favor

08:35.631 --> 08:37.962
and please let me try
and make this right.

08:38.034 --> 08:39.467
Enjoy the weekend.

08:39.534 --> 08:41.058
I'll see you bright
and early on Monday, okay?

08:41.136 --> 08:42.570
Sure.

08:44.474 --> 08:47.272
You see that one
at Libby's station?

08:47.343 --> 08:48.776
She's marrying
a chiropodist.

08:48.845 --> 08:50.278
God's no fool.

08:50.346 --> 08:52.075
He gave her bad feet
for a reason.

08:52.148 --> 08:53.581
No. You know, maybe
that's my problem.

08:53.649 --> 08:55.583
Maybe I'm just
too damned healthy.

08:55.651 --> 08:58.085
I'm serious.
I bet there's an ob-gyn out there

08:58.154 --> 09:01.521
who's just waiting for me to come
walking into his office, you know?

09:01.591 --> 09:03.354
That would explain all those
damn yeast infections,

09:03.426 --> 09:04.518
don't you think?

09:04.594 --> 09:07.028
Don't be a smart ass,
and watch your mouth.

09:07.096 --> 09:08.529
This is a place
of business.

09:08.598 --> 09:11.897
You know who I met
at the supermarket the other day?

09:11.968 --> 09:13.060
Who?

09:13.135 --> 09:15.035
Mark Mclntyre. Whatever
happened with him, hmm?

09:15.104 --> 09:16.537
He's gay, Ma.

09:16.606 --> 09:18.039
So?

09:18.107 --> 09:19.039
Oh.

09:19.108 --> 09:20.541
Well, what are you
making faces?

09:20.610 --> 09:22.043
You think I don't know
I sound neurotic?

09:22.111 --> 09:23.544
I know.
I can hear myself.

09:25.615 --> 09:28.550
I'd like a grandchild.

09:28.618 --> 09:30.051
So...

09:30.119 --> 09:31.552
Shoot me.

09:31.621 --> 09:33.555
All right, Ma.
Well, you'll be happy to know

09:33.623 --> 09:35.557
I'm looking into
getting some eggs frozen.

09:35.625 --> 09:38.560
Wonderful. I can tell everyone
I'm having a grandsicle, hmm?

09:38.628 --> 09:41.062
Ha ha! Oh, come on, now.
That was good.

09:41.130 --> 09:43.564
Well, it was cute.
It was definitely clever.

09:43.633 --> 09:46.568
Okay. Any idea what we're planning
up here with these rollers?

09:46.636 --> 09:49.571
Well, for once I want your hair
out of your eyes.

09:49.639 --> 09:54.076
I want your eyes and your
ears open at this wedding.

09:54.143 --> 09:59.080
A wedding is a wonderful
place to meet new people.

10:11.160 --> 10:16.655
As the power vested in me
by the state of New York,

10:16.732 --> 10:22.102
I now pronounce you, Sajit,
and you, Susan, as man and wife.

10:22.171 --> 10:24.605
You may kiss the bride, please.

10:33.649 --> 10:35.640
K.C. & The Sunshine Band:
Do a little dance

10:35.718 --> 10:37.583
Make a little love

10:37.653 --> 10:41.984
Get down tonight

10:42.058 --> 10:44.390
Do a little dance

10:44.460 --> 10:46.155
Make a little love

10:46.228 --> 10:50.526
Get down tonight

10:50.600 --> 10:53.899
Get down, get down,
get down, get down

10:53.970 --> 10:56.200
Get down tonight, baby

10:56.272 --> 10:59.036
Woowoowoowoo
woowoowoowoo

10:59.108 --> 11:02.373
Get down, get down,
get down, get down

11:02.445 --> 11:04.572
Get down tonight, baby

11:04.647 --> 11:07.582
Nah nah nah nah nah
nah nah nah nah nah

11:07.650 --> 11:10.585
Oh. Hi.

11:12.655 --> 11:13.587
Hi.

11:13.656 --> 11:14.588
Hello.
How are you?

11:14.657 --> 11:15.589
Hello.

11:15.658 --> 11:17.091
Woman Over P A: Hello, everybody.

11:20.162 --> 11:24.599
Thank you all for coming
and for being a part of

11:24.667 --> 11:28.603
this very special
wedding celebration.

11:28.671 --> 11:32.107
Sajit and I really wanted today
to be unique.

11:32.174 --> 11:33.664
One new thing.

11:33.743 --> 11:36.678
Uh, in the center of each table,

11:36.746 --> 11:41.479
you'll find a Polaroid camera
and boxes of film.

11:41.550 --> 11:43.814
They're there because
we want all of you

11:43.886 --> 11:47.185
to be our wedding photographers.

11:47.256 --> 11:52.091
Feel free to keep any pictures
you want or give them to us

11:52.161 --> 11:53.685
or to other guests.

11:56.399 --> 11:57.991
Whoo!

11:58.067 --> 12:00.126
That's the idea.

12:00.202 --> 12:04.662
Dion: Yeah, I should have known it
from the very start

12:04.740 --> 12:07.208
This girl will leave me
with a broken heart

12:07.276 --> 12:10.609
Now listen people
what I'm telling you

12:10.680 --> 12:13.080
A- keep away
from a Runaround Sue

12:13.149 --> 12:16.778
Yeah, I miss her lips
and the smile on her face

12:16.852 --> 12:19.343
The touch of her hair
and this girl's warm embrace

12:19.422 --> 12:22.448
So if you don't wanna cry
like I do

12:22.525 --> 12:25.460
A- keep away
from a Runaround Sue

12:25.528 --> 12:27.996
Whoa...

12:31.167 --> 12:32.794
Susan's
single friend Kate?

12:35.171 --> 12:36.138
Excuse me?

12:37.673 --> 12:39.106
I'm sorry. I'm Nick.

12:39.175 --> 12:40.608
I'm looking for Susan's
single friend Kate.

12:40.676 --> 12:42.109
They told me they thought she
came out here.

12:42.178 --> 12:44.112
Yeah. That's me.

12:44.180 --> 12:45.613
Can I help you?

12:45.681 --> 12:47.546
Don't you think that's,
uh, kind of strange

12:47.616 --> 12:49.311
that she only has
one friend?

12:52.688 --> 12:54.622
Ahem. Okay. Uh...
basically what I'm doing

12:54.690 --> 12:58.126
is, uh, putting together a video
testimonial for Susan and Sajit.

12:58.194 --> 12:59.627
Just, you know,
all their friends

12:59.695 --> 13:01.094
wishing them the best
of everything,

13:01.163 --> 13:04.690
eternal bliss, truckloads of happiness,
et cetera, et cetera.

13:04.767 --> 13:06.098
Do you do this
for a living?

13:06.168 --> 13:07.601
Videotape weddings?
Yeah.

13:07.670 --> 13:09.069
Bar mitzvahs, too.

13:09.138 --> 13:11.072
But, uh, in this case
it's kind of strange

13:11.140 --> 13:13.074
because I'm also
Sajit's best friend,

13:13.142 --> 13:15.576
so I'm sort of
a working guest.

13:15.644 --> 13:17.077
You know,
pulling double duty.

13:17.146 --> 13:18.078
Mm-hmm.

13:18.147 --> 13:20.081
All right. You're on.

13:20.149 --> 13:22.083
Oh. Wow. That was fast.

13:22.151 --> 13:23.584
Um, okay.

13:24.653 --> 13:26.587
Hi, Susan. Hi, Sajit.

13:26.655 --> 13:28.418
Uh, congratulations.

13:28.491 --> 13:32.427
Just have a great time.
Call me when you get back, and, um...

13:32.495 --> 13:35.931
Oh, and if you see
a really big gift,

13:35.998 --> 13:38.592
really expensive gift
with no card,

13:38.667 --> 13:40.100
it's mine.

13:40.169 --> 13:41.602
My gift to you.

13:41.670 --> 13:43.103
Okay. Um, that's all.

13:43.172 --> 13:46.608
So have a wonderful time,
and I'll see you when you get back.

13:46.675 --> 13:47.607
Bye.

13:51.180 --> 13:54.115
Okay. Can... Can you
cut it now?

13:54.183 --> 13:57.751
Cut it.

13:57.820 --> 13:58.752
What?

13:58.821 --> 13:59.753
Cut it.

13:59.822 --> 14:00.811
Oh. I'm sorry.

14:00.890 --> 14:02.050
You've done
this before, huh?

14:02.124 --> 14:03.056
Oh, yeah.

14:06.495 --> 14:08.053
Whoo!

14:08.130 --> 14:09.563
Well, so, uh, I gotta
get back inside.

14:09.632 --> 14:11.566
The bunny hop's coming up,
and I have to shoot that.

14:11.634 --> 14:12.566
Okay.

14:12.635 --> 14:13.567
It's contractual.

14:13.636 --> 14:14.796
All right.

14:14.870 --> 14:16.064
Kate? Nick.

14:16.138 --> 14:17.571
Good to meet you,
Nick.

14:17.640 --> 14:18.800
You bunny hop?

14:18.874 --> 14:20.068
No.

14:20.142 --> 14:21.439
All right.
I'll see you later.

14:27.650 --> 14:29.584
You're horny, huh?

14:29.652 --> 14:31.347
Yeah, I hear you.

14:39.195 --> 14:41.060
Yeah!

14:46.235 --> 14:48.100
Yes!

14:53.676 --> 14:55.075
Okay!

14:56.679 --> 14:59.147
All you single women...

14:59.215 --> 15:02.548
come on out here
and try to catch the bouquet!

15:02.618 --> 15:04.051
You going
to go out there?

15:04.119 --> 15:05.916
Uh-uh. I've been
married once. No, thanks.

15:05.988 --> 15:06.920
Okay.

15:08.858 --> 15:11.224
Get out there. Come on.
Yes, yes, yes. It'll be fun. Go.

15:23.138 --> 15:24.070
Ahem.

15:26.141 --> 15:28.075
Okay. Just give me
the damn thing.

15:30.079 --> 15:31.569
Oh, no, no.

15:31.647 --> 15:34.377
Captain And Tennille:
Love will keep us together

15:34.450 --> 15:37.977
Think of me, babe, whenever

15:38.053 --> 15:41.682
Some sweet-talking girl
comes along

15:41.757 --> 15:43.554
Singing a song

15:43.626 --> 15:47.062
Don't mess around,
you just gotta be strong

15:47.129 --> 15:48.858
Just stop

15:48.931 --> 15:51.126
'Cause I really love you

15:51.200 --> 15:52.360
Stop

15:52.434 --> 15:54.664
I've been thinking of you

15:54.737 --> 16:01.411
Look in my heart and let love
keep us together

16:04.113 --> 16:06.946
He's cute.

16:07.016 --> 16:08.449
So here's the deal.

16:08.518 --> 16:10.452
Mercer?
Yeah, he likes you,

16:10.520 --> 16:13.546
but he's got a real point of view
about your career path.

16:13.623 --> 16:15.557
So just, you know,
let him get that out of the way,

16:15.625 --> 16:16.557
and then-

16:16.626 --> 16:18.059
All right. Just relax.

16:18.127 --> 16:19.560
Trust me.

16:19.629 --> 16:21.062
I'm a little nervous.

16:24.634 --> 16:27.568
Hi.

16:27.637 --> 16:29.070
- Hi.
- Hi, Mr. Mercer.

16:29.138 --> 16:31.072
Thanks for taking
time to speak with me.

16:31.140 --> 16:33.574
Not a problem.
Not a problem.

16:33.643 --> 16:35.975
We're meeting some clients for lunch
downstairs in about 20 minutes,

16:36.045 --> 16:37.569
so I'm going to get right to
the point here, Katherine.

16:37.647 --> 16:39.171
Uh, Kate.

16:39.248 --> 16:42.581
Kate. Uh, you know, I think you're
doing a hell of a job for us, Kate.

16:42.652 --> 16:45.587
And I'm sorry if your role at the agency
isn't all you hoped it would be,

16:45.655 --> 16:47.623
but, uh, you know,
I suspect in time-

16:47.690 --> 16:49.783
What if I don't
want to wait?

16:49.859 --> 16:51.292
Hey. It's me.

16:51.360 --> 16:53.590
I mean, I think I'm
good at what I do.

16:53.663 --> 16:56.154
Obviously
the clients agree.

16:56.232 --> 16:58.860
I mean, otherwise we wouldn't be
landing all these accounts.

17:00.102 --> 17:03.538
Um, let me tell you
a little story, okay?

17:03.606 --> 17:05.039
When I started out
in advertising-

17:05.107 --> 17:07.439
We're talking
the early seventies here.

17:07.510 --> 17:09.535
The long beard, long hair,
and all that stuff.

17:09.612 --> 17:14.549
And like you, I felt that my talents and
my hard work weren't being appreciated.

17:14.617 --> 17:17.551
Anyway, I finally get
my 10 minutes with the boss,

17:17.619 --> 17:22.057
and he says to me, "Alan, in business
we dress for the job we want,

17:22.124 --> 17:25.355
not the job we have. Do you
really want to be the janitor? '

17:27.630 --> 17:29.063
What do you want
to be, Kate?

17:32.134 --> 17:33.999
I don't understand.

17:34.070 --> 17:36.004
Well, look at Darcy here.

17:36.072 --> 17:39.564
Now, you two are the same age,
but Darcy owns a home-

17:39.642 --> 17:41.633
a home that, in my opinion,
she can't really afford-

17:41.711 --> 17:44.145
and that pleases me no end

17:44.213 --> 17:47.114
because I know she's showing up
for work tomorrow.

17:47.183 --> 17:48.616
And this guy,

17:48.684 --> 17:50.584
I co-signed the loan
on his Mercedes.

17:50.653 --> 17:52.086
Happy to do it.

17:52.154 --> 17:53.587
He's not going anywhere.

17:53.656 --> 17:54.588
Sela here...

17:54.657 --> 17:56.591
Oh, yeah.
I've got it all:

17:56.659 --> 17:58.092
The husband,
the house,

17:58.160 --> 17:59.593
and the car
we can't afford.

17:59.662 --> 18:01.527
Which brings us to you.

18:01.597 --> 18:04.031
Now, unlike anyone else
who works for me,

18:04.100 --> 18:06.864
you're the only person I know who lives
like they're still in college.

18:06.936 --> 18:09.530
I mean, you're, uh, you know,
you're as free as a bird,

18:09.605 --> 18:10.799
which is fine...

18:10.873 --> 18:12.738
for you.

18:12.808 --> 18:17.404
But I'm not about to encourage you to develop
a relationship with one of my largest clients

18:17.480 --> 18:20.540
when I know there's nothing
keeping you from picking up

18:20.616 --> 18:22.243
and going to work
for one of my competitors

18:22.318 --> 18:26.152
and maybe taking
my big client with you.

18:30.126 --> 18:31.650
Ahem.

18:31.727 --> 18:33.718
Anybody care for a drink?

18:33.796 --> 18:35.730
Shit. Shit.

18:35.798 --> 18:38.562
Shit! Shit!
The world's shit!

18:38.634 --> 18:41.068
Shit! Shit!
Shit! Shit! Shit!

18:44.340 --> 18:47.002
Shit.

18:47.076 --> 18:49.840
Oh, God. Ma'am, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. I...

18:51.147 --> 18:52.580
Oh, God.

18:52.648 --> 18:53.580
Oh, shit.

18:53.649 --> 18:55.082
Oh, God. Okay.

18:55.151 --> 18:56.209
Okay.

18:56.285 --> 18:57.582
Okay. Okay. Okay.

19:03.125 --> 19:07.425
Well, Mercer told me to tell you,
"Welcome to the team."

19:07.496 --> 19:09.293
What team?

19:09.365 --> 19:12.857
Uh, team Gulden's.
The Gulden's team.

19:12.935 --> 19:16.098
But I don't have a husband,
and I don't have a mortgage,

19:16.172 --> 19:19.369
and I don't have a car
manufactured by a goddamn Nazi.

19:19.442 --> 19:21.603
Oh, jeez,
wait a second.

19:21.677 --> 19:25.272
You mean you're not
engaged to this guy?

19:25.348 --> 19:27.248
Oh, what are you
talking about?

19:27.316 --> 19:29.045
Darcy,
what did you do?

19:29.118 --> 19:31.143
What did you do?
What did you do?!

19:31.220 --> 19:32.619
Me? Nothing much.

19:32.688 --> 19:35.384
I just got you 150 more a week
and a new job title.

19:35.458 --> 19:36.925
You lied?!

19:36.993 --> 19:38.790
Darcy, I earned
that promotion!

19:38.861 --> 19:40.294
I deserved
that promotion.

19:40.363 --> 19:42.297
Boy, are you in
the wrong profession.

19:42.365 --> 19:44.595
We're in advertising, Kate.
I didn't lie. I sold.

19:44.667 --> 19:46.498
Oh, God,
I got to sit down.

19:46.569 --> 19:48.867
I told him you were too proud
to mention it yourself.

19:48.938 --> 19:51.133
They all said they want
to meet him, of course.

19:51.207 --> 19:52.799
Oh, great. Oh, my God.

19:52.875 --> 19:55.400
That's my first chest pain.
That's my first official chest pain.

19:55.478 --> 19:56.809
Oh, relax.

19:56.879 --> 19:59.848
I mean, they don't really.
And by the way, if anyone asks,

19:59.915 --> 20:02.850
he lives in Boston, and he flies in
every Friday on the shuttle.

20:02.918 --> 20:04.351
Oh, Darcy!

20:04.420 --> 20:07.321
Well, he has to.
You're house hunting.

20:07.390 --> 20:10.416
House hunting? I'm not even
married to the guy yet.

20:10.493 --> 20:13.690
You will be... in March.
You wanted a spring wedding.

20:13.763 --> 20:15.390
And also, I figure
it gives you 9 months

20:15.464 --> 20:17.091
until you have
to break it off.

20:17.166 --> 20:19.293
And who knows? I could throw you
a little shower.

20:19.368 --> 20:21.427
You could score
some pretty nice gifts.

20:21.504 --> 20:24.200
God, I can't believe you did this to me.
To me, your friend.

20:24.273 --> 20:26.173
Well, excuse me
for changing your life.

20:26.242 --> 20:28.403
I didn't do it to you,
I did it for you.

20:28.477 --> 20:30.604
And only because I knew you'd never
work up the courage

20:30.680 --> 20:32.307
to do it for yourself.

20:32.381 --> 20:34.349
Courage? To what?
To lie?

20:34.417 --> 20:36.942
What about my work?
What about my talent?

20:37.019 --> 20:38.452
What about my-

20:38.521 --> 20:39.954
What about
your integrity?

20:40.022 --> 20:42.616
Your Girl Scout
code of ethics?

20:42.692 --> 20:44.159
What?

20:44.226 --> 20:47.127
Kate, you are a director of creative
affairs at Mercer Advertising.

20:47.196 --> 20:49.790
I told a little fib
to get you the gig.

20:49.865 --> 20:51.127
So what?

20:51.200 --> 20:53.862
That doesn't change
the fact that you deserve it.

20:58.708 --> 21:00.073
Oh, by the way,

21:00.142 --> 21:02.372
there's a reception for
the Gulden's people tomorrow night,

21:02.445 --> 21:04.538
and Mercer asked me
to ask you to be there.

21:04.613 --> 21:08.276
He also asked me
if you owned any nice dresses

21:08.350 --> 21:10.648
he hadn't already
seen at work.

21:10.720 --> 21:12.153
What does that mean?

21:12.221 --> 21:14.587
It means
buy a new dress, Kate.

21:23.666 --> 21:24.963
What?

21:28.170 --> 21:30.035
Hey, hey, hey!
Congratulations!

21:30.106 --> 21:32.472
Congratulations,
congratulations!

21:32.541 --> 21:34.941
Oh, thank you.
Yeah, thank you.

21:35.010 --> 21:37.240
Hey, Jesus Christ, Kate.
You know, you're breaking my heart.

21:37.313 --> 21:38.746
I never even
got my shot.

21:38.814 --> 21:39.872
Oh, come on.
You're married.

21:39.949 --> 21:41.644
I would have left her for you.
You know that.

21:41.717 --> 21:43.344
So what
does he do?

21:43.419 --> 21:44.818
Um... videos.

21:44.887 --> 21:48.015
What do you mean?
Like, music videos?

21:48.090 --> 21:51.116
Yeah, sure.
Sometimes there's music in them.

21:51.193 --> 21:53.126
Really?

21:53.195 --> 21:54.457
Wow.
So happy for you.

21:54.530 --> 21:55.656
I'm happier.

21:55.731 --> 21:57.926
Thank you. That's
very nice, you guys.

21:58.000 --> 22:00.230
Okay, I'll see you later.
I'm a little late.

22:00.302 --> 22:01.530
Videos. Crap.

22:01.604 --> 22:02.866
I give them two years.

22:02.938 --> 22:04.200
18 months, tops.

22:16.652 --> 22:19.587
Now, it's a fruitful acre...

22:21.957 --> 22:24.858
Gotto cross
the mighty river

22:24.927 --> 22:27.122
And you got
to get along

22:27.196 --> 22:28.925
And I'm singing

22:28.998 --> 22:33.935
Oh, I got to keep
from goin' down

22:34.003 --> 22:38.963
Oh, though I don't know
where I'm bound

22:39.041 --> 22:50.011
It's too late
to turn back around

22:51.187 --> 22:52.916
Hey!

22:52.988 --> 22:54.785
Ah! Wow!

22:54.857 --> 22:56.620
Have my baby?

22:56.692 --> 22:59.183
Okay. Something happened,
though, between the store and here.

22:59.261 --> 23:01.024
I really-
I had more dress.

23:01.096 --> 23:03.621
Believe me, the part that's left
looks amazing.

23:03.699 --> 23:05.360
Really? Oh, good.

23:05.434 --> 23:06.366
Well... cheers.

23:06.435 --> 23:07.868
Oh, thank you.

23:07.937 --> 23:09.529
Have fun.
You look beautiful.

23:09.605 --> 23:11.129
Thank you. So do you.

23:11.207 --> 23:12.697
Mingle. Mingle.

23:12.775 --> 23:14.402
I will. Whoop. Big mustard
right behind you.

23:14.476 --> 23:15.500
Bye.

23:16.745 --> 23:17.939
Oh...

23:26.155 --> 23:28.589
Jim Davenport,
Katherine Mosley.

23:28.657 --> 23:29.817
Miss Mosley.

23:29.892 --> 23:31.154
Hello.

23:31.227 --> 23:33.388
Saw you walking across the room
in that fabulous dress.

23:33.462 --> 23:35.396
I asked Alan and
Sela who you were.

23:35.464 --> 23:37.591
They tell me you're the author
of this wonderful catch phrase

23:37.666 --> 23:39.600
we'll be using
in our new campaign.

23:39.668 --> 23:41.602
Oh, well.
Now, we work as a team,

23:41.670 --> 23:43.160
and Sela is actually
our team leader.

23:43.239 --> 23:44.206
I'm just,
you know...

23:44.273 --> 23:45.433
Tell her yours.

23:45.507 --> 23:47.065
Jim's come up with an idea
for another campaign,

23:47.142 --> 23:48.575
something we can
use down the road.

23:48.644 --> 23:50.111
Great.

23:50.179 --> 23:53.307
Well, just imagine
a big bowl of mustard...

23:53.382 --> 23:55.043
Gulden's mustard...

23:55.117 --> 23:57.244
and a model...
a beautiful model.

23:57.319 --> 23:59.014
And she's behind
the bowl of mustard...

23:59.088 --> 24:00.851
and I don't know if she
has to be nude or not.

24:00.923 --> 24:02.891
I mean, maybe she wouldn't
actually have to be nude,

24:02.958 --> 24:04.949
but because of the way
the bowl is in the picture

24:05.027 --> 24:07.052
and given the parts of the model
you would actually see,

24:07.129 --> 24:09.029
she would appear
to be nude.

24:09.098 --> 24:11.157
We'll leave
the technical stuff to you.

24:11.233 --> 24:14.327
Anyway, you've got this model
and a bowl of mustard,

24:14.403 --> 24:17.463
and in big letters across the top
of the picture

24:17.539 --> 24:19.803
are just the words,
"Spread this."

24:22.044 --> 24:23.511
"Spread this."
I mean...

24:23.579 --> 24:25.171
What do you think?

24:29.985 --> 24:31.282
Um...

24:31.353 --> 24:32.684
I like it...

24:32.755 --> 24:34.586
because it has
so many meanings.

24:34.657 --> 24:37.285
Yeah. I mean,
can't you just see it?

24:37.359 --> 24:40.328
In dorm rooms, posters,
on bumper stickers...

24:40.396 --> 24:42.557
Yeah, I sure-
I sure can.

24:42.631 --> 24:44.098
Ha ha!

24:44.166 --> 24:45.656
Oh, I mean,
you know...

24:45.734 --> 24:47.929
I hear something
like that,

24:48.003 --> 24:51.962
and I actually... I actually
have a physical reaction.

24:52.041 --> 24:54.601
I mean, you know,

24:54.677 --> 24:58.078
how often can you say that
nowadays, you know?

24:58.147 --> 24:59.978
Not very damn often!

25:00.049 --> 25:01.641
Nope!

25:01.717 --> 25:04.686
Excuse me, please.
Pleasure to meet you.

25:05.788 --> 25:07.119
Well...

25:07.189 --> 25:09.384
She is terrific!

25:44.660 --> 25:46.059
So, what's different?

25:47.363 --> 25:50.423
It's... It's the dress,
I'm telling you.

25:50.499 --> 25:53.195
No, it's not just the dress.
It's something else.

25:53.268 --> 25:54.292
It's...

25:54.370 --> 25:56.133
I don't know.
Success?

25:56.205 --> 25:59.663
Or... it's like some part of you
that I've never seen before.

25:59.742 --> 26:01.539
Aren't we going
to get in trouble...

26:01.610 --> 26:03.441
I mean, leaving
the party like we did?

26:03.512 --> 26:05.503
Oh, nobody's ever going to notice.
Are you kidding?

26:05.581 --> 26:07.481
The big guys are
all hammered anyway.

26:07.549 --> 26:09.540
The working stiffs
will be leaving soon

26:09.618 --> 26:11.552
to catch the 9:31
to Syosset.

26:11.620 --> 26:13.053
Ha ha!

26:19.628 --> 26:21.152
I like you.

26:25.134 --> 26:26.396
Um...

26:28.137 --> 26:30.401
Okay.

26:32.307 --> 26:34.138
Oh, oh. This isn't me.

26:34.209 --> 26:36.473
I don't normally do this.
I don't know...

26:36.545 --> 26:38.945
I don't know if it's the wine,
maybe, or if it's the beer,

26:39.014 --> 26:40.072
or it's...

26:40.149 --> 26:41.946
Me?

26:43.152 --> 26:44.813
Maybe.

26:55.664 --> 27:00.260
So, uh... so tell me
about this guy.

27:01.603 --> 27:02.570
Huh?

27:04.606 --> 27:06.039
The guy.

27:06.108 --> 27:08.542
You know, the guy
in the picture.

27:08.610 --> 27:10.407
I know all about him.

27:12.314 --> 27:15.477
You are a bad girl.

27:26.095 --> 27:28.461
Hi, Mom? It's me.

27:31.133 --> 27:32.566
It's Kate.

27:32.634 --> 27:36.126
No. I just wanted
to call you for a change.

27:36.205 --> 27:37.137
Look...

27:39.141 --> 27:41.575
- Whispering?
- I'm not whispering.

27:43.645 --> 27:45.237
Nice work. Good.

27:47.149 --> 27:48.081
In here.

27:48.150 --> 27:49.082
Si.

27:58.160 --> 27:59.718
Nice view.

28:02.831 --> 28:04.298
Hi there.

28:04.366 --> 28:05.697
Bad time?

28:05.767 --> 28:07.098
No.

28:07.169 --> 28:10.605
Um... guys, could I just
have one minute, please?

28:10.672 --> 28:12.105
Thank you.

28:22.618 --> 28:25.314
So I woke up this morning,
and you were gone,

28:25.387 --> 28:28.049
and it occurred to me
that I may have done

28:28.123 --> 28:30.023
a really shitty
thing here.

28:30.092 --> 28:31.525
What do you mean?

28:31.593 --> 28:35.757
Well, I knew that you were involved
with this other person. Uh...

28:37.132 --> 28:39.692
Nick. Yeah.

28:39.768 --> 28:41.702
I'm supposed to be
your friend here.

28:41.770 --> 28:43.601
I feel-I feel
responsible.

28:43.672 --> 28:46.197
Listen, Sam... I mean,
don't beat yourself up

28:46.275 --> 28:48.266
about this whole thing,
you know?

28:48.343 --> 28:50.072
I mean, I'm a big girl.

28:50.145 --> 28:51.169
I know.

28:51.246 --> 28:52.213
You know?

28:53.649 --> 28:55.207
So what are we
going to do?

28:55.284 --> 28:56.717
- About?
- Nick.

28:56.785 --> 28:57.717
Oh.

28:59.154 --> 29:01.918
Yeah. Um... I don't know.
I don't know.

29:01.990 --> 29:04.788
What do you think
we should do?

29:04.860 --> 29:07.294
Well, a lot of people
would tell you

29:07.362 --> 29:09.387
to be honest,
confess everything.

29:09.464 --> 29:11.455
I've had a lot of
experience with this.

29:11.533 --> 29:12.966
I think
that's just cruel.

29:13.035 --> 29:14.832
I mean, what good
is going to come of it?

29:14.903 --> 29:16.734
You're only going to
hurt someone's feelings.

29:16.805 --> 29:18.602
You can't take
the moment back.

29:18.674 --> 29:20.505
It's not like you can
turn back the clock.

29:20.576 --> 29:24.068
And it's... It's not like it's ever
going to happen again.

29:24.146 --> 29:25.773
Really?

29:28.116 --> 29:29.879
I mean, yeah. No.

29:29.952 --> 29:31.715
Yes, I know. No.

29:31.787 --> 29:33.220
Right.

29:33.288 --> 29:37.190
So maybe the less
Nick knows, the better.

29:37.259 --> 29:41.696
Yeah, yeah. I would- I think
I would be of that mind. Mm-hmm.

29:41.763 --> 29:42.923
Good.

29:42.998 --> 29:44.158
- Yeah. Great.
- Great.

29:44.233 --> 29:45.757
- Good.
- Great.

29:47.636 --> 29:48.830
Great.

29:53.075 --> 29:55.009
Have you ever been
to a tennis tournament?

29:55.077 --> 29:56.977
'Cause I got these two
tickets this weekend.

29:57.045 --> 29:59.013
I mean, purely as a friend thing,
if you wanted to-

29:59.081 --> 30:01.106
Well, that's-

30:01.183 --> 30:03.083
That's very sweet, Sam,

30:03.151 --> 30:05.676
and I would love to,
as a friend thing,

30:05.754 --> 30:08.518
but, uh, you see,
the thing is...

30:08.590 --> 30:11.218
Nick's coming
into town this weekend.

30:11.293 --> 30:12.692
Right, right, right.

30:12.761 --> 30:14.092
Right, okay.

30:14.162 --> 30:15.220
Right.

30:16.898 --> 30:17.956
Hey.

30:18.033 --> 30:19.091
Yeah.

30:19.167 --> 30:20.759
Nick's a lucky guy.

30:20.836 --> 30:22.030
You think so?

30:22.104 --> 30:23.594
I do.

30:30.045 --> 30:31.569
Oh...

30:31.647 --> 30:32.978
God.

30:48.697 --> 30:50.130
Oh! Ma!
Jesus F-ing Christ!

30:50.198 --> 30:51.631
I did not go through
3 hours of labor-

30:51.700 --> 30:53.133
not to mention 81/2 years
with your father-

30:53.201 --> 30:54.634
Why do you
do this to me?

30:54.703 --> 30:56.136
So that I could spend
my days worrying...

30:56.204 --> 30:57.796
Can't I just
put my stuff down?

30:57.873 --> 30:59.033
Whether my daughter was lying in
some ditch somewhere or something worse!

30:59.107 --> 31:00.301
Ditch?! Mom,
listen to yourself!

31:00.375 --> 31:01.967
There are no goddamn
ditches in New York!

31:02.044 --> 31:04.171
Don't you raise
your voice to me, young lady!

31:04.246 --> 31:06.612
You want all
the neighbors to hear?

31:06.682 --> 31:09.845
My neighbors, Mother. This is
my apartment. What are you doing here?

31:09.918 --> 31:11.579
Let me ask you
a question.

31:11.653 --> 31:13.086
No! You answer
my question!

31:13.155 --> 31:15.089
Do I look stupid
to you?

31:15.157 --> 31:16.988
Stup-what? What is that
supposed to mean, Ma?

31:17.059 --> 31:18.583
"Hi, Mom.
It's me, Kate.

31:18.660 --> 31:20.355
I just thought I'd call you
this morning for a change."

31:20.429 --> 31:21.862
Check your
answering machine.

31:21.930 --> 31:25.127
The moment we hung up,
I called you back.

31:25.200 --> 31:29.102
You weren't here. 7 times I tried.
7 times, young lady!

31:29.171 --> 31:31.105
So what?
No TV for a week?

31:31.173 --> 31:32.936
Then I phoned
the office,

31:33.008 --> 31:34.600
but apparently
Miss Big Shot

31:34.676 --> 31:36.610
was too busy to call
her mother back!

31:36.678 --> 31:39.112
Okay, you know what, though?
I'm here now, and I'm fine.

31:39.181 --> 31:40.648
Well, I'm not!

31:40.716 --> 31:42.684
And I want to know
where you were this morning!

31:42.751 --> 31:43.843
I have a right
to know!

31:43.919 --> 31:45.409
No, you do not
have a right!

31:45.487 --> 31:46.419
You have no right,
Mother!

31:46.488 --> 31:47.819
I am 28 years old!

31:47.889 --> 31:50.221
Don't give me that.
I'm 54. I'm gonna be dead soon!

31:50.292 --> 31:51.452
Oh, God!

31:51.526 --> 31:52.686
Where are you going?

31:52.761 --> 31:54.126
To kill myself!

31:54.196 --> 31:55.322
No, no. Not until
you tell me

31:55.397 --> 31:57.627
where you were
this morning. No.

32:03.138 --> 32:06.471
All right, Mom.
I was with a man.

32:06.541 --> 32:10.068
I was with a really
beautiful man...

32:12.714 --> 32:14.648
who,
up until last night,

32:14.716 --> 32:16.183
never even noticed me.

32:16.251 --> 32:20.244
And then all of a sudden
he wanted to be with me,

32:20.322 --> 32:23.223
and I really wanted
to be with him...

32:23.291 --> 32:24.690
so we slept together.

32:24.760 --> 32:28.594
We had sex, Mommy,
you know?

32:28.663 --> 32:30.597
The really dirty kind.

32:32.601 --> 32:35.069
And I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, Mommy...

32:36.304 --> 32:39.535
But that's where I was.

32:40.742 --> 32:42.334
Oh, Kate.

32:44.179 --> 32:46.613
Now, that's enough
of that, hmm?

32:49.451 --> 32:51.612
Tell me the truth now.

32:53.355 --> 32:54.947
Oh, God.

32:55.023 --> 32:56.259
Mmm.

32:56.392 --> 32:58.189
And you know, the thing
that really kills me

32:58.261 --> 33:01.594
is she loved the lie so much better
than she liked the truth.

33:01.664 --> 33:03.825
I mean, even when I had to fudge
a little bit, you know?

33:03.899 --> 33:05.127
"So, uh,
what does he do? '

33:05.201 --> 33:07.066
"Well, he owns
his own business."

33:07.136 --> 33:08.603
"Well, can I meet him
this weekend? '

33:08.671 --> 33:11.196
"Nope. We're going
ring shopping in Boston."

33:11.274 --> 33:12.502
Oh! Ring shopping.

33:12.575 --> 33:13.633
Yeah.

33:13.709 --> 33:14.767
Oh, you're really getting
the hang of this.

33:14.844 --> 33:17.711
I know. Well, it gets
easier once you realize

33:17.780 --> 33:20.078
that's what everybody
wants you to do.

33:20.149 --> 33:23.550
Hi. Could I have the number for
Midtown Flowers, please?

33:23.619 --> 33:25.143
What are you doing?

33:25.221 --> 33:26.586
Ha ha! Thank you.

33:26.656 --> 33:30.717
Okay. "Press one
to connect this call."

33:30.793 --> 33:34.285
Yes, hi. I need to send
a huge bouquet

33:34.363 --> 33:39.460
to Katherine Mosley at Mercer
Advertising Agency. 555-96...

33:39.535 --> 33:40.763
Donna Summer: Bad girl

33:40.836 --> 33:42.463
Backup Singers: Bad girl

33:42.538 --> 33:45.234
Talkin' 'bout bad,
bad girls

33:45.308 --> 33:47.242
Yeah

33:47.310 --> 33:48.242
Bad girl

33:48.311 --> 33:49.335
You bad girl

33:49.412 --> 33:51.346
You're such
a dirty bad girl

33:51.414 --> 33:52.642
Beep beep

33:52.715 --> 33:55.240
Uh-huh

33:55.318 --> 33:56.285
Hey, mister

33:57.386 --> 33:58.478
Beep beep

33:58.554 --> 34:00.920
Have you got a dime?

34:00.990 --> 34:03.481
Beep beep

34:03.559 --> 34:04.719
Mister

34:04.794 --> 34:06.056
Beep beep

34:06.128 --> 34:08.062
Do you want to
spend some time

34:08.130 --> 34:09.062
Oh, yeah

34:09.130 --> 34:11.065
Beep beep

34:11.132 --> 34:12.121
Toot toot

34:12.201 --> 34:13.031
Hey, mister

34:13.101 --> 34:14.159
Beep beep

34:14.235 --> 34:16.931
I'll spend some time
with you

34:17.005 --> 34:18.871
Beep beep

34:18.940 --> 34:20.067
Can you...

34:22.645 --> 34:26.081
Hey, get your
hands off my stems.

34:26.148 --> 34:28.342
I've been waiting years
to use that line.

34:28.417 --> 34:29.440
So, what's
the occasion?

34:29.518 --> 34:31.645
Oh, come on, Sam.
You're smarter than that.

34:31.721 --> 34:35.521
You know there's only two reasons
why a man sends a woman flowers.

34:35.591 --> 34:37.320
I love it when I can
learn something new.

34:37.393 --> 34:39.485
Well, either
they've let you down,

34:39.562 --> 34:40.995
or they're about to.

34:41.063 --> 34:42.360
Nick?

34:42.431 --> 34:43.830
Mm-hmm.

34:43.899 --> 34:45.799
Nothing fatal,
I hope.

34:45.868 --> 34:48.701
No. He just has to
work this weekend.

34:49.772 --> 34:50.704
Ambition.

34:50.773 --> 34:52.797
I hate that
in a man.

34:56.679 --> 34:58.408
Now, I'm quiet

34:58.481 --> 35:01.245
Quiet as a mouse could be

35:01.317 --> 35:03.308
But inside my head

35:03.386 --> 35:06.355
It's louder than a cavalry

35:06.422 --> 35:08.413
And I'm patient

35:08.491 --> 35:11.187
Patient as a clock

35:11.260 --> 35:13.558
It is to feel the way

35:13.629 --> 35:15.790
When you're countin'
every tick and tock

35:15.865 --> 35:20.063
Show me how to
catch a fish

35:20.136 --> 35:23.367
Show

35:25.107 --> 35:27.632
Thanks for walking me
up here, Sam.

35:27.710 --> 35:28.642
No problem.

35:28.711 --> 35:29.939
Oh, God,
I really had fun.

35:30.012 --> 35:31.570
I did.
I- you, uh...

35:31.647 --> 35:34.582
You really took
my mind off Nick.

35:34.650 --> 35:38.552
Aw, come on.
We both know there is no Nick.

35:38.621 --> 35:40.987
There certainly
is a Nick.

35:41.056 --> 35:42.921
Not here.
Not now.

35:44.827 --> 35:46.351
What are you doing?

35:46.429 --> 35:49.091
This is called
mounting an offensive.

35:49.165 --> 35:50.689
Okay. Come on.

35:50.766 --> 35:52.597
Now, we know nobody's gonna be
mounting anybody around here.

35:52.668 --> 35:54.431
You're right. You're right.
Right. I'm sorry.

35:54.503 --> 35:55.527
All right?

35:55.604 --> 35:57.071
Can I just come in
for a glass of water?

35:57.139 --> 35:58.401
No.

35:58.474 --> 35:59.805
Well, can I come in
and pee?

35:59.875 --> 36:02.343
You just said you wanted
a glass of water.

36:02.411 --> 36:03.605
Oh, what can I say?

36:03.679 --> 36:05.874
The thought of drinking water
makes me have to pee.

36:05.948 --> 36:06.937
Come on.

36:07.016 --> 36:10.713
Sam, we have had
this conversation, okay?

36:10.786 --> 36:13.084
I'm engaged
to be married.

36:13.155 --> 36:14.884
We made this
mistake once.

36:14.957 --> 36:17.687
I cannot do it again.
I can't.

36:17.760 --> 36:23.392
You know, I mean, God.
You know I like you. I can't deny that.

36:23.466 --> 36:26.629
But my heart
belongs to Nick.

36:26.702 --> 36:28.567
Okay?

36:28.637 --> 36:31.972
Okay.

36:32.041 --> 36:33.235
Thank you.

36:39.315 --> 36:40.304
Okay.

36:42.017 --> 36:43.507
Good night.

36:54.163 --> 36:56.222
Oh, there's steps,
there's steps, there's steps.

36:56.298 --> 36:58.425
It's over here.
Over here. Bedroom.

37:00.002 --> 37:02.835
Wow! Is this place
rent controlled?

37:02.905 --> 37:04.031
Ah!

37:10.946 --> 37:12.345
God,
you can't stay, Sam.

37:12.414 --> 37:13.540
Nick's gonna
call soon.

37:13.616 --> 37:15.015
I can be quiet.

37:15.084 --> 37:17.712
I can be really,
really quiet.

37:20.456 --> 37:23.425
The door.
I think you left the door open.

37:23.492 --> 37:25.050
No problem.

37:25.127 --> 37:30.622
Oh, I don't know, Sam.
It just feels wrong, you know?

37:30.699 --> 37:32.291
It just feels
really, really wrong.

37:32.368 --> 37:34.063
Ah!

37:34.136 --> 37:35.933
Well, good.

37:36.005 --> 37:37.939
'Cause that's
the feeling...

37:38.007 --> 37:39.406
that you feel...

37:39.475 --> 37:41.568
right before...

37:41.644 --> 37:44.704
it feels incredible.

37:56.158 --> 37:57.591
You know,

37:57.660 --> 38:03.792
normally this would be
about the time that I'd leave.

38:03.866 --> 38:06.357
Most of the women
I get involved with

38:06.435 --> 38:09.529
are either married
or have a boyfriend.

38:09.605 --> 38:13.041
It's always seemed to
work pretty well for me.

38:13.108 --> 38:15.542
You know,
the thing with that is

38:15.611 --> 38:18.341
that you always kind of
feel them looking past you,

38:18.414 --> 38:21.542
trying to steal
a glimpse of the clock

38:21.617 --> 38:25.553
or listening for a voice
on the answering machine.

38:25.621 --> 38:27.054
But you...

38:29.858 --> 38:32.827
I don't know.

38:32.895 --> 38:36.831
It's like,
even though you're engaged,

38:36.899 --> 38:40.027
when you're with me,

38:40.102 --> 38:43.071
I really feel like
you're with me, you know?

38:45.641 --> 38:48.576
You know what
the scary thing is?

38:48.644 --> 38:51.078
I actually
kind of like it.

38:57.152 --> 38:58.585
Are you asleep?

39:02.424 --> 39:03.356
Fabulous.

39:03.425 --> 39:05.017
My reputation
remains intact.

39:06.795 --> 39:08.956
Now, let me see
if I've got your story straight.

39:09.131 --> 39:12.965
It's Sunday night, you're
videotaping an out-of-town wedding,

39:13.035 --> 39:15.970
when suddenly
a fire alarm goes off.

39:16.038 --> 39:17.232
Everyone's evacuating,
but as you leave,

39:17.306 --> 39:19.297
you hear what sounds
like a child crying.

39:19.375 --> 39:22.242
You find a 6-year-old girl
by the vending machines.

39:22.311 --> 39:24.609
Now, you realize you're about to be
engulfed by flames.

39:24.680 --> 39:27.012
So you take a chair.
You smash it through the window.

39:27.082 --> 39:29.175
With no firemen,
no nets below,

39:29.251 --> 39:32.118
you grab this little girl
and jump backwards out the window.

39:32.187 --> 39:33.484
Now, why backwards?

39:33.555 --> 39:35.819
Second I was hoping my body
would break her fall.

39:35.891 --> 39:37.552
What are you thinking
at that point?

39:37.626 --> 39:39.594
Well, honestly, I was thinking
I should get back inside,

39:39.662 --> 39:42.028
'Cause the bunny hop
was coming up...

39:42.097 --> 39:43.655
Aah!

39:43.732 --> 39:45.700
Well, you must-

39:45.768 --> 39:47.133
What?
What's up?

39:47.202 --> 39:48.567
...I mean, if an awning
broke my fall from 3 floors up.

39:48.637 --> 39:50.036
And the little girl?

39:50.105 --> 39:52.164
Oh, she's fine.
There's not a scratch on her.

39:52.241 --> 39:54.539
Hey, isn't
that your guy? Isn't that Nick?

39:54.610 --> 39:55.736
Uh-huh.

39:55.811 --> 39:58.371
Huh. Well, I guess we know
why he never called.

39:58.447 --> 39:59.607
All right, Nick.

39:59.682 --> 40:00.740
Thank you very much
for joining us this morning.

40:26.809 --> 40:29.107
Hey, Kate, I saw
your boyfriend on TV this morning.

40:29.178 --> 40:30.509
Hey, hey,
how about that?

40:30.579 --> 40:32.740
Also, your mother's
called 4 times already.

40:32.815 --> 40:33.907
Ah, I bet she has.

40:39.321 --> 40:41.755
Oh, well,
look at the bright side.

40:41.824 --> 40:43.291
At least he didn't make
the New York Times.

40:43.358 --> 40:44.916
Yeah, right.
What the hell are we going to do?

40:44.993 --> 40:46.153
You okay?

40:46.228 --> 40:47.320
Uh-huh.

40:47.396 --> 40:48.090
Is he okay?

40:48.163 --> 40:49.130
Yeah.

40:49.198 --> 40:51.359
Of course he's okay.
He's on television.

40:51.433 --> 40:53.799
You know, I was just talking
to Davenport over at Gulden's,

40:53.869 --> 40:56.565
and when I told him that this guy
was your guy, well...

40:56.638 --> 40:58.765
We'd like to take
you two kids out to dinner,

40:58.841 --> 41:00.069
just the 6 of us.

41:01.310 --> 41:03.938
You got a cough,
Darcy? The 8 of us.

41:04.012 --> 41:06.378
Uh, Mr. Mercer,
the thing is,

41:06.448 --> 41:08.211
he lives in Massachusetts.

41:08.283 --> 41:09.409
Well, I'm not
talking about tonight.

41:09.485 --> 41:11.612
You know, this weekend
or early next week.

41:11.687 --> 41:14.622
It would really
mean the world to Davenport.

41:16.158 --> 41:17.591
Ah...

41:17.659 --> 41:20.321
Thank you for calling
Times Of Your Life Video.

41:20.395 --> 41:22.795
This is Nick. I'm not here
to take your call right now,

41:22.865 --> 41:25.026
but if you tell this machine who
you are and how to reach you,

41:25.100 --> 41:26.897
I promise to call you back.

41:27.970 --> 41:29.597
Hi.
This is Kate Mosley.

41:29.671 --> 41:31.832
We met at Susan
and Sajit's wedding.

41:31.907 --> 41:34.842
I'm the girl who caught-
No. Wait.

41:34.910 --> 41:36.275
I was actually handed
the bouquet, remember?

41:36.345 --> 41:37.903
Anyway, I got
your number from Susan,

41:37.980 --> 41:41.347
and I was wondering if I could
buy you a cup of coffee.

41:41.416 --> 41:43.316
You name the place.
I'll come to you.

41:43.385 --> 41:45.478
I'd appreciate it if you'd
call me back either way.

41:45.554 --> 41:46.680
Bye.

41:52.027 --> 41:53.961
Hey, how are you?

41:54.029 --> 41:55.018
Good job.

41:55.097 --> 41:56.530
That was
really wonderful.

41:56.598 --> 41:57.530
Great job.

41:57.599 --> 41:58.531
Thank you very much.

41:58.600 --> 41:59.532
Hi.

41:59.601 --> 42:00.659
Hi.

42:00.736 --> 42:02.829
Wow! They really love you
around here, huh?

42:02.905 --> 42:06.068
Oh, yeah.
My public thing.

42:06.141 --> 42:08.371
Uh-huh.

42:08.443 --> 42:09.467
Thank you.

42:09.545 --> 42:10.477
Thanks, Lois.

42:10.546 --> 42:11.774
Um...

42:15.350 --> 42:18.148
I've done a really-
I've done a really horrible thing.

42:18.220 --> 42:21.314
Wha-you know,
I find that hard to believe.

42:21.390 --> 42:23.881
Well, um...

42:23.959 --> 42:26.894
See, a friend of mine
found a picture

42:26.962 --> 42:30.864
of the two of us
from the wedding, you know,

42:30.933 --> 42:34.369
and basically led a lot
of people to believe

42:34.436 --> 42:36.870
that you and I
were basically...

42:36.939 --> 42:38.099
What?

42:39.675 --> 42:43.111
Uh, engaged,
actually.

42:43.178 --> 42:47.114
Yeah. And, uh, I didn't
really do or say much

42:47.182 --> 42:49.116
to let them
think otherwise.

42:49.184 --> 42:51.744
What do you
think so far?

42:53.055 --> 42:55.114
Uh... so far?

42:55.190 --> 42:58.318
Uh, I-I'm flattered,
I think.

43:00.128 --> 43:04.929
Okay, well, see, it was going well,
for a while, you know,

43:05.000 --> 43:09.903
and, uh, then you went
and you got famous on me.

43:09.972 --> 43:12.873
I'd, uh...
Oh, God. Oh, God.

43:12.941 --> 43:14.374
Wow. This is-

43:14.443 --> 43:17.378
This is just so embarrassing
and humiliating.

43:17.446 --> 43:19.744
What, uh, what did
you come here to ask me?

43:19.815 --> 43:21.180
All right.

43:21.250 --> 43:24.981
All right,
it's a proposition, actually.

43:25.053 --> 43:27.954
I will pay you $ 1,000
if you will come to New York City

43:28.023 --> 43:30.355
and have dinner with me
and some people that I work with.

43:30.425 --> 43:31.790
I'll buy you
a plane ticket,

43:31.860 --> 43:33.122
I'll buy you a suit
if you need one.

43:33.195 --> 43:34.423
I don't want you
to feel like a thing.

43:34.496 --> 43:36.088
I mean, think of it as,
like, a paid vacation.

43:36.164 --> 43:37.597
You can stay with me.

43:37.666 --> 43:41.500
You know, you can't
work with that cast, right? And...

43:41.570 --> 43:43.663
Okay, so this
is the plan.

43:43.739 --> 43:46.503
Two-thirds of the way through the
dinner, you would pick a fight with me.

43:46.575 --> 43:49.635
And we would have,
like, a quarrel, right?

43:49.711 --> 43:50.939
And everybody would
watch us break up.

43:51.013 --> 43:52.981
You would never
have to see me again.

43:53.048 --> 43:54.948
And, you know,
there it is.

43:55.017 --> 43:56.780
Wow. That really
sounds like something

43:56.852 --> 43:59.548
right out of The Patty Duke Show,
doesn't it? Ha ha.

43:59.621 --> 44:00.952
Oh.

44:01.023 --> 44:03.321
You want to pay me
to have dinner with you?

44:07.996 --> 44:09.156
Yeah.

44:12.634 --> 44:14.568
Uh...

44:14.636 --> 44:16.160
I, uh...

44:16.238 --> 44:19.332
I don't, you know,
I don't want your money.

44:19.408 --> 44:20.807
Yeah.

44:20.876 --> 44:22.070
Okay.

44:22.144 --> 44:25.204
That's...
That's a no, right?

44:25.280 --> 44:26.770
See, the thing is,

44:26.848 --> 44:32.787
I was, uh, thinking
of coming to New York, you know...

44:32.854 --> 44:36.290
and, uh, you know, I was gonna
get your number from Susan

44:36.358 --> 44:42.092
and, uh, ask you if you wanted
to have dinner with me.

44:42.164 --> 44:47.124
So, yes. You, uh... Figure out
what night is best for you

44:47.202 --> 44:49.102
because I'm pretty
flexible, you know?

44:49.171 --> 44:51.901
So if you want to bring a friend
or people you work with,

44:51.974 --> 44:53.271
that's up to you,

44:53.342 --> 44:57.278
and it's good we ran into
each other again like this.

44:57.346 --> 44:59.906
So think about what I said, and I'll
give you a call tomorrow. Okay?

45:03.118 --> 45:05.086
Oh, uh, by the way...

45:05.153 --> 45:06.848
I do own a suit.

45:06.922 --> 45:09.356
Of course you do.

45:12.260 --> 45:13.625
And when I get that feeling

45:13.695 --> 45:14.957
See you.

45:15.030 --> 45:17.055
Tony, I'll see
you tonight.

45:17.132 --> 45:19.327
I can no longer run

45:19.401 --> 45:20.993
I don't know

45:21.069 --> 45:24.903
And when I get that feeling

45:27.743 --> 45:29.711
Ma, your color
looks so beautiful.

45:29.778 --> 45:31.211
Never mind that.

45:31.279 --> 45:33.747
What I don't
understand is...

45:33.815 --> 45:35.510
He can come all
the way to New York

45:35.584 --> 45:37.381
just to meet the people
you work with,

45:37.452 --> 45:39.886
but he can't
find an hour

45:39.955 --> 45:42.981
to visit with his
future mother-in-law.

45:43.058 --> 45:45.549
Mom, he's busy, okay?
He's really busy.

45:45.627 --> 45:48.824
It's just gonna have to be
another trip, you know, another time.

45:48.897 --> 45:51.866
Are you lying to me?

45:51.933 --> 45:54.231
I embarrass you.

45:54.302 --> 45:55.234
Oh, Mom...

45:55.303 --> 45:56.600
Is that it?

45:56.671 --> 45:57.603
Mom, no, no.

45:57.672 --> 45:59.469
In fact,
you know what?

45:59.541 --> 46:01.907
I'm afraid he's
gonna come here,

46:01.977 --> 46:04.878
take one look at you,
and say to himself,

46:04.946 --> 46:09.042
"What the hell am I doing
marrying the junior version

46:09.117 --> 46:12.780
when the real thing
is still available? '

46:12.854 --> 46:15.288
I don't believe
a word of that,

46:15.357 --> 46:17.226
but I appreciate
the effort.

46:27.769 --> 46:29.202
But he won't.

46:29.271 --> 46:32.138
The key here that
you're missing is

46:32.207 --> 46:34.937
that the only mustard
he uses is Gulden's.

46:35.010 --> 46:37.501
Yeah, that's it.
That's it.

46:37.579 --> 46:40.070
Hi. Uh, yeah, okay,
so will you call-

46:40.148 --> 46:43.584
I gotto go, but will you
call me when you find him?

46:43.652 --> 46:44.710
Thank you very much.

46:44.786 --> 46:46.879
Ha! Hey!

46:46.955 --> 46:47.887
Hi!

46:47.956 --> 46:49.583
Hi! You're here.

46:49.658 --> 46:51.922
I'm supposed to meet you
at my apartment two hours from now.

46:51.994 --> 46:53.723
Yeah. I got
an earlier bus.

46:53.795 --> 46:55.228
Oh, did you?
Oh... oh.

46:55.297 --> 46:57.788
Yeah. It's good
to see you-

47:05.974 --> 47:08.306
I'm sorry, I didn't know we
were on the clock yet.

47:08.377 --> 47:11.369
Okay, just grab my ass, kiss my neck,
and pull me into the office, okay?

47:11.446 --> 47:12.879
Y- uh, y-yeah.

47:12.948 --> 47:13.573
Yes, sir.

47:13.649 --> 47:16.482
Whoo!
Ha ha ha!

47:18.287 --> 47:21.017
Je-sus!

47:21.089 --> 47:23.284
What is the world
coming to?

47:23.358 --> 47:26.816
Okay, so what I told people
is that we met in college,

47:26.895 --> 47:28.556
but we were
just friends

47:28.630 --> 47:30.825
and that we re-met at this
reunion thing, like, 5 years later.

47:30.899 --> 47:32.332
It was sort of like,

47:32.401 --> 47:33.868
I don't know, that's when the fire
really got ignited, you know?

47:33.935 --> 47:36.096
I kind of like that.
We meet. We meet again.

47:36.171 --> 47:39.197
That makes it more,
I don't know... believable.

47:39.274 --> 47:40.332
I wouldn't know.

47:40.409 --> 47:41.603
You went to college,
right?

47:41.677 --> 47:43.474
Yeah. Several.

47:43.545 --> 47:44.944
Hmm.

47:45.013 --> 47:47.846
Well, if anybody asks, just say
you went to Boston University,

47:47.916 --> 47:50.248
because that's where
I went, and everybody knows that.

47:50.319 --> 47:51.946
Maybe we should
say business.

47:52.020 --> 47:53.214
I majored
in business.

47:53.288 --> 47:55.017
I mean, I told everybody you own
your own business,

47:55.090 --> 47:56.114
you know,
the video thing,

47:56.191 --> 47:57.453
but I kind of fudged
about the wedding part.

47:57.526 --> 47:59.892
Maybe we should just let them
think it's music videos.

47:59.961 --> 48:01.656
It's more glamorous
and all that sort of stuff, anyway.

48:01.730 --> 48:02.754
Oh, you don't mind
that, do you?

48:02.831 --> 48:04.822
Actually, you know,
I do mind, 'cause-

48:04.900 --> 48:06.868
Oh! And I had
really long hair.

48:06.935 --> 48:08.800
In college I had
really long hair.

48:08.870 --> 48:11.202
And I was about 20
or so pounds heavier.

48:11.273 --> 48:13.298
But that's good.
That'll be good. You know why?

48:13.375 --> 48:15.275
Because you can say
it was the weight thing

48:15.344 --> 48:16.641
that kind of turned
your head around.

48:16.712 --> 48:18.043
That'll be good.

48:18.113 --> 48:19.671
Okay, now, this is
the bathroom,

48:19.748 --> 48:21.909
and I'll get you
some towels and stuff,

48:21.983 --> 48:23.143
and I'll let you know
which is yours.

48:23.218 --> 48:24.549
And then this
is the couch.

48:24.619 --> 48:25.916
This is where
you'll be sleeping.

48:25.987 --> 48:27.181
And I'll get you
some comfy pillows

48:27.255 --> 48:29.223
and some blankets
and sort of, you know-

48:29.291 --> 48:30.223
it should be nice-

48:31.293 --> 48:33.056
Oop, sorry.
Just a minute.

48:34.262 --> 48:35.559
Hello?

48:38.266 --> 48:40.860
Can you, uh,
hold on a second?

48:40.936 --> 48:43.564
Uh, Nick,
I'll be right back.

48:58.286 --> 49:01.687
Ha! I cannot believe
you are saying that.

49:04.793 --> 49:07.728
Okay, all right.
Look, I'll do it. Okay?

49:07.796 --> 49:09.764
But I cannot stay long.

49:09.831 --> 49:11.025
All right?

49:12.434 --> 49:14.026
Okay. Bye.

49:15.570 --> 49:17.231
Is everything okay?

49:17.305 --> 49:21.139
Um, yeah, I, uh-
Something just came up at work.

49:21.209 --> 49:25.009
I've gotto meet a colleague
for a drink, but I shouldn't be long.

49:34.856 --> 49:36.847
Hey!
Is this your mother?

49:36.925 --> 49:38.825
Uh, I don't know
what you're looking at.

49:38.894 --> 49:40.555
How about this picture
of a beautiful woman

49:40.629 --> 49:42.221
that looks just like you
but older.

49:42.297 --> 49:43.730
Is that your mother?

49:43.799 --> 49:45.232
Ha ha ha!

49:45.300 --> 49:45.959
Yes.

49:46.034 --> 49:47.626
That would be Mom.

49:47.702 --> 49:49.067
She's pretty.

49:54.643 --> 49:56.110
Whoo! Wow.

49:56.178 --> 49:57.907
Thanks.

49:57.979 --> 49:59.776
Okay, well, I shouldn't
be long, Nick.

49:59.848 --> 50:00.872
An hour, tops.

50:00.949 --> 50:02.314
Uh, I mean
I wouldn't even go,

50:02.384 --> 50:04.909
I mean, I know it's your first night
in a strange city.

50:04.986 --> 50:06.749
He just sounded
so panicked.

50:06.822 --> 50:08.380
He?

50:08.457 --> 50:10.049
Oh! I have
something for you.

50:10.125 --> 50:11.558
Oh.

50:16.631 --> 50:18.656
If you could look at this
while I'm gone,

50:18.733 --> 50:20.257
that would be great.

50:20.335 --> 50:22.064
Yeah. What is it?

50:22.137 --> 50:25.971
Well, it's sort of
a study guide, actually.

50:26.041 --> 50:28.874
It's, you know,
our life together.

50:28.944 --> 50:31.071
My hobbies,
my ex-boyfriends,

50:31.146 --> 50:34.775
uh, what happened to me
during the 5 years we were apart,

50:34.850 --> 50:36.875
our reunion, things I've said
to people about you...

50:36.952 --> 50:38.351
Wow! You've really
put a lot of work into this.

50:38.420 --> 50:39.682
Yeah.

50:39.754 --> 50:40.846
Well, it's my life.

50:40.922 --> 50:42.219
Sort of.

50:42.290 --> 50:45.259
Okay, and then
there's this.

50:45.327 --> 50:47.352
Oh, hey, the, uh...

50:47.429 --> 50:49.624
Yeah, this is the fight that we're
gonna have tomorrow night.

50:49.698 --> 50:52.633
Um, so I sort of-
I wrote it out like a play, so...

50:52.701 --> 50:54.635
Okay. "Look, I'm sorry, Kate,
but I can no longer accept that-"

50:54.703 --> 50:55.635
This is me, right?

50:55.704 --> 50:56.636
Yeah.

50:56.705 --> 50:58.138
"I'm sorry, Kate,
but I can no longer

50:58.206 --> 51:00.037
"accept the time and energy
you put into your work.

51:00.108 --> 51:01.473
"There has to be
something left for me.

51:01.543 --> 51:03.340
Every minute of every day
can't be about Mercer Advertising."

51:03.411 --> 51:04.708
Yeah. Right.

51:04.779 --> 51:07.407
So, you know, it doesn't have to be
verbatim, basically.

51:07.482 --> 51:09.279
I mean, you can put it
into your own words.

51:09.351 --> 51:11.512
Oh, oh, yeah.
I think I will.

51:11.586 --> 51:13.850
Great. No, but as long as you
get the basic point across,

51:13.922 --> 51:15.412
you know,
like you've had it.

51:15.490 --> 51:18.789
I'm always at work,
my mind is always on my work.

51:18.860 --> 51:20.418
So I thought that
would be sort of a nice touch,

51:20.495 --> 51:22.895
if our breakup sort of reaffirmed
my commitment to the firm.

51:22.964 --> 51:24.829
Well, yeah.
That sounds smart.

51:24.900 --> 51:28.097
Okay, great, so I'll be at this place
called Man Ray.

51:28.169 --> 51:31.002
It's in the phone book
if you need me,

51:31.072 --> 51:33.438
but I really- I should just
be an hour.

51:34.843 --> 51:36.902
Oh... thanks, Nick,

51:36.978 --> 51:41.108
for coming down here
and doing this.

52:01.102 --> 52:02.399
I'm really
embarrassed.

52:02.470 --> 52:04.802
I mean, I've been babbling
for what, like, two hours now?

52:04.873 --> 52:06.465
Oh, come on, Sam.
Don't be embarrassed.

52:06.541 --> 52:07.633
I don't usually
react this way.

52:07.709 --> 52:09.074
You were
kissing your fiancé.

52:09.144 --> 52:11.578
It's a perfectly normal thing
for you to be doing.

52:11.646 --> 52:13.841
I don't know why
it had such an effect on me.

52:13.915 --> 52:15.542
It's okay, Sam,
it's really okay.

52:15.617 --> 52:17.983
But you know what?
I did tell him an hour-

52:18.053 --> 52:18.917
How did he do it?

52:18.987 --> 52:20.079
What? Do what?

52:20.155 --> 52:22.089
Propose. I mean,
did he get down on one knee?

52:22.157 --> 52:23.419
What did he say?

52:23.491 --> 52:24.924
Oh...

52:24.993 --> 52:26.585
Oh, God.
I'm sorry.

52:26.661 --> 52:28.060
Why? For what?

52:28.129 --> 52:30.427
Well,
for the other night.

52:30.498 --> 52:33.934
And the other...
other night.

52:35.337 --> 52:36.599
Kate.

52:36.671 --> 52:37.603
Yeah?

52:39.040 --> 52:42.305
If I had
known you first...

52:42.377 --> 52:44.902
would it have
made a difference?

52:48.016 --> 52:49.449
Sam...

52:49.517 --> 52:52.315
Okay. I gotto
tell you something.

52:52.387 --> 52:53.354
Okay?

52:53.421 --> 52:57.118
It has to do with me
and, uh, Nick-

52:57.192 --> 52:58.625
Somebody
mention my name?

52:58.693 --> 53:00.092
Oh, my God! Hi!

53:00.161 --> 53:01.025
Hi!

53:01.096 --> 53:02.461
Nick-oop.

53:02.530 --> 53:03.462
Unh-

53:03.531 --> 53:04.463
Mmm.

53:06.201 --> 53:09.136
That's, uh,
that's a kiss from college.

53:09.204 --> 53:10.136
Boston University
thing. Ha!

53:10.205 --> 53:13.265
Uh, Nick,
this is Sam Mayfair.

53:13.341 --> 53:14.672
We work together
at Mercer.

53:14.743 --> 53:15.835
And, uh...

53:15.910 --> 53:18.310
This is, uh,
this is my Nick.

53:18.380 --> 53:19.312
Wow.

53:19.381 --> 53:20.678
Your Nick.

53:20.749 --> 53:22.614
And you're Nick.

53:22.684 --> 53:24.083
That's your Nick.

53:24.152 --> 53:26.086
I may have had
a little too much to drink.

53:26.154 --> 53:27.416
I'm her Sam.

53:29.424 --> 53:32.086
It certainly is an honor
to have met you, Nick.

53:32.160 --> 53:34.594
I mean, you know,
you've been the topic

53:34.663 --> 53:37.598
of a lot of conversation
and speculation around here.

53:37.666 --> 53:40.601
I'm very sorry that I monopolized
your fiancée's evening,

53:40.669 --> 53:43.604
but I've just come to realize
that she's...

53:43.672 --> 53:45.606
Damn it. She's just
the kind of girl

53:45.674 --> 53:47.505
you'd like to
monopolize, you know?

53:47.575 --> 53:48.872
Oh!

53:48.943 --> 53:50.308
Is everything
okay in there?

53:50.378 --> 53:53.108
Ha ha ha!

53:53.181 --> 53:56.173
What? Is that guy-
Is he your boyfriend?

53:56.251 --> 53:57.445
Oh, him? No.

53:57.519 --> 53:58.577
No. He's
just a friend.

53:58.653 --> 53:59.585
Oh.

53:59.654 --> 54:00.848
Sleeps over
sometimes,

54:00.922 --> 54:02.753
but he's
just a friend.

54:02.824 --> 54:04.525
Aha.

54:05.092 --> 54:07.925
Roger.

54:07.995 --> 54:09.428
Mike.

54:11.999 --> 54:14.433
Ivan.

54:14.501 --> 54:17.265
Sure is a lot of
boyfriends in here.

54:17.337 --> 54:19.532
Yeah. So?

54:19.606 --> 54:21.540
Going somewhere
with that?

54:21.608 --> 54:24.372
No. No, no, no.

54:24.444 --> 54:27.038
Not me.

54:27.114 --> 54:31.380
Just, uh, your life's
a real page-turner. That's all.

54:31.451 --> 54:34.215
Mmm.

54:34.288 --> 54:37.052
Oh! There's something
I forgot to ask you.

54:37.124 --> 54:39.251
How come there's nothing in the book
about your father?

54:43.630 --> 54:47.566
Well... nothing
really to talk about.

54:49.136 --> 54:53.573
I mean, he and my mother
split when I was 7,

54:53.640 --> 54:58.077
and I didn't see him again
for 10 years and then, uh...

54:58.145 --> 54:59.840
and then he passed away.

54:59.913 --> 55:01.574
I'm sorry.

55:01.648 --> 55:04.082
Don't be.
I mean...

55:04.151 --> 55:07.052
I really barely
remember the guy.

55:10.090 --> 55:14.527
He had a pair
of plaid pajamas.

55:16.597 --> 55:18.531
Ohh...

55:18.599 --> 55:24.538
Oh, and I remember, um,
one night after work...

55:26.106 --> 55:29.542
He took me to
the department store,

55:29.610 --> 55:32.545
just-just him and me,

55:32.613 --> 55:36.549
and, um, he bought me
my first watch.

55:36.617 --> 55:41.054
It was one of those Cinderella watches,
you know, um...

55:41.121 --> 55:42.611
Do you know what
I'm talking about?

55:42.689 --> 55:43.656
Mm-hmm.

55:43.724 --> 55:50.061
And, um, I remember
thinking to myself,

55:50.130 --> 55:53.122
this is really special.

55:54.635 --> 55:57.570
If I'd known
he was going to leave,

55:57.638 --> 56:00.072
I would have taken a little better
care of the thing, you know...

56:00.140 --> 56:02.631
hung on to it.

56:07.581 --> 56:13.076
Huh. It's weird,
the things you remember.

56:13.153 --> 56:14.586
Okay, my birthday?

56:14.655 --> 56:16.020
April 3, 1968.

56:16.089 --> 56:18.023
Okay, you can leave
out the year.

56:18.091 --> 56:19.023
First job?

56:19.092 --> 56:21.026
You were
a junior copywriter,

56:21.094 --> 56:24.530
but you were promoted
to full copywriter in 5 short months.

56:24.598 --> 56:26.031
Career ambition?

56:26.099 --> 56:28.033
Total world domination.
Do you want to get some breakfast?

56:28.101 --> 56:29.534
No. There's no time.

56:29.603 --> 56:31.036
Can I ask
you something?

56:31.104 --> 56:32.537
Yeah.

56:32.606 --> 56:34.540
Don't you, uh, don't you
need to learn about me?

56:34.608 --> 56:36.041
What do you mean?

56:36.109 --> 56:38.543
Well, you know, I'm really
boning up here about you.

56:38.612 --> 56:40.546
I mean, don't you think you should
learn a little about me?

56:40.614 --> 56:42.548
Yeah, but, Nick, you're forgetting.
This isn't about you.

56:42.616 --> 56:44.550
I mean,
not the real you.

56:44.618 --> 56:46.552
This is about
the you that I made up.

56:46.620 --> 56:49.555
Oh, you know what
I need to learn?

56:49.623 --> 56:50.555
What?

56:50.624 --> 56:52.057
How do you take
your coffee?

56:52.125 --> 56:53.592
Light, Sweet 'N Low.
Why?

56:53.660 --> 56:56.060
Well, you know, that's just stuff
I should know cold at dinnertime.

56:56.129 --> 56:58.063
When people are involved,
they know that stuff.

56:58.131 --> 57:00.065
Oh, right.
No, you're right.

57:00.133 --> 57:01.566
You got
a favorite drink?

57:01.635 --> 57:03.569
I mean, 'cause I don't want to
have to ask in front of everybody.

57:03.637 --> 57:05.002
Dirty Martini.

57:05.072 --> 57:07.006
Okay.

57:07.074 --> 57:08.473
Well, what about you?

57:08.542 --> 57:10.009
What about me?

57:10.077 --> 57:12.511
I mean, I think I should at least
know how you take your coffee.

57:12.579 --> 57:14.513
Well, I'm confused.
You don't know?

57:14.581 --> 57:16.515
I mean, didn't
you make me up?

57:16.583 --> 57:17.515
All right.

57:17.584 --> 57:19.017
Black, one sugar.

57:19.086 --> 57:20.018
Thank you.

57:20.087 --> 57:21.019
You're welcome.

57:21.088 --> 57:22.521
Okay, first dates
for 20.

57:22.589 --> 57:26.025
Monet exhibit, Museum of Modern Art,
September 1995.

57:26.093 --> 57:27.526
Pets for 40.

57:27.594 --> 57:29.528
She had this cat
named Jerry till she was 15.

57:29.596 --> 57:32.030
I didn't know her then, but I keep
threatening to get her a new cat.

57:32.099 --> 57:34.033
Mm-hmm. Final Jeopardy.
Personal imperfections.

57:34.101 --> 57:35.534
She has the cutest
little appendix scar,

57:35.602 --> 57:38.036
and of course there's
her birthmark that-

57:38.105 --> 57:40.039
Oh, honey, I wasn't supposed to
mention that. I'm sorry.

57:40.107 --> 57:41.540
All right.

57:41.608 --> 57:44.543
Then there's her glass eye
and her artificial hip

57:44.611 --> 57:46.340
and her wooden leg.

57:46.413 --> 57:47.345
Good evening.

57:47.414 --> 57:48.540
Hi.

57:48.615 --> 57:49.843
Want a seat?

57:49.916 --> 57:51.349
Sure. Go ahead.

57:55.122 --> 57:57.056
Mr. Mercer:
I mean, as I sit here,

57:57.124 --> 57:59.558
the thing I see when I
look at the two of you,

57:59.626 --> 58:04.325
the thing that moves me
is your unconditional love.

58:04.397 --> 58:05.489
Hear, hear.

58:05.565 --> 58:06.759
Thank you.

58:06.833 --> 58:09.996
That means so much to us,
especially coming from you.

58:10.070 --> 58:13.005
I mean, you're married,
and you really know.

58:13.073 --> 58:14.506
Yeah.

58:14.574 --> 58:17.008
Except for you, Darcy.
You've only been married 5 years.

58:17.077 --> 58:19.011
Well, that's
only dog-ears.

58:19.079 --> 58:22.014
But the Mercers and the Davenports
that really, um...

58:22.082 --> 58:25.017
Well, actually, Elizabeth and I
have been married,

58:25.085 --> 58:27.019
what, honey, 4 years?

58:27.087 --> 58:30.022
4 years. Second marriage
for both of us.

58:30.090 --> 58:32.024
I'm cuter than his ex-wife, though.
Ha ha!

58:32.092 --> 58:34.026
Second one
for me, too,

58:34.094 --> 58:37.530
but you only get married
for the second time once.

58:37.597 --> 58:39.531
Mrs. Mercer:
Jackie...

58:39.599 --> 58:40.531
Ohh...

58:40.600 --> 58:42.033
My third.

58:42.102 --> 58:46.038
Wow. Then you guys really know
what you're talking about.

58:46.106 --> 58:47.038
Yeah.

58:47.107 --> 58:49.041
Mrs. Mercer: We do.

58:49.109 --> 58:52.306
Ha ha ha.

58:55.115 --> 58:59.108
So, Nick, tell me
about videos.

58:59.186 --> 59:01.381
Well, uh, what
would you like to know?

59:01.454 --> 59:03.547
Well, um, how did you
get into that line of work?

59:03.623 --> 59:04.988
I mean, I watch
them all the time.

59:05.058 --> 59:07.492
A lot of smoke, a lot
of half-naked girls.

59:07.561 --> 59:09.085
Well, it seems like a decent way
to make a living.

59:09.162 --> 59:12.256
Huh. Really?

59:15.569 --> 59:19.232
Those aren't really
the kind of videos I do.

59:19.306 --> 59:23.003
Oh, I don't understand.
They all seem pretty much the same.

59:23.076 --> 59:24.771
What-What kind
do you do?

59:24.845 --> 59:29.475
I videotape weddings.

59:29.549 --> 59:35.010
Oh. Well, that-
That is different.

59:35.088 --> 59:37.386
Um, well, how did
you get into that?

59:42.596 --> 59:45.531
Uh, I was looking
for a job

59:45.599 --> 59:47.123
that would require me to work
as few days a week as possible,

59:47.200 --> 59:51.034
and your midweek wedding
is a pretty unusual occurrence.

59:51.104 --> 59:54.369
You can actually make
a living that way?

59:54.441 --> 59:57.035
Videotaping a wedding
or two on the weekends?

59:57.110 --> 59:58.600
I mean, that
satisfies you?

59:58.678 --> 01:00:00.612
No.

01:00:00.680 --> 01:00:04.081
But once I started
videotaping people's weddings,

01:00:04.150 --> 01:00:07.483
they would, you know,
come up to me for other things.

01:00:07.554 --> 01:00:10.580
You know, "My wife's having a baby
shower. Could you videotape that? '

01:00:10.657 --> 01:00:13.990
Or "Hey, my daughter's getting baptized.
Could you come on by? '

01:00:14.060 --> 01:00:16.620
Or "My kid's got the lead in the school
play. You gotto be there."

01:00:16.696 --> 01:00:22.999
I was working 6, 7 days
a week, and I loved it.

01:00:23.069 --> 01:00:25.060
I can't explain it
really.

01:00:25.138 --> 01:00:29.006
Something about watching a baby being
welcomed to the world by its new family

01:00:29.075 --> 01:00:33.011
or a kid getting his first at bat
in a little league game.

01:00:33.079 --> 01:00:34.410
I don't know.

01:00:34.481 --> 01:00:37.006
I don't know.
It's, uh...

01:00:37.083 --> 01:00:39.074
It's an honor.

01:00:39.152 --> 01:00:42.986
It's an honor that these people asked me
to be there for those moments...

01:00:43.056 --> 01:00:46.514
and I get paid for it.

01:00:51.831 --> 01:00:55.164
I'd like to propose
one last toast...

01:00:55.235 --> 01:00:57.169
to our new friend Nick...

01:00:57.237 --> 01:01:01.037
definitely someone
I'd like to have in my lifeboat.

01:01:01.107 --> 01:01:02.039
Hear, hear.

01:01:02.108 --> 01:01:03.040
Cheers.

01:01:03.109 --> 01:01:04.474
Thank you.

01:01:07.047 --> 01:01:09.038
What do you say,
honey?

01:01:09.115 --> 01:01:11.982
Don't be afraid
to dive right in.

01:01:28.068 --> 01:01:29.501
Whoo.

01:01:32.505 --> 01:01:33.995
Ahem.

01:01:34.074 --> 01:01:35.507
I suddenly realized

01:01:35.575 --> 01:01:37.509
that I haven't told you
how beautiful you look tonight.

01:01:37.577 --> 01:01:40.512
Oh, Nick, come on.
Don't waste that stuff.

01:01:40.580 --> 01:01:42.514
Nobody's here.
They can't hear you.

01:01:50.590 --> 01:01:53.525
Oh, I'm sorry.

01:01:53.593 --> 01:01:55.527
I'm sorry.

01:01:55.595 --> 01:01:57.529
Thank you.

01:02:00.100 --> 01:02:01.533
Thank you.

01:02:06.039 --> 01:02:07.973
Do you want to dance?
Maybe we should dance.

01:02:08.041 --> 01:02:09.474
Yeah, yeah.

01:02:29.062 --> 01:02:31.997
So how do you
think it's going?

01:02:32.065 --> 01:02:34.499
Um, fine, I guess.

01:02:34.567 --> 01:02:38.003
But you know if one of us
doesn't start this fight pretty soon,

01:02:38.071 --> 01:02:40.471
um, everybody's
going to miss it.

01:02:40.540 --> 01:02:42.007
Right.

01:02:43.576 --> 01:02:46.511
I was, uh...
I was thinking.

01:02:49.082 --> 01:02:52.449
What if, um, what if I didn't
pick a fight with you tonight?

01:02:52.519 --> 01:02:56.011
You know, what if we finished
our meal with these people and...

01:02:56.089 --> 01:02:57.386
And what?

01:02:57.457 --> 01:02:59.516
Um, I don't know.

01:02:59.592 --> 01:03:02.026
You know, I...

01:03:02.095 --> 01:03:03.960
You know,
I could come down on weekends.

01:03:04.030 --> 01:03:06.464
I could get to
know you better.

01:03:06.533 --> 01:03:07.465
Ahem.

01:03:07.534 --> 01:03:09.468
You could always
break up with me...

01:03:09.536 --> 01:03:11.470
down the road,
you know?

01:03:11.538 --> 01:03:12.869
Mm-hmm.

01:03:12.939 --> 01:03:15.373
Sorry if I'm making your life
more complicated, Kate, okay?

01:03:15.442 --> 01:03:17.876
But I find you
so attractive.

01:03:17.944 --> 01:03:19.969
Okay, stop! Don't!
Listen, don't say that.

01:03:20.046 --> 01:03:22.981
Come on. See,
that is why I wanted to pay you.

01:03:23.049 --> 01:03:25.483
Okay. No, you're right.
I'm sorry.

01:03:25.552 --> 01:03:27.486
I can't believe I'm apologizing
for liking you.

01:03:27.554 --> 01:03:30.182
Is it this other guy?
This guy that's not your boyfriend?

01:03:30.256 --> 01:03:31.484
Shh! Leave him out
of this, all right?

01:03:31.558 --> 01:03:33.253
We had a deal.
That's all.

01:03:33.326 --> 01:03:34.554
Then why isn't he
your boyfriend, Kate?

01:03:34.627 --> 01:03:35.525
If you like him so much
and he likes you,

01:03:35.595 --> 01:03:36.892
then why isn't he
your boyfriend?

01:03:36.963 --> 01:03:38.487
Because, technically,
I'm unavailable

01:03:38.565 --> 01:03:41.500
because, technically,
you are my boyfriend, okay?

01:03:41.568 --> 01:03:44.264
Oh. So let me get
this straight.

01:03:44.337 --> 01:03:48.569
You're sleeping with a guy who,
technically, you can't go out with,

01:03:48.641 --> 01:03:50.506
but you won't even
consider just dating me,

01:03:50.577 --> 01:03:52.738
who, technically, you're going to
marry and have kids with.

01:03:52.812 --> 01:03:56.509
Okay, look. Listen, I don't want to
date you. I don't want to marry you.

01:03:56.583 --> 01:04:00.019
I don't want to have kids with you.
I just want to break up with you.

01:04:00.086 --> 01:04:03.021
Please, that's
why we're here. Okay?

01:04:03.089 --> 01:04:06.923
So please can we
just stick to the plan?

01:04:06.993 --> 01:04:08.517
Please.

01:04:14.100 --> 01:04:15.931
See you
Wednesday, all right?

01:04:16.002 --> 01:04:17.526
Mrs. Davenport: Good night.

01:04:17.604 --> 01:04:20.539
Well, sorry, kids,
but we're out of here.

01:04:20.607 --> 01:04:23.542
No, no, no,
you can't leave yet.

01:04:23.610 --> 01:04:25.544
I know, I know, I sense
that something big is in the air,

01:04:25.612 --> 01:04:28.547
but I've gotto
get up early.

01:04:28.615 --> 01:04:29.547
We've got a meeting
with a marriage counselor.

01:04:29.616 --> 01:04:33.052
Nick, um, pleasure
meeting you,

01:04:33.119 --> 01:04:36.555
and you are everything
Kate said you would be.

01:04:36.623 --> 01:04:37.555
Good night.

01:04:37.624 --> 01:04:39.558
Good night!

01:04:39.626 --> 01:04:41.059
Mrs. Mercer: Good night.

01:04:41.127 --> 01:04:43.061
Good night.

01:04:43.129 --> 01:04:45.791
Mrs. Mercer: Oh, I love her.

01:04:45.865 --> 01:04:48.561
Jackie, she turned me on
to a great pilates teacher.

01:04:48.635 --> 01:04:50.262
Very ambitious.

01:04:50.336 --> 01:04:52.304
Honestly.

01:04:52.372 --> 01:04:55.569
This has been such
a wonderful evening.

01:04:55.642 --> 01:04:57.803
Thank you. Thanks.

01:04:57.877 --> 01:04:59.242
Yes, it has been.
It really has been.

01:05:00.647 --> 01:05:04.777
Mr. Davenport: Well, um,
one for the road?

01:05:09.322 --> 01:05:13.019
My! Honey!
Are you-excuse me.

01:05:13.092 --> 01:05:15.083
This is so weird, I-

01:05:15.161 --> 01:05:17.356
Come on!

01:05:19.098 --> 01:05:21.589
Everything all right
under there?

01:05:21.668 --> 01:05:23.533
Ooh! Yeah!

01:05:23.603 --> 01:05:26.834
I just, uh, kicked
myself in the shin.

01:05:26.906 --> 01:05:28.737
He's always-He's
always doing that.

01:05:28.808 --> 01:05:31.003
He just has this
weird tic thing that...

01:05:31.077 --> 01:05:32.169
Spasm.

01:05:32.245 --> 01:05:34.042
Oh, honey, you know
what? By the way,

01:05:34.113 --> 01:05:35.546
don't bother flying
in next weekend.

01:05:35.615 --> 01:05:37.549
I mean, I really need to spend
Saturday and Sunday

01:05:37.617 --> 01:05:39.380
figuring out
the new media buys

01:05:39.452 --> 01:05:40.714
for the next round
of Gulden's tests.

01:05:40.787 --> 01:05:41.811
Oh. Hey.

01:05:41.888 --> 01:05:44.755
If you got to work,
you got to work, right?

01:05:44.824 --> 01:05:47.657
I mean, how often does somebody
our age get the opportunity

01:05:47.727 --> 01:05:49.058
that Kate has?

01:05:49.128 --> 01:05:50.561
There's a team
player right there.

01:05:50.630 --> 01:05:52.461
You guys,
team-shmeam.

01:05:52.532 --> 01:05:54.557
Oh, you know what else,
though?

01:05:54.634 --> 01:05:56.761
About your parents'
35th anniversary party?

01:05:56.836 --> 01:05:58.064
Mmm?

01:05:58.137 --> 01:05:59.695
I don't think I can
commit to the date, honey.

01:05:59.772 --> 01:06:01.706
I'm sorry.
I just can't.

01:06:01.774 --> 01:06:04.072
I don't know where we're going to
be with Gulden's at that point.

01:06:04.143 --> 01:06:05.974
Don't worry about it.
I'm sure Mom and Dad will understand.

01:06:06.045 --> 01:06:08.013
You can see them
on their 36th anniversary.

01:06:13.586 --> 01:06:16.521
Darling, you know
what else on that other issue?

01:06:16.589 --> 01:06:21.026
I've decided no babies until I
put in a good 10 years at the agency.

01:06:21.094 --> 01:06:24.427
I mean, I think
I owe Mr. Mercer that.

01:06:24.497 --> 01:06:27.523
You know,
I had a hunch.

01:06:27.600 --> 01:06:29.033
So that's why
next weekend-

01:06:29.102 --> 01:06:30.535
when you're working,
of course-

01:06:30.603 --> 01:06:34.539
I'm going to look into
that surrogate mother thing

01:06:34.607 --> 01:06:36.768
we talked about, okay?

01:06:36.843 --> 01:06:41.576
I mean, a man's gotto do
what a man's gotto do, you know?

01:06:41.648 --> 01:06:44.549
Excuse me just for a second,
'cause I'll be right back.

01:06:44.617 --> 01:06:45.549
Excuse me.

01:06:45.618 --> 01:06:47.085
Hurry back, honey.

01:06:47.153 --> 01:06:48.814
Oh, don't worry.
I will.

01:06:48.888 --> 01:06:51.049
Okay.

01:06:51.157 --> 01:06:57.062
Excuse me, I was wondering-Could you
dial a phone number for me?

01:06:57.130 --> 01:06:59.792
Certainly,
Mademoiselle.

01:06:59.866 --> 01:07:05.566
But I mean, even then, you know,
with all that, I still just knew.

01:07:05.638 --> 01:07:06.935
My God, she was
20 pounds heavier.

01:07:07.006 --> 01:07:08.564
I mean, that's hard
to imagine.

01:07:08.641 --> 01:07:10.438
Yeah, it is, huh?
Hey, there she is.

01:07:10.510 --> 01:07:11.841
Here I am.

01:07:11.911 --> 01:07:13.105
Have a nice little chat
with yourself?

01:07:13.179 --> 01:07:14.237
Yes,
I certainly did.

01:07:15.315 --> 01:07:17.374
I think it's
in your purse.

01:07:17.450 --> 01:07:20.442
Ha! It's ours.

01:07:20.520 --> 01:07:21.953
Hello?

01:07:23.523 --> 01:07:27.960
Yes. Hold, please.

01:07:28.027 --> 01:07:30.222
It's for you.
It's her.

01:07:30.296 --> 01:07:32.059
Who her? What?

01:07:32.131 --> 01:07:34.065
Oh, come on, Nick.
This is humiliating enough.

01:07:34.133 --> 01:07:35.828
Would you just
take the phone?

01:07:37.537 --> 01:07:40.471
Hello?

01:07:40.540 --> 01:07:41.507
There's nobody there,
Kate.

01:07:41.574 --> 01:07:44.304
Well, no, not now
there isn't. No!

01:07:44.377 --> 01:07:45.901
Darling?

01:07:45.978 --> 01:07:48.606
I thought that was over.
I thought she was out of your life.

01:07:48.681 --> 01:07:50.444
I can't believe you.

01:07:50.516 --> 01:07:53.974
I can't believe this.
I'm sorry. This is- Oh, God!

01:07:54.053 --> 01:07:56.487
Well, maybe the rest of us
should go to the bar for a few moments.

01:07:56.556 --> 01:07:58.080
No, no, no!

01:07:58.157 --> 01:08:00.455
We-We-We can go
to the bar, please!

01:08:00.526 --> 01:08:03.518
We can go to the bar.

01:08:03.596 --> 01:08:06.121
Honey, why don't we go to the bar
where we can talk about this?

01:08:06.199 --> 01:08:08.429
No. You go to the bar, Nick!
You go to the bar,

01:08:08.501 --> 01:08:10.765
because that's where people go
when they want to meet people

01:08:10.837 --> 01:08:12.771
other than their wives
and their fiancées, isn't it?

01:08:12.839 --> 01:08:15.933
And besides, you know what?
We have nothing to talk about

01:08:16.008 --> 01:08:19.705
because we had an agreement
and you broke it!

01:08:19.779 --> 01:08:23.215
And I don't think
I like you very much anymore!

01:08:23.282 --> 01:08:26.115
Mrs. Mercer: You're doing
the right thing, honey.

01:08:26.185 --> 01:08:27.948
Put your foot down now.

01:08:28.020 --> 01:08:29.282
Thank you.

01:08:38.029 --> 01:08:39.861
So I have a mistress.

01:08:39.932 --> 01:08:42.526
You mean you admit it?

01:08:42.602 --> 01:08:44.466
Yes.

01:08:46.538 --> 01:08:47.971
I admit it.

01:08:48.040 --> 01:08:49.473
Okay.

01:08:49.542 --> 01:08:51.169
Yeah, I admit it.
I'm not ashamed of it, okay?

01:08:51.243 --> 01:08:53.576
And you know why
I have a mistress?

01:08:53.645 --> 01:08:55.671
Because she has
a mistress, too.

01:08:55.747 --> 01:08:57.648
She's gay?

01:08:57.716 --> 01:08:59.241
What are you saying?

01:08:59.318 --> 01:09:00.478
- You want to know what I'm saying?
- Yeah!

01:09:00.553 --> 01:09:01.986
I'll tell you what
I'm saying!

01:09:02.054 --> 01:09:04.783
I can no longer play sloppy seconds
to you and your job!

01:09:04.857 --> 01:09:07.758
You are so in love
with Mercer Advertising!

01:09:07.827 --> 01:09:10.091
It's all you do! It's all you
think about! It's all you talk about!

01:09:10.162 --> 01:09:12.426
Son, I want you to lower
your voice and sit down.

01:09:12.497 --> 01:09:13.863
Excuse me!

01:09:13.933 --> 01:09:16.925
Do either of you know what it's like
to always be number two

01:09:17.002 --> 01:09:18.937
in the eyes of
the woman you love?

01:09:23.509 --> 01:09:24.942
I do.

01:09:28.014 --> 01:09:29.810
Now I know
how Gulden's feels.

01:09:31.451 --> 01:09:33.942
Katie, I can no longer compete
with this man and his company,

01:09:34.020 --> 01:09:35.487
and I want out!

01:09:35.555 --> 01:09:37.716
What! What!
No, no, Nick!

01:09:37.790 --> 01:09:38.984
Nick, no. You
can't do this.

01:09:39.058 --> 01:09:41.457
Young man, this is not
the time and not the place.

01:09:41.527 --> 01:09:45.327
Excuse me!
I don't want to marry you, Kate!

01:09:45.398 --> 01:09:48.231
Do you understand?
I don't want to marry you!

01:09:48.301 --> 01:09:52.499
It's over! You hear me!
I don't want to marry you anymore.

01:09:52.572 --> 01:09:53.970
Not today!
Not tomorrow!

01:10:00.079 --> 01:10:02.013
Let me tell you
something.

01:10:02.081 --> 01:10:05.744
You may be a hero,
but you're no gentleman.

01:10:05.818 --> 01:10:06.910
Come on, Katie. Dinner's over.
Let's get out of here.

01:10:06.986 --> 01:10:08.920
Okay.

01:10:16.496 --> 01:10:19.863
You know, it's one thing to cheat
after a few years of marriage,

01:10:19.932 --> 01:10:21.991
but while you're
still single?!

01:10:23.803 --> 01:10:26.431
Shame on you!

01:10:30.510 --> 01:10:33.946
Don't bother looking back.
He is out of your life.

01:10:34.013 --> 01:10:35.378
Come on.

01:10:53.533 --> 01:10:55.467
Hey, how's your leg?

01:10:59.038 --> 01:11:00.471
Think I'll live.

01:11:00.540 --> 01:11:01.973
Yeah?

01:11:02.041 --> 01:11:05.169
Sorry. I got a little
carried away in there.

01:11:06.979 --> 01:11:09.914
So I guess now, um...

01:11:09.982 --> 01:11:11.540
Now your life's
perfect, huh?

01:11:11.617 --> 01:11:15.417
Well, uh...

01:11:15.488 --> 01:11:17.217
Yeah, actually.

01:11:20.493 --> 01:11:23.428
That's great.
Really, that's great.

01:11:30.603 --> 01:11:34.437
I never met anyone in my life that knew
what they wanted more than you do.

01:11:38.010 --> 01:11:39.443
Is that a compliment?

01:11:39.512 --> 01:11:42.447
Yes, it's a compliment.
Definitely a compliment.

01:11:42.515 --> 01:11:43.447
Thank you.

01:11:43.516 --> 01:11:45.541
You're welcome.

01:11:59.532 --> 01:12:01.466
That Sam's
a lucky guy.

01:12:04.971 --> 01:12:07.633
Make sure you tell
him I said so, okay?

01:12:34.500 --> 01:12:36.434
Aren't you supposed
to be with your boyfriend?

01:12:36.502 --> 01:12:38.936
How in God's name did
you get rid of him?

01:12:39.005 --> 01:12:40.939
Oh, it was awful,
so awful.

01:12:41.007 --> 01:12:43.441
We had this huge fight
in front of everybody.

01:12:43.509 --> 01:12:46.444
But it's okay.
It's over. We ended it.

01:12:50.516 --> 01:12:52.450
What?

01:12:52.518 --> 01:12:56.454
Well, I hope you
didn't do this for me.

01:12:56.522 --> 01:12:58.456
No.

01:12:58.524 --> 01:13:01.960
Egomaniac,
I did it for me.

01:13:05.965 --> 01:13:08.399
Now, why are you over there
and I'm over here?

01:13:08.467 --> 01:13:11.402
I just think you should take a breath
and think this through.

01:13:11.470 --> 01:13:14.405
I mean, what you had with Nick
was really special.

01:13:14.473 --> 01:13:18.409
Really?
You think so, huh?

01:13:20.479 --> 01:13:21.912
Hmm.

01:13:25.985 --> 01:13:27.418
You know what, Sam?

01:13:27.486 --> 01:13:29.420
You're just always going to be
that guy at the restaurant

01:13:29.488 --> 01:13:31.422
who, when he gets
what he ordered,

01:13:31.490 --> 01:13:34.425
always wishes he got
what the guy next to him did.

01:13:34.493 --> 01:13:36.927
Oh, wait, wait.
Come on, what are you doing?

01:13:36.996 --> 01:13:37.928
Please don't
leave mad.

01:13:37.997 --> 01:13:39.430
No, I should just leave.

01:13:39.498 --> 01:13:40.931
What are you
talking about?

01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:42.934
Come here, let me make you
a nice cup of coffee.

01:13:43.002 --> 01:13:44.936
You don't even know
how I take my coffee.

01:13:45.004 --> 01:13:47.438
Well, you'll tell me,
and then I'll know.

01:13:47.506 --> 01:13:49.440
No. Come on! No!
Will you just let me out of here?

01:13:49.508 --> 01:13:50.440
Hold on,
this one sticks.

01:13:52.011 --> 01:13:54.002
God, I'm so sorry.
Are you okay?

01:14:11.731 --> 01:14:13.460
That was fast.

01:14:13.532 --> 01:14:15.557
Sorry.

01:14:15.634 --> 01:14:18.262
Jesus!

01:14:19.538 --> 01:14:21.472
What happened, Kate?
Did he hit you?

01:14:21.540 --> 01:14:23.474
No. Just like everything else
that sucks in my life,

01:14:23.542 --> 01:14:24.474
I did it to myself.

01:14:24.543 --> 01:14:25.976
Come here.

01:14:26.045 --> 01:14:27.478
It's not a big deal.

01:14:27.546 --> 01:14:29.480
What do you mean it's not a big deal?
You look like a raccoon.

01:14:29.548 --> 01:14:30.981
I just need to get ice
on it, that's all.

01:14:31.050 --> 01:14:31.982
Okay, I'll get you ice.
I'll get you ice.

01:14:32.051 --> 01:14:33.484
Oh, I'm a big girl.

01:14:33.552 --> 01:14:34.484
Sit down. Sit down.

01:14:34.553 --> 01:14:35.986
Don't go anywhere.
Stay.

01:14:39.058 --> 01:14:40.150
You have any steak?

01:14:40.226 --> 01:14:41.591
No.

01:14:41.660 --> 01:14:44.322
Well, I don't think this Lean Cuisine's
going to get it done.

01:14:44.397 --> 01:14:45.489
Here.

01:14:45.564 --> 01:14:48.590
By the way, your mother
called about 5 times.

01:14:48.667 --> 01:14:50.999
I let the machine
get it.

01:14:51.070 --> 01:14:52.002
Thank you.

01:14:52.071 --> 01:14:53.003
They're peas.

01:14:53.072 --> 01:14:54.505
Go ahead.
They' refrozen.

01:14:54.573 --> 01:14:57.508
All right.
Ahh... no, no, no.

01:14:57.576 --> 01:14:59.043
Okay? Aww.

01:15:02.014 --> 01:15:03.675
Oh, God.

01:15:03.749 --> 01:15:04.613
It's on the floor
under my shirt.

01:15:06.519 --> 01:15:09.613
Hello? Hi, I'm fine.
I'm alive. Don't come over.

01:15:11.524 --> 01:15:15.984
My floral dress, my snakeskin sandals,
and my beaded bag.

01:15:19.031 --> 01:15:21.625
Yeah. Yeah. No.
They loved him, Mom.

01:15:21.700 --> 01:15:24.464
It was
a great night. We...

01:15:26.405 --> 01:15:28.464
I mean-but you know,
something happened actually. No.

01:15:28.541 --> 01:15:31.874
And, um... Ma,
I gotta call you back.

01:15:31.944 --> 01:15:34.606
Why did you do that?

01:15:35.881 --> 01:15:37.473
I don't know what to do.
I don't know what to do.

01:15:37.550 --> 01:15:38.812
Answer the phone.

01:15:38.884 --> 01:15:40.476
No, I don't want to lie.
I don't want to lie to her.

01:15:40.553 --> 01:15:41.645
Then don't.

01:15:53.065 --> 01:15:53.997
Hi, Ma.

01:15:54.066 --> 01:15:58.002
Yeah. No.
Uh, something happened.

01:15:58.070 --> 01:16:00.004
I don't know
what happened.

01:16:00.072 --> 01:16:03.508
No. I know, I know, Ma.

01:16:03.576 --> 01:16:06.443
I do know what happened.
I just-I panicked.

01:16:06.512 --> 01:16:09.913
Because I don't want you to be
disappointed in me.

01:16:12.751 --> 01:16:14.480
Right.

01:16:14.553 --> 01:16:17.954
I know that you think that I could never
disappoint you, but, Mom, let me tell you,

01:16:18.023 --> 01:16:18.955
I could.

01:16:20.526 --> 01:16:24.462
Oh, yeah, that's what you were
talking about, right?

01:16:24.530 --> 01:16:26.964
Well, you know,
they mostly loved him.

01:16:29.034 --> 01:16:31.468
Where is he?

01:16:31.537 --> 01:16:32.970
Now?

01:16:33.038 --> 01:16:34.198
Um...

01:16:35.708 --> 01:16:37.972
Well, see, now, what do you mean
when you say "where is he? '

01:16:38.043 --> 01:16:38.975
You mean, like,
physically now?

01:16:39.044 --> 01:16:40.944
I'm
right here, Rita.

01:16:41.013 --> 01:16:43.481
But, uh, you have to
promise not to be shocked

01:16:43.549 --> 01:16:46.211
or think any less of
your daughter, okay?

01:16:47.553 --> 01:16:49.646
Right now?

01:16:49.722 --> 01:16:55.524
Um... Well, a pair of boxer shorts,
a t-shirt, and a smile.

01:16:57.563 --> 01:16:58.530
Yeah?

01:17:00.566 --> 01:17:04.229
Well, you know what, I am looking
at your picture right now, too.

01:17:08.007 --> 01:17:09.440
Yeah.

01:17:09.508 --> 01:17:12.238
Yeah, I, uh,
I like her a lot.

01:17:13.512 --> 01:17:16.037
Well, in fact, uh...

01:17:16.115 --> 01:17:19.448
I like her more
every minute I spend with her.

01:17:22.521 --> 01:17:24.955
I'm gonna give you
back to Kate now, okay?

01:17:27.026 --> 01:17:29.961
Well, I look forward
to meeting you, too, Rita.

01:17:30.029 --> 01:17:31.291
Bye.

01:17:37.036 --> 01:17:39.470
Listen, Mom,
I'm gonna hang up now, okay?

01:17:42.041 --> 01:17:43.474
Oh, my God.

01:17:45.544 --> 01:17:48.479
A diaphragm, a sponge,
and a rubber. Good-bye.

01:18:21.513 --> 01:18:22.946
Thank you for that.

01:18:49.541 --> 01:18:53.807
Macy Gray: Games, changes, and fears

01:18:53.879 --> 01:18:58.248
When will they go from here?

01:18:58.317 --> 01:19:00.808
When will they stop

01:19:00.886 --> 01:19:04.054
I believe that lie,
and I choke

01:19:04.123 --> 01:19:07.923
I try to walk away,
and I stumble

01:19:07.993 --> 01:19:10.621
And though I try to
hide it, it's clear

01:19:10.696 --> 01:19:14.154
My world crumbles
when you are not there

01:19:14.233 --> 01:19:16.701
Good-bye, and I choke

01:19:16.769 --> 01:19:20.170
I try to walk away,
and I stumble

01:19:20.239 --> 01:19:22.173
And though I try to hide it

01:19:22.241 --> 01:19:23.435
It's clear

01:19:23.509 --> 01:19:26.137
My world crumbles
when you are not near

01:19:26.211 --> 01:19:27.439
You're kidding.

01:19:27.513 --> 01:19:29.413
His mistress showed up
right there at the dinner?

01:19:29.481 --> 01:19:30.948
Yeah. I heard Kate
had a complete breakdown.

01:19:31.016 --> 01:19:32.449
And then Mrs. Mercer
either punched him

01:19:32.518 --> 01:19:33.951
or punched
the girlfriend.

01:19:34.019 --> 01:19:35.486
I heard the guy
punched Mr. Mercer.

01:19:35.554 --> 01:19:37.454
I heard it turned into a giant brawl,
everybody punching everybody.

01:19:37.523 --> 01:19:38.751
Shh.

01:19:41.627 --> 01:19:44.689
Morning.

01:19:46.565 --> 01:19:47.497
See that?

01:19:48.600 --> 01:19:50.966
She looks like
Petey from Our Gang.

01:20:11.490 --> 01:20:12.514
Hello.

01:20:12.591 --> 01:20:13.922
You're still there.

01:20:13.992 --> 01:20:16.927
No. I-nothing's wrong.

01:20:16.995 --> 01:20:21.432
I just had this awful
feeling, uh,

01:20:21.500 --> 01:20:23.934
that, um...

01:20:24.002 --> 01:20:27.369
That you were gonna leave and I wasn't
gonna have a chance to say good-bye.

01:20:29.341 --> 01:20:30.672
You know how you said,

01:20:30.743 --> 01:20:32.938
um, last night about
coming down on the weekends-

01:20:33.011 --> 01:20:34.103
Ahem.

01:20:34.179 --> 01:20:38.445
Uh, you know what?
I gotto call you back.

01:20:38.517 --> 01:20:40.280
Are you gonna be around for a while?
Can I call you back?

01:20:40.352 --> 01:20:41.876
Don't go far.

01:20:46.024 --> 01:20:48.959
That must have been quite a show
you put on last night.

01:20:49.027 --> 01:20:50.961
It's all anybody's
talking about.

01:20:51.029 --> 01:20:52.963
I like
the Audrey Hepburn thing.

01:20:53.031 --> 01:20:54.464
Nice touch.

01:20:54.533 --> 01:20:56.899
Everyone will assume you're still
crying your eyes out.

01:20:56.969 --> 01:20:58.197
Yeah.

01:20:58.270 --> 01:20:59.965
Uh, Darce, I really gotto
talk to you about something.

01:21:00.038 --> 01:21:03.735
Well, Mr. Mercer and I, we have
something we'd like talk to you about.

01:21:03.809 --> 01:21:06.334
What? What did I do?

01:21:06.411 --> 01:21:09.471
Yeah, well, I'm pleased
you're pleased.

01:21:09.548 --> 01:21:11.072
I know.
Absolutely.

01:21:11.150 --> 01:21:12.174
Ahem.

01:21:12.251 --> 01:21:14.583
Uh, hold on.
My troops are just arriving.

01:21:14.653 --> 01:21:17.451
Yeah, I'll call you back.

01:21:19.158 --> 01:21:20.352
Ladies.

01:21:28.500 --> 01:21:32.436
Um, everybody okay?

01:21:32.504 --> 01:21:35.439
Oh, well,
she's just... you know.

01:21:35.507 --> 01:21:37.441
Good. Good.

01:21:37.509 --> 01:21:40.945
We've just gotten the results from
Gulden's advertising test in Rochester,

01:21:41.013 --> 01:21:44.949
and everyone is so pleased that they've
decided to launch nationally A. SA.P.

01:21:45.017 --> 01:21:46.382
Oh, God!

01:21:46.451 --> 01:21:48.942
Now, what this early go-ahead means
is that we've got a shot

01:21:49.021 --> 01:21:50.955
at putting something together
for the Super Bowl.

01:21:52.124 --> 01:21:54.957
Baby, the Super Bowl!
The Super Bowl, baby!

01:21:55.027 --> 01:21:56.187
Oh, my God!

01:21:56.261 --> 01:21:57.228
The Super Bowl.

01:21:57.296 --> 01:21:59.093
Oh, wow.
Oh, there's the chest pain.

01:21:59.164 --> 01:22:02.861
Davenport and his people are coming by
day after tomorrow to hear concepts.

01:22:02.935 --> 01:22:03.959
Yes. God.

01:22:04.036 --> 01:22:05.401
Can I have a tissue,
please?

01:22:05.470 --> 01:22:07.904
Also-And this is
a little complicated for me,

01:22:07.973 --> 01:22:10.407
but don't let it spoil
your good fortune-

01:22:10.475 --> 01:22:12.705
Davenport has asked me
to move Sela out of the way

01:22:12.778 --> 01:22:14.336
and to make you creative
leader on the account.

01:22:16.982 --> 01:22:18.916
Whoa.
What happened to you?

01:22:18.984 --> 01:22:20.110
Nothing.

01:22:20.185 --> 01:22:21.914
Oh, no. Nothing.

01:22:21.987 --> 01:22:23.420
Oh, it's not-This is not
what you think it is.

01:22:23.488 --> 01:22:24.819
It's-It's...

01:22:24.890 --> 01:22:26.915
I'm such a klutz. I was
getting dressed in the dark-

01:22:26.992 --> 01:22:29.426
Look, I know that this
goes without saying.

01:22:29.494 --> 01:22:32.429
Last night was very upsetting
for all of us.

01:22:32.497 --> 01:22:34.431
I mean, no one more so
than you, I'm sure,

01:22:34.499 --> 01:22:36.433
but everyone here is
working under the assumption

01:22:36.501 --> 01:22:38.401
that this part of
your life is over,

01:22:38.470 --> 01:22:41.928
that this person
is out of your life.

01:22:42.007 --> 01:22:43.941
I mean, with
this big account,

01:22:44.009 --> 01:22:47.945
we're all gonna be eating a lot
of dinners, going to a lot of functions,

01:22:48.013 --> 01:22:50.447
maybe picking up
a clio or two,

01:22:50.515 --> 01:22:54.451
and he is not someone
anyone wants to see again...

01:22:54.519 --> 01:22:56.453
certainly not with you.

01:23:25.484 --> 01:23:28.681
There's something
wrong with your phone.

01:23:28.754 --> 01:23:31.917
No, uh, I waited by it
all day for you to call me back,

01:23:31.990 --> 01:23:34.424
and when you didn't,
I figured it out.

01:23:34.493 --> 01:23:36.927
There must be something
wrong with it...

01:23:36.995 --> 01:23:38.724
Something wrong
with something.

01:23:38.797 --> 01:23:41.925
Oh, Nick, I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.

01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:43.934
I... I'm a terrible person.

01:23:44.002 --> 01:23:46.937
It just sort of got
really crazy here today.

01:23:47.005 --> 01:23:49.940
Well, um...
Good crazy?

01:23:50.008 --> 01:23:52.442
Well, good crazy,
bad crazy.

01:23:52.511 --> 01:24:00.441
Um... I kind of got this enormous
opportunity to, um, do a commercial.

01:24:00.519 --> 01:24:01.952
That sounds good.

01:24:02.020 --> 01:24:05.456
It is good.
It is good, very good.

01:24:05.524 --> 01:24:06.991
Uh...

01:24:09.027 --> 01:24:11.825
I mean, you know, as you
can see in front of you,

01:24:11.897 --> 01:24:13.455
it's, um...

01:24:13.532 --> 01:24:16.467
I'm gonna be working
like mad, you know,

01:24:16.535 --> 01:24:18.469
and it means
a lot of late nights

01:24:18.537 --> 01:24:25.966
and, uh, deadlines and,
uh, migraines, and, um...

01:24:26.044 --> 01:24:32.381
Doesn't really leave a lot
of time for anything else.

01:24:32.451 --> 01:24:35.284
Is that the official
change of subject that just went by?

01:24:38.056 --> 01:24:40.991
It's just really bad timing
with this, Nick.

01:24:41.059 --> 01:24:42.788
Really bad timing.

01:24:58.577 --> 01:25:00.044
I want you to have that.

01:25:07.019 --> 01:25:10.955
I haven't been around
nearly as much as you, Kate, but, um...

01:25:11.023 --> 01:25:14.390
I'm pretty sure you're supposed to
leave that on the night table.

01:25:14.459 --> 01:25:16.450
All right. You know,
don't say that, okay?

01:25:16.528 --> 01:25:18.962
That's for your travel expenses
and your-your incidentals.

01:25:19.031 --> 01:25:20.430
I know what it's for.

01:25:20.499 --> 01:25:22.967
Well, what do you
want me to do, huh, Nick?

01:25:23.035 --> 01:25:24.969
I mean, you want me
to just quit?

01:25:25.037 --> 01:25:27.733
All of this just because you had one nice
conversation with my mother on the phone?

01:25:27.806 --> 01:25:29.239
Okay. I'll see you
around, Kate.

01:25:29.307 --> 01:25:31.468
Or what? Just lie? Tell them
it was a lie? It was all a big joke?

01:25:31.543 --> 01:25:32.771
I mean...

01:25:32.844 --> 01:25:33.902
That's a thought.

01:25:33.979 --> 01:25:35.469
Oh, yeah.

01:25:35.547 --> 01:25:36.980
Okay.

01:25:39.151 --> 01:25:40.243
Thank you.

01:25:41.553 --> 01:25:43.612
I'll leave your key
under your mat.

01:25:46.058 --> 01:25:47.821
I mean, you know, Nick,
remember the plan?

01:25:47.893 --> 01:25:49.793
You were just
supposed to go away.

01:25:49.861 --> 01:25:50.987
Right?

01:26:01.072 --> 01:26:04.940
Aimee Mann: I'm told the case
is now closed

01:26:08.546 --> 01:26:11.947
So I can come to my senses

01:26:12.016 --> 01:26:13.074
Hi, Mom.

01:26:16.254 --> 01:26:19.417
But when the question
is posed

01:26:22.827 --> 01:26:26.593
I'll have
this meager defense

01:26:26.664 --> 01:26:33.797
I was hopin' that
you'd know better than this

01:26:33.871 --> 01:26:40.868
I was hopin',
but you're an amateur

01:26:40.945 --> 01:26:46.815
I was hopin' that
you'd know better

01:26:46.884 --> 01:26:53.653
But I've been wrong before

01:26:53.724 --> 01:26:55.487
Tracy's gonna kill me,
I'm so late.

01:26:55.559 --> 01:26:57.493
Second Share
a cab downtown?

01:26:57.561 --> 01:26:59.495
My boyfriend's
meeting me at PJ. Clarke's.

01:26:59.563 --> 01:27:00.996
Can I bring Sarah?

01:27:01.065 --> 01:27:02.930
Yeah, I suppose.

01:27:11.509 --> 01:27:12.840
Carlos.

01:27:16.013 --> 01:27:17.446
Hey, Kate.

01:27:17.515 --> 01:27:18.447
Yeah?

01:27:18.516 --> 01:27:19.778
It's gonna be great.

01:27:19.850 --> 01:27:21.317
Thank you.

01:27:23.020 --> 01:27:23.952
Hi.

01:27:24.021 --> 01:27:24.953
Oh. Thanks.

01:27:26.023 --> 01:27:26.955
Same thing.

01:27:27.024 --> 01:27:28.457
That's two dollars,
please?

01:27:30.027 --> 01:27:31.289
Hmm.

01:27:32.530 --> 01:27:33.963
Okay.

01:27:34.031 --> 01:27:34.963
Sorry.

01:28:20.010 --> 01:28:21.534
I'm sorry, I can't-

01:28:21.612 --> 01:28:24.945
I don't think I'm going to be able
to present this idea this afternoon.

01:28:29.019 --> 01:28:30.953
Really?

01:28:31.021 --> 01:28:32.454
Why not?

01:28:34.525 --> 01:28:35.719
It's Nick.

01:28:40.030 --> 01:28:44.091
Wait a minute. Nick, your, uh,
fiancé, the fellow who cheated on you?

01:28:45.536 --> 01:28:47.470
Right.

01:28:47.538 --> 01:28:53.704
Right, except, uh, he was never my
fiancé, and, uh, he never cheated on me.

01:28:55.546 --> 01:28:59.983
Well, um,
I'm totally confused.

01:29:00.050 --> 01:29:01.984
I know.

01:29:02.052 --> 01:29:07.422
He was just this guy that I happened to
have a photograph taken with at a wedding.

01:29:07.491 --> 01:29:09.925
I mean, I didn't even
know him.

01:29:09.994 --> 01:29:13.930
He was just a stranger,
and when he got famous,

01:29:13.998 --> 01:29:19.834
I went and I found him and offered him
money to come and have dinner with us.

01:29:23.007 --> 01:29:30.937
I asked him to make a fool
out of himself, and he didn't want to,

01:29:31.015 --> 01:29:34.451
uh, but he did it for me.

01:29:34.518 --> 01:29:39.455
He did it to please me,
and I did it to please you,

01:29:39.523 --> 01:29:40.990
and I'm sorry.

01:29:41.058 --> 01:29:48.464
And I'm sorry most of all,
I think, that I convinced myself

01:29:48.532 --> 01:29:56.337
that whatever talent I had meant nothing unless
it came in this package that everyone liked.

01:30:00.044 --> 01:30:03.980
I guess you could say I was
dressing for the job I wanted.

01:30:07.985 --> 01:30:09.714
I'll be out of my office
in 20 minutes.

01:30:24.001 --> 01:30:24.933
Hey, hey.

01:30:25.002 --> 01:30:26.936
Yeah?

01:30:27.004 --> 01:30:29.438
There never was a Nick?

01:30:29.507 --> 01:30:30.439
No.

01:30:30.508 --> 01:30:33.443
You-You just
made him up?

01:30:33.511 --> 01:30:35.445
Yeah.

01:30:35.513 --> 01:30:40.450
And one of the reasons
was... to be with me?

01:30:40.518 --> 01:30:42.952
Mm-hmm.

01:30:43.020 --> 01:30:44.044
Wow.

01:30:46.023 --> 01:30:46.955
Wow.

01:30:49.026 --> 01:30:51.620
You-You really are
a bad girl.

01:30:53.030 --> 01:30:54.520
I mean...

01:30:56.534 --> 01:30:58.968
You really
are something.

01:30:59.036 --> 01:31:01.470
Yep. I know.

01:31:01.539 --> 01:31:03.404
I am something.

01:31:05.476 --> 01:31:07.910
Oh, but you know, Sam...

01:31:07.978 --> 01:31:09.809
I'm a good girl.

01:31:11.482 --> 01:31:13.416
I think that's always
been our problem,

01:31:13.484 --> 01:31:16.920
is, you know, I-
I'm just a good girl.

01:31:16.987 --> 01:31:18.181
You sure?

01:31:18.255 --> 01:31:20.416
Mm-hmm.

01:31:25.996 --> 01:31:33.129
I tell you, though, if I ever change,
you're the first person I'm calling.

01:31:39.510 --> 01:31:40.602
I hope so.

01:31:53.023 --> 01:31:53.955
Okay.

01:31:59.530 --> 01:32:01.896
Just, um...
couple of things.

01:32:04.969 --> 01:32:09.906
You know, when I-when I applied
for my first job at Young & Rubicam,

01:32:09.974 --> 01:32:12.875
I told them that I graduated
in the top 10% of my class.

01:32:14.478 --> 01:32:17.072
Well, the truth is I was
lucky to graduate at all.

01:32:20.484 --> 01:32:25.922
Oh. Why don't you take a few days off,
maybe- maybe go upstate,

01:32:25.990 --> 01:32:27.924
maybe go to Massachusetts?

01:32:48.512 --> 01:32:51.072
Hear that music? That means
the main event's about to start,

01:32:51.148 --> 01:32:53.742
so you better get in your seat
so you don't miss it. Go ahead.

01:32:53.817 --> 01:32:55.944
There she goes,
back to her seat.

01:32:56.020 --> 01:32:57.453
Heh heh heh!

01:33:08.465 --> 01:33:09.989
Thanks for the watch.

01:33:16.473 --> 01:33:18.634
Ok, Nick, I'm sorry.

01:33:21.645 --> 01:33:23.408
I'm working now,
you know.

01:33:23.480 --> 01:33:26.415
I know. I just wanted
to tell you that, um,

01:33:26.483 --> 01:33:28.041
I told everybody
the truth.

01:33:28.118 --> 01:33:30.416
Well, that's...

01:33:30.487 --> 01:33:32.045
that's great.

01:33:32.122 --> 01:33:33.054
Yeah.

01:33:33.123 --> 01:33:35.421
That's great.

01:33:35.492 --> 01:33:36.857
Good-bye, Kate.

01:34:08.025 --> 01:34:10.289
Would you all
please be seated?

01:34:20.037 --> 01:34:21.231
Nick.

01:34:23.540 --> 01:34:25.007
I-

01:34:25.075 --> 01:34:29.478
Dearly beloved, we are
gathered here in the sight of God

01:34:29.546 --> 01:34:32.481
and in the face of
this congregation

01:34:32.549 --> 01:34:37.486
to join together this man
and this woman in holy matrimony,

01:34:37.554 --> 01:34:39.613
and therefore, if any man
can show just cause...

01:34:39.690 --> 01:34:42.989
Kate... I got to work.

01:34:43.060 --> 01:34:45.893
Just... Kate, just go.

01:34:45.963 --> 01:34:46.895
No.

01:34:46.964 --> 01:34:47.896
Yes.

01:34:47.965 --> 01:34:49.762
- Yes.
- No.

01:34:49.833 --> 01:34:51.926
- No!
...forever hold his peace.

01:34:58.075 --> 01:35:02.944
Daniel, do you have something
you'd like to tell me?

01:35:05.015 --> 01:35:08.451
I've never seen that woman
before in my life...

01:35:08.519 --> 01:35:10.180
Uh, I don't think.

01:35:11.522 --> 01:35:14.150
Uh, Miss.
You back there.

01:35:14.224 --> 01:35:15.452
He's talking to you.

01:35:15.526 --> 01:35:17.960
Do you have something to say,
something to tell us?

01:35:18.028 --> 01:35:18.960
No. No.

01:35:19.029 --> 01:35:20.462
I'm sorry.

01:35:20.531 --> 01:35:22.192
No. Holding
my peace.

01:35:22.266 --> 01:35:25.099
Got away from me
for a moment, but holding it.

01:35:27.538 --> 01:35:29.597
It's held.
I promise.

01:35:32.543 --> 01:35:33.840
God.

01:35:37.414 --> 01:35:39.473
Oh, my God.

01:35:42.052 --> 01:35:45.988
Hi. Could you do me a favor
and hold this for me?

01:35:46.056 --> 01:35:48.490
Just point it-Seethe bride
and the groom over there?

01:35:48.559 --> 01:35:49.992
You know them, right?

01:35:50.060 --> 01:35:53.154
Can I, uh... Miss?
Could we, uh...

01:35:54.665 --> 01:35:56.462
Get over here.

01:35:56.533 --> 01:35:57.522
Listen, Kate-

01:35:57.601 --> 01:36:00.092
I know.
I was calculating and callous.

01:36:00.170 --> 01:36:03.606
And manipulative
and condescending and...

01:36:03.674 --> 01:36:04.936
Okay.

01:36:09.012 --> 01:36:10.570
I miss you.

01:36:18.021 --> 01:36:21.957
Look, I know
I don't deserve it,

01:36:22.025 --> 01:36:25.893
but I would love
another chance.

01:36:29.733 --> 01:36:35.467
You know, I'm not asking for,
like, a ring or anything, you know?

01:36:35.539 --> 01:36:37.632
I just want a date.

01:36:39.042 --> 01:36:40.669
You know, just a date.

01:36:43.547 --> 01:36:45.538
I mean, hey, you know,
I know how you take your coffee.

01:36:58.562 --> 01:36:59.790
Okay.

01:37:01.565 --> 01:37:02.725
Okay.

01:37:28.525 --> 01:37:30.049
You bunny hop?

01:37:33.530 --> 01:37:34.462
Huh?

01:37:34.531 --> 01:37:37.022
Well, after this
there's a reception,

01:37:37.100 --> 01:37:42.436
and maybe after that we could
see a movie or... something.

01:37:56.553 --> 01:37:59.488
Ladies and gentlemen!

01:37:59.556 --> 01:38:01.148
Thank you.

01:38:01.224 --> 01:38:03.988
Unless someone has something else to
say, I now pronounce you man and wife.

01:38:04.061 --> 01:38:05.528
You may kiss the bride.

01:39:12.996 --> 01:39:18.263
20 seconds
on the bad time

01:39:18.335 --> 01:39:21.133
I'm a-feel you're on the run

01:39:23.240 --> 01:39:26.505
Never lived too long
to make right

01:39:28.412 --> 01:39:32.246
I see you're doin' fine

01:39:32.315 --> 01:39:37.184
And when I get that feeling,
I can no longer slide

01:39:37.254 --> 01:39:39.154
I can no longer run

01:39:39.222 --> 01:39:41.053
Oh, no, no

01:39:41.124 --> 01:39:44.525
And when I get that feeling

01:39:44.594 --> 01:39:47.188
I can no longer hide

01:39:47.264 --> 01:39:51.598
For it's no longer fun,
oh, no, no

01:39:51.668 --> 01:39:54.432
Yeah, you can say
what you want

01:39:54.504 --> 01:39:56.597
But it won't change my mind

01:39:56.673 --> 01:39:58.937
I'll feel the same

01:39:59.009 --> 01:40:01.477
About you

01:40:01.545 --> 01:40:04.537
And you can tell me
your reasons

01:40:04.614 --> 01:40:06.912
But it won't
change my feelings

01:40:06.983 --> 01:40:09.417
I'll feel the same

01:40:09.486 --> 01:40:11.249
About you

01:40:13.156 --> 01:40:18.492
What I am is
what you want of me

01:40:18.562 --> 01:40:22.931
Yeah, now that I'm not there

01:40:22.999 --> 01:40:28.437
I took the tables
away from you

01:40:28.505 --> 01:40:32.305
It's turning, I don't care

01:40:32.375 --> 01:40:34.935
And when I get that feeling

01:40:35.011 --> 01:40:37.479
I can no longer slide

01:40:37.547 --> 01:40:41.108
I can no longer run,
oh, no, no

01:40:41.184 --> 01:40:44.483
And when I get that feeling

01:40:44.554 --> 01:40:46.954
I can no longer hide

01:40:47.023 --> 01:40:50.959
For it's no longer fun,
oh, no, no

01:40:51.027 --> 01:40:54.485
Yeah, you can say
what you want

01:40:54.564 --> 01:40:56.759
But it won't change my mind

01:40:56.833 --> 01:41:01.668
I'll feel
the same about you

01:41:01.738 --> 01:41:04.730
And you can tell me
your reasons

01:41:04.808 --> 01:41:06.799
But it won't
change my feelings

01:41:06.877 --> 01:41:11.678
I'll feel the same about you

01:41:11.748 --> 01:41:14.740
Yeah, you can say
what you want

01:41:14.818 --> 01:41:16.877
But it won't
change my mind

01:41:16.953 --> 01:41:21.413
I'll feel the same about you

01:41:21.491 --> 01:41:24.483
And you can tell me
your reasons

01:41:24.561 --> 01:41:26.893
But it won't
change my feelings

01:41:26.963 --> 01:41:31.730
I'll feel the same about you

01:41:31.801 --> 01:41:34.929
And when I get that feeling

01:41:35.005 --> 01:41:37.030
I can no longer smile...
