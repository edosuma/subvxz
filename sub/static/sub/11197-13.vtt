00:10.960 --> 00:12.960
(alarm)

00:18.440 --> 00:22.080
Receiving SG-1's lDC, sir.
Request permission to open the iris.

00:22.200 --> 00:24.160
Do it.

00:26.000 --> 00:32.073
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:41.160 --> 00:43.280
Welcome home, SG-1 . How did it go?

00:43.400 --> 00:47.040
General, you know
how l love those sandy planets.

00:47.160 --> 00:49.840
The wind was most pleasant.

00:49.920 --> 00:53.520
Jaffa sarcasm at its finest, General.

00:53.600 --> 00:55.760
There wasn't much left to study.

00:55.840 --> 00:58.640
Most of it has been
eaten away by sandstorms.

00:58.720 --> 01:02.560
But we did find evidence suggesting
it was some sort of science outpost

01:02.640 --> 01:04.800
or observatory built by the Ancients.

01:04.920 --> 01:07.840
That's the artefact you mentioned?
What is it?

01:07.960 --> 01:13.120
- We're not sure.
- l'd say it's some kind of bug zapper.

01:13.200 --> 01:15.480
All l know is it's emitting energy.

01:15.600 --> 01:19.440
lt was hidden underground,
just below the main section of the ruins.

01:19.520 --> 01:21.960
l tried picking it up
and it started glowing.

01:22.080 --> 01:24.240
Touching it must've activated it.

01:24.360 --> 01:29.120
- You're certain it isn't dangerous?
- As certain as l can be.

01:29.200 --> 01:33.760
My initial scans indicate
that the energy it's emitting is harmless.

01:33.840 --> 01:37.040
That makes it worthy of study
as a potential power source.

01:37.120 --> 01:38.320
Colonel

01:38.400 --> 01:40.080
- What?
- There.

01:41.040 --> 01:44.960
- You don't see that?
- No. What?

01:47.040 --> 01:50.080
lt just disappeared into the wall.

01:53.240 --> 01:56.560
- What did?
- l don't know. Something.

01:56.680 --> 02:01.040
lt was an alien creature of some kind.
You didn't see it?

02:01.160 --> 02:05.440
lt was right there.
lt was right there, General.

02:08.800 --> 02:12.640
This is Hammond. l want a class-one
security lockdown of the base now.

02:12.760 --> 02:16.960
This is not a drill.
Repeat, this is not a drill.

03:25.120 --> 03:26.560
As you were.

03:26.680 --> 03:30.480
ln the past six hours, security teams
have swept the base three times.

03:30.600 --> 03:34.480
They found no trace whatsoever
of the creature you described.

03:34.560 --> 03:37.280
You're certain
it disappeared into the wall?

03:37.360 --> 03:41.600
Yeah. lsn't it possible something
followed us back through the gate?

03:41.680 --> 03:44.400
Something that can
penetrate solid matter?

03:44.480 --> 03:48.640
- ls that unheard of?
- Nothing showed up on the video.

03:48.760 --> 03:52.400
Mr Quinn, you understand
l'm not questioning your judgment,

03:52.520 --> 03:56.720
but without further evidence l must return
the base to normal operating status.

03:56.840 --> 03:59.200
Yes, sir, l understand.

03:59.280 --> 04:03.200
SG-1's had a particularly
busy mission schedule lately.

04:03.280 --> 04:07.840
You're all due for some downtime.
l suggest you take it starting right now.

04:07.960 --> 04:10.240
Dismissed.

04:14.440 --> 04:21.360
You only saw a flash of this creature.
Are you sure it wasn't a hallucination?

04:21.480 --> 04:24.800
- You're suggesting l'm delusional?
- No, no.

04:24.880 --> 04:30.720
lt's just possible you were seeing
something that wasn't entirely...

04:32.240 --> 04:34.000
Yes, that's what we're suggesting.

04:34.120 --> 04:40.200
You think l'm having symptoms related
to my prior exposure to naquadria.

04:42.280 --> 04:47.200
- Dr Fraiser gave me a clean bill of health.
- Over three months ago.

04:47.320 --> 04:53.560
- Jonas, we're just concerned about you.
- There was something alive down there.

04:58.720 --> 05:01.000
lt was real.

05:02.840 --> 05:05.280
l could stay.

05:05.360 --> 05:07.520
We've all been cleared. The base is clean.

05:07.600 --> 05:11.360
Jonas is probably suffering from stress.
This is all still new to him.

05:11.480 --> 05:14.640
- You could come with.
- Sir?

05:14.760 --> 05:16.800
Fishing. l'm going fishing.

05:16.920 --> 05:21.040
- l'm planning on studying the artefact.
- Yes.

05:21.160 --> 05:24.320
- lt's always something, isn't it?
- Come on, sir.

05:24.440 --> 05:28.560
The only reason you asked is because
you knew l had something else to do.

05:28.640 --> 05:33.600
No, really, l think you should come.
Fish, fish some more...

05:48.400 --> 05:50.960
This is what you do with your downtime?

05:51.040 --> 05:56.240
Colonel O'Neill asked me to go fishing
with him, but l find this more relaxing.

05:56.360 --> 05:57.280
How are you doing?

05:57.400 --> 06:02.880
The possibility of being insane has been
interfering with my ability to relax.

06:03.000 --> 06:05.920
l figured l'd take a crack at these glyphs.

06:06.040 --> 06:09.920
Fine with me. But l still have
no idea what we're dealing with.

06:10.000 --> 06:14.080
l've scanned it with x-rays,
ultraviolet, mild EM pulses.

06:14.200 --> 06:17.680
Nothing has had any effect
on the particles it's emitting.

06:17.760 --> 06:20.240
- Particles?
- For lack of a better word.

06:20.360 --> 06:22.240
They're energy patterns.

06:22.320 --> 06:26.880
So far l haven't been able to identify them
or determine their purpose.

06:26.960 --> 06:30.960
l was hoping that the writings
on the device itself would tell us more.

06:31.080 --> 06:33.040
Let's see what it says.

06:34.240 --> 06:37.920
The symbols are definitely a form
of language used by the Ancients.

06:38.040 --> 06:42.160
Although the Ancients have been around
so long, the language has evolved.

06:42.240 --> 06:44.680
But we do have a base reference...

06:44.800 --> 06:46.720
Hah

06:46.840 --> 06:48.800
What?

06:50.640 --> 06:54.640
You're telling me that you don't see that?

06:54.720 --> 06:56.720
What?

06:58.440 --> 07:01.120
lt's right there in front of you.

07:09.240 --> 07:13.280
OK, there's definitely
something wrong with me.

07:18.240 --> 07:22.000
No evidence of brain damage
from exposure to naquadria radiation.

07:22.120 --> 07:26.720
No indication of any viruses
or toxins in your system.

07:26.840 --> 07:31.520
CAT scan, MRls, blood work all came
back clean. He's in perfect health.

07:31.640 --> 07:32.880
Physically.

07:33.000 --> 07:36.240
That's all l can say definitively.

07:36.360 --> 07:40.320
You show no signs of stress
that usually accompany hallucinations.

07:40.440 --> 07:43.000
Then why am l the only one
seeing these things?

07:43.080 --> 07:44.640
l wish l had an answer.

07:44.720 --> 07:50.720
Until we find out exactly what's going on,
l must remove you from active duty.

07:50.800 --> 07:58.480
General Hammond, sir, these visions only
started when we returned with the device.

07:58.560 --> 08:02.320
- What are you suggesting?
- l know l can't go on any missions,

08:02.400 --> 08:08.400
but at least let me continue
researching the device with Major Carter.

08:08.480 --> 08:10.560
There has to be a connection.

08:10.680 --> 08:13.600
Major Carter has already
submitted her report.

08:13.680 --> 08:16.960
Nothing suggests the device
is connected to your condition.

08:17.040 --> 08:21.120
Until someone presents hard evidence,
we have to assume it's a coincidence.

08:21.240 --> 08:23.520
l haven't translated the writing.

08:23.600 --> 08:29.040
You'll have to do it from video reference.
The device is being shipped to Area 51 .

08:37.080 --> 08:39.919
l can't believe they're shipping it out.

08:40.000 --> 08:43.080
We barely got a crack
at figuring out what it is.

08:43.200 --> 08:47.480
Perhaps the scientists in Nevada
will determine the device's true purpose.

08:47.560 --> 08:51.040
Meanwhile,
l'm stuck here cooling my heels.

08:51.120 --> 08:53.560
You are welcome
to join me as l kelno'reem.

08:53.680 --> 08:58.960
No offence, Teal'c, but it doesn't
quite have the same effect on me.

08:59.080 --> 09:00.640
No other plans?

09:00.720 --> 09:04.400
Colonel O'Neill requested
that l accompany him fishing.

09:04.480 --> 09:08.960
- l'm the only one he didn't invite.
- You are not permitted to leave the base.

09:09.080 --> 09:10.640
Still...

09:10.760 --> 09:14.080
Be extremely happy that he did not ask.

09:14.200 --> 09:17.280
Why, you don't like fishing?

09:17.400 --> 09:18.320
No.

09:18.400 --> 09:22.400
Seeing as how l've read every book
in the base library twice,

09:22.480 --> 09:25.480
l guess l'll get back to work on my...

09:37.440 --> 09:39.800
- You saw that?
- lndeed.

10:18.160 --> 10:22.200
Hey, there.
You just caught me fixing a carburettor.

10:22.320 --> 10:24.800
- l didn't hear you pull in.
- No problem.

10:24.920 --> 10:29.640
You sure? lt's a full-service station.
The price includes yours truly.

10:29.760 --> 10:32.800
- l got it, thanks.
- All right.

10:32.880 --> 10:36.200
At least l can wash your windows for you.

10:39.120 --> 10:42.480
What do you get, five miles
to the gallon in this thing?

10:42.600 --> 10:44.560
Yeah, it's a pig.

10:45.560 --> 10:49.120
l'm more of an El Camino fan, myself.

10:49.240 --> 10:52.720
The things are like catnip to the ladies.

10:52.840 --> 10:54.800
Don't l know it?

11:09.000 --> 11:10.960
- What?
- Get down.

11:15.000 --> 11:17.040
The money's inside in a lockbox

11:17.160 --> 11:21.920
- l'm not gonna rob you. Just get down.
- Getting down.

11:29.880 --> 11:34.720
- Don't kill me, please. l'm a vet.
- l'm not gonna kill you. Get up.

11:34.800 --> 11:38.640
Colonel Jack O'Neill, US Air Force.
Did you see anything?

11:38.720 --> 11:44.080
Just my life flashing before my eyes.
What the hell were you shooting at?

11:44.160 --> 11:47.360
- lt's classified.
- You can tell me.

11:47.440 --> 11:51.040
l work here. lf there's something
going on, l should know about it.

11:51.120 --> 11:54.640
- O'Neill for Hammond.
- l served in the Gulf.

11:54.760 --> 11:57.760
- What division?
- Motor pool.

11:59.960 --> 12:01.920
Oh, man, my sign.

12:05.640 --> 12:09.360
Patching through a call
from Colonel O'Neill, sir.

12:09.480 --> 12:11.680
Colonel, where are you?

12:11.760 --> 12:13.840
About 30 clicks north, sir.

12:13.920 --> 12:18.000
l just saw something...
fairly interesting.

12:18.080 --> 12:21.280
- They've breached base containment.
- Sir?

12:21.360 --> 12:25.520
We're seeing them here, too.
They're everywhere.

12:33.680 --> 12:36.240
Anything?

12:36.360 --> 12:42.320
lt says something about an experiment,
but l'm hung up on a few of these glyphs.

12:42.440 --> 12:47.360
They were studying beings
of the something something.

12:47.480 --> 12:52.080
According to this, it should be ''inner
layer'', the beings of the inner layer.

12:52.160 --> 12:55.600
- But that doesn't make much sense.
- Not really.

12:57.520 --> 13:00.160
Maybe ''other level''?

13:00.280 --> 13:04.240
- What about ''another dimension''?
- That could work.

13:04.360 --> 13:07.760
lt'd make sense if they're inhabiting
a dimension close to ours.

13:07.880 --> 13:11.280
Yeah, absolutely. Yeah. Thanks.

13:12.520 --> 13:14.320
ls that it?

13:14.400 --> 13:16.640
Sorry, l'm working as fast as l can.

13:16.720 --> 13:22.000
l know. General Hammond wants
a full report as soon as possible.

13:26.880 --> 13:30.000
Look, l'm the one who's sorry.

13:30.120 --> 13:33.280
We should never have doubted you
about what you saw.

13:33.400 --> 13:37.520
lt's understandable,
with the whole naquadria-poisoning thing.

13:37.600 --> 13:39.360
Besides, l am still the new guy.

13:39.440 --> 13:44.640
You're part of the team now and you
deserve our respect. You've earned it.

13:44.760 --> 13:47.200
Jonas, you're doing a great job.

13:48.640 --> 13:50.000
Thanks.

13:51.400 --> 13:55.600
- Now, figure out what else this thing says.
- Right.

14:01.800 --> 14:06.320
Colonel O'Neill will stay in Colorado
Springs and coordinate the quarantine.

14:06.400 --> 14:08.480
The National Guard is standing by.

14:08.560 --> 14:13.680
The president is prepared
to declare a state of emergency.

14:13.800 --> 14:18.160
Hopefully, these things,
whatever they are, haven't gotten too far.

14:18.240 --> 14:20.320
We're not sure we can contain them.

14:20.440 --> 14:24.400
- You halted the transfer of the device?
- Yes, and we've learned more.

14:24.520 --> 14:29.600
l think l've translated enough
of the writings to figure out its purpose.

14:29.680 --> 14:32.400
lt's broadcasting energy particles.

14:32.520 --> 14:38.320
We're not sure, but we think they're
triggering an ability to see the creatures.

14:38.400 --> 14:42.880
Hopefully, only those exposed to the
particles will develop this second sight.

14:42.960 --> 14:46.080
None of the ciphers we have fit perfectly,

14:46.200 --> 14:51.600
but, as l understand it, the device
is meant to allow us to observe beings

14:51.680 --> 14:53.840
that exist in a parallel dimension.

14:53.920 --> 14:58.080
We think the energy particles
create a bleed-through effect,

14:58.160 --> 15:02.400
causing anyone exposed to them
to see into this parallel dimension.

15:02.520 --> 15:05.040
We can't contain them
because they aren't here?

15:05.120 --> 15:10.800
They do exist, just not in any way
that allows us to interact with them.

15:10.880 --> 15:13.440
They didn't follow us through the gate.

15:13.520 --> 15:17.360
- Where did they come from?
- The ones we're seeing are from Earth.

15:17.480 --> 15:22.720
These creatures could exist anywhere.
We've just been unaware of them.

15:22.800 --> 15:26.320
- What is your threat assessment?
- l can't say for sure,

15:26.400 --> 15:28.560
but with regards to the creatures, none.

15:28.680 --> 15:32.160
lf they only exist in their dimension,
they can't harm us.

15:32.240 --> 15:36.400
There's no physiological interaction
beyond our ability to see them.

15:36.520 --> 15:40.640
While we might be able to deal
with seeing interdimensional beings...

15:40.720 --> 15:44.400
lf the effect spreads to the general public,
we could have a disaster.

15:44.520 --> 15:47.360
They're not used to seeing
unusual things like we are.

15:47.480 --> 15:50.320
And we can't control when
or where a sighting occurs.

15:50.440 --> 15:54.880
lmagine a surgeon doing delicate surgery
and he's distracted.

15:55.000 --> 15:59.120
- Or an air-traffic controller.
- Even something like driving a car.

15:59.200 --> 16:03.520
People might be able to deal with it, but
not before it turns the world upside down.

16:03.640 --> 16:08.960
Not to mention the exposure of the
Stargate programme in trying to explain it.

16:09.080 --> 16:12.160
Shut off that device.

16:12.240 --> 16:15.440
- We've tried, sir.
- Find a way.

16:21.960 --> 16:26.160
Colonel O'Neill says
there haven't been any further sightings.

16:26.280 --> 16:30.560
We've triangulated the sightings
to a 500-metre radius around the device.

16:30.640 --> 16:34.320
lt attracts the creatures to it,
most likely part of its design.

16:34.400 --> 16:38.640
The closer we get to the machine,
the more frequently we'll see our friends.

16:38.720 --> 16:42.400
We've been unable to find
any types of controls or switches.

16:42.480 --> 16:46.240
The last resort is separating
the main crystal core from the unit.

16:46.320 --> 16:49.200
Hopefully,
that will stop it from functioning.

16:49.320 --> 16:55.120
- What are you waiting for?
- This is an advanced piece of technology.

16:55.240 --> 17:01.760
- l have no idea what effect it will have.
- lf this effect continues to spread...

17:01.840 --> 17:04.640
Attempting to remove crystal core.

17:15.000 --> 17:20.119
My scans are no longer detecting
any particle emissions from the device.

17:20.200 --> 17:22.800
Anyone see anything?

17:41.640 --> 17:43.560
Major Carter.

17:43.680 --> 17:46.000
- Any sightings?
- Not me.

17:46.120 --> 17:50.920
- My kelno'reem was undisturbed.
- We may have solved the problem.

17:51.040 --> 17:53.040
Teal'c thinks we should take it back.

17:53.120 --> 17:57.440
Take it back? We've barely scratched
the surface of what it can do.

17:57.560 --> 18:00.400
Now it's shut off, it's safe to study.

18:00.480 --> 18:02.240
To what end?

18:02.320 --> 18:05.320
The effect that device had
was groundbreaking.

18:05.400 --> 18:08.320
- Once we figure out how to use it...
- Eventually.

18:08.400 --> 18:13.080
- These creatures are worth studying.
- The Ancients certainly thought so.

18:13.160 --> 18:15.800
They're aware of matter in our dimension

18:15.920 --> 18:18.480
or they wouldn't rest on objects
we see as solid.

18:18.560 --> 18:20.960
Plus they can pass through solid matter.

18:21.080 --> 18:25.440
Also, the ones we've encountered seem
to demonstrate a higher intelligence,

18:25.560 --> 18:29.800
- but that doesn't mean we can't...
- (woman screams)

18:38.160 --> 18:38.960
Sergeant?

18:39.080 --> 18:41.320
Mission time
is 24 minutes, three seconds.

18:41.400 --> 18:44.800
MALP AV link to P9X-391
is up and running.

18:44.880 --> 18:48.480
SG-1 , this is Hammond.
What's your status?

18:50.120 --> 18:54.480
We're in the ruins, about to enter the
antechamber where we found the device.

18:54.600 --> 18:57.920
- Anything coming through the wormhole?
- Negative.

18:58.000 --> 19:01.040
No unidentified energy patterns
are being detected.

19:01.120 --> 19:03.280
Does that mean we're free and clear?

19:03.360 --> 19:05.200
Even if we can shut the device down,

19:05.320 --> 19:10.440
it's possible there was residual particle
radiation my instruments couldn't detect.

19:10.520 --> 19:13.760
- This should take care of that.
- lt's back where we found it.

19:13.840 --> 19:18.640
There's nothing else here that would
explain what happened with the device.

19:18.760 --> 19:23.120
Once the gate is shut down, it should cut
off any energy patterns being broadcast.

19:23.200 --> 19:26.640
Affirmative.
We'll re-establish contact in one hour.

19:26.720 --> 19:27.760
Hammond out.

19:27.880 --> 19:29.840
- Shut it down.
- Yes, sir.

19:29.960 --> 19:33.760
- Deactivating wormhole.
- l'll be in my office.

19:34.920 --> 19:36.880
Uh, sir...

19:44.880 --> 19:48.560
Are you certain bringing the device
back here was the right decision?

19:48.640 --> 19:50.800
lt's the only way we can solve this, sir.

19:50.880 --> 19:53.800
Returning the device
to P9X-391 should have worked.

19:53.920 --> 19:58.160
lt couldn't project an effect from off-world
without the Stargate being active.

19:58.240 --> 20:01.280
Why do we still possess
the ability to see these creatures?

20:01.360 --> 20:04.000
The effect the particles
have on us must be persistent.

20:04.120 --> 20:05.760
Hopefully, it's not permanent.

20:05.840 --> 20:10.080
New sightings have been reported on
base by personnel not previously affected.

20:10.160 --> 20:12.640
The situation is getting worse.

20:12.760 --> 20:15.440
lt doesn't make sense. Without exposure...

20:15.520 --> 20:18.400
- What if it's not the particles?
- How can that be?

20:18.480 --> 20:21.440
One function of the device
was to attract the creatures.

20:21.560 --> 20:26.400
When we shut that down, or thought
we shut it down, they seemed to go away.

20:26.480 --> 20:30.880
l get it. What if the particles
were only what was attracting them?

20:30.960 --> 20:33.120
Sure, like food.

20:33.240 --> 20:38.440
Now, shutting down that part of the device
just made the creatures leave the area.

20:38.520 --> 20:43.760
Whatever's giving us the ability to see
them is something completely different.

20:43.880 --> 20:45.760
Something unrelated to the device?

20:45.880 --> 20:50.640
No, sir, that seems unlikely,
but it could be something we've missed.

20:50.760 --> 20:55.080
OK, l was the first one
to see the creatures, right?

20:57.160 --> 21:02.560
l was also the first one
to touch the device. Teal'c was next.

21:02.680 --> 21:06.680
Touching the device could have
altered our bodies' electrical field

21:06.800 --> 21:09.080
enough to cause the bleed-through effect.

21:09.200 --> 21:13.680
But that doesn't explain the people who
had no direct contact with the device.

21:13.760 --> 21:16.800
Unless the charge can be passed on
from person to person.

21:16.920 --> 21:18.880
Like a contagion.

21:21.080 --> 21:24.640
l'll order the containment of Colorado
Springs and surrounding area.

21:24.760 --> 21:30.240
We'll also need to isolate anyone who
had physical contact with SGC personnel.

21:54.600 --> 21:56.560
Son of a...

22:44.120 --> 22:46.880
Thank you. Yes. Keep me apprised.

22:48.440 --> 22:50.320
We're getting reports of sightings.

22:50.440 --> 22:54.480
No one's been hurt, but a local
news station has picked up the story.

22:54.600 --> 22:58.720
Colonel O'Neill is rounding up anyone
he may have come in contact with.

22:58.840 --> 23:02.560
- The quarantine is otherwise in place.
- What's our cover story?

23:02.680 --> 23:06.640
A spill of an experimental chemical
that can have an hallucinogenic effect.

23:06.760 --> 23:09.040
So far, people are buying it.

23:09.120 --> 23:11.120
But that won't work for long.

23:11.240 --> 23:15.000
This may be our only chance
to contain this problem. lf we can't...

23:15.120 --> 23:16.960
Mass hysteria.

23:17.840 --> 23:21.120
This is our mistake, Major.
We need to fix it.

23:21.240 --> 23:22.240
Yes, sir.

23:28.000 --> 23:29.680
Careful.

23:33.960 --> 23:36.720
- lnteresting.
- What?

23:38.360 --> 23:42.560
Do you think the configuration affects
the nature of the charge the device emits?

23:42.640 --> 23:46.320
We reorder the crystals,
we change what the device does.

23:46.440 --> 23:48.960
Why else
would they be arranged this way?

23:49.040 --> 23:52.400
There are a number of configurations
to choose from.

23:52.480 --> 23:56.880
How do we know which one
will elicit the right effect?

23:59.080 --> 24:00.960
This could take a while.

24:17.440 --> 24:19.360
There's no one here, sir.

24:19.480 --> 24:23.360
Leave someone here
in case he comes back.

24:37.040 --> 24:37.920
Vernon?

25:01.960 --> 25:04.240
There was a huge bug on my car.

25:04.360 --> 25:06.960
No, l swear. Did anyone see that?

25:08.280 --> 25:10.240
Huge bug

25:21.480 --> 25:23.440
Vernon?

25:26.960 --> 25:30.080
You're certain you've reprogrammed
the device properly?

25:30.200 --> 25:36.720
To be honest, sir, we're not sure, but this
is one of the last few configurations to try.

25:53.320 --> 25:59.280
We're hoping it's now programmed to
emit a charge that reverses the effect.

25:59.400 --> 26:01.960
OK, here goes.

26:05.760 --> 26:08.120
Feel anything?

26:08.240 --> 26:09.440
Not really.

26:09.560 --> 26:11.920
Do you see anything?

26:14.200 --> 26:16.000
No.

26:16.120 --> 26:18.080
Do you?

26:18.680 --> 26:19.800
No.

26:23.920 --> 26:26.000
When you want to see one...

26:28.760 --> 26:29.680
There.

26:30.640 --> 26:31.680
Where?

26:31.760 --> 26:34.160
Right there on the device.

26:35.280 --> 26:39.920
lf there's a creature right there,
then l'm not seeing it.

26:42.080 --> 26:44.080
Jonas.

26:52.120 --> 26:56.480
l think it worked, sir.
l'm not seeing it any more.

27:04.880 --> 27:06.880
Well done, Major.

27:37.360 --> 27:40.080
The antidote seems to be working.

27:40.200 --> 27:44.480
No new sightings and everyone
affected is no longer seeing creatures.

27:44.560 --> 27:48.160
We need to spread the cure to
Colonel O'Neill and the containment team

27:48.240 --> 27:50.680
so they can spread it
through the exposed area.

27:50.800 --> 27:53.600
l recommend a placebo pill
to sell it to the public,

27:53.680 --> 27:57.360
and, provided the containment holds,
we should be able to undo the damage.

27:57.440 --> 28:00.400
- (phone rings)
- Hammond.

28:00.480 --> 28:04.800
Sir, an individual l came in contact with
has breached the quarantine.

28:04.880 --> 28:07.760
- Anything we can do?
- Get Carter and Jonas on this.

28:07.840 --> 28:12.880
The man is Vernon Sharpe, a non-com,
served in the motor pool in the Gulf.

28:13.000 --> 28:17.840
- See what they come up with.
- Right away.

28:17.920 --> 28:20.800
We have an exposed man on the run.

28:40.560 --> 28:43.440
- How far you headed?
- As far as you can take me.

28:43.560 --> 28:46.240
l'm picking up a cousin
in Hawthorne County.

28:46.360 --> 28:48.400
- That's fine.
- Hop in.

28:49.560 --> 28:52.560
(radio) The latest update
on the situation in Colorado.

28:52.680 --> 28:57.600
The National Guard continues to maintain
its quarantine of Colorado Springs

28:57.680 --> 29:02.680
after a chemical spill may have had
an adverse effect on some residents.

29:02.800 --> 29:06.000
You hear about that?
People say they're seeing monsters.

29:06.120 --> 29:07.920
Yeah, l know. Crazy.

29:15.000 --> 29:19.360
Vernon Sharpe drained all the money
from his accounts several hours ago.

29:19.480 --> 29:21.920
You can get this information this easily?

29:22.000 --> 29:25.120
We only use the privilege
in certain circumstances.

29:25.200 --> 29:26.720
He could be anywhere by now.

29:26.840 --> 29:32.400
We've frozen his credit cards, but since
he's using cash, he'll be harder to trace.

29:32.520 --> 29:36.120
So he's just gonna vanish?
That makes no sense.

29:36.240 --> 29:38.320
- What do you mean?
- He's ex-military.

29:38.440 --> 29:42.800
lt can't simply be fear of these creatures.
What's he running for?

29:42.920 --> 29:45.520
He doesn't buy the cover story.

29:46.680 --> 29:49.680
The only way we'll find him
is by learning more about him.

29:49.760 --> 29:54.400
Can we find out if he has
any friends or family in the area?

29:59.640 --> 30:02.240
What's he gone and done now?

30:02.320 --> 30:06.960
He hasn't done anything, Mrs Sharpe.
We're just very worried about Vernon.

30:07.080 --> 30:09.360
Cookie?

30:09.440 --> 30:10.560
Thank you.

30:10.680 --> 30:15.600
l know how you feel. l've been worrying
about Vernon since he was a boy.

30:15.680 --> 30:20.240
l was the one who raised him
after his mother ran off, you know.

30:20.360 --> 30:25.360
- l'm sure you did a fine job.
- She was a real floozy, that one.

30:25.480 --> 30:28.640
My Roger never had
much taste in women.

30:28.720 --> 30:32.560
Mrs Sharpe,
we're afraid that your grandson

30:32.640 --> 30:36.480
may suspect that the government
is after him for the wrong reasons.

30:36.560 --> 30:39.120
Why are you after him?

30:40.800 --> 30:43.200
Vernon may have been
exposed to a chemical

30:43.320 --> 30:48.160
that could be causing him
to see things that aren't really there.

30:48.280 --> 30:51.520
Like when he was in the war.

30:51.640 --> 30:52.640
What do you mean?

30:52.760 --> 30:58.160
The military did all kinds of things
to those boys while they were over there.

30:58.240 --> 31:03.840
Experiments with chemical weapons
and such. Messed with their heads good.

31:03.920 --> 31:06.560
My Vernon's never been the same.

31:06.640 --> 31:09.600
We don't really know anything about that.

31:09.720 --> 31:12.240
l'm sure you don't, honey.

31:13.080 --> 31:17.360
lt's very, very important
that we find your grandson.

31:17.480 --> 31:21.080
He could be putting
other people's lives in danger, ma'am.

31:21.200 --> 31:26.000
- Vernon wouldn't hurt a fly.
- Unintentionally, of course.

31:26.080 --> 31:31.200
The truth is, Vernon's exposure
to this chemical wasn't an accident.

31:31.320 --> 31:33.280
lt wasn't even a chemical.

31:33.360 --> 31:37.280
lt was a contagious experimental germ
developed by the military.

31:37.400 --> 31:38.480
Really?

31:38.600 --> 31:44.160
lt was created to try and undo what
happened to your grandson in the Gulf.

31:44.240 --> 31:46.960
Oh, l find that hard to believe.

31:47.080 --> 31:49.680
l swear. l wouldn't lie to you.

31:49.800 --> 31:54.320
Unfortunately, there were some
unexpected side effects to this antidote.

31:54.440 --> 31:56.960
Those doctors will be the death of us all.

31:57.040 --> 32:02.320
See all those pills l'm supposed to take?
l never take any of 'em.

32:03.120 --> 32:07.680
We want to make this right, and it's not
just your grandson's life that's at stake.

32:07.800 --> 32:10.240
There could be other people in danger.

32:10.360 --> 32:14.040
l promise nothing bad
will happen to Vernon.

32:15.600 --> 32:18.960
Well, you seem like a nice enough couple.

32:19.560 --> 32:23.760
- Oh, we're not...
- Please, we really wanna help.

32:30.040 --> 32:37.280
Well, Lord knows Vernon needs help.
He's not right in the head, that boy.

32:37.360 --> 32:41.120
- We'll do our best.
- Do you know where he might be?

32:41.200 --> 32:45.200
lf he's off anywhere,
it's to see that Chuck fellow.

32:45.280 --> 32:47.440
Chuck?

32:47.560 --> 32:50.720
He's trouble.
Always has been, always will.

32:50.840 --> 32:56.800
l told Vernon straight away,
''That Chuck will lead you to no good.''

32:56.880 --> 33:00.160
Does Chuck have a last name?

33:00.240 --> 33:02.720
l'm sure he does.

33:04.600 --> 33:06.560
l just don't know it.

33:10.000 --> 33:12.560
Do you know where he lives?

33:26.560 --> 33:29.760
- Thanks for the lift.
- Good luck, Vernon.

33:46.360 --> 33:49.600
Hi. l need a one-way ticket to Las Vegas.

33:58.960 --> 34:01.400
Just what we need, a conspiracy theorist.

34:01.520 --> 34:05.360
One who happens to be right
about there being a conspiracy.

34:05.440 --> 34:08.560
There has been another sighting
in Hawthorne County.

34:08.679 --> 34:09.920
Any word on Vernon?

34:10.040 --> 34:15.040
The affected person says he picked up
a hitchhiker matching his description.

34:15.159 --> 34:16.960
Thanks.

34:20.840 --> 34:23.520
- O'Neill.
- lt's me, sir.

34:23.600 --> 34:27.880
We believe Vernon may be at Piedmont
Hawthorne airfield on his way to Vegas.

34:27.960 --> 34:31.520
Have Hammond ground all flights.
Containment team is en route.

34:31.639 --> 34:35.320
- ETA's about 40 minutes.
- Have you been cleared?

34:35.440 --> 34:38.360
Somebody from the SGC
shook our hands.

34:38.440 --> 34:41.199
Sir, Vernon could be extremely paranoid.

34:41.320 --> 34:44.560
Given his military background,
use caution in apprehending him.

34:44.639 --> 34:47.440
l'll keep that in mind.

34:47.520 --> 34:50.960
- Good job, Carter.
- Thank you, sir.

35:42.200 --> 35:44.400
They cancelled my flight.

35:44.520 --> 35:46.960
What did they think of the script?

35:47.080 --> 35:48.400
What?

35:48.520 --> 35:51.440
The second-act twist is totally clear.

35:51.520 --> 35:54.000
Oh...

35:54.120 --> 35:56.120
(screaming)

36:03.120 --> 36:07.280
l'm sorry, but we've just been told
the flight has been cancelled.

36:07.360 --> 36:12.880
Please return to the terminal where
more information will be provided.

36:31.360 --> 36:33.360
Vernon.

36:34.200 --> 36:36.080
There he is. Let's move.

36:47.640 --> 36:51.400
You guys cover the exits.
l'll take it from here.

37:04.800 --> 37:06.800
Vernon?

37:09.080 --> 37:11.040
You can't get away.

37:27.640 --> 37:31.320
Hey, Vernon. lt's Jack O'Neill.

37:33.560 --> 37:35.920
Colonel O'Neill?

37:36.040 --> 37:38.000
The Air Force?

37:47.560 --> 37:52.960
Look, l know
this is a massive cliché, but...

37:54.680 --> 37:56.720
the place is surrounded.

37:56.840 --> 38:01.840
Yeah, you're telling me.
Those monsters are everywhere.

38:05.040 --> 38:08.320
All right, l know you're seeing things.

38:09.480 --> 38:12.240
lt's gotta be a little confusing.

38:15.120 --> 38:19.840
- You're gonna kill me for what l know.
- Nobody's gonna kill you.

38:22.080 --> 38:27.000
lt's the Gulf all over again,
only this time it's innocent civilians too.

38:27.120 --> 38:29.840
You're doing scientific research on us.

38:29.920 --> 38:33.280
You won't get away with it.
The truth will get out.

38:35.640 --> 38:37.520
You know, you're right.

38:37.600 --> 38:39.640
Our cover story is bogus.

38:39.760 --> 38:41.440
lt is?

38:41.560 --> 38:43.640
Yep.

38:43.720 --> 38:47.880
But the truth isn't what you think.

38:48.000 --> 38:52.360
Those creatures you're seeing,
they're aliens.

38:53.080 --> 38:54.280
Come on.

38:54.400 --> 38:58.120
Hey, you wanted the truth, that's it.

38:58.720 --> 39:02.880
l work for a top-secret branch of the
military that deals with extraterrestrials.

39:03.000 --> 39:06.560
- That's what you were seeing.
- You're serious?

39:07.160 --> 39:09.880
Yes, very serious.

39:12.560 --> 39:14.560
But the thing is...

39:15.600 --> 39:21.120
those things, they're no threat to us.

39:21.200 --> 39:24.240
lf you couldn't see them,
you wouldn't know they were there.

39:24.360 --> 39:26.360
No, but l am seeing them.

39:26.480 --> 39:29.840
ln fact, l'm seeing one right now.

39:29.920 --> 39:32.280
Well, we can make it so you don't.

39:32.400 --> 39:34.360
Then what?

39:36.000 --> 39:40.400
Look, Vernon, this can't get out, not yet.

39:41.160 --> 39:44.000
The world is not ready to know.

39:44.120 --> 39:46.960
So you just want me to keep it quiet?

39:47.080 --> 39:50.560
Well, think about it.
Who's gonna believe you?

39:50.680 --> 39:55.200
Government experiments are one thing,
but we're talking aliens here.

39:55.280 --> 39:58.880
- Yeah, but other people have seen them.
- Not for long.

39:59.000 --> 40:02.760
Besides,
they're all buying our cover story.

40:06.560 --> 40:09.200
Vernon, your country needs you.

40:11.800 --> 40:16.720
l'm asking you, one soldier to another,
play ball on this.

40:18.960 --> 40:20.360
OK.

40:20.480 --> 40:24.560
l'm not taking any pills
or needles or anything.

40:24.640 --> 40:26.640
You won't have to.

40:29.920 --> 40:31.880
We're all clear.

40:36.720 --> 40:39.640
- We good?
- Yes, sir.

40:48.440 --> 40:51.120
- What planet are they from?
- Who?

40:51.240 --> 40:52.960
The aliens.

40:53.080 --> 40:56.360
Oh. A place called Melmac.

40:58.080 --> 41:00.240
lsn't that where Alf is from?

41:00.360 --> 41:03.840
- Who?
- Alf, you know, on TV, the puppet.

41:04.880 --> 41:06.800
Never saw it.

41:06.880 --> 41:08.880
No kidding?
