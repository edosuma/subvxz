[theme music playing]

01:22.984 --> 01:24.569
[music playing]

01:25.486 --> 01:26.905
[Jidenna rapping]

02:14.202 --> 02:15.829
[grunts]

02:57.746 --> 02:58.830
[man grunts]

03:06.755 --> 03:07.922
[groans]

03:09.173 --> 03:10.675
[man groaning] Bitch!

04:07.148 --> 04:08.942
This ain't no social.

04:12.654 --> 04:15.031
This is what we call
a State of the Union.

04:17.951 --> 04:20.244
Darrell, how we doing after Fort Knox?

04:22.956 --> 04:25.208
Break it down and let it be broke.

04:26.125 --> 04:27.836
[Darrell] Ain't nothing to let be.

04:28.461 --> 04:30.379
You are broke.

04:32.924 --> 04:34.968
Let me rephrase.

04:35.051 --> 04:37.011
You got your real estate.

04:37.095 --> 04:39.097
Mama Mabel left you the club.

04:39.180 --> 04:42.433
You and Mariah share the deed
on her old brownstone.

04:42.516 --> 04:44.769
I know you got some cash, right?

04:47.480 --> 04:51.192
I got at least... 250 laying around.

04:52.526 --> 04:54.403
[Darrell] Well, Fort Knox
is what hurts, baby.

04:54.487 --> 04:58.324
You lost seven figures,
seven times over.

04:58.407 --> 05:01.494
All of your cash profits from the corners,
stash houses, drops.

05:01.577 --> 05:03.621
You still got stocks,
the club profits, but...

05:05.164 --> 05:06.540
But what?

05:06.624 --> 05:08.960
The streets is talkin'.

05:09.043 --> 05:12.171
And that dude with the hoodie,
if he's still out there...

05:12.255 --> 05:14.465
This nigga too scared to say his name.

05:15.925 --> 05:18.970
Koko, this ain't PS 154.
You ain't gotta raise your hand, man.

05:19.053 --> 05:20.388
[Koko] I been reading this book.

05:20.471 --> 05:23.182
[chuckles] Huh. You readin' now?

05:23.266 --> 05:25.518
- [laughing]
- Yeah. It's a... it's a book on politics

05:25.601 --> 05:28.938
and the social conditions
that created hip-hop.

05:29.022 --> 05:31.440
The Dodgers left Brooklyn,

05:31.524 --> 05:33.692
Robert Moses created
the Cross Bronx Expressway,

05:33.777 --> 05:36.863
and white folks went
running for the suburbs.

05:36.946 --> 05:41.075
This cat named Moynihan went and hollered
at Nixon, and told the prez

05:41.159 --> 05:45.789
that maybe the inner city
could benefit from the benign neglect.

05:45.872 --> 05:47.081
Benign what?

05:47.165 --> 05:50.501
It's... it's the benign neglect.

05:50.584 --> 05:52.253
What it means is this:

05:53.254 --> 05:56.590
Maybe if we just leave
that Luke Cage cat alone,

05:56.674 --> 06:00.303
give him his side of the street,
we take ours.

06:03.222 --> 06:04.849
[shouting]

06:21.866 --> 06:24.035
Benign neglect.

06:24.118 --> 06:25.786
[laughing]

06:26.787 --> 06:29.040
Yeah, okay. [chuckling]

06:32.751 --> 06:34.670
The police sitting on my money.

06:35.421 --> 06:37.841
So I'm gonna have to turn up my game.

06:37.924 --> 06:41.469
Zip... I want you
and the fellas to hit the streets.

06:42.386 --> 06:45.932
Hit every business from 110 to 155th.

06:46.015 --> 06:48.351
If they got a dime,
I want at least a nickel.

06:49.018 --> 06:51.104
Bring everything back
by the end of the day.

06:51.187 --> 06:55.108
You think you're gonna recoup $7 million,
just like that?

06:56.775 --> 06:59.445
I don't even know why you back here.

07:01.990 --> 07:03.491
Look around.

07:04.951 --> 07:07.954
You know damn well
why Diamondback sent me.

07:09.663 --> 07:10.999
Fort Knox?

07:14.460 --> 07:16.504
This makes the junkyard rip...

07:17.713 --> 07:20.299
look like Amateur Night at the Apollo.

07:21.759 --> 07:26.389
This dishwasher...
thinks he can prove Harlem don't need me.

07:28.557 --> 07:31.727
Let's see how bad
he really wants to wear the crown.

07:37.358 --> 07:39.193
You hit the boulevard
and squeeze 'em hard.

07:40.611 --> 07:44.782
And when they start crying,
talking about, "Why? Why?"

07:46.242 --> 07:50.329
You tell them to go talk
to Luke Cage down at the barber shop.

07:50.413 --> 07:53.124
They're paying
a Luke Cage stupidity tax.

07:53.207 --> 07:55.376
[breathing heavily]

07:55.459 --> 07:57.295
[shouting] What are you doing?

07:58.421 --> 07:59.881
Time is precious!

07:59.964 --> 08:01.299
Move!

08:02.508 --> 08:03.842
Zip!

08:06.720 --> 08:08.181
Call Mr. Spurlock.

08:14.228 --> 08:16.272
Tell him we gonna need his services.

08:31.037 --> 08:32.956
- [both grunting]
- Get off!

08:33.039 --> 08:34.916
[grunting]

08:45.009 --> 08:47.720
- You got problems with the tax?
- Holler at your man Luke Cage...

08:47.803 --> 08:49.722
- Holler at Luke Cage...
- [all] At the barber shop.

08:56.645 --> 08:58.397
[Zip] Payday, Aisha.

08:58.481 --> 09:00.191
We ain't got it this month, Zip.

09:00.274 --> 09:01.275
[Zip chuckles]

09:02.151 --> 09:03.569
Back off.

09:03.652 --> 09:05.989
- [scoffs] Give me that.
- [both straining]

09:06.530 --> 09:08.532
- [Aisha screams]
- [laughing]

09:08.616 --> 09:10.159
What the hell are you doing, Zip?

09:10.243 --> 09:11.535
[Aisha yelling]

09:16.958 --> 09:18.042
Ooh.

09:19.418 --> 09:21.462
Didn't your old man come up on the Mets?

09:21.545 --> 09:22.671
He got cut.

09:22.755 --> 09:24.673
He played for the championship
New York Nines team.

09:26.175 --> 09:27.468
That's a Nine's ring?

09:27.551 --> 09:28.886
Zip, please.

09:29.637 --> 09:31.555
That's my father's!

09:33.641 --> 09:35.018
[Zip chuckling]

09:35.684 --> 09:37.853
[Zip] Aw! Don't cry.

09:37.936 --> 09:39.688
[chuckling] You mad?

09:39.772 --> 09:42.150
Holler at Luke Cage.

09:42.233 --> 09:44.360
He'll tell you why we doin' this.

09:53.036 --> 09:55.163
- A tailor?
- That ain't no tailor.

09:55.246 --> 09:57.706
That's Dapper Dan himself.

09:57.790 --> 09:59.625
Dapper Dan?

09:59.708 --> 10:01.044
[chuckles]

10:01.127 --> 10:03.837
Said you needed a suit,
that's why I had you come here.

10:05.423 --> 10:06.840
And I figure...

10:06.924 --> 10:09.135
Pop would want you to come
to his memorial correct,

10:09.218 --> 10:12.388
so I used a little bit of money
to have my man Dap do you right.

10:13.597 --> 10:14.765
[chuckling]

10:41.959 --> 10:44.837
[Dapper Dan] Saw you on TV
the other night. Buried alive.

10:44.920 --> 10:47.506
Now that's what I call style.

10:47.590 --> 10:51.052
- [Luke] Lucky.
- You ain't lucky. You blessed.

10:56.349 --> 10:58.726
Hey. What was Mike Tyson like?

10:58.809 --> 11:01.354
[Fish chuckling] Oh, I know
you're sick of telling that story.

11:01.437 --> 11:03.231
He whooped Mitch Green's behind,
didn't he?

11:03.314 --> 11:06.359
[scoffs] Mike Tyson
is a real nice guy, man.

11:06.442 --> 11:07.985
But he hit like a beast.

11:08.069 --> 11:10.613
Yeah, well there was beauty in that beast.

11:10.696 --> 11:15.159
You can't control what people say.
Just be the best man that you can be.

11:16.244 --> 11:18.537
And always make sure
they spell your name right.

11:20.956 --> 11:22.666
[Luke] Now, that's a dapper approach, man.

11:22.750 --> 11:25.294
- Thanks, man.
- Appreciate it.

11:29.132 --> 11:30.633
Let's see here.

11:31.592 --> 11:33.344
[both chuckling]

11:33.427 --> 11:35.179
That ain't no smock.

11:36.930 --> 11:39.392
- You ready for later?
- All good.

11:39.475 --> 11:41.894
Messages stacked up at the door.

11:41.977 --> 11:45.356
Like everybody in Harlem
looking for you after that building thing.

11:46.315 --> 11:48.359
I'm strictly about Pop's memorial today.

11:48.442 --> 11:50.903
[sighing] Seating everyone at this thing

11:50.986 --> 11:53.071
is gonna be the toughest move
I've mastered

11:53.156 --> 11:55.366
since the Blackmar-Diemer Gambit.

11:55.449 --> 11:57.075
[sighing] I mean...

11:58.076 --> 12:00.996
I gotta put Estelle up front,
'cause she's been with him the longest,

12:01.079 --> 12:03.416
at least as far as the neighborhood knows.

12:04.750 --> 12:08.045
Keep her far away as hell from Charlene.

12:08.128 --> 12:13.342
She's real sly. Moves like a bishop
on the diagonal at all times.

12:13.426 --> 12:16.053
Now, they both
have to steer clear of Candy,

12:16.136 --> 12:18.722
who they both think is his cousin.
[chuckles]

12:18.806 --> 12:20.474
Candy?

12:20.558 --> 12:23.436
She rubs everyone the wrong way but Pop.

12:23.519 --> 12:27.356
Who she rubs the right way,
every Tuesday and Thursday at 9:45.

12:27.440 --> 12:28.899
[chuckling]

12:29.858 --> 12:32.570
Looks like Shaft ain't had nothing
on Henry Hunter.

12:32.653 --> 12:34.488
- Pop was a mack.
- [scoffing]

12:34.572 --> 12:36.699
If that's what you wanna call it.

12:38.576 --> 12:41.912
He would want you to have
his apartment upstairs.

12:41.995 --> 12:45.208
Uh, especially since your crib blew up.

12:53.716 --> 12:56.219
I'll earn my keep somehow.

12:56.302 --> 12:58.178
Goddamn right you will.

12:59.012 --> 13:02.015
We fix this place up,
the doors gotta reopen.

13:03.601 --> 13:06.103
- Talk for another day.
- Cool.

13:08.146 --> 13:10.691
- Luke Cage here yet?
- Whoa, slow down, Aisha.

13:10.774 --> 13:12.235
- What's wrong?
- [Luke] I'm Luke.

13:12.318 --> 13:15.529
What you got to do with all this shit
happening up and down Lenox Avenue?

13:15.613 --> 13:16.905
What are you talking about?

13:16.989 --> 13:18.741
Zip snatched my daddy's championship ring

13:18.824 --> 13:21.452
and hit about 20 other spots
all over uptown.

13:21.535 --> 13:23.371
- Why?
- I don't care why.

13:23.454 --> 13:25.080
You need to get my daddy's ring back.

13:25.163 --> 13:27.666
You remember what he was like
before he got strung out?

13:27.750 --> 13:29.502
Eddie's a good dude deep down.

13:30.461 --> 13:32.880
To me, what's left of him is that ring.

13:32.963 --> 13:36.467
The only reason why he didn't pawn it is
because I took it away from him.

13:36.550 --> 13:39.052
Somebody's gotta protect his legacy.

13:39.136 --> 13:41.555
- Even if he won't.
- [sighing]

13:41.639 --> 13:44.182
Let me get into this.
See what the hell's going on.

13:44.267 --> 13:46.894
Get into it?
You need to check these dudes!

13:46.977 --> 13:48.854
Everybody heard about
what you did in the projects.

13:48.937 --> 13:51.899
Don't be a punk and just stand by.

14:01.659 --> 14:03.286
Different kind of chess gambit.

14:04.161 --> 14:08.165
Cottonmouth figures if he can't drop you,
he'll get Harlem to push you out.

14:08.248 --> 14:09.750
Where you going?

14:09.833 --> 14:12.420
To make sure Cottonmouth
spells my name right.

14:15.130 --> 14:17.591
They smashed all my displays!

14:17.675 --> 14:19.593
Yo, they took my Les Paul.
That's my life.

14:19.677 --> 14:20.761
Jacked me for my tips!

14:20.844 --> 14:23.138
- I'm on it!
- [woman] I work hard for that money.

14:23.221 --> 14:24.473
I'm on it!

14:32.481 --> 14:34.567
[Soledad] Hey, you're late.

14:34.650 --> 14:36.860
What? I got robbed.

14:36.944 --> 14:39.280
Some guy stole my bag.
I had to whoop his ass.

14:40.823 --> 14:42.408
What were you thinking?

14:42.491 --> 14:44.702
I was thinking that I wanted my bag back.

14:44.785 --> 14:46.495
- He could have killed you.
- [tsks]

14:46.579 --> 14:48.581
<i>Mami,</i> please. I grew up here.

14:48.664 --> 14:51.792
If you don't fight back,
they make you into a doormat.

14:53.336 --> 14:55.296
You know who taught me that? You.

14:56.505 --> 14:58.048
Things have changed up here, <i>mija.</i>

14:58.131 --> 14:59.842
Things have changed everywhere.

15:00.968 --> 15:02.303
Is...

15:02.386 --> 15:04.555
Is why you came back home?

15:05.473 --> 15:08.266
I wanted to come back
where things made sense, yeah.

15:12.438 --> 15:13.814
What the... [groans]

15:13.897 --> 15:15.316
[grunts]

15:15.399 --> 15:17.443
- Where is he?
- Who?

15:17.526 --> 15:18.902
Les Paul.

15:31.874 --> 15:33.334
- Those two?
- Yeah.

15:33.417 --> 15:36.128
- Let's go talk to them.
- Don't you need a gun?

15:36.211 --> 15:37.463
I am the gun.

15:38.506 --> 15:40.674
Yo, Plug One, Plug Two.

15:40.758 --> 15:42.468
What is this? Your boyfriend?

15:42.551 --> 15:43.802
You want some of this? [grunting]

15:46.179 --> 15:47.806
[woman scoffs]

15:49.266 --> 15:50.851
You know my name?

15:50.934 --> 15:52.478
That's Luke Cage, asshole.

15:52.561 --> 15:55.981
The next time you say my name...
I'm coming for you.

15:57.024 --> 15:58.275
Now, when you wake up,

15:58.359 --> 16:00.819
I want you to tell everybody
that you've been screwing with

16:00.903 --> 16:04.365
that they got nothing to fear
from Cottonmouth, you understand?

16:04.448 --> 16:05.866
Wake up? [grunts]

16:22.633 --> 16:24.092
[man groaning]

16:25.886 --> 16:28.639
I can't believe that bitch shot me.

16:28.722 --> 16:31.058
Got a name on that "bitch" who shot you?

16:32.267 --> 16:34.437
I ain't say I got shot.

16:34.520 --> 16:36.188
No snitching, huh?

16:39.983 --> 16:41.610
You remember me from Genghis Connie's?

16:42.778 --> 16:44.112
Oh, shit.

16:45.113 --> 16:46.990
What happened? Who shot you?

16:47.074 --> 16:49.410
I'm going back to Raleigh.

16:49.493 --> 16:51.078
I've had enough of this shit.

16:51.161 --> 16:52.455
[groans]

16:54.623 --> 16:56.750
You ain't moving fast enough.

16:56.834 --> 16:58.794
Aisha ain't like the others.

16:58.877 --> 17:01.213
She wants that ring back.

17:01.296 --> 17:02.756
You gotta understand.

17:02.840 --> 17:07.260
When her father was sick,
she came up in the streets all by herself.

17:07.344 --> 17:09.597
She's tougher than she looks.

17:09.680 --> 17:10.973
Aisha shot that dude?

17:11.973 --> 17:15.519
He was with Zip. He laughed at her,
and talked trash about the ring.

17:15.603 --> 17:17.311
Where'd she get the gun?

17:18.606 --> 17:20.608
Yo, I plead the eighth.

17:20.691 --> 17:22.609
You mean the fifth.

17:22.693 --> 17:25.237
Yeah, that shit. I plead the fifth.

17:27.948 --> 17:29.116
Where is she?

17:30.075 --> 17:31.744
Check the shop on St. Nick.

17:31.827 --> 17:34.497
If she ain't there,
your guess is as good as mine.

17:38.000 --> 17:40.836
Don't you get tired of hanging out
near crime scenes?

17:42.463 --> 17:43.839
Who's this?

17:47.009 --> 17:49.094
Is this is what you were
looking for this morning?

17:49.177 --> 17:52.681
Uh-uh. It's evidence.
Part of my investigation.

17:52.765 --> 17:54.517
- That's my property.
- Too bad.

17:54.600 --> 17:56.644
Is she the reason rockets
keep getting dropped on your head?

17:57.478 --> 18:00.230
A good cop would ask the person
doing the shooting that question.

18:00.313 --> 18:02.315
Oh, yeah, wise guy?
Well, how about this?

18:02.399 --> 18:04.276
What's going on
between you and Cottonmouth?

18:06.194 --> 18:08.697
He didn't like the way
I was washing dishes and he fired me.

18:08.781 --> 18:11.366
Chaos rolls off you like water off a duck.

18:11.449 --> 18:13.285
But it's gotta stop.

18:13.368 --> 18:14.787
Innocent people are getting hurt.

18:14.870 --> 18:17.831
Either be a part of the solution
or leave.

18:17.915 --> 18:20.333
I will. I'll leave.

18:20.417 --> 18:22.335
But first, I gotta do right by Pop.

18:26.131 --> 18:27.550
[Misty] Hey!

18:28.676 --> 18:31.136
- You going to Pop's memorial?
- Yeah.

18:31.219 --> 18:32.513
Don't.

18:41.396 --> 18:43.231
[Shades] You need to let this go.

18:44.316 --> 18:45.526
No.

18:46.234 --> 18:48.195
It makes you look weak.

18:49.822 --> 18:51.532
I can't ignore him.

18:52.950 --> 18:54.952
You can't let this dude drive you stupid.

18:55.035 --> 18:59.122
It only helps his name ring out...
like yours used to.

19:01.291 --> 19:02.918
[sighing] All right...

19:04.628 --> 19:07.214
Mr. Gangster Consultant.

19:07.297 --> 19:08.799
Take your shot.

19:08.882 --> 19:11.301
- What would you do?
- Sell this club.

19:11.384 --> 19:14.429
You can net three mil, easy,
on the real estate alone.

19:14.512 --> 19:16.014
Not happening.

19:17.766 --> 19:20.143
No one black has ever
done anything like this.

19:21.144 --> 19:23.981
Percy Sutton came close,
but that was years ago.

19:27.109 --> 19:29.319
Harlem's Paradise is special.

19:31.446 --> 19:33.531
And it's not going nowhere.

19:35.659 --> 19:38.161
If you don't make the right moves now...

19:38.245 --> 19:39.913
you are done.

19:44.960 --> 19:47.087
This place is my reputation.

19:50.548 --> 19:52.009
My blood.

19:53.969 --> 19:55.721
My legacy.

20:04.437 --> 20:05.773
[scoffs]

20:07.775 --> 20:09.567
He's here.

20:28.420 --> 20:30.588
You guys? Again?

20:36.136 --> 20:37.220
[Stokes] There he is.

20:39.472 --> 20:41.266
Dishwasher Lazarus.

20:42.142 --> 20:43.936
You want your old job back?

20:46.604 --> 20:49.858
Costs to be a savior. Ask Jesus.

20:49.942 --> 20:53.445
You started all this.
This is me finishing it.

20:53.528 --> 20:56.281
You want Harlem? It's expensive.

20:56.364 --> 21:00.661
I don't want Harlem.
I just want you to stop messing with it.

21:01.912 --> 21:03.496
This is my home.

21:04.622 --> 21:06.750
You don't know a damn thing about it.

21:11.129 --> 21:12.881
- [grunting]
- [bone breaking]

21:14.174 --> 21:15.342
- [yells]
- [bone cracks]

21:15.425 --> 21:16.802
[groaning]

21:20.055 --> 21:21.598
[bullet ricocheting]

21:25.435 --> 21:26.687
[grunting]

21:29.397 --> 21:31.233
Carl Lucas?

21:32.525 --> 21:34.277
[Stokes] Whoa! Whoa!

21:39.616 --> 21:41.243
It's called deductive reasoning.

21:42.202 --> 21:46.498
If a rocket launcher couldn't stop me...
what's that little peashooter gonna do?

21:47.540 --> 21:49.417
You wanna go to war?

21:50.878 --> 21:51.962
Hmm?

21:54.172 --> 21:56.174
I'll take you to war.

21:56.258 --> 21:58.301
You don't have enough people.

21:59.011 --> 22:00.470
This mob's not deep enough.

22:01.471 --> 22:03.140
Ask your man, Shades.

22:03.223 --> 22:04.933
You're supposed to be dead.

22:05.976 --> 22:07.644
You can't kill me.

22:09.938 --> 22:11.398
Keep my name out your mouth.

22:14.735 --> 22:16.236
Or what?

22:17.570 --> 22:19.239
[inhales deeply]

22:31.626 --> 22:33.128
You know this son of a bitch?

22:34.004 --> 22:35.713
It's a long story.

22:36.381 --> 22:37.966
I'll make time.

22:49.186 --> 22:50.520
- Don't do that.
- What?

22:51.313 --> 22:52.772
Worried I'm gonna spill it?

22:53.731 --> 22:55.775
<i>Mami,</i> you're so superstitious.

22:56.693 --> 22:58.153
And you're not?

23:02.699 --> 23:04.659
There's more to this than superstition.

23:09.331 --> 23:11.624
That's a kind of yes/no thing.

23:15.545 --> 23:17.005
There's a middle ground.

23:18.798 --> 23:20.300
Unexplainable.

23:23.720 --> 23:27.182
The hospital was attacked by men in masks.

23:27.265 --> 23:32.604
And the one I took down had a scar...
like from an autopsy.

23:32.687 --> 23:37.067
Like he had died
and come back to life once before.

23:37.150 --> 23:40.112
And his friends
broke in and killed Louisa.

23:40.778 --> 23:42.739
The hospital wants to cover it up.

23:43.866 --> 23:46.869
They're saying that
a junkie stabbed Louisa.

23:47.660 --> 23:50.914
I was gonna go to the cops,
so they gave me a choice.

23:52.540 --> 23:54.584
Actually, it wasn't a choice at all.

23:56.586 --> 23:58.255
I'm glad you came home.

23:59.839 --> 24:01.716
I kinda had to.

24:01.799 --> 24:05.095
Metro-General pretty much made sure
I can't work anywhere else in New York.

24:05.888 --> 24:07.890
What would make you happy?

24:10.142 --> 24:12.185
I've seen a man...

24:12.269 --> 24:14.812
a blind man who can see,

24:14.897 --> 24:17.857
because his other senses
are so amplified.

24:19.651 --> 24:23.863
And this other man who survived
a shotgun blast to his head

24:23.947 --> 24:26.950
and recovered from a brain hemorrhage
in a few hours.

24:27.034 --> 24:29.244
And they both needed my help.

24:30.245 --> 24:32.205
I think that's what I want to do.

24:34.249 --> 24:35.875
Is help people...

24:36.960 --> 24:38.711
with abilities.

24:41.381 --> 24:47.012
You know what
your <i>abuela</i> said about these things?

24:49.181 --> 24:52.976
Well, you know I don't believe
in that Santeria mumbo jumbo.

24:53.726 --> 24:58.315
She was a <i>curandera,</i> not a priestess.

25:00.067 --> 25:03.528
The world isn't the world anymore, <i>mija.</i>

25:04.988 --> 25:08.033
Aliens coming out of the sky.

25:08.116 --> 25:10.994
- People with silver hammers.
- [Claire sighs]

25:11.703 --> 25:13.288
Green monsters.

25:15.332 --> 25:19.586
All I know is...
everything happens for a reason.

25:21.046 --> 25:25.258
And now, somehow... you're a part of it.

25:27.594 --> 25:29.679
What do you call that?

25:29.762 --> 25:32.307
[sighing] The worst luck in the world.

25:33.808 --> 25:36.436
It's called fate.

25:40.607 --> 25:44.236
[men grunting and gun firing
on television]

25:45.153 --> 25:46.821
That's Carl Lucas.

25:48.406 --> 25:51.326
I did time with him at Seagate Prison
when I first got there.

25:51.409 --> 25:55.830
Rackham, captain of the guards,
he had us work him over real good.

25:55.913 --> 25:58.416
There's no way
he could've survived in one piece.

25:59.584 --> 26:04.006
This nigga's half Houdini, half Ali.

26:04.797 --> 26:06.591
There's a bullet for everyone.

26:07.800 --> 26:09.344
Diamondback taught me that.

26:10.303 --> 26:11.888
Say what?

26:11.971 --> 26:13.890
I got something to show you.

26:17.102 --> 26:19.021
[man speaking Polish]

26:20.772 --> 26:22.482
Russian?

26:22.565 --> 26:24.234
Ukrainian, I think.

26:24.317 --> 26:25.902
Eastern European connection.

26:29.531 --> 26:31.324
[Stokes] Kevlar?

26:31.408 --> 26:33.493
[Shades]
Must have a South American hookup.

26:33.576 --> 26:35.912
It's heavy duty. Military grade.

26:37.330 --> 26:39.082
[speaking Polish]

26:45.630 --> 26:46.923
[gunshot]

26:47.006 --> 26:48.633
[man groaning]

26:50.052 --> 26:51.511
This ain't shit.

26:51.594 --> 26:52.762
- Wait for it.
- [whirring]

26:52.845 --> 26:54.764
- Wait for it.
- [muffled explosion]

26:58.101 --> 26:59.977
[exclaiming]

27:00.062 --> 27:02.439
That is the illest shit
I've ever seen in my life!

27:02.522 --> 27:04.649
Are you serious?

27:04.732 --> 27:06.818
Based on a prototype by Hammer.

27:06.901 --> 27:10.238
The rounds are a composite,
invisible to metal detectors.

27:10.322 --> 27:13.825
And they incinerate forensic evidence,
so they are untraceable.

27:15.910 --> 27:17.787
What kind of metal does that?

27:19.247 --> 27:20.707
Nothing from this Earth.

27:21.874 --> 27:24.836
- The incident?
- That's what I hear.

27:24.919 --> 27:27.046
Yo...

27:27.130 --> 27:28.756
if you wanted to kill Jesus...

27:30.383 --> 27:31.759
that's the bullet you'd use.

27:31.843 --> 27:34.053
That's why they call it the Judas.

27:34.137 --> 27:38.975
Hmm... I can think of a few fools
I'd love to baptize with that joint.

27:39.058 --> 27:40.727
[laughing]

27:42.645 --> 27:44.147
How do I get 'em?

27:45.064 --> 27:46.524
One of two ways.

27:47.525 --> 27:49.068
You pay for it.

27:50.695 --> 27:53.823
Or you ask Diamondback
to handle Carl Lucas for you.

27:55.950 --> 27:58.120
I don't need Diamondback
to handle my problems.

27:58.203 --> 27:59.829
[inhaling sharply]

27:59.912 --> 28:01.581
How much for the damn thing?

28:13.301 --> 28:14.886
- Per bullet?
- Mmm-hmm.

28:14.969 --> 28:16.429
For real?

28:19.056 --> 28:20.225
God damn it.

28:21.184 --> 28:23.770
Diamondback can front me.
I'm good for it.

28:23.853 --> 28:26.189
He ain't gonna front you a dime.

28:26.273 --> 28:28.275
You made too many mistakes.

28:29.484 --> 28:30.860
He told you that?

28:31.944 --> 28:33.488
Does he have to?

28:35.365 --> 28:36.866
[chuckling]

28:36.949 --> 28:38.743
I'll call him my damn self.

28:42.372 --> 28:44.207
He ain't the same Diamondback.

28:46.334 --> 28:50.004
If he does you this favor...
he's taking Harlem from you.

28:52.757 --> 28:54.467
I'm just letting you know.

29:09.691 --> 29:14.028
I'll get Domingo his guns,
square everything away...

29:15.363 --> 29:17.324
so Diamondback can front me the loan.

29:18.241 --> 29:21.369
Then I'll kill Cage
so shit can get back to normal.

29:23.413 --> 29:25.081
Let me make a few phone calls.

29:26.416 --> 29:28.251
- My man.
- Hmm.

29:38.428 --> 29:39.929
Hey, Captain.

29:40.847 --> 29:43.433
We need to talk, seriously.

29:44.976 --> 29:46.769
What's the problem?

29:46.853 --> 29:48.145
Scarfe.

29:48.230 --> 29:49.981
IAB hasn't officially said anything,

29:50.064 --> 29:53.360
but someone I trust is telling me
he's under investigation.

29:53.443 --> 29:54.569
What?

29:56.321 --> 29:58.990
[scoffs] Look, I've been riding
with Scarfe for years.

29:59.073 --> 30:00.908
Is he salty? Yeah.

30:00.992 --> 30:02.744
But dirty? Never.

30:02.827 --> 30:06.623
We have a lot of eyes on us, Misty.
Can't take any chances.

30:06.706 --> 30:08.291
What's this based on?

30:09.292 --> 30:11.878
The night of the restaurant explosion
and Crispus Attucks raid,

30:11.961 --> 30:14.839
you and your partner logged into
the crime scene 40 minutes apart.

30:14.922 --> 30:16.216
So?

30:16.299 --> 30:18.175
In the time that was unaccounted for,

30:18.260 --> 30:20.553
your only source of information
for the barber shop shooting,

30:20.637 --> 30:22.138
Chico Diaz, went missing.

30:22.222 --> 30:23.931
He was last seen with Scarfe.

30:24.891 --> 30:26.768
That's not true.

30:26.851 --> 30:30.187
Scarfe left the precinct to pick up Chico,
but Chico was gone.

30:31.188 --> 30:34.984
So, he picks up a witness unsupervised,
which is against protocol,

30:35.067 --> 30:36.569
doesn't even log it in,

30:36.653 --> 30:39.822
and he still has time to get
to Genghis Connie's before anyone else.

30:39.906 --> 30:41.198
What, is he clairvoyant?

30:41.283 --> 30:42.867
He's not telling you everything.

30:43.493 --> 30:45.828
Look, they are wasting their time on this.

30:46.746 --> 30:48.080
[Scarfe] Good news.

30:49.206 --> 30:50.917
Gyro guy's back.

30:51.000 --> 30:54.170
Got your nasty, mystery meat for you.

30:54.254 --> 30:55.755
Veggie for me.

30:57.590 --> 31:00.718
Captain, LT.
Y'all hitting on my partner again?

31:00.802 --> 31:03.137
[Perez scoffs] She's fair game
when you ain't around.

31:03.220 --> 31:04.431
[Scarfe chuckles]

31:04.514 --> 31:08.560
Let me know when you have something that,
uh, we might be able to use, Detective.

31:13.022 --> 31:14.482
What was that about?

31:16.067 --> 31:17.610
Luke Cage.

31:17.694 --> 31:21.197
They think we're losing sight
of Cottonmouth by focusing on him.

31:21.281 --> 31:25.952
That's what happens when you start hawking
raffle tickets in your own precinct.

31:26.035 --> 31:27.662
You forget how to do police work.

31:29.622 --> 31:31.666
Hey. When I get back from the memorial,

31:31.749 --> 31:34.961
you good with going over all the shit
that's gone down since Crispus Attucks?

31:35.044 --> 31:37.672
Sure.
I'll get started while you're gone.

31:37.755 --> 31:39.549
Go say goodbye to your friend.

31:46.931 --> 31:48.350
[phone ringing]

31:53.480 --> 31:54.772
Scarfe.

31:57.442 --> 31:59.444
Yeah, got it. [exhaling sharply]

31:59.527 --> 32:01.654
Y'all ready, baby? [chuckles]

32:01.738 --> 32:03.740
Let's do it.

32:03.823 --> 32:06.368
Whoo! Give it to me, baby. [chuckles]

32:06.451 --> 32:08.745
Oh! Thank you.

32:08.828 --> 32:10.955
[laughing] Whoo!

32:12.123 --> 32:13.290
Whoo!

32:13.375 --> 32:14.792
[Zip] That's it, that's it.
[man] Man, take my money.

32:14.876 --> 32:17.337
[Zip] The banker, baby,
that's what they call me.

32:17.420 --> 32:19.171
[man 1] Double or nothing.
[man 2] Bettin' six, bettin' six.

32:19.255 --> 32:22.174
[conversation continues indistinctly]

32:22.258 --> 32:23.385
Damn.

32:23.468 --> 32:26.763
You guys actually take lunch breaks
like real employees, huh?

32:29.432 --> 32:31.559
Any of you guys at Crispus Attucks
the other night?

32:31.643 --> 32:33.603
- Uh... uh-uh.
- Nah, man.

32:39.108 --> 32:41.235
[scoffs] Like I need these bitches.

32:41.318 --> 32:42.945
[gun cocking]

32:46.991 --> 32:48.451
[bullet ricocheting]

33:00.963 --> 33:02.882
[choking]

33:02.965 --> 33:05.552
Aisha's ring. You got it?

33:07.011 --> 33:08.262
[groaning]

33:08.345 --> 33:10.515
Think about where you are.

33:12.058 --> 33:14.644
It's hallowed ground... this park.

33:15.645 --> 33:17.229
Named for Jackie Robinson.

33:18.230 --> 33:19.607
[grunting]

33:21.358 --> 33:24.195
It's here. It's all around you...

33:24.278 --> 33:26.531
if you respect yourself enough
to take a look.

33:26.614 --> 33:28.199
At what?

33:29.283 --> 33:30.410
Our legacy.

33:30.493 --> 33:31.828
[choking]

33:37.041 --> 33:38.125
[Zip grunting]

33:51.431 --> 33:53.808
[Perez sighs] I don't know
what the hell you've been doing,

33:53.891 --> 33:55.226
but IA's onto you,

33:55.309 --> 33:57.520
and they've given the captain a heads-up.

33:57.604 --> 33:59.355
You're being investigated, Scarfe.

33:59.439 --> 34:02.108
Captain was poking around Misty,
seeing what she knows.

34:02.191 --> 34:06.112
But... we've got bigger problems than IA.

34:07.572 --> 34:11.451
Cottonmouth needs Domingo's guns
from evidence. Now.

34:11.534 --> 34:13.828
Goddamn Cottonmouth.

34:15.871 --> 34:17.081
What do you suggest?

34:19.458 --> 34:21.460
It'd be easier just to kill him.

34:23.129 --> 34:24.630
Not really.

34:24.714 --> 34:26.799
We don't know if he's got a backup plan.

34:26.882 --> 34:29.176
You better have a backup plan
for getting them guns.

34:30.136 --> 34:32.804
[Perez] <i>I got Sergeant MacClean</i>
<i>from property on it.</i>

34:33.764 --> 34:35.766
[Scarfe] <i>MacClean?</i>

34:35.850 --> 34:38.770
<i>That fat donut-eating bastard</i>
<i>is gonna get us burnt.</i>

34:38.853 --> 34:41.147
[Perez] <i>We'll be fine. He's on payroll.</i>

34:41.230 --> 34:42.815
<i>If we go down, he goes down.</i>

34:49.071 --> 34:50.364
[exhales]

35:05.838 --> 35:08.090
[Luke] Aisha, I got something for you.

35:20.019 --> 35:21.604
You with them stickup boys?

35:23.565 --> 35:25.149
- No.
- Good.

35:26.275 --> 35:28.110
'Cause we ain't got shit left.

35:31.113 --> 35:33.407
[Luke] I'm sorry about
what happened to your shop.

35:34.491 --> 35:36.368
Back in the days, people had respect.

35:37.411 --> 35:39.496
I seen 'em all come and go.

35:39.581 --> 35:43.125
Nicky. Fritz. Azie.

35:43.209 --> 35:45.002
It's always been wild.

35:46.087 --> 35:49.256
But people
carried groceries for old ladies.

35:49.340 --> 35:51.217
Your name meant something.

35:52.844 --> 35:55.471
Maybe that's why they call it
"back in the day."

35:57.640 --> 35:59.183
You're Eddie?

36:01.185 --> 36:03.104
The one and only.

36:03.187 --> 36:04.731
I need to find your daughter.

36:05.898 --> 36:09.569
She still carrying on about that ring?
It ain't worth shit.

36:11.487 --> 36:14.031
Maybe it reminds her of better times...

36:15.783 --> 36:17.493
back in the day.

36:26.335 --> 36:27.920
What about your father?

36:28.838 --> 36:30.798
Did he play the game?

36:30.882 --> 36:32.341
Of course.

36:32.424 --> 36:34.802
Baseball is a game
passed from father to son.

36:35.803 --> 36:38.389
That's why you don't see no niggas
playing the game no more.

36:38.472 --> 36:40.099
'Cause all the fathers is gone.

36:41.267 --> 36:42.685
[scoffs]

36:44.520 --> 36:47.148
Aisha's the one
had the idea for this damn shop.

36:48.733 --> 36:50.777
Said I could sign some autographs...

36:51.861 --> 36:53.905
and keep my hands on something positive.

36:54.989 --> 36:58.575
I said,
"Baby, everything I touch turns to shit."

36:59.744 --> 37:01.578
She never did listen.

37:07.334 --> 37:09.253
Quit letting her down.

37:10.379 --> 37:13.758
If she comes back...
tell her Luke Cage came by.

37:15.176 --> 37:16.761
I need to see her.

37:19.471 --> 37:20.932
You him, huh?

37:22.016 --> 37:24.060
Your name is all over Harlem today.

37:25.019 --> 37:26.688
Not in a good way.

37:28.064 --> 37:29.857
I'm about to change that.

37:31.025 --> 37:32.735
You should do the same.

37:35.863 --> 37:37.073
[door closes]

37:46.457 --> 37:47.583
That's him.

37:48.500 --> 37:51.170
- [Soledad] Who?
- [Claire] Luke.

37:51.253 --> 37:54.548
Oh, he's trouble.
He reminds me of your father.

37:55.675 --> 37:58.635
Yo, that's Luke Cage.

37:58.720 --> 38:01.305
- You know him?
- Yeah. From the barber shop.

38:01.388 --> 38:03.140
He's for real.

38:35.547 --> 38:36.924
Shit.

38:40.636 --> 38:43.347
Sorry, Pop. You got me.

39:12.043 --> 39:13.044
Hi.

39:14.628 --> 39:16.547
You know the man?

39:55.795 --> 39:57.338
[cell phone chiming]

40:29.245 --> 40:31.247
I never really knew my father.

40:32.664 --> 40:34.708
I always said that...

40:34.791 --> 40:36.585
outside of my conception...

40:38.129 --> 40:39.713
he was never there for me.

40:41.507 --> 40:44.969
It got easier and easier

40:45.887 --> 40:47.304
to think of him as dead.

40:48.222 --> 40:49.806
And now that he is...

40:50.682 --> 40:52.643
I need him.

40:52.726 --> 40:54.645
More than ever.

40:54.728 --> 40:56.272
[shakily] I was gonna tell him...

40:57.273 --> 40:59.150
I've got one on the way.

41:00.109 --> 41:01.318
He's a grandfather.

41:03.529 --> 41:06.365
I just hope that
by being in my son's life...

41:07.616 --> 41:09.326
I'm able to do the things that...

41:10.995 --> 41:13.664
seems like Pop did for everybody else.

41:24.383 --> 41:26.052
Aisha.

41:26.135 --> 41:27.929
I took care of it.

41:29.138 --> 41:30.973
You don't have to do anything else.

41:31.765 --> 41:34.601
And take your hand... out of your purse.

41:44.236 --> 41:46.572
Would anyone else like to say anything?

41:48.950 --> 41:50.701
[Stokes] I have a few words.

42:01.045 --> 42:02.379
[clearing throat]

42:07.718 --> 42:09.971
Henry Hunter was my mentor...

42:10.054 --> 42:12.223
[inhales deeply]

42:12.306 --> 42:13.933
and oldest friend.

42:15.059 --> 42:16.936
Taught me streets the hard way.

42:17.811 --> 42:19.396
Y'all don't remember
the sound of his fist,

42:19.480 --> 42:21.190
but that's how he got his name.

42:21.273 --> 42:22.608
[chuckling] Pop.

42:25.194 --> 42:26.653
But he changed.

42:27.989 --> 42:29.156
He evolved.

42:29.240 --> 42:31.117
[all agreeing]

42:31.200 --> 42:32.784
You see, Harlem would do that to you.

42:33.535 --> 42:37.581
Where some people saw a war zone,
Pop always saw a pasture.

42:37.664 --> 42:43.545
A breeding ground for artistry...
greatness.

42:43.629 --> 42:45.797
[all agreeing]

42:45.881 --> 42:47.508
From Billy Strayhorn...

42:48.717 --> 42:51.678
Teddy Riley, Big L, A$AP Rocky.

42:51.762 --> 42:53.305
All those brothers...

42:54.223 --> 42:57.101
came from right here.

42:57.184 --> 42:58.727
[all agreeing]

43:00.271 --> 43:04.733
Roses from the concrete,
all 'cause of people like Pop.

43:06.735 --> 43:10.447
Now, I believe that whatever
doesn't kill you makes you stronger.

43:10.531 --> 43:12.241
And that's how
we got to look at Pop's death.

43:12.324 --> 43:14.118
[all agreeing]

43:16.412 --> 43:18.455
Now, they never caught the shooter.

43:20.582 --> 43:24.295
But I have faith that he is rotting
in the depths of hell.

43:25.296 --> 43:26.797
I miss Pop.

43:28.174 --> 43:31.385
I promise you with all my might...

43:32.469 --> 43:36.348
that even though
we are being attacked from all sides

43:36.432 --> 43:38.642
by foreign interlopers...

43:39.768 --> 43:41.020
strangers...

43:42.229 --> 43:43.397
with arcane abilities...

43:43.480 --> 43:44.981
[all agreeing]

43:49.778 --> 43:51.197
...I promise you...

43:52.114 --> 43:54.450
I stay true to what we have right here.

43:55.701 --> 43:58.537
'Cause that's what Pop woulda wanted.

43:58.620 --> 44:00.164
[all agreeing]

44:00.247 --> 44:02.374
[man] Yes, yes, yes. Yes!

44:21.602 --> 44:22.936
[screams]

44:24.563 --> 44:26.690
[yelling]

44:53.049 --> 44:54.801
I asked Pop once...

44:56.512 --> 45:00.182
why he didn't want people
to curse in his shop.

45:01.183 --> 45:04.478
And why we had
to wear these ugly smocks.

45:04.561 --> 45:06.647
- [people chuckling]
- He said...

45:08.064 --> 45:12.569
"These kids
need to see a man go to work...

45:14.070 --> 45:18.742
every day...
and to be in the presence of men...

45:19.826 --> 45:23.038
in uniform putting in work."

45:23.121 --> 45:24.540
[all agreeing]

45:27.251 --> 45:28.877
I didn't want to walk in late,

45:28.960 --> 45:32.088
but... I was trying to do
what Pop always did.

45:34.383 --> 45:35.634
Help those in need.

45:36.677 --> 45:41.139
And protect them from the forces
that would do them harm.

45:44.017 --> 45:47.062
[inhaling deeply]
At first, it was selfish...

45:48.397 --> 45:50.399
because my name was attached to it.

45:51.024 --> 45:52.693
But then it got bigger.

45:55.070 --> 45:58.949
If we try to protect only ourselves...

45:59.032 --> 46:01.827
without looking out
for those people closest to us...

46:04.037 --> 46:05.331
then we lose.

46:08.584 --> 46:10.711
Pop never forgot his people.

46:11.920 --> 46:14.506
Where some people saw hard rock kids...

46:15.799 --> 46:17.968
he saw precious jewels.

46:18.051 --> 46:23.265
He reminded me that
diamonds are formed by pressure...

46:24.641 --> 46:26.227
covered in dirt.

46:27.311 --> 46:29.020
But then you polish them...

46:29.938 --> 46:31.106
and they shine.

46:31.189 --> 46:32.983
[all agreeing]

46:37.613 --> 46:39.323
[all exclaiming]

46:39.906 --> 46:44.328
Pop saw the shine in everyone
that walked in his barber shop.

46:44.411 --> 46:47.873
He cut their hair.
He listened to their problems.

46:48.540 --> 46:52.043
And he made them feel better
about the world and themselves.

46:53.879 --> 46:57.466
We have to strive on a daily basis...

46:57.549 --> 47:00.010
to do the same for each other.

47:01.553 --> 47:04.556
And sometimes, that's gonna mean
standing up to a bully.

47:04.640 --> 47:06.141
[all agreeing]

47:06.224 --> 47:10.145
Especially...
if he calls himself a friend.

47:10.228 --> 47:13.357
- [all exclaiming]
- [man] Talk about it.

47:16.109 --> 47:17.986
I don't believe in Harlem.

47:19.530 --> 47:24.075
I believe in the people
who make Harlem what it is.

47:24.159 --> 47:25.744
[cheering and applauding]

47:45.931 --> 47:49.017
I believe this... belongs to you.

47:52.228 --> 47:54.147
So, you're one of them, huh?

47:54.731 --> 47:57.150
You mean someone who gives a damn?

47:57.233 --> 47:58.485
Yeah.

47:59.486 --> 48:00.821
[chuckling]

48:03.198 --> 48:05.241
[indistinct chatter]

48:18.046 --> 48:19.297
I was wrong.

48:20.341 --> 48:21.592
I'm glad you came.

48:21.675 --> 48:24.094
Embarrassing you in public
was much better than doing it

48:24.177 --> 48:26.805
behind closed doors
in your cheap-ass club.

48:28.640 --> 48:31.101
Never confuse the battle with the war.

48:34.688 --> 48:36.690
Next suit that gets damaged...

48:37.816 --> 48:39.401
I'm taxing you.

48:41.403 --> 48:43.154
[laughing]

48:45.741 --> 48:47.075
Yes.

48:51.372 --> 48:54.332
Hell of an impression you made in there.

48:54.416 --> 48:55.584
I'm sorry, did you just
pay me a compliment?

48:55.667 --> 48:57.043
No, I didn't.

48:57.127 --> 49:01.339
You need to stop with this pissing contest
before more people get killed.

49:01.423 --> 49:03.133
Maybe if y'all stopped him
in the first place,

49:03.216 --> 49:04.718
no one would've had to die.

49:04.801 --> 49:07.888
I will get him the right way.

49:07.971 --> 49:10.849
- The system will win.
- Forget the system.

49:10.932 --> 49:13.560
Arrests lead to indictments.
And indictments lead to pleas.

49:13.644 --> 49:15.937
There's always a bigger fish,
a bigger angle.

49:16.021 --> 49:17.355
A slap on the wrist.

49:17.439 --> 49:20.901
Boom. Right back in business.
I ain't going for that.

49:20.984 --> 49:22.944
You just started World War III in there.

49:23.028 --> 49:27.198
And your ass might be bulletproof,
but Harlem ain't.

49:27.282 --> 49:29.618
Harlem is gonna suffer.

49:29.701 --> 49:31.578
So if you aren't gonna help us
take him down,

49:31.662 --> 49:33.789
then you need to leave right now, Luke,

49:33.872 --> 49:36.082
before you make things worse.

49:41.129 --> 49:43.674
I'm sorry things couldn't be
different between us.

49:46.051 --> 49:48.011
But I ain't going nowhere.

49:57.896 --> 49:58.980
