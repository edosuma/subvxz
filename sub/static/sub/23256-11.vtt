WEBVTT

00:01.131 --> 00:02.654
- Previously on "Nashville"...

00:02.698 --> 00:05.396
- They have this outreach
program that'’s in Bolivia.

00:05.440 --> 00:07.007
- You don'’t even
know if it'’s safe!

00:07.050 --> 00:08.312
- I can take care of myself.

00:08.356 --> 00:10.053
I think you know that by now.

00:10.097 --> 00:11.489
- Guess I didn'’t realize
how much I'’d like you.

00:11.533 --> 00:12.664
- I'’m just pretty
shut down right now.

00:14.101 --> 00:16.016
- You know, we decided
to cut things off.

00:19.062 --> 00:20.020
- You knew how much
I liked her.

00:20.063 --> 00:22.196
But you did it anyway!

00:22.239 --> 00:25.547
- ♪ Well, I don'’t
really wanna know...♪

00:26.852 --> 00:28.550
- His stuff'’s gone.

00:28.593 --> 00:30.030
- We screwed up.

00:35.600 --> 00:37.254
- Yeah.

00:37.298 --> 00:38.908
- I'’ll get you some water now.

00:38.951 --> 00:41.084
- What the hell is wrong
with you people?

00:42.520 --> 00:43.695
- That woman just
fainted because

00:43.739 --> 00:45.523
she'’s worked a 12-hour shift!

00:45.567 --> 00:47.395
- Okay, Juliette,
you need to calm down.

00:49.310 --> 00:52.095
The way this place is being
managed is unconscionable!

00:52.139 --> 00:53.792
- Sometimes these things happen.

00:53.836 --> 00:55.794
- No! No, these things
don'’t just happen!

00:55.838 --> 00:57.622
She asked for
a break multiple times

00:57.666 --> 01:00.495
and her supervisor refused
because she'’s on "extra duty".

01:00.538 --> 01:02.497
And you and I both
know what that means.

01:02.540 --> 01:04.803
- I think there'’s been
a miscommunication here.

01:04.847 --> 01:06.979
- No, there'’s been
mismanagement.

01:07.023 --> 01:08.633
severe mismanagement.

01:08.677 --> 01:09.895
Which has become clearer
and clearer to me

01:09.939 --> 01:11.506
over the past few weeks.

01:11.549 --> 01:13.073
- I don'’t know what
you'’re talking about.

01:13.116 --> 01:15.292
We take our volunteers'’
safety very seriously.

01:15.336 --> 01:16.772
Forget it.

01:16.815 --> 01:18.426
I'’ll talk to Darius
when he gets here.

01:18.469 --> 01:20.123
I'’m sure he'll be
very interested in knowing

01:20.167 --> 01:22.691
how his organization is
being handled in his absence.

01:27.696 --> 01:28.871
- Well, I hear you,
but you can'’t just walk out

01:28.914 --> 01:30.916
in the middle of a set!

01:30.960 --> 01:32.092
- Oh, come on.
You think I don'’t know that?

01:33.397 --> 01:35.530
- Hey.

01:35.573 --> 01:37.009
- You guys gonna work
this out?

01:37.053 --> 01:38.576
- I'’m trying to.

01:38.620 --> 01:41.536
Gunnar, can we... can we
at least talk about this?

01:41.579 --> 01:43.886
- Of all the girls in Nashville,
huh, you had to pick her!

01:43.929 --> 01:45.322
- You said it was over.

01:45.366 --> 01:47.368
I mean, you practically
told me to go ahead.

01:47.411 --> 01:48.673
- You know I didn'’t mean that.

01:48.717 --> 01:50.545
- I was trying to be nice, man!

01:50.588 --> 01:51.763
Friends, they don'’t
do that to each other!

01:51.807 --> 01:53.330
- You had broken up!

01:53.374 --> 01:55.985
- Oh my God. It is an
unspoken rule, all right?

01:56.028 --> 01:56.986
Everybody knows that!

01:57.029 --> 01:58.509
For guys?

01:58.553 --> 02:00.381
I thought that was... that
was a girl thing, right?

02:02.122 --> 02:04.385
- I wouldn'’t have done it.

02:04.428 --> 02:05.647
- But I wouldn'’t have
gotten upset

02:05.690 --> 02:06.778
if someone else
had done it either.

02:08.389 --> 02:09.955
- Hey...

02:12.697 --> 02:15.918
I'’ll be outside.

02:15.961 --> 02:17.528
- I can'’t do this.

02:19.182 --> 02:21.793
- Look, man, I didn'’t
mean to hurt you.

02:21.837 --> 02:24.056
I thought you were
okay with it,

02:24.100 --> 02:27.669
and I was wrong, and I'’m...
I'’m really sorry.

02:43.075 --> 02:45.730
- It was actually quite civil.

02:45.774 --> 02:47.732
But there won'’t be
any rehearsal.

02:51.083 --> 02:52.824
- He'’ll get over it.

02:52.868 --> 02:55.697
Not today, clearly,
but he will.

02:55.740 --> 02:57.829
- Maybe I should
just leave the band.

02:57.873 --> 02:59.570
- Don'’t say that.

02:59.614 --> 03:01.529
- I just feel like I'’ve caused
nothing but trouble.

03:01.572 --> 03:02.921
- That'’s crazy.

03:04.793 --> 03:08.666
- Speaking of which,
Brad Maitland approached me

03:08.710 --> 03:11.930
about signing with Shiny New.

03:13.976 --> 03:15.412
- Wow.

03:15.456 --> 03:16.631
- I figured I should tell you.

03:18.241 --> 03:21.636
- Oh, yeah, yeah.
I mean, that'’s, uh...

03:21.679 --> 03:22.941
That'’s great.

03:24.508 --> 03:26.815
- I mean, if that'’s
what you want.

03:26.858 --> 03:28.295
- I don'’t know.

03:28.338 --> 03:30.471
Part of me feels weird
even meeting with him.

03:30.514 --> 03:32.255
Like it'’s disloyalty
to you guys.

03:32.299 --> 03:36.433
- No. You shouldn'’t feel bad.
It'’s an opportunity.

03:36.477 --> 03:38.218
Hey, listen...

03:38.261 --> 03:41.873
no matter what
happens with the band,

03:41.917 --> 03:43.484
it doesn'’t have
to change this.

03:43.527 --> 03:45.050
Come here.

03:51.927 --> 03:53.320
- Hey.
- Hi.

03:53.363 --> 03:54.669
I came right
when I got your text.

03:54.712 --> 03:55.931
What'’s the emergency?

03:55.974 --> 03:57.280
- No emergency.
I just wrote a song,

03:57.324 --> 03:58.586
and I need you to
tell me if it sucks.

03:58.629 --> 04:00.240
That'’s it?
Seriously?

04:00.283 --> 04:01.763
I thought you were like bleeding
to death on the floor.

04:01.806 --> 04:03.808
Or there was a house fire
or something.

04:03.852 --> 04:06.376
- Yeah, '’cause I would
call you in a house fire.

04:06.420 --> 04:08.117
- Hey, I can be very heroic.

04:09.553 --> 04:10.511
Come on, play it already!

04:10.554 --> 04:12.295
- Okay.

Okay, so obviously the verse
needs a little work, but...

04:53.336 --> 04:55.817
- That was awesome!

04:55.860 --> 04:57.775
- Yeah.

04:57.819 --> 04:59.255
You'’re not just
messing with me?

04:59.299 --> 05:01.257
- No. Would I mess
with you? Come on.

05:01.301 --> 05:02.911
- Definitely you would.

05:02.954 --> 05:06.349
- Okay, yeah, I might.
But I'’m not. I swear.

05:06.393 --> 05:07.785
- Thank you.

05:07.829 --> 05:08.873
- You have to send me that.

05:08.917 --> 05:10.658
- Maybe.

05:10.701 --> 05:13.617
- Are you always this
weird about your songs?

05:13.661 --> 05:16.968
- Um, I don'’t know.

05:17.012 --> 05:18.970
I guess I just really want
this to be like perfect.

05:19.014 --> 05:21.364
I wrote it for Jonah and
I just want him to love it.

05:21.408 --> 05:25.368
- Well, he will if
he has any taste at all.

05:25.412 --> 05:27.065
Which is questionable.

05:31.026 --> 05:33.202
- Thank you for coming to me.

05:33.245 --> 05:34.769
We'’re in so many
countries by now,

05:34.812 --> 05:36.684
it'’s really hard to keep
everybody on message.

05:36.727 --> 05:39.251
- Well, the message here
has gotten really screwed up.

05:39.295 --> 05:41.471
- Rest assured, anyone
who threatens the well-being

05:41.515 --> 05:43.560
of this community will
face the consequences.

05:43.604 --> 05:45.388
- I hope so!
- Juliette...

05:45.432 --> 05:47.782
- Darius, you know I believe
in your teachings.

05:47.825 --> 05:49.784
But there is no way
I can stay here now.

05:49.827 --> 05:52.003
- I get it.
I'’m as upset as you are.

05:52.047 --> 05:53.570
But I could not forgive
myself if this made you

05:53.614 --> 05:55.006
give up on your journey.

05:55.050 --> 05:57.618
- It won'’t. I promise.

05:57.661 --> 05:59.228
- Good.

05:59.271 --> 06:00.447
Look, I need your help
if we'’re gonna get to

06:00.490 --> 06:02.144
the bottom of what happened.

06:02.187 --> 06:04.146
Can we sit down tomorrow
and go over the details?

06:04.189 --> 06:06.844
- Of course. I'’m gonna help
make things right.

06:08.977 --> 06:10.326
And then I'’m going home.

06:25.820 --> 06:26.908
- Come in!

06:30.390 --> 06:34.045
- Hello, Juliette. I'’m Bill.
You know Sharon.

06:34.089 --> 06:35.612
We'’re here to go over
some of the claims

06:35.656 --> 06:37.048
you'’ve made with Darius.

06:37.092 --> 06:39.616
Now you said you
witnessed several instances

06:39.660 --> 06:41.139
of what you called "abuse".

06:41.183 --> 06:43.272
- I don'’t call it "abuse".
It was abuse.

06:43.315 --> 06:45.056
Sharon witnessed one
the other day.

06:45.100 --> 06:46.493
The poor girl fainted
because her supervisor

06:46.536 --> 06:48.320
refused to give her a break.

06:48.364 --> 06:50.322
- Yes. We'’ve spoken with the
volunteer in question.

06:50.366 --> 06:53.108
But I'’m afraid she describes
the incident differently.

06:53.151 --> 06:55.371
- What is that
supposed to mean?

06:55.415 --> 06:57.852
- Did you see anyone force
the girl to keep working?

06:57.895 --> 07:00.811
- I saw her ask for a break
twice, which she was denied.

07:02.378 --> 07:05.381
Did she inform the supervisor
that she was ill?

07:05.425 --> 07:08.384
Or did she simply choose
to continue working?

07:08.428 --> 07:10.865
- She wasn'’t given a choice.

07:10.908 --> 07:12.475
- We always have
choices, Juliette.

07:12.519 --> 07:14.303
That'’s what the
Movement teaches.

07:14.346 --> 07:16.697
And right now, we want to
understand why you'’ve chosen

07:16.740 --> 07:18.829
to make such a serious
allegation against it?

07:18.873 --> 07:22.616
- I want to talk to Darius.
- Darius has been called away.

07:22.659 --> 07:24.008
- Oh, my God.

07:24.052 --> 07:25.227
- We'’ll be handling
the issue now.

07:25.270 --> 07:26.750
- I'’m sure you will.

07:26.794 --> 07:28.578
You really think this
is gonna work with me?

07:28.622 --> 07:31.320
Covering up the fact that
people are being brutalized?

07:31.363 --> 07:33.017
- Juliette, we just want
to understand why...

07:33.061 --> 07:35.106
- Don'’t even try starting
with me, okay?

07:35.150 --> 07:37.152
I will come at you so hard,
mark my words.

07:37.195 --> 07:39.110
You will not know
what hit you.

07:39.154 --> 07:43.375
Now if you don'’t mind,
I have a plane to catch.

07:49.817 --> 07:52.123
- You are in no condition
to travel.

07:53.995 --> 07:55.823
- We take threats like
the one that you just made

07:55.866 --> 07:56.824
very seriously.

07:58.303 --> 07:59.870
- Oh, honey,
that wasn'’t a threat.

07:59.914 --> 08:01.959
When I threaten you,
you will know it.

08:02.003 --> 08:03.091
Trust me.

08:07.965 --> 08:10.490
- You are clearly in an
agitated state right now

08:10.533 --> 08:12.448
and we don'’t want
you to endanger yourself

08:12.492 --> 08:15.190
by going anywhere.
Try and stop me.

08:21.283 --> 08:22.893
Are you people serious?

08:22.937 --> 08:24.634
- No one'’s going to hurt you.

08:24.678 --> 08:26.070
We'’re just going to give you
a chance to calm down.

08:26.114 --> 08:29.160
- Get out of my way!
Don'’t touch me!

08:29.204 --> 08:30.684
Get your hands off of me!

08:30.727 --> 08:32.599
You will not lock me
in this room!

08:43.479 --> 08:45.437
- Yo, you gotta get out
right now. Mia'’s coming over.

08:45.481 --> 08:47.048
- Screw you, dude!
I just made food!

08:47.091 --> 08:48.440
- I'’m being serious.

08:48.484 --> 08:50.268
- Can'’t you just go
to your room?

08:50.312 --> 08:52.836
- She needs her privacy, man.
You know this.

08:52.880 --> 08:54.795
- What, your room isn'’t
private enough for her?

08:54.838 --> 08:57.188
I thought you were breaking up
with her anyway.

08:57.232 --> 08:58.450
- I am breaking up with her.

08:58.494 --> 08:59.626
Now will you help me
move this crap?

08:59.669 --> 09:01.541
- Okay, dude.
I'’m just saying.

09:01.584 --> 09:03.368
The more you see her, the more
chance Maddie'’s gonna find out.

09:03.412 --> 09:06.807
- Okay, so then end it.

09:06.850 --> 09:09.810
- The last time that I even
brought up just taking a break,

09:09.853 --> 09:11.289
she completely lost it.

09:11.333 --> 09:12.639
She started talking
about hurting herself.

09:12.682 --> 09:14.815
- Well, maybe you
should tell Maddie.

09:14.858 --> 09:17.208
- No, man.
Her movie'’s coming out soon.

09:17.252 --> 09:19.254
She'’ll get all this attention.

09:19.297 --> 09:20.255
I'’m gonna tell her then.

09:20.298 --> 09:23.040
- Okay, whatever, man.

09:23.084 --> 09:25.434
- Hey, if Maddie
asks anything...

09:25.477 --> 09:28.393
- Yeah, dude, I got your back.
Don'’t worry.

09:39.666 --> 09:41.798
- Thanks.

09:43.147 --> 09:45.367
- I'’m here to stay with you.

09:45.410 --> 09:47.630
- Make sure you'’re not
a danger to yourself.

09:47.674 --> 09:50.981
I'’m the victim!

09:51.025 --> 09:53.331
They locked me in here!

09:53.375 --> 09:56.552
- This happens to any
volunteer who misbehaves.

09:56.596 --> 09:57.945
It'’s for everyone's safety.

10:02.819 --> 10:04.473
Do you have a name?

10:04.516 --> 10:06.562
- Rosa.

10:06.606 --> 10:10.610
- Well, Rosa, the jailer,
I'’m Juliette.

10:10.653 --> 10:12.786
- Everyone here knows
who you are.

10:12.829 --> 10:16.137
- Listen to me, Rosa.
You have to help me...

10:16.180 --> 10:19.531
- Do not come close or
I will call security.

10:25.973 --> 10:27.670
- Let'’s get going!
Come on, Daphne!

10:27.714 --> 10:29.672
We'’re gonna be late!

10:54.610 --> 10:59.702
- And last, but certainly
not least, is Kate.

10:59.746 --> 11:02.052
- Great boots.
- Oh, thanks.

11:02.096 --> 11:04.620
- Anything you want,
and I mean anything,

11:04.664 --> 11:06.317
Kate'’s your point person.
In fact, you know what?

11:06.361 --> 11:07.884
Ask her right now.

11:07.928 --> 11:09.843
Ask her for anything
at all right now. Go ahead.

11:09.886 --> 11:11.540
- Easy, Brad. The girl'’s still
trying to weigh her options.

11:11.583 --> 11:13.847
- No, no, no.
The girl only has one option

11:13.890 --> 11:15.544
and that is to let us
turn you

11:15.587 --> 11:17.633
into what you know you
already are.

11:17.677 --> 11:20.854
Which means getting you into
the studio like yesterday.

11:20.897 --> 11:24.074
- So, how exactly
would this EP work?

11:24.118 --> 11:26.163
I mean, I usually
write my own songs.

11:28.165 --> 11:30.298
You think I'’m gonna force
some jingle writer on you?

11:30.341 --> 11:33.083
Your words, babe.
Your songs, your face.

11:33.127 --> 11:34.519
That'’s what we want.

11:34.563 --> 11:37.653
Let people actually
see you without a bunch

11:37.697 --> 11:39.873
of washed-up fools trying
to hog the spotlight.

11:39.916 --> 11:41.178
- Don'’t start.

11:41.222 --> 11:42.266
- I'’m sorry.
Did I say "fools"?

11:42.310 --> 11:43.703
No, no.

11:43.746 --> 11:45.879
I meant lovely, earnest
young men...

11:45.922 --> 11:48.838
who couldn'’t get
arrested without you.

11:48.882 --> 11:52.189
Listen, hey.
This is your time, girl.

11:52.233 --> 11:55.323
- I really am grateful
for the opportunity.

11:55.366 --> 11:58.456
- Yeah, blah, blah, blah.
Just say yes!

12:04.811 --> 12:06.682
- I'’m just gonna
drop this off for Brad.

12:06.726 --> 12:08.292
Is it okay that
I leave it here?

12:08.336 --> 12:10.686
- Hold on a second, guys.
There she is!

12:10.730 --> 12:13.167
Can'’t have the kid freezing up
there on the mountaintop.

12:13.210 --> 12:15.865
Have to roast him over
a fire like a marshmallow.

12:15.909 --> 12:18.259
- Well, have fun.
- You know we will.

12:23.133 --> 12:24.874
- See, now that'’s what
I'’m talking about right there.

12:24.918 --> 12:26.049
That one.

12:31.272 --> 12:34.144
- Hello, Juliette.
- Please, have a seat.

12:34.188 --> 12:36.886
- I think I'’ll stand.
- If you like.

12:36.930 --> 12:38.496
- Now that you'’ve had some
time to reflect,

12:38.540 --> 12:39.933
do you think we could
have a real conversation?

12:39.976 --> 12:42.239
- Oh, we can have a hell
of a conversation...

12:42.283 --> 12:43.806
with my lawyers

12:43.850 --> 12:46.113
about how you held me
against my will!

12:46.156 --> 12:48.115
- We know you'’re upset.

12:48.158 --> 12:49.725
But I'’m afraid we're
within our rights

12:49.769 --> 12:51.161
to keep you under supervision.

12:51.205 --> 12:53.424
Erratic behavior,
baseless accusations,

12:53.468 --> 12:54.817
physical threats.

12:54.861 --> 12:56.819
- And this isn'’t
the first time, is it?

12:56.863 --> 12:58.952
You'’ve had episodes
like this before.

13:03.086 --> 13:05.523
- You people are sick.

13:05.567 --> 13:08.352
I do not consent
to being kept here!

13:08.396 --> 13:09.919
She'’s a witness!

13:09.963 --> 13:11.225
- Juliette, if you can'’t
control yourself,

13:11.268 --> 13:12.748
we'’ll have to restrain you.

13:12.792 --> 13:14.010
- And we don'’t want
to have to do that.

13:14.054 --> 13:15.795
All we want is to help you.

13:15.838 --> 13:17.144
- Then let me go home.

13:17.187 --> 13:19.799
- We will let you go home
once we find out

13:19.842 --> 13:21.931
why you keep
lashing out like this.

13:21.975 --> 13:24.760
What has made you so angry
that you would allege abuse

13:24.804 --> 13:26.936
against a program that,
in your own words,

13:26.980 --> 13:29.199
has transformed your life?

13:29.243 --> 13:31.114
- Are you ready to
accept help, Juliette?

13:40.471 --> 13:41.516
- Hey.
- Hi.

13:41.559 --> 13:42.778
- You look, uh...

13:42.822 --> 13:44.345
You look ready
for an apocalypse.

13:44.388 --> 13:46.869
- Jonah is taking me on a hike.
So is he still sleeping?

13:46.913 --> 13:50.786
- Uh, I don'’t think
he'’s here right now.

13:52.048 --> 13:53.833
- I mean, I can text him
if you want.

13:53.876 --> 13:56.705
- No, I have been texting him.
And he'’s not replying.

13:58.794 --> 14:00.230
Why does he always do this?

14:00.274 --> 14:02.319
- I mean, you don'’t even
know the half of it.

14:02.363 --> 14:04.408
He'’s pretty much ditched me in
every country we'’ve toured in.

14:12.939 --> 14:15.158
Am I just supposed to like
wait around for him all day?

14:15.202 --> 14:18.945
No. I'’m not.
I'’m not doing that this time.

14:18.988 --> 14:21.034
I'’m going home and
putting on some sweat pants

14:21.077 --> 14:22.644
and I'’m watching "Top Chef",
which I know it sounds

14:22.687 --> 14:24.341
really pathetic
thank you, but...

14:24.385 --> 14:26.561
- Hey, watch it.
That'’s pretty much my day.

14:26.604 --> 14:30.260
Except with pizza and then
pop on a two-hour special

14:30.304 --> 14:32.262
of "Finding Big Foot".

14:40.140 --> 14:41.358
- Oh, for the love of God!

14:41.402 --> 14:43.012
Will you stop
making that noise?

14:43.056 --> 14:45.232
- You'’re easily triggered.

14:45.275 --> 14:46.929
- I'’ve been locked up
for two days.

14:46.973 --> 14:48.452
You'’re damn right
I'’m easily triggered.

14:48.496 --> 14:50.106
- I know you'’re frustrated.

14:50.150 --> 14:52.979
But hostility won'’t solve
any of your problems.

14:53.022 --> 14:54.632
You need to examine the root
of your negative emotions

14:54.676 --> 14:56.069
or they will destroy you.

14:56.112 --> 14:57.592
- That'’s good.

14:57.635 --> 14:59.681
Is that from Chapter 12?
Let'’s see.

14:59.724 --> 15:03.946
I think I remember that passage.
Let me see that.

15:03.990 --> 15:06.340
I want to check something.

15:06.383 --> 15:08.124
Oh! There it is!

15:09.560 --> 15:10.910
- Showing you how
I feel about this crap!

15:10.953 --> 15:12.520
- You cannot do that!

15:12.563 --> 15:14.348
- I'’m unstable!
Haven'’t you been listening?

15:14.391 --> 15:16.393
- You'’re not unstable!
You'’re a troublemaker!

15:17.960 --> 15:19.962
- Thank you.
Thank you.

15:20.006 --> 15:22.486
I knew that Beavis and Butthead
didn'’t think I was crazy.

15:22.530 --> 15:23.574
- I'’m not talking to you!

15:25.446 --> 15:28.405
You'’re right about one thing.

15:28.449 --> 15:30.494
I am a hell of a troublemaker.

15:32.322 --> 15:34.455
Is this how you thought
you'’d spend your life?

15:34.498 --> 15:37.980
Guarding a helpless victim
whose done nothing wrong?

15:38.024 --> 15:40.809
Oh, does the Movement have
a special school for that?

15:40.852 --> 15:44.639
- You know nothing about me.
- Then tell me, please.

15:44.682 --> 15:46.162
I'’d like to know how
somebody loses

15:46.206 --> 15:48.686
all self-respect and dignity!

15:52.864 --> 15:54.779
What?

15:54.823 --> 15:56.042
- You shut up!

16:00.002 --> 16:02.396
- Nothing.
I'’m a loyal volunteer.

16:02.439 --> 16:04.224
- Sure you are.

16:04.267 --> 16:06.443
- Damn you! You will make
things even worse.

16:06.487 --> 16:09.925
Worse than what?

16:19.413 --> 16:21.763
- To your right...
- Okay, shut up!

16:21.806 --> 16:22.851
I'’m trying
to concentrate here.

16:22.894 --> 16:24.592
- Watch it!
- I am watching!

16:24.635 --> 16:26.115
- Then do it.
- It'’s right there.

16:28.770 --> 16:30.554
Okay.
- Woo!

16:30.598 --> 16:34.341
This is why I didn'’t
wanna play this stupid game.

16:34.384 --> 16:36.430
Because you dance
like a wounded giraffe?

16:36.473 --> 16:38.562
- Hey, now...but yes.

16:44.742 --> 16:46.657
- ♪ Love forever♪

16:46.701 --> 16:51.793
♪ Until the world can breathe
in perfect harmony♪

16:51.836 --> 16:54.796
♪ We belong, we

16:54.839 --> 16:57.407
♪ We belong together, we

16:57.451 --> 17:01.977
♪ We belong, we
We belong together ♪

17:04.806 --> 17:07.243
Why would you do that?
You stole my song.

17:07.287 --> 17:10.116
- No, no, no, no.
I'’m so sorry. I didn't...

17:10.159 --> 17:11.682
- I gotcha!

17:11.726 --> 17:12.944
- That was mean.
Screw you.

17:12.988 --> 17:14.381
- Twig, this is so good!

17:14.424 --> 17:15.860
It literally sounds a
bajillion times better.

17:15.904 --> 17:17.210
It sounds professional.

17:17.253 --> 17:18.602
- Oh, come on.
- No, I'’m serious.

17:18.646 --> 17:20.256
You'’re so good at this.

17:23.564 --> 17:26.262
Maddie?

17:26.306 --> 17:28.003
Oh, my God, I'’m so sorry.
Wow.

17:28.047 --> 17:29.222
- Yeah, as you should be.

17:29.265 --> 17:30.614
You missed an
epic dance battle.

17:32.181 --> 17:34.966
- Um...
I got stuck in the studio.

17:35.010 --> 17:36.620
We had to rerecord
this entire track.

17:36.664 --> 17:39.188
- You couldn'’t take three
seconds to text me back?

17:39.232 --> 17:43.845
- All right, look, the truth
is, I completely spaced.

17:43.888 --> 17:45.238
I'’ve been super focused
on this album

17:45.281 --> 17:47.327
and I know that'’s
not an excuse.

17:47.370 --> 17:49.068
I suck.

17:49.111 --> 17:52.332
- Yeah, you do,
and you get no pizza.

17:54.899 --> 17:56.510
- I'’ll make it up
to you, I swear.

17:56.553 --> 17:58.990
- Okay.

17:59.034 --> 18:01.776
You got one piece,
no toppings.

18:01.819 --> 18:03.430
- Okay.

18:06.041 --> 18:08.478
- I'’m telling you, Avery feels
awful about the whole thing.

18:08.522 --> 18:11.742
- Yeah.

18:11.786 --> 18:15.268
- Well, good for him.
He shoulda never started it.

18:15.311 --> 18:18.009
- Look, we both know
it was never gonna work out

18:18.053 --> 18:19.359
between you and Alannah.

18:19.402 --> 18:20.751
- But he knew I wanted it to.

18:20.795 --> 18:22.536
- No, that'’s the point.
He didn'’t!

18:22.579 --> 18:24.973
You kept saying you
weren'’t interested.

18:25.016 --> 18:28.411
Is it possible you
overreacted a little bit?

18:28.455 --> 18:30.152
Gunnar, you'’re gonna
find a new girl.

18:30.196 --> 18:34.461
I'’m guessing you'll be head
over heels by next week.

18:34.504 --> 18:36.898
I'’m telling you, Gunnar feels
awful about the whole thing.

18:36.941 --> 18:39.509
I thought
he wanted to kill me.

18:39.553 --> 18:41.685
- I mean, look at it
from his perspective.

18:41.729 --> 18:44.210
I mean, what if I
slept with Alannah?

18:45.994 --> 18:48.475
- Seriously.
She breaks your heart.

18:48.518 --> 18:49.650
You say you'’re okay.

18:49.693 --> 18:51.173
And then you find out that

18:51.217 --> 18:53.915
she and I are having a
torrid hetero affair.

18:53.958 --> 18:55.525
Wouldn'’t you wanna slug me?

18:55.569 --> 18:57.179
- Probably.

18:58.876 --> 19:01.749
Man, I really
messed this up, didn'’t I?

19:01.792 --> 19:04.143
- It'’s not like you set
out to fall for her.

19:21.638 --> 19:25.294
- No. I need to get
out of here.

19:29.080 --> 19:30.299
- Because I'’m pregnant.

19:32.606 --> 19:34.521
- I read your file.

19:34.564 --> 19:36.740
It did not say
you were pregnant.

19:36.784 --> 19:38.655
- Because it was too early.

19:38.699 --> 19:39.961
Trust me.

19:40.004 --> 19:41.354
The last time I threw up
like this was

19:41.397 --> 19:43.094
when I was carrying
my daughter.

19:45.053 --> 19:47.098
I need to see a doctor.

19:47.142 --> 19:49.927
If I'’m pregnant,
you cannot keep me in here.

19:51.625 --> 19:53.235
- You will keep
quiet about this.

19:53.279 --> 19:54.976
Tell no one.

19:55.019 --> 19:56.630
If I'’m pregnant...

19:56.673 --> 20:00.851
- I said keep quiet and
do nothing until I return.

20:13.995 --> 20:16.563
- Oh, Jessie! Hi.

20:16.606 --> 20:18.173
- I'’m good.
Nice to see you.

20:18.217 --> 20:20.306
- Yeah, you too.

20:20.349 --> 20:21.829
- I hope this isn'’t weird.

20:21.872 --> 20:23.396
Will told me
that you worked here.

20:24.875 --> 20:28.357
- Well, um, I heard that
you were thinking of

20:28.401 --> 20:29.750
signing with Brad Maitland.

20:29.793 --> 20:31.926
- Yeah. I am considering it.

20:31.969 --> 20:34.058
I know you guys
were once married.

20:34.102 --> 20:38.149
- Yes, which is why I feel
like this is so awkward

20:38.193 --> 20:40.021
and I don'’t wanna overstep.

20:40.064 --> 20:42.589
I just felt like I
should warn you about him.

20:42.632 --> 20:46.419
Which sounds so dramatic,
I know.

20:46.462 --> 20:48.203
- No, it'’s okay.

20:48.247 --> 20:50.423
I mean, I'’ve heard
he can be difficult.

20:50.466 --> 20:52.338
I mean, it hasn'’t been
my experience, but...

20:52.381 --> 20:54.862
- It wasn'’t my experience
in the beginning either.

20:54.905 --> 20:57.386
He was incredibly charming
until he wasn'’t.

20:57.430 --> 20:58.866
And then when things went bad,

20:58.909 --> 21:02.739
he just, he made my life
a complete nightmare.

21:02.783 --> 21:04.567
- Oh, I'’m so sorry.

21:04.611 --> 21:06.047
- Oh, no. It'’s okay.

21:06.090 --> 21:07.178
It'’s just that I thought
since we sort of

21:07.222 --> 21:08.876
know each other, I should...

21:08.919 --> 21:10.965
- Just so you know,
I would never get involved

21:11.008 --> 21:11.966
with him in that way.

21:12.009 --> 21:13.489
- Oh, no, no, no.

21:13.533 --> 21:14.751
I wasn'’t implying
that at all actually.

21:14.795 --> 21:17.101
I just thought that
you should know.

21:17.145 --> 21:19.582
- Right.
I kind of figured.

21:19.626 --> 21:23.412
He reminds me of
my dad, actually.

21:23.456 --> 21:25.806
- Narcissist.

21:25.849 --> 21:27.329
- Yes, that'’s exactly right.

21:27.373 --> 21:29.897
- I'’m hoping I know
how to handle that.

21:29.940 --> 21:31.725
- Great.

21:31.768 --> 21:34.554
Well, then, you know, you are
in a better place than I was.

21:37.121 --> 21:39.298
I would just say don'’t
take him lightly.

21:39.341 --> 21:41.996
- Thank you. I won'’t.

21:42.039 --> 21:43.389
- Okay.

21:43.432 --> 21:44.912
Well, I'’ll let you
get back to work.

21:44.955 --> 21:47.044
And if you would,
would you just not mention

21:47.088 --> 21:48.655
that we had this conversation?

21:48.698 --> 21:50.831
I still have to deal
with him in my life.

21:50.874 --> 21:53.399
- Wow. Yeah, no, I won'’t.
Thanks, Jessie.

21:53.442 --> 21:54.748
- Of course.
- Yeah.

21:54.791 --> 21:56.880
- Have a good one.
- You too. See ya.

21:59.883 --> 22:01.929
- Hey.
- Hi.

22:01.972 --> 22:06.281
- I was just in the area.

22:06.325 --> 22:10.633
Um, I wanted to talk to
you about something.

22:12.548 --> 22:14.376
- Um...

22:14.420 --> 22:18.337
So, you know how like you...

22:18.380 --> 22:20.034
Go over stuff in your head?

22:20.077 --> 22:22.732
And you think really hard
about how to say something?

22:22.776 --> 22:27.824
And then, um, when you
actually go to say it,

22:27.868 --> 22:31.262
it'’s like you don't even
know what words are?

22:31.306 --> 22:33.177
Does that make sense at all?
- I guess so.

22:33.221 --> 22:34.614
Do you mind just
saying it, though?

22:34.657 --> 22:35.615
'’Cause you're kind of
freaking me out.

22:35.658 --> 22:37.051
- Yeah.

22:37.094 --> 22:38.444
I just think that you
deserve to be with

22:38.487 --> 22:40.446
someone who
really cares about you.

22:43.927 --> 22:45.407
- I don'’t know. I just...

22:45.451 --> 22:47.061
- You think Jonah
doesn'’t care about me?

22:47.104 --> 22:51.413
- No, no, no, no.
That'’s... no, no, no, no, no.

22:51.457 --> 22:53.284
Um...

22:53.328 --> 22:55.286
That'’s not what I meant.

22:55.330 --> 22:57.245
Sorry. Can I just...

22:58.812 --> 23:00.509
I'’m gonna
start over really quickly.

23:04.252 --> 23:05.775
Oh, hey, Maddie!
How you doing?

23:05.819 --> 23:07.473
I was just in
the neighborhood...

23:07.516 --> 23:09.126
- Twig, no. You can'’t just say
something like that

23:09.170 --> 23:10.214
and then just pretend
that you didn'’t.

23:10.258 --> 23:11.738
- No, sorry.

23:11.781 --> 23:13.914
I didn'’t...that's not
what I meant.

23:13.957 --> 23:18.745
So what I meant
to say is that...

23:22.531 --> 23:24.185
- Twig!

23:24.228 --> 23:26.492
- Sorry.
I'’m sorry.

23:26.535 --> 23:27.493
- I'’m in love with Jonah.

23:27.536 --> 23:31.148
- Yeah.
Yeah, obviously.

23:32.846 --> 23:34.891
Sorry, that was really stupid.
- Wait, Twig.

23:44.814 --> 23:45.859
- Can I get
another Budweiser?

23:45.902 --> 23:47.513
- You bet.

23:49.253 --> 23:51.604
- Just you and your Budweiser.

23:51.647 --> 23:54.128
- You got it.

23:54.171 --> 23:56.913
- Look, maybe I did
overreact a little.

23:56.957 --> 23:59.350
But it'’s just...she
was the first girl

23:59.394 --> 24:01.875
I really liked since Scarlett.
- I get it, man.

24:01.918 --> 24:05.748
It'’s not like I set out
to fall for her.

24:05.792 --> 24:07.358
It just kind of
snuck up on me.

24:08.621 --> 24:10.971
- Well, it is what
it is, I guess.

24:11.014 --> 24:12.581
Not saying this is
gonna be a picnic

24:12.625 --> 24:14.453
seeing you two together
at rehearsals.

24:14.496 --> 24:17.020
But I'’ll deal with it.

24:17.064 --> 24:18.718
- You might not have to.

24:18.761 --> 24:21.547
She'’s, uh, she's thinking
about going solo.

24:21.590 --> 24:24.593
She already got an offer
from Shiny New Records.

24:24.637 --> 24:27.422
- Wow.
That girl doesn'’t miss a beat.

24:27.466 --> 24:30.164
As long as it'’s not
on account of me.

24:30.207 --> 24:31.992
- No. She says it'’s not.

24:32.035 --> 24:33.689
- Well, I guess I gotta
go back to singing

24:33.733 --> 24:34.908
the high girly parts again.

24:38.041 --> 24:41.654
Look, I just want you
to be happy.

24:41.697 --> 24:44.918
If it'’s with Alannah,
then I'’m happy for you.

24:44.961 --> 24:46.354
- Thanks, man.

24:48.008 --> 24:51.185
It'’s pretty complicated
right now.

24:52.839 --> 24:54.405
- Doesn'’t matter
what I tell myself.

24:54.449 --> 24:58.235
It still feels like
I'’m cheating on her.

24:58.279 --> 25:01.064
- She made her choice.

25:01.108 --> 25:03.893
You'’re allowed to move on.

25:03.937 --> 25:07.244
- What scares me is I think I
might really like Alannah and...

25:09.682 --> 25:12.815
I'’m sorry. I... I shouldn't
be telling you this.

25:12.859 --> 25:16.558
It'’s okay, really.

25:19.126 --> 25:20.823
- Yeah.

25:20.867 --> 25:24.697
- ♪ I will never leave you

25:24.740 --> 25:28.527
♪ You should never fear

25:28.570 --> 25:32.269
♪ I am here beside you

25:32.313 --> 25:36.970

25:37.013 --> 25:41.235

26:29.936 --> 26:31.677
Thank you.

26:43.645 --> 26:45.255
I need your help.

26:47.736 --> 26:50.434
- I got you the test.
That'’s all I can do.

26:50.478 --> 26:53.786
- I need to tell my husband
and my daughter.

26:53.829 --> 26:56.876
She'’s gonna be a big sister!
Please!

26:58.878 --> 27:00.662
- I can'’t go against them.

27:00.706 --> 27:03.447
- Rosa, if you help
me get out of here,

27:03.491 --> 27:04.927
I will take you with me.

27:04.971 --> 27:06.712
- I cannot leave!

27:08.104 --> 27:10.019
- You have to stop
talking like this.

27:10.063 --> 27:11.673
They'’ll be here any minute,

27:11.717 --> 27:13.414
and if they hear
destructive speech,

27:13.457 --> 27:16.025
you'’ll be in bigger trouble
than you are already.

27:16.069 --> 27:17.810
- I am begging you.

27:17.853 --> 27:21.727
I cannot have this child here.
I need to be with my family!

27:21.770 --> 27:23.293
Do you have kids?

27:27.602 --> 27:29.560
Then you know.

27:29.604 --> 27:32.868
You would do anything to
protect them, wouldn'’t you?

27:32.912 --> 27:34.435
- Stop it!

27:34.478 --> 27:37.220
- Could you imagine having
your child locked up...

27:37.264 --> 27:38.700
- I don'’t need to imagine!

27:40.528 --> 27:43.618
- Oh, my God.

27:43.662 --> 27:45.054
I'’m so sorry.

27:45.098 --> 27:46.403
Who is it?

27:49.232 --> 27:53.759
- My son, he'’s on lockdown.
Like you.

27:53.802 --> 27:55.108
I'’m not allowed to see him.

27:57.023 --> 27:58.764
- Let me help you.

27:58.807 --> 28:00.591
- You have to stop this.

28:00.635 --> 28:03.029
They'’ll find out
and hurt us both.

28:03.072 --> 28:05.031
There'’s no way to
win against them.

28:05.074 --> 28:07.773
The only thing that you can
do in this place is submit.

28:07.816 --> 28:09.731
Trust me.

28:09.775 --> 28:12.168
- I will never submit.

28:12.212 --> 28:15.128
- Then I don'’t know what
will happen to you.

28:27.967 --> 28:29.403
- Submit.

28:40.588 --> 28:42.764
- Angry...

28:42.808 --> 28:44.592
But I'’ve been thinking about

28:44.635 --> 28:47.116
everything that
was said yesterday.

28:47.160 --> 28:49.336
And trying to see
my part in it.

28:54.950 --> 28:57.561
- I try to be a good person.

28:57.605 --> 29:01.174
I do what I feel is best,

29:01.217 --> 29:05.178
even stick up for people even
when they don'’t ask me to.

29:05.221 --> 29:07.746
- Like when you spoke up for
that volunteer who fainted?

29:09.312 --> 29:12.968
- She was hurt
and I reacted.

29:13.012 --> 29:15.014
- You know what it'’s like
to hurt, don'’t you?

29:17.625 --> 29:19.366
- Yes, I do.

29:19.409 --> 29:23.152
- Who helped you when you were
a little girl being abused?

29:25.764 --> 29:27.940
- No one.

29:31.204 --> 29:32.901
- Yes.

29:32.945 --> 29:35.599
- What happens to you when
that feeling'’s triggered?

29:38.428 --> 29:39.734
- I lash out.

29:41.301 --> 29:44.652
- Whoever is there,

29:44.695 --> 29:46.132
even if they
don'’t deserve it.

29:48.221 --> 29:49.744
- Why are you crying,
Juliette?

29:51.877 --> 29:54.053
- Because I'’m afraid
it'’ll never go away.

29:57.491 --> 30:00.059
- We all have demons,
Juliette.

30:00.102 --> 30:02.713
What matters is that
you'’re willing to face them.

30:05.542 --> 30:06.979
- You'’re doing well today.

30:09.677 --> 30:10.896
- I'’m trying.

30:22.124 --> 30:24.431
- So here'’s to our
newest artist

30:24.474 --> 30:26.955
and the fantastic career
that lies before her.

30:26.999 --> 30:28.957
Welcome to Shiny New.

30:29.001 --> 30:30.698
- To Alannah!

30:38.924 --> 30:41.665
- I signed!
Pop the champagne!

30:41.709 --> 30:43.798
- Sounds like you
already have.

30:43.842 --> 30:45.278
Congratulations.

30:45.321 --> 30:46.627
- Thanks.

30:50.283 --> 30:51.501
- I don'’t think, it's just...

30:51.545 --> 30:52.894
I mean, it should
be like

30:52.938 --> 30:55.331
the most amazing night
of my life, right?

30:55.375 --> 30:58.117
Everyone'’s telling me
how great I am.

30:58.160 --> 30:59.466
And how excited they
are to work with me.

30:59.509 --> 31:01.381
And I just don'’t know why.

31:01.424 --> 31:04.123
- Well, maybe it'’s because
you'’re an incredible artist.

31:04.166 --> 31:07.126
I am an artist?

31:07.169 --> 31:09.693
- I see so much more than that.

31:09.737 --> 31:11.913
- Don'’t say that.

31:11.957 --> 31:13.828
If you saw it all,
you'’d never wanna be with me.

31:13.872 --> 31:15.569
- Alannah...

31:15.612 --> 31:17.484
- There'’s something
wrong with me!

31:17.527 --> 31:21.792
It'’s like every time I get close
to something good, I ruin it.

31:21.836 --> 31:23.490
Like playing with you guys.

31:23.533 --> 31:24.795
I mean, I loved it.

31:24.839 --> 31:26.014
And it was simple.

31:26.058 --> 31:29.409
And then I screwed it up.

31:29.452 --> 31:32.412
And now I'’m with this
douchebag label head.

31:32.455 --> 31:34.936
And if he is horrible to work
with, well, I'’ll deserve it.

31:34.980 --> 31:37.373
- Alannah, stop.
Look, where are you?

31:37.417 --> 31:39.636
Let me come get you.
- No, don'’t.

31:39.680 --> 31:42.857
God, I swore to myself I would
never let this happen again.

31:42.901 --> 31:45.077
And then you came along, and...

31:45.120 --> 31:47.775
Why'’d you have to be so...

31:50.212 --> 31:51.866
- Forget it.

31:51.910 --> 31:53.781
I already made enough of
a fool out of myself.

32:02.007 --> 32:04.966
They'’re so cheesy.

32:05.010 --> 32:07.360
- Yo, change the channel.

32:07.403 --> 32:08.883
- I think it'’s kind of cute.

32:08.927 --> 32:10.885
- She'’s cute.
The song sucks.

32:10.929 --> 32:13.409
- For real, though.
That song you just wrote?

32:13.453 --> 32:15.107
Infinitely better.

32:15.150 --> 32:17.413
Like what you showed me?
Just you and the guitar?

32:17.457 --> 32:19.154
You could almost put
that out right now.

32:19.198 --> 32:21.330
- No. I mean, it definitely
needs more like instrumentation.

32:21.374 --> 32:23.202
Mixing and everything.

32:23.245 --> 32:24.246
- Well, what are you
thinking for it?

32:24.290 --> 32:25.552
What do you have in mind?

32:25.595 --> 32:26.988
Because my guy, Neil,
who produced

32:27.032 --> 32:28.642
"Different Kind", amazing.

32:28.685 --> 32:32.341
I mean, I know you have
your people, but he...

32:32.385 --> 32:34.039
- Yeah, maybe.

32:34.082 --> 32:35.475
- Twig, don'’t you think
that Neil would do

32:35.518 --> 32:38.913
an amazing job with her sound?

32:38.957 --> 32:40.306
- I don'’t know, dude.
Whatever.

32:43.048 --> 32:45.267
- Someone'’s panties
are in a bunch.

32:45.311 --> 32:49.271
- Hey, being a perpetual virgin
would make anyone tense.

32:49.315 --> 32:50.838
Just have to find him a girl.

32:50.881 --> 32:52.796
- Good luck.

33:01.544 --> 33:03.024
- I really don'’t want things
to be weird now.

33:03.068 --> 33:04.808
- No, I know, I know, I know.
I'’m sorry.

33:04.852 --> 33:09.378
I made it weird,
so just ignore me.

33:09.422 --> 33:11.815
- No, I don'’t wanna ignore you.
You'’re my friend.

33:12.860 --> 33:13.817
- Okay.

33:15.384 --> 33:17.038
- No, I just think
it'’s funny how girls

33:17.082 --> 33:19.171
always think that
that'’s possible.

33:19.214 --> 33:21.825
- Um, okay, so this entire time,

33:21.869 --> 33:23.653
you'’ve just been acting like
we have an actual friendship

33:23.697 --> 33:24.741
when really
that'’s what you wanted?

33:24.785 --> 33:26.830
- No, no, no.
- Awesome.

33:26.874 --> 33:29.224
- No, hey, Maddie. Wait.
Please, please, please?

33:29.268 --> 33:31.705
I wasn'’t acting, okay?

33:31.748 --> 33:33.098
I really do wanna
be your friend.

33:39.582 --> 33:41.976
- I will try
to restrain myself.

33:42.020 --> 33:44.718
But I am only human.

33:49.679 --> 33:51.290
- Hey.

33:51.333 --> 33:53.422
- I just wanted to make
sure you'’re okay.

33:53.466 --> 33:55.076
- I'’m fine!

33:55.120 --> 33:56.817
- Hold on a second...

33:56.860 --> 33:58.732
- Please, just forget it.
I never should have called you.

33:58.775 --> 34:00.299
And you definitely
should not have come here!

34:01.952 --> 34:04.085
- '’Cause how can you
even look at me after

34:04.129 --> 34:05.217
I freaked out on you like that?

34:05.260 --> 34:06.870
- Hey, trust me.

34:06.914 --> 34:08.785
That was not even on the
Richter Scale of a freak-out.

34:08.829 --> 34:10.265
- Spewed my feelings
all over you

34:10.309 --> 34:11.962
like the girl
in "The Exorcist".

34:12.006 --> 34:14.748
- Well, good. I wanna know
what you'’re feeling.

34:14.791 --> 34:18.360
I can'’t figure out why
you'’re so hard on yourself

34:18.404 --> 34:20.884
when you'’re obviously
so wonderful.

34:20.928 --> 34:21.972
- Stop it!

34:23.887 --> 34:25.106
- Hey, did it ever occur
to you that

34:25.150 --> 34:26.934
I might be afraid of
scaring you off?

34:26.977 --> 34:29.676
I mean, in case you
haven'’t noticed,

34:29.719 --> 34:32.070
I'’m kind of a
mess right now.

34:34.202 --> 34:35.725
- I noticed a little.

34:41.862 --> 34:44.082
Maybe we can be
messes together.

34:55.658 --> 34:56.964
- This is not gonna work.

34:57.007 --> 34:58.618
- It will work.

34:58.661 --> 35:00.272
It'’ll only take me
two minutes to get my passport.

35:00.315 --> 35:02.926
- You don'’t understand.
I can'’t lie.

35:02.970 --> 35:04.624
I don'’t know how to do it.

35:04.667 --> 35:06.930
- Trust me, honey.
I'’m an expert, right?

35:06.974 --> 35:11.370
Practice with me again.
I'’m him.

35:14.329 --> 35:18.942
Can I...I mean,
I can, um...

35:18.986 --> 35:21.423
I mean, I have...

35:21.467 --> 35:25.819
- Listen, the key is you are
asking for help, okay?

35:25.862 --> 35:28.169
Men love to be asked for help.

35:28.213 --> 35:30.954
"I am so sorry.
Maria really needs me.

35:30.998 --> 35:32.391
Can you help me out?"

35:34.784 --> 35:36.525
- Oh, honey, he'’s gonna
offer you the key.

35:38.223 --> 35:40.964
- Man, you really haven'’t
been out much, have you?

35:41.008 --> 35:43.358
He will give you the key.

35:45.230 --> 35:47.188
- I can'’t do this.

35:47.232 --> 35:48.755
I... I'’m shaking.

35:48.798 --> 35:51.801
- Rosa, listen to me.
Breathe, okay?

35:51.845 --> 35:53.760
You can do this.

35:53.803 --> 35:56.197
When we get outta here, we'’re
gonna go get your little boy.

35:56.241 --> 35:57.981
Then you will both be free.

35:58.025 --> 35:59.287
Don'’t you want that?

36:01.420 --> 36:03.422
Okay, good girl.
I'’m gonna go get in position.

36:03.465 --> 36:06.207
And then you'’re gonna
call him, okay?

36:06.251 --> 36:07.904
- Okay.

36:07.948 --> 36:09.297
- You can do this!

36:11.038 --> 36:12.779
- Okay.

36:27.794 --> 36:30.492
George, you there?

36:31.885 --> 36:33.843
- Can you please come
to where I am?

36:40.502 --> 36:41.764
- No.

36:41.808 --> 36:44.463
I just need to ask
you a favor.

36:44.506 --> 36:46.552
- You never asked me
a favor before.

36:46.595 --> 36:51.121
- Because I never needed
your help before.

36:52.949 --> 36:56.214
- Maria has cramps, so I want
to bring her some medicine.

36:56.257 --> 36:57.650
- I'’ll take it to her.

36:57.693 --> 37:01.001
- No, no.
She doesn'’t want anyone to know.

37:01.044 --> 37:02.785
- So you want me
to watch this one?

37:02.829 --> 37:05.527
She'’s finally asleep.

37:08.835 --> 37:11.707
- Go ahead, but hurry up.

37:11.751 --> 37:15.233
- Thank you.

37:15.276 --> 37:18.758
- She'’s in a different building.
How will you get in there?

37:19.846 --> 37:21.326
- I don'’t know.

37:27.636 --> 37:28.985
- Don'’t get me in trouble.

37:31.249 --> 37:32.337
- I won'’t.

37:42.347 --> 37:43.522
- You'’re a pro.

37:43.565 --> 37:45.132
- I'’m going to be sick.

37:45.175 --> 37:47.830
- That'’s my job.

37:47.874 --> 37:50.137
If anybody comes, you'’re on
your way to see Maria.

37:50.180 --> 37:51.312
- I know, I know. Hurry!

37:51.356 --> 37:52.879
- Okay.

37:58.537 --> 37:59.451
Rosa?

38:01.670 --> 38:03.542
It'’s locked!

38:03.585 --> 38:06.109
- George wouldn'’t have that key.

38:06.153 --> 38:07.589
- Keep watching the hallway.

38:25.912 --> 38:26.869
Who'’s there?

38:29.307 --> 38:31.178
What are you doing?

38:31.221 --> 38:33.920
- I'’m on a break.
What are you doing?

38:35.356 --> 38:37.663
- I don'’t know.
It came from outside.

38:38.925 --> 38:40.883
- Yeah, out that door.

38:40.927 --> 38:41.928
I think I heard some
yelling too.

38:41.971 --> 38:44.104
- Yes.

38:44.147 --> 38:45.105
- Let me know
if you see anybody.

38:45.148 --> 38:46.106
- Okay.

38:52.939 --> 38:53.853
- Nice job.

38:56.421 --> 38:57.770
Let'’s go!

39:03.645 --> 39:06.213
- She'’s not in there.

39:06.256 --> 39:09.912
- What do you mean,
she'’s not in there?

39:12.741 --> 39:13.699
- Got ya!

39:13.742 --> 39:14.961
- I'’m gonna kill you!

39:17.093 --> 39:18.791
- You'’re all right.

39:18.834 --> 39:22.011
I always thought you
were the serious kind.

39:22.055 --> 39:24.144
- I am the serious kind.

39:24.187 --> 39:25.580
- Not as serious as you think.

39:27.843 --> 39:29.105
- I should check on her.

39:32.282 --> 39:34.415
- We should go out sometime.

39:34.459 --> 39:36.939
- Not if you don'’t
let me do my work.

39:36.983 --> 39:39.159
- All right, all right.

39:41.074 --> 39:42.815
But I'’m gonna have
my eye on you now.

39:42.858 --> 39:45.383
- As long as that'’s all
you have on me.

39:46.906 --> 39:48.864
- Not as serious as you think.

40:04.706 --> 40:07.100
- You go, girl!

40:07.143 --> 40:08.710
I like your new boyfriend.

40:08.754 --> 40:10.103
- Oh, please.

40:10.146 --> 40:14.455
- Come on.
We have to go get your son.

40:14.499 --> 40:15.761
- I can'’t go.

40:15.804 --> 40:17.632
- You have to.

40:17.676 --> 40:20.896
- No, it'’s too dangerous.
I can'’t do that to my son.

40:20.940 --> 40:22.420
- We can do this.

40:22.463 --> 40:23.986
Look at what
we'’ve accomplished already.

40:26.032 --> 40:27.642
They'’re gonna know
you helped me.

40:27.686 --> 40:30.297
- No. Once you step outside,
I'’ll wait one minute

40:30.340 --> 40:32.125
and then start screaming.

40:32.168 --> 40:34.432
I'’ll tell them George was
supposed to be watching you.

40:34.475 --> 40:35.868
And he'’ll take the blame.

40:37.739 --> 40:40.481
- I'’ll come back for you.

40:40.525 --> 40:42.091
- No, you won'’t.

40:42.135 --> 40:44.442
- You don'’t know me.

40:47.619 --> 40:48.620
Thank you.

40:50.535 --> 40:52.058
You saved my life.

40:53.929 --> 40:54.974
- Go!

41:11.643 --> 41:13.775
- Help! She'’s gone!

41:35.275 --> 41:40.628
- Por favor! Por favor!

41:45.111 --> 41:46.373
- Si.

41:46.416 --> 41:48.941
- No problem.
- Gracias.
