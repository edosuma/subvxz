00:36.871 --> 00:40.333
This is Helo 1.
I have visual confirmation on Hodaddy.

00:40.583 --> 00:44.295
Still negative on our bad boy.
Repeat. Still negative on the pickup.

00:44.629 --> 00:47.590
Heading for rendezvous at LZ Alpha Echo.

01:04.607 --> 01:07.819
All right, where are you, Percy?
Come on. Come on.

01:08.153 --> 01:10.947
Wait a second. There's our turncoat.

01:17.537 --> 01:18.621
Whoops.

01:43.438 --> 01:45.732
For crying out loud.

01:50.653 --> 01:51.863
Special Agent Scott.

01:52.197 --> 01:54.449
Mac here. Tell me you found that pilot.

01:54.699 --> 01:56.034
Absolutely. He's right here.

01:58.369 --> 01:59.454
- Here you go.
- Is he alive?

02:03.791 --> 02:04.792
Yeah, he's okay.

02:04.876 --> 02:07.503
Don't screw this up, Alex.
I want this guy in one piece.

02:07.795 --> 02:09.631
Consider it done.

02:21.601 --> 02:24.479
- You okay?
- No, my leg's broken!

02:25.480 --> 02:27.607
You got ice on it right away.
That should help.

02:27.982 --> 02:30.151
Let's get out of here
before the Russians get here.

02:30.235 --> 02:31.569
Hey, let me ask you something.

02:33.154 --> 02:34.614
What'd you do with that
plane that you stole?

02:39.494 --> 02:40.536
Here they come.

02:41.621 --> 02:43.414
I'm not talking till
you get me out of here.

02:43.706 --> 02:44.749
- Is that right?
- Yeah.

02:44.958 --> 02:46.000
All right, let's go.

02:47.460 --> 02:49.128
God! Okay! Gundars!

02:50.004 --> 02:52.757
I sold the plane to
Arnold Gundars. Now get me out of here!

02:55.093 --> 02:56.261
Get up.

03:29.669 --> 03:31.421
- They're coming!
- I got it.

03:34.173 --> 03:35.258
No, I don't.

03:48.438 --> 03:49.522
Fire!

03:53.818 --> 03:55.069
You okay?

04:11.753 --> 04:16.341
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,

04:16.882 --> 04:20.720

04:26.893 --> 04:31.689

04:32.732 --> 04:33.941
When I say break, break clean.

04:34.025 --> 04:35.943
Watch those punches,
keep those punches up high.

04:36.027 --> 04:37.528
Remember, I'm fair, but I'm firm.

04:37.612 --> 04:40.281
Cheer up, boy. You getting ready to have
your first <i>Sports Illustrated</i> cover.

04:40.365 --> 04:42.241
Even though you're gonna
be on it like this...

04:42.700 --> 04:43.743
We'll see who looks like that.

04:43.826 --> 04:44.994
Come on, touch them up.

04:45.078 --> 04:47.914
Yeah, shit. He's scary as hell, ain't he?

04:48.081 --> 04:49.707
Ow, ow!

04:51.793 --> 04:56.089
<i>Kelly Robinson has come up with an
exotic new challenge for himself.</i>

04:56.255 --> 04:58.007
If he defends his title tonight,

04:58.549 --> 05:03.471
<i>he'll do it again Thursday
in Budapest, Hungary.</i>

05:07.392 --> 05:09.435
When you start doing this,
I know what that means.

05:09.644 --> 05:12.063
I know what this mean.
I know what this mean when you do that.

05:12.271 --> 05:14.190
<i>And Lirette is on queer street.</i>

05:14.315 --> 05:15.900
You know what's gonna happen now, right?

05:20.696 --> 05:22.281
Boy, fight now! What you doing?

05:22.365 --> 05:24.575
<i>Kelly's getting frustrated
because Lirette won't fight.</i>

05:25.243 --> 05:28.329
I'm gonna give you a free shot 'cause I
ain't gonna chase you all around the ring.

05:28.538 --> 05:29.831
Take a shot at this here.

05:31.582 --> 05:33.167
Don't be scared. I'll close my eyes.

05:33.459 --> 05:34.544
How about this?

05:47.932 --> 05:50.101
Three! Four!

05:50.351 --> 05:52.145
Five! Six!

05:52.645 --> 05:55.565
Seven! Eight! Nine!

05:55.982 --> 05:57.650
Ten! You're out!

05:57.942 --> 06:00.611
<i>Warm up the goulash in Budapest.</i>

06:00.778 --> 06:02.905
Kelly Robinson is coming.

06:03.114 --> 06:06.784
I told you. Hold on. Come on,
get this shot for <i>Sports Illustrated.</i>

06:07.451 --> 06:08.452
Cheese.

06:17.837 --> 06:19.088
Yeah.

06:20.882 --> 06:23.885
Yeah, 57 and 0.
Gonna be 58 and 0 in a couple of days.

06:23.968 --> 06:26.137
Might as well put infinity on there
because I'll never lose.

06:26.220 --> 06:27.972
I know what you saying.

06:28.055 --> 06:30.224
You better retire.
You gonna run out of space on that arm.

06:31.100 --> 06:33.227
Jerry, you ain't got to do that.

06:33.311 --> 06:34.562
You been my boy for 10 years.

06:34.645 --> 06:36.856
Don't blow smoke up my ass.
Get your head out my ass.

06:36.939 --> 06:38.482
- Head's out the ass.
- Relax, man.

06:38.566 --> 06:40.568
Yeah, seriously, Jerry. That's pathetic.

06:40.943 --> 06:42.069
You've only worked three years.

06:42.153 --> 06:43.988
Keep your head where it's at.

06:44.488 --> 06:46.240
- Now, about the drawers.
- Yeah.

06:46.324 --> 06:49.118
I think I got some drawers
your size made of licorice.

06:49.994 --> 06:52.705
Hello, sir. Yes, right. Hold on, sir.

06:52.872 --> 06:53.998
Kelly.

06:54.165 --> 06:55.791
- Kelly!
- Yeah? What's going on?

06:56.167 --> 06:57.251
It's the President.

06:57.335 --> 06:59.170
Really? President of the United States.

06:59.670 --> 07:01.923
The President want to
talk to Kelly Robinson.

07:02.548 --> 07:04.091
- Mr. President?
<i>- What's up, homey?</i>

07:04.175 --> 07:05.760
- What's happening, baby?
<i>- What's going on, dog?</i>

07:05.843 --> 07:08.346
- It's all good. How you doing?
<i>- Fine. Just kicking with Putin.</i>

07:08.429 --> 07:11.057
G.W.B., you were supposed to call me
when the cameras was on.

07:11.140 --> 07:13.559
<i>- My bad. I got a mucho hush-hush.</i>
- All right.

07:13.643 --> 07:17.271
<i>Hear you're going to Budapest.
We got us a</i> muy <i>secret-o situation.</i>

07:17.355 --> 07:19.690
- Really?
<i>- America needs your help.</i>

07:20.107 --> 07:22.318
- No problem at all.
<i>- We need a little civilian cover.</i>

07:22.401 --> 07:24.111
- You got it, baby.
<i>- Owe you one.</i>

07:24.195 --> 07:27.156
- All right, I'll talk to you real soon.
<i>- I will not forget...</i>

07:27.365 --> 07:29.158
President want me to do him a favor.

07:29.575 --> 07:31.244
He said something about America needs me.

07:31.702 --> 07:34.789
- What kind of favor?
- Some kind of top-secret mission.

07:35.039 --> 07:36.958
Oh, you mean like 007?

07:37.208 --> 07:39.794
Yeah, except only I'm
gonna be 009 and a half.

07:39.877 --> 07:44.465
Know what I'm saying? 007.
You know what 009 and a half means?

07:44.632 --> 07:46.133
- I think so.
- It's a little innuendo.

07:49.553 --> 07:53.808
- So you're going to Budapest?
- Yes, I am. Kind of exciting.

07:54.016 --> 07:56.936
- I'm a little nervous.
- I'm sure you'll do fine.

07:57.019 --> 07:58.479
No, I know I will.

07:59.689 --> 08:01.065
That's got a kick to it.

08:01.148 --> 08:05.194
It's just, this is the first chance I've had
to work with Special Agent Rachel Wright.

08:05.278 --> 08:07.697
Rachel. You're still hung up on her?

08:07.780 --> 08:09.532
Edna, I'm not hung up on her.

08:09.615 --> 08:11.993
I find her interesting,
and I admire her work.

08:12.076 --> 08:13.828
Yeah, there's a certain
allure that she has.

08:13.911 --> 08:15.788
You know, a blind man could see that.

08:15.871 --> 08:17.415
Well, why don't you tell her?

08:17.498 --> 08:21.961
I will tell her. It's just, I get nervous,
and I end up sounding like an idiot...

08:24.922 --> 08:27.049
Want me to tell you how
to melt Rachel's heart?

08:27.133 --> 08:29.176
- Yeah.
- Talk to Carlos.

08:29.552 --> 08:31.345
What does that mean? They had a thing?

08:31.429 --> 08:33.431
Two-week stakeout. She could barely walk.

08:33.597 --> 08:35.349
Rachel and Carlos?

08:35.765 --> 08:37.601
You called, Edna?

08:38.144 --> 08:39.854
You are a vision, as always.

08:41.605 --> 08:42.857
Hello, Alex.

08:43.774 --> 08:45.943
Hello, Carlos. How was Cuba?

08:46.902 --> 08:47.945
Adequate.

08:48.029 --> 08:49.864
Oh, adequate, my eye.

08:49.947 --> 08:51.866
He single-handedly averted
another Bay of Pigs.

08:51.949 --> 08:53.367
- No, I didn't...
- Yes.

08:53.451 --> 08:55.202
- You exaggerate.
- Oh, well, I...

08:55.286 --> 08:58.205
- You do exaggerate sometimes.
- Okay, at times, yeah.

08:58.289 --> 08:59.415
And you, Alex?

09:00.249 --> 09:02.460
How did you fare in the tundra?

09:03.461 --> 09:05.087
You know, I did pretty good.

09:05.171 --> 09:09.008
I got selected for a new mission, so
obviously everybody was satisfied.

09:09.508 --> 09:10.676
And the pilot?

09:11.302 --> 09:13.137
The pilot...

09:14.472 --> 09:17.558
Was able to talk to him,
get some valuable information from him.

09:18.976 --> 09:20.019
Successful mission.

09:20.853 --> 09:24.648
Alex, you didn't go and get him killed,
now, did you?

09:24.732 --> 09:27.943
No, no, no. I mean...

09:28.319 --> 09:30.780
You know, sort of. I mean...
Yeah, he's dead.

09:30.863 --> 09:32.114
He's dead.

09:35.493 --> 09:36.827
What are you gonna do?

09:38.120 --> 09:40.623
- Let me tell you something, all right, Alex.
- Yeah.

09:40.706 --> 09:44.085
You're an excellent agent.
Don't let results like this fool you.

09:44.960 --> 09:46.003
All right?

09:52.885 --> 09:55.471
My car. Be back for my things later.

09:55.930 --> 09:57.848
See you, Carlos. <i>La vida loca!</i>

10:00.684 --> 10:01.852
What a phony.

10:03.771 --> 10:07.191
I'd give anything to go on
a two-week stakeout with that man.

10:07.441 --> 10:10.361
What did you hear happened
on the stakeout between him and Rachel?

10:10.444 --> 10:14.031
- I didn't hear anything.
- No, it's not what I heard, it's what I saw.

10:14.698 --> 10:16.659
It's what I saw.
I saw the look on her face.

10:18.411 --> 10:20.246
Every woman recognizes that look.

10:20.329 --> 10:22.415
- What's that look?
- Look of total satisfaction.

10:30.840 --> 10:32.591
Guy gets a couple missions in Latin America,

10:32.675 --> 10:35.094
all of a sudden he's a Julio Iglesias.

10:35.261 --> 10:36.720
You know, he's from Iowa, by the way.

10:37.847 --> 10:39.390
- Is this my stuff?
- Oh, easy.

10:40.015 --> 10:42.518
This is Carlos' stuff. This is yours.

10:49.483 --> 10:51.443
Where's my monofilament phone descender?

10:52.570 --> 10:55.865
I didn't get one of these exploding pagers.
I don't see one of those.

10:56.782 --> 10:58.159
You got the micro GPS.

10:58.242 --> 10:59.243
Micro?

11:00.578 --> 11:01.579
This is your spy-cam.

11:06.041 --> 11:08.794
This is Carlos' spy-cam,
and this is my spy-cam?

11:10.004 --> 11:11.505
Look at the size of this thing!

11:11.881 --> 11:14.466
Size matters.
But in the spy world, it's reversed.

11:14.550 --> 11:18.345
You want people to say,
"Look how small and sexy and sleek this is."

11:18.512 --> 11:21.765
Not, "How huge this is! Look what he pulled
out of his pants. It's huge!"

11:22.641 --> 11:24.685
People will laugh at me if I pull this out.

11:24.768 --> 11:26.937
Is that his escape module?

11:27.104 --> 11:30.149
Yes, it is. I know,
everybody wants to be like Carlos.

11:30.399 --> 11:33.194
I don't want to be like Carlos,
but I can't help noticing

11:33.277 --> 11:37.198
that my stuff looks like
you can get it from Radio Shack in 1972.

11:37.281 --> 11:38.324
Uh-huh.

11:40.451 --> 11:41.452
Yes, it is.

11:44.747 --> 11:45.956
Right away.

11:46.415 --> 11:48.751
- All right, we'll finish this later.
- It's a good start, though.

11:53.214 --> 11:57.259
<i>Kelly Robinson, seen here making
his typical flamboyant entrance...</i>

11:57.343 --> 11:59.845
Shouldn't this be on
the Weather Channel or something?

11:59.929 --> 12:03.182
<i>With a first-round knockout
of Blake "The Blade" Lirette.</i>

12:03.265 --> 12:08.604
<i>Yeah!
57 and 0, baby! Kelly Robinson, baby!</i>

12:08.687 --> 12:10.689
That guy is so annoying.

12:10.814 --> 12:12.900
<i>Everybody "Hungary"
for his showdown</i>

12:12.983 --> 12:15.611
<i>with the European heavyweight king,
Cedric Mills.</i>

12:15.694 --> 12:18.197
<i>I don't think you understand
how important it is to Kelly Robinson</i>

12:18.280 --> 12:21.075
<i>that he be 58 and 0.
I'm 57 and 0 right now.</i>

12:21.158 --> 12:22.576
<i>This man gonna be 58!</i>

12:22.660 --> 12:24.828
- That guy is a born jerk.
<i>- Cheese. Cheese.</i>

12:24.912 --> 12:27.581
<i>That's right, take my picture.
Cheese. Cheese.</i>

12:27.665 --> 12:29.875
<i>Get my right side. Cheese.</i>

12:31.168 --> 12:32.461
Alex!

12:33.170 --> 12:35.589
General Tucker, this is
Special Agent Alex Scott.

12:35.673 --> 12:37.591
- General.
- Special agent.

12:37.675 --> 12:40.844
I still love hearing that. I was just
a regular agent till a couple weeks ago,

12:40.928 --> 12:43.973
and then around Christmas,
I got promoted to special.

12:44.723 --> 12:45.849
Special.

12:46.892 --> 12:48.602
We were going over the op.

12:48.686 --> 12:50.187
We call it the "Switchblade."

12:50.271 --> 12:54.483
They designed the thing as the first
electrochromatic invisible stealth aircraft.

12:54.566 --> 12:56.443
But in the hands of the evildoers,

12:56.527 --> 12:59.989
it's an untraceable delivery system
for weapons of mass destruction.

13:00.155 --> 13:01.949
New owner? Arnold Gundars.

13:02.032 --> 13:05.160
The boys over at CIA
have access to his overseas accounts.

13:05.744 --> 13:08.998
The past five days,
there's been a significant depletion of funds

13:09.081 --> 13:10.416
without any reimbursements.

13:10.582 --> 13:12.876
In other words,
the bastard's bought the damn plane.

13:12.960 --> 13:14.253
He just hasn't sold it yet.

13:14.336 --> 13:15.713
I'll get it back, General.

13:19.675 --> 13:20.884
Give me a minute.

13:22.594 --> 13:23.595
Hot.

13:26.557 --> 13:28.309
Are you sure we can't use Carlos?

13:28.392 --> 13:29.893
No, they all know him.

13:29.977 --> 13:33.147
Without plastic surgery,
he wouldn't last five minutes on this case.

13:33.772 --> 13:35.024
That's a shame.

13:35.566 --> 13:37.151
That Carlos is amazing.

13:38.110 --> 13:39.403
This guy...

13:41.488 --> 13:43.365
You sure about this, Mac?

13:43.449 --> 13:44.825
He'll get the job done.

13:48.996 --> 13:50.372
Shouldn't Rachel be here?

13:50.456 --> 13:52.333
She's already in Budapest,
setting up the op site.

13:52.416 --> 13:54.293
You've worked with her before, right?

13:54.752 --> 13:57.129
I have, but not in a stakeout situation.

13:57.212 --> 13:59.048
This mission doesn't call for a stakeout.

13:59.131 --> 14:01.633
It wouldn't kill us to keep
our options open, I guess.

14:02.468 --> 14:04.345
The European middleweight championship

14:04.428 --> 14:06.680
is being held in Budapest in two days.

14:06.764 --> 14:10.267
Gundars is a boxing fanatic.
He's throwing a party the night before.

14:10.351 --> 14:13.020
Okay. Classic stakeout scenario, right?

14:13.145 --> 14:16.106
No, Alex. No stakeout.
This is more about hacking and tracking.

14:16.732 --> 14:18.442
Now, take a look at this guest list.

14:21.612 --> 14:25.282
You got to be kidding me. This is like
a who's who of international bad guys.

14:25.365 --> 14:28.660
Obviously, Gundars is using
this party as cover to auction the plane.

14:29.703 --> 14:31.663
Your mission is to get
into Gundars' palace,

14:31.747 --> 14:34.708
find out where the plane is
and stop him from selling it.

14:34.875 --> 14:38.295
You put all these heavy hitters in one
place and security's gonna be insane.

14:38.378 --> 14:42.591
Exactly. The way we see it, there's only
one shot we've got of getting you in there.

14:44.843 --> 14:45.928
Stakeout?

14:48.555 --> 14:49.765
No.

14:49.932 --> 14:51.266
We've arranged cover.

14:52.976 --> 14:55.562
You'll be working with
a civilian to secure entry.

14:55.813 --> 14:56.980
A civilian?

14:57.439 --> 15:00.442
<i>57 and 0. Getting ready to be 58 and 0.
You know how Kelly Robinson do.</i>

15:00.526 --> 15:03.403
Listen to me now.
I don't care what General Patton says.

15:03.487 --> 15:05.739
We don't need to do it this way.
I think if...

15:06.031 --> 15:07.741
<i>I kicked ass all around the world,
you know me.</i>

15:07.825 --> 15:11.078
For crying out loud. Can we turn this off
or change the channel or something?

15:11.161 --> 15:12.579
This guy gives me a headache...

15:12.663 --> 15:15.582
<i>You better watch what come out your mouth
next, little blond-haired surfer boy.</i>

15:15.666 --> 15:18.210
He never shuts up.
Now he's lighting into some poor reporter.

15:18.293 --> 15:21.421
<i>No, I'm talking to you.
Better watch what's coming out your mouth.</i>

15:21.505 --> 15:24.133
<i>You digging your grave with your tongue.
You gonna get your ass whipped.</i>

15:25.342 --> 15:26.677
Video conference.

15:26.885 --> 15:29.888
Alex Scott, meet Kelly Robinson.

15:29.972 --> 15:31.014
Hoo, boy!

15:44.570 --> 15:45.863
That's gotta be him.

15:56.081 --> 15:59.501
Yeah, girl, you crazy. Come on out here
and give me some sugar, girl.

16:00.711 --> 16:03.130
I had too much fun last night. And you too.

16:05.465 --> 16:08.969
Let's bounce.
I got y'all's numbers. I'll call y'all soon.

16:09.052 --> 16:11.013
I'll talk to you all soon. Bye-bye.

16:11.096 --> 16:13.307
No Kelly, no stretchie. Back of the bus.

16:13.390 --> 16:14.558
Move everything to the back.

16:14.641 --> 16:16.643
Move the camouflage booty
to the back of the bus.

16:21.231 --> 16:23.692
Hey, I'm Alex Scott.
We met yesterday, sort of.

16:23.775 --> 16:26.445
Yeah, I remember. The pleasure's all mine.

16:27.863 --> 16:28.947
Yeah...

16:29.031 --> 16:30.157
Is that your plane?

16:30.240 --> 16:32.075
Hey, step away from the man. No autographs!

16:32.159 --> 16:34.286
It's all right, Jerry.
This guy's my new assistant.

16:34.369 --> 16:36.330
Whoa, Kelly,
I thought I was your assistant.

16:36.413 --> 16:39.583
Hey, T.J., what'd I tell you?
The secret mission, right? Secret mission.

16:39.666 --> 16:41.168
Secret mission.

16:41.960 --> 16:45.005
- Yeah, yeah, the Mission Man.
- Right. Right.

16:51.762 --> 16:55.224
It's not a good idea to tell them who I am.
I think we should try to keep that down.

16:55.307 --> 16:57.643
Hey, man, relax, I ain't no fool.
I ain't tell them who you was.

16:57.726 --> 17:00.687
I told them the mission was I had to take
care of the President's retarded nephew.

17:00.771 --> 17:03.607
- Wait a second, what?
- Yeah, they think you're a retard, man.

17:03.732 --> 17:04.775
Wha...

17:04.942 --> 17:08.111
All you gotta do is get you some drool,
a plastic helmet and zip your jacket up tight.

17:08.194 --> 17:10.071
You get that mentally challenged look.
You'll pull it off.

17:10.155 --> 17:12.657
Hold on just a second. That's good.

17:12.991 --> 17:16.286
- Can I talk to you for a second?
- Yeah, go ahead. What's up?

17:18.454 --> 17:21.875
Excuse us. Uncomfortable.
Too many brothers standing around.

17:22.459 --> 17:24.044
We're getting off on the wrong foot.

17:24.127 --> 17:26.546
You're thinking
you're going to be the Harlem Globetrotters

17:26.630 --> 17:28.882
and I'm gonna be the team
that stands there and looks like an idiot.

17:28.966 --> 17:31.718
- Yeah, that's it.
- But that's not how it's gonna work.

17:31.802 --> 17:34.388
We're going to be on the same team.
In fact, I'm Meadowlark Lemon.

17:34.471 --> 17:37.557
You're Curly Neal.
You feed me the ball. Remember Curly, he...

17:37.641 --> 17:39.601
Yeah, he did all the dribbling.
And you Meadowlark?

17:39.685 --> 17:42.646
Exactly. I'm pulling down the ref's shorts,
throwing pie in the face.

17:42.729 --> 17:45.023
- You got the bucket of confetti.
- They think it's water.

17:45.107 --> 17:47.818
- And the rubber band on the ball.
- Right, doing the...

17:47.901 --> 17:50.904
I like all that. Tell you what, Meadowlark,
you get me some of this chicken,

17:50.988 --> 17:54.574
some of these sodas and get these bags
and get your ass on the plane.

17:54.658 --> 17:57.411
"Meadowlark."
You heard what he just said to me?

17:57.494 --> 18:01.248
He told me that in this situation,
he would be Meadowlark and I'm Curly.

18:01.331 --> 18:05.502
What kind of bullshit is that?
Curly, my ass. I'm Meadowlark...

18:10.132 --> 18:12.718
- I'm not Kelly Robinson.
- No, you ain't no Kelly Robinson.

18:12.801 --> 18:14.261
Kelly Robinson don't make
his own phone calls.

18:14.344 --> 18:15.762
Kelly Robinson don't even call his mama!

18:15.846 --> 18:19.057
Come on, now. I'm just trying to
confirm the man's reservation.

18:19.141 --> 18:20.934
- All we need is a room.
- That's all.

18:21.018 --> 18:23.979
- Don't make me get on that phone.
- What the hell is...

18:26.940 --> 18:29.526
It means, "Of course I speak English,
just not to you, sucker."

18:29.776 --> 18:31.361
Guys, I speak Hungarian. Need some help?

18:32.446 --> 18:34.197
Okay. Yeah, knock yourself out.

18:34.406 --> 18:35.657
The brother gonna speak Hungarian now.

18:37.325 --> 18:38.368
<i>- Szia.</i>
- Hello?

18:38.535 --> 18:39.536
<i>Igen, igen.</i>

18:39.953 --> 18:43.206
You guys want the junior suite
or the high-roller suite?

18:44.166 --> 18:45.959
We go with the high-roller.

18:52.924 --> 18:54.885
- It's all taken care of.
- Did you get an extra <i>kusenum?</i>

18:55.969 --> 18:57.929
I'm gonna hustle up
and get these bags onboard.

18:58.013 --> 18:59.097
Don't wanna get yelled at again.

18:59.181 --> 19:00.557
Yeah, yeah. Hustle. Hustle on.

19:01.975 --> 19:04.728
You better watch your job.
Rain Man got skills.

19:11.151 --> 19:12.903
Kelly just took the stick.

19:12.986 --> 19:14.821
I thought he was doing a phone interview.

19:14.905 --> 19:16.531
What interview? The man was napping.

19:16.615 --> 19:19.785
What? Now he's flying the plane?
Come on, Kelly!

19:22.996 --> 19:25.999
Excuse me, sir, but there's a lot of stuff
for us to go over...

19:26.083 --> 19:28.126
Didn't you see me turn on
the "fasten seat belt" light?

19:28.418 --> 19:29.461
No, I didn't see that.

19:35.926 --> 19:38.095
Sit your ass down!
When you get up, sit down.

19:41.973 --> 19:43.141
Funny.

19:44.017 --> 19:47.479
He's a funny guy.
I gotta remember that one.

19:48.396 --> 19:52.067
When you did the stick up,
I went flying there! That's a good little trick.

19:52.275 --> 19:54.486
I'm glad you got that out of your system.

19:54.736 --> 19:56.947
So back to business.
I'm gonna need you at the party at 8:00.

19:57.030 --> 20:00.283
You know something, spy guy? We got to
change the schedule around a little bit.

20:00.367 --> 20:03.245
Kelly Robinson don't be going to no
parties at 8:00. I ain't about to start.

20:03.537 --> 20:06.331
Are you gonna be referring to yourself
in the third person the whole time?

20:06.414 --> 20:07.874
'Cause that can get a little irritating.

20:07.958 --> 20:10.377
Well, it's not gonna get
irritating until 11:00,

20:10.460 --> 20:12.045
'cause that's when
I'm showing up for your little party.

20:14.297 --> 20:16.716
Okay. Excuse me, gents.

20:18.927 --> 20:21.680
I can't risk that.
The party could be clearing out by 11:00.

20:21.972 --> 20:24.933
Look, ain't no party that Kelly Robinson
gonna be at gonna end at 11:00.

20:25.142 --> 20:27.310
You know, that's the type of attitude
that can destroy a mission.

20:27.477 --> 20:28.728
You know what can destroy a mission?

20:28.812 --> 20:31.106
A lame-ass party that end at 11:00.

20:31.189 --> 20:33.108
Let the shit go, man.
I ain't going till 11:00.

20:33.191 --> 20:34.985
- Okay, drop the shit.
- Okay.

20:35.443 --> 20:36.987
I'll get T.J. or Jerry to get me in.

20:37.821 --> 20:39.406
Yeah, go get T.J. He'll help you.

20:39.614 --> 20:42.909
I just hope that the optical
diaphanous polyalloy transducers

20:42.993 --> 20:44.536
can fit on one of their retinas.

20:45.495 --> 20:46.663
What you say? What you got over there?

20:47.497 --> 20:50.792
This right here. It's one of the little things
we got for the mission. It's pretty cool.

20:50.876 --> 20:53.753
It opens up here.
I put this in my eye, this little camera,

20:53.837 --> 20:57.048
and then I give this to T.J.
Then he's able to see everything I see.

20:57.132 --> 20:58.216
Wait a second here.

20:59.843 --> 21:02.721
I don't know if I want T.J.'s eye juices
all over something that goes in my eye.

21:02.804 --> 21:04.764
Maybe I should try that.
What you call it, poly what?

21:04.848 --> 21:06.308
Polyalloy transducers.

21:06.391 --> 21:08.768
The polyalloy should be for me.

21:08.852 --> 21:10.020
Let me put it in my eye, then.

21:10.937 --> 21:13.023
- I put this in my eye?
- Put it in your eye.

21:13.190 --> 21:14.649
- This is some spy shit?
- Yeah.

21:14.733 --> 21:16.151
Okay, I'll put this in.

21:17.319 --> 21:18.862
And I got the camera in my eye.

21:19.196 --> 21:20.947
What's gonna happen now?

21:21.031 --> 21:22.574
- Can you see anything?
- No.

21:23.408 --> 21:24.451
What about now?

21:26.119 --> 21:28.246
- Hey, I see me!
- Look, watch this.

21:28.330 --> 21:30.582
That's bad. Shit, now I see the TV.

21:30.665 --> 21:32.292
- I'm seeing what you seeing.
- Exactly.

21:32.375 --> 21:34.544
I see me looking at you looking at me!

21:34.753 --> 21:36.546
Hey, Kelly Robinson.

21:36.922 --> 21:40.717
Look at this. Put this behind your ear.
It's a listening device.

21:41.092 --> 21:43.345
- Just stick it back here?
- Can you hear me?

21:43.553 --> 21:46.806
Yeah, it sound like you in my head.
Shit, I like this!

21:46.890 --> 21:48.683
That's the type of thing
we're gonna be doing on the mission.

21:48.767 --> 21:50.810
- At 11:00, though.
- No, not 11:00.

21:50.894 --> 21:54.481
11:00. I already spoke. Kelly Robinson
has spoke. I said 11:00, it's 11:00.

21:54.564 --> 21:55.941
It's a dead issue. Let it go.

21:56.733 --> 21:59.069
Look at me. I said 11:00, God damn it!
Get out my face!

21:59.236 --> 22:01.738
- That shit is bad.
- Then give them back.

22:01.821 --> 22:03.823
I ain't giving back shit. Take them.

22:03.907 --> 22:06.576
That look funny, look like I'm yelling at me.
Take them back, punk!

22:06.952 --> 22:10.163
I'm Kelly Robinson, baby, 57 and 0!
I'll kick your ass, baby!

22:10.247 --> 22:11.915
That's what it look like
when I'm whupping somebody's ass?

22:11.998 --> 22:14.334
That's scary as hell.

22:14.417 --> 22:16.920
That's scary. Kelly.
Oh, yeah, that's scary.

22:17.003 --> 22:19.256
Look at that move. Kelly Robinson.

22:21.925 --> 22:24.302
Why you staring at me?
Do something with your time.

22:24.386 --> 22:26.930
- "Okay, Kelly."
- I heard that in my head.

22:27.430 --> 22:29.933
You looking in the cockpit right now.
That's a trip.

22:31.059 --> 22:34.521
- What's our altitude?
- About 37,000 feet.

22:34.854 --> 22:37.440
What's that? Is that a little Cessna
out there on the horizon?

22:37.524 --> 22:38.525
Where?

22:41.027 --> 22:43.113
Hey! Surfer boy!

22:45.448 --> 22:47.450
- You seeing this, Kelly?
- What are you doing?

22:47.534 --> 22:50.328
- Come fly the plane.
- Wake him back up!

22:50.412 --> 22:53.248
- He fell asleep.
- You put that dart in his back!

22:53.331 --> 22:55.041
I thought you knew how to fly it.

22:55.125 --> 22:56.293
- Wake him up.
- You better fly it.

22:56.376 --> 22:57.711
I don't know how to fly no plane!

22:57.794 --> 23:00.880
He put it on automatic, I hold the stick.

23:00.964 --> 23:04.050
The deal is, we go at 8:00,
and I wake the pilot up.

23:05.302 --> 23:08.972
Okay, then let the plane crash.
Let it crash.

23:09.055 --> 23:10.974
You know that ride I just took?
Get ready for a great ride.

23:11.057 --> 23:14.102
I'm ready to die, baby. I'm Kelly Robinson.

23:14.185 --> 23:16.980
Death? Ha, ha! That's how I feel about death.
Go on. Crash it.

23:23.361 --> 23:25.405
This is getting crazy. Wake the man up.

23:25.488 --> 23:27.615
- Do we have a deal?
- Yes. Just wake the man up!

23:30.827 --> 23:33.163
Hey, Ken. He ain't woke.

23:33.246 --> 23:34.581
He'll wake up. He'll be fine.

23:34.664 --> 23:37.792
- So you a pilot this whole time?
- I can fly a little.

23:38.043 --> 23:40.170
Okay, I see how this is gonna work.

23:40.253 --> 23:41.463
I ain't coming to no party at 8:00.

23:41.546 --> 23:43.757
I told you 11:00. Here's your eye shit.

23:43.840 --> 23:45.884
- Hey, be careful with that.
- "Hey," my ass.

23:46.343 --> 23:50.472
If you broke something in my plane,
if something in my plane is broke...

24:04.486 --> 24:06.154
You in trouble, T.J.

24:10.158 --> 24:11.659
Oh, God.

24:15.997 --> 24:17.749
It wasn't my fault, man.
It was Mission Man.

24:18.416 --> 24:19.918
I'm going downstairs!

24:20.001 --> 24:21.961
No, we in the basement. I'm going upstairs.

24:22.045 --> 24:26.383
Y'all got five minutes to get my ass into
the most expensive suite in this hotel,

24:26.549 --> 24:29.386
- or else, T.J.! Or else!
- Or else what?

24:29.552 --> 24:33.807
I... I... I don't know what else,
because I don't think good underground.

24:33.890 --> 24:36.226
But whatever it is, it's gonna be bad!

24:36.309 --> 24:37.477
Let me tell you something. You falling off.

24:37.560 --> 24:41.022
Your ass is gonna be back in St. Louis,
frying fish in your father's fish store.

24:41.106 --> 24:45.777
Now, you mess up
one more time again. I'm waiting.

24:45.860 --> 24:48.446
Please do it one more.
Just please. One more time.

24:48.530 --> 24:50.323
One more time.
Please let him do it one more time.

24:51.282 --> 24:52.659
Oh, my God.

24:55.578 --> 24:57.247
Hey! How's the room?

24:58.665 --> 25:02.252
My room is fine. Oh, did I say 11:00?
I meant to say 12:00. Maybe.

25:03.044 --> 25:04.838
- What's with the attitude?
- Excuse me!

25:05.588 --> 25:07.340
Kelly Robinson? The famous boxer?

25:07.423 --> 25:08.633
Yeah, one and the same, baby.

25:08.716 --> 25:13.179
- I can't believe it!
- It's a big thrill for you, huh?

25:13.263 --> 25:18.143
You don't know. I know you
from your advertisement for your perfume.

25:19.060 --> 25:21.354
- Kelly Robinson. TKO.
- TKO. That's right.

25:21.437 --> 25:23.231
It's not perfume. It's cologne.

25:23.314 --> 25:25.567
Perfume is for ladies and sissies.
I put out cologne.

25:25.650 --> 25:27.652
I so stupid.

25:28.611 --> 25:30.905
So, Kelly, tell me...

25:32.323 --> 25:34.284
Do you really wear it?

25:36.286 --> 25:37.579
Well, you tell me.

25:43.668 --> 25:46.171
I'd love to go to your room
and get your autograph.

25:46.296 --> 25:50.466
Is that right? I'd really love to,
but unfortunately, my room ain't ready.

25:52.010 --> 25:56.097
Let's go to mine. Is very, very close.

25:56.723 --> 25:59.726
Hey, hey. Wrong. Wrong. Wrong. Excuse me.

26:00.185 --> 26:02.979
No. Come here for a second.
Excuse me.

26:03.062 --> 26:05.231
- Don't you move. What's wrong with you?
- What are you doing?

26:05.648 --> 26:07.859
Nothing. But if you let go of my arm,
in about five minutes

26:07.942 --> 26:09.569
I'm gonna go across the street
and wax that ass.

26:09.652 --> 26:13.156
Listen to me. For all intents and purposes,
you are a spy right now.

26:13.239 --> 26:15.742
I can't have you running off
with some strange Hungarian woman.

26:15.825 --> 26:19.162
I'm Kelly Robinson, 57 and 0.
Going off with a strange woman is what I do.

26:19.495 --> 26:22.373
Mind your own business. Let me go do this.
Have a good evening, all right?

26:22.832 --> 26:25.668
- I guess I'm just jealous.
- I can understand, but she chose Kelly.

26:25.752 --> 26:27.879
Look, I'll hit it once for you, all right?
Good night.

26:28.504 --> 26:29.672
See if she's got a sister.

26:29.756 --> 26:32.759
If she got a sister, I ain't gonna call your ass.
It's gonna be the three of us.

26:32.842 --> 26:36.471
Why don't you go see the city?
What you say your name was?

26:36.554 --> 26:40.266
- Are you going to scream it?
- Yes, I will scream your name if I know it.

26:41.309 --> 26:44.395
I had a couple of interesting
situations where...

26:44.771 --> 26:46.856
- What happened?
- The girl tried to press charges...

26:46.940 --> 26:48.191
Hey, hey!

26:49.525 --> 26:51.694
Hey, slow it down! I got a lady over here.

26:56.741 --> 26:58.785
Hey, that's some serious road rage.

26:59.077 --> 27:01.913
What's up, man? What's all this?

27:05.750 --> 27:08.544
How long have you been working
for the U.S. government?

27:08.711 --> 27:10.380
I work for the United States
of Kelly Robinson.

27:10.546 --> 27:12.465
There was BNS agent on your jet.

27:12.548 --> 27:14.217
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- Who was he?

27:14.300 --> 27:15.969
Hey, man, y'all been reading
too many spy novels.

27:16.052 --> 27:18.054
Maybe we should cut off his penis.

27:18.721 --> 27:21.557
Cut off my penis? Why would you
go straight to "cut off his penis"?

27:21.641 --> 27:22.684
What happened to "rough the man up"?

27:22.767 --> 27:24.769
- Cut it off!
- Wait a second, now calm down!

27:24.936 --> 27:28.815
You ain't cutting off nobody's penis!
I'll answer all your questions, but...

27:29.399 --> 27:32.068
- Who's the agent?
- I'm not sure if he's an agent.

27:32.151 --> 27:36.447
- Who's the agent?
- I don't know if he's an agent or not!

27:36.531 --> 27:39.867
- Okay, he's 5'9", he's got blond hair...
- His name?

27:39.993 --> 27:44.163
I'm not sure, but he's very annoying.
He's definitely a BNS agent.

27:44.247 --> 27:45.248
His name?

27:45.331 --> 27:49.127
Y'all got these knives and guns pointing
at me, so I'm blocking!

27:49.294 --> 27:51.838
He got one of them white names. Alan or...

27:51.921 --> 27:54.674
- Take off his pants.
- Why? Why you gonna take my pants off?

27:54.757 --> 27:56.801
Please don't cut off
Kelly Robinson's penis.

27:58.928 --> 28:00.013
Freeze!

28:12.275 --> 28:14.485
Kelly! Kelly, shoot her!

28:15.862 --> 28:17.697
Shoot her! Kelly, shoot her!

28:18.031 --> 28:19.282
Shoot her!

28:24.620 --> 28:25.788
Did I kill her?

28:27.498 --> 28:29.459
Oh! Not yet.

28:29.542 --> 28:31.711
- Hey!
- Kelly, Kelly!

28:31.794 --> 28:33.755
- Stop shooting that.
- What the hell's going...

28:35.840 --> 28:39.302
I'm sorry, I'm being rude.
Special Agent Rachel Wright.

28:39.969 --> 28:42.680
- Nice to officially meet you.
- You're a spy!

28:43.139 --> 28:44.349
Don't tell anyone.

28:45.058 --> 28:46.893
- You're all BNS?
- It's all BNS.

28:46.976 --> 28:49.645
- Big fan, Mr. Robinson!
- Crazy way of showing it.

28:50.730 --> 28:53.983
- God, Alex, you been working out?
- Yeah, a little. Why?

28:54.192 --> 28:57.236
- You just got buff.
- Just doing curls.

28:58.154 --> 28:59.697
Two, three drops of me come out of this.

29:00.365 --> 29:03.826
I hope you didn't mind. Alex wanted
to test you before we put you in the game.

29:04.535 --> 29:06.913
- So this whole thing was a big test?
- Yep.

29:06.996 --> 29:08.539
Unbelievable. That was great.

29:09.457 --> 29:10.917
- Really?
- Really.

29:11.000 --> 29:12.168
Oh, cool.

29:12.335 --> 29:15.171
- Guys, excuse us for a second.
- Yeah.

29:15.254 --> 29:17.965
- Hey, good job.
- Nice work, nice work. Good.

29:20.134 --> 29:22.887
I have seen hundreds of agents

29:22.970 --> 29:26.307
put through that exercise,
and I've never seen it handled so well.

29:26.391 --> 29:27.725
Never. Never.

29:28.017 --> 29:29.727
Yeah. Well, Kelly Robinson.

29:30.311 --> 29:32.897
It was like your instincts,
every step of the way, were perfect.

29:32.980 --> 29:35.191
Give them a little information,
but nothing important.

29:35.400 --> 29:37.527
Like he's blond, 5'9".

29:37.610 --> 29:39.112
How many guys fit that description?

29:39.195 --> 29:42.407
That doesn't mean anything.
You were never gonna name names.

29:43.199 --> 29:44.575
You know what you are, my friend?

29:44.909 --> 29:47.870
You're a "why not" guy,
as opposed to a "why" guy.

29:48.204 --> 29:49.872
- What's the difference?
- A "why" guy's like,

29:49.997 --> 29:52.041
"Why are we gonna do this?"
"Why are we gonna do that?"

29:52.125 --> 29:54.836
They're scared.
They're afraid to make a decision.

29:54.919 --> 29:58.005
Afraid they might get in trouble.
As opposed to a "why not" guy.

29:58.089 --> 29:59.841
He's like, "Roll the dice." Man of action.

29:59.924 --> 30:01.634
That's me.
Kelly Robinson's a "why not" guy.

30:02.009 --> 30:04.554
The "why not" guys are like eagles.
They don't flock.

30:04.887 --> 30:06.806
The few, the proud, the "why not."

30:06.889 --> 30:09.600
The President wouldn't have called me
if I wasn't a "why not" guy.

30:09.684 --> 30:10.685
Exactly.

30:10.768 --> 30:12.311
Let me see everything
that's going on with this mission.

30:12.395 --> 30:14.564
Now, Kelly,
we gotta get you up to speed.

30:15.273 --> 30:17.442
What you're about to hear
is a national secret.

30:17.900 --> 30:21.863
See this man?
This is Arnold Gundars, premier arms dealer.

30:22.071 --> 30:24.824
We believe he has this plane,
the Switchblade.

30:24.907 --> 30:28.494
It's a sophisticated prototype stolen
from the U.S. government.

30:28.578 --> 30:31.247
The Switchblade is
the next generation of stealth technology.

30:31.414 --> 30:34.459
Undetectable to radar,
infrared, even the human eye.

30:34.917 --> 30:36.127
Our mission is to get it back.

30:36.586 --> 30:38.254
To make a long story short,

30:38.337 --> 30:41.048
we can't find it, because we can't see it.

30:42.800 --> 30:45.803
Here it is with the electrochromatic
cloaking device engaged.

30:46.846 --> 30:48.472
That's like one of those bugs
that look like a leaf.

30:48.556 --> 30:50.016
- One of the who?
- On the Nature Channel

30:50.099 --> 30:53.436
sometimes they have a bug that
stays safe because it looks like a leaf.

30:53.519 --> 30:57.023
But it don't really look like a leaf.
It can make itself look like a leaf.

30:57.106 --> 30:59.275
A leafy bug. It's a good name for it.

30:59.358 --> 31:01.652
You should call that the "Leafy Bug."

31:02.236 --> 31:04.614
- That's a good idea.
- I'll pass that on.

31:04.780 --> 31:07.408
The Leafy Bug. We gotta go.

31:07.491 --> 31:09.076
We'll be late for the mission.
It's almost 8:00.

31:09.660 --> 31:11.370
You owe me for one belt. Yamaguchi.

31:11.454 --> 31:12.496
Hey, man, you got a cell phone?

31:12.580 --> 31:14.665
- Tuxedo.
- I'm gonna set that all up.

31:14.957 --> 31:19.378
Hey, Alex, I'm sorry I kneed you
and roughed you up in there. You okay?

31:19.462 --> 31:23.049
My gosh, don't be ridiculous.
No, I'm fine. I thought that was great.

31:23.466 --> 31:25.259
When you kneed me, I loved that.

31:25.843 --> 31:30.223
- You did? You loved that?
- Well, I... I just felt it helped sell it.

31:30.306 --> 31:31.807
Made it convincing.

31:34.143 --> 31:35.561
Don't forget, wait to turn this on.

31:35.645 --> 31:38.105
The satellite's only good
for the next 72 hours.

31:38.189 --> 31:39.649
Let's hope that's more than we need.

31:40.191 --> 31:42.109
All right, set us up. You know the drill.

31:42.193 --> 31:44.320
- Hey, what's in that bag?
- Spy stuff.

31:45.154 --> 31:47.156
Rule number one,
always have a sure way out.

31:47.949 --> 31:49.659
- Hey, Rachel.
- What's up?

31:51.369 --> 31:53.329
It's weird.
It feels like a stakeout, doesn't it?

31:54.413 --> 31:55.748
No. Not really.

32:22.441 --> 32:23.901
And we are live.

32:27.488 --> 32:28.614
Hey, what's that for?

32:28.864 --> 32:33.452
This, my friend, is how I break this case
wide open, with your help of course.

32:33.869 --> 32:36.038
It's an exact replica
of the pen Gundars carries.

32:36.122 --> 32:38.582
There's an IHB tracking device
built into the chamber.

32:38.833 --> 32:40.126
Technology.

32:40.251 --> 32:43.379
If Alex can plant it on him,
we can follow his movements.

32:43.462 --> 32:45.006
Okay. Let's do this, then.

32:47.508 --> 32:50.970
Nice shifting, Rachel.
I know these stick shifts can be a little tricky.

32:51.053 --> 32:52.305
You make it look easy.

32:54.265 --> 32:55.558
Thank you.

32:58.227 --> 33:00.646
Surfer Boy, please tell me you
didn't just say, "Nice shifting."

33:00.730 --> 33:03.399
- Don't worry about it, okay?
- You really like that girl, huh?

33:03.566 --> 33:05.067
- Rachel? No.
- Yes, you do.

33:06.235 --> 33:07.320
- Mr. Robinson!
- Hey.

33:07.403 --> 33:08.571
Welcome!

33:08.654 --> 33:09.989
I am very big fan.

33:10.072 --> 33:11.365
How you doing? You a fan too?

33:11.490 --> 33:14.618
It's going around, baby.
How you doing? Kelly Robinson, 57 and 0.

33:15.036 --> 33:16.912
- You got that?
- No, no, no, I'm with him.

33:17.455 --> 33:21.042
Kelly! Tell these guys I'm with you.
I'm with the boxer.

33:21.542 --> 33:22.501
I've never seen that man before.

33:22.585 --> 33:24.545
Take him around back, shoot him in his ass.

33:24.628 --> 33:27.340
- Hey, no, he's...
- I'm just playing. It's a joke.

33:27.423 --> 33:30.259
Don't shoot the guy. Let him go,
he's with me. Sorry about that, guys.

33:30.843 --> 33:32.136
That's a bad start.

33:32.470 --> 33:35.056
That's revenge for that hotel back there.
Now we're even.

33:35.598 --> 33:37.767
Okay, you did your job.
Now let me do mine.

33:39.226 --> 33:41.645
Yeah. Yeah. All right.

33:44.398 --> 33:46.108
Kelly Robinson, y'all, in the flesh.

33:47.151 --> 33:50.404
Y'all looking at the fastest man in the world!
Y'all can do better than that!

33:51.947 --> 33:56.285
Y'all ready for the Slugfest in Budapest?
Are you? That's good.

33:56.535 --> 33:57.787
Yeah! How y'all doing?

33:57.870 --> 34:00.581
Hello, Mr. Robinson.
This is great honor to meet you.

34:00.790 --> 34:04.794
Hey, look, it's an honor for me to
let you meet me. How about that, huh?

34:05.044 --> 34:07.088
All right, good meeting you. Take it easy.

34:07.380 --> 34:09.757
I like him. I like the way he talks. Cute.

34:09.840 --> 34:12.717
- You just met Marwan Motaheeshi.
- Who's that?

34:12.802 --> 34:14.762
He controls death squads
that he hires out around the world.

34:14.844 --> 34:17.264
They kill thousands
of innocent people every year.

34:17.723 --> 34:18.724
Damn.

34:20.476 --> 34:22.561
- All right, here he comes.
- That's Gundars?

34:22.645 --> 34:25.648
That's a bad-ass
jacket he got on. Turn around.

34:25.731 --> 34:28.900
- Yeah, okay.
- Disappear. Get away.

34:28.984 --> 34:30.194
I won't disappear. I'll do the pen.

34:30.277 --> 34:31.737
Give me the pen. Give it back.

34:31.821 --> 34:33.322
You better back up before...

34:33.406 --> 34:34.739
Mr. Robinson. Good to meet you.

34:35.366 --> 34:37.034
Yes. Mr. Gundars, the pleasure's all mine.

34:37.159 --> 34:41.038
Thank you. Your fight here
promises to be the most exciting event

34:41.121 --> 34:43.081
that Budapest has seen in quite some time.

34:43.165 --> 34:44.917
Look, since you such a nice guy,

34:45.000 --> 34:47.085
I ain't gonna break your boy up too bad.
How about that?

34:47.168 --> 34:48.379
- Thank you.
- Yeah. Yeah.

34:48.462 --> 34:51.090
Mr. Robinson, here's your champagne.
Oh, thank you so much.

34:51.172 --> 34:52.257
I'm sorry to interrupt you.

34:52.425 --> 34:55.094
If you'd be so kind, one of the ladies
in the fountain requests an autograph.

34:55.177 --> 34:57.680
No problem at all, but
you have a pen I could use?

34:59.557 --> 35:00.599
I don't.

35:00.683 --> 35:03.018
Didn't I tell you at
all times to keep a pen?

35:03.185 --> 35:05.604
- I apologize.
- You're walking around here penless.

35:05.771 --> 35:07.773
It won't happen again.
I said to have a pen...

35:08.274 --> 35:11.527
Mr. Gundars.
Mr. Gundars is always prepared.

35:11.610 --> 35:14.196
Thank you. Hold this champagne.

35:14.280 --> 35:16.115
You have to be prepared at all times.

35:17.366 --> 35:19.618
I'm really disappointed,
I want you to know.

35:19.702 --> 35:21.162
Take that. Here you go.

35:22.705 --> 35:26.208
Clown ass. It's hard to get somebody
that'll do their job the right way.

35:28.252 --> 35:29.628
I'm sorry about that. Force of habit.

35:29.712 --> 35:31.046
Here's your pen, Mr. Gundars.

35:35.426 --> 35:38.095
- Well, enjoy the party.
- Yeah.

35:38.262 --> 35:40.556
Nice to see you. I have some business.

35:40.639 --> 35:43.434
Take care of your business.
Take care of your business, Mr. Gundars.

35:43.684 --> 35:45.227
Hey, you a real player.

35:46.145 --> 35:47.563
Gundars.

35:49.732 --> 35:51.650
I had it under control until you showed up.

35:51.734 --> 35:53.068
I know you did.

35:53.235 --> 35:56.155
Okay, he's taking off.
I need you to create a distraction.

35:56.489 --> 35:59.074
Create a distraction?
What do you mean? Do what?

35:59.158 --> 36:01.494
Make a scene or do something.
That should come easy for you.

36:01.577 --> 36:03.204
- Make a scene.
- Make a scene?

36:05.664 --> 36:08.000
Yeah! Baddest man on the planet!

36:08.334 --> 36:12.087
Cedric Mills, where you at?
Come on, everybody. Cedric, where you at?

36:12.171 --> 36:14.590
Let's get a show going here.
Where's Cedric Mills?

36:14.715 --> 36:17.051
Everybody gather around. Hey, come on.

36:17.134 --> 36:20.638
Break that up. Come on, y'all look
great, but get out the ring.

36:20.930 --> 36:23.766
It's about me and Cedric.
Cedric Mills, where you at?

36:24.099 --> 36:25.768
Hey, Cedric! You in the house?

36:25.935 --> 36:28.103
I know I seen you! There you go, Cedric.

36:28.187 --> 36:31.565
What you doing down there?
Having a steroid cocktail?

36:31.941 --> 36:33.442
I do not take the steroids.

36:33.609 --> 36:35.986
You gonna need something
if you gonna get in the ring with me.

36:36.070 --> 36:37.446
Let's give the people a preview.

36:37.530 --> 36:40.533
Don't be scared. I ain't gonna hurt you.

36:40.616 --> 36:44.161
Cedric Mills, everybody!
In the flesh! That's a brave man there.

36:44.245 --> 36:47.498
That's like swimming with Jaws.

36:50.334 --> 36:51.627
Well.

36:52.962 --> 36:54.088
Are you ready?

36:54.797 --> 36:56.549
I want to see the plane first.

36:57.132 --> 37:00.135
I'm sorry, but only the highest bidder
will have that privilege.

37:00.386 --> 37:02.304
Is it really invisible?

37:04.223 --> 37:06.350
How long have you been in Budapest?

37:07.226 --> 37:09.520
- Three days.
- Three days.

37:09.603 --> 37:12.898
Well, you've probably driven past it
at least half a dozen times.

37:13.816 --> 37:15.985
Now, if you'd enter your bid
into the computer.

37:25.244 --> 37:27.079
You know,
I usually make all the predictions,

37:27.162 --> 37:28.414
but let's do a little flip.

37:28.497 --> 37:29.748
Let's let Cedric make the predictions.

37:29.832 --> 37:33.627
Cedric, what round do you think
I'm gonna knock you out in?

37:34.628 --> 37:36.171
Hey, you stop jokes now.

37:36.255 --> 37:37.423
- Or what?
- Or I will!

37:37.506 --> 37:39.341
You gonna stop...
He's incredible, isn't he? Isn't he a doll?

37:39.425 --> 37:41.844
Making that mean face.
"I will stop them!" I like that.

37:41.927 --> 37:43.929
Let's give the people a little preview.
Open-handed.

37:44.013 --> 37:45.723
Let's see how fast you are.

37:45.806 --> 37:48.684
Y'all like to see that, wouldn't you?
Open-handed scrap?

37:49.018 --> 37:51.312
Put your hands up.
What you got? How you bringing it?

37:51.520 --> 37:53.355
That's how you move?
That's what you coming with?

37:53.606 --> 37:55.107
You definitely getting your ass whipped.
Tell you what.

37:55.190 --> 37:57.651
I'm gonna hit you in your jaw.
Right jaw with left hand.

37:57.860 --> 37:59.320
Put your guard up, now.
I'm pretty fast, now.

37:59.403 --> 38:01.530
You ready? Here it come.

38:02.031 --> 38:04.033
I told you I was gonna slap you.
Why didn't you block the punch?

38:05.200 --> 38:07.953
What's wrong with you,
coming all hard like that?

38:08.037 --> 38:12.416
You're supposed to give them a taste.
You wanna hit me hard.

38:12.499 --> 38:13.792
What if I kick your ass
in front of everybody?

38:13.876 --> 38:15.419
<i>There you go! A preview.</i>

38:15.502 --> 38:19.089
<i>Robinson vs. Mills.
The transatlantic championship,</i>

38:19.173 --> 38:21.550
<i>tomorrow night, here in Budapest.</i>

38:23.636 --> 38:25.429
- Done.
- Excellent.

38:27.473 --> 38:29.433
Well, the best of luck.

38:30.768 --> 38:32.102
Thank you.

38:33.187 --> 38:35.147
Would you care for a glass of champagne?

38:35.230 --> 38:37.566
We have an excellent fountain.

38:37.691 --> 38:38.692
Yes.

38:38.776 --> 38:41.528
Remember,
an undetectable nuclear delivery system

38:41.612 --> 38:45.157
could transform your tiny country
into a superpower overnight.

39:18.107 --> 39:20.526
Holy shit! What you doing,
hanging from the ceiling like that?

39:20.609 --> 39:23.529
What are you doing here?
You're supposed to be outside. Get lost!

39:23.612 --> 39:26.198
- I figured you'd need help.
- Don't walk in here.

39:26.281 --> 39:28.534
Don't tell me what to do.
I'm Kelly Robinson.

39:28.617 --> 39:31.578
57 and 0. Don't talk to me like that.
What's the problem?

39:31.662 --> 39:33.914
You tripped the alarm.
Yeah, you tripped it.

39:33.997 --> 39:36.291
I don't hear no alarm.
What you talking about?

39:36.583 --> 39:38.168
See this?

39:38.961 --> 39:40.796
- Oh, shit.
- Yeah, oh, shit. Come here.

39:40.879 --> 39:43.716
This is bad. We gonna get caught because
you didn't tell me about the alarm.

39:43.799 --> 39:45.342
- This is your fault.
- Put that on.

39:46.093 --> 39:47.845
- What is this?
- It's a mask. Put it on.

39:48.137 --> 39:50.222
- This look like a sock.
- It's a spy mask.

39:50.305 --> 39:52.307
It's a special spy mask. Put it on.

39:52.391 --> 39:53.809
Look like a sock.

39:54.560 --> 39:56.562
Hey, man, this is a sock! What you doing?

39:56.645 --> 39:58.063
Trying to put this on. Let me do this.

39:58.147 --> 39:59.314
Quit tickling me.

39:59.398 --> 40:00.732
Would you come here?

40:00.816 --> 40:03.235
- Just tell me what's going on.
- I am losing it.

40:03.318 --> 40:06.196
I'm nervous and I'm
ticklish at the same time.

40:06.280 --> 40:09.700
Not in my wildest imagination
did I dream it would be this difficult.

40:09.825 --> 40:13.662
Before you enter your bid, Mr. Abi,
let me remind you

40:14.079 --> 40:16.498
that an undetectable
nuclear delivery system...

40:16.832 --> 40:18.125
- Why we spinning?
- Be still.

40:18.876 --> 40:20.752
- Don't breathe.
- We can't spin like this.

40:20.836 --> 40:23.505
- It's cracking.
- I'm getting queasy

40:23.589 --> 40:25.841
and I don't like heights.
And I'm spinning, and I'm gonna vomit.

40:30.721 --> 40:33.390
What kind of cheap-ass equipment
they send you on this mission with?

40:33.557 --> 40:36.351
- The anchor broke.
- You supposed to check the anchor first.

40:36.435 --> 40:38.187
I wasn't expecting you to be here.

40:39.688 --> 40:40.772
Hey, that's cool.

40:41.023 --> 40:42.774
The funds will be verified overnight

40:42.858 --> 40:45.861
and the highest bidder
will be informed tomorrow.

40:45.944 --> 40:48.614
I would like you to enjoy
our local specialty.

40:48.697 --> 40:50.324
Sir? Sir.

40:53.118 --> 40:54.870
The silent alarm has just been set off.

40:58.248 --> 41:00.918
Please, I need a few moments alone.

41:01.168 --> 41:02.920
- What about my bid?
- Don't worry.

41:03.003 --> 41:05.005
You'll get your chance. Enjoy.

41:05.839 --> 41:07.216
Lock the door.

41:17.893 --> 41:18.894
Get on the roof.

41:18.977 --> 41:21.688
- Just go through the opening.
- You gonna make me fall.

41:21.772 --> 41:22.773
Go through it.

41:22.856 --> 41:24.441
Lock this wing down.

41:25.025 --> 41:28.612
I was born semipsychic, and I had
a bad hunch something would happen.

41:28.695 --> 41:30.322
Then why'd you go into the room?

41:30.405 --> 41:31.907
I'm only semipsychic, I ain't Miss Cleo.

41:33.992 --> 41:35.661
They are on the dome.

41:35.744 --> 41:39.081
It's like you're a double agent.
Like you're working against me.

41:39.748 --> 41:41.458
Just get them. Now.

41:46.922 --> 41:47.923
Oh, man!

41:52.594 --> 41:55.889
- I liked this better when it was a test!
- We gotta jump!

41:55.973 --> 41:57.099
What?

41:57.641 --> 42:00.519
- You crazy? I ain't jumping.
- You got a better idea?

42:00.602 --> 42:02.729
No, but you better come up with something,
'cause I ain't jumping.

42:03.814 --> 42:05.315
Okay, new plan. Wait right here.

42:05.440 --> 42:07.693
What you gonna do? Don't leave me.

42:07.776 --> 42:08.902
- What's that?
- What?

42:11.446 --> 42:12.614
Oh, God!

42:18.370 --> 42:22.207
- Okay, that wasn't that bad.
- What'd I tell you? Are your legs numb?

42:22.291 --> 42:24.001
No, come on. Let's do it. What's next?

42:24.793 --> 42:27.004
Rule number one,
always have a sure way out.

42:27.129 --> 42:28.380
Walk, walk, walk.

42:28.463 --> 42:30.048
Hey! You guys!

42:30.132 --> 42:31.675
Run, run. Now we run. Now we run.

42:47.858 --> 42:48.859
This is your sure way out?

42:48.942 --> 42:50.610
No, it's the way to the sure way out.

42:50.986 --> 42:53.572
- Go through it.
- Come on, man!

43:02.706 --> 43:04.875
Could you move? Look out. Lose the jacket!

43:08.170 --> 43:09.963
Are we still on the way
to the sure way, or is this it?

43:10.088 --> 43:11.840
- This is it, the sure way out.
- This is it?

43:12.215 --> 43:14.092
Okay. Come on.

43:14.217 --> 43:16.011
It's slow, that's why I'm nervous.

43:16.094 --> 43:18.472
- Don't panic yet.
- Look how slow we're moving!

43:24.102 --> 43:26.605
Kelly, it's here.
We are home free, my friend.

43:26.688 --> 43:27.981
There's a guy coming down the steps.

43:28.065 --> 43:29.900
Kick him. Kick him in the balls!

43:29.983 --> 43:31.860
How am I gonna kick him if he got a gun?

43:31.943 --> 43:34.863
- Don't be defeatist! Stay on my side!
- Hey, watch out!

43:41.703 --> 43:43.789
We gonna die.
They're gonna kill Kelly Robinson.

43:43.872 --> 43:45.624
Don't be negative. Check outside!

43:45.832 --> 43:47.751
Hey, that guy's still coming.

43:47.834 --> 43:49.211
I'm gonna get him. I'm gonna get him.

43:50.003 --> 43:51.463
- Tell me when. Now?
- No!

43:51.546 --> 43:53.548
- Now?
- Now!

43:55.675 --> 43:58.178
Okay. Throw it. Lob it over there!

43:58.261 --> 43:59.971
- What's this?
- Smoke grenade. Throw it.

44:00.055 --> 44:02.182
- They got bullets and we got smoke?
- Lob it!

44:05.727 --> 44:06.853
It's smoking.

44:09.147 --> 44:10.565
- Now what?
- Here. Grab this.

44:16.571 --> 44:18.240
I knew you had something
up your sleeve.

44:18.323 --> 44:20.075
- Of course.
- I never doubted you.

44:20.409 --> 44:23.370
- That's right.
- Yeah. All right. Okay.

44:24.162 --> 44:25.747
Now, how we gonna get down from here?

44:26.456 --> 44:28.166
I don't think we have
to worry about that.

44:31.962 --> 44:33.422
Okay, you worried now?

44:33.505 --> 44:34.840
I'm a little worried now.

44:35.715 --> 44:38.593
We'll bring her gently down
on that grassy hill there.

44:38.969 --> 44:40.762
We're going down faster than I want.

44:41.471 --> 44:42.764
Get ready! Brace yourself!

44:42.848 --> 44:44.182
What?

44:48.520 --> 44:50.897
Hey, what happened to the
soft, grassy hill?

44:50.981 --> 44:52.190
We missed it.

44:58.321 --> 44:59.865
Let go when I say so.

44:59.948 --> 45:01.825
Hey, man, I'm not letting go.

45:01.908 --> 45:04.161
You wanna die up here?
We've dodged some bullets,

45:04.244 --> 45:07.789
and I don't know how many
more lives we've got. We gotta let go.

45:09.249 --> 45:10.375
Ready?

45:10.459 --> 45:12.335
Get set. Let go!

45:14.296 --> 45:15.881
I broke my leg. It's broken.

45:15.964 --> 45:18.884
That's what your ass gets
for this crazy balloon shit.

45:19.176 --> 45:21.303
Kelly Robinson hanging from a balloon.

45:21.428 --> 45:24.306
- No, it's okay. It's okay.
- I wish it was broke.

45:32.689 --> 45:35.525
- They're still coming.
- Man, these guys won't give up.

45:35.734 --> 45:38.153
- Now what?
- I wish that balloon worked better.

45:38.236 --> 45:40.572
The balloon is over! What are we gonna do?

45:40.655 --> 45:42.073
Let me think. Hold on.

45:42.157 --> 45:44.409
I got an idea. Move around. Get in the car.

45:44.492 --> 45:47.078
You've got an idea? This I want to see.

45:47.245 --> 45:48.997
Now you be in the hot seat.

45:58.006 --> 45:59.925
I used to be in a different business.

46:00.008 --> 46:02.510
- What are you doing?
- They keep the keys here. See?

46:03.220 --> 46:05.430
- What? You used to transport cars?
- Something like that.

46:08.892 --> 46:09.935
Here we go.

46:30.580 --> 46:32.499
You did it. Showed them something there.

46:34.668 --> 46:36.962
- Hey!
- Okay, I got an idea.

46:37.045 --> 46:38.880
- What you gonna do?
- You inspired me.

46:39.923 --> 46:41.466
We're gonna try a little Carlos.

46:46.304 --> 46:47.597
- What are you doing?
- Pull forward.

46:48.056 --> 46:49.391
- What?
- Pull forward.

46:56.273 --> 46:58.650
- Did you see that?
- Goddamn!

46:58.733 --> 47:00.610
- That was a big explosion.
- Man!

47:07.075 --> 47:09.786
That's why everyone
thinks Carlos is a better spy than me!

47:09.869 --> 47:12.247
- Who's Carlos?
- He's a spy. Everyone thinks he's great.

47:12.330 --> 47:14.958
- He's got more potent bombs than me.
- His bombs are more potent?

47:15.041 --> 47:16.334
- Yeah!
- That ain't right.

47:16.418 --> 47:18.003
There's another one! Here they come.

47:18.086 --> 47:19.212
This one's mine.

47:19.296 --> 47:22.382
Let me show you something
they don't teach over at the BNS.

47:34.311 --> 47:36.187
Oh, wow. That's pretty good.

47:39.899 --> 47:43.028
- You were unbelievable back there.
- Oh, man. That was you.

47:43.111 --> 47:47.240
You had the thing going down,
the Kelly Robinson I had one little bomb.

47:47.324 --> 47:48.950
Little bomb? It was like...

47:49.034 --> 47:50.827
- You must be crazy.
- Here they are.

48:00.128 --> 48:02.964
- Good driving.
- Hey, Kelly Robinson, Kelly Robinson.

48:06.634 --> 48:07.927
What do we got here?

48:08.470 --> 48:10.555
Hey, no outlet in here.
We stuck, man.

48:10.638 --> 48:14.142
Hey, pull over here. Pull right here.
Stop, stop, stop. Give me the keys.

48:15.060 --> 48:18.313
Look what I got! Keys!
Convertible. It's all yours.

48:18.396 --> 48:20.815
We'll make a trade.
You take that car, we'll take your scooter.

48:21.316 --> 48:22.359
Jump on. Jump on!

48:22.442 --> 48:24.694
Kelly Robinson ain't getting
on the back of no scooter like no bitch.

48:25.987 --> 48:28.323
All right. Okay, let's do it. Come on, man.

48:28.406 --> 48:31.284
Get your feet up. Okay. Hold on!

48:38.333 --> 48:40.752
- Hold on. Okay, hold on.
- I am holding on.

48:44.839 --> 48:47.092
Oh... Shit!

48:51.638 --> 48:53.098
Go, go, go!

48:57.602 --> 49:00.480
- It's like a nightmare!
- Yeah, it's a nightmare.

49:00.563 --> 49:01.856
They shooting, and I'm in the back.

49:05.068 --> 49:06.319
You better come up with something.

49:06.403 --> 49:07.612
We'll make a break for daylight.

49:08.613 --> 49:09.781
Tuck your elbows in.

49:30.635 --> 49:34.389
What's that smell? Oh, man.

49:35.140 --> 49:36.558
Go down the tunnel.

49:38.977 --> 49:42.397
- This is the sewer!
- We're stuck. Is there an opening?

49:42.480 --> 49:44.983
There's bars and shit over here.
We can't get out.

49:45.108 --> 49:46.734
Just stand back to the side.

49:46.943 --> 49:48.611
Oh, shit!

49:50.321 --> 49:51.823
You okay?

49:52.824 --> 49:56.870
I made $24 million last year,
and I'm standing in a river of human sludge.

49:56.953 --> 49:58.037
You ask me, am I okay!

49:58.454 --> 50:01.040
You made $24 million last year?

50:02.000 --> 50:03.209
Yeah, 24.7.

50:06.588 --> 50:08.798
- They ain't leaving.
- It's late night.

50:09.382 --> 50:12.927
- We'll wait them out.
- Shit, it stinks down here.

50:13.261 --> 50:14.429
Just don't breathe in too deep.

50:15.471 --> 50:18.099
Methane. Methane'll make you loopy.

50:18.183 --> 50:22.020
I'm gonna get loopy from standing
and breathing in this human...

50:23.021 --> 50:24.522
You know what this is, right?

50:25.023 --> 50:27.942
This is the nastiest
place in all of Hungary.

50:28.985 --> 50:31.154
Are you feeling loopy?
You look a little loopy.

50:31.237 --> 50:34.282
Yes. It feels kind of dizzy. I got a buzz.

50:37.410 --> 50:38.703
Okay.

50:40.163 --> 50:42.207
- Where'd you grow up?
- Hey, man,

50:42.665 --> 50:45.960
no offense, but I ain't one
of those guys that, you know,

50:46.085 --> 50:48.880
start pouring his heart out
and get real personal with another guy,

50:48.963 --> 50:50.798
so save it for somebody else.

50:52.967 --> 50:56.012
My grandmother raised me. My grandmother.

50:56.095 --> 50:59.349
- No kidding?
- Yeah, she's the one that put the time in.

50:59.807 --> 51:03.144
The day-to-day, you know,
feeding, and you know.

51:03.228 --> 51:04.771
Sounds like a sweet woman.

51:04.854 --> 51:07.857
Sweet! The sweetest thing
you ever wanna meet.

51:09.817 --> 51:13.529
Angel. My grandmother's the first person
ever punched me in the face.

51:14.822 --> 51:18.451
None of that hard shit, a jab,
just to let me know she was serious.

51:18.952 --> 51:20.453
Parents don't take the time anymore.

51:20.536 --> 51:22.997
No, that's love, you know. I mean, only...

51:23.122 --> 51:26.000
You got to love somebody's baby
to punch a baby in the face.

51:26.251 --> 51:31.047
Kelly Robinson was just a scared little boy.
That's all. A scared little boy.

51:31.130 --> 51:32.757
Keep going. Keep digging.

51:32.924 --> 51:36.719
I mean, I put on a show, but inside, man,
lots of time I be crying.

51:43.351 --> 51:44.686
You ready for a bomb?

51:45.186 --> 51:46.396
Tell me.

51:46.604 --> 51:49.107
You and I are basically the same guy.

51:49.190 --> 51:52.277
Take away the boxing,
take away the money...

51:52.360 --> 51:53.528
Take away my money?

51:54.153 --> 51:55.697
It's a metaphor.

51:56.531 --> 51:59.117
Take away all your women.

51:59.742 --> 52:03.204
Take away all the trappings of success.

52:04.998 --> 52:06.749
And you and I are the same guy.

52:06.833 --> 52:10.545
- You know what I'm saying?
- Yeah, I know. I know. I'm you.

52:10.628 --> 52:13.548
- No, I'm you.
- Yeah, that's what I mean.

52:13.715 --> 52:16.050
We're... We're twins.

52:20.555 --> 52:23.266
Oh, I've got a crush on Rachel for years.

52:23.391 --> 52:25.560
I just love her power.

52:25.852 --> 52:28.604
And sexy and...
You saw the way she threw me over.

52:28.688 --> 52:31.316
It was just like I was nothing.
Just a powerful woman.

52:32.317 --> 52:34.485
You know what? I'll tell you what.

52:34.569 --> 52:36.070
If you feel that way about a girl.

52:36.487 --> 52:38.364
- Oh, I do.
- Then you got to act on it.

52:38.448 --> 52:40.992
You see how it is when
I try to talk to her.

52:41.075 --> 52:43.077
- No, man, you gotta...
- Fumbling over myself...

52:43.202 --> 52:45.330
I see, but you need to change that.

52:45.413 --> 52:47.040
Be honest with me. We're in the sewer.

52:47.123 --> 52:49.042
- Hey, I ain't gonna lie to you.
- What?

52:49.125 --> 52:52.962
I don't have the savoir faire,
that devilish charm.

52:53.046 --> 52:54.672
I've seen you, and I don't have that.

52:54.756 --> 52:56.174
I beg to differ. I disagree.

52:56.257 --> 52:59.344
No, I'm not gonna sit here
and listen to your...

52:59.427 --> 53:01.763
Bust it, bust it. You do have savoir faire.

53:02.013 --> 53:04.390
You just have to unleash it.

53:05.600 --> 53:09.771
Unleash it. Unleash your savoir faire.

53:11.814 --> 53:12.982
I don't know.

53:13.649 --> 53:18.196
You know, if you forget that this is a sewer,
it's kind of a beautiful place.

53:29.582 --> 53:32.627
Thank God! What happened?
I thought you two were dead.

53:32.835 --> 53:35.546
- Gundars' men had us pinned down.
- Did they see your faces?

53:35.671 --> 53:37.381
No, we're okay.
Have you been tracking the pen?

53:37.465 --> 53:39.717
Yeah, it never left the palace.
He moved around until 1:30,

53:39.801 --> 53:42.428
and it's been stationary in the bedroom
ever since. He's not onto us.

53:42.512 --> 53:45.348
Let us know, Jim,
the minute that pen moves.

53:45.431 --> 53:48.559
The plane is still in Budapest,
but the deal's going down today.

53:48.851 --> 53:50.436
Bob, get a helicopter in the air.

53:50.520 --> 53:53.940
I want you scanning every rooftop,
parking lot, playground in the city.

53:54.023 --> 53:56.484
UV, infrared,
throw everything you got at it.

53:56.567 --> 53:57.985
- Let's go.
- We're on it.

54:04.033 --> 54:05.326
Just zoom in on it.

54:05.409 --> 54:06.661
Rachel, you look bad.

54:09.247 --> 54:13.167
But not... Tired. You must be exhausted.

54:13.918 --> 54:15.169
What a night.

54:15.253 --> 54:17.338
I was driving around,
looking for you all night.

54:17.421 --> 54:19.006
Why don't you go in the back,
take a little nap?

54:19.090 --> 54:20.550
We'll give a yell if the pen moves.

54:20.967 --> 54:22.593
You sure you guys
can handle this without me?

54:22.760 --> 54:25.555
You've been working hard. I'm sure
he got this covered. Go take a little nap.

54:26.472 --> 54:29.100
All right, maybe I will for a sec,
but call me if anything happens.

54:31.102 --> 54:32.353
I'm glad you're okay.

54:32.520 --> 54:34.021
All right. Thank you.

54:36.357 --> 54:37.567
Oh, yeah.

54:39.277 --> 54:42.029
I know what you thinking,
and the answer is yes, playboy.

54:42.196 --> 54:45.241
- Oh, yes, it is. You going in there.
- I'm not going in there.

54:45.324 --> 54:47.368
Yes, you are going,
and you gonna be devilishly charming.

54:47.451 --> 54:51.372
- This isn't one of your floozies. That is a girl.
- A girl's a girl.

54:51.455 --> 54:53.791
She's special.
You gotta put her on a pedestal.

54:53.875 --> 54:55.877
Well, we don't have a pedestal.
All we got is a cot in the back.

54:58.379 --> 55:00.256
- I'll do it tomorrow.
- No, no, no, today.

55:00.339 --> 55:01.799
Right now, on the cot in the back.

55:02.884 --> 55:04.510
- I don't know.
- I do know.

55:04.760 --> 55:06.345
- Okay.
- Let's do it.

55:06.971 --> 55:08.931
I know you in a good mood now. Let's do it.

55:11.100 --> 55:14.020
You gonna be charming as hell.
I'm gonna show you how we gonna do it.

55:14.437 --> 55:16.522
I'm gonna unleash your savoir faire.

55:20.693 --> 55:22.153
Hey, it's me, Alex.

55:23.571 --> 55:24.906
Alex?

55:25.573 --> 55:26.949
I love the way you say my name.

55:27.033 --> 55:29.493
It's the way the L flicks off your tongue

55:29.577 --> 55:30.995
when you say the L in Alex.

55:31.078 --> 55:34.665
It's like the way the L
flicks off your tongue.

55:34.749 --> 55:37.668
It's like, "Alex, Alex, Alex."

55:37.752 --> 55:41.130
Say it one more time for me.
Just let me hear you say it.

55:42.089 --> 55:43.257
Alex, what are you doing?

55:46.552 --> 55:48.930
What am I doing? I'm just...

55:49.597 --> 55:52.808
I'll tell you what I'm doing. I'm getting
ready to make love to you so good and long

55:52.892 --> 55:55.937
you'll be begging me to stop
and keep going at the same time. Say that.

55:57.021 --> 55:58.397
I'll tell you what I'm doing.

55:59.690 --> 56:01.150
I'm getting ready to...

56:04.946 --> 56:07.865
Baby, I'm gonna make sure that you're okay.

56:07.949 --> 56:11.244
Now that I see that you are,
you're all tucked in, doing fine,

56:11.327 --> 56:14.205
I'm gonna go back out.
Everything's fine here. Don't worry about us.

56:14.288 --> 56:17.667
Go back to sleep. Don't...
Forget I came in. I'll just...

56:18.376 --> 56:21.712
That's not what I said.
Hey! Get back in there!

56:22.505 --> 56:24.632
No! Your rap's not working.

56:25.299 --> 56:27.969
We'll try tomorrow. We did our best.
There's no shame in that.

56:28.135 --> 56:31.389
Kelly Robinson's rap works! Get your ass
back in there. This is good shit.

56:33.391 --> 56:34.600
Give me...

56:34.767 --> 56:39.063
Hey, I'm just... I'm sorry
to keep barging in like this.

56:39.188 --> 56:40.523
I just wanna...

56:40.815 --> 56:43.985
Let me just take a...
Just collect myself for a second.

56:44.277 --> 56:47.405
I have something that I want to say,
and if you don't mind...

56:47.488 --> 56:49.156
I just have a...

56:49.657 --> 56:51.909
It's almost like a story
that I feel I need to tell you.

56:51.993 --> 56:54.453
That's good.
I'm gonna give you my secret weapon.

56:54.870 --> 56:56.747
<i>This shit always works. Now listen, now.</i>

56:56.831 --> 56:58.165
Look in her eyes.

57:01.002 --> 57:02.128
Now sing...

57:02.211 --> 57:06.590
<i>Baby, I woke up this morning</i>

57:07.174 --> 57:09.260
<i>A sea was storming inside of me</i>

57:09.343 --> 57:10.386
Say that.

57:10.886 --> 57:12.596
Baby, when I woke up this morning,

57:12.680 --> 57:15.558
I felt like there was a sea
storming inside of me.

57:15.891 --> 57:16.976
<i>Inside of me</i>

57:17.059 --> 57:18.102
Inside of me.

57:18.185 --> 57:21.814
<i>And baby, I think I'm capsizing</i>

57:21.897 --> 57:24.525
<i>The waves are rising and rising</i>

57:25.192 --> 57:27.320
And baby,

57:27.403 --> 57:30.197
I think I'm capsizing.

57:30.740 --> 57:34.535
I think I'm capsizing,
and the waves just keep rising.

57:34.702 --> 57:35.703
<i>Rising</i>

57:35.828 --> 57:36.829
Rising.

57:36.912 --> 57:37.913
<i>And rising</i>

57:37.997 --> 57:38.956
Rising and...

57:42.293 --> 57:46.255
<i>And when I get that feeling
I need sexual healing</i>

57:46.464 --> 57:48.174
When I get that feeling,

57:48.966 --> 57:53.846
I need sexual healing.

57:54.138 --> 57:55.181
I just need it. I just need it.

57:55.264 --> 57:58.142
Sexual... I know, it sounds crazy.
I'm just...

57:58.225 --> 58:02.980
I'm probably delirious,
but it just makes me feel so fine.

58:03.230 --> 58:04.607
<i>And it's good for us</i>

58:04.982 --> 58:06.400
And it's good for us.

58:06.650 --> 58:09.904
<i>Sexual healing, baby</i>

58:10.404 --> 58:13.908
It's sexual. It's healing. Okay?

58:15.117 --> 58:16.994
I don't know what else I can say.

58:17.244 --> 58:18.704
You're cute.

58:19.789 --> 58:21.457
I've always had a little crush on you.

58:21.957 --> 58:24.085
- I told you!
- Really? You did?

58:25.753 --> 58:28.714
- I'm hot. It's hot in here, isn't it?
- Oh, my gosh.

58:28.798 --> 58:30.633
Good Lord.

58:32.551 --> 58:34.762
Shit, yeah, that's what I'm talking about.

58:36.055 --> 58:39.100
Now go over there,
and bite her on the ass real hard.

58:39.433 --> 58:40.726
- No!
- Yes!

58:40.851 --> 58:42.770
- No, no, no, no.
- No?

58:42.895 --> 58:44.939
No, no, no, no. Yes to you.

58:45.022 --> 58:46.524
- Yes?
- Bite her. Bite her!

58:46.607 --> 58:47.775
- No!
- No?

58:47.858 --> 58:50.236
No, yes. Go back to where you were.

58:50.319 --> 58:53.364
- I'm just... I'm...
- Bite! Bite! Bite her!

58:54.281 --> 58:55.449
They love that shit.

58:55.533 --> 58:59.453
Don't break the skin, but bite it good,
you know, so that there's a mark on her ass.

58:59.537 --> 59:02.665
She'll show all her friends.
"Look at my mark, what he did."

59:05.209 --> 59:06.836
I know what you want.

59:11.465 --> 59:13.884
It's okay. You can trust me.

59:14.593 --> 59:16.387
Ow! Oh!

59:21.308 --> 59:23.561
- Oh, my...
- You okay?

59:23.644 --> 59:25.688
I think you broke my spine.

59:28.441 --> 59:29.859
But in a good way.

59:37.950 --> 59:39.201
Hey!

59:40.035 --> 59:41.579
Hey, come on, now.

59:41.662 --> 59:43.372
Let me at least see the goods.

59:46.167 --> 59:48.586
Hey, the pen just moved! Let's go!

59:48.669 --> 59:50.754
Let's move! Gotta go! Let's go!

59:51.380 --> 59:52.673
- Pen moved.
- No, no, no.

59:52.882 --> 59:54.592
- I don't... Are you sure?
- Come on. Yes.

01:00:02.516 --> 01:00:05.102
It looks like he's out of the car
and headed for the baths.

01:00:05.853 --> 01:00:07.688
Wait. Why is he going to the baths?

01:00:07.771 --> 01:00:10.024
As long as he's not going
to a pen store, who cares?

01:00:10.691 --> 01:00:13.235
Stakeout. Stakeout. Stakeout, guys.

01:00:13.444 --> 01:00:14.778
This needs a stakeout.

01:00:29.627 --> 01:00:32.755
- I'll take the back, okay?
- Wait a second, Rachel. Be careful.

01:00:34.256 --> 01:00:35.549
You too, okay?

01:00:39.053 --> 01:00:41.472
Please. Come on, man. Come on.

01:00:41.805 --> 01:00:45.059
You realize I can save the world
and make boxing history in one day?

01:00:45.309 --> 01:00:47.102
- All right.
- They'll give me a parade.

01:00:47.520 --> 01:00:50.189
Ticker-tape parade.
Confetti and all that shit.

01:00:50.272 --> 01:00:52.399
Bigass parade. Glitter.

01:00:52.608 --> 01:00:53.692
Get my own day.

01:00:55.277 --> 01:00:58.489
Kelly Day.
Kelly Robinson Day parade.

01:00:59.907 --> 01:01:01.450
Nasty as hell up in here.

01:01:02.034 --> 01:01:04.411
It smells like ass soup all over the place.

01:01:04.954 --> 01:01:06.997
- I just lost the signal.
- What?

01:01:07.289 --> 01:01:09.583
What's the problem?
Maybe the walls are too thick in here.

01:01:10.251 --> 01:01:12.503
No, no. Something's wrong. Come on.

01:01:12.586 --> 01:01:15.714
We can't walk away from this.
We got to get that plane!

01:01:15.798 --> 01:01:19.051
You're fired up today.
I like your enthusiasm, I don't wanna lose it.

01:01:19.134 --> 01:01:21.011
But sometimes when you're a spy,
you move forward,

01:01:21.095 --> 01:01:22.805
sometimes back. We're moving back.

01:01:22.888 --> 01:01:24.390
Hell, no! Listen to me.

01:01:24.473 --> 01:01:27.059
I told you I was semipsychic.
I got a hunch on this.

01:01:27.268 --> 01:01:30.145
Seven out of 10 of my hunches are correct.
That's a high ratio!

01:01:30.229 --> 01:01:33.190
We got to go with them numbers.
Like, here, in this area,

01:01:33.691 --> 01:01:36.610
I'm vibing this. Right now,
I know the plane is in here.

01:01:36.860 --> 01:01:38.195
Trust me on this. Hey!

01:01:38.612 --> 01:01:40.322
What you know about the Leafy Bug, sissy?

01:01:40.656 --> 01:01:42.700
What?

01:01:43.617 --> 01:01:47.288
- Kick your ass if I find it in here.
- Kelly, Kelly, Kelly.

01:01:47.871 --> 01:01:50.165
Hell, yeah. Come on, now.
You don't feel that?

01:01:50.374 --> 01:01:53.627
There's nothing in here.
You must be crazy. I feel something.

01:01:53.794 --> 01:01:55.796
Just a lot of old guys hitting
each other with sticks.

01:01:55.921 --> 01:01:57.965
There's something else. I feel it.

01:01:58.632 --> 01:02:01.677
Something's going on in here.
Something's definitely going on.

01:02:01.844 --> 01:02:03.304
What's your name, boy?

01:02:04.471 --> 01:02:07.474
He talking all that ibbidy-bibbidy shit
because he knows something.

01:02:07.558 --> 01:02:09.184
I tell you, something's in here. I feel it.

01:02:09.310 --> 01:02:11.979
You know what we learned?
We learned we can't trust your gut.

01:02:12.146 --> 01:02:13.772
You can trust my gut. I told you...

01:02:13.981 --> 01:02:16.859
Maybe the plane's over there
in the whirlpool. Maybe we should check...

01:02:16.942 --> 01:02:18.360
Maybe three out of 10...

01:02:19.153 --> 01:02:20.321
Gun!

01:02:29.830 --> 01:02:32.708
- You said you knew there was a plane!
- I said, a vibe! A vibe!

01:02:33.125 --> 01:02:34.501
Like a fool, I listened!

01:02:39.381 --> 01:02:40.799
You got a sure way out of here?

01:02:41.133 --> 01:02:43.844
I followed you in here.
Why would I have a way out?

01:02:49.516 --> 01:02:51.727
- What are you shooting at?
- Trying to hit the pipes.

01:02:54.521 --> 01:02:57.691
Throw this up there.
We'll create a spark. When I say ready. Go!

01:03:01.278 --> 01:03:02.571
I got it. I got it.

01:03:04.698 --> 01:03:06.200
It's gonna blow. It's gonna blow!

01:03:24.635 --> 01:03:25.719
We gotta warn Rachel.

01:03:40.067 --> 01:03:41.151
There goes Gundars!

01:03:42.027 --> 01:03:43.112
Rachel!

01:03:44.238 --> 01:03:45.364
Rachel, no!

01:03:45.572 --> 01:03:46.949
It's a setup!

01:03:51.078 --> 01:03:52.496
No! No!

01:03:59.962 --> 01:04:01.004
Oh, man!

01:04:06.427 --> 01:04:07.678
Let's go.

01:04:09.430 --> 01:04:12.599
- That's it?
- Yeah, Kelly, that's it.

01:04:15.811 --> 01:04:16.979
Shit!

01:04:20.107 --> 01:04:21.608
- Are you all right?
- What do you think?

01:04:21.859 --> 01:04:24.153
I think you're messed up,
and you need to talk.

01:04:24.445 --> 01:04:26.280
Is that what you think?
Rachel's dead!

01:04:26.447 --> 01:04:28.615
She's dead because I've been
listening to you. I'm done.

01:04:28.991 --> 01:04:31.201
I know you're upset.
Rachel was a good woman.

01:04:31.285 --> 01:04:34.163
She was a good woman, and she's gone.

01:04:34.246 --> 01:04:36.206
You're still here, though, semipsychic guy.

01:04:36.290 --> 01:04:38.834
Wait. You ain't blaming
that back there on me.

01:04:39.042 --> 01:04:41.837
Of course not. Who could blame you?
It's not your fault.

01:04:41.920 --> 01:04:44.798
You're the king of the universe.
You just want Kelly Robinson Day.

01:04:44.882 --> 01:04:47.926
- Have the parade. You'll get it.
- Hey, slow it down. Back off.

01:04:48.010 --> 01:04:50.053
I don't like your tone.
You fixing to get your ass whipped.

01:04:50.137 --> 01:04:52.222
Really? Is that one of your hunches?

01:04:52.514 --> 01:04:54.767
Or just some of the normal crap
that comes out of your mouth?

01:04:55.058 --> 01:04:57.478
Remember what I said in the sewer
about how we're the same guy?

01:04:57.644 --> 01:04:59.813
I'm not you. Thank God, I'm not you!

01:04:59.897 --> 01:05:02.149
- I would hate to be you.
- All right.

01:05:02.691 --> 01:05:05.360
That's the last straw.
I got to whup your ass now.

01:05:05.819 --> 01:05:07.988
- You wanna fight me?
- Ain't gonna be no fight, I'll whip your ass!

01:05:08.071 --> 01:05:09.656
- Let me take off my jacket.
- Take it off.

01:05:09.823 --> 01:05:10.783
This is gonna amuse me.

01:05:10.866 --> 01:05:13.702
If going to the dentist is amusing,
then this is getting ready to be funny.

01:05:13.827 --> 01:05:16.622
This ain't a boxing ring,
there's no ref. I don't need no referee.

01:05:16.705 --> 01:05:19.833
From this position, I know about 11 ways
I can totally immobilize you.

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:21.543
End your life right... Ah!

01:05:21.627 --> 01:05:23.545
How much from that position? Huh?

01:05:23.879 --> 01:05:24.922
That was my left hand.

01:05:25.005 --> 01:05:27.674
If I hit you with my right hand,
you'd be drinking meat through a straw.

01:05:30.511 --> 01:05:32.054
Will you look at Surfer Boy!

01:05:32.387 --> 01:05:33.847
Show me some good spy shit.

01:05:33.931 --> 01:05:35.182
Hey, shit!

01:05:36.850 --> 01:05:40.187
If I'd gone 6 inches higher,
you'd be in a coma right now.

01:05:42.022 --> 01:05:43.190
You okay?

01:05:43.357 --> 01:05:47.152
You know how to use your feet good.
Throw kicks like a little bitch!

01:05:54.034 --> 01:05:55.035
You got me!

01:06:02.125 --> 01:06:04.127
I'd like to file a complaint! Wait!

01:06:04.211 --> 01:06:06.630
Why am I being arrested?
Why am I being arrested?

01:06:06.713 --> 01:06:09.466
This is bullshit! He kicked me first!
He kicked me in my nuts!

01:06:11.176 --> 01:06:14.221
Why am I getting arrested
if I got kicked in my nuts?

01:06:14.304 --> 01:06:17.432
How come you just arresting the black man?
My nuts was kicked!

01:06:58.807 --> 01:06:59.933
- Yeah?
<i>- Alex.</i>

01:07:00.017 --> 01:07:02.394
Where the hell are you?
I've been calling for three hours!

01:07:02.561 --> 01:07:04.521
I know. We hit a few snags.

01:07:04.980 --> 01:07:07.858
<i>Snags? I'm sending backup now.
What's your location?</i>

01:07:07.941 --> 01:07:09.109
- No, it's all fine.
<i>- It's all fine?</i>

01:07:09.735 --> 01:07:13.530
I'm headed to the castle tonight.
I'll try to track Gundars to the plane.

01:07:13.614 --> 01:07:17.409
<i>You don't know where it is yet?
I knew you'd screw this up. Look...</i>

01:07:17.492 --> 01:07:19.411
I gotta go, Mac. I gotta go.

01:07:28.962 --> 01:07:30.505
I'm telling you, dude never been this late.

01:07:30.839 --> 01:07:32.758
The brother can't tell time no more.
That's the problem.

01:07:32.925 --> 01:07:36.386
- Kelly! Where you been?
- Better yet, who you been with?

01:07:36.470 --> 01:07:39.306
If you hang with us instead of Rain Man,
this shit wouldn't happen.

01:07:39.389 --> 01:07:41.808
He ain't our problem no more.
Let's go down here and get 58.

01:08:10.504 --> 01:08:13.298
Piece of shit microtracker.

01:08:14.007 --> 01:08:16.009
You're a very lucky
man, Mr. Zhu Tam.

01:08:16.093 --> 01:08:18.095
I feel like I just
won the lottery.

01:08:18.303 --> 01:08:22.099
It's funny, isn't it?
You winning makes me rich.

01:08:23.100 --> 01:08:26.853
My government's point of view
is that no price is too high.

01:08:28.063 --> 01:08:29.314
Clearly.

01:08:31.524 --> 01:08:33.193
So how's your golf game?

01:08:33.359 --> 01:08:35.612
I haven't had much time
since I've been here.

01:08:50.877 --> 01:08:52.796
In the 15th hole. Eagle.

01:08:52.879 --> 01:08:54.548
- First time ever.
- Really?

01:09:25.662 --> 01:09:27.038
This is it, baby.

01:09:29.750 --> 01:09:32.836
Driver, take the car off the bridge,
away from the traffic.

01:09:33.377 --> 01:09:34.587
I don't see it.

01:09:34.671 --> 01:09:37.591
That's the whole point, isn't it?
That you can't see it.

01:09:38.008 --> 01:09:40.218
- That's what you're buying, isn't it?
- That's true.

01:10:02.657 --> 01:10:03.784
Thank you.

01:10:07.162 --> 01:10:09.539
Wait a second. Come on.

01:10:11.166 --> 01:10:12.626
Is that...

01:10:14.169 --> 01:10:16.421
Please. Finally!

01:10:17.714 --> 01:10:18.924
Well.

01:10:19.007 --> 01:10:21.134
Now perhaps
you'll believe me when I tell you

01:10:21.301 --> 01:10:24.054
that you've driven past it
at least half a dozen times.

01:10:52.332 --> 01:10:54.334
It is the most incredible thing
I have ever seen.

01:10:55.669 --> 01:10:57.671
Shall we conclude our business?

01:11:00.173 --> 01:11:01.925
Gentlemen, to the center of the ring.

01:11:02.384 --> 01:11:04.845
I explained the instructions
in the dressing room.

01:11:05.512 --> 01:11:07.097
You're both professional fighters.

01:11:07.222 --> 01:11:09.641
I expect you to conduct
yourself professionally.

01:11:10.308 --> 01:11:12.102
- Shake hands.
- You ready to do this?

01:11:12.185 --> 01:11:13.395
Let's do it.

01:11:20.277 --> 01:11:23.029
It looks like my computer
is a billion dollars healthier.

01:11:23.196 --> 01:11:24.865
Which makes you the proud owner

01:11:24.948 --> 01:11:27.993
of the most advanced piece
of weaponry on the planet.

01:11:29.661 --> 01:11:30.745
Watch this.

01:11:36.668 --> 01:11:38.253
The ignition code.

01:11:48.096 --> 01:11:51.600
Round one for the super middleweight
championship of the world!

01:11:51.892 --> 01:11:52.893
Okay, Cedric, come on.

01:11:53.310 --> 01:11:55.729
What side do you want the swelling on?
Left or right?

01:11:57.397 --> 01:11:59.191
<i>Mills goes right to work.</i>

01:12:02.611 --> 01:12:03.778
Left hand up! Left hand up!

01:12:04.696 --> 01:12:05.822
<i>He's spun around by...</i>

01:12:50.367 --> 01:12:53.036
That looks like an old-fashioned
thermonuclear warhead.

01:12:53.286 --> 01:12:54.913
It's a bit primitive, isn't it?

01:12:54.996 --> 01:12:56.456
They won't think so in Washington.

01:13:13.223 --> 01:13:14.933
Tell your men to drop their guns.

01:13:15.100 --> 01:13:17.519
- Tell them!
- Do as he says.

01:13:17.936 --> 01:13:19.271
Get your hands up!

01:13:19.562 --> 01:13:20.855
You too, Mr. Zhu Tam.

01:13:21.773 --> 01:13:23.316
Do it!

01:13:27.988 --> 01:13:29.990
You didn't think you could fool BNS,
did you?

01:13:32.867 --> 01:13:34.911
- Rachel?
- I guess we did, Alex.

01:13:35.245 --> 01:13:36.496
You're alive.

01:13:37.122 --> 01:13:38.373
Don't tell anyone.

01:13:40.125 --> 01:13:42.961
<i>Robinson having his way.
Combination to the head.</i>

01:13:43.378 --> 01:13:46.381
And a left hook jars the challenger.

01:13:47.465 --> 01:13:50.010
<i>Here comes Robinson, and here comes Mills.</i>

01:13:50.719 --> 01:13:52.762
<i>Body shots by the challenger, Mills.</i>

01:13:52.846 --> 01:13:55.557
<i>Holding on to him. Tying the champion up.</i>

01:13:58.184 --> 01:14:00.520
That was pretty convincing.
The whole "I'm dead" thing.

01:14:01.313 --> 01:14:02.981
You pick up a few tricks over the years.

01:14:03.148 --> 01:14:06.276
- You certainly do.
- You really should have caught it.

01:14:06.443 --> 01:14:07.944
Yeah, I should have.

01:14:08.570 --> 01:14:11.531
I guess I was a little distracted
by the sound of my heart breaking.

01:14:13.867 --> 01:14:15.201
<i>Code invalid.</i>

01:14:16.578 --> 01:14:18.997
That's not good. Is that good?

01:14:20.290 --> 01:14:21.458
What the hell did you do?

01:14:21.541 --> 01:14:23.293
I entered the ignition code. That's all.

01:14:23.460 --> 01:14:25.712
<i>Self-destruct sequence activated.</i>

01:14:26.046 --> 01:14:28.631
The plane must have a self-destruct
mechanism if the wrong code is entered.

01:14:28.715 --> 01:14:33.428
No, that is the correct code.
I saw Lieutenant Percy fire the engine myself.

01:14:33.595 --> 01:14:37.223
Just get it handled, Agent Wright.
That's what you're paid to do.

01:14:41.227 --> 01:14:43.021
He ain't done nothing to earn your respect!

01:14:43.104 --> 01:14:45.440
It's number 58 going down right now.
You hear?

01:14:45.607 --> 01:14:46.900
- How you feeling?
- 58.

01:14:47.067 --> 01:14:48.693
- You good?
- Good, yeah.

01:14:49.736 --> 01:14:51.613
Damn! She may wanna braid that.

01:14:53.948 --> 01:14:56.534
<i>And this world championship fight rages on.</i>

01:14:56.743 --> 01:14:58.161
The code times out?

01:14:58.244 --> 01:15:01.247
What, like a safety precaution?
In case the plane were stolen or something?

01:15:02.749 --> 01:15:06.211
Washington sent you to fly the plane home.
I assume you know the correct code.

01:15:06.294 --> 01:15:09.547
Careful with assumptions, that has a way
of coming back and kicking you in your ass.

01:15:11.257 --> 01:15:14.094
<i>Robinson measuring Mills up.</i>

01:15:16.971 --> 01:15:18.973
<i>A wicked left hook by Robinson.</i>

01:15:19.891 --> 01:15:22.519
- How much is Gundars paying you?
- I don't have time for this.

01:15:22.602 --> 01:15:24.979
If I'd known you were for sale,
I would have put in a bid myself...

01:15:26.981 --> 01:15:28.358
I know that hurt.

01:15:28.525 --> 01:15:30.944
You got a hard-ass head. Damn!

01:15:31.111 --> 01:15:32.278
The code, Alex.

01:15:37.325 --> 01:15:38.451
Come on, Cedric.

01:15:40.203 --> 01:15:42.789
Robinson dancing around.
What's going on here?

01:15:42.956 --> 01:15:45.500
<i>It looks like he's fighting
an invisible opponent.</i>

01:15:52.048 --> 01:15:56.219
<i>And down goes Robinson! Unbelievable!</i>

01:15:56.386 --> 01:15:59.264
Rachel, you're not getting
this plane off the bridge.

01:16:00.640 --> 01:16:02.392
Five. Six...

01:16:03.560 --> 01:16:06.521
<i>Kelly Robinson is down for
the first time in his career!</i>

01:16:06.646 --> 01:16:08.440
- Can you continue?
- I'm okay.

01:16:08.606 --> 01:16:09.607
- Let's go.
- All right.

01:16:09.774 --> 01:16:10.984
Let's go. Fight!

01:16:13.862 --> 01:16:15.822
Now it's gonna get messy.

01:16:22.412 --> 01:16:24.038
It's time to go down.

01:16:27.167 --> 01:16:29.002
<i>And Mills is down!</i>

01:16:29.169 --> 01:16:32.172
- Now we're talking!
- Five.

01:16:32.297 --> 01:16:33.840
- Come on, come on!
- Six.

01:16:34.883 --> 01:16:38.178
Seven. Eight. Nine.

01:16:38.303 --> 01:16:40.680
<i>- He's not gonna make it.</i>
- Ten! You're out!

01:16:40.847 --> 01:16:43.433
<i>It's over!
Kelly Robinson is still</i>

01:16:43.600 --> 01:16:45.810
<i>the super middleweight champion
of the world!</i>

01:16:49.355 --> 01:16:52.609
<i>Robinson foregoing his usual
flamboyant victory lap.</i>

01:16:52.775 --> 01:16:54.694
<i>He bolts the ring.</i>

01:16:54.903 --> 01:16:57.530
I'm impressed, Alex.
You're tougher than I thought.

01:16:58.198 --> 01:17:00.700
There's one thing that
will always make a man talk.

01:17:07.123 --> 01:17:08.333
Cutting my belt?

01:17:18.468 --> 01:17:21.554
- Take off his pants.
- Take off my pants?

01:17:21.721 --> 01:17:23.389
Hold it. Wait a second.

01:17:35.902 --> 01:17:38.196
Easy. Easy. Come on, take it easy.

01:17:53.211 --> 01:17:55.797
- What are you doing here?
- You turned on the eye thing,

01:17:55.880 --> 01:17:57.757
- so I had to come save your ass!
- I did?

01:18:00.593 --> 01:18:03.972
That's a huge gesture!
That must mean you really love me.

01:18:04.138 --> 01:18:06.015
Don't get this twisted.
I did this to secure my parade.

01:18:06.182 --> 01:18:08.851
- No getting around it. You love me.
- This is for the parade!

01:18:09.018 --> 01:18:10.103
- It's love!
- Parade!

01:18:10.186 --> 01:18:11.437
- It's love!
- Parade!

01:18:11.646 --> 01:18:13.856
- Kelly Robinson Day parade!
- Move!

01:18:18.319 --> 01:18:19.904
I'm starting to regret this shit!

01:18:20.780 --> 01:18:22.198
Move! Move!

01:18:26.077 --> 01:18:28.288
Cover me! Go!

01:18:51.811 --> 01:18:53.313
Hold your fire! Hold your fire!

01:18:56.149 --> 01:18:57.358
Who the hell is this guy?

01:18:57.942 --> 01:19:00.778
It's Carlos. I guess Mac
sent him in as backup for us.

01:19:01.279 --> 01:19:02.655
He's like a superspy.

01:19:02.739 --> 01:19:04.574
He's a spy, the same as me. Not a superspy.

01:19:04.657 --> 01:19:07.035
He got a fly-ass ninja
outfit and parachute.

01:19:07.201 --> 01:19:09.495
We hanging from balloons and shit.

01:19:09.746 --> 01:19:12.582
Gundars! Tell your men
to put down their weapons.

01:19:12.749 --> 01:19:14.834
It seems to be quite a trend tonight. Down!

01:19:15.001 --> 01:19:17.629
Alex, the code,
before we all blow up.

01:19:17.795 --> 01:19:20.840
That's what I'm doing.
I was on my way to do it.

01:19:20.923 --> 01:19:22.592
Doing fine before you got here.

01:19:22.800 --> 01:19:24.594
Mr. Zhu Tam, I believe.

01:19:24.886 --> 01:19:26.137
Carlos, careful. Rachel's a double agent!

01:19:26.220 --> 01:19:28.681
Yes, I know, Alex.

01:19:30.391 --> 01:19:32.518
Yours too, Rachel.

01:19:37.023 --> 01:19:38.650
Apparently, you've been a bad girl.

01:19:43.863 --> 01:19:46.866
Now hold up. Wait a second. Hey, Alex,

01:19:47.200 --> 01:19:49.577
- this James Bond dude is with Rachel.
- Not now.

01:19:49.911 --> 01:19:52.705
I got a hunch. This guy is bad.
I can feel it right now.

01:19:52.872 --> 01:19:54.874
I said, not now. Let me figure this out!

01:19:55.041 --> 01:19:56.793
How did big shot know she was bad?

01:19:56.959 --> 01:19:59.962
I got 45 seconds to figure out
this logarithmic code,

01:20:00.129 --> 01:20:02.382
or we'll all die because we'll blow up.

01:20:02.548 --> 01:20:06.052
Why don't you stick to your perfume ads
and leave the espionage to me?

01:20:06.511 --> 01:20:07.804
No, don't say that to him.

01:20:08.388 --> 01:20:11.224
Hey, Zorro, it's not perfume. It's cologne.

01:20:11.557 --> 01:20:13.101
No, Kelly! No!

01:20:25.196 --> 01:20:27.031
Come on, come on. Here we go.

01:20:27.115 --> 01:20:29.117
<i>- Code invalid.</i>
- Come on.

01:20:29.200 --> 01:20:30.868
<i>Eighteen, seventeen,</i>

01:20:31.577 --> 01:20:32.620
<i>sixteen...</i>

01:20:35.748 --> 01:20:36.833
<i>Thirteen,</i>

01:20:36.916 --> 01:20:38.209
<i>twelve,</i>

01:20:38.292 --> 01:20:40.002
<i>eleven...</i>

01:20:43.923 --> 01:20:48.261
<i>Nine, eight, seven. Sequence aborted.</i>

01:20:48.886 --> 01:20:50.012
I got it. I got it.

01:20:50.138 --> 01:20:52.265
No, I don't. No, I don't. No, I don't.

01:20:57.603 --> 01:21:00.606
Don't do it! Put that shit down.
Put the gun down right now.

01:21:01.107 --> 01:21:03.568
I'm putting it down. Okay?

01:21:04.610 --> 01:21:07.071
But I'm on your side. I'm with BNS.

01:21:07.280 --> 01:21:10.199
What do BNS stand for with you?
Bitch that Need some Slapping?

01:21:10.283 --> 01:21:12.577
I was just trying to make sure
Carlos doesn't get to this computer.

01:21:12.660 --> 01:21:15.747
Think I believe that shit?
What's wrong with you?

01:21:16.122 --> 01:21:19.584
- Hear her trying to flip the script?
- Now she's saying she's good?

01:21:19.751 --> 01:21:22.170
I gotta hear this. This should be rich.

01:21:22.336 --> 01:21:24.922
We've suspected Carlos
was dirty for months.

01:21:25.047 --> 01:21:27.633
Mac and me teamed up with him
so we could nail him.

01:21:27.800 --> 01:21:31.095
- Why didn't they tell me?
- You know how this stuff works.

01:21:31.220 --> 01:21:33.723
It's all on a need-to-know basis.
You know that.

01:21:33.806 --> 01:21:36.642
Mac didn't want you protecting me
at the wrong time.

01:21:36.726 --> 01:21:39.771
That's all Carlos would have needed.
He's so insanely jealous of us.

01:21:39.937 --> 01:21:41.856
- He is?
- If he knew how we felt...

01:21:41.939 --> 01:21:44.525
Go easy now.
Don't be creeping up and shit.

01:21:44.609 --> 01:21:46.778
She got long legs.
Bitch is sneaky. She'll kick you.

01:21:47.320 --> 01:21:49.322
He's always known
I wanted to work with you.

01:21:49.489 --> 01:21:51.491
- You wanted to work with me?
- Yeah.

01:21:51.657 --> 01:21:53.326
What, like on a stakeout?

01:21:55.203 --> 01:21:56.913
Don't you know how I feel about you?

01:21:58.164 --> 01:22:01.334
- That's bullshit.
- My head's spinning. I don't know...

01:22:01.501 --> 01:22:02.960
I can't deny it. I feel the same...

01:22:03.044 --> 01:22:04.837
You dizzy from massive blood loss

01:22:05.004 --> 01:22:07.673
because the bitch stabbed you
15 minutes ago!

01:22:07.840 --> 01:22:10.676
I could have crippled him
for life if I wanted to.

01:22:10.843 --> 01:22:14.639
- You've got full mobility in your leg, right?
- It doesn't feel that bad.

01:22:14.806 --> 01:22:16.265
Son of a gun.

01:22:17.850 --> 01:22:21.479
I had no idea. Carlos was jealous of us?

01:22:21.562 --> 01:22:23.689
That's enough. I can't listen to this shit.

01:22:23.898 --> 01:22:26.984
What's wrong with you?
You booty-blinded right now.

01:22:27.068 --> 01:22:30.613
It's like being snow-blinded,
only it ain't no snow, just a cute piece of ass.

01:22:30.696 --> 01:22:33.074
No. She's telling the truth.

01:22:33.366 --> 01:22:35.910
You don't understand the spy world.
There are agents.

01:22:36.077 --> 01:22:39.038
There are double agents,
and there are pseudo-double agents.

01:22:39.205 --> 01:22:41.332
It's actually pretty standard stuff.

01:22:41.457 --> 01:22:43.209
Y'all stabbing each other is standard?

01:22:43.876 --> 01:22:45.878
Yeah. It's pretty standard.

01:22:46.671 --> 01:22:48.047
Look out!

01:23:00.893 --> 01:23:02.061
I'm watching your ass.

01:23:03.729 --> 01:23:05.857
Alex, you idiot! I'm on your side!

01:23:06.691 --> 01:23:07.984
I've had enough of this!

01:23:17.118 --> 01:23:19.328
There's Vitalis and shit all over...

01:23:19.495 --> 01:23:23.833
He was coming like a buzz saw.
If you didn't grab him, he was gonna kill me.

01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:26.627
It was like looking in
the eyes of the devil.

01:23:27.753 --> 01:23:29.255
Where's Rachel?

01:23:30.214 --> 01:23:32.592
Yeah, where is Rachel, huh? She gone.

01:23:33.009 --> 01:23:35.177
Didn't I tell you that bitch was bad?

01:23:35.344 --> 01:23:37.346
Why didn't you keep an eye on her?

01:23:37.430 --> 01:23:40.141
- You said she was good!
- You can't listen to what I say.

01:23:40.224 --> 01:23:42.852
I'm bleeding from a knife wound.
I'm delusional!

01:23:43.019 --> 01:23:45.771
You said yourself I'm booty-blind.
I'm blinded by ass.

01:23:45.938 --> 01:23:47.607
You blinded now, but a minute ago...

01:23:47.773 --> 01:23:51.944
You two fools just let Rachel escape
with Gundars' computer?

01:23:52.028 --> 01:23:55.031
That has all the passwords
to his numbered accounts.

01:23:55.114 --> 01:23:59.201
It's worth billions of dollars!
Mac knew you would screw this up.

01:23:59.452 --> 01:24:00.786
That's why he sent me...

01:24:02.413 --> 01:24:04.707
"Worth billions of dollars."
You hear this guy?

01:24:05.791 --> 01:24:07.043
He's still a bad guy, right?

01:24:08.836 --> 01:24:11.130
Yeah, he... Well, I don't know.

01:24:11.297 --> 01:24:14.300
Everybody keeps flip-flopping around.
I can't keep it straight.

01:24:14.467 --> 01:24:15.801
It's murky.

01:24:15.968 --> 01:24:18.554
- You said it was standard...
- I know what I said!

01:24:18.721 --> 01:24:21.682
It's murky when there ain't
no girl involved, huh?

01:24:22.266 --> 01:24:23.559
I see how it go.

01:24:23.726 --> 01:24:26.479
I'll tell you one thing.
Good or bad, I'm tying this guy up.

01:24:27.063 --> 01:24:29.315
We tie everybody up. That's the new rule.

01:24:29.649 --> 01:24:32.193
Why don't you stop stressing?
There's the Leafy Bug, baby.

01:24:32.944 --> 01:24:35.071
That's what we set out to
do, and we got it.

01:24:35.196 --> 01:24:36.864
We got the plane. We heroes.

01:24:36.989 --> 01:24:39.158
- You're right. Let's go home.
- Look at that.

01:24:39.325 --> 01:24:41.661
- You wanna see something cool?
- What?

01:24:47.333 --> 01:24:49.752
Man, that is some superfly, superspy shit!

01:24:49.919 --> 01:24:51.337
Let me see. What you pressing?

01:24:51.504 --> 01:24:53.547
- Just press that button.
- Okay.

01:24:54.799 --> 01:24:56.050
Invisible. Invisible.

01:24:56.217 --> 01:24:59.220
Gotta get that on my cars. You know
how clean my garage is gonna look?

01:24:59.387 --> 01:25:01.973
Visible. Invisible. Visible...

01:25:02.139 --> 01:25:04.600
- Careful, don't wear out the battery.
- Let me have some fun.

01:25:04.767 --> 01:25:07.186
It loses its specialness
after a while. Give it back.

01:25:07.353 --> 01:25:08.562
Come on, why you acting...

01:25:09.355 --> 01:25:12.233
Why you gotta be tripping?
Why can't I play with it?

01:25:12.400 --> 01:25:16.195
- You broke it.
- I broke the shit? How I break it?

01:25:16.612 --> 01:25:19.281
Like a child, you knock it
out of my hand. I broke it?

01:25:19.448 --> 01:25:21.200
Are you happy now? How will I explain this?

01:25:21.325 --> 01:25:24.120
I show up with the plane
and a broken remote.

01:25:24.286 --> 01:25:25.871
You think they're worried about the remote?

01:25:26.038 --> 01:25:28.916
There's dead bodies all over the roof.
You think they'll care about that?

01:25:29.083 --> 01:25:31.043
- Come on, man!
- You're right. Let's go.

01:25:31.210 --> 01:25:33.421
- We're heroes.
- I'm gonna get my parade, huh?

01:25:33.587 --> 01:25:36.549
- Maybe so.
- I'll definitely get a parade behind this.

01:25:38.551 --> 01:25:41.846
All right. Settle back,
and I'm gonna fire this baby up.

01:25:43.014 --> 01:25:45.641
And that is why they
call it the Switchblade.

01:25:52.857 --> 01:25:55.067
All right. Ready for the ride of your life?

01:25:55.234 --> 01:25:56.652
Yeah, let's do this.

01:26:00.906 --> 01:26:01.991
Watch this.

01:26:03.034 --> 01:26:04.326
Punch it!

01:26:08.998 --> 01:26:11.417
Got a little wrinkle. Not to worry.

01:26:19.258 --> 01:26:21.761
Kelly Robinson ain't
supposed to go out like this!

01:26:21.927 --> 01:26:24.430
I'm supposed to die in the ring!

01:26:30.311 --> 01:26:33.064
Kelly, you okay? Come here. You okay?

01:26:33.230 --> 01:26:35.149
Hell, no! I ain't okay.

01:26:35.316 --> 01:26:37.735
You just crashed my parade
down into the river.

01:26:37.902 --> 01:26:41.238
We had nozzle failure.
Then the thrust manifold went all haywire.

01:26:41.405 --> 01:26:44.241
You didn't check it, did you?
Huh? This is perfect!

01:26:44.408 --> 01:26:47.787
My first mission, I do everything right.
Now thanks to you, I ain't a hero!

01:26:48.204 --> 01:26:50.581
- What is that?
- This is my flotation device.

01:26:50.748 --> 01:26:51.957
- That's a bomb!
- What?

01:26:52.124 --> 01:26:53.834
That's a thermonuclear bomb.

01:26:55.544 --> 01:26:57.546
Why you gotta throw them
around here, then?

01:26:57.630 --> 01:27:00.549
No, it's okay. It's not armed.
Can you imagine if this had gone off?

01:27:00.966 --> 01:27:02.927
This would have killed millions!

01:27:03.010 --> 01:27:06.514
- And they didn't arm it?
- They didn't get a chance to.

01:27:06.597 --> 01:27:08.808
You know why they didn't get a chance to?

01:27:08.974 --> 01:27:10.309
Because we stopped them!

01:27:10.601 --> 01:27:12.394
We stopped them. Know what that means?

01:27:13.020 --> 01:27:15.356
- I think so.
- We heroes again!

01:27:15.523 --> 01:27:17.900
- Damn, you're right.
- You bet your pink ass I'm right!

01:27:18.067 --> 01:27:20.361
We're heroes again! Even without the plane.

01:27:20.528 --> 01:27:22.780
- We're heroes!
- This is the proof right here!

01:27:22.947 --> 01:27:25.407
- This bomb.
- I can't wait to call the President.

01:27:25.574 --> 01:27:28.577
We gonna get the Congressional
Medal of Honor and a parade!

01:27:28.744 --> 01:27:30.538
This is gonna be fantastic.

01:28:11.453 --> 01:28:13.831
Where you going? You forgot your drink.

01:28:13.998 --> 01:28:15.624
Alex, how are you?

01:28:16.333 --> 01:28:18.085
- God!
- Came prepared this time.

01:28:18.169 --> 01:28:19.211
Smart.

01:28:19.295 --> 01:28:20.963
Where you going? Back up.

01:28:21.046 --> 01:28:22.464
You thought you was gonna get away?

01:28:22.548 --> 01:28:24.717
Thought you was gonna
make a fool out of Kelly Robinson?

01:28:24.884 --> 01:28:28.053
When I have my parade,
I'll tie your ass to the front of a float.

01:28:29.054 --> 01:28:30.222
Alex?

01:28:31.891 --> 01:28:34.185
How about a stakeout
in Greece for two weeks?

01:28:35.603 --> 01:28:37.188
- Stakeout?
- Yeah.

01:28:37.938 --> 01:28:39.356
Two weeks?

01:28:41.567 --> 01:28:43.235
Hey! The answer is still no.

01:28:43.402 --> 01:28:46.572
I know. I was just imagining for a second.
There's no harm in...

01:28:46.739 --> 01:28:50.409
You taking a long time. Tell her no.
You getting lost in this. No!

01:28:50.618 --> 01:28:52.036
- No.
- In fact, say, "Hell, no!"

01:28:52.661 --> 01:28:54.705
- Hell, no.
- "Hell, no, bitch!"

01:28:55.748 --> 01:28:57.625
Sorry. The spell wore off.

01:28:58.209 --> 01:29:02.755
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Well, boys,
I'm glad you guys got all the news coverage.

01:29:03.422 --> 01:29:06.008
- What's that mean?
- She's always got to have the last word.

01:29:06.175 --> 01:29:08.219
She always gotta say some shit, huh?

01:29:08.844 --> 01:29:11.513
What she talking about, news coverage?
Ain't been no news...

01:29:12.264 --> 01:29:13.474
Is that Carlos?

01:29:15.100 --> 01:29:17.228
- "Superspy hero thwarts..."
- So Carlos was good.

01:29:17.728 --> 01:29:20.397
- We the ones that saved the day!
- Is this a parade?

01:29:20.731 --> 01:29:23.275
Yes! Look at the spectacle
and the glitter and shit!

01:29:23.442 --> 01:29:25.069
That's my parade! He stole my parade!

01:29:25.236 --> 01:29:27.738
- I don't know what to say.
- I know what to say. Bullshit!

01:29:28.113 --> 01:29:29.657
Bullshit!

01:29:31.784 --> 01:29:32.952
Bullshit!

01:29:33.160 --> 01:29:35.287
We gotta go to Washington
and get debriefed.

01:29:35.704 --> 01:29:37.539
- I ain't going!
- I don't blame you.

01:29:37.706 --> 01:29:40.167
It's just, I was looking forward
to testing out the hover gel with you.

01:29:43.671 --> 01:29:45.422
- The whatsit gel?
- Hover.

01:29:45.547 --> 01:29:48.092
It's a gelatinous hydrogen diphyoxide.

01:29:48.259 --> 01:29:51.136
It's 12 times lighter than air.
You smear it all over your body,

01:29:51.303 --> 01:29:53.722
and as long as you're
in an oxygen-rich environment,

01:29:53.806 --> 01:29:56.141
it allows you to float down
to earth like a bird.

01:29:58.769 --> 01:30:00.479
Like a jelly bird?

01:30:00.646 --> 01:30:04.316
Yeah. That's the street name for it.
"Jelly Bird." Exactly.

01:30:04.483 --> 01:30:06.652
They have a couple for us
on the transport plane.

01:30:06.819 --> 01:30:10.447
Plan was, they drop us off over D.C.,
and we float down like birds.

01:30:10.614 --> 01:30:14.326
There's press and photographers.
It's gonna be a whole spectacle, but...

01:30:15.035 --> 01:30:16.787
What we waiting on? Let's do this.

01:30:17.079 --> 01:30:18.998
- You'll do it?
- Hell, yeah, I'll do it!

01:30:19.164 --> 01:30:21.500
Float like a jelly bird?
Let's go right now.

01:30:21.667 --> 01:30:23.794
I used to always dream I'd be able to fly.

01:30:23.961 --> 01:30:26.005
- Are you serious?
- My grandma said I was a damn fool.

01:30:26.171 --> 01:30:27.798
That's what made her
punch me the first time!

01:30:27.881 --> 01:30:30.384
- See, I told her and...
- Hold on.

01:30:30.509 --> 01:30:33.012
Get a couple jars of jelly
on the plane and two parachutes.
