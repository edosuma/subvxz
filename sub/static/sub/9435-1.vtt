00:40.360 --> 00:48.240
This programme contains some
strong language and scenes which
some viewers may find upsetting.

00:51.160 --> 00:53.240
Time.

00:53.240 --> 00:54.720
This is the strangest one.

00:56.480 --> 01:00.920
Do you know that the worst part

01:00.920 --> 01:04.360
and yet the best part of being
in solitary confinement is

01:04.360 --> 01:08.440
time can be a blisteringly fast
thing,

01:08.440 --> 01:10.480
where in the blink of an eye,

01:10.480 --> 01:14.040
you can look, and ten years
are gone from your life.

01:14.040 --> 01:15.440
But the next week is agony.

01:17.560 --> 01:20.720
It's like you
look at your wristwatch

01:20.720 --> 01:26.760
and instead of there being a face,
there's a calendar and it flips.

01:26.760 --> 01:29.360
But then,
if you look out the window,

01:29.360 --> 01:32.000
it takes all day for that
sun to go down.

01:33.640 --> 01:35.360
HE INHALES

01:35.360 --> 01:37.000
I always wanted to tell
somebody that.

03:43.400 --> 03:45.600
We got into the prison
about 11.00am.

03:47.080 --> 03:49.760
They took all the other
prisoners off this bus

03:49.760 --> 03:52.560
and then four men came on.

03:52.560 --> 03:54.800
They lined up against this red brick
wall...

03:56.360 --> 03:58.120
..and here comes Lieutenant Borner.

04:00.360 --> 04:02.000
He walked right up to me,

04:02.000 --> 04:04.760
right up to my face - he was
like very quiet, like...

04:06.160 --> 04:08.440
"There's no speaking in my prison.

04:08.440 --> 04:12.880
"Dead men do not speak in my prison,
especially. Do you understand me?"

04:12.880 --> 04:17.680
Just like that, same tone of voice.
Nothing raised, nothing threatening.

04:19.160 --> 04:22.800
And that Lord quietness...I did,
I went to answer. I was like, "B..."

04:25.080 --> 04:26.480
Backhanded me right in the mouth.

04:27.920 --> 04:30.240
It like stung like you
wouldn't believe.

04:30.240 --> 04:31.760
DOOR SLAMS

04:33.240 --> 04:38.080
And then I was thrown into this
world where there's no sunlight

04:38.080 --> 04:39.640
and it's deadly silent.

04:47.440 --> 04:51.160
You see, the Pennsylvania prison
system was developed by the Quakers.

04:53.320 --> 04:56.800
The doors were cut low, so you had
to stoop and bow to go into them...

04:59.000 --> 05:01.840
..and while you were in the cell,
you were meant not to communicate.

05:01.840 --> 05:03.240
It was part of your punishment.

05:05.640 --> 05:07.080
And it was eerie,

05:07.080 --> 05:12.120
because of almost 140 men at
the time in B Block, no-one spoke.

05:13.600 --> 05:16.400
You'd hear them cough or urinate
and flush the toilet

05:16.400 --> 05:17.680
but there was no real sound.

05:20.120 --> 05:21.800
And that was the worst for me,

05:21.800 --> 05:23.760
especially the first
couple of months.

05:27.360 --> 05:30.360
You still can hear your mother
crying at the trial.

05:30.360 --> 05:34.400
You can still smell the aftershave
on the witnesses, man -

05:34.400 --> 05:37.840
I mean, like it's just every little
detail's just eating your life,

05:37.840 --> 05:40.360
because you've just been put here.

05:40.360 --> 05:42.840
The door was just still ringing
in your ears cos of the slam

05:42.840 --> 05:44.880
and you're just left there,
and you're like...

05:44.880 --> 05:46.760
HE INHALES SHARPLY

05:48.360 --> 05:51.560
And yet, like, you don't
come to your door

05:51.560 --> 05:55.040
and talk to a neighbour,
cos if you broke the speaking rule,

05:55.040 --> 05:57.240
you were struck or
beaten by the guards.

06:04.800 --> 06:08.600
In level five,
you were allowed to exercise

06:08.600 --> 06:13.120
in these dog-kennel like cages,
19 feet long, ten feet wide.

06:16.200 --> 06:18.480
You got an hour to
exercise by yourself,

06:18.480 --> 06:21.040
cos you were a death-row prisoner.

06:21.040 --> 06:23.560
But the guards, being pricks -

06:23.560 --> 06:28.760
if you had a problem with another
guy, and they knew you were enemies,

06:28.760 --> 06:32.440
they'd put you in a cage
together, knowing that

06:32.440 --> 06:34.440
as soon as they'd walked off a few
steps,

06:34.440 --> 06:36.120
you two were going to go at it.

06:36.120 --> 06:39.120
And if that didn't work,
they simply picked out two big guys,

06:39.120 --> 06:41.360
and put them in together.

06:41.360 --> 06:43.840
And they had some fun.

06:43.840 --> 06:46.240
Usually it was a white guy
with a black guy,

06:46.240 --> 06:49.520
Spanish guy with a black guy,
Spanish guy with a white guy.

06:51.640 --> 06:53.520
Gladiatoring, they called it.

06:58.360 --> 07:04.440
SHOWER STARTS

07:04.440 --> 07:06.760
The shower was the most
vulnerable time.

07:08.320 --> 07:11.800
If you were going to get somebody,
that's the place to get them.

07:11.800 --> 07:16.160
You got access to them, there's no
handcuffs, and they're naked.

07:16.160 --> 07:20.160
SHOWER RUNS

07:22.080 --> 07:26.160
I had only been there a few days
and I walked into the shower

07:26.160 --> 07:28.880
and just as I turned the corner,
there was a Puerto Rican boy

07:28.880 --> 07:31.320
and he had sharpened
a pork chop bone

07:31.320 --> 07:34.800
and then stabbed this man
in the back of the liver with it and

07:34.800 --> 07:39.280
the guy started flopping, and then
they just cut all the water off

07:39.280 --> 07:43.120
and just beat all six of us
senseless and drug us back out of
the shower.

07:47.800 --> 07:50.240
And then they served food.

07:50.240 --> 07:53.680
Like they got everything cleaned up
and began serving lunch

07:53.680 --> 07:55.480
and it went on as a routine day.

07:55.480 --> 08:00.280
CANTEEN CHATTER

08:00.280 --> 08:02.880
And two guys were arguing,
cos one guy didn't get enough

08:02.880 --> 08:05.280
bread on his tray and I'm like -
this is crazy!

08:05.280 --> 08:08.200
You're so whacked out of your mind
that you're going to

08:08.200 --> 08:12.040
call down to that guard, "Hey, man!
I only got one slice of bread on my
tray,"

08:12.040 --> 08:14.040
when a human being just died!

08:26.120 --> 08:28.840
I lived in silence.

08:28.840 --> 08:31.120
For two whole years.

08:31.120 --> 08:32.280
The first two years.

08:34.200 --> 08:37.840
And that's when the drugs were
discovered in the choir room.

08:37.840 --> 08:39.400
And everything changed.

08:41.720 --> 08:44.320
These prisoners from the choir
were locked up with us

08:44.320 --> 08:46.480
in empty cells on death row.

08:47.920 --> 08:53.240
And because none of them were going
to tell where the drugs came from,

08:53.240 --> 08:58.080
they were going to ship all of them
to individual different prisons.

08:59.240 --> 09:02.040
To the other eight members of the
choir, it really didn't matter.

09:04.480 --> 09:08.400
But two of the men had a bond that
was special. Wesley and Butch.

09:09.880 --> 09:14.760
Wesley was this fair-skinned,
green-eyed beautiful black guy

09:14.760 --> 09:18.600
who just exuded this eloquence
and sweetness about him.

09:18.600 --> 09:20.000
Everyone liked him.

09:21.320 --> 09:24.800
And he had a voice
that was gravelly and wondrous.

09:26.800 --> 09:29.160
He had met Butch when they were
children in the church

09:29.160 --> 09:32.120
in West Philadelphia,
where Butch was a foster child.

09:33.600 --> 09:37.760
Obviously, Wesley was gay and
they formed this bond that seemed

09:37.760 --> 09:39.920
to like be invulnerable.

09:39.920 --> 09:43.880
And then, Butch began stealing
and getting in trouble

09:43.880 --> 09:47.480
and he was arrested and thrown
into county prison in Philadelphia

09:47.480 --> 09:49.040
and Wesley went nuts without him.

09:49.040 --> 09:51.280
He was the only thing in his life
that protected him

09:51.280 --> 09:54.320
from the scorn of his parents,
the bullies in the neighbourhood,

09:54.320 --> 09:57.640
the people who knew
he was weak without Butch.

09:57.640 --> 10:00.240
So he began committing
deliberate crimes

10:00.240 --> 10:04.040
and getting arrested
so that he could be with Butch

10:04.040 --> 10:08.960
and they found out prison was
the one place they could be normal.

10:08.960 --> 10:12.600
They got themselves
put into the same cell and together,

10:12.600 --> 10:16.880
in the setting of a prison,
where homosexuality is an accepted

10:16.880 --> 10:21.520
form of expression, or just life,
no-one bothered them.

10:23.880 --> 10:26.360
And that's when the drugs were
discovered and the guard

10:26.360 --> 10:30.040
on duty at nine o'clock that night
started tormenting Wesley.

10:30.040 --> 10:32.560
"Hey, faggot, you're going.

10:32.560 --> 10:35.680
"Your boy's going to Western.
I just looked on the transfer sheet.

10:35.680 --> 10:37.240
"You're going to Dallas.

10:37.240 --> 10:40.560
"Opposite ends of the State
of Pennsylvania. Bye, nigger!"

10:44.080 --> 10:47.560
And I guess Wesley went
crazy in the cell.

10:47.560 --> 10:51.040
Cos about 40 minutes later,
just before ten o'clock, there was

10:51.040 --> 10:53.760
like 20 minutes left before shift
change at 10.00pm.

10:55.040 --> 10:58.640
This voice took over.

10:58.640 --> 11:03.960
# Ah, oooh

11:03.960 --> 11:05.240
# Yeah

11:05.240 --> 11:10.280
# I have a dream, the dream
Of every common man... #

11:10.280 --> 11:14.960
Every man on that block
just stood still.

11:14.960 --> 11:18.960
# I have sworn by my blood
as your man, my love... #

11:18.960 --> 11:20.800
We knew the penalty.

11:20.800 --> 11:25.360
# That one day, I promise one day
all of your heartaches
would stop... #

11:25.360 --> 11:28.360
Then you heard the keys.
HE MIMICS RATTLE OF KEYS

11:28.360 --> 11:30.640
The footsteps behind it.

11:30.640 --> 11:33.360
"What the fuck are you doing,
singing in my block?

11:33.360 --> 11:38.280
"I will beat your head in.
If you don't stop that singing right
now, I will beat your head in."

11:38.280 --> 11:42.840
# Oh, thanks to you baby

11:42.840 --> 11:45.800
SINGER LAUGHS
# For just loving a common man... #

11:45.800 --> 11:48.320
More keys.
# I want to thank you this evening,
honey... #

11:48.320 --> 11:50.800
HE MIMICS KEYS SHAKING
Here they come.

11:50.800 --> 11:54.360
Everybody knows what's coming.
# I thought that I'd failed you... #

11:54.360 --> 11:56.080
The lieutenant came running down

11:56.080 --> 11:58.640
and he was this militant asshole
with the brush cut

11:58.640 --> 12:00.680
and the uniform that was
pressed to precision

12:00.680 --> 12:05.160
and he ran down and he ran down
and he said, "Hold it." Like that.

12:05.160 --> 12:08.280
And even Wesley stopped cos
we know, when Lieutenant Norris

12:08.280 --> 12:10.280
raised his hand, that was it.

12:10.280 --> 12:14.520
He said, "I leave in 20 minutes.

12:14.520 --> 12:21.880
"If there is a noise on this block,
from anyone, when I leave this unit,
we will beat every man's head in.

12:21.880 --> 12:24.800
"Do you understand me?" Silence.

12:26.680 --> 12:29.720
"Finish that song, inmate.
Let's go."

12:29.720 --> 12:33.120
The guards looked at him
like he had lost his frigging mind.

12:33.120 --> 12:35.160
They were stunned.

12:35.160 --> 12:38.400
"Let's go. You.
You've got 20 minutes."

12:38.400 --> 12:41.000
And walked off the block.
HE MIMICS KEYS SHAKING

12:42.680 --> 12:45.240
He even had an argument on the way
out of the door.

12:45.240 --> 12:47.440
When the gates shut...
GATE SLAMS

12:47.440 --> 12:52.040
..that big wide B block gate -
when they left the block alone,

12:52.040 --> 12:54.360
we were like...

12:54.360 --> 12:58.960
"Oh, my God! We are totally
and utterly unsupervised."

13:00.200 --> 13:04.920
And he came back right in mid-lyric
like he had never stopped singing.

13:04.920 --> 13:08.120
# You said, "I love you, baby

13:08.120 --> 13:12.160
# I love you for just
being a common man... #

13:12.160 --> 13:14.200
SINGER JOINS ON BASS NOTE

13:14.200 --> 13:16.680
And like you could hear them,
here they come,

13:16.680 --> 13:19.440
the other members that had a little
bit of guts, yeah?

13:19.440 --> 13:21.280
They were blowing, you know?

13:21.280 --> 13:24.000
They were giving bass,
and it was wonderful.

13:24.000 --> 13:25.480
These voices, yeah?

13:25.480 --> 13:30.520
# I thank you, baby, yeah,
for respecting me, yeah

13:30.520 --> 13:33.560
# I want to thank you, baby

13:33.560 --> 13:37.000
# For telling me

13:37.000 --> 13:40.640
# I want thank you for respecting me

13:40.640 --> 13:43.480
# In a time of worry

13:43.480 --> 13:45.680
# Thank you for calming my
troubles... #

13:45.680 --> 13:50.360
GOSPEL-TYPE VOICES CONTINUE

13:50.360 --> 13:53.760
FINGER-CLICKS KEEP BEAT

13:53.760 --> 13:55.120
Then, out of nowhere...

13:55.120 --> 13:58.840
# Ooh... #

13:58.840 --> 14:02.040
..we heard this woman's voice.

14:02.040 --> 14:05.840
Dorothy Moore's Misty Blue.

14:05.840 --> 14:08.720
# Ah... #

14:08.720 --> 14:13.120
I thought, I swear to God, somebody
had gotten a radio in on B Block.

14:13.120 --> 14:17.240
# Ah

14:17.240 --> 14:20.280
# Looks like I'd get you... #

14:20.280 --> 14:24.880
No-one really knew who it was that
was singing and then I figured it
out.

14:24.880 --> 14:29.480
Butch was six foot four and 240lbs.

14:30.600 --> 14:34.440
He had a big jagged scar that ran
down the side of his face,

14:34.440 --> 14:38.560
like from someone trying to cut his
head open.

14:38.560 --> 14:40.800
I was terrified of this man.

14:40.800 --> 14:44.960
# Oh, honey

14:44.960 --> 14:47.640
# Just the mention of your name... #

14:47.640 --> 14:50.480
To hear him sing in this beautiful
voice...

14:50.480 --> 14:54.400
# Turns the flicker to a flame... #

14:54.400 --> 15:00.160
..as his way of showing love for
someone who was being taken from him
the next morning

15:00.160 --> 15:05.840
made me want someone to care for me
in that place so much

15:05.840 --> 15:11.720
that they would sing, knowing that
singing would have gotten their head
beat in.

15:23.920 --> 15:26.640
They shipped Wesley that morning
at 3:55am.

15:28.600 --> 15:30.520
But the next day,

15:30.520 --> 15:34.280
like a few guys were talking outside
of their cells to each other,

15:34.280 --> 15:37.400
like a normal conversation,
and when the guard went by

15:37.400 --> 15:41.680
he didn't tell them that they
was going to beat their brains in,
he just simply said,

15:41.680 --> 15:44.000
"Keep that down, the lieutenant
doesn't like it.

15:45.440 --> 15:47.960
They weren't going to torture us
with silence any more.

15:55.200 --> 15:57.320
CELL DOOR OPENS

15:57.320 --> 15:59.160
BUZZER

16:03.400 --> 16:07.680
Joe Bullen, my first appellate
attorney, God bless him,

16:07.680 --> 16:11.840
got the attention
of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court.

16:11.840 --> 16:16.080
He didn't like me,
but he filed the appeal nonetheless

16:16.080 --> 16:19.320
and got us the hearing
scheduled for February 20th.

16:23.120 --> 16:25.000
I was excited to go to court,
you know.

16:30.240 --> 16:33.280
Two Delaware County sheriffs
were waiting for me.

16:33.280 --> 16:36.040
They come up,
they put the handcuffs on me.

16:37.160 --> 16:39.240
Both men were in their 60s.

16:39.240 --> 16:43.000
Two sweetheart guys who were already
bullshitting about basketball

16:43.000 --> 16:45.600
and football and all this stuff
in Philadelphia.

16:45.600 --> 16:47.920
They're giving me
updates on some things that

16:47.920 --> 16:51.280
I haven't caught up on and people
back down in the county jail

16:51.280 --> 16:53.200
who was going up
to the state prison.

16:55.840 --> 16:59.880
We're talking about how damn
cold it is. It was bitterly cold.

16:59.880 --> 17:02.720
In fact, it was the coldest
day of the year that year.

17:10.640 --> 17:13.920
I'm sitting in the back
and we're driving along.

17:13.920 --> 17:17.400
And we get down there
four-and-a-half hours later.

17:17.400 --> 17:22.520
It's now about 4:30pm, almost
5:00pm, and nearly pitch dark.

17:27.079 --> 17:29.200
We pull in to go to the bathroom.

17:31.000 --> 17:34.000
The driver drives past it
by like 25 yards.

17:35.960 --> 17:39.640
We get out of the car and we're
hit with that blast of cold.

17:41.680 --> 17:46.200
We run right over, the three of us,
to the cubicle and I go in

17:46.200 --> 17:49.880
and the door is being held
open by the taller officer.

17:49.880 --> 17:53.400
And he stands there
while I urinate and watches me.

17:55.440 --> 17:57.440
I'm peeing,
I'm minding my own business,

17:57.440 --> 18:00.360
I'm thinking about getting
back into that warm-ass car.

18:00.360 --> 18:03.520
It's freezing, I turn, I look up,
he's got his hand up,

18:03.520 --> 18:06.880
I put my head under his arm
and I make a left turn

18:06.880 --> 18:09.080
to go back to the car.

18:09.080 --> 18:14.440
What I did not know is that the
officer who was driving

18:14.440 --> 18:17.720
went back to the car and waited.

18:17.720 --> 18:21.360
I came out of the cubicle
and started trotting towards him.

18:21.360 --> 18:24.680
He looked past me
and he didn't see his partner.

18:24.680 --> 18:28.040
He doesn't know
if I've killed his partner or not.

18:28.040 --> 18:31.400
He just knew he was seeing
a death row prisoner

18:31.400 --> 18:33.320
running at him unescorted.

18:33.320 --> 18:35.480
That's when he pulled his gun.

18:35.480 --> 18:39.840
When he did that motion of sticking
his hand on his hip and pulling

18:39.840 --> 18:43.480
the weapon from the holster,
I just turned and started running.

18:43.480 --> 18:47.080
He fired that weapon and it was
like this huge percussion.

18:47.080 --> 18:48.800
GUNSHOT

18:50.680 --> 18:57.360
At 2,700 feet per second,
that bullet went past my ear

18:57.360 --> 19:00.960
and so did anything else that
I was looking behind me for.

19:04.800 --> 19:07.200
I went down and I hit the ground

19:07.200 --> 19:10.800
and ripped all of the skin on my
hands and it's just like... Oooh!

19:10.800 --> 19:13.560
Then they started
this attitude, you know,

19:13.560 --> 19:16.000
"That's it.
I'm going to do what I got to do."

19:16.000 --> 19:19.040
So I just got up and I ran towards
the big plate-glass window

19:19.040 --> 19:21.480
of the restaurant next door.

19:22.640 --> 19:26.120
I figured if I'm running directly
at the window, he can't shoot me.

19:27.640 --> 19:33.040
I ran about 100 yards
across the road and I circled back.

19:34.720 --> 19:37.480
And I came right back
to where I had escaped.

19:37.480 --> 19:40.800
Now, I'm looking at them as
they're yelling at each other

19:40.800 --> 19:44.440
who was the bigger idiot for letting
this happen and then I hear them.

19:44.440 --> 19:47.040
POLICE SIRENS

19:47.040 --> 19:49.000
All the sirens
in the world are coming.

19:50.280 --> 19:52.280
There was cars
coming from everywhere.

19:55.200 --> 19:58.240
They had an escaped
death row prisoner alert.

19:58.240 --> 20:00.120
They pulled out all the stops.

20:02.360 --> 20:04.560
So I took my eye glasses off,

20:04.560 --> 20:08.040
pulled the plastic off the end
of the eyeglasses and I stuck

20:08.040 --> 20:12.240
the eyeglass pin into the handcuffs
and I picked the handcuffs.

20:13.680 --> 20:17.080
I could see the buildings off to
my right and one of them had a flag.

20:17.080 --> 20:19.200
That's a police station.

20:19.200 --> 20:22.840
I said, man, I'm going
to hide behind the police station.

20:22.840 --> 20:25.360
So I navigated down
behind this alleyway

20:25.360 --> 20:30.360
and I got down in this recessed
area and I just huddle

20:30.360 --> 20:32.160
and I just waited.

20:34.360 --> 20:36.240
I was so cold.

20:36.240 --> 20:40.760
When I lost my core temperature
like an hour later, I was shivering.

20:40.760 --> 20:43.640
I was like, oh my God,
this is killing me.

20:43.640 --> 20:46.840
I was going into these bends.
It was hurting.

20:46.840 --> 20:52.080
My ribs were aching from going into
these convulsions like that.

20:52.080 --> 20:54.080
So I was hurting so bad.

20:54.080 --> 20:56.160
I'm going to get up
and get out of here.

20:56.160 --> 20:59.360
I came flying out of that
parking lot and they saw me.

20:59.360 --> 21:01.040
HELICOPTER ROTOR BLADES

21:03.080 --> 21:06.840
This guy came out of nowhere,
just hovered above me.

21:06.840 --> 21:11.160
And the blinding candlelight of this
magnitude, I can't even describe.

21:11.160 --> 21:14.440
And he circled
and he had the whole area lit.

21:14.440 --> 21:17.120
He came back, he lit me up
and lit me up.

21:17.120 --> 21:20.720
This guy chased me for literally
three hours with this helicopter.

21:22.000 --> 21:26.400
My feet split open, my calves
erupted, my hamstrings were pulled.

21:27.600 --> 21:29.360
But I got lucky, didn't I?

21:30.560 --> 21:34.600
The helicopter had a FLIR -
forward-looking infrared camera

21:34.600 --> 21:39.680
and it wasn't working because
it was so cold it malfunctioned.

21:46.120 --> 21:49.160
I ended up on a pair
of railroad tracks

21:49.160 --> 21:52.440
where I walked on broken feet
for five miles.

21:53.520 --> 21:56.600
Until I got to Frazer Pennsylvania
where I stole a car.

21:58.800 --> 22:01.600
It was a 1965 green Mustang.

22:03.280 --> 22:05.160
I found a quarter.

22:05.160 --> 22:08.360
I went over to the coin box
and I called a family member.

22:10.920 --> 22:13.960
I drove over to the house
and they gave me $100,

22:13.960 --> 22:16.760
a handful of bandages and gauze

22:16.760 --> 22:20.840
and then a Philadelphia
green Eagles ski cap.

22:20.840 --> 22:24.440
Like that wasn't going to give
away my city location!

22:27.120 --> 22:30.280
I drove to New York City
and I got a hotel room

22:30.280 --> 22:33.960
in the Bowery in a flophouse
on the lower East Side.

22:33.960 --> 22:35.880
Seven dollars a night.

22:35.880 --> 22:38.200
I paid for a whole week in advance

22:38.200 --> 22:42.240
and then I went to a little bodega
and I got a box of Epsom salt

22:42.240 --> 22:44.040
and went up to my room.

22:47.080 --> 22:49.040
Oh, my God.

22:49.040 --> 22:53.400
Like, I literally had
institutional sock

22:53.400 --> 22:56.360
all threaded into the torn
tissue of my feet.

22:56.360 --> 22:58.400
And I just soaked in it

22:58.400 --> 23:00.640
and I started pulling it out
and it was like...

23:02.480 --> 23:04.920
I would just cry, man.
The first three days...

23:04.920 --> 23:08.680
That's why I didn't even venture
out. I literally couldn't walk.

23:10.800 --> 23:12.680
CAR HORNS

23:17.840 --> 23:20.880
After four days,
I went out one evening.

23:20.880 --> 23:23.520
It was excruciating
to finally go out.

23:23.520 --> 23:27.840
And Macy's had this long display
window of all the electronic

23:27.840 --> 23:31.120
products and there were all these
televisions and on them

23:31.120 --> 23:34.440
were all these different channels
and on some of them was the news

23:34.440 --> 23:39.640
and there was the video footage
of me obviously being hunted.

23:39.640 --> 23:43.880
And in that one moment I was
hit by the reality, I'm not free.

23:43.880 --> 23:46.360
Not by a damn shot.
I am just like...

23:46.360 --> 23:48.200
I'm temporarily out on a leash

23:48.200 --> 23:50.440
and if they catch me
I'm going to catch a bullet.

23:50.440 --> 23:52.640
Like, it was so terrifying
in that moment.

23:56.440 --> 23:59.760
In 1985 you didn't need to even show
photo identification

23:59.760 --> 24:01.760
to get on an aeroplane.

24:01.760 --> 24:04.040
You didn't have to show
who you were or anything.

24:05.320 --> 24:07.680
So I went to this
upscale restaurant.

24:09.760 --> 24:12.560
And I just waited and waited.
I waited by the men's room.

24:12.560 --> 24:13.960
Waiting, waiting.

24:15.560 --> 24:19.640
As soon as I saw a guy go in the
bathroom without a jacket on,

24:19.640 --> 24:22.160
I walked over to his table
and I stole his jacket

24:22.160 --> 24:24.440
and he had his wallet in his jacket.

24:25.680 --> 24:29.160
Then I went to the cloakroom
and grabbed a fur coat.

24:29.160 --> 24:31.040
And I left.

24:44.240 --> 24:46.480
So I simply just used
the credit card,

24:46.480 --> 24:49.400
bought last-minute tickets
to Orlando

24:49.400 --> 24:52.560
and when I got to Orlando
I told the taxi driver

24:52.560 --> 24:56.000
to take me to the pawn shop area.

25:02.680 --> 25:06.040
When I went into the shop
the guy behind the counter,

25:06.040 --> 25:08.200
the owner, was obviously a criminal.

25:09.360 --> 25:10.960
So I told him,

25:10.960 --> 25:14.120
"I don't have any identification
but I want to sell you this coat."

25:18.160 --> 25:23.440
So I negotiated with him to give me
a gun and $100 for the coat,

25:23.440 --> 25:25.280
which was worth $5,000.

25:25.280 --> 25:26.960
A very nice fur coat.

25:30.240 --> 25:34.000
And so after he gave me the gun,
he refused to give me bullets,

25:34.000 --> 25:37.800
he asked me if I was willing
to rob this guy that he knew,

25:37.800 --> 25:41.560
Anthony Manilla, who had a
collection of gold coins

25:41.560 --> 25:43.680
that were worth $350 each.

25:43.680 --> 25:46.920
He said there was at least 100
of these coins in this guy's house.

25:52.160 --> 25:55.520
I met Anthony Manilla just
outside of his house.

25:55.520 --> 25:58.280
I was driving by on a bicycle
I had bought at a flea market.

25:58.280 --> 26:01.800
So when I rode by I pretended that
I recognised him from prison.

26:02.920 --> 26:04.800
Anthony knew he didn't know me

26:04.800 --> 26:08.560
but he pretended he also recognised
me in that fake way some people do.

26:10.080 --> 26:11.840
He asked me what I was up to.

26:11.840 --> 26:13.640
I told him I had these pills
for sale

26:13.640 --> 26:15.680
but I couldn't find anybody
to buy them.

26:15.680 --> 26:18.880
So he told me he could get me
$7 each for them if I waited.

26:20.480 --> 26:23.760
Now, I knew and he knew that
each pill was worth $30 each.

26:25.240 --> 26:28.360
The cops in the area know
he doesn't have a valid licence.

26:28.360 --> 26:30.680
So he actually gave me the wheel.

26:41.800 --> 26:45.320
We drive towards where I tell him
I have the drugs stashed.

26:47.800 --> 26:50.680
I pulled the gun
and I said, "OK, freeze, I got you."

26:50.680 --> 26:52.760
And he was like, "OK, take it easy."

26:54.160 --> 26:56.680
I pulled over
and demanded that he give me

26:56.680 --> 26:58.680
the nod of money he had been
bragging with.

26:58.680 --> 27:00.520
He gave me that.

27:00.520 --> 27:04.600
He had a Rolex watch and he had
diamond jewellery all over him.

27:05.680 --> 27:07.520
I said, "Now I've got to tie you up

27:07.520 --> 27:10.680
"because I've got to go back
into your house and get that money."

27:10.680 --> 27:14.320
He flat out refused.
I said, "What do you mean, no?"

27:14.320 --> 27:16.880
This is like a 140 pound person.

27:16.880 --> 27:19.640
I grabbed him
and I said, "Please hold still."

27:19.640 --> 27:23.800
I tied his hands up, put him in the
trunk, I slammed the trunk deck down

27:23.800 --> 27:27.520
and I don't know that the trunk
deck clasp has gone through

27:27.520 --> 27:31.000
the rope and is now just
stuck but not locked

27:31.000 --> 27:34.080
because three red lights later
he jumps out

27:34.080 --> 27:37.280
and when he jumps out he looks
like a mummy who has unravelled

27:37.280 --> 27:40.240
and he runs up to the car behind and
knocks on the window

27:40.240 --> 27:42.920
and says, "He tried to rob me!
He's trying to rob me!"

27:42.920 --> 27:44.840
And then he ran off.

27:44.840 --> 27:47.680
The two women in my rear-view
were looking at each other

27:47.680 --> 27:51.720
and looking at me and I just gunned
it across the red light and went

27:51.720 --> 27:55.800
flying across to Station Road and
went right up the middle of Orlando.

27:55.800 --> 27:58.520
And I didn't go back to his house.

28:02.440 --> 28:04.520
So I drove all night.

28:06.400 --> 28:09.960
At 2:30am in the morning I get to
Daytona Beach, Volusia County.

28:11.040 --> 28:13.480
And it's Bike Week, March 10th.

28:15.920 --> 28:19.240
I've been an escaped
prisoner for 25 days.

28:20.320 --> 28:25.480
And I'm sitting there and I'm like,
I can't get a hotel room anywhere.

28:25.480 --> 28:28.280
It's booked, everything is solid.

28:28.280 --> 28:31.880
My eyes were all gravelly
and I was just so exhausted.

28:31.880 --> 28:35.320
So I just put the seat back
and went to sleep.

28:38.640 --> 28:40.400
The next thing I know,

28:40.400 --> 28:46.400
three sharp raps right on the window
and there's a cop right there.

28:46.400 --> 28:48.480
My heart is pounding.

28:49.800 --> 28:52.880
He's making the motion like this
so I put the window down.

28:52.880 --> 28:55.800
He said, "Did you hear anybody
screaming?" I said, "What?"

28:55.800 --> 28:57.960
He said "Some woman screaming.

28:57.960 --> 29:00.800
"There's been a call, a domestic
dispute. Is there a problem?"

29:02.120 --> 29:04.960
And I was like, "No."

29:04.960 --> 29:09.320
I was talking to him and I was just
focusing on him trying to answer him

29:09.320 --> 29:12.680
and that's when I heard
from the passenger side

29:12.680 --> 29:16.160
the other officer yell,
"Hey Bert, there's a gun."

29:16.160 --> 29:18.480
And he immediately pulled
his weapon and I said,

29:18.480 --> 29:20.200
"Hold on, hold on. What's up?"

29:20.200 --> 29:22.120
I didn't know this,

29:22.120 --> 29:26.800
but about that much of the pistol
was laying out under a blanket.

29:28.480 --> 29:31.080
So I got out of the car,
I had my hands up.

29:32.160 --> 29:33.800
I gave a false name.

29:35.120 --> 29:37.080
They put handcuffs on me.
They locked me up.

29:39.360 --> 29:41.920
I'm sitting in prison and waiting.

29:43.280 --> 29:45.080
And I said, to hell with this.

29:45.080 --> 29:47.120
TELEPHONE RINGS

29:48.680 --> 29:50.400
My father immediately picked up.

29:50.400 --> 29:51.800
Hello?

29:51.800 --> 29:56.160
I said, "Dad I need you to call
the FBI and tell them where I'm at.

29:56.160 --> 29:59.600
"If they don't come and get me
I'm going to go before this

29:59.600 --> 30:02.760
"judge in the morning and I'm going
to bail out and get out of here."

30:04.040 --> 30:05.800
He hung up the phone.

30:05.800 --> 30:10.640
He called an agent by the name of
Bud Warner, Philadelphia FBI office.

30:11.960 --> 30:14.960
Man, the doors came open.
They came flying in there.

30:14.960 --> 30:17.200
DOOR SLAMS

30:21.840 --> 30:25.080
They added 35 more years
to my sentence for that robbery.

30:26.800 --> 30:28.520
Put me on death row in Florida.

30:30.160 --> 30:33.120
And left me there to swelter
all through that summer.

30:36.200 --> 30:38.720
By the time they came
and got me in September

30:38.720 --> 30:41.240
I was so eager to go back
to Pennsylvania,

30:41.240 --> 30:45.200
even though I knew I was going
to get some serious beatings.

30:49.280 --> 30:51.720
I had made an enemy
of every guard on shift.

30:53.120 --> 30:55.880
I was going to go through
some extreme punishment.

30:58.240 --> 30:59.880
Man, it was hard.

31:18.080 --> 31:21.360
I stewed and I seethed.

31:24.320 --> 31:26.920
I was so angry
I was beating my head on the wall.

31:29.680 --> 31:33.120
So every couple of weeks they would
take me out and patch my head up.

31:37.320 --> 31:39.080
And, erm...

31:40.800 --> 31:43.080
This one officer
when he was escorting me back

31:43.080 --> 31:46.240
from the nurse's station
stopped by this cell

31:46.240 --> 31:48.360
and he said "Go in there
and get them books."

31:49.560 --> 31:52.880
So this guard,
nice guy too turned out to be,

31:52.880 --> 31:56.880
he lets me go in to the cell
and I get these books.

31:56.880 --> 32:01.080
And some of them were just too
hard to read, you know.

32:11.760 --> 32:17.320
You see, by the time I reached the
eighth grade at the age of 13,

32:17.320 --> 32:21.560
school was just an area
to meet up with your friends

32:21.560 --> 32:24.720
to go swimming or fighting,
you know.

32:27.360 --> 32:32.200
So my reading comprehension level
was basic, to say the least.

32:35.480 --> 32:39.640
But patience
and I had all the time in the world.

32:41.200 --> 32:43.240
So I started working
with these books.

32:46.840 --> 32:51.680
In the front of the General
Education Development booklet

32:51.680 --> 32:54.200
was a note, 'Tips Of Learning'.

32:54.200 --> 32:56.680
And it said, "If you take a word

32:56.680 --> 33:01.040
"and write out its spelling 10 times
while covering each previous one

33:01.040 --> 33:05.840
"and then apply each of those
to 10 sentences using that word,

33:05.840 --> 33:07.760
"you will not forget that word."

33:07.760 --> 33:09.560
The 10 times rule.

33:09.560 --> 33:14.000
So I sat there with a pen and
every word I didn't understand

33:14.000 --> 33:16.280
I did the 10 times rule to it.

33:16.280 --> 33:20.080
I remember I would go
through a day

33:20.080 --> 33:23.840
where I would have 50 word days,
40 word days,

33:23.840 --> 33:27.120
I counted days sometimes
on the accomplishments

33:27.120 --> 33:32.240
of being able to sit down
and to orally go and say,

33:32.240 --> 33:34.640
Robert is a triskaidekaphobic.

33:34.640 --> 33:37.120
Robert is afraid of the number 13.

33:37.120 --> 33:40.640
Robert does not understand
that it's just an illusion

33:40.640 --> 33:42.720
that 13 can harm him.

33:42.720 --> 33:45.920
And I would just talk to myself
until I had that one down.

33:45.920 --> 33:48.120
Then I would move on
to phantasmagoria

33:48.120 --> 33:50.240
and I would understand
that phantasmagoria

33:50.240 --> 33:52.680
was the fear of ghosts
and I'd like, boo!

33:52.680 --> 33:55.320
You know, so I just played with it

33:55.320 --> 33:59.720
and it just became this stupid
image of this kid

33:59.720 --> 34:03.800
sitting in a room by himself
entertaining himself with words.

34:03.800 --> 34:06.920
And it was quiet because I was
in the back of the B block

34:06.920 --> 34:08.840
and I was quietly just doing it.

34:08.840 --> 34:10.360
Triskaidekaphobia.

34:11.360 --> 34:13.000
The fear of 13.

34:15.639 --> 34:17.280
And like, it worked.

34:19.000 --> 34:23.280
For some reason, that small
gesture of humanity by that guard

34:23.280 --> 34:25.880
just changed everything for me.

34:33.920 --> 34:37.760
I loved it. I was hooked
on dime store novels.

34:37.760 --> 34:40.000
Series. Detective series.

34:40.000 --> 34:43.880
Jack Higgins, Robert Ludlum,
Elmore Leonard.

34:43.880 --> 34:46.120
The first 1,000 books,

34:46.120 --> 34:49.520
I remember I was so proud
of the accomplishment.

34:49.520 --> 34:52.520
I had written down 1,000 titles
of 1,000 different books

34:52.520 --> 34:54.239
that I had personally read.

34:54.239 --> 34:55.880
It took me three years.

34:57.960 --> 35:00.120
I loved Rudyard Kipling.

35:00.120 --> 35:02.560
I loved tales.

35:02.560 --> 35:07.280
I loved storytelling of tales
like Sinbad and Homer.

35:08.360 --> 35:12.280
Like, true story telling
is the telling of life.

35:12.280 --> 35:14.360
Isn't it?

35:14.360 --> 35:16.240
I loved it. I loved it.

35:18.120 --> 35:21.240
I'm so glad I was a
drug addict in one way.

35:21.240 --> 35:24.680
I was addicted to books and I got
hooked on them in the worst way.

35:28.200 --> 35:32.000
Meanwhile, I was reading law books
and studying serology.

35:32.000 --> 35:34.080
I went to college.

35:34.080 --> 35:37.720
I really opened up all this time
and structure for reading.

35:39.760 --> 35:45.200
And with every new book I found
something wonderful about myself.

35:45.200 --> 35:47.040
I found...

35:49.320 --> 35:51.720
I found myself.
Like, it was wonderful.

35:53.400 --> 35:57.840
I was happy on death row at times
when I shouldn't have been

35:57.840 --> 36:00.280
and it was only because
I became comfortable

36:00.280 --> 36:03.320
with being who I was,
finally, in life.

36:03.320 --> 36:05.720
CELL DOOR OPENS

36:05.720 --> 36:07.640
BUZZER

36:12.840 --> 36:14.520
And that's when I met Jackie.

36:16.080 --> 36:19.520
Jackie Schaefer was
a 31-year-old woman

36:19.520 --> 36:24.920
living in Pittsburgh's Pennsylvania
who was going to visit

36:24.920 --> 36:28.240
some death row prisoners
with her friend Pamela Tucker,

36:28.240 --> 36:30.800
who was the organiser
of an abolitionist group

36:30.800 --> 36:32.480
from Pennsylvania.

36:32.480 --> 36:35.040
They went monthly to
prisons around Pennsylvania

36:35.040 --> 36:38.400
and visited death row prisoners
to check on their mental state,

36:38.400 --> 36:41.440
to see if there were issues
they could get involved with to help

36:41.440 --> 36:45.280
the better treatment of the overall
population of death row prisoners.

36:45.280 --> 36:48.480
They came to the prison
and they visited five men.

36:48.480 --> 36:50.440
I was the fifth one.

36:50.440 --> 36:53.040
The other preceding prisoners
all went out there

36:53.040 --> 36:56.280
and lamented how terrible it was,
the things they were encountering,

36:56.280 --> 36:58.240
the conditions and all that.

36:58.240 --> 37:01.920
I walked in, I sat down
and said hello to my friend Pam.

37:01.920 --> 37:04.000
I asked her about her daughters.

37:04.000 --> 37:06.960
We interacted about a few things
and I turned to Jackie

37:06.960 --> 37:08.960
and I started flirting with her.

37:08.960 --> 37:11.120
I started being gregarious and open.

37:12.280 --> 37:15.840
It was completely unlike all
the other men who came out

37:15.840 --> 37:20.120
with little lists of things to talk
about, while I simply was myself.

37:22.000 --> 37:24.200
She came back the next
week by herself.

37:25.560 --> 37:27.000
Scared to death.

37:28.680 --> 37:36.480
So in this four foot by literally
five and a half foot walled room,

37:37.960 --> 37:43.000
she would walk in and sit down
with a notepad and we'd talk.

37:43.000 --> 37:45.280
Week after week.

37:47.160 --> 37:50.960
She drove 275 miles from Pittsburgh
to Huntington,

37:50.960 --> 37:55.480
through these mountains,
each way, and we'd start talking.

37:56.800 --> 37:58.480
And it was weird.

38:01.120 --> 38:06.120
I started to find out one
true thing about myself

38:06.120 --> 38:10.360
and I think this is true for every
prisoner who goes into prison

38:10.360 --> 38:15.000
at the age of 20 and is ready
to exit in his 30s or 40s.

38:16.240 --> 38:22.200
You can only grow so far as a man
until a woman teaches you

38:22.200 --> 38:25.120
enough about yourself
that you can further develop.

38:26.280 --> 38:29.280
And it's only through the eyes
of that person that you give

38:29.280 --> 38:32.440
yourself openly to
that they teach you

38:32.440 --> 38:35.680
so many things about yourself
that are qualities

38:35.680 --> 38:38.800
that you rely upon and like
and respect

38:38.800 --> 38:42.760
because you've been shown from afar
something no mirror,

38:42.760 --> 38:45.600
and believe me I didn't have
a mirror, could show you.

38:47.920 --> 38:51.640
But at the heart of it,
I kept feeling dirty.

38:53.120 --> 38:59.600
I did not want to be that prisoner
who is serving life

38:59.600 --> 39:02.040
who lets a woman
fall in love with him,

39:02.040 --> 39:04.640
knowing he's going
to suck the life out of her.

39:06.040 --> 39:10.120
I had the death penalty plus 105
years. I wasn't going anywhere.

39:15.240 --> 39:18.240
And then I get a newspaper.

39:23.600 --> 39:28.480
And it's funny how my whole story
and life and this journey

39:28.480 --> 39:31.600
has all been changed by either
photographs or newspapers.

39:35.240 --> 39:40.080
But there it was. Five months
after I'd met Jackie, four months.

39:42.400 --> 39:47.160
Newly developed DNA science makes
a big splash in the crime world.

39:48.360 --> 39:50.920
Criminal convictions being reversed.

39:52.640 --> 39:56.280
People were walking out, left
and right and left and right.

39:58.040 --> 39:59.800
Whoa.

39:59.800 --> 40:03.240
I write a letter to Jackie, I cut
the article, I sent it to her.

40:03.240 --> 40:04.760
She came back on that visit.

40:07.000 --> 40:10.320
As soon as the doors closed, I said,
"I didn't kill that woman."

40:12.800 --> 40:15.720
That was the first thing I shouted.

40:15.720 --> 40:18.000
I was, like... That was the first
time I'd told her.

40:19.640 --> 40:22.400
And I was, like,
"I've got two things to tell you.

40:22.400 --> 40:24.960
"One - I didn't kill Mrs Craig.

40:24.960 --> 40:29.800
"And, two - I think
I'm in love with you, too."

40:29.800 --> 40:32.680
She was, like, "Let's handle
the first one, first."

40:32.680 --> 40:36.400
You know what I mean? Let's deal
with the difficult one first.

40:36.400 --> 40:38.320
I was, like, "Oh, man."

40:41.680 --> 40:43.600
CAR DOOR SLAMS

40:45.560 --> 40:47.520
KID SHOUTS, ENGINE STARTS

40:47.520 --> 40:48.480
ENGINE REVS

40:56.240 --> 41:00.800
In the 1970s, a lot of the vehicles
still didn't have locks

41:00.800 --> 41:03.880
on the steering column,
so you could just stick

41:03.880 --> 41:06.520
a screwdriver into the key slot

41:06.520 --> 41:09.640
and literally just turn
the ignition.

41:09.640 --> 41:14.120
So, my friend Eddie and I
used to steal the early Fords,

41:14.120 --> 41:16.320
and we would joyride them.

41:18.680 --> 41:22.160
This man knew we were
15-year-old kids,

41:22.160 --> 41:25.360
and knew that we didn't own the car,
and knew that it was stolen.

41:25.360 --> 41:27.800
He was, like, "Come here, I'll give
you $200 for the car."

41:27.800 --> 41:30.320
We looked at each other, and $200
was, like, an enormous

41:30.320 --> 41:32.560
amount of money. We figured
we just hit the jackpot.

41:32.560 --> 41:37.280
We knew he owned a collision centre
that fixed and repaired cars.

41:37.280 --> 41:39.880
So we said,
"Can we get you another car?"

41:39.880 --> 41:44.560
And he told us what one
he would need, when he needed it,

41:44.560 --> 41:46.680
and we'd go out and look for it.

41:46.680 --> 41:49.040
PLANE FLIES OVERHEAD

41:49.040 --> 41:51.120
ENGINE TURNS OVER

41:51.120 --> 41:52.840
ENGINE STARTS

41:52.840 --> 41:56.640
So, usually, my friends and I would
go to the Philadelphia airport

41:56.640 --> 41:58.880
and wait for what we called vics...

41:58.880 --> 42:01.480
TYRES SCREECH

42:01.480 --> 42:03.960
..which was somebody who walked up,

42:03.960 --> 42:06.800
took their luggage
out of the rear of the car,

42:06.800 --> 42:10.320
and then walked inside with
the family members to see them off.

42:12.000 --> 42:14.240
And never got a car
when they came out.

42:16.280 --> 42:19.720
I've had several people
in the rear-view mirror

42:19.720 --> 42:23.960
chasing behind you
as you drove off with their car.

42:26.520 --> 42:29.120
You dropped the car off,
you got $200-$300.

42:29.120 --> 42:32.080
And then you took that money
and you bought drugs.

42:32.080 --> 42:35.120
And by the time I was 17,
I was really,

42:35.120 --> 42:38.160
really getting hooked
on methamphetamine.

42:38.160 --> 42:40.800
My favourite vein was right
there on the outside.

42:42.640 --> 42:45.480
I can still feel
the hole in my arm.

42:45.480 --> 42:48.320
I can still taste
the drug in my mouth.

42:48.320 --> 42:51.920
When you inject
methamphetamine into your arm,

42:51.920 --> 42:55.560
you get the burning numbing
sensation shoot up your arm,

42:55.560 --> 42:58.480
and then you get
the taste of...

42:58.480 --> 43:00.560
ethanol in your mouth.

43:01.920 --> 43:03.480
And it's like a cough...

43:03.480 --> 43:05.280
HE BLOWS

43:05.280 --> 43:07.040
..just like that.

43:09.640 --> 43:11.640
And then the other Nicky came out.

43:14.520 --> 43:17.440
The one I didn't
cringe in the mirror from.

43:17.440 --> 43:19.680
The one who wasn't weak.

43:19.680 --> 43:22.160
The one who wasn't afraid.

43:24.680 --> 43:28.200
CHILD PANTS

43:55.200 --> 43:58.960
'I wasn't just hooked on one drug.'

44:00.360 --> 44:03.440
I was a mess of multiple drugs.

44:03.440 --> 44:05.320
And alcohol.

44:06.560 --> 44:08.520
And by December 20th,

44:08.520 --> 44:12.120
I had already been homeless on the
streets for about most of that year.

44:13.960 --> 44:18.920
And that's when I stole
two cars in a row for $500 each,

44:18.920 --> 44:21.160
and I went out,
started partying again.

44:22.600 --> 44:26.040
I was on the binge.
Burning it, they called it.

44:30.320 --> 44:35.640
Every time I think of that night,
I smell wet, burning leaves.

44:38.000 --> 44:39.560
It's almost sweet.

44:41.680 --> 44:45.640
I was driving around
in another stolen car.

44:47.160 --> 44:50.600
LOUD FUNK MUSIC PLAYS

44:51.960 --> 44:53.560
The radio was blasting.

44:53.560 --> 44:55.200
POLICE SIREN BLARES

44:55.200 --> 44:57.520
You must have heard
the radio before you saw me.

45:01.000 --> 45:04.200
When he flew out,
I knew he was going to stop me.

45:04.200 --> 45:07.520
I just...
I just felt it coming right at me.

45:10.160 --> 45:12.120
And...the adrenaline.

45:12.120 --> 45:14.400
HE POUNDS HIS CHEST WITH HIS FIST

45:18.120 --> 45:20.240
His hand's on the butt of his gun.

45:23.520 --> 45:27.000
Here he comes. Now, I'm like,
"Oh, I can't stop it."

45:27.000 --> 45:28.680
HE GULPS

45:30.840 --> 45:33.520
Shit... I can't do anything.

45:35.280 --> 45:38.200
I remember, like,
looking just like that.

45:39.200 --> 45:41.320
HE MIMES

45:41.320 --> 45:44.560
I don't understand whatever he's
saying. His hand's going.

45:44.560 --> 45:46.480
HE MIMES

45:48.200 --> 45:53.160
The door pops, and the vacuum now,
when the door comes open,

45:53.160 --> 45:55.760
and there's all that
quiet on the street, and the noise

45:55.760 --> 45:57.840
on the radio's still going...
IMITATES GUITAR

45:57.840 --> 46:00.400
..that's when I realised
the radio was still on.

46:00.400 --> 46:03.400
LOUD MUSIC PLAYS

46:03.400 --> 46:07.160
"You didn't stop for the light.
Didn't you see the stop sign?"

46:07.160 --> 46:10.960
All those things, but...
I panicked, you know?

46:12.480 --> 46:15.160
Like, I remember I did that.
Like, stand-up.

46:15.160 --> 46:18.920
He was, like, right
against my throat with his forearm.

46:18.920 --> 46:22.960
Bang! Against the car.
When he shoved me back like that,

46:22.960 --> 46:25.720
I remember, like, coming up
with my left arm.

46:25.720 --> 46:28.720
And it was, like, gone,
right for the stick,

46:28.720 --> 46:32.360
and I just followed it along,
grabbed his arm.

46:32.360 --> 46:34.120
He had the stick come out,

46:34.120 --> 46:37.280
I took it right out,
like it was nothing.

46:38.520 --> 46:40.320
Right out of his hand.

46:40.320 --> 46:43.880
He was furious! And that's
when the right-hand came out.

46:43.880 --> 46:46.160
I saw that gun.

46:46.160 --> 46:50.240
I grabbed it. I reached out,
I pushed his arm straight down.

46:50.240 --> 46:53.360
Then you felt the percussion
of the blast.

46:53.360 --> 46:54.840
And then you heard the pop.

46:54.840 --> 46:56.520
GUNSHOT

46:56.520 --> 46:59.440
"OK! OK! OK!"

46:59.440 --> 47:03.080
He stuck the gun right there.
He said, "You son of a bitch!

47:03.080 --> 47:05.920
"You almost got us killed!"
He was, like, "Get in the car!"

47:05.920 --> 47:09.760
And he slammed me in the back,
in the cage area, shut the door.

47:09.760 --> 47:12.680
"Shots fired, officer assist."

47:12.680 --> 47:16.080
I remember just...
He said it four times.

47:19.680 --> 47:22.880
I remember,
I was just sitting there, like this.

47:25.400 --> 47:27.640
What the hell happened?

47:27.640 --> 47:29.480
KEYS RATTLE

47:29.480 --> 47:31.560
HEAVY DOOR CLOSES

47:32.520 --> 47:35.560
They threw me in the intake unit.

47:37.160 --> 47:38.800
And I crashed.

47:40.000 --> 47:42.400
I must have slept at least 16 hours.

47:42.400 --> 47:44.600
HEAVY DOOR OPENS

47:51.520 --> 47:54.640
I was so scared. They pulled me out.

47:56.280 --> 48:00.280
I'd been arrested enough to know
this one's scary, this is serious.

48:00.280 --> 48:01.560
This one's bad.

48:03.640 --> 48:08.880
And the public defender was this
young kid, and he turned to me.

48:08.880 --> 48:10.400
He said, "Look, Mr Yarris,

48:10.400 --> 48:12.920
"do you understand the serious
nature of these charges,

48:12.920 --> 48:15.120
"because if you're convicted of
these charges,

48:15.120 --> 48:16.480
"you face life imprisonment."

48:16.480 --> 48:19.400
I said, "What's my charges?"
He said,

48:19.400 --> 48:22.080
"Kidnapping of police officer.

48:22.080 --> 48:24.440
"Attempted murder
of a police officer.

48:24.440 --> 48:27.960
"Reckless endangerment,
possession of a firearm,

48:27.960 --> 48:30.800
"robbery, resisting arrest,

48:30.800 --> 48:33.120
"possession of a stolen vehicle."

48:34.880 --> 48:36.360
I started crying.

48:40.400 --> 48:45.240
They take me back to the cell,
and there was the newspaper.

48:47.520 --> 48:52.920
The December 16th
Delaware County Daily Times.

48:56.160 --> 49:00.240
The front page was missing, so
the front page on it was page three.

49:04.680 --> 49:09.320
And right there was
the story of Linda Mae Craig.

49:21.880 --> 49:24.240
I swear...

49:24.240 --> 49:26.960
something about that
newspaper kept calling me.

49:40.760 --> 49:47.800
On December 15th, 1981, at 4:05pm,
Linda Mae Craig left work.

49:49.240 --> 49:52.200
She was knocked out of her shoes
in the car park

49:52.200 --> 49:56.520
of the Tri-State Mall,
dragged into a car that she owned,

49:56.520 --> 49:58.800
and then driven into
the state of Pennsylvania,

49:58.800 --> 50:00.800
about two-and-a-half miles away,

50:00.800 --> 50:03.760
where she was taken
behind a church...

50:05.280 --> 50:09.600
..where she was stabbed after being
raped, and dumped in the car park.

50:13.240 --> 50:16.280
The next morning, two children...

50:17.400 --> 50:19.080
..walked up to what they thought

50:19.080 --> 50:22.920
was a mannequin that had been
covered in the newly fallen snow.

50:25.000 --> 50:29.840
One of the boys walked up, and
kicked the snow from the face

50:29.840 --> 50:32.560
of the mannequin, so that
they could see if it was

50:32.560 --> 50:34.040
a boy or a girl mannequin...

50:35.520 --> 50:39.640
..only to discover
the disfigured face of Mrs Craig.

50:48.120 --> 50:50.960
I lived 20-something
miles from the murder scene.

50:50.960 --> 50:55.840
And I said, "Man, if I had
knowledge about a crime this big...

50:57.440 --> 51:00.520
"..I can get out of this.
I bet you they would let me out

51:00.520 --> 51:03.400
"and then I could get out
on bail and I'd run."

51:03.400 --> 51:05.560
Like the stupid mind of a child.

51:07.240 --> 51:09.040
So I sat in my cell.

51:09.040 --> 51:11.280
And I started making up a story.

51:11.280 --> 51:13.120
And I said I would tell 'em...

51:13.120 --> 51:15.760
that somebody did the murder, right?

51:15.760 --> 51:18.120
And then I had to find out
who I could blame.

51:18.120 --> 51:20.360
And the only one I could
think of was Jimmy.

51:24.080 --> 51:29.200
I had met Jimmy Brisbois
in 1980, when I was doing drugs.

51:29.200 --> 51:33.280
And I stole some coins from a car
that I'd gotten from the airport.

51:34.640 --> 51:37.720
1,000 coins? There was
a lot of coins in this big bag.

51:39.080 --> 51:42.960
I made the mistake of showing Jimmy,
and, out of nowhere,

51:42.960 --> 51:47.000
his friend hit me
with this 357 Magnum.

51:47.000 --> 51:48.240
THUMP

51:48.240 --> 51:52.640
I've still got a chip out of my
eyebrow that I can rub at this time.

51:52.640 --> 51:54.200
TYRES SCREECH

51:55.720 --> 51:58.800
And they had an old carpet
in the front room that nobody

51:58.800 --> 52:01.840
used in this house we were
living in on Woodland Avenue.

52:01.840 --> 52:04.600
So, rolled me up in the rug,

52:04.600 --> 52:07.240
threw me into this pick-up truck
that Jimmy had,

52:07.240 --> 52:10.440
and they took me behind
the Westing House warehouse.

52:10.440 --> 52:13.560
And I heard the spliff - PEW! -
like that.

52:13.560 --> 52:17.560
One of them took a 22-calibre pistol
and shot the rug.

52:17.560 --> 52:20.160
But being drug addict
idiots that they were,

52:20.160 --> 52:22.840
they shot it where the folded part
over of the rug was,

52:22.840 --> 52:26.280
about two feet above my head,
way out of range of anywhere I was.

52:28.200 --> 52:29.800
I was enraged.

52:31.480 --> 52:33.120
I went looking for Jimmy.

52:34.360 --> 52:36.880
"Hey, Michael, what happened
to your buddy, Jimmy?"

52:36.880 --> 52:38.960
Cos he knew Jimmy.

52:38.960 --> 52:41.080
"So, what happened to your
old rat-bastard Jimmy?

52:41.080 --> 52:43.880
"I ain't seen him for a while." And
that's when he told me the story.

52:43.880 --> 52:47.400
Jimmy and his friends were over
in Jersey. Jimmy had an overdose.

52:47.400 --> 52:50.400
They weren't taking him to
the hospital to get arrested,

52:50.400 --> 52:53.080
so they dumped him,
stole his drugs, and he's dead.

52:53.080 --> 52:55.360
So you don't have to
look for him no more.

53:00.520 --> 53:04.480
All I wanted them to do
was lower my bail enough that

53:04.480 --> 53:08.520
I was allowed out temporarily,
at which time I could abscond.

53:09.960 --> 53:12.760
Jimmy was dead, they were going to
find out eventually, right?

53:15.320 --> 53:17.480
They took me to the warden's office.

53:17.480 --> 53:20.360
They brought me in, took my
handcuffs off, the warden goes,

53:20.360 --> 53:22.840
"Hey, get him a drink, man.
Get him a cold drink."

53:22.840 --> 53:24.720
So they went out
and got me a Coca-Cola.

53:24.720 --> 53:27.720
I'm sitting in a lounge chair,
no longer in a prison setting, like.

53:27.720 --> 53:30.320
And I'm sitting there,
and he's got my file.

53:30.320 --> 53:33.440
He's, like, "Oh, man,
you're a young guy.

53:33.440 --> 53:35.200
"What are you charged
with all this for?

53:35.200 --> 53:38.280
"You don't have any violence on your
record. What's this bullshit?

53:38.280 --> 53:40.760
"Attempted murder? That doesn't
sound like you, Nick.

53:40.760 --> 53:42.600
"You're a car thief.
What's going on here?"

53:45.520 --> 53:47.520
I tell him my story.

53:49.440 --> 53:52.880
Like a proud parent,
everyone's praising me.

53:52.880 --> 53:54.480
In just a few hours,

53:54.480 --> 53:58.440
I went from sitting there with
$100,000 bail waiting to go

53:58.440 --> 54:01.560
to prison for the rest of my life
to being told

54:01.560 --> 54:04.360
I was going to have a hearing
set up next week in which

54:04.360 --> 54:07.600
I would possibly be
released on my own recognisances

54:07.600 --> 54:11.520
and my charges would be reduced to
nothing more than resisting arrest.

54:14.080 --> 54:16.920
When they found
James Brisbois alive,

54:16.920 --> 54:19.560
you could have knocked me
over with a feather.

54:21.000 --> 54:25.240
Jimmy had gotten off the drugs,
got his life together.

54:25.240 --> 54:26.920
I was screwed.

54:26.920 --> 54:29.560
When they came back to me,
they knew two things.

54:29.560 --> 54:33.000
One - James Brisbois had
nothing to do with that crime.

54:33.000 --> 54:36.640
And I had more information
than anyone else.

54:36.640 --> 54:39.560
It was all guesswork,
but it didn't matter to them.

KEYS JANGLE

54:43.760 --> 54:45.200
CELL DOOR OPENS

54:51.800 --> 54:55.440
I was charged with
the abduction, rape,

54:55.440 --> 54:58.520
and murder of a woman
I'd never met in my life.

55:02.200 --> 55:05.160
I was already sitting
in prison for the attempted murder

55:05.160 --> 55:07.720
of a police officer.

55:07.720 --> 55:11.160
I'm a 20-year-old drug addict,

55:11.160 --> 55:13.480
who's been thrown
out of his own house

55:13.480 --> 55:15.520
onto the streets by his own family.

55:17.600 --> 55:19.320
What chance do I have?

55:19.320 --> 55:21.040
No-one's going to believe me.

55:28.560 --> 55:31.240
In April,
the trial for the attempted murder

55:31.240 --> 55:34.520
and kidnapping of Officer
Benjamin Wright was to begin.

55:34.520 --> 55:37.960
By then, I had already been charged
with the murder of Linda Mae Craig,

55:37.960 --> 55:41.800
so the media was having
a field day with stalker stories

55:41.800 --> 55:44.560
and making me out to be
a complete deranged lunatic.

55:44.560 --> 55:49.400
So, my trial began
and Officer Wright testified.

55:49.400 --> 55:51.840
He got up on the stand,
and he started telling a completely

55:51.840 --> 55:53.960
different story than what
actually happened.

55:53.960 --> 55:57.480
He said that when he pulled up to
the car, I had opened the door,

55:57.480 --> 55:59.360
got out, and punched him
in the face,

55:59.360 --> 56:01.280
and knocked his glasses
off his face.

56:01.280 --> 56:03.960
He then said he was trying
to flail and defend himself

56:03.960 --> 56:06.840
while I pummelled him
a couple more times in the face,

56:06.840 --> 56:09.160
before I reached down
and grabbed his gun

56:09.160 --> 56:11.840
and took his gun from him,
and after which he said I had

56:11.840 --> 56:14.040
the gun pointed directly at his face

56:14.040 --> 56:16.960
when he heroically reached out
with both hands,

56:16.960 --> 56:19.000
and grabbed the gun,
and pulled it from me

56:19.000 --> 56:21.000
as it discharged
right next to his face.

56:23.880 --> 56:29.080
And he had a photograph of his hand
with a 2.5cm scratch on it

56:29.080 --> 56:31.400
to prove all of the things
that he said.

56:32.680 --> 56:34.280
CHAIR SCRAPES

56:34.280 --> 56:38.480
And Sam Stretton,
my defence lawyer, got up

56:38.480 --> 56:42.240
and calmly walked over
with the photograph in his hand,

56:42.240 --> 56:45.480
placed the photograph down on the
bar of the witness box

56:45.480 --> 56:47.880
in front of Officer Wright and said,

56:47.880 --> 56:51.720
"Is it your testimony that
Nicholas Yarris punched you

56:51.720 --> 56:55.800
"in the face three times,
breaking your eyeglasses,

56:55.800 --> 56:59.240
"he then took this pistol
and held it up,"

56:59.240 --> 57:01.720
and said, "Hit you
in the face with it,

57:01.720 --> 57:04.360
"like, a seven pound
metal object twice.

57:06.880 --> 57:10.160
"Why didn't you photograph
your face?"

57:10.160 --> 57:12.400
Officer Wright
knew that the jig was up.

57:12.400 --> 57:14.440
He turned and said,
"I'm a good looking man.

57:14.440 --> 57:17.000
"I didn't want the jury to see
my face all scratched up.

57:17.000 --> 57:19.760
"I don't have to show that."
He got all defiant.

57:19.760 --> 57:23.600
The jury made this snorting,
scoffing kind of noise and, like,

57:23.600 --> 57:27.440
everyone saw in that one moment
that his story was really a lie.

57:28.960 --> 57:32.920
The jury deliberated for a very
short...very, very short time,

57:32.920 --> 57:36.160
and came right back.
Not guilty of attempted murder.

57:36.160 --> 57:39.120
Not guilty of kidnapping
of a police officer.

57:39.120 --> 57:41.160
Not guilty - aggravated assault.

57:41.160 --> 57:42.720
All charges - not guilty.

57:43.880 --> 57:45.880
And then Barry Gross,
the prosecutor,

57:45.880 --> 57:49.600
who is, like, really pissed off,
he was so angry, he tells the jury,

57:49.600 --> 57:52.400
"You just let a murderer go,
you just let him go!"

57:52.400 --> 57:54.960
And the jury foreman was this
woman who stood up and said,

57:54.960 --> 57:57.600
"Excuse me, we didn't try that case.

57:57.600 --> 58:01.560
"We tried this case, and your case
stinks." And my mum said, "Yeah!

58:01.560 --> 58:03.840
"That's right,
tell him again, lady."

58:05.120 --> 58:06.640
And it was the worst thing.

58:07.680 --> 58:08.960
Oh, my God.

58:10.840 --> 58:15.040
The very next week, Barry Gross
takes over the murder prosecution

58:15.040 --> 58:17.040
and begins seeking
the death penalty.

58:21.320 --> 58:25.160
I went from April, when I was
acquitted of all charges,

58:25.160 --> 58:28.200
to the June trial for the murder
of Mrs Craig.

58:30.320 --> 58:32.160
I was so scared.

58:37.000 --> 58:40.880
Arthur Craig, the victim's husband,
was asked to testify.

58:50.960 --> 58:53.400
Mr Craig, Mrs Craig,

58:53.400 --> 58:56.360
and their three adopted children
in a family-type setting.

58:56.360 --> 59:00.280
And the prosecutor asked Arthur
Craig, "Is that it your wife?

59:00.280 --> 59:03.120
"Can you identify the people
in the photograph?"

59:03.120 --> 59:05.040
He did, along with his wife as well.

59:05.040 --> 59:06.520

59:11.000 --> 59:14.640
..there was Mrs Craig,
laid out on the autopsy table,

59:14.640 --> 59:16.880
six stab wounds, clearly visible

59:16.880 --> 59:20.800
and her broken teeth
and everything visible.

59:20.800 --> 59:24.080
There was...a gasp, almost.

59:25.640 --> 59:27.120
People were looking away.

59:28.440 --> 59:30.000
IMITATES CLICK

59:30.000 --> 59:31.400
The next one.

59:39.000 --> 59:41.080
The photograph was white and black.

59:42.360 --> 59:47.160
But for when you got closer towards
that figure that was

59:47.160 --> 59:48.960
covered in snow...

59:48.960 --> 59:54.920
you could see the children's
footprints in white snow...

59:56.200 --> 59:57.680
..and then they scattered.

59:59.840 --> 01:00:04.280
The first steps were
dark and lighter,

01:00:04.280 --> 01:00:10.760
so you had to imagine it was
bloody...

01:00:10.760 --> 01:00:14.000
and that they must have been
horrified as they looked down

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:17.480
and saw the treads
of their own feet, blood-soaked,

01:00:17.480 --> 01:00:21.000
as they ran in different directions.

01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:25.520
And the jury...they looked
up at the screen.

01:00:25.520 --> 01:00:27.120
They looked at me.

01:00:28.160 --> 01:00:33.680
And, like uniform animals
in one of those documentaries,

01:00:33.680 --> 01:00:36.680
where they all do an alike thing,
they all went...

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:43.200
And it was the last time
any one of them could look at me.

01:00:52.200 --> 01:00:54.040
I had just turned 21.

01:00:55.760 --> 01:00:57.800
And they were going to take my life.

01:01:28.240 --> 01:01:35.120
The only science that was available
in the early '80s was blood type.

01:01:35.120 --> 01:01:37.560
That was the cutting
edge of technology

01:01:37.560 --> 01:01:39.840
as far as identifying someone.

01:01:39.840 --> 01:01:41.840
That was it.

01:01:41.840 --> 01:01:45.040
And there was no real
evidence at my trial.

01:01:45.040 --> 01:01:48.280
Not a signed confession,
not an eyewitness testimony,

01:01:48.280 --> 01:01:50.080
no murder weapon.

01:01:50.080 --> 01:01:53.760
Nothing but speculation
and circumstantial evidence.

01:01:55.760 --> 01:02:00.280
But unfortunately, I shared the
same blood group as the murderer.

01:02:00.280 --> 01:02:03.880
And at the time, that made me
a near slam dunk

01:02:03.880 --> 01:02:06.360
for being probably
the person who did it.

01:02:08.480 --> 01:02:10.960
And then in February of 1988,

01:02:10.960 --> 01:02:14.280
there was this newspaper article
about DNA testing.

01:02:15.480 --> 01:02:18.480
And I'm like blown away.

01:02:18.480 --> 01:02:21.760
I can't believe I have the key
to my cell in my hands

01:02:21.760 --> 01:02:24.040
because I knew
I didn't kill that woman.

01:02:24.040 --> 01:02:27.160
I know none of my biological
materials were anywhere near her.

01:02:28.280 --> 01:02:30.440
I wrote to Joe Bullen, my lawyer,

01:02:30.440 --> 01:02:34.080
and I asked him
to begin the process of the DNA.

01:02:35.440 --> 01:02:37.400
And the phone call,
I can still recall...

01:02:39.200 --> 01:02:42.680
All week, just on pins and needles
and then Monday morning

01:02:42.680 --> 01:02:45.160
I get taken downstairs at 10:00am,
which is a bad time

01:02:45.160 --> 01:02:47.160
because they've got all
the food going.

01:02:47.160 --> 01:02:49.840
They brought in the food trucks
and they are just banging

01:02:49.840 --> 01:02:52.320
and clanging these metal
plates that they put food on

01:02:52.320 --> 01:02:55.240
and they put them in these racks
and run them up these stairs

01:02:55.240 --> 01:02:57.120
and it's just noise
and it's all going.

01:02:57.120 --> 01:02:59.000
I get a hold of the secretary first

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:02.000
and then I get hold of Joe Bullen
and he says, "I got news for you."

01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:04.600
"You've got to slow down."
I was like, "What? What?"

01:03:04.600 --> 01:03:07.960
He says, "The coroner
has explained to me

01:03:07.960 --> 01:03:11.040
"that they've lost all
the autopsy material."

01:03:13.560 --> 01:03:16.440
And there was just
banging and yelling.

01:03:16.440 --> 01:03:18.400
I didn't hear them.

01:03:18.400 --> 01:03:21.720
I was like, "Slow down.
Say that again. What do you mean?"

01:03:21.720 --> 01:03:24.960
I wanted to turn around and just
shout, "Just please shut up!"

01:03:24.960 --> 01:03:27.200
I knew that would get
my ass whooped.

01:03:27.200 --> 01:03:29.680
So I just stood there shaking
with the phone in my hand

01:03:29.680 --> 01:03:32.160
and I said, "What do you mean
the autopsy materials?

01:03:32.160 --> 01:03:35.320
"That's the stuff they used at my
trial, the evidence at my trial.

01:03:35.320 --> 01:03:37.160
"Is that what you are
trying to tell me?

01:03:37.160 --> 01:03:40.480
"All the evidence
at my trial has been thrown away?

01:03:40.480 --> 01:03:43.040
"How am I still on death row
if after the trial..."

01:03:43.040 --> 01:03:47.320
And I start talking like this
and he's yelling into the phone.

01:03:47.320 --> 01:03:51.000
"I said, shut up for a minute
and I'll tell you."

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:54.080
And then in this very
supercilious voice,

01:03:54.080 --> 01:03:58.080
he said, "The coroner's office
has looked all week

01:03:58.080 --> 01:04:03.120
"and I just got off the phone with
them at 9:28am and he's informed me

01:04:03.120 --> 01:04:07.560
"that they've lost all the autopsy
material from the Linda Mae..."

01:04:07.560 --> 01:04:10.680
And he's reading from something,
like his notes or his crib notes

01:04:10.680 --> 01:04:13.480
of what this conversation was
and it was very deadpan.

01:04:13.480 --> 01:04:15.480
I started getting angry
and I said,

01:04:15.480 --> 01:04:18.320
"Do you remember when you came
to first visit me?

01:04:18.320 --> 01:04:21.760
"You told me I was guilty because
of all the overwhelming evidence.

01:04:21.760 --> 01:04:25.080
"Well, where's all the overwhelming
evidence when I want DNA, Joe?"

01:04:26.520 --> 01:04:28.360
And he hung up.

01:04:31.800 --> 01:04:35.240
I go back up in my cell
and I'm furious.

01:04:35.240 --> 01:04:38.680
I wanted to kill somebody.
I was so angry.

01:04:42.040 --> 01:04:44.360
I was out of visits for the month.

01:04:44.360 --> 01:04:48.440
That meant I had to wait
until March to see Jackie again

01:04:48.440 --> 01:04:52.480
and explain to her that
the evidence was lost and...

01:04:54.120 --> 01:04:55.920
..we had no hope.

01:05:01.840 --> 01:05:03.520
So, erm...

01:05:05.720 --> 01:05:09.120
I went, like, completely blank.

01:05:12.960 --> 01:05:17.080
But then after a while,
I started to think,

01:05:17.080 --> 01:05:21.000
that's not possible because
at my trial they went on and on

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:24.400
about how the killer had
B positive blood, didn't he?

01:05:25.640 --> 01:05:29.000
And, like, I said to myself, wait
a minute, who did the test on that?

01:05:30.320 --> 01:05:33.480
So I started reading the trial
transcripts and I found out

01:05:33.480 --> 01:05:36.440
some material was sent to a
laboratory at the time of my trial.

01:05:36.440 --> 01:05:39.920
I wrote to the lab director
and he wrote me back and he said,

01:05:39.920 --> 01:05:42.680
"Dear Mr Yarris,
I have searched my files

01:05:42.680 --> 01:05:47.160
"and we do have two preparations
that are unstained

01:05:47.160 --> 01:05:51.000
and they have high weight
visible DNA from the sperm."

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:53.160
And I was like, oh, my God.

01:05:53.160 --> 01:05:57.200
This DNA works,
I not only can prove my innocence

01:05:57.200 --> 01:05:59.680
but I can be out of here
in a few years.

01:06:01.240 --> 01:06:04.240
And it was like opening up
this flood gate to this woman.

01:06:04.240 --> 01:06:06.080
Jackie.

01:06:07.960 --> 01:06:10.360
I married her on July 1, 1988,

01:06:10.360 --> 01:06:14.000
six years to the day
that I was sentenced to die.

01:06:17.360 --> 01:06:19.800
I was so in love.

01:06:19.800 --> 01:06:23.440
Oh, my God.

01:06:26.360 --> 01:06:31.840
Like, I was into this thing
where music was beautiful.

01:06:31.840 --> 01:06:36.120
If it rained outside and I caught
the smell of it through my window,

01:06:36.120 --> 01:06:39.960
even though I couldn't actually
see the rain, it was beautiful.

01:06:39.960 --> 01:06:43.440
Like, every little nuance
in life was magical.

01:06:45.040 --> 01:06:48.120
And I loved this person
in my life so much.

01:06:48.120 --> 01:06:51.760
And I was like offering this
person not only hope

01:06:51.760 --> 01:06:54.640
that I could prove myself innocent
and get off death row,

01:06:54.640 --> 01:06:57.720
but I could be home
and we could begin a life.

01:07:11.920 --> 01:07:14.440
And then one year became two.

01:07:14.440 --> 01:07:15.880
And three.

01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:21.280
It took us five years
to get to the DNA test.

01:07:22.840 --> 01:07:24.800
And the results came back
inconclusive.

01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:29.360
Inconclusive results
due to degradation.

01:07:40.440 --> 01:07:44.000
But then, in a miracle of miracles,
the victim's clothing

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:48.400
was located in a clerk's
office at the courthouse.

01:07:51.480 --> 01:07:54.520
My mother had recoiled in horror
at the end of my trial

01:07:54.520 --> 01:07:58.560
when my parents were almost
accidentally given a box
marked "Yarris"

01:07:58.560 --> 01:08:02.520
and inside of it was the
victim's blood soaked clothing.

01:08:02.520 --> 01:08:05.040
And she remembered that
and she told the custodian,

01:08:05.040 --> 01:08:08.160
"Don't you remember how you almost
gave me the victim's clothing?"

01:08:08.160 --> 01:08:10.240
And he said, "Oh, that's right."

01:08:10.240 --> 01:08:13.400
And he went off
and found the victim's clothing.

01:08:16.200 --> 01:08:20.160
Those clothes yielded sperm
from the victim's underwear

01:08:20.160 --> 01:08:23.600
and it was high weight
and there was a lot of it.

01:08:25.279 --> 01:08:27.640
Cuttings were placed
into these tubes

01:08:27.640 --> 01:08:31.520
and then they were sent to
Germantown, Maryland, for keeping.

01:08:31.520 --> 01:08:37.720
It took me from 1993 to 1997
to finally get court approval

01:08:37.720 --> 01:08:42.160
for the foremost authority of DNA
in America to do the DNA testing.

01:08:42.160 --> 01:08:44.439
Hallelujah! I got Dr Blake.

01:08:44.439 --> 01:08:46.640
He already did the OJ Simpson case,

01:08:46.640 --> 01:08:48.600
he's very famous,
very well respected.

01:08:48.600 --> 01:08:50.160
He's the man.

01:08:55.319 --> 01:08:59.359
They take the new evidence
and they send it down to California.

01:08:59.359 --> 01:09:04.080
And they improperly package it
and it burst open in transit.

01:09:06.640 --> 01:09:08.800
And Dr Blake says,
"We're not going to test it.

01:09:08.800 --> 01:09:10.880
"All it would do is produce results

01:09:10.880 --> 01:09:13.120
"that would be contested
by the prosecution.

01:09:13.120 --> 01:09:14.760
"I'm not going to test it."

01:09:14.760 --> 01:09:16.800
And he just put it on a shelf.

01:09:19.240 --> 01:09:22.160
It killed a part of my marriage
and it killed a part of Jackie

01:09:22.160 --> 01:09:23.920
and it killed a part of me.

01:09:26.439 --> 01:09:30.800
She fought with me for nine years
to get DNA

01:09:30.800 --> 01:09:33.720
and she just said,
"Nicky, I can't do this any more."

01:09:36.279 --> 01:09:38.359
I said, "Man, go."

01:09:44.240 --> 01:09:47.160
I went back to my cell and I was
just sitting there by the window

01:09:47.160 --> 01:09:49.520
listening to the radio
and this song came on.

01:09:49.520 --> 01:09:51.680
I was listening to the lyrics,
you know.

01:09:53.279 --> 01:09:55.520
"They say that you're leaving.

01:09:55.520 --> 01:09:57.840
"It comes as no surprise.

01:09:57.840 --> 01:10:00.920
"And still I like this
feeling of being left behind."

01:10:04.120 --> 01:10:06.440
I was listening to the lyrics
and I was thinking...

01:10:07.640 --> 01:10:09.600
You always do that to me.

01:10:09.600 --> 01:10:12.520
You always torment me
with words from someone else's song

01:10:12.520 --> 01:10:14.480
and suddenly they're my words.

01:10:14.480 --> 01:10:16.480
and they are ingrained
in my thoughts.

01:10:20.680 --> 01:10:23.920
Even though I was being told
they were leaving,

01:10:23.920 --> 01:10:27.640
I still kind of liked that
feeling of being left behind.

01:10:30.160 --> 01:10:34.200
It's a strange phenomenon
when you felt good for their leaving

01:10:34.200 --> 01:10:38.520
because you knew all along you had
stolen a lot of their life away.

01:10:38.520 --> 01:10:42.560
# It's just like going home. #

01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:46.640
On a December night,
on a snowing night,

01:10:46.640 --> 01:10:50.640
just like the lyrics said,
I just started writing this letter.

01:10:53.320 --> 01:10:55.880
I wasn't crying
or upset or anything.

01:10:55.880 --> 01:11:01.120
I simply sat down and tried
to tell somebody why I loved them

01:11:01.120 --> 01:11:05.480
and why saying goodbye to them
was this wonderful gift.

01:11:05.480 --> 01:11:08.720
I knew she didn't have
to fight for me any more.

01:11:08.720 --> 01:11:11.760
I knew she didn't have to make
copies of my legal documents

01:11:11.760 --> 01:11:15.920
and send them back to me,
call lawyers, chase up new DNA.

01:11:15.920 --> 01:11:19.760
She didn't have to go and chase up
my mum or any of these other things.

01:11:19.760 --> 01:11:21.760
She could just be free.

01:11:21.760 --> 01:11:23.720
One of us.

01:11:31.120 --> 01:11:32.880
You see, at the end,

01:11:32.880 --> 01:11:35.720
that wonderful gift that
was given to me for so long,

01:11:35.720 --> 01:11:39.600
I didn't cling, trying to hold
on to what wasn't mine anyway

01:11:39.600 --> 01:11:41.320
because it was a gift.

01:11:41.320 --> 01:11:43.440
It was like a ten year
confirmation

01:11:43.440 --> 01:11:45.800
that I was becoming that person
that I liked.

01:11:45.800 --> 01:11:47.600
I was so proud of that.

01:11:49.360 --> 01:11:51.280
I woke up to a different person.

01:12:06.400 --> 01:12:10.600
By now,
I had been in prison for 18 years.

01:12:10.600 --> 01:12:13.120
And that's when I got sick.

01:12:13.120 --> 01:12:16.120
I lost 31 pounds in a month
and a half.

01:12:16.120 --> 01:12:19.200
I was really feeling poorly
and then I had blood work done

01:12:19.200 --> 01:12:21.160
and they told me what it was.

01:12:21.160 --> 01:12:24.360
I'm infected with this strain
of hepatitis C

01:12:24.360 --> 01:12:27.720
that all the men who had dental work
at Huntington had contracted.

01:12:29.240 --> 01:12:33.000
15 other men had got this hepatitis.

01:12:35.480 --> 01:12:40.440
So the first guy to die
was DC, Dale Carter.

01:12:40.440 --> 01:12:43.760
He died in the vents underneath me
screaming in agony.

01:12:43.760 --> 01:12:45.440
Oh, my God.

01:12:45.440 --> 01:12:47.840
So when I found out
I immediately said

01:12:47.840 --> 01:12:50.680
"Yes, I'll take the drug treatments.
I'll sign up for it."

01:12:50.680 --> 01:12:53.920
But the years of drug abuse
had damaged my kidneys

01:12:53.920 --> 01:12:57.200
and after about seven months
I started suffering

01:12:57.200 --> 01:12:59.720
all the side effects of this drug.

01:12:59.720 --> 01:13:03.400
I was peeing this horrible
coffee-coloured urine.

01:13:05.280 --> 01:13:07.560
Everything tasted dead in my mouth.

01:13:07.560 --> 01:13:09.720
I was just not right.

01:13:13.480 --> 01:13:15.880
And then it was August.

01:13:15.880 --> 01:13:18.080
I was out in the exercise yard.

01:13:19.320 --> 01:13:20.840
I was so weak.

01:13:22.360 --> 01:13:24.400
I was looking directly up
at the sky.

01:13:26.120 --> 01:13:28.320
And then...

01:13:28.320 --> 01:13:30.920
I couldn't see anything.
It went blank.

01:13:32.920 --> 01:13:37.000
I knew what darkness is,
but this was black.

01:13:40.800 --> 01:13:43.040
And that's when I found out
I was dying.

01:13:47.480 --> 01:13:49.360
I was so afraid that...

01:13:49.360 --> 01:13:51.520
I was shaking. I really was.

01:13:53.040 --> 01:13:57.120
And so I remember
I stuck to my ritual.

01:13:57.120 --> 01:14:00.160
I stood over the top of the
toilet bowl and I bathed

01:14:00.160 --> 01:14:04.120
and I was doing the same ritual,
bathing, three days later

01:14:04.120 --> 01:14:06.040
and I saw these swirls
around my thighs

01:14:06.040 --> 01:14:08.640
and I realised I was seeing swirls.

01:14:08.640 --> 01:14:11.720
So if I was seeing swirls,
then I was seeing.

01:14:15.360 --> 01:14:16.560
OK.

01:14:17.640 --> 01:14:20.440
The very first thing
I did later on that evening

01:14:20.440 --> 01:14:23.320
was I sat by a very bright
light at my desk

01:14:23.320 --> 01:14:25.840
and I wrote a letter to the judge
handling my appeals.

01:14:28.520 --> 01:14:31.560
And another song, Patty Griffin's
"Gonna Let Him Fly".

01:14:33.800 --> 01:14:36.760
It's so strange because the lyrics
are obviously a love song,

01:14:36.760 --> 01:14:38.920
but to me it was all about me.

01:14:38.920 --> 01:14:40.720
"Ain't no talking to this man.

01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:43.840
"Ain't no pretty other side."

01:14:47.680 --> 01:14:49.400
It's so true.

01:14:51.120 --> 01:14:54.400
There was absolutely no pretty side
to hope for any more.

01:14:55.640 --> 01:14:59.080
No Jackies, no love, none of those
things that you could have

01:14:59.080 --> 01:15:01.120
a pretty other side to hope for.

01:15:01.120 --> 01:15:03.720
# Ain't no talking to this man

01:15:05.160 --> 01:15:07.040
# Ain't no pretty other side

01:15:08.960 --> 01:15:12.480
# Ain't no way to understand

01:15:13.800 --> 01:15:16.120
# The stupid words of pride

01:15:17.800 --> 01:15:20.520
# It would take an acrobat

01:15:21.800 --> 01:15:23.760
# I already tried all that

01:15:25.120 --> 01:15:27.600
# So I'm gonna let him fly

01:15:29.320 --> 01:15:31.280
# I'm gonna let him fly

01:15:33.080 --> 01:15:36.000
# Things can move at such a pace

01:15:37.320 --> 01:15:40.240
# The second hand
just waved goodbye. #

01:15:41.640 --> 01:15:45.120
"Dear Judge Giles,
as a criminal plaintiff

01:15:45.120 --> 01:15:49.680
"I ask that one right
that I have remaining to me

01:15:49.680 --> 01:15:53.360
"as a condemned prisoner
be recognised.

01:15:53.360 --> 01:15:56.600
"And that is a condemned man's
right to be executed."

01:15:58.160 --> 01:16:00.520
# I'm gonna let him fly. #

01:16:00.520 --> 01:16:04.400
"I hereby ask that
counsel be dismissed,

01:16:04.400 --> 01:16:09.080
"that my record be then transmitted
to Governor Edward Rendell

01:16:09.080 --> 01:16:11.360
"for my execution date to be set

01:16:11.360 --> 01:16:14.360
"within 60 days
of receipt of this letter."

01:16:14.360 --> 01:16:17.040
# Took a while to understand

01:16:18.200 --> 01:16:20.960
# The beauty of just letting go. #

01:16:22.280 --> 01:16:26.040
"I hereby swear that I am sane
at the time of this writing.

01:16:26.040 --> 01:16:28.920
# I've already tried all that. #

01:16:28.920 --> 01:16:31.000
"Signed, Nicholas James Yarris.

01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:34.080
"August 2002."

01:16:35.800 --> 01:16:38.200
# Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh

01:16:38.200 --> 01:16:41.040
# I'm gonna let him fly

01:16:41.040 --> 01:16:43.040
# Fly

01:16:43.040 --> 01:16:46.200
# Yeah

01:16:46.200 --> 01:16:52.120
# I'm gonna let him fly. #

01:17:01.320 --> 01:17:04.200
When the letter was
received by Judge Giles,

01:17:04.200 --> 01:17:08.480
he ordered that my lawyers
come to a conference hearing

01:17:08.480 --> 01:17:13.120
and he wanted to know why someone
who had been asking

01:17:13.120 --> 01:17:17.080
for DNA testing for 15 years
claiming that they are innocent

01:17:17.080 --> 01:17:19.400
would now ask to be executed?

01:17:19.400 --> 01:17:21.440
And he was really hard pressed

01:17:21.440 --> 01:17:24.120
to get them to give up any answer
I guess,

01:17:24.120 --> 01:17:26.320
because I didn't copy them in
on the letter

01:17:26.320 --> 01:17:28.760
and they didn't even
know I wrote to the judge

01:17:28.760 --> 01:17:31.040
so they were hearing
this for the first time.

01:17:31.040 --> 01:17:34.480
So the judge, by law, really was
hamstrung in the fact

01:17:34.480 --> 01:17:38.440
that he was going to be required to
transmit my record to the governor

01:17:38.440 --> 01:17:40.600
as law required for me
to be executed

01:17:40.600 --> 01:17:43.200
within 60 days from that point.

01:17:43.200 --> 01:17:44.880
Instead he said,

01:17:44.880 --> 01:17:47.800
"All right, whatever DNA testing
is remaining in this case

01:17:47.800 --> 01:17:50.400
"I'm ordering it now tested."

01:17:50.400 --> 01:17:52.320
And that was April.

01:17:53.720 --> 01:17:56.520
April turned to May.
May turned to June.

01:17:58.080 --> 01:18:01.120
July 2nd, 2003.

01:18:02.200 --> 01:18:04.280
I wasn't expecting the results.

01:18:04.280 --> 01:18:07.000
For some reason, when he brought
the phone to my cell,

01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:10.760
I really wasn't expecting to talk
to my lawyers about Dr Blake.

01:18:10.760 --> 01:18:13.920
But he gave me the phone and said,
"Your lawyer wants you to call."

01:18:13.920 --> 01:18:15.880
So I dialled the number

01:18:15.880 --> 01:18:19.240
and I'm waiting for the collect
phone call process to ring through

01:18:19.240 --> 01:18:21.960
and it does and on the other end
was Michael Wiseman,

01:18:21.960 --> 01:18:24.840
a lawyer who had been
representing me for seven years.

01:18:27.120 --> 01:18:29.480
When I heard Michael Wiseman say...

01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:33.160
"I just got off the phone
with Dr Blake.

01:18:35.960 --> 01:18:39.640
"The gloves that were left inside
the victim's vehicle

01:18:39.640 --> 01:18:44.520
"were found to have DNA
from an unknown male,

01:18:44.520 --> 01:18:49.880
"DNA from Mrs Craig and DNA from the
sperm matching the killer's gloves."

01:18:49.880 --> 01:18:52.800
That was it.
I didn't have to hear anything else.

01:18:52.800 --> 01:18:54.320
I knew.

01:18:54.320 --> 01:18:57.320
You didn't have to tell Nick Yarris
what those results meant.

01:18:57.320 --> 01:18:59.440
I started screaming,
"Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

01:18:59.440 --> 01:19:01.520
"It proves me innocent!
Don't you see?!"

01:19:06.960 --> 01:19:11.040
The guard came back to collect the
phone and he saw me huddled.

01:19:12.680 --> 01:19:15.320
Crying on the bed.

01:19:15.320 --> 01:19:17.640
In the foetal position.

01:19:19.480 --> 01:19:21.000
And he said...

01:19:22.520 --> 01:19:24.920
"Nick, what's up?"

01:19:24.920 --> 01:19:29.080
And I lifted my head up
and I just shook my head

01:19:29.080 --> 01:19:32.120
because I didn't even have the
strength to say anything, you know.

01:19:34.320 --> 01:19:36.880
And he said, "Go down to the shower
and take a shower."

01:19:38.800 --> 01:19:41.040
And I got up,
I put on my shower shoes

01:19:41.040 --> 01:19:43.440
and I started trudging
towards the shower.

01:19:44.600 --> 01:19:47.920
And he opened the gate
down on the end of the block

01:19:47.920 --> 01:19:51.560
and he walked into the shower
and he put a chair in there.

01:19:51.560 --> 01:19:54.480
And as I got the last
few steps there...

01:19:56.240 --> 01:19:59.520
..he grabbed my arm gently
and he sat me down

01:19:59.520 --> 01:20:03.880
and he just pushed the button
and left me there.

01:20:05.800 --> 01:20:07.280
And I cried.

01:20:09.720 --> 01:20:13.280
I cried like you
wouldn't believe, man.

01:20:13.280 --> 01:20:15.440
I waited 15 years to cry.

01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:47.200
The happiest memory I ever had...

01:20:48.840 --> 01:20:53.520
..is that we lived
at 2439 Milan Street.

01:20:53.520 --> 01:20:55.600
Just like Italy. Milan.

01:20:58.200 --> 01:21:03.960
There was a fibreglass awning
attached to the front of our roof.

01:21:05.480 --> 01:21:09.960
And whenever it rained, it gave off
this hollow drumming sound

01:21:09.960 --> 01:21:13.560
that just drew me out of wherever
I was and whatever I was doing.

01:21:15.040 --> 01:21:17.400
And I would get a blanket

01:21:17.400 --> 01:21:20.320
and Jaco my dog, who was
a little black poodle,

01:21:20.320 --> 01:21:23.040
and we would go out
and sit on this lounge chair

01:21:23.040 --> 01:21:25.000
that was set up like a deckchair.

01:21:26.440 --> 01:21:30.040
And there, under this tattered
old green blanket

01:21:31.240 --> 01:21:33.200
I would listen to the rain

01:21:33.200 --> 01:21:37.600
and play out all these daydreams in
my head of adventures I would have.

01:21:38.960 --> 01:21:40.400
And it was like this...

01:21:41.560 --> 01:21:42.880
..cocoon.

01:21:44.240 --> 01:21:47.120
All I had was that blanket
and the dog

01:21:47.120 --> 01:21:48.760
and this...

01:21:50.600 --> 01:21:53.160
..feeling that I was on a journey.

01:22:04.960 --> 01:22:07.840
I remember as I ran out the door
with Jaco,

01:22:07.840 --> 01:22:10.720
the last thing Mum said was,

01:22:10.720 --> 01:22:14.040
"Don't you dare get
those school clothes dirty!"

01:22:17.480 --> 01:22:19.840
It was still early.
Early, like April.

01:22:20.960 --> 01:22:23.960
And in Philadelphia in the
springtime it's just beautiful.

01:22:25.640 --> 01:22:30.200
Like 67, 68 degrees and you
just get these very nice days.

01:22:31.840 --> 01:22:35.040
So Jaco and I were
just like throwing the stick

01:22:35.040 --> 01:22:37.520
and doing the things
that we loved to do.

01:22:39.960 --> 01:22:43.600
And I was walking along
deeper into the woods,

01:22:43.600 --> 01:22:45.040
when I saw him.

01:22:46.400 --> 01:22:48.000
I said, "Damn."

01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:49.760
I was so afraid of him.

01:22:53.360 --> 01:22:57.600
The hobnail boots, denim jeans,
white T-shirt,

01:22:57.600 --> 01:23:02.200
armband rolled up with a pack
of Lucky Strikes in the sleeve.

01:23:04.480 --> 01:23:06.560
And he said, "Fuck are you doing?"

01:23:06.560 --> 01:23:08.320
Like that, you know.

01:23:11.560 --> 01:23:13.120
"Take it."

01:23:14.800 --> 01:23:16.760
I looked up towards the houses.

01:23:18.120 --> 01:23:20.280
Then I went like that.
And he said, "No, puff."

01:23:20.280 --> 01:23:22.000
And I went...

01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:23.720
And I just got...

01:23:26.040 --> 01:23:30.320
My head went crazy
and I heard this sound.

01:23:30.320 --> 01:23:32.040
HE CLAPS

01:23:33.960 --> 01:23:37.440
And it was the stone that was
in his hand that he hit me with.

01:23:39.280 --> 01:23:43.360
And then I felt him
bend down and he turned me

01:23:43.360 --> 01:23:49.160
so that our shoulders were parallel
and my leg was on his arm there.

01:23:49.160 --> 01:23:51.320
And he was raping me.

01:23:51.320 --> 01:23:54.840
And he was making this, like,
guttural sound.

01:23:56.120 --> 01:23:58.640
I started, like, whimpering.

01:23:58.640 --> 01:24:01.400
He's like, "Shut the fuck up!
Shut the fuck up!

01:24:01.400 --> 01:24:04.600
"I'll fucking kill Jaco and your
whole family if you say to anybody.

01:24:04.600 --> 01:24:07.560
"You understand me? I'm not a
faggot! I'm not a fucking faggot!

01:24:07.560 --> 01:24:09.120
"You understand me?"

01:24:11.480 --> 01:24:14.080
Then he left and I screamed.

01:24:14.080 --> 01:24:16.040
I was like, "Jaco!"

01:24:17.080 --> 01:24:19.040
I kept screaming for Jaco.

01:24:23.360 --> 01:24:27.840
One of the things that he said to me
when he was putting his pants right.

01:24:30.040 --> 01:24:33.240
He looked at me and he said, "You
tell everybody you fell off a wall

01:24:33.240 --> 01:24:36.120
"with that shopping cart over there.
You hear me?"

01:24:39.240 --> 01:24:42.200
He like gave me this quick
rundown of what to say.

01:24:44.760 --> 01:24:48.360
And as soon as I told
the first lie,

01:24:48.360 --> 01:24:52.880
it was like once it was believed,
it was so hard to undo.

01:24:54.400 --> 01:24:55.840
It spiralled.

01:24:57.680 --> 01:24:59.680
And then...

01:24:59.680 --> 01:25:01.360
..everything changed.

01:25:15.280 --> 01:25:19.520
From that day I found out
I was proven innocent from science,

01:25:19.520 --> 01:25:22.880
it still took me seven more months.

01:25:22.880 --> 01:25:25.240
I went back to death row

01:25:25.240 --> 01:25:29.000
and I found out they took everything
out of my death row cell

01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:31.560
and then they took me to this unit.

01:25:33.240 --> 01:25:37.600
I was beside myself. They took me
to H block, the mental ward.

01:25:38.720 --> 01:25:41.760
"What are you doing to me?"
I didn't understand.

01:25:41.760 --> 01:25:45.400
I went over and I saw Major Locket,
the major of the guards.

01:25:45.400 --> 01:25:48.680
I said, "What's going on?
Why am I here?"

01:25:48.680 --> 01:25:54.280
And he said, "Mr Yarris, after
the experience that you had

01:25:54.280 --> 01:25:57.120
"we don't want to risk
any of the staff

01:25:57.120 --> 01:26:00.040
"being murdered by you in a rage

01:26:00.040 --> 01:26:02.960
"in recognition for what
we have done to you."

01:26:07.080 --> 01:26:08.800
I went back to my cell.

01:26:10.160 --> 01:26:13.640
And I had a plastic milk carton
and that was it.

01:26:13.640 --> 01:26:17.080
A plastic mattress,
two sheets, two towels,

01:26:17.080 --> 01:26:20.760
a pillowcase for that
plastic pillow and that was it.

01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:27.200
They took every book, they took
my artwork, they took every comfort.

01:26:30.040 --> 01:26:31.720
And I sat down on my bed

01:26:33.160 --> 01:26:34.960
and I said,

01:26:36.320 --> 01:26:38.360
"Oh, my God. They did me a favour."

01:26:40.880 --> 01:26:44.280
I folded my legs,
I sat straight in my yoga position.

01:26:48.280 --> 01:26:51.520
And I started to dream of the life
I was going to have.

01:26:51.520 --> 01:26:53.400
I was going to have a great life.

01:26:53.400 --> 01:26:56.080
I'm going to meet me a girl,
I'm going to fall in love.

01:26:56.080 --> 01:27:00.560
I'm going to have a family and best
of all I'm going to be a great dad.

01:27:00.560 --> 01:27:02.800
That's what I'm going to do.

01:27:02.800 --> 01:27:05.080
If you're going to take
everything from me,

01:27:05.080 --> 01:27:08.040
OK, then instead...

01:27:10.240 --> 01:27:08.040
I think I'll give myself everything.

01:27:09.305 --> 01:27:15.198
