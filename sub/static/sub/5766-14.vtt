WEBVTT

00:01.630 --> 00:03.769
Previously on The Good Wife...
I need something on
a Dr. Randall Booth.

00:03.800 --> 00:05.267
We need to
kneecap him.

00:05.300 --> 00:06.597
He was beaten

00:06.640 --> 00:08.562
with a baseball bat.
What?

00:08.600 --> 00:10.761
And your fingerprints
were found at the scene.

00:10.810 --> 00:12.573
KALINDA;
So what'd you do With my bat?

00:12.610 --> 00:14.635
I took it.
CARY:
Blake Calamar.

00:14.680 --> 00:16.648
When he wasn't protecting
Bond & Associate interests,

00:16.680 --> 00:20.070
he was out protecting
Baltimore's biggest meth gang.

00:20.120 --> 00:23.248
If I were you,
I'd be careful.

00:23.290 --> 00:25.383
VIOLA WALSH:
76 degrees.

00:25.420 --> 00:26.785
DIANE:
How nice for you.

00:26.820 --> 00:28.185
Here, it's a balmy ten degrees,

00:28.220 --> 00:29.152
but it's going
to get chilly tonight.

00:29.190 --> 00:32.125
So, anyway, I was supposed

00:32.160 --> 00:33.752
to fly in today
for these depositions,

00:33.800 --> 00:35.222
but O'Hare is all messed up.

00:35.260 --> 00:37.194
I just need you
to carry the ball--

00:37.230 --> 00:39.460
all routine depositions,
nothing contentious.

00:39.500 --> 00:41.229
Sure. What's the case?

00:42.270 --> 00:45.262
Patric Edelstein.

00:46.310 --> 00:48.437
Get Will.

00:48.480 --> 00:50.471
You know Sleuthway.com?

00:50.510 --> 00:52.341
Uh, yes, I do.

00:52.380 --> 00:53.312
Kid's a billionaire,

00:53.350 --> 00:54.840
a Mark Zuckerberg in the making.

00:54.880 --> 00:58.088
$4.2 billion in assets.

00:58.120 --> 01:00.281
Have you been following
what's going on with this movie?

01:00.320 --> 01:02.151
The one about him?

01:02.190 --> 01:03.589
Yes, he says it's untrue.

01:03.630 --> 01:06.497
It is untrue and defamatory,
and he wants to sue.

01:06.530 --> 01:08.498
He knows how hard it is
to prove defamation?

01:08.530 --> 01:10.828
He does.

01:10.870 --> 01:13.794
He's suing because he wants
the world to know he's suing.

01:13.840 --> 01:16.308
So, what, it's a crusade?

01:16.340 --> 01:21.107
Mm, $3.2 million in billable
hours, a very lucrative one.

01:21.140 --> 01:22.300
This is

01:22.350 --> 01:23.476
a new side of you.

01:23.510 --> 01:25.740
You used to be
into Guantanamo detainees.

01:25.780 --> 01:27.839
Yeah, that was before alimony.

01:27.880 --> 01:29.245
(Diane laughs)

01:29.290 --> 01:30.780
Patric Edelstein?

01:30.820 --> 01:34.711
Yes, but she only wants
to rent us for the week.

01:34.760 --> 01:36.352
So I don't get it.

01:36.390 --> 01:38.779
He's in Silicon Valley,
the studio's in LA,

01:38.830 --> 01:41.128
and the depos are here?

01:41.160 --> 01:43.367
Viola is forum-shopping.

01:43.400 --> 01:45.265
Illinois is friendlier
to defamation.

01:45.300 --> 01:46.562
It's not friendly enough.

01:46.600 --> 01:48.192
We lost the Duke Rosco case
last year.

01:48.240 --> 01:49.639
But that's why
she thought of us.

01:49.670 --> 01:51.365
We were the ones
who got the closest.

01:51.410 --> 01:53.469
Who was the associate
on the Rosco case?

01:53.510 --> 01:54.670
Cary.

01:54.710 --> 01:55.904
Alicia, too, I think.

01:55.940 --> 01:57.441
I'll get her on it
and we'll talk later.

01:57.480 --> 01:58.606
Mm-hmm.

01:58.650 --> 01:59.674
By the way,

01:59.720 --> 02:03.542
I'm thinking
of bringing him back.

02:03.590 --> 02:05.683
Cary.
Really, how's
that work?

02:05.720 --> 02:07.256
He's burned a few too
many bridges, hasn't he?

02:07.290 --> 02:09.258
Repairable bridges,
I would think.

02:09.290 --> 02:11.224
Some bridges aren't
so easily repaired.

02:11.260 --> 02:13.558
Let's not fight, dear.
Let me think about it.

02:15.930 --> 02:17.898
Alicia, hey.

02:17.930 --> 02:19.659
Uh, sorry to bother you
at lunch,

02:19.700 --> 02:20.894
but something pretty big
came up.

02:20.940 --> 02:22.601
Can you come by my office
when you get back?

02:23.670 --> 02:26.503
Um, Will, I'm not at lunch.

02:26.540 --> 02:27.677
Someone's
In trouble.

02:27.710 --> 02:28.677
I'm so sorry.

02:28.710 --> 02:29.677
You're gone.

02:29.710 --> 02:31.177
No, no.
I completely forgot.

02:31.210 --> 02:32.848
Uh, it's just a week.
I'll be back Monday.

02:32.880 --> 02:33.676
Was there something
you needed?

02:33.720 --> 02:35.210
Uh, nothing,
some defamation suit--

02:35.250 --> 02:37.548
same as the Duke Rosco case
last year.

02:37.590 --> 02:38.614
Don't worry, I got it.

02:38.650 --> 02:39.582
Have fun. _
Where are you again?

02:39.620 --> 02:41.759
Well, right now Oregon,
but it's not for fun.

02:41.790 --> 02:42.586
Hey.

02:42.630 --> 02:45.724
I'm helping my brother
move to Chicago,

02:45.760 --> 02:47.853
so if you need
anything, I...

02:47.900 --> 02:49.265
Hello?

02:49.300 --> 02:50.824
(phone beeps)
What do you mean,

02:50.870 --> 02:51.825
it is not for fun?

02:51.870 --> 02:53.462
I was talking to work.

02:53.500 --> 02:56.901
Will, Will Gardner--
that name again, like a

02:56.940 --> 02:57.964
guilty little
computer

02:58.010 --> 03:00.376
churning out the same name,
"Will, Will, Will."

03:00.410 --> 03:01.809
He's my boss.
Oh, I know.

03:01.840 --> 03:03.444
The sultry-eyed Will.

03:03.480 --> 03:04.947
He does not have
sultry eyes.

03:04.980 --> 03:06.675
What are sultry eyes,
anyway?

03:07.680 --> 03:09.819
Oh, that's it,

03:09.850 --> 03:11.215
you caught him exactly.

03:11.250 --> 03:12.615
Hey,

03:12.660 --> 03:14.810
look, first state.
You know,

03:14.860 --> 03:16.680
you're getting less and less
subtle changing your subjects.

03:16.730 --> 03:17.924
I think we should take a minute

03:17.960 --> 03:20.520
and talk about this Will
some more.

03:20.560 --> 03:21.822
You going to miss Kevin?

03:23.430 --> 03:25.398
Nope.

03:25.430 --> 03:26.988
I like new beginnings.

03:27.040 --> 03:27.995
(sighs)

03:28.040 --> 03:30.759
But I did like Oregon.

03:30.810 --> 03:33.836
Why is it that all your music
is gospel?

03:33.880 --> 03:35.336
(turns up volume)

03:35.380 --> 03:37.678
* Victory is mine

03:37.710 --> 03:38.802
* Victory
is mine *

03:38.850 --> 03:40.408
_ Come on. _
* Victory today IS mine...

03:40.450 --> 03:42.281
(soulfully):
Come on!

03:43.320 --> 03:45.481
* I told Satan...

03:45.520 --> 03:46.487
(typing)

03:46.520 --> 03:48.454
MAN:
Mr. Edelstein?

03:48.490 --> 03:52.597
Mr. Edelstein,
are you with us?

03:52.630 --> 03:54.723
Yes. Sorry.
What was the question?

03:54.760 --> 03:56.921
You_ were_ in the midst
of discussmg damages.

03:56.970 --> 03:58.790
WILL: Actually, I think
he was in the midst

03:58.830 --> 04:00.991
of discussing
the emotional toll.

04:01.040 --> 04:03.508
EDELSTEIN: Yes, this movie--
it shows me creating

04:03.540 --> 04:05.929
my Web site so that
I could pick up girls,

04:05.970 --> 04:09.849
despite the fact that I was
engaged to be married

04:09.880 --> 04:11.472
and had no interest
in picking up girls.

04:11.510 --> 04:12.977
It shows several
of my friends

04:13.020 --> 04:15.375
referring to me
as a creep and a jerk,

04:15.420 --> 04:18.719
despite the fact
these friends were inventions,

04:18.750 --> 04:23.289
and what's worse, it shows
me... being a creep and a jerk.

04:23.330 --> 04:24.422
It would have been
one thing ifI was

04:24.460 --> 04:25.757
a politician
or a celebrity.

04:25.790 --> 04:27.951
Then people have
other portrayals and articles

04:28.000 --> 04:29.399
to compare it to,
but they don't.

04:29.430 --> 04:33.764
They have this movie
and they think it's true.

04:33.800 --> 04:36.837
Are you saying that you are not
a public figure, Mr. Edelstein?

04:36.870 --> 04:38.758
I think that's exactly...
Shall we let

04:38.810 --> 04:40.300
Mr. Edelstein answer?

04:40.340 --> 04:41.932
PATRIC: Look, I know
the legal point here.

04:41.980 --> 04:43.345
If I'm not a public figure,
then my lavwers

04:43.380 --> 04:44.677
only need to prove
negligence, not malice.

04:44.710 --> 04:45.699
Ah.
I've been
reading the law.

04:45.750 --> 04:46.717
It doesn't make

04:46.750 --> 04:48.308
as much sense
as code,

04:48.350 --> 04:49.442
but I get it.

04:49.490 --> 04:51.446
I'm a 25-year-old
computer programmer.

04:51.490 --> 04:53.355
I've never sought
the spotlight.

04:53.390 --> 04:55.756
I don't want anything
but to do my job.

04:55.790 --> 04:59.954
I'm not a public figure and,
uh, I don't want to be one.

05:00.000 --> 05:02.821
I sympathize,
Mr. Edelstein, I do,

05:02.870 --> 05:05.589
but this is
a move.

05:05.630 --> 05:08.497
It doesn't pretend
to be a documentary.

05:08.540 --> 05:12.806
It is an imaginative
recreation of events.

05:12.840 --> 05:14.876
Well, then they should have
made up a name.

05:14.910 --> 05:16.901
They shouldn't have used mine.

05:19.050 --> 05:20.415
You're good.

05:20.450 --> 05:21.417
Thanks.

05:21.450 --> 05:22.781
When do you
want me back?

05:22.820 --> 05:24.014
Actually, that's it, we're done.

05:24.050 --> 05:24.948
No, the rest

05:24.990 --> 05:26.617
of the depositions.
WILL:
Mr. Edelstein,

05:26.660 --> 05:28.059
these depositions
are pretty boring

05:28.090 --> 05:30.388
and they'll take
the whole week.

05:30.430 --> 05:32.022
You know, my mom got
a call last week

05:32.060 --> 05:33.425
from my eighth
grade teacher.

05:33.460 --> 05:34.996
I loved my eighth grade
teacher-- Mrs. Hart.

05:35.030 --> 05:37.066
She said she just saw
the movie and was worried

05:37.100 --> 05:38.897
that money was turning
me into a jerk.

05:38.930 --> 05:40.659
I don't get
those calls.

05:40.700 --> 05:41.735
My mom does.

05:41.770 --> 05:43.863
(elevator bell dings)

05:43.910 --> 05:46.378
I'll be here this whole week
because this matters to me.

05:46.410 --> 05:48.503
DIANE:
Be back at 2:00.

05:48.540 --> 05:50.701
(elevator doors close)

05:50.750 --> 05:53.719
Won't work to argue that he's
a private ﬁgure, will it?

05:53.750 --> 05:57.117
No, it doesn't matter that he
didn't pursue the public eye.

05:57.150 --> 06:00.551
The public eye pursued him,
so he's a public figure.

06:00.590 --> 06:02.956
They can pretty much write
anything they want about him.

06:02.990 --> 06:04.457
It's too bad.

06:04.490 --> 06:05.855
I like him.

06:09.700 --> 06:12.396
Cary, what's up?

06:12.440 --> 06:13.839
Ms. Sharma.

06:15.070 --> 06:16.765
Ms. Sharma,
thanks for coming by.

06:16.810 --> 06:18.801
I'm Andrew Wiley; I've been put
in charge of the investigation.

06:18.840 --> 06:21.172
I just have
a few questions for you.

06:21.210 --> 06:22.006
Uh, what investigation?

06:22.040 --> 06:23.473
The beating of Dr. Booth,

06:23.510 --> 06:25.649
a Wisconsin psychiatrist
who was testifying

06:25.680 --> 06:27.716
in a Lockhart/Gardner trial
last year.

06:27.750 --> 06:29.411
Do you have
a moment?

06:29.450 --> 06:30.986
Sure, I have several moments.

06:31.020 --> 06:32.954
Good. Dr. Booth woke
from his coma.

06:32.990 --> 06:34.855
Unfortunately, the person
who beat him wore a mask,

06:34.890 --> 06:37.120
so Dr. Booth
couldn't identify him.

06:37.160 --> 06:39.754
Or her.

06:39.800 --> 06:41.756
I understand that,
that you were there

06:41.800 --> 06:42.789
the morning of the beating.

06:42.830 --> 06:44.559
That's how your fingerprints
wound up on the glass

06:44.600 --> 06:46.431
on his desk.
That's right.

06:46.470 --> 06:47.994
Yeah, see,
the odd thing is,

06:48.040 --> 06:50.065
Dr. Booth has no memory
of your being there.

06:51.470 --> 06:53.074
Right. We thought that
might be from his coma.

06:56.040 --> 06:57.246
So what did you ask him?

06:57.280 --> 07:00.477
I mean, when you went to see
Dr. Booth, what did you ask him?

07:00.520 --> 07:02.647
(baby crying)
I asked him
if he stood

07:02.690 --> 07:05.716
by his testimony and
then I asked him details

07:05.750 --> 07:08.184
to see if his testimony held up.

07:08.220 --> 07:10.085
See, just one last thing.

07:10.130 --> 07:11.154
(crying continues)
Sorry.

07:12.760 --> 07:15.593
It's the nanny's day off,
isn't it?

07:15.630 --> 07:17.723
(crying)

07:17.770 --> 07:18.919
(clears throat)
Just, um,

07:18.970 --> 07:21.097
one last, uh, thing.

07:21.140 --> 07:22.630
It's a bit odd.

07:22.670 --> 07:24.228
Your fingerprints
were on this glass,

07:24.270 --> 07:26.704
but, uh, th-they
weren't anywhere else.

07:26.740 --> 07:28.731
I mean, they weren't
on the doorknobs,

07:28.780 --> 07:30.941
they weren't on the chair arms
or the desktop,

07:30.980 --> 07:33.244
but just on this glass.

07:33.280 --> 07:35.111
Mm. That is odd.

07:35.150 --> 07:39.109
I wonder how
that might've happened--

07:39.150 --> 07:44.486
me leaving my fingerprints
on just one place.

07:44.530 --> 07:47.055
Well, thank you
for coming in, Ms. Sharma.

07:47.100 --> 07:48.795
We'll phone you
if we have anything else.

07:48.830 --> 07:51.128
Actually, just one last thing.

07:51.170 --> 07:52.194
That's two
last things.

07:52.230 --> 07:54.767
Yeah, one last thing
after the first last thing.

07:54.800 --> 07:56.802
Uh, did you bring
the glass with you?

07:56.840 --> 07:58.159
Did I bring it with me?

07:59.640 --> 08:03.747
See, Dr. Booth owned a set
but not this one.

08:03.780 --> 08:05.008
This is a Riedel H20

08:05.050 --> 08:06.244
long drink glass.

08:06.280 --> 08:07.247
Dr. Booth
didn't own

08:07.280 --> 08:08.941
any of those,
but I checked

08:08.980 --> 08:11.244
with the Lockhart/Gardner
& Bond purchasing invoices,

08:11.290 --> 08:12.484
and they did.

08:13.290 --> 08:15.679
That is odd.

08:18.690 --> 08:20.658
Any more last things?

08:20.700 --> 08:22.691
Thank you for coming by.

08:22.730 --> 08:25.267
My pleasure.

08:25.300 --> 08:26.699
Cary.

08:31.570 --> 08:34.004
Why didn't you tell me
about the glass?

08:34.040 --> 08:36.179
Cary, thank you for this job.

08:36.210 --> 08:39.008
I'm enjoying it, I am enjoying
getting out of the house.

08:39.050 --> 08:41.041
Don't you ever do that again.

08:42.080 --> 08:44.184
Yeah, she's not a suspect.

08:44.220 --> 08:46.586
The more you try and help her,
the more she is.

08:48.890 --> 08:51.051
Mr. Calamar.

08:51.090 --> 08:52.853
Hey. Andrew Wiley.
Hi.

08:52.900 --> 08:54.049
You want to
come With me?

08:54.100 --> 08:55.089
Yeah, sure.

09:01.070 --> 09:03.630
Legally, there was no reckless
disregard for the truth.

09:03.670 --> 09:05.331
WILL:
Yes, you said that

09:05.370 --> 09:06.337
five times.

09:06.370 --> 09:07.928
Now, your
studio's movie

09:07.980 --> 09:09.948
had a scene

09:09.980 --> 09:13.211
where Mr. Edelstein's girlfriend
broke up with him,

09:13.250 --> 09:15.969
calling him a...
"loner joke."

09:16.020 --> 09:19.911
But isn't it true that there was
no such break-up because

09:19.960 --> 09:22.212
there was no
such girlfriend?
I haven't the foggiest.

09:22.260 --> 09:23.079
Well, as the lead
studio lavwer,

09:23.130 --> 09:26.054
wasn't it your job
to get the foggiest?

09:26.090 --> 09:28.593
No, it was my job to determine

09:28.630 --> 09:30.359
if there was a reckless
disregard for the truth.

09:30.400 --> 09:31.424
So you would claim

09:31.470 --> 09:33.768
that Mr. Edelstein was
not engaged to be married?

09:33.800 --> 09:36.735
No, I would consider
the question irrelevant.

09:36.770 --> 09:37.930
The truth is
irrelevant?

09:37.970 --> 09:40.234
No, the facts of
Mr. Edelstein's life

09:40.280 --> 09:41.804
were irrelevant.

09:41.840 --> 09:43.944
What was relevant is
whether the filmmakers showed

09:43.980 --> 09:45.242
a reckless disregard...

09:45.280 --> 09:47.214
WILL:
For the truth!

09:47.250 --> 09:49.616
You do understand these words
have to mean something?

09:49.650 --> 09:50.787
Please don't,
don't yell, Mister,

09:50.820 --> 09:51.809
uh, Mister...

09:51.850 --> 09:52.657
Gardner.

09:52.690 --> 09:54.089
Why don't you go
ahead and keep that

09:54.120 --> 09:55.314
for the next time
you need to ask?

09:55.360 --> 09:57.624
Oh, look, Mr. Gardner,

09:57.660 --> 10:00.788
we're here, we're in Chicago
in seven-degree weather.

10:00.830 --> 10:02.195
We understand
the need

10:02.230 --> 10:06.189
for some hazing, but is
the shouting really necessary?

10:06.230 --> 10:07.731
It isn't.
Ah.

10:07.770 --> 10:09.192
But it makes it fun for us.

10:10.440 --> 10:12.408
Very well done.

10:12.440 --> 10:14.738
Thank you.

10:14.780 --> 10:15.929
Do you need something?

10:15.980 --> 10:17.072
I want _to be
yourfnend.

10:17.110 --> 10:20.079
You...?

10:20.120 --> 10:21.371
I have a lot of friends.

10:21.420 --> 10:23.888
You can't win this.

10:23.920 --> 10:24.682
It's defamation.

10:24.720 --> 10:27.280
You have to prove malice;
you can't.

10:27.320 --> 10:29.413
Even Mr. Edelstein knows
he's gomg to lose.

10:29.460 --> 10:33.294
He wants the publicity
of the fight, that's all.

10:33.330 --> 10:35.389
Why don't you do
what we're all doing--

10:35.430 --> 10:39.764
chalking up a staggering
amount of billable hours.

10:39.800 --> 10:43.099
Come on,
let's be friends.

10:43.140 --> 10:45.165
Okay.

10:45.210 --> 10:46.165
(chuckles)

10:46.210 --> 10:47.802
How do you get
a tan like that?

10:47.840 --> 10:50.775
Ah, Princeville, Kauai.

10:50.810 --> 10:54.075
I have a beautiful spread--
three acres.

10:54.120 --> 10:56.111
If you're ever
out that way...

10:56.150 --> 10:57.686
Thank you.

10:57.720 --> 10:58.914
I'll see you tomorrow.

11:00.920 --> 11:02.751
(phone beeps on)

11:02.790 --> 11:06.157
Alicia, sorry to do this to you,
but I need everything you have

11:06.190 --> 11:07.953
on the Duke Rosco
defamation suit.

11:08.000 --> 11:10.366
How quickly can you get
to a land line?

11:10.400 --> 11:13.961
(gospel music plays
over speakers)
Um... soon.

11:14.000 --> 11:15.433
'Cause we're gonna win this.

11:15.470 --> 11:18.359
We're gonna win this big.

11:18.410 --> 11:21.299
Captioning sponsored by
CBS

11:32.490 --> 11:35.357
We need to prove the studio not
only knew the movie was untrue,

11:35.390 --> 11:38.257
but they were reckless about the
mmmwdmmmmw.

11:38.290 --> 11:40.724
And they'll never admit
to that.

11:40.760 --> 11:42.762
ALICIA: We have to prove
he was a private figure.

11:42.800 --> 11:43.994
We already tried that.

11:44.030 --> 11:45.759
Edelstein's been
written about too much.

11:45.800 --> 11:46.767
Where are you?

11:46.800 --> 11:47.994
The reception's better.

11:48.040 --> 11:49.337
I found a high spot.

11:49.370 --> 11:51.167
Here's the question.

11:51.210 --> 11:52.768
What does
Edelstein want?

11:52.810 --> 11:54.368
He's too rich
to want money.

11:54.410 --> 11:57.846
My guess is he wants an apology,
but the studio won't apologize.

11:57.880 --> 11:59.916
Wait.

11:59.950 --> 12:03.886
I don't need the studio
to admit reckless disregard.

12:03.920 --> 12:05.512
You don't?
WILL:
No.

12:05.550 --> 12:08.018
I need the screenwriter to.

12:08.060 --> 12:10.426
Why would the screenwriter admit
to reckless disregard?

12:10.460 --> 12:11.882
Because he wants to.

12:11.930 --> 12:13.329
My guess is the writer wants

12:13.360 --> 12:15.055
to say it's his story,
not Edelstein's.

12:16.900 --> 12:18.868
That's right. That's what we did
with Duke Rosco.

12:18.900 --> 12:20.834
Played his ego.

12:20.870 --> 12:23.907
Great. Get me the notes
from the Rosco deposition.

12:23.940 --> 12:25.999
Oh, I'll need to find Wi-Fi.

12:26.040 --> 12:27.837
Soon as you can. Thanks.

12:27.880 --> 12:30.542
This is a pretty spot.

12:30.580 --> 12:33.071
OWEN:
Yeah.

12:33.120 --> 12:35.475
I've been admiring it
for a while now,

12:35.520 --> 12:36.885
out here in the cold.

12:39.320 --> 12:40.912
(horn toots)

12:40.960 --> 12:42.018
KALIN DA:
Cary.

12:42.060 --> 12:43.880
What's up?

12:43.930 --> 12:45.022
Hey.

12:45.060 --> 12:47.358
Uh, I can't. I'm sorry.

12:47.400 --> 12:48.856
What do you mean?

12:48.900 --> 12:50.197
What's Blake saying?

12:50.230 --> 12:51.458
Kalinda, they're beginning

12:51.500 --> 12:53.092
to suspect you
because we're talking.

12:53.140 --> 12:54.164
Suspect?

12:54.200 --> 12:55.360
Kalinda, please.

12:55.400 --> 12:56.560
I'm not protecting myself.

12:56.600 --> 12:58.101
I'm protecting you, okay?

12:58.140 --> 12:59.869
Good-bye.

13:04.050 --> 13:05.472
* Oh, happy day

13:05.510 --> 13:07.410
* Oh, happy day... *

13:07.450 --> 13:10.419
ALICIA:
I need to find Wi-Fi.

13:10.450 --> 13:12.884
Yeah, yeah, there's Starbucks
on every corner here, so,

13:12.920 --> 13:16.356
sultry Will is Mr. Georgetown?

13:16.390 --> 13:17.584
Am I right?

13:17.630 --> 13:19.279
I found my journal
in the backseat.

13:19.330 --> 13:21.195
You kept writing
about Mr. Georgetown.

13:21.230 --> 13:23.061
15-15 that him?

13:23.100 --> 13:24.590
Owen, please.

13:24.630 --> 13:26.427
I need to get Wi-Fi.

13:26.470 --> 13:28.461
Oh, talk to me,
I'll get you Wi-Fi.

13:28.500 --> 13:29.967
Get me Wi-Fi, and I'll talk.

13:30.010 --> 13:31.898
All right. Look up there.

13:31.940 --> 13:35.979
Yeah. They're both
password-protected.

13:36.010 --> 13:37.341
Which one has stronger
signal strength?

13:37.380 --> 13:38.506
Rotterbear2.

13:38.550 --> 13:39.949
Type, "go to

13:39.980 --> 13:41.470
rotterbear2."

13:43.490 --> 13:45.981
That's what tech support gives
novice computer users

13:46.020 --> 13:47.612
so they don't forget
their password.

13:47.660 --> 13:48.854
I can't do that!

13:48.890 --> 13:50.152
It's someone else's Wi-Fi.

13:50.190 --> 13:51.987
Right, and you're
borrowing it.

13:52.030 --> 13:54.999
It's like you're throwing your
soda can in someone's trash.

13:55.030 --> 13:56.520
(laughing):
It is not.

13:56.560 --> 13:57.993
You are so prim and proper.

13:58.030 --> 13:59.327
We're in the middle of nowhere.

13:59.370 --> 14:01.395
Rotterbear2 is
probably some Unabomber

14:01.440 --> 14:03.635
who uses the internet
to surf porn all day.

14:03.670 --> 14:04.967
Well, it's gone anyway.

14:05.010 --> 14:06.204
You know what
I've noticed about you?

14:06.240 --> 14:07.377
(sighs)

14:07.410 --> 14:08.604
You're willing to
do naughty things

14:08.640 --> 14:10.244
if I give you
a little encouragement.

14:10.280 --> 14:11.941
Look, there's more

14:11.980 --> 14:13.174
cabins coming up here.

14:13.220 --> 14:15.017
Keep looking.

14:15.050 --> 14:16.915
Now, what is the deal with Will?

14:16.950 --> 14:18.508
He's my boss.

14:18.550 --> 14:22.884
Yeah... but I've seen the way
you two guys talk to each other.

14:25.160 --> 14:27.355
That is a...

14:27.400 --> 14:30.369
telling pause.

14:30.400 --> 14:32.368
I like Will.

14:32.400 --> 14:34.368
He likes me.

14:34.400 --> 14:36.038
We work well together.

14:36.070 --> 14:37.935
Making sweet music?

14:37.970 --> 14:42.031
* Oh, happy day...

14:42.080 --> 14:43.672
Alicia?

14:43.710 --> 14:46.099
I don't know, okay?

14:46.150 --> 14:48.072
What am I doing?

14:48.120 --> 14:49.314
I like work.

14:49.350 --> 14:51.181
I don't want to screw up work.

14:51.220 --> 14:53.950
Are you... are you
sleeping with him?

14:53.990 --> 14:57.323
No.

14:57.360 --> 14:59.920
But you want to?

14:59.960 --> 15:01.450
* Oh, happy day...

15:01.500 --> 15:03.058
(sighs)

15:03.100 --> 15:04.397
I want to...

15:04.430 --> 15:08.036
not think about it, okay?

15:08.070 --> 15:10.561
Okay.

15:10.610 --> 15:13.135
Look.

15:13.180 --> 15:15.637
Free Wi-Fi.

15:15.680 --> 15:17.045
(siren blaring)

15:17.080 --> 15:19.344
Hey, big-time
FBI lady.

15:19.380 --> 15:21.519
I'll meet you at the car.
All right.

15:21.550 --> 15:24.383
Kalinda, I've missed you.

15:24.420 --> 15:26.081
How are you?

15:26.120 --> 15:28.213
Good.

15:28.260 --> 15:30.080
Have you missed me?

15:30.130 --> 15:31.984
At times.

15:32.030 --> 15:34.419
Look, um, I
need something.

15:34.460 --> 15:36.451
Of course you do.

15:36.500 --> 15:38.365
Do you know
Blake Calamar?

15:38.400 --> 15:40.095
He used to
work for MS-13.

15:40.140 --> 15:43.064
I don't know that name,
but I do know MS-13.

15:43.110 --> 15:45.635
And?

15:45.670 --> 15:48.036
No, no, no, no, no.

15:48.080 --> 15:51.004
What happened
to the preliminaries, Kalinda?

15:51.050 --> 15:53.712
A girl likes to be wined
and dined first.

15:53.750 --> 15:56.116
How's work?

15:59.420 --> 16:01.456
Okay, MS-13 is growing.

16:01.490 --> 16:03.458
Now, a meth gang
is like a shark.

16:03.490 --> 16:05.481
It has to keep moving,
or it dies.

16:05.530 --> 16:08.419
And from what I hear,
it's moving to Chicago.

16:08.460 --> 16:10.291
Joining forces
with a local gang.

16:10.330 --> 16:11.991
A entrepreneur
that you might know.

16:12.030 --> 16:13.133
VVho?

16:13.170 --> 16:15.536
Lemond Bishop?

16:15.570 --> 16:17.538
Look, maybe
we can help each other.

16:17.570 --> 16:19.299
What are you doing
for dinner this Friday?

16:19.340 --> 16:21.274
Eating with you.

16:21.310 --> 16:23.073
MAN:
No,you”.

16:23.110 --> 16:24.509
you know what
I find funny?

16:24.550 --> 16:26.541
That you're suing me,
Mr. Edelstein.

16:26.580 --> 16:28.741
I mean, why not
the director?

16:28.780 --> 16:30.418
Oh, yes.

16:30.450 --> 16:31.587
That's when
you know

16:31.620 --> 16:33.349
"a film by" credit
is a lie.

16:33.390 --> 16:34.550
When there is
a lawswt.

16:34.590 --> 16:35.579
Do you want that
on the record?

16:35.620 --> 16:37.019
Sure.

16:37.060 --> 16:38.584
Let's get everything
in the record.

16:38.630 --> 16:41.690
I'm Rand Blaylock.
I'm the writer.

16:41.730 --> 16:43.698
I had chicken salad
for lunch.

16:43.730 --> 16:46.221
What research materials
did you use for the scene

16:46.270 --> 16:49.034
of my client breaking up with
his girlfriend, Mr. Blaylock?

16:49.070 --> 16:51.436
What research materials?
These.

16:51.470 --> 16:53.131
Your imagination?
Yes.

16:53.180 --> 16:55.569
If that's not a dirty word here.

16:55.610 --> 16:57.749
Far from it.
So you made it up?

16:57.780 --> 17:01.318
Yes, I did what writers
have done since Aristophanes.

17:01.350 --> 17:03.079
I made up a scene

17:03.120 --> 17:05.509
in which Mr. Edelstein
breaks up with his girlfriend,

17:05.550 --> 17:09.156
because I felt that it conveyed
the truth of a character.

17:09.190 --> 17:11.556
Truth of a character.
What-What do you mean by that?

17:11.590 --> 17:14.093
I think he is speaking
artistically.

17:14.130 --> 17:16.690
I know. They're trying to use
my artistic words against me.

17:16.730 --> 17:18.789
Don't worry.
I will be circumspect.

17:23.140 --> 17:24.437
It means, who is this person?

17:24.470 --> 17:26.267
How do they fit
into a narrative?

17:26.310 --> 17:28.471
WILL: What do you
mean, narrative?

17:28.510 --> 17:31.149
I mean that I am trying
to tell a story,

17:31.180 --> 17:33.717
and I need a character
to help me tell that story.

17:33.750 --> 17:36.412
And what was the story you
were trying to tell here?

17:36.450 --> 17:39.089
The story of the Internet,
this age we're in.

17:39.120 --> 17:42.112
Where people just criticize
each other anonymously.

17:42.160 --> 17:44.151
Where all these tiny
little loners

17:44.190 --> 17:46.727
in their tiny little rooms
order out for pizza

17:46.760 --> 17:49.194
and just flame at
each other all the time.

17:49.230 --> 17:52.119
Or when those same loners
blog about your drug use?

17:55.270 --> 17:57.101
Yes, I'm guilty, lawyer-man.

17:57.140 --> 18:00.177
You found it. Malice.

18:00.210 --> 18:02.337
_ This whole movie--
it was just my attempt

18:02.380 --> 18:04.245
at getting back at the Internet.

18:04.280 --> 18:05.645
Take that, Internet!

18:05.680 --> 18:06.840
WILL:
You wanted

18:06.880 --> 18:07.915
Mr. Edelstein's character
in the mowe

18:07.950 --> 18:10.248
to show that_ the internet
was alienating people?

18:10.290 --> 18:12.440
Not just that, but, yes, that.

18:12.490 --> 18:13.684
So it didn't really matter

18:13.720 --> 18:15.881
what Mr. Edelstein's
real character was?

18:15.920 --> 18:17.148
He didn't say that.

18:17.190 --> 18:18.384
Nor do I think that.

18:18.430 --> 18:19.624
Oh, I have a legal
obligation, Counselor.

18:19.660 --> 18:21.218
But, yes,
there's nothing wrong

18:21.260 --> 18:23.421
with having a character
express theme.

18:23.470 --> 18:25.859
The First Amendment protects me

18:25.900 --> 18:27.788
from your stupid,
dumb-ass questions.

18:27.840 --> 18:28.795
Ah, shall we all take
a little break?

18:28.840 --> 18:30.239
No, I know what

18:30.270 --> 18:31.237
he wants me to say, Burl.

18:31.270 --> 18:32.464
Here, I'm gonna say it.

18:32.510 --> 18:35.104
I don't give a rat's ass
about facts.

18:37.250 --> 18:39.502
I give more than a rat's ass--

18:39.550 --> 18:43.247
in fact, every breath
I breathe-- about truth.

18:43.290 --> 18:46.316
Shakespeare's truth,
Tolstoy's truth.

18:46.350 --> 18:48.887
Not this legal mumbo-jumbo.

18:48.920 --> 18:51.184
That's just the graffiti
on a Roman temple.

18:51.230 --> 18:53.152
Forgotten in a year.

18:53.200 --> 18:55.156
But there was no malice, right?

18:55.200 --> 18:56.929
There was no malice.

18:56.960 --> 18:58.598
None.
You wanted

18:58.630 --> 19:00.291
to get back at bloggers

19:00.340 --> 19:03.229
who anonymously criticized
you for your drug use

19:03.270 --> 19:06.262
by ascribing those
supposed characteristics

19:06.310 --> 19:08.471
of those same bloggers
to Mr. Edelstein,

19:08.510 --> 19:10.398
but there was no malice?

19:10.450 --> 19:12.179
That's right.
And you know what?

19:12.210 --> 19:14.314
God bless America.
I'm free to do that.

19:14.350 --> 19:16.170
And you know what else,
Mr. Atticus Finch?

19:16.220 --> 19:17.642
You do the same thing.

19:17.690 --> 19:19.180
You write your own movie,
making fun

19:19.220 --> 19:21.188
of me, my drug use,

19:21.220 --> 19:25.327
and then go get
Mr. Edelstein to finance it.

19:27.730 --> 19:30.824
What?
Nothing further.

19:32.430 --> 19:34.660
What? Are you gonna go
finance your own movie?

19:34.700 --> 19:37.362
We've been going
after the wrong thing.

19:37.410 --> 19:38.763
Defamation?

19:38.810 --> 19:40.471
Yes. It's unwinnable.

19:40.510 --> 19:42.808
So why are we going after
something that's unwinnable?

19:42.840 --> 19:45.308
What's winnable?

19:52.820 --> 19:54.412
WILL: Diane and I have decided
to change the strategy

19:54.460 --> 19:55.586
and go after something winnable.

19:55.620 --> 19:56.882
Right of publicity?

19:56.920 --> 19:58.228
Yeah, we've been going
after the wrong thing.

19:58.260 --> 19:59.852
We can't win defamation.

19:59.890 --> 20:01.448
That's about intent.

20:01.500 --> 20:04.264
We don't need intent
to prove the studio infringed

20:04.300 --> 20:05.665
on Edelstein's
right of publicity.

20:05.700 --> 20:06.860
Why is that?

20:06.900 --> 20:08.333
Sorry. That's Owen.

20:08.370 --> 20:09.564
Oh, hello, Owen.

20:09.600 --> 20:11.363
Sorry to take your sister away.

20:11.410 --> 20:12.763
Oh, don't worry.

20:12.810 --> 20:15.278
I don't think
she minds being taken away.

20:15.310 --> 20:17.369
OWEN (laughing):
I'm going now.

20:17.410 --> 20:19.776
Um, you know, right of
publicity sounds good to me.

20:19.810 --> 20:23.246
And Blaylock, in his deposition,
said Edelstein had a right

20:23.290 --> 20:26.589
to make his own movie,
and that's the point.

20:26.620 --> 20:29.350
The studio used him
to make money,

20:29.390 --> 20:31.381
and now they owe him that money.

20:31.430 --> 20:32.829
Sam Moore
v. The Weinsteins.

20:32.860 --> 20:34.396
They're arguing

20:34.430 --> 20:36.523
the movie Soul Men_
prevents them from being

20:36.560 --> 20:39.290
the ultimate beneficiaries
of their trademarks.

20:39.330 --> 20:41.366
The only problem is,
the studio can argue

20:41.400 --> 20:42.367
it's a transformative work
of art.

20:42.400 --> 20:44.561
ALICIA:
Unless you start
to chip away at it.

20:44.610 --> 20:45.736
How?

20:45.770 --> 20:47.408
_ Look into
their product placement.

20:49.010 --> 20:52.639
Okay. Everybody read,
and we'll get together tomorrow.

20:52.680 --> 20:53.977
Be ready at 8:00.

20:54.020 --> 20:55.908
Okay.

20:55.950 --> 20:58.384
There were other people
on that call, you know?

20:58.420 --> 21:00.354
OWEN:
I know. I was trying
to embarrass you.

21:00.390 --> 21:02.551
(Owen coughing, Alicia sniffs)

21:02.590 --> 21:04.683
Oh, come on!

21:04.730 --> 21:06.459
This isn't high school.

21:06.490 --> 21:08.299
What? This is
medical marijuana.

21:08.330 --> 21:09.319
It is not.

21:09.360 --> 21:10.725
Owen, put it out.

21:10.770 --> 21:12.328
It is. I have
bad joints.

21:12.370 --> 21:14.395
This isn't Oregon.

21:14.440 --> 21:16.499
Put it out, Owen, or I'm...

21:16.540 --> 21:18.508
I'll call Mom.

21:18.540 --> 21:19.962
I'm dialing.

21:21.080 --> 21:23.401
This is Mom and Dad's
fault, you know.

21:23.450 --> 21:25.441
I had a difficult childhood.

21:25.480 --> 21:26.640
This is how I cope.

21:26.680 --> 21:29.069
I don't want
to bail you out of jail.

21:29.120 --> 21:30.314
You never did it?

21:30.350 --> 21:33.012
Never!
With Will?

21:33.050 --> 21:35.314
Will's gonna be your go-to
from now on, isn't it?

21:35.360 --> 21:37.920
No. Ijust... I like
the thought of you trying things

21:37.960 --> 21:39.552
and breaking rules
that you never broke

21:39.590 --> 21:40.750
in high school. Come on.

21:40.800 --> 21:43.564
I am having wine,
and I am very happy.

21:43.600 --> 21:44.897
Thank you.

21:58.380 --> 22:00.348
Search warrant?

22:01.420 --> 22:03.911
Nice paintings.

22:03.950 --> 22:05.918
Thanks.

22:05.950 --> 22:07.110
You want to buy one?

22:07.150 --> 22:08.356
They're yours?

22:09.390 --> 22:12.120
You're hurting
your girlfriend.

22:12.160 --> 22:14.048
My girlfriend.
Kalinda.

22:14.100 --> 22:15.590
You're hurting her
by doing her bidding.

22:15.630 --> 22:17.791
Oh, buddy, I don't do
anything except for me.

22:17.830 --> 22:20.469
We got a lot
in common then.

22:20.500 --> 22:23.833
Guys, don't forget
the bedroom.

22:23.870 --> 22:26.009
You see,
I don't mind this--

22:26.040 --> 22:30.101
random searches,
hostile questions--

22:30.140 --> 22:32.870
but I have friends and
they won't like this.

22:32.910 --> 22:35.640
(chuckling):
Oh, scary.

22:35.680 --> 22:37.648
Yeah, it's funny.

22:37.690 --> 22:39.749
I'm always intimidated
by threats

22:39.790 --> 22:41.678
until I search
people's homes.

22:41.720 --> 22:43.483
Then I see
what books they own,

22:43.530 --> 22:45.725
and it's hard to take their
threats seriously after that.

22:46.760 --> 22:48.853
I like this one.

22:48.900 --> 22:50.868
Don't you?

22:50.900 --> 22:53.892
It's just--
it's so raw.

22:53.940 --> 22:54.998
(baby fusses)

22:55.040 --> 22:57.508
You've seen our
search warrant?

22:57.540 --> 23:00.930
Uh... I have,

23:00.980 --> 23:03.608
but, uh, you didn't need one.

23:03.650 --> 23:05.675
I would have welcomed you in.

23:05.710 --> 23:07.575
We found an e-mail
on your computer

23:07.620 --> 23:10.043
to Lemond Bishop, discussing
"ten pounds of office supplies."

23:10.080 --> 23:11.411
Here's a copy.

23:11.450 --> 23:13.759
It's not my e-mail.

23:13.790 --> 23:15.155
Really?

23:15.190 --> 23:16.555
This was on
your server.

23:16.590 --> 23:17.818
Yeah. Hacked,
most probably.

23:17.860 --> 23:19.623
So you don't
know Lemond Bishop.

23:19.660 --> 23:22.595
No, in my workday I have
had dealings with Mr. Bishop,

23:22.630 --> 23:25.190
but they're all legal,
and all licensed.

23:25.230 --> 23:26.868
And that is not my e-mail.

23:26.900 --> 23:28.162
What, someone broke
into your place

23:28.200 --> 23:29.633
to type an e-mail
on your computer?

23:29.670 --> 23:33.060
Yeah.
Yeah.

23:33.110 --> 23:36.136
Sure. That could happen.

23:36.180 --> 23:37.704
I like this one.

23:37.750 --> 23:40.810
Will phoned me
to tell me something,

23:40.850 --> 23:42.841
but I never got
the message.

23:43.590 --> 23:44.841
What?

23:44.890 --> 23:50.055
Will... phoned me,
to tell me something...

23:50.090 --> 23:52.581
passionate,
and I never heard it.

23:56.030 --> 23:57.998
How did you never hear it?

23:58.030 --> 23:58.928
I don't know.

23:58.970 --> 24:00.892
My phone gobbles things.

24:00.940 --> 24:01.929
It doesn't gobble things.

24:01.970 --> 24:03.699
What are, what are you,
like, four?

24:03.740 --> 24:06.607
No, I-- the pictures
I sent Mom... (splutters)

24:06.640 --> 24:10.178
Look, that is because you didn't
include it as an attachment.

24:10.210 --> 24:11.973
Please?

24:12.010 --> 24:16.913
Can we not talk about my
technological ineptness?

24:16.950 --> 24:20.113
Yeah, but how do you know
he phoned if you didn't
get the message?

24:20.150 --> 24:21.959
I can't tell you,
it's confidential.

24:21.990 --> 24:24.026
_Your love life
is confidential?

24:24.060 --> 24:25.857
Do I talk to him,
that's the question.

24:25.890 --> 24:28.620
Do I ask him what he said?

24:28.660 --> 24:31.094
Do you ask Will...
what he said to you?

24:31.130 --> 24:32.620
Yes.

24:32.670 --> 24:34.695
But he's in love with somebody.

24:34.740 --> 24:38.062
I mean, not "in love,"
in something.

24:38.110 --> 24:41.876
And she's nice,
I really like her.

24:41.910 --> 24:46.700
And they like sports together.

24:46.750 --> 24:48.615
Always talking about

24:48.650 --> 24:51.915
(goofy voice): three-pointer
this and three-pointer that.

24:51.950 --> 24:53.986
I know I just made fun
of her voice, but

24:54.020 --> 24:58.855
I do think
that it would really

24:58.890 --> 25:00.994
be a mistake
to ask him.

25:01.030 --> 25:02.156
Oh, wow.

25:02.200 --> 25:04.088
I'm conflicted.

25:04.130 --> 25:05.529
You're in love.

25:10.570 --> 25:11.969
I can't be.

25:12.010 --> 25:14.103
Happens to the best of us.

25:17.140 --> 25:19.199
What do I do?

25:19.250 --> 25:21.616
What do I want you to do?

25:21.650 --> 25:23.789
Or... what will you do?

25:23.820 --> 25:26.038
Which one will
I like more?

25:26.090 --> 25:28.183
We get home.

25:28.220 --> 25:30.188
You... clean up a little,

25:30.220 --> 25:32.085
'cause you're looking a little
rough around the edges.

25:32.130 --> 25:34.598
You comb your hair, and you
put on something nice--

25:34.630 --> 25:37.155
but businesslike, you know,
not too slutty--

25:37.200 --> 25:39.862
and you go to him.

25:39.900 --> 25:43.961
And you say, "Will, I need
a moment of your time."

25:44.010 --> 25:46.968
And he'll be like, "Okay."

25:47.010 --> 25:48.773
Like that,
kind of manly, like.

25:48.810 --> 25:50.971
And then you say...

25:51.010 --> 25:54.116
What?

25:54.150 --> 25:56.209
I've been watching you
for 15 years.

25:56.250 --> 25:59.048
I'm tired of shoving
love to the side

25:59.090 --> 26:01.251
and serving other people.

26:01.290 --> 26:04.919
I can't think of
anything more important

26:04.960 --> 26:06.325
in my life right now,

26:06.360 --> 26:09.989
than the feeling
of your breath on my neck,

26:10.030 --> 26:13.158
your hands
on my breasts.

26:13.200 --> 26:14.337
I can't do that.

26:14.370 --> 26:15.667
It's Alicia-time.

26:17.200 --> 26:18.838
Shut up.

26:18.870 --> 26:19.962
Good to have you
back, ma'am.

26:20.010 --> 26:25.107
Did you try to buy the rights
to Mr. Edelstein's story?

26:25.150 --> 26:26.799
Yes, among others.

26:26.850 --> 26:28.112
And why did he
turn you down?

26:28.150 --> 26:29.913
Well, I imagine he
can tell you that.

26:29.950 --> 26:32.680
But he said he didn't
want his story told.

26:32.720 --> 26:34.688
Do you know
what this is?

26:34.720 --> 26:35.914
That's a T-shirt,

26:35.960 --> 26:37.109
with a likeness
of the actor

26:37.160 --> 26:38.354
who plays the part
of Patric Edelstein.

26:38.390 --> 26:39.982
That's right.

26:40.030 --> 26:45.161
I purchased it downstairs,
not a half-hour ago, for $23.99.

26:45.200 --> 26:48.089
Was it licensed by
your studio, ma'am?

26:49.840 --> 26:52.058
I don't think Mr. Preston
has the answer to that.

26:52.110 --> 26:55.102
Yes, it was licensed
by our studio.

26:55.140 --> 26:56.368
And you're also
selling a book

26:56.410 --> 26:58.071
about the "Making Of,"
is that right?

26:58.110 --> 26:59.338
PRESTON:
Excuse me, Ms. Lockhart.

26:59.380 --> 27:03.146
We would argue that our movie's
a transformative work of art.

27:03.180 --> 27:06.741
And therefore impervious to
any "right of publicity" claim

27:06.790 --> 27:08.212
by Mr. Edelstein.

27:08.260 --> 27:09.409
Meaning it's a
work of art,

27:09.460 --> 27:11.121
and not a work
of commerce?
That's correct.

27:11.160 --> 27:14.220
The Supreme Court
has shown great bias

27:14.260 --> 27:15.955
for free, non-commercial
expression.

27:16.000 --> 27:18.264
Thank you for that
clarification.
You're welcome.

27:18.300 --> 27:19.289
Anything to save us
some time here.

27:19.330 --> 27:22.390
So, ma'am,
talk to me about

27:22.440 --> 27:24.328
the product placement
in the movie.

27:24.370 --> 27:27.339
Objection. That's irrelevant
to this deposition.

27:27.370 --> 27:30.134
Shall we let the court determine
what's what, Mr. Preston?

27:30.180 --> 27:33.172
DIANE:
Ma'am, could you tell me
how many companies

27:33.210 --> 27:35.269
placed their products
in your movie?

27:35.320 --> 27:37.276
Twenty-three.

27:37.320 --> 27:40.380
My goodness. That's a lot of
artistic expression to dim up.

27:40.420 --> 27:44.925
And how many products did these
23 companies place in the movie?

27:44.960 --> 27:46.780
I'd like to call a halt
to these proceedings

27:46.830 --> 27:48.127
till after lunch.
Thank you.

27:48.160 --> 27:50.094
That was fun.

27:50.130 --> 27:52.690
The last thing they'll want
to do is open their books.

27:52.730 --> 27:54.994
Thank you.
Both of you.

27:55.040 --> 27:57.099
You're, uh, making this
an entertaining ride.

27:57.140 --> 27:59.233
Trying to give you
your money's worth.

27:59.270 --> 28:01.272
Oh, no.

28:04.280 --> 28:05.304
How dare you.

28:05.350 --> 28:07.306
What's wrong, Viola?

28:07.350 --> 28:09.011
Sit down.

28:09.050 --> 28:10.745
You're stealing him!

28:10.790 --> 28:12.212
You are trying
to steal Edelstein.

28:12.250 --> 28:14.218
What are you talking about?

28:14.260 --> 28:15.909
I told you
it was a loser.

28:15.960 --> 28:17.109
I shared the wealth,

28:17.160 --> 28:18.787
I could've shared it
with anybody in Chicago!

28:18.830 --> 28:20.457
We're trying to win a case
for your client, Viola.

28:20.490 --> 28:21.752
Oh, no!

28:21.800 --> 28:23.427
Don't, don't try
to turn it noble.

28:23.460 --> 28:25.860
You are showing off for him.

28:25.900 --> 28:28.130
And what's worse, I have
to hear it from Preston.

28:28.170 --> 28:31.207
I have to hear it
from the opposition!

28:31.240 --> 28:32.332
You heard it from
our opp05ition

28:32.370 --> 28:33.871
because he's afraid
we're beating him.

28:33.910 --> 28:36.936
Just... go to hell!

28:36.980 --> 28:38.379
It's no wonder that
they call you

28:38.410 --> 28:39.502
an ice queen
behind your back.

28:39.550 --> 28:41.347
Where is this
coming from, Viola?

28:41.380 --> 28:43.416
I've been nothing but
straightforward with you--

28:43.450 --> 28:45.418
You've been nothing but
a conniving bitch!

28:45.450 --> 28:47.213
And another thing.

28:47.250 --> 28:48.786
You're fired.

28:48.820 --> 28:51.425
Ms. Walsh...

28:51.460 --> 28:53.348
you're fired.

28:58.530 --> 29:00.498
Thank you for coming
in, Mr. Abaire.

29:00.530 --> 29:03.363
And you've worked for your
automotive company for how long?

29:03.400 --> 29:05.038
Ten happy years.

29:05.070 --> 29:06.537
Our tin anniversary.

29:06.570 --> 29:08.128
(laughs)

29:08.180 --> 29:12.241
And you work in their product
integration department?

29:12.280 --> 29:13.372
ABAIRE:
Yes.

29:13.410 --> 29:15.378
DIANE: And you negotiated
with the studio

29:15.420 --> 29:17.172
to have your automobiles
placed in their movie?

29:17.220 --> 29:19.848
Yes. The 2011 LaHavre.

29:19.890 --> 29:22.450
Uh, two passive placements,
and one integrated placement.

29:22.490 --> 29:25.152
"Passive" meaning beauty
shots-- and "integrated"?

29:25.190 --> 29:27.556
Uh, meaning there had to
be at least one mention

29:27.590 --> 29:29.558
of the automobile's features.

29:29.600 --> 29:35.960
For example, our voice-activated
onboard navigation system.

29:36.000 --> 29:38.798
And how was this movie
sold to you?

29:38.840 --> 29:41.479
Uh... well, I...
I don't understand.

29:41.510 --> 29:44.343
Was Mr. Edelstein's name used

29:44.380 --> 29:46.848
in trying to convince you to
place your cars in the movie?

29:46.880 --> 29:47.915
Oh, yeah, of course.

29:47.950 --> 29:51.511
It was between this movie
and Social Network.

29:51.550 --> 29:53.108
Would you have agreed
to pay the studio

29:53.150 --> 29:56.210
if the movie had been not
about Mr. Edelstein?

29:56.260 --> 29:58.080
For example, if it
had been about

29:58.130 --> 29:59.552
a fictional
computer programmer.

29:59.590 --> 30:02.559
Oh, uh, no.
Of course not.

30:02.600 --> 30:04.363
I think we can call
a halt to this.

30:04.400 --> 30:07.597
Really? I think we have
a few more questions.

30:07.630 --> 30:09.598
You won.

30:09.640 --> 30:11.130
Take yes for an answer.

30:13.310 --> 30:14.538
$35 million.

30:14.580 --> 30:16.036
And an apology.

30:16.080 --> 30:17.536
We're sorry.

30:17.580 --> 30:19.400
(laughing)

30:19.450 --> 30:24.149
* Elevator straight into
my skull... *

30:25.620 --> 30:27.542
KALINDA: Thought
you had a home.

30:27.590 --> 30:30.923
I do.
Lake Forest.

30:30.960 --> 30:33.087
When I work past 11:00,
the government is required

30:33.130 --> 30:34.392
to pay for in-town
accommodations .

30:34.430 --> 30:37.888
How nice.
My tax dollars at work.

30:37.930 --> 30:40.194
So Blake Calamar, huh?

30:40.230 --> 30:41.538
That's a new name to us.

30:41.570 --> 30:42.992
Really?

30:43.040 --> 30:44.564
I'm surprised.

30:44.610 --> 30:47.408
We've been juggling a lot
of balls at the FBI.

30:47.440 --> 30:48.907
But I guess you have, too.

30:53.150 --> 30:55.015
I'm taking off my shoe.

30:55.050 --> 30:57.245
See?

30:57.280 --> 30:59.441
I can see.

30:59.490 --> 31:01.355
* Farewell my black balloon...

31:01.390 --> 31:06.657
I'm stretching
out my foot.

31:06.690 --> 31:08.658
Are you all right
with that?

31:08.700 --> 31:12.022
You have to stretch,
you have to stretch.

31:12.070 --> 31:15.267
I have an offer for you.

31:15.300 --> 31:17.268
Come work for me.

31:17.300 --> 31:19.666
It's not good at
Lockhart/Gardner.

31:19.710 --> 31:22.201
And it won't be good
for quite some time.

31:22.240 --> 31:24.049
And why is that?

31:24.080 --> 31:27.106
Your firm is
representing Bishop.

31:27.150 --> 31:28.469
The drug dealer.

31:28.520 --> 31:31.683
Yeah, his legitimate interests.

31:31.720 --> 31:34.917
He has no legitimate
interests.

31:37.460 --> 31:39.621
* Has anybody ever told you
it's not coming true... *

31:39.660 --> 31:42.629
The firm is in danger.

31:42.660 --> 31:44.127
Come work for me.

31:44.170 --> 31:46.468
* Farewell my black balloon...

31:46.500 --> 31:49.492
We've had this conversation.

31:49.540 --> 31:52.429
I... I like it where I am.

31:52.470 --> 31:55.678
* Farewell my black balloon...

31:55.710 --> 31:58.440
Why do you like men?

31:58.480 --> 32:01.176
Why do I like men?

32:01.220 --> 32:04.348
Yes. Sex with men.

32:04.390 --> 32:05.709
Why do you like it?

32:05.750 --> 32:09.379
I don't distinguish.

32:09.420 --> 32:13.254
You... don't
have a preference?

32:15.260 --> 32:17.296
(sighs)

32:19.770 --> 32:21.362
You were saying?

32:21.400 --> 32:25.632
I was saying...

32:25.670 --> 32:29.674
Italian, Mexican, Thai,

32:29.710 --> 32:32.372
why does one choose
one food over the other?

32:32.410 --> 32:34.378
Because sex is not food.

32:34.420 --> 32:35.648
Because of love?

32:35.680 --> 32:37.216
Or intimacy.

32:37.250 --> 32:38.615
Don't you want intimacy?

32:38.650 --> 32:41.619
No.

32:41.660 --> 32:44.686
(phone ringing)

32:47.130 --> 32:48.722
I have to get that.

32:48.760 --> 32:50.625
Then you're going to
need your foot back.

33:02.440 --> 33:04.408
You following me?

33:04.450 --> 33:06.372
We need to talk.

33:06.410 --> 33:07.672
Sure, let's talk.

33:07.710 --> 33:09.644
Let's all talk.

33:19.660 --> 33:22.652
What do you need?

33:22.700 --> 33:24.691
You talking to the Feds?

33:26.500 --> 33:27.797
I was having dinner
with a Fed.

33:27.830 --> 33:30.037
One Fed.

33:31.770 --> 33:34.603
Why? Jealous?

33:36.840 --> 33:40.003
Kalinda, the kids
have all gone to bed, okay?

33:41.550 --> 33:44.212
It's just me and you--
the adults.

33:45.690 --> 33:47.681
It's time to be honest.

33:47.720 --> 33:49.779
You start.

33:53.330 --> 33:55.218
Are you armed?

34:19.690 --> 34:21.817
You missed a spot.

34:30.160 --> 34:33.288
You unclasp it
at the top.

34:38.270 --> 34:40.204
My turn.

34:40.240 --> 34:41.468
(gasping)

34:43.310 --> 34:46.302
TSA.
You know the drill.

34:46.350 --> 34:49.842
You wrote that e-mail to Bishop.

34:49.880 --> 34:51.780
And you planted it
in my apartment

34:51.820 --> 34:53.515
for your boyfriend to find.

34:53.550 --> 34:56.713
The ASA? Cary?

34:56.760 --> 34:58.785
You didn't come to
Lockhart/Gardner

34:58.830 --> 34:59.785
as an investigator.

34:59.830 --> 35:03.129
Come on. Honesty.

35:09.740 --> 35:11.731
You wearing a wire?

35:15.210 --> 35:17.804
I'm a fixer.

35:17.840 --> 35:19.899
Bond wants something to happen,

35:19.950 --> 35:22.544
doesn't want to know
how it happened, that's me.

35:22.580 --> 35:26.186
I didn't plant anything
in your apartment.

35:26.220 --> 35:28.188
You should look elsewhere.

35:28.220 --> 35:30.381
And what about your meeting
with the Feds?

35:30.420 --> 35:35.221
She wants me to leave
Lockhart/Gardner, join her.

35:36.900 --> 35:39.460
She knows that MS-13

35:39.500 --> 35:41.491
is joining forces
with Bishop.

35:44.870 --> 35:47.532
What does Bond want you to fix?

35:47.570 --> 35:50.676
He wanted me to investigate
everyone at the firm,

35:50.710 --> 35:53.645
see who was a threat
to a takeover,

35:53.680 --> 35:55.341
and who was an asset.

35:55.380 --> 36:00.181
Your connection to
Will-- what is it?

36:00.220 --> 36:03.257
(scoffs)
I did, uh...

36:03.290 --> 36:06.350
I did some work for him
at his first firm in Baltimore.

36:06.390 --> 36:08.199
Illegal work?

36:09.730 --> 36:11.721
He owes me.

36:12.930 --> 36:15.967
You know, Donna
thinks that...

36:16.000 --> 36:18.901
you like women
more than men.

36:18.940 --> 36:20.908
Sometimes.

36:23.280 --> 36:25.475
Depends.

36:29.720 --> 36:32.644
Where's my baseball bat?

36:36.790 --> 36:37.882
It's in my bag.

36:37.920 --> 36:40.229
I want it back.

36:51.970 --> 36:53.506
So you'll lay off?

36:53.540 --> 36:55.838
Lay off what?

36:55.880 --> 36:58.474
Everything.

37:03.280 --> 37:05.282
Yeah.

37:19.670 --> 37:21.695
Why do you care
about Leela?

37:21.740 --> 37:22.968
I don't.

37:23.000 --> 37:26.401
Then... what do
you care about?

37:38.080 --> 37:39.945
(grunts)

37:39.990 --> 37:41.958
(coughs, sniffles)

37:45.030 --> 37:47.419
(groans, gasps)

37:47.460 --> 37:48.859
It's all right.
You'll have trouble

37:48.900 --> 37:50.049
breathing for a minute.

37:50.100 --> 37:53.024
(gasping weakly)

37:53.070 --> 37:57.860
Hi. Uh, my boyfriend's
had an accident,

37:57.900 --> 38:00.539
and he's injured
his chest.

38:00.570 --> 38:02.379
He's having
problems breathing.

38:02.410 --> 38:04.503
Could you send
someone up please?

38:04.550 --> 38:05.744
Thank you.

38:08.050 --> 38:10.439
Wait...
I'm going
now, Blake.

38:10.480 --> 38:11.947
You trying to say something?

38:11.990 --> 38:13.048
Leela...

38:13.090 --> 38:14.580
(coughs)

38:14.620 --> 38:15.757
Yeah.

38:15.790 --> 38:17.781
You keep going with that.

38:17.820 --> 38:19.378
Leela, I...

38:19.430 --> 38:22.024
Why don't you try
taking a breath, hmm?

38:23.030 --> 38:26.818
I phoned...

38:26.870 --> 38:30.328
I phoned... your husband...

38:35.440 --> 38:37.579
ALICIA:
You want to come in?

38:37.610 --> 38:40.101
No, I better
get moved in.

38:40.150 --> 38:42.744
So... Oh, thanks.
Sure.

38:50.660 --> 38:53.720
What did you mean,
what I will do?

38:53.760 --> 38:55.125
What?

38:55.160 --> 38:56.422
About Will-- you said,

38:56.460 --> 38:58.826
"What you want me to do,
and what I will do."

38:58.870 --> 39:00.690
What will I do?

39:00.730 --> 39:03.836
Oh...

39:03.870 --> 39:07.533
You're a good person, Alicia.

39:07.570 --> 39:09.629
You're pretending
that you're not--

39:09.680 --> 39:13.377
that this recent
unpleasantness
has changed you,

39:13.410 --> 39:15.116
but it hasn't.

39:15.150 --> 39:17.846
You are who you are.

39:17.880 --> 39:21.418
You... can't cheat.

39:21.460 --> 39:23.917
It's not in your makeup.

39:26.890 --> 39:29.529
Thanks for the company.

39:29.560 --> 39:32.597
I'll see you soon.
Okay.

40:13.740 --> 40:15.537
Well, uh, according
to the lawyers,

40:15.580 --> 40:17.002
I have to say this.

40:17.040 --> 40:20.146
My Patric Edelstein is not

40:20.180 --> 40:22.614
the real Patric Edelstein.

40:22.650 --> 40:27.519
to which I have my own legal
one word retort-- duh.

40:27.550 --> 40:29.916
Yes, we lost the lawsuit.

40:29.960 --> 40:32.451
Yes, there is fiction
in every fact.

40:32.490 --> 40:35.197
But you know what I hate?
I think I know
what he hates.

40:35.230 --> 40:38.768
Our litigious society
and a world

40:38.800 --> 40:41.189
where lawyers find cleverer
and cleverer ways

40:41.230 --> 40:42.788
to make end runs around
the First Amendment.

40:42.840 --> 40:44.808
Hey, he called us clever.
(chuckles)

40:44.840 --> 40:47.001
What happens to writers

40:47.040 --> 40:50.009
and to satirists if every time
they offend someone

40:50.040 --> 40:51.974
they're sued based on
right of publicity?

40:52.010 --> 40:53.807
He's not wrong.

40:53.850 --> 40:56.114
(broadcast continues
in background)
Of course he's not wrong.

40:56.150 --> 40:58.118
The last refuge of the loser
is to not be wrong.

41:01.690 --> 41:04.579
Hey. How was, uh...

41:04.630 --> 41:07.827
everywhere?
It was good. Good!

41:07.860 --> 41:09.657
Well, good job
on the road.

41:09.700 --> 41:11.827
The studio apologized.

41:11.870 --> 41:13.929
And we did pretty well.

41:17.270 --> 41:19.238
Will, I need a
moment of your time.

41:19.270 --> 41:21.158
Okay.

41:22.780 --> 41:25.271
I never got the second
message to my cell phone.

41:25.310 --> 41:27.574
I don't know why.

41:27.610 --> 41:28.645
The second?

41:28.680 --> 41:29.612
No, you got everything.

41:29.650 --> 41:31.914
When you phoned Peter's
press conference,

41:31.950 --> 41:35.556
you left two messages,
but I didn't get the second.

41:35.590 --> 41:36.955
I only got the first.

41:36.990 --> 41:40.858
I hate missed connections
and that stuff, so...

41:40.890 --> 41:44.565
can I ask, what did you say?

41:47.900 --> 41:50.130
In my second message?

41:53.110 --> 41:54.259
Yes.

41:59.250 --> 42:01.502
You don't have to say.

42:04.220 --> 42:07.041
Well, I will.

42:07.090 --> 42:10.651
I said, I think you made
the right decision

42:10.690 --> 42:12.681
with Peter.

42:12.730 --> 42:15.699
And I didn't want us to be
uncomfortable at work.

42:20.230 --> 42:23.336
Okay.

42:23.370 --> 42:25.759
Good.

42:25.810 --> 42:27.266
And we're not.

42:27.310 --> 42:28.777
And we're not.

42:31.210 --> 42:34.338
Okay.

42:34.380 --> 42:36.268
I should get back to work.

42:40.290 --> 42:41.848
It's good to have you back.

42:41.890 --> 42:44.256
It's good to be back.
