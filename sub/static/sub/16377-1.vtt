02:15.400 --> 02:16.925
Hello.

02:22.240 --> 02:25.400
They call me Doom-Head.

02:25.480 --> 02:29.610
Now, I don't call myself Doom-Head,
mind you, but they do.

02:31.120 --> 02:32.531
Who's they?

02:34.160 --> 02:35.960
Well, some mysterious folks...

02:36.040 --> 02:39.920
that pay me a whole lot
of scratch to do what I do.

02:40.000 --> 02:44.164
And what I do, unfortunately for you...

02:46.680 --> 02:48.808
I do real well.

02:52.040 --> 02:53.280
Now.

02:55.560 --> 02:58.723
Let's get one thing between us straight.

03:00.840 --> 03:04.322
I ain't no fucking clown.

03:06.280 --> 03:09.320
Now, Mr. P.T. Barnum
may claim clowns are the pegs...

03:09.400 --> 03:12.051
on which this circus is hung...

03:13.960 --> 03:17.931
but I ain't no fucking clown.

03:19.440 --> 03:23.360
You may think you see a grease-painted
performer sitting before you...

03:23.440 --> 03:28.160
who would usually elicit
an amused response from an audience...

03:28.240 --> 03:29.651
but trust me...

03:30.760 --> 03:32.330
you do not.

03:33.440 --> 03:36.125
I'm not here to make you happy.

03:38.240 --> 03:41.080
I'm not here to brighten
your dismal day...

03:41.160 --> 03:45.927
and I am certainly not here
to elicit an amused response.

03:47.280 --> 03:52.047
I am here to end
your miserable fucking life.

03:55.720 --> 03:57.131
But first...

04:09.720 --> 04:11.800
First...

04:11.880 --> 04:14.451
I'm gonna bless you with a story.

04:17.760 --> 04:20.839
See, I don't think the last sound
to puncture your ear drums...

04:20.920 --> 04:24.360
should be the twang
of your body falling apart.

04:24.440 --> 04:25.646
Snap.

04:28.760 --> 04:30.171
Crunch.

04:32.080 --> 04:34.162
Interesting fact...

04:35.560 --> 04:37.400
did you know that a cockroach...

04:37.480 --> 04:41.007
can live up to 168 hours without a head?

04:43.280 --> 04:44.880
I know.

04:44.960 --> 04:49.761
I find this... fascinating.

04:51.680 --> 04:55.760
But what really blows
my fucking marbles...

04:55.840 --> 04:59.920
like a 50-cent skank...

05:00.000 --> 05:03.880
I mean the real mind-fucker...

05:03.960 --> 05:07.760
is that for several more hours
this same decapitated head...

05:07.840 --> 05:10.969
will keep on trucking for Jesus.

05:12.480 --> 05:15.370
If properly nourished, of course.

05:17.200 --> 05:19.806
You know, all in all,
you've got a pretty good run.

05:21.360 --> 05:23.400
But deep down inside...

05:23.480 --> 05:26.245
you must have known
it all had to end somewhere.

05:27.440 --> 05:31.920
Might as well be here.
Might as well be now.

05:32.000 --> 05:35.080
And it might as well be with me.

05:35.160 --> 05:37.280
Where's my wife?

05:37.360 --> 05:40.682
What did you sick bastards do
to my beautiful wife?

05:41.920 --> 05:45.320
She's the mother
of our two beautiful girls.

05:45.400 --> 05:47.440
Rebecca, Josephine, they're beautiful.

05:47.520 --> 05:49.090
They're just like her, please.

05:51.600 --> 05:54.251
I know where she is.

05:55.880 --> 05:59.851
Two little clowns I know
took a fancy to her.

05:59.960 --> 06:03.800
So I think she might be
sticking around for a bit, huh?

06:03.880 --> 06:07.080
...though I walk through the valley
of the shadow of death I fear no evil...

06:07.160 --> 06:09.000
Christ almighty...

06:09.080 --> 06:14.041
you Jesus freaks
are so fucking sensitive, huh?

06:15.000 --> 06:17.367
Shit.

06:17.480 --> 06:20.480
You should be thanking me, man.

06:20.560 --> 06:24.160
I'm sending you straight
to the fucking pearly gates...

06:24.240 --> 06:26.288
with a first-class ticket.

06:40.920 --> 06:45.847
I should apologize in advance
for not sharpening this thing.

06:46.960 --> 06:50.320
It might take a couple of extra whacks.

06:50.400 --> 06:51.720
Listen to me. Listen to me.

06:51.800 --> 06:53.680
Please, I'm begging you. I'm begging you.

06:53.760 --> 06:56.560
You don't have...
You don't have to do this.

06:56.640 --> 06:59.520
You don't... You don't have to do this.

06:59.600 --> 07:01.880
We can both walk away.

07:01.960 --> 07:04.520
Bring Georgina to me.

07:04.600 --> 07:07.360
And you let us walk away,
no one would know.

07:07.440 --> 07:08.840
- Fuck it.
- No, no!

07:08.920 --> 07:11.240
You know what they say, Kimosabe.

07:11.320 --> 07:13.322
In Hell...

07:14.400 --> 07:16.846
everybody loves popcorn.

07:25.880 --> 07:28.121
Motherfucker.

07:29.040 --> 07:30.724
Number fucking two.

11:21.120 --> 11:25.603
Hey, Randy, man, I hope you know
that "E" stands for "empty", not "eat."

11:27.200 --> 11:29.760
I am hungry, but that's not possible.

11:29.840 --> 11:31.524
Check it.

11:33.680 --> 11:36.000
Suck my motherfucking balls.

11:36.080 --> 11:37.960
No, thanks.

11:38.040 --> 11:40.840
How am I supposed to work
with this inferior goddamn equipment?

11:40.920 --> 11:42.968
Is that what the ladies
are calling it now?

11:44.200 --> 11:47.921
Trust me, my doo-wally's working fine.

11:48.800 --> 11:50.450
Hey, look here boy...

11:50.560 --> 11:52.960
if this monster break down
here in the ass of nowhere...

11:53.040 --> 11:55.960
you gonna get your lard ass
out there and you gonna push...

11:56.040 --> 11:58.520
with the bumper up your ass.

11:58.600 --> 12:00.280
Venus, I think it might be time...

12:00.360 --> 12:03.600
to bring back the girl
into a gorilla illusion.

12:03.680 --> 12:06.240
- You all got a gorilla?
- Yeah, I got a fucking gorilla.

12:06.320 --> 12:08.400
He's in my pants. I call him King Dong.

12:08.480 --> 12:10.320
Hey, filly.

12:10.400 --> 12:13.160
- I assume you're joking.
- I am not.

12:13.240 --> 12:15.280
And haven't we got enough
to worry about...

12:15.360 --> 12:17.960
without you framing up a new show?

12:18.040 --> 12:21.647
I mean, besides,
who's gonna hustle this other shit?

12:21.760 --> 12:24.320
You think I want to be a fucking mechanic?

12:24.400 --> 12:26.209
Fixing these death traps
the rest of my life?

12:27.520 --> 12:29.160
I mean, I got dreams.

12:29.240 --> 12:32.320
And they do not include yanking
some kid's chewed up arm...

12:32.400 --> 12:34.160
out of the gears of a Tilt-a-Whirl.

12:34.240 --> 12:36.400
Baby, I got dreams, too. You go for it.

12:36.480 --> 12:37.840
Get the fuck off me.

12:37.920 --> 12:39.880
Hey, baby girl...

12:39.960 --> 12:42.960
I mean, what do you think
about that talent back there?

12:43.040 --> 12:44.880
I mean, the one
with the lop-sided high beams.

12:44.960 --> 12:47.200
I mean, I don't know
if she's drunk or retarded.

12:47.280 --> 12:48.800
Seriously?

12:48.880 --> 12:53.283
She's gonna twitch and itch
her ass all around the mid-way.

12:53.880 --> 12:55.720
Just like all the new babies do.

12:55.800 --> 12:57.768
But that's why I afraid.

12:59.040 --> 13:00.166
A new wave of crap's coming.

13:02.480 --> 13:04.880
So what exactly is the name
of this show of yours?

13:04.960 --> 13:06.760
Okay, dig this.

13:06.840 --> 13:11.323
Professor Ghouldini's
Mad Gorilla Monster Show.

13:12.040 --> 13:14.040
I'd go see that show.

13:14.120 --> 13:15.480
The name's got some grab...

13:15.560 --> 13:18.040
but you're still minus one jungle girl.

13:18.120 --> 13:19.400
I could be a jungle girl.

13:19.480 --> 13:21.840
I took a acting class
before I left high school.

13:21.920 --> 13:23.570
Just shut the fuck up for two seconds.

13:26.000 --> 13:28.048
That's where Charly girl comes in.

13:28.160 --> 13:32.520
Charly hardly looks like
a wild woman of Borneo.

13:32.600 --> 13:36.040
And besides, you know that she is
my main hustle in the girly show.

13:36.120 --> 13:38.280
Okay, we dump the whole Borneo shit, okay?

13:38.360 --> 13:39.960
We work a new angle.

13:40.040 --> 13:42.120
The yokels had burnt out
on that yarn ten years ago.

13:42.200 --> 13:44.360
What's a yokel?

13:44.440 --> 13:46.320
What's the word on this wacky weed...

13:46.400 --> 13:48.960
this fine sunny, sunny day,
sweet Charly girl?

13:49.040 --> 13:54.410
The Midwest says sweet Charly,
she got some sweet Rasta shit.

13:56.000 --> 13:58.280
My sweet Charly...

13:58.360 --> 14:00.249
pass your brothers a hit.

14:01.640 --> 14:03.600
It ain't mine, baby.

14:03.680 --> 14:05.880
Yeah, baby boy.

14:05.960 --> 14:08.800
I got to keep my eyes on the road.

14:08.880 --> 14:10.041
This shit's the real deal.

14:11.560 --> 14:14.240
Think you two can handle it?

14:14.320 --> 14:15.924
I try, I try.

14:16.040 --> 14:17.440
First hit's free.

14:17.520 --> 14:21.000
After that you lay out the green...

14:21.080 --> 14:24.402
before Charly gets too mean.

14:25.320 --> 14:27.721
Shit, woman, I'm good for it.

14:29.080 --> 14:31.242
Levon, I got to get in there.

14:34.600 --> 14:35.960
- Levon.
- Go away.

14:36.040 --> 14:37.720
Hey, it ain't the Levon show.

14:37.800 --> 14:40.840
- Go away.
- Come on, man.

14:40.920 --> 14:43.480
I just got to get something out of the...
I got to get...

14:43.560 --> 14:46.320
Goddamn, man, can't you see
I'm busy back here?

14:46.400 --> 14:47.520
Shit, that's a lot of woman.

14:47.600 --> 14:50.126
Yeah, what you want that's so important
you got to crash my love den?

14:50.240 --> 14:52.000
You're going to give
that man a heart attack.

14:52.080 --> 14:55.163
Tell it again, I don't get it.
Who had the cake?

14:56.280 --> 14:59.520
Christ, bitch, pay attention this time.

14:59.600 --> 15:02.520
There was a boy named Harold.

15:02.600 --> 15:04.600
Walked in on his grandparents having sex.

15:04.680 --> 15:08.040
Pretty much like this asshole
don' walked in on me.

15:08.120 --> 15:11.520
Harold said, "Grandma!
What are you doing?"

15:11.600 --> 15:14.604
Grandma say, "Well, we baking a cake.

15:15.480 --> 15:17.482
A few days later, Harold say...

15:17.600 --> 15:21.120
"Grandma, was you and Grandpa
baking a cake last night?

15:21.200 --> 15:23.480
Grandma says, "Matter of fact, we was.

15:23.560 --> 15:25.000
How do you know?"

15:25.080 --> 15:29.520
Harold say, "Because I just licked
some frosting off the couch."

15:29.600 --> 15:31.720
I still don't get it.

15:31.800 --> 15:33.400
The frosting, where did it come from?

15:33.480 --> 15:35.760
The old man's dick.

15:35.840 --> 15:38.286
The old bastard's jizz was the frosting.

15:42.480 --> 15:45.131
Hello, Congo. How I missed you.

15:46.120 --> 15:47.880
Come on, Roscoe,
go get your ass out of here.

15:47.960 --> 15:50.840
I'll get out in a second.
What do you think?

15:50.920 --> 15:53.320
I think it's cute. It isn't cute.

15:53.400 --> 15:54.845
So do I.

15:57.600 --> 16:00.720
Rosco, get your ass out of here.
You got to go, now, man.

16:00.800 --> 16:04.160
Go on, man. Goddamn.

16:04.240 --> 16:07.200
- Spoiled the...
- Come here.

16:07.280 --> 16:10.360
Hey, see?

16:10.440 --> 16:13.091
It still looks boss. Okay?

16:13.200 --> 16:15.440
- Okay, I'll think about it.
- I just have to clean it up a little.

16:15.520 --> 16:18.126
I'll think about it, King Dong,
I'll think about it.

17:00.880 --> 17:03.480
Hey, oldie.

17:03.560 --> 17:04.760
Got any gas today?

17:04.839 --> 17:08.079
It's a cock-sucking gas station, ain't it?

17:08.160 --> 17:10.685
All right then, fill up
this big bitch pronto.

17:11.599 --> 17:13.000
Any of you dumb cunts...

17:13.079 --> 17:16.079
in that ridiculous machine
know how to read?

17:16.160 --> 17:18.891
Or are you still using sign language?

17:20.800 --> 17:23.406
Yeah, old man, I know how to read.

17:24.960 --> 17:27.440
Then read it and weep, genius.

17:27.520 --> 17:30.200
Bad sign.

17:30.280 --> 17:33.648
Got a whole lot of lazy effers here
in this world, man.

17:55.080 --> 17:56.720
You digging what you see, pops?

17:56.800 --> 17:58.609
I reckon I do.

18:02.320 --> 18:04.402
You can call me Leo.

18:04.520 --> 18:07.280
Lucky Leo, if you know what I mean.

18:07.360 --> 18:10.000
Really? Do you feel lucky?

18:10.080 --> 18:12.440
I got a mattress out back...

18:12.520 --> 18:14.488
and a couple of jugs of gut burner.

18:17.080 --> 18:18.560
Trust me, Leo.

18:18.640 --> 18:21.291
Your prehistoric ticker
couldn't survive the ride.

18:23.600 --> 18:24.840
Charly...

18:24.920 --> 18:27.080
Stop fucking with the locals.

18:27.160 --> 18:29.680
Give me a break.

18:29.760 --> 18:31.762
I'm just making friends.

18:31.880 --> 18:34.200
You want to be my friend, don't you, Leo?

18:34.280 --> 18:36.089
You know I do.

18:37.200 --> 18:39.726
See? Just making friends.

18:42.480 --> 18:45.324
You've had enough friends for a lifetime.

18:52.600 --> 18:54.880
Nice puppets, Leo.

18:54.960 --> 18:56.405
You play with that stuff?

18:57.960 --> 19:00.566
I bet you do.

19:03.120 --> 19:06.120
The good Lord pray me for every day

19:06.200 --> 19:08.885
He want me to leave a righteous way

19:09.000 --> 19:12.080
So I don't care what the white man say

19:12.160 --> 19:15.880
Santa Claus is a black man

19:15.960 --> 19:18.800
You know, I'm thinking man,
when we get ourself a break...

19:18.880 --> 19:21.040
we need to check out
the sound system in the carousel.

19:21.120 --> 19:23.521
Man, them speakers, man,
they shot up to shit.

19:23.640 --> 19:26.560
Seriously though, it looks like
I'm losing my shit.

19:26.640 --> 19:28.280
I don't normally have this much forehead.

19:28.360 --> 19:29.885
Too young for that.

19:31.200 --> 19:35.040
Hey, man, look, it gonna do
what it gonna do.

19:35.120 --> 19:36.640
Yeah, but that's easy for you to say.

19:36.720 --> 19:40.800
Shit take a goddamn nuclear blast
to damage that foxy do of yours.

19:40.880 --> 19:44.160
My shit goes south.
I can't do no Isaac Hayes.

19:44.240 --> 19:45.600
Will you teach us something?

19:45.680 --> 19:48.640
I'm gonna teach you something.
I'm not gonna let anyone hurt you.

19:48.720 --> 19:52.480
There's only four things
you need to know about this career.

19:52.560 --> 19:56.520
This is the answer to it all!

19:56.600 --> 19:58.840
All right.

19:58.920 --> 20:01.960
Sucky, sucky, sucky.

20:02.040 --> 20:04.320
Fucky, fucky, fucky.

20:04.400 --> 20:07.483
Juicy, juicy, juicy.

20:07.600 --> 20:10.444
Money, money, money!

20:28.840 --> 20:30.922
Hey, sailor.

20:31.040 --> 20:33.486
How many seaman you got in that tin can?

20:34.920 --> 20:36.600
Too many.

20:36.680 --> 20:38.520
Why, you need a lift?

20:38.600 --> 20:41.240
Maybe.

20:41.320 --> 20:43.480
I could fit in very tight spaces.

20:43.560 --> 20:46.404
I bet you can.

20:48.680 --> 20:50.489
So can I.

20:51.760 --> 20:53.840
Y'all headed up Jackson way to go hunting?

20:53.920 --> 20:57.720
No, we're just plowing straight
on through to Harleyville.

21:06.320 --> 21:07.970
Planning on doing some hunting?

21:09.160 --> 21:12.323
No. Why are you so concerned
with me going hunting?

21:13.520 --> 21:15.160
Just wondering.

21:15.240 --> 21:19.360
You got that domineering
great white hunter vibe.

21:19.440 --> 21:21.681
Yeah, it just comes natural.

21:23.480 --> 21:26.480
But we ain't got nothing
about any firearms on this truck...

21:26.560 --> 21:28.164
other than a busted old shotgun.

21:29.480 --> 21:30.680
What's it for?

21:30.760 --> 21:33.127
Propping open the air vent.

21:41.960 --> 21:43.760
What if you get in a jam?

21:43.840 --> 21:45.968
Well then I guess I...

21:48.200 --> 21:50.120
bust out my old trusty crowbar...

21:50.200 --> 21:53.488
and back it up with one of these guns.

21:57.120 --> 22:00.010
Pop. See you later, Popeye.

22:00.920 --> 22:03.685
I'ma go get me some spinach.

22:04.560 --> 22:05.971
Yeah, you are.

22:15.040 --> 22:17.560
That's the Moon Man Halloween Party...

22:17.640 --> 22:20.530
on the night that was made for howling.

22:23.880 --> 22:25.720
...we bring you the Wolf Man Jack...

22:25.800 --> 22:27.640
Make-Believe Graveyard Ball.

22:27.720 --> 22:33.090
Starring the leader of the gang
at the fang, Wolf Man Jack.

22:34.360 --> 22:37.921
Oh, boy. Good evening and...

22:38.040 --> 22:39.560
Oh, shit.

22:39.640 --> 22:42.080
What the fuck is this shit?

22:42.160 --> 22:45.721
...we got our big
Monster Mash Party going here.

22:49.920 --> 22:52.048
Yo, Fats, why are you stopping?

22:53.000 --> 22:57.120
Just because some hillbilly
sets up a Halloween la-la...

22:57.200 --> 23:00.120
in the middle of the goddamn road.

23:00.200 --> 23:03.680
- Move this shit to the side of the road.
- Why me?

23:03.760 --> 23:06.680
Come on, man, you know it's easier
for you to get out than it is for Randy.

23:06.760 --> 23:08.888
Thank you.

23:13.560 --> 23:16.320
Mr. Monkey, I'll go with you.

23:16.400 --> 23:20.960
You ought to know what man checks you.

23:21.040 --> 23:23.725
Hey, Panda, wake up.
Come on out and help us.

23:25.240 --> 23:29.290
Jesus Christ, every time
I get comfortable.

23:38.640 --> 23:42.361
I'm telling you
this is one big-time party.

23:42.480 --> 23:43.641
What the hell is this?

23:46.240 --> 23:47.810
This voodoo, man.

23:49.760 --> 23:52.730
Voodoo schmoodoo,
let's move this stuff off.

23:55.640 --> 23:57.563
Come on, go.

23:59.560 --> 24:01.324
What the fuck?

24:02.880 --> 24:04.644
Come on go!

24:05.560 --> 24:06.686
Oh, shit!

24:29.600 --> 24:31.840
The Wolf Man Jack Show.

24:31.920 --> 24:33.920
Well, I say all good things
got to come to an end...

24:34.000 --> 24:36.880
and this is the end
of the line for us today.

24:36.960 --> 24:41.040
And we sure have enjoyed having you's
all here with me and everything.

24:41.120 --> 24:44.160
And I know y'all have enjoyed being had.

24:44.240 --> 24:45.810
Come back next time, and remember...

24:45.920 --> 24:47.809
the old Wolf Man loves y'all.
Bye, everybody.

25:13.320 --> 25:15.280
I bid you welcome...

25:15.360 --> 25:19.120
oh, nameless and numbered ones.

25:19.200 --> 25:24.331
Tonight, we are going to play 31.

25:25.840 --> 25:28.889
What is 31, pray tell?

25:29.520 --> 25:33.000
Well, 31 is war.

25:33.080 --> 25:35.320
And as the old saying goes...

25:35.400 --> 25:38.722
war is hell.

25:40.480 --> 25:45.800
In exactly 120 seconds, we will begin.

25:45.880 --> 25:48.720
And all you have to do...

25:48.800 --> 25:51.160
is survive 12 hours...

25:51.240 --> 25:56.565
inside the walls
of our own private little hell.

25:58.080 --> 25:59.840
And now...

25:59.920 --> 26:04.160
for the survival odds, as we see fit.

26:04.240 --> 26:08.280
Number one, 50 to 1.

26:08.360 --> 26:11.728
Number two, 500 to 1.

26:11.840 --> 26:15.360
Number three, 100 to 1.

26:15.440 --> 26:18.480
Number four, 60 to 1.

26:18.560 --> 26:22.720
Number five, 500 to 1.

26:22.800 --> 26:26.000
Now, what do you have to do to survive?

26:26.080 --> 26:28.000
Fear not.

26:28.080 --> 26:31.520
We have some very
colorful heads for you tonight.

26:31.600 --> 26:34.040
And they're here for one reason...

26:34.120 --> 26:37.124
and for one reason only.

26:37.240 --> 26:42.880
To kill you in the most
violent way possible.

26:42.960 --> 26:46.200
Feast your eyes and behold.

26:46.280 --> 26:49.363
Sick-Head.

26:55.120 --> 26:59.364
Happy Halloween, motherfuckers.

27:00.440 --> 27:02.360
Number five.

27:02.440 --> 27:04.886
Blond whore. I'm going to bang you hard.

27:06.240 --> 27:10.802
Number four. Worthless tramp.

27:14.240 --> 27:17.164
Number three. Retarded gringo.

27:17.280 --> 27:19.044
Stupid.

27:20.520 --> 27:22.880
Number two.

27:22.960 --> 27:26.880
Tired little bitch.

27:26.960 --> 27:29.120
Number one.

27:29.200 --> 27:30.406
Filthy scum.

27:32.800 --> 27:34.564
A competition will be nice.

27:38.320 --> 27:40.480
Now, do not be fooled...

27:40.560 --> 27:44.120
by the man-beast I put before you.

27:44.200 --> 27:47.886
This is a true world-class warrior.

27:48.880 --> 27:50.769
He lives to kill.

27:52.000 --> 27:56.767
Sick-Head will not go gentle
into this good night.

27:57.800 --> 27:58.920
No, I won't.

27:59.000 --> 28:03.608
Thirty-one has begun!

28:19.600 --> 28:21.960
Welcome to 31.

28:22.040 --> 28:25.760
You now have exactly 12 hours to play.

28:25.840 --> 28:27.410
Happy Halloween.

29:10.320 --> 29:11.924
Fucker.

29:49.240 --> 29:50.200
Jesus, man.

29:50.280 --> 29:52.169
- You almost goddamn it...
- No shit.

30:00.840 --> 30:03.491
- See anybody else?
- Negative.

30:23.040 --> 30:26.761
The average human is quite resilient.

30:27.520 --> 30:30.280
Events that disgust us one minute...

30:30.360 --> 30:34.410
quickly become infinitely
acceptable the next.

30:35.200 --> 30:38.640
Sometimes, the weak ones
have the most fight...

30:38.720 --> 30:42.120
or perhaps they're just
the luckiest, I don't know.

30:42.200 --> 30:44.960
But as we like to say around here...

30:45.040 --> 30:49.887
the dirtier you work, the luckier you get.

30:57.520 --> 30:59.760
Sounds like it's coming from this room.

30:59.840 --> 31:03.440
- It could be a trap.
- This whole goddamn business is a trap.

31:03.520 --> 31:06.640
Okay, okay, I'm going to slide the door.

31:06.720 --> 31:08.290
Get ready with the pipe.

31:28.080 --> 31:30.481
Pull it off.

31:42.600 --> 31:43.761
I thought it was Charly.

31:53.080 --> 31:56.004
I've never been
so fucking happy I was wrong.

31:58.960 --> 32:00.962
Fuck.

32:02.800 --> 32:05.041
What is this fucking place?

32:37.920 --> 32:39.843
Number four.

32:41.000 --> 32:42.286
Are you afraid?

32:44.440 --> 32:46.169
Are you looking for me?

32:47.360 --> 32:48.360
Here I am.

32:48.440 --> 32:50.044
Open the fucking gate.

32:53.520 --> 32:56.729
I'm going to put this fucking knife
so far up your fucking ass.

32:58.760 --> 32:59.760
I might like that.

32:59.840 --> 33:01.569
You're a fucking Chihuahua.

33:05.160 --> 33:06.844
You think it's funny?

33:06.960 --> 33:08.724
You are funny.

33:08.840 --> 33:10.560
Open the fucking gate.

33:10.640 --> 33:12.760
Fuck you.

33:12.840 --> 33:14.360
I'm coming for you, boy.

33:14.440 --> 33:17.400
Number four always dies first.

33:17.480 --> 33:19.880
We're going to get so friendly...

33:19.960 --> 33:21.760
it's going to kill you.

33:21.840 --> 33:23.720
I'm fucking coming for you.

33:23.800 --> 33:25.880
We'll see, fagot.

33:25.960 --> 33:27.600
Open the fucking gate.

33:27.680 --> 33:30.047
"Open the fucking gate."

33:31.760 --> 33:34.080
I'm coming for you.

33:34.160 --> 33:36.400
- "I'm coming for you."
- I'm fucking coming for you.

33:36.480 --> 33:39.529
"I'm fucking coming for you."

34:36.440 --> 34:40.320
Trick or treat, you are dead...

34:40.400 --> 34:44.639
I will smash your fucking head.

34:44.719 --> 34:48.520
Trick or treat, you are dead...

34:48.600 --> 34:53.560
I will smash your fucking head.

34:53.639 --> 34:58.240
Trick or treat, you are dead...

34:58.320 --> 35:03.611
I will smash your fucking head.

35:05.120 --> 35:09.560
Trick or treat, you are dead...

35:09.640 --> 35:13.884
I will smash your fucking head!

36:27.840 --> 36:30.280
Girl! Cool it with the bat.

36:30.360 --> 36:32.089
I'm on your side.

36:34.320 --> 36:37.961
Come on now, child,
let's get the fuck out of here.

36:52.920 --> 36:54.840
- Fuck.
- Goddamn bitch.

36:54.920 --> 36:56.285
You something with that slugger.

36:56.400 --> 36:59.000
- Is he dead?
- I don't know.

36:59.080 --> 37:00.920
Son of a bitch, I think I broke his neck.

37:01.000 --> 37:02.600
Shit, where did he get me?

37:02.680 --> 37:04.960
- I think in the shoulder blade.
- Fuck!

37:05.040 --> 37:07.880
I got to stop the bleeding.
Here, put some pressure here.

37:07.960 --> 37:09.640
God!

37:09.720 --> 37:11.245
Fuck that...

37:11.960 --> 37:13.724
Hello, whore. Hello, bitch.

37:16.560 --> 37:19.040
- Come one.
- Get away from me!

37:19.960 --> 37:22.040
Get away from me. Come on.

37:22.120 --> 37:25.520
- Come on. Get away.
- I'll stick it right up your ass.

37:25.600 --> 37:27.840
Come on.

37:27.920 --> 37:29.200
You want to play with me, bitch?

37:29.280 --> 37:32.090
- Come here.
- Yes, I'm going.

37:36.760 --> 37:38.720
- You're crazy.
- Do you want it?

37:38.800 --> 37:40.404
I like it that way.

37:41.600 --> 37:43.682
Who is the bitch now, huh?

37:46.440 --> 37:47.880
You want?

37:47.960 --> 37:49.920
- You want to play with me?
- Yes.

37:50.000 --> 37:51.840
You're crazy, bitch.

37:51.920 --> 37:53.400
I'm out of my mind.

37:53.480 --> 37:55.200
Run, bitch. Run.

37:55.280 --> 37:57.520
Run. Run.

37:57.600 --> 38:00.046
Run. Run, run, run.

38:04.320 --> 38:06.641
You better run, number five.

38:06.760 --> 38:08.520
'Cause I'm gonna go kill number four...

38:08.600 --> 38:10.400
and then I'm gonna come back for you...

38:10.480 --> 38:12.400
and I'm gonna kill you nice and slow.

38:12.480 --> 38:16.080
Okay? Run and hide.

38:16.160 --> 38:17.440
- Go hide.
- Fuck!

38:17.520 --> 38:18.726
Go hide.

38:22.760 --> 38:23.880
Damn.

38:23.960 --> 38:27.240
Ten hours and forty-three minutes.

38:27.320 --> 38:29.846
Anything can still happen.

38:33.440 --> 38:35.602
Hello, fagot.

38:36.640 --> 38:38.040
How are you?

38:38.120 --> 38:41.960
You thought I left. No, you owe me money.

38:42.040 --> 38:45.203
Don't you remember, dickhead?
Don't you remember?

38:48.800 --> 38:51.200
How do you want to die, huh?

38:51.280 --> 38:52.486
How do you want to die?

38:53.360 --> 38:55.681
Does that hurt, huh?

38:59.280 --> 39:01.044
Are you okay?

39:07.040 --> 39:08.440
I thought you were my brother.

39:08.520 --> 39:10.920
- Fuck you, boy.
- Fuck you.

39:11.000 --> 39:12.640
- Fuck you.
- Fuck you.

39:12.720 --> 39:14.880
- Fuck you!
- Fuck you.

39:14.960 --> 39:16.246
Fuck...

39:19.480 --> 39:20.600
You ready to die?

39:20.680 --> 39:22.364
Just fucking do it.

39:23.880 --> 39:26.087
Just fucking do it!

40:09.600 --> 40:11.602
Where are you?

40:11.720 --> 40:14.320
The wolf is here.

40:14.400 --> 40:16.846
Where are you, little bitch?

40:18.240 --> 40:19.680
Where are you?

40:19.760 --> 40:22.280
You want to play with the devil.

40:22.360 --> 40:24.960
The wolf is here.

40:25.040 --> 40:27.884
Where are you, huh?

40:30.120 --> 40:32.521
Number five.

40:46.280 --> 40:49.960
Hold up, do you hear that?

40:50.040 --> 40:51.201
Charly.

41:00.960 --> 41:02.166
Get away!

41:04.960 --> 41:07.760
Strike two. Give me the bat.

41:07.840 --> 41:09.560
Give me the bat.

41:09.640 --> 41:13.240
Today you're going to die
for being stupid.

41:13.320 --> 41:15.243
Come here.

41:18.680 --> 41:20.648
I'm going to give you a hard one.

41:53.200 --> 41:54.725
You've got it, bitch.

41:57.480 --> 41:58.811
Again.

41:59.960 --> 42:01.485
Again.

42:11.840 --> 42:13.410
Let go of me.

42:19.840 --> 42:21.888
My fucking bat!

42:31.680 --> 42:34.680
I got you, brother. I got you.

42:34.760 --> 42:37.127
I can't believe this is happening.

42:37.240 --> 42:39.360
It's all right. I got you.

42:39.440 --> 42:41.920
I'm too young. Too pretty.

42:42.000 --> 42:45.120
I know, baby. I know.

42:45.200 --> 42:48.160
- Hey, Panda.
- Yeah, baby.

42:48.240 --> 42:50.440
Your momma...

42:50.520 --> 42:53.080
- She...
- No.

42:53.160 --> 42:56.880
She said she was my momma, too.

42:56.960 --> 43:00.520
That I was her son from another mother.

43:00.600 --> 43:03.968
- She say...
- You the brother, like no other, yes.

43:04.960 --> 43:08.960
I... I feel...

43:09.040 --> 43:10.840
I feel tired.

43:10.920 --> 43:14.163
Really, really tired.

43:37.600 --> 43:40.604
Jesus Christ. Jesus Christ.

44:00.080 --> 44:04.085
I do believe the first kill
came rather quickly this year.

44:04.200 --> 44:06.560
I'm rather disappointed.

44:06.640 --> 44:08.200
The first one always does.

44:08.280 --> 44:12.520
It's the second one,
the second one has all the drama.

44:12.600 --> 44:15.809
Well, I certainly hope
we see a better showing

44:15.920 --> 44:17.440
from the remaining remnants.

44:17.520 --> 44:21.889
We shall see, we shall see.

44:38.000 --> 44:43.840
As we slip into our third hour
of non-stop 31 action...

44:43.920 --> 44:47.925
come and enjoy some exquisite dining.

44:48.840 --> 44:51.640
You may want to try
the steak kidney pie...

44:51.720 --> 44:54.291
followed by the apple crumble.

44:55.320 --> 44:57.640
Delicious.

44:57.720 --> 44:59.960
For one of you...

45:00.040 --> 45:04.204
this, of course,
might be your last supper.

45:06.880 --> 45:09.240
Those twisted fuckers.

45:09.320 --> 45:11.520
Fuck.

45:11.600 --> 45:13.960
This is impressive.

45:14.040 --> 45:17.120
I hate to admit, but this layout...

45:17.200 --> 45:21.171
oh, man, it looks better
than me mother's New Year's brunch.

45:21.280 --> 45:24.170
Yeah, and I assume
it's all laced with rat poisoning.

45:24.280 --> 45:25.760
No, I'm relatively sure it's safe.

45:25.840 --> 45:28.002
Seriously?

45:28.120 --> 45:29.920
What could possibly make you say that?

45:30.000 --> 45:32.765
Because we're playing their game.

45:35.960 --> 45:39.000
Fuck it. Fuck it, fuck it.

45:39.080 --> 45:41.731
My stomach's so empty,
it's touching me back.

45:44.840 --> 45:46.365
Yeah, man.

45:48.120 --> 45:49.360
Are you enjoying that?

45:50.120 --> 45:51.167
Yeah, man.

45:58.400 --> 45:59.760
I feel it.

45:59.840 --> 46:03.400
I feel all of y'all looking at me.

46:03.480 --> 46:05.130
You're judging. Don't.

46:06.840 --> 46:08.683
I ain't made of stone.

46:12.240 --> 46:15.120
Look, man. What happened to me, man...

46:15.200 --> 46:19.200
Levon back there, man,
it's fucking horrible.

46:19.280 --> 46:22.960
I mean, man, he was my best-est friend
in the whole goddamn world...

46:23.040 --> 46:25.360
before any of you mothers
come in the picture!

46:25.440 --> 46:28.720
Your best-est friend's blood
is all over my hands.

46:28.800 --> 46:35.280
And that's why I and I gonna stay alive.

46:35.360 --> 46:38.760
I don't do it on an empty stomach.

46:38.840 --> 46:41.241
So you, you and you...

46:41.360 --> 46:44.489
I suggest y'all do the same thing.

46:47.360 --> 46:48.691
Fuck it.

46:54.200 --> 46:55.840
I take it they're out watching us, right?

46:55.920 --> 46:58.720
You bet your sweet skunk ass
they're watching.

46:58.800 --> 47:00.320
And listening.

47:00.400 --> 47:02.880
So keep your breathy thoughts to yourself.

47:02.960 --> 47:05.930
You know, we can do this.
We just have to stay together.

47:08.120 --> 47:09.531
Charly.

47:11.520 --> 47:13.170
Charly.

47:14.240 --> 47:16.163
What?

47:18.680 --> 47:23.760
What is going on inside your head?

47:23.840 --> 47:26.480
You want to know what's going on
inside my head?

47:26.560 --> 47:29.880
I'll fucking tell you what's going on
inside my head.

47:29.960 --> 47:33.600
We need better weapons than this shit.

47:33.680 --> 47:36.081
You're goddamn right, girly.

47:40.080 --> 47:44.040
Hey, anybody remember that story
last year, Halloween...

47:44.120 --> 47:45.920
that church group that went missing?

47:46.000 --> 47:48.520
Yeah, I remember hearing
something about that.

47:48.600 --> 47:51.400
Just recently on the TV they found
the body of the pastor...

47:51.480 --> 47:53.209
- In the dumpster.
- ...rotting in dumpster.

47:54.400 --> 47:56.680
Holy shit. That's gonna be us.

47:56.760 --> 47:58.920
- Come on.
- No, two-second news story.

47:59.000 --> 48:01.120
You know, and we're forgotten.

48:01.200 --> 48:03.931
- All right, all right, all right.
- Not by me.

48:06.240 --> 48:07.360
Stop eating.

48:07.440 --> 48:09.329
Why, why, what wrong?

48:12.520 --> 48:13.521
Spit it out.

48:38.640 --> 48:40.920
Let's get the fuck out of here.

48:41.000 --> 48:42.080
What the fuck?

48:42.160 --> 48:44.440
I sincerely hope you all enjoyed...

48:44.520 --> 48:48.320
your protein-enriched nourishments.

48:48.400 --> 48:53.040
The first re-assessment
of the standings are as follows.

48:53.120 --> 48:56.480
Number one, 50 to 1 odds.

48:56.560 --> 49:00.280
Number three at 90 to 1.

49:00.360 --> 49:02.931
Number two at 300 to 1.

49:03.040 --> 49:08.649
And last but not least
is number five, 400 to 1.

49:12.320 --> 49:15.680
Ladies and gentlemen,
boys and girls, children of all ages...

49:15.760 --> 49:19.000
with exactly nine hours left to play...

49:19.080 --> 49:22.200
I give you Psycho-Head and his brother...

49:22.280 --> 49:25.887
the maniacally mental Schizo-Head.

49:27.280 --> 49:29.601
- There's two of them.
- Don't scatter.

49:30.560 --> 49:33.440
Oh, goddamn.

49:33.520 --> 49:36.440
We ain't got a fucking thing
to worry about this year, brother.

49:36.520 --> 49:40.880
Look at these sorry sacks
of wasted meat shit.

49:40.960 --> 49:44.009
Do we have your attention now,
mother fuckers?

49:45.280 --> 49:46.640
You smell that?

49:46.720 --> 49:49.480
Well, I think they're already
pissing in their pants.

49:49.560 --> 49:52.723
Yeah. Now, you think you got one over...

49:52.840 --> 49:55.920
because you took out
that little shot glass bitch Sick-Head.

49:56.000 --> 49:57.604
Well, he isn't worth a shit.

49:57.720 --> 50:00.485
The only thing he's good for
is shooting out of a fucking cannon.

50:00.600 --> 50:03.160
And I don't see a fucking cannon.
Do you see a fucking cannon?

50:03.240 --> 50:04.401
No cannon.

50:04.520 --> 50:07.640
So that means you killed half a man.

50:07.720 --> 50:09.000
And it took five of you...

50:09.080 --> 50:12.360
to kill a little itty bitty baby.

50:12.440 --> 50:14.360
Shit.

50:14.440 --> 50:16.480
Hello, ladies.

50:16.560 --> 50:19.880
I am all man, and I am coming for you.

50:19.960 --> 50:22.122
We're gonna fuck all your holes.

50:23.640 --> 50:25.240
Count yourselves lucky.

50:25.320 --> 50:27.368
You got fucked by the best.

50:34.440 --> 50:38.570
Eight hours and twelve minutes.

50:38.680 --> 50:42.207
The fun is just beginning.

50:54.800 --> 50:56.720
I don't hear them anymore.

50:56.800 --> 50:58.960
- Me neither.
- Listen.

50:59.040 --> 51:00.960
I think we should find a room.

51:01.040 --> 51:04.160
Barricade ourselves in. Wait it out.

51:04.240 --> 51:05.400
I second the barricade idea.

51:05.480 --> 51:07.680
I'm sick of this hide-and-seek horse shit.

51:07.760 --> 51:09.600
Got to use your head.

51:09.680 --> 51:12.680
They don't want for us to be sitting
around all night on our back side.

51:12.760 --> 51:15.240
Okay, hold on. Charly, we haven't
heard you in the last half an hour.

51:15.320 --> 51:18.244
What do you say, huh?
Your vote counts like mine.

51:21.440 --> 51:24.205
I say we hunt these freaks down
and slit their fucking throats.

51:26.000 --> 51:28.526
All right.

51:44.440 --> 51:46.560
Gonna fuck your pussy hole.

51:46.640 --> 51:49.600
We're gonna fuck
that tiny little brown hole.

51:49.680 --> 51:51.440
And we're gonna fuck your eye hole, too.

51:51.520 --> 51:54.600
A cock in each motherfucking socket.

51:54.680 --> 51:57.480
We're gonna fuck your mouth hole.

51:57.560 --> 51:59.688
We're gonna fuck your pussy hole.

51:59.800 --> 52:02.720
We're gonna fuck that tiny
little brown hole.

52:02.800 --> 52:05.326
And we're gonna fuck your eye hole, too.

52:07.280 --> 52:08.441
What's that sound?

52:10.600 --> 52:11.886
Do you hear it?

52:14.080 --> 52:15.206
It's coming from the fuck doll.

52:31.200 --> 52:32.565
That's no fucking doll.

52:44.280 --> 52:46.080
Jesus Christ, oh, God!

52:46.160 --> 52:48.920
- Panda. Panda.
- What the fuck?

52:49.000 --> 52:51.810
Don't flip out on me now, man. Come on.

52:55.200 --> 52:57.360
Help me, please.

52:57.440 --> 52:59.960
I need to go home.
Everyone is waiting for me.

53:00.040 --> 53:01.041
Sweet Jesus.

53:02.080 --> 53:03.280
Help me untie her.

53:03.360 --> 53:05.360
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

53:05.440 --> 53:06.640
What's your name, honey?

53:06.720 --> 53:09.480
- Georgina Victor.
- Georgina.

53:09.560 --> 53:11.560
But my husband calls me little Georgie.

53:11.640 --> 53:14.800
Hold the fuck up, hold the fuck up.

53:14.880 --> 53:17.720
- Put me the fuck down.
- Panda, what do you think?

53:17.800 --> 53:20.120
We don't take the chance
and let her run loose.

53:20.200 --> 53:22.362
She ain't one of them.

53:24.600 --> 53:27.440
Look at her. Look at her.

53:27.520 --> 53:30.400
She might be somebody's
daughter for all I know.

53:30.480 --> 53:32.800
This is getting crazy around here.

53:32.880 --> 53:34.640
Shut the fuck up.

53:34.720 --> 53:36.440
Panda, shut the fuck up.

53:36.520 --> 53:38.560
He's right, this is not a good idea.

53:38.640 --> 53:41.689
Please, please, I know a way out.

53:43.600 --> 53:45.680
- I've heard them talking.
- I believe you.

53:45.760 --> 53:47.603
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

53:48.440 --> 53:49.920
Shit, they fucking found us.

53:50.000 --> 53:51.160
We got to secure the door.

53:51.240 --> 53:53.640
I knew it. I fucking knew it.

53:53.720 --> 53:56.200
She sounded the alarm.
She sounded the fucking alarm.

53:56.280 --> 53:57.680
You psycho fucking bitch.

53:57.760 --> 54:01.320
Yeah, I know you.
Tallahassee, Moline. I know you.

54:01.400 --> 54:02.560
Shut the fuck up, Roscoe.

54:02.640 --> 54:04.608
You don't listen to me.
You do not listen to me.

54:07.800 --> 54:09.200
Look at her. Look at her.

54:09.280 --> 54:10.360
Fucking asshole.

54:10.440 --> 54:11.440
You are falling for her.

54:11.520 --> 54:15.880
We've got to get something
to block off the door.

54:15.960 --> 54:17.800
How about one of these pipes?

54:17.880 --> 54:19.200
Look at me, look at me.

54:19.280 --> 54:20.960
Are you fucking going to help me or not?

54:21.040 --> 54:22.929
Look at me.

54:26.640 --> 54:27.846
Fuck.

54:29.640 --> 54:30.766
Fuck!

54:33.440 --> 54:35.727
Bless you. Bless you.

54:39.560 --> 54:42.200
I can't get the wires.

54:42.280 --> 54:44.009
- It's in her fucking skin.
- Rip it out.

54:45.640 --> 54:47.320
Think it'll hold?

54:47.400 --> 54:48.447
No.

54:51.240 --> 54:52.401
Get me out of here!

54:54.800 --> 54:56.450
Fuck!

55:02.240 --> 55:04.080
I knew it. I knew it.

55:04.160 --> 55:05.560
You fucking bitch.

55:05.640 --> 55:07.680
It's a fucking cage.

55:07.760 --> 55:10.081
Goddamn it. It's a fucking cage.

55:17.280 --> 55:18.884
Check the back.

55:19.000 --> 55:21.200
Goddamn it. I knew it.

55:21.280 --> 55:24.921
I knew it. Goddamn it.
Nobody listens to me.

55:36.840 --> 55:39.002
Hi, there, Momma. You miss me?

55:53.520 --> 55:55.800
Georgie!

55:55.880 --> 55:58.160
Look what the fucking cat drug in.

55:58.240 --> 56:00.440
Two blind mice.

56:00.520 --> 56:02.680
See how they're dumb.

56:02.760 --> 56:06.003
Even the fucking mice know how
to get out of the maze, motherfuckers.

56:13.160 --> 56:14.480
Looks like I need a new fuck bag.

56:14.560 --> 56:17.484
And after I get done
with pork chop, you're it.

56:17.600 --> 56:19.920
Venus, get behind me.

56:20.000 --> 56:21.320
You got to go through me for her.

56:21.400 --> 56:23.368
You're gonna be my fuck bag.
Come on, bring it.

56:23.480 --> 56:26.200
All that chivalry
is worthless, motherfucker.

56:26.280 --> 56:27.480
Like tits on a boar hog.

56:27.560 --> 56:31.281
- Come on, bitch.
- Meet Mr. Fucking Dick Head, sideburns.

56:39.240 --> 56:40.765
Panda!

57:18.320 --> 57:19.606
You fucking bitch.

57:22.680 --> 57:25.331
You do like to make it happen,
don't you, bitch?

57:35.240 --> 57:37.561
No, I'll never fucking die!

58:11.440 --> 58:13.280
I don't want to die.

58:13.360 --> 58:16.569
I don't want to be here.
They make me be here.

58:17.760 --> 58:20.840
We're all pawns in this stupid game.

58:20.920 --> 58:22.604
We don't want to do it.

58:23.400 --> 58:26.840
You and me, we're the same.

58:26.920 --> 58:28.604
We're the same, brother.

58:33.160 --> 58:34.207
Okay, brother.

59:07.760 --> 59:09.125
That thing's gonna come in handy.

59:15.360 --> 59:17.567
Fuck.

59:20.840 --> 59:22.600
All right, Roscoe, I got you, I got you.

59:22.680 --> 59:25.160
Let's get out of here
before that damn thing slams shut again.

59:25.240 --> 59:28.084
Charly, pick up that other chainsaw.

59:29.440 --> 59:31.488
- Fucking chain snapped.
- Leave it.

59:32.480 --> 59:33.480
Fuck.

59:33.560 --> 59:36.609
Seven hours and three minutes.

59:37.680 --> 59:41.760
I believe it's time
to recalculate the odds.

59:41.840 --> 59:45.640
Prepare to open your purses.

59:52.560 --> 59:54.164
Shit.

59:58.320 --> 59:59.520
How fucked am I?

59:59.600 --> 01:00:02.200
I don't know, man. It looks pretty bad.

01:00:02.280 --> 01:00:04.360
Yeah, it feels pretty bad.

01:00:04.440 --> 01:00:08.520
You've got to get this
tight enough to keep it shut.

01:00:08.600 --> 01:00:12.480
What's that thing you say to the kids
coming out of the spook house in tears?

01:00:12.560 --> 01:00:15.200
- Why?
- Just tell me.

01:00:15.280 --> 01:00:20.650
Crying is for pussies,
so go grow a pair, you big baby.

01:00:20.760 --> 01:00:23.001
Get ready to grow a pair, you big baby.

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:27.161
God.

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:31.047
That wasn't so bad, huh?

01:00:34.120 --> 01:00:36.960
Attention, attention.

01:00:37.040 --> 01:00:40.120
Number one, odds 40 to 1.

01:00:40.200 --> 01:00:42.760
Number two, odds 300 to 1.

01:00:42.840 --> 01:00:46.731
Number three, one million to one.

01:00:48.120 --> 01:00:49.760
Fuck.

01:00:49.840 --> 01:00:53.720
Five, odds 300 to one.

01:00:53.800 --> 01:00:58.567
Sex and Death are on their way.

01:01:49.960 --> 01:01:52.440
What the fuck is going on?

01:01:53.760 --> 01:01:55.720
You see anything?

01:01:55.800 --> 01:01:59.640
All I see is a bunch of nothing.

01:01:59.720 --> 01:02:02.560
It seems crazy.

01:02:02.640 --> 01:02:04.800
Waiting here to be attacked.

01:02:04.880 --> 01:02:07.800
Running around with our heads cut off.

01:02:07.880 --> 01:02:09.882
Want to give us a chance
to get our heads cut off.

01:02:14.720 --> 01:02:16.165
Get the others.

01:02:20.920 --> 01:02:24.083
Come with me. Shit's going down.

01:02:25.360 --> 01:02:27.480
- Come on. Stay here.
- What are you talking about?

01:02:27.560 --> 01:02:28.686
Be right back.

01:02:35.560 --> 01:02:38.920
Ain't no way I going toe
to toe with that guy.

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:41.920
All right, my best play
is I circle around...

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:44.162
coldcock him from the back side.

01:02:44.280 --> 01:02:45.520
Now, once I'm in place...

01:02:45.600 --> 01:02:47.240
y'all create a distraction.

01:02:47.320 --> 01:02:50.210
Only gonna get one shot.
So you got to make it proper.

01:02:54.800 --> 01:02:59.442
Death has come to sing its quiet song.

01:03:00.480 --> 01:03:03.960
How they hide, for it won't be long.

01:03:04.040 --> 01:03:08.284
Death strikes once, and then it's gone.

01:03:10.720 --> 01:03:13.963
Where are you, you little fucking cunts?

01:03:14.880 --> 01:03:16.803
I want to see you.

01:03:26.360 --> 01:03:28.761
Fuck if I'm going to fucking stay here.

01:03:32.880 --> 01:03:35.121
Goddammit.

01:03:37.520 --> 01:03:40.240
- Come on.
- We're right here.

01:03:40.320 --> 01:03:41.845
Come on, come and get it.

01:03:45.680 --> 01:03:47.250
Baby, behind you.

01:04:14.800 --> 01:04:18.360
How nice.
The women are here to save the day.

01:04:18.440 --> 01:04:20.120
- Come on.
- Come, ladies, come here.

01:04:20.200 --> 01:04:22.600
- Panda, Panda.
- Come, come on.

01:04:22.680 --> 01:04:23.841
I want to fuck you!

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:33.367
I'm so scared.

01:04:45.080 --> 01:04:46.650
Hi.

01:04:55.200 --> 01:04:57.440
Great white hunter.

01:04:57.520 --> 01:04:59.204
What am I going to do with you?

01:05:01.360 --> 01:05:04.250
Would you like a lick of my lolly?

01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:10.360
I remember you.

01:05:10.440 --> 01:05:14.126
I'm so flattered you remember me.

01:05:15.600 --> 01:05:18.809
Is it hunting time now?

01:05:23.640 --> 01:05:25.165
Or how about now?

01:05:30.960 --> 01:05:33.680
Don't worry, Popeye.

01:05:33.760 --> 01:05:36.360
It's always someone's fault.

01:05:36.440 --> 01:05:39.840
Come here, bitch. Come and get me.

01:05:39.920 --> 01:05:44.403
Well, I am kind of high
from eating all my spinach.

01:05:46.040 --> 01:05:50.602
I guess maybe I should really
put you out of your misery.

01:05:56.120 --> 01:05:57.451
Fuck!

01:06:02.120 --> 01:06:03.406
Bitch.

01:07:12.520 --> 01:07:13.600
Fuck you.

01:07:13.680 --> 01:07:15.011
Motherfucker, come on.

01:07:24.360 --> 01:07:27.091
I can feel your fear.

01:07:28.600 --> 01:07:30.280
It's like a strange smell.

01:07:30.360 --> 01:07:32.089
- Hey!
- Scat!

01:07:41.040 --> 01:07:42.480
You want her?

01:07:42.560 --> 01:07:46.200
Then back off, or I'll slit
her fucking throat.

01:07:46.280 --> 01:07:49.120
No, no, no, don't, don't, don't.

01:07:49.200 --> 01:07:52.040
Don't hurt her.

01:07:52.120 --> 01:07:54.043
Don't do that. Don't do that.

01:08:02.120 --> 01:08:04.327
You can kill me.

01:08:05.800 --> 01:08:07.689
Venus.

01:08:09.920 --> 01:08:12.491
Baby, no!

01:08:13.920 --> 01:08:16.604
No!

01:08:21.800 --> 01:08:23.000
Baby. No!

01:08:23.080 --> 01:08:24.200
What are you waiting for?

01:08:24.279 --> 01:08:26.359
We can't.

01:08:26.439 --> 01:08:28.520
Do it. Do it.

01:08:28.600 --> 01:08:31.680
No! No! No!

01:08:31.760 --> 01:08:34.680
No!

01:08:34.760 --> 01:08:37.286
What do you want to do with her, Charly?

01:08:57.200 --> 01:08:58.760
What is the next step?

01:08:58.840 --> 01:09:04.240
We must calculate
the next step very carefully.

01:09:04.319 --> 01:09:06.479
Death-Head was our safety net.

01:09:06.560 --> 01:09:09.880
But since he has expired...

01:09:09.960 --> 01:09:13.080
Could I suggest Bash-Head?

01:09:13.160 --> 01:09:15.920
He can't be trusted
to close the deal properly, no.

01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:17.399
Fuck you, bitch.

01:09:17.479 --> 01:09:21.200
- Maybe Rage-Head.
- Too irrational.

01:09:21.279 --> 01:09:23.359
Fuck.

01:09:23.439 --> 01:09:27.399
I believe there is only one logical...

01:09:27.479 --> 01:09:29.640
and still compelling choice.

01:09:29.720 --> 01:09:31.640
Oh, yeah.

01:09:31.720 --> 01:09:34.080
Doom-Head.

01:09:34.160 --> 01:09:36.600
Fuck, fuck. Bitch.

01:09:36.680 --> 01:09:38.920
Are we in agreement on that decision?

01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:40.760
Agreed.

01:09:40.840 --> 01:09:42.600
Fucking yeah.

01:09:42.680 --> 01:09:44.399
It is Doom-Head.

01:09:44.479 --> 01:09:47.279
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah, oh, yeah.

01:09:47.359 --> 01:09:49.760
Who's going to make the call?

01:09:49.840 --> 01:09:51.921
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah.

01:09:52.040 --> 01:09:53.689
Oh, yeah.

01:09:55.200 --> 01:09:57.160
- Fuck.
- Don't answer that phone.

01:09:57.240 --> 01:09:58.520
Don't answer it.

01:09:58.600 --> 01:10:00.120
It can wait, don't answer it.

01:10:00.200 --> 01:10:02.851
Fuck, you don't stop now.

01:10:04.520 --> 01:10:06.329
This is business.

01:10:09.160 --> 01:10:10.525
Yeah?

01:10:12.160 --> 01:10:17.120
Thing is, I really wasn't planning
on working this year.

01:10:17.200 --> 01:10:21.205
Right now, I got
a pretty decent piece of pussy...

01:10:21.320 --> 01:10:24.642
with a big 'ol ass
spread right in front of me.

01:10:26.280 --> 01:10:28.089
Double last year's fee.

01:10:29.720 --> 01:10:33.520
Done. I'll be there in 90 minutes.

01:10:33.600 --> 01:10:36.080
Who was that?

01:10:36.160 --> 01:10:37.400
Fuck off.

01:10:37.480 --> 01:10:38.686
Who was it, baby?

01:10:42.240 --> 01:10:44.920
That, believe it or not...

01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:50.480
was Mr. None Of-Your-Fucking-Business.

01:10:50.560 --> 01:10:53.320
Yeah, well, what the fuck
am I supposed to do?

01:10:53.400 --> 01:10:58.080
Well, you can stick your fingers
in your dripping twat...

01:10:58.160 --> 01:11:01.960
and finish yourself off,
or get the fuck out.

01:11:02.440 --> 01:11:04.400
Frankly my dear, I don't give a damn.

01:11:04.480 --> 01:11:06.240
You know, you're pretty full of yourself.

01:11:06.320 --> 01:11:09.840
Nobody messes with Mr. Big Shot.
Well, fuck you.

01:11:09.920 --> 01:11:15.440
Bitch, when you run
a perfect game day after day...

01:11:15.520 --> 01:11:18.800
ain't luck, hon. Skill.

01:11:18.880 --> 01:11:21.000
Can I at least take a shower before I go?

01:11:21.080 --> 01:11:23.440
Negative.

01:11:23.520 --> 01:11:27.127
Take that sticking ass and hit the bricks.

01:11:59.320 --> 01:12:01.561
Do you hear that?

01:12:06.400 --> 01:12:08.323
God, I love that song.

01:12:13.400 --> 01:12:17.405
Shit. I wish I was in California.

01:12:49.800 --> 01:12:51.480
What am I working with?

01:12:51.560 --> 01:12:54.200
Four hours and thirty-seven minutes.

01:12:54.280 --> 01:12:57.523
I can kill your whole family
in that amount of time.

01:14:13.320 --> 01:14:18.160
I'm not crazy, I'm in control.

01:14:18.240 --> 01:14:20.200
I'm not crazy, I'm in control.

01:14:20.280 --> 01:14:25.040
I'm not crazy, I'm in control!

01:14:25.120 --> 01:14:26.963
I'm not. Fuck!

01:14:29.800 --> 01:14:31.290
Fuck!

01:14:32.120 --> 01:14:33.963
Fuck!

01:15:01.120 --> 01:15:03.009
Gentlemen.

01:15:04.320 --> 01:15:07.280
Take the rest of the night off.

01:15:07.360 --> 01:15:09.840
I'll handle it from here.

01:15:11.760 --> 01:15:14.000
Murder school...

01:15:14.080 --> 01:15:16.447
well, it's now in session.

01:15:34.200 --> 01:15:35.440
Hey, bitch.

01:15:35.520 --> 01:15:39.400
Did you really think cutting
my head off was going to keep me down?

01:15:39.480 --> 01:15:44.042
I got that motherfucker sewn back
on pronto, and I am feeling groovy.

01:15:45.880 --> 01:15:49.480
See, we ain't human around here.
No, no, no.

01:15:49.560 --> 01:15:52.000
Ain't you learned shit, yet?

01:15:52.080 --> 01:15:55.840
Hey, brother, looky over here.

01:15:55.920 --> 01:15:58.161
You want to see something mad funny?

01:16:00.880 --> 01:16:02.800
Hey, there number five.

01:16:02.880 --> 01:16:05.360
Welcome to the party.

01:16:05.440 --> 01:16:07.320
Here's your first question.

01:16:07.400 --> 01:16:10.563
What's sicker than fucking
a pregnant bitch?

01:16:12.280 --> 01:16:14.640
Gee, I don't know.

01:16:14.720 --> 01:16:17.644
What is sicker than fucking
a pregnant bitch?

01:16:19.080 --> 01:16:22.562
Getting a blowjob from the baby.

01:16:25.400 --> 01:16:28.240
- Do another one, man.
- All right, all right.

01:16:28.320 --> 01:16:30.200
Next one, number five.

01:16:30.280 --> 01:16:35.730
What is the difference
between an onion and a whore?

01:16:36.800 --> 01:16:39.720
Oh, shucks, I don't know.

01:16:39.800 --> 01:16:44.044
Though I should, 'cause I am a whore.
What is it?

01:16:44.160 --> 01:16:46.240
Wait, wait, wait, I know this one.

01:16:46.320 --> 01:16:47.400
Let me do it, let me do it.

01:16:47.480 --> 01:16:48.845
All right, brother, you go ahead.

01:16:50.480 --> 01:16:55.480
The difference between an onion
and a whore is...

01:16:55.560 --> 01:16:57.767
I cry when I cut onions.

01:16:59.600 --> 01:17:02.760
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay.

01:17:02.840 --> 01:17:05.047
It's okay.

01:17:06.800 --> 01:17:09.121
It's okay.

01:17:16.280 --> 01:17:17.964
It's all right.

01:17:19.480 --> 01:17:21.403
Roscoe.

01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:32.080
I had the worst nightmare.

01:17:32.160 --> 01:17:36.882
How can a nightmare
be any worse than this reality?

01:17:39.680 --> 01:17:41.045
It can't.

01:17:44.800 --> 01:17:47.200
How long was I asleep?

01:17:47.280 --> 01:17:49.600
I don't know.

01:17:49.680 --> 01:17:52.800
At this point I don't know...

01:17:52.880 --> 01:17:55.201
if it's a minute or an hour.

01:17:57.000 --> 01:17:58.400
Where's Charly?

01:17:58.480 --> 01:18:00.480
Hey, did...

01:18:00.560 --> 01:18:01.880
Where's Charly?

01:18:01.960 --> 01:18:04.122
She went down the hall
to see what she could find.

01:18:04.240 --> 01:18:06.640
You let her go out on her own?

01:18:06.720 --> 01:18:08.609
Like I was going to stop her?

01:18:10.400 --> 01:18:12.880
You idiot. An idiot.

01:18:12.960 --> 01:18:16.320
She specifically said
for you to stay here.

01:18:16.400 --> 01:18:19.000
Well, that's not going to happen.

01:18:19.080 --> 01:18:20.764
Come on, Venus.

01:18:20.880 --> 01:18:22.882
Give me a fucking break.

01:18:34.720 --> 01:18:36.404
Excuse me for asking, father...

01:18:36.520 --> 01:18:41.080
but what exactly is the protocol
if we have a survivor?

01:18:41.160 --> 01:18:42.960
Doom-Head has never failed us.

01:18:43.040 --> 01:18:46.000
He will deliver, as expected.

01:18:46.080 --> 01:18:50.051
I mean no disrespect,
but that was not the question.

01:18:56.080 --> 01:18:59.360
I suggest you make sure
your final wagers are in order.

01:18:59.440 --> 01:19:01.320
Lovely. Thank you, darling, thank you.

01:19:01.400 --> 01:19:04.080
Lovely, lovely, lovely.

01:19:04.160 --> 01:19:06.920
Right, my wager.

01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:09.401
Five million.

01:19:11.400 --> 01:19:15.320
I respectfully decline. I am out.

01:19:15.400 --> 01:19:17.040
Of course you are.

01:19:17.120 --> 01:19:20.442
Playing with the big boys
isn't everyone's cup of tea.

01:19:24.320 --> 01:19:26.527
I will take that bet.

01:19:31.600 --> 01:19:33.887
And double it.

01:19:35.480 --> 01:19:37.080
Charly?

01:19:37.160 --> 01:19:39.360
All right, now we have ourselves a game.

01:19:39.440 --> 01:19:42.171
So, let us continue.

01:19:47.440 --> 01:19:49.886
Charly?

01:20:44.120 --> 01:20:45.610
You smell that?

01:20:47.880 --> 01:20:49.960
Odd smell.

01:20:50.040 --> 01:20:54.440
I didn't yank my crusty old dong
out of some whore's asshole...

01:20:54.520 --> 01:20:57.440
for a quickie wham, bam, thank you, ma'am.

01:20:57.520 --> 01:21:00.888
I came to get down and dirty.

01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:03.128
Oh, yeah.

01:21:05.320 --> 01:21:06.685
Please...

01:21:08.720 --> 01:21:10.160
let them live.

01:21:10.240 --> 01:21:11.840
What is it about me that gives you...

01:21:11.920 --> 01:21:14.730
some impression that I would spare them?

01:21:16.440 --> 01:21:17.680
'Cause if that's the case...

01:21:17.760 --> 01:21:21.003
then I really got to work
on my person to person demeanor.

01:21:23.840 --> 01:21:25.840
Unfortunately...

01:21:25.920 --> 01:21:29.960
those other fools and idiots gave you
the most worthless feeling.

01:21:30.040 --> 01:21:32.480
And that feeling is hope.

01:21:32.560 --> 01:21:36.760
The unicorn alive
shitting the magic rainbow...

01:21:36.840 --> 01:21:39.480
it's but an illusion.

01:21:39.560 --> 01:21:43.280
Life is nothing
but the stinking filthy boneyard...

01:21:43.360 --> 01:21:45.727
of dead rotting tramps.

01:22:16.280 --> 01:22:18.044
Did you see Venus?

01:22:19.120 --> 01:22:21.360
What are you talking about, man?
I left her here with you.

01:22:21.440 --> 01:22:23.886
Fuck me.

01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:26.280
Attention, attention.

01:22:26.360 --> 01:22:29.489
Three hours and four minutes.

01:22:30.600 --> 01:22:32.887
How time flies.

01:23:26.920 --> 01:23:31.240
Victorious warriors win first,
then go to war.

01:23:31.320 --> 01:23:33.288
While defeated warriors...

01:23:33.400 --> 01:23:37.480
they go to war first then seek to win.

01:23:37.560 --> 01:23:39.244
Which are you?

01:23:41.680 --> 01:23:43.569
I'm a gentleman of war.

01:23:44.520 --> 01:23:47.240
So I'll give you a moment
of peace and tranquility...

01:23:47.320 --> 01:23:48.845
with your fallen comrade.

01:23:52.360 --> 01:23:54.200
By the way...

01:23:54.280 --> 01:23:58.569
the doors to the outside world
are now officially open.

01:23:59.520 --> 01:24:02.285
Feel free to wander the grounds.

01:24:25.040 --> 01:24:26.724
Come on, let's go.

01:24:34.240 --> 01:24:36.925
It's a fucking dead end.
A goddamn dead end.

01:24:37.520 --> 01:24:38.601
Damn.

01:24:40.800 --> 01:24:41.880
What's this?

01:24:41.960 --> 01:24:43.564
This, this, this.

01:24:43.680 --> 01:24:46.040
This is fucking it. This is fucking it.

01:24:46.120 --> 01:24:48.441
Help me, help me. This is it.

01:24:49.800 --> 01:24:51.086
- Come on.
- It's rising.

01:24:54.160 --> 01:24:56.162
Come on. Help me.

01:25:06.280 --> 01:25:07.560
What do you think?

01:25:07.640 --> 01:25:08.720
It's your best chance.

01:25:08.800 --> 01:25:10.520
You mean our best chance.

01:25:10.600 --> 01:25:13.200
No, I don't. I can't get down there.

01:25:13.280 --> 01:25:15.680
After everything,
this is where you bail on me?

01:25:15.760 --> 01:25:17.920
No, this shit ain't over.

01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:20.400
I can't get down there. I can't.

01:25:20.480 --> 01:25:22.209
You can.

01:25:23.480 --> 01:25:26.927
Fuck, he's coming. Get in there.

01:25:29.160 --> 01:25:30.880
I'll hold him off as long as I can.

01:25:30.960 --> 01:25:32.320
Wait, I'm not leaving.

01:25:32.400 --> 01:25:33.560
Fucking go.

01:25:33.640 --> 01:25:36.680
- I'm not leaving without you.
- Get the fuck down there.

01:25:36.760 --> 01:25:38.400
- Get the fuck in there.
- Get in here with me.

01:25:38.480 --> 01:25:40.600
Stupid bitch, get in there.
Shut the fuck up and get out of here.

01:25:40.680 --> 01:25:42.808
Get the fuck in there.

01:25:49.120 --> 01:25:51.327
At least I get to die in the fresh air.

01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:54.490
Hey, fuck head!

01:25:56.160 --> 01:25:57.764
Get over here!

01:25:59.480 --> 01:26:01.562
Get the fuck over here, fuck head!

01:26:05.160 --> 01:26:07.208
You trying to fight me or fuck me?

01:26:38.800 --> 01:26:40.131
Fuck you.

01:30:07.200 --> 01:30:08.770
Fuck.

01:30:13.360 --> 01:30:15.760
Number five.

01:30:15.840 --> 01:30:17.046
Boo.

01:30:26.600 --> 01:30:30.764
In moments of great
accomplishment such as this...

01:30:32.240 --> 01:30:34.083
I feel the need to celebrate.

01:30:35.760 --> 01:30:37.480
I found that the best of times...

01:30:37.560 --> 01:30:41.121
happens exactly at the point
we lose track of them.

01:30:42.880 --> 01:30:47.329
We must train ourselves to extend
the moment and learn to live.

01:31:02.200 --> 01:31:04.040
Smoke in times of rest...

01:31:04.120 --> 01:31:07.727
is a great companion
to the solitary soldier.

01:31:08.840 --> 01:31:11.002
You know who said that?

01:31:14.280 --> 01:31:17.489
Do you know said that?

01:31:34.680 --> 01:31:37.968
Do you really think I give a fuck?

01:31:43.200 --> 01:31:48.080
It was everyone's favorite
revolutionary Marxist, Che Guevara.

01:31:48.160 --> 01:31:53.007
Except, I think he smoked a pipe.

01:31:53.880 --> 01:31:57.851
I always thought I'd appear
rather pretentious with a pipe.

01:32:00.200 --> 01:32:04.250
Look into the eyes of a true champion.

01:32:07.360 --> 01:32:09.362
Look.

01:32:10.520 --> 01:32:13.285
Look into the eyes of a true champion.

01:32:14.680 --> 01:32:18.401
Look into the eyes of a true champion.

01:32:20.080 --> 01:32:26.725
Look into the eyes of a true champion.

01:32:42.080 --> 01:32:44.082
That's a good girl.

01:32:44.200 --> 01:32:47.249
It's all okay.

01:32:53.400 --> 01:32:55.720
Catch your breath.

01:32:55.800 --> 01:33:00.480
Catch your breath. It's okay.

01:33:00.560 --> 01:33:03.080
It's okay.

01:33:03.160 --> 01:33:05.160
There you go.

01:33:05.240 --> 01:33:07.322
Relax, little girl.

01:33:12.560 --> 01:33:14.200
Well, well, well...

01:33:14.280 --> 01:33:17.568
shall we do this white chapel style, then?

01:33:20.800 --> 01:33:23.371
Bloody red tears, my dear Mary Kelly.

01:33:25.760 --> 01:33:28.843
I have to say I do respect you.

01:33:30.600 --> 01:33:31.886
But...

01:33:33.280 --> 01:33:34.850
it's time to die.

01:33:36.800 --> 01:33:41.681
Weapons down. Weapons down.

01:33:41.800 --> 01:33:44.040
Motherfucker!

01:33:44.120 --> 01:33:48.760
Thirty-one has come to an end.

01:33:48.840 --> 01:33:52.367
You lucky fucking dirty little cunt.

01:34:23.360 --> 01:34:28.440
It seems the unthinkable has happened.

01:34:28.520 --> 01:34:30.440
We have a winner.

01:34:30.520 --> 01:34:34.800
What exactly will you do with her?

01:34:34.880 --> 01:34:38.960
I'm going to have to get back
to you on that one.

01:34:39.040 --> 01:34:44.206
Thank you for another exciting year of 31.
