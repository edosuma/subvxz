<i>Uh, why don't you
come on in, have a seat?</i>

01:23.781 --> 01:27.185
<i>- Okay. Here?
- Perfect, yeah.</i>

01:27.218 --> 01:30.288
<i>I'm just gonna adjust
a couple of things here.</i>

01:30.322 --> 01:32.859
<i>Beautiful. Okay.</i>

01:33.926 --> 01:35.594
<i>Oh, yeah.

01:35.628 --> 01:36.896
<i>- Oh, that's great.
- Okay.</i>

01:36.929 --> 01:40.832
<i>That's great. Alright.</i>

01:40.865 --> 01:44.736

introducing our new boy</i>

01:44.769 --> 01:48.473

sunny San Diego, California.</i>

01:48.507 --> 01:50.910
<i>Welcome, Brent Corrigan.</i>

01:50.942 --> 01:52.578
Hey.

02:33.352 --> 02:35.188
<i>- Yeah. Tell us a little bit
about yourself.</i>

02:35.221 --> 02:36.855
<i>Uh, how... how old are you?</i>

02:36.889 --> 02:39.825
<i>- Eighteen.
- Eighteen?</i>

02:39.858 --> 02:42.694
<i>I had to double check that ID
a couple of times, didn't I?</i>

02:43.729 --> 02:44.764
Yeah.

03:12.824 --> 03:14.893
<i>- You in college?
- Uh, no.</i>

03:14.926 --> 03:18.997
Um, I... I wanna be.

03:19.031 --> 03:21.266
<i>- Yeah?
- Yeah.</i>

03:21.300 --> 03:22.768
<i>And what would you study?</i>

03:22.800 --> 03:25.237
<i>- Film.
- Really?</i>

03:25.270 --> 03:26.605
<i>Huh, interesting.</i>

03:26.639 --> 03:29.641
<i>So you'd like to be
on this side of the lens, huh?</i>

03:29.675 --> 03:31.344
- Yeah.
- Sean!

03:31.377 --> 03:34.413
Hey, you are finally here,
in the flesh.

03:34.445 --> 03:35.681
Yeah.

03:35.713 --> 03:39.852
- You look, uh, you look great.
- Thanks. You look good, too.

03:39.884 --> 03:42.921
- No, no.
I'm, uh, I'm an old man.

03:42.955 --> 03:45.892
- Old men can look good, too.
- Yeah.

03:47.526 --> 03:49.462
Let's go.
- Okay.

03:59.705 --> 04:01.407
You like Chopin?

04:02.373 --> 04:05.411
Uh... I'm not sure.

04:21.060 --> 04:22.495
<i>- Why don't you tell us
about your first time?</i>

04:22.528 --> 04:25.463
<i>Uh, you know,
what was that like?</i>

04:25.497 --> 04:26.732
Um..

04:28.966 --> 04:32.038
I was young, um, 15.

04:32.071 --> 04:35.574
<i>Hm. Who was he?</i>

04:35.607 --> 04:37.977
My friend's older brother.

04:38.009 --> 04:39.678
<i>How old?</i>

04:41.512 --> 04:42.681
Twenty five.

04:55.961 --> 04:58.931
<i>- Alright, the fridge
is stocked, pantry, too.</i>

04:58.963 --> 05:00.466
<i>Take whatever you want,
whenever.</i>

05:00.499 --> 05:04.937
I've got sandwich meat,
string cheese, juices.

05:04.970 --> 05:06.972
- Cool.
- Cheers.

05:08.639 --> 05:09.974
<i>Let's loosen things up
a little bit</i>

05:10.007 --> 05:13.812
<i>and, uh, take off
some of those clothes.</i>

05:13.846 --> 05:15.413
<i>- Okay.
- Alright.</i>

05:15.447 --> 05:17.850
<i>Show the Cobra fans
what they really wanna see.</i>

05:19.050 --> 05:22.387
<i>Hm. There we go.</i>

05:24.822 --> 05:26.658
<i>Nice and slim.</i>

05:26.692 --> 05:28.627
<i>Beautiful.
Look at that body.</i>

05:43.475 --> 05:44.811
Wanna see it?

05:45.778 --> 05:46.778
Yeah.

05:48.079 --> 05:50.048
Show me that cock.

05:54.952 --> 05:58.423
That's it. Oh, yeah.
They're gonna love you.

06:00.024 --> 06:02.127
They are gonna love you.

06:03.595 --> 06:04.597
Oh, yeah.

06:15.993 --> 06:19.693
Subrip by DanDee

06:36.694 --> 06:39.130
You, uh, have everything
you need?

06:39.163 --> 06:41.967
- Yeah. Thanks.
- Great.

06:43.601 --> 06:45.537
Uh, you're gonna
sleep in here tonight?

06:47.004 --> 06:50.475
Um... yeah.

06:50.509 --> 06:51.843
<i>Good. No. Absolutely.</i>

06:51.877 --> 06:56.115
Um, I have, uh, some errands

06:56.148 --> 06:57.216
that I have to run
in the morning

06:57.249 --> 07:00.219
but I will come back
and I will take to you brunch.

07:00.252 --> 07:02.889
Okay?
- Sure. Thanks.

07:04.255 --> 07:05.524
Sleep well.

07:07.593 --> 07:08.628
Hey.

07:10.262 --> 07:12.197
How was I?

07:13.732 --> 07:16.436
<i>- Amazing.
- You can be honest.</i>

07:18.603 --> 07:20.605
- You have something
very, very special.

07:23.709 --> 07:25.644
<i>- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.</i>

07:44.596 --> 07:47.533
Okay.

07:47.565 --> 07:48.500
Hm.

08:07.185 --> 08:08.653
Very nice.

08:11.223 --> 08:12.557
<i>Everybody smile.</i>

08:13.625 --> 08:17.529
Alright. Come on.
How come you're not smiling?

08:17.562 --> 08:18.863
What's the matter?
This isn't fun?

08:18.896 --> 08:21.033
Come on! Come on.
This is fun!

08:21.065 --> 08:22.767
I just need
a couple of more shots, okay?

08:22.800 --> 08:24.068
And then we're gonna get
some ice cream

08:24.101 --> 08:25.570
and then you guys
just keep smiling.

08:25.603 --> 08:27.171
Perfect. That's great.
That's great.

08:27.204 --> 08:28.907
We'll get some ice cream.

08:28.940 --> 08:30.174
Very nice.

08:38.182 --> 08:40.686
<i># I'm looking
for the purest place #</i>

08:40.719 --> 08:44.256
<i># That ever was #</i>

08:47.859 --> 08:53.099
<i># Escaping to the sands
of magic and might #</i>

08:57.936 --> 09:01.139
<i># Ah-ah ah ah-ah ah ah ##</i>

09:01.173 --> 09:04.643
- Here you go.
Just like mom used to make.

09:04.676 --> 09:07.079
- Thank you.
- Oh.

09:09.081 --> 09:12.350
<i>- What's this?
- It's for the pictures.</i>

09:12.384 --> 09:13.351
No, no, no.

09:13.384 --> 09:15.653
- Well, come on, it's your job.
I'm a customer.

09:15.687 --> 09:17.656
<i>I wanna pay.
- Don't be silly.</i>

09:17.688 --> 09:19.024
I insist.

09:19.057 --> 09:20.759
I refuse.

09:36.875 --> 09:40.678
- Okay, only
if you take Kathy out.

09:40.711 --> 09:42.814
- What? No. I told you
that's not gonna happen.

09:42.847 --> 09:45.383
- Oh, come on.
Don't say you're not interested.

09:45.417 --> 09:46.317
You haven't even met her.

09:46.351 --> 09:48.754
- I saw her picture.
I'm not interested.

09:48.787 --> 09:50.254
Um. Oh.

09:50.288 --> 09:52.825
- I can take care
of my own love life very well.

09:52.857 --> 09:56.294
Thank you very, very much,
though. I really appreciate it.

09:56.327 --> 09:57.362
You are so stubborn.

09:57.395 --> 10:00.732
- Well, it seems to run
in the family, doesn't it?

10:00.765 --> 10:03.168
Devastation from Louisiana.

10:03.201 --> 10:06.271
<i>- One by one, survivors of
Hurricane Katrina are being..</i>

10:06.303 --> 10:07.706
<i>- Frankly,
the Bush administration</i>

10:07.739 --> 10:08.940
<i>should be ashamed.</i>

10:08.974 --> 10:11.877
<i>- Horses have helped humans
so much over the years</i>

10:11.909 --> 10:14.312
<i>to reach our full potential.</i>

10:15.681 --> 10:19.218
<i>Back on Fania's farm,
Matinee and Gloria</i>

10:19.250 --> 10:21.419
<i>retired show horses

10:21.452 --> 10:24.023
<i>absolutely inseparable.</i>

10:25.423 --> 10:27.425
<i>It's just beautiful to see</i>

10:27.458 --> 10:30.261
<i>these graceful creatures
roam free.</i>

10:31.929 --> 10:33.298
<i>To Brent Corrigan.</i>

10:37.969 --> 10:40.873
Where'd you come up with
that name anyway? It's great.

10:40.905 --> 10:43.307
- I flipped through
a phone book.

10:46.477 --> 10:48.313
Well, Brent..

10:49.980 --> 10:52.350
...this is just the beginning
for you.

10:52.384 --> 10:54.353
I have a feeling.

10:55.986 --> 10:59.190
- You know, you're not such
a big, bad cobra after all.

11:00.392 --> 11:02.427
What's that supposed to mean?

11:02.461 --> 11:04.296
Online..

11:04.328 --> 11:07.699
...you're King Cobra.

11:11.068 --> 11:13.838
I noticed that, uh, Brent

11:13.871 --> 11:16.708
isn't as sweet and shy as Sean.

11:16.741 --> 11:18.242
Mm-hmm.

11:18.275 --> 11:20.346
- It's fun to play with
who we are, don't you think?

11:21.879 --> 11:23.014
- Yeah.
- Hm.

11:25.383 --> 11:27.820
Speaking of which

11:27.852 --> 11:29.787
any interest in going again?

11:29.821 --> 11:31.757
Maybe do a sex scene
this time?

11:31.789 --> 11:34.125
- Maybe I should get back
to San Diego.

11:34.158 --> 11:38.463
- San Diego? For what?
You live on your mother's couch.

11:38.496 --> 11:41.165
Your retail job pays you
what? Ten bucks an hour?

11:41.198 --> 11:42.366
$7.25.

11:42.399 --> 11:45.737
- Oh. They're taking
advantage of you.

11:45.770 --> 11:48.506
You're wasting your time,
your talent.

11:48.539 --> 11:49.574
You deserve so much more.

11:49.607 --> 11:53.377
You deserve to realize
your full, true potential.

11:53.410 --> 11:56.514
I can pay you $1000
for the next video

11:56.548 --> 12:01.352
if you're willing
to go all the way, that is.

12:07.793 --> 12:10.196
Just a little something
to show my appreciation.

12:16.868 --> 12:18.804
This is awesome! Thank you.

12:21.139 --> 12:23.542
- Promise me
that you will take the day

12:23.575 --> 12:25.076
and think about it, okay?

12:27.144 --> 12:28.980
Okay.

12:29.014 --> 12:30.216
Wonderful.

13:03.447 --> 13:05.016
<i>- Hello?
- Hi, mom.</i>

13:05.049 --> 13:07.519
<i>- Hey, how are you?
- I'm good.</i>

13:07.552 --> 13:09.254
<i>That's cool.</i>

13:10.956 --> 13:14.026
<i>How's your trip going?
What are they teaching you?</i>

13:14.058 --> 13:15.493
<i>- Oh, and... and, uh,
they're teaching me about</i>

13:15.527 --> 13:18.129
<i>uh, uh, like,
lighting and... and sound</i>

13:18.163 --> 13:20.099
<i>and how to work the camera.</i>

13:31.142 --> 13:33.612
I got to actually sit
in the editing room

13:33.644 --> 13:35.279
for, like, ten minutes today.

13:35.312 --> 13:37.883
<i>- Oh, that's so cool.
- Yeah.</i>

13:47.893 --> 13:49.961
<i>- I'll see you next week.
Sunday?</i>

13:49.995 --> 13:52.630
Actually, I found out today

13:52.663 --> 13:56.033
I'm the only intern
they're asking to stay.

13:56.067 --> 13:59.971
<i>- Ooh. Wow, that..
For how long?</i>

14:00.004 --> 14:03.508
<i>- For, you know,
a... a, a few weeks maybe</i>

14:03.541 --> 14:05.510
maybe even
the, the rest of the summer.

14:05.543 --> 14:07.879
<i>- Okay.
- If that's cool with you.</i>

14:07.913 --> 14:11.316
<i># Oh you're so filthy
and I'm gorgeous ##</i>

14:14.152 --> 14:16.622
- Hey.
- Hey.

14:16.654 --> 14:18.956
- What are you doin'?
- Homework.

14:18.990 --> 14:20.625
- That sucks.
- Yeah.

14:20.658 --> 14:23.061
This book
doesn't even make any sense.

14:23.094 --> 14:25.297
Maybe you should
take a break.

14:25.330 --> 14:27.032
What do you mean?

14:27.065 --> 14:29.935
My girlfriend's out of town.
That's what I mean.

14:31.201 --> 14:33.071
I've never done this before.

14:33.104 --> 14:35.908
It's okay. I'll show you how.

14:40.211 --> 14:43.649
<i># 'Cause you're filthy #</i>

15:49.780 --> 15:52.683
Have you heard of this guy,
Brent Corrigan?

15:52.716 --> 15:55.052
His videos are selling
like hotcakes.

15:55.086 --> 15:57.254
How do hotcakes sell?

15:57.288 --> 16:00.692
Fast, very fast

16:00.725 --> 16:03.995
because they're
so warm and delicious.

16:04.028 --> 16:06.230
He's got nothin' on you,
baby.

16:06.264 --> 16:08.133
<i>Just wait till
I make you a star.</i>

16:08.166 --> 16:11.236
- Then I can get my new car?
A Viper, red.

16:13.038 --> 16:15.139
There's my boy.

16:15.173 --> 16:19.144
That's what I like.
Hungry like daddy, huh?

16:19.177 --> 16:22.014
We just gotta save up
a little bit more money.

16:22.047 --> 16:26.451
So you gotta be extra nice
to your clients, alright?

16:26.484 --> 16:28.519
Who's daddy's
little piggy bank?

16:28.552 --> 16:30.022
Hm?
- Joe.

16:30.054 --> 16:32.690

little piggy bank?

16:32.724 --> 16:35.594
Where's my little piggy bank?

16:36.827 --> 16:40.631
Oh! There's the piggy.
There's the piggy.

16:40.664 --> 16:43.668
Where's my piggy?
Where's my piggy?

Work out like a man!

17:08.791 --> 17:09.727
Wow.

17:21.204 --> 17:24.308
Stop. Stop. Stop.

17:24.342 --> 17:27.244
You know how much
I love my tan lines.

17:27.278 --> 17:30.548
- Are you gonna behave tonight?
- Yes.

17:30.582 --> 17:33.218
- No passionate kissing
and no..

17:33.250 --> 17:35.054
- No anal.
- ...anal.

17:39.423 --> 17:40.358
What?

17:46.798 --> 17:48.433
Oh, fuck.

17:51.402 --> 17:53.639
Ah, fuck!

18:00.678 --> 18:03.115
Shaney, come on.

18:03.147 --> 18:05.716
Don't you want these shrimpies?
Come on.

18:06.917 --> 18:09.820
- Hoo!
- Yeah.

18:09.854 --> 18:11.824
<i>Come on, get these shrimpies.
- Oh.</i>

18:13.557 --> 18:15.594
<i>Smell good, huh? Yeah.</i>

18:23.835 --> 18:25.770
<i>I ran a mile for you.</i>

18:28.205 --> 18:30.141
Tell me again about the navy.

18:31.910 --> 18:34.913
So many sweaty, horny men.

18:34.945 --> 18:37.915
<i>- Orgies?
- Hm, I wish.</i>

18:37.949 --> 18:40.352
But the military
is a straight man's world.

18:40.384 --> 18:42.453
That is just the way it is.

18:43.721 --> 18:46.157
- Do you love me
the way you love Joe?

18:46.191 --> 18:48.894
<i>Of course I do, baby.</i>

18:48.926 --> 18:50.728
- I wish I saved you
like he did.

18:50.761 --> 18:52.864
- Hm, you know,
he doesn't like it

18:52.896 --> 18:55.634
when I talk to clients
about our personal life.

18:55.666 --> 18:57.903
<i>I'll get off faster.</i>

18:57.935 --> 18:59.871
- Just tell me again
about the navy.

19:01.905 --> 19:03.407
Alright.

19:03.441 --> 19:06.344
Well, I thought that was who
I was supposed to be

19:06.376 --> 19:08.680
but I was wrong.

19:08.712 --> 19:10.648
And Joe helped me
get honorary discharge

19:10.682 --> 19:11.816
for being a fag.

19:11.848 --> 19:13.784
A... A... A what?

19:17.221 --> 19:18.589
A faggot.

19:24.229 --> 19:25.297
<i>There you go.</i>

19:26.663 --> 19:28.232
That was a huge load.

19:29.834 --> 19:31.635
<i>You've been saving up for me,
huh?</i>

19:31.669 --> 19:32.804
Oh, yeah.

19:34.905 --> 19:35.874
Thank you.

19:39.410 --> 19:40.778
See you next week.

19:46.750 --> 19:48.686
Come on. I'll walk you out.

19:53.023 --> 19:53.958
<i>Thank you.</i>

20:05.269 --> 20:06.270
<i>Hey.</i>

20:20.050 --> 20:21.852
You promised me
you were gonna be good.

20:24.888 --> 20:25.890
I was good.

20:28.960 --> 20:30.996
I saw the way you kissed him

20:31.028 --> 20:32.931
the way he was looking at you.

20:33.964 --> 20:34.899
It's a role, I mean

20:34.932 --> 20:36.934
that was a role
that I was playing for him.

20:36.968 --> 20:38.903
I mean, it's business.

20:38.935 --> 20:41.305
- This... This means
anything to me!

20:41.338 --> 20:43.974
You're more important to me than
any fucking amount of money!

20:44.008 --> 20:46.311
Do you understand that?
- Fuck!

20:46.344 --> 20:49.547
<i>What the fuck?
You wanted me to do this.</i>

20:49.579 --> 20:51.048
You, you got me into this!

20:52.784 --> 20:54.253
Fuck!

20:57.321 --> 20:58.723
I'm sorry.

21:02.059 --> 21:03.727
<i>It's just..</i>

21:06.396 --> 21:08.266
I used to get booked.

21:09.666 --> 21:10.868
- Fuck.
- Now nobody wants me.

21:10.902 --> 21:11.970
They just want you.

21:12.002 --> 21:14.004
<i>- Are you kidding me?
- They just want you.</i>

21:14.038 --> 21:17.342
- They're all fuckin',
dirty old men, okay?

21:17.375 --> 21:18.442
You think I fucking care?

21:18.476 --> 21:20.012
They don't fucking mean
anything to me.

21:21.078 --> 21:22.980
<i>The first time I met you..</i>

21:25.016 --> 21:28.320
...I said I wanted you
to make me jealous.

21:28.353 --> 21:30.489
Well, I guess
I got my fucking wish.

21:33.090 --> 21:36.727
Fuck. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

21:39.596 --> 21:41.532
You're the only one
I've ever loved.

21:43.034 --> 21:45.804
- You know, it's the same thing
for me. Look.

21:45.836 --> 21:47.306
You're the only one ever.

21:50.508 --> 21:52.711
I love you so fucking much.
I go crazy.

21:52.743 --> 21:54.078
I love you, too.

22:14.766 --> 22:16.768
Where's the Kiehl's counter?
I need some products.

22:16.800 --> 22:18.569
I think
you've shopped enough.

22:19.470 --> 22:23.107
Please? Come on.

22:23.141 --> 22:25.810
Don't you want me to stay
looking young?

22:25.843 --> 22:27.479
Okay. Okay. Fine.

22:32.416 --> 22:34.352
<i>How was your mani-pedi?</i>

22:35.185 --> 22:38.455
<i>- I don't know.
I've had better.</i>

22:38.489 --> 22:39.725
<i>Oh.</i>

22:51.169 --> 22:54.072
You still reading
about yourself? Obsess much?

22:54.105 --> 22:58.143
If one more fan dedicates
a blog to me, I will just die.

23:00.778 --> 23:02.146
Oh.

23:05.750 --> 23:10.087
So, um, I think I wanna take
the Vegas gig.

23:10.121 --> 23:10.955
<i>They wanna pay me five grand</i>

23:10.989 --> 23:13.057
<i>just to, like,
sit and sign DVDs.</i>

23:13.089 --> 23:13.923
No. No. No.

23:13.958 --> 23:16.428
They'll just paw at you
and annoy you.

23:16.461 --> 23:18.462
If they wanna see you,
they can just buy the videos.

23:23.166 --> 23:26.670
Please? Pretty please?

23:28.739 --> 23:31.576
- We'll see.
- That's what you said about horseback riding.

23:31.608 --> 23:33.444
I wanna ride a horse.

23:33.478 --> 23:35.145
- I thought you wanted to learn
how to make movies.

23:35.179 --> 23:37.882
<i>- I do.
- Okay. Well..</i>

23:37.914 --> 23:39.517
Here's the record button.
- I know.

23:39.549 --> 23:41.685
- Here's the zoom and the mount, right?
- I know.

23:41.719 --> 23:44.022
- And this is a very...
- I know. I've seen you do it enough.

23:44.055 --> 23:46.490
- Well, you don't know
about auto focus

23:46.523 --> 23:47.958
and... and w... white balance.

23:47.991 --> 23:51.528
All those things.
- Oh, I don't? Let's find out.

23:51.561 --> 23:53.897
<i>And action.
- No.</i>

23:53.931 --> 23:55.933
<i>Now, what are you doing?</i>

23:55.967 --> 23:57.634
No. Stop! Please.

23:57.667 --> 24:01.639
<i>- And here we have King Cobra,
porn producer.</i>

24:03.273 --> 24:05.476
<i>Whose neighbors have no idea
what goes on here</i>

24:05.509 --> 24:06.978
<i>in this
cookie-cutter community.</i>

24:07.010 --> 24:08.480
Stop it.

24:10.013 --> 24:11.482
<i>- Tell me about
your first time.</i>

24:11.516 --> 24:13.651
- No, look.
I'm a behind-the-camera guy.

24:13.683 --> 24:15.753
Alright?
- Please?

24:17.688 --> 24:19.825
<i>- You really wanna know?
- Yeah.</i>

24:24.095 --> 24:27.598
- Alright. I was in college.
I know, late bloomer.

24:29.133 --> 24:31.769
I used to go out
with my buddies every night

24:31.801 --> 24:34.238
my best friends, and they were always
trying to hook me up with girls

24:34.271 --> 24:36.807
and I'd find some way
to mess it up.

24:38.108 --> 24:40.578
I was terrified
to tell them the truth.

24:41.945 --> 24:44.615
Well, we, uh,
we go to this house party

24:44.648 --> 24:46.717
and there's this guy
that I've seen before

24:46.750 --> 24:49.921
even had some classes with and..

24:49.953 --> 24:53.491
I look over
and he's staring right at me.

24:55.125 --> 24:58.829
I'm thinking, no way.
I mean, he's so cute.

25:00.664 --> 25:03.835
So we, uh, we sneak out
of the party.

25:03.867 --> 25:05.202
He takes me back to his place

25:05.236 --> 25:08.940
and we have sex.

25:08.972 --> 25:10.908
Well, that's fucking amazing.

25:12.209 --> 25:13.745
I felt free.

25:16.314 --> 25:18.583
But somebody saw us leaving

25:18.615 --> 25:20.951
and told my friends about it.

25:20.984 --> 25:22.553
They couldn't believe it

25:22.586 --> 25:26.590
so they come over,
barge right in

25:26.624 --> 25:28.960
see us both laying there
in bed together.

25:31.962 --> 25:33.898
They disappeared after that.

25:35.365 --> 25:39.103
So a few years ago

25:39.135 --> 25:42.272
I decided to just do
what I love.

25:42.306 --> 25:46.277
Even if people despise it,
think it's dirty, trashy

25:46.309 --> 25:47.644
I don't give a fuck.

25:48.546 --> 25:52.049
Same goes
for who I'm attracted to.

25:52.083 --> 25:54.252
<i>People think
I'm a dirty old man</i>

25:54.285 --> 25:57.154
<i>for liking boys
who look like you.</i>

25:57.188 --> 25:58.857
Fuck 'em. Hm.

26:02.326 --> 26:04.962
You have no idea
how lucky you are.

26:06.896 --> 26:09.033
Be so confident
at such a young age.

26:10.634 --> 26:13.704
You have the Internet,
so you never have to feel alone.

26:16.272 --> 26:18.108
I just feel like I'm making up
for lost time.

26:18.142 --> 26:20.244
It's fucking depressing.

26:20.277 --> 26:21.580
Hey.

26:34.924 --> 26:36.226
Seanny...

26:37.394 --> 26:39.230
...please just
make me feel wanted.

28:01.746 --> 28:03.815
<i>Excuse me.</i>

28:03.847 --> 28:05.450
- Yeah?
- I'm your neighbor. We haven't really met yet.

28:05.482 --> 28:07.350
I live next door.
- Mm-hmm.

28:07.384 --> 28:08.318
Well..

28:10.421 --> 28:14.325
How old are you?
- Eighteen. Why?

28:14.357 --> 28:17.327
- Well, um, I've just seen
a lot of young boys

28:17.361 --> 28:18.462
coming and going from the house.

28:18.496 --> 28:21.132
I didn't know if they're
your friends or his friends or..

28:23.933 --> 28:25.703
He makes gay porn.

28:36.180 --> 28:40.485
- Ah! Pretty princess finally
decided to show up for work.

28:40.518 --> 28:41.486
Let's go!

28:43.086 --> 28:46.223
- So sorry.
I didn't realize you were here.

28:46.257 --> 28:48.025
Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

28:48.057 --> 28:50.228
- Brent.
- Mikey.

28:50.260 --> 28:53.498
- Sean, what are you wearing?
Those are too flashy.

28:53.530 --> 28:55.466
- You don't know
what Brent likes.

28:56.800 --> 28:58.802
- I think it looks cool.
- Thanks.

29:00.538 --> 29:02.205
<i>- You have the tape recording,
right?</i>

29:02.239 --> 29:03.406
<i>- Yes.
- Good.</i>

29:03.440 --> 29:05.375
I need to emote
what I'm thinking.

29:07.510 --> 29:08.812
Okay.

29:12.215 --> 29:13.984
Action.

29:14.018 --> 29:16.254
<i>- Eighteen years old,
I'm stuck in the suburbs</i>

29:16.287 --> 29:19.423
<i>cleaning this pool all day
for my cousin.</i>

29:19.455 --> 29:22.459
<i>I guess I should be grateful
for this job.</i>

29:22.492 --> 29:25.996
<i>Pool boy. Sure is nice out.</i>

29:26.029 --> 29:28.865
<i>I'm sure he wouldn't mind
if I took a dip.</i>

29:28.898 --> 29:32.569
- Hey, what are you doing?
What are you doing?

29:32.603 --> 29:35.273
- The water looked nice.
I wanted to get wet.

29:37.441 --> 29:39.376
- You have to finish
your chores first.

29:40.176 --> 29:41.311
Come here.

29:43.047 --> 29:45.182
You just bought yourself
another chore, boy.

29:50.554 --> 29:51.855
Mm..

30:02.866 --> 30:03.934
<i>Okay, cut!</i>

30:06.202 --> 30:08.105
<i>I said cut!</i>

30:08.137 --> 30:10.541
Come on. We're on a schedule.
We gotta move inside.

30:13.376 --> 30:14.444
Sorry.

30:22.653 --> 30:23.855
<i>No.</i>

30:31.261 --> 30:33.396
- Alright. Would you please
turn it down?

30:33.430 --> 30:35.099
I'm tryin' to work.

30:35.132 --> 30:37.602
- What?
- Turn it down!

30:37.634 --> 30:39.570
- If it's too loud,
you're too old.

30:47.478 --> 30:49.113
Don't you have to go home?

30:49.613 --> 30:50.981
No.

31:39.262 --> 31:41.598
So what's your deal?

31:41.632 --> 31:43.567
You, like, live here
or something?

31:45.035 --> 31:48.573
Yeah. I mean, temporarily.

31:50.606 --> 31:53.476
- Why don't you
get your own place?

31:53.509 --> 31:57.147
- I don't make that much money.
- You're a porn star.

31:57.181 --> 31:59.150
What are you doing
with this fucking guy?

32:01.018 --> 32:03.954
I don't know. I mean...

32:03.988 --> 32:05.089
He takes care of me

32:05.122 --> 32:08.526
and... he makes my videos.

32:10.493 --> 32:12.963
I'll take care of you.

32:12.997 --> 32:15.199
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

32:15.231 --> 32:17.268
And I'm gonna kidnap you tonight.
- No, you're not.

32:17.300 --> 32:18.668
- Yeah, I am.
- No, I can't.

32:18.701 --> 32:22.140
- I'm gonna kidnap you.
- No, you're not. Just don't.

32:50.166 --> 32:52.369
<i>- Nice ride.
You must be Jagger.</i>

32:52.403 --> 32:56.039
- Yeah. Theo told me
to hurry up.

32:56.073 --> 32:58.009
Good thing this Viper's fast.

32:59.675 --> 33:00.711
Hop in.

33:04.213 --> 33:07.184
Now get down on your knees
and suck my big cock.

33:10.386 --> 33:12.288
- What the fuck
are you guys doing?

33:12.321 --> 33:15.025
- Take off your clothes
or I'll cut you, too.

33:32.608 --> 33:34.778
What are you guys doing?

33:34.811 --> 33:38.081
I wanna play.
- Expanding the site.

33:38.816 --> 33:42.819
- Blowin' up, baby.
- Cool.

33:42.853 --> 33:45.389
Guess whose videos
are by far the most viewed?

33:47.825 --> 33:49.794
<i>Who's daddy's little star?</i>

33:49.826 --> 33:52.762
Sorry, I mean, big fucking star.

33:52.796 --> 33:54.832
- I'm not as big of a star
as Brent.

33:54.865 --> 33:57.801
<i>- Who?
- Brent Corrigan.</i>

33:57.835 --> 34:00.038
What, have you been
living under a porn rock?

34:00.703 --> 34:02.405
<i>Harlow</i>

34:02.439 --> 34:05.109
<i>you'll be so much bigger
than that fucking twink.</i>

34:05.142 --> 34:07.278
You wanna know a thing
about twinks?

34:07.310 --> 34:10.514
With a twink, you blink,
and they're a fucking twunk.

34:10.547 --> 34:14.351
Okay? Washed up.
You? You're a fucking man.

34:14.384 --> 34:16.719
<i>You got everything, baby.
Fucking twink.</i>

34:16.753 --> 34:19.556
- Yeah, fuck that twink.
- Fuck that twink.

34:20.858 --> 34:22.493
Fuck that twink.

34:39.610 --> 34:42.179
Are you fucking
the new assistant?

34:42.210 --> 34:44.748
What? Oh, God, no.

34:47.317 --> 34:50.454
Alright. Just checking.

34:54.724 --> 34:58.795
- Baby, it is so hot
that you'd rather kill me

34:58.829 --> 35:00.798
than let someone else have me.

35:04.867 --> 35:07.304
- Will you prove to me
how much you like it?

35:17.246 --> 35:19.349
Yeah. Fuck, yeah.
- Yeah.

35:19.382 --> 35:20.917
Oh, you like that?
- Fuck, yeah.

35:20.951 --> 35:23.920
Fuck that ass!
Fuck that asshole!

35:23.954 --> 35:27.525
- You like that big dick?
- Fuck, yeah. Fuck yes!

35:27.557 --> 35:29.159
<i>You fucking like that?</i>

35:29.193 --> 35:31.395
<i>Give me that dick!</i>

35:36.199 --> 35:38.335
Big dick's mine! Fuck!

35:46.909 --> 35:48.846
<i>Did a little shopping today.</i>

35:50.447 --> 35:52.750
Ain't she a beauty?
- Uh..

35:54.384 --> 35:56.786
You already have
a silver convertible.

35:56.820 --> 35:58.823
This is a Maserati.

36:04.994 --> 36:07.697
Oh, yes! Love it!

36:19.675 --> 36:21.945
Hm. Hm.

36:28.851 --> 36:29.853
We need to talk.

36:30.920 --> 36:32.455
About what?

36:33.489 --> 36:34.658
How much I make.

36:36.760 --> 36:37.995
- That sounds fair.
- Hm.

36:38.027 --> 36:40.430
- You've been working
very, very hard.

36:40.463 --> 36:42.900
Why don't we bump you up
to $1500 for the next video?

36:42.932 --> 36:43.934
Ten thousand.

36:45.802 --> 36:46.836
Pardon me?

36:48.005 --> 36:49.539
Ten thousand.

36:52.342 --> 36:53.744
Where is this coming from?

36:53.777 --> 36:54.979
You make a lot of money
off these videos

36:55.012 --> 36:56.313
and it's 'cause of me.

36:56.346 --> 36:59.250
Oh. It's because of us.

36:59.282 --> 37:01.918
I produce, direct, cast, edit.

37:01.952 --> 37:03.754
There's a lot of overhead
that goes into this business.

37:03.786 --> 37:06.790
There's distribution, there's,
there's taking care of you.

37:15.632 --> 37:18.335
Two thousand for the next video,
and that's absolutely final.

37:18.367 --> 37:20.503
<i>- I don't think that's fair.
- You don't know what I make.</i>

37:20.536 --> 37:21.938
- You just bought
a fucking Maserati, Stephen.

37:21.972 --> 37:23.908
Do you think I'm an idiot?

37:25.007 --> 37:28.445
Oh. I see what this is.

37:30.313 --> 37:32.915
You think I only spoil myself.

37:32.949 --> 37:36.954
Well... get ready
to feel like a real idiot

37:36.987 --> 37:38.923
for bringing this up today.

37:41.458 --> 37:42.960
Happy birthday.

37:51.001 --> 37:52.003
Hm.

37:56.505 --> 37:59.342
- Twenty five hundred
for the next video

37:59.376 --> 38:01.478
and I suggest you take it

38:01.510 --> 38:04.380
because according
to the contract that you signed

38:04.414 --> 38:07.785
I don't have to give you a raise
until we make five more videos.

38:08.784 --> 38:11.321
<i>Read before you sign, darling.</i>

38:14.123 --> 38:15.326
<i>You know what?</i>

38:16.726 --> 38:18.929
I'm only gonna give it to you
under one condition.

38:21.097 --> 38:22.532
What condition?

38:27.371 --> 38:29.405
You have to tell me

38:29.438 --> 38:32.509
that I fucked you better
than your little boy-toy, Mikey.

38:32.541 --> 38:35.112
<i>- Oh, Jesus.
- Say it.</i>

38:35.144 --> 38:39.050
Say I fucked you better
than he did.

38:52.027 --> 38:55.865
- You fucked me
better than he did.

38:57.467 --> 38:58.402
Happy?

39:01.737 --> 39:02.772
Thank you.

39:20.590 --> 39:23.394
There's a good boy.

39:23.427 --> 39:25.363
Keep things nice and clean.

39:26.963 --> 39:28.699
I have to go out
and run some errands.

39:28.731 --> 39:31.668
Do not go outside, okay?

39:31.701 --> 39:33.670
The neighbors gossip enough.

40:44.673 --> 40:45.842
- Leave the money
on the dresser

40:45.876 --> 40:47.144
and come get comfortable.

40:50.813 --> 40:52.182
That's a good start.

41:08.164 --> 41:10.033
- Cut. Cut.
- What..

41:10.065 --> 41:12.168
- I'm sorry.
Can we, can we just cut?

41:12.202 --> 41:13.737
- Okay, cut.
- Is everything okay?

41:13.769 --> 41:15.873
- Yeah, I just need a second.
- Harlow?

41:19.708 --> 41:22.144
Just take five.
- Yeah.

41:35.891 --> 41:37.260
- What's this?
Where are you going?

41:38.228 --> 41:40.063
Home.

41:40.096 --> 41:42.699
- Hey, what's wrong, baby?
- Nothing.

41:42.731 --> 41:44.634
- No, don't do that. Tell me.
- Nothing.

41:44.668 --> 41:47.738
- Tell me. What's wrong?
Just tell me.

41:47.771 --> 41:51.675
What's wrong? What's wrong?
Huh? What's wrong?

41:51.708 --> 41:54.077
It... It's just that he...

41:55.311 --> 41:57.280
...he reminded me of him.

41:57.313 --> 41:58.248
Oh.

42:00.016 --> 42:01.552
- The way
he look... looked at me

42:01.585 --> 42:05.188
the way, the way he touched me
when I was younger. I..

42:10.693 --> 42:12.195
- You know,
you have to come back, right?

42:12.228 --> 42:14.231
You signed a contract.
- Fuck your contract.

42:14.264 --> 42:16.333
Excuse me?

42:16.365 --> 42:17.867
- I'm not
your fucking property.

42:17.900 --> 42:18.801
- Alright, fine!
Get out of here.

42:18.835 --> 42:20.736
Go back to your mother
and your shit job.

42:20.769 --> 42:21.905
You'll come crawling back!

42:21.938 --> 42:23.340
- You think
I can't get my own work?

42:23.373 --> 42:27.644
I have a name.
- No! You are Sean Nobody.

42:27.677 --> 42:30.079
I created Brent. I'm the one
who made the investments.

42:30.112 --> 42:31.847
I'm not losing you to anybody.
- Fuck you!

42:31.880 --> 42:33.317
You walk out that door

42:33.349 --> 42:35.318
I'll tell your mother
exactly what you've been doing.

42:35.351 --> 42:37.320
I'll tell her
that you're a whore!

42:40.222 --> 42:44.594
Sean. Sean. Please,
listen, please. I'm sorry!

42:44.628 --> 42:45.729
It's fine.

42:46.795 --> 42:48.864
Listen to me.

42:48.898 --> 42:52.635
Your stepdad
is never gonna hurt you again.

42:53.369 --> 42:55.972
I'm here now, okay?

42:56.773 --> 42:58.307
No one

42:58.340 --> 43:01.344
no one is ever gonna
do that to you again.

43:02.679 --> 43:03.847
Okay?

43:06.682 --> 43:10.286
Just you and me.
Just you and me.

43:12.422 --> 43:13.356
Fuck.

43:38.414 --> 43:40.317
<i>My Viper.
- Do it.</i>

43:40.349 --> 43:41.317
<i>Hey.
- What the fuck are you doing?</i>

43:41.351 --> 43:43.353
<i>- Let it go.
- This is my fucking car!</i>

43:45.288 --> 43:47.289
Hey, hey, hey.

43:47.322 --> 43:49.259
- What?
- Hold it back. Hold it back!

43:49.291 --> 43:51.694
<i>- Look, next is pepper spray
and after that is the police.</i>

43:51.728 --> 43:53.296
<i>- You're gonna pepper spray me?
- Don't make me.</i>

43:53.329 --> 43:55.731
- In my own fucking driveway?
- Just doin' our job, man.

43:55.764 --> 43:57.733
Just doin' our job.
You gotta let it go.

43:57.766 --> 43:59.869
It's hooked up, alright?

43:59.902 --> 44:01.771
Thank you. Yeah.
- Let's get the fuck out of here.

44:01.804 --> 44:03.406
Check again.
If not, we're pulling.

44:05.442 --> 44:08.045
Goddamn it. Fuck!

44:08.077 --> 44:09.246
- I don't understand
what even happened.

44:09.278 --> 44:12.382
Are they really gonna take
my car? It's my fucking baby.

44:12.414 --> 44:15.719
Look, we're just, just a little
behind on the bills, that's all.

44:15.751 --> 44:17.320
- Whoa, wait, what do you mean
we're behind on the bills?

44:17.353 --> 44:18.454
We make a lot of money, Joe.
What are you talking...

44:18.487 --> 44:20.923
- I don't, I don't wanna change
our lifestyle, alright?

44:20.956 --> 44:23.960
I want you to be happy.
- I don't care about our fucking lifestyle.

44:23.992 --> 44:26.328
If we can't pay the fucking bills, I won't be happy.
- We're gonna be fine.

44:26.362 --> 44:28.999
We're fine. We're gonna
be fine. We'll be fine.

44:29.032 --> 44:31.735
- How much do we owe?
How much do we owe?

44:33.202 --> 44:35.304
Joe, how much do we owe?
- Half a million!

44:38.440 --> 44:39.876
Oh, my God.

44:41.844 --> 44:43.879
Fuck them!

44:43.913 --> 44:46.449
They're not gonna take
your baby. Fuck them!

44:46.483 --> 44:49.486
- No. Joe. Joe, wait.
- Fuck them!

44:49.518 --> 44:52.054
- Fuck them!
- No, Joe. Stop!

44:52.088 --> 44:53.457
No, Joe! No! Do not...

44:53.489 --> 44:55.024
- I'm not giving up
our lifestyle

44:55.057 --> 44:56.492
- No!
- I'm gonna fucking kill them.

44:56.525 --> 44:58.928
- Who, who are you gonna...
- I don't fucking know!

45:00.295 --> 45:02.732
God!

45:02.766 --> 45:04.901
Get out of my way.
Get out of the way. Move.

45:04.934 --> 45:08.305
<i>- Joe, stop!
- Move! Move! Move! Move!</i>

45:19.282 --> 45:22.818
Joe. Joe.

45:22.851 --> 45:25.422
Joe, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, Joe.

45:25.454 --> 45:28.958
Please don't, please don't cry.
Don't be upset.

45:28.992 --> 45:32.394
Come on, Joe, please. I'm sorry.
We're gonna get through this.

45:59.454 --> 46:01.357
- Mom, I told you
I would get the heavy ones.

46:01.391 --> 46:03.492
- Do not treat me
like an old woman.

46:03.525 --> 46:05.394
You are an old woman.

46:05.427 --> 46:06.797
- What?
- Yup.

46:06.829 --> 46:09.032
- I don't see it,
Mr. Muscle man here.

46:09.065 --> 46:11.300
What's this, scrawny arms?

46:11.333 --> 46:12.469
- Okay.
- You ever heard of a gym?

46:12.501 --> 46:16.239
- Mom!
- What? You started it.

46:16.271 --> 46:19.476
<i>- I'm so glad you're back.
- Me, too.</i>

46:19.509 --> 46:22.144
Mm, look at this place, huh?

46:22.177 --> 46:24.815
My first apartment
was a shit hole.

46:24.847 --> 46:26.248
It's not that nice.

46:26.282 --> 46:30.353
- It's got charm, though,
and it's not my couch

46:30.385 --> 46:32.922
though that will always be
available to you.

46:32.956 --> 46:35.858
Thanks, but no thanks.

46:35.891 --> 46:38.060
<i>I am so proud of you.</i>

46:38.094 --> 46:41.898
Eighteen
and already on your own

46:41.931 --> 46:44.434
but you got rent to pay,
so get a job.

46:44.467 --> 46:46.936
- I told you.
I know producers here.

46:46.969 --> 46:48.938
I can get a PA job
in, like, a second.

46:48.972 --> 46:51.508
<i>- What's a PA job?
- It's like an assistant.</i>

46:51.541 --> 46:53.610
- It doesn't sound
very promising.

46:53.643 --> 46:56.246
- I'll be fine. I promise.
- Okay.

46:56.278 --> 46:58.380
- You look pretty today. Yeah.
- Thank you.

47:04.086 --> 47:05.989
- Ah, Mr. Corrigan.
- Hi.

47:06.021 --> 47:08.858
- Ah, good to see you.
Good to see you.

47:08.891 --> 47:10.527
- Hey, you as well.
- Go ahead. Go get fluffed.

47:10.559 --> 47:14.130
Have a seat. Awesome.
I'm a real, big fan of yours.

47:14.163 --> 47:16.398
- Thank you.
I'm a fan of your work as well.

47:16.431 --> 47:19.869
- So you want to play
with the big boys now, eh?

47:19.902 --> 47:21.136
<i>- Yeah.
- Yeah?</i>

47:21.170 --> 47:23.106
<i>Well, we want to start playing
with you.</i>

47:23.139 --> 47:25.976
Uh, in fact, we can start
as, as early as next week

47:26.009 --> 47:29.646
but, uh... Cobra...

47:29.679 --> 47:31.548
- Yeah, I don't work for them
anymore.

47:31.581 --> 47:33.516
<i>- Really?
- Mm-hmm.</i>

47:33.548 --> 47:36.018
- Huh, 'cause that Stephen guy
seemed to think

47:36.052 --> 47:39.890
that he still had you under
contract as Brent Corrigan.

47:39.922 --> 47:41.523
- Oh, well then, I mean,
that works out great

47:41.556 --> 47:44.226
'cause legally my name
isn't Brent.

47:44.260 --> 47:46.663
- Actually, no, that's
a problem, because the performer

47:46.695 --> 47:49.900
that we wanna work with
is Brent Corrigan

47:49.932 --> 47:50.934
and not a newcomer.

47:50.967 --> 47:53.469
<i>I mean, hey, if you want
to change your name</i>

47:53.503 --> 47:56.439
and then and start all over
again, that's fine as a newcomer

47:56.472 --> 47:58.541
but you know,
I have a lot of newcomers

47:58.574 --> 48:02.144
but the deal
that we wanted with you

48:02.177 --> 48:04.114
is only available to Brent.

48:05.648 --> 48:08.218
I'm sorry, man,
but keep in touch.

48:09.217 --> 48:12.221
<i>Very nice. Oh, that's good.</i>

48:12.255 --> 48:13.657
That is good. Don't be shy.

48:13.690 --> 48:15.525
Take those shorts off.
Let's get comfortable.

48:18.594 --> 48:22.132
<i>Okay, now put your hand
behind your head.</i>

48:22.164 --> 48:24.000
Yeah, that's good.

48:25.068 --> 48:27.571
You are gonna be a big star.
I have a feeling.

48:31.407 --> 48:32.910
Pardon me.

48:33.608 --> 48:34.543
Oh.

48:35.978 --> 48:37.413
<i>Brent!</i>

48:37.447 --> 48:40.317
So nice to hear from you.
- What the fuck is going on?

48:40.349 --> 48:42.985
You can't stop me
from using my name.

48:43.018 --> 48:45.387
- I already have
because it's my name.

48:45.420 --> 48:47.690
I trademarked it.
- What?

48:47.724 --> 48:49.960
<i>- Throw that name around
all you want.</i>

48:49.992 --> 48:52.061
<i>My lawyers will shut you down
every time.</i>

48:52.094 --> 48:54.463
Brent Corrigan
is synonymous with Cobra.

48:54.496 --> 48:55.965
You leaving fucked me!

48:55.998 --> 48:57.067
<i>Yeah, but if I stayed</i>

48:57.099 --> 48:58.268
<i>I would have been
fucking myself.</i>

48:58.300 --> 49:00.670
Oh, Brent Fucks Himself.

49:00.702 --> 49:03.407
Good title for a video.
Shall we collaborate?

49:05.541 --> 49:08.644
- I was 17 when we met.
- What?

49:08.677 --> 49:11.981
- I was underage
for those first Cobra videos.

49:13.349 --> 49:15.652
- That's bullshit.
I... I have a copy of your ID.

49:15.684 --> 49:18.087
<i>- Yeah, well, check it again.
It's fake.</i>

49:18.121 --> 49:20.523
If you, if you don't give me
my name back

49:20.556 --> 49:23.726
I'll tell everybody
you made kiddie porn.

49:23.760 --> 49:27.530
- Wait. Listen. We both know
that you would never do that.

49:27.563 --> 49:30.400
The news would ruin you
just as much as it would me.

49:30.432 --> 49:32.735
<i>- Yeah, it might ruin
my career</i>

49:32.768 --> 49:35.270
<i>but it'll ruin your life.</i>

49:35.304 --> 49:39.075
I'd rather watch you go down
than ever make porn again.

49:39.108 --> 49:41.244
<i>- Sean, you're the one
who lied.</i>

49:41.277 --> 49:43.347
So give it your best shot,
you little shit.

49:59.327 --> 50:01.096
<i>Listen, you don't understand.</i>

50:01.130 --> 50:03.298
They're, they're,
they're taking all of my stuff.

50:03.331 --> 50:04.800
They're taking my computer.

50:04.833 --> 50:06.201
You know,
these are my personal things.

50:06.235 --> 50:08.137
This is private, private stuff.

50:08.170 --> 50:09.571
- Sir, I need you
to step outside.

50:09.605 --> 50:12.509
- I'm in the middle of..
Okay, fine. Fine.

50:12.541 --> 50:13.710
I'll call you back.

50:21.818 --> 50:25.055
- Like, just, like,
please don't tell my mom.

50:34.530 --> 50:36.533
<i># Handle with care.. #</i>

50:39.101 --> 50:40.135
Fuck.

50:40.168 --> 50:41.538
<i>Mr. Corrigan.</i>

50:41.570 --> 50:43.773
I was so looking forward
to work with you.

50:43.806 --> 50:47.110
I spoke to my investor
and it's not gonna happen.

50:47.143 --> 50:49.345
- Why? I mean,
I'm... I'm 18 now.

50:49.378 --> 50:52.715
- Oh, you kind of made
the industry look a little bad

50:52.748 --> 50:54.751
with the whole underage thing.

50:54.784 --> 50:57.420
People are pissed at you,
you know? I'm not.

50:57.452 --> 51:00.155
I think what you did
was fucking hot

51:00.188 --> 51:02.125
but it's a no-go.

51:20.208 --> 51:21.510
<i>Stephen.</i>

51:27.315 --> 51:28.451
Pedophile.

51:29.719 --> 51:32.422
- What?
- Pedophile.

51:39.829 --> 51:41.264
Traci Lords.

51:41.297 --> 51:43.432
She bounced back
after her underage scandal.

51:43.465 --> 51:46.536
Alright? Just give it time.
Give it time.

51:46.568 --> 51:47.471
Lorenzo!

51:53.809 --> 51:56.813
- So what's gonna happen?
Are you gonna go to jail?

51:56.846 --> 51:58.148
<i>- No.
- No?</i>

51:58.181 --> 51:59.282
<i>No. I'm not going to jail.</i>

51:59.315 --> 52:01.416
No, I have proof
that he lied, okay?

52:01.449 --> 52:03.652
He's, he's the little shit
who should be going to jail.

52:03.686 --> 52:05.155
He's a kid.

52:06.688 --> 52:08.924
Ah! I can't believe it!

52:08.958 --> 52:10.693
- Can you at least appreciate
that I'm telling you myself?

52:10.726 --> 52:12.795
- I would have found out anyway.
- How?

52:12.827 --> 52:14.864
<i>Do you watch gay porn?
- Sean!</i>

52:14.896 --> 52:16.900
Oh, my God, I can't believe

52:16.932 --> 52:20.335
I fell for this
paid internship bullshit.

52:20.369 --> 52:22.505
Who the hell gets paid
to be an intern?

52:22.538 --> 52:23.472
I'm sorry.

52:23.505 --> 52:26.475
What about that
parental release I signed?

52:27.443 --> 52:29.846
I... I faked it.

52:29.878 --> 52:33.782
- Oh, my God. The lies.
- I'm sorry.

52:33.815 --> 52:36.952
- I just, I don't understand.
You're, you're so talented.

52:36.985 --> 52:38.954
<i>What happened to you?</i>

52:38.987 --> 52:42.759
And how did you get involved
with pornography?

52:42.791 --> 52:44.326
- There's no way
that you could understand.

52:44.360 --> 52:46.329
You live in this
safe, little bubble

52:46.362 --> 52:47.463
with your little family...

52:47.496 --> 52:49.432
You're family. You're family.

52:49.465 --> 52:51.467
<i>Everybody has stuff, okay?</i>

52:51.500 --> 52:54.903
Everybody. So don't judge me,
alright? I don't judge you.

52:54.936 --> 52:56.705
Please, don't judge me.

52:56.739 --> 52:58.507
<i>Sorry, okay? I'm sorry.</i>

52:58.541 --> 53:00.210
<i>I'll say it a million more
times. I'm sorry.</i>

53:00.242 --> 53:02.244
That won't do anything.

53:02.277 --> 53:05.280
Oh, my God,
you were doing porn!

53:05.313 --> 53:06.949
I thought
you were learning a trade

53:06.983 --> 53:11.188
a dream of yours, and instead,
you were just being a whore.

53:11.987 --> 53:13.155
<i>What is wrong with you, baby?</i>

53:13.188 --> 53:16.725
Since when did I raise somebody
to disrespect their body?

53:16.759 --> 53:17.961
<i>It's not like that.</i>

53:17.994 --> 53:20.262
It... It was just a way
to get out of here.

53:20.295 --> 53:22.798
There are other ways out.

53:22.831 --> 53:24.768
You could have taken
another route.

53:27.269 --> 53:29.905
- Maybe, maybe
this is what I wanted.

53:30.940 --> 53:31.942
Why?

53:33.742 --> 53:35.612
Maybe I like it.

53:38.347 --> 53:41.684
Oh, shit. I'm sorry.

53:41.717 --> 53:44.519
Mom, mommy, I'm sorry.

53:44.552 --> 53:48.324
- Don't pull that
Goody Two-Shoes bullshit on me.

53:48.356 --> 53:50.293
I'm not a fucking idiot.

55:16.945 --> 55:20.750
<i>Joe, this is Sean Lockhart.</i>

55:20.782 --> 55:23.552
<i>I got your e-mail.</i>

55:23.585 --> 55:24.620
<i>Let's meet.</i>

55:26.155 --> 55:28.691
<i>Sushi Ota?
It's on Mission Drive.</i>

55:28.724 --> 55:31.027
<i>I can meet you there
tomorrow night at 8:00.</i>

55:49.110 --> 55:53.648
- Joe, after we make
all this money from Brent

55:53.681 --> 55:55.550
do you think
I could get my Viper back?

55:55.583 --> 55:57.719
- Fuck, yes.
- Yes.

55:57.753 --> 55:59.756
- I'm gonna get you
that Viper back.

55:59.789 --> 56:01.958
I'm gonna get you another Viper
on top of that.

56:04.193 --> 56:05.729
Fuck, yeah.

56:11.900 --> 56:13.969
<i>- Hey. There he is.
- Hm.</i>

56:14.003 --> 56:15.037
- Hi.
- Hey.

56:15.070 --> 56:17.974
- It's nice to meet you.
- You, too.

56:18.007 --> 56:20.108
- Hey. You look great.
- Thanks.

56:20.141 --> 56:22.544
You look really nice, too.
- Very good to meet you, Sean.

56:22.577 --> 56:25.648
Alright. Finally. Have a seat.

56:32.454 --> 56:33.588
So you like this place?

56:33.621 --> 56:34.757
- Yeah, it's really nice.
- Yeah.

56:34.789 --> 56:36.925
- Yeah, this place
is really cool, right?

56:36.958 --> 56:38.927
- Yeah, I really like it.
- Cool.

56:38.960 --> 56:42.431
- Have you seen
any of our Viper-Boyz videos?

56:42.465 --> 56:44.000
Uh, yeah. No, they're cool.

56:44.032 --> 56:45.233
- Can I get you some early drink?
- Yeah.

56:45.268 --> 56:48.670
- Um, yes, will you have the
most expensive bottle of Sake?

56:48.704 --> 56:49.672
I have a great bottle of...

56:49.704 --> 56:52.541
- Get me just
the most expensive bottle, okay?

56:52.574 --> 56:54.777
The most expensive. Thank you.

56:54.809 --> 56:57.078
- Have, have you, uh, have you
seen all of our product..

56:57.112 --> 56:59.014
- He produced all of them. It was me.
- Yeah.

56:59.047 --> 57:00.682
- Alright, listen.
- Yeah. No, it's...

57:00.715 --> 57:02.717
- We can,
we can chitchat all night

57:02.751 --> 57:06.189
but I just want to get down
to the point, alright?

57:06.222 --> 57:09.459
I'm willing to give you $25,000

57:09.492 --> 57:11.594
for one video.

57:11.626 --> 57:14.096
Now, I know
that sounds like a lot

57:14.128 --> 57:16.231
but you gotta spend money
to make money.

57:16.264 --> 57:20.101
And I believe
a video with Harlow and Brent

57:20.135 --> 57:21.938
is gonna make
a shitload of money.

57:21.971 --> 57:23.106
- Yeah, it will make
so much money.

57:23.139 --> 57:26.142
And people really want to,
they'll want to see us fuck.

57:26.175 --> 57:27.043
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

57:28.978 --> 57:33.182
- Harlow.
Man, that's a great porn name.

57:35.284 --> 57:39.088
Thank you. It's my real name.

57:39.121 --> 57:40.990
- Really?
- Yeah.

57:41.023 --> 57:44.126
I mean, I've, I've escorted
under so many different names

57:44.159 --> 57:47.829
um, that I just lost count.

57:47.862 --> 57:50.565
I feel like with porn,
I just wanna be myself.

57:50.599 --> 57:52.134
You know?
- Yeah.

57:52.166 --> 57:54.202
Finding myself in it.

57:54.235 --> 57:56.771
- You're not afraid
of your family finding out?

57:57.940 --> 58:01.143
- Yeah. No, Joe is my family.
- Yeah.

58:01.175 --> 58:03.246
- I mean, I don't know, I would
be a little bit bummed out

58:03.278 --> 58:04.914
if your parents found out.

58:04.947 --> 58:07.682
A little bit 'cause they're
so cute. They're so sweet.

58:07.715 --> 58:09.784
They are, um..

58:09.818 --> 58:12.221
They don't really watch.
They would never watch porn.

58:12.253 --> 58:15.824
They're fundamentalist, they're
fundamentalist Christians, so..

58:17.293 --> 58:19.662
- That's the worst.
- Careful. I used to be one.

58:19.695 --> 58:22.632
- Hm. Joe used to be
a youth pastor.

58:22.664 --> 58:24.534
- What?
- In a different life.

58:24.567 --> 58:26.269
A long time ago.
- Okay.

58:26.302 --> 58:28.237
We met in this chat room. He
was teaching me how to dance...

58:28.269 --> 58:30.606
- Harlow, come on.
Baby, please.

58:32.875 --> 58:34.076
Thank you.

58:34.110 --> 58:37.179
- You guys, um, about ready
to order? Do you need more time?

58:37.211 --> 58:39.681
- Yeah, I think we, uh..
You know we..

58:39.715 --> 58:42.151
Yeah, let... let's get, um

58:42.184 --> 58:46.589
some blue Toro fin

58:46.621 --> 58:51.159
uh, with the shaved truffles,
the shaved black truffles.

58:51.193 --> 58:54.263
Um, let's get
the shrimp tempura roll

58:54.295 --> 58:57.065
the dragon roll,
the rainbow roll.

58:57.099 --> 58:59.302
You eat all, you can eat all this, right?
- Oh, yeah...

58:59.335 --> 59:00.702
Just get us, get us

59:00.737 --> 59:04.340
<i>a, a big boat of, a bunch of
fucking sushi or something.</i>

59:04.373 --> 59:06.342
- Absolutely. Anything else?
- Thank you.

59:06.375 --> 59:08.878
Thank you.

59:08.911 --> 59:10.547
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

59:12.847 --> 59:14.349
You wanna help me out?
- Oh, yeah.

59:14.382 --> 59:17.252
So Fox Ryder

59:17.286 --> 59:20.088
would love to take you guys up
on your offer.

59:20.121 --> 59:21.222
I'm sorry. Who?

59:21.255 --> 59:23.893
Fox Ryder. It's my new name.

59:25.393 --> 59:27.028
I beg your pardon?

59:27.061 --> 59:28.998
Um...

59:29.030 --> 59:32.101
I can't really use
the name Brent right now

59:32.134 --> 59:35.605
because, uh..

59:35.637 --> 59:38.173
...because Cobra trademarked it

59:38.206 --> 59:40.375
behind my back.

59:40.409 --> 59:43.246
- Well, fuck Cobra.
You are Brent Corrigan.

59:44.380 --> 59:46.615
- Yeah, but you know,
people will know it's me.

59:46.648 --> 59:49.384
I'm Fox. You know, it's good. Don't you think...
- No. Fuck that.

59:49.418 --> 59:52.622
Fuck. No. No Fox.
No fucking Fox.

59:52.655 --> 59:56.626
Right, this is,
this is about branding.

59:56.659 --> 59:59.961
You're Brent fucking Corrigan.
That's it, alright?

59:59.994 --> 01:00:02.632
And if you can't use your name

01:00:02.664 --> 01:00:04.601
then there's no fucking deal.

01:00:07.335 --> 01:00:11.139
Look, you have to do this video.

01:00:11.172 --> 01:00:13.041
We're all gonna get rich.

01:00:13.074 --> 01:00:16.378
You know how fucking rich
we're gonna get off of this?

01:00:16.411 --> 01:00:19.314
And if Stephen is the only one
standing in your way..

01:00:21.315 --> 01:00:25.020
...then we'll take care of it.
Okay?

01:00:25.054 --> 01:00:27.657
Seriously.
- Great.

01:00:30.391 --> 01:00:33.195
Hm. Put your money
where your mouth is.

01:00:35.697 --> 01:00:36.632
Okay.

01:00:39.434 --> 01:00:40.369
Ah.

01:00:58.253 --> 01:00:58.987
Hm.

01:01:00.956 --> 01:01:03.425
<i>Hello?
- Stephen, it's Joe.</i>

01:01:03.458 --> 01:01:06.961
<i>The Viper Boyz.
- Who?</i>

01:01:06.994 --> 01:01:09.731
- Joe from Viper Boyz.
S... Surely you've heard of us.

01:01:09.764 --> 01:01:11.400
Listen, we're big fans

01:01:11.432 --> 01:01:14.704
and, uh, we're gonna use Brent
in a little thing.

01:01:14.737 --> 01:01:18.340
So, uh, I understand that
there's a, um, contract thing...

01:01:18.373 --> 01:01:20.909
- Nobody works with Brent.
He's mine.

01:01:20.943 --> 01:01:22.278
Alright, well.

01:01:22.311 --> 01:01:25.347
Come on, I mean,
let's, let's at least discuss

01:01:25.380 --> 01:01:27.717
an arrangement, right,
or an agreement...

01:01:27.750 --> 01:01:30.119
- You want to come to some
sort of agreement? Alright.

01:01:30.152 --> 01:01:33.722
<i>- Yeah.
- Pay me eighty percent of what you make and we'll talk.</i>

01:01:33.755 --> 01:01:36.458
<i>- Eighty percent?
What the fuck?</i>

01:01:36.492 --> 01:01:38.461
- Take it or leave it.
- "Take it or leave it?"

01:01:38.494 --> 01:01:40.930
Fuck you! Alright? Lookit.

01:01:40.963 --> 01:01:42.832
You're gonna fucking
let Brent go

01:01:42.864 --> 01:01:44.399
or I'm gonna kick
the fucking shit out of you.

01:01:44.432 --> 01:01:47.202
How's that?
How the fuck is that?

01:01:47.235 --> 01:01:48.269
<i>You fucking faggot!</i>

01:01:48.302 --> 01:01:49.471
- Who the fuck do you think
you are?

01:01:49.503 --> 01:01:51.272
<i>- The fucking Viper Boyz!
- I've never heard of you.</i>

01:01:51.306 --> 01:01:53.742
If you were a real producer,
I would have heard of you.

01:01:53.775 --> 01:01:55.411
So that means your work is shit.

01:01:55.443 --> 01:01:57.112
<i>- What the fuck?
- Go fuck yourself.</i>

01:01:58.780 --> 01:02:00.815
Hello? Hello?

01:02:00.849 --> 01:02:03.952
Motherfucker! Motherfucker!

01:02:03.985 --> 01:02:05.453
Oh, fuckin'..

01:02:05.487 --> 01:02:08.023
Fuck! Fuck!

01:02:09.391 --> 01:02:10.492
Fuck!

01:02:13.027 --> 01:02:15.130
<i>- Okay, I've seen you
do it enough.</i>

01:02:15.164 --> 01:02:16.132
<i>Uh, uh..</i>

01:02:16.164 --> 01:02:17.500
What are you doing? Stop it.

01:02:17.532 --> 01:02:19.335
<i>- Action.
- No. Stop.</i>

01:02:19.367 --> 01:02:23.005
<i>Please.
- Here we have King Cobra.</i>

01:02:23.038 --> 01:02:23.838
<i>Porn producer..</i>

01:02:25.840 --> 01:02:27.876
<i>...whose neighbors
have no idea..</i>

01:02:30.512 --> 01:02:31.447
Oh.

01:02:50.965 --> 01:02:54.135
- Stephen?
- Hey, is that you?

01:02:54.168 --> 01:02:57.138
<i>How are you?
- Not so great, thanks to you.</i>

01:02:59.041 --> 01:03:02.778
- Listen. I just want to say
that I am sorry.

01:03:07.114 --> 01:03:08.150
Me, too.

01:03:10.452 --> 01:03:13.088
Look, can we try and just

01:03:13.121 --> 01:03:16.057
just put this behind us somehow?

01:03:16.090 --> 01:03:19.360
- Stephen, I'm grateful for
everything you've done for me

01:03:19.393 --> 01:03:21.429
but I just want to be
on my own now, okay?

01:03:22.530 --> 01:03:26.467
Look, I completely understand

01:03:26.501 --> 01:03:29.472
and, uh, I'm sorry
for being overbearing.

01:03:31.172 --> 01:03:32.907
I think
I let my personal feelings

01:03:32.940 --> 01:03:34.442
get in the way of our business.

01:03:34.476 --> 01:03:36.912
I... I'm gonna call my lawyer.

01:03:36.945 --> 01:03:38.347
I'll have him
draw up a contract

01:03:38.380 --> 01:03:41.517
that, uh, will hopefully
make the both of us very happy.

01:03:41.550 --> 01:03:45.287
- That would be great.
Thank you.

01:03:45.320 --> 01:03:48.390
<i>You really are very special.</i>

01:03:48.422 --> 01:03:49.323
I just..

01:03:50.958 --> 01:03:53.596
I got scared
at the thought of losing you.

01:03:55.630 --> 01:03:57.966
<i>You'd better have
you're A game on, though.</i>

01:03:58.000 --> 01:03:59.300
<i>I'm auditioning
someone tonight</i>

01:03:59.333 --> 01:04:00.635
<i>and I think
he's the next Brent.</i>

01:04:02.971 --> 01:04:04.173
Oh, really?

01:04:04.206 --> 01:04:07.242
- Yeah, he's gorgeous
and, uh, very well hung

01:04:07.275 --> 01:04:10.578
so don't be jealous.

01:04:10.612 --> 01:04:11.713
<i>- I'll try.
- Mm..</i>

01:04:13.648 --> 01:04:16.918
Alright, well, I'll talk to you soon.
- Alright. Bye.

01:04:34.603 --> 01:04:35.538
Thank you.

01:04:42.677 --> 01:04:44.913
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:04:48.650 --> 01:04:52.387
<i>You look great.
- Thanks. You do, too.</i>

01:04:52.420 --> 01:04:54.689
<i>- And I like your jacket.
- I just got it.</i>

01:04:54.722 --> 01:04:56.692
<i>- Oh.
- Cool vest.</i>

01:04:56.724 --> 01:04:59.161
Thanks.

01:05:01.730 --> 01:05:03.699
I read about

01:05:03.731 --> 01:05:07.135
that whole, uh, scandal.

01:05:07.168 --> 01:05:10.672
You were 17? That's wild.

01:05:10.706 --> 01:05:11.974
<i>Yeah. I know.</i>

01:05:12.007 --> 01:05:14.275
Um, Stephen and I are settling

01:05:14.309 --> 01:05:16.345
so things are,
things are looking good.

01:05:16.378 --> 01:05:17.680
Good.

01:05:21.717 --> 01:05:26.221
Um, I'm starting my own site.

01:05:26.253 --> 01:05:29.357
I'm gonna write, produce,
direct, have control.

01:05:32.427 --> 01:05:34.997
- I thought you wanted to be
a filmmaker.

01:05:35.030 --> 01:05:36.599
<i>Yeah. I am.</i>

01:05:38.367 --> 01:05:40.303
Like, real filmmaking.

01:05:43.472 --> 01:05:45.708
Uh, I, I mean

01:05:45.740 --> 01:05:49.711
<i>I'm... I'm figuring
things out still. It's..</i>

01:05:49.744 --> 01:05:53.614
Anyway I was, I was hoping
that, um

01:05:53.648 --> 01:05:55.584
you know, maybe
you'd wanna be a part of it.

01:05:57.652 --> 01:06:00.556
I would, I would

01:06:00.588 --> 01:06:03.257
but I'm kinda seeing someone
right now and..

01:06:03.291 --> 01:06:05.227
<i>Oh.</i>

01:06:05.260 --> 01:06:07.730
He's not really cool with me

01:06:07.762 --> 01:06:10.665
doing that stuff, so..

01:06:10.699 --> 01:06:12.634
<i>No offense and no judgment.</i>

01:06:12.666 --> 01:06:14.603
- Well, that's okay.
I understand.

01:06:16.538 --> 01:06:19.041
Uh, I didn't realize
you were dating someone.

01:06:20.608 --> 01:06:23.244
- Well, it doesn't mean
we can't sit down

01:06:23.277 --> 01:06:26.247
have dinner, conversation,
right?

01:06:28.682 --> 01:06:30.686
Yeah. Yeah.

01:06:33.789 --> 01:06:36.325
<i># Ooh, ooh, ooh, honey ##</i>

01:06:44.132 --> 01:06:47.135
<i>- Danny. Hello.
- Hello.</i>

01:06:49.304 --> 01:06:51.472
<i>Welcome to my home.</i>

01:06:51.505 --> 01:06:54.777
- Nice neighborhood.
- Thank you.

01:06:54.809 --> 01:06:57.746
Why don't you come on in?
The, uh, studio is downstairs.

01:07:01.148 --> 01:07:04.219
<i>How was your trip?
- It was easy.</i>

01:07:04.251 --> 01:07:06.621
<i>- Great.
- Oh, good.</i>

01:07:08.590 --> 01:07:10.526
<i>Make yourself comfortable.
Have a seat.</i>

01:07:11.827 --> 01:07:15.330
Oh, love this jacket.

01:07:15.362 --> 01:07:18.768
- Oh, thanks. It's Diesel.
- Hm.

01:07:23.871 --> 01:07:24.806
Hm.

01:07:29.510 --> 01:07:31.779
Well, you're even sexier
than your photos.

01:07:31.813 --> 01:07:34.782
- Thanks. You know, all of your
performers are so hot.

01:07:34.815 --> 01:07:37.786
So it's an honor
to be considered.

01:07:40.621 --> 01:07:42.790
It's my pleasure.

01:07:42.824 --> 01:07:45.693
Thank you for reaching out.

01:07:45.726 --> 01:07:48.362
<i>- I mean,
I could use the extra cash</i>

01:07:48.396 --> 01:07:50.666
and I jerk off

01:07:50.699 --> 01:07:54.168
all the time at home.

01:07:54.202 --> 01:07:56.205
Might as well get paid for it.

01:07:56.237 --> 01:07:57.739
That's right. Damn.

01:07:59.541 --> 01:08:02.111
You, uh, still

01:08:02.143 --> 01:08:04.479
need to audition for me first.

01:08:18.158 --> 01:08:20.362
<i>Oh, yeah. Oh, beautiful.</i>

01:08:32.908 --> 01:08:34.176
<i>Oh, oh, my.</i>

01:08:35.911 --> 01:08:36.810
That's all you?

01:08:39.279 --> 01:08:40.247
Yeah.

01:08:46.720 --> 01:08:48.923
<i>- You're putting your shoes
back on?</i>

01:08:48.957 --> 01:08:50.893
Yeah, it's part of my look.

01:08:52.894 --> 01:08:55.395
- Why don't you
let me have a look at that ass?

01:08:58.265 --> 01:09:00.402
Not yet.

01:09:00.435 --> 01:09:03.772
Why don't you take a seat
right over here?

01:09:09.944 --> 01:09:10.880
<i>Yeah?</i>

01:09:21.654 --> 01:09:23.658
I got a great ass

01:09:23.692 --> 01:09:25.261
and a big cock.

01:09:26.761 --> 01:09:29.932
I know how to use it.
I know how to use it.

01:09:33.935 --> 01:09:37.773
<i>- Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
- Alright, hey.</i>

01:09:37.805 --> 01:09:40.808
Would you be in the scene
that we shoot?

01:09:42.810 --> 01:09:44.679
No.

01:09:44.712 --> 01:09:45.747
Well, then...

01:09:47.649 --> 01:09:49.585
...that's not part
of the audition.

01:09:56.658 --> 01:10:00.329
Oh, my God. Oh, beautiful.

01:10:04.599 --> 01:10:06.969
Wow. That is just...

01:10:07.002 --> 01:10:10.906
<i>- Hey. I said look.
Don't touch.</i>

01:10:14.309 --> 01:10:16.545
- I'm usually the one who calls
the shots around here.

01:10:16.578 --> 01:10:19.581
Alright, you're usually the one
that calls the shots, huh?

01:10:21.949 --> 01:10:24.485
Tops always
secretly want a bottom.

01:10:27.822 --> 01:10:29.425
Oh, my God.

01:10:31.458 --> 01:10:33.729
Oh, my God.

01:10:35.596 --> 01:10:39.534
<i>- Yeah, you like that?
- Oh, yes. Right there. Yeah. Oh.</i>

01:10:40.702 --> 01:10:41.936
<i>Oh, yeah.</i>

01:10:45.573 --> 01:10:47.409
<i>Yeah.</i>

01:10:47.442 --> 01:10:49.377
- You like that?
- Oh, yeah.

01:10:50.979 --> 01:10:52.780
Oh, that's good.

01:11:04.359 --> 01:11:06.628
- Is that what you like to do,
huh?

01:11:06.661 --> 01:11:08.864
Just touch all these boys
whenever you want?

01:11:11.432 --> 01:11:13.002
So what if I do?

01:11:15.804 --> 01:11:17.006
<i>Who gives a fuck?</i>

01:12:13.127 --> 01:12:14.496
Fuck.

01:12:37.118 --> 01:12:38.587
Jesus.

01:12:43.190 --> 01:12:45.527
Did you have to be
so fucking messy?

01:12:54.868 --> 01:12:57.738
Fuck. You did it.
- I did it.

01:12:57.771 --> 01:12:59.740
For everyone who's ever taken
advantage of.

01:12:59.774 --> 01:13:00.943
Okay.

01:13:04.546 --> 01:13:07.516
Let's get you cleaned up.

01:13:07.548 --> 01:13:09.551
- And then what?
Then what do we do?

01:13:11.552 --> 01:13:13.521
- Then we'll take
whatever we want..

01:13:15.756 --> 01:13:17.859
...and we'll set
the fucking house on fire.

01:13:24.899 --> 01:13:28.036
Hey, you did a good job.

01:13:28.069 --> 01:13:29.104
Good job.

01:13:30.204 --> 01:13:31.206
Good job, Harlow.

01:13:41.582 --> 01:13:42.951
<i>New developments tonight</i>

01:13:42.984 --> 01:13:44.553
<i>concerning a deadly fire.</i>

01:13:44.586 --> 01:13:47.222
It is now
a murder investigation.

01:13:47.255 --> 01:13:50.692
Police say the man who lived
in this home had been stabbed

01:13:50.725 --> 01:13:53.495
<i>his throat slashed,
and last night's fire</i>

01:13:53.528 --> 01:13:55.963
<i>was an attempt
to cover up the crime.</i>

01:13:55.997 --> 01:13:59.067
<i>We also know that the victim
was involved with pornography.</i>

01:13:59.100 --> 01:14:01.803
- At this point we do not have
a specific motive

01:14:01.836 --> 01:14:05.673
uh, but we are definitely interested
in his pornography business

01:14:05.707 --> 01:14:07.843
and you know, people who may
have been involved with him.

01:14:50.150 --> 01:14:52.052
<i>- I got the DA
on the line for you.</i>

01:14:52.086 --> 01:14:53.989
<i>- You have to understand
how this story sounds</i>

01:14:54.021 --> 01:14:56.257
<i>to an outsider.</i>

01:14:56.291 --> 01:14:59.661
<i>Without Stephen in the picture,
you're free from his contract.</i>

01:14:59.694 --> 01:15:00.729
I know..

01:15:04.231 --> 01:15:06.234
...but I had nothing to do
with this.

01:15:07.902 --> 01:15:09.003
I swear.

01:15:10.738 --> 01:15:13.008
Why would I bring myself in here
if I did?

01:15:16.010 --> 01:15:18.179
Do you have any proof at all

01:15:18.212 --> 01:15:21.149
that Joe and Harlow did this?

01:15:21.181 --> 01:15:23.818
Other than the call and..

01:15:23.850 --> 01:15:27.922
<i>- Listen, Sean, but we need
to place them in the house</i>

01:15:27.956 --> 01:15:30.993
<i>and we need to know that you
didn't ask them to go there.</i>

01:16:17.372 --> 01:16:20.375
<i>- There he is.
- Hey.</i>

01:16:20.408 --> 01:16:23.311
<i>- Welcome to our abode.
- Cool.</i>

01:16:23.344 --> 01:16:26.814
- Come on, Harlow made snacks.
- Great. Great place.

01:16:37.859 --> 01:16:39.127
Come on in.

01:16:40.395 --> 01:16:42.097
<i>- Hey, Sean.
- Hey.</i>

01:16:42.130 --> 01:16:44.666
- Thank you so much for coming.
- Yeah.

01:16:48.002 --> 01:16:51.339
- So, um, are you hungry?
- No, thanks. I ate before...

01:16:51.372 --> 01:16:53.975
<i>- I made a cheese plate
for you.</i>

01:16:54.007 --> 01:16:57.345
We have double-cream Brie and
jack cheese, pepper jack cheese

01:16:57.377 --> 01:17:00.114
'cause I read that you like
pepper jack cheese. Um..

01:17:00.148 --> 01:17:02.250
<i>We have smoked Gouda
from Portugal.</i>

01:17:02.283 --> 01:17:04.419
Uh, I sliced some pomegranates
in there. They're just for show.

01:17:04.452 --> 01:17:06.320
I wanted to kind of emulate,
you know

01:17:06.354 --> 01:17:09.124
pulled from the bones
of vintage cheesemakers.

01:17:09.157 --> 01:17:10.291
<i>So, um..</i>

01:17:10.323 --> 01:17:11.792
Here, just try,
try a little bit.

01:17:11.826 --> 01:17:13.360
Please, please, please,
for me, for me.

01:17:13.394 --> 01:17:15.329
I worked all day. Come on. Okay.
- Uh, okay.

01:17:17.230 --> 01:17:18.699
<i>- I'm, like, addicted
to that shit.</i>

01:17:18.733 --> 01:17:20.135
<i>- It's good.
- It's good, right?</i>

01:17:20.167 --> 01:17:22.002
- Yeah.
- Let's do the champagne.

01:17:22.036 --> 01:17:23.137
<i>- Okay.
- To celebrate, right?</i>

01:17:23.171 --> 01:17:25.306
We're definitely celebrating.

01:17:25.338 --> 01:17:26.306
We celebrate all the time

01:17:26.340 --> 01:17:29.043
but we pull out
the really good stuff for you.

01:17:32.046 --> 01:17:33.649
Oh.
- Alright.

01:17:35.048 --> 01:17:37.918
- So, Sean,
I've been writing a script.

01:17:37.952 --> 01:17:39.820
I can't wait for you to read it.
I know you're gonna love it.

01:17:39.854 --> 01:17:41.990
- It's great.
- It's, it's about..

01:17:42.023 --> 01:17:44.225
- So we have all these really fast cars.
- Yeah.

01:17:44.257 --> 01:17:45.292
- And, um...
- Tell him what it's called.

01:17:45.326 --> 01:17:47.695
- It's, it's called
"The Fast And The Curious. "

01:17:47.729 --> 01:17:49.097
- Uh-huh.
- Cool.

01:17:49.130 --> 01:17:50.265
- Yes.
- That's rad, right?

01:17:50.297 --> 01:17:52.466
Yeah, that sounds great.

01:17:52.500 --> 01:17:54.335
<i>- Yeah.
- Awesome.</i>

01:17:54.368 --> 01:17:55.937
To "The Fast And The Curious. "

01:18:01.743 --> 01:18:04.446
Man, I cannot wait to direct
the shit out of this movie.

01:18:04.479 --> 01:18:07.481
- Fuck, yeah.
- Hey, photo op, huh?

01:18:07.515 --> 01:18:09.918
Get together with Harlow.
- Yeah.

01:18:09.951 --> 01:18:11.019
Yeah.

01:18:12.753 --> 01:18:14.421
<i>Alright, get in there.</i>

01:18:15.756 --> 01:18:17.458
<i>That's good.</i>

01:18:17.492 --> 01:18:19.226
Alright.

01:18:19.260 --> 01:18:22.363
Do one with shirts off. Come on.

01:18:22.395 --> 01:18:24.398
<i>Give our customers
a little tease</i>

01:18:24.431 --> 01:18:26.367
<i>of what they're getting
into here.</i>

01:18:26.399 --> 01:18:28.869
- Yeah.
- I've been working out extra hard for you.

01:18:28.903 --> 01:18:30.405
- Thanks.
- Feel.

01:18:32.239 --> 01:18:33.274
Nice.

01:18:34.809 --> 01:18:36.344
<i>Look at that plank.</i>

01:18:38.912 --> 01:18:40.314
<i>Alright.</i>

01:18:41.849 --> 01:18:42.918
Hot.

01:18:46.820 --> 01:18:47.956
A little kiss.

01:18:55.262 --> 01:18:58.766
Seanny baby, what's wrong?
You gotta loosen up.

01:18:58.800 --> 01:19:01.836
- I'm sorry. I... I just,
I, I can't concentrate. Um..

01:19:01.868 --> 01:19:04.104
Why?

01:19:04.137 --> 01:19:06.474
Can we just, y... you know

01:19:06.506 --> 01:19:08.442
talk about
the elephant in the room?

01:19:10.877 --> 01:19:13.413
What elephant?

01:19:13.447 --> 01:19:15.315
Stephen.

01:19:15.349 --> 01:19:18.153
Uh, What about him?
He's gone.

01:19:18.185 --> 01:19:20.788
I know. Why?

01:19:20.822 --> 01:19:22.556
- Maybe he pissed off
the wrong person.

01:19:22.590 --> 01:19:26.027
- Uh, we... we were just about
to come to an agreement.

01:19:26.060 --> 01:19:28.296
<i>- About this?
- Yeah.</i>

01:19:30.597 --> 01:19:34.536
No. There's no way. No way.

01:19:34.569 --> 01:19:36.571
He wasn't gonna fucking budge.

01:19:36.604 --> 01:19:39.507
- Please, just tell me
what happened.

01:19:39.539 --> 01:19:42.010
Do you want to talk?

01:19:42.042 --> 01:19:45.313
<i>- Yes.
- Alright. Let's talk.</i>

01:19:49.417 --> 01:19:51.486
- Haven't you guys
seen anything online?

01:19:53.587 --> 01:19:56.423
You know, people think
I'm behind it.

01:19:56.457 --> 01:19:58.326
But it's good now.

01:19:58.359 --> 01:20:00.929
We'll make the movie
and be rich.

01:20:00.962 --> 01:20:04.532
Yeah, if you didn't do it,
then people will know soon enough.

01:20:04.564 --> 01:20:05.866
- What do you mean
if I didn't do it?

01:20:05.899 --> 01:20:07.835
You know I didn't do it.
- Do I?

01:20:09.470 --> 01:20:11.907
We'll know you didn't do it
as soon as we shoot our movie.

01:20:15.109 --> 01:20:16.945
- When you said
you'd fix things

01:20:16.978 --> 01:20:18.913
I didn't know
this is what you meant.

01:20:19.646 --> 01:20:21.248
Please.

01:20:21.282 --> 01:20:23.918
It's exactly
what you fucking wanted.

01:20:23.951 --> 01:20:26.188
<i>- Yeah, I mean,
besides it's too late.</i>

01:20:31.559 --> 01:20:34.462
It was quick.
He never saw it comin'.

01:20:39.233 --> 01:20:42.369
You know, it's sick,
but seeing that fucker go down..

01:20:43.904 --> 01:20:47.007
...made me feel so good inside,
like I got revenge.

01:20:49.277 --> 01:20:50.511
Revenge on who?

01:20:53.914 --> 01:20:54.850
My stepdad.

01:20:54.882 --> 01:20:57.952
I never told anybody
that he used to rape me.

01:20:57.984 --> 01:21:01.188
I didn't want to bring shame
to my family.

01:21:01.221 --> 01:21:03.390
When I finally got the courage

01:21:03.423 --> 01:21:06.394
to tell my family
that I was gay..

01:21:08.162 --> 01:21:10.198
...he calls me a fag
and he convinces my mom

01:21:10.230 --> 01:21:12.166
to kick me out of the house.

01:21:14.969 --> 01:21:18.538
Anyway, let's not,
let's not talk about that shit.

01:21:18.572 --> 01:21:22.176
Come on, we're celebrating.
I don't care about that shit.

01:21:23.476 --> 01:21:25.579
Two tears in the bucket.
Motherfuck it.

01:21:26.646 --> 01:21:29.384
- So we're gonna see you
on Sunday?

01:21:29.417 --> 01:21:31.653
- Yeah, you know,
looking forward to it.

01:21:36.556 --> 01:21:38.559
- And you're gonna be
a good boy, right?

01:21:40.728 --> 01:21:41.930
Yeah.

01:21:47.702 --> 01:21:49.137
Alright.

01:21:50.237 --> 01:21:51.172
Good.

01:22:04.752 --> 01:22:05.687
Alright.

01:22:23.470 --> 01:22:24.672
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

01:22:45.025 --> 01:22:47.095
I'm sorry

01:22:47.127 --> 01:22:51.432
for everything
you... you went through and..

01:22:53.400 --> 01:22:55.603
...I'm here for you
no matter what, okay?

01:22:57.704 --> 01:22:58.739
Thank you.

01:23:00.173 --> 01:23:02.310
Aw. What do you want to do?

01:23:02.342 --> 01:23:04.578
I'll take you anywhere.
- I don't know.

01:23:04.612 --> 01:23:07.515
I actually kind of just
want to make dinner

01:23:07.547 --> 01:23:09.449
and, like, watch a movie maybe.

01:23:09.483 --> 01:23:12.354
- Mm-hmm. Okay. Come on.
- Okay.

01:23:22.063 --> 01:23:24.198
Hey, Joe,
do you think in heaven

01:23:24.230 --> 01:23:27.167
you can just eat as much
as you want and never get full?

01:23:28.601 --> 01:23:30.171
Sure. Whatever.

01:23:38.845 --> 01:23:39.780
Hey, Joe.

01:23:41.681 --> 01:23:43.684
Do you think
Stephen went to heaven or hell?

01:23:45.319 --> 01:23:47.655
- Heaven.
- Really?

01:23:50.623 --> 01:23:53.226
You know, I was thinkin'

01:23:53.260 --> 01:23:57.032
maybe we could join my parents
sometime at church.

01:23:58.666 --> 01:24:01.369
Oh. Whatever you want, baby.

01:24:10.644 --> 01:24:13.815
Harlow... what have we done?

01:24:15.850 --> 01:24:18.787
- Hey. We did
what we had to do.

01:24:20.121 --> 01:24:23.190
We had to do.
- Okay.

01:24:25.225 --> 01:24:27.862
Alright. Alright.

01:24:30.898 --> 01:24:33.568
Shit! Fuck!

01:24:33.600 --> 01:24:36.304
- Alright, alright, alright,
don't freak out.

01:24:36.337 --> 01:24:39.740
<i>Fuck! Fuck!</i>

01:24:39.773 --> 01:24:41.476
<i>- Driver, passenger,
let me see your hands!</i>

01:24:41.509 --> 01:24:42.710
- What did we do?
- Listen, listen, listen.

01:24:42.743 --> 01:24:45.545
No matter what happens, I will
never stop loving you, okay?

01:24:45.578 --> 01:24:48.782
Never. I love you.
- I love you so fuckin' much.

01:24:48.815 --> 01:24:51.519
<i>- Driver and passenger,
let me see your hands!</i>

01:24:51.551 --> 01:24:53.653
Fuck. Joe, put your hands up.

01:24:53.686 --> 01:24:55.789
<i>- Driver, with your left hand,
open the car door.</i>

01:24:55.823 --> 01:24:58.359
<i>Step out of the car,
turn your back towards me.</i>

01:25:23.350 --> 01:25:26.887
<i># Love me #</i>

01:25:26.921 --> 01:25:33.761
<i># Forever #</i>

01:25:35.796 --> 01:25:42.203
<i># I will always love you #</i>

01:25:59.752 --> 01:26:03.290
<i># Come to me my love #</i>

01:26:03.323 --> 01:26:07.194
<i># Come close to my heart #</i>

01:26:07.228 --> 01:26:12.766
<i># And always be mine #</i>

01:26:12.800 --> 01:26:16.971
<i># And love me #</i>

01:26:17.003 --> 01:26:23.711
<i># Forever... #</i>

01:26:24.677 --> 01:26:26.814
- Harlow!
- Joe!

01:26:26.846 --> 01:26:32.586
<i># I will always love you #</i>

01:26:33.686 --> 01:26:37.457
<i># Love me #</i>

01:26:37.490 --> 01:26:44.364
<i># Forever #</i>

01:27:11.625 --> 01:27:13.761
- Whoa.
- Hey.

01:27:14.927 --> 01:27:17.231
- Hey.
- What's up?

01:27:19.065 --> 01:27:20.835
Goin' for a ride.

01:27:34.715 --> 01:27:35.682
<i>Cut!</i>

01:27:37.318 --> 01:27:38.985
Great job.

01:27:39.019 --> 01:27:40.921
Alright. We got that.

01:27:40.953 --> 01:27:42.789
Let's go into a two shot

01:27:42.823 --> 01:27:44.892
where we wrestle around
a little bit on the floor.

01:27:44.925 --> 01:27:46.827
Uh, we'll do singles
and then a few inserts.

01:27:46.859 --> 01:27:47.862
<i>- Copy that.
- Great.</i>

01:27:47.895 --> 01:27:50.564
- Hey, how was I?
- Amazing.

01:27:50.596 --> 01:27:52.432
- Really?
You can tell me the truth.

01:27:52.466 --> 01:27:54.302
You did amazing.

01:27:54.335 --> 01:27:56.270
Hey, you really got
something special.

01:27:57.070 --> 01:27:58.305
Good job.

01:28:00.573 --> 01:28:03.510
Hey, what about shooting closer
to the lake? Maybe lose the tractor?

01:28:03.543 --> 01:28:06.579
- Actually, I really like the masculinity of the tractor.
- Great.

01:28:06.613 --> 01:28:07.780
- Thanks.
- Yes, sir.

01:28:07.814 --> 01:28:10.384
<i>Final touches,
then we're ready for a run through!</i>

01:28:10.417 --> 01:28:11.819
<i>- How's everything
look, Brent?</i>

01:28:11.851 --> 01:28:14.854
- Great.
Everything looks perfect.

01:28:14.887 --> 01:28:17.824
Actually, uh, can I get
a touch up on my ass? Thanks.

01:28:23.663 --> 01:28:24.599
Thanks.

01:28:28.101 --> 01:28:31.104
