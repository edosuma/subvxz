WEBVTT

00:02.336 --> 00:05.806
(upbeat pop song playing)

00:05.839 --> 00:07.808
* See, I just want to dead 'em

00:07.841 --> 00:08.809
* I don't know

00:08.842 --> 00:10.044
* Will I got to Heaven?

00:10.078 --> 00:11.279
* I don't know

00:11.312 --> 00:13.381
(beeping)

00:13.414 --> 00:15.516
* My life ain't perfect

00:15.549 --> 00:18.386
* I can't find the purpose...

00:29.863 --> 00:31.465
Harper!

00:34.168 --> 00:37.105
It's a party,
not a funeral.

00:37.138 --> 00:39.840
Uh, it was my mom's.

00:39.873 --> 00:42.343
God, you can be such
a bitch sometimes.

00:47.415 --> 00:48.382
(earpiece chirps)

00:51.385 --> 00:53.421
*Should I get a reverend?
*I don't know

00:53.454 --> 00:55.623
* Will I go to Heaven?
* I don't know

00:55.656 --> 00:57.791
* See, I just want to dead 'em
* I don't know

00:57.825 --> 01:01.295
* Will I go to Heaven?
* I don't know

01:03.397 --> 01:05.399
* The same, the same,
the same as usual *

01:05.433 --> 01:06.700
* It may just move you

01:06.734 --> 01:10.171
* On stage assume you know I can
choose just to make you move *

01:13.174 --> 01:15.476
* I'm making the news,
you're making a fool *

01:15.509 --> 01:17.678
(earpieces chirping)

01:19.447 --> 01:21.382
* You make me want to flirt

01:21.415 --> 01:23.717
* Make me want to whirl,
see your body on the floor *

01:23.751 --> 01:25.453
* See a trolley on the morgue

01:25.486 --> 01:27.355
* Anybody have a sword to break
this chain off? *

01:27.388 --> 01:28.689
* Somebody please help me take
this brain off *

01:28.722 --> 01:31.225
* I'm feeling like a slave,
this chain of hate *

01:31.259 --> 01:33.227
* It's trained to make
this brain an ape *

01:33.261 --> 01:35.596
* But no cane can take
this pain away *

01:35.629 --> 01:37.665
* So I pray and wait on a rainy
day and say... *

01:37.698 --> 01:39.567
* I just want to dead 'em
* I don't know

01:39.600 --> 01:40.434
(explosion)

01:40.468 --> 01:43.237
(screaming)

01:43.271 --> 01:45.473
(gunfire and screaming)

01:52.446 --> 01:54.448
* Will I go to Heaven?
* I don't know

01:54.482 --> 01:57.251
* See, I just want to dead 'em
* I don't know

01:57.285 --> 02:01.222
* Will I go to Heaven?
* I don't know.

02:01.255 --> 02:03.491
(thunder rumbling)

02:17.671 --> 02:20.208
(thunder crackling)

02:24.445 --> 02:27.181
(cell phone vibrating)

02:29.750 --> 02:31.652
(whispering):
Eppes.

02:33.787 --> 02:36.257
All right, all right, all right,
I'm on my way.

02:50.771 --> 02:51.639
(garbled radio transmission)

02:51.672 --> 02:53.707
DON: What do you got, Billy?
- Nothing.

02:53.741 --> 02:55.409
MEGAN: Did you recognize any of
them, Miss Simms?

02:55.443 --> 02:57.878
It all happened so fast,
I didn't even see them.

02:57.911 --> 02:59.413
What about before?

02:59.447 --> 03:01.382
Did you see anyone hanging
around, watching Ella?

03:01.415 --> 03:02.716
Everyone.

03:02.750 --> 03:03.917
I mean, she's Ella.

03:03.951 --> 03:05.886
- Right. Thanks very much.
- Mm-hmm.

03:05.919 --> 03:07.255
(clears throat)

03:07.288 --> 03:08.789
So, what,
straight-up grab?

03:08.822 --> 03:10.791
Yeah, with flash grenades
and automatic weapons,

03:10.824 --> 03:13.361
and they were professional
enough not to hurt anyone.

03:13.394 --> 03:14.662
Well, a lot
of witnesses.

03:14.695 --> 03:16.830
And not a good one
in the bunch.

03:16.864 --> 03:19.300
It's not any ordinary
club kid; it's Ella Pierce.

03:19.333 --> 03:21.835
What, that rich kid?
The party girl?

03:21.869 --> 03:24.705
Somebody's been trolling
Internet fan sites.

03:24.738 --> 03:27.541
Her father is
Warren Pierce.

03:27.575 --> 03:28.809
He's worth, like,
$2 billion.

03:28.842 --> 03:30.878
He's got textile factories
in every country

03:30.911 --> 03:33.447
in the world
without a minimum wage.

03:33.481 --> 03:34.748
He been notified?

03:34.782 --> 03:36.384
I talked to him on his plane
en route to Aspen.

03:36.417 --> 03:37.585
He's on his way back.

03:37.618 --> 03:38.752
MAN:
How you doing?

03:38.786 --> 03:39.753
- Jeff Upchurch.
- Hi, there.

03:39.787 --> 03:41.021
Critical Incident Response.

03:41.054 --> 03:42.122
Hey. Don Eppes.

03:42.155 --> 03:45.393
I was on my way to Guadalajara,
and they rerouted me.

03:45.426 --> 03:48.028
I'm guessing I was the nearest
specialist in the area, so...

03:48.061 --> 03:49.497
MEGAN:
Specialist in what?

03:49.530 --> 03:51.732
You guys do, what, ten,
15 kidnappings a year?

03:51.765 --> 03:53.967
Mexico City,
I do 15 a month.

03:54.001 --> 03:56.770
Work kidnappings
Europe, Asia, Afghanistan.

03:56.804 --> 03:59.473
It's always different,
always the same.

03:59.507 --> 04:01.008
So, what's different
about this one?

04:01.041 --> 04:02.743
I don't know yet.

04:02.776 --> 04:05.413
But the big money snatches
tend to put you in contact

04:05.446 --> 04:06.847
with a higher
class of lowlife.

04:06.880 --> 04:07.715
If they know
their business,

04:07.748 --> 04:08.616
and I'm certainly
guessing they do,

04:08.649 --> 04:10.918
we're looking at
simultaneous movement,

04:10.951 --> 04:12.853
expected payouts,
bargaining strategies.

04:12.886 --> 04:14.655
Lot of
variables here.

04:14.688 --> 04:16.056
You guys talking about
imperfect information games?

04:16.089 --> 04:17.024
I'm gonna check in SID.

04:17.057 --> 04:19.059
- You must be Professor Eppes.
- Pleasure.

04:19.092 --> 04:21.329
Bureau gave me a copy
of the action report

04:21.362 --> 04:22.763
from the Che Lobo kidnapping
last year.

04:22.796 --> 04:24.332
Got to tell you, I'm very
impressed with the maze math.

04:24.365 --> 04:25.633
Thanks.

04:25.666 --> 04:27.034
Could use some similar
inspiration on this one.

04:27.067 --> 04:29.036
Sounds like
you might have already started.

04:29.069 --> 04:30.904
You were just talking
about game theory, right?

04:30.938 --> 04:32.373
I was.

04:32.406 --> 04:33.941
Assuming that our kidnappers
are experienced,

04:33.974 --> 04:35.776
or they have benefited
from the experience

04:35.809 --> 04:37.611
of other kidnappers,
we can use

04:37.645 --> 04:40.614
an optimization method here
called a tabu search,

04:40.648 --> 04:42.716
which is basically
a way of excluding

04:42.750 --> 04:43.917
bad data.

04:43.951 --> 04:45.919
Places where
the kidnappers won't go

04:45.953 --> 04:47.888
to isolate where they will go.

04:47.921 --> 04:49.857
I guess that's why
they call it tabu, right?

04:49.890 --> 04:52.560
These kidnappers--
they're like a group of hikers.

04:52.593 --> 04:54.728
But they've mapped out
a very specific route.

04:54.762 --> 04:57.598
That route is complicated
by the terrain,

04:57.631 --> 04:59.800
by the density of foliage,
by dangerous animals,

04:59.833 --> 05:01.134
by water barriers.

05:01.168 --> 05:03.637
They deal with these obstacles
using their experience,

05:03.671 --> 05:06.440
using the accuracy
of their maps, their needs.

05:06.474 --> 05:09.377
And a tabu search can pinpoint
the optimal route

05:09.410 --> 05:10.844
that the hikers
can then choose.

05:10.878 --> 05:13.747
Now, assuming
that our kidnappers' goal

05:13.781 --> 05:14.948
is the safe collection

05:14.982 --> 05:16.617
of a ransom,
I can interpret

05:16.650 --> 05:18.552
their methodology;
I can predict their actions.

05:18.586 --> 05:20.454
Okay. How soon?

05:20.488 --> 05:21.889
Not a lot of information here,
you know?

05:21.922 --> 05:23.791
My projections
are going to be fairly general.

05:23.824 --> 05:24.958
(phone ringing)
But as always,

05:24.992 --> 05:27.461
the more data that comes in,
the more helpful I can be.

05:27.495 --> 05:28.662
Yeah. Eppes.

05:28.696 --> 05:30.631
(garbled radio transmission)

05:38.005 --> 05:40.808
Key's still in the ignition.

05:42.410 --> 05:43.611
I got something
a little something here.

05:43.644 --> 05:45.045
They left us a souvenir.

05:45.078 --> 05:47.481
Check this out.

05:49.917 --> 05:51.852
(machine whirring)

05:51.885 --> 05:52.686
MAN:
Warren Pierce

05:52.720 --> 05:54.888
is a criminal,
a ruthless parasite

05:54.922 --> 05:58.826
who lives off the backs
of the workers he exploits.

05:58.859 --> 06:00.928
His debt to society
has come due,

06:00.961 --> 06:02.796
and if he doesn't
pay it...

06:02.830 --> 06:04.064
(sobbing)

06:04.097 --> 06:05.799
...the People's
Nationalist Agenda

06:05.833 --> 06:09.136
will take it in the blood
of his daughter.

06:09.169 --> 06:11.472
We'll contact
Mr. Pierce

06:11.505 --> 06:13.106
with our demands
at noon today.

06:20.481 --> 06:23.050
DAVID: People's Nationalist
Agenda, aka the PNA.

06:23.083 --> 06:25.553
Anti-corporate,
anti-free trade.

06:25.586 --> 06:27.087
Anti-Warren Pierce.

06:27.120 --> 06:29.122
The guy who runs the Web site--
he calls himself Santee,

06:29.156 --> 06:30.123
but the Bureau's
counterterrorism unit--

06:30.157 --> 06:32.460
they don't have a face
to go with that name.

06:32.493 --> 06:34.061
They don't even think
it's one person.

06:34.094 --> 06:36.430
Thing is, we don't even have
any identifiable members.

06:36.464 --> 06:40.434
I mean, the banners go up
at antiglobalization protests,

06:40.468 --> 06:43.604
somebody spray-paints "PNA" at a
vandalized construction site,

06:43.637 --> 06:46.039
but there doesn't seem to be any
real, centralized organization.

06:46.073 --> 06:47.441
All right,
so maybe

06:47.475 --> 06:48.742
they're just messing
with us, you know?

06:48.776 --> 06:50.210
Maybe they're just hiding
behind these guys.

06:50.243 --> 06:53.113
Okay, so the van used
in the abduction was registered

06:53.146 --> 06:56.717
to a Diamond Lane Rentals,
reported stolen last week.

06:56.750 --> 06:58.586
Start with anyone who'd know
the girl's schedule, right?

06:58.619 --> 07:00.654
That's got to be half
of Los Angeles.

07:00.688 --> 07:01.822
The good-looking half.

07:01.855 --> 07:03.891
These celebrity socialites--
they live electronically,

07:03.924 --> 07:06.927
so I'll go deep on the e-mails,
text messages,

07:06.960 --> 07:08.195
phone logs, the works.

07:08.228 --> 07:09.429
Yeah, good.

07:12.199 --> 07:14.434
So what happened
last night?

07:16.737 --> 07:19.473
I don't know. You know, it was
late, and I took the call.

07:19.507 --> 07:20.674
I thought I'd let you sleep.

07:20.708 --> 07:23.143
That's it? That's all
you're going to give me?

07:23.176 --> 07:24.812
(sighs)
That's all there is.

07:24.845 --> 07:26.213
Look, Don,
we both know

07:26.246 --> 07:28.148
things haven't been clicking
since Leah was killed.

07:28.181 --> 07:29.650
I think you just wanted me

07:29.683 --> 07:31.852
out of your face
for a few hours, right?

07:31.885 --> 07:33.754
I don't know.
Look, even if that's true,

07:33.787 --> 07:35.188
is it that big a deal?

07:35.222 --> 07:38.191
It's something
to talk about, yeah.

07:38.225 --> 07:40.694
Well, I mean, I'm in the middle
of a kidnapping here. Come on.

07:40.728 --> 07:43.063
All right.

07:43.096 --> 07:45.499
You know, I'll just wait
for a bank robbery.

07:46.600 --> 07:48.669
(door closes)

07:48.702 --> 07:50.571
Ever since Ella became
a media darling,

07:50.604 --> 07:52.072
a power partier,

07:52.105 --> 07:54.942
I've been waiting for
something like this to happen.

07:54.975 --> 07:58.512
And you never saw to it
that she got any security?

07:58.546 --> 08:00.280
She turned down
bodyguards.

08:00.313 --> 08:03.283
Said any kidnapper would pay
to give her back after two days.

08:03.316 --> 08:05.853
And with the joke,
you let the issue drop?

08:05.886 --> 08:08.522
That's not at all what I meant.

08:08.556 --> 08:09.790
Anything Ella

08:09.823 --> 08:11.191
ever asked for, ever needed,

08:11.224 --> 08:14.261
I've always given her gladly.

08:14.294 --> 08:16.997
What you need to understand,

08:17.030 --> 08:19.800
Mr. Pierce, is that ransom
is enough business

08:19.833 --> 08:21.635
to make a fellow
like yourself confused.

08:21.669 --> 08:22.836
Meaning?

08:22.870 --> 08:24.004
Kidnappers will position.

08:24.037 --> 08:26.306
They will establish
bargaining power.

08:26.339 --> 08:27.675
Gentleman such
as yourself

08:27.708 --> 08:29.042
that's used to
calling the shots,

08:29.076 --> 08:31.011
used to winning...

08:31.044 --> 08:32.780
You're asking me to be humble.

08:32.813 --> 08:33.981
I'm asking you to be smart.

08:34.014 --> 08:35.716
(phone ringing)

08:35.749 --> 08:37.718
Okay, this is
what we talked about.

08:37.751 --> 08:40.688
Want to stay calm,
engaged.

08:40.721 --> 08:42.155
Keep them on the phone
as long as possible.

08:42.189 --> 08:43.290
- Is everybody ready?
- All set.

08:43.323 --> 08:44.992
Whenever you are, sir.

08:57.771 --> 08:59.573
Hello.

08:59.607 --> 09:03.777
If this isn't Warren Pierce,
Ella Pierce is as good as dead.

09:03.811 --> 09:04.712
Who are you?

09:04.745 --> 09:06.279
Don't ask who I am.
Ask how much I want.

09:06.313 --> 09:09.316
I need to know
my daughter is all right.

09:10.684 --> 09:12.352
ELLA:
Dad? Daddy?

09:12.385 --> 09:14.354
(sobbing)

09:14.387 --> 09:15.623
Ella?

09:15.656 --> 09:16.590
(sobbing)

09:16.624 --> 09:17.758
Demand 1:

09:17.791 --> 09:19.059
shut down all of your company's

09:19.092 --> 09:20.761
sweatshops operating
in the Third World.

09:20.794 --> 09:21.962
If it's me you want...

09:21.995 --> 09:24.865
Demand 2:
$40 million in restitution

09:24.898 --> 09:27.167
paid to the thousands
of men, women and children

09:27.200 --> 09:30.638
your company has exploited
in the Third World.

09:30.671 --> 09:32.940
I'll give you $10 million.

09:34.842 --> 09:36.243
In a secured Swiss account.

09:36.276 --> 09:37.344
(beep)

09:37.377 --> 09:39.780
(click, dial tone)

09:39.813 --> 09:41.615
Guy's using a sat phone.
He's bouncing the signal.

09:41.649 --> 09:43.350
What the hell was that?

09:43.383 --> 09:44.251
A counteroffer.

09:44.284 --> 09:48.622
You're lowballing
on your daughter's life?

09:48.656 --> 09:50.257
I talked to him
in a language he understands.

09:50.290 --> 09:53.293
Do you understand
that they hung up on you?

09:53.326 --> 09:55.195
That you put your daughter's
life in more danger?

09:55.228 --> 09:56.697
He'll call back.

09:56.730 --> 09:59.066
And now, if
you'll excuse me,

09:59.099 --> 10:02.169
I'm going to make
arrangements for payment.

10:05.272 --> 10:07.340
MEGAN: Guys like that--
it's all about money and power.

10:07.374 --> 10:09.743
Actually, that was
the right call

10:09.777 --> 10:12.145
straight out of the playbook.

10:12.179 --> 10:13.747
He pays too much,
too fast, too soon,

10:13.781 --> 10:15.348
PNA's going to figure
they didn't ask enough.

10:15.382 --> 10:16.984
They're going to come back
looking for more.

10:17.017 --> 10:19.887
You really think he could be
operating out of your playbook?

10:19.920 --> 10:22.389
You got a different theory?

10:22.422 --> 10:25.826
That his daughter's just
another negotiable asset.

10:30.698 --> 10:32.700
You get this out of
your favorite head shop?

10:32.733 --> 10:37.771
No, Charles. This cannot be
purchased in any shop.

10:37.805 --> 10:40.040
I've constructed my own
Hero's fountain.

10:40.073 --> 10:41.942
Named after Hero
of Alexandria,

10:41.975 --> 10:42.976
the Greek mathematician

10:43.010 --> 10:44.377
and engineer.

10:44.411 --> 10:46.413
You see,
once the pressure is right,

10:46.446 --> 10:48.716
the water will flow
under its own power.

10:48.749 --> 10:50.818
And how is this part
of your achieving Zen, Larry?

10:50.851 --> 10:51.785
Einstein said

10:51.819 --> 10:53.921
religion should arise
from the experience

10:53.954 --> 10:56.423
of all things, natural
and spiritual,

10:56.456 --> 10:58.391
in a meaningful unity.

10:58.425 --> 11:02.395
Now, made from the parcels
of my former self,

11:02.429 --> 11:04.097
this fountain perfectly
analogizes

11:04.131 --> 11:07.901
the seamless integration of both
my physical and spiritual lives.

11:07.935 --> 11:09.703
AMITA: Shouldn't you be at the
FBI?

11:09.737 --> 11:12.239
The kidnapping
is all over the news.

11:12.272 --> 11:14.241
Oh, yeah. The ransom negotiation
cut short,

11:14.274 --> 11:16.409
so I may need
to rethink my tabu search.

11:16.443 --> 11:17.310
Maybe

11:17.344 --> 11:19.446
weight the data
with a Bayesian prior.

11:19.479 --> 11:22.049
While I condone none
of the major felonies,

11:22.082 --> 11:23.483
do have to say, kidnapping--

11:23.516 --> 11:26.920
that does hold a certain...
conceptual intrigue,

11:26.954 --> 11:28.255
this business

11:28.288 --> 11:31.925
of affixing value
to a human life.

11:31.959 --> 11:33.460
Oh, I think it's almost there.

11:33.493 --> 11:35.763
Observe, Charles:
water rising to a new level,

11:35.796 --> 11:37.965
as is my own hope.

11:45.138 --> 11:47.307
I'm out of here.

11:47.340 --> 11:49.042
It dawned on me
while I was looking

11:49.076 --> 11:50.878
at Larry's Zen rock garden.

11:50.911 --> 11:53.380
What? Larry has
a Zen rock garden?

11:53.413 --> 11:55.415
Yeah, actually, it was
his Hero fountain

11:55.448 --> 11:58.085
that got me going, but
it's an even longer story.

11:58.118 --> 12:00.520
Let's reconsider my hiker
analogy, all right?

12:00.553 --> 12:03.356
And think of a mudslide
falling in front of the hikers.

12:03.390 --> 12:05.492
It changes terrain,
it changes their direction.

12:05.525 --> 12:06.526
Right, okay.

12:06.559 --> 12:09.429
So my tabu search
accounted for the kidnappers

12:09.462 --> 12:12.332
following a planned path,
but with Pierce's counteroffer,

12:12.365 --> 12:14.267
they've had to
break off contact.

12:16.103 --> 12:18.305
They've essentially
been detoured.

12:18.338 --> 12:20.774
They have to find a new way
to get to their waterfall.

12:20.808 --> 12:22.209
We're expecting them to make
another ransom-oriented

12:22.242 --> 12:25.212
decision, to hike around
the mudslide, right?

12:25.245 --> 12:28.148
But I-I think they're going
to abandon that path completely.

12:28.181 --> 12:30.083
I think they're going
to find another way.

12:31.151 --> 12:32.920
Everyone down on the ground!

12:35.455 --> 12:37.490
Open the safe.

12:37.524 --> 12:39.159
So what do you think,
kill the Pierce girl

12:39.192 --> 12:40.293
and go underground?

12:40.327 --> 12:41.561
Oh, that would
be giving up.

12:41.594 --> 12:43.530
Essentially turning around.

12:43.563 --> 12:44.898
I based my analysis

12:44.932 --> 12:46.066
on the information the PNA
put up on their Web site:

12:46.099 --> 12:47.267
their stated goals,
their state of mind.

12:47.300 --> 12:49.636
I think they're going
to going to bulldoze

12:49.669 --> 12:51.471
through this mudslide.
I think they're going

12:51.504 --> 12:53.206
going to do something sudden,
something violent,

12:53.240 --> 12:54.908
something completely unexpected.

13:05.418 --> 13:07.420
LIZ: All right, so the safe
holds cash deliveries

13:07.454 --> 13:08.856
from payroll trucks
and they drop off

13:08.889 --> 13:10.891
two to $300,000
a day.

13:10.924 --> 13:12.826
But these geniuses
hit two hours

13:12.860 --> 13:14.194
after the money
went to the bank.

13:14.227 --> 13:16.029
So they got six, maybe
seven grand in petty cash.

13:16.063 --> 13:17.530
DON: Not the hit they were
hoping for.

13:17.564 --> 13:18.698
Their movements are really

13:18.731 --> 13:20.968
synchronized; it suggests
a high degree of discipline,

13:21.001 --> 13:23.036
a high degree of conviction.

13:23.070 --> 13:25.538
Let's not dance around it.
What are we thinking here?

13:25.572 --> 13:27.507
Judging by the way
she's balancing that rifle,

13:27.540 --> 13:29.009
my money says
it isn't even loaded.

13:29.042 --> 13:31.144
behind her back.be holding a gun

13:31.178 --> 13:33.346
I mean, look at this face.

13:33.380 --> 13:34.948
That is the face
of a scared little girl.

13:34.982 --> 13:37.084
So they lose the ransom,

13:37.117 --> 13:38.551
they hit Pierce's business,
but I don't get

13:38.585 --> 13:40.253
why drag the girl along?

13:40.287 --> 13:41.889
LIZ:
Puts her in the line of fire.

13:41.922 --> 13:45.926
Human shield, maybe it's
their counteroffer to Pierce.

13:45.959 --> 13:47.861
They placed her
in deliberate frame

13:47.895 --> 13:49.462
of that security camera.

13:49.496 --> 13:51.131
They want us to see her face.
They're asserting dominance.

13:51.164 --> 13:53.533
I think they just
want to violate

13:53.566 --> 13:55.568
Pierce and show him that
they control his destiny.

13:55.602 --> 13:58.471
That looks like an alpha to me.

13:58.505 --> 13:59.539
Think he's our mythical Santee?

13:59.572 --> 14:00.540
(ringing)

14:00.573 --> 14:03.510
Warner.

14:03.543 --> 14:05.412
What?

14:05.445 --> 14:07.180
Pierce just e-mailed
the PNA's Web site

14:07.214 --> 14:09.983
and told them he isn't paying.

14:10.017 --> 14:12.452
PIERCE: I've dealt with rogue
governments,

14:12.485 --> 14:13.586
guerilla fighters,

14:13.620 --> 14:15.622
organized crime.

14:15.655 --> 14:18.225
They all understand
the rules of negotiation.

14:18.258 --> 14:20.393
If these animals aren't
going to speak to me

14:20.427 --> 14:21.528
in a language
I can understand...

14:21.561 --> 14:23.163
Well, that's why
I'm here, sir.

14:23.196 --> 14:25.132
To help translate.

14:25.165 --> 14:27.000
Look, we both know
that if I cave in,

14:27.034 --> 14:28.468
they're going to bleed me dry.

14:28.501 --> 14:30.603
And I still won't get Ella back.

14:30.637 --> 14:32.305
That's always possible.

14:32.339 --> 14:33.540
So what was my choice?

14:33.573 --> 14:35.242
Well, you had a couple
of options, sir,

14:35.275 --> 14:37.244
the worst of which was
negotiate with the PNA

14:37.277 --> 14:38.378
without talking to me first.

14:38.411 --> 14:40.380
So you think I should back down?

14:40.413 --> 14:42.182
- Tell them I'll pay.
- No, you change

14:42.215 --> 14:44.617
your direction too quick,
it's just going to confuse them.

14:44.651 --> 14:45.919
We definitely don't
want these guys panicking.

14:45.953 --> 14:48.355
The next move is theirs.

14:48.388 --> 14:51.191
Let's just hope
it's not killing your daughter.

14:51.224 --> 14:53.593
You don't have much
of a bedside manner.

14:55.128 --> 14:56.196
Must be why

14:56.229 --> 14:58.531
I don't get invited
to many parties.

14:58.565 --> 14:59.632
DAVID:
Still trying to break

14:59.666 --> 15:01.168
into Ella Pierce's
e-mail account.

15:01.201 --> 15:02.369
It turns out it's encrypted.

15:02.402 --> 15:03.470
It's locked
with a software tool used

15:03.503 --> 15:06.573
primarily by IT programmers
at major corporations.

15:06.606 --> 15:08.275
That's funny, huh?

15:08.308 --> 15:09.476
I mean, why would
she be doing that?

15:09.509 --> 15:11.945
If you don't,
that stuff will turn up

15:11.979 --> 15:14.314
on some online
celebrity gossip site.

15:14.347 --> 15:15.715
You know the whole world
knows your business.

15:15.748 --> 15:18.318
Let me ask you something.
I mean, not about this.

15:18.351 --> 15:19.619
About Liz?

15:19.652 --> 15:21.188
Yeah, how'd you know?

15:21.221 --> 15:23.590
You asked permission to ask.

15:23.623 --> 15:25.658
Hey, I got to end it.

15:25.692 --> 15:28.361
I mean, it's just way
too complicated with work.

15:28.395 --> 15:30.663
The thing is, every time I do,

15:30.697 --> 15:31.531
we end up in bed.

15:31.564 --> 15:34.567
Hey, man, you guys
work funky hours,

15:34.601 --> 15:36.303
long stakeouts,

15:36.336 --> 15:37.637
you're dodging
bullets together.

15:37.670 --> 15:39.306
It sounds like adrenaline.

15:39.339 --> 15:41.174
I mean, adrenaline
is great, but, you know,

15:41.208 --> 15:43.676
I don't know if that's
a real relationship.

15:45.512 --> 15:47.280
I'm sorry, you wanted
to ask me a question.

15:47.314 --> 15:49.416
I think you just answered it.

15:51.251 --> 15:54.054
MEGAN: So what kind of lizard
decides that his daughter

15:54.087 --> 15:56.156
isn't worth a fraction
of his bank account?

15:56.189 --> 15:57.991
Loath as I am
to contradict you,

15:58.025 --> 16:00.493
the decision is so entirely
out of character.

16:00.527 --> 16:02.529
It suggests
true emotional anguish.

16:02.562 --> 16:06.166
Larry, what the hell would
you know about his character?

16:06.199 --> 16:07.700
I think what he's simply
pointing out is that

16:07.734 --> 16:10.537
Pierce has violated his own
corporate game theory.

16:11.738 --> 16:13.006
It's standard minimax.

16:13.040 --> 16:14.374
It's a tug of war,

16:14.407 --> 16:16.543
a demonstration
of brute strength

16:16.576 --> 16:19.579
between two opposing sides
where one side can pull

16:19.612 --> 16:21.648
the other side
across a center line.

16:21.681 --> 16:24.617
However, after
the competition started,

16:24.651 --> 16:26.153
one team can embarrass
the other

16:26.186 --> 16:27.554
by letting go of the rope.

16:27.587 --> 16:29.556
That team humiliates
its opponent,

16:29.589 --> 16:31.091
but they've lost.

16:31.124 --> 16:33.693
So essentially,
Pierce has let go of his rope.

16:33.726 --> 16:35.795
He's struck back
in the way least likely

16:35.828 --> 16:37.330
to achieve a positive result.

16:37.364 --> 16:39.399
Which runs counter
to the instincts responsible

16:39.432 --> 16:40.633
for his corporate success,

16:40.667 --> 16:42.669
ergo my observation
that his judgment

16:42.702 --> 16:45.538
is clouded by a high
state of distress.

16:45.572 --> 16:47.274
Yeah, but, Larry,

16:47.307 --> 16:48.575
I went through Ella's things,

16:48.608 --> 16:50.643
and I found letters
from her father,

16:50.677 --> 16:53.046
throughout her childhood
that were typed.

16:53.080 --> 16:55.348
They were dictated
to a secretary.

16:55.382 --> 16:57.550
I know, because his secretary's
name is cc'd on them.

16:57.584 --> 16:59.186
What kind of father
would do that?

16:59.219 --> 17:00.687
So you two

17:00.720 --> 17:01.554
just stick to the blackboard

17:01.588 --> 17:03.022
and I'll take care
of the profiling.

17:07.327 --> 17:10.230
I expect that from my brother.

17:10.263 --> 17:12.132
Any idea what's going on there?

17:12.165 --> 17:15.502
Yeah, some.

17:15.535 --> 17:17.770
So PNA put this up
ten minutes ago.

17:17.804 --> 17:21.541
The People's Nationalist Agenda
is not to be taken lightly.

17:21.574 --> 17:24.511
Their recent action
towards my father's

17:24.544 --> 17:28.148
corrupt business interests are
just a taste of what's to come

17:28.181 --> 17:31.318
until he responds
to the PNA's demands.

17:31.351 --> 17:33.620
Close the sweatshops.

17:33.653 --> 17:37.090
Pay the ransom.

17:37.124 --> 17:39.659
Sent directly to the national
news outlets as well.

17:39.692 --> 17:41.728
It'll be all over TV tonight.

17:41.761 --> 17:43.796
So what, he pisses on them,
they piss on him?

17:43.830 --> 17:46.133
All right, meanwhile,
we've made some headway

17:46.166 --> 17:47.567
on your alpha.

17:47.600 --> 17:49.702
He's looking more and more
like our "Santee."

17:49.736 --> 17:51.871
Facial recognition
software connected him

17:51.904 --> 17:54.741
to several antiglobalization
protests

17:54.774 --> 17:57.110
and then a gun store
robbery in Seattle,

17:57.144 --> 17:59.679
two months ago.
Similar MO.

17:59.712 --> 18:00.847
All the same characters.

18:00.880 --> 18:02.115
My guess is that
this is where they

18:02.149 --> 18:04.784
decided to graduate from tree
hugging and disorderly conduct

18:04.817 --> 18:06.619
to heavy felonies.

18:06.653 --> 18:08.221
The problem is
that Santee managed to keep

18:08.255 --> 18:10.390
his nose clean,
at least on paper.

18:10.423 --> 18:12.859
There's no rap sheet, no ID.

18:12.892 --> 18:15.662
20s, wanted, off the grid.

18:15.695 --> 18:17.330
Listen, um...

18:17.364 --> 18:19.566
I know this isn't
the right time to talk.

18:19.599 --> 18:22.535
But I just want to make sure
we make the time.

18:22.569 --> 18:24.671
I think so, too.
I mean, uh...

18:24.704 --> 18:25.638
We will.

18:26.739 --> 18:28.441
Okay.

18:34.214 --> 18:36.649
It's an MPEG file,
and from its resolution,

18:36.683 --> 18:38.518
I think it came
from a sat phone.

18:38.551 --> 18:40.487
DAVID:
Okay, how does that help us?

18:40.520 --> 18:42.355
I mean, if we had
a DTMF decoder...

18:42.389 --> 18:44.391
it's a dual-tone
multi-frequency.

18:44.424 --> 18:45.725
It's touchtone.

18:45.758 --> 18:47.560
You couldn't have just said
that to begin with?

18:47.594 --> 18:49.529
Yeah, but it wouldn't have
been as much fun.

18:50.797 --> 18:52.332
The decoder works kind

18:52.365 --> 18:53.566
of like a prism.

18:53.600 --> 18:55.535
Instead of refracting light

18:55.568 --> 18:58.338
into its individual frequencies,
its component colors,

18:58.371 --> 18:59.772
the decoder
separates the phone

18:59.806 --> 19:01.808
signal into different tones
and numeric values.

19:01.841 --> 19:03.843
From which we can
then decipher

19:03.876 --> 19:04.811
the actual phone number.

19:04.844 --> 19:06.813
Okay, where can we get
one of these things?

19:06.846 --> 19:08.781
If the kidnappers are using

19:08.815 --> 19:10.750
a land line or a
cell phone, you can

19:10.783 --> 19:12.952
buy a DTMF decoder from
a consumer electronics store.

19:12.985 --> 19:14.621
Right, but they're using

19:14.654 --> 19:16.356
a sat phone, so...

19:16.389 --> 19:17.890
Hacking a satellite signal
requires a little more

19:17.924 --> 19:19.959
sophistication,
but I can put a unit together.

19:19.992 --> 19:21.861
I mean, I built

19:21.894 --> 19:23.363
my first computer when I was 13.

19:23.396 --> 19:24.964
I know my way around
a circuit board.

19:24.997 --> 19:26.766
And, you know, the Electrical
Engineering Department

19:26.799 --> 19:28.601
has all the parts I need.

19:28.635 --> 19:30.637
All right, so If they're using
a satellite phone, this thing

19:30.670 --> 19:32.639
is going to tell us where they
were, not where they are now,

19:32.672 --> 19:34.674
- Right?
- Yeah, that's why

19:34.707 --> 19:35.742
I've been patiently waiting
here.

19:35.775 --> 19:36.643
I think the additional

19:36.676 --> 19:39.212
information has helped
my tabu search,

19:39.246 --> 19:41.781
and I think I have an idea where
the PNA might show up next.

19:44.884 --> 19:47.554
As far as hunches go,
I certainly played worse.

19:47.587 --> 19:49.322
They appear where he works,

19:49.356 --> 19:51.458
so his neighborhood
could be next.

19:51.491 --> 19:54.427
When it comes from Charlie,
it's kind of a hunch-plus.

19:54.461 --> 19:56.529
So I've heard.

19:56.563 --> 19:57.830
(computer beeping)

19:57.864 --> 19:59.732
Also heard some stuff about you.

20:02.335 --> 20:04.437
Yeah, like what?

20:04.471 --> 20:05.938
You like to run
with the tactical boys.

20:05.972 --> 20:08.808
The first through the door,
that sort of thing.

20:08.841 --> 20:11.378
Cowboy enough to get
your name out there,

20:11.411 --> 20:12.812
but not unsafe.

20:12.845 --> 20:15.282
I just had a few things
on my mind, man.

20:15.315 --> 20:17.784
Kicking in doors
and dodging bullets?

20:17.817 --> 20:19.386
That's my kind of therapy.

20:20.953 --> 20:22.922
I came up
through Special Forces.

20:22.955 --> 20:25.358
Nearly bounced off the walls
in that damn field office.

20:27.494 --> 20:29.629
You ever consider going for the
adrenaline fix full-time?

20:29.662 --> 20:31.030
You get to travel,

20:31.063 --> 20:33.433
leave the paperwork
to guys like...

20:33.466 --> 20:34.934
(chuckles)

20:34.967 --> 20:36.369
Well, you.

20:36.403 --> 20:38.305
(over radio):
Report of a silent alarm

20:38.338 --> 20:40.473
at 7626 East Ellendale.

20:40.507 --> 20:42.041
Ellendale, that's
two blocks from here.

20:42.074 --> 20:43.343
It's also Harper Simms' address.

20:43.376 --> 20:44.644
That's Ella Pierce's friend.

20:44.677 --> 20:46.012
(car starts)

20:52.919 --> 20:53.920
(honking)

20:57.590 --> 20:58.825
DAVID:
FBI! Nobody moves!

20:58.858 --> 21:00.360
Let me see your hands!

21:00.393 --> 21:01.794
You in the car!

21:01.828 --> 21:03.029
Up! Let me see them hands!

21:04.964 --> 21:06.333
Back off!

21:07.400 --> 21:09.001
It's never gonna happen.

21:36.429 --> 21:38.498
(car starting)

21:49.008 --> 21:52.612
What the hell
just happened here?

21:52.645 --> 21:55.314
Looks like our rescue mission
just turned into a manhunt.

22:02.622 --> 22:05.091
DAVID: All right, Harper, just
tell us what you saw.

22:05.124 --> 22:07.394
They were waving guns around.

22:07.427 --> 22:10.963
Yelling... I thought
I was going to die.

22:10.997 --> 22:12.432
And Ella?

22:12.465 --> 22:14.967
Was showing them
where everything was:

22:15.001 --> 22:17.570
the cash, my mom's jewelry,

22:17.604 --> 22:19.906
the safe.

22:19.939 --> 22:23.443
She was acting like
the brat that she is,

22:23.476 --> 22:24.677
except with a gun.

22:24.711 --> 22:28.448
And that loser Steffen,

22:28.481 --> 22:31.083
calling himself Santee now...

22:31.117 --> 22:34.053
You, uh,
you recognized Santee?

22:34.086 --> 22:37.023
Yes. Steffen Cavani-- the stoner
we went to high school with.

22:41.093 --> 22:42.862
Come on!
She's totally with him.

22:42.895 --> 22:43.696
Yes and no.
How no?

22:43.730 --> 22:45.865
She's young
and she's vulnerable,

22:45.898 --> 22:47.634
and she hasn't had
any contact

22:47.667 --> 22:49.636
with anyone
outside of her captors.

22:49.669 --> 22:51.538
What, like,
brainwashing?

22:51.571 --> 22:53.406
She would not be
the first person to identify

22:53.440 --> 22:54.974
with her victimizers
and then act accordingly.

22:55.007 --> 22:57.810
She's with them
a day and a half.

22:57.844 --> 23:00.379
You have no idea how quickly
someone's will can be broken.

23:02.181 --> 23:03.149
(sighing):
Mr. Pierce.

23:09.456 --> 23:11.458
You have my full cooperation.

23:11.491 --> 23:12.625
Thank you.

23:12.659 --> 23:13.626
The sooner Ella's
apprehended,

23:13.660 --> 23:16.062
the sooner my legal team
can prepare her defense.

23:16.095 --> 23:20.467
Wow. There's no "There must be
some kind of mistake,"

23:20.500 --> 23:22.935
or "My daughter's
not capable of that?"

23:22.969 --> 23:24.203
Do you have children?

23:24.236 --> 23:25.004
Do you?

23:26.072 --> 23:27.474
I did some background.

23:27.507 --> 23:28.374
After your wife died,

23:28.407 --> 23:30.009
your daughter came
into a large inheritance

23:30.042 --> 23:31.210
and sued for emancipation.

23:31.243 --> 23:33.045
Ella went through a great deal
after her mother's death,

23:33.079 --> 23:34.681
- and she lashed out at me.
- Yeah, and you lashed back

23:34.714 --> 23:36.449
with a team full of lawyers

23:36.483 --> 23:38.050
and put her back inside her
glass jar.

23:38.084 --> 23:39.919
She was a 16-year-old girl,
emotionally overwrought,

23:39.952 --> 23:41.921
and I was not going
to let her ruin her life.

23:41.954 --> 23:44.591
No, you were just going to hold
her hostage instead.

23:44.624 --> 23:47.560
It is a small wonder she is
identifying with her kidnappers.

23:47.594 --> 23:48.995
It's probably the only love
she's ever known.

23:49.028 --> 23:50.162
All right, all right.

23:57.970 --> 23:59.572
CHARLIE:
Hey.

23:59.606 --> 24:01.708
Hey.
How goes the decoder?

24:01.741 --> 24:04.176
Who knew tracing
a phone number

24:04.210 --> 24:06.646
could do so much damage
to a manicure?

24:09.782 --> 24:11.083
What?

24:11.117 --> 24:13.553
Is it wrong to get turned on
at the sight of you

24:13.586 --> 24:14.687
in goggles
and rubber gloves?

24:14.721 --> 24:16.022
Oh, damn it.

24:16.055 --> 24:18.024
- Whoa, you all right?
- Yeah.

24:18.057 --> 24:19.759
That's the third circuit
I've blown today.

24:19.792 --> 24:21.694
I've got a spare in my office.
I'll be back.

24:21.728 --> 24:23.730
Okay.
(knock at door)

24:23.763 --> 24:24.731
UPCHURCH:
Excuse me, Professor.

24:24.764 --> 24:25.665
Oh, hey.

24:25.698 --> 24:27.667
Is that a decoder?

24:27.700 --> 24:29.502
Yeah, this is it.

24:29.536 --> 24:31.504
Not exactly what I imagined
after reading some of your more

24:31.538 --> 24:34.106
ethereal musings on cake-cutting
theory, I've got to tell you.

24:34.140 --> 24:37.209
Well, sometimes cake
is a series of algorithms

24:37.243 --> 24:39.078
that help formulate
an analysis.

24:39.111 --> 24:40.880
And other times,
cake is just cake.

24:40.913 --> 24:41.881
(chuckles)

24:41.914 --> 24:43.716
Listen, I wanted to spitball
something at you

24:43.750 --> 24:45.785
- about that tabu search.
- It's funny you mention that

24:45.818 --> 24:47.219
because I've been giving
it some thought.

24:47.253 --> 24:49.255
It's quite possible that
the PNA's tactical shift

24:49.288 --> 24:50.422
might actually help us.

24:50.456 --> 24:52.692
Hitting the house makes
no tactical sense whatsoever.

24:52.725 --> 24:55.962
- I agree.
- It's like your hikers just...

24:55.995 --> 24:58.030
It's like they decided
to chase after a butterfly.

24:58.064 --> 25:00.232
You know what?

25:00.266 --> 25:02.969
That's a great analogy.

25:03.002 --> 25:04.203
Because once the hikers
veer off,

25:04.236 --> 25:06.005
chasing after that butterfly,

25:06.038 --> 25:08.541
they reveal
the butterfly's path

25:08.575 --> 25:10.309
with the evidence that
they leave in their wake--

25:10.342 --> 25:12.679
with footprints
and with broken branches.

25:12.712 --> 25:15.782
That evidence allows me
to analyze their tactics

25:15.815 --> 25:18.217
using decision analysis.

25:18.250 --> 25:19.285
Figure out which butterfly
they're chasing.

25:22.889 --> 25:24.924
Steffen Cavani.

25:24.957 --> 25:27.560
He went to high school with
Ella Pierce and Harper Simms.

25:27.594 --> 25:29.161
Gets expelled from Berkeley

25:29.195 --> 25:31.263
after a semester
for disruptive behavior,

25:31.297 --> 25:32.464
then falls
straight off the grid.

25:32.498 --> 25:34.901
The techs finally cracked
Ella Pierce's e-mail account.

25:34.934 --> 25:36.268
Turns out her and Cavani

25:36.302 --> 25:38.037
have been going back and
forth for nearly a year.

25:38.070 --> 25:40.039
You have to listen
to this stuff.

25:40.072 --> 25:41.574
LIZ: "Can't believe
you're the same guy

25:41.608 --> 25:42.942
in Moscowitz' history class.

25:42.975 --> 25:44.577
"If I'd known the real you,

25:44.611 --> 25:46.345
I would've jumped you
a long time ago."

25:46.378 --> 25:48.681
Lots more where that came from,
all in the same vein.

25:48.715 --> 25:50.950
All right, so, what, she hooks
up with the loser guy

25:50.983 --> 25:52.652
and hides it from Harper.

25:52.685 --> 25:55.688
He starts working on her poor
little rich girl complex,

25:55.722 --> 25:57.990
makes her feel guilty
about Daddy's sweatshops.

25:58.024 --> 25:59.358
Sounds like Megan's department.

25:59.391 --> 26:01.293
Yeah, well, Megan's on a little
bit of a time out, so...

26:01.327 --> 26:02.929
Again?

26:02.962 --> 26:04.664
What about the dead shooter?

26:04.697 --> 26:06.899
Reggie Woods, 25.

26:06.933 --> 26:08.968
String of arrests for disorderly
conduct, mostly related to

26:09.001 --> 26:11.771
antiglobalization rallies
in Seattle.

26:11.804 --> 26:15.374
Reggie was busted in Glendale
2006 for defacing a police car.

26:15.407 --> 26:18.177
His partner in crime
was Lucas Cavani,

26:18.210 --> 26:20.112
who purely coincidentally
happens to be Steffen's cousin.

26:20.146 --> 26:23.282
We've got a call
into his parole officer.

26:25.952 --> 26:27.954
Delivery van.

26:27.987 --> 26:30.322
You still purging the office?

26:30.356 --> 26:32.692
I'm trying to find
suitable homes

26:32.725 --> 26:35.061
for the material shards
of my past

26:35.094 --> 26:36.763
that no longer inform
my present.

26:36.796 --> 26:39.732
Now, it seemed to me
you had an affection

26:39.766 --> 26:42.134
Respighi's Ancient Airs
and Dances.

26:42.168 --> 26:43.302
Oh, thank you.

26:45.938 --> 26:48.641
Still no respite
from the case?

26:48.675 --> 26:51.410
Oh, Ella Pierce was kicked out
of boarding schools

26:51.443 --> 26:53.179
from New York to Lausanne.

26:53.212 --> 26:55.414
I got DUIs, stint in rehab.

26:55.447 --> 26:58.751
It's like a textbook example
of trying to draw love

26:58.785 --> 27:01.654
from her father
through negative attention.

27:01.688 --> 27:05.024
Unless I'm just seeing
too much of myself in the case.

27:05.057 --> 27:07.794
As your friend, I would not
presume to speculate,

27:07.827 --> 27:10.296
particularly given our last
exchange on the matter.

27:10.329 --> 27:12.331
Oh, Larry, I'm...
I'm really sorry about that.

27:12.364 --> 27:14.767
I had no right
to snap at you.

27:14.801 --> 27:17.036
I mean, maybe you could just
not be my friend for a minute

27:17.069 --> 27:18.337
and tell me the truth.

27:18.370 --> 27:20.673
Mm...

27:20.707 --> 27:23.375
You know, I've always been
cautious in addressing

27:23.409 --> 27:24.811
the issues you have
with your father.

27:24.844 --> 27:27.947
Well, I know
there's profound pain there.

27:29.048 --> 27:31.450
But having said that,

27:31.483 --> 27:35.454
it is surprising to me that
humanity was able to arrive

27:35.487 --> 27:38.691
so quickly at a correct model
of the solar system.

27:38.725 --> 27:41.060
There's this
driving tendency

27:41.093 --> 27:44.697
to orient the universe
in rotation around...

27:44.731 --> 27:47.967
well, our own little world.

27:49.468 --> 27:51.037
Thanks for the Respighi.

27:53.873 --> 27:55.407
(loud music playing,
pounding on door)

27:55.441 --> 27:57.043
DAVID:
Lucas, FBI!

27:57.076 --> 27:58.410
Open up!

27:58.444 --> 27:59.846
Yeah, nice try, Frank.

27:59.879 --> 28:01.180
I'll have your rent tomorrow.

28:01.213 --> 28:02.281
(yells)

28:02.314 --> 28:03.282
Get up against the wall!

28:03.315 --> 28:05.084
I want to see your hands!
Against the wall!

28:05.117 --> 28:06.385
- I didn't do anything.
- Hey!

28:06.418 --> 28:08.287
Reggie Woods is dead.

28:08.320 --> 28:09.555
What?

28:09.588 --> 28:11.423
He made a mistake of pointing
a gun in my general direction.

28:11.457 --> 28:13.893
Your cousin happened to be
standing right next to him.

28:13.926 --> 28:14.660
(turns off music)
- Steffen?

28:14.693 --> 28:16.896
- Yeah.
- Oh, man, that idiot.

28:16.929 --> 28:18.831
He hasn't been right since he
got involved with that bitch.

28:18.865 --> 28:20.466
Ella Pierce?

28:20.499 --> 28:21.901
Yeah, I guess you never
get over the one

28:21.934 --> 28:23.269
who wouldn't talk to you
in high school.

28:23.302 --> 28:25.471
I'm all for fighting
the power,

28:25.504 --> 28:28.374
but she talked scary
way above my tolerance.

28:28.407 --> 28:29.341
That's why I got some distance.

28:29.375 --> 28:30.209
You can check,
whatever you want to check.

28:30.242 --> 28:32.211
I don't run with those guys
anymore.

28:32.244 --> 28:33.445
Yeah, so where do they run?

28:33.479 --> 28:35.782
Reggie told me they had a squat
in East LA,

28:35.815 --> 28:37.116
near the freeway.

28:37.149 --> 28:39.518
That was a few months
ago, though.

28:39.551 --> 28:41.821
While you're out there
fighting the power,

28:41.854 --> 28:44.390
try recycling.

28:44.423 --> 28:48.194
Something Larry said
got me thinking

28:48.227 --> 28:48.995
about a misspent youth.

28:49.028 --> 28:51.497
You and Larry
warming up again?

28:51.530 --> 28:54.066
I think we're making our way
off the back burner.

28:54.100 --> 28:55.501
- Hmm.
- How are you and Don?

28:55.534 --> 28:56.936
How's that been going?

28:56.969 --> 28:58.070
Trying not to get burned.

28:58.104 --> 28:59.205
(laughs)

28:59.238 --> 29:00.306
It's a challenge.

29:00.339 --> 29:02.441
I think you should get
hazard pay for even trying.

29:02.474 --> 29:05.144
Speaking of, I got
a seduction going on here

29:05.177 --> 29:08.180
in these e-mails, only Ella
seems to be the aggressor.

29:08.214 --> 29:10.449
She flatters Santee,

29:10.482 --> 29:13.786
she speaks to his political
convictions, he mostly

29:13.820 --> 29:15.254
agrees with her.

29:15.287 --> 29:16.789
He begs her for sex.

29:16.823 --> 29:18.557
Certain words jumped out.

29:18.590 --> 29:19.691
(chuckles)

29:19.725 --> 29:21.861
How the hell would he even
get near a girl like this?

29:21.894 --> 29:25.497
She's famous, she's insulated
by money and privilege,

29:25.531 --> 29:28.134
and he barely registers
outside of the Web site.

29:28.167 --> 29:30.136
It's a lot easier
for the "it" girl

29:30.169 --> 29:31.971
to reach out to
the class burnout.

29:32.004 --> 29:33.572
Which is also
the perfect instrument

29:33.605 --> 29:35.141
to lash out at her father.

29:36.475 --> 29:39.345
Oh, God.

29:39.378 --> 29:41.480
Ella must have planned
this whole thing.

29:43.282 --> 29:45.284
CHARLIE:
So I used decision analysis

29:45.317 --> 29:47.586
to reset the parameters
of my predictive model.

29:47.619 --> 29:51.190
I factored in the impulse motive
of the PNA.

29:51.223 --> 29:52.324
Find our butterfly?

29:52.358 --> 29:55.127
Yeah, my analysis keeps
pointing back to Warren Pierce.

29:55.161 --> 29:57.563
So why did they hit
Harper Simms' house?

29:57.596 --> 30:00.199
It seems to predicate
on opportunity and familiarity.

30:00.232 --> 30:01.600
Look, they're
attacking locations

30:01.633 --> 30:03.836
that Ella Pierce can facilitate.

30:03.870 --> 30:05.071
So what's the
next inside job?

30:05.104 --> 30:06.305
I can answer that.

30:06.338 --> 30:08.474
Intel says this posted
in the last ten minutes.

30:08.507 --> 30:10.476
I have seen the harm and wrong

30:10.509 --> 30:12.945
my business practices
have caused

30:12.979 --> 30:15.314
to the great working peoples
of the world.

30:15.347 --> 30:17.149
I call on my board of directors

30:17.183 --> 30:19.085
to immediately dismantle
my factories,

30:19.118 --> 30:23.956
for my bank to dissolve
all of my assets immediately.

30:23.990 --> 30:25.291
Warren Pierce Industries
has 24 hours

30:25.324 --> 30:26.893
to show us
their sincerity.

30:26.926 --> 30:28.460
In the great struggle
for world justice,

30:28.494 --> 30:31.430
my father will no longer receive
preferential treatment.

30:38.370 --> 30:40.039
PIERCE:
I'm instructing my board

30:40.072 --> 30:43.542
to divest all interests
in Asia and Latin America

30:43.575 --> 30:46.278
and donate the proceeds
to relief agencies.

30:46.312 --> 30:48.114
As of tomorrow,

30:48.147 --> 30:50.116
Warren Pierce Industries
will cease to exist.

30:50.149 --> 30:51.583
I don't understand.

30:51.617 --> 30:53.419
I thought we had eyes
on the guy.

30:53.452 --> 30:54.653
We did, but we pulled them all

30:54.686 --> 30:55.988
when this stopped being a
kidnapping.

30:56.022 --> 30:57.289
And he has his own security.

30:57.323 --> 30:59.058
- Well, where were they?
LIZ: He's buying time.

30:59.091 --> 31:01.961
The board will never go along
with dissolving his company.

31:01.994 --> 31:03.162
Yeah, but he's out of time.

31:03.195 --> 31:05.097
His refusal to pay the ransom
pushed her over the edge.

31:05.131 --> 31:07.066
Daddy didn't play with her
her whole life.

31:07.099 --> 31:08.267
If he doesn't play
with her now...

31:08.300 --> 31:10.202
There's only one way this
is going to end up for Pierce.

31:12.972 --> 31:14.173
How's it going, guys?

31:14.206 --> 31:15.541
CHARLIE: Good, good. We're
almost there.

31:15.574 --> 31:16.475
We've intercepted
the PNA's upload

31:16.508 --> 31:18.978
of Pierce's communique
to their Web site,

31:19.011 --> 31:20.379
and she's running it
through the decoder.

31:20.412 --> 31:21.347
I isolated the CDMA code,

31:21.380 --> 31:23.582
and separated the information
on the MPEG.

31:23.615 --> 31:25.918
And this is gonna
lead us to where

31:25.952 --> 31:27.619
the signal was
transmitted from, right?

31:27.653 --> 31:30.122
Mm-hmm. Provided we don't blow
another circuit.

31:30.156 --> 31:32.925
Okay, I got a lock
on the phone number...

31:32.959 --> 31:34.026
(trilling)

31:34.060 --> 31:35.995
North 34 degrees,
38 minutes,

31:36.028 --> 31:38.931
west 118 degrees,
14 minutes.

31:38.965 --> 31:39.999
DAVID:
That's East L.A.

31:40.032 --> 31:42.634
Lucas said they were squatting
near the freeway.

31:42.668 --> 31:44.370
AMITA:
Ah, there it is.

31:44.403 --> 31:45.704
Knocking on the door
from 300 miles above Earth.

31:45.737 --> 31:47.039
We're about to knock
a lot harder.

32:04.023 --> 32:05.524
(beeping)

32:21.107 --> 32:22.941
David, talk to me--
you got a visual?

32:24.410 --> 32:25.711
I have Pierce.

32:30.282 --> 32:33.352
Confirming five bad guys:
three men, two women,

32:33.385 --> 32:34.753
including Ella Pierce.

32:34.786 --> 32:36.555
Liz?

32:36.588 --> 32:39.025
Locked and loaded--
we're in position.

32:39.058 --> 32:39.725
Hey.

32:39.758 --> 32:41.293
I've got the Web cam set up,

32:41.327 --> 32:42.728
and I'm hacking into
the PNA Web site.

32:42.761 --> 32:43.962
All right, good.

32:43.996 --> 32:47.066
Now, listen, Megan, you know,
if this girl is in your head...

32:47.099 --> 32:50.336
She is-- that's why
I'm the best person for the job.

32:58.444 --> 33:00.746
- Any word?
GINA: Nothing.

33:00.779 --> 33:03.015
Looks like the old man's
been lying to us,

33:03.049 --> 33:04.316
trying to save his ass.

33:04.350 --> 33:05.984
Time's running out, dude.

33:07.419 --> 33:09.455
Ella, we gotta
do something.

33:09.488 --> 33:10.722
Show him we're not
messing around.

33:10.756 --> 33:12.691
Maybe if we start
sending him back in pieces.

33:12.724 --> 33:15.527
Why are you doing this?

33:15.561 --> 33:18.697
It's what Pierces do--
taking control of your life,

33:18.730 --> 33:20.332
telling you what to do
with your money.

33:22.368 --> 33:23.569
We're in.

33:23.602 --> 33:24.136
(over speaker):
Steffen...

33:24.170 --> 33:25.537
MEGAN:
Steffen Cavani,

33:25.571 --> 33:28.207
this is Agent Megan Reeves
from the FBI.

33:28.240 --> 33:29.741
We have the house surrounded.

33:40.086 --> 33:41.587
Take the perimeter!

33:44.423 --> 33:45.491
I got nothing to say.

33:45.524 --> 33:47.393
You're gonna
have to let Piece go.

33:47.426 --> 33:49.561
STEFFEN: Why, so you can
blow us all away?

33:49.595 --> 33:51.297
So maybe
you're not going to spend

33:51.330 --> 33:53.065
the rest of your life
behind bars.

33:53.099 --> 33:55.734
Steffen, I know this whole thing
wasn't your idea.

33:55.767 --> 33:57.803
I know Ella
roped you into it.

33:57.836 --> 33:59.438
What are you
talking about?

33:59.471 --> 34:00.539
MEGAN:
She's the heiress

34:00.572 --> 34:02.841
to a multibillion-dollar empire,
Steffen.

34:02.874 --> 34:04.710
Don't you think
she could've just

34:04.743 --> 34:08.314
written a $40-million check
to a relief agency?

34:08.347 --> 34:10.616
Do you really think she
cares about sweatshops?

34:10.649 --> 34:13.719
They paid for her Maserati.

34:13.752 --> 34:14.753
She's trying to divide us.

34:14.786 --> 34:16.822
MEGAN: Steffen, the only thing
she cares about

34:16.855 --> 34:18.090
is hurting her father.

34:18.124 --> 34:19.491
You're just the ride
to the prom.

34:19.525 --> 34:21.093
She's got other plans
for the night.

34:23.195 --> 34:24.663
No more talk!

34:24.696 --> 34:26.565
(static crackles)
I think I lost them.

34:26.598 --> 34:27.733
Ella, what are you doing?

34:32.171 --> 34:33.639
All right, we fire over their
heads, fire over their heads!

34:33.672 --> 34:34.873
I want them walking out of here!

34:34.906 --> 34:36.275
Roger that.

34:47.719 --> 34:48.720
(bullets ricocheting,
pinging)

35:00.566 --> 35:02.201
David, talk to me.

35:02.234 --> 35:05.237
No target acquisition, Don--
they're too dug in.

35:10.276 --> 35:11.677
Not all of 'em.

35:17.483 --> 35:18.750
Two boys, two girls left.

35:18.784 --> 35:19.918
PIERCE:
Ella!

35:19.951 --> 35:21.853
They're going to kill you!

35:21.887 --> 35:23.222
Who cares?

35:23.255 --> 35:24.223
You already killed me,

35:24.256 --> 35:25.357
just like you killed Mom.

35:27.959 --> 35:29.027
She didn't die
from the cancer,

35:29.060 --> 35:32.198
she just didn't want to live
in that house anymore!

35:32.231 --> 35:34.900
You know that's not true!

35:34.933 --> 35:37.503
Your mother wanted to live!

35:37.536 --> 35:39.605
I promised her
I would take care of you!

35:39.638 --> 35:40.806
By trapping me in your world?

35:40.839 --> 35:41.640
Honey, please!

35:41.673 --> 35:43.809
You turned me
into a tabloid princess,

35:43.842 --> 35:45.911
a punchline on David Letterman,

35:45.944 --> 35:48.714
all so you could sell
some damn clothes!

35:48.747 --> 35:50.182
Well, now you're in my headline.

35:50.216 --> 35:51.149
Please!

35:53.719 --> 35:56.588
If this escalates, we scare
them into shooting Pierce.

35:56.622 --> 35:58.657
All right, let's go--
tear gas 'em, tear gas 'em!

36:06.932 --> 36:08.734
They're not gonna
let us out of here!

36:08.767 --> 36:10.636
Do not punk out
on me now, Steffan.

36:10.669 --> 36:12.604
I have had enough
of people making promises

36:12.638 --> 36:13.505
they won't keep.

36:14.706 --> 36:19.278
(gas hissing)

36:19.311 --> 36:20.346
Let's go, let's go,
let's go.

36:21.913 --> 36:23.382
(coughing)

36:33.825 --> 36:36.495
(coughing, gas hissing)

36:37.963 --> 36:38.897
I got two coming out.

36:41.267 --> 36:42.901
Come here! Come here.

36:42.934 --> 36:44.903
(coughing)

36:44.936 --> 36:47.473
All right, we got 'em.
we got 'em, we got 'em.

36:47.506 --> 36:49.741
The rest of you inside,
you have 15 seconds

36:49.775 --> 36:51.977
to come out with
your hands up in the air.

36:52.010 --> 36:53.245
It's over.

36:53.279 --> 36:55.247
(coughing)

36:55.281 --> 36:55.947
Don't do it, Steffan!

36:57.883 --> 36:59.851
I'm bringing out Pierce!
Don't shoot!

36:59.885 --> 37:01.853
You're not leaving me!

37:08.894 --> 37:10.329
I don't see Ella.

37:10.362 --> 37:11.430
Shots fired!
Shots fired!

37:12.498 --> 37:14.333
David...?

37:14.366 --> 37:16.502
No, there's too much smoke.

37:26.712 --> 37:28.480
In the arm?

37:28.514 --> 37:30.449
What kind of cowboy is that?

37:30.482 --> 37:31.450
Not a cowboy.

37:31.483 --> 37:33.619
Just a field agent.

37:36.588 --> 37:37.723
(sniffs)

37:37.756 --> 37:39.057
Don't say anything.

37:39.090 --> 37:40.058
Don't say
anything, honey.

37:40.091 --> 37:41.360
I have the best lawyers!

37:41.393 --> 37:43.429
I love you, too, Dad.

37:55.607 --> 37:57.709
TV ANNOUNCER: ...he sees
Samsonov, past the blue line.

37:57.743 --> 38:00.612
Samsonov's breaking away, he
shoots, and scores!

38:03.815 --> 38:04.983
Hey.

38:05.016 --> 38:05.884
(mutes TV)

38:05.917 --> 38:06.885
Hey.

38:06.918 --> 38:08.854
So it got pretty hairy
out there today, huh?

38:10.121 --> 38:11.757
(sighs)

38:11.790 --> 38:13.992
Yeah, well...

38:14.025 --> 38:16.027
Loquacious, as always.

38:18.797 --> 38:20.599
You want to order some food?

38:24.603 --> 38:26.004
What are we doing?

38:26.037 --> 38:27.906
Tonight?

38:29.375 --> 38:31.343
(heavy sigh)

38:31.377 --> 38:33.011
Look, the last few days,
we've tried to talk,

38:33.044 --> 38:38.083
and, you know,
now I just... I feel tired.

38:38.116 --> 38:43.789
I think we just keep
coming back out of habit...

38:43.822 --> 38:47.426
you know?

38:47.459 --> 38:51.129
I don't want to feel like
we led each other on.

38:51.162 --> 38:54.366
I mean, you deserve
so much more than that

38:54.400 --> 38:56.702
and I just keep
screwing these things up.

39:06.412 --> 39:07.479
See you tomorrow, boss.

39:15.687 --> 39:16.054
(door shuts)

39:18.123 --> 39:22.160
You managed to bring
the monastery with you.

39:22.193 --> 39:24.129
It's calming.

39:24.162 --> 39:28.033
Well, feel free to find your
center here, anytime you wish.

39:28.066 --> 39:29.468
Every time I think
I'm over my father

39:29.501 --> 39:32.137
or my childhood, I...

39:32.170 --> 39:33.071
(groans)

39:33.104 --> 39:35.974
I think I let this case
take me for a ride.

39:36.007 --> 39:38.610
Struggle is not
altogether a bad thing.

39:38.644 --> 39:40.479
The charged particles
of the solar wind

39:40.512 --> 39:42.481
require heat and combustion

39:42.514 --> 39:45.050
to escape the gravitational
pull of the sun.

39:45.083 --> 39:48.620
From tumult comes freedom.

39:48.654 --> 39:50.155
(wry laugh)

39:50.188 --> 39:51.890
You have this
great way of

39:51.923 --> 39:55.093
making my neuroses
sound cosmic.

39:56.928 --> 40:01.132
My center is back east, so
I'm gonna go visit my dad.

40:01.166 --> 40:03.602
I already booked
the airplane ticket,

40:03.635 --> 40:06.772
it's nonrefundable...

40:06.805 --> 40:08.406
You want to come with me?

40:10.676 --> 40:11.677
(laughing):
Oh, really?

40:11.710 --> 40:14.513
Um... are you serious?

40:14.546 --> 40:16.582
I don't know, it just
sort of came out.

40:16.615 --> 40:19.485
I guess not.

40:19.518 --> 40:20.686
This is very odd,

40:20.719 --> 40:23.221
because for some time now,
my wanderlust has stoked in me

40:23.254 --> 40:27.225
this deep inner urge
to visit New York.

40:27.258 --> 40:29.461
I would have
to talk to Brother Theo.

40:29.495 --> 40:30.796
While he's
in deep meditation,

40:30.829 --> 40:32.464
I've been made
custodian of his rabbit.

40:33.999 --> 40:36.134
Lucky rabbit.

40:39.104 --> 40:41.172
(water gurgling, sputtering)
