Addressed to you,
lovers of liberty.

00:10.336 --> 00:13.337
The first gift --
hollis doyle.

throwing his hat into the ring.

Saddle up, little doggie.

The second gift?

00:21.246 --> 00:22.813
Well, yours truly has agreed

00:22.815 --> 00:24.915
To host
the first republican debate --

00:24.917 --> 00:27.451
A duty I take very seriously,

00:27.453 --> 00:29.019
For debates mean setting aside

00:29.021 --> 00:30.821
Petty infighting
between the candidates

00:30.823 --> 00:32.289
And putting the lofty concerns

Of the voters and the republic
above all.

00:35.961 --> 00:37.260
You really think
it's okay for your network

super pac to advertise

by hollis doyle industries."

Fine by me.

01:00.953 --> 01:02.352
My candidate's
vertically challenged.

She needs a box to stand on.

01:03.389 --> 01:04.721
And risk losing
that shorty vote?

01:04.723 --> 01:06.123
She can't use a box
if the podium is clear.

01:06.125 --> 01:07.491
That's all

01:07.493 --> 01:08.825

The purpose
of this whole endeavor

Is for the voters
to get a good, clear look

At all the candidates.

You have a problem
with our polling?

Your samples are tiny.
Your questions are vague.

01:29.181 --> 01:31.581
Frankly, your polling sucks.
She is right.

01:31.583 --> 01:33.050
It isn't reliable enough
to determine a front-runner.

01:33.052 --> 01:34.551
The stakes of who's at
the center podium are too high.

01:34.553 --> 01:38.188
We stand by our poll.
This point is not negotiable.

01:38.190 --> 01:40.590
We want a red light
indicating when time is up --

from tumbling from these jaws?

No light.
No buzzer.

Whoa! That's some sore losin'
right there.

and hollis are friends.

no blinking light,

mr. Doyle --

03:03.942 --> 03:05.809
That's not
an immigration policy,

03:05.811 --> 03:07.344
It's institutionalized
racism.

Now, hold on a minute.
If we close our borders --

03:09.348 --> 03:12.983
Do you have any idea how much
of our economy depends

03:12.985 --> 03:15.252
On the ideas and contributions
of non-citizens?

03:15.254 --> 03:17.254
The best young minds
in the world,

03:17.256 --> 03:19.823
They come here,
they enroll in our universities,

03:19.825 --> 03:21.591
And once they graduate,
they stay.

03:21.593 --> 03:23.693
And we want them to stay.

03:23.695 --> 03:27.030
They become our engineers,
our doctors, our scientists.

Immigration isn't a curse,

to staying competitive.

out of the park.

I can also tell you
that if we keep the gas tax

At the absurdly low rate
of 18 cents a gallon,

Let me
ask you something.

24:34.532 --> 24:36.965
Back during
the impeachment hearings,

24:36.967 --> 24:38.901
When the public
was asking for your head --

24:38.903 --> 24:42.404
Who came to your rescue
and sang your praises
on national television?

24:42.406 --> 24:43.405
Edison.

24:43.407 --> 24:44.706
Whose engagement ring
did you return

24:44.708 --> 24:47.075
Because he was the head
of the senate intel committee

24:47.077 --> 24:48.777
And your father
felt threatened by him?

24:48.779 --> 24:50.279
This isn't the speech
I was asking for.

24:50.281 --> 24:54.049
This man has been
nothing but nice to you.

24:54.051 --> 24:56.251
[ sighs ]
I get that, but I --

24:56.253 --> 24:58.220
But what?

24:58.222 --> 25:01.557
You've played dirty before?
Poisoned a few arrows?

25:01.559 --> 25:04.960
Of course you have.

25:04.962 --> 25:06.562
But that was always at the
expense of someone you loathed.

25:06.564 --> 25:09.131
You were robin hood,

25:09.133 --> 25:10.666
Stealing from the rich
and giving to the poor.

25:10.668 --> 25:11.733
This would be different.

25:11.735 --> 25:14.002
This would be hurting
someone you respect,

25:14.004 --> 25:15.170
Someone
who is innocent,

25:15.172 --> 25:18.740
Someone who has never
done anything to harm you.

25:18.742 --> 25:22.845
You'd no longer be robin hood,
olivia, you'd be --

25:22.847 --> 25:24.246

25:29.486 --> 25:33.322
The reason
mellie grant imploded today

25:33.324 --> 25:36.492
Is because you were trying to
make her something she wasn't.

25:38.495 --> 25:40.496
I'd hate to see you make
the same mistake with yourself.

25:55.144 --> 25:56.478
Finally,
after running into him again,

25:56.480 --> 25:57.813
He asked me out,
and here we are.

25:57.815 --> 25:59.348
Wow.
That happened so fast?

25:59.350 --> 26:01.216
Yeah. I don't know
if I believe in fate,

26:01.218 --> 26:03.051
But if it wasn't fate,
it was pretty darn close.

26:03.053 --> 26:04.820

I envy that.

26:04.822 --> 26:08.056

I can tell you, he definitely
knows all my secrets.

26:12.129 --> 26:14.830

to marrying the head of the nsa.
