Not from here,
european design?

00:41.038 --> 00:42.831
Sure is pretty.

00:42.873 --> 00:44.624
Too pretty.

00:51.714 --> 00:53.883
Big mistake.

01:35.838 --> 01:38.173
Dude.

01:39.758 --> 01:44.137
You scratch my paint,
I scratch yours.

<i> transcript: f1nc0  </i>

02:47.529 --> 02:49.322
Hey, cherry moped.

02:50.490 --> 02:52.408
This moped has dual carbs ...

02:52.450 --> 02:55.411
and goes 0-60 mph in 3.5 seconds.

03:05.920 --> 03:09.799
Jack, a ladie's vital stats
are her own bussines.

03:13.260 --> 03:14.595
Hey, Nick, right?

03:14.637 --> 03:18.640
- Actually, it's Jack.
- Jack, sorry.

03:18.682 --> 03:21.184
- I'm Sierra.
- I know.

03:21.810 --> 03:25.063
You once offered to take me
for a ride?

03:26.022 --> 03:29.442
Of course, I did.
At anytime.

03:29.484 --> 03:32.778
<i>I'm your guardian, kiddo,
not your wingman.</i>

03:32.987 --> 03:35.364
So, how about now?

03:40.577 --> 03:42.079
Hey hey, small world ...

03:42.579 --> 03:46.750
- I'm having a conversation...
- Cheer captain here ...

03:46.750 --> 03:50.169
might into a watching you
on four wheels of muscle car.

03:50.211 --> 03:52.838
Are you challenging me?
To a race?

03:52.880 --> 03:55.758
You catch on quick, punch,
what do you say?

04:07.685 --> 04:10.104
- You didn't give me chance to answer.
- Nope.

04:10.146 --> 04:12.648
- Arcee, we can smoke him.
- Yep.

04:13.816 --> 04:16.777
- You just don't get it.
- I don't make the rules, Jack ...

04:16.819 --> 04:20.029
Optimus does. A rule number One,
in case you missed it ...

04:20.072 --> 04:23.116
Never abuse power
for personal gain.

04:23.158 --> 04:25.076
That includes horsepower.

04:29.539 --> 04:32.959
Vince, maybe the racing
isn't such a good idea.

04:33.417 --> 04:34.668
Ha, I figured!

04:34.710 --> 04:37.212
You bike around here, like your bike
is something special ...

04:37.254 --> 04:39.673
but it's just
a chunky-clunky trash...

04:40.132 --> 04:41.925
and ugly.

04:47.388 --> 04:49.932
That's it,
the yahoo is going down!

04:55.187 --> 04:56.939
What happened
with rule number one?

04:56.981 --> 05:00.108
Get bent, just this once.

05:02.402 --> 05:03.820
Hey, girls.

05:04.279 --> 05:08.908
- Your pal Darby, he is ...
- Ready when you are, Vinnie.

05:09.867 --> 05:12.078
Dirt road by trucker's ranch.

05:12.119 --> 05:13.663
One hour.

05:20.836 --> 05:24.130
From here, to the next mile marker.
Ready, go!

05:28.301 --> 05:30.136
Like that was fair...

05:37.518 --> 05:39.728
- Arcee?
- Winning is not enough, Jack.

05:39.770 --> 05:41.813
You wanna make him cry.

05:59.705 --> 06:01.290
Outstanding!

06:01.998 --> 06:05.418
Now it might be a good time to offer
Sierra quick once around the block?

06:05.460 --> 06:07.837
Don't push it.

06:17.346 --> 06:18.931
Ah, Breakdown ...

06:18.972 --> 06:22.934
has there be any change in
Megatron's condition?

06:24.060 --> 06:27.981
- Only cosmetic.
- Well, I'm sure ..

06:27.981 --> 06:31.651
that you and the doctor
have been doing everything in your power.

06:31.651 --> 06:33.361
Where is Knockout?

06:36.405 --> 06:39.616
Could you believe, what some skin job
they did to me?

06:40.534 --> 06:44.621
You've been streetracing
among the humans again, haven't you?

06:45.121 --> 06:46.664
I'm not only an automobile ...

06:46.664 --> 06:49.000
I'm an automobile enthusiast.

06:49.042 --> 06:53.004
I do strived run a tight shift, Knockout.

06:53.045 --> 06:57.257
I would strongly suggested
you seek my permission next time...

06:57.257 --> 07:01.345
you decide to disappear
on one of your little... jons.

07:01.720 --> 07:04.264
No worries, commander.

07:05.056 --> 07:07.725
It is lord, to you.

07:07.767 --> 07:10.812
Only if Megatron
takes a nose dive.

07:13.064 --> 07:16.025
The day our master
emerges from stasis ...

07:16.066 --> 07:19.069
I will graciously reliesh the title.

07:19.111 --> 07:22.114
But I believe that
outcome is unlikely...

07:22.155 --> 07:25.992
something to do with
the quality of medical care around here.

07:27.327 --> 07:29.162
So continue buffing...

07:29.162 --> 07:32.623
we do want Megatron looking
his best for the memorial.

07:36.126 --> 07:37.586
Buff this!

07:48.680 --> 07:50.640
Not a word to anyone.

07:50.681 --> 07:52.516
Our little secret.

07:56.186 --> 08:00.065
Dude! And the winner is ...

08:00.816 --> 08:03.777
- Miko, who told you?
- You kidding?

08:03.777 --> 08:05.487
It's all over school.

08:06.237 --> 08:08.906
You beat the pants
of that bully Vince.

08:10.491 --> 08:12.618
You guys have to keep
this on the D.L.

08:12.660 --> 08:14.787
Especially the Optimus.

08:20.167 --> 08:22.002
Hey!
I've been looking for you.

08:22.002 --> 08:23.920
The race, how grate was that...

08:23.920 --> 08:26.840
I was like ...
yeah, go Jack!

08:27.423 --> 08:30.927
- It was no big deal.
- You've got that right.

08:32.135 --> 08:34.513
If you think you can
run with the big boys ...

08:35.014 --> 08:38.851
the circuit,
tonight, 11:oo PM.

08:43.395 --> 08:45.148
You agreed to what?

08:46.107 --> 08:48.985
It was something like
a secret racing club.

08:49.027 --> 08:51.070
I don't know, I had no choice.

08:51.112 --> 08:54.365
- Sierra was standing right there.
- You always have a choice, Jack.

08:54.407 --> 08:57.534
And what part of "Just for once"
did you not understand?

08:57.534 --> 08:59.369
I know, I'm sorry.

08:59.369 --> 09:02.998
- But we're on, right?
- We're not on.

09:08.127 --> 09:11.756
<i>Knockout, Starscream has been
looking for you again.</i>

09:12.173 --> 09:15.092
- Where did you go?
- Out for a little drive.

09:15.134 --> 09:19.138
I just roll from town to town,
sniffing around until...

09:22.015 --> 09:25.143
the next opportunity
presents itself.

09:39.031 --> 09:39.990
Raf?

09:43.076 --> 09:44.160
Is there any way
I could borrow ...

09:44.160 --> 09:46.788
Bumblebee for an hour?

09:48.456 --> 09:51.709
Jack, you know
racing is against the rules.

09:51.751 --> 09:53.502
What if Optimus finds out?

09:55.880 --> 09:58.132
But Raf, he has to get the girl.

10:00.634 --> 10:02.719
And beat the bully?

10:03.595 --> 10:05.513
Well ..

10:05.889 --> 10:08.850
Come on, Raf, just this once?

10:25.657 --> 10:27.325
Bike is in the shop.

10:32.580 --> 10:35.040
<i> Circuit riders, are you ready? </i>

10:39.378 --> 10:41.630
<i> Play it hard, but keep it clean. </i>

10:41.672 --> 10:43.131
<i> Fire on the five ...</i>

10:43.173 --> 10:44.090
<i> four ...</i>

10:44.090 --> 10:45.175
<i> three ...</i>

10:45.258 --> 10:46.134
<i> two ...</i>

10:47.010 --> 10:48.720
<i> one! </i>

10:59.480 --> 11:02.315
The autobot they call Bumblebee.

11:08.988 --> 11:10.490
What was that Bee?

11:13.659 --> 11:15.703
Wait, I know that car.

11:40.642 --> 11:42.185
What a ... ?

11:50.693 --> 11:52.111
Can you lose him, Bee?

11:53.988 --> 11:55.322
What did you say?

11:56.907 --> 11:58.325
I hope that means "yes."

11:58.367 --> 12:00.911
Except I should call
base for backup.

12:07.625 --> 12:10.336
Has anyone seen Jack?

12:10.878 --> 12:14.048
Not since...
we last saw him.

12:15.257 --> 12:17.051
They're racing, aren't they?

12:17.092 --> 12:20.262
- Just this once.
- Did you know about this?

12:20.304 --> 12:24.099
No, maybe.
A little.

12:28.895 --> 12:31.147
You've been chased by Knockout?

12:32.690 --> 12:34.358
That sounds like a Decepticon.

12:34.358 --> 12:38.695
Bee, do not engage, your first
priority is to keep Jack safe.

12:38.737 --> 12:40.989
Until I get my hands into him.

12:55.628 --> 12:57.421
Slick.

13:23.862 --> 13:25.697
I think we lost him, Bee.

13:27.991 --> 13:30.076
Oh, you gonna be kidding me!

13:30.118 --> 13:31.452
Darby!

13:41.878 --> 13:43.713
Vince, you have to get out of here.

13:43.755 --> 13:45.423
You win, ok?
Congratulations.

13:45.465 --> 13:46.341
Now go!

13:46.925 --> 13:50.720
No, start to backup loser,
we're finishing this race.

13:50.762 --> 13:52.972
Don't want to take it
to the finish line?  Fine.

13:53.014 --> 13:56.308
Then we've got something
to settle right here, right now.

14:02.856 --> 14:05.025
What's going on?
What ...

14:23.416 --> 14:26.544
Breakdown, you never guess
what I'm packing.

14:26.586 --> 14:28.796
Bumblebee's human friend.

14:29.380 --> 14:32.675
And when the Autobot
attempts stage to rescue him ...

14:32.717 --> 14:35.553
<i>... he has a Breakdown.</i>

14:39.139 --> 14:41.058
Bee, he's getting away!

14:43.810 --> 14:45.895
I can't understand you.

14:45.937 --> 14:47.480
Look, I'm not Raf.

14:47.480 --> 14:52.026
Can you just honk ones for bad
and twice for good news?

14:58.991 --> 15:01.618
- Jack, we need a little chat.
- Later, Arcee.

15:01.660 --> 15:04.663
Vince got snatched by
that slick sportscar Con.

15:04.704 --> 15:07.123
What would Knockout do
with the random human?

15:07.165 --> 15:09.917
He probably mistood, that Vince
is Bumblebee's human friend.

15:09.917 --> 15:11.592
I'm not even
Bumblebee's human friend.

15:11.592 --> 15:14.547
I don't know, it doesn't matter, why he
took him?  Vince is in trouble.

15:14.588 --> 15:17.841
- Oh well, tough break for Vince.
- Bulkhead!

15:18.884 --> 15:20.719
What? I heard
that guy is a jerk.

15:20.761 --> 15:23.763
No argument there,
but the guy is also innocent.

15:23.805 --> 15:25.974
Vince doesn't deserves
to get crushed by Cons.

15:29.060 --> 15:29.977
Hop on.

15:31.771 --> 15:35.399
They should be back right now.
You think Bumblebee is ok?

15:35.441 --> 15:36.442
Don't worry, Raf ...

15:36.442 --> 15:39.361
Bulkhead would let anything
happened to Jack or Bee.

15:43.031 --> 15:45.325
We should just tell to Optimus the truth.

15:45.367 --> 15:46.785
Absolutely not!

15:46.785 --> 15:49.787
We made a deal.
Just act completely normally.

15:49.829 --> 15:51.539
Raf, Miko.

15:52.373 --> 15:55.209
Don't either of you know
where the others have gone?

15:55.918 --> 15:59.880
- Oh no, sir, we don't know.
- Miko is correct.

15:59.922 --> 16:02.632
- We do not know.
- Why would we know?

16:20.065 --> 16:21.858
Bumblebee brought company.

16:25.028 --> 16:27.739
On your guard boys, could be a trap.

16:27.780 --> 16:29.741
Remember, no shooting.

16:31.826 --> 16:34.453
Speaking of safety,
here is where you get off.

17:24.457 --> 17:26.084
Where is the two-wheeler?

17:28.695 --> 17:30.697
Hey!
Watch the paint!

17:46.128 --> 17:47.671
That's my girl.

17:53.301 --> 17:55.678
Breakdown,
in case you're looking for me ...

17:55.720 --> 17:57.847
things got messy, 
so I hit the road.

17:57.889 --> 18:00.391
One screap is enough for today.

18:21.243 --> 18:22.953
Eat my dust.

18:38.676 --> 18:41.303
<i>Optimus, Knockout has a hostage.</i>

18:41.345 --> 18:43.013
Understood.

18:56.484 --> 18:59.403
Do you know,
how hard that is to replace?

19:13.208 --> 19:15.877
Optimus, this was my fault.

19:16.753 --> 19:19.463
We must get this boy
to safety immediately.

19:20.006 --> 19:22.633
Explanations can come later.

19:22.675 --> 19:24.468
From all of you.

19:37.730 --> 19:39.857
How?
What happened?

19:40.274 --> 19:42.234
Some guys jumped on
you under the bridge ...

19:42.276 --> 19:44.194
and they tosed you 
into their trunk.

19:44.778 --> 19:47.447
- Must have been some kind of initiation.
- Really?

19:48.323 --> 19:52.077
Yeah, I found you
knocked out by side of the road.

19:57.248 --> 19:59.875
Look, I gotta be honest
after what I saw tonight ...

20:00.418 --> 20:02.920
I'm thinking, 
racing isn't my thing.

20:04.171 --> 20:05.589
I hear you, Darby.

20:05.589 --> 20:10.427
Hard to win a race driving a pedal car.

20:18.392 --> 20:21.145
Knockout, was I not clear?

20:21.187 --> 20:24.314
You had defined my orders yet again!

20:24.356 --> 20:27.943
My mistake, commander Starscream.
But I've learned my lesson.

20:28.568 --> 20:30.612
And paid the price.

20:30.654 --> 20:33.073
It's his LORD!

20:33.114 --> 20:37.410
And you have payed,
 when I say you have payed!

20:38.035 --> 20:44.208
Not worry, your punishment
shall be merely ... cosmetic.

20:44.249 --> 20:47.711
No, not the finish,
anything but not finish!

20:48.045 --> 20:50.964
Nooo!

20:54.551 --> 20:58.095
So Jack, do you have time
for that ride?

21:00.806 --> 21:04.018
I'm sorry, Sierra,
I can't right now.

21:05.227 --> 21:08.772
No problem.
I guess I'll just ... see you around.

21:14.235 --> 21:15.403
Hop on.

21:16.821 --> 21:19.824
- Wow, really?
- Just this once.
