WEBVTT

00:00.920 --> 00:02.909
And that's why you should elect me

00:02.910 --> 00:05.067
as your Second Grade President.

00:05.068 --> 00:06.949
Vote for some-bunny you can depend on.

00:11.366 --> 00:13.659
You know, that bunny-eared
freak really grates me.

00:13.660 --> 00:15.619
She's been president every
year since kindergarten.

00:15.620 --> 00:16.912
She's lost touch with the people.

00:16.913 --> 00:18.889
It's ridiculous... this whole election.

00:18.890 --> 00:20.059
Back in my day, it was

00:20.060 --> 00:22.129
"Heads down, hands up. Timmy wins.

00:22.130 --> 00:24.419
Uhp. There's the nuke
siren. Duck and cover."

00:24.420 --> 00:26.213
Okay, shut up, shut up. It's time.

00:26.214 --> 00:29.899
♪ La la la la la la la la la ♪

00:29.900 --> 00:32.970

- What up, Hilltop?

00:36.320 --> 00:37.709
I'm Rory Banks, here to announce

00:37.710 --> 00:39.269
my bid for Class President!

00:39.270 --> 00:42.300
Whoo!

00:42.355 --> 00:45.190
I will not rest until we eliminate math.

00:45.191 --> 00:47.777
I've said it before...
we all have calculators!

00:51.531 --> 00:52.659
I don't envy you.

00:52.660 --> 00:55.360
Elections are a total
time suck for parents.

00:55.390 --> 00:57.953
It's canvassing, cold-calling...

00:57.954 --> 01:00.969
all while the kids in China
are learning engineering

01:00.970 --> 01:02.899
and preparing to destroy us.

01:02.900 --> 01:04.479
- Anyway, have fun.
- Mm-hmm.

01:04.480 --> 01:07.450
Now, if any of you would like to
donate any of your lunch money

01:07.460 --> 01:09.539
or help pad out my circle of "yes men,"

01:09.540 --> 01:11.675
please speak to one of my running mates.

01:11.676 --> 01:12.979
Who wants a T-shirt?

01:14.820 --> 01:16.054
Ooh!

01:16.055 --> 01:18.219
See that? Those ladies are your ladies.

01:18.220 --> 01:19.550
Welcome to the ticket, fool.

01:26.190 --> 01:29.359
Do you have any red wine
that's even redder?

01:29.360 --> 01:31.945
Like, more the color of the
blood of The Sacred Ox?

01:31.946 --> 01:34.099
Okay, what's happening
here? Is this a cult thing?

01:34.100 --> 01:36.400
If it's a moon cult, I'm
in. I love moon stuff.

01:36.410 --> 01:39.000
No, it's just "Joust" night, baby!

01:39.010 --> 01:41.739
Ohh! That fantasy show with
the knights and dragons?

01:41.740 --> 01:43.240
- They are not dragons.
- They're not dragons.

01:43.640 --> 01:45.449
They're stegasuses.

01:45.450 --> 01:48.337
They're like a pegasus with
armor, like a stegosaurus.

01:48.338 --> 01:51.260
Okay. I'm sorry I... called them that.

01:51.270 --> 01:53.079
Angie and I are binge-watching
the first three seasons

01:53.080 --> 01:54.590
before the new one drops next week.

01:54.594 --> 01:57.119
Yeah, we've developed a nightly
ritual of watching, drinking,

01:57.120 --> 02:00.289
and speaking in an unspecific
pan-European dialect.

02:00.290 --> 02:02.392
It's a smith's barrel of fun!

02:02.393 --> 02:04.959
Are you guys sure watching a
show this hard is healthy?

02:04.960 --> 02:06.330
Because you remember what happened

02:06.340 --> 02:07.730
when people saw the finale of "Lost."

02:07.732 --> 02:09.024
I loved the "Lost" finale.

02:09.025 --> 02:10.399
Well, it's a lot healthier
than obsessing over

02:10.400 --> 02:11.480
my breakup with Owen.

02:11.486 --> 02:14.299
Yeah, Angie and I are kind
of nailing being single.

02:14.300 --> 02:15.959
Bingeing is the best way not to deal

02:15.960 --> 02:17.699
with my grand gesture
I made towards Tracy.

02:17.700 --> 02:19.409
It's been so weird since
I showed up at her house

02:19.410 --> 02:21.620
to ask her out and met
her boyfriend instead.

02:21.621 --> 02:23.159
Yeah. That was a big swing.

02:23.160 --> 02:24.619
Yeah, but there's something between us.

02:24.620 --> 02:27.793
All of our conversations are
charged with chemistry.

02:27.794 --> 02:30.319
This toaster's pretty slow.

02:30.320 --> 02:32.160
Not as slow as the last one.

02:32.730 --> 02:33.840
Huh.

02:33.841 --> 02:35.217
Is that the end of that story, or... ?

02:35.218 --> 02:37.429
There's no good way to convey chemistry

02:37.430 --> 02:38.439
through conversation, okay?

02:38.440 --> 02:40.800
But trust me, our vibe is electric.

02:40.807 --> 02:43.279
- Howdy.
- Miggy, what are you wearing?

02:43.280 --> 02:45.435
You look like you mugged a
mannequin at a golf shop.

02:45.436 --> 02:47.854
When you're dating Bobbi
Babsen, Golf Pro to the Stars,

02:47.855 --> 02:49.231
there's an image to keep up.

02:49.232 --> 02:51.239
So she's been putting me in new threads.

02:51.240 --> 02:53.840
Turns out being a kept
man is kinda dope.

02:53.850 --> 02:55.209
Well, we don't need love.

02:55.210 --> 02:56.449
We have the whole "Joust" universe

02:56.450 --> 02:59.116
of the stegasus, the
Guardians of Corynne Wood,

02:59.117 --> 03:01.701
and The Grand Priestess
of Lazarian's Mount.

03:01.702 --> 03:03.619
I love that theme song.

03:03.620 --> 03:05.205
♪ Joust! Joust! Joust! ♪

03:05.206 --> 03:06.329
- ♪ Joust! Joust! ♪
- Oh, I can do that!

03:06.330 --> 03:08.625
♪ Joust! Joust! Joust! Joust! Joust! ♪

03:08.626 --> 03:10.429
- ♪ Joust! Joust! Joust! Joust! ♪
- Okay...

03:10.430 --> 03:12.270
- ♪ Joust! Joust! Joust! ♪
- All right. I'll...

03:13.250 --> 03:15.060
It's not gonna work.

03:15.070 --> 03:17.409
All right, Rory, I got your
glitter glue and scissors.

03:17.410 --> 03:18.479
Could not find a strobe light.

03:18.480 --> 03:21.179
All of these buttons are pictures
of me from the left side.

03:21.180 --> 03:23.189
- So?
- My left side is my bad side,

03:23.190 --> 03:24.250
Mother. Please fix this.

03:24.260 --> 03:25.759
Okay, Douglas, you maybe
want to step in here?

03:25.760 --> 03:28.320
I made you two blond helpers.
What more do you want?

03:29.150 --> 03:31.420
You gotta see this!

03:33.067 --> 03:36.419
Rory Banks says he's pro-recess.

03:36.420 --> 03:39.110
But what was he doing on the
sunniest day of the year?

03:39.120 --> 03:41.280
Oh, my gosh.

03:41.284 --> 03:42.909
It's hard to read with the glare!

03:42.910 --> 03:45.899
He says he wants to cut math.

03:45.900 --> 03:48.299
But then why choose a
running mate who knows...

03:48.300 --> 03:49.760
algebra?

03:49.780 --> 03:51.019
You two swore that there was no

03:51.020 --> 03:53.120
compromising footage of
you floating around.

03:53.129 --> 03:56.509
A vote for Rory is a vote against fun.

03:56.510 --> 03:59.759
I'm Bunny Ears, and I
approve this message.

03:59.760 --> 04:02.550
Losers?! M-My kids are not losers!

04:02.560 --> 04:04.550
Who the hell does that
child think she is?

04:04.557 --> 04:06.049
And why the hell do we have buttons

04:06.050 --> 04:08.602
with a picture of Rory
from his bad side?

04:08.603 --> 04:10.562
I gave birth to that bad
side, and I still hate it.

04:10.563 --> 04:13.389
All right, Emma, fetch
me my expensive marker.

04:13.390 --> 04:14.566
I'm tagging in!

04:14.567 --> 04:15.609
Let's go!

04:15.610 --> 04:17.777
- You look great.
- Thank you.

04:17.778 --> 04:21.156
Thank you for throwing out
that hideous bomber jacket.

04:21.156 --> 04:22.159
- Oh, you're welcome.
- Hey,

04:22.160 --> 04:23.599
does Miggy's new relationship

04:23.600 --> 04:24.743
seem odd to you?

04:24.744 --> 04:25.749
I dunno.

04:25.750 --> 04:27.705
Louisa made me carry a pocket watch.

04:27.706 --> 04:31.340
Oh. And where's the
braided belt I got you?

04:31.375 --> 04:34.419
Oh! Uh, I-I-I got bored
and unbraided it.

04:34.420 --> 04:35.754
I'm sorry, Bobbi.

04:35.755 --> 04:37.519
I wanted to see what would happen.

04:37.520 --> 04:38.715
It's what you think.

04:38.716 --> 04:39.719
Mm.

04:39.720 --> 04:41.619
Oh.

04:41.620 --> 04:43.012
- I'll be right back.
- Oh, okay.

04:43.650 --> 04:44.699
Hey, guys.

04:44.700 --> 04:46.759
Miggy, let's dish.

04:46.760 --> 04:48.975
Is this new relationship
making you miserable?

04:48.976 --> 04:50.659
You kidding? It's amazing!

04:50.660 --> 04:52.729
Bobbi takes me to dinner
every night at the club,

04:52.730 --> 04:54.105
she buys me all new stuff,

04:54.106 --> 04:57.067
and all I have to do is be a
completely different person.

04:57.068 --> 04:59.270
Love is about changing yourself

04:59.280 --> 05:00.979
to be whatever the other person wants.

05:00.980 --> 05:03.619
- True story.
- I don't think that's true.

05:03.620 --> 05:06.679
Actually, I am nervous about
the Whistling Pines Clam Bake.

05:06.680 --> 05:09.079
I don't know what they do at clam bakes!

05:09.080 --> 05:11.319
And if I mess this up in front
of her celebrity clients,

05:11.320 --> 05:13.119
she's gonna dump me for sure.

05:13.120 --> 05:15.753
It's gonna be hard going
back to that DFBL.

05:17.296 --> 05:18.629
Dat Frozen Burrito Life.

05:18.630 --> 05:19.839
Well, you're in luck.

05:19.840 --> 05:21.999
I know everything about clam bakes.

05:22.000 --> 05:24.886
My American Girl doll,
Tinsley, summers in Nantucket.

05:24.887 --> 05:26.069
Yeah!

05:26.070 --> 05:27.347
One question.

05:27.348 --> 05:28.640
What's clams?

05:28.641 --> 05:30.308
Ignore him.

05:30.309 --> 05:32.227
♪ Joust! Joust! ♪

05:32.228 --> 05:33.450
Damn.

05:33.460 --> 05:34.969
That was a good episode.

05:34.970 --> 05:38.059
Yeah, I just stress-ate
that whole pizza.

05:38.060 --> 05:41.019
♪ Joust! Joust, Joust, Joust! ♪

05:41.020 --> 05:42.050
Mm.

05:43.650 --> 05:44.823
- Tracy Freeze?!
- Hi.

05:44.824 --> 05:46.866
What are you doing here? Did I
leave the green screen down?

05:46.867 --> 05:48.119
What? No.

05:48.120 --> 05:50.619
Okay, this might be insane, I know,

05:50.620 --> 05:52.840
but I broke up with Travis... finally.

05:52.850 --> 05:55.189
And I found myself driving
here without a plan.

05:55.190 --> 05:56.499
And then I sat in my car rehearsing

05:56.500 --> 05:57.699
what I was gonna say
to you for 10 minutes,

05:57.700 --> 05:59.129
and now I'm here, and...

05:59.130 --> 06:00.422
I forgot everything I was gonna say.

06:00.423 --> 06:02.674
So, to sum up...

06:02.675 --> 06:04.709
you wanna get a drink...

06:04.710 --> 06:05.760
with me?

06:05.761 --> 06:07.479
I...

06:07.480 --> 06:09.060
- Well, I...
- Hey.

06:09.070 --> 06:11.183
Ohhh... hi!

06:12.420 --> 06:14.279
Why are you looking at me like that?

06:14.280 --> 06:15.645
Do I have sauce on my face?

06:15.646 --> 06:17.319
I didn't realize I was
interrupting something.

06:17.320 --> 06:18.565
No! Pbht!

06:18.566 --> 06:20.317
You're not... really. I am no one.

06:20.318 --> 06:21.401
Yeah, she's no one.

06:21.402 --> 06:23.519
This was nuts, and I know that.

06:23.520 --> 06:25.196
So... I'll talk to you tomorrow.

06:25.197 --> 06:27.241
Um, I'll see you
tomorrow at the toaster.

06:27.242 --> 06:28.760
Toaster.

06:30.770 --> 06:33.163
Oh, my God! What just happened?

06:33.164 --> 06:35.039
I think your boss just broke
up with her boyfriend

06:35.040 --> 06:36.875
and immediately drove
here to ask you out.

06:36.876 --> 06:38.376
That's so awesome! How did I do?

06:38.377 --> 06:40.253
Bad! You straight-up rejected her.

06:40.254 --> 06:42.259
Why did I do that? I'm such an idiot!

06:42.260 --> 06:45.130
Oh, God, you got to go and catch her!

06:45.134 --> 06:47.385
Oh, and she's s-still out in her car!

06:47.386 --> 06:48.590
But what about "Joust"?

06:48.600 --> 06:49.940
We were just gonna watch episode 8.

06:49.980 --> 06:52.300
Dude, we can pick it up
tomorrow. Go! Now!

06:52.308 --> 06:53.349
Okay. I'm gonna go.

06:53.350 --> 06:54.476
Don't steal anything.

06:55.720 --> 06:57.629
But seriously, don't steal anything.

07:05.400 --> 07:06.599
Hmm.

07:06.600 --> 07:09.240
Not bad for someone who's
had two glasses of scotch.

07:09.241 --> 07:10.408
It's four.

07:10.409 --> 07:12.450
And actually, this would be much better

07:12.460 --> 07:14.209
if I could use my charcoals.

07:14.210 --> 07:15.538
- Charcoals?
- That's right.

07:15.539 --> 07:17.679
Oh, you fancy.

07:17.680 --> 07:19.084
I'm impressed, by the way.

07:19.085 --> 07:20.794
You are? Why?

07:20.795 --> 07:23.219
I don't know... it's late, you're here,

07:23.220 --> 07:25.619
killing yourself over a
poster for our kids...

07:25.620 --> 07:26.919
- Yes.
- ... and you could be at the club.

07:26.920 --> 07:28.249
Oh, you know, I could be.

07:28.250 --> 07:30.599
And it happens to be
surf 'n' turf night.

07:30.600 --> 07:32.469
- Tonight?
- You heard me.

07:32.470 --> 07:35.300
And I haven't missed one of
those since the late '90s.

07:35.310 --> 07:38.269
They have a plaque for me
above the lobster tank.

07:38.270 --> 07:40.170
Oh. Well, then you should go. I mean...

07:40.180 --> 07:41.329
No. I don't want to go.

07:41.330 --> 07:43.039
You should go, Douglas. I...

07:43.040 --> 07:44.439
I'm taking a week off shellfish.

07:44.440 --> 07:46.409
We can do this later.

07:46.410 --> 07:48.340
I don't want to go. I
want to be with you.

07:49.920 --> 07:51.950
- O-Oh.
- Yep.

07:58.666 --> 08:00.289
Oh, my God.

08:00.290 --> 08:01.449
It's Rory.

08:01.450 --> 08:03.253
He said Bunny Ears dropped
out of the election.

08:03.254 --> 08:05.089
- No.
- Yes!

08:05.090 --> 08:07.382
That means he's running uncontested,

08:07.383 --> 08:09.089
so he's automatically gonna win.

08:09.090 --> 08:11.390
My son is a young black president.

08:11.400 --> 08:13.329
- I made an Obama!
- Amazing!

08:13.330 --> 08:14.449
- Ooh!
- We did it!

08:14.450 --> 08:15.515
- We did it!
- Ahh!

08:24.810 --> 08:26.279
Whew.

08:26.280 --> 08:27.444
What just happened?

08:27.445 --> 08:28.569
Unclear.

08:28.570 --> 08:30.799
So, I'm gonna go, 'cause it's... late.

08:30.800 --> 08:32.080
- Yes. So late.
- Great.

08:32.100 --> 08:33.400
- Okay.
- Awesome.

08:33.409 --> 08:35.220
- Bye.
- Bye.

08:36.409 --> 08:37.519
I'll finish the posters.

08:37.520 --> 08:39.331
Yeah.

08:43.679 --> 08:45.760
Last night was so fun.

08:45.770 --> 08:48.757
It was so fun. We were at that
bar for like three hours.

08:48.758 --> 08:51.219
Four, if you count the hour we
made out in the parking lot.

08:51.220 --> 08:52.619
Ahh!

08:52.620 --> 08:53.879
Hey!

08:53.880 --> 08:55.419
Can someone give me a ride home?

08:55.420 --> 08:57.850
I left my car at an Arby's,
Lord knows which one.

08:57.860 --> 08:59.339
Guy. Not now.

08:59.340 --> 09:01.639
Fantastic.

09:01.640 --> 09:03.860
Uh...

09:03.880 --> 09:05.999
What if we... hang out again tonight?

09:06.000 --> 09:07.734
Is... Is that crazy?

09:07.735 --> 09:08.739
Yeah, I'm down.

09:08.740 --> 09:10.439
Oh! I have plans with Angie.

09:10.440 --> 09:11.860
But you know what? Let
me give her a call.

09:11.864 --> 09:13.209
One second.

09:15.700 --> 09:17.620
Will.

09:17.630 --> 09:19.149
Hello!

09:19.150 --> 09:20.497
Hey, Angie phalange.

09:20.498 --> 09:21.998
It's your boy Will Cooper.

09:21.999 --> 09:23.789
Things are going so well with Tracy,

09:23.790 --> 09:25.949
so I think we're gonna
go out again tonight,

09:25.950 --> 09:27.295
which means I'll be late for "Joust."

09:27.296 --> 09:28.959
Wow! Pbht.

09:28.960 --> 09:30.924
Three nights in a row, huh?

09:30.925 --> 09:33.139
Is anyone even doing the
news over at KZOP anymore?

09:33.140 --> 09:34.799
Or is it all just toast and make-outs?

09:34.800 --> 09:35.959
- Are you annoyed?
- No,

09:35.960 --> 09:37.229
not at all. I just...

09:37.230 --> 09:39.029
want to know what my night
looks like, that's all.

09:39.030 --> 09:40.999
Plus, we have to stay on
schedule for the premiere,

09:41.000 --> 09:42.600
- remember?
- Will.

09:42.603 --> 09:44.839
Your toast is ready.

09:46.610 --> 09:47.691
I'll be there by 10:00.

09:47.692 --> 09:48.779
Bye.

09:48.780 --> 09:51.690
Well, Will's having his toast
made by some broad at work.

09:51.700 --> 09:54.155
- So that's great. Happy for him.
- I kissed Douglas.

09:54.156 --> 09:56.149
- Huh?! Fogerty?
- Yes.

09:56.150 --> 09:57.489
- Douglas Fogerty?
- Yes.

09:57.490 --> 09:58.819
- Douglas Fogerty?
- Yep.

09:58.820 --> 10:00.139
- No!
- Ow!

10:00.140 --> 10:01.496
- Were you drunk?
- I wish.

10:01.497 --> 10:02.929
That would explain it. It just...

10:02.930 --> 10:05.041
It happened, like Chris
Harrison said it would.

10:05.042 --> 10:06.167
Did you like it?

10:06.168 --> 10:08.669
I mean, Douglas stands for
everything that I hate.

10:08.670 --> 10:09.754
He calls dinner "supper."

10:09.755 --> 10:10.755
Blegh.

10:10.756 --> 10:13.890
But... I mean, I didn't not like it.

10:13.900 --> 10:14.960
Oh, my God.

10:14.969 --> 10:16.469
- You liked it!
- Eh.

10:16.470 --> 10:17.804
Did he?

10:17.805 --> 10:19.389
Of course he did. You're a total piece.

10:19.390 --> 10:20.959
- Thanks, girl.
- So, what happened after?

10:20.960 --> 10:22.809
Nothing. We haven't talked... I
mean, I haven't even seen him.

10:22.810 --> 10:23.810
And you weren't drunk?

10:23.811 --> 10:25.395
Girl, you already asked me that!

10:25.396 --> 10:26.729
Am I drunk? What's happening?!

10:26.730 --> 10:28.550
I gotta figure this out.

10:29.250 --> 10:30.775
Damn.

10:30.776 --> 10:33.027
Another crazy day at the picnic tables.

10:33.028 --> 10:36.290
In a past life, I died on a ship.

10:36.949 --> 10:38.099
All right.

10:41.370 --> 10:42.453
Mmm!

10:42.454 --> 10:45.164
Strong brine, smooth finish.

10:45.165 --> 10:47.876
This is a delicious East Bay littleneck.

10:47.877 --> 10:50.003
- How am I doing?
- You've become a real pro.

10:50.004 --> 10:52.213
Yes!

10:52.214 --> 10:54.049
Ooh, gotta go meet my makeup guy.

10:54.050 --> 10:55.279
Your makeup guy?

10:55.280 --> 10:57.310
Bobbi wants me to cover up my tattoos.

10:57.320 --> 10:59.879
The clam bake's on the beach,
so I'll have my shirt off,

10:59.880 --> 11:02.179
and she says my tattoos
don't go with clams.

11:02.180 --> 11:03.919
Miggy, do you hear yourself?

11:03.920 --> 11:05.518
She's treating you like a Barbie doll.

11:05.519 --> 11:07.520
I'm not a doll. I'm a boyfriend.

11:07.521 --> 11:08.730
Are you sure?

11:08.731 --> 11:09.789
Yeah.

11:09.790 --> 11:12.229
W-Well, maybe I've been so
busy taking care of Jack,

11:12.230 --> 11:14.470
I like having someone take care of me.

11:14.480 --> 11:17.280
Well, I can't stand by and watch
you erase your Miggy-ness.

11:17.281 --> 11:19.282
S-Sophie...

11:19.283 --> 11:21.369
Eh, sounds like a pretty sweet setup.

11:21.370 --> 11:22.769
I say just go limp

11:22.770 --> 11:24.910
and enjoy the easy river, muchacho.

11:26.498 --> 11:27.679
Hi!

11:27.680 --> 11:29.279
Sorry I am late.

11:29.280 --> 11:30.679
The restaurant was packed,

11:30.680 --> 11:32.449
and then Guy McCormick
crashed our dinner,

11:32.450 --> 11:34.739
and long story short, we
had to call his sponsor.

11:34.740 --> 11:35.750
I just lost track of time,

11:35.758 --> 11:37.319
but I'm here now...

11:37.320 --> 11:39.280
ready to watch episode 8,

11:39.300 --> 11:40.819
"The Winds of Bloodfire."

11:40.820 --> 11:42.597
♪ Joust! Joust! Joust! Joust! ♪

11:42.598 --> 11:43.891
I already watched it.

11:44.760 --> 11:46.849
You watched it? Without me?

11:46.850 --> 11:49.169
Well, yeah. I mean, you said you
were gonna be here hours ago,

11:49.170 --> 11:51.900
and then you weren't,
so... I watched it.

11:52.880 --> 11:53.980
Okay.

11:54.000 --> 11:55.760
- You seem upset.
- Au contraire !

11:55.770 --> 11:58.409
I am thrilled that
everyone is finding love.

11:58.410 --> 11:59.489
Over the moon!

11:59.490 --> 12:01.399
- "Everyone"?
- You and Tracy,

12:01.400 --> 12:02.539
Miggy, Poppy...

12:02.540 --> 12:04.200
- Who's Poppy into?
- No one!

12:04.203 --> 12:06.284
And if you knew, it
would blow your mind!

12:06.285 --> 12:07.599
Okay, so now you're punishing me

12:07.600 --> 12:09.579
by withholding gossip? You know what?

12:09.580 --> 12:11.289
You're the one who watched
the episode without me.

12:11.290 --> 12:12.299
You're the betrayer.

12:12.300 --> 12:14.080
You are the half-hand of Tirélea.

12:16.757 --> 12:19.092
I think we should "Joust" separately.

12:19.093 --> 12:20.969
- You don't mean that.
- I can't depend on you.

12:20.970 --> 12:22.762
You are not committed to the Tournament!

12:22.763 --> 12:24.099
Yes, I am!

12:24.100 --> 12:26.559
You're just mad 'cause I'm
finally the one canceling plans.

12:26.560 --> 12:27.703
When you were with Owen,

12:27.704 --> 12:29.469
you would cancel on me all the time.

12:29.470 --> 12:31.279
You even texted me once, "Sorry.

12:31.280 --> 12:32.939
- Got a ticket to Bone Town"!
- Okay,

12:32.940 --> 12:35.049
it was a round trip to Doinks-ville,

12:35.050 --> 12:36.860
and it would've been rude to refuse it!

12:36.880 --> 12:38.579
Meanwhile, I'm at home, single,

12:38.580 --> 12:40.279
binge-watching "Planet Earth" on my own,

12:40.280 --> 12:41.380
and I got by fine.

12:41.400 --> 12:42.660
Well, I guess we're good on our own.

12:42.670 --> 12:44.849
I'll just log out of
your Netflix account.

12:44.850 --> 12:46.519
- Good!
- Great!

12:46.520 --> 12:47.620
Wonderful!

12:47.630 --> 12:49.120
- Awesome!
- Do it!

12:49.123 --> 12:50.409
I'm doing it!

12:50.410 --> 12:51.439
Okay.

12:51.440 --> 12:54.294
Uh, I guess... I'll be going, then.

12:54.960 --> 12:57.290
Actually, can you log
back in really quick?

12:57.297 --> 12:58.299
That was a crazy move.

12:58.300 --> 13:00.508
I don't want to pay for my own account.

13:03.470 --> 13:05.138
Poppy. Hey.

13:05.139 --> 13:06.809
Hi.

13:08.851 --> 13:10.909
So, about last night...

13:10.910 --> 13:12.353
the... kiss.

13:12.354 --> 13:13.359
Yes.

13:13.360 --> 13:15.398
Yes, the kiss. I-I was there.

13:15.399 --> 13:18.693
Right. Should we...
talk about it, or... ?

13:18.694 --> 13:20.389
Sure. Yeah.

13:20.390 --> 13:21.599
Talk.

13:21.600 --> 13:22.690
H-Hey, you know what?

13:22.700 --> 13:24.530
Tony is, uh, making
me supper, and, uh...

13:24.533 --> 13:26.759
... would you care to join, or... ?

13:26.760 --> 13:28.619
Uh, join you?

13:28.620 --> 13:30.740
For dinner? Like... Like a date?

13:30.748 --> 13:32.248
Well, it doesn't have to be a date.

13:32.249 --> 13:34.834
Or it... it could be, I guess.

13:34.835 --> 13:37.169
- Oh.
- We could toast to Rory winning.

13:37.170 --> 13:38.539
Okay.

13:38.540 --> 13:41.470
Was that crazy or what?

13:41.480 --> 13:43.590
I mean, Bunny Ears just
dropped out of the race.

13:43.600 --> 13:46.380
- That was an act of God.
- Mm-hmm.

13:46.430 --> 13:48.222
Why do you have a weird look?

13:48.223 --> 13:49.689
What... Did you do something?

13:49.690 --> 13:50.879
It doesn't matter.

13:50.880 --> 13:53.019
The point is, the rabbit
is out of the race.

13:53.020 --> 13:54.419
What did you do, Douglas?

13:54.420 --> 13:57.399
I merely encouraged her to step aside.

13:57.400 --> 13:59.499
Look, Poppy, everyone has their price,

13:59.500 --> 14:02.169
and her price was a $600 scooter.

14:02.170 --> 14:03.988
I talked her down from a Jet Ski.

14:03.989 --> 14:05.907
You rigged a child's election?

14:05.908 --> 14:07.399
What is wrong with you?!

14:07.400 --> 14:08.899
And what the hell kind
of bougie-ass scooter

14:08.900 --> 14:10.244
costs $600?!

14:10.245 --> 14:11.829
Where are you going?

14:11.830 --> 14:13.579
To fix this.

14:13.580 --> 14:15.330
To put Bunny Ears back on the ballot!

14:15.334 --> 14:16.779
What, you don't want Rory to win?

14:16.780 --> 14:18.544
Not like this.

14:18.545 --> 14:20.671
I can't believe I let you kiss me.

14:20.672 --> 14:21.959
I... E-E-Excuse me.

14:21.960 --> 14:23.000
You kissed me.

14:23.008 --> 14:25.339
Oh, no, no, no. No!

14:25.340 --> 14:26.920
You kissed me. You leaned down.

14:26.929 --> 14:28.429
Oh! You leaned up.

14:28.430 --> 14:30.739
- What?! No! You leaned down!
- Yeah. You leaned up.

14:30.740 --> 14:31.979
- Down! Down!
- Up.

14:31.980 --> 14:32.989
- Down!
- Up!!

14:32.990 --> 14:34.029
You leaned... Doesn't matter,

14:34.030 --> 14:35.562
'cause it's never gonna happen again.

14:35.563 --> 14:36.920
Okay?

14:37.830 --> 14:39.599
Down!

14:40.710 --> 14:42.220
Up.

14:42.680 --> 14:45.269
Amazing work!

14:45.270 --> 14:46.839
Really brings out your nipples.

14:46.840 --> 14:49.283
They're great, by the way...
perfectly symmetrical.

14:49.284 --> 14:51.270
Well, you could see them
before, but thanks.

14:51.280 --> 14:53.739
You are just too good to be true.

14:53.740 --> 14:55.319
I can't believe I met

14:55.320 --> 14:58.334
a perfectly nippled man who loves clams

14:58.335 --> 15:01.171
and spends all of his free
time watching me golf.

15:01.172 --> 15:02.679
Mwah!

15:02.680 --> 15:05.039
We should have these tattoos
removed permanently.

15:05.040 --> 15:06.179
- What?
- I have an in

15:06.180 --> 15:08.029
with a top plastic surgeon.

15:08.030 --> 15:10.805
I fixed his slice, he lowered
my hairline 2 inches.

15:10.806 --> 15:12.399
Get your shirt. Let's go.

15:16.370 --> 15:18.354
Bobbi, I...

15:18.355 --> 15:20.790
I don't want to get rid of my tattoos.

15:20.800 --> 15:22.009
They're who I am.

15:22.010 --> 15:23.260
Well, so was my widow's peak,

15:23.270 --> 15:25.024
but I looked like Nosferatu.

15:25.025 --> 15:27.560
That's cool. And you should
be whoever you want.

15:27.580 --> 15:29.480
But so should I.

15:31.090 --> 15:32.160
What are you doing?

15:32.161 --> 15:33.786
Stop that!

15:33.787 --> 15:35.621
Miggy!

15:35.622 --> 15:37.790
I'm not a guy who
belongs at a clam bake.

15:37.791 --> 15:39.559
And, Bobbi, this is gonna sting, but...

15:39.560 --> 15:41.252
I don't enjoy watching you golf.

15:41.253 --> 15:43.921
So, then, what do you enjoy?

15:43.922 --> 15:45.690
I-I enjoy staying up all night

15:45.700 --> 15:47.399
looking at pictures of sneakers.

15:47.400 --> 15:49.677
I enjoy every odd-numbered installment

15:49.678 --> 15:51.139
of the "Fast and the Furious" franchise.

15:51.140 --> 15:53.320
- #JusticeForHan.
- Who's Han?

15:53.330 --> 15:55.190
I enjoy starting sentences with "Yo."

15:55.200 --> 15:57.619
I enjoy ending sentences with "Yo."

15:57.620 --> 16:01.249
I enjoy quality time with my son.

16:01.250 --> 16:04.200
And I enjoy orange slices...

16:04.220 --> 16:05.840
yo.

16:06.760 --> 16:09.119
That took a lot of courage.

16:09.120 --> 16:10.865
I appreciate your honesty.

16:10.866 --> 16:12.229
Thanks.

16:12.230 --> 16:15.629
And sorry I didn't say this sooner.

16:15.630 --> 16:17.699
I guess I was scared that
you wouldn't like me

16:17.700 --> 16:19.040
if I was just myself.

16:19.041 --> 16:21.239
- Ohh!
- Yeah.

16:21.240 --> 16:22.874
Your instincts were right.

16:22.875 --> 16:23.999
- Wait. What?
- Sorry.

16:24.000 --> 16:27.590
I have no interest in the
man you just described.

16:27.591 --> 16:28.716
Be well.

16:28.717 --> 16:30.799
Delete the photos I sent you.

16:30.800 --> 16:32.039
- All of them?
- Yeah.

16:32.040 --> 16:33.149
Okay.

16:33.150 --> 16:34.222
Bye-bye.

16:34.223 --> 16:35.890
Dang.

16:37.226 --> 16:39.268
And as you make your way to the polls,

16:39.269 --> 16:40.853
which open in five minutes,

16:40.854 --> 16:43.522
remember, I'm all you've ever known.

16:43.523 --> 16:44.549
Thank you.

16:48.270 --> 16:50.240
Girls, I'm shiny. Blot me.

16:52.650 --> 16:53.980
I hope you're happy, Mother.

16:53.990 --> 16:55.368
Getting Bunny Ears back into the race...

16:55.369 --> 16:57.219
Oh, Rory, don't you want
to win on your own?

16:57.220 --> 16:59.039
Not because some kid got
bribed with a scooter?

16:59.040 --> 17:00.456
A win is a win!

17:00.457 --> 17:02.359
Oh! Fogerty! Thank God.

17:02.360 --> 17:03.829
Okay, I need a big idea.

17:03.830 --> 17:05.659
I got five minutes to turn this crowd.

17:05.660 --> 17:07.179
All right, look, all you got to do is...

17:07.180 --> 17:08.479
is speak from the heart.

17:08.480 --> 17:10.348
All right? Don't sell them on promises.

17:10.349 --> 17:11.759
Sell them on yourself.

17:11.760 --> 17:14.329
Wait. Talk about me? Of course.

17:14.339 --> 17:15.469
It was right in front
of me the whole time.

17:15.470 --> 17:16.880
Thank you!

17:18.267 --> 17:19.519
Am I losing my mind,

17:19.520 --> 17:21.769
or did you just give my
kid some decent advice?

17:21.770 --> 17:24.628
Every now and then, it happens.

17:24.630 --> 17:26.898
Look, uh, about Bunny Ears,

17:26.900 --> 17:28.067
that was stupid.

17:28.068 --> 17:30.111
I know how much the
election meant to you,

17:30.112 --> 17:31.654
and I... just wanted to help.

17:31.655 --> 17:32.839
Listen, I get it.

17:32.840 --> 17:36.140
And... accidents happen.

17:37.050 --> 17:38.619
And I may have leaned down.

17:38.620 --> 17:40.413
Really?

17:40.414 --> 17:42.419
Yeah, well, that's how it's always gone

17:42.420 --> 17:44.989
when I've... thought about it.

17:44.990 --> 17:47.660
Oh, so you've thought about kissing me?

17:48.360 --> 17:50.289
Once or twice.

17:50.290 --> 17:51.489
You?

17:51.490 --> 17:54.135
Attention, Hilltop voters.

17:54.136 --> 17:56.804
A wise and very old man

17:56.805 --> 17:59.140
has told me to be honest about myself.

17:59.141 --> 18:00.599
Here I go.

18:00.600 --> 18:05.439
I, Rory Banks, love things.

18:05.440 --> 18:09.233
My mom buys me things, and
she can buy you things, too.

18:09.234 --> 18:11.485
- No.
- Let my mom buy you things.

18:11.486 --> 18:13.404
Rory Banks! 2019!

18:13.405 --> 18:15.072
Out!

18:18.660 --> 18:19.994
Ugh!

18:22.664 --> 18:24.913
Okay, you're definitely
chipping in for this.

18:32.440 --> 18:34.759
Okay, so, we're just walking
into each other's houses now?

18:34.760 --> 18:37.637
I have a very soft knock.
You just didn't hear it.

18:37.638 --> 18:41.019
But I brought a peace offering.

18:41.020 --> 18:42.039
Oh, my God.

18:42.040 --> 18:44.226
Giant turkey legs?

18:45.310 --> 18:47.119
Just like they eat at
The Winner's Feast.

18:47.120 --> 18:48.439
Where did you find these?

18:48.440 --> 18:51.719
At a, uh, Ren faire that
was oh so far away.

18:51.720 --> 18:54.880
But I wanted to show
you how sorry I was.

18:55.790 --> 18:57.323
You don't need to be sorry.

18:57.324 --> 18:59.559
You met a girl. You liked her.

18:59.560 --> 19:00.659
It happens.

19:00.660 --> 19:02.203
Also, these are really heavy.

19:02.204 --> 19:04.199
No turkey should have legs this huge.

19:04.200 --> 19:05.489
Yeah, those are full of hormones.

19:05.490 --> 19:07.040
I would not eat a...

19:07.050 --> 19:08.639
- Oh.
- Too late.

19:08.640 --> 19:10.809
Anyway...

19:10.810 --> 19:12.979
I'm sorry, too.

19:12.980 --> 19:15.039
I shouldn't have raged out at you.

19:15.040 --> 19:16.634
I guess maybe I was a little jealous.

19:16.635 --> 19:17.968
Jealous? Interesting.

19:17.969 --> 19:20.471
You had a little taste
and you wanted more.

19:20.472 --> 19:22.632
Take it easy. I just got used
to our hangs. That's all.

19:24.260 --> 19:26.519
But I'm excited for you.

19:26.520 --> 19:28.629
You deserve to be happy...

19:28.630 --> 19:29.730
ya big weirdo.

19:29.731 --> 19:31.857
Thank you.

19:31.858 --> 19:33.776
So...

19:33.777 --> 19:36.153
are you gonna tell me
who Poppy's dating?

19:36.154 --> 19:37.839
Oh, it's not happening anymore.
They were friends.

19:37.840 --> 19:39.825
It's... a little too complicated.

19:39.826 --> 19:41.820
Yeah, I get that.

19:43.650 --> 19:44.662
But seriously, who was it?

19:44.663 --> 19:46.580
Nope. Classified information, bro.

19:46.581 --> 19:48.374
- Please? Please?
- But you know what?

19:48.375 --> 19:51.039
If you make me some popcorn,
maybe I'll tell you.

19:51.040 --> 19:52.760
- I'm on it.
- And wash my car.

19:52.770 --> 19:54.539
- Okay.
- And empty the dishwasher?

19:54.540 --> 19:56.359
Oh, I see. You're never actually
gonna tell me, are you?

19:56.360 --> 19:58.759
Correct. But do make the
popcorn, because...

19:58.760 --> 20:00.886
season 4 is about to start!

20:00.887 --> 20:02.859
- ♪ Joust! Joust! Joust! Joust! ♪
- ♪ Joust! Joust! Joust! ♪

20:02.860 --> 20:05.630
♪ Joust! Joust! Joust! Joust! Joust! ♪

20:07.660 --> 20:10.200
Ooh, a pin! Hey, guys.

20:10.260 --> 20:11.439
- Hey!
- Hi, Miggy!

20:11.440 --> 20:12.899
You look... comfortable.

20:12.900 --> 20:15.839
I am! My armpits can't stop smiling!

20:15.840 --> 20:17.139
How was the clam bake?

20:17.140 --> 20:18.379
Did they have sweet corn?

20:18.380 --> 20:19.709
Oh, I didn't go.

20:19.710 --> 20:22.179
Um, turns out Bobbi's not
a fan of the real me.

20:22.180 --> 20:23.199
I'm sorry, Miggy.

20:23.200 --> 20:24.319
Ah, don't be.

20:24.320 --> 20:26.539
As much as I liked Bobbi
taking care of me,

20:26.540 --> 20:28.540
you guys do a better job
than she ever could.

20:29.890 --> 20:30.919
Attention!

20:30.920 --> 20:32.559
Attention, please. Thank you.

20:32.560 --> 20:35.089
I just received a phone call
from President Bunny Ears.

20:35.090 --> 20:36.800
She has conceded.

20:39.300 --> 20:41.199
Now, my first order of business

20:41.200 --> 20:44.660
is that there will be no more elections!

20:44.670 --> 20:47.469
Bow before me!

20:47.470 --> 20:49.309
You heard him! Bow!

20:49.310 --> 20:51.279
Bow before your president!

20:51.280 --> 20:52.849
Bow!

20:54.570 --> 20:56.600
Oh, we've done something terrible.

20:56.650 --> 20:58.559
Maybe I've been too supportive.
