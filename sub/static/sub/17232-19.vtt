00:03.427 --> 00:04.560
Previously on "Nashville"...

00:04.594 --> 00:05.727
No, Maddie is my daughter,

00:05.761 --> 00:06.861
no matter who her biological father is.

00:06.896 --> 00:08.397
Listen, that performance tonight was great.

00:08.431 --> 00:09.564
I'd love to lay down a demo.

00:09.598 --> 00:11.799
I love you. That is the truth.

00:13.469 --> 00:15.970
I would like to propose a new alliance...

00:16.004 --> 00:17.305
the two of us.

00:18.707 --> 00:19.774
Go. Just get out.

00:19.808 --> 00:21.909
I'm sorry. I didn't mean it.

00:21.943 --> 00:24.578
- Where's Dante?
- His phone is going straight to voice mail.

00:24.612 --> 00:27.114
There's another $475,000 missing.

00:27.149 --> 00:29.616
You've reached Dante
Rivas. Leave a message.

00:31.000 --> 00:37.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:38.592 --> 00:40.760
I hired your security firm because

00:40.794 --> 00:42.795
I do not want the police involved.

00:42.829 --> 00:44.397
Then let's be clear...
you're letting Mr. Rivas

00:44.432 --> 00:46.599
get away with half a million dollars.

00:46.633 --> 00:48.234
Okay, allow me to be clearer.

00:48.269 --> 00:49.669
I can make that money back in two nights.

00:49.703 --> 00:51.871
What I can't get back is my reputation,

00:51.905 --> 00:53.638
which would be ruined if this gets out.

00:53.673 --> 00:56.141
- And I've had enough bad press this year.
- No.

00:56.226 --> 00:57.526
What about her credit cards?

00:57.560 --> 00:59.194
We've frozen all of them.

00:59.229 --> 01:00.529
We're tracing every charge
he might've tried overnight.

01:03.032 --> 01:06.101
Can you get that, please?
I'm not taking any calls.

01:06.136 --> 01:08.103
As far as I'm concerned...

01:08.138 --> 01:09.270
Hello?

01:09.304 --> 01:10.938
Dante does not exist to me.

01:10.972 --> 01:12.373
He means nothing to me.

01:12.407 --> 01:15.143
And the money means even less.

01:15.177 --> 01:16.310
Juliette?

01:16.345 --> 01:18.279
I'm not taking calls.

01:18.313 --> 01:20.781
You've just been nominated
for a C.M.A. award.

01:20.815 --> 01:23.584
Female vocalist of the year.

01:23.619 --> 01:25.218
What?

01:26.254 --> 01:27.387
Congratulations.

01:27.421 --> 01:29.289
This is the best news.

01:29.323 --> 01:31.658
I haven't won yet.

01:31.692 --> 01:35.728
Which is even more of a reason
why this should never get out.

01:40.734 --> 01:42.734
You know one thing that
hasn't changed at all?

01:42.769 --> 01:44.270
Mm. What?

01:44.304 --> 01:45.771
You still steal all the covers.

01:45.805 --> 01:47.439
I do not.

01:47.474 --> 01:48.874
Yes, you do.

01:48.908 --> 01:50.008
You throw 'em off.

01:50.043 --> 01:51.977
I'm freezing.

01:52.011 --> 01:53.445
Let me warm you up.

01:53.480 --> 01:55.247
Mm.

01:56.383 --> 01:59.784
I do not ever want to leave this bed.

02:01.953 --> 02:03.754
It feels like you didn't.

02:03.789 --> 02:05.657
Yeah.

02:07.293 --> 02:09.494
Oh, the phone's been
ringing off the hook...

02:09.527 --> 02:10.662
All night.

02:10.696 --> 02:12.863
You know what? No. Nope.

02:12.958 --> 02:14.758
I've been waiting 14 years for this.

02:14.792 --> 02:15.925
I get you all to myself.

02:15.960 --> 02:17.427
Okay. Have me.

02:17.462 --> 02:19.062
Mmm.

02:19.096 --> 02:21.365
Oh. Um...

02:21.399 --> 02:22.532
It's Maddie. Oh, okay.

02:22.567 --> 02:23.933
I'm sorry.

02:23.968 --> 02:25.969
Hey, sweetheart. What's going on?

02:26.003 --> 02:27.337
Did you see?

02:27.372 --> 02:28.838
You're nominated.

02:28.873 --> 02:30.573
Female vocalist of the year.

02:30.607 --> 02:31.607
It's all over Facebook and Twitter.

02:31.642 --> 02:33.743
Oh, my gosh!

02:33.777 --> 02:35.110
Awesome!

02:35.145 --> 02:38.714
And Juliette's nominated
in the same category, too.

02:38.749 --> 02:40.215
Awesome.

02:40.250 --> 02:43.118
Can I stay home today so we
can go shopping for your dress?

02:43.153 --> 02:44.953
No, honey. I will see you
when you get home from school.

02:44.988 --> 02:46.154
I can't wait.

02:46.188 --> 02:47.322
We'll talk all about it.

02:47.356 --> 02:48.590
Okay. Bye, mom. Love you.

02:48.624 --> 02:52.294
Thank you for that news. Bye.

02:55.964 --> 02:58.933
I just got nominated for
female vocalist of the year.

02:58.967 --> 03:00.602
Seriously?

03:00.636 --> 03:01.769
Mm-hmm!

03:01.803 --> 03:03.404
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

03:05.206 --> 03:06.940
You made me forget all
about the C.M.A. nominations.

03:06.974 --> 03:09.343
- I did that?
- You are good.

03:09.377 --> 03:11.178
- I'm something else, huh?
- Yeah, you are.

03:14.944 --> 03:17.478
You surprised the hell
out of me last night.

03:17.513 --> 03:20.114
I surprised the hell out of myself.

03:21.617 --> 03:23.418
Wanna get some breakfast?

03:23.452 --> 03:25.787
Mm-hmm.

03:25.821 --> 03:26.954
Maybe in a minute.

03:28.791 --> 03:30.758
Bucky.

03:30.793 --> 03:32.059
I'll call you back.

03:32.093 --> 03:33.960
Bye, Buck.

03:35.463 --> 03:36.797
Mmm.

03:36.831 --> 03:38.331
- Marshall.
- Oh, my God.

03:38.365 --> 03:40.667
You know what? Just take it.

03:40.701 --> 03:41.668
- Okay.
- You can't fight this.

03:41.702 --> 03:42.836
Hey, Marshall.

03:42.870 --> 03:44.003
Congratulations, Rayna.

03:44.038 --> 03:45.171
I know! It's exciting.

03:45.205 --> 03:46.573
It's a special day.

03:46.607 --> 03:49.242
Yes, today's a very special day.

03:49.276 --> 03:51.877
Hey, great news about your mom, huh?

03:51.912 --> 03:54.112
Yeah. I wanna make her something special.

03:54.147 --> 03:55.280
It's her ninth nomination,

03:55.315 --> 03:57.316
which happens to be my favorite number.

03:57.350 --> 03:58.784
'Cause you're 9?

03:58.819 --> 04:00.118
Maddie, I, uh...

04:00.153 --> 04:02.254
I got the e-mail from your school

04:02.288 --> 04:04.122
about the father-daughter
dance tomorrow night.

04:04.157 --> 04:05.824
Well, I have a report due, so...

04:05.858 --> 04:06.991
No, you don't.

04:07.025 --> 04:08.159
Shut up.

04:08.193 --> 04:09.828
Okay, girls, please. Come on.

04:09.862 --> 04:12.196
- Daph, will you, uh, will you give us a minute?
- Yep.

04:12.230 --> 04:13.565
Thank you.

04:16.869 --> 04:18.269
All right, listen.

04:18.303 --> 04:20.338
I know we've been going
through a rough time.

04:20.372 --> 04:22.339
And I also know that
you think I'm responsible

04:22.373 --> 04:24.508
for a big part of it,
and maybe you're right.

04:24.542 --> 04:29.546
But don't... don't punish
me by punishing yourself.

04:29.581 --> 04:31.849
Talia's going with her
father tomorrow night, right?

04:31.883 --> 04:33.817
I guess.

04:33.852 --> 04:35.652
Look...

04:35.687 --> 04:38.388
if you don't want to
dance with me, that's fine.

04:38.422 --> 04:39.555
Just let me take you to the party

04:39.590 --> 04:41.191
so you can spend some
time with your friends.

04:42.793 --> 04:43.960
I'll think about it.

04:43.995 --> 04:45.828
Okay.

04:47.298 --> 04:49.099
You might need something a little stronger

04:49.133 --> 04:51.567
for your hangover, though.

04:51.602 --> 04:53.503
Back home, we drink, uh, pellet tea.

04:53.537 --> 04:54.669
Oh, my God.

04:54.704 --> 04:56.472
It's rabbit pellets. It kills headaches.

04:56.506 --> 05:00.009
Yeah, I know what it is.
That's really disgusting, Will.

05:00.043 --> 05:02.044
So, um...

05:02.078 --> 05:03.912
Gunnar tell you about our night?

05:03.946 --> 05:06.948
No. I was in so late,
and he was already asleep.

05:06.983 --> 05:09.918
So I figured you guys
were just... at it again.

05:09.952 --> 05:12.120
What about it?

05:13.288 --> 05:14.522
You, you big party animal.

05:15.957 --> 05:18.592
We got so drunk. I didn't
know what I was doing.

05:18.627 --> 05:20.395
Being a horse's ass, probably.

05:20.429 --> 05:22.497
Yeah, well, the booze
isn't slowing this boy down.

05:22.531 --> 05:24.732
I mean, he gets up on stage.

05:24.766 --> 05:27.334
Next thing you know, a
producer wants to cut his demo.

05:27.368 --> 05:28.735
Which song?

05:28.769 --> 05:30.437
Something you haven't heard.

05:30.471 --> 05:31.871
Oh, would you play it for me later?

05:31.906 --> 05:33.873
I can if you want, but, uh,

05:33.908 --> 05:35.742
you probably won't like
it. It's not your thing.

05:35.776 --> 05:37.710
No, he's just being modest.

05:37.745 --> 05:39.246
Don't you have somewhere to be, Will?

05:40.548 --> 05:41.648
Gunnar.

05:43.283 --> 05:45.117
Yeah.

05:45.152 --> 05:47.420
It's... it's... it's cool. I'm...

05:47.454 --> 05:49.522
I just came to get some, uh...

05:49.557 --> 05:51.323
some things.

05:51.398 --> 05:52.932
And, uh, for some coffee.

05:52.967 --> 05:55.234
For which I am eternally grateful.

05:55.268 --> 05:57.303
No worry.

06:04.677 --> 06:06.377
Are you all right?

06:06.412 --> 06:08.580
You know he lives upstairs
and not down here, right?

06:08.615 --> 06:11.249
Am I witnessing the death of a bromance?

06:11.283 --> 06:13.085
Can you not call it that?
It's stupid, all right?

06:14.386 --> 06:16.787
Well, you guys spend
all your time together,

06:16.822 --> 06:19.423
and it's nice. You're like brothers.

06:19.457 --> 06:20.925
So you think he can walk in
here and just replace Jason?

06:20.959 --> 06:22.994
- 'Cause he can't.
- That is not what I said.

06:23.028 --> 06:25.830
And definitely not what I meant.

06:25.864 --> 06:27.832
Get me a meeting at the
label this afternoon.

06:27.866 --> 06:30.234
I wanna know how Marshall
plans to support my nomination.

06:30.268 --> 06:32.435
And I'm expecting a full media campaign,

06:32.469 --> 06:34.137
not a nickel spared.

06:34.171 --> 06:35.639
You haven't slept since yesterday.

06:35.673 --> 06:36.973
Are you sure I can't get you anything?

06:37.008 --> 06:39.208
The only thing I want is that
crystal award on my mantel.

06:39.243 --> 06:40.644
Hey.

06:40.678 --> 06:41.811
- Sorry I'm late.
- It's okay. Just...

06:41.846 --> 06:43.713
Is this about her nomination?

06:43.748 --> 06:45.949
Hey, baby, I heard about it on the radio.

06:45.983 --> 06:47.116
I'm so excited for you.

06:47.150 --> 06:48.517
Will you get her credit card?

06:48.551 --> 06:50.352
What, you're cutting me off now?

06:50.386 --> 06:53.488
No. It's just a security precaution.

06:53.523 --> 06:55.290
Honey, what the hell happened here?

06:57.661 --> 07:00.963
Look, you were right about Dante, okay?

07:00.997 --> 07:03.998
But he wasn't cheating
on me. He was just...

07:04.033 --> 07:05.566
plain cheatin'.

07:05.600 --> 07:08.502
He made off with half a
million bucks after the show.

07:08.537 --> 07:11.105
Baby, I'm so sorry.

07:11.140 --> 07:13.074
I... I am so sorry. I feel
like it's all my fault.

07:13.108 --> 07:14.709
- For br...
- No. Don't. Stop. No.

07:14.743 --> 07:16.610
It's not about you,
okay? Don't make a scene.

07:16.645 --> 07:18.512
I'm not making a scene.
But, honey, you trusted him.

07:18.547 --> 07:21.614
- And he was your...
- I know what he was.

07:21.649 --> 07:23.650
And I know what he is now.

07:23.685 --> 07:25.986
Dead to me.

07:26.020 --> 07:29.556
Emily will get you another credit card.

07:29.590 --> 07:31.324
- Hey, babe!
- Mmm!

07:31.358 --> 07:32.759
I just got your text.

07:32.794 --> 07:35.561
I'm on my way downtown,
but I really do wanna know,

07:35.595 --> 07:37.163
what's your news?

07:37.197 --> 07:39.231
You have a lot of energy,
and I am very tired.

07:39.265 --> 07:41.400
I know I do.

07:41.484 --> 07:43.585
Remember that thing that
we were talking about?

07:43.620 --> 07:45.087
No. What thing?

07:45.122 --> 07:46.688
"The thing"... the slutty thing?

07:46.723 --> 07:48.023
- Oh, the slutty thing.
- Yeah.

07:48.058 --> 07:49.925
- With Liam?
- Yeah, right.

07:49.960 --> 07:51.426
Not with Liam, exactly.

07:51.461 --> 07:52.761
What?

07:52.795 --> 07:55.297
Uh, I went over to Deacon's last night.

07:57.833 --> 07:59.501
How was it?

07:59.535 --> 08:00.669
- It was great.
- It was?

08:00.703 --> 08:02.571
It was great, yeah.

08:02.605 --> 08:03.739
How is it today?

08:03.773 --> 08:05.106
Great. Wonderful.

08:05.141 --> 08:07.775
It's just... it's just all so complicated.

08:07.809 --> 08:10.444
- Oh, sweetheart, it is always so complicated with you two.
- I know.

08:10.479 --> 08:12.880
You know, here we are,
finally after all these years,

08:12.914 --> 08:14.815
we can be together.

08:14.849 --> 08:16.884
And now the sort of...

08:16.918 --> 08:19.119
stark realities of...

08:19.154 --> 08:21.555
Let's not borrow trouble.

08:21.590 --> 08:23.290
It was just one night.

08:23.324 --> 08:24.624
It was a fling.

08:24.659 --> 08:26.593
No. It's never just gonna
be one night with him.

08:26.627 --> 08:27.994
It's not gonna be just a fling with him.

08:28.028 --> 08:29.696
Deacon and I have a relationship.

08:29.730 --> 08:32.198
We have always had a relationship.

08:32.232 --> 08:33.732
Okay.

08:33.767 --> 08:36.034
You just got out of a 14-year marriage.

08:36.068 --> 08:37.203
Right?

08:37.236 --> 08:38.370
With the two of you,

08:38.405 --> 08:42.107
it is always gonna be all or nothing.

08:42.142 --> 08:44.710
Are you sure that's what you want?

08:44.744 --> 08:46.846
Are you sure that's what he wants?

08:48.248 --> 08:51.149
You got a rock solid thing with Stacey.

08:51.184 --> 08:52.751
And you're willing to throw all that over

08:52.786 --> 08:53.985
for one night with Rayna?

08:54.020 --> 08:55.387
Look, I didn't plan for
this thing to happen,

08:55.422 --> 08:56.922
but... there it is, you know?

08:56.956 --> 08:58.824
I can't pretend it didn't.

08:58.858 --> 09:01.393
Look, go back to Stacey.
Beg her forgiveness.

09:01.428 --> 09:04.095
She's an amazing girl, all right? But...

09:05.230 --> 09:06.664
she's not Rayna.

09:06.699 --> 09:09.567
It's different, all right? You know that.

09:09.601 --> 09:11.669
And you know Rayna's like family to me.

09:11.704 --> 09:13.237
But she has been nothing
but trouble for you

09:13.271 --> 09:14.372
from day one.

09:14.406 --> 09:16.173
That is not... you don't understand.

09:16.208 --> 09:17.709
- I don't understand?
- Nope.

09:17.743 --> 09:19.510
First drink always tastes good going down.

09:19.545 --> 09:20.844
All right, you need to
stop talking about Rayna

09:20.878 --> 09:22.713
like she's some kind of
addiction to me, okay?

09:24.382 --> 09:26.583
What about Audrey? Could
you live without her?

09:26.617 --> 09:28.518
So what, is she some kind
of addiction to you then?

09:28.553 --> 09:30.253
Or maybe she's just the love of your life?

09:30.287 --> 09:33.156
Audrey hasn't been messing
with my mind all these years.

09:34.859 --> 09:36.192
It's different this time.

09:36.227 --> 09:37.526
- Oh, it's different?
- Yep.

09:37.561 --> 09:40.629
Okay, fine. Okay, but
you ask yourself this...

09:40.664 --> 09:42.465
are you willing to blow up your whole life

09:42.499 --> 09:44.633
without knowing for sure?

09:49.038 --> 09:52.007
♪

- www.addic7ed.com -

10:05.372 --> 10:07.405
Congratulations.

10:07.440 --> 10:10.107
Ah, thank you very much.

10:10.142 --> 10:11.810
- Thank you. Thank you.
- Congratulations. Thank you.

10:11.844 --> 10:13.778
So where's your new manager?

10:13.813 --> 10:15.947
He couldn't make it.

10:15.981 --> 10:18.015
Well, I'm sure he's over the moon.

10:18.050 --> 10:20.251
What an incredible turnaround
you've had, Juliette.

10:20.285 --> 10:22.487
Thank you. You know, I can't help but think

10:22.521 --> 10:24.955
it's got something to
do with my new material.

10:24.989 --> 10:26.990
Speaking of which, we're
hoping you'll do your new single

10:27.024 --> 10:28.925
at the nomination party tomorrow night.

10:28.960 --> 10:31.562
Of course. I would love to.

10:31.596 --> 10:33.497
And I'm hoping that I can count
on Edgehill to court votes,

10:33.531 --> 10:35.098
help me win this thing for real.

10:35.132 --> 10:36.433
Absolutely.

10:36.468 --> 10:38.569
We plan on supporting
all our nominated artists.

10:40.137 --> 10:42.805
Rayna's won four C.M.A. awards.

10:42.840 --> 10:45.275
This isn't gonna mean much to her,

10:45.309 --> 10:47.911
but it does to me.

10:47.945 --> 10:49.645
I want this, Marshall.

10:49.680 --> 10:50.813
Obviously, you're free to do

10:50.848 --> 10:53.049
all the campaigning for votes you want.

10:53.084 --> 10:55.585
But here we have certain budget constraints

10:55.619 --> 10:58.453
- that...
- Well, then I guess it's a good thing that I don't.

10:58.488 --> 10:59.889
Besides, I've learned in this business

10:59.923 --> 11:04.526
the only person you
can rely on is yourself.

11:04.560 --> 11:06.561
You are the sweetest thing.

11:06.596 --> 11:09.131
They are gorgeous. I'm
looking at 'em right now.

11:10.300 --> 11:11.900
Oh, you know what? Maddie's home.

11:11.934 --> 11:13.601
I'm gonna call you later, honey. Thank you.

11:13.635 --> 11:15.469
I'll talk to you later. Bye.

11:15.504 --> 11:17.171
- Hey.
- Hi.

11:17.206 --> 11:18.239
- Hi, babe.
- Hi.

11:18.274 --> 11:20.441
Ohh. How was your day?

11:20.520 --> 11:23.156
Better, now that you're home.

11:23.190 --> 11:25.624
I'm glad it's your week and not dad's.

11:25.659 --> 11:27.160
Why?

11:27.194 --> 11:29.527
Because he's making me go to
that stupid dance with him.

11:29.562 --> 11:31.129
Can you please try and talk him out of it?

11:31.164 --> 11:33.798
No, I'm not gonna talk him out of it.

11:33.833 --> 11:36.801
He's excited about that.
It means a lot to him.

11:36.836 --> 11:38.703
And you know your dad loves you very much.

11:38.737 --> 11:40.205
That doesn't mean I have to like him.

11:41.707 --> 11:44.442
It'd be good if you did like him.

11:50.048 --> 11:51.515
Sorry I'm late.

11:51.549 --> 11:53.317
Ah.

11:53.352 --> 11:54.551
I'm thinking you're about to stand me up.

11:54.586 --> 11:56.153
No, I wouldn't do that to you.

11:56.188 --> 11:57.621
I was thinking about our
conversation last week,

11:57.655 --> 12:00.991
and, uh, what you told me
about Teddy's cumberland deal.

12:01.025 --> 12:02.192
And?

12:02.226 --> 12:03.426
I'm not interested in being a pawn

12:03.461 --> 12:05.261
for either you or your father.

12:05.296 --> 12:09.665
So... you're content on putting
Nashville's best interests aside

12:09.700 --> 12:11.234
as well as you're own?

12:11.268 --> 12:13.269
Teddy's not a bad man.

12:13.304 --> 12:14.670
You're kidding, right?

12:14.705 --> 12:17.106
Well, you thought enough of
him to get him elected mayor.

12:17.140 --> 12:18.440
That wasn't my choice.

12:18.475 --> 12:20.342
And that was before I knew
what he was capable of.

12:20.377 --> 12:23.445
Before he started canceling
Wyatt Industries' contracts.

12:23.480 --> 12:26.348
I thought you stood for something, Cole.

12:26.383 --> 12:27.516
And I thought there was a difference

12:27.550 --> 12:29.418
between you and your father.

12:31.121 --> 12:33.187
The label picked up 11 nominations,

12:33.222 --> 12:34.688
including you and Juliette.

12:34.723 --> 12:36.524
So, yeah, the party's on the riverboat.

12:38.027 --> 12:40.428
So anyway, she'll perform first, uh...

12:40.462 --> 12:41.595
- Look out.
- Excuse me.

12:41.630 --> 12:42.930
And then you.

12:42.964 --> 12:44.965
By the way, uh, Liam sent
over some mixes for your album,

12:45.000 --> 12:46.967
and there was a torn
up plane ticket inside?

12:47.002 --> 12:48.168
St. Lucia?

12:48.202 --> 12:51.004
Yeah. He's not too happy with me right now.

12:51.039 --> 12:52.139
Don't ask.

12:52.173 --> 12:53.773
Okay, well, we gotta
get the album finished.

12:53.807 --> 12:56.243
I know. We'll get it done.
Listen, Liam is a big boy.

12:56.277 --> 12:57.411
He's not gonna let anything

12:57.445 --> 12:59.112
get in the way of getting that album done.

12:59.147 --> 13:00.480
Don't worry about that.

13:00.515 --> 13:03.750
Um, excuse me a quick second, okay?

13:05.252 --> 13:06.618
Sure.

13:06.653 --> 13:08.954
Okay, we got about three and a half minutes

13:08.988 --> 13:10.523
before the whole world
comes looking for you.

13:10.557 --> 13:12.425
Everybody's been talking
about these nominations.

13:12.459 --> 13:14.527
All I can think about is last night.

13:14.561 --> 13:16.262
Me, too.

13:19.999 --> 13:22.800
I was thinking, maybe after
the show tomorrow night...

13:22.834 --> 13:23.968
Mm-hmm?

13:24.002 --> 13:25.136
We go up to my cabin...

13:25.171 --> 13:26.504
Mmm.

13:26.539 --> 13:27.738
- Hide out...
- Oh.

13:27.773 --> 13:29.607
A little moonlight,

13:29.641 --> 13:30.775
a little canoeing.

13:30.809 --> 13:32.677
A little canoeing?

13:32.711 --> 13:34.446
Yeah, we probably won't canoe.

13:37.882 --> 13:39.015
- Mmm.
- How's that sound?

13:39.050 --> 13:40.551
That sounds so good.

13:40.585 --> 13:42.286
But I, um...

13:42.320 --> 13:43.853
I have the girls this week, so...

13:43.888 --> 13:46.390
we got a little celebration planned.

13:46.424 --> 13:48.658
You know, hot chocolate and
s'mores. That kinda thing.

13:48.693 --> 13:50.727
That's even better.

13:50.761 --> 13:52.195
I love me some s'mores.

13:52.229 --> 13:54.197
- Mm?
- I can do that.

13:54.231 --> 13:57.133
All right, well... let's see what happens.

13:59.903 --> 14:01.036
Okay.

14:01.071 --> 14:02.638
I mean, I'm a mama now.

14:02.672 --> 14:05.541
So I got kids and all
kinds of mundane things

14:05.576 --> 14:08.943
that aren't really the stuff
that romance is made of.

14:08.978 --> 14:11.846
Rayna, I love your kids...

14:11.880 --> 14:13.515

What do you think you're doing?!

15:26.325 --> 15:27.592
You're supposed to be loading out

15:27.626 --> 15:29.392
and not sittin' on your
asses, playing music.

15:29.487 --> 15:30.720
Yeah, we were just taking a little break.

15:30.754 --> 15:31.854
Well, break's over.

15:31.889 --> 15:34.624
Just do your damn jobs.

15:34.659 --> 15:35.724
I wanna go full court press.

15:35.758 --> 15:37.426
I want all of this sent to every member

15:37.460 --> 15:39.094
of the country music association.

15:39.128 --> 15:41.363
I'm not sure we have enough bobble-heads.

15:41.398 --> 15:42.698
Well, then order some more.

15:42.732 --> 15:45.167
You know what? Get 'em those
little bottles of Dom...

15:45.202 --> 15:46.635
the little cute ones.

15:46.670 --> 15:49.905
But you do realize there are
over 7,500 C.M.A. members.

15:49.939 --> 15:51.207
What's your point?

15:51.241 --> 15:53.008
Just that at $100 a pop,

15:53.042 --> 15:54.810
and with the money that Dante took,

15:54.844 --> 15:56.078
you're looking at over a million dollars.

15:56.112 --> 15:58.980
Would you just order the bottles?

16:03.452 --> 16:05.987
"Gun for a mouth"... I
mean, that is a killer title.

16:06.022 --> 16:07.288
Thanks, man.

16:07.323 --> 16:10.291
Hey, you get a chance to
listen to those other demos?

16:10.326 --> 16:11.559
- You mean the ballads?
- Yeah.

16:11.594 --> 16:13.294
They're cool.

16:13.329 --> 16:14.629
That's not what I heard the other night.

16:14.663 --> 16:17.599
I just thought maybe we could
track a couple of those, too.

16:17.633 --> 16:18.633
You know, why don't we hold on to those?

16:18.667 --> 16:19.967
Okay, let's focus on that raw,

16:20.001 --> 16:21.402
kind of crazy side of you for this demo.

16:21.437 --> 16:23.671
All right?

16:23.706 --> 16:25.339
Now you free to record tomorrow night?

16:25.373 --> 16:27.073
Uh, yeah. Yeah, man. 100%.

16:27.108 --> 16:29.309
Good. I'll book the session.

16:37.285 --> 16:38.852
Sit.

16:38.886 --> 16:40.919
Good boy.

16:40.954 --> 16:42.187
Impressive.

16:42.222 --> 16:44.490
Yeah.

16:44.524 --> 16:47.092
I hope you don't mind. I let myself in.

16:47.127 --> 16:48.628
You don't have to do that.

16:48.662 --> 16:49.828
No, I know.

16:49.863 --> 16:52.197
No, seriously, don't.

16:52.232 --> 16:55.568
I'm sorry.

16:55.602 --> 16:57.469
I'm sorry I didn't call you.

16:57.503 --> 17:00.037
I'm so...

17:00.072 --> 17:02.607
I just needed a little time.

17:02.642 --> 17:03.841
No, it's all right.

17:03.876 --> 17:05.877
You know, I know that I... was being stupid

17:05.911 --> 17:07.178
and I overreacted.

17:07.212 --> 17:11.316
No. You weren't overreacting.

17:11.349 --> 17:13.684
I don't... what does that mean?

17:13.718 --> 17:15.618
I don't even know how to say this.

17:15.654 --> 17:18.021
Wait.

17:18.055 --> 17:19.890
Are you...

17:22.026 --> 17:24.161
are you ending this with me?

17:24.194 --> 17:26.563
I'm sorry, Stace. Um...

17:26.598 --> 17:30.433
Oh. So I wasn't being paranoid about Rayna.

17:32.369 --> 17:36.839
Did you have sex with her?

17:38.742 --> 17:40.176
It's more than that.

17:40.210 --> 17:42.312
Yeah, no, I get it. I get what it is.

17:42.346 --> 17:45.079
I mean, you actually start
to make a life for yourself,

17:45.114 --> 17:47.316
and then suddenly she just has
to have you back again. That's...

17:47.350 --> 17:49.551
I didn't mean to do this. I didn't wanna...

17:49.585 --> 17:51.186
I'm sorry, Stacey. I didn't...

17:51.220 --> 17:53.388
You know, we could have had something.

17:53.423 --> 17:56.525
We did...

17:56.559 --> 17:59.928
have something, I thought. Just...

17:59.962 --> 18:02.062
Oh, my God.

18:03.699 --> 18:06.500
No, you have to stay, baby.

18:06.535 --> 18:08.202
Stacey, take him.

18:09.805 --> 18:12.239
He'll be a lot better off with you, anyway.

18:12.273 --> 18:15.242
Yeah, you're damn right he will. Come on.

18:15.276 --> 18:17.009
Let's go.

18:32.886 --> 18:35.321
Mm. I do not wanna end up being trashed

18:35.355 --> 18:36.622
on the worst-dressed list.

18:36.656 --> 18:38.389
I need something that is classic.

18:38.424 --> 18:42.293
My assistant's out pulling
bags, shoes, and jewelry.

18:43.562 --> 18:44.596
Can I have another one, please?

18:44.630 --> 18:46.331
Yeah. Can I get anyone anything else?

18:46.365 --> 18:49.134
No, thanks. Just water.

18:49.168 --> 18:51.402
Honey, maybe you oughta
slow down on those mimosas.

18:51.437 --> 18:53.171
You know, you've already had three.

18:53.206 --> 18:56.841
Funny, you never used
to count when you drank.

18:56.875 --> 19:00.510
You know, I know you're
upset about Dante, but...

19:00.545 --> 19:02.179
Mama, I'm having a mimosa, okay?

19:02.214 --> 19:04.181
That's not the kind of
drink that people have

19:04.216 --> 19:05.315
when they're upset.

19:05.350 --> 19:07.218
When they're upset, people drink vodka.

19:08.954 --> 19:12.288
Just 'cause you have a
problem doesn't mean that I do.

19:17.962 --> 19:19.695
Is this a joke?

19:19.730 --> 19:21.497
No, it's my resignation letter.

19:21.531 --> 19:23.900
Yeah, I see that.

19:23.934 --> 19:26.468
What, are you... you still catching heat

19:26.502 --> 19:27.602
over those canceled contracts?

19:27.637 --> 19:29.104
Yes, but that's not the issue here.

19:29.139 --> 19:30.639
All right, look,

19:30.673 --> 19:32.174
you're not on the council anymore.

19:32.208 --> 19:34.042
You don't have to please everyone.

19:34.077 --> 19:35.844
And if you're trying to send a message,

19:35.879 --> 19:37.712
I can make that good in some other way.

19:37.747 --> 19:39.547
It's become clear that the only interests

19:39.582 --> 19:42.483
being served through this office are yours.

19:42.517 --> 19:44.385
Anyway, I'd like to thank
you for the opportunity.

19:44.419 --> 19:46.154
Opportunity?

19:46.188 --> 19:47.554
I took a stand for you publicly.

19:47.589 --> 19:50.291
What has it been, a month? Two?

19:50.325 --> 19:51.458
Why are you doing this now?

19:51.493 --> 19:53.594
Look, you can tell the press

19:53.628 --> 19:55.863
I've gone off to take care of my family.

19:55.898 --> 19:57.431
I don't know what you think
you're accomplishing by this,

19:57.465 --> 19:59.866
but it's not gonna bode well
for your political future.

19:59.901 --> 20:01.968
I can promise you that.

20:02.003 --> 20:03.970
Thank you, Mr. Mayor.

20:11.879 --> 20:13.180
Hey.

20:13.214 --> 20:15.014
Hey.

20:15.048 --> 20:18.050
- You, uh, going off to meet your producer?
- Yep.

20:18.084 --> 20:20.085
You play that song for Scarlett?

20:20.120 --> 20:22.188
Nope.

20:22.222 --> 20:24.556
You ain't gonna tell her it's Jason's?

20:24.590 --> 20:27.226
Sorry, man. That's cool. It's just...

20:27.260 --> 20:28.694
it's between the two of you.

20:28.728 --> 20:29.994
I just thought maybe you're
making more trouble for yourself

20:30.029 --> 20:31.529
by not saying anything. You know what?

20:31.563 --> 20:34.232
I don't need life advice
about my girlfriend, okay?

20:34.266 --> 20:36.667
Hey, guys.

20:36.702 --> 20:37.836
Hey.

20:37.870 --> 20:39.003
Guess what.

20:39.038 --> 20:42.073
We just got invited to the
Edgehill C.M.A. party tonight.

20:42.107 --> 20:45.043
Tonight? Uh, I'm supposed to be recording.

20:45.077 --> 20:47.110
Um... oh, your demo. Oh,
no, that's... that's okay.

20:47.145 --> 20:48.879
Don't worry about it.

20:48.913 --> 20:50.613
You know what? I'll...
I'll push the session, okay?

20:50.648 --> 20:51.815
No, I don't wanna mess up your day.

20:51.850 --> 20:53.717
And you need to record the mystery demo.

20:53.751 --> 20:55.185
No, it is your record label, okay?

20:55.220 --> 20:58.121
And I don't want you to go alone.

20:58.156 --> 20:59.223
I'll go with her.

20:59.257 --> 21:01.091
That could be fun.

21:01.125 --> 21:03.993
Um... as long as it's all right with you?

21:04.027 --> 21:05.328
Yeah.

21:05.362 --> 21:07.263
Yeah, no problem at all. That's fine.

21:07.297 --> 21:09.365
You two have fun, okay?

21:09.399 --> 21:10.466
I gotta go. I'm late.

21:10.500 --> 21:11.800
Okay.

21:13.170 --> 21:15.304
Good luck.

21:15.339 --> 21:17.773
Thanks.

21:17.807 --> 21:21.877
You don't think there's
something bothering him, do you?

21:21.911 --> 21:23.144
Nah.

21:24.914 --> 21:27.883
Okay, so Jennie will be
here tonight with Daphne

21:27.917 --> 21:29.217
- when you bring Maddie home.
- Good. Okay.

21:29.252 --> 21:30.818
'Cause I'm gonna be at the Edgehill...

21:30.853 --> 21:32.420
Right, right. Congratulations, by the way.

21:32.454 --> 21:34.388
Well, thank you.

21:34.422 --> 21:37.457
And I hope that y'all have
a really fun night tonight.

21:37.492 --> 21:39.593
You know, Maddie and I, uh,

21:39.627 --> 21:42.062
- we need some healing in our relationship.
- Yeah.

21:42.097 --> 21:44.398
And, you know, the way I
handled things with Peggy...

21:44.432 --> 21:47.134
I, uh, I know was hurtful to you guys.

21:47.168 --> 21:49.969
And I'm sorry the way
y'all had to find out.

21:51.471 --> 21:55.408
I, you know, if we're...

21:55.442 --> 21:57.777
if we're being honest with each other...

21:59.179 --> 22:01.881
Uh...

22:01.916 --> 22:03.249
Deacon and I might be...

22:03.284 --> 22:05.251
Really?

22:05.286 --> 22:07.619
I don't know. It's very
early. It's a bad idea.

22:07.653 --> 22:09.687
- Oh, okay, I'm so glad that I was honest with you.
- I know you, I know you,

22:09.722 --> 22:11.823
and there is no way you can
be in a relationship with him

22:11.857 --> 22:13.691
- without the truth coming out.
- Excuse me.

22:13.726 --> 22:15.860
Do you have any idea what's at stake?

22:15.895 --> 22:18.096
- Of course I do.
- Close your eyes!

22:20.566 --> 22:22.166
Okay, open.

22:23.568 --> 22:24.635
Wow.

22:24.669 --> 22:26.270
Oh, my gosh.

22:26.305 --> 22:30.140
You look gorgeous, baby.

22:30.174 --> 22:31.541
Oh.

22:31.575 --> 22:33.443
- Oh, I forgot my lip gloss.
- Oh.

22:33.510 --> 22:36.279
Take your time, honey.

22:37.581 --> 22:39.149
Listen...

22:39.183 --> 22:41.617
I am Maddie's father, her only father.

22:41.652 --> 22:43.653
Do not threaten that.

22:43.687 --> 22:47.122
I would never, ever do
anything to hurt her or you.

22:47.157 --> 22:48.523
Just honor the agreement we made

22:48.558 --> 22:50.759
the day our daughter was born,
and if you can't handle that,

22:50.793 --> 22:52.627
then break it off with Deacon right now.

22:59.836 --> 23:01.669
You sure you don't want me
to come with you tonight?

23:01.703 --> 23:03.338
I could stay over.

23:03.372 --> 23:06.640
No. I'm fine. Bo will drive you home.

23:06.675 --> 23:10.378
Besides, mama's practically
moved back in, anyway.

23:10.412 --> 23:13.314
Oh, no.

23:13.349 --> 23:15.483
What?

23:15.517 --> 23:16.717
Nothing that can't wait.

23:16.751 --> 23:19.586
Emily, spill. What?

23:19.587 --> 23:22.356
The security people got the details

23:22.390 --> 23:23.991
on those credit card charges.

23:25.994 --> 23:28.362
What'd Dante buy himself now?

23:28.396 --> 23:31.831
A $17,000 diamond ring.

23:35.068 --> 23:41.374
I'm guessin' that's not for me.

23:46.980 --> 23:48.481
Hi, there. Hi.

23:48.515 --> 23:49.580
Hey. Why don't I meet you in the back?

23:51.783 --> 23:53.173
All right. Yeah. Thank you.

23:54.220 --> 23:56.421
Would you take me to the back?

23:56.422 --> 23:57.889
Hey, y'alll.

23:57.923 --> 23:59.690
Rayna! Juliette! A picture together!

23:59.725 --> 24:00.791
Hey, how are ya?

24:00.826 --> 24:02.093
- Good.
- Good.

24:02.128 --> 24:03.945
How does it feel for
you two touring together,

24:03.946 --> 24:06.096
and now competing in the same category?

24:06.131 --> 24:07.631
Well, if you're expecting a catfight,

24:07.665 --> 24:08.932
you're not gonna get it.

24:08.966 --> 24:10.767
We have a lot of respect for each other.

24:10.801 --> 24:13.137
I think the nomination will
bring us closer together.

24:13.171 --> 24:14.538
I do, too. Mm.

24:14.572 --> 24:17.041
Okay, too close.

24:17.075 --> 24:18.142
Honey, that perfume you're wearing

24:18.176 --> 24:19.476
is 80 proof.

24:19.511 --> 24:22.578
Let's get one last shot
with my leading ladies, huh?

24:22.612 --> 24:23.879
This way, please!

27:59.952 --> 28:01.585
you know, all these cameras around,

we should keep a low profile.

28:07.658 --> 28:09.225
- Tell me. Talk to me.
- You know what, babe?

28:09.259 --> 28:12.696
I just can't... talk to
you about it right now.

28:12.730 --> 28:15.565
- Don't do this again, okay?
- Don't do what again?

28:15.600 --> 28:18.300
- You know, you're pulling away...
- There you are!

28:18.334 --> 28:19.969
Just hold on a second, okay?
You're not talking to me.

28:20.003 --> 28:21.503
You're not, all right? I don't...

28:21.537 --> 28:23.606
Oops, sorry. I got a little
something called a show.

28:23.640 --> 28:25.074
I know what we're doing, all right?

28:25.108 --> 28:26.809
Just go pull yourself together,
and I'll be there in one second.

28:26.843 --> 28:28.243
Thank you.

28:28.277 --> 28:29.745
Rayna, tell me what's wrong.

28:29.779 --> 28:31.046
Babe, I can't.

28:31.081 --> 28:33.414
- You know what?
- Until the end of the leg of this tour,

28:33.448 --> 28:35.049
- you still work for me.
- I just can't right now.

28:35.084 --> 28:36.550
Get your butt down there!

28:36.585 --> 28:38.886
Get out of my way and
do your own damn show.

28:38.921 --> 28:40.121
- Oh, what, you quit?
- Yes!

28:40.155 --> 28:41.923
Well, I quit you!

28:41.957 --> 28:43.424
I am so tired of you!

28:46.629 --> 28:49.663
Well, guys, we have a slight problem.

28:49.697 --> 28:52.065
I have to be on stage in five minutes,

28:52.100 --> 28:54.668
and I'm short a guitar player.

28:54.702 --> 28:56.770
We have people waiting out there...

28:56.804 --> 28:58.972
people who vote.

28:59.007 --> 29:01.008
Anybody?

29:01.042 --> 29:02.475
I can play.

29:02.510 --> 29:04.077

29:04.112 --> 29:05.611

29:05.646 --> 29:07.980
All right, then, well, good.

29:08.015 --> 29:09.649
Somebody get him a guitar.

29:09.683 --> 29:11.582
Oh, and by the way,

29:11.617 --> 29:14.886
I changed my mind about doing the single.

29:14.920 --> 29:18.023
I have something a little more appropriate.

29:18.057 --> 29:21.126

29:21.160 --> 29:23.161

29:30.402 --> 29:32.637
I sure will.

29:32.671 --> 29:35.640

- All right.
