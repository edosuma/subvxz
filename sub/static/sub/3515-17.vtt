WEBVTT

00:01.000 --> 00:02.240
JULIETTE:
Previously on Grimm...

00:02.280 --> 00:03.485
I want you to be my best man.

00:03.560 --> 00:04.846
They're coming to get you.
You're sure?

00:04.920 --> 00:06.160
Viktor is sending Verrat agents

00:06.240 --> 00:07.480
to take you back to the castle.

00:07.560 --> 00:10.370
Viktor wants the child, not you.
Meisner is on his way.

00:10.440 --> 00:11.521
You remember
when I once told you

00:11.600 --> 00:12.567
you would have to choose a side?

00:12.640 --> 00:14.085
Well, this is the time.

00:24.280 --> 00:26.726
HANK: Could be a really
volatile situation.

00:28.240 --> 00:30.607
I think it's a big risk,
and you'd be way outnumbered.

00:31.360 --> 00:32.485
With no backup.

00:32.560 --> 00:35.962
It's not as if you can be
up front about this either.

00:36.200 --> 00:37.486
I could go undercover.

00:37.560 --> 00:40.086
I don't think you
should go at all.

00:40.400 --> 00:41.845
It shouldn't be
this complicated.

00:41.960 --> 00:43.610
Well, it is.
You don't want to wind up

00:43.680 --> 00:46.251
killing Monroe and Rosalee's
friends and family.

00:47.320 --> 00:50.051
I mean, a best man should
really not be doing that.

00:50.320 --> 00:51.481
Right.

00:52.920 --> 00:54.365
You're right.

00:55.320 --> 00:57.440
I'm just gonna have to tell
Monroe it's too dangerous.

00:59.800 --> 01:01.484
How did Wesen even
know you're a Grimm?

01:05.160 --> 01:06.650
I don't really know.

01:08.720 --> 01:10.848
Maybe it's time you found out.

01:33.560 --> 01:34.925
This is it?

01:35.360 --> 01:37.886
Close enough. Our contact
will be meeting us.

01:39.000 --> 01:40.240
Then what?

01:40.600 --> 01:42.125
Then they'll get you
and your child to safety.

01:42.360 --> 01:43.691
Is that even possible?

01:43.920 --> 01:46.207
The Resistance knows
how important both of you are.

01:46.280 --> 01:48.760
Whoever they
picked will be the best.

01:48.840 --> 01:51.286
Stay here. I'll return
once I know it's safe.

01:51.360 --> 01:53.010
What if it isn't?

01:54.040 --> 01:55.405
I won't leave
until I know it is.

01:56.920 --> 01:58.684
Please, be careful.

02:20.560 --> 02:21.560
(MAN SPEAKING GERMAN)

02:21.600 --> 02:23.329
Have a visual.

02:23.400 --> 02:25.050
One male...

02:25.120 --> 02:26.884
...moving towards
your position.

02:28.880 --> 02:29.927
Intercept.

03:19.800 --> 03:21.802
(AIRPLANE APPROACHING)

03:48.520 --> 03:50.443
(AIRPLANE APPROACHING)

04:15.000 --> 04:16.000
(SPEAKING GERMAN)

04:16.079 --> 04:17.081
Get in.

04:17.800 --> 04:18.801
Let's go.

04:36.600 --> 04:37.647
MEISNER: Adalind!

04:42.480 --> 04:43.891
You did this?

04:45.080 --> 04:46.081
I did.

04:48.080 --> 04:49.366
I'll take it from here.

05:27.880 --> 05:30.008
Whoever planned
this did a lousy job.

05:30.080 --> 05:31.969
KELLY: The Verrat were
here three hours ago.

05:32.040 --> 05:33.246
MEISNER: When
did you get here?

05:33.400 --> 05:34.686
KELLY: Fortunately,
before they did.

05:34.760 --> 05:35.727
ADALIND: Where
are you taking me?

05:35.800 --> 05:38.440
We're gonna get in that plane.
That's all you need to know for now.

05:38.600 --> 05:40.523
I want to know where I'm going!

05:40.600 --> 05:42.170
The Verrat know you're here,
so there's gonna be

05:42.240 --> 05:44.368
more of them here soon.
You want to stay?

05:44.440 --> 05:46.727
That's up to you.
I'm leaving.

05:47.760 --> 05:49.649
I don't even know who she is.
She just saved our lives.

05:49.720 --> 05:51.688
I think we can trust her.

06:09.280 --> 06:10.281
We need to leave!

06:10.360 --> 06:11.361
Everything all right?

06:11.440 --> 06:12.487
No, the Verrat were here.

06:12.600 --> 06:13.886
Now?
I said, "were."

06:13.960 --> 06:15.405
Get us off the ground.

06:15.520 --> 06:16.646
Good luck.

06:18.240 --> 06:19.280
If it hadn't been for you,

06:19.320 --> 06:21.084
I'd have been
dead a long time ago.

06:21.160 --> 06:22.844
Come on, let's go.

06:44.600 --> 06:47.490
KELLY: Sit down.
Get buckled in.

06:48.360 --> 06:50.601
Hold on to the baby.
It's gonna be rough.

06:51.840 --> 06:53.126
Is it a girl?

06:53.400 --> 06:54.401
Yes.

07:34.320 --> 07:35.320
Is it done?

07:35.360 --> 07:36.486
MEISNER: The plane
just took off,

07:36.640 --> 07:38.244
but the Verrat
were waiting for us.

07:38.440 --> 07:40.408
Fortunately,
our contact was here first.

07:40.520 --> 07:41.885
RENARD: Anyone hurt?

07:42.040 --> 07:43.451
Six dead, all of them Verrat.

07:43.600 --> 07:44.601
Who was the contact?

07:44.680 --> 07:45.680
I have no idea, but

07:45.720 --> 07:47.245
I'm glad she was on our side.

07:47.520 --> 07:48.567
She?

07:48.640 --> 07:50.404
After seeing what
she did to the Verrat,

07:50.480 --> 07:52.480
Adalind and the child are
definitely in good hands.

07:54.240 --> 07:55.366
Have you heard from Sebastien?

07:55.440 --> 07:57.761
I saw what Prince
Viktor did to him...

07:57.840 --> 07:58.921
It's how they got to us...

07:59.080 --> 08:01.162
But Sebastien made up for it.

08:01.240 --> 08:03.766
Without him, we would have
never gotten this far.

08:03.840 --> 08:05.001
I doubt he's still alive.

08:08.240 --> 08:10.163
I think it'd be best you
disappear for a little while.

08:10.240 --> 08:12.004
I think that's a very good idea.

08:19.400 --> 08:21.448
There should be supplies for us.

08:24.120 --> 08:26.441
Yeah. Food, water,

08:27.440 --> 08:29.408
a few thousand Brazilian Real.

08:31.080 --> 08:32.525
You'll be happy to see these.

08:32.919 --> 08:33.921
Thank God.

08:38.120 --> 08:39.405
You're American.

08:40.720 --> 08:42.289
Are you working
with the Resistance?

08:43.520 --> 08:45.329
The less we know about
each other, the better.

08:47.440 --> 08:50.683
Keep your mind on your baby,
and we'll do just fine.

08:50.800 --> 08:52.370
Look, I don't know who you are,

08:52.440 --> 08:54.283
and I have no idea
if you know who I am,

08:54.360 --> 08:56.442
but I just delivered my baby
in the middle of the woods,

08:56.520 --> 08:58.400
and we've been running
for our lives ever since.

08:58.440 --> 09:00.363
I'm a little tired,
I'm a little hungry,

09:00.440 --> 09:03.728
I'm very sore, and I've seen
a lot of people killed,

09:03.800 --> 09:04.961
so I don't think
it's too much to ask

09:05.040 --> 09:07.088
for a little conversation.

09:08.960 --> 09:11.645
I think you should probably
change her diaper.

09:15.640 --> 09:16.926
Where are we?

09:17.000 --> 09:18.604
At the moment, right about
the middle of France.

09:18.760 --> 09:20.444
And wherein Brazil
are you taking us?

09:21.680 --> 09:22.841
I'm not supposed
to tell you that.

09:22.920 --> 09:24.684
There are six dead
Verrat back in that field

09:24.760 --> 09:26.330
who knew you were coming.

09:26.400 --> 09:29.324
Wherever you're taking us is
probably no longer a secret.

09:29.400 --> 09:31.004
I suggest we don't find out.

09:32.320 --> 09:33.481
So much for Sao Paulo.

09:34.440 --> 09:36.442
I'm afraid there's no plan
I'll have to radio in.

09:36.520 --> 09:37.726
No, no. As long as
we're on this plane,

09:37.800 --> 09:39.450
you don't talk
to anybody but me.

09:40.520 --> 09:43.000
I don't trust anybody
I'm not close enough to kill.

09:44.240 --> 09:45.241
All right.

09:45.840 --> 09:47.171
But we'll need to
make a decision soon.

09:47.240 --> 09:49.242
In 30 minutes,
we'll be off the continent.

09:49.320 --> 09:50.970
How far can we go in this thing?

09:51.040 --> 09:53.850
We have four extra tanks,
so we have a long range.

09:53.920 --> 09:55.331
But if you have
someplace in mind,

09:55.520 --> 09:56.726
now's the time to share it.

10:00.840 --> 10:04.606
I think all we have to do
is ask when they RSVP

10:04.680 --> 10:06.887
if they want to go meatless,
you know, and that way,

10:07.000 --> 10:10.163
we're not stuck with a bunch
of extra eggplant casserole.

10:10.240 --> 10:13.050
That's what we're serving
as our vegetarian dish,

10:13.120 --> 10:14.804
eggplant casserole?

10:14.880 --> 10:17.770
No, no, that was just
a for-instance.

10:17.840 --> 10:19.490
You know, I was actually
thinking more along the lines

10:19.560 --> 10:23.929
of, like, a red curry maybe
with some zucchini and squash,

10:24.000 --> 10:25.650
whatever's in season.

10:26.360 --> 10:27.725
I'll get it.

10:28.440 --> 10:30.721
Hey, we still have to figure
out the seating arrangements.

10:31.200 --> 10:32.645
ROSALEE: I don't want to
wind up with a Mauzhertz

10:32.720 --> 10:34.324
next to a Klaustreich.

10:39.720 --> 10:40.721
We need to talk.

10:42.240 --> 10:43.241
Who's dead?

10:43.640 --> 10:44.641
Nobody.

10:45.760 --> 10:47.046
At least not yet.

10:48.720 --> 10:50.324
Look, I got a problem.

10:50.400 --> 10:52.971
Rosalee, it's Nick.
He's got a problem.

10:53.040 --> 10:57.489
Sorry to interrupt, Rosalee,
but this is kind of important.

10:57.600 --> 11:00.729
Hey, Nick, what's wrong?
What kind of case is it?

11:02.640 --> 11:04.085
It's not a case.

11:04.840 --> 11:05.966
Really?

11:08.960 --> 11:09.961
It's your wedding.

11:10.920 --> 11:11.921
What?

11:16.040 --> 11:17.326
I can't be your best man.

11:17.640 --> 11:19.324
(SIGHS)

11:20.120 --> 11:23.761
lam honored that you asked me,
but it's just too dangerous.

11:23.840 --> 11:25.205
Both of your
families are gonna be there

11:25.280 --> 11:28.807
and, I assume,
Wesen friends of yours.

11:29.640 --> 11:32.211
Now, what if one of them
Woged, saw that I'm a Grimm?

11:32.280 --> 11:34.442
I mean, you saw how
your parents reacted.

11:36.280 --> 11:37.805
I don't want to hurt anybody,

11:37.880 --> 11:40.451
and I don't want anybody
to get hurt because of me.

11:40.520 --> 11:43.364
Our day would be ruined
if you weren't there.

11:43.800 --> 11:45.723
Monroe and I would never
have met without you.

11:45.800 --> 11:47.848
And there's nothing I would
want more than to be there,

11:47.920 --> 11:50.810
but I just don't know
how to make that work.

11:51.800 --> 11:53.529
Sunglasses.

11:53.640 --> 11:55.449
Yes!

11:55.600 --> 11:56.647
I'm sorry, what?

11:56.800 --> 11:57.881
You wear sunglasses.

11:58.960 --> 12:00.246
I don't see how that would help.

12:00.920 --> 12:02.888
It's your eyes.
My eyes?

12:03.000 --> 12:05.321
It's how we know you're
a Grimm after we Woge.

12:06.240 --> 12:07.321
They turn black.

12:07.480 --> 12:08.561
Not exactly black.

12:08.680 --> 12:10.603
MONROE: No, you're right, actually.
Black's too weak a word.

12:10.680 --> 12:12.808
It's more like
infinite darkness.

12:13.520 --> 12:16.444
And we see ourselves reflected
in that darkness.

12:16.520 --> 12:19.364
We see our true Wesen nature.

12:20.000 --> 12:22.162
Took me a while to
get used to that.

12:22.240 --> 12:25.289
Really?
You see that in my eyes?

12:25.360 --> 12:27.488
Yeah, it's
actually very unsettling.

12:27.600 --> 12:30.040
ROSALEE: It explains why you get
some of the reactions you do.

12:30.080 --> 12:31.844
You really didn't know this?

12:32.400 --> 12:33.845
No, I...

12:35.280 --> 12:37.009
Well, I guess
I should've asked sooner.

12:37.080 --> 12:38.525
Do you have your sunglasses?

12:38.640 --> 12:40.005
Yeah.

12:40.080 --> 12:41.445
Put 'em on.
Let's try it out.

12:51.840 --> 12:52.841
You see anything?

12:54.040 --> 12:55.929
Yeah, you just...
Not you.

12:56.160 --> 12:57.321
No, nothing.

12:57.440 --> 12:58.601
Me neither.

13:00.880 --> 13:03.360
There you go! Problem solved.

13:03.480 --> 13:04.481
(MONROE LAUGHS)

13:04.720 --> 13:06.006
Best man.

13:06.760 --> 13:07.761
Woop!

13:19.480 --> 13:21.244
You're sure this is
what you want to do?

13:21.520 --> 13:23.560
Once we're over that water,
there's no turning back.

13:25.400 --> 13:26.561
Do it.

13:43.920 --> 13:45.331
(BABY CRIES)

13:46.600 --> 13:48.170
(CRYING)
It's okay. Shh.

13:48.240 --> 13:50.686
The altitude's building
pressure in her ears.

13:52.200 --> 13:54.328
If you rub just below them,
she'll feel better.

13:54.400 --> 13:55.640
Where?

13:55.760 --> 13:57.000
Just here.

13:57.720 --> 14:01.088
Okay. Okay. Okay.

14:03.520 --> 14:05.568
Not too hard.

14:12.400 --> 14:13.401
That worked.

14:18.720 --> 14:21.371
Not easy figuring
out how to be a mother.

14:22.920 --> 14:24.046
Do you have children?

14:26.400 --> 14:27.640
My sister did.

14:30.520 --> 14:32.682
JULIETTE: You really think
sunglasses will be enough?

14:32.760 --> 14:35.570
They said it works. They
couldn't see me as a Grimm.

14:35.800 --> 14:37.404
Well, if the Wedding's
at night, don't you think

14:37.520 --> 14:38.885
you're gonna look
a little strange?

14:38.960 --> 14:41.281
And what if you
trip and they fall off?

14:41.640 --> 14:42.801
This isn't helping.

14:43.800 --> 14:44.847
Sorry.

14:54.400 --> 14:55.401
Hm.

15:00.440 --> 15:01.441
Hm.

15:02.800 --> 15:03.881
Still there.

15:04.000 --> 15:05.047
Yeah.

15:05.320 --> 15:06.890
Still here.

15:08.480 --> 15:11.689
So am I,
and when the time is right,

15:11.760 --> 15:13.410
we both know where to find it,

15:13.480 --> 15:16.245
but one wedding to worry about
right now is enough,

15:16.480 --> 15:18.528
especially if you have
to whack a few guests.

15:24.840 --> 15:26.524
(KNOCKING)

15:26.880 --> 15:28.086
Come in.

15:33.800 --> 15:35.689
Sir, I would like...
Shut up.

15:40.080 --> 15:41.969
Let me give it a shot.

15:42.680 --> 15:45.160
You feel awful and
take full responsibility

15:45.240 --> 15:47.163
for failing to stop
Adalind and her child

15:47.240 --> 15:49.527
from slipping from your grasp
and getting away,

15:49.600 --> 15:51.204
despite the fact that we had

15:51.280 --> 15:54.011
intercepted communications
from Resistance agents,

15:54.080 --> 15:57.641
which gave you sufficient time
to disrupt their plans.

15:57.720 --> 16:02.965
Not only did you lose the
Royal Child and her mother,

16:03.560 --> 16:05.528
that Herr Meisner has
managed to disappear,

16:05.600 --> 16:09.446
we are left with
another six dead Verrat.

16:12.360 --> 16:13.486
Did I leave anything out?

16:13.560 --> 16:14.607
I...

16:14.680 --> 16:15.680
No need to guess.

16:15.720 --> 16:17.609
Of course I left something out.

16:20.400 --> 16:23.722
Your services to the Royal
Family are no longer required.

16:26.280 --> 16:27.327
But, sir...

16:27.760 --> 16:29.250
VIKTOR: Auf Wiedersehen.
(GROWLING)

16:29.800 --> 16:32.087
(SCREAMING)

16:42.560 --> 16:45.040
It's tough raising a baby
when you're on the run.

16:46.480 --> 16:48.926
I guess I should thank you
for saving our lives.

16:50.120 --> 16:51.281
Your life, maybe.

16:52.600 --> 16:54.443
The Royal Families would have
never killed the child.

16:54.520 --> 16:55.885
They want it too badly.

16:57.200 --> 16:59.202
Not so much me, I guess.

17:02.440 --> 17:04.407
Plan on keeping her?
Excuse me?

17:04.480 --> 17:05.720
As long as you have that child,

17:05.800 --> 17:07.404
they won't stop
trying to find you.

17:08.440 --> 17:10.840
I won't let
anyone take my child.

17:11.280 --> 17:13.362
They'll have to kill me first.

17:15.280 --> 17:17.362
Now you sound like a mother.

17:21.119 --> 17:23.122
When's the last time you slept?

17:23.200 --> 17:24.201
I don't know.

17:24.560 --> 17:25.560
Why don't you try
to get some now?

17:25.640 --> 17:27.243
Come on, I can hold her.

17:29.120 --> 17:31.930
We're on a plane. There's
no place for me to go.

17:35.360 --> 17:36.646
Thank you.

17:48.000 --> 17:49.764
KELLY: Hello. Hi.

17:50.480 --> 17:52.847
Gonna rest now.
Gonna sleep.

17:54.320 --> 17:56.209
Get some sleep.

17:57.720 --> 17:59.688
(HUMMING)

18:06.040 --> 18:08.646
I've got something. Yeah.

18:10.680 --> 18:11.966
What is this?

18:13.840 --> 18:15.126
What is it?

18:16.160 --> 18:17.650
What do I have?

18:34.680 --> 18:36.240
What the bloody hell
was that all about?

19:08.320 --> 19:09.765
Senor Rispoli.

19:09.880 --> 19:11.370
Sir.

19:12.400 --> 19:14.721
I trust you saw
Danilov on his way out.

19:15.600 --> 19:16.601
Come in.

19:18.760 --> 19:21.491
I've heard good things about
you from several sources,

19:21.560 --> 19:23.240
which is why you are
taking Danilov's place

19:23.280 --> 19:24.884
as head of the Verrat.

19:26.840 --> 19:27.841
Thank you, sir.

19:29.920 --> 19:32.002
The Resistance has managed
to get Adalind Schade

19:32.080 --> 19:33.525
and her child away from us.

19:33.840 --> 19:35.922
It's your job to find them.

19:36.160 --> 19:38.811
I am placing every resource
we have at your disposal.

19:38.880 --> 19:41.042
It is imperative that you
find them immediately.

19:41.200 --> 19:44.522
I don't care who you have
to bribe, threaten, or kill.

19:45.600 --> 19:46.931
Any questions?

19:49.160 --> 19:50.321
No, sir.

19:50.680 --> 19:52.921
Danilov failed us.

19:55.120 --> 19:56.565
I won't.

19:59.160 --> 20:00.730
Find that Child.

20:12.680 --> 20:14.808
KELLY: Not easy figuring
out how to be a mother.

20:15.680 --> 20:16.886
ADALIND: Do you have children?

20:17.000 --> 20:18.240
KELLY: My sister did.

20:36.560 --> 20:39.006
Nicky, it's time to go.
Aunt Marie's here.

20:39.800 --> 20:41.211
It won't fit.

20:43.360 --> 20:44.691
You can't take everything.

20:47.160 --> 20:48.924
Why do I have to go?

20:49.600 --> 20:51.364
We talked about this.

20:52.600 --> 20:54.523
It won't be that long.

20:55.240 --> 20:57.129
Come on. Nicky, go.

21:00.600 --> 21:01.840
Ready for a little adventure?

21:02.120 --> 21:03.565
I guess. Where are we going?

21:03.680 --> 21:05.887
Well, that's a surprise.

21:08.440 --> 21:10.568
I'm not sure
that this is such a good idea.

21:10.640 --> 21:12.847
I don't think we have time
for a better one.

21:13.640 --> 21:15.005
Yeah.

21:16.680 --> 21:19.968
You do whatever
Aunt Marie tells you.

21:21.520 --> 21:24.046
And you remember how much
your Dad and I love you.

21:24.520 --> 21:25.760
Okay.

21:29.480 --> 21:31.050
We really should go.

21:31.120 --> 21:32.690
Okay.

21:35.520 --> 21:36.726
Bye, Mom.

21:38.200 --> 21:39.281
Bye, Nicky.

21:57.400 --> 22:00.085
PILOT: I managed to find a couple
of old airfields on the computer.

22:00.200 --> 22:01.486
I have no idea what
condition they're in

22:01.560 --> 22:03.562
or if anyone's using them.
We're low on fuel.

22:03.920 --> 22:06.446
And I can't refuel here, but
I'll get you as close as I can.

22:06.520 --> 22:07.567
Thanks.

22:11.800 --> 22:13.404
We're about to land.
Get ready.

22:37.080 --> 22:39.128
(AIRPLANE APPROACHING)

23:11.080 --> 23:13.242
Did you get out of that plane?

23:13.320 --> 23:14.765
Can you give us a ride?

23:14.880 --> 23:16.325
What are you doing out here?

23:16.400 --> 23:18.482
Please, we need your help.

23:18.560 --> 23:21.006
The only help you're gonna
get is from the sheriff.

23:24.960 --> 23:26.166
ADALIND: Oregon?

23:30.280 --> 23:32.089
KELLY: Don't do that.

23:33.840 --> 23:35.490
Get in.

24:11.640 --> 24:13.240
SALESWOMAN: You would
look great in that.

24:14.360 --> 24:15.407
Thank you.

24:16.000 --> 24:17.160
When are you getting married?

24:17.280 --> 24:19.726
Oh... No, I...

24:20.640 --> 24:21.641
(GASPS)

24:26.240 --> 24:28.561
SALESWOMAN: Looks like alterations
won't be needed after all.

24:28.640 --> 24:29.641
Thanks.

24:29.720 --> 24:31.324
You think my
grandma's dress fits?

24:31.400 --> 24:32.640
Absolutely.

24:32.720 --> 24:35.041
The silhouette's perfect.

24:35.160 --> 24:38.004
What do you think?
It's not too "not me," is it?

24:38.160 --> 24:40.242
No, I think you
look so beautiful.

24:40.880 --> 24:42.120
Really?

24:42.240 --> 24:43.401
Stunning.

24:43.600 --> 24:44.647
What she said.

24:47.080 --> 24:51.483
Okay, then I guess...
I guess...

24:51.560 --> 24:53.164
Oh, my god!

24:53.360 --> 24:55.089
Is this really me?

24:55.720 --> 24:59.486
Will you stop? It's not like
you're gonna wear this everyday.

24:59.600 --> 25:01.762
Yeah, you're right.

25:01.840 --> 25:03.569
Okay.

25:05.600 --> 25:06.601
(GIGGLING)

25:11.560 --> 25:13.642
You're taking us to Portland.

25:14.440 --> 25:17.205
You're working with Sean Renard.

25:17.880 --> 25:19.723
I don't know who that is.

25:19.920 --> 25:22.207
He's with the Resistance.
He must have set this up.

25:22.320 --> 25:24.129
Nobody set this up but me.

25:26.840 --> 25:28.001
Then where are we going?

25:29.640 --> 25:32.041
Someplace I know you'll be safe.

25:40.240 --> 25:41.480
Sir?

25:43.640 --> 25:45.483
Sir?
What?

25:45.560 --> 25:47.881
I have information
about the plane.

25:47.960 --> 25:51.407
Based on our contact in the
générale de I'Aviation civile,

25:51.480 --> 25:53.323
a plane matching its
description was tracked

25:53.400 --> 25:55.641
leaving French
airspace at 7:50 AM.

25:55.960 --> 25:57.962
Heading due west
over the Atlantic.

25:58.240 --> 25:59.765
Seven hours later,
it was picked up

25:59.840 --> 26:03.606
by civil aviation in Canada,
still heading west.

26:04.400 --> 26:06.004
Where is it now?

26:06.800 --> 26:11.124
Civil aviation lost contact
somewhere over Manitoba.

26:12.000 --> 26:14.241
They were flying extremely low,

26:14.320 --> 26:16.926
staying out of
controlled airspace.

26:17.520 --> 26:19.249
Those pilots know
what they're doing.

26:19.520 --> 26:20.931
Why did no one stop them?

26:21.240 --> 26:22.480
The influence of the Resistance

26:22.640 --> 26:23.846
has spread
farther than we thought.

26:24.000 --> 26:25.764
Well,
they had to land somewhere.

26:26.520 --> 26:29.490
We're checking west of Manitoba,
from Alaska to Mexico.

26:29.680 --> 26:31.569
The Resistance could have
taken them anywhere.

26:31.680 --> 26:33.364
Why go all this way?

26:33.440 --> 26:34.771
Sir?

26:35.560 --> 26:38.484
Maybe it's Adalind.

26:40.200 --> 26:42.646
VIKTOR: Maybe
she wanted to go home.

26:50.800 --> 26:52.290
Is this it?

26:52.520 --> 26:54.887
We walk from here.

26:55.200 --> 26:57.726
You want me to take my baby
out in this?

26:58.000 --> 26:59.604
Come on.

27:00.360 --> 27:02.522
We can't sit here
in a stolen truck.

27:02.640 --> 27:04.404
I'll cover you with this.

27:07.400 --> 27:09.050

27:15.400 --> 27:16.401

Oh, God.

27:25.560 --> 27:26.800
ADALIND: This coat smells.

27:26.920 --> 27:28.251
KELLY: You'll live.

27:31.160 --> 27:32.650
Is it much further?

27:32.720 --> 27:34.165
Nearly there.

27:35.240 --> 27:37.402
Nick, dinner's ready.
What are you doing?

27:37.480 --> 27:38.481
NICK: Procrastinating!

27:38.560 --> 27:40.881
Well, stop it and get down here.

27:56.080 --> 27:57.923
Okay, there's some steps here.

27:59.280 --> 28:01.442
See 'em?
Mmm-hmm.

28:07.840 --> 28:09.444
Looking great.

28:09.560 --> 28:11.130
Really? Spaghetti?

28:11.520 --> 28:13.284
No, I was talking about you.

28:14.800 --> 28:15.961
What's going on?

28:16.400 --> 28:18.129
It's funny you should ask.

28:19.400 --> 28:20.606
Because I was thinking that

28:22.200 --> 28:26.603
now is as good
a time as ever to...

28:28.000 --> 28:29.604
To...

28:48.920 --> 28:50.604
Shut the door.

There's a lot
I've got to tell you.

28:55.680 --> 28:57.648
What's going on?

28:58.000 --> 28:59.081
Juliette.

28:59.160 --> 29:01.481
Who's this?
This is my mom.

29:01.880 --> 29:03.370
Your mom. Kelly.

29:04.800 --> 29:06.040
Oh, God!

29:06.520 --> 29:07.726
No, no, no, no, no,
you're safe here.

29:07.800 --> 29:09.450
This is my son, Nick.

29:13.280 --> 29:14.930
Oh, my God.

29:18.680 --> 29:20.648
Protect me? He won't
protect me, he'll kill me.

29:20.720 --> 29:21.881
No, no!
Why did you bring her here?

29:21.960 --> 29:23.883
And you're his mother?
You know her?

29:23.960 --> 29:25.640
She's the one who put
Juliette in the coma.

29:25.680 --> 29:26.727
Adalind.

29:26.800 --> 29:28.450
She's that Hexenbiest?
Why did you bring her here?

29:28.520 --> 29:30.204
I'm not staying here.

29:30.280 --> 29:31.760
No, no, no,
you're not going anywhere.

29:31.800 --> 29:32.800
No, she can't stay!

29:32.840 --> 29:33.841
No way!

29:33.920 --> 29:34.967
No, you don't understand.

29:35.040 --> 29:36.451
And what are you doing with her?

29:36.520 --> 29:39.205
I was recruited by the
Resistance to get her to safety.

29:39.400 --> 29:42.370
Safety? Why would you want
to bring her to safety?

29:42.520 --> 29:44.887
I didn't know who she was,
only that she and the baby

29:44.960 --> 29:46.485
had to be protected at all cost.

29:46.560 --> 29:48.244
What is so valuable about her?

29:49.760 --> 29:51.444
Her child.

29:52.880 --> 29:54.962
The Verrat were waiting for
them outside of Zurich.

29:55.040 --> 29:57.122
The Royals want this child.

29:57.560 --> 29:59.289
If I stay here, he'll kill me.

29:59.400 --> 30:01.129
As if I don't
have a good reason.

30:01.200 --> 30:03.931
You poisoned Juliette. You
tried to kill my Aunt Marie.

You tried to kill my sister?

JULIETTE: What is to stop
her from killing us?

30:07.680 --> 30:09.728
That was a hell of a coma
you put me in, bitch.

I could have died,
and by the way,

30:12.240 --> 30:13.969
I know what's going on now.

30:14.080 --> 30:16.765
If she needs to be protected,
it is not gonna happen here.

30:16.840 --> 30:19.411
What are you gonna do, Nick?
Are you gonna kill me?

30:19.480 --> 30:22.563
And my baby?
Is that what you're gonna do?

30:22.680 --> 30:24.569
(RUMBLING)

30:32.840 --> 30:33.841
What was that?

30:35.600 --> 30:37.682
That was the baby.

She's hungry. I haven't had
a chance to feed her.

30:42.960 --> 30:45.440
The blanket's wet.
She's cold.

30:47.080 --> 30:49.082
This is about the baby.
It's not about you.

30:49.560 --> 30:51.050
You need to get her warmed up.

30:51.160 --> 30:53.845
If you care about her at all,
you're gonna do what I say.

30:53.920 --> 30:55.968
We need to get her dry.
Follow me.

30:57.520 --> 30:58.521

I don't.

30:59.680 --> 31:02.445
But the baby's gonna get sick
if we don't do something.

31:09.280 --> 31:10.964
It's good to see you, Mom.

31:11.040 --> 31:13.964
Nick, I'm sorry.
I had no idea who she was.

31:14.040 --> 31:16.042
When Tavitian contacted me
about this job...

31:16.120 --> 31:17.281
Who's Tavitian?

31:17.640 --> 31:19.290
One of the leaders
of the Resistance.

31:19.360 --> 31:22.091
They wanted her and the baby
protected from the Royals.

31:22.160 --> 31:23.605
Believe me,
if I'd known who she was,

31:23.680 --> 31:25.603
I never would have
brought her here.

31:25.680 --> 31:28.081
Well, I guess she doesn't know
who you are either,

31:28.160 --> 31:29.969
since you killed her mother.

31:31.040 --> 31:34.442
Right, yeah.
I'd forgotten about that.

31:39.520 --> 31:41.010
(GROANING)

31:53.200 --> 31:54.725
You know what,
just for the record,

31:54.800 --> 31:57.007
I didn't actually kill her.
She impaled herself.

31:58.080 --> 32:00.321
I'm not sure Adalind's gonna
care how it happened.

32:01.160 --> 32:03.288
Well, obviously
she doesn't know, and

32:03.400 --> 32:04.526
we'll keep it that way.

32:05.400 --> 32:09.644
Mom, this is crazy.
She cannot stay here.

32:09.760 --> 32:12.127
You don't understand
the importance of that child.

32:12.360 --> 32:14.647
You're right, I don't.
Maybe you should tell me.

32:14.920 --> 32:17.321
This child is
only a few days old,

32:17.400 --> 32:20.210
and already her powers
are beginning to show.

32:22.200 --> 32:23.611
Yeah, so I notice.

32:23.800 --> 32:24.801
Mmm.

32:25.200 --> 32:28.204
Sorry, sorry,
it's just been a while.

32:30.520 --> 32:32.841
She's warm now. There's a blanket
on that chair over there.

32:32.920 --> 32:34.410
Get it and put it on the bed.

32:42.760 --> 32:44.250
Here we go.

32:46.440 --> 32:47.885
How old is she?

32:48.720 --> 32:51.405
I think it's been about 10 days.

32:53.200 --> 32:54.770
What's her name?

32:58.400 --> 32:59.845
You haven't named her yet?

33:01.240 --> 33:03.000
There were too many people
trying to kill us.

33:03.040 --> 33:05.646
I just haven't had the chance
to think about it.

33:07.680 --> 33:08.886
Okay.

33:12.040 --> 33:13.769
You're exhausted.

33:15.360 --> 33:17.442
Here, hold her like that.

33:17.520 --> 33:19.488
What about Nick?
He wants me dead.

33:20.160 --> 33:23.607
If he did, he would've done it
the last time you were here.

33:23.960 --> 33:26.008
Why are you helping me?

33:26.680 --> 33:28.842
(BABY CRIES OUT)

33:30.760 --> 33:33.604
You should feed her
before she gets upset again.

33:45.560 --> 33:48.245
So the child's
father is a Royal,

33:48.320 --> 33:50.163
so her powers have to come from
Adalind, which makes sense,

33:50.240 --> 33:51.969
because her mother
was a Hexenbiest too.

33:52.040 --> 33:53.087
It can't be Adalind.

33:54.000 --> 33:55.889
Her powers are gone.
I took them away from her.

33:56.080 --> 33:57.969
With the blood of a Grimm?

33:59.000 --> 34:00.968
(MOANING)

34:08.520 --> 34:11.569
Yeah, and it hurt.
(CHUCKLES)

34:11.639 --> 34:13.802
Well, she must
have gotten 'em back.

34:14.120 --> 34:15.770
Are you kidding me?
They can do that?

34:15.840 --> 34:16.966
Yes.

34:17.120 --> 34:18.281
Who can do what?

34:18.360 --> 34:21.489
A Hexenbiest who has lost
its powers can regain them.

34:21.719 --> 34:22.846
Now it makes sense.

34:22.920 --> 34:23.920
Really?

34:23.960 --> 34:26.088
It's why her baby is so special.

34:26.320 --> 34:29.164
Nick took Adalind's powers,
but while she was pregnant,

34:29.280 --> 34:32.170
she must have gone through
Contaminatio Ritualis.

34:32.400 --> 34:33.606
Contaminatio Ritualis?

34:33.719 --> 34:34.926
For what it's worth,

34:35.000 --> 34:37.367
it's supposed to be
a long and painful experience

34:37.440 --> 34:38.771
that restored her powers.

34:38.840 --> 34:40.251
You gotta be kidding me.

34:40.320 --> 34:41.446
Listen to me, both of you.

34:41.719 --> 34:44.963
This child has
an extraordinary destiny.

34:45.040 --> 34:46.768
In the wrong hands,
it could do great evil.

34:46.840 --> 34:49.650
But in the right hands,
it could do great good.

34:50.000 --> 34:54.005
So we're talking, like, "changing the
course of history" kind of a person.

34:55.040 --> 34:56.610
Look, I know how it sounds,

34:56.679 --> 34:59.286
but personalities appear in
the world who people follow.

34:59.360 --> 35:01.362
There's no rational
explanation why.

35:01.680 --> 35:03.523
Maybe it's not a coincidence
that you brought Adalind

35:03.600 --> 35:05.284
and her baby back here to Nick.

35:05.840 --> 35:06.840
I'm sorry, what?

35:06.880 --> 35:07.960
Carl Jung... Synchronicity.

35:08.000 --> 35:11.721
When two or more events aren't
necessarily causally related

35:11.800 --> 35:13.404
but are connected
through meaning.

35:15.000 --> 35:16.525
I don't care how
this is connected.

35:16.640 --> 35:17.971
If Adalind has her powers back,

35:18.040 --> 35:19.610
she's not gonna be
doing that kid any good,

35:19.720 --> 35:22.166
so as far as I'm concerned,
the sooner we get her

35:22.240 --> 35:25.164
and her destiny
to the Resistance, the better.

35:25.320 --> 35:28.085
Nick,
that's not gonna work either.

35:29.200 --> 35:31.520
Mom, you've been doing this
whole thing for the Resistance.

35:31.560 --> 35:34.723
The child can't belong to
the Resistance or the Royals.

35:34.880 --> 35:37.121
She has to have
a normal childhood,

35:37.200 --> 35:38.725
in as much as that's possible.

35:40.000 --> 35:41.650
How she is raised will
make all the difference

35:41.720 --> 35:44.007
in who she becomes.

35:44.720 --> 35:47.929
That means Adalind
and the baby stay here

35:48.040 --> 35:50.441
until I can figure out
what to do with them.

35:53.400 --> 35:54.481
That's what you
were trying to tell us

35:54.560 --> 35:56.483
when you sent us that email
that you were headed north

35:56.560 --> 35:58.403
to meet with the Laufer.
Yes.

35:58.520 --> 36:00.841
(SLAMMING)

36:03.480 --> 36:05.005
What the hell?

36:05.080 --> 36:06.081
Adalind.

36:06.600 --> 36:08.204
Adalind?

36:09.120 --> 36:10.849
She's gone.
She left her baby?

36:10.920 --> 36:12.968
What is wrong with her?

36:15.920 --> 36:16.967
Um...

36:17.640 --> 36:18.880
Nick?

36:21.520 --> 36:22.931
Well, I didn't see that coming.

36:23.000 --> 36:24.889
I told you that
baby was powerful.

36:24.960 --> 36:26.246
We have to get them back.

36:26.360 --> 36:27.600
Where would she go?

36:28.240 --> 36:29.366
The truck.

36:55.880 --> 36:57.450
This is where I left it.

36:57.560 --> 36:59.608
Did you kill the driver?

37:00.480 --> 37:01.641
Why would I do that?

37:01.760 --> 37:02.841
Just checking.

37:03.120 --> 37:05.964
He would have reported it stolen by now.
It'll be in the system.

37:06.040 --> 37:08.042
If Adalind's arrested, the
Verrat will know she's here.

37:08.160 --> 37:09.730
We have to find her first.

37:09.800 --> 37:12.041
I don't know how we're gonna do that.
She could be heading anywhere.

37:12.120 --> 37:13.963
When we were driving, she
asked if I was working here

37:14.040 --> 37:16.611
with someone named Renard,
or Raynard or...

37:16.680 --> 37:17.920
Sean Renard?

37:18.000 --> 37:20.241
Yeah, that's it.
You know him?

37:20.320 --> 37:22.129
Yeah, I know him.
He's my captain.

37:22.360 --> 37:24.089
KELLY: This just keeps
getting better.

37:24.160 --> 37:25.800
NICK: And he's the Royal
here in Portland.

37:25.840 --> 37:27.524
What?
Don't get me started.

37:27.680 --> 37:29.682
How well does he know Adalind?

37:29.800 --> 37:31.370
I'd say pretty well.

37:31.480 --> 37:33.528
And by the way,
he's a Zauberbiest.

37:33.840 --> 37:35.126
That's where she's going.

37:37.320 --> 37:38.924
(INTERCOM BUZZES)

37:46.400 --> 37:47.481
Yeah?

37:47.560 --> 37:49.289
MAN: Mr. Renard, there is
a woman here to see you.

37:49.360 --> 37:51.727
Her name is Ada/ind Schade.

37:57.120 --> 37:58.963
Renard admitted to
trying to kill my sister?

37:59.040 --> 38:00.849
Yeah. And he had the key.

38:01.000 --> 38:02.286
How did he get the key?

38:02.400 --> 38:03.640
I hid it in my desk

38:03.760 --> 38:05.360
thinking that
the safest place to keep it

38:05.400 --> 38:06.960
would be the middle
of a police station.

38:07.000 --> 38:09.241
That was before I
knew who he was.

38:09.480 --> 38:11.130
And did you get it back?

38:11.200 --> 38:13.362
Yes, he gave it to me.

38:14.040 --> 38:15.041
Excuse me?

38:15.120 --> 38:18.727
It's safe now. Look, all I'm saying is, it's
not as simple as you think with this guy.

38:19.400 --> 38:21.209
He's covered for me,
more than once.

38:21.480 --> 38:22.970
That's because he
wants you on his side.

38:23.040 --> 38:24.405
But he's working
with the Resistance.

38:24.480 --> 38:25.527
Aren't you doing the same thing?

38:25.640 --> 38:26.680
There's a huge difference.

38:26.800 --> 38:29.963
I'm not in this for myself.
He's got too many strings.

38:30.200 --> 38:33.602
Royal blood, Zauberbiest.
He cannot be trusted.

38:34.080 --> 38:36.082
I don't trust him.

38:36.160 --> 38:37.650
I just think it's better
that I know what he's up to.

38:38.040 --> 38:39.849
Same goes for him, you know.

38:39.960 --> 38:41.246
There it is.

38:53.720 --> 38:55.324
Does Renard live nearby?

38:55.440 --> 38:57.090
NICK: 16th floor.

38:59.760 --> 39:01.728
Hey, where are you going?
I've been here before.

39:01.800 --> 39:02.801
Mom!

39:12.480 --> 39:13.925
Is she all right?

39:14.000 --> 39:17.482
I think so.
She's better than I am.

39:20.280 --> 39:21.691
How'd you get here?

39:21.760 --> 39:23.603
Where's the woman who's
supposed to be protecting you?

39:23.680 --> 39:25.523
That's an interesting story.

39:25.600 --> 39:28.206
Turns out that woman
is Nick's mother.

39:28.320 --> 39:30.561
What?
Imagine my surprise.

39:31.200 --> 39:32.725
Did she know who you were?

39:32.800 --> 39:35.610
If she had, she wouldn't have
taken me to Nick's house.

39:37.200 --> 39:39.009
Imagine their surprise.

39:41.240 --> 39:42.446
NICK: Mom, what are you doing?

39:42.520 --> 39:43.806
I'm going to get that baby.

39:43.880 --> 39:45.564
What, you're just gonna
walk in there and take it?

39:45.640 --> 39:46.880
It's not gonna be that easy.

39:46.960 --> 39:49.964
Mom, listen to me. We need
to think this through.

39:50.200 --> 39:52.009
Thinking is gonna
get in the way, Nick.

39:52.080 --> 39:54.651
If you go after that child,
Renard will kill you.

39:54.880 --> 39:56.405
Not if I kill him first.

39:57.440 --> 39:58.646
Mom. Mom, stop!

39:59.280 --> 40:01.328
You can't just go up
there and kill him.

40:01.400 --> 40:04.404
I'm not gonna kill him.
Not if I don't have to.

40:04.480 --> 40:06.448
You have to let me
talk to him first.

40:06.520 --> 40:07.931
And how is that gonna go?

40:08.000 --> 40:09.843
"You're a half-Royal,
bastard Zauberbiest,

40:09.920 --> 40:11.604
"and your little girlfriend
there is a Hexenbiest,

40:11.720 --> 40:13.484
"and I am a Grimm,
so give me the baby."

40:13.560 --> 40:15.005
That's gonna go
over really well.

40:15.160 --> 40:16.764
Well,
I don't expect it to be easy.

40:16.880 --> 40:19.167
Nick, I'm sorry I brought you back
into this. If I'd known that the...

40:19.240 --> 40:20.401
You didn't.

40:20.520 --> 40:21.885
And there's nothing
we can do about it now,

40:21.960 --> 40:24.008
but I just think we have to be
a little more tactful

40:24.080 --> 40:26.401
than, you know, the usual.

40:27.200 --> 40:28.531
What are you gonna tell them?

40:29.640 --> 40:33.531
I'll tell him it's too dangerous for
Adalind and the baby to live with him.

40:34.240 --> 40:36.322
And it's not like
he can just suddenly

40:36.440 --> 40:38.442
have a family and
nobody take notice.

40:38.520 --> 40:40.124
The Royals will figure this out.

40:40.200 --> 40:42.328
Your captain might not be
interested in what a Grimm thinks.

40:42.400 --> 40:43.731
He might just want to kill you.

40:43.840 --> 40:45.285
Yeah, well, I don't think
he wants to be on the run

40:45.360 --> 40:46.361
for the rest of his life.

40:47.640 --> 40:49.369
Plus, I mean,
you're here, and I'm sure

40:49.440 --> 40:50.805
he's figured that out by now.

40:50.880 --> 40:52.166
All right.

40:52.240 --> 40:54.288
But I'm not gonna
wait here all night.

40:56.520 --> 40:57.521
Hey, Mom.

41:00.880 --> 41:02.291
I'm glad you're okay.

41:02.360 --> 41:03.600
You too.

41:13.040 --> 41:14.326
You want to hold her?

41:27.080 --> 41:28.923
Say, "hi" to your daddy.

41:36.160 --> 41:37.685
Hi.
