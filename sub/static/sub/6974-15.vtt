WEBVTT

00:02.068 --> 00:06.596
Once up a time, there were three -
how shall l put this? - geeks.

00:06.673 --> 00:10.609
Three more unlikely heroes there never were.

00:13.680 --> 00:16.808
We defend the defenseless.
l don't see any other way.

00:16.883 --> 00:20.546
lt wasn't long before their naiveté
nearly got them killed,

00:20.653 --> 00:22.951
so they hooked up with an FBl agent...

00:23.023 --> 00:26.015
That's why we like you.
Your ideas are weirder than ours.

00:26.126 --> 00:29.994
and began publishing a - what shall
l call it? - rag called The Lone Gunman.

00:30.063 --> 00:34.124
The guys at the NSA and the ClA tremble
every time we put out one of these babies.

00:34.200 --> 00:39.399
From their cramped basement office,
they pointed fingers at powerful evil forces.

00:39.506 --> 00:41.633
And some not so evil.

00:41.708 --> 00:46.077
ln their own unique way, the three Gunmen
were patriots, fighting the good fight.

00:46.179 --> 00:50.343
- We tell the stories others refuse to tell.
- That's one way to put it.

00:50.717 --> 00:55.848
And provided expertise
for their friends at the FBl.

00:56.222 --> 00:57.314
She's hot.

00:57.390 --> 01:02.384
For a brief time, it looked as if they might
make a difference in this cold, cruel world.

01:02.495 --> 01:05.055
They acquired an intern
who believed in them.

01:05.165 --> 01:08.498
Let's fight for lost causes. l wanna help.

01:08.568 --> 01:12.504
And a powerful, beautiful nemesis,

01:12.572 --> 01:15.166
who became an ally.

01:15.241 --> 01:17.709
But the world is not kind to idealists,

01:17.777 --> 01:22.771
and those who fight the good fight
don't always win.

02:36.356 --> 02:38.449
Morris.

02:39.359 --> 02:41.987
Morris, it's going ''ping.''

02:42.095 --> 02:44.461
lt most certainly is.

02:46.032 --> 02:47.590
Ping.

02:47.667 --> 02:50.033
You're gonna make me spill.

02:51.771 --> 02:57.505
- Morris, what is all that stuff anyway?
- Don't make me talk shop. lt is so boring.

02:57.610 --> 02:59.339
But l wanna know.

03:00.980 --> 03:02.845
All right.

03:03.883 --> 03:06.818
Where do l begin?

03:06.886 --> 03:09.013
We're in the Bermuda Triangle.

03:09.122 --> 03:14.492
That place where all those planes
and ships have mysteriously disappeared.

03:14.561 --> 03:19.726
- Who named it the Bermuda Triangle?
- Wait. You?

03:19.799 --> 03:24.065
Yeah. That was in my former life,
before l joined the private sector.

03:24.170 --> 03:28.732
There are things l can't talk about
owing to national security, but l will say this:

03:28.808 --> 03:32.005
there are powerful forces out here.

03:32.078 --> 03:37.641
Primal, otherworldly forces,
hidden beneath the waves,

03:37.717 --> 03:41.175
just waiting to be plucked by man.

03:42.155 --> 03:45.181
Somebody's coming.

03:54.000 --> 03:57.401
Whatever you're selling,
we don't want any. No ganja.

03:57.503 --> 04:00.734
Whoa. Wait.

04:00.840 --> 04:04.537
You want the girl?
l can dig it. l'm down with that.

04:05.678 --> 04:10.843
Wait, guys. This is a rental.
There's a $15,000 deposit on this.

04:14.854 --> 04:18.551
Your employer wanted me to tell you,

04:19.559 --> 04:22.027
you're fired.

05:25.692 --> 05:28.183
- Morris Fletcher?
- Finally.

05:28.261 --> 05:32.789
What took you so long? You must be Reyes.

05:32.865 --> 05:37.199
Yeah. Mr Fletcher, we've been told
you requested us by name.

05:37.270 --> 05:39.135
We're very curious about that.

05:39.205 --> 05:43.335
You two head the FBl's
X-Files unit, do you not?

05:43.409 --> 05:46.071
l thought you'd appreciate
what l have to offer.

05:46.179 --> 05:48.704
Which is?

05:48.815 --> 05:51.716
You have no idea
who you're sitting here with, do you?

05:51.818 --> 05:55.811
A guy who's up fudge creek
for violating the Federal Secrets Act.

05:55.888 --> 06:01.349
l've got top security clearance. l'm meant to
check in every month with my ex-employer.

06:01.427 --> 06:04.863
So l skipped a few phone calls. Big deal.

06:04.931 --> 06:07.559
Let me give you a hint.

06:07.667 --> 06:10.761
l used to work at Groom Lake, Nevada.

06:12.939 --> 06:15.373
Area 51?

06:17.276 --> 06:21.940
l was a man in black. The men in black.
What? You've never heard of us?

06:22.048 --> 06:24.243
- l saw the movie.
- Yeah, well.

06:24.350 --> 06:27.717
There are a lot of technical inaccuracies
in that thing.

06:27.787 --> 06:30.722
Anyway, l'm ready to make a deal.

06:33.459 --> 06:37.919
- What deal would that be?
- The one that saves my furry pink ass.

06:38.030 --> 06:41.124
People are trying to kill me.
Did you hear about my boat?

06:41.234 --> 06:44.362
Your female companion
told us what she witnessed.

06:44.437 --> 06:48.373
My fem...? You mean they didn't kill...

06:50.643 --> 06:53.134
- Brittany?
- Brittany.

06:53.246 --> 06:56.909
Thank God she's still alive.
l need protection.

06:56.983 --> 07:01.943
l need to get outta here.
You scratch my back, l'll scratch yours.

07:02.054 --> 07:07.082
l can give you guys the keys to the kingdom -
UFOs, aliens, the whole 50-year cover-up.

07:07.160 --> 07:09.993
- l was there for all of it.
- Tell me, Mr Fletcher,

07:10.096 --> 07:12.894
these documents of yours,

07:12.965 --> 07:16.731
are they indicative of the kind
of secrets you can reveal to us?

07:16.803 --> 07:21.797
Honey, they're just the tip of the iceberg.

07:25.411 --> 07:29.142
This is the Jupiter 2 from Lost in Space.

07:30.817 --> 07:33.911
Yeah, those are BS. But only those.

07:33.986 --> 07:37.786
l was freelancing
for this foreign billionaire.

07:37.857 --> 07:41.588
l told him the air force lost a flying saucer
in the Bermuda Triangle,

07:41.661 --> 07:46.030
and that l could recover it for him.
l just wanted to cruise the Bahamas.

07:46.132 --> 07:51.866
l never would have given him the real thing.
That would be un-American.

07:55.208 --> 07:57.836
- Coming out.
- He found out. He wants to kill me.

07:57.944 --> 08:00.344
l need protection. Super-soldiers.

08:12.859 --> 08:16.295
What do you know about super-soldiers?

08:16.362 --> 08:18.387
A bit.

08:18.498 --> 08:22.798
lt may be there's one
l can help you lay your hands on.

08:26.639 --> 08:29.972
This super-soldier, he have a name?

08:30.910 --> 08:33.504
Not he. She.

08:44.155 --> 08:47.023
What the hell do they want?

08:54.767 --> 08:56.860
Gentlemen.

08:57.904 --> 09:00.429
What happened here?
Did you get robbed?

09:00.540 --> 09:03.771
- No.
- We're upgrading everything.

09:03.876 --> 09:09.508
We gave away all our old crap to the Salvation
Army. We're buying totally new stuff.

09:09.582 --> 09:13.109
- What can we do for you?
- We were hoping you could help us out.

09:13.219 --> 09:18.452
For months now we've been investigating
this secret cadre, the so-called super-soldiers.

09:18.558 --> 09:21.721
- Genetically altered humans.
- That want to kill Mulder.

09:21.794 --> 09:26.424
Exactly. We'd like your help
tracking one down.

09:26.799 --> 09:29.461
This woman.

09:29.569 --> 09:32.094
You recognize her?

09:36.108 --> 09:40.943
She's a fellow hacker. Damn fine one.

09:41.047 --> 09:45.575
She calls herself Yves Adele Harlow.
lt's not her real name.

09:45.651 --> 09:49.109
She disappeared a year ago
and nobody's seen her since.

09:49.221 --> 09:52.247
We have reason to believe
that she's resurfaced,

09:52.325 --> 09:55.453
and that she's become
one of these super-soldiers.

09:55.561 --> 09:58.826
What in hell are you talking about?
She's no super-soldier.

09:58.931 --> 10:01.456
- Absolutely not.
- Who told you that?

10:01.567 --> 10:04.058
This is pointless.

10:06.505 --> 10:09.736
These three monkeys
couldn't find stink in an outhouse.

10:09.809 --> 10:12.300
You son of a...

10:14.747 --> 10:16.578
- Let me at him.
- l'll hold him down.

10:16.649 --> 10:19.015
- Fellas.
- You got a nerve coming here.

10:19.118 --> 10:21.780
Miserable son of a bitch.

10:21.854 --> 10:25.654
- Told you they wouldn't help.
- All right. Everybody just shut up.

10:25.758 --> 10:28.784
This man is a professional liar.
Every word out of his mouth.

10:28.861 --> 10:33.161
- He used us to track Yves down a year ago.
- And then he abducted her.

10:33.265 --> 10:38.293
Which is why l know what happened to her.
l facilitated a meeting is all.

10:38.371 --> 10:43.365
And the man l was working for, l didn't know
in advance what he was planning to do to her.

10:43.476 --> 10:47.640
- Not my finest hour, l'll admit it.
- Every word out of his mouth.

10:47.713 --> 10:51.444
Agents, l'm telling you,
you don't want these three involved.

10:51.517 --> 10:56.477
They don't even have their gismos. This place
is like ''How the Grinch Stole RadioShack.''

10:56.555 --> 11:01.151
All right. You three know this woman.
l want your help.

11:01.227 --> 11:04.822
We need to track down
this Yves Adele Harlow.

11:41.067 --> 11:43.160
Knock, please.

11:55.281 --> 11:59.240
My office hours are 3 to 5,
Mondays and Fridays.

11:59.351 --> 12:02.878
You'll make time for me, Professor.

12:17.970 --> 12:20.461
Douglas, are you ready to go?

12:22.141 --> 12:24.234
Douglas?

13:13.292 --> 13:16.489
Airline reservation database.
What name do we look under?

13:16.595 --> 13:20.531
Try her old standby -
different anagrams of Lee Harvey Oswald.

13:20.633 --> 13:24.330
''Area 51 Exposé?''

13:24.436 --> 13:29.533
- Where's your new issue? This is a year old.
- Back off, skeezicks.

13:29.642 --> 13:32.634
You'll never find her that way.

13:35.681 --> 13:38.673
He's right.
No anagrams for Yves Adele Harlow.

13:40.519 --> 13:42.885
- So who's Joey?
- What?

13:44.690 --> 13:46.282
Joey Ramone.

13:46.358 --> 13:51.557
Leader of the greatest punk rock band
in human history. Now shut up.

13:52.398 --> 13:55.299
What?

13:57.403 --> 14:02.067
What are you? 34? 35?
Why don't you cut your hair and grow up?

14:02.174 --> 14:05.974
Need l remind you that Doggett and Reyes
aren't here to save you.

14:06.045 --> 14:11.415
Yeah, well. Get yourself a real hero, anyway.
Not some dead teenybopper.

14:15.087 --> 14:17.988
You wanna know
why Joey Ramone's my hero?

14:18.057 --> 14:21.720
'Cause people like you
never managed to grind him down.

14:21.827 --> 14:27.424
They never stole his spirit. He never gave in,
never gave up, and never sold out.

14:27.533 --> 14:29.933
Right till his last breath.

14:30.903 --> 14:33.497
And he's not dead.

14:33.572 --> 14:37.064
Guys like that, they live forever.

14:37.176 --> 14:40.009
Langly, just ignore him.

14:47.720 --> 14:50.746
lf we have to work together,
let's work together.

14:50.856 --> 14:52.585
We don't have to work together.

14:52.691 --> 14:58.391
Watching you three trying to find your butts
with both hands is not my idea of a fun time.

14:58.464 --> 15:04.425
Wouldn't it be easier tracking Yves
if you knew her real name?

15:04.536 --> 15:06.800
You know her real name?

15:06.906 --> 15:08.533
Lois Runtz.

15:11.410 --> 15:14.140
Lois Runtz? Uh-huh.

15:14.246 --> 15:17.340
- l'm telling you the truth.
- lf you were, it'd be a first.

15:21.787 --> 15:24.881
Nobody knows about that door.
That's our secret door.

15:24.957 --> 15:27.221
Does Lois know about it?

15:27.626 --> 15:29.617
Yves?

15:47.279 --> 15:49.304
Jimmy?

15:49.815 --> 15:51.908
Guys.

16:04.496 --> 16:06.589
Jimmy?

16:06.665 --> 16:12.001
- How you feeling?
- Oh, right. The old errand boy.

16:12.104 --> 16:16.666
Guy used to intern for you losers, right?
l wondered what happened to you.

16:16.775 --> 16:19.471
Why is he here?

16:19.545 --> 16:23.982
FBl business. lt's a long story.

16:24.049 --> 16:26.847
Where the hell you been, big guy?

16:27.886 --> 16:32.380
Zurich, then Malta, then Yemen.

16:32.491 --> 16:35.358
And just now New Jersey.

16:35.461 --> 16:38.658
lt's been a real geology lesson.

16:39.498 --> 16:42.023
l ran out of money, so l hitchhiked here.

16:42.134 --> 16:48.505
l snuck in the back 'cause l didn't know
if the place was being watched.

16:54.513 --> 16:56.708
l just had to see you guys.

16:57.750 --> 16:59.479
lt's about Lois.

17:03.155 --> 17:05.714
Lois Runtz?

17:05.824 --> 17:09.224
- That's Yves' real name.
- l told you so.

17:10.262 --> 17:11.854
Wait a minute.

17:11.930 --> 17:15.491
You tracked her all over the world? You?

17:18.002 --> 17:21.063
Mr Brainpower here is lucky to be alive.

17:21.173 --> 17:24.006
Why did you send him?
Were you trying to get him killed?

17:24.076 --> 17:26.771
He sent himself.
We tried to talk him out of it.

17:26.878 --> 17:30.838
Yeah. Now l almost wish you had.

17:34.753 --> 17:37.745
Jimmy, what is it?
Are you all right?

17:37.856 --> 17:43.795
Last night, l traced her
to a little college in New Jersey.

17:45.064 --> 17:49.728
lt's the closest l've been
in a year of searching.

17:50.969 --> 17:54.370
l saw her. l actually laid my eyes on her.

17:56.208 --> 17:58.267
l called to her,

17:59.778 --> 18:02.440
but she ran.

18:02.548 --> 18:05.449
Later on, l found out...

18:09.421 --> 18:13.380
Guys, l think she murdered somebody.

19:13.619 --> 19:15.610
One down.

19:30.536 --> 19:35.633
John Gillnitz? l'm Agent Reyes,
and this is Agent Doggett.

19:35.707 --> 19:38.835
ls this the woman you saw last night?

19:40.212 --> 19:45.206
lt was dark. lt could have been her.
Do you have her in custody?

19:45.317 --> 19:47.308
We're working on it.

19:47.386 --> 19:51.652
What can you tell us about your friend?
Any reason why he may have been targeted?

19:51.723 --> 19:57.559
Absolutely none. Douglas was a wonderful
teacher, and an even better researcher.

19:57.663 --> 20:01.190
- What did he research?
- Elasmobranchii.

20:01.266 --> 20:03.598
Sharks, rays and skates.

20:03.702 --> 20:07.229
- He was a marine biologist?
- An immunologist.

20:07.339 --> 20:09.705
Sharks have a remarkable immune system.

20:09.775 --> 20:13.506
Toxins that would kill any other vertebrate
pass right through them.

20:13.579 --> 20:16.514
So he did medical research?

20:19.851 --> 20:22.911
Douglas wanted to save the world.

20:29.428 --> 20:32.363
Cheer up, gomer.
You're bringing the whole room down.

20:32.431 --> 20:39.769
This is a computer, Langly. Com-pu-ter.
Step away before you embarrass yourself.

20:39.871 --> 20:42.396
- Always a pleasure, Kimmy.
- Yeah, yeah.

20:42.474 --> 20:47.138
So, then, how do you wish
to partake of my hacking genius?

20:47.246 --> 20:52.548
- Thanks to Jimmy, we know Yves' real name.
- l told you before he did.

20:52.618 --> 20:55.485
Jimmy also told us
what kind of car she's driving.

20:55.587 --> 20:57.646
A silver X5 with New York plates.

20:57.756 --> 21:00.452
Really? Way to go, special ed.

21:01.293 --> 21:04.456
The New Jersey Turnpike
has cameras at every tollbooth.

21:04.563 --> 21:08.624
- Langly spotted her southbound at Newark.
- Somewhat creative.

21:08.734 --> 21:13.228
We spotted her again going through
the Fort McHenry Tunnel not 20 minutes ago.

21:13.305 --> 21:17.639
We're betting she's headed for DC.
We'll try to intercept her, with your help.

21:17.743 --> 21:22.806
Think you might find a military satellite to
give us a bird's-eye view of the Beltway?

21:22.914 --> 21:24.973
lntriguing.

21:25.083 --> 21:27.415
Stand aside, ladies.

21:27.486 --> 21:30.478
- We'll be on the cell.
- l got shotgun.

21:30.589 --> 21:33.683
Dream on. You're staying here.

21:35.460 --> 21:39.863
We need somebody we can trust
keeping an eye on Fletcher.

21:39.965 --> 21:42.263
l'm on it.

21:49.541 --> 21:51.668
So how'd you like Malta?

21:51.943 --> 21:55.106
The only thing l can say for sure
is what killed him.

21:55.180 --> 21:58.809
He was injected with
some sort of tiny poison pellet.

21:58.884 --> 22:03.787
But the wound in his chest was postmortem.

22:04.189 --> 22:06.987
- What is that?
- That's what l said.

22:07.059 --> 22:11.792
My best guess is bioluminescence, but
l'm still waiting to hear back from our lab.

22:11.863 --> 22:15.230
Bioluminescence?
The stuff that makes lightning bugs glow?

22:15.334 --> 22:20.863
Lightning bugs, plankton, jellyfish.
But generally not dead college professors.

22:21.373 --> 22:24.501
- So this stuff was put on postmortem?
- No.

22:24.576 --> 22:28.239
As near as l can tell,
it bled out of him.

22:29.514 --> 22:35.043
lt gets weirder still. When l opened him up,
l found adhesions that indicate past surgery.

22:35.153 --> 22:38.680
So l'm figuring l'll find
he had a bypass or a pacemaker.

22:38.757 --> 22:43.490
lnstead, l find... this.

22:47.399 --> 22:49.890
- lt looks like cartilage.
- lt is.

22:50.001 --> 22:56.497
lt was living tissue grafted into him.
l have absolutely no idea why.

23:04.916 --> 23:09.853
lt held something.
Something that's now missing.

23:11.556 --> 23:15.583
Could that be the purpose of this wound?
A little ad hoc surgery?

23:15.694 --> 23:18.595
Maybe that was
the very purpose of the murder.

23:18.697 --> 23:22.599
Whatever was inside him, she removed it.

23:22.701 --> 23:25.431
What the hell was inside him?

23:25.537 --> 23:30.133
l have no clue. Seriously,
this is the first l'm hearing of it.

23:30.242 --> 23:31.800
Weird organs?

23:31.877 --> 23:36.075
You've never heard of the man?
Professor Douglas Houghton.

23:37.482 --> 23:39.450
You're looking at me oddly.

23:39.518 --> 23:43.852
Perhaps because you've been
known to lie on occasion.

23:43.922 --> 23:49.656
l'm not lying now. l've said from the start
l didn't know what she was up to.

23:49.728 --> 23:52.891
Damn it. Crashed again.

23:53.665 --> 23:56.759
l cannot make magic
with substandard equipment.

23:56.835 --> 23:59.133
- What's the problem?
- The problem is,

23:59.237 --> 24:02.001
it's a freaking piece ofjunk.

24:02.107 --> 24:06.476
l knew those guys were broke,
but this is pathetic.

24:10.115 --> 24:12.948
The guys are broke?

24:13.018 --> 24:15.578
Are you kidding? Look around this dump.

24:15.654 --> 24:18.748
They had to hock all their stuff
just to pay the rent.

24:18.824 --> 24:21.292
- What about this?
- Their paper?

24:21.359 --> 24:25.489
Deader than disco.
They haven't published in months.

24:27.666 --> 24:33.002
So saving the world doesn't pay the bills.
There's a hot news flash for you.

24:33.104 --> 24:35.163
What chumps.

24:35.273 --> 24:38.140
They were getting by
till you put 'em out of business.

24:38.210 --> 24:40.770
And how exactly did l do that?

24:41.279 --> 24:46.546
When you took Yves.
They spent every last dime trying to find her.

24:46.651 --> 24:50.610
They're loyal to their friends.
Hilarious, huh?

24:57.329 --> 24:59.797
- Reyes.
- You better get here quick.

24:59.865 --> 25:03.699
- Where are you?
- The Hotel Farragut. Hurry.

25:42.941 --> 25:45.375
- She'll kill him.
- Doggett and Reyes are coming.

25:45.443 --> 25:48.571
By then it'll be too late.

26:09.734 --> 26:11.702
Yves. Don't do it.

26:33.491 --> 26:35.584
Lois?

26:38.830 --> 26:41.390
Should l call you that?

26:41.466 --> 26:43.457
l prefer Yves.

26:43.568 --> 26:46.833
So we take it you're not a super-soldier?

26:47.472 --> 26:50.134
Super what?

26:50.241 --> 26:52.732
Long story. Never mind.

26:54.512 --> 26:58.278
Yves, you weren't seriously
going to smoke that guy, were you?

26:58.350 --> 27:01.649
l know you three mean well,

27:01.753 --> 27:05.689
but l can't begin to tell you
how badly you've mucked things up.

27:08.760 --> 27:12.491
- So this guy just up and bolted?
- He hit her, and then he took off.

27:12.597 --> 27:17.330
Nobody's seen him. The room is registered
to Leonard Southhall of Darien, Connecticut.

27:17.435 --> 27:20.962
- lt's an alias.
- lt's a stolen lD.

27:21.039 --> 27:25.840
The real Leonard Southhall died in 1996.
You wanna tell me who that was?

27:25.944 --> 27:28.845
His real name? l have no idea.

27:34.185 --> 27:37.120
This is your bag, isn't it?

27:39.124 --> 27:42.059
lt's quite a party you got planned for him.

27:42.160 --> 27:44.492
Respirator.

27:44.562 --> 27:47.531
Surgical gloves.

27:47.632 --> 27:49.293
Scalpel.

27:54.072 --> 27:56.404
Not to mention this little item here.

27:56.508 --> 28:00.842
You were planning to cut him open,
like you did the professor. Why?

28:00.912 --> 28:04.473
Yves, it can't be true.
Tell them it's not.

28:04.549 --> 28:07.746
lt is, Jimmy. Time is running short.

28:07.852 --> 28:11.754
Unless you let me finish what l started,
innocent people will die.

28:11.856 --> 28:15.417
- You wanna elaborate on that?
- First things first.

28:15.527 --> 28:17.518
Who was it that put you on to me?

28:18.563 --> 28:23.762
OK, guys. So she's not a super-soldier.
l made an honest mistake.

28:28.039 --> 28:31.440
As l suspected.
lt's a tracking device.

28:31.543 --> 28:36.207
l'm sure he meant to activate it
once he knew you had me.

28:39.117 --> 28:43.110
You've been wearing that since Miami. You
were running a scam on us from the start.

28:43.221 --> 28:47.590
Blowing up the boat, the girl
as your witness - you planned all that.

28:47.692 --> 28:51.184
That and all the super-soldier bull.
All that was just to hook us.

28:51.262 --> 28:54.595
So that you two would, in turn, hook us.

28:54.699 --> 28:59.398
And we'd track down Yves
for this slime ball all over again.

28:59.471 --> 29:03.407
What can l tell ya?
You three always get the job done for me.

29:03.475 --> 29:06.410
Who do you work for, Fletcher?

29:06.478 --> 29:11.609
An international arms dealer,
a billionaire, and scum of the earth.

29:11.716 --> 29:14.879
And he's also...

29:15.620 --> 29:17.918
My father.

29:20.592 --> 29:26.121
My father is a murderer and a supporter
of terrorism. l hate everything he stands for.

29:26.231 --> 29:27.755
Yves,

29:27.832 --> 29:30.630
you're a murderer too.

29:30.735 --> 29:33.135
The man l killed was a terrorist, Jimmy.

29:33.238 --> 29:39.177
A zealot whose research was funded by my
father for its potential as a weapons system.

29:39.277 --> 29:42.110
Houghton was an immunologist,
researching sharks.

29:42.180 --> 29:47.447
Yes. And he used his knowledge of their
immune system to devise a vessel of sorts

29:47.519 --> 29:51.011
that kept him safe from
an engineered virus he carried within him.

29:51.122 --> 29:53.317
He had tissue implanted in his chest.

29:53.424 --> 29:58.487
Cartilage. Shark cartilage.
lt contained something which you removed.

29:58.596 --> 30:03.158
- This virus you were talking about.
- l destroyed it, but it was only one of two.

30:03.268 --> 30:06.465
The bald dude at the hotel,
the one that got away.

30:06.538 --> 30:08.972
Think of him as a human time bomb.

30:09.040 --> 30:13.340
He can pass by any sniff dog, any metal
detector, and no one would ever suspect.

30:13.444 --> 30:16.777
- What triggers this time bomb?
- Programmed cellular death,

30:16.848 --> 30:19.715
genetically altered
to a high degree of precision.

30:19.818 --> 30:23.015
The way the vessel is decaying
inside him is clock-like.

30:23.121 --> 30:27.353
lt will lose integrity and rupture
at eight o'clock tonight.

30:27.458 --> 30:29.824
- Five hours from now?
- This virus,

30:29.894 --> 30:33.455
once it's airborne
its kill radius is five or six miles.

30:33.531 --> 30:38.867
Potentially it could kill thousands.
Tens of thousands.

30:38.970 --> 30:44.340
Fletcher, l know you're a dirt bag,
but still, how could you be a party to this?

30:44.409 --> 30:48.903
Fletcher's a con man, not a killer.
He didn't know about it.

30:51.482 --> 30:55.714
Providing all this is true,
how do we track this man down?

31:00.692 --> 31:04.355
- Kimmy, zoom in more. Zoom in.
- Back off, kibitzer. l'm doing it.

31:04.429 --> 31:07.262
This is slower than Stumpy,
my one-legged granny.

31:07.365 --> 31:12.393
- Where did you get this dinosaur turd?
- Stop bellyaching and work.

31:12.503 --> 31:15.336
- Those things'll kill you.
- Yeah.

31:15.406 --> 31:19.342
That's why l quit 20 years ago. You want one?

31:23.281 --> 31:25.875
So you're too broke to publish?

31:25.950 --> 31:28.180
Pencil neck told me.

31:29.220 --> 31:33.452
lt's a shame. This little rag
always was such a hoot.

31:33.558 --> 31:35.617
l'm gonna miss it.

31:35.727 --> 31:39.527
But, hey, the world spins on, right?

31:39.597 --> 31:42.896
Maybe saving it is a younger man's game.

31:42.967 --> 31:45.367
Or a woman's.

31:51.643 --> 31:54.407
Maybe it is.

31:54.479 --> 31:58.973
You gotta admit, Byers,
it hasn't exactly been our year.

31:59.083 --> 32:03.486
And to top it all off,
we screwed the pooch pretty good today.

32:03.588 --> 32:08.582
- Maybe we should pack it in.
- And do what instead?

32:08.660 --> 32:11.424
We never gave up. We never will.

32:11.496 --> 32:16.593
ln the end, if that's the best
they can say about us, it'll do.

32:17.568 --> 32:20.901
- l got him.
- lt's my hack, Langly. l got him.

32:20.972 --> 32:22.803
We got him, all right?

32:22.907 --> 32:26.900
Our bad guy just rented a blue Corolla
under his alias Leonard Southhall.

32:26.978 --> 32:30.573
- We picked him up on the satellite.
- Hauling north like a bat out of hell.

32:30.648 --> 32:34.015
New Jersey Turnpike,
30 miles south of Newark.

32:34.118 --> 32:36.245
l think l know where he's headed.

33:04.382 --> 33:08.842
- Long Gunman Newspaper Group, Byers.
- Byers, John Doggett.

33:08.953 --> 33:11.683
Agent Doggett. Do you have him?

33:12.323 --> 33:14.814
Yeah. We got him.

33:15.960 --> 33:20.988
How much do you trust this Yves Harlow,
Lois Runtz, whatever name she's telling you?

33:21.065 --> 33:23.056
Completely. Why?

33:23.167 --> 33:27.570
Because the doctors here have run every
kind of imaging and come up snake eyes.

33:27.672 --> 33:31.130
No virus, no cartilage vessel
in his chest, nothing.

33:31.209 --> 33:34.542
- They found nothing.
- That doesn't make sense.

33:35.346 --> 33:38.645
- They're absolutely certain?
- 100 percent.

33:38.716 --> 33:42.675
Agent Reyes and l are looking
like a couple of fools on this one.

33:42.754 --> 33:44.881
There must be something we missed.

33:44.989 --> 33:48.152
All l can tell you is, we got the wrong guy.

33:53.197 --> 33:57.896
There must be a second man.
l know there is. lt's Basic Terrorism 101.

33:58.002 --> 34:00.903
Except we don't know his name or his target.

34:01.005 --> 34:03.906
And we've got one hour to find him.

34:33.538 --> 34:35.096
Good evening.

34:36.139 --> 34:38.233
You're good.

34:41.978 --> 34:44.607
All my information pointed to that man.

34:44.715 --> 34:48.310
He goes by an alias.
He traveled to Washington on this very day.

34:48.418 --> 34:51.547
- Clearly he's involved somehow.
- He must be.

34:51.621 --> 34:55.388
He made a beeline to that biology department
where the professor worked.

34:55.460 --> 34:58.224
- Their base of operation.
- Yeah.

34:58.296 --> 35:01.663
So if he is involved
and yet he doesn't have the virus...?

35:01.766 --> 35:06.601
- So how exactly does he fit into their plan?
- Three card monty.

35:07.305 --> 35:11.071
- You ever played it? You have now.
- What's that supposed to mean?

35:11.142 --> 35:15.636
lt means these guys have you running after
the ace when you should chase the queen.

35:15.746 --> 35:17.737
Oh, my God.

35:17.815 --> 35:21.273
Southhall is the decoy. That's all he is.

35:21.352 --> 35:24.947
They knew you were on their trail
so they gave you someone else to follow.

35:25.022 --> 35:28.924
- You said you didn't know about terrorists.
- l don't.

35:28.993 --> 35:33.589
But l know scams. l wasn't
a man in black all those years for nothing.

35:33.664 --> 35:36.462
They made you work at finding Southhall,

35:36.534 --> 35:39.970
which tells me the real guy
is hiding right out in the open.

35:40.037 --> 35:43.803
A friend of the dead professor.
A coworker, maybe.

35:43.875 --> 35:48.539
The man who saw me through the professor's
window. The one who identified me.

35:49.180 --> 35:54.208
Ladies and gentlemen, scientists, academic
leaders and government representatives.

35:54.318 --> 35:59.221
Coming together is our goal this evening,
coming together as one.

35:59.323 --> 36:01.291
Those words are easily spoken,

36:01.359 --> 36:06.296
but guiding our missile into that fugitive
and imponderable target is harder.

36:12.170 --> 36:15.537
- Sorry. Conference attendees only.
- We're reporters.

36:15.640 --> 36:19.076
- What newspaper do you work for?
- The Lone Gunman.

36:21.579 --> 36:24.013
- Never heard of it.
- We're legit.

36:24.081 --> 36:27.346
- Show him your press pass.
- lt's important we get in there.

36:27.418 --> 36:30.751
- Buddy, come on.
- These expired last December.

36:30.855 --> 36:32.550
- We've got five minutes.
- Listen.

36:32.657 --> 36:35.490
We believe there's a dangerous man
in that room.

36:35.560 --> 36:37.619
l need all of you to step away right now.

36:37.695 --> 36:40.664
Look, thousands of people may die.

36:40.731 --> 36:43.165
l got a situation
by the main conference room.

36:43.234 --> 36:45.361
John Gillnitz.

36:45.536 --> 36:47.663
John Gillnitz.

36:48.806 --> 36:50.364
Step back, sir.

36:55.179 --> 36:57.875
l'm really sorry.

37:06.257 --> 37:09.954
- Where'd he go?
- Split up. Four minutes left. Good luck.

37:10.061 --> 37:13.258
Wait. What do we do with this guy
once we find him?

37:13.364 --> 37:17.061
- Hold him till l get there. l'll do the rest.
- You mean cut him open?

37:17.134 --> 37:21.195
lf that virus gets into the airstream,
we'll have failed. People will die.

37:21.272 --> 37:23.263
Whatever it takes.

37:38.589 --> 37:41.080
Three minutes and counting.

38:01.245 --> 38:04.737
- Don't try to run.
- l don't have to.

38:04.815 --> 38:08.012
- Yves. Jimmy. We've found him.
- Over here.

38:08.119 --> 38:11.782
What do you plan to do?
By my watch, it's two minutes to eight.

38:11.856 --> 38:15.485
- Not much time for surgery.
- Yves. Jimmy.

38:17.328 --> 38:19.819
Now you have a minute 40.

38:25.970 --> 38:28.029
Guys?

38:34.011 --> 38:36.309
Whatever it takes.

38:57.668 --> 39:00.569
Byers. Frohike. Langly.

39:03.908 --> 39:05.705
Yves. Come here.

39:05.810 --> 39:07.539
Guys.

39:08.713 --> 39:10.044
Guys.

39:25.062 --> 39:27.155
Oh, God. No.

39:33.003 --> 39:34.061
Don't. Jimmy.

39:34.171 --> 39:36.230
Jimmy, don't.

39:38.175 --> 39:40.507
lt's airtight.

39:40.578 --> 39:43.775
They're already exposed.

39:50.688 --> 39:53.418
No, guys.

40:04.235 --> 40:06.726
Buddy, fight the good fight.

40:09.540 --> 40:11.599
Both of you.

40:14.145 --> 40:16.238
Never give up.

41:14.505 --> 41:20.967
Arlington. You must have pulled
some big strings to get those guys in here.

41:22.379 --> 41:24.779
lt's the least l could do.

41:32.690 --> 41:34.783
Are we ready?

41:35.526 --> 41:37.619
Yeah.

41:41.499 --> 41:43.729
Dana?

41:43.834 --> 41:45.893
l'll catch up.

41:57.648 --> 42:00.549
They meant so much to me.

42:03.187 --> 42:06.884
l'm not sure if they ever really knew.

42:08.592 --> 42:12.926
Nobody knew what heroes they were.

42:19.603 --> 42:21.696
lt's not right.

42:23.707 --> 42:25.572
lt's not.

42:25.676 --> 42:28.167
No, it's not.

42:33.551 --> 42:38.545
Langly said to me ''the ones who
never give up, they never die.''

42:41.859 --> 42:44.851
l still don't know what that means.

42:47.598 --> 42:53.867
lt means, like everyone buried here, the world
is a better place for them having been in it.

42:56.206 --> 43:02.702
lt means that they're gone,
but they live on through us all.
