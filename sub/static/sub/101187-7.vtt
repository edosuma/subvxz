WEBVTT

00:06.215 --> 00:08.008
Goddamn it!

00:09.718 --> 00:12.346
Motherfucking squirrels! Shit!

00:12.429 --> 00:14.932
Get your ass out of here! Shoo!

00:15.015 --> 00:16.600
Go, squirrel!

00:18.560 --> 00:19.895
Motherfucker.

00:19.978 --> 00:22.940
You better get your ass back!
You hear me?

00:23.023 --> 00:25.025
I ain't scared of you.

00:25.108 --> 00:27.945
You better keep it over there,
'fore you get hurt.

00:28.028 --> 00:31.448
You bring it over here,
you'll get what you want. Shit. Oh.

00:31.532 --> 00:34.117
I see you. I ain't take my eye off you.

00:34.201 --> 00:36.537
I got you locked in.

00:36.620 --> 00:38.622
Stay back!

00:41.416 --> 00:42.960
Stupid woods!

01:01.353 --> 01:04.481
Oh. Thank God.

01:04.565 --> 01:07.526
Excuse me. Excuse me, sir.

01:07.609 --> 01:09.528
How you doing, man?

01:12.406 --> 01:14.283
- Do you know you're trespassing?

01:14.366 --> 01:17.160
- Yes. I mean, no. No, I didn't.

01:17.244 --> 01:18.745
I do now, but I...

01:18.829 --> 01:21.331
- Sign posted right over there.

01:21.415 --> 01:24.084
Only got two words on it--

01:24.168 --> 01:28.714
"no" and "trespassing."

01:28.797 --> 01:31.592
- Yep. I see it now.

01:31.675 --> 01:34.970
I see it now. I didn't see that
when I... when I came in,

01:35.053 --> 01:37.389
'cause the way I came in,
my back was to that,

01:37.472 --> 01:39.099
so I never caught that. I was...

01:39.183 --> 01:42.144
- You're a... a city boy, ain't you?

01:42.227 --> 01:45.439
- I kind of refer to myself
as a "city man."

01:45.522 --> 01:46.857
Not a... boy.

01:46.940 --> 01:48.233
You could say "boy-man."

01:48.317 --> 01:49.651
Whatever you... What do you prefer?

01:49.735 --> 01:51.987
- Woods ain't safe for a city boy.

01:54.781 --> 01:56.867
Much less a city man.

02:00.245 --> 02:01.705
- Okay.

02:01.788 --> 02:04.041
I'm going to address
the elephant in the woods.

02:04.124 --> 02:06.293
This whole Deliverance thing
that we got going on right now,

02:06.376 --> 02:08.295
which is great, okay,
because it's working.

02:08.378 --> 02:11.006
So, when things are working, you give 'em
the accolades that they deserve.

02:11.089 --> 02:12.966
I'm... I'm uncomfortable, sir.

02:13.050 --> 02:14.635
I'm actually scared, right?

02:14.718 --> 02:16.929
So, now that we know that,
let me help this mood

02:17.012 --> 02:18.555
by just telling you why I'm here.

02:18.639 --> 02:20.682
I'm trying to use a phone.
You got a phone?

02:20.766 --> 02:24.269
I want to use it real quick,
and I'm out of here.

02:27.523 --> 02:29.399
- Two minutes.

02:29.483 --> 02:30.901
- No, I'm not out of my mind.

02:30.984 --> 02:32.819
As a matter of fact,
I'm very much in my mind.

02:32.903 --> 02:34.196
The dude's trying to kill me.

02:34.279 --> 02:35.656
- That's unfortunate.

02:35.739 --> 02:37.199
- What do you mean?
Unfortunate?

02:37.282 --> 02:38.617
Listen to me, Danny.

02:38.700 --> 02:40.118
He's trying to kill me!

02:40.202 --> 02:42.329
- No, totally. Kev, listen.

02:42.412 --> 02:44.373
I got huge news. Right? Ready?

02:44.456 --> 02:46.208
Pound Pups Four.

02:46.291 --> 02:49.545
Pound... Pups... Four.

02:49.628 --> 02:51.421
They want you to voice Reggie,

02:51.505 --> 02:53.757
a quick-witted,
short-tempered goldendoodle

02:53.841 --> 02:55.676
who craves mischief.

02:55.759 --> 02:57.469
- Did they ask for me directly?
- Yeah!

02:57.553 --> 03:00.222
Now, listen, the-the money's not
what you're used to making,

03:00.305 --> 03:03.433
but this could be the role
that gets you back into good graces

03:03.517 --> 03:04.935
with the comedy gods.

03:06.562 --> 03:08.397
- Hey, I...

03:10.065 --> 03:11.650
Hey. I...

03:11.733 --> 03:13.068
Hi.

03:13.151 --> 03:15.404
Hey, I'm Reggie, the goldendoodle,

03:15.487 --> 03:17.447
and I'm ready to crave some mischief.

03:17.531 --> 03:19.324
- Genius! You're a genius!

03:19.408 --> 03:21.535
It's amazing!
I'm in the movie right now.

03:21.618 --> 03:23.871
I'm watching the movie.

03:23.954 --> 03:27.165
Now, normally, we'd, you know, counter,

03:27.249 --> 03:29.710
negotiate a better deal, blah, blah, blah.

03:29.793 --> 03:32.171
I think we should close this one.
Huh? What do you think?

03:32.254 --> 03:34.047
No. No, no, don't sigh.

03:34.131 --> 03:35.090
Be happy.

03:35.174 --> 03:37.384
This is good, Kev.

03:42.097 --> 03:43.932
Ah, goddamn it.

03:44.016 --> 03:45.642
Are you crying?

03:45.726 --> 03:47.769
- How did we get here, Danny?

03:47.853 --> 03:49.521
Hmm?

03:49.605 --> 03:51.023
How did we get here?

03:51.106 --> 03:52.649
Just tell me how we got here.

03:52.733 --> 03:54.818
- Look, stop beating yourself up.

03:54.902 --> 03:57.029
Huh? You made a mistake.

03:57.112 --> 03:58.697
You tried to be something you're not.

03:58.780 --> 04:01.116
You're not an action hero.
You know that now.

04:01.200 --> 04:03.452
So, is that a yes on Pound Pups Four?

04:03.535 --> 04:04.620
- Oh...

04:04.703 --> 04:06.205
- Help!

04:06.288 --> 04:08.123
Help me! I'm stuck!

04:08.207 --> 04:09.499
- Kev?

04:09.583 --> 04:11.293
Kevin, I need a verbal "yes" on this.

04:11.376 --> 04:13.170
Kevin, don't let this

04:13.253 --> 04:14.505
go away, buddy.

04:14.588 --> 04:16.965
- Help me!
- Kevin, goldendoodles.

04:17.049 --> 04:18.383
You love dogs, Kevin!

04:18.467 --> 04:20.969
- Help!
- Kevin?

04:21.053 --> 04:22.387
- Help me!
- Oh, shit.

04:22.471 --> 04:23.805
- Help!
- Hey.

04:23.889 --> 04:25.390
Hey, you okay?
- No, my...

04:25.474 --> 04:27.643
- Oh, fuck.
- ...damn jack broke!

04:27.726 --> 04:29.978
- Shit!

04:30.062 --> 04:31.980
- It's on my chest.

04:32.064 --> 04:33.607
- Hey.
- I can't breathe.

04:33.690 --> 04:35.943
- I'm gonna go call somebody
right now, man. Okay?

04:36.026 --> 04:37.736
I'm gonna go call some...

04:37.819 --> 04:40.781
Hey! Hey!

04:40.864 --> 04:44.159
Oh, shit.

04:44.243 --> 04:45.827
Okay.

04:45.911 --> 04:48.622
Come on. You got to lift this truck.

04:48.705 --> 04:50.999
You got to lift this truck!

04:51.083 --> 04:52.960
Lift the fucking truck!

04:53.043 --> 04:54.503
Come on, Kevin!

04:54.586 --> 04:56.171
All right. Ready.

04:56.255 --> 04:58.715
Three, two, one.

05:01.426 --> 05:05.472
I'm doing it! I'm doing it!

05:12.312 --> 05:13.647
Oh.

05:13.730 --> 05:15.107
You okay?

05:15.190 --> 05:17.818
Breathe, man.

05:17.901 --> 05:19.236
Slow down.
- Ooh.

05:19.319 --> 05:21.572
- Take your time, all right?

05:21.655 --> 05:23.073
Nice and slow. Get your breath back.

05:23.156 --> 05:25.409
- Oh, my God. You just saved my life.

05:25.492 --> 05:27.911
- No. No, man.
- Oh... oh, oh, yeah.

05:27.995 --> 05:29.997
You're like a real-life Rambo.

05:34.835 --> 05:36.461
- I guess I kind of am.

05:40.757 --> 05:42.759
- How can I ever repay you, sir?

05:42.843 --> 05:45.387
- Sir? No, man.

05:45.470 --> 05:47.139
Wait. You don't know who I am?

05:47.222 --> 05:50.517
You don't recognize me from movies,
TV, stand-up comedy?

05:50.601 --> 05:52.477
- Uh... no.

05:56.648 --> 05:59.484
- The name is Hart.

05:59.568 --> 06:01.695
Agent... Hart.

06:05.657 --> 06:07.618
Now, you wouldn't happen to know
of a shortcut

06:07.701 --> 06:09.912
back to Ron Wilcox's Action School,
would you?

06:09.995 --> 06:11.205
- Wilcox property?
- Yeah.

06:11.288 --> 06:13.373
- Uh, yes, Agent. Uh...

06:13.457 --> 06:16.251
You can follow that path,
and it'll take you right to it.

06:16.335 --> 06:17.836
- Okay. I think I'm gonna go

06:17.920 --> 06:20.047
and get on that trail
before the sun goes down.

06:20.130 --> 06:22.049
- Fuck that.

06:22.132 --> 06:25.260
You ain't walking.

06:30.807 --> 06:32.601
- Oh, yeah.

06:42.653 --> 06:44.071
- How was that?

06:44.154 --> 06:45.864
- Phenomenal. We got it.

06:45.948 --> 06:48.075
- All right,
that's a wrap on creepy trailer!

06:49.409 --> 06:50.911
- Well done, everyone.
- Good job, everybody.

07:07.970 --> 07:09.471
- Stop!

07:09.555 --> 07:10.931
Goddamn it! Stop!

07:11.014 --> 07:13.100
- You motherfuckers.

07:15.936 --> 07:18.397
Chitty Chitty Bang Bang, bitch.

07:20.649 --> 07:22.943
No! No!

07:23.735 --> 07:24.862
Fuck!

07:26.446 --> 07:28.407
- Oh.

07:28.490 --> 07:31.451
Holy shit, Jordan. You weren't joking.

07:31.535 --> 07:33.745
He actually thinks we're using
real bullets today. Kev!

07:33.829 --> 07:35.914
- You told 'em?

07:35.998 --> 07:38.292
- I'm sorry. It was funny.
- It's not fucking funny!

07:38.375 --> 07:40.836
'Cause that man back there is a lunatic.

07:40.919 --> 07:42.963
You're a fucking lunatic, Coach Ron.

07:43.046 --> 07:44.464
- Hey, you know what?

07:45.507 --> 07:47.259
Maybe I am a lunatic.

07:47.342 --> 07:48.760
Maybe I ought to just kill you!

07:49.845 --> 07:51.930
- Hey. No, Ron, hold up.

07:52.014 --> 07:53.932
Let me kill him.
- Stop it.

07:54.016 --> 07:56.185
- No, me, me, me!

07:56.268 --> 07:57.978
- Stop it. Stop!

07:58.061 --> 07:59.605
Know what, assholes?

07:59.688 --> 08:00.772
Y'all want to fucking play the player.

08:00.856 --> 08:02.024
Go ahead! Unload 'em all.

08:02.107 --> 08:04.318
- All right.
- Now we're having fun.

08:05.569 --> 08:07.112
- After you.

08:07.196 --> 08:08.572
Oh!

08:08.655 --> 08:10.157
- Yeah.
- Ah.

08:11.617 --> 08:13.327
- Shit!

08:13.410 --> 08:15.495
- Holy shit.

08:15.579 --> 08:17.873
Maybe there was a bullet in there.

08:17.956 --> 08:19.666
- You're a bad man.

08:19.750 --> 08:21.543
- Motherfucker, man!
