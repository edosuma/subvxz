00:52.120 --> 00:56.100
At the age of 26,
Ludwig van Beethoven went deaf,

00:56.200 --> 01:00.460
ending his career as a
successful concert pianist.

01:00.560 --> 01:03.100
But determined not to let a
little thing like his hearing

01:03.200 --> 01:04.739
end his music career,

01:04.840 --> 01:07.500
my pal Ludwig became a composer.

01:07.600 --> 01:10.340
Turned out the new gig suited him.

01:10.440 --> 01:12.140
It's like that old saying,

01:12.240 --> 01:16.020
"Life is what happens when
you're busy making other plans."

01:16.120 --> 01:17.500
Take my dad.

01:17.600 --> 01:19.220
When my little brother,
Teddy, was born,

01:19.320 --> 01:20.860
he quit his band to get a real job.

01:20.960 --> 01:23.900
But then he fell in
love with teaching.

01:24.000 --> 01:25.980
Now he spends his
days in the mosh pit

01:26.080 --> 01:28.500
that is high school English class.

01:28.600 --> 01:31.380
Or my mom, a riot girl
who found her calling

01:31.480 --> 01:35.900
as a part-time travel agent
and a full-time supermom.

01:36.000 --> 01:37.740
These days, she only
moshes with Teddy.

01:37.840 --> 01:39.944
Scooch over, dude.

01:41.320 --> 01:43.260
And then there's me.

01:43.360 --> 01:45.220
I thought I knew where I was going.

01:45.320 --> 01:48.380
I thought I had it all mapped out.

01:48.480 --> 01:51.180
Turns out, I had no idea.

01:51.280 --> 01:53.620
Your coffee, maestro.

01:53.720 --> 01:55.060
- Thank you.
- Me too. I want some!

01:55.160 --> 01:56.260
No way, dude.

01:56.360 --> 01:58.620
You don't give crack to somebody
who's already on speed.

01:58.720 --> 02:00.380
Don't worry,
we switched him to decaf.

02:00.480 --> 02:02.820
- Whoa. As long as you don't switch me.
- No, baby,

02:02.920 --> 02:04.626
that would be child abuse.

02:04.960 --> 02:07.110
Hey, did you see this?

02:10.400 --> 02:12.620
I got a Google Alert
about it yesterday.

02:12.720 --> 02:14.460
It's the most we've seen
of him in a few months.

02:14.560 --> 02:16.505
I know.

02:18.440 --> 02:20.620
Oh, my God, is he really
opening up for The Shins?

02:20.720 --> 02:23.180
Yeah. When they play
in Portland tonight.

02:23.280 --> 02:24.300
That's huge.

02:24.400 --> 02:26.868
Yeah, I know. It's kind of crazy.

02:27.320 --> 02:29.140
Everything he's ever wanted's
actually coming true.

02:29.240 --> 02:30.500
I know you guys haven't
been talking much lately.

02:30.600 --> 02:31.900
Mom, I really don't want
to talk about it, okay?

02:32.000 --> 02:35.820
I'm just saying that if you miss
each other it's okay to reach out.

02:35.920 --> 02:36.940
Okay!

02:37.040 --> 02:38.820
Come on. If you guys
want a ride, we got to go.

02:38.920 --> 02:41.580
Now let's update you on the
snowstorm and school closures.

02:41.680 --> 02:42.740
Baby, turn that up.

02:42.840 --> 02:43.820
Portland and Clackamas counties

02:43.920 --> 02:45.020
are now calling for a snow day.

02:45.120 --> 02:48.540
All schools in Portland and Clackamas
districts will be closed for the day.

02:48.640 --> 02:50.140
Yes! That means no school, kids.

02:50.240 --> 02:51.500
Well, ain't that a bitch?

02:51.600 --> 02:54.102
School's out forever!

02:56.040 --> 02:58.820
Did you really just
quote Alice Cooper?

02:58.920 --> 03:00.700
My God, son, have I
taught you nothing?

03:00.800 --> 03:02.260
Let's go make a snow monster.

03:02.360 --> 03:05.020
We can try. It looks like it's not
really sticking out there, though.

03:05.120 --> 03:06.940
You guys are all playing
hooky without me?

03:07.040 --> 03:08.500
It's not hooky if it's a snow day.

03:08.600 --> 03:09.780
So not fair.

03:09.880 --> 03:11.860
- Life isn't fair.
- That is true.

03:11.960 --> 03:14.340
But sometimes you got to,
like, noodge it a little.

03:15.960 --> 03:17.820
It'd be bad to go to
work with this cough,

03:17.920 --> 03:20.627
spreading my germs around.

03:25.080 --> 03:26.580
You know how when you meet someone

03:26.680 --> 03:29.820
and they just already are the
person they're meant to be?

03:29.920 --> 03:31.060
That was Adam.

03:31.160 --> 03:33.700
Nobody outside Portland
had ever heard of his band.

03:33.800 --> 03:36.540
But he already was somebody.

03:36.640 --> 03:39.791
Everybody knew who he was.

03:41.760 --> 03:43.220
Me?

03:43.320 --> 03:45.185
Not so much.

04:02.440 --> 04:04.260
What class was this?

04:04.360 --> 04:06.060
Advanced Composition.

04:06.160 --> 04:07.380
What's she doing?

04:07.480 --> 04:09.900
She's more advanced.

04:10.000 --> 04:12.300
Adam. What's up?

04:17.800 --> 04:20.620
I think everyone left.

04:21.399 --> 04:24.340
Let's get some lunch.
I am Starvin' Marvin.

04:24.440 --> 04:25.660
Oh, and, by the way,

04:25.760 --> 04:28.140
that Adam rocker dude was
totally checking you out.

04:28.240 --> 04:29.940
Adam Wilde saw me geeking out?

04:30.040 --> 04:32.100
He saw you blissing out
and he was into it.

04:32.200 --> 04:35.380
No, he isn't "into it," Kim.

04:35.480 --> 04:37.020
Yeah, he is, Mia.

04:37.120 --> 04:38.420
He's way into you.

04:38.520 --> 04:40.180
Do not take his picture, Kim.

04:40.280 --> 04:42.623
I'm not an amateur.

04:45.360 --> 04:46.700
You're welcome.

04:49.400 --> 04:50.940
Over the next couple of weeks

04:51.040 --> 04:55.067
I noticed Adam hanging around
while I was practicing my cello.

04:58.400 --> 04:59.947
You're Mia.

05:00.360 --> 05:02.020
- Yeah.
- Good.

05:02.120 --> 05:03.380
I just wanted to clear that up.

05:03.480 --> 05:04.660
There were rumors.

05:04.760 --> 05:05.820
I'm Adam.

05:05.920 --> 05:07.460
I kno...

05:07.560 --> 05:08.860
Hi.

05:08.960 --> 05:09.980
Wow.

05:10.080 --> 05:11.940
Yo-Yo Ma much?

05:12.040 --> 05:13.020
Kinda.

05:13.120 --> 05:14.260
What's the deal with that?

05:14.360 --> 05:16.500
Is that, like, street or something?
Yo-Yo Mama?

05:16.600 --> 05:17.620
It's Chinese.

05:17.720 --> 05:19.620
And don't mock the master.

05:19.720 --> 05:22.260
- It's blasphemous.
- I'm sorry, my bad.

05:22.360 --> 05:24.430
Hey, I got some tickets
to see a cellist.

05:24.760 --> 05:25.740
Really?

05:25.840 --> 05:28.502
Yeah. You interested?

05:29.760 --> 05:31.140
You're asking me on a date?

05:31.240 --> 05:35.060
Yeah. Well, a friend of the family
had the tickets and can't go.

05:35.160 --> 05:38.743
Anyhow, it's this Friday.
I could pick you up.

05:39.400 --> 05:40.580
What?

05:40.680 --> 05:42.660
You can't hide in that
rehearsal room forever.

05:42.760 --> 05:44.500
It's too late.

05:44.600 --> 05:46.784
I see you.

05:47.440 --> 05:49.180
Hey.

05:49.280 --> 05:50.740
I'm Kim.

05:50.840 --> 05:52.466
Hi.

05:53.040 --> 05:54.871
Okay. I'll see you guys later.

05:56.080 --> 05:57.581
Bye.

05:57.800 --> 06:00.380
Oh, my God!

06:00.480 --> 06:01.460
What?

06:01.560 --> 06:03.500
I told you he was into you.

06:03.600 --> 06:07.540
No, no. He just had a question
about classical music and...

06:07.640 --> 06:09.346
Okay.

06:09.920 --> 06:11.020
Better be nice to you or else

06:11.120 --> 06:12.780
I'll crush him like the bug he is.

06:13.960 --> 06:17.100
God, all right, we get it.
You're in love! Go away!

06:17.200 --> 06:19.140
You got two types of girls
in this world, Mia.

06:19.240 --> 06:20.700
Girls who have boyfriends
in high school...

06:20.800 --> 06:22.780
And girls like us who
wait till college.

06:22.880 --> 06:25.144
So much happier.

06:26.200 --> 06:27.980
I'm totally off the hook.

06:28.080 --> 06:30.660
What are we doing today?

06:30.760 --> 06:33.620
We can go the farm, visit
Henry, Willow and the baby?

06:33.720 --> 06:35.540
Stop by my folks' place
for a late lunch?

06:35.640 --> 06:37.980
Mia, you gonna come with us?

06:38.080 --> 06:39.060
I don't know.

06:39.160 --> 06:40.820
There's this tricky part
of the Beethoven sonata

06:40.920 --> 06:43.980
that I've really gotta nail,

06:44.080 --> 06:46.460
and, well, the letters
were mailed on Friday.

06:46.560 --> 06:47.580
Juilliard.

06:47.680 --> 06:49.700
The audition was two months ago,

06:49.800 --> 06:52.580
but I can still feel
it in my fingers.

06:52.680 --> 06:55.060
Okay, this is painful to watch.

06:55.160 --> 06:57.660
Look, who knows what time the mail's
even gonna be delivered today?

06:57.760 --> 07:00.340
Come on, you got to come with us.

07:00.440 --> 07:02.460
Come on, baby. Pretty soon
you're gonna be off to college,

07:02.560 --> 07:03.820
no matter where you're going.

07:03.920 --> 07:06.340
How many snow days are we gonna
be able to spend together?

07:06.440 --> 07:09.420
Are you really playing
the guilt card right now?

07:09.520 --> 07:10.740
We'll let you pick the music.

07:10.840 --> 07:12.340
And bribery.

07:12.440 --> 07:15.140
Honey, guilt and bribery are
the glue that have held

07:15.240 --> 07:18.260
parents and teenagers
together for generations.

07:18.360 --> 07:20.740
Don't fight tradition.

07:20.840 --> 07:22.260
Fine.

07:22.360 --> 07:23.980
Boom!

07:25.640 --> 07:28.381
I am a passenger

07:29.280 --> 07:31.500
And I ride and I ride...

07:31.600 --> 07:33.940
I thought you said
I'd pick the music.

07:34.040 --> 07:36.900
Oh, yah. She's right, Teddy.
Fire up the jams, sister.

07:37.000 --> 07:38.340
Let's hear something old-school.

07:38.440 --> 07:39.980
How 'bout I kick out a few tunes

07:40.080 --> 07:42.780
from our favorite
Austrian melody maker,

07:42.880 --> 07:44.300
Franz Schubert.

07:44.400 --> 07:46.060
Not that old-school.

07:46.160 --> 07:48.380
Iggy Pop! Iggy Pop!

07:48.480 --> 07:50.620
Teddy, you can listen
to Iggy on your iPod.

07:50.720 --> 07:52.660
But nothing after 1978.

07:52.760 --> 07:54.940
- You understand me, young man?
- Yes, sir.

07:55.040 --> 07:57.580
Well, I choose Ludwig van Beethoven.

07:57.680 --> 07:59.140
Surprise.

08:17.760 --> 08:18.980
I've always wondered if

08:19.080 --> 08:20.140
Mom and Dad were disappointed

08:20.240 --> 08:22.220
that I didn't turn
out more like them.

08:22.320 --> 08:26.020
I tried to. I mean, Mom and I
went to all of Dad's shows.

08:26.120 --> 08:29.420
Dad's band was called Nasty Bruises.

08:29.520 --> 08:31.660
Embarrassing, I know.

08:31.760 --> 08:33.659
They were what you might
call "big" in our town.

08:33.760 --> 08:36.900
And for a while, everyone
thought they might get bigger.

08:39.600 --> 08:42.671
That was my preschool.

08:43.400 --> 08:46.665
But then one day in second grade...

08:51.600 --> 08:53.780
I wanna play it.

08:55.000 --> 08:57.380
Cellos are crazy expensive.

08:57.480 --> 09:00.260
So, I borrowed a crappy
one from school.

09:00.360 --> 09:03.260
Mom and Dad found a student
from a local college to teach me.

09:03.360 --> 09:05.660
And I rehearsed day and night.

09:05.760 --> 09:07.989
I couldn't get enough.

09:08.760 --> 09:10.020
I love her.

09:10.120 --> 09:12.820
But I'm about ready to
stab my eyeballs out.

09:12.920 --> 09:15.020
This is exactly why I
could never procreate.

09:15.120 --> 09:16.780
Amen, sister.

09:20.520 --> 09:23.300
I loved the order.

09:23.400 --> 09:25.660
The structure.

09:25.760 --> 09:30.060
But what really hooked me was
that feeling I got in my chest.

09:31.440 --> 09:34.989
It's like my heart was
beating with the cello.

10:01.400 --> 10:03.265
Dude.

10:04.200 --> 10:07.624
She's been at it since
this afternoon.

10:09.560 --> 10:11.980
You want me to tell her to
hang it up for the night?

10:12.080 --> 10:13.706
No.

10:14.880 --> 10:17.100
You go in there you'd probably
get clubbed with a bow.

10:17.200 --> 10:19.509
I wouldn't risk it.

10:21.040 --> 10:23.260
I wonder where she gets that from.

10:23.360 --> 10:27.460
Naw, guys play music for two reasons.

10:27.560 --> 10:30.740
To get laid and because
they got rage.

10:30.840 --> 10:33.220
But mostly to get laid.

10:33.320 --> 10:36.471
Well, that's probably
not her motivation.

10:37.560 --> 10:39.903
No. Exactly.

10:40.800 --> 10:42.220
She's not doing it to get anything.

10:42.320 --> 10:45.300
She's just doing it out of pure...

10:51.280 --> 10:53.748
We made that.

11:07.040 --> 11:10.940
The next day, Dad came
home with a present.

11:11.040 --> 11:14.350
A cello of my very own.

11:45.880 --> 11:48.460
Isn't it amazing how life
is one thing and then,

11:48.560 --> 11:51.660
in an instant,
it becomes something else?

11:51.760 --> 11:54.300
Like here I am, Mia.

11:54.400 --> 11:56.500
The girl who thinks about
the cello and Adam

11:56.600 --> 12:00.627
and whether a letter is
waiting for me at home.

12:01.120 --> 12:03.270
And just like that...

12:58.400 --> 13:01.220
Get some cribbing in there.
Support those columns.

13:01.320 --> 13:02.420
We need a full spinal immobilization.

13:02.520 --> 13:04.067
Hello?

13:04.400 --> 13:06.100
Our resources are good right now.

13:06.200 --> 13:07.260
Excuse me!

13:07.360 --> 13:09.180
Sir, excuse me?

13:09.280 --> 13:10.620
Hello?

13:18.560 --> 13:20.221
Mom.

13:20.840 --> 13:22.626
Teddy!

13:22.920 --> 13:24.865
Dad!

13:33.240 --> 13:35.300
We have foreshortening
in this left leg.

13:35.400 --> 13:36.901
Yeah.

13:44.280 --> 13:45.980
Do you wanna get a tube in her now?

13:46.080 --> 13:48.180
Just grab the Ambu bag for now.

13:48.280 --> 13:50.270
No!

13:56.640 --> 13:58.580
Wake up!

13:58.680 --> 14:00.511
Wake up.

14:02.120 --> 14:04.110
Wake up.

14:10.520 --> 14:13.068
Go, one, two, three.

14:13.800 --> 14:15.740
Let's move. Her Glasgow
Coma's at a seven.

14:15.840 --> 14:17.580
Tell Portland to have
a trauma team ready.

14:18.480 --> 14:21.620
Glasgow Coma? Why do
you need a trauma team?

14:21.720 --> 14:24.180
One female, late teens, critical,
en route to Portland now.

14:24.280 --> 14:27.260
- One 8-year-old male, conscious.
- Mom! Dad!

14:27.360 --> 14:28.380
Teddy!

14:28.480 --> 14:30.391
Let's go, Demetri.

14:30.760 --> 14:34.070
Hang in there, baby.
We'll be in Portland soon.

14:46.320 --> 14:47.500
You okay?

14:47.600 --> 14:48.620
No.

14:48.720 --> 14:50.620
You wanna hit up my closet?

14:50.720 --> 14:53.302
Your closet's terrifying.

14:53.600 --> 14:55.340
I don't even wanna go.

14:55.440 --> 14:57.260
Come on, he's just a guy, Mia.

14:57.360 --> 15:00.060
Yeah, but he's the first guy I've
ever gone on a maybe-date with

15:00.160 --> 15:03.420
and I don't know whether to wear
date clothes or casual clothes or...

15:03.520 --> 15:06.500
Just wear, you know,
something you feel good in.

15:06.600 --> 15:09.740
And if this Adam dude doesn't see how
amazing you are, then he's a total...

15:09.840 --> 15:10.860
- Shithead.
- Yeah.

15:12.480 --> 15:15.108
Oh, I think I'm gonna puke.

15:17.600 --> 15:20.068
Better before than during.

15:22.480 --> 15:23.580
You must be Adam.

15:23.680 --> 15:25.100
Yeah. I am, yeah.

15:25.200 --> 15:26.420
Nice threads.

15:26.520 --> 15:28.740
Come on in. I'm the old man, Denny.

15:28.840 --> 15:31.020
I know. You were in
Nasty Bruises, right?

15:31.120 --> 15:32.980
Oh, wow,
you're impressing me already.

15:33.080 --> 15:35.100
Well, I have your CDs.

15:35.200 --> 15:36.740
You're the one.

15:36.840 --> 15:39.660
They make great coasters,
right? Come on.

15:39.760 --> 15:41.940
Adam's here!

15:42.040 --> 15:43.100
Is that Mia?

15:43.200 --> 15:45.900
Yeah. That's our
little rock and roll.

15:46.000 --> 15:48.940
She was Nasty Bruises'
original groupie.

15:49.040 --> 15:52.100
Oh, no. Is he telling
you old war stories?

15:52.200 --> 15:53.701
Hey.

15:53.960 --> 15:56.020
- We should probably go.
- 'Kay.

15:56.120 --> 15:57.460
'Kay, you kids be careful out there.

15:57.560 --> 15:59.740
I hear it gets pretty
wild at the symphony.

15:59.840 --> 16:00.940
- Goodbye.
- Bye.

16:01.040 --> 16:02.621
Bye.

16:02.880 --> 16:04.860
Your parents seem pretty cool.

16:04.960 --> 16:07.020
So they tell me.

17:03.280 --> 17:05.180
Seriously, I respect any musician

17:05.280 --> 17:07.140
who just leaves it all
on the stage like that.

17:07.240 --> 17:08.260
She was awesome.

17:08.359 --> 17:10.060
Thought you were a little
bored there in the beginning.

17:10.160 --> 17:12.660
No. That snoring was
the lady next to me.

17:12.760 --> 17:14.944
I loved every minute of it.

17:15.599 --> 17:17.909
All right, Hall,
so what's your story?

17:18.119 --> 17:22.465
How did parents like yours end
up having a kid like you?

17:23.200 --> 17:26.943
Well, I was certainly
bred to be a rocker.

17:27.200 --> 17:29.660
But I have this theory that
I was switched at birth.

17:29.760 --> 17:32.069
Okay. That explains it.

17:33.320 --> 17:35.310
No, but seriously.

17:36.480 --> 17:38.860
I don't know,
I've always kind of felt like

17:38.960 --> 17:42.020
this Martian in my family.

17:42.120 --> 17:44.588
I don't look like
either of my parents.

17:44.800 --> 17:48.900
My mom's this tough chick
and my dad's all outgoing

17:49.000 --> 17:53.300
and I went and chose
Beethoven and the cello.

17:53.840 --> 17:56.220
When I was eight,
I saw this old video

17:56.320 --> 17:59.740
of the Ramones playing
"I Wanna Be Sedated".

17:59.840 --> 18:02.140
And it felt like my head exploded.

18:02.240 --> 18:05.860
And I was like, "I have to
learn to play the guitar."

18:05.960 --> 18:09.589
So, my uncle hooked me
up with this old Fender.

18:11.360 --> 18:15.182
Yeah, that thing saved my life.

18:26.120 --> 18:30.022
You didn't really get those tickets
from a family friend, did you?

18:30.520 --> 18:33.500
That was two weeks
of pizza delivery tips.

18:33.600 --> 18:35.340
Why?

18:36.600 --> 18:37.700
Why me?

18:37.800 --> 18:39.790
Because I like to watch you play.

18:40.000 --> 18:42.548
You go to another place.

18:43.680 --> 18:45.705
And you're beautiful.

18:48.160 --> 18:52.710
You get this crease in
your forehead right there.

18:55.360 --> 18:59.831
Why do I have this feeling you're
about to mess up my entire life?

18:59.960 --> 19:02.701
A little mess never hurt anybody.

19:12.920 --> 19:15.620
A week later, Adam invited
me to see his band play.

19:15.720 --> 19:17.180
Liz, Mia. Mia, Liz.

19:17.280 --> 19:21.227
I got to change the tube on
this amp. I'll see ya in there.

19:21.720 --> 19:23.506
Okay.

19:33.920 --> 19:36.263
One, two, three, four!

19:43.040 --> 19:45.820
I wasn't lookin' for something

19:45.920 --> 19:49.071
To sink my teeth into

19:50.560 --> 19:53.820
I didn't know what I wanted

19:53.920 --> 19:56.548
I never do

19:57.960 --> 19:59.700
I want what you have

19:59.800 --> 20:03.304
I want what you have now

20:03.440 --> 20:05.420
Give it to me

20:05.520 --> 20:12.141
Do you make it look so good
'cause you know what's up?

20:12.960 --> 20:20.060
Do you know exactly what to do?

20:20.160 --> 20:21.900
I want what you have

20:22.000 --> 20:25.540
I want you have now

20:25.640 --> 20:27.380
Give it to me

20:27.480 --> 20:29.380
I want what you have

20:29.480 --> 20:32.940
I want you have now

20:33.040 --> 20:39.060
Give it to me

20:40.920 --> 20:42.910
Thank you and good night.

20:49.160 --> 20:51.340
So, what other bands are you into?

20:52.600 --> 20:54.580
Classical mostly.

20:54.680 --> 20:56.860
Right on. I love classic rock.

21:06.600 --> 21:07.660
Mia!

21:07.760 --> 21:09.820
Hey. Are you okay?

21:09.920 --> 21:11.540
Kinda miscommunicating with people.

21:11.640 --> 21:12.700
The usual.

21:12.800 --> 21:14.940
Yo, Adam. After-party at Darren's.
You comin'?

21:15.040 --> 21:16.420
Yeah. Yeah, we're in. Yeah.

21:16.520 --> 21:18.500
- You in?
- I have my curfew.

21:18.600 --> 21:20.420
- Curfew?
- Yeah.

21:20.520 --> 21:22.021
Okay.

21:23.200 --> 21:25.065
Well, we'll set you loose early.

21:32.280 --> 21:34.780
Thanks for slummin'
it with us tonight.

21:34.880 --> 21:36.780
Yeah. No problem.

21:36.880 --> 21:40.543
Yo, Adam, just kiss her
and let's go, man.

21:40.720 --> 21:43.302
Come on.

21:45.360 --> 21:46.900
We're cool, right?

21:47.000 --> 21:48.260
- You and me?
- Yeah.

21:48.360 --> 21:50.100
We're cool.

21:50.200 --> 21:51.300
Hey, you finally got to meet Liz.

21:51.400 --> 21:53.026
Yeah.

21:53.200 --> 21:55.225
You two have a lot in common.

21:55.360 --> 21:56.907
You ever, like,

21:57.080 --> 21:58.420
hooked up, or...

21:58.520 --> 22:00.260
Actually, I'm glad
you brought that up.

22:00.360 --> 22:02.060
We do have a lot in common.

22:02.160 --> 22:03.940
For instance, we're both

22:04.040 --> 22:05.746
into girls.

22:06.080 --> 22:08.389
She's with Astrid.

22:09.560 --> 22:11.140
Oh, wow!

22:11.240 --> 22:13.220
Go, Astrid.

22:13.320 --> 22:16.266
And now we've got
that out of the way.

22:18.720 --> 22:21.060
I'm bummed you can't
stay out with us tonight.

22:21.160 --> 22:23.264
Yeah, I know.

22:24.760 --> 22:26.420
Mia, just go. Have fun.

22:26.520 --> 22:28.740
- Mom?
- Kat! Get away from the window.

22:28.840 --> 22:30.705
- Dad?
- Sorry.

22:31.360 --> 22:32.820
Like, your mom and dad are
cool with you staying out,

22:32.920 --> 22:35.070
but you don't want to, or...

22:37.400 --> 22:41.791
Look, I think I'm coming
down with something.

22:43.560 --> 22:45.107
Right.

22:45.240 --> 22:49.620
Yeah, well, just give me a
shout when you get over it.

22:49.720 --> 22:51.020
I'll see you around.

22:51.120 --> 22:52.980
- Hey, Adam.
- Mom, get back inside.

22:53.080 --> 22:55.620
We always do these stragglers'
dinners on Sunday.

22:55.720 --> 22:57.260
You should come by some time.

22:57.360 --> 22:58.660
Thanks.

22:58.760 --> 23:00.625
Maybe I'll check it out.

23:04.120 --> 23:07.624
You know, that was wrong
on so many levels.

23:13.920 --> 23:16.220
What? She shouldn't be scared
to hang out with those guys.

23:16.320 --> 23:17.700
They're us.

23:17.800 --> 23:19.660
Exactly.

23:24.760 --> 23:27.228
- Okay, bring her out.
- Behind.

23:28.400 --> 23:31.141
No palpable deformities at this time.

23:31.800 --> 23:33.586
Go, go, go.

23:35.320 --> 23:36.460
What do we got here?

23:36.560 --> 23:37.580
Collapsed lung, broken ribs.

23:37.680 --> 23:38.660
Looks like three.

23:38.760 --> 23:39.740
Abrasions to the legs, face.

23:39.840 --> 23:41.220
Brain contusions,
full extent unknown.

23:41.320 --> 23:42.700
And an internal bleed.

23:42.800 --> 23:44.060
Rest of the family's on the way in.

23:44.160 --> 23:46.700
Ultrasound, X-ray, 12-chem,
type and cross-match.

23:46.800 --> 23:48.700
Let's get the RT down here, please.

23:48.800 --> 23:51.871
On my count. One, two, three.

23:54.840 --> 23:57.100
Hey, excuse me, I need
to check on my family.

23:57.200 --> 24:00.101
It's Kathleen Hall,
Dennis Hall and Theodore Hall?

24:00.840 --> 24:02.830
- Good to go.
- Hello?

24:03.360 --> 24:05.100
Hey, I was trying to look at that.

24:05.200 --> 24:06.580
Ruptured spleen, we need to move.

24:06.680 --> 24:09.340
We're taking Mia Hall
into operating room one.

24:09.440 --> 24:11.420
All right, let's get her in there.

24:11.520 --> 24:12.980
We got to remove the spleen,
drain the lung

24:13.080 --> 24:14.260
and figure out what's
causing the bleed.

24:14.360 --> 24:16.100
If she wants to live,
she better start fighting.

24:16.200 --> 24:18.700
Start fighting? How am I
supposed to start fighting?

24:18.800 --> 24:22.060
Someone just talk to me, please!
Just help me.

24:30.840 --> 24:32.780
Okay, let's go, folks.

24:32.880 --> 24:34.666
Her sutures.

24:35.240 --> 24:36.300
Arterial line set.

24:36.400 --> 24:37.460
Okay, let's get it cleaned up.

24:37.560 --> 24:38.820
Your cut-down tray's almost prepped.

24:38.920 --> 24:40.460
Let's go, let's go.

24:40.560 --> 24:42.140
Thank you.

24:42.240 --> 24:43.620
GCS still looks high.

24:43.720 --> 24:45.824
Am I gonna die?

24:46.560 --> 24:48.710
Is that what this is?

24:49.480 --> 24:51.740
Here's the secret, baby.

24:51.840 --> 24:54.300
You control this whole thing.

24:54.400 --> 24:57.620
If you live, if you die,
it's all up to you.

24:57.720 --> 25:00.871
So, whatever fight you got in you,
you got to pull it out now.

25:06.240 --> 25:08.260
Call the blood bank.
I need two units of O neg.

25:08.360 --> 25:09.620
Keep two on hold.

25:09.720 --> 25:11.220
I think we're gonna need
a lot more than that.

25:11.320 --> 25:13.140
Let's see if we can track
down her relatives, please.

25:13.240 --> 25:14.180
Right away, sir.

25:14.280 --> 25:17.386
One of her parents is on
their way to OR four now.

25:20.920 --> 25:22.467
Dad?

25:22.600 --> 25:24.660
We just have to relieve the swelling.

25:24.760 --> 25:27.342
For a guy who was in such a bad
car wreck, he really lucked out.

25:27.760 --> 25:31.104
Hey, Mia! Look what I
found loitering out front.

25:31.360 --> 25:33.305
Do we want him?

25:35.120 --> 25:36.951
I was hungry.

25:37.720 --> 25:39.980
Well, I'm glad you came.

25:40.080 --> 25:43.860
Because you're hungry and we
have food for you to eat, or...

25:43.960 --> 25:46.064
Well, food to eat is my favorite.

25:46.200 --> 25:49.180
Out of my way, people. I just worked
a double and I need to feast.

25:49.280 --> 25:51.220
I'm eatin' dim sum for a twosome.

25:51.320 --> 25:52.380
Hey, what's up, Willow?

25:52.480 --> 25:55.020
Welcome, Adam. It's nice to see ya.

25:55.120 --> 25:57.380
Play your cards right,
we might make you a regular.

25:57.480 --> 26:00.700
- Okay, Mom, we got it.
- Thanks.

26:00.800 --> 26:02.586
Come on.

26:14.800 --> 26:17.180
Okay, so who is it?
Bobby Schayer from Bad Religion.

26:17.280 --> 26:19.380
- Tim Leitch from FEAR.
- Tim Leitch from FEAR.

26:19.480 --> 26:21.180
- The guy from Dead Moon.
- Andrew Loomis.

26:21.280 --> 26:24.340
And the guy from
The Wipers, Sam Henry.

26:24.440 --> 26:25.620
So if you think about it,

26:25.720 --> 26:29.220
Portland's kind of like a haven for
legendary punk drummers, right?

26:29.320 --> 26:30.420
That's a good point.

26:30.520 --> 26:32.900
Mia, your man knows
his punk rock history.

26:33.000 --> 26:34.626
Thanks.

26:35.960 --> 26:38.580
Oh, my God! Oh, God,
something just stung me.

26:38.680 --> 26:40.260
Who does that?

26:40.360 --> 26:41.380
A bee?

26:41.480 --> 26:43.260
- Babe, are you sure it's a bee?
- Oh, yeah.

26:43.360 --> 26:44.420
We got to get the stinger out.

26:44.520 --> 26:45.580
No, we're not doing that.

26:45.680 --> 26:48.387
Trust me, this is this only
thing I learned in Boy Scouts.

26:57.120 --> 26:58.460
Got it.

27:01.880 --> 27:03.580
Way hotter than tweezers.

27:03.680 --> 27:06.260
Stand down, woman.
You're already knocked up.

27:06.360 --> 27:09.060
You know, you should
get stung more often.

27:09.160 --> 27:10.900
I'm sorry to say that's
the furthest we've gotten

27:11.000 --> 27:13.229
since our first date.

27:13.880 --> 27:17.702
Yeah. Maybe we should
do something about that.

27:18.240 --> 27:21.027
I like where your head's at, Hall.

27:50.880 --> 27:51.980
Adam?

27:52.080 --> 27:53.460
I'm coming up.

27:53.560 --> 27:55.140
No, you cannot come up.

27:55.240 --> 27:56.900
I have something to tell you.

27:57.000 --> 27:59.582
Besides, it's too late.
I'm already climbing.

28:00.600 --> 28:02.590
Oh, God.

28:08.760 --> 28:10.340
Okay.

28:12.800 --> 28:14.500
Oh! Schroeder.

28:24.040 --> 28:25.621
Hey.

28:26.960 --> 28:28.461
Hey.

28:29.040 --> 28:30.860
I thought you went home.

28:30.960 --> 28:32.791
I got lost.

28:36.120 --> 28:39.460
Did you actually learn that
beesting thing from the Boy Scouts?

28:39.560 --> 28:40.860
No, I totally made it up.

28:40.960 --> 28:42.620
I just really wanted
to suck your hand

28:42.720 --> 28:44.660
in front of all your
parents' friends.

28:49.240 --> 28:51.469
What did you want to tell me?

28:52.080 --> 28:53.991
Today was awesome.

28:54.480 --> 28:57.300
You guys are like a real family here.

28:57.400 --> 28:58.900
I don't think I've ever seen
one of those up close.

28:59.000 --> 29:00.740
It's impressive.

29:00.840 --> 29:03.740
Yeah, well, trust me,
it hasn't always been that way.

29:03.840 --> 29:07.060
When I was a kid,
things were so chaotic.

29:07.160 --> 29:10.700
They'd be up late, so I was up late.

29:10.800 --> 29:14.110
And Dad would be on the
road for weeks at a time.

29:14.520 --> 29:17.830
They didn't really get it
together until Teddy was born.

29:18.520 --> 29:21.671
What about you?
What are your parents like?

29:23.000 --> 29:25.707
They're not really a part of my life.

29:25.840 --> 29:30.180
Honestly, I can't remember them ever
being in the same place for a meal.

29:30.280 --> 29:32.940
And if you want to track down the
old man, that's gonna take a while.

29:33.040 --> 29:34.020
So...

29:34.120 --> 29:35.260
Adam.

29:35.360 --> 29:39.387
No, it's cool. I'm good
at being mostly alone.

29:40.680 --> 29:42.784
But that's the thing,

29:44.000 --> 29:46.389
you're not alone.

29:47.040 --> 29:49.065
Not anymore.

29:59.320 --> 30:00.901
Wait.

30:01.200 --> 30:03.100
I need to take it slow, okay?

30:03.200 --> 30:05.145
I love slow.

30:11.000 --> 30:16.980
And meet

30:17.080 --> 30:19.180
Me there

30:19.280 --> 30:25.071
Bundles of flowers,
we wait through the hours of cold

30:28.480 --> 30:31.780
Winter shall howl at the walls

30:31.880 --> 30:36.749
Tearing down doors of time

30:39.280 --> 30:46.265
Shelter as we go...

30:48.040 --> 30:49.020
Is there enough room?

30:49.120 --> 30:50.660
A little more underneath, please.

30:50.760 --> 30:53.388
- Suture.
- There we go.

30:56.440 --> 30:58.100
The surgery's been
going on for hours,

30:58.200 --> 31:00.350
and they're nowhere near done.

31:05.960 --> 31:07.700
I need to find my family.

31:13.520 --> 31:14.620
Kim?

31:14.720 --> 31:16.060
Kim, wait!

31:20.640 --> 31:22.460
I came here as soon as
I could. What happened?

31:22.560 --> 31:24.020
- Is everyone okay?
- We don't know.

31:24.120 --> 31:25.460
Gran. Gramps.

31:25.560 --> 31:28.301
We need to find out what
the hell's going on here.

31:30.640 --> 31:33.220
Excuse me, my name is Estelle Hall.

31:33.320 --> 31:35.700
Our son, Denny Hall,
his wife, Kathleen,

31:35.800 --> 31:37.460
and their two kids got
in a car accident

31:37.560 --> 31:39.980
this morning and we'd like to
find out how they're doing.

31:40.080 --> 31:41.820
- Yes, of course.
- Mr. and Mrs. Hall?

31:41.920 --> 31:43.100
I'm Liddy. I'm your social worker.

31:43.200 --> 31:45.060
I've just been assigned your case.

31:45.160 --> 31:47.220
I am so sorry for what's happened.

31:47.320 --> 31:50.060
Now, I haven't been able to
speak to anyone's doctors yet,

31:50.160 --> 31:53.660
but I do know that Mia and
Dennis are still in surgery.

31:53.760 --> 31:55.980
Most likely they'll be
heading to the ICU.

31:56.080 --> 31:59.060
There is no information on
Kathleen in the system yet.

31:59.160 --> 32:00.540
But Theodore...

32:00.640 --> 32:02.500
- Teddy?
- Yes, Teddy.

32:02.600 --> 32:04.140
He was conscious when he arrived.

32:04.240 --> 32:05.900
He's getting a CAT scan now.

32:06.000 --> 32:08.420
Why don't you make yourselves
as comfortable as you can

32:08.520 --> 32:09.620
and I will come and
get you the second

32:09.720 --> 32:11.660
I have any new information. Okay?

32:11.760 --> 32:13.147
Thank you.

32:13.520 --> 32:15.220
Hey, Henry and Willow
are on their way.

32:15.320 --> 32:17.260
And I tried calling Adam and
left a couple messages,

32:17.360 --> 32:19.100
but I haven't heard anything yet.

32:19.200 --> 32:21.180
There are two types of
people in this world, Kim.

32:21.280 --> 32:22.860
Those who like real coffee,

32:22.960 --> 32:25.780
and those who like froufrou
drinks with ridiculous names.

32:25.880 --> 32:27.420
Wow. You know, I'm not ashamed to be

32:27.520 --> 32:28.700
a cinnamon-spice chai latte lover.

32:28.800 --> 32:29.780
Thank you very much.

32:29.880 --> 32:32.620
Yeah, well, it kind of smells like
Christmas threw up in your mug.

32:32.720 --> 32:34.260
Fine by me.

32:34.360 --> 32:36.340
So, Adam.

32:36.440 --> 32:37.740
Is it awesome?

32:37.840 --> 32:39.540
It feels big.

32:39.640 --> 32:42.940
It's crazy. I can't eat,
I can't sleep.

32:43.040 --> 32:44.220
But...

32:44.320 --> 32:46.940
For starters, I hate
going to his shows.

32:47.040 --> 32:48.300
Do you not like his music, or...

32:48.400 --> 32:49.580
No, I love his music.

32:49.680 --> 32:52.460
He writes these amazing songs, and...

32:52.560 --> 32:54.020
I don't know, when he comes off stage

32:54.120 --> 32:57.700
I just wanna, like,
lick the side of his face.

32:57.800 --> 32:59.620
Oh, baby.

32:59.720 --> 33:01.460
But when I hang out with his crowd,

33:01.560 --> 33:02.780
I just feel like...

33:02.880 --> 33:04.380
Like a fish out of water?

33:04.480 --> 33:05.820
Like a fish on Mars.

33:05.920 --> 33:09.140
Come on, it's not his friends
you're afraid of, it's him.

33:09.240 --> 33:12.140
I mean, he's older, he's in a band.

33:12.240 --> 33:15.061
All those girls surrounding him.
I mean,

33:15.240 --> 33:17.300
it's scary. I get it.

33:17.400 --> 33:19.220
What if it doesn't work out?

33:19.320 --> 33:21.460
You gonna be there to
pick up the pieces?

33:21.560 --> 33:23.425
Every last one of 'em.

33:24.240 --> 33:25.660
But if it gets serious,

33:25.760 --> 33:27.060
you better not turn into
one of those girlfriends

33:27.160 --> 33:29.185
who only speaks in
the first person plural.

33:29.760 --> 33:31.500
"We love the winter."

33:31.600 --> 33:33.590
"We never use deodorant."

33:33.720 --> 33:35.500
"We only like quinoa."

33:35.600 --> 33:38.740
If you ever turn into one of
those girls, I'mma gonna shoot ya.

33:38.840 --> 33:40.260
If I ever turn into
one of those girls,

33:40.360 --> 33:42.430
I'mma gonna give you the gun.

33:47.240 --> 33:48.260
Hey. Mom?

33:48.360 --> 33:50.980
Who's the toughest,
hottest rocker chick you can think of?

33:51.080 --> 33:52.500
- Debbie Harry.
- Okay, cool.

33:52.600 --> 33:54.500
Or Patti Smith or Joan Jett.

33:54.600 --> 33:56.340
Lucinda Williams,
even though she's country.

33:56.440 --> 33:57.660
Kim Gordon.

33:57.760 --> 33:59.660
What's this,
a social studies project?

33:59.760 --> 34:03.548
No, it's for Halloween.

34:03.800 --> 34:05.620
Tonight, with Adam.

34:05.720 --> 34:08.063
Oh, you're going as the rocker chick.

34:08.239 --> 34:09.980
I don't even wanna go.

34:10.639 --> 34:12.380
Bunny rabbit.

34:12.639 --> 34:13.780
What's up?

34:13.880 --> 34:15.580
I wanna dive into Adam's world.

34:15.679 --> 34:17.139
You know, I wanna
be like his friends.

34:17.239 --> 34:19.219
But what if I can't pull it off?

34:19.320 --> 34:21.980
The whole messy punk rocker
live-in-the-moment thing.

34:22.080 --> 34:23.820
Then you return all the clothes
to my closet in the morning

34:23.920 --> 34:25.659
and go about your life.

34:25.760 --> 34:26.900
Baby, it's one night.

34:27.000 --> 34:28.500
Right?

34:28.600 --> 34:30.900
I mean, I know it's not your thing,

34:31.000 --> 34:33.821
but why not try out messy and
in-the-moment and see how it feels.

34:34.440 --> 34:36.829
You might be surprised.

34:45.320 --> 34:47.150
Hey, Adam.

34:49.320 --> 34:52.860
Whoa, Hall. I didn't
think you had it in you.

34:52.960 --> 34:54.219
Whoa, yourself.

34:54.320 --> 34:56.106
I'm Beethoven.

34:56.600 --> 34:57.860
Ludwig.

34:57.960 --> 35:00.189
Come on, let's go.

35:00.520 --> 35:02.385
What's up, Adam?

35:03.240 --> 35:04.780
Debbie Harry always said,

35:04.880 --> 35:08.140
"A shot before showtime
does the trick." So...

35:08.240 --> 35:09.300
Bottoms up.

35:09.400 --> 35:11.060
Oh, I'm good.

35:11.160 --> 35:13.185
Okay. Well,
it's there if you want it.

35:13.640 --> 35:15.740
Yo, Adam. We're goin' on.

35:15.840 --> 35:17.540
Okay. I've gotta go do my set.

35:17.640 --> 35:19.820
No running off with some me wannabe.

35:19.920 --> 35:21.626
I'll try.

35:23.000 --> 35:24.300
Have fun.

35:24.400 --> 35:26.500
Oh, my God, Mia.

35:26.600 --> 35:29.380
You look amazing.
Did you get this in Seattle?

35:29.480 --> 35:31.380
Hey. Wanna bone?

35:31.480 --> 35:32.700
You're frickin'
embarrassing yourself.

35:32.800 --> 35:34.740
Come on, at least give
me your bone number.

35:34.840 --> 35:38.662
Ladies and gentlemen,
Willamette Stone!

35:42.880 --> 35:44.380
Happy Halloween.

35:44.480 --> 35:46.186
Whoo!

35:46.760 --> 35:48.580
Are you coming?

36:01.760 --> 36:06.380
I've gotta say I'm feelin'
better than I should

36:06.480 --> 36:11.065
Don't got a lot, but I
know life is always good

36:11.200 --> 36:12.260
Oh, come on over

36:12.360 --> 36:15.460
Bring some friends
who have the time...

36:15.560 --> 36:16.820
Mia, you have to come.

36:16.920 --> 36:18.020
Wait.

36:18.120 --> 36:21.021
I'm feeling fine...

36:22.320 --> 36:23.620
Hey.

36:23.720 --> 36:25.500
'Scuse me. Move it.

36:25.600 --> 36:30.180
So tell me now,
are you in or are you not?

36:30.280 --> 36:34.900
I don't want to move the world
I just wanna sit on top

36:35.000 --> 36:36.060
Let's raise a glass

36:36.160 --> 36:39.620
Here's to the best and to the worst

36:39.720 --> 36:44.942
Here's to the feelings that
you just can't put to words

36:54.240 --> 36:59.100
We got tonight we got tonight

36:59.200 --> 37:01.420
For the years

37:01.520 --> 37:03.620
For the night

37:03.720 --> 37:06.060
I'm feelin' good

37:06.160 --> 37:08.460
I'm feeling high

37:08.560 --> 37:12.951
I'm feelin' like I've never felt

37:13.320 --> 37:18.220
We got tonight we got tonight

37:18.320 --> 37:22.267
For the years, for tonight...

37:23.720 --> 37:25.460
Bye, Adam. Bye, Rocker Mia.

37:25.560 --> 37:26.700
Bye, you guys.

37:26.800 --> 37:28.347
Bye.

37:31.040 --> 37:32.541
So...

37:33.320 --> 37:35.420
Do you like me like this?

37:35.520 --> 37:37.340
At last, you finally figured it out.

37:37.440 --> 37:39.380
No, come on.

37:39.480 --> 37:42.660
I mean, do you like
me how I am tonight?

37:42.760 --> 37:44.060
You know what I liked?

37:44.160 --> 37:45.780
I liked how into the show you were.

37:45.880 --> 37:47.180
How you actually wanted to dance

37:47.280 --> 37:49.620
and hang outwith us
riffraff afterwards.

37:49.720 --> 37:51.140
That was cool.

37:51.240 --> 37:54.346
Yeah, but do you like me better,

37:54.520 --> 37:56.351
you know,

37:56.760 --> 37:58.940
- like this?
- Better than what?

37:59.040 --> 38:00.660
Better than the normal Mia.

38:00.760 --> 38:04.780
You know, with the hair and
the makeup and the clothing.

38:05.960 --> 38:09.430
Mia, I don't give a shit
about your clothes.

38:09.840 --> 38:11.340
Don't you get it?

38:11.440 --> 38:14.980
The you you are now is the same
you I was in love with yesterday.

38:15.080 --> 38:17.787
The same you I'll be
in love with tomorrow.

38:33.480 --> 38:35.709
Can we go somewhere?

38:37.000 --> 38:38.661
Yeah.

38:51.000 --> 38:52.706
Wow.

38:54.240 --> 38:55.420
What is this place?

38:55.520 --> 38:58.785
It's an old boatworks shed.

39:00.320 --> 39:03.060
One day, me and the band
are gonna fix it up

39:03.160 --> 39:05.867
and we're gonna rehearse
and record here.

39:07.880 --> 39:09.460
It's perfect.

39:11.360 --> 39:13.225
So are you.

39:26.600 --> 39:28.060
Adam.

39:28.160 --> 39:29.707
Yeah?

39:30.840 --> 39:32.671
I've never...

39:33.240 --> 39:35.540
Just think of it like we're
playing music together.

39:35.640 --> 39:36.780
Adam, that doesn't make any sense.

39:36.880 --> 39:39.064
Yes, it does.

39:40.560 --> 39:42.780
All right, well,
take your jacket off.

39:42.880 --> 39:44.541
Okay.

39:51.120 --> 39:52.781
All right.

39:53.280 --> 39:56.670
So we have four strings.

39:56.800 --> 39:59.220
We have the C string

39:59.320 --> 40:01.020
and G,

40:01.120 --> 40:02.826
D

40:03.080 --> 40:04.627
and A.

40:04.800 --> 40:08.380
And if I were to play glissando,

40:08.480 --> 40:10.823
it'd feel like this.

40:12.160 --> 40:15.620
And if I were to play pizzicato,

40:15.720 --> 40:17.551
it'd feel like this.

40:18.400 --> 40:20.020
And if I were to play forte.

40:20.120 --> 40:22.060
I know forte.

40:22.160 --> 40:24.822
I ain't never gonna shut you out!

40:25.120 --> 40:28.191
Everywhere I'm looking now

40:28.440 --> 40:32.387
I'm surrounded by your embrace

40:32.600 --> 40:35.865
Baby, I can see your halo

40:36.200 --> 40:40.341
You know you're my saving grace...

40:47.760 --> 40:49.780
Intensive Care Unit.

40:49.880 --> 40:51.586
Yeah, she is.

40:55.280 --> 40:57.782
How are we, beautiful?

40:58.040 --> 41:01.060
I told 'em that I don't
wanna leave you.

41:01.160 --> 41:03.503
I'm not gonna let you
out of my sight.

41:07.280 --> 41:10.226
We have another one from
the accident, Nurse Davis.

41:12.000 --> 41:14.741
Dad. Thank God.

41:16.160 --> 41:17.700
Oh, my God, George.

41:17.800 --> 41:19.100
Is he going to be okay?

41:19.200 --> 41:20.620
We're updating his chart right now.

41:20.720 --> 41:22.100
The doctor will be in to
speak with you shortly.

41:22.200 --> 41:23.701
Dad?

41:24.280 --> 41:26.460
Where is he?
Where'd you guys take him?

41:26.560 --> 41:28.860
I'll just finish writing the
orders and then she's all yours.

41:28.960 --> 41:30.420
Girl's been through the wringer.

41:30.520 --> 41:33.300
Yeah. And this is the easy part.
Accident like that?

41:33.400 --> 41:35.460
Mom was DOA. Dad died on the table.

41:35.560 --> 41:36.820
Poor kid's waking up an orphan.

41:36.920 --> 41:38.501
If she wakes up.

41:41.200 --> 41:42.700
Mom.

41:42.800 --> 41:44.060
Dad!

41:58.720 --> 42:01.302
I'm getting you!

42:06.560 --> 42:08.186
Whoo!

42:10.920 --> 42:12.420
I love you.

42:24.320 --> 42:25.867
Teddy.

42:43.320 --> 42:45.310
1814...

42:54.920 --> 42:56.421
Teddy.

42:59.960 --> 43:02.300
Hey, little man. Look at this room.

43:02.400 --> 43:04.060
You got the best place in the joint.

43:04.160 --> 43:06.020
Are you okay?

43:06.120 --> 43:09.580
That's right. You just get some rest.

43:09.680 --> 43:11.860
I'm not going anywhere.

43:11.960 --> 43:14.940
Oh, Gran. Hey, I just got here.

43:15.040 --> 43:17.140
They're saying he's
through the worst of it.

43:17.240 --> 43:18.900
They were assigning his room,
so, I thought I'd come here

43:19.000 --> 43:21.460
before I checked in on Kat and Den...

43:21.560 --> 43:23.425
They didn't...

43:24.320 --> 43:26.151
Oh, my God!

43:27.320 --> 43:29.060
Excuse me.

43:37.240 --> 43:39.900
You're mine now, Teddy.

43:40.000 --> 43:44.027
And no matter what,
I will never leave you.

43:45.040 --> 43:47.110
We're gonna make it.

43:52.040 --> 43:54.429
Listen, I need to do something.

43:56.080 --> 43:58.389
But I promise you, Teddy.

44:12.040 --> 44:13.580
Adam.

44:13.680 --> 44:15.705
You came.

44:29.200 --> 44:32.260
Listen. You can't let Teddy
grow up without a family.

44:32.360 --> 44:34.020
You have got to fight.

44:34.120 --> 44:36.860
You can do this. You have to do this.

44:36.960 --> 44:38.020
Mia!

44:38.120 --> 44:39.580
- Excuse me.
- Sir!

44:39.680 --> 44:41.340
- Mia!
- Adam.

44:41.440 --> 44:42.460
Mia!

44:42.560 --> 44:44.061
Mia!

44:52.400 --> 44:55.824
Being with Adam was
like learning to fly.

44:56.920 --> 45:01.311
It was exciting and scary,
all at the same time.

45:03.280 --> 45:07.227
That spring was a magical time.

45:08.120 --> 45:10.140
Adam's band was playing bigger clubs

45:10.240 --> 45:12.380
and festival in different cities.

45:12.480 --> 45:16.420
Once he graduated, they started
getting booked even more.

45:16.520 --> 45:19.671
By the fall, record labels
were taking notice.

45:20.640 --> 45:23.620
People were taking notice of me too.

45:23.720 --> 45:26.460
I was the first high school
student ever invited

45:26.560 --> 45:30.064
to perform solo at the
college's fall recital.

45:33.080 --> 45:35.460
And even though Adam was away a lot,

45:35.560 --> 45:38.900
when he was in town,
we spent all of our time together.

45:39.000 --> 45:41.540
I can't believe I'm stuck
at school for another year.

45:41.640 --> 45:43.540
It'll go by fast.

45:43.640 --> 45:46.100
You still thinking of
applying to Lewis & Clark?

45:46.200 --> 45:49.580
Yeah, of course. I mean,
they have a great music program.

45:49.680 --> 45:51.860
I need someplace with financial aid.

45:51.960 --> 45:55.060
Maybe we can live around
the corner from each other.

45:55.160 --> 45:59.551
Or we could shorten the commute
and get a place together.

45:59.960 --> 46:01.586
Really?

46:03.440 --> 46:06.386
That actually sounds kinda perfect.

46:26.120 --> 46:28.065
- Kid's good.
- Whoo!

46:31.840 --> 46:33.140
Sir, I told you you
can't go in there.

46:33.240 --> 46:35.140
What do you mean I can't go
in there? This is bullshit.

46:35.240 --> 46:36.700
Sir, you can't be in there.

46:36.800 --> 46:38.420
You need to calm down.

46:38.520 --> 46:39.700
ICU visitations are restricted

46:39.800 --> 46:42.700
to immediate family only.
Are you family?

46:42.800 --> 46:44.660
All right, you got me.
I'm not family.

46:44.760 --> 46:46.180
Come on, just let him in!

46:46.280 --> 46:48.066
Do I need to call security?

46:48.320 --> 46:49.901
Adam.

46:59.400 --> 47:00.820
Juilliard?

47:00.920 --> 47:02.940
Just look on the computer like you do

47:03.040 --> 47:05.100
and see what it takes
to get in there.

47:05.200 --> 47:07.180
They say it's the best there is.

47:07.280 --> 47:10.100
Of course it is,
but it's across the country.

47:10.200 --> 47:14.421
You know, and Lewis & Clark has an
amazing performance studies program.

47:14.680 --> 47:18.389
Besides, my whole life is here.

47:33.720 --> 47:35.060
Dad, can I ask you a question?

47:35.160 --> 47:36.420
Always.

47:36.520 --> 47:38.545
Do you ever miss being in your band?

47:39.400 --> 47:41.180
What brought this on?

47:41.280 --> 47:45.340
You always say that you left your
band to become a better dad.

47:45.440 --> 47:48.100
But you were a great dad
when you were in the band.

47:48.200 --> 47:51.060
You didn't have to give up something
you loved so much just for us.

47:51.160 --> 47:54.180
No, baby, I didn't give anything up.

47:54.280 --> 47:55.540
I played that adventure out,

47:55.640 --> 47:58.140
and then it was time for a
new adventure with you guys.

47:58.240 --> 48:00.180
And sometimes you
make choices in life,

48:00.280 --> 48:04.068
and sometimes choices make you.

48:04.720 --> 48:06.540
Does that make any sense?

48:06.640 --> 48:08.820
Yeah. I mean,

48:08.920 --> 48:11.340
I think that the cello was
a choice that made me.

48:11.440 --> 48:13.226
There you go.

48:28.960 --> 48:32.140
Do you think the band
would ever relocate?

48:32.240 --> 48:33.340
No. Why?

48:33.440 --> 48:34.660
I don't know.

48:34.760 --> 48:36.940
To see someplace new.

48:37.040 --> 48:38.666
Maybe New York.

48:39.280 --> 48:41.703
I can't imagine. Portland's
where we're from, you know?

48:44.120 --> 48:45.667
Oh, yeah.

48:51.360 --> 48:52.940
I gotta tell you something.

48:53.040 --> 48:55.702
I have to listen to what
you have to tell me.

48:58.200 --> 49:02.068
I'm going to buy all of these albums.

49:02.640 --> 49:04.980
Whoa. The whole three bucks?

49:05.080 --> 49:07.309
Slow down, big spender.

49:27.000 --> 49:28.100
Whoo!

49:28.200 --> 49:31.860
Whoa, Mom. Seriously,
that just makes me more nervous.

49:31.960 --> 49:33.620
Sorry. Just ignore me.

49:33.720 --> 49:35.300
Yeah. Just pretend we're not here.

49:35.400 --> 49:37.500
Dad, honestly, how was that one?

49:37.600 --> 49:39.100
I thought it was fantastic, Mia.

49:39.200 --> 49:40.460
You say that about everything.

49:40.560 --> 49:42.940
Because you're awesome.
They have to give you an audition.

49:43.040 --> 49:44.580
Yeah, but you don't understand.

49:44.680 --> 49:46.140
This is Juilliard.

49:46.240 --> 49:47.620
This isn't just some punk album

49:47.720 --> 49:50.580
where you can throw music at a
wall and hope it sounds all right.

49:50.680 --> 49:52.181
Whoa.

49:54.240 --> 49:55.500
I'm sorry.

49:55.600 --> 49:57.340
I really didn't mean that.

49:57.760 --> 49:59.860
This is pointless.

49:59.960 --> 50:02.110
I'm not good enough.

50:05.160 --> 50:07.742
I thought the last one was amazing.

50:10.160 --> 50:11.661
Really?

50:13.280 --> 50:15.340
I think I can do better.

50:15.440 --> 50:17.385
Then let's do it.

50:18.960 --> 50:20.100
Okay.

50:20.200 --> 50:21.660
Yeah. Let's do it.

50:35.120 --> 50:37.340
I miss you every time you go.

50:37.440 --> 50:40.580
It'll just be a few days. Maybe more.

50:40.680 --> 50:44.540
Well, I know you guys are
gonna kill it at City Limits.

50:44.640 --> 50:45.660
Are you sure you can't come?

50:45.760 --> 50:47.660
I'm pretty sure I can fit
you in my guitar case.

50:49.160 --> 50:52.231
I would, but I got school.

50:52.600 --> 50:53.580
Wow.

50:53.680 --> 50:55.060
Never thought I'd hear that again.

50:55.160 --> 50:57.020
- Come on, we gotta hit the road.
- Okay.

51:03.360 --> 51:05.540
- I'll be back before you know it.
- Okay.

51:05.640 --> 51:08.060
- Come on. We gotta go.
- We're bringing him back, all right?

51:08.160 --> 51:10.220
- Bye.
- Have fun.

51:10.320 --> 51:11.946
We roll.

51:20.120 --> 51:23.100
So what's the whatty-what
from Austin? Hear from Adam?

51:23.200 --> 51:25.300
No. I called him,
but I haven't heard back.

51:26.680 --> 51:28.580
It's fine. I mean, he's slammed.

51:28.680 --> 51:31.060
Yeah, life on the road.

51:31.160 --> 51:33.344
Don't give me that face.

51:34.840 --> 51:36.705
Speaking of the devil.

51:36.840 --> 51:37.900
Hello?

51:38.000 --> 51:38.940
Hey, babe.

51:39.040 --> 51:40.260
So, you all rich and famous now?

51:40.360 --> 51:41.460
Not yet.

51:41.560 --> 51:43.340
But Merge Records made
an offer to sign us.

51:43.440 --> 51:44.780
It's been crazy.

51:44.880 --> 51:47.260
Shut up. That's amazing, Adam.

51:47.360 --> 51:49.340
Yeah, they're throwing
us a party right now.

51:49.440 --> 51:51.100
Well, I miss you.

51:51.200 --> 51:54.586
Dude! You got champagne
all over my phone!

51:55.920 --> 51:57.581
Hello?

52:52.120 --> 52:54.668
Waiting for the rejection

52:55.040 --> 52:58.060
It comes in waves and
it feels like a throb

52:58.160 --> 53:00.981
You wanted only the ending

53:01.160 --> 53:04.311
But what you got was much too long

53:04.440 --> 53:07.260
I can't be you, you know

53:07.360 --> 53:10.340
My heart is underground

53:10.440 --> 53:13.220
When I believe it was different

53:13.320 --> 53:15.660
I believe we could turn it...

53:15.760 --> 53:17.421
Wait.

53:19.680 --> 53:21.227
Sorry.

53:22.000 --> 53:23.786
Mia, wait.

53:25.400 --> 53:26.380
Sorry, I didn't see ya there.

53:26.480 --> 53:28.420
No worries. Just bringing
food for you guys.

53:28.520 --> 53:30.060
Oh, cool. Thanks.

53:30.160 --> 53:31.700
We're just gettin' ready
for tomorrow night.

53:31.800 --> 53:33.300
It's gonna be a total homecoming.

53:33.400 --> 53:36.300
It's our first gig in town
since we got signed.

53:36.400 --> 53:37.901
Adam.

53:38.240 --> 53:39.821
Yeah?

53:40.680 --> 53:42.830
I applied to Juilliard.

53:44.080 --> 53:45.740
- What?
- Yeah,

53:45.840 --> 53:47.420
it's this amazing school.

53:47.520 --> 53:49.863
Yeah, I know what Juilliard is.

53:51.160 --> 53:52.260
Well, it was just on a whim.

53:52.360 --> 53:54.140
Isn't it in New York?

53:54.240 --> 53:55.420
Yeah.

53:55.520 --> 53:57.340
Well, why didn't you tell me?

53:57.440 --> 53:58.380
Well, I tried

53:58.480 --> 54:01.860
but I figured, why tell
you until it was real?

54:01.960 --> 54:04.060
Okay. So why you telling me now?

54:04.160 --> 54:05.740
Well, I got an audition.

54:05.840 --> 54:08.308
In San Francisco.

54:09.040 --> 54:10.541
Wow.

54:11.000 --> 54:12.220
Wow.

54:12.320 --> 54:14.629
Juilliard. Mia, that's...

54:15.000 --> 54:17.184
Way to go. That's cool.

54:17.640 --> 54:19.860
Yeah, well, I won't get in.

54:19.960 --> 54:21.580
But it's kind of a big deal

54:21.680 --> 54:23.511
that I even got an audition.

54:23.640 --> 54:26.108
Most people don't.

54:27.520 --> 54:30.830
Well, Yo Mama better
watch his back. Right?

54:46.200 --> 54:52.260
I can't get you out of my mind

54:52.360 --> 54:57.780
I can't get you out of my mind

54:59.560 --> 55:01.380
The homecoming concert was different

55:01.480 --> 55:03.780
than any show the band had played.

55:03.880 --> 55:08.226
They were tighter, better,
more confident than ever before.

55:11.400 --> 55:12.620
And Adam seemed,

55:12.720 --> 55:15.905
well, like he was becoming
a full-blown star.

55:29.240 --> 55:35.500
I can't get you out of my mind

55:42.480 --> 55:44.660
They're really good.
I've been following them.

55:44.760 --> 55:46.500
Thanks. Thanks for coming.

55:46.600 --> 55:48.020
Did you like the show?

55:48.120 --> 55:49.860
Good.

55:51.600 --> 55:53.060
- Thanks, guys.
- Aw!

55:53.160 --> 55:54.140
Hey.

55:54.240 --> 55:56.780
You guys were insanely good up there.

55:56.880 --> 55:58.620
Yeah, well, I'm glad
you could make it.

55:58.720 --> 56:00.540
Of course I made it.

56:00.640 --> 56:02.020
- A-bomb.
- Hey, man!

56:02.120 --> 56:03.500
- I can't believe you came!
- What's goin' on, bro?

56:03.600 --> 56:05.660
- Tight set tonight.
- Could I get your autograph?

56:05.760 --> 56:07.300
Yeah, sure.

56:07.400 --> 56:09.265
Oh, wow. Okay.

56:09.600 --> 56:10.620
It says Willamette Stone.

56:10.720 --> 56:12.900
Yeah. I can see that.

56:13.000 --> 56:15.184
There you go. This is cool.

56:24.480 --> 56:25.740
If you're so bored you have to read,

56:25.840 --> 56:28.820
maybe you should've just stayed home.

56:28.920 --> 56:32.020
I'm just trying to get
some homework done.

56:32.120 --> 56:33.580
And researching what phrase

56:33.680 --> 56:36.626
I'm gonna have tattooed
over my left boob.

56:38.840 --> 56:39.940
What's all this?

56:40.040 --> 56:41.060
We got booked last-minute to do

56:41.160 --> 56:42.500
a string of shows in Seattle.

56:42.600 --> 56:45.023
We gotta leave tonight, so...

56:46.200 --> 56:47.260
For how long?

56:47.360 --> 56:48.380
I don't know. Like a week?

56:48.480 --> 56:49.700
Ten days?

56:49.800 --> 56:51.340
It's hard to say.

56:51.440 --> 56:53.500
Yeah, but we had plans.

56:53.600 --> 56:55.260
Remember? For my birthday dinner?

56:55.360 --> 56:57.703
Oh, right. Shit. Sorry.

56:57.880 --> 57:00.420
Well, it's fine. I just
wish you would've told me.

57:00.520 --> 57:02.510
What, like you told
me about Juilliard?

57:03.680 --> 57:05.220
And for the record, I didn't
even hear about the tour

57:05.320 --> 57:07.580
until tonight right
before the show, so...

57:07.680 --> 57:09.420
So that's what "Glad you could
make it" was all about?

57:09.520 --> 57:10.860
That's why you're so pissed at me?

57:10.960 --> 57:12.060
Why would I be pissed about
you going to a school

57:12.160 --> 57:13.260
3,000 miles away?

57:13.360 --> 57:16.900
I'm not going there, Adam.
It's just an audition.

57:17.000 --> 57:19.420
Which you didn't even
tell me about, Mia!

57:19.520 --> 57:21.260
And besides, this isn't
about Juilliard.

57:21.360 --> 57:23.020
This is about you
ditching on our plans.

57:23.120 --> 57:24.746
- You're a liar.
- Whoa!

57:25.200 --> 57:28.420
Screw you, Adam! I haven't
ditched out on anything.

57:28.520 --> 57:30.100
Am I crazy, or did you say that

57:30.200 --> 57:33.021
us getting a place together
would be perfect? Huh?

57:33.200 --> 57:35.140
- It's...
- No, you know what?

57:35.240 --> 57:36.980
It's fine.

57:37.560 --> 57:38.740
Whatever.

57:38.840 --> 57:39.940
What? You get to follow your dreams,

57:40.040 --> 57:42.500
but I can't follow mine unless
I have your permission?

57:42.600 --> 57:44.020
And I just have to sit
here and wait around,

57:44.120 --> 57:46.460
hoping that you'll come
home every few weeks?

57:46.560 --> 57:47.540
How is that fair?

57:47.640 --> 57:49.860
You lied to me, Mia. We had plans.

57:49.960 --> 57:51.780
One minute, it's one thing.
The next minute, it's the other.

57:51.880 --> 57:53.020
I grew up with that shit, okay?

57:53.120 --> 57:55.349
I don't need it.

57:56.040 --> 57:57.500
Even if I do go to Juilliard,

57:57.600 --> 57:59.900
we can figure it out.

58:00.000 --> 58:02.140
Baby, we can text and we can Skype...

58:02.240 --> 58:03.580
Skype? Skype?

58:03.680 --> 58:04.900
Jesus, Mia! Have you ever even

58:05.000 --> 58:06.500
had a long-distance relationship?

58:06.600 --> 58:08.060
It's bullshit.

58:08.160 --> 58:10.980
Okay? It's like dating a ghost.

58:11.080 --> 58:12.980
But Skype, it solves
everything right?

58:13.080 --> 58:14.180
You know, you're so naive, man.

58:14.280 --> 58:15.700
You don't know shit about the world.

58:15.800 --> 58:17.380
I can't believe you
just said that to me.

58:17.480 --> 58:18.900
What, you want me to
write it down for you?

58:19.000 --> 58:21.780
Adam! Sorry, dude, but we gotta jet

58:21.880 --> 58:24.462
if we wanna make it to
the motel before sunup.

58:25.880 --> 58:27.660
No! No. You cannot
leave me like that!

58:27.760 --> 58:29.340
Why didn't you tell me?

58:29.440 --> 58:32.750
Maybe because I am
terrified of losing you!

58:36.560 --> 58:39.666
You know what? You do your thing.
I'm gonna do mine.

58:41.720 --> 58:44.660
Fine, but for the record,
you're the one who's getting in the van.

58:44.760 --> 58:46.220
Yeah, whatever.

59:20.520 --> 59:21.740
Mr. and Mrs. Hall?

59:21.840 --> 59:23.341
Yes.

59:24.640 --> 59:26.700
So, Mia's still unconscious.

59:26.800 --> 59:29.140
The respiratory therapists
are going to run some tests

59:29.240 --> 59:32.260
to see when they can wean
her off the ventilator.

59:32.360 --> 59:34.100
So, that's good news.

59:34.200 --> 59:36.260
If she can breathe on her own.

59:36.360 --> 59:39.700
With comatose patients,
the first 24 hours are critical.

59:39.800 --> 59:41.460
If she shows any
signs of awareness...

59:41.560 --> 59:43.420
- Adam.
- I'm sorry. I gotta go.

59:51.280 --> 59:55.501
Woke up this morning...

01:00:08.240 --> 01:00:13.300
Looked up this morning

01:00:13.400 --> 01:00:19.191
Saw the roses full of thorns...

01:00:25.880 --> 01:00:29.060
The food was good but the
service is a little, you know...

01:00:29.160 --> 01:00:31.380
Well, I'm sorry.
It's just the way things are.

01:00:31.480 --> 01:00:33.903
That's not necessary.

01:00:34.040 --> 01:00:35.780
When are we gonna open presents?

01:00:35.880 --> 01:00:37.300
- Mia?
- That's gonna be fun!

01:00:37.400 --> 01:00:38.460
Yeah, you wanna do that?

01:00:38.560 --> 01:00:40.391
Yeah, sure.

01:00:42.520 --> 01:00:46.547
I've gone all around

01:00:47.360 --> 01:00:53.230
Till there's nothing left to say

01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:03.789
Wrote it all down

01:01:04.160 --> 01:01:10.508
Into something that couldn't be said

01:01:24.280 --> 01:01:27.140
I thought you were supposed to be,

01:01:27.240 --> 01:01:29.020
in Seattle.

01:01:29.120 --> 01:01:31.180
No show tonight so I just

01:01:31.280 --> 01:01:33.305
thought I'd drive down for the day.

01:01:42.320 --> 01:01:44.020
What's that?

01:01:44.120 --> 01:01:45.220
It's a replica.

01:01:45.320 --> 01:01:47.780
Of Jolari Hall in San Francisco.

01:01:47.880 --> 01:01:49.980
Where you'll be
auditioning for Juilliard.

01:01:50.080 --> 01:01:51.900
That's the ceiling.

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:53.980
I put it up there.

01:01:54.080 --> 01:01:55.580
It's intense.

01:01:55.680 --> 01:01:57.700
Yeah. I figured,

01:01:57.800 --> 01:01:59.020
you know, if you
look at it every night

01:01:59.120 --> 01:02:01.941
it wouldn't seem so scary
when you get there.

01:02:04.800 --> 01:02:07.109
What do you want, Adam?

01:02:08.320 --> 01:02:09.420
Mia, I'm sorry.

01:02:09.520 --> 01:02:12.220
- I know, I suck.
- No, no.

01:02:12.320 --> 01:02:14.660
You can't just disappear
from my life like that

01:02:14.760 --> 01:02:16.580
and pop back into it
whenever you feel like it.

01:02:16.680 --> 01:02:18.540
I know. It's just,

01:02:18.640 --> 01:02:21.940
the people in my life have a
habit of disappearing on me

01:02:22.040 --> 01:02:23.540
and when you started making plans...

01:02:23.640 --> 01:02:26.142
You're not gonna lose me.

01:02:27.880 --> 01:02:30.223
Adam, I love you.

01:02:31.680 --> 01:02:34.023
But these last few days

01:02:34.360 --> 01:02:36.220
have been brutal.

01:02:36.320 --> 01:02:37.860
I know.

01:02:37.960 --> 01:02:39.985
I know. For me too.

01:02:48.160 --> 01:02:49.991
Happy birthday.

01:02:52.080 --> 01:02:53.580
Well, at least I know
the wrapping's yours.

01:02:53.680 --> 01:02:55.545
Shut up. And just open it. Come on.

01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:04.707
It's a cello and a guitar.

01:03:04.880 --> 01:03:06.905
Do you get it?

01:03:28.360 --> 01:03:31.181
God, I hate you.

01:03:46.920 --> 01:03:49.620
When did you know you were good?

01:03:49.720 --> 01:03:50.700
Oh, I dunno.

01:03:50.800 --> 01:03:51.820
Liar.

01:03:51.920 --> 01:03:53.060
No! I mean, the guitar! Come on.

01:03:53.160 --> 01:03:55.628
What was, like, the moment?

01:03:56.920 --> 01:03:59.263
Actually, there was one night.

01:03:59.840 --> 01:04:02.468
When we first started playing out.

01:04:03.600 --> 01:04:06.260
Right before the show, Liz talked
me into going to the liquor store

01:04:06.360 --> 01:04:08.828
and getting her a Red Bull.

01:04:10.680 --> 01:04:12.830
So I go in

01:04:13.440 --> 01:04:16.864
and there's this drunk dude
buying a bottle of Jack.

01:04:19.040 --> 01:04:21.463
And I realize it's him.

01:04:22.520 --> 01:04:24.749
It's my old man.

01:04:26.120 --> 01:04:27.700
And I just

01:04:27.800 --> 01:04:29.825
stop cold.

01:04:31.840 --> 01:04:34.380
And he just looks right at me

01:04:34.480 --> 01:04:36.505
and walks out.

01:04:37.040 --> 01:04:39.304
No idea who I was.

01:04:41.640 --> 01:04:43.505
Shit, Adam.

01:04:44.120 --> 01:04:47.700
Then that night,
I played like I was on fire.

01:04:47.800 --> 01:04:50.620
I don't know if I thought I was good.

01:04:50.720 --> 01:04:53.826
I just knew that
nothing else mattered.

01:04:54.720 --> 01:04:56.420
Till now.

01:04:56.520 --> 01:04:58.431
Till you.

01:05:09.560 --> 01:05:11.585
When I play,

01:05:13.200 --> 01:05:14.660
I kind of picture

01:05:14.760 --> 01:05:17.388
myself inside the cello.

01:05:19.200 --> 01:05:20.420
It's like my little house.

01:05:20.520 --> 01:05:22.181
Really?

01:05:25.680 --> 01:05:26.900
Actually, no.

01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:28.900
I'm totally just in it for the guys.

01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:30.501
Oh.

01:05:32.720 --> 01:05:34.740
- I got you, didn't I?
- Yeah.

01:05:34.840 --> 01:05:36.341
Yeah.

01:06:00.440 --> 01:06:03.864
How am I supposed to find
the strength to stay?

01:06:04.720 --> 01:06:07.905
What would it feel like
to wake up an orphan?

01:06:08.600 --> 01:06:11.780
To never smell Dad cooking pancakes?

01:06:11.880 --> 01:06:16.226
To never stand next to Mom quietly
talking as we do the dishes?

01:06:17.680 --> 01:06:19.909
But how could I go?

01:06:22.600 --> 01:06:25.180
The nurse said I control
this whole thing.

01:06:25.280 --> 01:06:27.980
If I live, if I die.

01:06:28.080 --> 01:06:30.070
It's all up to me.

01:06:31.080 --> 01:06:34.345
And that terrifies me
more than anything else.

01:06:39.240 --> 01:06:40.980
Mia Hall.

01:06:41.280 --> 01:06:43.111
Good luck.

01:09:07.279 --> 01:09:09.700
Thanks for driving me, Gramps.

01:09:09.800 --> 01:09:11.825
I mean, that was...

01:09:14.399 --> 01:09:15.901
Thank you.

01:09:16.200 --> 01:09:17.781
Mia.

01:09:19.520 --> 01:09:22.260
I just wanted to tell you that

01:09:22.359 --> 01:09:24.100
I watched your audition.

01:09:24.200 --> 01:09:26.145
From backstage.

01:09:26.359 --> 01:09:27.380
I wasn't too sure

01:09:27.479 --> 01:09:29.660
if that cello was gonna
make it out alive.

01:09:29.760 --> 01:09:31.620
I know. I didn't know I had it in me.

01:09:31.720 --> 01:09:33.267
Well, you do.

01:09:33.399 --> 01:09:34.460
You were fearless.

01:09:34.560 --> 01:09:37.188
You played your guts out up there.

01:09:37.399 --> 01:09:38.901
Mia.

01:09:39.800 --> 01:09:42.380
You've got something special.

01:09:42.479 --> 01:09:44.340
Your dad had it too,

01:09:44.439 --> 01:09:46.500
but I never told him.

01:09:46.600 --> 01:09:49.785
I never made too much
fuss about his music

01:09:50.439 --> 01:09:52.660
and I don't wanna make the
same mistake with you.

01:09:52.760 --> 01:09:54.380
If those Juilliard
people don't take you,

01:09:54.480 --> 01:09:55.860
they are damn fools

01:09:55.960 --> 01:09:58.701
because what you did
up there was magic.

01:10:01.520 --> 01:10:03.545
Thank you, Gramps.

01:10:18.560 --> 01:10:21.825
I spend these hollow nights

01:10:22.120 --> 01:10:25.146
All alone

01:10:28.840 --> 01:10:32.150
Safe from the looking glass

01:10:32.320 --> 01:10:35.824
Which you kept home

01:10:39.240 --> 01:10:41.980
I saw the sea and knew

01:10:42.080 --> 01:10:46.426
It was a mirage

01:10:49.480 --> 01:10:52.460
It wasn't even so

01:10:52.560 --> 01:10:56.348
I played the odds

01:10:58.160 --> 01:11:00.700
I never wanted to go

01:11:00.800 --> 01:11:03.302
And now I'm letting you know

01:11:03.480 --> 01:11:05.340
I just wanted to feel

01:11:05.440 --> 01:11:10.740
The life in me

01:11:15.200 --> 01:11:17.020
Oh, hey! You're back.

01:11:17.120 --> 01:11:19.580
That was a really
beautiful song, Adam.

01:11:19.680 --> 01:11:21.705
It's gettin' there.

01:11:22.520 --> 01:11:23.540
How'd it go?

01:11:23.640 --> 01:11:25.300
Did you kill the audition?

01:11:25.400 --> 01:11:28.100
Are they gonna let you in
on a full scholarship?

01:11:28.200 --> 01:11:30.460
I did all right, I guess.

01:11:30.560 --> 01:11:32.140
But it's kinda like

01:11:32.240 --> 01:11:33.620
playing to statues.

01:11:33.720 --> 01:11:36.020
Oh, come on. I bet you
did better than you think.

01:11:36.120 --> 01:11:37.985
And if not...

01:11:39.800 --> 01:11:41.660
Actually...

01:11:41.760 --> 01:11:46.106
Adam, I played better than
I have in my entire life.

01:11:47.040 --> 01:11:51.260
It was like I was possessed
and the music, it just...

01:11:51.360 --> 01:11:54.022
it poured out of me.

01:11:54.440 --> 01:11:58.387
God. I've never felt
anything like that before.

01:11:59.480 --> 01:12:00.981
Wow.

01:12:01.760 --> 01:12:04.103
I wish I could've seen that.

01:12:04.840 --> 01:12:06.830
Yeah, me too.

01:12:08.320 --> 01:12:11.505
You know, for once, I actually felt

01:12:11.760 --> 01:12:14.069
like I could do this.

01:12:15.760 --> 01:12:19.540
Why didn't you call me
after the audition to brag?

01:12:19.640 --> 01:12:22.825
I know I should have, but...

01:12:24.200 --> 01:12:25.180
I don't wanna fight, okay?

01:12:25.280 --> 01:12:27.111
I know. I don't wanna fight.

01:12:30.440 --> 01:12:32.900
Okay, well, you played better
than you have in your entire life.

01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:34.990
We should celebrate.

01:12:44.440 --> 01:12:47.340
So how come you've never
written a song for me?

01:12:47.440 --> 01:12:49.020
I don't know, I'm no good at writing

01:12:49.120 --> 01:12:50.860
about things that make me happy.

01:12:50.960 --> 01:12:52.300
If you want a song,
you're gonna have to, like,

01:12:52.400 --> 01:12:53.500
cheat on me or something.

01:12:53.600 --> 01:12:55.180
What do I have to do
for a whole album?

01:12:55.280 --> 01:12:57.140
Come on. Don't get greedy.

01:13:01.520 --> 01:13:03.180
You know, I don't
think I'll even get in.

01:13:03.280 --> 01:13:05.020
There were like 100 other kids there.

01:13:05.120 --> 01:13:07.860
Then I don't have to choose, right?

01:13:07.960 --> 01:13:11.540
But if you do get in, the choice
is already made, isn't it?

01:13:11.640 --> 01:13:13.860
Mia, come on. I'm not
gonna be that asshole

01:13:13.960 --> 01:13:16.340
that stops you from
going to Juilliard.

01:13:16.440 --> 01:13:19.100
If it was me, you'd let me go.

01:13:19.200 --> 01:13:22.146
Yeah, but in a way, I already have.

01:13:22.360 --> 01:13:24.540
You know, you're going
to your own Juilliard.

01:13:24.640 --> 01:13:26.426
Yeah, I know.

01:13:26.960 --> 01:13:28.985
But I'm still here.

01:13:29.880 --> 01:13:33.145
Okay? And I'm still
crazy in love with you.

01:13:34.680 --> 01:13:36.909
Yeah, me too.

01:13:55.840 --> 01:13:57.740
There you are.

01:13:57.840 --> 01:14:00.342
Been looking everywhere for you.

01:14:02.520 --> 01:14:05.420
Guess your big show
got canceled, huh?

01:14:05.520 --> 01:14:07.670
Like I give a shit.

01:14:08.480 --> 01:14:10.580
- Oh, I'm sorry. I'm just...
- No, it's fine.

01:14:10.680 --> 01:14:12.420
I get it.

01:14:17.440 --> 01:14:19.829
The first day, man.

01:14:20.880 --> 01:14:23.660
The first day I walked past that room

01:14:23.760 --> 01:14:26.228
and saw her playing, that was it.

01:14:30.560 --> 01:14:32.100
God, I'm such an asshole.

01:14:32.200 --> 01:14:34.543
No, Adam. Don't.

01:14:39.320 --> 01:14:42.471
She get in? To Juilliard?

01:14:43.840 --> 01:14:45.546
I don't know.

01:14:45.720 --> 01:14:48.060
Letters sent out Friday.

01:14:48.160 --> 01:14:50.867
I think she was
supposed to hear today.

01:14:51.840 --> 01:14:53.260
I can't.

01:14:53.360 --> 01:14:55.749
I can't lose her again.

01:14:57.920 --> 01:14:59.581
Let's go.

01:15:20.440 --> 01:15:21.941
What now?

01:15:22.600 --> 01:15:24.943
Well, I gotta get in there.
I gotta see her.

01:15:31.600 --> 01:15:32.660
Excuse me.

01:15:32.760 --> 01:15:35.060
Hi, there's this girl
and she's having a baby

01:15:35.160 --> 01:15:37.260
in the bathroom on the third floor.

01:15:37.360 --> 01:15:38.860
And she's down there
and she's just grunting

01:15:38.960 --> 01:15:40.700
and screaming and there's
blood everywhere!

01:15:40.800 --> 01:15:41.980
And it's really unsanitary,

01:15:42.080 --> 01:15:43.540
and we really need someone
down there right now.

01:15:43.640 --> 01:15:44.660
Okay...

01:15:44.760 --> 01:15:47.300
We really need someone
down there right now!

01:15:47.400 --> 01:15:49.231
- Shit!
- Go!

01:15:54.880 --> 01:15:57.460
Excuse me, young man,
I've told you you can't be here.

01:15:57.560 --> 01:15:58.620
Security, get me Security. Right now.

01:15:58.720 --> 01:16:00.631
Mia Hall?

01:16:02.040 --> 01:16:04.460
Please, I just wanna
feel you touch me.

01:16:04.560 --> 01:16:06.664
- Mia.
- Please.

01:16:07.320 --> 01:16:09.460
- Hands off.
- Come on.

01:16:09.560 --> 01:16:11.300
What are you doing? Get off me!

01:16:11.400 --> 01:16:13.823
You can't do this to him!

01:16:14.080 --> 01:16:16.340
You know, I tried to
do this the nice way.

01:16:16.440 --> 01:16:18.460
You wouldn't know nice if
it bit you in the ass, lady.

01:16:18.560 --> 01:16:20.585
Hey. Knock it off.

01:16:20.760 --> 01:16:22.460
- Willow?
- Willow?

01:16:22.560 --> 01:16:23.860
What the hell is going on?

01:16:23.960 --> 01:16:25.220
They were trying to
break into the ICU.

01:16:25.320 --> 01:16:28.100
Yeah, 'cause Jabba the Nurse
wouldn't let us in to see Mia.

01:16:28.200 --> 01:16:30.620
Well, I know these kids personally,
so, why don't you just let me

01:16:30.720 --> 01:16:32.745
handle it from here.

01:16:33.840 --> 01:16:37.310
Fine. Then just keep
them in the waiting room.

01:16:41.200 --> 01:16:42.900
What the hell were you guys thinking?

01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:45.150
I need to see Mia.

01:16:46.960 --> 01:16:49.861
Well, she's gonna need
you now more than ever.

01:16:52.080 --> 01:16:54.070
Hey, what's going on?

01:16:54.640 --> 01:16:56.949
Willow, what's happening?

01:16:58.200 --> 01:17:00.190
Willow, why aren't you with Teddy?

01:17:00.760 --> 01:17:02.307
Willow.

01:17:03.200 --> 01:17:05.100
Oh, shit.

01:17:05.200 --> 01:17:06.826
Teddy!

01:17:12.840 --> 01:17:14.785
Mr. and Mrs. Hall.

01:17:15.280 --> 01:17:17.703
- Teddy.
- I'm Dr. DeVenne.

01:17:18.200 --> 01:17:20.300
- Teddy?
- I am so sorry.

01:17:20.400 --> 01:17:21.620
Where is he?

01:17:21.720 --> 01:17:24.140
He had an epidural
hemorrhage in the brain.

01:17:24.240 --> 01:17:26.460
We did everything we
could to save him.

01:17:26.560 --> 01:17:28.346
No!

01:17:32.240 --> 01:17:35.700
He will never graduate
from T-ball to baseball.

01:17:35.800 --> 01:17:38.143
And never learn to drive.

01:17:38.480 --> 01:17:39.740
Never kiss a girl.

01:17:39.840 --> 01:17:41.140
You can't catch me!

01:17:41.240 --> 01:17:43.071
Never fall in love.

01:17:48.240 --> 01:17:50.105
God!

01:17:52.320 --> 01:17:54.868
I don't wanna... I don't wanna...

01:17:56.320 --> 01:17:57.940
God, I don't wanna...

01:17:58.040 --> 01:17:59.740
I don't wanna do this anymore.

01:17:59.840 --> 01:18:02.069
I want this to be over!

01:18:16.040 --> 01:18:17.060
Give me the chart.

01:18:17.160 --> 01:18:18.340
Abdomen's rigid. Full of fluid.

01:18:18.440 --> 01:18:21.420
Jesus. Splenectomy,
brain contusions, collapsed lung.

01:18:21.520 --> 01:18:24.140
- We gotta run.
- BP and pulse ox are dropping.

01:18:24.240 --> 01:18:26.420
Okay, let's get her back in surgery.
Let's go, come on.

01:18:26.520 --> 01:18:28.660
Get out of the way.
Swipe the door, please.

01:18:28.760 --> 01:18:31.308
- Get that elevator.
- Out of the way!

01:18:32.240 --> 01:18:34.265
They know we're coming?

01:18:35.640 --> 01:18:38.540
All right, sweetheart.
We can only carry you so far.

01:18:38.640 --> 01:18:40.983
After that, it's all you.

01:18:44.320 --> 01:18:46.106
Oh, my God. Mia.

01:18:49.440 --> 01:18:51.430
- Oh, my God.
- Adam.

01:18:52.240 --> 01:18:54.265
Goodbye, Adam.

01:19:01.920 --> 01:19:03.420
It's almost time. It's almost time.

01:19:03.520 --> 01:19:05.460
I'll take some of that. Yeah.

01:19:05.560 --> 01:19:07.505
- Do not!
- Thank you!

01:19:08.160 --> 01:19:09.991
Cheers.

01:19:11.400 --> 01:19:13.020
Nine, eight, seven, six...

01:19:13.120 --> 01:19:15.180
- There you are!
- Here I am!

01:19:15.280 --> 01:19:17.180
...five, four...

01:19:17.280 --> 01:19:19.740
three, two, one.

01:19:19.840 --> 01:19:21.900
Happy New Year!

01:19:25.160 --> 01:19:28.740
"Even when they were
just wasting time

01:19:28.840 --> 01:19:30.700
"they weren't wasting time.

01:19:30.800 --> 01:19:34.463
"It was as if no time they spent
together could ever be wasted."

01:19:34.760 --> 01:19:35.740
Who said that?

01:19:35.840 --> 01:19:37.500
Some guy in some book.

01:19:37.600 --> 01:19:38.900
And what was he talking about?

01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:40.860
Some couple in some movie.

01:19:40.960 --> 01:19:41.940
My point is...

01:19:42.040 --> 01:19:43.180
Yes, maestro?

01:19:43.280 --> 01:19:47.020
My point is he could have
been talking about us.

01:19:47.120 --> 01:19:49.110
That he could.

01:20:02.280 --> 01:20:03.420
Promise me.

01:20:03.520 --> 01:20:05.300
I promise you.

01:20:05.400 --> 01:20:07.311
Wait, what am I promising?

01:20:08.040 --> 01:20:10.861
That we'll spend next
New Year's together.

01:20:12.200 --> 01:20:14.780
Even if we're in different places,
you'll still be with me.

01:20:14.880 --> 01:20:16.700
No, that's not good enough.
Not Skyping,

01:20:16.800 --> 01:20:19.300
not texting, together.

01:20:19.400 --> 01:20:22.904
Baby, you know we can't
promise each other that.

01:20:24.720 --> 01:20:27.666
I guess we both know
where this is heading.

01:20:40.920 --> 01:20:42.865
Yeah, I guess so.

01:20:51.840 --> 01:20:53.660
The old thing...

01:20:53.760 --> 01:20:55.180
- All right.
- Delicious!

01:20:55.280 --> 01:20:57.020
What are you looking at?

01:20:57.120 --> 01:20:59.420
Because we're fascinated.

01:20:59.520 --> 01:21:00.580
- You!
- Fascinating.

01:21:00.680 --> 01:21:03.260
You're a spatula man now.

01:21:03.360 --> 01:21:05.300
- Look it, a drummer.
- He's totally drumming with it.

01:21:05.400 --> 01:21:07.340
Come on, give me your plate.
All right, get ready.

01:21:07.440 --> 01:21:08.900
Hey! There she is.

01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:10.020
Hey!

01:21:10.120 --> 01:21:11.660
Happy New Year!

01:21:11.760 --> 01:21:13.140
If you're still drunk,
you're totally grounded.

01:21:13.240 --> 01:21:14.980
If not, I'm gonna let it slide.

01:21:15.080 --> 01:21:16.300
I'm definitely not drunk.

01:21:16.400 --> 01:21:18.860
Well, you were still out all
night so come on. Spill.

01:21:18.960 --> 01:21:20.180
How was the party?

01:21:20.280 --> 01:21:21.540
Fine.

01:21:21.640 --> 01:21:23.551
How was Adam?

01:21:27.960 --> 01:21:31.140
Okay, everybody. Let's move
this party to another room.

01:21:31.240 --> 01:21:32.500
Let's go.

01:21:32.600 --> 01:21:34.540
Take your mimosas.

01:21:34.640 --> 01:21:36.904
We'll go watch the Rose Parade.

01:21:37.480 --> 01:21:40.142
Come on. Let's go.

01:21:49.320 --> 01:21:50.860
I'm sorry.

01:21:50.960 --> 01:21:52.380
Oh, God, it's gross.

01:21:52.480 --> 01:21:54.470
It's not gross.

01:21:55.000 --> 01:21:56.911
Oh, God.

01:21:57.280 --> 01:21:58.380
You wash, I'll dry.

01:21:58.480 --> 01:21:59.660
Yeah.

01:21:59.760 --> 01:22:01.340
Make us feel better.

01:22:01.440 --> 01:22:03.829
Warm water, soap.

01:22:05.920 --> 01:22:07.180
Oh, God.

01:22:07.280 --> 01:22:09.700
I'm such a mess.

01:22:09.800 --> 01:22:11.940
You know, we had this

01:22:12.040 --> 01:22:14.668
perfect year and a half together.

01:22:16.920 --> 01:22:21.740
And now, we're just moving
in different directions.

01:22:21.840 --> 01:22:23.705
Is it over?

01:22:24.360 --> 01:22:26.021
Yeah.

01:22:30.040 --> 01:22:31.780
You're supposed to
break up with someone

01:22:31.880 --> 01:22:33.300
because you're not in love with them.

01:22:33.400 --> 01:22:35.948
Not because you're completely
in love with them.

01:22:39.720 --> 01:22:41.700
But what do I know, right?
I'm only 17.

01:22:41.800 --> 01:22:43.900
You know plenty.

01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:46.940
It's just very inconvenient to
fall in love when you're 17.

01:22:47.040 --> 01:22:48.500
Especially if it's the real thing.

01:22:48.600 --> 01:22:51.500
You know, if we weren't musicians,
we could just...

01:22:51.600 --> 01:22:54.260
We could just go to college together.

01:22:54.360 --> 01:22:55.980
You know, like normal people do.

01:22:56.080 --> 01:22:57.660
There's no such thing as normal, Mia.

01:22:57.760 --> 01:22:58.860
Every relationship is rough.

01:22:58.960 --> 01:22:59.940
I don't have to tell you that.

01:23:00.040 --> 01:23:01.060
Yeah, I know.

01:23:01.160 --> 01:23:02.220
Don't blame it on music.

01:23:02.320 --> 01:23:04.743
Yeah, but music's the
reason we're breaking up.

01:23:05.720 --> 01:23:08.660
That is bullshit, Mia. You know that.

01:23:08.760 --> 01:23:11.069
What am I gonna do?

01:23:11.760 --> 01:23:14.786
I am being completely torn in half.

01:23:16.240 --> 01:23:17.820
You're going to go to Juilliard

01:23:17.920 --> 01:23:19.910
and play the hell out of your cello.

01:23:20.760 --> 01:23:23.103
Or you're not.

01:23:23.680 --> 01:23:25.140
You're gonna stay with Adam

01:23:25.240 --> 01:23:27.420
and have lots of amazing adventures.

01:23:27.520 --> 01:23:29.140
Or you're not.

01:23:29.240 --> 01:23:32.180
Or maybe tomorrow, the Earth's
gonna smash into a meteor.

01:23:32.280 --> 01:23:34.145
Or it's not.

01:23:34.360 --> 01:23:37.740
Life is this big fat
gigantic stinking mess.

01:23:37.840 --> 01:23:40.468
But that's the beauty of it too.

01:23:41.600 --> 01:23:43.860
Whatever you do, I support you.

01:23:43.960 --> 01:23:46.110
Either way, you win.

01:23:46.600 --> 01:23:49.546
And also either way there's
something that you lose.

01:23:51.440 --> 01:23:53.783
What can I say, baby?

01:23:54.200 --> 01:23:56.782
True love's a bitch.

01:24:56.040 --> 01:24:57.701
Gramps.

01:24:59.520 --> 01:25:01.704
Gramps, what do I do?

01:25:08.240 --> 01:25:10.620
I've been trying to think

01:25:10.720 --> 01:25:15.191
of what Denny would
want me to say to you.

01:25:15.520 --> 01:25:17.704
The kid was a helluva
of dad, wasn't he?

01:25:18.440 --> 01:25:20.942
He sure had me beat.

01:25:21.600 --> 01:25:26.549
I remember the day
that he quit the band.

01:25:27.760 --> 01:25:30.460
He just up and said,

01:25:30.560 --> 01:25:33.791
"That's it. The time has come."

01:25:35.040 --> 01:25:37.542
I was surprised.

01:25:38.720 --> 01:25:42.429
I never really liked the
way the band sounded,

01:25:43.080 --> 01:25:45.140
but I knew how important
it was to him.

01:25:45.240 --> 01:25:49.142
And so I asked him, I said,
"Why are you quitting?"

01:25:49.560 --> 01:25:51.820
And he said,

01:25:51.920 --> 01:25:55.500
"You make sacrifices for your kids.

01:25:55.600 --> 01:25:57.864
"For your kids."

01:25:58.720 --> 01:26:00.500
He said that without even blinking.

01:26:00.600 --> 01:26:02.660
That's why he quit the band.

01:26:02.760 --> 01:26:04.220
For Teddy.

01:26:04.320 --> 01:26:06.060
For you.

01:26:06.760 --> 01:26:09.900
It was when he heard
you play so well.

01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:12.901
I think that's when
it clicked for him.

01:26:13.640 --> 01:26:16.700
Your incredible talent, it...

01:26:16.800 --> 01:26:20.420
He just couldn't believe it.

01:26:20.520 --> 01:26:24.660
And all he wanted to do
was to give you more.

01:26:24.760 --> 01:26:26.820
So, he quit the band,

01:26:26.920 --> 01:26:29.184
he sold his drum kit

01:26:29.800 --> 01:26:31.950
and he bought you that cello.

01:26:33.440 --> 01:26:35.465
Sacrifice.

01:26:35.840 --> 01:26:38.991
That's what we do for the
people that we love.

01:26:40.680 --> 01:26:43.103
And here's mine, Mia.

01:26:43.520 --> 01:26:45.784
I want you to live.

01:26:45.960 --> 01:26:48.340
I want that more than
anything in this world.

01:26:48.440 --> 01:26:52.467
I want you to fight like
hell to stay with us.

01:26:53.320 --> 01:26:56.380
But, with everybody else gone,

01:26:56.480 --> 01:26:58.540
I know it might not be what you want.

01:26:58.640 --> 01:27:03.304
It might be too hard for
you to keep fighting, so...

01:27:05.800 --> 01:27:08.029
If you wanna go,

01:27:08.960 --> 01:27:11.667
I want you to know it's okay.

01:27:12.200 --> 01:27:14.065
It's okay.

01:27:17.160 --> 01:27:19.503
I understand.

01:27:30.520 --> 01:27:32.510
Thank you.

01:27:40.040 --> 01:27:41.666
Gramps?

01:28:35.400 --> 01:28:37.061
Hey.

01:28:38.880 --> 01:28:40.620
Hey.

01:28:44.840 --> 01:28:46.620
So many people have come to see you

01:28:46.720 --> 01:28:49.621
I've lost count of them all.

01:28:50.440 --> 01:28:54.180
There are like 30 people

01:28:54.280 --> 01:28:56.305
in that waiting room.

01:28:59.240 --> 01:29:02.664
Some are related to
you and some aren't,

01:29:03.680 --> 01:29:06.023
but we're your family.

01:29:08.080 --> 01:29:11.345
You still have a family, Mia.

01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:24.831
Look.

01:29:26.160 --> 01:29:28.700
This is my favorite picture of you.

01:29:28.800 --> 01:29:30.301
Ever.

01:29:32.120 --> 01:29:34.110
You were so happy that day.

01:29:38.000 --> 01:29:40.264
And no matter what,

01:29:40.640 --> 01:29:43.825
that's the way I'm always
gonna remember you.

01:29:51.800 --> 01:29:55.940
The best day of my life was
one I never even saw coming.

01:29:56.040 --> 01:29:57.220
It was Labor Day,

01:29:57.320 --> 01:30:01.029
early this fall before things
started to go bad with Adam.

01:30:01.160 --> 01:30:05.062
In some ways, it was just
like a usual potluck dinner.

01:30:05.520 --> 01:30:07.780
But there was a special feel to it.

01:30:07.880 --> 01:30:09.900
People kept on showing up.

01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:12.380
All the old friends
from Dad's band days

01:30:12.480 --> 01:30:15.580
and all the new ones
from Adam's band.

01:30:15.680 --> 01:30:18.820
Willow and Henry were there
with their newborn baby.

01:30:18.920 --> 01:30:21.420
Dad hauled the barbecue
out of the basement

01:30:21.520 --> 01:30:23.940
and he and Teddy spent
the day flipping burgers.

01:30:24.040 --> 01:30:25.900
And when it started to get dark

01:30:26.000 --> 01:30:29.060
Henry had the bright
idea to start a bonfire.

01:30:38.040 --> 01:30:39.541
Mia!

01:30:42.400 --> 01:30:44.580
No way! I'm not playing for you guys.

01:30:44.680 --> 01:30:46.260
Not for us, with us.

01:30:46.360 --> 01:30:47.820
Seriously, Mia, if you don't, I will.

01:30:47.920 --> 01:30:50.340
And have you ever heard the
sound of a thousand dying cats?

01:30:50.440 --> 01:30:53.068
Come on, Hall.
We're playing together.

01:30:53.680 --> 01:30:56.023
I really hate you all.

01:31:02.360 --> 01:31:03.580
All right, Mia.

01:31:03.680 --> 01:31:05.306
Gotta play for us, Mia.

01:31:21.800 --> 01:31:25.140
I've always thought of the
cello as a solo instrument.

01:31:25.240 --> 01:31:28.220
It's probably why it's always
made me so comfortable.

01:31:28.320 --> 01:31:30.310
Just me and my cello.

01:31:31.600 --> 01:31:33.900
But that night,
sitting around the bonfire,

01:31:34.000 --> 01:31:36.660
jamming with Adam and everyone else,

01:31:36.760 --> 01:31:38.460
I realized I was wrong.

01:31:38.560 --> 01:31:41.500
The cello isn't a solo instrument.

01:31:41.600 --> 01:31:43.380
It's part of something bigger.

01:31:43.480 --> 01:31:46.780
Today is the greatest

01:31:46.880 --> 01:31:48.980
Day I've ever known

01:31:49.080 --> 01:31:52.540
Can't live for tomorrow

01:31:52.640 --> 01:31:54.860
Tomorrow's much too long

01:31:54.960 --> 01:31:59.146
I'll burn my eyes out

01:32:00.920 --> 01:32:05.106
Before I get out

01:32:06.520 --> 01:32:09.546
I wanted more

01:32:12.280 --> 01:32:17.183
Than life could ever grant me

01:32:17.960 --> 01:32:21.589
Bored by the chore

01:32:23.800 --> 01:32:27.861
Of saving face

01:32:29.560 --> 01:32:33.020
Today is the greatest

01:32:33.120 --> 01:32:35.220
Day I've never known

01:32:35.320 --> 01:32:38.820
Can't wait for tomorrow

01:32:38.920 --> 01:32:41.020
I might not have that long

01:32:41.120 --> 01:32:45.466
I'll tear my heart out

01:32:46.960 --> 01:32:51.704
Before I get out

01:33:00.080 --> 01:33:01.700
The thing is, Mom and Dad

01:33:01.800 --> 01:33:03.220
always had their scene.

01:33:03.320 --> 01:33:04.980
And Adam had his.

01:33:05.080 --> 01:33:08.660
And I was always jealous
because I didn't have mine.

01:33:08.760 --> 01:33:11.342
Until the night of the bonfire.

01:33:11.520 --> 01:33:13.670
That was my scene.

01:33:13.920 --> 01:33:15.380
That was where I belonged.

01:33:19.520 --> 01:33:22.182
That's what happiness felt like.

01:33:24.840 --> 01:33:27.502
But that could never exist again.

01:35:29.160 --> 01:35:31.901
Just after this piece.

01:36:16.400 --> 01:36:18.026
Adam.

01:36:33.320 --> 01:36:34.660
Mia.

01:36:34.760 --> 01:36:35.780
Don't.

01:36:35.880 --> 01:36:37.711
Stay.

01:36:39.840 --> 01:36:42.940
I know a huge part of your
life is forever ruined

01:36:43.040 --> 01:36:45.780
because of what happened today.

01:36:45.880 --> 01:36:48.500
I'm not dumb enough to
think that I can fix it.

01:36:48.600 --> 01:36:50.590
You can't.

01:36:51.240 --> 01:36:53.469
But I went to your house.

01:36:54.240 --> 01:36:58.062
And I had to climb up the balcony
to get in like I used to.

01:36:59.680 --> 01:37:02.911
And I found this in your mail slot.

01:37:04.120 --> 01:37:06.220
I totally broke and entered
and stole your mail,

01:37:06.320 --> 01:37:08.743
so the Feds might be comin' after me.

01:37:20.960 --> 01:37:22.500
"Dear Mia,

01:37:22.600 --> 01:37:25.387
"it gives me tremendous pleasure..."

01:37:28.600 --> 01:37:30.829
Mia, you got in.

01:37:31.920 --> 01:37:34.422
To Juilliard. Mia, you did it.

01:37:35.280 --> 01:37:37.145
I got in.

01:37:39.600 --> 01:37:42.102
And if you want me to
come with you, I will.

01:37:43.120 --> 01:37:45.463
Okay, I'll move to New York.

01:37:45.960 --> 01:37:48.508
I'll do whatever you want.

01:37:49.160 --> 01:37:51.469
Just please stay.

01:37:52.560 --> 01:37:54.903
You're my home, Mia.

01:37:55.760 --> 01:37:56.860
I don't care where we are.

01:37:56.960 --> 01:37:59.349
I just care that we're together.

01:38:00.960 --> 01:38:03.189
I know that now.

01:38:05.400 --> 01:38:08.380
I will do anything if you stay.

01:38:09.120 --> 01:38:11.145
I can't.

01:38:11.640 --> 01:38:13.301
You know I can't.

01:38:19.640 --> 01:38:21.260
I'm still kinda working
on this thing, but...

01:38:31.320 --> 01:38:33.709
You wrote me a song.

01:38:39.200 --> 01:38:42.460
Breathe deep, breathe clear

01:38:42.560 --> 01:38:45.100
Know that I'm here

01:38:45.200 --> 01:38:48.220
Know that I'm here

01:38:48.320 --> 01:38:49.580
Waiting

01:38:49.680 --> 01:38:52.900
Stay strong, stay gold

01:38:53.000 --> 01:38:55.502
You don't have to fear

01:38:55.680 --> 01:38:58.740
You don't have to fear

01:38:58.840 --> 01:38:59.860
Waiting

01:38:59.960 --> 01:39:07.184
I'll see you soon

01:39:09.080 --> 01:39:14.100
How could a heart like yours

01:39:14.200 --> 01:39:19.420
Ever love a heart like mine?

01:39:19.520 --> 01:39:24.460
How could I live before?

01:39:24.560 --> 01:39:28.380
How could I have been so blind?

01:39:30.400 --> 01:39:32.740
So blind

01:39:32.840 --> 01:39:35.388
You opened up my heart...

01:39:37.200 --> 01:39:39.540
You still have a family.

01:39:39.640 --> 01:39:41.140
All your love

01:39:41.240 --> 01:39:43.742
Is all I'll ever need

01:39:44.400 --> 01:39:47.346
I will do anything if you stay.

01:39:48.560 --> 01:39:49.820
If you wanna go,

01:39:49.920 --> 01:39:52.468
I want you to know it's okay.

01:39:55.960 --> 01:40:00.749
How could I live before?

01:40:00.960 --> 01:40:02.871
How could I have lived?

01:40:23.760 --> 01:40:25.307
Mia.

01:40:33.760 --> 01:40:38.470
Take my mind and take my pain

01:40:41.160 --> 01:40:46.143
Like an empty bottle takes the rain

01:40:48.960 --> 01:40:54.591
And heal, heal

01:40:54.760 --> 01:40:57.388
Heal, heal

01:41:00.360 --> 01:41:05.502
Take my past and take my sins

01:41:07.920 --> 01:41:13.142
Like an empty sail takes the wind

01:41:16.000 --> 01:41:21.347
And heal, heal

01:41:21.560 --> 01:41:24.381
Heal, heal

01:41:27.440 --> 01:41:34.949
And tell me some things last

01:41:36.800 --> 01:41:44.024
And tell me some things last

01:42:01.360 --> 01:42:06.070
Take my heart and take my hand

01:42:08.280 --> 01:42:13.183
Like an ocean takes the dirty sands

01:42:15.840 --> 01:42:20.660
And heal, heal

01:42:20.760 --> 01:42:23.547
Heal, heal

01:42:25.880 --> 01:42:30.669
Take my mind and take my pain

01:42:33.000 --> 01:42:37.585
Like an empty bottle takes the rain

01:42:40.120 --> 01:42:44.860
And heal, heal

01:42:44.960 --> 01:42:47.906
Heal, heal

01:42:49.400 --> 01:42:56.351
And tell me some things last

01:42:58.160 --> 01:43:04.941
And tell me some things last

01:43:06.840 --> 01:43:13.791
And tell me some things last

01:43:15.760 --> 01:43:22.791
And tell me some things last

01:43:36.640 --> 01:43:39.825
I spend these hollow nights

01:43:40.200 --> 01:43:43.146
All alone

01:43:46.840 --> 01:43:50.060
Safe from the looking glass

01:43:50.160 --> 01:43:53.823
That you kept home

01:43:56.440 --> 01:43:58.669
Let's go

01:44:02.240 --> 01:44:05.060
I saw the sea and knew

01:44:05.160 --> 01:44:09.631
It was a mirage

01:44:12.400 --> 01:44:15.580
It wasn't even so

01:44:15.680 --> 01:44:19.423
I played the odds

01:44:23.480 --> 01:44:26.586
Full of black and blues

01:44:28.600 --> 01:44:31.260
From all the nights with you

01:44:31.360 --> 01:44:33.900
I never wanted to go

01:44:34.000 --> 01:44:36.389
I don't want you anymore

01:44:36.520 --> 01:44:41.540
I don't want you to
feel the same as me

01:44:41.640 --> 01:44:44.140
I never wanted to go

01:44:44.240 --> 01:44:46.580
But now I'm letting you know

01:44:46.680 --> 01:44:49.100
I just wanted to feel

01:44:49.200 --> 01:44:54.228
The life in me

01:44:58.360 --> 01:45:01.620
I went from solid steel

01:45:01.720 --> 01:45:05.463
To broken glass

01:45:08.600 --> 01:45:11.740
The darkest side in me

01:45:11.840 --> 01:45:15.071
You brought out fast

01:45:19.520 --> 01:45:22.990
The things I said were true

01:45:24.640 --> 01:45:27.460
I'm taking them back from you

01:45:27.560 --> 01:45:30.140
I never wanted to go

01:45:30.240 --> 01:45:32.740
I don't want you anymore

01:45:32.840 --> 01:45:37.780
I don't want you to
feel the same as me

01:45:37.880 --> 01:45:40.340
I never wanted to go

01:45:40.440 --> 01:45:42.900
But now I'm letting you know

01:45:43.000 --> 01:45:45.340
I just wanted to feel

01:45:45.440 --> 01:45:49.661
The life in me

01:45:49.920 --> 01:45:52.340
I miss you

01:45:52.440 --> 01:45:55.102
I wish you

01:45:55.720 --> 01:45:58.143
Will let me be

01:46:00.080 --> 01:46:02.340
Just leave it

01:46:02.440 --> 01:46:04.500
We stopped breathing

01:46:04.600 --> 01:46:08.070
I need to be free

01:46:08.480 --> 01:46:10.940
I never wanted to go

01:46:11.040 --> 01:46:13.380
But now I'm letting you know

01:46:13.480 --> 01:46:15.439
I just wanted to feel

01:46:15.440 --> 01:46:21.663
The life in me

01:46:22.305 --> 01:46:28.509
