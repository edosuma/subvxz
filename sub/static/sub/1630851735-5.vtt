WEBVTT

00:09.750 --> 00:10.958
Mmm! Mmm!

00:11.041 --> 00:12.291
Rockin' meatloaf, Mom.

00:12.375 --> 00:16.250
Why, Brett,
it's just the recipe I always use.

00:16.333 --> 00:18.041
Yeah, meat and loaf.

00:18.125 --> 00:19.625
-Meat and loaf.

00:21.125 --> 00:22.500
Oh, Deany.

00:22.583 --> 00:24.083
So, how's the job, son?

00:24.166 --> 00:26.208
Well, I'm not really supposed to talk
about it,

00:26.291 --> 00:28.333
but I have made some awesome friends.

00:28.416 --> 00:30.583
And I hear there's a girl.

00:30.666 --> 00:32.666
Aw, Mom, it's not like that.

00:32.750 --> 00:34.500
Reagan and I are just BFFs,

00:34.583 --> 00:36.000
business friends forever.

00:36.083 --> 00:37.291
-Brett!

00:37.375 --> 00:39.583
What kind of sick shit
are you doing in here?

00:39.666 --> 00:41.250
The holo-chamber is not a toy.

00:41.333 --> 00:44.750
It's for training simulations
and official government sex stuff.

00:44.833 --> 00:45.666
Sorry, Reagan.

00:45.750 --> 00:48.458
It's just, with work, I've missed
a lot of family dinners lately,

00:48.541 --> 00:50.125
so this lets me bond virtually.

00:50.208 --> 00:51.291
Family dinners?

00:51.375 --> 00:54.625
I thought those were a myth
made up by greeting-card companies,

00:54.708 --> 00:57.291
like Christmas or saying "I love you."

00:57.375 --> 01:00.916
It's like no one ever really connects
face-to-face, you know?

01:01.000 --> 01:04.541
Brett, Reagan, get out of the Sex-Deck.
We've got a mission.

01:04.625 --> 01:06.833
You weren't looking through
my Sex-Deck history, were you?

01:06.916 --> 01:08.125
-Good Lord, no.
-No, no, no, no.

01:08.208 --> 01:09.458
Ah, good.

01:10.041 --> 01:13.458
-Wanna look through his Sex-Deck history?
-Yeah, we got five minutes.

01:14.375 --> 01:15.708
What's a pay pig?

01:39.291 --> 01:41.416
Say hello to today's mission.

01:41.500 --> 01:44.541
Jolt Cola? Lawn darts?
Slap bracelets?

01:44.625 --> 01:47.750
-Son of a bitch!
-What kind of mission is this, J.R.?

01:47.833 --> 01:51.333
Are we assassinating
a 1980s sleepover?

01:51.416 --> 01:53.291
-Not directly.

01:53.375 --> 01:55.416
-Still Valley, Wyoming.

01:55.500 --> 01:59.291
In 1984, we tested
our first mind-erasing chemicals there.

01:59.375 --> 02:01.541
Unfortunately, they worked too well.

02:01.625 --> 02:04.458
They've been mentally stuck
in 1984 ever since,

02:04.541 --> 02:06.416
which makes it the perfect place for us

02:06.500 --> 02:10.583
to sell all of corporate America's
recalled, outdated and dangerous products.

02:10.666 --> 02:13.500
-Ow! Goddamn, these things are sharp.

02:13.583 --> 02:17.458
We're trapping a town in the '80s
to sell them recalled crap?

02:17.541 --> 02:19.541
That is radically unethical.

02:19.625 --> 02:22.333
Yes. Radically unethical!

02:23.333 --> 02:24.833
God, my eyes are killing me.

02:24.916 --> 02:27.416
Huh. Ray-Banned.

02:27.500 --> 02:30.250
Anyhoo, every few years,
we give them a fresh spritz

02:30.333 --> 02:32.625
of a chemtrail called Nostalgia Max

02:32.708 --> 02:36.833
to keep them bodaciously brain-damaged.
That's what you'll be doing this week.

02:36.916 --> 02:38.416
Here's the keys to the jet.

02:38.500 --> 02:40.166
Hey, J.R., how about on this mission

02:40.250 --> 02:43.250
we all really immerse ourselves
in the 1980s?

02:43.333 --> 02:45.208
No phones, no social media,

02:45.291 --> 02:50.541
just a group of six-way best friends
really connecting face-to-face.

02:50.625 --> 02:51.458
Ugh, come on!

02:51.541 --> 02:53.333
Sometimes
I don't like talking to people.

02:53.416 --> 02:55.291
-Fucking bullshit.
-Wait, guys.

02:55.375 --> 02:58.125
Brett's got a point,
for the first time ever.

02:58.208 --> 03:00.250
If '80s town catches us
on a modern device,

03:00.333 --> 03:01.583
it'll totally blow our cover.

03:01.666 --> 03:05.625
Then it's settled. Get ready
to have a great time in the past.

03:05.708 --> 03:08.208
Oh shit,
I should've said "blast in the past."

03:08.291 --> 03:10.500
Everyone,
pretend I said "blast in the past."

03:10.583 --> 03:12.833
All right, everyone,
hand over your devices.

03:12.916 --> 03:15.541
-No. No, no, no! Not my Instagram!

03:15.625 --> 03:17.666
You son of a bitch.
I'll fucking murder you!

03:17.750 --> 03:20.000
I know where you sleep! In the walls!

03:23.791 --> 03:27.166
Look at all this stuff, Reagan.
Doesn't it just bring you back?

03:27.250 --> 03:29.125
Koosh. Koosh. Koosh.

03:29.208 --> 03:31.708
Oh, I don't know dick
about '80s pop culture.

03:31.791 --> 03:35.125
My dad threw out the TV
to make me focus on science.

03:35.208 --> 03:37.000
Weird Science?

03:37.083 --> 03:40.291
Yeah. Wait, if that's a reference
to something, I don't get it.

03:40.375 --> 03:43.208
Aw, this stuff is making me nostalgic

03:43.291 --> 03:47.375
for a time in my life when acid-wash
wasn't just a way to get rid of a body.

03:47.458 --> 03:50.208
Come on, guys,
the '80s were a garbage decade.

03:50.291 --> 03:52.083
We only idealize the past

03:52.166 --> 03:54.750
because our brains
distort our memory of it.

03:54.833 --> 03:56.750
Hey, there is nothing wrong
with my brain--

03:56.833 --> 03:59.625
Oh my God,
I had these exact scented markers!

04:01.125 --> 04:02.125
Ooh!

04:02.208 --> 04:04.125
Take me away, cosmic berry blast.

04:04.208 --> 04:06.958
Why do you care about this stuff?
Weren't you born in the '90s?

04:07.041 --> 04:09.958
Yeah, but I always felt like
a slightly older soul.

04:10.041 --> 04:12.458
Also the '80s had the best TV show ever,

04:12.541 --> 04:15.666
The Growing Years.
That was my family's Sunday night ritual.

04:15.750 --> 04:18.458
Didn't that little brother from that show
become a drug addict?

04:18.541 --> 04:21.208
Yes. Yes, he did.

04:21.291 --> 04:22.583
But not until the '90s.

04:23.708 --> 04:26.833
At least someone
got in the spirit of this mission.

04:26.916 --> 04:28.458
How about a game of Simon?

04:28.541 --> 04:31.291
I'm not taking orders
from some disco-ass hubcap.

04:32.500 --> 04:35.583
Wait, Myc,
did you smuggle modern-day technology

04:35.666 --> 04:38.625
onto our 1980s
group-bonding/mass-hypnosis mission?

04:38.708 --> 04:42.083
Brett, I'd lie to you,
but I just don't respect you enough.

04:42.708 --> 04:44.708
Ah, sweet screen time.

04:44.791 --> 04:47.583
You're my real friends,
hate-filled strangers.

04:47.666 --> 04:49.958
Approaching Still Valley!

04:50.041 --> 04:54.458
-Chemtrails locked and loaded.
-Lowering altitude, raising attitude.

04:54.541 --> 04:57.583
Venting Nostalgia Max
in T-minus three.

04:57.666 --> 04:58.916
Guys, I wanna make a toast.

04:59.000 --> 05:00.958
To us, 'cause when we all get together…

05:01.041 --> 05:01.875
Whoa!

05:01.958 --> 05:03.250
…good things happen.

05:04.583 --> 05:07.750
It's okay. I have parachute pants.

05:08.333 --> 05:10.791
Shit, these things are fucking worthless.

05:13.416 --> 05:14.750
-Myc!
-Oh God, Myc!

05:14.833 --> 05:16.875
Fuck, we have to go down there
and get him.

05:16.958 --> 05:19.250
If he's seen, he could blow
a decades-long operation

05:19.333 --> 05:20.458
and cost us a fortune.

05:20.541 --> 05:22.916
Glenn, take us down outside of town.

05:23.000 --> 05:24.666
Leave no mushroom behind.

05:33.500 --> 05:37.625
I can feel it, guys.
This is gonna be the best summer ever.

05:37.708 --> 05:40.750
Whatever happens,
we'll always be best friends.

05:40.833 --> 05:43.250
-Oh. Jesus Christ.

05:43.333 --> 05:44.625
-Did you hear that?
-Yeah.

05:44.708 --> 05:46.750
It sounds like Ashley's mom
getting humped.

05:46.833 --> 05:49.000
-It does not.
-Guys, look.

05:49.083 --> 05:51.625
-Oh shit.
-Whoa.

05:52.208 --> 05:54.375
Ah! What the fuck? My stem!

05:54.458 --> 05:55.541
Where am I?

05:55.625 --> 05:56.791
It's… it's…

05:56.875 --> 05:58.083
An alien.

05:58.166 --> 06:01.833
I'm Kevin. This is Earth.

06:01.916 --> 06:03.458
Do you have a name?

06:03.541 --> 06:05.541
I… I don't know.

06:05.625 --> 06:10.041
All I remember
is a gigantic sense of my own self-worth.

06:10.125 --> 06:12.333
According
to my junior pocket encyclopedia,

06:12.416 --> 06:14.166
he has amnesia.

06:14.250 --> 06:17.833
Guys, we gotta take him back to my house
and help him get his memory back.

06:17.916 --> 06:20.708
Yeah. It's the code of the summer friends.

06:20.791 --> 06:22.250
Summer friends!

06:22.333 --> 06:26.041
Yeah, I like
what this asthmatic virgin has to say.

06:26.125 --> 06:30.625
-What?
-Take me to a couch!

06:34.458 --> 06:36.333
I don't get it.
He should have landed right here.

06:36.416 --> 06:37.916
Myc, you out here, buddy?

06:38.000 --> 06:40.333
-Well, I guess we tried.
-Look, bike tracks.

06:40.416 --> 06:41.833
Small bikes.

06:41.916 --> 06:45.166
Kids or possibly Vietcong.

06:45.250 --> 06:46.958
Great, we're officially government agents

06:47.041 --> 06:50.291
looking for a lost extraterrestrial
kidnapped by children.

06:50.375 --> 06:53.083
-Like that classic movie, Mac and Me.

06:53.166 --> 06:54.250
This is bad, guys.

06:54.333 --> 06:58.416
If Myc gets exposed, J.R. will make us
exterminate the whole town.

06:58.500 --> 07:01.000
No one wants that, except maybe Glenn.

07:01.083 --> 07:02.666
Just keeping our options open.

07:02.750 --> 07:04.750
We can't let a whole town
get killed on our watch.

07:04.833 --> 07:08.208
We'll get fired. Or promoted?
I can never remember how evil we are.

07:08.291 --> 07:10.958
I can't track Myc's smartwatch
without my phone.

07:11.041 --> 07:13.791
Quick, what's the most advanced
computing technology we have?

07:13.875 --> 07:16.083
-Okay, fork it over.

07:17.791 --> 07:21.958
Reagan says find Myc,
and do not let anyone see you.

07:28.958 --> 07:31.250
Goddamn it. Fucking '80s owl.

07:31.333 --> 07:33.333
Global warming will take care of you.

07:38.000 --> 07:40.083
Ah.

07:40.166 --> 07:43.541
Still Valley,
where Ronald Reagan is always president

07:43.625 --> 07:47.166
and Me Too was just the answer to,
"Who else wants to go to Bennigan's?"

07:47.250 --> 07:49.708
Okay, split the town into quadrants
and search on foot,

07:49.791 --> 07:52.083
while I try to rig a tracker
for the signal for Myc's watch.

07:54.250 --> 07:57.583
Well, some pretty gnarly driving
there, huh?

07:57.666 --> 07:59.208
What are you guys, the A-Team?

07:59.791 --> 08:01.416
-What's the A-Team?

08:01.500 --> 08:04.166
-She don't know The A-Team?
-Who wouldn't know The A-Team?

08:04.250 --> 08:08.291
Of course she knows
the most popular show on television,

08:08.375 --> 08:10.750
which we all watch together as a family,

08:10.833 --> 08:12.291
which we are.

08:12.375 --> 08:15.041
-A family, Brett?
-It's the perfect plan.

08:15.125 --> 08:18.583
We'll go undercover as an '80s family,
earn the town's trust, and locate Myc.

08:18.666 --> 08:20.958
That's convoluted and wacky.
It'll never work.

08:21.041 --> 08:23.958
Works for me.
I hope you guys like the '80s,

08:24.041 --> 08:26.541
'cause that's what
the temperature's gonna be all week.

08:30.125 --> 08:33.583
Ah, I still can't believe
we were able to buy a 1980s family home

08:33.666 --> 08:35.041
with the cash in our wallets.

08:35.125 --> 08:37.208
Why are baby boomers so mad all the time?

08:37.291 --> 08:38.208
We don't know.

08:38.291 --> 08:41.416
Look, we're just staying in this house
as a cover while we hunt for Myc.

08:41.500 --> 08:45.125
-Now, let's get this over with.
-I have undercover roles for everyone.

08:45.208 --> 08:46.833
Glenn, you'll be the dad,

08:46.916 --> 08:49.500
a gruff yet lovable teacher
at the high school.

08:49.583 --> 08:51.375
You can grill your students for info.

08:51.458 --> 08:54.583
A Guantanamo for teenagers? I love it.

08:54.666 --> 08:57.833
Gigi, you'll be
our mom/editor of the local paper.

08:57.916 --> 08:59.083
Snoop that gossip.

08:59.166 --> 09:01.666
A baby and a briefcase? I want it all.

09:01.750 --> 09:04.791
Andre, you'll be
a local Chinese restaurant owner.

09:04.875 --> 09:05.791
I'm Korean.

09:05.875 --> 09:09.250
And, Reagan, we're fraternal twins.
I'll be the boy.

09:09.333 --> 09:12.541
Fine. Let's just go investigate
wherever normal kids hang out.

09:12.625 --> 09:15.291
I wanna say welding-parts store.

09:15.375 --> 09:18.166
Oh, sweet emotionally abused Reagan.

09:18.250 --> 09:20.125
We're going to the mall.

09:20.208 --> 09:21.208
'80s wipe!

09:28.916 --> 09:31.291
-Okay, it's safe to come out now.

09:31.375 --> 09:33.541
-Ugh.

09:33.625 --> 09:35.583
I'm Kevin, kind of a regular kid.

09:35.666 --> 09:37.750
That's Charlie, a girl with a boy's name.

09:37.833 --> 09:39.500
Ashley, a boy with a girl's name.

09:39.583 --> 09:40.541
And that's Lamar.

09:40.625 --> 09:42.750
But my friends call me O.J.,
after my hero.

09:42.833 --> 09:46.750
Yeah, I can't remember why,
but I'm not gonna do that.

09:46.833 --> 09:48.916
-Do you have a name?
-I'm not sure.

09:49.000 --> 09:51.750
The last thing I can remember
is getting needled

09:51.833 --> 09:54.875
by a bunch of inferior beings.

09:54.958 --> 09:55.958
Needles?

09:56.041 --> 09:58.208
The government
must have been experimenting on him.

09:59.208 --> 10:02.500
Myc, this is your reminder
to renew your subscription to…

10:02.583 --> 10:04.666
-…MrSkin.com.

10:04.750 --> 10:06.083
Whoa!

10:06.166 --> 10:10.375
This must be a device to communicate
with his home planet of… Bukkake?

10:10.958 --> 10:13.416
Maybe some food will help him
get his memory back.

10:13.500 --> 10:15.791
-Fuck it. What the hell?

10:18.416 --> 10:21.958
Oh Jesus, what are you feeding me?
Licorice rabbit turds?

10:22.041 --> 10:24.916
You dickheads trying to poison me
or something? Fucking shit!

10:25.000 --> 10:27.000
I'm learning so many new alien words.

10:27.083 --> 10:28.708
God, I'm bored!

10:28.791 --> 10:31.125
Where'd that hot mom go?
Is dad in the picture?

10:31.208 --> 10:35.583
I'm getting a joint-custody vibe
off of you. Am I right?

10:40.333 --> 10:41.916
Oh, so this is where Cognito unloads

10:42.000 --> 10:44.416
all the hazardous products
they can't sell anymore.

10:44.500 --> 10:47.083
Introducing new Tylenol eZ Cap,

10:47.166 --> 10:50.125
with a cap so loose
even a baby could swallow it.

10:52.166 --> 10:53.541
This is the life, eh, Reag?

10:53.625 --> 10:55.666
People shopping in actual stores.

10:55.750 --> 10:58.208
And instead of smartphones,
filthy pay phones.

10:59.666 --> 11:02.500
Well, yeah, but we have
same-day delivery, Wi-Fi,

11:02.583 --> 11:05.125
and phones
that we never have to actually talk on.

11:05.208 --> 11:06.041
Where's Andre?

11:06.125 --> 11:08.250
Oh my God, that accent.

11:08.333 --> 11:11.166
I've never been with an Oriental guy.

11:11.250 --> 11:13.500
Okay, I'm trying to decide

11:13.583 --> 11:15.750
if you're hot enough
to get away with saying that.

11:15.833 --> 11:18.041
Bow. What's your name?

11:18.125 --> 11:19.041
It's Doc--

11:19.125 --> 11:20.458
Uh, I… I…

11:20.541 --> 11:23.000
I mean Duck… Duck Peking.

11:23.083 --> 11:24.125
Ah fuck!

11:24.208 --> 11:26.333
-What the hell was that?

11:26.416 --> 11:27.916
Sorry.

11:28.000 --> 11:30.458
Oh, maybe I can turn
these hoop earrings into weapons

11:30.541 --> 11:32.125
and torture information out of someone.

11:32.208 --> 11:33.958
No. We're doing this together.

11:34.041 --> 11:35.500
Dude, what is your deal?

11:35.583 --> 11:38.208
You have been super clingy
ever since we got here.

11:38.291 --> 11:41.250
Because in the '80s everyone has a clique.

11:41.333 --> 11:43.166
Nerds, jocks…

11:45.083 --> 11:47.583
…evil mayors
who wanna tear down the rec center.

11:48.125 --> 11:49.750
Hey, we need our own group name.

11:49.833 --> 11:51.416
How about the Brett Pack?

11:51.500 --> 11:52.916
When would we even use that?

11:53.000 --> 11:54.333
Brett Pack never says die.

11:55.833 --> 11:59.833
All right, I'm your new history teacher,
Mr. Dolphman.

11:59.916 --> 12:01.500
O Captain, my Captain!

12:01.583 --> 12:02.750
Knock it off!

12:02.833 --> 12:04.166
All right, jibber-jabber,

12:04.250 --> 12:08.416
which one of you delinquents
is secretly harboring a talking mushroom?

12:08.500 --> 12:10.833
We're not answering
any questions from adults,

12:10.916 --> 12:13.791
not until this town
lifts the ban on dancing.

12:13.875 --> 12:18.083
Eh, not sure how or why
an entire town could ban dancing,

12:18.166 --> 12:20.083
but I don't like your attitude!

12:20.166 --> 12:22.375
Eat my shorts.

12:22.458 --> 12:25.041
-You gunning for detention?

12:25.125 --> 12:28.916
Mr. Dolphman,
are you physically striking a student?

12:29.000 --> 12:30.958
Uh, well, uh…

12:31.041 --> 12:32.166
Let me give you my belt.

12:32.250 --> 12:35.708
Beating lessons into kids
is very socially acceptable these days.

12:35.791 --> 12:38.125
God bless this decade!

12:39.166 --> 12:42.291
All right, you ink-stained desk jockeys,
let's break some news.

12:47.208 --> 12:49.708
-I said wake the hell up!

12:49.791 --> 12:51.083
We've got a missing persons case,

12:51.166 --> 12:53.750
and it's the biggest thing
to ever happen in this sleepy-ass town.

12:53.833 --> 12:56.500
I don't know,
we had a big story last year.

12:57.333 --> 12:59.750
The hell?
Are you kidding me with this crap?

12:59.833 --> 13:01.958
Don't worry, boss.
It'll run first thing Sunday

13:02.041 --> 13:03.416
if there aren't too many coupons.

13:03.500 --> 13:06.166
-Oh yeah, coupons are a big thing.
-Everyone uses coupons.

13:06.250 --> 13:09.708
How could '80s news be so slow?
I thought you were all on cocaine.

13:09.791 --> 13:11.166
On a reporter's salary?

13:11.250 --> 13:14.000
Uh, not unless there's
some cheap, new, smokable version

13:14.083 --> 13:15.291
we don't know about yet.

13:16.666 --> 13:17.500
Hook me up.

13:17.583 --> 13:18.625
Listen, where I'm from,

13:18.708 --> 13:21.625
the news is inflammatory opinions
that even the reporters don't believe.

13:21.708 --> 13:23.208
Grab your laptops. Write this down.

13:23.291 --> 13:25.791
Opinion one. Blind people
shouldn't be allowed to have dogs.

13:25.875 --> 13:29.000
Opinion two. Only blind people
should be allowed to have dogs.

13:29.083 --> 13:31.333
Are you getting this down?
'Cause Gigi is on a roll, baby.

13:34.250 --> 13:36.541
So how was everyone's day?

13:36.625 --> 13:37.958
Exhausting.

13:38.041 --> 13:40.291
I had to make up
a whole 24-hour news cycle

13:40.375 --> 13:41.333
out of thin air.

13:41.416 --> 13:43.708
I had to jam their info
with so much 'tainment.

13:43.791 --> 13:45.708
I had to stay three hours late

13:45.791 --> 13:48.083
to supervise the brats
I sent to detention,

13:48.166 --> 13:50.375
but then they kept coming of age!

13:50.458 --> 13:53.000
Come on, it's not all bad. Right, Andre?

13:53.083 --> 13:56.541
This town is racist as hell.
Everyone keeps bowing at me.

13:56.625 --> 13:58.541
A kid challenged me to a karate fight,

13:58.625 --> 14:01.250
and every time I say anything,
somebody rings a gong.

14:03.500 --> 14:05.250
Who are you?!

14:05.333 --> 14:06.666
You know what I'm hearing?

14:06.750 --> 14:08.166
A lot of feelings.

14:08.250 --> 14:11.083
And we never open up like this
at work. Right, Reagan?

14:11.166 --> 14:12.625
-Huh?

14:12.708 --> 14:15.250
Booyah. While the rest of you guys
were playing house,

14:15.333 --> 14:18.041
I MacGyvered together a homing device.

14:18.625 --> 14:19.833
Just like the TV show.

14:19.916 --> 14:21.416
-What TV show?

14:21.500 --> 14:22.625
Lock on Myc!

14:22.708 --> 14:25.541
Let's go grab him and get the fuck
out of this one-decade town.

14:25.625 --> 14:28.500
No, we were supposed to watch
Growing Years as a family.

14:28.583 --> 14:30.125
The season premiere's on tonight.

14:30.208 --> 14:33.708
Brett, it aired 40 years ago.
When we get home, you can stream it.

14:33.791 --> 14:35.833
You can't stream me back to my childhood!

14:35.916 --> 14:38.958
-Okay, I see what's going on.

14:39.041 --> 14:40.791
This wasn't a plan to find Myc.

14:40.875 --> 14:44.375
It was your weird plan
to spend more time in fantasyland.

14:44.458 --> 14:46.583
It's just everything
is so much better here.

14:46.666 --> 14:48.416
Listen, Brett,
someone has to tell you this.

14:48.500 --> 14:50.208
-Nostalgia is bullshit.

14:50.291 --> 14:53.083
It is a brain-worm
that makes adults regress into children

14:53.166 --> 14:56.708
who argue about Ghostbusters
while the world fucking burns.

14:56.791 --> 14:59.416
Hey, don't say things
about Ghostbusters you can't take back.

14:59.500 --> 15:00.875
-Ghostbusters…
-Don't.

15:00.958 --> 15:02.625
-…is fucking…
-Don't you dare.

15:02.708 --> 15:04.708
-…stupid.

15:04.791 --> 15:07.041
You never enjoyed anything as a kid,

15:07.125 --> 15:09.750
so you can't understand
how much this stuff means to me.

15:09.833 --> 15:12.000
Brett, you can stay here
in the past if you want,

15:12.083 --> 15:14.083
but we're gonna find Myc
with or without you.

15:14.166 --> 15:16.250
I can't believe
we came out of the same womb!

15:16.333 --> 15:17.958
-We didn't.

15:18.041 --> 15:20.791
Mmm, mmm, mmm.
I thought I raised you better than this.

15:21.875 --> 15:25.000
And that's how you smoke
and drink at the same time.

15:25.083 --> 15:28.416
-Is your memory back yet?
-Almost, yeah. Uh.

15:28.500 --> 15:30.250
Why don't you grab
another Bartles & Jaymes

15:30.333 --> 15:31.583
and see if that does the trick?

15:31.666 --> 15:33.875
Oh, and tell whoever decorated this room

15:33.958 --> 15:37.000
that it looks like a TGI fucking Fridays.

15:37.083 --> 15:39.916
Kevin, I don't think Myc is actually nice.

15:40.000 --> 15:43.708
He keeps eating all your Zoobooks
and punching holes in the walls.

15:43.791 --> 15:45.208
I don't think he's punching.

15:45.291 --> 15:47.833
Ooh.

15:47.916 --> 15:51.375
And I don't wanna make a big thing of it,
but he called me Leroy twice

15:51.458 --> 15:52.458
and Tyrone once.

15:52.541 --> 15:55.166
I don't know, guys.
What if the government finds him?

15:55.250 --> 15:57.416
Maybe President Reagan
will give us a medal.

15:57.500 --> 15:58.791
Reagan.

15:58.875 --> 16:02.625
Reagan? Why does that name
annoy the crap out of me?

16:03.375 --> 16:05.000
Nah, lost it.

16:05.083 --> 16:09.041
Main kid, go get your hot mom's car keys.
We're going to the liquor store.

16:09.125 --> 16:11.458
No. All you've done
is take advantage of us.

16:11.541 --> 16:13.666
According
to my junior pocket encyclopedia,

16:13.750 --> 16:14.625
you're a dick.

16:14.708 --> 16:17.375
Fine, I was leaving anyway.

16:17.458 --> 16:20.916
Put me back in your bike basket
and bring me back where you found me.

16:22.125 --> 16:24.458
-Well?
-You can walk to the bikes.

16:25.750 --> 16:28.666
Oh, your Earth atmosphere,
it's like poison.

16:28.750 --> 16:30.083
Carry me!

16:31.833 --> 16:33.208
Yeah, that's right.

16:33.291 --> 16:35.000
Carry me, you swine.

16:42.416 --> 16:44.333
Okay, Brett, it's no big deal.

16:44.416 --> 16:46.875
You just wanna stay here
a little longer with your friends.

16:46.958 --> 16:49.041
Just a couple spritzes of Nostalgia Max,

16:49.708 --> 16:52.875
and they will love it here
as much as you do.

16:52.958 --> 16:53.958
Oh no. No, no.

16:54.041 --> 16:55.291
Fuck!

16:58.750 --> 17:01.708
Okay,
a full tank of Nostalgia Max

17:01.791 --> 17:05.166
mixed with banned '80s products
full of dangerous chemicals.

17:05.250 --> 17:07.166
What could go wrong?

17:11.000 --> 17:12.583
Did I do that?

17:13.083 --> 17:15.666
Yes! Yes, I did!

17:17.083 --> 17:19.000
-Okay, this is it.

17:19.083 --> 17:21.250
Vietcong stronghold.

17:23.916 --> 17:26.166
Damn it. This was Myc's last location.

17:26.250 --> 17:27.666
He must have left tracks.

17:27.750 --> 17:29.958
Man, maybe I was too harsh on Brett.

17:30.041 --> 17:32.166
I just don't get why he's so obsessed
with this decade.

17:32.250 --> 17:34.166
He is clearly going through something.

17:34.250 --> 17:37.708
He said he wanted to be
streamed back to his childhood.

17:37.791 --> 17:41.125
I've known POWs
with a better grip on reality.

17:41.208 --> 17:44.166
I thought it was another one
of his weird '80s references.

17:44.250 --> 17:47.083
-I mean, what the hell is a Koosh ball?
-How would you know?

17:47.166 --> 17:49.000
You've never watched
anything from the '80s.

17:49.083 --> 17:52.250
And it's not about what a Koosh is.
It's what a Koosh means.

17:52.333 --> 17:53.375
How do I make it up to him?

17:53.458 --> 17:54.875
Like most white dudes,

17:54.958 --> 17:57.666
the only way to bond with Brett
is to watch '80s movies

17:57.750 --> 18:00.458
then quote them
instead of thinking of jokes yourself.

18:00.541 --> 18:02.291
-Go. We'll keep looking.

18:02.375 --> 18:05.750
And if I see one goddamn rewind fee…

18:05.833 --> 18:08.708
-Thanks, Glenn.
-They grow up so fast.

18:09.916 --> 18:11.666
Good evening, ma'am.
It's Super Saver Night.

18:11.750 --> 18:13.416
-What do you want to see?
-Everything.

18:13.500 --> 18:15.458
I wanna super save my friendship.

18:16.625 --> 18:18.625
Listen, I don't need to know
your whole deal.

18:30.458 --> 18:33.416
Okay, I memorized
your whole must-see list,

18:33.500 --> 18:36.958
but I still don't get why Brett
is so wrapped up in this stuff.

18:38.208 --> 18:41.291
-I'm sorry I went in your room, Mitch.

18:41.375 --> 18:43.750
I just wanted to be like my big brother.

18:43.833 --> 18:45.625
You're my hero, Mitch.

18:45.708 --> 18:47.083
Aw!

18:47.166 --> 18:49.708
The hell? That family looks just like--

18:49.791 --> 18:53.166
The Weavers. The heartwarming family
from TV's The Growing Years.

18:53.250 --> 18:55.000
Yeah, meat and loaf.

18:55.083 --> 18:58.625
Oh my God. That family in the hologram
wasn't his family.

18:58.708 --> 19:01.041
It was this '80s sitcom family.

19:01.125 --> 19:02.833
I'm not sure who we're talking about.

19:02.916 --> 19:04.500
Yeah, welcome to my fucking world.

19:08.416 --> 19:10.833
Don't you forget about me.

19:10.916 --> 19:13.166
Where is my Brett Pack?

19:14.208 --> 19:15.250
Faster.

19:15.333 --> 19:18.416
I thought you kids were hopped up
on milk hormones and grape juice.

19:18.500 --> 19:20.666
I'm pedaling as fast as I can.

19:20.750 --> 19:23.500
Seriously?
No wonder your dad left.

19:23.583 --> 19:25.041
-That's it!

19:25.125 --> 19:26.791
-Fuck you, Myc!

19:26.875 --> 19:30.416
-Shit!

19:30.500 --> 19:32.500
You ruined the magic of childhood.

19:32.583 --> 19:35.541
I hope you get mutilated
by the government, asshole!

19:35.625 --> 19:38.750
Oh, the signal's back.
It's coming toward us really quickly.

19:38.833 --> 19:40.875
It's like he's right on top of us.

19:43.750 --> 19:44.875
Found him.

19:44.958 --> 19:47.000
I remember everything.

19:47.083 --> 19:48.666
It's you guys.

19:48.750 --> 19:50.625
I hate you guys.

19:50.708 --> 19:52.208
Wait, there's one missing.

19:52.291 --> 19:54.000
-Oh my God. Brett!

19:54.083 --> 19:55.416
Yeah, Brett.

19:55.500 --> 19:58.500
That big, dumb pussy
with all the Mormon energy.

19:59.458 --> 20:01.666
He's floating right behind me, isn't he?

20:01.750 --> 20:02.958
Oh my God! Oh shit!

20:03.041 --> 20:05.416
I am
the mighty Nostalgia Max!

20:05.500 --> 20:08.708
Bow before my totally tubular power!

20:08.791 --> 20:11.500
-It's the chemtrails!
-He must have gotten an overdose.

20:11.583 --> 20:14.291
He's turned
into some kind of nostalgia monster!

20:14.375 --> 20:16.916
I'm Lester Majors live in Town Square.

20:17.000 --> 20:17.833
-Ow!

20:17.916 --> 20:20.083
Oh no, you don't, Lester.
This is my scoop.

20:20.166 --> 20:24.000
Pandemonium tonight as some kind
of nostalgia monster attacks Town Square.

20:24.083 --> 20:26.000
Are your children going to die?

20:26.083 --> 20:28.291
If you change that channel,
they just might.

20:28.375 --> 20:31.333
Brett, float down here right this second.

20:31.416 --> 20:33.916
Wha'choo talkin' 'bout, Glennis?

20:35.375 --> 20:37.625
Where's the beef?
Where's the beef?

20:37.708 --> 20:39.500
-Where's the beef?
-Don't let him spray you.

20:39.583 --> 20:42.250
You'll become a stunted man-child
like Chris Hardwick!

20:42.333 --> 20:45.833
-Oh God.
-We're staying in the '80s forever!

20:45.916 --> 20:48.000
It will be radical!

20:51.791 --> 20:54.500
Say hello to my little friends.

20:54.583 --> 20:56.166
-Don't let them leave.

20:56.791 --> 20:58.625
-Holy shit!

20:58.708 --> 21:00.708
-The cow says die!

21:00.791 --> 21:02.333
Pull me up, pull me up!

21:02.416 --> 21:05.166
Oh God!
It's Ready Player One all over again!

21:09.416 --> 21:12.458
Brett, what's with
your whole Firestarter, Slimer vibe?

21:12.541 --> 21:14.041
It's a little derivative.

21:14.125 --> 21:16.291
How much time
did you spend at Blockbuster?

21:16.375 --> 21:17.708
Enough to make this.

21:33.916 --> 21:36.125
I didn't know violence could end badly.

21:36.208 --> 21:37.833
Tragic, dead at 40.

21:37.916 --> 21:39.083
Hey, fuck you.

21:44.166 --> 21:47.833
Brett, listen.
I know why you're doing this.

21:47.916 --> 21:49.166
I get it now.

21:49.250 --> 21:51.291
All this junk was important to you

21:51.375 --> 21:55.916
because you were using a fake family
to make up for your crappy one.

21:56.000 --> 21:57.083
Am I right?

21:57.166 --> 22:00.208
I… I…

22:00.791 --> 22:04.250
Fight it, Brett.
Think of your real family.

22:06.541 --> 22:09.041
Family photo. Everybody crowd in, come on.

22:12.833 --> 22:15.125
My kids, they're champions.

22:15.208 --> 22:17.625
-Except for Brett.
-Which one's Brett?

22:19.750 --> 22:22.166
Master Brett, your parents called.

22:22.250 --> 22:25.958
They'll be extending their trip
to Barbados one more week.

22:26.041 --> 22:28.041
But tomorrow's my birthday.

22:28.125 --> 22:29.291
Indeed.

22:30.208 --> 22:31.291
Are my brothers coming?

22:31.375 --> 22:35.916
They send their best from military school
and rehab, respectively.

22:36.000 --> 22:37.625
Will there be anything else?

22:37.708 --> 22:39.166
No, I'm okay.

22:39.250 --> 22:40.708
You're my hero, Mitch.

22:40.791 --> 22:42.625
Aw!

22:46.208 --> 22:48.375
I just want…

22:48.875 --> 22:51.041
Wanted a… a loving family.

22:51.125 --> 22:54.208
Hey, I get it, man.
My family was dogshit too.

22:54.791 --> 22:58.916
But you don't need a fake family
when you've got real BFFs.

22:59.000 --> 23:01.791
-My BFFs?

23:01.875 --> 23:03.958
We're your business family forever.

23:10.333 --> 23:12.625
-Yeah, all right!

23:13.875 --> 23:16.333
This just in,
all the white people are hugging.

23:16.416 --> 23:18.250
It really is the fucking '80s.

23:18.833 --> 23:21.500
Whoa, I really got hit hard
with nostalgia.

23:21.583 --> 23:22.708
I'm so sorry, guys.

23:22.791 --> 23:25.791
I guess I got carried away
by this fake '80s town.

23:25.875 --> 23:28.291
But I'm ready
to go back to the 2020s.

23:28.375 --> 23:30.666
Wait a minute. Fake '80s town?

23:30.750 --> 23:33.500
-And what did you mean by 2020s?

23:33.583 --> 23:35.291
Are you from the future?

23:35.375 --> 23:37.750
Uh, yes, let's go with that.

23:37.833 --> 23:42.083
-We'll see you guys in 30-something years.
-Wait, can we use your time machine?

23:42.166 --> 23:47.208
We want to go back
to the one perfect decade, the 1950s.

23:47.291 --> 23:50.041
-Huh. I guess everybody's nostalgic

23:50.125 --> 23:52.208
for a simpler time
that never really existed.

23:52.291 --> 23:56.458
And the word "Chinese"
just meant "generally Asian."

23:56.541 --> 23:58.166
I really fucking hate this town.

23:58.250 --> 24:00.291
-Goddamn it!

24:02.166 --> 24:03.333
Oh hey, virgins.

24:03.416 --> 24:05.916
Kevin, Charlie, fat kid, Tyrone.

24:06.000 --> 24:06.833
Man, come on.

24:06.916 --> 24:09.083
I guess you'll be going back
to your home planet.

24:09.166 --> 24:11.500
It's actually
a brownstone in Alexandria.

24:11.583 --> 24:12.750
But don't worry, Kevin.

24:12.833 --> 24:17.666
-I'll be right here.

24:17.750 --> 24:20.375
That's for throwing me off a cliff,
you little bastard.

24:20.458 --> 24:22.333
You know, Brett,
you weren't totally wrong.

24:22.416 --> 24:25.416
This decade did bring us
accidentally closer together.

24:25.500 --> 24:27.666
Hey, I've got an idea
for when we get back.

24:29.250 --> 24:32.208
-Family dinner. What are we watching?
-Boom.

24:32.291 --> 24:35.041
Can you believe Goonies was only 6.99?

24:35.125 --> 24:36.375
Thoroughly, yes.

24:36.458 --> 24:38.125
Ah.

24:38.208 --> 24:40.250
-Everything you remember?

24:40.333 --> 24:41.375
Even better.

24:43.750 --> 24:47.625
So is their disabled brother
just straight up chained to a wall?

24:47.708 --> 24:49.541
Huh. Wow, yeah, that's…

24:49.625 --> 24:51.291
That hits different today.
