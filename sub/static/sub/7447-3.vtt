WEBVTT

00:01.080 --> 00:04.448
I'm the man who's gonna take down
Kate Leigh and Tilly Devine

00:04.600 --> 00:05.931
and you're gonna help me.

00:06.080 --> 00:09.050
Nobody pushes me around.

00:09.200 --> 00:11.771
I haven't even started to push yet.

00:11.920 --> 00:14.924
We got rid of your mate
Squizzy Taylor,

00:15.080 --> 00:16.809
and we can get rid of you.

00:16.960 --> 00:20.487
Judge says Kate Leigh must be
the worst woman in Sydney.

00:20.640 --> 00:21.971
No mention of Tilly Devine.

00:22.120 --> 00:24.407
You're a gangster, aren't you?
Say you are.

00:24.560 --> 00:26.369
Gives you a thrill, does it?

00:26.520 --> 00:28.568
I've never met anyone like you.

00:28.720 --> 00:32.281
I know from our contacts
down south you're a serious fella.

00:32.439 --> 00:34.727
I thought maybe we can do some good
for each other.

00:34.880 --> 00:38.282
You see, I don't think I need
a fancy man like you, Phil.

00:38.440 --> 00:41.444
Sorry, Mr Bruhn. Bloody heck.

00:41.600 --> 00:43.090
I'd sooner out me own heart out.

00:43.240 --> 00:46.164
You ever had a razor cut?
The bleeding never stops.

00:46.320 --> 00:49.164
With these things,
one stroke light as a feather,

00:49.320 --> 00:51.084
you can open a man's face
to the bone.

00:51.240 --> 00:52.571
Walk in the light - be visible.

00:52.720 --> 00:54.051
You're sending a message -

00:54.200 --> 00:55.964
Darlinghurst
is not a lawless town, right?

00:56.120 --> 00:57.360
Off you go.

00:57.520 --> 00:59.761
Be careful, won't you?
Yeah, yeah.

00:59.920 --> 01:01.763
They wouldn't know what to do
without you.

01:06.400 --> 01:08.482
George Wallace?!
G'day, Sid.

01:09.680 --> 01:11.045
You want a donnybrook?

01:11.200 --> 01:13.851
That's not exactly
what we had in mind.

01:15.000 --> 01:21.074

02:29.600 --> 02:32.410
Norman Bruhn had launched
his grand plan

02:32.560 --> 02:35.643
to drive Tilly and Kate
out of business.

02:35.800 --> 02:38.121
He'd attacked the toughest man
in Sydney,

02:38.280 --> 02:41.250
leaving a calling card
that was violent and bloody

02:41.400 --> 02:43.243
and impossible to ignore.

02:44.880 --> 02:48.282
Oi! Don't give for free
nothing you could charge for!

02:48.440 --> 02:50.647
Don't flash your bloomers neither!

02:52.280 --> 02:54.044
Hello, Kelly.

02:54.200 --> 02:55.770
Coming in to spend your dosh?

02:55.920 --> 02:57.410
Where's your brother?

02:58.600 --> 03:00.090
He ain't here?

03:08.680 --> 03:14.403
We praised that clam open
good and proper.

03:14.560 --> 03:16.403
If Jack had pressed
just that bit harder,

03:16.560 --> 03:18.403
there'd be one less Kelly
thieving oxygen.

03:18.560 --> 03:20.528
Pressed as hard
as I wanted him to.

03:20.680 --> 03:23.251
But won't he come after you -
Kicker Kelly?

03:23.400 --> 03:25.323
Very bloody disappointed
if the coot don't oblige

03:25.480 --> 03:26.811
with a bit of payback.

03:26.960 --> 03:30.442
And when Kelly or his brother
or their mates have a go,

03:30.600 --> 03:33.922
I'll cut them up and send them
back out again as me messengers.

03:34.080 --> 03:36.651
And if they want to have another go,
I'll cut them again.

03:36.800 --> 03:38.165
Yeah!

03:38.320 --> 03:41.483
If they're thick enough to have another
go, I'll cut them again.

03:41.640 --> 03:43.847
Any of them. I'll cut them.

03:44.000 --> 03:47.322
And I'll keep on cutting
until Kate Leigh, Tilly Devine,

03:47.480 --> 03:50.165
Phil 'The Jew' Jeffs,
the whole bang lot of them

03:50.320 --> 03:51.651
get me message.

04:27.160 --> 04:29.845
Irene, goodnight.

04:30.840 --> 04:32.444
Noel wiggled that loose tooth out.

04:32.600 --> 04:34.250
Long last.

04:34.400 --> 04:35.925
Think you can find him
a ha'penny?

04:36.080 --> 04:38.048
You know I'm the tooth fairy.

04:58.760 --> 05:00.364
What are you doing?

05:01.360 --> 05:02.964
You lost a button.

05:03.120 --> 05:04.451
I can match it.

05:22.120 --> 05:23.690
So, who was it, Sid?

05:26.080 --> 05:27.764
Couldn't say.

05:28.760 --> 05:31.366
Tall? Short? Fair? Dark?

05:32.800 --> 05:34.564
Couldn't say.

05:36.040 --> 05:37.405
Razor.

05:37.560 --> 05:39.050
Unusual weapon.

05:42.160 --> 05:44.925
Gave the forks to this barber once.

05:45.080 --> 05:46.525
Maybe he's getting square.

05:46.680 --> 05:49.047
Enough, Kelly.

05:49.200 --> 05:51.362
Tilly Devine and Kate Leigh
have been rowing for years.

05:51.520 --> 05:53.807
No-one's ever taken a cutthroat
to a man before.

05:55.160 --> 05:57.367
Or have you just stood over
one drunk too many?

05:58.480 --> 06:00.164
I'm not being a copper for you.

06:00.320 --> 06:02.004
I'm not saying a thing.

06:13.320 --> 06:15.049
Mum.

06:15.200 --> 06:16.804
Mum, the kettle's boiling.

06:19.560 --> 06:21.210
Irene.

06:22.840 --> 06:24.444
You'll have the range out.

06:40.360 --> 06:41.850
Eat up, boys.

06:47.240 --> 06:48.730
Keith...

06:49.720 --> 06:51.210
...eat your breakfast.

06:54.880 --> 06:57.326
The assault certainly
made the victim's blood flow.

06:57.480 --> 07:00.211
His attacker's weapon
was not a pistol or cosh,

07:00.360 --> 07:01.964
so this correspondent was told,

07:02.120 --> 07:03.770
an ordinary folding razor.

07:03.920 --> 07:05.251
Ooh, a razor.

07:05.400 --> 07:07.289
It's a good idea.
You should carry one, Jim.

07:07.440 --> 07:08.771
You too, Frank.

07:08.920 --> 07:10.604
I'm a gunman, Tilly,
not a razor man.

07:10.760 --> 07:13.331
You don't get six months in
Long Bay jail for carrying a razor.

07:13.480 --> 07:15.244
Slashing Kicker Kelly.

07:15.400 --> 07:17.721
This cove Norman Bruhn
ought to have his wits about him.

07:17.880 --> 07:19.450
He puts his filthy mitts
on our business,

07:19.600 --> 07:22.763
I'll bloody take to him
with a bloody razor of me own.

07:22.920 --> 07:25.810
Alright, girls, clean drawers time!

07:32.680 --> 07:35.126
Hey, careful, now,
you'll put an eye out.

07:36.520 --> 07:38.887
Hey, ain't them the boys
who slashed Kelly?

07:56.040 --> 07:57.963
Get your hand off it, sonny.

08:06.160 --> 08:07.650
Shut your eyes.

08:09.000 --> 08:10.525
Put out your hand.

08:16.640 --> 08:18.324
Shrapnel.

08:19.600 --> 08:21.489
Present from Poziéres.

08:21.640 --> 08:24.450
Medic dug it out and I kept it.

08:25.920 --> 08:27.524
Good luck charm.

08:36.520 --> 08:38.522
Don't look at that bloke again.

08:58.800 --> 09:00.290
Fallen comrades.

09:00.440 --> 09:01.930
Lest we forget.

09:11.160 --> 09:12.924
Start something round here...

09:13.960 --> 09:15.291
gotta finish it.

09:15.440 --> 09:16.930
Melbourne.

09:18.240 --> 09:19.730
No weapons.

09:23.400 --> 09:24.811
Go ahead.

09:24.960 --> 09:26.769
See how far you get.

09:48.560 --> 09:52.201
Like everyone else, Norman Bruhn
had been expecting reprisals.

09:52.360 --> 09:54.124
They were part of his plan.

09:54.280 --> 09:56.965
But he'd imagined a dark alley
and a razor in his hand.

09:57.120 --> 09:58.531
He'd imagined winning.

09:58.680 --> 10:02.082
Imagined scaring Kate and Tilly
even further

10:02.240 --> 10:05.369
What he got
was a classic Sydney packarding,

10:05.520 --> 10:09.047
after Packard, the make of boot
the gangsters favoured.

10:09.200 --> 10:12.329
The assault was witnessed by
a dozen sly imbibers

10:12.480 --> 10:14.448
yet police say none could,
or would,

10:14.600 --> 10:16.125
identify the men responsible. â

10:16.280 --> 10:19.045
The chief victim, Mr Norman Bruhn,

10:19.200 --> 10:23.285
is the reputed leader of the worst gang
of thugs on the street.

10:24.280 --> 10:27.443
But Mrs Kate Leigh,
a person who's sometimes described

10:27.600 --> 10:28.965
as the Queen of the Underworld,

10:29.120 --> 10:30.451
told this correspondent

10:30.600 --> 10:32.489
that though she had heard
Mr Bruhn's name in passing,

10:32.640 --> 10:35.803
she thought him of no consequence. â

10:35.960 --> 10:37.166
So...

10:38.160 --> 10:39.571
Norm.

10:41.560 --> 10:43.050
Clear off.

10:50.040 --> 10:51.724
All of you.

11:04.240 --> 11:05.730
Missus

11:16.520 --> 11:19.410
Baby Ray has a dog.

11:19.560 --> 11:21.403
The dog is lit...

11:21.560 --> 11:22.641
.. lit... 

11:22.800 --> 11:24.165
Little.

11:24.320 --> 11:25.845
The dog is little.

11:27.080 --> 11:28.969
Keep practicing, Keithy.

11:29.120 --> 11:32.044
Show up all them posh kids, eh?

11:32.200 --> 11:36.842
Baby Ray has a dog.
The dog is little. â

11:37.840 --> 11:39.171
Norm.

11:39.320 --> 11:41.243
Maybe...

11:41.400 --> 11:43.084
you should get out
of this business you're in...

11:43.240 --> 11:44.810
Don't start.

11:44.960 --> 11:48.931
I'm lying here and you're having a go
at how I bring in a bloody earn.

11:49.080 --> 11:51.208
Language, love.

11:51.360 --> 11:53.442
You've got enough to eat, don't you?

11:53.600 --> 11:56.206
Boys aren't in bloody rags, are they?

12:08.560 --> 12:13.043
Everything I do is for you
and the boys.

12:15.240 --> 12:17.971
I came up here to get us
a better life

12:18.120 --> 12:20.282
and that's what I'm gonna do.

12:25.200 --> 12:28.329
A wise man would have given up
and gone back to Melbourne.

12:28.480 --> 12:31.643
But for Norman Bruhn,
there was no going back.

12:41.480 --> 12:42.891
On the contrary,

12:43.040 --> 12:44.644
he went on and on,

12:44.800 --> 12:48.122
pushing harder and closer
to Tilly and Kate.

13:09.960 --> 13:12.440
His strategy was simple.

13:12.600 --> 13:14.762
He was going to panic them
into leaving,

13:14.920 --> 13:16.365
scare them into yielding.

13:16.520 --> 13:18.045
After all,

13:18.200 --> 13:20.362
they were only a couple of women.

13:20.520 --> 13:23.763
How much calculated terror
could they take?

13:23.920 --> 13:26.764
I He's got me in the palm of his hand

13:43.040 --> 13:45.202
The third target
of Norman's standover campaign

13:45.360 --> 13:47.931
was Phil Jeffs
and his two-up schools.

13:48.080 --> 13:51.004
They were a handy
and inexhaustible little earner:

14:34.080 --> 14:36.481
You, get him to St Vincent's.

14:42.040 --> 14:43.849
In those heady bygone days,

14:44.000 --> 14:46.401
a weapon of terror
cost just a few pence.

14:46.560 --> 14:51.487
Suddenly, every street hood
and standover wannabe in the city

14:51.640 --> 14:55.247
was carrying a Bengal blade
and using it.

14:55.400 --> 14:59.086
Norman Bruhn had ushered in the era
of the razor gangs.

14:59.240 --> 15:02.130
More razor attacks!
Streets are running red!

15:02.280 --> 15:03.611
Read it in 'Truth'!

15:03.760 --> 15:06.684
More razor attacks!
Streets are running red!

15:17.800 --> 15:19.245
As for the police,

15:19.400 --> 15:21.926
well, Blind Freddy could see
there was a war on.

15:22.080 --> 15:25.368
But figuring out the whos, whys
and wherefores,

15:25.520 --> 15:30.082
well, that required someone
actually opening their mouth.

15:30.240 --> 15:32.242
So, whose blood's that, then?

15:34.120 --> 15:35.610
That yours, Ernest Wilson?

15:40.840 --> 15:42.729
Not yours, I hope, Mr Jeffs.

15:42.880 --> 15:44.848
No, it's not blood, Inspector.

15:45.000 --> 15:47.685
My clumsy associate here,
he spilled a pot of paint.

15:49.480 --> 15:51.005
What the fuck's going on?

15:51.160 --> 15:52.650
Nothing.

15:53.800 --> 15:55.768
What the fuck is going on?

15:55.920 --> 15:58.127
Nothin'.

15:58.280 --> 15:59.770
Do you kiss your mother
with that mouth?

15:59.920 --> 16:01.490
You're a sensible woman, Kate.

16:03.040 --> 16:04.644
Something nasty's brewing.

16:05.640 --> 16:07.290
Besides your watered-down whisky.

16:07.440 --> 16:09.681
I don't water me whisky.

16:09.840 --> 16:11.842
Well, whatever this is,
it's getting out of hand.

16:12.000 --> 16:13.411
Is it Jeffs?

16:13.560 --> 16:15.767
The Devines?
Are you and Tilly feuding again?

16:17.360 --> 16:19.044
Or have you ladies pitched in together,

16:19.200 --> 16:22.090
decided you'll slash your way through
the competition?

16:26.640 --> 16:28.961
Bill, I know that you've got
a job to do,

16:29.120 --> 16:31.282
but there's three things
that you need to know.

16:32.320 --> 16:33.810
One,

16:33.960 --> 16:35.689
I don't water me whisky.

16:35.840 --> 16:37.046
Two,

16:37.200 --> 16:38.770
I've always looked after me own.

16:38.920 --> 16:40.251
And three,

16:40.400 --> 16:42.482
I could boot Tilly Devine
a bigger distance

16:42.640 --> 16:44.324
than I'd trust her
to pitch in with anyone.

16:44.480 --> 16:48.201
Don't understand why you'd think
of me and her in the same breath.

16:48.360 --> 16:50.328
Selling illicit liquor,

16:50.480 --> 16:51.811
peddling dope,

16:51.960 --> 16:53.325
ruining young girls' lives.

16:54.680 --> 16:58.162
No-one can say I've done terrible
things like Kate Leigh.

17:01.160 --> 17:05.050
Er... Mrs Devine,
I'm trying to help you here.

17:05.200 --> 17:08.249
Jeffs, you, Kate Leigh,

17:08.400 --> 17:12.165
someone's targeting you 'cause you all
trade in the same general area.

17:13.240 --> 17:16.722
Listen, 'Mackie', I wouldn't let me dog
shit in the same fucking area

17:16.880 --> 17:18.290
as Kate fucking Leigh.

17:18.440 --> 17:20.965
Now, fuck off out of me house.
I got shit to do.

17:21.119 --> 17:22.804
Go on!

17:29.520 --> 17:31.010
Turn around.

17:32.120 --> 17:33.929
Turn around.
Can I've a go next, Dad?

17:34.080 --> 17:36.208
Course you can. Keep pedaling.

17:37.200 --> 17:38.486
Keep pedaling.

17:38.640 --> 17:41.291
Prince of Wales had one just like it.

17:41.440 --> 17:43.727
Pedaled it round Windsor Castle.

17:44.760 --> 17:47.206
Soon I'll buy us
a place in the suburbs.

17:47.360 --> 17:48.930
Maroubra, maybe.

17:49.080 --> 17:50.923
Lane Cove.

17:51.080 --> 17:53.003
Some nice new clothes,

17:53.160 --> 17:54.685
silk stockings...

17:54.840 --> 17:57.411
electric sewing machine.

17:58.520 --> 18:00.010
Some books for the boys.

18:08.000 --> 18:12.449
Norman Bruhn had hand-picked
his gang with an eye to diversity.

18:12.600 --> 18:15.001
Snowy Cutmore
was a vicious loose cannon,

18:15.160 --> 18:18.050
George Wallace
was a loyal attack dog.

18:18.200 --> 18:19.850
While 'Razor Jack' Hayes,

18:20.000 --> 18:23.368
well, he brought
certain technical skills.

18:29.680 --> 18:31.489
And you could never be sure

18:31.640 --> 18:34.041
where the gang would strike next.

19:21.480 --> 19:22.811
Butchers a no-show.

19:22.960 --> 19:24.803
Didn't appreciate being blown up.

19:24.960 --> 19:26.564
Can't say I blame him.

19:26.720 --> 19:28.802
Oh, yeah, those two blokes
selling your snow

19:28.960 --> 19:30.291
up on Oxford Street?

19:30.440 --> 19:31.885
Gone back to the pie factory.

19:32.040 --> 19:33.929
Probably worried about
their throats gettin" slashed.

19:34.080 --> 19:36.686
Jeez, thanks for your insight, May.

19:38.120 --> 19:39.485
Barney's here.

19:39.640 --> 19:42.211
Don't be so familiar.
He's Mr Dalton to you.

19:42.360 --> 19:43.964
Where you been?

19:44.120 --> 19:45.451
Out delivering spuds.

19:45.600 --> 19:47.489
Ran from Cleveland Street,
down Crown, to the wharfs.

19:47.640 --> 19:49.130
Do Sprints?
Anyone in the groggeries?

19:49.280 --> 19:51.123
Yeah, Sprints with...
Ma, can I have a scone?

19:51.280 --> 19:54.045
Thinking of trying this weekend... No,
not a soul. Bruhn's scared 'em all off.

19:54.200 --> 19:55.531
What about Kippax Street? Mack's?

19:55.680 --> 19:57.364
Ma, can I've a scone?
No, you can't.

19:57.520 --> 19:58.851
You'll spoil your figure.

19:59.000 --> 20:00.570
Will you two stop talking football?!

20:00.720 --> 20:02.961
Actually, all of youse,
just get out of me kitchen.

20:03.120 --> 20:04.610
Go on, piss off!

20:08.880 --> 20:10.450
Not you.

20:24.560 --> 20:25.891
Ugh!

20:37.080 --> 20:38.570
We need more blades.

20:40.960 --> 20:42.849
You make sure
that Greg, Octopus, Barney,

20:43.000 --> 20:44.490
make sure all the boys carry 'em.

20:45.880 --> 20:47.450
If that's what you want.

20:47.600 --> 20:49.284
Well, I don't want.

20:50.280 --> 20:52.487
I don't want to stoop
to Norman Bruhn's filthy level,

20:52.640 --> 20:55.450
but you have to retaliate first.

20:56.880 --> 20:59.042
You do have a friend
in a high place.

20:59.200 --> 21:00.929
Maybe he could help.

21:05.280 --> 21:08.204
I don't think the Lord's gonna
piss Bruhn off for me

21:08.360 --> 21:10.249
no matter how hard I pray.

21:13.680 --> 21:16.160
I was thinking
of a more earthly power.

21:18.800 --> 21:21.371
So Norman Bruhn's behind
this mayhem?

21:21.520 --> 21:25.650
And you, Jeffs, the Devines, have all
been turning the other cheek?

21:25.800 --> 21:27.564
You wanted someone
to tell you what's what.

21:27.720 --> 21:29.245
Norman Bruhn, that's what.

21:29.400 --> 21:30.925
Now go out and arrest him.

21:31.080 --> 21:33.651
Your men, they're prepared
to stand in court,

21:33.800 --> 21:35.370
swear it was Bruhn who out 'em?

21:38.120 --> 21:39.610
Nah.

21:41.400 --> 21:44.882
St Vincent's treated
22 razor victims this past month.

21:45.960 --> 21:47.485
One lad lost an ear.

21:48.480 --> 21:50.369
Another had his sniffer lopped off.

21:51.360 --> 21:53.601
Not one of them'd say
how they came to be hurt.

21:53.760 --> 21:56.445
Folk are scared of Bruhn
and his droobs.

21:56.600 --> 21:59.763
And they're scared of you and yours
and Jeffs and the Devines.

22:00.760 --> 22:02.091
Pains me to say this,

22:02.240 --> 22:04.242
but not one of you's in line
for a sainthood.

22:07.560 --> 22:11.531
Everything was just fine before Bruhn
swanned up from Melbourne.

22:14.440 --> 22:17.284
Until one of you lot breaks your
precious code of silence,

22:17.440 --> 22:19.647
there's precious little I can do
about him.

22:27.080 --> 22:30.448
We turn over a place,
couple of days it opens up again.

22:30.600 --> 22:32.887
Making next to no boodle.

22:33.040 --> 22:35.566
Told you these Sydney sheilas
weren't pushovers.

22:35.720 --> 22:37.802
They got a lot of dosh and muscle.

22:37.960 --> 22:40.440
No, this is bull, Norm.
We should just...

22:42.600 --> 22:43.840
Shut up.

22:44.000 --> 22:45.331
show some balls
and fix the bitches...

22:45.480 --> 22:47.005
Shut up, you galah.

22:50.360 --> 22:52.124
Mr Bruhn.

22:52.280 --> 22:54.203
Inspector Mackay,
Darlinghurst Police.

22:55.240 --> 22:56.730
I believe you've already had
the pleasure

22:56.880 --> 22:58.723
of Detective Sergeant Wickham's
acquaintance.

22:58.880 --> 23:00.769
We're conducting
a Search for illegal weapons

23:00.920 --> 23:04.322
under section 4.1
of the Pistol Licensing Act 1927.

23:12.800 --> 23:14.290
Interesting.

23:15.280 --> 23:17.009
That's not a pistol.

23:19.080 --> 23:20.969
Here's a puzzler, Detective Wickham.

23:21.120 --> 23:22.963
Why would a man carry a razor
in his pocket

23:23.120 --> 23:24.565
when he pays another man
to shave him?

23:24.720 --> 23:26.768
It's not illegal.

23:28.960 --> 23:30.610
Get 'em

23:37.880 --> 23:40.167
You want to watch out, Mr Bruhn.

23:40.320 --> 23:42.448
You're making a name for yourself.
Yeah?

23:42.600 --> 23:44.443
Aye.

23:44.600 --> 23:46.967
Which means we'll be keeping
a nice close eye on you.

23:59.520 --> 24:04.082
Luigi, give us half a dozen more
of your best Bengals, will ya?

24:31.760 --> 24:33.444
Go on, show us what you got.
Get off.

24:33.600 --> 24:35.090
I hate bloody footy.

24:35.240 --> 24:37.368
All that runnin" and sweatin'

24:37.520 --> 24:38.885
Never would have guessed.

24:39.040 --> 24:40.405
What do you want, George?

24:40.560 --> 24:41.971
I want your wallet, Wally.

24:42.120 --> 24:43.610
Wallet, Wally. Wallet, Wally.

24:55.400 --> 24:56.322
Arrgh!

25:27.000 --> 25:30.129
It wasn't his face or even his arm.

25:30.280 --> 25:33.602
Barney Dalton was one of the most
popular rugby league players

25:33.760 --> 25:35.888
of his era.

25:36.040 --> 25:38.771
But not after a severed
Achilles tendon.

25:38.920 --> 25:41.002
Not after Norman Bruhn.

25:50.480 --> 25:51.686
Ma.

25:51.840 --> 25:53.410
They're for Barney and Wally.

25:53.560 --> 25:55.642
Pass me that cake tin.

25:55.800 --> 25:57.211
The Jew's here.
Hey?

25:57.360 --> 25:58.691
Phil The Jew.

25:58.840 --> 26:00.410
Here in our house?

26:00.560 --> 26:02.130
Morning.

26:03.120 --> 26:04.610
How's your boys?

26:07.160 --> 26:09.766
Well, Barney will walk with a limp for
the rest of his days

26:09.920 --> 26:12.207
and Wally, well, he's not winning
any beauty pageants.

26:12.360 --> 26:14.840
He was no oil painting
to begin with.

26:16.520 --> 26:18.329
You know, I knew Bruhn was a bastard,

26:18.480 --> 26:22.201
but this...
this was a real bastard act.

26:22.360 --> 26:24.647
Well, you know what his game is,
don't you?

26:24.800 --> 26:27.167
He's gonna go through all our people
till he gets to us.

26:27.320 --> 26:29.641
You, me, Tilly.

26:29.800 --> 26:31.211
Yeah, well, I'm not scared of him.

26:31.360 --> 26:32.771
He's welcome to the cockney slag.

26:32.920 --> 26:33.842
Kate,

26:34.000 --> 26:37.607
if he takes out just one of us,
he's gonna be unstoppable.

26:37.760 --> 26:41.526
Every hood in the city is gonna be
howling to join his push.

26:41.680 --> 26:45.287
Bruhn is changing the rules.
We gotta change with it.

26:45.440 --> 26:47.249
How?

26:47.400 --> 26:49.880
You said a private meeting
of important personages,

26:50.040 --> 26:51.849
so what the fuck is she doing here?!

26:52.000 --> 26:53.445
We gotta put bad blood aside.

26:53.600 --> 26:56.524
Look, I know it's toilsome,
but we've got a common problem here.

26:56.680 --> 26:58.842
There's only one thing common
in here.

27:01.720 --> 27:04.326
Right. So, Bruhn's the problem,
we kill the slasher.

27:04.480 --> 27:07.211
Problem solved. Couple bullets...

27:08.200 --> 27:09.201
What?

27:09.360 --> 27:11.966
You wanna bring
every copper in Sydney down on us?

27:12.960 --> 27:15.327
They got a thing about murders.
They hang you for it.

27:15.480 --> 27:17.926
Oh, maybe you could pull
the trigger, do us all a favour.

27:18.080 --> 27:19.764
Mrs Leigh does have a point.

27:19.920 --> 27:22.161
Look, we're all suffering
the slings and arrows

27:22.320 --> 27:25.290
of an outrageous loss of fortune,
thanks to this Bruhn.

27:25.440 --> 27:27.522
Your customers are only going
to stay away in more droves

27:27.680 --> 27:30.331
if they think they're gonna meet their
maker if they come up this way.

27:30.480 --> 27:32.209
Got an idea, do you, Jeffs?
Scare him off.

27:32.360 --> 27:33.885
Shoot him in the knee.

27:35.360 --> 27:36.964
Both knees.

27:37.120 --> 27:38.565
Then we drive him
to a railway station,

27:38.720 --> 27:40.688
put a sign round his neck -
'Return to Melbourne'.

27:40.840 --> 27:42.171
Just kill him.

27:42.320 --> 27:43.651
It's for the best.

27:43.800 --> 27:45.848
Jim?
They got a point, Till.

27:46.000 --> 27:47.889
Our boy Frank Green
will do the shooting.

27:48.040 --> 27:50.441
What, the Little Gunman?

27:50.600 --> 27:53.365
I hear he's tops against chandeliers,
not so flash against the living.

27:53.520 --> 27:55.602
Anything we suggest, she pooh-poohs!

27:55.760 --> 27:58.286
My boy Greg Gaffney's
your bloke.

27:58.440 --> 27:59.726
He's got guts.

27:59.880 --> 28:03.327
Spends his time carousing
at your depraved groggeries.

28:03.480 --> 28:04.811
You ever heard of pots and Kettles?

28:04.960 --> 28:06.928
It really upsets me
to be in your proximity.

28:07.080 --> 28:09.765
It took a while,
but eventually the council of war

28:09.920 --> 28:12.844
thrashed out a plan
to kneecap Norman.

28:13.000 --> 28:15.924
Big Jim Devine would choose the gun,

28:16.080 --> 28:18.560
Kate Leigh would provide the gunman

28:18.720 --> 28:20.882
and Phil Jeffs' boys,
the Kelly brothers,

28:21.040 --> 28:23.611
they were to be the backup plan.

28:23.760 --> 28:26.923
Norman Bruhn was problem solved.

28:28.800 --> 28:30.882
But then Tilly Devine went home,

28:31.040 --> 28:32.644
hatched her own grand plan

28:32.800 --> 28:35.531
and kept it all to herself

28:35.680 --> 28:37.842
You want me to shoot Norman Bruhn?

28:38.000 --> 28:39.331
Yeah.

28:39.480 --> 28:42.051
Do the job Kate Leigh's too chicken to
see done proper.

28:42.200 --> 28:43.531
Kill him, eh?

28:43.680 --> 28:45.682
Jeez, oh, yeah. Sure thing.

28:45.840 --> 28:47.205
I'm your gunman.

28:47.360 --> 28:48.691
I can do it.

28:48.840 --> 28:50.569
Do it like that.

28:50.720 --> 28:53.007
You'd pay me, right?

28:53.160 --> 28:55.731
Thir..

28:55.880 --> 28:57.370
20 quid.

29:00.400 --> 29:02.164
But didn't Jim agree
to just nobble him?

29:02.320 --> 29:04.687
Ah, Jimmy's not thinking straight.

29:04.840 --> 29:08.925
Soon as he sees the headline 'Bruhn Dead',
he'll know my way was best.

29:10.400 --> 29:12.368
You the gunman
or aren't you, Frankie?

29:13.520 --> 29:15.761
You want the street chiming
Greg Gaffney's name?

29:15.920 --> 29:18.571
You want him called the Gunmen
or you?

29:20.360 --> 29:22.089
I'll fix him for you, Tilly.

30:20.600 --> 30:22.284
No sheilas in here, love.

30:24.840 --> 30:27.241
Can I please have a sherry?

30:28.240 --> 30:30.004
Alright, just this once.

30:51.120 --> 30:52.531
You don't need that.

30:52.680 --> 30:54.603
Pretty as a picture already.

30:57.200 --> 30:59.362
You're going to get me into trouble,
Little Gunman.

31:01.280 --> 31:02.930
Buy you all this, did he?

31:04.960 --> 31:06.928
You know he's married.

31:07.080 --> 31:08.730
Couple of kids.

31:11.560 --> 31:13.449
I don't know what you see in him.

31:13.600 --> 31:16.080
He's old and he's from Melbourne.
He's the best.

31:18.640 --> 31:20.210
He's the best.

31:27.360 --> 31:29.203
Not going to happen, Frank.

31:31.440 --> 31:32.930
Nellie, Nellie.

31:37.720 --> 31:39.370
I'll pay you.

32:36.240 --> 32:38.083
Dan has the bag.

32:38.240 --> 32:40.686
Ned is a big man.

32:40.840 --> 32:44.003
He is by him.

32:44.160 --> 32:46.561
Baby Ray has a dog.

32:46.720 --> 32:48.802
The dog is little.

32:48.960 --> 32:50.644
Good boy, Keithy.

32:52.360 --> 32:53.850
You need a shave.

32:55.680 --> 32:59.571
Nell has the doll on her lap.

33:00.840 --> 33:05.880
She will put her doll in the cot.

33:20.080 --> 33:21.684
Where'd you get that?

33:23.600 --> 33:25.090
Working.

33:36.200 --> 33:37.725
Good girl.

33:45.480 --> 33:47.687
Sometimes Wal gets lucky,

33:47.840 --> 33:51.242
but more often than not it's just her
and her pug-ugly daughter.

33:51.400 --> 33:54.609
K- K-Katie's ripe for the pickin'.

33:54.760 --> 33:58.003
But pick our moment, blow the door.

33:58.160 --> 34:00.367
Scare the daylights
out of her livin" tits.

34:00.520 --> 34:02.045
She'll think her number's up.

34:03.680 --> 34:05.523
I like my idea better.

34:05.680 --> 34:07.603
Just kill Kate and Tilly.

34:07.760 --> 34:10.684
You need me to spell it out for you
again, Snow?

34:11.960 --> 34:15.726
You need me to remind you
how well known Kate and Tilly are?

34:15.880 --> 34:17.210
How killing 'em would be the act

34:17.360 --> 34:20.887
of a short-sighted galoot
who didn't value his neck?

34:22.199 --> 34:23.690
You not got that?

34:25.480 --> 34:26.811
I got it.

34:26.960 --> 34:28.485
Are you sure?

34:29.600 --> 34:32.763
Seems there's an itch in your daks
you're just longin" to scratch.

34:34.159 --> 34:35.764
I'm sweet.

34:36.800 --> 34:38.928
You're the one lettin" the beer
go warm.

34:47.480 --> 34:49.766
Snowy Cutmore had yet another plan.

34:49.920 --> 34:52.286
He was going to kill his boss
and take over the gang.

34:52.440 --> 34:54.601
But he'd have to join
a queue of people

34:54.760 --> 34:57.161
wanting to do Norman Bruhn harm
that night.

34:58.800 --> 35:00.643
Give him a packarding from me.

35:01.960 --> 35:03.450
Let's go.

35:06.720 --> 35:08.882
And it was a long queue.

35:09.880 --> 35:11.609
Rest when the job's done.

35:11.760 --> 35:13.444
What's going on?

35:13.600 --> 35:14.761
Nothing.

35:14.920 --> 35:17.207
What, are you still dirty
about Kate Leigh?

35:17.360 --> 35:19.681
The woman just raised her voice
and you keeled over...

35:19.840 --> 35:22.571
It was the right way to handle Bruhn
and you know it!

35:22.720 --> 35:25.451
Just trying to keep the cops
off our backs.

35:28.160 --> 35:30.891
You and me'll swing past
Leigh's joint.

35:31.040 --> 35:32.405
Whatever you say, Norm.

35:32.560 --> 35:33.925
Meet up later.

35:34.080 --> 35:35.411
Come on, Georgie Porgie.

35:35.560 --> 35:37.847
How come you get a boozer
nickname like Razor Jack

35:38.000 --> 35:39.650
and I get Georgie Porgie?

35:40.640 --> 35:43.007
Oi, Grandpa.

35:49.120 --> 35:50.849
Mack's Cafe, mate.

36:14.040 --> 36:16.088
isn't that Kate Leigh?

36:16.240 --> 36:17.844
That was Leigh.

36:19.360 --> 36:21.328
Get our cut from Mack's first, eh?

36:22.840 --> 36:24.285
She'll keep.

36:24.440 --> 36:25.930
You're the boss.

36:27.000 --> 36:28.809
Ah, you gents be wanting me further?

36:28.960 --> 36:30.450
Yeah, wait here.

36:40.320 --> 36:41.970
I'm the Gunmen.

36:44.200 --> 36:45.804
I'm the Gunmen.

36:47.160 --> 36:48.650
I'm the Gunmen.

37:10.640 --> 37:13.371
You gents need a cab?
You best push off, mate.

37:15.280 --> 37:16.770
Free world, isn't it?

37:17.760 --> 37:19.489
Push off.

37:23.320 --> 37:24.810
I'm the Gunmen.

37:35.760 --> 37:37.330
Who the bloody hell's that?

37:54.160 --> 37:56.049
What the hell?

38:00.000 --> 38:01.490
Who's that?

38:03.400 --> 38:04.890
That's Bruhn

38:06.680 --> 38:08.523
Help.

38:08.680 --> 38:10.250
I've been shot.

38:17.480 --> 38:19.528
Let's go. You'll be right, mate.

38:42.560 --> 38:44.289
Mr Bruhn?

38:45.680 --> 38:47.330
Inspector Mackay.

38:48.840 --> 38:50.330
You remember me?

38:52.160 --> 38:54.288
I won't shelf anyone.

38:54.440 --> 38:56.488
Oh, come on, Norman.

38:56.640 --> 38:58.404
Who shot you?

38:59.920 --> 39:02.241
I won't be a copper.

39:04.440 --> 39:06.010
You got nothing to lose, mate.

39:06.160 --> 39:07.844
Do the right thing.

39:09.480 --> 39:11.642
Fuck... off.

39:11.800 --> 39:13.643
Mr Bruhn...
No, you heard him.

39:15.800 --> 39:17.723
My husband's got nothing to say.

39:49.160 --> 39:50.571
Don't leave me.

40:07.960 --> 40:09.450
Ma'am.

40:10.520 --> 40:13.649
Mrs Bruhn, my condolences.

40:18.120 --> 40:22.364
Did he say anything?
Did he tell you who shot him?

40:27.880 --> 40:29.370
No, he didn't.

40:31.840 --> 40:33.808
And I wouldn't tell you if he had.

40:40.840 --> 40:42.649
He's dead?

40:42.800 --> 40:45.371
That wasn't the plan.
Yeah, it wasn't me, Kate.

40:45.520 --> 40:48.524
I never even got the chance.
Well, who? Hmm?

40:48.680 --> 40:50.011
Who killed him?

40:50.160 --> 40:51.844
We only caught a glimpse.

40:53.080 --> 40:54.570
I think it was Frank Green.

40:57.880 --> 41:00.724
Tilly fucking Devine.

41:11.800 --> 41:14.883
I had the guts to do it!
Fucking pussy!

41:15.040 --> 41:17.088
I had the guts to do it!
