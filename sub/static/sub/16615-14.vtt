<i>Previously on "Once Upon a Time"...</i>

00:02.336 --> 00:03.535
You killed my father!

00:03.637 --> 00:05.404
I merely <i>ordered</i> him killed.

00:05.841 --> 00:07.674
Dead men tell no tales.

00:08.845 --> 00:10.778
[Groans]

00:11.136 --> 00:14.338
Emma Swan, will you marry me?

00:14.440 --> 00:16.206
Yes!

00:16.475 --> 00:18.642
This is your chance
at love and happiness.

00:18.744 --> 00:19.977
That's him?

00:19.983 --> 00:21.382
Go get him.

00:21.580 --> 00:23.714
[Indistinct conversations]

[Groans, screams]

00:32.223 --> 00:34.291
Aah!

00:34.393 --> 00:35.993
Ahh.

00:36.095 --> 00:37.828
Hope that didn't sting.

[Horse whinnies]

01:19.246 --> 01:21.146
Where is she?

01:21.248 --> 01:22.514
Where's Snow White?

01:22.616 --> 01:23.815
The cabin, your majesty.

01:23.917 --> 01:25.784
She was seen entering before dawn.

01:25.886 --> 01:27.419
There's been no movement inside since.

01:27.521 --> 01:29.755
Gather the neighboring villagers.

01:29.857 --> 01:31.757
I want them to see justice served

01:31.859 --> 01:34.259
on their beloved princess.

01:36.697 --> 01:39.131
Regina, if you kill Snow White

01:39.233 --> 01:41.366
you'll only harden
the people against you.

01:41.468 --> 01:43.902
You have to prove to them
that you can show mercy

01:44.004 --> 01:46.304
if you want them to love
you like they do <i> her.</i>

01:46.407 --> 01:49.941
I didn't come here to show mercy.

01:50.044 --> 01:52.411
I came for a heart.

02:14.435 --> 02:15.701
Regina. What happened?

02:15.803 --> 02:17.402
She's gone.

02:21.041 --> 02:23.077
Now...

02:23.577 --> 02:27.345
someone is going to
tell me where she went.

02:30.284 --> 02:32.217
Are you really going to protect her?

02:32.319 --> 02:34.316
She doesn't care about you.

02:35.222 --> 02:37.433
<i>I'm</i> the one who cares.

02:38.392 --> 02:41.259
Snow White doesn't love you.

02:43.597 --> 02:44.412
<i>I</i> do.

02:44.418 --> 02:46.084
Don't listen to her.

02:48.035 --> 02:49.601
She doesn't care about love.

02:53.474 --> 02:55.140
I should know.

02:55.209 --> 02:58.643
I was there when she threw
her chance at love away.

02:58.746 --> 03:00.231
Tinker Bell.

03:02.850 --> 03:04.497
Hello, Regina.

03:05.252 --> 03:06.518
What are you doing here?

03:06.620 --> 03:08.716
Shouldn't you be living
in a tulip somewhere?

03:08.722 --> 03:10.488
What happened to me doesn't matter.

03:10.758 --> 03:12.290
Just look at you.

03:12.736 --> 03:14.712
You've done nothing but
fill your heart with hate

03:14.718 --> 03:16.184
since we saw each other.

03:16.430 --> 03:18.997
But it doesn't have to be that way.

03:19.066 --> 03:21.066
What do you care about any of this?

03:21.168 --> 03:23.652
I care because this started with me.

03:24.905 --> 03:27.272
I showed you your future
with the pixie dust.

03:27.341 --> 03:31.376
The one with the lion tattoo...
you should be with him.

03:31.478 --> 03:33.011
He's still out there.

03:33.113 --> 03:36.314
Pixie dust doesn't dictate what I do.

03:36.416 --> 03:39.417
Nothing and no one does.

03:39.486 --> 03:42.487
Pixie dust doesn't dictate anything.

03:42.556 --> 03:45.490
It just shows you the possibilities.

03:45.559 --> 03:46.992
It's up to you.

03:48.262 --> 03:50.562
Thanks, but no, thanks.

03:50.664 --> 03:52.964
I'm happy the way I am.

03:53.066 --> 03:54.866
I don't believe you.

03:54.935 --> 03:57.075
You're just saying that
to hide the real reason

03:57.081 --> 04:00.238
that you won't take a chance on love.

04:00.340 --> 04:02.207
You don't think you deserve it.

04:07.281 --> 04:10.215
You really think you know me so well?

04:10.284 --> 04:11.188
Hmm?

04:12.452 --> 04:16.021
I'm going to spare this
wretched person's life

04:16.089 --> 04:18.023
to prove she's wrong.

04:18.473 --> 04:20.223
I do love you.

04:21.028 --> 04:23.695
I love... all of you.

04:24.965 --> 04:28.166
I hope you learn from this act of mercy,

04:28.235 --> 04:31.203
because next time, it will be your last.

04:39.862 --> 04:41.174
Robin: Look, I don't mean to be rude,

04:41.180 --> 04:43.014
but why wouldn't Regina tell me

04:43.083 --> 04:45.350
that she had a double, just like I did?

04:45.452 --> 04:49.154
[Sighs] Because she wants
to keep her dark side secret.

04:49.223 --> 04:51.890
The truth is, if it were up
to her, I'd no longer exist.

04:52.055 --> 04:53.054
You mean to say

04:53.060 --> 04:54.993
you're the ne'er-do-well
version of Regina,

04:54.999 --> 04:56.799
just as I am with the other Robin Hood?

04:56.964 --> 04:58.029
Well, how about that?

04:58.482 --> 04:59.994
Somebody in this godforsaken town

05:00.000 --> 05:02.100
I actually have
something in common with.

05:02.264 --> 05:03.592
I beg your pardon?

05:05.138 --> 05:06.738
I'm a queen,

05:06.840 --> 05:10.108
not some burlap-loving
peasant who sleeps in dirt.

05:10.210 --> 05:12.086
Excuse me... I sleep on hay.

05:12.098 --> 05:15.309
Which is on dirt, but
there is... separation.

05:15.315 --> 05:17.148
No matter. You can
insult me all you want.

05:17.217 --> 05:20.719
It doesn't change the fact
that you and I are alike.

05:20.821 --> 05:23.054
We both know that we don't belong here.

05:24.124 --> 05:25.435
Perhaps.

05:26.460 --> 05:29.261
So maybe I <i> had</i> the solution.

05:29.363 --> 05:30.695
New York?

05:30.797 --> 05:32.430
I think not.

05:32.532 --> 05:35.333
I suppose you know
where I should go, then?

05:35.435 --> 05:38.336
Well, the one place you
know you <i> do</i> belong...

05:38.438 --> 05:41.139
back to the realm I
created with my wish.

05:41.241 --> 05:42.407
I'll send you back.

05:42.413 --> 05:44.980
And what do <i> you</i>
get out of the bargain?

05:45.608 --> 05:47.846
Well, you're a thief, aren't you?

05:49.182 --> 05:52.117
I want you to steal something.

05:52.219 --> 05:54.152
[Owl hooting]

05:54.254 --> 05:55.592
This is a graveyard.

05:55.598 --> 05:58.365
Bodies aren't the only
things buried here.

05:58.659 --> 06:00.091
What are you after?

06:00.160 --> 06:02.027
What exactly is this about?

06:04.831 --> 06:07.098
Please stop asking questions...

06:07.567 --> 06:08.967
and dig.

06:28.221 --> 06:29.688
Emma, it's beautiful.

06:29.790 --> 06:31.289
I am so happy for you.

06:31.391 --> 06:32.324
Me too, Mom.

06:32.330 --> 06:33.562
Thank you. I just never thought...

06:33.595 --> 06:36.763
Well, if it makes you feel
any better,<i> I</i> did.

06:37.429 --> 06:39.064
So, how did Hook pop the question?

06:39.166 --> 06:41.455
On board a romantic cruise
on the <i> Jolly Roger?</i>

06:41.461 --> 06:42.318
Well...

06:42.324 --> 06:44.570
Did he make Smee and the
rest of the crew serenade you?

06:44.576 --> 06:46.438
We may never know,
because I kind of said yes

06:46.540 --> 06:47.939
before he had a chance. [Chuckles]

06:47.945 --> 06:49.736
I cannot wait to tell your father

06:49.742 --> 06:50.809
that we have a wedding to plan.

06:50.911 --> 06:53.199
Oh, about that... we're going to wait

06:53.205 --> 06:54.946
a little while before we start planning.

06:55.048 --> 06:56.681
Oh. Why?

06:56.783 --> 06:58.783
Well, Gideon's still out there,

06:58.885 --> 07:00.788
and even though I defeated him once,

07:00.794 --> 07:01.720
we don't really know what he's up to,

07:01.822 --> 07:03.688
and I don't feel like I
can focus on anything else

07:03.694 --> 07:05.090
until I've really dealt with that.

07:05.192 --> 07:07.125
Actually, you're going to have to.

07:07.194 --> 07:08.059
What now?

07:08.161 --> 07:09.094
The Evil Queen.

07:09.196 --> 07:10.562
What about her?

07:10.664 --> 07:11.763
Is that an engagement ring?

07:11.865 --> 07:13.269
Oh. Yeah.

07:13.296 --> 07:16.197
Um... Hook proposed.

07:16.470 --> 07:18.136
[Gasps] Emma.

07:19.439 --> 07:21.306
I'm happy for you. I really am.

07:21.408 --> 07:23.074
Thanks. That means a lot.

07:23.080 --> 07:25.280
That just leaves the question...
What happened to the Evil Queen?

07:25.286 --> 07:26.277
She's still a snake right?

07:26.346 --> 07:28.246
I have no idea. She got loose.

07:28.281 --> 07:32.350
And if she <i> has</i> figured out
a way to escape her mortal coil,

07:32.459 --> 07:35.127
well, there's no telling
what evil she could be up to.

07:36.156 --> 07:39.591
[Grunting, panting]

07:42.596 --> 07:44.896
Couldn't you use magic to dig this hole?

07:45.470 --> 07:48.272
You're right, but what
would be the fun in that?

07:48.343 --> 07:50.319
You don't mind a little
dirty work, do you?

07:52.572 --> 07:53.438
[Clank]

07:53.540 --> 07:55.140
And there it is...

07:55.242 --> 07:57.308
the sound of my victory.

08:06.620 --> 08:07.752
A pair of scissors?

08:07.854 --> 08:10.922
Don't underestimate them.
These blades are enchanted.

08:12.225 --> 08:15.693
Capable of cutting a
person from their fate.

08:15.796 --> 08:17.729
You want to use them on Regina...

08:17.831 --> 08:19.631
to break her from her destiny.

08:19.637 --> 08:21.070
No.

08:21.268 --> 08:25.603
My plan for her involves
something much more permanent.

08:25.705 --> 08:29.541
I'm going to use these
blades to finally separate us,

08:29.721 --> 08:31.639
so once and for all...

08:33.246 --> 08:35.080
I can destroy her.

08:38.768 --> 08:40.835
[Buoy bell clanging]

08:49.821 --> 08:52.073
You can tell the ocean your secrets,

08:52.167 --> 08:53.623
but the question is

08:53.692 --> 08:56.492
whether the ocean will tell you hers.

08:56.561 --> 08:57.827
[Chuckles]

08:57.896 --> 08:59.696
Nemo.

08:59.798 --> 09:01.965
I wanted to say goodbye.

09:02.033 --> 09:03.299
I wouldn't be standing
here without your help,

09:03.368 --> 09:05.501
but now that I am, I'm afraid it's time

09:05.570 --> 09:07.770
for your brother Liam and
for the rest of my crew

09:07.839 --> 09:10.173
to set sail again on
the <i> Nautilus.</i>

09:10.242 --> 09:11.857
Well, that is a sad occasion, indeed.

09:11.928 --> 09:13.276
[Chuckles]

09:13.345 --> 09:17.647
Not as sad knowing that
you took my advice...

09:17.749 --> 09:18.807
set aside your revenge

09:18.813 --> 09:20.900
and found what was
missing in your life...

09:21.119 --> 09:23.253
a family.

09:23.355 --> 09:24.320
Aye.

09:26.691 --> 09:29.359
That, I did. [Exhales deeply]

09:29.461 --> 09:30.967
What is it?

09:30.973 --> 09:32.444
Is something wrong?

09:33.431 --> 09:36.935
My past has caught up with me,

09:36.941 --> 09:38.835
and this time, I've hurt the family

09:38.903 --> 09:40.770
of the woman I mean to marry.

09:40.839 --> 09:42.538
[Chuckles] Well, I suppose...

09:42.607 --> 09:46.042
[Sniffs] I suppose I shouldn't
be surprised, you know?

09:46.144 --> 09:48.945
I <i> was</i> a villain, and
villains don't get happy endings.

09:49.014 --> 09:51.214
[Chuckles] You still could.

09:51.283 --> 09:52.749
Have you asked for forgiveness?

09:52.772 --> 09:54.071
That's just it...

09:54.252 --> 09:56.319
You're the only other person who knows.

09:56.388 --> 09:58.755
Once they find out...

09:58.823 --> 10:01.024
there may be no coming back.

10:01.092 --> 10:03.493
Be careful, my boy.

10:03.561 --> 10:07.530
Guilt can be as corrosive
to the soul as revenge.

10:07.632 --> 10:09.299
Which means...

10:09.334 --> 10:12.001
that you must tell this
woman and her family the truth

10:12.070 --> 10:15.672
<i>or</i> keep it a secret
and learn to forgive yourself.

10:15.774 --> 10:17.173
What if I can't?

10:17.275 --> 10:19.542
Either way, you must.

10:19.611 --> 10:22.245
Heed my advice, Killian... please.

10:22.314 --> 10:23.913
Seek forgiveness.

10:23.982 --> 10:26.916
Because whatever happened,
it will always stay with you.

10:37.239 --> 10:38.428
Looking for this?

10:38.496 --> 10:41.397
Such a lovely and powerful pen.

10:43.668 --> 10:46.469
So, you did figure out a
way to de-snake yourself.

10:48.206 --> 10:49.305
That's not yours.

10:49.407 --> 10:50.340
Give it back.

10:50.408 --> 10:52.313
Unh-unh-unh!

10:53.111 --> 10:55.244
<i>I'll</i> be holding on to this.

10:55.313 --> 10:56.713
I wouldn't want you ruining my plans

10:56.815 --> 10:59.048
by writing me out of existence

10:59.150 --> 11:01.150
with a swoop of your authorial pen.

11:01.252 --> 11:04.287
That's what you think I
want... to make you disappear?

11:04.356 --> 11:05.632
Well, isn't it?

11:06.591 --> 11:09.058
After all, that's
what <i> Regina</i> wants.

11:09.127 --> 11:11.594
That's because she thinks
you're the worst parts of her.

11:13.665 --> 11:15.398
But you <i> don't?</i>

11:15.500 --> 11:19.202
I know there's good in you,
just like there's bad in her.

11:19.270 --> 11:20.870
That means you can change.

11:20.972 --> 11:22.438
And you thought you can break the rules

11:22.507 --> 11:25.341
by using your author powers
to give me a little push?

11:26.711 --> 11:28.911
I don't know what I was going to do.

11:28.980 --> 11:31.247
Well, I suppose I should be flattered.

11:32.684 --> 11:33.850
Look at yourself.

11:33.918 --> 11:37.186
You finally got the revenge
you wanted on Snow White,

11:37.255 --> 11:38.721
and are you happy?

11:39.657 --> 11:41.157
Perhaps not.

11:41.226 --> 11:42.825
But I <i> will</i> be.

11:44.095 --> 11:45.027
What are you planning?

11:45.033 --> 11:47.166
Something you won't like.

11:47.365 --> 11:48.631
That's why I'm here.

11:48.637 --> 11:51.454
Eventually, you'll
realize it's for the best.

11:51.752 --> 11:53.918
Because you were right, Henry.

11:54.139 --> 11:55.405
You're still my son.

11:55.473 --> 11:56.773
What are you going to do?

11:59.444 --> 12:01.043
Give this to Regina.

12:01.049 --> 12:04.217
And, remember, no matter what
anyone tries to tell you...

12:06.998 --> 12:08.651
I love you.

12:20.532 --> 12:22.198
Regina, we need to talk.

12:22.267 --> 12:24.467
Daddy, please.

12:24.536 --> 12:27.003
I've heard it all before.

12:27.071 --> 12:31.407
I know... you don't think
revenge will make me happy.

12:31.509 --> 12:33.910
But I'm going to find out.

12:34.012 --> 12:36.112
Don't try to stop me.

12:36.118 --> 12:37.911
I'm not here to try to stop you.

12:37.982 --> 12:40.750
Actually, I'm here to help you get it.

12:40.819 --> 12:41.884
What?

12:41.894 --> 12:45.529
Do you remember the first time
that you cantered Rocinante?

12:45.623 --> 12:46.989
Well, of course I do.

12:47.058 --> 12:49.225
I watched you ride him across the field

12:49.294 --> 12:50.626
outside our manor.

12:50.695 --> 12:52.795
No matter how far you went,

12:52.897 --> 12:54.931
I could still see that
smile on your face.

12:54.999 --> 12:58.367
It wasn't a horse that put
a smile on my face, Daddy.

13:00.678 --> 13:02.338
That was the day I met Daniel.

13:05.276 --> 13:06.776
I know.

13:06.782 --> 13:08.121
I know.

13:08.546 --> 13:10.646
I want you to be happy again.

13:10.652 --> 13:13.754
But I don't believe killing
Snow White will do that.

13:13.918 --> 13:15.418
Maybe by my helping you,

13:15.520 --> 13:18.187
you'll be able to move
on so you <i> can.</i>

13:19.620 --> 13:21.586
How can <i> you</i> help <i> me?</i>

13:23.017 --> 13:24.149
With this.

13:25.230 --> 13:27.430
This is one of your
mother's spell books,

13:27.532 --> 13:29.365
that I've kept hidden from you.

13:29.434 --> 13:31.167
It has a map inside

13:31.269 --> 13:33.202
that will lead us to a powerful object

13:33.304 --> 13:36.706
that can help find Snow White.

13:36.774 --> 13:38.574
[Exhales sharply]

13:38.676 --> 13:40.710
Daddy.

13:42.113 --> 13:43.346
Snow: Wait. Isn't that...

13:43.448 --> 13:44.680
Regina: Page 23...

13:44.782 --> 13:46.578
the page that magically appeared to me

13:46.680 --> 13:48.480
with what I thought could be an ending

13:48.548 --> 13:50.582
to my story with Robin...

13:50.684 --> 13:52.484
a happy... ending.

13:52.586 --> 13:55.019
Inside, it was just
a cruel twist of fate,

13:55.121 --> 13:57.622
showing me an ending
that could never be.

13:57.724 --> 13:58.756
What does it mean?

13:58.762 --> 14:00.728
It means the Evil Queen has found him...

14:00.927 --> 14:02.462
the other Robin, that is...

14:02.477 --> 14:04.199
and she wants me to
know that she'll hurt him

14:04.205 --> 14:05.830
unless I face her.

14:05.899 --> 14:07.799
"One last time."

14:07.901 --> 14:09.300
Wait. How is that even possible?

14:09.369 --> 14:11.936
Without Gideon's sword, she can't
hurt you without hurting herself.

14:11.983 --> 14:14.050
Unless, of course, she
figured out another way.

14:14.207 --> 14:16.441
Regina, you can't go. You'd
be walking into a trap.

14:16.543 --> 14:18.042
Well, we can't just leave Robin.

14:18.144 --> 14:20.111
We won't.<i> I'll</i>
go. This is my fault.

14:20.213 --> 14:21.613
I'm the one who convinced
you to bring him here.

14:21.715 --> 14:22.732
This is on me.

14:22.738 --> 14:24.682
Emma, you don't have
anything to make up for.

14:24.784 --> 14:26.584
You were just trying to help.

14:26.686 --> 14:28.253
Henry: She's really gonna do this.

14:28.355 --> 14:30.722
Maybe I was wrong to
think she could change.

14:30.824 --> 14:31.890
I'm sorry, kid.

14:32.194 --> 14:33.560
Regina, what are you gonna do?

14:33.655 --> 14:34.854
Go alone.

14:35.072 --> 14:37.362
This is <i> my</i> battle
to fight, and it has been

14:37.464 --> 14:39.497
ever since I tried to
destroy my dark side

14:39.599 --> 14:41.032
up on that rooftop in New York.

14:41.134 --> 14:42.934
You can't do this
yourself. Emma's right.

14:43.003 --> 14:44.235
I have to.

14:44.337 --> 14:46.371
If I don't, this won't just
end with Robin getting hurt.

14:46.473 --> 14:48.873
She'll hurt everyone I
care about... all of you.

14:48.975 --> 14:50.909
And I can't let that happen.

14:51.945 --> 14:54.779
The Evil Queen is going
to get what she wants.

14:54.881 --> 14:57.248
Our fight ends today.

15:02.902 --> 15:05.102
Can't say this is
<i>exactly</i> what I had in mind

15:05.204 --> 15:07.304
when I offered my services,

15:07.373 --> 15:10.274
unless I'm misreading the signals

15:10.343 --> 15:13.144
and things are about to take
a much more exciting turn.

15:13.212 --> 15:15.112
[Chuckles] Keep dreaming.

15:15.118 --> 15:16.684
Oh. Too bad.

15:17.984 --> 15:20.084
Uh, but I'm afraid
you may have grossly...

15:22.536 --> 15:24.669
overestimated my importance to her.

15:24.675 --> 15:26.841
I mean, Regina may have charged in

15:26.847 --> 15:29.066
to save Robin the Hero's
life, but <i> me?</i>

15:29.128 --> 15:30.661
Much less likely.

15:31.867 --> 15:33.864
Huh? Enchanted ropes.

15:33.933 --> 15:37.067
The only way you're going
anywhere is if I allow it.

15:37.136 --> 15:39.436
And that's not going to happen

15:39.442 --> 15:43.377
until I lure Regina
here and destroy her.

15:43.476 --> 15:45.015
Do you really think killing Regina

15:45.021 --> 15:46.454
is gonna solve your problems?

15:46.921 --> 15:49.230
All it will do is make a martyr of her,

15:49.394 --> 15:50.948
and then nobody will
be able to look at you

15:51.050 --> 15:52.216
without thinking of her.

15:52.318 --> 15:54.814
Believe me, that part is no fun at all.

15:54.871 --> 15:56.571
Oh, well, I suppose
you have a better idea.

15:56.673 --> 15:57.839
As a matter of fact, I do.

15:57.941 --> 15:59.407
Release me.

15:59.509 --> 16:01.259
Why the hell would I do that?

16:01.494 --> 16:04.178
Because you were right...
I don't belong here.

16:04.247 --> 16:06.013
And neither do you.

16:06.116 --> 16:07.081
[Scoffs]

16:07.183 --> 16:08.483
Maybe Regina was right.

16:08.551 --> 16:10.384
Maybe there is a reason that I'm here,

16:10.453 --> 16:12.186
but it's not to save her.

16:12.288 --> 16:13.187
It's to save <i> you.</i>

16:13.289 --> 16:14.188
[Laughs]

16:14.257 --> 16:16.124
I don't know what you've heard about me,

16:16.545 --> 16:20.094
but I don't need saving.

16:20.163 --> 16:21.696
Don't you?

16:21.731 --> 16:23.464
'Cause it looks to me as
if you could really use

16:23.566 --> 16:24.665
a place to get a fresh start.

16:24.767 --> 16:26.634
A fresh start?

16:26.703 --> 16:28.236
Doing what?

16:28.338 --> 16:30.571
My land is rather big.

16:30.640 --> 16:34.642
I'm sure we could find something
that'll pique your interest.

16:34.744 --> 16:37.445
I'd think about it if I was you.

16:37.826 --> 16:40.893
Because regardless of how
things go down here today,

16:41.142 --> 16:43.476
you and I both know...
in a town full of heroes,

16:43.482 --> 16:45.953
a villain like you
doesn't stand a chance.

16:46.452 --> 16:50.191
The only one who doesn't stand a chance

16:50.293 --> 16:51.893
is my...

16:51.995 --> 16:53.728
better half.

16:54.599 --> 16:56.984
As much as I enjoy our walks, Daddy,

16:56.990 --> 16:59.397
you can just give me the
map and the spell book,

16:59.403 --> 17:00.468
and I can magic us there.

17:00.570 --> 17:01.636
It'll be much quicker.

17:01.738 --> 17:03.171
There's no need.

17:03.764 --> 17:05.205
We're here.

17:06.387 --> 17:07.642
[Scoffs]

17:15.018 --> 17:16.717
What is this place?

17:19.055 --> 17:20.887
Mother's spell book never
would have led us here.

17:20.957 --> 17:23.891
It's practically
dripping with light magic.

17:23.992 --> 17:25.126
You're right.

17:25.194 --> 17:27.007
That's because I never
learned about this place

17:27.057 --> 17:28.256
from a spell book.

17:30.099 --> 17:32.466
Then what brought you here?

17:33.217 --> 17:34.702
The fairy.

17:36.248 --> 17:37.681
Tinker Bell.

17:40.476 --> 17:42.543
So you lied to me.

17:43.613 --> 17:46.480
This was never about getting my revenge.

17:46.583 --> 17:48.549
No, Regina.

17:48.618 --> 17:51.719
This is about getting
something much better.

17:51.821 --> 17:53.421
Follow me.

17:57.126 --> 18:00.194
That's what we're here for...

18:00.263 --> 18:01.929
Cupid's Arrow.

18:02.031 --> 18:04.966
You brought me here for a love spell?

18:05.068 --> 18:06.734
It's not a love spell.

18:06.803 --> 18:08.636
I know they don't work.

18:08.705 --> 18:11.038
This arrow is a tool.

18:11.107 --> 18:15.409
It will lead you to gaze
upon the person you love most.

18:15.478 --> 18:19.680
The fairy told me about the
man with the lion tattoo.

18:19.782 --> 18:21.215
You could use it to find him.

18:21.317 --> 18:23.351
You betrayed me.

18:24.587 --> 18:27.755
I always thought you were
the <i> one</i> person on my side.

18:29.626 --> 18:31.926
Regina, don't you see that I am?

18:31.995 --> 18:33.561
Enough!

18:34.387 --> 18:35.867
What are you doing?

18:38.234 --> 18:40.601
Getting what I came for.

18:44.841 --> 18:46.374
My revenge.

18:51.514 --> 18:53.447
<i>Dead men tell no tales.</i>

18:54.183 --> 18:55.016
[Groans]

19:01.791 --> 19:03.724
That's David's father.

19:08.197 --> 19:09.897
It was you.

19:11.000 --> 19:12.199
Emma, let me explain.

19:12.268 --> 19:13.734
No, it seems very clear to me.

19:13.803 --> 19:15.202
I swear to you... I wanted to tell you.

19:15.305 --> 19:16.704
I tried.

19:17.188 --> 19:18.306
But then you found that ring,

19:18.374 --> 19:21.809
and I just couldn't bear
to ruin that happiness.

19:21.911 --> 19:23.511
How could you do this?

19:25.481 --> 19:27.114
I've been asking myself
the same question,

19:27.183 --> 19:29.088
and all I can say

19:29.094 --> 19:31.017
is that I was a broken
man for a very long time,

19:31.023 --> 19:31.996
and I did horrendous things.

19:32.002 --> 19:35.022
I'm not talking about that.
I'm talking about <i> this.</i>

19:35.124 --> 19:36.657
[Exhales sharply]

19:37.042 --> 19:38.465
You were about to
burn your own memories.

19:38.471 --> 19:40.394
Why would you do that?

19:40.496 --> 19:42.713
Because I was ashamed, Emma,

19:42.719 --> 19:44.787
and scared of losing you

19:44.808 --> 19:46.416
and everything that matters to me.

19:46.422 --> 19:48.102
And you really think that would happen
after everything we've been through?

19:48.171 --> 19:49.403
You tell <i> me...</i>
how am I supposed to

19:49.472 --> 19:52.373
sit across from your mother
and father at the table

19:52.605 --> 19:54.471
and look them in the
eye after what I've done?

19:54.477 --> 19:56.610
I'm not saying it would be easy.

19:56.679 --> 19:59.013
You know them. You know
they would forgive you.

19:59.048 --> 20:00.181
That's who they are.

20:00.249 --> 20:02.550
This isn't just about <i> them.</i>

20:02.652 --> 20:04.218
This is about <i> me.</i>

20:05.134 --> 20:07.662
I already destroyed my own family once,

20:07.668 --> 20:08.601
and that was hard enough,

20:08.607 --> 20:11.307
but knowing that I destroyed
yours, too, I just...

20:12.795 --> 20:16.263
I didn't know how I
could live with that.

20:16.366 --> 20:18.399
You come to me, Hook, and you lean on me

20:18.501 --> 20:20.668
and you trust me!

20:20.737 --> 20:23.838
We have to stop hiding
things from each other.

20:24.246 --> 20:26.941
The man I fell in love
with would know that.

20:27.009 --> 20:30.144
You would know that we
would do things together.

20:31.675 --> 20:32.847
Emma...

20:32.870 --> 20:34.436
That is what I agreed to marry.

20:34.617 --> 20:37.385
That is what I thought
that we were together.

20:38.957 --> 20:41.023
Until you're ready for that...

20:43.693 --> 20:44.992
then we can talk.

21:09.602 --> 21:11.099
[Buoy bell clanging]

21:11.729 --> 21:13.695
[Exhales sharply]
Triple-check everything.

21:13.797 --> 21:16.031
I don't know when we'll see land again.

21:16.100 --> 21:19.234
You never told me where
you were heading off to.

21:19.303 --> 21:23.171
You know very well that
destinations never matter.

21:23.207 --> 21:24.773
It's what we learn on the way.

21:26.960 --> 21:28.659
I didn't expect to see you, Killian,

21:28.713 --> 21:31.114
which has me wondering what happened.

21:32.516 --> 21:34.316
You gave me two good pieces of advice,

21:34.418 --> 21:35.884
and I took neither.

21:35.986 --> 21:37.285
Can you fix it?

21:38.288 --> 21:40.088
I don't think so.

21:41.759 --> 21:45.093
I'm not the man she needs me to be.

21:45.162 --> 21:48.597
And I need... I need
to find that man again.

21:48.699 --> 21:50.899
And how are you gonna do that?

21:50.968 --> 21:52.183
Do you remember what you told me

21:52.189 --> 21:53.668
the first time I was on this vessel?

21:53.771 --> 21:57.172
You said the <i> Nautilus</i>
could help a man discover

21:57.241 --> 21:58.240
who he could be.

21:58.342 --> 22:01.810
And I was hoping...

22:01.879 --> 22:04.546
I was hoping you might
have room for one more.

22:06.250 --> 22:08.016
Well, then.

22:08.085 --> 22:12.120
Captain Hook is always
welcome on the <i> Nautilus.</i>

22:12.189 --> 22:14.089
We push off at nightfall.

22:26.332 --> 22:28.299
You shouldn't have come here.

22:28.305 --> 22:31.106
I couldn't let anything happen to you.

22:33.010 --> 22:34.543
[Gasps]

22:34.611 --> 22:36.711
He's not the one you
should be worried about.

22:39.917 --> 22:42.717
Oh. So that's your plan.

22:42.820 --> 22:44.686
You're going to separate us.

22:44.788 --> 22:45.954
Then what?

22:46.056 --> 22:49.324
Then I'm going to do what you
tried to do to <i> me...</i>

22:49.426 --> 22:50.959
destroy you.

[Birds chirping]

23:02.039 --> 23:04.372
Now we're getting somewhere.

23:04.475 --> 23:06.641
Why? What are you doing?

23:08.011 --> 23:10.712
Making good use of Mother's spell book,

23:10.814 --> 23:13.215
like you said we would...

23:13.317 --> 23:14.950
to find Snow White.

23:17.488 --> 23:19.221
Regina, please.

23:19.289 --> 23:22.457
Not everyone gets a
second chance at love.

23:23.794 --> 23:26.728
Put all this aside and go find that man.

23:26.830 --> 23:28.330
Remember how you said

23:28.398 --> 23:34.035
this arrow will lead me to gaze
upon the person I love most?

23:36.440 --> 23:39.441
Well, there's a very thin
line between love and hate.

23:41.211 --> 23:42.777
[Sizzling]

23:45.315 --> 23:47.582
There.

23:47.684 --> 23:50.485
That's much better.

23:50.554 --> 23:55.657
Now it will lead me to gaze upon
the person I <i> hate</i> most.

23:55.759 --> 23:57.492
[Laughs]

24:01.431 --> 24:03.331
Snow White.

24:06.403 --> 24:08.937
It's always about
revenge with us, isn't it?

24:10.574 --> 24:12.774
You know what?

24:12.876 --> 24:14.843
Trim away.

24:14.945 --> 24:17.612
After all the damage
you've done because of me,

24:17.714 --> 24:19.881
I'm ready.

24:19.950 --> 24:23.451
This town's just not big
enough for the both of us.

24:23.520 --> 24:26.021
At last, we agree on something.

24:34.298 --> 24:36.031
[Both gasp]

24:41.738 --> 24:43.872
[Breathing shakily]

25:06.363 --> 25:08.063
let's finish this.

25:11.068 --> 25:12.534
Gladly.

25:27.943 --> 25:30.220
Why is it headed towards your castle?

25:31.413 --> 25:34.206
She must know I'm not there.

25:35.017 --> 25:39.152
So, she thinks she can steal from me.

25:39.254 --> 25:40.687
[Scoffs]

25:40.789 --> 25:43.690
Well, she'll see.

25:48.397 --> 25:49.796
Where is she?

25:53.869 --> 25:55.001
Hiding, are you?

26:00.943 --> 26:02.075
No.

26:04.179 --> 26:05.479
No!

26:07.883 --> 26:09.816
The spell should have worked.

26:10.752 --> 26:14.554
It should have led me to gaze
upon the person I hate most!

26:23.465 --> 26:24.664
Oh, Regina.

26:25.109 --> 26:26.275
[Voice breaking] No.

Aaaaah!

26:29.872 --> 26:31.571
[Crying]

26:43.852 --> 26:45.652
You tried to destroy me

26:45.721 --> 26:48.455
because you couldn't stand
looking at the darkness?

26:48.933 --> 26:50.924
Well, I can't stand
looking at the light.

26:50.993 --> 26:53.426
Well, you don't have
to worry about that.

27:04.373 --> 27:06.740
You really believe
you're better than me.

27:06.808 --> 27:08.742
Huh? Stronger than me?!

27:11.847 --> 27:13.880
Because you think you filled

27:13.982 --> 27:15.917
that nasty little hole inside you

27:15.923 --> 27:19.791
with love and friendship and hope?

27:21.290 --> 27:23.957
Well, you've been fooling
yourself, because you haven't.

27:24.927 --> 27:27.193
<i>I'm</i> still what's inside of you.

27:27.296 --> 27:29.763

You're wrong.

[Grunts]

27:38.607 --> 27:42.976
All those things in my life
you can't stand looking at...

27:43.045 --> 27:44.444
they're real.

27:44.737 --> 27:45.908
And now that I have them,

27:45.914 --> 27:48.315
you will <i> never</i>
take them away from me.

28:32.394 --> 28:34.961
I'm going to do what we never could.

28:36.965 --> 28:39.499
I'm going to be brave for both of us

love from Henry and Robin

29:24.479 --> 29:27.047
and the people I care most about.

And in return, I'm taking
back some of your darkness.

Sorry about that.

It's just a lamp. [Chuckles]

I'm more worried about the
things that really matter,

Please tell me he's okay.

30:32.831 --> 30:34.564
Oh, yes. He's... he's fine.

30:34.666 --> 30:36.399
I actually kept my word

30:36.468 --> 30:38.435

30:39.938 --> 30:40.970
Home.

30:41.073 --> 30:43.873
You mean... back to his land,

30:44.131 --> 30:45.664
the realm you created with your wish?

30:45.670 --> 30:46.469
How?

30:48.012 --> 30:49.786
Gold was too busy worrying about his son

30:49.792 --> 30:51.047
to mind the shop.

30:51.116 --> 30:52.348
[Scoffs]

30:52.417 --> 30:54.184

30:55.854 --> 30:57.487
So, he's gone, then.

31:00.258 --> 31:02.592
Oh, I'm sorry you didn't
get to say goodbye.

31:04.029 --> 31:06.029
It's probably better like this.

the door of that tavern

all those years ago?

31:13.538 --> 31:16.539
If I had, I wouldn't be here.

31:16.608 --> 31:19.542
I wouldn't have Henry or my family

31:19.644 --> 31:20.977
or this town.

31:22.547 --> 31:24.948
I can't imagine a life without all that.

That isn't your happy ending.

31:30.722 --> 31:33.089
No, it isn't.

31:35.894 --> 31:38.661
But it did give me hope
when I needed it most,

31:38.730 --> 31:41.664
and that was just as important.

31:41.733 --> 31:44.901
I wouldn't mind a little
bit of that right now.

can get a fresh start.

[Laughing] But where that is, I...

32:05.290 --> 32:07.023
haven't a clue.

32:09.161 --> 32:12.295
I think I know someone who can help.

32:16.305 --> 32:18.735
You want me to use the
pen to send her... where?

32:18.803 --> 32:20.837
Well, that's the thing... I don't know.

32:20.906 --> 32:25.642
I-It has to be someplace
where... she can start over,

32:26.036 --> 32:27.280
have a chance at a new life.

32:27.286 --> 32:28.811
Isn't this against the rules?

32:28.880 --> 32:30.446
Actually, the rules say

32:30.515 --> 32:33.850
I'm not supposed to affect the
lives of people in <i> my</i> book.

32:33.919 --> 32:36.219
She's not... not technically, at least.

32:36.288 --> 32:39.248
Hang on a minute. This is the
Evil Queen we're talking about.

32:39.254 --> 32:41.120
Wasn't she just trying to murder us all?

32:41.126 --> 32:42.025
And Zelena makes a great point.

32:42.127 --> 32:43.293
This is the same exact person

32:43.361 --> 32:46.529
who put us under a sleeping
curse like five minutes ago.

32:46.598 --> 32:48.735
Maybe she can start by undoing it

32:48.741 --> 32:49.599
before we trust her.

32:49.668 --> 32:52.869
Well, she... she told me
everything she knows about that.

32:52.938 --> 32:57.389
It won't be easy, but at least
now we know where to start.

32:58.961 --> 33:00.361
As for her... [Sighs]

33:00.418 --> 33:02.866
Regina, I know you
want to believe in her,

33:03.415 --> 33:05.874
but not everyone is redeemable.

33:06.585 --> 33:08.051
But <i> I</i> was.

33:08.774 --> 33:10.653
And that means <i> she</i> is.

33:10.722 --> 33:12.522
And I've given her what she needs now

33:12.624 --> 33:15.358
to make the right choices.

33:15.427 --> 33:17.393
We just have to give her that chance,

33:17.495 --> 33:19.062
like you all gave <i> me.</i>

33:19.164 --> 33:21.764
[Chuckles] Heroes are so gullible.

33:21.833 --> 33:23.366
When you wake up a few months from now

33:23.435 --> 33:26.830
to find her crushing your
heart, don't blame me.

33:32.935 --> 33:35.402
Well, I... hope it won't.

All I can say is, I'm
truly sorry for everything.

I have my ideas.

If you're gonna kidnap me
again, may I humbly request

36:45.737 --> 36:47.837
I'm allowed to finish my ale first?

36:47.939 --> 36:50.273
I'm not here to kidnap you.

36:50.660 --> 36:53.209
And I'm... I'm sorry about that.

36:54.358 --> 36:55.724
So, if you're standing
here, can I assume

36:55.730 --> 36:58.798
that the villain plan
didn't work out so well?

36:59.617 --> 37:01.217
It didn't.

37:01.286 --> 37:03.386
But, for the first time in...

37:03.488 --> 37:06.189
well, forever...

37:06.291 --> 37:07.924
I'm okay with that.

37:07.992 --> 37:09.592
You are?

37:09.661 --> 37:11.327
And why is that?

37:11.396 --> 37:13.062
Let's just say...

37:13.139 --> 37:15.439
I've had a change of heart.

37:15.500 --> 37:17.333
- Have you, now?
- I have.

37:17.435 --> 37:18.601
[Inhales sharply]

37:18.670 --> 37:23.506
And I was wondering if... maybe...

37:23.879 --> 37:26.045
I might buy you a drink?

37:27.779 --> 37:31.113
Well, seeing as this is <i> my</i> realm,

37:31.216 --> 37:32.882
how 'bout I buy <i> you</i> one?

37:49.901 --> 37:51.934

Are you going somewhere?

37:57.326 --> 37:58.808
I've been looking
everywhere for you and Emma.

37:58.877 --> 38:01.544
No, I was just, uh, grabbing some
stuff from the <i> Jolly Roger.</i>

38:01.579 --> 38:03.946
Is... is everything okay?

38:04.048 --> 38:06.382
Oh, more than okay. [Chuckles]

38:06.484 --> 38:09.352
I can hardly believe
I'm about to say this.

38:09.420 --> 38:10.686
Regina did it.

38:10.927 --> 38:13.122
She actually did it.

38:13.872 --> 38:15.060
Did what?

38:15.949 --> 38:17.883
Vanquished the Evil Queen...

38:18.004 --> 38:20.563
redeemed her, even,
gave her a happy ending,

38:20.665 --> 38:23.599
even if she doesn't realize it yet.

38:23.668 --> 38:26.770
The... The Evil Queen
got a happy ending?

38:26.776 --> 38:27.809
I know.

38:27.938 --> 38:29.171
I honestly didn't think it was possible

38:29.177 --> 38:32.708
for someone like her... not
after all of these years.

38:32.810 --> 38:34.677
But it <i> was.</i>

38:35.033 --> 38:36.643
And tonight reminded me of something

38:36.649 --> 38:38.900
that I hope I never forget again...

38:40.051 --> 38:42.963
love can save even the darkest souls.

38:43.814 --> 38:45.747
You just have to believe in it.

38:47.680 --> 38:49.746
Speaking of love...

38:51.095 --> 38:52.361
Emma told me.

38:52.463 --> 38:55.841
Killian, I couldn't
be happier for you...

38:56.151 --> 38:57.717
both of you.

38:58.995 --> 39:00.832
She has waited a long time

39:00.838 --> 39:03.272
to find the right person
with whom to share her life.

39:04.842 --> 39:06.943
I'm so happy it's you.

39:15.095 --> 39:16.621
You'll let her know?

39:17.598 --> 39:19.221
Uh, know... know what?

39:19.324 --> 39:21.057
Oh, that Regina's okay.

39:21.159 --> 39:23.426
Yeah, yeah. Of course... course I will.

39:23.528 --> 39:24.961
Okay.

39:25.663 --> 39:26.796
Um...

39:27.879 --> 39:29.821
It's so cold out here. Go home.

40:11.476 --> 40:13.776
Are you ready for adventure, Captain?

40:13.878 --> 40:14.844
No.

40:14.946 --> 40:16.612
I'm done running.

40:16.681 --> 40:18.914
I'm going back to Emma.

40:18.983 --> 40:20.549
Even villains get second chances...

40:20.652 --> 40:23.319
and, hopefully, even third ones.

40:23.388 --> 40:25.087
I couldn't be happier to hear that.

40:25.156 --> 40:27.056
[Inhales sharply]

40:27.158 --> 40:30.660
I wish you all the happiness.

40:30.762 --> 40:31.727
And I, you.

40:31.829 --> 40:34.296
[Rumbling, klaxon blaring]

40:34.365 --> 40:35.197
What happened?

40:35.299 --> 40:36.599
I-I don't know.

40:36.634 --> 40:38.701
[Rumbling]

40:38.803 --> 40:40.670
We're... submerging, Captain.

40:40.772 --> 40:41.937
I didn't give that order.

40:42.006 --> 40:43.272
But <i> I</i> did.

40:44.898 --> 40:45.997
Who are you?

40:48.846 --> 40:50.212
What do you want?

40:50.314 --> 40:52.582
Sorry to commandeer
your vessel, Captain,

40:52.735 --> 40:55.170
but I'm afraid for what I have planned,

40:55.620 --> 40:57.453
you can't be in Storybrooke.

41:29.571 --> 41:30.236
