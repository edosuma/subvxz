00:06.000 --> 00:09.000
NARRATOR: Towards the end

00:06.000 --> 00:09.000
of the 2008 campaign,

00:09.000 --> 00:12.000
the Republican party, terrified at their own

00:12.000 --> 00:16.000
sinking poll numbers, attempted to link Barack Obama

00:16.000 --> 00:20.000
to radical leftist figures to make him appear un-American.

00:20.000 --> 00:24.000
First was the controversial Reverend Jeremiah Wright.

00:24.000 --> 00:28.000
I say motherfuck America,
motherfuck America's mother,

00:28.000 --> 00:30.000
motherfuck America's daddy!

00:30.000 --> 00:31.000
America can eat a dick!

00:31.000 --> 00:33.000
America can lick the balls!

00:33.000 --> 00:36.000
When that failed, Republicans tried linking Obama

00:33.000 --> 00:36.000
MAN:
I admit, I am envious of you.

00:36.000 --> 00:40.000
with 10-year-old domestic terrorist Huey Freeman

00:36.000 --> 00:41.000
In China, if you lose
$20 billion, they shoot you.

00:38.000 --> 00:39.000
Oh.

00:39.000 --> 00:41.000
My glasses.

00:40.000 --> 00:43.000
after discovering the two were MySpace friends.

00:41.000 --> 00:42.000
Hey!

00:41.000 --> 00:45.000
Here, they give you another
$20 billion.

00:42.000 --> 00:44.000
Dorothy!
I'm coming, baby!

00:43.000 --> 00:45.000
Did they leave each other
glitter comments?

00:44.000 --> 00:45.000
I'm coming!

00:45.000 --> 00:47.000
The public has
a right to know.

00:46.000 --> 00:47.000
Amusing.

00:47.000 --> 00:50.000
Okay, this is a little boy
who thinks that Jesus is black,

00:47.000 --> 00:48.000
You're not taking
Dorothy!

00:47.000 --> 00:50.000
Our kickball team
is very formidable this year.

00:49.000 --> 00:50.000
You should have paid
your car note, asshole!

00:50.000 --> 00:51.000
Ronald Reagan is the devil

00:50.000 --> 00:53.000
That car's been paid for
since 1975!

00:50.000 --> 00:53.000
My granddaughter Ming
is the team captain.

00:52.000 --> 00:53.000
and the government
is lying about 9/11.

00:53.000 --> 00:56.000
Kids like this need to be
on America's shit list,

00:53.000 --> 00:56.000
W-W-Wait, wait.
Is this 324 Timid Deer Lane?

00:53.000 --> 00:56.000
I am hoping it will be
an epic contest.

00:56.000 --> 00:57.000
not our friend list.

00:56.000 --> 00:58.000
Hell, no!
This is 327!

00:56.000 --> 00:59.000
No offense to your
granddaughter, Mr. Long Do,

00:57.000 --> 01:01.000
Obama did his best to downplay the relationship.

00:58.000 --> 00:59.000
That's 324!

00:59.000 --> 01:02.000
but our team
shits on your team.

01:01.000 --> 01:03.000
Look, I have many,
many friends on MySpace.

01:03.000 --> 01:05.000
I-- I pretty much
add anybody.

01:03.000 --> 01:06.000
We'll see.

01:05.000 --> 01:07.000
I don't know
who this Huey Freeman is,

01:05.000 --> 01:06.000
Huh?

01:06.000 --> 01:10.000
I hate to spoil such a beautiful
day with such a close friend

01:07.000 --> 01:10.000
but he doesn't stand
for what I stand for

01:10.000 --> 01:15.000
and I denounce, I repudiate,
and condemn him.

01:10.000 --> 01:13.000
talking about the unpleasantness
of business.

01:13.000 --> 01:17.000
However, my associates
are getting nervous.

01:14.000 --> 01:16.000
Damn! What now?

01:15.000 --> 01:19.000
Basically fuck him.

01:17.000 --> 01:21.000
We need our money.
All of it.

01:18.000 --> 01:20.000
Ha-ha! What up, little man?
What up?

01:20.000 --> 01:21.000
You bring that extra controller?
Yep.

01:21.000 --> 01:24.000
That's what's up.
Come on in, nigga.

01:23.000 --> 01:25.000
That's not possible.

01:25.000 --> 01:27.000
Hey, man, apologize
to your granddad for me

01:25.000 --> 01:27.000
Unfortunate.

01:27.000 --> 01:28.000
about that mix-up earlier.

01:28.000 --> 01:30.000
I been waiting to get rid of
that piece of shit car anyway.

01:29.000 --> 01:32.000
Now, Mr. Do, I'm sure we can
find another way

01:30.000 --> 01:32.000
You know,
'cause I called 'em, right?

01:32.000 --> 01:34.000
I was like: "Y'all need to get
this motherfucker out of here,

01:32.000 --> 01:33.000
to work this out.

01:33.000 --> 01:35.000
I'm listening.

01:34.000 --> 01:36.000
'cause I don't want this
no more."

01:35.000 --> 01:38.000
Say, how's your gambling
addiction?

01:36.000 --> 01:37.000
I'm about to cop the new shit,
nigga.

01:37.000 --> 01:40.000
You know what I mean?
Oh, okay.

01:38.000 --> 01:40.000
Much better.

01:40.000 --> 01:42.000
So everything's okay?
Okay?

01:40.000 --> 01:42.000
Now.

01:42.000 --> 01:45.000
Everything is better
than okay, it's Thugnificent!

01:42.000 --> 01:44.000
I'm never playing
kickball again.

01:44.000 --> 01:45.000
Come on, boy,
you have to do this.

01:45.000 --> 01:47.000
You just wait to see
the moves your boy is making.

01:45.000 --> 01:47.000
Ed Wuncler asked for you
by name.

01:47.000 --> 01:49.000
Know what I'm saying? Federal
Reserve calling me for loans,

01:47.000 --> 01:49.000
It's because of him I quit
the game in the first place

01:49.000 --> 01:51.000
Obama and shit?
Know what I'm saying?

01:49.000 --> 01:52.000
and gave Jennifer Herman
a permanent severe limp.

01:51.000 --> 01:52.000
Nigga, you need some money?

01:52.000 --> 01:54.000
Man, who the fuck is this
calling me--?

01:52.000 --> 01:54.000
Look, nobody needs to be
reminded of that tragic day

01:53.000 --> 01:57.000
NARRATOR: I tracked down the notoriously

01:53.000 --> 01:57.000
reclusive Huey Freeman here,

01:54.000 --> 01:56.000
Ha.
Warren Motherfucking Buffett.

01:54.000 --> 01:56.000
when you gave that girl
a permanent severe limp.

01:56.000 --> 01:57.000
What up, nigga?
Aw, nigga,

01:56.000 --> 01:58.000
It was the Junior League Championship

01:57.000 --> 02:00.000
where he lives with his Grandfather and brother.

01:58.000 --> 02:00.000
stop beating around the bush.
How much you need?

01:58.000 --> 02:01.000
against Wuncler's team, and Ed had paid off the refs.

02:00.000 --> 02:01.000
Two billion?

02:01.000 --> 02:02.000
I'm giving you eight.

02:01.000 --> 02:02.000
And, oh, you guys were losing bad.

02:02.000 --> 02:03.000
The first thing I notice about Huey

02:02.000 --> 02:04.000
And don't pay me back,
nigga, you good.

02:02.000 --> 02:03.000
It was a blowout.

02:03.000 --> 02:06.000
There were calling him
the Tiger Woods of kickball,

02:04.000 --> 02:05.000
is his incredibly large hair.

02:04.000 --> 02:07.000
All right, my nigga.

02:05.000 --> 02:09.000
The second thing I notice is his permanent scowl.

02:06.000 --> 02:07.000
before the wife-cheating thing.

02:07.000 --> 02:09.000
Uh, let's just turn
the game on.

02:07.000 --> 02:09.000
Now they just
call him "loser."

02:09.000 --> 02:13.000
How does it feel to be labeled
a domestic terrorist?

02:09.000 --> 02:12.000
RILEY:
Oh, yo! It's Sergeant Gutta!

02:09.000 --> 02:11.000
MAN: Huey, you suck!

02:11.000 --> 02:13.000
WOMAN:
You suck!

02:12.000 --> 02:14.000
Turn it up, man!
Turn it up!

02:13.000 --> 02:14.000
GRANDDAD: The crowd started laughing,

02:14.000 --> 02:17.000
Eh, I'm retired.

02:14.000 --> 02:16.000
THUGNIFICENT:
Oh, man,

02:14.000 --> 02:16.000
not this motherfucker again.

02:14.000 --> 02:18.000
and we all know you don't like to be laughed at.

02:16.000 --> 02:18.000
I swear to God, every time
I turn the TV on,

02:17.000 --> 02:21.000
So then, now that it looks
like Obama is going to win,

02:18.000 --> 02:19.000
I see this nigga.

02:18.000 --> 02:20.000
And you snapped.

02:20.000 --> 02:21.000
You went crazy.

02:21.000 --> 02:23.000
as a black
African American negro,

02:23.000 --> 02:27.000
are you merely excited
or are you extremely excited

02:23.000 --> 02:24.000
So is this it?

02:23.000 --> 02:26.000
ANNOUNCER:
Freeman has hit her

02:23.000 --> 02:26.000
with the pitch.

02:24.000 --> 02:26.000
Is this what
the kids like?

02:26.000 --> 02:27.000
This what's hot
in the streets, Riley?

02:26.000 --> 02:27.000
Oh, the horror.

02:27.000 --> 02:31.000
that everything is going
to change forever?

02:27.000 --> 02:29.000
Well, he sold over
a million records

02:27.000 --> 02:30.000
And believe me, folks,
this was no accident.

02:30.000 --> 02:32.000
and he do have the number one
song in the country

02:30.000 --> 02:31.000
He meant to do that.

02:31.000 --> 02:33.000
Eh.

02:32.000 --> 02:33.000
and he got a dance.

02:32.000 --> 02:33.000
If that girl is still alive,

02:33.000 --> 02:35.000
I felt my sphincter clinch

02:33.000 --> 02:36.000
she will undoubtedly have
a permanent and severe limp.

02:34.000 --> 02:36.000
Is that what it takes
for a nigga

02:35.000 --> 02:38.000
and my scrotum contract in shock

02:36.000 --> 02:38.000
to go platinum nowadays,
a dance?

02:37.000 --> 02:39.000
ANNOUNCER:
One thing is certain:

02:38.000 --> 02:39.000
at his response.

02:38.000 --> 02:39.000
Man, anybody can make up
a dance.

02:39.000 --> 02:41.000
I swear that boy
just likes to be miserable.

02:39.000 --> 02:41.000
She will never
play kickball again.

02:41.000 --> 02:43.000
He can't enjoy nothing.

02:41.000 --> 02:44.000
And neither
should Huey Freeman.

02:43.000 --> 02:45.000
All he wanna talk about
is the Bilderberg Group,

02:43.000 --> 02:44.000
Man, you look crazy.

02:44.000 --> 02:46.000
You ain't gotta make up
no dance

02:44.000 --> 02:46.000
Well, too bad.
Ed Wuncler owns everything,

02:45.000 --> 02:46.000
the Federal Reserve
and all that bullshit.

02:46.000 --> 02:48.000
I don't know where
he get that from.

02:46.000 --> 02:48.000
just because he got one.

02:46.000 --> 02:48.000
including the bank
that owns this house,

02:48.000 --> 02:50.000
He didn't get it from me.
I believe in hope and change.

02:48.000 --> 02:51.000
I ain't gonna lie though,
I kinda mess with it.

02:48.000 --> 02:50.000
and he just got $20 billion
in bailout money.

02:50.000 --> 02:54.000
NARRATOR: Nobody knows exactly how old

02:50.000 --> 02:54.000
Robert Freeman is.

02:50.000 --> 02:51.000
And I'm trying
to be his best friend.

02:51.000 --> 02:53.000
I mean, but your stuff
is good too.

02:51.000 --> 02:53.000
If Ed Wuncler tells me to jump,
I'm gonna say how high,

02:53.000 --> 02:55.000
Hey, you just wait
till my new album drops.

02:54.000 --> 02:56.000
Not even Robert Freeman himself.

02:54.000 --> 02:55.000
and throw your ass
in the air.

02:55.000 --> 02:58.000
All y'all niggas gonna see
I still got the game on smash.

02:55.000 --> 02:57.000
I'm not gonna play.

02:56.000 --> 02:58.000
But his age is estimated

02:57.000 --> 02:58.000
Okay, fine.

02:58.000 --> 03:02.000
somewhere between 80 and 120 years old.

02:58.000 --> 03:00.000
Hey, you wanna hear
some tracks?

02:59.000 --> 03:00.000
If you don't wanna play,
you don't wanna play.

03:00.000 --> 03:03.000
Ed, here he is as promised.
Now get over here, boy.

03:02.000 --> 03:03.000
This is what me
and my generation,

03:02.000 --> 03:06.000
I'm a magnificent thug

03:03.000 --> 03:07.000
but mostly me, struggled for.
Sacrificed for, you can say,

03:04.000 --> 03:06.000
Good job, Robert.

03:06.000 --> 03:09.000
I'll remember this when I do
my Christmas yacht shopping.

03:07.000 --> 03:09.000
personally individually
paved the way for.

03:07.000 --> 03:11.000
Wow. So you doing
the robot effect on your voice.

03:09.000 --> 03:11.000
The dogs were after us,
so I took off my belt

03:09.000 --> 03:10.000
GRANDDAD:
Yeah, boy!

03:10.000 --> 03:11.000
WUNCLER:
Now Huey,

03:11.000 --> 03:13.000
and started whipping
on the dogs.

03:11.000 --> 03:13.000
Yeah, it's that
Auto-Tuner, son.

03:11.000 --> 03:13.000
the Wushung/Woodcrest
Junior/Senior

03:13.000 --> 03:15.000
Then I started running.
Then I looked behind me.

03:13.000 --> 03:16.000
It lets you sing,
even if you can't sing.

03:13.000 --> 03:15.000
Harmonious Kickball Tournament
is the greatest

03:15.000 --> 03:16.000
Jesse Jackson was supposed
to be there,

03:15.000 --> 03:18.000
kickball competition
in the history of the sport.

03:16.000 --> 03:18.000
but he had jumped
into a Dumpster. Hiding.

03:16.000 --> 03:18.000
It's terrible

03:18.000 --> 03:20.000
That punk-ass.
NARRATOR:  I find it difficult

03:18.000 --> 03:20.000
One hundred and twenty-nine years ago,

03:20.000 --> 03:23.000
to determine whether Robert is a pathological liar

03:20.000 --> 03:24.000
Wow. So you used it
on this one too.

03:20.000 --> 03:24.000
my great-great Grandpa Prescott Rothschild Wuncler

03:23.000 --> 03:27.000
or suffering the early stages of dementia.

03:24.000 --> 03:26.000
Yep. Every song
on the whole CD.

03:24.000 --> 03:26.000
sailed to Wushung, China.

03:26.000 --> 03:27.000
Hot, right?

03:26.000 --> 03:29.000
The local monks had invented a game similar to baseball,

03:27.000 --> 03:31.000
So if the election is fake,
then what's really going on?

03:27.000 --> 03:31.000
Heh, yeah.

03:29.000 --> 03:33.000
except it involved a red rubber ball and a lot of kicking.

03:31.000 --> 03:33.000
The end of America.

03:31.000 --> 03:33.000
RILEY:
I thought Flonominal was

03:31.000 --> 03:33.000
supposed to be back this week.

03:33.000 --> 03:35.000
I felt despair so terrible

03:33.000 --> 03:35.000
THUGNIFICENT:
Man, that nigga, man.

03:33.000 --> 03:35.000
He originally called it "Jap baseball"

03:35.000 --> 03:37.000
I briefly consider slitting my own wrists,

03:35.000 --> 03:36.000
You know he
went and got a job?

03:35.000 --> 03:37.000
because he didn't know what country he was in

03:36.000 --> 03:38.000
A what?
I know, nigga.

03:37.000 --> 03:39.000
or bludgeoning myself about the head

03:37.000 --> 03:38.000
and didn't care.

03:38.000 --> 03:40.000
That's what I said. A job?
Can you believe this?

03:38.000 --> 03:40.000
He brought the sport back to America,

03:39.000 --> 03:42.000
with a steel pipe or baseball bat.

03:40.000 --> 03:42.000
Talking about he need
health insurance and shit.

03:40.000 --> 03:42.000
where the liberal PC bitch-asses

03:42.000 --> 03:46.000
But I brought no blade, no pipe, no bat.

03:42.000 --> 03:44.000
I'm like, "damn, nigga,
pull down your skirt."

03:42.000 --> 03:44.000
renamed it "kickball."

03:44.000 --> 03:46.000
Know what I'm saying?
Take the dick out your ass.

03:44.000 --> 03:47.000
Today, in the spirit of harmony between our two cities,

03:46.000 --> 03:48.000
Describe Riley Freeman
in one word.

03:46.000 --> 03:47.000
Acting like
little bitches, man.

03:47.000 --> 03:50.000
And this nigga Macktastic,
went back to pimping and shit.

03:47.000 --> 03:49.000
we alternate hosting a kickball tournament

03:48.000 --> 03:51.000
Mm, I'd say real nigga.

03:49.000 --> 03:52.000
known as the Wushung/Woodcrest Junior/Senior

03:50.000 --> 03:52.000
It's funny how niggas
change on you, man,

03:51.000 --> 03:53.000
"Real nigga"
is two words.

03:52.000 --> 03:54.000
know what I'm saying?
So you here all by yourself?

03:52.000 --> 03:54.000
Harmonious Kickball Tournament.

03:53.000 --> 03:54.000
I know it's two words, nigga.

03:54.000 --> 03:56.000
Real niggas
don't follow instructions.

03:54.000 --> 03:56.000
Yeah, just me.

03:54.000 --> 03:56.000
HUEY:
There's no way I'm playing.

03:56.000 --> 03:58.000
NARRATOR: This is Robert Freeman's

03:56.000 --> 03:58.000
other grandson, Riley.

03:56.000 --> 03:57.000
Hey, what's up, y'all?

03:56.000 --> 03:58.000
Because of you, I gave a girl
a permanent limp.

03:57.000 --> 04:00.000
Just got back from work.
Hey, y'all hungry?

03:58.000 --> 03:59.000
Oh, really?

03:59.000 --> 04:02.000
He's empowered by the prospect of a black president,

03:59.000 --> 04:01.000
This little girl?

04:00.000 --> 04:02.000
Oh, and Leonard.

04:02.000 --> 04:05.000
but not in the way society would hope or expect.

04:02.000 --> 04:04.000
Oh, man!

04:03.000 --> 04:07.000
That's right, Huey.
Jennifer can walk just fine.

04:04.000 --> 04:06.000
My Frosty is melted!
Damn it, Leonard!

04:05.000 --> 04:08.000
Oh, if my nigga Obama
gets up in there,

04:06.000 --> 04:08.000
What the fuck, nigga, did you
take the long way home again?

04:07.000 --> 04:08.000
Hit it, Jenny.

04:08.000 --> 04:10.000
I'm gonna act a fool!

04:08.000 --> 04:11.000
You were dominating the entire
Woodcrest Junior League,

04:09.000 --> 04:11.000
My bad, it took longer
'cause I had to ride my bike

04:10.000 --> 04:11.000
I ain't doing
no more homework, nothing.

04:11.000 --> 04:13.000
We taking over.

04:11.000 --> 04:14.000
since the car had got--
Uh, never mind, man, fuck it.

04:11.000 --> 04:12.000
and I couldn't have that.

04:12.000 --> 04:15.000
I made up the story about
Jennifer's permanent limp,

04:13.000 --> 04:14.000
Come on, what's a cop
gonna do to me?

04:14.000 --> 04:17.000
I'm gonna be like, "Don't make
me call the president, bitch."

04:14.000 --> 04:16.000
LEONARD:
Should I tell you

04:14.000 --> 04:16.000
what happened to the car?

04:15.000 --> 04:18.000
correctly assuming the emotional
trauma of the event

04:16.000 --> 04:18.000
THUGNIFICENT:
I said never mind!

04:17.000 --> 04:21.000
And the cops, he gonna be like,
"Oh, snap, Riley a real nigga,

04:18.000 --> 04:20.000
MAN:
Okay, we're back.

04:18.000 --> 04:20.000
would make you
quit the game.

04:20.000 --> 04:23.000
This is DJ Vlad
and I told you we have a very,

04:20.000 --> 04:23.000
But now I need to win this game
against the Chinese.

04:21.000 --> 04:24.000
the president's a real nigga,
we can't do nothing."

04:23.000 --> 04:25.000
very special guest
in the studio this morning.

04:23.000 --> 04:26.000
You were willing to scar me
for life over a kickball game?

04:25.000 --> 04:27.000
I can't wait.

04:25.000 --> 04:27.000
This man right here
is a legend in the game.

04:26.000 --> 04:28.000
But that's how good
of an opponent you were.

04:27.000 --> 04:29.000
In my driveway

04:27.000 --> 04:28.000
A pioneer, if you will.

04:28.000 --> 04:30.000
Give him respect,
Thugnificent!

04:28.000 --> 04:31.000
But this game is bigger
than you and me, Huey.

04:29.000 --> 04:30.000
I got planes

04:30.000 --> 04:32.000
NARRATOR: This is Otis Jenkins.

04:30.000 --> 04:33.000
What up everybody.
Man, what an honor.

04:31.000 --> 04:34.000
I present the Woodcrest
Harmonious kickball team.

04:32.000 --> 04:35.000
But in the United States, he's better known

04:33.000 --> 04:35.000
How are you, man?
Who, me?

04:34.000 --> 04:37.000
First, courtesy of Blackwater
USA, the senior squad--

04:35.000 --> 04:37.000
by his rap moniker Thugnificent.

04:35.000 --> 04:36.000
Heh, oh, you know,
I'm Thugnificent!

04:37.000 --> 04:40.000
A combination of the words "thug" and "magnificent."

04:37.000 --> 04:39.000
HUEY:
Mercenaries?

04:38.000 --> 04:40.000
What's it like for you older
cats now in the game

04:39.000 --> 04:42.000
They prefer the term
"private kickball contractors."

04:40.000 --> 04:42.000
in terms of, you know,
where you fit in musically?

04:41.000 --> 04:42.000
Otis has found success

04:42.000 --> 04:45.000
like many Negro-American entertainers today

04:42.000 --> 04:43.000
I mean, what was it like,
you know,

04:42.000 --> 04:44.000
And this
is the junior squad?

04:43.000 --> 04:45.000
when you were at your peak,
so to speak?

04:44.000 --> 04:46.000
WUNCLER:
The best the Dominican Republic

04:44.000 --> 04:46.000
has to offer.

04:45.000 --> 04:47.000
by being a professional buffoon.

04:45.000 --> 04:47.000
Which was so long ago.
I'm saying, I mean,

04:46.000 --> 04:50.000
As you can see, I've spared
no expense for victory.

04:47.000 --> 04:50.000
Are you supporting
Barack Obama?

04:47.000 --> 04:50.000
my first joint came out, like,
four years ago. You know that?

04:50.000 --> 04:52.000
For what?
For president.

04:50.000 --> 04:52.000
I know, seems like 40,
doesn't it?

04:52.000 --> 04:53.000
President of what?

04:52.000 --> 04:54.000
Now, the new CD drops
next week, right?

04:53.000 --> 04:54.000
You don't know
there's a black man

04:54.000 --> 04:57.000
running for president
named Barack Obama?

04:54.000 --> 04:56.000
No doubt, no doubt.
The CD is crazy.

04:57.000 --> 04:59.000
His name is Barack?
For real?

04:57.000 --> 05:00.000
It's on fire. It's got
something for everybody.

04:57.000 --> 05:00.000
It's the greatest junior/senior
kickball team ever assembled.

04:59.000 --> 05:00.000
Barack Obama, yes.

05:00.000 --> 05:02.000
Get the fuck out of here.
Barack?

05:00.000 --> 05:03.000
It's got joints for the streets,
it's got joints for the ladies,

05:00.000 --> 05:02.000
Tell me you don't want
to be part of kickball history.

05:02.000 --> 05:04.000
Yes, Barack.
Where's he from, Africa?

05:03.000 --> 05:05.000
it's got joints for the ladies
in the streets.

05:03.000 --> 05:05.000
I don't want to be a part
of kickball history.

05:04.000 --> 05:05.000
His dad was African,
yes.

05:05.000 --> 05:07.000
You can't be serious, man.

05:05.000 --> 05:07.000
The CD is called, Mo' Bitches, Mo' Problems,

05:05.000 --> 05:07.000
I'm not making a request.
I'm prepared to blackmail you

05:07.000 --> 05:09.000
There ain't no nigga running for
president named Barack Obama!

05:07.000 --> 05:09.000
you know what I'm saying,
so go cop that.

05:07.000 --> 05:10.000
with a picture of you wearing
Kanye West Venetian sunglasses,

05:09.000 --> 05:11.000
Shout out to B.I.G.
Real hip-hop, you feel me.

05:10.000 --> 05:14.000
nut-hugger jeans
and Louis Vuitton driving shoes.

05:11.000 --> 05:12.000
No fucking way, man.
No fucking way.

05:11.000 --> 05:14.000
B.I.G.? Whoo,
talk about old school.

05:12.000 --> 05:14.000
I don't believe you.
Stop fucking with me.

05:14.000 --> 05:17.000
If he wins, I think
it will literally be

05:14.000 --> 05:16.000
All right, so,
Thugnificent,

05:14.000 --> 05:15.000
That's Photoshopped.

05:15.000 --> 05:17.000
Explain that to media takeout.

05:16.000 --> 05:17.000
who you feeling
in the game right now?

05:17.000 --> 05:19.000
the best day
of my life.

05:17.000 --> 05:19.000
What are you banging
in your trunk right now?

05:17.000 --> 05:18.000
I'll risk it.

05:18.000 --> 05:19.000
WUNCLER:
All right, Huey.

05:19.000 --> 05:21.000
Okay, okay. You know,
I'm definitely feeling

05:19.000 --> 05:21.000
I'm not a fan of the truth,

05:21.000 --> 05:22.000
NARRATOR: Tom and Sarah Dubois

05:21.000 --> 05:22.000
a lot of cats right now.

05:21.000 --> 05:22.000
but here it is:

05:22.000 --> 05:24.000
are also neighbors of the Freemans.

05:22.000 --> 05:24.000
I'm feeling my main man,
uh, Young Cow Tipper,

05:22.000 --> 05:23.000
the Chinese are calling in
some debts

05:24.000 --> 05:26.000
They both work on the Obama campaign.

05:24.000 --> 05:25.000
Joc Daddy Pimp,
Lil' Hob Nobba,

05:24.000 --> 05:26.000
and I had to bet everything
on this game.

05:25.000 --> 05:27.000
Goo Goo da Bone Mouf.
Little Rich.

05:26.000 --> 05:29.000
Barack has already changed
our lives in so many ways.

05:26.000 --> 05:29.000
My banks, your home,
everything.

05:27.000 --> 05:29.000
Ezbot and Rose, I'm feeling
Willie Whistle Work C, uh,

05:29.000 --> 05:31.000
NARRATOR:
How?

05:29.000 --> 05:31.000
my main man,
Trick Money Smitty.

05:29.000 --> 05:31.000
You think I'm bad,
just wait until the Chinese

05:31.000 --> 05:32.000
Well, I mean,
it's no secret

05:31.000 --> 05:33.000
Lil Phanta,
putting in his work.

05:31.000 --> 05:33.000
take away all the freedoms
you enjoy.

05:32.000 --> 05:34.000
that me and Tom have had
some problems in the past

05:33.000 --> 05:34.000
Look out for his
mix tape.

05:33.000 --> 05:35.000
Freedom to complain.

05:34.000 --> 05:35.000
with our relationship.

05:34.000 --> 05:36.000
Pew Boi Pimp,
Nasty Murda Trae, Epis Green,

05:35.000 --> 05:38.000
Well, it's not like
the whole world knew.

05:35.000 --> 05:38.000
Freedom to have as many
offspring and assault rifles

05:36.000 --> 05:37.000
Lil' Big Dolla,
Snowbunny Sampson.

05:37.000 --> 05:39.000
Um, I'm feeling
a lot of cats right now.

05:38.000 --> 05:39.000
But I think ever since

05:38.000 --> 05:39.000
as you like.

05:39.000 --> 05:41.000
we started working
together for Barack...

05:39.000 --> 05:40.000
Lot of people doing
they thing.

05:39.000 --> 05:41.000
The freedom
to surf the Internet

05:40.000 --> 05:43.000
Ha-ha. Now what about
Sergeant Gutta?

05:41.000 --> 05:43.000
Things are
totally different now.

05:41.000 --> 05:43.000
for pornography
of your choice.

05:43.000 --> 05:46.000
Much better. And it's all thanks
to Barack.

05:43.000 --> 05:45.000
THUGNIFICENT:
Man...

05:43.000 --> 05:47.000
Not the porn.
I'll risk it.

05:45.000 --> 05:47.000
Fuck Sergeant Gutta!

05:46.000 --> 05:48.000
He is such a wonderful,
wonderful man.

05:47.000 --> 05:48.000
That nigga can
eat a dick!

05:47.000 --> 05:49.000
No yacht for you.

05:48.000 --> 05:50.000
I just think it's about time
we had a president

05:50.000 --> 05:53.000
who was smart and tall and
charming and strong and fit.

05:51.000 --> 05:53.000
Hold on, hold on, everyone
quiet down, quiet down!

05:53.000 --> 05:55.000
Just like your hubby?

05:53.000 --> 05:55.000
Wow. I just want to make sure
I heard you correctly.

05:55.000 --> 05:56.000
I said fuck that nigga!

05:56.000 --> 05:58.000
This isn't about you,
sweetie.

05:56.000 --> 05:58.000
I ain't-- I ain't really
the type of nigga to be,

05:58.000 --> 06:01.000
NARRATOR: It is always obvious

05:58.000 --> 06:01.000
when a couple hasn't engaged

05:58.000 --> 06:00.000
you know, all on the radio,
running his mouth,

06:00.000 --> 06:02.000
starting beef and all that,
you know what I'm saying.

06:01.000 --> 06:04.000
in normal marital relations for some time.

06:02.000 --> 06:04.000
But I'm just saying, that shit
sound like some bullshit!

06:03.000 --> 06:06.000
You are the one
who quit the game.

06:04.000 --> 06:06.000
Obama, of course, is as polarizing

06:04.000 --> 06:06.000
And that retarded dance, man.

06:06.000 --> 06:08.000
as he is transformative.

06:06.000 --> 06:09.000
See, that's what you get
when you let 13-year-olds rap.

06:06.000 --> 06:08.000
You must have me mistaken
for somebody else.

06:08.000 --> 06:11.000
Some have accused Obama of being a socialist.

06:09.000 --> 06:11.000
How-- How old--
How old is that nigga?

06:09.000 --> 06:11.000
You were a great player.
Why did you quit?

06:11.000 --> 06:13.000
Others believe that he's a Muslim.

06:11.000 --> 06:12.000
That nigga 15 years old,
dawg.

06:11.000 --> 06:14.000
Why will you not play in the
Harmonious Kickball Tournament?

06:12.000 --> 06:14.000
Yo, well, he sound like
he 15 months old.

06:13.000 --> 06:17.000
Some have gone as far as to label him the Antichrist.

06:14.000 --> 06:16.000
That nigga sound like he
got a nipple in his mouth.

06:14.000 --> 06:15.000
What's it matter to you?

06:15.000 --> 06:17.000
My name is Ming.

06:16.000 --> 06:18.000
Hey, Sergeant Gutta,
I got an idea.

06:17.000 --> 06:19.000
He is the socialist Muslim
Antichrist.

06:17.000 --> 06:20.000
I am captain of the Wushung
Harmonious Junior/Senior

06:18.000 --> 06:20.000
Why don't you take
your momma's motherfucking titty

06:19.000 --> 06:21.000
This is Uncle Ruckus.

06:20.000 --> 06:22.000
out your mouth
so you can rap, nigga.

06:20.000 --> 06:21.000
kickball team.

06:21.000 --> 06:22.000
He's an Uncle Tom.

06:21.000 --> 06:22.000
Even before I was born,

06:22.000 --> 06:25.000
Perhaps the biggest Uncle Tom to have ever lived.

06:22.000 --> 06:26.000
it was decided I would be a champion kickball player.

06:25.000 --> 06:29.000
If this nigga gets elected,
America is over. Over.

06:26.000 --> 06:29.000
RILEY: Thugnificent's CD dropped

06:26.000 --> 06:29.000
the next week.

06:26.000 --> 06:29.000
At 3 years old I was taken to the National Kickball

06:29.000 --> 06:30.000
You want this nigga to shit

06:29.000 --> 06:32.000
SoundScan say he ain't sold shit.

06:29.000 --> 06:33.000
Training Center outside of Beijing.

06:30.000 --> 06:32.000
in the same place
William Taft shat?

06:32.000 --> 06:35.000
And his big wife, she don't need
to be in the White House.

06:32.000 --> 06:35.000
Thugnificent was all fucked up.

06:33.000 --> 06:37.000
I trained every day and every night to be the best.

06:35.000 --> 06:38.000
She should be in the WNBA
shooting foul shots.

06:37.000 --> 06:40.000
My grandfather says to control the ball,

06:40.000 --> 06:42.000
I must control myself.

06:42.000 --> 06:45.000
Ah. You want my brick,
you gonna have to pry it

06:42.000 --> 06:45.000
But just me and the ball alone
is no kickball.

06:43.000 --> 06:46.000
Yo, it's Thugnificent. You know what, matter of fact,

06:45.000 --> 06:49.000
from my cold dead hands,
Mr. Obama Hussein.

06:45.000 --> 06:47.000
Without a worthy opponent,
I nothing.

06:46.000 --> 06:47.000
it ain't Thugnificent. You know why?

06:47.000 --> 06:49.000
We must have
the ultimate contest

06:48.000 --> 06:50.000
Because I ain't feeling too Thugnificent right now.

06:49.000 --> 06:51.000
to settle once and for all
who is the best.

06:50.000 --> 06:52.000
This Otis. That's right,
you all niggas getting

06:51.000 --> 06:52.000
Nigga down!

06:52.000 --> 06:55.000
NARRATOR:
What is wrong with letting

06:52.000 --> 06:55.000
people be happy?

06:52.000 --> 06:54.000
the government name.
It's Otis Jenkins.

06:52.000 --> 06:56.000
Like I said, you have me
mistaken for somebody else.

06:54.000 --> 06:56.000
And I gotta holler
at y'all real quick

06:55.000 --> 06:58.000
Can too much hope
possibly be a bad thing?

06:56.000 --> 06:58.000
about why y'all ain't coming out
to support your boy.

06:58.000 --> 07:02.000
Hope is irrational.

06:58.000 --> 06:59.000
Y'all ain't supporting
Thugnificent

06:59.000 --> 07:01.000
and I think
that's real fucked up.

07:01.000 --> 07:02.000
All y'all niggas
can eat a dick.

07:02.000 --> 07:04.000
In Bavaria, we have a saying:

07:03.000 --> 07:04.000
All y'all motherfuckers
on my friends list.

07:04.000 --> 07:06.000
I'm talking about Facebook
niggas as well as MySpace.

07:06.000 --> 07:09.000
If y'all ain't buying the CD,
don't holler at me online,

07:07.000 --> 07:11.000
It means, "This is the most depressing fucking kid

07:09.000 --> 07:11.000
no friend requests, nothing.
Y'all send me stupid

07:11.000 --> 07:12.000
fucking messages all day,

07:12.000 --> 07:14.000
I've ever met in my life."

07:12.000 --> 07:14.000
but won't pay
for my damn song?

07:14.000 --> 07:17.000
I hate y'all niggas, man.
"Hey, hey, Thugnificent,

07:15.000 --> 07:18.000
I sit down once again with Thugnificent,

07:17.000 --> 07:18.000
"Is it 'booty butt cheeks'

07:18.000 --> 07:21.000
who appears to have undergone a political awakening

07:18.000 --> 07:19.000
or is it
'move them butt cheeks'?"

07:18.000 --> 07:19.000
I'll play.

07:19.000 --> 07:22.000
Nigga, who gives a fuck?
It's a song about butt cheeks!

07:19.000 --> 07:22.000
But I'm not interested
in your ultimate contest.

07:21.000 --> 07:23.000
since our last conversation.

07:22.000 --> 07:24.000
THUGNIFICENT:
Well, why ain't I getting

07:22.000 --> 07:24.000
no spins?

07:22.000 --> 07:23.000
It's just a simple game
of kickball.

07:23.000 --> 07:25.000
So you know
who Obama is now?

07:24.000 --> 07:27.000
No, no, no, it's your job
to make sure it gets played

07:25.000 --> 07:26.000
Oh, no, I knew
who the nigga was.

07:26.000 --> 07:28.000
I was just joking.
You were not joking.

07:26.000 --> 07:29.000
So you decided to come fight
for freedom?

07:27.000 --> 07:30.000
on the radio, not--
Say what? You wanna drop me?

07:28.000 --> 07:31.000
You jumped on the Obama
celebrity bandwagon

07:29.000 --> 07:31.000
Well, you made
the right choice.

07:30.000 --> 07:33.000
You wanna drop Thugnifi--
Hello?

07:31.000 --> 07:33.000
because it will give you
much needed exposure.

07:31.000 --> 07:32.000
All right, bring it in.

07:32.000 --> 07:33.000
A few minutes ago,

07:33.000 --> 07:35.000
No, see. It ain't even got
nothing to do with that.

07:33.000 --> 07:36.000
in a gross violation
of my civil liberties,

07:34.000 --> 07:39.000
Damn, damn, damn!

07:35.000 --> 07:36.000
You know what I'm saying?

07:36.000 --> 07:39.000
I started looking into his
political positions and his--

07:36.000 --> 07:39.000
the INS repossessed
the five Dominican players

07:39.000 --> 07:40.000
And his policies
and views and whatnot.

07:39.000 --> 07:40.000
Everything okay?

07:39.000 --> 07:41.000
from the junior squad
of the Woodcrest Harmonious

07:40.000 --> 07:42.000
What policies?
I heard the nigga speak,

07:40.000 --> 07:42.000
Huh? Oh, oh, yeah, yeah,
little man.

07:41.000 --> 07:43.000
kickball team.

07:42.000 --> 07:44.000
and he was talking
about changing some shit

07:42.000 --> 07:45.000
Everything's cool. Um, just time
to make some bigger moves.

07:43.000 --> 07:46.000
We must immediately find a
replacement for these players.

07:44.000 --> 07:46.000
or hoping for some shit,
and I thought: "Yeah."

07:45.000 --> 07:47.000
You know what I'm saying?
That's all.

07:46.000 --> 07:48.000
I mean, all the nigga's
asking for is hope.

07:46.000 --> 07:49.000
I'm now exploring the
possibility of child soldiers

07:48.000 --> 07:49.000
You can sit on your ass
all day and hope.

07:49.000 --> 07:52.000
If you too lazy to hope
you a lazy motherfucker,

07:49.000 --> 07:50.000
Hey, what's up, y'all?

07:49.000 --> 07:52.000
from Sierra Leone,
but they may not get here in--

07:52.000 --> 07:53.000
that's all I know.

07:52.000 --> 07:53.000
Hey, man.
I got a surprise for you.

07:52.000 --> 07:54.000
Huh?

07:53.000 --> 07:54.000
I'm voting for Obama

07:53.000 --> 07:55.000
I've seen that video
you put on your MySpace.

07:54.000 --> 07:56.000
because he's gonna
lower my taxes.

07:54.000 --> 07:56.000
Say again? Affirmative,
we're on our way.

07:55.000 --> 07:58.000
You know, how they don't be
buying your CD and stuff, right?

07:56.000 --> 07:58.000
NARRATOR:
Actually, he has promised

07:56.000 --> 07:59.000
Come on, guys, that's us.
Moving out! Moving out!

07:58.000 --> 07:59.000
to raise taxes
at your income level.

07:58.000 --> 08:00.000
Well, here.
I got 'em today after work.

07:59.000 --> 08:00.000
Huh?

08:00.000 --> 08:04.000
And he's just
really, really fit...

08:00.000 --> 08:02.000
I spent my whole check,
but I want you to know

08:01.000 --> 08:03.000
What's going on?
Sorry, Mr. Wuncler.

08:02.000 --> 08:04.000
I support you, man.

08:03.000 --> 08:06.000
POW rescue in Afghanistan.
Wait! Wait!

08:04.000 --> 08:06.000
to lead.
And also body fit too.

08:04.000 --> 08:06.000
See, that-- Look at 'em!
What the fuck do I need

08:06.000 --> 08:07.000
Well, I also support Obama

08:06.000 --> 08:09.000
several copies
of my own CD for, Leonard!

08:06.000 --> 08:08.000
Goddamn it! Fuck the POW.

08:08.000 --> 08:10.000
because he's against
corporate bailouts.

08:08.000 --> 08:11.000
You are staying here
and playing kickball.

08:09.000 --> 08:11.000
Come on, man,
we can't afford for you

08:10.000 --> 08:11.000
That is also not true.
Huh?

08:11.000 --> 08:16.000
I'm supporting Obama
because he black.

08:11.000 --> 08:12.000
just to be throwing
money away!

08:12.000 --> 08:13.000
I didn't throw it away.

08:13.000 --> 08:15.000
I-I bought the--
You didn't--

08:14.000 --> 08:15.000
Well, team captain,

08:15.000 --> 08:17.000
And that reminds me, man.

08:15.000 --> 08:18.000
you've got two days
to assemble a new team.

08:16.000 --> 08:19.000
And he's gonna get the troops
out of Afghanistan, right?

08:17.000 --> 08:18.000
I don't know
what we gonna do,

08:18.000 --> 08:19.000
but I don't think
I can keep supporting us

08:18.000 --> 08:20.000
Team captain?

08:19.000 --> 08:20.000
Also wrong.

08:19.000 --> 08:22.000
off my Wendy's checks.
Oh, here we go.

08:20.000 --> 08:22.000
Then what the fuck
that nigga gonna do?

08:20.000 --> 08:21.000
GRANDDAD:
Yep, new team, no problem,

08:20.000 --> 08:21.000
Mr. Wuncler.

08:21.000 --> 08:23.000
We're on it.

08:22.000 --> 08:24.000
We all need to, you know,
do some shit sometimes.

08:22.000 --> 08:23.000
What you trying to say,
Leonard? Huh?

08:23.000 --> 08:25.000
How long did I carry you, nigga?

08:24.000 --> 08:26.000
You know what I'm saying?
Some shit needs to get done.

08:25.000 --> 08:27.000
How long did I pay the bills
in this motherfucker

08:26.000 --> 08:29.000
And until we do that shit,
shit ain't gonna change.

08:27.000 --> 08:29.000
that you living in?
See how niggas forget?

08:29.000 --> 08:32.000
So I thought to myself,
"Let's do this shit."

08:29.000 --> 08:30.000
You see? You see
how niggas forget?

08:29.000 --> 08:30.000
Who the fuck are you?

08:30.000 --> 08:33.000
No, no, Thugnificent,
it's that I only make, like,

08:30.000 --> 08:32.000
I am Jigme.
I come from Tibet.

08:32.000 --> 08:33.000
And that's when will.i.am
called me

08:32.000 --> 08:35.000
I want to defeat the Chinese
oppressors in kickball.

08:33.000 --> 08:35.000
about doing this damn song.

08:33.000 --> 08:35.000
7.50 a hour and the mortgage
on this place is, like,

08:35.000 --> 08:36.000
NARRATOR: Thugnificent joins

08:35.000 --> 08:37.000
12,000 a month.

08:35.000 --> 08:37.000
Why?
I hate fucking Chinese.

08:36.000 --> 08:40.000
will.i.am's all-star celebrity tribute to Barack Obama.

08:37.000 --> 08:39.000
So I did the math
and that means I'd have to work,

08:39.000 --> 08:42.000
like, 82 hours a day.
So I went in,

08:39.000 --> 08:41.000
I'd like a word with you
in private.

08:40.000 --> 08:44.000
Things weren't working right

08:42.000 --> 08:44.000
asked the manager
for some overtime and he said:

08:42.000 --> 08:45.000
This team is pathetic.

08:44.000 --> 08:48.000
I said, I wanna fight

08:44.000 --> 08:47.000
"He couldn't do it 'cause it's

08:44.000 --> 08:47.000
against company policy.

08:45.000 --> 08:47.000
They don't stand a chance
against the Chinese.

08:47.000 --> 08:49.000
"You just started here.
Who you think you are?

08:47.000 --> 08:50.000
Not one single
goddamn shot in hell.

08:48.000 --> 08:52.000
And said, yes, we can

08:49.000 --> 08:50.000
"Be lucky with the hours
that you get.

08:50.000 --> 08:52.000
Cindy's pregnant
and she has to work."

08:50.000 --> 08:53.000
It'll be an embarrassment
they'll never, ever live down

08:52.000 --> 08:54.000
I want to ride your nuts

08:52.000 --> 08:55.000
I was like, "but Cindy--"

08:52.000 --> 08:55.000
I figure maybe I could work

08:53.000 --> 08:57.000
for the rest of their miserable
lives until they die.

08:54.000 --> 08:56.000
You're the man

08:55.000 --> 08:56.000
two jobs at the same time.

08:56.000 --> 09:00.000
Maybe I could be on the phone
doing some telemarketing,

08:57.000 --> 09:00.000
You know what one of these balls
can do to a human body?

09:00.000 --> 09:02.000
and work on, like,
some art and sell art

09:00.000 --> 09:03.000
They'll get torn to pieces.
Ripped to shreds.

09:02.000 --> 09:04.000
out of the back of Wendy's.
Oh, man! Why me?

09:03.000 --> 09:06.000
Some may even lose control
of their bowels.

09:04.000 --> 09:06.000
WILL.I.AM:

09:04.000 --> 09:06.000
I did everything
I was supposed to do.

09:06.000 --> 09:08.000
THUGNIFICENT:

09:06.000 --> 09:08.000
I used that stupid
fucking Auto-Tuner on my voice,

09:06.000 --> 09:09.000
By the third inning
they'll be pissing and shitting

09:08.000 --> 09:13.000
Riding, riding

09:08.000 --> 09:09.000
I instigated a rap beef.

09:09.000 --> 09:11.000
And I even tried
to make a dance, nigga.

09:09.000 --> 09:12.000
on themselves right in front
of their friends and loved ones.

09:11.000 --> 09:13.000
Nothing seems to work.
Um...

09:12.000 --> 09:14.000
It's gonna be flat-out
fucking terrible.

09:13.000 --> 09:15.000
Thugnificent?
This might be a bad time,

09:14.000 --> 09:16.000
We must find
some better athletes.

09:15.000 --> 09:19.000
but Sergeant Gutta just posted
a response to you on YouTube.

09:16.000 --> 09:18.000
This is what you got.

09:17.000 --> 09:20.000
Dick-riding for the gay

09:19.000 --> 09:20.000
Hey, dawg. First off I wanna say

09:20.000 --> 09:24.000
Dick-riding for Iraq

09:20.000 --> 09:23.000
that I'm a huge fan of Thugnificent.

09:23.000 --> 09:24.000
I grew up listening to Thugnificent.

09:24.000 --> 09:26.000
To ride that dick

09:24.000 --> 09:26.000
Matter of fact, I'd even go ahead,

09:24.000 --> 09:28.000
I want to say a few words
to everybody here

09:26.000 --> 09:28.000
As it's Barack's

09:26.000 --> 09:28.000
as far to say that I love this nigga, no homo.

09:28.000 --> 09:30.000
Dick-riding

09:28.000 --> 09:29.000
He is one of the real niggas

09:28.000 --> 09:30.000
about victory.

09:29.000 --> 09:31.000
that made me wanna do this shit.

09:30.000 --> 09:34.000
Unfortunately there's absolutely
no time to train you people.

09:31.000 --> 09:33.000
NARRATOR: It is finally election night.

09:31.000 --> 09:33.000
But fuck this old-ass nigga, man!

09:33.000 --> 09:35.000
Robert Freeman is throwing a party.

09:34.000 --> 09:38.000
But I have bought each of you
a brand-new pair of sneakers.

09:35.000 --> 09:38.000
Well, it's been
a long, black struggle.

09:35.000 --> 09:36.000
This old nigga is old enough to be my dad

09:37.000 --> 09:38.000
and he telling me to eat a dick?

09:38.000 --> 09:40.000
And I felt me and Barack
deserved a party.

09:38.000 --> 09:40.000
Nigga, what's wrong with you?

09:38.000 --> 09:40.000
These shoes were handmade

09:40.000 --> 09:43.000
NARRATOR: All around I see black faces

09:40.000 --> 09:43.000
beaming with elation.

09:40.000 --> 09:42.000
You a grown-ass man and you telling a 15-year-old

09:40.000 --> 09:44.000
with the youngest Chinese
sweatshop labor we could find.

09:43.000 --> 09:45.000
Yeah, man, I'm gonna be
the next black president.

09:43.000 --> 09:44.000
to eat a dick? I know your mother

09:44.000 --> 09:47.000
raised you better than that, dawg. Matter of fact...

09:44.000 --> 09:45.000
Wear them with pride.

09:45.000 --> 09:49.000
NARRATOR: It is as though each of them

09:45.000 --> 09:49.000
has been elected president.

09:45.000 --> 09:48.000
I'm gonna be like, "Take this,
you yellow rat bastard."

09:49.000 --> 09:50.000
Excuse me, is this Miss Jenkins?

09:49.000 --> 09:51.000
Motherfucker!

09:50.000 --> 09:53.000
WOMAN:  Yes, it is.  My name is Sergeant Gutta.

09:51.000 --> 09:53.000
Almost each of them.

09:51.000 --> 09:55.000
Greetings, friends.
Forgive our intrusion.

09:53.000 --> 09:54.000
And I don't know if you aware,

09:54.000 --> 09:56.000
but your son said some very rude things

09:55.000 --> 09:56.000
What's wrong with you?

09:55.000 --> 09:58.000
We came to wish you luck
in tomorrow's game.

09:56.000 --> 09:58.000
I thought you'd be
dancing on your tail

09:56.000 --> 09:58.000
about me on the radio. Yes, I know.

09:58.000 --> 10:00.000
with the rest of the circus
chimps. Look at them.

09:58.000 --> 10:00.000
He said some very rude things. He's too old

09:58.000 --> 10:02.000
I look forward
to an unforgettable contest.

10:00.000 --> 10:02.000
Just as happy
as a pig in shit.

10:00.000 --> 10:02.000
to be acting like that, and I know I don't like him

10:02.000 --> 10:03.000
Can't they see?

10:02.000 --> 10:04.000
using that language either.

10:03.000 --> 10:05.000
Can't they see
what this nigga's gonna do

10:04.000 --> 10:06.000
You know, I one time--  That was your momma, nigga.

10:04.000 --> 10:06.000
Give them
their ball back.

10:05.000 --> 10:06.000
to our great country?

10:06.000 --> 10:08.000
Your momma.

10:07.000 --> 10:09.000
Looks like we the only
two people with sense

10:08.000 --> 10:09.000
Grow your old ass up, nigga.

10:09.000 --> 10:10.000
in this whole room.

10:09.000 --> 10:11.000
I hope you go broke, you feel me?

10:10.000 --> 10:12.000
Just you and me.
Just you and me.

10:10.000 --> 10:11.000
GRANDDAD:
Damn.

10:11.000 --> 10:13.000
I hope that the IRS is on they way over

10:12.000 --> 10:14.000
GRANDDAD:
Ruckus, shut up

10:12.000 --> 10:14.000
and get back to work.

10:13.000 --> 10:15.000
right now to take your shit, nigga.

10:14.000 --> 10:15.000
And grab some more champagne.

10:15.000 --> 10:17.000
See? Niggas already
getting uppity.

10:17.000 --> 10:20.000
So I'm thinking
that this gonna be my new look.

10:20.000 --> 10:21.000
Oh. That's a way to go.

10:20.000 --> 10:24.000
I believe, this is the gentleman
you're looking for.

10:21.000 --> 10:23.000
I mean, I feel like
it's more grown-up.

10:22.000 --> 10:24.000
: Welcome, sports fans,

10:23.000 --> 10:25.000
Like, having
tighter clothes

10:24.000 --> 10:25.000
MAN:
Otis Jenkins?

10:24.000 --> 10:27.000
to the 43rd biannual Wushung/Woodcrest Junior/Senior

10:25.000 --> 10:26.000
is gonna make people
take me more seriously.

10:25.000 --> 10:27.000
We're from the
Internal Revenue Service.

10:26.000 --> 10:30.000
It's really gonna happen.
It's all gonna be better now.

10:27.000 --> 10:29.000
Toodles!

10:27.000 --> 10:29.000
Harmonious Kickball Tournament.

10:29.000 --> 10:32.000
Both teams on the field and already there seems to be

10:30.000 --> 10:32.000
It's all gonna be better.
Right, honey?

10:30.000 --> 10:33.000
THUGNIFICENT:
Damn! Damn! Damn!

10:32.000 --> 10:34.000
Tom, I'm trying
to watch this.

10:32.000 --> 10:33.000
some type of trouble.

10:33.000 --> 10:35.000
Seems like the owner of the Wushung team

10:34.000 --> 10:36.000
Yo, yo, yo, I heard
the presidential limo

10:35.000 --> 10:37.000
is accusing one of the Woodcrest players

10:36.000 --> 10:39.000
is gonna be like a crazy
pimped out Cadillac now,

10:37.000 --> 10:39.000
of being a ringer. The rules say

10:39.000 --> 10:42.000
with rims and, like,
machine guns and lasers.

10:39.000 --> 10:42.000
any player must be a resident of Wushung or Woodcrest.

10:42.000 --> 10:43.000
Excuse me.

10:42.000 --> 10:44.000
He is absolutely
a resident.

10:43.000 --> 10:45.000
I'd like to propose
a toast.

10:44.000 --> 10:49.000
Here is his hot Caucasian wife
and half-Asian baby.

10:45.000 --> 10:46.000
Now I'd just
like to say

10:47.000 --> 10:49.000
that today is a very
special day for me.

10:49.000 --> 10:52.000
I hope you all are enjoying
the cheese, wine

10:49.000 --> 10:52.000
ANNOUNCER: And now the Woodcrest team

10:49.000 --> 10:52.000
is making a complaint.

10:52.000 --> 10:55.000
Looks like the Wushung team has one too many adult members.

10:53.000 --> 10:57.000
and freedom I have struggled
so hard to provide tonight.

10:55.000 --> 10:58.000
Everybody knows Junior/Senior Tournament rules

10:57.000 --> 10:59.000
And because of my pain
and suffering,

10:58.000 --> 11:00.000
say the roster must have an equal number

10:59.000 --> 11:02.000
the black struggle
is officially over.

11:00.000 --> 11:01.000
of kids and adults.

11:01.000 --> 11:05.000
Dolo is strong and healthy
like many kids in China,

11:02.000 --> 11:03.000
No longer can they
keep us down.

11:04.000 --> 11:05.000
No longer can we
be silenced--

11:04.000 --> 11:06.000
How much you owe?
Man, them motherfuckers

11:05.000 --> 11:09.000
but I assure you he is only
12 years old.

11:06.000 --> 11:07.000
Shh! This is it!
Shut up! Shut up!

11:06.000 --> 11:08.000
want me to pay a 121,000
in the next six weeks

11:07.000 --> 11:09.000
And now we have the returns

11:08.000 --> 11:09.000
or they gonna take my house.

11:09.000 --> 11:11.000
from the West Coast coming in here.

11:09.000 --> 11:11.000
Look, I told you
what you need to do.

11:09.000 --> 11:12.000
Here is the official keeper
of government records

11:11.000 --> 11:14.000
Okay. And so yes, folks, we are calling it.

11:11.000 --> 11:13.000
I know, man,
but I'm saying, a job?

11:12.000 --> 11:15.000
to verify that fact.

11:13.000 --> 11:15.000
I mean, wasn't that the point
of us being rappers,

11:14.000 --> 11:16.000
Barack Hussein Obama will be

11:15.000 --> 11:17.000
so we wouldn't have
to get a job? Look, man.

11:15.000 --> 11:17.000
ANNOUNCER: Heh! Looks like the ref

11:16.000 --> 11:18.000
the next President of the United States.

11:17.000 --> 11:18.000
You shouldn't have given up
so easily.

11:18.000 --> 11:20.000
MAN: Yes!

11:18.000 --> 11:21.000
is gonna let it slide. Tough break for the home team.

11:19.000 --> 11:20.000
If you and Mack
were still here--

11:20.000 --> 11:21.000
Obama! Obama!

11:20.000 --> 11:21.000
Otis, it's over.

11:21.000 --> 11:23.000
Obama!
Yeah, Obama!

11:21.000 --> 11:23.000
We were lucky, man.

11:21.000 --> 11:23.000
Play kickball.

11:23.000 --> 11:28.000
For the first time in my life,
I am proud to be an American.

11:23.000 --> 11:25.000
We had a great time,
we got to be rock stars,

11:24.000 --> 11:26.000
ANNOUNCER: Huey Freeman on the mound.

11:25.000 --> 11:27.000
and see some shit that most
people never get to see.

11:26.000 --> 11:28.000
There is a lot of excitement about this young man's return

11:27.000 --> 11:29.000
But it's over.
You got a degree, nigga.

11:28.000 --> 11:29.000
Yeah!

11:29.000 --> 11:31.000
You got options.
That's more than most people.

11:29.000 --> 11:30.000
to the sport of kickball.

11:30.000 --> 11:32.000
Little Ming Do steps up to the plate.

11:31.000 --> 11:32.000
Why, Lord?

11:32.000 --> 11:34.000
ALL:
Obama! Obama!

11:32.000 --> 11:35.000
What a treat to see these two titans of the game

11:34.000 --> 11:35.000
Obama!

11:35.000 --> 11:36.000
I can get you
in the door, man.

11:35.000 --> 11:36.000
face off against one another.

11:36.000 --> 11:39.000
Think about it.

11:36.000 --> 11:38.000
Let's go, Huey!

11:37.000 --> 11:38.000
Obama.

11:38.000 --> 11:40.000
Show them what's good,
Huey!

11:41.000 --> 11:44.000
MAN:
Okay, Mr. Otis Jenkins.

11:43.000 --> 11:45.000
ANNOUNCER: Huey looks absolutely

11:43.000 --> 11:45.000
determined out there folks--

11:44.000 --> 11:47.000
Says here you have a bachelor's
degree in communications.

11:45.000 --> 11:47.000
Oh! Hello! And goodbye!

11:47.000 --> 11:49.000
Yeah, but, uh, I don't normally
go by my government name.

11:47.000 --> 11:51.000
And that one is out of here. Not a good start for Freeman.

11:49.000 --> 11:50.000
So you can just call me
Thugnificent.

11:50.000 --> 11:52.000
I can call you
Thugnificent?

11:51.000 --> 11:52.000
You suck, Huey!

11:52.000 --> 11:55.000
You've never heard my music? I
thought Flo would've told you.

11:52.000 --> 11:54.000
You worthless
motherfucker.

11:54.000 --> 11:56.000
ANNOUNCER: Next kicker is Lily Chang,

11:55.000 --> 11:57.000
NARRATOR: It is days before inauguration,

11:55.000 --> 11:56.000
We were in
the Lethal Interjection Crew.

11:56.000 --> 11:59.000
By "Flo",
you mean Derrick?

11:56.000 --> 11:59.000
a 73-year-old retired farm worker with diabetes.

11:57.000 --> 12:00.000
and Obama Mania is at a fever pitch.

11:59.000 --> 12:00.000
No, he didn't
mention that.

11:59.000 --> 12:01.000
Folks, she's experiencing complete kidney failure.

12:00.000 --> 12:04.000
I return to Woodcrest to check on the Freemans.

12:00.000 --> 12:02.000
Rappers, you say?
Oh, yeah.

12:01.000 --> 12:02.000
Hasn't peed in three years.

12:02.000 --> 12:04.000
We did a song called
"Fuck Granddad", uh,

12:02.000 --> 12:05.000
This might just be the warm-up that Freeman needs.

12:04.000 --> 12:07.000
I don't necessarily think
of myself as a hero.

12:04.000 --> 12:05.000
about fucking up
old people.

12:05.000 --> 12:07.000
Did a song called
"Stomp 'Em in the Nuts",

12:05.000 --> 12:07.000
And here's the pitch.

12:07.000 --> 12:10.000
And when people always
ask me if I want a medal

12:07.000 --> 12:09.000
which was, ironically, about
stomping niggas in the nuts.

12:09.000 --> 12:13.000
You know, real shit.

12:10.000 --> 12:12.000
or a monument or a statue
in my honor, I say,

12:12.000 --> 12:14.000
"No, mm-mm. Mm-mm."

12:12.000 --> 12:14.000
ANNOUNCER: Oh, mother!

12:13.000 --> 12:15.000
Derrick neglected
to mention this on his resume.

12:14.000 --> 12:15.000
All I want to do
is be there in person,

12:15.000 --> 12:17.000
on that glorious day,

12:15.000 --> 12:17.000
Yeah, music is in our blood,
man, that's what we do.

12:17.000 --> 12:19.000
when the first black president
take the oath.

12:17.000 --> 12:19.000
You know, we just
in a transitional period

12:17.000 --> 12:18.000
What the hell
do you call this?

12:18.000 --> 12:21.000
I'm trying, all right?
Get your shit together.

12:19.000 --> 12:21.000
I just want to stand in the
crowd, somewhere in the front,

12:19.000 --> 12:21.000
with our career right now,
so, anything we do now

12:21.000 --> 12:24.000
maybe in the VIP section,
maybe next to Beyoncé.

12:21.000 --> 12:23.000
would just be temporary.
Derrick too, I presume?

12:21.000 --> 12:22.000
Kicker up.

12:22.000 --> 12:23.000
ANNOUNCER: Huey's not having the best

12:23.000 --> 12:25.000
Hell, yeah.
Flo is my nigga.

12:23.000 --> 12:25.000
day of his life here today, folks.

12:24.000 --> 12:26.000
Are you aware
that some people are paying

12:25.000 --> 12:26.000
As soon as I'm back on,
he's back on, you know.

12:25.000 --> 12:26.000
Let's see if he can't get it together.

12:26.000 --> 12:30.000
as much as $50,000
for VIP inauguration tickets?

12:26.000 --> 12:29.000
Strike! Throws one and strike.

12:27.000 --> 12:28.000
Pow! We out of here.

12:29.000 --> 12:31.000
Good to know.

12:29.000 --> 12:31.000
And another strike.

12:30.000 --> 12:33.000
Well, I don't think you can put
a price on decades of struggle.

12:31.000 --> 12:34.000
Hey, Flo. Hey, I didn't know
that he didn't know--

12:31.000 --> 12:35.000
Huey Freeman is getting that pitching arm warmed up now,

12:33.000 --> 12:37.000
Did you contribute any money
at all to the Obama campaign?

12:34.000 --> 12:35.000
Flo. Come on, man,
don't be like that.

12:35.000 --> 12:37.000
and that is two back-to-back strikeouts.

12:36.000 --> 12:38.000
Flo. I didn't know, Flo!

12:37.000 --> 12:39.000
I paid 10 bucks
for this T-shirt.

12:38.000 --> 12:39.000
I love you, man.

12:39.000 --> 12:41.000
Did you get that from
the campaign website?

12:40.000 --> 12:41.000
No homo.

12:41.000 --> 12:42.000
No, I got it from the guy
at the car wash,

12:41.000 --> 12:43.000
ANNOUNCER: Dolo steps up to the plate.

12:42.000 --> 12:45.000
but it's still free advertising
when I wear it outside.

12:43.000 --> 12:46.000
And we've been waiting for this matchup all day and--

12:44.000 --> 12:45.000
LEONARD:
Man, I don't know

12:44.000 --> 12:45.000
what we gonna do.

12:45.000 --> 12:47.000
A lot of people
see me in this shirt.

12:45.000 --> 12:48.000
We all knew
it was gonna come to this.

12:46.000 --> 12:48.000
Oh, look at that!

12:47.000 --> 12:48.000
I mean, before
we change the world,

12:48.000 --> 12:49.000
we gotta change
ourselves first.

12:48.000 --> 12:50.000
LEONARD:
Yo, is that what I think it is?

12:48.000 --> 12:50.000
That's gonna leave a mark...

12:49.000 --> 12:51.000
I mean, this is
the new colorless,

12:50.000 --> 12:52.000
You ain't never seen
no yayo?

12:50.000 --> 12:52.000
in his pants.
Damn!

12:51.000 --> 12:52.000
flavorless and unscented era.

12:52.000 --> 12:55.000
Like, from now on, I'm calling
all my niggas "Obamas."

12:52.000 --> 12:54.000
Yes, I'm just trying
to figure out what this is.

12:52.000 --> 12:55.000
Good job, boy. This game is more
important than you.

12:54.000 --> 12:56.000
That's real cocaine, nigga.
Hm. Where'd you get it?

12:55.000 --> 12:57.000
And all my bitches
I'm calling "Michelles."

12:55.000 --> 12:57.000
Someone get him
some Demerol.

12:56.000 --> 13:00.000
Nigga, don't worry about where
I got it. I got my connects.

12:57.000 --> 12:58.000
Think about it.
If you was a bitch, right,

12:57.000 --> 12:58.000
And make sure
it's the good stuff.

12:58.000 --> 13:01.000
would you rather be called
a "bitch" or "Michelle"?

12:58.000 --> 13:00.000
ANNOUNCER: In the kicker's box right now

13:00.000 --> 13:02.000
Ed the Third.
So what are you doing with it?

13:01.000 --> 13:04.000
And what about
bitches named Michelle?

13:01.000 --> 13:02.000
is Huey Freeman, the pride of Woodcrest.

13:02.000 --> 13:03.000
"So what are you doing with it?"

13:02.000 --> 13:04.000
Yeah!

13:03.000 --> 13:05.000
We gonna cook it up,
slang it on them streets,

13:04.000 --> 13:07.000
Man, you making jokes. I'm
trying to uplift my Obamas.

13:04.000 --> 13:06.000
ANNOUNCER: Everyone's cheering.

13:04.000 --> 13:06.000
Here he goes.

13:05.000 --> 13:07.000
and get paid, nigga.
How do we do that?

13:06.000 --> 13:07.000
He locks in and the ball is coming up--

13:07.000 --> 13:09.000
I mean, how hard can it be?

13:07.000 --> 13:09.000
He's got a-- Little bit girly,

13:09.000 --> 13:10.000
I think
there's some rap songs

13:09.000 --> 13:10.000
but it'll get the job done.

13:10.000 --> 13:12.000
that tell you how to do it,
right?

13:11.000 --> 13:13.000
Yes, can you tell
the president-elect

13:12.000 --> 13:14.000
Next up is Riley Freeman.

13:13.000 --> 13:15.000
it's Civil Rights legend
Robert Freeman.

13:14.000 --> 13:16.000
Wait a min--
Hold on, what's this?

13:15.000 --> 13:19.000
F-R-E-E-M-A-N, who struggled
to open the door

13:16.000 --> 13:19.000
Oh, my. His first time at the plate

13:18.000 --> 13:20.000
Okay, he said something
about baking soda.

13:19.000 --> 13:21.000
for him to be president.
You got all that?

13:19.000 --> 13:21.000
and he's calling a home run.

13:20.000 --> 13:23.000
Damn. Man, this shit don't
actually say how to make it.

13:21.000 --> 13:24.000
Right. Just tell him
I'm calling again

13:21.000 --> 13:24.000
And Ming lets go with a fireball.

13:23.000 --> 13:25.000
Oh, what the hell,
let's check Wikipedia.

13:24.000 --> 13:25.000
Riley's got his eye--

13:25.000 --> 13:26.000
about those tickets.
Again.

13:26.000 --> 13:29.000
Hey, man,
I got that Obama water.

13:27.000 --> 13:28.000
Strike!

13:29.000 --> 13:31.000
Change the way
you hydrate, brother.

13:29.000 --> 13:30.000
Strike two!

13:30.000 --> 13:31.000
Strike three!

13:31.000 --> 13:33.000
Yo, little man.
Hey, hey, check it out.

13:31.000 --> 13:32.000
Good grief.

13:33.000 --> 13:35.000
I got commemorative plates,
two for 20.

13:35.000 --> 13:37.000
How many you need?
I'm cool.

13:36.000 --> 13:39.000
ANNOUNCER: Tom's up.

13:36.000 --> 13:39.000
He's getting a good stretch on.

13:37.000 --> 13:40.000
You believe in a few days we're
gonna have a black president?

13:39.000 --> 13:41.000
We don't expect a whole lot out of this Tom guy, but--

13:40.000 --> 13:41.000
Aren't you excited,
little man?

13:42.000 --> 13:43.000
Eh.

13:42.000 --> 13:44.000
ANNOUNCER: Apologizing here.

13:43.000 --> 13:44.000
"Eh"?

13:44.000 --> 13:46.000
What's "eh"
supposed to mean?

13:44.000 --> 13:47.000
Tom is really putting this relay right back to Ming.

13:46.000 --> 13:47.000
Just means "eh."

13:47.000 --> 13:49.000
What the deal man?
What's going on here?

13:47.000 --> 13:49.000
She locks in, Tom is in midst of celebration.

13:49.000 --> 13:50.000
MAN: Yo, what's deal?
I asked this kid

13:50.000 --> 13:52.000
if he was excited about Obama
and he said "eh".

13:50.000 --> 13:51.000
Pardon me,
are you selling crack?

13:50.000 --> 13:51.000
He can do no wrong.

13:51.000 --> 13:53.000
Uh, what it look like
I'm doing?

13:52.000 --> 13:54.000
"Eh"? He said "eh"?
Yeah.

13:52.000 --> 13:54.000
Oh, looks like it's lights out for Tom.

13:53.000 --> 13:55.000
Here.
Oh, lovely, lovely.

13:54.000 --> 13:55.000
What's wrong with you?
You not excited?

13:55.000 --> 13:57.000
Not excited?
Who ain't excited?

13:55.000 --> 13:57.000
I'll take two, please.

13:56.000 --> 13:58.000
Folks, Ming is really giving the crowd here

13:57.000 --> 13:58.000
This little nigga.
Why ain't he excited?

13:58.000 --> 14:00.000
You don't like Obama.
You want McCain to win.

13:58.000 --> 14:00.000
quite a lesson in kickball today.

13:59.000 --> 14:03.000
Thank you.
Have a wonderful day.

14:00.000 --> 14:03.000
I never said that--
Why ain't you like Barack Obama?

14:01.000 --> 14:03.000
Mr. Freeman steps up.

14:03.000 --> 14:04.000
He got
a lovely family.

14:03.000 --> 14:05.000
He's gonna give it all he's got.

14:04.000 --> 14:05.000
Not according
to this little nigga.

14:04.000 --> 14:07.000
Excuse me, man,
I'm looking for some crack.

14:05.000 --> 14:07.000
He got a problem
with a black president.

14:05.000 --> 14:07.000
And he does give it all he's got,

14:07.000 --> 14:09.000
Boy, what's going on?
What did I tell you

14:07.000 --> 14:08.000
Uh, yeah.
Got your crack right here.

14:07.000 --> 14:09.000
which frankly just is not a lot.

14:08.000 --> 14:12.000
Wait a minute.
You're Thugnificent! Oh, my God.

14:09.000 --> 14:10.000
about talking to anybody
about anything?

14:09.000 --> 14:11.000
Quite anemic,

14:10.000 --> 14:13.000
I didn't say anything.
I ought to kick your ass.

14:11.000 --> 14:13.000
but Mr. Freeman's gonna make it to first base soon as he can.

14:12.000 --> 14:13.000
I don't know
what you're talking about.

14:13.000 --> 14:14.000
Everybody,
just calm down.

14:13.000 --> 14:15.000
No, no, it's you.
It's definitely you.

14:13.000 --> 14:15.000
Looks like he's gonna take one of those

14:14.000 --> 14:15.000
Make a hole, darkies.

14:15.000 --> 14:17.000
Just what the hell
is going on here?

14:15.000 --> 14:17.000
Oh, man,
I love your stuff, man.

14:15.000 --> 14:18.000
"old people walking around the mall" leisurely strolls.

14:17.000 --> 14:19.000
Ruckus?
Oh, no.

14:17.000 --> 14:18.000
What are you doing
out here selling crack?

14:19.000 --> 14:21.000
This little big-haired
nigga hates Obama.

14:19.000 --> 14:21.000
I'm not Thugnificent.
I'm an ordinary crack dealer.

14:19.000 --> 14:21.000
I'm out. Yep, I'm out.

14:21.000 --> 14:23.000
And I say good for him.

14:21.000 --> 14:23.000
I don't know
what you're talking about.

14:23.000 --> 14:25.000
Leave this little boy alone.

14:23.000 --> 14:25.000
Can you please give me
the crack? I need three.

14:23.000 --> 14:24.000
ANNOUNCER: There he goes.

14:24.000 --> 14:26.000
Lights out for the old man.
You're out!

14:25.000 --> 14:26.000
He telling the truth.

14:25.000 --> 14:26.000
Dude,
what happened on your last CD?

14:26.000 --> 14:28.000
Barack Obama
is an evil man.

14:26.000 --> 14:28.000
You're so much better than that.

14:28.000 --> 14:30.000
Hey, everybody,
just calm down.

14:28.000 --> 14:29.000
Don't know
what you talking about.

14:29.000 --> 14:31.000
Can y'all hold this off
for a minute? Crack--

14:29.000 --> 14:32.000
ANNOUNCER: These folks are giving the

14:29.000 --> 14:32.000
Americans quite a schooling.

14:30.000 --> 14:33.000
You heard us.
You say "Yes, we can."

14:31.000 --> 14:33.000
I mean, a couple of the beats
were okay, but Auto-Tuner?

14:32.000 --> 14:34.000
We got an easy out now and the ball...

14:33.000 --> 14:35.000
We say,
"No, you can't, nigga."

14:33.000 --> 14:35.000
The Auto-Tune is fucked up.

14:34.000 --> 14:37.000
Oh, looks like we don't have an easy out.

14:35.000 --> 14:37.000
MAN:
Oh, hell no!

14:35.000 --> 14:38.000
The Auto-Tune is terrible.
Look, I'm not Thugnificent!

14:37.000 --> 14:38.000
RUCKUS:
Ow! I can't see!

14:37.000 --> 14:39.000
I don't know what's going on here,

14:38.000 --> 14:39.000
Now, get the fuck away
from me.

14:39.000 --> 14:41.000
Yo, I'm serious!
Uh, excuse me, sir.

14:39.000 --> 14:40.000
but this American team has lost its wheels.

14:40.000 --> 14:42.000
It's a monkey stampede!

14:41.000 --> 14:43.000
I'd like to return this crack.
What?

14:41.000 --> 14:42.000
Now they got a hit, we got a runner,

14:42.000 --> 14:45.000
Race war!
Somebody get him!

14:42.000 --> 14:44.000
he's being pelted with shoes.

14:43.000 --> 14:45.000
I haven't gotten mine,
and you bringing shit back.

14:44.000 --> 14:47.000
Nice tennis shoes, by the way.

14:45.000 --> 14:47.000
Idiots.
Get in the car quick.

14:45.000 --> 14:47.000
I said I would like
to return this crack.

14:47.000 --> 14:49.000
RILEY:
Drive! Drive! Go, Granddad!

14:47.000 --> 14:49.000
This ain't Walmart.
There ain't no return policies,

14:47.000 --> 14:49.000
Probably made by tiny little hands in a Chinese factory.

14:49.000 --> 14:50.000
no motherfucking exchanges!

14:49.000 --> 14:50.000
Now the Chinese have--

14:50.000 --> 14:53.000
No, no, it is defective
Look, it's all burnt up.

14:50.000 --> 14:52.000
Now that-- Okay, that is just wrong.

14:52.000 --> 14:54.000
NARRATOR: The American press struggles

14:52.000 --> 14:54.000
Now that is three-on-one, and that's horrible.

14:53.000 --> 14:54.000
Look, singed around the edges.

14:54.000 --> 14:56.000
to comprehend the incident.

14:54.000 --> 14:56.000
Ain't nothing wrong with
this crack. Good crack.

14:54.000 --> 14:56.000
Just what the hell
do you think you're doing?

14:56.000 --> 14:58.000
To them, Huey is like a calf

14:56.000 --> 14:58.000
Ain't shit happening
with my crack.

14:56.000 --> 14:58.000
I paid you good money
for this game.

14:58.000 --> 15:00.000
that refuses its mother's udder,

14:58.000 --> 15:01.000
You not good at this, 'cause my
crack dealer is a lot faster.

14:58.000 --> 14:59.000
Yeah? So did he.

15:00.000 --> 15:03.000
choosing instead to drink the bitter waters

15:01.000 --> 15:02.000
Are you gonna be here
for a while?

15:01.000 --> 15:04.000
I'll take
the Chinese money.

15:02.000 --> 15:04.000
I mean, I'd like to go get
my cousin. He's a huge fan.

15:03.000 --> 15:04.000
of its own making.

15:04.000 --> 15:06.000
Here is the danger of too much hope.

15:04.000 --> 15:07.000
WUNCLER:
Listen, I don't care the refs

15:04.000 --> 15:07.000
are cheating.

15:05.000 --> 15:06.000
Don't go get your--

15:06.000 --> 15:08.000
Skeptics are treated like blasphemers,

15:06.000 --> 15:07.000
No, no, wait--
Look, there is no reason

15:07.000 --> 15:10.000
to be rude, I paid good money
for this crack

15:07.000 --> 15:10.000
We cannot lose this game.
The stakes are too high.

15:09.000 --> 15:12.000
and indifference becomes equal to hate.

15:10.000 --> 15:11.000
and it is all burnt up!
Look!

15:10.000 --> 15:12.000
Well, who bet the whole town
on a kickball game?

15:11.000 --> 15:13.000
KID: See, I told you!
Look, see?

15:12.000 --> 15:14.000
Okay, maybe it was
a wrong decision

15:13.000 --> 15:15.000
Sir, sir, sir,
you're not even looking.

15:14.000 --> 15:18.000
to bet all of our economic
futures on a kickball game,

15:15.000 --> 15:17.000
Oh, my God,
it is Thugnificent,

15:16.000 --> 15:19.000
Robert Freeman calls a press conference

15:17.000 --> 15:19.000
I can't believe it.
Can I take your picture?

15:18.000 --> 15:19.000
but we're Americans.

15:19.000 --> 15:20.000
to do damage control.

15:19.000 --> 15:20.000
No! Don't you-- Ni--

15:19.000 --> 15:21.000
We don't quit
just because we're wrong.

15:20.000 --> 15:24.000
Huey Freeman
is not really my grandson.

15:20.000 --> 15:22.000
Don't you see
I'm selling crack?

15:21.000 --> 15:24.000
We just keep doing the wrong
thing until it turns out right.

15:22.000 --> 15:24.000
Could I just get mine and go?
I was supposed to pick up

15:24.000 --> 15:26.000
I refute, renounce,
and rebuke him.

15:24.000 --> 15:25.000
my daughter from school
eight hours ago.

15:24.000 --> 15:26.000
This is stupid.
I'm going home.

15:26.000 --> 15:29.000
I hope this incident
in no way affects my request

15:26.000 --> 15:29.000
Now, if you don't give me
some new crack, or a refund,

15:26.000 --> 15:28.000
What about them, Huey?

15:28.000 --> 15:31.000
Your teammates.
You got them into this.

15:29.000 --> 15:30.000
for VIP inaugural tickets,

15:29.000 --> 15:31.000
I, sir, will take
my business elsewhere.

15:30.000 --> 15:35.000
and/or slash the inaugural ball
with Beyoncé.

15:31.000 --> 15:33.000
Will you motherfuckers
get away from me?

15:31.000 --> 15:33.000
Now you're turning your back
on them?

15:33.000 --> 15:34.000
We gotta make
the motherfuckers pay.

15:35.000 --> 15:37.000
Rosa Parks
is no longer with us,

15:35.000 --> 15:38.000
Man, Leonard, who do I know
that still does cocaine?

15:35.000 --> 15:36.000
Come on, I don't want
to play no more neither,

15:37.000 --> 15:39.000
but I consider myself to be
the next best thing.

15:37.000 --> 15:38.000
but we can't go out
like a bunch of little bitches.

15:38.000 --> 15:40.000
Think, think, think. Oh!

15:39.000 --> 15:42.000
In many ways, better.

15:39.000 --> 15:41.000
Granddad?
I'm trying to save my house

15:40.000 --> 15:42.000
Yo, Steve. Steve
from Hollow Point Records.

15:41.000 --> 15:43.000
and my big-titty porn.

15:42.000 --> 15:44.000
NARRATOR:
Where is your wife?

15:42.000 --> 15:46.000
Yo, that nigga does cocaine
and he got a lot of paper.

15:43.000 --> 15:44.000
It's up to you, Huey.

15:44.000 --> 15:46.000
The sooner you stop
holding back

15:45.000 --> 15:46.000
She's in, uh, D.C.

15:46.000 --> 15:48.000
There was a problem or
something with the tickets,

15:46.000 --> 15:48.000
and decide to play
like a winner,

15:47.000 --> 15:49.000
Hey, yo, Steve.
Uh, it's your boy, Otis.

15:48.000 --> 15:50.000
so we only had one
and I let her have it.

15:48.000 --> 15:50.000
the sooner we can all go home.

15:49.000 --> 15:50.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, man.

15:50.000 --> 15:52.000
Are you afraid
your wife will have

15:50.000 --> 15:52.000
Um, look,
I got some stuff you, uh,

15:52.000 --> 15:54.000
lusty sex
with Barack Obama?

15:52.000 --> 15:55.000
might be interested in.
Ha-ha.

15:52.000 --> 15:54.000
ANNOUNCER: Woodcrest really needs

15:52.000 --> 15:54.000
something

15:54.000 --> 15:55.000
What? No!

15:54.000 --> 15:56.000
happening for them today, because this Chinese team

15:55.000 --> 15:56.000
No doubt, no doubt.
Yeah, just, uh,

15:56.000 --> 15:59.000
tell me when and where.
I'll be there, nigga.

15:56.000 --> 15:58.000
is really owning their a-- Oh!

15:57.000 --> 15:58.000
No. That's impossible.

15:58.000 --> 16:00.000
I didn't ask
if it was possible,

16:00.000 --> 16:01.000
only if you were afraid.

16:00.000 --> 16:03.000
ANNOUNCER:  Now we're talking!

16:02.000 --> 16:05.000
I can't help but notice
you are like a less attractive,

16:03.000 --> 16:05.000
That's the Huey Freeman this city has fallen in love with

16:05.000 --> 16:08.000
less wealthy, less powerful
version of him.

16:05.000 --> 16:07.000
So you know this guy,
and he definitely got the money?

16:05.000 --> 16:07.000
and feared slightly too, I gotta admit that.

16:07.000 --> 16:10.000
Hell, yeah. The nigga runs
the label I almost signed with.

16:07.000 --> 16:10.000
Folks, we got us a game all of a sudden here.

16:08.000 --> 16:11.000
It is quite understandable
for you to be concerned.

16:10.000 --> 16:12.000
But don't be trying
no dumb shit though, man,

16:11.000 --> 16:14.000
NEWSCASTER: Celebrities, dignitaries

16:11.000 --> 16:14.000
and Civil Rights legends

16:12.000 --> 16:13.000
'cause Steve's
a little crazy.

16:13.000 --> 16:15.000
No, he better not be trying
no dumb shit,

16:14.000 --> 16:17.000
are arriving in droves for the inauguration of Barack Obama.

16:15.000 --> 16:17.000
'cause I'm a little crazy.

16:15.000 --> 16:18.000
Folks, we're ready to get back
into the action here,

16:17.000 --> 16:20.000
Anyone hoping to get tickets at this point, don't bother.

16:18.000 --> 16:20.000
but there's no ref.

16:19.000 --> 16:20.000
You here to see Steve?

16:20.000 --> 16:23.000
The ship has sailed and you are not on it,

16:21.000 --> 16:22.000
The fuck you think.

16:22.000 --> 16:24.000
Come on in.

16:23.000 --> 16:24.000
because you are not important.

16:24.000 --> 16:27.000
Hey, Granddad,
this was at the door.

16:24.000 --> 16:25.000
So this is it.

16:25.000 --> 16:27.000
This is your ultimate contest?

16:27.000 --> 16:30.000
"Office of the president-elect?"

16:27.000 --> 16:29.000
In China,
there is this place.

16:28.000 --> 16:30.000
Ha! Otis, what's popping?

16:29.000 --> 16:32.000
I've never seen it,
but I know it exists.

16:30.000 --> 16:32.000
: "Mr. Freeman.

16:30.000 --> 16:31.000
Glad you could make it,
man.

16:32.000 --> 16:34.000
"Please find enclosed two VIP tickets to the inauguration,

16:32.000 --> 16:33.000
Yo, what up, Steve?
These are my friends, uh,

16:32.000 --> 16:34.000
It is called the Glorious Sports
Rehabilitation Center.

16:33.000 --> 16:35.000
Leonard and Ed the Third.
Great to meet you.

16:34.000 --> 16:36.000
"as well as the inaugural ball with Beyoncé,

16:34.000 --> 16:37.000
But really it's a prison camp for athletes

16:35.000 --> 16:37.000
Sit down.
Anybody want anything?

16:36.000 --> 16:39.000
"as a small token of gratitude for all the sacrifices

16:37.000 --> 16:39.000
who have shamed their country by losing.

16:38.000 --> 16:41.000
How you been, Otis?
Not too good, to be honest.

16:39.000 --> 16:42.000
"you've made on behalf of me and this great country.

16:39.000 --> 16:42.000
My grandfather told me if I disgrace him with failure,

16:41.000 --> 16:42.000
I heard you lost your deal.

16:42.000 --> 16:45.000
"I look forward to sharing this historic day with you.

16:42.000 --> 16:44.000
I'm glad you called me.

16:42.000 --> 16:43.000
he will send me there.

16:43.000 --> 16:44.000
I too dream of the day

16:44.000 --> 16:46.000
I think people are getting sick
of all of it, you know?

16:44.000 --> 16:47.000
I can walk away
from this game forever.

16:45.000 --> 16:49.000
Sincerely, President-Elect Barack Obama."

16:46.000 --> 16:48.000
You, Sergeant Gutter,
everything music's been

16:47.000 --> 16:49.000
I am not as lucky as you

16:48.000 --> 16:50.000
for the last decade.
It's a new era, now.

16:49.000 --> 16:50.000
to have that choice.

16:50.000 --> 16:51.000
People want something more.

16:50.000 --> 16:52.000
To live in America.

16:51.000 --> 16:54.000
What's going on?
I'm going to the inauguration.

16:51.000 --> 16:54.000
Yeah, you probably right.
But I believe in you, Otis.

16:52.000 --> 16:53.000
LONG DO: Ming!

16:54.000 --> 16:56.000
You wanna come?
Yeah, boy!

16:54.000 --> 16:55.000
Always have.

16:55.000 --> 16:57.000
Thanks, man. I appreciate that.

16:56.000 --> 16:57.000
NARRATOR: And just like that,

16:57.000 --> 16:59.000
Now, let's get down
to business.

16:58.000 --> 17:01.000
virtually foaming at the mouth with unbridled excitement,

16:59.000 --> 17:01.000
You got something for me?

16:59.000 --> 17:01.000
Tragically,
we've just received word

17:01.000 --> 17:04.000
Robert and Riley leave for the inauguration.

17:01.000 --> 17:03.000
That's about a key.

17:01.000 --> 17:03.000
that the ref
strangled himself,

17:03.000 --> 17:04.000
Maybe an eight-ball
short though.

17:03.000 --> 17:07.000
jumped off a bridge, then overdosed on amphetamines.

17:04.000 --> 17:07.000
Heh-heh.
What is this, cocaine?

17:07.000 --> 17:09.000
Yeah.
I, uh, thought

17:07.000 --> 17:10.000
Oh, send my condolences
to his family.

17:08.000 --> 17:10.000
You are looking at the final mission

17:09.000 --> 17:11.000
we were gonna discuss
a record deal, not a drug deal.

17:10.000 --> 17:12.000
of a domestic terrorist.

17:10.000 --> 17:13.000
But fortunately,
we've found a completely fair

17:11.000 --> 17:13.000
Huh?
You said you had something

17:12.000 --> 17:14.000
Operation Exodus.

17:13.000 --> 17:14.000
I might be interested in

17:13.000 --> 17:15.000
and impartial replacement.

17:14.000 --> 17:18.000
Convinced he has no place in Obama's America,

17:14.000 --> 17:16.000
and I thought you were
talking about music.

17:15.000 --> 17:16.000
Hey, there, Chairman Mao.

17:16.000 --> 17:18.000
Oh, man.

17:18.000 --> 17:21.000
Huey Freeman decides to leave the country for good.

17:18.000 --> 17:20.000
I want back into
the Thugnificent business.

17:18.000 --> 17:21.000
Open up your eyes and let's play
some Jap baseball.

17:20.000 --> 17:22.000
How about $150,000 advance?

17:21.000 --> 17:25.000
And he has an unlikely companion.

17:21.000 --> 17:23.000
ANNOUNCER: Freeman on the mound,

17:22.000 --> 17:23.000
What? Are you serious?

17:23.000 --> 17:25.000
150,000?
You got that kind of money?

17:23.000 --> 17:27.000
and he must really be feeling the pressure right now.

17:25.000 --> 17:27.000
I was gonna go
to the inauguration

17:25.000 --> 17:28.000
Of course I got that
kind of money. Who is this guy?

17:27.000 --> 17:30.000
and try to crown Obama with
a brick, but who am I fooling?

17:28.000 --> 17:29.000
Yo! I cannot believe this!

17:29.000 --> 17:31.000
Yo, I really,
really appreciate this, Steve.

17:30.000 --> 17:31.000
My arm just ain't
what it used to be.

17:31.000 --> 17:33.000
Plus, that greasy nigga
is really fast.

17:31.000 --> 17:33.000
Yo, like,
this is a miracle!

17:31.000 --> 17:33.000
Freeman gives up a base kick

17:33.000 --> 17:35.000
I'm gonna-- I'm not gonna
let you down, man. I promise.

17:33.000 --> 17:35.000
on what should have been an easy strike-out.

17:34.000 --> 17:35.000
And knowing these
liberal activist judges,

17:35.000 --> 17:38.000
they might actually try
and put me in jail for it.

17:35.000 --> 17:37.000
You still
want the drugs, right?

17:36.000 --> 17:38.000
ANNOUNCER: What is going on?

17:37.000 --> 17:39.000
No. I've been clean
for a year.

17:38.000 --> 17:40.000
No, I think...

17:39.000 --> 17:42.000
Freeman is giving up several crucial base kicks.

17:40.000 --> 17:43.000
I think it's time for me
to leave this great country.

17:40.000 --> 17:42.000
Congratulations, Otis.

17:42.000 --> 17:45.000
Thank you so much for believing
in me, Steve, really.

17:43.000 --> 17:44.000
Oh, I can't bear to see it run

17:44.000 --> 17:47.000
by an African Muslim
Communist Antichrist.

17:44.000 --> 17:46.000
Hey, why does the big-haired kid

17:45.000 --> 17:46.000
I-I mean, this means
so much to me.

17:46.000 --> 17:48.000
STEVE:
We're gonna do it right

17:46.000 --> 17:48.000
this time.

17:46.000 --> 17:48.000
suck ass all of a sudden?

17:47.000 --> 17:48.000
I just can't.

17:48.000 --> 17:50.000
It's just like when
Nicole Brown Simpson

17:48.000 --> 17:50.000
You're gonna be
back on top.

17:48.000 --> 17:50.000
Ming told him if we lose,

17:50.000 --> 17:54.000
married that nigga O.J.
back on February 2, 1985.

17:50.000 --> 17:52.000
I came all the way over to this
motherfucker. I want my money.

17:50.000 --> 17:52.000
we all go to a prison camp!

17:53.000 --> 17:55.000
THUGNIFICENT:
I thought we was coming over

17:53.000 --> 17:55.000
here to do a crazy drug deal.

17:55.000 --> 17:57.000
Oh, I knew it was gonna
end badly. I told them.

17:55.000 --> 17:57.000
He believed that?
What a stupid idiot.

17:56.000 --> 17:57.000
My heart was beating
all fast.

17:57.000 --> 17:59.000
I told them all.

17:57.000 --> 17:59.000
It turns out you wanna give me
money for a record deal.

17:59.000 --> 18:00.000
But nobody wanted to listen

17:59.000 --> 18:01.000
I want my money.
I got this new sound

17:59.000 --> 18:01.000
What a dick.
He's an enormous asshole.

18:00.000 --> 18:02.000
to old Uncle Ruckus
then neither.

18:01.000 --> 18:03.000
I been working on too. I want
you to hear it. It's crazy.

18:01.000 --> 18:04.000
I do not like to be laughed at.

18:03.000 --> 18:06.000
This is gonna make everything
in your life better,

18:04.000 --> 18:07.000
I wanna go someplace I'll fit
in, like Norway or Ireland.

18:04.000 --> 18:05.000
Eh?

18:05.000 --> 18:07.000
Hey, did he just--?

18:06.000 --> 18:08.000
and nothing, anyone can do
is gonna stop it.

18:07.000 --> 18:09.000
HUEY:
What about the Ivory Coast?

18:08.000 --> 18:10.000
I want
my motherfucking money.

18:09.000 --> 18:11.000
Absolutely no Africa!
No way!

18:09.000 --> 18:10.000
ANNOUNCER: And a brutal kick

18:10.000 --> 18:12.000
Ed, what are you doing?
Who cares about drugs?

18:11.000 --> 18:12.000
All them countries got
nigga presidents,

18:11.000 --> 18:12.000
takes out the first base runner.

18:12.000 --> 18:14.000
Steve, I'm really sorry,
man.

18:13.000 --> 18:15.000
which defeats the whole purpose
of leaving this country.

18:14.000 --> 18:16.000
What is this, a joke?

18:14.000 --> 18:15.000
Both y'all is out.

18:15.000 --> 18:19.000
NARRATOR:
How do you feel being teamed up

18:15.000 --> 18:19.000
with your archenemy?

18:15.000 --> 18:16.000
Or as they say in your language:

18:16.000 --> 18:17.000
Do you know who I am?

18:18.000 --> 18:19.000
Do you know who I am,
motherfucker?

18:18.000 --> 18:19.000
Yellow nigga.

18:19.000 --> 18:21.000
First of all,
we're not a team.

18:19.000 --> 18:21.000
I'm Ed Wuncler! I brought
the drugs all the way over here.

18:19.000 --> 18:21.000
ANNOUNCER: Unbelievable.

18:21.000 --> 18:23.000
Second of all,
we're not a team.

18:21.000 --> 18:23.000
I did what I was supposed to do.

18:22.000 --> 18:24.000
We are looking at an altogether different type

18:23.000 --> 18:25.000
I've got gas money,
he's got the license.

18:23.000 --> 18:25.000
I fulfilled my motherfucking
end of the bargain,

18:24.000 --> 18:26.000
of kickball game here today.

18:25.000 --> 18:26.000
We're just gonna
drive to Canada

18:25.000 --> 18:28.000
and I want my goddamn
money!

18:26.000 --> 18:28.000
and then go
our separate ways.

18:26.000 --> 18:29.000
Huey with an up in the air over, over and-- Oh!

18:28.000 --> 18:30.000
Hold up, not so fast,
you fat motherfucker!

18:30.000 --> 18:31.000
Ed, Ed, no, no!
Stop!

18:30.000 --> 18:31.000
Wow!

18:31.000 --> 18:34.000
You see, Bill, I consider
myself a black leader now,

18:32.000 --> 18:33.000
Mr. Steve, I hope
this doesn't affect our deal.

18:32.000 --> 18:33.000
Take your base.

18:33.000 --> 18:35.000
Tell me where the safe is,
or the Green Mile over here,

18:33.000 --> 18:35.000
No? Well, dock this Chink
a day's pay

18:34.000 --> 18:37.000
and that means helping Obama
and doing anything he asks.

18:35.000 --> 18:37.000
he's washed up!

18:35.000 --> 18:37.000
for napping on the job.

18:37.000 --> 18:39.000
Oh, yes, I can hear
your concern

18:38.000 --> 18:41.000
MAN:
I think I'm having

18:38.000 --> 18:41.000
a cardiac arrest.

18:39.000 --> 18:40.000
for the state of the world
in that song you did

18:40.000 --> 18:43.000
about stomping people
in the nuts.

18:40.000 --> 18:41.000
Oh!
Take your base.

18:42.000 --> 18:43.000
ANNOUNCER: Oh, my God.

18:43.000 --> 18:45.000
I've never seen moves like this before.

18:44.000 --> 18:46.000
Oh, that was the old me.
Everything's different now.

18:46.000 --> 18:48.000
I'm much, much more politically
aware and stuff.

18:48.000 --> 18:51.000
Really? Well, name the three
branches of government then.

18:48.000 --> 18:49.000
ANNOUNCER: This isn't kickball,

18:49.000 --> 18:51.000
it's a complete free-for-all.

18:51.000 --> 18:53.000
The what?
Come on, black leader.

18:51.000 --> 18:55.000
And neither the coaches nor the referee seem to care.

18:53.000 --> 18:55.000
It's fourth grade
Social Studies time.

18:55.000 --> 18:57.000
What are the three branches
of government?

18:56.000 --> 18:57.000
Hold on, hold on.

18:57.000 --> 18:59.000
Uh, let's see.

18:57.000 --> 18:59.000
Your money ain't
worth shit to me,

18:59.000 --> 19:00.000
They got the main branch.

18:59.000 --> 19:01.000
so don't waste
your cat-flavored breath.

19:01.000 --> 19:03.000
Uh...

19:01.000 --> 19:03.000
Get on your rickshaw
and get out of here.

19:04.000 --> 19:05.000
ANNOUNCER: Into the final inning

19:06.000 --> 19:09.000
If you're a black leader,
I'm glad I'm a white man.

19:06.000 --> 19:08.000
Motherfucker shot me.

19:06.000 --> 19:08.000
the score is now tied 8 to 8.

19:08.000 --> 19:10.000
The fuck
you looking at?

19:08.000 --> 19:10.000
Both teams down to a single player,

19:10.000 --> 19:12.000
You don't want
my goddamn cocaine, huh?

19:10.000 --> 19:13.000
and years from now people will ask of this game,

19:12.000 --> 19:14.000
Well, I'll take my shit
elsewhere.

19:13.000 --> 19:16.000
MAN:
What a moron.

19:13.000 --> 19:15.000
did it happen?

19:15.000 --> 19:20.000
And I say to you now, oh, yes. Yes, it did.

19:23.000 --> 19:26.000
What's the point of talking
if nobody ever learns?

19:32.000 --> 19:36.000
With brotherhood

19:33.000 --> 19:36.000
This is an outrage.
I have my rights.

19:38.000 --> 19:39.000
Oh, them bricks ain't mine.

19:39.000 --> 19:41.000
Ain't that a surprise.

19:41.000 --> 19:42.000
Already taking away

19:42.000 --> 19:44.000
my constitutional right
to bear bricks.

19:44.000 --> 19:46.000
Martial law!
Martial law!

19:46.000 --> 19:47.000
Get your arms off of me.

19:47.000 --> 19:48.000
OBAMA: We remain a young nation,

19:47.000 --> 19:49.000
GRANDDAD:
Boy, what on earth

19:47.000 --> 19:49.000
are you doing?

19:48.000 --> 19:51.000
but in the words of Scripture,

19:49.000 --> 19:51.000
You trying to get
yourself killed?

19:51.000 --> 19:54.000
the time has come to set aside childish things.

19:51.000 --> 19:53.000
I don't know what to do.
Well, get a job.

19:53.000 --> 19:55.000
I tried that.
Well, try again.

19:55.000 --> 19:56.000
You don't understand, Pops.

19:56.000 --> 20:00.000
The time has come to reaffirm our enduring spirit,

19:56.000 --> 19:58.000
I always wanted
to do this rap thing.

19:58.000 --> 20:00.000
And then, you know,
by some miracle,

20:00.000 --> 20:01.000
to choose our part in history.

20:00.000 --> 20:02.000
I actually pulled it off.
I just thought--

20:02.000 --> 20:03.000
I just thought
it would last longer.

20:03.000 --> 20:05.000
It ain't over,
Thugnificent.

20:05.000 --> 20:08.000
No! Please!
I have VIP tickets!

20:05.000 --> 20:08.000
I believe in you.
You like a musical genius.

20:08.000 --> 20:10.000
We all got VIP tickets!

20:08.000 --> 20:10.000
Like-- Like--
Like Ray Charles,

20:10.000 --> 20:11.000
but without the piano skills

20:11.000 --> 20:12.000
Hey.
Get your hands off me.

20:11.000 --> 20:13.000
or the ability to sing
or compose music.

20:11.000 --> 20:13.000
ANNOUNCER: Wait a minute!

20:12.000 --> 20:14.000
All right,
you in trouble now.

20:13.000 --> 20:16.000
Look, man.
I-I can't do this no more.

20:13.000 --> 20:15.000
They have literally destroyed the ball.

20:14.000 --> 20:17.000
I'm calling my nigga Obeezy.

20:15.000 --> 20:17.000
And those red balls are indestructible.

20:16.000 --> 20:18.000
Thanks, old man.

20:17.000 --> 20:19.000
Wait. Wait.

20:18.000 --> 20:19.000
Please don't Tase me.
Don't Tase me, bro.

20:18.000 --> 20:20.000
I know I told you
to eat a lot of dicks.

20:19.000 --> 20:22.000
ANNOUNCER: And look at the determination.

20:20.000 --> 20:21.000
I'm a old man.
I got a heart condition.

20:20.000 --> 20:22.000
But you all right
with me.

20:22.000 --> 20:24.000
Ming trying to crawl to first base.

20:23.000 --> 20:26.000
You can't do this to me!
I'm a Civil Rights legend!

20:24.000 --> 20:27.000
But what is this?

20:26.000 --> 20:28.000
MAN:
Take it down.

20:27.000 --> 20:28.000
Freeman is on his feet.

20:28.000 --> 20:31.000
Save us, Obama!

20:28.000 --> 20:29.000
He's going to tag her out

20:29.000 --> 20:31.000
Oh, Lord, have mercy!

20:30.000 --> 20:33.000
with the smoldering remains of the ball.

20:31.000 --> 20:33.000
He gone! He gone!

20:33.000 --> 20:34.000
Jesus,
you answered my prayers.

20:34.000 --> 20:35.000
NARRATOR: Huey Freeman is forced

20:34.000 --> 20:37.000
I'm tickled as a coon
on Inauguration Day.

20:35.000 --> 20:37.000
to abort Operation Exodus

20:37.000 --> 20:40.000
because he cannot get a ride.

20:44.000 --> 20:47.000
You out, little girl.

20:47.000 --> 20:48.000
ANNOUNCER:  And Woodcrest wins!

20:48.000 --> 20:50.000
It's all over!

20:49.000 --> 20:50.000
Barack Obama?

20:50.000 --> 20:52.000
I just found out that fool
is gonna raise my taxes.

20:50.000 --> 20:52.000
Folks, what a moment in history!

20:52.000 --> 20:54.000
His promises are just
like his tickets: worthless.

20:53.000 --> 20:56.000
LONG DO:
Ming. Are you okay?

20:55.000 --> 20:56.000
Good thing I didn't vote
for his lying ass.

20:56.000 --> 20:58.000
Obama ain't no real nigga.

20:58.000 --> 20:59.000
And check this out:

20:58.000 --> 21:00.000
Wait. I know that song!

20:59.000 --> 21:01.000
I heard he works
for the feds.

21:00.000 --> 21:02.000
Move them butt

21:01.000 --> 21:04.000
That ain't a good look,
Barack.

21:02.000 --> 21:04.000
Move them butt cheeks

21:04.000 --> 21:06.000
Washington
was indescribable.

21:06.000 --> 21:09.000
It was just so amazing.

21:06.000 --> 21:10.000
A deal's a deal, Long.

21:09.000 --> 21:11.000
And I got to meet him.
NARRATOR: Was he everything

21:10.000 --> 21:14.000
Of course.
I am not saddened at my loss.

21:11.000 --> 21:12.000
you dreamed he would be?

21:12.000 --> 21:14.000
Oh, yes, he was.

21:13.000 --> 21:15.000
What's good, lil' homey?
Look, I get off at 5.

21:14.000 --> 21:15.000
And so much more.

21:14.000 --> 21:17.000
There are not many worthy
opponents left, my old friend.

21:15.000 --> 21:17.000
I could come through,
ghost ride the company whip.

21:17.000 --> 21:19.000
Oh, yeah, I'm still down
for the cause and shit,

21:17.000 --> 21:18.000
How you like
the new job?

21:17.000 --> 21:21.000
What fun would it be if the game
were to end for good?

21:18.000 --> 21:20.000
Oh, man,
it's some old bullshit.

21:19.000 --> 21:21.000
but I'm like, hey, I did my
part, you know what I'm saying?

21:20.000 --> 21:21.000
But check it,
check it.

21:21.000 --> 21:22.000
I got the nigga elected.

21:21.000 --> 21:23.000
Your boy is shooting
his own reality show.

21:22.000 --> 21:24.000
Time to get back to work,
feel me?

21:23.000 --> 21:24.000
Word?
Yeah, nigga,

21:23.000 --> 21:25.000
Congratulations,
Mr. Wuncler, sir.

21:24.000 --> 21:26.000
Doing what Thugnificent do.
Besides, them tight-ass clothes

21:25.000 --> 21:26.000
you on it right now!

21:25.000 --> 21:28.000
Your great white leadership made
all the difference in the world.

21:26.000 --> 21:28.000
was cutting off
my circulation.

21:26.000 --> 21:27.000
Yo, what up,
what up, what up?

21:27.000 --> 21:30.000
Young Reezy,
a.k.a. the Fundraiser, nigga.

21:28.000 --> 21:30.000
Due to the conditions
of my parole,

21:28.000 --> 21:30.000
Now what should we do
about them?

21:30.000 --> 21:33.000
I am unable to leave
the country at this time.

21:30.000 --> 21:32.000
Lethal Interjection, bitch.

21:30.000 --> 21:32.000
RILEY: Oh, my pancreas hurts.

21:32.000 --> 21:36.000
Yeah, man, all the paper is in
reality shows, right now, nigga.

21:33.000 --> 21:37.000
I am forced to remain here and
express my extreme displeasure

21:33.000 --> 21:35.000
Let them bask in the moment.

21:35.000 --> 21:38.000
We beat those yellow
motherfuckers.

21:36.000 --> 21:37.000
The music industry's dead.

21:37.000 --> 21:39.000
while in no way threatening

21:37.000 --> 21:38.000
I'm trying to get
that Flava Flav money.

21:38.000 --> 21:40.000
That's who
I'm looking at right now.

21:38.000 --> 21:40.000
Mission accomplished.

21:39.000 --> 21:42.000
the life of the president
and his beautiful monkey family.

21:40.000 --> 21:44.000
Wow, that sound like
a real good plan, Thugnificent.

21:40.000 --> 21:44.000
Yeah, we ain't go out
like no bitches.

21:42.000 --> 21:44.000
NARRATOR: I ask Huey Freeman

21:44.000 --> 21:47.000
Hey, your Granddaddy home?
Hey! Wake up, old nigga!

21:44.000 --> 21:47.000
Even though the people of Tibet
are still not free,

21:45.000 --> 21:47.000
if he has any final thoughts

21:47.000 --> 21:50.000
he'd like to share.

21:47.000 --> 21:49.000
Wanted to let you know until
we get this reality show money,

21:48.000 --> 21:50.000
as symbolic victories go,
this ain't bad.

21:49.000 --> 21:51.000
your boy Thugnificent
is gonna be right here

21:50.000 --> 21:53.000
Yeah. I'm retired.

21:50.000 --> 21:53.000
RILEY:
I think Ms. Von Hausen

21:50.000 --> 21:53.000
might be dead.

21:51.000 --> 21:53.000
handling all your overnight
shipping needs, you smell me?

21:53.000 --> 21:57.000
So ask yourself, what can all
this Thugnificence do for you?

21:53.000 --> 21:55.000
GRANDDAD:
Whoo! Let's go home

21:55.000 --> 21:56.000
and order some Chinese.

21:56.000 --> 21:58.000
GRANDDAD:
Unless you're not in the mood

21:56.000 --> 21:58.000
for Chinese.

21:58.000 --> 22:00.000
Nigga, will you shut
the hell up?

22:00.000 --> 22:02.000
Some of us pay our taxes,

22:02.000 --> 22:04.000
Mr. Punkassnificent!
