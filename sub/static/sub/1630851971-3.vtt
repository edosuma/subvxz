I am not groom-zilla.

00:24.091 --> 00:25.724

We have lived at that hotel.

00:29.096 --> 00:30.753
Why is he doing that?

00:30.831 --> 00:31.772

three and half hours yesterday.

00:31.848 --> 00:33.315
- What is he worried
about that for?

00:33.391 --> 00:35.275
- 'Cause he's the groom-zilla.

00:35.352 --> 00:37.194

to chill a little bit

00:37.270 --> 00:40.447

him to stay in his lane.

00:40.524 --> 00:42.449

00:42.526 --> 00:45.327
We just need you and your mom

- An hour from LA.

03:18.523 --> 03:20.232

03:20.308 --> 03:23.151

04:20.618 --> 04:22.377

after they sold the house,

our friends bought it,

04:32.380 --> 04:34.139

I don't think it hurts to ask.

04:40.722 --> 04:43.148

- Can we recreate it?
- Yeah.

26:22.397 --> 26:25.082
Actually, no sunglasses.
- Yeah, no sunglasses.

26:26.711 --> 26:30.078
- I feel like Carter and I
have this old school romance.

26:30.155 --> 26:33.498
Something that's very rare
and doesn't exist today.

26:33.575 --> 26:36.335
And I feel like we definitely
get that from our parents.

26:36.411 --> 26:40.005
<i>And I just feel like,</i>
<i>when you're raised that way</i>

26:40.082 --> 26:41.548
and that's how you see
your parents grow up,

26:41.625 --> 26:44.343
that is something
that you always want.

26:44.419 --> 26:45.802
Is that her?

26:45.879 --> 26:47.354
- I can't tell.

26:50.050 --> 26:52.809
- Hi.
- Hey.

26:52.886 --> 26:55.812
- [gasps]
- What's wrong?

26:55.889 --> 26:57.990
What? What happened?

27:04.040 --> 27:06.365
- Hi.
- Hey.

27:06.375 --> 27:09.159
- [gasps]
- What's wrong?

27:09.236 --> 27:12.254
What? What happened?

27:14.366 --> 27:16.583

- Hi. How you doing?

27:16.660 --> 27:18.710
- Are you okay?

27:18.787 --> 27:21.630
- I haven't been here...

27:21.641 --> 27:24.007
in a year and a half.

27:24.084 --> 27:25.384
The last time I was here,

27:25.394 --> 27:28.228
I got the call
at 1:00 in the morning.

27:28.305 --> 27:31.565
And I didn't want Papa...

27:33.468 --> 27:34.801
To be taken out.

27:36.221 --> 27:39.073
And I came over
'cause Dad was flown away.

27:41.235 --> 27:43.577
And I came up into his room.

27:45.039 --> 27:48.073
And I laid with him
for 20 minutes.

27:48.150 --> 27:49.908
<i>And I wrote a note</i>
<i>from all of us.</i>

27:49.985 --> 27:51.576
<i>And I pulled pictures.</i>

27:51.653 --> 27:53.245
<i>And pictures of you</i>
<i>when you were little,</i>

27:53.321 --> 27:56.915
<i>Nicky, all the kids,</i>
<i>everybody.</i>

27:56.926 --> 28:00.969
And I put them in his pocket.

28:01.046 --> 28:04.089
And I kissed him
and I hugged him.

28:04.166 --> 28:06.425
And I thought,
I'll never go back there again.

28:06.435 --> 28:07.393
- [sighs]

28:08.879 --> 28:10.679
- So it's weird to be here.

28:10.690 --> 28:12.681
<i>- It makes me sad that...</i>

28:12.692 --> 28:16.068

28:16.145 --> 28:18.437

28:18.513 --> 28:22.607
<i>I wish he could be there</i>
<i>with us on our wedding.</i>

28:22.684 --> 28:25.828
He'd be so happy.

28:25.904 --> 28:28.155
- Yeah, it looks different.

28:28.231 --> 28:30.449
You think that things
are going--

28:30.525 --> 28:34.619

28:34.696 --> 28:38.290
All good things
must come to an end.

28:38.366 --> 28:40.083
- He's definitely looking down

28:40.160 --> 28:41.835
thinking about you two
right now.

28:41.846 --> 28:46.381
- I know,
I can feel him and Nanu.

28:46.458 --> 28:50.051
- I was 15 years old the
first time I was at the house.

28:50.128 --> 28:54.181
I--I feel like the house
is a relative.

28:54.257 --> 28:56.859

28:56.935 --> 28:59.519

28:59.596 --> 29:01.438

29:01.515 --> 29:03.523

29:04.860 --> 29:06.568
I think that you two
will want to

29:06.645 --> 29:09.654
make your grand entrance
and come out.

29:09.731 --> 29:12.157
And come down the steps
and I mean, you--you're gonna

29:12.234 --> 29:14.451
plan it and do what you want,
but that's nice.

29:14.528 --> 29:16.295
- I'm happy that you came, Mom.

29:16.371 --> 29:18.756
- Well, I'm happy I was there.

29:20.742 --> 29:23.635
- We were thinking about
seated dinner in this area.

29:23.712 --> 29:26.889
- What we've done is basically
we've tented in a big,

29:26.965 --> 29:28.465
clear tent because...
- Yeah.

29:28.542 --> 29:30.016
- it's so beautiful to look...
- Oh, yeah,

29:30.094 --> 29:31.635
you could do a clear tent.
- Through it to this pool.

29:31.711 --> 29:35.847
I do feel that this whole thing
is meant to be.

29:35.924 --> 29:40.685
It's just...incredible.

29:40.762 --> 29:42.646
- Would you
ever build trellises?

29:42.722 --> 29:44.523
I think is the right word.
'Cause my sister,

29:44.599 --> 29:46.784
we built trellises.
- I love a trellis.

29:46.860 --> 29:48.276
- And then you don't have
a tent and you could put

29:48.287 --> 29:49.861
the heat lamps 'cause it will
be a little cold,

29:49.938 --> 29:51.780
off the trellis.
Flowers. Be cool.

29:51.857 --> 29:54.741
- Gor--I love that.
I actually like that more.

Paris and groom-zilla's
happiness is all I care about.

30:02.835 --> 30:06.461
What I would do, I mean,
I think that less is more.

30:06.538 --> 30:10.641
And maybe tell them not to...

30:11.960 --> 30:13.218
- Grow their flowers?
[laughs]

30:13.295 --> 30:14.553
- Yeah, exactly.
- I like, personally,

30:14.629 --> 30:16.096
just a white garden.
- Yeah.

30:16.172 --> 30:17.689
[laughter]

30:17.766 --> 30:19.641
Paris, can I count on you for
that conversation with them?

30:19.718 --> 30:21.018
- Yeah, can we rip out
all your flowers?

30:21.020 --> 30:23.186
- Just roses.
No usually it's just roses.

30:23.263 --> 30:24.688
- All right,
I have to go see an investor.

30:24.764 --> 30:27.440
- Okay.
- So good to see you.

30:27.517 --> 30:28.592
All right.

to nothing.

30:37.052 --> 30:42.455
Who would think that it just
all worked out so perfectly?

30:42.532 --> 30:44.583
- What do you think
of the groom-zilla?

30:44.593 --> 30:47.594
- I think he's very sweet.
Very sweet.

30:49.623 --> 30:52.048
But he better watch out.
