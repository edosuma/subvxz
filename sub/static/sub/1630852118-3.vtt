TWO YEARS EARLIER
JUNE 20TH, 2015

00:30.280 --> 00:31.448
MR. ACP'S VERSION

00:31.531 --> 00:33.992
<i>At about 10:00 a.m., I got to my store</i>

00:34.075 --> 00:38.163
<i>and noticed that there was a vehicle</i>

00:38.830 --> 00:42.000
<i>parked in front</i>
<i>of Mr. Antonio's convenience store.</i>

00:45.795 --> 00:49.883
<i>We saw they didn't have</i>
<i>any trouble starting the car.</i>

00:50.467 --> 00:55.805
<i>They moved really slowly</i>
<i>and kept looking at the store.</i>

01:00.185 --> 01:03.605
<i>It was a Saturday,</i>
<i>so we closed at 2:00 p.m.</i>

01:05.982 --> 01:08.318
<i>And we left for Ciudad Pemex.</i>

01:08.401 --> 01:13.823
<i>We drove slowly to avoid catching up</i>
<i>with the suspicious car.</i>

01:18.661 --> 01:20.038
<i>Near the church,</i>

01:20.580 --> 01:24.042
<i>we saw the van,</i>
<i>so we slowed down even more.</i>

01:24.125 --> 01:27.253
<i>Suddenly, two cars came out of nowhere.</i>

01:27.337 --> 01:32.050
<i>They blocked the way,</i>
<i>so I maneuvered and managed to avoid them.</i>

01:32.717 --> 01:35.220
<i>Fifty meters before the gas station,</i>

01:35.303 --> 01:37.931
<i>I couldn't continue</i>
<i>because the van blocked my way.</i>

01:38.014 --> 01:42.644
<i>The driver of the Jetta took his hand out</i>
<i>and pointed at me with a gun.</i>

01:43.686 --> 01:46.648
<i>He bumped into my car</i>
<i>and I was forced to stop.</i>

01:46.731 --> 01:48.817
<i>So I reached for my .22 pistol.</i>

01:49.400 --> 01:51.653
<i>When he stuck his hand through the window,</i>

01:52.153 --> 01:53.905
<i>my reaction was to shoot.</i>

01:58.910 --> 02:02.038
ACP, well… let's be honest.

02:02.622 --> 02:06.417
If your sister was kidnapped,
they tried kidnapping your brother,

02:06.501 --> 02:09.087
and someone gets out of a car
carrying something,

02:09.170 --> 02:13.216
you don't know if they want
to kidnap you, rob you, kill your or what.

02:13.299 --> 02:15.885
I'd also carry a gun and I'd use it.

02:16.886 --> 02:18.263
What's the risk?

02:18.346 --> 02:22.892
Maybe I kill a guy carrying pliers
and I get into deep trouble, right?

02:24.894 --> 02:28.731
A NETFLIX DOCUMENTARY SERIES

03:10.023 --> 03:10.940
<i>Let's see.</i>

03:13.067 --> 03:18.531
<i>The time is 11:35 a.m.</i>

03:19.490 --> 03:22.243
<i>We're not in the hearing.</i>
<i>I'm being notified.</i>

03:22.327 --> 03:24.871
<i>I have the right to film</i>
<i>what they tell me.</i>

03:24.954 --> 03:26.956
<i>If you want, we can go outside.</i>

03:27.040 --> 03:28.333
<i>-Yes.</i>
<i>-Okay.</i>

03:28.416 --> 03:30.376
<i>-Do it outside.</i>
<i>-Okay.</i>

03:30.460 --> 03:36.174
<i>Just for the record,</i>
<i>it's June 9th, 11:35 a.m.</i>

03:36.716 --> 03:37.675
<i>Adi!</i>

03:45.141 --> 03:48.228
On the last day of the public trial
about Gladis's case,

03:49.229 --> 03:52.899
a court official comes in

03:53.691 --> 03:56.819
and whispered something
to the chief judge.

03:58.404 --> 04:01.241
And that's when it all changed again.

04:01.908 --> 04:07.163
<i>The administration has just informed me</i>
<i>that we need to take a recess</i>

04:07.247 --> 04:10.166
<i>because we received an order for arrest.</i>

04:10.250 --> 04:13.586
<i>The time and date</i>
<i>of the hearing there specified</i>

04:13.670 --> 04:16.965
<i>coincides with this hearing.</i>

04:20.718 --> 04:22.178
Why turn off the cameras?

04:22.262 --> 04:25.640
If I'm in court, I want it on video.

04:26.224 --> 04:29.602
<i>I want it to be on camera. It's 11:35…</i>

04:29.686 --> 04:31.187
<i>Let me speak to the judge.</i>

04:31.271 --> 04:33.273
<i>You can't do that, sorry.</i>

04:33.356 --> 04:36.067
<i>-Excuse me?</i>
<i>-Was he filming you?</i>

04:37.318 --> 04:40.071
<i>I can't record while you're notifying me?</i>

04:40.780 --> 04:42.240
<i>In the court room…</i>

04:42.323 --> 04:45.451
<i>-No, outside.</i>
<i>-But it was inside.</i>

04:45.535 --> 04:47.996
<i>I asked him to notify me out here.</i>

04:48.079 --> 04:49.956
They interrupted the hearing

04:50.039 --> 04:55.128
where it was being decided that these guys
were innocent and would be absolved.

04:55.211 --> 04:58.506
And they're informed
that a hearing had been arranged

04:59.007 --> 05:03.845
about the indictment
for ACP's attempted kidnapping.

05:04.721 --> 05:07.432
<i>What exactly are you telling us?</i>

05:07.515 --> 05:08.516
<i>That</i>…

05:09.851 --> 05:11.811
<i>there's an order for arrest</i>

05:11.894 --> 05:15.064
<i>for Juan Luis,</i>
<i>Héctor Muñoz and Gonzalo García.</i>

05:15.148 --> 05:19.068
They wanted the judges
to see us as kidnappers.

05:19.152 --> 05:22.238
It didn't matter how, they wanted…

05:22.947 --> 05:24.532
the judges to sentence us.

05:25.158 --> 05:28.202
<i>Our public trial hearing</i>
<i>has just been suspended</i>

05:28.286 --> 05:32.248
<i>to tell us that, at the same time,</i>
<i>we have a hearing we didn't know about.</i>

05:32.332 --> 05:36.461
<i>You know we have to be notified</i>
<i>24 hours beforehand, so we can prepare?</i>

05:36.544 --> 05:38.421
<i>This is an urgent hearing.</i>

05:38.504 --> 05:40.590
<i>It has to take place today,</i>

05:40.673 --> 05:45.345
<i>because, constitutionally,</i>
<i>it needs to be today.</i>

05:45.428 --> 05:48.765
<i>But the district attorney's office</i>
<i>knew, and we didn't.</i>

05:48.848 --> 05:51.392
<i>You can ask all that in administration.</i>

05:51.476 --> 05:53.436
They want to take us by surprise.

05:53.519 --> 05:57.648
What they aren't expecting
is for us to agree to the hearing.

06:02.153 --> 06:05.782
Today you want to prove
they weren't linked with the incident.

06:05.865 --> 06:08.701
At least keep them
from being detained pre-trial.

06:08.785 --> 06:10.661
How will you do it?

06:10.745 --> 06:14.165
For a pre-trial detention,
there is a burden of proof.

06:14.248 --> 06:19.337
There can't just be
one isolated piece of evidence,

06:19.420 --> 06:22.256
like a single sworn statement.

06:22.340 --> 06:24.884
That's all they have,
there can't be anything else.

06:24.967 --> 06:26.636
In the bail hearing,

06:26.719 --> 06:29.931
they decide if someone will be…

06:30.890 --> 06:32.850
accused of a crime.

06:33.643 --> 06:37.480
<i>We're currently in courtroom two</i>
<i>of the Federal Trial Court</i>

06:37.563 --> 06:40.441
<i>to conduct the hearing</i>

06:40.525 --> 06:43.111
<i>involving Mr. Juan Luis López García,</i>

06:43.194 --> 06:45.988
<i>Mr. Gonzalo García Hernández</i>
<i>and Mr. Héctor Muñoz Muñoz</i>

06:46.572 --> 06:48.491
<i>in the attempted kidnapping</i>

06:48.574 --> 06:51.869
<i>of the victim with the initials ACP.</i>

06:51.953 --> 06:54.038
MR. ACP
VICTIM OF UNDISCLOSED IDENTITY

06:54.122 --> 06:57.041
If they could convince
the arraignment judge

06:57.125 --> 07:00.336
that the events had not occurred
as ACP had described,

07:00.420 --> 07:01.546
they'd be released.

07:02.130 --> 07:04.132
But if they were linked to the events,

07:04.215 --> 07:06.759
because it was a kidnapping accusation,

07:06.843 --> 07:09.929
basically just for being accused
of kidnapping,

07:10.012 --> 07:11.347
they'd be sent to jail.

07:11.431 --> 07:14.559
We were convinced
they would not be indicted.

07:15.268 --> 07:19.021
We were afraid
they would bring out more evidence.

07:19.105 --> 07:20.857
Help me with this.

07:20.940 --> 07:25.069
What we need right now
is to see if we can find anything,

07:25.153 --> 07:27.488
testimonies, videos, whatever,

07:27.572 --> 07:30.450
that will allow me to prove to the judge

07:30.533 --> 07:33.494
that the events didn't happen
as ACP described.

07:33.578 --> 07:38.332
When you say "find anything,"
would an eyewitness do?

07:38.416 --> 07:39.876
That would be ideal.

07:49.218 --> 07:50.845
They know everything.

07:55.933 --> 07:58.936
They're throwing the defense a curveball.

07:59.520 --> 08:01.063
We have 50 minutes

08:01.731 --> 08:04.734
to find a person
who will be willing to testify.

08:04.817 --> 08:08.321
Someone who saw what happened
at the gas station two years ago

08:08.404 --> 08:10.531
and can explain what happened.

08:32.762 --> 08:33.596
Okay.

08:36.474 --> 08:41.646
Now, you have the chance
to help her husband and her brother…

08:41.729 --> 08:44.649
-Let's go over there.
-Okay.

08:45.399 --> 08:46.359
In private.

08:46.442 --> 08:49.278
We can talk in the car if you want.

08:49.362 --> 08:50.196
Let's go.

08:50.279 --> 08:52.240
When the shooting happened,

08:52.323 --> 08:54.242
it was the father and the son.

08:54.325 --> 08:55.660
They were in the car.

08:55.743 --> 09:01.249
Yes, they were together in the car
when they shot the guy.

09:01.332 --> 09:03.876
I was with my daughter
over there, in Oxxo.

09:03.960 --> 09:07.463
So I saw when the man
stopped his van on the other side,

09:07.547 --> 09:11.759
and the other guy was just driving
his little green car.

09:11.842 --> 09:14.554
He ran towards us, asking for help.

09:15.263 --> 09:17.640
He was shouting, "Look, they shot me!"

09:17.723 --> 09:21.227
She heard the accident,
saw Héctor get out of the car,

09:21.310 --> 09:25.314
she heard ACP shooting him.

09:25.398 --> 09:29.402
She saw Héctor running,
scared for his life.

09:29.485 --> 09:33.364
She saw that Gonzalo and Juan Luis's van
was there beforehand,

09:33.447 --> 09:35.700
that they had nothing to do with it.

09:35.783 --> 09:37.702
She saw the whole situation.

09:37.785 --> 09:40.955
They've been in jail for almost two years.

09:41.038 --> 09:43.124
And we need an eyewitness.

09:43.708 --> 09:46.544
And the hearing is taking place

09:46.627 --> 09:49.255
in about 20, 30 minutes.

09:49.922 --> 09:54.176
Thanks to you and the pictures you took,
we now know what really happened.

09:54.760 --> 09:57.138
I need to go get my daughter…

09:57.805 --> 09:59.640
-That's the only thing.
-Where is she?

09:59.724 --> 10:01.017
In my house.

10:01.100 --> 10:04.103
She's alone,
because my husband brought me here.

10:04.186 --> 10:06.772
Let's go pick her up.

10:06.856 --> 10:08.733
In that case, I can go.

10:34.592 --> 10:37.553
TRIAL COURT

10:40.681 --> 10:43.225
She was still wearing her uniform,

10:43.309 --> 10:46.604
advertising the popsicles she sold.

10:46.687 --> 10:50.775
The first thing the court did
was basically tell her off,

10:50.858 --> 10:53.194
asking why she was dressed like that,

10:54.111 --> 10:55.696
so casually, in court.

10:56.906 --> 10:58.115
Instead of thinking,

10:58.199 --> 11:01.077
"What important information
does this witness have?"

11:01.160 --> 11:04.372
the first thing they did
was discriminate against her.

11:04.455 --> 11:06.999
They want her to change her shirt,

11:07.083 --> 11:09.710
they want her to wear something else,

11:09.794 --> 11:11.087
with no cap.

11:15.549 --> 11:20.096
"This person is not dressed properly,
I don't care what she has to say."

11:31.941 --> 11:37.571
<i>We want to present</i>
<i>Miguelina Hernández Oramas's testimony.</i>

11:40.491 --> 11:42.326
<i>Do you know why you're here?</i>

11:42.410 --> 11:46.622
<i>Yes, I witnessed</i>
<i>what happened at the gas station.</i>

11:46.706 --> 11:48.833
<i>Tell us what you saw.</i>

11:49.709 --> 11:52.002
<i>From the beginning. What happened?</i>

11:52.086 --> 11:54.714
<i>I was standing at the door of Oxxo.</i>

11:54.797 --> 11:56.924
<i>The man pulled out a gun</i>
<i>and fired a shot.</i>

11:57.007 --> 11:58.467
<i>Who was this man?</i>

11:58.551 --> 12:00.970
<i>I'm talking about Mr. Alfonso.</i>

12:02.221 --> 12:03.180
<i>Your Honor.</i>

12:03.681 --> 12:04.515
<i>Continue.</i>

12:04.598 --> 12:07.184
<i>She didn't say his surname, so it's fine.</i>

12:07.268 --> 12:10.020
<i>How do you know his name is Alfonso?</i>

12:10.104 --> 12:14.233
<i>Because the police identified him.</i>
<i>"What happened, Mr. Alfonso?"</i>

12:14.316 --> 12:18.404
<i>Right. You also said</i>
<i>that while all this was going on,</i>

12:18.487 --> 12:20.573
<i>you recorded it with your phone.</i>

12:20.656 --> 12:25.995
<i>I started recording because I saw</i>
<i>how those poor guys were being taken.</i>

12:26.078 --> 12:29.957
<i>They were hitting them</i>
<i>as if they were criminals, as if…</i>

12:30.040 --> 12:33.836
<i>I saw they were just standing there,</i>
<i>they hadn't done anything.</i>

12:33.919 --> 12:36.422
<i>Those are not kidnappers.</i>

12:36.505 --> 12:37.840
<i>They're customers.</i>

12:43.804 --> 12:47.808
Even though you couldn't tell
precisely what had happened,

12:48.309 --> 12:51.520
the video proved, without a doubt,

12:51.604 --> 12:55.983
that Miguelina had been there
that day, at the time it all happened.

12:56.066 --> 12:58.736
So she was, indeed, an eyewitness.

12:58.819 --> 13:00.613
That reinforced her testimony.

13:00.696 --> 13:04.700
<i>Did you see them try to kidnap the man?</i>

13:06.160 --> 13:09.246
<i>No. The guys were there first,</i>
<i>they were already there.</i>

13:09.330 --> 13:12.583
<i>Did you see, at any point,</i>
<i>any contact or communication</i>

13:12.666 --> 13:16.170
<i>between the guy that was shot</i>
<i>and the guys in the van?</i>

13:16.253 --> 13:17.296
<i>Not at all.</i>

13:17.880 --> 13:18.923
<i>I'm very observant.</i>

13:19.006 --> 13:20.841
<i>I saw everything, I was there.</i>

13:20.925 --> 13:22.760
<i>I'm a witness because I saw it.</i>

13:22.843 --> 13:25.179
<i>And my little girl reacted too.</i>

13:25.262 --> 13:27.223
<i>She was terrified</i>

13:27.306 --> 13:30.893
<i>when that man pulled out a gun</i>
<i>and wanted to shoot again.</i>

13:30.976 --> 13:31.977
<i>I told him,</i>

13:32.061 --> 13:35.189
<i>"Don't do it, you'll hurt my daughter."</i>

13:35.272 --> 13:37.358
<i>"Look, there's a little girl here."</i>

13:37.441 --> 13:40.027
<i>And he didn't care,</i>
<i>he was out of his mind.</i>

13:40.110 --> 13:43.864
<i>And what did the police do</i>
<i>when they saw he was armed?</i>

13:43.948 --> 13:46.659
<i>He hid the gun really quickly.</i>

13:46.742 --> 13:49.495
<i>He put his hand in his pants pocket.</i>

13:49.578 --> 13:52.540
<i>He hid it, and signaled to me to be quiet.</i>

13:52.623 --> 13:54.291
<i>But I'm not like that.</i>

13:54.375 --> 13:57.795
<i>My daughter could've been hurt,</i>
<i>I wasn't going to stay quiet.</i>

13:58.712 --> 14:00.047
<i>What do you do?</i>

14:00.548 --> 14:02.842
<i>I have been selling BonIce</i>

14:02.925 --> 14:05.719
<i>for three years now.</i>

14:05.803 --> 14:07.221
<i>Sorry, what do you sell?</i>

14:07.304 --> 14:09.682
<i>The brand BonIce. Snacks, pork rinds.</i>

14:09.765 --> 14:13.185
<i>I was working that day,</i>
<i>and that man approached me.</i>

14:13.269 --> 14:15.813
<i>"I want to talk to you,"</i>
<i>he said with a scary look.</i>

14:15.896 --> 14:19.400
<i>He threatened me. He said he'd fuck me up.</i>

14:19.483 --> 14:22.152
<i>Miguelina, when this man threatened you,</i>

14:22.236 --> 14:24.822
<i>what did he want?</i>
<i>What did he ask you to do?</i>

14:24.905 --> 14:26.782
<i>To stay silent about what I saw.</i>

14:26.866 --> 14:29.159
<i>"Why would I stay silent?"</i>

14:29.243 --> 14:31.745
<i>"If he pulls a gun on me?"</i>

14:31.829 --> 14:33.914
<i>"I won't stay silent, no way."</i>

14:33.998 --> 14:37.710
She knew ACP,
his full name, and his story perfectly.

14:37.793 --> 14:40.546
It's a small town,
they all know each other.

14:40.629 --> 14:44.425
He threatened her to stay quiet
or she would be killed.

14:44.508 --> 14:47.845
He was going to threaten anyone
who could speak up.

14:47.928 --> 14:51.307
This lady, Mrs. Delfín,
the district attorney now,

14:51.390 --> 14:54.226
with another district attorney,
Mr. Covarrubias,

14:54.310 --> 14:56.729
were there when they arrested my brother.

14:56.812 --> 15:00.399
They took them to a safe house.
That was no district attorney's office.

15:00.482 --> 15:04.528
And she even spoke to me
when I took my brother's documents

15:04.612 --> 15:06.739
to get the release agreement.

15:07.406 --> 15:09.700
There has been no investigation.

15:09.783 --> 15:13.120
The district attorney in there
signed a release agreement.

15:13.203 --> 15:16.248
After that agreement, after that day,

15:16.332 --> 15:18.876
there has been no further investigation.

15:20.127 --> 15:23.005
And today, with the very same information,

15:23.088 --> 15:26.050
two years later, she wants to detain them

15:26.133 --> 15:28.052
and carry out a trial.

15:30.846 --> 15:36.435
<i>You've stated</i>
<i>that you have received threats, correct?</i>

15:36.518 --> 15:37.353
<i>Yes.</i>

15:38.979 --> 15:44.777
<i>And those threats were made</i>
<i>by Mr. Alfonso, correct?</i>

15:44.860 --> 15:45.736
<i>That's right.</i>

15:46.236 --> 15:50.783
<i>Regarding these threats,</i>
<i>did you report them to the police?</i>

15:51.575 --> 15:52.409
<i>No.</i>

15:52.910 --> 15:53.786
<i>Why not?</i>

15:53.869 --> 15:56.538
<i>When you report something</i>
<i>to the authorities,</i>

15:56.622 --> 15:58.540
<i>they always ask for witnesses.</i>

15:58.624 --> 16:04.672
<i>It would be pointless to report him, then,</i>
<i>since they wouldn't do anything about it.</i>

16:11.345 --> 16:13.430
What he's doing is unfair.

16:13.973 --> 16:17.977
Accusing innocent people
and having them locked up. Honestly.

16:19.478 --> 16:21.605
I think they will be released today,

16:21.689 --> 16:26.068
or maybe the judge will sleep on it
and make a decision tomorrow.

16:26.151 --> 16:27.194
I don't know.

16:29.530 --> 16:31.907
We just have to wait now.

16:33.242 --> 16:34.284
Yes.

16:34.368 --> 16:36.620
We just need to wait a bit more.

16:45.170 --> 16:50.384
<i>At 11:25 p.m. on June 9th, 2017,</i>

16:50.467 --> 16:51.927
<i>we deliver this verdict.</i>

16:52.011 --> 16:55.556
<i>First of all, Mr. Juan Luis López García,</i>

16:55.639 --> 16:58.851
<i>Mr. Gonzalo García Hernández</i>
<i>and Mr. Héctor Muñoz Muñoz</i>

16:58.934 --> 17:00.894
<i>will be detained pending trial.</i>

17:02.229 --> 17:05.024
<i>We won't give up. Don't you worry.</i>

17:05.107 --> 17:07.693
<i>All the civil servants that were involved</i>

17:07.776 --> 17:10.696
<i>in extending this unfair imprisonment</i>

17:10.779 --> 17:12.573
<i>will pay for it, I swear.</i>

17:13.073 --> 17:14.074
<i>I swear.</i>

17:35.888 --> 17:37.306
POLICE

18:20.557 --> 18:24.812
861 DAYS IN PRISON

18:35.197 --> 18:38.117
They do a roll call
at about seven in the morning.

18:40.035 --> 18:42.788
Sometimes,
you can't even afford an egg here.

18:43.872 --> 18:46.208
You have to eat whatever they give you…

18:46.291 --> 18:47.167
ACCUSED INMATE

18:47.251 --> 18:49.545
…and sometimes the food is…

18:49.628 --> 18:51.713
You eat it just because…

18:52.589 --> 18:53.924
you're hungry.

18:54.716 --> 18:57.344
The next meal is at 2:00 p.m.

18:57.427 --> 19:00.013
By then, you're even hungrier.

19:00.097 --> 19:03.225
Sometimes you get the same food
you ate in the morning.

19:04.268 --> 19:07.646
And then it's the afternoon roll call,
you go out.

19:08.438 --> 19:10.649
You play sports or work.

19:20.367 --> 19:21.785
There's nowhere to go.

19:21.869 --> 19:25.038
That way, there's a wall.
The other way, another wall.

19:26.665 --> 19:29.877
You have to be patient
and learn how to tolerate it.

19:34.715 --> 19:39.052
In the late afternoon, we sit outside
and look at the sky, the clouds.

19:39.678 --> 19:41.263
It's all we can see.

19:43.140 --> 19:45.017
The next day, the same thing.

19:45.601 --> 19:47.561
The same routine every day.

19:48.896 --> 19:52.608
The more time you spend
lying in bed inside, the more you think.

19:52.691 --> 19:57.196
"What is my family doing?
What are my kids thinking?"

19:57.821 --> 19:59.489
"What will happen to my house?"

20:01.825 --> 20:04.703
Yes, you end up getting bored…

20:04.786 --> 20:05.621
ACCUSED INMATE

20:05.704 --> 20:08.749
…you realize you're not free anymore,
you have no money.

20:08.832 --> 20:10.626
What you make isn't enough.

20:11.210 --> 20:13.545
We're not from Macuspana.

20:13.629 --> 20:15.297
My family can't visit often.

20:15.797 --> 20:17.883
How much is the bus ticket now?

20:18.383 --> 20:19.801
It's 198 pesos.

20:19.885 --> 20:22.054
And how much is his ticket?

20:22.137 --> 20:23.931
Fernando's? It's 198 too.

20:25.432 --> 20:26.642
Like an adult.

20:28.602 --> 20:31.146
And Juan will pay full price soon too.

20:33.190 --> 20:35.943
He's short, so they think he's younger.

20:36.735 --> 20:38.570
Juanito, are you short?

20:39.363 --> 20:40.656
Dad, are you fat?

20:47.037 --> 20:48.372
He got you good.

20:56.588 --> 20:58.507
Yes, I used to visit Juan Luis,

21:00.133 --> 21:05.681
but when they locked him up again…

21:05.764 --> 21:08.392
I kind of lost hope.

21:09.685 --> 21:12.020
I distanced myself from everything.

21:12.688 --> 21:14.982
I couldn't keep spending money on that

21:15.065 --> 21:18.110
because I had to provide for the children.

21:24.408 --> 21:27.536
It's made me drift apart from my home.

21:28.996 --> 21:31.790
My kids' expenses, school…

21:31.873 --> 21:33.667
I used to be involved in that.

21:33.750 --> 21:35.627
Now she has to work.

21:35.711 --> 21:38.797
She has to leave my children
to go make a few bucks

21:38.880 --> 21:42.592
to feed them and keep them in school.

21:43.593 --> 21:47.264
Every day that goes by,
it's harder for me to be with my family.

21:50.600 --> 21:53.478
There's a large beach called Sacaolas.

21:53.562 --> 21:57.065
We used to go every year
to have fun, get in the water.

21:57.149 --> 21:59.026
We'd go for the day.

22:02.362 --> 22:05.282
Once, I was teaching Fernando
to ride a motorbike.

22:05.907 --> 22:07.743
I was sitting behind him.

22:07.826 --> 22:10.037
I told him, "Now let go, slowly."

22:10.120 --> 22:13.373
And he lifted the motorbike up in the air.

22:17.377 --> 22:18.628
And he got scared.

22:18.712 --> 22:20.714
"You'll learn, but slowly."

22:21.590 --> 22:24.009
But I didn't get to teach him.

22:31.767 --> 22:35.896
I would love to think
that this case is an isolated case.

22:36.646 --> 22:41.276
That in our country, it's hard or unusual

22:41.360 --> 22:43.236
for someone to be framed,

22:43.320 --> 22:46.698
to make up evidence
to make someone seem guilty.

22:46.782 --> 22:50.786
In most of the cases I have heard of,

22:50.869 --> 22:52.954
there's usually no investigation.

22:53.038 --> 22:57.209
And the little investigation
that there is isn't objective,

22:57.292 --> 22:59.252
its aim is not to find the truth,

22:59.336 --> 23:02.798
but to prove
whatever someone is trying to prove.

23:07.677 --> 23:08.553
Exactly.

23:10.555 --> 23:11.890
They took the car.

23:21.858 --> 23:23.485
We reconstructed the events

23:23.568 --> 23:27.614
based on the version
told by ACP and his son,

23:27.697 --> 23:29.199
and Héctor's version.

23:29.282 --> 23:34.413
That helped us understand
what version of the facts is true.

23:42.212 --> 23:45.757
Both experts' reports were,
and are, fundamental.

23:45.841 --> 23:51.888
First, because they were carried out
by two well-known experts:

23:51.972 --> 23:55.851
Dr. Edward Charles
Alexander Worrall González

23:55.934 --> 23:59.938
and Dr. María Magdalena
Gutiérrez Escudero.

24:00.021 --> 24:01.815
How did the injury occur,

24:01.898 --> 24:05.986
according to the expert
representing the prosecution?

24:06.069 --> 24:10.365
According to the coroner appointed
by the district attorney's office,

24:10.449 --> 24:13.118
the bullet pierced the back of the hand

24:13.201 --> 24:14.870
near the fourth finger.

24:16.371 --> 24:19.040
And it came out through the palm,

24:19.124 --> 24:21.751
by the thenar eminence.

24:21.835 --> 24:23.879
-Here's the exit wound.
-Okay.

24:23.962 --> 24:29.426
That's not what we can see
in Héctor's pictures.

24:29.509 --> 24:34.306
You can see that the wound
with the irregular margins

24:34.389 --> 24:37.350
isn't the one on the palm,
but on the back of the hand.

24:37.434 --> 24:41.771
I thought it was important
to examine Mr. Héctor.

24:41.855 --> 24:45.775
So I asked for permission
to go into the penitentiary

24:45.859 --> 24:48.653
to examine him, and also hear his story.

24:48.737 --> 24:50.614
When I did this,

24:51.114 --> 24:52.407
the bullet went in here.

24:54.117 --> 24:54.951
And came out.

24:55.535 --> 24:57.245
I can see what he says,

24:57.329 --> 25:01.166
that the bullet went in through the side,
near the second finger,

25:01.249 --> 25:05.337
and came out near the fourth finger,
at the back of the hand.

25:05.420 --> 25:08.924
People do this when they see a gun.

25:09.007 --> 25:13.512
Dr. Edward carried out
a reconstruction of the events,

25:13.595 --> 25:18.266
based on what ACP and his son
had declared in their statements,

25:18.350 --> 25:22.479
taken from different documents
in the investigation folder.

25:22.562 --> 25:26.066
He tried to establish if it was possible

25:26.650 --> 25:30.195
that Héctor's hand injury
could have been the result

25:30.278 --> 25:33.240
if the incident had happened
the way they said they had happened.

25:33.323 --> 25:38.828
The reconstruction of the events
will show us which version is true.

25:38.912 --> 25:43.250
If the alleged victim, as he says,
took his gun and shot,

25:43.333 --> 25:50.257
the bullet would follow the trajectory
indicated by the yellow cord.

25:50.340 --> 25:55.220
But the red cord is the one
reflecting the injury his hand shows.

25:55.303 --> 25:58.932
The angles are totally different.
It couldn't have occurred that way.

25:59.015 --> 26:02.394
It's evident that Héctor
raised his hands in defense.

26:02.477 --> 26:04.896
That's why the bullet went through here.

26:04.980 --> 26:09.693
If I'm pointing a gun at you
with my hand like this,

26:10.235 --> 26:12.654
where will the bullet go if you shoot me?

26:12.737 --> 26:14.197
It'll hit here, right?

26:14.781 --> 26:16.741
It can never hit me here.

26:16.825 --> 26:21.913
Because imagine I'm pointing a gun.
Do you get it?

26:21.997 --> 26:23.999
However, the gunshot wound,

26:24.082 --> 26:27.127
as Dr. Magdalena demonstrated very well,

26:27.711 --> 26:30.171
clearly shows, and so do the scars,

26:30.255 --> 26:33.550
that the bullet went in through here
and out through here.

26:33.633 --> 26:38.680
The way the alleged victims described
what happened? Absolutely impossible.

26:38.763 --> 26:39.806
I repeat.

26:39.889 --> 26:43.643
It's impossible it happened like that.

26:44.227 --> 26:46.271
<i>Three, four, thirty, seven, four.</i>

26:47.814 --> 26:48.982
<i>In ten minutes.</i>

26:49.524 --> 26:52.360
<i>In ten minutes, 43211.</i>

26:55.864 --> 26:58.491
We identified ourselves
as municipal police

26:58.575 --> 27:00.952
and asked them to get out of the car.

27:06.416 --> 27:10.754
892 DAYS IN PRISON
POLICE OFFICERS' TESTIMONY

27:12.464 --> 27:14.382
They just went as backup,

27:14.466 --> 27:16.676
to see what had happened.

27:16.760 --> 27:18.553
When the cops got there,

27:19.095 --> 27:21.931
nothing of what ACP had told them

27:22.432 --> 27:23.391
checked out.

27:23.475 --> 27:25.101
Why? Because it wasn't true.

27:25.185 --> 27:28.938
<i>Did you check anything</i>
<i>in regards to the state of the van?</i>

27:29.022 --> 27:30.023
<i>No.</i>

27:30.106 --> 27:33.151
<i>Did you identify or secure</i>
<i>any object inside the van?</i>

27:33.234 --> 27:34.235
<i>No.</i>

27:34.319 --> 27:37.697
<i>Did you ask the gas station</i>
<i>for their security tapes?</i>

27:37.781 --> 27:38.615
<i>No.</i>

27:38.698 --> 27:40.617
<i>And the Oxxo's security tapes?</i>

27:40.700 --> 27:41.534
<i>No.</i>

27:42.619 --> 27:45.372
<i>Did you secure the alleged victim's gun?</i>

27:45.455 --> 27:46.289
<i>No.</i>

27:46.373 --> 27:48.500
<i>Did you secure any other object</i>

27:48.583 --> 27:52.253
<i>besides the Jetta and the gray Ram</i>
<i>allegedly driven by Gonzalo and Juan Luis?</i>

27:52.337 --> 27:53.171
<i>No.</i>

27:53.254 --> 27:55.840
<i>Did you find or identify any bullet case?</i>

27:56.383 --> 27:57.217
<i>No.</i>

27:57.300 --> 27:59.052
<i>Did you take them to Villahermosa?</i>

27:59.928 --> 28:00.929
<i>We were ordered by--</i>

28:01.012 --> 28:02.097
<i>Yes or no, please.</i>

28:02.722 --> 28:03.890
<i>Yes, we did.</i>

28:04.474 --> 28:10.271
<i>Is it true that you were unaware</i>
<i>of the attempted kidnapping of ACP?</i>

28:10.355 --> 28:11.231
<i>Yes, that's true.</i>

28:11.981 --> 28:14.442
<i>You only know what you've been told.</i>

28:14.526 --> 28:15.402
<i>That's right.</i>

28:15.485 --> 28:16.861
<i>No further questions.</i>

28:16.945 --> 28:20.865
The correct procedure would be
that the first officer on the scene

28:20.949 --> 28:26.204
would secure the scene, call someone
to take photos of the evidence,

28:26.287 --> 28:29.165
collect it, file it, keep everything.

28:29.249 --> 28:32.460
They would interview witnesses,
get the security footage.

28:32.544 --> 28:35.004
That's the logical
and standard procedure.

28:35.088 --> 28:36.506
They didn't do any of that.

28:43.638 --> 28:47.308
If a police officer
is properly trained, he will know

28:47.392 --> 28:51.229
how to get over the obstacles
that come up in the investigation.

28:51.312 --> 28:53.940
He'd know how to get data, information,

28:54.023 --> 28:57.986
how to carry out an interrogation,

28:58.069 --> 29:03.533
how to get information without resorting
to violence, pressure or isolation.

29:03.616 --> 29:05.243
In that case, you can say,

29:05.326 --> 29:08.037
"With this training
and these tools I gave you,

29:08.121 --> 29:09.372
get me results."

29:09.456 --> 29:13.585
But if I don't train you,
don't give you tools, fuel, weapons,

29:13.668 --> 29:16.963
and you don't know
how to do a scientific investigation,

29:17.046 --> 29:19.507
you won't be able to deliver results.

29:20.633 --> 29:24.220
They themselves
are victims of abuse by the authorities.

29:24.304 --> 29:28.099
They themselves are victims of abuse
by the prosecutor's office.

29:28.183 --> 29:30.727
They're badly paid and badly fed.

29:30.810 --> 29:34.898
Mexico has one of the highest rates
of crimes against police officers.

29:34.981 --> 29:37.901
About 350 police officers
are killed each year.

29:37.984 --> 29:39.444
Almost one a day.

29:40.904 --> 29:44.115
And those homicides
aren't investigated either.

30:01.132 --> 30:05.261
<i>Good morning.</i>
<i>It's 11:04 on February 26th, 2018.</i>

30:05.345 --> 30:08.389
<i>We're in courtroom two</i>
<i>in the Federal Trial Court</i>

30:08.473 --> 30:10.016
<i>of Macuspana, Tabasco,</i>

30:10.099 --> 30:14.187
<i>to carry out the hearing</i>
<i>of case number 112/2017</i>

30:14.270 --> 30:17.023
<i>involving Mr. Juan Luis López García,</i>

30:17.106 --> 30:19.818
<i>Héctor Muñoz Muñoz</i>
<i>and Gonzalo García Hernández</i>

30:19.901 --> 30:22.153
<i>for the attempted kidnapping</i>

30:22.237 --> 30:26.032
<i>of the victim of undisclosed identity,</i>
<i>with the initials ACP.</i>

30:29.410 --> 30:31.704
STATE POLICE

30:31.788 --> 30:37.627
<i>We will now hear</i>
<i>the prosecutor's opening statement.</i>

30:41.130 --> 30:46.928
ACP'S TESTIMONY
FEBRUARY 26TH, 2018

30:51.099 --> 30:52.892
<i>Life-changing atrocious acts.</i>

30:53.393 --> 30:56.396
<i>Honorable Court, you will hear now</i>

30:56.479 --> 30:59.482
<i>about the event</i>
<i>that has changed this person's life.</i>

30:59.566 --> 31:03.111
<i>This person was a victim</i>
<i>of an attempted kidnapping</i>

31:03.194 --> 31:06.197
<i>when walking the streets</i>
<i>of this municipality.</i>

31:06.281 --> 31:09.909
<i>The crime was committed by the accused.</i>

31:10.827 --> 31:13.413
<i>We will prove their full responsibility</i>

31:13.496 --> 31:15.540
<i>beyond a reasonable doubt</i>

31:15.623 --> 31:18.418
<i>for the attempted kidnapping</i>

31:18.501 --> 31:21.880
<i>of the victim with the initials ACP.</i>

31:24.173 --> 31:25.008
<i>Hello?</i>

31:27.468 --> 31:28.303
<i>Hello?</i>

31:28.761 --> 31:29.804
<i>Good afternoon.</i>

31:30.305 --> 31:31.723
MR. ACP
PROSECUTION WITNESS

31:31.806 --> 31:35.435
<i>Could you tell us your full name?</i>
<i>Sorry, your initials.</i>

31:35.518 --> 31:36.394
<i>ACP.</i>

31:36.978 --> 31:38.396
<i>Good afternoon, witness.</i>

31:38.897 --> 31:39.981
<i>Good afternoon.</i>

31:40.064 --> 31:42.066
<i>Please state your age.</i>

31:42.150 --> 31:43.818
<i>I'm 67 years old.</i>

31:43.902 --> 31:46.279
<i>State your level of education.</i>

31:47.739 --> 31:49.449
<i>Sixth grade. Primary school.</i>

31:51.117 --> 31:52.660
<i>Please state for the court</i>

31:52.744 --> 31:56.831
<i>what your testimony will be about.</i>

31:58.082 --> 32:03.421
<i>It will be about what happened</i>
<i>on June 20th, 2015.</i>

32:08.051 --> 32:12.931
DAY OF THE ARREST
JUNE 20TH, 2015

32:27.570 --> 32:30.990
<i>At about 10:00 a.m., my son called me.</i>

32:31.491 --> 32:33.993
<i>I called him about a client with an issue.</i>

32:34.077 --> 32:35.161
ACC
PROSECUTION WITNESS

32:35.244 --> 32:37.121
<i>He said he'd take care of it.</i>

32:37.205 --> 32:43.252
<i>And I also told him</i>
<i>there was a suspicious van.</i>

32:45.463 --> 32:48.633
<i>I got to the store</i>
<i>about half an hour later.</i>

32:49.342 --> 32:53.471
<i>At that point, I saw there was a vehicle</i>

32:53.554 --> 32:56.683
<i>parked in front</i>
<i>of Mr. Antonio's convenience store.</i>

33:01.813 --> 33:06.359
<i>At 2:00 p.m., patrol car 027 arrived.</i>

33:06.442 --> 33:12.156
<i>The police officers told us</i>
<i>the van had apparently broken down.</i>

33:12.699 --> 33:15.410
<i>But we knew it wasn't true,</i>

33:15.493 --> 33:19.038
<i>because they started it</i>
<i>and slowly drove past our store,</i>

33:19.122 --> 33:20.206
<i>looking at us.</i>

33:24.168 --> 33:26.254
<i>We closed the store,</i>

33:26.337 --> 33:28.673
<i>and assumed they had already gone.</i>

33:28.756 --> 33:30.842
<i>We drove slowly to Ciudad Pemex.</i>

33:36.222 --> 33:40.560
<i>Suddenly, near the church,</i>
<i>two cars stopped.</i>

33:41.936 --> 33:43.771
<i>They blocked our way</i>

33:43.855 --> 33:46.482
<i>and I managed to maneuver past them.</i>

33:46.566 --> 33:50.486
<i>We hit two speed bumps fast,</i>
<i>and they kept driving behind us.</i>

33:50.570 --> 33:53.823
<i>He saw the two cars</i>
<i>had hit the speed bump too,</i>

33:53.906 --> 33:55.241
<i>and said, "There's trouble."</i>

33:55.825 --> 33:58.202
<i>Fifty meters before the gas station,</i>

33:58.286 --> 34:00.788
<i>I couldn't continue</i>
<i>because the van blocked my way</i>

34:00.872 --> 34:03.458
<i>and the two cars caught up with me.</i>

34:03.541 --> 34:08.254
<i>The driver of the Jetta took his hand out</i>
<i>and pointed at me with a gun.</i>

34:08.755 --> 34:11.424
<i>He bumped into my car</i>
<i>and I was forced to stop.</i>

34:13.051 --> 34:16.637
<i>He got out of the car,</i>
<i>and I saw he had a gun.</i>

34:17.263 --> 34:21.350
<i>That's when I reached for my .22 pistol.</i>

34:21.434 --> 34:23.978
<i>When he stuck his hand through the window,</i>

34:24.062 --> 34:25.813
<i>my reaction was to shoot.</i>

34:29.150 --> 34:32.487
<i>The patrol car got there</i>
<i>and talked to Mr. ACP.</i>

34:33.112 --> 34:37.241
<i>They pointed at the van, and the guys</i>
<i>pretended it had broken down,</i>

34:37.325 --> 34:39.952
<i>but I saw they were up to something.</i>

34:41.913 --> 34:44.957
<i>So Mr. ACP pointed at the guys in the van</i>

34:45.875 --> 34:47.293
<i>and they were arrested.</i>

34:52.799 --> 34:54.675
The story is very clear

34:54.759 --> 34:58.971
if we keep in mind
Mrs. GLP was kidnapped on May 26th.

34:59.680 --> 35:03.434
After that, her brother
is the victim of an attempted kidnapping.

35:03.976 --> 35:06.354
And after that, an incident takes place

35:06.938 --> 35:11.526
in which ACP,
after the situations he's gone through,

35:11.609 --> 35:13.903
understanding his mental state,

35:14.403 --> 35:18.574
sees that,
because of a minor car accident,

35:18.658 --> 35:21.160
someone gets out of a car carrying pliers,

35:21.244 --> 35:24.747
as Héctor has honestly confirmed,
to start a fight.

35:24.831 --> 35:26.958
So ACP reacts.

35:27.041 --> 35:30.920
I just said to him,
"Look what you did, motherfucker."

35:31.754 --> 35:34.465
I yelled at him two or three times.

35:35.049 --> 35:37.260
He bent over in his van,

35:37.844 --> 35:39.220
and pointed a gun at me.

35:41.097 --> 35:42.807
When we understand the context,

35:42.890 --> 35:48.688
we understand why things
happened as we said they did.

35:48.771 --> 35:50.022
And that's the truth.

35:51.440 --> 35:52.567
<i>Mr. ACP,</i>

35:53.234 --> 35:57.989
<i>was the van you found suspicious</i>
<i>and was allegedly watching you</i>

35:58.573 --> 36:01.117
<i>parked there from 10:00 a.m. to 2:00 p.m.?</i>

36:02.285 --> 36:05.413
<i>I don't know.</i>
<i>I have other information now…</i>

36:05.496 --> 36:08.583
<i>-Yes or no, please, Mr. ACP.</i>
<i>-Yes.</i>

36:08.666 --> 36:12.128
I never even saw Mr. ACP's store.

36:12.211 --> 36:16.841
Apparently, it was on our right,
across the street from where we were.

36:17.383 --> 36:21.804
We didn't care who owned that store
or who lived next door.

36:22.722 --> 36:25.766
I just didn't want my engine to burn out.

36:25.850 --> 36:29.312
<i>When the person driving the Jetta</i>
<i>got out of the car,</i>

36:29.812 --> 36:31.022
<i>what did he say?</i>

36:31.105 --> 36:32.440
<i>Objection, Your Honor.</i>

36:32.523 --> 36:35.526
<i>One moment, please. On what grounds?</i>

36:35.610 --> 36:39.572
<i>The witness hasn't stated</i>
<i>he had communication with that person.</i>

36:39.655 --> 36:41.657
<i>The prosecution is adding information.</i>

36:47.330 --> 36:49.123
<i>The answer is reconsidered.</i>

36:49.207 --> 36:51.709
<i>The question is, indeed, suggestive,</i>

36:51.792 --> 36:54.337
<i>therefore, it shall not be accepted.</i>

36:55.087 --> 36:59.050
<i>Did the individuals blocking your way</i>
<i>say something to you?</i>

36:59.133 --> 37:00.343
<i>Objection, Your Honor.</i>

37:00.426 --> 37:01.344
<i>Yes, they did.</i>

37:01.427 --> 37:02.678
<i>One moment.</i>

37:02.762 --> 37:04.096
<i>He answered already.</i>

37:04.180 --> 37:07.266
<i>Please, witness, I ask you again,</i>

37:07.350 --> 37:10.853
<i>do not answer so quickly.</i>
<i>Do you understand?</i>

37:10.937 --> 37:11.938
<i>Yes.</i>

37:12.438 --> 37:15.483
<i>The prosecution</i>
<i>is introducing new information,</i>

37:15.566 --> 37:17.235
<i>asking suggestive questions,</i>

37:17.318 --> 37:21.197
<i>and, the witness,</i>
<i>following their lead, is answering</i>

37:21.280 --> 37:25.117
<i>what the prosecution wants to introduce</i>
<i>illegally in this trial.</i>

37:25.201 --> 37:28.621
<i>I believe his answers are spontaneous.</i>

37:28.704 --> 37:30.081
<i>You can answer.</i>

37:30.164 --> 37:34.168
<i>Tell the court what they said to you.</i>

37:34.252 --> 37:35.962
<i>I'll repeat it.</i>

37:36.045 --> 37:39.674
<i>The driver of the green Jetta</i>…

37:40.424 --> 37:43.386
<i>He stuck his hand out of the window.</i>

37:44.262 --> 37:45.930
<i>He was holding a gun.</i>

37:47.098 --> 37:49.892
<i>He said,</i>
<i>"It's over for you, motherfucker!"</i>

37:49.976 --> 37:51.644
<i>"This is a kidnapping."</i>

37:51.727 --> 37:54.981
The witness,
after hearing the question 50 times,

37:55.064 --> 37:56.607
even though we objected,

37:56.691 --> 38:00.319
understood the prosecution
wanted him to say the phrase,

38:00.403 --> 38:02.029
"This is a kidnapping."

38:02.113 --> 38:04.740
That was the only evidence
they could present

38:04.824 --> 38:08.077
in relation to the subjective element
of the kidnapping.

38:08.160 --> 38:10.663
Without it, there was no crime.

38:10.746 --> 38:12.581
NOTIFICATION OF PROBABLE CRIMES

38:12.665 --> 38:16.419
ACP testified four times
about the gas station incident.

38:16.502 --> 38:20.923
One of those testimonies
was on the very same day of the incident,

38:21.007 --> 38:22.883
June 20th, 2015.

38:23.426 --> 38:29.015
He said you were driving a green Jetta,

38:29.098 --> 38:30.725
pointed a gun at him

38:30.808 --> 38:34.729
and said, "It's over for you,
motherfucker. This is a kidnapping."

38:34.812 --> 38:37.940
ACP went
to the national prosecutor's office

38:38.524 --> 38:40.484
and told the district attorneys,

38:41.152 --> 38:44.238
"I thought their intention
was to kidnap me."

38:50.619 --> 38:51.746
He thought…

38:51.829 --> 38:52.913
He thought.

38:55.291 --> 38:59.170
You are here
essentially because of ACP's statement.

39:00.463 --> 39:02.631
Here are photos from the police lineup.

39:02.715 --> 39:03.716
There we are.

39:08.387 --> 39:11.557
But instead of using
the police lineup to see

39:11.640 --> 39:14.560
if a witness or victim can identify you,

39:15.144 --> 39:18.564
they are only doing it
to take the picture.

39:18.647 --> 39:20.691
-Yes.
-To construct your guilt.

39:20.775 --> 39:25.404
Not to see if the witness
actually identifies someone.

39:25.488 --> 39:29.617
Since someone pointed at you here,
they can issue an order for arrest.

39:31.494 --> 39:35.539
With that order, they can throw this away.
They don't need it anymore.

39:36.123 --> 39:40.127
It's a matter of matching
the people you have detained

39:40.211 --> 39:41.295
for any reason

39:42.463 --> 39:45.800
to whatever crime
you are trying to supposedly "solve."

39:46.342 --> 39:49.095
How many innocent people
have ended up here

39:49.178 --> 39:50.763
accused of kidnapping?

39:51.347 --> 39:54.225
They are detained for something, released,

39:54.308 --> 39:56.560
and then arrested for something else.

39:56.644 --> 39:58.646
Most guys are here for kidnapping.

40:23.170 --> 40:26.465
1110 DAYS IN PRISON
EXPERTS' TESTIMONY

40:30.928 --> 40:33.139
<i>Good afternoon. Please, state your name.</i>

40:33.222 --> 40:35.474
<i>Good afternoon.</i>
<i>Luis Antonio Rodríguez Ceballos.</i>

40:35.558 --> 40:37.643
<i>Mr. Luis Antonio Rodríguez Ceballos</i>

40:37.726 --> 40:40.855
<i>has credentials</i>
<i>issued by the prosecutor's office</i>

40:40.938 --> 40:43.357
<i>signed by Dr. Fernando Valenzuela Pernas.</i>

40:43.441 --> 40:45.860
<i>He is a qualified coroner.</i>

40:45.943 --> 40:49.196
<i>-Where do you work?</i>
<i>-In the district attorney's office.</i>

40:49.280 --> 40:53.492
<i>Do you recognize any of these men?</i>
<i>Did you examine any of them that day?</i>

40:54.160 --> 40:56.328
<i>I remember examining him.</i>

40:56.412 --> 40:59.999
<i>Did you observe any injuries</i>
<i>on Héctor Muñoz Muñoz's body?</i>

41:00.082 --> 41:01.000
<i>Yes.</i>

41:01.083 --> 41:05.421
<i>Could you tell us where</i>
<i>the entrance and the exit wounds were?</i>

41:08.090 --> 41:11.635
<i>According to what you said,</i>
<i>it entered through the metacarpus</i>

41:11.719 --> 41:14.930
<i>and exited through the palm,</i>
<i>where exactly?</i>

41:15.014 --> 41:18.517
<i>The bullet hit the back of the hand,</i>
<i>fourth metacarpal bone,</i>

41:18.601 --> 41:20.561
<i>and exited through the thenar eminence.</i>

41:21.937 --> 41:23.522
<i>Could you also tell us</i>

41:24.940 --> 41:27.693
<i>the size of these injuries?</i>

41:27.776 --> 41:29.069
<i>I don't remember now.</i>

41:29.153 --> 41:29.987
<i>You don't?</i>

41:30.488 --> 41:34.074
<i>The bone fragments, when they come out,</i>

41:34.158 --> 41:36.952
<i>open up the skin.</i>

41:37.536 --> 41:42.249
<i>Therefore, the exit wound</i>
<i>tends to have a bigger diameter.</i>

41:44.251 --> 41:46.337
<i>Specialist, I mean, doctor,</i>

41:46.420 --> 41:49.423
<i>do you have credentials</i>
<i>as a medical forensics expert?</i>

41:49.507 --> 41:52.384
<i>Objection, Your Honor.</i>
<i>The question is confusing.</i>

41:52.468 --> 41:56.180
<i>There are no professional credentials</i>
<i>specifically for experts.</i>

41:56.263 --> 41:58.891
<i>There are credentials</i>
<i>for bachelor's degrees,</i>

41:58.974 --> 42:01.185
<i>master's degrees,</i>
<i>specializations and doctorates.</i>

42:01.810 --> 42:07.441
<i>The wound does not match up</i>
<i>with the events reported.</i>

42:07.942 --> 42:09.068
<i>Reported by who?</i>

42:09.735 --> 42:11.904
<i>By ACP and ACC.</i>

42:11.987 --> 42:15.032
<i>Can you tell us why</i>
<i>you did not request Mr. ACP's van</i>

42:15.115 --> 42:18.702
<i>for the reconstruction of events,</i>
<i>so it would be more accurate?</i>

42:18.786 --> 42:21.121
<i>I don't have that ability, sir.</i>

42:21.205 --> 42:25.584
<i>So the reconstruction of events</i>
<i>wasn't exactly like the circumstances?</i>

42:25.668 --> 42:28.504
<i>Objection.</i>
<i>The question is obscure and conclusive.</i>

42:28.587 --> 42:29.421
<i>Sustained.</i>

42:29.505 --> 42:32.508
The fact that
he didn't use the same exact vehicle,

42:32.591 --> 42:35.135
or the sun wasn't in the same position,

42:35.219 --> 42:38.264
or the same bird
wasn't perched on the same branch

42:38.347 --> 42:40.307
doesn't invalidate the assessment.

42:40.391 --> 42:42.851
-That was their idea.
-They tried it.

42:42.935 --> 42:46.272
My testimony wasn't put in doubt.
It stood firm.

42:46.355 --> 42:48.857
I think the court understood my point.

42:48.941 --> 42:50.359
I think so too.

42:50.442 --> 42:53.362
-Let's hope the verdict reflects that.
-Right.

42:53.445 --> 42:56.949
Because, at the end of the day,
there's no other…

42:58.158 --> 42:59.618
objective evidence,

42:59.702 --> 43:04.456
besides the one we presented,
that reflects what happened.

43:04.540 --> 43:06.250
-They didn't do anything.
-No.

43:19.263 --> 43:21.890
After a long day's work,

43:21.974 --> 43:24.768
we left in two of my vans.

43:24.852 --> 43:29.023
Myself, Edward and Magdalena were in one.

43:29.106 --> 43:33.736
In my other van were my wife
and my four-year-old daughter.

43:33.819 --> 43:34.778
Suddenly,

43:35.362 --> 43:37.364
the van just stopped.

43:39.658 --> 43:42.036
When we got out, barely 20 seconds later,

43:42.119 --> 43:44.955
the truck went up in flames.

43:54.298 --> 43:56.258
Don't get any closer.

43:59.637 --> 44:02.681
<i>Roberto, please call me</i>
<i>as soon as you can.</i>

44:02.765 --> 44:05.267
<i>Something very serious happened.</i>

44:05.976 --> 44:09.480
<i>Edward was driving one of my vans,</i>
<i>I was in the other one,</i>

44:09.563 --> 44:12.483
<i>and suddenly, out of nowhere,</i>

44:12.983 --> 44:14.735
<i>it went up in flames.</i>

44:15.235 --> 44:17.446
<i>We believe it's sabotage.</i>

44:17.529 --> 44:19.323
<i>So it's terrible, really.</i>

44:19.948 --> 44:21.909
<i>The damn extinguisher was useless.</i>

44:21.992 --> 44:25.245
<i>Now the van is on fire</i>
<i>and the tank is about to explode.</i>

44:25.329 --> 44:27.873
<i>It's pretty bad. We already called 911.</i>

44:28.916 --> 44:30.501
Okay, thank you.

44:31.877 --> 44:33.879
Andrés believes

44:35.047 --> 44:37.716
this was a homicide attempt.

44:38.550 --> 44:42.596
Because the van almost blew up.

44:42.680 --> 44:44.556
It burst into flames.

46:48.305 --> 46:53.310
