WEBVTT

00:06.273 --> 00:07.641
Previously on Heels...

00:07.675 --> 00:10.277
Right over there,
we're gonna have three people

00:10.311 --> 00:12.213
from the South Georgia
State Fair Commission.

00:12.246 --> 00:15.449
If they like what they see,
about a month from now,

00:15.483 --> 00:19.487
y'all are gonna be performing
for 10,000 folks.

00:21.622 --> 00:25.593
Jack's ego is gonna be
the downfall of the DWL.

00:25.626 --> 00:26.727
Your life ain't so perfect.

00:26.761 --> 00:29.397
And that daughter
you can't fuckin' stand--

00:29.430 --> 00:32.566
too bad I wasn't around to pay
for that abortion too.

00:32.600 --> 00:33.734
Tricia's my new valet.

00:33.768 --> 00:35.069
Why are you doing this?

00:35.102 --> 00:36.604
It's nothing personal.
It's business.

00:36.637 --> 00:38.072
Now, before we get started,

00:38.105 --> 00:40.274
I got something important
I wanna--

00:40.307 --> 00:42.076
I have a confession to make.

00:42.109 --> 00:44.044
I been cheatin' on you
with Bobby Pin.

00:48.416 --> 00:50.751
You do not get
to change things.

00:50.785 --> 00:52.620
-Hey! Hey!

00:54.688 --> 00:58.058
Ace has just
injured a fellow wrestler.

00:58.092 --> 00:59.493
And that's why I challenge

00:59.527 --> 01:00.828
-Jack and Ace...
-Motherfucker.

01:01.061 --> 01:04.198
...for the DWL
championship belt

01:04.231 --> 01:05.833
in a three-way ladder match.

01:07.067 --> 01:11.071
Willie, we got the fair.

02:44.865 --> 02:46.667
And the score's
gone final in St. Louis,

02:46.700 --> 02:50.371
15 to three, the Braves
losing to the Cardinals

02:50.404 --> 02:52.172
for the third night in a row.

02:52.206 --> 02:54.208
We'll send it to Ted
in the studio

02:54.241 --> 02:56.277
for all the lowlights
from this one

02:56.310 --> 02:57.645
-after these message--

02:58.779 --> 03:01.315
Yo, do me a favor.
Can you finish up that hallway?

03:01.348 --> 03:02.750
Yeah, yeah, I got it.

03:04.184 --> 03:05.920
Jack wrestled well tonight.

03:07.488 --> 03:09.256
Man, we are losing money.

03:09.290 --> 03:11.358
We are losing
so much fuckin' money.

03:15.529 --> 03:17.431
I'm such a fuckin' failure.

03:18.632 --> 03:21.902
You built an incredible place
where so many people find joy.

03:21.936 --> 03:23.571
Not anymore.

03:25.406 --> 03:27.841
It ain't how
you played the game, Willie.

03:27.875 --> 03:30.411
It's the score at the end.

03:30.444 --> 03:32.980
Check the scoreboard,
what's it say?

03:33.213 --> 03:35.416
Says I fuckin' lost.

03:52.499 --> 03:54.602
I still struggle
with the realization

03:54.635 --> 03:56.403
that I have to integrate
the damage

03:56.437 --> 03:58.606
of the mistakes
of my former life,

03:58.639 --> 04:01.742
the drinking life,
the things I said and did,

04:01.775 --> 04:04.845
with the day-to-day
good guy living and striving

04:04.878 --> 04:07.748
I got to do now
without hating myself.

04:07.781 --> 04:09.883
Because the yearning
and the hopeful

04:09.917 --> 04:13.320
and achieving me, knows
all about his mistakes,

04:13.354 --> 04:15.322
still got to do stuff.

04:15.356 --> 04:18.792
Can't be weighed down
constantly so I'm useless.

04:18.826 --> 04:21.495
But my tendency is
to misremember my mistakes

04:21.528 --> 04:23.263
or make like
they weren't as impactful

04:23.297 --> 04:24.732
'cause they don't fit
the current mold of me

04:24.765 --> 04:27.034
being a good dude.

04:27.267 --> 04:31.372
Thing is, if I forget them,
diminish them,

04:31.405 --> 04:33.607
if I don't use them as,
you know,

04:33.641 --> 04:35.843
fertilizer for a better me,

04:35.876 --> 04:39.713
I'm liable to revert
to the same terrible impulses,

04:39.747 --> 04:41.715
same terrible outcomes.

04:44.652 --> 04:47.021
Have gratitude
for your regrets.

04:47.054 --> 04:48.922
They're there to remind you

04:48.956 --> 04:51.291
to be a better version
of yourself.

04:58.065 --> 05:01.535
After leader shares,
we have anniversaries.

05:01.568 --> 05:03.937
Today we have one,

05:03.971 --> 05:07.474
and Diane has one year.

05:07.508 --> 05:09.710
-Let's go, Diane!
-Diane, come on!

05:09.743 --> 05:11.078
-Let's go, Diane!
-Yes!

05:11.311 --> 05:14.314
Let's go, Diane!
Let's go, Diane!

05:14.348 --> 05:18.085
Let's go, Diane!
Let's go, Diane!

05:18.318 --> 05:21.321
Let's go, Diane!
Let's go, Diane!

05:21.355 --> 05:23.090
Let's go, Diane!

05:50.818 --> 05:52.686
Hey, Jack,
it's Constance Garrity

05:52.720 --> 05:54.688
from the South Georgia
State Fair Commission.

05:54.722 --> 05:55.889
I wanted to get your thoughts

05:55.923 --> 05:57.958
on how we might
increase ticket sales

05:57.991 --> 05:59.927
for the appearance of the DWL.

05:59.960 --> 06:02.062
Preshow sales
are tracking way behind

06:02.096 --> 06:03.430
from where we were last year

06:03.464 --> 06:05.599
for both
"The Houdini Extravaganza"

06:05.632 --> 06:07.134
and the "Second City Circus."

06:07.367 --> 06:08.502
So not to be alarmed,

06:08.535 --> 06:09.737
people do love magic
and the circus,

06:09.770 --> 06:11.438
but we'd really
like to connect

06:11.472 --> 06:12.539
on how to goose ticket sales,

06:12.573 --> 06:14.141
so when you get a chance,

06:14.374 --> 06:16.376
could you give me a call
so we can scheme?

06:16.410 --> 06:18.412
I'm not worried yet,
but I'm getting there.

06:18.445 --> 06:20.614
Okay, thank you.
Have a great day.

06:34.394 --> 06:36.563
-Goddamn keys.

06:36.597 --> 06:37.731
Mornin'.

06:39.767 --> 06:41.735
Every single day.

06:43.837 --> 06:45.839
Jack, check your coat out here.

06:50.544 --> 06:51.879
I got these Tile things

06:51.912 --> 06:53.580
so when keys seem lost,
they aren't really.

06:53.614 --> 06:54.915
Hey, come hear my song
for Baby Shelby.

06:54.948 --> 06:56.116
Uh, can it-can it wait
for tonight?

06:56.150 --> 06:57.584
-I gotta work.
-Well, that'll be the encore

06:57.618 --> 06:59.787
since you're gonna hear it
today at her baptism.

06:59.820 --> 07:02.556
It's on your phone calendar.
There's a barbecue after.

07:02.589 --> 07:04.424
Don't worry,
I already got a present.

07:04.458 --> 07:06.026
I gotta meet Willie.
I gotta do a podcast.

07:06.059 --> 07:07.027
Postpone Willie.

07:07.060 --> 07:08.195
I can't. She called in a favor.

07:08.428 --> 07:09.763
Postpone the podcast.

07:09.797 --> 07:12.199
I gotta sell 10,000 tickets
to a state fair,

07:12.432 --> 07:14.168
and I needed to get it done,
like, yesterday.

07:14.201 --> 07:15.602
Dad, wanna practice cornhole?

07:15.636 --> 07:16.670
They're gonna have it
at the party.

07:16.703 --> 07:17.738
Uh, you know what, buddy?

07:17.771 --> 07:19.473
I gotta work, but at the party,

07:19.506 --> 07:21.475
you and I are gonna take on
all comers, okay?

07:21.508 --> 07:22.943
-Get it.
-Okay.

07:22.976 --> 07:25.145
Ace is Baby Shelby's
godfather.

07:25.179 --> 07:27.214
First song I wrote since
our wedding song, by the way.

07:27.447 --> 07:28.615
I will be there.

07:28.649 --> 07:30.818
I will hear your song,
and I will bite my tongue

07:30.851 --> 07:32.586
when Ace promises
to reject the devil

07:32.619 --> 07:34.188
on Baby Shelby's behalf.

07:34.221 --> 07:36.223
Did you pack
proper church clothes?

07:37.958 --> 07:40.160
I can't cancel this podcast.
Nice toss, buddy.

07:40.194 --> 07:42.930
This guy Dick Valentino's
coming in from Atlanta.

07:42.963 --> 07:44.498
Podcast has huge numbers.

07:44.531 --> 07:46.500
He'd trash me
if I blew him off.

07:46.533 --> 07:47.935
Jack, do what you gotta do.

07:47.968 --> 07:49.503
Just remember,
for the people who love you,

07:49.536 --> 07:51.939
all you really gotta do
is show up on their big days.

07:51.972 --> 07:53.974
Being on time helps,
but blowin' them off doesn't.

07:55.108 --> 07:56.210
Okay.

08:07.654 --> 08:08.922
Thanks for starting
without me.

08:08.956 --> 08:10.958
Sorry, man. I just got a text.

08:10.991 --> 08:12.826
I gotta be elsewhere
in about an hour.

08:12.860 --> 08:14.094
-Mm.
-Morning, sir.

08:14.127 --> 08:15.195
-Something to drink?
-Yeah, let me get

08:15.229 --> 08:17.231
a Diet Coke
with a lemon, please.

08:17.264 --> 08:19.566
No worries, I have to get back
to a christening, anyway.

08:19.600 --> 08:22.069
Oh, nice, man.
World needs more believers.

08:22.102 --> 08:23.237
I believe that I am building

08:23.270 --> 08:24.671
an independent
wrestling promotion

08:24.705 --> 08:26.139
that has no equal.

08:26.173 --> 08:28.675
I'm on my way.
I want you on that way.

08:29.743 --> 08:32.980
Okay, well, I haven't seen you
around the DWL in a while.

08:33.013 --> 08:34.047
I got YouTube.

08:34.081 --> 08:35.115
I got it right here
on my phone.

08:35.148 --> 08:36.583
Plenty of DWL clips

08:36.617 --> 08:38.018
that prove that you're
their best wrestler.

08:38.051 --> 08:39.987
Apocalypse is pretty damn good.

08:40.020 --> 08:42.189
Jack has nobody who can
meet your kind of skills.

08:43.190 --> 08:45.225
Jack is a dictator,
but he is legit good,

08:45.259 --> 08:46.860
and Ace was being scouted
for a reason.

08:46.894 --> 08:48.095
Oh, Ace.

08:48.128 --> 08:49.796
Ace is just a tall blond bro

08:49.830 --> 08:51.698
that dumb women
wanna fuck, okay?

08:51.732 --> 08:53.734
Fuckability's
got a short shelf life.

08:53.767 --> 08:56.169
Take it from somebody who's
gotta rub testosterone gel

08:56.203 --> 08:58.171
into his armpits every morning.

08:59.106 --> 09:00.073
Thank you.

09:00.107 --> 09:01.975
The DWL
is on a respirator, pal.

09:02.009 --> 09:03.143
And fuck Jack.

09:03.176 --> 09:05.112
Why do you wanna
end Jack so bad?

09:05.145 --> 09:06.847
Because I don't like
when people talk shit

09:06.880 --> 09:07.948
about my promotion.

09:07.981 --> 09:10.317
It actually affects
my promotion.

09:10.550 --> 09:13.754
So I get it.
You're after me to get to him.

09:13.787 --> 09:17.057
No, I'm after you because
my audience will eat you up.

09:17.090 --> 09:19.059
Oh, you are laying it on
pretty thick.

09:19.092 --> 09:20.594
Dude, you know what I know?

09:20.627 --> 09:24.598
You should be a star.
And right now, you aren't one.

09:24.631 --> 09:27.968
Now, again, I apologize.
I'm sorry I made this so brief.

09:28.001 --> 09:30.103
Thank you for coming, out.

09:30.137 --> 09:31.338
Money talks.

09:31.571 --> 09:32.940
Bullshit does too.

09:32.973 --> 09:35.309
Why don't you come wrestle
with me in Jacksonville

09:35.342 --> 09:38.845
and decide for yourself whether
my bullshit is worth your time?

09:38.879 --> 09:41.815
Because Jack's hasn't been.
Won't ever be.

09:44.718 --> 09:45.786
Thank you so much.

09:53.994 --> 09:55.329
-Gully.
-Yeah?

09:57.631 --> 10:00.167
Opportunity is
opportunity and money is money,

10:00.200 --> 10:01.601
but if you ever drop cash on me

10:01.635 --> 10:02.769
like I'm some B-team stripper
from Follies,

10:02.803 --> 10:04.137
I promise you a dance
with the devil

10:04.171 --> 10:06.673
that your ass won't be around
to leave the fuckin' tip.

10:06.707 --> 10:07.941
Jesus Christ!

10:07.975 --> 10:09.910
Don't whip up some
imaginary disrespect thing

10:09.943 --> 10:11.345
when I came here
to tell you you're great

10:11.378 --> 10:14.614
and I threw $1,000 on the table
to indicate my interest.

10:14.648 --> 10:16.984
I don't go to strip clubs
because I respect women,

10:17.017 --> 10:19.353
so I don't know how they
throw money around down there.

10:19.386 --> 10:22.089
But if you come work for me,
I will put all your money

10:22.122 --> 10:23.890
in a big fuckin'
manila envelope,

10:23.924 --> 10:26.093
I will wrap it in a bow,
and I will show you loyalty

10:26.126 --> 10:28.028
the likes of which
you've never seen before.

10:28.061 --> 10:29.663
But don't tough guy me.

10:29.696 --> 10:31.698
Doesn't take muscles to be
an effective tough guy.

10:31.732 --> 10:32.899
Just takes a quick temper

10:32.933 --> 10:35.135
and a big family
to back you up.

10:35.168 --> 10:39.706
And on that, the Irish, we got
a massive fuckin' head start.

10:41.174 --> 10:42.676
Pick that shit up, Kevin.

10:44.911 --> 10:45.946
Let's go!

10:50.751 --> 10:53.186
You got my number! Call me!

10:59.059 --> 11:00.160
Hey, I owe you one, Randy.

11:00.193 --> 11:01.828
You got it.

11:01.862 --> 11:03.030
Clearly, the setup

11:03.063 --> 11:04.264
for the state fair
will be different,

11:04.297 --> 11:06.867
but this is
what 10,000 looks like.

11:06.900 --> 11:08.268
This is why
we drove out here, Willie?

11:08.301 --> 11:10.303
We drove out here
to discreetly obtain

11:10.337 --> 11:12.739
South Georgia University's
alumni email list.

11:12.773 --> 11:14.207
You were late. I was not.

11:14.241 --> 11:15.842
How much Randy
hustle you for this?

11:15.876 --> 11:17.177
Nothing. He likes me.

11:17.210 --> 11:19.346
Not much as I do.
Thank you.

11:19.379 --> 11:21.348
We can fill it. I'll make sure.

11:21.381 --> 11:22.916
You gotta decide
about Bill.

11:22.949 --> 11:25.085
Don't really have
much of a choice.

11:25.118 --> 11:27.454
I mean,
you always have a choice.

11:27.687 --> 11:30.424
He cut a promo in our ring
like he was a goddamn plant.

11:30.457 --> 11:31.925
Biggest pop I've heard
in the Dome

11:31.958 --> 11:33.727
in the past fuckin' century,
and if you tell me

11:33.760 --> 11:35.862
how to walk that one back,
I'm all ears.

11:35.896 --> 11:37.397
Okay, well, I don't know
how you walk it forward.

11:37.431 --> 11:38.932
What the hell, Jack?

11:38.965 --> 11:40.867
Bill sneaks in the ring
and now he's running things?

11:40.901 --> 11:42.869
When's the last time
he wrestled?

11:42.903 --> 11:44.171
He's dangerous, Jack.

11:44.204 --> 11:46.039
He's a drunk and a pill popper
and a terrible human

11:46.073 --> 11:48.075
I told you I don't want
anywhere near us.

11:48.108 --> 11:50.243
Your dad would never
take this gamble.

11:50.277 --> 11:51.411
My dad built a Coliseum

11:51.445 --> 11:54.214
that was so goddamn expensive
that he buckled.

11:54.247 --> 11:55.315
-Yeah, okay, well--
-Right?

11:55.348 --> 11:56.750
He left me
holding the bag, right?

11:56.783 --> 11:57.818
And now I'm trying to fix

11:57.851 --> 11:58.985
-what he fucked up.
-I wasn't--

11:59.019 --> 11:59.986
And thank you very much
for bringing up

12:00.020 --> 12:01.054
my dad for a second.

12:01.088 --> 12:02.756
If we're gonna
talk about pride and ego

12:02.789 --> 12:03.890
and all the different ways

12:03.924 --> 12:05.959
that the DWL never became
what he wanted,

12:05.992 --> 12:08.061
why do you think that was?

12:08.095 --> 12:09.362
Do you think it was
a world-class allergy

12:09.396 --> 12:10.831
towards input?

12:10.864 --> 12:12.933
Right, because I-I think
that my dad's Achilles' heel

12:12.966 --> 12:13.934
was more along the lines

12:13.967 --> 12:15.936
of a reflexive
fuckin' readiness

12:15.969 --> 12:20.474
to wallow in self-pity anytime
anyone hurt his feelings.

12:20.507 --> 12:22.209
Now say that
like you've thought about it.

12:25.779 --> 12:29.316
Tom was complicated,
but Tom was a great man.

12:29.349 --> 12:31.017
Look, he built something
out of nothing,

12:31.051 --> 12:32.352
and it launched Bill.

12:32.385 --> 12:34.087
And Bill barely ever even
acknowledged what your dad

12:34.121 --> 12:36.456
and the DWL did for him
despite getting his start here.

12:36.490 --> 12:38.992
More than a start.
Bill could never show up.

12:39.025 --> 12:41.528
Not for one night, not for one
fuckin' exhibition to chip off

12:41.761 --> 12:44.865
just a little piece of his fame
for us while we struggled.

12:44.898 --> 12:45.966
Bill forgot us.

12:45.999 --> 12:47.100
But now, in the midst

12:47.134 --> 12:48.502
of his well-fuckin'-earned
desperation,

12:48.535 --> 12:51.037
he wants to help us
and you wanna bank on him?

12:51.071 --> 12:52.873
You wanna fuckin' rely on Bill?

12:52.906 --> 12:53.907
Bill Hancock's
the only wrestler

12:53.940 --> 12:55.008
who ever came out of Duffy

12:55.041 --> 12:56.376
and made a fuckin' name
for himself.

12:56.409 --> 12:59.479
And now we can use him
to build back up the league

12:59.513 --> 13:01.781
to make it what we want,
what my dad wanted.

13:01.815 --> 13:03.250
So we just forgive and forget?

13:03.283 --> 13:05.919
Nobody said forgive.
Nobody said forget.

13:05.952 --> 13:07.387
I'm trying to do business here,

13:07.420 --> 13:08.922
and you were the one
who told me to ask Bill

13:08.955 --> 13:10.423
for help
and take my emotions out of it.

13:10.457 --> 13:11.958
So which one is it, Willie?

13:11.992 --> 13:14.794
Your dad saw the potential
in Bill as a wrestler.

13:14.828 --> 13:17.164
I saw the potential
in Bill as a person.

13:18.798 --> 13:20.100
Your dad was right. I wasn't.

13:22.802 --> 13:24.571
I told you what he said to me.

13:24.804 --> 13:26.540
I told Ace our dad knew
he was home

13:26.573 --> 13:28.175
when he shot himself.

13:28.208 --> 13:31.344
Ace told me I was gonna
kill myself just like our dad.

13:31.378 --> 13:33.280
People say stupid shit, Willie.

13:33.313 --> 13:35.282
We're-we're in the business

13:35.315 --> 13:37.083
of bringing entertainment
to the masses,

13:37.117 --> 13:40.954
and Bill brings a whole lot
of mass to the masses.

13:40.987 --> 13:42.556
He brings so much more
than that.

13:42.589 --> 13:44.124
I can handle it.

13:44.157 --> 13:47.260
Not sure I can... or will.

14:04.844 --> 14:07.080
-Looking good, Bobby.
-Hey.

14:07.113 --> 14:09.282
Yeah, itching
to start physical therapy.

14:09.316 --> 14:10.884
Yeah,
you'll come back stronger.

14:10.917 --> 14:14.054
Yeah, thanks.
Trying to see it as a gift.

14:14.087 --> 14:16.122
There's a lot of time
to think now.

14:16.156 --> 14:17.591
You know what I've been
thinking about lately?

14:17.624 --> 14:19.259
When will Jesus come back?

14:19.292 --> 14:21.394
Nah, I ain't never
thinking about that.

14:21.428 --> 14:22.529
Your name's Apocalypse.

14:22.562 --> 14:24.130
Nicknamed after the movie.

14:24.164 --> 14:25.465
-Uh-huh.
-My dad was in Vietnam.

14:25.498 --> 14:28.101
Oh, making a movie?
That's dope.

14:28.134 --> 14:30.103
No, he-he was in Vietnam.

14:30.136 --> 14:31.171
Doing what?

14:31.204 --> 14:32.872
The fuck you mean,
"Doing what?"

14:32.906 --> 14:35.041
I'm asking a question.
You said after the movie.

14:35.075 --> 14:36.343
I was named after the movie.

14:36.376 --> 14:37.377
What movie?

14:37.410 --> 14:39.012
Apocalypse Now.

14:39.045 --> 14:41.548
-What's it about?
-The Vietnam fuckin' War!

14:42.882 --> 14:44.918
Oh, sorry,
I'm some kind of douchebag

14:44.951 --> 14:47.220
that doesn't know
about every fucking war.

14:47.254 --> 14:48.922
You graduated high school.

14:48.955 --> 14:50.056
Not with flying colors.

14:51.992 --> 14:54.227
It was a bad war. We lost.

14:54.261 --> 14:56.296
Respect. That's the shit, man.

14:56.329 --> 14:58.598
Not really. He was just a cook.

14:58.632 --> 15:01.568
A fat-ass fuckin' fat asshole
of a cook.

15:01.601 --> 15:05.005
He served, so to speak,
but he didn't serve, serve.

15:05.038 --> 15:06.973
Plus, he was a real prick
my whole life.

15:07.007 --> 15:08.141
Mm.

15:08.174 --> 15:09.476
But I guess when you
father a kid at 58,

15:09.509 --> 15:10.910
you're probably tired.

15:10.944 --> 15:12.412
Look, man, the Apocalypse,

15:12.445 --> 15:14.648
that thing that you are
not named after,

15:14.681 --> 15:16.483
that's what happens
when the world ends.

15:16.516 --> 15:17.984
That's why I brought up Jesus.

15:18.018 --> 15:20.253
I thought that
that was the Rapture.

15:20.287 --> 15:22.055
No, no, no.
That's for believers.

15:22.088 --> 15:23.623
Believers go
straight to heaven.

15:23.657 --> 15:26.126
Then Jesus comes back
and judges the rest, you know.

15:26.159 --> 15:28.194
This has got nothing to do with
what I'm trying to talk about.

15:28.228 --> 15:30.063
I gotta watch
more documentaries.

15:30.096 --> 15:31.931
Gotta learn more shit.

15:31.965 --> 15:34.301
I got this new robe
from Jack and Ace's mom.

15:34.334 --> 15:36.369
Flashy and shiny, huh?

15:36.403 --> 15:38.638
-Yeah.
-Whoo. Talented lady.

15:38.672 --> 15:40.674
Yeah, but this inside material,

15:40.707 --> 15:43.476
this sateen-like shit,
hurts my fuckin' nipples.

15:43.510 --> 15:44.978
Oh. Get Blistex.

15:45.011 --> 15:47.013
It's, like,
the enemy of chafing.

15:47.047 --> 15:49.082
No, Blistex is gonna
leave a stain.

15:49.115 --> 15:50.183
I was thinking.

15:50.216 --> 15:52.085
I got no idea
why men got nipples.

15:52.118 --> 15:54.721
-Ooh. I never thought about it.
-You should.

15:54.954 --> 15:57.624
It's on your body, and you got
no idea what it do.

15:57.657 --> 15:59.259
This is a legit inquiry.

15:59.292 --> 16:00.593
That's what I'm saying.
Milk ain't in 'em.

16:00.627 --> 16:02.696
Ain't coming out of 'em.
Why are they there?

16:02.729 --> 16:06.232
Well, maybe
it's an evolution thing.

16:06.266 --> 16:09.035
Like how you got grown-up teeth
above your baby teeth, right?

16:09.069 --> 16:10.570
Awaiting the call.

16:10.603 --> 16:12.372
Yeah, you know, my mom
still has all of my baby teeth

16:12.405 --> 16:14.674
in a little purse
on the nightstand.

16:14.708 --> 16:16.276
-Yeah, moms are the best.
-Yeah.

16:16.309 --> 16:17.577
Oh, that's it.

16:17.610 --> 16:19.212
Maybe God knew that one day,

16:19.245 --> 16:21.748
women would be, like,
running the workplace, right?

16:21.981 --> 16:24.317
And there'd be more
stay-at-home dads.

16:24.351 --> 16:26.186
So men got nipples
not just in case of,

16:26.219 --> 16:28.154
like, a total gender revolution

16:28.188 --> 16:30.757
but also in case
of emergency, man.

16:30.990 --> 16:33.593
Like a famine, right?
Or a plague?

16:33.626 --> 16:35.495
Or what if all the women
are out fighting

16:35.528 --> 16:37.097
in some new Vietnam,

16:37.130 --> 16:39.099
getting their bodies
blown to bits so democracy

16:39.132 --> 16:41.701
could survive like men
used to do, only now

16:41.735 --> 16:44.337
all the future men
need to be home, right?

16:44.371 --> 16:47.574
Bursting with nourishment
from their nipples, dude!

16:47.607 --> 16:49.342
-That would be so cool.
-Yeah.

16:49.376 --> 16:51.311
To have little kids
sucking on your nipples.

16:52.779 --> 16:54.314
Yeah. Yeah, right?

16:54.347 --> 16:56.049
Hey, y'all have got to be

16:56.082 --> 16:59.452
the most brain-damaged
individuals I have ever met.

16:59.486 --> 17:02.222
And I've met
some demented motherfuckers.

17:02.255 --> 17:03.623
I mean, I've dated
demented people,

17:03.656 --> 17:05.258
I've helped demented people,

17:05.291 --> 17:06.526
and I've fought
demented people,

17:06.559 --> 17:08.294
and if those
demented people were here,

17:08.328 --> 17:11.131
they would rejoice in knowing
that there exist

17:11.164 --> 17:12.599
far more demented people
than they are.

17:15.702 --> 17:17.137
Break!

17:17.170 --> 17:19.239
Don't go easy
on the birthday boy!

17:19.272 --> 17:21.174
Hey, would you let 'em
play without coaching?

17:21.207 --> 17:23.410
You're either coaching,
or you're letting it happen.

17:23.443 --> 17:25.145
Hut, hut, hike!

17:25.178 --> 17:26.579
I'm ready, I'm ready,
I'm ready.

17:30.283 --> 17:32.452
Whoo-hoo! That's my boy!

17:32.485 --> 17:34.754
Way to chuck it, Ace!
See what you did there, son?

17:34.788 --> 17:36.289
You threw it
to where he's running.

17:36.322 --> 17:37.757
That's the thinking, kiddo!

17:37.791 --> 17:39.292
Yeah, Ace has got a cannon,
eh, Dad?

17:39.325 --> 17:40.360
Oh-ho!

17:40.393 --> 17:42.429
Dan Marino times two,
Jackie boy!

17:42.462 --> 17:43.696
Ha-ha!

17:43.730 --> 17:44.697
Hut, hike!

17:46.332 --> 17:48.468
Oh.

17:48.501 --> 17:50.770
Yes!

17:52.405 --> 17:54.107
Whoo-hoo!

17:54.140 --> 17:56.075
Instincts, Jack.
You can't teach that.

17:56.109 --> 17:58.845
Hey, his footwork's
even better than yours was.

17:59.078 --> 18:01.714
Yeah, strong, athletic,
handsome.

18:01.748 --> 18:04.083
-Goddamn.
-Cocky as hell.

18:04.117 --> 18:06.453
Confident, Jack.
Poised and confident!

18:06.486 --> 18:08.188
That kid's got flair.

18:08.221 --> 18:09.756
Look at the proud papa.

18:12.659 --> 18:13.793
Let's see it again, guys!

18:13.827 --> 18:14.861
Twenty-four! Thirty-seven!

18:15.094 --> 18:17.430
-Come on!

18:17.464 --> 18:18.765
No, I won't be late.

18:18.798 --> 18:21.167
Yes, tell Melanie
I'll wear a fucking tie.

18:21.201 --> 18:22.602
What's up, godfather?

18:22.635 --> 18:24.270
Nothing, just sitting here

18:24.304 --> 18:26.206
thinking about what a bad
judge of character you are,

18:26.239 --> 18:27.407
having me be the backstop

18:27.440 --> 18:28.741
to your child's
religious upbringing.

18:28.775 --> 18:31.177
Uh, on that note, uh,

18:31.211 --> 18:33.680
I need you to say a few words
during the ceremony.

18:33.713 --> 18:35.315
The fuck kind of words?

18:35.348 --> 18:37.684
Uh, something about baptisms
and babies and shit.

18:37.717 --> 18:39.719
I-I'm not sure.
Just church words.

18:39.752 --> 18:41.754
Hey, you said my role
was ceremonial.

18:41.788 --> 18:44.557
Yes,
and the ceremony is today.

18:44.591 --> 18:46.459
Mel told me to tell you,
like, a week ago,

18:46.493 --> 18:48.328
but-but I must have taken
too many chairs to the head

18:48.361 --> 18:49.796
and-and forgot.

18:49.829 --> 18:51.331
But, uh, you just gotta
kick it off

18:51.364 --> 18:53.233
and introduce the congregation
to the baby.

18:53.266 --> 18:55.235
Bro, I barely know the baby!

18:55.268 --> 18:57.237
There's nothing to know.
But-but you do know church.

18:57.270 --> 18:58.638
You-you've been going
your whole life.

18:58.671 --> 19:00.473
But I haven't paid attention
very much!

19:00.507 --> 19:02.208
Look,
it's just a few words

19:02.242 --> 19:03.343
off the cuff, all right?

19:03.376 --> 19:05.144
You're a wrestler.
Just-just riff.

19:05.178 --> 19:06.279
Talking shit in the ring

19:06.312 --> 19:07.747
is very different
than riffing in church.

19:07.780 --> 19:09.649
No. Good versus evil.

19:09.682 --> 19:12.352
Crowds in the stands,
dudes in funny costumes.

19:12.385 --> 19:14.687
Just don't power-bomb
the pastor.

19:14.721 --> 19:16.422
Ugh, after what happened
with Bobby,

19:16.456 --> 19:18.224
I don't know if I should be
giving any speeches.

19:21.160 --> 19:23.329
Number one, don't expect it
to be great.

19:23.363 --> 19:24.898
Number two, go fuck yourself.

19:24.931 --> 19:26.900
Will do.

19:26.933 --> 19:28.701
You got this, god-daddy.

19:28.735 --> 19:29.736
Yeah, yeah.

19:42.582 --> 19:44.183
Hey, Mama, you all right?

19:44.217 --> 19:45.285
Yeah.

19:45.318 --> 19:47.353
Take these bags
to the car, please?

19:48.721 --> 19:50.456
This is Dad's stuff.

19:50.490 --> 19:52.625
It's taking up
too much space.

19:52.659 --> 19:55.194
You can't just
throw out Dad's stuff.

19:55.228 --> 19:56.629
I'm not throwing it out.

19:56.663 --> 19:58.331
I'm donating it.

19:58.364 --> 19:59.933
What if I want some of it?

19:59.966 --> 20:01.601
He left it to me.

20:21.955 --> 20:23.957
Hey, what's going on?

20:23.990 --> 20:26.259
Just waiting to head
over to the christening, you?

20:26.292 --> 20:27.694
Yeah, I gotta do
a little interview thing first.

20:27.727 --> 20:30.630
Why are there so many cars
in the parking lot?

20:30.663 --> 20:32.332
Rented to a jewelry show.

20:34.267 --> 20:36.903
Hey, Jack, I wanted to rap
with you about, um,

20:36.936 --> 20:38.638
where I'm slotted at
in the fair.

20:38.671 --> 20:40.640
Sure thing.
Can it wait till the barbecue?

20:40.673 --> 20:43.309
Sure. Sure can.

20:43.343 --> 20:45.511
Hey, and, uh-uh, just to--

20:45.545 --> 20:47.280
No, no, I get it. I get it.
Places to be, baby.

20:47.313 --> 20:48.348
If you're gonna smoke,
can you do it

20:48.381 --> 20:49.515
in the back, please?

20:49.549 --> 20:50.617
You're one of our faces.

20:50.650 --> 20:52.852
We got fans in there
buying jewelry.

20:56.623 --> 20:58.291
I was thinking
about quitting anyway.

21:00.393 --> 21:02.028
-Hey, Jack.
-Yeah?

21:02.261 --> 21:03.563
Bill's in the office.

21:03.596 --> 21:05.264
Course he is.

21:16.342 --> 21:18.511
Feet off my desk, Bill.

21:18.544 --> 21:19.746
You gonna threaten
to beat me up again?

21:19.779 --> 21:21.280
No, I'm gonna
make good on the threat

21:21.314 --> 21:22.649
from the first time,
but I got some business

21:22.682 --> 21:24.050
to attend to,
so you just sit tight.

21:24.283 --> 21:26.519
I saw Dickie Valentino.

21:26.552 --> 21:27.720
Fuck you say to him?

21:27.754 --> 21:29.822
I said,
"Welcome to the DWL, Dick.

21:29.856 --> 21:31.758
"Bet when you were born,
your parents never imagined

21:31.791 --> 21:33.993
your name would be synonymous
with cock."

21:35.328 --> 21:37.664
He laughed.
We're old acquaintances.

21:37.697 --> 21:41.034
Jack, the state fair's
only a month away.

21:41.067 --> 21:42.769
Fans are blowing up my socials.

21:42.802 --> 21:44.637
Barstool wants to promote
my comeback.

21:44.671 --> 21:46.406
Came to tell you I'm all in.

21:46.439 --> 21:49.409
You and me, we can grow the DWL
into something compelling,

21:49.442 --> 21:51.010
something beautiful,
a new story.

21:51.044 --> 21:52.478
We don't need
your help right now.

21:52.512 --> 21:54.614
When you were on top,
my daddy needed your help,

21:54.647 --> 21:56.916
and you offered
fuckin' nothin'!

21:56.949 --> 21:58.818
That's the compelling story.

22:00.086 --> 22:02.355
Zero fuckin' gratitude.

22:02.388 --> 22:04.891
Our friendship had more nuance
than you've been told.

22:04.924 --> 22:06.993
You dad never asked for help.

22:07.026 --> 22:09.495
Couldn't stomach that
I got picked and he didn't.

22:09.529 --> 22:12.365
And I did come back to help
before I got fired.

22:12.398 --> 22:14.901
Came back to give Ace
a chance at the big time.

22:14.934 --> 22:17.070
You view it differently,
but come on, man.

22:17.103 --> 22:18.771
There's a hundred Ace Spades
from Oklahoma

22:18.805 --> 22:20.406
to the Florida Panhandle alone.

22:20.440 --> 22:22.375
I had a goddamn golden ticket
to give to your brother.

22:22.408 --> 22:24.077
We know how that went.

22:24.110 --> 22:26.713
But fuck it.
Let's rise up together.

22:26.746 --> 22:29.982
Make this thing great!
Great in a way it never was!

22:30.016 --> 22:31.784
After the fuckin' screw job
you pulled last weekend,

22:31.818 --> 22:33.586
how am I supposed to trust you?

22:33.619 --> 22:35.054
'Cause that was inspired.

22:35.088 --> 22:38.124
And without me,
there's nothing to talk about.

22:38.357 --> 22:40.560
I got the state fair
following me on Instagram,

22:40.593 --> 22:42.028
but there's a year's worth
of promotion and prep

22:42.061 --> 22:43.429
if we're gonna
put this thing over.

22:43.463 --> 22:44.731
I'm promoting it just fine.

22:44.764 --> 22:46.699
With Dickie Valentino's
podcast?

22:46.733 --> 22:48.101
I wrestled that douchebag
back in Atlanta.

22:48.134 --> 22:50.470
Fucker broke my wrist
in an "I quit" match.

22:50.503 --> 22:51.604
Guy's a snake.

22:51.637 --> 22:53.473
Reckon you know one, being one.

22:53.506 --> 22:55.942
Watch your back is all.

22:55.975 --> 22:57.977
There's gonna be no talking
about the state fair

22:58.010 --> 22:59.612
till you talk to Willie.

23:01.581 --> 23:03.516
Fuck's she still wound up
about?

23:08.821 --> 23:10.923
-Hey, Dick.
-Hey, Jack!

23:10.957 --> 23:12.425
Sorry that I'm late.

23:12.458 --> 23:13.626
I forgot we had this
little old lady show going on.

23:13.659 --> 23:14.827
That's all right.

23:14.861 --> 23:16.062
There's a lot
of fine craftsmanship here.

23:16.095 --> 23:18.464
The lady in the corner
has got a sweet booth.

23:18.498 --> 23:21.567
Check this out.
Sapphire and silver.

23:21.601 --> 23:24.403
Can we record in my office?

23:24.437 --> 23:27.540
Hey, Willie. You got a sec?

23:27.573 --> 23:28.941
Hey, Ted.

23:28.975 --> 23:30.109
Afternoon, Crystal.

23:30.143 --> 23:31.978
Beautiful day
for a beautiful ceremony.

23:32.011 --> 23:33.913
Why don't you go in
and grab us a good seat, right?

23:33.946 --> 23:35.982
One in the back so we can
slip out when it goes too long.

23:36.015 --> 23:37.784
-All right.
-What is it?

23:37.817 --> 23:40.553
Uh, listen, I-I really
don't wanna bother Jack.

23:40.586 --> 23:42.155
Bother him. That's his job.

23:43.189 --> 23:44.924
I was just curious, uh,
if he told you

23:44.957 --> 23:47.894
what my role
at the fair was gonna be.

23:47.927 --> 23:49.595
Told you last week to ask him.

23:49.629 --> 23:52.765
I know I'm-I'm probably not
Ace's valet anymore,

23:52.799 --> 23:56.803
and Bobby's gonna be out
for God knows how long,

23:56.836 --> 24:01.073
so I just feel like I don't
really have a place right now.

24:01.107 --> 24:02.775
Sounds like you already
got your answer.

24:02.809 --> 24:03.810
Whose fault is that?

24:03.843 --> 24:05.044
Fault-fault about what?

24:05.077 --> 24:06.212
If you're gone,
it's your fault,

24:06.445 --> 24:07.713
Miss Ad-libber. You did this.

24:07.747 --> 24:09.615
I didn't mean
for Bobby to get hurt.

24:09.649 --> 24:11.017
I don't wanna be
Dragon Lady here

24:11.050 --> 24:12.618
'cause I know we women,
we gotta stick together

24:12.652 --> 24:14.520
in a rotten old world
run by idiotic men,

24:14.554 --> 24:16.789
but you decided you didn't like
what was written,

24:16.823 --> 24:19.559
so you decided to change it.
You lit the match.

24:19.592 --> 24:21.527
Don't be pretending
you don't know how fire works,

24:21.561 --> 24:23.496
'cause you do, darling.

24:23.529 --> 24:24.564
And by now,
you should also know

24:24.597 --> 24:26.632
we all just answer
to Jack Spade.

24:34.507 --> 24:35.975
Oh, man,
my foot is cold.

24:36.008 --> 24:38.077
You should've wore a sock.

24:38.110 --> 24:40.079
Let's talk
about this main event.

24:40.112 --> 24:43.916
Appears to my eyes like
Wild Bill is back in the mix.

24:43.950 --> 24:45.952
That has yet to be decided.

24:45.985 --> 24:47.920
I think his actions
in the ring decided it, Jack.

24:47.954 --> 24:49.522
Folks around here,
they're invested.

24:49.555 --> 24:51.157
He laid down
some pretty wild attacks,

24:51.190 --> 24:54.193
and Jack Spade doesn't let
fighting words go unanswered.

24:54.227 --> 24:55.595
Yeah, he used
some of those fighting words

24:55.628 --> 24:57.630
against your brother,
Ace Spade, as well.

24:57.663 --> 24:59.265
So Ace, he's got to be
in the main event.

24:59.498 --> 25:01.133
It's all still percolating.

25:01.167 --> 25:02.535
Percolating?

25:02.568 --> 25:04.537
What the hell
are we promoting here, Jack?

25:04.570 --> 25:07.139
Seems to me like there's a beef
brewing between you brothers.

25:07.173 --> 25:09.141
I'm sure you remember
from your wrestling days, Dick,

25:09.175 --> 25:12.712
that when you've had the belt
as long as I have or you did,

25:12.745 --> 25:14.814
people gonna attack you
from all angles.

25:14.847 --> 25:16.282
Even your own kin.

25:16.515 --> 25:19.685
Which is what's gonna make this
state fair so darn explosive.

25:19.719 --> 25:20.887
Depending on who's in it.

25:20.920 --> 25:23.122
The problem is,
I can't tell my listeners,

25:23.155 --> 25:25.725
Dick Valentino's listeners,
who's in the main event.

25:25.758 --> 25:28.127
It seems to me neither can you.

25:28.160 --> 25:30.029
I got the belt.
You can tell 'em I'm in it.

25:31.764 --> 25:34.834
This past fall, Jack,
your promotion gained a level

25:34.867 --> 25:39.005
of Internet infamy when you
defeated your brother, Ace,

25:39.038 --> 25:42.575
in 15 seconds with a hold
that appeared to these eyes

25:42.608 --> 25:43.709
to be really painful.

25:43.743 --> 25:45.845
And then Ace burst into tears.

25:45.878 --> 25:47.947
Now, your daddy, King Spade,

25:47.980 --> 25:50.082
was known around these parts
as a great wrestler,

25:50.116 --> 25:53.552
but he also had a tenuous
grasp on his composure,

25:53.586 --> 25:54.854
and that brought with it
a great sense

25:54.887 --> 25:56.756
of real danger to the ring.

25:56.789 --> 25:58.791
Come clean with me, Jack.

25:58.824 --> 26:00.293
You got some
of your old man's anger?

26:03.195 --> 26:06.098
I thought we were here to talk
about the future of the DWL.

26:06.132 --> 26:08.668
We got an hour, Jack.
We'll get there.

26:08.701 --> 26:10.870
Now, this is just me,
just thinking out loud.

26:10.903 --> 26:13.572
Remembering your father,
well, he was--

26:13.606 --> 26:14.941
I'm just gonna say it.

26:14.974 --> 26:17.643
Your father, Tom, he was one
tough somebitch Jack.

26:17.677 --> 26:19.712
Always had to have
things his way.

26:19.745 --> 26:22.148
So when I get the news that
your father kills himself...

26:22.181 --> 26:24.183
I'm not fuckin'
talking about that.

26:29.789 --> 26:31.123
My apologies for cussing.

26:31.157 --> 26:33.292
It's okay, Jack.
It's a podcast.

26:33.326 --> 26:35.094
You ever listen to my podcast?

26:35.127 --> 26:36.195
I never miss it.

26:36.228 --> 26:38.030
It's called
"No Questions Barred"

26:38.064 --> 26:39.598
for a reason--

26:39.632 --> 26:42.868
because I use my platform
to get people to care.

26:42.902 --> 26:45.871
They support me
because I tell them the truth

26:45.905 --> 26:48.641
about this business we all love

26:48.674 --> 26:50.743
but also about its cost.

26:50.776 --> 26:54.647
Your father's death
and how it made you feel,

26:54.680 --> 26:57.149
that's interesting
to my listeners.

26:58.884 --> 27:00.720
It's not interesting to me.

27:49.869 --> 27:52.972
I can smell
what you had for breakfast.

27:53.005 --> 27:55.241
You never told me
she could sing like that.

27:55.274 --> 27:59.045
I did tell you.
A million times, I did.

28:08.254 --> 28:09.422
Oh, shit.

28:11.824 --> 28:13.392
God damn it.

28:39.452 --> 28:41.754
Today we welcome baby Shelby

28:41.787 --> 28:45.257
into a life infused
with God's love.

28:45.291 --> 28:47.359
God wants you
to feel his love,

28:47.393 --> 28:49.795
and he wants you to flourish.

28:50.863 --> 28:54.433
Let's all pause for a moment
and reflect on a time

28:54.467 --> 28:59.472
when God's love
has helped you to flourish.

29:13.819 --> 29:16.922
And now the godparents
would like to say a few words.

29:16.956 --> 29:18.491
Ace, we'll start with you.

29:27.833 --> 29:30.803
Uh, Jim asked me to, uh,

29:30.836 --> 29:34.340
say a few words
a while ago or so.

29:34.373 --> 29:38.978
Uh, Jim and I have known
each other since grade school,

29:39.011 --> 29:41.313
more specifically
grade school detention.

29:42.948 --> 29:47.486
Uh, we've been inseparable
ever since we were kids, and...

29:47.520 --> 29:51.023
now Mel and Jim
are baptizing their own kid.

29:52.925 --> 29:56.028
Baptism is a lifelong journey.

29:56.061 --> 29:58.497
Um, a winding road of, uh,

29:58.531 --> 30:02.201
mistake making
and learning and growing.

30:05.004 --> 30:07.840
You know, if you're a lot like
this congregation and...

30:07.873 --> 30:11.343
especially me, uh,
you're gonna stumble,

30:11.377 --> 30:13.979
you're gonna get scuffed up,

30:14.013 --> 30:16.849
and you're gonna wrestle
with some demons.

30:16.882 --> 30:20.386
Some real, some imagined,

30:20.419 --> 30:25.024
some put upon you,
and some you put upon yourself.

30:30.095 --> 30:34.600
Shelby... this is the start
of your story,

30:34.833 --> 30:36.168
a story that says
you gotta inherit

30:36.202 --> 30:39.972
a lot of original bad stuff.

30:40.005 --> 30:41.941
But we wash that off today.

30:43.976 --> 30:45.277
Know that if you
make a mistake,

30:45.311 --> 30:47.580
it don't mean you can't
keep turning the page,

30:47.613 --> 30:49.381
revising your story,

30:49.415 --> 30:51.917
saying your sorries,
and starting anew.

30:54.386 --> 30:56.889
I mean, that's what
life's about, right?

30:56.922 --> 30:58.891
Writing a story
we could all be proud of.

31:01.360 --> 31:04.063
Even if it's got some bad
or boring chapters in it.

31:05.097 --> 31:08.167
Like it or not, you're a part
of the Duffy story now.

31:08.200 --> 31:10.169
The Duffy family.

31:11.604 --> 31:14.073
I can't wait
to watch you grow up.

31:15.274 --> 31:18.944
Folks, uh, I present to you,
Shelby Warren Kitchen.

31:26.151 --> 31:27.586
Aw, welcome, sweetheart.

31:27.620 --> 31:29.588
Welcome to the world.

31:33.959 --> 31:35.027
All right, Thomas.
Nice and easy.

31:35.060 --> 31:36.128
-All right, easy.
-Just a nice, easy toss.

31:36.161 --> 31:38.264
Let's go, Thomas!

31:38.297 --> 31:40.099
-Oh!
-Oh, nice shot.

31:40.132 --> 31:42.101
That was a great share
the other day.

31:42.134 --> 31:43.202
Thank you, Annie.

31:43.235 --> 31:44.370
It's so great
to have you with us.

31:44.403 --> 31:45.504
Thank you.

31:45.537 --> 31:48.040
I was worried
you wouldn't show.

31:48.073 --> 31:49.141
I mean, what's a baptism

31:49.174 --> 31:51.110
without a super awkward
godfather?

31:51.143 --> 31:53.679
Hey, you did good, all right?

31:55.948 --> 31:58.284
Did bad to that poor fucker.

31:58.317 --> 32:02.121
I saw. Fuck happened?

32:02.154 --> 32:03.389
He got his leg broke.

32:03.422 --> 32:05.124
I know that.

32:05.157 --> 32:06.625
Hey, he-he's a good dude.

32:06.659 --> 32:09.962
You, uh, apologize to him?

32:11.263 --> 32:13.432
Come on, Ace. It's me.

32:13.465 --> 32:16.435
That dude got fucked up bad,
and-and you can't tell me

32:16.468 --> 32:18.570
that's what Jack wrote
to happen.

32:18.604 --> 32:21.073
Ma'am, here you go.

32:21.106 --> 32:22.608
You're welcome.

32:27.613 --> 32:30.416
Mm. You look sad.

32:32.418 --> 32:35.354
Willie said your broken leg
is my fault.

32:35.387 --> 32:36.588
-What?
-She's right.

32:36.622 --> 32:38.357
No, it was no one's fault
but mine.

32:38.390 --> 32:42.695
I went off-script.
I provoked a volatile person.

32:42.728 --> 32:45.264
I-I'm sorry, Bobby.

32:45.297 --> 32:47.466
I-I'm really sorry
that I did that.

32:47.499 --> 32:49.335
Look, if you wanna get
in the ring with the big boys,

32:49.368 --> 32:51.637
you're gonna run the risk
of things not going your way.

32:51.670 --> 32:53.272
No, I shouldn't have
lit the match.

32:53.305 --> 32:55.374
Well, you shouldn't even
be a valet anymore.

32:55.407 --> 32:56.508
I mean, you gotta bulk up
a little bit,

32:56.542 --> 32:58.310
but it's nothing
a couple protein shakes

32:58.344 --> 33:01.046
and a lot of grilled chicken
can't fix.

33:01.080 --> 33:02.614
Deep down, you're a wrestler.

33:02.648 --> 33:04.350
Jack and Willie don't think so.

33:04.383 --> 33:06.752
Yeah, well, you know,
my mom always says,

33:06.985 --> 33:08.220
"You're under no obligation

33:08.253 --> 33:10.622
to accept someone else's
assessment of you."

33:13.025 --> 33:14.626
I wish your mom was my mom.

33:16.228 --> 33:18.130
No, 'cause then
we'd be related.

33:19.565 --> 33:20.766
You want another beer?

33:20.999 --> 33:22.501
No, I got it. I got it.

33:23.435 --> 33:25.404
-Thank you.
-I'll be right back.

33:25.437 --> 33:28.474
They say the facial recognition
software is better,

33:28.507 --> 33:30.075
but I-I don't see
any reason to upgrade--

33:30.109 --> 33:32.044
-Hey there. Hey, Pastor.
-Hey, Jack.

33:32.077 --> 33:34.213
-That was a lovely sermon.
-Oh, thank you.

33:34.246 --> 33:35.414
What part did you enjoy most?

33:35.447 --> 33:38.050
Well, had to be Staci's song.

33:38.083 --> 33:40.185
I heard that it was great.

33:40.219 --> 33:43.622
Uh, sadly, um, I-I had
some business to attend to.

33:43.655 --> 33:45.491
The DWL never sleeps.

33:45.524 --> 33:47.659
I hear
congratulations are in order.

33:47.693 --> 33:50.095
The state fair, huh?
That's big stuff.

33:50.129 --> 33:51.563
You know, I've been going
since I was a kid.

33:51.597 --> 33:53.432
I saw all the big acts there.

33:53.465 --> 33:55.234
Well, tell me,
what does it take to pull off

33:55.267 --> 33:57.336
an event like that
on such a massive scale?

33:57.369 --> 33:58.537
Blood, sweat,

33:58.570 --> 33:59.605
and enlisting the help
of terrible people

33:59.638 --> 34:01.373
who may undermine
your hard work.

34:01.407 --> 34:02.741
Well, that just sounds
like running a church.

34:02.775 --> 34:04.676
I'm already thinking
way past the state fair,

34:04.710 --> 34:07.179
which, of course, is a great
opportunity for brand exposure.

34:07.212 --> 34:09.148
But we got the talent,
but you gotta--you gotta

34:09.181 --> 34:10.649
print new merchandise,
and, you know,

34:10.682 --> 34:12.451
sometimes you gotta
spend money to make money.

34:12.484 --> 34:13.652
Hmm.

34:13.685 --> 34:16.155
Well, church folks like me,
we just beg.

34:16.188 --> 34:18.457
There it is.
We're not too dissimilar.

34:18.490 --> 34:19.825
Excuse me. I need a refill.

34:22.161 --> 34:25.364
Staci, that was just so great.

34:25.397 --> 34:27.533
Oh, thank you, Annie,
for always saying that.

34:27.566 --> 34:29.701
-You got the voice of an angel.
-Thank you, Eddie.

34:29.735 --> 34:31.203
And he would know that
if he ever came

34:31.236 --> 34:32.404
to church with me.

34:32.438 --> 34:34.339
People buy cars
on Sunday, dear.

34:34.373 --> 34:36.475
Not all day.

34:41.079 --> 34:43.182
Oh, dadgummit.

34:43.215 --> 34:44.550
Hey, Bobby, uh,
I got this, man.

34:44.583 --> 34:46.151
-Oh, man. Thank you.
-What do you want?

34:46.185 --> 34:47.753
-That'd be great.
-Just leave that stuff.

34:47.786 --> 34:49.688
I appreciate it.
Uh, just, uh, some chicken

34:49.721 --> 34:52.758
and ribs would be great.

34:52.791 --> 34:55.227
-And then some corn.
-Okay. Okay.

34:55.260 --> 34:58.096
That's perfect. Thank you, man.

34:58.130 --> 34:59.465
-That it, or...
-And, uh,

34:59.498 --> 35:01.467
just some ranch sauce,
if you don't mind.

35:01.500 --> 35:02.568
On the corn or...

35:02.601 --> 35:04.536
Oh, just, like, uh, everything.

35:04.570 --> 35:07.272
-Even the barbecue?
-Oh, yeah.

35:07.306 --> 35:09.208
-Okay, tell me when.
-Mm-hmm.

35:17.516 --> 35:20.118
When. Perfect.

35:20.152 --> 35:21.820
-Okay.
-Thanks, man.

35:21.854 --> 35:23.489
Uh, I--you know,
I'll take this to the table.

35:23.522 --> 35:25.524
Oh, thank you, man.
Appreciate it.

35:27.292 --> 35:29.595
Hey, Bobby, uh...

35:31.163 --> 35:34.800
...I-I-I--I'm sorry.

35:34.833 --> 35:37.736
Just I'm sorry. No excuses.
I'm sorry.

35:37.769 --> 35:39.905
No worries.

35:40.138 --> 35:41.673
Look, man,
if I could go back and--

35:41.707 --> 35:43.642
Yeah, no need.

35:43.675 --> 35:45.444
You know, it's a new day.

35:46.845 --> 35:48.247
It's all good.

35:49.882 --> 35:51.450
But thank you.

35:52.451 --> 35:53.552
Hey.

35:53.585 --> 35:55.287
Hey, Crystal.

35:55.320 --> 35:56.822
Ace.

35:56.855 --> 35:58.824
Uh, nice words today
for the baby.

35:58.857 --> 36:00.325
Thanks. Yeah.

36:00.359 --> 36:02.794
She's a, uh--
she's a great baby.

36:02.828 --> 36:04.263
Really is.

36:07.699 --> 36:09.701
That's a lot of ranch.

36:09.735 --> 36:12.671
Uh, it's-it's Bobby's.

36:12.704 --> 36:15.641
I like ranch.

36:15.674 --> 36:16.675
I can take it.

36:20.345 --> 36:22.180
-Thanks, man.
-Yeah, man.

36:32.591 --> 36:34.459
-Uh, hey, Jack.
-Hey, Rooster.

36:34.493 --> 36:36.929
How'd the podcast go?

36:36.962 --> 36:39.197
-Shitty.

36:39.231 --> 36:40.465
Well, I was wondering
if you, uh,

36:40.499 --> 36:42.701
settled up on a lineup
for the fair.

36:42.734 --> 36:45.370
I would love to throw my name
in the hat for the main event.

36:45.404 --> 36:46.805
Now, you know I will deliver.

36:46.838 --> 36:49.308
-Didn't say you wouldn't.
-Haven't said I will.

36:49.341 --> 36:50.642
Rooster, it's seeming to me
we just keep--

36:50.676 --> 36:52.811
we keep having
the same conversation.

36:52.844 --> 36:55.447
Actually, Jack,
it seems the same,

36:55.480 --> 36:57.583
but each time,
it's a little different.

36:59.451 --> 37:00.919
You enjoy your night.

37:02.220 --> 37:05.691
What the fuck? Jesus Christ.

37:05.724 --> 37:07.993
Ted lines up for his
final toss of the game.

37:08.226 --> 37:09.661
Oh, wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!

37:09.695 --> 37:10.963
I wanna watch! I wanna watch!

37:10.996 --> 37:12.731
Come on, Mama. Come on.

37:12.764 --> 37:14.866
Okay, here we go.
Here we go.

37:14.900 --> 37:16.735
Lining up his shot.

37:19.304 --> 37:20.539
Yeah! That's my man!

37:20.572 --> 37:21.840
That is
a motherfuckin' shot, man!

37:21.873 --> 37:24.676
Yeah, while you were
no doubt playing real sports,

37:24.710 --> 37:26.411
I was drinking
and playing cornhole.

37:45.731 --> 37:47.899
Thank you guys for coming.
Take care!

37:49.935 --> 37:52.404
Oof, I think both of my arms
are asleep.

37:52.437 --> 37:53.438
Hey, let me take her.

37:53.472 --> 37:55.440
Please.
I would love you forever.

37:57.809 --> 37:59.011
Hi.

38:00.812 --> 38:02.581
So this is your life now.

38:02.614 --> 38:04.650
By design, my friend.

38:04.683 --> 38:07.386
It's by design.

38:07.419 --> 38:08.787
You ever find yourself
missing--

38:08.820 --> 38:11.556
Wrestling? No.

38:11.590 --> 38:13.558
Uh, I mean,
I miss you and the guys,

38:13.592 --> 38:16.294
but, uh, I reckon
I never felt more like myself.

38:22.868 --> 38:27.439
Hey, y'all mind if I...
just hold her for a second?

38:27.472 --> 38:30.609
You're her godfather,
for Christ's sake!

38:37.382 --> 38:38.817
You mind if I...

38:40.519 --> 38:42.554
Uh, yeah.

38:42.587 --> 38:44.923
-Just careful.
-Yep. Yeah.

38:44.956 --> 38:47.059
-Here.
-Oh, okay.

38:48.326 --> 38:50.495
Here.

38:50.529 --> 38:51.730
Is this how
I'm supposed to, uh--

38:51.763 --> 38:52.931
Watch her head and neck.

38:52.964 --> 38:55.867
We-we need her brain to work.
She's the future.

39:12.918 --> 39:16.621
She's so sleepy.
She's beautiful.

39:32.637 --> 39:33.739
Hey! Fireflies.

39:33.772 --> 39:35.373
Thomas,
for your science project.

39:35.407 --> 39:37.109
Maybe we can all go out there
together and get some.

39:37.142 --> 39:39.010
Nah, there'll be some tomorrow.

39:39.044 --> 39:40.479
If he doesn't want to...

39:40.512 --> 39:42.114
It's supposed to rain tomorrow.

39:44.082 --> 39:45.684
It's your project, buddy.
Grab a jar.

39:58.063 --> 39:59.598
-I almost got one!

39:59.631 --> 40:02.167
Look at you.
Good job, baby.

40:02.400 --> 40:04.603
-Wow! Good one, Mom.

40:06.404 --> 40:08.673
-Saw some.

40:08.707 --> 40:10.809
Oh!

40:10.842 --> 40:12.177
Come on, Mom! Hurry!

40:15.647 --> 40:17.482
I got it. I got it!

40:21.153 --> 40:22.554
Got one!

40:39.070 --> 40:41.840
Ugh.

40:43.008 --> 40:45.544
Catching a cold?

40:45.577 --> 40:47.145
You know, I would've thought
after you were up there

40:47.179 --> 40:49.014
preaching today,

40:49.047 --> 40:50.715
"bless you" might have been

40:50.749 --> 40:53.084
a knee-jerk reaction
to a sneeze.

40:53.118 --> 40:54.653
Bless you.

41:02.194 --> 41:04.796
I'm really sorry
for ad-libbing at the match.

41:06.531 --> 41:08.066
I shouldn't have done that.

41:15.974 --> 41:17.209
Crystal.

41:21.513 --> 41:23.148
I shouldn't have been
mean to you.

41:24.549 --> 41:26.184
I shouldn't have.

41:29.054 --> 41:33.558
You got a real good thing going
in the ring and in life.

41:35.594 --> 41:36.962
It's special.

41:38.496 --> 41:39.798
Like you.

41:43.235 --> 41:44.769
And I'm--

41:48.607 --> 41:49.608
Yeah.

42:25.277 --> 42:27.212
No, you can't stay later.

42:27.245 --> 42:29.781
Yes, I saw your text.

42:29.814 --> 42:30.849
You think using a tampon

42:30.882 --> 42:32.684
makes you a grown woman,
act like one.

42:32.717 --> 42:34.286
Being a grown woman means
getting used to being told

42:34.319 --> 42:35.954
to do something
you don't wanna do,

42:35.987 --> 42:37.589
dealing with the frustration
that comes

42:37.622 --> 42:39.691
when you realize you're not
in a position to change it,

42:39.724 --> 42:41.092
and then absorbing that
in the hopes that you can

42:41.126 --> 42:43.128
transform it into something
more useful later.

42:43.161 --> 42:44.729
I'm leaving the Dome now.

42:44.763 --> 42:45.931
I expect you to be home
when I get there.

42:45.964 --> 42:47.866
Tell Amber's mother
I said hello.

42:49.100 --> 42:50.235
Hey.

42:50.268 --> 42:52.804
Fuck, man! Fuck.

42:52.837 --> 42:54.773
Saw your car in the lot.

42:54.806 --> 42:57.075
I don't give a fuck.
You can't just--

42:57.108 --> 42:58.576
What the fuck, man?

42:59.878 --> 43:01.346
Texted you a few times.

43:01.579 --> 43:03.148
Don't care.

43:03.181 --> 43:04.749
Left you a couple messages.

43:04.783 --> 43:06.685
Didn't listen.

43:06.718 --> 43:08.219
Came by earlier,
but you were gone.

43:08.253 --> 43:10.322
You came by
to kiss up to Jack.

43:12.590 --> 43:14.059
Will you relay something
to Ted?

43:14.092 --> 43:15.794
He's got a phone. Call him.

43:17.729 --> 43:19.798
Look, it wasn't right,
what I said.

43:21.232 --> 43:22.600
Wow.

43:23.601 --> 43:25.036
Wow what?

43:25.070 --> 43:26.838
That's how you're gonna put it?

43:26.871 --> 43:29.708
Yeah. It was not right.

43:29.741 --> 43:31.743
Well, anyone can tell you
it was not right.

43:31.776 --> 43:34.980
It not being right is
an indisputable fuckin' fact.

43:35.013 --> 43:37.716
-Yeah.
-Yeah. And?

43:37.749 --> 43:38.917
And?

43:40.885 --> 43:42.821
I'm not sure what that look is.

43:43.955 --> 43:46.624
State your purpose
for being here.

43:46.658 --> 43:48.827
-I wanted to see you.
-For what purpose?

43:50.362 --> 43:51.363
Uh...

43:54.099 --> 43:56.134
Are you trying
to say you're sorry?

43:56.167 --> 43:57.902
-Yes.
-Then say it.

43:57.936 --> 43:59.704
I said what I said
was not right.

43:59.738 --> 44:01.006
That's a statement
about the past.

44:01.039 --> 44:02.374
If you wanna apologize
in the present, then do it.

44:02.407 --> 44:06.678
I mean, shit,
what I said was not right.

44:06.711 --> 44:08.279
It was a terrible thing to say.

44:09.214 --> 44:11.316
I've let my life
get a bit out of control.

44:11.349 --> 44:13.018
Don't shift to self-pity.
Your...

44:14.753 --> 44:17.756
...your behavior,
where you go to impulsively...

44:19.024 --> 44:22.794
...you need to reflect on that
with deep fuckin' concern.

44:22.827 --> 44:24.929
It's ugly. Scary.

44:24.963 --> 44:26.698
Oh, that's something,
coming from you.

44:26.731 --> 44:28.133
You never scared easily.

44:28.166 --> 44:30.869
That's 'cause you're a sniper
in your own right.

44:30.902 --> 44:32.337
But that's what I like
about you, Willie.

44:32.370 --> 44:33.738
Don't fuckin' touch me.

44:37.709 --> 44:39.010
A long time ago,
when you were here

44:39.044 --> 44:43.748
and we were more...
familiar with one another,

44:43.782 --> 44:46.117
you were more open
to being kind.

44:47.852 --> 44:48.953
Not anymore.

44:50.889 --> 44:52.257
Fuck off.

44:58.129 --> 45:00.932
Willie.

45:00.965 --> 45:02.300
Willie.

45:02.333 --> 45:04.903
I am sorry.

45:04.936 --> 45:06.438
I would like to say
I have no idea

45:06.471 --> 45:08.473
why I said those things,
but I have an idea.

45:08.706 --> 45:10.875
I seem to enjoy
unraveling people.

45:10.909 --> 45:13.912
Worked for me in business
but not really in life.

45:13.945 --> 45:17.182
I'm sorry for what I said
and how it hurt you.

45:18.783 --> 45:20.485
Piling up new words
on top of old words

45:20.718 --> 45:22.153
can't make
the old words unsaid.

45:22.187 --> 45:24.155
Right.

45:24.189 --> 45:26.825
It's just...

45:26.858 --> 45:29.227
...I've been simmering
on some shit for far too long,

45:29.260 --> 45:31.996
and I figure it's time
for some divulging.

45:32.030 --> 45:34.165
Not to deflect.

45:34.199 --> 45:35.800
To shade things in.

45:38.970 --> 45:41.439
I think I--

45:41.473 --> 45:45.510
no, I know I--

45:45.743 --> 45:47.112
Spit it the fuck out!

45:47.145 --> 45:51.015
I was kind back-back when I was
here a long time ago.

45:51.049 --> 45:54.085
I was kind then
because I loved you.

45:55.854 --> 45:59.357
And I thought you loved me.

45:59.390 --> 46:03.194
Then one day...
you just dropped me.

46:04.462 --> 46:07.765
Decided I was a dead end.

46:07.799 --> 46:09.267
And it crushed me.

46:11.035 --> 46:14.339
It-it fuckin' crushed me.

46:18.543 --> 46:20.812
Sorry that wasn't
spit out faster.

46:20.845 --> 46:22.547
It took, what,

46:22.780 --> 46:24.382
shit, a couple decades

46:24.415 --> 46:27.519
to consolidate
into a cogent thought.

46:30.788 --> 46:32.790
Tom was being scouted.
He asked.

46:32.824 --> 46:35.894
We were all here
building something together.

46:37.128 --> 46:39.097
Opportunity came
to you and Tom,

46:39.130 --> 46:42.000
and you both decided,
without me,

46:42.033 --> 46:45.537
that it was a better bet
you being Tom's valet

46:45.570 --> 46:47.539
when you're already mine.

46:49.207 --> 46:52.043
You thought I didn't have
what it took to go all the way.

46:52.076 --> 46:53.878
Clearly, I was wrong.

46:53.912 --> 46:57.882
But then you
kicked me out of your bed...

46:57.916 --> 46:59.250
and that hurt worse.

47:00.518 --> 47:04.422
And I was like, "Fuck it.

47:04.455 --> 47:06.191
"That's what you want.

47:06.224 --> 47:09.427
You're wrong, but fuck it."

47:10.862 --> 47:12.897
And I hung on to it.

47:14.132 --> 47:17.168
I hung on to it
real, real good.

47:21.339 --> 47:23.474
I'm sorry about all that.

47:24.509 --> 47:26.344
Thank you.

47:26.377 --> 47:28.546
But I guess piling up new words
on top of old words

47:28.580 --> 47:30.281
can't make
the old words unsaid,

47:30.315 --> 47:32.550
even if the word is "sorry."

47:32.584 --> 47:33.985
Or can it?

47:34.018 --> 47:35.954
Don't go getting fuckin' witty.

47:35.987 --> 47:38.556
If you think the two things
are the same, they aren't.

47:39.958 --> 47:42.393
I'm just trying to apologize.

47:42.427 --> 47:46.464
I hurt you long ago. I'm sorry.

47:46.497 --> 47:48.399
But I thought I--

47:48.433 --> 47:50.268
I thought the action,

47:50.301 --> 47:52.337
the fuckin' action
speaking louder than words

47:52.370 --> 47:53.972
of me letting you stay
in my home

47:54.005 --> 47:55.273
and keeping
your fuckin' shit there

47:55.306 --> 47:57.375
and trying to be
a fuckin' oasis to you

47:57.408 --> 48:01.646
in the midst of all your
other chaos was, I thought...

48:01.879 --> 48:04.048
an indication...

48:04.082 --> 48:07.452
that I, as a grown,
adult woman...

48:07.485 --> 48:09.454
wanted to be there for you

48:09.487 --> 48:11.289
in your life as a friend.

48:14.158 --> 48:17.662
Despite the stupid decision
I made to be Tom's valet...

48:19.364 --> 48:21.666
...when I knew it would lead
to us breaking up.

48:24.302 --> 48:28.539
I appreciate that. Have.
Well, I do.

48:30.441 --> 48:33.378
But my daughter
had nothing to do

48:33.411 --> 48:35.380
with what I did or said to you.

48:35.413 --> 48:37.315
That's why I'm apologizing.

48:55.466 --> 48:57.235
You may hang up or press one

48:57.268 --> 48:59.504
-for more options.

48:59.537 --> 49:02.106
Hey, Gully. It's Rooster.

49:02.140 --> 49:03.408
I'm in.

49:15.386 --> 49:17.221
Those things gonna survive?

49:17.255 --> 49:19.991
Don't know. It's an experiment.

49:20.024 --> 49:22.126
I'm sorry I missed your song.

49:22.160 --> 49:23.328
Me too.

49:25.296 --> 49:27.198
How'd all your stuff go?

49:27.231 --> 49:28.299
Uh, it-it went okay.

49:28.333 --> 49:29.600
Trying to navigate

49:29.634 --> 49:32.270
whether to bring Bill in
for the state fair.

49:32.303 --> 49:34.105
I got a shit ton
of tickets to sell.

49:34.138 --> 49:36.307
I don't like that man.

49:36.341 --> 49:39.444
I don't like what he brings out
in me or you or anyone.

49:39.477 --> 49:41.079
What if he brings out a crowd?

49:41.112 --> 49:42.447
Some things may not cost
what they appear to cost

49:42.480 --> 49:43.648
till it's too late.

49:43.681 --> 49:45.416
I'm boxed in here.
I gotta sell tickets.

49:45.450 --> 49:47.618
I gotta figure out who wins.
I gotta write the script.

49:47.652 --> 49:50.188
It is what it is, Jack.

49:50.221 --> 49:52.190
Every week, who's gonna win?
Who's gonna lose?

49:52.223 --> 49:54.325
-You just want us to win.
-I just want us to stop

49:54.359 --> 49:56.227
having the same
fuckin' conversation.

50:00.398 --> 50:02.533
Well, I didn't know
we had a limit on them.

50:02.567 --> 50:04.402
I didn't know when I said,
"Don't get a gerbil,"

50:04.435 --> 50:06.237
you'd turn around and tell
Thomas he could get one

50:06.270 --> 50:07.672
and then a gerbil
fuckin' shows up.

50:07.705 --> 50:09.006
Hey, Staci, it's just a gerbil.

50:09.040 --> 50:10.241
It's not just a gerbil, Jack.

50:10.274 --> 50:11.609
It's me expressing
something to you,

50:11.642 --> 50:13.010
you ignoring it, and deciding

50:13.044 --> 50:14.445
you don't give
a fuckin' shit about me.

50:14.479 --> 50:16.381
-Whoa, whoa, whoa.
-No whoa.

50:16.414 --> 50:18.383
You said you'd handle
the squirrels; you didn't.

50:18.416 --> 50:19.684
I put the christening
on the calendar;

50:19.717 --> 50:21.085
you scheduled other shit.

50:21.119 --> 50:22.787
I say no gerbil;
voilà, fuckin' gerbil.

50:23.020 --> 50:24.622
I spent two hours
trying catch to catch

50:24.655 --> 50:26.758
that stupid fuckin' desert rat
after Thomas dropped it,

50:26.791 --> 50:28.126
and you couldn't
catch fireflies

50:28.159 --> 50:29.761
for two precious seconds.

50:29.794 --> 50:31.162
I'm...

50:34.198 --> 50:37.335
I'm sorry about the gerbil,
the squirrels,

50:37.368 --> 50:39.170
and the fireflies.

50:40.104 --> 50:44.509
Jack, I think I just want
part of our life to be...

50:44.542 --> 50:48.513
proceeding towards
something unified.

50:48.546 --> 50:51.215
Are we talking
about Machu Picchu?

50:51.249 --> 50:53.384
No.

50:53.418 --> 50:56.287
It's about me. I need--

50:56.320 --> 50:58.823
I need a thing.

50:59.056 --> 51:02.126
Our family's a thing.
It's a great thing.

51:02.160 --> 51:04.562
It can be a great thing
and still--

51:07.064 --> 51:08.833
Yes, when I'm with you
and Thomas

51:09.066 --> 51:11.335
and we're doing stuff,
like, the three of us,

51:11.369 --> 51:13.070
I feel like I know who I am.

51:13.104 --> 51:15.072
I'm in a family.

51:15.106 --> 51:17.375
And whenever we're doing stuff
like going to church

51:17.408 --> 51:22.380
or-or fishing or being outside
catching fireflies

51:22.413 --> 51:25.249
that they're probably
gonna suffocate in a jar,

51:25.283 --> 51:27.418
I feel like I--

51:27.452 --> 51:30.822
I feel like
I'm building something,

51:30.855 --> 51:33.157
an amazing family, yet it--

51:34.525 --> 51:37.328
Lately, it's like
I'm just observing.

51:38.463 --> 51:40.531
And yes, it's supporting you,
but I don't wanna feel like

51:40.565 --> 51:42.800
it's all I can do,
just observe and support.

51:42.834 --> 51:44.402
It's not.

51:44.435 --> 51:46.437
I admire that you know
what you wanna do

51:46.471 --> 51:47.705
and that you do
what you gotta do

51:47.738 --> 51:50.808
in between what you wanna do
because you love us.

51:50.842 --> 51:53.177
And I appreciate
all you're doing to provide,

51:53.211 --> 51:57.181
but I don't think I'm made out
to just be a spectator.

51:57.215 --> 51:58.616
Me neither.

52:02.186 --> 52:03.621
I don't feel--

52:06.257 --> 52:07.725
I don't feel remarkable.

52:07.758 --> 52:09.260
Well, you are.

52:10.261 --> 52:11.662
And you're kind,

52:11.696 --> 52:14.632
compassionate,
you're forthright.

52:14.665 --> 52:16.234
You're always putting
others first.

52:16.267 --> 52:17.435
Yeah, well,
that's just behavior.

52:17.468 --> 52:20.605
That's not, you know,
specialness of character.

52:23.674 --> 52:25.877
Today the pastor asked us
to recall a moment

52:25.910 --> 52:28.813
where we were flourishing,

52:28.846 --> 52:31.349
and I thought about how since
Thomas went back to school

52:31.382 --> 52:33.484
and I finished painting
the bedrooms and the kitchen

52:33.518 --> 52:36.420
and how when you're at work
or the Dome, I just--

52:38.789 --> 52:41.826
I don't feel like
I got a handle on flourishing.

52:44.562 --> 52:46.931
I went to college.

52:47.164 --> 52:48.933
I'm a clerk at a grocery store.

52:55.206 --> 52:58.309
Maybe I have too much time
to think.

52:58.342 --> 53:00.311
Or just more than I expected.

53:00.344 --> 53:02.580
See, that's one of the reasons
I fell in love with you.

53:03.948 --> 53:06.684
I love the way you think.

53:06.717 --> 53:08.319
The way you are.

53:11.923 --> 53:15.393
I don't wanna mix up me
with Thomas' needs.

53:17.528 --> 53:20.765
He needs time with you
with your phone off.

53:20.798 --> 53:22.900
A day without plans.

53:22.934 --> 53:24.802
I hear you.

53:24.835 --> 53:26.304
And I know it's a cliché,

53:26.337 --> 53:27.838
but I'm burning the candle
at both ends right now.

53:27.872 --> 53:29.874
I understand,
but we need more.

53:29.907 --> 53:34.879
We need more than just
an exhausted and depleted you.

53:34.912 --> 53:37.848
We need you to build us up too.

53:37.882 --> 53:39.550
And Thomas needs more from you.

53:39.584 --> 53:41.619
He needs more from you
than an example of a guy

53:41.652 --> 53:44.555
who works hard and burns
the candle at both ends.

53:44.589 --> 53:45.823
I could take him
by the lawn shop

53:45.856 --> 53:48.693
and show him what
eating shit looks like.

53:48.726 --> 53:50.761
Jack, I think the whole
unifying thing is just--

53:50.795 --> 53:52.964
I would like to be a voice
you appreciate hearing.

53:52.997 --> 53:55.399
I would love to think
that when I have an opinion,

53:55.433 --> 53:56.901
it's valued
with the intention of it

53:56.934 --> 53:58.803
being something good for us.

54:04.942 --> 54:07.678
I don't want to be a scold
or that kind of person.

54:07.712 --> 54:10.615
No. You're not, okay?

54:12.683 --> 54:15.319
You're a beautiful wife,

54:15.353 --> 54:17.855
and you're my best friend.

54:40.611 --> 54:42.947
Confident, Jack.
Poised and confident!

54:42.980 --> 54:44.715
That kid's got flair.

54:44.749 --> 54:47.885
Look at the proud papa.

54:47.918 --> 54:49.520
Let me tell you right now,

54:49.553 --> 54:51.689
Ace Spade is gonna be
the first kid from Duffy

54:51.722 --> 54:53.924
to start quarterback
for the Georgia Bulldogs,

54:53.958 --> 54:56.627
and then he's going
straight to the NFL.

54:56.661 --> 54:57.828
Oh, come on, Tom.

54:57.862 --> 54:59.563
Don't put expectations
on the kid.

54:59.597 --> 55:01.499
It's not expectations, honey.

55:01.532 --> 55:02.767
Destiny.

55:02.800 --> 55:05.636
Destined for greatness,
this kid.

55:05.670 --> 55:07.805
Ace Spade
is the Can't-Miss Kid.
