WEBVTT

00:01.109 --> 00:02.148
We know who took the boy.

00:02.148 --> 00:03.884
He kidnapped a 5-year-old two years ago.

00:03.884 --> 00:06.848
Anything the FBI or the police do,
we have limitations.

00:06.848 --> 00:09.122
What a private citizen does, however…

00:09.157 --> 00:10.004
You're not going in there.

00:10.004 --> 00:12.237
I will give you to the count of three.
If you do not unlock it…

00:12.237 --> 00:13.617
I'm calling the police.

00:16.053 --> 00:17.562
–Brad!
–You wouldn't dare.

00:17.562 --> 00:18.510
Three.

00:18.545 --> 00:19.458
Okay!

00:21.765 --> 00:23.372
Nobody's arrested us yet.

00:23.407 --> 00:24.979
The FBI won't. I know that.

00:24.979 --> 00:28.214
I think we saved our skin
with a happy ending.

01:00.651 --> 01:02.862
I'll take the blonde.

01:05.269 --> 01:08.921
–Melissa, what are we doing in jail?
–They're saying I tried to rob a bank.

01:08.921 --> 01:11.546
I didn't. I just smashed a window.

01:11.581 --> 01:13.678
And they say I'm a prostitute.

01:13.713 --> 01:16.569
–Which is ridiculous.
–Back off, Ho.

01:17.180 --> 01:19.137
–What did you say?
–Come on.

01:19.172 --> 01:20.766
Liz?

01:20.974 --> 01:22.462
Alan?

01:22.976 --> 01:25.859
Oh, my God! You just dropped off
the side of the earth.

01:25.859 --> 01:27.292
I was in a relationship.

01:27.292 --> 01:28.335
But now I'm not.

01:28.370 --> 01:30.589
–You still at 1-800-LIZZIE?
–Whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:30.589 --> 01:31.925
Whoa. Hey! Remember me?

01:31.925 --> 01:34.599
I'm in trouble here. They arrested me.

01:34.746 --> 01:35.683
You're arresting me?

01:35.683 --> 01:37.282
Please, put your hands
behind your back, sir.

01:37.282 --> 01:38.458
You gotta be kidding.

01:38.458 --> 01:39.716
You have the right to remain silent.

01:39.716 --> 01:41.299
–I know my rights.
–What's going on?

01:41.299 --> 01:43.225
They're arresting me
for assaulting the priest.

01:43.225 --> 01:45.255
And kidnapping and false imprisonment.

01:45.255 --> 01:47.274
–Now you have the right to an attorney…
–Son. Son.

01:47.274 --> 01:49.003
This is the United States of America.

01:49.003 --> 01:51.649
We don't really believe in Miranda anymore.

01:51.684 --> 01:52.427
Let's go.

01:52.462 --> 01:55.889
Hey, hey, hey, hey! Ah, Denny Crane.
I'll handle this internally.

01:55.889 --> 01:57.757
Sir, this man's being charged
with three felonies.

01:57.757 --> 01:59.170
Understood, but…

01:59.205 --> 02:00.533
Denny Crane.

02:00.568 --> 02:01.826
Come on.

02:01.861 --> 02:03.733
Hey, hey, hey, hey. Come on!

02:03.768 --> 02:05.253
With all that's going on in the world today,

02:05.253 --> 02:09.967
who among us hasn't at least once
wanted to take an axe to a priest?

02:10.002 --> 02:11.579
Come on.

02:14.205 --> 02:15.471
They're arresting him?

02:15.471 --> 02:17.951
And I gave it my best shot.

02:49.470 --> 02:51.449
So they're not pressing charges.

02:52.183 --> 02:53.429
They're not pressing charges?

02:53.429 --> 02:56.186
If you make restitution for the window,
they've agreed not pursuing…

02:56.186 --> 02:57.867
No.

02:59.263 --> 03:01.158
I'm sorry. Did you say no?

03:01.193 --> 03:04.714
I'm not paying for their stupid window. Forget it.

03:06.081 --> 03:09.430
–Melissa, you smashed it.
–After what they've done to me!

03:09.430 --> 03:12.709
Perhaps you should tell me exactly
what they've done to you.

03:12.709 --> 03:16.634
My credit card bills. You're aware
I have some uh, fiscal issues?

03:16.669 --> 03:17.627
It's come up.

03:17.662 --> 03:19.822
So a few months ago, I owe one amount.

03:19.822 --> 03:21.912
The next month it, it like triples.

03:21.912 --> 03:24.489
So I stop buying stuff and the next month,
bam, it's even higher.

03:24.489 --> 03:27.502
So I call the 800 number. Not LIZZIE.

03:27.537 --> 03:30.480
And who answers? But Ms Jones, yes.

03:30.515 --> 03:33.851
From New Delhi. India.
Not Brighton and not Melrose India.

03:33.851 --> 03:35.699
I mean, surprised she's not
terribly helpful, right?

03:35.699 --> 03:37.036
So far I'm on her side.

03:37.036 --> 03:40.185
And I talked to her supervisor
who says that I owe this money, plus more.

03:40.185 --> 03:43.286
This doesn't make any sense!
I need to talk to someone in America.

03:43.286 --> 03:44.270
Hello?

03:44.305 --> 03:48.185
So all I can get is an address for Prominence's
main office in Wilmington, Delaware.

03:48.185 --> 03:52.030
Like I can afford to go there.
So I call them, I get a local office, I go there…

03:52.030 --> 03:56.693
and it's basically just a store front.
–With a big window.

03:56.728 --> 04:00.253
–I'm not paying for it.
–You are paying for it.

04:00.288 --> 04:03.457
And I wanna see those credit card bills.

04:03.492 --> 04:05.652
What? Suddenly you're my father now?

04:07.997 --> 04:09.615
Yes, sir.

04:15.613 --> 04:19.873
321113, commonwealth vs Bradley Chase.

04:19.908 --> 04:22.383
–Assault with a deadly weapon…
–Waive reading, judge,

04:22.383 --> 04:27.442
and ask that these ridiculous charges
be dismissed on the grounds of ridiculousness.

04:27.477 --> 04:29.848
These charges are anything
but ridiculous, your honor.

04:29.848 --> 04:33.621
The defendant abducted one innocent man,
threatened him with torture.

04:33.621 --> 04:35.278
Then assaulted clergy with a deadly weapon!'

04:35.278 --> 04:37.386
–Pick, pick, pick, pick, pick.
–You think this is funny?

04:37.386 --> 04:40.086
Your honor, my client saved the innocent life

04:40.100 --> 04:45.532
of a little kidnapped child
who was innocent and utterly…

04:45.875 --> 04:46.937
kidnapped.

04:46.972 --> 04:49.588
I watch the news like everyone else, Mr Crane.

04:49.588 --> 04:51.907
And your client's conduct was shocking.

04:51.907 --> 04:54.006
Your honor, I'd like to move
for an immediate trial.

04:54.006 --> 04:55.716
–Hold on!
–The facts are not in dispute.

04:55.716 --> 04:58.290
The district attorney clearly
wants his fifteen minutes.

04:58.290 --> 04:59.507
Why should we make him wait?

04:59.507 --> 05:01.148
If you think this is about me
grabbing a spotlight…

05:01.148 --> 05:02.448
It's always about that with you, Frank.

05:02.448 --> 05:04.781
You've been running for office
since you got out of law school.

05:04.781 --> 05:05.459
Hold on!

05:05.460 --> 05:07.826
You two will refrain from personal exchanges.

05:07.826 --> 05:08.688
But it is personal, your honor.

05:08.688 --> 05:11.976
We have a history and the opportunity
for him to saddle me up as a cause.

05:11.976 --> 05:13.294
You attacked a man.

05:13.329 --> 05:14.977
Cutting off his fingers.

05:15.012 --> 05:18.170
As someone who took an oath
to uphold the law, yes,

05:18.205 --> 05:19.673
I take that personally.

05:19.708 --> 05:22.544
It's a sound bite, Frank.
Might wanna save it for the cameras.

05:22.544 --> 05:25.018
Which they'll be asking you
to allow in court.

05:25.018 --> 05:26.516
I consent.
–Hey!

05:26.551 --> 05:30.446
I will make the rules in this courtroom.

05:30.481 --> 05:32.233
Are you ready to proceed to trial?

05:32.233 --> 05:34.654
Assuming he's not alleging
any diminished capacity.

05:34.654 --> 05:37.044
I will plead not guilty
on the grounds of necessity.

05:37.044 --> 05:37.737
Necessity?

05:37.738 --> 05:39.735
Yes. You probably skipped over it
in law school.

05:39.735 --> 05:41.233
Necessity.

05:41.268 --> 05:42.844
Look it up, hack.

05:42.879 --> 05:44.333
The commonwealth is ready to proceed.

05:44.333 --> 05:46.528
I must caution you both.

05:46.563 --> 05:49.132
These are serious criminal charges here.

05:49.167 --> 05:52.619
I'm not sure you should want
to rush to judgment.

05:52.654 --> 05:56.200
Judge, you're old. I'm old.

05:56.235 --> 05:59.237
Lock and load. Before we're dead.

06:04.763 --> 06:07.888
Why in God's name did you press
for an immediate trial?

06:07.888 --> 06:10.944
Because I want to trade
on the currency of being a hero.

06:10.944 --> 06:13.552
I've been featured all over the news
and the jury pool is watching.

06:13.552 --> 06:16.126
–Even so, a conviction here means prison.
–I won't be convicted.

06:16.126 --> 06:18.400
How can you be sure of that?
Especially since you're guilty.

06:18.400 --> 06:19.404
Denny Crane.

06:19.439 --> 06:21.439
Look, I know this assistant DA.

06:21.474 --> 06:24.264
He wants to be the DA. He's using
this as a publicity…

06:24.264 --> 06:26.268
He's also good. I've seen him try cases.

06:26.268 --> 06:29.715
–Denny Crane.
–That is not a legal defense.

06:31.982 --> 06:33.889
Are we happy?

06:33.924 --> 06:35.729
Did I not warn both of you?

06:35.764 --> 06:37.980
You know what Shirley? Don't start.

06:38.015 --> 06:41.121
I changed that little boy's diaper.  I
would do anything to get him back.

06:41.121 --> 06:42.033
Clearly.

06:42.068 --> 06:42.982
Including going to jail.

06:42.982 --> 06:44.384
Which it come to for Brad.

06:44.384 --> 06:46.554
All right, we're all on the same side here.

06:46.554 --> 06:48.776
Really? I'm not so sure.

06:48.811 --> 06:54.587
Denise, if I were against you,
I'd leave no doubt.

06:56.485 --> 07:00.096
You're really planning to have
Denny handle your defense?

07:01.077 --> 07:02.963
Well…

07:03.957 --> 07:08.299
Denny, given the exposure of this case,
not only to Brad but the firm,

07:08.334 --> 07:10.802
how about you and I team up on this?

07:10.837 --> 07:12.280
I'd love it.

07:12.315 --> 07:14.511
–I'll pitch.
–I'll call balls and strikes.

07:14.511 --> 07:17.838
We'll all need to sign waivers and Denise,
I'm gonna need to call you as a witness,

07:17.838 --> 07:20.752
but before you say yes, you need
to consider the liability.

07:20.752 --> 07:21.371
Yes.

07:21.372 --> 07:22.509
Not so fast.

07:22.544 --> 07:24.942
They could charge you with conspiracy,
or aiding and abetting…

07:24.942 --> 07:27.891
I said yes. I'll testify.

07:36.646 --> 07:40.079
Melissa, you're fifty thousand dollars in debt.

07:40.127 --> 07:42.185
–I know.
–How did this happen?

07:42.220 --> 07:44.525
I don't know. I swear. It's these people.

07:44.525 --> 07:45.656
They've ruined me.

07:45.691 --> 07:46.753
Going to trial.

07:46.788 --> 07:48.387
I'm swelling up just thinking about it.

07:48.387 --> 07:52.284
Trials make me swell with adrenalin.
Do I look swollen?

07:52.319 --> 07:54.115
Somewhat.

07:54.394 --> 07:56.132
Denny, we're a little busy here.

07:56.132 --> 07:57.369
What are you doing?

07:57.404 --> 07:58.992
Taxes? Don't you have an accountant?

07:58.992 --> 08:03.378
I'm helping Melissa who seems to have
fallen into a black hole of debt.

08:03.413 --> 08:05.219
Very black.

08:05.254 --> 08:08.264
What is this sudden concern of yours
for people without money?

08:08.264 --> 08:11.430
–I need to know.
–You need to look at the big picture.

08:11.430 --> 08:14.561
If people don't have it,
they might wanna steal ours.

08:14.561 --> 08:15.530
Right.

08:15.565 --> 08:19.825
Do we have anybody in corporate
who understands this credit card world?

08:19.853 --> 08:21.899
Somebody…
–Hands.

08:21.934 --> 08:23.935
–Sorry?
–Hands Espenson.

08:23.970 --> 08:26.539
Banking and finance genius.
Only don't call him Hands.

08:26.539 --> 08:29.458
Why would I? Why do you?

08:29.493 --> 08:32.280
The contract was deliberately written
to confuse you.

08:32.280 --> 08:34.559
Bait and switch. Bingo!

08:34.595 --> 08:37.429
Promise one thing, say, zero percent interest.

08:37.465 --> 08:39.626
Then they up it to thirty percent. Bingo!

08:39.626 --> 08:41.719
–But, isn't that illegal?
–Used to be.

08:41.719 --> 08:46.336
Used to have usury laws but the States
wanted the credit card business,

08:46.371 --> 08:49.651
so poof! Gone! Bingo!

08:49.686 --> 08:51.816
Ever inquire about a car loan?

08:51.851 --> 08:53.912
–Actually, yes, once.
–Bingo!

08:53.947 --> 08:55.834
–But I didn't buy the car.
–It doesn't matter.

08:55.834 --> 08:57.931
It's called universal default.

08:57.966 --> 09:01.293
Credit bureaus share your information. All of it.

09:01.328 --> 09:06.636
Your credit card company just heard
about your asking for a car loan. Bingo!

09:06.671 --> 09:09.490
They raise your rates.
Why? Because they can.

09:09.525 --> 09:10.818
Why doesn't he move his hands?

09:10.818 --> 09:13.978
The OCC is supposed to police, they don't.

09:14.013 --> 09:17.139
Bought off by the credit card lobbyists.

09:20.132 --> 09:23.021
Is he coming back?

09:27.273 --> 09:30.097
I have no idea.

09:37.546 --> 09:39.304
What's your history with this DA?

09:39.304 --> 09:41.898
We went to law school together.
I beat his ass in moot court.

09:41.898 --> 09:44.280
I licked him several times
in criminal cases since.

09:44.280 --> 09:45.695
Let's just say that we're rivals.

09:45.695 --> 09:48.268
Denise, I'll take your testimony.
Denny, can you take Brad's?

09:48.268 --> 09:51.230
You licked a man's ass?

09:51.265 --> 09:54.924
Denny, if you can't focus here,
I'm not going to let you play.

09:54.924 --> 09:57.098
This trial is a threat to Brad's freedom.

09:57.098 --> 10:00.091
It is potentially an enormous blight
on this firm.

10:00.091 --> 10:02.864
–We need to win this trial.
–I'm sorry.

10:02.899 --> 10:06.082
But, tell me again why it is
that we're rushing this so?

10:06.082 --> 10:10.751
It's a rush job because Ginsberg plans to run
for district attorney in the primaries in March.

10:10.751 --> 10:13.475
–He's using this as a showcase to…
–That explains his urgency.

10:13.475 --> 10:14.644
What about ours?

10:14.679 --> 10:18.726
At the moment, Brad's a celebrity. His
hero status can only run to our favor.

10:18.726 --> 10:19.838
But it is a risk.

10:19.873 --> 10:23.697
It's not too late to take a deep breath
and say ‘let's do this later’.

10:23.697 --> 10:25.388
Let's do it now.

10:25.423 --> 10:27.045
You're sure?

10:27.080 --> 10:29.401
I have an erection.

10:29.633 --> 10:31.733
It's a good sign.

10:32.292 --> 10:34.907
Let the trial begin.

10:35.066 --> 10:36.931
I'm ready.

10:51.152 --> 10:52.278
Denny Crane.

10:52.431 --> 10:53.317
–Excuse us.
–Denny Crane.

10:53.317 --> 10:55.021
–Excuse us, please.
–My poop doesn't smell.

10:55.021 --> 10:56.048
We have no comment.

10:56.048 --> 10:57.350
Comes out in pretty colors.

10:57.350 --> 10:59.403
Pastels. Denny Crane.

10:59.687 --> 11:00.944
Denny Crane.

11:00.979 --> 11:03.860
And suddenly he's swinging the axe.

11:03.895 --> 11:06.707
I, I put my hand out and he chopped it.

11:06.742 --> 11:11.062
He cut three of my fingers right off,
they, they just fell to the floor.

11:11.078 --> 11:15.345
–And then what happened, sir?
–Well, I was rushed to the hospital.

11:15.380 --> 11:18.200
Two of my fingers were
recovered and reattached,

11:18.200 --> 11:23.391
and then his colleague, that woman,
came in brandishing my third finger.

11:23.426 --> 11:29.400
She wouldn't give it back unless I revealed
privileged information about
one of my parishioners.

11:29.435 --> 11:33.582
He cut it off, and she extorted me with it.

11:33.790 --> 11:36.896
My first question would be,

11:36.931 --> 11:40.047
if someone is swinging an axe,
why stick your hand out?

11:40.047 --> 11:41.676
I didn't think he'd actually try it.

11:41.676 --> 11:44.443
And to be clear, when you speak
of your parishioner,

11:44.443 --> 11:47.560
you refer to the man charged with
kidnapping the child.

11:47.560 --> 11:48.496
Well, yes.

11:48.497 --> 11:52.481
And also to be clear, you knew your
parishioner was a pedophile.

11:52.516 --> 11:56.423
I am not going to reveal
privileged information to you,

11:56.458 --> 11:58.080
just like I wouldn't to him.

11:58.080 --> 12:00.862
But you did reveal information
to Ms Bauer.

12:00.897 --> 12:03.454
You told her where
your parishioner's hide-away was.

12:03.454 --> 12:06.195
You'll reveal privileged information
to get your fingers back,

12:06.195 --> 12:08.230
but not to save the life of a child.

12:08.230 --> 12:09.852
–Objection.
–Sustained.

12:09.887 --> 12:13.923
As a policy, if a pedophile killer confesses
his crime, you'll protect that secret?

12:13.923 --> 12:17.460
I cannot break the confessional seal.

12:17.495 --> 12:18.867
It's Canon law.

12:18.902 --> 12:20.832
–Is that stupid?
–Objection.

12:20.867 --> 12:25.646
I'm sorry, but the laws in this country
to protect again child-abuse supersede

12:25.681 --> 12:28.620
doctor-patient privilege,
lawyer-client privilege,

12:28.620 --> 12:31.445
but not priest-parishioner privilege?

12:31.480 --> 12:35.644
Has the Catholic church earned some special
exemption when it comes to pedophiles?

12:35.644 --> 12:38.173
–Objection!
–Do we trust them more in this area?

12:38.173 --> 12:39.639
That's a cheap shot.

12:39.674 --> 12:41.777
I've been known to take them.

12:41.812 --> 12:45.289
Tell us about the Papal Blessings.

12:45.324 --> 12:46.688
Well…

12:46.723 --> 12:50.217
On that matter, I, I was, uh…

12:50.662 --> 12:52.378
I was wayward.

12:52.413 --> 12:54.059
I apologize.

12:54.094 --> 12:57.911
The Vatican issues Papal Blessings
at about thirty dollars a pop.

12:57.911 --> 13:01.198
You decided to print them yourself
and sell them directly,

13:01.198 --> 13:05.792
bypassing the middleman, who in this
case, happens to be the Pope.

13:05.827 --> 13:09.089
Yes. As, as I said, I was wayward there.

13:09.124 --> 13:12.352
I'm just having a hard time reconciling.

13:12.387 --> 13:14.450
You'll steal from the Pope,

13:14.485 --> 13:18.756
but cloak yourself in Canon law when
it comes to protecting a pedophile.

13:18.756 --> 13:20.744
–Do you support pedophilia?
–Objection!

13:20.744 --> 13:23.226
Do I dare ask where those
three fingers had been prior

13:23.226 --> 13:25.517
to my client's chopping them off?
–Objection!

13:25.517 --> 13:28.925
Ms Schmidt, you are way out of line.

13:28.960 --> 13:29.959
I'm sorry, judge.

13:29.959 --> 13:33.949
I have known many many
wonderful priests in my lifetime.

13:33.984 --> 13:38.031
I am not adding Father Ryan to that list.

13:38.346 --> 13:40.805
Nothing further.

13:53.449 --> 13:56.920
Wait a second.  So the deadbeats are
the ones who pay off their debt?

13:56.920 --> 13:57.685
Bingo!

13:57.720 --> 13:59.820
Within the credit card industry,
they're called deadbeats

13:59.820 --> 14:01.511
because they don't make
any money off of them.

14:01.511 --> 14:02.881
The ones who don't pay off,

14:02.881 --> 14:06.375
they're the preferred customers because
they're the ones they make money off of.

14:06.375 --> 14:09.798
They target people they know
won't be able to pay.

14:09.833 --> 14:11.611
People like Melissa.

14:11.646 --> 14:13.207
Bingo!

14:13.710 --> 14:15.692
You making fun of me?

14:15.727 --> 14:17.166
No, sir.

14:17.201 --> 14:19.215
You said what I say. That's making fun.

14:19.215 --> 14:22.013
No! It's just…

14:22.716 --> 14:28.363
I used to have a dog you see,
and Bingo was his name.  Oh, B, I…

14:28.398 --> 14:29.772
Never mind.

14:29.807 --> 14:31.111
How we doing?

14:31.146 --> 14:32.745
We're suing them.

14:32.780 --> 14:33.546
Who?

14:33.581 --> 14:34.991
The company that gave you
the credit card.

14:34.991 --> 14:36.989
–Prominence Bank.
–We, we're suing them?

14:36.989 --> 14:38.952
We can't sue, can't sue.
Too big, too big.

14:38.952 --> 14:41.685
The bigger they are, Jerry.

14:43.036 --> 14:45.596
We're suing them.

14:47.040 --> 14:49.130
What do you mean I'm not testifying?

14:49.130 --> 14:52.130
The problem is, if Brad testifies and you testify,

14:52.157 --> 14:55.115
that gives the prosecution
two more opportunities

14:55.150 --> 14:57.877
to play out this horrific chain of events.

14:57.912 --> 15:00.336
There's nothing you can say
that Brad can't say.

15:00.336 --> 15:02.884
–I can support what he says.
–True.

15:02.919 --> 15:07.379
But since you're the one that twiddled
the severed finger using it
for blackmail purposes,

15:07.379 --> 15:09.886
there's the outside chance
you'll come off as less than adorable.

15:09.886 --> 15:10.367
Shirley…

15:10.402 --> 15:13.421
Denise, the DA will have a field day.

15:13.948 --> 15:15.554
–You ready?
–I am.

15:15.589 --> 15:18.720
More importantly, are you ready?

15:18.755 --> 15:21.149
Lock and…

15:22.610 --> 15:24.325
Denny, maybe I should take this.

15:24.325 --> 15:26.824
Shirley, if the jury doesn't get
to see me in action,

15:26.824 --> 15:29.288
they'll feel cheated.
They'll think we cheated them.

15:29.288 --> 15:30.979
Walk them through what happened,

15:30.979 --> 15:34.119
giving Brad a chance to explain
why he did what he did and…

15:34.119 --> 15:37.064
I know how to question a witness, Shirley.

15:37.099 --> 15:40.009
Denny, our whole case is his testimony.

15:40.044 --> 15:41.312
Whose?

15:42.568 --> 15:45.916
Kidding. I'm ready.

15:47.000 --> 15:51.204
Just for fun, show me
how you plan to start off.

15:51.239 --> 15:55.409
‘Brad, what occasioned you
to even get involved,

15:55.444 --> 15:57.506
pretending to be an FBI officer?’

15:57.541 --> 15:59.720
His response will occasion the jury to feel

15:59.720 --> 16:02.669
and experience the horror of a child
being kidnapped.

16:02.669 --> 16:04.670
Like it was their child.

16:04.705 --> 16:06.880
–Good.
–There.

16:06.915 --> 16:09.855
You must show contrition.
You must be apologetic.

16:09.871 --> 16:12.194
You did what you did
to get the child back,

16:12.194 --> 16:15.930
but you feel compassion and sympathy
for everybody you victimized.

16:15.930 --> 16:16.609
Got it.

16:16.701 --> 16:18.620
Do not make yourself the story.

16:18.655 --> 16:21.111
The jury needs to be focused on him.

16:21.843 --> 16:25.233
Did you just say don't make me the story?

16:31.532 --> 16:33.390
He's coming here? Tomorrow?

16:33.425 --> 16:35.845
–Claiming he wants to work things out.
–Can't meet, can't meet.

16:35.845 --> 16:38.233
–What do you mean you can't meet?
–I don't do meetings.

16:38.233 --> 16:39.293
I'm background.

16:39.328 --> 16:42.696
You've got all the expertise, Jerry,
and I need you to be around.

16:42.696 --> 16:46.016
–I'll give you a memo.
–Just a whisper in my ear.

16:46.051 --> 16:50.431
You won't even have to talk out loud.
And I'll do all the gesturing.

16:50.866 --> 16:55.946
I'm sorry.  That was an extremely
poor joke and I apologize.

16:56.553 --> 16:58.965
Is he like the president of the company? Or…

16:58.965 --> 17:02.260
He's their general counsel, actually.
Happens to be in Boston.

17:02.260 --> 17:05.032
Jerry, I'm sorry.

17:05.502 --> 17:07.137
I need you.

17:09.693 --> 17:11.156
I'll be present.

17:11.199 --> 17:15.109
I'll give feedback on my computer.
You can read it off the screen.

17:15.109 --> 17:17.114
Deal!

17:36.459 --> 17:39.283
I am so sorry.

17:39.318 --> 17:41.474
I'm the one who led you into all this.

17:41.474 --> 17:45.397
You have nothing to apologize for,
Denise.  I made my own decision.

17:45.397 --> 17:49.286
But a week ago you were up for partner,
and now you're up on trial.

17:49.286 --> 17:53.046
Denise, the little boy is alive.

17:53.219 --> 17:55.731
Unfortunately that's not the issue.

17:55.766 --> 17:57.966
Well, it is for me.

18:00.689 --> 18:02.640
Are you always like this?

18:02.675 --> 18:04.612
Like what?

18:04.647 --> 18:08.126
Brad, you could be looking at jail.

18:08.161 --> 18:11.605
It's okay to show a little fear.

18:11.640 --> 18:13.540
Okay.

18:13.728 --> 18:15.538
Thanks.

18:16.288 --> 18:19.499
Okay. Thanks. That's it?

18:19.534 --> 18:21.310
Denise, what do you want me to do?

18:21.310 --> 18:23.254
Cry? We got the kid back.

18:23.289 --> 18:26.791
If I had to do it all over again,
I would do it again.

18:26.826 --> 18:30.144
I'll live with the consequences.

18:30.881 --> 18:32.418
Okay.

18:35.904 --> 18:37.844
So I'll see you in court.

18:37.879 --> 18:38.854
Yep.

19:03.578 --> 19:06.518
How's my hair? Does my hair work?

19:06.553 --> 19:08.696
It does appear to grow each month.

19:08.731 --> 19:10.840
It's my first settlement conference.

19:10.840 --> 19:12.835
There is a lot of power
in a woman's hair.

19:12.835 --> 19:14.525
Yes, there is.

19:14.914 --> 19:19.774
I think we'll let my slightly less
powerful hair run the meeting.

19:20.943 --> 19:22.274
Good morning.

19:22.309 --> 19:23.690
Melvin Palmer. How are you?

19:23.690 --> 19:26.991
I'm grand, actually but I go by Alan Shore.

19:27.026 --> 19:28.246
A pleasure.

19:28.281 --> 19:29.796
This is Melissa Hughes.

19:29.831 --> 19:31.311
I would be your plaintiff.

19:31.311 --> 19:34.892
And real honor to meet you, Melissa.

19:35.169 --> 19:36.636
Melvin Palmer.

19:36.671 --> 19:39.585
Jerry Espenson. He doesn't shake.

19:39.620 --> 19:43.436
Excellent! Well then, shall we get started?

19:44.063 --> 19:46.382
You're not gonna be cheerful
about all this, are you?

19:46.382 --> 19:48.666
You know, I have been told
to keep my exuberance down

19:48.666 --> 19:52.054
until people have had their morning coffee.

19:52.089 --> 19:54.692
Let me tell you a little about me.

19:54.964 --> 19:55.908
Oh, dear.

19:55.943 --> 19:59.626
I am a problem solver. It's what I love to do.

19:59.661 --> 20:03.250
Now I consider it a personal failure
when one of my cases ends up in court.

20:03.250 --> 20:07.292
I also feel I haven't succeeded when people
walk away from one of my tables unhappy.

20:07.292 --> 20:08.714
It's actually our table.

20:08.714 --> 20:12.521
What I do in matters like this?  I set
aside my whole day, okay?

20:12.521 --> 20:14.994
Because the goal is finding a solution.

20:15.029 --> 20:17.674
One that works for you, and one that works for us.

20:17.674 --> 20:19.671
That's just the way I work.

20:19.706 --> 20:22.740
So this doesn't have to be
an acrimonious experience.

20:22.740 --> 20:23.633
Wonderful.

20:23.668 --> 20:28.024
Why don't we begin then by you
giving her back all her money?

20:28.059 --> 20:29.944
Well, well…

20:29.979 --> 20:31.564
I don't know if we can do that.

20:31.564 --> 20:34.984
But I do think we can make
this pretty young woman happy.

20:34.998 --> 20:36.748
Okay, then.

20:37.078 --> 20:38.935
We have this saying in Texas,

20:38.970 --> 20:43.277
Time to let the horses out of the barn.

20:49.032 --> 20:50.462
You swear to tell the truth,
the whole truth

20:50.462 --> 20:52.270
and nothing but the truth,
so help you God?

20:52.270 --> 20:52.904
I do.

20:56.873 --> 20:58.594
Denny!

21:02.482 --> 21:05.936
First off, if it had been my child
who had been kidnapped,

21:05.936 --> 21:09.122
there are no words that could express
my gratitude.  I'm sure we all agree.

21:09.122 --> 21:09.869
Objection.

21:09.904 --> 21:12.829
Mr Crane, do not address the jury.

21:12.864 --> 21:14.100
Oh, I'm sorry.

21:14.135 --> 21:17.755
Brad, first question.

21:17.790 --> 21:20.793
I got involved because my colleague
Denise Bauer came to me distraught

21:20.793 --> 21:22.692
that her housekeeper's child
had been kidnapped

21:22.692 --> 21:25.644
and frustrated the police and FBI
were making no progress.

21:25.644 --> 21:26.410
Second question.

21:26.410 --> 21:30.011
I went to a friend of mine Kevin Drummond
at the FBI and asked him for help.

21:30.011 --> 21:30.790
Third question.

21:30.790 --> 21:33.264
He told me that while the FBI
was limited by State action

21:33.264 --> 21:37.400
that private citizens had sometimes
successfully taken things into their own hands.

21:37.400 --> 21:38.341
Fourth question.

21:38.341 --> 21:39.728
Objection. He's not asking any questions.

21:39.728 --> 21:41.920
I told him last night the questions
I was gonna ask him.

21:41.920 --> 21:44.043
Judge, I'm just trying
to speed things up for the jury

21:44.043 --> 21:47.958
who I know are already annoyed at even
being here for this ridiculous prosecution.

21:47.958 --> 21:48.804
Objection.

21:48.839 --> 21:49.651
Mr Crane…

21:49.652 --> 21:51.823
Call me Denny, judge. Denny Crane.

21:51.858 --> 21:54.229
You will ask the question in their entirety,

21:54.229 --> 21:57.278
so that we may understand what
the witness is answering.

21:57.278 --> 22:00.091
–Outrageous!
–You kidnapped an innocent man?

22:00.126 --> 22:01.599
Now the brother wasn't so innocent.

22:01.599 --> 22:06.173
He'd provided safe harbor for the
suspect, and he had information.

22:06.208 --> 22:08.801
–So that's when you used violence?
–Threatened violence.

22:08.801 --> 22:09.803
–Only threatened?
–Only threatened.

22:09.803 --> 22:10.782
–Didn't use it?
–Did not.

22:10.782 --> 22:11.555
What a fiend.

22:11.555 --> 22:13.624
He's making light of a kidnapping,
false imprisonment…

22:13.624 --> 22:14.383
Objection!

22:14.418 --> 22:15.287
You're a witness.

22:15.287 --> 22:17.233
–Objection! Objection!
–Objection!

22:17.233 --> 22:18.906
Stop it!

22:19.351 --> 22:20.923
None of us is making light
of this, judge.

22:20.923 --> 22:22.894
We're just trying to put
some perspective on things.

22:22.894 --> 22:24.783
–There is no question before the witness.
–Sustained.

22:24.783 --> 22:26.638
–What can you tell us about perspective?
–Objection.

22:26.638 --> 22:28.757
–That's a question!
–Sustained.

22:28.792 --> 22:31.341
–The brother told you about the priest?
–Yes.

22:31.341 --> 22:33.982
And that's when you went to the church
and cut off his fingers?

22:33.982 --> 22:36.589
I swung an axe at his imported door
knowing it cost a lot of money.

22:36.589 --> 22:37.656
–How much?
–Nine thousand.

22:37.656 --> 22:38.429
–Dollars?
–Dollars.

22:38.429 --> 22:39.967
–For a door?
–He somehow could afford it.

22:39.967 --> 22:41.405
–Objection.
–Bitch, bitch.

22:41.405 --> 22:42.831
–Mr Crane!
–Call me Denny, judge.

22:42.831 --> 22:45.703
–No, I will not call you Denny!
–So you swung at the door?

22:45.703 --> 22:48.540
I only wanted to make him think that
I was about to destroy the door

22:48.540 --> 22:50.772
and he stuck his hand out right
at the last second.

22:50.772 --> 22:52.969
I never meant to make contact.
It was an accident.

22:52.969 --> 22:55.184
You didn't mean to hit his hand?

22:55.219 --> 22:57.365
No. And I regret that I did.

22:57.400 --> 23:01.032
To the extent that it led to the safe recovery
of Tito Perez, I'm glad about that.

23:01.032 --> 23:04.762
But I never meant to cause
any physical injury to Father Ryan.

23:04.797 --> 23:09.258
And again, I apologize.

23:14.968 --> 23:17.071
Denny Crane. Fair and balanced.

23:17.106 --> 23:19.175
The nut job. Fair and balanced.

23:19.210 --> 23:21.032
Denny Crane.

23:28.337 --> 23:30.214
That was you not becoming the story?

23:30.214 --> 23:32.679
–I was practically invisible.
–What the hell was that about?

23:32.679 --> 23:35.284
The prosecutor wants to horrify the jury.

23:35.319 --> 23:37.339
We were diluting the horror…scope.

23:37.339 --> 23:39.259
To my money, you trivialized it.

23:39.290 --> 23:41.405
You may have just alienated the jury.

23:41.405 --> 23:42.633
People like a happy ending.

23:42.633 --> 23:45.013
The child came home safe.
We play the happy ending.

23:45.013 --> 23:47.358
–It's not that simple, Denny.
–Yes, it is, Shirley.

23:47.358 --> 23:49.246
We're talking juries.

23:49.281 --> 23:51.812
It always comes down to simple.

23:51.847 --> 23:56.143
And, I mean, there's nobody
simpler than me.

24:03.938 --> 24:07.005
–Please tell me you're making this up.
–I am not.

24:07.040 --> 24:10.471
He said, question one, question two,
question three and so forth.

24:10.471 --> 24:13.739
Almost as if he were deliberately
mocking the whole proceeding.

24:13.739 --> 24:16.972
–And we could very well lose, Paul.
–Is he out of his mind?

24:16.972 --> 24:18.164
Well, he's always out of it.

24:18.164 --> 24:19.903
Clearly it's where he's most comfortable.

24:19.903 --> 24:21.659
What are you doing in my office?

24:21.659 --> 24:23.620
This is my office, Denny.

24:23.655 --> 24:24.784
Oh…

24:24.785 --> 24:27.058
That must mean I've come to see you.

24:27.093 --> 24:28.862
Why?

24:29.027 --> 24:30.029
I don't know.

24:30.064 --> 24:33.544
It could be to say we were right
to mock the proceedings.

24:33.579 --> 24:37.025
A child was saved.  That's what
you say in your closing.

24:37.060 --> 24:39.135
–It isn't.
–Yes, it is.

24:39.170 --> 24:41.474
That's the button for your closing.

24:41.509 --> 24:44.301
It's that simple.

24:45.796 --> 24:49.516
It's not polite to talk about
crazy people behind their backs.

24:56.998 --> 24:59.855
I accept that I have debt and that
I should pay it.

24:59.855 --> 25:02.677
But to suddenly up it from ten
to fifty thousand?  I…

25:02.677 --> 25:04.148
Melissa…

25:04.183 --> 25:07.211
You know in the short time
that we've spent together,

25:07.211 --> 25:10.169
I can appreciate that
you are an honorable person.

25:10.169 --> 25:13.136
And one that lives up to her obligation.
Am I right about that?

25:13.136 --> 25:13.871
Yes.

25:13.906 --> 25:16.542
Well, you did apply
for the Prominence bank card

25:16.542 --> 25:18.965
and entered into a contract
accepting its terms.

25:18.965 --> 25:21.354
–I'm right about that too, aren't I?
–Yes.

25:21.354 --> 25:22.683
And you then went out

25:22.718 --> 25:26.051
and made voluntary purchases
pursuant to the terms of that contract.

25:26.051 --> 25:27.853
These sound like trial questions.

25:27.853 --> 25:29.585
Oh, I assure you they are not.

25:29.585 --> 25:32.188
No. See. Here's the thing about me.

25:32.223 --> 25:36.807
I like to take the adversary out
of adversary system, okay?

25:36.842 --> 25:38.542
I'm just trying to get the full picture here

25:38.542 --> 25:41.308
so that I can better understand where
you're coming from.

25:41.308 --> 25:45.180
And so you can better understand me.

25:45.541 --> 25:48.530
You seem swell.

25:54.373 --> 25:58.189
Of course, we're all happy that
Tito Perez was rescued safely.

25:58.224 --> 26:01.522
But the ends cannot justify the means.

26:01.557 --> 26:04.785
Not when the means involve kidnapping,

26:04.820 --> 26:10.825
FBI impersonation, false imprisonment,
chopped off fingers, extortion and assault.

26:10.860 --> 26:15.685
And whether he intended to severe
the fingers of Father Ryan or not…

26:15.686 --> 26:21.962
he clearly and intentionally swung
that axe with reckless disregard.

26:21.997 --> 26:24.452
We are a nation of laws.

26:24.487 --> 26:29.070
We are also a country that stands
for civil liberties and human rights.

26:29.105 --> 26:33.012
These are principals embedded in our constitution.

26:33.047 --> 26:35.155
Our Bill of Rights.

26:35.190 --> 26:38.928
This man not only broke the law.

26:38.963 --> 26:44.413
He obliterated fundamental
constitutional tenants in the process.

26:44.448 --> 26:48.352
Vigilante justice may be acceptable in
other lands.

26:48.387 --> 26:50.981
It is not so here.

26:51.016 --> 26:54.532
–This is…
–Here it comes.

26:54.567 --> 26:58.048
the United States of America.

27:07.919 --> 27:11.426
Don't even think about it.

27:17.753 --> 27:21.444
We keep hearing about the rights
of the accused in this country.

27:21.444 --> 27:23.588
What about the victims?

27:23.623 --> 27:26.804
What about his rights?
We're supposed to say,

27:26.839 --> 27:31.483
“Sorry, Tito, we'd love to save you,
but there are these rules?”

27:31.518 --> 27:34.735
There's a murder in this country
every thirty-one minutes,

27:34.735 --> 27:37.882
a forcible rape every six minutes,
a robbery every one minute.

27:37.882 --> 27:42.442
But, “Hey! let's all band together
and protect the constitutional principals

27:42.457 --> 27:45.394
that make this country great”.

27:45.429 --> 27:48.331
Things clearly got ugly here.

27:48.645 --> 27:51.859
But a human life was at stake.

27:51.894 --> 27:55.873
With all due respect to the civil
liberties of the suspect's brother,

27:55.873 --> 27:58.535
with great deference to Canon law

27:58.570 --> 28:03.247
and Father Ryan's Italian
imported door and his fingers,

28:03.282 --> 28:07.925
the life of a four year old boy
was at stake.

28:08.612 --> 28:14.591
Brad Chase saved that little boy's life.

28:26.927 --> 28:30.235
It's that simple.

28:54.161 --> 28:56.081
You're not giving me anything here?

28:56.081 --> 28:59.707
First of all, if I were to forgive
your obligations, believe it or not,

28:59.707 --> 29:00.964
I'd be hurting you.

29:00.999 --> 29:02.105
Hurting me?

29:02.140 --> 29:03.331
Okay, this is me.

29:03.366 --> 29:06.952
The way I raise my own kids.
It's not what you give them.

29:06.987 --> 29:10.167
It's how you teach them
to get things for themselves.

29:19.589 --> 29:22.242
Just making sure you're real.

29:22.821 --> 29:25.281
You know, I don't know you yet, Mr Shore.

29:25.286 --> 29:27.682
But I get this feeling
I'm gonna like you.

29:27.682 --> 29:31.790
May I ask?  You spoke of honoring
obligations as if it's a good thing?

29:31.790 --> 29:32.712
Indeed I did.

29:32.747 --> 29:35.496
Then why do you
and other credit card companies

29:35.496 --> 29:41.330
refer to the customers who pay off
their debts promptly as deadbeats?

29:41.365 --> 29:43.501
Well, that's not a term
I would personally use.

29:43.501 --> 29:45.608
No. Because you're swell.

29:45.643 --> 29:50.027
But your company uses the term like a mantra.

29:50.062 --> 29:51.509
Here's the thing.

29:51.544 --> 29:56.137
Let me tell you a little about me and why
I chose to represent Prominence Bank.

29:56.137 --> 30:00.793
Like any other credit card service,
it's a business, sure.

30:00.828 --> 30:02.342
But it is a service.

30:02.377 --> 30:04.773
We help people who are short of cash.

30:04.808 --> 30:08.604
Help them make their rent so they don't
get thrown out on the street.

30:08.604 --> 30:11.553
Help them make a car payment
so they can get to work.

30:11.553 --> 30:17.433
Help them buy Christmas presents
for their children during tough times.

30:17.468 --> 30:20.092
You're like Santa Claus.

30:20.127 --> 30:23.650
I can see you and I need to go out
and shoot some ducks together.

30:23.650 --> 30:26.593
Do you explain all the credit terms
to your customers?

30:26.593 --> 30:30.068
Well, they're on the back
of every application.

30:30.103 --> 30:31.740
Like this? With the tiny print?

30:31.740 --> 30:34.422
I have JD and an MBA from Harvard and

30:34.457 --> 30:38.455
even I can't make heads nor tails
of this deception and fraud.

30:38.490 --> 30:42.308
It's deception and fraud!

30:46.717 --> 30:49.318
Well, look who found his tongue!

30:49.353 --> 30:50.809
And you, Mr Shore.

30:50.844 --> 30:52.280
You're a hoot. That's what.

30:52.280 --> 30:57.895
Is it true your company actually targets
people with bad credit ratings?

30:57.930 --> 31:01.319
Well, we have an extremely
complex marketing strategy,

31:01.354 --> 31:04.367
one that I'd be happy to take
some time and explain to you.

31:04.367 --> 31:05.581
That's okay.

31:05.616 --> 31:07.050
I think I've got it.

31:07.085 --> 31:10.573
You find people in dire straits
and market directly to them

31:10.573 --> 31:13.951
with the hope of forming a lifelong relationship.

31:13.986 --> 31:18.195
I had a former client who kind of
operated his business the same way.

31:18.230 --> 31:20.502
Really? What line of work was he in?

31:20.537 --> 31:23.005
He sold heroin.

31:23.995 --> 31:27.879
My friend, I'm not a man
who offends easily.

31:27.914 --> 31:31.397
So I could call you a loan shark
and you'd be fine.

31:31.432 --> 31:35.427
When you charge your customers 30
percent interest, you're a loan shark.

31:35.427 --> 31:38.641
That term implies criminal conduct.

31:38.676 --> 31:40.541
It's not criminal,

31:40.576 --> 31:45.468
because your parasitic lobbyists have
penetrated both aisles of Congress.

31:45.503 --> 31:50.444
The credit card industry is more profitable
than McDonalds, Microsoft and Walmart.

31:50.479 --> 31:55.845
You've got yourself a multi-billion
dollar racket going, Mr Palmer.

31:57.440 --> 32:03.525
Given that we are bigger than Walmart
or McDonalds or Microsoft,

32:03.560 --> 32:05.672
we enjoy some security.

32:05.707 --> 32:08.020
And potential lawsuits like this?

32:08.055 --> 32:11.569
We have an expression in Texas, Mr Shore.

32:11.604 --> 32:16.369
You're all hat, and no cattle.

32:22.065 --> 32:24.469
Here's the thing about me.

32:24.504 --> 32:26.093
I am a hoot.

32:26.128 --> 32:30.322
But I insist on putting adversary
back into the system.

32:30.357 --> 32:34.523
And I do it openly and notoriously
for all to hear.

32:34.558 --> 32:37.973
While a swell guy like you
doesn't want the public to know

32:37.973 --> 32:42.364
that of the thousands of industries
tracked by the Better Business Bureau,

32:42.364 --> 32:46.374
the credit card racket is number one
in customer complaints.

32:46.409 --> 32:50.385
You don't want them to know that
you deliberately target

32:50.420 --> 32:52.573
those who won't be able
to pay off their debts.

32:52.573 --> 32:54.821
People you call, revolvers.

32:54.856 --> 32:58.193
People who see, zero percent interest
in big blue print,

32:58.193 --> 33:01.375
and don't know that with
just one late payment,

33:01.410 --> 33:03.903
you skyrocket their interest
to 30 percent.

33:03.903 --> 33:08.403
That if they so much as inquire about
leasing a car, you raise their rates.

33:08.424 --> 33:12.875
You don't want the public to know
that while over seven million families

33:12.910 --> 33:15.623
have filed for bankruptcy
in the last five years,

33:15.623 --> 33:18.267
you got Congress to change
the bankruptcy code

33:18.267 --> 33:22.036
to make it next to impossible for people
to discharge credit card debt.

33:22.036 --> 33:25.756
You don't want people to know that
the credit card industry is

33:25.788 --> 33:31.795
essentially a pack of hyenas crunching
on the bones of the poor, do you?

33:31.830 --> 33:34.933
I smell something awful.

33:35.504 --> 33:36.721
I think it's you.

33:36.756 --> 33:42.707
Yes, this case has the stench of
big tobacco and asbestos all over it.

33:42.742 --> 33:48.659
Luckily our firm has nine offices around
the US, London and Hong Kong,

33:48.694 --> 33:53.293
strategically positioned for
massive class action suits.

33:53.328 --> 33:55.726
And once the company you represent
smells it, too.

33:55.726 --> 33:58.576
They'll find you're not nearly smart
or powerful enough

33:58.576 --> 34:03.598
and they'll drop you for a firm that
employs expertise and intimidation

34:03.633 --> 34:07.519
rather than down home
hokum and smiley handshakes.

34:07.554 --> 34:08.963
And this is my favorite part,

34:08.963 --> 34:14.018
when your firm fires your obsequiese ass
for losing their client, oh, my God!

34:14.054 --> 34:18.184
The stress!  Your tan will fade,
you'll gain a few pounds,

34:18.219 --> 34:20.723
drink a bit more, scream at the kids,

34:20.757 --> 34:23.250
and maybe your wife will finally leave you.

34:23.250 --> 34:25.179
For the realtor who sells your house

34:25.179 --> 34:28.800
because after all he'll still be able
to afford Christmas in Aruba

34:28.800 --> 34:32.168
and next year's convertible.

34:34.027 --> 34:37.962
Hey, fella. Don't worry about it.

34:37.996 --> 34:41.005
It'll be a hoot.

34:58.367 --> 35:00.152
You okay?

35:01.536 --> 35:02.897
Brad!

35:03.250 --> 35:05.707
–Jury's back.
–Already?

35:07.477 --> 35:09.218
Let's go.

35:15.224 --> 35:17.106
Mr Shore…

35:17.141 --> 35:19.326
May I borrow a moment of your time?

35:19.361 --> 35:21.389
At 30 percent interest.

35:21.424 --> 35:23.382
You know what you are?

35:23.417 --> 35:26.000
You're a pistol, that's what.

35:26.159 --> 35:29.717
Listen.  I've thought a lot of many
of the issues you raised.

35:29.717 --> 35:32.918
And, well, you touched me.

35:32.953 --> 35:33.761
Did I?

35:33.796 --> 35:36.475
It was certainly never our intent
to victimize Melissa.

35:36.475 --> 35:39.804
Or anybody for that matter
in her financial constraints.

35:39.804 --> 35:42.273
–No?
–I talked to my clients.

35:42.308 --> 35:44.743
Relayed to them that, well…

35:44.778 --> 35:46.544
You were touched.

35:46.579 --> 35:50.325
We've decided to forgive
all debts and loans to Melissa.

35:50.360 --> 35:52.395
Just wipe it clean. How about that?

35:52.395 --> 35:54.326
–Now I'm touched.
–Of course…

35:54.361 --> 35:56.858
my people are concerned about precedent.

35:56.893 --> 35:59.321
And others demanding similar amnesty so…

35:59.356 --> 36:03.193
the offer would have to be
conditioned on confidentiality.

36:03.228 --> 36:07.303
Well, may I say as a personal aside,

36:07.338 --> 36:10.838
it has been a real pleasure
meeting both you and Melissa.

36:10.873 --> 36:14.338
I wish you continued health
and happiness in the future.

36:14.373 --> 36:18.349
You know we have a little saying
in Massachusetts.

36:18.384 --> 36:22.326
Maybe someday you'll get
horribly sick and die.

36:22.499 --> 36:24.065
Until then!

36:27.063 --> 36:29.089
You…

36:29.124 --> 36:31.115
You dog.

36:41.608 --> 36:44.268
Mr Foreman, have you reached a verdict?

36:44.303 --> 36:46.929
–We have, your honor.
–What say you?

36:47.111 --> 36:52.802
On the charge of kidnapping we find
the defendant, Bradley Chase…

36:52.837 --> 36:54.917
not guilty.

36:54.952 --> 36:59.188
On the charge of false imprisonment
we find the defendant, Bradley Chase…

36:59.188 --> 37:00.598
not guilty.

37:00.633 --> 37:07.128
On the charge of aggravated assault,
we find the defendant, Bradley Chase…

37:07.163 --> 37:08.922
not guilty.

37:08.957 --> 37:10.320
The jury is dismissed.

37:10.355 --> 37:12.925
The court thanks you for your service.

37:12.960 --> 37:15.208
Mr Chase, you are free to go.

37:15.243 --> 37:20.593
Though personally I find your behavior
to be shocking and outrageous!

37:20.628 --> 37:22.827
We are adjourned.

37:26.352 --> 37:27.670
Thank you.

37:27.705 --> 37:29.826
You got lucky, Brad. You do know that.

37:29.826 --> 37:31.776
I know.

37:32.565 --> 37:34.055
Denny?

37:34.566 --> 37:36.723
Thanks.

37:41.505 --> 37:43.666
Thank you.

37:57.942 --> 37:59.644
First of all, I just wanna say thank you.

37:59.644 --> 38:03.601
Which, of course, goes totally without
saying, but I'm saying it anyway.

38:03.601 --> 38:06.627
Second, I will work here for free to pay
off my legal fees if you want me to.

38:06.627 --> 38:08.470
I don't.

38:08.505 --> 38:12.950
Third, and this is not a come-on,
it is just a statement of fact.

38:12.985 --> 38:17.592
When you rattled off that whole, you
don't want the public to know, laundry list…

38:17.592 --> 38:20.610
That was the single sexiest thing I have
ever seen a man do.

38:20.610 --> 38:23.956
You should see me when I do it naked.

38:24.139 --> 38:28.116
I'm just gonna go, um, change my…

38:28.151 --> 38:31.251
screensaver.

38:49.263 --> 38:51.375
We won our case. Did you hear?

38:51.410 --> 38:52.903
I did.

38:54.164 --> 38:57.483
Brad must be relieved.

38:57.729 --> 39:00.306
How'd your case with Hands go?

39:00.341 --> 39:02.798
Well.

39:03.688 --> 39:07.812
Can I ask you something,
friend to friend?

39:07.986 --> 39:10.022
Of course.

39:11.075 --> 39:14.559
Shirley made this comment,

39:14.594 --> 39:18.043
“Don't make it about me”.

39:18.078 --> 39:20.067
Do I do that?

39:20.102 --> 39:23.183
–Get outta town.
–Seriously.

39:23.218 --> 39:27.091
Do I act like I'm
the only one in the room?

39:27.126 --> 39:30.706
Denny, one of the things I love
about you is when we talk.

39:30.741 --> 39:34.503
Often it's as if you're not
even in the room.

39:34.538 --> 39:36.249
Promise?

39:39.062 --> 39:40.815
I was brilliant by the way.

39:40.850 --> 39:43.329
I wish you've been there.

39:43.364 --> 39:45.808
I wish I had as well, Denny.

39:45.955 --> 39:47.084
I must tell you though,

39:47.084 --> 39:50.957
it's not that I don't appreciate
the value of fascistic problem solving,

39:50.957 --> 39:53.477
but given Brad and the FBI's tactics here,

39:53.502 --> 39:58.071
if I had been the prosecutor,
Brad'd be in prison tonight.

39:58.106 --> 40:00.882
And if I'd represented the pedophile,

40:00.917 --> 40:03.363
I'd be getting him out.

40:03.398 --> 40:05.855
I'd have shot him.

40:06.126 --> 40:08.351
Right.

40:08.704 --> 40:11.561
Think we'll ever see the day
when the defense lawyer…

40:11.561 --> 40:14.654
will be legally permitted
to shoot the defendant?

40:14.689 --> 40:18.025
We seem to be making progress.

40:18.198 --> 40:19.439
Denny Crane.

40:19.474 --> 40:21.801
I'll be your attorney.

40:22.305 --> 40:28.802
