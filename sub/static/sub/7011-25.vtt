WEBVTT

00:05.772 --> 00:08.172
Hey, whatcha doin'?

00:08.241 --> 00:10.209
Just countin'
my secret stash.

00:10.276 --> 00:13.404
- I'm gettin' something special for Donna.
- Something special, huh?

00:13.480 --> 00:15.778
Oh, is it firecrackers?

00:15.849 --> 00:17.407
No.

00:17.484 --> 00:20.647
No, no, 'cause if it's somethin'
that blows up, I'll go halfsies.

00:25.058 --> 00:27.424
It's a promise ring.

00:27.527 --> 00:30.553
'Cause, you know, Donna and I
have been fighting a lot lately.

00:30.630 --> 00:32.598
Forman, you get
mushy with Donna...

00:32.665 --> 00:35.498
she's gonna see
the secret girl inside the man.

00:37.837 --> 00:41.034
Now, trust me, you don't
want to let Erica out.

00:42.475 --> 00:45.171
Erica.

00:45.245 --> 00:47.509
That's a good burn.

00:47.580 --> 00:50.947
You can't do that
with Michael. I'm lucky.

00:51.017 --> 00:53.281
Oh, really, Michelle?

00:55.088 --> 00:57.022
Oh, I forgot
about Michelle.

00:58.525 --> 01:02.017
Look, Hyde obviously doesn't
understand mature relationships...

01:02.095 --> 01:04.063
but I do.

01:04.129 --> 01:06.963
And a promise ring is not only
a gift from the heart...

01:07.033 --> 01:10.127
but it also means more sex
and less mouthing off.

01:11.738 --> 01:13.865
I'm gettin' one for Jackie too!

01:13.940 --> 01:15.703
Great.
Let's go.

01:15.775 --> 01:18.437
All right.
See you later, Hyde-a...

01:18.511 --> 01:20.445
alicia.

01:21.781 --> 01:24.181
What's a good
girlie name for Hyde?

01:24.250 --> 01:27.242
Uh, Hyde...

01:27.320 --> 01:29.550
drangea?

01:29.622 --> 01:31.647
It's Heidi,
you morons! Heidi!

01:35.462 --> 01:38.920
Okay, is it me, or is this not a ring store?

01:41.301 --> 01:44.998
Will you trust me?
I know a guy who knows a guy.

01:45.071 --> 01:47.005
He'll be here any minute.

01:50.910 --> 01:53.105
Hey, dudes.

01:55.115 --> 01:57.345
Leo's the guy?

01:57.417 --> 01:59.612
Kelso, I thought you knew
a guy who knew a guy.

01:59.686 --> 02:01.711
Yeah, I do.

02:03.289 --> 02:05.314
But I know Leo.

02:06.759 --> 02:09.158
Fine, so you're the guy!

02:12.265 --> 02:15.291
So, Leo,
you sell promise rings?

02:15.368 --> 02:18.337
Promise rings,
concert T's...

02:18.404 --> 02:20.338
other stuff.

02:25.145 --> 02:27.136
- Really?
- That's nice.

02:27.213 --> 02:29.147
Yeah.

02:30.884 --> 02:32.818
Okay, we'll take
two rings and...

02:32.886 --> 02:35.150
a misdemeanor's worth
of the other stuff.

02:37.000 --> 02:43.074

03:13.126 --> 03:16.391
Ah, the ring of love.

03:16.462 --> 03:19.727
Just holding it makes me feel
mellow and content.

03:21.467 --> 03:23.458
Actually, that might
not be the ring.

03:25.138 --> 03:28.301
Why is everybody
but Fez in love?

03:28.374 --> 03:31.639
If I don't get some romance soon,
I'm going to give myself a blister.

03:32.879 --> 03:35.712
Well, another blister.

03:37.283 --> 03:39.274
Tell you what, Fez.
I'm going to take you...

03:39.352 --> 03:41.377
cruising for chicks
in the El Camino.

03:41.454 --> 03:44.355
And I'm gonna let
you buy the gas...

03:44.424 --> 03:46.858
and buy my dinner.

03:46.926 --> 03:49.258
And if we meet a chick...

03:49.329 --> 03:51.263
I'm gonna let you walk home.

03:53.900 --> 03:58.166
Guys, what if Jackie doesn't want
a ring from a guy like me?

03:58.238 --> 04:01.799
I mean, sure, I'm good lookin',
but I can't be trusted.

04:03.276 --> 04:05.210
No, you guys are
the perfect couple.

04:05.278 --> 04:07.678
You do the bad stuff,
and she tries to catch you.

04:07.747 --> 04:10.682
She's... Smokey to your Bandit.

04:11.985 --> 04:14.715
God, it's like that movie
applies to everything!

04:16.255 --> 04:19.817
I just... I wish there was a way
I could give Jackie a thing...

04:19.892 --> 04:21.860
that wasn't actually
the ring.

04:21.928 --> 04:25.762
You know, like a... a test gift
just to see what she would say.

04:25.832 --> 04:28.926
And then if it went bad,
I could just walk away.

04:30.103 --> 04:32.469
Hey, am I talking in rhyme?

04:32.538 --> 04:34.733
I wish I could do that
all the time.

04:35.975 --> 04:38.341
Oh! Oh, man!

04:41.447 --> 04:45.178
That was fun, huh?
It was a good movie.

04:45.251 --> 04:48.584
It was one of those love movies
like you like, huh?

04:50.423 --> 04:52.755
And who took ya?

04:52.825 --> 04:55.055
This guy.

04:58.831 --> 05:02.232
- Yeah, it was great.
- You know what else this guy did for ya?

05:03.336 --> 05:05.736
Got you a present.

05:09.776 --> 05:12.472
"To Donna.
Love, This Guy."

05:14.447 --> 05:16.642
Yeah.
That's me.

05:18.951 --> 05:21.317
Oh, my God!

05:21.387 --> 05:23.480
It's a promise ring.

05:23.556 --> 05:25.922
Eric, it's...
it's beautiful.

05:26.959 --> 05:30.451
I'm so glad you like it.
'Cause look...

05:30.530 --> 05:33.556
- even though things have been a little weird lately...
- <i>Oh!</i>

05:33.633 --> 05:35.794
Look how cute
on the car!

05:40.306 --> 05:42.331
Here, look what
Eric got me!

05:42.408 --> 05:45.571
Oh, my!
Red, go get the camera.

05:45.645 --> 05:47.670
- Kitty...
- Mom, I...

05:47.747 --> 05:50.875
Go! It's in the drawer
near the cheese grater.

05:52.118 --> 05:54.052
Mom... No.

05:54.120 --> 05:56.918
Hush.
Donna, now...

05:56.989 --> 05:59.480
make the face you made
when Eric gave you the ring.

06:01.260 --> 06:03.854
Oh, now, see, I don't think
you rolled your eyes!

06:07.800 --> 06:09.791
Kitty...

06:11.337 --> 06:13.532
I cut myself on
the cheese grater.

06:16.743 --> 06:19.871
Oh, now you get back here
and smile, damn it!

06:25.785 --> 06:28.049
Can you believe it?

06:28.121 --> 06:30.055
- Isn't it pretty?
- Yeah.

06:30.123 --> 06:33.718
I really need to introduce you
to my good friend nail polish.

06:38.731 --> 06:40.665
And a promise ring
is sacred, Donna.

06:40.733 --> 06:43.964
- Why aren't you wearing it on your left ring finger?
- I don't know.

06:44.036 --> 06:46.527
'Cause I like it on this finger.
What's the difference?

06:46.606 --> 06:50.838
<i>Donna, if you don't wear your</i>
<i>promise ring on your left ring finger...</i>

06:50.910 --> 06:53.936
it totally cancels out the promise
that you will be together forever.

06:54.013 --> 06:56.481
Wait. That's what
I promised?

07:00.119 --> 07:02.178
Hey, ladies.

07:02.255 --> 07:04.723
Oh, nice ring, Donna.

07:04.791 --> 07:06.952
Jackie, let me see yours.

07:09.929 --> 07:13.092
- I don't have one.
- Oh, no, of course not.

07:15.668 --> 07:18.296
Because Kelso has not
given you one yet.

07:18.371 --> 07:20.703
I mean, ever.
I mean...

07:24.844 --> 07:26.812
Look away.

07:30.483 --> 07:34.180
Donna, did you hear that?
Michael's giving me a promise ring.

07:34.253 --> 07:37.780
- Yeah, that's great.
- I wonder how he's gonna give it to me.

07:37.857 --> 07:39.984
I hope he hides it in food.

07:41.327 --> 07:43.795
I told him if he ever
gives me something nice...

07:43.863 --> 07:46.525
he should put it
in food.

07:46.599 --> 07:48.533
It's classy.

07:54.240 --> 07:56.174
All right, man, be cool.

07:57.610 --> 07:59.771
These chicks
are checking us out.

08:01.147 --> 08:03.581
Cool, gotcha.

08:06.052 --> 08:08.612
Hello, ladies!

08:12.124 --> 08:14.319
No, man, that's not
how you do it.

08:14.393 --> 08:16.224
You gotta be aloof.

08:18.364 --> 08:20.628
Did you just
call me a "loof"?

08:26.706 --> 08:29.800
Because if so,
I'll have to kick you in your 'nads.

08:33.846 --> 08:35.780
No, man.
Aloof.

08:35.847 --> 08:37.816
Distant.

08:37.884 --> 08:39.818
Zen.

08:39.885 --> 08:43.150
Well, that's not what
loof means in my language.

08:46.058 --> 08:49.152
Look, I don't care what you think it means,
that's what it means here.

08:52.865 --> 08:55.163
You're the loof.

08:56.736 --> 08:58.761
- Fez, it's not...
- I said loof!

09:01.474 --> 09:04.705
Hey, sweetie.
I got you something.

09:04.777 --> 09:06.802
It's a gift.

09:06.879 --> 09:09.712
A token of my love.

09:10.716 --> 09:13.480
- Do you accept it?
- A sundae?

09:16.088 --> 09:18.022
Oh.

09:19.191 --> 09:21.091
Yeah.

09:23.396 --> 09:25.660
Mmm! Michael,
this is good.

09:31.337 --> 09:33.271
Uh...

09:33.339 --> 09:36.172
You could, uh...

09:36.242 --> 09:39.473
Uh, y-you could close your mouth
if you... if you wanted.

09:39.545 --> 09:41.843
What the hell,
Michael?

09:41.914 --> 09:44.747
This is ice cream.
Stupid ice cream?

09:44.817 --> 09:47.786
No, it's stupid
ice cream of love.

09:57.296 --> 09:59.730
Oh, there you are.

09:59.799 --> 10:02.927
The movie's about to start.
Come on. We're...

10:03.002 --> 10:06.836
- Where's your ring?
- Oh, I put it on a chain so I could wear it around my neck.

10:08.374 --> 10:10.308
Burn!

10:12.378 --> 10:15.836
Oh, super burn.
The wedding's off!

10:17.283 --> 10:19.478
Kelso, shut up!

10:19.552 --> 10:22.180
Yeah, Michael, you don't know
anything about anything.

10:24.490 --> 10:27.459
I do too!

10:29.061 --> 10:32.292
Now I don't know
which fight's the funniest.

10:34.500 --> 10:36.468
Wait, fight?
We're...

10:37.670 --> 10:39.638
Okay, I'll be right back.

10:45.144 --> 10:48.238
Donna, why aren't you wearing
the ring... on your hand?

10:48.314 --> 10:50.578
I don't know. I didn't think
it was a big deal.

10:50.650 --> 10:54.313
That is not true! I told you.
I told her it was a big deal.

10:55.888 --> 10:58.618
Look, Eric, why don't we
talk about this later?

10:58.691 --> 11:01.353
Well, I... You know, there's not really
anything to talk about.

11:01.427 --> 11:03.361
Unless... you don't
wanna wear the ring.

11:03.429 --> 11:05.363
Ouch!

11:08.668 --> 11:11.296
Sorry.
I'm sorry.

11:16.275 --> 11:18.539
It's great.
The ring is great.

11:18.611 --> 11:21.136
See?

11:21.213 --> 11:24.205
- It's great.
- So we're good?

11:24.283 --> 11:26.843
Yeah, fine.

11:26.919 --> 11:28.819
Okay, good.

11:34.160 --> 11:37.095
It's my God-given
right as a mother!

11:47.874 --> 11:50.775
Oh, Mrs. Forman,
that is a wonderful picture.

11:52.546 --> 11:55.310
You can really see
how unhappy Donna is.

11:57.417 --> 11:59.351
Okay, all I know is...

11:59.419 --> 12:02.582
when Donna said she was fine,
she didn't seem that fine.

12:02.656 --> 12:06.615
Eric has never been good at knowing
when fine isn't fine.

12:08.328 --> 12:10.489
It runs
in the family.

12:13.567 --> 12:16.400
Oh, it does not.

12:16.469 --> 12:19.404
- Fine.
- Okay, good.

12:22.776 --> 12:25.040
I don't know.
She doesn't look that unhappy.

12:25.111 --> 12:27.443
She kinda
looks like you.

12:27.514 --> 12:30.244
I'm unhappy, Bob.

12:47.100 --> 12:49.500
I'm just so worried
about Eric and Donna.

12:53.940 --> 12:55.874
Ah, fine.

13:01.414 --> 13:03.746
<i>Welcome to</i> Let's Make A Deal!

13:07.954 --> 13:09.888
All right, Donna,
which is it going to be...

13:09.956 --> 13:12.447
your future behind door number one,
door number two...

13:12.525 --> 13:14.459
or door number three?

13:14.527 --> 13:17.121
Oh, my God!
I don't know! Um...

13:19.366 --> 13:21.459
- Okay.
- Yeah?

13:21.534 --> 13:23.798
- Door number three.
- Door number three.

13:23.870 --> 13:27.636
All right, let's take a look at what you
didn't choose behind door number one!

13:29.509 --> 13:31.943
<i>It's a leather jacket</i>
<i>and a typewriter...</i>

13:32.012 --> 13:34.139
<i>which you could have</i>
<i>used when you became...</i>

13:34.214 --> 13:36.910
a globe-trotting
rock-and-roll journalist.

13:38.051 --> 13:40.679
Wow, that
would've been nice.

13:40.754 --> 13:42.745
Yeah, too bad.

13:44.891 --> 13:48.258
All right, let's take a look
at what was behind door number two.

13:50.030 --> 13:52.430
<i>The U.S. Constitution,</i>
<i>which would come in handy...</i>

13:52.499 --> 13:55.400
when you became
the first woman president!

13:55.468 --> 13:58.835
Oh, Monty,
these prizes are bitchin'!

13:58.905 --> 14:00.873
Yeah, truly bitchin'.

14:02.542 --> 14:06.342
Now let's take a look at what
you did choose behind door number three.

14:11.551 --> 14:14.076
<i>It's your boyfriend</i>
<i>and a promise ring!</i>

14:15.355 --> 14:17.550
I love you!

14:28.301 --> 14:30.235
Hyde, when I cruise a girl...

14:30.303 --> 14:33.568
how long do I have to talk to her
before she will French me?

14:36.109 --> 14:39.510
That depends on what kind of girl
you're cruising for.

14:39.579 --> 14:41.570
Which is why
I'm gonna aim low.

14:43.883 --> 14:46.249
Real low.

14:46.319 --> 14:48.446
Just this side of gross.

14:52.625 --> 14:55.287
Where is Michael Kelso?
I want my ring!

14:55.361 --> 14:57.295
He's in the toilet.

14:57.363 --> 14:59.854
Jackie, wait, wait.

14:59.933 --> 15:03.061
Kelso wants to
give you the ring...

15:03.136 --> 15:05.434
- but he's scared.
- Why is he scared?

15:05.505 --> 15:07.473
Because you're scary.

15:10.643 --> 15:15.012
No, because Kelso
is delicate, sensitive.

15:15.081 --> 15:18.175
Girlish even.

15:18.251 --> 15:22.085
You cannot push him into this. You gotta
be gentle. He'll do it when he's ready.

15:23.757 --> 15:26.453
Where's my ring,
you idiot?

15:28.161 --> 15:31.255
Or yell at him.
It's more fun for us.

15:31.331 --> 15:35.768
Look, you, I want my promise ring,
and I want it now.

15:35.835 --> 15:37.826
Give it.

15:39.405 --> 15:41.669
Really?
Okay, just wait.

15:41.741 --> 15:43.902
'Cause I... I just...
I wanna do this right.

15:49.249 --> 15:51.979
Jackie...

15:52.051 --> 15:55.077
from the first minute
that I saw you...

15:55.155 --> 15:57.487
I knew that I wanted to
fool around with you.

16:04.230 --> 16:07.028
And then,
after we did that...

16:08.101 --> 16:10.296
and I still wanted
to talk to you?

16:12.372 --> 16:15.000
I knew that I never wanted
to be without you.

16:16.509 --> 16:18.443
So...

16:19.512 --> 16:21.446
will you accept my ring?

16:22.515 --> 16:25.040
Yeah. Yeah,
Michael, I will.

16:28.221 --> 16:30.883
Oh, God.

16:30.957 --> 16:33.187
I know.

16:39.132 --> 16:41.066
Hey, what's up?

16:41.134 --> 16:44.729
- So, how was cruising?
- Unsettling.

16:46.272 --> 16:49.901
When a girl is in a car,
you can only see her from the neck up.

16:54.981 --> 16:57.779
Talk about the tip
of the iceberg! Oh.

17:01.120 --> 17:03.850
- So where's Donna?
- Ah, she said she had to study.

17:03.923 --> 17:06.448
Oh. So everything's cool?

17:07.794 --> 17:09.728
Okay...

17:10.730 --> 17:12.721
Look...

17:12.799 --> 17:14.993
I don't know what everyone
thinks is going on...

17:15.068 --> 17:18.435
but Donna and I
are not only fine...

17:18.503 --> 17:20.438
we're great.

17:20.506 --> 17:22.872
Everything's
finally settled, so...

17:22.942 --> 17:25.205
we're happier than ever.

17:25.278 --> 17:28.247
Well, one of you is.

17:28.314 --> 17:31.511
- What is that supposed to mean?
- Look, Forman...

17:31.584 --> 17:33.518
I get what
you're trying to do.

17:33.586 --> 17:37.579
You know, you're trying
to lock her up, seal the deal.

17:37.657 --> 17:41.650
And... all I'm saying is...

17:41.728 --> 17:43.787
Maybe Donna's not
that kind of girl.

17:47.634 --> 17:51.070
Okay, you don't know
as much as you think, Hyde.

17:51.137 --> 17:53.230
So you need to just shut up.

17:59.679 --> 18:02.477
Now, that man is a loof.

18:12.825 --> 18:14.759
Hey! What are you
doing out here?

18:14.827 --> 18:17.819
Um... I wanted
to talk to you.

18:22.135 --> 18:25.332
Look, this is gonna be hard.

18:25.405 --> 18:27.396
Um...

18:29.776 --> 18:31.710
Eric, I love you.

18:31.778 --> 18:33.837
A lot.

18:33.913 --> 18:36.313
But I have to give you
your ring back.

18:36.382 --> 18:40.045
What? Why?

18:41.821 --> 18:43.812
Okay...

18:47.026 --> 18:49.187
How do you see
the next 20 years?

18:51.497 --> 18:54.125
I don't know.
I guess I always figured...

18:54.200 --> 18:57.465
we'd go to college together,
then come home...

18:57.537 --> 18:59.971
Yeah, but, Eric, you know
that's not what I want.

19:00.039 --> 19:02.234
I mean,
I've told you that.

19:02.308 --> 19:05.436
And who knows? I might want
to go to school back East.

19:05.511 --> 19:08.275
Or... maybe in Paris.

19:08.348 --> 19:12.910
Okay, well, you know what,
Donna, whatever. Okay?

19:12.986 --> 19:17.320
The important thing is when you
see yourself in Paris or wherever...

19:17.390 --> 19:19.381
I'm there, right?

19:21.828 --> 19:24.296
Right?

19:24.364 --> 19:26.764
I don't know.

19:27.900 --> 19:30.368
Not always.

19:30.436 --> 19:32.529
I mean, it's not like
there's anyone else...

19:32.605 --> 19:35.130
but sometimes
I'm by myself.

19:35.208 --> 19:39.269
I mean... All I mean is, I don't know.
Neither of us does.

19:39.345 --> 19:43.679
And this ring is just a stupid
high school promise.

19:43.750 --> 19:48.016
If we're meant to be together,
then... we'll end up together.

19:50.256 --> 19:52.281
No.

19:52.358 --> 19:55.794
The way we end up together
is by saying we'll be together...

19:55.862 --> 19:59.457
and then, being together.

19:59.532 --> 20:01.591
Eric, come on.

20:02.602 --> 20:04.627
We're together now.

20:04.704 --> 20:06.672
Isn't that enough?

20:06.739 --> 20:09.173
No!
I mean...

20:10.710 --> 20:12.644
I mean, damn, Donna.

20:12.712 --> 20:16.580
If you can see a future for yourself without
me and that doesn't, like, break your heart...

20:16.649 --> 20:19.243
then we're not doing what
I thought we were doing here.

20:19.318 --> 20:22.151
And you know what?
Maybe we shouldn't even be together at all!

20:22.221 --> 20:24.155
Wait a minute.

20:30.263 --> 20:32.197
Are you breaking up with me?

20:32.265 --> 20:34.233
Well...

20:34.300 --> 20:36.291
are you giving back
that ring?

20:39.138 --> 20:42.073
- Yes.
- <i>Then...</i>

20:44.777 --> 20:46.711
Yes.

21:38.531 --> 21:41.193
- Leo, I... I need to return this.
- Hey, man...

21:41.267 --> 21:44.998
I only said it was gold,
not real gold.

21:45.071 --> 21:47.562
No, it's...

21:47.640 --> 21:49.699
Donna and I broke up.

21:49.775 --> 21:51.709
What?

21:51.777 --> 21:54.109
What happened
to the love, man?

21:54.180 --> 21:56.478
Well, I don't really
feel like...

21:56.549 --> 22:00.781
No! If you kids
can't make it, who can?

22:00.853 --> 22:03.754
Tell me, who?

22:03.823 --> 22:06.257
Why, God, why?

22:07.305 --> 22:13.858
