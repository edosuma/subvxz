Ray, I don't feel like
going to your game.

Alex, I'd love just once
to come in here

01:22.880 --> 01:25.800
and not have to ask you
to clean up your room.

01:25.800 --> 01:27.600
You stay here until you do.

Sorry, Charlie.

Mom...

You're killing me, Al,
just killing me.

What?

02:58.840 --> 03:00.240
Ray, what's the matter?

03:00.240 --> 03:01.560
So you lost? So what?

03:01.560 --> 03:03.160
Can't you ever help me?

03:03.160 --> 03:04.880
Another foot
and that ball

03:04.880 --> 03:06.920
would have been
over the fence.

03:06.920 --> 03:09.000
You lift it out
and I'm a hero.

03:09.000 --> 03:10.040
So that's it?

03:10.040 --> 03:12.360
You want me
to cheat for you?

03:12.360 --> 03:14.400
You used your powers
to clean the room.

03:14.400 --> 03:15.520
That's different.

03:15.520 --> 03:17.080
You got this
all wrong.

03:17.080 --> 03:20.840
Ray, I can't use my powers
to fix a softball game.

03:20.840 --> 03:21.960
It isn't right.

03:21.960 --> 03:23.400
Just once in a while.

03:23.400 --> 03:24.400
I'd do it for you.

Ray, look out for the...

Wow, you really
hit your head hard.

03:38.520 --> 03:41.640
Did you... did you
put that pole there?

03:41.640 --> 03:44.160
It's Vince!
Let's get out of here!

Come on!

Hurry up, Alex!

Wow! This is great!

I'm glowing.

05:45.280 --> 05:46.400
[Annie]
What happened?

05:46.400 --> 05:48.000
Well, Vince
was chasing us

05:48.000 --> 05:50.240
and just as he was
about to grab me

05:50.240 --> 05:51.680
lightning struck

05:51.680 --> 05:53.520
all three of us.

05:54.960 --> 05:56.040
Alex...

05:56.040 --> 05:58.120
Float that cup
to yourself.

06:02.840 --> 06:04.320
I can't.

06:14.120 --> 06:16.000
Yes! Yes!

06:16.000 --> 06:17.360
Yes!

06:27.040 --> 06:28.360
Yes!

06:28.360 --> 06:30.000
Hey, Alex,
how do you morph?

06:30.000 --> 06:31.280
Tell me.

06:31.280 --> 06:33.000
I, I just think
about water

06:33.000 --> 06:35.000
and the next thing
I know...

06:36.000 --> 06:37.600
Oh, wow.

06:41.800 --> 06:43.440
I don't believe this.

06:43.440 --> 06:46.840
[Ray] This is cool.
How do I come back?

06:46.840 --> 06:49.240
Just think about
your normal self.

06:53.240 --> 06:54.160
Wow...

06:54.160 --> 06:56.080
I got the powers!

06:56.080 --> 07:00.120
[Annie] Ray, you've got to be careful
the way that you handle this.

07:00.120 --> 07:02.160
Oh, this is great!

07:02.160 --> 07:03.520
Ray?

Alex! You are not
going to believe this!

You're not
going to believe it.

Who wants to fly?

[Robyn] You're his
friend. What's going on?

08:25.360 --> 08:28.560
Excuse me. Excuse me.

08:29.760 --> 08:32.200
Ray, you can't do
that stuff in the open.

08:32.200 --> 08:33.280
<i>Why not... Annie?</i>

08:33.280 --> 08:34.720
You know why not.

08:34.720 --> 08:36.520
That's all
for this performance, folks.

08:36.520 --> 08:39.240
Ray will do another show
tomorrow at 3:15.

08:39.240 --> 08:40.840
Right here
after school.

08:40.840 --> 08:42.880
Admission will be
five bucks.

08:42.880 --> 08:44.240
Tell everyone!

Raymond!

08:46.560 --> 08:47.320
Ray!

08:51.200 --> 08:52.760
Mom, Dad...

08:52.760 --> 08:56.000
There's something I think
I should talk to you about.

08:56.000 --> 08:58.240
Wait a second, Alex.
Ray's on TV!

08:58.240 --> 08:59.640
What?

08:59.640 --> 09:02.080
...we have signed
a five-year contract

09:02.080 --> 09:05.280
with "super" Ray Alvarado
and his new company...

09:05.280 --> 09:06.640
Alvarado enterprises.

09:06.640 --> 09:08.880
Ray will be
representing the Plant

09:08.880 --> 09:10.800
in promotions and advertising

09:10.800 --> 09:14.120
and we will be exploring
his wondrous new abilities

09:14.120 --> 09:16.320
and forging new products
together.

09:16.320 --> 09:19.000
First I thought it was
some special effects scam

09:19.000 --> 09:21.880
but it's looking more and more
like the real thing.

09:21.880 --> 09:24.480
[Man] When did you
discover these powers?

09:24.480 --> 09:27.120
Yesterday, hanging out
with my pal Alex Mack.

09:27.120 --> 09:28.720
Hey, Alex!

09:28.720 --> 09:30.520

09:30.520 --> 09:31.960
Alex, isn't that sweet?

09:31.960 --> 09:33.360

09:33.360 --> 09:34.720
Yeah, real sweet.

09:34.720 --> 09:37.480
[Woman] Can I get a shot
of you and your father?

09:37.480 --> 09:38.600
Why not?

09:38.600 --> 09:41.160
<i>( People shouting )</i>

Smile into the camera.

[Man 2] Can we see you
morph one more time?

09:45.560 --> 09:47.480
Sure.

09:47.480 --> 09:49.640
That'll be all
for today, people.

09:49.640 --> 09:52.680
We don't want to
overwork our star.

09:52.680 --> 09:56.000
<i>( People shouting )</i>

09:56.000 --> 09:58.000
It looks like
Ray's gone through

09:58.000 --> 10:01.000
some kind of amazing
molecular transformation.

10:01.000 --> 10:02.600
The press is going wild.

10:02.600 --> 10:05.360
Ray and his dad could get rich
off of this.

10:05.360 --> 10:07.600
Girls, couldn't
something like this

10:07.600 --> 10:09.520
have happened to you instead?

10:09.520 --> 10:10.720
<i>( Laughing )</i>

10:13.120 --> 10:15.680
You told me
not to use my powers in public.

10:15.680 --> 10:19.200
Ray's only had them for one day
and he's already famous.

10:19.200 --> 10:23.040
The Plant didn't turn him into
a test animal, they hired him.

10:23.040 --> 10:26.040
Alex, if I had to make
the choice all over again

10:26.040 --> 10:27.440
I'd make the same one.

10:27.440 --> 10:30.520
Well, this time I wouldn't have
listened to you.

10:41.240 --> 10:43.000
<i>( Applause )</i>

10:43.000 --> 10:45.320

Ray, could I get your autograph?

10:51.480 --> 10:53.160
<i>( Ray groans )</i>

10:53.160 --> 10:54.400
He takes another one.

10:54.400 --> 10:56.040
He shoots, he scores!

10:56.040 --> 10:57.600
The crowd goes wild.

10:57.600 --> 10:59.600
Hey, you're
a budding hoop star.

10:59.600 --> 11:01.120
How you doing, Raymond?

11:01.120 --> 11:02.240
Pretty good.

11:02.240 --> 11:03.520
Can I take a break?

11:03.520 --> 11:04.640
To do what?

11:04.640 --> 11:05.920
You know, hang out.

11:05.920 --> 11:07.960
Go see my friends,
play some ball.

11:07.960 --> 11:09.880
Sorry, you're going
to be busy.

11:09.880 --> 11:11.480
I'm not busy now.

11:11.480 --> 11:13.360
You will be.

11:21.400 --> 11:23.000
Ray!

11:23.000 --> 11:24.680
Hey, Raymond!

11:43.480 --> 11:46.400
Alex, is there
something wrong?

11:49.680 --> 11:51.480
I need to talk to you both.

11:52.800 --> 11:54.880
Is everything okay?

11:54.880 --> 11:58.000
Well... you know
what's going on with Ray?

11:58.000 --> 11:59.240
Well, honey, I think

11:59.240 --> 12:01.960
the whole world knows
what's going on with Ray.

12:01.960 --> 12:04.640
Well, it originally
happened to me.

12:04.640 --> 12:06.240
What do you mean, Alex?

12:06.240 --> 12:07.440
Remember,
last year

12:07.440 --> 12:09.320
that big plant truck accident

12:09.320 --> 12:10.360
near school?

12:10.360 --> 12:11.640
[Mr. Mack]
Sure.

12:11.640 --> 12:13.000
I was the kid.

12:13.000 --> 12:15.160
It got GC-161 all over me.

12:15.160 --> 12:17.120
I could do all
the things Ray can.

12:17.120 --> 12:19.600
I could shoot electricity
from my fingers.

12:19.600 --> 12:21.280
I could float objects to me

12:21.280 --> 12:24.320
and I could melt into liquid
whenever I wanted to.

12:24.320 --> 12:25.760
And you didn't tell us.

12:25.760 --> 12:27.640
No, Annie told me not to.

12:27.640 --> 12:29.600
We were afraid of Danielle

12:29.600 --> 12:31.400
and that Dad could
lose his job

12:31.400 --> 12:34.040
and they'd cut me up
and experiment on me.

12:34.040 --> 12:35.200
Alex!

12:35.200 --> 12:36.200
It's true!

12:36.200 --> 12:37.640
I had the powers
until yesterday

12:37.640 --> 12:39.320
when Vince
chased me and Ray

12:39.320 --> 12:41.320
and this lightning
got through us

12:41.320 --> 12:44.200
and the powers got transferred
from me to him.

12:44.200 --> 12:47.200
Alex, we know
what it must be like

12:47.200 --> 12:48.240
for you

12:48.240 --> 12:49.840
having a best friend

12:49.840 --> 12:52.760
suddenly become
so famous

12:52.760 --> 12:55.600
and it's natural that
you would be jealous.

12:55.600 --> 12:56.840
But do you really

12:56.840 --> 12:59.320
expect us to believe
what you're telling us?

12:59.320 --> 13:02.400
That you had super powers
all this time

13:02.400 --> 13:04.120
and not only did you
not tell us

13:04.120 --> 13:05.320
we never noticed?

13:05.320 --> 13:06.960
I did! You just never saw it.

13:06.960 --> 13:08.360
I did it in front of you.

13:08.360 --> 13:09.760
[Annie]
Good morning.

13:09.760 --> 13:10.720
Annie!

13:10.720 --> 13:11.960
I told Mom
and Dad

13:11.960 --> 13:13.760
about me having
the powers

13:13.760 --> 13:16.240
and about transferring
them to Ray.

13:16.240 --> 13:18.040
I told them
all about GC-161

13:18.040 --> 13:20.640
and how you told me
not to tell anyone.

13:20.640 --> 13:22.680
[Annie] What are
you talking about?

13:22.680 --> 13:25.200
[Alex] Please, they're
going to hurt Ray!

13:25.200 --> 13:26.560
We need to help him.

13:26.560 --> 13:29.480
Annie, didn't I have
the powers, didn't I?

13:29.480 --> 13:31.760
Alex, maybe
you should go and talk

13:31.760 --> 13:32.960
to Dr. Malamud.

13:32.960 --> 13:34.400
Why won't you help me?

13:34.400 --> 13:37.080
Tell them the truth!

13:42.960 --> 13:45.360
<i>[Mr. Alvarado]
Some of the plans concern me</i>

13:45.360 --> 13:48.000
so before we sign, I'd
like to discuss them.

13:48.000 --> 13:50.560
We don't want you concerned,
Mr. Alvarado.

13:50.560 --> 13:53.960
I don't want Ray to lose
the rest of his childhood.

13:53.960 --> 13:55.720
I know just how you feel.

13:55.720 --> 13:58.400
But Raymond is no longer
an ordinary kid

13:58.400 --> 14:00.200
with an ordinary
childhood.

14:00.200 --> 14:01.840
What we're
offering him

14:01.840 --> 14:05.040
is a chance at an education
and compensation for

14:05.040 --> 14:06.040
his newfound...

14:06.040 --> 14:07.640
talents.

14:07.640 --> 14:09.280
The money aside

14:09.280 --> 14:12.000
being a single working Dad,
it's hard for me

14:12.000 --> 14:13.760
to give him
enough attention.

14:13.760 --> 14:15.040
And with Ray
working

14:15.040 --> 14:17.240
we'll have even
less time together.

14:17.240 --> 14:20.600
Raymond will not be lacking
for attention, Mr. "A."

14:20.600 --> 14:23.240
I don't want his life
totally taken over

14:23.240 --> 14:24.800
by the Chemical Plant.

14:24.800 --> 14:25.960
Mr. Alvarado

14:25.960 --> 14:27.920
without stepping
on any toes here

14:27.920 --> 14:29.800
it's obvious
Raymond was the kid

14:29.800 --> 14:32.040
involved in the Plant
truck accident.

14:32.040 --> 14:33.560
Ray says
that's not true.

14:33.560 --> 14:34.600
Trust me

14:34.600 --> 14:35.600
it is.

14:35.600 --> 14:36.680
And not only that

14:36.680 --> 14:38.160
but Raymond lied to us

14:38.160 --> 14:39.600
repeatedly

14:39.600 --> 14:41.920
when he was
questioned about it.

14:41.920 --> 14:43.960
So, since his powers are due

14:43.960 --> 14:45.360
basically
to our work

14:45.360 --> 14:47.320
we, in effect, own him.

14:48.360 --> 14:50.720
I wouldn't go that far,
Miss Atron.

14:50.720 --> 14:53.240
As I was saying, Mr. Alvarado

14:53.240 --> 14:56.000
we have far-reaching
plans for your son

14:56.000 --> 14:57.480
but don't you worry.

14:57.480 --> 14:58.760
He'll receive

14:58.760 --> 15:00.320
the best private tutoring

15:00.320 --> 15:02.360
and will be
well protected by us.

15:02.360 --> 15:04.840
Vince will look after
his every need.

15:04.840 --> 15:06.920
With all due respect,
Miss Atron

15:06.920 --> 15:09.880
I've worked at the Plant
long enough to know

15:09.880 --> 15:13.400
I don't want a man like Vince
looking after my son.

15:13.400 --> 15:15.480
Now, why would you
say that?

15:15.480 --> 15:18.280
Vince is a thoughtful
and gentle man.

15:18.280 --> 15:19.600
<i>( Zapping )</i>

15:19.600 --> 15:20.960
Hey, any chance of me

15:20.960 --> 15:22.280
getting a break here?

15:22.280 --> 15:24.000
I'm getting a little tired.

15:24.000 --> 15:25.680
Another hour
and a half.

15:25.680 --> 15:27.720
Then it's on
to some morphing.

15:27.720 --> 15:30.840
Figure three hours,
you can take a short nap.

15:30.840 --> 15:32.360
But I want to see my friends.

15:32.360 --> 15:34.480
<i>Doesn't matter
what you want, Ray</i>

15:34.480 --> 15:36.320
you got a lot of work to do.

15:36.320 --> 15:37.360
<i>( Zapping )</i>

15:37.360 --> 15:39.440
I'm sorry I ever
got these powers.

15:39.440 --> 15:41.640
Don't talk like that.

15:41.640 --> 15:43.320
We're delighted
you got them.

15:43.320 --> 15:45.400
And if you'd come to us

15:45.400 --> 15:46.760
after the accident

15:46.760 --> 15:48.560
this would all be done by now

15:48.560 --> 15:50.320
life would be
back to normal.

15:50.320 --> 15:52.120
<i>( Knocking at door )</i>

15:52.120 --> 15:53.680
Do me a favor.

15:53.680 --> 15:56.680
Just lay back
and take it easy.

15:56.680 --> 15:57.760
<i>( Beeping )</i>

16:00.840 --> 16:03.160
Keep an eye on
our star, swifty.

16:06.000 --> 16:08.160
Yes, Miss Atron?

16:08.160 --> 16:10.720
He's getting us
no closer to our goal.

16:10.720 --> 16:13.520
He was doused with
with hundreds of times

16:13.520 --> 16:16.600
what the proposed dosage
of GC-161 should be.

16:16.600 --> 16:18.760
What I want to see
is the effect

16:18.760 --> 16:21.400
it should have on
his cells and organs.

16:21.400 --> 16:22.560
I understand.

16:24.360 --> 16:25.560
<i>( Machine beeping )</i>

16:45.760 --> 16:47.720
Vince:
So, we move forward.

16:47.720 --> 16:49.680
What are you
saying, Vince?

16:49.680 --> 16:52.560
I assume we move on
to the next phase.

16:52.560 --> 16:54.440
Yes, after
his father leaves.

16:54.440 --> 16:56.560
Then you prepare
the examination

16:56.560 --> 16:58.720
and I'll send out
a press release

16:58.720 --> 17:00.760
addressing Ray's
disappearance.

17:00.760 --> 17:02.400
And I'll go
on television

17:02.400 --> 17:05.319
saying how distraught
we are about our loss.

17:05.319 --> 17:08.440
Do you want my people to
take care of his father?

17:08.440 --> 17:10.319
Let's wait.
Perhaps more money

17:10.319 --> 17:12.520
will help him forget
about his son.

17:12.520 --> 17:15.720
If not, I'll make
other arrangements.

17:15.720 --> 17:18.400
I'll meet you
back at the lab.

17:23.079 --> 17:25.800
Good news, Mr. Alvarado.

17:28.280 --> 17:30.560
Time to unhook
our little fr...

<i>Vince ( Over loudspeaker ):

17:45.720 --> 17:46.960
Ray has escaped.

17:46.960 --> 17:48.920
He should be considered strange

17:48.920 --> 17:50.560
and extremely dangerous.

17:50.560 --> 17:54.320
I want a security phalanx
sent directly to his house.

17:54.320 --> 17:56.280
I'm going after him myself.

17:56.280 --> 17:58.800
Vince, we're here to
see our little star.

17:58.800 --> 18:01.080
Uh, well, you can't
see him right now.

18:01.080 --> 18:02.440
Why not? Where is he?

18:02.440 --> 18:03.440
We, uh, don't know.

18:03.440 --> 18:05.000
[Mr. Alvarado]
You don't know?

18:05.000 --> 18:07.040
What exactly
are you saying?

18:07.040 --> 18:08.400
We should have him

18:08.400 --> 18:11.160
back in cust...
I mean in no time.

18:11.160 --> 18:14.040
He seems to have escaped,
possibly.

18:14.040 --> 18:15.560
It's unconfirmed.

18:15.560 --> 18:18.880
Consider our contract off,
Miss Atron.

18:18.880 --> 18:21.480
Excuse me, I'm going
to find my son.

18:21.480 --> 18:23.440
Not so fast, sir.

Vince, Danielle.

18:56.840 --> 18:58.600
They want
to cut me up!

18:58.600 --> 19:00.400
What are you
talking about?

19:00.400 --> 19:02.560
I thought you
signed contracts.

No, not that way,

19:53.120 --> 19:54.360
Okay,

or the hard way.

No way!

Leave me alone.

19:59.840 --> 20:02.560
I heard you and
Danielle talking.

Let's go.

Nothing bad
will happen.
