WHAT'S GOING ON?

00:06.407 --> 00:07.708
WHAT DO WE GOT?

00:07.741 --> 00:09.143
- HE WAS HALFWAY THROUGH
A RIB EYE

00:09.177 --> 00:10.044
WHEN HE GRABBED HIS CHEST
AND WENT DOWN.

00:10.078 --> 00:11.312
HE'S NOT BREATHING.

00:11.345 --> 00:12.646
- ALL RIGHT.

[thump]

00:29.130 --> 00:30.798
NOTHING.

00:33.033 --> 00:34.202
CLEAR.

00:34.235 --> 00:35.436
[whine, thump]

00:35.469 --> 00:38.072
[beeping]
THERE HE IS.

00:38.106 --> 00:39.773
- OH, THANK GOD.
- RIGHT?

00:43.043 --> 00:45.579
- ONE, TWO, THREE.

00:45.613 --> 00:47.581
THERE WE GO.

00:47.615 --> 00:51.452
- THE SERVICE WAS LOVELY.
MR. O'SHEA HAD A WONDERFUL TIME.

00:53.954 --> 00:56.090
- I KNEW IT WAS HIM.
- WHO IS IT, A LOCAL CELEBRITY,

00:56.124 --> 00:57.425
SOME SPORTS GUY
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT?

00:57.458 --> 00:58.926
IS THIS DITKA?

00:58.959 --> 01:00.861
- DO YOU SEE A HALO?
IT'S JIMMY O.

01:00.894 --> 01:02.730
- OH, THE GUY FROM THE MATTRESS
STORE COMMERCIALS.

01:02.763 --> 01:05.699
NO, THAT'S JIMMY C.
THE C IS FOR CRAZY SAVINGS.

01:05.733 --> 01:07.801
- NO, JIMMY O'SHEA,
OLD-SCHOOL IRISH MOBSTER.

01:07.835 --> 01:09.270
- LIKE WHITEY BULGER,
BUT LESS SUCCESSFUL.

01:09.303 --> 01:11.372
- YEAH, AND LESS IN JAIL.
- WOW.

01:11.405 --> 01:13.141
IF I WERE A MOBSTER,
I'D NEVER GO TO RESTAURANTS

01:13.174 --> 01:15.109
'CAUSE THAT'S WHERE
ALL THE HITS HAPPEN.

01:15.143 --> 01:16.710
- IF YOU WERE A MOBSTER, YOU'D
DIE YOUR FIRST DAY OF WORK.

01:16.744 --> 01:18.546
- NO, I WOULDN'T,
'CAUSE I'D ORDER IN.

01:18.579 --> 01:20.047
- YOU SHOULD TEACH
MOBSTER SCHOOL, BRIAN.

01:20.080 --> 01:22.150
YOU'VE GOT A LOT OF GOOD IDEAS.
- HEY, HOLD UP.

01:22.183 --> 01:24.218
- OH, I'M SORRY, SIR.
YOU CAN'T RIDE WITH US.

01:24.252 --> 01:25.586
BUT YOU CAN FOLLOW US
TO CITY HOSPITAL.

01:25.619 --> 01:27.721
- I GO WHERE MR. O'SHEA GOES.

01:27.755 --> 01:28.889
COME HERE.

01:28.922 --> 01:29.990
WATCH MY CAR.

01:30.023 --> 01:30.958
- I'M JUST ABOUT TO GET OFF.

01:30.991 --> 01:33.127
- NO, YOU'RE NOT.

01:33.161 --> 01:36.096
[hip-hop music]

01:36.130 --> 01:39.099

01:39.133 --> 01:40.234
[siren wailing]

01:40.268 --> 01:41.669
- TAKE MADISON.

01:41.702 --> 01:42.770
- OH, WE'LL GET HIM THERE, SIR.

01:42.803 --> 01:44.505
- MADISON IS FASTEST.

01:44.538 --> 01:46.240
- WELL, WE GOT THE SIREN,
SO WE'RE GOOD TO GO.

01:46.274 --> 01:48.509
- YOU'RE GONNA TAKE MADISON.

01:48.542 --> 01:50.344
- YEAH, MADISON ALL THE WAY.

01:50.378 --> 01:52.513
- [muttering]
- WHAT'S THAT, BOSS?

01:52.546 --> 01:54.014
- HE SAID SHUT THE HELL UP,
FAT EDDIE.

01:54.047 --> 01:55.183
CAN I HAVE SOME OXYGEN PLEASE,
HANK?

01:55.216 --> 01:57.751
- SURE.
- DOES MR. O'SHEA

01:57.785 --> 02:00.020
HAVE YOU CONFUSED
WITH PERHAPS A HEAVIER EDDIE?

02:00.053 --> 02:02.290
IF ANYTHING,
YOU SEEM LIKE A SKINNY EDDIE.

02:02.323 --> 02:04.825
I ONLY ASK SO WE CAN DETERMINE
HOW HIS BRAIN IS FUNCTIONING.

02:04.858 --> 02:05.993
- NO, I'M FAT EDDIE.

02:06.026 --> 02:07.761
I USED TO BE OBESE.

02:07.795 --> 02:09.463
BUT THEN I CHANGED MY LIFESTYLE

02:09.497 --> 02:10.964
BECAUSE I COULD SEE
THIS IS WHERE I WAS HEADED.

02:10.998 --> 02:12.700
- [muttering]

02:12.733 --> 02:16.003
- WHAT, BOSS?
- [mutters]

02:16.036 --> 02:17.305
- TELL THE MAN.

02:17.338 --> 02:18.672
- PUSSY.

02:18.706 --> 02:20.508
HE CALLED YOU A PUSSY.

02:20.541 --> 02:22.176
- 25 YEARS I'VE BEEN TELLING HIM
TO CUT BACK ON THE MEAT,

02:22.210 --> 02:23.611
BUT HE WON'T.

02:23.644 --> 02:25.779
YOU KNOW WHY HE EATS
AT THAT PLACE?

02:25.813 --> 02:28.949
'CAUSE THEY PUT A BIG SLAB
OF BUTTER ON THE STEAK.

02:28.982 --> 02:30.150
I TOLD HIM
THIS WAS GONNA HAPPEN,

02:30.184 --> 02:34.488
BUT DOES HE LISTEN TO ME?

02:34.522 --> 02:36.624
- OH, I THOUGHT
THAT WAS A RHETORICAL QUESTION.

02:36.657 --> 02:38.459
UM...NO?

02:38.492 --> 02:40.228
- CORRECT.
NO.

02:40.261 --> 02:42.029
EVEN WHEN I LOST ALL THAT WEIGHT

02:42.062 --> 02:46.234
WORKING MY BALLS OFF
ON THAT GODDAMNED ELLIPTICAL.

02:46.267 --> 02:48.202
- THAT'S A GIRL'S MACHINE.

02:48.236 --> 02:50.638
- HE SAID THAT THAT'S ACTUALLY--
- I KNOW WHAT HE SAID.

02:50.671 --> 02:54.308
YEAH, I-I CHOOSE NOT TO HEAR
WHEN HE GETS LIKE THIS.

02:54.342 --> 02:56.043
- HOW WE DOING UP THERE, JOHNNY?

02:56.076 --> 02:58.546
[siren wailing]

02:59.947 --> 03:01.682
- JIMMY O, HUH?
- HUH?

03:01.715 --> 03:03.183
- THAT GUY IS NO JOKE.

03:03.217 --> 03:04.918
I HEARD HE ONCE CUT OFF
A WAITER'S FINGER

03:04.952 --> 03:07.020
FOR PUTTING THE SPOON
NEXT TO THE FORK.

03:07.054 --> 03:08.322
THEY GO ON OPPOSITE SIDES
OF THE PLATE.

03:08.356 --> 03:10.224
REMEMBER THAT.

03:10.258 --> 03:11.559
- YOU SURE HE WASN'T
TRYING TO EAT THE GUY'S FINGERS?

03:11.592 --> 03:13.160
- [laughing]

03:13.193 --> 03:15.195
- HOMEBOY IS HUGE,
BUTTER-ON-STEAK STYLE.

03:15.229 --> 03:17.831
- THAT'S WILD--YOU GUYS HAD
A MURDERER'S LIFE IN YOUR HANDS.

03:17.865 --> 03:19.267
- YEAH.
- WE DID, INDEED.

03:19.300 --> 03:20.501
- IT'S A SHAME
OUR JOBS PREVENT US

03:20.534 --> 03:21.869
FROM KILLING PEOPLE LIKE THAT.

03:21.902 --> 03:23.203
- YEAH, AND LAWS IN GENERAL.

03:23.237 --> 03:24.772
- YEAH,
BUT YOU KNOW HOW LONG THE COPS

03:24.805 --> 03:26.407
HAVE BEEN TRYING
TO TAKE THAT DUDE DOWN?

03:26.440 --> 03:28.041
WHAT'S THE POINT
OF HAVING ALL THIS POWER

03:28.075 --> 03:30.177
IF WE CAN'T USE IT?
- IT'S THE OATH WE TAKE.

03:30.210 --> 03:32.780
WE DO OUR BEST TO SAVE
WHOEVER'S PUT IN FRONT OF US

03:32.813 --> 03:34.114
WHETHER THEY'RE GOOD OR EVIL.

03:34.147 --> 03:35.849
DOPE DEALERS, GANG BANGERS,

03:35.883 --> 03:38.452
DICTATORS--DOESN'T MATTER,
YOU SAVE THEM.

03:38.486 --> 03:40.354
- AND BESIDES,
JIMMY O ISN'T ALL BAD.

03:40.388 --> 03:42.256
- ARE YOU KIDDING ME?
- I'M NOT SAYING THE GUY'S

03:42.290 --> 03:44.358
A SAINT, BUT HE DID KEEP A KIND
OF PEACE IN MY NEIGHBORHOOD,

03:44.392 --> 03:45.793
AND HE PAID FOR ALL KINDS
OF COOL SH--

03:45.826 --> 03:47.227
LIKE A CARNIVAL EVERY YEAR.

03:47.261 --> 03:48.796
HE BUILT US A LITTLE LEAGUE
FIELD,

03:48.829 --> 03:50.564
LIKE, THE BEST LITTLE LEAGUE
FIELD IN THE CITY.

03:50.598 --> 03:53.066
IT HAD THESE COOL DUGOUTS
JUST LIKE A BIG LEAGUE STADIUM.

03:53.100 --> 03:54.935
- HE BOUGHT IT WITH BLOOD MONEY,
JOHN.

03:54.968 --> 03:56.370
- I DON'T CARE, HANK.

03:56.404 --> 03:59.072
DUGOUTS.
BELOW THE GROUND DUGOUTS.

03:59.106 --> 04:01.275
- SO WHO'S THE WORST PERSON
THAT EVERYONE HERE HAS SAVED?

04:01.309 --> 04:03.143
- YOUR MOM.

04:03.176 --> 04:05.145
OH, MY GOD.
OH, I DIDN'T EVEN--

04:05.178 --> 04:06.814
I DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHERE THAT CAME FROM.

04:06.847 --> 04:08.882
- THAT WAS REALLY GOOD.

04:08.916 --> 04:13.253
- HANK, WORST PERSON
YOU'VE SAVED.

04:13.287 --> 04:15.456
- AARON RODGERS.
- BULLSH--.

04:15.489 --> 04:17.291
- WHO'S--
- PACKERS QUARTERBACK.

04:17.325 --> 04:19.793
- I NEVER TOLD YOU ABOUT IT
BECAUSE I WAS TOO ASHAMED.

04:19.827 --> 04:22.396
- YOU NEVER TOLD ME ABOUT
IT 'CAUSE IT NEVER HAPPENED.

04:22.430 --> 04:24.898
- REMEMBER WHEN I WAS EARNING
EXTRA CASH AS A SET MEDIC?

04:24.932 --> 04:26.500
- YEAH.
- I WORKED ON A COMMERCIAL

04:26.534 --> 04:28.836
FOR SOME LAME POTATO CHIP
COMPANY,

04:28.869 --> 04:30.338
AND AARON RODGERS WAS IN IT.

04:30.371 --> 04:32.239
- OH, OF COURSE HE WAS.
DICK.

04:32.272 --> 04:33.741
- YEAH. ANYWAY,
IN THE COMMERCIAL,

04:33.774 --> 04:35.843
HE HAD TO CATCH A PASS
FROM A LITTLE KID.

04:35.876 --> 04:38.178
- I LOVE THAT COMMERCIAL.
THAT KID'S SO CUTE.

04:38.211 --> 04:40.013
READ HE WAS A PROBLEM ON SET,
THOUGH.

04:40.047 --> 04:41.281
- WHERE WOULD YOU READ
SOMETHING LIKE THAT?

04:41.315 --> 04:43.817
- MM-HMM, LITTLE SH--
HAD AN ARM.

04:43.851 --> 04:45.653
AND ON THE FIRST TAKE,
RODGERS WASN'T PREPARED FOR IT.

04:45.686 --> 04:47.321
CAUGHT THE BALL WRONG.

04:47.355 --> 04:51.492
DISLOCATED HIS MIDDLE FINGER
ON HIS RIGHT HAND.

04:51.525 --> 04:53.494
- HIS THROWING HAND?
- YEAH.

04:53.527 --> 04:55.763
AND IF I HADN'T POPPED
IT BACK IN RIGHT THEN AND THERE,

04:55.796 --> 04:57.865
HE WOULD HAVE MISSED
THE NFC TITLE GAME

04:57.898 --> 04:59.433
WHEN THEY BEAT US TO GO
TO THE SUPER BOWL.

04:59.467 --> 05:00.701
- 2010.

05:00.734 --> 05:02.670
HOLY SH--.
YOU SON OF A BITCH.

05:02.703 --> 05:05.473
THAT LITTLE KID ACTOR WOULD HAVE
BEEN A GODDAMN AMERICAN HERO,

05:05.506 --> 05:07.140
AND YOU--YOU RUINED IT.

05:07.174 --> 05:08.842
I CAN'T EVEN
LOOK AT YOU RIGHT NOW.

05:08.876 --> 05:10.711
- JOHN, YOU JUST SAVED A MAN

05:10.744 --> 05:12.846
WHO MOST CERTAINLY HAS BLOOD
ON HIS HANDS.

05:12.880 --> 05:14.181
- THAT HAS NEVER BEEN PROVEN,

05:14.214 --> 05:15.282
BUT YOU KNOW
WHAT HAS BEEN PROVEN?

05:15.315 --> 05:17.017
YOU, HENRY ISAIAH ST. CLARE--

05:17.050 --> 05:17.985
- ISAIAH'S YOUR MIDDLE NAME?

05:18.018 --> 05:19.319
SO REGAL.
- BRIAN.

05:19.353 --> 05:22.690
YOU...COST THE BEARS
THE SUPER BOWL.

05:22.723 --> 05:24.492
- THANK YOU, BRIAN.

05:24.525 --> 05:26.326
CUTLER'S KNEE
COST THE BEARS THE SUPER BOWL,

05:26.360 --> 05:28.396
AND JIMMY O MOST CERTAINLY

05:28.429 --> 05:30.631
HAS BLOOD ON HIS HANDS,
HIS ARMS, HIS--

05:30.664 --> 05:31.799
- YOU DON'T GET
TO WEAR BEARS GEAR ANYMORE.

05:31.832 --> 05:33.501
- IT HAS BEEN FOUR YEARS, JOHN.

05:33.534 --> 05:35.536
- YOU DON'T GET TO WEAR
BEARS GEAR FOR FOUR YEARS.

05:35.569 --> 05:37.705
- UH, YOU DON'T GET TO TELL ME
WHAT I GET TO WEAR.

05:37.738 --> 05:40.974
AND ANOTHER THING, HE WAS NICE.
- YOU TAKE THAT BACK.

05:41.008 --> 05:42.743
- ELLEN DEGENERES NICE.
- TAKE IT BACK!

05:42.776 --> 05:44.545
- NICE, NICE, NICE.
- OH.

05:44.578 --> 05:47.415
- CAN YOU BELIEVE THAT
THOSE GUYS SAVED JIMMY O TODAY?

05:47.448 --> 05:48.916
SEE, THAT'S
WHY I WANT TO JOIN THE FBI,

05:48.949 --> 05:50.651
SO I CAN TAKE SCUMBAGS
LIKE THAT DOWN.

05:50.684 --> 05:51.752
- AW, COME ON.

05:51.785 --> 05:53.086
JIMMY O'S ALL RIGHT, T.

05:53.120 --> 05:54.187
HE GAVE THE KIDS
IN MY NEIGHBORHOOD

05:54.221 --> 05:55.389
A HORSE ONE TIME.

05:55.423 --> 05:57.057
WAIT, NOT A HORSE.

05:57.090 --> 05:58.492
WHAT'S THE THING THAT'S A HORSE,

05:58.526 --> 06:01.829
BUT, LIKE, A SMALLER HORSE?
- A PONY?

06:01.862 --> 06:04.498
- YEAH, A PONY.
- I GUESS THAT'S NICE.

06:04.532 --> 06:06.333
- YEAH, THAT PONY
WAS AN ASSHOLE, THOUGH.

06:06.366 --> 06:07.568
HE WOULDN'T LET ANYBODY RIDE IT.

06:07.601 --> 06:09.169
I TRIED, LIKE, 100 TIMES.

06:09.202 --> 06:12.339
I GAVE HIM SUGAR CUBES
AND CARROTS AND HAY.

06:12.372 --> 06:13.674
I MUST HAVE TRIED EVERYTHING,

06:13.707 --> 06:15.609
BUT THAT PONY WAS LIKE,
"HELL NO, SON.

06:15.643 --> 06:17.678
YOU AIN'T GETTING NO RIDES."

06:17.711 --> 06:19.447
THAT PONY WAS A STRAIGHT
UP DICK.

06:19.480 --> 06:21.381
I MISS HIM EVERY DAY.

06:21.415 --> 06:23.551
- HEY, WELL, MAYBE ONE DAY
YOU'LL MEET AGAIN.

06:23.584 --> 06:25.018
- MM-HMM.

06:25.052 --> 06:26.954
- WHAT WAS THE PONY'S NAME?
- TONY.

06:26.987 --> 06:30.491
- HA-HA. TONY THE PONY.
- NAH, JUST TONY.

06:37.397 --> 06:38.966
- HEY, 14?

06:38.999 --> 06:41.969
SOME GUY NAMED EDDIE
JUST CALLED.

06:42.002 --> 06:43.737
- WHAT'D HE WANT?
- SAID HE NEEDS YOU GUYS

06:43.771 --> 06:45.105
TO GO TO THE HOSPITAL.

06:45.138 --> 06:46.740
HIS FRIEND JIMMY
WANTS TO TALK TO YOU?

06:46.774 --> 06:50.143
- OH, SH--.
- HE SOUNDED CRYPTIC AND CUTE.

06:50.177 --> 06:51.879
WAS HE CUTE?
- HE WAS OKAY.

06:51.912 --> 06:54.147
KIND EYES,
LOST A LOT OF WEIGHT RECENTLY.

06:54.181 --> 06:56.316
I'D SAY GO FOR IT.
- NO, DON'T GO FOR IT.

06:56.349 --> 06:58.819
HE IS A CRIMINAL.
- DANGEROUS AND CUTE?

06:58.852 --> 07:00.754
NOW YOU'RE JUST
SWEETENING THE POT.

07:04.191 --> 07:05.759
- YO.

07:05.793 --> 07:06.794
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

07:06.827 --> 07:08.261
- HANK CALLED US FOR BACKUP.

07:08.295 --> 07:09.897
- YOU CALLED MY GIRLFRIEND
FOR PROTECTION?

07:09.930 --> 07:11.932
- YES, I DID, BECAUSE
YOUR GIRLFRIEND IS A COP,

07:11.965 --> 07:13.100
AND THOSE GUYS ARE MURDERERS.

07:13.133 --> 07:14.668
- THEY'RE ALLEGED MURDERERS.

07:14.702 --> 07:15.903
- HEY, ME AND ALL THE KIDS
IN MY NEIGHBORHOOD

07:15.936 --> 07:17.771
WORSHIPPED JIMMY O.
HE WAS THE MAN.

07:17.805 --> 07:19.740
- YEAH? DID HE BUILD YOU GUYS
A LITTLE LEAGUE FIELD, TOO?

07:19.773 --> 07:21.408
- NO, BUT HE GAVE US
A JERK PONY.

07:21.441 --> 07:23.644
- MM.
ALL RIGHT, YOU GO IN FIRST.

07:23.677 --> 07:25.245
YOU GOT THE LOOK.
- WHAT LOOK?

07:25.278 --> 07:28.281
- TALL, JACKED, INTIMIDATING.
- BLACK?

07:28.315 --> 07:29.817
- I--IT DOESN'T HURT.

07:29.850 --> 07:30.851
- HE DIDN'T BUILD ME A DUGOUT.

07:30.884 --> 07:32.352
YOU LEAD.
- I CAN'T.

07:32.385 --> 07:34.121
ALL RIGHT, LET'S ROCK,
PAPER, SCISSORS.

07:34.154 --> 07:35.956
YEAH?
- YEAH.

07:35.989 --> 07:39.026
I MEAN, THAT WORKS, TOO.

07:39.059 --> 07:40.327
I THINK IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN HIM,
ANYWAY.

07:40.360 --> 07:42.630
- YEAH, BRIAN, THANKS.

07:42.663 --> 07:43.997
- MR. O'SHEA?

07:44.031 --> 07:47.000
YOU WANTED TO SEE US?

07:50.971 --> 07:55.809
- I-I WANT TO THANK YOU
THREE FOR SAVING MY LIFE.

07:55.843 --> 07:58.478
I OWE YOU.
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

07:58.512 --> 08:00.548
- WE--WE DIDN'T EXPECT A GIFT,
BUT--

08:00.581 --> 08:02.315
- BUT I MEAN,
IF YOU--SINCE YOU OFFERED.

08:02.349 --> 08:03.884
- WHAT DO WE WANT?

08:03.917 --> 08:05.686
WE WANT YOU
TO MAKE SOME CHANGES.

08:05.719 --> 08:07.487
- BRIAN?
- MR. O'SHEA,

08:07.521 --> 08:09.690
I WILL SAVE YOUR LIFE,
BUT I WILL NOT HOLD MY TONGUE.

08:09.723 --> 08:11.659
- WHAT BRIAN'S TRYING
TO SAY IS--

08:11.692 --> 08:13.360
- AND I WOULD BE REMISS IF I
DIDN'T TAKE THIS OPPORTUNITY

08:13.393 --> 08:14.828
TO GIVE YOU SOME HARD TRUTHS.

08:14.862 --> 08:16.229
- WHAT KIND OF HARD TRUTHS?

08:16.263 --> 08:18.666
- YOUR DIET IS HORRENDOUS.

08:18.699 --> 08:21.201
THAT STEAK AND LINGUINE
IS A ONE-WAY TICKET OUT OF HERE,

08:21.234 --> 08:23.571
MISTER, IN A BODY BAG.

08:23.604 --> 08:25.205
- THAT'S WHAT I'VE BEEN
TELLING HIM.

08:25.238 --> 08:30.077
ALL THAT FRICKING FAT
AND GLUTEN, IT'S POISON.

08:30.110 --> 08:31.511
- I THOUGHT
YOU WERE ABOUT TO LECTURE ME

08:31.545 --> 08:33.513
ABOUT MY BUSINESS ACTIVITIES.

08:33.547 --> 08:36.684
- OH, NO.
- NEVER, DUGOUTS.

08:36.717 --> 08:38.819
- LOOK, I STRESS EAT.

08:38.852 --> 08:40.721
- WE ALL DO.
- FOR ME, IT'S DONUTS.

08:40.754 --> 08:42.355
- BUSINESS IS BAD LATELY.

08:42.389 --> 08:44.491
WE GOT HIT REALLY HARD
WITH THE RECESSION.

08:44.524 --> 08:46.560
THE NUMBERS BUSINESS
IS PRACTICALLY DEAD.

08:46.594 --> 08:48.528
IT'S ALL SCRATCH CARDS, NOW.

08:48.562 --> 08:51.098
THERE'S NO UNIONS ANYMORE,
JUST WALMART

08:51.131 --> 08:55.836
AND THE FREAKING CHINESE.

08:55.869 --> 08:57.337
YOU KNOW WHAT BUSINESS
WE SHOULD HAVE STAYED IN?

08:57.370 --> 08:59.006
SPEAKEASIES.

08:59.039 --> 09:01.541
MY DAUGHTER TOOK ME
TO ONE IN WICKER PARK.

09:01.575 --> 09:05.012
SOME ASSHOLE IN SUSPENDERS
AND A SMALL HAT CHARGED ME $15

09:05.045 --> 09:06.680
FOR A WHISKEY SODA.

09:06.714 --> 09:09.049
- OH, THAT DUMP ON DAMEN.
- OH, I HATE THAT JOINT.

09:09.082 --> 09:13.186
- MR. O'SHEA, IF I MAY,
YOU'RE IN A CYCLE.

09:13.220 --> 09:15.723
YOU'RE UNDER A LOT
OF STRESS, SO YOU EAT POORLY,

09:15.756 --> 09:18.592
AND THAT MAKES YOU SAD,
WHICH STRESSES YOU OUT MORE,

09:18.626 --> 09:19.960
AND SO YOU EAT MORE JUNK,

09:19.993 --> 09:22.295
AND THAT MAKES YOU MORE STRESSED
AND SAD,

09:22.329 --> 09:24.932
AND I THINK YOU SEE
WHERE I'M GOING WITH THIS.

09:24.965 --> 09:27.467
IT FEEDS ON ITSELF.
INTENTIONAL PUN.

09:27.500 --> 09:28.368
- WE SHOULD LET YOU
GET SOME REST.

09:28.401 --> 09:30.437
- YEAH.

09:30.470 --> 09:32.239
- ALL I'M SAYING IS PUT DOWN
THE MEAT, PICK UP THE VEGGIES.

09:32.272 --> 09:33.607
PUT SOME COLOR ON THAT PLATE.

09:33.641 --> 09:36.143
- YES.
EAT FROM THE RAINBOW, JIMMY.

09:36.176 --> 09:37.444
- YOU KNOW WHAT'S AT THE END
OF THAT RAINBOW?

09:37.477 --> 09:39.647
HEALTH.
AND WHO KNOWS?

09:39.680 --> 09:41.548
YOU MAY START FEELING A LITTLE
BIT BETTER ABOUT YOURSELF,

09:41.581 --> 09:44.484
STOP DOING THE MURDERY STUFF.

09:44.517 --> 09:47.287
- ALLEGED.
- I NEVER SPENT A NIGHT IN JAIL.

09:47.320 --> 09:50.590
- MR. O'SHEA, YOU'VE BEEN
GIVEN A SECOND CHANCE,

09:50.624 --> 09:52.993
AN OPPORTUNITY TO DO THINGS
A LITTLE DIFFERENTLY.

09:53.026 --> 09:55.462
BUT DON'T CHANGE FOR ME.

09:55.495 --> 09:58.766
CHANGE FOR YOU,
FOR YOUR DAUGHTER,

09:58.799 --> 10:00.067
FOR FAT SKINNY EDDIE.

10:00.100 --> 10:01.669
YOU GOT A FRIEND AND A COWORKER

10:01.702 --> 10:03.436
WHO CARES AN AWFUL LOT
ABOUT YOU,

10:03.470 --> 10:06.674
AND THAT MAKES YOU
ONE FREAKING LUCKY GUY.

10:06.707 --> 10:09.109
- I APPRECIATE YOUR HONESTY,
KID,

10:09.142 --> 10:11.411
AND I'LL TRY
TO MAKE SOME CHANGES,

10:11.444 --> 10:13.180
IF ONLY SO YOU'LL STOP TALKING.

10:13.213 --> 10:15.983
- OKAY.
[uncomfortable laughter]

10:16.016 --> 10:17.818
- THANK YOU, MR. O'SHEA.
- THANK YOU.

10:17.851 --> 10:19.319
- THANK YOU.
- MM-HMM.

10:19.352 --> 10:21.221
THANKS SO MUCH.

10:24.224 --> 10:27.661
- HEY, MR. O, ON BEHALF
OF ALL THE KIDS ON 26th STREET,

10:27.695 --> 10:31.164
THANK YOU FOR THE PONY.

10:31.198 --> 10:32.933
OH, WHAT'S UP, MAN?
YOU LOSE SOME WEIGHT, BRO?

10:32.966 --> 10:34.467
- 96 POUNDS.

10:34.501 --> 10:36.804
- YEAH, YOU DID.

10:36.837 --> 10:39.539
YEAH, YOU DID, MAN.

10:43.977 --> 10:45.779
- YES, WE SAVED JIMMY O'S LIFE,

10:45.813 --> 10:48.015
BUT DO YOU KNOW
WHO THE REAL HERO IS?

10:48.048 --> 10:49.817
NO.
[laughs]

10:49.850 --> 10:51.719
NO, NO, IT'S NOT ME.

10:51.752 --> 10:54.321
FAT SKINNY EDDIE
IS THE REAL HERO.

10:54.354 --> 10:56.990
I MEAN, IT'S EASY FOR ME TO WALK
IN THERE WITH THE FULL WEIGHT

10:57.024 --> 10:58.792
OF MY EXPERTISE AND SAY,

10:58.826 --> 11:01.661
"CHANGE THIS, CHANGE THAT."
BUT EDDIE'S THE ONE

11:01.695 --> 11:04.798
WHO'S GOT TO BE THERE EVERY DAY
MAKING SURE THE CHANGE STICKS,

11:04.832 --> 11:06.633
AND THAT'S THE ONLY WAY
IT'S GONNA WORK, 'CAUSE

11:06.666 --> 11:09.903
THE TRUTH IS IT'S YOUR COWORKERS
WHO KNOW YOU BEST.

11:09.937 --> 11:11.805
- WELL,
TAKE THIS FROM YOUR COWORKER.

11:11.839 --> 11:14.174
WHEN YOU GET ON YOUR HIGH HORSE,
YOU'RE AN ASS.

11:14.207 --> 11:16.476
- I WAS GONNA SAY EXACTLY
THE SAME THING, EXCEPT DICK,

11:16.509 --> 11:18.011
BUT I LIKE WHAT YOU DID
WITH THE ASS BIT 'CAUSE

11:18.045 --> 11:19.312
IT'S A PLAY BACK ON THE HORSE.
- THANK YOU.

11:19.346 --> 11:21.214
- OKAY, OKAY,

11:21.248 --> 11:23.583
I'LL TAKE YOUR CRITICISM
TO HEART BECAUSE IT'S THE PEOPLE

11:23.616 --> 11:26.186
YOU WORK WITH WHO REALLY
DO KNOW YOU BEST.

11:26.219 --> 11:28.188
I THINK WE'VE ALL IDENTIFIED
CERTAIN AREAS

11:28.221 --> 11:30.490
IN ONE ANOTHER THAT NEED
IMPROVING, SO I'LL GO FIRST.

11:30.523 --> 11:32.592
- NO, NO, NO, NO.
- NOPE, NOPE, NOPE.

11:32.625 --> 11:34.227
- WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT WHAT
WE'D CHANGE ABOUT EACH OTHER.

11:34.261 --> 11:35.996
I TRIED THAT WITH THERESA ONCE.
IT DID NOT GO WELL.

11:36.029 --> 11:38.832
- STRANGE, I HEARD IRISH COPS
TAKE CRITICISM VERY WELL.

11:38.866 --> 11:40.667
- YOU KNOW, WEIRDLY,
I'VE HEARD THE OPPOSITE.

11:40.700 --> 11:42.402
- BRIAN, LISTEN.

11:42.435 --> 11:44.604
PEOPLE HAVE BEEN TRYING
TO CHANGE ME MY ENTIRE LIFE,

11:44.637 --> 11:46.606
AND TRUST ME,
IT'S INCREDIBLY ANNOYING.

11:46.639 --> 11:48.508
- LOOK, I'M NOT TALKING
ABOUT BIG CHANGES, HERE,

11:48.541 --> 11:51.611
FELLAS, JUST LITTLE,
SMALL, MINI ONES, TWEAKS.

11:51.644 --> 11:54.915
FOR EXAMPLE,
SOMETIMES I THINK THAT

11:54.948 --> 11:56.616
I LOOK UP TO YOU GUYS TOO MUCH,
AND THAT'S A LOT OF PRESSURE.

11:56.649 --> 11:58.251
I SHOULD PROBABLY DIAL
THAT DOWN.

11:58.285 --> 11:59.386
- NOT NECESSARILY.
- NO, I THINK YOU'RE GOOD.

11:59.419 --> 12:01.221
- AND HANK--

12:01.254 --> 12:02.522
- NO, YOU DON'T NEED
TO GO AROUND THE HORN, BRI.

12:02.555 --> 12:04.224
WE'RE NOT PLAYING.
- NO, NO, JOHN.

12:04.257 --> 12:06.226
I WOULD LOVE TO HEAR WHAT BRIAN
WOULD CHANGE ABOUT ME.

12:06.259 --> 12:08.061
- THANK YOU, HANK.

12:08.095 --> 12:09.696
- HMM?
- HMM.

12:09.729 --> 12:13.466
SOMETIMES WHEN YOU ASK
FOR THINGS IN THE RIG,

12:13.500 --> 12:15.735
YOUR TONE CAN BE A LITTLE
AGGRESSIVE.

12:15.769 --> 12:17.270
- THAT'S BECAUSE I NEED THINGS
AGGRESSIVELY.

12:17.304 --> 12:18.872
- IT'S NOT EVERY WORD,

12:18.906 --> 12:21.374
MOSTLY THE WAY YOU SAY "GAUZE."
- OH, TOTALLY.

12:21.408 --> 12:23.243
- YOU BARK IT OUT, RIGHT?
- WELL THEN,

12:23.276 --> 12:25.412
SH--HEADS, HOW WOULD YOU LIKE
ME TO SAY THE WORD "GAUZE?"

12:25.445 --> 12:26.546
- WITH SOFTER CONSONANTS,

12:26.579 --> 12:28.448
LIKE GAUZE.

12:28.481 --> 12:30.050
- GAUZE.
- NO, LIKE THIS.

12:30.083 --> 12:31.551
GAUZE.

12:31.584 --> 12:32.585
- GAUZE.

12:32.619 --> 12:34.287
- GAUZE.
- G-GAUZE?

12:34.321 --> 12:35.488
both: GAUZE.
- G-GAU--

12:35.522 --> 12:36.824
- NO, LIKE THIS.
- NO.

12:36.857 --> 12:38.125
- WATCH THIS.
- WATCH HIM.

12:38.158 --> 12:39.392
- GAUZE.
- YEAH, HE'S DOING IT.

12:39.426 --> 12:40.293
- GAUZE.
- IT'S JUST, LIKE, GAUZE.

12:40.327 --> 12:41.461
- GAUZE.
- GAUZE.

12:41.494 --> 12:42.462
- GAUZE.
- GAUZE?

12:42.495 --> 12:43.630
- NO, NO.
SHH.

12:43.663 --> 12:45.465
- WATCH.
WATCH MY MOUTH, GAUZE.

12:45.498 --> 12:46.733
- GAUZE.
- GAUZE.

12:46.766 --> 12:47.767
- GAUZE.

12:47.801 --> 12:48.969
- GAUZE.
- GAUZE.

12:49.002 --> 12:50.070
- YOU'RE A LITTLE CLOSE.
- GAUZE?

12:50.103 --> 12:51.304
- GAUZE.
- GAUZE.

12:51.338 --> 12:52.272
both: GAUZE.

12:52.305 --> 12:53.673
- GAUZE.

12:53.706 --> 12:55.108
HEY,
HOW ABOUT--HOW ABOUT SOME GAUZE?

12:55.142 --> 12:56.276
- HEY, GAUZE.
- HEY, HAVE SOME GAUZE.

12:56.309 --> 12:57.310
- GAUZE!
- GAUZE.

12:57.344 --> 12:58.411
- GAUZE.
- GAUZE.

12:58.445 --> 12:59.412
- GAUZE?
- GAUZE.

12:59.446 --> 13:00.347
- GAUZE.
- GAUZE.

13:00.380 --> 13:01.414
- GAUZE.

13:01.448 --> 13:02.449
- GAUZE.
- GAUZE.

13:02.482 --> 13:04.251
- GAUZE.
- YOU KNOW WHAT?

13:04.284 --> 13:06.119
LISTEN, LISTEN, LISTEN.
IF WE DOING THIS, JOHNNY,

13:06.153 --> 13:07.420
YOU COULD CLOSE THE BACK DOORS
EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE.

13:07.454 --> 13:08.755
HOW ABOUT THAT?
- OH, GOOD ONE, HANK.

13:08.788 --> 13:09.823
- WHAT?
- MM-HMM.

13:09.857 --> 13:11.358
YEAH, WE LOAD A PATIENT IN.

13:11.391 --> 13:12.625
YOU RUN TO THE FRONT
LIKE THE BACK

13:12.659 --> 13:14.294
IS AUTOMATICALLY OUR PROBLEM.

13:14.327 --> 13:16.529
YOU COULD CLOSE THE DOORS
EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE.

13:16.563 --> 13:17.630
- BUT THAT WOULD KILL
OUR SYSTEM.

13:17.664 --> 13:18.999
I DRIVE, YOU'RE IN BACK,

13:19.032 --> 13:20.968
BRIAN'S THE BAG MAN.
- YEAH, EXACTLY.

13:21.001 --> 13:24.037
I ALWAYS CARRY THE BAGS, AND I
SIT IN THIS TINY LITTLE SEAT,

13:24.071 --> 13:25.839
IT DOESN'T EVEN
HAVE A REAL SEATBELT,

13:25.873 --> 13:27.774
AND ALL I'M ASKING FOR
IS A LITTLE MORE CONSIDERATION

13:27.807 --> 13:29.676
AND A SLIGHTLY MORE PLEASANT
TONE OF VOICE.

13:29.709 --> 13:31.344
- YOUR SEAT IS TINY.

13:31.378 --> 13:33.313
IT'S LIKE A LITTLE PERCH.

13:33.346 --> 13:36.016
LIKE BIG BIRD.

13:36.049 --> 13:37.617
BIG BIRD BRIAN.

13:37.650 --> 13:39.452
- I LIKE TO CALL
IT THE BRIAN ZONE.

13:39.486 --> 13:41.788
BUT WHEN I THINK ABOUT IT,
I'M LIKE, "SUNDAY, SUNDAY,

13:41.821 --> 13:44.958
SUNDAY, LIVE IN AMBULANCE 14,
THE BRIAN ZONE."

13:44.992 --> 13:46.126
- THE BRIAN ZONE.

13:46.159 --> 13:49.629
[air guitaring]

13:49.662 --> 13:50.663
- WHOA.

13:50.697 --> 13:54.868
[all air guitaring]

13:54.902 --> 13:57.871
- WHOA, JEEZ, HEY, LOOK AT THAT.

13:57.905 --> 14:00.740
[all air drumming violently]

14:03.410 --> 14:05.578
LIKE PHIL COLLINS DOES.

14:07.380 --> 14:08.715
I LOVE THAT.

14:08.748 --> 14:10.583
I GOT TO SAY, THOUGH.
- MM-HMM?

14:10.617 --> 14:11.351
- I'M FEELING A LITTLE BIT
OF A GONG AT THE END OF IT.

14:11.384 --> 14:13.186
- NAH.

14:18.791 --> 14:20.827
- I CANNOT BELIEVE
I MET JIMMY O.

14:20.860 --> 14:22.495
I'M STARSTRUCK,

14:22.529 --> 14:24.864
T, LIKE,
A STAR CAME OUT OF THE SKY

14:24.898 --> 14:26.666
AND HIT ME IN THE FACE.

14:26.699 --> 14:28.902
THAT'S HOW I FEEL RIGHT NOW,
MAN.

14:28.936 --> 14:31.371
- HE BOUGHT YOUR NEIGHBORHOOD
A SMALL, STUPID HORSE.

14:31.404 --> 14:32.772
BIG DEAL.

14:32.805 --> 14:34.374
- T, HOW COULD YOU EVEN SAY
THAT?

14:34.407 --> 14:35.675
HAVE YOU SEEN A HORSE?

14:35.708 --> 14:36.709
- YEAH.

14:36.743 --> 14:39.879
- THEY'RE SO MAJESTIC.

14:39.913 --> 14:42.182
I LOVE THEIR NEIGH.
IT'S SO PROUD.

14:42.215 --> 14:45.218
PLUS, THEIR HOOVES MAKE JELL-O,
WHICH IS DELICIOUS,

14:45.252 --> 14:47.454
AND GLUE, WHICH IS SUPER HELPFUL
WHEN YOU'RE,

14:47.487 --> 14:49.789
LIKE, DOING A PROJECT.

14:49.822 --> 14:51.925
- YOU KNOW THE HORSES HAVE
TO DIE TO MAKE ALL THOSE THINGS,

14:51.959 --> 14:54.761
BILLY.
- AND THAT'S REALLY SAD.

14:54.794 --> 14:56.729
BUT WHAT A WAY TO GO.

14:56.763 --> 14:59.232
AND WHEN THEY LIVE, MAN,
WHEN THEY LIVE?

14:59.266 --> 15:00.533
THEY'RE ALIVE.

15:00.567 --> 15:04.137
THE WIND
BLOWS THROUGH THEIR MANES.

15:04.171 --> 15:06.106
I WISH I HAD A MANE.

15:09.342 --> 15:12.279
- SO HE SAID HE OWED YOU, AND HE
ASKED YOU WHAT YOU WANTED,

15:12.312 --> 15:15.782
AND THE WORDS "POOL TABLE" NEVER
CAME OUT OF YOUR MOUTHS?

15:15.815 --> 15:17.084
- WELL, WE WERE GOING TO,
THOUGH WE WERE GONNA ASK

15:17.117 --> 15:18.285
FOR A PING-PONG TABLE.

15:18.318 --> 15:19.919
- PING-PONG TABLE?
- MM-HMM.

15:19.953 --> 15:21.888
- WHY DIDN'T YOU JUST ASK
FOR A CHECKER SET?

15:21.921 --> 15:24.124
PING-PONG IS NOT A MAN'S GAME.

15:24.157 --> 15:25.558
WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU?

15:25.592 --> 15:28.428
POOL TABLE, BITCHES.
BILLIARDS.

15:28.461 --> 15:30.430
I'M WORKING WITH CHILDREN, HERE.
- I LOVE PING-PONG.

15:30.463 --> 15:32.099
- YEAH, YOU KNOW WHY?
'CAUSE PING-PONG IS AWESOME.

15:32.132 --> 15:33.933
- ARE YOU GOOD, JOHNNY?
- HE THINKS HE IS.

15:33.967 --> 15:35.735
- I'M NOT SAYING I'M
THE BEST PLAYER AT THE BARBECUE,

15:35.768 --> 15:37.270
BUT I'M THE PERSON
THE BEST PLAYER WANTS TO BEAT.

15:37.304 --> 15:38.571
- SO YOU'RE SAYING
YOU'RE THE SECOND-BEST?

15:38.605 --> 15:40.240
- SECOND, THIRD,
DEPENDS ON THE BARBECUE.

15:40.273 --> 15:43.243
BUT IT DOESN'T MATTER,
BECAUSE BRIAN BLEW IT.

15:43.276 --> 15:45.912
- I SIMPLY TOLD MR. O'SHEA
THAT ALL HE OWED US

15:45.945 --> 15:49.082
WAS A PROMISE TO MAKE
A FEW CHANGES IN HIS DIET.

15:49.116 --> 15:50.984
- PING-PONG WOULD HAVE BEEN
BETTER.

15:51.018 --> 15:53.286
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT,
TRYING TO CHANGE PEOPLE, KEVIN?

15:53.320 --> 15:56.189
PEOPLE DON'T WANT TO CHANGE.
- OH, ON THE CONTRARY,

15:56.223 --> 15:59.259
THE BOYS IN AMBULANCE 14 HAVE
ALL AGREED TO MAKE SOME CHANGES.

15:59.292 --> 16:00.593
HAVEN'T WE, FELLAS?
HUH?

16:00.627 --> 16:02.095
- HEY, NO.
- DON'T TOUCH ME.

16:02.129 --> 16:04.097
- I'M SORRY.
- TERRIBLE IDEA.

16:04.131 --> 16:06.799
NEVER TRY TO CHANGE
YOUR COWORKERS.

16:06.833 --> 16:10.103
I ONCE GAVE MAC WHAT I THOUGHT
WAS CONSTRUCTIVE CRITICISM,

16:10.137 --> 16:12.039
AND MY KNEE
HASN'T BEEN THE SAME SINCE.

16:12.072 --> 16:15.442
YOU EITHER ACCEPT SOMEONE OR YOU
FIND A WAY TO GET RID OF THEM.

16:15.475 --> 16:17.010
- THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED
TO SCOTTY.

16:17.044 --> 16:19.046
- THE DUDE
WITH THE WEIRD-ASS EYES?

16:19.079 --> 16:21.714
- MM-HMM, FELT LIKE ONE EYE
WAS ALWAYS LOOKING AT MY DICK.

16:21.748 --> 16:23.350
- I DON'T KNOW, CASH,
MAYBE SOME SMALL CHANGES

16:23.383 --> 16:24.351
AROUND HERE COULD BE NICE?

16:24.384 --> 16:25.452
- THERE WE GO, PEOPLE.

16:25.485 --> 16:27.387
IT'S IN THE AIR.

16:27.420 --> 16:28.721
- YEAH, LIKE, MAYBE YOU COULD
LET US PICK THE LUNCH PLACE

16:28.755 --> 16:30.723
EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE.
- ABSOLUTELY NOT.

16:30.757 --> 16:33.793
- OR MAYBE YOU COULD START
CALLING ME BY MY REAL NAME.

16:33.826 --> 16:36.363
THAT WOULD--
THAT WOULD BE A NICE CHANGE.

16:36.396 --> 16:39.666
- OR MAYBE WE
COULD CHANGE YOUR NAME TO KEVIN.

16:39.699 --> 16:41.368
- I LIKE THAT.

16:41.401 --> 16:42.835
- I JUST THINK
WE'RE CAPABLE OF MORE, YOU KNOW?

16:42.869 --> 16:45.372
MAYBE, LIKE, FOR INSTANCE,
POLISH THUNDER.

16:45.405 --> 16:46.839
- I THINK IT'D BE
JUST EASIER TO CHANGE HIS NAME

16:46.873 --> 16:48.841
TO KEVIN, DON'T YOU?
- I THINK SO, TOO.

16:48.875 --> 16:51.010
WE'RE ON THE WAY
TO THE HOSPITAL, MA'AM.

16:51.044 --> 16:53.680
HOW IS YOUR HIP?
ARE YOU STILL IN PAIN?

16:53.713 --> 16:55.348
ARE YOU ALLERGIC TO ANYTHING?
- MM-MM.

16:55.382 --> 16:56.549
- I'M GONNA GET YOU
A LITTLE PAIN MEDICATION.

16:56.583 --> 16:58.218
YOU'LL FEEL BETTER IN NO TIME.

16:58.251 --> 17:00.353
- JOHNNY, I JUST WANT TO SAY
THAT I REALLY APPRECIATE

17:00.387 --> 17:03.022
YOU CLOSING THE DOORS THIS TIME.
- ONLY TOOK YOU THREE TRIES.

17:03.056 --> 17:04.691
- YEAH, I FORGOT THE LEFT DOOR
HAD TO CLOSE FIRST.

17:04.724 --> 17:06.193
WHY DOES IT HAVE
TO BE SO DAMN COMPLICATED?

17:06.226 --> 17:08.228
- IT'S NOT RUBIK'S CUBE, BRO.

17:10.897 --> 17:13.900
YOU FEELING BETTER, MA'AM?
- I AM.

17:13.933 --> 17:15.502
- YOU SEE THAT VOICE YOU'RE
USING WITH HER, RIGHT THERE?

17:15.535 --> 17:17.404
YOU COULD USE THAT FOR EVERYBODY
IN THIS RIG.

17:17.437 --> 17:19.739
- GAUZE.
- NO, NICER.

17:19.772 --> 17:22.109
- I'M NOT PLAYING, BRIAN.
GAUZE.

17:22.142 --> 17:24.944
- IT'S THE PITCH
IN YOUR VOICE, YOUR TONE,

17:24.977 --> 17:26.546
MAYBE IT'S YOUR FACE.

17:26.579 --> 17:28.548
- WHAT?
- IT'S MEAN.

17:28.581 --> 17:30.850
- YOU DO HAVE MEAN RESTING FACE.
YOU KNOW WHAT IT IS?

17:30.883 --> 17:32.719
IT'S A BITCH FACE.
- I DO NOT HAVE A BITCH FACE.

17:32.752 --> 17:34.454
YOU HAVE A BITCH FACE.

17:34.487 --> 17:35.888
DO YOU WANT ME TO TALK TO YOU
LIKE A LITTLE OLD LADY?

17:35.922 --> 17:38.525
FINE.
BRIAN...

17:38.558 --> 17:40.927
MAY I PLEASE HAVE SOME GAUZE?

17:40.960 --> 17:42.395
- WHY, CERTAINLY.

17:42.429 --> 17:44.931
- WHY, THANK YOU SO MUCH, BRIAN.

17:44.964 --> 17:46.566
- IT'S KIND OF CREEPY.

17:46.599 --> 17:49.102
- BRIAN, ARE THE DOORS
CLOSED ENOUGH FOR YOU?

17:49.136 --> 17:51.738
IS YOUR LITTLE BODY ABLE
TO HANDLE THE STRESS BACK THERE?

17:51.771 --> 17:53.806
- ALL RIGHT, THAT'S ENOUGH.

17:53.840 --> 17:55.975
I GET IT, I FEEL LIKE I'M
IN A HORROR MOVIE.

17:56.008 --> 17:57.877
NOT MY GENRE.
- LIKE I SAID, WE HAVE A SYSTEM.

17:57.910 --> 17:59.412
THINGS ARE THE WAY
THEY ARE FOR A REASON.

17:59.446 --> 18:00.813
- DO YOU KNOW HOW MANY PEOPLE
WOULD DIE HERE

18:00.847 --> 18:02.749
IF WE WORKED LIKE THAT?
- CHANGE KILLS, BRO.

18:02.782 --> 18:05.118
- LISTEN, I'M JUST THANKFUL THAT
YOU GUYS TRIED TO CHANGE AT ALL.

18:05.152 --> 18:06.153
- [murmuring]

18:06.186 --> 18:08.155
- WHAT WAS THAT, MA'AM?

18:08.188 --> 18:09.956
- COULD YOU TURN UP THE RADIO?

18:09.989 --> 18:12.459
I LOVE THIS TUNE.

18:12.492 --> 18:14.261
- THE RADIO'S NOT ON, MA'AM.

18:14.294 --> 18:15.595
WOULD YOU LIKE US
TO PLAY SOMETHING FOR YOU?

18:15.628 --> 18:19.299
- LET'S DANCE THE SHAG,
STRAWBERRY JAM,

18:19.332 --> 18:23.069
YOU BOYS
KNOW THAT I LOVE PENNIES?

18:23.102 --> 18:25.104
- OH, I LOVE A GOOD
OLD-FASHIONED MORPHINE RAMBLE.

18:25.138 --> 18:27.140
- IT HAS BEEN SO LONG.
- SHE'S SO CUTE.

18:27.174 --> 18:31.611
- I HID ART FOR THE NAZIS.

18:31.644 --> 18:34.847
- OKAY, SO NOW I HAVE
A NEW WORST PERSON I'VE SAVED.

18:34.881 --> 18:37.317
- NO, AARON RODGERS, BRO.

18:37.350 --> 18:39.452
- NOPE.
NO, THIS IS WORSE.

18:44.056 --> 18:48.027
[knocking]
- COME IN.

18:48.060 --> 18:51.298
- MR. O'SHEA, FAT SKINNY EDDIE,

18:51.331 --> 18:53.300
I JUST WANT TO APOLOGIZE
FOR THE OTHER DAY.

18:53.333 --> 18:54.967
I MAY HAVE BEEN TOO HARSH.

18:55.001 --> 18:56.603
I'VE BEEN TOLD
THAT I CAN BE A LITTLE ANNOYING

18:56.636 --> 18:58.305
WHEN I GET ON MY HIGH HORSE.

18:58.338 --> 18:59.772
- YOU DID WHAT I COULDN'T.

18:59.806 --> 19:01.274
- [chuckles]
OH, IT WAS NOTHING.

19:01.308 --> 19:03.343
I JUST GAVE MR. O
A DEFIBRILLATION OF TRUTH

19:03.376 --> 19:04.444
FROM THE HEART.

19:04.477 --> 19:06.012
IT'S WHAT I DO.

19:06.045 --> 19:07.480
- EDWARD, WOULD YOU GRAB ME

19:07.514 --> 19:09.349
SOME SPARKLING WATER
AND LEMON, PLEASE?

19:09.382 --> 19:11.518
- YOU GOT IT.

19:18.090 --> 19:22.729
- LOOK, I AIN'T GONNA
CHANGE, KID.

19:22.762 --> 19:24.464
BUT I WANT FAT EDDIE
TO BE HAPPY.

19:24.497 --> 19:27.834
HE DESERVES IT FOR PUTTING UP
WITH ME FOR SO LONG.

19:27.867 --> 19:33.306
I'M WILLING TO FAKE IT,
OUT OF LOVE.

19:33.340 --> 19:34.907
- HEY, BOSS,
THEY ONLY HAD STILL.

19:34.941 --> 19:37.377
- COME HERE.
[chuckles]

19:37.410 --> 19:39.379
- 25 YEARS,
I'VE NEVER GOTTEN A HUG.

19:39.412 --> 19:41.180
- THEN GET IN THIS THING.

19:41.214 --> 19:43.950
- NO, ABSOLUTELY NOT.

19:49.622 --> 19:51.924
- HEY, IS THAT FROM JIMMY O?

19:51.958 --> 19:53.192
HOW'D HE KNOW
WE WANTED ONE OF THESE THINGS?

19:53.226 --> 19:54.060
BRI, DID YOU GO TALK TO HIM
AGAIN?

19:54.093 --> 19:55.495
- I DID, BUT--

19:55.528 --> 19:56.896
- IT'S NOT FROM JIMMY O,
ASSHOLES.

19:56.929 --> 19:58.365
IT'S FROM ME.

19:58.398 --> 20:00.032
I'M NOT GONNA CHANGE
FOR ANY OF YOU,

20:00.066 --> 20:01.701
BUT I WILL BUY YOU
A PING-PONG TABLE.

20:01.734 --> 20:03.035
- OH, MAN.
- THANK YOU.

20:03.069 --> 20:04.537
- THANK YOU,
IT MEANS A LOT, CASH.

20:04.571 --> 20:07.540
- YOU'RE WELCOME, KEVIN.
GODDAMN PING-PONG.

20:07.574 --> 20:10.710
THAT BALL IS EVERYWHERE, GOING
UNDERNEATH EVERY GODDAMN THING,

20:10.743 --> 20:12.445
IMPOSSIBLE TO REACH.

20:12.479 --> 20:14.213
WON'T BE NO BALLS IN TWO DAYS.

20:14.247 --> 20:16.383
I AIN'T BUYING NEW ONES,
NOBODY WILL.

20:16.416 --> 20:18.885
THAT TABLE'S GONNA
BE A COAT RACK IN A WEEK.

20:22.322 --> 20:23.890
- LITTLE HELP?
- NO.

20:29.796 --> 20:31.063
- PONY TIME, YEAH, PONY TIME.
ALL RIGHT, PONY TIME,

20:31.097 --> 20:32.865
OKAY, PONY TIME, HEY.

20:32.899 --> 20:37.236
I SEE THE PONY.
PONY TIME, PONY--

20:37.270 --> 20:41.774
OH, MY GOD.
TONY.

20:41.808 --> 20:43.410
- WHAT UP, MAN?
- [neighs]

20:43.443 --> 20:47.447
- IT'S ME, WILLIAM.
I GO BY BILLY NOW.

20:47.480 --> 20:48.781
YOU PROBABLY DON'T RECOGNIZE ME
'CAUSE I WAS A LITTLE BIGGER

20:48.815 --> 20:50.149
WHEN I WAS A KID, THOUGH.

20:50.182 --> 20:51.918
THIS IS MY PARTNER, T.
- HI, TONY.

20:51.951 --> 20:53.953
- SHE'S HOT, RIGHT?

20:53.986 --> 20:56.556
ALL RIGHT, TONY, WE ABOUT
TO DO THIS THING, ALL RIGHT?

20:56.589 --> 20:58.891
THIS IS GONNA HAPPEN.
HERE YOU GO.

20:58.925 --> 21:00.660
THIS IS GONNA HAPPEN TODAY.
THAT'S IT.

21:00.693 --> 21:02.495
- HE LOVES IT.
- [laughs]

21:02.529 --> 21:03.630
- YEAH.
- OH.

21:03.663 --> 21:05.965
- GOOD BOY.
- TONY.

21:05.998 --> 21:08.000
- OH, YEAH.
- OH.

21:08.034 --> 21:10.670
- YEAH, SEE?
T, LOOK, I'M DOING IT.

21:10.703 --> 21:11.971
- I KNOW.
- I'M ON THE 26th STREET PONY.

21:12.004 --> 21:13.506
CAN YOU TAKE A PICTURE
REAL QUICK?

21:13.540 --> 21:14.841
- ALL RIGHT, I GOT IT.
- OF ME AND MY BOY, T?

21:14.874 --> 21:16.075
- OKAY.

21:16.108 --> 21:17.977
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.
- TONY.

21:18.010 --> 21:19.346
- TONY, LOOK AT THE CAMERA,
BABY, OH.

21:19.379 --> 21:24.016
OH!

21:24.050 --> 21:25.752
HEY, DID WE GET IT?

21:25.785 --> 21:28.421
- YEAH, I GOT IT.

21:28.455 --> 21:29.656
- NICE.
