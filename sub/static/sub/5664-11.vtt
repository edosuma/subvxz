00:00.089 --> 00:01.905
Previously on Sleepy Hollow...

00:01.906 --> 00:02.757
Lieutenant!

00:05.149 --> 00:07.098
We're not in Kansas anymore, are we?

00:07.099 --> 00:09.022
The sun has not set. It
has not moved in the sky

00:09.023 --> 00:10.735
since I arrived here. Ten months.

00:10.736 --> 00:12.470
Searching for a way out.

00:12.471 --> 00:14.029
- Abbie.
- Why wouldn't you tell me

00:14.030 --> 00:16.004
- that it was your father's place?
- I would've told you

00:16.006 --> 00:17.241
to knock on the door yourself.

00:17.242 --> 00:18.475
Supernatural creatures

00:18.476 --> 00:20.044
from all over the world are headed here.

00:20.045 --> 00:22.112
As if someone's summoning them.

00:35.860 --> 00:37.494
Pretty creepy, huh?

00:38.730 --> 00:40.064
Oh, yeah.

00:40.065 --> 00:42.366
I am shaking in my boots.

00:53.044 --> 00:54.845
Mm... okay.

00:54.846 --> 00:56.380
It's a first date.

00:56.381 --> 00:59.283
You know, so let's maybe
slow our roll a little.

00:59.284 --> 01:02.219
What's the fun in that?

01:02.220 --> 01:05.089
It's the "minding my boundaries

01:05.090 --> 01:07.091
and personal comfort" sort of fun.

01:07.092 --> 01:08.625
Come on.

01:08.626 --> 01:11.461
What'd you think we came out here to do?

01:12.931 --> 01:15.032
Wait, I'm not, I'm not kidding.

01:15.033 --> 01:17.868
Stop! What the hell are you doing?!

01:17.869 --> 01:19.403
Whatever the hell I want.

01:20.438 --> 01:22.439
Stop!

01:43.928 --> 01:45.963
You saved my life.

01:48.533 --> 01:49.933
Who are you?

01:51.402 --> 01:53.771
I have to know. Please.

01:58.510 --> 02:01.645
God, what the hell are you?

02:03.114 --> 02:04.748
No, no!

02:04.749 --> 02:06.450
No, please, no!

02:31.943 --> 02:33.744
No luck in the land of Nod?

02:33.745 --> 02:35.012
Not tonight.

02:35.013 --> 02:36.380
Or last night.

02:36.381 --> 02:39.750
I had hoped your hiatus from the FBI

02:39.751 --> 02:43.554
would help facilitate
your rest, not hinder it.

02:43.555 --> 02:44.755
Don't worry.

02:44.756 --> 02:47.658
I just getting acclimated to normal life.

02:47.659 --> 02:49.827
I didn't eat or sleep for a year.

02:49.828 --> 02:51.662
Time was a flat circle.

02:51.663 --> 02:55.766
I'm pretty sure this is just par
for the post-Catacombs course.

02:55.767 --> 02:57.901
We have not yet

02:57.902 --> 03:02.272
had an opportunity to
discuss your hardships there.

03:02.273 --> 03:05.776
And the...

03:05.777 --> 03:07.177
Please, Lieutenant.

03:08.880 --> 03:11.081
This is it.

03:11.082 --> 03:12.950
You're looking at it.

03:12.951 --> 03:14.885
Painstaking boredom.

03:16.387 --> 03:18.755
You're my Wilson.

03:21.092 --> 03:25.429
Which is why it's a little bit upsetting

03:25.430 --> 03:27.064
that you killed all my houseplants.

03:27.065 --> 03:28.065
Yes.

03:28.066 --> 03:29.533
Now, let it be known

03:29.534 --> 03:31.235
that in my time I have cultivated

03:31.236 --> 03:32.703
medicinal herb gardens,

03:32.704 --> 03:34.705
myriad vegetable patches and, in fact,

03:34.706 --> 03:37.107
once even an entire
orchard of monkey puzzle,

03:37.108 --> 03:39.376
and not one of them has been

03:39.377 --> 03:43.080
as recondite as your spiderwort variation.

03:43.081 --> 03:45.682
Two words, Crane: Miracle-Gro.

03:47.252 --> 03:50.254
In all candor, Lieutenant,

03:50.255 --> 03:52.990
whilst you were away, I
spent every waking hour

03:52.991 --> 03:54.925
endeavoring to bring you home.

03:54.926 --> 03:57.828
All other responsibilities
fell by the wayside,

03:57.829 --> 04:00.597
horticulture not excluded.

04:00.598 --> 04:02.299
That's pretty depressing.

04:02.300 --> 04:03.901
Yes.

04:03.902 --> 04:06.103
Yes, it is.

04:06.104 --> 04:07.537
Oh, I have an idea.

04:07.538 --> 04:10.407
Perhaps in a couple of hours,
we could go to the nursery

04:10.408 --> 04:12.843
and pick up some replacement greenery.

04:12.844 --> 04:15.479
Ah, and if we're brisk, we could make it

04:15.480 --> 04:19.483
to Colonial Times for
their Early Burr special.

04:19.483 --> 04:22.319
I think that I want to take a run.

04:22.320 --> 04:23.754
There's a trail I found

04:23.755 --> 04:26.056
that, uh, Jenny and I used to walk as kids.

04:26.057 --> 04:28.625
Uh, Lieutenant...

04:28.626 --> 04:32.663
I know your transition
home is a trying one.

04:32.664 --> 04:34.965
But believe me,

04:34.966 --> 04:37.267
it will grow easier.

04:37.268 --> 04:39.636
I'll see you in a couple hours.

04:39.637 --> 04:41.605
Yes.

04:53.718 --> 04:54.851
Oh.

04:54.852 --> 04:57.487
Ms. Corinth, what a pleasant surprise.

04:57.488 --> 05:00.724
Gosh, it's been, uh... heavens,

05:00.725 --> 05:02.459
a whole fortnight since last we spoke.

05:02.460 --> 05:04.861
Two and a half fortnights, actually.

05:04.862 --> 05:06.596
But who's counting?

05:07.398 --> 05:09.499
And what brings you here?

05:09.500 --> 05:11.668
Uh, we're planting merrybells

05:11.669 --> 05:14.071
for an inner-city historical restoration.

05:14.072 --> 05:15.272
- Oh.
- You?

05:15.273 --> 05:16.974
Oh, just decorating the home.

05:16.975 --> 05:19.943
I'm afraid I rather neglected
my housemate's flora,

05:19.944 --> 05:21.445
and they perished.

05:21.446 --> 05:25.749
That is what happens
when you ignore things.

05:27.452 --> 05:29.052
Miss Corinth...

05:29.053 --> 05:30.354
Zoe.

05:30.355 --> 05:33.991
Just... call me Zoe,
like a normal human being.

05:33.992 --> 05:35.192
Miss Zoe, I...

05:35.193 --> 05:36.193
Zoe.

05:36.194 --> 05:38.328
Zoe...

05:38.329 --> 05:41.999
I owe you the most profound apologies.

05:42.000 --> 05:45.268
During our courtship,
my partner went missing.

05:45.269 --> 05:47.214
Or, rather, she took a leave of absence...

05:47.215 --> 05:49.740
Look, all you needed to
do was give me a call.

05:49.741 --> 05:50.741
Send me a text.

05:50.742 --> 05:53.944
I'm a big girl. I can take it.

05:53.945 --> 05:57.014
I really didn't think you
were the ghosting type.

05:57.015 --> 05:59.983
Well, no, I try not to be.

05:59.984 --> 06:03.286
But they always seem to
find their way into my path.

06:03.287 --> 06:06.023
I have no idea what that means.

06:06.024 --> 06:07.858
I'm gonna go, okay?

06:07.859 --> 06:09.860
And if you're taking suggestions,

06:09.861 --> 06:12.396
I'd exchange those ferns for some cacti.

06:12.397 --> 06:14.798
Very low-maintenance.

06:35.520 --> 06:37.387
What?! I know exactly what you would say!

06:37.388 --> 06:39.723
- "Come now, Lieutenant."
- Just one long,

06:39.724 --> 06:44.294
endless day, hammering away
at you until you go mad.

06:52.970 --> 06:54.905
Yeah. I know.

06:54.906 --> 06:56.440
I owe you a call.

06:56.441 --> 06:59.342
Want to make it up to me?

06:59.343 --> 07:00.977
Thanks for doing this.

07:00.978 --> 07:03.613
You know I wouldn't ask you
here if it wasn't important.

07:03.614 --> 07:06.983
But three double homicides in
one week, all torn to shreds.

07:06.984 --> 07:08.118
Yeah, I'm happy to look.

07:08.119 --> 07:09.519
It's the least I can do after

07:09.520 --> 07:11.488
quitting so abruptly and leaving town.

07:11.489 --> 07:13.690
A heads-up would've been
nice. I was worried about you.

07:13.691 --> 07:17.194
Next time, I will reach out. You got a pen?

07:17.195 --> 07:19.863
Doug Frank and Krissy Kowalick,

07:19.864 --> 07:22.699
both killed and dismembered by the car.

07:22.700 --> 07:24.701
As you can see, the slashing is precise

07:24.702 --> 07:27.704
but also swift, haphazard, full of rage.

07:27.705 --> 07:30.140
It's like a crime of passion,
but that doesn't add up.

07:30.141 --> 07:31.541
Yeah, that's the weird part.

07:31.542 --> 07:34.711
The act seems personal, but
the pattern's pathological.

07:34.712 --> 07:37.080
Even with a cloudy M.O.,
the methodology's consistent:

07:37.081 --> 07:38.882
couples, at night,

07:38.883 --> 07:41.318
always these gruesome, rage-like gashes.

07:41.319 --> 07:43.253
And puncture wounds.

07:43.254 --> 07:44.421
There's two different weapons here.

07:44.422 --> 07:46.089
Yeah, but only one set of boot prints

07:46.090 --> 07:48.191
that don't match the victims.

07:48.192 --> 07:49.993
Whew. Big guy.

07:49.994 --> 07:54.197
Six-three, six-four, 240, 250 pounds.

07:54.198 --> 07:58.001
Using an Axe and a spear.

08:03.574 --> 08:06.076
You onto something?

08:06.077 --> 08:08.612
I'm sorry, Danny.

08:08.613 --> 08:09.980
I'm not ready for this.

08:09.981 --> 08:12.015
Can you put Agent Foster on it?

08:12.016 --> 08:14.618
- She's really good.
- She is, but she's not you.

08:14.619 --> 08:17.621
Well, she's the one
currently under your employ,

08:17.622 --> 08:19.923
so she'll have to suffice.

08:19.924 --> 08:21.758
I never handed in your resignation.

08:23.494 --> 08:24.828
What?

08:24.829 --> 08:27.898
What you did was rash and illegal.

08:27.899 --> 08:30.200
I wanted to give you
time to clear things up,

08:30.201 --> 08:32.469
quietly, internally.

08:32.470 --> 08:34.304
Abs, I've made mistakes in the past.

08:34.304 --> 08:35.639
I've regretted all of them.

08:35.640 --> 08:37.407
You know what I'm regretting?

08:37.408 --> 08:40.644
Coming here in the first place.

08:40.645 --> 08:43.480
Look, you know how bad
this is. I know you do.

08:43.481 --> 08:44.714
I need you here.

08:44.715 --> 08:46.783
I need time, Danny.

08:46.784 --> 08:48.752
After which, I could
begin to entertain the idea

08:48.753 --> 08:50.987
of even coming back to work.

08:50.988 --> 08:52.355
Possibly.

08:52.356 --> 08:54.024
I'm sorry.

08:57.361 --> 08:59.129
Hey.

08:59.130 --> 09:02.933
This isn't one of those
typical serial killers, is it?

09:02.934 --> 09:06.936
Meet me in the Archives in an hour.

09:15.379 --> 09:17.480
Hey. You sitting down?

09:17.481 --> 09:18.815
Oh, no.

09:18.816 --> 09:21.885
I am standing the length
of two men, Lieutenant.

09:21.886 --> 09:24.688
For I am bringing the desert climate

09:24.689 --> 09:27.490
to our Mid-Atlantic abode.

09:27.491 --> 09:30.727
It is nonsensical, it is quite unnatural,

09:30.728 --> 09:34.664
and yet, because I want it, it is so.

09:34.665 --> 09:37.367
The beauty of America.

09:37.368 --> 09:38.735
And...

09:38.736 --> 09:40.237
how was your jaunt?

09:40.238 --> 09:42.672
Interrupted. Reynolds called
me down to a crime scene.

09:42.673 --> 09:45.342
Is this the sitting down part?

09:45.343 --> 09:46.710
Yeah. There have been

09:46.711 --> 09:48.845
three double homicides in the past week.

09:48.846 --> 09:52.415
All couples, all with very
specific wound patterns:

09:52.416 --> 09:54.751
clean amputations,

09:54.752 --> 09:56.386
puncture stabs.

09:56.387 --> 09:59.022
You're describing lacerations
made by the halberd blade.

09:59.023 --> 10:00.857
And only one set of boot prints

10:00.858 --> 10:03.727
belonging to a big, hulking guy.

10:03.728 --> 10:05.862
Do you know what that means?

10:07.865 --> 10:12.068
The Kindred has returned to Sleepy Hollow.

10:36.971 --> 10:43.571
<b>Subtitle sync and corrections
by awaqeded for www.addic7ed.com.</b>

10:47.161 --> 10:49.377
The Kindred has finally heeded the call

10:49.378 --> 10:51.111
of your bounty's beacon.

10:51.112 --> 10:52.719
He is the last remnant

10:52.720 --> 10:55.722
of the dark pale rider of Death.

10:55.723 --> 10:58.992
He will be a great lieutenant
to fight by my side.

10:58.993 --> 11:01.128
Yes, we were fortunate

11:01.129 --> 11:03.430
to find the Kindred.

11:05.166 --> 11:07.801
Ignored by his tormentors

11:07.802 --> 11:10.838
and left to wander the Earth alone.

11:10.839 --> 11:13.407
I'm sure he's eager to serve.

11:13.408 --> 11:15.643
You seem sad, my beauty.

11:15.644 --> 11:17.811
Careworn.

11:17.812 --> 11:19.747
Tell me what ails you.

11:19.748 --> 11:21.615
I am not yet at full power.

11:21.616 --> 11:24.785
My bounty, it's destroyed.

11:24.786 --> 11:27.955
I, too, am disappointed
at its diminished power.

11:27.956 --> 11:31.091
Its weakened signal has
caused the Kindred's delay.

11:31.092 --> 11:32.760
But be patient.

11:32.761 --> 11:33.727
He will come.

11:33.728 --> 11:36.063
No, this is different.

11:37.599 --> 11:41.235
That box has been my sole companion

11:41.236 --> 11:43.070
for over 4,000 years.

11:43.071 --> 11:46.573
I don't know why I care so to part with it,

11:46.574 --> 11:48.776
but I do.

11:48.777 --> 11:52.646
I remember the very first
time I laid eyes upon you.

11:52.647 --> 11:57.184
Enslaved by humanity, a mute in chains.

11:57.185 --> 11:59.620
I loved you then,

11:59.621 --> 12:01.188
as I love you now.

12:01.189 --> 12:03.924
You may share the essence of humanity

12:03.925 --> 12:07.027
the mortals that surround us do...

12:08.997 --> 12:12.833
...but you are no mere mortal.

12:14.836 --> 12:17.304
Your bounty is of no consequence.

12:19.307 --> 12:21.508
So you raised a monster with the help

12:21.509 --> 12:23.210
of a witch coven and Benjamin Franklin

12:23.211 --> 12:25.346
- to defeat the Headless Horseman?
- Correct.

12:25.347 --> 12:27.548
Because the Kindred has
the Horseman of Death's head

12:27.549 --> 12:28.982
and is therefore just as powerful?

12:28.983 --> 12:31.018
Precisely.

12:31.019 --> 12:33.887
And you thought this was
a good idea because...

12:33.888 --> 12:35.856
At the time, this
Franklinstein had our backs.

12:35.857 --> 12:37.524
He was an unlucky ally

12:37.525 --> 12:38.959
in the war against evil.

12:38.960 --> 12:41.228
However, he has returned
with a wholly new purpose,

12:41.229 --> 12:43.397
the designs for which can only be explained

12:43.398 --> 12:44.398
by one cause.

12:44.399 --> 12:45.599
Pandora and the Hidden One.

12:45.600 --> 12:47.201
They've summoned him for their own devices.

12:47.202 --> 12:48.535
Okay, what can I do?

12:48.536 --> 12:49.903
Because I'm feeling useless.

12:49.904 --> 12:51.672
And if what you're saying is true,

12:51.673 --> 12:53.207
this thing won't stop killing.

12:53.208 --> 12:54.375
You can help.

12:54.376 --> 12:56.210
You can engage your
resources at the Bureau.

12:56.211 --> 12:58.779
Crane's right; we have to
attack this at every angle.

12:58.780 --> 13:00.500
You're working surveillance tonight?

13:00.501 --> 13:02.950
Can you look for locations
that fit the bill?

13:02.951 --> 13:06.286
Romantic date spots, outdoors,
little-to-no witnesses.

13:06.287 --> 13:08.655
Yeah. All right, I'll
start narrowing it down.

13:08.656 --> 13:10.324
- Thank you.
- Yep.

13:23.605 --> 13:25.472
Handwoven leather thread?

13:25.473 --> 13:28.208
Used to sew together
disparate parts of the Kindred.

13:28.209 --> 13:31.278
I bet I can guess who made this.

13:36.117 --> 13:38.852
Franklin, I will eat my
bodkin if I have to braid

13:38.853 --> 13:41.054
one more of these blasted Kindred threads.

13:41.055 --> 13:43.257
Haven't I been punished enough?

13:43.258 --> 13:44.424
Forgive me.

13:46.461 --> 13:47.861
Pardon me, I thought you were...

13:47.862 --> 13:49.797
Benjamin Franklin? No, I'm afraid not.

13:49.798 --> 13:51.865
Though I was to have an assembly with him

13:51.866 --> 13:53.434
here at a quarter past 12:00.

13:53.435 --> 13:56.203
Good luck. I've been waiting
to see him since noon.

13:56.204 --> 13:58.772
Ah.

13:58.773 --> 14:00.974
Mr. Franklin will not be coming.

14:00.975 --> 14:03.343
What makes you so certain?

14:03.344 --> 14:05.379
Given how little he leaves to chance,

14:05.380 --> 14:07.881
I'd wager this is his idiosyncratic way

14:07.882 --> 14:11.485
of introducing us as new mission partners.

14:11.486 --> 14:13.720
That's assuming you do more

14:13.721 --> 14:17.357
than mere plain-work, Miss Ross.

14:18.793 --> 14:20.828
My name is Ichabod Crane.

14:20.829 --> 14:21.790
The Oxford boy.

14:21.791 --> 14:24.225
For mercy's sake, Mr.
Crane, if I may be blunt,

14:24.226 --> 14:26.227
I have no need for a counterpart.

14:26.228 --> 14:28.596
And the last thing I
want is to be responsible

14:28.597 --> 14:30.539
for some trigger-happy revolutionary

14:30.540 --> 14:33.574
or, in your case, a rebellious bookworm.

14:33.575 --> 14:36.377
I'm quite capable, thank you.

14:37.779 --> 14:40.514
And your roster of former partners suggests

14:40.515 --> 14:42.316
I'm to be a moderating influence to you,

14:42.317 --> 14:43.985
not the other way around.

14:43.986 --> 14:46.854
The mission for tomorrow
night requires a Masonic Code.

14:46.855 --> 14:49.690
I'm quite confident that
is why you were called.

14:51.126 --> 14:53.561
Meet me outside the Ridotto
Theatre tomorrow evening.

14:53.562 --> 14:55.296
8:00.

14:55.297 --> 14:56.430
Very good.

15:00.202 --> 15:03.604
"Academiae Philadel, in Pensilvania."

15:03.605 --> 15:06.140
Now, why would Betsy Ross
have a UPenn notebook?

15:06.141 --> 15:08.342
Oh, actually, that was Franklin's.

15:08.343 --> 15:09.744
He founded the medical school,

15:09.745 --> 15:12.413
the first and only in the Colonies.

15:12.414 --> 15:14.882
Here.

15:14.883 --> 15:18.953
Franklin's notes, coded in
his own alphabet, of course.

15:18.954 --> 15:22.690
During and after the Kindred failure,

15:22.691 --> 15:25.793
Franklin experimented
with Kindred proxies...

15:25.794 --> 15:28.763
undead creations of bricolage soldiers

15:28.764 --> 15:30.131
that he brought to life

15:30.132 --> 15:32.600
without the Kindred's immortality.

15:32.601 --> 15:36.370
He wanted to study these beasts, so if he

15:36.371 --> 15:39.006
ever found a piece of Death
that would allow him to raise

15:39.007 --> 15:41.575
the formidable Kindred,
he'd know how to control it.

15:41.576 --> 15:44.078
Alas, this yielded no results.

15:44.079 --> 15:46.347
Mm.

15:46.348 --> 15:49.250
Or maybe he just

15:49.251 --> 15:51.385
hid it very carefully.

15:51.386 --> 15:54.322
Those are his results.

15:54.323 --> 15:57.024
- Yeah.
- Oh, Lieutenant.

15:57.025 --> 16:01.595
"Moderating Influences for Kindred Proxies.

16:01.596 --> 16:05.032
"First, the Kindred is a creature of habit.

16:05.033 --> 16:06.701
"When left alone, Kindred proxies

16:06.702 --> 16:08.602
return to familiar places...

16:08.603 --> 16:11.372
"burial sites, resurrection localities.

16:11.373 --> 16:12.807
- Sec..."
- "Second,

16:12.808 --> 16:14.759
"the Kindred can be soothed, even guided by

16:14.760 --> 16:16.427
"calming vibrations,

16:16.428 --> 16:20.098
most effectively transmitted
through a glass harmonica."

16:20.099 --> 16:22.533
Right. When did you learn to read Franklin?

16:22.534 --> 16:23.776
You were abroad

16:23.777 --> 16:25.411
for a year, and I got bored.

16:25.412 --> 16:26.846
What's this glass harmonica thing?

16:26.847 --> 16:32.818
An instrument Franklin invented
for parties, festivities...

16:32.819 --> 16:36.556
and, evidently, Kindred lullabies.

16:36.557 --> 16:38.491
We can get Jenny and Joe on it,

16:38.492 --> 16:40.326
see if they can track down

16:40.327 --> 16:42.728
Franklin's glass harmonica,

16:42.729 --> 16:45.097
use it to draw the Kindred into some...

16:45.098 --> 16:46.432
TBD death trap.

16:46.433 --> 16:48.601
And in the meantime, you and I shall see

16:48.602 --> 16:50.803
if our creature of habit
has visited his burial site

16:50.804 --> 16:52.939
in the depths of the tunnels.

16:52.940 --> 16:54.740
Hell yeah.

17:23.569 --> 17:25.905
Uh, do you have light?

17:33.347 --> 17:35.915
- Jen.
- Huh?

17:36.779 --> 17:38.380
This is your dad's lighter.

17:38.381 --> 17:39.413
So what?

17:39.414 --> 17:40.915
So it's weird enough

17:40.916 --> 17:42.683
that we stole this from
him in the first place,

17:42.684 --> 17:44.418
not to mention the fact that

17:44.419 --> 17:46.453
you're carrying around
a Zippo from the '90s

17:46.454 --> 17:48.789
when you got a flashlight on your phone.

17:51.393 --> 17:52.826
We steal stuff all the time.

17:52.827 --> 17:54.728
We're stealing stuff right now.

17:54.729 --> 17:57.064
Ezra was just another guy who
had something that we needed,

17:57.065 --> 17:59.200
and you're right, we don't need it anymore.

17:59.201 --> 18:00.367
So, do you mind?

18:00.368 --> 18:02.436
- Okay. Okay.
- Awesome.

18:02.437 --> 18:04.938
All right, got it?

18:19.721 --> 18:21.455
Walking and texting?

18:21.456 --> 18:23.490
You have officially assimilated.

18:23.491 --> 18:25.726
Ah. 'Tis Ms. Corinth.

18:25.727 --> 18:27.795
She wishes to meet up
so she can recover a book

18:27.796 --> 18:29.050
that she allowed me to borrow.

18:29.051 --> 18:31.065
Which is a very good sign, is it not?

18:31.066 --> 18:32.967
It isn't, actually.

18:32.968 --> 18:34.368
It's a bad sign.

18:34.369 --> 18:36.704
Crane, you have every book imaginable.

18:36.705 --> 18:40.708
If she lent you something,
it was to bond with you.

18:40.709 --> 18:42.376
And now she wants it back

18:42.377 --> 18:44.845
because I've spoiled what bond we had.

18:44.846 --> 18:45.946
Mm.

18:49.951 --> 18:52.286
I was very fond of her, Lieutenant.

18:52.287 --> 18:54.955
I know you were. Just bad timing.

18:57.525 --> 18:59.760
He's been here, all right.

19:07.568 --> 19:10.702
A lot of killers collect
items from their victims

19:10.703 --> 19:13.106
to try to stay connected to them.

19:13.107 --> 19:14.841
But this... oh...

19:14.842 --> 19:18.177
feels different, like he's
trying to understand something.

19:20.614 --> 19:22.315
Lieutenant.

19:26.052 --> 19:28.854
Since when does the Kindred write?

19:28.855 --> 19:31.156
Since when does he care to?

19:33.909 --> 19:36.912
Franklin's list of moderating influences.

19:36.913 --> 19:39.387
A creature of habit who
returns to his origins...

19:39.388 --> 19:40.082
that means home.

19:40.083 --> 19:41.984
Vibrations from a glass harmonica...

19:41.985 --> 19:44.853
- that can only mean...
- Music, relaxation therapy.

19:44.854 --> 19:49.024
These are moderating influences
for people, not monsters.

19:49.025 --> 19:51.493
And the rage behind the killings.

19:51.494 --> 19:53.629
The anger, the pain,

19:53.630 --> 19:55.397
longing, emotions.

19:55.398 --> 19:57.399
The Kindred isn't just turning evil.

19:58.701 --> 20:00.802
He's turning human.

20:25.395 --> 20:27.295
No!

20:38.808 --> 20:41.176
Come on, come on.

21:07.678 --> 21:09.920
Hey... good call, Mills.

21:10.359 --> 21:12.133
Geographical monster profiling

21:12.133 --> 21:14.234
set me on the right trail at the park.

21:14.235 --> 21:16.035
I see why Reynolds can't let you go.

21:16.036 --> 21:17.377
Well, he might feel differently if he knew

21:17.377 --> 21:19.077
that I'd created a monster.

21:19.078 --> 21:20.511
Human.

21:20.512 --> 21:22.480
According to Franklin's

21:22.481 --> 21:24.282
uncharacteristically vague notes,

21:24.283 --> 21:26.918
these creations, over time, develop

21:26.919 --> 21:31.455
unique human traits, personality, emotions.

21:31.456 --> 21:34.158
We believe the Kindred is killing couples

21:34.159 --> 21:36.394
because he's envious of the love

21:36.395 --> 21:37.995
and connection that he cannot have.

21:37.996 --> 21:39.005
Problem now

21:39.006 --> 21:40.998
is that even if we had
a way of killing him...

21:40.999 --> 21:44.602
We cannot simply destroy
a semi-conscious being.

21:45.837 --> 21:50.041
We raised the Kindred in the
absence of decency and morals.

21:50.042 --> 21:51.275
'Tis our responsibility

21:51.276 --> 21:52.577
to end this humanely.

21:52.578 --> 21:54.579
I get that you guys feel guilty,

21:54.580 --> 21:57.582
but whether this is a monster, a human

21:57.583 --> 22:00.685
or something in between, it
is killing innocent people.

22:00.686 --> 22:02.420
We got to get a hold on it.

22:02.421 --> 22:03.654
The Masonic Cell.

22:03.655 --> 22:05.323
It worked for the Horseman of Death.

22:05.324 --> 22:07.858
We can use the glass harmonica
to draw the Kindred inside.

22:07.859 --> 22:11.028
One of Franklin's more obnoxious
hobbies was rewriting the lyrics

22:11.029 --> 22:14.465
of beloved songs to show how
they'd hindered the melody.

22:14.466 --> 22:17.034
To illustrate his point,

22:17.035 --> 22:19.437
he composed a variation
of the Charles Wesley hymn,

22:19.438 --> 22:21.238
"Come, Thou Almighty King."

22:23.675 --> 22:26.143
"Come, Thou Almighty Kin."

22:26.144 --> 22:28.079
As in "Kindred."

22:29.548 --> 22:31.549
This is the summoning tune.

22:35.554 --> 22:37.722
Look, I am just saying,

22:37.723 --> 22:39.790
grabbing a cup of coffee with the guy

22:39.791 --> 22:41.859
wouldn't be the end of the world.

22:41.860 --> 22:44.562
I don't want to have a
latte with my deadbeat dad.

22:44.563 --> 22:46.097
Why are you fixating on this?

22:47.366 --> 22:49.533
Because I did the exact same thing.

22:49.534 --> 22:51.936
The whole week before I deployed,

22:51.937 --> 22:54.672
I was crashing on a friend's couch,

22:54.673 --> 22:58.109
and I timed it so that I
went home and packed my bag

22:58.110 --> 22:59.644
when my dad was out on duty.

22:59.645 --> 23:02.480
I mean, do you know what I'd give

23:02.481 --> 23:05.916
to see him, talk to him,
even, like, for a second?

23:05.917 --> 23:09.220
Just about anything in the world.

23:09.221 --> 23:10.988
- I'm sorry, Joe.
- No, no.

23:10.989 --> 23:12.690
I don't... I don't want you to be sorry.

23:12.691 --> 23:15.326
I just... want you to,
like, put your ego aside

23:15.327 --> 23:17.561
for half a second and talk to the guy.

23:17.562 --> 23:21.265
We went through this already.

23:21.266 --> 23:22.667
Abbie doesn't want to talk to him.

23:22.668 --> 23:25.036
Oh, Jen, I mean, you can't
use Abbie as an excuse

23:25.037 --> 23:27.138
not to have a relationship
with your father.

23:27.139 --> 23:30.741
This is your life.

23:30.742 --> 23:34.545
You got to live it for yourself.

23:34.546 --> 23:37.148
Let's give this thing a whirl.

23:37.149 --> 23:39.784
All right.

23:49.127 --> 23:50.461
Yeah.

23:50.462 --> 23:51.862
Six years of piano lessons.

23:51.863 --> 23:53.631
I could've been shredding
on a glass harmonica.

23:53.632 --> 23:55.399
Missed opportunity.

23:55.400 --> 23:56.967
Hey, Crane?

23:56.968 --> 24:00.237
We need the sheet music
for the summoning tune.

24:00.238 --> 24:03.474
Oh, zounds.

24:03.475 --> 24:05.276
'Tis in the Archives.

24:06.178 --> 24:08.946
I shall have it in a
shaking of a lamb's tail.

24:11.416 --> 24:15.419
Well done, Professor Crane, you fool.

24:21.393 --> 24:23.260
- Zoe.
- Hi.

24:23.261 --> 24:24.528
Good evening.

24:24.529 --> 24:27.732
Uh... what are you doing here?

24:27.733 --> 24:29.967
Uh, figuring out a time
to meet was becoming

24:29.968 --> 24:31.902
more of a production
than the meeting itself,

24:31.903 --> 24:35.973
so I thought I'd just swing by and grab it.

24:35.974 --> 24:38.609
My book?

24:38.610 --> 24:42.246
Your book. Of course. Uh...

24:42.247 --> 24:43.647
What was it called again?

24:43.648 --> 24:46.250
A People's History by Howard Zinn?

24:46.251 --> 24:47.251
Of course it was.

24:47.252 --> 24:50.020
Um... right.

24:50.021 --> 24:55.192
I... don't know exactly
where your book is... exactly,

24:55.193 --> 24:57.695
and, uh, the long and short of it is,

24:57.696 --> 24:59.330
I'm a little preoccupied at the moment.

24:59.331 --> 25:00.898
With what?

25:00.899 --> 25:04.068
You're alone in the Archives,
literally doing nothing.

25:04.069 --> 25:07.304
Yes, I can understand why
you would think that, but I...

25:09.274 --> 25:12.243
Zoe, I am, uh...

25:13.712 --> 25:15.946
It's very difficult to explain.

25:15.947 --> 25:18.416
Can you just tell me what it is?

25:18.417 --> 25:20.418
Do you have a wife or a secret family?

25:20.419 --> 25:22.153
Are you, like, a drug addict?

25:22.154 --> 25:24.421
No, I...

25:35.333 --> 25:37.768
Oh, Joe, he's coming out.

25:50.715 --> 25:53.184
Come on, just try something.

26:34.659 --> 26:37.495
It's working.

27:02.587 --> 27:04.154
What's happening? Why'd he stop?

27:07.125 --> 27:08.826
Okay.

27:11.563 --> 27:12.930
What the hell is he doing?

27:12.931 --> 27:14.665
It's not the right music.

27:14.666 --> 27:16.534
- Didn't keep his attention.
- It's more than that.

27:16.535 --> 27:18.435
He's following something.

27:26.545 --> 27:28.879
Where'd he go?

27:35.987 --> 27:37.955
I get it now.

27:37.956 --> 27:40.524
This is not just about envy and punishment.

27:40.525 --> 27:42.359
He's looking for connection.

27:42.360 --> 27:43.928
He wants a wife.

27:43.929 --> 27:46.130
I told my family about you.

27:46.131 --> 27:49.408
I asked my brother-in-law to
help you with your immigration.

27:49.409 --> 27:51.635
Which was an unbelievably
kind, and I'm very grateful.

27:51.636 --> 27:53.370
No, it was foolish!

27:53.371 --> 27:56.707
Because none of this mattered
to you, none of it was real.

27:56.708 --> 27:58.842
It was just something I made up in my head,

27:58.843 --> 28:01.545
that we had this... special connection,

28:01.546 --> 28:03.881
and obviously we didn't.

28:04.649 --> 28:06.383
Look,

28:06.384 --> 28:07.418
forget it.

28:07.419 --> 28:08.852
I'm gonna go.

28:35.280 --> 28:37.615
Mine.

28:37.616 --> 28:41.318
You follow, she dies.

28:48.805 --> 28:51.041
Normally, he would take
a hostage to the tunnels.

28:51.042 --> 28:54.095
- But, that location has been compromised.
- Well, why the sudden change in M.O.?

28:54.096 --> 28:56.716
He's been killing victims,
not kidnapping them.

28:56.717 --> 28:57.553
He's sick of waiting.

28:57.554 --> 28:59.777
He wants a bride, and he wants one now.

29:01.789 --> 29:03.309
The Carriage House.

29:04.045 --> 29:05.745
The Kindred has been there before.

29:05.746 --> 29:08.863
It's where the Headless Horseman
tried to keep his own bride.

29:08.864 --> 29:11.498
I will text you the address,
we'll meet you there.

29:11.499 --> 29:13.333
And do what?

29:13.334 --> 29:15.969
The Kindred has Zoe, we have
no way of controlling him,

29:15.970 --> 29:18.638
and it's entirely my fault.

29:18.639 --> 29:20.107
I brought the Kindred into this world

29:20.108 --> 29:21.842
with the same thoughtless inelegance

29:21.843 --> 29:25.746
with which I dismissed
poor Zoe, ghosted upon her.

29:25.747 --> 29:27.848
If he harms her in any way...

29:27.849 --> 29:29.216
Crane, the Kindred does
not want to harm Zoe.

29:29.217 --> 29:30.984
He wants to hurt you,
which is a good thing.

29:30.985 --> 29:33.520
He's getting joy from your suffering,

29:33.521 --> 29:35.122
which buys us some time.

29:35.123 --> 29:37.290
I know you're worried about
her, but we'll get her back.

29:37.291 --> 29:38.925
Right.

29:38.926 --> 29:40.293
But how?

29:40.294 --> 29:44.398
For all Franklin's experiments,
these books offer nothing

29:44.399 --> 29:45.499
of any practical use.

29:45.500 --> 29:46.900
Wait, wait. Hold on. Hold on.

29:46.901 --> 29:48.835
University of Pennsylvania? That...

29:48.836 --> 29:52.039
It's almost like the insignia
we saw at the opera house.

29:52.040 --> 29:54.574
- What opera house?
- The Jersey Opera House,

29:54.575 --> 29:57.179
where we stole Franklin's
harmonica. We got lucky.

29:57.180 --> 29:58.945
It was a place he used to
patron back in your day,

29:58.946 --> 30:00.647
but it was called something else then.

30:00.648 --> 30:02.682
The Ridotto Theatre. Yes, I know it well.

30:02.683 --> 30:04.317
Wait. So you know the insignia?

30:04.318 --> 30:06.186
It's on a weird door?

30:06.187 --> 30:07.854
Indeed.

30:07.855 --> 30:11.491
Franklin tasked Betsy and me
with hiding medical supplies.

30:11.492 --> 30:13.426
It was our first mission.

30:17.065 --> 30:19.266
Do you know what time they lock the doors?

30:19.267 --> 30:20.734
6:30. You should make haste.

30:20.735 --> 30:22.903
The "Venere Bella" aria is about to begin.

30:22.904 --> 30:25.739
Wouldn't miss it for world.

30:30.978 --> 30:34.548
Oh, nice. We're both an hour ahead of form.

30:34.549 --> 30:36.616
Did you know they lock the doors at 6:30?

30:36.617 --> 30:37.951
I did not know that.

30:37.952 --> 30:39.817
Nor that you were a patron of the opera.

30:39.818 --> 30:42.285
Oh, at Oxford, I lived and breathed it.

30:42.286 --> 30:45.255
Mr. Crane, I hope you don't take
all of this confusion to mean

30:45.256 --> 30:47.524
I was intentionally trying to mislead you.

30:47.525 --> 30:50.894
My dear Miss Ross, you
tried to lock me out,

30:50.895 --> 30:52.729
and then you left the performance

30:52.730 --> 30:54.932
immediately before "Venere Bella,"

30:54.933 --> 30:58.102
Cleopatra's lengthy and
highly-anticipated aria.

30:58.103 --> 31:00.337
You did this so you could acquire

31:00.338 --> 31:03.974
the greatest margin of time
to execute our mission alone.

31:03.975 --> 31:06.276
I know you were trying to mislead me.

31:06.277 --> 31:08.778
But you're going to have
to do better than that.

31:08.779 --> 31:12.082
Come along. I've already
brought in the supplies.

31:23.361 --> 31:25.528
How's that for a rebellious bookworm?

31:25.529 --> 31:28.231
You'll do, I suppose.

31:28.232 --> 31:30.166
Now, let's see to the storage

31:30.167 --> 31:32.969
of Franklin's so-called
moderating influence.

31:36.874 --> 31:39.042
The medical supplies I
believed we were hiding

31:39.043 --> 31:41.111
from the British... they were a cover.

31:41.112 --> 31:42.779
The entire medical school

31:42.780 --> 31:44.914
was a cover for Franklin's
Kindred experiments.

31:44.915 --> 31:48.184
Now, this insignia symbolizes the Kindred,

31:48.185 --> 31:52.055
but also the Kindred's ultimate fail-safe.

31:52.056 --> 31:56.326
His one true moderating influence.

31:58.295 --> 31:59.763
That's the insignia we saw.

31:59.764 --> 32:01.231
With the cross at the bottom.

32:01.232 --> 32:02.532
The Venus symbol.

32:02.533 --> 32:04.534
Are you telling me that Benjamin Franklin

32:04.535 --> 32:06.269
actually built a female for the Kindred?

32:06.270 --> 32:08.471
Considering how little
Franklin leaves to chance,

32:08.472 --> 32:10.707
I would rely upon it.

32:20.284 --> 32:23.620
They're in the barn
behind the Carriage House.

32:25.956 --> 32:29.426
Looks like he is ready to
snap. Where are you guys?

32:29.427 --> 32:30.960
We took a slight detour.

32:44.108 --> 32:46.309
Behold...

32:46.310 --> 32:48.945
the Kindress.

33:47.562 --> 33:49.129
And that's off the bucket list.

33:56.271 --> 33:57.838
She's in here!

34:11.319 --> 34:13.520
_

34:14.322 --> 34:18.351
_

34:18.690 --> 34:19.690
_

36:35.229 --> 36:37.898
Well...

36:37.899 --> 36:39.733
that was odd.

36:47.592 --> 36:49.656
You never got a good
look at him at any point?

36:49.657 --> 36:52.083
He was horribly disfigured.

36:52.908 --> 36:54.575
Didn't say much.

36:54.576 --> 36:57.978
I'm sorry. I-I wish I could tell you more.

36:57.979 --> 37:01.048
I know what you're thinking.

37:01.049 --> 37:02.983
Mills would've caught him alive.

37:05.687 --> 37:08.489
She's a damn good agent, Reynolds.

37:08.490 --> 37:11.192
You should talk to her again

37:11.193 --> 37:14.061
and tell her how important she is to you.

37:21.403 --> 37:23.671
Zoe?

37:23.672 --> 37:25.306
Oh.

37:25.307 --> 37:27.074
For you.

37:27.075 --> 37:29.460
- Did you like it?
- I did. Very much.

37:29.461 --> 37:31.028
Thank you.

37:31.029 --> 37:33.515
Would it be foolish of
me to ask how you fare?

37:33.516 --> 37:36.302
It's all a little overwhelming.

37:36.303 --> 37:37.213
Of course.

37:37.214 --> 37:39.252
Honestly, I'm just happy to be alive.

37:39.253 --> 37:40.619
Zoe, I am sorry.

37:40.620 --> 37:42.653
For all of this.

37:42.654 --> 37:44.490
You really don't need to do this.

37:44.491 --> 37:46.591
No, no, please.

37:46.592 --> 37:48.926
My negligence has been appalling.

37:48.927 --> 37:53.131
I hope you know I care for you very deeply,

37:53.132 --> 37:57.502
and I would stand so lucky
to be with a woman of your...

37:57.503 --> 38:01.272
beauty and character.

38:01.273 --> 38:03.908
I only wish I were ready

38:03.909 --> 38:06.177
for a commitment of that caliber.

38:06.178 --> 38:08.112
Truthfully, Ichabod,

38:08.113 --> 38:12.917
I think you are ready for someone.

38:12.918 --> 38:15.420
I just don't think it's me.

38:15.421 --> 38:17.288
And that's okay.

38:26.098 --> 38:28.666
Miss Corinth.

38:28.667 --> 38:31.936
Farewell, Mr. Crane.

38:38.177 --> 38:40.211
Five minutes. That's all I need.

38:45.584 --> 38:47.852
So...

38:47.853 --> 38:49.620
what's going on, Danny?

38:49.621 --> 38:52.390
You know why I fell in love
with you back when we were

38:52.391 --> 38:53.691
new agents in training?

38:53.692 --> 38:57.395
You were smarter, you worked harder,

38:57.396 --> 38:58.696
smelled better.

38:58.697 --> 39:00.565
You made me push myself.

39:00.566 --> 39:02.467
Made me a better man.

39:02.468 --> 39:07.104
But, lately, I don't recognize that man.

39:07.105 --> 39:10.641
I guess what I'm saying is
you're a damn good agent,

39:10.642 --> 39:12.143
and the Bureau's gonna feel your loss,

39:12.144 --> 39:15.746
but we're gonna have to learn
how to get on without you.

39:15.747 --> 39:17.982
Abbie Mills deserves better.

39:21.687 --> 39:23.988
You love me?

39:23.989 --> 39:25.923
You never said that before.

39:25.924 --> 39:28.125
I didn't have to.

39:29.161 --> 39:32.129
I care about you, Abs... always will.

39:32.130 --> 39:35.032
And I just want you to be happy.

39:35.033 --> 39:37.635
I want to apologize

39:37.636 --> 39:39.670
for the way that I left.

39:39.671 --> 39:40.972
And I'll come back to work.

39:40.973 --> 39:42.640
Y-You know, I want to come back to work,

39:42.641 --> 39:44.275
and I need to come back to work.

39:45.410 --> 39:46.811
And I'm ready now.

39:46.812 --> 39:49.514
So, thank you.

39:49.515 --> 39:52.917
See you Monday.

40:00.125 --> 40:02.827
The Kindred will be here momentarily,

40:02.828 --> 40:06.864
and with his arrival comes a new beginning.

40:06.865 --> 40:11.068
Soon, an entire army will
follow under his lead,

40:11.069 --> 40:13.504
all to serve at my behest.

40:13.505 --> 40:15.373
Yes, my love.

40:15.374 --> 40:19.343
And they will be lucky to serve you.

40:19.344 --> 40:20.878
As am I.

40:20.879 --> 40:24.048
Still, I...

40:24.049 --> 40:26.217
think I would be more
effective in my service

40:26.218 --> 40:29.120
if my powers were restored.

40:29.121 --> 40:33.758
That way we could serve each other.

40:33.759 --> 40:36.193
Rule as one.

40:37.629 --> 40:39.430
What say you, my love?

40:39.431 --> 40:42.900
The Kindred... he is
departing Sleepy Hollow.

40:42.901 --> 40:44.602
For what cause?

40:53.879 --> 40:56.614
My most valuable lieutenant

40:56.615 --> 40:57.982
has abandoned his post.

40:57.983 --> 40:59.150
For what?!

40:59.151 --> 41:03.054
Love? This weakness?!

41:09.227 --> 41:12.163
I will not allow my power to be diluted

41:12.164 --> 41:14.966
by unnecessary partnerships.

41:14.967 --> 41:17.234
These trivial

41:17.235 --> 41:19.036
human urges.

41:20.038 --> 41:23.407
I will not allow weakness.

41:31.783 --> 41:34.118
Right. Um...

41:34.119 --> 41:36.654
What is this, amateur hour?

41:36.655 --> 41:39.123
Oh.

41:39.124 --> 41:40.257
Yes.

41:40.258 --> 41:44.061
This is not the game I promised, is it?

41:44.062 --> 41:47.398
I'm afraid my mind remains...

41:47.399 --> 41:49.567
elsewhere.

41:49.568 --> 41:51.168
Mine, too.

41:51.169 --> 41:54.839
It's been a lot to process lately.

41:54.840 --> 41:57.174
But it is nice to be home.

42:01.880 --> 42:03.648
Speaking of home,

42:03.649 --> 42:06.817
is this new Tex-Mex decor
really our new normal?

42:06.818 --> 42:08.686
Yes. We're a succulent family now.

42:08.687 --> 42:09.620
Mm-hmm.

42:09.621 --> 42:10.788
Ah!

42:12.124 --> 42:13.557
- Oh, heavens, you're bleeding.
- Mm-hmm.

42:13.558 --> 42:16.994
I'll fetch a bandage from
the apothecary drawer.

42:16.995 --> 42:18.663
Oh, and no cheating.

42:18.664 --> 42:21.532
- Please. Please.
- "Please."

42:21.533 --> 42:22.967
"Please."

42:45.924 --> 42:47.758
Right.

42:47.759 --> 42:49.760
Here.

42:49.761 --> 42:52.263
Finger. Oh. Thank you.

42:54.900 --> 42:56.934
You're up.

42:56.935 --> 42:58.803
Oh, well, finally.
