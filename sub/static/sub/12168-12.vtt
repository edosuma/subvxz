00:08.600 --> 00:11.000
Why do you have to park so far away?

00:11.040 --> 00:13.200
This ridge was a little further away than it looked.

00:13.240 --> 00:15.400
You can't just land a Jumper anywhere, Rodney.

00:15.440 --> 00:17.640
It doesn't matter now, I think we're almost there.

00:17.680 --> 00:20.560
Rodney, do you even know what it is we are looking for?

00:20.600 --> 00:22.760
Yeah, well, whatever it is, it's around here somewhere.

00:22.800 --> 00:23.760
What's around here?

00:23.800 --> 00:27.160
Whatever it was that was causing the energy spike
we detected from the Puddle Jumper.

00:27.200 --> 00:28.400
D'you have any idea what that looks like?

00:28.440 --> 00:30.400
I'll know it when I see it...

00:32.400 --> 00:33.400
And I see it.

00:39.600 --> 00:40.600
Looks like a door.

00:41.000 --> 00:43.000
Yes, it is remarkably door-like

00:48.200 --> 00:52.600
Well, looks like the only way through the ridge anyway.
It runs for miles.

00:53.400 --> 00:54.760
Alright, let's check it out.

00:54.920 --> 00:56.600
- There's something there.
- What?

00:56.640 --> 00:59.000
Some kind of an energy barrier
around the threshold.

01:11.000 --> 01:12.160
It disappeared.

01:12.200 --> 01:13.800
Or it went right through a cloak.

01:13.840 --> 01:15.800
It has many of the same properties
as a cloaking field.

01:15.840 --> 01:18.200
Yeah, and the Ancients did tend
to hide all the really cool stuff.

01:18.240 --> 01:21.200
Yeah, I would just like to be able to explain
these readings better before we step through.

01:23.800 --> 01:25.000
Get me a branch.

01:25.040 --> 01:26.400
You got tape?

01:29.000 --> 01:30.000
<i>Because...</i>

01:32.200 --> 01:33.200
I got a camera!

01:34.200 --> 01:35.600
I didn't ask for a log!

01:37.200 --> 01:38.200
<i>Thank you!</i>

01:38.400 --> 01:39.600
OK, so...

01:41.000 --> 01:42.400
Tape it to the stick...

01:46.000 --> 01:47.000
We extend the camera through,

01:47.040 --> 01:50.600
record for a few minutes,
pull it back, play the recorder.

01:52.000 --> 01:53.800
Yeah! MALP on a stick!

01:54.400 --> 01:57.000
Yes, MALP on a stick, very clever.

01:58.400 --> 01:59.360
<i>Are we done?</i>

01:59.600 --> 02:00.440
Yep!

02:18.400 --> 02:21.960
<i>I am not fluent in Ancient
but I do recognise a few words.</i>

02:22.000 --> 02:24.800
'Welcome' and 'ascension'.

02:25.240 --> 02:25.960
Ascension?

02:26.000 --> 02:28.200
<i>To a higher plane of existence.</i>

02:28.240 --> 02:30.400
<i>The race of people who built the Stargate,</i>

02:30.440 --> 02:35.800
they eventually evolved to a point
where they ascended to a state of pure energy.

02:36.600 --> 02:37.600
That'd be great!

02:37.640 --> 02:40.600
Yeah, well, sadly it's a matter of... evolution.

02:43.000 --> 02:43.800
Anyway...

02:43.840 --> 02:45.600
I'm sure we've got more than enough now.

02:46.200 --> 02:47.600
There we go.

02:48.000 --> 02:49.000
And...

02:50.000 --> 02:51.400
have a look, shall we?

02:59.600 --> 03:02.000
OK, then! Any volunteers?

03:02.400 --> 03:03.400
I'll go.

03:06.000 --> 03:08.960
Just... back out if you encounter
anything problematic.

03:09.000 --> 03:09.800
Problematic?

03:09.840 --> 03:13.000
Yeah, like poisonous atmosphere,
acid atmosphere, no atmosphere.

03:13.040 --> 03:15.000
Hey, it's a MALP on a stick, only shows you so much.

03:17.200 --> 03:18.000
OK.

03:20.600 --> 03:21.600
Here goes.

03:28.800 --> 03:29.800
Weird!

03:30.401 --> 03:32.101
What is wrong?

03:32.400 --> 03:34.000
Yeah, it's kinda hurting my hands a little.

03:34.040 --> 03:35.400
OK, so get outta there.

03:35.440 --> 03:38.200
I'm trying to, but it's pulling me in.

03:38.400 --> 03:39.400
I got you.

03:40.200 --> 03:41.800
OK, come on, guys, get me outta here.

03:41.840 --> 03:42.800
I'm tryin'.

03:42.840 --> 03:44.000
Well, try harder.

03:44.040 --> 03:45.400
No, we proved this it shouldn't be happening.

03:45.440 --> 03:48.400
Well, it is!
It's pulling me in!

03:48.440 --> 03:50.000
It's too strong!

03:52.400 --> 03:53.800
Don't touch the barrier!

05:11.800 --> 05:14.400
I don't know if you can hear me over the radio, but...

05:14.440 --> 05:18.000
I'm finally on the other side.

05:19.200 --> 05:21.200
Looks just like the pictures.

05:26.200 --> 05:28.200
Hurts pretty bad to move.

05:29.200 --> 05:30.400
I don't know if I can...

05:34.400 --> 05:38.000
Alright, you guys... stay put.

05:43.800 --> 05:45.200
Why did you tell us to let him go?

05:45.240 --> 05:48.000
Because you weren't gonna stop and the last thing
we need is both of you to get pulled in with him.

05:48.040 --> 05:50.000
Why would the Ancestors create
something that would do this?

05:50.040 --> 05:51.000
I don't know.

05:51.040 --> 05:53.600
- Figure it out or you're going in after him!
- OK, that is not helping!

05:53.640 --> 05:56.800
Obviously the portal reacts differently to living
matter than it does to inanimate objects.

05:56.840 --> 05:58.120
It might even be specific to humans.

05:58.440 --> 06:00.200
This is Sheppard, can you hear me now?

06:04.800 --> 06:06.400
I've taken a good look around the area.

06:07.400 --> 06:09.400
Cave opens up to the other side of the ridge.

06:10.200 --> 06:12.000
There's not much there, so...

06:14.000 --> 06:15.000
I'm just gonna...

06:16.000 --> 06:17.000
wait here...

06:18.000 --> 06:20.400
and give you guys a chance to figure this one out.

06:21.800 --> 06:24.400
Colonel Sheppard, this is Teyla.
Please respond.

06:24.440 --> 06:26.600
You're wasting your time and it's not gonna work.

06:27.400 --> 06:29.200
Colonel, if you can hear me, please respond.

06:32.400 --> 06:36.200
There's absolutely nothing on this tape
that could possibly indicate any kind...

06:36.600 --> 06:37.440
Oh, no!

06:38.200 --> 06:39.000
What?

06:39.800 --> 06:41.000
The memory's full.

06:41.600 --> 06:43.600
It's recorded almost two hours and...

06:43.640 --> 06:45.560
and the battery just died! Dammit!

06:45.600 --> 06:46.560
Why are you wasting time?

06:46.600 --> 06:48.400
That is the one thing I am not doing.
OK, look,

06:48.440 --> 06:52.400
I need something living, like a,
like a flower, or a blossom. OK.

06:53.600 --> 06:57.400
Now would not be a good time to throw that rock
I asked you to throw a few hours ago.

06:58.200 --> 07:01.400
I'd never see it coming,
this side is as black as oil.

07:12.800 --> 07:17.000
There's one thing I haven't tried,
so if you can hear me... stand back.

07:17.800 --> 07:18.800
And if you can't...

07:20.400 --> 07:22.200
Well, then I guess you can't hear me.

07:30.200 --> 07:31.800
Good one, John!

07:32.400 --> 07:33.400
Shoot yourself!

07:34.800 --> 07:37.600
This is downright problematic, Rodney!

07:39.600 --> 07:43.400
To test a theory. Work with me here, people.
Look, if I'm right, we need to hurry.

07:44.400 --> 07:45.800
What are you doin', McKay?

07:45.840 --> 07:50.000
I am trying to determine how much
faster time is passing on the other
side of the portal than it is here.

07:50.040 --> 07:51.520
Why would time progress faster?

07:51.560 --> 07:52.400
That doesn't make any sense.

07:52.440 --> 07:54.400
That is what I am trying to prove.
Now, just wait!

07:59.800 --> 08:06.960
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine...

08:07.000 --> 08:08.800
- McKay...
- ten, bear with me,

08:08.840 --> 08:16.400
twelve, thirteen, fourteen, fifteen,
sixteen, seventeen, eighteen, nineteen, and twenty.

08:19.200 --> 08:20.600
A whole lot faster!

08:28.400 --> 08:29.600
Can you hear me now?

08:34.799 --> 08:39.400
The cave opens up to the other side of the ridge but
there's nothing in the immediate area I can survive on.

08:55.400 --> 08:58.200
OK, that's day two and I'm out of water.

08:58.240 --> 09:00.000
We don't leave our people behind,

09:01.200 --> 09:02.000
right?

09:05.000 --> 09:08.200
How about sending me a signal
to show me that you're still there?

09:08.240 --> 09:11.200
Doesn't have to be a rock,
you can write a damn note.

09:19.400 --> 09:23.400
I'm gonna turn off my radio for another
six hours to conserve the battery,

09:23.440 --> 09:26.800
and try to get some sleep.

09:29.200 --> 09:30.400
Sheppard out.

09:32.600 --> 09:34.800
The blossoms have aged several hours at least.

09:35.200 --> 09:37.800
We might be able to pick him up in the Jumper
but I need to get back to Atlantis.

09:37.840 --> 09:38.600
You're not goin' anywhere.

09:38.640 --> 09:44.000
It is a time dilation field, which means
that time is passing much faster on the other
side of the portal than it is here for us.

09:44.040 --> 09:46.400
I'm not sure of the exact ratio, but I need to go now.

09:46.440 --> 09:47.000
Why?

09:47.040 --> 09:47.800
<i>I don't have time</i>

09:47.840 --> 09:49.600
to explain temporal compression theory to you

09:49.640 --> 09:51.560
when every moment we stand here debating this,

09:51.600 --> 09:54.400
literally hours could be going by
for Colonel Sheppard relative to us.

09:54.440 --> 09:58.600
Look, hours equate to days, and days for us could
mean years for him. Do you get it now?

10:00.200 --> 10:01.080
<i>Teyla!</i>

10:01.120 --> 10:04.200
I need you to follow me back as far as
the Puddle Jumper and I'll explain
what I need you to do on the way.

10:07.000 --> 10:08.600
And you, stay here.

10:09.600 --> 10:10.440
And do what?

10:10.480 --> 10:12.400
Don't go through, if that's what you're thinking.

10:13.600 --> 10:14.520
Give me the knapsack.

10:14.840 --> 10:17.200
Rodney, Teyla... Ronon?

10:18.600 --> 10:19.800
Come in?

10:22.800 --> 10:24.960
You guys are starting to
worry me a little bit here.

10:25.000 --> 10:27.600
Empty your pockets, everything
you think he might need to survive.

10:33.400 --> 10:35.520
We might just buy him a little more time there.

10:36.200 --> 10:37.200
Come on.

10:37.240 --> 10:38.600
- Go.
- Good.

11:13.400 --> 11:15.600
What the hell took you guys so long?

11:33.600 --> 11:36.680
Alright. Emergency rations,
medical kit. Anything else?

11:36.720 --> 11:38.000
Extra batteries for the camcorder.

11:38.040 --> 11:39.360
Right. You know what to do?

11:39.400 --> 11:41.600
Press Record, extend and hold for three seconds.

11:41.640 --> 11:42.600
No more, no less.

11:42.640 --> 11:43.800
- And then pull it out again.
- Right.

11:43.840 --> 11:46.800
If he's still there, that should give him plenty
of time to record a detailed message.

11:46.840 --> 11:48.360
Dammit! Why didn't I send through a note?

11:48.400 --> 11:49.800
What do you mean if he is still there?

11:49.840 --> 11:51.960
Look,
depending on the compression ratio inside the field,

11:52.000 --> 11:55.600
there's a very good chance he may have used up the
supplies we've sent through by the time you get back.

11:56.000 --> 11:58.400
- I know it's hard to get your head around
but what it means is we have to...
- we must hurry.

11:58.440 --> 12:00.200
Right. Go-go-go-go-go-go-go.

12:01.200 --> 12:02.000
Good!

12:03.000 --> 12:03.800
Alright!

12:08.400 --> 12:09.200
Right!

12:14.200 --> 12:15.760
<i>What, you have no idea whether he's injured?</i>

12:15.800 --> 12:19.560
The excruciating pain he was experiencing
was a result of the temporal differential.

12:19.600 --> 12:20.800
And what is that, exactly?

12:20.840 --> 12:26.680
The... portal must somehow dampen
the extreme tidal forces that would normally occur
in the event horizon of a time dilation field,

12:26.720 --> 12:29.000
and we were keeping him from passing through it.

12:29.600 --> 12:33.400
So part of his body is experiencing time
at a different pace than the other?

12:33.440 --> 12:35.000
Who knows what that could do to him?

12:35.200 --> 12:37.800
I have no idea, but I suspect he could use a doctor.

12:38.000 --> 12:39.400
So you don't even know if he's alive?

12:39.440 --> 12:42.600
The most time-efficient approach was
to assume that he was alive but stranded.

12:42.640 --> 12:45.400
And why not assume that he'll make
his own way back through the portal?

12:45.440 --> 12:49.200
Because Cl Sheppard would have already had hours
to try to make it back through the portal in the time

12:49.240 --> 12:52.800
I wasted explaining the situation to Conan and Xena!

12:53.200 --> 12:54.760
- Now, Rodney, that's not very...
- No.

12:54.800 --> 12:55.960
No, I suppose it isn't.

12:56.000 --> 12:57.800
This is McKay. Supplies been loaded aboard yet?

12:57.840 --> 13:00.040
<i>Almost there, Sir. Just a few more cases.</i>

13:00.080 --> 13:04.800
Alright. When you're done with that,
make sure you assist Zelenka in securing
the descent probe into the launch compartment.

13:04.840 --> 13:05.800
Let's move.

13:12.200 --> 13:13.200
This is Sheppard.

13:14.000 --> 13:18.600
I'm pretty sure you can't hear me, but I don't
have a volleyball to talk to, so what the hell...

13:19.800 --> 13:23.000
I've rationed what little
I have for as long as I could but

13:23.040 --> 13:26.200
I have enough left for maybe one more day.

13:29.400 --> 13:33.000
I've gotta get myself something to live on while
I find my own source of food and water.

13:34.000 --> 13:40.600
Not that I didn't appreciate the three canteens
of water and the whole handful of power bars.

13:43.000 --> 13:46.600
There's nothing in the immediate area.
I'm gonna have to go further out.

13:47.400 --> 13:49.600
I'm giving you an indication of where I go,

13:50.400 --> 13:51.600
as I go.

13:53.000 --> 13:54.200
Sheppard out.

14:22.800 --> 14:23.800
That was quick.

14:24.000 --> 14:25.400
Not fast enough, I fear.

14:28.200 --> 14:29.200
Get the camera.

14:33.000 --> 14:35.200
Doctor McKay would like us to try this again.

14:35.240 --> 14:37.000
To see if Sheppard's still alive?

14:37.800 --> 14:40.800
And to determine the true
passage of time on the other side.

14:44.200 --> 14:45.200
Alright.

14:48.200 --> 14:49.200
Alright.

14:52.000 --> 14:55.400
One, two, three.

14:57.000 --> 14:58.800
That wasn't long enough to see anything.

15:00.600 --> 15:03.200
<i>And yet it seems to have recorded several minutes.</i>

15:10.000 --> 15:11.200
He is not there.

15:38.200 --> 15:41.800
Well, you're either gonna eat me, or...

15:42.400 --> 15:43.400
I'm gonna eat you.

15:51.000 --> 15:53.400
We've loaded weeks of supplies
and everything I could think of.

15:53.440 --> 15:54.800
What're we not thinking of?

15:54.840 --> 15:56.520
Now take a minute, and be certain.

15:56.560 --> 15:58.800
If your theory is correct,
you won't be able to make many of these trips.

15:58.840 --> 16:00.600
I am painfully aware of that.

16:00.640 --> 16:05.280
I remind you only because from what
you've told me, rushing is what got
Sheppard into trouble in the first place.

16:05.320 --> 16:06.960
This was not his fault, it was mine.

16:07.000 --> 16:09.960
I should have looked more closely at the video.
The clues were there before he even stepped through.

16:10.000 --> 16:13.000
Look, all I can hope
to do now is fix this within his lifetime.

16:13.800 --> 16:14.800
His lifetime?

16:14.840 --> 16:19.400
If it takes us a week to ten days to fix this,
then it won't matter,
because he will probably have died of old age.

16:19.440 --> 16:20.200
Oh my God.

16:20.240 --> 16:21.600
Yeah, hence the rushing.

16:21.800 --> 16:23.200
Now, you ready? You don't look ready.

16:23.240 --> 16:24.000
I'm ready.

16:24.040 --> 16:26.200
I need to pick up a few of my books
to help with the translation.

16:26.240 --> 16:28.440
Well, we'll pick `em up on the way,
and I hope you've got us a real Jumper pilot

16:28.480 --> 16:31.200
because I don't trust him and I can't
fly the damned thing in a straight line.

16:39.800 --> 16:40.600
<i>Help!</i>

16:40.800 --> 16:42.320
Help me, please!

16:44.320 --> 16:45.360
Where is it?

16:45.400 --> 16:46.800
It's there. In the trees.

16:47.760 --> 16:49.840
<i>- What is it?</i>
- The Beast!

16:49.880 --> 16:53.000
- Alright, is there a safe place for us to go?
- No, no, the Cloister is too far.

16:53.040 --> 16:53.960
It's upon us!

16:55.080 --> 16:57.400
Stay down, and stay behind me.

16:57.440 --> 16:58.280
You can't fight it!

16:58.320 --> 16:59.800
Maybe we can scare it away.

17:46.680 --> 17:48.040
Get outta here!

18:09.410 --> 18:10.930
<i>There it is.</i>

18:11.690 --> 18:14.570
Well, according to these readings,
it's not there.

18:14.850 --> 18:17.650
Rodney, I can see it with my own eyes
it's right inside that crater.

18:18.210 --> 18:23.650
It's hard to say whether the Ancients actually
built it inside the crater or whether the rim
formed as a result of the time dilation field.

18:23.690 --> 18:25.770
The Jumper sensors aren't picking up anything?

18:26.170 --> 18:27.610
Nothing, ma'am.

18:28.050 --> 18:31.650
Alright. Position us directly above it and stand by.

18:31.690 --> 18:33.650
Prepare to launch the probe on my mark.

18:33.690 --> 18:35.730
What is this probe of yours supposed to do?

18:35.770 --> 18:39.050
Well, it's supposed to descend slowly
into the atmosphere of a gas giant.

18:39.090 --> 18:43.630
The `chute opens, the probe separates into two
components joined by a tether hundreds of metres long.

18:43.670 --> 18:47.230
So we should be able to receive telemetry
from inside the time dilation field

18:47.270 --> 18:49.350
while the other half of the probe is still outside.

18:49.390 --> 18:53.190
Right. And depending on the variance, we might be
able to fly right into the field and rescue Sheppard.

18:53.230 --> 18:54.790
Very clever, Rodney!

18:55.150 --> 18:57.550
Yes, it is.

18:57.950 --> 18:59.350
Actually, it was Zelenka's idea.

19:13.350 --> 19:14.550
Hi.

19:17.190 --> 19:19.270
He's awake again!

19:19.390 --> 19:20.990
I am now!

19:26.950 --> 19:28.350
I am Teer.

19:30.630 --> 19:32.150
Have we met?

19:32.190 --> 19:34.070
When Avrid first brought you here.

19:34.110 --> 19:36.230
You were terribly injured from fighting the Beast.

19:36.270 --> 19:38.550
Avrid carried you almost
halfway across the Sanctuary.

19:38.590 --> 19:39.910
And I healed you.

19:40.550 --> 19:42.150
You did?

19:42.190 --> 19:44.390
You're a little young to be a doctor.

19:44.430 --> 19:47.310
Hedda is one of the few among us
who possesses the healing power.

19:48.470 --> 19:50.990
Well, good. Thank you.

19:51.030 --> 19:54.190
It's we who should thank you for
saving our brother from the Beast.

19:55.350 --> 19:57.390
It's funny,
I don't remember winning.

19:57.430 --> 19:59.950
It's good to see you awake and well again.

20:01.310 --> 20:02.910
Didn't it come after you?

20:02.950 --> 20:05.750
No.
Only the Ascended know why.

20:07.350 --> 20:09.270
None of them are around, are they?

20:09.310 --> 20:10.110
Are you hungry?

20:10.590 --> 20:12.150
Starving.

20:18.550 --> 20:21.110
Which one of you got me out
of my clothes and into these?

20:21.910 --> 20:23.110
I did.

20:25.510 --> 20:26.590
Is that alright?

20:26.630 --> 20:29.030
Yeah. I just usually like to...

20:29.430 --> 20:31.990
meet a woman before she sees me naked.

20:35.590 --> 20:37.550
What do we have here?

20:45.990 --> 20:49.390
I'm glad you're feeling better.
Welcome to your new home.

20:50.630 --> 20:54.990
Avrid, I'm happy to visit and I'm grateful
for the food and the whole healing thing, but...

20:55.030 --> 20:56.350
do you know the way out of here?

20:56.710 --> 21:00.030
There is no way to leave, John, other than to ascend.

21:01.270 --> 21:03.590
What exactly do you mean by "there's no way"?

21:05.150 --> 21:07.430
That is the sole purpose of this place...

21:07.470 --> 21:11.630
To meditate upon ascension and one day
join those who created the Sanctuary.

21:11.670 --> 21:14.150
The thing is, I've got other plans.

21:15.110 --> 21:17.270
Then why did you enter the portal?

21:17.310 --> 21:21.590
Well, call it a mistake. I tried to stop it
but the damned thing sucked me in.

21:22.870 --> 21:26.430
Those that came before us made certain
that there could be no indecision.

21:26.470 --> 21:29.430
Once you set foot within the Sanctuary,
your path was chosen.

21:29.470 --> 21:30.830
Not by me!

21:31.670 --> 21:36.230
Once you cross the threshold, you are committed
to be here for the remainder of your days.

21:53.430 --> 21:59.550
Alright. Launch the probe on my mark.
Three, two, one, mark.

22:04.110 --> 22:07.110
The probe's about to pass through the field.
Stand by.

22:08.790 --> 22:09.990
Dammit!

22:10.030 --> 22:12.310
- What happened?
- Exactly what I was afraid would happen.

22:12.430 --> 22:15.870
The probe was ripped apart by tidal forces
at the event horizon almost instantly.

22:15.910 --> 22:18.110
So we can't fly through it
and rescue Colonel Sheppard?

22:18.150 --> 22:20.350
Not unless we wanna be ripped apart too!

22:20.390 --> 22:23.150
Did you receive any telemetry
before the probe failed?

22:23.190 --> 22:26.270
Actually quite a lot.
Looks like mostly gibberish, though.

22:26.310 --> 22:28.630
This is gonna take me the better
part of an hour to go through.

22:32.150 --> 22:34.470
I'm glad I finally got you outside.

22:34.510 --> 22:36.510
You've been alone in your room for so long.

22:36.550 --> 22:38.110
I'm being depressed.

22:38.750 --> 22:40.710
Is it so terrible here?

22:40.750 --> 22:42.550
No, you folks have been great. It's just...

22:42.590 --> 22:44.390
I have responsibilities back home.

22:44.430 --> 22:46.750
People I care about, and who care about me.

22:47.150 --> 22:48.670
At least I thought they did.

22:51.430 --> 22:52.870
Why'd you come here?

22:53.470 --> 22:54.870
Well, I was born here.

22:54.910 --> 22:56.390
No, I mean your people.

22:56.830 --> 22:59.270
Well, they came generations ago.

22:59.710 --> 23:04.790
I'm from a race of people who revered those who
came before us, those who created this place.

23:05.270 --> 23:06.910
We call them Ancients.

23:06.990 --> 23:09.510
To follow in their footsteps, to ascend,

23:09.550 --> 23:11.990
was the greatest goal among our forefathers.

23:13.270 --> 23:16.910
Many centuries ago, some of our people
sensed it was within them to do so.

23:16.950 --> 23:21.630
It took them many years to discover the
location of this world and once they found it,

23:21.830 --> 23:24.390
they came to this world as a pilgrimage.

23:24.830 --> 23:26.630
We are their descendants.

23:26.710 --> 23:28.310
Not many of you left.

23:28.350 --> 23:31.590
No. We are the last.

23:33.230 --> 23:35.150
So what's holdin' you back?

23:35.670 --> 23:38.670
Journeys such as ours can take a lifetime.

23:40.430 --> 23:42.430
You afraid it might not happen?

23:43.390 --> 23:45.230
We're not afraid of anything.

23:46.550 --> 23:49.550
Well, I'd be pretty afraid of that Beast thing.

23:50.350 --> 23:53.150
As long as we stay in the Cloister, we're safe.

23:53.190 --> 23:54.390
And what kind of life is that?

23:54.670 --> 23:59.230
Well, life here is not entirely without its pleasures.

24:07.270 --> 24:10.470
The telemetry was not entirely
gibberish. Bring up the HUD.

24:11.550 --> 24:15.350
I've been able to determine the location
of the power source inside the field, here.

24:16.470 --> 24:17.550
What good is that?

24:17.590 --> 24:21.590
Once we know where the generator is,
one way or another,
I should be able to turn it off.

25:32.950 --> 25:35.710
You know, you don't have to do
this for me every morning.

25:35.750 --> 25:37.270
You saved my brother's life.

25:37.310 --> 25:39.830
Then shouldn't he be the one
bringing me breakfast?

25:39.870 --> 25:41.470
He is meditating with the others.

25:41.510 --> 25:45.870
He's always meditating.
Everyone's always meditating.

25:47.230 --> 25:50.430
At least share it with me.

26:05.430 --> 26:06.630
It's OK.

26:07.510 --> 26:09.270
It is very close.

26:12.710 --> 26:13.910
It's here.

26:15.470 --> 26:17.670
It's never come inside the Cloister.

26:17.710 --> 26:18.990
- I am scared.
- It's OK.

26:19.030 --> 26:20.550
- Take her inside.
- John...

26:20.670 --> 26:22.150
- Do it.
- Go.

26:32.310 --> 26:37.150
OK, people, I'm starting to develop
some serious abandonment issues here!

26:40.150 --> 26:42.190
OK, but I'm warning you I've got a knife!

26:42.350 --> 26:45.270
<i>No! Come back!
Come back! Come back!</i>

26:47.790 --> 26:49.670
Now there's two of us!

26:58.110 --> 26:59.310
Ronon!

27:00.910 --> 27:02.870
He left a sign for us to see.

27:06.910 --> 27:09.270
He must have gone to look for another way out.

27:09.350 --> 27:11.190
At least we know he may still be alive.

27:11.230 --> 27:14.710
<i>Teyla, Ronon. We're inbound in the Jumper
and should touch down in a few minutes.</i>

27:14.750 --> 27:15.750
<i>Meet us at the landing site.</i>

27:15.790 --> 27:16.870
Understood.

27:36.070 --> 27:37.950
We thought we'd lost you again.

27:39.070 --> 27:40.790
What happened?

27:40.830 --> 27:42.670
I've never seen such bravery.

27:42.710 --> 27:45.110
Were it not for you, all may have been lost.

27:45.350 --> 27:48.230
I don't remember winning this time either.

27:50.070 --> 27:52.790
He's not fully healed.

27:54.350 --> 27:56.950
- I'm fine.
- You've done enough, Hedda. Come on.

27:56.990 --> 27:58.590
Let's get you some rest.

28:10.470 --> 28:12.910
What the hell's the matter with you people?

28:13.230 --> 28:14.710
I don't understand.

28:15.190 --> 28:18.510
I'm talking about letting her stand
out there alone against that thing.

28:18.670 --> 28:21.190
Violence is not the path to ascension.

28:21.230 --> 28:23.270
There's a difference between violence and self-defence.

28:23.550 --> 28:26.150
We are very close to ascension, John.

28:26.190 --> 28:27.390
All of us.

28:27.430 --> 28:29.870
If we leave the path,
it may be lost to us forever.

28:29.910 --> 28:33.590
Everything may be lost to you forever
unless you stand up to that damned thing.

28:36.750 --> 28:39.150
I must join the others in meditation.

28:48.150 --> 28:49.310
You sure it was three seconds?

28:49.350 --> 28:50.150
Yes.

28:50.190 --> 28:51.390
And there's twelve minutes of video.

28:51.430 --> 28:52.030
Yes.

28:52.070 --> 28:53.510
Alright, so it's a ratio of about...

28:53.550 --> 28:54.910
Two hundred and fifty to one.

28:56.430 --> 28:57.830
I sent my watch through,

28:57.870 --> 29:01.990
along with a letter to Colonel Sheppard
telling him we're doing our best to rescue him.

29:02.030 --> 29:03.510
If you would like to check again...

29:03.550 --> 29:05.510
No, that's good, that's good,
that's good, good..good thinking.

29:05.550 --> 29:09.070
Just out of curiosity, what does that mean
for Colonel Sheppard in terms of... days?

29:09.110 --> 29:10.630
We're already talking months.

29:16.950 --> 29:18.750
You don't have to wait up for me.

29:19.870 --> 29:21.670
You've been gone over a day.

29:21.710 --> 29:24.790
Yeah, well, after I found my weapons,

29:24.830 --> 29:27.790
I decided to take a run all the way back
to the portal, and look what I found.

29:27.830 --> 29:31.990
I don't know what took `em so long,
but my friends finally sent some supplies through.

29:33.870 --> 29:36.150
There are people here who care for you.

29:36.510 --> 29:37.910
Sorry, I should've...

29:38.710 --> 29:40.070
told somebody.

29:40.750 --> 29:41.950
<i>I knew.</i>

29:42.790 --> 29:45.310
I was following your journey in my mind.

29:45.350 --> 29:47.470
I was with you since you left the Cloister.

29:48.070 --> 29:50.630
Is that some special power
of yours you haven't told me about?

29:50.670 --> 29:51.790
Yes.

29:54.950 --> 29:58.550
I've been with you each time
you've searched for a means to leave us.

29:58.590 --> 30:02.390
As Hedda has the power to heal,
I am able to see images in my mind.

30:02.430 --> 30:06.350
It's not uncommon for those on the
path to ascension to gain such abilities.

30:06.390 --> 30:10.950
I wish you woulda told me, I could've used you
out there. It took me forever to find this stuff!

30:10.990 --> 30:14.710
Before my mother ascended,
she could move things with her mind.

30:14.750 --> 30:17.950
You can imagine how wondrous
that would be for a child.

30:18.030 --> 30:19.630
Sit with me.

30:33.750 --> 30:35.830
I was the one who sent Avrid to find you.

30:36.630 --> 30:37.390
You did?

30:37.430 --> 30:39.430
Because I knew you were coming that night,

30:39.870 --> 30:42.390
and I knew where you would be in the field

30:42.430 --> 30:44.350
and I have known since I was a child

30:44.550 --> 30:47.550
that you would sit here with me as you do now.

30:47.590 --> 30:52.150
I've been able to close my eyes and
see your face my entire life, John.

30:53.070 --> 30:54.550
You are the one.

30:57.310 --> 30:58.750
The one what?

30:58.790 --> 31:01.630
The one who will lead us to ascension.

31:06.070 --> 31:07.030
What is it?

31:07.070 --> 31:10.550
Nothin'. I just was hoping you were
going in a different direction with that.

31:12.390 --> 31:13.590
I've seen that as well.

31:15.790 --> 31:18.230
That's why I waited for you.

31:19.110 --> 31:20.430
Really?

31:21.990 --> 31:23.390
Tonight.

31:23.910 --> 31:25.230
Tonight?

31:25.510 --> 31:29.910
I... I wish you woulda told me,
I wouldn't have gone on a ten-hour run.

31:29.950 --> 31:32.910
And in the coming days,
once you have defeated the Beast,

31:33.350 --> 31:35.110
we will ascend together,

31:35.150 --> 31:36.190
all of us.

31:37.270 --> 31:39.190
You mean all of you.

31:39.230 --> 31:41.150
I haven't given up on you just yet.

31:41.190 --> 31:44.990
I don't know how that's gonna happen, Teer.
I really don't.

31:46.030 --> 31:48.990
Look, I've been up against that thing twice.

31:49.030 --> 31:51.990
I don't see how a third time's
gonna turn out any different.

31:53.630 --> 31:55.590
You don't have to know how.

31:56.230 --> 31:59.030
You just have to trust that it will.

32:16.870 --> 32:18.230
<i>OK, I think I've got it.</i>

32:19.310 --> 32:24.470
I am interpreting a bit, but it seems the field
was designed as a sanctuary from the Wraith,

32:24.510 --> 32:29.390
but a place the last of the Ancients could travel
to and hopefully ascend without fear of attack.

32:29.430 --> 32:33.510
Of course.
They could potentially spend entire lifetimes inside
the field before the Wraith even discovered the place.

32:33.550 --> 32:36.670
And if they ever attacked, their ships
would get torn apart just as the probe did.

32:36.710 --> 32:39.310
And so it has remained for ten thousand years.

32:39.350 --> 32:40.550
<i>This writing here...</i>

32:40.990 --> 32:43.430
this serves as a sort of welcome,

32:43.470 --> 32:48.110
as well as a warning for any of the humans
under their protection looking for sanctuary,

32:48.150 --> 32:53.110
but I think it was left there for anyone who wanted
to seek the path to ascension on their own.

32:53.150 --> 32:54.670
And what's the warning?

32:55.950 --> 32:58.270
That once you cross the threshold,
there's no return.

32:58.310 --> 33:03.950
That is, unless you have the exact location of the
power source and the expertise to turn it off.

33:03.990 --> 33:05.670
Hey, we may even get a ZedPM out of this.

33:05.710 --> 33:06.790
Now you're talkin'.

33:06.830 --> 33:09.670
Lieutenant, this is Weir.
If you haven't heard from us in...

33:09.750 --> 33:10.710
Rodney?

33:10.750 --> 33:12.910
Well, an hour would give us months in there, but,

33:12.950 --> 33:15.150
Elizabeth, of all the people
who should stay, it would be you.

33:15.190 --> 33:17.710
<i>There may be writing by the
power source that needs translating.</i>

33:17.750 --> 33:19.350
- There is a slight chance that when we go through...
<i>- Rodney,</i>

33:19.390 --> 33:20.710
I'm going.

33:20.750 --> 33:25.030
Lieutenant, one hour, then head back to Atlantis
and see if Zelenka can think of anything.

33:25.070 --> 33:26.070
<i>Understood.</i>

33:26.110 --> 33:29.470
Well, he may need medical treatment and I'm the
only doctor here, so I should probably just...

33:29.510 --> 33:32.830
Carson, it probably won't hurt so
much if you just go through quickly.

33:32.870 --> 33:35.910
Alright, let's do this.

33:45.790 --> 33:47.030
That wasn't so bad!

33:49.350 --> 33:50.510
You were just...

33:50.550 --> 33:52.230
That's weird...?

33:53.230 --> 33:55.630
<i>Well, we may as well relax.
The others are gonna be at least five minutes.</i>

33:55.670 --> 33:57.750
Judging by the location of the power source,

33:57.790 --> 33:59.990
we've got a long walk ahead of us, so...

34:11.750 --> 34:14.469
Haven't any of you seen thunderstorms?

34:14.510 --> 34:17.030
The Sanctuary provides rain for the orchards.

34:17.110 --> 34:19.469
I'm talkin' about thunder and lightning.

34:19.510 --> 34:22.630
Giant bolts of electricity shooting down from the sky.

34:22.670 --> 34:24.150
Sounds scary.

34:24.870 --> 34:27.630
Well, it is scary, but it's also very cool.

34:28.469 --> 34:31.350
It's OK to be scared, it's part of life.

34:31.389 --> 34:36.389
You know, when I was a kid, we used to have storms
that shook the house. Scared me half to death.

34:36.429 --> 34:39.190
When we are ascended,
we will experience such things.

34:39.230 --> 34:42.190
Hell, if you're ascended,
you can make thunderstorms!

34:42.230 --> 34:45.310
I'm talking about actually experiencing life.

34:45.350 --> 34:48.750
We contemplate on the experience that is life each day.

34:49.590 --> 34:51.429
I'm talking about living it.

34:53.350 --> 34:57.350
Haven't any of you got things you wanna
do as flesh and blood human beings first?

34:58.630 --> 35:00.350
I mean, you, you talk about

35:00.390 --> 35:05.270
moving on to a plane of existence beyond your
own mortality, but you haven't even really lived.

35:05.310 --> 35:07.110
Our lives are full.

35:07.150 --> 35:11.350
Well, I've spent a long time with you folks, and
I don't think "full" means what you think it means.

35:11.390 --> 35:13.430
<i>To ascend, one must meditate.</i>

35:13.470 --> 35:15.750
You're not meditating, you're hiding.

35:15.790 --> 35:17.150
From what?

35:18.190 --> 35:19.950
You know the answer to that.

35:21.870 --> 35:24.030
He means the Beast.

35:24.070 --> 35:25.950
<i>Yes, I do.</i>

35:25.990 --> 35:30.390
Now I don't know how any of you expect me to feel like
I belong here, but every time that thing comes around,

35:30.430 --> 35:32.550
I'm out there alone.

35:38.350 --> 35:40.190
You're not alone.

35:40.350 --> 35:42.190
I know, you were out there too.

35:42.230 --> 35:45.190
No, I mean your friends have come.

35:45.230 --> 35:46.870
<i>They number five.</i>

35:48.270 --> 35:49.550
They've come for you.

35:49.830 --> 35:52.350
They have? Are, are you sure?
That's the best news I've...

35:52.390 --> 35:55.030
No, John,
I sense something more.

35:55.830 --> 35:57.870
The Beast is nearly upon them.

36:01.310 --> 36:04.350
You know, I was just thinking,
this entire field, I mean not the field

36:04.390 --> 36:05.910
I mean the field, field

36:05.950 --> 36:08.950
must generate its own day and night cycle,
not to mention its own artificial climate.

36:08.990 --> 36:09.950
I mean, it's incredible! When you think...

36:09.990 --> 36:11.550
You wanna pick up the pace, McKay?

36:11.590 --> 36:14.150
Hey, he's waited for months.
Another half hour isn't gonna kill him.

36:14.190 --> 36:16.110
We don't know how long
it's gonna take to find him.

36:16.150 --> 36:19.750
Aye, and besides that, I have a date planned
with Lieutenant Cadman for tomorrow night.

36:19.790 --> 36:22.830
Oh, no, so we've only got twelve years in here!

36:23.470 --> 36:25.990
What? What is it?

36:29.030 --> 36:29.910
I'm not detecting anything.

36:29.950 --> 36:31.550
Doesn't mean it isn't there.

36:32.070 --> 36:33.150
Can you see anything?

36:33.190 --> 36:36.910
No. But I sense something is close.

36:36.950 --> 36:38.710
Maybe we should try another way?

36:41.550 --> 36:43.790
Won't make any difference.
It's stalking us.

36:43.830 --> 36:45.390
Sounds like it's more than one.

36:45.430 --> 36:47.230
Yeah, more than one what?

36:47.270 --> 36:48.510
I do not know.

37:22.150 --> 37:24.310
What the hell took you so long?

37:24.350 --> 37:26.710
Believe it or not, you were
only gone a couple of hours.

37:26.750 --> 37:27.670
Try six months!

37:27.710 --> 37:29.950
You don't understand, you've been
trapped in a time dilation field.

37:29.990 --> 37:30.630
What?

37:30.670 --> 37:32.150
- What was that bloody thing?
- I don't know.

37:32.190 --> 37:34.030
What's a time dilation field?

37:34.070 --> 37:35.830
<i>Can we talk about this somewhere else?</i>

37:35.870 --> 37:38.350
No, it is still close.

37:58.390 --> 37:59.910
You've fought this thing before?

37:59.950 --> 38:00.870
Twice.

38:02.310 --> 38:03.590
How did you beat it?

38:03.630 --> 38:05.190
Still haven't figured that out.

38:06.230 --> 38:07.390
Now'd be a good time.

38:07.430 --> 38:11.470
Yeah, well, what'd you say we just
fight it and see what happens?

38:11.670 --> 38:12.870
<i>John?</i>

38:13.710 --> 38:15.550
Friends of yours?

38:19.630 --> 38:21.990
We've come to stand with you,
whatever happens.

38:22.030 --> 38:24.670
No, we've come to fight.

38:25.870 --> 38:27.670
And we are not afraid of you.

38:29.510 --> 38:31.670
<i>The Beast is of our own creation,</i>

38:32.070 --> 38:35.510
and it is long past time we sent it away.

39:04.270 --> 39:05.910
That's it?
That's all it took?

39:05.990 --> 39:09.430
You were right, John.
We were afraid.

39:09.870 --> 39:14.470
The Beast was the final burden we had
to shed, manifest from our own fears.

39:14.910 --> 39:17.110
You gave us the courage to face it.

39:20.750 --> 39:22.350
Come with us.

39:26.350 --> 39:28.990
I'm not ready for that yet.

39:29.670 --> 39:32.150
I'm not sure I'll ever be.

39:32.190 --> 39:33.750
One day, perhaps?

39:35.230 --> 39:36.550
Yeah, one day.

39:37.870 --> 39:40.310
I'll look forward to it.

39:41.190 --> 39:44.230
There'll be no need to destroy
the Sanctuary, Doctor McKay.

39:44.270 --> 39:45.310
What?

39:45.630 --> 39:47.390
No..., I wasn't thinking that, I was...

39:47.430 --> 39:49.630
We will keep the portal open
for you until you are gone.

39:49.670 --> 39:52.630
At which point the ZedPM which undoubtedly
powers this beautiful place will be...

39:52.670 --> 39:55.870
Sanctuary was left by those who came before us,

39:55.910 --> 39:58.750
for those who may seek it out and follow the path.

39:59.230 --> 40:01.230
And it will continue to remain

40:01.670 --> 40:03.070
after you are gone.

40:04.070 --> 40:04.950
Yeah, but...

40:09.270 --> 40:11.270
Absolutely.

40:36.190 --> 40:38.910
What is it with you and ascended women?

40:43.030 --> 40:46.550
Well, the beard is interesting!

40:47.590 --> 40:50.150
First thing to go when we get home.

40:50.190 --> 40:52.150
<i>Never thought I'd see any of you again.</i>

40:52.190 --> 40:53.830
Kind of even...

40:54.470 --> 40:55.910
missed you a little.

40:56.070 --> 40:58.510
Yeah, well, it was only
a couple of hours for us, so...

40:58.550 --> 40:59.710
Ronon.

41:00.230 --> 41:01.790
We were all quite worried about you.

41:01.830 --> 41:02.710
Of course we were.

41:02.750 --> 41:05.070
We're just sorry
we didn't get here sooner.

41:07.950 --> 41:10.310
Let's get outta here!
