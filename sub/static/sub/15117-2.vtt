09:57.326 --> 09:59.661
Well, it's important
to treat all your employees

09:59.729 --> 10:01.229
With mutual respect.

10:01.263 --> 10:04.565
Colleen!
Hi! I brought
your favorite.

10:04.600 --> 10:05.967
Oh, thank you.

10:06.001 --> 10:08.368
Inside-out
salami sandwich?

10:08.402 --> 10:09.569
Come on.
You're the best.

10:09.603 --> 10:11.338
Look at you
all dressed up.

10:11.405 --> 10:12.638
Tied it myself.
Ooh!

10:12.673 --> 10:14.640
Look, mom,
what's the problem?

10:14.674 --> 10:17.309
[ sighs ]

10:17.343 --> 10:19.377
I need your blessing...

10:19.412 --> 10:20.912
To sell the house
you were born in.

10:22.382 --> 10:24.316
Finally.
It's only been 10 years.

10:24.350 --> 10:27.386
Hey, hey, hey.
Big decisions are tough for her.

10:27.420 --> 10:29.355
Over-thinking can be
a good quality.

10:29.422 --> 10:30.823
I agree.

10:30.857 --> 10:32.358
I mean, after all these years
as a single woman,

10:32.425 --> 10:33.993
I've never had
a one-night stand.

10:34.027 --> 10:35.527
I mean,
a lot of close calls.

10:35.595 --> 10:36.662
Definitely
some heavy petting.

10:36.696 --> 10:38.964
Definitely.
Mom. Boundaries.

10:38.999 --> 10:42.001
Since when do you observe
boundaries, you prude?

10:42.035 --> 10:43.536
Since my mom
is about to tell you

10:43.604 --> 10:44.837
About letting someone go
to second base with her.

10:44.872 --> 10:46.873
Unh -- third.
Third base -- hello.

10:46.941 --> 10:48.842
So, have you
spoken to janie?

10:48.876 --> 10:51.512
Yes. She's a d.A. We see
her all the time. We're
seeing her at 11:00.

10:51.546 --> 10:52.847
So, you know.

10:52.881 --> 10:54.348
Know what?

10:55.951 --> 10:57.785
I can't believe janie postponed
her wedding again.

10:57.819 --> 10:59.554
That's two times
and counting.

10:59.621 --> 11:01.789
Your mom said it was 'cause it
was monsoon season in thailand.

11:01.823 --> 11:03.724
Which you can find out
in two seconds on google

11:03.792 --> 11:05.458
Before you plan
a destination wedding.

11:05.493 --> 11:07.460
Your mom is awesome.

11:07.494 --> 11:09.729
She was the only mom who
took us to r-rated movies
when we were like 12.

11:09.796 --> 11:11.030
<i>You know what?
My mis    an r-rated movie.</i>

11:11.064 --> 11:13.633
It's not easy
having the cool mom. Trust me.

11:13.667 --> 11:14.734
Where'd you park?
Whoa.

11:16.036 --> 11:18.371
A little less stealthy
next time, vipe, okay?

11:18.405 --> 11:19.672
Sorry.
It's involuntary.

11:19.707 --> 11:21.508
So, where'd you park?
Seriously.

11:21.542 --> 11:22.809
Hill street.
Hill street.

11:22.843 --> 11:24.511
Good. Two-hour parking,
9:00 to 6:00.

11:24.545 --> 11:26.947
That will work.

11:26.982 --> 11:28.616
Okay.

11:30.385 --> 11:31.586
[ sighs ]

11:33.923 --> 11:36.592
Right here.

11:36.659 --> 11:38.393
That's you, buddy.

11:38.428 --> 11:39.895
Hey, guys.
Got a second?

11:39.929 --> 11:41.496
Alone.

11:44.900 --> 11:46.001
Please?

11:49.739 --> 11:51.573
Sorry to hear
about the wedding.

11:51.607 --> 11:54.410
Oh. Oh, yeah.
Monsoon season.

11:54.444 --> 11:55.511
I don't know
what we were thinking.

11:55.545 --> 11:57.112
Who told you?

11:57.146 --> 11:58.514
My mom.
His mom.

11:58.548 --> 12:00.716
Ah, colleen.
I miss your mom.

12:00.750 --> 12:02.617
She's the same
as always -- daffy.

12:02.652 --> 12:04.819
Who am I kidding?
She's not daffy.
She's insane.

12:04.853 --> 12:06.921
No, she is not.
But your client is,

12:06.955 --> 12:08.589
And that's what I want
to talk to you about.

12:08.623 --> 12:10.691
Janie, this is a clear-cut case
of self defense.

12:10.725 --> 12:12.392
You can't corner
a crime fighter

12:12.426 --> 12:13.860
And expect him
not to lash out.

12:13.894 --> 12:16.395
These guys are like
bengal tigers.

12:16.430 --> 12:19.098
Anyway, the victim
was a total scumbag.
Right.

12:19.132 --> 12:20.700
So, we will be good

12:20.734 --> 12:23.436
If your client does 120 days
in a psych ward

12:23.471 --> 12:25.071
And cops
to non compos mentis.

12:27.541 --> 12:28.874
How about no days

12:28.909 --> 12:30.676
And no declaration
of mental incompetence?

12:30.710 --> 12:32.811
You're not gonna get
this deal again.

12:32.845 --> 12:33.979
[ shudders ]
I'm quaking.

12:34.046 --> 12:35.614
I was gonna
give you my jacket.

12:35.648 --> 12:37.048
No, I was just
quaking in fear.

12:37.083 --> 12:38.116
We'll run this by vipe.

12:38.151 --> 12:39.151
Vipe? Really?

12:39.185 --> 12:40.619
Yeah. Oh, yeah.
Okay.

12:40.653 --> 12:42.421
Vipe.

12:45.492 --> 12:46.926
Stand down, friend.

12:48.129 --> 12:51.098
The d.A. Made us
an offer.
Good.

12:51.132 --> 12:52.800
They're just as eager

12:52.834 --> 12:54.001
To get past this tragic
misunderstanding as I am.

12:54.069 --> 12:56.437
Uh...Sort of.

12:56.472 --> 12:58.940
They want to declare you
mentally unfit,

12:58.974 --> 13:01.609
Send you to a psychiatric unit
for four months,

13:01.643 --> 13:03.044
Then you'll be free.

13:03.078 --> 13:06.014
I didn't kill that man.

13:06.048 --> 13:07.715
Now,
I'm sorry he's dead,

13:07.750 --> 13:09.951
But I am not gonna
sign my life away.

13:09.985 --> 13:11.986
If we turn this down
and we lose this case,

13:12.021 --> 13:14.455
You could spend the rest
of your life behind bars.

13:14.490 --> 13:18.192
Unless you can bend steel,
we recommend you take it.

13:18.227 --> 13:21.629
If I accept their offer,
it'd be like giving up.

13:21.664 --> 13:23.665
It'd be like
letting the bad guys win.

13:23.699 --> 13:25.968
And hear me now,
my righteous defenders --

13:26.002 --> 13:28.804
I never let the bad guys win,
and I never give up.

13:30.173 --> 13:31.607
Neither do we.

13:31.641 --> 13:32.775
Let's go to trial.

13:32.809 --> 13:34.543
Trial.

13:39.575 --> 13:39.575
+

13:44.602 --> 13:47.771
In 2009, the dean gave viper
a commendation

13:47.805 --> 13:49.573
For putting
a small trash fire out.

13:49.607 --> 13:52.877
He patrols between 10:00 p.M.
And 3:00 a.M.

13:52.911 --> 13:55.946
He says that's when the campus
is a "den of villains."

13:55.981 --> 13:57.414
His words.

13:57.449 --> 13:58.783

under a cloak of darkness!

14:12.098 --> 14:14.633
And what if I ignored you
every time you wanted
to suckle my breasts?

14:14.668 --> 14:16.836
Until he was 8 years old,
this one.

14:16.870 --> 14:18.504

someone bought the house.
So fast?

14:34.720 --> 14:36.487
I thought it would take
a couple of months.

14:36.522 --> 14:39.956
But some guy plunked down cash
two hours after I listed it,

14:39.991 --> 14:41.658
And now I have to move out
immediately.

14:41.692 --> 14:43.827
What about escrow?
He was a very
motivated buyer.

14:43.861 --> 14:46.095
No escrow.
"as is" immediate possession.

Sounds like
a predatory developer.

14:48.198 --> 14:50.499
I told you I should
have given it more thought.

There's lots of houses.

are you gonna live?

At least till you figure out
your housing situation.

15:12.624 --> 15:15.060

a couple days.

artificial deadlines on things.

Nothing.

18:52.347 --> 18:53.715
It doesn't make
any sense.

18:53.749 --> 18:55.116
Viper,
let me ask you something --

18:55.151 --> 18:57.185
Why are you not
in the superhero world registry?

18:57.219 --> 18:58.720
I'm suspicious
of online groups.

18:58.754 --> 19:01.356
My squad and I
are strictly off-the-grid.

19:01.390 --> 19:02.356
Wait. Wait a second.
You have a squad?

19:02.391 --> 19:03.824
Yes. I formed it,

19:03.858 --> 19:05.359
Along with three other
real-life superheroes.

19:05.393 --> 19:08.028
We, uh, have
a code of conduct and bylaws --

19:08.063 --> 19:12.099
How we execute an order,
neutralize a situation,

19:12.134 --> 19:14.435
Comport ourselves in public.

19:14.469 --> 19:16.236
Okay, this is good.

19:16.271 --> 19:17.972
It is?
I don't understand.

19:18.006 --> 19:19.707
Well, it wasn't
a decision you made

19:19.741 --> 19:21.108
In the heat of the moment.

19:21.143 --> 19:22.777
No. You were following
a structured protocol.

19:22.811 --> 19:24.145
That's true.

19:24.179 --> 19:26.214
You pursue the culprit
and maintain visual contact

19:26.248 --> 19:28.249
Until the authorities arrive --
standard operating procedure.

19:28.284 --> 19:29.417
Why?
What are you thinking?

19:29.451 --> 19:32.253
That you're a man
with a plan.

19:32.288 --> 19:34.355
Viper, we need to meet
your fellow heroes

19:34.390 --> 19:35.523
Who keep the city safe.

19:48.405 --> 19:50.172
This is too good.

19:50.240 --> 19:52.441
No way.
Let me
do the talking.

19:52.475 --> 19:54.743
Yeah, I got news for you --
that's not gonna happen.

19:54.778 --> 19:58.180
Neeb, bagger, ted,
these are my lawyers --

19:58.248 --> 20:00.282
Peter bash
and jared franklin.

20:00.317 --> 20:01.383
What's up?

20:01.418 --> 20:03.152
How's it looking,
fellas?

20:03.186 --> 20:04.420
We come...In peace.

20:04.454 --> 20:06.322
They're not aliens,
peter.

20:06.356 --> 20:07.757
Inebrio's on patrol,

20:07.791 --> 20:09.358
So we're gonna
have to do this quickly.

20:09.392 --> 20:11.160
Gentlemen,
tell them what you do.

20:11.194 --> 20:12.795
I make sure drunk women
don't go home with dangerous men

20:12.830 --> 20:14.330
Who might
take advantage of them.

20:14.364 --> 20:16.165
Bagger man: I'm bagger man.
I patrol store premises

20:16.199 --> 20:18.400
And help customers
safely unload their groceries.

20:18.434 --> 20:21.169
Bus ted: Bus ted.
I police city buses

20:21.204 --> 20:23.804
And make sure that
the elderly and the
handicapped aren't harassed.

20:23.839 --> 20:26.474
Guys, we need you
to testify in court tomorrow

20:26.509 --> 20:28.810
As character witnesses
for viper.

20:28.845 --> 20:30.011
We need to show the protocol

20:30.046 --> 20:31.780
Doesn't promote violence
or revenge.

20:31.814 --> 20:33.949
I think I speak for all of us
when I say

20:33.983 --> 20:35.317
We'd do anything for viper.

20:37.955 --> 20:39.822
What time?
3:00.

20:39.857 --> 20:40.857
0500.

20:40.891 --> 20:42.125
1500.

20:42.159 --> 20:43.393
1500.

20:43.427 --> 20:45.228
1500. 1500.

20:45.263 --> 20:48.498
Guys, one more thing --
no costumes.

20:48.533 --> 20:50.433
It's a uniform.

20:50.468 --> 20:51.501
Right.

20:51.535 --> 20:54.137
Inebrio: Hey!

20:54.171 --> 20:56.839
Step away from the sleaze,
young lady!

20:56.874 --> 20:58.207
Hey!
[ air horn blows ]

20:58.242 --> 21:00.342
Step away from the sleaze,
young lady!

21:00.376 --> 21:01.510
That's awesome.

21:01.544 --> 21:02.945
It's what we do.

21:08.051 --> 21:09.518
A lot of thought
and discussion

21:09.552 --> 21:11.387
Went into
the crime prevention creed.

21:11.421 --> 21:12.822
We also made a vow

21:12.856 --> 21:14.457
To be on call at all times
for justice.

21:14.492 --> 21:17.093
Bagger man,
in your experience,

21:17.127 --> 21:19.429
Is viper violent
to suspects?

21:19.464 --> 21:21.431
Never.
It would violate the creed.

21:21.466 --> 21:23.233
We wrote it ourselves.

21:23.268 --> 21:25.235
Actually, we drew inspiration
from other source material.

21:25.269 --> 21:28.239
Mr. Piper, can you tell us
where you got your inspiration

21:28.273 --> 21:31.042
When writing the "league of
the greater northeast

21:31.076 --> 21:33.078
"los angeles real-life
superheroes

21:33.112 --> 21:35.848
Code of conduct
and honor"?

21:35.882 --> 21:40.353
It's from the neighborhood
watch group of encino.

21:40.388 --> 21:43.890
A standard neighborhood
crime-prevention organization,

21:43.925 --> 21:44.925
Yeah?

21:44.959 --> 21:46.226
Yes, sir.

21:46.260 --> 21:49.596
No more questions.

21:49.630 --> 21:51.131
[ sighs ]

21:51.198 --> 21:53.967
Mr. Piper, can you please
read aloud to the court

21:54.035 --> 21:57.237
The last rule on your league's
code of conduct and honor?

21:57.271 --> 22:02.041
Certainly.
"be intolerant of injustice."

22:02.075 --> 22:05.110
And, I -- I'm sorry.

22:05.145 --> 22:07.379
This is probably my fault,
but can you tell me

22:07.414 --> 22:09.615
Where that is in the encino
neighborhood watch manual?

22:09.649 --> 22:11.484
We amended it.

22:11.551 --> 22:14.620
Okay. Can you just explain
what you meant?

22:14.654 --> 22:18.524
We refuse
to accept injustice.

22:18.558 --> 22:22.294
Gosh.
How do you do that?

22:23.596 --> 22:26.365
We make sure
justice is done.

22:26.399 --> 22:28.534
So, you're judge, jury,
and executioner?

22:28.568 --> 22:30.468
Objection.
Argumentative.

22:30.503 --> 22:31.670
Sustained.

22:31.704 --> 22:33.338
Isn't meting out justice

22:33.406 --> 22:36.440
The job of the man
in the black robe to your right

22:36.475 --> 22:41.512
Or the 12 members of
the justice league to your left?

22:41.547 --> 22:43.181
Well, of course it is.

22:43.248 --> 22:45.083
But with all due respect
to this important institution,

22:45.117 --> 22:46.284
Sometimes --

22:46.319 --> 22:48.286
Sometimes there are
exceptions?

22:48.320 --> 22:49.487
Yes.

22:49.522 --> 22:52.490
So, is one
of those exceptions

22:52.525 --> 22:54.225
The man who fell to his death,
paul winstead?

22:54.259 --> 22:56.227
Objection! Argumentative!
Objection! Argumentative!

22:56.261 --> 22:57.495
Janie: Withdrawn.

22:57.529 --> 22:58.930
I can understand
why mr. Piper

22:58.964 --> 23:00.231
Wouldn't want to answer
that question.

23:00.265 --> 23:02.400
Gag her! Counsel!

23:14.989 --> 23:16.155
In here.

23:16.190 --> 23:17.824
Look who stopped by
to see you.

23:21.028 --> 23:23.230
Megan?

23:23.264 --> 23:25.999
I -- I do remember you.
You wore clogs.

23:28.369 --> 23:32.204
I'm gonna leave
you two to catch up.

23:39.213 --> 23:41.547
Hi.
Hi.

23:41.581 --> 23:44.483
Nothing is more deadly than
a woman in a flowery sweater.

23:44.517 --> 23:46.251
Thank you.
[ chuckles ]

23:46.286 --> 23:48.987
No, I'm serious.
Flowery sweaters are a bad omen.

23:49.021 --> 23:52.857
I want to do more
than just help you, pindar.

23:52.891 --> 23:54.525
I want to fix you.

23:54.560 --> 23:55.927
[ chuckles ]

23:55.961 --> 23:57.528
Would you like to have lunch?

23:57.562 --> 23:59.297
Yeah.

23:59.331 --> 24:00.932
Like regular people.

24:00.966 --> 24:03.569
Like regular people.

24:08.008 --> 24:09.541
Winstead:
What the hell is this?

24:09.576 --> 24:11.277
<i>Are you kidding me
right now?</i>

24:11.311 --> 24:13.213
<i>I was only here
for five minutes!</i>

24:13.247 --> 24:14.947
<i>Piper! You suck!</i>

24:14.982 --> 24:16.849
<i>How about getting
a real job?</i>

24:16.884 --> 24:19.552
Take this and shove it
up your ass! You're useless!

24:19.586 --> 24:22.254
<i>Sir! I recommend that you
do not threaten me.</i>

24:22.288 --> 24:24.356
We got this footage
about 20 minutes ago.

24:24.391 --> 24:27.026
It was taken from mr. Piper's
patrol car last week,

24:27.060 --> 24:28.360
And it establishes intent.

24:28.395 --> 24:30.462
It establishes
what we already know --

24:30.497 --> 24:32.898
That tensions run
high during traffic
citations -- that's it.

24:32.932 --> 24:34.399
Your honor, are we to believe
the prosecution

24:34.434 --> 24:36.535
Just came into possession
of this tape 20 minutes ago?

24:36.569 --> 24:37.903
Really?

24:37.937 --> 24:39.505
Knowingly hiding evidence
is a felony.

24:39.539 --> 24:41.073
Are you accusing me
of a felony?

24:41.108 --> 24:42.308
No.
Yes.

24:42.343 --> 24:44.510
Your honor, in light
of this new evidence,

24:44.545 --> 24:46.613
We believe the defendant
targeted the victim,

24:46.647 --> 24:49.283
And so we'd like to amend
the charges according to proof.

24:49.351 --> 24:51.352
We are charging the defendant
with murder.

24:51.386 --> 24:53.955
No. Your honor, the d.A.
Chose what charges to file.

24:54.023 --> 24:56.391
Yeah. She was distracted
by other events in her life.

24:56.425 --> 24:57.559
Are you referring
to thailand?

24:57.593 --> 24:59.127
Thailand?
Did you tweet about it?

24:59.162 --> 25:01.464
It was an honest mistake.
It can happen to anyone.

25:01.531 --> 25:03.599
Look, bottom line is,
this is a manslaughter case.

25:03.633 --> 25:05.468
We've prepared for
a manslaughter case.

25:05.535 --> 25:08.103
She can't, in the middle of
a trial, just decide that --

25:08.138 --> 25:11.172
According to section 17b
in the penal code, she can.

25:11.206 --> 25:13.374
Judge:
Motion is granted.

25:13.409 --> 25:16.911
Murder charge is added.
Bail is remanded.

25:22.018 --> 25:23.251
Kapow.

25:27.123 --> 25:29.424
You're so loyal
to this café.

25:29.459 --> 25:31.159
I like that about you.

25:31.227 --> 25:32.494
I was a little freaked out

25:32.562 --> 25:34.630
When you first explained
your situation,

25:34.664 --> 25:36.298
But it got me thinking

25:36.333 --> 25:38.233
About how the world
can bring two people together

25:38.268 --> 25:39.935
After a decade.

25:41.470 --> 25:44.105
Your hands are soft
and cool to the touch.

25:44.139 --> 25:45.340
Thank you.

25:45.408 --> 25:46.942
Yours are scratchy.

25:46.976 --> 25:48.343
But very, very clean.

25:48.411 --> 25:49.978

25:50.012 --> 25:52.614
Don't be nervous.
You're with me.

25:52.648 --> 25:54.583
I don't deserve you.

25:54.617 --> 25:56.618
Pindar,
now that you've told me

25:56.653 --> 25:59.254
All about your phobias
and your anxiety,

25:59.289 --> 26:00.555
I think I can fix you.

26:00.590 --> 26:02.524
I can come to your house
every day

26:02.592 --> 26:04.159
And take you on field trips.

26:04.194 --> 26:06.128
I am the luckiest
o.C.D. Agoraphobe

26:06.162 --> 26:08.463
With severe and chronic anxiety
in the world.

26:08.498 --> 26:11.333
I'll have one pancake.
You know you're not
supposed to be here.

26:11.368 --> 26:14.069
I was hungry.
You're violating
your restraining order.

26:14.104 --> 26:16.239
I had to see you.
I don't feel as lucky
anymore.

26:16.273 --> 26:18.308
I'll call the police.
I like
your new haircut.

26:18.342 --> 26:20.977
Did you -- did you get that
to impress a new girlfriend?

26:21.011 --> 26:22.646
Get out, okay?
Just get out.

26:25.549 --> 26:27.250
We should go.

26:27.285 --> 26:28.518
Yeah.
Yeah.

♪ she's not just a plaything ♪

26:32.557 --> 26:34.324
This is as far as I can go.

26:34.359 --> 26:37.227
There's an open
trash receptacle over there.

26:37.295 --> 26:38.561
We're fine here.

26:38.629 --> 26:41.497
I just can't be
within 500 feet of him.

26:41.532 --> 26:43.333
This is only
about 250 feet, so --

26:43.367 --> 26:45.668
What's wrong with me?

26:47.171 --> 26:50.072
Well, maybe you want
to solve other people's problems

26:50.107 --> 26:52.141
Because your own
seem too daunting?

26:52.175 --> 26:53.509
Do you hoard?

26:53.543 --> 26:55.478
Men, maybe.

26:55.512 --> 26:58.014
I've been married twice.

26:58.048 --> 27:00.317
Also, I've slept with
a lot of guys.

27:00.352 --> 27:01.585
A lot?
A lot of guys.

27:01.619 --> 27:02.753
Like, what's that?

27:02.787 --> 27:04.522
I think I have
low self-esteem.

27:04.556 --> 27:09.427
My boss's boss is kind of like
the wizard of oz,

27:09.462 --> 27:11.663
And he has a doctor
who's gonna help me.

27:13.266 --> 27:14.734
Really?

27:14.768 --> 27:18.104
Maybe he could
help you, too?

27:18.138 --> 27:19.339
Okay.

27:19.373 --> 27:21.574
Okay.

27:26.747 --> 27:29.248
We went to bat for you.

27:29.283 --> 27:31.083
You have
to tell us everything.

27:31.118 --> 27:32.486
It had nothing to do
with the outcome.

27:32.520 --> 27:34.821
It could determine
the outcome of this trial.

27:34.855 --> 27:38.091
There were two people with
bad blood between them.

27:38.126 --> 27:39.693
One came down alive.

27:39.727 --> 27:41.729
And one of them wears a mask
and a cape

27:41.763 --> 27:44.465
And refers to his
alter ego in the third
person -- that's you.

27:44.500 --> 27:47.302
Peter: Viper, we can't afford
any more surprises.

27:47.336 --> 27:48.604
You have to walk us through

27:48.638 --> 27:50.172
Your relationship
with the purse snatcher.

27:50.240 --> 27:52.308
He was a troublemaker!
All right?

27:52.342 --> 27:53.643
And most of my student
interactions

27:53.677 --> 27:55.211
End up in conflicts.

27:55.246 --> 27:56.479
Okay.
How many in a week?

27:56.513 --> 27:57.580
I hand out parking tickets.

27:57.615 --> 27:59.282
On a typical day,

27:59.316 --> 28:01.451
I nearly come to blows
with four or five students,

28:01.485 --> 28:02.518
Most of them female.

28:04.421 --> 28:06.388
Women are generally
more strident

28:06.423 --> 28:08.524
After receiving
a parking citation.

28:12.862 --> 28:15.130
Contrary to what
you two might think,

28:15.164 --> 28:16.564
Not everyone has what it takes

28:16.599 --> 28:18.734
To be a parking-enforcement
officer,

All right?

Jared: You know
what we should have done?

28:24.908 --> 28:26.642
Wheeler motion.
Wheeler motion.

Oh, great.
Oh, this just keeps
getting better.

Hey.
Hi!

28:31.883 --> 28:33.216
What's up?

28:33.284 --> 28:34.618
Just talking
to your mom.

28:34.652 --> 28:36.887
She wants to know
if I've ever killed anyone.

28:36.922 --> 28:38.589
In the line of duty,
of course.

28:38.623 --> 28:39.790
Have you?

28:39.824 --> 28:41.425
Oh, wendy claims
that she hasn't,

28:41.459 --> 28:43.326
But it just may be too soon
for her to talk about it.

28:43.361 --> 28:44.728
No, it's just because

28:44.762 --> 28:46.663
I haven't used my firearm yet
in the field.

28:46.697 --> 28:48.764
Aw. Well, you know,
all in good time.

28:50.667 --> 28:53.268
Colleen, what do you say
we hit the jacuzzi?
Peter: Whoa!

28:53.303 --> 28:55.604
I mean
what do you say we make

28:55.638 --> 28:57.639
Some of your
famous brownies?

28:57.673 --> 28:58.840
Great idea.

There we go.

I'm sorry about this.

We can do what we want.

Not really
how I envisioned this part.

29:19.364 --> 29:20.431
Mm.

I've got
to get her out of here.

How's the viper case?

29:27.740 --> 29:29.807
Oh, no, no. Please.

29:29.842 --> 29:31.543
Don't kill the mood.

29:31.577 --> 29:32.911
We're getting pummeled.

29:32.945 --> 29:34.579
You know what I do
when I get stuck on a case?

29:34.613 --> 29:36.881
Eat a jelly doughnut
and plant evidence?

29:36.915 --> 29:38.649
[ laughs ]

29:38.684 --> 29:41.520
I slow my roll.

First, do you believe
he's innocent?

29:45.992 --> 29:47.726
I don't know.

29:47.760 --> 29:51.596
I mean, he honestly thinks
he's making the city safer.

29:51.630 --> 29:53.230
How can you not love a guy
who thinks

29:53.265 --> 29:54.932
He can leap a tall building
in a single bound?

29:54.966 --> 29:56.801
Except he can't.

29:56.835 --> 29:58.670
Yeah.

29:58.704 --> 30:00.271
I guess.

30:05.779 --> 30:07.280
What's wrong?

30:07.314 --> 30:08.915
Nothing. Nothing.

30:09.483 --> 30:11.752
Mmm.

30:15.591 --> 30:17.291
You need to talk to jared.

30:17.325 --> 30:18.592
I'm sorry.

30:18.626 --> 30:21.862
I promise this will happen.

Mwah.

30:23.665 --> 30:26.301

30:26.335 --> 30:29.804
So, this is right above
the stoner's apartment.

30:29.839 --> 30:32.574
Maybe the victim wasn't
the only one who flew
off that building.

30:32.608 --> 30:34.876
You think viper did?

30:34.911 --> 30:37.913
Yeah. I think he jumped off
that building,

30:37.947 --> 30:39.948
Landed on this roof,

30:39.983 --> 30:43.351
And that was the thud
that the stoner heard.

30:45.021 --> 30:47.822
Is that viper's cape?

30:47.857 --> 30:50.625
Let me call it in
and make it admissible.

30:52.295 --> 30:56.264
Why would he be on this roof
if the victim was on that one?

30:56.298 --> 30:57.732
This didn't go down
the way viper said.

up on that roof?

I couldn't have been
more clear.

31:13.909 --> 31:15.543
That's my story.

31:15.577 --> 31:18.146
Okay. Your story
could send you to prison.

31:18.180 --> 31:20.181
We also have a pretty tough case
on our hands.

31:20.216 --> 31:21.816
You admitted
you tried to vanquish him,

31:21.850 --> 31:23.552
So now they've got you
on intent.

31:33.496 --> 31:35.497
Viper, we're gonna put you
on the stand again.

31:37.767 --> 31:39.868
What for?

31:41.271 --> 31:43.239
To tell your story.

31:47.378 --> 31:49.379
Very well.

31:51.983 --> 31:55.353
Dude, why'd you stop me?
We have proof of what happened.

31:55.388 --> 31:56.922
We don't have proof
that supports his version.

31:56.956 --> 31:59.925
I know. That's why we have to
prove that viper's human.

31:59.959 --> 32:02.628
You're gonna break his heart,

to colleen about it.

to exercise his rights.
