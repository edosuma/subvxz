WEBVTT

00:01.877 --> 00:03.754
Previously on 90210...
You signed a contract,

00:03.796 --> 00:06.047
which gives me full control
of your music. I own you.

00:06.089 --> 00:07.716
I will do whatever
it takes to get

00:07.758 --> 00:09.718
out of your contract
and out of your life.

00:09.760 --> 00:11.345
SILVER: Dr. Sukaly,
I got my donor's signature

00:11.386 --> 00:13.180
giving up his paternal rights.

00:13.221 --> 00:14.222
I really need to
get my forms back.

00:14.264 --> 00:15.140
I realized I made a mistake.

00:15.182 --> 00:16.308
That's why we
called the donor.

00:16.350 --> 00:18.477
You forged my signature?

00:18.519 --> 00:20.813
Teddy, I can explain.
No... you can't.

00:20.855 --> 00:22.147
Campbell Price.
Hey, this is Navid Shirazi.

00:22.189 --> 00:23.983
Hey, I'm head
at Cronus now.

00:24.023 --> 00:26.360
Cronus Society? Well, that's
that secret elite group...

00:26.401 --> 00:27.945
With a bunch of douchey guys
using their connections

00:27.987 --> 00:29.446
to get ahead.
That's exactly what I need.

00:29.488 --> 00:30.531
You'll be
traveling in this.

00:30.572 --> 00:32.323
Gonna put me in a box?

00:32.366 --> 00:33.742
ASHLEY: If you won't let me
protect you,

00:33.784 --> 00:35.619
you leave me no other choice.
No!

00:35.661 --> 00:36.620
(gunshot)

00:36.662 --> 00:38.539
(gasping)

00:38.580 --> 00:39.540
Had a rough
couple of days.

00:39.581 --> 00:40.833
I'm just trying to
work off some stress.

00:40.875 --> 00:41.959
I heard clubs like yours

00:42.001 --> 00:43.752
usually have
some kind of initiation.

00:43.794 --> 00:45.086
(crowd cheering)

00:45.128 --> 00:46.672
Who's next?

00:46.714 --> 00:48.924
I'm sick and tired
of thinking

00:48.966 --> 00:50.342
about what Max wants.

00:50.384 --> 00:52.594
I want to go to Tokyo,
and I want

00:52.636 --> 00:53.804
to be a princess!

00:53.846 --> 00:54.847
MAX:
I guess you should go.

00:54.889 --> 00:56.932
Dr. Bronson, I changed my mind.

00:56.974 --> 00:58.767
I want to go through with
the spinal surgery.

00:58.809 --> 01:01.478
Late this afternoon, a clot
traveled to Riley's lungs.

01:01.520 --> 01:02.855
What's going on?

01:02.897 --> 01:05.357
Riley-- he's dead.

01:07.568 --> 01:09.987
Liam! What's up, champ?!

01:10.029 --> 01:11.279
Yo, Navid, what's up?

01:11.321 --> 01:13.365
The Cronus guys want
another fight.

01:13.407 --> 01:15.242
Hey, keep it down, man.

01:15.283 --> 01:17.036
You want to advertise it
to the whole campus?

01:17.077 --> 01:18.537
Sorry, I just
got excited.

01:18.579 --> 01:20.039
Hey, we can't break
into the gym again,

01:20.080 --> 01:21.749
so we need to
find a new place.

01:21.790 --> 01:22.917
They're really
into us, man.

01:22.958 --> 01:25.252
Navid, it's some
stupid secret club.

01:25.293 --> 01:26.336
Who cares what they're into?

01:26.378 --> 01:27.755
Hey, these people
have connections;

01:27.796 --> 01:28.756
they can open doors.

01:28.797 --> 01:29.924
I can open my own doors.

01:29.965 --> 01:30.966
Dude, come on, don't
leave me hanging.

01:31.008 --> 01:32.342
You started the
whole fight thing.

01:32.384 --> 01:35.345
They way you threw down, hey,
you were like a madman.

01:35.387 --> 01:36.764
I'm not a madman.

01:36.805 --> 01:39.892
And I'm not some sideshow
for your new fake friends.

01:39.934 --> 01:41.268
So, what, you're just
gonna bail on me?

01:41.309 --> 01:42.937
Yeah, pretty much.

01:42.978 --> 01:45.188
Navid, I got to go.
I've got a meeting

01:45.230 --> 01:46.815
with a director
who's been hounding me.

01:46.857 --> 01:48.149
Uh, I thought you quit
the whole acting thing.

01:48.191 --> 01:49.944
I don't know
what I'm doing, okay?

01:53.363 --> 01:56.241
Look, the fight
served its purpose.

01:56.283 --> 01:57.868
It was fun
knocking around those guys.

01:57.910 --> 02:01.997
But I got to, I got to find
a new way to channel my energy.

02:03.999 --> 02:05.584
Great.

02:05.626 --> 02:08.127
NAOMI:
Uh, this one's yours.

02:08.169 --> 02:10.047
I think I'm
gonna keep it.

02:10.089 --> 02:11.506
Yeah, sure.

02:11.548 --> 02:13.592
I always loved it
when you wore my shirts.

02:13.634 --> 02:14.593
So, uh...

02:14.635 --> 02:16.887
Intimate.

02:16.929 --> 02:21.016
Yeah, and... you looked
really damn sexy in them.

02:22.017 --> 02:23.852
No sad faces.

02:23.894 --> 02:25.938
Divorce sucks, but
it's the right thing.

02:25.980 --> 02:27.689
Yeah, no, it is;
we're too young.

02:27.731 --> 02:29.984
Yeah, and we're
too impulsive.

02:30.025 --> 02:32.277
Getting married like that
was so Britney Spears.

02:32.319 --> 02:34.446
(sighs) They only way
we're gonna thrive

02:34.488 --> 02:35.823
is if we're apart.

02:35.864 --> 02:37.157
And while we're
dividing our assets,

02:37.198 --> 02:38.700
we should actually go
over our calendars.

02:38.742 --> 02:40.285
I think there's a
lot of things that

02:40.327 --> 02:41.745
we have committed
to do together.
Okay.

02:41.787 --> 02:44.456
Um... okay.

02:44.498 --> 02:47.668
This weekend is...

02:47.709 --> 02:49.878
the After-School
Achievers event.

02:49.920 --> 02:51.005
I'll let you
take that one.

02:51.046 --> 02:53.132
What? Why would
you do that?

02:53.172 --> 02:54.633
I mean, you're the
one who's into

02:54.675 --> 02:55.801
raising money for
after-school programs.

02:55.843 --> 02:57.511
But you did
all the planning for it.

02:57.552 --> 02:59.178
I mean,
getting Ade to sing,

02:59.220 --> 03:00.555
and putting Liam
in the football scrimmage.

03:00.597 --> 03:03.809
Yeah, I guess it sounds like
it's our charity event.

03:03.851 --> 03:06.185
Yeah, but...

03:06.227 --> 03:08.939
we both also know
that we need a clean break.

03:08.981 --> 03:10.816
Right?

03:10.858 --> 03:12.067
Yeah, no, absolutely.

03:12.109 --> 03:13.568
It's over; why should we linger?

03:13.610 --> 03:14.695
(chuckles)

03:14.736 --> 03:17.906
Okay, I will do the
charity event on my own.

03:17.948 --> 03:21.409
And, as I always say,
no wallowing.

03:22.577 --> 03:24.621
DIXON:
Ade thinks I played her,

03:24.663 --> 03:28.000
but I really didn't mean it
like that, man.

03:28.042 --> 03:29.376
Using the money from Ade's gig

03:29.417 --> 03:31.086
to pay for Megan's scholarship
was pretty cold.

03:31.128 --> 03:33.839
Well, no good deed
goes unpunished, right?

03:33.881 --> 03:36.257
Megan dumped me
and Ade hates me.

03:36.299 --> 03:38.426
Why don't you let Ade
out of her contract?

03:38.468 --> 03:40.929
Dude, I got calls out
to everybody I know

03:40.971 --> 03:42.890
in the music business
just to try to

03:42.931 --> 03:44.058
get my label started.

03:44.099 --> 03:45.642
And, right now,
Ade is my only asset.

03:45.684 --> 03:47.435
It's like I'm hanging
by a thread here.

03:47.477 --> 03:49.188
Yeah, tell me about it.

03:49.229 --> 03:51.398
Feel like my only asset
to the guys in the club

03:51.439 --> 03:52.649
is that I'm friends with Liam.

03:52.691 --> 03:55.443
Liam? That's what
you have to offer?

03:55.485 --> 03:57.071
Liam? I mean...

03:57.112 --> 04:00.490
No offense or anything,
but... that's kind of sad.

04:00.532 --> 04:02.117
I have plenty of stuff to offer.

04:02.159 --> 04:04.578
Okay, so then stop whining
about Liam and show them.

04:05.829 --> 04:06.872
(sighs)

04:10.042 --> 04:11.793
So, just to be up front,
I'm not even sure

04:11.835 --> 04:12.961
I want to do
another movie.

04:13.003 --> 04:14.504
I just kind of fell
into the acting thing.

04:14.546 --> 04:16.505
Oh, come on.
Look what you've been in.

04:16.548 --> 04:17.632
Corporate Invaders?

04:17.673 --> 04:19.093
It's not exactly high art.

04:19.134 --> 04:21.344
Or even low art.

04:21.386 --> 04:22.679
Or art adjacent.

04:22.721 --> 04:23.889
(both laugh)

04:23.931 --> 04:25.140
Well, to be perfectly honest,

04:25.182 --> 04:27.184
you were not the first person
I thought of

04:27.226 --> 04:28.435
to play Joe Namath.

04:28.476 --> 04:30.395
But I'm on the board of
After-School Achievers.

04:30.437 --> 04:32.313
Oh, yeah? My friend
Naomi's running that event.

04:32.355 --> 04:33.982
When I heard
that you were playing

04:34.024 --> 04:36.317
in the celebrity football game,
I started thinking about you.

04:36.359 --> 04:38.528
And the more I thought,
the better the idea seemed.

04:38.570 --> 04:42.616
Well, Joe Namath does have more
appeal than alien invaders.

04:42.657 --> 04:43.909
And I can throw
a football.

04:43.951 --> 04:45.326
I guess I'll see you
at the event.

04:45.368 --> 04:46.703
(quietly):
Yeah.

04:46.745 --> 04:48.205
I'm gonna have to
get you approved

04:48.247 --> 04:50.457
by the studio,
but if you want this,

04:50.498 --> 04:52.042
you got a real shot.

04:52.084 --> 04:54.253
(sighs):
Wow.

04:54.294 --> 04:57.881
Um, well, I'm... I'm
glad you thought of me.

04:57.923 --> 04:59.591
I just need to take some
time to think it over,

04:59.633 --> 05:00.968
make sure it's
really what I want.

05:01.009 --> 05:03.344
Read the script.

05:03.386 --> 05:05.013
You'll want it.

05:10.894 --> 05:12.146
NAOMI (sighs):
Annie, I'm so happy

05:12.187 --> 05:13.688
to see you out
of the house.

05:13.730 --> 05:15.690
Honey, retail therapy
is very helpful.

05:15.732 --> 05:16.984
Yeah, nothing like
a good shoe clearance

05:17.025 --> 05:18.735
to make me forget all about
my poor, dead boyfriend.

05:18.777 --> 05:20.195
Oh.

05:20.237 --> 05:22.114
Trying a new approach:
gallows humor.

05:22.156 --> 05:23.323
So not working.
(laughs)

05:23.364 --> 05:24.992
Well, we're
here for you.

05:25.033 --> 05:27.077
Yeah, I'm free tonight,
if you want to hang out.

05:27.119 --> 05:29.412
We can read my medical
report and have a good cry.

05:29.454 --> 05:31.039
(laughs)

05:31.081 --> 05:33.416
Well, you guys are sweet,
but I'm fine.

05:33.458 --> 05:34.668
Really, I am.

05:34.709 --> 05:37.087
I'm just processing still,
trying not to dwell,

05:37.129 --> 05:38.713
and doing a
lot of writing.

05:38.755 --> 05:40.465
I write songs when I'm going
through a tough time.

05:40.507 --> 05:42.301
Ooh, when do we get to read?

05:42.341 --> 05:43.927
Please tell me
it's not poetry slam.

05:43.969 --> 05:47.055
Ha! I bet it's nothing
that embarrassing.

05:47.097 --> 05:48.515
Of course not.

05:48.556 --> 05:50.267
Okay, these pants are
cut to practically

05:50.309 --> 05:51.392
guarantee camel toe.

05:51.434 --> 05:53.520
She'll take one
in every color.

05:53.561 --> 05:56.648
NAOMI (sighs):
Girls, does this say

05:56.690 --> 05:58.399
"sexy yet charitable"?

05:58.441 --> 06:00.443
SILVER: More like
sidewalk sale in Palmdale.

06:00.485 --> 06:02.904
Oh, my God, everyone's so
bitchy today. I love it.

06:02.946 --> 06:04.156
(sighs)

06:04.198 --> 06:05.907
So, guys, this charity
thing was Max's idea,

06:05.949 --> 06:07.326
and now he's
not coming.

06:07.366 --> 06:08.367
Why not?

06:08.409 --> 06:09.995
He wants a clean break.

06:10.037 --> 06:11.412
We have a mutual,
friendly separation,

06:11.454 --> 06:13.790
and I don't understand
why we just can't be friends.

06:13.832 --> 06:15.083
Well, give it
a little time.

06:15.125 --> 06:16.918
When Liam and I broke up,
we weren't exactly friends,

06:16.960 --> 06:18.045
and now we're roommates.

06:18.086 --> 06:19.254
Yeah, no, I know.

06:19.296 --> 06:20.797
I just don't like the idea
that divorce means

06:20.839 --> 06:22.507
we have to be out of
each other's lives forever.

06:22.549 --> 06:23.842
(scoffs) I want to be
out of Dixon's life forever.

06:23.884 --> 06:25.052
I don't know
what it's gonna take

06:25.093 --> 06:27.095
for him to let me
out of my contract.

06:27.137 --> 06:28.805
Just be glad you're not
having a baby with your ex.

06:28.847 --> 06:32.559
Oh, wait, that's right,
neither am I.

06:32.600 --> 06:36.355
Teddy has decided that I'm not
fit to carry my own baby,

06:36.395 --> 06:39.274
so I either have
to get a surrogate

06:39.316 --> 06:41.235
or put my embryos
back into cold storage.

06:41.276 --> 06:43.320
Okay, Teddy's a jerk.

06:43.362 --> 06:45.822
But, you know what, you can
have someone else do it

06:45.864 --> 06:47.406
and keep your
beautiful body.
Yeah.

06:47.448 --> 06:48.742
Sorry, Ade.

06:48.783 --> 06:49.951
No, you're right.

06:49.993 --> 06:51.578
It wasn't a
walk in the park.

06:51.619 --> 06:54.581
Okay, sad talk is
making me exhausted.

06:54.622 --> 06:55.707
Let's go get coffee.

06:55.749 --> 06:57.042
Or antidepressants?
Let's go.

06:57.084 --> 06:59.044
Naomi's buying.

06:59.086 --> 07:02.214
Um, you guys go.
I'm gonna catch up.

07:08.511 --> 07:12.224
(alarm beeping)

07:15.394 --> 07:18.646
(theme music playing)

07:33.828 --> 07:34.913
(sighs)

07:34.955 --> 07:36.373
What the hell is
wrong with you?

07:36.415 --> 07:37.416
I wanted a dress,

07:37.457 --> 07:38.375
and various other things.

07:38.417 --> 07:39.876
Why do you even care?

07:39.918 --> 07:41.628
'Cause it makes you look
like some trashy, washed-up

07:41.669 --> 07:43.671
Lohan mess. And makes me
look like a bottom feeder.

07:43.713 --> 07:45.215
Really?
Then you should tear up

07:45.257 --> 07:46.716
my contract
and protect yourself.

07:46.758 --> 07:48.260
Nice try, okay?

07:48.302 --> 07:50.137
I already talked to
the store, and they're

07:50.178 --> 07:51.846
dropping the charges
and keeping quiet.

07:51.888 --> 07:54.224
This is staying out
of the tabloids.

07:54.266 --> 07:55.976
You just take care of
everything, don't you?

07:56.017 --> 07:57.102
(clears throat)

07:57.144 --> 07:58.478
Okay, Ade, look, I get that

07:58.519 --> 07:59.771
our professional relationship
isn't working.

07:59.813 --> 08:01.689
I get that, okay?

08:01.731 --> 08:03.191
But do you think this is the
smartest way of dealing with it?

08:03.233 --> 08:04.901
I'll pretty much
try anything, Dixon.

08:04.943 --> 08:06.069
You got to have a little faith!

08:06.111 --> 08:07.237
Okay, well, I used
the last of that

08:07.279 --> 08:08.488
when I agreed to
sell myself out

08:08.529 --> 08:10.324
for your little trucker
girl's tuition money.

08:10.365 --> 08:12.617
And I promise, I will
make that up to you.

08:12.659 --> 08:14.202
You have my word, okay?

08:14.244 --> 08:16.204
But you have to
give me a chance.
How?

08:16.246 --> 08:19.666
Look, I'm working
on something, okay?

08:19.707 --> 08:22.002
And if it happens,
we'll both be out of this

08:22.043 --> 08:23.170
with what we want.

08:26.881 --> 08:30.551
Thank you so much.
We'll be in touch.

08:30.593 --> 08:33.263
She's your idea of a surrogate?
Are you kidding me?

08:33.304 --> 08:34.264
Pretentious accent, man.

08:34.306 --> 08:35.474
She studied
at Oxford.

08:35.515 --> 08:36.850
She grew up
in Tarzana.

08:36.890 --> 08:38.852
(sighs) Silver, you're being
arbitrary and stalling.

08:38.893 --> 08:40.602
I thought you wanted
this to happen.

08:40.645 --> 08:42.230
I do want this to happen.

08:42.272 --> 08:44.691
I just don't want my baby--
excuse me, our baby--

08:44.732 --> 08:46.109
being carried by someone
who I would

08:46.151 --> 08:47.361
cross the street
just to avoid.

08:47.402 --> 08:48.820
But you haven't
liked any of them.

08:48.862 --> 08:50.030
My child is gonna
be inside another

08:50.071 --> 08:51.739
woman's body
for nine months, okay?

08:51.781 --> 08:53.741
I want to have a personal
connection with that person.

08:53.783 --> 08:55.869
And I want them to
have a good heart.

08:55.910 --> 08:56.953
Okay, there is one
other candidate.

08:56.995 --> 08:58.121
I didn't bring her up

08:58.163 --> 08:59.873
because I didn't
think you'd like her.

08:59.914 --> 09:01.875
Shane has a sister.
Pass.

09:01.916 --> 09:03.460
She's great. And she has
a ton of student debt,

09:03.502 --> 09:05.212
so this would be a great way
for her to earn some money.

09:05.253 --> 09:06.921
Where is she at school?

09:06.963 --> 09:08.715
American University.

09:08.756 --> 09:10.591
In D.C.? Are you kidding me?

09:10.633 --> 09:13.428
Teddy, how am I
supposed to have a personal

09:13.470 --> 09:15.389
relationship with someone who
doesn't even live out here?

09:15.430 --> 09:17.765
She loves L.A., and she comes
and visits all the time.

09:17.807 --> 09:18.933
You could visit D.C.

09:18.975 --> 09:20.060
I mean, she's
everything you want.

09:20.101 --> 09:21.769
What I want is
someone who is neutral.

09:21.811 --> 09:22.854
Not someone who's on your team.

09:22.896 --> 09:24.356
What are you talking about?

09:24.398 --> 09:26.733
Silver, we're on the same team.
We want the same thing.

09:26.774 --> 09:28.651
Sure we do.

09:28.693 --> 09:31.571
Look, I have to go
back to D.C.

09:31.612 --> 09:33.740
So I'm gonna be there
for at least six months,

09:33.781 --> 09:35.158
so unless we
find someone now,

09:35.200 --> 09:36.451
we're gonna
have to wait.

09:36.493 --> 09:38.370
Teddy, I'm not
gonna wait six months.

09:38.412 --> 09:41.581
Then at least
meet her, okay?

09:41.622 --> 09:44.376
She's in town for a week.

09:46.420 --> 09:49.381
(door opens, closes)

09:51.925 --> 09:53.510
Oh, see?

09:53.552 --> 09:56.555
There's the last box
of stuff that you forgot.

09:56.596 --> 09:59.266
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
What is this?

09:59.307 --> 10:02.727
Oh, silly me, I must have
grabbed the wrong box.

10:02.769 --> 10:04.438
This is the one for
the mad scientist guy

10:04.479 --> 10:05.439
for the After-School
Achievers event.

10:05.480 --> 10:06.731
The one you
were gonna do.

10:06.773 --> 10:07.774
Let me take a look.

10:07.815 --> 10:09.276
Let me guess, the guy

10:09.317 --> 10:11.111
you were gonna replace me with
dropped out?

10:11.152 --> 10:13.363
No, he was six-foot-four
and looked like a felon.

10:13.405 --> 10:15.865
I had to let him go because he
was too scary for the kids.

10:15.907 --> 10:17.409
What?
What a shame.

10:17.451 --> 10:19.327
(laughs)

10:19.369 --> 10:21.455
Yeah, I mean, I have
been having difficulty

10:21.496 --> 10:22.663
trying to replace him.

10:22.705 --> 10:24.458
I mean, it's really hard
trying to find someone

10:24.499 --> 10:26.084
who's sweet and
unthreatening enough...

10:26.126 --> 10:28.169
To be a mad scientist, yeah.

10:28.211 --> 10:32.299
To be a cute
mad scientist.

10:32.340 --> 10:35.427
Of all the times that
you have tried to manipulate me

10:35.469 --> 10:39.639
with flattery, this is
by far the worst attempt.

10:39.680 --> 10:41.558
Yeah, okay, we had
a clean break.

10:41.600 --> 10:42.642
I'm out of practice.

10:42.683 --> 10:43.935
Come on, Max.

10:43.977 --> 10:46.104
This was your
event to begin with.

10:46.146 --> 10:47.772
And we can do a much
better job together.

10:47.814 --> 10:49.357
Mm-hmm.

10:49.399 --> 10:51.192
Max, I'm okay with
us getting a divorce

10:51.234 --> 10:52.235
and you going to MIT.

10:52.277 --> 10:54.028
I'm just not ready
for us to be

10:54.070 --> 10:55.530
out of each other's
lives forever.

10:55.572 --> 10:57.449
Can we just
be friends?

10:57.491 --> 11:00.034
Or at least perform
science experiments

11:00.076 --> 11:02.537
in front of large
crowds together?

11:03.746 --> 11:05.582
Fine. Fine.
(laughs)

11:05.624 --> 11:08.126
Let's go shop for
scary chemicals.

11:08.168 --> 11:09.794
See? This will be great.

11:09.836 --> 11:11.505
(laughs)

11:15.258 --> 11:18.345
♪ ♪

11:18.386 --> 11:20.430
It's a good call, Shirazi.

11:20.472 --> 11:22.265
This place has some
major eye candy.

11:22.307 --> 11:24.267
Hey, just trying
to mix it up. Cheers.

11:24.309 --> 11:25.519
Cheers, man.

11:25.560 --> 11:26.436
Keep it coming.

11:26.478 --> 11:28.062
Fight night was awesome.
Right?

11:28.104 --> 11:29.063
Yes.
Yes.

11:29.105 --> 11:30.315
When is the next one?

11:30.357 --> 11:31.399
Mm, and where?

11:31.441 --> 11:32.567
Because word is
getting around.

11:32.609 --> 11:33.692
We need a bigger place.

11:33.734 --> 11:34.902
And you got
to bring Liam.

11:34.944 --> 11:36.112
Where's he been, anyway?

11:36.154 --> 11:37.905
Oh, I already
found us a place.

11:37.947 --> 11:38.865
Yeah? Where?

11:38.906 --> 11:40.116
Uh, Shirazi Studios.

11:40.158 --> 11:42.827
My family, they own this, uh,
whole sound stage.

11:42.869 --> 11:43.911
It's tons of space.

11:43.953 --> 11:45.330
She totally wants me.

11:46.998 --> 11:48.082
I'd give her a ride.

11:48.124 --> 11:50.751
Oh, yeah, man,
me, too.

11:50.793 --> 11:52.045
Wherever she needs to go.

11:52.086 --> 11:53.213
(laughter)
Oh, yeah?

11:53.254 --> 11:54.713
Big man on campus, huh?
Yeah, the biggest.

11:54.755 --> 11:56.757
I don't think you got
the cojones to go for it.

11:56.799 --> 11:58.968
Sure do.

11:59.010 --> 11:59.927
Cojones grande.

11:59.969 --> 12:01.929
(laughter)

12:04.641 --> 12:06.351
Yeah, I will.
Nice night.

12:06.393 --> 12:08.061
Uh, hi.

12:08.102 --> 12:09.770
Excuse me. Uh, hi.

12:09.812 --> 12:10.855
I'm Navid.

12:10.897 --> 12:12.691
Yeah, nice night.

12:12.731 --> 12:15.402
Yeah. Uh, okay,
so listen,

12:15.443 --> 12:17.445
you are awesomely
attractive.

12:17.487 --> 12:19.738
But-but I'm not trying
to pick you up.

12:19.780 --> 12:20.990
Oh, you're-you're not?

12:21.032 --> 12:24.703
No, uh, well, I mean,
unless you're open to it.

12:24.743 --> 12:27.205
How could I not be?
You're irresistibly smooth.

12:27.247 --> 12:28.998
Oh, thank you.

12:29.040 --> 12:30.709
(both laugh)

12:30.749 --> 12:32.544
Uh, well, here's the thing:

12:32.586 --> 12:34.795
um, these guys that
I'm with, uh, I'm really

12:34.837 --> 12:37.131
trying to impress
them, and so, uh--

12:37.173 --> 12:39.008
yeah, I know
it's lame--

12:39.050 --> 12:42.220
but if I hand you my phone,
can you just dial some numbers?

12:42.262 --> 12:44.097
No, it doesn't have to
be your real number.

12:44.138 --> 12:45.640
Uh, I just...

12:49.977 --> 12:51.062
Uh... thanks.

12:51.104 --> 12:53.273
Appreciate it.

12:53.314 --> 12:55.358
Any chance it's
your real number?

12:58.612 --> 13:00.655
My phone's in my purse.

13:00.697 --> 13:02.407
Why don't you come
to my table,

13:02.449 --> 13:04.200
we can see if it's ringing.

13:05.826 --> 13:07.579
Love that.

13:09.289 --> 13:10.498
(whispers):
What?

13:26.222 --> 13:28.224
Hey, how long has that
gray car been outside?

13:28.266 --> 13:29.684
Huh? What car?

13:29.726 --> 13:31.227
The one with the guy
sitting in it.

13:31.269 --> 13:33.187
The... some stalker,
paparazzo, for all we know.

13:33.229 --> 13:35.440
Liam, we're in a really
nice neighborhood.

13:35.482 --> 13:37.442
People are just
walking and biking

13:37.484 --> 13:39.319
and coming and going and
sitting in their cars.

13:39.360 --> 13:40.528
Don't be all jumpy.

13:40.570 --> 13:41.780
Me, jumpy?

13:41.820 --> 13:43.906
You almost flew across the room
when I opened the door.

13:43.948 --> 13:45.866
I was deep in thought.

13:45.908 --> 13:46.867
Anyway, that
director called

13:46.909 --> 13:48.161
looking for you,
like, three times.

13:48.202 --> 13:50.330
You know, she won
an Oscar last year.

13:50.371 --> 13:52.582
You might want to think
about returning the call.

13:52.624 --> 13:53.792
And reading the script.

13:53.832 --> 13:55.669
Yes, okay, I will.

13:55.710 --> 13:57.420
When I get the time.

13:57.462 --> 13:59.922
What exactly is it that
you're so busy doing?

13:59.964 --> 14:01.633
You know, besides
sneaking out at night.

14:01.675 --> 14:03.468
You know what, Annie,
we're roommates.

14:03.510 --> 14:05.886
As in, separate lives.
We can come and go as we please.

14:05.928 --> 14:06.887
There's no sneaking.

14:06.929 --> 14:08.055
It's just, I know you.

14:08.097 --> 14:09.557
And I know when
something's not right.

14:09.599 --> 14:11.392
(sighs) You know what,
I'm going for a walk.

14:28.493 --> 14:30.495
Hey! What are you doing?

14:30.537 --> 14:32.288
Looking for someone.
What's it to you?

14:32.330 --> 14:34.957
Liam! Liam! Oh, my God!

14:34.999 --> 14:36.584
What the hell is
wrong with you?!

14:36.626 --> 14:37.877
Get away from
my house, huh?!

14:37.918 --> 14:39.253
Let him go!

14:46.803 --> 14:49.096
Here you go.
I'll just be a minute.

14:50.640 --> 14:53.267
What is wrong with you?
You have a problem.

14:53.309 --> 14:55.269
Why? 'Cause I freak out
a little bit

14:55.311 --> 14:56.771
when there's a stalker
outside my house?

14:56.813 --> 14:59.440
He's not a stalker, he's
just looking for someone.

14:59.482 --> 15:01.192
You better hope
it's not a lawyer.

15:01.234 --> 15:02.736
You are too trusting, Annie.

15:02.777 --> 15:03.903
Liam, I get it, okay?

15:03.944 --> 15:04.904
I was there, too.

15:04.945 --> 15:05.988
I got shot, remember?

15:06.030 --> 15:09.116
But we have to let
it go and move on.

15:09.158 --> 15:11.911
Not hold it in and
freak out every time...

15:11.952 --> 15:12.829
Where are you going?

15:12.871 --> 15:14.581
I'm moving on
with my life, Annie,

15:14.622 --> 15:16.082
as if nothing
ever happened.

15:18.543 --> 15:20.253
I-I don't know.
Maybe you're right.

15:20.294 --> 15:22.255
Maybe I just need
something to do.

15:22.296 --> 15:23.381
Maybe it's this movie.

15:23.423 --> 15:24.674
Who the hell knows?

15:27.927 --> 15:29.262
(sighs)

15:32.348 --> 15:34.225
(sighs)
Are you okay?

15:34.267 --> 15:35.602
I'm sorry
about my roommate.

15:35.643 --> 15:36.977
Uh, fine.
No worries.

15:37.019 --> 15:39.439
I'm Kent.
Annie.

15:39.480 --> 15:40.815
So, who are you
looking for, anyway?

15:40.857 --> 15:42.191
I'm looking
for a blogger.

15:42.233 --> 15:43.526
Or at least
my boss is.

15:43.568 --> 15:46.070
A girl who writes
something called Undressed.

15:47.739 --> 15:49.365
You said your
name is Annie.

15:49.407 --> 15:50.909
Just like Annabelle
from the blog?

15:53.035 --> 15:54.995
I work with Amanda Barnard--
Armitage Books.

15:55.037 --> 15:56.915
She loves your writing,
and is prepared to come

15:56.956 --> 15:58.583
out from New York
to meet with you.

15:58.625 --> 15:59.626
How did you find me?

15:59.667 --> 16:01.252
We tried contacting you
through your blog,

16:01.294 --> 16:03.003
but, uh, you didn't answer.

16:03.045 --> 16:05.214
And, well, it turns out
that some of our interns

16:05.256 --> 16:06.966
are very good at
tracking down IP addresses.

16:07.007 --> 16:08.635
And invading people's privacy?

16:08.676 --> 16:11.011
You should take this as a
huge compliment, Annie.

16:11.053 --> 16:12.555
Armitage loves
your candor.

16:12.597 --> 16:15.349
Like Amanda says,
writing about sex is easy.

16:15.391 --> 16:17.351
It's the pathos that
we're drawn to.

16:17.393 --> 16:20.020
Well, my pathos is personal,
so if you'll excuse me...

16:20.062 --> 16:21.481
You should give
it some thought.

16:21.522 --> 16:23.483
At least meet
with Amanda?

16:23.524 --> 16:26.945
She says your blog could be
the next Fifty Shades of Grey.

16:29.155 --> 16:30.239
Thanks.

16:39.833 --> 16:41.835
I get it, Dixon;
you're a startup operation,

16:41.876 --> 16:42.919
you got one artist.

16:42.961 --> 16:44.044
And I need a break.

16:44.086 --> 16:46.172
See the videos I sent
you of Adrianna?

16:46.213 --> 16:47.214
I did.

16:47.256 --> 16:48.341
You play that thing right,

16:48.382 --> 16:49.926
you got a gold mine
on your hands.

16:49.968 --> 16:52.136
Yeah, well, uh,
how would you like

16:52.178 --> 16:53.554
a key to that
gold mine?

16:53.596 --> 16:54.639
Talk to me.

16:54.681 --> 16:56.724
Look, Adrianna's come
a long way, okay,

16:56.766 --> 16:58.601
but it's rough
working with an ex, man.

16:58.643 --> 17:00.186
Been there a few times myself.

17:00.227 --> 17:03.063
Yeah, so, uh, how
would you like to

17:03.105 --> 17:04.315
take over her contract?

17:04.357 --> 17:06.733
Uh, I'm sure
I couldn't afford

17:06.776 --> 17:08.068
what you're
probably asking for.

17:08.109 --> 17:09.487
No, no, no, I'm
sure you could.

17:09.529 --> 17:11.489
Just, uh, send me a few of
your other artists--

17:11.531 --> 17:13.867
less established or not--
and we'll call it even.

17:13.907 --> 17:15.201
You trust
my judgment with that?

17:15.242 --> 17:16.703
You trust mine
with Adrianna?

17:16.743 --> 17:18.954
Look, I like what you've
done with her image,

17:18.997 --> 17:21.415
and seems like she's
really cleaned up her act,

17:21.457 --> 17:24.042
but my partners are
gonna have to see

17:24.084 --> 17:25.837
Adrianna gig somewhere
before they sign off.

17:25.878 --> 17:28.297
Well, Adrianna's doing a
charity event in a couple days.

17:28.339 --> 17:30.299
Perfect.
I'll bring my people,

17:30.341 --> 17:32.468
and if all goes well,
you got a deal.

17:32.510 --> 17:34.721
Cheers?
Salud.

17:34.762 --> 17:36.723
ADRIANNA: I thought
the shoplifting thing

17:36.764 --> 17:38.850
would do the trick,
but it didn't work.

17:38.892 --> 17:41.310
Dixon's all over me
about this charity event.

17:41.352 --> 17:42.979
What I should sing,
what I should wear.

17:43.021 --> 17:44.898
Maybe you should just
suck it up and get through it.

17:44.939 --> 17:46.065
I can't, okay?

17:46.106 --> 17:47.400
I hate being
told what to do.

17:47.441 --> 17:49.109
Especially by his
big, round baby face.

17:49.151 --> 17:51.863
Okay, don't let
your anger spiral, Ade.

17:51.905 --> 17:53.698
Like I should talk.
I've been so pissed at Teddy.

17:53.740 --> 17:55.742
Okay, Teddy isn't
lording his power over you

17:55.783 --> 17:57.368
the way Dixon
is with me.

17:57.410 --> 17:58.745
Are you kidding?

17:58.786 --> 18:00.747
He's trying to make me use
Shane's sister as our surrogate.

18:00.788 --> 18:02.122
Wait, Shane
has a sister?

18:02.164 --> 18:03.290
Exactly!

18:03.332 --> 18:04.542
I've never heard
of her either.

18:04.584 --> 18:06.126
Now he's trying to
jam her down my throat.

18:06.168 --> 18:09.797
"Rand Gunn is coming tomorrow.
Time to step it up, Ade. D."

18:09.839 --> 18:11.007
Unbelievable.

18:11.049 --> 18:12.008
Who's Rand Gunn?

18:12.050 --> 18:13.384
I don't know,
probably some manager.

18:13.426 --> 18:15.428
I'm sure Dixon's trying
to package me on a tour

18:15.469 --> 18:16.470
with some of his artists.

18:16.512 --> 18:17.555
A tour? Really?

18:17.597 --> 18:19.849
Yeah, he gets to make
money while I slave away

18:19.891 --> 18:22.560
for a year at country
fairs and amusement parks,

18:22.602 --> 18:26.188
on a janky bus that smells like
cheese puffs, weed and funk!

18:27.523 --> 18:29.609
Sorry, um, can he make you
go on a tour

18:29.650 --> 18:30.693
if you don't want to?

18:30.735 --> 18:32.987
Yeah. The only way
out of this mess

18:33.029 --> 18:34.989
is to really blow
it up; go big.

18:35.031 --> 18:36.866
Okay, you're starting
to scare me.

18:36.908 --> 18:38.785
Well, maybe you
should start thinking

18:38.826 --> 18:40.036
along the same lines.

18:40.078 --> 18:42.288
I mean, do you really
want your ex-boyfriend's

18:42.329 --> 18:45.083
boyfriend's sister's
womb carrying your baby?

18:45.124 --> 18:47.835
I mean, I would make
a better surrogate.

18:47.877 --> 18:49.003
I'm kidding.

18:49.045 --> 18:50.755
Though, that would
totally get me out

18:50.797 --> 18:52.256
of my contract
with Dixon.

18:52.298 --> 18:53.758
Hmm.

18:53.800 --> 18:55.426
(sighs)

18:57.720 --> 19:00.014
WOMAN: Well, I'm glad
you finally called.

19:00.056 --> 19:01.891
(laughing)

19:01.933 --> 19:04.685
Okay, okay.

19:04.727 --> 19:07.814
Um, I never... been to Paris.

19:07.855 --> 19:09.732
Whoa! I've been to
Paris a few times.

19:09.774 --> 19:11.109
And I haven't.
Another shot for me.

19:11.150 --> 19:12.860
No, no, no, no, that's not
how you're supposed to play.

19:12.902 --> 19:15.029
I'm the one who's
supposed to take the shot.

19:15.071 --> 19:16.447
(laughs):
Don't be silly.

19:18.699 --> 19:20.952
(both sigh)

19:20.994 --> 19:22.286
Whoo!

19:22.328 --> 19:24.413
That was good.
One more.

19:24.455 --> 19:27.125
So, um, how long have you
been staying in L.A.?

19:27.166 --> 19:28.584
I'm just here for
a job interview.

19:28.626 --> 19:30.377
Oh. So, you're
moving here?

19:30.419 --> 19:33.255
Well, I don't know
if it's gonna pan out.

19:33.297 --> 19:35.174
But at least
I didn't waste a trip.

19:35.215 --> 19:37.426
What do you mean?
I mean, I got to meet you.

19:37.468 --> 19:38.427
Oh.

19:38.469 --> 19:39.887
(laughs)

19:39.929 --> 19:41.347
You are so cute.

19:41.388 --> 19:43.182
Thanks.

19:43.223 --> 19:45.935
Yeah... you're pretty amazing.

19:47.227 --> 19:48.270
My friends, they, uh,

19:48.312 --> 19:49.939
they didn't think
I had a chance.

19:49.981 --> 19:51.816
Really?
Mm-mm.

19:51.858 --> 19:54.527
Oh, well, maybe you shouldn't
hang out with such idiots.

20:08.582 --> 20:10.584
MAX:
So, I thought the old

20:10.626 --> 20:12.837
erupting volcano
would be a good place to start.

20:12.879 --> 20:14.547
That's always reliable.

20:14.588 --> 20:16.256
I like exploding
soda bottles, too.

20:16.298 --> 20:17.550
Kids love explosions.

20:17.591 --> 20:20.386
This is like high school
science lab all over again.

20:20.427 --> 20:23.181
Well, I have a bad reputation
for science phobia.

20:23.222 --> 20:26.059
You refused to
gather dirt samples.

20:26.100 --> 20:28.061
And don't get me
started on your rants

20:28.102 --> 20:29.269
about the periodic table.

20:29.311 --> 20:31.397
I was right about that;
they do need to come up

20:31.438 --> 20:32.648
with better names.

20:32.690 --> 20:34.734
Zirconium is the only
one that you can remember,

20:34.775 --> 20:36.194
and that's because
it's synonymous

20:36.235 --> 20:38.237
with tacky, fake
QVC diamonds.

20:38.278 --> 20:41.782
Imagine if it were
called... Morocco.

20:41.824 --> 20:42.950
Why Morocco?

20:42.992 --> 20:44.451
It's somewhere
fabulous and exotic.

20:44.493 --> 20:47.496
That's an element that I
would want to know more about.

20:47.538 --> 20:48.831
Oh, no, no, no!

20:48.873 --> 20:50.917
Oh, wow.
Okay, okay,
okay, okay!

20:50.958 --> 20:52.126
Okay.

20:52.168 --> 20:53.335
You got it over-excited.

20:53.377 --> 20:54.921
Yeah, this girl can't help it.

20:54.962 --> 20:56.839
(laughs)

20:56.881 --> 20:59.008
Hey. Hey, stop.

20:59.050 --> 21:01.260
(both laugh)

21:01.301 --> 21:03.596
Hi.
Hey.

21:20.571 --> 21:22.448
Good morning. Sleep well?

21:22.489 --> 21:23.490
I'm still asleep.

21:23.532 --> 21:25.952
I didn't sleep at all.

21:27.620 --> 21:29.747
Hi, Ade. Uh...

21:29.789 --> 21:31.916
I'll-I'll see you
later, Naomi.

21:34.001 --> 21:35.502
What is that?

21:35.544 --> 21:36.921
Max spent the night.

21:36.963 --> 21:38.798
And what does that mean?

21:38.839 --> 21:41.259
I think it means we have an
undeniable attraction.

21:41.300 --> 21:43.094
Or it means you're just
horny and vulnerable.

21:43.136 --> 21:45.096
No, it's way
more than that.

21:45.138 --> 21:46.680
What if separating now
is a mistake?

21:46.722 --> 21:48.682
I mean, we're
married, right?

21:48.724 --> 21:50.726
We're not supposed
to just give up.

21:50.768 --> 21:54.897
Clearly, after last night,
it's too soon to call it quits.

21:55.815 --> 21:57.441
ANNOUNCER:
Welcome to

21:57.483 --> 21:59.902
the After-School Achievers
Charity Event,

21:59.944 --> 22:01.946
our special guest,
Terrell Owens!

22:01.988 --> 22:03.322
Hello, everyone!

22:03.363 --> 22:04.573
(cheering)

22:04.615 --> 22:06.117
I'm Terrell Owens. Thank you

22:06.159 --> 22:09.536
for coming to the After-School
Achievers Invitational.

22:09.578 --> 22:11.497
We're here for a great cause:

22:11.538 --> 22:14.541
after-school programs
in sports, science and arts,

22:14.583 --> 22:17.670
and to have a good time,
so everybody bring it!

22:17.711 --> 22:19.964
(cheering)

22:30.016 --> 22:31.684
LIAM:
Hey, T.O.

22:31.725 --> 22:34.436
I'm Liam Court.
I know. Corporate Invaders.

22:34.478 --> 22:36.105
"I'm going
to blow your brains out."

22:36.147 --> 22:37.606
That's some good stuff.

22:37.648 --> 22:39.859
(chuckles)
Thanks, man. Well, um...

22:39.900 --> 22:41.735
I'm quarterbacking
the Hollywood Vines,

22:41.777 --> 22:44.280
but I'm just pumped to be
on the same field as you.

22:44.322 --> 22:47.116
Hey, I love me some me, too.
(chuckles)

22:47.158 --> 22:49.743
Look, I know this is
a scrimmage, but, um...

22:49.785 --> 22:51.578
let's give these people
a real game to watch, huh?

22:51.620 --> 22:53.622
Hey, I'll do whatever
it takes to win.

22:53.664 --> 22:54.790
Just air it out.

22:54.832 --> 22:56.125
Sounds good.

23:00.796 --> 23:02.840
Max. We're up soon.

23:02.882 --> 23:04.717
Yep.

23:04.758 --> 23:08.095
So... about last night...

23:08.137 --> 23:09.638
I know.

23:09.680 --> 23:11.057
Right?

23:11.098 --> 23:13.976
It was a huge mistake.
What?

23:14.018 --> 23:16.520
I... I mean, I-I don't know
how it happened. It just...

23:16.562 --> 23:18.064
Well, I mean, I do.

23:18.105 --> 23:20.024
It's-it's
obvious that...

23:20.066 --> 23:22.860
the attraction is still there,
but it-it was a huge mistake.

23:22.902 --> 23:25.154
Yeah, huge. I mean,
if you're gonna make a mistake,

23:25.196 --> 23:26.446
make a big one, right?

23:27.240 --> 23:29.158
A big, harmless mistake.

23:29.200 --> 23:30.910
No harm, no foul.

23:30.951 --> 23:32.494
I'm into this whole
sports thing.

23:32.536 --> 23:34.914
I need to get ready
for our show, so I am gonna go.

23:34.955 --> 23:35.915
All right?

23:35.956 --> 23:37.375
Okay.

23:41.379 --> 23:43.005
LIAM:
Hey! Ten-hut!

23:43.047 --> 23:45.341
(cheering)

23:47.801 --> 23:49.303
ANNIE:
I hope this

23:49.345 --> 23:50.721
movie thing works out for Liam.

23:50.763 --> 23:53.015
Give him something
to channel his energy into.

23:53.057 --> 23:54.600
Yeah, he keeps
things bottled up.

23:54.641 --> 23:56.643
(sighs)
I know. I mean,

23:56.685 --> 23:59.437
being held hostage,
that was really intense.

23:59.479 --> 24:01.732
Talking about it
would probably help.

24:01.774 --> 24:04.110
He isn't very big
on talking.

24:04.151 --> 24:07.071
Or sharing personal stuff
that's happened.

24:07.113 --> 24:09.489
Maybe he doesn't
want to relive it.

24:09.531 --> 24:11.867
Yeah, I know
how that feels.

24:11.909 --> 24:14.703
But... people need
to be able to talk

24:14.745 --> 24:16.414
about the stuff
they've been through.

24:16.454 --> 24:19.125
The... pathos.

24:19.166 --> 24:20.709
Ade said it best.

24:20.751 --> 24:23.129
I mean, getting it out
feels good.

24:23.170 --> 24:25.047
(sighs)

24:25.089 --> 24:27.925
Like what happened
with Riley?

24:27.967 --> 24:32.179
That. And other things.

24:32.221 --> 24:35.349
I still haven't processed
what happened with Patrick.

24:35.391 --> 24:37.435
Patrick.

24:37.475 --> 24:39.186
That feels like
forever ago.

24:39.228 --> 24:43.983
Yeah, I'm, like, the queen
of delayed reactions.

24:44.024 --> 24:47.485
Now my biggest fear
is Dixon finding out someday.

24:47.527 --> 24:49.405
I mean, he would
freak out.

24:49.447 --> 24:51.198
Well, I mean, you
don't know that.

24:51.240 --> 24:52.450
Give him some credit.

24:52.490 --> 24:56.370
Unlike, say, Teddy, Dixon's
not a judgmental guy.

24:56.412 --> 24:59.457
And, you know, if it's
worrying you so much,

24:59.497 --> 25:02.793
maybe you should just
tell him, get it over with.

25:02.835 --> 25:05.629
(sighs)
Yeah.

25:05.671 --> 25:08.424
Maybe you're right.

25:08.466 --> 25:12.136
Chemistry is really just about
how different elements react

25:12.178 --> 25:13.804
when they're put together.

25:13.846 --> 25:17.599
Dry ice is solid
carbon dioxide,

25:17.641 --> 25:21.561
and when its temperature is
raised by plain old water--

25:21.603 --> 25:23.189
(gasps)
look at that--

25:23.230 --> 25:24.482
creates this fog.

25:24.564 --> 25:26.817
Sometimes the two
elements freeze,

25:26.859 --> 25:28.110
sometimes the
two elements melt,

25:28.152 --> 25:29.362
sometimes the two
elements combust,

25:29.403 --> 25:30.528
and sometimes
the two elements

25:30.570 --> 25:33.324
think they made a huge mistake
and they evaporate.

25:36.743 --> 25:38.120
(kids oohing)

25:38.162 --> 25:40.456
MAX:
Oh, look at that bubble!

25:40.498 --> 25:42.500
How big can it get?
And just like that...

25:42.540 --> 25:43.959
(kids gasp)

25:44.001 --> 25:45.627
...poof, it's gone.
(kids aahing)

25:46.420 --> 25:48.630
Well, Professor Naomi,

25:48.672 --> 25:50.632
not gone. You
see, the matter--

25:50.674 --> 25:53.260
the dry ice-- now,
that ice has gone

25:53.302 --> 25:55.471
from solid
directly to gas,

25:55.513 --> 25:57.681
bypassing the liquid
state entirely.

25:57.723 --> 26:00.767
Yes, but, Professor Max,

26:00.809 --> 26:02.769
where is it?

26:02.811 --> 26:05.189
Can anyone see it?

26:05.231 --> 26:07.066
No.
KIDS:
No.

26:07.107 --> 26:08.401
It's gone.

26:08.442 --> 26:10.819
Dissipated
into nothingness.

26:10.861 --> 26:15.199
Basically, the two elements
had a 100% clean...

26:15.241 --> 26:17.493
break.
(kids gasp)

26:17.535 --> 26:22.873
Well, nothingness, uh,
means anti-matter, and...

26:22.915 --> 26:25.709
that's... a whole
nother matter!

26:25.751 --> 26:26.584
(kids laughing)

26:26.626 --> 26:28.295
And all that really matters

26:28.337 --> 26:30.923
is that the lovely bubble...

26:30.964 --> 26:34.510
...it's as if it never
existed at all.

26:35.635 --> 26:37.555
(quietly):
Are you okay?

26:37.595 --> 26:40.516
(quietly):
Yes, I'm... just...

26:40.558 --> 26:42.142
not okay, no.

26:42.184 --> 26:43.936
Can you please
finish this yourself?

26:47.565 --> 26:52.111
And... that is a good way

26:52.152 --> 26:54.863
to lead into our next
chemical interaction.

26:54.905 --> 26:57.032
She'd be a great look for us.
Definitely.

26:57.074 --> 26:58.325
Hey, Dixon!

26:58.367 --> 26:59.617
Hey.
What's up, buddy?

26:59.659 --> 27:00.827
My partners are here.

27:00.869 --> 27:02.620
We're excited to see
Adrianna's performance.

27:02.662 --> 27:04.290
Ooh, you're gonna
love it. Promise.

27:04.331 --> 27:05.541
Yeah.

27:05.583 --> 27:07.667
Here she is. A-Ade. Ade.

27:07.709 --> 27:09.462
Ade, uh, this is
Rand Gunn.
Oh!

27:09.503 --> 27:12.005
Hey. Sorry, I was
in my zone.

27:12.047 --> 27:13.715
Nice to meet you, Rand.

27:13.757 --> 27:17.136
I sure hope my performance
doesn't disappoint you.

27:17.177 --> 27:18.929
I have something
very special planned.

27:18.971 --> 27:20.764
RAND:
Amazing.

27:20.806 --> 27:23.267
ANNOUNCER: Third and long
for the Hollywood Vines.

27:23.309 --> 27:25.769
With just 13 seconds left
to play, this is it, folks!

27:25.811 --> 27:28.105
All right, they're leaving
a huge hole in the middle.

27:28.147 --> 27:30.357
T.O., you work the sideline,
I'll hit you in the end zone.

27:30.399 --> 27:32.485
All right? On one. Ready?

27:39.533 --> 27:42.077
All right, green 58!

27:42.119 --> 27:43.829
Set! Hut!

27:52.087 --> 27:54.256
(cheering)

27:55.508 --> 27:57.384
ANNOUNCER:
With that amazing pass

27:57.426 --> 28:00.304
and T.O.'s awesome catch, the
Hollywood Vines clinch the win

28:00.346 --> 28:03.681
and $50,000 more
to after-school charities!

28:03.723 --> 28:05.351
Who knew the star
of Corporate Invaders

28:05.392 --> 28:07.102
also had a golden arm?

28:08.437 --> 28:10.481
Yes!

28:19.948 --> 28:22.034
(cameras clicking)

28:29.916 --> 28:32.378
(panting)

28:43.096 --> 28:44.390
(panting)

28:44.431 --> 28:45.683
(sighs)

28:50.646 --> 28:53.232
PIPPA:
You undersold yourself.

28:53.273 --> 28:54.733
Got quite an arm.

28:54.774 --> 28:55.693
You okay?

28:55.734 --> 28:57.152
Yeah, yeah. I'm...

28:57.194 --> 28:58.445
just a little winded.

28:58.487 --> 29:00.072
You're a natural.

29:00.113 --> 29:03.116
Start growing your hair
and sideburns out, Mr. Namath.

29:04.159 --> 29:06.495
Yeah?

29:06.537 --> 29:09.456
All that's left is for you
to meet the execs at the studio

29:09.498 --> 29:10.749
so they can sign off.

29:10.790 --> 29:12.543
And they will. I'll see to it.

29:12.585 --> 29:13.877
Cool.
Get ready

29:13.919 --> 29:15.795
'cause this movie's
gonna change your life.

29:15.837 --> 29:17.590
You thought
you were famous before?

29:17.631 --> 29:20.050
This is gonna send you
into the stratosphere.

29:36.858 --> 29:38.068
Hey.

29:38.110 --> 29:39.486
Look, I'm sorry.
I didn't...

29:39.528 --> 29:41.905
No, you were just
being honest,

29:41.947 --> 29:43.031
which is fine.

29:44.700 --> 29:47.786
I'm just a little surprised...

29:47.827 --> 29:50.247
that you called last night
a huge mistake.

29:50.289 --> 29:52.165
That's not really what I meant.

29:52.207 --> 29:54.918
Means everything between us
was a huge mistake.

29:56.336 --> 29:59.131
That's why you wanted
a clean break, right?

29:59.172 --> 30:01.258
So, poof, it's gone forever

30:01.300 --> 30:03.135
just like that stupid
dry ice bubble.

30:03.176 --> 30:04.344
No.

30:04.386 --> 30:06.263
Look, the only...

30:06.305 --> 30:07.931
I just think that

30:07.973 --> 30:10.684
I need to cut all ties
for a while

30:10.726 --> 30:12.770
because-because
I care about you.

30:12.811 --> 30:15.939
Too much, in fact,
to be just friends right now.

30:15.981 --> 30:17.899
(groans)

30:17.941 --> 30:20.444
When you say it like that,
it sounds all sensible.

30:21.654 --> 30:23.989
I mean, it doesn't feel good.

30:24.030 --> 30:25.907
Yeah, I know.

30:25.949 --> 30:28.744
I mean, I want
to be friends, too.

30:28.786 --> 30:31.747
We do have a very special...

30:31.789 --> 30:33.666
chemistry.

30:33.707 --> 30:36.251
Yeah, the science metaphors
are sort of dork.

30:36.293 --> 30:38.587
The only way that we're both
gonna get some clarity

30:38.629 --> 30:40.464
about what we need
and who we are

30:40.506 --> 30:42.382
is if we spend
a little time apart.

30:42.424 --> 30:44.050
Yeah.

30:44.092 --> 30:47.387
I'm not trying to hurt you
or-or make you crazy...

30:47.429 --> 30:49.389
...er.

30:49.431 --> 30:51.517
(chuckles)

30:52.518 --> 30:54.687
It's just so abrupt,

30:54.728 --> 30:56.480
you know?

30:56.522 --> 30:58.940
I wish we could have...

30:58.982 --> 31:01.401
some sort of-- I don't know--

31:01.443 --> 31:03.612
formal good-bye
or proper send-off.

31:03.654 --> 31:05.739
I just want closure.

31:05.781 --> 31:07.366
I know.

31:07.407 --> 31:08.784
Me, too.

31:09.743 --> 31:11.829
Yeah.

31:19.670 --> 31:21.963
ANNOUNCER:
Coming up on the main stage,

31:22.005 --> 31:26.134
a musical performance
by Adrianna Tate-Duncan.

31:29.555 --> 31:31.390
So...
(clears throat)

31:31.431 --> 31:33.308
you been thinking
about Shane's sister?

31:33.350 --> 31:36.770
Actually, Teddy, I have, uh,
someone I want you to consider.

31:36.812 --> 31:38.980
She's someone
that we both know well.

31:39.022 --> 31:40.733
Adrianna.

31:40.774 --> 31:43.109
(laughs)

31:45.445 --> 31:47.239
You can't be serious.

31:47.280 --> 31:48.532
(sighs)

31:48.574 --> 31:50.534
Silver, I love her to death,
but that is ridiculous.

31:50.576 --> 31:52.327
It's no more ridiculous
than Shane's sister,

31:52.369 --> 31:54.079
whom I've never even met.

31:54.120 --> 31:55.748
At least Ade lives in L.A.

31:55.789 --> 31:59.292
I don't think proximity is
the most important factor here.

31:59.334 --> 32:00.419
Wh-What about stability?

32:00.460 --> 32:02.045
Did you forget Ade
switching out your meds?

32:02.087 --> 32:03.171
She is completely stable.

32:03.213 --> 32:05.131
And she's more than
made that up to me.

32:05.173 --> 32:06.091
I...

32:06.132 --> 32:07.384
Teddy, you're asking me

32:07.426 --> 32:09.636
to consider a total stranger.

32:09.678 --> 32:11.346
(sighs)

32:11.388 --> 32:12.639
Okay.

32:12.681 --> 32:16.059
And did you talk
to Ade about this?

32:16.101 --> 32:17.811
Yeah, we dis...
we discussed it.

32:19.187 --> 32:21.189
We're not just having
a pregnancy, okay?

32:21.231 --> 32:22.566
We're having a child.

32:22.608 --> 32:24.401
We need to be able
to hear each other,

32:24.443 --> 32:25.569
and to compromise.

32:25.611 --> 32:27.404
You gave me someone
to think about,

32:27.446 --> 32:29.573
I'm just doing the same.

32:29.615 --> 32:31.366
ANNOUNCER:
The After-School Achievers

32:31.408 --> 32:34.369
is proud to present
on center stage,

32:34.411 --> 32:36.162
Unfaithful Records
recording artist...

32:36.204 --> 32:37.915
Hey, Dixon. Uh, you
have plans later?

32:37.956 --> 32:39.165
Uh, depends on how this goes.

32:39.207 --> 32:40.250
Okay, well,
there's something

32:40.292 --> 32:41.919
that I want to
talk to you about,

32:41.960 --> 32:43.879
if you have the time.
It's kind of personal...

32:43.921 --> 32:46.381
Uh, hold on, hold on.
Um, she's about to come on.

32:46.423 --> 32:47.466
(sighs)

32:47.507 --> 32:49.008
ANNOUNCER:
Please give her a hand.

32:49.050 --> 32:51.511
(cheering)

32:54.139 --> 32:55.724
Hi, I'm Adrianna.

32:55.766 --> 32:59.770
And I have something very
special planned for you guys.

32:59.812 --> 33:01.229
Dixon,

33:01.271 --> 33:02.940
this is for you.

33:34.179 --> 33:36.264
Maybe she's going
through something.

33:36.306 --> 33:38.892
So, she has to go up there

33:38.934 --> 33:40.936
Well...
She's gonna blow this

33:42.270 --> 33:44.481

No matter what her reasoning is,

34:19.683 --> 34:20.600
Yeah, and?

34:20.641 --> 34:21.685
And?

34:21.726 --> 34:22.811
And he wanted to work with you.

34:22.853 --> 34:23.978
And I was gonna release you,

34:24.021 --> 34:25.522
so you could work
with him without me.

34:25.563 --> 34:27.524
Wait, you were finally
gonna let me go?

34:27.565 --> 34:28.775
If his partners
would've signed off,

34:28.817 --> 34:31.027
he was was gonna take
over your contract, okay?

34:31.069 --> 34:32.320
(sighs)
(chuckles)
He was gonna give me

34:32.362 --> 34:34.155
a few of his other artists
to produce in exchange.

34:34.197 --> 34:35.657
God, why didn't
you tell me?!

34:35.699 --> 34:36.783
Because you
wouldn't listen!

34:36.824 --> 34:38.201
Instead, you were
too busy pretending

34:38.243 --> 34:40.161
that I was the bad
guy in all this.

34:40.203 --> 34:42.496
When, honestly, Ade,
you're the bad guy.

34:42.539 --> 34:44.456
So, I'm done, okay?

34:44.498 --> 34:46.668
You're released.
You happy?

34:46.710 --> 34:49.629
I-I can't even try
to work with you.

34:54.967 --> 34:59.180
Yes, Teddy, Adrianna
was a dumb choice.

34:59.222 --> 35:01.307
Yeah.
I know that.

35:02.434 --> 35:03.727
Well, then why?

35:03.769 --> 35:05.144
'Cause.

35:05.186 --> 35:07.105
Because I want it to be me.

35:08.189 --> 35:09.274
I want to carry my own baby.

35:09.315 --> 35:11.068
I thought we were past that.
I'm not!

35:11.109 --> 35:12.611
Getting diagnosed

35:12.652 --> 35:14.863
with the BRCA gene
was supposed to give me

35:14.905 --> 35:16.239
all these choices, right?

35:16.281 --> 35:18.033
Well, every choice
I've had to make

35:18.075 --> 35:19.785
has been about
giving something up.

35:19.826 --> 35:22.829
My breasts,
my ovaries, my life.

35:22.871 --> 35:24.456
Do I get to have a baby?

35:24.497 --> 35:26.041
Should I wait till I'm married?

35:26.083 --> 35:27.333
Should I just be a single mom?

35:27.375 --> 35:29.544
I don't know, but it's
my choice, it's up to me.

35:29.586 --> 35:30.921
I'm 20 years old.

35:30.963 --> 35:32.839
I'm tired of giving things up.

35:32.881 --> 35:34.841
I know, Silver. I'm sorry.

35:36.927 --> 35:40.346
I can carry our baby.

35:40.388 --> 35:41.807
Even if you hate me.

35:41.848 --> 35:44.267
I don't hate you.

35:44.309 --> 35:45.894
Silver, I was
pissed, okay?

35:45.936 --> 35:47.186
Still am.

35:47.228 --> 35:51.108
And I felt betrayed,
but I-I... I don't hate you.

35:51.149 --> 35:55.070
Then... let me do this.

35:55.112 --> 35:57.447
Just let me do this, please.

35:57.489 --> 35:59.699
I wish I could believe
it was a good idea

35:59.741 --> 36:00.993
for you to carry our baby.

36:01.034 --> 36:02.535
I really do. I just...

36:02.577 --> 36:03.954
(sighs)

36:03.996 --> 36:05.580
...just don't.

36:05.622 --> 36:07.373
I'm sorry for that.

36:07.415 --> 36:09.960
I... I'm not trying
to be a dick.

36:12.545 --> 36:16.008
Maybe not.

36:16.049 --> 36:19.094
But I cannot bring
a new person into this world

36:19.136 --> 36:21.930
coming from a place
of fear and negativity.

36:21.972 --> 36:23.723
That's not what we're doing.

36:23.765 --> 36:25.684
We're just taking care
of ourselves.

36:25.725 --> 36:27.144
Of both of us.

36:29.646 --> 36:31.189
(sniffles)

36:31.230 --> 36:33.191
Okay.

36:34.901 --> 36:36.444
Okay.

36:36.486 --> 36:38.864
If you think
Shane's sister is the...

36:38.905 --> 36:40.615
the perfect person,

36:40.657 --> 36:45.203
then, yeah, I'm open
to meeting her.

36:46.121 --> 36:47.706
I'll let her know.

36:47.747 --> 36:50.834
But if this works out, then...

36:50.876 --> 36:54.713
I get to go to D.C. and visit
her whenever I want, okay?

36:54.754 --> 36:57.841
There might be a little
wrinkle with that.

36:57.883 --> 36:59.676
(scoffs)

36:59.718 --> 37:02.012
She's open to moving to L.A.

37:04.222 --> 37:06.432
Seriously?

37:06.474 --> 37:07.934
Okay.

37:07.976 --> 37:09.144
Silver, no pressure.

37:09.186 --> 37:11.730
If you don't like her,
she's not our surrogate.

37:11.771 --> 37:13.106
I promise you that.

37:18.028 --> 37:19.237
With Armitage Books
behind you,

37:19.278 --> 37:20.864
your blog has
a real shot

37:20.906 --> 37:22.657
at finding the audience
that it deserves.

37:22.699 --> 37:24.617
We have the best publicity
and marketing team

37:24.659 --> 37:25.618
in the business.

37:25.660 --> 37:26.870
Well, that sounds great,
but I'm...

37:26.912 --> 37:28.205
I'm sorry, I just can't.

37:28.246 --> 37:30.123
What?

37:30.165 --> 37:31.708
This is a huge
opportunity.

37:31.750 --> 37:34.252
There are people in my life
that still don't know

37:34.293 --> 37:35.670
about some of the things
I've written.

37:35.712 --> 37:37.756
Are you aware
of what you're giving up here?

37:37.797 --> 37:41.426
Money, fame, exposing
my entire soul to the world--

37:41.467 --> 37:42.969
yeah, I'm aware.

37:43.011 --> 37:45.013
All right, Annie, you can
play coy all you want,

37:45.055 --> 37:46.514
but you showed up
to this meeting

37:46.556 --> 37:49.601
when you could have e-mailed
a simple "No, thank you."

37:49.642 --> 37:51.728
Which leads me to believe
that you have a price.

37:51.770 --> 37:54.231
So, let's just get right
down to it, shall we?

37:54.272 --> 37:57.901
What would it take to get you
to let us publish your work?

37:57.943 --> 38:03.573
Your guarantee that nobody
will ever know I wrote it.

38:03.615 --> 38:06.451
You want to publish anonymously?

38:06.492 --> 38:08.620
You would be a smash
on a book tour.

38:08.661 --> 38:10.538
It's non-negotiable.

38:10.580 --> 38:13.083
Well, if that's the only way.

38:14.918 --> 38:16.920
I'll take a flier
and publish anonymously.

38:16.962 --> 38:19.089
Really?
Yes.

38:19.131 --> 38:21.258
The material will
just have to speak for itself.

38:21.299 --> 38:23.509
Welcome to
Armitage Books,

38:23.551 --> 38:24.803
Author X.

38:24.844 --> 38:26.471
(chuckles)

38:26.512 --> 38:29.099
(knocking)

38:30.308 --> 38:31.643
Hey.
Hi.

38:31.684 --> 38:33.186
Come on in;
she's already here.

38:33.228 --> 38:34.479
Okay.

38:34.520 --> 38:35.647
Hello.

38:35.688 --> 38:36.982
Oh. Hi.

38:37.023 --> 38:38.275
TEDDY:
Silver, this is Michaela.

38:38.316 --> 38:39.484
It's so nice to meet you.

38:39.525 --> 38:41.194
You, too.

38:41.236 --> 38:42.779
Cool.

38:42.821 --> 38:45.198
I'm really nervous.
(laughs)

38:45.240 --> 38:46.365
Me, too.

38:46.407 --> 38:47.993
Good, good. Um...

38:48.034 --> 38:49.035
I'm gonna sit.

38:49.077 --> 38:50.662
(clears throat)

38:50.703 --> 38:52.330
(sighs)

38:52.371 --> 38:55.333
Uh... well...

38:57.169 --> 38:58.128
I don't even know what to ask.

38:58.170 --> 38:59.296
I mean, do you have
any questions?

38:59.337 --> 39:00.588
Look, Teddy told me

39:00.630 --> 39:02.299
all about you and
the whole situation.

39:02.340 --> 39:03.716
Sounds complicated.

39:03.758 --> 39:06.052
Yeah. It is.

39:06.094 --> 39:07.470
But you should know
that I really

39:07.512 --> 39:09.848
admire you for
what you're doing.

39:09.889 --> 39:11.808
I mean, you have to be
so incredibly brave

39:11.850 --> 39:14.393
to trust somebody you just met
to carry your baby.

39:17.730 --> 39:20.817
I'd really like the chance
to be that person.

39:22.986 --> 39:25.488
(knocking)

39:25.530 --> 39:27.740
(chuckles)

39:27.782 --> 39:29.701
(chuckles softly)

39:30.618 --> 39:31.870
Hey.
Hey, man.

39:31.911 --> 39:32.871
Ready to go?

39:32.912 --> 39:34.206
Uh, check-in's not for an hour.

39:34.247 --> 39:36.457
Want to come in and say hi?
Shane's sister is here.

39:36.499 --> 39:38.126
We're talking to her
about being our surrogate.

39:38.168 --> 39:40.170
Hey, Silver.
Hey.

39:40.212 --> 39:41.379
And...

39:46.343 --> 39:47.927
Uh... hi.
Hi.

39:47.969 --> 39:49.304
I'm Navid.

39:49.346 --> 39:51.223
Michaela. Nice to meet you.

39:51.264 --> 39:53.308
Yeah. Likewise.

39:58.646 --> 40:01.440
(sighing)

40:05.570 --> 40:08.198
Knowing that was
the last time made it so...

40:10.158 --> 40:12.577
...epic.

40:14.662 --> 40:17.790
I'm gonna miss you,
Naomi.

40:19.751 --> 40:22.212
A lot.

40:38.311 --> 40:39.729
Did you bag that chick
from the bar?

40:39.771 --> 40:40.980
She looked like
she was actually falling

40:41.022 --> 40:42.523
for whatever line
you gave her.

40:42.565 --> 40:44.525
Ah, nah. Struck out.

40:44.567 --> 40:46.111
Nice, man.
(chuckles)

40:46.152 --> 40:47.570
You just won me 300 bucks.

40:50.323 --> 40:51.866
♪ ♪

40:51.908 --> 40:53.410
Is Liam coming?

41:17.767 --> 41:20.061
Well, look who's here.
(crowd cheering)
