WEBVTT

00:05.798 --> 00:07.567
<i> Previously on</i> Dynasty...
Mia?

00:07.602 --> 00:08.434
You look amazing.

00:08.470 --> 00:09.469
Even better than
you did in college.

00:09.504 --> 00:11.472
I didn't want to ruin
the thing we had going.

00:11.507 --> 00:13.804
Maybe it's best if we keep it
strictly professional.

00:13.839 --> 00:16.147
All of our preliminary building
permits have been denied.

00:16.182 --> 00:17.808
Someone is trying
to keep you from expanding.

00:17.843 --> 00:19.678
The question is, who?

00:19.713 --> 00:21.284
I messed up. Sorry.

00:21.319 --> 00:22.714
You should've called me
before coming here.

00:22.749 --> 00:25.420
Without me, your plan to steal
the manor back won't work.

00:25.455 --> 00:26.784
Extortion?

00:26.819 --> 00:28.159
Spoken like
a true Carrington.

00:28.194 --> 00:29.391
And a true Deveraux.

00:32.297 --> 00:35.397
Oh, I love
the smell of strategy--

00:35.432 --> 00:37.267
and whiskey-- in the morning.

00:37.302 --> 00:38.763
What's the latest in the U.K.?

00:38.798 --> 00:40.303
Nothing good.

00:40.338 --> 00:41.766
Our land buy is final,
but the appeal

00:41.801 --> 00:45.341
to have our original permits
reinstated has been denied.

00:45.376 --> 00:47.673
So we're the proud owners
of incredibly expensive,

00:47.708 --> 00:50.577
totally unusable
Scottish countryside.

00:50.612 --> 00:51.710
And it was by design.

00:51.745 --> 00:54.317
The Scotland Heritage Foundation

00:54.352 --> 00:56.715
filed their claim
as soon as our sale closed,

00:56.750 --> 00:58.585
claiming that some
pile of rocks on site

00:58.620 --> 01:00.389
was evidence of an old castle.

01:00.424 --> 01:02.787
Well, that's unacceptable.
I've invested too much

01:02.822 --> 01:05.856
to get rock-blocked
by some old dudes waring plaid.

01:05.891 --> 01:07.231
Going to court
could cost us millions.

01:07.266 --> 01:08.529
I would suggest selling,

01:08.564 --> 01:09.860
but, you know, no one's
gonna buy locked-up land.

01:09.895 --> 01:11.499
Wait, wait, wait, wait, hold on.

01:11.534 --> 01:13.534
It says here that
Colin McNaughton

01:13.569 --> 01:15.338
is one of the
claim's cosponsors.

01:15.373 --> 01:16.702
We went to Wharton together.

01:16.737 --> 01:17.868
Well, perfect.
Is there any chance

01:17.903 --> 01:19.210
you can call up your old pal

01:19.245 --> 01:21.113
and get him
to drop the suit?
Well...

01:21.148 --> 01:23.313
he lives stateside now,
but "old pal"

01:23.348 --> 01:25.216
is a bit of a stretch.

01:25.251 --> 01:27.086
Although we were in
the Wharton Wharblers together.

01:28.617 --> 01:32.487
Our a cappella group that
performed at the White House?

01:32.522 --> 01:35.226
Remind me to take back
your number one dad decanter.

01:35.261 --> 01:38.757
The point is, I will appeal
to our shared love of music--

01:38.792 --> 01:41.232
or technically, lack of music--

01:41.267 --> 01:43.663
and get him to see
that this whole castle claim

01:43.698 --> 01:46.435
is a giant misunderstanding.

01:46.470 --> 01:49.372
Sorry again about Ryan.
Between work and school,

01:49.407 --> 01:51.143
he doesn't have a lot
of time for brunch,

01:51.178 --> 01:54.773
but he's only been here for a
few weeks, so it's totally fine.

01:54.808 --> 01:58.381
When you put "totally" in front
of it, I totally believe you.

01:58.416 --> 01:59.811
Look, all relationships
experience growing pains.

01:59.846 --> 02:01.318
Even Adam and I.

02:01.353 --> 02:03.584
Ew. Please don't
compare our relationships.

02:03.619 --> 02:05.454
Anyway,
the one benefit

02:05.489 --> 02:07.753
of Ryan being busy
is more time for La Mirage

02:07.788 --> 02:10.162
and the new Infinity Team
project.

02:10.197 --> 02:12.659
Perfect. Focus on business.
Exactly.

02:12.694 --> 02:14.331
No more relationship drama.

02:14.366 --> 02:15.926
It's time to turn
my love-life lemons

02:15.961 --> 02:17.532
into work-life limoncello.

02:17.567 --> 02:19.270
If we can make
this deal to partner

02:19.305 --> 02:21.734
on the hotel expansion
and share their nightlife brand,

02:21.769 --> 02:23.373
La Mirage
could go to the next level.

02:23.408 --> 02:25.507
Ooh. Looks like your
new partners are here,

02:25.542 --> 02:27.674
and they have nightlife
written all over them.

02:27.709 --> 02:28.807
Blaine?

02:28.842 --> 02:30.248
Sam Jones.
Sam.

02:30.283 --> 02:31.876
What a thrill to put a face--

02:31.911 --> 02:33.515
and a space-- to the name.

02:33.550 --> 02:34.747
Amen to that.

02:34.782 --> 02:37.552
This is my event
coordinator Kirby Anders.

02:37.587 --> 02:39.917
And, uh, this
must be your crew?

02:39.952 --> 02:44.361
Marcus is our lead producer,
Amber handles design,

02:44.396 --> 02:46.825
Gavin's our money man
and back there

02:46.860 --> 02:49.531
is our new PR guru Fletcher.

02:50.567 --> 02:51.665
Fletcher?

02:51.700 --> 02:53.337
Hi, Sam.

02:54.406 --> 02:56.340
It's good to see you again.

02:57.673 --> 03:00.839
So, um, who's ready to
see the event space?

03:00.874 --> 03:01.972
Yeah.

03:02.007 --> 03:03.677
This way.

03:10.488 --> 03:11.586
Are you okay?

03:11.621 --> 03:13.852
Yeah. We're just
two professionals

03:13.887 --> 03:15.557
who had a torrid love affair
that ended

03:15.592 --> 03:17.823
when he didn't leave
his husband, but, uh,

03:17.858 --> 03:19.495
it's totally fine.

03:19.530 --> 03:20.892
Limoncello, remember?

03:21.895 --> 03:23.268
Well, how was
your retreat?

03:23.303 --> 03:24.863
Ugh, it was incredible.

03:24.898 --> 03:27.734
It's amazing what just a few
weeks of rest can do.

03:27.769 --> 03:29.373
Ah, I can see that now.

03:29.408 --> 03:31.243
At first, I thought
it was just that outfit.

03:31.278 --> 03:32.508
I mean, mwah.

03:32.543 --> 03:35.247
I lost my stress triggers,
not my style, okay?

03:35.282 --> 03:36.875
Ah.
Thanks.

03:36.910 --> 03:38.745
I could do with less stress.

03:38.780 --> 03:40.516
Is that why you wanted
to get in a round today?

03:40.551 --> 03:42.980
Well, that, and I have
a charity golf tournament

03:43.015 --> 03:45.389
coming up and I don't want
to embarrass myself.

03:45.424 --> 03:46.753
Hmm.
And I was hoping

03:46.788 --> 03:48.326
to work things out
with a woman I met

03:48.361 --> 03:49.657
while you were away.

03:49.692 --> 03:51.461
Well, tending to the people
in your life

03:51.496 --> 03:53.496
is the best way
to tend to yourself.

03:53.531 --> 03:54.629
Okay,

03:54.664 --> 03:55.894
my retreat leader's words,
but...

03:55.929 --> 03:57.500
I buy what
he's selling.

03:57.535 --> 04:00.635
So if that's what you want,
then go for it.

04:00.670 --> 04:02.769
You're right.

04:02.804 --> 04:03.869
Thanks.

04:03.904 --> 04:05.310
The truth is,

04:05.345 --> 04:06.905
I'm on a similar mission.

04:06.940 --> 04:10.381
I am done neglecting
important relationships...

04:10.416 --> 04:12.581
and my golf game.

04:18.688 --> 04:20.292
Sorry I'm late.

04:20.327 --> 04:21.920
Fallon's latest play

04:21.955 --> 04:23.889
for global domination's
hit a bit of a snag.

04:23.924 --> 04:25.825
Is that my, uh...

04:25.860 --> 04:27.398
our father?

04:27.433 --> 04:29.730
Yes. I found it in
my mother's house

04:29.765 --> 04:31.732
when I was cleaning
out her stuff.

04:31.767 --> 04:33.701
But I don't remember
him like this.

04:33.736 --> 04:36.374
Well, if it makes you feel
any better, neither do I.

04:36.409 --> 04:37.507
Is that what's
bothering you?

04:37.542 --> 04:39.003
I was so caught up
in tricking Alexis,

04:39.038 --> 04:41.940
I had forgotten the only thing
he left me was a pile of dirt.

04:41.975 --> 04:44.481
Another slap in the face.

04:44.516 --> 04:46.747
Well, I'm not gonna argue
that you didn't deserve better,

04:46.782 --> 04:48.419
but that's what
we're doing here, right?

04:48.454 --> 04:50.047
We're getting you
what you're owed.

04:50.082 --> 04:51.983
Once we steal the manor
back from Alexis,

04:52.018 --> 04:53.787
you can officially plant a flag

04:53.822 --> 04:55.954
in the home
that our father denied you.

04:57.023 --> 04:58.957
You're right. Let's do it.

04:58.992 --> 05:01.663
Now that Alexis is sure that the
mine is filled with diamonds,

05:01.698 --> 05:03.830
she'll do whatever it takes
to keep it.

05:03.865 --> 05:06.063
So we keep draining her of cash
until she can't afford

05:06.098 --> 05:08.703
to keep the diamond operation
running.

05:08.738 --> 05:10.837
And that's when I show up
with an offer she can't refuse.

05:14.546 --> 05:15.776
I think it's time

05:15.811 --> 05:17.943
we amp up the pressure

05:17.978 --> 05:19.483
a little bit
before then.

05:20.486 --> 05:21.617
Call your lawyer.

05:49.174 --> 05:51.042
<i> Gracias a Dios.</i>

05:54.619 --> 05:56.454
Fallon friggin' Carrington.

05:56.489 --> 05:57.917
Oh...

05:57.952 --> 06:01.151
Not technically my middle name,
but yes, it's me.

06:01.186 --> 06:03.956
How is my favorite
baritone doing?

06:03.991 --> 06:06.398
It has certainly been a while.

06:06.433 --> 06:07.399
I know it has.
Although, you know,

06:07.434 --> 06:09.731
it feels like just yesterday
we were harmonizing

06:09.766 --> 06:11.931
through the Nationals
with the Wharblers.

06:11.966 --> 06:14.538
Doesn't it?
So, what brings you by?

06:14.573 --> 06:17.805
It's a funny thing, my company
is actually the defendant

06:17.840 --> 06:20.709
in a lawsuit
you're cosponsoring.

06:20.744 --> 06:22.546
Fallon Unlimited, right.

06:22.581 --> 06:24.174
Guess I hadn't put
those pieces together.

06:24.209 --> 06:27.518
Yeah. Well, as a friend,
I just wanted to warn you,

06:27.553 --> 06:30.686
I think the Heritage Foundation
is making huge a mistake.

06:30.721 --> 06:32.820
I mean, do you really care
about an old pile of rocks

06:32.855 --> 06:34.459
that may or may not be a castle?

06:34.494 --> 06:36.956
I couldn't
care less about the castle.

06:36.991 --> 06:38.727
Perfect. So you'll convince
the Foundation

06:38.762 --> 06:40.058
to drop this whole thing?

06:40.093 --> 06:42.093
Not so much.
Hmm?

06:42.128 --> 06:44.128
While I don't care
about some castle,

06:44.163 --> 06:45.800
I do care about stopping you

06:45.835 --> 06:47.967
and getting that land
for myself.

06:48.002 --> 06:50.838
It's what the French
call<i> le vengeance.</i>

06:50.873 --> 06:53.445
I see you're still holding
onto that whole

06:53.480 --> 06:55.546
"Wharton cheating scandal"
thing.

06:55.581 --> 06:56.943
If you're referring to the time
you got me expelled

06:56.978 --> 07:00.485
so you could finish first
in the class, then, yes.

07:00.520 --> 07:01.750
I didn't force you to cheat.

07:01.785 --> 07:04.522
Please tell me you haven't
been waiting a decade

07:04.557 --> 07:07.184
to use some Scottish land deal
to get revenge on me.

07:07.219 --> 07:09.087
I haven't thought
about you in years.

07:09.122 --> 07:10.528
Huh.
But then,

07:10.563 --> 07:11.793
you stole the land
I'd been eyeing.

07:11.828 --> 07:15.225
Stole? No, I won that bid
fair and square.

07:15.260 --> 07:16.798
Nothing you ever do is fair.

07:16.833 --> 07:18.470
Look,

07:18.505 --> 07:19.834
you have two options:

07:19.869 --> 07:21.000
spend loads of money and time

07:21.035 --> 07:22.672
fighting the lawsuit,

07:22.707 --> 07:24.674
or sell the land to me
at 50% of the purchase price.

07:24.709 --> 07:26.577
Okay.

07:26.612 --> 07:29.811
Since I don't really respond
well to bullies or threats,

07:29.846 --> 07:31.978
I think I'm gonna go
with option three,

07:32.013 --> 07:33.716
which is currently classified,

07:33.751 --> 07:36.048
but definitely
involves you losing.

07:36.083 --> 07:39.524
Oh, and by the way,
for the record,

07:39.559 --> 07:42.186
you were never
my favorite baritone,

07:42.221 --> 07:46.894
because just like your cheating
schemes, you always fall flat.

07:46.929 --> 07:49.193
♪ ♪

08:11.085 --> 08:13.085
Hello? Where the hell
is everybody?

08:13.120 --> 08:15.252
They're on their lunch break.

08:15.287 --> 08:18.288
But we have bigger issues
to discuss.

08:18.323 --> 08:21.159
You need to stop waving
that piece of paper at me first.

08:21.194 --> 08:25.130
This piece of paper is a lawsuit
filed by Blake demanding

08:25.165 --> 08:26.901
half of the mineral rights.

08:26.936 --> 08:29.640
Thomas willed you
the mineral rights, not Blake.

08:29.675 --> 08:31.741
He's just being his petty self.

08:31.776 --> 08:34.777
His lawyers are arguing
that Thomas's original will

08:34.812 --> 08:37.076
specifies that Blake's owed half

08:37.111 --> 08:38.979
of all assets,
which means

08:39.014 --> 08:40.981
mineral rights and diamonds.

08:41.016 --> 08:42.180
A Blake win

08:42.215 --> 08:44.589
cuts our profits in half.

08:44.624 --> 08:46.591
Ugh. I can't believe him.

08:46.626 --> 08:48.692
Really? And what did you
expect to happen

08:48.727 --> 08:51.794
when you stole his home and left
him to walk away empty-handed?

08:51.829 --> 08:54.929
I didn't think about it because
I was too busy enjoying myself.

08:54.964 --> 08:57.701
Okay, if you handle
your hysteria,

08:57.736 --> 09:00.737
I will handle this.
Give me that.

09:00.772 --> 09:02.673
<i> So I found out the lawsuit</i>

09:02.708 --> 09:04.301
was filed incredibly fast,
which means someone

09:04.336 --> 09:06.039
had to help Colin
push it through.

09:06.074 --> 09:07.777
Well, that tracks.
He thinks the rules

09:07.812 --> 09:09.680
don't apply to his cheating ass.

09:09.715 --> 09:11.077
Yeah, clearly. I looked into
the Wharton thing, too.

09:11.112 --> 09:12.617
I mean, I'll keep digging,
but if we can find out

09:12.652 --> 09:14.179
who helped Colin do this,

09:14.214 --> 09:15.950
I mean, we could threaten
exposure and shut it down.

09:15.985 --> 09:19.591
As much as I'm loving your whole
Ronan Farrow energy, we don't

09:19.626 --> 09:20.691
have months to
investigate.

09:20.726 --> 09:22.253
This project is
hemorrhaging money.

09:22.288 --> 09:24.057
And if it continues,
I might have to walk away

09:24.092 --> 09:25.289
with a huge loss.

09:25.324 --> 09:26.895
And you don't walk away.

09:26.930 --> 09:30.261
That's right.
It's time to give Colin a taste

09:30.296 --> 09:33.132
of his own permit medicine.

09:35.268 --> 09:39.644
Walt! How's my favorite
city inspector?

09:41.208 --> 09:43.076
It's nice to hear a guy
admit he acted

09:43.111 --> 09:45.815
like a real idiot for once.

09:45.850 --> 09:48.620
It's the apology
you deserved a long time ago.

09:48.655 --> 09:50.952
I'm just relieved I could
deliver it in person.

09:50.987 --> 09:54.153
Well, it was hard to say no
after your 15th text,

09:54.188 --> 09:56.155
but it's still a lot to process.

09:56.190 --> 09:58.157
You didn't tell me
you were married,

09:58.192 --> 09:59.829
then you admitted
you were married and said

09:59.864 --> 10:01.831
it didn't mean anything,
then we hooked up,

10:01.866 --> 10:03.998
but you stayed married
and you ghosted me.

10:04.033 --> 10:06.935
That's why I'm apologizing.

10:06.970 --> 10:09.399
I was really
hurting back then.

10:09.434 --> 10:11.104
But I'm putting in the work
to do better.

10:11.139 --> 10:13.139
And I hope I can get a second...

10:15.407 --> 10:16.846
...third chance?

10:18.916 --> 10:21.411
Delivery for...

10:21.446 --> 10:22.654
Jeff?

10:22.689 --> 10:24.117
Culhane?

10:24.152 --> 10:25.283
You two know each other?

10:25.318 --> 10:26.889
Yeah.
We do.

10:26.924 --> 10:28.957
But I don't think
that gift's for me.

10:30.323 --> 10:32.422
Actually,
it's time for me to work

10:32.457 --> 10:34.765
and Jeff to go.

10:34.800 --> 10:36.096
Talk later?

10:36.131 --> 10:38.637
Yeah. Sure thing.

10:44.271 --> 10:46.106
And why
are you here?

10:46.141 --> 10:49.109
You don't have to be a pretend
volunteer anymore, remember?

10:49.144 --> 10:50.781
Doesn't mean I can't
still help you out, right?

10:52.147 --> 10:53.443
If you really mean that,

10:53.478 --> 10:55.687
follow me.

10:55.722 --> 10:57.249
And you can leave that here.

10:58.857 --> 11:00.824
This sounds great.
We'll keep moving forward.

11:00.859 --> 11:03.761
I'll see you soon. Thank you.
Thank you.

11:03.796 --> 11:05.455
Thank you, guys.

11:05.490 --> 11:07.028
Fletcher, wait.

11:07.063 --> 11:10.900
Uh, I don't have any decks
ready yet, but, uh,

11:10.935 --> 11:12.165
now that I know what
you guys are thinking...

11:12.200 --> 11:14.332
Can you please tell
work Fletcher to go away

11:14.367 --> 11:16.906
so we can address
the elephant in the hotel?

11:16.941 --> 11:19.205
Which sounds like a kid's book,
but it's actually about us.

11:19.240 --> 11:22.780
Okay, yeah, um...

11:22.815 --> 11:24.342
I'm sorry we didn't
talk earlier.

11:24.377 --> 11:27.345
I was, uh, just trying
to keep it professional.

11:27.380 --> 11:31.789
Look, uh, this opportunity
is incredibly important for me,

11:31.824 --> 11:36.090
and I just want to be
very clear: everything's fine.

11:36.125 --> 11:38.488
Okay? You, um,
chose your husband,

11:38.523 --> 11:41.458
I got over it
and I'm doing great.

11:41.493 --> 11:43.097
So glad you're-you're good.

11:43.132 --> 11:44.362
"Great."

11:44.397 --> 11:46.265
Great.

11:46.300 --> 11:49.037
But I-I need to be clear, too.

11:50.403 --> 11:53.503
My husband and I just
finalized our divorce.

11:53.538 --> 11:55.879
Divorce?

11:55.914 --> 11:59.476
Uh, well, congrats.

11:59.511 --> 12:02.182
Or sorry? Uh...

12:02.217 --> 12:03.788
I don't know
which way to go here.

12:03.823 --> 12:06.923
Okay, Sam,
I took this job on purpose

12:06.958 --> 12:08.826
so I could
see you again.

12:08.861 --> 12:11.323
What we had was a,
was a once-in-a-lifetime

12:11.358 --> 12:13.391
and, uh...

12:13.426 --> 12:15.932
I want you back.

12:22.171 --> 12:23.500
Look who's here.

12:23.535 --> 12:26.107
I would ask if the bank
also foreclosed on your soul,

12:26.142 --> 12:28.109
but I don't think
you've ever had one.

12:28.144 --> 12:30.111
Well, at least you're not
being melodramatic.

12:30.146 --> 12:32.377
You're suing your own sister?

12:32.412 --> 12:34.379
If you expect me to believe
you're here out of some concern

12:34.414 --> 12:36.513
for Dominique,
you should try another tack.

12:36.548 --> 12:38.317
Or allow us to finish
our game in peace.

12:39.485 --> 12:41.386
There.

12:41.421 --> 12:43.454
The game is now in pieces.

12:43.489 --> 12:45.225
I don't care about Dominique,

12:45.260 --> 12:46.159
and neither do you.

12:46.195 --> 12:48.228
You only care about
the life that you lost.

12:48.263 --> 12:51.462
You're like a crying child
missing his silver spoon.

12:51.497 --> 12:54.201
I'm on the edge of my seat
waiting for some coherent point.

12:54.236 --> 12:55.807
I have a proposition.

12:55.842 --> 12:57.138
Oh, been there, done that.

12:59.879 --> 13:03.947
This insanely generous
amount of money is yours...

13:03.982 --> 13:07.885
if you walk away from
the mineral rights forever.

13:07.920 --> 13:10.217
This needless fighting
is depleting us all,

13:10.252 --> 13:11.889
and I'm losing
my sunny disposition.

13:15.994 --> 13:17.422
Well?

13:25.333 --> 13:27.938
This isn't about money.
This is about my legacy,

13:27.973 --> 13:30.501
which you stole
along with the manor.

13:30.536 --> 13:32.437
Neither you nor my sister

13:32.472 --> 13:34.340
are gonna keep me
from getting what's mine.

13:34.375 --> 13:36.815
I guess we'll find out.

13:42.119 --> 13:45.186
Why didn't you take the money?

13:45.221 --> 13:47.287
I thought our current mission
was to drain her

13:47.322 --> 13:49.322
of her cash.
Yeah, that's one step.
But I still need

13:49.357 --> 13:51.291
to keep the mineral rights
dispute alive.

13:51.326 --> 13:53.260
That way,
you retain your leverage.

13:53.295 --> 13:55.559
And if she thinks
you're not gonna give in,

13:55.594 --> 13:58.331
she'll hold on tighter.
Exactly.
Now that she's on the hook,

13:58.366 --> 13:59.904
I'll just keep tugging
on the line

13:59.939 --> 14:02.071
so Dominique
can dig her teeth deeper

14:02.106 --> 14:04.106
into Alexis's bank account.

14:05.505 --> 14:07.439
Home repairs
ain't cheap these days.

14:10.642 --> 14:12.477
All alone?

14:12.512 --> 14:14.083
Ah.

14:14.118 --> 14:15.348
Your staff jumped ship
when they heard

14:15.383 --> 14:16.987
you completely bungled
the U.K. project?

14:17.022 --> 14:18.384
No, Colin.

14:18.419 --> 14:20.584
It's 8:00 p.m. They went home.

14:20.619 --> 14:22.960
Which makes me wonder
why you're here.

14:22.995 --> 14:25.127
My tennis lesson with my wife
was just interrupted

14:25.162 --> 14:27.360
by my contractor informing me
the construction

14:27.395 --> 14:29.362
on my marketing suites
was halted

14:29.397 --> 14:31.133
due to code violations.

14:31.168 --> 14:32.497
Well, that explains

14:32.532 --> 14:33.531
those crispy boys.

14:33.566 --> 14:34.972
If you must know,

14:35.007 --> 14:36.941
these were gifted to me
by Andy Murray.

14:36.976 --> 14:39.108
Look, we both know
you're behind this.

14:39.143 --> 14:40.340
It's not exactly subtle.

14:40.375 --> 14:42.507
But it's nice to see
your MO hasn't changed:

14:42.542 --> 14:45.213
taking people out
to get what you want.

14:45.248 --> 14:49.250
You started this war
off some sick and sad vendetta.

14:49.285 --> 14:51.384
But you can also end it.

14:51.419 --> 14:55.256
Drop the claim so we can both
get back to building.

14:55.291 --> 14:56.928
If you think my company's
financial health

14:56.963 --> 14:58.930
hinges on one office building,

14:58.965 --> 15:01.526
then I fear you're more naive
now than you were at Wharton.

15:01.561 --> 15:04.001
I didn't come here
to drop the claim.

15:04.036 --> 15:08.104
But I am dropping the offer
on the land from 50% to 30%.

15:08.139 --> 15:09.567
How generous.
Oh,

15:09.602 --> 15:11.470
and some more good news:
my request

15:11.505 --> 15:13.670
to push the suit hearing
back a month was approved,

15:13.705 --> 15:15.947
so now you have ample
time to prepare.

15:15.982 --> 15:18.983
Wait. I just realized,
if this drags on,

15:19.018 --> 15:21.579
you won't be able to do business
with anyone soon.

15:21.614 --> 15:23.581
I know you're bleeding out fast.

15:23.616 --> 15:26.023
Oh! Is that a dumpling?

15:26.058 --> 15:27.684
No. Uh...
Look,

15:27.719 --> 15:29.158
you did your best, sweetheart,

15:29.193 --> 15:30.555
but your best isn't
good enough anymore.

15:30.590 --> 15:31.721
You know what?

15:31.756 --> 15:33.492
Let's make it 20%.

15:33.527 --> 15:34.966
My offer is sinking,

15:35.001 --> 15:38.200
just like you.

15:38.235 --> 15:40.598
I hope you're allergic
to gluten.

15:49.081 --> 15:50.707
Silver lining,
I've lost my appetite

15:50.742 --> 15:53.017
in this Bermuda love triangle.

15:53.052 --> 15:54.579
Fletcher's screwing
with my metabolism.

15:54.614 --> 15:57.087
What did Fletcher say, exactly?

15:57.122 --> 15:58.385
He divorced his husband,

15:58.420 --> 16:00.519
he took the job with Infinity
to see me,

16:00.554 --> 16:03.291
and he wants me back.
That's it?

16:03.326 --> 16:06.294
That's it? I experienced
at least an entire plot

16:06.329 --> 16:08.131
from<i> Love Actually</i>
in 60 seconds.

16:08.166 --> 16:11.695
Well, I'm sure
you handled it calmly.
Well,

16:11.730 --> 16:13.268
I told him I had moved on

16:13.303 --> 16:15.105
and, um,
that I have a boyfriend,

16:15.140 --> 16:17.173
and then I pretended
there was a hotel emergency.

16:17.208 --> 16:21.012
I thought you weren't hungry.
Ew, I'm unconsciously
guilt-grazing carbs.

16:21.047 --> 16:22.409
How am I supposed to work
with him?

16:22.444 --> 16:23.641
Do you want Fletcher back?

16:23.676 --> 16:25.082
No.

16:25.117 --> 16:27.546
But you feel guilty?
Yes.

16:27.581 --> 16:29.416
I mean, Ryan doesn't know

16:29.451 --> 16:30.780
my past boyfriend
is my new coworker.

16:30.815 --> 16:33.486
So tell him.
Maybe he won't care.

16:33.521 --> 16:34.751
What if he doesn't believe me
when I tell him

16:34.786 --> 16:36.126
there's nothing to worry about?

16:36.161 --> 16:38.293
I mean, my priority is Ryan.

16:38.328 --> 16:39.558
But?

16:39.593 --> 16:41.395
But I don't seem to be Ryan's.

16:41.430 --> 16:43.562
He left me on read for 14 hours.

16:43.597 --> 16:45.300
Before I can talk to him,

16:45.335 --> 16:47.335
I need to find him.

16:49.405 --> 16:51.042
What?

16:51.077 --> 16:53.440
I guess your charm offensive
didn't work.

16:53.475 --> 16:57.048
Your music buddy's not singing
the same song as you?
Very clever.

16:57.083 --> 16:58.313
No, he's in this for revenge.

16:58.348 --> 17:01.151
Not even my immeasurable charm
could fix that.

17:01.186 --> 17:04.055
So, you're building a castle
on your desk to get back at him?

17:04.090 --> 17:06.288
Isn't that
what you were wearing yesterday?
I am

17:06.323 --> 17:07.751
a little weirded out
that my father

17:07.786 --> 17:10.754
is tracking my wardrobe,
but I am far too tired

17:10.789 --> 17:13.493
after my all-night study session
to get into it.

17:14.496 --> 17:17.761
I now know more
about Scottish zoning laws

17:17.796 --> 17:20.170
and battlefield authentication

17:20.205 --> 17:22.601
than the Heritage Foundation
and courts combined.

17:22.636 --> 17:24.735
I don't doubt it.

17:24.770 --> 17:26.506
But we agreed, we can't afford
to fight the case.

17:26.541 --> 17:29.773
Which leads me
to countermove number two.

17:29.808 --> 17:31.280
McNaughton Global Media's
headquarters

17:31.315 --> 17:33.546
sits on the edge
of a historic battlefield.

17:33.581 --> 17:36.087
According
to Preservation Code 893,

17:36.122 --> 17:38.089
they are required to fund upkeep

17:38.124 --> 17:40.091
for all historical assets
in the vicinity.

17:40.126 --> 17:43.358
So if we can conjure some
old-timey muskets and swords,

17:43.393 --> 17:45.096
then I could threaten Colin.
Hold on.

17:45.131 --> 17:46.361
None of this matters.

17:46.396 --> 17:48.693
You neglected to tell
me that Colin was heir

17:48.728 --> 17:50.398
to the McNaughton
Media empire.

17:50.433 --> 17:52.103
If he's anything
like his father,

17:52.138 --> 17:53.764
some fake artifacts

17:53.799 --> 17:56.503
are not gonna stop him.
So, what, we just give up?

17:56.538 --> 17:59.308
If you're still planning to take
the company public next year,

17:59.343 --> 18:01.376
you can't afford a personal feud
dragging you down.

18:01.411 --> 18:03.609
Colin is the one
that made this personal, not me.

18:03.644 --> 18:05.248
Well, unfortunately,
that's irrelevant.

18:05.283 --> 18:07.184
Before Colin lowers
his price any further,

18:07.219 --> 18:08.647
I would suggest selling.
Oh, come on.

18:08.682 --> 18:10.649
If this was your company,
you would never give in.

18:10.684 --> 18:12.585
It's not giving in.

18:12.620 --> 18:14.389
It's cutting your losses

18:14.424 --> 18:16.886
to avoid a war
with a historically vindictive

18:16.921 --> 18:18.822
and very powerful family.

18:21.431 --> 18:22.661
The chief of staff position

18:22.696 --> 18:24.399
is finally within
arm's reach.

18:24.434 --> 18:27.171
My future is finally
coming into focus,

18:27.206 --> 18:28.733
and I want that future

18:28.768 --> 18:31.571
to involve Kirby.
What does that mean,
exactly?

18:31.606 --> 18:33.540
I'm thinking of
proposing to her.

18:33.575 --> 18:35.674
N-Not today, but
at some point.

18:35.709 --> 18:38.149
Oh, don't get ahead
of yourself, dear.

18:38.184 --> 18:41.746
You don't have that job yet,
and Kirby is still Kirby.

18:41.781 --> 18:43.253
You never know
what could happen.

18:43.288 --> 18:45.321
Mother, I'm not asking you
for her hand.

18:45.356 --> 18:47.389
I'm asking you for a diamond
for the engagement ring.

18:47.424 --> 18:50.392
Despite that very
embarrassing sushi stunt

18:50.427 --> 18:52.922
you pulled on my birthday,
I still want to include you,

18:52.957 --> 18:54.759
and I thought
this would be a nice way.

18:54.794 --> 18:56.299
Mine are serious diamonds.

18:56.334 --> 18:58.169
Have you considered
the Lenox mall?

18:59.304 --> 19:02.305
What the hell?

19:02.340 --> 19:03.867
I hate to admit it,

19:03.902 --> 19:06.309
but this house is falling apart
without Anders.

19:06.344 --> 19:08.212
Is that why all of the paintings
are crooked?

19:10.216 --> 19:12.843
I don't have time for this.

19:14.880 --> 19:16.319
Could you help?
Oh, yeah.

19:20.358 --> 19:22.325
Wow.

19:22.360 --> 19:25.592
I was definitely surprised.

19:25.627 --> 19:27.759
Not as surprised as I was
to see you skipping up

19:27.794 --> 19:29.464
in there.
I was not skipping.

19:29.499 --> 19:31.433
But, hey,

19:31.468 --> 19:33.732
now that I know
you two have a past, I...

19:33.767 --> 19:35.338
I'm sorry for the mix-up, man.

19:35.373 --> 19:36.570
You didn't do anything wrong.

19:36.605 --> 19:37.901
We both just
have good taste

19:37.936 --> 19:40.607
if not the best
communication skills.

19:40.642 --> 19:43.346
Well, I'm glad
we got it all straightened out.

19:43.381 --> 19:46.316
Look, I'd never let a lady
come between our friendship,

19:46.351 --> 19:48.516
but Mia...

19:48.551 --> 19:51.651
Well,
she's something special to me.

19:51.686 --> 19:52.916
No, I totally get it, man.

19:52.951 --> 19:55.721
And I promise I will step aside.

19:55.756 --> 19:58.328
Not that I'm even on her radar.

19:58.363 --> 20:00.363
Thank you.

20:00.398 --> 20:02.365
I don't know
if I can make it right with her,

20:02.400 --> 20:05.203
but I'm finally
in a place to try.

20:11.871 --> 20:14.641
Is your wife
as intimidating as she looks?

20:14.676 --> 20:15.775
Don't worry about my wife.

20:15.811 --> 20:18.579
So, I assume you're here
to announce your next move.

20:18.614 --> 20:21.714
Let me guess, you canceled
my Hulu subscription?

20:22.750 --> 20:25.850
I am done engaging
in this fight.

20:25.885 --> 20:27.819
I have decided
to sell you the land

20:27.854 --> 20:30.525
for the original offer
of 50% percent.

20:30.560 --> 20:33.825
I'll even throw in Hulu ad-free
if you want.

20:33.860 --> 20:36.795
I don't normally negotiate,
but even at 50%,

20:36.830 --> 20:39.270
it'll hurt your company enough
to make this totally worthwhile.

20:39.305 --> 20:41.272
Plus, I get the land.

20:41.307 --> 20:43.538
So I guess I win. Twice.

20:43.573 --> 20:45.408
And yet
you're four times as obnoxious.

20:45.443 --> 20:47.036
But let me be clear:

20:47.071 --> 20:49.808
this ends our feud. Forever.

20:49.843 --> 20:51.843
And as a show of good faith...

20:57.081 --> 21:00.324
Deal. I'll have my lawyers
draft up the sale contract,

21:00.359 --> 21:03.294
and then we'll crack this open
and celebrate.

21:04.792 --> 21:06.660
Michelle?

21:09.434 --> 21:10.598
♪ ♪

21:17.002 --> 21:19.904
Oh, boy. Oh,
I-I was worried about that.

21:19.939 --> 21:21.741
Okay.
Thank you.

21:21.776 --> 21:24.711
Okay, I know not all of us
can age gracefully,

21:24.746 --> 21:26.845
but maybe get in the slow lane,
Dominique.

21:26.880 --> 21:28.044
It's not me
who's aging.

21:28.079 --> 21:29.518
It's this house.

21:29.553 --> 21:31.014
I tripped
on the back porch

21:31.049 --> 21:33.357
because the bottom step
is sinking,

21:33.392 --> 21:34.886
like everything else
in this place.

21:34.921 --> 21:37.823
Which is why I called
our engineer.

21:37.858 --> 21:39.022
I hope you
reach your point

21:39.057 --> 21:40.892
quicker
than you got down the hall.

21:40.927 --> 21:42.399
We rushed moving
the drill sites,

21:42.434 --> 21:44.401
so now the ground is unstable.

21:44.436 --> 21:46.535
The engineer recommends
we halt drilling

21:46.570 --> 21:48.097
and pay to stabilize the house

21:48.132 --> 21:49.967
to protect it
from sinking even more.

21:50.002 --> 21:53.773
I am not spending a dime
to patch a hypothetical problem.

21:53.808 --> 21:55.412
It's not hypothetical.

21:55.447 --> 21:58.074
And if you don't get ahead of it
and fix the problem now,

21:58.109 --> 22:00.417
the foundation
will probably crack.

22:00.452 --> 22:03.618
Or maybe you just had too much
to drink and slipped on a step.

22:03.653 --> 22:05.488
You're making
a mistake.

22:05.523 --> 22:07.490
I'm trying to help. Both of us.

22:07.525 --> 22:09.019
And I appreciate that.

22:09.054 --> 22:10.922
But let's worry
about getting our diamonds

22:10.957 --> 22:13.397
before Blake makes any headway
on that lawsuit.

22:13.432 --> 22:15.432
And then we can deal
with the house.

22:16.534 --> 22:18.369
Full drill ahead!

22:24.069 --> 22:25.607
All the vendors
have been confirmed.

22:25.642 --> 22:28.104
And I'll start helping
the volunteers

22:28.139 --> 22:29.512
stuff the gift bags next.

22:29.547 --> 22:31.140
Okay,
now you're just showing off.

22:31.175 --> 22:33.010
Relax.

22:33.045 --> 22:34.484
I'm kidding.

22:34.519 --> 22:35.111
But I'm pretty sure

22:35.146 --> 22:36.585
you missed one thing.

22:36.620 --> 22:37.850
Uh, no.

22:37.885 --> 22:38.950
I don't think so.

22:38.985 --> 22:40.424
What about the gift
you brought me?

22:40.459 --> 22:43.053
Oh, yeah.
Forgot about that.

22:43.088 --> 22:46.430
I was gonna wait until we were
alone to open it, but...

22:46.465 --> 22:47.827
couldn't help myself.

22:47.862 --> 22:49.994
It's incredible.

22:50.029 --> 22:51.897
Where did you even get this?

22:52.900 --> 22:54.702
It was my father's.

22:54.737 --> 22:56.407
And I thought you might want it.

22:56.442 --> 22:57.804
Did your father work here?

22:57.839 --> 22:59.005
No. No.

22:59.040 --> 23:01.841
One City, One Voice helped him
find his footing as a kid.

23:01.876 --> 23:04.613
After that, he stayed involved
for the rest of his life,

23:04.648 --> 23:07.913
which is why I wanted to
support this event specifically.

23:07.948 --> 23:09.585
Wow.

23:09.620 --> 23:11.114
You sure you want
to give this away?

23:11.149 --> 23:13.182
Yeah.

23:13.217 --> 23:15.459
This is where
he'd want it to go.

23:15.494 --> 23:18.187
And I hope it makes up for
the Mike the Bartender thing

23:18.222 --> 23:19.892
I pulled last week.

23:19.927 --> 23:23.434
I may be one
of those "rich guys,"

23:23.469 --> 23:24.765
but I'm here
for the right reasons.

23:24.800 --> 23:27.031
I have no doubt.

23:27.066 --> 23:28.670
Thank you for this.

23:31.873 --> 23:34.137
Guess we have more
in common than I thought.

23:41.685 --> 23:42.783
Did Alexis go for it?

23:42.818 --> 23:44.081
She knows
the house has issues,

23:44.116 --> 23:45.852
but she doesn't want
to do anything to fix them.

23:45.887 --> 23:47.084
Even after the
engineer's warnings?

23:47.119 --> 23:48.789
And the pictures and the doors

23:48.824 --> 23:50.186
and my twisted ankle.

23:50.221 --> 23:52.727
God, I thought she'd do
anything to protect the manor.

23:52.762 --> 23:54.729
After everything she went
through to steal it from me.

23:54.764 --> 23:56.665
I don't think she cares
about taking the manor

23:56.700 --> 23:58.667
as much as she cares
about taking it from you.

23:58.702 --> 24:00.537
Yeah.
She lives to
see you suffer.

24:00.572 --> 24:01.934
Yeah, yeah. She always has.

24:01.969 --> 24:04.805
Ever since I put that
eight-carat ring on her finger.

24:04.840 --> 24:06.675
Well, if what she wants
is to screw me over,

24:06.710 --> 24:07.874
let's use that against her.

24:07.909 --> 24:09.546
I'm one step ahead of you.

24:09.581 --> 24:10.580
Brother.

24:12.243 --> 24:13.715
Here.

24:14.685 --> 24:16.916
What, are you planning
on torturing her?

24:16.951 --> 24:18.555
I mean, I'm on the fence,
but I could be convinced.

24:18.590 --> 24:20.689
No torture.

24:20.724 --> 24:24.088
We are going to give Alexis
an opportunity to rip you off

24:24.123 --> 24:27.091
that'll be too tempting
to pass up.

24:29.194 --> 24:31.227
Colin's as connected
as a Kennedy,

24:31.262 --> 24:33.163
though having fancy
friends isn't a crime.

24:33.198 --> 24:35.704
Which is why, when I went back
into Colin's office,

24:35.739 --> 24:38.476
I made sure to snap
some shots of his calendar.

24:39.842 --> 24:41.710
Look, if we cross-check
the initials

24:41.745 --> 24:43.547
on the calendar
with the names on your list,

24:43.582 --> 24:45.142
maybe there's
a match somewhere

24:45.177 --> 24:46.583
that'll connect it
to the lawsuit.

24:46.618 --> 24:48.112
Like the meeting tonight
with M.P.

24:48.147 --> 24:50.213
Any M.P.s on that list?

24:50.248 --> 24:52.116
The only M.P. here
is State Attorney General

24:52.151 --> 24:53.590
Marshall Pintz.
Though I'm not sure

24:53.625 --> 24:55.559
why they'd be meeting in
East Atlanta at 9:00 p.m.

24:55.594 --> 24:58.859
Which is why we'll have
to go see for ourselves.

24:58.894 --> 25:00.630
Maybe he's bribing him.

25:00.665 --> 25:02.027
Are you suggesting
we surveil him?

25:02.062 --> 25:03.765
Obviously.

25:04.768 --> 25:05.767
Plus...

25:06.638 --> 25:08.638
...I have been dying

25:08.673 --> 25:10.772
to put this stakeoutfit
to use.

25:10.807 --> 25:12.070
Wow.

25:14.041 --> 25:15.645
I guess dreams do come true.

25:24.117 --> 25:25.754
I was starting to think

25:25.789 --> 25:26.887
you weren't going to make it.

25:26.922 --> 25:28.823
I come in peace.

25:28.858 --> 25:29.824
I promise.

25:29.859 --> 25:31.221
Yeah, I'm sure you do, but...

25:31.256 --> 25:33.564
I said everything
I needed to say.

25:33.599 --> 25:35.291
But I didn't.

25:35.326 --> 25:38.162
First of all,
I owe you an apology

25:38.197 --> 25:39.768
for bombarding you yesterday.
It wasn't fair.

25:39.803 --> 25:41.231
Or... professional.

25:41.266 --> 25:42.771
So...

25:42.806 --> 25:44.036
I'm sorry.

25:44.071 --> 25:46.170
Okay. That's
a good "first of all."

25:46.205 --> 25:49.041
And, second of all...

25:49.076 --> 25:51.648
I should've started with
an "I'm sorry for everything"

25:51.683 --> 25:53.947
instead of skipping right
to the "I want you back" bit.

25:53.982 --> 25:55.916
That would have been
a smoother transition.

25:55.951 --> 25:57.181
But it's the truth.

25:57.216 --> 25:59.084
I do want you back.

25:59.119 --> 26:00.756
I really miss you, Sam.

26:00.791 --> 26:02.318
You broke up with me.

26:02.353 --> 26:04.188
But I never stopped thinking
about you.

26:04.223 --> 26:05.222
Then why'd you leave?

26:07.127 --> 26:09.259
When Kirby told me
you were in love with me

26:09.294 --> 26:11.063
and that I needed
to figure out how I felt,

26:11.098 --> 26:12.669
I got scared.
I...

26:12.704 --> 26:14.066
I made
the safe choice.

26:14.101 --> 26:15.265
Kirby did what?

26:15.300 --> 26:17.135
You know what,
forget it.

26:17.170 --> 26:19.841
I'm glad Kirby said
whatever... she said.

26:19.876 --> 26:22.712
Because it forced me to move on

26:22.747 --> 26:24.912
and to realize that I deserve...

26:24.947 --> 26:26.716
someone to love me completely.

26:28.016 --> 26:29.785
Which is why I'm with Ryan now.

26:30.821 --> 26:32.216
You do deserve that.

26:32.251 --> 26:33.888
And more.

26:33.923 --> 26:34.988
But, uh...

26:36.024 --> 26:37.353
...where's Ryan now?

26:37.388 --> 26:38.893
He's not here.

26:38.928 --> 26:40.257
I am.

26:42.294 --> 26:44.668
You'll have all of me this time,
Sam.

26:44.703 --> 26:45.702
I promise.

26:48.904 --> 26:51.202
At the very least,
can I buy you a harmless

26:51.237 --> 26:53.171
"I'm sorry for everything,
I screwed up" drink?

26:53.206 --> 26:55.877
I don't know
if that's a good idea.

26:58.178 --> 26:59.947
<i> So, that's dizziness,</i>

26:59.982 --> 27:01.982
fainting, loss of appetite.

27:02.017 --> 27:03.115
Anything else?

27:03.150 --> 27:04.787
A few headaches.

27:04.822 --> 27:07.218
The same symptoms I had when
I was pregnant the first time.

27:07.253 --> 27:09.385
But my at-home test
was negative.

27:09.420 --> 27:11.662
I just want to know
what's wrong.

27:11.697 --> 27:13.796
Well, there's no need
to panic just yet.

27:13.831 --> 27:15.732
You actually could be pregnant.

27:15.767 --> 27:17.393
You might be shocked
to know

27:17.428 --> 27:20.869
that a $9.99 test
isn't always accurate.

27:20.904 --> 27:23.707
Would it matter that I
splurged on the $19.99 brand?

27:23.742 --> 27:26.006
We should take some blood,
just to be sure.

27:26.041 --> 27:28.140
This may be something
to celebrate after all.

27:30.144 --> 27:32.012
I can't tell what
you're more against,

27:32.047 --> 27:34.443
my proposing to Kirby
or you giving me a diamond.

27:34.478 --> 27:36.313
I'm not thrilled about either,
if you must know.

27:36.348 --> 27:39.921
Plus, I'm busy trying
to captain this run-down house.

27:39.956 --> 27:42.286
It's not easy
to find more Krug '88

27:42.321 --> 27:44.860
when the staff insists
that we're out.

27:44.895 --> 27:46.026
Anyway...

27:46.061 --> 27:48.160
just sleep on it for a few days.

27:48.195 --> 27:49.898
Or however long.

27:49.933 --> 27:51.394
Um, I can't sleep
on anything here.

27:51.429 --> 27:52.901
This place is creaking
like an old

27:52.936 --> 27:54.298
pirate ship.
Mm.

27:56.940 --> 27:58.368
More like the<i> Titanic.</i>

27:58.403 --> 28:00.238
Is something wrong
with this place?

28:00.273 --> 28:02.779
The house might be unstable
and sinking.

28:02.814 --> 28:05.177
The engineer recommended
a few fixes,

28:05.212 --> 28:07.047
but he didn't make it sound
like an emergency.

28:07.082 --> 28:08.785
If somebody comes to me
with a broken left arm,

28:08.820 --> 28:09.586
I don't tell 'em to come back

28:09.621 --> 28:10.919
when they've broken
their right one.

28:10.954 --> 28:11.786
While your point is vague,

28:11.822 --> 28:14.219
the foundation is
clearly compromised.

28:14.254 --> 28:16.122
And it will cost
too much to fix,

28:16.157 --> 28:17.321
and I don't want
to pay for that.

28:17.356 --> 28:18.993
Well, I would love
to stay and help,

28:19.028 --> 28:21.259
but, like you said,
you're the captain now.

28:21.294 --> 28:23.426
Mm.

28:23.461 --> 28:24.999
Hopefully not for long.

28:30.501 --> 28:32.468
Georges,
you still haven't told me

28:32.503 --> 28:35.471
why you tried to avoid
falling in love with me.

28:35.506 --> 28:36.338
You know,
usually on a stakeout,

28:36.374 --> 28:38.980
you don't park 20 feet
from your target.

28:39.015 --> 28:41.378
Well, our equipment isn't
exactly military-grade,

28:41.413 --> 28:42.852
and we need to
be close enough

28:42.887 --> 28:45.151
to be able to record
Colin's conversation

28:45.186 --> 28:46.856
with the attorney general.

28:55.130 --> 28:56.261
Mm.

29:00.267 --> 29:01.970
Okay.

29:02.005 --> 29:04.104
That was brilliant
and pretty hot.

29:04.139 --> 29:05.908
This ain't
my first drive-in.

29:05.943 --> 29:07.536
Mm.

29:07.571 --> 29:08.779
Wait, what is he doing?

29:08.814 --> 29:09.713
No.

29:09.749 --> 29:12.343
If he leaves, then we
can't blackmail him.

29:12.378 --> 29:14.147
He must really not like
this movie.

29:14.182 --> 29:15.412
It just started.

29:15.447 --> 29:16.479
Wait, wait, wait. Who's that?

29:17.315 --> 29:18.789
I knew it, I knew
it, I knew it.

29:18.824 --> 29:19.889
Here we go.

29:20.892 --> 29:22.859
Okay, I might have gotten

29:22.894 --> 29:23.926
this calendar-coded

29:23.961 --> 29:25.829
cross-checking initials
thing wrong.

29:25.864 --> 29:26.830
That is

29:26.865 --> 29:28.865
his assistant, Michelle.

29:28.900 --> 29:31.197
Whose last name
probably starts with a "P."

29:33.432 --> 29:35.003
Snap away.

29:39.911 --> 29:41.372
<i> That's it. Like a pendulum.</i>

29:41.407 --> 29:43.143
<i> Even pace, back and forth.</i>

29:44.179 --> 29:46.014
Nice!

29:46.049 --> 29:47.015
You win.

29:47.050 --> 29:48.412
All right, I'll finish up here.

29:48.447 --> 29:50.117
You lost?

29:50.152 --> 29:52.284
I thought you were supposed
to be a major golfer.

29:52.319 --> 29:54.154
Oh, I am.

29:54.189 --> 29:57.058
I just didn't want to end the
day with a crying volunteer.

29:57.093 --> 29:59.291
Well, looks like I'm the only
competition you have left.

29:59.326 --> 30:01.491
Oh, no, you-you got
a lot of work to do.

30:01.526 --> 30:04.230
Go home. I'll close up here.

30:04.265 --> 30:06.496
While your intention is noble,

30:06.531 --> 30:09.202
I can't help but think
you're ducking my challenge.

30:09.237 --> 30:11.204
Okay.

30:11.239 --> 30:12.238
Your loss.

30:21.348 --> 30:22.919
You can't laugh!

30:22.954 --> 30:24.052
That's cheating.

30:24.087 --> 30:25.416
I'm-I'm-I'm-I'm sorry.

30:25.451 --> 30:27.451
I thought you were kidding
with that form.

30:27.486 --> 30:30.058
Maybe you should help
instead of trash-talking.

30:30.093 --> 30:31.521
Okay.

30:31.556 --> 30:35.261
I'm just gonna sh-shift
your grip a little.

30:35.296 --> 30:37.032
Like this.

30:39.498 --> 30:41.300
♪ ♪

30:49.343 --> 30:51.178
Oh.

30:51.213 --> 30:52.949
When Colin sees
these photos,

30:52.984 --> 30:55.116
he is gonna drop
the suit faster

30:55.151 --> 30:56.381
than he dropped
his pants tonight.

30:56.416 --> 30:58.581
His wife is New York old money.

30:58.616 --> 31:01.419
You do not mess with a cult like
that and get away unscathed.

31:01.454 --> 31:04.125
God, he'll be ruined
if these get out.

31:04.160 --> 31:07.128
Exactly. Which is why he
will do whatever it takes

31:07.163 --> 31:08.657
to make sure they don't.

31:08.692 --> 31:10.967
And he says I
haven't changed. Ha!

31:11.002 --> 31:13.068
And this time Colin will be
the only one to pay the price,

31:13.103 --> 31:14.069
which is nice.

31:14.104 --> 31:15.235
What do you mean?

31:15.270 --> 31:16.500
Well, when he gets in trouble,

31:16.535 --> 31:18.271
he usually takes
someone down with him.

31:19.274 --> 31:21.076
He scapegoated his, uh--
his partner

31:21.111 --> 31:22.946
in a Securities
and Exchange investigation.

31:22.981 --> 31:24.673
And then he also got
that T.A. fired back at Wharton.

31:24.708 --> 31:25.982
Tyler Grace.

31:26.017 --> 31:28.677
Wait, Tyler Grace got fired?

31:28.712 --> 31:31.251
When the school discovered Colin
was stealing Tyler's tests,

31:31.286 --> 31:33.154
he got fired
a few weeks later, yeah.

31:33.189 --> 31:34.455
I had no idea.

31:34.491 --> 31:37.587
I mean, I was told that Tyler
was just taking a semester off.

31:37.622 --> 31:39.457
Oh, hey, hey, hey.
Don't feel bad.

31:39.492 --> 31:41.129
I mean, Fallon,
you didn't do anything wrong.

31:41.164 --> 31:43.263
Colin was the one who cheated
and involved Tyler.

31:43.298 --> 31:45.397
I know. It's just...

31:45.432 --> 31:48.598
I guess I hadn't thought
about the collateral damage.

31:48.633 --> 31:50.534
Look, usually, I'm the one
taking the moral high ground.

31:50.569 --> 31:52.206
Hey.

31:52.241 --> 31:53.702
Okay, you're right.

31:53.737 --> 31:56.309
But I think
that this is inbounds, Fallon.

31:56.344 --> 31:59.015
You're only using the photos
to force Colin's hand,

31:59.050 --> 32:01.182
not ruin anyone's life.

32:04.484 --> 32:07.122
Remember, you don't walk away.

32:09.093 --> 32:11.060
I'm here because your
claim against Dominique

32:11.095 --> 32:12.325
doesn't stand a chance.

32:12.360 --> 32:14.129
You know,
you could've just texted.

32:14.164 --> 32:15.361
There's more.

32:15.396 --> 32:16.659
Mm, always is with you.

32:16.694 --> 32:18.529
Since my initial offer
wasn't enough

32:18.564 --> 32:20.564
for your fragile ego,
I have a new one

32:20.599 --> 32:22.973
that will finally end
your incessant blabbing

32:23.008 --> 32:24.975
about your legacy.

32:25.010 --> 32:26.273
I will give you back the manor

32:26.308 --> 32:29.045
if you agree
to certain concessions.

32:29.080 --> 32:30.376
Such as?

32:30.411 --> 32:32.213
You drop
the mineral rights claim,

32:32.248 --> 32:33.676
you let us keep digging,

32:33.711 --> 32:35.579
and we get it all in writing.

32:35.614 --> 32:38.582
Well, I have to admit,
the last few months

32:38.617 --> 32:42.025
have made me see
what's really important.

32:42.060 --> 32:45.996
After all,
it is my legacy and my house.

32:46.031 --> 32:47.327
Mm.

32:47.362 --> 32:48.559
All right.

32:48.594 --> 32:50.099
You can keep your diamonds

32:50.134 --> 32:51.496
as long as you include the loft.

32:51.531 --> 32:54.070
I want you
completely off the property.
Fine.

32:54.105 --> 32:55.434
We'll add an
addendum later.

32:55.469 --> 32:57.172
I appreciate your generosity,

32:57.207 --> 32:59.174
so I'll give you a full 24 hours

32:59.209 --> 33:00.307
to vacate the premises.

33:01.673 --> 33:04.674
Oh, don't worry.
I'll be out in 12.

33:04.709 --> 33:08.249
It's you
who'll be vacating in 24.

33:32.572 --> 33:35.540
Morning, handsome.

33:35.575 --> 33:38.510
Sorry. I didn't mean
to wake you.

33:38.545 --> 33:40.512
Ooh, my headache
had that handled.

33:42.813 --> 33:44.384
But starting the
day in your arms

33:44.419 --> 33:47.420
makes this savage
hangover so worth it.

33:50.194 --> 33:52.524
You do it to yourself,

33:52.559 --> 33:54.658
and that's why it really hurts.

33:54.693 --> 33:57.826
It's funny. You're quoting
my favorite Wharbler song.

33:57.861 --> 34:00.136
Though a tad disturbing
you still know it.

34:00.171 --> 34:02.666
But, as Radiohead
indeed predicted,

34:02.701 --> 34:06.835
you, my dear,
did do it to yourself.

34:06.870 --> 34:10.674
Hmm.
And I hope you can walk away
with a lesson learned.

34:10.709 --> 34:13.149
Oh, I learned my lesson.

34:13.184 --> 34:16.449
And I won't be signing
a damn thing today.

34:17.716 --> 34:21.487
After you claimed that all I do
is take out my competition

34:21.522 --> 34:23.159
to get what I want,
I started to think

34:23.194 --> 34:25.194
about the girl I was
back at Wharton.

34:25.229 --> 34:28.296
Even though I'm opposed
to self-reflection as a rule.

34:28.331 --> 34:29.594
But you were half right.

34:29.629 --> 34:30.826
I did out you for cheating

34:30.861 --> 34:32.300
so I'd be first
in the class.

34:32.335 --> 34:34.203
That Fallon was too insecure

34:34.238 --> 34:36.568
to think
that she could beat a cheater.

34:38.803 --> 34:42.112
What am I supposed
to be looking at here?
Proof.

34:42.147 --> 34:43.806
I am no longer the girl

34:43.841 --> 34:45.313
that outed you at Wharton.

34:45.348 --> 34:49.317
I am Fallon friggin'
Carrington, CEO.

34:49.352 --> 34:51.550
And sure,
I could've destroyed you,

34:51.585 --> 34:54.124
but I didn't want
to stoop to your level.

34:54.159 --> 34:56.687
So I conceded the claim
to the courts an hour ago.

34:56.722 --> 35:00.394
That land is now
officially a historic landmark.

35:00.429 --> 35:03.463
So you can't build on it.
The land is still useless.

35:03.498 --> 35:04.860
Wrong.

35:04.895 --> 35:08.468
According to Code 893,

35:08.503 --> 35:11.240
if I accept
the historical designation

35:11.275 --> 35:13.671
and agree to pay
for the castle's restoration,

35:13.706 --> 35:15.739
then I can start building
my campus

35:15.774 --> 35:18.676
as long as I leave
a 500-foot radius

35:18.711 --> 35:20.315
around the monument.

35:20.350 --> 35:21.415
Now, I know
you struggled in math,

35:21.450 --> 35:23.285
so I'll make it really easy
for you.

35:23.320 --> 35:25.353
It's not gonna be a problem.
So,

35:25.388 --> 35:27.685
you agreed to spend millions
to restore a castle

35:27.720 --> 35:30.655
and to redesign your campus
just to spite me?

35:30.690 --> 35:33.328
Oh, don't flatter yourself.
It's just business.

35:33.363 --> 35:35.891
That location will be worth
triple the value now.

35:35.926 --> 35:37.431
You may think

35:37.466 --> 35:40.632
you won this battle,
but this is war.
Uh-huh.

35:40.667 --> 35:41.633
Michelle!

35:41.668 --> 35:43.602
Hey.

35:43.637 --> 35:47.210
Next time, at least make him buy
you soda and a popcorn first.

35:47.245 --> 35:48.673
What?

35:49.742 --> 35:52.776
Double oat milk capp,
extra foam.

35:52.811 --> 35:56.219
You seem pretty perky for
somebody on mail room duty.

35:56.254 --> 35:58.782
I can't stop thinking
about our kiss last night.

35:58.817 --> 36:00.520
You should be thinking
about your putting.

36:00.555 --> 36:02.357
But,

36:02.392 --> 36:04.689
yes, the kiss was great.

36:04.724 --> 36:06.427
I don't want to kill the vibe,

36:06.462 --> 36:08.825
but I got to be straight
with Jeff.

36:08.860 --> 36:10.233
So do you want me to tell him,

36:10.268 --> 36:11.630
or do you want
to let him down first?

36:11.665 --> 36:14.303
Let him down?
Why would I do that?

36:15.438 --> 36:18.175
I like you both, so I was
planning on dating you both.

36:19.706 --> 36:21.706
You don't have an issue
with that, do you?

36:24.876 --> 36:26.678
Oh. Duty calls.

36:26.713 --> 36:28.317
Literally.

36:28.352 --> 36:29.846
<i> I got to admit,</i>

36:29.881 --> 36:33.421
your fake foundation flood
was genius.

36:33.456 --> 36:35.390
Alexis was foaming
at the mouth

36:35.425 --> 36:36.324
to screw me over.

36:36.360 --> 36:38.822
You-you deserve
your half of the manor.

36:38.857 --> 36:40.593
I wish I was
in a more celebratory mood.

36:40.628 --> 36:41.957
I thought

36:41.992 --> 36:43.431
by taking something from Thomas,

36:43.466 --> 36:45.301
it would fill
the emptiness he left in me.

36:45.336 --> 36:46.896
Wow.
But it hasn't.

36:46.931 --> 36:49.701
Probably because
he's still everywhere here.

36:49.736 --> 36:51.439
You can keep my half.

36:51.474 --> 36:53.705
Yeah, but I don't have
anything else to offer.

36:53.740 --> 36:55.003
Actually,

36:55.038 --> 36:57.577
you do. I'd like the loft.

36:57.612 --> 36:59.909
I want to convert it
into a space to honor my mother

36:59.944 --> 37:02.351
by making her fashion dreams
come true.

37:02.386 --> 37:04.848
If that's what you want,
I think we can do that.

37:04.883 --> 37:07.653
I do. Thank you.

37:07.688 --> 37:10.722
Why are my silks
packed in with the cashmere?

37:10.757 --> 37:13.725
I just hope
that you are savoring

37:13.760 --> 37:15.991
your final few moments
in the manor.
I'm fine.

37:16.026 --> 37:18.334
And with the diamonds you
signed over, I'll be able to buy

37:18.369 --> 37:21.370
ten manors that aren't
sinking into the ground.

37:26.674 --> 37:29.642
I'm not kidding.
Your old new house

37:29.677 --> 37:31.677
has a sinking foundation.
Oh.

37:31.712 --> 37:32.678
It's not funny.
No.

37:32.713 --> 37:34.944
I just find it hilarious
that some superglue

37:34.979 --> 37:38.486
and garden hose,
some creaky ship sound effects

37:38.521 --> 37:39.982
could so easily fool you.

37:40.017 --> 37:41.918
There's nothing actually wrong
with this house.

37:41.953 --> 37:44.690
Even if that were true,
I have miles of diamonds

37:44.725 --> 37:47.429
and mountains of cash
while you just have

37:47.464 --> 37:49.431
this gaudy relic.

37:49.466 --> 37:51.301
Well, do you want to know
something else that's funny?

37:51.336 --> 37:53.402
No, but I'm sure
you're going to tell me anyway.

37:53.437 --> 37:56.636
Thomas had a survey done
of the property a long time ago,

37:56.671 --> 38:00.838
and they came up empty,
so you traded a nonsinking house

38:00.873 --> 38:02.741
for an empty hole in the ground.

38:02.776 --> 38:05.777
You're usually a better liar.
No, I'm not lying.

38:05.812 --> 38:06.878
But your mineralogist

38:06.913 --> 38:10.045
and my close, personal friend
Nicole was lying to you

38:10.080 --> 38:12.949
when she told you that there was
anything of value in that mine.

38:12.984 --> 38:15.083
I can show you the real survey
if you don't believe me.

38:15.118 --> 38:17.360
You won't get away with this.

38:17.395 --> 38:18.889
I think that I already did.

38:18.924 --> 38:20.462
But, hey,
I'm a man of my word,

38:20.497 --> 38:22.365
and I will give you
the full 24 hours

38:22.400 --> 38:23.597
to vacate the premises.

38:25.469 --> 38:28.437
You know, I would say
that payback is a bitch,

38:28.472 --> 38:31.803
but that title is reserved
exclusively for you.

38:34.742 --> 38:36.577
So, he never saw the pictures?

38:36.612 --> 38:37.974
Nope.

38:38.009 --> 38:39.778
I realized that I had a chance

38:39.813 --> 38:42.352
to prove I've changed
since my Wharton days.

38:42.387 --> 38:44.519
And I didn't want to cause
any collateral damage this time.

38:45.654 --> 38:47.522
Now who took
the moral high ground?

38:47.557 --> 38:49.821
I know. I just feel
like I failed you here.

38:49.856 --> 38:51.658
No. No, no, no, no, no.

38:51.693 --> 38:54.397
I needed to figure
this one out on my own.

38:54.432 --> 38:56.091
Hey, it wasn't all bad.

38:56.126 --> 38:57.796
I still have that stakeoutfit.

38:57.831 --> 38:59.930
Oh. Love that.

39:02.099 --> 39:05.034
Sorry to interrupt,
but I believe

39:05.069 --> 39:06.838
this is my study... again.

39:06.873 --> 39:08.708
Hey, I heard the good news.

39:08.743 --> 39:10.743
Sounds like we all have
a reason to celebrate.

39:10.778 --> 39:12.778
We can continue
celebrating later.
Mm-hmm.

39:14.948 --> 39:18.685
Any thoughts on paying
for the castle restoration?

39:18.720 --> 39:20.885
We squeezed our finances
pretty tight

39:20.920 --> 39:21.952
to pay for the land.

39:21.987 --> 39:24.152
Actually, yes.

39:24.187 --> 39:26.990
I am pulling up the plans
to take the company public.

39:27.025 --> 39:29.696
We can generate capital
to pay the debt

39:29.731 --> 39:32.094
and fortify ourselves against
any future hostile run-ins.

39:32.129 --> 39:34.569
Pulling those plans up
by a year is a really big deal.

39:34.604 --> 39:36.571
Well, someone once told me

39:36.606 --> 39:39.475
you can't build a dynasty
by playing it safe.

39:41.138 --> 39:42.775
That person
sounds very wise.

39:43.811 --> 39:45.646
<i> I am honored</i>

39:45.681 --> 39:47.109
to be your new
chief of staff.

39:47.144 --> 39:48.913
Uh, I promise to
do you all proud.

39:48.948 --> 39:51.388
Thank you.
Thank you.

39:53.051 --> 39:54.886
Cristal? You okay?

39:54.921 --> 39:57.625
Um, I was just with my doctor.

39:57.660 --> 39:58.492
Uh, I...

39:58.528 --> 40:01.024
I-I thought I might be pregnant,
but...

40:01.059 --> 40:03.763
I-I didn't know where to go

40:03.798 --> 40:05.831
or who to talk to.
Where's Blake?

40:05.866 --> 40:07.866
Did something happen?
I can't talk to Blake yet

40:07.901 --> 40:10.033
because I'm-I'm not pregnant.

40:11.168 --> 40:13.509
Apparently, I have, um,

40:13.544 --> 40:15.511
some kind of growth

40:15.546 --> 40:17.139
pressing on a nerve.

40:17.174 --> 40:19.141
And she said I...

40:19.176 --> 40:22.045
I have a brain tumor.

40:28.526 --> 40:29.888
Thomas Carrington,

40:29.923 --> 40:33.155
I will never understand
why you betrayed my mother,

40:33.190 --> 40:35.091
why you rejected me

40:35.126 --> 40:39.931
or why you left me with
this worthless property deed.

40:41.539 --> 40:45.035
But I am done wasting my time

40:45.070 --> 40:48.676
trying to untangle your cruelty.

40:51.912 --> 40:54.814
I vow to nurture

40:54.849 --> 40:56.783
the people I neglected

40:56.818 --> 40:59.522
during my quest
for your acceptance.

40:59.557 --> 41:03.724
Goodbye and good riddance.

41:03.759 --> 41:06.892
You two-timing tramp.

41:06.927 --> 41:09.895
How could you do this to me?
We were partners.

41:09.930 --> 41:13.261
Partners? You're as delusional
as you are desperate.

41:13.296 --> 41:17.199
Why would you help that
despicable, disgusting bastard?

41:17.234 --> 41:18.673
Because, unlike you,

41:18.708 --> 41:20.741
he wasn't trying
to screw me over

41:20.776 --> 41:22.512
every step of the way.

41:22.547 --> 41:26.241
You got what you deserved,
you self-serving snake.
