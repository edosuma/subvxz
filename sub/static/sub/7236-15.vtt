<i>Accessing archive data...</i>

00:07.492 --> 00:11.237
<i>Zed's distaste for the
Renegade continues to grow...</i>

00:11.427 --> 00:12.979
<i>No, wait! That's my bike!</i>

00:13.248 --> 00:16.931
The Renegade stole your bike.
Do you like being a laughing stock?

00:17.146 --> 00:21.316
It's time for everyone in Argon to find
out what a fraud this Renegade really is.

00:21.477 --> 00:24.907
You don't think there's even a chance
he could actually be Tron?

00:25.016 --> 00:27.733
<i>As does Mara believe
to the Renegade's cause.</i>

00:27.832 --> 00:31.103
He is risking his life out there,
and he needs our help.

00:31.384 --> 00:34.900
I don't know how about you guys,
but I'm giving it to him.

00:41.156 --> 00:43.747
Will you just hear me out?

00:45.674 --> 00:48.026
Fine, then at least come with me.

00:49.274 --> 00:52.670
Wait, stop! You're not yourself.

00:53.276 --> 00:57.999
Help me kill the Renegade,
or get out of my way!

00:59.350 --> 01:00.833
Wait!

01:07.040 --> 01:08.854
Mara!

01:18.421 --> 01:21.782
Which one says, "Overthrow Clu"?

01:22.036 --> 01:24.256
Oh, I could pull this off.
Don't you think?

01:24.365 --> 01:25.561
<i>No.</i>

01:25.791 --> 01:27.913
Who asked you?

01:50.977 --> 02:00.426
<b>S01E15 - State of Mind </b>

02:03.200 --> 02:06.960
<i>All incoming test subjects

02:07.115 --> 02:11.163
<i>Please direct infected

02:16.898 --> 02:19.647
<i>It's okay, you're in gifted hands.</i>

02:19.845 --> 02:22.090
Zed will take good care of you.

02:22.302 --> 02:25.262
Plus, I know you'd never
leave me for the Renegade.

02:25.536 --> 02:27.920
Should I be worried that
you're talking to your bike?

02:28.049 --> 02:29.298
Can you blame me?

02:29.397 --> 02:32.245
Going a little stir-crazy
from pulling all these double-shifts.

02:32.353 --> 02:34.831
'Cause someone's never here.

02:35.541 --> 02:37.910
I am here now. Let me help.

02:38.046 --> 02:41.131
You wanna help? Get my old
bike back from the Renegade.

02:41.302 --> 02:44.322
You're not still sore
about that, are you?

02:44.454 --> 02:47.587
I just wish he'd be
on my side, for once.

02:48.009 --> 02:49.975
Like you used to be.

02:56.125 --> 02:58.222
You just get back?
Everything go okay?

02:58.544 --> 03:00.224
- Yep.
- <i>No.</i>

03:01.326 --> 03:04.482
There was a minor fender-bender.

03:04.713 --> 03:07.097
But... I'm fine.

03:07.245 --> 03:09.930
Better than fine. I feel...

03:10.467 --> 03:15.394
...purified.
Like everything's finally in focus.

03:15.606 --> 03:19.447
You're sure you didn't
hit your head or anything?

03:22.854 --> 03:26.127
<i>Accidents put things in perspective...</i>

03:26.421 --> 03:29.080
<i>and it just... look outside.</i>

03:29.278 --> 03:32.075
<i>I see Recognizers, lots of them.</i>

03:32.239 --> 03:35.813
Exactly... they are so...

03:35.936 --> 03:37.777
beautiful.

03:38.434 --> 03:42.206
Beautiful? Where did she
said the accident was?

03:42.428 --> 03:44.482
She didn't.

03:44.903 --> 03:47.890
- But it's nothing to worry about.
- Are you blind?

03:48.015 --> 03:50.691
Something is obviously
wrong with our friend!

03:50.907 --> 03:54.196
Shouldn't we be doing
something about it?

04:09.114 --> 04:12.837
<i>Attention: Incoming patients.</i>

04:12.838 --> 04:15.320
<i>Please prep for examination.</i>

04:24.586 --> 04:27.612
The pathogen code
is bonded with a trial proof, General.

04:27.824 --> 04:32.955
- Phase 1 is successful.
- Phase 1 is complete, Keller!

04:33.105 --> 04:35.792
Success will be determined
when you finish your job..

04:35.984 --> 04:38.616
What job? Mind control?

04:38.810 --> 04:42.672
<i>I'm a scientist. I designed
these agents to liberate programs,</i>

04:42.905 --> 04:44.893
<i>and you're using them to make slaves.</i>

04:45.023 --> 04:47.022
<i>I'm making believers.</i>

04:47.203 --> 04:50.798
You've seen the streets?
Poluted with the scent?

04:51.019 --> 04:53.258
We need to put a stop to this.

04:53.429 --> 04:56.469
I can't. I want... out.

04:56.470 --> 04:57.470
Hmm.

04:58.091 --> 05:02.481
Let me make this easy for you.
You walk away,

05:02.611 --> 05:06.029
and I let Pavel
tear the code from your body.

05:06.157 --> 05:09.816
You run, and I'll derezz you myself.

05:11.182 --> 05:14.668
We'll give you a moment
to think it over.

05:26.087 --> 05:29.840
<i>- You bypassed the code?
- Of course you're invited, Hopper.</i>

05:30.008 --> 05:32.019
<i>Wouldn't be a party
without the two of you.</i>

05:32.175 --> 05:36.499
- Eh... are you sure?
- Mara? What are you doing?

05:36.724 --> 05:41.220
Recruiting. Tesler's throwing
a celebration and we weren't invited..

05:41.564 --> 05:43.759
Mara, lets go. This isn't you.

05:43.902 --> 05:46.679
No, Zed. It is me.

05:46.799 --> 05:50.216
Clu will bring order to the Grid.
And when he does...

05:50.313 --> 05:56.009
he'll reward those who stood by aside.
His loyal supporters.

05:58.272 --> 06:00.964
I wonder what the Renegade
would said to that...

06:01.628 --> 06:05.332
- Mara, stop!
- You know the Renegade?

06:05.506 --> 06:08.649
- Tell me where to find him!
- What's wrong with you?

06:08.791 --> 06:11.502
The Renegade is perverting the system,

06:11.667 --> 06:14.554
spreading lies about our glorious leader.

06:14.762 --> 06:18.169
- Should we step in?
- What, spoil the fun?

06:18.425 --> 06:21.589
I wanna see if she'll rip his arms off.

06:21.590 --> 06:22.590
Oh.

06:23.166 --> 06:28.179
Let's go, we've got a party to attend...
and we don't wanna be late.

06:28.380 --> 06:32.701
- We'd ask you to come...
- ...but we don't like you.

06:39.653 --> 06:41.642
<i>Please join us for music,</i>

06:41.808 --> 06:43.991
<i>- mainly at Argon Square.
- My treat..</i>

06:44.167 --> 06:47.615
<i>Because you deserve it, programs.</i>

06:48.044 --> 06:51.169
Since when does Tesler throw parties?

07:08.184 --> 07:11.436
<i>Hold it right there, Renegade.</i>

07:21.130 --> 07:23.635
Go home before you'll got hurt.

07:23.750 --> 07:25.001
No!

07:25.931 --> 07:28.632
- Don't push me.
<i>- Don't-push-me...</i>

07:28.856 --> 07:31.156
What is it with you?
Do you wanna get derezzed?

07:31.337 --> 07:34.028
What I want is to help my friend, Mara.

07:34.159 --> 07:36.158
See this accident?
She was in it.

07:36.292 --> 07:38.872
And suddenly losing her head..

07:39.143 --> 07:41.825
And my other friend, the one program

07:41.983 --> 07:44.805
who should be helpin' me,
is nowhere to be found.

07:45.884 --> 07:49.514
Why am I telling you?
He's not your friend.

07:49.925 --> 07:53.296
I'm starting to think he's my either.

07:54.246 --> 07:55.889
What's this?

07:57.998 --> 08:01.911
<i>Obviously a clue.
You can thank me later.</i>

08:03.325 --> 08:07.840
<i>See that? The tanker is
a drone, driven by remote.</i>

08:09.237 --> 08:14.323
- Good thing, one of us is a mechanic.
- We'll see what we can fix up..

08:28.348 --> 08:33.163
- The tanker was programmed to crash.
- Way ahead of you. Try to keep up.

08:33.402 --> 08:36.822
And it wasn't the only tank
that crashed in this cycle.

08:37.527 --> 08:40.693
Why would someone crash
six of their own trucks?

08:46.675 --> 08:48.609
Anyone for seven?

08:52.319 --> 08:54.887
We need to catch that truck
before it crashes.

08:55.082 --> 08:58.561
- Try to keep up.
- Try not to make me hate you.

09:09.840 --> 09:14.069
- Now what?
- How is turning radius on that thing?

09:14.442 --> 09:16.669
<i>Turning what?</i>

09:19.377 --> 09:22.483
<i>Hey!
Watch where you're going, you fool!</i>

09:34.742 --> 09:38.500
<i>What happend to:
"making me not hate you"?</i>

09:39.429 --> 09:41.970
Well, this certain won't help.

09:43.724 --> 09:47.069
- The truck. We're on it.
- Not yet.

09:50.633 --> 09:54.125
- You're very popular.
- I'm not here to make friends.

09:54.300 --> 09:56.072
Let me handle this.

10:40.820 --> 10:42.784
Let's go.

10:54.940 --> 10:57.322
Oh. This is not good.

11:04.235 --> 11:08.217
Now you owe me... two bikes.

11:11.287 --> 11:13.909
According to this, the tanker
is going to crash in the tunnel.

11:14.030 --> 11:15.871
You mean that tunnel?

11:16.047 --> 11:18.080
We need to switch that
thing back over to manual.

11:18.279 --> 11:22.237
Hey, take the wheel. When I'll say
so, you cut knife the truck..

11:24.263 --> 11:26.717
Ready? Now!

11:38.510 --> 11:41.985
- Now what?
- You're asking me?

11:43.073 --> 11:46.609
We have to jump. Now!

11:56.898 --> 11:59.395
Heh. That's hilarious.

12:05.100 --> 12:07.068
Now, how we'll stop these trucks?

12:07.239 --> 12:10.587
- Follow the victims.
- I knew that.

12:26.150 --> 12:28.314
- Zed!
- What? I'm fine.

12:34.044 --> 12:36.824
Why is it taking you so long?

12:37.467 --> 12:40.036
It's a complicated process.

12:40.373 --> 12:44.062
And order to activate the pathogen
in code, it needs to be done right.

12:44.317 --> 12:47.224
I'm going to pretend,
I know what that means.

12:47.514 --> 12:51.479
<i>I'm talking about
activating the orange... stuff.</i>

13:03.052 --> 13:06.032
<i>I need to finish calibrating this antenna.</i>

13:06.711 --> 13:09.408
Why are you telling me?
Do it already.

13:09.667 --> 13:13.229
And pick up the pace.
The party's waiting.

13:19.148 --> 13:21.850
That tower has to control every mind...

13:22.105 --> 13:25.454
and anyone else who breathes
even a spec of that orange stuff.

13:25.843 --> 13:30.572
So in theory, if we destroy the tower,
everyone goes back to normal?

13:30.781 --> 13:32.807
You happen to have
a spare megabomb, are you?

13:33.118 --> 13:35.914
<i>Eligible launch in progess..</i>

13:37.051 --> 13:41.613
<i>For your safe, stand clear off doors.</i>

13:43.190 --> 13:46.268
I do now. Come on.

13:56.809 --> 13:57.809
Ahh!

14:03.922 --> 14:06.274
<i>Greetings, programs.</i>

14:06.449 --> 14:08.930
<i>We are delighted you did join us.</i>

14:09.105 --> 14:12.107
<i>Pleace gather a square for best view.</i>

14:12.336 --> 14:14.982
<i>The event will begin shortly.</i>

14:19.603 --> 14:21.814
<i>- Whoa!
- What is it?</i>

14:37.907 --> 14:39.602
Yeah! Whoo!

14:58.819 --> 15:02.392
Good thinking. Don't want
those guards coming after you later.

15:02.509 --> 15:06.108
It's not for them.
I'd rather not inhale any of that.

15:38.391 --> 15:44.670
<i>Clu! Clu! Clu!</i>

15:47.274 --> 15:51.945
We can't leave Mara alone down there.
I'm going after her.

15:53.202 --> 15:57.072
- She must mean a lot to you.
- More than you'll ever know.

15:57.468 --> 15:59.744
Your friends are lucky
to have you looking out for them.

16:00.070 --> 16:03.007
Fly with your arms and legs out,
and land with your feet moving.

16:03.240 --> 16:05.755
I got it.
I've used a wingshoot before.

16:06.018 --> 16:08.363
- No, you haven't.
- Ok, I've seen it done.

16:08.592 --> 16:11.725
How hard can it be?

16:24.348 --> 16:26.545
Watch your hands, guys.

16:29.931 --> 16:31.728
Why that long face?

16:31.848 --> 16:35.573
We should be celebrating.
Together.

16:35.785 --> 16:38.829
You'd have to give me
some other ideas, first.

16:38.994 --> 16:41.376
That can be arranged.

16:55.348 --> 16:58.721
Excuse me?
Same program is going thru!

17:02.649 --> 17:04.419
Mara!

17:04.867 --> 17:07.273
Zed! You came after all!

17:07.550 --> 17:12.337
- Long live Clu!
- Yeah, long live... hmm.

17:12.657 --> 17:15.512
- Hey!
- You'll thank me for this later.

17:17.328 --> 17:20.538
- You!
- I'm setting an alternative course.

17:20.798 --> 17:25.125
You can leave now...
or stick around for the fireworks.

17:25.526 --> 17:27.823
I love fireworks!

17:40.633 --> 17:42.884
That was fun.

17:45.053 --> 17:48.603
Zed, stop!
We'll missing the party!

17:48.848 --> 17:52.056
Really?
Looked like it was dying down.

17:53.103 --> 17:54.812
Mara, please!

17:55.092 --> 17:58.221
You have to go back to the garage!
It's not safe here!

18:01.088 --> 18:03.623
Blasphemy!.

18:11.921 --> 18:15.910
Mara! Can you just hear me out?

18:18.623 --> 18:21.571
Fine, then at least come with me.

18:32.588 --> 18:37.389
Help me kill the Renegade,
or get out of my way!

18:39.351 --> 18:40.803
Wait!

18:55.548 --> 18:57.584
I had him... you know...

18:57.803 --> 19:01.059
Yeah. I still needed to do that.

19:08.832 --> 19:10.603
Run!

19:39.760 --> 19:43.866
Oh. What happened?
How did I get here?

19:44.122 --> 19:47.358
Long story.
Just answer me one thing:

19:47.552 --> 19:51.095
What are your feelings
about the Renegade?

19:51.977 --> 19:56.347
- Oh, Zed...
- we have to have this argument again?.

19:56.548 --> 19:58.911
You know, I think he's doing good.

19:58.912 --> 20:01.274
Would you just get over it already?

20:01.938 --> 20:04.851
I'll try to work on that.

20:08.570 --> 20:10.805
- Where is Mara?
- Upstairs.

20:11.013 --> 20:13.160
Recoding her hairstyle.

20:13.422 --> 20:15.737
She turned it orange.

20:16.565 --> 20:19.125
She turned her hair orange?

20:19.398 --> 20:22.597
I met the Renegade, again.
You know what?

20:22.798 --> 20:24.590
He's not that bad.

20:24.785 --> 20:28.535
Oh. So you and
the Renegade are best friends now?

20:28.715 --> 20:31.318
I don't know if I'd go that far, but...

20:31.553 --> 20:34.828
I did teach him
how to use a wingshoot.

20:35.801 --> 20:38.617
My old bike!

20:46.267 --> 20:47.676
<i>Yes.</i>

21:01.498 --> 21:06.834
Where have you been?
I want this tower reconstructed, now!

21:07.110 --> 21:09.194
I'm afraid it won't do any good, sir.

21:09.450 --> 21:12.199
Keller betrayed us
by sabotaging her own tower!

21:12.430 --> 21:15.327
She neutralized the pathogen.

21:16.066 --> 21:18.842
<i>Then find Keller.</i>

21:21.146 --> 21:24.343
<i>And neutralize her.</i>
