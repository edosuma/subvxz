[cheers and applause]

00:41.433 --> 00:43.266
- Welcome, welcome, welcome

00:43.266 --> 00:44.266
to "Last Week Tonight."

00:44.266 --> 00:45.200
I'm John Oliver.

00:45.200 --> 00:47.400
Thank you so much
for joining us.

00:47.400 --> 00:50.166
And we begin tonight
with President Trump--

00:50.166 --> 00:52.734
two words that continue
to sound wrong together,

00:52.734 --> 00:57.100
sort of like "horse pope"
or "Dr. Oz."

00:57.100 --> 01:00.433
And this was a week of diplomacy
for the president.

01:00.433 --> 01:03.600
Or, as it turned out,
the opposite of that.

01:03.600 --> 01:05.967
- President Trump hosting
Chancellor Angela Merkel

01:05.967 --> 01:07.333
at the White House today.

01:07.333 --> 01:09.400
It will be their first
face-to-face meeting

01:09.400 --> 01:11.333
since Mr. Trump
ridiculed the chancellor

01:11.333 --> 01:15.633
on the campaign trail, accusing
her of "ruining Germany."

01:15.633 --> 01:16.800
- Wow.

01:16.800 --> 01:19.400
Well, first,
that is a major insult,

01:19.400 --> 01:21.100
because, historically,
the title of

01:21.100 --> 01:23.367
"chancellor synonymous
with ruining Germany"

01:23.367 --> 01:25.567
is pretty much taken.

01:25.567 --> 01:27.900
And second,
it's got to be awkward

01:27.900 --> 01:30.567
to meet someone that you've
talked so much shit about.

01:30.567 --> 01:32.834
Personally, that is why
I never leave the house,

01:32.834 --> 01:36.934
because I know Johnny Depp
is somewhere out there,

01:36.934 --> 01:40.166
presumably vaping
into a supermodel's vagina

01:40.166 --> 01:42.033
while he mansplains acting.

01:42.033 --> 01:44.266
And--and if you are thinking

01:44.266 --> 01:45.633
that Trump made
an extra effort

01:45.633 --> 01:47.600
to smooth things over,
you would be wrong,

01:47.600 --> 01:48.967
because watch what happened

01:48.967 --> 01:52.600
when the media at a photo op
made a very routine request.

02:03.200 --> 02:07.567
- Oh, shake her hand,
you weird, weird man!

02:07.567 --> 02:10.400
It is not often
that you can genuinely say,

02:10.400 --> 02:13.233
"Trump really should have
touched that woman."

02:13.233 --> 02:15.000
Because--look at him!

02:15.000 --> 02:17.500
He's just staring
straight ahead,

02:17.500 --> 02:19.667
refusing to make eye contact!

02:19.667 --> 02:21.667
He's treating
the Chancellor of Germany

02:21.667 --> 02:25.133
like a drunk guy
masturbating in a subway car.

02:25.133 --> 02:26.967
And it did not get
any less tense

02:26.967 --> 02:29.533
at their joint press conference,
'cause as you probably know,

02:29.533 --> 02:31.700
Trump has been standing by
his nonsensical claim

02:31.700 --> 02:33.700
that President Obama
had him wiretapped,

02:33.700 --> 02:35.967
and when a German reporter
asked him about that,

02:35.967 --> 02:39.066
he tried to pull Merkel into it
with him.

02:39.066 --> 02:42.400
- As far as, uh,
wiretapping,

02:42.400 --> 02:45.934
I guess, by, you know,
this past administration,

02:45.934 --> 02:49.967
at least we have something
in common, perhaps.

02:49.967 --> 02:52.333
[audience laughter]

02:52.333 --> 02:55.567
- Now, what that very funny joke
is referring to

02:55.567 --> 02:58.467
is the allegation that the U.S.
had monitored Merkel's phone,

02:58.467 --> 03:00.734
and she is not amused by that.

03:00.734 --> 03:02.600
In fact, that may be
the most uncomfortable

03:02.600 --> 03:04.367
a U.S. president
has ever made her.

03:04.367 --> 03:06.200
And I will remind you,
George W. Bush

03:06.200 --> 03:10.867
once gave her an unsolicited
surprise back rub.

03:10.867 --> 03:12.200
And it wasn't just Germany

03:12.200 --> 03:13.867
dragged into
Trump's wiretapping mess,

03:13.867 --> 03:15.233
because his press secretary

03:15.233 --> 03:17.166
and special guest on
the "Gilmore Girls" reboot

03:17.166 --> 03:18.600
Melissa McCarthy

03:18.600 --> 03:22.734
suddenly brought a British
spy agency into it too.

03:22.734 --> 03:24.900
- Sean Spicer, the president's
press secretary,

03:24.900 --> 03:27.667
has backed claims
that GCHQ was involved

03:27.667 --> 03:31.066
in tapping phones
for Barack Obama.

03:31.066 --> 03:32.433
- He didn't use the NSA,

03:32.433 --> 03:34.600
he didn't use the CIA,
he didn't use the FBI,

03:34.600 --> 03:36.600
and he didn't use
the Department of Justice.

03:36.600 --> 03:38.367
He used GCHQ.

03:38.367 --> 03:39.400
- Wow.

03:39.400 --> 03:41.467
Now, that is going to piss off

03:41.467 --> 03:43.967
the British, and you do not want
to piss off the British,

03:43.967 --> 03:46.233
because if you do,
we will say, "Oh, dear,"

03:46.233 --> 03:48.367
shake our heads,
swallow the anger,

03:48.367 --> 03:51.533
and carry it around
until we die.

03:51.533 --> 03:54.800
Because think about what
he's actually alleging there.

03:54.800 --> 03:56.834
He is suggesting
a U.S. president

03:56.834 --> 03:58.667
enlisted a foreign
intelligence service

03:58.667 --> 04:00.567
to spy on
a political adversary.

04:00.567 --> 04:02.266
That is an explosive charge.

04:02.266 --> 04:04.934
Perhaps that is why
the NSA's deputy director

04:04.934 --> 04:08.100
told the BBC it was,
"Arrant nonsense,"

04:08.100 --> 04:10.266
revealing, "A complete lack
of understanding

04:10.266 --> 04:12.100
in how the relationship works,"

04:12.100 --> 04:14.667
and, for their part,
GCHQ called the accusations,

04:14.667 --> 04:16.533
"Utterly ridiculous."

04:16.533 --> 04:19.033
And yet, rather than distancing
himself from Spicer,

04:19.033 --> 04:21.467
Trump decided to back him up.

04:21.467 --> 04:24.800
- All we did
was quote a certain,

04:24.800 --> 04:27.800
uh, very talented
legal mind

04:27.800 --> 04:29.967
who was the one responsible

04:29.967 --> 04:31.467
for saying that
on television.

04:31.467 --> 04:35.867
That was a statement made by
a very talented lawyer on Fox.

04:35.867 --> 04:37.433
And so you shouldn't be
talking to me;

04:37.433 --> 04:38.934
you should be talking to Fox.

04:38.934 --> 04:41.767
- No, we should be
talking to you  about it

04:41.767 --> 04:43.767
'cause you're
the fucking president,

04:43.767 --> 04:45.100
and you're repeating it.

04:45.100 --> 04:46.266
[cheers and applause]

04:46.266 --> 04:47.433
"He only said it

04:47.433 --> 04:49.433
because he heard it
on television,"

04:49.433 --> 04:51.100
is barely an acceptable excuse

04:51.100 --> 04:53.600
for why your parrot said
a racial slur.

04:53.600 --> 04:55.633
"No, no, no, no!
We've been watching 'The Wire'!

04:55.633 --> 04:57.867
We've been watching
'The Wire'!"

04:57.867 --> 04:59.300
Oh, and so you know,

04:59.300 --> 05:02.700
that "very talented legal mind"
that Trump's talking about

05:02.700 --> 05:04.700
is this guy,
Fox News contributor

05:04.700 --> 05:06.033
Judge Andrew Napolitano,

05:06.033 --> 05:07.300
a man whose persona

05:07.300 --> 05:10.000
is so overwhelmingly
non-authoritative

05:10.000 --> 05:12.166
I just assumed he was a judge

05:12.166 --> 05:15.033
in the "Judge Reinhold" sense
of the word.

05:15.033 --> 05:17.633
Spicer was quoting Napolitano
directly,

05:17.633 --> 05:19.233
and even by Fox's standards,

05:19.233 --> 05:22.166
the judge
is an unreliable source.

05:22.166 --> 05:24.700
He has a history of entertaining
dicey conspiracies.

05:24.700 --> 05:27.533
He once questioned whether
bin Laden was actually killed,

05:27.533 --> 05:30.333
and a few years ago,
he went on Alex Jones' show

05:30.333 --> 05:32.934
and said this, regarding
the World Trade Center:

05:47.100 --> 05:50.734
- What a very talented
legal mind!

05:50.734 --> 05:52.133
And it is, frankly, telling

05:52.133 --> 05:54.367
that even Fox News anchor
Bret Baier

05:54.367 --> 05:56.767
didn't stand behind the story.

05:56.767 --> 05:59.400
- We love the Judge.
We love him here at Fox.

05:59.400 --> 06:01.266
But the Fox News division

06:01.266 --> 06:04.900
was never able
to back up those claims.

06:04.900 --> 06:08.433
- That is like how you talk
about a racist grandparent.

06:08.433 --> 06:11.266
"We love Nana,
we love her very much,

06:11.266 --> 06:13.734
"but we cannot stand behind
the things she says,

06:13.734 --> 06:16.133
"nor would the rest of us use
those specific words.

06:16.133 --> 06:18.400
"Also she has been watching
'The Wire.'

06:18.400 --> 06:20.033
"She's been watching
'The Wire.'

06:20.033 --> 06:22.367
"If Stringer Bell can say it,
why can't she?

06:22.367 --> 06:24.367
That's her point."

06:24.367 --> 06:28.767
And you know, if Fox News
admits a story is bullshit,

06:28.767 --> 06:31.333
then it is bullshit.

06:31.333 --> 06:34.500
So all the Trump team had to do
was apologize and move on,

06:34.500 --> 06:37.700
and they were so close
to doing that.

06:37.700 --> 06:40.166
- A senior administration
official said earlier today

06:40.166 --> 06:43.367
Spicer and national security
adviser H.R. McMaster

06:43.367 --> 06:45.200
offered what amounted
to an apology

06:45.200 --> 06:46.667
to the British government.

06:46.667 --> 06:48.633
But Spicer later disputed that,

06:48.633 --> 06:51.100
saying the administration
had no regrets.

06:51.100 --> 06:54.433
- That is Sean Spicer
saying he has no regrets,

06:54.433 --> 06:55.700
which is amazing,

06:55.700 --> 06:58.166
because if anyone on this planet

06:58.166 --> 06:59.667
should have fucking regrets,

06:59.667 --> 07:01.934
it is you,
Madam Ghostbuster.

07:01.934 --> 07:04.066
You should regret everything,

07:04.066 --> 07:05.767
every life decision
that brought you

07:05.767 --> 07:08.667
into this regretful job
that you regretfully hold.

07:08.667 --> 07:11.767
At this point, you should really
be more regrets than man--

07:11.767 --> 07:14.467
a regretotaur, if you will,
half--

07:14.467 --> 07:17.166
half man,
half regretful beast,

07:17.166 --> 07:20.000
cursed to roam the planet
until one day

07:20.000 --> 07:21.900
you're finally released
from your prison

07:21.900 --> 07:23.867
by the inevitable firing
you'll receive

07:23.867 --> 07:27.066
in, oh, let's say,
two and a half weeks, shall we?

07:27.066 --> 07:29.600
And look, there is no evidence
for Trump's claims.

07:29.600 --> 07:31.100
There is no discernible
motivation

07:31.100 --> 07:33.000
for the British government
to be part of this.

07:33.000 --> 07:35.500
Just the word
of a mid-transition werewolf

07:35.500 --> 07:37.967
with questionable views
on 9/11.

07:37.967 --> 07:40.800
And yet none of that
seems to matter to Trump,

07:40.800 --> 07:42.100
and I could tell you why,

07:42.100 --> 07:45.533
but I think I'll let
Fareed Zakaria do it for me.

07:45.533 --> 07:47.700
- I think the president
is somewhat indifferent

07:47.700 --> 07:49.800
to things that are true
or false.

07:49.800 --> 07:52.066
He has spent his whole life
bullshitting.

07:52.066 --> 07:54.333
He has succeeded
by bullshitting.

07:54.333 --> 07:56.800
He's gotten the presidency
by bullshitting.

07:56.800 --> 07:58.967
It's very hard to tell somebody
at that point

07:58.967 --> 08:00.467
that bullshit doesn't work,

08:00.467 --> 08:02.900
because look at the results,
right?

08:02.900 --> 08:04.433
- Yeah.
[cheers and applause]

08:04.433 --> 08:07.367
Donald Trump
is a bullshit artist.

08:07.367 --> 08:10.133
And I know Trump
might want to refute that,

08:10.133 --> 08:12.467
but to be fair,
someone on TV did say it,

08:12.467 --> 08:16.633
and I am repeating it,
so therefore, it must be true.

08:16.633 --> 08:18.133
And now this.

they know how.

08:25.300 --> 08:27.100

And top o' the morning to you.

- St. Patrick's Day.
- Top o' the mornin' to ya.

08:35.100 --> 08:36.367
- Top o' the mornin' there.

- Top o' the mornin' to ya,

- Top o' the mornin'

08:39.433 --> 08:41.200
- Top o' the mornin' to ya!

08:41.200 --> 08:42.567
- Top o' the mornin'
to ya.

08:42.567 --> 08:44.633
- Top o' the mornin' to you,
lad and lasses.

08:44.633 --> 08:45.967
- Top o' the mornin' to ya.

08:45.967 --> 08:47.266
- Top o' the mornin' to ya,
laddies.

08:47.266 --> 08:48.500
- Officers determined

08:48.500 --> 08:50.100
the victim was shot
on Denver Avenue.

08:50.100 --> 08:52.633
Officers on the scene
say they located blood

08:52.633 --> 08:54.600
on the car and weapon.

08:54.600 --> 08:56.100
We will bring you
more information

08:56.100 --> 08:58.400
as it becomes available.

08:58.400 --> 09:00.400
- Well, top o' the mornin'
to ya.

09:00.400 --> 09:02.100
[cheerful Irish reel melody]

09:02.100 --> 09:03.266
[cheers and applause]

09:03.266 --> 09:04.767
- Moving on.

09:04.767 --> 09:06.633
For our main story tonight,

09:06.633 --> 09:09.900
we wanted to take a quick look
at the federal budget,

09:09.900 --> 09:11.834
the only beach read
less appropriate

09:11.834 --> 09:15.367
than Bill Cosby's "Little Bill:
One Dark and Scary Night."

09:15.367 --> 09:17.033
And this week, Donald Trump,

09:17.033 --> 09:18.967
a man who constantly promised

09:18.967 --> 09:20.633
that he would run America
like a business,

09:20.633 --> 09:22.300
gave us our clearest sense yet

09:22.300 --> 09:24.567
of how he plans to do that.

09:24.567 --> 09:26.800
- The president revealing
his new budget proposal

09:26.800 --> 09:28.433
just moments ago.

09:28.433 --> 09:30.166
- It is promising
the most dramatic change

09:30.166 --> 09:32.066
in the federal government
since World War II.

09:32.066 --> 09:33.900
- This is a budget blueprint

09:33.900 --> 09:35.567
from the president
of the United Sates,

09:35.567 --> 09:37.500
a document
that he puts out there.

09:37.500 --> 09:38.967
It is his wish list.

09:38.967 --> 09:43.033
It is the way that he would like
the government to be funded

09:43.033 --> 09:45.033
and--and what
his priorities are.

09:45.033 --> 09:47.734
- Yes, this budget
is simply a blueprint,

09:47.734 --> 09:50.033
what's known in Washington
as a "skinny budget,"

09:50.033 --> 09:51.400
which sounds like a line item

09:51.400 --> 09:52.667
that Trump might have included

09:52.667 --> 09:54.033
in one of his prenups.

09:54.033 --> 09:57.667
So try and think of it,
this budget,

09:57.667 --> 09:59.667
as a presidential mood board,

09:59.667 --> 10:01.533
the mood board
of a president whose mood

10:01.533 --> 10:04.266
can always be described as,
"Impatient, vain,

10:04.266 --> 10:06.033
and horny for malice."

10:06.033 --> 10:08.934
So what is in this thing?

10:08.934 --> 10:10.600
- The budget blueprint calls for

10:10.600 --> 10:12.500
a $54 billion increase

10:12.500 --> 10:13.667
in defense spending.

10:13.667 --> 10:15.000
Take a look at this graphic.

10:15.000 --> 10:16.233
On the left, you see,

10:16.233 --> 10:18.400
uh, departments
getting an increase.

10:18.400 --> 10:20.567
That would be Defense,
Homeland Security,

10:20.567 --> 10:21.767
Veterans Affairs.

10:21.767 --> 10:23.333
The agencies facing cuts:

10:23.333 --> 10:25.233
the Environmental
Protection Agency,

10:25.233 --> 10:27.633
the State Department,
the Agriculture Department,

10:27.633 --> 10:29.967
the Labor Department,
Health and Human Services,

10:29.967 --> 10:31.967
and the list goes on and on.

10:31.967 --> 10:33.533
- You know what?
It is sort of fitting

10:33.533 --> 10:36.066
that the list of budget cuts
scroll by

10:36.066 --> 10:39.400
like the end credits
for America.

10:39.400 --> 10:41.834
"Thanks for helping us out,
Agriculture Department!

10:41.834 --> 10:43.667
"Hope you find a gig
with the next country

10:43.667 --> 10:46.000
that rises from our ashes."

10:46.000 --> 10:47.967
And while this budget
is very unlikely to pass

10:47.967 --> 10:49.333
in its current form,

10:49.333 --> 10:52.200
it is worth taking just
a few minutes to look at it,

10:52.200 --> 10:54.033
partly because it gives us
a clear sense

10:54.033 --> 10:55.433
of our president's priorities

10:55.433 --> 10:57.900
but also 'cause it gives us
a chance to get to know

10:57.900 --> 11:00.800
yet another one of the Trump
administration's key characters,

11:00.800 --> 11:02.734
because we've met
most of them by now.

11:02.734 --> 11:03.967
There's Steve Bannon,

11:03.967 --> 11:06.000
a wealthy
former Goldman Sachs banker

11:06.000 --> 11:08.066
who somehow constantly
looks like he just woke up

11:08.066 --> 11:11.233
on a park bench after losing
custody of his children.

11:11.233 --> 11:12.700
There is, uh, Kellyanne Conway,

11:12.700 --> 11:14.533
the brave survivor
of a terrorist attack

11:14.533 --> 11:16.633
she completely made up.

11:16.633 --> 11:17.967
And there's Stephen Miller,

11:17.967 --> 11:20.800
the least popular boy
at vampire school.

11:20.800 --> 11:22.934
Well, for this budget,

11:22.934 --> 11:25.100
we got to know Mick Mulvaney,

11:25.100 --> 11:27.100
whose name,
when spoken in my accent,

11:27.100 --> 11:29.233
sounds like what you'd call
a random Irish person

11:29.233 --> 11:31.734
if you're trying to get him
to fight you.

11:31.734 --> 11:33.066
He is the director

11:33.066 --> 11:35.100
of the Office
of Management and Budget,

11:35.100 --> 11:37.266
and I'll let--I'll let him
give you just a glimpse

11:37.266 --> 11:39.367
into the
highly scientific process

11:39.367 --> 11:41.300
by which he put this budget
together.

11:41.300 --> 11:42.967
- We came at it--
actually wrote the budget

11:42.967 --> 11:45.467
by going through
the president's speeches,

11:45.467 --> 11:46.800
going through
the interviews he had given

11:46.800 --> 11:48.133
and talking to him directly

11:48.133 --> 11:49.800
and finding out
what his priorities were.

11:49.800 --> 11:51.633
We took those words,
those policies,

11:51.633 --> 11:53.166
and turned them into numbers.

11:53.166 --> 11:55.000
- Yeah, basically,

11:55.000 --> 11:56.834
Mulvaney treated
Trump's past statements

11:56.834 --> 11:58.533
the way Trump treats women:

11:58.533 --> 12:00.333
randomly singling out
a few of them

12:00.333 --> 12:02.567
and then reducing them down
to numbers.

12:02.567 --> 12:04.900
But--but that cannot
have been easy

12:04.900 --> 12:06.266
when you think about it,
because

12:06.266 --> 12:08.433
translating the noises
that come out of Trump's face

12:08.433 --> 12:11.734
into hard policy prescriptions
is almost impossible.

12:11.734 --> 12:14.500
Take this statement
on military spending.

12:14.500 --> 12:16.433
- You got to make the country
rich again

12:16.433 --> 12:18.600
and strong again
so that you can afford it

12:18.600 --> 12:21.533
and so you can afford military
and all of the other things.

12:21.533 --> 12:24.600
- I--I don't know
what that was.

12:24.600 --> 12:26.700
To be honest,
it sounds like the audiobook

12:26.700 --> 12:29.133
of "A Farewell to Arms"
broadcast by an iPhone

12:29.133 --> 12:31.567
submerged in hot coffee.

12:31.567 --> 12:33.600
But--but apparently
Mulvaney heard,

12:33.600 --> 12:36.433
"Increase defense spending
by $54 billion,"

12:36.433 --> 12:38.433
because that is what
he's proposing.

12:38.433 --> 12:40.600
And as for the budget's funding
for nuclear weapons,

12:40.600 --> 12:43.667
they presumably had their basis
in statements like this one.

12:43.667 --> 12:46.000
- Putin has built up
their military again

12:46.000 --> 12:47.300
and again and again.

12:47.300 --> 12:49.200
Their military
is much stronger.

12:49.200 --> 12:51.367
He's doing nuclear.
We're not doing anything.

12:51.367 --> 12:53.200
Our nuclear is old and tired,

12:53.200 --> 12:56.467
and his nuclear is tippy-top,
from what I hear.

12:56.467 --> 12:57.767
[audience laughter, murmuring]

12:57.767 --> 12:59.200
- Again,

12:59.200 --> 13:01.867
I don't know how you turn that
into policy.

13:01.867 --> 13:03.633
"Let's trickle-dickle
some money-bunnies

13:03.633 --> 13:05.133
"into our boom-boom budget.

13:05.133 --> 13:07.433
"We're aiming for tippy-top,
people, because remember,

13:07.433 --> 13:09.233
"we're talking about
the most lethal weapons

13:09.233 --> 13:10.800
"in the history of mankind,

13:10.800 --> 13:14.266
so, if we can,
tippy-tippy-top."

13:14.266 --> 13:16.433
Now, that apparently means

13:16.433 --> 13:18.266
a $1.4 billion increase

13:18.266 --> 13:20.567
for the National
Nuclear Security Administration

13:20.567 --> 13:22.900
while cutting the Department
of Energy's overall budget

13:22.900 --> 13:24.233
by $1.7 billion.

13:24.233 --> 13:26.166
But to be honest,
I can't be certain

13:26.166 --> 13:29.700
because I don't speak
fluent toddler psychopath.

13:29.700 --> 13:31.567
Now--now, these cuts

13:31.567 --> 13:33.400
have made headlines
for their severity,

13:33.400 --> 13:35.400
but no one can say
they're surprised

13:35.400 --> 13:38.000
by who is on the receiving end
of some of the worst of them.

13:38.000 --> 13:40.500
For instance,
his 31% cut to the EPA

13:40.500 --> 13:43.600
is really just making good
on some pretty clear words.

13:43.600 --> 13:46.400
- Environmental Protection?
What they do is a disgrace.

13:46.400 --> 13:48.066
Every week, they come out
with new regulations.

13:48.066 --> 13:49.300
They're making it impossible--

13:49.300 --> 13:50.600
- Who's gonna protect
the environment?

13:50.600 --> 13:52.367
- They--we'll be fine
with the environment.

13:52.367 --> 13:53.834
We can leave a little bit,

13:53.834 --> 13:55.400
but you can't destroy
businesses.

13:55.400 --> 13:59.000
- We can leave a little bit
of the environment,

13:59.000 --> 14:01.066
specifically, this fish,

14:01.066 --> 14:03.300
this bit of crabgrass in Utah,

14:03.300 --> 14:05.300
and one of these meerkats.

14:05.300 --> 14:10.200
So don't get too attached,
one on the right.

14:10.200 --> 14:13.667
And look, there is nothing wrong
with cuts in principle,

14:13.667 --> 14:16.000
but with budgets,
as with haircuts,

14:16.000 --> 14:18.700
it's where and how you cut
that matters.

14:18.700 --> 14:21.000
And, believe me,
I say that as a grown man

14:21.000 --> 14:24.633
who had bangs on national
television for seven years.

14:24.633 --> 14:26.233
Cool?

14:26.233 --> 14:27.567
Cool.

14:27.567 --> 14:29.767
And--and it is
important to note,

14:29.767 --> 14:31.367
non-defense
discretionary spending

14:31.367 --> 14:33.834
is already at its lowest level
relative to GDP

14:33.834 --> 14:35.667
in over 15 years,

14:35.667 --> 14:38.567
lower than any year
of Reagan's presidency.

14:38.567 --> 14:40.767
And that's what makes something
like Trump's proposed

14:40.767 --> 14:44.066
28% cut to the budget
for the State Department

14:44.066 --> 14:46.100
and USAID so frightening.

14:46.100 --> 14:48.467
Although Secretary of State
Rex Tillerson

14:48.467 --> 14:50.467
doesn't seem that worried
about it,

14:50.467 --> 14:51.967
and one of the reasons
he gave for that

14:51.967 --> 14:53.800
was a little surprising.

14:53.800 --> 14:57.700
- What the president is asking
the State Department to do

14:57.700 --> 15:00.367
is, I think, reflective
of a couple of expectations.

15:00.367 --> 15:03.867
One is that, as time goes by,

15:03.867 --> 15:06.800
there will be fewer
military conflicts

15:06.800 --> 15:08.967
that the U.S. will be
directly engaged in.

15:08.967 --> 15:11.033
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hold on there.

15:11.033 --> 15:12.967
You honestly think
we're gonna have fewer

15:12.967 --> 15:16.000
military conflicts
under President Trump?

15:16.000 --> 15:18.233
There is simply no way
that is true.

15:18.233 --> 15:20.133
He just needs one person
to tell him

15:20.133 --> 15:22.333
that World War I was called
"The Great War"

15:22.333 --> 15:24.300
and he's going to want
to have a better one

15:24.300 --> 15:26.667
out of sheer pettiness.

15:26.667 --> 15:29.233
And making big cuts to things
like the State Department,

15:29.233 --> 15:31.033
International Development,
and the EPA

15:31.033 --> 15:32.667
isn't just shortsighted;

15:32.667 --> 15:35.033
it doesn't even
make fiscal sense.

15:35.033 --> 15:36.734
The EPA
is currently responsible

15:36.734 --> 15:39.300
for 0.2% of federal spending,

15:39.300 --> 15:43.266
and the State Department
and USAID are 1.4%,

15:43.266 --> 15:46.567
so you don't cut those agencies
as a cost-saving measure.

15:46.567 --> 15:48.567
You do it as a "fuck you."

15:48.567 --> 15:50.133
It is the budgetary equivalent

15:50.133 --> 15:52.867
of inviting Mitt Romney
out to dinner at Jean-Georges

15:52.867 --> 15:55.734
before not offering him
a cabinet position.

15:55.734 --> 15:59.400
And I will say,
that was awesome, by the way.

15:59.400 --> 16:01.667
Trump is so consistently
monstrous,

16:01.667 --> 16:03.200
sometimes
out of sheer coincidence,

16:03.200 --> 16:05.533
he happens to do
something amazing.

16:05.533 --> 16:09.266
Trump is truly
the stopped clock of assholes.

16:09.266 --> 16:12.667
But--but his pettiness
extends even further

16:12.667 --> 16:14.467
when it comes
to some of the tiny items

16:14.467 --> 16:16.200
his budget
eliminates funding for,

16:16.200 --> 16:17.700
like the national endowments

16:17.700 --> 16:19.633
for the arts
and the humanities

16:19.633 --> 16:21.800
and the Corporation
for Public Broadcasting,

16:21.800 --> 16:25.133
which, last year,
made up less than 0.02%

16:25.133 --> 16:26.633
of federal spending.

16:26.633 --> 16:28.333
But according to Mulvaney,

16:28.333 --> 16:32.066
it is unfair to expect people
to even pay that much.

16:32.066 --> 16:33.233
- When you start
looking at the places

16:33.233 --> 16:34.667
that will reduce, uh,
spending,

16:34.667 --> 16:36.300
one of the questions
we asked was,

16:36.300 --> 16:38.467
can we really
continue to ask

16:38.467 --> 16:40.133
a coal miner in West Virginia

16:40.133 --> 16:42.233
or a single mom in Detroit
to pay for these programs?

16:42.233 --> 16:43.300
The answer was no.

16:43.300 --> 16:44.600
We can ask them
to pay for defense

16:44.600 --> 16:45.934
and we will,
but we can't ask them

16:45.934 --> 16:47.100
to continue to pay for

16:47.100 --> 16:48.834
the Corporation
for Public Broadcasting.

16:48.834 --> 16:51.667
- Okay, that argument
isn't just insulting.

16:51.667 --> 16:53.433
It's absolutely ridiculous.

16:53.433 --> 16:55.867
Because while, yes, the military
keeps single mothers safe,

16:55.867 --> 16:57.333
on a day-to-day basis,

16:57.333 --> 17:01.166
"Bob the Builder" is an
actual lifesaver for them.

17:01.166 --> 17:03.166
"Declan, honey,
Mommy's gonna lie down

17:03.166 --> 17:05.367
"for a little bit while
you watch yourself some 'Bob.'

17:05.367 --> 17:09.433
He's the only man
I trust anymore."

17:09.433 --> 17:12.500
And if, if your real concern

17:12.500 --> 17:13.934
is for
the hard-earned dollars

17:13.934 --> 17:15.967
of single mothers
and coal miners,

17:15.967 --> 17:18.000
let's break that down,
shall we?

17:18.000 --> 17:20.500
Because if your single mother
needs to work

17:20.500 --> 17:23.033
and her child
attends a school,

17:23.033 --> 17:25.967
she might need access to
something like WINGS for Kids,

17:25.967 --> 17:28.200
an after-school program
that serves 1,600 children

17:28.200 --> 17:29.533
in three states.

17:29.533 --> 17:31.200
And guess what...

17:31.200 --> 17:33.600
- Under President Trump's
new proposed federal budget,

17:33.600 --> 17:36.800
WINGS' primary source of
funding would be eliminated.

17:36.800 --> 17:39.166
Bridget Laird is the CEO.

17:39.166 --> 17:40.333
How does that make you feel?

17:40.333 --> 17:41.567
- Makes me feel devastated.

17:41.567 --> 17:42.700
- Jessica Williams

17:42.700 --> 17:44.333
has two daughters
in the program.

17:44.333 --> 17:46.233
What happens
if it goes away?

17:46.233 --> 17:51.333
- Um, I really don't know
how I could...

17:51.333 --> 17:54.166
I really don't know.
I would be lost.

17:54.166 --> 17:57.700
- Okay,
so that is a really bad cut,

17:57.700 --> 17:59.633
and again, I say that
as a man

17:59.633 --> 18:02.166
who no one stopped
from going into a Supercuts

18:02.166 --> 18:03.967
with a photo of Demi Moore
in "Ghost"

18:03.967 --> 18:07.467
and saying, "This, but worse."

18:07.467 --> 18:09.467
And as for Mick Mulvaney's

18:09.467 --> 18:11.367
hypothetical coal miners,

18:11.367 --> 18:13.533
let's take a look
at what Trump's budget cuts

18:13.533 --> 18:15.567
from the Appalachian region.

18:15.567 --> 18:18.066
- One of those programs
at risk of losing all funding

18:18.066 --> 18:20.200
is the Appalachian
Regional Commission,

18:20.200 --> 18:23.166
which funded 35 different
projects and programs

18:23.166 --> 18:25.200
in Tennessee alone last year.

18:25.200 --> 18:27.767
- 35 programs
in just Tennessee.

18:27.767 --> 18:29.233
And that list includes
things like

18:29.233 --> 18:31.633
the Healthier Tennessee
Communities initiative,

18:31.633 --> 18:33.767
the Boys & Girls Clubs
of Tennessee Valley,

18:33.767 --> 18:36.367
and the Governor's
Books from Birth Foundation--

18:36.367 --> 18:39.467
all of which contain
so many positive words.

18:39.467 --> 18:41.533
I am presuming
that also in line for cuts

18:41.533 --> 18:44.200
are the Kid-Kitten
Hardhat Alliance

18:44.200 --> 18:46.667
and the Grandma's Wish Coalition
for Warm Cookies

18:46.667 --> 18:48.033
Straight from the Oven.

18:48.033 --> 18:49.767
The cookies will be
thrown away.

18:49.767 --> 18:52.367
The grandma will be put down.

18:52.367 --> 18:54.533
And by the way--by the way,

18:54.533 --> 18:58.433
those cuts are coming in a state
that went for Trump,

18:58.433 --> 19:01.400
which leads us to
the weirdest thing of all here.

19:01.400 --> 19:03.400
Some of the cuts
in Trump's budget

19:03.400 --> 19:06.567
heavily impact groups
that voted for him.

19:06.567 --> 19:08.500
- The one that strikes me
is rural airports.

19:08.500 --> 19:10.734
We spend money to help subsidize
rural airports

19:10.734 --> 19:12.667
where they otherwise
couldn't have air service.

19:12.667 --> 19:14.867
Now, maybe that doesn't make
any sense in an ideal world.

19:14.867 --> 19:16.433
Maybe on principle,
that's a bad thing,

19:16.433 --> 19:18.333
but the people who are
gonna lose their airports

19:18.333 --> 19:19.467
if we stop doing that

19:19.467 --> 19:21.133
are the people who voted
for Donald Trump.

19:21.133 --> 19:22.633
- So think about that.

19:22.633 --> 19:25.033
Trump's rise was fueled
by people in red states

19:25.033 --> 19:26.667
who were justifiably irritated

19:26.667 --> 19:29.967
that liberals sometimes refer
to them as "flyover country."

19:29.967 --> 19:32.800
But this budget could literally
turn some of them

19:32.800 --> 19:34.300
into flyover country

19:34.300 --> 19:37.567
because there would be
no other option.

19:37.567 --> 19:39.233
And even some Republicans

19:39.233 --> 19:40.767
are now wary of this budget.

19:40.767 --> 19:42.467
Hal Rogers, a Republican

19:42.467 --> 19:44.734
and former chair of the
House Appropriations Committee,

19:44.734 --> 19:46.734
went so far as to call
many of the cuts,

19:46.734 --> 19:49.734
"Draconian, careless,
and counterproductive."

19:49.734 --> 19:53.066
And a Republican saying that
about budget cuts

19:53.066 --> 19:54.800
is like a toddler
telling you,

19:54.800 --> 19:57.467
"This balloon fucking sucks."

19:57.467 --> 19:58.633
Really?

19:58.633 --> 20:02.000
I really thought
you liked those!

20:02.000 --> 20:03.800
And, look,
Trump's defenders will say

20:03.800 --> 20:05.934
that this is just him
being a businessman.

20:05.934 --> 20:08.367
It's a first offer,
it's a negotiation,

20:08.367 --> 20:10.333
the sort of thing
that you could learn all about

20:10.333 --> 20:12.100
in his book,
"The Art of the...

20:12.100 --> 20:14.100
"Wait, I Seem to be Betraying
Everyone Who Supported Me.

20:14.100 --> 20:15.433
"Ah, Well, Forget It.

20:15.433 --> 20:17.133
"Anyway, Let's Talk About
All the Trim I Got

20:17.133 --> 20:21.000
in the '80s, Right Fellas?
Hunga Munga!"

20:21.000 --> 20:23.500
But if anything
resembling this budget passes,

20:23.500 --> 20:24.900
many of Trump's own voters

20:24.900 --> 20:26.667
will likely wind up
getting burned,

20:26.667 --> 20:28.633
and they are going to be angry,

20:28.633 --> 20:30.633
and Trump himself
should know that,

20:30.633 --> 20:32.800
given that
in "The Art of the Deal,"

20:32.800 --> 20:34.233
he said this:

20:48.834 --> 20:52.300
- Oh, I think
people are catching on.

20:52.300 --> 20:55.066
It's taking longer
than is perhaps ideal,

20:55.066 --> 20:56.467
but I think, pretty soon,

20:56.467 --> 20:58.300
all of us will be fed up

20:58.300 --> 21:01.767
right up
to the tippy-fucking-top.

21:01.767 --> 21:03.533
And now this.

21:03.533 --> 21:05.033
announcer: And now,

21:05.033 --> 21:07.033
a special
St. Patrick's Day moment

21:07.033 --> 21:09.066
from "Fox & Friends."

21:09.066 --> 21:10.400
- Today is St. Patrick's Day,

21:10.400 --> 21:12.033
so we'll be celebrating
throughout.

21:12.033 --> 21:14.266
But it doesn't mean--
what did you just do?

21:14.266 --> 21:15.600
- I just moved
the leprechaun.

21:15.600 --> 21:17.100
I didn't realize there was
a leprechaun behind me.

21:17.100 --> 21:19.166
- Sitting between us.
- Remember a couple of years ago

21:19.166 --> 21:20.967
when we actually had
a leprechaun on the show?

21:20.967 --> 21:23.233
Where Judge Napolitano
sat on his lap?

21:23.233 --> 21:25.600
- Right, I don't think
that video's available anymore.

21:25.600 --> 21:28.367
announcer: Oh, you wish
that video wasn't available.

21:28.367 --> 21:30.266
- Let's go over
to Judge Andrew Napolitano

21:30.266 --> 21:32.333
with a special--
- Hey, I got my new buddy here

21:32.333 --> 21:33.800
from the University
of Notre Dame...

21:33.800 --> 21:34.800
- How are you, Judge?

21:34.800 --> 21:36.133
- Paddy, all right.
Good to see you.

21:36.133 --> 21:37.834
announcer:
Oh, what a fun memory.

21:37.834 --> 21:40.367
- We hired this leprechaun
off of craigslist.

21:40.367 --> 21:41.800
[laughter]

21:41.800 --> 21:43.767
- There's your first mistake.
- And you know what?

21:43.767 --> 21:45.066
You get exactly
what you pay for.

21:45.066 --> 21:46.166
announcer: Fuck you.

21:46.166 --> 21:47.667
[cheerful Irish reel melody]

21:47.667 --> 21:48.767
[applause]

21:48.767 --> 21:51.367
- And finally, this week,
before we go,

21:51.367 --> 21:54.133
I know the world
is a bleak place right now,

21:54.133 --> 21:56.533
so we wanted to leave you
with a happy story,

21:56.533 --> 21:58.300
and it involves Bolivia,

21:58.300 --> 21:59.934
a country you think about
so little,

21:59.934 --> 22:02.367
you don't even realize
that's not Bolivia;

22:02.367 --> 22:04.767
that's Colombia,
except it isn't.

22:04.767 --> 22:06.467
That's Venezuela.

22:06.467 --> 22:08.533
That is Colombia,
except it isn't.

22:08.533 --> 22:10.567
That's Bolivia, which is the one
we were looking for

22:10.567 --> 22:11.667
in the first place.

22:11.667 --> 22:13.000
Which one's Colombia?

22:13.000 --> 22:16.333
There is simply no way to know.

22:16.333 --> 22:19.834
The point is,
the Bolivian city of La Paz

22:19.834 --> 22:21.834
has had longstanding problems
with their roads,

22:21.834 --> 22:23.000
including traffic jams

22:23.000 --> 22:24.834
and a high rate
of fatal accidents.

22:24.834 --> 22:27.400
And I know that you're thinking,
"Wait. Hold on.

22:27.400 --> 22:28.934
"Your happy story

22:28.934 --> 22:31.533
involves fatal car accidents
in Bolivia?"

22:31.533 --> 22:32.734
Well, wait. Wait.

22:32.734 --> 22:34.734
Wait. Trust me.

22:34.734 --> 22:37.567
Because this is the solution
they came up with.

22:37.567 --> 22:38.967
[reporter speaking Spanish]

22:38.967 --> 22:40.900
- Appropriating the image
of the crosswalks,

22:40.900 --> 22:42.467
called "zebras,"

22:42.467 --> 22:45.467
and dressed in a costume
of the animal by the same name,

22:45.467 --> 22:47.867
these young people have been
going into the street

22:47.867 --> 22:51.300
of the city of La Paz
for the past 13 years

22:51.300 --> 22:53.900
with the goal of educating
the citizens with love

22:53.900 --> 22:55.667
and changing the chaotic face

22:55.667 --> 22:58.066
of the vehicular traffic
in this city.

22:58.066 --> 23:01.500
- Admit it.
You didn't see that coming.

23:01.500 --> 23:03.734
Not a single one of you

23:03.734 --> 23:06.033
was sitting there going,
"Traffic zebras!

23:06.033 --> 23:07.033
"I'm calling it!

23:07.033 --> 23:10.133
Traffic zebras! Yes!"

23:10.133 --> 23:13.300
Now, these zebras
don't have policing powers,

23:13.300 --> 23:15.767
like the ability to issue
tickets or make arrests.

23:15.767 --> 23:17.967
Instead,
they just tease people.

23:17.967 --> 23:19.100
And if you look online--

23:19.100 --> 23:21.600
and I cannot recommend
you do that enough--

23:21.600 --> 23:24.333
there is incredible footage
of them in action.

23:24.333 --> 23:27.000
You can see everything
from a zebra holding his head

23:27.000 --> 23:28.834
while a man jaywalks

23:28.834 --> 23:30.500
to one dancing
and spinning around

23:30.500 --> 23:32.133
in front of a speeding van
that stops

23:32.133 --> 23:33.967
just in the nick of time

23:33.967 --> 23:37.700
to this zebra risking his life
to stop a car

23:37.700 --> 23:40.133
to the many, many clips
of zebras dancing,

23:40.133 --> 23:43.467
every single one of which,
especially the last one,

23:43.467 --> 23:46.300
is absolutely superb.

23:46.300 --> 23:48.500
Watch him throw that down.

23:48.500 --> 23:50.700
And at this point,
you may be wondering,

23:50.700 --> 23:52.900
how did this happen?

23:52.900 --> 23:56.200
Well, it was based on
a similar program in Colombia,

23:56.200 --> 23:58.533
uh, where they dispatched
traffic mimes

23:58.533 --> 24:00.066
to monitor pedestrians.

24:00.066 --> 24:02.567
And as far as having mimes
rove around your city,

24:02.567 --> 24:05.734
I think we can all agree:
No.

24:05.734 --> 24:07.900
Not only is it
tremendously unpleasant,

24:07.900 --> 24:10.400
but being mocked by a mime
doesn't even work.

24:10.400 --> 24:13.266
All you have to say is,
"I can talk, and you can't."

24:13.266 --> 24:14.600
Argument won.

24:14.600 --> 24:17.467
You lock him in a glass box,
and you walk away.

24:17.467 --> 24:20.300
But Bolivia has really
taken it up a notch

24:20.300 --> 24:22.000
with this whole zebra business.

24:22.000 --> 24:24.767
The program started
with just 24 of them,

24:24.767 --> 24:28.700
and today in La Paz alone,
there are 265.

24:28.700 --> 24:30.633
That is a population boom
so great,

24:30.633 --> 24:32.734
it puts actual zebras
to shame.

24:32.734 --> 24:34.266
And that is saying something

24:34.266 --> 24:37.000
because zebras notoriously
have no shame.

24:37.000 --> 24:40.467
Put it away!
Put it away!

24:40.467 --> 24:42.667
That thing is a liability.

24:42.667 --> 24:44.200
Tuck it away.

24:46.233 --> 24:49.700
And while it may look like fun
for people,

24:49.700 --> 24:53.266
this is a real job
with strict rules.

24:53.266 --> 24:54.467
[reporter speaking Spanish]

24:54.467 --> 24:55.834
- They explained
some of the rules

24:55.834 --> 24:58.667
to be zebras, like:
honor the costume,

24:58.667 --> 25:00.333
don't eat when you work,

25:00.333 --> 25:03.200
never, never
take your head off.

25:03.200 --> 25:04.467
- That is a good rule.

25:04.467 --> 25:05.934
Never take your head off.

25:05.934 --> 25:08.600
You cannot risk shattering
an innocent child's belief

25:08.600 --> 25:11.667
that you are a real free-roaming
bipedal talking equid

25:11.667 --> 25:13.967
6,000 miles from Africa.

25:13.967 --> 25:16.734
And by the way, that applies
even in interview situations.

25:16.734 --> 25:18.567
There are many, many clips

25:18.567 --> 25:22.266
of reporters shoving
microphones in zebras' faces,

25:22.266 --> 25:26.533
even one with a zebra giving
an interview to another zebra.

25:26.533 --> 25:28.533
- This is very significant
for me.

25:28.533 --> 25:30.133
I really like what I'm doing,

25:30.133 --> 25:32.633
and it's not just about
telling people what to do.

25:32.633 --> 25:34.300
- Come on!

25:34.300 --> 25:37.300
Every interview is improved
by a zebra head.

25:37.300 --> 25:39.266
There's a lesson for everyone
there.

25:39.266 --> 25:41.367
Stressful interview
with "60 Minutes"?

25:41.367 --> 25:43.266
Put on a zebra head.

25:43.266 --> 25:45.033
Tough questions
on the red carpet?

25:45.033 --> 25:47.000
You put on a zebra head.

25:47.000 --> 25:48.066
Sean Spicer?

25:48.066 --> 25:50.066
Get yourself a zebra head,
man.

25:50.066 --> 25:51.567
What is wrong with you?

25:51.567 --> 25:52.600
[cheers and applause]

25:52.600 --> 25:54.867
And--and here's the thing.

25:54.867 --> 25:57.400
It doesn't just help
with Bolivia's traffic.

25:57.400 --> 25:58.934
Many of the people
in those costumes

25:58.934 --> 26:00.934
really need the work.

26:00.934 --> 26:02.767
- Many of the zebras
are young people

26:02.767 --> 26:05.867
who are recovering
drug addicts and alcoholics.

26:05.867 --> 26:08.533
It's a way for them to get
their lives back on track

26:08.533 --> 26:11.166
and to give something back
to society.

26:11.166 --> 26:15.000
- Look, they're not only
getting their lives on track.

26:15.000 --> 26:17.166
I'm pretty sure
the existence of these zebras

26:17.166 --> 26:21.066
is the only thing keeping
my life on track right now.

26:21.066 --> 26:23.900
And is it any wonder
how beloved these cebritas  are,

26:23.900 --> 26:26.867
considering the attitude
that they project?

26:26.867 --> 26:28.700
- Oh!
- Cebrita!

26:30.367 --> 26:33.300
- [speaking Spanish]

26:37.367 --> 26:40.834
- Yes, the zebra was inside her
the whole time,

26:40.834 --> 26:42.767
which, admittedly,
sounds like a description

26:42.767 --> 26:45.100
for a very risqué YouTube video,
but that's not the point.

26:45.100 --> 26:47.467
The point is,
I've got a few questions here.

26:47.467 --> 26:49.567
First: How the hell

26:49.567 --> 26:52.734
did no one
tell me about this before?

26:52.734 --> 26:55.133
I feel like we've been
pretty clear on this show

26:55.133 --> 26:57.066
about our interest
in South American countries

26:57.066 --> 26:59.066
you have scant
geographical knowledge of

26:59.066 --> 27:01.734
and people in animal costumes.

27:01.734 --> 27:04.066
And frankly,
I have needed this

27:04.066 --> 27:05.867
over the last few months.

27:05.867 --> 27:07.633
The news has been hard.

27:07.633 --> 27:09.967
Which brings me
to my second question.

27:09.967 --> 27:12.700
If zebras can make
Bolivian traffic jams bearable,

27:12.700 --> 27:14.700
what else could they help with?

27:14.700 --> 27:16.567
So here is what we've done.

27:16.567 --> 27:19.233
We made our own Bolivian zebra

27:19.233 --> 27:20.834
and have been seeing

27:20.834 --> 27:22.500
make painful moments
easier to take.

27:22.500 --> 27:23.834
And I'll show you how it works.

27:23.834 --> 27:25.567
Remember Trump's inauguration?

27:25.567 --> 27:27.734
Tough to watch, right?
But I'll say this.

27:27.734 --> 27:31.166
It's a lot easier to watch
with a zebra involved.

27:31.166 --> 27:34.200
- I, Donald John Trump,
do solemnly swear...

27:34.200 --> 27:38.133
- I, Donald John Trump,
do solemnly swear...

27:38.133 --> 27:40.667
- That I will faithfully
execute...

27:40.667 --> 27:43.166
- That I will faithfully
execute...

27:43.166 --> 27:46.200
- The office of President
of the United States.

27:46.200 --> 27:49.834
- The office of President
of the United States.

27:49.834 --> 27:52.533
- See?
It's better, right?

27:52.533 --> 27:54.867
Again,
it doesn't change anything,

27:54.867 --> 27:56.934
but it is easier to watch.

27:56.934 --> 27:59.133
Now, this works for
moments of frustration too.

27:59.133 --> 28:00.800
Remember how it felt
on Tuesday night

28:00.800 --> 28:02.400
when Rachel Maddow
made you sit through

28:02.400 --> 28:03.800
19 minutes of preamble

28:03.800 --> 28:06.233
to get to what amounted
to very nearly nothing?

28:06.233 --> 28:08.233
Well, you know
what could have helped then?

28:08.233 --> 28:10.633
A zebra to share your pain.

28:10.633 --> 28:11.767
- Somebody...

28:11.767 --> 28:13.767
[pages rustling]

28:13.767 --> 28:16.400
Has decided to leak...

28:16.400 --> 28:19.400
A portion
of his 2005 tax return,

28:19.400 --> 28:23.100
which is how and why
we got it tonight.

28:23.100 --> 28:26.100
And I am sure
it is only the start,

28:26.100 --> 28:27.467
but it's a start,

28:27.467 --> 28:30.000
and our little piece of it,

28:30.000 --> 28:31.834
we just got it.

28:31.834 --> 28:33.166
We'll go through it, next.

28:33.166 --> 28:35.066
- Come on!

28:35.066 --> 28:37.467
- I promise,
it works for anything.

28:37.467 --> 28:39.734
Take "Manchester by the Sea."

28:39.734 --> 28:41.333
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

28:41.333 --> 28:43.100
Pretty harrowing movie,
right?

28:43.100 --> 28:45.066
That couple went through hell.

28:45.066 --> 28:47.767
You know, if only
they weren't so alone.

28:50.300 --> 28:51.934

to talk to me.

28:51.934 --> 28:52.934
- [mutters]

28:52.934 --> 28:55.767
- No, let me finish.

28:55.767 --> 28:59.467
I love you.

28:59.467 --> 29:01.500
My heart was broken.

29:04.333 --> 29:06.367
It's always gonna be broken.

29:08.533 --> 29:10.967
And I know
yours is broken too.

29:13.166 --> 29:15.600
- Look, look, I think it's--

29:15.600 --> 29:16.600
[cheers and applause]

29:16.600 --> 29:18.633
I think it's pretty clear.

29:18.633 --> 29:21.133
With things in America
the way they are now,

29:21.133 --> 29:24.100
we need these zebras
like never before.

29:24.100 --> 29:26.266
And that is why
we've uploaded footage

29:26.266 --> 29:27.600
of a green screen zebra

29:27.600 --> 29:30.100
going through
a wide variety of emotions.

29:30.100 --> 29:31.867
You can use them
however you want.

29:31.867 --> 29:33.533
Just let us know
whatever you did

29:33.533 --> 29:35.800
with the hashtag
#JUSTADDZEBRAS.

29:35.800 --> 29:37.834
That is our show.
Thank you so much for watching.

29:37.834 --> 29:39.667
We'll be off next week,
back April 2nd.

29:39.667 --> 29:40.834
Good night.

29:40.834 --> 29:43.600
Please enjoy a dancing zebra!
