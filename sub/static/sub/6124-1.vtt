01:20.271 --> 01:21.125
Histories,

01:21.615 --> 01:23.531
like ancient ruins,

01:23.906 --> 01:26.406
are the fictions of empires.

01:30.094 --> 01:31.656
While everything forgotten

01:32.490 --> 01:35.427
hangs in dark dreams of the past,

01:37.563 --> 01:40.073
ever threatening to return.

02:09.323 --> 02:10.854
Lord'n heaven!

02:13.781 --> 02:17.427
Madame Wilde! Richard! Come quickly!

02:39.333 --> 02:40.875
I want to be a tailor.

02:41.979 --> 02:43.406
I want to be a farmer.

02:44.333 --> 02:46.052
I want to be a barrister.

02:46.083 --> 02:47.990
I want to be a truck-driver.

02:48.667 --> 02:51.177
I want to be... a pop-idol.

02:58.458 --> 03:00.635
Get him, get him!

03:00.667 --> 03:01.990
Leave him!

03:33.219 --> 03:33.990
Childhood,

03:34.219 --> 03:35.729
adults always say,

03:36.302 --> 03:38.052
is the happiest time in life.

03:40.760 --> 03:42.156
But as long as he could remember,

03:42.833 --> 03:44.500
Jack Fairy knew better.

03:50.260 --> 03:52.594
Until one mysterious day,

03:53.063 --> 03:54.385
when Jack would discover

03:54.781 --> 03:56.563
that somewhere there were others

03:57.073 --> 03:58.417
quite like him.

04:00.427 --> 04:02.979
Singled out for a great gift.

04:16.781 --> 04:18.135
And one day

04:19.938 --> 04:22.250
the whole stinking world

04:23.813 --> 04:25.240
would be theirs.

04:41.010 --> 04:43.385
Those who know

04:44.500 --> 04:47.052
They don't let it show

04:48.135 --> 04:50.750
They just give you one long life

04:50.750 --> 04:55.542
And you go, oh oh, oh oh

04:55.542 --> 04:57.917
Goes to show

04:59.104 --> 05:01.531
How winds blow

05:02.688 --> 05:04.313
The weather's fine

05:04.313 --> 05:09.875
And I feel so so so

05:09.875 --> 05:12.385
Birds of prey

05:13.427 --> 05:15.958
With too much to say

05:17.115 --> 05:20.625
Oh what could be my destiny

05:20.625 --> 05:24.281
Another rainy day

05:24.281 --> 05:26.833
Why ask why

05:27.240 --> 05:30.458
For by the by and by

05:31.677 --> 05:34.719
All mysteries are just more

05:34.719 --> 05:39.125
Needles in the camel's eye

06:16.844 --> 06:18.677
Look! It's Jack Fairy.

06:20.833 --> 06:22.208
Who's Jack Fairy?

06:22.396 --> 06:24.917
Those who know

06:26.031 --> 06:28.292
They don't let it show

06:29.479 --> 06:32.094
They just give you one long life

06:32.094 --> 06:36.667
And you go, oh oh, oh oh

06:36.667 --> 06:39.125
Why ask why

06:39.479 --> 06:42.885
For by the by and by

06:44.135 --> 06:47.156
All mysteries are just more

06:47.156 --> 06:51.354
Needles in the camel's eye

07:02.104 --> 07:03.813
The streets of London are ablaze

07:03.813 --> 07:06.500
in sparkle make-up and glittering frocks

07:06.500 --> 07:08.990
as the boys and girls

07:08.990 --> 07:09.813
of the current glam-rock craze

07:09.813 --> 07:11.938
pay tribute to their patron saint

07:11.938 --> 07:13.615
Pop-star Brian Slade

07:13.615 --> 07:15.417
and his space-age rock persona

07:15.417 --> 07:16.833
Maxwell Demon.

07:17.167 --> 07:18.167
Yeah, Brian Slade,

07:18.167 --> 07:18.896
he's just so different.

07:18.896 --> 07:20.917
I mean, I've never seen anyone quite like him.

07:20.917 --> 07:23.188
And 'Lipstick Traces', his last album was just...

07:23.188 --> 07:24.490
it was just something special.

07:24.500 --> 07:25.990
It's an album that's like,

07:25.990 --> 07:28.063
appealing to so many people like that.

07:28.063 --> 07:30.115
A palpable whirl of anticipation

07:30.115 --> 07:32.938
can be felt outside London's Lyceum Theatre

07:32.938 --> 07:33.896
as fans await

07:33.896 --> 07:36.948
the final show on Slade's smash world tour.

07:36.948 --> 07:38.500
Security around the performer is tightened

07:38.510 --> 07:41.094
following a recent BBC interview

07:41.104 --> 07:42.250
in which he admitted to

07:42.250 --> 07:45.198
premonitions of being assassinated on stage.

07:45.354 --> 07:46.021
Turn it off!

07:46.281 --> 07:47.635
...hasn't detain any of

07:47.635 --> 07:50.542
his enthusiastic and colorful followers,

07:50.552 --> 07:53.958
some of whom have been queuing here since late last night.

07:53.979 --> 07:55.323
Brian, the time!

08:02.688 --> 08:04.594
Ladies and Gentlemen!

08:05.146 --> 08:06.792
The Lyceum Theatre.

08:06.792 --> 08:09.365
In cooperation with "Bijou Music"

08:09.792 --> 08:11.490
is proud to present

08:12.000 --> 08:16.240
straight back from their fantastically successful European tour

08:17.104 --> 08:22.240
Maxwell Demon and The Venus in Furs!

10:43.667 --> 10:45.688
Put out the torches!

10:46.208 --> 10:47.510
Hide the moon!

10:47.854 --> 10:49.656
Hide the stars!

10:53.208 --> 10:55.313
For once, there was an unknown land

10:56.760 --> 10:58.427
full of strange flowers

10:58.438 --> 11:00.104
and subtle perfumes.

11:02.438 --> 11:06.198
A land of which it is joy of all the joys to dream.

11:08.115 --> 11:10.646
A land where all things are perfect.

11:11.490 --> 11:12.917
And poisonous.

11:13.354 --> 11:16.406
Well, you're the grand one

11:16.510 --> 11:18.740
Have you noticed

11:19.927 --> 11:25.417
When you walk in all the fairy boys are very nervous

11:25.854 --> 11:29.188
Well, my starship doesn't want me

11:29.188 --> 11:32.271
And neither does his world

11:32.656 --> 11:37.500
I'm glad I caught you on my view screen, sailor

11:37.500 --> 11:39.115
It appears today's youngsters

11:37.635 --> 11:40.063
You're the grand one

11:39.115 --> 11:40.635
have fashioned a whole new bent

11:40.635 --> 11:43.854
on the so-called sexual liberation of the flower-power set.

11:43.865 --> 11:48.896
'Cause this wooing is what I'm wanting

11:43.865 --> 11:45.219
The long hair and the love-beads

11:45.219 --> 11:47.917
have given way to glitter make-up, platform shoes

11:47.917 --> 11:50.125
and a whole new taste for glamour, nostalgia

11:49.875 --> 11:52.833
When my spacesuit comes to warm me

11:50.125 --> 11:52.594
and just plain outrageousness.

11:52.594 --> 11:54.104
Is London not shocked?

11:52.833 --> 11:55.896
And hold me like a god

11:54.135 --> 11:56.198
London is improving.

11:56.198 --> 11:57.781
Well, I think it's a disgrace.

11:56.542 --> 12:02.354
I am the captain of the gravity, Maxwell

11:57.781 --> 11:59.646
Parading around all ponced-up

11:59.646 --> 12:00.948
like a pack of bleeding woofters.

12:01.521 --> 12:03.396
Bloody hell! What will they think of next?

12:02.896 --> 12:05.479
Everywhere I see your faces

12:06.521 --> 12:09.094
Hot one

12:08.302 --> 12:10.438
And heading up this flash stampede

12:10.438 --> 12:13.396
is none other that pop-giant Brian Slade

12:10.729 --> 12:16.073
From a starship over Venus to the Sun

12:13.396 --> 12:15.604
whose stylish escapades have paved the way

12:15.604 --> 12:18.375
for a whole new breed of performing artists,

12:16.073 --> 12:17.844
But it's a crime

12:18.021 --> 12:19.563
You're mistaken

12:18.375 --> 12:21.188
from Curt Wild and The Flaming Creatures

12:20.000 --> 12:27.208
Momentary seizure of love, oh love

12:21.188 --> 12:23.688
to Jack Fairy and Polly Small.

12:23.688 --> 12:24.625
Thanks to Slade,

12:24.625 --> 12:27.396
today's youngsters are singing a whole new tune.

12:27.396 --> 12:29.135
So, you're saying you're bisexual?

12:29.135 --> 12:31.625
Yeah. I like boys, I like girls.

12:31.656 --> 12:34.188
They are all great. No difference, is there?

12:36.125 --> 12:37.354
Mr. BBC

12:37.354 --> 12:41.448
Rock music has always been a reaction to accepted standards.

12:41.469 --> 12:44.917
And homosexuality has been going on for centuries, yeah.

12:43.771 --> 12:46.125
But darling, I'm a mess

12:44.958 --> 12:48.615
At the moment, having a gay image is an 'in' thing.

12:46.135 --> 12:49.490
I've got human minds we can form

12:48.688 --> 12:50.667
You know, just like a few years ago

12:49.490 --> 12:52.271
But the boys are not impressed

12:50.677 --> 12:51.865
it was trendy to wear

12:52.292 --> 12:53.135
a long grey coat

12:52.583 --> 12:55.552
When my spacesuit comes to warm me

12:53.135 --> 12:55.302
with a Led Zeppelin record under your arm.

12:55.313 --> 12:56.354
Everyone is into this scene,

12:56.354 --> 12:58.969
because it is supposedly the thing to do right now.

12:59.469 --> 13:05.073
I'll be the captain of the gravity, Maxwell

12:59.573 --> 13:02.052
But you just can't fake being gay, you know.

13:02.052 --> 13:03.781
If you're gonna claim that you're gay,

13:03.781 --> 13:07.167
you're gonna have to make love in gay-style

13:05.094 --> 13:09.052
I see your faces in the strangest places

13:07.500 --> 13:09.844
most of these kids just aren't gonna make it.

13:09.052 --> 13:12.500
Hot one

13:10.594 --> 13:12.156
That line - 'Everyone's bisexual'

13:12.156 --> 13:14.010
it's a very popular thing to say right now.

13:14.010 --> 13:16.177
But personally I think it's meaningless.

13:18.677 --> 13:20.604
But it's a crime

13:20.646 --> 13:22.281
You're mistaken

13:22.563 --> 13:28.823
Momentary seizure of love

13:30.417 --> 13:31.573
Oh love

13:31.573 --> 13:32.990
I knew I should create a sensation,

13:32.990 --> 13:34.021
gasped the Rocket.

13:35.594 --> 13:36.833
And he went out.

13:41.281 --> 13:43.646
Ok, Lionel. That's it. Thanks.

13:43.646 --> 13:44.729
I don't get it.

13:44.729 --> 13:45.698
What don't you get?

13:45.698 --> 13:46.490
It was a stunt.

13:46.500 --> 13:48.354
The guy faked his own murder.

13:48.354 --> 13:49.698
Yeah, but why?

13:49.708 --> 13:50.688
Publicity.

13:50.938 --> 13:53.813
Arthur, any recollection?

13:55.542 --> 13:56.729
Of what?

13:56.729 --> 13:59.333
Of this Slade fellow.

14:01.573 --> 14:05.448
Well, he's an early 70s

14:05.448 --> 14:06.844
glam-rock singer.

14:06.844 --> 14:08.094
Told you we could count on

14:08.094 --> 14:09.625
Mr. Old Time Rock'n'Roll.

14:09.625 --> 14:10.917
Yeah.

14:11.344 --> 14:12.604
Count on me for what?

14:15.229 --> 14:17.510
I thought I was on the Reynolds' trip.

14:17.510 --> 14:18.229
Well you are.

14:18.229 --> 14:20.219
But the president isn't due until the 8th.

14:20.219 --> 14:23.198
And I need a piece for the weekend now.

14:24.990 --> 14:26.042
Great.

14:26.927 --> 14:27.823
Look.

14:28.490 --> 14:31.667
Next week is the 10th year anniversary

14:31.667 --> 14:33.573
of the whole shooting stunt incident.

14:34.000 --> 14:36.365
I'd like you to find out what happened,

14:36.365 --> 14:37.938
where he is today.

14:37.948 --> 14:39.854
What ever happened to Brian Slade?

14:39.906 --> 14:40.865
Ok?

14:40.865 --> 14:43.688
Yeah, and naturally you want me for this,

14:43.688 --> 14:47.229
because I'm the resident Brit. Right?

14:47.229 --> 14:48.917
Nah. No, no, no.

14:49.510 --> 14:52.406
I want you, because you remember.

14:58.865 --> 15:03.167
President Reynolds is urging young people everywhere

15:03.167 --> 15:06.750
to sign up in their local government offices

15:06.750 --> 15:08.917
and join the committee...

15:09.729 --> 15:11.302
Because I remember.

15:14.542 --> 15:16.698
Suddenly I was being paid to remember all the things

15:16.698 --> 15:19.260
that money, the future and the serious life

15:19.260 --> 15:21.073
had made so certain I'd forget.

15:22.469 --> 15:23.646
And for what?

15:24.188 --> 15:26.354
Some meaningless prank, a decade old.

15:27.948 --> 15:30.313
Why was is suddenly up to me to figure it out?

15:30.885 --> 15:32.135
Clearly there was something.

15:33.604 --> 15:35.198
Something from the past,

15:36.458 --> 15:37.875
spooking me back.

15:40.760 --> 15:42.229
I didn't realise at the time...

15:43.385 --> 15:44.333
It was you.

15:58.000 --> 16:00.552
Thank you "Trans-Electric" and "CRA"

16:00.844 --> 16:04.229
Micro Atlanta and "Dupree" for their generous support.

16:05.250 --> 16:08.844
Thanks to president Reynolds' Committee for Cultural Renewal

16:08.844 --> 16:11.010
for making this brodcast possible.

16:11.813 --> 16:13.177
And thanks to you,

16:13.729 --> 16:15.646
three billion viewers

16:15.646 --> 16:19.417
tuning in right now on global satellite.

16:29.823 --> 16:32.365
Yesterday upon the stair,

16:32.365 --> 16:35.813
I saw a man who wasn't there.

16:36.333 --> 16:38.896
He wasn't there again today.

16:38.896 --> 16:41.844
How I wish he'd go away.

16:47.448 --> 16:48.656
Ten years.

16:50.521 --> 16:53.052
Ten years and the world had changed so completely

16:53.052 --> 16:54.333
that the life I'd led in England

16:54.333 --> 16:56.188
seemed like someone else's life.

16:56.854 --> 16:58.302
Someone else's story.

16:59.344 --> 17:00.896
Anyone's but mine.

17:03.260 --> 17:06.573
There were times, when it appeared to Dorian Gray

17:06.573 --> 17:11.000
that the whole of history was merely a record of his own life.

17:12.426 --> 17:17.135
Not as he had lived it in act and circumstance

17:17.135 --> 17:20.375
but as his imagination had created it for him

17:20.375 --> 17:24.906
as it had been in his brain and in his passions.

17:25.948 --> 17:28.990
He felt that he had known them all.

17:29.458 --> 17:32.167
Those strange terrible figures

17:32.167 --> 17:35.438
that had passed along the stage of life

17:35.563 --> 17:37.646
and made sin so marvelous

17:37.646 --> 17:41.115
and evil so full of subtlety.

17:41.792 --> 17:44.896
It seemed that in some mysterious way

17:44.896 --> 17:48.760
their lives had been his own.

17:53.708 --> 17:55.698
I won't laugh at you

17:55.698 --> 17:57.667
When you boo hoo hoo

17:57.667 --> 18:01.594
Coz I luv you

18:01.594 --> 18:03.594
I can't turn my back

18:03.594 --> 18:05.521
On the things you like

18:05.521 --> 18:09.458
Coz I luv you

18:10.229 --> 18:15.313
I just like the things you do

18:18.104 --> 18:23.229
Don't you change the things you do

18:25.292 --> 18:27.135
You get me in a spot

18:27.146 --> 18:29.010
That's all the smile you got

18:29.010 --> 18:32.802
When I luv you

18:33.021 --> 18:34.792
You make me out of cloud

18:34.792 --> 18:36.646
And you put me down

18:36.646 --> 18:40.542
I still luv you

18:40.844 --> 18:42.875
Can you lend me a couple of quid? I've got money at home.

18:42.875 --> 18:44.000
You must be mental.

18:44.344 --> 18:45.635
Oh please, I swear I've got it.

18:45.688 --> 18:46.625
Piss off!

18:47.844 --> 18:49.010
Thanks!

18:51.188 --> 18:53.167
- What's it for? - Nothing.

18:54.052 --> 18:56.229
Give it here then. Let's have a look.

18:56.656 --> 18:57.792
Bloody Nora!

18:58.188 --> 19:00.490
Our kid's one of them pansy rockers.

19:01.292 --> 19:03.281
- He's a fucking puff, that one. - No, he's not.

19:03.281 --> 19:04.219
That's naff.

19:04.219 --> 19:05.510
That's naff.

19:05.833 --> 19:06.979
You're disgusting.

19:07.385 --> 19:08.490
You know that?

20:12.083 --> 20:15.188
Well, you're the grand one

20:15.365 --> 20:17.354
Have you noticed

20:18.698 --> 20:24.073
When you walk in all the fairy boys are very nervous

20:24.510 --> 20:27.896
Well, my starship doesn't want me

20:27.896 --> 20:31.115
And neither does his world

20:31.385 --> 20:36.313
I'm glad I caught you on my view screen, sailor

20:36.313 --> 20:39.104
You're the grand one

20:39.104 --> 20:41.042
Come and court me

20:42.125 --> 20:47.635
'Cause this wooing is what I'm wanting

20:48.438 --> 20:51.594
When my spacesuit comes to warm me

20:51.594 --> 20:53.677
And hold me like a god

20:53.740 --> 20:55.229
I'm just going out for a bit.

20:57.188 --> 21:01.354
I am the captain of the gravity, Maxwell

21:01.479 --> 21:04.656
Everywhere I see your faces

21:05.198 --> 21:08.594
Hot one

21:09.313 --> 21:14.688
From a starship over Venus to the Sun

21:14.688 --> 21:16.563
But it's a crime

21:16.677 --> 21:18.333
You're mistaken

21:18.708 --> 21:24.938
Momentary seizure of love

21:26.563 --> 21:28.323
Oh love

21:38.531 --> 21:41.625
Well, you're the grand one

21:41.917 --> 21:44.156
Have you noticed

21:51.677 --> 21:52.958
Today in London officials confirmed

21:52.969 --> 21:56.021
that the shooting on the 5th of February of singer Brian Slade

21:56.021 --> 21:57.802
at London's Lyceum Theatre

21:57.802 --> 21:59.135
was a publicity stunt

21:59.135 --> 22:02.052
mounted by the singer's company Bijou Music Limited.

22:02.052 --> 22:04.208
Manager Jerry Devine announced today

22:04.208 --> 22:07.115
that his company meant no harm in their escapades,

22:07.115 --> 22:10.073
that it was intended solely as entertainment.

22:10.240 --> 22:11.500
Very unfortunate,

22:11.500 --> 22:12.615
very sad and unfortunate that

22:12.625 --> 22:13.833
in this day and age

22:13.833 --> 22:18.375
an artist's quest for artistic freedom

22:18.375 --> 22:20.052
should cost him his career.

22:20.625 --> 22:21.865
Warum, denken Sie?

22:22.260 --> 22:23.635
Why do you think?

22:25.896 --> 22:27.125
I dunno.

22:28.813 --> 22:30.823
I dunno. It got too big, I guess.

22:30.823 --> 22:34.677
Too... got too schizoid, you know.

22:35.365 --> 22:36.104
I mean...

22:36.979 --> 22:39.406
he thought he fucking was Maxwell Demon in the end,

22:39.406 --> 22:40.073
you know?

22:40.844 --> 22:41.917
And Maxwell Demon,

22:41.917 --> 22:43.385
he thought he was God.

22:46.240 --> 22:51.135
But if it all works out nicely

22:51.677 --> 22:56.135
You'll get the bonus you deserve

22:56.323 --> 22:59.792
From doctors we trust

23:01.427 --> 23:05.979
The Fat Lady of Limbourg

23:06.427 --> 23:10.927
Looked at the samples that we sent

23:11.042 --> 23:14.698
And furrowed her brow

23:15.677 --> 23:16.698
Brian Slade?

23:16.698 --> 23:17.740
You would never believe that

23:17.750 --> 23:18.917
Oh yes.

23:20.417 --> 23:21.750
Quite well.

23:24.719 --> 23:26.979
Once upon a time.

23:33.625 --> 23:34.323
So...?

23:34.406 --> 23:35.469
Yeah?

23:38.167 --> 23:40.500
So, what was he...

23:40.500 --> 23:42.844
what was he... like?

23:43.917 --> 23:45.667
Who's that? Brian?

23:47.927 --> 23:49.073
Yeah.

23:56.333 --> 23:59.042
Like nothing I'd ever seen before.

24:05.104 --> 24:06.573
And in the end...

24:08.490 --> 24:11.198
like nothing he appeared.

24:16.760 --> 24:20.333
He was... elegance,

24:20.448 --> 24:23.833
walking arm in arm with lie.

24:28.375 --> 24:31.542
His real name, in fact, was Thomas.

24:31.542 --> 24:34.083
And his father owned a small tiling business

24:34.083 --> 24:36.063
in suburban Birmingham.

24:36.271 --> 24:39.615
But Brian never cared much for the suburbs.

24:39.615 --> 24:40.813
And as a young boy,

24:40.813 --> 24:42.948
he had the rare fortune

24:42.948 --> 24:44.365
of spending a summer in London

24:44.365 --> 24:45.740
with his aunt,

24:45.740 --> 24:48.417
a figure of some ill repute in the Slade family,

24:48.427 --> 24:51.063
after she married a cockney in the entertainment field

24:51.063 --> 24:53.271
and followed him off to Deptford.

24:53.271 --> 24:56.354
I never was a one to go and stint myself.

24:56.583 --> 25:00.021
If I like a thing, I like it, that's enough.

25:00.479 --> 25:02.250
But there's lots of people say,

25:02.260 --> 25:05.500
that if you like a thing a lot, it'll grow on you

25:05.500 --> 25:07.542
and all that sort of stuff

25:08.073 --> 25:11.625
Oh, I always hold in having it if you fancy it

25:11.823 --> 25:13.448
If you fancy it,

25:13.531 --> 25:15.094
that's understood.

25:15.542 --> 25:17.396
And suppose it makes you fat?

25:17.396 --> 25:19.344
I don't worry over that.

25:19.354 --> 25:23.177
'Cause a little of what you fancy does you good.

25:50.469 --> 25:52.229
Brian's tender introduction

25:52.229 --> 25:54.490
to the theatrical underworld,

25:55.417 --> 25:57.740
would leave a dramatic impression.

25:58.271 --> 26:00.708
Wop bop a loo bop a lop bam boom

26:00.708 --> 26:01.813
Tutti Frutti

26:01.813 --> 26:02.813
Oh Rutti

26:03.438 --> 26:04.427
Tutti Frutti

26:04.427 --> 26:05.563
Oh Rutti

26:05.563 --> 26:08.271
Tutti Frutti, oh goo lop bam

26:08.271 --> 26:09.406
Tutti Frutti

26:09.406 --> 26:10.563
Oh Rutti

26:10.573 --> 26:11.833
Tutti Frutti

26:11.833 --> 26:13.323
Tutti Frutti

26:13.448 --> 26:15.792
Wop bop a loo bop a lop bam boom

26:27.531 --> 26:29.938
So what are you? A mod or a rocker?

26:30.188 --> 26:32.542
Six of one, half a dozen of the other, really.

26:35.198 --> 26:37.740
Taking their cue from Little Richard,

26:37.740 --> 26:39.573
the swank London mods

26:39.573 --> 26:41.188
short for modernists

26:41.188 --> 26:44.510
were the first to wear mascara and lacquer their hair,

26:44.510 --> 26:47.323
the first true dandies of pop

26:47.813 --> 26:50.823
and known to just about any indiscretion,

26:50.823 --> 26:53.344
where a good suit was involved.

26:55.188 --> 26:56.698
Cry at night

26:56.698 --> 26:58.625
No one in sight

26:58.625 --> 27:02.729
An'we got so much to share

27:02.729 --> 27:04.406
Talking's fine

27:04.417 --> 27:06.260
If you got the time

27:07.219 --> 27:08.438
All right, lads?

27:10.250 --> 27:12.125
Do you wanna touch yeah

27:12.125 --> 27:14.000
Do you wanna touch yeah

27:14.000 --> 27:17.917
Do you wanna touch me there where

27:17.917 --> 27:19.802
Do you wanna touch yeah

27:19.802 --> 27:21.656
Do you wanna touch yeah

27:21.656 --> 27:27.500
Do you wanna touch me there where

27:35.594 --> 27:39.677
Style... always wins out in the end.

27:49.260 --> 27:50.479
Cheers!

27:50.479 --> 27:52.281
For Brian,

27:52.281 --> 27:54.260
the mods were a glamorous call to arms.

27:54.531 --> 27:57.615
Or at least to London, where three years later...

27:57.615 --> 27:59.625
at the Sombrero Club in Kensington,

27:59.990 --> 28:03.281
I would hear him sing for the very first time.

28:07.021 --> 28:09.740
Everything, it seemed, started at the Sombrero.

28:09.740 --> 28:13.260
No club in London had more notorious sway.

28:13.688 --> 28:14.990
And there, at the centre of it

28:14.990 --> 28:18.615
was Brian's American wife, Mandy...

28:18.625 --> 28:21.781
who's dramatic transformation to London party girl

28:21.781 --> 28:25.010
was a constant source of amusement to us all.

28:25.010 --> 28:27.208
You all know me. Subtlety is my middle name.

28:27.208 --> 28:28.583
It's as subtle as the piece of skin

28:28.583 --> 28:31.375
between my vagina and my anus? Oh La La!

28:32.333 --> 28:33.573
Now what's is that called,

28:33.573 --> 28:35.010
does anyone remember what that's called?

28:37.250 --> 28:41.833
No man's land! Oh gosh, my geesh, darling!

28:41.917 --> 28:44.448
Now, ladies of and gentlemen, boys and girls.

28:44.458 --> 28:46.948
And whomever else who may be in the house this evening.

28:46.948 --> 28:50.333
It is my supreme pleasure

28:50.521 --> 28:54.146
to introduce all you lovely little minxes here tonight

28:54.260 --> 28:57.656
to the Sombrero Club's prettiest star

28:57.792 --> 29:00.594
and my most shimmering hubby!

29:01.354 --> 29:05.417
I give you Brian Slade!

29:17.375 --> 29:22.781
Oh I was moved by your screen dream

29:23.927 --> 29:29.552
Celluloid pictures living

29:30.125 --> 29:35.854
Your death could not kill our love for you

29:40.281 --> 29:46.302
Take two people romantic

29:46.750 --> 29:52.229
Smoky nightclub situation

29:52.792 --> 29:57.990
Your cigarette traces a ladder

30:01.875 --> 30:04.667
Here's looking at you kid

30:05.385 --> 30:07.792
Celebrate years

30:08.396 --> 30:11.250
Here's looking at you kid

30:11.875 --> 30:14.521
Wipe away tears

30:15.385 --> 30:18.146
Long time

30:18.156 --> 30:21.323
Since we're together

30:21.531 --> 30:24.750
Now I hope it's forever

30:29.406 --> 30:31.573
Fuck. The mistress boner.

30:31.573 --> 30:33.219
Mmm, partly a lonely pervert.

30:33.219 --> 30:36.563
Tart. My dear. He's a tarting guilty clubber.

30:36.563 --> 30:40.094
#NAME?

30:40.281 --> 30:44.219
- But not that scruffy, as I last recall. - Ooh, you're wicked.

30:54.406 --> 30:56.083
He won't be back tonight.

31:05.615 --> 31:07.188
So, I introduced myself,

31:07.198 --> 31:09.948
told him I was developing my own management company

31:09.948 --> 31:12.031
and on the look-out for new talent.

31:13.563 --> 31:16.823
He introduced me to his wife, asked me what sign I was

31:16.823 --> 31:21.281
and before the week was out, we were signing contracts.

31:25.719 --> 31:29.188
You see, Brian believed in the future.

31:31.250 --> 31:34.438
He despised the hypocrisy of the "Peace and love" Generation

31:34.438 --> 31:35.875
and felt his music spoke

31:35.875 --> 31:39.490
far more to its orphans and its outcasts.

31:39.490 --> 31:42.458
His revolution, he used to say,

31:42.458 --> 31:43.823
will be a sexual one.

31:45.406 --> 31:48.083
But in 1970, rock audiences bred on

31:48.094 --> 31:50.500
Credence Clearwater and the Beatles

31:50.510 --> 31:51.667
were not entirely sure

31:51.667 --> 31:56.177
what to make of this particular brand of revolt.

32:00.000 --> 32:02.667
Radiate simply

32:02.667 --> 32:04.938
The candle is burning

32:04.938 --> 32:08.073
So low for me

32:10.760 --> 32:12.333
Generate me limply

32:13.021 --> 32:14.646
Somehow he got it into his head

32:14.646 --> 32:16.583
that he had to perform in a frock.

32:17.156 --> 32:18.063
Don't ask me why.

32:18.063 --> 32:19.396
I mean, I thought it was a bit naughty,

32:19.396 --> 32:21.021
a bit of a giggle, but...

32:22.729 --> 32:28.646
Somebody called me Sebastian

32:33.365 --> 32:36.740
Somebody called me Sebastian

32:36.740 --> 32:38.229
Who's this geezer, then?

32:38.229 --> 32:40.354
Some shirt-lifter from Birmingham.

32:43.052 --> 32:45.719
Work out a rhyme

32:45.719 --> 32:48.229
Toss me the time

32:48.333 --> 32:51.021
Lay me you're mine

32:51.021 --> 32:53.958
And we all know oh yeah

32:54.573 --> 32:57.854
Get the fuck off! Cut the shite!

32:58.531 --> 33:02.365
- Bugger off, you woofter! - Fuck off!

33:03.229 --> 33:06.000
Your Persian eyes sparkle

33:06.000 --> 33:08.177
Your lips ruby blue

33:08.177 --> 33:12.063
- Darling? Darling, you were fabulous! - Well done.

33:12.063 --> 33:15.948
Every bit! I was beaming, truly, like someone's mum.

33:15.948 --> 33:20.375
God. They adored you! Honestly. The whole lot - transported!

33:20.375 --> 33:23.500
Transported!? We went down like a fucking knackered lift!

33:23.510 --> 33:27.135
Brian, I tell you, I think it's simply a matter of presentation.

33:27.135 --> 33:29.177
#NAME?

33:29.323 --> 33:30.563
What happened to Judy Garland!?

33:30.563 --> 33:32.427
What happened to all your bloody torch song rubbish!?

33:32.427 --> 33:34.417
I know, I know, in a cabaret,

33:34.427 --> 33:35.708
but in the context of a rock show,

33:35.708 --> 33:37.458
I can see now, it's just a little bit more dodgy.

33:37.458 --> 33:39.042
But the act was there, wasn't it?

33:39.042 --> 33:40.896
The act was there. Just a...

33:42.354 --> 33:43.333
Brian!

33:43.510 --> 33:45.167
Lead singer and founder

33:45.167 --> 33:48.177
of the greatest garage band know to mankind

33:48.583 --> 33:51.281
Curt Wild!

33:58.125 --> 33:59.948
Curt Wild

34:21.177 --> 34:22.906
See that cat

34:24.603 --> 34:26.458
Yeah I do mean you

34:27.603 --> 34:29.728
See that cat

34:30.677 --> 34:33.000
Yeah I do mean you

34:34.302 --> 34:37.572
She got T.V. Eye on me

34:37.572 --> 34:40.688
She got T.V. Eye

34:40.853 --> 34:44.396
She got T.V. Eye on me

34:44.864 --> 34:46.208
Curt Wild,

34:46.208 --> 34:49.792
founder of the influential garage band The Rats,

34:49.864 --> 34:53.260
came from the aluminium trailer parks of Michigan

34:53.292 --> 34:57.740
where rock folklore claims far more primitive origins.

34:57.740 --> 34:59.427
She's out there

35:00.948 --> 35:04.146
She got T.V. Eye on me

35:04.146 --> 35:07.042
She got T.V. Eye

35:07.552 --> 35:11.052
She got T.V. Eye on me

35:14.188 --> 35:16.135
See that cat

35:17.594 --> 35:19.698
Yeah I love her so

35:20.865 --> 35:22.979
See that cat

35:23.979 --> 35:26.198
Well I love her so

35:27.406 --> 35:30.719
She got T.V. Eye on me

35:30.719 --> 35:33.635
She got T.V. Eye

35:34.135 --> 35:37.469
She got T.V. Eye on me

35:38.688 --> 35:41.625
According to legend, when Curt was 13,

35:41.625 --> 35:44.531
he was discovered by his mother in the family loo

35:44.531 --> 35:47.063
servicing his older brother,

35:47.958 --> 35:49.750
and promptly shipped off

35:49.750 --> 35:52.583
for 18 months of electric shock treatment.

36:31.417 --> 36:32.656
The doctors guaranteed

36:32.656 --> 36:36.646
the treatment would fry the fairy clean out of him.

36:39.854 --> 36:42.292
But all it did was make him bonkers

36:42.750 --> 36:45.531
every time he heard electric guitar.

37:33.760 --> 37:35.396
They despised him.

37:35.396 --> 37:36.438
Yeah.

37:43.021 --> 37:45.177
But when you're abused like that,

37:46.969 --> 37:49.448
you know you've touched the stars.

37:49.448 --> 37:50.896
I know. I just...

37:52.927 --> 37:54.594
I just wish it'd been me.

37:59.469 --> 38:01.010
Wish I'd thought of it.

38:08.135 --> 38:09.490
You will, luv.

38:11.240 --> 38:12.490
You will.

38:27.490 --> 38:30.875
Got tired of wastin' gas

38:30.875 --> 38:33.448
Living above the planets

38:34.490 --> 38:38.385
Mister show me the way to earth

38:40.760 --> 38:42.771
The boys of Quadrant 44

38:42.771 --> 38:44.594
With their vicious metal hounds

38:44.594 --> 38:47.635
Never come round here no more

38:48.490 --> 38:51.958
Sometimes I wonder if I'm still alive

38:55.354 --> 38:58.781
I'm six feet down at age 25

39:01.625 --> 39:04.865
Maxwell's led the demon rock hand jive

39:05.073 --> 39:08.781
I came down like water

39:08.781 --> 39:12.510
For the age of solar love

39:18.115 --> 39:21.781
And hail to the father

39:21.781 --> 39:25.479
Kiss your sons and your daughters

39:26.365 --> 39:28.365
Goodbye goodbye

39:31.365 --> 39:34.667
Steam scared and roller

39:34.667 --> 39:38.104
Ladytron controller

39:43.646 --> 39:47.875
Ten feet tall better walk it back down

39:50.229 --> 39:53.896
I came down like water

39:53.896 --> 39:57.740
For the age of solar love

40:03.406 --> 40:06.969
And hail to the father

40:06.969 --> 40:10.813
Kiss your sons and your daughters

40:11.406 --> 40:14.125
Goodbye goodbye

40:16.406 --> 40:20.031
I came down like water

40:20.031 --> 40:23.688
For the age of solar love

40:28.823 --> 40:33.333
Ten feet tall better walk it back down

40:55.938 --> 40:57.906
#NAME?

40:57.906 --> 41:00.375
Devine. Jerry Devine.

41:00.375 --> 41:02.063
Personal management. I'm interested.

41:02.063 --> 41:04.958
Oh, well, thank you, but I already have management.

41:05.667 --> 41:06.677
He's...

41:06.823 --> 41:08.177
Not in my opinion.

41:10.156 --> 41:13.865
The truth is you have talent. That's obvious.

41:14.604 --> 41:17.188
But it doesn't really matter much what a man does in his life.

41:17.958 --> 41:21.594
What matters is the legend that grows up around him.

41:22.198 --> 41:25.135
Today, you're a talented singer.

41:25.135 --> 41:26.115
That's all right.

41:29.708 --> 41:31.396
I can make you a star.

41:32.563 --> 41:34.563
And just how do you propose to do that?

41:36.427 --> 41:38.010
I will tell you, sir,

41:43.406 --> 41:45.177
when you pin me.

41:52.094 --> 41:54.563
I've never in all my life...

41:54.927 --> 41:56.740
May the best man win.

42:11.198 --> 42:13.688
We'll take the whole shebang

42:13.688 --> 42:16.510
All or nothing anything

42:16.510 --> 42:20.781
Ecstasy's the birthright of our gang

42:22.906 --> 42:25.469
We'll take the whole shebang

42:26.063 --> 42:26.938
Earlier tonight,

42:26.938 --> 42:29.385
on the popular chart show 'Top of the Pops',

42:29.385 --> 42:30.948
newcomer Brian Slade

42:30.948 --> 42:33.625
performed his hit single 'The Whole Shebang',

42:33.625 --> 42:37.135
dressed in platform boots and wearing glitter eye make-up.

42:37.135 --> 42:38.208
A spokesman for the show,

42:38.208 --> 42:40.698
known for showcasing pop's brightest stars,

42:40.698 --> 42:43.813
says they've been deluged with calls all evening.

42:43.813 --> 42:45.542
The next day every schoolgirl in London

42:45.542 --> 42:48.260
was wearing glitter eye make-up.

42:48.260 --> 42:50.875
And I was out of a bleeding job.

42:52.771 --> 42:57.604
And that, as they say, was that.

42:59.500 --> 43:02.146
I would not hear another word from Brian,

43:03.156 --> 43:06.792
or any of them for that matter, ever again.

43:08.469 --> 43:12.292
Have you got any idea what ultimately happened to him?

43:12.688 --> 43:15.042
I mean, where is he today?

43:15.375 --> 43:18.083
Last I heard he'd returned to Birmingham, but...

43:19.021 --> 43:21.802
this was three years ago? Four?

43:23.229 --> 43:26.802
No, I'm sorry, I'm afraid I can't help you there.

43:28.542 --> 43:32.740
- Looks as though it may be unavoidable. - What's that?

43:33.927 --> 43:36.427
The ex, I'm afraid.

43:38.083 --> 43:41.198
But then every story needs a contrary opinion,

43:41.198 --> 43:43.125
and with Mandy

43:43.646 --> 43:47.375
you're guaranteed excesses of both.

43:54.854 --> 43:56.063
Miss Slade?

43:59.365 --> 44:00.313
Yeah?

44:00.625 --> 44:04.438
I'm Arthur Stuart, from the Herald.

44:04.438 --> 44:05.708
We spoke on the phone.

44:13.344 --> 44:15.854
Anyway, I've just got a few questions I wanted to ask.

44:15.865 --> 44:16.948
It shouldn't take too long.

44:18.479 --> 44:19.865
Do you mind if I sit down?

44:20.333 --> 44:22.823
It's a free country. Sort of.

44:26.135 --> 44:27.542
So, what are you having?

44:28.948 --> 44:32.656
Scotch. Rocks.

44:34.615 --> 44:36.292
Yeah, make that two.

44:37.417 --> 44:40.833
Gee. You must be after some damn exclusive copy.

44:40.948 --> 44:44.365
Well, it's a piece on Brian Slade.

44:44.365 --> 44:45.406
You're not kidding.

44:46.802 --> 44:51.875
#NAME?

44:52.854 --> 44:57.156
Well it's been, ten years since the whole...

44:58.000 --> 44:59.292
fake shooting incident.

44:59.292 --> 45:01.635
Oh, and what a fake it was.

45:01.635 --> 45:05.063
Tricking us all in the end with such an authentic demise.

45:05.729 --> 45:07.167
His career, you mean?

45:09.385 --> 45:11.229
I mean, have you got any idea

45:12.385 --> 45:15.146
what happened to him or where he is today?

45:15.146 --> 45:19.656
Can't you just, run him through the files? Punch in the name?

45:19.656 --> 45:21.219
No, not exactly.

45:22.750 --> 45:25.010
Because, honestly darling,

45:25.563 --> 45:28.094
I haven't spoken with Mr Slade

45:30.729 --> 45:33.156
in seven years, at least.

45:33.938 --> 45:35.396
Seven years? Wow.

45:35.958 --> 45:40.896
Wow. Yeah. At least. Smoke?

45:41.135 --> 45:42.240
No thanks.

45:42.271 --> 45:47.479
No, right after everything crashed, we... we split.

45:48.417 --> 45:57.417
And Brian, he just became someone else.

46:01.781 --> 46:03.333
But again, he always was.

46:25.844 --> 46:27.427
That's 10 bob to you, mate.

46:40.844 --> 46:45.052
It was New Year's Eve 1969, the start of a new decade,

46:45.052 --> 46:48.875
and everywhere you went there was this sense of the future,

46:48.875 --> 46:51.917
the feeling in the air that anything was possible.

47:58.927 --> 48:03.125
See, Jack Fairy had also come to London

48:03.125 --> 48:04.010
in the swinging sixties.

48:07.125 --> 48:11.427
And in crowded clubs or hotel bars,

48:12.438 --> 48:15.594
this shipwreck of the streets

48:16.260 --> 48:19.354
rehearsed his future glory.

48:21.188 --> 48:25.292
A cigarette tracing a ladder to the stars.

48:52.313 --> 48:56.469
Maricon, bisexuelle, sexe douteux.

48:57.740 --> 48:59.750
Le Vice Anglais.

49:05.167 --> 49:06.417
I needn't mention

49:06.417 --> 49:08.792
how essential dreaming is

49:08.792 --> 49:11.438
to the character of the rock star.

49:14.354 --> 49:16.240
Jack, darling!

49:18.510 --> 49:21.406
Jack was truly the first of his kind.

49:21.563 --> 49:26.208
A true original. Everybody stole from Jack.

49:30.073 --> 49:33.688
But from the moment Brian Slade stepped into our lives,

49:36.875 --> 49:38.854
nothing would ever be the same.

49:44.208 --> 49:45.698
It was his nature.

49:56.260 --> 49:59.583
You got me girl on the run around run around

49:59.583 --> 50:02.302
You got me all around town

50:02.781 --> 50:05.688
You got me girl on the run around

50:06.115 --> 50:10.271
And it's getting me down getting me down

50:12.469 --> 50:14.521
Lady

50:14.521 --> 50:17.250
If you want to find a lover

50:17.615 --> 50:20.542
Then you look no further

50:20.667 --> 50:24.042
'Cause I'm gonna be your only

50:25.125 --> 50:27.302
Searching

50:27.302 --> 50:30.302
At the start of the season

50:30.302 --> 50:33.563
And my only reason

50:33.969 --> 50:36.885
Is that I'll get to you

50:39.458 --> 50:40.677
Do you jive?

51:03.594 --> 51:05.448
I'll find some

51:05.865 --> 51:08.823
Way of connection

51:08.823 --> 51:11.760
Hiding my intention

51:11.833 --> 51:15.469
Then I'll move up close to you

51:16.354 --> 51:18.719
I'll use you

51:18.729 --> 51:21.833
And I'll confuse you

51:22.354 --> 51:24.823
And the I'll lose you

51:24.823 --> 51:28.073
But still you won't suspect me

51:29.042 --> 51:31.781
So... I married him.

52:53.823 --> 52:56.979
I was dancing when I was twelve

53:00.292 --> 53:03.906
I was dancing when I was twelve

53:04.948 --> 53:06.104
Times,

53:08.563 --> 53:10.198
places, people...

53:16.000 --> 53:18.427
They're all speeding up.

53:21.844 --> 53:26.302
So to cope with this evolutionary paranoia,

53:30.260 --> 53:32.667
strange people are chosen,

53:36.042 --> 53:37.594
who, through their art,

53:40.438 --> 53:42.958
can move progress more quickly.

53:45.021 --> 53:46.823
It was the most stimulating

53:46.979 --> 53:51.333
and reflective period of our marriage.

53:56.635 --> 54:00.271
Is it strange to dance so late

54:02.958 --> 54:06.563
Is it strange to dance so late

54:08.385 --> 54:11.573
We are the boys and we are a class act

54:12.781 --> 54:13.781
Thank you and welcome,

54:13.792 --> 54:16.802
pop pickers, to 'Pick of the Pops'.

54:16.802 --> 54:17.740
I'm Davy Rocket

54:17.740 --> 54:20.188
and we have a very special show for you today,

54:20.198 --> 54:23.896
dedicated to one of pop's blazing new talents,

54:23.896 --> 54:26.198
and one who's been holding a virtual reign over

54:26.198 --> 54:28.292
the British charts

54:28.292 --> 54:31.229
for a startling record breaking 18-month span.

54:31.771 --> 54:32.677
Ladies and gentlemen,

54:32.677 --> 54:35.250
I give you the incomparable Brian Slade.

54:35.250 --> 54:38.688
Or should I say... Maxwell Demon.

54:39.469 --> 54:41.281
We are the boys

54:41.906 --> 54:43.208
The bloke at the front.

54:43.208 --> 54:45.792
Brian, why the make-up?

54:45.854 --> 54:49.156
Why? Because rock and roll's a prostitute!

54:49.156 --> 54:51.354
It should be tarted up! Performed!

54:51.740 --> 54:53.875
The music is the mask, while I,

54:53.885 --> 54:58.188
in my chiffon and taff, well, varda the message.

54:58.906 --> 55:00.156
Brian, Brian!

55:03.073 --> 55:04.198
Bloke in the suit there.

55:04.198 --> 55:05.135
What about your fans?

55:05.135 --> 55:07.458
Aren't they likely to get the... the wrong impression?

55:07.458 --> 55:09.063
And which wrong impression is that?

55:09.063 --> 55:12.042
Well, you're a blinking fruit!

55:13.229 --> 55:13.927
Well thank you, sir,

55:13.927 --> 55:17.219
and no, it doesn't concern me in the least.

55:17.646 --> 55:18.219
I should think that

55:18.229 --> 55:20.510
if people were to get that impression of me

55:20.583 --> 55:22.896
the one to which you so eloquently refer,

55:23.875 --> 55:25.563
it wouldn't be a wrong impression in the slightest.

55:25.563 --> 55:29.521
That is me, that's me, dad, that's me!

55:29.521 --> 55:32.802
I mean, everybody knows most people are bisexual.

55:32.802 --> 55:34.396
Any more questions?

55:34.948 --> 55:37.010
Yeah, woman with the beret.

55:37.010 --> 55:37.990
I was under the impression

55:38.000 --> 55:40.188
that you were married and living North London...

55:40.188 --> 55:43.167
I am married. Quite happily, in fact.

55:43.167 --> 55:45.594
I just happen to like boys as much as I like girls.

55:45.594 --> 55:47.375
And seeing as my wife feels pretty much the same

55:47.375 --> 55:48.802
about such things.

55:48.990 --> 55:49.510
I should think

55:49.510 --> 55:52.698
we've been able to make a fairly decent go of it so far.

55:55.208 --> 55:59.833
Alright, any more questions? Okay, thank you very much.

55:59.833 --> 56:01.594
For the first time in Brian's life,

56:01.604 --> 56:04.333
he was simply telling it like it was.

56:04.635 --> 56:07.229
Did he realize what he'd actually done?

56:07.521 --> 56:08.927
How could he have?

56:08.927 --> 56:11.729
I mean today, there'd be fighting in the streets.

56:12.750 --> 56:17.677
But in 1972, it was more like dancing.

56:40.229 --> 56:43.115
That man, sitting over there in the white suit

56:43.156 --> 56:45.781
is the biggest thing

56:45.781 --> 56:47.521
to come out of this country since sliced Beatles.

56:48.781 --> 56:53.031
Outside this country, no one knows who the hell he is.

56:54.635 --> 56:57.094
You people, you're gonna change all that.

56:58.240 --> 56:59.521
You guys, you're the actors.

56:59.521 --> 57:03.740
It's up to you to change Brian Slade, pop singer,

57:03.740 --> 57:05.948
into Maxwell Demon,

57:05.948 --> 57:07.563
space-age fucking superstar!

57:08.125 --> 57:11.448
Nothing fantastic about it. Why?

57:12.385 --> 57:14.990
Because the secret of becoming a star

57:15.448 --> 57:17.854
is knowing how to behave like one.

57:18.073 --> 57:22.688
- Hey kids, let's put on a show! - Precisely.

57:23.125 --> 57:24.083
Action!

57:46.073 --> 57:50.281
Cut! Cut! Cut! Cut! Sort him out!

57:57.167 --> 57:59.250
Bijou Music Associates. Good afternoon.

57:59.250 --> 58:00.542
#NAME?

58:00.542 --> 58:02.500
Bijou. Hello.

58:02.500 --> 58:04.125
Yes. You're through the reception. What can I help you?

58:04.125 --> 58:06.135
Oh, darling, I'm the biggest thing to hit the rocket

58:06.135 --> 58:07.969
since the pilgrim.

58:07.969 --> 58:09.188
#NAME?

58:09.635 --> 58:13.500
I know it's unprecedented, I know it's unorthodox, but sir,

58:13.500 --> 58:15.927
if you want Brian Slade,

58:15.927 --> 58:17.146
those are the terms.

58:17.146 --> 58:19.635
You may take them or leave them.

58:19.771 --> 58:22.510
- Yes? -I'm Shannon Hazelbourne.

58:22.510 --> 58:24.365
#NAME?

58:24.365 --> 58:26.240
#NAME?

58:26.240 --> 58:29.375
Oh, the position. Fine. Brilliant. Follow me!

58:29.750 --> 58:31.573
Hurray! Zounds!

58:31.573 --> 58:33.510
Now, Shannon,

58:33.510 --> 58:36.833
I realize of course your talents lie within the clerical art

58:36.833 --> 58:38.208
but I was wondering by chance

58:38.208 --> 58:42.448
if you had any experience with wardrobe?

58:43.167 --> 58:44.573
No, never.

58:44.573 --> 58:47.208
Fantastic. I think that's everything.

58:47.208 --> 58:49.260
No, I said I didn't.

58:49.260 --> 58:50.688
Everybody!

58:50.688 --> 58:52.875
I'd like to introduce you

58:52.885 --> 58:56.885
to our lovely new Wardrobe Mistress.

58:57.365 --> 58:59.240
What's your name?

58:59.500 --> 59:03.854
- Shannon. - Shannon. Welcome Shannon!

59:04.240 --> 59:07.771
Excellent! Yes, Mr Weinberg!

59:09.292 --> 59:13.573
Thank you very much indeed, sir. Cheers!

59:15.500 --> 59:20.125
- Extraordinary! - What Jerry? What?

59:20.125 --> 59:22.156
So tell me, Master Demon,

59:23.292 --> 59:28.542
who would you most fancy meeting in America?

59:28.563 --> 59:32.990
Ah, bravo! Jerry! Garbo, Brian, please!

59:32.990 --> 59:35.573
#NAME?

59:35.573 --> 59:38.500
- Very sorry chickee. He's dead. - Jerry said anyone.

59:38.510 --> 59:40.313
Brian? Who?

59:43.219 --> 59:47.438
Curt Wild. I want to meet Curt Wild.

59:48.823 --> 59:51.615
And meet Curt Wild we did.

01:00:13.177 --> 01:00:16.115
Well we can't take it this week

01:00:16.375 --> 01:00:19.792
And her friends don't want another speech

01:00:19.792 --> 01:00:22.208
Hoping for a better day

01:00:22.208 --> 01:00:24.854
To hear what she's got to say

01:00:25.104 --> 01:00:26.208
All about that

01:00:26.208 --> 01:00:28.688
Personality crisis

01:00:28.688 --> 01:00:31.500
You got it while it was hot

01:00:32.125 --> 01:00:34.969
But now frustration

01:00:34.969 --> 01:00:37.000
And heartache is what you got

01:00:38.521 --> 01:00:42.438
That's why they talk about personality

01:00:51.510 --> 01:00:53.094
But now your tryin to be some

01:00:53.094 --> 01:00:54.708
No you got to do some

01:00:54.708 --> 01:00:56.052
Wanna be someone

01:00:56.063 --> 01:00:57.802
Who cow wow wows

01:00:57.802 --> 01:01:00.458
But you think about the times you did

01:01:00.469 --> 01:01:02.771
They took every ounce

01:01:04.167 --> 01:01:06.938
When it sure got to be a shame

01:01:06.948 --> 01:01:09.823
When you start to scream and shout

01:01:10.542 --> 01:01:12.323
#NAME?

01:01:12.802 --> 01:01:14.802
I'm Rodney from Electra.

01:01:14.823 --> 01:01:16.146
I have Brian Slade here

01:01:16.146 --> 01:01:18.531
from England who just wanted to pop over, say hello.

01:01:18.531 --> 01:01:19.792
I just wanted to say

01:01:19.792 --> 01:01:22.000
I think your music is tops.

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:24.490
Really, smashing. Best of the lot.

01:01:25.313 --> 01:01:28.781
Smashing... top of...

01:01:29.729 --> 01:01:33.833
jolly... shit.

01:01:39.917 --> 01:01:41.302
Sorry, darling.

01:01:46.115 --> 01:01:46.417
Now at that time,

01:01:46.417 --> 01:01:49.146
Curt Wild was between management

01:01:49.146 --> 01:01:50.333
and Brian knew this,

01:01:50.333 --> 01:01:53.490
of course, and urged Devine to pursue the situation.

01:01:53.490 --> 01:01:57.823
And so if, in that probability, an interest arose

01:01:57.823 --> 01:02:01.188
in which Brian would serve on some projects,

01:02:01.188 --> 01:02:03.198
possibly, though not exclusively,

01:02:03.917 --> 01:02:07.063
as we're taking our lead from you here, Curt,

01:02:07.146 --> 01:02:10.615
possibly as producer on that project.

01:02:11.198 --> 01:02:14.875
How might that scenario, purely hypothetically...

01:02:15.021 --> 01:02:19.031
how might that scenario appeal to you at this juncture?

01:02:21.594 --> 01:02:22.823
What Jerry's trying to say is

01:02:22.823 --> 01:02:25.240
do you want to come to London to cut a record?

01:02:25.510 --> 01:02:27.031
Oh, yeah. Cool.

01:02:27.917 --> 01:02:29.771
Very good!

01:02:30.094 --> 01:02:32.094
But how can we help you?

01:02:32.365 --> 01:02:34.875
You must tell us. What do you need?

01:02:38.292 --> 01:02:39.417
Everything.

01:02:40.177 --> 01:02:43.271
See, heroin was my mainman.

01:02:43.792 --> 01:02:47.854
But now I'm on the methadone and I'm getting my act together.

01:02:48.958 --> 01:02:51.760
You come here and say you wanna help

01:02:52.125 --> 01:02:54.490
and I say, hey, far out.

01:02:57.396 --> 01:02:59.281
You could be my mainman.

01:03:01.438 --> 01:03:04.927
It was pretty clear what was happening. It happens every day.

01:03:05.438 --> 01:03:08.188
But for the world to think it was happening, well,

01:03:08.750 --> 01:03:11.542
that was Jerry's particular genius.

01:03:15.469 --> 01:03:16.896
Right away he started promoting the two of them

01:03:16.896 --> 01:03:21.115
like a pair of 40s starlets on the swoon.

01:03:22.115 --> 01:03:24.625
A Tracy and Hepburn for the 70s.

01:03:27.177 --> 01:03:30.135
Oh satellite of love

01:03:30.990 --> 01:03:33.896
Ah satellite of love

01:03:34.948 --> 01:03:37.542
Oo... satellite of love

01:03:37.542 --> 01:03:41.813
Satellite

01:03:43.729 --> 01:03:45.375
Satellites gone

01:03:45.604 --> 01:03:48.167
Way up to Mars

01:03:51.615 --> 01:03:53.740
Soon it will be filled

01:03:53.740 --> 01:03:56.823
With parking cars

01:03:59.469 --> 01:04:02.385
I watched it for a little while

01:04:02.594 --> 01:04:06.708
I love to watch things on TV

01:04:09.927 --> 01:04:13.292
Ooo... ahh... satellite of love

01:04:13.854 --> 01:04:16.927
Ha... satellite of love

01:04:17.771 --> 01:04:20.396
Satellite of love

01:04:20.396 --> 01:04:24.542
Satellite

01:04:26.250 --> 01:04:29.479
I've been told that you've been bold

01:04:29.479 --> 01:04:32.229
With Harry, Mark, and John

01:04:33.365 --> 01:04:37.146
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday

01:04:37.146 --> 01:04:40.677
With Harry, Mark, and John

01:04:42.531 --> 01:04:46.010
If I could have grown

01:04:46.740 --> 01:04:50.104
All upon my own

01:04:50.833 --> 01:04:54.656
If I could have grown I grew

01:04:55.021 --> 01:04:58.479
If I could have grew I do

01:05:00.406 --> 01:05:03.385
If I had a throne

01:05:03.385 --> 01:05:05.656
My career was on the skids, mate.

01:05:05.719 --> 01:05:08.000
And you fished me out of the muck.

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:10.146
You got me back on my feet, you did.

01:05:10.583 --> 01:05:12.260
It was nothing, chum.

01:05:12.260 --> 01:05:13.521
I wanted to help you

01:05:13.521 --> 01:05:16.292
make more of that far out sound.

01:05:16.292 --> 01:05:20.271
I love your music, my son, and I love...

01:05:25.604 --> 01:05:27.625
You don't have to say it, mate.

01:05:35.167 --> 01:05:38.885
At last the crimson chord cascade

01:05:38.885 --> 01:05:42.792
To shower dry cordials within

01:05:42.938 --> 01:05:47.000
Too late to leap the chocolate gate

01:05:47.885 --> 01:05:52.677
Pale fountains fizzing forth pink gin

01:05:54.625 --> 01:05:58.396
While destiny begins to fly

01:05:58.469 --> 01:06:02.406
The farmyard chorus sings it's wake

01:06:02.438 --> 01:06:06.417
Upstanding anthem to the sky

01:06:07.521 --> 01:06:12.688
Too soon to realise their fate

01:06:14.729 --> 01:06:17.760
Every great century that produces art is,

01:06:17.760 --> 01:06:20.469
so far, an artificial century.

01:06:21.073 --> 01:06:22.052
And the work that seems

01:06:22.052 --> 01:06:24.479
the most natural and simple of its time,

01:06:24.719 --> 01:06:28.896
is always the result of the most self-conscious effort.

01:06:29.021 --> 01:06:31.354
I am not really myself

01:06:32.083 --> 01:06:34.594
except in the midst of elegant crowds

01:06:35.438 --> 01:06:37.823
at the heart of rich districts

01:06:37.854 --> 01:06:42.156
or amid the sumptuous ornamentation of palace hotels,

01:06:42.427 --> 01:06:46.646
an army of servants and a plush carpet underfoot.

01:06:47.125 --> 01:06:50.333
What is true about music is true about life

01:06:50.365 --> 01:06:52.792
that beauty reveals everything

01:06:53.188 --> 01:06:55.417
because it expresses nothing.

01:06:55.510 --> 01:06:59.604
The first duty in life is to assume a post.

01:06:59.604 --> 01:07:02.219
What the second duty is

01:07:02.219 --> 01:07:04.833
no one has yet found out.

01:07:15.719 --> 01:07:18.542
The Aesthete Gives Characteristically

01:07:18.542 --> 01:07:19.844
Cynical Evidence

01:07:19.844 --> 01:07:24.385
Replete with Pointed Epigram and Startling Paradox

01:07:24.385 --> 01:07:28.490
while Explaining His Views on Morality in Art.

01:07:28.552 --> 01:07:31.375
Brian, Brian!

01:07:31.385 --> 01:07:33.750
Maxwell Demon is the story of a space creature,

01:07:33.750 --> 01:07:35.771
who becomes a rock and roll messiah

01:07:35.771 --> 01:07:38.625
only to be destroyed by his own success.

01:07:38.625 --> 01:07:40.656
Are you saying this is your destiny?

01:07:40.656 --> 01:07:43.438
Are you Maxwell Demon?

01:07:43.438 --> 01:07:45.979
Man is least himself, when he talks in his own person!

01:07:47.281 --> 01:07:49.896
Give him a mask and he'll tell you the truth!

01:07:50.333 --> 01:07:52.479
Brian! Brian!

01:07:52.781 --> 01:07:56.188
Is it your belief that all dandies are homosexual?

01:07:56.813 --> 01:08:00.667
Ha! Nothing makes one so vain as being told one is a sinner!

01:08:06.938 --> 01:08:09.813
Hey! Coming through! Coming through!

01:08:10.677 --> 01:08:14.010
Hey guys. Watch out! Excuse me!

01:08:14.417 --> 01:08:16.770
Coming through. Careful now! There you go.

01:08:16.770 --> 01:08:17.844
Tell us Brian!

01:08:17.844 --> 01:08:19.260
Are the rumours true that say you

01:08:19.260 --> 01:08:22.875
and Curt Wild have some sort of plans up your sleeve?

01:08:22.948 --> 01:08:27.656
Oh, yes! Quite soon we actually plan to take over the world.

01:08:38.865 --> 01:08:40.438
Excuse me, fellas,

01:08:41.490 --> 01:08:44.207
while I raise a glass to the loveliest man in Europe!

01:08:46.604 --> 01:08:49.000
And they tell you it's not natural!

01:09:05.500 --> 01:09:08.448
The world is changed because you are made of ivory and gold.

01:09:09.542 --> 01:09:12.051
The curves of your lips rewrite history.

01:09:38.917 --> 01:09:42.438
Baby's on fire

01:09:42.438 --> 01:09:46.740
Better throw her in the water

01:09:46.801 --> 01:09:50.375
Look at her laughing

01:09:50.375 --> 01:09:54.677
Like a heifer to the slaughter

01:09:54.708 --> 01:09:58.104
Baby's on fire

01:09:58.104 --> 01:10:02.156
And all the laughing boys are bitching

01:10:02.604 --> 01:10:06.167
Waiting for photos

01:10:06.167 --> 01:10:09.896
Oh the plot is so bewitching

01:10:10.500 --> 01:10:13.823
Rescuers row row

01:10:14.021 --> 01:10:17.469
Do your best to change the subject

01:10:18.396 --> 01:10:21.906
Blow the wind blow blow

01:10:21.906 --> 01:10:25.563
Lend some assistance to the object

01:10:26.167 --> 01:10:28.917
Photographers snip snap

01:10:29.760 --> 01:10:33.344
Take your time she's only burning

01:10:33.906 --> 01:10:37.625
This kind of experience

01:10:37.625 --> 01:10:41.281
Is necessary for her learning

01:10:41.677 --> 01:10:45.240
If you'll be my flotsam

01:10:45.240 --> 01:10:49.552
I could be half the man I used to

01:10:49.583 --> 01:10:52.906
They said you were hot stuff

01:10:53.135 --> 01:10:57.156
And that's what baby's been reduced to

01:12:31.583 --> 01:12:33.146
This is too much!

01:12:33.583 --> 01:12:36.344
Jim! What are you gonna do? Jim!

01:13:00.938 --> 01:13:03.688
Ah, my God.

01:13:36.990 --> 01:13:40.240
Could you conceivably turn down that blasted...

01:13:40.479 --> 01:13:43.802
Arthur! Arthur, open this door!

01:13:46.875 --> 01:13:48.854
You bring shame to this house.

01:13:50.521 --> 01:13:53.344
You bring shame to your mother and me.

01:13:54.375 --> 01:13:58.021
It's a shameful, filthy thing you're doing.

01:13:59.083 --> 01:14:00.802
Do you hear me?

01:14:02.229 --> 01:14:03.875
Stand up!

01:14:42.865 --> 01:14:43.729
It's funny how beautiful people look

01:14:43.729 --> 01:14:45.865
when they're walking out the door.

01:15:09.677 --> 01:15:12.917
Really Shannon, it's no problem, honestly.

01:15:13.333 --> 01:15:16.094
I'm not fussed about it, I'm quite open about it.

01:15:16.094 --> 01:15:18.313
I was having a fabulous time last night myself.

01:15:22.219 --> 01:15:23.906
Really luv.

01:15:26.469 --> 01:15:31.146
You shouldn't let it upset you so. Brian is a grown man

01:15:31.479 --> 01:15:34.573
and fully capable of shagging whatever he fancies

01:15:34.667 --> 01:15:37.208
and exceedingly partial to the practice.

01:15:39.229 --> 01:15:43.333
Now, just because someone sees, you know,

01:15:43.333 --> 01:15:44.594
two naked people asleep in bed together

01:15:44.594 --> 01:15:47.844
it doesn't necessarily prove sex was involved.

01:15:59.583 --> 01:16:03.729
It does, however, make for a very strong case.

01:16:03.927 --> 01:16:06.646
But you're a sweet, sensitive darling

01:16:06.646 --> 01:16:08.823
to be so broken up about it.

01:16:09.604 --> 01:16:10.646
Brian would be absolutely chuffed

01:16:10.646 --> 01:16:12.094
to know that you...

01:16:12.094 --> 01:16:14.656
Don't you ever dare tell Brian!

01:16:15.635 --> 01:16:18.135
Swear to me you'll never say a word. Ever.

01:16:24.594 --> 01:16:25.583
I swear.

01:16:31.260 --> 01:16:32.250
Jesus!

01:17:12.563 --> 01:17:17.646
Sudden change in plans. Brief holiday, much needed.

01:17:18.698 --> 01:17:20.427
Back by Hammersmith.

01:17:22.750 --> 01:17:23.583
B.

01:17:27.010 --> 01:17:28.083
That was it.

01:17:30.094 --> 01:17:34.594
And I knew my time

01:17:34.677 --> 01:17:37.844
with Brian, for a practical or perhaps is, was

01:17:39.688 --> 01:17:40.219
up.

01:17:43.271 --> 01:17:45.635
Look I'm sorry. I wish I could help you more.

01:17:45.635 --> 01:17:47.625
You seem like a nice guy. I just...

01:17:53.104 --> 01:17:55.729
don't think I have what you're looking for.

01:17:58.948 --> 01:18:00.875
See... I think you do actually.

01:18:02.990 --> 01:18:07.750
Oh yeah? And what makes you think so?

01:18:10.990 --> 01:18:13.052
Well that smile, for one thing.

01:18:14.708 --> 01:18:17.792
Well, smiles lie.

01:18:20.313 --> 01:18:21.354
Exactly.

01:18:27.490 --> 01:18:31.063
Listen. Once, of course,

01:18:31.073 --> 01:18:34.646
it was a gorgeous gorgeous time.

01:18:34.646 --> 01:18:38.875
We were all living our dreams.

01:18:42.865 --> 01:18:44.552
But you see all that went away.

01:18:47.365 --> 01:18:48.396
All of it.

01:18:51.375 --> 01:18:52.333
With Curt.

01:18:53.719 --> 01:18:56.688
And not even the real Curt.

01:18:56.688 --> 01:19:01.490
I mean, it was this idea of Curt more than anything.

01:19:01.490 --> 01:19:04.073
This image, which, of course,

01:19:04.073 --> 01:19:06.313
nobody could ever possibly live up to.

01:19:06.313 --> 01:19:09.333
I mean Maxwell Demon, Curt Wild.

01:19:09.333 --> 01:19:11.063
They were fictions!

01:19:13.458 --> 01:19:16.635
Somewhere along the way,

01:19:16.823 --> 01:19:19.813
Brian seemed to get lost in the lie.

01:19:20.396 --> 01:19:23.958
Won't you come with me

01:19:24.865 --> 01:19:28.990
To a place that's real

01:19:29.302 --> 01:19:33.167
Come and take my hand

01:19:33.646 --> 01:19:37.990
And will find a thrill

01:19:38.719 --> 01:19:41.875
Can't you see?

01:19:42.719 --> 01:19:46.740
I wanna tear it down

01:19:47.708 --> 01:19:51.115
Come with me

01:19:51.844 --> 01:19:58.219
I wanna kick it all around

01:19:58.219 --> 01:19:59.948
- Shit! - Cut it.

01:20:00.208 --> 01:20:00.938
Should I stop it?

01:20:00.938 --> 01:20:04.583
Tell me what you need

01:20:05.229 --> 01:20:09.125
I wanna be your unclean

01:20:09.948 --> 01:20:13.469
Give me anything

01:20:14.167 --> 01:20:18.302
I wanna be your dream

01:20:18.813 --> 01:20:20.688
He's gonna hit the bridge a half-verse early.

01:20:20.688 --> 01:20:22.281
Now you're simply wasting tape.

01:20:22.281 --> 01:20:22.969
Alright. Cut it.

01:20:22.969 --> 01:20:25.156
And I'll set...

01:20:28.531 --> 01:20:32.594
What? What? Is there a problem?

01:20:35.302 --> 01:20:37.396
#NAME?

01:20:37.479 --> 01:20:39.531
#NAME?

01:20:40.500 --> 01:20:44.063
Curt, we only ask that when you decide to make a change

01:20:44.063 --> 01:20:45.667
you simply inform us in advance,

01:20:45.667 --> 01:20:47.427
so Eton here is properly prepared, otherwise...

01:20:47.438 --> 01:20:49.354
What the fuck are you talking about man?

01:20:51.188 --> 01:20:53.198
I didn't make any fucking changes!

01:21:00.760 --> 01:21:01.688
Brian?

01:21:06.302 --> 01:21:10.479
Fucking mother fucker! Mother fucker, you're a mother fucker!

01:21:10.479 --> 01:21:14.740
Fuck you! Fuck you, mother fucker! Fuck you!!

01:21:15.125 --> 01:21:17.188
Eton! Eton, please!

01:21:20.302 --> 01:21:22.438
Brian, I'm sorry to be the one to have to tell you this,

01:21:22.510 --> 01:21:24.385
but what started off as an interesting experiment

01:21:24.396 --> 01:21:25.948
has quite frankly descended into

01:21:25.948 --> 01:21:28.292
a demeaning waste of your time and mine.

01:21:28.500 --> 01:21:30.792
I mean, you've already spent forty hours studio time...

01:21:30.792 --> 01:21:31.406
Thirty-six.

01:21:31.698 --> 01:21:32.417
Whatever!

01:21:32.417 --> 01:21:36.000
Thirty-six hours studio time on two, three bloody cuts!

01:21:36.906 --> 01:21:39.208
Brian, you seem to forget, you're a very big star now,

01:21:39.208 --> 01:21:41.531
and I think your time is worth a great deal more than this...

01:21:41.531 --> 01:21:44.063
Fucking space-queen on your fucking high horse!

01:21:44.063 --> 01:21:45.552
And all your fucking henchmen!

01:21:45.552 --> 01:21:49.000
Fuck you, fuck you!

01:21:52.719 --> 01:21:55.427
Perhaps it's time for another little break. Hey fellas?

01:21:58.490 --> 01:21:59.771
Give us a stretch.

01:22:11.323 --> 01:22:12.281
Jerry?

01:22:18.490 --> 01:22:20.792
I can't risk extending his contract, Brian.

01:22:22.125 --> 01:22:23.823
I think it's quite clear why.

01:22:25.448 --> 01:22:26.531
I'll talk to you tomorrow.

01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:49.479
Piss off! Go on then!

01:22:49.479 --> 01:22:51.417
Back to your wolves!

01:22:51.417 --> 01:22:54.010
Your junkie twerps!

01:22:54.010 --> 01:22:56.208
Your bloody shock treatment!

01:22:56.208 --> 01:22:57.427
And fuck you too!

01:23:02.563 --> 01:23:05.854
It all came crashing down.

01:23:08.646 --> 01:23:11.313
I just stood on the sideline and watched,

01:23:12.323 --> 01:23:14.958
just like everybody else.

01:23:36.896 --> 01:23:44.771
Well, this is such a sad affair

01:23:45.740 --> 01:23:58.531
I've opened up my heart so many times

01:24:01.531 --> 01:24:05.552
But now it's closed

01:24:09.563 --> 01:24:11.563
Out! O-U-T.

01:24:11.563 --> 01:24:15.094
Well, Brian. I'm afraid that is completely out of the question.

01:24:15.490 --> 01:24:17.583
You are contractually bound to

01:24:17.615 --> 01:24:19.021
finish the Maxwell Demon tour

01:24:19.021 --> 01:24:20.427
as Maxwell Demon.

01:24:20.427 --> 01:24:21.531
Jerry, I'm telling you,

01:24:21.531 --> 01:24:22.635
it's just getting far too out of hand...

01:24:23.073 --> 01:24:26.375
Brian! I realize you're under tremendous strain,

01:24:26.552 --> 01:24:27.948
but you've just gotta hang on in there

01:24:27.948 --> 01:24:29.813
and finish the bloody tour.

01:24:30.417 --> 01:24:32.948
You hang on in there. I'll hang on here. Right?

01:24:32.948 --> 01:24:35.479
And then you can do what you want. OK?

01:24:37.833 --> 01:24:42.625
Oh my dear

01:24:45.646 --> 01:24:51.052
Every salted tear it wrings

01:24:52.906 --> 01:24:58.042
Bitter-sweet applause

01:25:19.885 --> 01:25:23.698
But when the show's in full swing

01:25:26.396 --> 01:25:30.458
Every once in a while

01:25:33.979 --> 01:25:37.375
High stepping chorus lines

01:25:37.375 --> 01:25:39.969
Mean I'm forgetting

01:25:42.083 --> 01:25:47.323
Mein lullaby - liebchen

01:25:54.021 --> 01:25:57.510
Down with Slade!

01:26:10.094 --> 01:26:15.177
How rich in contrast

01:26:15.177 --> 01:26:17.531
Love can be

01:26:18.865 --> 01:26:25.594
Sometimes I'm quite amused

01:26:26.052 --> 01:26:30.417
To see it twist and turn

01:26:31.469 --> 01:26:37.771
To taste - both sweet and dry

01:26:41.208 --> 01:26:46.698
These vintage years

01:26:49.250 --> 01:26:54.917
Lovers you consume, my friend

01:26:55.750 --> 01:27:01.260
As others their wine

01:27:03.625 --> 01:27:07.802
Nein - das ist nicht

01:27:07.802 --> 01:27:10.719
Das ende der Welt

01:27:12.750 --> 01:27:17.208
Gestrandet an Leben und Kunst

01:27:17.490 --> 01:27:20.604
I don't believe that there is much of a future to speak of.

01:27:20.719 --> 01:27:23.438
We're in a bit of a decadent spiral, aren't we?

01:27:24.583 --> 01:27:26.104
Sinking fast.

01:27:26.615 --> 01:27:28.719
Big Brother, baby. All the way.

01:27:29.083 --> 01:27:31.771
Which is why we prefer impressions to ideas.

01:27:31.771 --> 01:27:33.271
Situations to subjects.

01:27:33.271 --> 01:27:36.313
Brief flights to sustained ones.

01:27:36.313 --> 01:27:40.656
#NAME?

01:27:44.625 --> 01:27:49.177
Well I'm... I'm just looking for a room at the moment.

01:27:56.021 --> 01:28:04.156
And now, as you turn to leave

01:28:04.656 --> 01:28:10.875
You try to force a smile

01:28:11.844 --> 01:28:16.031
As if to compensate

01:28:17.042 --> 01:28:29.031
Then you break down and cry

01:28:35.333 --> 01:28:35.958
So for one entire day,

01:28:35.958 --> 01:28:38.625
I actually think Brian's been shot.

01:28:42.292 --> 01:28:44.427
That the whole thing is real.

01:28:45.219 --> 01:28:49.260
All his paranoias proven horribly true.

01:28:49.260 --> 01:28:51.000
#NAME?

01:28:56.344 --> 01:28:57.177
Why?

01:28:58.781 --> 01:28:59.656
Forgot.

01:29:04.281 --> 01:29:05.198
Jesus!

01:29:05.573 --> 01:29:09.677
I mean... I knew it was over. I just...

01:29:12.771 --> 01:29:14.875
didn't know it was up to me to make it stop.

01:29:54.010 --> 01:29:57.083
#NAME?

01:30:03.177 --> 01:30:04.135
No, thanks.

01:30:14.406 --> 01:30:15.688
These are the papers.

01:30:17.271 --> 01:30:20.208
I believe they're in order.

01:30:21.260 --> 01:30:22.573
All you need to do is sign.

01:30:34.844 --> 01:30:36.323
So you won't forget.

01:30:37.917 --> 01:30:39.969
- I already have. - Evidently!

01:30:45.979 --> 01:30:49.563
Fuck you, Brian! Did you ever,

01:30:49.563 --> 01:30:51.323
for one bloody second in your life,

01:30:51.323 --> 01:30:53.833
want anything more... than this?

01:30:55.625 --> 01:30:56.458
No.

01:31:01.969 --> 01:31:03.313
Your problem is...

01:31:04.938 --> 01:31:09.292
you get what you want and do what you will.

01:31:09.875 --> 01:31:12.625
Worlds, Mandy, are built out of suffering.

01:31:12.917 --> 01:31:15.354
There is suffering at the birth of a child

01:31:15.354 --> 01:31:17.042
as at the birth of a star.

01:31:17.042 --> 01:31:20.396
You live in terror of not being misunderstood.

01:31:20.396 --> 01:31:22.740
Women defend themselves by attacking,

01:31:22.740 --> 01:31:23.875
just as they attack

01:31:23.875 --> 01:31:25.781
by sudden and strange surrenders.

01:31:28.260 --> 01:31:30.219
I lost my girlhood, true.

01:31:34.542 --> 01:31:35.865
But it was for you.

01:31:40.052 --> 01:31:42.552
What in God's name is going on up here?

01:31:42.781 --> 01:31:44.552
How the fuck did you get up here?

01:31:44.615 --> 01:31:45.896
Brian, I'm really sorry about...

01:31:45.896 --> 01:31:47.021
It's alright, Shannon.

01:31:47.781 --> 01:31:49.438
Mandy was just leaving.

01:31:52.802 --> 01:31:55.021
Mandy, if you'd be so kind as to follow me...

01:31:55.021 --> 01:31:59.115
Let go of me. I'm perfectly capable of making my own...

01:32:02.760 --> 01:32:04.917
I really don't want to have to call someone.

01:32:09.031 --> 01:32:11.167
Call someone?

01:32:14.479 --> 01:32:17.188
I am his wife, for fuck's sake!

01:32:21.979 --> 01:32:23.885
Fuck the lot of you!

01:32:31.531 --> 01:32:33.427
Was that the last time you saw him?

01:32:34.229 --> 01:32:35.063
No.

01:32:36.104 --> 01:32:40.125
That was the last time we actually... spoke.

01:32:45.406 --> 01:32:47.083
I saw him again.

01:32:47.083 --> 01:32:50.198
Briefly, a few weeks later, at a concert.

01:32:50.240 --> 01:32:51.438
He was performing?

01:32:53.615 --> 01:32:58.167
No. Curt was actually performing.

01:32:58.688 --> 01:33:00.417
He and Jack Fairy had just finished

01:33:00.417 --> 01:33:01.563
their Berlin record,

01:33:01.563 --> 01:33:03.167
and Curt was in London playing some gigs.

01:33:03.167 --> 01:33:05.958
And Brian was there, for a second.

01:33:05.958 --> 01:33:07.604
I don't think anyone even saw him.

01:33:11.719 --> 01:33:12.885
Which concert?

01:33:20.167 --> 01:33:21.594
It was like a tribute.

01:33:22.542 --> 01:33:25.938
Sort of a farewell concert to glam rock.

01:33:25.948 --> 01:33:29.042
To save your wild, wild lives.

01:33:29.063 --> 01:33:31.740
To ne'er your fans embitter.

01:33:31.979 --> 01:33:34.938
To cease your sad demise.

01:33:35.177 --> 01:33:37.563
Tonight, we toast!

01:33:57.104 --> 01:34:00.427
Friends say it's fine, friends say it's good

01:34:00.427 --> 01:34:04.979
Everybody says it's just like Robin Hood

01:34:10.708 --> 01:34:14.177
I move like a rat, talk like a cat

01:34:14.177 --> 01:34:16.083
Sting like a bee

01:34:16.083 --> 01:34:19.375
Baby I'm gonna be your man

01:34:24.396 --> 01:34:28.240
And it's great to see you're mad for me, yeah

01:34:28.240 --> 01:34:31.813
I'm your toy, your 20th century boy

01:34:39.615 --> 01:34:41.250
- Is this working? - You know it's working.

01:34:41.250 --> 01:34:42.906
No. Cos I want it blue-er.

01:34:46.198 --> 01:34:47.125
I don't think you should bother.

01:34:47.125 --> 01:34:50.354
I think I should go on stage tonight, instead of you.

01:34:50.750 --> 01:34:52.594
Arthur, come on, give us a hand with this.

01:34:53.917 --> 01:34:57.677
Come on. Come on. My God, I'm stuck.

01:34:58.865 --> 01:35:01.323
Stop moving about, I'm doing me eyeliner.

01:35:03.896 --> 01:35:05.969
I've been entwined my body... pull off!

01:35:06.031 --> 01:35:09.750
And it's great to see you're mad for me, yeah

01:35:09.750 --> 01:35:13.250
I'm your toy, your 20th century boy

01:35:13.781 --> 01:35:19.969
20th century boy, I wanna be your toy

01:35:20.573 --> 01:35:26.958
20th century boy, I wanna be your toy

01:35:27.573 --> 01:35:33.802
20th century boy, I wanna be your toy

01:35:34.490 --> 01:35:40.677
20th century boy, I wanna be your toy

01:35:40.948 --> 01:35:44.333
Friends say it's fine, friends say it's good

01:35:44.333 --> 01:35:48.646
Everybody says it's just like Rock and Roll

01:35:54.646 --> 01:35:58.188
I move like a cat, talk like a rat

01:35:58.188 --> 01:36:00.219
Yeah, I'm try to reach Curt Wild.

01:36:01.344 --> 01:36:02.990
I'm a journalist from the Herald.

01:36:03.760 --> 01:36:05.198
#NAME?

01:36:10.635 --> 01:36:12.719
Hi, yeah. My name is Arthur Stuart,

01:36:12.719 --> 01:36:13.708
from the Herald.

01:36:15.229 --> 01:36:17.344
I was... I was given this number

01:36:17.344 --> 01:36:20.052
and told I could reach Curt Wild here.

01:36:21.323 --> 01:36:22.219
Listen...

01:36:22.677 --> 01:36:27.406
Yeah. Hello? Hello!?

01:36:27.625 --> 01:36:29.719
Listen, I don't know who the hell gave you this number,

01:36:29.719 --> 01:36:31.125
but Curt Wild is not available

01:36:31.125 --> 01:36:32.583
and not interested in granting you

01:36:33.906 --> 01:36:35.167
or anyone else an interview on this subject.

01:36:35.167 --> 01:36:35.740
You got it?

01:36:36.823 --> 01:36:38.698
I'm sorry. I was told...

01:37:00.115 --> 01:37:02.292
Oh cheeky cheeky

01:37:03.229 --> 01:37:05.365
Oh naughty sneaky

01:37:09.719 --> 01:37:14.396
You're so perceptive, and I wonder how you knew

01:37:20.615 --> 01:37:25.188
But these finks don't walk too well

01:37:26.042 --> 01:37:30.292
A bad sense of direction

01:37:31.438 --> 01:37:34.167
And so they stumble round in threes

01:37:34.354 --> 01:37:36.885
The tour will be a tremendous success.

01:37:36.885 --> 01:37:38.615
And due to the overwhelming demand,

01:37:38.615 --> 01:37:40.073
there will be additional shows added

01:37:40.073 --> 01:37:42.260
whenever and wherever possible.

01:37:42.260 --> 01:37:42.865
Regretfully,

01:37:42.875 --> 01:37:45.625
Mr. Stone only has left a few questions

01:37:45.625 --> 01:37:48.198
as he has a plain to catch the train.

01:37:54.063 --> 01:37:56.052
You're always so charming

01:37:57.604 --> 01:38:02.292
As you make your way up here

01:38:18.375 --> 01:38:21.354
Lou. Lou.

01:38:24.125 --> 01:38:26.906
Lou! Lou!

01:38:28.521 --> 01:38:30.052
Sorry guy, but I'm late.

01:38:30.052 --> 01:38:30.906
I think I'm onto something.

01:38:30.906 --> 01:38:32.323
#NAME?

01:38:32.323 --> 01:38:33.583
I think I know who Brian Slade is.

01:38:33.583 --> 01:38:35.406
Oh, that story's been dropped.

01:38:35.719 --> 01:38:36.771
What? Why?

01:38:36.771 --> 01:38:38.500
I need you on the Stone show.

01:38:38.771 --> 01:38:40.021
That's it?

01:38:41.250 --> 01:38:42.979
What they say to you?

01:38:44.052 --> 01:38:45.042
Lou!

01:39:16.635 --> 01:39:20.552
Gimme danger, little stranger

01:39:20.552 --> 01:39:24.406
And I'll feel you bleed

01:39:24.510 --> 01:39:28.219
Gimme danger, little stranger

01:39:28.406 --> 01:39:32.125
And I'll heal your disease

01:39:32.906 --> 01:39:36.271
There's nothing in my dreams

01:39:36.281 --> 01:39:40.281
But some ugly memories

01:39:41.042 --> 01:39:45.042
Kiss me like the ocean breeze

01:39:52.281 --> 01:39:55.875
Now if you will be my lover

01:39:56.146 --> 01:39:59.760
I will shiver and sing

01:40:00.313 --> 01:40:04.031
But if you will be my master

01:40:04.031 --> 01:40:07.563
Then I will do anything

01:40:08.490 --> 01:40:11.906
There's nothing left alive

01:40:11.906 --> 01:40:15.969
But a pair of dark glassy eyes

01:40:16.573 --> 01:40:20.646
Raise my fears one more time

01:40:27.458 --> 01:40:32.021
Come on little danger, die a little stranger

01:40:32.021 --> 01:40:35.094
Swear you're gonna feel my hands

01:40:36.167 --> 01:40:39.802
Right on little stranger, try a little danger

01:40:39.802 --> 01:40:43.146
Swear you're gonna feel my hands

01:40:43.875 --> 01:40:46.885
Swear you're gonna feel my hands

01:40:47.698 --> 01:40:50.865
Swear you're gonna feel my hands

01:41:50.188 --> 01:41:53.302
Danger

01:41:54.313 --> 01:41:56.802
Stranger

01:41:57.917 --> 01:42:00.802
Gimme danger

01:42:01.760 --> 01:42:04.531
Little stranger

01:42:05.292 --> 01:42:08.813
Gimme danger

01:42:09.375 --> 01:42:12.948
Everyday

01:42:13.302 --> 01:42:16.635
Can you feel it

01:42:16.927 --> 01:42:20.531
Can you feel it

01:42:20.771 --> 01:42:24.521
Can you feel it

01:42:24.688 --> 01:42:28.313
Can you feel it

01:42:28.615 --> 01:42:32.333
I got a feeling

01:42:32.500 --> 01:42:36.156
Yeah, I got a feeling

01:42:37.385 --> 01:42:41.125
I got a feeling, got a feeling

01:42:41.156 --> 01:42:44.979
I got a feeling, I got a feeling

01:42:45.010 --> 01:42:48.583
I wanna feel it

01:42:48.583 --> 01:42:52.323
I wanna feel it

01:42:53.156 --> 01:42:55.635
I wanna feel it

01:42:55.635 --> 01:42:58.719
I wanna feel it, feel it

01:42:58.813 --> 01:43:04.146
I wanna feel it, I wanna fucking feel it

01:43:04.208 --> 01:43:06.677
I wanna feel it

01:43:06.688 --> 01:43:12.094
I wanna feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it

01:43:33.333 --> 01:43:36.042
#NAME?

01:43:36.042 --> 01:43:38.542
#NAME?

01:43:42.667 --> 01:43:45.688
- Did you see him? - No, I didn't see him.

01:44:12.146 --> 01:44:14.042
It's only now, looking back that I see

01:44:14.625 --> 01:44:18.990
how you patched through my walls

01:44:18.990 --> 01:44:21.177
and entered my life in waves.

01:44:23.896 --> 01:44:25.073
Come closer.

01:44:30.542 --> 01:44:31.688
Don't be frightened.

01:44:33.729 --> 01:44:35.000
What's your name?

01:44:35.396 --> 01:44:39.448
Your favourite colour? Song? Movie?

01:44:41.333 --> 01:44:46.406
- Don't be nervous. Are you high? - I'm on a button.

01:44:52.750 --> 01:44:54.125
He was waiting for me.

01:44:56.740 --> 01:44:58.198
I'd followed his signals

01:44:58.198 --> 01:45:02.521
and slipped away and now, suddenly...

01:45:11.438 --> 01:45:12.490
Hey!

01:45:16.948 --> 01:45:17.979
Make a wish!

01:45:57.188 --> 01:45:58.094
Hey!

01:46:13.771 --> 01:46:15.250
Make a wish!

01:46:16.573 --> 01:46:21.781
And see yourself, on-stage, inside-out.

01:46:23.365 --> 01:46:25.646
A tangle of garlands in your hair.

01:46:26.896 --> 01:46:29.292
Of course you were pleasantly surprised.

01:46:30.531 --> 01:46:32.604
Softly, he said:

01:46:32.646 --> 01:46:33.750
Gee, but it's hard

01:46:33.938 --> 01:46:36.500
I will mangle your mind.

01:46:36.813 --> 01:46:42.010
When one lowers one's guard to the vultures

01:46:44.125 --> 01:46:47.000
Now, me I regard it

01:46:47.000 --> 01:46:53.563
A torturous hardship that smolders

01:46:55.781 --> 01:47:00.063
Like a peppermint eaten away

01:47:01.667 --> 01:47:06.438
Will I fight? Will I swagger, or sway

01:47:08.073 --> 01:47:10.760
Tee hee, milady

01:47:10.760 --> 01:47:17.323
She cries like a baby, scold us

01:47:17.625 --> 01:47:23.729
See her tumbling down

01:47:23.729 --> 01:47:28.260
See her tumbling down

01:47:31.458 --> 01:47:34.167
Heil to the monkey

01:47:34.167 --> 01:47:40.771
We're having a funky reunion

01:47:43.094 --> 01:47:45.417
Wasted and sunk

01:47:45.417 --> 01:47:52.500
He can only have Sunday communion

01:47:54.302 --> 01:47:59.177
He's got nicotine stains in his eyes

01:48:00.188 --> 01:48:05.115
He's got nothing to protect but his pride

01:48:06.281 --> 01:48:08.656
Oh smothered a kiss

01:48:08.656 --> 01:48:15.313
Or be drowned in blissful confusion

01:48:16.344 --> 01:48:22.385
See her tumbling down

01:48:22.385 --> 01:48:27.135
See her tumbling down

01:48:28.135 --> 01:48:33.813
See her tumbling down

01:48:34.594 --> 01:48:37.781
Tumbling down

01:49:48.469 --> 01:49:49.771
Tommy! Where did you get the idea

01:49:49.771 --> 01:49:51.802
for such a spectacular stadium show?

01:49:51.802 --> 01:49:54.990
To tell you the truth? It's a bloody pain in the ass!

01:49:55.698 --> 01:49:57.760
The whole thing takes six full size rigs

01:49:57.760 --> 01:50:00.042
or three chartered planes to transport.

01:50:00.042 --> 01:50:01.771
What can I say? I think big!

01:50:02.573 --> 01:50:03.365
Tommy! Over here!

01:50:03.365 --> 01:50:05.396
Tommy! What's your opinion on the work

01:50:05.396 --> 01:50:07.438
that President Reynolds has been doing?

01:50:07.438 --> 01:50:08.406
Excellent. Excellent.

01:50:08.406 --> 01:50:09.750
I think he's doing brilliant work.

01:50:09.750 --> 01:50:13.448
He's a tremendous leader, a tremendous spokesperson

01:50:13.458 --> 01:50:14.656
for the needs of the nation today.

01:50:14.656 --> 01:50:15.094
Tommy!

01:50:15.094 --> 01:50:16.604
What's your response to the recent allegations

01:50:16.604 --> 01:50:20.323
connecting you with bisexual pop-singer Brian Slade

01:50:20.323 --> 01:50:21.875
who staged his own assassination

01:50:21.875 --> 01:50:23.365
ten years ago this week in London?

01:50:23.365 --> 01:50:25.646
...that Mr Stone has time for this evening.

01:50:25.646 --> 01:50:26.625
Thank you very much!

01:50:31.844 --> 01:50:34.667
Out! Out! Get out!

01:50:34.802 --> 01:50:37.146
Now! Out!

01:50:37.198 --> 01:50:39.333
Stone is promoting his Grammy-winning release,

01:50:39.333 --> 01:50:42.427
People Rockin' People,

01:50:42.427 --> 01:50:43.063
to sold-out arenas worldwide.

01:51:08.073 --> 01:51:09.375
Beer, please.

01:51:22.177 --> 01:51:24.208
Excuse me? Sir?

01:51:25.323 --> 01:51:27.417
Are you with the Tommy Stone Tour?

01:51:31.802 --> 01:51:35.552
No. I'm just a journalist.

01:51:37.615 --> 01:51:41.781
Perhaps you'd like my... press pass?

01:51:42.271 --> 01:51:43.542
As a souvenir?

01:51:45.167 --> 01:51:46.229
Thanks sir.

01:52:19.510 --> 01:52:20.771
You're Curt Wild.

01:52:23.021 --> 01:52:25.510
Yeah. Who the hell are you?

01:52:28.104 --> 01:52:31.250
I'm a journalist. From the Herald.

01:52:35.125 --> 01:52:36.375
You were at the concert?

01:52:40.000 --> 01:52:41.542
It's just funny, cause...

01:52:41.542 --> 01:52:44.927
I was trying to contact you, actually.

01:52:46.000 --> 01:52:47.625
About a story I was doing,

01:52:47.625 --> 01:52:49.854
about an old friend of yours.

01:52:51.677 --> 01:52:53.021
Brian Slade?

01:52:56.490 --> 01:52:58.552
I was trying to find out what actually happened to him.

01:52:58.552 --> 01:53:00.333
#NAME?

01:53:02.854 --> 01:53:04.115
such a mystery.

01:53:07.156 --> 01:53:08.802
Look, man, I don't know who you've been talking to

01:53:08.802 --> 01:53:10.344
or what you're after here.

01:53:10.344 --> 01:53:11.188
What?

01:53:14.688 --> 01:53:15.521
What?!

01:53:18.135 --> 01:53:20.646
Listen! A real artist creates beautiful things

01:53:20.656 --> 01:53:23.406
and puts nothing of his won life into them. Okay?

01:53:24.125 --> 01:53:26.292
#NAME?

01:53:28.677 --> 01:53:30.708
We set out to change the world.

01:53:32.823 --> 01:53:34.781
Ended up just changing ourselves.

01:53:36.771 --> 01:53:37.865
What's wrong with that?

01:53:40.844 --> 01:53:41.646
Nothing.

01:53:43.938 --> 01:53:45.469
If you don't look at the world.

01:53:58.156 --> 01:54:00.208
Well, I guess in the end he got what he wanted.

01:54:10.281 --> 01:54:13.917
- That's quite a pin you got there. - Oh yeah.

01:54:14.479 --> 01:54:15.344
Is it old?

01:54:16.260 --> 01:54:19.844
Possibly. It belonged to Oscar Wilde.

01:54:21.021 --> 01:54:23.573
Or so I was told by the person who gave it to me.

01:54:25.552 --> 01:54:29.854
A friend of mine. Kinda disappeared some years back.

01:54:33.958 --> 01:54:36.552
I forget where we were. We were on a trip.

01:54:37.281 --> 01:54:38.104
But he said to me,

01:54:38.104 --> 01:54:42.667
Curt, A man's life is his image.

01:54:55.510 --> 01:54:58.958
- Here. Why don't you hang on to it? - Me?

01:54:59.521 --> 01:55:00.865
Sure. Why not?

01:55:01.656 --> 01:55:05.208
I've had it too long anyway. Go ahead.

01:55:08.302 --> 01:55:09.500
For your image.

01:55:15.260 --> 01:55:19.135
Really. I couldn't.

01:55:22.635 --> 01:55:23.688
But thanks.

01:55:31.333 --> 01:55:33.563
God, I love this song.

01:55:36.406 --> 01:55:38.781
#NAME?

01:55:42.073 --> 01:55:44.240
- See ya around. - Cheers!

01:56:14.823 --> 01:56:16.448
He called it a freedom.

01:56:19.958 --> 01:56:22.469
A freedom you can allow yourself.

01:56:26.354 --> 01:56:27.583
Or not.

01:56:31.833 --> 01:56:37.542
Oh I was moved by your screen dream

01:56:38.479 --> 01:56:44.375
Celluloid pictures of living

01:56:44.521 --> 01:56:51.313
Your death could not kill our love for you

01:56:54.823 --> 01:57:00.854
Take two people romantic

01:57:01.260 --> 01:57:07.177
Smoky nightclub situation

01:57:07.406 --> 01:57:13.438
Your cigarette traces a ladder

01:57:16.406 --> 01:57:19.781
Here's looking at you kid

01:57:19.927 --> 01:57:22.833
Celebrate years

01:57:22.833 --> 01:57:26.271
Here's looking at you kid

01:57:26.354 --> 01:57:29.813
Wipe away tears

01:57:29.813 --> 01:57:36.000
Long time, since we're together

01:57:36.073 --> 01:57:40.000
Now I hope it's forever

01:58:32.219 --> 01:58:38.531
Here's looking at you kid, hard to forget

01:58:38.885 --> 01:58:42.458
Here's looking at you kid,

01:58:42.458 --> 01:58:45.063
At least not yet

01:58:45.490 --> 01:58:52.208
Your memory stays, it lingers ever

01:58:52.479 --> 01:58:56.365
Will fade away never

01:58:59.125 --> 01:59:01.948
Fade away never

01:59:05.813 --> 01:59:08.104
Fade away never

01:59:22.146 --> 01:59:24.448
You've done it all

01:59:25.146 --> 01:59:27.906
You've broken every code

01:59:29.323 --> 01:59:34.771
And pulled the rebel to the floor

01:59:36.104 --> 01:59:41.729
You spoilt the game, no matter what you say

01:59:42.896 --> 01:59:48.448
For only metal - what a bore

01:59:49.990 --> 01:59:52.448
Blue eyes, blue eyes

01:59:53.323 --> 01:59:59.313
How come you tell so many lies

02:00:00.125 --> 02:00:06.323
Come up and see me, make me smile

02:00:06.708 --> 02:00:13.375
Or do what you want, running wild

02:00:15.240 --> 02:00:17.458
There's nothing left

02:00:17.771 --> 02:00:21.323
All gone and run away

02:00:22.427 --> 02:00:27.094
Maybe you'll tarry for awhile

02:00:22.427 --> 02:00:27.094
Maybe you'll tarry for awhile

02:00:22.427 --> 02:00:27.094
Maybe you'll tarry for awhile

02:00:29.000 --> 02:00:35.010
It's just a test, a game for us to play

02:00:29.000 --> 02:00:35.010
It's just a test, a game for us to play

02:00:29.000 --> 02:00:35.010
It's just a test, a game for us to play

02:00:36.146 --> 02:00:41.240
Win or lose, it's hard to smile

02:00:36.146 --> 02:00:41.240
Win or lose, it's hard to smile

02:00:36.146 --> 02:00:41.240
Win or lose, it's hard to smile

02:00:42.719 --> 02:00:45.094
Resist, resist

02:00:42.719 --> 02:00:45.094
Resist, resist

02:00:42.719 --> 02:00:45.094
Resist, resist

02:00:46.135 --> 02:00:51.990
It's from yourself you have to hide

02:00:46.135 --> 02:00:51.990
It's from yourself you have to hide

02:00:46.135 --> 02:00:51.990
It's from yourself you have to hide

02:00:52.813 --> 02:00:59.063
Come up and see me to make me smile

02:00:52.813 --> 02:00:59.063
Come up and see me to make me smile

02:00:52.813 --> 02:00:59.063
Come up and see me to make me smile

02:00:59.385 --> 02:01:06.052
Oh, or do what you want, running wild

02:00:59.385 --> 02:01:06.052
Oh, or do what you want, running wild

02:00:59.385 --> 02:01:06.052
Oh, or do what you want, running wild

02:01:37.708 --> 02:01:39.948
There ain't no more

02:01:37.708 --> 02:01:39.948
There ain't no more

02:01:37.708 --> 02:01:39.948
There ain't no more

02:01:40.354 --> 02:01:43.104
You've taken everything

02:01:40.354 --> 02:01:43.104
You've taken everything

02:01:40.354 --> 02:01:43.104
You've taken everything

02:01:44.625 --> 02:01:51.031
From my belief in Mother Earth

02:01:44.625 --> 02:01:51.031
From my belief in Mother Earth

02:01:44.625 --> 02:01:51.031
From my belief in Mother Earth

02:01:51.385 --> 02:01:57.854
Can you ignore my faith in everything

02:01:51.385 --> 02:01:57.854
Can you ignore my faith in everything

02:01:51.385 --> 02:01:57.854
Can you ignore my faith in everything

02:01:58.167 --> 02:02:04.615
'Cause I know what faith is and what it's worth

02:01:58.167 --> 02:02:04.615
'Cause I know what faith is and what it's worth

02:01:58.167 --> 02:02:04.615
'Cause I know what faith is and what it's worth

02:02:04.979 --> 02:02:07.156
Away, away

02:02:04.979 --> 02:02:07.156
Away, away

02:02:04.979 --> 02:02:07.156
Away, away

02:02:08.271 --> 02:02:14.719
And don't say maybe you'll try

02:02:08.271 --> 02:02:14.719
And don't say maybe you'll try

02:02:08.271 --> 02:02:14.719
And don't say maybe you'll try

02:02:08.271 --> 02:02:14.719
And don't say maybe you'll try

02:02:15.156 --> 02:02:21.750
Oh, to come up and see me to make me smile

02:02:15.156 --> 02:02:21.750
Oh, to come up and see me to make me smile

02:02:15.156 --> 02:02:21.750
Oh, to come up and see me to make me smile

02:02:15.156 --> 02:02:21.750
Oh, to come up and see me to make me smile

02:02:21.823 --> 02:02:28.677
Or do what you want, just running wild

02:02:21.823 --> 02:02:28.677
Or do what you want, just running wild

02:02:21.823 --> 02:02:28.677
Or do what you want, just running wild

02:02:21.823 --> 02:02:28.677
Or do what you want, just running wild

02:02:40.844 --> 02:02:46.958
Come up and see me, make me smile

02:02:40.844 --> 02:02:46.958
Come up and see me, make me smile

02:02:40.844 --> 02:02:46.958
Come up and see me, make me smile

02:02:40.844 --> 02:02:46.958
Come up and see me, make me smile

02:02:47.438 --> 02:02:54.313
Or do what you want, running wild

02:02:47.438 --> 02:02:54.313
Or do what you want, running wild

02:02:47.438 --> 02:02:54.313
Or do what you want, running wild

02:02:47.438 --> 02:02:54.313
Or do what you want, running wild

02:03:06.354 --> 02:03:12.500
Come up and see me, make me smile

02:03:06.354 --> 02:03:12.500
Come up and see me, make me smile

02:03:06.354 --> 02:03:12.500
Come up and see me, make me smile

02:03:06.354 --> 02:03:12.500
Come up and see me, make me smile
