00:36.035 --> 00:37.578
Ugh! This sucks, Mom.

00:37.579 --> 00:39.371
We really have
to spend the whole day

00:39.372 --> 00:40.581
cleaning out the garage?

00:40.582 --> 00:42.249
Yeah, come on, Lois.

00:42.250 --> 00:44.835
You know I have plans today
to go see Pervert Hamlet.

00:44.836 --> 00:45.878
To be...

00:45.879 --> 00:48.005
with this skull sexually,

00:48.006 --> 00:49.965
or not to be...

00:49.966 --> 00:52.050
with this skull sexually.

00:52.051 --> 00:54.386
That is the question...

00:54.387 --> 00:58.015
I answered when I was
with this skull sexually

00:58.016 --> 01:00.393
a little while ago.

01:01.978 --> 01:04.646
Huh. All these spray paint cans
are empty.

01:04.647 --> 01:06.857
What? Really?

01:06.858 --> 01:08.942
H-How could such a thing

01:08.943 --> 01:10.945
have come to pass?

01:13.031 --> 01:14.948
Screw this. Quick,
before your mother gets back,

01:14.949 --> 01:16.200
everything in the garbage.

01:16.201 --> 01:17.702
We're throwing
all this stuff out.

01:23.166 --> 01:25.292
Wait. You're throwing away
Stewie's Big Wheel?

01:25.293 --> 01:27.085
Relax. It's not even his.

01:27.086 --> 01:29.464
I took it from a front lawn
after a rain storm.

01:33.218 --> 01:36.930
I thought they'd never leave,
Factory Red.

01:40.308 --> 01:42.267
So, I guess
Thanos got the Mind Stone.

01:42.268 --> 01:44.144
Wow. So now he's got all of 'em.

01:44.145 --> 01:46.230
- I guess so.
- What does that mean for us?

01:46.231 --> 01:48.273
I have no idea.

01:48.274 --> 01:50.360
I knew it was gonna be us.

01:51.861 --> 01:55.572
Oh, my God. There's a hot woman
over at the bar.

01:55.573 --> 01:58.116
You know, I never forget
the back of a head.

01:58.117 --> 02:00.828
I don't think we've met.
I'm Glenn Quagmire.

02:00.829 --> 02:02.830
I'm sure that kind of thing
works great

02:02.831 --> 02:05.332
for the younger crowd,
but I'm 44.

02:05.333 --> 02:07.793
44? Oh-ho,
why am I trying so hard?

02:07.794 --> 02:09.461
Come on, let's get out of here.

02:09.461 --> 02:12.715
Look, I'm not some bimbo who
falls for tired pickup lines.

02:14.217 --> 02:16.009
Wow. That was painful.

02:16.010 --> 02:18.929
Like that time I passed
a kidney Stone Phillips.

02:18.930 --> 02:20.430
Oh!

02:20.431 --> 02:22.099
Aah! Aah!

02:23.393 --> 02:25.979
Or was it... murder?

02:29.399 --> 02:31.275
- Hey, Doug.
- Hey, Stewie.

02:31.276 --> 02:33.151
Taking the Big Wheel out
for a spin?

02:33.152 --> 02:34.486
Yep. Where are you headed?

02:34.487 --> 02:36.613
Oh, I was just gonna
drive through some puddles

02:36.614 --> 02:38.365
and see how long
my tracks stay wet.

02:38.366 --> 02:41.285
The record is seven sidewalk
squares, by yours truly.

02:41.286 --> 02:42.995
Allegedly.

02:42.996 --> 02:44.998
Okay, get out of here, you nut.

02:47.959 --> 02:50.378
What the deuce? Where is it?

02:58.219 --> 03:01.346
Boy, I tell ya,
no better way to start your day

03:01.347 --> 03:03.265
than a morning dump
in a neighbor's yard.

03:03.266 --> 03:04.808
Come on, Brian!

03:04.809 --> 03:07.936
It was a soft steamer,
almost impossible to pick up.

03:07.937 --> 03:09.855
Brian, have you seen
my Big Wheel?

03:09.856 --> 03:11.273
I can't find it anywhere!

03:11.274 --> 03:12.524
What? No. Did you look...?

03:12.525 --> 03:13.942
Oh, wait a minute.

03:13.943 --> 03:16.028
Peter threw out a bunch of stuff
from the garage yesterday.

03:16.029 --> 03:17.613
Maybe it was in there.

03:17.614 --> 03:21.200
Threw it out? But today
is our trash pick up day!

03:22.952 --> 03:24.244
We're too late!

03:24.245 --> 03:26.121
I've got to get
that Big Wheel back.

03:26.122 --> 03:27.956
Will you drive me
to the town dump?

03:27.957 --> 03:30.626
Really? Can't we just maybe
buy you a new one?

03:30.627 --> 03:32.461
No, Brian.
It has to be that Big Wheel.

03:32.462 --> 03:34.463
It's very special to me.

03:34.464 --> 03:36.256
I lost my V-card on that thing.

03:36.257 --> 03:37.799
You what?

03:37.800 --> 03:40.594
Yep, went over a speed bump
really fast and broke my hymen.

03:40.595 --> 03:42.220
Stewie, you don't have a hymen.

03:42.221 --> 03:44.097
- Yeah, not anymore.
- No, you're a boy.

03:44.098 --> 03:46.725
I have to correct you there,
Brian. I'm a man.

03:46.726 --> 03:48.393
'Cause, you know...
broken hymen.

03:48.394 --> 03:50.312
Boys don't have hymens!

03:50.313 --> 03:52.856
Okay, then I may have just
ripped my taint.

03:52.857 --> 03:55.109
Either way, I love that bike!

04:00.156 --> 04:01.406
Hi. Can you help us?

04:01.407 --> 04:03.283
We're trying
to locate a lost Big Wh...

04:03.284 --> 04:04.826
My God,

04:04.827 --> 04:06.828
there's just so...

04:06.829 --> 04:08.997
much... garbage.

04:12.335 --> 04:14.503
Yes, we are in search
of a Big Wheel

04:14.504 --> 04:17.089
that was erroneously discarded
and collected today.

04:17.089 --> 04:20.759
Oh, then it probably came in
with the morning load.

04:20.760 --> 04:23.178
Sorry. That term always
makes me blush.

04:23.179 --> 04:26.348
But if it just came in,
that's bad news.

04:26.349 --> 04:28.725
Usually the newest,
top layer of trash

04:28.726 --> 04:30.853
just blows right into the ocean.

04:35.066 --> 04:38.026
Yeah, I'm afraid your Big Wheel
may be gones for good.

04:38.027 --> 04:40.362
Dear God, this is horrible!

04:40.363 --> 04:42.407
I'm blind! I'm blind! I'm blind!

04:43.741 --> 04:46.994
Phew. Ooh, something smells good
in this box.

04:46.995 --> 04:49.664
I'm blind! I'm blind! I'm blind!

04:53.668 --> 04:57.170
Damn it. Monica's not responding
to any of my texts.

04:57.171 --> 04:59.756
You're still tryin'
to bang that 44-year-old?

04:59.757 --> 05:01.258
- What are you sending her?
- Mostly porn.

05:01.259 --> 05:02.592
Just shots of rods.

05:02.593 --> 05:04.845
All angles.
Up, down, left, right.

05:04.846 --> 05:07.806
Lois, maybe you could help me
ask out this woman I met.

05:07.807 --> 05:09.182
She's close to your age.

05:09.183 --> 05:11.226
But she won't respond
to any of my texts.

05:11.227 --> 05:12.561
Oh, well, that's easy.

05:12.562 --> 05:15.398
Just ask her if she's all
caught up on This Is Us.

05:18.067 --> 05:21.069
She says, "I'm one behind,
so no spoilers.

05:21.070 --> 05:24.698
Hysterical laughing face,
hysterical laughing face."

05:24.699 --> 05:26.241
How-how is that funny?

05:26.242 --> 05:27.701
It's not, but you're in.

05:27.702 --> 05:30.078
Great. This is exactly
the stuff I need to know.

05:30.079 --> 05:33.248
Lois, will you teach me the ways
of the middle-aged woman?

05:33.249 --> 05:35.542
All right.
I'm a sucker for romance.

05:35.543 --> 05:38.378
Thanks, Lois. This could open up
a whole new world for me.

05:38.379 --> 05:40.505
Like one of those kids
who gets a device

05:40.506 --> 05:43.009
that allows them to hear
for the first time.

05:44.093 --> 05:45.927
Billy, can you hear?

05:45.928 --> 05:47.345
Yes!

05:47.346 --> 05:49.598
Amazing! This is amazing.

05:49.599 --> 05:52.059
Your mom and I are going
to get a divorce.

05:52.060 --> 05:53.560
I'm in love with someone else,

05:53.561 --> 05:56.355
and I didn't want
to say it with the silly hands.

06:00.735 --> 06:03.111
Brian, I've been doing research
on my Big Wheel.

06:03.112 --> 06:04.821
If it ended up in the ocean,

06:04.822 --> 06:07.282
it most likely has traveled
to Garbage Island.

06:07.283 --> 06:08.992
What's Garbage Island?

06:08.993 --> 06:11.828
The other name for the
North Atlantic Garbage Patch,

06:11.829 --> 06:13.538
an enormous cluster
of man-made debris

06:13.539 --> 06:15.457
floating in the middle
of the ocean.

06:15.458 --> 06:17.459
This is terrible.
We got to raise awareness,

06:17.460 --> 06:19.294
- let people know about it.
- I agree.

06:19.295 --> 06:21.631
It's like
a giant garbage whirlpool.

06:23.424 --> 06:25.592
Brian?

06:25.593 --> 06:27.594
You heard me.

06:27.595 --> 06:29.930
Anyway, I'm heading there
to find my Big Wheel.

06:29.931 --> 06:31.264
Perhaps you'll come with me.

06:31.265 --> 06:32.808
Boating to an island of garbage?

06:32.809 --> 06:35.102
I'm in.
Maybe Peter will come, too.

06:35.103 --> 06:37.229
Hey, Peter,
want to go on a boat ride?

06:37.230 --> 06:40.774
Oh, uh, I can't be in stories
for a couple of episodes.

06:40.775 --> 06:43.111
I'm real-life pregnant.

06:44.320 --> 06:46.196
Oh, my God. I had no idea.

06:46.197 --> 06:47.405
I know!

06:47.406 --> 06:49.992
Anyway, Mama's got to
get off her feet.

06:57.291 --> 07:00.710
All right, time to retrieve my
Big Wheel from Garbage Island.

07:00.711 --> 07:02.879
Let's do it.

07:02.880 --> 07:05.132
Hey, how'd you get the money
to rent this boat anyway?

07:05.133 --> 07:07.468
Oh, I got a part-time job
at Target.

07:11.848 --> 07:15.225
Okay, technically, I work at
the weird, in-store Pizza Hut.

07:15.226 --> 07:17.144
The Target In-Store Pizza Hut.

07:17.145 --> 07:21.023
Feed it to your fat kid while
you buy off-brand tennis shoes.

07:24.610 --> 07:27.028
Now, Glenn, I'm gonna help you
get into the mind

07:27.029 --> 07:28.446
of a middle-aged woman.

07:28.447 --> 07:31.491
Step one: we all go friggin'
nuts over Yankee Candles,

07:31.492 --> 07:34.703
so to help you learn all the
flavors, I made a little quiz.

07:34.704 --> 07:37.038
I'm gonna give you a name,
and you tell me

07:37.039 --> 07:39.791
if it's the name of
a Yankee Candle or a porn star.

07:39.792 --> 07:42.043
- Okay.
- Black Coconut.

07:42.044 --> 07:43.295
Porn star?

07:43.296 --> 07:46.131
No, that's a candle.
Amber Gold.

07:46.132 --> 07:48.592
- Candle?
- That is a candle.

07:48.593 --> 07:50.594
April Showers.

07:50.595 --> 07:52.596
Um... both?

07:52.597 --> 07:56.808
Very good. I tried to trick you
there, but you got it. Both.

07:56.809 --> 07:58.476
Okay, okay,
I'm writing this all down.

07:58.477 --> 08:01.605
But, Lois, Monica agreed
to have dinner with me tomorrow.

08:01.606 --> 08:02.731
That's great!

08:02.732 --> 08:04.024
I suppose.

08:04.025 --> 08:06.401
But I don't think
I can pull it off by myself.

08:06.402 --> 08:07.944
Will you come and just be nearby

08:07.945 --> 08:09.946
to give me tips and help me
get through it?

08:09.947 --> 08:12.157
Fine, but I'll have
to rearrange my schedule.

08:12.158 --> 08:14.451
Friday nights are when
Peter and I do edibles

08:14.452 --> 08:16.120
and go to the aquarium.

08:19.498 --> 08:21.499
This is awesome.

08:21.500 --> 08:24.044
Peter, I'm freaking out.

08:24.045 --> 08:26.756
Yeah, don't-don't...
don't ruin it for me.

08:28.000 --> 08:34.073
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

08:36.557 --> 08:40.059
Okay, I spy something blue.

08:40.061 --> 08:42.729
Uh... the ocean?

08:42.730 --> 08:44.231
Nope.

08:44.232 --> 08:45.565
The sky?

08:45.566 --> 08:47.192
Hey, you got it in two, bud.

08:47.193 --> 08:48.443
That ties the record.

08:48.444 --> 08:49.653
Stewie, I'm starting to wonder

08:49.654 --> 08:51.696
if we didn't think this
all the way through.

08:51.697 --> 08:53.114
No, it's fine.

08:53.115 --> 08:56.284
It'll all be worth it
once we get to Garbage Island.

08:56.285 --> 08:58.203
Not a lot of wind today.

08:58.204 --> 08:59.788
No.

08:59.789 --> 09:01.581
Hey, what causes wind?

09:01.582 --> 09:03.833
Well, if my reading material
has taught me anything,

09:03.834 --> 09:06.254
it's just a cloud with lips.

09:08.339 --> 09:10.340
Blustery...

09:10.341 --> 09:12.133
is a good word.

09:12.134 --> 09:13.593
Uh-huh.

09:13.594 --> 09:16.013
Mm... Moana.

09:17.014 --> 09:19.599
Mm.

09:19.600 --> 09:21.936
I never saw Moana.

09:22.937 --> 09:25.856
You never saw Moana?

09:51.841 --> 09:53.341
Your blowout looks nice.

09:53.342 --> 09:54.759
Oh, thanks.

09:54.760 --> 09:58.388
So, um, I noticed a yoga mat
in the back of your car.

09:58.389 --> 10:00.850
How often do you do yoga?

10:13.821 --> 10:15.363
- Is everything all right?
- Hmm?

10:15.364 --> 10:16.740
Oh, oh, yeah, yeah. Sorry.

10:16.741 --> 10:19.576
My, um... my-my dad
locked himself out of his car.

10:19.577 --> 10:21.619
Oh, sorry.
Do you need to help him?

10:21.620 --> 10:23.496
Um, no, uh, no.
He, um, he broke, uh...

10:23.497 --> 10:24.831
broke the window with his foot.

10:24.832 --> 10:27.083
High heel. My dad's a woman now.

10:27.084 --> 10:29.628
Oh.

10:36.594 --> 10:38.219
You're lucky we came here.

10:38.220 --> 10:40.013
I almost suggested Mickey D's.

10:40.014 --> 10:42.640
Oh, my God.

10:42.641 --> 10:44.017
That's so informal.

10:44.018 --> 10:45.685
Are you talking
about McDonald's?

10:45.686 --> 10:47.437
Yeah, yeah!

10:47.438 --> 10:49.522
Another thing
I was just thinking about is...

10:49.523 --> 10:51.483
"AMBER Alert,
white Honda Accord,

10:51.484 --> 10:53.276
license plate..."
Uh, uh, I mean,

10:53.277 --> 10:56.112
Pinterest sure has
some neat pictures of sinks.

10:56.113 --> 10:57.697
Doesn't it?

10:57.698 --> 10:59.824
Listen, what if we just bail
on dinner

10:59.825 --> 11:01.701
and head back to my place?

11:01.702 --> 11:02.912
Great! I'm in.

11:08.584 --> 11:10.418
Wait! You have to pay
for the bread.

11:10.419 --> 11:12.004
Hey!

11:12.880 --> 11:15.383
You have to pay for the bread!

11:17.259 --> 11:18.927
You have to pay for the bread!

11:18.928 --> 11:21.262
You have to pay
for the bread!

11:21.263 --> 11:22.514
The bread!

11:22.515 --> 11:25.058
You have to pay

11:25.059 --> 11:26.726
for the bread!

11:36.404 --> 11:38.364
Moana?

11:42.368 --> 11:43.701
Oh, my God. Brian.

11:43.702 --> 11:45.079
Look!

11:49.250 --> 11:50.875
We made it!

11:50.876 --> 11:52.961
We made it to Garbage Island!

11:52.962 --> 11:55.255
My God, I don't believe it.

11:55.256 --> 11:57.715
Whoa, look at all the packaging
from Mickey D's.

11:57.716 --> 11:59.717
What? Oh, my God,
I've never heard that.

11:59.718 --> 12:02.262
"Mickey D's."
That is just great.

12:02.263 --> 12:04.431
Anyway, let's start looking
for my Big Wheel.

12:04.432 --> 12:07.058
Hey, check it out,
a VCR just sitting here.

12:07.059 --> 12:09.102
I'm taking this sucker home.

12:15.443 --> 12:16.443
Oh, crap.

12:16.444 --> 12:17.861
Brian, you idiot.

12:17.862 --> 12:19.779
Now how the hell are we supposed
to get back to land?

12:19.780 --> 12:21.448
We're both going to die.

12:21.449 --> 12:24.492
Oh, look, a message in a bottle
is washing up.

12:24.493 --> 12:26.829
Maybe this'll help.

12:27.872 --> 12:29.956
Dear England: Enclosed,

12:29.957 --> 12:33.501
please find one bottle fart
in exchange for Russell Brand.

12:33.502 --> 12:35.879
We feel this is
appropriate compensation.

12:35.880 --> 12:38.131
Yours, et cetera, America.

12:47.892 --> 12:49.893
Damn it, Brian!
How could you sink our boat?

12:49.894 --> 12:51.227
We're going to die!

12:51.228 --> 12:52.645
You guys need any help?

12:52.646 --> 12:54.856
- Aah!
- Aah! Who the hell are you?

12:54.857 --> 12:56.316
Name's Taylor. 'Sup?

12:56.317 --> 12:57.650
How the hell did you get here?

12:57.651 --> 12:58.651
Oh, I, uh...

12:58.652 --> 13:00.528
I-I fell off a booze cruise.

13:00.529 --> 13:03.031
- You what?
- Yep, washed up here.

13:03.032 --> 13:05.159
Matter of fact, we all did.

13:08.204 --> 13:10.497
How are you all planning
to get back home?

13:10.498 --> 13:12.874
Get back home?
Why would we want to do that?

13:12.875 --> 13:15.627
Yeah, we've got everything
we need here.

13:15.628 --> 13:18.713
There's tons of free,
half-eaten food that washes up.

13:18.714 --> 13:21.341
And we just bang each other
all day.

13:21.342 --> 13:22.967
That, uh...

13:22.968 --> 13:25.178
that doesn't sound terrible.

13:25.179 --> 13:27.931
Hey, so, we've been stuck
out here for over 20 years.

13:27.932 --> 13:29.724
Can you catch us up
on all the important things

13:29.725 --> 13:30.893
that we've missed?

13:36.398 --> 13:37.690
So, no way!

13:37.691 --> 13:40.026
Kylie Jenner and Tyga
are no longer together?

13:40.027 --> 13:41.528
Splitsville, my friend.

13:41.529 --> 13:43.821
How did Robert Kardashian die?

13:43.822 --> 13:44.822
Guilt cancer.

13:44.823 --> 13:45.949
From what?

13:45.950 --> 13:47.493
Oh, boy.

13:52.373 --> 13:55.291
So people thought the dancing
Judge Itos were funny?

13:55.292 --> 13:56.334
For a while, yes.

13:56.335 --> 13:57.877
Is Leno still doing it?

13:57.878 --> 13:59.462
No, he's not hosting anymore.

13:59.463 --> 14:01.631
Oh, so Conan got
The Tonight Show?

14:01.632 --> 14:03.259
Oh, come o...

14:08.681 --> 14:10.890
A-And so what about
Craig Kilborn? Is he still on?

14:10.891 --> 14:12.225
I'm actually right here.

14:12.226 --> 14:14.603
Oh, right. Hey, Craig.

Oh, hi, Glenn.

14:22.111 --> 14:23.695

14:23.696 --> 14:25.154
H-How are things with Monica?

14:25.155 --> 14:26.447
Who?

14:26.448 --> 14:29.200
Monica, y-your hot date
from the other night.

14:29.201 --> 14:30.785
Oh, yeah. I plowed her.
Thanks again.

14:30.786 --> 14:32.954
But-but I thought
she was the one.

14:32.955 --> 14:34.205
Yeah, no, what I realized is

14:34.206 --> 14:35.707
that all those texts
you sent me,

14:35.708 --> 14:37.125

I believe the Big Wheel

I don't know, Mr. Escher.

16:33.033 --> 16:34.534
That feels great!

16:34.535 --> 16:37.203
Glenn Quagmire, I tried
to help you meet a nice woman,

16:37.204 --> 16:39.414
but you just couldn't help
yourself, could you?

16:39.415 --> 16:40.748
What are you talking about?

16:40.749 --> 16:42.667
I thought
I was helping you find love,

16:42.668 --> 16:44.585
and, instead,
you used me as a tool

16:44.586 --> 16:47.422
to get down every middle-aged
woman's pants in town.

16:47.423 --> 16:49.257
Slacks, Lois.
They call them slacks.

16:49.258 --> 16:51.884
You wouldn't know that
if it wasn't for me!

16:51.885 --> 16:53.428
You're right.

16:53.429 --> 16:56.139
You were kind to me,
and I took advantage of it.

16:56.140 --> 16:58.307
I owe you an apology.

16:58.308 --> 17:00.393
Well, thank you.

17:00.394 --> 17:01.769
Here, let me make it up to you.

17:01.770 --> 17:03.896
I'll buy you a coffee, and...

17:03.897 --> 17:05.982
do you like the music of Ray...

17:05.983 --> 17:07.316
"LaMountain"?

17:07.317 --> 17:08.651
"LaMontagne."

17:08.652 --> 17:10.486
Thank you.
Hey, beautiful,

17:10.487 --> 17:12.655
you want to take
a pointless girl-stride walk

17:12.656 --> 17:14.699
and listen to Ray LaMontagne?

17:14.700 --> 17:16.159
- Sure.
- Great.

17:16.160 --> 17:18.244
See ya, Lois.

17:21.205 --> 17:22.540
Last chance, Brian.

17:22.540 --> 17:24.709
You're really not coming
with me?

I'm sorry, Stewie.
I'm not.

17:26.252 --> 17:27.920
I know it's weird to say, but...

17:27.921 --> 17:30.423
it's kind of just too perfect
for me here.

17:30.424 --> 17:31.591
I see.

17:31.592 --> 17:33.092
Well, I should go.
