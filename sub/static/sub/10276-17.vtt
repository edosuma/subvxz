( muttering )

01:10.770 --> 01:13.839
- Hi, Clover!
- ( shrieks )

01:13.841 --> 01:16.108
Wanna play fetch?

01:17.510 --> 01:20.212
Rex, come on, man.

01:20.214 --> 01:22.381
I'm trying to nap here.

01:22.383 --> 01:23.715
Eww!

01:23.717 --> 01:25.050
So, no?

01:25.052 --> 01:26.552
- Yes.
- Yes?!

01:26.554 --> 01:29.021
No. I meant no
to the yes.

01:29.023 --> 01:31.857
Okay. I'll come
back later.

01:31.859 --> 01:34.626
Perfectly good nap
ruined.

01:34.628 --> 01:36.695
Guess I'll have
a snack.

01:39.966 --> 01:43.035
Ugh! Ew!
These are sour.

01:43.037 --> 01:46.538
Great. Maybe I should
just go back to sleep.

01:50.877 --> 01:52.377
Clover, are you okay?

01:52.379 --> 01:54.046
No.

01:54.048 --> 01:56.815
My nap got interrupted
by a slobbering dog,

01:56.817 --> 01:58.817
and my blueberries
are sour,

01:58.819 --> 02:02.054
and my napping pillow
split down the middle.

02:02.056 --> 02:05.924
Aw. Is my little bunny
having a bad day?

02:05.926 --> 02:07.726
Yes. Yes, I am.

02:07.728 --> 02:09.828
Aw. How can I cheer you up?

02:09.830 --> 02:11.763
Maybe a hug?

02:11.765 --> 02:13.398
You know I'm
not a hugger.

02:13.400 --> 02:15.334
Game of hopscotch?
You always win.

02:15.336 --> 02:17.002
That's 'cause
I'm a bunny.

02:17.004 --> 02:18.837
I know.

02:18.839 --> 02:21.006
Let's get you
a new napping pillow.

02:21.008 --> 02:23.575
Hey, now you're talkin'!

02:23.577 --> 02:25.177
Thanks, Sof.

02:37.323 --> 02:40.025
Hm. I think my tail
fell asleep.

02:40.027 --> 02:41.994
Why did we have
to drive so far?

02:41.996 --> 02:44.496
To get to the best
pillow shop in Enchancia.

02:44.498 --> 02:48.200
Oh, hop! I could really do
some great napping in there.

02:48.202 --> 02:50.502
Wait, Clover.

02:50.504 --> 02:52.704
No pets allowed.
Sorry.

02:54.040 --> 02:56.508
No pets allowed.

02:56.510 --> 02:58.177
This is really
not my day.

02:58.179 --> 03:00.479
Don't worry. Just point
to whatever pillow you want,

03:00.481 --> 03:02.681
and I'll get it.

03:02.683 --> 03:04.883
Okay, there we go.
That one.

03:04.885 --> 03:07.853
Gigantic, blue,
with tassels for chewin'.

03:07.855 --> 03:09.988
Oh, come on.

03:09.990 --> 03:11.857
- You got it.
- Yeah!

03:11.859 --> 03:14.526
( door bell jingles )

03:14.528 --> 03:16.461
See you in a minute.

03:23.670 --> 03:26.738
Oh! First a new pillow,
now a snack.

03:26.740 --> 03:30.108
Ha! This day may finally
be turning around.

03:31.511 --> 03:33.712
( sniffs )
Ah, phew!

03:33.714 --> 03:35.514
That stinks.
Whoa!

03:35.516 --> 03:37.683
Some of it's
not rotten.

03:37.685 --> 03:39.084
Didn't mean to
scare you, buddy.

03:39.086 --> 03:40.852
You look
familiar, man.

03:40.854 --> 03:43.555
You look
just like me.

03:43.557 --> 03:45.224
That's what it is.

03:45.226 --> 03:47.526
You are one
handsome rabbit,

03:47.528 --> 03:49.528
but, oh, uh...

03:49.530 --> 03:51.230
you could use a bath.

03:51.232 --> 03:53.899
( laughs )
Yeah, yeah.
What's a bath?

03:53.901 --> 03:56.068
It's when someone
washes you with water,

03:56.070 --> 03:58.203
and maybe a little
tear-free soap.

03:58.205 --> 04:00.339
- Someone washes you?
- Yeah. Duh.

04:00.341 --> 04:02.441
What kind of place
do you live in?

04:02.443 --> 04:05.377
- A castle.
- Oh, my goose!

04:05.379 --> 04:06.712
Oh, my goose,
oh, my goose!

04:06.714 --> 04:09.848
You live in a castle?!
Oh, my goose!

04:09.850 --> 04:12.584
Are you okay,
whatever your name is?

04:12.586 --> 04:15.787
Barley. I'm
( sings fanfare ) Barley!

04:15.789 --> 04:18.457
Well, Barley,
I ( sings fanfare )

04:18.459 --> 04:21.760
am Clover.
Good to meet you.

04:21.762 --> 04:24.930
Whoo, your life
must be fantastic.

04:24.932 --> 04:26.865
And so fancy.

04:26.867 --> 04:28.533
Not today, it isn't.

04:28.535 --> 04:30.235
Why not?

04:30.237 --> 04:32.037
My nap got interrupted,

04:32.039 --> 04:33.372
they gave me
sour blueberries,

04:33.374 --> 04:35.407
Wait, wait, wait.
You get fed?

04:35.409 --> 04:37.909
Excuse me a sec,
Barley, will ya?

04:37.911 --> 04:39.878
I'm just gonna make sure
my princess is picking up

04:39.880 --> 04:41.480
the right pillow.

04:41.482 --> 04:43.548
You have a pillow?!

04:45.151 --> 04:48.387
I'll be right back.

04:48.389 --> 04:50.222
Where is she?

04:50.224 --> 04:52.557
I can't see.

04:54.127 --> 04:56.495
( sniffs )

04:56.497 --> 04:58.130
Ah, there you are.

04:58.132 --> 04:59.898
Time to go home, Clover.

04:59.900 --> 05:01.566
Princess Sofia
is waiting.

05:01.568 --> 05:03.302
Wait! He's not Clover.

05:03.304 --> 05:05.037
I'm Clover!

05:07.340 --> 05:09.474
Wait. Wait!

05:12.679 --> 05:13.945
( yelling )

05:13.947 --> 05:16.548
Hey!

05:18.484 --> 05:20.319
Wait. Wait.

05:20.321 --> 05:21.753
Here I come.

05:21.755 --> 05:24.790
No, wait!
Come back!

05:24.792 --> 05:28.694
You've got
the wrong bunny!

05:30.496 --> 05:32.497
So, what do you
think, Clover?

05:32.499 --> 05:35.367
( stammering )

05:35.369 --> 05:37.269
This is the one
you asked for, right?

05:37.271 --> 05:38.937
Uh...

05:38.939 --> 05:42.341
Pillow. Princess.
Blueberries.

05:42.343 --> 05:44.710
Oh, my goose.

05:44.712 --> 05:46.845
I just landed in
the fancy life!

05:46.847 --> 05:48.613
( laughing )

05:48.615 --> 05:50.282
The fancy life?
What do you mean?

05:50.284 --> 05:53.185
Wait! You can
understand me?

05:53.187 --> 05:55.520
Of course I can
understand you, silly,

05:55.522 --> 05:57.689
and why are you
talking like that

05:57.691 --> 05:59.324
( stammering )

05:59.326 --> 06:01.259
- ( giggles )
- CLOVER: Come back!

06:02.195 --> 06:04.396
Come back!

06:04.398 --> 06:06.164
The truth is, uh...

06:06.166 --> 06:09.201
( sighs )

06:09.203 --> 06:11.536
I was munchin' on
some scraps outside,

06:11.538 --> 06:13.538
and something got caught
in my throat,

06:13.540 --> 06:16.641
but, oh, hop,
I'm great.

06:19.512 --> 06:21.513
( sniffs )
What's that smell?

06:21.515 --> 06:25.217
Some of those scraps
might've been... garbage.

06:25.219 --> 06:26.985
( nervous chuckle )

06:26.987 --> 06:29.421
Well, don't worry.
We'll get you a bath.

06:29.423 --> 06:31.223
A bath. I heard
about those.

06:33.259 --> 06:35.794
( breathless )
Wait... wait. Hold up.

06:44.103 --> 06:46.004
They must've gone
that way.

06:46.006 --> 06:48.240
Uh, or that way.

06:48.242 --> 06:50.675
Or that way.

06:50.677 --> 06:52.911
( sadly )
Which way did they go?

07:01.354 --> 07:03.255
Huh?

07:03.257 --> 07:05.357
Oh!

07:05.359 --> 07:08.360
I'll go get us some lunch.
Meet me in my room, okay?

07:08.362 --> 07:10.362
Okay... Princess.

07:10.364 --> 07:12.063
( laughs )

07:12.065 --> 07:14.132
Man, she's gonna
get me lunch.

07:14.134 --> 07:16.601
♪ She's gonna
get me lunch ♪

07:16.603 --> 07:18.837
♪ She's... ♪
Wait. Where's her room?

07:22.375 --> 07:24.376
Ah! Dog!

07:24.378 --> 07:25.944
Clover!

07:25.946 --> 07:27.946
A dog, a dog!
He's gonna sniff me.

07:27.948 --> 07:30.582
He'll know I'm not Clover.
Then it's bye-bye fancy life.

07:30.584 --> 07:33.618
( sniffing loudly )

07:33.620 --> 07:35.987
Whoa! Hi, Clover.

07:35.989 --> 07:38.924
Hi... ahem... hi...
you.

07:38.926 --> 07:40.425
You wanna play fetch?

07:40.427 --> 07:42.160
Fetch? Sure.

07:42.162 --> 07:44.930
Really? You never
say yes.

07:44.932 --> 07:46.898
I mean no.
I mean...

07:46.900 --> 07:49.067
Hey, I've got
a better idea.

07:49.069 --> 07:50.502
Yo, let's have a race.

07:50.504 --> 07:53.505
First one to
Sofia's room wins.

07:53.507 --> 07:56.741
I'd love that! Okay!

08:02.181 --> 08:05.150
Oh, berries. That's
a sight for sore eyes.

08:09.288 --> 08:10.989
Help. I'm stuck!

08:10.991 --> 08:12.524
Yo, somebody help me!

08:12.526 --> 08:15.327
Is there a poor,
suffering creature in need?

08:15.329 --> 08:17.829
Yes, poor, suffering
creature in need over here.

08:17.831 --> 08:19.598
Oh, how exciting.

08:19.600 --> 08:21.733
I mean, I'm a-comin'.

08:23.169 --> 08:24.936
Can you... can you
get me outta here?

08:24.938 --> 08:26.438
Yes, can do.

08:29.675 --> 08:31.142
Thank you.

08:31.144 --> 08:32.878
Um, I'm
( sings fanfare ) Clover.

08:32.880 --> 08:34.179
Sassafras.

08:34.181 --> 08:35.814
Trailblazer, star gazer,

08:35.816 --> 08:38.149
and champion to
those in need.

08:38.151 --> 08:39.951
Really? Oh!

08:39.953 --> 08:41.987
Because I'm trying
to get back to my castle,

08:41.989 --> 08:43.788
- but I think I'm lost.
- That's great!

08:43.790 --> 08:45.290
It is?

08:45.292 --> 08:48.860
Yes. You're lost,
hungry, and far
from home.

08:48.862 --> 08:51.830
It's like I hit
the helpin' jackpot.

08:51.832 --> 08:53.999
First, better eat
some bristle berries.

08:54.001 --> 08:55.834
We got a long hike
ahead of us,

08:55.836 --> 08:57.669
and you're gonna need
all the energy you can get.

08:57.671 --> 09:00.171
Oh, thank you.
( chewing loudly )

09:00.173 --> 09:02.240
These taste like dirt.

09:02.242 --> 09:04.509
I know.
Aren't they yums?

09:04.511 --> 09:07.212
Don't you have any,
uh, blueberries

09:07.214 --> 09:09.247
or raspberries?

09:09.249 --> 09:11.816
Nope. No sirree.
Not out here in
the wilderness.

09:11.818 --> 09:13.418
Now follow me.
I know a shortcut

09:13.420 --> 09:15.487
straight to
the castle.

09:17.089 --> 09:18.990
Princess Sofia's room!

09:18.992 --> 09:20.625
I win!
( laughs )

09:24.897 --> 09:26.498
You sure did.

09:26.500 --> 09:29.167
You're way too fast
for me.

09:29.169 --> 09:30.702
( laughs )
Okay. See ya later, pal.

09:30.704 --> 09:32.470
( howling )

09:35.675 --> 09:39.878
Hey. So how's this spot
for your new napping pillow?

09:39.880 --> 09:42.447
What? This is where
I nap?

09:42.449 --> 09:44.082
This is... this is...

09:44.084 --> 09:46.685
Aw, come on.
This is my...

09:46.687 --> 09:48.119
I mean... oh!
And do I love it?!

09:48.121 --> 09:49.854
( laughs )
Princess.

09:49.856 --> 09:52.524
( awkward chuckle )
I'm glad to hear that, Clover.

09:52.526 --> 09:55.026
So then, I'll
leave it there.

09:55.028 --> 09:56.761
And here's your lunch.

09:56.763 --> 09:58.263
That's for me?

09:58.265 --> 10:00.765
( excited laughter )

10:00.767 --> 10:02.701
Oh, thank you, thank you,
thank you, thank you!

10:02.703 --> 10:04.035
You're welcome.

10:04.037 --> 10:06.438
Um, what happened
to your ear?

10:06.440 --> 10:08.373
Nothin'.

10:08.375 --> 10:10.642
I'm just a, uh...

10:13.813 --> 10:15.246
Ouch.

10:15.248 --> 10:18.083
What's the hold-up, bunny?

10:18.085 --> 10:20.085
Looks like there might be
a storm a-blowin' in,

10:20.087 --> 10:22.320
and your castle
is still a ways off.

10:22.322 --> 10:24.823
These rocks
are like spikes.

10:24.825 --> 10:26.658
They're jabbing
into my paws.

10:26.660 --> 10:28.326
Let me see
those paws.

10:28.328 --> 10:31.396
( laughs )
Hey, no wonder
the rocks hurt.

10:31.398 --> 10:34.399
These are the softest
paws I've ever seen.

10:34.401 --> 10:35.500
What do you do all day?

10:35.502 --> 10:37.669
Sleep, eat,
eat some more,

10:37.671 --> 10:39.504
maybe I play a game
with my princess,

10:39.506 --> 10:41.506
then sleep a little
more after that.

10:41.508 --> 10:44.743
Whoo hoo whee!
You have your own princess?!

10:44.745 --> 10:46.411
That sounds
awful nice.

10:46.413 --> 10:47.746
I have a trick for ya.

10:47.748 --> 10:49.180
We'll put these
mushroom tops

10:49.182 --> 10:51.249
around those
soft paws.

10:51.251 --> 10:52.884
It's nature's
padding.

10:54.954 --> 10:56.454
( loud chewing )

10:56.456 --> 10:58.623
This is delicious.

10:58.625 --> 11:02.627
Heavenly! And not one
piece of it is rotten.

11:02.629 --> 11:05.697
Clover, you really are
acting strange.

11:05.699 --> 11:07.999
Are you sure there's not
something wrong?

11:08.001 --> 11:09.868
I was just
really hungry.

11:09.870 --> 11:11.836
But I'm great.

11:11.838 --> 11:13.505
Um, okay.

11:13.507 --> 11:15.674
Well, I'm going
to fencing practice.

11:15.676 --> 11:16.875
I'll see you later.

11:16.877 --> 11:18.343
You sure will,

11:18.345 --> 11:23.014
because I wanna stay
here forever and ever...

- ( thunder crashing )

13:21.768 --> 13:24.269
And now it is.

13:24.271 --> 13:26.337
( inhales deeply )
Ah!

13:26.339 --> 13:29.507
It's all part of
the great outdoors.

13:29.509 --> 13:32.510
Yeah. Is there any indoor
area in all this outdoors

13:32.512 --> 13:35.346
that we could maybe
hide out in for a while?

13:35.348 --> 13:37.315
My place isn't
too far from here.

13:37.317 --> 13:39.951
We can wait out
the storm there
if you want,

13:39.953 --> 13:43.688
and you'll be happy to hear,
it is a nice, soft path
all the way.

13:45.090 --> 13:47.692
The path is soft because
it's all muddy, isn't it?

13:47.694 --> 13:50.862
Yep, but it's only neck-deep,
so we'll be fine.

13:50.864 --> 13:53.865
Mmm... that does not
sound fine.

14:00.139 --> 14:01.539
That's strange.

14:01.541 --> 14:03.508
Clover never plays
with Rex.

14:03.510 --> 14:05.310
You know what?

14:05.312 --> 14:08.613
You are, like, way more fun
than usual today, Clover.

14:08.615 --> 14:10.048
( laughs )
Well, uh,

14:10.050 --> 14:13.284
don't tell anyone,
but I'm not Clover.

14:13.286 --> 14:15.186
( laughing )

14:15.188 --> 14:18.022
Okay...<i> Clover. </i>
I won't tell anyone.

14:18.024 --> 14:20.792
Hi, guys.
Having a good time?

14:20.794 --> 14:24.062
Oh, yeah.
The best time
of my life.

14:24.064 --> 14:27.565
But, Clover, I thought
you didn't like playing
fetch with Rex.

14:27.567 --> 14:29.500
I didn't.

14:29.502 --> 14:30.969
I mean, I don't.

14:30.971 --> 14:32.670
This is a one-time thing,
ya know?

14:32.672 --> 14:34.005
Hmm. So...

14:34.007 --> 14:35.974
do you want a snack?

14:35.976 --> 14:38.509
Nah, that's all right.
I'm still full from lunch.

14:38.511 --> 14:39.911
Okay, that's it.

14:39.913 --> 14:41.579
You never play fetch
with Rex,

14:41.581 --> 14:42.914
your voice sounds funny,

14:42.916 --> 14:45.917
and you are
never, ever full.

14:45.919 --> 14:48.753
You are not Clover,
are you?

14:48.755 --> 14:51.256
Okay, okay,
you're right.

14:51.258 --> 14:55.093
- I am not Clover.
- Who are you then?

14:55.095 --> 14:58.329
My name's ( singing
fanfare ) Barley.

14:58.331 --> 15:00.231
Your coachman picked me up
in the village

15:00.233 --> 15:02.433
because he thought
I was Clover.

15:02.435 --> 15:04.302
I didn't wanna tell you because
castle life is so amazing,

15:04.304 --> 15:06.037
and I just wanted to stay.

15:06.039 --> 15:09.240
So Clover's still
in the village by himself?

15:09.242 --> 15:10.742
I'm so sorry.

15:10.744 --> 15:12.443
I didn't mean
to cause any harm.

15:12.445 --> 15:13.878
I'll help you
find him, okay?

15:13.880 --> 15:15.947
Okay. We need to go
right away.

15:15.949 --> 15:17.882
Hey, we're in the middle
of our game.

15:17.884 --> 15:19.584
Where are you going?

15:19.586 --> 15:22.453
I'm sorry, dog.
We gotta find
the real Clover.

15:22.455 --> 15:25.123
Oh! Okay, Clover.

15:25.125 --> 15:27.125
( thunder crashing )

15:35.200 --> 15:36.768
Here we are.

15:36.770 --> 15:39.203
Home sweet tree.

15:41.206 --> 15:44.108
Uh, where's the part
where you

15:44.110 --> 15:45.777
actually live?

15:45.779 --> 15:47.578
Right here.

15:47.580 --> 15:50.248
You can relax on
this big chair.

15:50.250 --> 15:52.450
It's super comfy
as hunks of wood go.

15:52.452 --> 15:53.918
Or take the exercise ball.

15:53.920 --> 15:55.753
You could just
sit on it like this,

15:55.755 --> 15:58.489
or you could stretch over it,
or do arm dips.

15:58.491 --> 16:00.258
And if you feel like a nap,
and you seem like

16:00.260 --> 16:01.759
the type who does,

16:01.761 --> 16:04.162
you can take a quick snooze
over here.

16:04.164 --> 16:06.798
It's a back scratcher
and bed all in one.

16:06.800 --> 16:09.567
So you like living here.

16:09.569 --> 16:12.236
Of course.
It's pretty swell, huh?

16:12.238 --> 16:13.638
( sighs happily )

16:13.640 --> 16:17.075
Yep, I am one lucky
marsupial.

16:17.077 --> 16:19.777
You know, I live in
a huge castle,

16:19.779 --> 16:22.013
nap on a big,
soft pillow,

16:22.015 --> 16:24.015
snack on fresh blueberries.

16:24.017 --> 16:27.418
I even have a princess
who scratches my ears,

16:27.420 --> 16:28.920
plays with me,
and cheers me up

16:28.922 --> 16:30.822
when I'm having
a bad day,

16:30.824 --> 16:33.124
even if it's not
really that bad a day.

16:33.126 --> 16:36.094
I never realized
how lucky I am.

16:36.096 --> 16:38.963
Well, sometimes,
you're not truly thankful

16:38.965 --> 16:40.765
for what you got
until you lose it.

16:40.767 --> 16:42.600
Let me demonstrate.

16:42.602 --> 16:45.169
- You see?
- You're right.

16:45.171 --> 16:48.439
And I am going to be
thankful for all
the things I have

16:48.441 --> 16:50.274
in my life,

16:50.276 --> 16:51.976
as soon as
I get back home.

16:51.978 --> 16:54.012
Then what are
we waitin' for?

16:54.014 --> 16:55.279
Let's get
back out there.

16:55.281 --> 16:57.448
But it's still
raining.

16:57.450 --> 16:59.450
Oh, you're not gonna
let a little rain

16:59.452 --> 17:02.286
keep you from gettin'
back to your castle, are you?

17:02.288 --> 17:05.323
No way, Sassafras.

17:05.325 --> 17:07.291
I am going home.

17:07.293 --> 17:09.927
And I'm a-gonna
get you there, bunny.

17:17.336 --> 17:19.237
( horse whinnying )

17:43.762 --> 17:46.164
Is everyone all right
back there?

17:46.166 --> 17:47.665
We're okay.

17:47.667 --> 17:50.668
Good. I'm afraid
we lost a wheel, miss.

17:50.670 --> 17:52.270
Poor Clover.

17:52.272 --> 17:54.338
I hope he's somewhere
safe and warm.

18:20.532 --> 18:22.600
There it is.
There it is!

18:22.602 --> 18:24.135
I'm almost home!

18:35.948 --> 18:38.616
This way, Sassafras.

18:42.955 --> 18:44.388
( laughing )
Yes!

18:44.390 --> 18:46.824
Whoo, I'm back, baby!

18:46.826 --> 18:50.895
I am never going out
into the wilderness again.

18:54.833 --> 18:58.002
So this is your
place, huh? Hm.

18:58.004 --> 19:00.605
This is my
Princess Sofia's room.

19:00.607 --> 19:02.507
I hang out here a lot.

19:02.509 --> 19:04.976
Oh, this is where
Sofia and I have lunch.

19:04.978 --> 19:06.911
This is where
we play hopscotch.

19:06.913 --> 19:08.813
Oh, and this is where
she lets me chew

19:08.815 --> 19:10.615
all the shoes I want.

19:10.617 --> 19:14.485
Oh... ( chewing loudly )

19:14.487 --> 19:16.354
And that's...

19:16.356 --> 19:18.990
That is the new napping
pillow Sofia got me.

19:18.992 --> 19:21.025
( giggling )

19:21.027 --> 19:22.593
Wait. Sofia?

19:22.595 --> 19:24.362
Where's Sofia?

19:24.364 --> 19:26.764
Hey, Sof. Sof.

19:26.766 --> 19:28.099
Clover!

19:28.101 --> 19:29.934
You're back already.

19:29.936 --> 19:31.702
What do you mean already?

19:31.704 --> 19:33.337
I feel like I've
been gone for ages.

19:33.339 --> 19:34.539
Where's Sofia?

19:34.541 --> 19:36.674
Oh, she went out
to look for you.

19:36.676 --> 19:38.809
( panting )
With you.

19:38.811 --> 19:40.511
With me?
What...

19:40.513 --> 19:41.846
She went
out there,

19:41.848 --> 19:43.347
in the storm?

19:43.349 --> 19:45.016
Come on. We gotta
find my princess.

19:45.018 --> 19:46.684
She could get
hurt out there.

19:46.686 --> 19:48.386
I don't understand.

19:48.388 --> 19:50.288
You wanna go
back outside?

19:50.290 --> 19:52.290
But you're finally
in your castle,

19:52.292 --> 19:54.659
with its fancy walls
and floors,

19:54.661 --> 19:55.826
and things to chew.

19:55.828 --> 19:57.628
I know, I know,

19:57.630 --> 19:59.830
but none of these things
seem all that great

19:59.832 --> 20:02.400
without Sofia.
She gave me all this.

20:02.402 --> 20:04.635
She gave me
this good life,

20:04.637 --> 20:06.737
and she's the best
part of it.

20:06.739 --> 20:09.740
So I'm goin'
back out there, Sassafras.

20:09.742 --> 20:12.410
Run, rabbit, run.

20:12.412 --> 20:15.913
Hey, why do all the Clovers
keep leaving me behind?

20:15.915 --> 20:17.648
Wait up!

20:18.917 --> 20:20.918
Look, look.

20:20.920 --> 20:22.887
They must've gone
that way.

20:25.424 --> 20:27.158
A coach.

20:27.160 --> 20:29.927
Oh, no.
What happened to her?

20:29.929 --> 20:32.096
What if she's hurt,

20:32.098 --> 20:34.665
and wandering through
the woods all alone?

20:34.667 --> 20:38.536
What if she got stuck
in a bramble bush,

20:38.538 --> 20:41.706
or eaten by
a wild beast?

20:41.708 --> 20:43.708
- Oh...
- Clover?

20:43.710 --> 20:45.209
Sofia?

20:45.211 --> 20:48.412
Oh, it's me! It's me!
The real me!

20:48.414 --> 20:50.248
I'm so glad
you're okay.

20:50.250 --> 20:52.416
I was afraid I'd
never see you again.

20:52.418 --> 20:54.919
Hey, are you sure
it's the real you?

20:54.921 --> 20:57.421
I thought you weren't
a hugger.

20:57.423 --> 20:59.490
Well, I am now.

21:01.026 --> 21:02.260
You!

21:02.262 --> 21:05.029
Oh, hey.
( nervous laughter )

21:05.031 --> 21:08.366
Sorry I tried
to live your life
and all,

21:08.368 --> 21:11.102
but it was just
such a nice, cozy life,

21:11.104 --> 21:13.204
compared to mine.

21:13.206 --> 21:15.239
( frustrated groan )
Ah!

21:15.241 --> 21:17.775
I can't blame you, Barley.

21:17.777 --> 21:19.410
I do have a great life.

21:19.412 --> 21:21.612
( giggles )
All thanks to you, Sof.

21:22.881 --> 21:26.484
Does this mean you are now
a poor, helpless creature

21:26.486 --> 21:28.085
in need of a home?

21:28.087 --> 21:30.221
Well, I guess I am.

21:30.223 --> 21:32.323
<i> Enchante.</i>
And you are?

21:32.325 --> 21:34.659
This is
Sassafras.

21:34.661 --> 21:36.494
I couldn't have
found my way home
without her.

21:36.496 --> 21:38.496
You know, Barley,
I happen to have

21:38.498 --> 21:40.631
a nice, cozy
hollowed-out tree

21:40.633 --> 21:43.334
- with plenty of
extra space.
- You do?

21:43.336 --> 21:46.904
And enough bristle berries
to whip up a whole pie.

21:46.906 --> 21:49.407
Oh, I love
bristle berries!

21:49.409 --> 21:52.009
( laughs )
They're definitely
made for each other.

21:52.011 --> 21:54.011
( sighs )
Well, Princess,

21:54.013 --> 21:56.180
the coach is
all fixed up
and ready to go.

21:56.182 --> 21:57.481
Okay, great.

21:57.483 --> 21:59.917
I guess it's
so long for now.

21:59.919 --> 22:01.585
Thanks for everything,
Sass.

22:01.587 --> 22:03.154
Any time, friends.

22:03.156 --> 22:05.523
And Princess,
I had a great day.

22:05.525 --> 22:07.591
I did, too.
Good luck, Barley.

22:09.761 --> 22:12.330
