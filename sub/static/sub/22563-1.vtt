It's been a terrible war, right enough.

02:48.168 --> 02:51.456
No more whisky! Ah!

04:07.998 --> 04:10.365
I can only think he has not so far

04:10.500 --> 04:14.539
because his cabinet have advised him
to avoid panic in the streets.

04:14.671 --> 04:16.958
It is like a curse from God himself.

04:17.089 --> 04:23.587

of the bell calling all souls to repent

(Girl) Is it true about the whisky, sir?

04:58.548 --> 05:00.414
Bang, bang!

05:06.640 --> 05:12.352
To think I should be hearing
from other persons that my own son,

05:12.479 --> 05:16.393
my very own son,
has proposed marriage!

05:17.484 --> 05:20.818
Why was I kept in the dark
about your deviant thoughts?

05:22.197 --> 05:24.529
What would have been the use
in upsetting you?

05:24.658 --> 05:26.274
So you knew it would upset me?

05:26.409 --> 05:30.698
You knew it and yet you charged on
all the same, thinking only of yourself.

05:31.790 --> 05:34.373
You've always only ever thought
of yourself.

05:35.126 --> 05:39.040
I have. I have.
I've been... I've been very selfish.

05:40.006 --> 05:45.752
But mother if, if I do bring Catriona to tea,
will you please be nice to her?

05:45.887 --> 05:50.677

It's not in a widowed man
to bring up girls.

06:05.490 --> 06:09.108
Aye, well, daughters are a handful,
right enough.

06:10.495 --> 06:13.032
Aye. Smoke away girls, smoke away.

Hey? To hell with poverty!

I'll manage fine.

Here, in the wide Atlantic ocean,

06:23.967 --> 06:26.959
sit the lovely Scottish islands
of the Outer Hebrides.

06:27.095 --> 06:30.338
A hundred miles to the east
lies the mainland,

06:30.473 --> 06:34.888
and to the west of us,
there is nothing except America.

(Woman) You wonder what a beauty of
a man like that sees in the likes of her

06:47.532 --> 06:49.819
that he would throw away
the chance to be king.

like a draw-string purse too.

- They have a friend, Mr Hitler, in common.

If I'm not good enough
to come to tea at your house

07:29.407 --> 07:32.570
then I'm not good enough to marry you.

07:32.702 --> 07:36.240
Well you see, Catriona,
it came as a bit of a shock to her.

07:37.457 --> 07:39.039
Mother would think the same
about any girl.

07:39.167 --> 07:42.956
Any girl?
Well if I'm just "any girl" to you,

07:43.088 --> 07:45.546

(Catriona) Your sergeant will wonder
where you are, Peggy.

08:06.111 --> 08:10.446
- I suppose it is normal to feel afraid.
- Afraid?

08:12.075 --> 08:13.531
I'm not.

08:15.328 --> 08:17.069
Good luck, sister.

Captain, there were times when it was bad.

08:47.652 --> 08:49.984
It was only the thought
of this little island

08:50.113 --> 08:52.400
and my Peggy that kept the spirit up.

08:53.575 --> 08:56.112
And I believe you are to whip
the Home Guard ship-shape.

08:57.412 --> 09:00.154
You can start with the man in charge.

09:00.290 --> 09:03.078

thinks he is Montgomery.

09:15.555 --> 09:17.671
(Captain) Their quota's been cancelled.

09:17.807 --> 09:19.548
Tell them there is no more whisky.

09:25.648 --> 09:26.979
No.

10:01.309 --> 10:03.095
Captain Waggett!

10:04.229 --> 10:07.813
Captain McKechnie, as you well know,
it is my duty to make sure this island

10:07.941 --> 10:10.399
is at a full state of defence
and readiness at all times.

10:11.236 --> 10:15.070
How can I defend this island
when my cartridges do not fit my rifles?

10:15.198 --> 10:18.156
Aye, that would be awkward for you,
right enough.

10:18.284 --> 10:21.197
(Waggett) It's this kind of slapdashery
that ended up with the fall of France.

10:21.329 --> 10:24.287
I now hear from Ordinance
I cannot get my .303 ammunition

10:24.415 --> 10:27.032
until you take back this case of .300!

10:27.168 --> 10:29.284
Ah, Captain, sorry I am,

10:29.420 --> 10:32.208
- but that I cannot do.
- Why the hell not, man?

10:32.340 --> 10:35.708
Had I known that ammunition
was actual explosives,

10:35.844 --> 10:39.087
I would never have brought the boxes
of 300s in the first place.

10:41.224 --> 10:43.591
- Can I be of any help, sir?
- Sergeant Odd, welcome back.

10:43.726 --> 10:46.093
Er, no, thank you.
I have got this completely under control.

10:46.229 --> 10:50.439
How would it do for you, Captain Waggett,
if I took back your 303 rifles

10:50.567 --> 10:53.025
and you kept the 300 ammunition?

10:53.153 --> 10:56.487
Then you could ask Ordinance
to send you the 300 rifles,

10:56.614 --> 10:58.776
- so that you could use them together.
- Not at all, man.

10:58.908 --> 11:02.071
I'd rather have rifles and no ammunition
than ammunition and no rifles.

11:02.203 --> 11:03.864
God!

11:03.997 --> 11:07.615
Can this man be as stupid as he appears
to be? He drives a large boat after all.

11:07.750 --> 11:11.584
I think it's just a bit of banter, sir,
in an islander sort of way. A bit of fun.

11:12.422 --> 11:14.789
Really? I wonder what it is
he finds so amusing. Hey, you!

11:14.924 --> 11:16.961
Street mutt, no, no. Get out of there.

11:17.093 --> 11:19.551
Beg pardon, sir.
If I may make a suggestion.

11:19.679 --> 11:22.637
We could leave the ammunition
at Macr00n's post office

11:22.765 --> 11:25.678
and then use the telephone
to take it up with headquarters directly.

11:26.978 --> 11:30.516
- Mr Macroon?
- Aye, Mr Waggett.

11:31.649 --> 11:33.515
Yes, very good. 24-hour guard, mind.

11:33.651 --> 11:34.937
- Of course, sir.
- Around the clock.

11:35.069 --> 11:36.730
- Yes, sir.
- Arrange it.

12:15.360 --> 12:18.352
(Peggy) It's not you.
It's the whisky drought.

12:19.864 --> 12:21.775
(Odd) People used to be so friendly.

12:21.908 --> 12:23.740
(Peggy laughs)

12:25.578 --> 12:27.785
There has spread throughout this island

12:27.914 --> 12:31.248
a contagion of lassitude,
half-heartedness,

12:31.376 --> 12:36.871
and in some extreme cases, I would go
as far as to say unwarranted snarling.

12:37.882 --> 12:40.123
With some men wandering the hills

12:40.260 --> 12:44.049
hallucinating from dehydration
and shouting at the sky.

12:45.640 --> 12:49.850
Aye, Donald,
a drought is a tragedy to behold.

12:50.645 --> 12:52.932
It's hardly an outbreak
of dengue fever, Peggy.

12:53.064 --> 12:55.226
(Chuckles) You're right, Odd.

12:55.358 --> 12:56.974
It's worse.

13:09.789 --> 13:12.827
Identify yourself.
Which one are you, friend or foe?

13:14.168 --> 13:17.706
Father, I've just been out walking
with Sergeant Odd

13:17.839 --> 13:20.627
and thinking, if he and I were to...

13:20.758 --> 13:24.467
Well, we would only be separated
by a wee bit of geography

13:24.595 --> 13:28.054
- Oh, shush now, Peggy.
- He's a bit shy of you.

13:28.933 --> 13:34.019
For as you well know, Father, cats jump
up trees when they see you coming.

13:35.732 --> 13:37.222
(He sighs)

13:46.951 --> 13:49.318
Minister, I was just coming to see you.

13:49.454 --> 13:50.819
Ah!

13:52.081 --> 13:55.870
Return of the conquering hero!
Glad to have you back amongst us.

13:56.002 --> 13:59.836
I've come for your blessing and to ask
your advice about how to approach Macroon.

14:00.715 --> 14:02.581
Well...

14:02.717 --> 14:05.129
Joseph can be slippery, right enough.

14:06.554 --> 14:07.965
Here.

14:13.686 --> 14:15.552
- Nice enough wine.
- Aye. It's the altar wine

14:15.688 --> 14:18.100
from Father O'Neil's chapel
up the street.

14:18.941 --> 14:22.434
- If you don't mind, Minister, I won't.
- No, no. You're quite right.

14:22.570 --> 14:25.983
Be a terrible thing to go through
the North Africa campaign unscathed

14:26.115 --> 14:28.277
then be felled by an Italian grape.

14:28.409 --> 14:30.776
But me, I'm fearless.

14:33.873 --> 14:39.209
Now, you see, Macr00n's just sore
because of an imagined martyred loneliness.

14:39.337 --> 14:42.250
I'll have a word with him
and if you'd like to leave a wee deposit

14:42.382 --> 14:45.545
for the wedding service,
cash will be fine.

14:52.266 --> 14:53.756
Thank you.

15:01.609 --> 15:03.270
Mrs Campbell?

15:07.240 --> 15:09.481
Your George will soon enough
be my George,

15:09.617 --> 15:10.982
and I will not be sharing him.

15:12.161 --> 15:16.155
You will no longer control George
or interfere in anything he does,

15:16.290 --> 15:20.705
or use your sanctimonious Bible-beating
as blackmail to his mild nature.

15:21.504 --> 15:23.370
No more.

15:30.263 --> 15:32.049
(Waggett) Right, now, men.

15:32.181 --> 15:35.390
As you know, Hitler is at this very moment
with his Nazi hordes

15:35.518 --> 15:37.680
just over there in Non/vay.

15:37.812 --> 15:41.521
Imagine if Hitler decides
to invade England

15:41.649 --> 15:44.141
by way of our little island of Todday.

15:44.277 --> 15:49.022
Ergo, we must be able to set up
a roadblock at a moment's notice.

15:49.866 --> 15:52.733
- Carry on, Sergeant.
- All right, men, let's get to it.

15:54.162 --> 15:55.903
Fall out!

16:05.756 --> 16:07.292
One point did strike me, sir.

16:07.425 --> 16:10.884
As this is only a little island
and this the only road around it,

16:11.012 --> 16:15.848
in theory, all Hitler would need to do
would be to turn around at this barricade

16:15.975 --> 16:17.807
and approach from the other side.

16:18.811 --> 16:21.052
Yes, I was wondering
when you were going to notice that.

16:21.189 --> 16:24.181
And I wondered when you were going
to notice that, Corporal.

16:24.317 --> 16:26.354
But I reasonably thought it was
just an exercise, sir.

16:26.486 --> 16:30.229
Well, it's easy enough to put it right, sir.
You just want another one.

16:30.364 --> 16:33.277
Over there, sir.
The, er, other side of the island.

16:35.578 --> 16:37.740
Correct answer.

16:37.872 --> 16:41.206
- Arrange it, Corporal.
- Yes, sir.

16:42.793 --> 16:44.454
(Car horn honking)

16:52.345 --> 16:54.302
What is this insanity?

16:54.430 --> 16:56.512
It is a roadblock, is what it is, Doctor.

16:56.641 --> 17:00.009
- Well, damn well unblock it!
- No, that I cannot do.

17:00.144 --> 17:04.684
You could be the panzer division
invading England by way of Scotland.

17:04.815 --> 17:08.148
Ah, I see, I see.

17:08.903 --> 17:11.234
Waggett! Waggett!

17:12.073 --> 17:16.237
Does this Alvis look like a tank
to you, Waggett?

17:16.368 --> 17:19.236
Have you indeed ever seen a tank, Waggett?

17:19.372 --> 17:21.079
There is a war on, sir.

17:21.207 --> 17:24.575
This is a Home Guard exercise and
every vehicle must be stopped and searched.

17:24.710 --> 17:29.204
Well, I will be most obliged if you'd
kindly make an exception in my case.

17:29.340 --> 17:33.334
I've one more call to make
before I get home to my bed.

17:33.469 --> 17:37.007
I've been up all night
delivering Mrs McKenzie of twins -

17:37.139 --> 17:39.972
without so much as a dram to fortify me.

17:41.477 --> 17:45.687
So, clear this bloody junk
out of my bloody way and let me through!

17:45.815 --> 17:47.180
- Twins?
- Aye.

17:47.316 --> 17:52.231
- And how would you know?
- Two girls, no boy, it's a calamity.

17:52.363 --> 17:56.823
It's a miracle, what with himself away
at sea this past 12 months.

17:56.951 --> 17:58.362
(Waggett) Very well. Open the road!

17:58.494 --> 18:00.405
Let this person through.

18:00.538 --> 18:03.030
(Odd) Right men, once again. Move her.

18:03.916 --> 18:09.127
Dr McLaren, henceforth I shall
mark you down as a conscientious objector.

18:09.255 --> 18:12.373
Sergeant Odd, conscientious objector.

18:12.508 --> 18:16.251
God deliver us from the pompous,
for they know well what they do.

of the whisky drought,

- I've brought you some tobacco.
- Ah, thank you, Doctor

19:03.517 --> 19:08.637
(Sighs) The world has never been
in such a terrible mess since Noah's flood.

19:08.773 --> 19:12.437
(Doctor) We can't have you giving up
smoking as well as the whisky.

19:14.278 --> 19:19.489
(Old Roddy) I would like fine to have just
one more really good dram,

19:19.617 --> 19:23.861
just one more mindless session with it
before I join the wife.

19:23.996 --> 19:28.832
Oh, wisht! You've years of dangerous life
left in you yet.

19:28.959 --> 19:32.168
I wouldn't chance giving you a kick
if you were a fortnight dead,

- Do you hear that, Doctor?
- Aye, a ship out on the Minch.

19:44.392 --> 19:47.305

she'll be fine.

may the Lord make us truly thankful.

20:00.282 --> 20:01.568
Amen.

20:02.702 --> 20:06.070
Ah, you would think, girls, nothing worse
than this drought could happen.

20:06.205 --> 20:11.416
Now, God sends this dense thick fog
to surround and blind our island.

- It shouldn't be.

20:19.093 --> 20:21.084
Miles away if it is.

20:22.054 --> 20:24.421
No ship of mine will go near
the Skerrydoo.

20:32.940 --> 20:37.309
Man the lifeboats.
Every man for himself. Abandon ship.

20:38.237 --> 20:39.693
Aye.

20:41.574 --> 20:42.609
Aye.

20:45.244 --> 20:46.826
Thank you.

20:51.625 --> 20:54.538
- She's done for.
- What about the crew?

20:55.588 --> 20:58.546
I've a mind to go out to her.
The fog isn't so thick now.

20:58.674 --> 21:00.915
- I'll come with you.
- You could meet your deaths out there.

21:01.051 --> 21:04.009
Ach, Biff er knows every sigh
of that dark sea around the Skerrydoo.

21:04.138 --> 21:07.130
Aye, he's related to every rock
and his granny.

21:38.464 --> 21:42.674
- Ahoy there!
- (Biff er) Ahoy!

21:42.802 --> 21:46.921
This is Captain Buncher,
the SS Cabinet Minister.

21:47.765 --> 21:52.555
Thankfully, sir, I've saved my crew,
but the ship, she's a total wreck.

21:52.686 --> 21:54.848
What is your cargo?

21:55.523 --> 22:00.313
(Buncher) Odds and ends of furniture
for the Bahamas and whisky for New York.

22:02.071 --> 22:04.108
50,000 cases.

22:04.949 --> 22:07.862
50,000 cases!

50,000!

22:11.288 --> 22:13.871
12 bottles in every case!

22:15.167 --> 22:20.412
My, my! Glory be to God in the highest,
for He has not forsaken us.

22:22.967 --> 22:24.708
Back to the village with our news, Sammy.

22:24.844 --> 22:26.630
After us, Captain!

22:28.222 --> 22:31.465

23:43.339 --> 23:45.250
Let's go home.

24:01.941 --> 24:04.433
- The Sabbath?
- The Sabbath.

24:04.568 --> 24:07.686
The Sunday.
Nothing can happen on a Sunday.

24:07.821 --> 24:09.983
No work, no play for the children,

24:10.115 --> 24:13.403
swings are locked up
and skipping ropes are evil incarnate.

24:13.535 --> 24:16.778
And to whistle a tune in the street
is to have it whispered behind curtains

24:16.914 --> 24:20.123
that you have "continental ways"
about you.

24:20.250 --> 24:24.039
Just church and prayer
and prayer and church. Nothing else.

- Thanks.

24:41.563 --> 24:44.055
Don't turn the engine on!
Wheel it all the way.

24:44.191 --> 24:47.024
- What, I'd waken the village?
- It's the Sabbath.

24:48.070 --> 24:49.356
Right.

24:50.114 --> 24:51.775
Sabbath. Aye.

24:57.079 --> 25:01.915
(Minister) And the Lord sent them
what they craved, and they drank their fill,

25:02.042 --> 25:07.458
and they were filled with a promise
of things God knew to be iniquitous.

25:08.215 --> 25:10.422
But before their thirst was sated,

25:10.551 --> 25:16.547
and with Satan's drink still in their mouth,
the wrath of God came upon them

25:16.682 --> 25:21.722
and he slew the strongest
and laid low their thirst.

25:26.525 --> 25:31.816
(Sammy) Aye, that was an awful long
service the Minister gave us.

25:31.947 --> 25:34.780
And when he was shouting out
the commandments,

25:34.908 --> 25:39.448
did you notice how his voice quietened
at "thou shalt not steal"?

25:40.372 --> 25:45.867
But "thou shall not commit adultery",
that one was meant for you alone, Sammy.

25:53.594 --> 25:57.087
(Sammy) Cheer up Macroon.
She'll still be there come Monday.

25:57.222 --> 25:58.929
(Macroon sighs)

26:12.738 --> 26:16.481
Good morning, gentlemen, ladies.
It's a grand day, eh?

26:16.617 --> 26:18.699
Could you tell me,
is there a public phone on the island?

26:19.620 --> 26:22.908
From where you stand now,
turn left or right,

26:23.040 --> 26:25.281
and you'll surely come to it.

26:29.004 --> 26:30.620
Ah! Ha!

26:32.424 --> 26:34.131
Much obliged.

26:35.803 --> 26:38.010
Where did that come from?

26:38.138 --> 26:41.256
It has the bearing
of a Captain Waggett about it.

26:42.643 --> 26:43.849
A real one.

26:43.977 --> 26:46.139
(Sea pounds, gulls cry)

26:49.733 --> 26:51.519
(Waggett) Yes.

26:52.611 --> 26:54.101
Yes. Right.

26:57.074 --> 26:58.155
Understood, sir.

26:59.868 --> 27:02.951
- Who were you talking to, dear?
- Headquarters darling.

27:03.080 --> 27:06.198
- Extraordinary. Quite extraordinary.
- What is?

27:06.333 --> 27:10.952
Well, it seems the crew have deserted
their ship and returned to the mainland.

27:11.088 --> 27:12.749
She has a very valuable cargo.

27:14.466 --> 27:19.802
Several thousand crates of whisky -
and you cannot trust these islanders.

27:20.514 --> 27:24.132
It's Sunday, dear. No one on Todday
would break the Sabbath.

27:25.185 --> 27:26.971
I will muster my men.

27:30.023 --> 27:32.355
Didn't you hear me, dear?
It's the Sabbath.

27:33.402 --> 27:34.984
You have no men to muster.

27:35.112 --> 27:39.322
And anyway, would it be so terrible
if these nice people did get a few bottles?

27:39.449 --> 27:42.066
The whisky will only end up
in Davey J0nes's locker.

27:42.202 --> 27:44.944
Dolly, if it ends up in Davey J0nes's locker,
that is an act of God,

27:45.080 --> 27:48.789
but if it ends up in Joseph Macr00n's locker,
that is an act of thievery.

27:50.586 --> 27:53.795
No, once you let people take the law
into their own hands, it is anarchy.

27:53.922 --> 27:57.335
Anarchy? On a Sunday? On Todday?

27:57.467 --> 28:02.177
Surely not, I mean...
Do you hear that, dear?

28:03.807 --> 28:05.343
Silence.

28:06.351 --> 28:09.514
The birds on Todday are not allowed
to tweet on the Sabbath.

28:13.317 --> 28:14.307
Post office.

28:14.443 --> 28:18.186
Captain Waggett here, Peggy.
Put me through to George Campbell, please.

28:18.322 --> 28:19.733
Right, ho.

28:23.452 --> 28:25.443
(Phone ringing)

28:30.042 --> 28:31.703
- Hello?
- 'Who is this?'

28:31.835 --> 28:34.702
Yes, Mrs Campbell.
Yes, this is Captain Waggett here.

28:34.838 --> 28:37.626
'At the lighthouse.
I'm afraid we have an emergency on.

to your son, Corporal Campbell,'

28:40.219 --> 28:42.506
immediately, be so good as to fetch him.

28:42.638 --> 28:47.929
I certainly not fetch my George,
nor will you speak to my George.

even if he did go to Canada,
did not invent the telephone

28:58.820 --> 29:01.482
'for it to be given to man
to mock the Sabbath!'

29:03.075 --> 29:07.364
Mother, how could you?
That must've been something important.

29:07.496 --> 29:10.705
I do not approve of the use
of that instrument on this day.

29:10.832 --> 29:12.869
Mother, we must move with the times.

29:13.001 --> 29:15.914
Oh, you're becoming very glib,
George Campbell.

29:16.046 --> 29:19.255
What times will we be moving with,
in eternity?

29:19.383 --> 29:21.215
You're being ridiculous, Mother.

29:21.343 --> 29:24.381
Don't you dare "ridiculous" me,
George Campbell!

29:24.513 --> 29:26.129
You get to your room this instant!

29:26.265 --> 29:30.054
There'll be no more church for you
this day!

29:32.271 --> 29:33.636
(Dog barking)

29:33.772 --> 29:35.934
(Knocking continues)

29:39.152 --> 29:40.517
Mr Waggett!

29:40.654 --> 29:44.272
George is in his room with his Bible
and bread and cheese

29:44.408 --> 29:47.150
and he will not be allowed out
till Sabbath end.

29:47.286 --> 29:50.369
"Not be allowed out"?
I've never heard anything so preposterous.

29:50.497 --> 29:53.990
We have just been preached to
on the commandments.

29:54.126 --> 29:56.584
Are you not familiar with the fourth,
Mr Waggett?

29:56.712 --> 29:58.578
Yes, of course I am.
It's the adultery one?

29:58.714 --> 30:01.456
"Remember the Sabbath day
and keep it holy!"

30:02.384 --> 30:04.671
Ah, well, Mrs Campbell,
was it not you

30:04.803 --> 30:07.841
who answered the telephone
this morning, on the Sabbath?

30:07.973 --> 30:10.465
How dare you insult me,

30:10.600 --> 30:13.388
you who would lead my son away
from the true path?

30:13.520 --> 30:18.640
Mrs Campbell, our forces are at this very
moment fighting Hitler in north Africa.

30:18.775 --> 30:20.482
The Nazis keep fighting on a Sunday,

30:20.610 --> 30:23.068
so how can we be expected
not to fight on a Sunday?

30:23.196 --> 30:25.563
The Isle of Todday is not in north Africa!

30:26.491 --> 30:28.277
There are cannibals in Africa,

30:28.410 --> 30:31.619
but no one is going to persuade my son
to eat human flesh.

30:31.747 --> 30:35.115
Good God, woman, nobody's asking your son
to eat human flesh.

30:35.250 --> 30:38.663
I insist upon talking
to Corporal Campbell right now!

30:39.504 --> 30:40.494
Just"

30:53.477 --> 30:56.185
They don't seem to realise
what I'm up against here.

30:56.313 --> 30:57.474
No, dear.

30:57.606 --> 30:59.563
I mean, what would my colonel think

30:59.691 --> 31:03.275
if he knew that the corporal
in my Home Guard refuses to take an order

31:03.403 --> 31:06.816
because he's been locked in his bedroom
by his mother?

31:06.948 --> 31:10.236
My mother used to say,
when I was a little girl,

31:10.369 --> 31:12.610
"Dolly, never trust a native."

31:15.791 --> 31:18.123
Yes, but that was in Ranchipur
during the Raj

31:18.251 --> 31:20.117
and she was talking about
the kitchen staff.

31:21.088 --> 31:25.173
Yes, dear, I believe you're right.
The cook was always pilfering.

31:37.562 --> 31:39.348
(Man) Well, hello again.

31:40.232 --> 31:41.597
(Macroon) Aye.

31:43.110 --> 31:46.899
- How are things in the tweed business?
- You can tell I'm a tweed salesman?

31:47.030 --> 31:48.646
By the cut of your cloth.

31:48.782 --> 31:50.068
No, no.

31:50.200 --> 31:55.240
Ma McPhee, your landlady.
It is a small island, Mr Brown.

31:55.789 --> 31:59.623
I hear you use the post office
to store live ammunition. Is that safe?

31:59.751 --> 32:04.621
Ah, well, I'm keeping watch -
Lieutenant Macroon of the Home Guard.

32:04.756 --> 32:09.421
And yourself-
fit, young tweed salesman that you are?

32:12.305 --> 32:14.797
- Exempt.
- There's a thing, eh?

32:15.684 --> 32:17.891
I was hoping you could sell me
a packet of Players.

32:18.019 --> 32:21.887
- What time will the post office be open?
- On the Sabbath day?

32:22.023 --> 32:25.641
If I was so much as to open that shop door
and lean across the counter

32:25.777 --> 32:28.144
and lay hands to a packet of cigarettes,

32:28.280 --> 32:33.366
it is my belief that God himself
would strike me down dead on the instant

32:33.493 --> 32:35.905
with a fierce heart attack.

32:39.166 --> 32:40.907
Tweed, my arse!

32:41.042 --> 32:43.079
(Motorbike starts)

32:59.060 --> 33:01.848
(Macroon) '50,000 cases of whisky.'

33:06.735 --> 33:08.976
(Clock strikes)

33:14.201 --> 33:16.112
(Shop bell rings)

33:16.995 --> 33:18.656
Ah, Mr Macroon.

33:24.544 --> 33:26.160
It's about Peggy.

33:27.088 --> 33:30.422
And myself. Um...
We want to get married.

33:30.550 --> 33:34.919
And I was hoping, Mr Macroon,
that you'll say yes and give us your blessing.

33:35.639 --> 33:37.880
It's getting late, Sergeant.

33:38.016 --> 33:40.348
Marriage is an exhausting subject,

33:40.477 --> 33:43.560
especially on this particular night
of endurance.

33:44.773 --> 33:46.980
The Sabbath will soon be over.

33:47.108 --> 33:48.598
(Knock on door)

33:51.029 --> 33:52.315
Ah.

33:52.447 --> 33:55.280
Sergeant,
the very person I was hoping to see.

33:55.408 --> 33:57.775
- Evening, sir.
- Good evening, Mr Macroon.

33:57.911 --> 34:00.198
Ah, come in, come in. You're welcome.

34:01.790 --> 34:05.499
I wish I could offer you a dram,
but I have nothing but lemonade.

34:05.627 --> 34:07.664
Ah, no, thank you.

34:08.713 --> 34:13.047
Er, Sergeant,
er, we've got a bit of an emergency.

34:13.176 --> 34:18.467
Um... Just want to put you in the picture.
A few words.

34:20.058 --> 34:22.299
You won't be taking lemonade yourself,
Sergeant?

34:22.435 --> 34:25.052
- No, thank you.
- That's an encouraging sign.

34:29.985 --> 34:31.190
It...

34:31.319 --> 34:33.650
(Footsteps walk away)

34:44.498 --> 34:46.284
(Quietly) It's about this wreck.

34:46.418 --> 34:48.750
The cargo might be tampered with.

34:50.672 --> 34:52.208
I shouldn't be at all surprised, sir.

34:53.007 --> 34:55.090
I think it's my duty to stop the looting.

34:55.217 --> 34:58.927
Beg pardon, sir, I don't believe
the Home Guard could stop it.

34:59.055 --> 35:01.547
Nor the Brigade of Guards,
for that matter.

35:01.683 --> 35:05.301
You're saying I can't trust my men?
Yes, quite, quite.

35:05.437 --> 35:09.897
- Well, then, it's up to you and me.
- You and me, sir?

35:10.025 --> 35:14.940
I was hoping that Corporal Campbell would
be able to help us, but he's... indisposed.

35:15.822 --> 35:20.362
I plan to mount a guard. You will take
first watch, in case they strike tonight.

35:20.493 --> 35:23.702
I will relieve you at first light.
Those are my orders.

35:23.830 --> 35:24.945
Very good, sir.

35:28.376 --> 35:30.492
Er... Good night, Mr Macroon.

35:30.629 --> 35:32.620
Good night, Mr Waggett.

35:34.424 --> 35:35.755
Good night.

35:42.849 --> 35:45.011
(Shop bell jangles)

35:46.770 --> 35:48.181
(Door shuts)

35:48.313 --> 35:52.181
Did you ever hear, Sergeant,
of a reiteach?

35:53.276 --> 35:55.643
Yes, an old custom.

35:55.779 --> 36:00.398
Minister Macalister told me about it-
a pre-wedding party.

36:00.533 --> 36:05.903
When a man wants to marry a girl,
he must ask her father for a reiteach.

36:06.790 --> 36:11.409
It's a great night out, believe you me.
It's a wonderful night. Everybody comes.

36:11.544 --> 36:15.583
- You mean Peggy and I ought to have one?
- Oh, aye. Oh, aye.

36:15.715 --> 36:20.175
And you must have a couple of cases
of whisky of the father's choice.

36:20.303 --> 36:24.262
You see, you can't have a wedding
without a reiteach.

36:24.391 --> 36:27.053
And you can't have a reiteach
without the whisky.

36:27.185 --> 36:30.723
And, well, without the whisky,
you can't have a wedding.

36:32.190 --> 36:35.228
You know, some might say
this is blackmail.

36:35.360 --> 36:38.898
Ah, some might.

36:39.781 --> 36:43.194
(Biff er whispering) Angus, you will take
him round the feet.

36:43.326 --> 36:45.784
You, Sammy,
you will take him round the neck.

36:45.912 --> 36:48.244
And I will pin his arms.

37:03.304 --> 37:04.794
Hm.

37:16.568 --> 37:17.558
<i>Bum!</i>

37:17.694 --> 37:19.150
(Thud, groan)

37:21.197 --> 37:22.187
Sergeant.

37:23.825 --> 37:29.070
Sergeant, you gave us a surprise.
We were meant to sneak up behind you.

37:29.205 --> 37:31.993
- We were meant to surprise you!
- We weren't going to hurt you.

37:32.125 --> 37:34.958
We were just going
to put you out of the way.

37:35.086 --> 37:36.668
(Angus) But you heard us sneaking up

37:36.796 --> 37:40.255
and we were doing the panther crawl,
just the way you taught us.

37:40.383 --> 37:45.002
Not like that, I didn't! On your toes,
move on your toes, light and quiet.

37:45.138 --> 37:48.506
- The panther crawl, come on try it again.
- Och, no, Sergeant.

37:48.641 --> 37:51.679
We really didn't want to do it
in the first place.

37:51.811 --> 37:53.597
You are too rough, Sergeant.

37:53.730 --> 37:56.222
Well, if you do it properly
I can't hurt you, can I?

37:56.357 --> 37:59.190
Come on, try it again.
Take a firm grip.

38:03.990 --> 38:05.947
Tighter. Tighter!

38:06.701 --> 38:09.238
There, you've got me now - helpless.

38:10.872 --> 38:13.830
(Odd) A couple of cases
of Macr00n's choice, whatever it is.

38:18.379 --> 38:19.460
(Clatter)

38:22.926 --> 38:24.166
(Clatter)

38:27.680 --> 38:29.296
- We're going out...
- Ssh!

38:30.141 --> 38:33.259
(Whispers) We're going out to the wreck.
It's nearly midnight.

38:50.328 --> 38:52.069
My goodness, George!

38:55.750 --> 38:57.081
(Groans)

38:59.420 --> 39:01.912
(Sammy) Why didn't you just come down
by the stairs?

39:02.048 --> 39:04.665
Mother keeps the key to my room
in her nightdress.

39:06.719 --> 39:08.050
(Biff er) Ah! At last.

39:08.179 --> 39:10.546
- (Sammy) I fetched him.
- I was wondering where you were.

39:23.987 --> 39:27.070
- (Brown) 'Very well, Mrs Waggett.'
- Dolly.

39:27.198 --> 39:28.814
But as soon as your husband returns,

39:28.950 --> 39:32.113
would you please advise him
that the Ministry of Defence's priority

39:32.245 --> 39:35.237
is to locate and secure a small red
leather case from the cargo,

39:35.373 --> 39:36.955
'before she goes down?'

39:37.083 --> 39:39.450
A case of what? Whisky?

39:40.169 --> 39:43.378
'It's vital that this doesn't fall
into the wrong hands.'

39:43.506 --> 39:46.589
And of course, I don't need to remind you,
Dolly, this is top secret.

39:46.718 --> 39:48.925
'It's a matter of national security.'

39:49.053 --> 39:50.589
(Dolly) 'A red case.'

39:50.722 --> 39:52.508
Righty ho, hush, hush, very good.

39:52.640 --> 39:55.132
- All right. Goodbye, Mr Brown.
- 'Thank you.'

39:55.268 --> 39:57.134
- Bye.
- 'Goodbye.'

39:58.313 --> 40:00.145
A red case?

40:01.190 --> 40:02.931
Get your Wellies on, Peggy.

40:03.067 --> 40:04.398
(Replaces handset)

40:11.492 --> 40:15.486
Dear God, how in your name is my George
going to find the courage

40:15.622 --> 40:19.741
to stand up to this mother of his,
without the help of a wee whisky?

40:19.876 --> 40:21.708
Is a miracle too much to ask?

40:22.503 --> 40:25.541
Just one or two... cases.

I've never seen it for sale here.
It's just for the Yanks.

43:19.097 --> 43:23.091
It is so good,
it's why America brought in prohibition.

43:23.226 --> 43:26.014
(Sammy) It's an emotional night,
right enough, Joseph.

43:26.145 --> 43:30.013
So how come you have a face on you
that would turn a funeral up a side street?

43:30.149 --> 43:32.015
Och, I'm just thinking,

43:32.151 --> 43:35.985
a few of these cases will supply
and make us a memorable reiteach.

43:36.114 --> 43:40.904
And the reiteach, in turn, will seal a
lonely and bereft future for an old man.

43:41.035 --> 43:42.491

- I've been tied up like this for hours, sir.
- Monstrous, who did this?

49:28.924 --> 49:32.087
I haven't got a clue. Came up behind me.
Next thing I knew I was...

49:32.219 --> 49:36.634
- Well, here I am. Didn't see a thing.
- How many fingers am I holding up?

before it went down.

- Mr Brown.
- Macroon.

54:32.728 --> 54:36.096
I couldn't sleep earlier. Got up.

54:36.231 --> 54:39.769
I went down to the crag that overlooks
the Skerrydoo and the wreck and...

54:39.902 --> 54:44.317
I could have sworn, Macroon,
I saw a flotilla of little boats.

54:45.157 --> 54:49.572
Ah, well, that's a common enough
occurrence among mainland people.

54:49.703 --> 54:52.491
Staring at the sea can induce apparitions.

54:52.623 --> 54:53.658
Well,

54:53.791 --> 54:57.204
you and your apparitions will have heard
I'm looking for a little red leather case.

54:57.336 --> 55:00.624
- It's in the hold of that ship.
- How would I have heard of such a thing?

55:00.756 --> 55:03.794
Well, didn't you, yourself, tell me
it was a small island?

55:04.760 --> 55:07.718
Keep it in mind, Macroon.
It belongs to the people I represent.

55:08.847 --> 55:10.212
The Tweed Association?

55:13.060 --> 55:17.805
I'll take that as a no.
Enjoy your tea party, Macroon.

55:21.026 --> 55:22.107
While you can.

55:37.209 --> 55:40.543
(Macroon) 'lt got me thinking
Mr Brown and that little red case

55:40.671 --> 55:43.163
'had come my way for a reason.

55:44.174 --> 55:48.668
'I just have to figure out how that reason
could maybe work to our advantage.'

56:04.820 --> 56:08.654
I tell you, Constable,
there is whisky hidden in this town.

56:08.782 --> 56:13.697
So you say, sir, but I haven't so far
come across a single bottle.

56:16.582 --> 56:18.573
(Gentle snoring)

56:23.171 --> 56:26.789
Whisky goes into the barrel
rough and colourless.

56:27.676 --> 56:31.886
And then,
someone s0mewhere's lifetime later,

56:32.014 --> 56:37.430
comes out as the beautiful, amber,
golden liquid that it is.

56:37.561 --> 56:41.475
And that is the magic of God's guidance.

56:43.150 --> 56:45.061
It's not man's.

56:46.403 --> 56:53.025
Now, I'd like it fine if you allowed
the bands to be read for a solstice wedding.

56:54.786 --> 56:56.902
But two daughters at the one go?

56:57.039 --> 57:00.498
I mean, who is going to be there
to work the telephone?

57:00.626 --> 57:05.746
- Were you not young yourself once?
- Aye, well, if I was, I grew out of it.

57:06.757 --> 57:14.757
Some people say there's no such thing
as love at first sight, but I know there is.

57:16.850 --> 57:19.091
I'm the lucky chap who's experienced it.

57:22.773 --> 57:23.808
Twice.

57:23.941 --> 57:25.727
(# Swing music playing)

57:25.859 --> 57:27.770

57:44.628 --> 57:47.620
(# Fiddle plays a romantic melody)

58:23.250 --> 58:27.539
(Minister) Let me present our guest
from down south, Sergeant Odd,

58:27.671 --> 58:33.383
a man who single-handedly trained
and honed our Home Guard

58:33.510 --> 58:36.593
into the fierce fighting machine
they now are.

58:36.722 --> 58:38.338
(Chuckling)

58:38.473 --> 58:43.559
Some people say there's no such thing
as love at first sight, but I know there is.

58:45.272 --> 58:47.479
I am the lucky chap who experienced it.

58:48.525 --> 58:49.515
Twice.

58:54.031 --> 58:55.988
The first time,

58:56.116 --> 59:00.030
when I saw the island emerge through
the mist from the deck of the steamer,

59:00.162 --> 59:03.996
and the second,
when I first set eyes on my Peggy.

59:04.124 --> 59:07.992
(Doctor) George, our school master,
is known throughout the island

59:08.128 --> 59:11.211
for his fierce, independent mind,

59:11.339 --> 59:17.130
and for his inability not to be intimidated
by anyone - especially women.

59:17.262 --> 59:19.094
(Laughter)

59:19.222 --> 59:24.592
I have only ever stood and spoke
in a classroom with children.

59:27.731 --> 59:29.187
And so...

59:30.108 --> 59:31.598
And so...

59:33.653 --> 59:36.395
And so that will do for me.
(Laughter)

59:36.531 --> 59:38.693
(Clock ticking)

59:38.825 --> 59:41.692
(# Solemn church organ)

59:44.289 --> 59:47.452
I will now speak in praise
of my own daughters.

59:48.835 --> 59:54.672
Highland beauties they are, right enough,
and fine daughters they have been to me...

59:55.884 --> 59:57.545
...a crabbit old man.

59:57.677 --> 59:59.213
(Laughter)

01:00:08.188 --> 01:00:10.145
It was only this last night...

01:00:12.067 --> 01:00:14.900
...that I laid two crying peats
on the fire.

01:00:16.655 --> 01:00:20.614
And as I gazed at them,
they started to glow.

01:00:23.286 --> 01:00:27.120
And as the flames grew, they engulfed me,

01:00:27.249 --> 01:00:35.043
and I was carried away on the spirit
of the smoke to the land of my youth.

01:00:37.050 --> 01:00:40.839
And the love of my life, your mother.

01:00:47.644 --> 01:00:51.854
You young couples will wing your way
to your own nesting ground.

01:00:53.775 --> 01:00:56.517
And hopefully, from time to time...

01:00:58.405 --> 01:01:00.737
...you will look back to this island.

01:01:01.992 --> 01:01:03.699
Hm?

01:01:03.827 --> 01:01:08.321
This island of your birth
and ever-changing youth.

01:01:13.461 --> 01:01:14.826
Did I really say all that?

01:01:14.963 --> 01:01:17.170
- (Laughter)
- Ah, well...

01:01:18.008 --> 01:01:20.500
<i>- Sléinte.
- (PM) Sléinte.</i>

01:01:21.386 --> 01:01:24.754
I will marry the happy couples
on the solstice.

(George) I may have had too much to drink.

01:01:36.943 --> 01:01:39.560
Well, I wouldn't know,
because I've never had too much to drink.

01:01:39.696 --> 01:01:43.815
Well, speaking as one with considerable
experience in matters of drink,

01:01:43.950 --> 01:01:47.159
I must warn you to beware of the reaction.

01:01:47.287 --> 01:01:49.699
Men like yourself are born

01:01:49.831 --> 01:01:53.870

- Peggy?
- Oh, it's you, Captain Waggett.

of .300 ammunition in the post office.

01:03:11.579 --> 01:03:14.367
Yes, now, can you make sure
it's on the boat for Obaig tomorrow?

01:03:14.499 --> 01:03:17.366
- I'll see to it, Captain.
- All right, Peggy.

01:03:18.378 --> 01:03:20.369
Er... Good night.

01:03:23.675 --> 01:03:25.882
This is for tomorrow's boat.

01:03:30.849 --> 01:03:32.886
In the morning, Peggy,

01:03:33.018 --> 01:03:37.478
put a call through to Ma McPhee's
lodging house, for Mr Brown.

01:03:37.605 --> 01:03:43.100
Just give a message saying that Mr Macroon
will see him at his convenience.

01:03:44.863 --> 01:03:49.198
And, Ma McPhee, I hope your varicose veins
are in no way debilitating.

01:03:50.827 --> 01:03:52.693
It's nothing, it's nothing at all.

01:03:52.829 --> 01:03:55.662
It's just something
I came across yesterday

01:03:55.790 --> 01:03:58.782
that might be of interest to Mr Brown.

01:04:01.171 --> 01:04:05.085
It may also be helpful to Captain Waggett,
in a roundabout way.

01:04:05.967 --> 01:04:08.083
(Singing and laughter inside)

01:04:10.847 --> 01:04:12.053

You come here debauched and shameless.
What have you to say for yourself?

01:04:43.421 --> 01:04:46.664
I have a great deal to say for myself,
Mother.

01:04:59.938 --> 01:05:04.023
Three tellings have convinced me
that I quite possibly am.

01:05:05.402 --> 01:05:08.770
And if I am,
it is nobody's business but my own.

01:05:09.656 --> 01:05:12.193
Will you go make yourself a cup of tea,
Mother?

01:05:12.325 --> 01:05:14.487
I've a few things I will talk over
with you.

01:05:14.619 --> 01:05:18.738
I certainly will not make tea
on your orders, George Campbell.

01:05:18.873 --> 01:05:21.035
Do you know what the time is?

01:05:21.167 --> 01:05:24.751
I don't, but I do know
I've never been allowed up this late

01:05:24.879 --> 01:05:27.746
and I am possibly
the only man on this island

01:05:27.882 --> 01:05:32.752
who wears his pyjamas under his trousers,
in case his mother orders him to bed.

01:05:32.887 --> 01:05:35.219
It is quarter of two!

01:05:35.348 --> 01:05:39.683
Well, I was at the reiteach
of Sergeant Odd and Peggy Macroon tonight.

01:05:39.811 --> 01:05:42.473
Oh, and I suppose Catriona Macroon
was there with you.

01:05:42.605 --> 01:05:44.892
And it was our reiteach too, yes.

01:05:45.775 --> 01:05:48.642
Catriona and I will be married
on the solstice.

01:05:48.778 --> 01:05:53.898
And if you want to stay on this island,
I think, you'd better accept the fact.

01:05:54.033 --> 01:05:56.900
If I want to stay on this island?

01:05:57.036 --> 01:06:00.529
I think you'd be wise to make yourself
as agreeable as you can

01:06:00.665 --> 01:06:03.373
- or you can emigrate to Glasgow.
- Have you gone mad?

01:06:03.501 --> 01:06:06.289
Not at all. I've gone sane.

01:06:06.421 --> 01:06:10.255
I think we should resume this conversation
tomorrow, when you're sober.

01:06:10.383 --> 01:06:13.045
Oh, we'll be resuming it, all right!

01:06:13.178 --> 01:06:16.716
Because I am giving you this night
to think over what I am about to tell you.

01:06:18.224 --> 01:06:22.092
Mother, I am trying to persuade Catriona
that, when we get married,

01:06:22.228 --> 01:06:24.936
she comes here to live with us
at the school house.

01:06:25.064 --> 01:06:27.726
Now, you can keep your own place
at the house,

01:06:27.859 --> 01:06:31.227
but you will make no attempt to take hers.

01:06:32.197 --> 01:06:35.610
But if you'd rather not put your pride
in your pocket,

01:06:35.742 --> 01:06:37.904
I think you'd better telegraph
to Aunt Anne

01:06:38.036 --> 01:06:40.994
that you will be crossing to Obaig
on Saturday's boat

01:06:41.122 --> 01:06:44.114
and you will arrive in Glasgow
that very night.

01:06:44.250 --> 01:06:46.617
You smell of drink,

01:06:46.753 --> 01:06:50.792
and you dare stand here in front of me
in bare-faced defiance?

01:06:50.924 --> 01:06:55.964
(Catriona) 'Dear God, give George
the strength to get through this night alone.'

01:11:00.798 --> 01:11:04.917
I do believe, Father, the knitting
of his mind has become fankled.

01:11:05.052 --> 01:11:07.794
My, my, Cyril, cutting the colonel off
like that, how brave!

01:11:07.930 --> 01:11:10.672
You going all the way to Obaig,
just for a short talk with him?

01:11:10.808 --> 01:11:13.675
I'm not going anywhere near Obaig, Dolly.

01:11:14.812 --> 01:11:17.600
I'm going to see
the Customs and Excise people at Nobast.

01:11:17.732 --> 01:11:20.394
- Then why did you...?
- More to me than meets the eye.

01:11:21.360 --> 01:11:24.227
Yes, dear.
Yes, I've often heard you say so.

01:11:27.575 --> 01:11:29.031
(Pots ball)

01:11:29.160 --> 01:11:31.777
You're getting rather good at this,
darling.

01:11:31.913 --> 01:11:32.903
<i>Sléinte.</i>

01:11:33.039 --> 01:11:35.827
- Thanks for this.
- (Macroon) The Duke of Windsor.

01:11:37.084 --> 01:11:38.995
The Duke of Windsor?

01:11:39.128 --> 01:11:42.871
Oh, and such fine handwriting
he has too, eh?

01:11:43.007 --> 01:11:46.875
Education is a wonderful thing, to be
able to write curlicues the way he can.

01:11:47.011 --> 01:11:49.628
Macroon, you didn't?
Please tell me you didn't.

01:11:49.764 --> 01:11:52.631
I only read a little bitty
of the correspondence

01:11:52.767 --> 01:11:55.634
between himself
and his American divorcee.

01:11:56.479 --> 01:11:59.642
With the odd reference
to his Nazi friends thrown in.

01:12:02.568 --> 01:12:04.650
Don't you fret, Mr Brown.

01:12:05.488 --> 01:12:10.949
Like every other postmaster in the land,
I have signed the Official Secrets Act,

01:12:11.077 --> 01:12:13.034
and I shall stand by it.

01:12:13.162 --> 01:12:16.245
Good man.
Doing your bit for king and country.

01:12:18.125 --> 01:12:22.585
(Macroon) 'Mr Brown, didn't get
his red case back without a wee favour.

01:12:23.714 --> 01:12:25.455
'When he returns to the mainland,

01:12:25.591 --> 01:12:28.629
'I need him to give Captain Waggett
a glowing report.

01:12:29.303 --> 01:12:32.341
'If they replace him
with someone more efficient...

01:12:32.473 --> 01:12:34.680
'Well, that would never do.'

01:13:34.285 --> 01:13:37.619
(Brown) Sorry, old fellow.
It's a military imperative.

01:13:37.747 --> 01:13:39.033
Good man.

01:13:42.793 --> 01:13:45.785
- Get out of there!
- In a minute! Hello, operator.

01:13:45.922 --> 01:13:47.412
Hello. Is that Peggy?

01:13:47.548 --> 01:13:49.960
Just a minute, just a minute!
Peggy, it's Mr Brown.

01:13:55.056 --> 01:13:58.469
That was Mr Brown, to tell us
the Customs cutter is approaching the bay.

01:13:58.601 --> 01:14:01.218
The man is having
his twisted joke with us.

01:14:02.897 --> 01:14:04.558
Thank you, good man.

01:14:09.904 --> 01:14:11.315
Aye.

01:14:13.199 --> 01:14:14.655
Aye.

01:14:15.576 --> 01:14:17.066
Right, oh.

01:14:17.203 --> 01:14:18.489
That was Roddy.

01:14:18.621 --> 01:14:21.409
Mr Brown was not having a joke.
The cutter is on its way.

01:14:21.540 --> 01:14:24.953
It's Farquharson and his excise men.
Hide the whisky.

01:14:31.467 --> 01:14:34.585
- Farquharson, this is madness.
- Waggett, the Customs and Excise,

01:14:34.720 --> 01:14:37.883
namely myself, are now in charge
of this operation, not you.

01:14:38.015 --> 01:14:40.222
From now on,
you are simply the informer.

01:14:42.645 --> 01:14:45.103
We're not looking for the needle,
we're looking for the haystack,

01:14:45.231 --> 01:14:47.393
and that haystack shelters
in the cave at Seal Bay.

01:14:47.525 --> 01:14:50.267
I suggest we get back in your boat
and make a course for Seal Bay.

01:14:50.403 --> 01:14:53.111
- 'Right now!'
- 'I can't arrest a cave.

01:14:53.239 --> 01:14:57.028
'I want to catch these thieving islanders,
with the goods.'

01:14:57.159 --> 01:15:00.493
'Yes, and I have seen the goods
and they're in the cave, I told you so.'

01:15:00.621 --> 01:15:02.453
I repeat, you are the informer.

01:15:02.581 --> 01:15:04.788
'You have informed.
Don't let me tell you that again.'

01:15:04.917 --> 01:15:06.999
'Trust me, Farquharson,
I know these people.'

01:15:07.920 --> 01:15:09.206
(Clock chimes)

01:15:09.338 --> 01:15:12.205
'Constable McPhee has searched the village
from top to toe.'

01:15:12.341 --> 01:15:16.756
'After I have made my arrest
we can drive to this cave of yours.'

01:15:16.887 --> 01:15:20.630
- My men are experts.
- So are the men of Todday.

01:15:27.148 --> 01:15:29.810
(Constable) You won't find
any whisky, sir. I can vouch for that.

01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:47.832
(Hammering on door)

01:15:57.553 --> 01:16:02.423
Miss Macroon! I'm sorry,
but I must speak with your father.

01:16:03.309 --> 01:16:06.427
My father is in bed,
where all decent people should be.

01:16:08.439 --> 01:16:11.431
Oh, it's yourself, Captain Waggett.

01:16:13.194 --> 01:16:15.276
I thought you went to Obaig
on the Island Queen.

01:16:15.404 --> 01:16:19.068
Yes, indeed,
but I changed my travel plans.

01:16:19.200 --> 01:16:24.866
Please, Miss Macroon, wake your father.

01:16:35.883 --> 01:16:38.591
Are you positive there's been no warning?

01:16:38.719 --> 01:16:41.837
- How could there be?
- Macroon can get where gas can't.

01:16:44.600 --> 01:16:49.265
Mr Farquharson, what brings you here
so early in the morning?

01:16:49.396 --> 01:16:52.013
We're here because of the sinking
of the Cabinet Minister.

01:16:52.149 --> 01:16:54.857
- Search everywhere, high and low.
- Sir.

01:16:54.985 --> 01:16:56.521
I'll do upstairs.

01:17:45.327 --> 01:17:47.568
You should get that toilet door fixed,
Macroon.

01:17:47.705 --> 01:17:49.867
Well, I don't know
what it's like on the mainland,

01:17:49.999 --> 01:17:53.208
but here on the island, it's very rare
for somebody to steal a bucket of shite.

01:17:54.795 --> 01:17:56.661
Clean as a whistle, sir.

01:18:05.514 --> 01:18:08.381
Sorry to have disturbed you
and your family, Macroon.

01:18:08.517 --> 01:18:11.305
(Macroon) Of course you are,
Mr Farquharson.

01:18:11.437 --> 01:18:14.020
You're welcome here, any time.

01:18:21.030 --> 01:18:22.520
(Peggy) Oh!

01:18:22.656 --> 01:18:23.646
(Shop bell rings)

01:18:25.492 --> 01:18:28.985
I ordered this box of ammunition
be returned to Ordinance.

01:18:29.121 --> 01:18:32.864
Get it to the pier right now and on to
the Island Queen as soon as she gets in.

01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:35.958
Yes, sir. I'll get someone to come
and collect the box.

01:18:37.671 --> 01:18:42.586
That Farquharson -
it's a dirty, dirtyjob he has.

01:18:42.718 --> 01:18:45.426
Aye, keep a close eye on him.

01:18:47.765 --> 01:18:51.508
(Waggett) I told you a house-to-house
search would be a waste of time!

01:18:51.644 --> 01:18:53.260
Now can we go to Seal Bay?

01:18:54.355 --> 01:18:56.813
We found nothing
because they were ready for us,

01:18:56.941 --> 01:18:59.933
and I see no reason to tell them
what we're going to do next.

01:19:00.069 --> 01:19:02.811
- Where's your car?
- It's over...

01:19:04.615 --> 01:19:08.324
- It's over by the post office.
- Go and get it.

01:19:08.452 --> 01:19:10.363
Discreetly.

01:19:10.996 --> 01:19:13.488
- We'll meet you at Seal Bay.
- Right.

01:19:24.093 --> 01:19:26.084
(Hammering)

01:19:34.979 --> 01:19:37.471
(Peggy) Surely they wouldn't be heading
for Seal Bay?

01:19:38.440 --> 01:19:41.148
(George) However would they know
about that?

01:19:41.277 --> 01:19:44.736
(Bain) I told Waggett himself
to take a look at Seal Bay.

01:19:47.366 --> 01:19:51.325
Well, why should I help you men
to ruin my business?

01:19:51.453 --> 01:19:54.036
I have sold not a drop
since the ship went down.

01:19:54.164 --> 01:19:56.656
Judas! Judas!

01:19:56.792 --> 01:20:02.663
Aye, well, we don't have a village idiot.
We just take it in turns.

01:20:08.304 --> 01:20:09.669
Judas!

01:20:50.137 --> 01:20:52.094
Hello? Hello?

01:20:54.975 --> 01:20:57.012
What kind of parking is this?
It's insane!

01:20:57.144 --> 01:20:59.977
- Move it?
- Can you? Yes. Yes. Thank you.

01:21:15.621 --> 01:21:17.203
Seal Bay!

01:21:18.957 --> 01:21:20.413
Seal Bay!

01:22:24.440 --> 01:22:27.683
- On your way, then.
- Aye. Just so, just so.

01:22:28.819 --> 01:22:31.277
(Lorry starts up)

01:22:32.573 --> 01:22:33.654
(Cheering)

01:23:00.642 --> 01:23:03.100
It's an empty cave, Waggett.

01:23:05.731 --> 01:23:07.062
Come on.

01:23:10.194 --> 01:23:11.855
(Engine spluttering)

01:23:11.987 --> 01:23:14.103
Sorry, I didn't have time to fill her up.

01:23:14.239 --> 01:23:17.448
(Macroon) Oh, no. Now we are for it.

01:23:23.415 --> 01:23:24.871
There you are, Biff er.

01:23:25.709 --> 01:23:28.326
- Tragic.
- Aye, but necessary.

01:23:29.505 --> 01:23:31.041
Try her now.

01:23:31.173 --> 01:23:32.288
(Engine starts)

01:23:59.451 --> 01:24:01.613
More to me than meets the eye,
Farquharson.

01:24:05.916 --> 01:24:09.875
(Macroon) 'We lost valuable time
and now they had the advantage,

01:24:10.003 --> 01:24:13.041
'but every resistance movement
has a rogue element,

01:24:13.173 --> 01:24:17.542
'a lone wolf capable of risking everything
for the cause.'

01:24:21.014 --> 01:24:22.846
Halt, who is going there?

01:24:22.975 --> 01:24:25.012
What in the bloody hell
do you think you're playing at?

01:24:25.143 --> 01:24:28.807
I'm playing at guarding the road according
to instructions from Captain Waggett.

01:24:29.606 --> 01:24:31.813
We've been invaded by the Boche.

01:24:31.942 --> 01:24:36.152
Angus, it's me.
Have you gone out of your mind?

01:24:36.280 --> 01:24:37.361
Not at all.

01:24:37.489 --> 01:24:42.199
I am willing to give the supreme sacrifice
to keep this island Gaelic.

01:24:42.327 --> 01:24:44.944
Look, Private, move out of the way
or you will be court-marshalled.

01:24:45.080 --> 01:24:47.287
I cannot be court-marshalled,
because I am not a real solider.

01:24:47.416 --> 01:24:51.205
That is why I can only be accepting orders
from Captain Waggett.

01:24:51.336 --> 01:24:53.794
Can't you see
I am Captain bloody Waggett?

01:24:53.922 --> 01:24:57.085
But the Hun is wily
and up to all sorts of tricks.

01:24:57.217 --> 01:24:59.379
You told us so yourself, Captain.

01:24:59.511 --> 01:25:02.048
One could be made up
to impersonate yourself

01:25:02.180 --> 01:25:04.888
in order to infiltrate this island.

01:25:05.017 --> 01:25:09.136
Anyway, whoever you are, you cannot
be going on without the password.

01:25:09.271 --> 01:25:10.477
(Bird flutters)

01:25:14.693 --> 01:25:17.856
Well done, Waggett.
You can be proud of them.

01:25:17.988 --> 01:25:19.695
No password, no whisky.

01:25:20.282 --> 01:25:22.364
Whisky, the very word.

01:25:22.492 --> 01:25:24.153
Pass, friend.

01:25:46.850 --> 01:25:48.306
We've got them!

01:25:52.522 --> 01:25:53.887
(Waggett) Come on!

01:25:55.484 --> 01:25:58.602
Come on!

01:26:06.244 --> 01:26:08.406
(Bicycle bells ringing)

01:26:13.919 --> 01:26:17.082
Clear out, will you?
Will you clear out the way?

01:26:24.012 --> 01:26:25.798
(Laughter, cheering)

01:26:26.723 --> 01:26:29.932
In the name of Customs and Excise,
stand aside.

01:26:30.060 --> 01:26:32.427
- Deploy the horn!
- (Horn honking)

01:26:33.438 --> 01:26:35.475
I think they have us beat, sir.

01:26:37.609 --> 01:26:38.974
(Horn honking)

01:26:43.532 --> 01:26:47.321
The man made this sacrifice
for his country.

01:26:47.452 --> 01:26:49.568
He's an example to us all.

01:26:49.705 --> 01:26:53.039
(Biff er) Well, it has been a longer day
for yourself, Sammy,

01:26:53.166 --> 01:26:55.578
than it has been for the rest of us.

01:26:55.711 --> 01:26:59.545
What with Mr Mackenzie due home
on leave any time now.

01:27:00.298 --> 01:27:04.587
I hear he once threw his horse
over a dyke into the next field

01:27:04.720 --> 01:27:07.178
when his plough got bogged down.

01:27:09.766 --> 01:27:11.302
Farquharson, go ahead.

01:27:26.199 --> 01:27:27.815
Thank you, sir.

01:27:29.619 --> 01:27:31.030
(Clears throat)

01:27:32.664 --> 01:27:37.909
Captain Waggett, it is my unpleasant task
to have to inform you

01:27:38.044 --> 01:27:42.834
that you are to taken to the Customs
and Excise in Obaig and be interviewed.

01:27:42.966 --> 01:27:45.628
And... and wait.

01:27:45.761 --> 01:27:49.971
Anything you say hereto me will be
taken down and may be used in evidence.

01:27:50.098 --> 01:27:51.509
Good grief, whatever for?

01:27:51.641 --> 01:27:54.508
You sent a box of ammunition
to the mainland, is that correct?

01:27:54.644 --> 01:27:56.510
(McPhee) I can corroborate that, sir.

01:27:56.646 --> 01:27:59.604
We were all in Macr00n's post office
when Captain Waggett ordered it sent.

01:27:59.733 --> 01:28:01.223
(Farquharson) And you sent a note

01:28:01.359 --> 01:28:03.896
stating that you were
personally responsible.

01:28:04.029 --> 01:28:08.273
- Yes, yes, what is wrong with that?
- That box contained bottles of whisky.

01:28:09.743 --> 01:28:13.031
- Whisky?
- Whisky for export only.

01:28:13.163 --> 01:28:17.828
Whisky authenticated as belonging
to the cargo of The Cabinet Minister.

01:28:17.959 --> 01:28:19.541
This is utterly impossible.

01:28:19.669 --> 01:28:23.833
Farquharson, you know that I am incapable
of doing something illegal.

01:28:23.965 --> 01:28:26.172
You have ten minutes to pack a bag.

01:28:26.301 --> 01:28:30.920
And don't try and make a run for it-
you're on an island.

01:28:34.518 --> 01:28:36.100
(Dolly laughing)

01:28:38.313 --> 01:28:39.303
Dolly?

01:28:46.363 --> 01:28:48.525
I will wait outside.

01:28:54.371 --> 01:28:56.203
- Cheers.
- (Clinks glasses)

01:29:10.095 --> 01:29:12.632
It's just a slap on the wrist, darling.

01:29:30.991 --> 01:29:32.698
(Sammy) Poor Mr Waggett.

01:29:32.826 --> 01:29:36.364
(George) Aye, he is going to miss
the wedding.
