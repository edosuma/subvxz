03:31.559 --> 03:34.517
Yeah, follow me through here.
I'll show you the showroom.

03:34.518 --> 03:36.258
Cool.

03:36.259 --> 03:38.695
Actually, um, Oz...

03:38.696 --> 03:41.350
Oz, do you, uh, have a sec?

03:41.351 --> 03:42.873
Can you show this
young lady around?

03:42.874 --> 03:46.007
Uh, well never mind.

03:46.008 --> 03:47.400
Just, uh, do your thing.

03:47.401 --> 03:49.097
Tunnel vision.

03:49.098 --> 03:52.579
Uh, well, I think we have, uh,

03:52.580 --> 03:54.755
a few things from the
'90s you might be into.

03:54.756 --> 03:55.930
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, please.

03:55.931 --> 03:57.932
Great. All right, I'll show you.

04:13.818 --> 04:16.036
Um...

04:16.038 --> 04:17.168
Uh, sorry.

04:17.168 --> 04:19.128
Uh, just hold on a second.
I'm...

04:21.216 --> 04:23.740
Where.

04:23.741 --> 04:26.047
Never mind.

04:26.048 --> 04:27.396
I'll find it later.

04:27.397 --> 04:31.226
Hey, listen, did you get
that old '83 up and running?

04:31.227 --> 04:32.836
Yeah, I think so.

04:32.837 --> 04:34.360
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

04:34.361 --> 04:35.448
Well, I'm gonna kick your ass

04:35.449 --> 04:36.579
in a head-to-head
here in a minute.

04:36.580 --> 04:38.668
Yeah.

04:38.669 --> 04:41.018
Don't you laugh at me, you
little millennial motherfucker.

04:41.019 --> 04:42.585
I'm gonna pop you right
in the starfish.

04:42.586 --> 04:45.588
Whoa. Okay. God.

04:45.589 --> 04:47.764
Hey, what'd you
think of that girl?

04:47.765 --> 04:50.680
Uh... girl? What girl?

04:50.681 --> 04:53.074
The girl that was
in here earlier.

04:53.075 --> 04:55.511
Oh, my God. You are hopeless.

04:55.512 --> 04:58.775
I got her phone number.
You wanna call her?

04:58.776 --> 05:00.255
No, that's creepy.

05:00.256 --> 05:02.344
Come on. Oh, that's not creepy.
Call her.

05:02.345 --> 05:04.085
How is that not creepy?
That's...

05:04.086 --> 05:07.393
Well, fine. Suit yourself.

05:07.394 --> 05:09.264
Um...

05:11.833 --> 05:13.442
Listen, um...

05:15.140 --> 05:17.272
I got some bad news.

05:17.273 --> 05:20.841
Uh, it looks like...

05:20.842 --> 05:24.279
we're gonna have
to close up shop.

05:24.280 --> 05:28.501
Close up, like f...
Like, forever?

05:28.502 --> 05:31.591
Yeah, we're just not getting

05:31.592 --> 05:34.158
the business that
we used to get.

05:34.159 --> 05:35.986
23 years I've been here.

05:35.987 --> 05:38.338
I thought I'd make
it to 25, but...

05:40.209 --> 05:41.688
You okay?

05:41.689 --> 05:45.822
Yeah, yeah, I'm just,
uh, a little confused.

05:45.823 --> 05:46.823
Yeah, me too.

05:46.824 --> 05:48.085
I never understood

05:48.086 --> 05:51.175
why arcades went outta
fashion in the first place,

05:51.176 --> 05:52.655
so what the hell do I know?

05:52.656 --> 05:54.091
You know a lot.

05:58.967 --> 06:00.924
How long?

06:00.925 --> 06:02.710
A month?

06:04.668 --> 06:05.886
You got any savings?

06:05.887 --> 06:08.192
Yeah, I think so.

06:08.193 --> 06:10.499
Like a couple hundred...

06:10.500 --> 06:13.850
Like a hun... Like
a hundred bucks.

06:13.851 --> 06:15.156
Okay.

06:16.550 --> 06:18.420
Well, look here.

06:18.421 --> 06:22.337
I would not be here today
if it wasn't for you

06:22.338 --> 06:24.339
and all the great
work that you did,

06:24.340 --> 06:29.737
so I think it's only fair that
we split everything 50/50.

06:31.086 --> 06:33.000
Are you serious?

06:33.001 --> 06:36.351
Yeah, I'm serious.
You deserve it.

06:36.352 --> 06:39.702
Thank you.

06:39.703 --> 06:42.705
Hey, listen, I gotta go up
north for a couple weeks...

06:42.706 --> 06:44.577
Family bullshit.

06:44.578 --> 06:47.231
So, you're gonna have
to look after the shop,

06:47.232 --> 06:48.929
take care of things.

06:48.930 --> 06:49.931
All right.

06:51.541 --> 06:52.802
All right, I tell you what,

06:52.803 --> 06:54.500
why don't you just take
the rest of the day off

06:54.501 --> 06:56.545
and, uh, go get drunk?

06:56.546 --> 06:57.894
You know?

06:57.895 --> 07:00.593
Can I give you some
old man advice?

07:00.594 --> 07:04.118
Uh, don't just go and get
another job in a repair shop.

07:04.119 --> 07:06.555
You're better than that.

07:10.604 --> 07:13.867
Go and find something
that you really wanna do.

07:13.868 --> 07:17.566
You spend enough time making
other people's games beautiful.

07:17.567 --> 07:19.526
Do something for you, okay?

07:29.231 --> 07:31.101
- You ready for another?
- Yeah, thanks.

07:31.102 --> 07:32.974
- There ya go.
- Thanks.

07:36.934 --> 07:38.457
Hey, Audrey.

07:38.458 --> 07:40.197
Hey, Tess. Tom Cat?

07:40.198 --> 07:41.939
Yes, please.

07:45.508 --> 07:47.901
What's on?

07:47.902 --> 07:50.469
What?

07:50.470 --> 07:52.601
What are you... What
are you lookin' at?

07:52.602 --> 07:53.950
It's pretty intense,
whatever it is.

07:53.951 --> 07:55.430
Uh, what?

07:55.431 --> 07:58.259
On the TV.

07:58.260 --> 08:00.348
It's off.

08:02.264 --> 08:04.614
Yeah, I know it's off.

08:06.224 --> 08:08.052
Okay, okay, start over.

08:09.489 --> 08:10.881
I'm Tess.

08:12.492 --> 08:14.623
Oz.

08:14.624 --> 08:15.798
Wait. Oz?

08:15.799 --> 08:17.321
Really?

08:17.322 --> 08:18.846
Yeah, it's short for Osgood.

08:20.543 --> 08:23.371
I'm sorry. Have we met before?

08:23.372 --> 08:25.199
Do you not remember
me from earlier?

08:25.200 --> 08:26.461
Were you the girl
from the, uh...

08:26.462 --> 08:28.071
Yep. Yep, yep, yep.

08:28.072 --> 08:31.554
I was looking for a game for
my brother for his birthday.

08:33.817 --> 08:37.645
Actually, that is totally a lie.

08:37.647 --> 08:39.953
I don't know why I
just said that.

08:39.953 --> 08:41.302
I told your boss the same thing,

08:41.303 --> 08:43.696
but I never had any intention
of buying anything.

08:43.697 --> 08:45.219
I just...

08:45.220 --> 08:48.135
I just wanted to come and,
like, check out the games.

08:48.136 --> 08:50.790
Why would you lie about that?

08:50.791 --> 08:52.661
I don't know. 'Cause I
thought it'd be weird

08:52.662 --> 08:53.967
if I just rolled up and said,

08:53.968 --> 08:56.360
"Hey can I come play
some video games?"

08:56.361 --> 08:59.016
But I-it's an arcade-game shop.

09:01.715 --> 09:03.325
Yeah.

09:07.068 --> 09:08.982
Yeah, when you, uh...

09:08.983 --> 09:11.375
When you put it like
that, it makes sense.

09:11.376 --> 09:12.986
Oh, my God.

09:12.987 --> 09:15.902
17.

09:18.166 --> 09:20.776
Oz?

09:20.777 --> 09:25.868
Hey, I thought I told you to get
outta here and go get drunk.

09:25.869 --> 09:29.090
I'm about to head
out myself, so...

09:32.267 --> 09:34.051
Oz?

09:35.662 --> 09:38.186
Hey. Oz.

09:47.021 --> 09:49.240
Oz!

09:55.464 --> 09:57.205
Where are you?

10:15.440 --> 10:17.311
What the hell is that?

10:32.588 --> 10:35.678
You weren't supposed to be here.

10:47.777 --> 10:49.909
I'm so sorry, Jerry.

11:08.668 --> 11:10.843
Have you ever tried a Tom Cat?

11:10.844 --> 11:12.496
No. What is that?

11:12.497 --> 11:14.977
It's a kind of gin,
but it's so good.

11:14.978 --> 11:17.545
It's smoky like mescal. Try it.

11:17.546 --> 11:19.503
- No, uh, I'm good.
- Try it. Come on.

11:19.504 --> 11:21.158
- Okay.
- Don't be a baby.

11:23.944 --> 11:24.987
Right?

11:24.988 --> 11:27.337
That's actually...
That is really good.

11:27.338 --> 11:29.644
Like gin and mescal had a baby.

11:29.645 --> 11:31.952
Yeah. Exactly.

11:33.823 --> 11:36.825
I hope this doesn't
sound too creepy.

11:36.826 --> 11:38.784
I've totally seen
you in here before.

11:38.785 --> 11:40.524
- Really?
- Yeah.

11:40.525 --> 11:43.614
I don't remember you. Well, I usually
sit over there in that corner,

11:43.615 --> 11:46.705
with my notebook, making notes.

11:46.706 --> 11:48.837
- You're a writer?
- I'm a writer by night.

11:48.838 --> 11:51.100
By day, I'm a receptionist.

11:51.101 --> 11:54.190
Well, technically, I
work for a temp agency.

11:54.191 --> 11:56.977
I'm on unemployment.
I'm unemployed.

12:02.547 --> 12:07.247
If you ever wanna get, like, a
drink or coffee or whatever

12:07.248 --> 12:11.294
somewhere else sometime...
you could have my number.

12:11.295 --> 12:15.082
Well, um, act... the thing is,
I don't really have a phone.

12:17.388 --> 12:19.302
That's, like, the lamest
excuse I've ever heard.

12:19.303 --> 12:20.826
No, I... Really, I don't.

12:20.827 --> 12:23.089
I don't. You can ask anyone.

12:23.090 --> 12:24.568
Really?

12:24.569 --> 12:25.613
Mnh-mnh.

12:25.614 --> 12:27.920
- How do you call people?
- Pay phones.

12:27.921 --> 12:29.182
They still make those?

12:29.183 --> 12:31.227
I-I guess.

12:34.536 --> 12:36.580
Wow.

12:36.581 --> 12:38.757
You're an antique.

12:38.758 --> 12:41.934
I've been told that
before, actually.

12:41.935 --> 12:44.588
Okay, well, how should
we do this, Osgood?

12:44.589 --> 12:46.590
Um...

12:46.591 --> 12:49.071
I could send my
carrier pigeon over.

12:49.072 --> 12:51.770
Or smoke signals. We
could do smoke signals.

12:51.771 --> 12:54.773
Um, I'm gonna be at
the arcade all...

12:54.774 --> 12:57.123
All day tomorrow if
you wanna come by.

12:57.124 --> 12:59.255
Yeah. Yeah, that'd be awesome.

12:59.256 --> 13:01.127
I'm gonna leave around
4:00, go get some dinner.

13:01.128 --> 13:02.389
If you haven't eaten,

13:02.390 --> 13:04.913
maybe, if you wanted,
you could come with me.

13:04.914 --> 13:06.567
- Perfect.
- Yeah?

13:06.568 --> 13:07.568
Yeah, that sounds great.

13:09.092 --> 13:13.313
All right, see you
tomorrow, Osgood.

13:13.314 --> 13:14.619
I'll see ya.

13:17.579 --> 13:19.319
Sorry if this was weird.

13:19.320 --> 13:20.842
No, not weird.

13:20.843 --> 13:22.365
- It was a little weird.
- Unh-unh.

13:22.366 --> 13:24.759
Tess.

13:52.396 --> 13:54.441
Oh.

17:03.239 --> 17:04.632
Oh, shit.

17:08.156 --> 17:09.201
Hey.

17:09.202 --> 17:11.159
- Hey.
- Hey, you showed up.

17:11.160 --> 17:13.684
S... Uh, sorry I'm late.

17:15.077 --> 17:17.123
Uh, come on.

17:28.089 --> 17:30.222
So, did you, like, just
wake up or something?

17:30.223 --> 17:33.747
- Yeah. Yeah, I did. I'm sorry.

17:33.748 --> 17:37.142
I just... I had, like, a
really late night last night.

17:37.143 --> 17:38.839
That's cool.

17:38.840 --> 17:40.536
Yeah.

17:40.537 --> 17:41.798
Is your boss gonna be mad

17:41.799 --> 17:44.801
that you just are
opening up shop now?

17:44.802 --> 17:48.110
No. No one ever comes by here.

17:48.980 --> 17:50.852
Well, except for me.

17:58.773 --> 18:00.730
Where do you find
all this stuff?

18:00.731 --> 18:02.384
All over, really.

18:02.385 --> 18:05.083
Um, like junkyards
and garage sales

18:05.084 --> 18:07.694
and side of the road and stuff.

18:07.695 --> 18:10.566
Yeah, I just... I restore
the ones that I can

18:10.567 --> 18:13.091
and the other ones I
just sorta fix up.

18:13.092 --> 18:15.267
I'll paint the sides.

18:15.268 --> 18:17.617
Sometimes I'll just
build a whole new one

18:17.618 --> 18:19.314
using an existing circuit board,

18:19.315 --> 18:21.142
and, yeah, I like to think of it

18:21.143 --> 18:24.277
as bringing the
dead back to life.

18:26.496 --> 18:28.106
Very noble.

18:38.682 --> 18:40.249
Cool!

18:41.642 --> 18:42.816
Do you just imagine, like,

18:42.817 --> 18:45.166
sweeping orchestral music
every time you do that?

18:45.167 --> 18:47.255
'Cause I would.

18:47.256 --> 18:49.039
Definitely will now.

18:49.040 --> 18:50.476
You got any quarters?

18:50.477 --> 18:51.738
Oh, it's all free.

18:51.739 --> 18:54.784
What? Your boss made me pay
yesterday when I came in.

18:56.526 --> 18:58.788
You guys are a bunch of dinguses.
You know that?

18:58.789 --> 19:01.400
This is the one that I saw online
that made me wanna come in.

19:01.401 --> 19:03.184
I used to play it in the
movie-theater lobby

19:03.185 --> 19:05.665
when my parents were
seeing R-rated films.

19:09.800 --> 19:11.279
Mm.

19:18.418 --> 19:20.854
All right, I'm a little
out of practice.

19:20.855 --> 19:23.683
Um, so I know that you just
woke up and everything,

19:23.684 --> 19:25.206
but do you wanna
still get lunch?

19:25.207 --> 19:26.816
- Totally.
- Okay, cool.

19:26.817 --> 19:28.166
I know a really good spot.

19:36.827 --> 19:39.133
I hope you weren't expecting
anything too fancy.

19:39.134 --> 19:40.613
I don't really do restaurants.

19:40.614 --> 19:43.355
Mm, no, this is perfect.
It's tacos and it's beer.

19:43.356 --> 19:44.878
I mean, you can't do
better than that.

19:44.879 --> 19:46.401
Right?

19:46.402 --> 19:49.012
Sometimes I like to sit up here
and look out over the city

19:49.013 --> 19:50.710
and pretend like this
alien invasion is coming

19:50.711 --> 19:52.886
and they're about to
wipe out the entire town

19:52.887 --> 19:56.106
and I'm protected and safe up
here with my tacos and my beer

19:56.107 --> 19:57.717
just watching the
whole thing go down.

19:57.718 --> 19:59.762
What do you do after you finish
your tacos and your beer?

19:59.763 --> 20:01.851
Well, I go to the Sword Emporium
like 45 minutes north of here

20:01.852 --> 20:03.462
and I grab a couple
samurai swords

20:03.463 --> 20:05.333
and then I go hole
up in some motel

20:05.334 --> 20:06.856
right by the vending machine

20:06.857 --> 20:08.467
and then I wait for, like,
the army convoy to come by

20:08.468 --> 20:11.383
and them to join forces with
Will Smith and then I team up.

20:11.384 --> 20:12.949
Wow. You've really
thought about this.

20:12.950 --> 20:15.083
Yep, every day.

20:16.867 --> 20:19.391
Was that just, like,
major nerd central,

20:19.392 --> 20:22.394
or was that a bonding moment?

20:22.395 --> 20:24.004
- Or both?
- Both, I think.

20:24.005 --> 20:25.875
I think it was both.

20:25.876 --> 20:28.574
Yeah, I'm sorry. I'm not...

20:28.575 --> 20:30.880
I'm usually just really
bad at communication,

20:30.881 --> 20:34.406
so when, um, things are going
well, I get all in my head,

20:34.407 --> 20:36.146
and I-I think that I'm
doing something wrong

20:36.147 --> 20:38.061
and then it ends up being bad.

20:38.062 --> 20:40.455
Yeah, I-I do the same thing,

20:40.456 --> 20:42.849
except I always end
up talking a lot,

20:42.850 --> 20:44.807
which I'm sure you've
noticed by now.

21:11.966 --> 21:13.272
Oh, I'm sorry. I...

21:26.459 --> 21:30.070
I really like you, Oz.
I think you're cool.

21:30.071 --> 21:31.942
Um...

21:34.641 --> 21:35.945
I don't know.

21:35.946 --> 21:38.818
I-I feel like I'd be down
to hang out tomorrow,

21:38.819 --> 21:41.255
if you are... I
mean, not tomorrow.

21:41.256 --> 21:43.997
Like, when ever you're free.
It could be whenever.

21:43.998 --> 21:45.477
But, like, soon.

21:45.478 --> 21:48.088
Sorry I'm talking so much. I
do this when I get nervous.

21:48.089 --> 21:51.396
Why are you nervous?
I'm nervous.

21:51.397 --> 21:54.181
- Why are you nervous?
- Because...

21:54.182 --> 21:56.880
you're definitely the prettiest
girl that's ever kissed me.

21:59.013 --> 22:01.275
You're really sweet.

22:01.276 --> 22:02.321
It's true.

22:05.759 --> 22:06.759
Okay, let's go.

22:06.760 --> 22:08.761
- Okay.
- Come on.

22:24.952 --> 22:26.649
Tess?

22:30.044 --> 22:32.307
Jerry?

22:40.663 --> 22:44.318
Hey, man, look, you
can't be in here.

22:44.319 --> 22:46.625
All right?

22:49.324 --> 22:50.977
Don't make me call the cops.

22:50.978 --> 22:52.282
You plugged in.

22:52.283 --> 22:53.980
Huh?

22:53.981 --> 22:56.374
Is it beautiful?

22:56.375 --> 22:57.332
What the fuck are
you talkin' about?

22:57.333 --> 22:59.899
The White Eye.

22:59.900 --> 23:01.988
It looks at you, doesn't it?

23:01.989 --> 23:04.120
Yeah, you gotta go, man.

23:04.121 --> 23:05.514
Just let me touch it.

23:08.387 --> 23:09.822
Ow!

23:09.823 --> 23:11.651
Shit!

23:15.132 --> 23:18.396
Don't just look into the void.

23:18.397 --> 23:21.529
Let the void look into you.

26:14.703 --> 26:16.791
Okay, but why haven't you yet?

26:16.792 --> 26:19.577
I don't know. It just
takes a lot to make a game.

26:19.578 --> 26:21.448
It's a lot of work.
Takes a lot of time.

26:21.449 --> 26:24.233
I know that. Answer
the question.

26:24.234 --> 26:28.760
Uh, money is a thing that
it takes that I don't have.

26:28.761 --> 26:31.110
Well, we could raise money.

26:31.111 --> 26:33.721
If I... If I... If I had
one chance to do it,

26:33.722 --> 26:35.767
I would just wanna make
sure it was perfect.

26:35.768 --> 26:36.985
You know? I wouldn't wanna...

26:36.986 --> 26:40.554
Oz, if you tried even half
as hard as anybody else,

26:40.555 --> 26:42.730
you could make something better
than like 80% of the shit

26:42.731 --> 26:44.079
that comes out every year.

26:44.080 --> 26:45.559
I don't know. I just...
I just...

26:45.560 --> 26:49.737
I want my first thing to be
my absolute best, you know?

26:49.738 --> 26:51.913
I don't wanna... I don't
wanna half ass anything.

26:51.914 --> 26:53.654
You can't think
that way, though.

26:53.655 --> 26:55.787
Miyamoto's first game
was "Donkey Kong."

26:55.788 --> 26:57.963
- Uh, no. No.
- Yeah.

26:57.964 --> 26:59.399
No, no, no, no, no.

26:59.400 --> 27:02.532
Miyamoto worked on a ton of other
games before "Donkey Kong."

27:02.533 --> 27:05.187
"Radar Scope"? Hello?

27:05.188 --> 27:07.320
- Oh, yeah. That's true.
- Mm-hmm. Yeah.

27:07.321 --> 27:09.931
Well, I dunno. It doesn't
really matter anyway now

27:09.932 --> 27:11.454
'cause I'm about to
be out of a job.

27:13.240 --> 27:15.850
What do you mean you're...
You're about to be out of a job?

27:15.851 --> 27:17.939
They're closing this place down.

27:17.940 --> 27:20.289
About to sell all
of our inventory.

27:20.290 --> 27:22.335
Gonna put some shitty
mattress place in here

27:22.336 --> 27:24.251
in like six months.

27:27.428 --> 27:29.124
Shit.

27:29.125 --> 27:30.343
- Yeah.
- I'm sorry.

27:30.344 --> 27:32.954
Mm, it is what it is.

27:32.955 --> 27:35.130
It's gonna be okay.

27:35.131 --> 27:37.089
You know what I think?

27:37.090 --> 27:39.308
What?

27:39.309 --> 27:41.659
I think this is it for you.

27:41.660 --> 27:43.922
- Thank you, I think?
- No. No. No, no, no.

27:43.923 --> 27:45.924
Not... Not like,
this is itfor you,

27:45.925 --> 27:48.143
but, like, thisis it for you.

27:48.144 --> 27:50.015
It's a thing that my mom
used to say all the time.

27:50.016 --> 27:53.366
It means that everybody
gets an "it" moment,

27:53.367 --> 27:56.674
and it's when everything
in the universe

27:56.675 --> 27:58.501
and all around just
aligns perfectly

27:58.502 --> 28:00.503
so that you see exactly
what you should be doing

28:00.504 --> 28:02.070
with the rest of your life.

28:02.071 --> 28:05.073
Right? So for Miyamoto,
it was "Donkey Kong,"

28:05.074 --> 28:07.162
or, like, when Doc Brown
falls on the toilet

28:07.163 --> 28:08.468
and sli... and hits his head?

28:08.469 --> 28:10.513
Right?

28:10.514 --> 28:12.820
And they see it and
they follow it

28:12.821 --> 28:15.214
and... and... and stuff changes.

28:15.215 --> 28:17.869
Stuff happens for them, right?

28:17.870 --> 28:21.176
This is it for you.
This is your moment.

28:26.182 --> 28:28.271
That's just my two cents.

28:30.143 --> 28:32.013
Can I tell you a secret?

28:32.014 --> 28:34.146
Only if it's a good one.

28:34.147 --> 28:35.930
I've never told a soul.

28:35.931 --> 28:37.932
What is it?

28:37.933 --> 28:39.847
Come here.

28:39.848 --> 28:42.937
Okay, so, a couple of years ago,

28:42.938 --> 28:46.811
uh, I made this kinda...
Uh, I made a thing.

28:46.812 --> 28:48.334
I knew it. I knew it.

28:48.335 --> 28:52.164
Well, it's called, uh,
"Lazer Balls," so...

28:52.165 --> 28:54.122
Yeah, it's, like, the
dumbest fuckin' name

28:54.123 --> 28:55.820
I've ever heard of in my life.

28:55.821 --> 28:58.561
Furthermore, I-I never hired,
like, an artist to do...

28:58.562 --> 29:00.912
- No, it's cool.
- Any renderings or anything,

29:00.913 --> 29:02.696
so it just doesn't
look very good,

29:02.697 --> 29:05.220
but I think, you know, the
general idea is there.

29:05.221 --> 29:08.571
And, just, like, the
infrastructure's good.

29:08.572 --> 29:10.617
I just need someone
to take a look at it

29:10.618 --> 29:12.358
and make it sharp
and make it smooth

29:12.359 --> 29:15.840
and make it, you know,
something people would see.

29:15.841 --> 29:17.319
Tess?

29:17.320 --> 29:20.409
Tess?

29:20.410 --> 29:22.368
Hey, are you okay?

29:22.369 --> 29:23.891
Yeah.

29:23.892 --> 29:27.590
Yeah, I just zoned
out for a second.

29:27.591 --> 29:29.592
What's that game over there?
- Aw, it's nothing.

29:29.593 --> 29:31.725
It doesn't even work. It's...
- But what is it?

29:31.726 --> 29:33.553
It's some piece of
shit that came in.

29:33.554 --> 29:35.468
We don't... Doesn't work.
- Should we try it?

29:35.469 --> 29:38.079
No, we should go get a drink.
That's what we should do.

29:38.080 --> 29:39.864
- Oz, you're still sick.
- No.

29:39.865 --> 29:43.171
You shouldn't be drinking.
Yeah. Yeah, you are.

29:43.172 --> 29:46.609
And I'm taking a very big health
risk even hanging out with you.

29:46.610 --> 29:48.568
- Uh...
- You could be Carrier X.

29:48.569 --> 29:50.700
- I could.
- Yeah.

30:33.483 --> 30:34.528
Hey.

30:36.791 --> 30:39.097
Hey.

30:39.098 --> 30:41.577
What are you doing up?

30:41.578 --> 30:44.450
I do this every night.

30:44.451 --> 30:46.147
What?

30:46.148 --> 30:47.715
You're crazy.

30:50.152 --> 30:53.024
Hey, are you okay?

30:53.025 --> 30:56.375
Just, every shitty
thought I've ever had

30:56.376 --> 30:58.333
just comes to me at
3:00 in the morning.

30:58.334 --> 31:00.858
And couple that with the fact

31:00.859 --> 31:04.558
I've got this gorgeous
girl in bed next to me...

31:09.780 --> 31:11.651
I don't know. The last few
days have been a lot.

31:11.652 --> 31:14.523
Just kinda like my mind
is working overtime.

31:14.524 --> 31:17.222
I read somewhere once

31:17.223 --> 31:19.920
that when you wake up
at 3:00 in the morning,

31:19.921 --> 31:21.879
it means that your
brain is operating

31:21.880 --> 31:24.229
at a higher level
than most people's.

31:24.230 --> 31:25.447
Really?

31:25.448 --> 31:28.363
Yeah. Thomas Edison,
I think it was,

31:28.364 --> 31:30.626
he only slept for like
45 minutes at a time.

31:30.627 --> 31:32.106
Hmm.

31:32.107 --> 31:36.241
It's either that, or you're
being possessed by demons.

31:36.242 --> 31:39.331
- It's probably that.
- Yeah, probably.

31:39.332 --> 31:42.421
Earlier when you were
in the bathroom,

31:42.422 --> 31:46.338
I walked by your desk and I saw
something that made me think,

31:46.339 --> 31:48.166
"I really know who this guy is."

31:48.167 --> 31:50.603
Uh-oh.

31:50.604 --> 31:54.433
There was this stack of old
"King's Quest" floppy disks

31:54.434 --> 31:57.740
just sitting there on your
desk waiting to be installed.

31:57.741 --> 32:00.395
It reminded me of this
Tamagotchi that I used to have.

32:00.396 --> 32:01.657
I wore it on my key chain,

32:01.658 --> 32:05.183
for, like, years after
I last used it,

32:05.184 --> 32:07.576
just in case I ever wanted
to fire it up again.

32:07.577 --> 32:09.970
Don't they die when you
don't take care of 'em?

32:09.971 --> 32:13.234
Yeah, yeah, it... it was dead.

32:13.235 --> 32:15.323
Rest in peace.

32:15.324 --> 32:16.759
I'm just telling
you that because,

32:16.760 --> 32:19.893
if one of the things that
you're up thinking about

32:19.894 --> 32:24.593
is the person in bed
with you right now,

32:24.594 --> 32:27.596
you should strike
that off your list,

32:27.597 --> 32:31.470
'cause this is easy,
this is good.

32:31.471 --> 32:34.604
Relax.

32:39.566 --> 32:41.175
Relax.

32:44.745 --> 32:46.702
Relax.

32:50.925 --> 32:52.882
Relax.

32:56.975 --> 32:58.279
Relax.

32:58.280 --> 33:03.284
Tess? Tess? Tess? Tess?

33:03.285 --> 33:08.202
Tess? Tess? Tess? Tess?

33:08.203 --> 33:10.291
What'd you think of that girl?

33:10.292 --> 33:14.295
Tess? Tess? One, zero,
zero, zero, zero, one.

33:14.296 --> 33:17.124
You're definitely the prettiest
girl that's ever kissed me.

33:17.125 --> 33:20.867
Tess? Tess? Why are you nervous?
I'm nervous.

33:20.868 --> 33:22.521
Tess? Tess?

33:22.522 --> 33:24.262
I think this is it for you.

33:24.263 --> 33:27.439
Tess? Tess?

33:27.440 --> 33:28.962
Who are you?

33:28.963 --> 33:31.182
Tess? Tess?

33:31.183 --> 33:33.533
Tess! Tess!

33:36.840 --> 33:39.320
Relax.

33:39.321 --> 33:40.800
Relax.

33:40.801 --> 33:42.846
Relax.

35:37.222 --> 35:38.613
Made of duct tape,

35:38.614 --> 35:40.311
so they slashed the
tires on my car...

35:40.312 --> 35:41.442
- I did that.
- And threw it in the snow...

35:41.443 --> 35:43.618
I-I used to make them, too.

35:43.619 --> 35:45.446
- You made duct-tape wallets?
- Uh-huh.

35:45.447 --> 35:46.969
Did you sell them
for lots of money?

35:46.970 --> 35:49.146
No, I just gave them away
for free to my friends.

35:49.147 --> 35:50.973
- That's so generous of you.
- I know.

35:50.974 --> 35:54.499
My friend, Michael Neukirk, he
wore a duct-tape tux to prom.

35:54.500 --> 35:56.631
- Ooh, that's cool.
- He looked like a fuckin' idiot.

35:56.632 --> 36:00.157
No, that's cool. I used
to, back when I...

36:31.667 --> 36:33.668
I'm so stoned.

36:33.669 --> 36:36.018
I know. Me too. I wanna
play video games.

36:39.588 --> 36:41.981
- What?
- What the fuck?

36:41.982 --> 36:44.288
Oh, did you turn it on?

36:44.289 --> 36:47.769
No, it just keeps
turning on by itself.

36:47.770 --> 36:49.380
Maybe it's haunted.

36:49.381 --> 36:50.468
Probably.

36:50.469 --> 36:52.731
Ooooh. No! No, no, no.
I wanna play it.

36:52.732 --> 36:54.994
- No, you don't.
- Uh, yeah, yeah, I do.

36:54.995 --> 36:57.170
I don't think you do.
It's gonna make you puke.

36:57.171 --> 37:00.173
- What?
- I'm serious.

37:00.174 --> 37:01.479
Do it. You can play.

37:01.480 --> 37:02.784
It's just gonna
ruin your night...

37:02.785 --> 37:04.438
Maybe your life, I don't know.

37:04.439 --> 37:07.354
Oh, well, sounds like you think

37:07.355 --> 37:09.704
maybe it's gonna ruin yournight.

37:09.705 --> 37:11.924
- What are you talkin' about?

37:11.925 --> 37:16.058
Like, maybe you think you're
not gonna get any action.

37:16.059 --> 37:18.322
Well, that is something that
I had thought about before.

37:18.323 --> 37:20.150
It did cross my mind, yeah.

37:24.633 --> 37:27.026
My libido is perfectly
intact, mister,

37:27.027 --> 37:32.205
so if your ego can take a
beating, we'll be just fine.

37:32.206 --> 37:35.513
All right, which one turns it on?
This one?

37:35.514 --> 37:37.428
Don't you dare touch that!

37:37.429 --> 37:40.213
Shit, dude, you can't be in here. Get
outta here! Who does she think she is?!

37:40.214 --> 37:42.259
Who the hell do you
think youare?!

37:42.260 --> 37:44.304
Go, go, go, go, go.
Call the police.

37:44.305 --> 37:46.175
Hey. Hey! You gotta go, man.

37:46.176 --> 37:48.308
You forget yourself?
What the fuck?

37:48.309 --> 37:50.441
No more distractions, all right?
You have a path.

37:50.442 --> 37:52.443
- Get offa me.
- That is an impossibility.

37:52.444 --> 37:54.880
- Let go of me.
- Hey!

38:17.556 --> 38:20.209
Hey.

38:20.210 --> 38:22.256
Are you awake?

43:17.856 --> 43:20.205
Hey.

43:20.206 --> 43:22.250
Hey.

43:22.251 --> 43:23.948
You okay?

43:23.949 --> 43:25.906
Yeah.

43:25.907 --> 43:29.954
You know you were supposed to
come by last night, right?

43:29.955 --> 43:31.738
I was?

43:31.739 --> 43:33.435
Yeah, at 8:00.

43:33.436 --> 43:37.135
Oh, shit, I'm sorry.
I-I totally forgot.

43:37.136 --> 43:40.355
I spent, like, all... all
night last night at the shop.

43:40.356 --> 43:42.401
No worries.

43:42.402 --> 43:44.708
I was just worried, is all.

43:44.709 --> 43:45.970
I'm fine.

43:45.971 --> 43:47.276
Are you sure?

43:49.104 --> 43:52.672
I threw up last night. I
ruined a bunch of stuff.

43:52.673 --> 43:56.720
Can you please go see a doctor?

43:56.721 --> 43:58.852
Oz?

43:58.853 --> 44:00.462
It's just, I... There's a ton
of stuff to do here. I...

44:00.463 --> 44:02.943
Do you want me to bring you
some soup or something?

44:02.944 --> 44:04.205
I can come by.

44:04.206 --> 44:05.120
No.

44:05.121 --> 44:07.121
Okay.

44:07.122 --> 44:09.820
Um...

44:09.821 --> 44:11.299
Well, I still really
think you should go...

44:11.300 --> 44:13.520
For fuck's sake, Tess, I'm fine.

44:15.217 --> 44:16.609
Okay.

44:16.610 --> 44:19.264
You need to trust me.

44:19.265 --> 44:23.007
I do trust you. It's
not about that.

44:23.008 --> 44:24.922
I just... I don't know.

44:24.923 --> 44:28.186
There's something up
with you right now.

44:28.187 --> 44:30.319
Maybe this is how I really am.

44:31.973 --> 44:34.323
I don't believe that.

44:36.238 --> 44:40.720
Listen, if you need anything
or you wanna talk, I'm here.

44:40.721 --> 44:44.289
Otherwise I'll just... I'll
let you do your thing, okay?

44:44.290 --> 44:46.465
Okay.

44:46.466 --> 44:48.380
Sorry I yelled at you.

44:48.381 --> 44:51.122
It's fine.

44:51.123 --> 44:53.255
I'll talk to you later.

44:55.301 --> 44:57.258
Bye, Oz.

44:57.259 --> 44:59.566
Bye.

45:45.830 --> 45:49.615
Ow! Fuck!

45:49.616 --> 45:53.228
Fucking idiot.

46:04.370 --> 46:06.023
The White Eye.

46:06.024 --> 46:08.765
The White Eye.

46:08.766 --> 46:11.115
The White Eye.

46:11.116 --> 46:13.639
The White Eye.

46:13.640 --> 46:15.554
It looks at you, doesn't it?

46:15.555 --> 46:19.297
Doesn't it?

47:28.323 --> 47:31.151
No.

47:39.900 --> 47:42.032
Ones and zeros.

47:42.033 --> 47:43.860
Intelligent design.

47:43.861 --> 47:47.080
Made from chaos to chaos.

47:48.822 --> 47:50.911
Oh, it is so beautiful.

47:53.131 --> 47:55.306
I will do what he cannot.

48:11.845 --> 48:12.932
No!

48:15.849 --> 48:17.502
God!

48:22.290 --> 48:24.770
I know.

48:24.771 --> 48:27.207
I know.

48:27.208 --> 48:32.647
I must choose...

48:32.648 --> 48:34.475
what Ichoose.

48:34.476 --> 48:36.347
Alone.

49:29.792 --> 49:33.056
Ugh, quit checking your phone.

49:33.057 --> 49:34.622
Hmm?

49:34.623 --> 49:36.668
It's amazing what you can see
in the bottom of a tumbler

49:36.669 --> 49:39.192
if you actually look.

49:39.193 --> 49:43.283
Been a source of inspiration for
a lot of writers before you.

49:43.284 --> 49:44.589
Well, maybe I'll quit
checking my phone

49:44.590 --> 49:46.591
if you guys get the TV fixed.

49:46.592 --> 49:48.114
I'm in no hurry.

49:48.115 --> 49:50.943
People don't talk to each
other when the TV's on.

49:50.944 --> 49:53.686
- Sure.
- You all right?

49:55.644 --> 49:58.037
Yeah, yeah. I'm fine

49:58.038 --> 50:01.040
I just...

50:01.041 --> 50:03.956
I'm confused. And annoyed.

50:03.957 --> 50:07.046
But... I'm fine.

50:07.047 --> 50:08.830
I am confused and
annoyed most days.

50:08.831 --> 50:11.833
Quit thinkin' about him.

50:11.834 --> 50:13.183
I don't know what
he said to you,

50:13.184 --> 50:14.619
but whatever it is,
it's not nice,

50:14.620 --> 50:17.622
and anyone who is not nice
to you does not deserve you.

50:17.623 --> 50:20.059
Yeah, I know. I just...

50:20.060 --> 50:23.236
I felt like I was talking
to somebody else.

50:23.237 --> 50:25.195
Unless it was literally
a different person,

50:25.196 --> 50:26.718
then he is exactly who
he's always been.

50:26.719 --> 50:27.936
You just didn't know it.

50:27.937 --> 50:29.808
Now you do.

50:29.809 --> 50:32.637
Just quit checking your phone.

50:32.638 --> 50:36.554
Nothing good appears on that
screen after 10:00 p.m.

51:40.053 --> 51:41.272
Oz?

51:42.708 --> 51:44.230
Oz?

51:48.714 --> 51:50.976
Oz, you left the door open.

55:24.059 --> 55:26.365
Oh, my God! Tess!

55:26.366 --> 55:28.020
Tess.

55:29.413 --> 55:30.630
Tess!

55:30.631 --> 55:33.677
Tess! Tess! Please,
please, please.

56:34.826 --> 56:35.914
Do you see?

56:37.872 --> 56:39.918
Who are you?

56:41.528 --> 56:44.356
Who are you?

56:44.357 --> 56:46.619
I didn't kill the girl.

56:46.620 --> 56:48.100
- Yes, you did.
- No.

56:49.362 --> 56:51.842
You have to break it.

56:51.843 --> 56:53.017
It's unbeatable.

56:53.018 --> 56:55.323
The game killed her?

56:55.324 --> 56:58.501
The game did nothing.

56:58.502 --> 57:02.896
When you play by its rules...

57:02.897 --> 57:04.681
it'll always win.

57:04.682 --> 57:06.640
Did you build this?

57:09.382 --> 57:10.688
We built this.

57:12.559 --> 57:13.820
What is it?

57:13.821 --> 57:16.693
A door to the infinite.

57:16.694 --> 57:17.911
What does that mean?

57:17.912 --> 57:19.086
We're in prison.

57:19.087 --> 57:23.177
And where there's a prison,
there are walls...

57:23.178 --> 57:25.223
Walls that cannot be toppled,

57:25.224 --> 57:27.921
walls that cannot be climbed.

57:27.922 --> 57:31.098
You can't escape this prison.

57:31.099 --> 57:34.580
On this side...

57:34.581 --> 57:37.235
it's hell.

57:37.236 --> 57:39.672
You dream...

57:39.673 --> 57:43.111
but then you wake up
from these dreams.

57:45.418 --> 57:47.114
And then you die,

57:47.115 --> 57:50.683
and all the beautiful things
in your dreams die with you.

57:50.684 --> 57:54.774
But on the other side, there's
time enough for it all,

57:54.775 --> 57:58.865
because there is no time.

57:58.866 --> 58:01.215
And in the infinite,

58:01.216 --> 58:03.522
all things are not
just possible.

58:06.570 --> 58:07.744
They're inevitable.

58:07.745 --> 58:09.920
So I can save her.

58:09.921 --> 58:12.183
No.

58:12.184 --> 58:15.882
You have a higher purpose.

58:15.883 --> 58:18.276
If all things are possible,
then she's still alive!

58:18.277 --> 58:20.278
No! No!

58:20.279 --> 58:23.890
Delete the sequence.

58:23.891 --> 58:26.153
Un... Unset decimal,
unset decimal,

58:26.154 --> 58:27.720
F, F-94, 15, 19...

58:27.721 --> 58:29.505
What the fuck are
you talking about?!

58:29.506 --> 58:32.769
You have a responsibility!

58:32.770 --> 58:36.164
Look beyond what's
in front of you.

58:38.471 --> 58:40.472
Delete the senses.

58:43.345 --> 58:44.955
Break the sequence.

58:52.833 --> 58:54.660
Be the man I could never be.

59:52.850 --> 59:54.372
Tess: Oz...

01:00:00.074 --> 01:00:04.730
Look between the
ones and zeroes!

01:00:07.081 --> 01:00:09.648
Hit reset!

01:06:17.974 --> 01:06:20.801
Get outta here before
I call the cops.

01:06:20.802 --> 01:06:22.455
Maybe he likes arcade games.

01:06:26.939 --> 01:06:29.158
Oz.

01:06:31.117 --> 01:06:33.162
I'm so sorry, Jerry.

01:06:34.599 --> 01:06:37.122
Maybe this is how I really am.

01:06:37.123 --> 01:06:38.689
Be the man I could never be.

01:06:38.690 --> 01:06:40.299
Did you build this?

01:06:40.300 --> 01:06:41.953
We built this.

01:07:32.613 --> 01:07:34.788
Oz!

01:07:52.677 --> 01:07:54.547
Oz?!

01:09:51.143 --> 01:09:52.622
Oz?!

01:09:59.847 --> 01:10:02.284
You can have both.

01:10:02.285 --> 01:10:04.156
Look between the
ones and zeroes, Oz.

01:10:05.766 --> 01:10:07.246
Hit reset.

01:10:08.987 --> 01:10:10.423
No!

01:14:01.828 --> 01:14:03.439
Hey, Jerry.

01:14:05.919 --> 01:14:07.529
Yeah, what's up?

01:14:07.530 --> 01:14:10.096
Hey, is it cool if I use
the phone for a sec?

01:14:10.097 --> 01:14:11.576
I think I finally
found an artist.

01:14:11.577 --> 01:14:12.751
Like, this guy's incredible.

01:14:12.752 --> 01:14:14.623
I saw his pixel art, and
it's just exactly...

01:14:14.624 --> 01:14:15.972
Yeah, you can call
him in a minute.

01:14:15.973 --> 01:14:17.887
Uh...

01:14:17.888 --> 01:14:20.585
first, there's a girl coming
by to look at a game.

01:14:20.586 --> 01:14:23.109
Would you show her around for me?
Okay.

01:14:23.110 --> 01:14:25.111
- Thanks.
- Sure.

01:14:25.112 --> 01:14:28.724
I'm gonna go close this deal.

01:14:28.725 --> 01:14:30.595
It's an end of an era.

01:14:32.946 --> 01:14:34.643
Eh, it's gonna be okay.

01:14:34.644 --> 01:14:36.906
Yeah.
