WEBVTT

00:07.241 --> 00:10.905
DWIGHT: <i>I have the best</i>
<i>stocked survival shelter</i>
<i>in northeastern Pennsylvania.</i>

00:10.978 --> 00:12.071
<i>But everything</i>
<i>has a shelf life.</i>

00:12.145 --> 00:16.082
<i>So I must eat and</i>
<i>then replace everything</i>
<i>that's about to expire.</i>

00:16.149 --> 00:18.050
It's nice not to
have to plan my meals.

00:18.118 --> 00:20.781
You're eating
eight-year-old tomatoes.

00:20.854 --> 00:22.015
They're still good
for another week.

00:22.089 --> 00:23.751
You know, I think I
might have some type
of cheese

00:23.824 --> 00:25.417
in the back of my
fridge you might like.

00:25.492 --> 00:27.825
I've got some cheese
you might like, too.

00:28.061 --> 00:29.791
In between my toes.

00:30.964 --> 00:33.160
DWIGHT: Hardy-har-har.
All right, picture this.

00:33.467 --> 00:35.663
Snowy ash drizzles
from the sky.

00:35.969 --> 00:37.995
A rabid pack of
dogs surrounds you

00:38.138 --> 00:40.164
as the flame at the end
of your stick dies out.

00:40.240 --> 00:43.108
There's only one
hope left for you,
the door to my shelter.

00:43.176 --> 00:46.271
You pound. You beg.
"Dwight, please let me in."

00:46.346 --> 00:48.975
But I ignore your cries
and do not let you in.
You want to know why?

00:49.049 --> 00:51.450
Because of the sign
that says, "No pounding.
No begging."

00:51.518 --> 00:53.578
No, because you
laughed at me.

00:53.654 --> 00:56.419
Kevin will be eaten.
Pam will be taken slave.

00:57.024 --> 01:00.324
Jim will be made
a warlord's jester.
Meredith will do okay.

01:00.861 --> 01:03.524
Be assured this day
will come. It's just
a matter of time.

01:03.597 --> 01:05.394
Could be one month,
could be two months.

01:05.866 --> 01:07.698
Three months.
Could be.

01:08.101 --> 01:09.501
Four months.

01:10.103 --> 01:11.662
I see that happening, yes.

01:11.738 --> 01:13.104
Eight months?

01:14.007 --> 01:15.202
That's a realistic timeline.

01:16.543 --> 01:18.978
Eleven months.

01:19.046 --> 01:20.105
Perhaps.

01:20.180 --> 01:23.776
Okay, wait,
now really think hard
about this one.

01:23.850 --> 01:25.113
One year.

01:26.653 --> 01:28.679
I could see that as
a very real possibility.

01:28.922 --> 01:30.288
Four hundred and
ninety-four months.

01:31.191 --> 01:32.557
I could see that happening.

01:33.093 --> 01:35.790
Four hundred and
ninety-five months.
That's just...

01:57.084 --> 01:59.918
I really
thought I was becoming
too much of a womanizer.

02:00.020 --> 02:03.081
I realized I had shirts
in five different
women's houses.

02:03.323 --> 02:04.552
Still not seeing
the problem there.

02:04.625 --> 02:05.615
All right.

02:05.692 --> 02:08.787
Truth is,
I got a couple love
bumps on my ding-dong,

02:08.862 --> 02:10.854
so I was like,
"Game over."

02:11.231 --> 02:14.861
MICHAEL: <i>It was the best</i>
<i>of times. It was the</i>
<i>"awesomest" of times.</i>

02:14.935 --> 02:17.336
<i>And now Packer</i>
<i>wants to come home.</i>

02:17.437 --> 02:20.839
And look who's here
to sign off on it.

02:20.907 --> 02:22.398
My boo, Holly.

02:23.543 --> 02:25.171
Hi.
Hi.

02:26.713 --> 02:27.772
You must be Todd.

02:27.848 --> 02:29.282
Whoa, I'm sorry.

02:29.349 --> 02:31.011
Michael, I thought
we were meeting
Holly today,

02:31.084 --> 02:32.177
not Jennifer Aniston.

02:33.353 --> 02:34.946
Very funny.

02:35.022 --> 02:36.820
Okay, let's get started.
After you.

02:36.890 --> 02:38.051
Okay.

02:41.628 --> 02:43.096
Michael,
this'll be just us.

02:43.163 --> 02:44.563
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

02:45.532 --> 02:48.297
Just so you know,
he's at his funniest

02:48.368 --> 02:49.893
when you've given him,
like, five shots.

02:49.970 --> 02:50.994
Okay.

02:51.071 --> 02:52.300
And it also helps if
you've had five shots.

02:52.372 --> 02:53.897
I already have.

02:58.512 --> 02:59.741
Why is Packer back?

02:59.813 --> 03:00.906
Is Packer here?

03:00.981 --> 03:02.244
Why is he
talking to Holly?

03:02.315 --> 03:03.544
Don't know, don't care.

03:03.617 --> 03:07.418
Michael loves you,
and your sales speak
for themselves. So...

03:10.691 --> 03:13.092
Yes! The Pack is back.

03:13.160 --> 03:15.425
Ladies and gentlemen,
I would like
to introduce you

03:15.495 --> 03:16.895
to a man who
needs no introduction,

03:16.963 --> 03:19.694
probably because
most of you have
done it with him.

03:19.766 --> 03:21.894
Just kidding. He wouldn't
be interested in any of you.

03:21.968 --> 03:23.334
In all seriousness,

03:23.403 --> 03:27.306
Todd Packer is
a permanent salesman
at this branch.

03:27.374 --> 03:30.538
And I would like to
invite you now to welcome
him with open arms.

03:30.677 --> 03:32.043
Yes!
What?

03:33.313 --> 03:35.077
It's great to
be among friends.

03:35.148 --> 03:38.380
And until then,
you suckers will do.

03:38.452 --> 03:39.784
Nice.

03:39.853 --> 03:41.754
We got burned.
MICHAEL: You did.

03:42.089 --> 03:44.115
You got burned,
because Packer's back.

03:44.191 --> 03:47.559
Packer is turning in
his car for a desk.

03:47.627 --> 03:51.792
He is turning in
his condoms for
a condominium,

03:51.865 --> 03:54.460
although he's probably
going to have to use
condoms from here on out.

03:54.534 --> 03:56.093
Holly. You approved this?

03:56.169 --> 03:57.193
Yes, I did.

03:57.270 --> 03:59.796
I think Todd's gonna
make a great addition
to the staff.

03:59.873 --> 04:01.671
You did approve it?
Yeah.

04:01.742 --> 04:04.769
What don't you understand
about the word "approved"?

04:04.845 --> 04:06.905
It seems a couple
of you don't know

04:06.980 --> 04:08.972
what the word
"approved" means.

04:09.850 --> 04:12.684
I have very little
patience for stupidity.

04:13.320 --> 04:15.619
Sorry we're late.
Gabe fell in the shower.

04:15.689 --> 04:16.884
Such a klutz.

04:16.957 --> 04:19.858
Yeah, and it took
the fire department
forever to get there.

04:19.926 --> 04:22.452
Oh, my God.
Where did this
come from?

04:23.263 --> 04:24.731
Who did this?

04:24.798 --> 04:26.096
PAM: <i>I got Erin</i>
<i>a new computer</i>

04:26.166 --> 04:28.158
because the one at
reception sucked.

04:28.235 --> 04:29.760
I should know.

04:29.836 --> 04:31.702
And I don't want to say
the other one was old,

04:31.772 --> 04:34.708
but its IP number was one.

04:36.877 --> 04:37.970
Right?

04:38.044 --> 04:39.068
Thank you, Pam.

04:39.146 --> 04:40.637
Oh, you're welcome.

04:40.714 --> 04:41.738
My pleasure.

04:50.257 --> 04:51.281
Can I do something for you?

04:51.358 --> 04:53.486
I just helped someone out.
It feels good.

04:53.560 --> 04:54.823
Nice.

04:55.028 --> 04:57.327
You know, I cleaned
up our daughter for,

04:57.397 --> 04:58.888
like, an hour at 4:00 a.m.
this morning, so...

04:59.132 --> 05:00.430
So you know the feeling.

05:02.602 --> 05:04.036
Special delivery for
Dwight K. Schrute.

05:04.104 --> 05:05.265
I didn't order anything.

05:05.338 --> 05:06.567
And I don't have
anything for you,

05:06.640 --> 05:08.768
but I do want to talk
to you about something.

05:08.842 --> 05:10.868
We have been
thinking about where
Packer should sit,

05:11.478 --> 05:13.379
and we can't just
sit around waiting
for Creed to die.

05:14.214 --> 05:15.705
Well, there's a lot
of seats in the annex.

05:15.782 --> 05:17.842
So you wouldn't mind
permanently relocating

05:17.951 --> 05:19.977
so that Packer can
take this desk here.

05:20.420 --> 05:22.412
TODD: Thanks, man.
It would mean a lot to me.

05:22.856 --> 05:25.155
I've been sitting here
for 10 years, Michael.

05:25.258 --> 05:27.318
Well, I was there
for 12 years.

05:27.394 --> 05:29.022
Plus, my name's
carved under the desk.

05:29.196 --> 05:30.926
No, it is not.
It is too.

05:30.997 --> 05:32.329
Where? Let me see this.

05:32.399 --> 05:33.833
Right there.

05:33.900 --> 05:35.061
Check it out.

05:35.135 --> 05:37.001
DWIGHT: Michael, I don't
want to move desks.

05:37.070 --> 05:38.094
MICHAEL: Don't be
a baby. We're...

05:38.171 --> 05:39.503
Okay, there it is.

05:39.573 --> 05:41.235
"Packer was here
and so was your mom."

05:41.308 --> 05:42.298
Yeah.

05:42.375 --> 05:43.365
Do I have any say in this?

05:43.476 --> 05:45.411
MICHAEL: No!
No!

05:45.478 --> 05:46.946
It's $20 to watch, Halpert.

05:48.782 --> 05:51.445
Hey. Whose
dirt box is this?

05:51.685 --> 05:52.914
That's our Zen garden.

05:52.986 --> 05:55.512
What do you
growing here, bull crap?

05:59.025 --> 06:00.186
Hey, Holly.

06:01.294 --> 06:02.785
Hey. What's up, guys?

06:02.863 --> 06:04.297
Don't "what's up" us.

06:04.364 --> 06:07.801
You think you're
so cute with your
pretty blond hair.

06:08.501 --> 06:11.437
Pull it back.
Why did you hire
Todd Packer?

06:11.504 --> 06:13.097
PAM: He's seriously awful.

06:13.173 --> 06:15.199
Michael's recommendation
was glowing.

06:15.308 --> 06:17.777
And honestly,
he's been nothing
but nice to me.

06:17.844 --> 06:20.678
That's how he gets you
to take off your panties.

06:20.747 --> 06:21.908
Why are you nodding?

06:21.982 --> 06:23.450
United front.

06:23.683 --> 06:26.243
Okay, look,
we can't fire someone
because we don't like him.

06:26.319 --> 06:27.787
Right. This isn't the
U.S. government.

06:27.854 --> 06:30.255
What are you referencing?

06:30.323 --> 06:32.292
Everything.
Everything.

06:32.359 --> 06:35.693
Do any of you have
any concrete complaints
about something he's done?

06:35.762 --> 06:37.094
Well, I mean,
he humped Michael.

06:37.163 --> 06:40.565
Well, if that's the case,
I guess I've got
to be fired, too.

06:43.236 --> 06:44.602
Hey. Hey, you guys.

06:44.671 --> 06:46.799
The Yarmouth
Regatta video is up.
Gather round. Check it out.

06:48.575 --> 06:50.305
This guy's on
a full beam reach.

06:50.377 --> 06:51.675
They're hiking out
like mad.

06:51.745 --> 06:53.270
Luff him up. Luff him up.

06:54.347 --> 06:55.440
Nice!

06:57.817 --> 06:59.376
This computer's
a hunk of junk.

06:59.452 --> 07:02.286
Hey, sailor,
come watch your
regatta over here.

07:02.522 --> 07:03.683
Where did you get this?

07:03.757 --> 07:05.419
Pam gave it to me.

07:07.327 --> 07:08.659
This is a sick computer.

07:09.062 --> 07:10.553
Gwen Stefani
has this computer.

07:12.532 --> 07:13.898
Pamela.
Yep?

07:13.967 --> 07:18.166
What does a guy
have to do to whom
to get one of them?

07:18.238 --> 07:19.934
You have a computer, Andy.

07:20.006 --> 07:21.702
Yeah, but if you
donated my computer
to Africa,

07:21.775 --> 07:24.609
it would become famous
as the slowest computer
in Africa.

07:24.678 --> 07:27.512
Okay, listen,
we just don't have
the budget for it, okay?

07:27.580 --> 07:29.776
Reception needed
a computer, so we got one.

07:29.849 --> 07:32.045
Well, Andy's desk
needs a computer.

07:32.185 --> 07:35.349
And, I mean, it's just
kind of a coincidence
that I work there, but...

07:35.422 --> 07:37.584
Yes, but reception
is a one-person department.

07:37.657 --> 07:40.786
If I get you a new computer,
I have to get one
for everyone in sales,

07:40.860 --> 07:43.193
for Dwight, for Stanley.
It would be crazy.

07:43.763 --> 07:47.029
So something good
happening to Stanley
is crazy now.

07:47.100 --> 07:48.295
ANDY: They're not
asking for one.

07:48.368 --> 07:49.495
I am. I need it.

07:49.569 --> 07:52.164
If you're just
handing them out,
I want one, too.

07:52.505 --> 07:54.167
Phyllis, nobody's
handing anything out.

07:54.307 --> 07:55.969
See? That's what
I'm talking about.

07:56.076 --> 07:57.806
What, are you gonna
play mahjongg faster?

07:58.011 --> 07:59.604
PAM: I'm sorry, Andy.

08:04.751 --> 08:06.549
Hey, what's going on,
you guys?

08:06.619 --> 08:07.609
Yeah.

08:07.687 --> 08:08.677
Three muske-queers.

08:09.923 --> 08:11.118
Mean, but good.

08:11.758 --> 08:14.284
So, Todd, this must
be nice for you,
getting off the road.

08:14.361 --> 08:15.989
You get to spend some time
with your daughter.

08:16.062 --> 08:17.530
I don't know.

08:17.597 --> 08:20.032
I love her and all,
but she's turned
into a bitch.

08:20.200 --> 08:22.965
Most days she's great,
but some days she
acts like her mom.

08:23.069 --> 08:25.004
Well, some girls
go through a phase.

08:25.071 --> 08:27.472
Yeah. Your life
is so insane.

08:27.907 --> 08:29.466
You should write a book.

08:29.542 --> 08:30.942
Since when did you
learn how to read?

08:31.044 --> 08:33.206
I do know
how to read, though.

08:33.279 --> 08:36.113
Yeah. You know
how to read a menu.

08:37.884 --> 08:39.147
This guy...

08:42.756 --> 08:46.523
I... He's right.
I mean, I could
lose some weight.

08:46.826 --> 08:48.727
Kevin, in sumo culture,

08:49.329 --> 08:51.594
you'd be considered
a promising up-and-comer.

08:57.504 --> 09:00.997
What the heck?
Why do you have
Erin's computer?

09:01.074 --> 09:02.133
It's crazy, right?

09:02.642 --> 09:04.736
Erin just
wanted me to have it,
so we switched.

09:04.944 --> 09:07.243
What? Erin,
is that true?

09:07.313 --> 09:09.544
I just thought he seemed
to really need a new computer,

09:09.616 --> 09:10.777
and he knows so
much about that one.

09:10.884 --> 09:14.753
Erin, it's not up to you.
This computer was
for reception, okay?

09:14.821 --> 09:16.346
It's not yours
to give away.

09:18.091 --> 09:19.719
Pam.

09:19.793 --> 09:22.888
When I'm freaking out,
I just sort of step back,

09:22.962 --> 09:25.056
take three deep breaths.
I'm not freaking out. Okay?

09:25.131 --> 09:26.759
And then I ask myself,

09:27.901 --> 09:30.200
"Is this worth
freaking out about?"

09:30.270 --> 09:33.001
Andy, why should she
have your crappy computer?

09:33.139 --> 09:34.539
That's interesting.

09:34.607 --> 09:36.576
So you also think
my computer's crappy.

09:36.643 --> 09:38.373
Switch the computers
back, Andy.

09:40.613 --> 09:42.445
Seriously?
Seriously.

09:42.982 --> 09:44.541
Pam, come on.

09:44.617 --> 09:46.347
PAM: Now, please.
ANDY: Fine!

09:49.022 --> 09:51.355
Please make sure
nobody is humping me.

09:52.025 --> 09:53.118
If you're going
back to the annex,

09:53.259 --> 09:54.386
could you take
these to Dwight?

09:54.994 --> 09:56.257
I think the ants
are waking up.

09:56.329 --> 09:57.524
They need to
start farming soon.

09:58.298 --> 09:59.630
Thanks.

09:59.699 --> 10:01.668
Best day ever.
Best day ever.

10:02.435 --> 10:04.597
So much is happening.

10:04.971 --> 10:07.964
Question.
Should I get stripes shaved
into the side of my head?

10:08.041 --> 10:09.373
No. No.

10:09.442 --> 10:10.501
Please.

10:10.577 --> 10:12.375
Did Todd tell you
to do that?
Yes.

10:12.445 --> 10:14.243
Yeah, I thought so.
You love him, right?

10:15.181 --> 10:16.649
You love him. I can tell.

10:16.716 --> 10:18.548
I love you.
No, no, not me.

10:18.618 --> 10:19.813
Him. What...

10:19.886 --> 10:21.377
He's certainly opinionated.

10:21.454 --> 10:22.615
If you're not gonna
take the ants over,

10:22.689 --> 10:24.521
I should probably
just do it myself.
I'm going.

10:24.591 --> 10:29.723
No. Are you jealous of him
because you think
he's funnier than you?

10:30.463 --> 10:31.453
Honey.

10:31.531 --> 10:32.521
I don't think
he's funnier than me.

10:32.599 --> 10:33.760
He's funnier than me.

10:34.934 --> 10:36.266
He's not funny at all.

10:36.803 --> 10:38.362
So I'm less funny
than not funny at all?

10:38.438 --> 10:40.839
Hey, oh-oh, I think the ants
are starting to eat
each other.

10:40.907 --> 10:45.675
No, what I'm saying is
he's not funny, but
you're funnier than he is.

10:46.713 --> 10:49.478
Okay, Bill Cosby,
Steve Martin,

10:50.216 --> 10:51.445
<i>Charlie Bit My Finger,</i>

10:51.518 --> 10:54.454
Michael Scott,
then all the way down here,

10:55.188 --> 10:56.417
Todd Packer.

10:57.423 --> 10:58.516
That's insane.

10:58.591 --> 11:00.856
Honey, he's a jerk.

11:00.927 --> 11:03.954
For Pete's sake,
it just needs to be done.

11:08.902 --> 11:10.894
So you two are
married now, right?

11:10.970 --> 11:12.165
Yeah.

11:12.238 --> 11:14.264
That's sweet.
How's the sex?

11:14.507 --> 11:16.305
Yeah.
DWIGHT: Hey, Packer,

11:16.876 --> 11:18.970
I made you some
hot chocolate.

11:19.045 --> 11:20.069
Why?

11:20.146 --> 11:21.944
'Cause I want to let
bygones be bygones,

11:22.015 --> 11:23.108
show you I'm cool.

11:23.183 --> 11:25.209
You're the new guy.
It's cold out.
I made too much.

11:25.285 --> 11:27.311
I got this awesome
hot chocolate recipe
from my wife.

11:27.387 --> 11:29.151
That's a lot of reasons.

11:29.222 --> 11:30.383
Drink it.

11:30.456 --> 11:31.549
I think I'll pass.

11:32.025 --> 11:34.756
The only hot
chocolate I'm into
is Vivica A. Fox.

11:34.961 --> 11:35.951
Can I talk to
you for a second?

11:36.029 --> 11:37.463
Here.
Okay. Okay. Okay.

11:37.530 --> 11:38.964
So this hot chocolate
thing with Packer...

11:39.032 --> 11:40.398
None of your business.

11:40.466 --> 11:42.867
Well, you know you
can't actually poison him.
Right?

11:43.136 --> 11:44.968
It isn't poison.
It's a laxative.

11:45.038 --> 11:46.404
People take laxatives
all the time.

11:46.472 --> 11:49.806
This is just a lot
more of a laxative.
Let me handle it.

11:50.944 --> 11:52.674
I really think we
should join forces
on this one.

11:52.745 --> 11:53.974
Really?
What do we think?

11:54.047 --> 11:55.675
What would drive him crazy?

11:56.816 --> 11:57.977
I know.
Here we go.

11:58.484 --> 12:00.817
Pepto-Bismol in
his hot chocolate.

12:00.887 --> 12:02.219
You have got to stop

12:02.288 --> 12:03.722
with the hot chocolate stuff.

12:03.790 --> 12:04.814
Okay.

12:04.891 --> 12:06.257
I was thinking
maybe we could
jam his drawers

12:06.593 --> 12:08.027
so they only
come out two inches.

12:08.094 --> 12:09.995
Then, that way,
you can see
everything in them,

12:10.063 --> 12:11.122
but you can't get at it.

12:11.197 --> 12:15.396
Does Edgar Allan Poe
know about that one?
So sinister.

12:15.468 --> 12:16.993
That wouldn't
annoy a person at all.

12:17.070 --> 12:18.561
Where do you come
up with this stuff?

12:18.638 --> 12:21.608
Okay. All right,
well, this isn't my best,
but call Froggy 101,

12:22.075 --> 12:23.976
say that we're
the tour manager
for Justin Bieber,

12:24.043 --> 12:25.170
and we're giving
away free tickets.

12:25.245 --> 12:27.805
We give them a number
to call for the tickets,
and it's his number.

12:27.880 --> 12:29.178
Who is Justice Beaver?

12:30.917 --> 12:33.580
He... It's a
crime-fighting beaver.

12:33.653 --> 12:35.952
Why don't you write
up your best 40 ideas

12:36.022 --> 12:37.388
and e-mail them to me.
Can you do that?

12:37.457 --> 12:38.516
Absolutely.
I'll e-mail you 100.

12:38.591 --> 12:39.581
Okay.

12:39.659 --> 12:43.460
Yeah. Write up
your list of 100, edit it
down to your top 40,

12:43.529 --> 12:44.724
and I'll read it over.

12:44.797 --> 12:46.197
Pam, can I talk
to you in private?

12:46.266 --> 12:48.633
I don't know if there's
really a private place
in this office.

12:48.735 --> 12:50.431
Well, I put a sign-up sheet
in the conference room,

12:50.503 --> 12:52.369
and I signed us
up for three mods.

12:52.438 --> 12:55.897
A mod is five minutes,
and it started two
minutes ago, so...

12:56.009 --> 12:57.602
You did that?
Can we talk about
this in the meeting?

12:57.677 --> 12:59.111
'Cause we're already late.
Okay.

12:59.646 --> 13:00.705
Wow, when did
people sign up for that?

13:00.780 --> 13:01.770
Mind if I close the door?

13:01.848 --> 13:03.043
No.

13:03.116 --> 13:06.109
What you did out there earlier
was totally un-cool.

13:06.185 --> 13:08.780
Well,
what I was supposed to do,
let you walk all over me?

13:08.855 --> 13:10.847
You humiliated me in
front of everybody.

13:11.824 --> 13:14.487
Okay, well, I didn't
think about it like that.

13:14.560 --> 13:16.461
It's just...
I can't do anything about it.

13:16.529 --> 13:18.862
I can't replace your computer
unless that one breaks.

13:18.931 --> 13:21.230
Well, I mean,
it's pretty broken already.

13:21.301 --> 13:24.135
Well, if it breaks
all the way,

13:24.203 --> 13:25.330
I can get you a new one.

13:29.008 --> 13:30.169
Pretty sneaky, sis.

13:33.479 --> 13:37.280
Hey, cats, we got
a jam session in
mods six, nine and 12.

13:41.187 --> 13:42.587
There are 400 of these.

13:42.655 --> 13:44.351
Yeah, I couldn't cut it down.

13:44.424 --> 13:45.619
They're all good.

13:45.992 --> 13:49.759
So good.
"Number three, eat a frog."
That sounds promising.

13:49.862 --> 13:51.558
"Number four, eat a dog."

13:51.798 --> 13:54.427
I don't know, from
a practical standpoint...

13:54.500 --> 13:56.560
One thirty-five.
Did you like
one thirty-five?

13:57.103 --> 14:00.505
"Eat a brog."
Maybe it's 'cause I
didn't understand it.

14:01.808 --> 14:05.245
I just had a couple of notes.
Let me grab a pen and...

14:05.778 --> 14:07.007
Damn it.

14:09.082 --> 14:12.450
Just when we were...
Just when we were
getting going.

14:25.231 --> 14:27.894
Allow all cookies?
Why, soitenly.

14:28.201 --> 14:29.999
<i>Pop-ups? Yes, please.</i>

14:30.837 --> 14:33.830
<i>Bit torrent streaming</i>
<i>from a Somalian music website?</i>

14:33.906 --> 14:35.397
<i>Yeah, why not?</i>

14:36.909 --> 14:39.674
<i>I hope you don't get sick,</i>
<i>Mr. Computer.</i>

14:39.746 --> 14:42.545
<i>Why are you doing</i>
<i>this to me, Andy?</i>

14:42.615 --> 14:44.846
Because I hate
your broke ass.

14:45.318 --> 14:47.947
And a 76ers fan to boot.
I like that.

14:48.020 --> 14:49.648
And you made Hank smile.

14:49.722 --> 14:52.123
That doesn't happen often.
You're very charming.

14:52.392 --> 14:55.362
You know what?
That is something that
you should take upstairs

14:55.428 --> 14:57.659
and use on the people
that really matter.

14:58.731 --> 15:00.529
Why?
I don't know.

15:00.800 --> 15:03.827
Holly mentioned
that there were
some complaints

15:03.903 --> 15:06.065
and that you had
said some things
about Kevin.

15:06.139 --> 15:07.971
Holly said that?
Yeah.

15:08.040 --> 15:10.009
She was laughing hysterically
the whole time.

15:10.076 --> 15:12.045
I guess you said
something weird
about your daughter.

15:12.111 --> 15:15.081
She asked me, Michael.
It would have been
rude not to answer.

15:15.148 --> 15:17.014
You've been on
the road a long time.

15:17.083 --> 15:19.109
And you've been
an outdoor cat.

15:19.185 --> 15:21.051
And now you have
to be an indoor cat,

15:21.521 --> 15:23.319
so you can't be peeing
all over the walls.

15:23.589 --> 15:26.081
Michael, can I open
the kimono with you?

15:27.493 --> 15:29.086
I've been on
the road too long.

15:29.362 --> 15:32.332
But I want to connect
with my daughter.

15:32.398 --> 15:34.560
And it's not right
to call her a bitch
in front of strangers.

15:34.634 --> 15:36.296
No, it isn't.

15:36.602 --> 15:38.571
You're right. I got to...
I got to watch my behavior.

15:38.638 --> 15:39.765
Yeah, a little bit.

15:41.574 --> 15:42.769
Don't give up on me.

15:45.578 --> 15:46.807
I won't.

15:48.181 --> 15:50.673
Okay. Everybody?
I need you to see this,

15:50.750 --> 15:52.912
because maybe
there is somebody here

15:52.985 --> 15:55.750
that you underestimated
who will surprise you.

15:55.822 --> 15:58.155
Todd Packer is
going to apologize.

15:58.257 --> 16:00.123
Kevin, front and center.
Come here.

16:00.693 --> 16:03.458
I got a lot of numbers
here to put together.

16:03.529 --> 16:06.021
Kevin, we know
that you are just
trying to save face.

16:06.098 --> 16:08.226
We know that you are
hurt and embarrassed.

16:08.301 --> 16:09.792
That's silly.

16:09.902 --> 16:12.167
I should be
apologizing to Packer,

16:12.238 --> 16:16.300
'cause everybody
knows that I can dish it
as good as I can take it.

16:16.375 --> 16:20.005
Okay, sweetie, no,
you shouldn't be
apologizing to Packer.

16:20.079 --> 16:21.445
That doesn't
make any sense.

16:21.514 --> 16:23.608
You ready for this?
Are you ready for this?
Mmm-hmm.

16:23.683 --> 16:25.652
Gentlemen,
start your engines.

16:26.252 --> 16:29.848
I'm sorry if you were offended
by my comments earlier.

16:29.922 --> 16:31.857
Well, like I said,
I wasn't offended,

16:31.924 --> 16:33.916
but I'll stand here
for the big show.

16:33.993 --> 16:36.360
Kevin, do you
accept the apology?

16:36.429 --> 16:38.557
Don't do it, Kevin.
That's that fake
kind of apology.

16:38.631 --> 16:39.963
Okay, go back to the annex.

16:40.032 --> 16:42.558
This is textbook.
It's so un-cool.

16:42.635 --> 16:44.604
Ryan does this to
me all the time,

16:44.670 --> 16:46.571
like it's some offense
to have feelings.

16:46.639 --> 16:47.698
Don't do it, Kevin.

16:47.773 --> 16:48.797
Sometimes you overreact.

16:48.875 --> 16:50.275
OSCAR: Michael, how is
this supposed to work?

16:50.376 --> 16:52.311
Packer's gonna keep
saying terrible things,

16:52.378 --> 16:54.472
and then he's just gonna
make half-ass apologies,

16:54.547 --> 16:55.742
and we're back
to square one.

16:55.815 --> 16:58.046
Okay. You want an apology?
Here goes.

16:58.584 --> 17:00.382
Kevin, I am so sorry.

17:01.454 --> 17:03.423
You are skinny,
and you're a genius.

17:03.489 --> 17:06.220
Okay. That...
That was maybe too much.

17:07.093 --> 17:09.994
Packer is a survivor
of divorce, Stanley.

17:10.061 --> 17:13.362
Packer doesn't speak
with his child, Meredith.

17:13.432 --> 17:16.925
Packer never lived up
to his parents'
expectations, Andy.

17:18.938 --> 17:21.169
Angela loves pussycats.
Packer loves...

17:21.240 --> 17:22.263
No, don't.

17:22.340 --> 17:23.934
I was going to say "dogs!"

17:24.010 --> 17:25.911
Okay, you know what?
This is over.

17:25.978 --> 17:28.573
Apology has been issued,
and we're through with it.

17:28.648 --> 17:32.915
Packer's going to be here
until the day he dies,
just like the rest of us.

17:35.087 --> 17:37.352
So, listen, we have to
really scuff this up.

17:37.490 --> 17:40.949
No, no, no, we can say
that the previous owner
was a neat freak

17:41.027 --> 17:43.121
or an elegant old lady,
and she just kept it around

17:43.195 --> 17:45.221
in case her grandkids
came to visit.

17:45.298 --> 17:48.666
But they died,
and they never came.
I'm gonna make myself cry.

17:49.135 --> 17:50.831
Andy, this is the
deal we made.

17:51.337 --> 17:52.532
That's probably good.
That's enough.

17:52.605 --> 17:54.096
We should break
this hinge maybe.

17:54.173 --> 17:55.641
Let's not go crazy.

17:55.708 --> 17:56.835
<i>Well, thanks. Will do.</i>

17:56.909 --> 17:59.174
JIM: Absolutely. Now,
when you get down there,

17:59.245 --> 18:01.373
Jo's a little bit forgetful,

18:01.447 --> 18:03.439
so she may have
locked the gate,

18:03.516 --> 18:05.485
but what you're gonna
do is, go ahead, hop it,

18:05.551 --> 18:07.179
and just head
back to the pool.

18:07.253 --> 18:08.482
<i>That sounds weird.</i>

18:08.554 --> 18:10.716
JIM: It is weird.
Look at you. Perceptive.

18:10.790 --> 18:13.760
Now I know why Jo's
kept her eye on you.

18:15.528 --> 18:17.121
and check out
the Harry Potter World.

18:17.196 --> 18:19.791
JIM: Whatever you want to
do in your spare time
is up to you.

18:19.865 --> 18:22.630
Harry Potter World
is supposed to be fantastic.

18:22.702 --> 18:24.193
Apparently, as soon
as corporate found out

18:24.270 --> 18:26.136
I wanted to come
in off the road,

18:26.205 --> 18:28.970
Jo offered me a cushy
new job in Tallahassee.

18:29.041 --> 18:30.441
And here's the best part.

18:30.509 --> 18:33.069
I'm a huge alligator nerd.

18:33.145 --> 18:37.173
I can name you every genus,
every subspecies.

18:37.249 --> 18:39.047
Also, I'm a huge boob nerd.

18:39.151 --> 18:41.586
Check it out
and have a free
Butterbeer on us.

18:41.654 --> 18:43.179
Keep the receipt,
and we'll get you back.

18:43.255 --> 18:44.723
What are you doing?

18:44.790 --> 18:45.814
This is a very
important client.

18:45.891 --> 18:47.154
All right,
so just pack your bags.

18:47.226 --> 18:49.286
And be sure to bring
those swimming trunks.

18:49.362 --> 18:50.557
Bye, now.
Bye.

18:50.796 --> 18:54.255
I cannot believe this.
You're sending
Packer to Florida? Why?

18:54.467 --> 18:55.594
Because he's a jerk.
You gave him my desk.

18:56.102 --> 18:59.004
Okay. So you're
tricking him into
flying to Florida.

18:59.105 --> 19:01.370
This wasn't my first choice.
Jim had so many better ideas.

19:01.440 --> 19:03.466
You have to tell him.
You have to tell him
what you did.

19:03.542 --> 19:06.137
No, no, no, no, no, no.
That is not in the plan.

19:06.212 --> 19:07.805
That is actually
anti what we're doing.

19:07.913 --> 19:09.882
He is my oldest friend.
I am going to tell him.

19:09.982 --> 19:12.451
Wait. Why don't we
come up with a plan
that we're all happy about?

19:12.518 --> 19:13.816
Yeah, that...

19:13.886 --> 19:17.084
Pam, how is this
thing even any better
than my old computer?

19:17.156 --> 19:19.990
Come on, Andy.
I mean, you said
you wanted a computer.

19:20.059 --> 19:21.425
This is the best I could do.

19:21.494 --> 19:22.962
Where'd you even
find this thing?

19:23.029 --> 19:24.463
Like, in the corner
of the warehouse?

19:24.530 --> 19:26.931
Yes, I found it on
a shelf in the corner
of the warehouse.

19:28.034 --> 19:30.936
All right, well, thank you
for my garbage computer.

19:38.744 --> 19:40.770
You're looking at
the new face of corporate.

19:40.846 --> 19:43.372
Gonna put the "ass"
in Tallahassee.

19:43.449 --> 19:44.712
Yes, about that...

19:44.784 --> 19:46.719
Man, we got to go out
and celebrate tonight.

19:46.952 --> 19:48.420
Well, I don't know
if that's a good idea.

19:48.721 --> 19:50.553
The old ball and chain?

19:50.623 --> 19:52.387
No. No. Nothing
like that at all.

19:52.458 --> 19:54.017
Listen, I'm gonna
tell you something

19:54.093 --> 19:56.494
that none of these
people have the stones
to tell you.

19:56.562 --> 19:57.996
It's your girlfriend.

19:58.664 --> 19:59.927
She's uptight.

20:00.866 --> 20:01.959
Sorry?

20:02.034 --> 20:03.332
I know this stuff can hurt,

20:03.402 --> 20:05.894
but I wish someone
had said something
to me about my ex-wife.

20:05.971 --> 20:08.873
All I'm saying is,
in about a month or so,
have you down to Florida,

20:08.941 --> 20:12.241
introduce you to
all the local talent.

20:15.047 --> 20:17.073
Sounds great.

20:17.149 --> 20:18.276
Yeah.
It's gonna be so good.

20:18.350 --> 20:19.875
MICHAEL: That is.
It's gonna be awesome.

20:19.952 --> 20:23.218
I think you're really going
to enjoy it down there.

20:26.926 --> 20:28.292
I'm sorry
about your friend.

20:28.360 --> 20:30.226
No. He's an ass.

20:31.297 --> 20:32.390
You are.

20:34.300 --> 20:35.563
You are.

20:36.869 --> 20:38.599
What are you,
wicked smaht?

20:39.905 --> 20:41.305
No, you are.

20:41.907 --> 20:43.102
Hoo-ah!

20:48.147 --> 20:49.342
Hoo-ah!

20:51.684 --> 20:54.176
Saw Andy's new
computer you found
in the warehouse.

20:54.253 --> 20:55.516
Yep. Lucked out.

20:55.588 --> 20:56.612
Yeah, you really did,

20:56.689 --> 20:59.591
'cause I know every
inch of that warehouse.

21:00.326 --> 21:01.794
Yep. Super lucky.

21:01.894 --> 21:03.089
Maybe you could
go back down there

21:03.162 --> 21:05.631
and see if you can find
me some extra sick days.

21:12.605 --> 21:13.698
Yeah.

21:15.007 --> 21:18.341
You know what?
I think I saw
one sick day.

21:20.412 --> 21:21.812
I think maybe I saw five.

21:21.881 --> 21:22.940
Three.

21:26.919 --> 21:28.683
I'm full-on corrupt.
