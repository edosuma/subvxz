00:34.840 --> 00:36.919
Survival of the fittest, Son.

00:36.920 --> 00:40.269
The law of the forest, right?
Right.

00:43.960 --> 00:48.265
Of course, your new rifle
gives you a little edge.

00:52.920 --> 00:54.824
Dad, do you hear...

00:55.880 --> 00:58.103
Be real quiet.

01:02.520 --> 01:04.424
Lunch!

01:05.400 --> 01:07.623
And I killed it!

01:07.760 --> 01:09.550
Nancy!

01:10.320 --> 01:12.479
Will you look at the size
of this thing?

01:12.480 --> 01:14.639
There's no way
I'm eating a dead rabbit.

01:14.640 --> 01:16.999
I thought you said
we were leaving.

01:17.000 --> 01:18.399
Will this never end?

01:18.400 --> 01:22.159
Start the fire, Nan.
We are leaving. Before lunch.

01:22.160 --> 01:26.159
George, what happened to "home before
dark. Grab a bite on the way"?

01:26.160 --> 01:29.319
Come on, Nan, we gotta cook it.
It's Ernie's first kill.

01:29.320 --> 01:31.349
Yeah, it's my first blood.

01:31.560 --> 01:33.862
I hope you're proud of yourself.

01:35.320 --> 01:37.384
Look, we'll stuff it. Okay?

01:37.400 --> 01:39.039
You're a butcher, Ernie.

01:39.040 --> 01:41.946
Back off, Sarah!
It was him or me!

02:41.920 --> 02:44.063
I don't feel very good.

02:44.280 --> 02:47.719
- Pull over, Dad, she's gonna launch.
- Ernest.

02:47.720 --> 02:50.959
Open the window, honey,
a little air will do us all some good.

02:50.960 --> 02:54.239
It's the fish.
Ernie, close the cooler.

02:54.240 --> 02:56.119
Ernie, what are you
doing in the fish?

02:56.120 --> 02:58.119
Looking for my baseball glove.

02:58.120 --> 02:59.639
Hey, Dad.
Yeah.

02:59.640 --> 03:02.759
Do you think I can get a pair of
real major league baseball cleats

03:02.760 --> 03:04.119
when we get back?
You bet.

03:04.120 --> 03:06.759
Great. I'm gonna
spike Frankie McDowell.

03:06.760 --> 03:08.919
No, you're not.
Listen to your Mom, Ern.

03:08.920 --> 03:10.759
But he spiked me twice!

03:10.760 --> 03:14.119
That's different. You go
right ahead then. George.

03:14.120 --> 03:18.186
Nan, you don't understand these things.
It's just smart baseball.

03:55.480 --> 03:59.102
Hey, hey. Be careful of
my drawings back there.

03:59.640 --> 04:01.359
And don't step on the trout.

04:01.360 --> 04:05.187
Or my flowers. They're still alive.
Or Mom's flowers.

04:06.200 --> 04:10.221
Oh, Nan, don't you love
roughing it in the wild?

04:10.520 --> 04:12.822
"Roughing it," George?

04:13.160 --> 04:15.159
The only thing rough
about it was when

04:15.160 --> 04:17.959
the generator went out in the
middle of <i>Masterpiece Theatre.</i>

04:17.959 --> 04:19.910
Whoa!

04:21.120 --> 04:22.919
George, please, slow down.

04:22.920 --> 04:24.759
I know these roads
like the back of my hand.

04:24.760 --> 04:27.461
And I know Seattle's
not going anywhere.

04:37.800 --> 04:39.519
Want your sunglasses, George?

04:39.520 --> 04:41.390
No, I'm fine, dear.

04:42.960 --> 04:45.719
Mom, Ernie's playing
with that gun again.

04:45.720 --> 04:47.999
Ernie, don't even touch that gun.

04:48.000 --> 04:50.348
It's a rifle, girls.

04:50.400 --> 04:52.987
If you can shoot with it,
it's a gun.

04:53.360 --> 04:56.519
Oh, my God! Look at that deer!
Did you see that, Sarah?

04:56.520 --> 05:00.199
No, I missed it.
I always miss everything.

05:00.200 --> 05:01.679
Hey, Dad.
Yeah.

05:01.680 --> 05:03.879
Maybe there's a chance
you can blast something.

05:03.880 --> 05:09.039
Ernie, don't give Daddy any ideas.
I could not face two stuffed bunnies.

05:09.040 --> 05:12.184
Did I bring my rifle this time?

05:12.680 --> 05:13.919
Did I? No.

05:13.920 --> 05:17.719
You're right, George, we'll always
remember this as our first camping trip

05:17.720 --> 05:21.229
when Ernie killed something
and you didn't.

05:22.040 --> 05:23.865
My God!

05:41.800 --> 05:43.340
My God.

05:44.080 --> 05:46.223
I thought I hit a man!

05:46.760 --> 05:49.799
Is everybody all right, Nancy?
Okay, kids?

05:49.800 --> 05:52.102
Sarah, are you all right?
Yeah.

05:52.200 --> 05:54.039
George, what is it?

05:54.040 --> 05:56.279
I don't know.
I hardly saw it.

05:56.280 --> 05:58.423
But it's gotta be a bear.

05:58.520 --> 06:00.709
Could it be a gorilla?

06:01.600 --> 06:03.439
I don't think
they get that big around here,

06:03.440 --> 06:05.399
I think we should
just get out of here, Dad.

06:05.400 --> 06:08.119
What if it's still alive?
What if it's in pain?

06:08.120 --> 06:10.119
If it's still alive, it's
probably not in a very good mood.

06:10.120 --> 06:13.105
No way it's alive!
You trashed him, Dad.

06:13.160 --> 06:16.623
There's probably guts and
eyeballs hanging off the bumper.

06:16.640 --> 06:18.079
Knock it off, Ern.

06:18.080 --> 06:21.463
We can't just leave it
in the road, suffering.

06:33.960 --> 06:35.625
Cool. Look.

06:47.800 --> 06:50.421
Everybody, stay in the car.

06:51.000 --> 06:52.119
Son of a bitch.

06:52.120 --> 06:56.584
You drive a classic, you try to take
good care of it, and some dumb animal...

06:57.000 --> 06:59.462
George, shouldn't we call a Ranger?

07:00.760 --> 07:02.471
No, not yet.

07:08.280 --> 07:10.264
You did bring it.

07:10.840 --> 07:13.039
Don't you need some backup?
No.

07:13.040 --> 07:15.263
I said stay in the car.

07:21.840 --> 07:25.861
This is exactly why I brought it.
For protection.

07:26.640 --> 07:28.829
You didn't have to lie.

08:01.480 --> 08:03.020
Shoot it!

08:05.080 --> 08:07.986
It's dead.
Shoot it anyway!

08:43.720 --> 08:47.179
Nan!
What?

08:47.180 --> 08:50.173
I think you better come
take a look at this!

09:14.040 --> 09:15.119
Dad.

09:15.120 --> 09:16.660
Yeah?

09:17.680 --> 09:19.630
What if it's him?

09:19.720 --> 09:22.261
Who?
Bigfoot.

09:24.560 --> 09:26.100
Bigfoot?

09:27.400 --> 09:30.704
Holy shit! Sorry, Dad.

09:31.440 --> 09:33.151
That's okay.

09:33.600 --> 09:36.062
I was looking for the right words.

09:36.680 --> 09:39.479
It smells gross!

09:39.480 --> 09:41.544
George, what is it?

09:43.680 --> 09:45.709
I guess it must be

09:46.320 --> 09:48.304
a Bigfoot.

09:48.680 --> 09:51.142
I don't know what else it could be.

09:51.560 --> 09:53.839
Nancy, this is a big deal.

09:53.840 --> 09:56.142
It's a major discovery.

09:56.320 --> 09:59.863
I bet a museum
would want it or something.

10:02.160 --> 10:04.428
We have to take it home.

10:13.480 --> 10:17.079
Ernie, you and your sister go take the stuff
off the top of the car, put it in the back.

10:17.080 --> 10:18.666
Right, Dad.

10:18.720 --> 10:21.679
And tell your sister she's gonna
have to help us lift this thing up!

10:21.680 --> 10:24.870
Oh, Sarah!

10:29.560 --> 10:32.386
Pull it forward!
Don't worry.

10:43.560 --> 10:45.624
I feel so guilty.

10:47.920 --> 10:50.319
What if it's the only one?

10:50.320 --> 10:53.271
It's not as if
I tried to hit it, Nan.

10:54.000 --> 10:55.711
It was just luck.

10:56.320 --> 10:57.746
Luck?

10:59.920 --> 11:03.702
What if we've just rendered
an entire species extinct?

11:04.680 --> 11:06.345
One of a kind?

11:07.400 --> 11:09.399
This thing could
really be worth something.

11:09.400 --> 11:11.879
I don't believe you just said that.

11:11.880 --> 11:15.159
Come on, Nan. It's all
in how you look at it.

11:30.640 --> 11:32.479
It's alive!
Dad!

11:32.480 --> 11:36.466
Did you see those big honking teeth?
Ernest.

11:36.880 --> 11:38.750
Get me my rifle.

11:38.920 --> 11:40.426
George.

11:41.320 --> 11:43.509
What are you gonna do?

11:45.800 --> 11:48.421
Be careful.
It's still loaded.

11:48.880 --> 11:50.839
George, you're not going out there?

11:50.840 --> 11:53.519
We can't just leave it
in the road, can we?

11:53.520 --> 11:55.743
What if it's suffering?

11:57.240 --> 11:59.110
Sorry.

12:45.320 --> 12:46.951
It's dead!

12:48.880 --> 12:50.670
Are you sure?

12:52.320 --> 12:53.621
Yeah.

12:53.760 --> 12:55.824
Are you really sure?

12:57.000 --> 12:58.870
I'm really sure!

13:01.120 --> 13:03.707
Remember, you were sure before.

13:04.360 --> 13:06.919
Nancy, I'm not a doctor,
but it has no pulse,

13:06.920 --> 13:09.759
it's not breathing
and it's cold as a Popsicle.

13:09.760 --> 13:13.587
Believe me, honey, whatever
it is, it's definitely dead!

16:42.240 --> 16:44.559
Help!

16:44.560 --> 16:46.225
Somebody!

16:47.440 --> 16:49.079
Help!

16:49.080 --> 16:51.919
Ernie, get your mother!
Quick!

16:55.480 --> 16:58.759
All right. I knew you weren't dead!

16:58.760 --> 17:01.519
Not yet I'm not!
Not you, Dad, him!

17:01.520 --> 17:03.743
Help!

17:03.800 --> 17:05.479
George, what...

17:09.440 --> 17:12.630
Are you all right?
Nancy, get my rifle, quick!

17:12.839 --> 17:14.743
What...
What are you...

17:14.839 --> 17:16.479
George!

17:19.079 --> 17:21.118
Sarah, don't come in here!

17:21.119 --> 17:24.598
Oh, my God!
Horrible smell!

17:24.599 --> 17:26.584
Nancy, do something!

17:28.800 --> 17:30.545
Be very careful.

17:40.640 --> 17:42.863
What are you doing?

17:44.800 --> 17:46.799
Oh, God!

17:46.800 --> 17:49.719
That's brilliant. Come on,
everybody, let's get out of here! Quick.

17:49.720 --> 17:51.704
Come on, Sarah.
No!

17:53.920 --> 17:56.621
Mom, my corsage!

17:56.720 --> 17:58.306
No.

17:59.120 --> 18:01.070
My orchid!

18:02.000 --> 18:05.239
It's eating
my fifteenth birthday corsage!

18:05.240 --> 18:05.954
Sarah!

18:05.955 --> 18:09.012
The one I saved for
over six whole months!

18:14.720 --> 18:16.999
I was gonna keep that flower

18:17.000 --> 18:19.302
for the rest of my life!

18:19.680 --> 18:23.239
And you ate it!
Sarah!

18:23.240 --> 18:28.319
I don't care how big and
ugly and smelly you are.

18:28.320 --> 18:31.799
You just can't go around eating
other people's corsages!

18:31.800 --> 18:35.359
That was a bad thing you did!
A bad, bad thing!

18:35.360 --> 18:38.039
Do you hear me?
Even if you are an animal!

18:38.040 --> 18:42.061
You just can't go around
acting like one in this house!

18:47.200 --> 18:49.980
Let's get out of here, now!

18:52.880 --> 18:55.719
Boy, Sarah. You really pissed him off!
Shut up.

18:55.720 --> 18:57.749
Shh! Both of you!

19:01.240 --> 19:04.225
Come on, it's going
in the dining room!

19:22.880 --> 19:23.999
Wow!

19:24.000 --> 19:26.621
That's great, that's just great!

19:39.080 --> 19:42.862
George, he's eating my plant.
Look, he's eating my plants! No!

19:43.280 --> 19:46.060
He's eating my
<i>Passiflora coriaceas.</i>

19:47.280 --> 19:49.070
Stop that!

19:49.160 --> 19:50.950
Oh, God!

20:30.600 --> 20:32.106
Uh-oh.

20:44.280 --> 20:45.786
Oh, dear.

21:14.360 --> 21:16.549
Okay, that's it!

21:17.200 --> 21:20.583
George! Can't we
just call somebody?

21:24.000 --> 21:26.359
George, what's that for?
I know what I'm doing.

21:26.360 --> 21:27.959
Oh, George!

21:27.960 --> 21:31.039
I'm not gonna stand around while
some animal destroys our house!

21:31.040 --> 21:33.741
Dad, it's not an animal!

23:07.120 --> 23:08.660
George?

23:24.160 --> 23:25.586
George?

23:27.000 --> 23:28.631
I'm okay.

23:36.280 --> 23:38.867
Everybody, get up here!
Quick! Quick!

23:46.080 --> 23:48.223
What's it doing?

23:50.120 --> 23:52.866
It's burying Grandma's mink stole.

23:56.280 --> 23:58.867
Don't you look at me like that!

24:04.040 --> 24:06.199
Why are you all
looking at me like that?

24:06.200 --> 24:11.079
I didn't kill the poor little things.
Grandma didn't kill them!

24:11.080 --> 24:14.623
Some ranchers raised them
and killed them.

24:14.960 --> 24:19.390
And they only did that because
they knew somebody would buy them.

24:19.400 --> 24:23.068
Come on, quick, everybody
back into the house!

24:32.800 --> 24:34.159
All right, everybody out!

24:42.560 --> 24:44.100
Uh-Oh.

24:44.560 --> 24:48.119
Keep an eye on him!
"Keep an eye on him," George?

24:48.120 --> 24:50.343
Lock the door!
Yeah.

24:53.200 --> 24:55.229
George, he's coming back!

24:55.720 --> 24:58.279
Stall him!
I can't! How?

24:58.280 --> 25:01.663
I don't know!
Show him the pasta maker.

25:15.880 --> 25:17.989
George!

25:20.800 --> 25:23.467
Not yet!
George!

25:24.560 --> 25:27.227
He really wants to come in now.

25:34.800 --> 25:36.261
George!

25:37.800 --> 25:39.431
Company!

25:43.200 --> 25:47.279
Downtown. Sergeant Mancini.
Sergeant, my name is George Henderson.

25:47.280 --> 25:49.159
I'm at 437 Manning Drive.

25:49.160 --> 25:51.224
I wanna report a...

25:53.120 --> 25:54.679
Something in my house.

25:54.680 --> 25:56.839
<i>What kind of something,
Mr. Henderson?</i>

25:56.840 --> 26:00.542
Some... A big... Something.

26:01.160 --> 26:04.191
My family's in terrible danger.
In danger?

26:04.200 --> 26:06.679
Mr. Henderson, do you have
someone in your house?

26:06.680 --> 26:08.519
<i>A burglar, a prowler?</i>

26:08.520 --> 26:11.471
No, don't think I'm crazy,
Sergeant,

26:12.880 --> 26:14.511
but it's Bigfoot.

26:15.480 --> 26:19.626
Of course, yes.
They can be a nuisance,

26:21.440 --> 26:22.999
<i>I'll tell you what,
Mr. Henderson.</i>

26:23.000 --> 26:24.799
<i>It kind of happens
all the time around here.</i>

26:24.800 --> 26:28.199
<i>Now, we found these Bigfeet
are pretty reasonable fellows.</i>

26:28.200 --> 26:29.501
Hey!

26:32.680 --> 26:36.439
Look, I hit a Bigfoot with my car.
I thought it was dead.

26:36.440 --> 26:38.199
I was gonna call in the morning,

26:38.200 --> 26:40.199
but it must have been hungry
'cause I found it in the kitchen!

26:40.200 --> 26:42.319
<i>You hit a Bigfoot with your car...</i>
No! Yes.

26:42.320 --> 26:43.759
<i>in your kitchen.</i>

26:43.760 --> 26:45.479
Look, I'm under
a lot of stress here,

26:45.480 --> 26:48.239
I mean, it wasn't dead anymore. It must
have just walked into the kitchen.

26:48.240 --> 26:49.839
It was eating
out of our refrigerator.

26:49.840 --> 26:53.359
I thought it was gonna eat me, but it
ate my daughter's corsage instead.

26:53.360 --> 26:56.999
And then our <i>Passiflora coriacea</i>
and then it ate our goldfish.

26:57.000 --> 26:59.587
And where is it now, Mr. Henderson?

27:01.240 --> 27:03.190
It's in the bathroom.

27:03.840 --> 27:06.268
Of course, how stupid of me.

27:06.720 --> 27:10.959
Hey, look, just say I believe you
have a Bigfoot in your house.

27:10.960 --> 27:13.159
First we cordon off
your neighborhood.

27:13.160 --> 27:15.119
Second, we evacuate your neighbors,

27:15.120 --> 27:17.479
and third, we send a whole
shit-load of cops in there

27:17.480 --> 27:21.039
<i>to deal with the thing. I mean, fully
armed and ready, Mr. Henderson.</i>

27:21.040 --> 27:22.599
<i>So unless you wanna be responsible</i>

27:22.600 --> 27:25.279
<i>for wrongfully turning your
neighborhood into a war zone</i>

27:25.280 --> 27:27.879
I suggest you drop this
whole thing right now.

27:27.880 --> 27:29.545
A war zone?

27:30.400 --> 27:31.559
Very well, then.

27:31.560 --> 27:35.865
No, no, no Bigfoot here,
Sergeant. I was just joking.

27:36.080 --> 27:37.479
Sorry, it's just a prank.

27:37.480 --> 27:41.580
I'm not even George Henderson. You
must have reached the wrong number.

27:43.760 --> 27:45.710
We're on our own.

27:48.680 --> 27:51.221
No, no, Sergeant, no Bigfoot here.

27:52.960 --> 27:54.500
Irene.

27:55.000 --> 27:57.268
Fine. Wonderful time.

27:57.600 --> 28:00.028
What? No, wait!

28:01.440 --> 28:02.759
It's Irene!

28:02.760 --> 28:04.639
She's bringing the dog back.
I couldn't stop her!

28:04.640 --> 28:05.839
I'll meet her halfway.

28:05.840 --> 28:07.919
Nance!

28:07.920 --> 28:10.239
It's no use hiding!
I know you're up!

28:10.240 --> 28:12.279
Just take Little Bob
and get rid of her!

28:12.280 --> 28:16.062
Easy for you to say. This is Irene.
Oh, my God!

28:17.040 --> 28:19.199
Look, we can't
let her see this thing.

28:19.200 --> 28:21.707
No offense.
The basement.

28:22.040 --> 28:25.822
You'll love it. It's like
a cave with a pool table.

28:27.960 --> 28:29.944
Come on!
Nancy!

28:30.040 --> 28:31.501
Nancy!

28:36.280 --> 28:37.479
Beat it!

28:37.480 --> 28:39.430
Come on, hurry!

28:40.520 --> 28:42.868
Nancy! Yoo-hoo!

28:44.400 --> 28:45.479
Quick, quick!

28:45.480 --> 28:48.181
Let's go! Now's our chance!

28:48.840 --> 28:50.319
Nancy, what...

28:50.320 --> 28:52.759
This is it!
The beginning of the end.

28:52.760 --> 28:55.719
Once Irene sees it,
the whole world's gonna know.

28:55.720 --> 28:58.039
I'll have to join a convent.
Nancy!

28:58.040 --> 28:59.479
Marry a zoo-keeper.

28:59.480 --> 29:02.319
I'll be a social outcast
for the rest of my life!

29:02.320 --> 29:05.319
I'll go to my prom, the kids will
probably throw pig blood on me!

29:05.320 --> 29:07.199
Thank you, Dad.
Sarah, don't let her in!

29:07.200 --> 29:09.719
Come on, big guy.
Rise and shine!

29:09.720 --> 29:13.866
Don't worry.
It's the safest place in the whole house!

29:19.720 --> 29:20.879
Ernie!

29:20.880 --> 29:22.639
It's okay, Mom, the stairs broke!

29:22.640 --> 29:24.159
We're all right.

29:24.160 --> 29:26.064
Oh, good.

29:27.760 --> 29:30.222
There you are!

29:30.680 --> 29:33.904
Amazing. That was...
Can you imagine?

29:35.400 --> 29:40.706
Little Bob must be in heat or something.
Every dog in the neighborhood is out here.

29:46.880 --> 29:48.511
My God!

29:48.720 --> 29:50.749
What is that smell?

29:58.200 --> 30:00.389
What the hell happened?

30:00.560 --> 30:03.784
We decided to defrost the fridge.

30:04.080 --> 30:05.870
Oh, God!

30:13.440 --> 30:16.027
Is everything all right
with you kids?

30:16.080 --> 30:17.519
Us?
Oh, hey, fine.

30:17.520 --> 30:20.061
Wonderful.
No. Great. Really great.

30:22.160 --> 30:23.639
I got your mail.

30:23.640 --> 30:26.068
Just put it on the fridge.

30:27.880 --> 30:31.519
Nan, you wouldn't happen to have any
peanut butter and brewer's yeast?

30:31.520 --> 30:32.959
I found a new diet.

30:32.960 --> 30:35.039
Sarah, please take
the dog out of the room.

30:35.040 --> 30:38.999
Peanut butter I know we have.
Is chunky okay?

30:39.000 --> 30:40.759
Let me see if I can
help you, Irene.

30:40.760 --> 30:42.919
Peanut butter's always
on the second shelf.

30:42.920 --> 30:44.919
Great. No brewer's yeast?
No, sorry.

30:44.920 --> 30:46.399
Never mind,
I gotta go to the market

30:46.400 --> 30:48.839
and pick up some
cod liver oil and Tabasco.

30:48.840 --> 30:52.269
It's a new energy diet. You
might wanna try it, George.

30:55.280 --> 30:59.426
Exercise, Irene.
That's the only diet.

30:59.760 --> 31:02.222
Plenty of energy right here!

31:06.480 --> 31:09.599
Well, maybe it's just rotten
meat or eggs or something.

31:09.600 --> 31:11.839
Exactly. No sense standing
around breathing it.

31:11.840 --> 31:14.759
Thank you for
taking care of Little Bob.

31:14.760 --> 31:15.879
Oh! Ernie!

31:15.880 --> 31:17.439
What was that?

31:17.440 --> 31:19.479
Ernie's experiment
for his science class.

31:19.480 --> 31:22.119
He's got one of those gerbils.

31:22.120 --> 31:24.599
Yeah! It's so cute.

31:24.600 --> 31:26.639
Only, it's more like...

31:26.640 --> 31:27.959
A hamster.

31:27.960 --> 31:32.345
Yeah, only bigger,
and it's always hungry.

31:33.600 --> 31:37.519
Nothing more than rats getting a lucky
shake from society, if you ask me.

31:37.520 --> 31:40.159
I know where you are if I need you.

31:40.160 --> 31:41.586
Ernie!

31:42.560 --> 31:44.589
Ernie, are you all right?

31:45.200 --> 31:47.628
Boy, is this guy strong!

31:49.120 --> 31:52.742
Ernie, give me your arms.
I'll lift you up.

32:16.520 --> 32:19.399
It's Monday morning.
What am I gonna do about work?

32:19.400 --> 32:22.679
You are going to call in sick,

32:22.680 --> 32:25.519
that's what you're
going to do about work.

32:25.520 --> 32:27.159
Dad's gonna just love that.

32:27.160 --> 32:28.959
Can I be sick, too?
No.

32:28.960 --> 32:31.719
I think you and Sarah will
be safer at school, Ernie.

32:31.720 --> 32:34.519
Oh, well. At least I can
tell the kids at school

32:34.520 --> 32:36.799
my dad creamed a Bigfoot.

32:36.800 --> 32:39.501
You're sick, too.
We're all sick.

32:40.200 --> 32:42.559
No one's going anywhere until
I figure out what to do!

32:42.560 --> 32:44.783
Get out of the fridge, Ernie.

32:46.720 --> 32:48.067
Coffee?

32:51.880 --> 32:54.990
Now, it took some doing, but...

32:55.600 --> 32:58.301
At least for now
it seems to be trapped.

33:02.880 --> 33:04.306
It's okay!

33:09.720 --> 33:12.068
So, how are you doing?

33:41.400 --> 33:44.599
I don't know.
He's our little pet.

34:21.440 --> 34:23.071
It's hurt.

34:36.600 --> 34:39.518
Are we sure we don't have
anything that doesn't sting?

34:39.520 --> 34:41.239
Don't I wish.

34:41.239 --> 34:45.279
Yeah, this is going
to hurt a little, okay?

34:45.280 --> 34:49.027
What I do is just close my
eyes real tight. Like this.

34:50.199 --> 34:51.559
All right. Okay.

34:56.679 --> 34:58.061
Good.

34:58.840 --> 35:01.279
Does this mean we can keep him?

35:01.280 --> 35:02.820
Oh, grow up!

35:03.040 --> 35:05.661
Maybe we can.
I don't know.

35:05.760 --> 35:07.159
You don't know?

35:07.160 --> 35:10.159
The answer is "No."
Now you know.

35:10.160 --> 35:12.399
It was just so different
when it was dead.

35:12.400 --> 35:14.907
George, you were different.

35:15.040 --> 35:17.639
And I'm convinced he wasn't dead.

35:17.640 --> 35:21.422
Hey, hang on. I thought we were
gonna sell it, and get rich.

35:21.760 --> 35:25.587
Let's keep it and get rich.
Exactly.

35:25.720 --> 35:29.502
I don't believe this family! Sorry.

35:30.000 --> 35:33.702
We are talking about a living,
breathing being here.

35:34.040 --> 35:37.199
It might even be
some kind of a person.

35:37.200 --> 35:39.343
It's a Bigfoot person.

35:40.000 --> 35:42.223
We don't even know what it is.

35:45.640 --> 35:48.039
We don't know
if it's male or female.

35:48.040 --> 35:49.439
Definitely male.

35:49.440 --> 35:51.390
How can you tell?

35:51.800 --> 35:53.239
Oh, don't answer that, honey.
Never mind.

35:53.240 --> 35:56.719
Nan, I don't know how, but we gotta
figure a way to keep this thing.

35:56.720 --> 35:58.919
It's big bucks, don't you see?

35:58.920 --> 36:01.519
I mean, it's a ticket
to a better life!

36:01.520 --> 36:04.559
A better life for whom?
What about his life?

36:04.560 --> 36:06.703
I'm thinking about us.

36:07.640 --> 36:10.546
I just need time
to figure away to...

36:11.520 --> 36:13.060
Oh, well.

36:13.320 --> 36:15.588
At least he's safe here.

36:16.480 --> 36:19.704
You should not have
given up, my old friend.

36:21.680 --> 36:23.799
The only difference
between these and those

36:23.800 --> 36:26.239
is I get a buck a strand for mine.

36:26.240 --> 36:28.269
These are real, Doc.

36:28.400 --> 36:30.999
I chased a set of tracks
for two or three miles.

36:31.000 --> 36:34.747
Okay, Jocko, if you've got
castings, I'll buy them,

36:35.080 --> 36:36.559
but let's keep the price
on the ground.

36:36.560 --> 36:38.749
Listen, you don't understand!

36:39.040 --> 36:42.799
I almost had him.
I was that close.

36:42.800 --> 36:45.341
Then what, gun jam?

36:45.640 --> 36:47.749
Or maybe a change of heart.

36:47.960 --> 36:49.879
Had him in your sights
and couldn't do it?

36:49.880 --> 36:52.786
What's the story this time?
I don't know.

36:52.880 --> 36:55.559
I think he was hit by a car.

36:55.560 --> 36:57.439
That should have made it easy.

36:57.440 --> 36:58.919
Yes, I know but...

36:58.920 --> 37:01.559
There are no traces,
no tracks, nothing.

37:01.560 --> 37:05.023
He just vanished.

37:05.800 --> 37:08.359
Well, like I tell my customers,

37:08.360 --> 37:10.549
Bigfoot eat their dead.

37:10.720 --> 37:12.319
I don't know why the
hell I bother with you!

37:12.320 --> 37:14.159
Because you figure I'm the only one

37:14.160 --> 37:15.959
who deep down wants to believe you,

37:15.960 --> 37:19.150
but I don't.
Not any more.

37:19.640 --> 37:22.639
We both spent our whole lives
chasing after that beast,

37:22.640 --> 37:25.119
and we both have to stare at
ourselves in the mirror every morning

37:25.120 --> 37:27.479
and keep repeating,
"I'm not a fool!"

37:27.480 --> 37:29.828
"I am not a fool!"

37:30.120 --> 37:31.879
Only you finally blinked!

37:31.880 --> 37:34.228
Or finally opened my eyes!

37:35.160 --> 37:37.462
We'll find out soon enough!

37:41.520 --> 37:45.063
Go for it, Jocko!
Raise a ruckus!

37:45.600 --> 37:48.141
God knows, I can use the business.

37:50.480 --> 37:52.987
Put the stuff
in the freezer, honey.

37:53.160 --> 37:55.542
Where is he?
Living room.

37:56.200 --> 38:00.027
Everything is melting. Have I
got something to show you.

38:00.280 --> 38:02.039
George, give me a second.

38:02.040 --> 38:04.759
Irene had us cornered out
there for 15 minutes.

38:04.760 --> 38:08.279
She invited us to dinner and bowling.
Bowling?

38:08.280 --> 38:10.319
Don't worry, George, I spared you.

38:10.320 --> 38:13.319
I told her you had something to
drop off tonight, don't you?

38:13.320 --> 38:14.439
Don't be so sure.

38:14.440 --> 38:17.639
You might just change your mind
when you've seen what I've seen.

38:17.640 --> 38:19.704
Sarah, you, too.
Come on.

38:23.840 --> 38:27.279
George, those are
just empty calories.

38:27.280 --> 38:30.345
Never mind about that.
No, no, no, no.

38:30.360 --> 38:32.662
Not yet.
Just a minute.

38:33.080 --> 38:35.399
I have a little something
to show you.

38:35.400 --> 38:39.466
But first, I want you to think
about this just for a moment.

38:40.320 --> 38:41.667
<i>Us,</i>

38:43.720 --> 38:45.146
<i>Life,</i>

38:45.960 --> 38:47.386
<i>Time.</i>

38:47.760 --> 38:49.479
Magazines! Cover stories.

38:49.480 --> 38:53.599
I mean, you could be looking at old Dad
on the <i>Carson Show</i>, for heaven's sake.

38:53.600 --> 38:55.186
No, no, no, no.

38:55.400 --> 38:58.590
Now, we started with
something kind of simple.

38:58.600 --> 39:00.239
But I'm sure you'll see

39:00.240 --> 39:04.750
that as soon as he gets going there
is absolutely nothing to stop him!

39:06.080 --> 39:07.541
Sit.

39:09.640 --> 39:11.021
Sit.

39:12.920 --> 39:14.267
Sit!

39:19.240 --> 39:23.306
That's great!
You taught him how to sit?

39:27.440 --> 39:28.799
No, no, no!

39:28.800 --> 39:30.590
Don't sit!

39:32.240 --> 39:35.111
That was outstanding, Dad!

39:35.640 --> 39:39.262
No, no, no. Stay. Please...

39:41.120 --> 39:46.301
George, if I could have a word with
you before the Carson Show calls.

39:48.520 --> 39:49.821
Nancy!

39:49.880 --> 39:51.119
It wasn't...

39:51.120 --> 39:53.199
Nancy, honey, we've got to
give him one more chance!

39:53.200 --> 39:57.199
George Nathan Henderson,
what is the matter with you?

39:57.200 --> 40:00.759
This is our home! Our stuff!

40:00.760 --> 40:02.959
Look, he had it perfect
just five minutes ago.

40:02.960 --> 40:05.559
George, you are acting
like a crazy person!

40:05.560 --> 40:07.399
Honey, that wasn't
supposed to happen!

40:07.400 --> 40:09.479
None of this was
supposed to happen,

40:09.480 --> 40:12.479
but it did, and now we have
to do the right thing!

40:12.480 --> 40:15.679
I know it seems bad, but
just give me one more week.

40:15.680 --> 40:18.119
We don't have enough house
for two days!

40:18.120 --> 40:21.719
George, he doesn't fit here!
He doesn't fit in our lives!

40:21.720 --> 40:25.839
Look, we have to do the right
thing and think about him!

40:25.840 --> 40:28.119
Mom, Dad, hurry, this is great!

40:30.120 --> 40:31.679
<i>What's the matter with him?</i>

40:31.680 --> 40:33.479
<i>Maybe he thinks you're getting...</i>

40:35.480 --> 40:37.305
Now watch this.

40:43.600 --> 40:44.719
Cool, huh?

40:44.720 --> 40:46.359
He didn't care for the blue cheese.

40:46.360 --> 40:48.662
<i>eat your Pablum
like a good boy...</i>

40:53.520 --> 40:55.879
<i>and you'll have
Swedish pancake too.</i>

40:55.880 --> 40:57.879
<i>Now I know where
Bonzo get his bad habits.</i>

40:57.880 --> 40:59.864
<i>That's outright bribery.</i>

41:05.040 --> 41:07.229
Okay.
I'll take him back.

41:08.240 --> 41:11.159
But you know
it might not be so easy,

41:11.160 --> 41:13.462
I think he likes it here.

41:14.960 --> 41:17.239
<i>What kind of a way
is that to talk to a baby?</i>

41:17.240 --> 41:18.701
<i>What do you mean?</i>

41:27.240 --> 41:29.622
She's gone.
It's time to go.

41:34.240 --> 41:37.350
Remember this?
Your favorite station wagon.

41:37.400 --> 41:40.399
Right. What's left of it.

41:42.160 --> 41:43.239
No, no, no.

41:43.240 --> 41:46.544
It's really much nicer
on the inside. Come on.

41:55.360 --> 41:56.661
Perfect.

41:58.840 --> 42:01.239
Hungry? We're gonna
have a little party.

42:01.240 --> 42:03.588
Yeah. A goodbye party.

42:10.680 --> 42:12.744
Plan B.
No problem.

42:18.920 --> 42:21.541
See what we're gonna be missing?

42:22.120 --> 42:24.582
Never mind.
Let's eat. Nancy?

42:24.640 --> 42:26.101
Here. Ern.

42:26.600 --> 42:28.664
Have you ever had a burger?

42:30.480 --> 42:32.191
Smells good.

42:32.960 --> 42:34.199
Look at this.

42:34.200 --> 42:35.786
Mmm. Mmm.

42:50.080 --> 42:51.559
Oh, right.

42:51.560 --> 42:53.799
Yours was the fish. Here.

42:53.800 --> 42:55.670
This is for him,

42:56.680 --> 42:58.982
the burgers are for you.

42:59.000 --> 43:01.621
You want another?
I ordered wrong.

43:01.720 --> 43:04.148
Double fish on a sesame bun.

43:05.320 --> 43:07.304
Catch of the day.

43:08.640 --> 43:11.102
Covered with tartar sauce.

43:16.880 --> 43:19.228
How about some fries, huh?

43:19.600 --> 43:22.631
Extra larges, two orders.

43:26.840 --> 43:29.666
You can wash it down
with a chocolate shake.

43:31.520 --> 43:33.663
Look at all this stuff!

43:34.480 --> 43:36.623
All you can eat.

43:39.640 --> 43:41.510
Atta boy.

43:45.800 --> 43:47.431
Great!

43:49.680 --> 43:51.550
Comfortable?

44:13.000 --> 44:15.871
Just sit... Stay.

44:15.880 --> 44:17.306
Stay.

44:17.640 --> 44:19.590
Stay right there.

44:20.400 --> 44:23.385
You're not changing
your mind, are you?

44:33.640 --> 44:35.908
Your mom's right, Ern.

44:36.280 --> 44:39.345
I know it's hard.
It's hard for me, too.

44:40.080 --> 44:42.747
But it's the right thing to do.

44:45.880 --> 44:50.344
It was wrong of me to think that we
could just claim it like a stray dog.

44:51.280 --> 44:53.279
He's more of a man than an animal.

44:53.280 --> 44:55.469
You were the first one to see that.

44:56.160 --> 44:58.383
He deserves to be free.

45:00.520 --> 45:02.265
Mom's right.

45:02.760 --> 45:05.267
He's gotta go back
where he belongs.

45:05.320 --> 45:07.987
So why don't you and me

45:08.240 --> 45:11.350
go on down there,
like a couple of real men

45:13.160 --> 45:16.999
and say, "Goodbye, hairy friend."

45:18.280 --> 45:19.786
Harry?

45:20.040 --> 45:22.661
Since when does he have a name?

45:24.640 --> 45:26.590
Since right now.

45:55.160 --> 45:56.586
Harry.

46:07.960 --> 46:10.991
Harry!

46:24.560 --> 46:28.159
There's someone in the house.
What should we do?

46:28.160 --> 46:30.303
You stay right there.

47:45.040 --> 47:48.119
<i>Good morning, Seattle.
Today Jerry's special...</i>

47:48.120 --> 47:51.629
You're free, Little Bob.
Go back to the wild.

47:52.480 --> 47:54.430
Run, Little Bob.

47:55.120 --> 47:56.581
Run free.

48:01.280 --> 48:03.799
<i>And now, your host,</i>

48:03.800 --> 48:06.719
<i>the toast of
the Olympic Coast,</i>

48:06.720 --> 48:09.399
<i>Jerry Seville!</i>

48:09.400 --> 48:12.624
<i>Thank you,
thank you, thank you.</i>

48:15.120 --> 48:17.263
<i>Good morning, Seattle.</i>

48:18.080 --> 48:19.799
God, I hate this guy.

48:19.800 --> 48:23.309
I'll turn it off.
No. Let me hate him.

48:23.360 --> 48:25.519
It'll keep me awake
until the coffee kicks in.

48:25.520 --> 48:27.479
<i>But I sure am glad
it's Tuesday.</i>

48:27.480 --> 48:30.239
<i>Isn't Monday
the dullest day of the week?</i>

48:30.240 --> 48:32.879
Up yours, Jerry.

48:32.880 --> 48:35.387
<i>Seems old Jer was wrong.</i>

48:35.840 --> 48:38.461
<i>All right.
This morning's paper.</i>

48:39.000 --> 48:42.065
<i>By no means front page news.</i>

48:43.360 --> 48:44.999
<i>Are you sitting down?</i>

48:45.000 --> 48:49.021
<i>Listen, late last night
a Hawthorne Hills man</i>

48:49.360 --> 48:54.461
<i>discovered his wife lying
unconscious on top of their car.</i>

48:55.480 --> 48:59.359
<i>After the paramedics had
revived the woman she said,</i>

48:59.360 --> 49:04.279
<i>"She must have been put there by
a huge, hairy, man-like creature</i>

49:04.280 --> 49:07.919
<i>"resembling the legendary Bigfoot...</i>
Harry.

49:07.920 --> 49:11.110
<i>"...who she had earlier
mistaken for a mouse!"</i>

49:11.680 --> 49:13.759
Hawthorne Hills?

49:13.760 --> 49:15.519
A mouse?
<i>A mouse!</i>

49:15.520 --> 49:17.359
I gotta find him.
I can't go to work.

49:17.360 --> 49:20.879
When do we ever listen to
silly old Jerry Seville?

49:20.880 --> 49:24.479
<i>If there really was a Bigfoot, don't you think
I'd have had him as a guest on my show?</i>

49:24.480 --> 49:25.599
I gotta check it out anyway.

49:25.600 --> 49:28.239
No, the very best thing that
you can do is go to work.

49:28.240 --> 49:30.839
What if somebody finds him before I...
All right?

49:30.840 --> 49:33.711
See you tonight.
Bye-bye. Bye.

49:33.760 --> 49:38.702
<i>John Morrow, who will talk to us all
about his new squid and prune juice diet.</i>

49:38.720 --> 49:40.119
<i>Bigfoot.</i>

49:40.120 --> 49:42.070
Mom, he came back!

49:44.400 --> 49:46.350
Little Bob!

49:56.360 --> 49:58.039
It's amazing, you know,

49:58.040 --> 50:00.639
I see an old Army buddy from 40
years driving along the freeway

50:00.640 --> 50:02.799
and, of course,
I cannot remember his name

50:02.800 --> 50:05.399
so I take his license number
plate and I come here,

50:05.400 --> 50:08.919
and because of that I am going to find
out where he lives. It's fantastic.

50:08.920 --> 50:10.551
Ten bucks.

50:16.960 --> 50:18.839
So how about you, George?

50:18.840 --> 50:20.759
Did you see any Bigfoot?
What?

50:20.760 --> 50:23.119
You know, your vacation.
Bigfoot?

50:23.120 --> 50:25.639
No.
I read the things weigh over 400 pounds.

50:25.640 --> 50:27.510
Smell real bad, too.

50:27.960 --> 50:30.911
Hell, looks like we got
one of those right here.

50:31.000 --> 50:34.349
What's your shoe size, Billers?
Very funny.

50:42.280 --> 50:44.582
I'm working with assholes.

50:48.360 --> 50:49.919
Can I help you?

50:49.920 --> 50:53.463
Probably yes.
I hope we can help each other.

50:53.920 --> 50:57.110
I believe this is yours.

50:59.440 --> 51:02.346
Okay, what are you
selling, buster, huh?

51:03.440 --> 51:06.346
Mrs. Henderson?
Yes.

51:07.200 --> 51:12.222
Irene, would you go see if the tea
kettle is just about to boil, honey?

51:12.400 --> 51:13.781
Thank you.

51:15.760 --> 51:17.799
Good morning.
Hi.

51:17.800 --> 51:20.467
I am called Richard Smith.

51:20.680 --> 51:22.679
And I'm from
the U.S. Forestry Service

51:22.680 --> 51:25.839
and I'm investigating a possible
road-kill, with an animal

51:25.840 --> 51:27.839
either killed or maimed
in a car accident.

51:27.840 --> 51:30.559
Now, I know that you did
hit something on Route A-4

51:30.560 --> 51:32.839
which was a little fire road
off the I-90?

51:32.840 --> 51:35.239
Yes. We did run into something.

51:36.600 --> 51:39.639
What was it that you hit,
Mrs. Henderson?

51:39.640 --> 51:41.359
I don't know.
We couldn't see it.

51:41.360 --> 51:43.119
You know, it happened so fast.

51:43.120 --> 51:44.879
Where is it now?

51:44.880 --> 51:47.501
Now? I don't know.
It ran away.

51:48.440 --> 51:51.399
Mrs. Henderson, obviously, our
main concern are for your family,

51:51.400 --> 51:53.879
to be sure no one was injured.

51:53.880 --> 51:57.024
No one was injured.
I'm so pleased.

51:57.360 --> 52:01.439
Obviously our other concern is for the
safety of that poor little animal.

52:01.440 --> 52:03.159
It could be out there suffering

52:03.160 --> 52:07.624
and I know you would want to help
me find it so I could care for it.

52:07.960 --> 52:11.039
No. I mean, yes.

52:11.040 --> 52:12.279
But I mean,
there's nothing wrong with it.

52:12.280 --> 52:14.919
It walked into the woods.
I mean, it didn't even limp.

52:14.920 --> 52:16.426
Walked?

52:18.000 --> 52:22.279
It crawled, it scurried,
you know, it scampered,

52:22.280 --> 52:27.222
it kind of wobbled, creeped,
like an animal does, you know?

52:27.320 --> 52:30.430
Anyway, he's fine,
and we are fine and...

52:30.560 --> 52:32.021
You know...

52:32.120 --> 52:36.159
I forgot I have a sink backed up and I...
And a potty.

52:36.160 --> 52:38.199
I've gotta go take care of it.
Thank you.

52:38.200 --> 52:41.759
Thanks very much for thinking
of us and bringing this to us.

52:41.760 --> 52:44.666
And thanks for your consideration.

52:49.920 --> 52:54.191
License plates, huh? That guy's
probably a convict. Here.

52:54.680 --> 52:56.719
What you don't need now
is somebody bothering you.

52:56.720 --> 52:59.022
Just sit back and relax.

53:02.080 --> 53:06.510
I can remember Herb's and my first fight.
This is nothing.

53:11.920 --> 53:14.119
Can I help you?
Probably not.

53:14.120 --> 53:16.519
This is the first
place I have been.

53:16.520 --> 53:18.822
I want some .458 magnums.

53:19.680 --> 53:22.711
I think we got those
in here somewhere.

53:24.080 --> 53:26.189
Yeah. Here we are.

53:27.360 --> 53:30.186
We don't get much
call for these monsters.

53:30.960 --> 53:32.591
$28.50 for the box.

53:37.640 --> 53:39.719
Do you have any more?

53:39.720 --> 53:42.671
There's 20 of them in there,
you know?

53:42.680 --> 53:44.789
Do you have any more?

53:48.480 --> 53:51.511
I'm sorry, that's the last we got.

53:51.760 --> 53:53.839
What, are you going
on safari or something?

53:53.840 --> 53:56.461
No. Just into my own back yard.

54:08.560 --> 54:11.181
There he goes, just like clockwork.

54:11.680 --> 54:14.870
Jeez, Dad,
who the hell is that guy?

54:15.040 --> 54:16.799
Jacques LaFleur.

54:16.800 --> 54:20.999
He's always the first to show when
these crazy sightings start up.

54:21.000 --> 54:24.144
He bought some
pretty serious ammo, .458s.

54:24.720 --> 54:28.547
Before Sasquatch got under his
skin he was a Class A hunter.

54:28.840 --> 54:31.666
Where do you think Claws came from?

54:32.520 --> 54:34.743
That guy shot Claws?
Yeah.

54:34.840 --> 54:37.159
Why would he part
with a trophy like that?

54:37.160 --> 54:40.270
Probably because
it was the smallest one.

54:41.520 --> 54:43.119
May I help you?

54:43.120 --> 54:45.679
Yes, I'm on my lunch break
and I'm kind of in a hurry.

54:45.680 --> 54:49.029
Could you point me
to some books on the...

54:50.040 --> 54:51.546
Bigfoot?

54:52.040 --> 54:53.439
Sasquatch?

54:53.440 --> 54:55.559
Sasquatch.
Sasquatch.

54:55.560 --> 54:56.599
That's the one.

54:56.600 --> 54:58.919
Fantasy, folklore,
myths and legends.

54:58.920 --> 55:01.826
Basement stacks. Take the stairs.
Thank you.

55:02.560 --> 55:05.591
You could also try children's books!
Right!

55:07.720 --> 55:10.399
This book sucks!
Ernie.

55:10.400 --> 55:12.519
These pictures don't look
anything like Harry!

55:12.520 --> 55:14.719
He's right, Nan. It's no
wonder people wanna kill them.

55:14.720 --> 55:17.439
These books make them
out to be monsters.

55:17.440 --> 55:22.239
All except this journal from the North
American Anthropological Institute.

55:22.240 --> 55:25.020
Some guy named Wallace Wrightwood.

55:25.240 --> 55:28.479
That's him.
No. That's Jacques LaFleur.

55:28.480 --> 55:30.559
He's a hunter who came
into the store today.

55:30.560 --> 55:32.519
No, honey.
This is Richard Smith,

55:32.520 --> 55:34.119
the forestry guy I told you about

55:34.120 --> 55:37.469
who came to our house today.

55:38.840 --> 55:42.199
- That lying bastard!
- Mom!

55:42.200 --> 55:43.239
Both of you, to bed, right now.

55:43.240 --> 55:45.759
Sarah, get off that phone. It's two hours.
Come on, that's it!

55:45.760 --> 55:49.303
Mom, it's only 8:30.
You mind your mother!

57:51.680 --> 57:53.789
Hard to believe, huh?

57:54.400 --> 57:57.359
And from the look in your mug, you
think it's a load, don't you?

57:57.360 --> 58:00.584
Everybody asks,
"Has anybody ever seen one?"

58:00.640 --> 58:02.239
Let me ask you,

58:02.240 --> 58:05.862
you being a flatlander,
a city fellow,

58:05.960 --> 58:08.919
you've seen hundreds,
thousands of pigeons, right?

58:08.920 --> 58:12.224
Of course.
Have you ever seen a baby pigeon?

58:13.640 --> 58:15.559
Well, neither have I.

58:15.560 --> 58:18.067
But I got a hunch they exist.

58:18.200 --> 58:21.424
Are you Dr. Wrightwood?
I'm George Henderson.

58:21.480 --> 58:23.669
Wrightwood ain't here.

58:24.320 --> 58:26.639
Is he coming back?
He might.

58:26.640 --> 58:28.439
Could I leave a message for...

58:28.440 --> 58:30.868
How do you know Wrightwood?

58:30.920 --> 58:33.746
His books. And his research.

58:33.800 --> 58:37.519
He seems to be the only person
who really believes in all this.

58:37.520 --> 58:39.868
I just need a few answers.

58:40.240 --> 58:42.269
Doctor's old, tired.

58:42.760 --> 58:46.279
I'm gonna put
my phone number down here.

58:46.280 --> 58:49.311
Could you see
that the Doctor gets this?

58:49.440 --> 58:54.906
"Vital facts that could prevent
an unnecessary and tragic end

58:54.960 --> 58:57.149
"for the big fellow?"

58:58.840 --> 59:00.319
I have a friend,

59:00.320 --> 59:03.703
a man named Jack.

59:04.080 --> 59:08.146
And say there was this,
this, giant...

59:08.200 --> 59:12.107
ls there a beanstalk involved
in this, Mr. Henderson?

59:12.800 --> 59:14.511
A beanstalk?

59:16.040 --> 59:17.319
No. No.

59:17.320 --> 59:22.103
I mean, with all
these Bigfoot sightings

59:22.480 --> 59:25.919
what if Jack and his family

59:25.920 --> 59:27.984
opened up their home

59:28.200 --> 59:31.310
and their lives to this thing?

59:31.480 --> 59:34.919
And, what if they found out that
he was more human than animal,

59:34.920 --> 59:36.839
and they just said,
"We'll take him in.

59:36.840 --> 59:42.306
"We'll accept responsibility for him until
a safe place can be found for him to be."

59:42.960 --> 59:44.679
Not some zoo, or lab...

59:44.680 --> 59:47.679
So what you're saying is
you would be willing...

59:47.680 --> 59:50.279
Excuse me, Jack would be willing
to take this creature in,

59:50.280 --> 59:52.981
care for it and love it like a pet?
No, no,

59:53.640 --> 59:56.039
like a member of the family.

59:56.040 --> 59:58.439
That's a noble gesture,
but impossible.

59:58.440 --> 01:00:01.839
Sasquatch is a primitive
ancestor of modern man,

01:00:01.840 --> 01:00:03.639
but if you ever came
face to face with one

01:00:03.640 --> 01:00:05.959
you'd see that they're still
very much animals.

01:00:05.960 --> 01:00:07.319
Only on the outside.

01:00:07.320 --> 01:00:08.759
Look, I know what
I'm talking about!

01:00:08.760 --> 01:00:13.145
And I know it's closing time so if
you wanna talk shop, then shop!

01:00:27.640 --> 01:00:29.719
<i>Jack and the Beanstalk,</i>
George?

01:00:29.720 --> 01:00:33.319
It just came out like that. I
didn't know what I was saying.

01:00:33.320 --> 01:00:36.399
I think you knew
exactly what you were saying.

01:00:36.400 --> 01:00:38.959
Face it, Dad, you want him back.

01:00:38.960 --> 01:00:41.359
Sarah, I want to take him back
where he belongs,

01:00:41.360 --> 01:00:43.399
but that means
I've gotta find him first.

01:00:43.400 --> 01:00:45.519
By bringing Harry here
we put his life in danger.

01:00:45.520 --> 01:00:48.239
Now, we've got to
try to set things right.

01:00:48.240 --> 01:00:49.746
George,

01:00:50.280 --> 01:00:52.389
this is really Harry.

01:00:59.600 --> 01:01:01.868
Did you draw that?
Yeah.

01:01:02.240 --> 01:01:04.463
It's beautiful.

01:02:19.280 --> 01:02:22.359
Hey! Hey, fella, get away
from that window!

01:02:34.160 --> 01:02:36.542
He's the person who saw it.

01:02:50.120 --> 01:02:51.199
Now get this.

01:02:51.200 --> 01:02:55.559
"It must have been the large hairy
giant he saw running from the scene."

01:02:55.560 --> 01:02:57.624
Did you get that, George?

01:02:57.680 --> 01:02:58.981
Yeah.

01:03:00.320 --> 01:03:04.670
George, do you still
fool with that painting stuff?

01:03:05.040 --> 01:03:06.341
Yeah.

01:03:07.040 --> 01:03:08.999
As a matter of fact, I...
Good!

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:11.199
You can save your old man
a few bucks.

01:03:11.200 --> 01:03:15.266
How about you draw
a big full-size Bigfoot?

01:03:16.240 --> 01:03:19.439
We'll put it in the window
right next to the gun section.

01:03:19.440 --> 01:03:23.506
Now, you make him real big,
you know, real scary.

01:03:23.520 --> 01:03:26.426
You know, like they're
supposed to be, George.

01:03:26.680 --> 01:03:29.559
Hands up, big claws,

01:03:29.560 --> 01:03:33.039
big fangs, a lot of drool.

01:03:33.040 --> 01:03:35.679
And let's put up a map of the area,

01:03:35.680 --> 01:03:39.399
and we'll mark on it all the spots where
people say they've seen the thing.

01:03:39.400 --> 01:03:44.228
We'll become kind of like
a Bigfoot Central, a B.H.Q.

01:03:44.840 --> 01:03:47.919
Dad, don't you think we might be
encouraging a lot of unqualified people

01:03:47.920 --> 01:03:49.919
to go running around
with loaded weapons?

01:03:49.920 --> 01:03:53.827
Come on, you know as well as I do
there's nothing out there to shoot at.

01:04:22.040 --> 01:04:25.879
This is the first time my dad ever wanted
me to draw anything and what is it?

01:04:25.880 --> 01:04:29.263
A target for a bunch of
blood-thirsty crackpots.

01:04:29.480 --> 01:04:32.670
Come to bed.
No, really, it's the same old story.

01:04:33.120 --> 01:04:35.039
One Christmas, when I was a kid,

01:04:35.040 --> 01:04:38.423
I begged him all fall
for a set of paints.

01:04:38.640 --> 01:04:40.879
He ends up giving me a BB gun.

01:04:40.880 --> 01:04:42.944
Like you got Ernie.

01:04:45.640 --> 01:04:46.879
Yeah.

01:04:46.880 --> 01:04:48.479
Come to bed.
No.

01:04:48.480 --> 01:04:51.306
Honey, I can't.
I gotta finish this.

01:04:51.400 --> 01:04:53.429
What's the problem?

01:04:54.720 --> 01:04:56.919
If I make him look
mean and vicious,

01:04:56.920 --> 01:05:00.639
people are gonna shoot first and
then worry about the consequences.

01:05:00.640 --> 01:05:05.070
It's like drawing a "wanted"
poster of your best friend.

01:05:06.200 --> 01:05:10.983
But if I make him look peaceful,
the way Harry really is...

01:05:12.840 --> 01:05:15.746
Well, that's just not
what my father wants.

01:05:17.320 --> 01:05:19.748
George, I'm so proud of you.

01:05:20.560 --> 01:05:22.908
You don't know what to do.

01:05:25.080 --> 01:05:28.463
If your father wants a Bigfoot,

01:05:30.600 --> 01:05:32.664
give him a Bigfoot.

01:05:35.360 --> 01:05:39.551
I wanted King Kong, you brought
me a goddamn giant gerbil.

01:05:39.680 --> 01:05:41.839
I told you exactly what to do.
You didn't even come close.

01:05:41.840 --> 01:05:43.879
Well, maybe it's right on the nose.

01:05:43.880 --> 01:05:46.879
I mean, how do we know?
Maybe it's not vicious at all.

01:05:46.880 --> 01:05:50.159
Maybe it's gentle,
even has feelings.

01:05:50.160 --> 01:05:52.542
Where did you dream up that shit?

01:05:53.040 --> 01:05:56.981
Go stick a pin in Queen Anne's Hill,
we just got another sighting.

01:05:59.880 --> 01:06:02.103
Should have got a real artist.

01:06:08.040 --> 01:06:11.079
I need one of those
Clint Eastwood magnums.

01:06:11.080 --> 01:06:12.439
You got an M-16?

01:06:12.440 --> 01:06:13.799
Anything that'll go
fully automatic?

01:06:13.800 --> 01:06:17.479
Fully automatic is illegal and it
takes seven days to clear a handgun.

01:06:17.480 --> 01:06:20.879
I'm afraid if you want a gun right now
it'll have to be a rifle or a shotgun.

01:06:20.880 --> 01:06:22.759
Anything with a night-scope.

01:06:22.760 --> 01:06:24.199
Give me the biggest one you got!

01:06:24.200 --> 01:06:27.359
Well, we've got some big guns
and some big, big guns,

01:06:27.360 --> 01:06:30.479
but I'm afraid we're all out
of big, big ammo! Who's next?

01:06:30.480 --> 01:06:35.319
Look, pal, they just spotted that
thing not three blocks from my house.

01:06:35.320 --> 01:06:37.039
Where do you live?
What for?

01:06:37.040 --> 01:06:39.159
It's for the gun.
Where do you live?

01:06:39.160 --> 01:06:41.239
11484 Devon Drive.

01:06:41.240 --> 01:06:42.759
Where was the sighting?

01:06:42.760 --> 01:06:44.799
On the corner of Maple and Ogilvy.

01:06:44.800 --> 01:06:46.559
What the hell's
that got to do with it?

01:06:46.560 --> 01:06:47.639
Where you going?

01:06:47.640 --> 01:06:48.719
Son of a bitch!

01:06:52.920 --> 01:06:55.759
See? You're not
the only artist in the family.

01:06:55.760 --> 01:06:57.679
How's that for
an arthritic old shooter, huh?

01:06:57.680 --> 01:06:59.039
What the hell did you do that for?

01:06:59.040 --> 01:07:00.919
It was my drawing!
Why did you change it?

01:07:00.920 --> 01:07:03.279
Hey, George. Cool down.
It's just a piece of cardboard.

01:07:03.280 --> 01:07:04.439
Not to me!

01:07:04.440 --> 01:07:06.039
It means something to me!

01:07:06.040 --> 01:07:08.319
Can't you see that?
He means something to me!

01:07:08.320 --> 01:07:10.959
What the hell are you talking about?
The hell with it! I quit!

01:07:10.960 --> 01:07:14.469
Over this? You can't quit!
We've never been so busy!

01:07:14.680 --> 01:07:16.789
What the hell's
the matter with you?

01:07:34.200 --> 01:07:35.919
Harry.
Yeah.

01:07:35.920 --> 01:07:38.319
Sorry, thought
you were someone else.

01:07:38.320 --> 01:07:42.679
It was huge.
It was bigger than you are!

01:07:42.680 --> 01:07:46.359
Twice as big as you. Gigantic!
Biggest thing I ever saw.

01:07:46.360 --> 01:07:48.039
Excuse me,
when did all this happen?

01:07:48.040 --> 01:07:50.159
Do you mind? I'm trying
to take a statement.

01:07:50.160 --> 01:07:51.879
It was huge. Gigantic.

01:07:51.880 --> 01:07:56.159
A monster like an ape with rabies, only
bigger than a regular ape with rabies.

01:07:56.160 --> 01:07:58.759
Now just calm down and
tell me what happened.

01:07:58.760 --> 01:08:01.142
Okay. I'm okay.

01:08:01.840 --> 01:08:04.119
I brought my poor ten-speed
to a complete stop

01:08:04.120 --> 01:08:05.839
like I always do at stop signs.

01:08:05.840 --> 01:08:08.239
When out of nowhere
this humungous hairy thing

01:08:08.240 --> 01:08:11.020
is standing right
in front of me! Growling.

01:08:11.040 --> 01:08:15.039
With these enormous fangs and these
giant hands, and he grabs me.

01:08:15.040 --> 01:08:17.158
And he picks me up,
bike and all, over his head

01:08:17.160 --> 01:08:20.719
then he smashes me down on the
cement and now he's all over me.

01:08:20.720 --> 01:08:24.627
And he's snarling with saliva
dripping off his pointed teeth.

01:08:24.800 --> 01:08:25.999
So I grab my Mace...

01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:28.759
- What? Mace? You idiot!
- Stand back.

01:08:28.760 --> 01:08:30.799
I didn't really Mace him.
I was about to be eaten!

01:08:30.800 --> 01:08:33.559
Eaten? By a vegetarian?
All right, that's it. Officers!

01:08:33.560 --> 01:08:34.959
No, now look...

01:08:34.960 --> 01:08:36.479
I have no doubt that you saw him,

01:08:36.479 --> 01:08:38.279
but what really happened is
when you saw him,

01:08:38.279 --> 01:08:41.879
you were so scared shitless that you
crashed your precious ten speed

01:08:41.880 --> 01:08:43.839
into the stop sign,
bumped your head on the curb

01:08:43.840 --> 01:08:47.029
and probably scared him
half to death in the process!

01:08:47.319 --> 01:08:49.839
I'm right, aren't I? That's
what really happened, isn't it?

01:08:49.840 --> 01:08:51.505
Isn't it?

01:08:52.960 --> 01:08:56.184
Yes. Yes.

01:08:56.399 --> 01:08:58.359
How did you know this?
Did you witness it happen?

01:08:58.359 --> 01:09:00.559
What's your name, sir?
My name?

01:09:00.560 --> 01:09:01.719
My name is George Hen...

01:09:01.720 --> 01:09:04.705
George, George what?
George Hen...

01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:06.586
George what?

01:09:07.160 --> 01:09:10.559
I'm sorry.
I really have to go.

01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:27.439
<i>...the dreaded name of Bigfoot</i>

01:09:27.439 --> 01:09:29.390
<i>reverberated through newsrooms...</i>

<i>or the hairy visitor, should call
this station and report Bigfoot.</i>

01:11:14.240 --> 01:11:16.429
What the hell is that?

01:11:41.120 --> 01:11:43.866
I said get out of here now!

01:12:00.360 --> 01:12:02.025
Harry!

01:12:02.680 --> 01:12:04.220
Harry!

01:12:09.760 --> 01:12:13.719
I want this quadrant air tight.
Nothing gets out! Nothing!

01:12:13.720 --> 01:12:16.546
And no force except
in self-defense!

01:12:17.080 --> 01:12:18.959
I don't want some prankster
in a monkey suit

01:12:18.960 --> 01:12:20.750
bleeding all over the streets.

01:12:33.640 --> 01:12:35.239
<i>We have
civilians with weapons.</i>

01:12:35.240 --> 01:12:38.919
<i>All units in the vicinity of Broadway
and Torrance please respond.</i>

01:12:38.920 --> 01:12:41.879
<i>Repeat, we have civilians
with weapons.</i>

01:12:47.280 --> 01:12:49.150
Hey, you! Halt!

01:12:52.200 --> 01:12:55.822
Freeze! Move out!
Drop it!

01:12:56.440 --> 01:12:59.471
What, are you crazy? Do you know
how much I paid for this gun?

01:13:00.160 --> 01:13:03.782
Get this guy. Come on,
move it! Move it!

01:14:33.760 --> 01:14:35.789
My God! Harry?

01:14:48.440 --> 01:14:50.719
Harry, are you hurt?
Where are you?

01:14:53.240 --> 01:14:54.541
Harry.

01:14:55.960 --> 01:14:58.866
Thank God, you're okay!
Come on down!

01:15:01.600 --> 01:15:03.504
Stay right there!

01:15:04.600 --> 01:15:06.231
Don't move.

01:15:22.760 --> 01:15:24.630
Hang on, Harry.

01:15:35.240 --> 01:15:37.588
Follow that garbage truck!

01:17:04.080 --> 01:17:07.145
Harry! Harry,
come on down.

01:17:09.360 --> 01:17:12.345
There. Quick! This way!

01:17:31.600 --> 01:17:33.868
We did it!

01:17:51.600 --> 01:17:53.061
Nancy.

01:17:54.600 --> 01:17:55.901
Honey.

01:17:58.400 --> 01:18:00.270
Look who's here.

01:18:05.640 --> 01:18:07.351
Harry?

01:18:08.560 --> 01:18:10.146
Harry!

01:18:11.680 --> 01:18:13.311
Harry.

01:18:18.440 --> 01:18:21.879
I knew it was you. I could smell
you all the way upstairs.

01:18:21.880 --> 01:18:23.919
Wow! Let's celebrate!

01:18:23.920 --> 01:18:27.064
Let's take a picture!
I'll get the camera.

01:18:27.120 --> 01:18:28.660
Ernie, no! No!

01:18:41.040 --> 01:18:42.671
Harry,

01:18:43.640 --> 01:18:45.271
I'm human.

01:18:46.480 --> 01:18:48.350
I made a mistake

01:18:48.840 --> 01:18:50.710
and I'm sorry.

01:18:51.200 --> 01:18:53.662
Dad, he doesn't understand.

01:18:59.600 --> 01:19:02.028
I know something he'll understand.

01:19:02.120 --> 01:19:04.149
Ernie, give me a hand.

01:19:19.960 --> 01:19:21.307
George?

01:19:21.600 --> 01:19:24.380
What are we gonna do about Harry?

01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:27.029
First things first.

01:19:33.160 --> 01:19:35.110
Do you have a cat?
No!

01:19:35.360 --> 01:19:37.359
Good, then it's just a hairball.

01:19:58.400 --> 01:20:01.879
Are you completely deaf?
I said, "Get me out of here now.

01:20:01.880 --> 01:20:04.079
"Tomorrow is too late!"

01:20:04.080 --> 01:20:05.381
Jerome,

01:20:07.720 --> 01:20:09.863
Jerome, I know where he is.

01:20:10.520 --> 01:20:13.039
What the hell do you think I have
been doing for the last 25 years?

01:20:13.040 --> 01:20:15.547
Him!
Yes, Sasquatch!

01:20:16.080 --> 01:20:17.879
Jerome, this time it is different.

01:20:17.880 --> 01:20:19.989
I've got his address.

01:20:20.720 --> 01:20:22.021
Crazy?

01:20:22.280 --> 01:20:24.839
You let me stay here for one more
hour and I'll show you me crazy.

01:20:24.840 --> 01:20:26.869
Time's running out.

01:20:27.760 --> 01:20:29.061
Jerome,

01:20:29.840 --> 01:20:33.030
you make something happen... now.

01:20:34.600 --> 01:20:36.439
Irene, the phone. I've
gotta get the phone. Okay.

01:20:36.440 --> 01:20:38.439
I just need someone to talk to.

01:20:38.440 --> 01:20:41.239
You know, it hasn't been easy
with this pool and everything!

01:20:41.240 --> 01:20:43.239
And Herb? He's no help!

01:20:43.240 --> 01:20:47.750
His latest theory is that a condor
flew over and took a shit in it!

01:20:51.640 --> 01:20:52.941
<i>Hello?</i>

01:20:54.160 --> 01:20:56.224
<i>Hello?</i>
Hello.

01:20:56.520 --> 01:21:01.269
<i>I saw you on television last night,
Mr. Hen, and I think we should talk.</i>

01:21:02.320 --> 01:21:03.959
Who is this?
<i>Do the words,</i>

01:21:03.960 --> 01:21:06.119
<i>"Vital facts that could
prevent a tragic</i>

01:21:06.120 --> 01:21:08.439
<i>"and unnecessary end
for the big fellow, "</i>

01:21:08.440 --> 01:21:10.185
<i>ring a bell?</i>

01:21:11.440 --> 01:21:14.799
Nancy, it's Wrightwood. Dr. Wrightwood?
<i>Yes. How are you?</i>

01:21:14.800 --> 01:21:16.839
Fine.
<i>Can we get together?</i>

01:21:16.840 --> 01:21:19.666
Sure, any time.
Now, this afternoon.

01:21:20.360 --> 01:21:21.900
Well.

01:21:24.640 --> 01:21:26.305
Come to the house.

01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:28.984
How about dinner?

01:21:29.040 --> 01:21:31.919
<i>Hello, are you still there?</i>
Sorry, bad connection.

01:21:31.920 --> 01:21:34.348
You're up near Index, right?

01:21:34.400 --> 01:21:38.421
Just take the I-5 right into town.
We're in the Wallingford section.

01:21:42.160 --> 01:21:44.479
George? What are you doing?

01:21:59.080 --> 01:22:00.461
You?

01:22:01.440 --> 01:22:04.141
I'm Wallace Wrightwood.

01:22:06.320 --> 01:22:08.190
Dr. Wrightwood.

01:22:08.360 --> 01:22:10.150
May I come in?

01:22:10.360 --> 01:22:12.079
Yes, of course you can.

01:22:12.080 --> 01:22:14.959
Nancy, this is Dr. Wrightwood.

01:22:14.960 --> 01:22:18.799
He's the curator of the Bigfoot
Museum I told you about.

01:22:18.800 --> 01:22:22.502
I'm pleased to meet you.
Likewise. Thank you.

01:22:22.600 --> 01:22:24.629
These are beautiful.

01:22:24.680 --> 01:22:27.631
This is our daughter Sarah.
Hello.

01:22:27.680 --> 01:22:30.879
Oh, and this is our son, Ernest.

01:22:30.880 --> 01:22:32.039
- Hello.
- Hello.

01:22:32.040 --> 01:22:34.159
Ernie, this is Dr. Wrightwood.

01:22:34.160 --> 01:22:36.428
Something sure smells...

01:22:39.240 --> 01:22:40.759
good.

01:22:40.760 --> 01:22:43.666
That's dinner.
Roast beef.

01:22:45.280 --> 01:22:47.959
Mom, where's the roast?

01:22:47.960 --> 01:22:51.025
The roast. I'll get it, hon.
The roast,

01:22:51.080 --> 01:22:55.271
is resting in a shallow unmarked
grave in the back yard.

01:22:59.760 --> 01:23:01.119
Oh.

01:23:01.120 --> 01:23:03.821
Right. Well, there's
plenty of other stuff.

01:23:08.560 --> 01:23:10.624
Are you vegetarians?

01:23:12.440 --> 01:23:15.266
Sometimes.
It depends on the guest.

01:23:35.640 --> 01:23:39.679
As you probably know, your Dad paid me
a visit the other day at my museum.

01:23:39.680 --> 01:23:41.359
I liked him.

01:23:41.360 --> 01:23:45.460
What I'm gonna say now
just might save his life.

01:23:47.080 --> 01:23:48.799
I don't understand.

01:23:48.800 --> 01:23:52.439
When I was younger I used to have a
good job working as a lab scientist.

01:23:52.440 --> 01:23:54.310
Life was great.

01:23:54.480 --> 01:23:58.079
And then something happened on a
hunting trip darn-near 50 years ago

01:23:58.080 --> 01:24:00.860
that let the air out of everything.

01:24:01.280 --> 01:24:03.439
I went out for a walk
one day in the woods.

01:24:03.440 --> 01:24:04.999
I heard a rustle behind me.

01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:08.719
Then I smelled something
that made my eyes water

01:24:08.720 --> 01:24:11.307
and my lungs smoke!

01:24:11.440 --> 01:24:15.347
By the time I turned around
all I saw was a streak of fur.

01:24:15.880 --> 01:24:18.751
On the ground
there was a footprint.

01:24:19.360 --> 01:24:22.106
A big footprint.

01:24:23.200 --> 01:24:26.879
So, I was hooked
from that moment on.

01:24:26.880 --> 01:24:29.959
I started spending all the time I
could spare searching for the beast.

01:24:29.960 --> 01:24:32.388
Then I spent time I couldn't spare.

01:24:32.520 --> 01:24:35.585
That's how I lost my job
and my friends.

01:24:36.600 --> 01:24:37.959
It's so sad.

01:24:37.960 --> 01:24:40.799
Well, I didn't tell it so you
could cry in your sprouts,

01:24:40.800 --> 01:24:43.307
or whatever that is, darling.

01:24:43.360 --> 01:24:48.143
I'm telling it so that your father
won't make the same mistake.

01:24:49.680 --> 01:24:51.999
I appreciate what you're
saying, Dr. Wrightwood,

01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:54.279
but there's a big difference
between your story and mine.

01:24:54.280 --> 01:24:56.359
Not as big as you think.

01:24:56.360 --> 01:24:57.559
Maybe even bigger.

01:24:57.560 --> 01:25:00.180
No, no, no. You're kidding yourself.

01:25:04.040 --> 01:25:07.559
I remember what you told me
when you came into my shop.

01:25:07.560 --> 01:25:11.785
Bigfoot can come live with us.
We'll accept the responsibility.

01:25:12.200 --> 01:25:16.824
Can you imagine what a Bigfoot
would do to your home?

01:25:18.080 --> 01:25:19.791
Yeah, well, I can.

01:25:20.080 --> 01:25:21.825
You're good people.

01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:24.719
I'm gonna say this once.

01:25:24.720 --> 01:25:29.582
I'm gonna say it simple and I hope to
God for your sakes you all listen.

01:25:29.840 --> 01:25:32.919
There are no abominable snowmen.

01:25:32.920 --> 01:25:35.199
There are no Sasquatches.

01:25:35.200 --> 01:25:37.343
There are no Bigfeet!

01:25:44.320 --> 01:25:46.543
Am I missing something?

01:25:59.440 --> 01:26:02.999
Oh, Lord! Lord God!

01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:05.985
Dr. Wrightwood, say hello to Harry.

01:26:10.760 --> 01:26:12.346
Harry?

01:26:29.480 --> 01:26:31.319
Isn't he something?

01:26:31.320 --> 01:26:36.439
Oh, yes, he's so smart, too. I mean,
George has taught him how to sit.

01:26:36.440 --> 01:26:37.946
To sit?

01:26:48.440 --> 01:26:51.550
We haven't quite perfected it yet.

01:26:52.600 --> 01:26:54.106
Hungry?

01:27:02.080 --> 01:27:04.199
He lives here with you?

01:27:04.200 --> 01:27:05.945
Temporarily.

01:27:31.080 --> 01:27:32.541
Well?

01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:37.399
If I call in a favor, I might be able
to get you out sometime tonight.

01:27:37.400 --> 01:27:39.919
Sometime tonight?
I need a damn good reason.

01:27:39.920 --> 01:27:44.111
For Christ's sake, I'm talking
about bagging a Sasquatch!

01:27:44.840 --> 01:27:47.461
That'll cut a lot of ice
for the judge.

01:27:47.920 --> 01:27:50.599
It's just not
Harry's world out there.

01:27:50.600 --> 01:27:54.427
It's like we've become an
enemy to anything wondrous.

01:27:54.480 --> 01:27:57.879
Even the scientific community's
gonna poke and prod at him

01:27:57.880 --> 01:28:01.901
until he hates every man that
he sees, including you and me.

01:28:02.040 --> 01:28:05.839
The only answer is a safe place
where even LaFleur can't find him.

01:28:05.840 --> 01:28:09.599
I might know a place, but we'd never
be able to find it in the dark.

01:28:09.600 --> 01:28:11.119
Then you will help us?

01:28:11.120 --> 01:28:13.548
In every way I possibly can.

01:28:13.840 --> 01:28:15.599
That's wonderful.

01:28:15.600 --> 01:28:17.279
We'll leave first thing
in the morning.

01:28:17.280 --> 01:28:19.919
I'll wake the kids. Real early.
They'll wanna come.

01:28:19.920 --> 01:28:22.143
We'll make a whole day of it.

01:28:22.200 --> 01:28:24.343
Our last day with Harry.

01:28:29.160 --> 01:28:30.985
He's so odd.

01:28:31.040 --> 01:28:32.879
He didn't say good night.

01:28:32.880 --> 01:28:35.945
I don't even know
when he's coming back.

01:28:54.360 --> 01:28:56.424
Now, get some sleep.

01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:32.279
And where the hell have you been?
There was nothing I could do!

01:29:32.280 --> 01:29:33.319
Don't bullshit!

01:29:33.320 --> 01:29:35.639
They weren't letting anybody out
until they processed those guns

01:29:35.640 --> 01:29:37.749
and there were a lot of guns!

01:29:38.560 --> 01:29:40.799
You need a bath.
And what? Blow my cover?

01:29:40.800 --> 01:29:42.959
Hey, come on!
Come on, give me my things!

01:29:42.960 --> 01:29:44.959
Hey, when I'm ready, pal.

01:29:44.960 --> 01:29:47.639
When he's ready, pal.
Jerome, do something, eh?

01:29:47.640 --> 01:29:49.430
So what's your sign?

01:29:51.640 --> 01:29:53.385
Kimchee!

01:29:53.640 --> 01:29:56.625
Kimchee! Kimchee!

01:29:57.960 --> 01:30:01.399
My name is Kim Lee not Kimchee!

01:30:01.400 --> 01:30:03.304
You killed them!

01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:05.586
Oh, no!

01:30:06.160 --> 01:30:09.066
Where are my
precious little babies?

01:30:26.320 --> 01:30:27.951
Thank you.

01:30:30.400 --> 01:30:33.749
Forgive me, Harry?

01:30:50.440 --> 01:30:53.823
I'm gonna show these to Irene.
She loves roses.

01:31:06.680 --> 01:31:10.039
Sure would be a dream come
true if we could keep him.

01:31:10.040 --> 01:31:13.105
Well, you know what they say,

01:31:13.120 --> 01:31:16.264
"The best things in life
are supposed to be free."

01:31:16.320 --> 01:31:18.519
Hold it right there, mister.

01:31:18.520 --> 01:31:20.948
What did you do to my roses?

01:31:22.240 --> 01:31:25.191
No!
Don't even think about it!

01:31:25.480 --> 01:31:27.279
One false move out of you

01:31:27.280 --> 01:31:29.119
and I'm gonna prune your plant.

01:31:29.120 --> 01:31:31.866
And I'm talking nip it in the bud!

01:31:34.640 --> 01:31:36.180
My God!

01:31:47.600 --> 01:31:50.187
Push.
Hurry up, Dad.

01:31:57.440 --> 01:31:59.230
George, you drive.

01:32:08.480 --> 01:32:11.226
It's not fair!
He should be mine!

01:32:14.920 --> 01:32:16.506
Damn you!

01:32:44.760 --> 01:32:46.639
LaFleur!
What?

01:32:46.640 --> 01:32:49.944
I think we're being followed
by our own car!

01:32:49.960 --> 01:32:51.625
Wow!

01:32:52.800 --> 01:32:54.704
He stole my car!

01:33:00.120 --> 01:33:03.071
Oh, my God, will
you look at this traffic?

01:33:19.000 --> 01:33:20.301
Damn!

01:33:26.880 --> 01:33:28.511
Cops!

01:33:28.800 --> 01:33:31.421
Everybody just act normal.

01:33:38.360 --> 01:33:40.230
Here he comes!

01:33:43.240 --> 01:33:46.191
Look what he's doing
to my paint job!

01:33:46.840 --> 01:33:48.790
He's almost on us, Dad!

01:34:10.240 --> 01:34:11.919
George, could you go
a little faster?

01:34:11.920 --> 01:34:14.719
All right, Mom!
That sucker's history!

01:34:14.720 --> 01:34:18.581
Don't kid yourself. This
is the part he's good at.

01:34:19.040 --> 01:34:20.705
Yay!

01:34:44.760 --> 01:34:46.744
I always miss it.

01:35:12.120 --> 01:35:14.502
Hurry.
Up here, George.

01:35:21.360 --> 01:35:22.741
Hurry!

01:35:37.000 --> 01:35:39.871
You better make this
a short goodbye, George.

01:35:43.120 --> 01:35:46.310
You've gotta go back
where you belong now.

01:35:47.480 --> 01:35:49.350
Come on, now.

01:35:50.320 --> 01:35:52.190
It's LaFleur!

01:35:53.480 --> 01:35:55.669
Harry, you've gotta go!

01:35:56.360 --> 01:35:57.946
LaFleur!

01:35:58.800 --> 01:36:01.831
Hurry, please, please!
There's no time!

01:36:02.000 --> 01:36:04.302
No, don't worry about us!

01:36:04.600 --> 01:36:06.664
We'll be all right.

01:36:19.600 --> 01:36:21.479
Get out of here!

01:36:21.480 --> 01:36:24.590
Can't you see
we don't want you anymore?

01:36:24.680 --> 01:36:27.790
Why can't you go back
where you came from?

01:36:31.200 --> 01:36:33.264
Now, leave us alone!

01:36:44.200 --> 01:36:45.501
Go.

01:36:47.880 --> 01:36:49.181
Go!

01:37:07.880 --> 01:37:09.864
Goodbye, my friend.

01:37:11.960 --> 01:37:14.183
There's no need to cry.

01:37:15.920 --> 01:37:18.700
We'll never see him again, will we?

01:37:19.120 --> 01:37:22.742
Sure we will! We can just
follow his footprints.

01:37:24.400 --> 01:37:26.065
Footprints.

01:38:02.480 --> 01:38:05.784
Scatter.
Anything to throw him off!

01:39:01.160 --> 01:39:03.189
It's a goddamn herd!

01:39:25.360 --> 01:39:26.661
Oh, no!

01:41:31.720 --> 01:41:33.181
Harry!

01:41:36.560 --> 01:41:39.511
Good God! Harry, no!

01:41:44.560 --> 01:41:48.359
Listen to me. You're wrong!
I was like you!

01:41:48.360 --> 01:41:50.319
I almost killed him myself!

01:41:50.320 --> 01:41:52.759
But it would have been murder!
He's not an animal!

01:41:52.760 --> 01:41:54.199
He's our friend!

01:41:54.200 --> 01:41:56.039
For God's sake, Jacques,
open your eyes!

01:41:56.040 --> 01:41:57.879
Are you people out of your minds?

01:41:57.880 --> 01:42:00.359
Do you think I'm going to stop now?

01:42:00.360 --> 01:42:03.039
I'm going to kill him.
You're not gonna kill him!

01:42:03.040 --> 01:42:05.213
You're not gonna hurt him!
I won't let you!

01:42:05.214 --> 01:42:05.799
George!

01:42:05.800 --> 01:42:07.829
George!
I'll kill you first!

01:42:25.920 --> 01:42:28.109
Don't let him kill me!

01:42:28.680 --> 01:42:32.382
Don't let him kill me!
Please, don't let him kill me!

01:42:33.200 --> 01:42:37.744
Don't let him kill me! Please,
don't, don't let him kill me.

01:43:08.840 --> 01:43:10.221
I'm...

01:43:11.360 --> 01:43:12.786
No, no...

01:43:14.760 --> 01:43:17.825
Jacques LaFleur, meet Harry.

01:43:18.960 --> 01:43:20.830
Harry Henderson.

01:43:42.240 --> 01:43:44.508
Strange feeling, eh, Doc?

01:43:44.800 --> 01:43:47.228
What are you talking about?

01:43:48.000 --> 01:43:50.519
It's over.
Over?

01:43:50.520 --> 01:43:52.788
Why, it's just the beginning.

01:43:53.320 --> 01:43:56.719
Jocko, this old ticker hasn't
thumped like this for years.

01:43:56.720 --> 01:43:59.599
It's like going to heaven with
your feet still on the ground.

01:43:59.600 --> 01:44:03.347
And we get to share it with
one of our oldest friends.

01:44:25.640 --> 01:44:27.465
Goodbye, Harry.

01:44:28.880 --> 01:44:30.989
We gotta let him go.

01:44:40.240 --> 01:44:41.826
Harry...

01:44:54.360 --> 01:44:57.106
I never got a chance to thank you.

01:44:59.560 --> 01:45:03.546
I don't think you'll ever know
how much you've meant to us.

01:45:18.240 --> 01:45:20.861
You take care of
yourself now, okay?

01:45:22.920 --> 01:45:24.346
Okay.

01:45:29.920 --> 01:45:33.383
<i>Mon dieu!</i>
They have a language?

01:46:23.480 --> 01:46:27.227
Now, Jocko, what for you?
I don't know.

01:46:29.360 --> 01:46:31.788
There's always Loch Ness.
