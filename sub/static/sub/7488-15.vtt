WEBVTT

00:05.205 --> 00:08.085
Can you play this?

00:12.812 --> 00:17.312
Oh, please. I can play
that in my sleep.

00:25.005 --> 00:28.425
Can you play it this way?

00:30.000 --> 00:36.074

00:41.779 --> 00:44.299
"Yes, I can."

00:45.364 --> 00:49.348
Guess who got a job
in Dez's movie!

00:49.349 --> 00:51.584
That's right, I'm shooting
my first big movie.

00:51.585 --> 00:54.420
It's about a giant sand
crab who attacks Miami.

00:54.421 --> 00:58.261
I call it "Claws, Dun Dun Dun!"

00:58.526 --> 01:01.016
Ooh, "Claws." I like that title.

01:01.017 --> 01:05.498
It's not called "Claws". It's
called "Claws, Dun Dun Dun."

01:05.500 --> 01:08.661
Yeah yeah, who cares about the
title or the stupid crab?

01:08.662 --> 01:10.918
My character's the real star.

01:10.919 --> 01:13.079
Girl ♪2.

01:13.130 --> 01:15.375
Girl ♪2 gets eaten
in the first scene.

01:15.376 --> 01:18.168
What?! You didn't tell me that.

01:18.169 --> 01:20.636
If girl ♪2 doesn't live
till the end of the movie,

01:20.637 --> 01:24.109
neither will the director.
Dun dun dun!

01:24.110 --> 01:26.890
Fine, your character won't
get eaten till the end.

01:26.891 --> 01:29.711
But just so you know, I'm
naming the crab Trish...

01:29.712 --> 01:32.596
Because it's mean and
everyone's afraid of it.

01:32.597 --> 01:36.017
Oh, Dez. That's so sweet.

01:36.600 --> 01:38.468
You're gonna be
in the movie too.

01:38.469 --> 01:40.672
You're going to play Troy,
the handsome lifeguard

01:40.673 --> 01:42.890
who battles the crab
and saves the town.

01:42.891 --> 01:46.118
Awesome! Now I'm officially
a quadruple threat...

01:46.119 --> 01:50.319
Actor, singer, dancer,
and balloon-er.

01:57.548 --> 02:02.018
And Ally, that leaves
just one role left...

02:02.019 --> 02:04.431
The cute songwriter who works
at the local music store.

02:04.432 --> 02:09.402
Sally. I wrote it specifically for
the most talented girl I know.

02:09.404 --> 02:11.242
Dez, I'm flattered.

02:11.243 --> 02:14.363
Not you, Selena Gomez.

02:14.414 --> 02:16.656
But she's unavailable, so...

02:16.657 --> 02:18.996
Do you wanna play the part?

02:18.997 --> 02:21.932
As much as I appreciate
being your second choice,

02:21.933 --> 02:24.519
I can't do your movie.
I have stage fright.

02:24.520 --> 02:27.047
But you have to. We start
shooting tomorrow.

02:27.048 --> 02:28.803
I'll play Sally.

02:28.804 --> 02:30.950
How you going to play two
parts in the same movie?

02:30.951 --> 02:34.937
It's easy. When I was in middle school,
I played three parts in the same play.

02:34.938 --> 02:36.973
It was a modern take
on "Romeo and Juliet,"

02:40.573 --> 02:43.399
"Romeo and Juliet and Lupita."

02:43.400 --> 02:47.532
"Oh, Romeo, Romeo,
wherefore art thou Romeo?"

02:47.533 --> 02:51.459
"It is the east and
Juliet is the sun."

02:51.460 --> 02:55.420
"No te quiero cerca
de mi novio."

03:02.796 --> 03:05.898
<i>When the crowd wants more,
I bring on the thunder.</i>

03:05.899 --> 03:09.033
<i>'Cause you've got my back,
and I'm not going under.</i>

03:09.034 --> 03:10.565
<i>You're my point,
you're my guard.</i>

03:10.566 --> 03:12.184
<i>You're the perfect chord.</i>

03:12.185 --> 03:15.229
<i>And I see our names together
on every billboard.</i>

03:15.230 --> 03:18.288
<i>We're headed for the top,
we've got it on lock.</i>

03:18.289 --> 03:19.902
<i>We'll make 'em say "hey!"</i>

03:19.903 --> 03:22.225
<i>And we'll keep rockin'.</i>

03:22.226 --> 03:26.363
<i>Oh, there's no way I could
make it without ya.</i>

03:26.364 --> 03:29.399
<i>Do it without ya,
be here without ya.</i>

03:29.400 --> 03:32.469
<i>It's no fun when
you're doing it solo.</i>

03:32.470 --> 03:35.792
<i>With you it's like, "whoa".
Yeah, and I know.</i>

03:35.793 --> 03:38.442
<i>I own this dream.</i>

03:38.443 --> 03:41.820
<i>'Cause I got you with me.</i>

03:41.821 --> 03:44.938
<i>There's no way I could
make it without ya.</i>

03:44.939 --> 03:49.199
<i>Do it without ya,
be here without ya.</i>

03:56.014 --> 03:58.339
I still don't get why you
can't be in Dez's movie.

03:58.340 --> 04:01.716
I know you have stage fright, but
it's not like there's an audience,

04:01.717 --> 04:03.768
just Dez and some actors.

04:03.769 --> 04:06.549
It doesn't matter. I still have
to perform in front of people.

04:06.550 --> 04:08.382
I don't like that
kind of pressure.

04:08.383 --> 04:10.937
But you have the most
gruesome death in the movie.

04:10.938 --> 04:15.590
The crab rips you in half and then your
head gets to watch him eat your legs.

04:15.591 --> 04:17.954
No way! That changes everything.

04:17.954 --> 04:20.535
- Really?
- No.

04:22.631 --> 04:23.998
So how are the auditions going?

04:23.999 --> 04:26.734
Great. There's only one
more role to cast.

04:26.735 --> 04:30.195
I'm here to audition
for "Santa Claus."

04:30.196 --> 04:34.497
Nelson, the movie's called
"Claws," not "Santa Claus."

04:34.498 --> 04:36.778
Aw, nartz!

04:36.812 --> 04:41.912
You know how hard it was
to build this in Miami?

04:43.893 --> 04:47.559
Dez, I hope you don't mind, I made
some small changes to your script,

04:47.560 --> 04:49.157
starting with the title.

04:49.158 --> 04:51.501
"Girl ♪2 versus Claws."

04:51.502 --> 04:53.102
And if you don't like that,
we could just go with...

04:53.103 --> 04:55.361
"Girl ♪2: The movie."

04:55.362 --> 04:56.963
No! No no no no no!

04:56.964 --> 05:00.044
We're making the movie like I wrote it.
This is my dream.

05:00.045 --> 05:03.872
I still want to help you on
your movie, just not on camera.

05:03.873 --> 05:05.874
Hey Dez, let her do props.

05:05.875 --> 05:08.655
Didn't you say you needed someone to
build you a miniature lighthouse?

05:08.656 --> 05:10.791
Yeah, but that's going
to take hours and hours.

05:10.792 --> 05:13.594
I need someone with,
like, no social life.

05:13.595 --> 05:15.105
That's perfect for Ally!

05:15.106 --> 05:17.187
Hey, I have a social life.

05:17.188 --> 05:21.092
I'll have you know, I went
to a party last year.

05:21.093 --> 05:23.445
It was back-to-school night.

05:23.446 --> 05:27.417
There were refreshments and teachers.
That makes it a party.

05:27.418 --> 05:31.703
- No, it doesn't.
- Okay, I'm your prop girl.

05:31.704 --> 05:33.671
So what are you going to
do about Ally's part?

05:33.672 --> 05:34.832
I rewrote it.

05:34.833 --> 05:38.030
Now you just pull the girl out of the
ocean and give her mouth-to-mouth.

05:38.031 --> 05:40.037
It's between those
two actresses.

05:40.038 --> 05:43.715
I'm leaning towards Brittany, but
Mildred's got some good acting chops.

05:43.716 --> 05:46.071
- Pick Brittany! Pick Brittany!
- Okay.

05:46.072 --> 05:50.393
The part's yours, Brittany.
You can go, Mildred.

05:50.394 --> 05:52.724
That's Brittany? Pick Mildred!
Pick Mildred!

05:52.725 --> 05:55.361
Oh, scratch that.
You're out, Brittany.

05:55.362 --> 05:58.662
Mildred, you're back in.

06:11.792 --> 06:16.352
Here's your lighthouse, Dez. I
was up all night making it.

06:16.353 --> 06:18.824
- This is amazing.
- Thank you.

06:18.825 --> 06:23.215
It took 7,000 toothpicks, 83 bottles of
glue, and one trip the emergency room

06:23.216 --> 06:26.732
to get a glued toothpick out
of my nose, but it's done!

06:26.733 --> 06:29.662
Wow. It lights up, it spins
around and everything.

06:29.663 --> 06:31.870
I almost feel bad for cutting
it out of the movie.

06:31.871 --> 06:34.500
Ha! Don't feel bad. I kind of...
What?!

06:34.501 --> 06:35.767
You're cutting my prop?

06:35.768 --> 06:38.122
Ooh, yeah, we're not going
to shoot that scene,

06:38.123 --> 06:40.314
so we don't need that
lighthouse any more.

06:40.315 --> 06:42.495
Man, isn't showbiz fun?

06:42.496 --> 06:45.174
Okay, guys, we're shooting
the finale first.

06:45.175 --> 06:48.330
Troy the lifeguard rescues the
drowning girl from the ocean.

06:48.331 --> 06:49.456
I'll save her!

06:49.457 --> 06:52.349
Whoa, Nelson, you're not
playing Troy the lifeguard.

06:52.350 --> 06:57.904
- You're playing scared little boy.
- No fair! I'm calling my agent!

06:57.905 --> 07:00.065
Hi, mom.

07:00.722 --> 07:03.761
Okay. Austin, after
you rescue the girl,

07:03.762 --> 07:08.230
Claws is going to suddenly
come up through the sand.

07:08.231 --> 07:10.217
Whoa, that thing looks scary!

07:10.218 --> 07:14.245
Yeah, but it's all special effects.
That claw is perfectly safe.

07:14.246 --> 07:16.608
Help help! This
stupid claw's got me!

07:16.609 --> 07:18.409
Oh!

07:20.959 --> 07:22.714
That was pretty good, right?

07:22.715 --> 07:25.783
Quit messing around, Trish.
You don't get eaten by Claws.

07:25.784 --> 07:28.066
You just scream when it
comes out of the sand.

07:28.067 --> 07:29.586
All I do is scream?

07:29.587 --> 07:33.072
Oh, what if I say, "Claws, no!"

07:33.073 --> 07:36.036
"Don't eat my sister?"

07:36.037 --> 07:37.540
She's not your sister.

07:37.541 --> 07:40.563
I know. I thought it'd be more
dramatic if we were related.

07:40.564 --> 07:44.209
And then when the claw attacked
her, I could cry in a close-up.

07:44.210 --> 07:46.850
"Why? Oh, why?"

07:47.214 --> 07:51.474
"Why did you have
to take my sister?"

07:53.211 --> 07:54.923
I could amp it up
more if you want.

07:54.924 --> 07:56.735
Hey, I am the director.

07:56.736 --> 08:02.049
Nobody comes onto my movie set and
changes my script except for me.

08:02.050 --> 08:07.092
Could you change the line to, "why?
Why? Why did you take my sister?"

08:07.093 --> 08:09.194
Maybe the line would work better

08:09.195 --> 08:12.985
if Trish was looking at a
lighthouse in the distance.

08:12.986 --> 08:16.346
Ooh, sorry, no lighthouse.

08:16.868 --> 08:19.380
Okay, let's shoot this thing!

08:19.381 --> 08:22.448
Austin, when you save the girl, you're
gonna lay her down in the sand,

08:22.449 --> 08:24.554
under the umbrella.

08:24.555 --> 08:28.080
- Under the...
- Under the umbrella.

08:28.081 --> 08:30.421
And action!

08:30.552 --> 08:32.038
I'll save you!

08:32.039 --> 08:34.558
Ah, help! Ah!

08:36.761 --> 08:39.490
You're okay... I'm gonna
put you on the sand.

08:39.491 --> 08:44.111
Nothing bad can happen
to you on the sand.

08:44.792 --> 08:47.233
Are you sure it has to
be under the umbrella?

08:47.234 --> 08:49.168
Cut! Uh, yeah.

08:49.169 --> 08:51.103
It has to be under the umbrella.

08:51.104 --> 08:54.624
I can't do your movie.
Sorry, Dez.

08:54.625 --> 08:57.205
Sorry, Mildred.

08:57.979 --> 09:00.351
Did he just say he
can't do my movie?

09:00.352 --> 09:05.623
- What was that about?
- Maybe he caught stage fright from Ally!

09:05.624 --> 09:08.506
Stage fright's not contagious.

09:08.507 --> 09:11.027
Just in case.

09:25.104 --> 09:28.040
Hey, why did you
run off like that?

09:28.041 --> 09:32.246
It almost seemed like you were afraid
to go under the beach umbrella.

09:32.247 --> 09:33.598
That's ridiculous.

09:33.599 --> 09:35.739
I mean, who's afraid
of umbrellas?

09:35.740 --> 09:38.803
I know, that would weird, right?

09:38.804 --> 09:41.274
It's not weird!

09:41.275 --> 09:44.415
No way. You're
afraid of umbrellas.

09:44.416 --> 09:47.577
Pf ft! I know you
are, but what am I?

09:47.578 --> 09:50.744
You're afraid of umbrellas.

09:50.745 --> 09:52.253
Ah!

09:52.254 --> 09:55.217
Okay, fine, I'm
afraid of umbrellas.

09:55.218 --> 09:58.563
Go ahead, laugh. I know
you think it's silly.

09:58.564 --> 10:00.484
What?

10:00.821 --> 10:02.751
I don't think it's silly.

10:02.752 --> 10:04.827
I'm afraid of umbrellas too!

10:04.828 --> 10:07.328
Every time I see an
umbrella, I'm like..

10:07.329 --> 10:10.929
"Ah! Umbrellas are so scary!"

10:11.875 --> 10:13.400
Nice try.

10:13.401 --> 10:16.881
You don't know how tough it is.
Umbrellas are everywhere...

10:16.882 --> 10:18.929
Patio umbrellas, rain umbrellas,

10:18.930 --> 10:21.077
tiny umbrellas they
put in fruit drinks.

10:21.078 --> 10:24.318
Oh, you mean like this?

10:24.648 --> 10:27.648
Oh, um, sorry. Um...

10:28.140 --> 10:31.737
Why are you afraid
of them anyway?

10:31.738 --> 10:33.918
- Can you keep a secret?
- Who am I going to tell?

10:33.919 --> 10:37.399
I go to one party a year.

10:38.894 --> 10:40.085
Fine.

10:40.086 --> 10:43.626
It happened in fourth grade.

10:43.732 --> 10:47.768
We were on a field trip to the beach and
brought umbrellas in case it rained.

10:47.769 --> 10:51.234
Some day I'm going to make a
movie about a giant sand crab.

10:51.235 --> 10:53.007
Dun dun dun!

10:53.008 --> 10:56.711
Some day I'm going to be an
overnight Internet sensation.

10:56.712 --> 10:58.432
Hey, Dez, check it out.

10:58.433 --> 11:01.299
I'm gonna jump off that sand
dune and see if I can fly.

11:01.300 --> 11:03.135
How you gonna do that, Austin?

11:03.136 --> 11:05.896
With my umbrella.

11:06.391 --> 11:08.925
I'm gonna go get my camera
off the bus to film this.

11:08.926 --> 11:12.051
The umbrella got stuck in my
belt loop, a gust of wind came

11:12.052 --> 11:15.768
and the umbrella flew
away with my pants.

11:15.769 --> 11:18.069
All the kids were
laughing at me.

11:18.070 --> 11:20.830
I was humiliated.

11:24.318 --> 11:27.558
Hey, look, flying pants!

11:28.880 --> 11:31.343
Well, now I know why you're
scared of umbrellas.

11:31.344 --> 11:34.031
I've never been more
embarrassed in my life.

11:34.032 --> 11:36.558
That's why I've never told
anyone that story before.

11:36.559 --> 11:39.737
Not even Dez knows that
I'm afraid of umbrellas.

11:39.738 --> 11:41.756
Well, your secret's
safe with me.

11:41.757 --> 11:43.288
What secret?

11:43.289 --> 11:45.869
- Um...
- Um...

11:47.519 --> 11:49.979
I'm waiting.

11:50.098 --> 11:53.315
Um, Austin's caught
my stage fright.

11:53.316 --> 11:55.226
I knew it was contagious!

11:55.227 --> 11:57.397
Austin, you've got to
come back to my movie.

11:57.398 --> 11:59.055
Come on, Austin, I need you!

11:59.056 --> 12:01.626
This movie can get me to
my first film festival.

12:01.627 --> 12:05.047
You know that's my dream.

12:05.845 --> 12:07.443
I know.

12:07.444 --> 12:09.591
Count me back in. I won't
let you down, buddy.

12:09.592 --> 12:11.275
Great. See you
guys at the beach.

12:11.276 --> 12:13.277
Oh, and before I forget,

12:13.278 --> 12:16.546
Ally, I need you to make one of
these claw crackers for the movie.

12:16.547 --> 12:18.989
- That shouldn't be too hard.
- It's gotta be five feet tall.

12:18.990 --> 12:23.550
And I need it in one hour.
See you guys!

12:30.105 --> 12:33.030
What am I going to do, Ally?
Dez is counting on me.

12:33.031 --> 12:34.691
I've got a plan.

12:34.692 --> 12:37.770
You're afraid of umbrellas because
you connect them with a bad memory.

12:37.771 --> 12:42.027
To overcome that fear, you have to
connect umbrellas with a good memory.

12:42.028 --> 12:44.510
From now on, whenever
you think of umbrellas,

12:44.511 --> 12:46.612
you're gonna think of your
three favorite things.

12:46.613 --> 12:48.680
Pancakes, cheerleaders
and Lebron James?

12:48.681 --> 12:50.781
Exactly.

12:51.784 --> 12:54.067
You got Lebron James?

12:54.068 --> 12:57.848
No, but I got his limo driver.

12:58.490 --> 13:04.390
All you have to do is sit under the
patio umbrella and make a good memory.

13:05.731 --> 13:08.371
I can do that.

13:08.484 --> 13:11.544
- Yeah, I can.
- Boo.

13:12.736 --> 13:15.676
You're doing great.

13:18.018 --> 13:20.898
There you go. See?

13:31.424 --> 13:34.964
I think this is gonna work.

13:36.763 --> 13:41.083
Uh-oh, looks like
it's going to rain.

13:43.636 --> 13:47.896
This is supposed to
be a good memory!

13:49.269 --> 13:52.029
It's chasing me!

13:58.374 --> 14:01.422
Um, Ally, I think I'm still
afraid of umbrellas.

14:01.423 --> 14:06.883
Well, at least you still have
your pants on this time.

14:19.436 --> 14:22.834
I can either scream like this...

14:22.835 --> 14:25.475
Or like this...

14:26.530 --> 14:28.264
They both sound the same.

14:28.265 --> 14:32.525
- The second one was in spanish.
- Oh!

14:33.154 --> 14:35.337
You guys ready to
shoot this scene?

14:35.338 --> 14:37.673
I don't know, Dez. It looks
like it's gonna rain.

14:37.674 --> 14:39.475
No problem.

14:39.476 --> 14:41.772
We have these.

14:41.773 --> 14:43.416
Oh yay.

14:43.417 --> 14:45.647
I didn't sign up for
shooting in the rain.

14:45.648 --> 14:47.649
I'm just gonna use
my stunt double.

14:47.650 --> 14:50.950
You have a stunt double?

14:52.422 --> 14:55.173
There's a scene where Claws
tosses me off a 30-foot cliff.

14:55.174 --> 14:57.726
Better her than me.

14:57.727 --> 15:02.397
So, Brittany, how do you
feel about cliff diving?

15:02.398 --> 15:07.669
Hey, Dez, what if we shoot the
movie without any umbrellas?

15:07.670 --> 15:10.261
We can't. It's symbolic.

15:10.262 --> 15:11.956
Umbrellas protect
people from rain

15:11.957 --> 15:16.243
and your character protects Miami
from Claws' reign of terror.

15:16.244 --> 15:19.244
You are an umbrella.

15:21.137 --> 15:25.337
See you guys down at the beach!
Woo!

15:25.453 --> 15:27.620
I don't know what to do, Ally.

15:27.621 --> 15:30.529
I should just tell Dez
I can't do his movie.

15:30.530 --> 15:32.535
I'm never gonna
get over my fear.

15:32.536 --> 15:34.413
Yes, you are.

15:34.414 --> 15:37.361
I think I'm ready to tell you
how I got my stage fright.

15:37.362 --> 15:39.070
- Really?
- Yeah.

15:39.071 --> 15:42.157
I don't want you to keep going
through what I go through.

15:42.158 --> 15:45.009
It happened a couple
of years ago.

15:45.010 --> 15:48.475
I was auditioning to get into a
prestigious music school in New York.

15:48.476 --> 15:50.421
They sent a scout down
to Florida and my dad

15:50.422 --> 15:52.747
let them use Sonic Boom
to hold auditions.

15:52.748 --> 15:56.108
Well, that was horrendous!

15:56.939 --> 15:59.588
May I suggest a career
smashing watches?

15:59.589 --> 16:04.149
Because you're good at wasting time.
Next!

16:04.395 --> 16:08.462
Well, I hope you're better than
the last girl, Miss Dawson.

16:08.463 --> 16:12.884
You know, getting in this school could
make or break your entire music career.

16:12.885 --> 16:15.210
Don't blow it!

16:15.211 --> 16:17.791
You may begin.

16:18.509 --> 16:23.909
I was so afraid of ruining
my one chance, I lost it.

16:52.643 --> 16:54.701
So, uh...

16:54.702 --> 16:56.922
Do-overs?

17:00.931 --> 17:03.479
Anyway, I didn't get in.

17:03.480 --> 17:05.178
That's why I have stage fright.

17:05.179 --> 17:08.307
You only get so many chances to make
it and I don't want to fail again.

17:08.308 --> 17:12.387
If I don't perform,
I can't fail.

17:13.593 --> 17:17.262
Wow, Ally, I'm just afraid
to be embarrassed again.

17:17.263 --> 17:19.385
Your fear is way
worse than mine.

17:19.386 --> 17:22.708
That's kind of why I
told you the story.

17:22.709 --> 17:24.349
Like ten times worse!

17:24.351 --> 17:28.055
I mean, my umbrella fear doesn't
stop me from chasing my dreams.

17:28.056 --> 17:32.676
But your stage fright?
Wow, you're a mess.

17:32.768 --> 17:35.468
Okay, I get it.

17:35.613 --> 17:39.143
Thanks for making me realize
how silly my fear is.

17:39.144 --> 17:41.077
I'm gonna do Dez's movie.

17:41.078 --> 17:43.617
It's only one little umbrella.

17:43.618 --> 17:46.798
I can totally do this.

17:47.418 --> 17:49.487
That's not one little umbrella.

17:49.488 --> 17:52.422
- I cannot totally do this.
- You're gonna be fine.

17:52.423 --> 17:54.921
Okay, let's shoot this thing.

17:54.922 --> 17:57.837
Ooh, by the way, we're not going
to need the claw cracker.

17:57.838 --> 17:59.591
Ooh!

17:59.592 --> 18:01.344
Of course we're not.

18:01.345 --> 18:03.791
Maybe you can use it to
crack something else.

18:03.792 --> 18:07.452
Oh, I have something in mind.

18:08.663 --> 18:13.041
Okay, Austin, Mildred is under that
umbrella unaware Claws is behind her.

18:13.042 --> 18:14.656
You have to run through
this maze of umbrellas

18:14.657 --> 18:18.039
and battle Claws to the
death with this oar.

18:18.040 --> 18:20.824
- This or what?
- This oar.

18:20.825 --> 18:23.107
- This or what?
- This oar.

18:23.108 --> 18:24.303
This or what?

18:24.304 --> 18:25.985
- This oar!
- Or what?

18:25.986 --> 18:28.746
- This oar!
- This or what?!

18:28.747 --> 18:31.275
Just fight him with the paddle.

18:31.276 --> 18:33.736
<i>Okay. Places!</i>

18:35.233 --> 18:37.609
- And action!
- Ah!

18:37.610 --> 18:41.570
It's Claws! Don't eat my sister!

18:41.697 --> 18:43.557
Why?

18:44.601 --> 18:47.481
Run for your life!

18:59.293 --> 19:02.593
Get off my beach, Claws.

19:04.667 --> 19:08.387
I'm not scared of you, Claws.

19:12.027 --> 19:15.567
I'm not scared of anything.

19:36.698 --> 19:41.138
Looks like we're having
crab for dinner.

19:49.942 --> 19:51.465
This is so awesome.

19:51.466 --> 19:54.031
- Yeah, Dez.
- Thanks, guys.

19:54.032 --> 19:57.504
I got accepted into the
Miami film festival.

19:57.505 --> 19:59.539
I just got my first
acting agent.

19:59.540 --> 20:01.940
- Who?
- Me.

20:03.863 --> 20:07.192
My favorite part was when you decided
to battle the crab with that umbrella.

20:07.193 --> 20:11.236
I can't believe you did that, especially
since you're so scared of umbrellas.

20:11.237 --> 20:12.687
You knew about that?

20:12.688 --> 20:15.522
Uh, yeah-huh! I'm
your best friend.

20:15.523 --> 20:16.945
I know all your secrets,

20:16.946 --> 20:19.853
like your middle name's Monica and you
only wear boxers with trucks on them.

20:19.854 --> 20:20.882
Dez!

20:20.883 --> 20:22.660
If you knew Austin was
afraid of umbrellas,

20:22.661 --> 20:24.734
then why did you put them
all over your movie set?

20:24.735 --> 20:28.626
Because an awesome director knows how
to get real emotion out of people.

20:28.627 --> 20:30.263
I made Austin scared,
Trish annoyed...

20:30.264 --> 20:32.274
- And you angry.
- I'm not angry.

20:32.275 --> 20:33.905
I didn't put any of your
props in that movie.

20:33.906 --> 20:35.796
I know! How could you do that?

20:35.797 --> 20:38.731
See? Awesome director.

20:38.732 --> 20:44.312
You annoyed me on purpose? You
shouldn't have done that.

20:45.879 --> 20:50.319
"Claws, Dun Dun Dun,"
scene 56, take 17.

20:50.392 --> 20:52.994
How about I do the
scene as Gloria?

20:52.995 --> 20:57.435
Crab, you best step
away from my sister.

20:59.141 --> 21:02.083
Cut! Ally, no lighthouse.

21:02.084 --> 21:04.249
It's Santa Claus!

21:04.250 --> 21:08.289
- Run for your lives!
- Cut! It's just "Claws," Nelson.

21:08.290 --> 21:10.090
Ah!

21:11.678 --> 21:13.680
That was perfect, Brittany.

21:13.681 --> 21:16.780
You just have to jump off
that cliff five more times.

21:16.781 --> 21:18.641
Woo!

21:19.686 --> 21:21.123
You're okay!

21:21.124 --> 21:25.666
I'm gonna put you in the sand nothing
bad can happen to you in the sand.

21:25.667 --> 21:29.507
Cut! Ally, I said no lighthouse.

21:30.102 --> 21:33.667
I'm getting too old
for this crab.

21:33.668 --> 21:37.328
Go ahead, Claws, make my day.

21:38.424 --> 21:41.664
Hasta la vista, crabbie.

21:43.772 --> 21:47.012
Crab, I am your father.

21:47.648 --> 21:52.128
I love the smell of crab
meat in the morning.

21:52.129 --> 21:55.969
Say hello to my little umbrella.
