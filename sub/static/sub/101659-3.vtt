00:01.535 --> 00:03.971
Hello.
I'm Freddie Highmore.

00:04.105 --> 00:07.241
The following episode
portrays our hope
for the future,

00:07.375 --> 00:09.343
a future where no one
will have to wear masks

00:09.477 --> 00:12.280
or take other steps
to stay safe from COVID.

00:12.413 --> 00:15.283
Until then,
please protect yourself
and others.

00:18.686 --> 00:19.987
I'm Jordan Allen.

00:20.121 --> 00:22.190
My first year in med school,
I designed an ankle brace

00:22.323 --> 00:25.359
that monitors
extent of immobilization
via a phone app.

00:25.493 --> 00:26.994
When I licensed it
to Bioventus,

00:27.128 --> 00:29.463
I was able to pay off
over half my student loans.

00:31.099 --> 00:32.466
John Lundberg.

00:32.600 --> 00:35.303
I've worked every summer
since I was 16
at Camp Hope Heartland,

00:35.436 --> 00:37.671
a summer program for kids
with cancer in Des Moines,

00:37.805 --> 00:38.539
where I grew up.

00:39.140 --> 00:40.674
Asher Wolke.

00:40.808 --> 00:42.042
Uh, when I was 18,

00:42.176 --> 00:45.879
I left the Hasidic community
that I was raised in.

00:46.013 --> 00:47.648
I realized
if there really was a God,

00:47.781 --> 00:49.650
it had to be a cruel being

00:49.783 --> 00:52.052
that I felt nothing
but contempt for.

00:53.354 --> 00:55.189
That's also when I decided
to go to med school,

00:55.323 --> 00:56.524
and start dating men.

01:00.928 --> 01:04.398
I'm Olivia Jackson.
I'm 25.
From Chicago.

01:04.532 --> 01:05.499
(INHALES DEEPLY)

01:07.435 --> 01:09.570
I play ragtime piano
alone in my apartment.

01:12.340 --> 01:13.874
Is that interesting?

01:14.007 --> 01:15.609
Will Hooper.

01:15.743 --> 01:18.146
Technically,
I'm a professional athlete.

01:18.279 --> 01:20.047
Although in a sport
nobody pays attention to,

01:20.181 --> 01:22.616
and the stipend barely covers
our training expenses,

01:22.750 --> 01:25.519
but I'm on the US National
Rowing team.

01:26.187 --> 01:27.188
Men's Eight.

01:28.822 --> 01:31.525
Hey, I'm Enrique.

01:31.659 --> 01:33.861
I spent last summer
in Costa Rica,

01:33.994 --> 01:37.598
where I learned to surf,
which I'm totally obsessed
with now. (CHUCKLES)

01:37.731 --> 01:42.970
Uh, I had a pretty
interesting encounter
with a saltwater crocodile.

01:43.103 --> 01:44.538
I just thought it was a big...

01:44.672 --> 01:46.540
Why are you wearing
a swimsuit?

01:49.377 --> 01:51.212
Oh, they're actually
hybrid boardshorts.

01:52.045 --> 01:53.914
I like to work hard,

01:54.047 --> 01:55.416
and it's easier to do
when you're comfortable.

01:56.917 --> 02:00.621
Plus, I think
the casual dress
puts patients at ease.

02:00.754 --> 02:01.555
(CHUCKLES LIGHTLY)

02:05.426 --> 02:06.494
Uh...

02:06.627 --> 02:07.861
And Dr. Lim said
that the

02:08.862 --> 02:09.597
shorts were fine.

02:11.232 --> 02:14.468
Hospital policy
requires
all residents to...

02:14.602 --> 02:16.470
He's not a resident.
He's a resident
applicant.

02:16.604 --> 02:18.772
One of six finalists
for four openings.

02:18.906 --> 02:20.774
Now, they'll be
shadowing
for two days.

02:20.908 --> 02:22.476
Give them
the grand tour,
show them the ropes,

02:22.610 --> 02:23.644
feel free to
turn up the heat
a bit.

02:23.777 --> 02:24.978
See how they react
under pressure.

02:25.112 --> 02:27.615
You will be responsible
for supervising them,

02:27.748 --> 02:29.417
so I want your
totally honest input

02:29.550 --> 02:30.918
before I make
any final decisions.

02:31.051 --> 02:31.985
Those shorts...

02:32.119 --> 02:33.687
Let's call them
strike one.

02:33.821 --> 02:36.757
Oh, and in addition
to being an Olympian,

02:36.890 --> 02:38.326
Will Hooper is a Rhodes

02:38.459 --> 02:40.794
and graduated
top of his class
at Stanford.

02:40.928 --> 02:42.463
He is very handsome.

02:42.596 --> 02:43.964
He's very full of himself.

02:44.097 --> 02:45.999
He's ranked first
by every top program,

02:46.133 --> 02:48.569
so whatever you can do
to recruit him to ours,
do it.

02:48.702 --> 02:50.504
I can already give you
my input on the sh...

02:50.638 --> 02:52.105
Don't judge a book
by its boardshorts.

03:01.282 --> 03:02.316
(KNOCK ON DOOR)
(DOOR OPENS)

03:03.317 --> 03:04.552
DR. REZNICK:
You wanted
to see me?

03:04.685 --> 03:06.186
Good morning.

03:06.320 --> 03:08.121
Sorry.
Good morning.

03:08.256 --> 03:09.790
(DOOR CLOSES)
What'd I do wrong?

03:09.923 --> 03:10.958
Just wanted to check in.

03:11.091 --> 03:12.626
See how the new role
was coming along.

03:13.126 --> 03:13.827
Honestly?

03:16.430 --> 03:19.767
You could start our
new supervisor-resident
relationship with a lie.

03:19.900 --> 03:20.668
That's always fun.

03:22.936 --> 03:24.638
Internal medicine is

03:25.473 --> 03:26.474
boring.

03:27.741 --> 03:30.010
Between smokers
and obese diabetics,

03:30.143 --> 03:31.645
seems like all I'm doing
is protecting people
from themselves.

03:32.145 --> 03:33.146
(CHUCKLES)

03:35.483 --> 03:37.050
As a surgical resident,

03:37.184 --> 03:38.719
you never treated
drunk drivers?

03:38.852 --> 03:40.554
Or extracted
random objects
from guys'...

03:40.688 --> 03:42.556
I get it.
People are stupid.

03:42.690 --> 03:43.657
Not my point,
but true.

03:44.358 --> 03:45.359
(SIGHS)

03:46.694 --> 03:48.195
Not the same
adrenaline rush,

03:48.329 --> 03:50.664
but internal medicine
can be rewarding.

03:51.565 --> 03:53.667
Given time,
if you're patient.

03:55.303 --> 03:56.270
Thanks.

03:59.507 --> 04:01.342
That is not how
I thought this meeting
was gonna go.

04:03.010 --> 04:04.678
I thought
one of the nurses
complained about me.

04:04.812 --> 04:07.615
Wasn't just one.

04:07.748 --> 04:10.684
And if it happens again,
this meeting will go exactly
how you thought it would.

04:16.724 --> 04:17.691
(DOOR CLOSES)

04:24.197 --> 04:25.265
Sorry.

04:25.399 --> 04:26.700
I should've just
canceled
the appointment.

04:27.401 --> 04:28.736
You were right.

04:28.869 --> 04:30.070
Dizziness went away
as soon as I stopped

04:30.203 --> 04:31.472
drinking coffee
and Red Bull all day.

04:31.605 --> 04:32.606
No worries.

04:33.974 --> 04:35.075
Can you lie flat
on your back, please?

04:35.208 --> 04:35.943
Yeah.

04:37.478 --> 04:38.979
You get that scar
in a fire?

04:39.112 --> 04:40.080
Sort of.

04:40.213 --> 04:42.450
A homemade Roman candle
when I was 12.

04:42.583 --> 04:44.184
(CHUCKLES)
You'd be surprised

04:44.318 --> 04:46.954
how many of us
at the firehouse
were pyros as kids.

04:47.087 --> 04:49.690
I made a potato gun
for my sixth-grade
science fair.

04:49.823 --> 04:51.224
Almost got me
kicked out of school.

04:51.359 --> 04:52.793
You'll have to
come visit us
sometime.

04:52.926 --> 04:53.727
(INHALES SHARPLY)
You'd fit right in.

04:56.930 --> 04:58.065
JOSH:
You see something?

04:58.198 --> 04:59.800
Don't talk.
Just breathe normally.

04:59.933 --> 05:00.734
(MACHINE BEEPS)

05:04.672 --> 05:05.639
(MACHINE BEEPS)

05:08.241 --> 05:09.743
You have a large tumor
on the wall
of your heart.

05:11.379 --> 05:12.312
Cancer?

05:12.446 --> 05:13.847
I don't know.

05:13.981 --> 05:15.649
But you're definitely
gonna need surgery.

05:16.249 --> 05:17.150
As soon as possible.

05:19.052 --> 05:20.788
(THEME MUSIC PLAYING)

05:30.498 --> 05:32.466
I appreciate you letting me
share your case
with the whole class.

05:32.600 --> 05:34.101
MONICA:
No problem.

05:34.234 --> 05:36.169
I stopped being shy
after the 100th time
I had to do this.

05:36.303 --> 05:39.407
I'll be using a version
of Lejour's technique
I've adapted.

05:39.540 --> 05:41.542
We'll divide the breast
into three pedicles,

05:41.675 --> 05:43.143
and then
redistribute the tissue

05:43.276 --> 05:44.545
and insert
saline implants

05:44.678 --> 05:46.346
to correct the tuberous
breast deformity.

05:46.480 --> 05:49.216
Why would you want
breast implants?

05:49.349 --> 05:51.952
You're beautiful.
And your breasts look fine
just the way they are.

05:52.085 --> 05:53.687
No.
No, they don't.

05:53.821 --> 05:55.789
The base
is constricted,

05:55.923 --> 05:57.858
horizontal development
is deficient,

05:57.991 --> 05:59.493
and the nipple-areola
complex...

05:59.627 --> 06:01.695
Murphy.
It's okay.
He's right.

06:01.829 --> 06:02.796
That's why I'm here.

06:04.297 --> 06:05.999
Thank you.

06:06.133 --> 06:08.168
I know that
you're trying
to be nice.

06:08.301 --> 06:10.771
My friends and family
have been
telling me for years,

06:10.904 --> 06:12.540
"You're beautiful
just the way you are."

06:12.673 --> 06:14.708
But I don't
feel beautiful.

06:14.842 --> 06:16.977
You're 17.

06:17.110 --> 06:19.146
Every girl your age
feels like that.

06:19.279 --> 06:20.981
That can't
be true.

06:21.114 --> 06:23.383
Tuberous
breast deformity
is a rare condition.

06:23.517 --> 06:24.985
We're not
going to debate

06:25.118 --> 06:27.054
a personal decision
the patient's already made.

06:28.556 --> 06:31.525
I've been thinking
about this
since I was 13.

06:31.659 --> 06:33.561
Every time
I look in
the mirror.

06:33.694 --> 06:35.195
I'm about to
start college,

06:35.328 --> 06:37.898
and there is no way
that I'm gonna begin
this new chapter

06:38.031 --> 06:38.832
until I'm fixed.

06:40.701 --> 06:41.702
Great.

06:45.338 --> 06:48.008
You thinking
median sternotomy
or right thoracotomy?

06:48.141 --> 06:50.511
I'm thinking I should finish
my review of the imaging.

06:50.644 --> 06:51.845
Sure. No rush.

06:53.146 --> 06:54.848
Actually, there is
a bit of a rush.

06:54.982 --> 06:57.184
But you know
what I mean.

06:57.317 --> 06:59.419
So, newbies.
What up?
Where y'all from?

06:59.553 --> 07:00.554
Like hometowns,
or...

07:00.688 --> 07:01.889
Med schools.

07:02.022 --> 07:02.756
Why would I care
where you grew up?

07:02.890 --> 07:03.857
Stanford.

07:03.991 --> 07:05.392
Uh, NYU.
Harvard.

07:05.526 --> 07:06.226
Preferred specialties?

07:06.894 --> 07:08.361
Ortho. All the way.

07:08.496 --> 07:09.597
Neuro.

07:09.730 --> 07:11.131
I'm planning
a dual specialty

07:11.264 --> 07:12.833
in neonatal
and pediatric
oncology.

07:12.966 --> 07:14.201
Impressive. Also unlikely.

07:14.334 --> 07:16.036
I know,
it's a ton of work,

07:16.169 --> 07:17.605
but I'm pretty good
at multi-tasking.

07:17.738 --> 07:19.607
In med school, I did
a combined MD/PhD...

07:19.740 --> 07:21.274
What's your mom do?
My mom?

07:21.408 --> 07:22.876
Don't stall.
Just answer.

07:23.010 --> 07:23.877
She teaches
high-school French.

07:25.012 --> 07:26.213
Homemaker.

07:26.346 --> 07:27.280
Surgeon.

07:27.414 --> 07:28.882
Ouch. Dad?

07:29.016 --> 07:29.983
Also a surgeon.

07:30.117 --> 07:31.451
Double ouch.
And yours?

07:31.585 --> 07:32.720
Hasidic rabbi.

07:32.853 --> 07:33.887
You've left
the nest.

07:34.021 --> 07:36.189
Actually, the...
the whole forest.

07:36.323 --> 07:38.158
And yours obviously
works on Wall Street.

07:38.291 --> 07:39.860
But not a trader.

07:39.993 --> 07:42.095
I'm guessing...
an M&A lawyer?

07:42.229 --> 07:43.263
How'd you know?

07:43.396 --> 07:44.532
She's read
your resume,

07:44.665 --> 07:45.933
researched
your social media.

07:46.066 --> 07:47.935
She's probably run
a credit check, too.

07:48.068 --> 07:50.303
And you're under 50, but wear
Brooks Brothers button-downs.

07:50.437 --> 07:51.772
(MONITOR BEEPS)
Are you
done yet?

07:52.606 --> 07:53.941
Left thoracotomy

07:54.074 --> 07:56.610
with a possible incision
into the right atrium

07:56.744 --> 07:58.512
and inter-atrial
septum as needed.

07:58.646 --> 08:00.480
Left atrial approach
through Sondergaard's groove

08:00.614 --> 08:01.348
makes more sense.

08:01.915 --> 08:02.916
Not to me.

08:04.785 --> 08:05.786
He's my patient.

08:05.919 --> 08:07.454
But you're not
a surgeon.

08:07.588 --> 08:09.790
Which is why there is
no reason for you
to be grilling them,

08:09.923 --> 08:11.424
or picking
the approach.

08:11.559 --> 08:13.326
Stop worrying about
protecting your turf.

08:13.460 --> 08:14.494
Stop stepping
all over it.

08:14.628 --> 08:16.730
You're looking at tests
I did for my patient.

08:16.864 --> 08:18.231
How am I stepping
all over your turf?

08:18.365 --> 08:20.668
I think what Dr. Browne
is trying to say is,

08:20.801 --> 08:22.469
given there's no
perfect approach,

08:22.603 --> 08:23.637
maybe it's best
to defer

08:23.771 --> 08:25.138
to the surgical department's
recommendation.

08:26.774 --> 08:27.641
Did he just
mansplain?

08:29.009 --> 08:29.943
Not at all. I...
I was just trying...

08:30.077 --> 08:31.344
So you're just
gonna do it again?

08:31.478 --> 08:32.512
No, I'm just trying...

08:32.646 --> 08:33.413
BOTH: Shut up.

08:35.482 --> 08:36.984
We're gonna
go in through
a left thoracotomy.

08:37.985 --> 08:39.119
Not my preference,

08:39.252 --> 08:40.453
but it'll work.

08:42.723 --> 08:43.791
DR. ANDREWS:
What were you thinking?

08:43.924 --> 08:45.292
You thought
you'd impress me

08:45.425 --> 08:48.762
by undermining the patient's
confidence in my judgment?

08:48.896 --> 08:50.363
I'm sorry.
That wasn't my intent.

08:50.497 --> 08:52.165
And you're
supposed to be
a mentor now,

08:52.299 --> 08:53.867
modeling professional
behavior,

08:54.001 --> 08:55.969
not making it
worse, Murphy.

08:56.103 --> 08:58.471
She questioned
your surgical plan.

08:58.606 --> 08:59.740
I defended it.

08:59.873 --> 09:01.041
How can we both
be wrong?

09:01.174 --> 09:03.711
I don't need you
to defend me.

09:03.844 --> 09:07.147
And I never wanna
have a surgical debate
in front of a patient.

09:07.280 --> 09:08.982
We're not in front of
the patient now.

09:11.151 --> 09:13.721
The patient's breasts
are small
and a bit asymmetrical,

09:13.854 --> 09:15.856
but no woman's breasts
are perfectly shaped.

09:17.524 --> 09:20.794
You're wearing Prada shoes
and a Dolce & Gabbana blouse,

09:20.928 --> 09:22.529
which cost more
than most
med students' rent,

09:22.663 --> 09:24.497
so, clearly,
you understand

09:24.632 --> 09:27.234
your appearance has
a tremendous impact
on how people treat you.

09:27.367 --> 09:30.570
There's a difference
between nice clothes
and a major surgery.

09:32.339 --> 09:34.341
And I also understand
the cosmetic surgery industry

09:34.474 --> 09:37.477
is dominated
by male physicians
with a sexist bias.

09:44.852 --> 09:47.454
I've invited you to observe
as a learning opportunity.

09:48.856 --> 09:49.923
So I'd suggest

09:50.057 --> 09:51.158
less lecturing

09:51.291 --> 09:52.425
and more listening.

09:55.663 --> 09:57.364
We'll access the tumor
via an incision

09:57.497 --> 09:59.099
in the chest wall
between your ribs.

09:59.232 --> 10:00.367
It'll be
an easier recovery

10:00.500 --> 10:01.969
than if we opened
your sternum.

10:02.102 --> 10:04.537
Are you sure
you don't want us
to call your family

10:04.672 --> 10:05.605
before we put
you under?

10:05.739 --> 10:07.574
Why? So they can
freak out and worry?

10:07.708 --> 10:09.109
I'd rather just give them
the good news
when it's over.

10:11.178 --> 10:13.413
It is going to be
good news, right?

10:13.546 --> 10:15.783
With a bit of cardiac rehab
and a positive attitude,

10:15.916 --> 10:17.384
which I know you have,

10:17.517 --> 10:19.052
you'll be back sliding
down the fire pole
in no time.

10:19.853 --> 10:21.188
Our firehouse has stairs.

10:21.321 --> 10:22.422
Hmm. Bummer.

10:24.557 --> 10:25.893
LEA: It's a social
media group

10:26.026 --> 10:27.294
where we all
pretend to be ants.

10:28.395 --> 10:29.596
SHAUN: Why?

10:29.730 --> 10:33.266
Because ants don't
care about politics,
sports teams,

10:33.400 --> 10:35.402
or anything else people
get so savage about.

10:35.535 --> 10:38.438
Male ants
develop from
unfertilized eggs,

10:38.571 --> 10:41.608
which means
they don't have a father
and can't have sons.

10:41.742 --> 10:44.577
But they do have
grandfathers
and can have grandsons.

10:44.712 --> 10:45.412
Interesting.

10:45.545 --> 10:46.880
And confusing.

10:47.014 --> 10:50.283
Is it just me,
or are those doctors
watching us?

10:50.417 --> 10:52.820
They're the new
resident applicants.

10:52.953 --> 10:55.555
They're here so Park,
Claire, and I can
evaluate them for Dr. Lim.

10:56.824 --> 10:58.091
So, why are they
standing over there?

10:59.192 --> 11:01.729
Park had a video chat
with Kellan,

11:01.862 --> 11:03.731
and I had a real lunch
with you.

11:03.864 --> 11:08.268
Shaun, you can't just
have them stand there
while you eat.

11:08.401 --> 11:10.403
Part of being
a good boss is
being a good host.

11:10.537 --> 11:12.105
You need to
introduce them
to people.

11:14.775 --> 11:16.109
Like me. Right now.

11:18.979 --> 11:19.713
Come here,
please.

11:22.783 --> 11:24.852
Dr. Allen,
Dr. Lundberg,
Dr. Guerin,

11:24.985 --> 11:26.019
this is
my girlfriend,
Lea.

11:26.153 --> 11:27.154
She runs
the IT department now.

11:27.921 --> 11:29.122
Okay.

11:29.256 --> 11:31.424
Nice to meet you all.
Please join us.

11:31.558 --> 11:33.426
Shaun's been telling me
all about you.

11:33.560 --> 11:36.830
Mmm. N... No.
I haven't.

11:36.964 --> 11:40.033
So, I hope Shaun's
not being
too hard on you.

11:40.167 --> 11:42.169
No, he's been great.

11:42.302 --> 11:44.471
And the case
we're observing is
really interesting.

11:44.604 --> 11:47.707
We're correcting
a 17-year-old girl's
tuberous breasts

11:47.841 --> 11:49.342
with saline implants.

11:49.476 --> 11:52.012
Dr. Allen
told Dr. Andrews
it was unethical.

11:52.145 --> 11:53.346
He got mad.

11:53.480 --> 11:55.382
I didn't say
it was unethical.
I just...

11:57.484 --> 11:59.019
I suppose
I shouldn't have
interfered.

12:00.821 --> 12:03.156
Well, I don't know what
a tuberous breast is,

12:03.290 --> 12:05.058
but I think implants
are way overrated.

12:06.894 --> 12:09.496
That's because
your breasts
are excellent.

12:09.629 --> 12:10.530
Thank you.

12:11.598 --> 12:12.665
That's exactly my point.

12:13.801 --> 12:15.368
Mine aren't huge,

12:15.502 --> 12:17.737
but every guy
who's ever seen them
up close and personal

12:17.871 --> 12:18.638
has been thrilled.

12:19.840 --> 12:21.775
I definitely was.

12:21.909 --> 12:24.344
I am thrilled by
every part of your body.

12:27.214 --> 12:30.017
Sorry. My bad.
Total TMI.

12:30.150 --> 12:32.886
I'm not even bothered
by your adenoidal voice.

12:33.020 --> 12:35.055
Except when you talk
to your mom
on the phone.

12:35.188 --> 12:36.890
But I just put on
headphones.

12:42.129 --> 12:45.198
At least you'll know
he'll be
a totally honest boss.

12:48.201 --> 12:49.202
(MONITOR BEEPING)

12:51.972 --> 12:53.740
DR. REZNICK ON SPEAKER:
The incision's
extended superiorly

12:53.874 --> 12:55.408
to meet the atriotomy,

12:55.542 --> 12:58.111
and then the inter-atrial
septum is opened up.
Retractor.

12:58.245 --> 13:01.581
A Carpentier retractor
is used to visualize
the mitral valve.

13:01.714 --> 13:03.283
That will allow
a clear view
of the tumor.

13:03.416 --> 13:04.784
Can we turn
the channel?

13:04.918 --> 13:07.054
Color commentary's
getting a bit annoying.

13:07.187 --> 13:08.421
DR. REZNICK:
With the right atrium
opened obliq...

13:09.089 --> 13:10.090
(SIGHS)

13:11.224 --> 13:13.861
How's Team Browne?
Any early standouts?

13:13.994 --> 13:16.296
Jackson's a bit timid,
but smart.

13:16.429 --> 13:18.798
Wolke is definitely
enthusiastic.

13:18.932 --> 13:21.301
And your star recruit is...

13:21.434 --> 13:22.802
(INHALES DEEPLY)

13:22.936 --> 13:23.803
pretty full
of himself.

13:25.205 --> 13:27.340
I'm looking for surgeons,
and according to his recs,

13:27.474 --> 13:29.809
he can dissect
and suture
like a pro.

13:29.943 --> 13:32.345
I thought you were also
looking for our input.

13:32.479 --> 13:34.681
He's ranked first
by every top program.

13:34.814 --> 13:36.149
You really think
they're all wrong
and you're right?

13:39.686 --> 13:41.588
So, what brings you
all to the biz?

13:41.721 --> 13:43.924
Had my ACL
reconstructed
in high school,

13:44.057 --> 13:45.492
both my rotators
in college.

13:46.593 --> 13:48.428
I love the idea
of fixing people,

13:48.561 --> 13:50.330
helping them
be the best
they can be.

13:51.932 --> 13:53.934
Surgeons are the ones
with the God complex,
right?

13:56.803 --> 13:57.537
I have that.

13:59.806 --> 14:02.409
I spent my life
speaking Yiddish
and studying the Talmud,

14:02.542 --> 14:04.277
and not shaving
the sides of my hair,

14:04.411 --> 14:06.046
because someone up there
supposedly cares.

14:07.114 --> 14:08.315
Uh, but then
I realized

14:10.417 --> 14:11.284
no one's up there.

14:12.920 --> 14:15.088
No one cares.

14:15.222 --> 14:18.791
No benevolent higher power
is going to save us, so...

14:18.926 --> 14:20.360
(INHALES DEEPLY)

14:20.493 --> 14:21.494
We have to save
each other.

14:24.731 --> 14:26.166
Can you top that?

14:26.299 --> 14:28.835
Definitely not.
Try anyway.

14:28.969 --> 14:32.139
You're obviously smart.
You've got two degrees
from Harvard.

14:32.272 --> 14:34.107
My parents are
Harvard alums,
so...

14:34.241 --> 14:35.442
I'm sure that
helped me get in.

14:35.575 --> 14:37.010
You're not gonna get
hired by undermining
your own...

14:38.578 --> 14:40.547
Something
went wrong.

14:40.680 --> 14:41.848
OLIVIA: Looks like
they nicked
a pulmonary artery.

14:41.982 --> 14:44.084
No. If they had,
Browne would
be suctioning

14:44.217 --> 14:45.318
instead of Lim
reaching in
with her hands.

14:50.023 --> 14:51.158
ASHER: What are
they doing now?

14:51.959 --> 14:52.926
Nothing.

14:53.994 --> 14:55.195
We can't access
the tumor

14:55.328 --> 14:57.364
without compromising
his entire cardiac
outflow tract.

14:57.497 --> 15:00.067
What about going in
the way I suggested?
The median sternotomy.

15:00.200 --> 15:02.035
The tumor's too far back.
We need to close him up.

15:10.710 --> 15:13.280
Proton beam radiation
would be too toxic
to the heart.

15:13.413 --> 15:15.248
DR. LIM:
So is immunotherapy.

15:15.382 --> 15:17.517
We can't access
the entire
tumor surgically,

15:17.650 --> 15:20.520
and we can't kill it
without killing his heart
along with it.

15:20.653 --> 15:22.455
What if we cut out
the parts
we can access

15:22.589 --> 15:25.725
and try our luck
with chemo
on what's left?

15:25.858 --> 15:29.129
IV doxorubicin
and ifosfamide
might slow the growth,

15:29.262 --> 15:30.663
give him
a few more months.

15:30.797 --> 15:32.899
No, I'm not sending
my patient home with
just a few extra months.

15:33.033 --> 15:34.067
It's better
than nothing.

15:34.201 --> 15:35.568
What about
a transplant?

15:35.702 --> 15:36.736
Not an option.

15:36.869 --> 15:38.972
Heart tumors are
a contraindication.

15:39.106 --> 15:41.541
What if
we transplant
his own heart?

15:41.674 --> 15:43.276
If we take it totally
out of his chest,

15:43.410 --> 15:45.112
we'd have access
to the posterior heart.

15:45.245 --> 15:46.279
We could excise
the tumor,

15:46.413 --> 15:47.447
fix the defect
it left behind,

15:47.580 --> 15:48.948
and then
put it back in.
Cool.

15:49.082 --> 15:50.517
CLAIRE: Mmm.
Not cool.

15:50.650 --> 15:52.119
At least
with a normal
heart transplant,

15:52.252 --> 15:53.786
you'd be getting
a healthy heart.

15:53.920 --> 15:56.289
Her idea keeps the risk
of removing the heart,

15:56.423 --> 15:58.791
and adds the risk
that the heart
we'd be putting back in

15:58.925 --> 16:00.327
has just been
severely compromised

16:00.460 --> 16:02.262
having had a tumor
cut out of it.

16:02.395 --> 16:05.098
He's young, and the part
of his heart not infiltrated
with tumor is strong.

16:08.768 --> 16:12.572
Do a cardiac MRA and see
if the tumor's infiltrated
the coronary arteries.

16:12.705 --> 16:14.274
If it hasn't,
Morgan's idea
could work.

16:14.407 --> 16:15.408
I'll schedule it.

16:18.978 --> 16:21.048
DR. ANDREWS:
Dr. Murphy is dividing
the breast parenchyma

16:21.181 --> 16:22.915
into three pedicles.

16:23.050 --> 16:25.118
Anyone know
where this technique
is derived from?

16:25.252 --> 16:26.419
Breast reduction surgery.

16:26.986 --> 16:28.621
That's right.

16:28.755 --> 16:31.924
And why would I use
a breast reduction
technique

16:32.059 --> 16:34.161
to make the patient's
breasts larger?

16:34.294 --> 16:35.495
The technique
frees up the tissue.

16:36.629 --> 16:38.231
You can bring
the pedicles together

16:38.365 --> 16:39.632
to make
the breasts smaller

16:39.766 --> 16:42.602
or spread them out
over an implant
to make them larger.

16:44.071 --> 16:45.205
DR. ANDREWS:
Very good.

16:45.338 --> 16:47.974
And now I'm going to
turn the sound off.

16:48.108 --> 16:49.509
Don't worry.
Nothing's wrong.

16:49.642 --> 16:51.478
I just wanna talk about
you behind your backs
for a little bit.

16:54.147 --> 16:55.615
So, first impressions.

16:56.249 --> 16:57.350
Murphy?

16:57.484 --> 16:59.119
I like
Dr. John Lundberg.

17:00.587 --> 17:02.189
DR. ANDREWS:
I haven't even
heard him speak yet.

17:02.322 --> 17:04.157
He has the highest
U.S.M.L.E. scores.

17:04.291 --> 17:05.292
And that's important
to you?

17:06.493 --> 17:07.460
(SOFTLY) Yes.

17:08.795 --> 17:11.030
It shows he has
a broad knowledge
of medicine.

17:12.299 --> 17:14.867
What is important
to you?

17:15.001 --> 17:17.870
Well, I'm more interested
in what they can do
with their knowledge,

17:18.004 --> 17:21.007
which is why, so far,
I'm most impressed
with Jordan Allen.

17:21.141 --> 17:25.145
No. No, you said
she undermined you.

17:25.278 --> 17:29.382
Which takes courage
and an assertiveness
that will serve her well.

17:29.516 --> 17:32.685
Then why did you tell her
to stop lecturing you?

17:32.819 --> 17:35.288
It's easier to teach
an aggressive
resident restraint

17:35.422 --> 17:37.224
than a passive one
to assert themselves.

17:37.357 --> 17:38.358
Oh.

17:40.460 --> 17:42.429
What about you, Park?
What's important to you?

17:42.562 --> 17:45.265
I wanna know who I can
stand to be around
for 80 hours a week.

17:45.398 --> 17:46.833
One thing
I learned as a cop,

17:46.966 --> 17:48.335
you don't really
know a person

17:48.468 --> 17:49.736
until you've had
a few drinks
with them.

17:55.175 --> 17:56.909
(MACHINE WHIRRING)

DR. REZNICK:
LAD and circumflex
look clean.

17:58.645 --> 18:00.613
CLAIRE: What's with
the right coronary?

18:00.747 --> 18:02.115
It looks narrowed
at the origin.

18:03.650 --> 18:05.585
It's a bit narrow,
but looks like
a normal variant.

18:05.718 --> 18:07.154
Yeah, but it seems hazy,

18:07.287 --> 18:09.756
like there could be
some tumor infiltration.

18:11.391 --> 18:12.125
What do
you guys think?

18:12.759 --> 18:14.060
Us?
Yeah.

18:14.194 --> 18:14.927
Come take
a look.

18:18.231 --> 18:19.466
I guess...

18:19.599 --> 18:20.533
It's angiogenesis

Stop.

18:22.469 --> 18:23.703
Interrupting
a female coworker

18:23.836 --> 18:26.038
is almost as annoying
as mansplaining.

18:26.173 --> 18:27.340
This isn't
a rowing race.

18:27.474 --> 18:28.908
You don't always
have to speak first.

18:30.577 --> 18:34.414
I... do not love
the interruption.

18:35.982 --> 18:36.949
But...

18:37.850 --> 18:38.951
I like the enthusiasm.

18:41.087 --> 18:41.921
What were you
gonna say?

18:43.690 --> 18:45.558
First, um,
I'm not sexist.

18:47.260 --> 18:48.761
Of course not.

at a hospital
in Borneo?

uh, but when we got him
to the hospital,

21:16.809 --> 21:18.711

heart damage

when we ran

21:28.521 --> 21:30.122
Good catch.

21:30.256 --> 21:33.426
But a scan that extensive
requires multiple

could handle that?

29:30.336 --> 29:31.637
DR. PARK:
I can, but why?

29:31.770 --> 29:34.073
We're worried about
her heart and
metabolic abnormalities.

29:35.074 --> 29:37.709
We shouldn't be.
Not anymore.

29:37.844 --> 29:40.579
You and Dr. Murphy
were both wrong.

29:40.712 --> 29:43.749
She doesn't have
a cardiac
or metabolic issue.

29:43.883 --> 29:46.452
She has poor blood flow
in the artery supplying blood

29:46.585 --> 29:48.187
to the area of her brain
that controls consciousness.

29:48.320 --> 29:51.390
A small clot in her
artery of Percheron.

29:51.523 --> 29:54.593
If we don't remove it fast,
she's never going to wake up.

That's amazing.

30:08.274 --> 30:10.442
No, it's not.

30:10.576 --> 30:13.645
The heart's totally
outside of the body
and still beating.

30:13.779 --> 30:15.681
It's like it has
a mind of its own.

30:15.814 --> 30:18.217
She should've started
the reimplantation
by now.

30:18.350 --> 30:19.919
Is everything okay,
Dr. Lim?

30:20.052 --> 30:22.621
DR. LIM: The tumor
had tendrils invading
the right atrial wall.

30:22.754 --> 30:24.857
We took
so much tissue to
get a clear margin,

30:24.991 --> 30:28.160
there's not enough left
to reconstruct his
heart's inflow chambers.

30:28.294 --> 30:29.828
How about
expanded
PTFE graft?

30:29.962 --> 30:31.797
There's not enough
atrial remnant
to attach the graft.

30:31.931 --> 30:33.399
You could use
the septal wall.

30:33.532 --> 30:35.167
He's got
dense conduction
fibers there.

30:35.301 --> 30:36.969
It could cause
heart arrhythmias.
Not if you use...

30:37.103 --> 30:38.270
(MONITOR BEEPS RAPIDLY)
He's got low
arterial pressure.

30:39.638 --> 30:41.273
He's springing leaks
at the cannulation sites.

30:41.407 --> 30:43.209
It's a bleeding disorder
caused by prolonged bypass.

30:43.342 --> 30:44.944
You need to
get his heart
back in ASAP.

30:45.077 --> 30:47.646
Morgan, we can't
put the heart back in
with two missing chambers.

30:55.821 --> 30:57.189
DR. ANDREWS:
(DISTORTED)
It's a rare complication,

30:57.323 --> 30:59.658
but a blood clot is
a risk in any surgery.

30:59.791 --> 31:01.360
DR. PARK:
It's too deep in the brain
for open surgery.

31:01.493 --> 31:02.895
If we go rooting around
in there,

31:03.029 --> 31:05.831
we'd definitely damage
the PCA
and kill her.

31:05.965 --> 31:08.334
We could inject
a dissolving agent
into the clot.

31:08.467 --> 31:12.905
There's a 50% probability
it won't fully dissolve,

31:13.039 --> 31:15.641
which could leave her
with permanent weakness
and cognitive difficulties.

31:15.774 --> 31:17.376
JORDAN: Assuming
she wakes up at all.

31:22.281 --> 31:25.117
We need to remove the clot
with a stent retriever.

31:27.653 --> 31:29.521
If we rupture
the posterior
cerebral artery,

31:29.655 --> 31:31.023
she'll die on the table.

31:33.325 --> 31:35.027
Or total recovery.

31:36.662 --> 31:38.530
That's how she came
into this hospital.

31:38.664 --> 31:40.232
That's how she's leaving.

has the right compliance

31:57.116 --> 31:58.684
to shape
the chamber walls, but...

31:58.817 --> 32:00.352
There isn't enough
to cover
that much area.

32:00.486 --> 32:02.754
Use too little
and he'll have heart
failure in a month.

32:02.888 --> 32:04.723

That's the "but."

32:04.856 --> 32:05.958
How thick is
his deep fascia?

32:06.092 --> 32:06.858
If it's over
2 millimeters...

32:06.993 --> 32:07.994
DR. LIM: Morgan.

32:08.794 --> 32:10.162
Get out.

32:10.296 --> 32:11.697
I'm sorry. I'll...
I'll be quiet.

32:11.830 --> 32:12.931
No, you won't.
You can't.

32:13.065 --> 32:14.033
So leave
the OR gallery.

32:16.735 --> 32:17.736
Now.

32:24.343 --> 32:27.779
We need 2.6-millimeter-thick

and contractile pressures.

32:30.416 --> 32:33.552
If it was just the valve,
we'd use a bovine
pericardial graft.

32:33.685 --> 32:37.389
But cow heart tissue
is not durable enough
to do an entire chamber.

32:37.523 --> 32:39.958
But pig bladder tissue
is just right.

32:40.092 --> 32:43.229
I've used it for bladder
reconstructive surgeries,
but never hearts.

She only has one vessel

would make her feel good.

I made her feel insecure,

interview.

41:30.922 --> 41:32.924
And also do
a little experiment.

41:33.559 --> 41:34.560
(LAUGHS)

41:36.061 --> 41:36.928
So...

41:37.996 --> 41:42.433
It's Jordan, Asher,

41:42.568 --> 41:44.770
Olivia, and Enrique.

41:47.839 --> 41:50.475
To the next phase
of your surgical training.

41:50.609 --> 41:52.110
You helped pick them.

41:52.243 --> 41:54.913
As senior residents,
it's now your job
to help train them.

41:55.046 --> 41:57.082
And don't take this
responsibility lightly,

41:57.215 --> 41:58.516
because if you don't
train them well,

41:59.450 --> 42:00.185
people will die.

42:12.297 --> 42:14.032
