02:49.367 --> 02:50.561
Sorry, Bullock.

03:17.647 --> 03:21.879
You abide me beside you,
20 paces or so? 

03:28.607 --> 03:30.438
Yankton's man is among us.

03:32.527 --> 03:34.518
Even under the circumstances...

03:35.727 --> 03:38.719
he may try you to confirm we're allied.

03:39.807 --> 03:40.956
If he does...

03:42.607 --> 03:44.802
your nod would advance the cause.

03:46.087 --> 03:47.156
All right.

04:04.447 --> 04:07.325
Yeah, you fat fuck, you're alive.

04:10.047 --> 04:11.526
Let me die.

04:12.167 --> 04:14.556
What is that, "thank you" in whale talk?

04:17.567 --> 04:19.637
- Drink this.
- No.

04:20.207 --> 04:21.685
Drink it.

04:42.127 --> 04:46.086
Get up, get the doc,
and tell him he's got a live one.

04:46.167 --> 04:49.079
Tell him, too,
his rupture patient left here...

04:49.167 --> 04:51.442
to convalesce at his own fucking place.

04:51.647 --> 04:55.242
You gave him a shoulder to lean on
as he was getting the fuck out.

05:02.567 --> 05:06.480
Next time he opens his eyes, he's
gonna think he died and went to heaven.

06:43.207 --> 06:44.322
Cocksucker!

06:44.607 --> 06:48.043
Yeah, San Francisco cocksucker, Wu.
Your mortal fucking enemy.

06:48.127 --> 06:50.561
- Swearengen.
- Wu.

06:50.647 --> 06:52.000
Swearengen.

06:52.207 --> 06:54.482
Yeah, I make these
as burnt-up whores...

06:54.567 --> 06:57.764
that I smelt on the char this morning
with your San Francisco rival...

06:57.847 --> 06:59.519
turning the fucking spit.

06:59.767 --> 07:01.917
- Swearengen fucking knows.
- Swearengen know.

07:02.007 --> 07:05.204
I know about the burnt-up whores,
I know about the San Francisco...

07:05.287 --> 07:07.084
cocksucker setting a match to them.

07:07.167 --> 07:09.920
Now, here's the part
you gotta listen to, Wu.

07:10.487 --> 07:13.206
- Chung Kuo.
- Is "China. "

07:13.287 --> 07:16.484
- Chung Kuo, "China. "
- Yeah, Chung Kuo, "China. "

07:16.847 --> 07:21.716
Celestial whores in the fire. What?
Their spirits are fucking...

07:21.887 --> 07:24.276
nothing, if their bones
don't get back home? Is that it?

07:24.367 --> 07:26.198
And do you come to me
to back your move...

07:26.287 --> 07:28.164
against your
San Francisco cocksucker rival?

07:28.247 --> 07:29.760
Am I getting
the fucking drift to you, Wu?

07:29.847 --> 07:32.236
- Swearengen!
- Swearengen fucking gets it!

07:32.407 --> 07:35.444
Swearengen doesn't give a fuck!

07:36.647 --> 07:40.242
Back to Chinks' Alley, Wu.
Fall to your fucking prayers.

07:42.727 --> 07:45.321
I can use the plate
if you want to leave that.

08:10.327 --> 08:13.399
Why don't I back him?

08:14.567 --> 08:17.127
'Cause Hearst is
in the other Chink's corner.

08:17.327 --> 08:19.397
Meaning Wu has to lose.

08:22.447 --> 08:24.358
Wouldn't be the worst thing.

08:26.407 --> 08:28.204
Backing a loser to Hearst.

08:28.447 --> 08:33.123
Let him pick me up from the canvas
after, dust me the fuck off.

08:33.527 --> 08:35.995
I raise the great man's hand...

08:36.447 --> 08:39.883
murmur, best as I can through split lips:

08:40.087 --> 08:45.081
"Your man beat my man's balls off,
Mr Hearst. "

08:48.927 --> 08:50.406
But Hearst's Chink...

08:50.647 --> 08:55.004
bossing that alley
ain't to my fucking taste.

08:57.767 --> 09:01.043
So what if something delays
the battle of the Chinks?

09:01.207 --> 09:05.200
Say, during that interval I get to show
my ass a few times to Mr Hearst.

09:05.287 --> 09:07.801
Meanwhile, that pain in the balls,
Wu, is sketching up a storm...

09:07.887 --> 09:10.685
and drawing fucking little pictures of
himself brandishing the lash...

09:10.767 --> 09:14.237
driving from a delivery ship a quota
of Chinks to be blown to pieces...

09:14.327 --> 09:16.443
by dynamite working
in the mines for Hearst...

09:16.527 --> 09:21.237
at half the fee per Chink that Hearst
is paying the San Francisco cocksucker.

09:21.327 --> 09:23.966
Now, by this time, Hearst
has seen my ass so many times...

09:24.047 --> 09:25.765
he knows I'm no long-term threat.

09:25.847 --> 09:28.042
So, some brief opposition
of our interests...

09:28.127 --> 09:29.560
ain't gonna make him
feel like he needs...

09:29.647 --> 09:34.641
to engage me in a death struggle,
say, by opposing local elections.

09:35.367 --> 09:39.645
Those circumstances
we can risk backing Wu...

09:39.887 --> 09:41.684
and the great man figures:

09:41.767 --> 09:43.997
"I am damaged by neither outcome.

09:44.207 --> 09:47.165
"Why not retire to a neutral corner...

09:47.567 --> 09:49.637
"and test my import against the locals?"

09:49.727 --> 09:51.877
What delays Wu going after
the other Chink?

09:51.967 --> 09:55.243
- Or the other Chink going after Wu?
- That, too.

09:55.327 --> 09:59.605
Well, if the other Chink can
be dissuaded, Wu, we can put on ice.

10:00.167 --> 10:02.840
Well, how do we dissuade
the other Chink?

10:03.127 --> 10:06.164
I suppose laying eyes on him
would be the first step.

10:10.127 --> 10:13.437
My only question is,
push comes to shove...

10:14.527 --> 10:17.360
wearing them Chinese dresses...

10:18.487 --> 10:20.398
how well can you ladies fight?

10:24.407 --> 10:25.965
You're staying, Adams.

10:30.527 --> 10:33.485
Cheyenne and Black Hills
Telegraph Company.

10:33.967 --> 10:35.480
Telegrams for delivery.

10:35.567 --> 10:39.276
Mr Blasanov. On our day of grief.

10:43.367 --> 10:45.722
Our acquaintance
is established, Blasanov...

10:45.807 --> 10:47.718
and for my part, our friendship.

10:47.807 --> 10:49.559
- Thank you.
- You needn't announce yourself...

10:49.647 --> 10:51.365
every morning, and your purpose.

10:51.447 --> 10:55.884
May I suggest, as well, that rather than
you delivering your telegrams upstairs...

10:56.087 --> 11:00.603
interrupting the rest, or secret
depravities, of well-armed guests...

11:01.007 --> 11:03.237
I could distribute them
in these pigeonholes...

11:03.327 --> 11:05.795
to be collected by the guests
at their leisure?

11:05.887 --> 11:07.479
I am not permitted.

11:08.927 --> 11:13.637
A man must put bread on his table,
Mr Blasanov, I well understand.

11:13.887 --> 11:18.881
Suppose, to compensate you for lost
gratuities, I were to pay you $5 a day?

11:23.607 --> 11:27.156
Cheyenne and Black Hills
Telegraph Company...

11:27.287 --> 11:29.960
requires personal delivery by Blasanov.

11:30.087 --> 11:32.123
I am not permitted.

11:36.767 --> 11:41.522
Yet avarice is numbered among
the sins, and stupidity omitted.

11:42.887 --> 11:46.118
- No Gem whores at the railings today.
- Why not?

11:46.287 --> 11:48.437
Al won't permit them on the balcony.

11:49.047 --> 11:51.561
He lets them on, they'll be leaping off.

11:52.407 --> 11:55.524
Very dramatic we get,
at the passing of the fucking young.

11:55.727 --> 11:57.638
Yesterday was a terrible day.

11:58.047 --> 12:00.800
Do not even fucking ask me
to account for my coming here...

12:00.887 --> 12:03.117
advising you how to answer Ellsworth.

12:04.647 --> 12:07.605
You haven't changed your opinion,
have you, Trixie...

12:08.007 --> 12:11.158
as to my accepting
Ellsworth's marriage proposal?

12:11.807 --> 12:13.365
My new opinion is...

12:14.047 --> 12:17.198
few choices, as are ours to make...

12:17.287 --> 12:20.040
others should stay
the fuck out of the process.

12:24.687 --> 12:27.121
Quiet like that since the boy's accident?

13:00.687 --> 13:04.077
Cheyenne and Black Hills Telegraph.
Telegram for Mr Wolcott.

13:04.167 --> 13:06.681
- How are you today, Mr Blasanov?
- Thank you.

13:18.687 --> 13:22.316
- Telegram for Mr Jarry.
- Yes, I am he.

13:23.527 --> 13:24.676
Thank you.

13:40.487 --> 13:44.560
You've packed your things.
Thrown them, it looks like.

13:46.687 --> 13:48.439
What is it you wish to say?

13:49.527 --> 13:53.918
That I'd hope in the throes of this day
you'd not make any final decision.

13:54.687 --> 13:56.325
I can't bear to stay.

14:03.807 --> 14:06.275
The minister's here
to discuss the service.

14:15.127 --> 14:16.242
Reverend.

14:17.447 --> 14:19.517
Mrs Bullock, my deep sympathies...

14:19.607 --> 14:22.201
which I conveyed
to your husband last evening.

14:22.407 --> 14:23.556
Thank you.

14:23.687 --> 14:27.999
You wish to discuss William's service.

14:28.287 --> 14:32.803
I suggested to Mr Bullock that
we hold service in front of the house.

14:32.887 --> 14:33.922
That would be fine.

14:34.007 --> 14:36.237
As to the substance of the service...

14:36.327 --> 14:40.366
do you wish psalms,
a reading, my words...

14:40.447 --> 14:44.281
hymns, chosen speakers in memoriam,
a second reading-

14:44.367 --> 14:46.927
- Let the service be brief.
- Yes.

14:47.127 --> 14:48.242
Certainly.

14:50.247 --> 14:52.920
Do you wish to provide me
a detail or two of William?

14:53.007 --> 14:54.406
I don't want that.

14:55.447 --> 14:58.086
Do you have a favourite reading?
Did he?

15:00.087 --> 15:02.157
- You choose something.
- Certainly.

15:02.247 --> 15:04.397
And you'll announce that
the burial is private?

15:04.487 --> 15:05.556
I will.

15:09.207 --> 15:12.643
Will there, then, be a passing-by
of the casket after the service?

15:12.727 --> 15:13.955
No!

15:15.567 --> 15:18.843
- Certainly.
- Thank you, Reverend.

15:57.007 --> 16:00.283
My condolences, Sheriff.
My deepest sympathies.

16:00.367 --> 16:03.803
The answer is yes, Commissioner.
What you wanna know.

16:04.287 --> 16:06.926
Having to do with Mr Swearengen
speaking with your voice.

16:07.007 --> 16:09.805
Yes. That's all, now.

16:10.207 --> 16:13.438
My reluctance to intrude
nearly kept me from coming at all.

16:24.727 --> 16:26.558
Mose Manuel made it through.

16:27.727 --> 16:32.403
- Thank heavens.
- The doc fixed Con's rupture, too.

16:34.367 --> 16:35.766
Go shoot some dope.

16:35.847 --> 16:38.805
Thank you, sir.
It's been a hell of a trying evening.

16:41.407 --> 16:45.286
I have a cheque for $50,000...

16:45.527 --> 16:47.483
I'd like to cash with you.

16:48.327 --> 16:51.478
I show that courtesy to people
who gamble in my joint.

16:51.567 --> 16:54.001
I wish to afford you, Mr Tolliver,
a chance to show...

16:54.127 --> 16:57.881
my colleagues in Yankton that you are
not blinded by parochial rivalry...

16:57.967 --> 17:00.561
as to what the greater good requires.

17:01.367 --> 17:04.757
You'd deliver the 50 to Swearengen?

17:04.847 --> 17:08.044
Who'd no doubt prefer the cheque,
to have the bribe on record.

17:08.127 --> 17:11.756
So, this ain't you just being a twitch...

17:11.847 --> 17:14.599
who likes rubbing people's noses
in their losses.

17:15.926 --> 17:18.839
Shall we transact our business
in the cage, Mr Tolliver...

17:18.926 --> 17:23.478
where I was attacked the other day,
and you failed to come to my aid?

17:32.407 --> 17:34.967
I see you made it
through the fucking night.

17:37.967 --> 17:39.366
Jesus fucking Christ.

17:39.447 --> 17:43.725
This is gonna be a pleasant fucking day,
them wailing and gnashing their teeth.

17:43.847 --> 17:45.997
Will they be allowed
to pay their respects?

17:46.087 --> 17:49.523
- By who?
- By you, most importantly, as always.

17:49.607 --> 17:52.075
And should you,
in your greatness, consent...

17:52.167 --> 17:54.317
will he let them in his fucking house?

17:54.407 --> 17:55.760
I won't object...

17:56.047 --> 17:59.926
but it's yours to keep them she-apes
from disgracing me.

18:00.007 --> 18:03.443
As to Bullock's feelings,
get the Jew to find them out.

18:04.167 --> 18:06.886
Should I ask about you also?

18:09.887 --> 18:12.924
What the fuck
would I wanna go there for?

18:21.327 --> 18:24.205
Shut the fuck up!

18:35.807 --> 18:37.160
Hot!

18:38.047 --> 18:39.116
Hot!

18:42.567 --> 18:46.082
I mean I know what it's supposed to
be, but I ain't fucking used to it.

18:46.167 --> 18:47.600
Well, maybe wait a little.

18:47.687 --> 18:50.838
Yeah, I'll wait a little bit
before I fucking get in.

18:53.167 --> 18:55.283
Did it ever occur to you strange...

18:55.527 --> 18:59.520
bathing in a tub you've dirtied,
coming out thinking you're clean?

19:00.007 --> 19:03.556
- You need a bath, Jane.
- And I'm gonna fucking take it!

19:04.207 --> 19:06.641
I'm raising a general fucking question.

19:08.487 --> 19:10.717
If you want boots different
from your regular-

19:10.807 --> 19:13.958
No, I do not.
I will clean my fucking regular boots.

19:14.647 --> 19:18.117
- Shouldn't you do that before your bath?
- No! Turn around!

19:18.687 --> 19:19.961
Don't go!

19:29.847 --> 19:32.839
Dumb fucking luck it must have been
me living this long...

19:32.927 --> 19:35.077
without your fucking guidance.

19:35.167 --> 19:37.078
I don't like new boots, either.

19:39.247 --> 19:41.317
I ain't afraid of newness...

19:42.447 --> 19:44.563
it's the blisters give me pause.

19:47.447 --> 19:50.086
God, I burnt my fucking snatch!

19:51.127 --> 19:54.563
- Or funerals.
- Or funerals, what?

19:54.767 --> 19:56.723
Any more than I like new boots.

19:58.567 --> 20:03.243
- I don't like funerals.
- I do! I do! I can't get to enough of them!

20:27.127 --> 20:28.242
Trixie.

20:33.407 --> 20:35.796
He'd have me ask, might the whores...

20:37.287 --> 20:39.482
pay the dead boy their respects?

20:39.807 --> 20:43.436
The service is outside the home.
All in the camp are welcome.

20:43.527 --> 20:45.802
They'd be sure to keep to their place.

20:46.327 --> 20:47.919
Why did you go to him?

20:50.527 --> 20:55.362
Now, hold to this counter
as I reveal this, Mr Star.

20:55.927 --> 21:00.239
I've lived most of my life a whore,
and as much as he's her misery...

21:00.967 --> 21:02.844
the pimp's a whore's familiar.

21:03.927 --> 21:07.124
So, the sudden strange or violent
draws her to him.

21:09.127 --> 21:11.402
Not that I wouldn't learn another way.

21:13.327 --> 21:16.444
- You look fucking mournful.
- Even more.

21:18.607 --> 21:22.600
Sad day, gentlemen,
on which commerce must intrude.

21:22.687 --> 21:24.598
Says who that it must?

21:25.447 --> 21:27.722
Because of the death
of the Sheriff's son.

21:27.807 --> 21:30.367
You need to ask,
you don't deserve an answer.

21:30.607 --> 21:33.167
I should say
that even in his hour of grief...

21:33.247 --> 21:37.445
Sheriff Bullock conveyed to me
his reliance on you as his proxy.

21:38.447 --> 21:40.165
And, as his proxy...

21:40.687 --> 21:44.475
I don't do business on the day
of my godson's passing.

21:45.327 --> 21:47.682
I'm compelled to wonder,
Mr Swearengen...

21:47.767 --> 21:52.716
if this show of grief is a pretext
to some other purpose.

21:56.807 --> 21:59.241
What a type you must consort with...

21:59.727 --> 22:02.719
that you not fear beating
for such an insult.

22:03.207 --> 22:05.801
If Montana, for example...

22:06.007 --> 22:08.680
had sweetened the terms
in annexing this camp...

22:08.767 --> 22:11.918
and you'd delay the closing
of our business not for piety...

22:12.007 --> 22:13.963
but to pursue your other negotiations-

22:14.047 --> 22:16.800
Leave here with your
sick fucking ghoulish thinking.

22:16.887 --> 22:19.481
I'll have further instructions
within the day.

22:19.767 --> 22:21.280
If not honour...

22:21.447 --> 22:25.201
practicality dictates granting Yankton
further counter.

22:25.287 --> 22:28.006
You come back here offering
one more dollar than that 50...

22:28.087 --> 22:30.760
you'll find yourself facedown
in the horseshit.

22:30.847 --> 22:34.362
But you would entertain
enhancement of the offer...

22:34.927 --> 22:36.360
other than cash?

22:37.087 --> 22:40.841
I do not discuss business
on this day. Silas.

22:41.727 --> 22:44.605
You're buying yourself
a fucking bum's rush, Commissioner.

22:44.687 --> 22:47.645
When Mr Swearengen says go,
he means it.

22:47.727 --> 22:49.604
All right. All right.

22:50.287 --> 22:52.403
I'm not without imagination.

22:52.927 --> 22:56.886
A counter without currency
is in the offing.

23:04.687 --> 23:06.040
Go over there with that guy.

23:09.047 --> 23:10.924
You do remember me, Andy?

23:12.967 --> 23:15.162
Three times we worked together.

23:15.287 --> 23:19.997
Memphis, and on the river,
and in Kansas City.

23:20.567 --> 23:24.003
And we were meant to here,
but you fell ill.

23:25.207 --> 23:26.526
I've changed.

23:26.687 --> 23:29.247
You're bound to resent my presence
in the camp.

23:29.327 --> 23:32.285
Well, see, I haven't changed...

23:32.367 --> 23:36.326
or changed the rules which,
against your having gone soft-headed...

23:36.407 --> 23:40.195
are fucking inviolate against you
running a game in my territory...

23:40.287 --> 23:43.438
without prior arrangement,
and on my fucking terms...

23:43.527 --> 23:45.119
set and agreed in advance.

23:45.327 --> 23:47.682
I'm not running a game, Cy.

23:48.567 --> 23:53.197
I fucking schooled you, Andy Cramed,
to the variety that can be played.

23:53.287 --> 23:55.926
I don't practise deception anymore.

23:56.007 --> 23:58.601
The opening pronouncement
of a dozen we both can name.

23:58.687 --> 24:01.565
I was nursed last fall
in the plague tent...

24:01.647 --> 24:05.799
and saved to be born anew
and preach the risen Lord.

24:06.647 --> 24:09.639
The Lord risen, or the wheel,
or the shell and pea...

24:09.727 --> 24:12.764
in this camp, for you, it's by my leave.

24:12.847 --> 24:16.886
- I will suffer any indignity-
- Which I still have not heard you solicit.

24:16.967 --> 24:20.437
Interference with God's work,
I will not suffer.

24:21.687 --> 24:24.042
Then you'd best be moving along, Andy.

24:24.847 --> 24:28.442
'Cause absent tribute,
even as His employee...

24:29.127 --> 24:31.197
you don't get to fucking operate.

24:32.527 --> 24:35.405
Don't let me find you trying, Andy.

24:36.487 --> 24:40.241
Or it's into the woods once more,
only this time...

24:40.607 --> 24:42.723
left nailed to a tree.

24:50.767 --> 24:54.646
I don't know what you'll understand
of my speech, and I don't give a fuck...

24:54.727 --> 24:58.242
or what terrorizing them human bonfires
this morning intend towards...

24:58.327 --> 25:00.158
the Chinks still under your thumb.

25:00.247 --> 25:04.763
A white man's son is dead,
that you will be doing business with.

25:05.007 --> 25:06.804
On the day of his son's burial...

25:06.887 --> 25:10.163
the smell of burning flesh
ought not offend his nose.

25:10.407 --> 25:13.558
The only showing you need make
that you've understood our chat...

25:13.647 --> 25:15.956
is a stop to them fucking fires.

25:16.047 --> 25:19.244
And you might want to put off
other violence while you're at it...

25:19.327 --> 25:23.878
as a decency to the day,
you heathen fucking cocksucker.

25:23.967 --> 25:25.685
Jesus fucking Christ!

25:25.767 --> 25:29.965
There will be no violence between you
and Wu, while the grieving goes on.

25:30.167 --> 25:33.603
My God, act civilised even if you ain't.

25:33.727 --> 25:36.036
I am a civilised person.

25:37.447 --> 25:41.884
Then take your civilisation
and get the fuck out of here!

25:53.607 --> 25:55.404
He got the fucking message.

25:57.767 --> 26:00.327
- Wait on Wu if you want.
- Wait until what?

26:00.407 --> 26:03.126
You wanna go to the fucking service
or fucking not?

26:03.207 --> 26:04.959
Don't have to ask us twice.

26:09.687 --> 26:11.837
What the fuck I wanna go for?

26:21.967 --> 26:24.765
What price will you take for your hotel,
Mr Farnum?

26:24.847 --> 26:27.725
- Why do you ask?
- Because I wanna buy it.

26:27.807 --> 26:28.956
Do you, sir?

26:29.527 --> 26:33.725
- I presume as agent for other parties?
- Presume away.

26:35.807 --> 26:37.718
Is it warm in here?

26:38.007 --> 26:40.396
- To me it seems chilly.
- Chilly, is it?

26:40.487 --> 26:43.718
Richardson, Mr Wolcott finds it chilly!

26:45.167 --> 26:47.920
Not around. I'll see to it, sir.

26:48.007 --> 26:51.841
If you are chilly in 10 minutes time,
pray for my immortal soul...

26:51.927 --> 26:55.078
because some fatal mishap
will have befallen me.

26:56.367 --> 27:01.316
Short of which, I will not fail
to dispel the chill now afflicting you.

27:06.407 --> 27:09.843
Cocksuckers.
Think they can take away everything!

27:10.127 --> 27:12.004
Oh, cocksucker.

27:18.047 --> 27:21.005
Found it outside dead,
under the window.

27:21.807 --> 27:25.243
- Well, why'd you bring it inside?
- Poor little finch.

27:26.167 --> 27:28.237
Throw it out and wipe your hands.

27:30.647 --> 27:34.845
If a bird taps on a window
or crashes into one...

27:35.687 --> 27:38.281
that means that there has been a death!

27:38.407 --> 27:39.965
We know there's been a death.

27:40.047 --> 27:42.641
We know now, but that bird
crashed into the window...

27:42.727 --> 27:45.605
and died a while ago, before we knew...

27:47.247 --> 27:48.566
for all we know.

27:49.647 --> 27:52.161
I've shined me and Al's,
but I ain't doing yours.

27:52.247 --> 27:54.363
Oh, well, I got me some new boots.

27:54.447 --> 27:58.156
They pinch bad,
but they got that factory shine still.

27:58.567 --> 28:02.719
Johnny, you can't wear
nothing new to a funeral...

28:02.807 --> 28:04.718
especially not new footwear.

28:05.607 --> 28:07.086
I ain't never heard that.

28:07.167 --> 28:08.839
Maybe because when
they was telling it to you...

28:08.927 --> 28:13.000
you was too busy listening to that
bullshit about birds flying into windows!

28:14.047 --> 28:17.676
To be kept till after
the after-funeral fuck rush is over.

28:17.767 --> 28:20.361
Fucking confiscated paraphernalia.

28:20.567 --> 28:21.920
Boots on a bar?

28:22.327 --> 28:24.716
What is the fucking matter
with you, Dan?

28:25.087 --> 28:27.157
Give me a fucking whiskey bottle.

28:33.287 --> 28:35.084
I'm sprinkling it...

28:35.847 --> 28:37.803
at the fucking doorways.

28:39.807 --> 28:44.358
Or would you rather
evil traipse past this fucking threshold?

28:44.527 --> 28:46.995
Must have brought that
from the other side.

28:52.607 --> 28:55.405
I've wished, sometimes,
only to play checkers...

28:55.807 --> 28:57.638
or to occupy myself some other way...

28:57.727 --> 29:00.560
than having to see
and feel so much sadness.

29:02.647 --> 29:07.562
Or feel, every moment,
how difficult things are to understand...

29:08.927 --> 29:10.326
or to live with.

29:11.967 --> 29:14.640
I've sometimes felt
I couldn't live with them...

29:15.767 --> 29:19.840
but I find I can, Sofia. I've found I am.

29:21.407 --> 29:25.195
Even when I think I'm not, or that I can't.

29:31.767 --> 29:33.962
Can you look to me now, Sofia?

29:35.407 --> 29:36.726
Can you try?

29:40.007 --> 29:44.523
I will be so grateful
if you will trust me with your sadness...

29:45.247 --> 29:49.160
and I will trust you with mine,
so that even when we are sad...

29:49.967 --> 29:53.039
we will be grateful for
how much we love each other...

29:54.567 --> 29:57.035
and know that we are...

29:57.127 --> 29:59.641
in the world as much in our pain...

30:01.327 --> 30:03.045
as in our happiness.

30:07.247 --> 30:08.965
Thank you, honey.

30:12.927 --> 30:17.239
Shall we dress now,
and say goodbye to William Bullock?

30:18.447 --> 30:20.517
...that no one that's turned in a needle...

30:20.607 --> 30:23.883
try eating the dope
or shoving it up theirselves...

30:23.967 --> 30:27.960
as I will be checking eyes
for signs before we fucking leave.

30:31.367 --> 30:33.756
And no being drunk, either, Jenn.

30:35.567 --> 30:39.003
And wash your fucking mouth.
You got seven kinds of cock breath.

30:48.847 --> 30:50.166
Yeah.

30:51.447 --> 30:54.166
Underarms clean, cunts braided?

30:54.567 --> 30:58.082
- They're ready.
- You are accountable.

30:59.407 --> 31:02.604
Why not come?
Make them accountable to you?

31:02.807 --> 31:04.923
Shut the fucking door behind you.

31:42.967 --> 31:44.320
William Bullock...

31:45.927 --> 31:48.760
beloved son of Martha and Seth...

31:49.647 --> 31:52.445
called to God age 11 years...

31:52.647 --> 31:55.445
as we are called by his passing.

31:55.767 --> 31:57.325
Let us bow our heads.

31:58.287 --> 32:00.881
From Psalm number 23.

32:01.287 --> 32:05.883
"The Lord is my shepherd,
I shall not want.

32:06.527 --> 32:10.156
"He maketh me lie down
in green pastures...

32:10.247 --> 32:13.557
"He leadeth me beside the still waters.

32:13.887 --> 32:16.526
"He restoreth my soul...

32:16.967 --> 32:21.563
"He leadeth me in the paths of
righteousness for His name's sake. "

32:32.407 --> 32:35.843
"Oh that my words were now written.

32:36.287 --> 32:39.757
"That they were graven
with an iron pen and lead...

32:39.967 --> 32:41.878
"in the rock for ever.

32:42.807 --> 32:45.480
"For I know that my Redeemer liveth...

32:45.567 --> 32:49.845
"and He shall stand
at the latter day upon the earth.

32:49.967 --> 32:54.882
"And though after my skin
worms destroy this body...

32:55.407 --> 32:59.605
"yet in my flesh I shall see God.

33:00.127 --> 33:02.960
"Whom I shall see for myself...

33:03.047 --> 33:07.518
"and my eyes shall behold...

33:18.527 --> 33:20.085
"and not another. "

33:49.807 --> 33:52.162
From Psalm 121.

33:54.247 --> 33:57.922
"I will lift up mine eyes unto the hills...

33:58.247 --> 34:00.681
"from whence cometh my help.

34:02.567 --> 34:06.845
"My help cometh from the Lord,
which made heaven and earth.

34:12.087 --> 34:14.554
"The Lord is thy keeper...

34:14.726 --> 34:18.925
"the Lord is thy shade
upon thy right hand.

34:19.047 --> 34:22.005
"The sun shall not smite thee by day...

34:22.087 --> 34:24.521
"nor the moon by night.

34:24.887 --> 34:28.482
"The Lord shall preserve thee
from all evil...

34:28.726 --> 34:30.763
"He shall preserve thy soul. "

34:30.847 --> 34:33.156
Let the people come
and say goodbye to William.

34:33.246 --> 34:36.956
"... preserve thy going out
and thy coming in from this time forth...

34:37.047 --> 34:39.277
"and even for evermore. "

34:42.047 --> 34:45.402
At the request of the family,
the burial is private.

34:45.487 --> 34:48.524
On their behalf, at their request,
I thank you all for coming.

34:48.607 --> 34:50.085
Let them see him.

34:56.087 --> 34:58.555
Those who wish to pay final respects...

34:58.647 --> 35:03.323
to the corpse of William Bullock
are invited now into the Bullock home.

36:34.167 --> 36:37.603
The girls are gonna be awhile.
They're viewing the corpse.

36:38.047 --> 36:41.403
- Get Wu now, please.
- At the icehouse.

36:41.527 --> 36:43.438
How should we set up the shifts?

36:43.527 --> 36:46.041
- What does he mean?
- You know, guarding Wu.

36:47.807 --> 36:48.876
Bring Wu here.

36:48.967 --> 36:51.356
Put him in one of the whores' rooms.

36:53.767 --> 36:55.439
Didn't make sense when he said it.

36:55.527 --> 36:58.121
That's the first place
Wu's people would look.

36:58.287 --> 37:01.006
"Put him on ice. "
It's a figure of speech, Johnny.

37:01.087 --> 37:02.998
Like, "Got you by the balls. "

37:05.047 --> 37:06.844
Up you go, little lady.

37:11.767 --> 37:14.759
We picked flowers
in William's graveyard.

37:16.247 --> 37:17.885
Me and Trixie.

37:18.527 --> 37:21.917
"Trixie and I" is how
that's supposed to go, I think.

37:23.607 --> 37:24.960
Yes, Ellsworth.

37:28.727 --> 37:31.525
Yes, to the question you've asked me.

38:03.847 --> 38:06.202
- Swearengen.
- Swearengen!

38:09.207 --> 38:12.404
Now, Wu. Swearengen.

38:15.167 --> 38:16.680
Swearengen!

38:18.607 --> 38:21.917
Mr Wu, why don't you just come with us
like a gentleman?

38:50.247 --> 38:54.479
Seems to me, Wolcott,
last your eyes had that unsettled look...

38:54.607 --> 38:57.246
matters got grave for some young girls.

38:58.487 --> 39:01.638
What does it? Do you know?

39:02.407 --> 39:04.079
Or does the water
just come on you quick?

39:04.167 --> 39:07.955
- "Be ye afraid of the sword!"
- Jesus fucking Christ!

39:08.047 --> 39:09.924
"For wrath bringeth
the punishments of the sword. "

39:10.007 --> 39:11.884
Get him the fuck out of here!

39:17.847 --> 39:21.157
You're a desperate man,
aren't you, Tolliver? Desperate.

39:21.247 --> 39:22.965
You feel your position weakening.

39:23.047 --> 39:26.596
And what I do, situation like that,
instead of murdering helpless women...

39:26.687 --> 39:29.838
- I get on my hind legs and fight.
- Mr Wolcott.

39:32.287 --> 39:35.438
I have nourished a suspicion
that we might pass each other...

39:35.527 --> 39:36.721
in the telegraph office.

39:36.807 --> 39:39.002
I, of course, would be communicating
with Yankton.

39:39.087 --> 39:42.284
I wonder, would your messages
be sent to Helena?

39:42.367 --> 39:45.916
Mr Hearst is not a partisan
in territorial rivalries, Commissioner.

39:46.007 --> 39:48.475
Oh, God, I want to believe that.

39:49.447 --> 39:52.245
The great man himself
will allay your doubts.

39:54.207 --> 39:56.038
He joins us within the week.

39:57.607 --> 39:58.960
Does he, for a fact?

39:59.047 --> 40:02.881
I would hope, sir, that by that time,
Yankton's answer to my telegram...

40:02.967 --> 40:06.243
would authorise me to offer,
and I would've heard accepted terms...

40:06.327 --> 40:10.605
of annexation of this camp,
such that a huge banner...

40:10.687 --> 40:12.803
would be hung across
the thoroughfare...

40:12.887 --> 40:17.642
"Welcome, George Hearst,
to Deadwood of Dakota territory. "

40:17.807 --> 40:20.002
I don't envy you the interval,
Commissioner.

40:20.087 --> 40:22.681
Ain't it the idle hours that try us?

40:22.767 --> 40:26.601
Ain't they what lead us sometimes
to the cliff, sometimes fucking over?

40:26.687 --> 40:30.396
I may have to ask Mr Hearst
if that's his experience, too...

40:31.047 --> 40:33.880
or, of any of those that he may know.

41:08.807 --> 41:10.718
Let me ask you something.

41:12.527 --> 41:16.122
You think you're giving me a treat,
drooling on my fucking nuts?

41:16.207 --> 41:19.517
- Because I happen not to enjoy it.
- Sorry.

41:19.607 --> 41:22.280
It's a strange fucking sensation.

41:22.527 --> 41:25.280
Distracts me from my hard-on.

41:29.127 --> 41:30.958
Fucking caskets.

41:31.447 --> 41:34.405
Bring out the dunce
in the entire fucking community.

41:35.327 --> 41:38.876
I took some fucking beating
after my brother's fucking funeral.

41:40.087 --> 41:42.726
Smacks coming
from every fucking angle.

41:42.927 --> 41:46.203
Still dizzy from the smack from the left,
here comes a smack from the right.

41:46.287 --> 41:48.801
Brain can't bounce around fast enough.

41:49.207 --> 41:52.563
Headache I fucking had
for three fucking weeks.

41:55.207 --> 41:57.960
Fuck fault is it of mine
if my fucking brother croaks?

41:58.047 --> 41:59.878
Ain't even my fucking brother.

41:59.967 --> 42:03.596
Fucking people take me in,
I didn't ask them to fucking take me in.

42:06.007 --> 42:10.842
Fucking flopping like a fish on the dock,
my brother, the perch.

42:12.807 --> 42:14.559
Fucking falling sickness.

42:15.487 --> 42:18.763
Let the old man beat you
because he's sad...

42:19.287 --> 42:21.005
he has his load on.

42:21.287 --> 42:24.677
I did better in the orphanage,
if that fat-ass Mrs Anderson...

42:24.767 --> 42:26.837
hadn't turned out a fucking pimp.

42:29.287 --> 42:32.677
Anyways, how was the funeral?

42:33.367 --> 42:36.996
- Did you carry on, disgrace yourself?
- No.

42:37.127 --> 42:41.484
- Everyone was sad, I expect.
- But it was pretty, too.

42:41.967 --> 42:43.036
Shut up.

42:49.127 --> 42:50.640
Do you dye your hair?

43:22.487 --> 43:24.318
Whatever will let us live...

43:43.487 --> 43:45.079
as we are now.

43:46.305 --> 43:52.827
