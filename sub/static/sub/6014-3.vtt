00:02.480 --> 00:04.436
I hate clothes, okay?

00:04.600 --> 00:05.919
I hate buying them.

00:06.080 --> 00:08.036
I hate picking them out of my closet.

00:08.200 --> 00:12.637
I can't stand every day trying to come
up with little outfits for myself.

00:12.800 --> 00:13.949
I think eventually...

00:15.480 --> 00:16.629
...fashion won't even exist.

00:16.800 --> 00:18.472
We'll all be wearing the same thing.

00:18.640 --> 00:21.279
Because any time I see a movie
or a TV show...

00:21.440 --> 00:23.829
...where there's people
from the future...

00:24.000 --> 00:25.752
...they're all wearing the same thing.

00:25.920 --> 00:29.230
Somehow they decided,
"This is going to be our outfit."

00:29.400 --> 00:33.916
One-piece silver jumpsuit,
V-stripe and boots. That's it.

00:35.640 --> 00:38.234
We should come up with an outfit
for Earth. An Earth outfit.

00:38.400 --> 00:39.549
We should vote on it.

00:39.720 --> 00:42.951
Candidates propose
different outfits. No speeches.

00:43.120 --> 00:46.032
They walk out, twirl, walk off.

00:46.200 --> 00:50.398
We just sit in the audience and go,
"That was nice. I could wear that."

00:54.920 --> 00:58.993
- I think I've seen enough.
- I might have something in the back.

00:59.560 --> 01:02.120
The back? They never find
anything in the back.

01:02.280 --> 01:04.589
If they had anything good,
they'd put it in the front.

01:04.760 --> 01:09.072
Why don't they open an entire store
for the back? Call it "Just Back."

01:09.400 --> 01:11.152
All back. No front.

01:11.320 --> 01:14.118
You walk in the front,
you're immediately in the back.

01:15.080 --> 01:17.913
Look, Elaine. Tie carwash.

01:20.720 --> 01:24.269
- I just read that. That's terrific.
- Her father wrote that.

01:24.440 --> 01:26.670
- Alton Benes is your father?
- Yeah.

01:26.840 --> 01:28.592
I always felt he deserved
a wider audience.

01:28.760 --> 01:30.352
I'm not so sure he wants one.

01:32.640 --> 01:34.119
Hey, don't forget Sunday, okay?

01:34.280 --> 01:37.158
You and George are coming, right?
Hotel Westbury, 8:00.

01:37.320 --> 01:39.436
Yeah, I guess I'm coming. I mean...

01:39.720 --> 01:42.837
- What, you don't wanna go now?
- No, I'll go. I'm going.

01:43.000 --> 01:44.718
No, Jerry, you have to.
I need a buffer.

01:44.880 --> 01:47.314
I haven't seen my father
in a while, and, you know, it's...

01:47.480 --> 01:51.792
I'm worried I won't be able talk to him.
He's such a great writer.

01:51.960 --> 01:54.838
Frankly, I prefer
the company of nitwits.

01:56.560 --> 02:00.075
So that's why
we're not together anymore.

02:04.200 --> 02:06.839
What is this?

02:07.000 --> 02:08.672
This is beautiful.

02:08.840 --> 02:10.512
These jackets never fit me right.

02:10.720 --> 02:12.119
Try it on.

02:17.720 --> 02:18.869
Wow.

02:19.040 --> 02:20.439
This is soft suede.

02:20.600 --> 02:25.071
This may be the most perfect jacket
I have ever put on.

02:25.240 --> 02:29.074
- How much is it?
- Oh, my God.

02:29.240 --> 02:30.639
Bad?

02:30.800 --> 02:32.870
- Very bad?
- You have no idea.

02:33.040 --> 02:34.678
- I have some idea.
- No idea.

02:34.840 --> 02:36.910
- I've got a ballpark.
- There's no park...

02:37.080 --> 02:38.593
...and the team has relocated.

02:38.760 --> 02:40.910
Let me see that.

02:41.560 --> 02:43.198
That is high.

02:45.640 --> 02:48.108
Oh, man, that is
a beautiful jacket, though.

02:48.880 --> 02:51.155
What's with the pink lining
with the candy stripes?

02:51.440 --> 02:53.556
It's just lining.
You can always have it changed.

02:53.720 --> 02:55.392
Should I get it?

02:55.760 --> 02:58.558
I hate these moments. I'm hearing
the dual voices now, you know?

02:58.720 --> 03:02.633
"What about the money?"
"What's money?"

03:02.800 --> 03:04.916
It looks wonderful on you.

03:06.000 --> 03:12.074

03:23.560 --> 03:24.754
- Hey.
- Hey.

03:25.280 --> 03:26.508
New jacket.

03:26.680 --> 03:28.398
- What do you think?
- It's beautiful.

03:28.560 --> 03:30.278
- Is it me?
- That's definitely you.

03:30.440 --> 03:31.793
- Really?
- That's more you...

03:31.960 --> 03:33.712
...than you've ever been.

03:35.960 --> 03:40.431
- What is with the pink lining?
- I don't know. It's got a pink lining.

03:41.520 --> 03:45.399
- So, what'd you pay for this?
- I paid what it costs.

03:47.560 --> 03:48.993
- How much?
- What's the difference?

03:49.160 --> 03:51.515
- You're not gonna tell me?
- I'd rather not say out loud.

03:51.680 --> 03:52.908
It's embarrassing.

03:53.400 --> 03:55.630
- Over 300?
- Yes. But let's just stop it right there.

03:55.800 --> 03:58.030
- It's over 400.
- I'm really not answering anymore.

03:58.200 --> 03:59.792
- Is it over 400?
- Would you...?

04:04.640 --> 04:06.596
Whoa, Nelson.

04:08.120 --> 04:10.509
I know. I know.

04:13.520 --> 04:16.079
What are you gonna do
with the leather one?

04:16.680 --> 04:18.033
I don't know.

04:22.520 --> 04:24.556
Are you gonna wear it?

04:27.240 --> 04:29.879
- I don't know, maybe.
- Well, you're not gonna wear this.

04:30.360 --> 04:32.430
Do you want it?

04:33.960 --> 04:37.270
Yeah, okay, I'll take it.

04:40.560 --> 04:42.551
I like that jacket.

04:46.520 --> 04:50.274
- Okay, take it.
- Hey. Good karma for you.

04:53.680 --> 04:55.750
Oh, baby.

05:10.000 --> 05:11.149
What is that song?

05:13.520 --> 05:15.795
It's from Les MisÃ©rables.
I went to see it last week.

05:15.960 --> 05:19.475
I can't get it out of my head.
I just keep singing it over and over.

05:19.640 --> 05:21.870
It just comes out.
I have no control over it.

05:22.040 --> 05:24.952
I'm singing it on elevators, buses.
Singing in front of clients.

05:25.120 --> 05:27.156
It's taking over my life.

05:28.280 --> 05:31.158
You know, Schumann
went mad from that.

05:31.640 --> 05:33.949
Artie Schumann
from Camp Hatchapee?

05:34.400 --> 05:36.550
- No, you idiot.
- What are you, Bud Abbott?

05:36.720 --> 05:38.711
What are you calling me an idiot for?

05:40.480 --> 05:42.914
You don't know Robert Schumann,
the composer?

05:44.040 --> 05:46.349
Oh, Schumann. Of course.

05:46.560 --> 05:49.518
He went crazy from one note.
Couldn't get it out of his head.

05:49.680 --> 05:53.229
I think it was an A. He kept
repeating it over and over again.

05:53.400 --> 05:55.311
He had to be institutionalised.

05:55.480 --> 05:56.913
Really?

05:57.480 --> 05:59.391
Well, what if it doesn't stop?

05:59.720 --> 06:03.349
Oh, that I really needed to hear.
That helps a lot.

06:03.520 --> 06:07.798
All right, just say something.
Just start talking. Change the subject.

06:07.960 --> 06:09.871
Let's just go, all right?

06:10.200 --> 06:12.475
I can't believe we're having dinner
with Alton Benes.

06:12.640 --> 06:14.153
I know exactly what's gonna happen.

06:14.320 --> 06:16.356
I'm gonna try and act
like I'm not impressed.

06:16.520 --> 06:18.715
- He'll see right through it.
- He'll look at us...

06:18.880 --> 06:21.075
...like he's backstage
at a puppet show.

06:21.240 --> 06:23.276
Let me just get my jacket.

06:37.080 --> 06:39.071
This is huge.

06:39.240 --> 06:42.277
- When did this happen?
- Wednesday.

06:43.160 --> 06:46.357
This jacket has completely
changed my life.

06:46.520 --> 06:49.398
When I leave the house in this...

06:49.640 --> 06:51.517
...it's with a whole different confidence.

06:51.680 --> 06:54.831
Like, tonight I might've been
a little nervous, but inside this jacket...

06:55.000 --> 06:59.312
...I am composed, grounded, secure
that I can meet any social challenge.

07:00.080 --> 07:01.479
Can I say one thing to you?

07:01.640 --> 07:04.996
And I say this with an unblemished
record of staunch heterosexuality.

07:05.160 --> 07:06.752
Absolutely.

07:07.880 --> 07:09.598
It's fabulous.

07:11.240 --> 07:13.834
- I know.
- And I'll tell you something else...

07:14.000 --> 07:15.797
...l'm not even gonna ask you.

07:15.960 --> 07:17.552
I wanna know,
but I'm not gonna ask.

07:17.720 --> 07:20.280
You'll tell me
when you feel comfortable.

07:22.840 --> 07:24.432
So, what was it, 400?

07:26.360 --> 07:28.749
Five hundred?
Did you pay 500 for this?

07:28.920 --> 07:34.040
Over 6? Can't be 7. Don't tell me
you paid $700 for this jacket.

07:34.200 --> 07:37.078
Did you pay $700 for this jacket?
Is that what you're saying to me?

07:37.240 --> 07:40.755
You are sick! Is that what
you paid for this jacket?

07:40.920 --> 07:42.273
Over 700?!

07:42.880 --> 07:45.269
What did you pay for this jacket?
I won't say anything.

07:45.440 --> 07:48.352
I wanna know what you paid
for this jacket.

07:48.520 --> 07:52.911
Oh, my God! A thousand dollars?!
You paid $1000 for this jacket.

07:53.080 --> 07:55.036
All right. I'm walking out
of here right now...

07:55.200 --> 07:57.191
...thinking you paid $1000
for this jacket...

07:57.360 --> 07:59.191
...unless you tell me different.

08:03.240 --> 08:04.912
All right, I'll tell you what.

08:05.080 --> 08:08.993
If you don't say anything in five
seconds, I'll know it was over 1000.

08:10.040 --> 08:11.632
Hey. Hey, will you do me a solid?

08:11.800 --> 08:14.268
- What kind of solid?
- Sit in the car for two minutes...

08:14.440 --> 08:16.908
...while it's double-parked.
I gotta pick up some birds.

08:17.080 --> 08:18.957
- Birds?
- A friend of mine, he's a magician.

08:19.120 --> 08:21.714
He's away on vacation. He asked me
to take care of his doves.

08:21.880 --> 08:24.917
- So take a cab.
- They won't take a cage full of birds.

08:25.560 --> 08:28.120
I can't. I'm on my way out.
There's no way I can do it.

08:29.360 --> 08:33.751
- George, do me a solid. Two minutes.
- Well, I'm going with him.

08:33.919 --> 08:37.037
I'd like to. I've never done
a solid before.

08:37.880 --> 08:40.952
All right. I'll... Yeah. All right.
Have a good one.

08:43.520 --> 08:46.318
Two minutes. Believe me,
I know his two minutes.

08:46.480 --> 08:50.758
By his conception of time,
his life will last over 2000 years.

09:00.720 --> 09:02.438
Schumann.

09:04.760 --> 09:06.432
Where are they?

09:06.600 --> 09:08.431
Maybe he didn't show up.

09:08.600 --> 09:10.716
What, you don't wanna do this?

09:10.880 --> 09:12.871
There's never been
an appointment in my life...

09:13.040 --> 09:14.917
...where I wanted the other guy
to show up.

09:22.440 --> 09:23.793
Wait a second. Is that him?

09:26.200 --> 09:28.031
Yeah. I think it is.

09:29.000 --> 09:30.513
Where's Elaine?

09:31.360 --> 09:33.191
I'm nervous.

09:34.520 --> 09:36.476
- Excuse me, Mr. Benes.
- Yeah.

09:36.640 --> 09:39.029
I'm Jerry, Elaine's friend.
This is George.

09:39.200 --> 09:40.918
It's a great thrill to meet you, sir.

09:46.000 --> 09:47.558
Sit down.

09:53.360 --> 09:55.430
- Want a drink?
- Sure.

09:56.120 --> 09:59.078
- What'll you have?
- Cranberry juice with two limes.

09:59.240 --> 10:01.549
And I'll have a club soda with no ice.

10:03.840 --> 10:06.513
I'll have another scotch
with plenty of ice.

10:07.400 --> 10:08.719
You like ice.

10:10.360 --> 10:13.397
- I say, do you like ice?
- Like it?

10:13.720 --> 10:16.518
Don't you find that you get more
without it?

10:19.960 --> 10:21.552
- Where's Elaine?
- Well, we thought...

10:21.720 --> 10:23.312
...she was meeting you earlier.

10:23.480 --> 10:25.710
She's usually pretty punctual.

10:28.440 --> 10:30.158
Don't you find that, George?

10:30.320 --> 10:34.154
Yeah. Yeah, she's punctual, and...

10:34.320 --> 10:36.880
...she's been late sometimes.

10:37.040 --> 10:40.077
Yeah, yeah.
Sometimes she's on time...

10:40.240 --> 10:41.798
...and sometimes she's late.

10:42.560 --> 10:44.198
I guess...

10:45.240 --> 10:46.992
...today she's late.

10:49.520 --> 10:51.158
It appears that way.

10:53.080 --> 10:54.638
- Yep.
- Yep.

10:56.920 --> 11:00.037
- Looks like rain.
- I know. I know. That's what they said.

11:00.200 --> 11:03.476
- Who said?
- The weather guy, Dr. Waldo.

11:04.440 --> 11:07.000
I don't need anybody to tell me
it's gonna rain.

11:07.360 --> 11:09.555
Oh, no. Of course not. L...

11:09.720 --> 11:12.473
All I have to do is stick my head
out the window.

11:18.480 --> 11:20.516
Which one's supposed to be
the funny guy?

11:20.680 --> 11:23.638
- Oh, he's the comedian.
- I'm just a regular person.

11:23.800 --> 11:26.519
No, no. He's just being modest.

11:26.880 --> 11:29.474
We had a funny guy
with us in Korea.

11:29.640 --> 11:31.278
A tail gunner.

11:31.640 --> 11:34.438
They blew his brains out
all over the Pacific.

11:37.720 --> 11:39.790
There's nothing funny about that.

11:53.080 --> 11:55.594
Would you excuse me?
I'm gonna go to the bathroom.

11:55.760 --> 11:57.239
I'll be right back.

12:12.720 --> 12:16.918
I just wanted to tell you
that I really enjoyed Fair Game.

12:17.080 --> 12:18.752
I thought it was just brilliant.

12:19.160 --> 12:20.718
Drivel.

12:21.360 --> 12:23.954
Yeah, maybe some parts.

12:24.120 --> 12:25.633
What parts?

12:27.240 --> 12:28.832
The...

12:29.400 --> 12:31.152
...drivel parts.

12:33.360 --> 12:36.636
Oh, my gosh. I just realized
I have to make a phone call.

12:36.800 --> 12:41.715
I can't believe... Would you...?
I'll be right back.

12:44.640 --> 12:47.393
Thank you for leaving me alone
with him.

12:47.560 --> 12:50.028
That was brutal.
I can't go back out there.

12:50.200 --> 12:52.714
- Well, let's just leave.
- Elaine will kill me.

12:52.880 --> 12:55.235
- Where is she?
- She's gotta be here soon.

12:55.400 --> 12:57.550
How could she leave us alone
with this lunatic?

12:57.960 --> 13:00.599
Ten more minutes, and that's it,
I'm leaving.

13:00.760 --> 13:02.671
I have to tell you,
this guy scares me.

13:02.880 --> 13:04.677
The waiter was trembling.

13:04.840 --> 13:07.149
We can't possibly have dinner
with him alone.

13:07.320 --> 13:09.709
- How we gonna get out of it?
- We say we're frightened...

13:09.880 --> 13:11.677
...and we have to go home.

13:13.560 --> 13:16.996
Yeah, that's good. He'd clunk
our heads together like Moe.

13:18.440 --> 13:21.273
I don't know. Just start scratching.

13:21.440 --> 13:24.159
Tell him you have the crabs.
He was in the military.

13:24.320 --> 13:26.117
He'll understand that.

13:28.080 --> 13:30.514
All fathers are intimidating.

13:30.680 --> 13:33.240
They're intimidating
because they are fathers.

13:33.400 --> 13:37.712
Once a man has children,
for the rest of his life his attitude is:

13:37.880 --> 13:41.190
"The hell with the world,
I can make my own people.

13:43.160 --> 13:45.549
I'll eat whatever I want.
I'll wear whatever I want...

13:45.720 --> 13:49.349
...and I'll create whoever I want."

13:57.080 --> 13:58.832
Who'd you call?

13:59.680 --> 14:05.232
My uncle is having an operation.
I just wanted to see how he was.

14:06.200 --> 14:08.156
What kind of an operation?

14:09.480 --> 14:11.072
Bone marrow.

14:12.160 --> 14:13.593
- Mr. Benes?
- Yeah.

14:13.760 --> 14:15.512
Message for you.

14:16.960 --> 14:18.678
From Elaine.

14:18.840 --> 14:20.398
She got tied up.

14:20.560 --> 14:22.835
She'll be here in 30 minutes.

14:33.400 --> 14:37.188
Yeah, they should have taken care
of Castro when they had the chance.

14:37.360 --> 14:40.432
Like we did in Guatemala in '53.

14:41.120 --> 14:43.793
- Well, Guatemala...
- Sure. Guatemala.

14:44.160 --> 14:46.993
All right. You boys
get yourselves together.

14:47.160 --> 14:51.438
We'll head up to the restaurant.
I'll leave a note for Elaine.

14:52.280 --> 14:54.510
I'm going to the bathroom.

14:57.600 --> 14:58.953
- Let's go.
- What about Elaine?

14:59.120 --> 15:00.872
- Hell with Elaine.
- She'll be furious.

15:01.040 --> 15:02.758
We're dying here!

15:03.120 --> 15:04.838
That's her. She's here.

15:05.520 --> 15:07.397
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
Where is Dad?

15:07.560 --> 15:09.710
He's in the bathroom.

15:13.240 --> 15:14.912
Where have you been?

15:15.120 --> 15:17.395
Kramer. That Kramer.

15:17.560 --> 15:19.551
I'm just about to leave,
he calls me up.

15:19.720 --> 15:21.870
He begs me to sit in his car
for two minutes...

15:22.200 --> 15:23.997
...so he can pick up these birds.

15:24.160 --> 15:25.354
Oh, you didn't.

15:25.520 --> 15:27.750
Well, he said he'd drive me here
right after.

15:27.920 --> 15:30.753
So I am sitting in his car
for 20 minutes!

15:30.920 --> 15:33.480
He doesn't come down.
I am freezing.

15:33.640 --> 15:36.598
Then a cop comes by.
Tells me to get out of the car.

15:36.760 --> 15:38.273
He's a city marshal.

15:38.440 --> 15:40.271
He's towing the car away.

15:40.440 --> 15:43.716
Kramer owes thousands of dollars
in back tickets.

15:44.240 --> 15:46.356
He was gonna tow it
with me in the car.

15:46.520 --> 15:49.273
So they tow the car.
Now I am standing outside...

15:49.440 --> 15:52.477
...and I am freezing, but I cannot leave
because I gotta tell him...

15:52.640 --> 15:53.834
...what happened to the car.

15:54.000 --> 15:58.073
So finally, finally, he comes down
with this giant cage filled with doves.

15:58.240 --> 16:01.550
He said he was getting instructions,
that each dove has a different diet.

16:01.720 --> 16:04.075
So we're wandering around,
trying to get a cab...

16:04.240 --> 16:06.390
...when two of these doves fly out.

16:06.560 --> 16:08.232
Now we're running after these doves.

16:08.400 --> 16:10.436
I almost got hit by a bus.

16:15.440 --> 16:17.158
So how is everything going
over here?

16:17.880 --> 16:20.235
- Great.
- Couldn't be better.

16:21.720 --> 16:24.393
Good, because Dad can make
some people a little uncomfortable.

16:24.560 --> 16:27.154
- Oh, no.
- Get out of here.

16:27.880 --> 16:30.314
Man, Kramer. I could kill him.

16:30.480 --> 16:32.835
You know better than
to get involved with Kramer.

16:33.080 --> 16:36.072
- He said he'd give me a lift.
- The lift.

16:36.240 --> 16:40.028
Like the lure of the Siren's song.
Never what it seems to be.

16:40.200 --> 16:42.668
Yet who among us can resist?

16:43.000 --> 16:45.230
Where do you come up
with this stuff?

16:45.400 --> 16:47.595
- Well, look who's here.
- Oh, hi, Dad.

16:47.760 --> 16:48.909
Hello, dear.

16:49.160 --> 16:51.674
- Who's the lipstick for?
- No one.

16:51.840 --> 16:53.592
- How's your mother?
- Fine.

16:54.120 --> 16:56.031
How about you, are you working?

16:56.200 --> 16:58.668
Yeah. I'm reading manuscripts
for Pendant Publishing.

16:58.840 --> 17:00.273
I told you 10 times.

17:00.440 --> 17:03.000
Pendant? Those bastards.

17:03.480 --> 17:04.674
Well, all right, boys.

17:05.200 --> 17:07.953
We'll go to that Pakistani
restaurant on 46th Street.

17:08.359 --> 17:10.476
You're not afraid of a little spice,
are you?

17:18.560 --> 17:20.915
Pipe down, chorus boy.

17:21.960 --> 17:23.154
Chorus boy?

17:23.800 --> 17:25.631
It's snowing.

17:25.800 --> 17:27.074
It's beautiful.

17:27.599 --> 17:28.919
Snow?

17:30.080 --> 17:32.071
Snow, that can't be good for suede,
can it?

17:32.840 --> 17:34.353
I wouldn't think so.

17:34.520 --> 17:36.192
What should I do?

17:37.360 --> 17:39.316
We're taking a cab, aren't we?

17:39.480 --> 17:41.948
Cab? It's only five blocks.

17:43.360 --> 17:46.636
- Why don't you turn it inside out?
- Inside out. Great.

17:55.120 --> 17:56.678
Wait a minute.

17:57.240 --> 18:00.755
- What the hell do you call this?
- I turned my jacket inside out.

18:01.440 --> 18:02.998
Well, you look like a damn fool.

18:04.520 --> 18:07.159
Well, it's a new suede jacket.

18:07.320 --> 18:08.514
It might get ruined.

18:08.800 --> 18:12.270
Well, you're not walking with me
and my daughter dressed like that.

18:12.440 --> 18:14.510
That's for damn sure.

18:15.640 --> 18:18.677
It's... It's only a few blocks.

18:28.000 --> 18:29.228
- Elaine?
- Yeah.

18:29.400 --> 18:30.799
Come on up.

18:36.920 --> 18:38.148
- Hey.
- Hey.

18:38.320 --> 18:40.231
- I gotta feed the birds.
- So?

18:40.400 --> 18:42.630
You got any of those Mini Ritzes?

18:46.400 --> 18:48.391
I can't believe that I do.

18:51.240 --> 18:52.593
- What, are you going out?
- Yeah.

18:53.120 --> 18:55.111
Hey, where's your new jacket?

19:01.080 --> 19:05.631
- Oh, what'd you do to it?
- I was out in the snow last night.

19:06.520 --> 19:08.909
Don't you know
what that does to suede?

19:10.200 --> 19:11.474
I have an idea.

19:12.720 --> 19:14.631
We can make the 9:30
at Cinema Three.

19:14.800 --> 19:16.233
Okay.

19:16.400 --> 19:17.992
Hello.

19:18.680 --> 19:21.513
Thanks again for coming last night.
Dad said he had a great time.

19:21.680 --> 19:24.877
- Is he still in town?
- He's driving back to Maryland tonight.

19:25.040 --> 19:27.429
So, what are you gonna do
with that one now?

19:27.600 --> 19:30.398
- I don't know.
- Well...

19:30.720 --> 19:34.030
I didn't wanna tell you this,
but usually he hates everyone.

19:34.200 --> 19:35.633
Really?

19:37.080 --> 19:39.958
- You gonna throw this out?
- Well, I can't wear it.

19:40.120 --> 19:41.951
Yeah, he liked you, though.

19:42.120 --> 19:44.873
Said you reminded him
of somebody he knew in Korea.

19:46.920 --> 19:50.230
Well, if you're just gonna throw it out,
you know, I could take it.

19:50.400 --> 19:52.231
Yeah. Go ahead. Take it.

19:53.360 --> 19:55.715
Dad thinks George is gay.

19:57.400 --> 19:59.152
Oh, because of all the singing?

20:00.240 --> 20:02.674
No. He pretty much thinks
everyone is gay.

20:05.800 --> 20:07.074
See, I like it like this.

20:08.680 --> 20:10.272
Isn't that...?

20:15.080 --> 20:17.753
Is this from the snow last night?

20:19.000 --> 20:22.515
You know what you should have done?
You should have turned it inside out.

20:22.720 --> 20:24.995
I'll try and remember that.

20:26.240 --> 20:30.358
Boy, it's too bad
you gave me this one too.

20:31.600 --> 20:33.397
Yeah. Too bad.

20:35.080 --> 20:37.719
Gonna have to do something
about this lining.

20:51.080 --> 20:56.598
I had a leather jacket that got ruined.
Now, why does moisture ruin leather?

20:56.760 --> 20:58.113
I don't get this.

20:58.280 --> 21:01.875
Aren't cows outside
most of the time?

21:02.040 --> 21:05.077
I don't understand. When it's raining,
do cows go up to the farmhouse:

21:05.240 --> 21:07.834
"Let us in. We're all wearing leather!

21:08.280 --> 21:11.955
Open the door. We're gonna
ruin the whole outfit here."

21:12.120 --> 21:14.111
"Is it suede?"
"I am suede.

21:14.280 --> 21:18.512
The whole thing is suede. I can't
have this cleaned. It's all I got."

22:02.600 --> 22:04.591
