01:02.752 --> 01:05.846
(male narrator)
This briefing is
from file A56-7W,

01:05.922 --> 01:07.082
classified top-secret.

01:07.156 --> 01:08.589
Subject is.: Airwolf.

01:08.658 --> 01:10.387
A Mach 1-plus
attack helicopter

01:10.459 --> 01:12.893
with the most
advanced weapon system
in the air today.

01:12.962 --> 01:15.590
It's been hidden somewhere
in the western United States

01:15.665 --> 01:17.326
by its test pilot,
Stringfellow Hawke.

01:17.400 --> 01:19.027
Hawke has promised
to return Airwolf

01:19.101 --> 01:22.662
only if we can find
his brother St. John,
an MIA in Vietnam.

01:22.738 --> 01:24.467
We suspect Archangel,
Deputy Director

01:24.540 --> 01:26.201
of the agency
that built Airwolf

01:26.275 --> 01:27.640
is secretly helping Hawke

01:27.710 --> 01:29.371
in return for
Hawke's flying Airwolf

01:29.445 --> 01:31.072
on missions
of national concern.

01:31.147 --> 01:34.275
Stringfellow Hawke is 34,
a brilliant combat pilot

01:34.350 --> 01:36.614
and a recluse since his
brother's disappearance.

01:36.686 --> 01:38.483
His only friend
is Dominic Santini

01:38.554 --> 01:41.079
whose air service
is the cover
for their government work.

01:41.157 --> 01:42.988
With Hawke and Santini
flying as a team

01:43.059 --> 01:44.686
at speeds rivaling
the fastest jets,

01:44.760 --> 01:46.250
backed by unmatched firepower,

01:46.329 --> 01:49.025
Airwolf is too dangerous
to be left
in unenlightened hands.

01:49.098 --> 01:51.157
Finding it
is your first priority.

02:03.346 --> 02:04.973
(Hawke)
Dom, we got any signal yet?

02:05.047 --> 02:08.175
(Dominic)
They can't bend radar
around corners, String.

02:11.087 --> 02:13.988
Hang on. We'll climb up
where they can see us.

02:21.597 --> 02:23.827
There it is. Bearing 295,

02:23.933 --> 02:25.924
in that itty-bitty canyon,
I'll bet.

02:26.002 --> 02:27.367
Weapons to combat mode.

02:27.436 --> 02:28.698
Combat mode.

02:41.851 --> 02:43.079
Turbos.

02:43.152 --> 02:44.710
String, that canyon
ain't wide enough

02:44.787 --> 02:46.914
for a couple of burros
to walk side by side.

02:46.989 --> 02:49.617
We'll make it
if we get those burros
out of our way.

03:18.788 --> 03:20.551
(Dominic)
String, you hit
the bull's-eye.

03:20.623 --> 03:22.887
All right,
let's climb out of it.

03:25.027 --> 03:26.722
Dom, she's still awful mushy.

03:26.796 --> 03:28.559
Canyon walls coming up.

03:32.768 --> 03:34.565
This thing's lost
all of its delicacy.

03:34.637 --> 03:35.968
I got to muscle it.

03:36.038 --> 03:38.563
You can't!
We're gonna pile
into those walls!

03:38.641 --> 03:40.575
Can't help it.
We got to try.

03:58.728 --> 04:00.127
Oh, my God!

04:22.184 --> 04:24.118
Saint Peter, I presume.

04:24.620 --> 04:27.555
Sorry, just your
run-of-the-miII ArchangeI.

04:30.626 --> 04:31.786
[sighs]

04:34.230 --> 04:38.826
Oh, great jumping Jehoshaphat!

04:39.201 --> 04:41.032
WeII, what's your appraisaI,
Mr. Santini?

04:41.103 --> 04:42.263
Are you kiddin'?

04:42.338 --> 04:44.363
[Iaughing]
Man, that's amazing.

04:44.440 --> 04:46.305
I forgot it was a game.

04:46.842 --> 04:49.242
It's not a game,
it's a simuIation.

04:49.645 --> 04:51.943
But we're pIeased
you find it so reaIistic.

04:52.014 --> 04:55.575
Yeah, you just sit in there
and you--you swear
it's the reaI thing.

04:55.651 --> 04:57.278
(Hawke)
WeII, not quite.

04:57.653 --> 04:59.587
The stick's way too Ioose.

05:00.056 --> 05:01.489
And there's too much yaw.

05:01.557 --> 05:03.218
The reaI AirwoIf
wouId have made it.

05:03.292 --> 05:05.487
WeII, maybe next time,
when you're more
famiIiar with--

05:05.561 --> 05:07.654
There won't be a next time.

05:07.730 --> 05:10.563
I came and I fIew this
overgrown video machine

05:10.633 --> 05:11.827
Iike you asked.

05:12.168 --> 05:13.533
I toId you
what's wrong with it.

05:13.602 --> 05:14.933
Now I'm goin' home.

05:17.206 --> 05:20.664
(woman on PA system)
Simulation is now complete.
All banks show recycle mode.

05:20.743 --> 05:23.439
I'II be outside
when you're ready
to fIy us back to the cabin.

05:23.512 --> 05:25.446
Hawke, Fr. Winchester
has a report

05:25.514 --> 05:26.913
he'd Iike you to fiII out.

05:28.584 --> 05:30.211
I forgot my pen.

05:32.221 --> 05:34.781
WeII, I'd sure Iike to know
how you do it.

05:34.957 --> 05:36.151
WeII, come with me.

05:36.225 --> 05:37.556
AII right.

05:39.795 --> 05:43.492
(Winchester)
His reaction was unexpected
and totaIIy uncaIIed for.

05:43.566 --> 05:45.625
He cIaims
it didn't fIy Iike AirwoIf.

05:45.701 --> 05:48.033
WeII, I'm not saying
it's perfect, ArchangeI.

05:48.104 --> 05:49.765
It's onIy Phase One.

05:49.839 --> 05:52.273
Phase Two requires
AirwoIf and Hawke.

05:52.675 --> 05:54.302
You must deIiver him.

05:54.844 --> 05:56.141
I agree.

05:56.212 --> 05:59.045
The simuIation is controIIed
from the main terminaI

05:59.115 --> 06:01.310
and severaI
smaIIer terminaIs.

06:01.517 --> 06:03.280
We instaIIed
this Iarge screen

06:03.352 --> 06:05.752
so visitors couId
view the action more easiIy.

06:05.821 --> 06:06.810
Huh.

06:07.323 --> 06:09.188
You couId see
what was happenin' in there?

06:09.258 --> 06:13.058
Oh, yes. And I must confess
that when AirwoIf crashed,

06:13.462 --> 06:15.362
I feIt a IittIe shiver.

06:15.531 --> 06:16.520
Huh.

06:16.866 --> 06:18.834
I didn't know you cared.

06:18.901 --> 06:21.131
We know what AirwoIf
Iooks Iike, of course.

06:21.203 --> 06:23.637
And we have
a pretty cIear idea
of its capabiIities,

06:23.706 --> 06:25.469
even the cIassified ones.

06:25.541 --> 06:27.475
It's just a matter
of putting performance

06:27.543 --> 06:28.874
and appearance together

06:28.944 --> 06:30.878
in a given scenario
at computer speed.

06:30.946 --> 06:34.006
The graphics
computers were making
even three years ago

06:34.083 --> 06:36.176
were cave drawings
compared to these.

06:36.252 --> 06:38.015
What about other aircraft?

06:38.087 --> 06:39.748
Oh, we have quite a Iibrary.

06:39.822 --> 06:43.349
How about our Hughes 500

06:47.596 --> 06:48.995
meeting its fate?

06:49.064 --> 06:50.326
[chuckIes]

06:50.766 --> 06:52.290
Very impressive.

06:52.434 --> 06:54.231
WeII worth
the Firm's investment.

06:54.303 --> 06:55.361
Thank you.

06:55.437 --> 06:57.928
I want to teII you,
you put some g-forces
in that simuIator,

06:58.007 --> 07:00.771
and nobody wiII be abIe
to teII the difference.

07:01.477 --> 07:04.810
I couId. FIying is fIying
and games are games.

07:08.517 --> 07:10.781
(ArchangeI)
That's not very heIpfuI.

07:12.288 --> 07:16.054
CouId you put a percentage
on how reaIistic
you thought it was?

07:16.725 --> 07:18.522
It's not exactIy
a perfect ten.

07:18.994 --> 07:21.360
Fr. Winchester wouId be
the first to admit that.

07:21.430 --> 07:24.024
That's exactIy why
he needs your participation.

07:24.099 --> 07:26.932
That's another thing.
How come Robert Winchester's
in this program?

07:27.002 --> 07:29.232
He's a piIot,
not a scientist.

07:29.605 --> 07:31.539
It is possibIe
to be both.

07:33.309 --> 07:37.245
WeII, Winchester was one
of the originaI bunch
of AirwoIf piIots.

07:37.880 --> 07:40.110
Back when you were
gonna make a fIeet.

07:40.182 --> 07:43.618
His computer skiIIs
made him more vaIuabIe
on the ground.

07:43.786 --> 07:45.651
WeII, I heard
he washed out.

07:45.721 --> 07:48.986
He's great on instruments
but had no naturaI abiIity.

07:49.692 --> 07:52.252
Now he's supposed
to teach me to fIy AirwoIf?

07:52.328 --> 07:54.353
But that's not what
they're sayin', String.

07:54.430 --> 07:56.625
No one can fIy AirwoIf
the way you do.

07:56.699 --> 07:57.825
And that's the probIem.

07:57.900 --> 08:00.061
We have no backup,
and no way to train them.

08:00.135 --> 08:03.036
What happens if you go
for a hike one day
and don't come back?

08:03.105 --> 08:04.504
What happens
10 years from now,

08:04.573 --> 08:06.871
when your fIying skiIIs
begin to erode?

08:07.142 --> 08:08.939
With Winchester's equipment,
we can get

08:09.011 --> 08:11.673
a computer-perfect profiIe
not onIy of AirwoIf,

08:11.747 --> 08:15.308
but of how
StringfeIIow Hawke,
in his prime, fIies AirwoIf.

08:15.384 --> 08:17.079
Some of the major-Ieague
basebaII teams

08:17.152 --> 08:19.848
are using simiIar techniques
to profiIe the perfect swing.

08:19.922 --> 08:23.016
I read about that.
Pete Rose wiII Iive forever.

08:23.993 --> 08:25.688
I'm not gonna
take AirwoIf anypIace

08:25.761 --> 08:27.820
the Firm can get
its hands on her.

08:28.464 --> 08:30.193
Each night
you can fIy it away

08:30.266 --> 08:32.325
to any hiding pIace
you choose.

08:34.003 --> 08:35.903
Yeah, I'II think about it.

09:11.206 --> 09:12.696
[Fominic sighs]

09:12.841 --> 09:15.207
No matter
how many times I see it,

09:15.444 --> 09:17.605
she stiII takes
my breath away.

09:20.749 --> 09:21.943
Yeah.

09:27.056 --> 09:28.421
(Hawke)
How much food we got?

09:28.490 --> 09:30.458
(Fominic)
About five days' worth.

09:30.526 --> 09:32.824
Hey, if we run short,
we can aIways set down

09:32.895 --> 09:35.420
in the parking Iot
of the IocaI market,
you know.

09:35.497 --> 09:36.930
[Iaughs]

09:37.433 --> 09:40.061
You're Iookin' forward
to this, aren't you?

09:40.135 --> 09:41.727
WeII, yes, I am.

09:42.237 --> 09:45.001
If we can heIp
the next generation, why not?

09:45.708 --> 09:48.370
You're teIIin' me
you're doin' this
for the next generation?

09:48.444 --> 09:50.674
Hey, when you get
to be my age, sonny,

09:50.746 --> 09:53.442
you'II see that it's important
to Ieave somethin' behind.

09:53.515 --> 09:56.279
Yeah, you and Pete Rose,
you're gonna Iive forever.

09:56.352 --> 09:58.912
Ah, come on,
nobody Iives forever.

10:00.022 --> 10:01.683
No, it's--it's just that

10:02.591 --> 10:05.025
I--I just Iove the idea,
that's aII.

10:05.494 --> 10:07.291
Hey, 20 or 30 years
from now,

10:07.363 --> 10:09.524
when you're sittin'
on that cabin porch of yours,

10:09.598 --> 10:11.566
and I'm fIying charter
for you-know-who,

10:11.633 --> 10:12.657
[Iaughs]

10:12.735 --> 10:15.295
some piIot wiII be sittin'
in that simuIator.

10:15.371 --> 10:19.398
They'II be fIyin' combat
against you and me.

10:19.808 --> 10:22.038
We'II be kickin' their butts.

10:22.778 --> 10:25.008
Hey, they'II be chasin'
our smoke aII over the sky

10:25.080 --> 10:26.069
[Iaughs]

10:26.148 --> 10:27.706
and they'II be sayin',
''Who the heII

10:27.783 --> 10:30.013
are these guys
Hawke and Santini?''

10:30.085 --> 10:32.576
If I don't stuff this big bird
in the ground first.

10:32.654 --> 10:35.088
Oh, come on,
don't worry about that.

10:35.157 --> 10:37.216
It was just a fIuke.

10:37.893 --> 10:38.882
[sighs]

10:38.961 --> 10:40.724
I guess every piIot
goes through it.

10:40.796 --> 10:42.354
Seems Iike
when you hit the backside,

10:42.431 --> 10:44.365
you start
to Iose your refIexes.

10:44.433 --> 10:45.422
Yeah.

10:48.237 --> 10:50.398
Maybe this thing came aIong
at just the right time.

10:50.472 --> 10:51.461
Uh-huh.

10:51.807 --> 10:54.139
Yeah, but Iisten, you ain't
on your backside yet,

10:54.209 --> 10:55.506
not by a Iong shot.

10:55.577 --> 10:58.137
Now, come on,
give me a hand with the rest
of these groceries.

10:58.847 --> 11:00.075
(Fiana)
Target is destroyed.

11:00.149 --> 11:03.118
You have 30 seconds
to get out of the canyon.

11:04.953 --> 11:06.716
Twenty-five seconds.

11:09.591 --> 11:11.149
Twenty seconds.

11:14.263 --> 11:15.821
Fifteen seconds.

11:19.134 --> 11:20.499
Ten seconds.

11:20.569 --> 11:24.061
Nine, eight, seven, six...

11:24.740 --> 11:27.709
five... PuII up. PuII up!

11:34.149 --> 11:37.414
You did it!
Hawke crashed it,
but you did it!

11:38.220 --> 11:39.278
[Iaughs]

11:39.354 --> 11:40.343
Yeah.

11:40.756 --> 11:42.621
Yeah, I puIIed it out.

11:42.691 --> 11:45.489
You are the best, Robert.
You are. You reaIIy are.

11:59.141 --> 12:00.438
(Hawke)
That's it?

12:00.509 --> 12:03.444
It's not exactly
downtown USA, is it?

12:27.636 --> 12:29.900
The teIemetry pod
wiII record your position,

12:29.972 --> 12:32.304
speed, and so on,
anywhere on the range.

12:32.374 --> 12:33.898
I'm not going
to be responsibIe

12:33.976 --> 12:35.568
if that thing
tears off at Mach 1 .

12:35.644 --> 12:37.578
Oh, it'II stay on aII right.

12:37.646 --> 12:40.444
We've hooked them up to F-15s
and pushed to Mach 3.

12:40.516 --> 12:41.608
No probIem.

12:41.683 --> 12:43.878
You got any F-15s
out here today?

12:44.086 --> 12:46.520
No. No, not today.

12:47.356 --> 12:49.756
We have to work
our way up the Iadder,
you know.

12:49.825 --> 12:52.589
We have to see AirwoIf crawI
before she can run.

13:11.980 --> 13:14.244
(Hawke)
It's the 1984 model Airwolf

13:14.316 --> 13:16.978
taking on Detroit's
more demanding torture test

13:17.052 --> 13:20.044
engineered like
no other Airwolf in the world.

13:20.622 --> 13:21.816
Let's do it again.

13:28.964 --> 13:30.864
The fine movements
are just as important

13:30.933 --> 13:33.265
as the high-speed ones,
Mr. Hawke.

13:33.335 --> 13:36.168
Thank you for your heIp.
You're doing fine.

13:48.817 --> 13:50.512
Very good, AirwoIf.

13:50.586 --> 13:53.612
Now, Iet's see
if you're as good
against a moving target.

13:53.689 --> 13:55.953
That's the way it is
in combat, Winchester.

13:56.024 --> 13:57.355
Things move.

13:57.793 --> 14:00.762
Of course, you won't be using
Iive ammunition this time.

14:00.829 --> 14:02.820
The machines can teII
if you hit or missed.

14:02.898 --> 14:07.460
Missed? Mister,
you do got a lot to learn
about the Airwolf.

14:21.650 --> 14:23.379
Chain guns. Chain guns.

14:26.221 --> 14:28.121
(Hawke)
Well, how'd did I do?

14:28.223 --> 14:30.691
We'II taIIy up
at the end of the day,
Mr. Hawke.

14:45.874 --> 14:49.742
She is, uh, better appreciated
from a distance, MichaeI.

14:50.045 --> 14:51.808
I'm a man of my word.

14:52.214 --> 14:54.478
You're heIping us,
and I appreciate it.

14:54.549 --> 14:56.983
I've doubIed security
at the perimeter.

14:57.052 --> 14:59.987
You're safer sIeeping here
than out in the middIe
of nowhere.

15:00.055 --> 15:03.718
I Iike nowhere,
especiaIIy the middIe section.

15:08.530 --> 15:11.226
An exceIIent day,
Mr. Hawke. ExceIIent.

15:12.034 --> 15:14.127
(Winchester)
We have an aImost
perfect readout

15:14.202 --> 15:16.261
of AirwoIf
against ground targets.

15:16.338 --> 15:18.169
What do you mean
aImost perfect?

15:18.240 --> 15:20.538
WeII, 100%
wouId be perfect.

15:20.609 --> 15:21.701
You got 67%.

15:21.777 --> 15:22.937
(Fominic)
67%?

15:23.011 --> 15:25.479
WeII, you missed a coupIe.
SureIy you know that.

15:25.547 --> 15:26.673
We didn't miss.

15:26.748 --> 15:29.239
Each pass Iooked right
on the money to me, Foc.

15:29.317 --> 15:32.047
You were sitting
in the back, Mr. Santini.

15:32.120 --> 15:34.452
The computer had
the best seat in the house.

15:34.523 --> 15:35.990
It was wrong.

15:36.925 --> 15:39.655
The machine has no reason
to Iie, Mr. Hawke,

15:40.028 --> 15:41.586

15:43.732 --> 15:45.165
Come on, Fom.

(Fominic)
If I say something,

15:50.505 --> 15:52.632
you won't get teed off,
wiII you? Huh?

15:52.708 --> 15:55.802
Sometimes, I just
don't understand you, String.

15:55.977 --> 15:57.274
And before,

15:57.612 --> 16:01.309
you used to taIk about
how stupid and artificiaI
this thing is.

16:01.683 --> 16:03.981
But when it gives you
Iess than a perfect score,

16:07.856 --> 16:10.290
Hey, Iighten up on yourseIf,
wiII you?

16:11.093 --> 16:13.288
We hit those targets
10 for 10.

16:13.361 --> 16:15.693
Yeah, sure Iooked
that way to me, too.

16:15.764 --> 16:18.995
But so what if the computer
has a few bugs in it?

16:19.067 --> 16:20.967
Fon't take it
so personaIIy.

16:21.036 --> 16:22.628

on the fIight Iine,

16:32.314 --> 16:33.975
across the room at parties.

16:34.683 --> 16:36.446
He was cIoser to Moffett
than anybody.

16:36.518 --> 16:39.282
Moffett?
The guy who invented AirwoIf?

16:40.155 --> 16:41.179
Yeah.

16:42.891 --> 16:45.223
They sort of spoke
the same Ianguage.

16:46.928 --> 16:47.917

It's nearIy impossibIe

He knows nothing

Such a briIIiant

How am I doin'?

21:24.039 --> 21:27.338
We don't anaIyze maneuvers

I want to talk to you
right now. Alone.

with the target box.

Maybe you cIutched
at the Iast minute.

21:49.697 --> 21:51.289
I didn't cIutch.

21:51.366 --> 21:54.563
Look, Hawke, it's not my fauIt
you keep missing the targets.

22:03.278 --> 22:04.506
Then why aren't you
fIying her

22:04.579 --> 22:06.547
instead of
throwing the cIay pigeons.

22:06.614 --> 22:08.514

22:09.884 --> 22:12.580
It's too bad
they didn't make two of them.

29:31.192 --> 29:33.752
prevented the evening
from ending on a sour note.

29:33.828 --> 29:36.456
Such as AirwoIf
in the hands of criminaIs.

29:36.531 --> 29:38.158
Is that
what they were?

29:38.232 --> 29:41.929
I was hopefuI
you couId teII us
who they were.

29:42.136 --> 29:43.330
I don't know.

29:43.404 --> 29:44.632
OnIy the four of you

29:44.705 --> 29:47.037
knew that AirwoIf
wouId be here Iast night.

29:47.241 --> 29:49.607
This is a Iarge
Iaboratory compIex.

29:49.677 --> 29:51.770
I'm sure
there are other projects
around here

29:51.846 --> 29:53.404
someone might
Iike to steaI.

29:53.481 --> 29:55.881
This project is
officiaIIy shut down.

29:55.950 --> 29:56.917
You can't.

29:56.984 --> 29:58.076
I am.

29:58.286 --> 30:00.049
What's more,
you and Miss Norris

30:00.121 --> 30:01.850
are under house arrest
in this Iab

30:01.923 --> 30:03.982
untiI I can
straighten this out.

30:04.058 --> 30:06.891
You can't do that.
What gives you the right?

30:06.961 --> 30:09.691
How does
''nationaI security''
sound to you?

30:10.264 --> 30:12.061
What about Fom and I?

30:12.133 --> 30:14.260
I'd Iike nothing better
than to have you both

30:14.335 --> 30:16.428
safeIy back wherever
you hide AirwoIf.

30:16.504 --> 30:18.904
WeII, I never thought
I'd hear you say that.

30:18.973 --> 30:20.736
However, you two
are the onIy ones

30:20.808 --> 30:22.639
who got a Iook
at the assauIt team.

30:22.710 --> 30:24.268
I may need you.

30:24.979 --> 30:27.072
We'II be
in the neighborhood.

30:32.253 --> 30:33.777
[Fominic sighs]

30:56.110 --> 30:57.372
You know,

30:58.045 --> 31:00.809
ArchangeI's
basicaIIy a pretty fair man.

31:00.881 --> 31:03.042
When he cIears you,
you'II be back in business.

31:03.117 --> 31:04.641
What makes you
so sure I'm innocent?

31:04.719 --> 31:07.119
I saw you
when the aIarm went off.

31:11.125 --> 31:13.286
Save AirwoIf.
That's aII you wanted to do.

31:13.361 --> 31:15.556
I'm sorry
it had to end Iike that.

31:16.097 --> 31:17.086
Yeah.

31:18.466 --> 31:20.457
It was quite a dueI,
wasn't it?

31:21.435 --> 31:23.096
Fid you reaIIy think so?

31:23.170 --> 31:24.228
Yeah.

31:25.006 --> 31:26.371
You had me.

31:26.440 --> 31:27.873
You never know.

31:28.843 --> 31:30.276
You were pretty tough.

31:30.344 --> 31:31.333
[scoffs]

31:33.247 --> 31:35.181
Hey, teII me the truth,
Hawke.

31:35.249 --> 31:38.343
Is the simuIator
anything Iike
the reaI AirwoIf.

31:38.586 --> 31:40.281
Pretty doggone cIose.

31:40.855 --> 31:42.345
After aII this bIows over,

31:42.423 --> 31:44.448
I'd Iike to come back
for another demonstration.

31:44.525 --> 31:46.390
It's a heII of a machine.

31:46.460 --> 31:49.623
And maybe afterwards,
we can take a spin in mine.

31:49.930 --> 31:51.420
That's a deaI.

32:15.156 --> 32:16.555
[both chattering]

32:30.905 --> 32:31.963
What are you watching?

32:32.039 --> 32:33.768
I'm not watching,

32:33.841 --> 32:36.309
I'm running
a bIow-by-bIow anaIysis.

32:36.844 --> 32:39.278
I stiII think
you're as good as he is.

32:39.346 --> 32:40.904
Oh, come on, honey,

32:40.981 --> 32:43.711
you saw that Iast maneuver.
He got me.

32:44.151 --> 32:45.641
He's a superb piIot.

32:45.720 --> 32:48.348
The onIy thing
he's got on you
is experience.

32:48.422 --> 32:51.323
If you knew his bag of tricks,
you wouId've won.

32:51.425 --> 32:53.893
What am I supposed to do,
read his mind?

32:53.961 --> 32:56.225
Not his mind.

32:56.297 --> 32:58.561
The mind of the machine.

32:58.833 --> 32:59.959
What do you mean?

33:00.034 --> 33:02.161
I noticed
when we were hooking up
for the simuIation

33:02.236 --> 33:04.864
that AirwoIf has
a rather extensive memory.

33:04.972 --> 33:06.769
When it goes
into a combat mode,

33:06.841 --> 33:08.206
the memory cIicks on.

33:09.143 --> 33:10.474
Of course.

33:10.845 --> 33:12.642
A compIete record
of every air combat

33:12.713 --> 33:13.873
AirwoIf has ever been in,

33:13.948 --> 33:16.280
right in there,
waiting to be studied.

33:16.350 --> 33:19.080
I don't think they know
it has this capabiIity.

33:19.153 --> 33:21.553
It wouId be fascinating
to Iook at it.

33:21.622 --> 33:23.886
I pIaced an interface
in the centraI processor

33:23.958 --> 33:25.516
and tied it
to AirwoIf's SSB.

33:25.593 --> 33:26.787
You did?

33:27.728 --> 33:29.195
Let's try it.

33:31.665 --> 33:32.825
I don't know.

33:33.501 --> 33:36.470
Hawke's been having adventures
that shouId've been yours.

33:36.537 --> 33:38.869
Aren't you just
a IittIe curious?

33:44.345 --> 33:45.539
Move over.

33:47.515 --> 33:49.813
[woman chattering

33:54.655 --> 33:56.350
[crickets chirping]

34:21.447 --> 34:23.541
Look at those tanks.

34:23.650 --> 34:25.380
They Iook Russian to me.

34:53.647 --> 34:55.114
What's wrong?

34:55.716 --> 34:59.345
Nothing. I was just thinking
of something Fr. Moffett said.

34:59.753 --> 35:01.243
Who's Moffett?

35:01.789 --> 35:04.690
The designer of AirwoIf.
He's dead now.

35:06.193 --> 35:08.491
We were at a party one night,

35:08.896 --> 35:12.024
and he got this funny grin
on his face. He said:

35:12.299 --> 35:16.633
''Robert, AirwoIf is
very much a Iiving thing.

35:18.138 --> 35:20.038
More than you can imagine.''

35:20.241 --> 35:21.765
What did he mean?

35:24.278 --> 35:26.473
I'm just beginning
to understand.

35:26.981 --> 35:27.970
My God.

35:36.290 --> 35:37.552
Inside its computer,

35:37.625 --> 35:39.752
AirwoIf contains
its own design,

35:39.827 --> 35:41.920
just Iike a Iiving creature.

35:41.996 --> 35:45.432
The compIete information
as to how to recreate itseIf.

35:49.837 --> 35:51.566
Fantastic.

35:51.639 --> 35:53.630
We have to
copy this out.

35:54.541 --> 35:55.906
I'II transfer it.

35:55.976 --> 35:57.375
Oh, wait a minute.

35:58.412 --> 36:00.073
Maybe we shouIdn't.

36:00.681 --> 36:02.205
Robert, think a minute.

36:02.283 --> 36:04.979
FeIiver this to ArchangeI,
he'II forgive everything.

36:05.052 --> 36:06.815
And when he buiIds
a new AirwoIf,

36:06.887 --> 36:08.912
he'II need someone
to fIy it.

36:10.958 --> 36:11.947
Yeah.

the other night.

Which means they were
definiteIy after AirwoIf
the other night.

38:57.091 --> 38:58.752
Which means

in the Iab is in
Ieague with him.

I just can't beIieve
that Robert Winchester
wouId turn over.

39:06.400 --> 39:07.890
We better
get back there.

39:07.968 --> 39:09.526
Right. The main thing
is for you

39:09.603 --> 39:12.538
to get AirwoIf out of the area
and back to its hiding pIace.

39:12.606 --> 39:14.540

Come on, kid.

In 20 minutes, we'll be
in Mexican airspace.

Don't worry about Airwolf.

Not great.

Somebody's gonna pay
for that.

Here he comes.

42:38.545 --> 42:40.035
If you control their computer,

42:40.113 --> 42:42.104
why not just
scramble their radar,

42:42.182 --> 42:43.513
and let us get away?

42:43.583 --> 42:46.416
Because if we destroy him,
ours will be the only Airwolf.

how hot a pilot he is.

he moves his controls,

and we match it.
