WEBVTT

00:00.094 --> 00:01.562
Previously on "Bitten"...

00:01.898 --> 00:04.132
Accept Elena as your new Alpha.

00:05.201 --> 00:06.400
I do.

00:06.402 --> 00:08.135
Together we can fix this.

00:08.137 --> 00:09.169
How?

00:09.171 --> 00:12.170
It's not my father that needs to die.

00:12.195 --> 00:14.028
There is no need to test me, Jeremy,

00:14.030 --> 00:15.229
I will not betray you.

00:15.231 --> 00:17.108
This blood feud has cost us both dearly.

00:17.133 --> 00:19.323
If you can get
me close to Roman,

00:19.414 --> 00:20.747
I will see this through.

00:22.867 --> 00:24.066
He's coming for us,

00:24.068 --> 00:25.268
the red-eyed wolf.

00:25.270 --> 00:26.469
He tore my mother's throat out,

00:26.471 --> 00:28.003
like she was made from paper.

00:28.005 --> 00:29.939
Nick!

00:29.941 --> 00:31.274
Katia!

00:33.378 --> 00:36.779
My brother... and my father...

00:36.781 --> 00:38.914
Elena... save them.

00:40.785 --> 00:42.918
This premonition, if that's what it is,

00:42.920 --> 00:45.121
makes me fear myself.

00:45.123 --> 00:46.756
When will it stop?

00:51.229 --> 00:52.527
It won't stop.

00:52.529 --> 00:55.064
Not until it happens.

00:55.066 --> 00:56.298
It's not like a bad dream

00:56.300 --> 00:57.932
that you can just shake off.

00:59.403 --> 01:01.536
It will happen.

01:01.538 --> 01:04.205
A premonition is like
a dream in this way:

01:04.206 --> 01:05.774
it's not literal.

01:05.776 --> 01:08.109
It needs to be interpreted.

01:08.111 --> 01:11.513
I'm going to cause the
destruction of Stonehaven.

01:14.084 --> 01:15.549
I burn it all down.

01:18.121 --> 01:20.188
This house has a dark heart.

01:20.190 --> 01:22.623
There is brutality here.

01:22.625 --> 01:24.159
Despite everything that is good

01:24.161 --> 01:25.526
and worth fighting for,

01:25.528 --> 01:28.196
that heart still beats.

01:28.198 --> 01:30.498
You know what it is.

01:30.500 --> 01:32.232
The need to kill.

01:33.135 --> 01:34.568
Wolves kill to eat.

01:34.570 --> 01:36.537
Why do werewolves kill?

01:38.408 --> 01:40.941
To protect ourselves.

01:40.943 --> 01:43.243
Is that why Jeremy killed that woman?

01:44.980 --> 01:47.414
Humans can't know about our secret.

01:47.416 --> 01:49.950
It's our number one rule.

01:49.952 --> 01:51.451
Is it really your rule?

01:53.088 --> 01:54.288
I'm one of them.

01:54.290 --> 01:56.056
Not completely.

01:56.058 --> 01:59.293
This has always been a society of men.

01:59.295 --> 02:01.761
Roman, Jeremy, all of the Alphas.

02:01.763 --> 02:04.464
They're fighting for power.
This is what men do.

02:04.466 --> 02:06.299
You are not like them.

02:07.268 --> 02:09.035
You are one of a kind.

02:09.037 --> 02:11.671
The single most important.

02:11.673 --> 02:14.073
You're the lone woman in their world.

02:14.075 --> 02:16.710
You can see the cracks.

02:16.712 --> 02:21.147
You can feel the brutality of it.

02:21.149 --> 02:22.982
Maybe you're the flame.

02:22.984 --> 02:26.752
Maybe you need to burn.

02:26.754 --> 02:30.489
I want it all to change, but...

02:30.491 --> 02:33.359
I don't know how to
do that without death

02:33.361 --> 02:34.827
and destruction and violence

02:34.829 --> 02:37.696
and hurting the people that I love.

02:37.698 --> 02:40.466
Elena, it doesn't have to be that way.

02:42.269 --> 02:44.436
Change does not have to be cruel.

02:47.207 --> 02:49.641
Then whose blood am I covered in?

02:51.000 --> 02:57.074

We're behind you all the way.

03:35.290 --> 03:37.323
I don't know if the others will be.

03:37.325 --> 03:38.691
That's why they're here.

03:38.693 --> 03:41.227
We're going to find
out where they stand.

03:41.229 --> 03:43.830
If they're on board, the
rest will fall in line.

03:45.733 --> 03:47.700
What if this is the end?

03:49.237 --> 03:52.805
What if I the cause of the
destruction of our Pack?

03:52.807 --> 03:54.640
That's not going to happen.

03:55.609 --> 03:57.042
How do you know?

03:58.379 --> 04:01.112
Because Jeremy believes in you,

04:01.114 --> 04:02.247
and so do I.

04:08.155 --> 04:09.454
Everybody's here.

04:09.456 --> 04:10.822
Are you ready?

04:21.301 --> 04:24.069
Why did it have to be here?

04:24.071 --> 04:25.636
This is as good a place as any

04:25.638 --> 04:27.472
to bury your sister.

04:27.474 --> 04:29.940
- She's so alone out here.
- Yeah.

04:29.942 --> 04:31.676
She's with her mother now.

04:31.678 --> 04:33.944
She should be with us.

04:33.946 --> 04:35.613
Mom should be with us too.

04:35.615 --> 04:37.014
It's because of you they aren't.

04:37.016 --> 04:39.016
Alexei, please don't say that.

04:39.018 --> 04:40.585
My heart is already broken.

04:40.587 --> 04:43.587
- Then why didn't you protect them?
- I tried.

04:43.589 --> 04:45.022
I did everything I could

04:45.024 --> 04:46.423
to watch over you and your sister.

04:46.425 --> 04:49.026
Katia looked after me.

04:49.028 --> 04:52.696
She looked after me
more than anyone else.

04:52.698 --> 04:54.164
You know, taking that baby was crazy,

04:54.166 --> 04:56.867
but she did it for me,
she did it for us.

04:58.170 --> 05:00.570
- And you let her die.
- Alexei, please, Li...

05:00.572 --> 05:02.539
listen, just listen to me, okay?

05:02.541 --> 05:04.508
You have gone through your first Change.

05:04.510 --> 05:07.811
Your emotions, they are
running wild, I know that.

05:07.813 --> 05:09.646
But you need to learn to control them.

05:09.648 --> 05:11.681
We have to stick together. Yeah?

05:11.683 --> 05:13.383
You, me, Elena.

05:13.385 --> 05:15.818
Elena! Elena!

05:15.820 --> 05:17.486
If you didn't come looking for her,

05:17.488 --> 05:19.923
Katia would still be alive!

05:23.694 --> 05:25.895
She'd be punching my arm.

05:27.532 --> 05:28.764
She'd be calling me a jerk

05:28.766 --> 05:31.434
with that stupid look on her face.

05:31.436 --> 05:33.068
She'd sing for me...

05:33.070 --> 05:35.604
- Alexei, I'm sorry...
- No, no more.

05:37.107 --> 05:39.074
I'm going to kill that red-eyed wolf,

05:39.076 --> 05:40.443
and Roman.

05:40.445 --> 05:42.545
I'm going to kill all
of them if I have to!

05:42.547 --> 05:44.212
You can't kill everything.
That's not the answer.

05:44.214 --> 05:45.614
You don't have the answers.

05:45.616 --> 05:47.015
I'm going to find my own.

06:06.470 --> 06:08.570
Have you heard anything?

06:08.572 --> 06:10.338
No. Konstantin hasn't called

06:10.340 --> 06:12.206
and Jeremy's cellphone has died.

06:12.208 --> 06:13.842
We don't know what's going on.

06:13.844 --> 06:16.478
I fear that trusting
Konstantin was a mistake.

06:16.480 --> 06:17.912
It's a risk, but...

06:17.914 --> 06:20.014
he wants his father
gone as much as we do.

06:20.016 --> 06:22.283
Jeremy and Konstantin
could be dead by now.

06:22.285 --> 06:24.385
Which means we're next.

06:24.387 --> 06:27.688
Without an Alpha, they'll
hunt us down, one by one.

06:27.690 --> 06:30.424
We have an Alpha.

06:30.426 --> 06:31.892
Jeremy stepped down.

06:31.894 --> 06:33.927
Elena has control of the Pack.

06:33.929 --> 06:35.762
Anyone has the right to challenge.

06:35.764 --> 06:38.398
You do it now or you follow.

06:40.669 --> 06:43.370
No. No more.

06:45.007 --> 06:46.773
We're not going to
blindly follow an Alpha,

06:46.775 --> 06:48.675
me or anyone else.

06:52.548 --> 06:53.881
Look around you.

06:55.750 --> 06:58.718
These shelves are filled
with that mistake:

06:58.720 --> 07:00.987
wolves killed for not following.

07:02.891 --> 07:05.992
Bloodlines recorded like royalty.

07:08.130 --> 07:11.163
A whole history of suffering and pain.

07:12.834 --> 07:14.199
For what?

07:19.240 --> 07:21.473
This isn't how we protect our kind.

07:22.544 --> 07:24.544
This gang mentality,

07:24.546 --> 07:25.745
it stops today,

07:25.747 --> 07:27.079
right now.

07:32.886 --> 07:35.754
You can go,

07:35.756 --> 07:38.390
or you stay and fight with us...

07:39.960 --> 07:42.127
but not because of Pack Law.

07:46.900 --> 07:49.333
We're more than just wolves.

07:49.335 --> 07:50.969
We're humans.

07:53.139 --> 07:56.741
We can feel each other's pain

07:56.743 --> 07:59.410
and we can share our happiness.

08:02.282 --> 08:04.215
We can love...

08:08.020 --> 08:10.020
and we can be loved.

08:13.560 --> 08:14.992
That's our bond.

08:16.596 --> 08:18.095
No more Packs.

08:18.097 --> 08:20.097
We are a found family.

08:22.568 --> 08:23.767
If you choose to stay,

08:23.769 --> 08:26.470
I won't demand your loyalty.

08:31.543 --> 08:33.409
I'll promise you mine.

08:40.018 --> 08:43.120
You are my Alpha.

08:49.461 --> 08:50.893
You are my Alpha.

08:59.303 --> 09:02.138
Well, I always wanted a family.

09:06.410 --> 09:08.043
You're my Alpha.

09:08.045 --> 09:09.512
Where do you need me?

09:12.483 --> 09:14.082
Well, for starters,

09:14.084 --> 09:16.252
we have to bring Jeremy back to us.

09:41.178 --> 09:44.245
What was your plan, Danvers?

09:44.247 --> 09:46.714
Were you going to sneak in

09:46.716 --> 09:48.816
and assassinate me?

09:48.818 --> 09:50.185
By yourself?

09:51.788 --> 09:54.489
I always knew you to be arrogant,

09:54.491 --> 09:56.290
but not a fool.

09:58.260 --> 10:01.762
All of this bloodshed needs to end,

10:01.764 --> 10:04.165
one way or another.

10:04.167 --> 10:07.101
You thought to end it with my blood?

10:09.005 --> 10:10.304
I am an Alpha.

10:10.306 --> 10:13.073
Killing me is no small matter.

10:13.075 --> 10:16.476
You would have to answer
to the Alpha Council.

10:16.478 --> 10:17.678
What then?

10:17.680 --> 10:19.479
This is my territory.

10:19.481 --> 10:23.217
You are harbouring a Russian Mutt.

10:25.020 --> 10:28.355
- A traitor.
- You had my people killed.

10:28.357 --> 10:30.990
And I have the right to
do with you as I see fit.

10:30.992 --> 10:34.360
Mm, maybe so...

10:34.362 --> 10:36.495
but they won't hear your side.

10:36.497 --> 10:38.497
Escobado was right.

10:38.499 --> 10:42.168
You will be forgotten in death.

10:42.170 --> 10:43.502
We both will.

10:44.806 --> 10:47.306
And what are you going to
say to the Alpha Council?

10:49.043 --> 10:51.544
You arrived here with
an army of your men.

10:51.546 --> 10:53.112
It was an invasion.

10:54.315 --> 10:57.116
And the rest of them
will begin to worry,

10:57.118 --> 10:59.285
"What if I'm next?"

10:59.287 --> 11:00.786
How long do you think it will take

11:00.788 --> 11:02.221
before they want your head?

11:02.223 --> 11:04.056
We have the largest Pack.

11:04.058 --> 11:06.725
What could they do to us?

11:06.727 --> 11:08.794
Your Pack has money troubles.

11:08.796 --> 11:10.062
What are they going to think

11:10.064 --> 11:12.397
when they realize that
you have spent it all,

11:12.399 --> 11:15.300
that you sacrificed them
for a personal vendetta?

11:15.302 --> 11:16.468
Enough.

11:16.470 --> 11:20.204
I have only one decision to make:

11:20.206 --> 11:22.774
what is the best way for you to die?

11:48.839 --> 11:51.407
Katia never liked the forest.

11:51.409 --> 11:53.309
She always wanted to live in a city,

11:53.311 --> 11:55.710
surrounded by people.

11:55.712 --> 11:57.946
I couldn't give that to her.

12:02.085 --> 12:03.284
Hey.

12:05.689 --> 12:09.290
I wish I could've known her better.

12:09.292 --> 12:13.361
When she was small, she would
draw these pictures of herself,

12:13.363 --> 12:14.628
and always, in these pictures,

12:14.630 --> 12:17.298
she would have one arm up in the air.

12:17.300 --> 12:18.799
I asked her, I said, "Katia,

12:18.801 --> 12:21.502
who are you waving to?"

12:21.504 --> 12:23.972
And she would say to me,
"I'm not waving, Papa,

12:23.974 --> 12:26.607
I'm waiting for you to hold my hand."

12:28.211 --> 12:29.910
My darling girl.

12:31.113 --> 12:33.013
You did what you could.

12:33.015 --> 12:34.348
It's not your fault.

12:34.350 --> 12:36.650
I didn't do enough.

12:36.652 --> 12:38.719
My children are the best parts of me

12:38.721 --> 12:40.888
and you all deserve better than me.

12:42.758 --> 12:46.726
You and Alexei...

12:46.728 --> 12:49.162
you're all I have left in this world.

12:49.164 --> 12:52.432
I couldn't bear to lose
either one of you.

12:52.434 --> 12:55.302
I'm going to take Alexei
away from all this.

12:55.304 --> 12:57.437
We will disappear.

12:57.439 --> 12:59.806
I want you to come with us.

12:59.808 --> 13:01.408
- I can't.
- Bring Clay...

13:02.377 --> 13:03.643
and start your own family.

13:03.645 --> 13:05.111
Save yourself from all this madness.

13:05.113 --> 13:07.547
Leave it behind before it destroys you.

13:09.618 --> 13:12.184
They're my family

13:12.186 --> 13:13.920
as much as you are.

13:33.908 --> 13:35.507
What are you doing?

13:35.509 --> 13:36.909
He will feel every stroke

13:36.911 --> 13:38.977
- for what he has done.
- Wait.

13:38.979 --> 13:40.913
You will get your revenge,

13:40.915 --> 13:43.381
but Danvers was right.
We must think ahead.

13:43.383 --> 13:44.683
If the other Alphas move against us,

13:44.685 --> 13:46.184
we will not have the men to take them on

13:46.186 --> 13:47.986
and we will not have the money
to keep our Pack going.

13:47.988 --> 13:49.755
There is much to plunder right here.

13:49.757 --> 13:51.689
Stop with this dancing
around, Konstantin.

13:51.691 --> 13:52.890
I don't have the patience for it.

13:52.892 --> 13:54.892
Danvers is not going anywhere.

13:54.894 --> 13:56.761
We have time to make
sure he takes the blame

13:56.763 --> 13:59.130
for everything, before you kill him.

14:01.268 --> 14:03.000
I'm listening.

14:03.002 --> 14:04.602
Make him admit it.

14:04.604 --> 14:06.871
Make it plain for all to see.

14:09.375 --> 14:11.676
He knows he will not
get out of here alive.

14:11.678 --> 14:14.812
No amount of torture
will bring him to heel.

14:14.814 --> 14:16.881
You will not need torture.

14:16.883 --> 14:19.884
Offer him something he
wants more than life.

14:36.268 --> 14:37.734
_

14:40.150 --> 14:41.478
_

14:55.453 --> 14:57.920
This has gone on long enough.

14:57.922 --> 15:00.623
Jeremy, I got you into
Roman's stronghold,

15:00.625 --> 15:01.924
as I promised.

15:01.926 --> 15:03.426
You are still in one piece.

15:03.428 --> 15:05.894
And Roman will not kill you. Not yet.

15:05.896 --> 15:07.863
This is not our agreement.

15:07.865 --> 15:09.932
I have a pretence in place...

15:09.934 --> 15:13.802
I am not interested in playing
games anymore, Konstantin.

15:16.406 --> 15:17.873
Unleash me now.

15:17.875 --> 15:20.509
I told Elena I would bring
you back to Stonehaven

15:20.511 --> 15:22.310
and I will. I just need time

15:22.312 --> 15:23.846
to get these men out of here.

15:23.848 --> 15:25.180
Neither of us wants war

15:25.182 --> 15:28.583
and I cannot have anyone
know I helped you.

15:28.585 --> 15:32.954
Especially not if you would like
to become Alpha without challenge.

15:34.591 --> 15:36.090
Then you understand.

15:37.327 --> 15:38.660
Hmm.

15:40.364 --> 15:43.198
There is only one way we all win.

15:43.200 --> 15:45.167
Keep him occupied.

15:48.104 --> 15:50.538
My trust has limits.

15:50.540 --> 15:52.173
Yes,

15:52.175 --> 15:53.607
but you're locked up

15:53.609 --> 15:56.343
and I am your only friend in here.

15:56.345 --> 15:58.245
If I die,

15:58.247 --> 15:59.781
it does not necessarily mean

15:59.783 --> 16:02.449
that Roman will not find
out what you've done.

16:02.451 --> 16:04.051
You will get your revenge, Jeremy,

16:04.053 --> 16:07.054
and you will save both
your Pack and mine.

16:25.774 --> 16:27.174
He's gone to the north.

16:27.176 --> 16:29.275
There's a clear scent in that direction.

16:29.277 --> 16:31.778
No, it's the east. I'm sure of it.

16:31.780 --> 16:33.646
Elena, it can't be both.

16:34.717 --> 16:36.482
- Do you have your phone?
- Yeah.

16:36.484 --> 16:37.817
Set your GPS.

16:41.489 --> 16:43.122
Elena?

16:43.124 --> 16:45.592
Nick,
the Albino's here.

16:48.129 --> 16:50.963
Say that again, Elena. The
Albino's at Stonehaven.

16:50.965 --> 16:52.865
Sasha and I are tracking
him in the woods.

16:52.867 --> 16:54.499
Where are you right now?

16:54.501 --> 16:56.102
Nick can track our phones.

16:57.205 --> 16:59.171
Give me one second.

17:04.545 --> 17:06.979
- Okay, I have you.
- All right, stay put. We are on our way.

17:06.981 --> 17:08.280
The Albino's on the move.

17:08.281 --> 17:10.181
We have to get eyes on
him, take him down.

17:10.183 --> 17:11.717
It's going to take all of us.

17:11.719 --> 17:13.618
Don't do anything until we get there.

17:17.523 --> 17:18.890
We can't wait.

17:18.892 --> 17:20.291
He is alone out here.

17:20.294 --> 17:22.661
This is our best chance.

17:22.663 --> 17:24.563
We split up.

17:24.565 --> 17:26.564
You find him, you signal.

17:26.566 --> 17:28.233
Nothing more, okay?

17:34.808 --> 17:36.808
What are you doing?

18:57.421 --> 18:59.822
Nick, the Albino set
a decoy to the east.

18:59.824 --> 19:01.857
I've been following the scent of blood.

19:01.859 --> 19:03.625
My father's on the real trail.

19:07.530 --> 19:09.197
Ah!

19:21.611 --> 19:22.977
Elena!

19:22.979 --> 19:26.046
Okay, Clay and Alexei are
on their way to you now.

19:26.048 --> 19:28.483
Tell them to go north.

19:28.485 --> 19:29.751
Where's Sasha?

19:29.753 --> 19:30.951
He's northwest of you,

19:30.953 --> 19:32.420
about 600 or 700 yards.

19:32.422 --> 19:33.788
Is he moving?

19:33.790 --> 19:35.089
No, he's in one spot.

19:35.091 --> 19:37.358
He must have found him.

19:37.360 --> 19:38.926
I'm on my way.

19:44.100 --> 19:46.000
I just lost his signal.

19:47.469 --> 19:49.003
Elena, do you hear me?

19:51.240 --> 19:52.373
Elena.

19:58.246 --> 20:00.414
You've
almost reached Elena Michaels.

20:00.416 --> 20:01.748
Leave a message.

20:04.713 --> 20:06.176
We're here. There isn't any sign of her.

20:06.541 --> 20:08.240
Elena
said he was using a decoy.

20:08.449 --> 20:10.250
Both of their phones went
out at the same time.

20:10.275 --> 20:13.173
T-that's impossible. The Albino
can't be in two places at once.

20:13.205 --> 20:15.205
I don't think he's working alone, Clay.

20:15.207 --> 20:17.773
What... They would've smelled
any other werewolves out here.

20:17.775 --> 20:19.376
There's only his scent.

20:26.418 --> 20:28.351
- He was hiding in here.
- Goddammit.

20:28.353 --> 20:31.354
We have to find out
where he's taken them.

21:01.552 --> 21:03.185
Tell me something.

21:05.089 --> 21:06.455
Why are you here?

21:06.457 --> 21:10.224
I am here to make you pay
for your sins, Roman.

21:10.226 --> 21:11.993
You could have sent anyone,

21:11.995 --> 21:14.062
but here you are...

21:14.064 --> 21:17.098
an Alpha all alone.

21:17.100 --> 21:19.067
This is personal for me.

21:19.069 --> 21:22.771
Oh, it is personal for me,

21:22.773 --> 21:24.539
but why is it for you?

21:24.541 --> 21:26.907
Do you remember that woman you stabbed?

21:26.909 --> 21:28.476
The one with the gun.

21:29.546 --> 21:31.546
What about her?

21:31.548 --> 21:33.147
I had to kill her.

21:33.149 --> 21:34.648
So? What does it matter?

21:34.650 --> 21:36.417
She was a nosy human.

21:36.419 --> 21:39.487
You are here because I
inconvenienced you?

21:41.323 --> 21:44.157
She was a good person.

21:44.159 --> 21:46.927
And you...

21:46.929 --> 21:48.161
and your blood feud

21:48.163 --> 21:51.065
created a series of events

21:51.067 --> 21:52.967
that led to her death.

21:52.969 --> 21:55.402
Her blood is on your hands.

21:57.239 --> 22:00.006
What did you once say to me?

22:00.008 --> 22:02.976
I was taking control of the situation.

22:02.978 --> 22:05.178
She didn't deserve to die.

22:06.047 --> 22:07.380
You do.

22:09.284 --> 22:11.050
I don't believe you.

22:12.121 --> 22:13.319
Maybe you knew this woman,

22:13.321 --> 22:15.421
maybe your heart bleeds for her,

22:15.423 --> 22:17.924
but that is not why you're here.

22:17.926 --> 22:21.560
You are really here for another woman:

22:21.562 --> 22:24.097
Elena Michaels.

22:24.099 --> 22:27.000
Or should I say, Antonov.

22:27.002 --> 22:28.735
Did you think I wouldn't find out?

22:30.070 --> 22:31.504
You don't intimidate me, Roman.

22:31.506 --> 22:33.472
I don't care to intimidate you.

22:33.474 --> 22:36.108
I'm not like you. I'm not
going to make big speeches

22:36.110 --> 22:38.910
and try to teach a lesson.

22:38.912 --> 22:41.280
You are going to die today.

22:41.282 --> 22:42.714
And what do you want?

22:45.286 --> 22:49.087
A full confession.

22:49.089 --> 22:51.056
What am I confessing to?

22:51.058 --> 22:54.292
How you conspired with Sasha Antonov

22:54.294 --> 23:00.732
to lure me to North America to kill me,
to take control of the Russian territory.

23:04.971 --> 23:07.238
I don't think anyone's going
to believe that, Roman.

23:07.240 --> 23:10.575
Then you're going to
have to be convincing.

23:10.577 --> 23:13.178
You see what you did there?

23:13.180 --> 23:15.313
You opened with a request.

23:15.315 --> 23:17.114
That's a sign of weakness.

23:17.116 --> 23:19.416
See, you want me to implicate myself,

23:19.418 --> 23:22.653
so that you can justify
yourself to the Council

23:22.655 --> 23:24.321
after you kill me.

23:24.323 --> 23:26.323
Because you're afraid, aren't you?

23:26.325 --> 23:28.192
You showed me your throat.

23:29.562 --> 23:31.896
I didn't even have to raise a finger

23:31.898 --> 23:33.731
and already I'm in control.

23:35.634 --> 23:37.634
You're not a very good negotiator,

23:37.636 --> 23:38.702
are you, Roman?

23:38.704 --> 23:41.805
Who told you this was a negotiation?

23:45.944 --> 23:47.211
You will make a confession,

23:47.213 --> 23:48.478
you will do it with gusto,

23:48.480 --> 23:51.381
and then you will beg me to kill you.

23:51.383 --> 23:54.150
The louder the threat,
the weaker the action.

23:55.787 --> 23:58.188
Do you know what all great leaders have?

23:58.190 --> 24:00.023
It is what I have.

24:00.025 --> 24:03.226
A tactical advantage, a secret weapon.

24:03.228 --> 24:05.929
You have not met my
secret weapon, Danvers,

24:05.931 --> 24:08.331
and for that you should thank me.

24:08.333 --> 24:11.634
He is... unstoppable.

24:12.704 --> 24:16.205
Katia Antonov is already dead.

24:17.609 --> 24:20.376
Yes, my Albino is a perfect killer.

24:20.378 --> 24:22.878
I give him a name and they are dead,

24:22.880 --> 24:24.647
without question.

24:24.649 --> 24:29.051
The only ones who have managed
to slip away from him

24:29.053 --> 24:31.887
are the Antonovs.

24:31.889 --> 24:33.222
Until now.

24:35.793 --> 24:37.259
He drained that girl

24:37.261 --> 24:38.493
on the side of the road

24:38.495 --> 24:40.996
like a cow to slaughter

24:40.998 --> 24:43.398
while your Nick watched.

24:43.400 --> 24:44.966
You should be thankful I didn't think

24:44.968 --> 24:46.635
to add his name to the list.

24:49.273 --> 24:51.673
She was just an innocent girl.

24:51.675 --> 24:54.476
Bah! She connived,

24:54.478 --> 24:56.177
just like her father.

24:56.179 --> 24:57.679
Whose baby did she take?

24:57.681 --> 25:00.281
The baby werewolf with magical powers.

25:00.283 --> 25:01.949
It doesn't matter.

25:01.951 --> 25:03.251
The baby will be mine.

25:03.253 --> 25:05.119
As it should be. As the rule demands.

25:05.121 --> 25:06.954
I am not so squeamish as you are

25:06.956 --> 25:08.256
about killing humans.

25:08.258 --> 25:11.058
You're a madman, but not an Alpha.

25:11.060 --> 25:12.359
And the Council will see

25:12.361 --> 25:15.329
that you are a danger to our kind.

25:15.331 --> 25:16.930
N... no.

25:16.932 --> 25:18.332
When you make your confession,

25:18.334 --> 25:20.434
all they will think is that, uh...

25:20.436 --> 25:23.337
I was defending myself
against your aggression.

25:24.307 --> 25:26.407
I will give you nothing.

25:28.644 --> 25:30.577
Do you hear me?

25:30.579 --> 25:31.711
Nothing.

25:34.216 --> 25:35.816
We shall see.

25:46.461 --> 25:49.429
Sasha is mine...

25:49.431 --> 25:51.664
but once you've confessed,

25:51.666 --> 25:54.500
Elena will be taken off the list.

25:55.570 --> 25:57.804
You have one minute to decide.

26:17.609 --> 26:18.941
Sasha.

26:20.378 --> 26:22.578
Sasha, wake up.

26:55.679 --> 26:57.978
Sasha Antonov.

26:57.980 --> 27:00.047
This is my third notebook.

27:00.049 --> 27:02.116
You have been in all three.

27:03.953 --> 27:06.020
I congratulate you for
surviving this long.

27:06.022 --> 27:08.255
You have my respect.

27:10.860 --> 27:12.259
Let her go.

27:12.261 --> 27:13.260
Who, her?

27:13.262 --> 27:17.164
This is not possible.

27:17.166 --> 27:19.033
She would have been... tssssk!

27:19.035 --> 27:20.534
...finished many times already,

27:20.536 --> 27:23.337
but Navikev has a special
request for her.

27:23.339 --> 27:24.471
And for you.

27:26.542 --> 27:27.874
I don't take requests,

27:27.876 --> 27:30.844
but this one interests me:

27:30.846 --> 27:33.613
how to design this so it works.

27:33.615 --> 27:35.749
I enjoy the challenge.

27:40.121 --> 27:41.655
Ah, ah, ah!

27:41.657 --> 27:42.989
Not a good idea.

27:44.559 --> 27:46.425
This is very bad for you.

27:46.427 --> 27:47.760
Trust me on this, yes?

27:48.830 --> 27:51.397
Elena, are you okay?

27:51.399 --> 27:53.666
I'm fine.

27:53.668 --> 27:55.068
Yes. Very good.

27:55.070 --> 27:56.736
Everyone is okay.

27:56.738 --> 27:58.671
Now I will bring in a few more things,

27:58.673 --> 28:00.339
then we begin. Hmm?

28:18.692 --> 28:20.292
Jeremy!

28:20.294 --> 28:21.493
Are you okay?

28:21.495 --> 28:23.228
Nick, I have something to tell you.

28:23.230 --> 28:25.497
Please, don't interrupt me, just listen.

28:25.499 --> 28:27.900
Don't say anything until I'm done.

28:27.902 --> 28:30.235
O-okay.

28:30.237 --> 28:35.006
I first met with Sasha
Antonov over a year ago.

28:35.008 --> 28:36.974
That is when we first
came up with our plan

28:36.976 --> 28:39.176
to take over the Russian Pack.

28:39.178 --> 28:40.812
What are you talking about?

28:40.814 --> 28:42.380
Nick, listen.

28:42.382 --> 28:43.715
This was my idea

28:43.717 --> 28:45.683
and my idea alone.

28:45.685 --> 28:49.353
It's why I started to bring
more members into the Pack.

28:49.355 --> 28:51.122
It's why I sent Marsten

28:51.124 --> 28:52.924
to spy on the Russians.

28:52.926 --> 28:57.094
It is why I lured Roman
Navikev to Bear Valley...

28:57.096 --> 28:59.763
to kill him and install Sasha

28:59.765 --> 29:01.799
as the new Alpha in Russia.

29:01.801 --> 29:03.500
He was going to be our puppet.

29:03.502 --> 29:05.142
Jeremy, they can't get away with this...

29:05.167 --> 29:05.792
Nick...

29:06.104 --> 29:08.171
I need you to hear me and take note.

29:08.173 --> 29:09.873
Can you do that?

29:16.582 --> 29:19.917
Elena knew nothing of this.

29:19.919 --> 29:22.218
She was right to be suspicious of me,

29:22.220 --> 29:24.955
while I stitched it together.

29:24.957 --> 29:30.026
I did not want her pulling
at the threads of my plan.

29:30.028 --> 29:32.562
She was always right.

29:32.564 --> 29:34.264
I can see that now.

29:35.233 --> 29:36.899
Please tell her that.

29:38.236 --> 29:41.637
We lost so many loved ones, and friends.

29:41.639 --> 29:45.107
We were the cause of so much death.

29:45.109 --> 29:48.678
The bloodshed and the violence...

29:48.680 --> 29:51.647
I became addicted to that

29:51.649 --> 29:53.883
and I became a monster too.

29:55.219 --> 29:58.020
I finally became my father's son.

29:59.256 --> 30:01.890
And this is my fault.

30:01.892 --> 30:03.792
All of it.

30:03.794 --> 30:06.061
And it's my shame too.

30:08.466 --> 30:09.598
Elena.

30:12.202 --> 30:14.068
I can see her now.

30:18.074 --> 30:20.208
She gave us such a gift, Nick.

30:21.244 --> 30:22.711
When she came into our family,

30:22.713 --> 30:24.513
she made us all better men.

30:26.617 --> 30:28.383
She made us whole.

30:33.689 --> 30:35.323
I should've listened.

30:41.297 --> 30:44.432
Would you please tell her
that I am sorry for that.

30:50.172 --> 30:52.305
Nick, I love you all.

31:01.450 --> 31:03.783
Not perfect,

31:03.785 --> 31:05.685
but it will do.

31:14.029 --> 31:15.995
Well, they're all leaving.

31:15.997 --> 31:17.931
You sound disappointed.

31:17.933 --> 31:22.101
Well... I could've left my
ass-kicking boots at home.

31:27.075 --> 31:29.175
It was clever of you

31:29.177 --> 31:32.579
to ensure Elena is not to blame.

31:32.581 --> 31:34.580
You'll release her now?

31:34.582 --> 31:37.683
She is like a daughter to you.

31:37.685 --> 31:39.751
And for that alone,

31:39.753 --> 31:41.587
you have my envy.

31:45.993 --> 31:48.360
I was only close to my daughter

31:48.362 --> 31:51.029
was when I strangled her to death.

31:54.735 --> 31:56.468
I didn't have a chance to love her.

32:01.508 --> 32:03.141
Because of him.

32:11.251 --> 32:15.353
How are we to balance those scales?

32:15.355 --> 32:19.090
It is not enough to kill her, is it?

32:19.092 --> 32:20.958
Your word will mean nothing, Roman.

32:20.960 --> 32:23.394
Oh, don't appeal to honour now.

32:23.396 --> 32:24.929
It is too late for that.

32:24.931 --> 32:26.396
You murdered his daughter.

32:26.398 --> 32:28.198
The scales are balanced.

32:30.770 --> 32:32.703
No.

32:32.705 --> 32:34.505
Not in the least.

32:37.644 --> 32:39.176
Can you move anything?

32:40.046 --> 32:41.345
No.

32:41.347 --> 32:45.282
We have to do something
to get out of here.

32:45.284 --> 32:48.885
We are in the jaws of the red-eyed wolf.

32:48.887 --> 32:50.587
We won't get out.

32:52.525 --> 32:54.358
It doesn't mean that you stop.

32:59.998 --> 33:01.597
I love you, Elena.

33:06.872 --> 33:09.272
Did you know the
Nazis experimented with ways

33:09.274 --> 33:12.275
of killing quickly
without wasting bullets?

33:12.277 --> 33:14.177
They found that Phenol was the quickest.

33:21.018 --> 33:22.418
This is Phenol.

33:27.758 --> 33:29.525
No... no...

33:30.661 --> 33:32.961
- Open your fingers.
- Wh...

33:32.963 --> 33:35.998
Open, open, open. Sh-sh.

33:36.000 --> 33:38.801
Yeah? Now,

33:38.803 --> 33:40.402
you open the pliers

33:40.404 --> 33:42.237
and Phenol goes into her arm,

33:42.239 --> 33:45.273
and boom, instant unconscious.

33:45.275 --> 33:46.841
She is dead in one minute.

33:46.843 --> 33:49.211
Very painless, yes?

33:49.213 --> 33:50.612
I'm not going to kill my daughter.

33:50.614 --> 33:54.583
No. This is what Navikev wants.

33:54.585 --> 33:57.252
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah.

33:57.254 --> 33:59.120
Okay, okay, okay, I got... yeah...

34:09.232 --> 34:10.563
Roman.

34:11.768 --> 34:14.335
Roman, don't do this. Call him off.

34:15.205 --> 34:17.605
30 years.

34:17.607 --> 34:19.239
Every day,

34:19.242 --> 34:21.141
remembering how the light went out

34:21.143 --> 34:23.176
of my daughter's eyes.

34:24.313 --> 34:26.280
He will feel it.

34:27.583 --> 34:31.952
Every day of it in this moment.

34:31.954 --> 34:33.754
And so will you.

34:35.157 --> 34:36.889
It is curious to me:

34:36.891 --> 34:39.592
why only one woman werewolf?

34:39.594 --> 34:40.960
They said it was because

34:40.963 --> 34:42.661
women couldn't take the
pain of the Change,

34:42.664 --> 34:46.565
but this makes no sense to me.

34:46.568 --> 34:48.735
Women can take much more pain than men.

34:49.905 --> 34:54.039
Maybe this
is sexist attitude.

34:54.041 --> 34:56.376
- You think?
- I'm used to it.

34:56.378 --> 34:57.777
Ah, there, you see?

34:57.779 --> 34:59.279
Always, they put up with this.

34:59.281 --> 35:00.813
I don't know why.

35:05.987 --> 35:09.021
Shh.

35:09.023 --> 35:12.258
Stop, please, stop this now!

35:12.260 --> 35:13.926
Elena! No!

35:15.429 --> 35:17.629
You want to let go of the pliers?

35:19.033 --> 35:20.266
Never.

35:20.268 --> 35:22.268
Ah, don't say this.

35:24.272 --> 35:26.538
I wonder...

35:26.540 --> 35:30.375
if pain can kill you.

35:30.377 --> 35:32.678
Just pain. Nothing else.

35:38.552 --> 35:40.251
Ehh, no, no, no, no, no,

35:40.253 --> 35:42.486
no, no moving, no moving.

35:44.825 --> 35:48.559
Yeah.

35:51.131 --> 35:53.131
Yeah. That's very good.

35:53.133 --> 35:55.366
Yeah. So...

35:55.368 --> 35:56.734
now I think,

35:56.736 --> 35:59.470
"What is the worst pain? The most pain?

35:59.472 --> 36:00.805
"More than a man can take.

36:00.807 --> 36:02.973
Even more than a woman can take."

36:08.881 --> 36:10.348
Cautery wire.

36:10.350 --> 36:12.082
Burn, burn, burn.

36:12.084 --> 36:13.617
It's very hot.

36:16.088 --> 36:18.788
There. This wire is now

36:18.790 --> 36:21.090
where nerves connect to uterus,

36:21.092 --> 36:22.859
do you understand? Huh?

36:23.862 --> 36:28.497
This is where I control the heat.

36:28.499 --> 36:32.902
Hmm. I can make this 1000
times worse than childbirth.

36:35.073 --> 36:36.438
Back to my question.

36:38.308 --> 36:40.909
Can you die from pain,

36:40.911 --> 36:42.310
nothing else?

36:45.215 --> 36:47.616
Do we see how much pain to kill...

36:48.486 --> 36:50.486
or you let go of pliers?

36:52.790 --> 36:56.157
She can die very slowly

36:56.159 --> 36:58.159
or very fast.

36:58.161 --> 37:00.128
It's your choice.

37:00.130 --> 37:02.730
Roman, call him off. I'll
give you whatever you want!

37:02.732 --> 37:06.768
You are giving me everything
I want:

37:06.770 --> 37:09.971
an Alpha begging at my feet!

37:09.973 --> 37:11.506
Helpless.

37:16.379 --> 37:18.946
Are the pliers slippery?

37:18.948 --> 37:20.147
Just let go.

37:20.149 --> 37:21.649
Don't let go.

37:21.651 --> 37:23.584
Whatever happens, please don't let go.

37:23.586 --> 37:26.287
Elena, I can't let this happen.

37:26.289 --> 37:28.422
- I can't.
- Last chance.

37:28.424 --> 37:30.057
Please don't let go, okay?

37:30.059 --> 37:32.059
We'll get through this
together, you and me.

37:32.061 --> 37:34.194
Elena, I can't!

37:34.196 --> 37:35.662
I'm waiting to hold your hand.

37:54.883 --> 37:57.317
Where are the men? Get them in here!

38:03.224 --> 38:05.825
They are not coming.

38:05.827 --> 38:07.693
They are loyal to me now.

38:09.064 --> 38:10.396
My own son.

38:11.399 --> 38:13.632
You will die for this! Traitor!

38:18.739 --> 38:20.473
No one is here to help you, father.

38:20.475 --> 38:22.274
This is your fate,

38:22.276 --> 38:24.543
alone and unloved.

38:25.680 --> 38:28.246
I don't need your love.

38:28.248 --> 38:30.449
It is worthless.

39:23.569 --> 39:25.502
Magnificent.

39:43.922 --> 39:45.455
Ugh!

39:53.331 --> 39:54.664
Dad!

40:00.538 --> 40:02.471
Good!

40:02.473 --> 40:04.740
I can complete my list today.

40:05.643 --> 40:07.509
Tomorrow I find Clay Danvers.

40:08.479 --> 40:09.946
Well, he's right behind you.

40:28.832 --> 40:31.432
Alexei.

40:31.434 --> 40:32.801
Go get Elena.

40:58.328 --> 40:59.760
Hey, darlin'.

41:06.469 --> 41:08.141
Can you feel the
morphine kicking in?

41:17.014 --> 41:19.014
Will she be all right?

41:19.016 --> 41:22.583
You'll need some time to heal.

41:22.585 --> 41:25.453
Elena, you can't Change

41:25.455 --> 41:26.887
for a little while, okay?

41:26.889 --> 41:29.624
You'd risk tearing your uterine wall.

41:29.626 --> 41:31.792
The internal bleeding could kill you.

41:43.372 --> 41:45.572
You didn't let go.

41:45.574 --> 41:47.574
Neither did you.

41:50.345 --> 41:53.413
Let's get you back to Stonehaven.

41:53.415 --> 41:54.748
Jeremy?

41:56.585 --> 41:58.084
He'll meet us there.

41:59.154 --> 42:01.120
Roman's dead.

42:01.122 --> 42:02.255
It's over.

42:21.843 --> 42:24.010
The others should be here soon.

42:29.450 --> 42:31.483
Our Packs are bonded now.

42:31.485 --> 42:33.885
Everything is as it should be.

42:48.168 --> 42:51.169
My brothers...

42:51.171 --> 42:54.172
this is the man who killed your Alpha.

42:54.174 --> 42:57.109
Now we can exact our revenge.

43:45.757 --> 43:49.505
