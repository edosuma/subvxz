00:00.533 --> 00:02.501
<i>Previously on</i>
<i>when calls the heart...</i>

00:02.503 --> 00:04.503
I'm julie thatcher,
elizabeth's sister.

00:04.505 --> 00:05.938
I've got your
woman, mountie!

00:05.940 --> 00:07.239
[screams]

00:07.241 --> 00:08.307
Jack...

00:08.309 --> 00:10.009
That file is my property.

00:10.011 --> 00:11.510
You murdered
my son and my husband.

00:11.512 --> 00:13.012
[elizabeth]:
I can't be the person

00:13.014 --> 00:14.546
Who keeps you from
following your dreams.

00:14.548 --> 00:15.681
You have to go.

00:17.517 --> 00:20.052
"...And for his capture
of the tolliver gang,

00:20.054 --> 00:22.321
Jack thornton of
the northwest mounted police

00:22.323 --> 00:23.989
Is being hailed a hero..."

00:23.991 --> 00:25.124
[rip barks]

00:25.126 --> 00:26.258
[barking]

00:26.260 --> 00:27.860
[children laugh]

00:27.862 --> 00:28.927
[gabe]:
When mountie jack get back,

00:28.929 --> 00:30.963
Is he gonna be
courtshippin' you?

00:30.965 --> 00:33.065
"courtshipping"
is an improper use

00:33.067 --> 00:34.900
Of the verb "to court," gabe.

00:34.902 --> 00:36.168
And also an improper question.

00:36.170 --> 00:38.070
If he asks you out
to dinner again,

00:38.072 --> 00:39.938
Will that be
a proper question?

00:39.940 --> 00:41.240
[children giggling]

00:41.242 --> 00:42.408
You're blushing,
miss thatcher!

00:42.410 --> 00:44.009
[door opens]

00:47.380 --> 00:48.514
Excuse us for
interrupting, ma'am.

00:48.516 --> 00:51.450
The interruption
is greatly appreciated.

00:51.452 --> 00:52.951
You must be
the weaver boys.

00:52.953 --> 00:53.952
Yes, ma'am.

00:53.954 --> 00:55.554
Welcome to coal valley.

00:55.556 --> 00:57.256
Wyatt, ma'am.

00:57.258 --> 00:58.590
And I'm miss thatcher.

00:58.592 --> 00:59.625
We are very happy
to have you here.

00:59.627 --> 01:02.461
Please find
some seats.

01:02.463 --> 01:03.962
Find a seat.

01:05.565 --> 01:06.965
Wyatt,

01:06.967 --> 01:08.600
You don't have
to sit that far back.

01:08.602 --> 01:10.269
There's an empty seat by me!

01:10.271 --> 01:11.303
Thank you,

01:11.305 --> 01:12.504
But I'm just here
to watch my brothers

01:12.506 --> 01:14.573
On their first day.

01:14.575 --> 01:16.108
I finished school
three years ago.

01:16.110 --> 01:17.976
Oh. How old are you?

01:17.978 --> 01:19.411
16.

01:19.413 --> 01:20.612
There's always
something we can learn.

01:20.614 --> 01:23.082
Feel free to choose a book
from the library.

01:23.084 --> 01:26.251
Now, today

01:26.253 --> 01:28.087
We are going to be studying
thomas edison,

01:28.089 --> 01:30.956
One of the greatest minds
of our time.

01:30.958 --> 01:33.992
[starts gramophone]

01:33.994 --> 01:36.161
[recording plays]

01:36.163 --> 01:41.633
Introduced in 1877,
some 30 years ago.

01:41.635 --> 01:44.236
Do any of you know
how the phonograph works?

01:47.707 --> 01:50.409
[talking to himself]

01:51.478 --> 01:52.478
[recording stops playing]

01:52.480 --> 01:53.412
Wyatt?

01:54.681 --> 01:56.381
Was there something
you wanted to say?

01:57.617 --> 02:00.719
Well, ma'am,
in simple terms,

02:00.721 --> 02:03.122
As the disc rotates,
the needle vibrates

02:03.124 --> 02:05.390
To reproduce
the recorded sound.

02:05.392 --> 02:07.292
That's correct.

02:07.294 --> 02:09.595
Did you study edison
at your other school?

02:09.597 --> 02:11.096
No, I just like science.

02:11.098 --> 02:12.030
Well, clearly

02:12.032 --> 02:13.031
You have a gift for knowledge,

02:13.033 --> 02:14.733
And I hope you'll continue
to come to class.

02:14.735 --> 02:16.034
Thank you, ma'am,

02:16.036 --> 02:17.736
But I start work
in the mines tomorrow.

02:22.275 --> 02:25.344
[elizabeth]:
I hate that you're leaving.

02:25.346 --> 02:26.512
I feel as though

02:26.514 --> 02:28.547
I've brought quite enough
excitement to coal valley.

02:28.549 --> 02:30.215
But you'll be back?

02:30.217 --> 02:32.584
I promise.

02:32.586 --> 02:33.685
But for now,

02:33.687 --> 02:35.654
I am in need of
modern civilization

02:35.656 --> 02:37.656
And the comforts of home.

02:37.658 --> 02:39.057
Like a hot bath.

02:39.059 --> 02:40.459
Mother's hairdresser.

02:40.461 --> 02:41.460
And father's carriage.

02:41.462 --> 02:43.495
Oh, and a maid
to clean up after me.

02:43.497 --> 02:44.563
And indoor plumbing.

02:44.565 --> 02:46.064
Oh, especially that.

02:46.066 --> 02:48.267
[giggles]

02:48.269 --> 02:49.768
You sure you won't
come back with me?

02:50.770 --> 02:52.104
I'm sure.

02:53.273 --> 02:54.339
I had to ask.

02:55.775 --> 02:57.442
I know.

02:59.379 --> 03:04.349
And what if jack stays
in cape fullerton?

03:04.351 --> 03:07.085
Either way, I'll still be here.

03:16.763 --> 03:18.096
Whoa!

03:22.101 --> 03:23.202
I love you, sister.

03:23.204 --> 03:24.536
I love you too.

03:41.354 --> 03:43.689
Excuse me.

03:43.691 --> 03:45.591
This is coal valley?

03:45.593 --> 03:46.858
Yes, it is.

03:48.328 --> 03:50.662
Where's the rest of it?

03:50.664 --> 03:51.830
[chuckles]

03:51.832 --> 03:53.699
I'm afraid
you're looking at it.

03:53.701 --> 03:55.667
Oh.

03:55.669 --> 03:57.369
Well...

03:58.571 --> 03:59.771
Charming.

03:59.773 --> 04:01.473
It can be.

04:01.475 --> 04:04.309
I'm elizabeth thatcher.

04:04.311 --> 04:05.577
Rosemary leveaux.

04:05.579 --> 04:06.878
Pleasure to meet you,
miss leveaux.

04:18.324 --> 04:20.225
And what brings you here?

04:20.227 --> 04:21.493
My fiance.

04:21.495 --> 04:23.328
Congratulations.

04:23.330 --> 04:24.830
Perhaps I know him.

04:24.832 --> 04:26.331
Is he...

04:30.536 --> 04:31.737
One of the miners?

04:31.739 --> 04:33.639
[laughs] lord, no.

04:33.641 --> 04:35.507
Jack...

04:35.509 --> 04:37.442
Oh! There he is now!

04:37.444 --> 04:38.443
Jack!

04:44.450 --> 04:47.452
[â™ª]

04:55.662 --> 04:56.662
Oh...

05:02.201 --> 05:03.201
Jack!

05:03.203 --> 05:04.202
[laughing in delight]

05:04.204 --> 05:05.270
I'm here!

05:09.475 --> 05:10.776
Look at you.

05:10.778 --> 05:12.778
More handsome than ever.

05:12.780 --> 05:15.914
Uh... And you look awfully...

05:17.283 --> 05:18.750
Healthy.

05:18.752 --> 05:19.851
You've cut your hair,

05:19.853 --> 05:22.487
And I can see you've been
doing it yourself.

05:22.489 --> 05:23.789
Lucky for you
I brought my scissors.

05:23.791 --> 05:24.756
All right,

05:24.758 --> 05:26.158
Well, I'll let
you two catch up.

05:26.160 --> 05:27.225
No, elizabeth--

05:27.227 --> 05:29.161
Elizabeth, wait.

05:29.163 --> 05:30.729
Oh no.
Was it something I said?

05:32.765 --> 05:33.832
What are you doing here?

05:33.834 --> 05:35.767
I found out
where you were stationed,

05:35.769 --> 05:36.735
And I just had to see you.

05:36.737 --> 05:38.537
Well, I thought
you were in new york.

05:39.572 --> 05:42.307
It turns out, a life
in theater is quite empty

05:42.309 --> 05:43.408
Without you.

05:43.410 --> 05:46.378
That's not what you said
the last time we spoke.

05:46.380 --> 05:47.646
Dearest jack,

05:47.648 --> 05:48.747
I never should have
broken things off with you.

05:48.749 --> 05:49.748
But you did.

05:49.750 --> 05:51.850
And I have regretted it
every day since.

05:51.852 --> 05:53.752
But I'm here now.

05:53.754 --> 05:56.922
Rosemary, you cannot expect
that after two years

05:56.924 --> 05:57.923
Things would stay the same.

05:57.925 --> 06:00.359
Two years, two hours...

06:00.361 --> 06:02.561
Two minutes?

06:05.965 --> 06:07.299
It's just time.

06:10.603 --> 06:11.670
It's a lifetime.

06:13.940 --> 06:16.341
Certainly...

06:16.343 --> 06:18.343
Some living
has happened since then.

06:20.346 --> 06:23.415
But my feelings
haven't changed.

06:23.417 --> 06:24.416
And if yours have...

06:28.554 --> 06:30.389
Well, then, I'm just going
to have to do whatever it takes

06:30.391 --> 06:31.690
To win them back.

06:34.761 --> 06:36.995
I can't believe it.

06:36.997 --> 06:39.498
How could he not tell me
he was engaged?

06:39.500 --> 06:41.700
I admit I'm as
surprised as you.

06:41.702 --> 06:43.301
I didn't know
what to say.

06:43.303 --> 06:46.938
Jack's been off taking
the tolliver gang to justice,

06:46.940 --> 06:48.607
And then she arrives,

06:48.609 --> 06:50.876
And he arrives, and...

06:50.878 --> 06:53.278
The way she jumped
into his arms,

06:53.280 --> 06:55.514
It was as though
they were already married.

06:55.516 --> 06:56.915
Jack has always
been honorable.

06:56.917 --> 07:01.319
Perhaps things
aren't as they seem.

07:01.321 --> 07:02.754
She's not even
that pretty.

07:02.756 --> 07:04.823
Yes, she is.

07:04.825 --> 07:06.458
I've seen prettier.

07:06.460 --> 07:09.995
You're a good friend,
but a bad liar.

07:09.997 --> 07:12.264
Would a hot biscuit
make you feel better?

07:12.266 --> 07:13.098
No...

07:15.368 --> 07:16.701
But ten might.

07:16.703 --> 07:17.869
[chuckles]

07:17.871 --> 07:20.272
All right,
abigail,

07:20.274 --> 07:23.041
I'll just be
in my room.

07:23.043 --> 07:23.942
Eating.

07:23.944 --> 07:25.544
And if jack should
come calling,

07:25.546 --> 07:27.546
As I know he will?

07:27.548 --> 07:28.613
You tell him

07:28.615 --> 07:31.783
I don't wish
to be disturbed.

07:31.785 --> 07:33.418
[sighs]

07:38.291 --> 07:40.425
Constable, what
can I do for you?

07:40.427 --> 07:42.027
Tom, this is
miss rosemary leveaux.

07:42.029 --> 07:44.696
She'll be needing
a room for one night.

07:44.698 --> 07:46.398
What mr. Thornton
means to say

07:46.400 --> 07:47.632
Is that
I'll be staying here

07:47.634 --> 07:48.934
Until I find
more permanent quarters,

07:48.936 --> 07:52.771
Which could be many nights.

07:52.773 --> 07:54.473
Uh, well, there's a room
at the end of the hall,

07:54.475 --> 07:56.808
But you might find it
a bit noisy

07:56.810 --> 07:58.510
What with the new
miners moved in--

07:58.512 --> 07:59.744
Noise doesn't bother me.

07:59.746 --> 08:01.313
In fact, I relish it.

08:01.315 --> 08:02.714
Well, if it's noise
you're looking for,

08:02.716 --> 08:04.349
I'm certain coal valley
will be a disappointment.

08:04.351 --> 08:05.951
How could it be?
You're here.

08:05.953 --> 08:06.952
Room 9.

08:06.954 --> 08:08.587
Thank you.

08:08.589 --> 08:09.654
Jack, could you
show me to my room?

08:09.656 --> 08:11.623
Oh, you'll find it.
It's right next to room 8.

08:11.625 --> 08:12.491
Are you in room 8?

08:12.493 --> 08:13.391
I sleep in the jail.

08:13.393 --> 08:14.759
Oh, how tragic.

08:14.761 --> 08:15.760
Actually,
it's quite comfortable.

08:15.762 --> 08:17.562
-But lonely.
-I have a dog.

08:19.398 --> 08:20.866
[chuckles awkwardly]

08:38.518 --> 08:39.484
Inspector avery,

08:39.486 --> 08:41.086
You made it.

08:41.088 --> 08:42.387
Did you think I wouldn't?

08:42.389 --> 08:44.155
Not for a minute.

08:44.957 --> 08:45.991
It's been a long time.

08:45.993 --> 08:47.692
Yes, it has, jack.

08:47.694 --> 08:48.760
Since the academy, I believe.

08:48.762 --> 08:49.761
You had the red coat then,

08:49.763 --> 08:52.831
But not the badge yet.

08:52.833 --> 08:55.834
Jack, I've been riding
for quite a while.

08:55.836 --> 08:57.969
Is there a place nearby
I can get a decent meal?

08:57.971 --> 08:59.437
Funny you should
say that.

08:59.439 --> 09:01.072
Abigail stanton's cafe.

09:10.383 --> 09:11.850
Can I help you?

09:11.852 --> 09:13.451
I hope so.

09:13.453 --> 09:16.054
Yes. Do we
know each other?

09:16.056 --> 09:17.522
I'm bill avery.

09:17.524 --> 09:19.758
I'm in from capital city
at jack thornton's behest.

09:19.760 --> 09:20.892
That's a
long ride in.

09:20.894 --> 09:23.094
My food is good.
I'm not sure it's that good.

09:23.096 --> 09:25.530
I look forward to trying
everything on your menu.

09:25.532 --> 09:26.831
Please, have a seat.

09:26.833 --> 09:29.134
As long as it's not on a horse,
I don't mind if I do.

09:29.136 --> 09:30.969
[chuckles] coffee?

09:30.971 --> 09:31.970
Please.

09:31.972 --> 09:33.004
How do you know jack?

09:33.006 --> 09:34.873
From his days at the academy.

09:34.875 --> 09:37.442
So you're a mountie?

09:37.444 --> 09:38.777
I'm an inspector.

09:38.779 --> 09:40.779
I'm a forensic
investigator.

09:40.781 --> 09:44.149
Jack wired me about the file
that you found.

09:44.151 --> 09:47.118
And may I say I'm very sorry
for your terrible loss. Thank

09:47.120 --> 09:49.087
You.

09:49.089 --> 09:51.423
Mrs. Stanton,

09:51.425 --> 09:52.524
I'm here to build a case

09:52.526 --> 09:54.125
Against the pacific northwest
mining company

09:54.127 --> 09:56.595
For the unsafe conditions

09:56.597 --> 09:58.563
That led to the tragic death
of 46 men,

09:58.565 --> 10:00.599
Including your husband and son.

10:03.803 --> 10:05.503
You have no idea
how long I've waited

10:05.505 --> 10:06.671
To hear somebody say that.

10:06.673 --> 10:08.773
Since the day
of the disaster, I'd imagine.

10:08.775 --> 10:10.642
And every day since then.

10:11.611 --> 10:12.711
Will you help me, then?

10:12.713 --> 10:14.646
I will.

10:18.484 --> 10:21.953
[a piano plays]

10:36.869 --> 10:38.069
[song ends]

10:38.071 --> 10:41.906
[applause]

10:45.878 --> 10:46.878
Elizabeth,

10:46.880 --> 10:49.581
I don't know
if you can hear me, but...

10:51.250 --> 10:52.951
Please let me explain!

10:52.953 --> 10:55.920
Jack!

10:55.922 --> 10:58.590
You mounties sure
put in long hours.

10:58.592 --> 11:00.191
Well, I...

11:00.193 --> 11:01.559
I'm off duty.

11:01.561 --> 11:02.961
You know who's
not off duty?

11:02.963 --> 11:05.897
The barkeep at the saloon.

11:05.899 --> 11:07.632
Uh...

11:07.634 --> 11:10.168
[closes window sharply]

11:10.170 --> 11:12.537
Walk me back, then.

11:12.539 --> 11:14.639
[giggles]

11:23.616 --> 11:25.083
[door opens]

11:34.627 --> 11:37.228
I think it is safer
in here with you

11:37.230 --> 11:39.297
Than out there, buddy.

11:42.768 --> 11:44.135
[sighs]

12:12.998 --> 12:15.233
This is where
the blast originated.

12:15.235 --> 12:16.735
The company said
they boarded up the shaft

12:16.737 --> 12:18.103
For safety reasons.

12:19.105 --> 12:21.906
Well, that's convenient.

12:22.842 --> 12:24.008
I must say,
constable,

12:24.010 --> 12:26.177
I never pictured you
in a town like this.

12:26.179 --> 12:27.245
Me either.

12:28.314 --> 12:30.348
The place kind of
grows on you.

12:30.350 --> 12:31.282
The people,

12:31.284 --> 12:34.018
They're special.

12:54.807 --> 12:58.076
I'll be back
after my rounds.

13:13.159 --> 13:15.326
Go get gowen.

13:23.903 --> 13:25.637
[gowen]: This is
a restricted area.

13:25.639 --> 13:26.905
I will assume
that you are a gentleman

13:26.907 --> 13:30.842
And ask you to leave.

13:32.411 --> 13:35.146
Well, I do appreciate the word
"gentleman," mr. Gowen.

13:35.148 --> 13:37.715
I don't hear it very often
in my line of work.

13:39.718 --> 13:41.319
Bill avery.

13:41.321 --> 13:42.654
I'm here to investigate

13:42.656 --> 13:44.155
The explosion
that happened in your mine.

13:49.094 --> 13:50.195
By whose order?

13:52.798 --> 13:57.969
The forensic division of
the northwest mounted police.

13:57.971 --> 13:59.737
It's a little late to be
investigating a disaster

13:59.739 --> 14:01.773
That happened
over six months ago, isn't it?

14:01.775 --> 14:04.008
Well...

14:04.010 --> 14:06.845
46 men are still dead,
aren't they?

14:08.314 --> 14:10.181
Yes, they are.

14:10.183 --> 14:11.883
If I can be of any assistance,

14:11.885 --> 14:13.318
Please feel free
to call upon me.

14:13.320 --> 14:15.019
You can be assured I will.

14:16.121 --> 14:17.222
Good afternoon.

14:42.114 --> 14:44.182
You can't
avoid me forever.

14:44.184 --> 14:45.183
No.

14:45.185 --> 14:47.385
Just until you finally
take your new posting

14:47.387 --> 14:48.419
At cape fullerton.

14:48.421 --> 14:49.487
I'm not going
to cape fullerton.

14:51.056 --> 14:53.191
Patrick o'reilly has
taken the post there.

14:53.193 --> 14:55.860
His family is joining him.

14:55.862 --> 14:58.296
I'm staying here
in coal valley.

14:58.298 --> 15:01.099
This is where
I belong.

15:02.768 --> 15:04.502
That's an interesting
lesson.

15:04.504 --> 15:06.971
And valuable.

15:06.973 --> 15:09.307
Excuse me, I missed one.

15:14.346 --> 15:15.346
"perfidy."

15:15.348 --> 15:17.215
I don't even want to know
what that one is.

15:17.217 --> 15:18.950
No, you don't.

15:18.952 --> 15:20.385
And school is
about to begin, so...

15:20.387 --> 15:21.819
So I'll speak fast.

15:21.821 --> 15:24.255
I was engaged, once,

15:24.257 --> 15:26.457
But from where I stand,
that seems like another life.

15:26.459 --> 15:29.093
So much has changed
since then.

15:29.095 --> 15:30.128
I've changed.

15:30.130 --> 15:32.397
And part of the reason
I've changed is you.

15:32.399 --> 15:34.499
Yet in all our conversations,

15:34.501 --> 15:37.869
You failed to mention
your fiancee even once.

15:37.871 --> 15:39.270
Former fiancee.

15:39.272 --> 15:41.973
I should have told you.

15:41.975 --> 15:43.508
I...

15:43.510 --> 15:45.877
I guess I just didn't want
to open an old wound.

15:45.879 --> 15:48.980
So she wounded you,
not the other way around?

15:52.284 --> 15:53.551
[gasps]

15:53.553 --> 15:54.786
I didn't ask her to come here.

15:54.788 --> 15:55.887
Yet here she is.

15:55.889 --> 15:57.455
Only until she realizes
there's no point to it.

15:57.457 --> 15:59.157
She didn't seem
to realize that last night,

15:59.159 --> 16:00.258
Nor did you.

16:00.260 --> 16:01.926
You mean when you slammed
your window shut?

16:03.295 --> 16:04.295
I was cold.

16:04.297 --> 16:05.863
And getting colder, I sense.

16:07.333 --> 16:09.567
I just can't help but think
what else you haven't told me.

16:09.569 --> 16:10.802
Well, aren't there things
in your life

16:10.804 --> 16:13.137
That you haven't told me?

16:13.139 --> 16:14.505
I'm certain my life
is far less dramatic.

16:18.477 --> 16:19.544
Elizabeth...

16:21.880 --> 16:25.917
I know you've lost
some faith in me,

16:25.919 --> 16:27.418
But I hope, over time,

16:27.420 --> 16:29.153
You're going to see
that my heart is true.

16:29.989 --> 16:31.422
[children open the door,
talking]

16:31.424 --> 16:32.657
Good morning, children.

16:36.829 --> 16:38.029
"perfidy?"

16:38.964 --> 16:39.998
Look it up.

16:45.137 --> 16:46.104
Hi, wyatt.

16:46.106 --> 16:47.071
-Hi.
-It's gem.

16:47.073 --> 16:48.272
I remember.

16:48.274 --> 16:49.374
You do?

16:49.376 --> 16:50.475
A gem is
a rare stone,

16:50.477 --> 16:52.143
Not easily forgettable.

16:54.913 --> 16:56.047
First day at the mine?

16:56.049 --> 16:57.982
First of many, ma'am.

16:59.051 --> 17:01.019
All right, children,
take your seats.

17:01.021 --> 17:02.954
I'm not a child,
miss thatcher.

17:02.956 --> 17:05.156
Of course you're not.

17:05.158 --> 17:06.424
My apologies, gem.

17:06.426 --> 17:07.592
I must remember

17:07.594 --> 17:10.294
That some of you will be
going off into the world soon.

17:10.296 --> 17:13.164
And some to the mine.

17:13.166 --> 17:15.199
For you. On loan.

17:15.201 --> 17:17.168
College books
from my collection.

17:17.170 --> 17:19.137
Thank you, ma'am.
I look forward to reading them.

17:19.139 --> 17:21.305
When you're finished,
I have more.

17:30.115 --> 17:32.250
Here, here...
Watch your step there.

17:35.954 --> 17:38.990
All right.

17:38.992 --> 17:41.125
Have a nice day, now.

17:46.331 --> 17:49.367
You reminded me
of my late husband out there.

17:49.369 --> 17:51.436
He could never pass up
the opportunity

17:51.438 --> 17:53.571
To lend a hand.

17:53.573 --> 17:55.139
I heard he was
a good man.

17:56.108 --> 17:57.608
He was.

17:57.610 --> 17:58.976
To have lost him
and your son,

17:58.978 --> 18:01.479
It's... Unspeakable.

18:01.481 --> 18:02.680
[sighs]

18:02.682 --> 18:05.550
And yet
I speak of it so often...

18:05.552 --> 18:07.585
To keep them alive somehow,
I suppose.

18:07.587 --> 18:09.253
They'll always be alive
in your memories.

18:09.255 --> 18:13.324
Though I know
that's of little comfort.

18:13.326 --> 18:15.293
Have you
a wife and children?

18:15.295 --> 18:17.595
No.

18:17.597 --> 18:19.931
But the life you lead
must be so fulfilling.

18:19.933 --> 18:23.668
Though I do wish I had someone
to share my thoughts with.

18:24.536 --> 18:25.603
I spend most
of my time alone,

18:25.605 --> 18:27.038
Or with strangers.

18:27.040 --> 18:30.208
That's why it's nice working
with jack again. And you.

18:31.343 --> 18:33.377
This case.

18:33.379 --> 18:35.480
I'm afraid we've done
more talking than working.

18:35.482 --> 18:37.515
I hadn't noticed.

18:39.618 --> 18:43.387
More tea, mr. Avery?

18:43.389 --> 18:45.123
It's bill.

18:45.125 --> 18:47.158
And I hope
I can call you abigail.

18:49.328 --> 18:51.729
I'm afraid I might have
given you the wrong impression.

18:51.731 --> 18:54.098
And what impression
might that be?

18:55.534 --> 18:57.735
I don't usually speak of
such personal matters

18:57.737 --> 18:58.736
With strangers.

18:58.738 --> 19:00.705
I see.

19:00.707 --> 19:03.474
That is entirely
my fault.

19:03.476 --> 19:06.177
It's part of my job
to get people to talk.

19:06.179 --> 19:07.044
It's...

19:07.046 --> 19:08.379
It's like I'm a--

19:08.381 --> 19:09.747
Ventriloquist?

19:09.749 --> 19:11.149
[chuckling] no.

19:11.151 --> 19:12.450
That would mean I was trying
to put words in your mouth,

19:12.452 --> 19:13.451
I think.

19:15.287 --> 19:17.155
We want the same thing,

19:17.157 --> 19:19.123
Justice for your family,

19:19.125 --> 19:20.558
And the people
that have suffered.

19:20.560 --> 19:22.059
And I mean to get you
that justice.

19:23.428 --> 19:25.062
Then you may call me abigail.

19:25.064 --> 19:26.330
Then...

19:26.332 --> 19:27.765
May I have more pie, abigail?

19:27.767 --> 19:30.434
Yes, you may.

19:55.594 --> 19:56.460
I think this might
interest you

19:56.462 --> 19:58.563
More than the pie.

20:00.632 --> 20:04.135
After we spoke, I went through
noah's personal effects.

20:04.137 --> 20:06.270
I found that
in one of his pockets.

20:06.272 --> 20:09.307
This is a journal

20:09.309 --> 20:10.741
Of methane and oxygen levels.

20:10.743 --> 20:12.276
I assumed as much.

20:12.278 --> 20:13.411
I just don't know
why he had it.

20:13.413 --> 20:14.812
I think I do.

20:14.814 --> 20:16.647
Thank you

20:16.649 --> 20:18.182
For trusting me with this.

20:19.251 --> 20:21.652
I only hope I haven't
implicated noah in some way.

20:21.654 --> 20:24.155
I hope so too.

20:25.724 --> 20:26.824
Well, if you'll excuse me,

20:26.826 --> 20:28.793
I have to deliver
a welcome basket to mrs. Weaver.

20:28.795 --> 20:30.194
A welcome basket?

20:30.196 --> 20:31.696
Oh, yes, she's new to town.

20:31.698 --> 20:33.331
I remember how lonely
that can be.

20:33.333 --> 20:35.399
Perhaps I can walk with you.

20:36.335 --> 20:38.402
I'm sure you have
more important things to do.

20:38.404 --> 20:39.737
It can wait.

20:42.241 --> 20:44.909
[talking quietly]

20:46.545 --> 20:49.080
She's working
with that investigator

20:49.082 --> 20:50.481
To build a case against us.

20:50.483 --> 20:51.449
What do you know
about him?

20:51.451 --> 20:54.752
He had the richmond mine
closed last year.

20:54.754 --> 20:58.456
I won't let that happen here.

20:58.458 --> 21:02.360
We've got to stop this
before they dig any deeper.

21:03.729 --> 21:06.664
Send this telegram
to head office.

21:08.333 --> 21:10.534
I'm going to have them send
their best lawyer.

21:10.536 --> 21:12.603
Sounds like trouble,
mr. Gowen.

21:12.605 --> 21:14.538
Oh, we're way past trouble.

21:14.540 --> 21:17.241
This is war.

21:19.478 --> 21:21.379
Are these all that came in?

21:21.381 --> 21:22.780
I'm afraid so,
mrs. Ramsey.

21:22.782 --> 21:23.781
Hmm...

21:30.155 --> 21:31.222
I'd go with the red.

21:31.224 --> 21:33.424
It compliments
your hair.

21:33.426 --> 21:34.959
Oh. My thoughts exactly.

21:36.328 --> 21:37.328
Rosemary leveaux.

21:37.330 --> 21:39.330
Dottie ramsey.

21:39.332 --> 21:42.300
Are you a seamstress,
miss leveaux?

21:42.302 --> 21:43.501
Oh, no,
I'm an actress.

21:43.503 --> 21:45.336
Although I have sewn
my own costumes

21:45.338 --> 21:47.271
On occasion.

21:47.273 --> 21:51.175
My husband and I
absolutely adore the theater.

21:51.177 --> 21:52.910
You won't believe this,

21:52.912 --> 21:54.745
But I've always dreamed
of acting.

21:54.747 --> 21:56.714
Oh, of course I believe it!

21:56.716 --> 21:58.215
Who wouldn't want to be
someone else,

21:58.217 --> 21:59.717
If only for an hour or two?

21:59.719 --> 22:01.719
So true.

22:11.630 --> 22:14.198
And so I took a bow...

22:14.200 --> 22:15.933
And I ran off the stage,

22:15.935 --> 22:17.668
Just as the curtain
fell from the rafters!

22:17.670 --> 22:19.170
[laughing]

22:19.172 --> 22:21.305
That was my very first
"curtain call" in new york.

22:21.307 --> 22:22.540
But not my last.

22:22.542 --> 22:24.175
Miss thatcher,

22:24.177 --> 22:27.278
Have you met the charming
rosemary leveaux?

22:27.280 --> 22:28.913
I've had the pleasure.

22:28.915 --> 22:30.915
Miss thatcher and I
share a common interest.

22:30.917 --> 22:32.717
He looks good in red also.

22:32.719 --> 22:34.652
Oh my.

22:34.654 --> 22:36.887
Are you talking
about the constable?

22:36.889 --> 22:37.922
Are we,
miss thatcher?

22:39.191 --> 22:41.292
I believe you're the only
one speaking, miss leveaux.

22:42.294 --> 22:43.627
[chuckles]
you're so right.

22:44.830 --> 22:47.298
I do seem
to have a lot to say.

22:47.300 --> 22:48.833
Oh, and it's so entertaining.

22:48.835 --> 22:49.967
I simply can't believe

22:49.969 --> 22:52.236
You're not married yet,
rosemary.

22:52.238 --> 22:54.572
Well, I do hope
to change that,

22:54.574 --> 22:55.840
Sooner rather than later.

22:55.842 --> 22:57.608
Forgive me.

22:57.610 --> 23:00.845
I shouldn't be talking
about this in front of you.

23:00.847 --> 23:03.681
Feel free to say whatever
you wish in front of me.

23:03.683 --> 23:04.915
Likewise.

23:04.917 --> 23:07.551
Or behind my back,
if you prefer.

23:07.553 --> 23:08.652
[giggles]
as an actress,

23:08.654 --> 23:10.221
I'm used to both.

23:10.223 --> 23:11.789
Oh, how could that
be possible?

23:11.791 --> 23:12.790
Thank you, dottie.

23:12.792 --> 23:13.858
Miss thatcher!

23:14.693 --> 23:16.694
How well do you
know our jack?

23:17.729 --> 23:19.296
Not as well I thought.

23:19.298 --> 23:20.631
We've known
each other forever,

23:20.633 --> 23:21.999
Just about.

23:22.001 --> 23:23.634
Our fathers were
mounties together.

23:23.636 --> 23:24.835
How fortuitous.

23:24.837 --> 23:25.970
Yes.

23:25.972 --> 23:29.273
Although jack didn't always
want to be a mountie.

23:29.275 --> 23:30.441
He wanted to be a painter.

23:30.443 --> 23:31.409
Jack?

23:32.411 --> 23:33.310
A painter?

23:33.312 --> 23:34.311
Yes.

23:35.347 --> 23:36.881
Of course, you've only
known each other

23:36.883 --> 23:37.982
A short while.

23:41.586 --> 23:42.653
Excuse me.

23:43.889 --> 23:45.956
Hmm, pencils, soap, string.

23:45.958 --> 23:47.691
My, you have
a busy day planned.

23:47.693 --> 23:48.926
Yes.

23:48.928 --> 23:51.262
Are you hungry, rosemary?

23:51.264 --> 23:52.563
Oh! I could eat a horse.

23:52.565 --> 23:54.432
Although that wouldn't be
very ladylike, would it?

23:54.434 --> 23:55.466
[chuckles]

23:55.468 --> 23:57.334
Then you will come with me
to the cafe.

23:57.336 --> 23:58.803
How wonderful.

24:06.344 --> 24:07.878
She's awfully pretty.

24:07.880 --> 24:10.347
Yeah.

24:10.349 --> 24:11.482
[clears throat]

24:13.285 --> 24:14.051
[clears throat awkwardly]

24:14.053 --> 24:16.053
Now, what was on
that list again,

24:16.055 --> 24:16.954
Miss thatcher?

24:16.956 --> 24:18.322
Pencils,
soap, and....

24:18.324 --> 24:19.356
String.

24:19.358 --> 24:22.660
Oh, I almost forgot.

24:23.662 --> 24:24.728
You got a letter.

24:25.530 --> 24:26.797
Thank you.

24:28.567 --> 24:30.334
<i>[elizabeth's father writes]:</i>
<i>"dear beth,</i>

24:30.336 --> 24:32.736
<i>Your mother and I can't help</i>
<i>but fear for your safety.</i>

24:32.738 --> 24:35.439
<i>Of your harrowing ordeal</i>
<i>with the outlaws,</i>

24:35.441 --> 24:37.875
<i>And I'm afraid it's all</i>
<i>too much for us to bear.</i>

24:37.877 --> 24:40.945
<i>Which makes my good news</i>
<i>all the more heartening.</i>

24:40.947 --> 24:42.947
<i>Briarcliff prep academy</i>

<i>Has offered you a prestigious</i>

<i>You would be the first woman</i>

25:03.368 --> 25:04.869
Miss thatcher...

25:04.871 --> 25:06.871
Hello, wyatt.

25:08.573 --> 25:10.040
Thank you.

25:10.042 --> 25:11.375
I found them
very interesting.

25:11.377 --> 25:14.678
Especially the one
on physical engineering.

25:14.680 --> 25:16.614
You read them both?
Already?

25:18.016 --> 25:20.684
Oh my, I must say,
I am more than impressed.

25:20.686 --> 25:21.752
Your folks must be very proud.

25:21.754 --> 25:23.120
It's just my mother.

25:23.122 --> 25:24.722
Pa left us.

25:24.724 --> 25:26.957
I'm so sorry.
My sympathies.

25:26.959 --> 25:28.592
Oh, he didn't die, ma'am.

25:29.661 --> 25:30.995
He abandoned us.

25:32.764 --> 25:34.064
Oh.

25:34.066 --> 25:35.933
We get by.

25:35.935 --> 25:38.502
But we don't talk much
about books at home.

25:38.504 --> 25:40.104
I mostly read in private.

25:40.106 --> 25:41.872
Why is that?

25:41.874 --> 25:43.841
Surely your mother
approves of reading.

25:43.843 --> 25:45.376
We all work really hard.

25:45.378 --> 25:46.544
There just
doesn't seem to be time

25:46.546 --> 25:49.046
For much else.

25:49.048 --> 25:51.015
I see.

25:51.017 --> 25:52.883
Well, then, I will just have
to sort through my library

25:52.885 --> 25:54.518
And see what else
you might like.

25:58.123 --> 26:00.558
Thank you, miss thatcher.

26:03.028 --> 26:05.062
Is that the boy
you were telling me about?

26:05.064 --> 26:06.830
He read two
university level books

26:06.832 --> 26:07.898
In as many nights,

26:07.900 --> 26:08.933
Including the one

26:08.935 --> 26:10.768
I couldn't get
through myself.

26:10.770 --> 26:12.903
The mine swallows
another one.

26:12.905 --> 26:14.772
Not if I can help it.

26:16.675 --> 26:19.510
[laughter]

26:19.512 --> 26:22.479
-Oh, no...
-Just give me that.

26:22.481 --> 26:24.114
Let's get some coffee.

26:24.116 --> 26:27.017
Do you have
anything stronger?

26:29.054 --> 26:30.955
Apparently, she can shoot,

26:30.957 --> 26:32.790
Fish, recite shakespeare,

26:32.792 --> 26:36.160
Sing,
play two instruments...

26:36.162 --> 26:38.462
Oh, and shine shoes.

26:38.464 --> 26:39.997
Is there anything she can't do?

26:39.999 --> 26:42.032
Her juggling
could use some work.

26:42.034 --> 26:44.234
She bruised
half the apples in my cafe.

26:46.037 --> 26:47.137
That's not all she bruised.

26:48.440 --> 26:50.107
The truth is,
I'm ashamed of my jealousy.

26:50.109 --> 26:51.842
But...

26:51.844 --> 26:53.944
She takes over
every room she's in.

26:53.946 --> 26:57.615
She's a shiny new object.
She'll tarnish.

26:57.617 --> 26:59.183
That could take a long time.

26:59.185 --> 27:01.518
Or not.

27:01.520 --> 27:06.056
Elizabeth, her qualities
could blow away in the wind.

27:06.058 --> 27:08.926
Yours are steadfast.

27:08.928 --> 27:11.562
You're good-hearted
and loyal...

27:11.564 --> 27:12.663
Like a dog.

27:14.232 --> 27:16.834
Or a boring schoolteacher
who buys pencils and string.

27:16.836 --> 27:19.803
I doubt jack would agree.

27:19.805 --> 27:21.672
And besides,
he left her.

27:21.674 --> 27:24.308
Actually, she left him.

27:26.044 --> 27:27.544
Oh.

27:28.880 --> 27:29.913
I think that's

27:29.915 --> 27:32.249
What has me so shaken.

27:32.251 --> 27:35.119
The knowledge
that she broke his heart.

27:35.121 --> 27:37.655
And if she could
do that once,

27:37.657 --> 27:39.890
Couldn't she
win it back again?

27:39.892 --> 27:42.793
What does jack say?

27:42.795 --> 27:45.663
That it's all in the past.

27:45.665 --> 27:48.032
But somehow they look
very much in the present.

27:48.967 --> 27:51.068
Elizabeth,
he did come back for you.

27:51.070 --> 27:55.105
He did decide against
cape fullerton.

27:55.107 --> 27:56.840
And now that he's
staying in coal valley,

27:56.842 --> 28:01.045
You'll have a chance
to rebuild your trust.

28:05.917 --> 28:07.184
Elizabeth,
what is it?

28:07.186 --> 28:10.087
I received
a letter from home.

28:10.089 --> 28:12.256
It seems my family

28:12.258 --> 28:14.625
Has procured a teaching
position for me

28:14.627 --> 28:16.593
At a prestigious
prep school back home.

28:16.595 --> 28:19.797
I'd be the first woman
ever to teach there.

28:21.032 --> 28:22.966
I see.

28:25.203 --> 28:27.237
Will you take it?

28:27.239 --> 28:30.207
A few days ago,
I would have said no.

28:30.209 --> 28:32.342
And now?

28:34.045 --> 28:35.312
I'm a little less certain.

28:39.584 --> 28:43.821
Is it possible I misread
my calling in coming here?

28:44.989 --> 28:46.990
I can only tell you
to follow your heart.

28:46.992 --> 28:49.226
It was my heart
that led me to coal valley.

28:49.228 --> 28:51.128
Well then, I hope
it keeps you here.

29:12.818 --> 29:15.085
<i>[cat montgomery]:</i>
<i>So, perhaps one day,</i>

29:15.087 --> 29:18.088
We'll be back
in a real church again,

29:18.090 --> 29:20.891
But until then,

29:20.893 --> 29:25.062
God is with us...
Right here.

29:26.197 --> 29:27.164
Thank you all.

29:27.166 --> 29:29.199
Have a wonderful week,
and god bless you.

29:33.772 --> 29:35.305
All the women in town
seem to be wearing red.

29:35.307 --> 29:37.775
Well, it appears
you've started a trend.

29:38.943 --> 29:40.677
How flattering.

29:43.314 --> 29:44.848
Pardon the
interruption, folks.

29:44.850 --> 29:46.350
No intrusion.

29:46.352 --> 29:48.252
We were just finishing.

29:48.254 --> 29:49.787
Can I help you, mountie?

29:49.789 --> 29:50.854
Jack thornton?

29:50.856 --> 29:51.789
Yes, sir.

29:51.791 --> 29:52.990
On behalf of
the governor general,

29:52.992 --> 29:54.224
I have here a commendation

29:54.226 --> 29:55.659
For the capture
of the tolliver gang,

29:55.661 --> 29:57.227
And a reward
for your service

29:57.229 --> 29:59.229
From the northwestern
banking association.

30:00.732 --> 30:02.633
I was just doing my job,

30:02.635 --> 30:04.334
With the help
of constable o'reilly.

30:04.336 --> 30:06.103
He'll be receiving
a similar reward

30:06.105 --> 30:07.304
At his new post.

30:08.807 --> 30:12.142
[applause]

30:18.850 --> 30:20.350
The mayor and I
are so honored

30:20.352 --> 30:22.052
You are our
constable, jack.

30:22.054 --> 30:23.754
The honor is mine,
mrs. Ramsey.

30:33.398 --> 30:35.399
Elizabeth...

30:36.401 --> 30:38.035
I don't think I've ever
seen you in red before.

30:38.037 --> 30:40.871
Oh, you won't ever again.

30:40.873 --> 30:42.139
That's a shame.

30:42.141 --> 30:43.207
It suits you.

30:43.209 --> 30:44.808
Then again,

30:44.810 --> 30:47.978
Just about everything
suits you.

30:49.013 --> 30:50.414
That's very kind of you.

30:50.416 --> 30:51.849
It's the truth.

30:51.851 --> 30:53.917
-Unless...
-Unless?

30:53.919 --> 30:55.786
You still think
I'm guilty of...

30:55.788 --> 30:57.821
What was it again?

30:57.823 --> 31:00.157
Oh, yes. Perfidy...

31:00.159 --> 31:02.726
Betrayal, treachery,

31:02.728 --> 31:03.760
Or treason?

31:03.762 --> 31:04.862
You looked it up?

31:04.864 --> 31:06.363
No, I asked that smart kid,
the weaver boy.

31:06.365 --> 31:07.865
I don't have time
to look things up.

31:07.867 --> 31:09.733
I was too busy

31:09.735 --> 31:10.934
Protecting
this town from criminals.

31:10.936 --> 31:11.969
Jack!

31:11.971 --> 31:13.470
We're all
so proud of you.

31:13.472 --> 31:16.073
And a reward,
how deserving.

31:16.075 --> 31:17.741
You could put it
towards the ranch

31:17.743 --> 31:18.876
You always
dreamed of having.

31:18.878 --> 31:19.877
Well...

31:19.879 --> 31:20.944
That was a long time ago.

31:20.946 --> 31:23.247
Oh, it wasn't so long ago.

31:24.749 --> 31:26.416
Remember those sunset
rides we used to take,

31:26.418 --> 31:28.318
Imagining where we'd be
in a few years?

31:28.320 --> 31:30.020
[laughs]
who would have thought

31:30.022 --> 31:32.155
It would be here?

31:34.392 --> 31:36.126
Okay.

31:36.128 --> 31:37.094
I suppose I should...

31:37.096 --> 31:39.096
Start my rounds.

31:39.098 --> 31:40.797
Excuse me, ladies.

31:41.733 --> 31:43.000
[giggles]

31:47.438 --> 31:50.007
Jack, wait up!

32:06.124 --> 32:08.558
[knocks gently]

32:10.795 --> 32:12.062
Hello, mrs. Weaver.

32:12.064 --> 32:13.931
I'm elizabeth thatcher,
the children's teacher.

32:13.933 --> 32:15.899
I was hoping to speak with you
for a moment?

32:15.901 --> 32:17.100
Well, of course.

32:17.102 --> 32:18.101
Come in.

32:18.103 --> 32:19.569
Thank you.

32:24.175 --> 32:25.208
Please, have a seat.

32:25.210 --> 32:26.543
Thank you.

32:32.083 --> 32:33.517
Are my little ones
behaving in school?

32:33.519 --> 32:36.153
Yes, they're
adapting quite well.

32:36.155 --> 32:37.554
It's actually wyatt

32:37.556 --> 32:39.489
I was hoping to
speak with you about.

32:39.491 --> 32:40.524
Oh, no, what did he do?

32:40.526 --> 32:42.893
No! No, no, he's fine.

32:42.895 --> 32:45.228
Um, it's what he can do.

32:47.065 --> 32:48.899
I've been lending
wyatt books.

32:48.901 --> 32:52.069
Advanced texts really meant
for college students,

32:52.071 --> 32:54.304
Yet he sails right through them
as if they were picture books.

32:54.306 --> 32:57.374
Science and math
are as natural to him

32:57.376 --> 33:00.544
As breathing is
to the rest of us,

33:00.546 --> 33:02.846
And his comprehension
of advanced theories is...

33:02.848 --> 33:05.148
It's astounding.

33:06.484 --> 33:08.385
I-I'm not sure I follow.

33:10.154 --> 33:14.524
I believe
wyatt might be a genius.

33:19.497 --> 33:21.565
And if given the chance,

33:21.567 --> 33:23.433
I believe he's capable of things

33:23.435 --> 33:26.403
Far greater
than this place.

33:26.405 --> 33:28.972
He could be the next
thomas edison.

33:30.475 --> 33:32.509
With your permission,
mrs. Weaver,

33:32.511 --> 33:35.879
I'd like to apply for
a scholarship on his behalf

33:35.881 --> 33:37.848
To the college of science
and technology back east,

33:37.850 --> 33:40.917
And I'm quite certain
he would be accepted.

33:42.120 --> 33:44.354
Miss thatcher,

33:44.356 --> 33:46.857
I've always known wyatt's
been blessed with a keen mind,

33:46.859 --> 33:50.560
And I appreciate
your interest in him.

33:50.562 --> 33:54.331
But he's taken it upon himself
to make certain sacrifices.

33:56.234 --> 33:58.335
I'm the only man
left in our family now,

33:58.337 --> 33:59.436
Miss thatcher.

34:03.241 --> 34:05.275
We need my paycheck
from the mine.

34:08.946 --> 34:10.047
Oh, I see.

34:10.049 --> 34:12.416
Maybe in a few years,

34:12.418 --> 34:13.350
When his brothers

34:13.352 --> 34:14.985
Are old enough
to work in the mine,

34:14.987 --> 34:16.219
We can consider more schooling.

34:16.221 --> 34:18.188
Of course.

34:20.191 --> 34:22.359
If you don't mind,

34:22.361 --> 34:23.960
I've brought
some more books for him.

34:32.570 --> 34:35.605
You know, my favorite
thomas edison quote

34:35.607 --> 34:37.541
Was from when he demonstrated
his first light bulb.

34:37.543 --> 34:41.678
He said, "we will make
electricity so cheap--"

34:41.680 --> 34:43.713
[together]: That only the rich
will burn candles."

35:25.556 --> 35:28.291
We're closed,
mr. Gowen.

35:29.293 --> 35:30.594
I didn't come here to eat.

35:30.596 --> 35:32.963
Well, I've already delivered
your share of the weekly profits

35:32.965 --> 35:34.197
To your office.

35:34.199 --> 35:36.733
Yes, thank you
for that.

35:36.735 --> 35:39.202
Doing something different
with your hair?

35:39.204 --> 35:40.604
It looks quite becoming.

35:40.606 --> 35:42.139
And you should be going.

35:44.375 --> 35:46.543
You gave the file to mr. Avery.

35:46.545 --> 35:49.279
I gave it to the constable,
who gave it to mr. Avery,

35:49.281 --> 35:50.347
Despite your threats.

35:51.649 --> 35:54.217
That file only tells
half the story.

35:54.219 --> 35:55.986
It's the other half

35:55.988 --> 35:59.156
That you should be
concerned about.

35:59.158 --> 36:00.490
Why is that?

36:00.492 --> 36:02.592
My lawyer has brought
information

36:02.594 --> 36:05.095
That I believe will be
quite devastating

36:05.097 --> 36:06.663
To both the memory
of your husband

36:06.665 --> 36:08.431
And to your current
situation here.

36:08.433 --> 36:10.767
Is this a new threat,
or the same one?

36:10.769 --> 36:12.135
I'm losing track.

36:14.539 --> 36:16.506
Let me be
perfectly clear with you.

36:17.642 --> 36:20.310
This is a company town.

36:20.312 --> 36:22.179
The company
provides a livelihood

36:22.181 --> 36:26.183
For you
and for everyone in this town.

36:26.185 --> 36:27.217
The real truth

36:27.219 --> 36:29.352
About what happened
in that mine

36:29.354 --> 36:31.288
Is something you,
personally,

36:31.290 --> 36:33.290
Do not wish
to see exposed.

36:33.292 --> 36:37.260
But I will be forced to do so

36:37.262 --> 36:39.563
If you and bill avery
do not stand down.

36:41.065 --> 36:42.132
You're bluffing.

36:42.134 --> 36:44.467
This is not
a poker game, abigail.

36:44.469 --> 36:46.570
Good.

36:46.572 --> 36:48.238
Then you'll understand
when I don't fold.

36:49.740 --> 36:53.343
You can't intimidate me
anymore, mr. Gowen.

36:53.345 --> 36:55.812
[door opens]

36:55.814 --> 36:57.781
I'll ask you to leave,
mr. Gowen.

36:57.783 --> 37:02.052
And I might remind you
that I am a mountie,

37:02.054 --> 37:03.587
With the authority
to arrest you if need be.

37:10.161 --> 37:11.561
On what grounds?

37:11.563 --> 37:13.597
Impeding
an investigation

37:13.599 --> 37:15.165
And harassment
of a witness.

37:20.671 --> 37:24.207
[quietly]
I'm going to ruin you.

37:33.384 --> 37:35.252
[gunshot]

37:35.254 --> 37:37.787
Here you are.

37:39.123 --> 37:40.657
You always had
great aim.

37:40.659 --> 37:44.461
Well, you know,
I've missed once or twice.

37:44.463 --> 37:45.829
My turn.

37:49.800 --> 37:52.702
[gunshot]

37:52.704 --> 37:53.637
That's impressive.

37:53.639 --> 37:56.673
I forgot what a good
sportswoman you are.

37:56.675 --> 37:57.607
Do you remember

37:57.609 --> 37:59.442
The last time
we went shooting,

37:59.444 --> 38:02.412
I beat you
best of three.

38:02.414 --> 38:03.647
Vaguely.

38:03.649 --> 38:06.750
[laughs] of course you do.

38:10.521 --> 38:12.355
[gunshot]

38:14.292 --> 38:16.426
And does elizabeth shoot?

38:16.428 --> 38:18.295
Or does she just
read about it

38:18.297 --> 38:21.364
In her novels?

38:21.366 --> 38:23.133
You know,
if I didn't know better,

38:23.135 --> 38:24.768
I'd say you were jealous.

38:27.238 --> 38:31.174
I am...

38:31.176 --> 38:32.776
Completely jealous.

38:32.778 --> 38:34.477
[gunshot]

38:34.479 --> 38:36.780
I used to have you
all to myself.

38:36.782 --> 38:38.481
Now I not only
have to share you

38:38.483 --> 38:39.616
With the mounties,

38:39.618 --> 38:42.452
But also with
a schoolteacher.

38:43.321 --> 38:45.488
Of course, I can
put up with anything

38:45.490 --> 38:47.390
Temporarily.

38:47.392 --> 38:49.259
You are so persistent.

38:49.261 --> 38:51.328
As an actress, I have to be.

38:51.330 --> 38:52.629
Well, as a lady, you don't.

38:52.631 --> 38:54.964
I wish that were true.

38:56.801 --> 38:59.669
I know things
didn't end well between us.

38:59.671 --> 39:01.738
But they will
this time.

39:01.740 --> 39:03.440
Jack...

39:03.442 --> 39:05.709
We have a future,

39:05.711 --> 39:08.244
And it's going to be exciting,

39:08.246 --> 39:11.548
And unpredictable, and...

39:11.550 --> 39:13.350
Perfect,

39:13.352 --> 39:15.518
Just like we always dreamed.

39:17.888 --> 39:19.889
I'm sorry, rosie,

39:19.891 --> 39:21.624
But the only future
I see for myself

39:21.626 --> 39:22.692
Is with elizabeth.

39:24.762 --> 39:25.895
Well, then,

39:25.897 --> 39:28.798
I am just going to have
to change your mind.

39:28.800 --> 39:30.600
And you know me, jack.

39:30.602 --> 39:32.702
Once I set my sights
on something,

39:32.704 --> 39:35.238
I always get it.

39:35.240 --> 39:37.273

About elizabeth?

What's that?

40:49.514 --> 40:50.480
Well, she's leaving.

40:53.884 --> 40:55.652
Wait, what do you mean,
she's leaving?

40:55.654 --> 40:59.022
Well, she got offered
a job back east,

40:59.024 --> 41:00.890
A very prestigious
one, I hear.

41:02.793 --> 41:03.960
