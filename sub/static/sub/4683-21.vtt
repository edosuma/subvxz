WEBVTT

00:20.933 --> 00:23.233
I'll be back. I'm free!

01:06.566 --> 01:07.833
What, are you nuts?

01:07.900 --> 01:09.166
I'm leaving to go
to your birthday party.

01:09.233 --> 01:11.266
You're still here.

01:11.333 --> 01:14.800
Fred, did you ever see
a cake with 40 candles on it?

01:14.866 --> 01:17.300
- Not a pretty sight.
- Yeah.

01:17.366 --> 01:18.966
Well, I'm gonna have to go
through this in about six months

01:19.033 --> 01:21.100
so...make you a deal.

01:21.166 --> 01:23.566
You show up at your party,
I'll show up at mine.

01:24.766 --> 01:27.666
Nah!
It's not just turning 40.

01:28.633 --> 01:29.933
I had a fight with John today

01:30.000 --> 01:32.833
and I was hopin' he'd stop by.

01:32.900 --> 01:34.633
Buddy, my boy.

01:34.700 --> 01:37.433
Uh, as your friend, listen up!

01:37.500 --> 01:39.533
You can't keep trying
to run your kid's life.

01:40.466 --> 01:42.233
He's young.

01:42.300 --> 01:44.800
We're old.

01:44.866 --> 01:47.366
'Accept it.'

01:47.433 --> 01:49.200
It's just..

01:49.266 --> 01:52.733
...I hate to see him
throw his life away.

01:52.800 --> 01:56.700
He's got it all ahead of him.
We don't.

01:56.766 --> 01:58.600
Oh, God!

01:58.666 --> 02:00.133
The things I'd do different

02:00.200 --> 02:02.100
if I could do 'em
all over again.

02:02.166 --> 02:04.133
No, we can't.

02:04.200 --> 02:06.366
It's his turn.

02:06.433 --> 02:09.066
So let him have it.

02:09.133 --> 02:10.466
Out with the old, you know.

02:10.533 --> 02:11.900
God..

02:15.033 --> 02:17.133
See you at the party, okay?

02:20.533 --> 02:21.800
Okay?

02:22.733 --> 02:24.766
Yeah, okay.

02:39.566 --> 02:41.600
Hey, old man.

02:41.666 --> 02:43.800
'We wanna talk to you.'

02:52.500 --> 02:54.866
Out with the old, you know.

03:26.500 --> 03:28.300
'This one's been tough.'

03:28.366 --> 03:31.366
'But I guess you out of all of
us who would expect that.'

03:31.433 --> 03:33.766
'Yes, unfortunately.'

03:33.833 --> 03:35.800
'Well, at least he's the last.'

03:35.866 --> 03:38.533
'Our work's almost finished.'

03:38.600 --> 03:42.000
'Do you want me
to lend you a hand?'

03:42.066 --> 03:44.933
'No, he's my problem.'

03:45.000 --> 03:47.666
- 'My disgrace.'
- 'Go for it.'

03:47.733 --> 03:50.000
- 'For the corporation.'
- 'For the corporation.'

04:30.933 --> 04:33.233
Who needs sentimentality?

04:36.100 --> 04:38.900
It's time to answer
for your crimes.

04:38.966 --> 04:42.633
Your outdated values.
Your forced morality.

04:42.700 --> 04:44.100
'Your hypocrisy.'

04:44.166 --> 04:46.766
You used to think
just like me.

04:46.833 --> 04:49.600
'We were the same.'

04:49.666 --> 04:52.733
I had your disease.

04:52.800 --> 04:54.133
And now..

04:55.700 --> 04:57.600
'...I think for myself.'

05:00.766 --> 05:02.466
Disease?

05:02.533 --> 05:03.833
You're old.

05:04.900 --> 05:06.366
Too old.

05:06.433 --> 05:09.466
'Too afraid to face yourself,
your family.'

05:09.533 --> 05:12.333
You couldn't ever make
your own birthday party.

05:12.400 --> 05:14.333
It was, it was them.

05:15.533 --> 05:17.566
It's not me.

05:17.633 --> 05:21.200
I was coming.

05:21.266 --> 05:24.666
Sure, blame the young.

05:24.733 --> 05:27.566
Blame the innocent
for your fears.

05:27.633 --> 05:29.166
'I'm afraid
the only contribution'

05:29.233 --> 05:31.866
you've made to this world..

05:31.933 --> 05:33.900
...is to give life to me.

05:36.233 --> 05:38.400
Son, oh.

05:38.466 --> 05:39.566
Oh.

05:41.066 --> 05:42.233
Please.

05:42.300 --> 05:45.066
Too late, daddy.

05:48.000 --> 05:49.300
'No!'

05:51.266 --> 05:52.833
Father is up.

05:52.900 --> 05:56.766
I can't believe he is stil
having nightmares.

05:56.833 --> 05:58.100
When I ask him
what they are about

05:58.166 --> 06:01.533
he just g-gives me
this dirty look.

06:01.600 --> 06:04.400
He didn't even
make his party last night.

06:04.466 --> 06:07.233
Oh, I know it's hard, dear.

06:07.300 --> 06:10.166
He is going through
this mid-life thing.

06:10.766 --> 06:12.466
Spare with him.

06:15.733 --> 06:17.733
- Hi, dad.
- Hi.

06:22.000 --> 06:24.700
Why don't you start eating?
And I'll go get the paper.

06:30.066 --> 06:31.566
How is work?

06:32.900 --> 06:35.766
I told you,
I got a new boss coming in today

06:35.833 --> 06:38.266
sent out from the parent company

06:38.333 --> 06:39.800
Chemico Inc.

06:39.866 --> 06:41.133
Great.

06:41.200 --> 06:43.766
Hey, Chemico's
in the Fortune 500.

06:43.833 --> 06:46.033
'They are one of the top
architectural firms'

06:46.100 --> 06:48.466
in the world.

06:48.533 --> 06:50.300
Buy some stock, dad.

06:50.366 --> 06:52.700
That's why you
and I don't relate.

06:52.766 --> 06:54.366
You and your whole generation

06:54.433 --> 06:56.600
all you care about is money.

06:56.666 --> 06:59.266
Dad, that's not true.

06:59.333 --> 07:01.433
Money is no good
unless it can buy

07:01.500 --> 07:04.166
fast cars and faster women.

07:05.766 --> 07:09.666
Okay. "Forbes,"
"Wall Street Journal."

07:11.366 --> 07:14.966
"Springwood Star Times,"
"Greenpeace Monthly."

07:16.166 --> 07:18.700
"Money." "Finance".

07:20.500 --> 07:22.966
'And "Save The Whales"
newsletter.'

07:28.666 --> 07:30.600
John..

07:30.666 --> 07:32.766
...you should stay open

07:32.833 --> 07:34.766
to more humanistic issues.

07:36.700 --> 07:39.600
Look, ugh, just because
I don't run around

07:39.666 --> 07:43.366
in Paisley shirts
carrying "Ban the bomb"signs

07:43.433 --> 07:47.100
doesn't mean
I don't love my fellow man.

07:47.166 --> 07:49.866
Just as long as
he doesn't earn more than I do.

07:53.266 --> 07:54.533
'Bye bye, mom.'

07:54.600 --> 07:56.200
Goodbye, sweetie.

08:08.333 --> 08:11.266
Buddy boys have been
behind the times.

08:11.333 --> 08:14.800
But I'm about to give him
a little food for thought.

08:26.833 --> 08:29.133
'What's the matter?
You can't afford dressing?'

08:29.200 --> 08:33.333
I like salsa,
it calms me down.

08:33.400 --> 08:36.066
Never made it
to the party, huh?

08:36.133 --> 08:38.000
What have I got to celebrate?

08:38.066 --> 08:39.800
Out with the old, remember?

08:39.866 --> 08:42.500
My, aren't we a little
self-pitying these days?

08:42.566 --> 08:43.733
'Yeah, maybe.'

08:43.800 --> 08:46.700
But at least it's in
the proper social context.

08:47.566 --> 08:50.100
Now I gotta deal with this crap.

08:50.166 --> 08:51.633
Ah, I see,
our new imperious leader

08:51.700 --> 08:53.133
gave you the
Coldwater assignment.

08:53.200 --> 08:54.633
You got it.

08:54.700 --> 08:58.000
I'm supposed to design
a headquarters for banking firm

08:58.066 --> 09:01.800
that must be planted in the
middle of the Coldwater Valley.

09:01.866 --> 09:03.833
So much for the scenery.

09:03.900 --> 09:07.166
I'm getting tired
of selling out the ecosystem

09:07.233 --> 09:09.533
just to give suites more homes.

09:09.600 --> 09:10.833
Better take the assignment.

09:10.900 --> 09:13.166
I hear this guy doesn't take no.

09:13.233 --> 09:15.400
Yeah, just what we need.

09:15.466 --> 09:19.200
Another thumb-sucking,
power-hungry yuppie.

09:19.266 --> 09:21.966
How old is the little
fascist, 12?

09:22.033 --> 09:24.400
No, 25.

09:26.266 --> 09:28.766
In my office...now.

09:31.666 --> 09:34.733
In his office...now.

09:34.800 --> 09:38.466
This is my first day, so let me
make a few things clear.

09:39.233 --> 09:40.566
Number one.

09:40.633 --> 09:41.933
I chose you for this assignment

09:42.000 --> 09:44.200
because you are
this firm's best architect

09:44.266 --> 09:47.633
and Springwood National Bank
is our best account.

09:47.700 --> 09:50.000
Well, Mr. Trainer,
I mean no disrespect, but I--

09:50.066 --> 09:51.900
You interrupt me again

09:51.966 --> 09:54.533
and you can hike it back
to the old folks home.

09:55.600 --> 09:58.666
Got it? Good.

09:58.733 --> 10:00.800
Number two.

10:00.866 --> 10:03.300
You wear suites to this
office from now on.

10:03.366 --> 10:04.566
'And number three'

10:04.633 --> 10:08.266
'all personal clutter
is to be removed.'

10:09.466 --> 10:12.700
Now...get started
on that assignment.

10:26.033 --> 10:27.966
Hi, dad.

10:28.033 --> 10:30.266
What's all this?

10:30.333 --> 10:31.666
School project.

10:31.733 --> 10:33.900
Take a look.

10:33.966 --> 10:35.966
Some of the town's
environmental burnouts

10:36.033 --> 10:38.200
are trying to stop the bank
from opening in the valley.

10:38.266 --> 10:43.166
So we are starting a movement
to push it forward.

10:43.233 --> 10:46.100
Who knows, in three years
we might be running that bank.

10:46.166 --> 10:49.066
- 'Be careful don't tear it.'
- 'Don't..'

10:49.133 --> 10:50.833
Here we go.
That's good.

10:50.900 --> 10:51.933
Alright, guys..

10:53.266 --> 10:56.666
First the power monger at work
calls me Methuselah.

10:56.733 --> 11:00.166
And I find out my own kid
is helping destroy

11:00.233 --> 11:02.233
whatever little life
I have left.

11:02.300 --> 11:05.800
Come on, don't go start
dragging John into this.

11:05.866 --> 11:07.900
Well, he is in this.

11:07.966 --> 11:10.400
And all his friends too.

11:10.466 --> 11:14.133
God, how can he be
so different from us?

11:14.200 --> 11:16.433
We raised him.

11:16.500 --> 11:19.600
He's so, he's so..

11:19.666 --> 11:20.933
Eighties?

11:24.166 --> 11:27.833
I feel like a dinosaur
heading for the tar pit.

11:27.900 --> 11:31.200
And my own son
eager to give me a push.

11:33.600 --> 11:35.833
You're not gonna like this.

11:35.900 --> 11:38.166
But you sound
just like our parents

11:38.233 --> 11:40.600
when we were rebelling.

11:40.666 --> 11:43.300
Try and see it
through John's eyes.

11:43.366 --> 11:46.266
That's what I'm afraid of.

12:00.633 --> 12:03.733
Oh, no. No.

12:37.133 --> 12:39.333
What are you reading?

12:39.400 --> 12:41.133
Something sad.

12:47.433 --> 12:49.900
What the hell is that?

12:49.966 --> 12:52.666
New school project.

12:52.733 --> 12:55.366
What kind of school project?

12:55.433 --> 12:56.800
Classified.

12:58.400 --> 13:00.033
I need a lift.

13:08.300 --> 13:10.333
Classified?

13:22.133 --> 13:24.233
You should've listened.

13:24.300 --> 13:26.266
Out with the old.

13:32.766 --> 13:34.666
Listen to who?

13:38.800 --> 13:41.766
Great! Kid's a genius.

13:41.833 --> 13:44.166
Can't even remember his book.

13:47.033 --> 13:49.300
'Because you are
the corporation.'

13:57.566 --> 13:59.833
I brought John's book.

14:06.833 --> 14:09.000
You don't belong here.

14:35.900 --> 14:39.600
Hey, hey, hey!

14:39.666 --> 14:41.433
Are you in there?

14:43.300 --> 14:45.300
I gotta find Fred.

14:46.233 --> 14:48.500
Fred!

14:48.566 --> 14:50.533
Fred.

14:50.600 --> 14:53.266
Hey, hey, hey.
You know where Fred Thomas is?

14:53.333 --> 14:55.933
He, he works here.
Do you know where he is?

14:58.933 --> 15:02.333
Has everybody taken
stupid pills here tonight?

15:02.400 --> 15:06.033
Where is Fred Thomas?
Chief engineer. He works here!

15:06.100 --> 15:07.633
Where is..

15:13.166 --> 15:14.466
Uh..

15:15.866 --> 15:18.766
Fred? Fred!

15:18.833 --> 15:20.900
Fred, what's going on,
Fred, Fred?

15:31.633 --> 15:34.166
Hey, you!
You, wait!

15:34.233 --> 15:37.133
Hey, Fred, Fred, Fr..

15:39.700 --> 15:41.300
Come.

15:41.366 --> 15:44.133
Walk with me.
Talk with me.

15:46.466 --> 15:47.766
'Time to get
with the new system.'

15:47.833 --> 15:49.100
'Don't you think, buddy?'

15:52.200 --> 15:55.200
Uh-oh, don't do that.

15:55.266 --> 15:57.300
You'll ruin the material.

16:00.833 --> 16:02.633
What's happening here?

16:02.700 --> 16:05.100
'Oh, I'm afraid
it's already happened.'

16:05.166 --> 16:08.800
You're familiar with, "Out with
the old, in with the new?"

16:08.866 --> 16:11.433
Yeah, it's a popular tune.

16:12.933 --> 16:15.366
Guess which end you're on?

16:15.433 --> 16:18.333
What happened to Fred?

16:18.400 --> 16:20.966
Well, he was...corrected.

16:28.566 --> 16:29.833
Like you.

16:45.600 --> 16:47.333
'Mike, we're set up here.
Come to the back.'

16:47.400 --> 16:49.966
'Yes, sir. You two come with me
around this way.'

16:57.333 --> 17:01.266
'Yes, the subject
has just arrived.'

17:01.333 --> 17:04.600
'He must be brought in..'

17:04.666 --> 17:07.133
'He's not suitable
for reprogramming.'

17:07.200 --> 17:09.100
Yes, I agree.

17:09.166 --> 17:11.233
It's hopeless.

17:11.300 --> 17:13.866
I know it's required.

17:13.933 --> 17:15.333
For the corporation.

17:15.400 --> 17:17.000
'For the corporation.'

17:25.666 --> 17:29.100
Who makes these things?
Sshh-sshh-sshh.

17:39.566 --> 17:40.966
Dana!

17:43.733 --> 17:45.100
Dana!

18:07.766 --> 18:10.666
'Dad!'

18:10.733 --> 18:13.900
'We know you're in there.'

18:13.966 --> 18:17.433
'Come on, dad, we'll go and
listen to the Grateful Dead.'

18:18.566 --> 18:19.733
'Daddy!'

18:21.933 --> 18:24.333
'Loose the door.'

18:46.700 --> 18:50.366
Your generation stuck us
with your mistakes.

18:50.433 --> 18:52.866
Now it's time to erase
those mistakes.

18:56.466 --> 18:58.800
Bud Powers.

18:58.866 --> 19:00.833
We are here to determine
your relevance

19:00.900 --> 19:03.033
to contemporary society.

19:03.100 --> 19:06.966
A legal aid has been
assigned to you.

19:11.433 --> 19:13.933
Wow, man!

19:14.000 --> 19:16.500
What a trip.

19:16.566 --> 19:19.333
Buddy Powers.

19:19.400 --> 19:21.433
You claim to stand
for something.

19:21.500 --> 19:23.066
Tell me!

19:23.133 --> 19:26.300
When was the last time you
donated your talents freely

19:26.366 --> 19:29.233
for the sake of an issue?

19:29.300 --> 19:31.433
1970.

19:31.500 --> 19:33.700
But I haven't had much time.

19:33.766 --> 19:36.966
Do you now or have you ever

19:37.033 --> 19:39.900
worn a
"Save The Whales" T-shirt?

19:39.966 --> 19:41.800
I used to.

19:41.866 --> 19:44.033
Now my wife, she..

19:44.100 --> 19:47.866
...uses them for dust clothes.

19:47.933 --> 19:49.766
That's cold.

19:49.833 --> 19:52.933
This case is closed.
You sold out.

19:53.000 --> 19:55.033
- 'You're out of here.'
- 'Bye-bye.'

19:56.533 --> 19:58.900
Hey, sorry, man.

20:02.766 --> 20:06.500
Where is my wife?

20:06.566 --> 20:09.233
She's being...completed.

20:12.700 --> 20:13.966
'Come.'

20:14.866 --> 20:17.366
Walk with me.
Talk with me.

20:39.800 --> 20:40.866
Dana!

21:02.566 --> 21:05.966
You! Your kind.

21:06.033 --> 21:07.633
You're obsolete.

21:07.700 --> 21:10.000
But you knew that
a long time ago.

21:10.066 --> 21:13.166
That's why you abandoned
your ideals, isn't it?

21:21.000 --> 21:23.766
You failed my test, daddy.

21:24.966 --> 21:26.200
You failed.

21:30.300 --> 21:31.633
Complete him.

21:49.333 --> 21:50.500
Johnny.

22:06.533 --> 22:08.900
Dad. Oh, my God!

22:08.966 --> 22:12.100
Dad, what happened?
Who did this to you?

22:12.966 --> 22:14.433
John..

22:15.700 --> 22:16.866
I'm sorry.

22:20.000 --> 22:21.233
'I tried.'

22:21.300 --> 22:24.833
They, they found me.

22:24.900 --> 22:26.866
Call me...old man.

22:26.933 --> 22:29.100
Sshh, dad, don't speak, okay?

22:29.166 --> 22:31.600
I'm gonna call
an ambulance. Hold on.

22:33.200 --> 22:35.300
It's too late.

22:35.366 --> 22:37.266
No, I'm not gonna let you die!

22:37.333 --> 22:38.266
Hold on.

22:43.266 --> 22:44.366
'Hello, hurry!'

22:44.433 --> 22:46.800
Send an ambulance to 8120,
Webb Avenue.

22:46.866 --> 22:49.266
My father's just been stabbed.

22:49.333 --> 22:52.333
Dad, don't die, please.

22:52.400 --> 22:55.000
I'm sorry, we argued,
just, don't die..

22:56.866 --> 22:58.266
I'm sorry, John.

23:01.300 --> 23:02.933
It's your turn now.

23:03.000 --> 23:06.033
Dad, no. I'm sorry.

23:06.100 --> 23:08.633
I love you.
Do you hear me?

23:11.200 --> 23:12.533
I love you.

23:19.566 --> 23:23.866
Growing old can be
a painful experience.

23:29.400 --> 23:33.000
'I don't know.
He's kinda cute.'

23:33.066 --> 23:35.966
'Oh, I don't know.
Looks like trouble to me.'

23:36.033 --> 23:37.433
Well, we keep looking.
What do you say?

23:37.500 --> 23:39.600
Yes, I think
you're done here.

23:39.666 --> 23:41.300
I think there's some more
around this corner.

24:00.200 --> 24:03.533
No, I want my real parents.

24:03.600 --> 24:06.166
- Come on.
- My real parents.

24:06.233 --> 24:07.966
Don't take me, please.

24:11.233 --> 24:15.233
Do you know
who your parents are?

24:15.300 --> 24:16.900
Hmm?

24:21.666 --> 24:25.300
I have asked you not to sleep
in your clothes.

24:25.366 --> 24:27.600
Don't start on me, mom.

24:27.666 --> 24:30.166
I didn't mean to.
I just felt asleep reading

24:30.233 --> 24:32.366
Reading?
Of course you did.

24:32.433 --> 24:34.433
'How late were you out
last night?'

24:34.500 --> 24:37.633
'It's no wonder people talk.'

24:37.700 --> 24:39.866
Let 'em talk.
I know I'm not a slut.

24:39.933 --> 24:42.333
Well, you'd never know
the way you dress.

24:42.400 --> 24:44.533
I bought you a closet
full of dresses and skirts

24:44.600 --> 24:47.300
and you wear ratty jeans?

24:47.366 --> 24:49.900
Look, mom..

24:49.966 --> 24:52.500
...I'll start wearing clothes
next week.

24:52.566 --> 24:54.900
I'm just working
my way up, okay?

24:54.966 --> 24:58.233
I just want you to fit in.
Is that so wrong?

24:58.300 --> 25:00.700
How can you walk around
school like that?

25:00.766 --> 25:04.166
It's no wonder that misfit John
is your only friend.

25:05.600 --> 25:07.600
How would you know?

25:07.666 --> 25:09.766
You buy me dresses
that are three sizes too big

25:09.833 --> 25:11.800
and ten years too late.

25:11.866 --> 25:15.133
- You don't know who I am.
- Well, I guess not.

25:15.200 --> 25:18.233
I swear, sometimes I wonder
if you're really my daughter.

25:18.866 --> 25:20.366
Don't say that.

25:26.666 --> 25:28.833
I don't even look like her.

25:32.133 --> 25:34.800
Maybe the gypsies left me
at the doorstep.

25:42.400 --> 25:45.266
Hey, you didn't call me
last night.

25:45.333 --> 25:48.433
Sorry.
It's my mother.

25:48.500 --> 25:50.533
- Oh, no.
- The usual.

25:50.600 --> 25:53.166
Is she still trying
to get you into dresses?

25:53.233 --> 25:54.433
Into dresses
and out of everything

25:54.500 --> 25:56.566
I like about good stuff.

25:56.633 --> 25:58.966
I can't do anything she likes.

25:59.033 --> 26:00.566
What are parents for?

26:00.633 --> 26:01.733
Yeah.

26:03.333 --> 26:05.500
John, have you ever felt like..

26:05.566 --> 26:08.433
Well, like
you just don't belong.

26:08.500 --> 26:10.100
You mean,
you feel like an alien

26:10.166 --> 26:13.533
and your parents are mutan
humanoids from the deep?

26:13.600 --> 26:17.066
It's more of a feeling of fear
that I belong to someone else.

26:17.133 --> 26:19.966
- That I'm not her child.
- Yeah, I've felt like that.

26:20.566 --> 26:21.700
Really?

26:22.866 --> 26:24.433
When?

26:24.500 --> 26:27.333
Right after I found out
I was adopted.

26:27.400 --> 26:28.666
I never felt worse.

26:32.500 --> 26:34.833
Why didn't you
ever say anything?

26:34.900 --> 26:37.666
I mean, why didn't you
ever tell me that before?

26:37.733 --> 26:40.733
I just didn't feel
like talking about it.

26:40.800 --> 26:43.033
I'm not so sure
I'm ready now.

26:43.100 --> 26:46.300
But after my father was killed

26:46.366 --> 26:48.966
it started me thinking
about my natural parents.

26:50.066 --> 26:51.766
My real dad.

26:51.833 --> 26:53.733
Did you ever try
to find them?

26:53.800 --> 26:56.433
Find out where they live
or what they-what they do?

26:56.500 --> 26:59.400
Yeah, well, I talked over
with my mom...once.

26:59.466 --> 27:00.800
And?

27:00.866 --> 27:03.300
And I think
my idealized version

27:03.366 --> 27:05.133
is safer for now.

27:05.200 --> 27:08.366
How would you know unless you
try to find out for yourself?

27:08.433 --> 27:11.200
Well, see, that's the thing,
I'm afraid to find out.

27:12.266 --> 27:13.300
Why?

27:14.533 --> 27:17.233
I may not like what I find

27:17.933 --> 27:19.033
See ya.

27:22.866 --> 27:24.200
Adopted.

27:29.233 --> 27:30.900
Mom, are you home?

27:39.200 --> 27:41.533
"Gone to PTA meeting.
Dinner in the oven.

27:41.600 --> 27:44.100
Be back at 4:00.
Love, mom."

27:46.766 --> 27:49.100
PTA. Yuck.

27:51.900 --> 27:53.366
Come on.

27:56.733 --> 27:59.500
If I were a birth certificate..

27:59.566 --> 28:01.366
...what would I look like?

28:04.000 --> 28:06.033
And where the hell would I be?

28:08.800 --> 28:10.300
The bedroom.

28:43.633 --> 28:46.233
What are you doing
in my room?

28:46.300 --> 28:49.066
I'm, I'm looking
for a recipe.

28:49.133 --> 28:52.000
In my closet?
Next time try the kitchen.

28:52.066 --> 28:53.600
I'll clean it up.
I promise.

28:53.666 --> 28:57.366
That is not the point.
Show some respect for my things.

28:57.433 --> 28:59.733
I guess I can't do
anything right, can I?

28:59.800 --> 29:02.000
What's gotten
into you lately?

29:02.066 --> 29:03.733
I know I'm different.

29:03.800 --> 29:06.866
But sometimes you act like
I don't belong to you at all.

29:08.600 --> 29:09.700
Uhh!

29:27.700 --> 29:28.933
- Please.
- 'No.'

29:29.900 --> 29:30.833
Please.

29:33.166 --> 29:34.366
'Please.'

29:36.333 --> 29:39.233
Um, this one's cute.
How much is this one?

29:42.666 --> 29:47.100
It says here that her parents
were taken away?

29:48.733 --> 29:51.733
She also needs her shots.

29:51.800 --> 29:54.033
But we'll take her anyway.

29:54.100 --> 29:55.500
Sign here.

30:01.600 --> 30:05.000
No, I don't wanna go with her.

30:05.066 --> 30:07.800
'Where's my real parents?'

30:07.866 --> 30:10.133
I want my real mommy and daddy.

30:10.200 --> 30:12.233
I'm your mother now, dear.

30:12.300 --> 30:15.000
Don't be afraid. We'll take
real good care of you.

30:15.066 --> 30:16.533
'No!'

30:16.600 --> 30:18.866
Help.
No, come on, please.

30:18.933 --> 30:21.100
Come on. I'll be good this time.
I promise.

30:21.166 --> 30:23.400
No!

30:23.466 --> 30:24.433
Please, no!

30:24.500 --> 30:26.500
No, no. Come on.

30:26.566 --> 30:28.066
'No-no-no-o!'

30:28.133 --> 30:29.433
'Help!'

30:31.100 --> 30:33.733
'No-o!'

30:57.300 --> 31:00.300
- 'Hello?'
- Hello. Is John there?

31:00.366 --> 31:03.033
'No, uh,
John doesn't live here.'

31:03.100 --> 31:05.833
I'm sorry.
I must have a wrong number.

31:37.566 --> 31:41.433
Um, I'm sorry, but this is
my friend John's seat.

31:46.633 --> 31:48.066
'Gate Denton?'

31:48.133 --> 31:49.866
'Yeah, here.'

31:49.933 --> 31:51.600
- 'E. Caffey?'
- 'Yeah.'

31:52.533 --> 31:54.200
Steve Sandawal?

31:54.266 --> 31:55.733
'Yeah.'

31:55.800 --> 31:57.800
'Christina Young?'

31:58.666 --> 31:59.933
'Michael Elsworthy?'

32:01.366 --> 32:04.733
'For Friday, please, draw up
questions on page 49.'

32:05.900 --> 32:07.566
'Scotty, wait up.'

32:10.366 --> 32:13.800
I noticed John isn't here today.
You didn't call his name.

32:13.866 --> 32:15.800
- Is he sick?
- Who?

32:15.866 --> 32:18.400
John.
You know, John Powers.

32:21.033 --> 32:24.500
- That name isn't here.
- The name has to be there.

32:24.566 --> 32:26.033
He's my friend.

32:26.100 --> 32:28.200
Not anymore.

32:28.266 --> 32:31.066
Look, he's been here every day
for four years.

32:31.133 --> 32:33.466
You must remember him.
He used to sit right over here.

32:34.933 --> 32:38.400
Melanie Wulff sits there.
Always has.

32:38.466 --> 32:40.200
John used to sit there.

32:40.266 --> 32:42.233
Please, you have to
help me find him.

32:42.300 --> 32:43.933
I don't remember him.

32:44.000 --> 32:46.833
Therefore I can't
help you find him.

32:46.900 --> 32:49.733
Now if you don't stop
bothering me.

32:49.800 --> 32:53.633
Maybe we're gonna
have to have you recalled.

33:11.100 --> 33:14.800
Do we, do we have a copy
of my birth certificate?

33:15.466 --> 33:17.166
Why do you ask?

33:17.233 --> 33:18.766
Um..

33:18.833 --> 33:22.300
...we're doing this
school project on family trees

33:22.366 --> 33:24.633
and it's-it's like
show and tell.

33:26.100 --> 33:29.233
I'll write that information
down for you later tonight.

33:29.300 --> 33:32.600
But teacher said that we need
to have our birth certificate.

33:32.666 --> 33:36.200
So no one cheats, you know.
Makes up a phony family.

33:36.266 --> 33:40.533
Look, we lost those records
in a very unfortunate accident.

33:41.666 --> 33:44.033
What accident?

33:44.100 --> 33:47.133
Our first house burned down
in a freak fire.

33:47.200 --> 33:49.900
Lost all the copies too.

33:49.966 --> 33:52.766
Oh, what about the hospital
where I was born?

33:52.833 --> 33:55.700
Wouldn't they have a copy
of the records?

33:55.766 --> 33:59.433
Nice try, but we didn't have you
in a hospital.

33:59.500 --> 34:01.233
'Your father and I thought
it would be nice'

34:01.300 --> 34:02.900
to have you at home.

34:02.966 --> 34:04.966
Natural and all.

34:05.033 --> 34:07.766
Too bad he's not around
to see how big you've grown.

34:10.200 --> 34:13.600
Why can't you just talk to me
plain and simple?

34:13.666 --> 34:16.366
Why play games with me?

34:16.433 --> 34:18.466
What are you trying to hide?

34:19.166 --> 34:20.733
'Tell me!'

34:22.533 --> 34:26.533
Inka dinka slinky
fonden twinka.

34:27.633 --> 34:29.100
Excuse me?

34:30.266 --> 34:33.733
Smeady tonna

34:34.966 --> 34:37.800
Deka fafa.

34:37.866 --> 34:39.233
Continka?

34:41.266 --> 34:43.100
Well, I have had it.

34:43.166 --> 34:45.866
It's obvious we don't speak
the same language.

35:42.833 --> 35:44.700
I'm second hand.

36:04.633 --> 36:06.166
No.

36:08.966 --> 36:11.133
The place from my dreams.

36:14.233 --> 36:16.133
Is this where I came from?

36:18.366 --> 36:21.400
- It can't be true.
- Hello, hello.

36:23.333 --> 36:25.533
One of ours has returned.

36:26.900 --> 36:28.766
Can I help you?

36:28.833 --> 36:31.466
No refunds, no returns.

36:31.533 --> 36:33.666
I'm looking
for my real parents.

36:34.866 --> 36:38.100
You're looking
for your real parents?

36:38.166 --> 36:39.433
- Yes.
- Oh!

36:40.933 --> 36:44.566
There's only one,
your real mother.

36:46.400 --> 36:48.433
I have to find her.

36:50.433 --> 36:53.700
You sure
that's what you want?

36:53.766 --> 36:54.800
I'm sure.

36:57.766 --> 36:59.200
Fair enough.

37:02.066 --> 37:03.566
Be my guest.

37:51.566 --> 37:52.866
Hello?

38:07.966 --> 38:10.266
They gave me this address.

38:10.333 --> 38:12.500
Only address to give, babe.

38:13.866 --> 38:14.933
You..

38:16.633 --> 38:19.300
You're my mother?

38:19.366 --> 38:23.166
You turned out every bit as ugly
as I thought you would.

38:23.233 --> 38:25.200
'Glad I gave you away.'

38:26.100 --> 38:27.600
This can't be.

38:29.066 --> 38:32.566
- This isn't possible.
- You're spoiling our reunion.

38:33.900 --> 38:36.333
Got some men comin' over later.

38:36.400 --> 38:38.800
We'll have a real party.

38:38.866 --> 38:41.666
You probably got
some of your mom's talents.

38:46.466 --> 38:49.800
If you're my mother,
who is my father?

38:50.900 --> 38:52.866
Had a lot of women that one.

38:52.933 --> 38:56.300
Can't say we met
under the best of circumstances.

38:57.400 --> 39:01.133
- Who was he?
- Bad taste in clothes.

39:01.200 --> 39:03.933
Wore the same sweater
all the time.

39:04.000 --> 39:05.700
'Nice hat though.'

39:05.766 --> 39:07.600
Who was he?

39:07.666 --> 39:09.766
His name was Freddy.

39:12.633 --> 39:15.500
Welcome home, darling.

39:27.233 --> 39:29.000
More food!

39:38.666 --> 39:40.833
Feed the other misfits.

40:01.333 --> 40:05.100
One of us. One of us.
One of us.

40:05.166 --> 40:08.500
One of us. One of us.
One of us.

40:08.566 --> 40:11.400
One of us. One of us.
One of us..

40:11.466 --> 40:13.200
I wanna go home.

40:13.266 --> 40:16.500
One of us. One of us.
One of us.

40:16.566 --> 40:19.366
One of us. One of us.
One of us..

40:19.433 --> 40:22.066
I want my life back.

40:22.133 --> 40:23.733
'One of us..'

40:23.800 --> 40:27.266
- I don't belong here.
- 'One of us. One of us.'

40:27.333 --> 40:30.100
- Just stop.. This is my home.
- 'One of us. One of us.'

40:37.300 --> 40:39.166
I'm your friend, remember?

40:39.233 --> 40:41.400
John.

40:41.466 --> 40:43.233
Will you help me
get out of here?

40:43.300 --> 40:44.533
I'll help you.

40:45.133 --> 40:47.033
Come on.

40:58.766 --> 41:00.900
You'll never come off it.

41:00.966 --> 41:03.600
You're stained for life.
Just like me.

41:03.666 --> 41:05.000
Oh.

41:05.066 --> 41:07.533
How do you get out of here

41:07.600 --> 41:09.100
We both will.

41:16.700 --> 41:18.300
This is your home.

41:18.366 --> 41:21.366
You're a misfit.
You belong with us.

41:21.433 --> 41:23.733
Nobody else will have you.

41:30.900 --> 41:33.400
Oh, thank you, thank you,
thank you, thank you.

41:43.600 --> 41:45.800
I'm even glad
to see this stupid thing.

41:54.700 --> 41:56.866
Wear and make mom happy.

42:05.166 --> 42:07.300
Oh, boy.

42:08.566 --> 42:10.366
Hope she appreciates this.

42:16.366 --> 42:19.066
Oh, see, I told you
that dress was you.

42:19.133 --> 42:21.200
Now you look like
my daughter.

42:34.500 --> 42:36.266
I am your daughter, mom.

42:36.333 --> 42:37.566
Right?

42:39.366 --> 42:41.933
I mean, you'd tell me
if I wasn't, right?

42:42.000 --> 42:43.100
Of course, dear.

42:46.600 --> 42:49.200
It's just that,
sometimes I feel so strange.

42:50.433 --> 42:52.000
Like I am a misfit.

42:52.833 --> 42:54.533
You'll get used to it.

42:54.600 --> 42:56.733
Used to what?

42:56.800 --> 42:59.033
I'm not a misfit.

43:00.866 --> 43:02.200
Of course, dear.

43:09.966 --> 43:12.266
Mom, I'm sorry
I'm acting so weird.

43:13.500 --> 43:15.833
I just found out
my friend John moved away.

43:16.766 --> 43:18.000
Kinda suddenly.

43:20.766 --> 43:23.333
See, he knew he was adopted.

43:23.400 --> 43:26.266
'So, I guess he was taken away
by his real parents.'

43:29.266 --> 43:30.533
I miss him.

43:32.866 --> 43:35.733
You'd miss me
if I was taken away, right?

43:38.400 --> 43:40.166
Welcome home.

43:40.233 --> 43:43.100
To stay forever
and ever and ever.

43:43.166 --> 43:45.366
You had your chance.

43:45.433 --> 43:46.466
But you won't return.

43:46.533 --> 43:49.966
Now you're back
with your own kind.

44:03.700 --> 44:07.266
Come out, come out,
misfit child.

44:31.266 --> 44:33.400
You're not my mother.

44:34.166 --> 44:36.133
You never were.

44:37.233 --> 44:39.633
Now you never will be here.

44:50.033 --> 44:51.333
'Christina?'

44:52.966 --> 44:54.700
'Come on, sweety.'

44:54.766 --> 44:58.233
I want you to meet
your foster parents.

44:58.300 --> 45:00.866
Oh, I'm afraid it's been
really hard on her.

45:02.166 --> 45:05.533
Her mother died
in an accidental fire.

45:05.600 --> 45:08.100
Destroyed their home.

45:08.166 --> 45:10.833
And there are
no living relatives.

45:10.900 --> 45:14.700
She was lucky that firemen found
her before it was too late.

45:14.766 --> 45:18.000
Now, she just can't
seem to accept the idea

45:18.066 --> 45:19.733
of a foster home.

45:21.066 --> 45:24.333
Kuma doo oopa shmurk.

45:24.400 --> 45:26.333
'Kuma uma dupa shmurk.'

45:29.900 --> 45:32.066
I'm waiting for my real mommy.

45:33.533 --> 45:34.700
'My real mommy.'

45:45.966 --> 45:47.833
Come on down.

45:47.900 --> 45:50.600
Worried about your credit?
I ain't.

45:50.666 --> 45:52.600
We've got every shape

45:52.666 --> 45:55.033
every size, every price.

45:55.100 --> 45:58.000
I'll make you a deal
you can't refuse.

45:58.066 --> 46:00.300
I even take trade ins.
