01:51.640 --> 01:54.060
Help me! Help me. Help me.

02:31.812 --> 02:34.182
My cake is ready.

02:43.113 --> 02:45.983
Time for the show. Everybody on stage.

05:54.172 --> 05:56.252
Ruby?

05:56.342 --> 05:59.302
Is that you?

06:01.382 --> 06:03.552
Goddamn it.

06:15.733 --> 06:17.693
Ruby?

06:29.164 --> 06:31.124
Ruby?

06:35.004 --> 06:37.004
Ruby?

07:03.655 --> 07:05.615
Ruby?

07:13.536 --> 07:17.036
If that's you, Jupiter,
I got some buckshot for you.

07:17.166 --> 07:19.086
Ya hear me?

07:32.097 --> 07:35.977
I told you, it's over!

07:36.097 --> 07:38.557
I'm out! Ya hear me?

07:39.817 --> 07:43.237
You're on your own now!

07:43.317 --> 07:46.147
I-

07:46.237 --> 07:49.278
I'm sorry,
I can't do this anymore.

08:58.101 --> 09:00.391
Hello!

09:07.851 --> 09:09.732
Hey!

09:09.862 --> 09:13.862
- Ah! It's hot out here.
- Honey, you ought to stay
in the car out of the wind.

09:13.942 --> 09:18.612
- Well, honey, I have to stretch my legs.
- Where the hell is everybody?

09:18.742 --> 09:21.872
- Hello?
- Hey.

09:21.952 --> 09:25.372
- Get up, jackass.
- Bobby!

09:30.213 --> 09:34.673
- Fill her up and check the fluids, my friend.
- Oh, yeah. Right away, sir.

09:37.723 --> 09:42.013
- Beauty, Beast, stop it!
- Ah! Ah! Damn it!

09:43.303 --> 09:45.603
You okay?

09:45.723 --> 09:49.854
Tell me again why we couldn't fly
like normal people? Oh, that's right.

09:49.984 --> 09:54.364
- They wouldn't let your dad drive the plane.
- Doug, relax, please.

09:54.484 --> 09:57.284
It's their silver anniversary,
and they're so happy you came.

09:57.404 --> 10:01.284
- Your parents can't stand me.
- Nope, you're wrong. They love you.

10:01.364 --> 10:03.324
I could have taken them
on a cruise.

10:03.414 --> 10:07.164
Hey, you know what?
Stop. I never ask you for anything, okay?

10:09.165 --> 10:12.875
Just think how happy you'll be when
Catherine comes along on our 25th, huh?

10:19.635 --> 10:23.555
Aw, it's okay.

10:23.675 --> 10:26.345
It's not gonna be
in a fucking trailer home.

10:26.475 --> 10:30.266
Don't see too many travelers around here.
Where y'all headed?

10:30.396 --> 10:33.566
- San Diego.
- California?

10:33.646 --> 10:36.486
Sure didn't take the fastest road.

10:36.566 --> 10:38.696
Oh, no. We absolutely
had to see the desert.

10:38.776 --> 10:41.156
- Didn't we, Bob?
- Absolutely.

10:41.276 --> 10:43.986
There ain't nothin'
to see in the desert.

10:44.116 --> 10:46.036
Really?
Did you hear that, honey?

10:46.116 --> 10:48.666
Yeah.

10:48.786 --> 10:51.707
Don't you know it's illegal
to smoke around a gas pump?

10:51.837 --> 10:55.587
Yeah.

10:55.667 --> 10:59.007
- Come here. Come on.
He's a good little piggy.

10:59.127 --> 11:02.927
Little baby piggy.
Little baby piggy.

11:03.047 --> 11:06.057
Hey, Bobby, come over here.
Look at this.

11:06.137 --> 11:09.768
Oh, my God.
That's so random.

11:09.888 --> 11:12.058
You two make a perfect pair.

11:14.398 --> 11:16.568
You're sweet.

11:16.688 --> 11:19.358
Yeah.

11:22.148 --> 11:25.318
Hey, what are you doing?
Don't pee there.

11:25.408 --> 11:28.238
What the hell do you care?
Just turn around for a second.

11:28.368 --> 11:32.209
Uh, hello.
Don't you see that?

11:34.459 --> 11:36.459
Geez.

11:36.579 --> 11:40.799
[ Older Woman ] She's so uncomfortable
in this heat. I told you to use cloth diapers.

11:40.919 --> 11:44.929
- Mom, the doctor said these were fine.
- Look at those little cheeks.

11:45.049 --> 11:49.179
- I know, sweetheart.
- Yes, she is. It's okay.

11:49.259 --> 11:52.270
I think she's getting hungry again.

12:00.270 --> 12:03.730
Uh, excuse me. Do you have a phone I can use?
I can't get a signal out here.

12:03.860 --> 12:06.190
No, I don't.

12:06.280 --> 12:09.110
Hey, Bukowski.
Give the cell phone a rest.

12:09.200 --> 12:11.161
Sorry, Bob. Duty calls.

12:11.241 --> 12:14.701
Honey, you've been on the phone
since we left, really.

12:14.831 --> 12:17.211
Well, sweetheart,
I've been gone two days.

12:17.331 --> 12:20.001
I have to make sure that
my store's not burning to the ground.

12:20.121 --> 12:22.421
Oh, God.

12:34.972 --> 12:37.012
What the hell, Brenda?

12:37.102 --> 12:39.062
Damn it!

12:40.812 --> 12:43.522
Damn it!
Got it all over my hand.

12:43.652 --> 12:45.562
How far are we from I-88?

12:45.652 --> 12:47.572
- Freaking perv.
- What?

12:47.652 --> 12:50.742
- You're at least five or six hours.
- You hungry, sweetie?

12:50.902 --> 12:53.493
- Why couldn't we
have gone through Santa Fe?
- It's nasty out here.

12:53.613 --> 12:58.033
- Honey, could you put a cork in it for a minute?
- Well, if I do say so myself...

12:58.163 --> 13:01.123
ma'am, your husband here's
quite right.

13:01.253 --> 13:04.623
This is the only southbound road
going to I-88. From there...

13:04.713 --> 13:08.253
you can take the 40 to California,
but it's a long, old drive.

13:08.343 --> 13:11.133
That doesn't bother me a bit.
I like to drive at night.

13:11.303 --> 13:13.674
I used to work the night patrol
for 1 5 years.

13:13.804 --> 13:15.724
Is that right? You a cop?

13:15.844 --> 13:18.644
- Well, detective.
- Not anymore, thank God.

13:18.724 --> 13:22.514
I'm starting my own, uh, security firm.

13:22.604 --> 13:24.394
You a cop too, mister?

13:24.564 --> 13:27.564
No. I'm in telecommunications.
I sell cell phones.

13:27.694 --> 13:32.155
- You won't find any customers around here.
- Yeah, no kidding.

13:32.235 --> 13:35.155
Everything's fine. Oil's okay.

13:35.235 --> 13:38.155
Beauty, come back here!

13:38.245 --> 13:41.875
Hey, buddy.
What do I owe you?

13:41.955 --> 13:44.205
Uh, $46 even.

13:44.285 --> 13:47.625
Oh, hey, Bob, here.
Let me take care of that.

13:47.755 --> 13:50.465
I can still afford the gas, Bukowski.
Keep the change, my friend.

13:50.585 --> 13:52.426
That's not what I meant.

13:52.546 --> 13:56.136
Beauty?

13:56.256 --> 13:59.306
Beauty?

14:00.976 --> 14:02.976
Beauty?

14:04.896 --> 14:07.516
Beauty? Come on, girl.

14:11.276 --> 14:13.237
Beauty?

14:14.817 --> 14:17.067
Beauty? Come on, girl.

14:19.827 --> 14:23.247
Hello?

14:25.367 --> 14:28.497
Is anyone there?

14:30.667 --> 14:32.337
Beauty!

14:44.768 --> 14:48.058
- Can I help you, miss?
- Oh, I'm sorry.

14:48.228 --> 14:52.188
It's just our dog. She just-
She got out, and she won't stay put.

14:52.358 --> 14:55.229
- Lynn, we're leaving!
- Come on, girl. Let's go.

15:03.119 --> 15:06.619
Bobby, she keeps getting out.

15:06.659 --> 15:09.789
- It's all right. I got her.
- Okay.

15:11.369 --> 15:14.630
Oh, honey? Honey?
Could you, uh, tell him to take it easy?

15:14.750 --> 15:17.260
- The heat's making me nauseous.
- Let's go!

15:17.340 --> 15:19.300
Do you need something?

15:19.380 --> 15:22.930
No, thanks.

15:23.010 --> 15:26.140
Let's go. Let's go. Let's go!

15:26.220 --> 15:28.140
Honey, we're on vacation.

15:33.811 --> 15:35.441
Yeah?

15:35.521 --> 15:38.021
You know, uh...

15:38.151 --> 15:41.531
it's not on the map,
but if you...

15:41.651 --> 15:45.911
take a left at the dirt road,
couple miles from here...

15:46.031 --> 15:48.911
it'll lead you through the hills.

15:49.031 --> 15:52.161
Probably save you
a couple ofhours.

15:52.251 --> 15:55.872
Can't miss it.
Uh, there's an old fence right in front.

15:55.962 --> 15:58.292
Well, thank you.
Thank you very much.

15:58.422 --> 16:00.592
Old fence, dirt road,
two miles.

16:00.632 --> 16:03.672
You have a safe trip.

16:03.762 --> 16:05.722
Thank you.

17:12.825 --> 17:14.785
Dad, I hate your singing.

17:17.536 --> 17:19.786
Guys, no.

17:20.996 --> 17:24.165
- Stop!
- Imagine the first people
to cross this desert.

17:24.336 --> 17:26.215
They didn't know
where they were.

17:26.336 --> 17:29.466
- Yeah, I can, because neither do we.
- Brenda, the road is here.

17:29.586 --> 17:33.136
It exists.
It's got to go somewhere.

17:33.256 --> 17:36.517
Besides, look how beautiful it is.
Look at the light on the rocks.

17:36.637 --> 17:38.517
It's gorgeous.

17:38.637 --> 17:41.227
- This is so fucked!
- Excuse me?

17:41.357 --> 17:44.477
Watch your language, young lady.

17:44.567 --> 17:46.567
I would like
a little backup here.

17:46.687 --> 17:49.647
- This is such bullshit.
- Hey, watch your fucking mouth!

17:49.697 --> 17:54.327
Can we just calm down here?
We're all a little tired, okay?

17:54.407 --> 17:58.248
Yeah, Mom. Didn't you grow up in the '60s?
Why are you so uptight?

17:58.368 --> 18:00.998
Your mom didn't
used to be uptight.

18:01.078 --> 18:04.418
- She was a little hippie chick.
- No.

18:04.538 --> 18:06.958
You should have seen her when she was
your age. She was a little hottie.

18:07.048 --> 18:10.468
- Dad.
- Stop that.

18:15.298 --> 18:19.429
Driving through the New Mexico desert
in the middle of summer...

18:19.519 --> 18:22.269
with a broken air conditioner.

18:22.309 --> 18:24.269
Great vacation.

18:24.309 --> 18:29.399
I'm glad you came because
I would have been so fucking bored otherwise.

18:29.439 --> 18:32.319
Yeah. So bored.

18:34.989 --> 18:37.450
Oh. Give up on that, man.

18:37.530 --> 18:40.580
I tried for an hour and a half.
Thing's ancient.

18:40.660 --> 18:42.620
Wiring's medieval.
Needs to be replaced.

18:42.660 --> 18:45.370
There.

18:45.500 --> 18:49.630
There.
It's just the, uh, thermostat.

18:49.710 --> 18:51.630
It's disconnected.

18:51.710 --> 18:54.880
Anyway, at least
we can breathe now.

19:00.091 --> 19:02.851
Hey, I thought you quit smoking.

19:02.931 --> 19:06.181
- Does my sister know?
- Hey, man.

19:06.351 --> 19:08.521
Fuck your sister.

19:10.561 --> 19:13.521
You know, uh, Big Bob'd
get pretty pissed off...

19:13.611 --> 19:16.732
if he found out you were smoking
in his newly renovated '88 Airstream.

19:16.862 --> 19:18.782
Yeah?

19:18.862 --> 19:20.912
Well, fuck Big Bob too.

19:20.992 --> 19:24.412
Here. Want one?
Go ahead.

19:26.792 --> 19:28.752
Uh-uh.

19:28.872 --> 19:31.332
Your sister would cut my nuts off
if you start smoking.

19:31.462 --> 19:34.002
I think she did that
a long time ago.

19:34.132 --> 19:36.092
I think you're right.

19:42.013 --> 19:44.093
I think we're somewhere
on this blue road.

19:44.183 --> 19:46.973
Mom, we're not on the blue road
or any other road.

19:47.103 --> 19:49.183
The guy said it wasn't
on the map, remember?

19:49.313 --> 19:51.183
Oh, my God!

19:56.353 --> 19:57.864
Jesus! Hang on!

20:00.984 --> 20:02.904
Watch the baby!

20:15.004 --> 20:17.374
Honey? Where's the baby?

20:17.424 --> 20:19.425
- She's right here.
- Is she okay?

20:19.465 --> 20:21.465
- She's fine. She's fine.
- What the hell happened?

20:21.545 --> 20:25.135
- The heat must have caused a blowout.
- Are you okay?

20:25.265 --> 20:28.095
Yes, I'm fine. I'm fine. I'm just a little scared.

20:28.185 --> 20:32.145
Where's Bobby? Bobby.
Are you all right, honey? Are you okay?

20:32.265 --> 20:35.185
He's all right.

20:35.315 --> 20:37.525
I knew this wasn't going
to be safe for the baby.

20:37.645 --> 20:39.986
- You okay?
- Yeah, we're okay. We're fine.

20:40.146 --> 20:43.486
Son of a bitch!

20:43.616 --> 20:46.946
- Okay, okay, we're all right.
- Oh, my God. The whole trailer.

20:47.076 --> 20:49.116
Come here, guys.
Come here.

20:49.246 --> 20:51.956
Beauty!

20:52.036 --> 20:53.996
Beast!

21:02.587 --> 21:04.507
We are so fucked.

21:11.557 --> 21:15.057
- Did you find a signal?
- No. Nothing.

21:15.137 --> 21:19.068
Ninety-seven percent nationwide coverage,
and we find ourselves in that three percent.

21:19.148 --> 21:21.608
- Yeah.
- Well, your dad wanted to see the desert.

21:21.728 --> 21:23.688
I hope he's enjoying himself.

21:23.818 --> 21:27.278
Doug, don't start.

21:27.358 --> 21:29.988
- Maybe somebody will need
a rent-a-cop around here.
- Doug!

21:30.158 --> 21:31.948
- What?
- Come on.

21:32.078 --> 21:35.868
Every chance the guy gets, he takes me
down a peg. Can't snap back at him?

21:35.958 --> 21:39.539
- Yeah, well, don't stoop to his level.
- It's my fault?

21:39.669 --> 21:42.419
200 degrees out here!
It's everybody's fault.

21:42.539 --> 21:44.919
- Don't listen to him.
- Get off my back.

21:45.009 --> 21:47.669
General, what's the damage?

21:47.799 --> 21:52.719
The axle is broken,
and it's... totaled.

21:52.849 --> 21:55.259
Can we fix it?

21:55.349 --> 21:58.139
What?

21:59.980 --> 22:02.600
No, the frame is twisted to hell.
We can't-

22:02.690 --> 22:05.230
- With what? I mean-
- There she is.

22:05.360 --> 22:07.690
Give me your damn cell phone.
I'm gonna call a tow truck.

22:07.860 --> 22:09.860
No signal. I tried.

22:10.030 --> 22:13.910
- Well, we can use the C.B.
- You can try it, but I doubt
you're gonna get anybody.

22:14.070 --> 22:18.040
The freeway's way the hell on the other side
of those hills. You won't get a signal.

22:18.200 --> 22:20.291
So, what are we gonna do?

22:22.331 --> 22:25.421
Excuse me.

22:33.261 --> 22:36.011
Bob? What are we doing?

22:39.261 --> 22:41.972
We walk.

22:42.062 --> 22:44.812
- We walk?
- Yep. You and me.

22:46.812 --> 22:51.402
We're in the middle of the desert.
We're miles from anywhere.

22:51.482 --> 22:55.362
It's either that, or we sit here
and wait for somebody to drive by.

22:55.452 --> 22:58.162
Have you seen anybody drive by
since we got off the freeway?

22:58.242 --> 23:01.203
I haven't seen anyone drive by since
you decided to take the shortcut.

23:01.283 --> 23:05.003
- Honey. Honey, let's go for a walk. Okay?
- Okay.

23:05.083 --> 23:08.083
There's nothing there,
you shitheads.

23:17.883 --> 23:20.634
There you go. Ah, good boy.

23:23.144 --> 23:27.894
I'm sure this desert is full of rattlesnakes.
Is that locked?

23:27.974 --> 23:30.024
- Bobby, come here.
- I think that's locked.

23:30.104 --> 23:32.654
- Come here.
- Yes, sir.

23:32.774 --> 23:35.614
- Thanks, honey.
- You're welcome.

23:37.114 --> 23:39.824
- You know, I saw- Mom?
- What?

23:39.944 --> 23:43.665
- Safety's on, boy.
- Yes, sir.

23:43.825 --> 23:46.745
I saw a documentary on desert snakes-

23:46.875 --> 23:49.545
On the Discovery Channel-
And there's some species...

23:49.625 --> 23:52.415
if you get bit, you can die
within like 25 minutes.

23:52.505 --> 23:55.795
Really? I'd like to see
how they stack up against this one.

23:55.925 --> 23:58.385
I thought those were gonna
stay locked up, honey.

23:58.505 --> 24:01.716
- I thought you weren't talking to me, honey.
- You're right.

24:01.846 --> 24:04.686
Relax, honey. I'm a licensed professional.

24:04.806 --> 24:07.096
Besides, I'd take my bullets
over your prayers any day.

24:07.226 --> 24:09.106
Well, some things never change.

24:09.186 --> 24:12.726
So, what about, like, uh, scorpions
and coyotes and stuff?

24:12.816 --> 24:16.356
Praise the Lord and pass the ammunition.

24:19.366 --> 24:21.447
Hey, Doug. You wanna try?

24:21.577 --> 24:24.367
- Hey, don't point that at me!
- Don't worry, man. The safety's on.

24:24.447 --> 24:26.657
- Hey, Bobby?
- Yeah?

24:26.787 --> 24:31.127
Leave Doug alone. He's a Democrat.
He doesn't believe in guns.

24:31.207 --> 24:35.587
Oh. Come on, Dougy.
Come here.Just one shot.

24:35.667 --> 24:38.127
It makes you feel kind of powerful.
You might like it.

24:38.257 --> 24:41.257
I don't think so, Bobby.
I'd probably just shoot my foot off.

24:41.338 --> 24:43.598
You know, he's right.

24:43.678 --> 24:47.098
He'd probably shoot his foot off.

24:59.778 --> 25:01.949
- Hey, "B".
- Hey.

25:02.029 --> 25:04.779
How you holding up?

25:04.819 --> 25:07.159
I am thrilled.

25:07.279 --> 25:11.289
Yeah. This is a total drag.

25:11.369 --> 25:14.669
Yeah, well, you know,
I really don't care what they say.

25:14.749 --> 25:18.129
Next year, I am going
to Cancun with my friends.

25:18.209 --> 25:20.629
Not going on any more
of these little family trips.

25:20.749 --> 25:24.050
Well, we're not gonna have
many more of them, you know?

25:24.130 --> 25:28.640
And if you want to go to Cancun,
you know you're gonna have to get a job.

25:28.720 --> 25:31.140
Oh, yeah. What, you mean
like your job?

25:32.430 --> 25:35.770
Brenda, I help Doug out
at the store, okay?

25:35.890 --> 25:38.310
Oh, yeah.

25:38.480 --> 25:40.900
Honey? Can you bring me myjacket?

25:42.731 --> 25:45.651
I'll be right there, honey.

26:09.882 --> 26:11.892
Bobby!

26:12.012 --> 26:13.762
Fucker!

26:13.892 --> 26:16.102
- Could you get me a Twinkie?
- No!

26:37.033 --> 26:38.993
-Just keep walking this direction.
- Yeah, fine.

26:39.083 --> 26:42.163
You find out where the road leads,
and I'll head back the way we came.

26:42.253 --> 26:44.794
- Stay away from me.
- All right.

26:44.924 --> 26:47.714
It's gotta lead somewhere.
Maybe back to the freeway.

26:47.754 --> 26:50.134
- Are you taking a gun too?
- No, honey, I'm not.

26:50.254 --> 26:53.344
I don't need a gun
to find help.

26:53.424 --> 26:55.934
- I don't want this.
- You need the hat.

26:56.054 --> 26:58.434
- It gives me hat head. I don't like it.
- Who cares?

26:58.514 --> 27:00.934
- It's not about fashion.
- All right. Thank you.

27:00.974 --> 27:05.145
Hey, listen. Uh, if you don't find help
within five or six miles, just come back.

27:05.275 --> 27:07.605
All right?

27:07.695 --> 27:10.365
- Here, honey.
- I'm gonna go to the gas station.

27:10.485 --> 27:13.785
You're just never gonna make it back
by sunset is the only problem.

27:13.865 --> 27:17.195
Honey, it's only about eight miles.
I'll borrow the old man's car.

27:17.285 --> 27:20.495
Use his phone, if he's got one. I'll be back
with a tow truck before nightfall.

27:20.615 --> 27:22.625
- Can I go with Doug?
- No. Nope.

27:22.705 --> 27:26.336
You stay here with your mother
and your sisters. Now, hey, uh, Brenda?

27:26.416 --> 27:28.876
Listen up. Your brother is
in charge, all right?

27:28.966 --> 27:32.386
- So don't tease him.
- I think we should pray before you go.

27:32.506 --> 27:36.426
- Oh, Mom!
- Brenda, is it really so much to ask?

27:36.556 --> 27:38.716
- Yes.
- Come on.

27:38.846 --> 27:40.726
Damn it.

27:40.846 --> 27:43.806
We're waiting.

27:43.897 --> 27:45.977
Thank God no one's watching us.

27:47.267 --> 27:49.227
- Bobby.
- Stop it, Bobby.

27:49.317 --> 27:51.897
- Stop.
- Thanks.

27:51.947 --> 27:55.067
Please bless us at this time...

27:55.197 --> 27:57.577
and send your guardian angels...

27:57.657 --> 28:01.787
to help us to walk through
this valley in our faith...

28:01.947 --> 28:04.248
this, yeah, with the help
of thy dear Lord.

28:04.328 --> 28:06.288
- Amen.
- Amen.

28:06.378 --> 28:08.878
- Okay.
- Bye, Doug. Be careful.

28:08.958 --> 28:12.008
- See you later.
- See you guys in a few hours.

28:12.168 --> 28:16.048
Honey? Keep the hat on, okay?

28:16.218 --> 28:18.718
- Am I wearing it?
- Don't give me that look.

28:18.838 --> 28:21.098
- Do you see it on my head?
- I love you.

28:21.178 --> 28:23.388
I love you too. Bye.

28:32.569 --> 28:34.479
Hi.

28:34.609 --> 28:38.449
Hi, sweetness. Hello.

28:38.529 --> 28:41.739
Who doesn't want
to sleep anymore?

28:41.819 --> 28:43.779
Are you hungry?

28:43.869 --> 28:47.700
Please take your feet
off the table. Honestly.

28:47.830 --> 28:50.500
Just because we're camping
doesn't mean you get to act like a pig.

28:50.580 --> 28:54.000
You know, honey, really...

28:54.130 --> 28:56.800
you shouldn't go
from the breast to the bottle.

28:56.920 --> 28:59.760
At her age, she should
get used to one or the other.

28:59.880 --> 29:03.760
Mom, thanks for the advice,
but she's my baby.

29:08.011 --> 29:11.521
I can't believe that we're stranded
in the middle of nowhere on your anniversary.

29:11.641 --> 29:14.601
You know, if we just stayed on the main road...

29:14.731 --> 29:16.771
we'd be in California right now.

29:16.901 --> 29:20.781
What I'd give for a hot shower
and a cold margarita.

29:20.861 --> 29:24.241
- The beach.
- A massage.

29:24.321 --> 29:26.702
- I'll take a real bed.
- Yeah.

29:26.822 --> 29:29.032
- The chronic.
- The what?

29:29.162 --> 29:31.412
Brenda!

29:31.542 --> 29:34.002
What?

29:34.122 --> 29:36.042
The chronic.
It's pot, Mom.

29:36.122 --> 29:38.962
- Whoa, whoa, whoa. Who smokes pot?
- Yes, exactly.

29:39.042 --> 29:43.422
- Who smokes pot?
- Hey, has anybody seen my red sweatshirt?

29:43.552 --> 29:47.303
You know, the hoodie thing
in the backseat? Brenda?

29:47.383 --> 29:51.723
- Weren't you sleeping on it?
- I haven't touched your smelly sweatshirt, okay?

29:51.813 --> 29:54.223
Why are the dogs so excited?

29:54.313 --> 29:57.393
There's probably some
rattlesnakes somewhere around.

29:57.523 --> 30:01.063
You know how Freud would have interpreted
your obsession with rattlesnakes, Mom?

30:01.193 --> 30:03.363
Bobby!

30:03.443 --> 30:05.483
So bad.

30:05.613 --> 30:08.074
- Bobby Carter! Stop that!
- That's gross!

30:08.204 --> 30:11.784
- That's so wrong.
- That was a little gross. I'm sorry.

30:11.914 --> 30:14.664
- I apologize to the entire table.
- Well, thank you.

30:14.784 --> 30:18.954
I'm really glad that
we all came on this trip together.

30:19.044 --> 30:22.504
Ah, well, that makes one of us.

30:24.134 --> 30:26.505
- Where is the, uh, fruit?
- Does anyone need anything?

30:26.595 --> 30:30.425
No.

30:30.515 --> 30:33.185
- Hey. Hey. Brenda!
- Wonderful.

30:33.305 --> 30:35.395
- Are you kidding me? Do you know how long-
- Bobby.

30:35.515 --> 30:37.435
- Bobby?
- Sorry.

30:37.515 --> 30:40.525
Bobby, it's dinnertime.

30:40.605 --> 30:42.645
- I'll get him, Mom. Bobby!
- This always happens.

30:42.735 --> 30:46.656
Bobby, I don't want you going
away from the trailer right now.

30:48.066 --> 30:49.986
Beauty!

30:59.376 --> 31:01.336
Beauty!

33:10.413 --> 33:12.373
Fuck!

35:36.970 --> 35:38.810
What the hell?

36:27.232 --> 36:29.152
Look at that.

38:01.657 --> 38:03.697
Hello?

38:09.957 --> 38:11.877
Hey, buddy.

38:23.598 --> 38:27.928
Hello?

38:34.769 --> 38:37.399
Hello!

38:48.869 --> 38:52.829
Hey, uh, I had a bit of a wreck
out on your, uh, shortcut.

38:55.630 --> 38:57.590
Yo!

39:03.630 --> 39:07.220
I grabbed some water, all right?

39:07.340 --> 39:09.850
Uh-

39:12.520 --> 39:16.641
It's dead. Damn it.

39:16.731 --> 39:19.941
Yo, my friend! Hey!

39:20.021 --> 39:22.401
You here?

39:22.521 --> 39:24.611
You home?

39:57.353 --> 39:59.933
Hello?

41:15.136 --> 41:18.177
Weird son of a bitch.

41:29.607 --> 41:31.567
Yeah.

41:37.238 --> 41:39.238
Jupiter!

41:41.498 --> 41:44.868
I got buckshot, ya hear?

41:44.958 --> 41:47.498
Hey, mister.

41:50.418 --> 41:53.838
You don't understand
what's going on here.

41:58.139 --> 42:00.259
The kids...

42:00.349 --> 42:04.639
grew up in the mines
like wild animals.

42:04.769 --> 42:06.729
Open the door, slowly!

42:10.479 --> 42:13.319
What kind of place
is that for children?

42:14.479 --> 42:17.450
What kind of a place is that?

42:17.530 --> 42:22.410
Okay. Put the weapon down.
Put it down, easy. Put it down.

42:24.530 --> 42:28.370
I did the best I could.
I'm sorry.

42:33.080 --> 42:36.380
Daddy.

42:37.461 --> 42:39.421
Daddy.

43:30.223 --> 43:33.353
Would you give me that gun, Pluto!

43:33.473 --> 43:35.523
- Give me the gosh darn gun!
- Get on over here!

43:35.603 --> 43:38.644
That's right. Come on.
You oughtn't have a gun.

43:55.704 --> 43:58.085
Brenda?

44:05.005 --> 44:06.715
Brenda!

44:06.805 --> 44:10.175
Hey, I'm here!
I'll be back in a minute!

44:12.725 --> 44:14.595
Bobby!

44:14.685 --> 44:16.935
Bobby!

44:55.217 --> 44:58.808
Okay, let me just-
Oh, honey, the hair.

44:58.938 --> 45:01.018
It's just-

45:01.148 --> 45:03.978
You know, you really are so lucky
that Brenda found you.

45:04.108 --> 45:08.738
I mean, what if you'd had to spend
the whole night out there in the cold?

45:10.488 --> 45:15.278
Hey, Bobby. Don't worry. Beauty will
come back when she's hungry, okay?

45:18.158 --> 45:21.329
- Did you- Did you try the radio?
- It doesn't work.

45:21.459 --> 45:25.839
But we heard something.
Some sort of breathing.

45:25.919 --> 45:28.709
What breathing?

45:28.839 --> 45:31.089
It was weird.
Right, Mom? I-

45:31.169 --> 45:33.469
I'm sure it was just static.

45:33.549 --> 45:38.509
Mom! It sounded like
a perverted call.

45:38.639 --> 45:42.520
Only Mom would get
an obscene phone call out here.

45:42.600 --> 45:46.520
Bobby! What-

45:46.610 --> 45:50.360
- Honey?
- No, no, no, no! I want you guys to stay here.

45:55.240 --> 45:57.530
What is wrong with him?

46:05.871 --> 46:08.121
What's he doing?

46:20.472 --> 46:22.472
Shit.

46:26.312 --> 46:28.772
Beast! Beast!

46:28.852 --> 46:30.772
- Hey, Bobby.
-Jesus Christ!

46:30.902 --> 46:35.152
Hey! Whoa, whoa!
Stop pointing the gun at me! Please!

46:35.272 --> 46:38.692
-Jesus, Bobby!
- Doug, I'm sorry, man.

46:38.822 --> 46:42.323
It's me! You okay?

46:42.413 --> 46:46.033
- Yeah.
- God!

46:46.123 --> 46:48.333
- Didn't mean to startle you, man.
- Yeah, I know. I just-

46:48.453 --> 46:52.623
Look, I found this place out here.
You wouldn't believe it. It's like the Twilight Zone.

46:52.713 --> 46:54.633
- Hey.
- Is that Bob?

46:54.753 --> 46:56.633
- It's Doug. It's okay.
- Ta-da!

46:56.713 --> 47:01.094
Honey! Oh, my God! Thank God you're okay.
I was so worried about you.

47:01.224 --> 47:04.724
- No, I'm fine.Just exhausted. Look.
- Yeah.

47:04.804 --> 47:06.724
Look at all this stuff
I found.

47:06.804 --> 47:09.184
There's a huge crater out there.

47:09.264 --> 47:13.104
People must use it as a dump site.
I've never seen anything like it in my life.

47:13.234 --> 47:15.104
- What are-
- Look at this stuff. It's brand new.

47:15.234 --> 47:17.364
What are we gonna do with
a fishing pole in the desert?

47:17.484 --> 47:21.195
- I thought you went to go find somebody.
- Road dead-ends in five miles.

47:21.325 --> 47:23.825
That's where the crater is.
It's not a shortcut. It's just desert.

47:23.945 --> 47:25.865
- It dead-ends?
- Dead end.

47:25.995 --> 47:28.785
- I knew that old man was full of shit.
- Hope your dad did better.

47:28.915 --> 47:30.835
Maybe wejust missed a turn.

47:30.915 --> 47:33.875
- Honey, did you guys cook
any dinner? I'm starving.
- Yeah. Come on inside.

47:34.005 --> 47:37.045
- Great. Thanks. Brenda?
- Yeah?

47:37.125 --> 47:39.135
Do you have that lip balm?
My lips are really dry.

47:39.175 --> 47:42.256
Are you serious? That's gross.
I'm not letting you use my lip balm.

47:42.386 --> 47:45.216
Do you use it
without telling me?

48:05.987 --> 48:09.037
Wait. Bobby. Don't close that door.
We're leaving in a second.

48:09.117 --> 48:12.117
- What?
- Get some rest for Daddy.

48:12.247 --> 48:14.127
You guys aren't gonna wait
till Dad gets back?

48:14.247 --> 48:18.127
No, Bobby, I'm exhausted.
I need to get some sleep.

48:18.247 --> 48:21.217
No, no, no. It's fine.
You'll be more comfortable here.

48:21.297 --> 48:24.048
I'll sleep on the floor, and Mom and Brenda
are gonna be up front.

48:24.178 --> 48:27.508
And you and Lynn can take the back.
We got extra sleeping bags.

48:27.638 --> 48:30.308
Bobby, you got six people sleeping
in a three-person trailer.

48:30.388 --> 48:34.728
It's not comfortable.
It's a little bit weird. Okay?

48:34.808 --> 48:37.978
- Honey, you gonna bring the water?
- Yeah.

48:39.768 --> 48:43.319
- Hey, hey, hey. Doug, Doug. Can I talk to you?
- What's up?

48:43.439 --> 48:46.659
- Baby, you coming?
- I'm almost ready.

48:46.739 --> 48:49.159
- See, uh-
- What's going on?

48:49.239 --> 48:53.329
- Uh, when I-
- Bobby.

48:53.449 --> 48:55.749
- No, no, no, no. It's-
- Bobby, hey.

48:55.869 --> 48:58.619
I'm sure your dad's gonna
be back soon. Okay?

48:58.709 --> 49:02.380
I mean, come on.
He's Big Bob, all right?

49:02.460 --> 49:06.550
I'm sure it's gonna take more than snakes
and scorpions in the night to stop him.

49:06.630 --> 49:08.930
- Okay?
- Excuse me.

49:09.090 --> 49:11.340
- Sorry.
- Did you get pillows?

49:12.640 --> 49:14.890
They're in the S.U.V.

49:16.810 --> 49:18.730
Hey, hey, listen.

49:18.810 --> 49:22.190
If he's not back by midnight,
we'll both go looking for him. Deal?

49:22.310 --> 49:24.521
- Yeah. Deal.
- Okay.

49:24.651 --> 49:26.941
- Get some rest, man.
- Good night, Bobby.

49:27.031 --> 49:29.691
Good night.

49:29.821 --> 49:32.951
What are you doing?
There's no mosquitoes in the desert.

49:33.031 --> 49:35.121
Honey, there's
mosquitoes everywhere.

49:38.291 --> 49:40.251
Hi.

50:48.855 --> 50:51.485
Beast.

50:54.525 --> 50:56.525
Beast?

51:58.628 --> 52:01.428
Beast? Come here, boy.

52:38.590 --> 52:40.300
Hey. Guys! Guys!

52:40.420 --> 52:42.840
- Oh, good God. What-
- Jesus!

52:42.920 --> 52:45.721
- Bobby.
- What is it, Bobby?

52:45.841 --> 52:49.891
- Guys, something- something
is going on around here, okay?
- What is it?

52:49.971 --> 52:52.641
There-There are, like, people
or something living in those hills.

52:52.721 --> 52:55.101
- People? Bobby.
- No, no, no, no. Doug.

52:55.181 --> 52:57.901
- Doug. Doug. Please.
- Bobby. Bobby, listen to me!

52:58.021 --> 53:02.191
We're in the middle of nowhere, okay?
Nobody lives in those hills.

53:02.231 --> 53:04.481
- Beauty's dead.
- What?

53:04.571 --> 53:08.702
I found her,
and, uh, she was, like-

53:08.862 --> 53:12.372
- It looked like somebody cut her open, you know?
- Cut her open?

53:12.452 --> 53:15.292
Yeah, and I-I didn't want
to say anything...

53:15.412 --> 53:19.332
because I didn't want to scare everyone
and I didn't want to get Mom upset.

53:19.422 --> 53:24.752
But I'm telling you, there is something
going on, okay? And Dad's not even back yet.

53:24.882 --> 53:28.923
Okay. All right. Stay right there.
I'll come check this out.

53:31.303 --> 53:33.433
- We're not alone.
- All right, Lynn.

53:33.553 --> 53:35.933
You stay here,
you lock the car, okay?

53:36.063 --> 53:39.773
Calm down, man. We're gonna check this out.
Now where did you see this?

53:39.893 --> 53:42.813
Now!

53:49.984 --> 53:51.904
It's Bob.

53:51.994 --> 53:54.574
- Wait. We don't know what that is.
- It's Bob!

53:54.744 --> 53:57.124
- We don't know what that is!
- Bob!

53:57.204 --> 54:00.454
Dad? Dad!

54:00.544 --> 54:02.704
Brenda. Watch the baby!

54:30.816 --> 54:32.446
No!

55:00.517 --> 55:02.847
Hey, little birdie.
Hey, little birdie.

55:25.748 --> 55:29.629
Get off!. Get your mother out of here!
Get your mother out of here!

55:31.799 --> 55:33.259
Doug! Do something!

55:43.099 --> 55:46.269
Move! You gotta be
a man to do that!

55:52.400 --> 55:56.820
I told you to move!
So, move!

56:00.070 --> 56:02.990
Now, get! Get!

56:14.251 --> 56:17.711
What you got under there?
That's it. Give it to me. Whoo! Whoo!

56:17.801 --> 56:19.841
Fuck off!

56:19.921 --> 56:22.341
Come on. Yeah!

57:18.894 --> 57:21.444
It's not my Bob!
It's not my Bob!

57:21.564 --> 57:24.984
Come on, Mom. No! Let's go.
No, just come on.

57:25.114 --> 57:28.154
It's not my Bob.

57:28.244 --> 57:30.825
What was that?

57:30.995 --> 57:34.125
Mom, just stay here, okay?

57:38.295 --> 57:41.425
Help! Help! Help!

57:46.505 --> 57:49.595
Oh, you fat.

57:49.675 --> 57:52.266
Oh. Big, fat...

57:52.436 --> 57:54.806
and juicy.

58:12.367 --> 58:14.537
No. No, please!

58:32.348 --> 58:34.928
Bobby!
Bobby, where you going?

58:35.018 --> 58:37.018
Fucking kill those motherfuckers!

58:37.098 --> 58:40.648
Get back here! Don't do something stupid!

58:47.108 --> 58:50.568
No. No.

59:39.031 --> 59:41.621
Get back to the trailer!

01:00:04.512 --> 01:00:06.602
Come on!
Get out the door!

01:00:06.682 --> 01:00:08.942
Help! Shoot him! Shoot him!

01:00:09.022 --> 01:00:11.692
- Brenda!
- Bobby!

01:00:11.812 --> 01:00:14.943
Come on, now.
Look at me. Look at me.

01:00:15.023 --> 01:00:18.243
That's it. Look at me.

01:00:18.363 --> 01:00:22.453
Shit! I'll come back for ya.

01:00:22.493 --> 01:00:24.913
Brenda!

01:00:26.203 --> 01:00:28.163
Bitch stuck me like a pig!

01:00:42.764 --> 01:00:46.344
Are you okay?
Are you okay?

01:01:05.245 --> 01:01:07.285
No.

01:01:11.995 --> 01:01:14.706
Oh, God!

01:01:14.836 --> 01:01:17.376
Don't move! Don't move, honey. Don't move.

01:01:17.466 --> 01:01:19.926
Okay. Okay. All right.
You're gonna be okay.

01:01:20.006 --> 01:01:23.596
You're gonna be okay. S-Sweetheart?

01:01:23.636 --> 01:01:25.926
Okay.

01:01:26.056 --> 01:01:29.386
Honey? Sweetheart?

01:01:30.516 --> 01:01:33.227
Lynn, come on!

01:01:33.357 --> 01:01:36.147
Lynn!

01:01:37.527 --> 01:01:40.197
Come on!

01:02:46.210 --> 01:02:49.220
Okay.

01:02:49.380 --> 01:02:51.050
What are we gonna do? Huh?
What are we-

01:02:51.050 --> 01:02:52.140
What are we gonna do? Huh?
What are we-

01:02:52.180 --> 01:02:54.851
What are we gonna do
if they come back, Doug?

01:03:01.691 --> 01:03:05.521
This trailer is so small.
I clean and clean.

01:03:05.651 --> 01:03:07.531
It's still a mess.

01:03:07.651 --> 01:03:09.691
It's a mess.

01:03:11.901 --> 01:03:16.082
- Is Big Bob home?
- Not yet.

01:03:18.242 --> 01:03:22.292
Every- Everybody went to bed?

01:03:22.412 --> 01:03:24.292
- Yes?
- Yeah.

01:03:24.422 --> 01:03:27.632
Brenda's right here,
and Bobby's in the back.

01:03:29.252 --> 01:03:31.592
Is Lynny sleeping? Hmm?

01:03:36.263 --> 01:03:38.643
You need anything?

01:03:38.763 --> 01:03:40.893
- A blanket.
- Okay.

01:03:41.023 --> 01:03:42.933
- It's cold.
- Okay.

01:03:43.023 --> 01:03:47.563
- It's cold.
- Shh. Shh. Nice and warm, huh? Nice and warm.

01:03:57.784 --> 01:04:00.204
You're so sweet, Doug.

01:04:01.624 --> 01:04:06.584
I understand why Lynny
loves you so much.

01:04:06.664 --> 01:04:08.754
So-

01:04:20.345 --> 01:04:22.305
I'm not gonna take this shit.

01:04:22.395 --> 01:04:25.975
- Hey, we're not going anywhere!
You wanna die too?
- I don't fucking care!

01:04:26.105 --> 01:04:29.065
You wanna die, huh?
Look what they did to your mother!

01:04:29.185 --> 01:04:31.815
Look what they did to your sister!
Huh? You stop and think!

01:04:31.895 --> 01:04:34.985
You're not a fucking child anymore!
You won't make it three feet out there.

01:04:35.115 --> 01:04:38.236
We need a plan.
We need to think.

01:04:38.326 --> 01:04:40.326
- We need-We need to think.
- Think about what?

01:04:40.406 --> 01:04:42.286
Think about what, Doug?
They have Catherine!

01:04:42.406 --> 01:04:45.326
They have your daughter.
And you're just gonna sit here and do nothing?

01:04:45.376 --> 01:04:47.666
That's 'cause you're a fucking pussy
just like my dad said!

01:04:47.746 --> 01:04:51.046
- Shut the fuck up! You shut up! Shut your mouth!
- Fuck you.

01:04:55.006 --> 01:04:58.007
No! Turn the lights on.

01:04:58.097 --> 01:05:00.557
Turn the lights on.
Turn the lights on.

01:05:00.637 --> 01:05:04.807
- He said he's coming back!
- Shh! Quiet!

01:05:04.887 --> 01:05:07.557
He said he's coming back
for me. Please.

01:05:10.767 --> 01:05:13.857
It's them! It's them!
It's them!

01:05:20.698 --> 01:05:23.738
Goggle? Goggle?

01:06:10.040 --> 01:06:13.460
Goggle? You copy, Goggle?

01:06:15.500 --> 01:06:18.421
Where's Goggle?

01:06:18.501 --> 01:06:22.091
He stayed back there.
He's keeping an eye on them.

01:06:22.171 --> 01:06:26.641
- I told you.
- What?

01:06:26.721 --> 01:06:31.931
I told you,
you've gotta kill them all!

01:06:50.622 --> 01:06:53.532
Beast! Beast! You're alive!

01:06:53.662 --> 01:06:57.663
Oh, good boy.
Good boy. Good boy.

01:06:57.793 --> 01:07:00.793
- Good boy.
- Oh, my God.

01:07:00.873 --> 01:07:04.503
Jupiter's going to finish them off.

01:07:04.633 --> 01:07:06.673
Why are you doing this to us?

01:07:06.803 --> 01:07:10.973
Why are you doing this?
You hear me?

01:07:11.053 --> 01:07:12.973
Give me back my baby!

01:07:16.183 --> 01:07:18.974
What the fuck
do you want from us?

01:07:19.064 --> 01:07:22.524
What do you want?

01:07:22.644 --> 01:07:24.864
You give me back my little girl.
You hear me?

01:07:40.125 --> 01:07:44.335
- Bobby?
- Hmm?

01:07:44.415 --> 01:07:46.335
How many bullets
do you have left?

01:07:46.425 --> 01:07:48.795
A clip and a half.

01:07:50.255 --> 01:07:52.215
What are we doing?

01:08:06.316 --> 01:08:10.566
Which way, Beast? Which way?
Come on. Follow the trail.

01:08:55.408 --> 01:08:57.618
Come on, big guy.
I hope you're not afraid of the dark.

01:08:57.618 --> 01:08:59.328
Come on, big guy.
I hope you're not afraid of the dark.

01:09:38.149 --> 01:09:40.111
Where are they, boy?

01:10:49.844 --> 01:10:51.684
Which way, Beast?

01:11:02.195 --> 01:11:04.155
Good boy.

01:11:42.527 --> 01:11:44.447
Bobby?

01:11:44.527 --> 01:11:48.197
Bobby, I followed the blood trail.

01:11:48.277 --> 01:11:53.407
It leads to a town or something
out here. Bobby?

01:12:51.970 --> 01:12:54.840
Who knows?
Maybe someone heard our calls.

01:12:54.970 --> 01:12:57.680
Nobody's gonna hear
the fucking calls, Brenda!

01:12:57.810 --> 01:13:00.220
Nobody's gonna see the goddamn smoke
in this goddamn desert!

01:13:00.310 --> 01:13:03.691
We're in the middle of freakin'-
Ah, shit!

01:13:03.811 --> 01:13:07.151
God!

01:13:15.071 --> 01:13:16.991
I'm sorry.

01:13:25.792 --> 01:13:27.962
I'm so scared.

01:13:28.042 --> 01:13:30.172
Who are these people?

01:16:56.282 --> 01:16:58.622
Good dog. Stay.

01:18:01.185 --> 01:18:03.685
- Did you push her?
- Yes

01:18:03.765 --> 01:18:05.815
- Did you destroy the furniture?
- No.

01:18:05.895 --> 01:18:08.896
Did you call her
trailer park trash?

01:18:15.486 --> 01:18:19.536
- So, now, you're saying you still-
- I'm still in love with her.

01:18:19.576 --> 01:18:21.956
Okay, but-So, you said
you treasured the marriage...

01:18:22.076 --> 01:18:25.286
and you wanted to end it
two weeks after you got into it?

01:18:25.416 --> 01:18:27.376
I wanted to end it
because I have-

01:18:27.456 --> 01:18:29.957
I had a feeling that things
weren't gonna work together.

01:18:30.087 --> 01:18:33.667
She wasn't working as a team player
with me, and I tried coaching her-

01:18:33.757 --> 01:18:35.887
- What were you doing coaching her?
- Well, I tried to show-

01:18:35.927 --> 01:18:38.427
- Is she your child?
- No, she's not my child, but she-

01:18:38.507 --> 01:18:40.927
Shh, shh, shh.

01:18:43.057 --> 01:18:45.097
She wanted me
to eat dinner-spaghetti-

01:18:45.267 --> 01:18:47.557
and I wanted to do it
before it got cold.

01:19:51.121 --> 01:19:53.331
Watch her head, Bobby.

01:20:03.921 --> 01:20:05.841
Come on.

01:23:42.512 --> 01:23:45.682
Where's my daughter?
Where is she?

01:23:45.762 --> 01:23:48.932
Answer me!

01:23:49.062 --> 01:23:52.483
I don't know where she is.

01:23:52.563 --> 01:23:56.813
I never leave this place.

01:23:59.693 --> 01:24:04.113
Your people asked our families...

01:24:04.203 --> 01:24:06.283
to leave their town...

01:24:06.363 --> 01:24:11.043
and you destroyed our homes.

01:24:11.163 --> 01:24:15.924
We went into the mines.

01:24:16.044 --> 01:24:20.504
You set off your bombs...

01:24:20.634 --> 01:24:23.384
and turned everything to ashes.

01:24:25.014 --> 01:24:29.974
You made us what we've become.

01:24:31.684 --> 01:24:35.645
Boom. Boom. Boom!

01:24:35.855 --> 01:24:38.275
Where's my baby?

01:24:38.395 --> 01:24:41.365
What's so funny?

01:24:43.405 --> 01:24:46.155
It's breakfast time!

01:28:51.687 --> 01:28:53.607
Please don't kill me.

01:28:53.727 --> 01:28:57.108
"Please don't kill me."

01:28:57.188 --> 01:29:01.238
- Please don't kill me.
- "Please don't kill me. "

01:30:32.242 --> 01:30:35.622
Lizard.

01:30:35.702 --> 01:30:37.662
Kill the baby.

01:31:33.925 --> 01:31:38.015
Baby. Baby.

01:31:57.406 --> 01:32:00.447
Get out of the way, Ruby.

01:32:00.577 --> 01:32:04.457
I said get. Now, get!

01:32:16.757 --> 01:32:20.308
Mister, would you play with us?

01:32:42.909 --> 01:32:45.539
Ruby!

01:32:54.419 --> 01:32:56.959
Catherine!

01:33:01.760 --> 01:33:04.050
It's okay.

01:33:11.640 --> 01:33:14.560
It's okay.
We'll be all right.
