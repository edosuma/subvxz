<b>"Thank you for coming.</b>

02:04.280 --> 02:05.960
<b>I really appreciate it.</b>

02:07.360 --> 02:09.120
<b>But I can't see you right now.</b>

<b>Meanwhile...</b>

02:38.280 --> 02:39.390
<b>I'm home.</b>

02:41.570 --> 02:44.850
<b>Well, no one's around.</b>

02:46.630 --> 02:47.850
<b>Welcome back.</b>

02:48.430 --> 02:51.600
<b>How did work go?</b>

02:52.460 --> 02:53.450
<b>Fine.</b>

02:53.940 --> 02:57.110
<b>Does that mean you dispatched your target?</b>

02:57.570 --> 03:01.940
<b>I'm sure you were watching me 
from a distance.</b>

03:03.680 --> 03:06.020
<b>Mom's waiting for you inside.</b>

03:06.660 --> 03:07.990
<b>I don't want to see her.</b>

03:08.340 --> 03:09.750
<b>Ah.</b>

03:51.290 --> 03:52.960
<b>Did you need something?</b>

03:54.390 --> 03:56.250
<b>I wanted to say hello.</b>

03:57.010 --> 03:58.170
<b>Are you new here?</b>

03:58.820 --> 03:59.810
<b>Yes.</b>

03:59.810 --> 04:03.810
<b>While you were away, 
I was hired as an apprentice butler.</b>

04:03.810 --> 04:05.180
<b>My name is Canary.</b>

04:05.570 --> 04:07.290
<b>Here. You can have this.</b>

04:07.290 --> 04:08.380
<b>No, thank you.</b>

04:08.380 --> 04:10.920
<b>But I appreciate the thought, Killua-sama.</b>

04:10.920 --> 04:13.690
<b>Don't be so formal. Just call me Killua.</b>

04:14.050 --> 04:15.720
<b>I cannot do that.</b>

04:15.720 --> 04:17.710
<b>I am a servant.</b>

04:17.710 --> 04:19.790
<b>And you are my employer.</b>

04:20.900 --> 04:23.260
<b>Tsk... That's lame.</b>

04:29.800 --> 04:32.340
<b>You were using the Shadow Step, right?</b>

04:32.340 --> 04:33.330
<b>Shadow Step?</b>

04:33.750 --> 04:38.340
<b>The technique where you move silently,
so you won't be noticed.</b>

04:38.870 --> 04:43.210
<b>It's one of the first assassination 
techniques we learn</b>

04:43.210 --> 04:45.090
<b>in the Zoldyck family.</b>

04:45.090 --> 04:47.140
<b>Is that so?</b>

04:47.140 --> 04:51.970
<b>I must have learned it while 
growing up in Meteor City.</b>

04:53.110 --> 04:54.480
<b>Meteor City?</b>

04:56.260 --> 04:57.860
<b>My hometown.</b>

04:59.330 --> 05:02.030
<b>It's a city that has been erased from this world.</b>

05:02.570 --> 05:05.430
<b>Huh, never heard of it.</b>

05:05.430 --> 05:09.060
<b>You're allowed to dump anything in Meteor City.</b>

05:09.060 --> 05:10.440
<b>That's why many members</b>

05:10.440 --> 05:14.600
<b>of the mafia and the Phantom 
Troupe come from there.</b>

05:15.390 --> 05:17.040
<b>I'd like to visit some time.</b>

05:17.550 --> 05:20.430
<b>When you visit, I can serve as your guide.</b>

05:29.330 --> 05:30.930
<b>I'll teach you the Rhythm Echo.</b>

05:31.490 --> 05:33.890
<b>Rhythm Echo?</b>

05:34.290 --> 05:36.190
<b>It's a technique that utilizes the Shadow Step.</b>

05:45.810 --> 05:49.450
<b>You move at a certain rhythm, 
creating afterimages.</b>

05:49.820 --> 05:51.410
<b>I see...</b>

05:54.000 --> 05:56.070
<b>It appears we have intruders.</b>

05:56.070 --> 05:57.640
<b>Many intruders.</b>

05:58.130 --> 06:00.090
<b>Let Mike handle it.</b>

06:00.090 --> 06:03.710
<b>The master has ordered that 
Mike be restrained today.</b>

06:04.470 --> 06:07.720
<b>They wish to test my abilities.</b>

06:14.720 --> 06:18.840
<b>We'll split up and look for their mansion.</b>

06:23.560 --> 06:25.280
<b>Leave.</b>

06:25.790 --> 06:27.780
<b>Who are you?</b>

06:28.430 --> 06:30.250
<b>There is no need for me to answer that question.</b>

06:30.720 --> 06:33.100
<b>You are trespassing on private property.</b>

06:33.660 --> 06:36.790
<b>I cannot allow you to pass without permission.</b>

06:38.160 --> 06:40.790
<b>Can you stop us?</b>

06:41.550 --> 06:44.610
<b>It's obvious that you stand no chance.</b>

06:44.610 --> 06:49.050
<b>Well, if you don't resist, we'll spare your life.</b>

06:49.640 --> 06:51.880
<b>If you take one step past this line,</b>

06:51.880 --> 06:53.800
<b>I shall use force to remove you.</b>

06:53.800 --> 06:55.560
<b>What was that?</b>

06:55.970 --> 06:58.060
<b>You can stand back and watch, boss...</b>

06:58.060 --> 07:00.440
<b>We'll take care of this.</b>

07:00.440 --> 07:01.650
<b>Let's go!</b>

07:02.330 --> 07:04.150
<b>Don't mock us!</b>

07:23.080 --> 07:24.040
<b>Bitch!</b>

07:24.040 --> 07:25.210
<b>Get her!</b>

07:47.540 --> 07:48.820
<b>Do you wish to continue?</b>

07:49.420 --> 07:53.540
<b><i>After all that, she hasn't 
even broken a sweat...</i></b>

07:54.670 --> 07:57.200
<b>Are you a member of the Zoldyck family?</b>

07:57.750 --> 07:59.510
<b>Hardly.</b>

07:59.510 --> 08:01.970
<b>I am but an apprentice butler.</b>

08:01.970 --> 08:04.120
<b>With your abilities,</b>

08:04.120 --> 08:06.420
<b>you're not even a match for the butlers,</b>

08:06.420 --> 08:08.880
<b>let alone the Zoldyck family.</b>

08:14.970 --> 08:16.350
<b>A futile effort...</b>

08:24.440 --> 08:26.430
<b>I'm telling you that it's useless!</b>

08:48.440 --> 08:50.090
<b>As a Hunter,</b>

08:50.090 --> 08:53.970
<b>I cannot allow a little girl 
like you to defeat me.</b>

08:59.970 --> 09:01.560
<b>Prepare yourself!</b>

09:06.240 --> 09:07.060
<b>What?</b>

09:11.750 --> 09:13.490
<b>Die!</b>

09:30.740 --> 09:32.510
<b>I-I'm sorry!</b>

09:32.510 --> 09:34.460
<b>Please spare my life!</b>

09:34.460 --> 09:35.510
<b>Zebro-san...</b>

09:35.930 --> 09:38.110
<b>You noticed my presence?</b>

09:38.110 --> 09:40.680
<b>Could you clean this up?</b>

09:40.680 --> 09:43.770
<b>Sure, that's my job.</b>

09:44.270 --> 09:46.830
<b>Plus, Mike is starving.</b>

09:48.820 --> 09:49.710
<b>Huh?</b>

09:53.630 --> 09:57.030
<b>H-Help!</b>

10:08.120 --> 10:10.720
<b>You already knew the Rhythm Echo.</b>

10:10.720 --> 10:13.550
<b>Yes... Forgive me.</b>

10:15.580 --> 10:17.800
<b>You think you're stronger than I am.</b>

10:18.380 --> 10:20.020
<b>Absolutely not.</b>

10:20.020 --> 10:21.250
<b>Really?</b>

10:22.170 --> 10:25.240
<b>So, I don't have anyone to play with.</b>

10:27.370 --> 10:30.310
<b>Will you be my friend, Canary?</b>

10:46.550 --> 10:49.650
<b>I apologize, Killua-sama.</b>

10:50.290 --> 10:52.550
<b>Tsk. Lame...</b>

10:58.100 --> 11:00.220
<b><i>Let's be friends!</i></b>

11:09.580 --> 11:10.570
<b>Gon...</b>

11:12.060 --> 11:22.160
<b>Hunter Vocabulary</b>

11:18.110 --> 11:22.160
<b>Canary</b>

11:29.530 --> 11:30.930
<b>Is she okay?</b>

11:31.420 --> 11:32.170
<b>Yeah.</b>

11:32.730 --> 11:34.260
<b>She's only unconscious.</b>

11:42.970 --> 11:44.050
<b>Wake up!</b>

11:48.150 --> 11:50.430
<b>Oh. Morning, Bro.</b>

11:51.000 --> 11:52.190
<b>What time is it?</b>

11:53.790 --> 11:55.690
<b>Don't be too arrogant, Kil!</b>

11:56.120 --> 11:57.410
<b>What?</b>

11:57.410 --> 12:01.250
<b>I feel really bad about stabbing you, Bro.</b>

12:01.250 --> 12:04.200
<b>Sorry. It was the wrong thing to do, Bro.</b>

12:04.470 --> 12:06.240
<b>You're lying!</b>

12:12.300 --> 12:13.920
<b>You can tell?</b>

12:17.120 --> 12:17.970
<b>Tsk!</b>

12:19.570 --> 12:20.840
<b>Hello?</b>

12:20.840 --> 12:22.650
<b>Oh, Mama?</b>

12:22.650 --> 12:23.680
<b>Uh-huh.</b>

12:25.120 --> 12:27.500
<b>Yep, I understand.</b>

12:28.490 --> 12:30.080
<b>Kil,</b>

12:30.080 --> 12:35.190
<b>your friends are near the butler's office.</b>

12:36.370 --> 12:38.310
<b>How about it, Kil?</b>

12:38.310 --> 12:41.570
<b>If I ask Mama, those three can become...</b>

12:44.340 --> 12:45.360
<b>Milluki.</b>

12:46.640 --> 12:51.420
<b>If you so much as touch them, I'll kill you.</b>

12:56.400 --> 12:58.580
<b>Forgive me for not introducing myself.</b>

12:58.580 --> 13:00.860
<b>I am Killua's mother.</b>

13:00.860 --> 13:02.300
<b>This is Kalluto.</b>

13:06.540 --> 13:10.180
<b>Why can't Killua come see us?</b>

13:10.540 --> 13:12.680
<b>Because he's in solitary confinement.</b>

13:12.680 --> 13:14.050
<b>Solitary confinement?</b>

13:14.050 --> 13:18.910
<b>Kil stabbed me and his brother 
before he ran away from home.</b>

13:19.370 --> 13:21.110
<b>That is the story he told us.</b>

13:21.570 --> 13:27.360
<b>Kil returned because he regretted his actions.</b>

13:28.070 --> 13:31.620
<b>And he voluntarily entered 
solitary confinement.</b>

13:31.620 --> 13:35.250
<b>So we do not know when he will leave...</b>

13:36.440 --> 13:40.130
<b>What? Father! What are you doing?!</b>

13:40.130 --> 13:42.120
<b>Don't do anything hasty!</b>

13:42.120 --> 13:44.130
<b>He's finally returned!</b>

13:47.840 --> 13:49.360
<b>I'm coming in.</b>

13:52.890 --> 13:54.200
<b>One Kill Per Day</b>

13:54.570 --> 13:57.650
<b>That's enough, Mil.</b>

13:57.950 --> 13:59.610
<b>But, Grandpa Zeno...</b>

13:59.610 --> 14:02.080
<b>He isn't sorry at all.</b>

14:02.080 --> 14:04.530
<b>I know that.</b>

14:05.250 --> 14:08.060
<b>Kil, you can go.</b>

14:08.060 --> 14:09.410
<b>Okay.</b>

14:17.540 --> 14:19.910
<b>Man, that hurt.</b>

14:19.910 --> 14:22.340
<b>Bro, I'm not sorry.</b>

14:22.870 --> 14:24.780
<b>But I do feel bad.</b>

14:25.570 --> 14:28.300
<b>So I let you slap me around.</b>

14:28.300 --> 14:29.620
<b>What was that?</b>

14:30.840 --> 14:33.850
<b>Kil, Silva wants to see you.</b>

14:34.540 --> 14:35.730
<b>Dad?</b>

14:37.090 --> 14:38.050
<b>Okay.</b>

14:43.610 --> 14:45.230
<b>Damn it!</b>

14:45.230 --> 14:48.530
<b>You always spoil Kil, Grandpa!</b>

14:48.530 --> 14:51.060
<b>That's why he's such an uppity brat...</b>

14:53.180 --> 14:55.830
<b>He's special.</b>

14:56.670 --> 15:01.600
<b>Mil, what do you think of Kil's potential?</b>

15:01.600 --> 15:03.410
<b>It's incredible, sure.</b>

15:05.100 --> 15:10.280
<b>He's probably the most talented 
Zoldyck in history?</b>

15:10.280 --> 15:12.270
<b>Mama seems to think so.</b>

15:12.270 --> 15:14.020
<b>I have to agree.</b>

15:14.020 --> 15:16.140
<b>Considerable praise.</b>

15:16.410 --> 15:19.190
<b>But he fails as an assassin</b>

15:19.190 --> 15:20.790
<b>because he's so moody.</b>

15:20.790 --> 15:22.060
<b>Moody?</b>

15:22.060 --> 15:25.900
<b>A kid who wants to make friends 
can't lead the Zoldyck family.</b>

15:26.580 --> 15:29.220
<b>In the end, he's just a crybaby.</b>

15:29.220 --> 15:31.060
<b>Mentally weak.</b>

15:34.250 --> 15:36.380
<b>That is true...</b>

15:36.380 --> 15:38.600
<b>Right? Take me.</b>

15:38.600 --> 15:41.730
<b>I'll kill anyone I'm asked to.</b>

15:42.720 --> 15:43.990
<b>Oh, that's right.</b>

15:43.990 --> 15:46.390
<b>The bomb I'll use next time 
is awesome, Grandpa!</b>

15:46.390 --> 15:47.840
<b>It's super-compact.</b>

15:47.840 --> 15:49.310
<b>I attached it to a female mosquito,</b>

15:49.310 --> 15:53.600
<b>and it's triggered to explode when the 
mosquito sucks the target's blood.</b>

15:53.600 --> 15:57.760
<b>But the problem is getting the mosquito 
to recognize the target...</b>

15:57.760 --> 15:58.810
<b>Mil...</b>

15:59.950 --> 16:02.190
<b>You're a bright boy,</b>

16:02.190 --> 16:05.030
<b>but that foolish nature of yours doesn't help.</b>

16:06.540 --> 16:09.760
<b>Oh, why must Father be this way?</b>

16:11.430 --> 16:14.060
<b>Something has come up.</b>

16:14.060 --> 16:15.200
<b>So I bid you farewell.</b>

16:15.550 --> 16:16.950
<b>Please wait!</b>

16:18.700 --> 16:22.460
<b>We'll be staying in town for a while.</b>

16:22.460 --> 16:24.960
<b>Please let Killua know.</b>

16:24.960 --> 16:27.630
<b>Very well. I shall tell him.</b>

16:27.630 --> 16:28.710
<b>Goodbye.</b>

16:33.130 --> 16:36.220
<b>Who are you?</b>

16:36.650 --> 16:38.600
<b>Killua's friends.</b>

16:39.540 --> 16:41.000
<b>Friends...</b>

16:41.610 --> 16:43.800
<b>Kalluto-chan! What are you doing?</b>

16:43.800 --> 16:44.980
<b>Come over here!</b>

16:44.980 --> 16:46.650
<b>Yes, Mother.</b>

16:51.510 --> 16:54.780
<b>I probably shouldn't say it, 
but these people creep me out...</b>

16:55.260 --> 16:58.780
<b>And I bet they were lying about Killua's 
saying that he can't see us.</b>

16:58.780 --> 17:01.870
<b>Gon, we can't go back yet.</b>

17:01.870 --> 17:03.660
<b>How about we tail them?</b>

17:04.270 --> 17:07.170
<b>Sure, but if we do that,</b>

17:07.170 --> 17:10.800
<b>she'll take the blame.</b>

17:10.800 --> 17:12.700
<b>Oh, right...</b>

17:13.170 --> 17:16.870
<b>I will take you to the butler's office.</b>

17:17.260 --> 17:21.490
<b>There is a phone that connects to the mansion.</b>

17:22.050 --> 17:25.270
<b>If Zeno-sama is the one who answers...</b>

17:25.610 --> 17:27.010
<b>Zeno-sama?</b>

17:27.650 --> 17:29.760
<b>Killua-sama's grandfather.</b>

17:38.270 --> 17:39.390
<b>Kil.</b>

17:40.610 --> 17:42.510
<b>I heard that you've made some friends?</b>

17:43.410 --> 17:44.790
<b>Yeah.</b>

17:45.950 --> 17:47.320
<b>What sort of people are they?</b>

17:48.220 --> 17:49.600
<b>What sort of...?</b>

17:50.080 --> 17:52.300
<b>They're people I enjoy being with.</b>

17:52.830 --> 17:53.870
<b>I see.</b>

17:56.490 --> 17:58.470
<b>How was the Exam?</b>

18:00.290 --> 18:01.860
<b>It was easy.</b>

18:04.620 --> 18:07.120
<b>Kil, come over here.</b>

18:07.120 --> 18:07.810
<b>Huh?</b>

18:09.170 --> 18:11.440
<b>I want you to tell me more.</b>

18:13.480 --> 18:16.090
<b>What did you do during the Exam?</b>

18:16.090 --> 18:18.640
<b>Who did you meet? How did you feel?</b>

18:20.010 --> 18:23.060
<b>You can tell me anything...</b>

18:24.310 --> 18:25.330
<b>Okay.</b>

18:29.150 --> 18:30.280
<b>I can't believe this.</b>

18:30.280 --> 18:32.510
<b>Father didn't even ask me first.</b>

18:33.440 --> 18:37.340
<b>Oh, Kil seems to be having fun with Papa...</b>

18:39.900 --> 18:41.350
<b>I won't forgive them!</b>

18:42.020 --> 18:45.560
<b>And guess what Gon said next...</b>

18:46.590 --> 18:48.370
<b>He didn't want his legs cut off,</b>

18:48.370 --> 18:50.590
<b>but he didn't want to surrender, either!</b>

18:52.860 --> 18:54.540
<b>He's so self-centered.</b>

18:54.540 --> 18:56.070
<b>Sounds like an interesting boy.</b>

18:56.970 --> 18:58.390
<b>And then his opponent</b>

18:58.390 --> 19:01.980
<b>pointed a blade at Gon's forehead, 
but Gon still...</b>

19:01.980 --> 19:02.940
<b>Kil.</b>

19:02.940 --> 19:03.740
<b>Huh?</b>

19:05.540 --> 19:07.530
<b>Do you want to see your friends?</b>

19:10.020 --> 19:11.720
<b>You don't need to hold back.</b>

19:11.720 --> 19:13.140
<b>Tell me the truth.</b>

19:14.520 --> 19:15.850
<b>Thinking back,</b>

19:16.710 --> 19:20.490
<b>we've never had a father-son chat before.</b>

19:22.520 --> 19:25.430
<b>I was raised by my parents to be an assassin.</b>

19:26.190 --> 19:29.080
<b>And I raised you the same way.</b>

19:31.920 --> 19:33.760
<b>You and I are different.</b>

19:34.450 --> 19:38.680
<b>I didn't realize that until you left home.</b>

19:41.620 --> 19:43.590
<b>You are my son.</b>

19:44.080 --> 19:46.580
<b>But you are your own person.</b>

19:47.240 --> 19:48.720
<b>Live as you please.</b>

19:50.010 --> 19:53.960
<b>If you get tired, you can come home.</b>

19:56.100 --> 19:57.840
<b>I'll ask you one more time.</b>

19:58.580 --> 20:00.310
<b>Do you want to see your friends?</b>

20:01.590 --> 20:02.340
<b>Uh-huh.</b>

20:03.160 --> 20:04.420
<b>I understand.</b>

20:05.960 --> 20:07.770
<b>You're free now.</b>

20:08.260 --> 20:09.270
<b>But...</b>

20:12.900 --> 20:14.360
<b>Promise me one thing.</b>

20:15.460 --> 20:17.700
<b>Never betray your friends.</b>

20:18.490 --> 20:19.680
<b>Understand?</b>

20:22.590 --> 20:23.830
<b>I promise.</b>

20:23.830 --> 20:24.870
<b>I'll never betray them.</b>

20:25.440 --> 20:26.760
<b>Never.</b>

20:32.970 --> 20:34.140
<b>Kil.</b>

20:35.070 --> 20:38.020
<b>It's too late. Those three left.</b>

20:38.020 --> 20:39.610
<b>Return to your cell.</b>

20:40.540 --> 20:43.130
<b>No way. I'm leaving.</b>

20:43.130 --> 20:43.800
<b>Kil!</b>

20:48.920 --> 20:50.150
<b>Out of my way.</b>

20:56.590 --> 20:58.240
<b>Oh, Kil...</b>

20:58.980 --> 21:03.150
<b>Your eyes are so cold now...</b>

21:09.730 --> 21:12.050
<b>What were you thinking?</b>

21:12.050 --> 21:14.210
<b>Kil was finally home!</b>

21:14.210 --> 21:16.420
<b>For now, we'll let him do what he wants.</b>

21:16.420 --> 21:18.830
<b>No! What are you saying?</b>

21:18.830 --> 21:21.020
<b>This is a critical juncture in the process</b>

21:21.020 --> 21:23.300
<b>of determining if he's qualified 
to lead the family!</b>

21:23.300 --> 21:25.280
<b>So you understand what's at stake.</b>

21:25.280 --> 21:29.300
<b>Then stop griping, and keep your mouth shut!</b>

21:33.340 --> 21:35.810
<b>He'll come home one day.</b>

21:36.780 --> 21:39.500
<b>Because he is my son.</b>

21:41.900 --> 21:44.520
<b>Killua has been set free.</b>

21:44.520 --> 21:48.830
<b>But Silva declares that Killua 
will return as an assassin.</b>

21:49.810 --> 21:53.590
<b>Meanwhile, Gon and his friends 
head to the butler's office.</b>

21:53.590 --> 21:57.030
<b>Will they be able to see Killua?</b>

23:26.730 --> 23:29.300
<b>Next time: Can't See x If x You're Blind!</b>

23:29.300 --> 23:31.340
<b>Eye for an eye.</b>

23:31.340 --> 23:32.680
<b>Eye for a tooth?</b>

23:32.680 --> 23:34.350
<b>Tooth for a tooth!</b>
