<i>Previously on</i>
The Big Bang Theory:

00:02.100 --> 00:04.551
Guess who I found at LAX.
My baby sister Priya.

00:04.552 --> 00:06.703
It's really nice
to see you again, Leonard.

00:06.704 --> 00:08.572
Yeah, it's good
to see you, too.

00:08.573 --> 00:09.640
Here you go.

00:09.641 --> 00:10.808
Thanks.

00:14.442 --> 00:15.859
You slept with
my sister?!

00:15.860 --> 00:17.110
Yeah.

00:17.111 --> 00:19.246
This is a terrible
betrayal of my trust!

00:19.247 --> 00:21.114
Would it help
if I told you

00:21.115 --> 00:22.783
that I offered
her my heart,

00:22.784 --> 00:24.618
and she kinda
stomped on it?!

00:24.619 --> 00:25.902
How hard did she stomp?

00:25.903 --> 00:27.120
Very hard.

00:27.121 --> 00:29.489
Okay, I'm good.

00:34.996 --> 00:36.697
What's so funny?

00:36.698 --> 00:38.932
Nothing. Just thinking

00:38.933 --> 00:42.369
about the noises people
make during sex.

00:42.370 --> 00:45.405
I do sometimes get a bit
carried away, don't I?

00:46.941 --> 00:48.392
It's cute.

00:48.393 --> 00:52.145
You sound a little
like a drunken monkey.

00:52.146 --> 00:54.982
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh!

00:57.018 --> 00:59.920
You know it's meant
as a compliment.

00:59.921 --> 01:01.521
That's how I take it.

01:01.522 --> 01:04.024
This is perfect.

01:04.025 --> 01:06.960
I hope this moment
never ends.

01:06.961 --> 01:08.528
Me, too.

01:11.032 --> 01:13.100
Well, gotta go.
Oh!

01:16.070 --> 01:18.121
Already?
Why don't you stay over?

01:18.122 --> 01:20.540
I'd love to, but you know

01:20.541 --> 01:23.627
my mother needs me in
the morning.

01:25.913 --> 01:29.683
I think the woman can manage
to put a wig on by herself.

01:29.684 --> 01:32.452
It's not just the wig.

01:32.453 --> 01:34.621
It's pinning her hair up,
drawing on her eyebrows.

01:34.622 --> 01:36.189
It's a two-person job.

01:38.092 --> 01:41.028
It's just, when you leave right
after we make love,

01:41.029 --> 01:42.629
it makes me feel...

01:42.630 --> 01:43.897
cheap.

01:43.898 --> 01:45.932
Oh, honey, I'm sorry.

01:45.933 --> 01:47.567
What can I do?

01:47.568 --> 01:48.935
Stay.

01:48.936 --> 01:51.338
Okay.

01:56.577 --> 01:58.879
Like, what, another five,
ten minutes?

01:58.880 --> 02:01.415
Go home.

02:01.416 --> 02:02.666
Your call.

02:06.087 --> 02:07.387
Howard...

02:07.388 --> 02:11.558
have you ever considered us
living together?

02:11.559 --> 02:13.393
Boy, I don't know.

02:13.394 --> 02:16.863
You, me, Ma living
under the same roof?

02:16.864 --> 02:20.634
No, I mean just you and me.

02:20.635 --> 02:21.902
You can move in here,

02:21.903 --> 02:23.837
or we can find a place.

02:23.838 --> 02:25.639
I've got a better solution.
What?

02:25.640 --> 02:27.707
We wait for my mom's heart
to explode

02:27.708 --> 02:29.676
from all the salt she eats.

02:29.677 --> 02:32.045
Then we just stick her in
the ground, flip her mattress

02:32.046 --> 02:33.380
and move into the big bedroom.

02:33.381 --> 02:35.782
Great.

02:35.783 --> 02:39.786
Look at us planning
a future together!

02:45.359 --> 02:46.660
Who's there?!

02:46.661 --> 02:48.495
Are you a
sex criminal?!

02:50.465 --> 02:54.000
Sex criminals
don't have keys, Ma!

02:54.001 --> 02:56.903
Where were you
so late?!

02:56.904 --> 02:58.305
I was out with Bernadette!

02:58.306 --> 02:59.739
I know what
that means!

02:59.740 --> 03:03.276
I watch <i>Dr. Phil!</i>

03:03.277 --> 03:06.847
I hope to God
you used a condom!

03:06.848 --> 03:09.616
I'm not having this conversation
with you, Ma!

03:09.617 --> 03:14.654
God forbid you get one of
those new fancy sex diseases!

03:14.655 --> 03:17.124
Nobody has a disease!

03:17.125 --> 03:18.592
I hope not!

03:18.593 --> 03:21.828
I share a toilet
with you!

03:23.564 --> 03:25.332
Is that what
you want?!

03:25.333 --> 03:27.801
To give your
mother herbies?!

03:27.802 --> 03:30.303
That's it!
I don't have to take this!

03:30.304 --> 03:34.874
Good luck with your eyebrows in
the morning!

03:40.481 --> 03:41.748
Who's there?!

03:41.749 --> 03:43.884
Are you a
sex criminal?!

03:43.885 --> 03:46.720
I'm still leaving!

03:46.721 --> 03:48.605
I just forgot my Claritin!

04:17.353 --> 04:19.005
Hey, what's up?

04:19.005 --> 04:20.707
I need a place to crash.

04:20.708 --> 04:21.474
Uh, sure.

04:21.475 --> 04:23.543
Why?

04:23.544 --> 04:25.411
Big fight with my mother.

04:25.412 --> 04:29.649
Still arguing over
which <i>CSI</i> is the best?

04:29.650 --> 04:33.686
No, we agreed they all have
their merits.

04:33.687 --> 04:35.755
This was about Bernadette.

04:35.756 --> 04:37.857
What's going on?

04:37.858 --> 04:38.958
Howard's gonna sleep here
tonight.

04:38.959 --> 04:40.343
He had a fight with his mother.

04:40.344 --> 04:43.563
Did you offer him
a hot beverage?

04:50.004 --> 04:52.405
No.

04:54.108 --> 04:57.009
Leonard, social protocol states
when a friend is upset,

04:57.010 --> 04:59.245
you offer them a hot beverage,
such as tea.

04:59.246 --> 05:01.948
Tea does sound nice.

05:01.949 --> 05:04.200
You heard the man, Leonard.

05:06.787 --> 05:09.222
And while you're at it,
I'm upset

05:09.223 --> 05:12.625
that we have an unannounced
houseguest, so make me cocoa.

05:15.195 --> 05:17.330
Point of inquiry,

05:17.331 --> 05:19.966
given that Leonard is
your secondary friend

05:19.967 --> 05:22.368
and Koothrappali is
your primary friend,

05:22.369 --> 05:24.637
why didn't you seek refuge
under his roof?

05:24.638 --> 05:25.872
There's no room.

05:25.873 --> 05:27.273
His sister is staying with him.

05:27.274 --> 05:29.442
Wait, wait. What?

05:29.443 --> 05:30.693
Cocoa, Leonard.
Focus.

05:30.694 --> 05:33.413
I'm down in
the dumps here.

05:33.414 --> 05:36.232
Priya's in town?

05:36.233 --> 05:37.934
Yeah, some work thing.

05:37.935 --> 05:41.020
Anyway, my mother seems
to think that Bernadette...

05:41.021 --> 05:43.122
Hold on.
When did Priya get here?

05:43.123 --> 05:45.158
I don't know.
A couple of days ago.

05:45.159 --> 05:48.111
The thing is, Bernadette doesn't
like that I have to take care

05:48.112 --> 05:50.797
of my mother, and my mother
doesn't trust Bernadette...

05:50.798 --> 05:51.948
Yeah, that's a real pickle.

05:51.949 --> 05:53.166
Bye.

05:56.870 --> 05:58.204
Don't worry.

05:58.205 --> 06:00.089
As your tertiary friend,

06:00.090 --> 06:03.142
I am prepared to step in
and comfort you.

06:03.143 --> 06:05.395
That's not really necessary.

06:05.396 --> 06:06.963
No, no. I'll finish
making the tea,

06:06.964 --> 06:08.965
while you narcissistically
ramble on

06:08.966 --> 06:11.017
about whatever's troubling you.

06:11.018 --> 06:12.919
Thanks.

06:12.920 --> 06:15.989
That's what
tertiary friends are for.

06:19.526 --> 06:20.727
Who is it?

06:20.728 --> 06:21.928
It's Leonard.

06:21.929 --> 06:24.430
You can't come in.

06:24.431 --> 06:26.666
I just want to talk to her.

06:26.667 --> 06:28.101
I forbid it.

06:28.102 --> 06:29.452
Open the door,
Rajesh.

06:29.453 --> 06:30.620
You heard me.

06:30.621 --> 06:32.805
I forbidded it.

06:32.806 --> 06:34.607
"Forbidded" it?

06:34.608 --> 06:36.542
"Forbaded" it?

06:36.543 --> 06:39.212
Get out of the way.

06:39.213 --> 06:41.214
What are you doing here?

06:41.215 --> 06:42.648
What are <i>you</i> doing here?

06:42.649 --> 06:44.017
I have business in Los Angeles.

06:44.018 --> 06:45.518
Why didn't you call?

06:45.519 --> 06:47.086
Clearly, she was
sending you a message

06:47.087 --> 06:49.355
to take a hike, Mike.

06:50.591 --> 06:52.158
I'm sorry.
I thought about calling,

06:52.159 --> 06:55.161
♪but I just wasn't sure if
seeing you was such a good idea.

06:55.162 --> 06:57.597
I know. Last time
I came on too strong.

06:57.598 --> 06:58.898
Can we talk in private?

06:58.899 --> 07:00.967
No!
Sure.

07:02.186 --> 07:03.936
It's completely inappropriate
for a single woman

07:03.937 --> 07:05.238
to entertain a man in private.

07:05.239 --> 07:08.140
If you insist on talking,
you must do it on the couch!

07:09.209 --> 07:11.511
All right, you may talk in
the bedroom,

07:11.512 --> 07:13.880
but I want this door
to remain open!

07:13.881 --> 07:16.866
All right, just this once
you may close the door.

07:16.867 --> 07:19.318
But keep in mind
I'll be right out here

07:19.319 --> 07:20.920
monitoring the situation!

07:22.000 --> 07:28.074
-= www.OpenSubtitles.org =-

07:34.535 --> 07:36.135
Oh, damn it.

07:36.136 --> 07:39.405
Leonard, when you get this
message, call me.

07:45.679 --> 07:48.648
Priya, this is your brother.

07:48.649 --> 07:51.584
When you get this, tell Leonard
to check his voicemail.

07:54.688 --> 07:57.156
Would you be sleeping over
again this evening?

07:57.157 --> 07:58.624
Because you're welcome to.

07:58.625 --> 08:00.793
That's very nice of you,
but I made other plans.

08:00.794 --> 08:03.930
Well, just keep in mind that
should you ever need

08:03.931 --> 08:09.135
a slightly apathetic tertiary
friend, I stand at the ready.

08:09.136 --> 08:11.036
Hi, Howard.
Hi, Sheldon.

08:11.037 --> 08:12.037
Hello.
Hey.

08:12.038 --> 08:13.756
Why are you
holding hands?

08:13.757 --> 08:15.741
I forbid you to hold hands.

08:15.742 --> 08:19.228
Rajesh, you know Leonard and I
spent the night together.

08:19.229 --> 08:20.913
Yeah, but you were just
sleeping,

08:20.914 --> 08:23.449
because I forboded you
to have sex.

08:24.485 --> 08:26.152
The word is "forbade""

08:26.153 --> 08:29.422
You sure?
That doesn't sound right.

08:29.423 --> 08:31.624
Listen, Rajesh, Leonard and I
have decided

08:31.625 --> 08:33.058
to see each other again,

08:33.059 --> 08:34.827
and you don't get
to tell me

08:34.828 --> 08:37.663
who I can and can't have
a relationship with.

08:37.664 --> 08:39.097
Actually, he can.

08:39.099 --> 08:43.568
The Hindu Code of Manu is
very clear in these matters.

08:43.570 --> 08:45.204
If a woman's father is
not around,

08:45.205 --> 08:48.674
the duty of controlling her base
desires falls

08:48.675 --> 08:53.513
to the closest male member of
her family, in this case, Raj.

08:53.514 --> 08:54.747
The code also states

08:54.748 --> 08:57.116
that if she disobeys,
she will be reborn

08:57.117 --> 09:01.921
"in the womb of a jackal
and tormented by diseases."

09:02.789 --> 09:04.357
If true,

09:04.358 --> 09:06.792
that seems
like an awfully large gamble

09:06.793 --> 09:08.995
given that the prize is Leonard.

09:13.600 --> 09:14.934
There it is, Priya.
We're Indian.

09:14.935 --> 09:16.969
We believe this stuff.

09:16.970 --> 09:20.206
I think it also says that
if you eat beef,

09:20.207 --> 09:22.375
you need to live with cows
for three months

09:22.376 --> 09:23.543
and drink their urine.

09:23.544 --> 09:26.913
Some of it makes sense,
some of it's crazy.

09:26.914 --> 09:29.849
My point is, you can't go out
with Leonard.

09:29.850 --> 09:31.284
Who can't go out with Leonard?

09:31.285 --> 09:32.518
My sister.

09:32.519 --> 09:35.087
Penny, this is
Raj's sister, Priya.

09:35.088 --> 09:36.455
It's very nice to meet you.

09:36.456 --> 09:38.791
Oh, yeah, you, too.

09:38.792 --> 09:42.061
Priya, if you're experiencing
any tension or awkwardness,

09:42.062 --> 09:45.147
it may stem from the fact that
Leonard and Penny used to--

09:45.148 --> 09:48.801
if I may quote Howard--
"do the dance with no pants."

09:53.574 --> 09:54.907
Sheldon!

09:54.908 --> 09:56.142
Really?

09:56.143 --> 09:58.861
Hey, Bernadette, can I
talk to you for a second?

09:58.862 --> 10:00.980
Sure.

10:00.981 --> 10:03.249
Penny, you became disenchanted
with Leonard

10:03.250 --> 10:04.317
as a lover.

10:04.318 --> 10:06.619
Would you please tell
my sister why?

10:08.188 --> 10:09.672
Listen, my mom's
going to Palm Springs

10:09.673 --> 10:10.990
to visit her sister.

10:10.991 --> 10:12.425
That's two whole nights
in a row I can sleep over

10:12.426 --> 10:14.393
with you
all the way to morning.

10:14.394 --> 10:15.761
Unless the desert air
dries out her sinuses,

10:15.762 --> 10:17.046
in which case I'll have
to schlep out there

10:17.047 --> 10:18.965
with the big humidifier.

10:18.966 --> 10:21.167
That's it?

10:21.168 --> 10:23.002
That's your big solution
to all of our problems?

10:23.003 --> 10:26.372
If your mom's nose holds up,
we get two nights together?

10:26.373 --> 10:28.608
Isn't that great?

10:28.609 --> 10:30.860
No, it's not great.

10:30.861 --> 10:32.111
You need to make a choice.

10:32.112 --> 10:33.346
Me or your mother.

10:33.347 --> 10:35.214
Uh...

10:35.215 --> 10:36.348
Wrong answer.

10:36.349 --> 10:37.700
No, wait.

10:37.701 --> 10:39.068
You didn't let me finish.

10:39.069 --> 10:40.653
I'm listening.

10:40.654 --> 10:42.321
Uh...

10:48.917 --> 10:52.986
I came as quickly as I could.

10:53.231 --> 10:54.900
Okay.

10:54.924 --> 10:56.925
Why?

10:57.309 --> 10:58.615
To comfort you, of course.

10:59.047 --> 11:01.449
Sheldon told me about Leonard
dating Rajesh's sister.

11:01.472 --> 11:02.939
So I high-tailed it over here

11:02.940 --> 11:05.442
to pick up the pieces
of your broken heart.

11:05.443 --> 11:07.544
Amy, I'm fine.

11:07.545 --> 11:10.680
You don't have to
be strong for me.

11:10.681 --> 11:13.200
Now let's talk about Priya,
that man-stealing bitch.

11:15.019 --> 11:16.786
What?

11:16.787 --> 11:18.455
In situations like this,

11:18.456 --> 11:20.991
best girlfriends are often
catty about the other woman.

11:24.462 --> 11:27.414
Really, I am not upset
about Leonard and Priya.

11:27.415 --> 11:32.002
Oh. Then perhaps you don't
understand what's going on.

11:32.003 --> 11:33.870
Your former boyfriend
has replaced you

11:33.871 --> 11:35.739
with what appears to be
a very suitable mate.

11:35.740 --> 11:38.241
Arguably much
more suitable than you.

11:40.177 --> 11:42.612
Oh. Well, good for him.

11:42.613 --> 11:44.447
Hey, what do you mean,
"more suitable"?

11:44.448 --> 11:47.884
Well, granted, Penny, your
secondary sexual characteristics

11:47.885 --> 11:50.587
are reasonably bodacious.

11:50.588 --> 11:52.122
But Priya is highly educated,

11:52.123 --> 11:53.657
she's an accomplished
professional,

11:53.658 --> 11:55.992
and she comes from the culture
that literally wrote the book

11:55.993 --> 11:58.094
on neat ways to have sex.

11:59.630 --> 12:02.465
Whereas you, on the other hand,
are a community college dropout

12:02.466 --> 12:05.268
who comes from the culture that
wrote the book on tipping cows.

12:05.269 --> 12:07.604
Yeah. Okay, I got it.

12:07.605 --> 12:08.905
I got it.

12:08.906 --> 12:11.708
So... what is
all that stuff?

12:11.709 --> 12:13.910
This is a portable
electroencephalogram.

12:13.911 --> 12:16.463
I'm doing research
on emotions and brain activity.

12:16.464 --> 12:17.814
So when you start crying,

12:17.815 --> 12:20.150
I can see which region
of the brain is activated.

12:21.118 --> 12:23.253
Then I'm going to stimulate
the analogous area

12:23.254 --> 12:26.089
in the brain of a rhesus monkey
and see if he cries.

12:27.191 --> 12:29.326
Cool, huh?

12:44.008 --> 12:46.142
I choose you.

12:46.143 --> 12:47.811
Really?

12:47.812 --> 12:49.679
Yep. I moved out
of my mother's house.

12:49.680 --> 12:50.747
Cord is cut.

12:50.748 --> 12:52.949
I'm all yours.

12:53.751 --> 12:55.302
What did she say
when you told her?

12:55.303 --> 12:58.254
I don't know. She hasn't
responded to my email yet.

12:58.255 --> 13:00.991
This is so great.

13:00.992 --> 13:03.059
I love you, Howard.

13:03.060 --> 13:04.344
I love you, too.

13:04.345 --> 13:05.762
So what's for dinner?

13:07.464 --> 13:09.599
Well, I don't really have much
of anything in the house.

13:09.600 --> 13:11.501
That's fine.

13:11.502 --> 13:13.737
Why don't we go fool
around in our bedroom?

13:15.406 --> 13:16.906
And then you
can go shopping.

13:19.710 --> 13:22.696
I thought maybe after we eat,
we could see an early movie.

13:22.697 --> 13:23.980
I'd love that.

13:23.981 --> 13:25.615
I love the way you say,

13:25.616 --> 13:28.218
"I'd love that."

13:28.219 --> 13:30.387
She says it the same way I do.

13:31.956 --> 13:33.890
"I'd love that."

13:33.891 --> 13:35.892
Everybody in India
says it that way.

13:35.893 --> 13:37.394
It's not a big deal.

13:38.179 --> 13:40.513
Rajesh, don't be a child.

13:40.514 --> 13:41.598
I'm not being a child.

13:41.599 --> 13:42.966
Leonard, I swear to God,

13:42.967 --> 13:44.184
if your sister
ever comes to town,

13:44.185 --> 13:45.902
I shall have my way with her.

13:46.971 --> 13:50.073
My sister's 38 and married.

13:50.074 --> 13:51.725
All the more shame
that will fall

13:51.726 --> 13:53.743
upon the house of Hofstadter.

13:56.047 --> 13:58.898
Ooh, I thought I smelled pizza.

13:58.899 --> 14:00.050
That's remarkable.

14:00.051 --> 14:02.318
If pepperoni
were an explosive substance,

14:02.319 --> 14:03.953
you could replace
German shepherds

14:03.954 --> 14:05.855
at our nation's airports.

14:06.741 --> 14:08.258
Hi. Penny, right?

14:08.259 --> 14:10.160
Oh, yes. H-Hi. I'm sorry.

14:10.161 --> 14:12.295
I didn't know you had company.
I don't want to impose.

14:12.296 --> 14:14.214
No, no. It's not
an imposition.

14:14.215 --> 14:17.567
At this point, in our ecosystem,
you are akin to the plover,

14:17.568 --> 14:20.570
a small scavenging bird
that eats extra food

14:20.571 --> 14:22.539
from between
the teeth of crocodiles.

14:24.308 --> 14:27.544
Please, fly into our open maw,
and have at it.

14:29.747 --> 14:32.248
If I had more than a box of
baking soda in my refrigerator,

14:32.249 --> 14:33.616
I wouldn't have to take that.

14:36.020 --> 14:39.222
Hi, bestie.

14:39.223 --> 14:40.623
Hi.

14:42.460 --> 14:44.894
So, um, Priya,

14:44.895 --> 14:46.196
you're a lawyer, right?

14:46.197 --> 14:47.897
I know. Pretty boring, huh?

14:47.898 --> 14:51.134
Oh, come on.
It's not boring at all.

14:51.135 --> 14:54.537
She's currently helping set up
a secondary derivative market

14:54.538 --> 14:57.040
which would allow
overseas car firms

14:57.041 --> 14:58.508
to hedge their investments

14:58.509 --> 15:01.177
against potential advancements
in battery technology.

15:01.178 --> 15:02.462
Hmm?

15:02.463 --> 15:04.013
Thank you, Leonard.

15:04.014 --> 15:06.382
That doesn't make it
sound boring at all.

15:07.952 --> 15:10.487
So, how you holding up?

15:10.488 --> 15:13.823
I'm fine.

15:13.824 --> 15:15.591
Oh, who are you kidding?
She's breathtaking.

15:17.862 --> 15:19.762
So, Penny,

15:19.763 --> 15:21.598
Leonard tells me
you're an actress.

15:21.599 --> 15:23.700
That must be
pretty exciting.

15:23.701 --> 15:25.068
Oh, yeah, yeah.
It's real great.

15:25.069 --> 15:26.703
Today I drove to Van Nuys
for an audition

15:26.704 --> 15:28.571
I thought was going to be
for a cat food commercial.

15:28.572 --> 15:30.540
Turned out to be porn.

15:32.343 --> 15:34.410
Did you get the part?

15:36.747 --> 15:38.148
I didn't do the audition.

15:38.149 --> 15:39.716
Given the state of your career,

15:39.717 --> 15:41.885
can you really afford
to be picky?

15:44.321 --> 15:46.723
I took acting classes
when I was at Cambridge.

15:46.724 --> 15:47.891
I loved it.

15:47.892 --> 15:49.459
We did <i>Taming</i>
<i>of the Shrew.</i>

15:49.460 --> 15:51.761
Oh, wow. I love
Taming of the Shrew.

15:51.762 --> 15:53.496
I did a paper
on it in high school.

15:53.497 --> 15:56.966
"Who knows not where
a wasp does wear his sting?

15:56.967 --> 15:58.001
In his tail."

15:58.002 --> 16:00.036
"In his tongue""
"Whose tongue?"

16:00.037 --> 16:01.905
"Yours, if you
talk of tails,

16:01.906 --> 16:03.189
and so farewell."

16:03.190 --> 16:05.191
"What, with my tongue
in your tail?"

16:12.583 --> 16:14.284
I'm regretting
my earlier cattiness.

16:14.285 --> 16:17.053
She is an
absolute delight.

16:21.158 --> 16:23.343
Wow.

16:28.566 --> 16:30.767
Wow, indeed.

16:31.902 --> 16:34.103
I can't believe we're
finally living together.

16:34.104 --> 16:35.705
Yeah.

16:35.706 --> 16:37.540
You know what would make
this moment perfect?

16:37.541 --> 16:38.708
What?

16:38.709 --> 16:41.911
A little snack.
You got any string cheese?

16:41.912 --> 16:43.646
No.

16:43.647 --> 16:45.348
I-I might have some cheddar.

16:45.349 --> 16:47.217
Not as good.

16:47.218 --> 16:49.953
You can't make strings with it.

16:49.954 --> 16:52.088
Remind me to put it
on your shopping list.

16:52.089 --> 16:54.390
Okay.

16:54.391 --> 16:56.125
You have
hypo-allergenic detergent?

16:56.126 --> 16:57.293
No.

16:57.294 --> 16:58.711
Better put it on the list.

16:58.712 --> 17:00.663
If you wash my underwear
with regular soap,

17:00.664 --> 17:03.199
I get little red bumps
on my <i>tuchus.</i>

17:06.387 --> 17:08.137
Wait a second.

17:08.137 --> 17:09.571
I'm doing your laundry?

17:09.573 --> 17:13.242
Well, honey,
it's not gonna do itself.

17:13.243 --> 17:14.877
Oh, before I forget,

17:14.877 --> 17:16.762
tomorrow morning, you're
driving me to the dentist.

17:16.763 --> 17:18.714
I have to take you?

17:18.714 --> 17:22.018
You don't have to take me.
You get to take me.

17:23.354 --> 17:25.070
Wait a minute.
Are you telling me

17:25.071 --> 17:27.490
your mother usually takes you
to the dentist?

17:27.491 --> 17:29.058
It's not weird.

17:29.059 --> 17:31.794
There's lots of kids there
with their moms.

17:31.795 --> 17:34.998
I can't believe this.

17:34.999 --> 17:36.666
What? It's fun.

17:36.667 --> 17:37.934
If I have no cavities,

17:37.935 --> 17:40.203
afterwards,
we go out for a treat.

17:41.605 --> 17:44.407
All right, Howard, let's get
something straight right now.

17:44.408 --> 17:46.342
I'm not going
to be your mother.

17:46.343 --> 17:47.677
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

17:47.678 --> 17:49.746
Where did that come from?

17:57.988 --> 17:59.088
Who's that?!

17:59.089 --> 18:02.558
Is it a
sex criminal?!

18:02.559 --> 18:06.229
Nobody wants to do
that to you, Ma!

18:06.230 --> 18:08.464
Where were you?!

18:08.465 --> 18:09.899
Didn't you read my email?!

18:09.900 --> 18:13.169
You know I can't turn on
that <i>ferkakta</i> computer!

18:14.538 --> 18:17.407
I left you some brisket
on the kitchen counter!

18:17.408 --> 18:19.075
Thank you!

18:19.076 --> 18:20.443
Remember
to floss after.

18:20.444 --> 18:23.997
We have the dentist
in the morning!

18:27.518 --> 18:28.885
Oh, hey.
What's up?

18:28.886 --> 18:30.253
I just wanted to
check in on you.

18:30.254 --> 18:31.321
Why?

18:31.322 --> 18:33.022
It seems like the
appropriate thing to do

18:33.023 --> 18:34.958
when one's best friend
finds herself replaced

18:34.959 --> 18:36.559
by a smart, beautiful woman

18:36.560 --> 18:40.296
with the smoldering sexuality
of a crouched Bengal tiger.

18:40.297 --> 18:43.933
I already told you,
I'm okay with it.

18:43.934 --> 18:47.103
I mean, if anything,
I'm quite pleased

18:47.104 --> 18:48.488
that Leonard
has found someone

18:48.489 --> 18:51.491
that makes him so happy.

18:51.492 --> 18:54.077
It's okay, it's okay.

18:54.078 --> 18:55.211
Thank you.

18:55.212 --> 18:56.846
Now, let's get these
electrodes attached

18:56.847 --> 18:59.532
and see what's going on in that
pretty little noggin of yours.

18:59.533 --> 19:01.751
Okay.

19:07.977 --> 19:10.678
I smell Chinese food.

19:10.679 --> 19:13.147
It's actually Thai.

19:13.148 --> 19:15.249
You're slipping.

19:15.250 --> 19:17.385
Are Leonard and Priya here?

19:17.386 --> 19:19.554
They went to Catalina
for the weekend.

19:19.555 --> 19:20.888
Oh. Where's Raj?

19:20.889 --> 19:23.791
At home, forbidding it.

19:23.792 --> 19:25.193
How about Howard?

19:25.194 --> 19:26.394
I'm given to understand

19:26.395 --> 19:29.597
his mother grounded him
for running away.

19:29.598 --> 19:32.734
Oh, okay.

19:32.735 --> 19:36.571
Well, I guess it's just
the two of us, huh?

19:36.572 --> 19:38.840
Actually, it's
the three of us.

19:38.841 --> 19:41.142
AMY
What up, bestie?

19:43.045 --> 19:44.379
Good news.

19:44.380 --> 19:46.848
Thanks to you, I was able
to make a rhesus monkey cry

19:46.849 --> 19:49.017
like a disgraced televangelist.

19:50.119 --> 19:51.853
Great.

19:51.854 --> 19:53.121
So, you feeling better?

19:53.122 --> 19:54.222
Not really.

19:54.223 --> 19:56.858
Sheldon, you have
a guest who's upset.

19:56.859 --> 19:58.860
Right. I'll make tea.

19:58.861 --> 20:01.412
- Sweetie, it's okay. I don't want tea.
- I'm sorry. It's not optional.
