00:04.571 --> 00:07.907
- Three days later, the bus continues to burn bright

00:08.007 --> 00:09.876
with an unusual range of colors

00:09.976 --> 00:13.079
due to the hazardous pairing of chemicals in the explosion.

00:17.884 --> 00:19.519
- Hi, mom. - Oh, Drew, honey.

00:19.586 --> 00:21.755
It's just awful. I'm so sorry.

00:21.855 --> 00:25.425
All those friends of yours just burning to a crisp.

00:25.525 --> 00:26.760
- Yeah, thanks, Mom.

00:26.860 --> 00:28.261
- The death of Dory Sief

00:28.361 --> 00:29.929
and her band of popular followers...

00:30.030 --> 00:31.431
- Dude, dude, dude, dude, you could have burned alive.

00:31.531 --> 00:32.732
You could still be burning alive

00:32.832 --> 00:33.900
just like, "Ahh! Ahh!"

00:34.000 --> 00:35.869
- Reid, Reid, be sensitive!

00:35.935 --> 00:38.772
Everyone he knows is dead and he just lost his job.

00:38.872 --> 00:40.607
- Drew, honey, why don't you come home?

00:40.707 --> 00:42.442
You have nothing to live for anymore.

00:42.542 --> 00:43.710
That's when people come home.

00:43.777 --> 00:46.212
- No, Drew can't come home.

00:46.279 --> 00:48.915
We always have to be respectful of his sadness.

00:49.015 --> 00:50.183
It sucks.

00:50.250 --> 00:51.918
- If Drew comes home, I'll kill myself.

00:52.018 --> 00:53.787
- Stop. - Ow!

00:53.887 --> 00:56.623
- Son, it's time to come home.

00:56.723 --> 00:59.759
Why don't you just rent a car and buy a bunch of granola bars

00:59.859 --> 01:02.395
and take a long, slow drive to Chicago?

01:02.462 --> 01:04.798
That's what I did when I was your age

01:04.898 --> 01:07.634
and all my friends died.

01:07.734 --> 01:10.470
- Yeah, I'll think about it, Dad.

01:10.570 --> 01:12.138
Thanks.

01:12.238 --> 01:14.874
I gotta go, though, so bye.

01:14.941 --> 01:17.610
- Bye.

01:36.629 --> 01:38.264
- Everybody be careful.

01:38.331 --> 01:40.800
There might still be chemical activity.

02:02.255 --> 02:04.023
- I don't see any remains.

02:04.124 --> 02:07.961
- Could it have dissolved their bodies completely?

02:08.027 --> 02:09.696
- I wouldn't think so.

02:12.132 --> 02:13.533
- Oh, shit.

02:36.456 --> 02:37.724
- Don't let this leak.

02:37.824 --> 02:39.192
If they know we know they're not dead,

02:39.292 --> 02:40.627
they'll be harder to catch.

02:46.733 --> 02:48.968
- Oh, good job, Pepper. - Thank you.

02:52.038 --> 02:54.374
- Hi.

02:54.474 --> 02:56.643
Oh, my God, hi.

02:56.709 --> 02:58.912
Oh, my God, you all smell awful.

02:59.012 --> 03:00.213
- I know. Sorry.

03:00.313 --> 03:01.881
- How was it?

03:01.981 --> 03:04.017
- We almost didn't make it.

03:04.083 --> 03:05.585
- There's snacks, guys.

03:05.685 --> 03:07.220
And hi, everyone.

03:07.320 --> 03:08.588
- Everyone get a snack. - I'm so hungry.

03:08.688 --> 03:10.990
- How many days has it been? - Three.

03:11.057 --> 03:13.226
- Wait, did everything change? Who's famous now?

03:13.326 --> 03:16.496
- We all need to get on antibiotics immediately.

03:16.563 --> 03:19.532
Portia, you swallowed so much poo.

03:19.599 --> 03:21.701
- Good job, Drew.

03:21.768 --> 03:23.503
- Thanks.

03:28.841 --> 03:31.211
- There he is, John Halwood.

03:31.277 --> 03:33.213
The man who impregnates you with a child

03:33.279 --> 03:35.715
that will bring about the end of the world.

03:35.782 --> 03:37.784
- But he's married. Ugh.

03:37.884 --> 03:41.221
- No, not the dad. The son.

03:44.257 --> 03:46.059
Smug little asshole.

03:48.127 --> 03:49.562
- That's a child.

03:49.629 --> 03:51.898
- In the year 2041, when he's 30,

03:51.965 --> 03:54.867
he travels back in time to the year 2024

03:54.934 --> 03:56.970
and he mates with you.

03:57.070 --> 03:59.973
- Oh, okay, so he has access to the time meridian.

04:00.073 --> 04:03.042
Must be nice.

04:04.110 --> 04:07.447
- Honey, you feel like those women are staring at us?

04:07.547 --> 04:08.948
- Which?

04:09.048 --> 04:11.150
Oh, yeah. Kinda seem like it, doesn't it?

04:11.251 --> 04:13.553
- Yeah.

04:13.620 --> 04:16.055
Oh, my God. Okay, she's coming over here.

04:17.824 --> 04:21.894
- John, it's me, Chantal.

04:21.961 --> 04:24.230
- Excuse me, how do you know our son?

04:24.297 --> 04:26.065
- This has nothing to do with you all.

04:26.132 --> 04:28.668
This is between me and my husband.

04:28.768 --> 04:30.169
- Husband?

04:30.270 --> 04:32.171
- Well, friends with benefits, at the very least.

04:32.272 --> 04:34.574
- What? - Jesus Christ, lady.

04:34.641 --> 04:35.642
Excuse me.

04:35.742 --> 04:38.578
- You may try to manipulate me.

04:38.645 --> 04:41.781
You may try to charm my pants off.

04:41.848 --> 04:46.019
You may think I'm just a vessel for your disgusting plan,

04:46.119 --> 04:47.820
but guess what.

04:47.920 --> 04:49.522
I'm strong.

04:49.622 --> 04:51.524
So do yourself a favor

04:51.624 --> 04:55.662
and don't even try and seduce me in 2024.

04:55.762 --> 04:57.664
- Okay, honey, call the police right now.

04:57.764 --> 04:59.532
- Oh, the police.

04:59.632 --> 05:01.034
They're not gonna do anything

05:01.134 --> 05:03.369
other than gnaw on your puny brain, sweetie.

05:03.469 --> 05:05.138
Welcome to reality.

05:05.204 --> 05:06.706
- Look at him. He doesn't give a shit.

05:06.806 --> 05:08.841
I've got a gun in this bag. Take it.

05:08.941 --> 05:11.377
Do it, you're a perfect shot. End this now.

05:11.477 --> 05:14.180
- Oh, God. - Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

05:14.280 --> 05:15.815
- No. No.

05:15.882 --> 05:18.151
He isn't worth it. Let's just get out of here.

05:20.286 --> 05:22.455
You know, but when you come for me,

05:22.522 --> 05:24.657
and you will,

05:24.724 --> 05:26.959
I'll be ready.

05:27.026 --> 05:29.028
You bet.

05:29.128 --> 05:32.899
- What was that? - Well, you tell me, young man.

05:32.999 --> 05:35.401
- Yeah, where do you know that lady from?

05:41.674 --> 05:42.842
- They've landed.

05:42.909 --> 05:46.679
- Oh, it is so good to see you.

05:46.746 --> 05:48.581
Thank you so much for having my family.

05:48.681 --> 05:51.551
- Oh, well, let's get y'all showered--

05:51.651 --> 05:53.152
- Yeah. - And then do hugs.

05:53.219 --> 05:55.421
- You're all welcome to stay for as long as you like.

05:55.521 --> 05:58.224
- Thank you. I smell so bad.

05:59.592 --> 06:02.395
Enjoy. - So good.

06:02.495 --> 06:05.431
- Thank you. - Joy.

06:05.531 --> 06:09.235
- Have you had this before? - Yes, dig in. Dig in.

06:09.335 --> 06:10.436
- Oh, you look like people

06:10.536 --> 06:13.406
who haven't eaten in three days.

06:13.506 --> 06:16.075
- Dory, have more lentils, girl.

06:16.175 --> 06:18.511
You deserve it.

06:18.578 --> 06:20.780
Hey, so, um-- so the pills are getting

06:20.880 --> 06:22.448
more and more valuable, right?

06:22.548 --> 06:24.117
- Exactly.

06:24.217 --> 06:25.952
- Well, let me know if you need any help keeping them safe.

06:26.052 --> 06:27.887
I'd love to kind of head up, you know, protecting them.

06:27.954 --> 06:30.022
I'd love to be in charge of that--it'd be an honor.

06:30.089 --> 06:31.958
- I think it's best

06:32.058 --> 06:34.293
if I'm the only one who knows where they are.

06:34.394 --> 06:35.962
It's not that I don't trust you.

06:36.062 --> 06:39.766
It's just that a lot of people are gonna be after this.

06:39.866 --> 06:41.300
- Right. Mm-hmm.

06:41.401 --> 06:43.202
That's so smart. That's so smart.

06:43.269 --> 06:45.805
- - But are they in the house?

06:45.905 --> 06:47.440
'Cause I noticed they weren't in the car.

06:47.540 --> 06:48.975
I looked in the car and I didn't see 'em anywhere.

06:49.075 --> 06:53.312
- So what's the next step in the revolution?

06:53.413 --> 06:55.948
- Well, we're gonna get a good night's sleep.

06:56.048 --> 06:58.718
- Yeah.

06:58.785 --> 07:02.622
- And then tomorrow,

07:02.722 --> 07:04.557
we're gonna take the pills.

07:04.624 --> 07:06.292
- Are you saying that tomorrow,

07:06.392 --> 07:08.661
we're finally gonna become enlightened?

07:10.396 --> 07:14.400
- Yes, we all are.

07:15.334 --> 07:16.769
And then we're gonna distribute the rest

07:16.836 --> 07:20.339
to everybody we can, and the world will see

07:20.440 --> 07:22.175
that it is needed.

07:22.275 --> 07:23.976
- Oh, my God. - Yes!

07:24.076 --> 07:25.344
Oh, my God.

07:30.450 --> 07:33.753
- Oh, wow. - I'm, like, so excited.

07:33.820 --> 07:35.755
I'm scared too.

07:35.822 --> 07:38.090
It does feel scary just to jump right in, yeah.

07:47.133 --> 07:49.535
- I'm obsessed with you, I really am.

07:51.270 --> 07:53.539
- And it's perfect. It's right before the fall.

07:53.639 --> 07:55.308
- Exactly.

08:02.482 --> 08:04.383
- Hi. - Hi.

08:04.484 --> 08:07.286
You found me. - I found you.

08:13.292 --> 08:17.897
- When I look at the stars,

08:17.997 --> 08:20.066
I see you, Drew.

08:23.135 --> 08:26.539
Everything has led to this moment.

08:26.639 --> 08:29.075
- In a way, I think I had to sit and stew in doubt

08:29.175 --> 08:31.244
so I could really understand what it's like

08:31.344 --> 08:34.881
to commit to something greater than myself.

08:34.981 --> 08:36.682
- Yeah.

08:38.184 --> 08:41.654
- To have and to know complete faith.

08:41.721 --> 08:44.423
Now that I'm on this side, I feel so free.

08:47.693 --> 08:50.730
I'm not gonna question anything anymore.

08:53.699 --> 08:56.602
- Isn't that incredible? - Yeah.

08:56.702 --> 08:59.272
- I mean, the journey

08:59.372 --> 09:02.008
that it's taken for us to get here.

09:04.877 --> 09:09.549
- I believe I'm exactly where I should be.

09:11.784 --> 09:15.187
I was put on this earth to be by your side, Dory.

09:17.557 --> 09:19.759
It's always been about you.

09:21.127 --> 09:22.962
Always.

09:58.798 --> 10:01.000
- That's cool though.

10:01.100 --> 10:03.936
- Ooh.

10:04.003 --> 10:05.771
Sorry.

10:05.838 --> 10:09.141
Yeah, I just got a--

10:09.241 --> 10:10.643
it's still stuck.

10:10.743 --> 10:12.812
I'll be right back.

10:27.927 --> 10:29.095
- Hi, Portia.

10:29.161 --> 10:30.529
- Hi.

10:30.630 --> 10:33.532
You looked so beautiful tonight.

10:33.633 --> 10:35.301
- Aww.

11:05.531 --> 11:07.133
- My selfishness is showing.

11:15.675 --> 11:17.743
- Is the bathroom-- I think it was--yeah.

11:24.850 --> 11:28.587
- Hey. Hey. - Hey.

11:28.688 --> 11:33.059
- I, um--I literally can't be left out of this any longer.

11:33.159 --> 11:34.593
It actually really hurts my feelings,

11:34.694 --> 11:37.563
so I just wanna do this, get it over with, right?

11:37.663 --> 11:39.198
- Okay. - Yeah.

11:39.265 --> 11:42.401
- If that's how you wanna express your love.

11:42.501 --> 11:45.504
- It so is, Dory.

11:45.571 --> 11:47.373
Yeah.

11:47.440 --> 11:49.608
- Okay. Yeah.

11:54.280 --> 11:57.583
Mm-hmm. Mm.

11:57.683 --> 11:59.118
- Okay. - Okay.

12:27.580 --> 12:31.317
- We'll have the alabaster game hen wagyu tenderloin

12:31.417 --> 12:33.552
with heirloom carrot puree,

12:33.619 --> 12:35.488
candied lobster roulade,

12:35.588 --> 12:37.923
organic vegan turducken,

12:37.990 --> 12:40.793
and we'll do a round of martinis.

12:40.893 --> 12:42.995
Should we also do a bottle of champagne?

12:43.095 --> 12:45.097
- Yes, a few, and I'll take a bottle

12:45.164 --> 12:47.666
just for myself to feel included.

12:47.767 --> 12:49.769
You see, I just had my face diamond

12:49.835 --> 12:51.937
lifted this morning, and I--

12:52.004 --> 12:54.106
I do want to feel included.

12:54.173 --> 12:57.009
- So we'll do a few of your absolute best.

12:57.109 --> 13:00.312
- The stuff you hide away until the richest people show up.

13:01.480 --> 13:03.415
- Money is no issue for us.

13:03.482 --> 13:05.417
- All right. Very good.

13:05.484 --> 13:07.186
- And do you carry Hot Baby?

13:07.286 --> 13:09.421
- Oh, the hot sauce just for babies?

13:09.488 --> 13:12.858
I don't think we do. But I am familiar with it.

13:12.958 --> 13:14.860
- Well, you should.

13:14.960 --> 13:17.797
I took acid and invented it.

13:17.863 --> 13:20.032
I made this family rich off of it.

13:20.132 --> 13:22.535
I'll have a case overnighted to the restaurant.

13:22.635 --> 13:23.869
Really, it's no trouble.

13:23.969 --> 13:25.538
- Are you jealous that my husband

13:25.638 --> 13:28.374
is the inventor of Hot Baby?

13:28.474 --> 13:31.210
- I am.

13:31.310 --> 13:33.946
I'll be right back with your drinks.

13:36.148 --> 13:38.350
- What in the world? Who is Chantal with?

13:38.450 --> 13:40.052
- Turn me. Katherine, I can't see.

13:40.152 --> 13:44.723
- Hello, everyone. Long time no see.

13:44.824 --> 13:46.859
- Who is this?

13:46.959 --> 13:50.663
- This is Liquorice Montague, and she's a genius.

13:50.729 --> 13:54.700
- Ah, fellow genius. Are you an inventor like I am?

13:54.800 --> 13:56.635
- I'm here actually because I want your blessing

13:56.702 --> 13:58.637
on a very pressing issue.

13:58.704 --> 14:00.539
- Is that so?

14:00.639 --> 14:02.908
- I'm asking for your daughter's hand in marriage.

14:03.008 --> 14:05.744
- Since when are you a lesbian? - Shut up, Katherine.

14:05.845 --> 14:07.346
This is much bigger than that.

14:07.413 --> 14:09.081
- Your daughter Chantal is going to give birth

14:09.181 --> 14:12.084
to the man who brings about the end of the world.

14:12.184 --> 14:13.185
- I'm sorry--what?

14:13.252 --> 14:14.653
- And the only way to stop her

14:14.720 --> 14:16.155
from mating with the father

14:16.222 --> 14:19.491
is to marry her so that she does not stray.

14:19.558 --> 14:23.062
- I tried to kill the father, but...he's a child.

14:23.162 --> 14:25.931
I couldn't do it. - Chantal, this is scaring me.

14:26.031 --> 14:28.767
- Oh, stop it. He's only a child right now.

14:28.868 --> 14:30.436
He'll be a man in a couple of years

14:30.536 --> 14:33.772
because he's gonna travel back in time from the future.

14:33.873 --> 14:35.908
I wouldn't have sex with a child, Katherine.

14:36.008 --> 14:37.076
Don't be insane.

14:37.176 --> 14:38.911
- This is confounding.

14:39.011 --> 14:41.447
- As you can see, this is time sensitive.

14:41.547 --> 14:43.115
And I do not think it's right to move forward

14:43.215 --> 14:46.051
without your blessing, so do I have your blessing?

14:47.052 --> 14:50.623
- I-I think it's up to Ted.

14:50.723 --> 14:54.193
Ted makes all the big decisions for us now.

14:56.295 --> 15:00.232
- Well, all I know is,

15:00.299 --> 15:03.736
I've never seen Chantal happier.

15:58.991 --> 16:02.628
- So...

16:02.695 --> 16:04.930
today's the day.

16:08.767 --> 16:12.104
But before we take the pill,

16:12.171 --> 16:16.175
we have one last journey to go on together.

16:17.810 --> 16:22.448
Before I died, I had a reckoning.

16:24.683 --> 16:28.120
I was at an impasse with myself.

16:30.155 --> 16:35.194
My ego had driven me to a place

16:35.294 --> 16:37.896
of such despair.

16:37.997 --> 16:41.900
I was afraid to let go of my ego

16:42.001 --> 16:44.536
because it was my armor.

16:45.704 --> 16:49.308
And I believe that is the space

16:49.375 --> 16:51.710
that you are all in now.

16:53.312 --> 16:58.984
So what we are going to experience today...

17:00.386 --> 17:04.590
Is a transformation of the ego.

17:05.858 --> 17:08.494
And it's going to feel like pain.

17:08.560 --> 17:10.396
But here's the thing:

17:10.496 --> 17:14.099
when you really investigate the pain...

17:16.201 --> 17:21.573
You learn that what you are experiencing

17:21.673 --> 17:25.911
is actually the overwhelming support of love.

17:26.945 --> 17:30.883
- Wow. - So everybody lie down.

17:32.217 --> 17:34.887
Put your hands by your side facing up.

17:36.221 --> 17:40.025
And gently close your eyes.

17:43.295 --> 17:44.863
- And this is Dr. Benny Balthazar?

17:44.930 --> 17:46.965
- So the cause of death was ruled as a suicide

17:47.066 --> 17:49.635
as she jumped out of a window several stories up.

17:49.735 --> 17:53.205
But the way the body's decomposing...

17:53.272 --> 17:55.974
you gotta take a look yourself.

18:03.749 --> 18:06.819
- Oh, good God. - Yuck.

18:06.919 --> 18:10.122
- I know. Imagine how I feel.

18:10.222 --> 18:12.658
I haven't been able to talk about it with anyone.

18:16.728 --> 18:20.499
- Breathing in

18:20.599 --> 18:23.902
and breathing out.

18:23.969 --> 18:29.575
Each breath in making you feel lighter and lighter...

18:30.642 --> 18:33.011
Until you feel so light

18:33.112 --> 18:36.515
that you begin to raise

18:36.615 --> 18:38.984
off the ground.

18:43.155 --> 18:45.824
You begin to feel your body

18:45.924 --> 18:48.093
separating from the ground.

18:48.160 --> 18:51.997
Each breath in raising you closer to the sky,

18:52.097 --> 18:55.934
closer to the tapestry of the universe.

18:56.001 --> 19:00.706
Breathing in love and lightness.

19:00.806 --> 19:04.543
Breathing out any and all worldly attachments.

19:06.178 --> 19:09.014
And then you notice a golden light

19:09.114 --> 19:13.318
shining from the top of your head.

19:13.385 --> 19:15.387
Allow it to grow,

19:15.487 --> 19:19.558
filling the space above you and below you.

19:19.658 --> 19:23.061
Allow it to flow all over your body,

19:23.162 --> 19:24.530
encompassing you.

19:24.630 --> 19:25.964
Allow your golden light

19:26.031 --> 19:29.301
to mix with the light of those around you.

19:30.202 --> 19:33.172
Flowing in a collective energy

19:33.238 --> 19:36.909
that reminds you of your deepest truth.

19:37.009 --> 19:40.012
That we are all one.

19:41.847 --> 19:43.382
Now quicken your breath.

19:43.482 --> 19:46.084
Two inhales through the mouth and one out, like this.

19:54.927 --> 19:58.030
Yes, yes, yes, keep breathing like that

19:58.096 --> 20:00.499
to create heat and energy.

20:00.566 --> 20:04.770
Bring to the surface that which no longer serves you.

20:06.038 --> 20:10.609
Your wrath, your envy, your pride.

20:12.444 --> 20:14.546
Anything that you will not be taking with you

20:14.613 --> 20:17.749
on your journey back to love.

20:18.884 --> 20:20.419
Bring it forward

20:20.519 --> 20:23.889
as we release all of our old selves

20:23.956 --> 20:27.960
in a scream from the depths of our souls

20:28.060 --> 20:32.965
in three, two, one.

21:05.097 --> 21:08.233
You are now ready to take the pill.

21:11.336 --> 21:13.672
- So what's strange is that the color patterns

21:13.772 --> 21:15.974
started at the area of her wound

21:16.074 --> 21:19.311
and then dispersed outward from there.

21:19.411 --> 21:22.447
- Wound? - Here.

21:25.284 --> 21:28.453
- That's not a wound. It's a bite.

21:29.788 --> 21:34.159
- I know. I know it's a bite. I'm just--it is also a wound.

23:00.011 --> 23:03.448
- Based on the blood pooling and rectal decomposition,

23:03.548 --> 23:05.917
I can't help but think that this person died

23:06.017 --> 23:08.920
before their recorded time of death.

23:09.020 --> 23:10.522
- So you think they were dead

23:10.589 --> 23:12.290
before they fell out the window?

23:12.391 --> 23:15.093
- Hey, I just run the numbers.

23:15.193 --> 23:17.462
I wonder if there's a place to get breakfast foods

23:17.562 --> 23:19.264
even though it's lunchtime.

23:19.364 --> 23:21.600
- I don't know. I'm more of a lunch guy.

23:21.700 --> 23:24.603
- Yeah. - Hold up, I forgot my camera.

23:50.395 --> 23:51.830
- Wow.

23:51.930 --> 23:54.666
Wow.

23:57.502 --> 23:59.438
- Mmm-mmm.

24:01.440 --> 24:04.509
Mm-hmm.

24:11.850 --> 24:13.652
- This shit is happening.

24:13.752 --> 24:15.520
Holy shit, it's happening.

24:15.620 --> 24:19.090
- I'm finally, like, truly, deeply happy!

24:20.826 --> 24:24.996
- Oh, my God, I feel like I can feel my infinite soul

24:25.096 --> 24:27.432
and my body all being one.

24:28.867 --> 24:32.204
- Can you believe it? Oh, isn't it incredible?

24:32.304 --> 24:35.807
This is what I've been telling you about.

24:35.874 --> 24:39.478
- I love you.

24:39.544 --> 24:43.548
I-I love everybody here.

24:59.965 --> 25:03.735
- I'm sorry, are they trying to have an orgy?

25:03.835 --> 25:05.470
Is that what that is?

25:05.537 --> 25:07.906
- They're just being love, El.

25:08.006 --> 25:10.909
It's so exhilarating.

25:11.009 --> 25:13.512
Oh, don't you feel it?

25:15.914 --> 25:18.250
Yeah, I actually have to tell you something.

25:18.350 --> 25:20.318
- Tell me.

25:20.385 --> 25:22.387
I can't be bruised by words anymore.

25:22.487 --> 25:23.588
- Mm-hmm.

25:23.688 --> 25:25.423
I switched the pills.

25:32.531 --> 25:33.565
- What?

25:33.665 --> 25:35.767
- Switched the pills.

25:36.601 --> 25:38.937
No one is high off of enlightenment right now.

25:39.037 --> 25:40.672
Everyone just ate a jelly bean.

25:40.739 --> 25:41.773
It's fake, Porshe.

25:41.873 --> 25:44.175
Look, look, look.

25:44.242 --> 25:46.044
These are the real pills.

25:46.111 --> 25:48.113
- No, but I feel changed.

25:48.213 --> 25:49.915
- Right, well, don't you think it's cool

25:50.015 --> 25:52.951
that you could feel that way from just eating a jelly bean?

25:53.051 --> 25:55.353
- Why would you do that?

25:55.420 --> 25:57.455
- Because someone in my life needs them,

25:57.556 --> 26:01.026
and it's the only way I can fix a very sensitive family matter.

26:01.092 --> 26:02.761
And please don't tell Dory, okay?

26:02.861 --> 26:03.862
She doesn't know.

26:03.929 --> 26:06.965
- I cannot believe you! Fuck.

26:07.065 --> 26:10.402
- - I feel like I can fly.

26:10.468 --> 26:12.270
Like I'm every person who's ever lived

26:12.370 --> 26:13.805
since the beginning of time

26:13.905 --> 26:17.042
soaring through the universe at the speed of light.

26:18.743 --> 26:23.315
- Ah, Drew, this is how it's supposed to be.

26:23.415 --> 26:25.650
- Yeah.

26:25.750 --> 26:27.819
- And I just want to share it

26:27.919 --> 26:30.488
with as many people as possible.

26:34.059 --> 26:36.761
Will you come with me?

26:36.828 --> 26:40.298
- Right now? - I just--I can't wait.

26:40.398 --> 26:42.500
- Yeah, let's go. - Yeah? Let's go!

26:42.601 --> 26:45.003
Let's go, let's go!

26:46.471 --> 26:48.974
- Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

26:49.074 --> 26:52.243
There are only eight pills in here.

26:52.310 --> 26:54.446
Someone must have taken a real one.

26:57.015 --> 26:59.751
- Did the janitor come in and take the body away?

26:59.818 --> 27:02.621
- There's no one else in the building.

27:02.687 --> 27:04.656
It's just us.

27:04.756 --> 27:06.758
- You sure?

27:23.775 --> 27:25.443
- Hello?

27:32.517 --> 27:34.886
- Do you see anyone back there?

27:39.024 --> 27:41.192
- - Oh, God! Fuck.

27:55.840 --> 27:59.911
- - Hey, babe, you okay?

28:00.011 --> 28:02.580
- - Oh, God.

28:02.681 --> 28:04.582
- Oh, my God. Oh, no.

28:04.683 --> 28:06.084
- She's really sick.

28:06.184 --> 28:09.387
- Help! -

28:09.487 --> 28:11.089
- Help!

28:12.390 --> 28:16.261
- Mick, call an ambulance! Just breathe, sweetie.

28:16.361 --> 28:20.565
We're gonna get you some help. Does anybody have any water?

28:22.901 --> 28:24.335
- Okay, good.

28:29.240 --> 28:32.010
- Oh, my God. Oh, my God. - No, no, no, no, no, no!

28:32.077 --> 28:33.912
- Get off. Get off her.
