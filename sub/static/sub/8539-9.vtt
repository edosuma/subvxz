00:01.914 --> 00:04.656
[instrumental music]

00:13.752 --> 00:15.928
- Are you ready?
- 'Yes.'

00:16.016 --> 00:18.627
- Feeling awake, mentally alert?
- Yes.

00:18.714 --> 00:20.672
Fantastic. Okay.

00:20.759 --> 00:24.111
I want you to imagine
a screen between you and I.

00:24.198 --> 00:27.157
On that screen I want you
to project a basic shape.

00:27.244 --> 00:29.246
Like a square,
but not a square.

00:29.333 --> 00:30.508
- Got it?
- Okay.

00:30.595 --> 00:32.075
Lock it in.

00:32.162 --> 00:34.121
Now I want you to project
another shape

00:34.208 --> 00:37.863
and put that shape around
the shape you already have.

00:37.950 --> 00:39.778
Okay.

00:39.865 --> 00:41.171
Excellent.

00:41.258 --> 00:43.434
Here's the fun part.

00:43.521 --> 00:47.743
Now concentrate and project
that onto the back of my mind.

00:48.700 --> 00:49.745
Look right here.

00:51.399 --> 00:53.401
Open up your mind

00:53.488 --> 00:54.837
and send it to me.

00:57.318 --> 00:59.842
Okay, now I'm starting
to feel it.

00:59.929 --> 01:02.888
It's a triangle
inside a circle.

01:02.975 --> 01:04.238
No.

01:04.325 --> 01:05.674
- It's not?
- No.

01:05.761 --> 01:07.719
I was thinking of an octagon
inside a rectangle.

01:09.243 --> 01:11.593
- Liar.
- Alright.

01:11.680 --> 01:12.898
Alright, you got me.

01:12.985 --> 01:14.770
Hmm, pretty good, huh?

01:14.857 --> 01:16.685
He got me and Rigsby
the same way.

01:16.772 --> 01:18.861
- How did you do that?
- Oh, that's nothing.

01:18.948 --> 01:21.559
That's just a calibration key
to real mind reading.

01:21.646 --> 01:24.127
Now I have access to all your
innermost thoughts.

01:24.214 --> 01:25.607
- Yeah, right.
- I'm serious.

01:25.694 --> 01:28.175
Okay. So what am I
thinking right now?

01:28.262 --> 01:30.612
You're thinking, "I'm so glad
Jane is joking around

01:30.699 --> 01:32.918
and he can't actually
read my mind."

01:33.005 --> 01:34.616
No.

01:34.703 --> 01:37.575
Well, actually, yes. But-but
not for the reason you think.

01:37.662 --> 01:39.925
What reason do I think?

01:40.012 --> 01:41.275
Never you mind.

01:41.362 --> 01:42.754
You're blushing.

01:43.668 --> 01:44.843
You are blushing.

01:44.930 --> 01:46.236
[Cho]
'Hey, we're up.'

01:46.323 --> 01:48.586
Suspected arson, murder
on a farm in Marquesa.

01:48.673 --> 01:50.893
The county DA's asking
if we'll check it out.

01:50.980 --> 01:51.937
Let's go.

01:52.024 --> 01:53.548
Alright.

01:53.635 --> 01:56.028
[instrumental music]

02:00.337 --> 02:03.210
[dramatic music]

02:15.787 --> 02:17.528
[Lisbon]
'Chief Piller,
why the fire truck?'

02:17.615 --> 02:19.008
Shouldn't they be
gone by now?

02:19.095 --> 02:21.358
Well, it took forever
to put the fire out.

02:21.445 --> 02:23.012
There wasn't enough water
pressure to fill the hoses

02:23.099 --> 02:25.493
on account
of the drought.

02:25.580 --> 02:28.409
Rich Garcia used to have
the best corn in the county.

02:29.366 --> 02:30.280
Now look at it.

02:33.675 --> 02:35.807
Anyway, this is
where we found him.

02:35.894 --> 02:38.984
What was left of him.

02:39.071 --> 02:41.161
There's hardly anything left
for Susan and Madeleine to bury.

02:43.598 --> 02:46.383
Tough to bury
a comrade, I think.

02:46.470 --> 02:47.558
Yeah.

02:48.951 --> 02:51.127
Probably saved your life
more than once.

02:51.214 --> 02:52.389
Vice versa?

02:55.044 --> 02:57.046
How did you know
we served together?

02:57.133 --> 02:59.440
You've been crying.

02:59.527 --> 03:00.571
You don't strike me
as the kind of man

03:00.658 --> 03:02.443
that would cry
for no reason.

03:04.009 --> 03:05.707
That's a National Guard
signet ring

03:05.794 --> 03:07.361
you're wearing,
isn't it?

03:07.448 --> 03:10.494
Yeah, we were
in the 3-192 Armor.

03:10.581 --> 03:12.453
We did two tours
in Anbar together.

03:12.540 --> 03:13.584
Ah.

03:15.412 --> 03:18.198
So you must be
the arson specialist.

03:18.285 --> 03:23.028
- Uh, no. The arson specialist--
- That would be Agent Rigsby.

03:23.115 --> 03:25.509
Mr. Jane is a consultant.

03:25.596 --> 03:27.424
So you-you'll be able
to tell, then

03:27.511 --> 03:29.948
definitively whether
the fire was, uh..

03:30.035 --> 03:31.776
'...arson or accident
or whatever?'

03:31.863 --> 03:34.257
Two years with the San Diego
county arson squad, chief.

03:34.344 --> 03:36.694
'I'll be able to tell.'

03:36.781 --> 03:38.957
Chief, you and your men haven't
contaminated the scene, correct?

03:39.044 --> 03:42.134
My men? Uh, it's just me
and Terry O'Brien, agent.

03:42.222 --> 03:43.745
But yeah, we did
like you said.

03:43.832 --> 03:46.835
After we hauled Rich out,
we haven't set foot in.

03:46.922 --> 03:50.752
So to determine if it's arson,
I need to analyze the burn path

03:50.839 --> 03:53.015
'find the point of origin.'

03:53.102 --> 03:55.496
'Check for signs of
an accelerant.'

03:59.151 --> 04:00.196
It's arson, alright.

04:05.941 --> 04:07.072
And murder.

04:08.552 --> 04:09.510
How can you tell?

04:10.772 --> 04:13.165
This is part of the garage door.

04:13.253 --> 04:15.124
Yes?

04:15.211 --> 04:17.474
The lock's on the outside.

04:17.561 --> 04:21.870
Someone locked Garcia in,
lit the place up.

04:21.957 --> 04:23.872
'Your friend was murdered.'

04:23.959 --> 04:25.090
I'm sorry.

04:28.572 --> 04:30.748
Don't they usually like to
watch their work, arsonists?

04:30.835 --> 04:34.056
Yeah, even more so when
it's coupled with murder.

04:34.143 --> 04:35.840
Maybe this guy's different.

04:35.927 --> 04:37.407
What do you think?

04:37.494 --> 04:38.669
Jane?

04:38.756 --> 04:39.801
'Jane?'

04:40.889 --> 04:42.238
Jane?

04:44.675 --> 04:46.547
Patrick Jane?

04:46.634 --> 04:47.809
Over here!

04:49.201 --> 04:50.420
'He watched from up here.'

04:53.728 --> 04:54.685
He was here.

04:57.514 --> 04:59.995
[instrumental music]

05:08.917 --> 05:11.615
- 'What does it look like?'
- 'It's sophisticated work.'

05:11.702 --> 05:14.444
Electronic timers,
mercury switches.

05:14.531 --> 05:16.359
Need the lab on it
to be sure, but

05:16.446 --> 05:18.492
looks like they used a
distinctive accelerant.

05:18.579 --> 05:20.320
Rocket fuel,
something like that.

05:20.407 --> 05:23.627
So we have a pro at work or
a very gifted amateur. Great.

05:23.714 --> 05:26.108
And get a cast of the tire
tracks down the road.

05:26.195 --> 05:27.762
You guys go into town
and talk to the guy

05:27.849 --> 05:29.285
Garcia was going to
meet that night

05:29.372 --> 05:31.461
- Chief, what's his name?
- Mitchell Reese.

05:31.548 --> 05:33.463
He works the gas station
on main street.

05:33.550 --> 05:34.638
Mitchell Reese.
On our way.

05:36.336 --> 05:38.686
Let's you and me go in
and talk to the widow.

05:38.773 --> 05:40.252
Jane?

05:58.706 --> 06:01.056
They're from the California
Bureau of Investigation.

06:01.143 --> 06:03.232
They're gonna help find
who did this to Rich.

06:03.319 --> 06:04.668
Hi.

06:04.755 --> 06:06.583
'Nice to meet you.
Thank you for coming.'

06:07.976 --> 06:11.022
I, uh..
Are you hungry?

06:11.109 --> 06:12.197
There's more than enough.

06:12.284 --> 06:13.634
Oh, I-I could do
with a bite.

06:13.721 --> 06:15.853
No, but thank you,
Mrs. Garcia.

06:15.940 --> 06:16.898
Guess not.

06:19.204 --> 06:20.597
Hey.

06:20.684 --> 06:23.470
I, uh, put in some
KP with the dishes and

06:23.557 --> 06:25.210
brought in the firewood,
so you're all set.

06:25.297 --> 06:26.777
Thank you.

06:26.864 --> 06:28.518
You need anything?

06:28.605 --> 06:31.913
No, Ben, I'm good.
Thank you so much.

06:32.000 --> 06:34.350
These are the
state police people.

06:34.437 --> 06:35.743
Oh, hey.
Ben Machado.

06:37.353 --> 06:39.790
Anything you need,
just say the word. You got it.

06:39.877 --> 06:42.097
Ben's our, uh,
go-to guy in Marquesa.

06:42.184 --> 06:44.665
He just means I'm the only
real estate agent around here

06:44.752 --> 06:47.015
who takes his commission
in fertilizer and chickens.

06:47.102 --> 06:50.540
- You were in the 192nd as well?
- That's right.

06:50.627 --> 06:53.064
You have that
military bearing.

06:53.151 --> 06:55.371
Rich and Ben and me
and a couple other guys

06:55.458 --> 06:57.112
ran a platoon together.

06:57.199 --> 07:00.637
Yeah. You're gonna catch the
bastard who did this a-sap?

07:00.724 --> 07:02.378
We're certainly gonna try.

07:02.465 --> 07:03.814
I guess that'll have to do.

07:05.425 --> 07:06.469
'I'll see you in the morning?'

07:10.517 --> 07:11.692
I should go, too.

07:14.912 --> 07:17.045
Ma'am, mind if we ask
you some questions?

07:17.132 --> 07:19.526
No, of course not.
Please.

07:25.227 --> 07:28.143
- Everyone loved Rich.
- I know this is difficult.

07:28.230 --> 07:29.449
[Lisbon]
'But can you think of anyone
who could've..'

07:31.625 --> 07:34.497
[instrumental music]

07:50.992 --> 07:53.864
[music continues]

08:13.144 --> 08:15.190
- You must be Madeleine?
- Maddy.

08:15.277 --> 08:16.626
Whatever you're selling, pass.

08:20.717 --> 08:24.678
[acting like talking]

08:27.724 --> 08:30.161
Funny. What are you, a moron?
My dad just died.

08:30.248 --> 08:33.034
Yes, my condolences.

08:34.731 --> 08:35.863
It happens.

08:38.474 --> 08:39.519
You'll learn to live with it.

08:41.825 --> 08:44.567
Not for, uh, a while

08:44.654 --> 08:45.960
but in the end, you will.

08:47.831 --> 08:49.964
- Who are you?
- My name's Patrick Jane.

08:50.051 --> 08:53.097
I'm the man that will find out
who killed your father.

08:53.184 --> 08:56.666
And have him or her
or them

08:56.753 --> 08:58.276
put in a prison cell.

08:58.363 --> 09:01.018
- If you'll talk to me.
- If I'll talk to you?

09:01.105 --> 09:02.324
Like I know
who did it.

09:02.411 --> 09:03.847
Well, you could
help me find out.

09:05.588 --> 09:07.024
Yeah?

09:07.111 --> 09:10.114
Your dad was in the
National Guard for a long time.

09:10.201 --> 09:12.377
How come there's no pictures
of him with his buddies?

09:12.464 --> 09:14.075
He used to have all
his military crap

09:14.162 --> 09:15.772
in a glass case
on the photo wall.

09:15.859 --> 09:18.688
You know, medals
and pictures and stuff.

09:18.775 --> 09:21.343
- But he took it down.
- Why is that?

09:21.430 --> 09:22.910
How should I know?

09:22.997 --> 09:25.477
He didn't like talking about
what he did over there.

09:25.565 --> 09:27.001
Not to me, anyway.

09:27.088 --> 09:29.569
Who did he talk to,
your mom?

09:29.656 --> 09:32.659
- No.
- What do you mean by, "No?"

09:34.138 --> 09:36.576
Nothing. I mean..

09:36.663 --> 09:38.839
...he doesn't like
talking about that stuff.

09:38.926 --> 09:40.884
Why are you so angry
at your mom?

09:40.971 --> 09:43.191
I'm..

09:43.278 --> 09:45.062
I'm not.

09:45.149 --> 09:46.803
If you weren't angry,
you'd be with her right now.

09:46.890 --> 09:48.544
She needs you.

09:48.631 --> 09:50.328
Her husband just died.

09:50.415 --> 09:52.287
Oh, I'm sure she'll
learn to live with it.

09:54.158 --> 09:55.899
I was watching TV.

09:55.986 --> 09:58.598
Maddy was in her room.

09:58.685 --> 10:00.861
Richard called to say
he was leaving Mitch's.

10:00.948 --> 10:02.514
'He'd be home soon.'

10:02.602 --> 10:05.735
He was doing stuff
for the Avocado parade.

10:07.345 --> 10:11.654
And then next thing,
I heard a strange noise

10:11.741 --> 10:13.482
and I saw

10:13.569 --> 10:16.354
'a light out that window.'

10:16.441 --> 10:19.401
It was the garage...burning

10:19.488 --> 10:21.708
and Rich inside it..

10:22.622 --> 10:24.014
...screaming.

10:24.101 --> 10:26.669
That's what the noise was.

10:26.756 --> 10:29.280
Rich screaming..

10:29.367 --> 10:31.805
...trying to get out
of the garage.

10:31.892 --> 10:33.545
Hello, Mrs. Garcia.

10:33.633 --> 10:36.331
Um, I brought corn chips,
uh, cool ranch.

10:37.419 --> 10:39.203
Thank you, sweetie.

10:39.290 --> 10:41.292
Um, would you like some food?

10:41.379 --> 10:42.946
Oh, could I have some chicken?

10:43.033 --> 10:45.296
Of course, anything you want.
Help yourself.

10:49.823 --> 10:51.651
Tommy does odd
jobs around town.

10:53.740 --> 10:56.960
Challenged, but ever so
independent, bless him.

10:57.047 --> 10:59.006
Challenged?

10:59.093 --> 11:01.095
He's retarded, mom.

11:01.182 --> 11:03.358
'Why can't you ever tell
the truth about anything?'

11:03.445 --> 11:05.142
Everything's a lie!

11:09.146 --> 11:11.018
Sorry.

11:11.105 --> 11:13.281
You know teenagers.

11:13.368 --> 11:14.674
You know why she's so angry?

11:17.807 --> 11:19.940
She suspects that your
lover is responsible

11:20.027 --> 11:21.724
for the killing of her father.

11:24.292 --> 11:25.510
My lover?

11:27.556 --> 11:30.341
- How dare you?
- The policeman.

11:30.428 --> 11:32.082
- Chief Piller?
- Him.

11:32.169 --> 11:36.043
- Maddy suspects no such thing.
- That wasn't very convincing.

11:36.130 --> 11:39.742
You want to try that again
with a little more feeling?

11:39.829 --> 11:43.485
You just cannot come in here and
make wild accusations like this.

11:43.572 --> 11:45.487
You never looked him
in the eye once.

11:45.574 --> 11:47.271
'He kept trying
to take your hand.'

11:47.358 --> 11:49.056
'You wouldn't let him.'

11:49.143 --> 11:51.928
The air was practically buzzing
with furtive shame and yearning

11:52.015 --> 11:55.062
which tells me
that you are lovers.

11:55.149 --> 11:56.628
'And suggests two
possibilities.'

11:56.716 --> 11:59.414
You and Piller killed
your husband together

11:59.501 --> 12:02.678
- And now you're remorseful.
- No.

12:02.765 --> 12:04.506
No.

12:04.593 --> 12:06.551
I believe you.

12:06.638 --> 12:08.989
You'd have found a more
humane method of killing him.

12:09.076 --> 12:11.078
Second possibility.

12:11.165 --> 12:13.036
You have a horrible feeling

12:13.123 --> 12:16.561
that maybe Piller did this thing
to clear the field for himself.

12:16.648 --> 12:20.087
No, Trey would never.
They were best friends.

12:20.174 --> 12:24.134
A best friend that has an affair
with his "Best friend's" wife?

12:25.222 --> 12:26.267
Susan.

12:27.747 --> 12:29.052
We'll find out
the truth.

12:33.056 --> 12:37.452
When Rich came back
from the war..

12:37.539 --> 12:38.714
...he closed me out.

12:40.411 --> 12:42.283
'He went somewhere else.'

12:42.370 --> 12:44.502
He wasn't my husband anymore.

12:46.940 --> 12:48.942
Did you have an affair
with Trey Piller?

12:49.029 --> 12:51.031
Yes.

12:51.118 --> 12:54.774
But Trey would never
hurt Rich.

12:54.861 --> 12:55.905
I know that.

12:55.992 --> 12:57.167
Well, you hope.

13:00.867 --> 13:02.607
[Rigsby]
'Come on, help us out,
Mr. Reese.'

13:02.694 --> 13:05.088
'You might have been the last
one to see Rich Garcia alive.'

13:05.175 --> 13:08.004
How about that?

13:08.091 --> 13:09.092
What's the problem?

13:09.179 --> 13:12.661
- Electrics shot, I bet.
- Yeah.

13:12.748 --> 13:15.011
Always the same with
the early '70s models, huh?

13:15.098 --> 13:18.580
Yeah. I gotta get the old pig
runnin' smooth for the parade.

13:20.712 --> 13:23.150
That's what Rich and I were
talking about the night he died.

13:23.237 --> 13:25.369
Did you notice
anyone else around?

13:25.456 --> 13:28.242
Anyone waiting nearby for him?

13:28.329 --> 13:30.897
- What time did he leave?
- It was kind of late.

13:30.984 --> 13:32.246
Around 10:00, maybe.

13:33.551 --> 13:35.249
Are you thinkin'
this is murder?

13:36.816 --> 13:38.861
Someone cooked
him deliberate?

13:38.948 --> 13:41.168
Yes, looks like.

13:41.255 --> 13:44.998
- That's weird.
- Why weird?

13:45.085 --> 13:46.608
Another man killed by

13:46.695 --> 13:48.610
arson in the same town
from the same guard unit?

13:48.697 --> 13:50.786
- 'That's weird.'
- Hang on.

13:50.873 --> 13:53.484
- Another man?
- Didn't Chief Piller tell you?

13:55.008 --> 13:58.185
Three years ago a guy
called David Martin

13:58.272 --> 13:59.490
burnt to a crisp.

13:59.577 --> 14:01.275
And he was with
the 192nd as well?

14:01.362 --> 14:03.364
Yeah.
That's what I heard, anyhow.

14:03.451 --> 14:06.019
It was before my time.
Only been in town a year.

14:06.106 --> 14:09.500
David Martin lived up
at Alton's Grove.

14:09.587 --> 14:11.633
I'm surprised Chief Piller
didn't mention him.

14:12.721 --> 14:13.853
[cell phone ringing]

14:16.159 --> 14:17.073
Van Pelt.

14:22.513 --> 14:23.906
[female #1]
'Is there anybody inside?'

14:25.952 --> 14:28.215
- Is this Trey Piller's house?
- Fire department's on its way.

14:28.302 --> 14:30.826
- Is Chief Piller still inside?
- I don't know.

14:30.913 --> 14:33.307
[screaming]

14:33.394 --> 14:35.309
Stop! Rigsby, wait!
Idiot!

14:35.396 --> 14:36.614
Rigsby!

14:37.746 --> 14:39.617
[upbeat music]

14:48.452 --> 14:49.976
'Oh, my God!'

14:50.063 --> 14:52.152
Don't move. Don't move.
Don't move. Don't move.

14:52.239 --> 14:54.589
[coughing]

14:54.676 --> 14:57.418
You'll be alright.
You're gonna be okay.

15:03.163 --> 15:04.425
[Van]
'I'm just gonna lift
your arm, okay?'

15:04.512 --> 15:05.426
The doctor said we have
to change the dressing

15:05.513 --> 15:06.601
pretty often at first.

15:06.688 --> 15:08.472
How's Chief Piller?

15:08.559 --> 15:10.910
The burn unit in Sacramento
says it's touch and go.

15:15.436 --> 15:17.829
Hey, check out
Dr. Van Pelt.

15:20.702 --> 15:22.704
Here. It's that mango
crap you like.

15:24.619 --> 15:26.142
How are you feeling?

15:26.229 --> 15:28.275
Took some kick-ass
painkillers, man.

15:30.581 --> 15:32.714
I guess this lets Piller
out as a suspect, huh?

15:32.801 --> 15:35.064
Yeah, especially since
the doctors at the burn unit

15:35.151 --> 15:37.545
'found tranquilizers
in his system.'

15:37.632 --> 15:40.200
He told them he woke up with
smoke and fire all around him.

15:40.287 --> 15:42.593
Interesting new level
of cruelty.

15:42.680 --> 15:45.118
Dosing someone so they wake up
just in time to burn alive.

15:49.035 --> 15:50.036
Hey, it's "The Mummy."

15:51.951 --> 15:53.256
So, the fire
at Piller's house

15:53.343 --> 15:54.823
same MO's as the one
that killed Rich Garcia.

15:54.910 --> 15:57.260
Accelerant's ethyl ether.
That's a signature.

15:57.347 --> 15:59.741
Tricky stuff to work with, too.
Takes skill, finesse.

15:59.828 --> 16:02.352
Why don't you go and see
what Susan Garcia has to say?

16:02.439 --> 16:03.658
Okay.

16:03.745 --> 16:05.312
Let's check out this
Alton's Grove place

16:05.399 --> 16:07.357
where David Martin died.

16:07.444 --> 16:09.664
- Hmm.
- Oh, "The Mummy".

16:09.751 --> 16:11.579
I get it.
Bandages.

16:11.666 --> 16:12.972
And no more
painkillers for him.

16:19.456 --> 16:21.154
Why didn't you tell us
about David Martin?

16:21.241 --> 16:22.546
What about him?

16:22.633 --> 16:24.809
Same National Guard unit,
same death by fire.

16:24.896 --> 16:26.420
That's a pretty
spooky coincidence.

16:26.507 --> 16:28.422
But Dave's death
was an accident

16:28.509 --> 16:30.554
And nearly three years
ago, besides.

16:30.641 --> 16:32.992
- An accident?
- Passed out with a cigarette.

16:33.079 --> 16:34.994
Poor fool.

16:35.081 --> 16:36.517
Burned his place
right down to a cinder.

16:36.604 --> 16:37.779
There wasn't a thing
left of him.

16:37.866 --> 16:39.346
We had to bury ashes.

16:47.397 --> 16:49.921
Are there any, um..
Are there any other connections

16:50.009 --> 16:51.271
between this Dave Martin
and your husband?

16:51.358 --> 16:54.100
Dave was kind of
in business with them.

16:54.187 --> 16:57.190
- With Rich and Trey and Ben.
- What kind of business?

16:57.277 --> 17:00.367
Mar Verde real estate
corporation, they called it.

17:00.454 --> 17:03.761
It started out as a way to get
David Martin a place to live.

17:03.848 --> 17:07.026
No man left behind
and all, even Dave.

17:07.113 --> 17:08.418
He had problems?

17:08.505 --> 17:11.421
He was an ornery
drunk, basically.

17:11.508 --> 17:14.207
Didn't get along with anyone
but his guard buddies.

17:14.294 --> 17:16.339
They got together and bought
a five acre piece of land

17:16.426 --> 17:17.993
from the town up
at Alton's Grove.

17:18.080 --> 17:20.082
And after he died,
what happened to the land?

17:20.169 --> 17:24.391
It took forever to get
the land back into their names.

17:24.478 --> 17:26.523
Legal silliness.

17:26.610 --> 17:28.395
I told Rich,
"Don't waste your time."

17:28.482 --> 17:30.049
"Land's worth
nothing anyhow."

17:30.136 --> 17:33.182
Tommy Olds lives up there now,
kind of a caretaker.

17:33.269 --> 17:37.056
And as of now, Ben Machado's
the only partner still standing.

17:37.143 --> 17:38.535
I guess that's right.

17:40.450 --> 17:42.452
[Lisbon]
'Interesting.'

17:42.539 --> 17:44.802
'Give me a call after
you speak to Machado.'

17:48.589 --> 17:49.851
We have an audience.

17:57.337 --> 17:58.642
Hey, Tommy.

17:58.729 --> 18:00.731
Remember Teresa Lisbon?

18:00.818 --> 18:02.907
Hi, um, come in.

18:09.088 --> 18:11.742
[instrumental music]

18:11.829 --> 18:15.616
So, Tommy,
we're here because..

18:15.703 --> 18:17.705
...Mrs. Garcia
told my colleague

18:17.792 --> 18:19.707
that you look after
this place for the owners?

18:19.794 --> 18:21.187
Um, I-I keep an eye out.

18:21.274 --> 18:22.579
That's what Mr. Garcia said

18:22.666 --> 18:26.148
"Keep an eye out, Tommy."

18:26.235 --> 18:28.237
[Teresa]
'Is that David Martin?'

18:28.324 --> 18:29.978
[Tommy]
'Dave was nice.'

18:30.065 --> 18:32.415
He didn't make fun
of me, not one time.

18:32.502 --> 18:33.982
You don't smoke
cigarettes, do you?

18:34.069 --> 18:36.463
- No.
- That's good.

18:36.550 --> 18:39.074
[Tommy]
'Dave did, and he got
burned up on accident.'

18:39.161 --> 18:41.642
[Teresa]
'Did you see it?'

18:41.729 --> 18:44.340
[Tommy]
'No, I was at the hospital,
cause my appendix busted.'

18:44.427 --> 18:45.776
You wanna see my scar?

18:45.863 --> 18:49.215
No. No, but I'm sure
Mr. Jane would love to.

18:50.564 --> 18:51.782
Jane?

18:51.869 --> 18:54.611
[dramatic music]

18:56.483 --> 19:00.182
Jane?

19:00.269 --> 19:02.619
[music continues]

19:04.882 --> 19:07.233
[crows cawing]

19:11.889 --> 19:14.414
[music continues]

19:25.773 --> 19:27.383
All this green in
the middle of a drought?

19:27.470 --> 19:29.080
Not at Alton's Grove.

19:29.168 --> 19:31.648
Do you like it?
I got Geraniums, too.

19:31.735 --> 19:33.302
It's very pretty.

19:33.389 --> 19:34.956
But don't tell, okay?

19:35.043 --> 19:36.523
The-the company will
make me move out.

19:36.610 --> 19:37.654
I won't have nowhere to live.

19:39.961 --> 19:41.963
Seems like it's coming
from the ground.

19:42.050 --> 19:44.270
It's an aquifer,
new source of groundwater.

19:44.357 --> 19:46.837
- Must be worth millions.
- Worth killing for.

19:50.580 --> 19:52.626
[music continues]

19:54.845 --> 19:57.674
- Van Pelt?
- Yes?

19:59.285 --> 20:01.896
"Grace".
It's a lovely name.

20:03.637 --> 20:06.596
- Graceful.
- Uh.

20:06.683 --> 20:10.209
[Rigsby]
'I've been wanting to say
something to you for ages now.'

20:10.296 --> 20:13.168
I think...now's a good time

20:13.255 --> 20:15.736
'cause...I nearly died.

20:18.086 --> 20:19.392
I love you, Grace.

20:19.479 --> 20:23.004
- I totally love you.
- Hm-mm-mm.

20:23.091 --> 20:26.312
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

20:26.399 --> 20:27.704
Why did you make that noise?

20:32.231 --> 20:34.624
It's not that
I don't like you.

20:34.711 --> 20:36.931
'I do. It's just..'

20:37.018 --> 20:39.020
We work together.

20:39.107 --> 20:41.631
And there are rules.

20:41.718 --> 20:45.505
And if...we were
to get together..

20:45.592 --> 20:47.071
...one of us would
have to leave the unit.

20:47.158 --> 20:50.205
And I'm junior agent,
so that would be me.

20:50.292 --> 20:52.555
And this job is so important
to me, and I just..

20:52.642 --> 20:55.471
[snoring]

21:01.912 --> 21:03.349
[door opening]

21:03.436 --> 21:05.002
Hey.

21:05.089 --> 21:07.004
You wanna go to work, or you
wanna play nurse for King Tut?

21:07.091 --> 21:09.180
Work.
Definitely work.

21:13.924 --> 21:15.099
[knock on door]

21:15.186 --> 21:17.450
Mr. Machado?

21:17.537 --> 21:19.190
Hello?

21:19.278 --> 21:21.541
Maybe he's around back.
Let's check out the barn.

21:23.586 --> 21:25.675
[dramatic music]

21:25.762 --> 21:27.982
[gunshot]

21:28.069 --> 21:30.724
- I guess we found Machado.
- Yeah, Mr. Machado!

21:30.811 --> 21:32.421
Ben Machado!

21:32.508 --> 21:34.162
[gunshot]

21:35.990 --> 21:37.861
Come any closer,
and I'll shoot you.

21:37.948 --> 21:39.559
And I will shoot to kill!

21:39.646 --> 21:42.431
Mr. Machado, we're police!
This is the police!

21:42.518 --> 21:44.215
Let me see a badge!

21:44.303 --> 21:46.087
I'm showing the badge.
Don't shoot!

21:48.394 --> 21:51.658
Damn.
Okay. Don't shoot!

21:56.053 --> 21:57.751
[music continues]

21:57.838 --> 22:00.580
Turn around.

22:00.667 --> 22:02.930
I didn't know
you guys were cops.

22:03.017 --> 22:04.671
What, you thought we were
selling magazine subscriptions?

22:10.416 --> 22:12.853
[music continues]

22:16.204 --> 22:18.249
Hey, check this out.

22:18.337 --> 22:19.860
The accelerant
used in the fires.

22:19.947 --> 22:21.296
Six jugs of it in the barn.

22:29.391 --> 22:30.914
[car honking]

22:32.525 --> 22:34.353
[Rigsby]
'Ethyl ether.'

22:35.789 --> 22:39.401
Burns at 600 degrees Fahrenheit.

22:39.488 --> 22:41.229
You know what temperature
human skin burns at?

22:45.842 --> 22:47.931
Two fifty.

22:48.018 --> 22:51.326
I was lucky.
Second-degree burns mostly.

22:51.413 --> 22:53.981
Trey Piller's face,
just came off.

22:54.068 --> 22:56.113
I don't know where
that stuff came from.

22:56.200 --> 22:57.550
Someone's framing me.

22:57.637 --> 22:59.900
Somebody frame you for
shooting at us?

22:59.987 --> 23:01.597
'Cause from where I stood,
sure looked like you.

23:01.684 --> 23:04.078
That was a misunderstanding.
I didn't know who you guys were.

23:04.165 --> 23:06.210
- I was defending myself.
- Really? From whom?

23:06.297 --> 23:07.995
From someone
trying to kill me

23:08.082 --> 23:10.171
just like they killed Rich
and tried to kill Trey.

23:10.258 --> 23:12.129
And why would you be next
on someone's to-burn list?

23:12.216 --> 23:14.262
Because we were all
in business together.

23:14.349 --> 23:16.569
With them gone, you're the sole
proprietor of Alton's Grove.

23:16.656 --> 23:18.005
Sole owner of
all that water.

23:18.092 --> 23:20.790
Oh, yeah, Ben,
we know about the aquifer.

23:20.877 --> 23:23.271
All that money
right under your feet.

23:23.358 --> 23:24.620
'See, that's the
perfect motive'

23:24.707 --> 23:26.622
for you to burn up
Piller and Garcia.

23:26.709 --> 23:30.060
- You.
- I didn't do it, okay?

23:30.147 --> 23:32.106
[Cho]
'Mm-hmm, so you're saying
whoever did fry them'

23:32.193 --> 23:34.282
is going to try to kill you.
Now who is that again?

23:34.369 --> 23:37.546
- I don't know.
- I gotta say, I'm skeptical.

23:37.633 --> 23:39.505
Why would anyone wanna
see you three dead?

23:39.592 --> 23:40.897
Who benefits from that?

23:46.903 --> 23:48.514
Do you wanna know my guess?

23:48.601 --> 23:50.429
- No.
- Dave Martin.

23:54.824 --> 23:56.913
- David Martin is dead.
- Is he?

23:57.000 --> 23:58.611
Did you see his body,
Ben, after the fire?

23:58.698 --> 24:00.090
No, but he's dead.

24:00.177 --> 24:01.962
You seem pretty sure
about that.

24:02.049 --> 24:06.183
- What are you insinuating?
- Nothing. Nothing at all.

24:06.270 --> 24:08.403
I'm saying you three
tried to kill him

24:08.490 --> 24:10.144
to get Alton's Grove
for yourselves.

24:10.231 --> 24:12.146
That's a lie.

24:12.233 --> 24:14.540
Dave came to you
all excited.

24:14.627 --> 24:16.585
He found a liquid fortune

24:16.672 --> 24:17.978
on property that
you bought for him

24:18.065 --> 24:19.936
practically your land.

24:20.023 --> 24:21.547
Dave owed you.

24:21.634 --> 24:23.462
But he didn't even offer
you a taste, did he?

24:23.549 --> 24:25.942
Ungrateful bastard.

24:26.029 --> 24:28.597
Ridiculous. We had no idea
what was there till recently.

24:28.684 --> 24:31.687
You and Rich and Trey
wanted what Dave had.

24:31.774 --> 24:34.995
'So you set fire to his house,
and you left him there to die.'

24:35.082 --> 24:38.738
Imagine,imagine
the betrayal he felt.

24:38.825 --> 24:40.261
A helpless rage.

24:40.348 --> 24:43.612
That fire was
a tragic accident

24:43.699 --> 24:45.440
and you have
no proof otherwise.

24:45.527 --> 24:48.661
Oh, someone out there
doesn't need proof.

24:48.748 --> 24:50.837
Someone out there needs revenge.

24:50.924 --> 24:54.057
'Someone very smart
and very determined.'

24:54.144 --> 24:56.495
That's why he's terrified
and shooting at cops.

24:59.541 --> 25:01.151
Well, you should be terrified.

25:01.238 --> 25:04.807
I hope you burn like a candle,
you miserable son of a bitch.

25:04.894 --> 25:08.463
You can't talk to me like that.
I have rights.

25:08.550 --> 25:09.551
Yes, you do.

25:11.901 --> 25:14.513
Well, let this creep go.
We don't have anything on him.

25:15.905 --> 25:17.777
[clanging]

25:19.692 --> 25:21.389
Two notes here.
We already have plenty on him.

25:21.476 --> 25:23.347
One, armed assault
on Cho and Van Pelt.

25:23.434 --> 25:25.567
And two, a barn full of
fire accelerant as well.

25:25.654 --> 25:28.309
The assault was self-defense,
and the accelerant was a plant.

25:28.396 --> 25:30.224
- Only two?
- Actually, no.

25:30.311 --> 25:33.227
Uh, where do you get off giving
orders in the first place?

25:33.314 --> 25:36.230
I say who goes
and who stays, not you.

25:36.317 --> 25:38.319
Oh, that's, uh,
fiery but calm. Very good

25:38.406 --> 25:40.321
Well, you should try it with
a more forceful hand gesture

25:40.408 --> 25:43.324
like, "I say who goes
and who stays, not you."

25:43.411 --> 25:45.065
- I'm serious.
- So am I.

25:45.152 --> 25:47.067
If he's in here, how is
the killer gonna get to him?

25:47.154 --> 25:49.069
He could be the killer,
and even if he's not

25:49.156 --> 25:50.461
we don't want
the killer to get him.

25:50.549 --> 25:51.941
Yes, we do.

25:52.028 --> 25:54.378
Machado is our bait.
He's our tethered goat.

25:54.465 --> 25:56.380
And too bad if
the bait gets killed?

25:56.467 --> 25:58.208
Well, yes,
that's why you use goats

25:58.295 --> 26:00.254
and not babies
or virgins, for that matter.

26:00.341 --> 26:01.734
Machado's not a goat.

26:03.953 --> 26:05.172
Well, you're right.
He's not actually a goat.

26:05.259 --> 26:06.477
He's goatish.

26:06.565 --> 26:07.783
He deserves to
suffer a little.

26:07.870 --> 26:10.177
Nobody deserves murder.

26:10.264 --> 26:13.920
Machado helped burn Dave Martin
alive out of greed.

26:14.007 --> 26:16.052
Jane, we're officers
of the law.

26:16.139 --> 26:18.228
You are.
I don't care about the law.

26:18.315 --> 26:19.839
I care about justice.

26:19.926 --> 26:21.710
And justice says
Machado deserves to suffer.

26:21.797 --> 26:23.886
Uh, that's not justice.
It's vengeance.

26:23.973 --> 26:26.410
What's the difference?

26:26.497 --> 26:27.847
What do you want us
to do with Machado, boss?

26:27.934 --> 26:29.675
Let him go.

26:29.762 --> 26:31.198
Really?
Like, let him go, let him go?

26:31.285 --> 26:35.115
- Really, like that.
- Okay.

26:35.202 --> 26:37.334
Trying some
reverse psychology?

26:37.421 --> 26:38.901
You talk tough.

26:38.988 --> 26:41.121
Maybe it's time you learn
that there's consequences.

26:41.208 --> 26:42.992
If Machado gets hurt,
it's on you.

26:43.079 --> 26:44.603
Fine with me.

26:52.436 --> 26:54.264
We've never discussed this.

26:54.351 --> 26:55.788
Because I thought
it went without saying.

26:55.875 --> 26:57.659
When I catch Red John,
I'm gonna cut him open

26:57.746 --> 26:59.530
and watch him die slowly

26:59.618 --> 27:01.184
like he did with
my wife and child.

27:04.274 --> 27:06.494
And if you have a problem
with that, we should talk.

27:06.581 --> 27:08.409
Then let's talk

27:08.496 --> 27:10.411
because when we
catch Red John

27:10.498 --> 27:11.760
we're gonna take
him into custody

27:11.847 --> 27:13.501
and he's gonna be tried
in a court of law.

27:13.588 --> 27:15.372
Not if I'm still breathing.

27:15.459 --> 27:18.506
If you try and do violence to
him, I will try and stop you.

27:18.593 --> 27:21.640
If you succeed in doing violence
to him, I will arrest you.

27:21.727 --> 27:25.208
- I understand.
- I hope so.

27:25.295 --> 27:26.688
Well, I'm glad we talked.

27:26.775 --> 27:28.211
I had no idea
you were so bourgeois

27:28.298 --> 27:30.300
and conventional on the issue.

27:30.387 --> 27:31.954
Mm.

27:36.611 --> 27:39.222
[dramatic music]

27:56.196 --> 27:59.112
[music continues]

27:59.199 --> 28:02.289
You thinking
what I'm thinking?

28:02.376 --> 28:04.552
No.

28:04.639 --> 28:06.206
How do you know
you're not?

28:06.293 --> 28:07.598
I was thinking how I wish
I could go back in time

28:07.686 --> 28:08.774
and have sex with
my eighth grade

28:08.861 --> 28:10.645
history teacher
Miss Huffaker.

28:10.732 --> 28:11.951
Is that what you were thinking?

28:12.038 --> 28:13.430
No.

28:13.517 --> 28:15.824
I was thinking of Mitch Reese,
the gas station guy.

28:15.911 --> 28:17.086
Whatever lights
your fire, man.

28:17.173 --> 28:19.610
As a suspect.
Think about it.

28:19.698 --> 28:21.090
Who first told us
about Dave Martin?

28:21.177 --> 28:23.179
- Mitch Reese.
- He knew all about it.

28:23.266 --> 28:25.138
Even though he'd only
been here a year.

28:25.225 --> 28:26.661
So?

28:26.748 --> 28:29.142
So they never found
Dave Martin's body.

28:29.229 --> 28:30.491
And now someone
is taking revenge

28:30.578 --> 28:32.928
on the people
that murdered him.

28:33.015 --> 28:34.669
Mitch Reese
is Dave Martin?

28:34.756 --> 28:38.325
The beard, the burn scars
on his arms, his whole vibe.

28:38.412 --> 28:40.196
Huh.

28:40.283 --> 28:41.415
Wait, Dave Martin was bald.

28:43.460 --> 28:45.114
- Wig.
- I'm putting money on it.

28:45.201 --> 28:46.463
Let's go talk to him.

28:46.550 --> 28:47.856
No, we gotta keep
an eye on Machado.

28:47.943 --> 28:49.423
Here to protect Machado
from the killer

28:49.510 --> 28:52.295
and if Reese is our guy,
that's what we're doing.

28:53.688 --> 28:55.472
Okay, but I'm calling it in.

28:58.432 --> 29:00.695
[engine revving]

29:04.655 --> 29:07.223
[Cho]
Mr. Reese, when exactly
did you come to Marquesa?

29:07.310 --> 29:09.051
Eighteen months ago.
Give or take.

29:09.138 --> 29:11.184
And what was it brought
you here? Why Marquesa?

29:11.271 --> 29:14.187
- This place was for sale.
- No other reason?

29:14.274 --> 29:16.058
You didn't know anyone
in town before you moved here?

29:16.145 --> 29:17.930
No.
Fresh start.

29:21.760 --> 29:24.240
[door creaking]

29:31.552 --> 29:33.162
[clattering]

29:37.645 --> 29:40.561
[dramatic music]

29:46.132 --> 29:48.177
How did you get those
burn scars on your arms?

29:48.264 --> 29:50.136
Engine blew up on me
while I was working on it.

29:50.223 --> 29:51.441
- Why do you ask?
- Just curious.

29:51.528 --> 29:53.008
- Is that your own hair?
- Excuse me?

29:53.095 --> 29:54.923
On your head. Is that yours,
or are you wearing a wig?

29:55.010 --> 29:57.230
No, it's my own hair.
What kind of a question is that?

29:57.317 --> 29:58.927
- Mind if we check?
- Yes, I do. Ow!

29:59.014 --> 30:01.321
- Sorry, sir.
- Damn.

30:01.408 --> 30:02.452
Thanks for your time.

30:09.068 --> 30:11.940
[music continues]

30:23.734 --> 30:25.824

30:27.869 --> 30:30.002

[male #1]
'Hello, Ben.'

31:11.478 --> 31:14.785
You're gonna need
a firin' pin.

31:16.875 --> 31:19.965
You stay back
or I'll light you up.

31:20.052 --> 31:21.575
Who are you?
What do you want?

31:21.662 --> 31:24.883
- You know who I am.
- I have no freakin' idea, man.

31:24.970 --> 31:27.494
Sure you do, Ben.
You tried to kill me.

31:27.581 --> 31:30.453
What?

31:30.540 --> 31:32.803
No.
That's impossible.

31:32.891 --> 31:36.938
No, it's not.
It's me.

31:37.025 --> 31:39.767
- Dave?
- Ha ha ha.

31:39.854 --> 31:41.900
- Dave Martin?
- Ha ha ha.

31:44.380 --> 31:46.295
'Help! Help!'

31:51.213 --> 31:53.041
Help! Help!

31:59.091 --> 32:01.441
- Help!
- No one can hear you, Ben.

32:01.528 --> 32:05.184
You're gonna die alone,
screaming in agony, like I did.

32:05.271 --> 32:08.230
This can't be happening.
Help!

32:08.317 --> 32:11.668
'Why did you kill me, Ben?
We were friends.'

32:13.975 --> 32:16.108
You wanted money so bad?
You should've told me.

32:16.195 --> 32:20.286
- I would've helped you.
- I did tell you.

32:20.373 --> 32:22.201
All of us, we begged you,
but you wouldn't listen

32:22.288 --> 32:23.811
you selfish bastard!

32:25.769 --> 32:28.381
We didn't wanna kill you!

32:28.468 --> 32:31.601
I'm sorry, okay?
I'm sorry!

32:36.432 --> 32:39.305
[music continues]

32:48.444 --> 32:51.447
See how much better
that feels? I forgive you.

32:51.534 --> 32:54.015
Can't speak for
Dave Martin, though.

32:54.102 --> 32:55.451
[laughing]

32:56.452 --> 32:57.714
You son of a bitch.

33:02.284 --> 33:06.027
Whoa. You don't wanna make
things worse for yourself.

33:08.421 --> 33:11.685
Rigsby, Cho.

33:11.772 --> 33:14.949
What? I killed
an intruder in my barn.

33:15.036 --> 33:17.996
How was I to know
it was a cop?

33:18.083 --> 33:20.476
If that's even what you are.
What are you exactly?

33:20.563 --> 33:23.218
Rigsby! Cho!
They're right outside.

33:24.959 --> 33:27.005
Oh, are they?

33:27.092 --> 33:29.442
Wait a second.
One thing you're forgetting.

Huh-huh?

'You ready to die?'

33:47.938 --> 33:50.419
What the hell's going on?

Oh, dear.

Jane, you in there?

34:37.771 --> 34:40.339
Oh, crap. Jane!

34:40.426 --> 34:41.905
- Jane?
- Whoa.

34:41.992 --> 34:44.517

Whoo!

[panting]
That was close.

34:50.784 --> 34:52.046
Where were you guys?

34:52.133 --> 34:53.395
We called in
to check out a lead.

34:53.482 --> 34:54.701
Lisbon didn't know
you were about to

34:54.788 --> 34:55.876
pull an idiotic stunt.
Sorry.

34:55.963 --> 34:58.139
[panting]
No hard feelings.

34:58.226 --> 34:59.793
Whoa, whoa.
Oh, arrest this man.

34:59.880 --> 35:01.316
'He confessed to
killing Dave Martin.'

35:01.403 --> 35:02.752
- Go.
- Got it all here.

35:02.839 --> 35:05.277
Turn around. Again.

35:05.364 --> 35:08.280
- Whoo!
- Hey, look.

35:12.022 --> 35:15.374
Yeah, yeah, you..
I'll just, uh, just wait here.

35:15.461 --> 35:17.724
Hey!

35:17.811 --> 35:20.596
Freeze!

35:20.683 --> 35:24.252
That's good.
Got him. Whoo!

35:28.038 --> 35:29.910
[clanging]

35:29.997 --> 35:31.694
Hello, sir.

35:36.395 --> 35:39.441
Tommy, what were you doing at
the Machado House last night?

35:40.442 --> 35:43.750
Sir, do you got any soda?

35:43.837 --> 35:44.838
What kind do you want?

35:44.925 --> 35:47.232
My super favorite
is root beer.

35:47.319 --> 35:48.798
Okay, I'll get you
some in a minute.

35:48.885 --> 35:52.019
- Do you like root beer?
- No.

35:52.106 --> 35:53.760
Do you like to
burn things, Tommy?

35:55.892 --> 35:58.460
- No.
- No?

35:58.547 --> 35:59.505
You sure about that?

36:02.203 --> 36:03.509
Am I sure about what?

36:06.642 --> 36:08.296
What were you doing
at the Machado House?

36:08.383 --> 36:11.995
Watching the barn burn down.

36:12.082 --> 36:14.650
You liked watching it, huh?
Gave you a nice feeling?

36:14.737 --> 36:18.350
No, I was scared.
I don't like fire. Fire hurts.

36:20.482 --> 36:22.919
- Do you have root beer?
- It doesn't make sense.

36:23.006 --> 36:25.052
All the evidence
says it's him.

36:25.139 --> 36:27.228
There was Ethyl Ether
traces all over him.

36:27.315 --> 36:29.622
'But the arsonist used
an electronic timer'

36:29.709 --> 36:31.232
and rocket fuel

36:31.319 --> 36:34.192
and Tommy's wearing
Velcro sneakers.

36:34.279 --> 36:37.282
Call him challenged,
retarded, whatever you want.

36:37.369 --> 36:39.066
There's no way
he's capable of this.

36:39.153 --> 36:42.722
- What if he had a partner?
- Well, maybe that's it.

36:42.809 --> 36:44.941
Somebody's manipulating him.
Someone he trusts.

36:45.028 --> 36:46.247
Give me a moment with him.

36:51.252 --> 36:53.428
- Cho, hey, you mind?
- Sure thing.

36:55.387 --> 36:56.388
Don't make a mess.

36:59.304 --> 37:01.480
Cop humor.
Not funny.

37:03.656 --> 37:06.136
I'm supposed to be finding
out who put you up to this.

37:06.224 --> 37:08.748
You see, my friends
think you're an idiot.

37:08.835 --> 37:11.664
Everybody says that.
Sometimes they're not nice.

37:11.751 --> 37:13.840
Yes.

37:13.927 --> 37:18.018
Being a fool gives you
a sort of power, doesn't it?

37:18.105 --> 37:20.586
You're there,
and you're not there.

37:20.673 --> 37:23.850
It's like having a wizard's
cloak of invisibility.

37:25.808 --> 37:28.942
I don't understand what you're
saying, sir, but I like wizards.

37:29.029 --> 37:31.031
The other man said
he'd get me a root beer

37:31.118 --> 37:33.686
but he never did.

37:33.773 --> 37:37.167
Revenge is a hard road,
isn't it?

37:37.255 --> 37:40.345
It's like when Captain Ahab
was chasing Moby-Dick.

37:40.432 --> 37:43.870
The whale died alright.
But the "Peapod" went down, too.

37:43.957 --> 37:47.221
"Pequod."
Ahab's ship is "The Pequod."

37:47.308 --> 37:50.659
Exactly.
"The Pequod".

37:52.574 --> 37:53.836
Silly of me.

37:58.450 --> 37:59.929
Here's your copy here.

38:05.152 --> 38:08.590
I must say, I'm impressed.

38:08.677 --> 38:10.113
I know English
literature professors

38:10.200 --> 38:12.942
that haven't read "Moby-Dick."

38:13.029 --> 38:16.163
I like whales.
They eat squids.

38:17.860 --> 38:19.122
Looking back, I should
have known it was you

38:19.209 --> 38:20.515
the first time I saw you.

38:23.910 --> 38:25.999
Only an idiot would wear
a t-shirt like that

38:26.086 --> 38:29.176
to a house in mourning.

38:29.263 --> 38:32.179
An idiot or a daring killer
with a warped sense of humor.

38:34.790 --> 38:37.140
You're going down
for this one.

38:37.227 --> 38:40.840
You might as well go
down as your real self.

38:40.927 --> 38:42.624
You have pulled off
something amazing.

38:42.711 --> 38:44.844
You should be
proud...in a way.

38:48.064 --> 38:49.675
That root beer coming?

38:49.762 --> 38:52.199
Why don't you just
talk to me, Thomas?

38:52.286 --> 38:55.594
There's no point
in hiding anymore.

38:55.681 --> 38:56.856
I can see you.

38:59.032 --> 39:01.948
[dramatic music]

39:08.084 --> 39:11.044
What do you wanna know?

39:11.131 --> 39:13.002
Hello.

39:13.089 --> 39:14.090
Good to meet you.

39:17.572 --> 39:20.009
I am curious.
Are there two of you?

39:20.096 --> 39:22.360
Or is Tommy just
an act that you put on?

39:22.447 --> 39:25.406
Please.
I'm not a mental case.

39:27.408 --> 39:30.542
Tommy's an act,
a-a performance.

39:30.629 --> 39:31.847
That you never turn off.

39:31.934 --> 39:35.416
He amuses me.
He protects me.

39:35.503 --> 39:39.551
When I was 18,
I jacked a car, and got caught.

39:39.638 --> 39:43.642
But when I pulled the
Tommy act, the cops let me go.

39:43.729 --> 39:46.122
I've gotten much better
since then, of course.

39:46.209 --> 39:48.255
Good enough to avenge
Dave Martin's death.

39:48.342 --> 39:50.170
Three months ago,
the company finally got

39:50.257 --> 39:53.347
a permit to exploit
the aquifer.

39:53.434 --> 39:55.654
All that money.

39:55.741 --> 39:57.612
I put things together.

39:57.699 --> 39:59.397
Realized what they'd
done to Dave.

40:01.094 --> 40:03.662
[music continues]

40:06.055 --> 40:08.188
Thanks.

40:08.275 --> 40:10.364
I confess, I-I never really
did get to the end of it.

40:10.451 --> 40:13.280
- Ahab does die, doesn't he?
- Yes.

40:13.367 --> 40:15.021
But so does the whale.

40:15.108 --> 40:18.328
That's my point.
Revenge doesn't come cheap.

40:18.416 --> 40:20.896
Oh, spare me your moralizing.

40:20.983 --> 40:23.682
I know what
revenge costs.

40:23.769 --> 40:26.336
It's worth the price.

40:26.424 --> 40:29.949
David Martin had
many flaws, no doubt.

40:30.036 --> 40:33.605
But he was my friend.
My friend!

40:33.692 --> 40:35.781
Those animals,
they deserve what they got.

40:35.868 --> 40:37.696
It was justice.

40:37.783 --> 40:42.222
You admit to killing Rich Garcia
and trying to kill Trey Piller?

40:42.309 --> 40:46.574
I watched them scream
and writhe in agony.

40:46.661 --> 40:48.620
And it was beautiful.

40:48.707 --> 40:50.230
It was redemptive.

40:54.887 --> 40:56.279
You wouldn't understand.

40:58.064 --> 41:00.327
[music continues]

41:02.503 --> 41:06.072
Agent Cho does the formal police
charging stuff. We're done.

41:08.291 --> 41:09.467
[music continues]

41:09.554 --> 41:12.295
Good luck, Thomas.

41:12.382 --> 41:16.169
- Would you do one thing for me?
- You can ask.

41:18.171 --> 41:21.304
Would you tell Maddy Garcia..

41:21.391 --> 41:22.697
...I'm sorry for hurting her?

41:25.874 --> 41:28.747
[music continues]

41:31.837 --> 41:33.752
[crows cawing]

41:33.839 --> 41:36.929
Sorry? He's sorry?

41:37.016 --> 41:39.018
You tell him if he
ever gets out of jail

41:39.105 --> 41:41.020
I'm gonna set him on fire
and see how he likes it.

41:41.107 --> 41:42.674
- Maddy.
- I am!

41:42.761 --> 41:44.850
- Your father wasn't--
- Don't you talk about him.

41:44.937 --> 41:47.940
You have no right! No right!

41:48.027 --> 41:49.289
Your father killed a man.

41:49.376 --> 41:51.204
And Tommy killed him
out of revenge.

41:51.291 --> 41:53.336
You know that.

41:53.423 --> 41:55.513
Revenge is a poison.

41:55.600 --> 41:58.385
Revenge is for fools
and for madmen.

41:58.472 --> 41:59.604
I don't care.

42:01.780 --> 42:02.868
Yes, you do.

42:05.610 --> 42:07.568
Hey, come here.
Come on.

42:10.005 --> 42:12.399
[instrumental music]

42:15.620 --> 42:17.839
We have to go, but, uh,
could you do me a favor?

42:17.926 --> 42:21.147
Could you both do me a favor?
Would you hug?

42:21.234 --> 42:22.583
Just pretend like
you love each other.

42:24.367 --> 42:27.153
'Please? That's it.'

42:27.240 --> 42:29.764
'Just like that.
That's good.'

42:29.851 --> 42:31.418
Now hold that pose
until we leave.

42:31.505 --> 42:32.941
It'll help Lisbon
and me feel like

42:33.028 --> 42:34.464
we've actually
made a difference. Thank you.

42:36.031 --> 42:38.947
[door opening]

42:39.034 --> 42:40.514
[door closing]

42:45.475 --> 42:47.869
- So?
- So?

42:47.956 --> 42:49.001
Seems like this whole thing

42:49.088 --> 42:50.872
changed your mind
about vengeance.

42:50.959 --> 42:52.526
Huh?

42:52.613 --> 42:54.876
"Revenge is for
fools and madmen."

42:54.963 --> 42:56.312
That was rather good,
I thought.

42:58.576 --> 43:00.403
Total nonsense,
but quite good nonetheless.

43:04.451 --> 43:05.974
Shall we?

43:06.061 --> 43:07.933
[thunder rumbling]
