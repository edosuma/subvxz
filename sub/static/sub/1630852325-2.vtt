WEBVTT

01:02.028 --> 01:04.531
- Just because I can't see you
doesn't mean I can't kill you.

01:04.597 --> 01:06.399
What's your--

01:09.536 --> 01:12.138
What's your name?

01:23.416 --> 01:25.318
My name's Sarah.

01:25.418 --> 01:27.287
I'm safe.

01:52.178 --> 01:53.012
I played music before.

01:55.615 --> 01:57.083
What about you?

02:14.968 --> 02:16.102
I was a Shakespearean actor.

02:19.305 --> 02:22.709
Well, who'd you train under?

02:22.809 --> 02:26.346
Arthur Leander.

02:26.446 --> 02:28.781
- We can overcome that.

02:34.287 --> 02:36.356
When we fix the ship,

02:36.456 --> 02:39.826
I'm gonna say goodbye
to Arthur.

02:39.893 --> 02:43.496
And Jeevan.

02:43.563 --> 02:45.331
And my little brother.

02:45.398 --> 02:46.232
His name was Frank.

02:50.670 --> 02:51.804
- You've been out here
a long time

02:51.871 --> 02:53.373
by yourself, haven't you?

02:58.578 --> 03:00.313
Dr. Eleven can't feel time.

03:04.517 --> 03:07.921
Okay, don't mind the Director.
He hates children.

03:08.021 --> 03:10.590
Even though
they're the only ones

03:10.690 --> 03:12.358
who can act worth a damn.

03:12.425 --> 03:15.762
Everyone else is
too traumatized.

03:15.862 --> 03:19.999
We're The Traveling Symphony.
We travel for a reason.

03:20.066 --> 03:22.936
We burn the house down,
then go!

03:25.738 --> 03:28.841
Just try to make the world
make sense for a minute.

03:32.412 --> 03:35.615
And, you know, they blame you

03:35.715 --> 03:41.120
if you stay, but...

03:41.221 --> 03:45.024
they love you
like you saved 'em

03:45.091 --> 03:46.426
when you come back.

03:47.293 --> 03:50.630
- How's Charlie?
- Fine. At the back.

03:50.730 --> 03:52.065
Okay.

03:54.567 --> 03:55.702
Yeah.

04:01.241 --> 04:03.810
You good?

04:03.910 --> 04:06.212
- Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Thank you, babe.

04:08.081 --> 04:10.984
- How's your process going,
Hamlet? Hmm?

04:11.084 --> 04:13.453
- It's good.
I'm okay.

04:13.553 --> 04:14.954
- Who wants to go
on a prop run?

04:18.224 --> 04:21.160
- Your leave and favor
to return to France,

04:21.261 --> 04:24.230
from whence, though willingly,
I came to Denmark.

04:24.297 --> 04:27.100
- You okay?
- Yeah.

04:27.166 --> 04:29.135
- How long?
- Uh, 20 minutes.

04:29.235 --> 04:31.971
- Be ready for Ophelia too.
- Okay, yeah.

04:32.071 --> 04:34.641
- Larded all
with sweet flowers,

04:34.741 --> 04:35.275
which bewept...

04:39.145 --> 04:41.814
Hey, you want some water?

04:41.914 --> 04:44.684
No, I got my camel.

04:44.784 --> 04:47.353
Okay.

04:47.453 --> 04:48.354
Everything good?

04:48.454 --> 04:48.855
- You're okay, you're okay.
- Yeah.

04:48.955 --> 04:50.356
- Hey.
- What's up?

04:50.456 --> 04:53.960
- Look who's coming.
- Hey, Traveling Symphony!

04:54.027 --> 04:55.328
What's up?

04:55.428 --> 04:57.530
- Oh, God.
This guy.

04:57.630 --> 05:00.199
Hey.

05:00.300 --> 05:01.301
Hey, horsey.

05:04.103 --> 05:06.506
Dan! Remember?

05:06.606 --> 05:08.207
From before.

05:08.308 --> 05:10.276
- You found us.
- Yes, I did.

05:10.343 --> 05:11.811
I'm gonna audition again.

05:11.878 --> 05:13.880
- Whoa! Super preggers.
- Whoa.

05:13.980 --> 05:17.450
- Yeah.
- Awesome. Congrats.

05:17.517 --> 05:18.484
- Can I? No.
- No.

05:18.551 --> 05:21.287
- That's not cool, is it?
- It's okay. Thank you.

05:21.354 --> 05:22.522
Come on, please.

05:22.622 --> 05:24.023
Just--

05:24.123 --> 05:25.558
just no Shakespeare.

05:25.658 --> 05:28.227
We only perform Shakespeare.

05:28.328 --> 05:29.295
Let him.

05:29.362 --> 05:32.632
Sarah's still composing.
She's not paying attention.

05:32.699 --> 05:34.901
Come on, Dieter.

05:35.001 --> 05:36.302
Break a rule.

05:43.042 --> 05:44.377
- Fine.
- Yes!

05:45.978 --> 05:48.181
- Opening up auditions
for one time only

05:48.247 --> 05:52.885
to any content whatsoever,
not necessarily Shakespeare.

05:52.985 --> 05:56.589
- Do we even need
a new player?

05:56.689 --> 05:57.357
You never know.

06:07.934 --> 06:09.736
- Come on, Dan.
Fifth time's a charm.

06:09.836 --> 06:11.604
You got this.

06:22.181 --> 06:23.783
Good morning.

06:23.883 --> 06:26.719
all: Good morning!

06:29.555 --> 06:31.124
In less than an hour,

06:31.224 --> 06:33.426
an aircraft from here will join
others from around the world.

06:35.928 --> 06:38.598
Perhaps it's fate

06:38.698 --> 06:40.900
that today is
the Fourth of July

06:40.967 --> 06:42.802
and you will once again be
fighting for our freedom.

06:46.139 --> 06:50.743
Not from tyranny,
oppression, or persecution,

06:50.810 --> 06:54.080
but from annihilation.

06:54.147 --> 06:56.816
We're fighting
for our right to live,

06:56.916 --> 06:58.918
to exist.

06:58.985 --> 07:02.789
And should we win the day,

07:02.889 --> 07:05.425
the Fourth of July
will no longer be known,

07:05.491 --> 07:07.994
as an American holiday,

07:08.094 --> 07:11.931
but as the day when the world
declared in one voice,

07:11.998 --> 07:13.900
we will not go quietly
into the night!

07:13.966 --> 07:16.002
- No.
- Right.

07:16.102 --> 07:18.004
- We will not vanish
without a fight!

07:18.104 --> 07:19.172
- Yeah!
- We're going to live on!

07:19.272 --> 07:22.175
- Yes!
- We're going to survive!

07:22.275 --> 07:23.342
Yeah!

07:23.443 --> 07:24.911
Today, we celebrate

07:24.977 --> 07:27.013
our Independence Day!

07:48.868 --> 07:51.504
Come on.

07:51.604 --> 07:52.438
So?

07:54.941 --> 07:56.275
- Yeah, man.
Let's make magic.

07:57.143 --> 07:59.212
- I got the job?
- Yes!

07:59.312 --> 08:01.881
- I'm in
the Traveling Symphony?

08:01.981 --> 08:05.051
- Are you serious? I'm in?
- Congratulations!

08:05.151 --> 08:06.886
- Oh, my God.
Thank you.

08:06.986 --> 08:08.321
Seriously.

08:08.387 --> 08:11.357
Welcome to the family.

08:11.457 --> 08:13.893
Oh! Yes, yes, yes!

08:13.993 --> 08:17.497
<i>all: </i>

09:03.743 --> 09:05.912
It's my 20th symphony.

09:06.012 --> 09:07.113
Oh, did you finish?

09:07.213 --> 09:10.116
Ugh, harder every time.

09:10.216 --> 09:12.618
How do you feel?

09:12.718 --> 09:15.788
- They should make me a saint.
Like St. Deborah.

09:15.888 --> 09:17.290
- Well, you didn't die
in a chemical fire.

09:17.390 --> 09:22.295
I die every year composing.

09:22.395 --> 09:24.463
- Hey, Kirsten!
- Kirsten!

09:24.564 --> 09:26.432
- Hey.
- Hi!

09:28.267 --> 09:30.570
I don't like "Hamlet."

09:30.636 --> 09:31.771
Ha!

09:31.871 --> 09:33.940
That's always been
your process.

09:34.040 --> 09:37.877
- Hi.

09:40.613 --> 09:42.315
Shakespeare people!

09:42.415 --> 09:46.152
Welcome back
to St. Deborah-by-the-Water.

09:46.252 --> 09:47.787
Is Kirsten here?

09:47.887 --> 09:49.455
- You all really liked
"Romeo and Juliet"

09:49.555 --> 09:50.957
last year, huh?

09:52.959 --> 09:55.127
Kirsten!

09:55.227 --> 09:57.163
Hey.

09:57.263 --> 10:00.633
You wanna go
on a little prop run?

10:00.733 --> 10:01.734
- Yeah.
- Okay. Come on.

10:05.104 --> 10:07.840
Are you okay?

10:07.940 --> 10:10.509
I know these woods
make you think of Jeevan.

10:10.610 --> 10:12.912
- Hmm?
Yeah, I'm fine.

10:12.979 --> 10:14.080
Okay, go. What's your question
about the phone?

10:14.146 --> 10:18.985
So I press the button.

10:19.085 --> 10:21.120
Then?

10:21.187 --> 10:23.155
- Then an entire map
of the area

10:23.255 --> 10:26.092
and all the cars comes up.

10:26.158 --> 10:30.796
- Okay, so then I press,
"I want a ride."

10:30.863 --> 10:32.698
"I want a ride."

10:32.798 --> 10:37.637
And something happens
in a car nearby?

10:37.703 --> 10:40.139
They can see where we are?

10:40.206 --> 10:42.274
- Yeah, and then they come
and pick you up,

10:42.341 --> 10:46.379
and they take you anywhere.

10:46.479 --> 10:47.813
Okay.

10:47.880 --> 10:50.182
So how many plays fit
on this one?

10:50.282 --> 10:53.119
Alex, every play.

10:53.185 --> 10:57.289
All of the plays fit on it.

10:57.356 --> 11:00.459
- I wish I coulda had a phone.
- They weren't that great.

11:00.526 --> 11:02.561
- Okay, so let me
just read everything

11:02.662 --> 11:06.666
and speak to anyone, anywhere.

11:08.634 --> 11:10.836
I asked Sayid
to come swimming with us.

11:10.903 --> 11:11.971
<i>- We've had no contact</i>
<i>with Jeff</i>

11:12.038 --> 11:16.909
<i>or any of our team in Moscow</i>
<i>for over 20 hours now.</i>

11:17.009 --> 11:20.746
<i>We are going to head over</i>
<i>to our office in Los Angeles.</i>

11:20.846 --> 11:22.581
<i>- Hi. You have reached</i>
<i>Catherine Raymonde.</i>

11:22.682 --> 11:25.484
<i>I'm not available</i>
<i>to take your call.</i>

11:25.551 --> 11:26.552
<i>Leave me a message,</i>

11:26.652 --> 11:28.587
<i>or to reach my assistant,</i>
<i>press two.</i>

11:28.688 --> 11:30.256
<i>- Reports of an excess</i>
<i>of 10,000 deaths</i>

11:30.356 --> 11:32.758
<i>coming in tonight</i>

11:32.858 --> 11:36.028
<i>from whatever county officials</i>
<i>we can find.</i>

11:36.829 --> 11:39.365
Maybe you should turn it off.

11:39.432 --> 11:40.933
<i>- The speed at which</i>
<i>this virus kills...</i>

11:41.033 --> 11:42.902
- There hasn't been any news
on the Ferris wheel.

11:43.002 --> 11:47.006
<i>- Experts believe that it's</i>
<i>got a kill rate of over 99%.</i>

11:47.073 --> 11:49.108
- Imagine dying like that.

11:49.208 --> 11:52.445
- Well, the way I see it,
the power is on.

11:52.545 --> 11:54.947
Things will be back to normal
in a couple of days.

11:55.047 --> 11:55.881
<i>Hey, this is Jim.</i>

11:55.948 --> 11:57.249
<i>I can't get</i>
<i>to the phone right now,</i>

11:57.349 --> 11:58.784
<i>but I'll call you back</i>
<i>when I can.</i>

11:58.884 --> 11:59.785
<i>Go, Cubs.</i>

12:02.888 --> 12:04.757
<i>- Hi. You have reached</i>
<i>Catherine Raymonde.</i>

12:04.857 --> 12:06.459
<i>Yes, that's correct, Tina.</i>

12:27.413 --> 12:32.585
Kirsten, maybe...

12:32.651 --> 12:34.286
do you wanna get some sleep?

12:34.386 --> 12:36.789
There is a spare bedroom.

12:41.627 --> 12:44.497
- I'll tell you
when my parents call.

12:44.597 --> 12:47.500
Good night, Jeevan.
Good night, Frank.

13:21.867 --> 13:23.469
- Whoo-hoo!

13:28.107 --> 13:29.842
Check inside the cabin?

13:31.644 --> 13:34.113
You see any ghosts this year?

13:37.616 --> 13:40.853
I looked in the window.

13:40.953 --> 13:43.022
It's the same, as always.

13:43.122 --> 13:44.890
There's no sign of him.

13:50.830 --> 13:53.232
Oh, wow.

13:53.332 --> 13:55.367
Look how clear it is.
You can see Chicago.

13:55.467 --> 13:57.736
- Every time I think
my first 100 days were bad,

13:57.837 --> 14:01.407
I remember you walked
across Lake Michigan.

14:03.742 --> 14:04.410
<i>Let's get to the lake.</i>

14:09.648 --> 14:13.853
<i>Frank, I'm opening the door.</i>

14:13.919 --> 14:15.588
<i>Frank, is that okay?</i>

14:22.761 --> 14:25.097
Where's Alex?

14:25.197 --> 14:26.765
I don't know.

14:26.866 --> 14:29.935
- Did you see where she went?
- No.

14:32.004 --> 14:33.339
<i>Jeevan!</i>

14:39.245 --> 14:41.747
What?

14:45.851 --> 14:46.018
Strangers.

14:51.223 --> 14:53.292
Kirst!

14:53.392 --> 14:54.693
Hey!

14:54.760 --> 14:57.129
Hey! Step away from him.

14:57.229 --> 14:58.864
- Kirsten, this David and--
- Come here.

14:58.931 --> 15:00.733
- What did they say to you?
- He said hi.

15:00.799 --> 15:02.201
And then I said hi.

15:07.139 --> 15:08.707
We're from Hamilton.

15:08.774 --> 15:10.976
We just passed
through St. Deborah's.

15:11.076 --> 15:13.946
Found out that the Symphony
was on the way.

15:14.046 --> 15:15.648
We had to stick around.

15:18.651 --> 15:19.718
- Hey, hey, hey, hey.
They're fine. They're fine.

15:19.785 --> 15:23.822
I met them
back with the troupe.

15:23.923 --> 15:25.324
- We actually saw you perform
up in Mackinac Island

15:25.424 --> 15:28.494
ten years ago.

15:28.594 --> 15:32.498
We're just...huge fans.

15:35.601 --> 15:37.636
What plays did you see?

15:45.945 --> 15:48.781
- "Coriolanus"
and "Taming of the Shrew."

15:54.853 --> 15:55.921
- Okay.

16:00.826 --> 16:02.461
Should we have some snacks?

16:04.163 --> 16:07.032
- Want some mushrooms?
Picked them along the way.

16:07.132 --> 16:08.534
- Whoo-hoo!

16:08.634 --> 16:11.370
Chicken of the Woods.

16:11.470 --> 16:13.839
I used to eat them
when I was a kid.

16:13.939 --> 16:15.374
Harder to find back then.

16:22.982 --> 16:24.616
Cody's mom died out there?

16:24.683 --> 16:26.218
In Detroit?

16:28.654 --> 16:31.890
You must have felt
so desperate.

16:31.991 --> 16:33.993
She's sick,
and you fell and got hurt?

16:36.395 --> 16:38.897
- She was gone by the time that
I got back to her and Cody.

16:42.835 --> 16:45.004
I guess I'd had some idea
that we'd find some medicine

16:45.070 --> 16:48.240
for my wife.

16:48.340 --> 16:50.409
I'm not sure
I can raise Cody right,

16:50.509 --> 16:52.378
you know, out here
without a mom.

16:54.847 --> 16:58.917
Isn't he, like, 17 or 18?

17:02.488 --> 17:05.858
He's pretty much raised.

17:05.924 --> 17:06.992
Also, how old are you?

17:10.529 --> 17:12.364
Tell me your wife's name.

17:12.431 --> 17:14.199
I'll sing a dirge
for her tonight.

17:16.268 --> 17:18.670
Rose.

17:18.737 --> 17:20.406
She was a good mother.

17:25.377 --> 17:29.281
A part of me thinks we were
better off all getting killed.

17:32.184 --> 17:34.219
- Uh-oh. Red.

17:37.790 --> 17:41.193
- All right,
now we really have to go.

17:41.260 --> 17:43.562
Four hours to curtain call.

17:43.629 --> 17:45.297
- May I ask you
about those tattoos?

17:49.568 --> 17:51.770
What's the symbol?

17:51.870 --> 17:54.940
- It's for all the people
I've killed.

17:55.040 --> 17:57.476
Alex, I'm just gonna do
a quick perimeter sweep.

17:57.576 --> 18:00.646
To the monsters,

18:00.746 --> 18:03.315
we're the monsters.

18:03.415 --> 18:04.716
I guess.

18:08.787 --> 18:10.255
Where did you hear that?

18:12.958 --> 18:14.726
It just came into my head.

18:40.619 --> 18:43.856
See you at the premiere.

19:22.628 --> 19:26.031
<i>Jeevan! Frank!</i>

19:26.131 --> 19:28.167
- Kirsten, run.
Right now.

19:28.233 --> 19:29.735
<i>Lock the door.</i>

19:42.147 --> 19:46.084
- Wanna see your knives
for this season?

19:46.185 --> 19:47.085
Yeah.

19:52.758 --> 19:56.195
I'd say...boot, right?

19:56.261 --> 19:59.097
For the switchblade?

19:59.198 --> 20:01.166
Hmm.

20:01.233 --> 20:03.202
This likes me well.

20:03.268 --> 20:04.937
- I'll have Chrys
sew the rest in.

20:07.272 --> 20:08.674
Are you okay?

20:08.740 --> 20:11.243
I'm good.

20:45.644 --> 20:47.546
<i>What would you have done</i>

20:47.613 --> 20:49.314
<i>if you knew</i>
<i>the flu was coming?</i>

20:51.950 --> 20:55.654
<i>- I would have</i>
<i>come home earlier from LA.</i>

20:55.754 --> 20:59.491
<i>How about you?</i>

20:59.591 --> 21:02.094
<i>Say goodbye to Arthur.</i>

21:02.160 --> 21:05.831
<i>I didn't get to say goodbye</i>
<i>to anyone.</i>

21:11.169 --> 21:14.840
- Hey.
- Hey.

21:14.940 --> 21:18.510
Um, this one.
Thank you.

21:32.124 --> 21:34.593
<i>You came to the right town.</i>

21:34.660 --> 21:37.262
Deborah's vernal spirit
guides us both.

21:37.329 --> 21:38.864
You build life, we bridge.

21:38.964 --> 21:40.832
Yeah, I'd hoped to get

21:40.932 --> 21:42.200
a last performance
from you both,

21:42.301 --> 21:44.269
but it wasn't meant to be.

21:44.336 --> 21:45.270
What wasn't?

21:50.609 --> 21:53.378
- I'm gonna check on the--
- I'm gonna go work on casting.

21:53.478 --> 21:54.880
- Thing.
- Okay.

22:03.655 --> 22:07.392
What?

22:07.492 --> 22:08.226
What?

22:09.995 --> 22:14.533
We're getting off the wheel.

22:14.633 --> 22:16.335
We're gonna stay here
for the year.

22:19.504 --> 22:21.473
I didn't wanna say anything
until I knew.

22:26.011 --> 22:27.579
Karen thinks, you know,

22:27.679 --> 22:32.584
the newborn out there
on the road isn't safe.

22:32.684 --> 22:33.819
Who the fuck is Karen?

22:33.885 --> 22:37.923
The midwife.

22:38.023 --> 22:41.660
What about...wolves here?

22:41.727 --> 22:43.528
What if a wolf ate the baby?

22:43.595 --> 22:46.264
- Okay.
This is why I didn't tell you.

22:46.365 --> 22:46.565
Why?

22:46.665 --> 22:50.035
Ahh!

22:50.102 --> 22:52.003
Ooh.

22:52.070 --> 22:54.272
- Oh, shit.
- Ooh.

22:54.373 --> 22:58.110
- What--um...
- Ooh.

22:58.210 --> 23:00.946
- Karen!

23:01.046 --> 23:02.748
Karen!

23:02.848 --> 23:05.117
Dan, welcome to the Symphony.

23:05.217 --> 23:07.252
- Peter, I'm so--
- We have an emergency.

23:07.352 --> 23:10.222
We're gonna need you to play
Queen Gertrude tonight.

23:10.288 --> 23:12.791
Of the seven possible Gertrudes
skill-wise,

23:12.891 --> 23:13.725
three are critical musicians

23:13.792 --> 23:15.394
for the conductor's
brilliant new score,

23:15.460 --> 23:18.230
two refuses to do "Hamlet"
because of Gil--

23:18.296 --> 23:19.398
Who's Gil?

23:19.464 --> 23:21.633
- Can't get into it.
Is that a yes?

23:21.733 --> 23:23.468
I have to say yes?

23:23.568 --> 23:24.603
Yes.

23:34.413 --> 23:36.081
What's happening with Alex?

23:36.148 --> 23:38.083
I heard she's with Sayid now.

23:38.150 --> 23:41.319
- Did Jeremy talk you into it?
Jeremy and Karen?

23:41.420 --> 23:44.890
- You know Jeremy is just
in Jeremy's world.

23:44.956 --> 23:46.158
- This is why
I don't date actors.

23:46.258 --> 23:50.061
- You dated me.
And Jeremy.

23:50.128 --> 23:53.131
Okay, okay.
Hey, hey. Stop.

23:53.231 --> 23:54.566
- What?
- Stop.

24:00.772 --> 24:03.108
I wanna stay.

24:03.175 --> 24:06.311
The Symphony is my family.

24:06.411 --> 24:08.013
You too.

24:08.113 --> 24:12.684
It doesn't end
because I take a season off.

24:12.784 --> 24:14.686
We've never been apart.

24:14.786 --> 24:15.687
Since Year Three.

24:15.787 --> 24:18.356
I know.

24:18.457 --> 24:22.427
- It would be better
for the Symphony if you came.

24:22.961 --> 24:26.198
With the baby!

24:26.298 --> 24:28.200
You are an amazing Gertrude.

24:28.300 --> 24:30.836
Being a mother would only
make that more true.

24:30.936 --> 24:32.370
This is a choice.

24:32.471 --> 24:33.004
What?

24:33.104 --> 24:35.674
It's selfish.

24:35.774 --> 24:37.642
I'm starting a family.

24:37.709 --> 24:40.378
- You just said
the Symphony was your family.

24:51.022 --> 24:51.890
Look, can she get you
the rest of the way there?

24:51.990 --> 24:55.727
I should go help.

24:55.827 --> 24:57.896
Break a leg.

24:57.996 --> 25:01.166
Deliver...the baby.

25:03.368 --> 25:05.036
Here we go. Okay.

25:17.349 --> 25:20.852
- Who's there?
- Nay, answer me.

25:20.919 --> 25:22.687
Stand, and unfold yourself.

25:22.754 --> 25:24.656
Long live the king.

25:24.723 --> 25:26.992
<i>- Bernardo?</i>
<i>- He.</i>

25:29.561 --> 25:33.064
- 'Tis now struck twelve.
Get thee to bed, Francisco.

25:33.164 --> 25:35.901
- Hi.
- Hey.

25:37.502 --> 25:39.104
I can't go on.

25:39.204 --> 25:39.938
How am I supposed
to play Gertrude?

25:40.038 --> 25:42.941
I'm not a mom.

25:43.041 --> 25:44.776
- My mom's gone.
- Okay.

25:44.876 --> 25:48.213
Have you ever heard
of Arthur Leander, from before?

25:49.414 --> 25:52.918
- The Orion Soldier?
- Yeah, yes.

25:53.018 --> 25:54.085
Okay.

25:54.185 --> 25:54.786
So he gave me
my first acting lesson.

25:54.886 --> 25:57.188
Ready?

25:57.255 --> 25:57.789
It's not about you.

26:00.358 --> 26:02.427
<i>- That's it?</i>
<i>- It works.</i>

26:04.262 --> 26:06.631
Put all of your attention
on the other person.

26:06.731 --> 26:09.534
So you're Gertrude,
and you are,

26:09.601 --> 26:10.969
but your concern is
your son, Hamlet.

26:13.204 --> 26:16.207
<i>You put all your focus on me,</i>
<i>and it'll free you up.</i>

26:16.274 --> 26:18.810
I promise.

26:18.910 --> 26:20.612
- Okay?
- Yeah.

26:20.712 --> 26:23.381
Okay. Let's make magic.

26:35.894 --> 26:40.899
- Have you your father's leave?
What says Polonius?

26:40.966 --> 26:45.971
- He hath, my Lord,
wrung from me my slow leave

26:46.071 --> 26:47.672
by laborsome petition,

26:47.772 --> 26:49.608
and, at last, upon his will,

26:49.674 --> 26:53.178
I sealed my hard consent.

26:53.278 --> 26:54.980
I do beseech you,

26:55.080 --> 26:58.650
give him leave to go.

26:58.750 --> 27:00.518
And now, Laertes,

27:00.619 --> 27:03.688
you told us of some suit.

27:03.788 --> 27:05.357
My dread Lord,

27:05.457 --> 27:07.759
your leave and favor
to return to France,

27:07.826 --> 27:09.995
from whence though willingly
I came to Denmark

27:10.095 --> 27:12.998
to show my duty
in your coronation,

27:13.098 --> 27:14.599
yet now, I must confess,
that duty done...

27:16.368 --> 27:17.702
<i>My thoughts and wishes</i>
<i>bend again toward France</i>

27:17.802 --> 27:21.873
<i>and bow them to your</i>
<i>gracious leave and pardon.</i>

27:21.973 --> 27:24.809
- Have you your father's leave?
What says Polonius?

27:24.876 --> 27:29.447
- He hath, my Lord,
wrung from me my slow leave.

27:29.514 --> 27:30.649
Hmm.

27:30.715 --> 27:35.553
But now, my cousin, Hamlet,
and my son--

27:38.356 --> 27:41.960
A little more than kin,

27:42.027 --> 27:44.562
and less than kind.

27:44.663 --> 27:48.166
- How is it the clouds
still hang on you?

27:50.001 --> 27:51.503
Not so, my Lord.

27:51.569 --> 27:53.838
I am too much in the sun.

27:56.074 --> 27:58.076
Good Hamlet,

27:58.176 --> 28:01.413
cast thy nighted color off

28:01.513 --> 28:04.983
and let thine eye
look like a friend on Denmark.

28:09.854 --> 28:12.390
Do not forever
with thy veiled lids

28:12.490 --> 28:16.094
seek thy noble father
in the dust.

28:16.194 --> 28:19.531
Thou know'st 'tis common.

28:19.597 --> 28:21.199
All that lives must die,

28:21.266 --> 28:22.834
<i>passing through nature</i>
<i>to eternity.</i>

28:31.009 --> 28:32.944
Ay, Madam.

28:33.044 --> 28:36.548
It is common.

28:36.614 --> 28:38.850
If it be,

28:38.917 --> 28:40.218
why seem it
so particular with thee?

28:53.732 --> 28:56.735
She still hasn't eaten.

28:56.801 --> 28:58.303
Three days.

29:11.483 --> 29:13.485
- Kirsten.

29:13.585 --> 29:16.621
Come on.
You gotta come out and eat.

29:18.823 --> 29:21.960
I know it's scary,
but you gotta eat.

29:22.060 --> 29:23.928
<i>If it be, why seem it</i>

29:23.995 --> 29:26.431
<i>so particular for thee?</i>

29:26.498 --> 29:28.133
- Kirsten, come on.
Open the door.

29:28.233 --> 29:31.102
<i>"Seems," Madam?</i>

29:33.505 --> 29:35.740
Nay.

29:35.807 --> 29:37.509
<i>- Kirsten.</i>
- It is.

29:37.609 --> 29:40.178
<i>- Hey, Kirsten.</i>

29:40.278 --> 29:42.580
I know not "seems."

29:42.647 --> 29:45.517
<i>- Kirsten, come on.</i>

29:50.188 --> 29:51.689
Kirsten.

29:51.790 --> 29:54.092
- Kirsten, what's going on?

29:54.159 --> 29:57.195
Open the door.

29:57.295 --> 29:59.364
<i>Kirsten.</i>

29:59.464 --> 30:00.165
- 'Tis...

30:00.265 --> 30:02.333
<i>Kirsten.</i>

30:02.433 --> 30:04.536
- 'Tis not alone
my inky cloak,

30:04.636 --> 30:06.337
good mother,

30:06.437 --> 30:09.007
<i>nor customary suits</i>
<i>of solemn black.</i>

30:09.107 --> 30:12.110
Nor...

30:12.177 --> 30:15.313
windy suspiration
of forced breath,

30:15.380 --> 30:18.650
<i>together with all moods,</i>

30:18.716 --> 30:24.055
forms, shapes of grief
that can denote me truly.

30:33.898 --> 30:36.835
I got weird texts.

30:51.316 --> 30:54.886
These indeed seem,

30:54.986 --> 30:58.323
for they are actions
that a man might play.

31:03.094 --> 31:07.098
- Hey, why don't you come
out here with Frank and me?

31:07.198 --> 31:09.067
- I don't even know
how many days it is

31:09.167 --> 31:11.236
until Christmas.

31:11.336 --> 31:13.538
Well, uh,

31:13.605 --> 31:17.775
we got a calendar, and...

31:17.876 --> 31:20.745
we'll figure it out.

31:20.845 --> 31:24.782
It's--what is it?
12, 11 days?

31:24.883 --> 31:27.285
Right. 11.

31:33.725 --> 31:35.193
- It's okay.
It's okay.

31:40.198 --> 31:41.933
It's all right.

31:43.902 --> 31:47.906
But I have that within
which passeth show.

31:52.143 --> 31:55.813
These but the trappings
and the suits of woe.

31:59.384 --> 32:01.753
Everyone's dead.

32:08.259 --> 32:12.163
Hey.

32:12.263 --> 32:14.132
Not everyone.

32:40.625 --> 32:41.092
Bravo!

32:43.628 --> 32:44.095
Bravo.

33:12.056 --> 33:13.524
No.

33:33.711 --> 33:34.746
Hey.

33:37.515 --> 33:38.816
Hey.

33:38.883 --> 33:39.917
- Can I help you?
- Yes, please.

33:44.222 --> 33:46.557
Excuse me.

33:46.657 --> 33:50.094
You seem--

33:50.194 --> 33:54.232
You seem to be
in charge here, correct?

33:54.332 --> 33:54.665
Yes.

33:57.535 --> 34:00.071
I am an emissary

34:00.171 --> 34:02.340
from a community that has,
until now,

34:02.407 --> 34:04.876
never once revealed
its existence

34:04.942 --> 34:07.245
to the rest of the world.

34:07.345 --> 34:09.781
And, uh, I...

34:09.881 --> 34:12.583
I come to you
with an invitation.

34:20.858 --> 34:23.594
It's our first invitation.

34:27.732 --> 34:30.601
We invite
the Traveling Symphony

34:30.701 --> 34:34.038
to visit us
at the Museum of Civilization.

34:36.274 --> 34:39.143
- What's the Museum
of Civilization?

34:39.243 --> 34:43.314
- A place that values
human culture and the past.

34:43.414 --> 34:46.250
Fuck the past.

34:49.420 --> 34:50.988
We never leave the wheel.

34:58.930 --> 35:02.733
all:

35:02.800 --> 35:05.303
I like the name of your town.

35:10.942 --> 35:12.009
She's got Daddy's nose.

35:12.110 --> 35:14.846
- Hopefully Mommy's brain.
- Yeah.

35:14.946 --> 35:16.914
- I'm gonna go drink
with the guys.

35:16.981 --> 35:18.015
- Mm-hmm.

35:26.924 --> 35:30.695
I was being selfish.

35:30.795 --> 35:32.463
Not selfish.

35:32.530 --> 35:35.099
- Sad.
- Mm-hmm.

35:37.502 --> 35:39.871
I'm sad.

35:39.971 --> 35:41.672
But it's not goodbye.

35:41.772 --> 35:44.542
You'll be back.
I'll be here.

35:44.642 --> 35:47.612
You don't know that.

35:51.149 --> 35:55.653
<i>- I know that</i>
<i>when someone goes or...</i>

35:57.955 --> 36:00.057
<i>Someone dies,</i>

36:00.158 --> 36:02.360
<i>I know how hard that is</i>
<i>for you.</i>

36:04.462 --> 36:05.830
Kirsten.

36:11.002 --> 36:13.671
I want it to be different
for her.

36:18.543 --> 36:19.343
I understand.

36:47.038 --> 36:49.006
So did Karen actually
do anything, or no?

36:49.073 --> 36:50.107
Not much.

36:54.212 --> 36:58.115
- Everyone.
Everyone, everyone.

36:58.216 --> 37:02.620
Thank you to all the midwives
and doulas

37:02.720 --> 37:04.422
from the birth center.

37:08.693 --> 37:11.929
This is where the wheel begins.

37:12.029 --> 37:14.265
And every summer,
it's the same.

37:14.365 --> 37:17.735
The Traveling Symphony
comes back...

37:20.238 --> 37:23.241
And Kirsten Raymonde
brings down the house.

37:23.307 --> 37:26.210
- Yeah!

37:29.747 --> 37:31.749
I met a new friend today.

37:31.816 --> 37:36.153
And I promised him
I'd sing a dirge for his wife.

37:36.254 --> 37:39.390
But this is for all of you
and all of the lost.

37:51.168 --> 37:52.837
I like ghosts.

37:52.937 --> 37:54.572
You were really good tonight.

37:56.941 --> 37:59.510
- Who's in your tent
these days?

38:03.447 --> 38:04.615
No one.

38:36.781 --> 38:40.551
So you've moved?

38:40.651 --> 38:42.553
Into the closet?

38:42.653 --> 38:45.122
- I didn't wanna
stay in there.

38:45.189 --> 38:47.224
I get it.

38:47.325 --> 38:50.227
What's that?

38:50.328 --> 38:51.962
A book.

38:52.029 --> 38:54.065
Arthur Leander gave it to me.

38:54.165 --> 38:55.900
It's the only copy.

39:16.887 --> 39:19.924
"I remember damage."

39:21.859 --> 39:24.328
Me too.

39:28.366 --> 39:31.936
"Then escape."

39:32.036 --> 39:33.838
Good story.

39:42.680 --> 39:44.281
<i>Love a good comeback.</i>

39:56.894 --> 39:58.095
Frank?

40:32.797 --> 40:34.965
- It's pronounced "Mack-in-aw,"

40:35.065 --> 40:38.402
not "Mack-in-ack," the island.

40:41.472 --> 40:44.642
Chicken of the Woods
don't grow up north.

40:48.779 --> 40:52.650
And...

40:52.750 --> 40:55.786
you're creepy.

40:55.853 --> 41:00.291
- You're charged
with that Day Zero pain.

41:00.357 --> 41:02.426
It's like you never left.

41:06.997 --> 41:11.302
You were incredible.

41:11.368 --> 41:14.171
Aww, really?

41:14.271 --> 41:17.374
Well, thank you.

41:17.475 --> 41:19.310
- It's important
that Cody and I join

41:19.376 --> 41:21.545
the Traveling Symphony.

41:21.645 --> 41:23.514
We won't be with you for long.

41:32.690 --> 41:35.826
No.

41:35.893 --> 41:37.895
- Then your friends are
gonna start to disappear.

41:37.995 --> 41:41.899
Alex. The Conductor.

41:41.999 --> 41:43.167
Charlie and Jeremy,

41:43.234 --> 41:44.568
they're staying back
with the baby, but--

41:47.838 --> 41:49.373
No.

42:03.687 --> 42:06.323
- Where did you hear
that line?

42:06.390 --> 42:07.024
"To the monsters,
we're the monsters."

42:07.091 --> 42:09.093
Where did you hear that?

42:13.664 --> 42:15.266
The prophecy.

42:30.781 --> 42:33.450
I remember...damage.

44:26.664 --> 44:27.631
<i>I remember damage.</i>

44:32.803 --> 44:34.571
Let's get you home.
