Man! Oh, no!

00:25.880 --> 00:27.416
We're getting
hammered out here!

Everything up!

-[Calvin] What the hell?
-[Chris] Is there somethin'
in there?

00:46.080 --> 00:48.958
[Chris] It's big!
It-- It's moving!

[men shouting]

00:51.080 --> 00:52.707
-[Xander] Chris!
-[Chris] No! It's right there!

00:52.710 --> 00:55.611
[indistinct shouting]

00:55.620 --> 00:57.451
Chris! Let's take 'em out!

00:59.330 --> 01:01.207
Shark?

01:01.210 --> 01:03.166
That ain't no shark!

01:03.170 --> 01:05.161
Xander? You see it?
It's over there!

01:08.000 --> 01:10.116
Come on, come on,
where are you at?

01:10.120 --> 01:11.200
Show yourself.

01:14.040 --> 01:15.371
Oh! Chris! Watch out!

Goin' your way, Cal!
Calvin, head it off!

01:19.380 --> 01:21.029

01:25.330 --> 01:27.378
-Oh, Xander!
-[Xander] Chris.

01:27.380 --> 01:29.996

01:35.000 --> 01:36.661
Come on!

01:36.670 --> 01:38.376
He's lost
a lot of blood, but...

Get in there good and tight.

03:07.620 --> 03:10.453
Let's see what you
caught tonight, Captain.

03:10.460 --> 03:13.327
What I caught is none
of your business!

03:13.330 --> 03:15.036
You're just here
for my injured crewman.

03:15.040 --> 03:16.610
Of course.

03:16.620 --> 03:17.951
We'll be needing him
as well.

to that catch!

Look what we found!

04:32.120 --> 04:34.532
Margaritas!

04:34.540 --> 04:36.997
Whoo!

04:37.000 --> 04:39.616
[girl] Do you want
a pretzel?!

04:39.620 --> 04:40.700
[bell rings]

04:42.040 --> 04:43.951
[crowd cheering]

04:43.960 --> 04:46.952
It was more
than 150 years ago

04:46.960 --> 04:48.996
when a local fishing captain,

04:49.000 --> 04:52.379
Charles H. Pownall,
fell in love with a mermaid

04:52.380 --> 04:53.995
in these very waters,

04:54.000 --> 04:56.958
enchanted by
her beautiful Siren song.

04:56.960 --> 04:58.416
I love you, fisherman.

04:58.420 --> 04:59.990
I love you, mermaid.

05:00.000 --> 05:02.286
But one day,
he went to the bay,

05:02.290 --> 05:04.531
and his mermaid was gone

05:04.540 --> 05:06.417
back to her home
In the sea,

05:06.420 --> 05:08.035
never to return.

05:08.040 --> 05:11.168
And that is how,
thanks to Charles H. Pownall,

05:11.170 --> 05:14.412
Bristol Cove became
the Mermaid Capital
of the World.

05:14.420 --> 05:17.116
[confetti cannons popping]

05:22.170 --> 05:24.377
Wow. Thank you.

05:24.380 --> 05:28.999
That was my great-great-great-
grandfather depicted there,

05:29.000 --> 05:32.413
so as you can see,
our family goes back
a long ways in Bristol Cove.

05:32.420 --> 05:35.617
Now please allow me to introduce
my beautiful wife Elaine

05:35.620 --> 05:37.872
and our two wonderful sons,
Doug and Ben.

05:37.880 --> 05:40.667
[applause]

05:40.670 --> 05:42.820
It seems, uh,

05:42.830 --> 05:44.878
Ben may have been caught up
in the parade traffic,

05:44.880 --> 05:47.667
but I can assure you
he is here in spirit.

05:47.670 --> 05:50.616
So to all the good people
of Bristol Cove,

05:50.620 --> 05:53.783
it is our great honor
to bestow this monument

05:53.790 --> 05:56.452
to one of our town's
founding fathers,

05:56.460 --> 05:59.452
Charles H. Pownall.

05:59.460 --> 06:01.246

-Where the hell's _Be_n? Hmm?
-[camera clicking]

06:09.040 --> 06:11.873
Now I don't know

06:11.880 --> 06:14.326
What tomorrow brings

06:14.330 --> 06:17.288
But I know one day

06:17.290 --> 06:19.952
I'll get what I need

06:25.580 --> 06:28.117
Hola! How'd it go?

06:28.120 --> 06:30.076
Rescued a Steller.

06:30.080 --> 06:31.456
She's in pretty bad shape.

06:31.460 --> 06:33.246
She's tagged.
She's one of ours.

06:33.250 --> 06:34.239
Where'd you find her?

06:34.250 --> 06:35.490
Out by Scott's Point.

06:35.500 --> 06:36.615
That's pretty far.

06:36.620 --> 06:38.030
Yeah, about 30 miles

06:38.040 --> 06:39.450
outside her usual range.

06:39.460 --> 06:41.166
Probably looking for food.

06:41.170 --> 06:43.240
[sea lion bellowing]

06:43.250 --> 06:44.740
Don't worry, girl.

06:44.750 --> 06:46.661
We're gonna take
good care of you.

06:46.670 --> 06:48.160
[high-pitched groans]

06:48.170 --> 06:50.240
Come on.

06:53.670 --> 06:54.955
She's starving out there.

06:54.960 --> 06:56.496
It's a good thing
we went out today.

06:56.500 --> 06:58.491
Not sure your dad
would agree with that.

06:58.500 --> 07:00.912
Well, I'll add that
to the list of things
we don't agree on.

07:00.920 --> 07:02.535
Like you and me
being together?

07:02.540 --> 07:07.534
Hey. Look, if I did
everything my dad told me,

07:07.540 --> 07:09.496
well, I'd be my brother.

07:10.620 --> 07:11.780
You want to come
over later?

07:11.790 --> 07:13.872
I promised my dad
I'd make him dinner.

07:13.880 --> 07:15.871
Third time this week?

07:15.880 --> 07:17.495
Luclq guy.

07:17.500 --> 07:19.206
He needs me.

07:19.210 --> 07:20.529
He'd be at the drive-thru
every night if I didn't cook.

07:20.540 --> 07:22.576
Seriously, it's disturbing.

07:22.580 --> 07:25.413
I could come by after
for dessert.

07:25.420 --> 07:26.910
Spend the night?

07:26.920 --> 07:28.456
If you want me to.

07:28.460 --> 07:29.996
What do you think?

07:32.790 --> 07:34.997
[music playing in bar]

07:39.710 --> 07:42.531
Hey, man.
Thought you guys were
out past Bowers Ridge.

07:42.540 --> 07:44.110
You're back early.

07:44.120 --> 07:47.499
Yeah. I need to talk to you
about something.

07:47.500 --> 07:48.535
All right.

07:48.540 --> 07:49.780
Boys.

07:51.920 --> 07:54.741
We said keep
this between us.
Don't tell anybody.

07:54.750 --> 07:56.661
Ben knows about this stuff,
all right?

07:56.670 --> 07:58.069
He can help us.

07:58.080 --> 07:59.536
He's one of us.

07:59.540 --> 08:00.780
He wasn't
on the boat with us.

08:00.790 --> 08:02.451
He doesn't fish
With us no more.

08:08.210 --> 08:10.280
We caught somethin'
out there.

08:10.290 --> 08:11.700
I mean,
it's just somethin' we...

08:11.710 --> 08:13.826
we ain't never seen before.

08:13.830 --> 08:15.616
It attacked Chris.

08:15.620 --> 08:17.497
He had
to get airlifted out,

08:17.500 --> 08:19.491
big-ass military
commando helicopter.

08:19.500 --> 08:21.661
Navy SEALs,
the whole deal.

08:21.670 --> 08:24.457
CG says they have
no record of the evac,

08:24.460 --> 08:26.701
like it never happened.

08:26.710 --> 08:27.574
He's just gone.

08:27.580 --> 08:30.071
What do you mean
he's gone?

08:30.080 --> 08:31.661
You really don't know
what attacked him?

08:31.670 --> 08:33.740
[Sean clears throat]

08:40.290 --> 08:41.951
A mermaid?

08:41.960 --> 08:43.666
It didn't
look like that, okay?

08:43.670 --> 08:46.958
This...
this was a predator.

08:49.420 --> 08:51.786
Okay, that was a good one.

08:51.790 --> 08:53.781
Yeah, very, very well done.

08:53.790 --> 08:55.030
You almost had me there.

08:55.040 --> 08:56.996
Dude, this is real.

08:57.000 --> 08:59.787
Hey, why else would they
take it from us, huh?

08:59.790 --> 09:01.576
Wait.

09:03.580 --> 09:05.036
Here. Look.

09:05.040 --> 09:06.951
Okay.

09:11.790 --> 09:14.076
Xander, man,
this could be anything.

09:15.420 --> 09:18.241
I don't know
what you call it,

09:18.250 --> 09:22.459
but, trust me, it's not
what you think it is.

09:33.880 --> 09:35.871
[Decker] We had a report
six weeks ago.

09:35.880 --> 09:37.700
Japanese fishermen claimed
they saw a sea creature

09:37.710 --> 09:39.109
off the Kuril Islands.

09:39.120 --> 09:41.281
Then some carcasses
washed ashore in Alaska

09:41.290 --> 09:43.372
with strange bite marks
all over them.

09:43.380 --> 09:45.530
Then five days ago,
our research vessel

09:45.540 --> 09:48.452
picked up unidentified
frequencies coming
from the Bering Strait.

09:48.460 --> 09:50.325
We knew something
was out there.

09:50.330 --> 09:51.661
That's when I alerted
your people.

09:51.670 --> 09:54.241
And you're sure this is
what you think it is?

09:54.250 --> 09:56.115
Well, Admiral...

09:56.120 --> 09:58.668
-[door opens]
-...why don't you
judge for yourself?

10:10.880 --> 10:16.159
[Siren song echoing]

10:21.120 --> 10:22.917
[knock on door]

10:24.670 --> 10:25.785
[Elaine]
Good morning, clear.

10:27.080 --> 10:30.868
Your father is
terribly angry with you.

10:30.880 --> 10:33.030
Good morning to you, too.

10:33.040 --> 10:35.611
Anthony?

10:35.620 --> 10:38.248
I don't give a rat's ass
if your father's angry.

10:38.250 --> 10:40.878
A lot of things
make him angry,

10:40.880 --> 10:42.416
like the fact that a woman
who can't walk

10:42.420 --> 10:45.207
insists
on buying $600 shoes.

10:45.210 --> 10:47.747
-You know what he called
me the other day?
-What?

10:47.750 --> 10:49.377
Bitch on wheels.

10:49.380 --> 10:51.951
That's actually pretty funny.

10:51.960 --> 10:54.246
I thought so, too.

10:54.250 --> 10:56.616
Do you know why it was okay?

10:56.620 --> 10:59.874
Because it was
behind closed doors.

10:59.880 --> 11:01.871
Family rule--

11:01.880 --> 11:04.326
you can say whatever the hell
awful thing you want in private,

11:04.330 --> 11:05.536
but in public...

11:07.080 --> 11:10.538
This is a face that keeps
Mommy in nice shoes.

11:10.540 --> 11:12.280
I get it.

11:12.290 --> 11:14.076
No, I don't think you do.

11:14.080 --> 11:17.072
Because if you did,
you'd show up.

11:20.380 --> 11:22.746
and you wouldn't leave
your father up on stage

11:22.750 --> 11:24.570
with his pants
around his ankles.

11:24.580 --> 11:26.411
You know what, Mom?

11:26.420 --> 11:29.537
If you guys want
to put a show on
for the whole town,

11:29.540 --> 11:31.701
that's your business,
but I...

11:31.710 --> 11:33.109
I don't want anything
to do with it.

11:33.120 --> 11:35.372
I got other things
to worry about.

11:36.750 --> 11:38.911
The spawning habits
of a bunch of plankton

11:38.920 --> 11:40.160
are more important
than family.

11:40.170 --> 11:41.876
That's not what I'm saying.

11:41.880 --> 11:45.953
And I really
_don't want to have_
this conversation again.

11:45.960 --> 11:48.781
Ben, I need this family
to keep working.

11:50.960 --> 11:53.702
And I'm not willing
to suffer for nothing.

11:56.830 --> 11:58.206
Okay, I hear you.

11:59.960 --> 12:03.111
Doug tells me that
you're hot and heavy
with Maddie Bishop.

12:03.120 --> 12:06.112
Yeah, we're dating.

12:06.120 --> 12:08.247
You always had a thing
for the wild girls.

12:08.250 --> 12:10.241
I gotta get
some stuff done.

12:10.250 --> 12:13.162
[door closes]

12:16.620 --> 12:19.453
Always had a thing
for the wild girls, huh?

12:19.460 --> 12:21.246
I'm sorry.

12:21.250 --> 12:22.820
She didn't know
you were in here.

12:22.830 --> 12:24.616
So if it weren't
for your brother,

12:24.620 --> 12:26.997
she wouldn't even know
we were seeing each other?

12:27.000 --> 12:28.991
Believe me,
with my family,

12:29.000 --> 12:31.912
nothing good
ever comes from sharing.

12:31.920 --> 12:35.378
You never know.
Your mom and I might
actually hit it off.

12:35.380 --> 12:37.666
Yeah, you might be right.

12:37.670 --> 12:41.037
I mean, you're
exactly the kind of girl
she'd want me to be with.

12:41.040 --> 12:43.326
Oh, yeah?
What kind of girl is that?

12:43.330 --> 12:45.036
Beautiful.

12:47.670 --> 12:48.739
Smart.

12:51.040 --> 12:52.200
Funny.

12:55.250 --> 12:56.410
Passionate.

12:56.420 --> 12:58.206
[chuckles]

12:58.210 --> 13:00.451
And that smile

13:00.460 --> 13:03.952
that could power
a small city.

13:03.960 --> 13:05.871
Ah, yes.

13:05.880 --> 13:08.451
Ah, that famous
Pownall charm.

13:17.460 --> 13:19.826
[rock music playing]

13:21.960 --> 13:24.076
Mm! No, dude, Aberdeen.

13:24.080 --> 13:26.958
The best weed is in Aberdeen.

13:26.960 --> 13:30.077
[laughs]
Seriously gourmet Kush.

13:30.080 --> 13:31.820
[laughter]

13:31.830 --> 13:33.457
[Jerry]
Even my mom likes it.

13:33.460 --> 13:36.247
I don't remember him being
such a burner in high school.

13:36.250 --> 13:38.457
Yeah, that was
more your crowd, right?

13:38.460 --> 13:40.280
Oh, all right, golden boy.

13:48.420 --> 13:50.741
Hey, I'll be back
in a minute.

13:50.750 --> 13:51.819
Okay.

13:58.540 --> 14:01.031
I swear I'm gonna kill you
if you go out too far!

14:06.960 --> 14:08.029
[Ben] Hey.

14:08.040 --> 14:10.577
You okay?

14:10.580 --> 14:13.492
You're not seriously pissed
at me, are you?

14:13.500 --> 14:14.910
I shouldn't have told you.

14:14.920 --> 14:16.535
Should have known better.

14:16.540 --> 14:17.996
Think about what
you're asking me to believe.

14:18.000 --> 14:19.740
I get it.
You don't come out

14:19.750 --> 14:21.160
_ on the boat
With us anymore.

14:21.170 --> 14:22.159
You weren't there.

14:22.170 --> 14:25.207
They took Chris.

14:25.210 --> 14:27.166
They don't want people
to know about this.

14:27.170 --> 14:30.037
Look, I don't know
what happened to Chris.

14:30.040 --> 14:32.531
Maybe he's
in a military hospital.

14:32.540 --> 14:34.610
We're gonna find him, Xan.

14:34.620 --> 14:37.032
This isn't part
of some huge cover-up,

14:37.040 --> 14:39.110
and it's not_ because
of some mythical creature

14:39.120 --> 14:40.326
that you guys think
that you caught.

14:40.330 --> 14:41.991
So you're telling me
you know everything

14:42.000 --> 14:43.956
-there is to know about--
-No, of course not!

14:43.960 --> 14:45.496
Then look me in the eye
and you tell me

14:45.500 --> 14:47.320
that maybe-- maybe there
is something down there

14:47.330 --> 14:48.706
that we haven't
seen before.

14:53.790 --> 14:56.281
-Xan. ..
-Just--

14:56.290 --> 14:58.497
Just do it.

14:58.500 --> 15:00.570
Okay.

15:00.580 --> 15:02.536
Sure.

15:02.540 --> 15:04.667
95% _of the oceans
remain unexplored.

15:04.670 --> 15:07.377
So it could happen?

15:07.380 --> 15:09.450
[ominous music playing]

15:12.000 --> 15:13.240
Xander, man, I love you.

15:13.250 --> 15:14.660
You know that.

15:14.670 --> 15:16.991
But as a friend,
I'm telling you,

15:17.000 --> 15:19.616
you gotta stop
talking like this.

15:19.620 --> 15:22.248
What would it take?

15:22.250 --> 15:24.878
Hmm?

15:24.880 --> 15:26.199
For you to believe me?

15:27.210 --> 15:28.871
I'd have to see one.

15:34.330 --> 15:35.570
That's it.

15:38.040 --> 15:39.496
That's exactly right.

15:41.080 --> 15:42.661
We gotta catch another one.

15:44.790 --> 15:46.371
[girl]
Lucas, get back here!

Shark! Shark! Shark!

16:10.880 --> 16:13.166
Aah! Aah!

16:13.170 --> 16:14.455
Shark!

16:20.210 --> 16:21.199
What are you thinking?

16:25.330 --> 16:27.912
[girl]
I can't even believe it.

16:27.920 --> 16:30.411
It's disgusting.

16:30.420 --> 16:34.288
This damage definitely
wasn't inflicted
by an orca.

16:34.290 --> 16:37.077
_The bite radius
is way too small.

16:37.080 --> 16:38.911
So what then?

16:38.920 --> 16:41.241
Well,
it's not another shark.

16:41.250 --> 16:43.161
_ _There are _
a million explanations.

16:43.170 --> 16:44.239
Okay?

16:44.250 --> 16:45.740
Caught in a boat prop,

16:45.750 --> 16:47.991
sea lion bit the carcass?

16:50.080 --> 16:53.243
What if there's
a new predator out there?

16:53.250 --> 16:55.070
One that we haven't
seen before?

16:55.080 --> 16:59.198
That can rip the head
clean off a mako shark?

16:59.210 --> 17:03.453
Then I might have to cancel
my scuba trip next weekend.

Is she having
trouble breathing?

17:55.000 --> 17:57.321
No, no, no,
her breathing's fine.

Are you sure?

18:01.330 --> 18:02.570
I mean, I'm happy
to drive her

18:02.580 --> 18:04.707
down to the hospital
in Port Angeles.

18:04.710 --> 18:06.450
[doctor] It's okay, Ben.
I'll meet you at your place.

18:06.460 --> 18:08.166
Okay. All right,
I'll see you there.

18:08.170 --> 18:09.535
Thanks, Dr. Abbott.

Now, I can help you.

19:05.170 --> 19:07.957
If you need
to get back somewhere.

She's in here.

just here.

from here to Alaska

and for You,

on her journey

and find her way back home.

It's been eight months
since we've heard from her.

to start dropping her
from the blessings.

That's okay.

27:52.080 --> 27:54.617
It's nice just to have
the company.

27:54.620 --> 27:56.281
Sometimes I'll pick up
a hitcher,

27:56.290 --> 27:59.077
but, uh,
they're mostly dudes.

Not a pretty little thing
like you.

Just call me angel

who don't know how to talk.

28:55.670 --> 28:57.786
Just touch my cheek
before you...

28:57.790 --> 28:59.997
Now, I bet
your mama told you,
"Don't get into cars

29:00.000 --> 29:01.069
with strangers."

29:01.080 --> 29:04.379
But you didn't listen.

Your skin's all dry.

29:18.420 --> 29:19.739
You ought to put
some cream on that,

29:19.750 --> 29:22.116
make it nice and soft.

Isn't that what you're
lookin' for? Huh?

This is a research
and rescue center

30:46.880 --> 30:49.451
for the many marine mammals
that inhabit our region.

30:49.460 --> 30:52.031
We're able to offer
veterinary care,

30:52.040 --> 30:55.032
perform surgical procedures,
and administer medication.

30:55.040 --> 30:57.110
What are all the TVs for?

30:57.120 --> 30:59.111
Those are so we can
keep an eye on our animals

30:59.120 --> 31:01.168
and what they're doing,
both in an out of the water.

31:02.040 --> 31:04.076
Yeah?

31:04.080 --> 31:05.490
When you were a kid,

31:05.500 --> 31:07.821
did you know you wanted
to work here?

31:07.830 --> 31:10.116
Actually, it was
a couple of years ago.

31:10.120 --> 31:13.169
I saw a video of a baby dolphin
that had washed ashore.

31:13.170 --> 31:14.956
Instead of helping it,
the people on the beach

31:14.960 --> 31:17.417
passed it around taking
their picture with it.

31:17.420 --> 31:19.820
Even after it died,
they kept taking selfies.

31:19.830 --> 31:22.788
That video made me sad,
and I wanted to do something,

31:22.790 --> 31:25.111
so I came here to volunteer.

31:25.120 --> 31:26.701
Now it's my job.

31:26.710 --> 31:29.167
You might be wondering
what our animals like to eat.

about her.

Come in.

What is it
you think I know?

That she's one of them.

39:38.500 --> 39:41.663
I saw it, tonight.

39:41.670 --> 39:43.490
What did you see?

39:45.540 --> 39:48.418
She changed in the water.

39:51.790 --> 39:53.872
Just like this.

39:53.880 --> 39:55.871
When we were kids,

39:55.880 --> 39:57.450
we'd come in here,

39:57.460 --> 39:59.530
and you'd tell us stories
about the mermaids.

39:59.540 --> 40:02.168

that they were
just tall tales,

40:02.170 --> 40:03.489

were they?

to know the truth.

all of a sudden?

In their natural state
in the water,

40:26.210 --> 40:28.997
they see you as prey.

Their instinct is to kill.
