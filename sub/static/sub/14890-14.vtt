01:21.615 --> 01:25.418
Well, looks like we’re all set
for grandpa’s visit.

01:27.621 --> 01:29.189
[sniffing]

01:34.595 --> 01:35.662
What’s that smell?

01:35.696 --> 01:38.098
Oh, those are my
hot and spicy goat lips.

01:39.165 --> 01:40.433
You made goat lips?

01:40.466 --> 01:43.236
Well, of course I did,
don’t be ridiculous.

01:44.505 --> 01:45.839
They are the
traditional Myposian

01:45.872 --> 01:47.641
grandparent welcoming dish.

01:47.674 --> 01:49.475
[oven dings]

01:49.510 --> 01:51.277
Oh, don’t want them
to get too crispy.

01:53.680 --> 01:55.849
And, cousin,
I thought after dinner

01:55.882 --> 01:58.519
we take him
to the Lithuanian circus.

01:58.552 --> 02:00.353
It’s audience
participation night.

02:03.189 --> 02:05.491
How is grandpapa Appleton
on the high‐wire?

02:05.526 --> 02:07.828
Well, hold your
Lithuanian horses.

02:07.861 --> 02:11.231
One diggy hot lips,
two diggy hot lips

02:11.264 --> 02:13.466
three diggy hot lips,
four diggy hot lips.

02:13.499 --> 02:15.669
Mwah, mwah, mwah.

02:15.702 --> 02:18.371
Five diggy hot lips,
six diggy hot lips.

02:18.404 --> 02:20.206
‐Seven diggy hot lips‐‐
‐Balki.

02:20.240 --> 02:22.709
‐You made me lose count.
‐Eight diggy hot lips.

02:24.410 --> 02:27.347
Balki, circuses
and hot diggy goat lips

02:27.380 --> 02:29.583
are gonna be too much
for grandpa.

02:29.616 --> 02:32.185
Well, we’re talking about
a 76‐year‐old widower

02:32.218 --> 02:34.555
who doesn’t get around
so well anymore.

02:34.588 --> 02:36.657
He’s a quiet,
frail old gentleman

02:36.690 --> 02:38.725
and we have
to treat him carefully.

02:38.759 --> 02:40.761
[knock on door]

02:40.794 --> 02:42.262
That must be him now.

02:47.634 --> 02:49.235
Hiya, Larry!

02:49.269 --> 02:50.403
Grandpa.

02:50.436 --> 02:51.538
[laughing]

02:54.875 --> 02:56.810
You must be Balki.

02:56.843 --> 02:58.478
Well, yes, I am.

03:01.014 --> 03:03.383
Welcome to our home,
Grandpapa Appleton.

03:03.416 --> 03:05.919
Thank you, Balki.

03:05.952 --> 03:09.990
Well, it’s not grandpa anymore,
it’s Buzz.

03:10.023 --> 03:11.692
Well, well, well,
l‐let’s sit down.

03:13.259 --> 03:16.530
Well, gee, it’s great
to see you, grandpa.

03:16.563 --> 03:19.465
Well, it’s good to see you,
Larry, uh...

03:19.499 --> 03:22.803
‐And it’s Buzz.
‐Buzz?

03:22.836 --> 03:25.639
What, what’s happened?
I‐I‐I hardly recognize you.

03:25.672 --> 03:29.375
Well, I dropped fifteen pounds
and got a new wardrobe.

03:29.409 --> 03:31.945
How do you like these B‐ball
shoes with the slam dunk pump?

03:34.815 --> 03:36.617
Bodacious, Buzz.

03:37.851 --> 03:39.319
[sniffing]

03:40.386 --> 03:41.988
What’s that delicious smell?

03:42.022 --> 03:44.290
Well,
those are my Myposian goat lips

03:44.324 --> 03:45.692
but Cousin Larry say that

03:45.726 --> 03:47.661
that they are too spicy for you,
Buzz.

03:47.694 --> 03:49.563
You know I always say, Balki,
there is no such thing

03:49.596 --> 03:52.966
as too rich,
too thin or too spicy.

03:52.999 --> 03:55.035
And I may say
there’s no such thing as

03:55.068 --> 03:59.806
too happy, too friendly
or too many pigs in your house.

03:59.840 --> 04:01.908
But that’s not putting
lips in your stomach.

04:01.942 --> 04:03.409
Let me get you some.

04:07.948 --> 04:10.350
You know what I’d really like,
Balki, uh...

04:11.718 --> 04:14.788
...is some of that famous
deep dish Chicago pizza.

04:14.821 --> 04:17.423
Oh, and, uh, maybe we can catch
that Lithuanian circus.

04:17.457 --> 04:18.625
I hear it’s in town.

04:18.659 --> 04:21.962
Well, feed me peanuts
and call me dumbo.

04:21.995 --> 04:23.630
That’s a brilliant idea.

04:23.664 --> 04:25.666
I... Isn’t it, cousin?

04:25.699 --> 04:28.401
Well, grandpa, wha‐wha‐what’s
happened to you?

04:28.434 --> 04:30.804
Uh, you never acted
like this before.

04:30.837 --> 04:32.372
I’ve never been this old before.

04:33.974 --> 04:38.311
Larry, I realize that the few
years I have left are precious

04:38.344 --> 04:40.814
and I don’t want to waste ’em.

04:40.847 --> 04:42.683
I want to meet some new people,
you know, and, uh

04:42.716 --> 04:44.685
have some new experiences.

04:44.718 --> 04:47.087
Went on a cruise,
had a terrific time.

04:47.120 --> 04:49.523
Even made a new friend, Sam.

04:49.556 --> 04:52.626
We had so much fun, we decided
to get together again.

04:52.659 --> 04:56.797
Sam lives in Chicago,
so, here I am.

04:56.830 --> 05:00.066
Well, I, I’m‐I’m glad to see
you’re enjoying yourself

05:00.100 --> 05:02.603
I, um, but I just think,
you know, someone your age

05:02.636 --> 05:04.638
should, you know,
take things a little slower.

05:04.671 --> 05:06.673
Larry, when you only
got a half the time

05:06.707 --> 05:08.542
you gotta go twice as fast.

05:08.575 --> 05:09.910
Where do I bunk?

05:09.943 --> 05:11.111
Oh, you, you’re using my room

05:11.144 --> 05:12.579
it’s, uh,
straight down the hall.

05:21.888 --> 05:25.626
Well, cousin,
Grandpapa Appleton is exactly

05:25.659 --> 05:27.928
the way you described him.

05:27.961 --> 05:32.566
Except for the, the clothes,
and the, uh, shoes

05:32.599 --> 05:35.035
and, uh,
the way you described him.

05:37.504 --> 05:39.372
I guess we won’t be needing
the hot water bottle

05:39.405 --> 05:41.542
and the prune juice you bought.

05:41.575 --> 05:43.443
Well, we can return
the hot water bottle.

05:43.476 --> 05:45.411
‐Oh, okay.
‐But the prune juice is for me.

05:46.880 --> 05:48.749
[instrumental music]

05:58.759 --> 05:59.893
[sighs]

06:02.896 --> 06:04.731
[laughing]

06:06.667 --> 06:09.636
Ah, what a day,
what a day, what a day.

06:09.670 --> 06:11.471
Didn’t I tell you guys
we would have a great time?

06:11.505 --> 06:14.107
‐Yeah.
‐I loved that wild log ride.

06:14.140 --> 06:16.142
Just like riding the rapids.

06:16.176 --> 06:18.645
Didn’t I tell you it would be
more fun standing up?

06:18.679 --> 06:20.413
[laughing]

06:22.448 --> 06:25.118
Oh, ho!
It’s almost 6 o’clock.

06:25.151 --> 06:26.853
Sam will be here any minute.

06:26.887 --> 06:28.522
I gotta pump up my shoes.

06:28.555 --> 06:29.923
[groans]

06:36.162 --> 06:39.165
Balki, what am I gonna
do with him?

06:39.199 --> 06:42.135
He’s my grandfather,
he’s acting like a teenager

06:42.168 --> 06:44.971
and you’re not helping.

06:45.005 --> 06:47.674
Alright, cousin, I have
had it up to here with you.

06:50.476 --> 06:52.613
There is absolutely
nothing wrong with a person

06:52.646 --> 06:54.648
acting as young as they feel.

06:54.681 --> 06:56.850
On Mypos, we always treat
the young as if they’re old

06:56.883 --> 06:58.519
so that they’ll gain wisdom.

06:58.552 --> 06:59.986
And we treat the old
as if they are young

07:00.020 --> 07:02.155
so that they’d gain vitality.

07:02.188 --> 07:04.558
Yeah, well, you also treat
your pigs to dinner and a movie

07:04.591 --> 07:06.459
so you’ll gain acceptance
from your livestock.

07:09.896 --> 07:11.898
Well, that is only during
the harvest season

07:11.932 --> 07:13.767
and I don’t see what that
has to do with with Buzz?

07:13.800 --> 07:17.538
Balki, sit down.

07:17.571 --> 07:20.874
This is America,
things are a little different.

07:20.907 --> 07:23.910
People know their age
and they act their age.

07:23.944 --> 07:26.012
That’s how they know
what to charge at the movies.

07:26.046 --> 07:27.548
Well, I don’t think
my best bud Buzz

07:27.581 --> 07:28.782
appreciates being put in a box‐‐

07:28.815 --> 07:30.483
Oh, he is not
your best bud Buzz.

07:30.517 --> 07:33.053
Oh, I beg to differ.
Excuse me, I beg to butt in.

07:33.086 --> 07:34.187
‐I beg to butt in.
‐No, he’s not you best bud.

07:34.220 --> 07:35.488
Excuse me, excuse me.

07:35.522 --> 07:36.557
‐I... but...
‐Look...

07:36.590 --> 07:37.758
Excuse me, he is...

07:37.791 --> 07:39.826
Buzz is my bosom buddy, booby.

07:39.860 --> 07:41.662
[indistinct chatter]

07:41.695 --> 07:44.665
Don’t give me that
’Best‐bud‐Buzz business,’ Balki.

07:46.733 --> 07:48.101
He is my grandfather.
I’ll deal with him.

07:51.738 --> 07:53.574
This is because you got wet,
isn’t it?

07:58.044 --> 07:59.846
I told you not to sit
in the front of the log.

08:02.783 --> 08:04.618
[knock on door]

08:04.651 --> 08:05.752
‐Get the door.
‐You get it.

08:07.721 --> 08:08.889
We’ll both get it.

08:13.927 --> 08:14.995
But you go first.

08:19.700 --> 08:20.934
It’s probably grandpa’s friend.

08:20.967 --> 08:22.569
Oh.

08:22.603 --> 08:24.971
You know...

08:25.005 --> 08:27.173
...hanging around with
some old guy his own age

08:27.207 --> 08:28.241
might settle him down.

08:29.643 --> 08:31.812
Hi, I’m Sam Morrison.

08:34.246 --> 08:35.716
Is Buzz here?

08:36.950 --> 08:38.083
You’re Sam?

08:38.118 --> 08:39.852
[chuckles]

08:39.885 --> 08:41.020
Yeah, Samantha.

08:42.923 --> 08:45.859
Well, come‐come on in,
come on in, uh... Uh...

08:47.794 --> 08:49.896
‐Buzz told us all about you.
‐Oh.

08:49.930 --> 08:51.297
Except that you were young
and a woman.

08:54.167 --> 08:56.202
‐Sam.
‐Buzzy.

08:56.236 --> 08:57.938
[laughing]

09:00.707 --> 09:03.910
Goodnight, guys. Sam and I are
goin’ out and paint the town.

09:05.178 --> 09:06.246
Don’t wait up.

09:08.381 --> 09:10.250
‐Woo!
‐Whoo!

09:14.921 --> 09:17.691
Well, she is younger
than my own mother.

09:17.724 --> 09:19.159
What can he be thinking?

09:25.298 --> 09:29.069
Well, cousin, I’m just
a simple Mypiot boy, but...

09:30.937 --> 09:32.673
...even I know
what he’s thinking.

09:34.374 --> 09:37.110
[instrumental music]

10:07.340 --> 10:08.842
You couldn’t sleep either?

10:13.013 --> 10:16.316
Balki,
I am worried about grandpa.

10:16.349 --> 10:19.820
Cousin, Buzz distinctly
told you not to wait up.

10:20.887 --> 10:23.023
Balki,
it is 2:30 in the morning.

10:23.056 --> 10:24.057
Ow.

10:25.391 --> 10:26.693
Where could he be?

10:28.094 --> 10:29.329
[snoring]

10:34.234 --> 10:36.036
[screams]

10:36.069 --> 10:37.170
Where could he be?

10:38.171 --> 10:39.673
Well, cousin...

10:42.242 --> 10:46.212
...Buzz and Sam probably
had a nice, romantic dinner.

10:46.246 --> 10:50.250
A little wine,
a moonlight walk by the lake

10:50.283 --> 10:52.385
and before they knew it

10:52.418 --> 10:54.655
one thing led to another,
and well...

10:56.923 --> 10:59.693
...they‐they found themselves
playing Donkey Kong

10:59.726 --> 11:01.294
at the all‐night video arcade.

11:07.433 --> 11:09.169
Well, where have you been?

11:09.202 --> 11:10.771
Do you have any idea
what time it is?

11:10.804 --> 11:11.972
I have been worried sick.

11:12.005 --> 11:13.874
I don’t want to talk about it.

11:13.907 --> 11:16.176
Well, you are just gonna
have to talk about it, mister.

11:20.480 --> 11:22.482
Buzz, didn’t you have fun?

11:22.516 --> 11:24.751
Oh, yeah,
we had a great evening.

11:24.785 --> 11:27.821
We dined, we danced.
Then, she dumped me.

11:29.355 --> 11:32.292
I‐I‐I’m‐I’m sorry, grandpa.

11:32.325 --> 11:35.862
She said all we had
was a shipboard romance.

11:35.896 --> 11:39.265
She said on dry land she didn’t
feel the Earth move anymore.

11:39.299 --> 11:40.934
She said, "Buzz off, Buzz."

11:43.303 --> 11:44.104
Well...

11:46.039 --> 11:49.142
Well, grandpa,
I‐I know how you feel.

11:49.175 --> 11:51.211
I’ve been dumped
a few times myself.

11:53.146 --> 11:54.214
Actually 44.

11:57.417 --> 11:58.919
Forty‐five.

12:01.154 --> 12:03.924
Well, maybe everything’s
worked out for the best.

12:03.957 --> 12:06.993
‐You think so?
‐I know so.

12:07.027 --> 12:09.395
I mean, the important thing
is you have your health.

12:09.429 --> 12:11.031
You have a family
that loves you.

12:12.298 --> 12:16.036
Women half your age,
nights on the town.

12:16.069 --> 12:19.272
That’s‐that’s for the young
and the foolish.

12:19.305 --> 12:21.875
Yeah, you’re right, Larry.

12:21.908 --> 12:24.978
There’s no fool
like an old fool.

12:25.011 --> 12:28.448
I’ve been trying
to be something I’m not...young.

12:30.951 --> 12:32.052
Oh.

12:34.287 --> 12:35.856
Goodnight, boys.

12:49.202 --> 12:51.237
Well, I think
that went pretty well.

12:53.073 --> 12:54.107
Yeah, cousin.

12:54.140 --> 12:56.276
You aged him more in 60 seconds

12:56.309 --> 12:58.879
than Mama Nature did
in 76 years.

13:06.920 --> 13:08.154
[instrumental music]

13:18.599 --> 13:21.434
Cousin, it’s a beautiful day.

13:24.437 --> 13:26.973
I’ve been thinking this
is a perfect opportunity

13:27.007 --> 13:29.009
to do something
to help Grandpapa Buzz.

13:29.042 --> 13:31.277
Now, we could take him
down to the lake

13:31.311 --> 13:33.547
he’d be basking
in the sunshine...

13:33.580 --> 13:37.050
[inhales]
Breathing in the fresh air,
and in no time at all he’ll be‐‐

13:37.083 --> 13:39.485
In the hospital
with pneumonia.

13:41.121 --> 13:43.323
Well, why don’t you
just burst my baboon?

13:45.491 --> 13:48.028
Cousin, we have to do something
to get Buzz back.

13:49.195 --> 13:52.165
Balki, there is no Buzz.

13:52.198 --> 13:55.301
There’s just Beaumont Appleton,
my grandfather.

13:55.335 --> 13:56.937
And there is nothing wrong
with an elderly man

13:56.970 --> 13:58.972
acting like an elderly man.

14:05.078 --> 14:08.314
Oh. Grandpapa Buzz.

14:08.348 --> 14:10.016
I’ve got a terrific idea.

14:10.050 --> 14:12.018
Why don’t we all
go down to the lake.

14:12.052 --> 14:13.887
We can have a nice picnic.

14:13.920 --> 14:15.488
I’ve got tons
of leftover goat lips.

14:15.522 --> 14:16.957
They are great cold.

14:16.990 --> 14:20.060
No. No, no, no,
no picnic for me, Balki.

14:20.093 --> 14:21.928
You boys go right ahead.

14:21.962 --> 14:25.431
I’ll just stay here
and have some weak tea.

14:25.465 --> 14:27.568
Okay, I’ll‐I’ll make it for you.

14:29.202 --> 14:31.237
That’s right, grandpa.

14:31.271 --> 14:34.007
We’ll just stay here
and‐and play checkers!

14:34.040 --> 14:35.542
Like we used to!

14:35.576 --> 14:38.378
Checkers?
Yeah, checkers is nice.

14:38.411 --> 14:40.446
Maybe later after my nap.

14:43.550 --> 14:44.651
Just say when?

14:45.619 --> 14:46.920
When.

14:48.522 --> 14:51.658
Oh, I almost forgot.

14:51.692 --> 14:53.459
You do that a lot at my age.

14:54.494 --> 14:56.329
This is for you, Larry.

14:56.362 --> 14:58.932
Copy of my will.

14:58.965 --> 15:01.001
Keep it handy. Just in case.

15:08.441 --> 15:10.644
Well, I hope you’re happy.

15:10.677 --> 15:13.046
You took the grand
out of grandpapa

15:13.079 --> 15:15.081
and you put the old
back into old man.

15:17.618 --> 15:19.419
Balki, grandpa is fine.

15:19.452 --> 15:21.555
He’s just using
the wisdom of his years

15:21.588 --> 15:23.123
and planning ahead!

15:24.224 --> 15:27.628
La‐Larry! Larry!

15:27.661 --> 15:30.363
Do you have a plastic bag
for my suit?

15:30.396 --> 15:31.632
I want to keep it clean.

15:31.665 --> 15:33.700
This is the one
I’m gonna be buried in.

15:33.734 --> 15:38.705
We... Well, grandpa,
you’re being foolish.

15:38.739 --> 15:40.741
Well, maybe you’re right.

15:40.774 --> 15:43.309
No sense wrapping
it in plastic.

15:43.343 --> 15:46.379
Maybe I’ll just put
the thing on and wait it out.

15:49.349 --> 15:52.052
No, no, no.
Grand‐Grand‐Grandpapa Appleton

15:52.085 --> 15:54.120
no...now‐now listen.
That‐that’s ridiculous.

15:54.154 --> 15:56.122
B‐by the time
you’re ready to go

15:56.156 --> 15:58.625
this suit
will be hopelessly out of style.

15:58.659 --> 16:01.595
Grandpa, when‐when I told
you to‐to act your age

16:01.628 --> 16:04.464
I didn’t mean for you
to lie down and wait to die!

16:04.497 --> 16:07.267
No, no. You were right, Larry.
I thought about what you said.

16:07.300 --> 16:09.335
An old man should act his age

16:09.369 --> 16:11.271
and I was acting
like an old fool

16:11.304 --> 16:15.175
I’d still be doing it, if we
hadn’t had that little talk.

16:15.208 --> 16:17.277
Uh, listen,
Grandpapa Buzz, come on now.

16:17.310 --> 16:20.413
You, you, you just act
as young as you feel!

16:20.446 --> 16:23.483
Okay, I feel a 106.

16:23.517 --> 16:25.151
Now, can I lie down?

16:30.456 --> 16:32.492
Balki.

16:32.526 --> 16:35.629
Wh‐what have I done?
This is awful!

16:35.662 --> 16:38.331
You gotta help me get
grandpa back to his old self.

16:38.364 --> 16:40.567
Okay. I know just
what grandpapa needs.

16:40.601 --> 16:43.403
He needs to drink
from the cup of vitality.

16:43.436 --> 16:45.739
He needs to eat
from the fruit bowl of life.

16:45.772 --> 16:48.241
He needs to floss
with the string of hope.

16:49.710 --> 16:50.744
How do we do that?

16:50.777 --> 16:52.546
Simple.
We take him to George’s.

16:52.579 --> 16:55.749
The food is great,
and you’re gonna love the band.

16:55.782 --> 16:59.285
Now, you have to do
exactly as I tell you.

16:59.319 --> 17:02.422
Stand on one foot
and cluck like a chicken.

17:02.455 --> 17:04.790
[imitating chicken]

17:07.359 --> 17:08.795
I don’t see how
this is gonna help grandpa.

17:08.829 --> 17:11.064
It isn’t.
I just like seeing you do it.

17:15.335 --> 17:17.069
[instrumental music]

17:25.444 --> 17:26.847
Well, are you sure
this is gonna work?

17:26.880 --> 17:30.083
Cousin, I’m sure.
Just trust me.

17:30.116 --> 17:32.218
Sorry, it took me so long.

17:32.252 --> 17:34.821
That curb
was a lot higher than it looked.

17:38.592 --> 17:39.593
George!

17:41.127 --> 17:42.796
Geia sou, Balki!

17:43.830 --> 17:46.232
Opa!

17:46.266 --> 17:48.134
[speaking in foreign language]

17:48.168 --> 17:49.235
[speaking in foreign language]

17:49.269 --> 17:50.671
‐Cousin Larry.
‐Ah!

17:54.274 --> 17:57.277
‐Opa! Opa! Opa! Opa!
‐George! George! George!

17:57.310 --> 17:58.444
Okay. Okay.

17:58.478 --> 17:59.646
[speaking in foreign language]

17:59.680 --> 18:02.482
‐ Pappous Buzz.
‐ Pappous Buzz.

18:07.754 --> 18:09.255
George, George.

18:09.289 --> 18:10.456
[speaking in foreign language]

18:13.493 --> 18:16.129
Balki,
is this a Myposian restaurant?

18:16.162 --> 18:18.632
Well, of course not.
Don’t be ridiculous.

18:18.665 --> 18:20.366
It’s a Greek restaurant.

18:20.400 --> 18:21.602
If it were
a Myposian restaurant

18:21.635 --> 18:23.236
there’d be a pig check girl.

18:24.437 --> 18:26.507
[speaking in foreign language]

18:28.575 --> 18:30.376
Opa!

18:33.714 --> 18:34.815
Oh, you’re so cute!

18:38.384 --> 18:41.287
Athena! Athena!
Let me go, babe.

18:43.690 --> 18:44.858
George!

18:44.891 --> 18:47.628
[speaking in foreign language]

18:50.831 --> 18:53.266
[speaking in foreign language]

18:54.601 --> 18:55.636
‐Calamara.
‐Opa!

18:55.669 --> 18:56.837
Pita bread.

18:56.870 --> 18:58.271
[speaking in foreign language]

19:02.609 --> 19:05.912
Okay, George, George.
Okay, okay. Bye‐bye, babe.

19:08.782 --> 19:11.451
Oh, hey, grandpa,
isn’t this place fun?

19:11.484 --> 19:13.520
Huh? Don’t you feel alive?

19:14.655 --> 19:16.289
Don’t you feel a draft?

19:19.292 --> 19:20.661
Grandpapa, why don’t
you try some of this?

19:20.694 --> 19:22.462
It will make
your taste buds dance!

19:22.495 --> 19:24.430
Oh, no, thanks, Balki.

19:24.464 --> 19:26.833
I don’t want to risk
staining my‐my burial suit.

19:28.902 --> 19:31.304
Here, here...come on, grandpa.
Come on! We’ll both try ’em!

19:31.337 --> 19:33.674
It looks delicious. Huh?

19:33.707 --> 19:36.376
It’ll, it’ll be
a‐a new experience!

19:36.409 --> 19:38.779
He‐here. Mm. Mm‐mm.

19:44.818 --> 19:48.288
Balki, are you trying
to burn a hole in his stomach?

19:48.321 --> 19:50.390
A man his age
can’t eat that stuff!

19:50.423 --> 19:52.993
A man my age
can’t eat that stuff!

19:53.026 --> 19:56.362
Not too bad!
Sure clears the sinuses.

19:59.933 --> 20:02.335
[guitar music]

20:08.542 --> 20:10.777
Balki, I‐I think we need
to switch tables.

20:10.811 --> 20:13.279
The‐the‐the music
is too much for grandpa.

20:13.313 --> 20:15.481
‐No, cousin.
‐Grandpa, I think, I think we...

20:17.651 --> 20:19.620
[chokes]

20:22.022 --> 20:24.390
Oh, you’re so pretty!

20:32.065 --> 20:33.934
[speaking in foreign language]

20:33.967 --> 20:36.269
‐Come on, grandpa!
‐Oh, no, no.

20:36.302 --> 20:38.471
Come on, grandpa!

20:38.505 --> 20:41.542
’Let’s face
the music and dance!’

20:41.575 --> 20:43.910
Balki, I‐I‐I, I don’t think
we should do this.

20:43.944 --> 20:47.681
The floor is very slippery.
We don’t know these people!

20:54.888 --> 20:57.591
Grandpapa, look!
What a surprise! It’s Sofia!

20:57.624 --> 20:58.992
Nice to meet you.

20:59.025 --> 21:02.362
Oh, you too young
to be grandpa!

21:02.395 --> 21:05.398
I just call you Buzz.

21:14.675 --> 21:17.611
Balki,
what is the matter with you?

21:17.644 --> 21:19.012
Are you out of your mind?

21:19.045 --> 21:21.782
Spicy food, loud music, dancing?

21:21.815 --> 21:23.383
He could have a heart attack!

21:23.416 --> 21:24.651
Now, I don’t want to be known

21:24.685 --> 21:26.887
as the one in the family
who killed grandpa!

21:26.920 --> 21:28.655
Well, cousin,
you’re halfway there!

21:28.689 --> 21:30.624
You’re the one
who got him in his burial suit!

21:32.058 --> 21:33.627
Opa!

21:34.828 --> 21:35.929
Now you see?

21:35.962 --> 21:37.598
That’s how accidents happen.

21:37.631 --> 21:38.965
Opa!

21:41.101 --> 21:42.936
Oh, my Lord!

21:42.969 --> 21:46.339
He’s lost control
of his motor skills.

21:46.372 --> 21:47.774
Now, I’m gonna get him out
of here before he gets hurt!

21:47.808 --> 21:50.110
Oh, cousin, calm down,
would you please?

21:50.143 --> 21:52.078
Look at him!
He’s having fun!

21:53.880 --> 21:57.751
Well, I, I guess I could
let him finish the dance.

22:02.823 --> 22:05.826
I... It sure looks like
they’re having a lot of fun!

22:05.859 --> 22:07.561
Opa!

22:07.594 --> 22:10.430
Cousin, uh, Grandpapa Buzz
seems to feel young again.

22:10.463 --> 22:12.498
‐How about you?
‐Like this, Larry.

22:15.902 --> 22:17.604
Thanks, grandpa!

22:19.673 --> 22:23.844
Well, Balki,
Looks like Buzz is back.

22:23.877 --> 22:25.411
Thank you.

22:25.445 --> 22:26.813
Cousin, you could
have fun like that too!

22:26.847 --> 22:28.582
‐Oh, no, I‐‐
‐Yes, you could!

22:28.615 --> 22:29.916
Excuse me.

22:29.950 --> 22:31.552
Look, just like this. Opa!

22:33.554 --> 22:34.788
Oh! Well!

22:38.859 --> 22:40.126
