- BLAKE: Cat, I am so sorry I'm late!

08:51.932 --> 08:52.999
You probably called for me
and I wasn't here,

08:53.067 --> 08:54.067
and I apologize,

08:54.135 --> 08:55.936
but I have a lot of balls
in the air right now.

08:56.003 --> 08:56.970
But if I had been here,

08:57.038 --> 08:58.994
I would've told you not to use
the poison lipstick

08:59.029 --> 09:01.208
- because you end up kissing Glenn.
- CAT: Glenn. I...

09:01.275 --> 09:03.343
BLAKE:
Oops. That is my fault.

09:03.411 --> 09:05.212
I am sorry.
I will own that one.

Oh.

09:06.681 --> 09:07.914
How did you know all this?

09:07.982 --> 09:09.282
BLAKE:
Oh. Uh, earlier,

09:09.384 --> 09:11.018
I moved Val's wig a little bit

09:11.085 --> 09:13.286
and that set a whole series
of things in motion.

09:13.387 --> 09:15.021
I'm talking to people about it.

09:15.089 --> 09:18.291
I'm like, um, an omniscient narrator
of sorts.

09:18.358 --> 09:20.893
But, anyway,
we have to get Glenn to Sy!

09:20.961 --> 09:22.895
He's the only one with the antidote.
Come on!

09:22.963 --> 09:24.589
CAT:
Oh.

09:26.400 --> 09:29.435

Now is the perfect time to strike.

Now's the time for my thing.

09:46.286 --> 09:48.354
Val!

09:48.422 --> 09:51.491
I wanted to make a grand gesture
of sacrifice and commitment...

09:51.558 --> 09:53.459
So I surgically removed my penis.

SY: I have the antidote,
but I refuse to give it to you

10:06.971 --> 10:10.809
until Val stops trying
to overthrow me.

10:10.877 --> 10:11.910
VALERIE:
I'll only agree to that

10:11.978 --> 10:14.713
if Owen repeats exactly
what he said just a second ago.

10:14.814 --> 10:16.215
What was that again?

OWEN: Uh...Well, I was...
[ Clears throat ]

[ Audience gasps ]

10:23.823 --> 10:27.193
SY: Funny you should say that,
because love...

Glenn...
