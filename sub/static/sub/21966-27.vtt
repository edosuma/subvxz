NEWSREEL NARRATOR:

00:04.250 --> 00:07.166
Now in the News

00:04.250 --> 00:07.166
on Griffin Rock,

00:07.208 --> 00:10.375
brought to you by the makers

00:07.208 --> 00:10.375
of Luskey's Hair Tonic.

00:10.417 --> 00:13.709
A full head of hair

00:10.417 --> 00:13.709
for your full-time man.

00:13.750 --> 00:17.166
Today, a time capsule goes

00:13.750 --> 00:17.166
into the ground,

00:17.208 --> 00:19.667
filled with items

00:17.208 --> 00:19.667
representing the people

00:19.709 --> 00:21.625
of this Maine island

00:19.709 --> 00:21.625
community.

00:21.667 --> 00:23.458
Local citizens

00:21.667 --> 00:23.458
and scientists

00:23.500 --> 00:26.000
are all on hand

00:23.500 --> 00:26.000
for the ceremony.

00:26.041 --> 00:28.250
And there's

00:26.041 --> 00:28.250
Dr. Elma Hendrickson,

00:28.291 --> 00:30.291
who spearheaded the effort.

00:30.333 --> 00:34.208
This time capsule will not

00:30.333 --> 00:34.208
see the light of day again

00:34.250 --> 00:37.458
until it's reopened

00:34.250 --> 00:37.458
in 75 years.

00:37.500 --> 00:40.792
Until then, Horace Burns

00:37.500 --> 00:40.792
will stand guard,

00:40.834 --> 00:44.291
and we'll see you

00:40.834 --> 00:44.291
in the news.

00:44.333 --> 00:46.000
FRANKIE:

00:44.333 --> 00:46.000
And from the old newsreel,

00:46.041 --> 00:47.959
we'll dissolve

00:46.041 --> 00:47.959
to our video.

00:48.000 --> 00:50.917
We are so getting an A

00:48.000 --> 00:50.917
on this project.

00:50.959 --> 00:53.125
Okay, Cody. Action!

00:53.166 --> 00:55.208
Seventy-five years

00:53.166 --> 00:55.208
have come and gone.

00:55.250 --> 00:58.041
Tomorrow, Griffin Rock will dig

00:55.250 --> 00:58.041
up that time capsule, and--

00:58.083 --> 01:00.333
What's inside of it?

00:58.083 --> 01:00.333
FRANKIE: Cut!

01:00.375 --> 01:04.125
Blades, you Bots can't be seen

01:00.375 --> 01:04.125
talking on camera, remember?

01:04.166 --> 01:06.291
Oh. Right. Sorry.

01:06.333 --> 01:09.166
But I can't stand

01:06.333 --> 01:09.166
the suspense.

01:09.208 --> 01:11.208
And action.

01:11.250 --> 01:12.709
( clears throat )

01:12.750 --> 01:14.166
There is no record

01:12.750 --> 01:14.166
of what items

01:14.208 --> 01:15.625
were put into the capsule.

01:15.667 --> 01:17.375
But seeing what was meaningful

01:15.667 --> 01:17.375
back then

01:17.417 --> 01:20.333
will help us understand how much

01:17.417 --> 01:20.333
Griffin Rock has changed.

01:20.375 --> 01:23.083
Changed? Pfft. How long have

01:20.375 --> 01:23.083
we been here?

01:23.125 --> 01:26.125
And they're still not ready

01:23.125 --> 01:26.125
to accept the idea of aliens,

01:26.166 --> 01:27.583
much less embrace us.

01:27.625 --> 01:30.291
I'm ready to embrace

01:27.625 --> 01:30.291
everyone right now.

01:30.333 --> 01:32.834
Come on, hug up!

01:30.333 --> 01:32.834
Don't even.

01:32.875 --> 01:34.750
FRANKIE:

01:32.875 --> 01:34.750
Ugh. Okay, cut.

01:34.792 --> 01:36.959
Cody, maybe we should get

01:34.792 --> 01:36.959
some comments

01:37.000 --> 01:38.375
from people around town.

01:38.417 --> 01:40.083
Good idea.

01:38.417 --> 01:40.083
My Dad said he'd help.

01:40.125 --> 01:41.333
( dials phone )

01:40.125 --> 01:41.333
Hey, Dad,

01:41.375 --> 01:42.834
can we get

01:41.375 --> 01:42.834
that interview now?

01:42.875 --> 01:44.583
CHIEF:

01:42.875 --> 01:44.583
Not quite yet, son.

01:44.625 --> 01:46.875
I'm diamond shopping

01:44.625 --> 01:46.875
with Doc,

01:46.917 --> 01:48.834
direct from the factory.

01:53.083 --> 01:56.667
Doc, are there diamonds

01:53.083 --> 01:56.667
even left in this old mine?

01:56.709 --> 01:59.875
If there are, my gemstone

01:56.709 --> 01:59.875
detector will find them.

01:59.917 --> 02:01.792
Seems like choosing

01:59.917 --> 02:01.792
an engagement ring

02:01.834 --> 02:03.333
shouldn't be this hard.

02:03.375 --> 02:06.417
I want to create something

02:03.375 --> 02:06.417
special for Anna.

02:06.458 --> 02:08.333
She deserves nothing less.

02:08.375 --> 02:10.875
A question about the exchange

02:08.375 --> 02:10.875
of marriage rings.

02:10.917 --> 02:13.083
Are they perhaps symbolic

02:10.917 --> 02:13.083
of handcuffs,

02:13.125 --> 02:15.750
designed to prevent

02:13.125 --> 02:15.750
your spouse from escaping?

02:15.792 --> 02:18.041
( chuckles ):

02:15.792 --> 02:18.041
No, Chase.

02:18.083 --> 02:20.792
The rings signify a bond

02:18.083 --> 02:20.792
between two people.

02:20.834 --> 02:23.458
Marriage changes

02:20.834 --> 02:23.458
everything.

02:23.500 --> 02:25.875
It's like the ground suddenly

02:23.500 --> 02:25.875
shifting underneath your--

( both grunt )

03:20.709 --> 03:21.959
( Chase thuds )

03:22.000 --> 03:23.500
Chase, are you all right?

03:23.542 --> 03:24.834
CHASE:

03:23.542 --> 03:24.834
Yes, sir.

03:24.875 --> 03:26.333
You may release the beam,

03:26.375 --> 03:28.333
and I will catch you both.

03:28.375 --> 03:32.625
I find myself having

03:28.375 --> 03:32.625
a little trouble letting go.

03:32.667 --> 03:34.583
I don't think

03:32.667 --> 03:34.583
you'll have to.

03:34.625 --> 03:35.834
( both scream )

03:35.875 --> 03:37.083
( grunts )

03:37.125 --> 03:38.375
Whew.

03:38.417 --> 03:40.125
Thanks, partner.

03:40.166 --> 03:43.291
What do you say we end this

03:40.166 --> 03:43.291
shopping trip for the day, huh?

03:45.291 --> 03:46.917
DOC GREENE:

03:45.291 --> 03:46.917
Not yet.

03:46.959 --> 03:49.750
Looks like a blue light special.

03:55.458 --> 03:57.583
A little large

03:55.458 --> 03:57.583
for Anna's hand,

03:57.625 --> 03:59.125
but I think she'll like it.

03:59.166 --> 04:00.417
Of course she will.

04:00.458 --> 04:01.667
( device beeps )

04:01.709 --> 04:03.041
Another diamond?

04:03.083 --> 04:05.875
It appears to be a rare form

04:03.083 --> 04:05.875
of Reactaline.

04:05.917 --> 04:07.792
Is that a gemstone?

04:07.834 --> 04:09.667
Yes, basically.

04:09.709 --> 04:11.250
With a few metals thrown in.

04:12.542 --> 04:13.750
Hmm.

04:13.792 --> 04:15.208
Veins of Reactaline

04:15.250 --> 04:17.709
apparently run

04:15.250 --> 04:17.709
under the entire island.

04:17.750 --> 04:19.291
I've never even

04:17.750 --> 04:19.291
heard of it.

04:19.333 --> 04:20.625
I've only encountered

04:20.667 --> 04:22.458
one other specimen

04:20.667 --> 04:22.458
of this caliber.

04:22.500 --> 04:25.250
in an ancient statue

04:22.500 --> 04:25.250
displayed in our museum.

04:25.291 --> 04:26.917
I've always wanted

04:25.291 --> 04:26.917
to experiment on it,

04:26.959 --> 04:29.291
but it's much

04:26.959 --> 04:29.291
too valuable.

04:29.333 --> 04:30.750
Say no more, Doc.

04:30.792 --> 04:33.083
Chase, dig her up,

04:30.792 --> 04:33.083
and then get us out of here.

04:33.125 --> 04:34.583
Right away, sir.

04:34.625 --> 04:37.208
WOMAN 1:

04:34.625 --> 04:37.208
Where's Chief Burns?

04:37.250 --> 04:38.625
WOMAN 2:

04:37.250 --> 04:38.625
Where is Chief Burns?

04:38.667 --> 04:40.250
( crowd shouting indistinctly )

04:38.667 --> 04:40.250
( barks )

04:41.291 --> 04:43.000
HUXLEY:

04:41.291 --> 04:43.000
An unruly crowd.

04:43.041 --> 04:44.458
A family taking refuge.

04:44.500 --> 04:46.709
And many, many questions.

04:46.750 --> 04:49.375
I'm Huxley Prescott,

04:46.750 --> 04:49.375
and tomorrow is official

04:49.417 --> 04:52.625
Dig up an Old Time Capsule

04:49.417 --> 04:52.625
and Bury a New One Day.

04:52.667 --> 04:55.500
And people want to know

04:52.667 --> 04:55.500
what will be going inside

04:55.542 --> 04:57.417
the new capsule.

04:57.458 --> 05:01.083
And why does Chief Burns

04:57.458 --> 05:01.083
get to decide?

05:01.125 --> 05:03.166
( people shouting )

05:03.208 --> 05:05.709
WOMAN: Put this inside.

05:03.208 --> 05:05.709
MAN: Oh, chief, right here!

05:06.792 --> 05:08.417
Wonderful.

05:08.458 --> 05:11.291
Just leave your items

05:08.458 --> 05:11.291
outside, everyone.

05:11.333 --> 05:12.959
I'll review them later.

05:14.834 --> 05:16.917
How long has this craziness

05:14.834 --> 05:16.917
been going on?

05:16.959 --> 05:18.417
Hours.

05:18.458 --> 05:20.041
Frankie and I tried

05:18.458 --> 05:20.041
interviewing everyone

05:20.083 --> 05:22.250
about the old time capsule,

05:20.083 --> 05:22.250
but all they care about

05:22.291 --> 05:23.875
is what's going

05:22.291 --> 05:23.875
into the new one.

05:23.917 --> 05:25.333
CHIEF:

05:23.917 --> 05:25.333
I guess it's because

05:25.375 --> 05:26.834
people want

05:25.375 --> 05:26.834
to be remembered.

05:26.875 --> 05:29.458
What we leave behind

05:26.875 --> 05:29.458
does say a lot about us.

05:29.500 --> 05:31.417
What's everyone

05:29.500 --> 05:31.417
so excited about?

05:31.458 --> 05:34.542
There's stuff in my cab

05:31.458 --> 05:34.542
older than 75 years.

05:34.583 --> 05:37.667
That makes us all

05:34.583 --> 05:37.667
time capsules.

05:37.709 --> 05:38.917
Whoa.

05:38.959 --> 05:40.709
It'll be interesting

05:38.959 --> 05:40.709
to see

05:40.750 --> 05:43.500
what people in the past thought

05:40.750 --> 05:43.500
was important enough to bury.

05:43.542 --> 05:46.291
Probably not so different

05:43.542 --> 05:46.291
from what's important today.

05:46.333 --> 05:48.542
Things that remind them

05:46.333 --> 05:48.542
of family, friends,

05:48.583 --> 05:50.917
hope for the future.

05:50.959 --> 05:54.959
At least my family isn't

05:50.959 --> 05:54.959
caught up in all this hysteria.

05:55.041 --> 05:57.959
Exactly, Dad. Just forget

05:55.041 --> 05:57.959
about the people outside.

05:58.000 --> 06:00.834
Because my helmet really needs

05:58.000 --> 06:00.834
to go in the capsule for sure.

06:00.875 --> 06:04.500
Dad, as your only daughter,

06:00.875 --> 06:04.500
I think this should go in.

06:04.542 --> 06:06.083
( toy squeaks )

06:04.542 --> 06:06.083
So please don't say no.

06:06.125 --> 06:07.875
How about something

06:07.917 --> 06:10.166
that actually contributed

06:07.917 --> 06:10.166
to this town?

06:10.208 --> 06:11.792
Like my tablet.

06:10.208 --> 06:11.792
( all arguing )

06:15.500 --> 06:18.667
It would appear we are going

06:15.500 --> 06:18.667
to need a larger capsule.

06:18.709 --> 06:21.500
As long as there's room

06:18.709 --> 06:21.500
for this.

06:21.542 --> 06:23.166
My scoop claw.

06:23.208 --> 06:24.750
Put that away, Blades.

06:24.792 --> 06:26.709
We're not part

06:24.792 --> 06:26.709
of this community.

06:26.750 --> 06:28.458
Why would you say that,

06:26.750 --> 06:28.458
Heatwave?

06:28.500 --> 06:30.875
Because despite everything

06:28.500 --> 06:30.875
we've done for this town,

06:30.917 --> 06:33.875
they still just see us

06:30.917 --> 06:33.875
as rescue equipment.

06:33.917 --> 06:36.125
But you keep saving

06:33.917 --> 06:36.125
everyone anyway.

06:36.166 --> 06:38.583
Griffin Rock obviously

06:36.166 --> 06:38.583
means something to you guys,

06:38.625 --> 06:40.625
so that makes you

06:38.625 --> 06:40.625
a part of it.

06:40.667 --> 06:42.709
It makes us part

06:40.667 --> 06:42.709
of this family.

06:42.750 --> 06:44.166
That's all.

06:44.208 --> 06:47.291
( indistinct arguing )

06:47.333 --> 06:49.166
Sir, the crowd

06:47.333 --> 06:49.166
will not disperse.

06:49.208 --> 06:50.959
Shall I break out

06:49.208 --> 06:50.959
the riot gear?

06:51.000 --> 06:52.500
Oh, they'll leave

06:51.000 --> 06:52.500
soon enough.

06:52.542 --> 06:54.166
Storm's on its way.

06:54.208 --> 06:56.792
I hope Woodrow

06:54.208 --> 06:56.792
doesn't get caught in it.

06:56.834 --> 06:58.959
I was unaware that your brother

06:56.834 --> 06:58.959
was planning a visit.

06:59.000 --> 07:02.375
You know him. He never misses

06:59.000 --> 07:02.375
a chance to dig up something.

07:02.417 --> 07:04.333
He's coming over

07:02.417 --> 07:04.333
on his boat.

07:04.375 --> 07:08.041
I can't wait to see what he

07:04.375 --> 07:08.041
wants to put in the new capsule.

07:08.083 --> 07:09.792
Blades?

07:12.792 --> 07:14.208
( sighs ):

07:12.792 --> 07:14.208
That's not what I meant

07:14.250 --> 07:15.709
by "put it away."

07:15.750 --> 07:17.333
Fine.

07:17.375 --> 07:19.792
But then this doesn't get

07:17.375 --> 07:19.792
to go in there, either.

07:23.750 --> 07:25.875
FRANKIE:

07:23.750 --> 07:25.875
Commencing test two.

07:25.917 --> 07:28.625
Sonic bombardment

07:25.917 --> 07:28.625
of Reactaline.

07:32.417 --> 07:34.500
Intriguing.

07:34.542 --> 07:38.250
The same results as with

07:34.542 --> 07:38.250
the electricity in test one.

07:38.291 --> 07:42.375
The Reactaline is so conductive,

07:38.291 --> 07:42.375
it takes on the properties

07:42.417 --> 07:45.083
of whatever energy source

07:42.417 --> 07:45.083
it's exposed to.

07:45.125 --> 07:48.417
Though the effect

07:45.125 --> 07:48.417
does appear temporary.

07:48.458 --> 07:51.417
Then that proves

07:48.458 --> 07:51.417
your hypothesis, right, Daddy?

07:51.458 --> 07:55.041
One more test before we

07:51.458 --> 07:55.041
can confirm, my little Edison.

07:55.083 --> 07:58.583
Commencing test three:

07:55.083 --> 07:58.583
magnetizing the Reactaline.

08:02.166 --> 08:04.500
( device beeps )

08:07.208 --> 08:09.083
It appears as if it's being

08:07.208 --> 08:09.083
magnetically drawn

08:09.125 --> 08:10.959
in that direction.

08:11.000 --> 08:13.000
But not toward metal.

08:13.041 --> 08:14.917
( rumbling )

08:17.291 --> 08:19.333
Oh, dear.

08:19.375 --> 08:22.041
That direction is downtown.

08:24.792 --> 08:26.667
HEATWAVE:

08:24.792 --> 08:26.667
Rescue Bots, roll to the rescue.

08:26.709 --> 08:28.458
( sirens blare )

08:36.250 --> 08:38.959
Power up and energize.

08:41.667 --> 08:43.166
Perhaps someone

08:41.667 --> 08:43.166
should hold on to me.

08:46.041 --> 08:48.000
( all grunt )

08:51.250 --> 08:53.375
(  suspenseful theme playing  )

08:55.667 --> 08:57.709
I'm on it! Literally.

08:57.750 --> 08:59.000
Whoa!

09:00.208 --> 09:01.458
BLADES:

09:00.208 --> 09:01.458
Uh-oh.

09:09.875 --> 09:12.625
Please do not touch

09:09.875 --> 09:12.625
the displays.

09:18.792 --> 09:21.125
I wonder what Doc did

09:18.792 --> 09:21.125
to this Reactaline.

09:21.166 --> 09:22.542
FRANKIE:

09:21.166 --> 09:22.542
We just magnetized it.

09:22.583 --> 09:24.083
DOC GREENE:

09:22.583 --> 09:24.083
And that caused it

09:24.125 --> 09:25.667
to be pulled toward

09:24.125 --> 09:25.667
another object

09:25.709 --> 09:28.291
with the same properties:

09:25.709 --> 09:28.291
this statue.

09:28.333 --> 09:30.250
Like a giant

09:28.333 --> 09:30.250
super magnet.

09:30.291 --> 09:32.291
PRESIDENT ARTHUR:

09:30.291 --> 09:32.291
Thank you for visiting.

09:32.333 --> 09:34.750
Please exit

09:32.333 --> 09:34.750
through the gift shop.

09:34.792 --> 09:36.750
( thunder crashes )

09:36.792 --> 09:38.041
Storm's getting worse.

09:38.083 --> 09:40.000
I hope Uncle Woodrow's okay.

09:40.041 --> 09:42.583
(  dramatic theme playing  )

09:48.959 --> 09:50.583
( loud snoring )

09:53.834 --> 09:55.667
( snorts )

09:55.709 --> 09:58.041
Throw one more water balloon,

09:55.709 --> 09:58.041
Charlie, and I'm telling you...

09:58.083 --> 09:59.709
Huh?

10:02.250 --> 10:04.959
When did it get stormy?

10:14.083 --> 10:17.083
Mayday! This is the S.S.

10:14.083 --> 10:17.083
Close Encounter  to...

10:18.458 --> 10:19.917
( screams )

10:22.417 --> 10:24.083
( sputters and coughs )

10:28.333 --> 10:30.083
Oh!

10:39.000 --> 10:40.458
( sputtering and coughing )

10:40.500 --> 10:42.083
What...

10:42.125 --> 10:43.792
Thank you.

10:45.000 --> 10:46.250
Who...?

10:49.291 --> 10:51.417
Hello?

10:51.458 --> 10:54.041
Who just rescued me?

10:54.083 --> 10:56.917
I told you we should have

10:54.083 --> 10:56.917
just put him into a life raft.

10:56.959 --> 10:58.250
There wasn't time.

10:58.291 --> 10:59.709
Then what'll we do

10:59.750 --> 11:02.125
when he doesn't find

10:59.750 --> 11:02.125
any humans onboard?

11:02.166 --> 11:05.208
Well, considering most humans

11:02.166 --> 11:05.208
aren't the brightest points

11:05.250 --> 11:07.417
on the sextant,

11:05.250 --> 11:07.417
I'll handle it.

11:07.458 --> 11:09.375
Shh, here he comes.

11:09.417 --> 11:11.125
WOODROW:

11:09.417 --> 11:11.125
Hello?

11:11.166 --> 11:13.291
Hello?

11:13.333 --> 11:17.709
( in robotic voice ):

11:13.333 --> 11:17.709
You have been rescued by an

11:13.333 --> 11:17.709
unmanned automated vessel.

11:17.750 --> 11:19.542
Amazing!

11:19.583 --> 11:21.834
I've never heard

11:19.583 --> 11:21.834
of such a thing.

11:21.875 --> 11:23.166
Except for...

11:23.208 --> 11:25.959
Except for Autobots.

11:26.000 --> 11:28.959
Hey, you're from Cybertron,

11:26.000 --> 11:28.959
aren't you?

11:29.041 --> 11:32.041
Uh...no.

11:33.667 --> 11:35.917
What do you know

11:33.667 --> 11:35.917
about Autobots?

11:35.959 --> 11:40.500
I'm Woodrow. Brother to Chief

11:35.959 --> 11:40.500
Charlie Burns of Griffin Rock.

11:40.542 --> 11:42.583
( laughs ):

11:40.542 --> 11:42.583
I'm family.

11:44.625 --> 11:46.291
The Woodrow Burns?

11:46.333 --> 11:49.208
The one Optimus talks about.

11:46.333 --> 11:49.208
The underground expedition.

11:49.250 --> 11:51.625
Optimus and I are like this.

11:51.667 --> 11:53.375
This one's me.

11:53.417 --> 11:55.625
I'm Salvage.

11:53.417 --> 11:55.625
This is Blurr.

11:55.667 --> 11:56.917
And that's High Tide.

11:56.959 --> 11:58.875
It's him we're riding on.

11:58.917 --> 12:01.333
Well, his vessel.

12:01.375 --> 12:04.458
Good thing we came by

12:01.375 --> 12:04.458
when we did, or you'd a been--

12:04.500 --> 12:06.875
Really late

12:04.500 --> 12:06.875
to Griffin Rock.

12:06.917 --> 12:08.583
Oh, that's where

12:06.917 --> 12:08.583
we're headed.

12:08.625 --> 12:10.500
Optimus asked us to observe

12:08.625 --> 12:10.500
the time capsule ceremony

12:10.542 --> 12:12.375
as a lesson in Earth culture.

12:12.417 --> 12:14.875
( laughs ):

12:12.417 --> 12:14.875
And when Optimus "asks,"

12:14.917 --> 12:16.458
we go.

12:16.500 --> 12:18.291
( thunder crashes )

12:18.333 --> 12:20.250
Well, this storm,

12:20.291 --> 12:24.000
I just hope Charlie doesn't have

12:20.291 --> 12:24.000
to cancel the whole shebang.

12:27.333 --> 12:28.834
With a storm

12:27.333 --> 12:28.834
threatening,

12:28.875 --> 12:30.959
the unearthing

12:28.875 --> 12:30.959
of the 75-year-old time capsule

12:31.000 --> 12:32.417
is about to begin.

12:32.458 --> 12:34.208
( thunder crashes )

12:32.458 --> 12:34.208
Aah!

12:35.291 --> 12:37.166
( chuckles )

12:37.208 --> 12:40.834
Unfortunately we're a little

12:37.208 --> 12:40.834
rushed due to inclement weather.

12:40.875 --> 12:45.000
So without further ado,

12:40.875 --> 12:45.000
Rescue Robots, begin.

12:45.041 --> 12:47.166
( fanfare plays )

12:54.917 --> 12:57.333
Did you finish

12:54.917 --> 12:57.333
the ring, Daddy?

12:57.375 --> 13:01.041
I intend to pop the question

12:57.375 --> 13:01.041
as soon as the ceremony is over.

13:04.667 --> 13:06.875
( applause )

13:06.917 --> 13:12.041
And now, let's see

13:06.917 --> 13:12.041
what the townsfolk of yesteryear

13:12.083 --> 13:14.250
wanted us to learn

13:12.083 --> 13:14.250
about them.

13:14.291 --> 13:17.166
Chief, if you'd be so kind.

13:19.625 --> 13:20.959
( all gasp )

13:23.500 --> 13:25.458
Uh, wha-- What?

13:23.500 --> 13:25.458
That's it?

13:25.500 --> 13:26.709
A crystal?

13:26.750 --> 13:28.667
( townsfolk chattering angrily )

13:31.625 --> 13:33.792
Maybe this note

13:31.625 --> 13:33.792
will explain.

13:33.834 --> 13:36.166
"Dear future citizens

13:33.834 --> 13:36.166
of Griffin Rock.

13:36.208 --> 13:38.125
I'm Dr. Elma Hendrickson..."

13:38.166 --> 13:39.667
DR. HENDRICKSON:

13:38.166 --> 13:39.667
I am sorry for removing

13:39.709 --> 13:41.542
the items

13:39.709 --> 13:41.542
from the time capsule.

13:41.583 --> 13:45.458
But this quantum crystal

13:41.583 --> 13:45.458
is an important discovery,

13:45.500 --> 13:49.208
and too dangerous to fall

13:45.500 --> 13:49.208
into the wrong hands.

13:49.250 --> 13:51.458
I trust the scientists

13:49.250 --> 13:51.458
of tomorrow

13:51.500 --> 13:54.458
will be much more responsible

13:51.500 --> 13:54.458
with it.

13:54.500 --> 13:57.000
Oh, of all the...

13:57.041 --> 13:58.750
Chief Burns,

13:58.792 --> 14:01.709
let's hope the artifacts

13:58.792 --> 14:01.709
you choose for the new capsule

14:01.750 --> 14:03.917
aren't as disappointing

14:01.750 --> 14:03.917
as this!

14:03.959 --> 14:06.417
Scoop claw. Just saying.

14:06.458 --> 14:09.417
"Wrong hands?" What was she

14:06.458 --> 14:09.417
afraid of, do you think?

14:09.458 --> 14:11.959
It only took a tiny piece

14:09.458 --> 14:11.959
of a quantum crystal

14:12.000 --> 14:14.375
to power Daddy's

14:12.000 --> 14:14.375
teleportation device.

14:14.417 --> 14:15.959
Remember how that

14:14.417 --> 14:15.959
turned out?

14:16.041 --> 14:19.125
The MHQ zapping all over town,

14:16.041 --> 14:19.125
with us in it.

14:19.166 --> 14:22.458
If this crystal, that big,

14:19.166 --> 14:22.458
has the same properties,

14:22.500 --> 14:24.750
no telling

14:22.500 --> 14:24.750
what it's capable of.

14:24.792 --> 14:27.291
What--? Should we evacuate

14:24.792 --> 14:27.291
the island?

14:27.333 --> 14:28.709
No need for that yet.

14:28.750 --> 14:30.667
But I suggest

14:28.750 --> 14:30.667
clearing the area

14:30.709 --> 14:32.417
until we know

14:30.709 --> 14:32.417
what we're dealing with.

14:32.458 --> 14:34.166
Uh, go home, folks.

14:34.208 --> 14:36.333
Nothing more to see here.

14:36.375 --> 14:38.667
And just to be

14:36.375 --> 14:38.667
on the safe side,

14:38.709 --> 14:41.166
I'll be on my yacht.

14:42.542 --> 14:44.333
What does it all mean?

14:44.375 --> 14:45.792
I'm out of here.

14:45.834 --> 14:48.000
( all scream )

14:48.041 --> 14:50.834
Please, everyone,

14:48.041 --> 14:50.834
there's no need to--

14:50.875 --> 14:52.750
( sighs )

14:55.792 --> 14:58.208
Ah, the old hometown.

14:58.250 --> 14:59.458
( laugh )

14:59.500 --> 15:00.875
It'll be good to be back.

15:00.917 --> 15:03.291
Yeah. Can't say

15:00.917 --> 15:03.291
that I miss it.

15:03.333 --> 15:05.792
Though sometimes

15:03.333 --> 15:05.792
I wonder how Cody is.

15:05.834 --> 15:09.250
( thunder crashes )

15:09.291 --> 15:13.125
Well, looks like we haven't seen

15:09.291 --> 15:13.125
the worst of this storm.

15:13.166 --> 15:15.208
(  dramatic theme playing  )

15:24.250 --> 15:27.333
The waves emitted by this

15:24.250 --> 15:27.333
crystal are off the charts.

15:27.375 --> 15:28.750
Dr. Hendrickson

15:27.375 --> 15:28.750
was right.

15:28.792 --> 15:31.208
This is quite

15:28.792 --> 15:31.208
a powerful artifact.

15:34.166 --> 15:35.709
We have to get it inside.

15:35.750 --> 15:37.375
If it's struck by lightning,

15:37.417 --> 15:39.625
it could trigger

15:37.417 --> 15:39.625
a teleportation.

15:39.667 --> 15:42.041
For now, let's just put it

15:39.667 --> 15:42.041
back where we found it.

15:42.083 --> 15:43.834
Bots?

15:45.166 --> 15:47.291
Aah!

15:47.333 --> 15:48.709
( gasps )

15:48.750 --> 15:50.000
Reactaline!

15:50.041 --> 15:51.291
Oh, dear.

15:51.333 --> 15:55.375
(  dramatic theme playing  )

16:20.875 --> 16:23.250
Where did Griffin Rock go?

16:29.458 --> 16:31.458
WOMAN 1: Help!

16:29.458 --> 16:31.458
MAN 1: Help!

16:31.500 --> 16:33.000
WOMAN 1: Help! Over here!

16:31.500 --> 16:33.000
MAN 1: I can't swim! Help!

16:33.041 --> 16:34.500
WOMAN 2:

16:33.041 --> 16:34.500
Help me!

16:34.542 --> 16:36.542
Somebody rescue me!

16:36.583 --> 16:37.792
( sputters )

16:37.834 --> 16:39.500
Rescue us first!

16:39.542 --> 16:41.083
I'm the mayor!

16:41.125 --> 16:44.709
The mayor of what?

16:50.417 --> 16:52.625
I'll call Optimus.

16:52.667 --> 16:55.333
Seriously, someone wanna tell me

16:52.667 --> 16:55.333
where Griffin Rock went?

16:55.375 --> 16:56.959
We'll worry

16:55.375 --> 16:56.959
about that later.

16:57.000 --> 16:59.625
Right now,

16:57.000 --> 16:59.625
people need our help.

17:04.583 --> 17:06.667
( rumbling )

17:11.875 --> 17:13.583
Daddy!

17:13.625 --> 17:15.125
I'm here, Francine.

17:16.375 --> 17:18.208
Create a windbreak

17:16.375 --> 17:18.208
around them.

17:20.709 --> 17:22.750
DANI:

17:20.709 --> 17:22.750
Where'd this blizzard come from?

17:22.792 --> 17:24.625
More like where did we go?

17:24.667 --> 17:26.250
Magnetic North.

17:26.291 --> 17:27.917
I don't know how,

17:27.959 --> 17:30.834
but Griffin Rock has been

17:27.959 --> 17:30.834
teleported to the Arctic.

17:30.875 --> 17:33.041
The-- The properties

17:30.875 --> 17:33.041
of the quantum crystal

17:33.083 --> 17:36.500
were absorbed into the veins

17:33.083 --> 17:36.500
of Reactaline underground.

17:36.542 --> 17:39.875
Basically making the whole

17:36.542 --> 17:39.875
island a teleportation device.

17:39.917 --> 17:43.750
Okay, but can't we, like,

17:39.917 --> 17:43.750
reverse it and go home?

17:45.917 --> 17:47.583
That crystal is history.

17:47.625 --> 17:49.291
This is not acceptable.

17:49.333 --> 17:51.917
Ice makes flying

17:49.333 --> 17:51.917
almost impossible.

17:51.959 --> 17:55.709
Then again, I could learn

17:51.959 --> 17:55.709
to love it here.

17:55.750 --> 17:57.458
We need to get people

17:55.750 --> 17:57.458
off this island, fast.

17:57.500 --> 17:59.125
To where?

17:59.166 --> 18:01.834
I don't believe there is

17:59.166 --> 18:01.834
an evacuation plan in place

18:01.875 --> 18:03.625
that covers this situation.

18:03.667 --> 18:05.542
And for that, I apologize.

18:05.583 --> 18:07.166
We have to do something.

18:07.208 --> 18:09.458
Nobody can survive

18:07.208 --> 18:09.458
these temperatures for long.

18:09.500 --> 18:10.750
We could raise the dome.

18:10.792 --> 18:12.083
That would keep

18:10.792 --> 18:12.083
the blizzard out.

18:12.125 --> 18:13.917
Is there enough power

18:12.125 --> 18:13.917
for that, Doc?

18:13.959 --> 18:15.291
For a while, at least.

18:15.333 --> 18:17.542
But first the four

18:15.333 --> 18:17.542
dome generators

18:17.583 --> 18:19.917
will have to be deiced.

18:19.959 --> 18:21.291
Sounds like a plan to me.

18:21.333 --> 18:24.041
Rescue Bots,

18:21.333 --> 18:24.041
roll to the rescue.

18:24.083 --> 18:26.750

18:42.709 --> 18:44.458

18:56.000 --> 18:57.333
( all gasp )

19:07.250 --> 19:09.083
( both yelp )

19:11.417 --> 19:13.834
WOMAN:

19:11.417 --> 19:13.834
Oh! Oh, my goodness!

19:13.875 --> 19:15.333
Aah!

19:19.125 --> 19:22.041
Aah! My yacht!

19:22.083 --> 19:23.291
( groans )

19:23.333 --> 19:26.417
Oh, now I have

19:23.333 --> 19:26.417
nothing left.

19:31.208 --> 19:32.667
( pants )

19:32.709 --> 19:34.917
( barks )

19:34.959 --> 19:36.917
( wind gusting )

19:42.792 --> 19:44.166
( whines )

19:45.583 --> 19:47.375
( computers beep )

19:49.834 --> 19:51.458
DOC GREENE:

19:49.834 --> 19:51.458
The Bots made it.

19:51.500 --> 19:53.542
Let's just hope

19:51.500 --> 19:53.542
their deicing foam

19:53.583 --> 19:55.458
can free up

19:53.583 --> 19:55.458
those generators.

19:56.583 --> 19:59.625
ALL:

19:56.583 --> 19:59.625
Power up and energize!

20:01.834 --> 20:04.250
Dad, what'll we do

20:01.834 --> 20:04.250
after the dome's up?

20:04.291 --> 20:06.041
We're still stranded.

20:06.083 --> 20:07.500
We'll figure it out.

20:07.542 --> 20:10.375
One thing stays the same

20:07.542 --> 20:10.375
through every generation

20:10.417 --> 20:12.041
on Griffin Rock.

20:12.083 --> 20:13.625
We're resourceful.

20:13.667 --> 20:15.458
The generators

20:13.667 --> 20:15.458
are all ready.

20:15.500 --> 20:16.750
Fingers crossed.

20:16.792 --> 20:18.291
( computers beep )

20:19.583 --> 20:22.375
(  dramatic theme playing  )

20:39.250 --> 20:41.208
( sighs ):

20:39.250 --> 20:41.208
Finally.

20:41.250 --> 20:42.750
I thought I'd never

20:41.250 --> 20:42.750
stop shivering.

20:42.792 --> 20:44.083
Before the snow melts,

20:44.125 --> 20:46.250
shall we enjoy

20:44.125 --> 20:46.250
some winter activities?

20:46.291 --> 20:48.959
A snowball fight, perhaps?

20:49.000 --> 20:51.458
I'll take that as a yes.

20:53.250 --> 20:55.959
Ah, no telling how long

20:53.250 --> 20:55.959
this dome will stay up.

20:56.000 --> 20:58.625
( sighs ):

20:56.000 --> 20:58.625
I know this is

20:56.000 --> 20:58.625
a temporary fix,

20:58.667 --> 21:00.750
but sometimes you just

20:58.667 --> 21:00.750
gotta take a breath

21:00.792 --> 21:02.208
and enjoy what's good.

21:02.250 --> 21:04.750
( sighs ):

21:02.250 --> 21:04.750
You're right.

21:06.166 --> 21:07.834
That's long enough.

21:06.166 --> 21:07.834
Let's go.

21:07.875 --> 21:10.959
Uh, Daddy, what's that mean?

21:11.000 --> 21:14.458
It means the dome is depleting

21:11.000 --> 21:14.458
our energy supplies

21:14.500 --> 21:17.417
faster than

21:14.500 --> 21:17.417
I anticipated.

21:17.458 --> 21:19.959
And with the blizzard outside

21:17.458 --> 21:19.959
still raging,

21:20.000 --> 21:22.000
we need a Plan B.

21:22.041 --> 21:23.834
Immediately.
