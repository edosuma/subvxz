00:48.025 --> 00:48.827
Fuck!

00:53.789 --> 00:54.594
Sir?

00:54.714 --> 00:56.291
- What the fuck?
- Jesus, Eric.

00:56.521 --> 00:58.771
I thought that haji was killing you.

01:01.523 --> 01:03.773
I fucked his shit up good, didn't I?

01:05.894 --> 01:07.769
You stuck him in a magazine.

01:09.395 --> 01:11.216
Better luck next time, sir.

01:16.326 --> 01:19.619
Damn, sir. Your hamster
must have fell off its wheel.

01:32.524 --> 01:34.934
<i>All Hitman Two Victors,
this is Hitman Two.</i>

01:35.161 --> 01:39.151
<i>Continue digging in. We're holding here
while R.C.T. One advances. Over.</i>

01:49.707 --> 01:51.857
R.C.T. One is moving into Al Kut.

01:56.494 --> 01:59.211
It's about time
they carried their weight.

02:03.023 --> 02:05.173
Kocher is on patrol in this zone.

02:06.144 --> 02:08.857
Do not engage on your left
beyond eleven o'clock.

02:11.268 --> 02:13.696
<i>Copy on all, Three Two. Godfather out.</i>

02:20.034 --> 02:22.545
I'm taking him to a field interrogation.

02:27.048 --> 02:28.276
It's all good.

02:28.746 --> 02:30.152
He's your capture.

02:34.834 --> 02:37.284
Shit, he'd probably fuck up the report.

02:39.769 --> 02:43.058
<i>Mobile One One this is boom boom.
You got wind of One Five.</i>

02:44.189 --> 02:45.039
<i>Roger...</i>

03:09.161 --> 03:12.351
- {Sir, }The officers are assembled.
- Let's go right away.

03:22.254 --> 03:24.628
As of 0915 hours

03:25.633 --> 03:28.145
forward elements
of Colonel Dowdy's regiment

03:28.305 --> 03:31.606
seized the main bridge
over the Tigris river in Al Kut.

03:32.190 --> 03:35.633
As you know, I just returned
from a meeting with General Mattis.

03:35.753 --> 03:37.264
What you don't know

03:37.384 --> 03:40.797
is that shortly after Dowdy
led his regiment into Al Kut,

03:41.866 --> 03:44.119
General Mattis relieved him
of his command.

03:46.629 --> 03:47.915
And gentlemen,

03:48.182 --> 03:50.459
Colonel Dowdy was also relieved

03:50.620 --> 03:52.416
of the ammo for his sidearm.

03:56.752 --> 03:58.702
Colonel Dowdy was a good man,

03:59.805 --> 04:02.008
but he did not fully embrace

04:02.383 --> 04:03.804
maneuver warfare.

04:03.924 --> 04:05.419
And lest we forget,

04:05.857 --> 04:07.488
maneuver warfare

04:08.439 --> 04:11.089
is America's warfare
for the 21st century.

04:11.877 --> 04:14.760
It is all about the violence of action.

04:16.505 --> 04:19.117
With first recon
at the tip of the spear,

04:19.315 --> 04:21.329
7,000 Marines

04:21.575 --> 04:24.010
have just completed
the corps' longest march

04:24.130 --> 04:27.270
since the barbary campaign
against Tripoli in 1803.

04:28.751 --> 04:32.042
Actually, some of you are riding
in the same Humvees they used.

04:33.316 --> 04:35.254
Through our use of maneuver,

04:35.815 --> 04:39.452
we have tied down many times
our number of the enemy's force,

04:40.072 --> 04:41.388
opening the door

04:41.858 --> 04:44.903
for the army to invade
the enemy capital from the west.

04:45.023 --> 04:47.694
Sir, does this mean
it's the end of our mission?

04:47.814 --> 04:48.664
Unknown.

04:49.378 --> 04:50.240
But

04:50.807 --> 04:53.572
the First Marine Division
is positioning itself

04:53.692 --> 04:57.132
on the outskirts of Baghdad
for the assault, and we will be there.

04:57.252 --> 04:58.446
Rest assured,

04:58.906 --> 05:01.822
Godfather will find a mission
for this battalion.

05:03.252 --> 05:05.742
But what I want to leave you with today
is this:

05:07.130 --> 05:09.580
Colonel Dowdy did succeed this morning.

05:11.005 --> 05:13.132
He did lead his men into Al Kut.

05:15.754 --> 05:16.950
But General Mattis

05:18.415 --> 05:19.849
has a long memory.

05:22.378 --> 05:23.707
He did not forget

05:24.498 --> 05:26.177
that at critical moments

05:27.035 --> 05:29.185
Dowdy hesitated to execute orders.

05:31.239 --> 05:32.459
And gentlemen,

05:34.202 --> 05:35.229
Ferrando

05:36.805 --> 05:38.576
has a long memory too.

05:52.689 --> 05:53.695
Gunny,

05:54.796 --> 05:56.460
that stuff about the General's memory

05:56.871 --> 05:58.710
and Dowdy being relieved,

05:59.877 --> 06:02.327
was Godfather talking about us in there?

06:03.628 --> 06:07.400
I believe he meant, sir,
that if you don't square away Nate Fick,

06:08.351 --> 06:09.966
you'll be in his sights.

06:17.159 --> 06:18.164
Gunny,

06:18.416 --> 06:20.132
the men get those new M.R.Es?

06:20.252 --> 06:21.961
They did. They're happy.

06:22.327 --> 06:24.136
These are the new ones with milkshakes.

06:24.256 --> 06:26.779
There's strawberry,
chocolate and vanilla.

06:27.790 --> 06:31.140
Didn't you get Hasser's report
on shooting that civilian?

06:32.100 --> 06:34.858
We've got to take care
of this asscovering bullshit.

06:34.978 --> 06:36.875
It'll be good for Hasser too.

06:37.306 --> 06:39.170
He does his duty,
gets back to being a Marine.

06:39.290 --> 06:41.574
Thanks, Mike. You're a fucking nag.

06:44.414 --> 06:45.364
Hey, Walt.

06:45.932 --> 06:47.191
Feel the love.

06:51.224 --> 06:52.140
Walt,

06:52.301 --> 06:55.303
- baby.
- Just leave me the fuck alone.

06:57.105 --> 06:58.818
Finally, he speaks.

07:04.546 --> 07:07.060
I liked it better when we were starving.

07:07.704 --> 07:10.065
Then I didn't have
to see shit all over your face.

07:10.185 --> 07:11.238
Want some?

07:15.054 --> 07:15.903
Walt.

07:18.883 --> 07:21.294
Finish your report
and get it to me ASAP.

07:21.414 --> 07:22.964
You did nothing wrong.

07:23.331 --> 07:26.356
But we're gonna see if there's
a better way to stop these cars.

07:26.476 --> 07:28.326
Walt's got a great way, Lt.

07:29.159 --> 07:30.221
Shoot the driver,

07:30.381 --> 07:31.597
stop the car.

07:34.925 --> 07:36.052
Trombley.

07:44.603 --> 07:45.853
Sir, it's vital.

07:47.352 --> 07:49.425
Hasser will write his way clear,

07:49.991 --> 07:52.243
but we're fast becoming
an army of occupation.

07:53.473 --> 07:55.547
We can't just shoot these civilians
like we're doing.

07:55.667 --> 07:58.847
Marines aren't cops, Brad.
We're an aggressive force.

08:00.323 --> 08:02.728
That said, we'll see what we can do.

08:03.200 --> 08:04.672
Hey, fuck it, Walt.

08:04.832 --> 08:07.358
These haji motherfuckers
are trying to kill us.

08:07.478 --> 08:10.176
I'm for lighting up every motherfucker
that comes within 100 m.

08:13.498 --> 08:14.597
Damn, man.

08:14.758 --> 08:16.724
Didn't we kick their asses already?

08:20.865 --> 08:22.397
This is really interesting{, Brad}.

08:23.630 --> 08:26.860
You know, Iraqis don't really seem good
at fighting,

08:27.417 --> 08:30.667
but then they never really
completely surrender either.

08:33.226 --> 08:36.476
Put down that fucking milkshake
and dig a fucking hole.

08:37.077 --> 08:39.289
Why, so I can be more
like the teacher's pet?

08:40.292 --> 08:41.942
Yeah, that's exactly it.

08:42.100 --> 08:44.711
- You should be more like Trombley.
- More like Trombley?

08:46.043 --> 08:47.797
More like Trombley?!

08:49.929 --> 08:51.844
- Whopper Jr.
- Give me the hook.

08:52.004 --> 08:53.357
Whopper Jr.

09:06.091 --> 09:06.941
Walt.

09:10.511 --> 09:12.719
Anybody find that extra pin
from the gypsy rack?

09:12.839 --> 09:14.115
No, we still missing that?

09:14.276 --> 09:18.170
That thing's gonna fucking fall off
and we're gonna lose all our water cans.

09:18.290 --> 09:20.163
Maybe take an extra off
and shove those down.

09:32.053 --> 09:34.303
Brunmeier, drink the fucking water.

09:34.430 --> 09:36.444
- How are they doing?
- Ass to mouth disease.

09:36.732 --> 09:38.558
Half the guys got the shits.

09:38.678 --> 09:41.013
- Both right now?
- Yeah, take 'em.

09:41.953 --> 09:44.017
It's a good thing this is over.

09:44.370 --> 09:45.170
Fuck!

09:45.290 --> 09:46.591
For us, anyway.

09:46.711 --> 09:49.185
Manimal just dropped a case of grenades.

09:49.305 --> 09:51.683
See?
That's why we can't have nice things.

09:51.803 --> 09:52.953
Fucking hick.

09:53.116 --> 09:56.190
- You wanted to see me, sir?
- Nate, did you hear?

09:56.846 --> 09:59.296
General Mattis shitcanned Colonel Dowdy.

09:59.902 --> 10:01.954
He took the ammo from his sidearm,
lieutenant.

10:05.116 --> 10:07.066
Colonel wasn't a team player.

10:07.432 --> 10:10.282
Godfather said
we should all play on the team.

10:10.618 --> 10:13.071
If it can happen to a full bird Colonel,

10:13.434 --> 10:15.156
it can happen to anyone.

10:18.215 --> 10:20.973
{Nate, }So you know, there will be
no more questioning of my orders.

10:23.222 --> 10:25.565
Respectfully, sir, I've only tried
to interpret your intent

10:25.685 --> 10:27.439
to the best of my ability.

10:30.687 --> 10:31.707
Captain, sir.

10:32.163 --> 10:34.060
Here comes the warrior on our team.

10:34.180 --> 10:36.823
Outstanding work last night
taking down that E.P.W.

10:37.241 --> 10:40.698
- Just doing my job.
- Looks like he put up quite a fight.

10:41.161 --> 10:44.163
A fight like that tells me
the company took in a highvalue asset.

10:44.423 --> 10:45.957
He did not want to surrender.

10:46.245 --> 10:47.667
You have the afteraction report?

10:48.182 --> 10:50.232
Sergeant Kocher is bringing it.

10:50.729 --> 10:53.756
While your platoon has been busy
shooting civilians at roadblocks

10:53.917 --> 10:55.883
Bravo Three
was taking in live prisoners.

10:56.044 --> 10:57.005
I heard.

10:57.495 --> 10:58.745
Good work, Dave.

11:03.127 --> 11:04.976
{Man, I'm hungry. }Anybody got any chow over there?

11:05.137 --> 11:06.186
{Yeah, I got some. }What do you want?

11:07.556 --> 11:09.605
I'll take anything I can get
at this point.

11:09.766 --> 11:12.874
Tell Victor Three to get on the road,
we got C.A.O. checks.

11:14.311 --> 11:17.113
This'll be handy if we write
your platoon up for a commendation.

11:18.386 --> 11:19.373
Sergeant,

11:19.493 --> 11:21.743
your E.P.W. put up quite a struggle.

11:21.953 --> 11:23.703
It's a good thing your C.O. was there.

11:26.052 --> 11:28.584
If you want to believe
what was the reason for this meeting?

11:29.503 --> 11:30.503
Right.

11:31.807 --> 11:33.713
Battalion says we're moving on.

11:34.018 --> 11:35.687
That's ASAP, Lieutenant.

11:40.770 --> 11:43.660
- Lieutenant, I was about to...
- Yeah, but no.

11:44.217 --> 11:45.765
Not the right time.

12:06.031 --> 12:07.039
Trombley,

12:07.868 --> 12:09.874
why were they calling you Whopper Jr.?

12:10.413 --> 12:12.202
They were calling me that?

12:17.297 --> 12:18.229
Ray...

12:19.230 --> 12:21.280
Why were they calling him that?

12:24.994 --> 12:27.875
- Brad, we got foot mobiles.
- Hitman Two, this is Two One.

12:27.995 --> 12:30.979
We've got a bunch of foot mobiles
at 11 o'clock.

12:32.309 --> 12:34.145
<i>Interrogative: do they have weapons?</i>

12:34.265 --> 12:36.777
<i>- Hostile intent?
- They got naked intent.</i>

12:38.265 --> 12:39.394
Be advised,

12:39.514 --> 12:41.964
there's a minivan pulling off the road.

12:42.506 --> 12:43.266
<i>Roger.</i>

12:43.386 --> 12:45.869
<i>- Be vigilant, over.
- Trombley, range the Mark-19.</i>

12:46.521 --> 12:48.491
Bad guys could be in that van.

12:48.919 --> 12:50.164
Stand by, Hitman Two.

12:50.867 --> 12:52.342
<i>Roger, standing by.</i>

12:55.288 --> 12:56.797
Walt, watch your fucking sector.

13:00.729 --> 13:02.577
{Man, }It looks like we caught
these guys in the act,

13:02.697 --> 13:04.976
trying to change their uniforms.

13:05.096 --> 13:07.254
Two Actual,
we ought to halt the convoy here.

13:07.374 --> 13:08.909
<i>Roger that, Two One.</i>

13:15.320 --> 13:17.089
They say they were robbed.

13:18.038 --> 13:19.555
Lying motherfuckers.

13:20.670 --> 13:22.530
Tell us where you hid your uniforms.

13:23.318 --> 13:24.568
Your documents.

13:28.238 --> 13:30.164
They say there were robbed
by the soldiers.

13:30.284 --> 13:32.582
They stole their clothes
and siphoned the gas from the car.

13:33.814 --> 13:35.435
Lieutenant Fick, sir!

13:35.812 --> 13:36.840
Over here!

13:44.337 --> 13:45.951
{Hey, }Be careful of the one on the right!

13:46.071 --> 13:48.994
He's got a horse cock like Manimal's.
You don't want to get that thing angry.

13:49.114 --> 13:51.159
Sir, we have three Arab males

13:51.929 --> 13:52.836
naked.

13:52.956 --> 13:55.143
It appears they've been shot
execution style.

13:55.263 --> 13:57.923
H.M.C. Bryan investigating
the cause of death has determined

13:58.043 --> 13:59.343
all three have been killed

13:59.463 --> 14:01.555
with gunshot wounds
to the back of the head.

14:01.675 --> 14:03.013
Good work, Rudy.

14:03.133 --> 14:06.764
- Team Two at your service, sir.
- Team leader of the year, Rudy Reyes.

14:06.884 --> 14:08.159
This ain't our work.

14:09.070 --> 14:10.828
Dudes are telling the truth.

14:12.345 --> 14:15.166
He says they are farmers.
One family brothers.

14:15.328 --> 14:17.078
I don't think he's lying.

14:17.349 --> 14:19.292
<i>Command Two, this is Two One Bravo.</i>

14:19.412 --> 14:21.238
I've got an{ motherfucking} english speaking haji

14:21.358 --> 14:23.446
in this minivan
waving around his wife beater.

14:23.566 --> 14:26.344
Says they got jacked
by some Iraqi soldiers.

14:29.517 --> 14:32.319
Americans, you win battle,
beat Saddam's army.

14:32.439 --> 14:34.741
Now his army beat us. What you do?

14:38.106 --> 14:39.090
They rob us.

14:39.210 --> 14:40.533
What do you do?

14:42.408 --> 14:43.408
Listen,

14:43.528 --> 14:45.852
this is something
you're gonna have to...

14:45.972 --> 14:47.921
You have to take it up with the U.N.

14:48.041 --> 14:48.957
Okay?

14:49.077 --> 14:50.243
Just

14:50.403 --> 14:51.755
stay back from the road.

14:51.875 --> 14:54.413
And you don't have to wave
your T-shirts around anymore, all right?

14:59.240 --> 15:00.163
Here.

15:03.293 --> 15:04.766
Found a haji helmet.

15:06.036 --> 15:06.969
Fits good.

15:07.889 --> 15:09.068
How do I look?

15:10.243 --> 15:11.410
Like a target.

15:15.560 --> 15:17.377
It's better than nothing.

15:22.238 --> 15:25.486
What we did,
running and gunning through those towns,

15:25.606 --> 15:28.072
the good stuff and the bad
was all part of the plan.

15:32.260 --> 15:35.246
Of all the Marines in the 1st division,
the General selected us

15:35.724 --> 15:38.205
to be the instrument
of long range strategy.

15:38.325 --> 15:39.908
We led the feint to Al Kut.

15:40.028 --> 15:41.676
We tied down two Iraqi divisions,

15:41.796 --> 15:44.347
saved untold numbers of U.S. soldiers.

15:46.147 --> 15:47.621
You should be proud.

15:48.161 --> 15:49.967
Why didn't we go into Al Kut?

15:50.087 --> 15:52.471
Gabe, the General's plan
wasn't about taking the city.

15:52.845 --> 15:56.143
It was about making the Iraqis think
we were gonna take it.

15:56.920 --> 15:57.988
To be clear,

15:58.421 --> 16:00.637
the Commander's intent
was never to take it.

16:00.757 --> 16:02.231
The focus has always been Baghdad.

16:02.945 --> 16:04.192
This sucks, man.

16:04.448 --> 16:06.532
We did all this shit
because we took a wrong turn?

16:06.652 --> 16:09.587
- Gabe, that's not what I'm saying.
- {What, }You got something better to do?

16:09.707 --> 16:11.694
What the fuck is in your hand?

16:12.789 --> 16:14.076
It's my new helmet, sir.

16:17.510 --> 16:19.937
It's a haji gear I painted Marine camo.

16:20.513 --> 16:23.002
I lost my kevlar in the run
to the airfield, remember?

16:23.217 --> 16:26.214
Sergeant Major Sixta
made me ditch the bike helmet.

16:29.070 --> 16:29.984
Brad?

16:30.551 --> 16:32.935
How's your teams combat effectiveness?

16:33.055 --> 16:34.890
Well, we got Person's allergies,

16:35.010 --> 16:37.224
but none of my teams got the shits.

16:37.701 --> 16:39.472
Leon and Lilley both have it, but

16:39.592 --> 16:41.580
they're still doing their job, sir.

16:41.700 --> 16:43.000
Team Two is out.

16:43.260 --> 16:44.915
Three is almost as bad.

16:46.342 --> 16:50.207
Looks like we'll be nursing
this platoon all the way into Baghdad.

16:50.327 --> 16:52.407
My money is we won't be
in the assault to Baghdad.

16:54.451 --> 16:56.495
You don't use Humvees
to attack an urban center.

16:57.950 --> 17:00.707
You don't use Humvees to strong point
a city either, but we did.

17:01.299 --> 17:02.819
Maybe they'll hook us up, sir,

17:02.939 --> 17:05.726
let us guard some of Saddam's money
in one of those palaces.

17:05.846 --> 17:06.837
I don't know.

17:08.641 --> 17:12.472
I just hope we get to fuck up
some more shit before the war ends.

17:12.930 --> 17:15.454
They need to send our asses to Baghdad.

17:32.399 --> 17:34.335
Reyes, how many guys
are sick on your team?

17:34.455 --> 17:36.236
I have three men down, warrior healer.

17:36.356 --> 17:38.355
That makes 14 in the platoon.

17:39.006 --> 17:40.453
Are you throwing up?

17:40.723 --> 17:42.173
Wake up, Budweiser.

17:42.371 --> 17:44.721
Brunmeier, come on. Wake the fuck up.

17:46.075 --> 17:47.363
I got the shits, doc.

17:47.483 --> 17:49.707
- I can't.
- Drink some water, you fucking asshole.

17:49.827 --> 17:52.253
What's this about a T72 tank
on his side of the perimeter?

17:52.373 --> 17:54.594
- It's fucking blown, Gunny.
- Reyes.

17:55.395 --> 17:56.992
Aye, Gunnery Sergeant.

17:58.725 --> 18:00.195
What kind of {pisspoor }team leader are you,

18:00.315 --> 18:02.653
not checking out an enemy tank
on your perimeter?

18:02.773 --> 18:03.924
Roger that, Gunny.

18:04.044 --> 18:06.439
Being I'm the only man on my team
not down with the shits

18:06.734 --> 18:08.148
I will take out a patrol.

18:08.268 --> 18:11.209
No, you put the hammer to your team.
Like Godfather says,

18:11.329 --> 18:14.614
malingering spreads like a yeast
infection unless you nip it in the bud.

18:15.409 --> 18:16.782
These men can't walk.

18:17.013 --> 18:18.961
Has our Lieutenant approved this order?

18:19.081 --> 18:19.828
He has.

18:21.052 --> 18:23.372
If the men are ill,
then you should go with them, corpsman.

18:26.363 --> 18:27.419
I love this guy.

18:29.223 --> 18:31.344
And you'd better watch it, doc.

18:32.790 --> 18:34.594
Team Three will take it.

18:34.880 --> 18:36.369
Your men are sicker.

19:09.967 --> 19:11.326
Doesn't even have a turret.

19:11.446 --> 19:13.640
Fucking cocksucker sends us
into a fucking swamp

19:13.760 --> 19:15.705
to check this weak shit out.

19:17.889 --> 19:19.554
What the hell was that?

19:23.333 --> 19:24.618
I shit my pants.

19:26.849 --> 19:30.075
How are you showing yourself
as team leader tonight?

19:30.810 --> 19:31.697
Tonight?

19:32.891 --> 19:33.767
Rudy.

19:33.956 --> 19:35.924
- Yes, sir.
- Where the hell is Lovell's team?

19:36.044 --> 19:37.394
They're out there.

19:38.019 --> 19:40.934
- They're inspecting the T72.
- A tank? Where?

19:41.612 --> 19:42.829
In the swamp.

19:43.114 --> 19:44.704
They blown out one.

19:45.114 --> 19:47.024
Gunnery Sergeant Griego
informed us that you...

19:47.144 --> 19:49.375
They're covering your ass, Nate.

19:53.331 --> 19:55.418
What the fuck is going on here?

19:55.707 --> 19:57.801
How would it look if that tank
was operational?

19:58.266 --> 20:00.592
I'll tell you what it looks like
right now.

20:00.712 --> 20:03.192
It resembles an incompetent moron
climbing up the asshole

20:03.312 --> 20:06.662
of his company commander
by inventing a bullshit mission.

20:07.000 --> 20:09.494
Did you seek my authority
before tasking my platoon with this?

20:09.614 --> 20:10.414
I did.

20:10.702 --> 20:13.150
I woke you 40 mikes ago
to affirm the order.

20:13.270 --> 20:14.276
You woke me?

20:15.494 --> 20:17.188
I hadn't been to sleep in 36 hours.

20:17.308 --> 20:19.989
I have no recollection whatsoever
of you waking me.

20:25.790 --> 20:27.163
I thought I was dreaming.

20:34.674 --> 20:36.424
Get the fuck out of here.

20:37.390 --> 20:40.040
And do not ever again
mess with my platoon.

20:47.376 --> 20:49.426
I was just trying to cover you.

20:51.414 --> 20:53.605
You know you're suspect with battalion.

20:55.821 --> 20:56.771
Fuck that.

20:58.156 --> 20:59.988
You can fuck with me
all you want but do not,

21:00.148 --> 21:02.824
I repeat, do not fuck with my men.

21:06.192 --> 21:08.042
I'm putting it down, Gunny.

21:09.461 --> 21:10.811
You picking it up?

21:35.198 --> 21:38.108
Stiney, that's my front yard
you just puked on there.

21:38.594 --> 21:39.394
Sorry.

21:56.758 --> 21:58.708
Clumps of them in 10s and 20s.

22:00.573 --> 22:02.954
They're coming from as far as I can see.

22:14.693 --> 22:16.683
Quite a party you got going, Damon.

22:16.803 --> 22:19.153
They started showing up at 00 dark 30.

22:24.765 --> 22:27.203
The plan is for my platoon
to escort these folks through our lines

22:27.323 --> 22:28.869
to the southern checkpoint.

22:28.989 --> 22:31.739
Need you to let them through
in blocks of 40.

22:32.057 --> 22:34.992
Sir, if I may ask,
why not send them back to Al Kut?

22:35.841 --> 22:38.296
- The fighting's over there.
- These people aren't from Al Kut.

22:38.416 --> 22:40.366
They say they're from Baghdad.

22:43.414 --> 22:44.759
They walked over 100 miles?

22:46.162 --> 22:46.962
Look,

22:47.206 --> 22:48.535
we don't know who anyone is.

22:48.655 --> 22:51.705
Could be a suicide bomber among us,
so stay frosty.

22:52.496 --> 22:54.030
Keep your vehicles at a walking pace

22:54.150 --> 22:56.424
and this is important keep
a good distance from these people.

22:56.544 --> 22:57.571
Roger.

23:05.527 --> 23:08.977
White boys on my team
celebrating the end of our war, sir.

23:12.998 --> 23:14.265
35, 40 at a clip.

23:14.768 --> 23:16.218
Keep the families together.

23:16.338 --> 23:17.463
Roger.

23:17.583 --> 23:20.628
Smith, bring them through
in groups of 35.

23:20.788 --> 23:22.473
Keep the families together.

23:22.593 --> 23:23.795
Slow walk them.

23:24.101 --> 23:25.051
Stay hard.

23:26.050 --> 23:27.790
Slow walk them. Slow walking them.

23:27.910 --> 23:29.345
<i>This is Hitman Actual.</i>

23:29.505 --> 23:31.514
<i>Keep your eyes open. Watch their hands.</i>

23:31.744 --> 23:33.210
<i>Some of them might be armed.</i>

23:33.641 --> 23:35.042
Kid, nice jacket.

23:38.869 --> 23:39.719
Espera.

23:39.869 --> 23:40.712
Espera!

23:40.832 --> 23:42.082
Take this group.

23:42.935 --> 23:45.218
<i>- Salâmu 'alaykum.
- Salâmu 'alaykum.</i>

23:45.338 --> 23:46.588
<i>Salâmu 'alaykum.</i>

23:48.857 --> 23:51.207
Keep your fucking distance from them.

23:51.951 --> 23:53.823
Lilley, why don't you take up the rear?

23:53.943 --> 23:56.093
Garza, come up here to the front.

23:56.751 --> 23:57.746
All right?

23:57.866 --> 23:59.751
<i>- Let's roll.
- Bravo, this is Two Two.</i>

24:00.389 --> 24:03.893
<i>Don't point {your }weapons at these people,
but keep your guns up.</i>

24:11.945 --> 24:15.053
<i>Hitman Two Three, {	his is }Hitman Two Two.
Roger, copy that.</i>

24:15.173 --> 24:17.268
<i>All right, we've got
the left side on this one.</i>

24:30.202 --> 24:32.714
<i>Two Two, keep an eye on that group
coming past your Humvee.</i>

24:32.834 --> 24:34.284
Where's my Trombley?

24:37.434 --> 24:39.284
Get these people some water.

24:40.226 --> 24:42.001
Not the ass water. Get the bottled.

24:46.376 --> 24:49.065
<i>Two Two, keep that group tight.
Keep a good pace.</i>

24:51.003 --> 24:52.853
Carry that, miss? I got it.

24:59.437 --> 25:01.187
Yo, break out some M.R.Es.

25:02.907 --> 25:05.692
Like my nigga Tupac said,
"it's hard times, man. "

25:05.852 --> 25:06.652
Yeah.

25:06.824 --> 25:08.374
Make me wanna holler.

25:08.563 --> 25:09.363
Word.

25:10.095 --> 25:11.030
What are these?

25:11.190 --> 25:12.380
- Sure.
- Water! Water!

25:12.500 --> 25:13.850
Pass them around.

25:13.970 --> 25:16.119
- Water!
- Water water, me me!

25:23.607 --> 25:24.700
Keep moving.

25:24.820 --> 25:26.170
Easy, easy, easy.

25:27.071 --> 25:28.542
Thank you, soldier.

25:29.000 --> 25:31.718
Thank you for letting me pass
on my own road in my own country.

25:32.099 --> 25:34.470
- Excuse me, ma'am?
- Why are you Americans here?

25:34.630 --> 25:36.222
We want to help you, ma'am.

25:36.382 --> 25:37.804
You know, I come from Baghdad.

25:37.924 --> 25:40.052
It is a beautiful city
and you are bombing it.

25:40.172 --> 25:41.674
This is to make my life better?

25:41.794 --> 25:43.842
{God damn it. }Brad, we don't have
to take this kind of guff.

25:43.962 --> 25:46.102
I mean, we're liberating
these ungrateful bitches.

25:46.222 --> 25:48.454
You know,
this is a very beautiful country.

25:48.574 --> 25:50.278
And our president is very stupid.

25:50.583 --> 25:52.934
Maybe you are here for liberation,
I don't know.

25:53.054 --> 25:55.866
But because of oil,
it feels like war of aggression.

25:56.027 --> 25:57.939
Ma'am, I think you got
a really good point.

25:58.059 --> 25:59.309
No, I really do.

26:00.705 --> 26:01.555
Really.

26:03.600 --> 26:05.697
So much for death before dishonor.

26:05.817 --> 26:08.379
Damn, devil dog,
for a piece of ass like that,

26:09.197 --> 26:11.460
I'd sell your sister to Uday and Qusay.

26:11.580 --> 26:13.217
<i>Hitman Two Three, this is Hitman Two.</i>

26:13.377 --> 26:14.498
Go on. Go.

26:21.332 --> 26:22.977
Don't give that thing to me.

26:24.639 --> 26:27.094
Yeah, I understand. Ma'am, I understand.

26:39.184 --> 26:40.234
Here you go.

26:43.715 --> 26:45.065
Are you happy now?

26:45.576 --> 26:47.913
Man, like this I grow up.

26:53.393 --> 26:54.243
Come on.

26:57.844 --> 26:58.894
Here you go.

27:01.504 --> 27:02.684
Mikey, give us a hand.

27:04.691 --> 27:06.141
It's okay. Come on.

27:09.698 --> 27:10.525
I got you.

27:10.685 --> 27:11.738
Here we go.

27:12.498 --> 27:13.861
Easy, easy, easy.

27:16.259 --> 27:18.032
- In you go.
- That's enough.

27:21.922 --> 27:23.713
No more. Truck's full.

27:25.242 --> 27:26.492
All right, now.

27:27.472 --> 27:29.683
We just turned this combat team
into a hay ride.

27:29.803 --> 27:30.716
Thanks.

27:30.836 --> 27:31.878
Obrigado.

27:41.717 --> 27:43.311
Got to keep them cool.

27:46.031 --> 27:49.105
Doesn't matter what we do here.
Quarter of these babies are gonna die.

27:56.230 --> 27:57.459
You all right, Nathan?

27:57.579 --> 27:58.871
Yah, Gunny.

27:59.267 --> 28:00.217
I'm good.

28:01.641 --> 28:03.191
We're helping people.

28:08.667 --> 28:10.317
This humanitarian stuff,

28:11.121 --> 28:13.883
we get lost in it,
we're not combat effective.

28:14.750 --> 28:16.400
This is our future here.

28:16.739 --> 28:17.925
Lieutenant, sir!

28:18.045 --> 28:21.913
Godfather's on the radio for you.
Battalion wants us Oscar Mike.

28:29.950 --> 28:31.700
Yeah, man. On it, thanks.

28:36.145 --> 28:38.112
Don't bravo it. Use the smoke first.

28:46.322 --> 28:47.497
What the fuck? Shit!

28:47.657 --> 28:49.355
His fucking head exploded!

28:50.034 --> 28:51.637
Guarantee he ain't getting up.

28:51.757 --> 28:54.587
At least we gave him a happy meal
before he died. No wait, check that.

28:54.747 --> 28:57.829
Before we hit him in the head
with a fucking 40 Mike-Mike.

29:10.667 --> 29:11.667
God damn!

29:12.698 --> 29:15.161
How'd the fuck the hajis kill an M1A1?

29:15.281 --> 29:16.670
Not a mobility kill.

29:16.918 --> 29:18.378
Both tracks look okay.

29:18.543 --> 29:20.112
Think the Marines in there got out?

29:20.570 --> 29:22.796
If not,
they died fighting a legit enemy.

29:22.916 --> 29:25.159
Jesus, dude. That was first marines.

29:26.893 --> 29:28.853
They've got to be from oceanside.

29:30.543 --> 29:32.437
<i>Hitman Two One, this is Hitman Two.</i>

29:32.557 --> 29:34.752
<i>The E.C.P. from the division camp
is in Grid</i>

29:35.190 --> 29:38.490
<i>Papa Quebec 278394.</i>

29:38.610 --> 29:39.549
<i>Over.</i>

29:39.826 --> 29:40.626
Roger,

29:40.746 --> 29:42.468
I copy. Grid Papa Quebec

29:42.628 --> 29:44.679
278394, over.

29:46.921 --> 29:48.214
<i>Hitman Two out.</i>

29:49.132 --> 29:51.561
Hey, those are dogs we ought to shoot.

29:51.721 --> 29:54.827
If I felt we could spare the ammo,
I'd give you the order.

29:55.469 --> 29:56.650
Oh, fuck, man.

30:00.523 --> 30:02.184
Do not run that over, Ray.

30:08.606 --> 30:09.497
Jesus.

30:09.826 --> 30:11.529
You just can't fucking win.

30:18.226 --> 30:19.026
Man,

30:19.386 --> 30:21.094
they're prepping Baghdad hard.

30:21.214 --> 30:23.171
And we're in a fucking pog camp.

30:24.070 --> 30:25.219
It's over for us.

30:26.236 --> 30:28.517
We won't be part of the show in Baghdad.

30:30.287 --> 30:31.069
Yup.

30:34.437 --> 30:36.512
This wasn't what we trained for.

30:39.971 --> 30:41.571
I just wanted to get one

30:41.691 --> 30:44.052
real recon mission in this war.

30:45.443 --> 30:46.466
You know?

30:48.511 --> 30:49.985
Putting us in these

30:50.404 --> 30:52.524
is an affront to my warrior spirit.

30:54.540 --> 30:55.701
I'm a hunter,

30:57.475 --> 31:00.538
not a fucking truck driver
corralling gun platforms.

31:03.899 --> 31:06.088
Brad, we were the fucking first boots
on the ground

31:06.208 --> 31:08.495
in the American invasion
of Mesopotamia.

31:10.425 --> 31:12.530
And you got your men out alive.

31:15.267 --> 31:18.573
Might be sad about not getting
your mission but for me,

31:20.613 --> 31:22.972
I got to tell you,
I'm glad this is over.

31:26.720 --> 31:27.966
One other thing,

31:28.086 --> 31:29.654
no more cat holes.

31:31.713 --> 31:35.618
This fucking pog camp
we're in has a legit slittrench latrine.

31:36.889 --> 31:37.776
Really.

31:42.210 --> 31:44.085
That's my recon mission then.

31:47.642 --> 31:49.493
<i>? Two on comms.</i>

31:50.948 --> 31:52.080
<i>...Hitman.</i>

31:52.200 --> 31:54.879
<i>Hitman Two Three,
this is Hitman Two Two...</i>

31:57.788 --> 31:58.660
Over.

31:59.849 --> 32:03.359
<i>Manimal, you're no longer allowed
to touch the handset again. Over.</i>

32:05.520 --> 32:06.965
I put my babies down.

32:08.220 --> 32:10.385
Think I'm gonna get some shuteye.

32:12.762 --> 32:15.154
I want you to know
you've done good, Tony.

32:18.362 --> 32:22.302
You earned a lot of reputation
in the recon community as my A.T.L.

32:25.839 --> 32:27.653
You've always had my six.

32:32.252 --> 32:34.961
I just want you to know
I really appreciate that.

32:39.202 --> 32:40.479
And it's been...

32:40.947 --> 32:42.148
Do you realize

32:43.202 --> 32:45.010
the shit that we've done here,

32:46.073 --> 32:47.650
the people we've killed?

32:49.370 --> 32:50.948
Back in the civilian world, dawg,

32:52.076 --> 32:53.415
if we did this,

32:54.668 --> 32:56.147
we would go to prison.

33:03.943 --> 33:05.755
Poke,
you're thinking like a mexican again.

33:07.165 --> 33:08.701
Think like a white man.

33:09.864 --> 33:11.302
Over there, they'll be

33:11.462 --> 33:13.583
laying on the medals for what we did.

33:21.229 --> 33:22.793
What's with you, dawg?

33:24.471 --> 33:25.777
I'm tweaking, bro.

33:27.113 --> 33:29.233
Don't feel right unless I'm strapped.

33:30.081 --> 33:31.655
I'm gonna go pull guard duty.

33:49.249 --> 33:50.049
Sir.

33:54.280 --> 33:55.308
Sergeant,

33:55.754 --> 33:58.909
they're speaking pretty highly
of First Recon at division headquarters.

33:59.718 --> 34:02.055
The General thinks
we're slaying dragons.

34:02.932 --> 34:04.466
I'm pleased to hear that, sir.

34:04.586 --> 34:06.148
But between you and me,

34:06.562 --> 34:07.693
it's bullshit.

34:08.916 --> 34:10.685
You men need another mission.

34:15.109 --> 34:17.498
Tanks are gonna lead the way
into Baghdad,

34:18.580 --> 34:20.454
but we want to get in the game too.

34:21.982 --> 34:22.958
Yes, sir.

34:24.241 --> 34:25.417
Be advised, Brad:

34:27.150 --> 34:28.221
stay frosty.

34:52.353 --> 34:54.735
- I got her right in front of me!
- Show me those titties!

34:54.855 --> 34:57.616
Come on, baby! I got 15 large!
{Just }Give me one ass cheek!

34:59.696 --> 35:01.711
- {It's }A liberated bitch.
- I'm gonna hit that shit.

35:01.831 --> 35:04.064
{You must be }Wearing your desert goggles.
That ain't nothing but a

35:04.184 --> 35:05.876
piece of nappy haired Whiskey Tango.

35:05.996 --> 35:08.862
He's right, man. You ain't hittin' shit.
W.M. like that?

35:09.080 --> 35:13.028
No, she be wearing kevlar panties nailed
on top of a concertina wire bush.

35:13.148 --> 35:15.410
Yeah, well, I'm gonna do a recon there.

35:15.916 --> 35:17.928
I'm gonna make a path
for all you motherfuckers.

35:20.424 --> 35:22.892
Shit, man, can you imagine
the stank on that cunt?

35:23.116 --> 35:25.428
That is exactly why I'm going!

35:26.180 --> 35:27.938
Sir, I'm gonna go down on her

35:28.098 --> 35:30.566
like she got all of Saddam's W.M.Ds

35:30.726 --> 35:32.755
just buried right between her legs.

35:32.932 --> 35:35.112
- You better dig deep.
- Oh, Yeah, baby!

35:35.666 --> 35:36.989
Hit that gas, come on!

35:37.149 --> 35:39.200
Give it a little tap! Pat it, pat it!

35:41.828 --> 35:44.192
It's not that bad over here.
Don't kill yourself like that.

35:44.312 --> 35:46.779
Shit, go get it, baby.
Get some for old J.C.

35:47.191 --> 35:49.627
- Oh, shit. Heads up.
- Oh, shit, smash!

35:51.101 --> 35:52.755
Belays that, Devil Dog!

35:53.217 --> 35:54.472
You's a squealin'

35:54.667 --> 35:57.773
like a bunch of butt-fucked
Vassar bitches!

35:59.403 --> 36:00.655
Unfuck yourselves

36:01.366 --> 36:03.515
or we gonna suffer the spectacle
of a W.M.

36:03.925 --> 36:06.737
with a bunch of horny Devil Dogs
trailin' their stern.

36:07.436 --> 36:09.287
Get yourselves squared up here.

36:10.670 --> 36:11.670
Corporal,

36:12.671 --> 36:16.612
you're inappropriatin' your
chemical filtration device by attemptin'

36:16.948 --> 36:18.353
fornication wit' it!

36:18.597 --> 36:22.327
Jesus, do I have to tell you not
to desecrate your mask with perversions?

36:23.753 --> 36:25.650
Where the fuck are your helmets?

36:25.987 --> 36:27.335
Fuckin' Sixta.

36:28.024 --> 36:30.159
No sooner do we stop getting shot at,

36:30.317 --> 36:32.148
the motherfucker is out here lifing us

36:32.268 --> 36:34.792
in his illiterate fucking retardese.

36:35.786 --> 36:39.152
People think they have the authority
to kill the minority, man.

36:40.325 --> 36:41.558
Fuck the police.

36:42.772 --> 36:44.592
- Holy shit!
- What the fuck?

36:46.627 --> 36:48.178
What the fuck? Get some!

36:50.014 --> 36:51.125
Fuckin' Brad.

36:55.037 --> 36:57.039
Yeah! Hell, yeah.

36:57.440 --> 36:59.380
It don't get no better than that.

37:01.107 --> 37:03.905
<i>Man over all stations, be advised:
Sergeant Colbert is...</i>

37:04.025 --> 37:05.322
<i>wings level.</i>

37:05.874 --> 37:07.162
<i>Can somebody clear him hot?</i>

37:11.884 --> 37:15.197
<i>What, did you give him some
Rolling Stone drugs or something?</i>

37:15.317 --> 37:16.119
No.

37:16.723 --> 37:18.494
What the fuck did you do to him?

37:19.316 --> 37:21.260
{Just }Asked him what he would be
if he wasn't { }Marine.

37:21.698 --> 37:24.219
Oh my god, he wants to be a ballerina?

37:24.339 --> 37:25.848
That's my fuckin' dream.

37:30.689 --> 37:31.805
What the fuck?

37:37.478 --> 37:38.733
You fucking rock.

37:42.652 --> 37:43.708
Better now.

37:46.750 --> 37:48.782
Ray, I want you to gather the team.

37:55.324 --> 37:56.253
All right.

38:00.485 --> 38:02.064
Drop your pots, gents.

38:02.801 --> 38:04.921
Sergeant Colbert's giving you a pass.

38:11.935 --> 38:14.455
There's something
I've been keeping from you.

38:15.962 --> 38:18.861
I wasn't sure we were gonna live
to share this moment.

38:21.167 --> 38:22.167
Fuck yeah!

38:26.867 --> 38:29.333
- Chef Boyardee, the master!
- To celebrate.

38:30.300 --> 38:32.581
- Here, hurry up!
- Trombley, get a fire going.

38:32.741 --> 38:33.741
Walt, here.

38:35.088 --> 38:36.960
You deceiving, conniving,

38:37.342 --> 38:39.213
hebrew motherfucker.

38:40.122 --> 38:43.357
How were you gonna keep
this from your dearest pal Rayray?

38:44.134 --> 38:45.968
I got one more secret to share.

38:51.164 --> 38:53.685
<i>- Juggs!
- No no! Wait! Not yet.</i>

38:53.846 --> 38:55.880
I need some I need some time
with this alone.

38:56.000 --> 38:57.966
- Come on. Just give me one.
- Just calm down.

38:58.086 --> 39:00.401
You'll get your sloppy
seconds with Jasmine.

39:01.387 --> 39:02.819
You gotta share with Trombley.

39:02.980 --> 39:04.581
What? He'll kill her!

39:04.701 --> 39:06.914
Eat, fuck, kill all the same, right?

39:07.034 --> 39:09.493
Yeah! All the same
if you're a fucking psycho.

39:10.905 --> 39:13.789
- I'm telling you, I fear for Jasmine.
- Speaking of which,

39:14.669 --> 39:17.584
one of you guys
still has my girlfriend's picture.

39:18.306 --> 39:19.052
Dude,

39:20.000 --> 39:23.205
I hate to tell you this, but your
girlfriend's is a kind of a whore.

39:23.325 --> 39:24.158
What?

39:24.278 --> 39:27.363
Yeah, last time I saw her,
she was doing all of H&S company.

39:27.483 --> 39:29.053
She doesn't deserve you, man.

39:30.119 --> 39:33.018
Brah, civilian food
gives me the munchies!

39:33.385 --> 39:35.135
- Lilley.
- Thanks, Brad.

39:37.889 --> 39:39.139
Arbe are faroni?

39:40.252 --> 39:41.532
What's your problem?

39:41.652 --> 39:43.844
Last time the white man gave
my people something,

39:43.964 --> 39:46.196
it was blankets laced with typhoid.

39:46.599 --> 39:48.353
Poke, can't we all just...

39:48.997 --> 39:49.947
get along?

39:52.705 --> 39:53.912
Whopper Jr.,

39:54.266 --> 39:55.913
you got any tabasco to go with this?

39:56.225 --> 39:57.646
Okay, there it is.

39:57.950 --> 39:59.951
You did just call him Whopper Jr.

40:00.071 --> 40:02.121
Now what the hell is that about?

40:03.890 --> 40:06.758
We call our man Whopper Jr.
because they're sold at Burger King.

40:08.434 --> 40:09.534
Burger King.

40:09.654 --> 40:10.721
Right. B.K.

40:11.443 --> 40:12.641
"Baby killer. "

40:12.961 --> 40:15.934
Trombley's our little Whopper Jr.
ever since he shot those shepherds.

40:19.133 --> 40:21.481
Damn, Brad,
what else you got hidden in the Humvee?

40:21.642 --> 40:22.692
A fat chick?

40:24.436 --> 40:25.873
Shoot some civilians,

40:25.993 --> 40:27.843
you get a reputation. Right?

40:32.070 --> 40:33.070
Walt.

40:34.988 --> 40:36.385
He didn't mean that.

40:42.580 --> 40:43.447
Walt.

40:43.985 --> 40:47.361
You're a fuckin' messed up hick.
You can't even eat ravioli.

40:47.481 --> 40:48.967
I'm eating ravioli.

40:51.591 --> 40:52.641
Look at him!

40:54.604 --> 40:58.334
Gents, the final battle against
Saddam's military began this morning

40:58.925 --> 41:01.166
when R.C.T-5 crossed the Diyala river.

41:01.599 --> 41:03.357
The final assault of Baghdad
is under way.

41:05.026 --> 41:06.042
Now,

41:06.499 --> 41:08.712
some of you may have surmised

41:08.832 --> 41:11.998
that this is not a game
for marines in open Humvees,

41:12.235 --> 41:14.270
that while this great battle
is being fought,

41:14.390 --> 41:17.265
you'd be sitting in a field
holding your dicks.

41:17.857 --> 41:19.790
Or if you're in h&s company,
holding our dicks.

41:23.181 --> 41:26.922
This is a problem that's been
gnawing at Godfather since Al Kut.

41:28.586 --> 41:30.801
And the solution was right
in front of me the whole time.

41:34.513 --> 41:35.514
Gentlemen,

41:35.634 --> 41:37.281
the northern flank.

41:39.079 --> 41:40.776
Above Baghdad, we assume

41:40.896 --> 41:43.295
a significant Republican guard presence,

41:44.258 --> 41:47.651
especially since it's this region that's
the home to the Sunnis and Ba'athists.

41:48.639 --> 41:51.328
Now it turns out this had been weighing
on the C.G.'s mind

41:51.448 --> 41:53.901
when I went to meet with him last night.

41:54.777 --> 41:58.776
Chaos has committed all three regiments
to the assault from the east here.

42:00.606 --> 42:03.071
There's a town called Baqubah

42:03.535 --> 42:05.377
about 50 kliks north of the city

42:06.552 --> 42:08.964
where an iraqi mechanized
Republican guard division

42:09.353 --> 42:10.893
is unaccounted for.

42:11.505 --> 42:14.355
Okay? Now this leaves
Chaos's northern flank

42:14.475 --> 42:16.548
as tender as the virgin's thigh.

42:18.747 --> 42:20.105
Until I met with him,

42:20.225 --> 42:24.224
the C.G. thought his only option was
to peel off a mechanized battalion.

42:24.773 --> 42:26.426
As a good officer should,

42:26.546 --> 42:28.296
I gave him another option.

42:29.344 --> 42:31.521
Gentlemen, we are going to Baqubah.

42:32.422 --> 42:34.692
Expect morning orders within 30 mikes.

42:35.518 --> 42:37.268
Sir, there's a situation.

42:38.269 --> 42:41.005
Despite our best efforts,
they came up on our comms this morning.

42:41.125 --> 42:45.124
They know where we are and they're less
than two kliks from our perimeter.

42:47.971 --> 42:49.981
Sir, we could give them
a tangential mission,

42:50.101 --> 42:52.251
maybe task them with guarding H&S?

42:52.501 --> 42:54.551
Major, we can't unfuck this one.

42:55.828 --> 42:57.678
Gentlemen, one other thing:

42:59.076 --> 43:01.141
Delta company will be with us.

43:04.370 --> 43:05.729
The reservists have arrived.

43:07.934 --> 43:09.484
All right, that's it.

43:24.485 --> 43:26.234
Lt, what's the date today?

43:26.354 --> 43:28.835
Copy that, Two Two. Solid copy.

43:33.900 --> 43:35.081
Yo, Dirty,

43:36.536 --> 43:38.008
you got a donkey dick?

43:38.128 --> 43:39.146
Radiator?

43:39.492 --> 43:41.242
Yeah, wait a minute, Ray.

43:43.163 --> 43:44.767
What the fuck are you doing?

43:45.314 --> 43:46.864
Writing in my journal.

43:47.415 --> 43:48.865
About all this shit?

43:49.266 --> 43:52.105
What, about you're
singlehandedly winning this war?

43:52.728 --> 43:55.234
That's the type of shit
that Cody puts in his little diary.

43:55.354 --> 43:57.192
Look, if they say
we fought valiantly here,

43:57.312 --> 43:59.326
I want 'em to know we fought retarded.

43:59.446 --> 44:01.669
Yeah, 'cause going into towns,

44:01.789 --> 44:04.079
storming an airfield
with no observation.

44:04.240 --> 44:06.785
{Come on, Ray}. I work for Captain America.
You got fick at least.

44:06.905 --> 44:09.709
I've been telling you, Eric,
it don't have to be that way.

44:10.189 --> 44:12.713
One bullet in the head,
our whole platoon is squared away.

44:12.874 --> 44:14.367
Just stow that fuckin' shit.

44:14.487 --> 44:18.008
You had your chances like everybody else
and you haven't done it, so fuck you{, man}.

44:22.969 --> 44:24.352
Here comes dumbass.

44:25.130 --> 44:27.041
Well, guys, it's been groovy.

44:28.130 --> 44:29.187
Good work, men.

44:31.124 --> 44:32.367
Yes, sir.

44:34.870 --> 44:35.600
Good.

44:36.688 --> 44:37.745
Good work.

44:48.705 --> 44:51.322
Each man sees things
differently in combat.

44:52.653 --> 44:54.296
Right now at any time, we could die.

44:55.233 --> 44:57.299
It's almost enough
to make you lose your sanity.

44:57.714 --> 45:00.135
To remain calm and stay in a place
where you think you will die,

45:00.296 --> 45:02.646
that too is the definition of insane.

45:08.084 --> 45:10.134
Nate, you have to become insane

45:10.555 --> 45:12.105
to survive in combat.

45:18.605 --> 45:19.523
Yeah.

45:23.160 --> 45:25.210
This is how it comes down to us.

45:26.191 --> 45:27.913
We're on point for the battalion,

45:28.794 --> 45:31.123
but first we're linking up with war pig.

45:31.284 --> 45:33.873
We're gonna be rolling
with some real ass the fuckin' L.A.Vs.

45:33.993 --> 45:35.252
And good newsbad news,{ Ray}.

45:35.414 --> 45:38.757
They're giving us the L.A.Vs {ut that's }because
they're sending us north of Baghdad,

45:39.665 --> 45:41.384
where all Saddam's people are from.

45:42.230 --> 45:45.012
And they don't love us up there
like they do down south.

45:45.173 --> 45:46.997
- So fuck 'em where they live.
- Damn right.

45:47.117 --> 45:49.815
We'll be surrounded by friendlies
until here...

45:49.935 --> 45:51.185
the magic line.

45:52.481 --> 45:54.814
No american unit
has gone past this line.

45:55.738 --> 45:58.388
A couple tried yesterday
and got ambushed.

45:59.400 --> 46:00.350
This...

46:01.063 --> 46:02.474
is badguy country.

46:07.050 --> 46:09.226
All I right, gents, we got 30 mikes.

46:10.454 --> 46:11.832
Somebody's got to win this.

46:12.261 --> 46:14.611
What the fuck are you all moto about?

46:15.427 --> 46:17.002
Jumpin' jehoshaphat.

46:18.188 --> 46:21.208
Are we that desperate for cannon fodder
that they're clearing out the sick,

46:21.328 --> 46:24.624
- the lame, the crazy?
- Look at you boys?

46:24.744 --> 46:26.555
At what's up with these guys?

46:26.715 --> 46:28.889
- What's up, Dawg?
- Look at these guys.

46:31.433 --> 46:34.437
- How the fuck did you find us?
- I came up

46:34.598 --> 46:35.648
with Delta.

46:36.337 --> 46:37.943
Shit, the fuckin' reservists, dude?

46:38.063 --> 46:41.938
Brad, you're not gonna believe it.
It has been madness since day one.

46:42.058 --> 46:44.446
What happened to your
cushy liaison gig at Al Jabar?

46:44.792 --> 46:47.619
Yeah, rockin' the fucking side pipe
with them air force hotties.

46:47.739 --> 46:50.299
Fuck that, I ain't had a war
since Somalia I had to get some.

46:50.419 --> 46:54.239
But I seriously would not have jumped
ship if it meant rolling with Delta.

46:54.598 --> 46:55.592
{- I understand him. - }What?

46:55.712 --> 46:57.711
- Clusterfuck?
- They're off the hook.

46:57.997 --> 47:00.435
Dude, they don't got any gear or food.

47:00.555 --> 47:02.813
They were pulling escort duty
just to eat.

47:02.933 --> 47:06.417
And then they got to rollin'
into these hamlets and doing these shows

47:06.537 --> 47:10.234
of force you know, cowboy shit for fun.
Like this one time, I swear to god,

47:10.354 --> 47:13.184
they thought it'd be funny to give
these little kids, like, porn mags

47:13.640 --> 47:16.646
<i>like Hustler and Maxim and shit,</i>

47:16.807 --> 47:18.675
show the little hajis
what we're fighting for.

47:18.795 --> 47:21.622
This old Iraqi comes storming out,

47:21.742 --> 47:24.779
starts screaming at our interpreter
about how we're fucking up their morals

47:25.283 --> 47:26.798
or some dumb shit, right?

47:26.918 --> 47:29.834
And he's super fucking pissed.
The old man's got an R.P.G.

47:30.173 --> 47:31.244
What?

47:31.404 --> 47:34.789
Delta fuckin' freaks.
They lob like 26 mark-19 rounds.

47:35.115 --> 47:36.474
They fuck up the whole hamlet.

47:36.683 --> 47:38.443
- Fuck.
- Bull-fucking-shit.

47:38.563 --> 47:40.377
Ollie North filmed
the whole fucking thing.

47:40.497 --> 47:41.779
{- What?}The Oliver North?

47:41.899 --> 47:45.717
Oliver fuckin' North was standing there
with a camera crew from Fox

47:46.084 --> 47:49.087
filming the whole {uckin' }thing like it was
the turning point in the fucking war.

47:49.207 --> 47:51.623
These delta fucks are like L.A.P.D. cops

47:51.743 --> 47:54.965
and D.E.A. agents
and fucking air marshals.

47:55.085 --> 47:56.394
You know what I mean?

47:56.554 --> 48:00.481
And they're led by this Napoleon douche
who is like a Corporal

48:00.642 --> 48:04.069
or some shit in Albuquerque P.D.
I swear to god,

48:04.229 --> 48:07.280
this motherfucker has got cattle horns

48:07.440 --> 48:10.074
- on his Humvee.
- This is so colossally retarded,

48:10.194 --> 48:13.203
- I can't even say anything about it.
- Godfather knows.

48:13.630 --> 48:17.201
He's been ducking us on the comms
for the past couple weeks.

48:17.321 --> 48:18.708
But they're here now, brad,

48:19.311 --> 48:21.333
and they're rolling with you.

48:22.330 --> 48:24.923
No fuckin' way.
We're working with reservists?

48:25.333 --> 48:26.961
That's some bullshit.

48:29.440 --> 48:31.303
Look at this motherfucker.

48:33.612 --> 48:36.167
Check it out. If I'm lying, I'm dying.

48:38.063 --> 48:40.005
That's a real marine.

48:42.218 --> 48:43.234
Fick!

48:48.727 --> 48:50.382
We're out of our M.O.P.P.S.

48:50.835 --> 48:52.648
- Right now.
- Yes, sir.

48:53.633 --> 48:55.671
You can actually see it
rolling downhill.

48:55.791 --> 48:56.611
Yep,

48:56.731 --> 48:57.914
here it comes.

48:58.476 --> 48:59.783
Change in S.O.P.

49:00.201 --> 49:03.545
Out of our M.O.P.P. suits. You've 5 min
to get right, then we're red-con one.

49:04.740 --> 49:07.506
- We're back in cammies!
- So fresh and so clean.

49:10.128 --> 49:11.870
Fuck, I don't have bootpants.

49:12.556 --> 49:14.785
My balls smell like Jack's mouth.

49:15.488 --> 49:17.475
How do you know
what his mouth smells like?

49:17.635 --> 49:19.510
'cause my balls were in it.

49:19.630 --> 49:22.063
What the fuck do they do
over there, man?

49:22.854 --> 49:25.735
No, really, if we're not
in our M.O.P.P. suits,

49:25.855 --> 49:28.291
that means there's no W.M.Ds

49:28.639 --> 49:32.637
If there's no W.M.D.S,
then why are we here in the first place?

49:33.026 --> 49:35.319
I knew you were a fucking
gay-ass liberal.

49:35.439 --> 49:38.267
You tried to pretend
by invading iraq with us, but I knew.

49:38.387 --> 49:41.733
I'm serious, Ray. Isn't that
the whole point of us being here?

49:42.255 --> 49:45.367
The point is we get to
kill people, you dumb fuck.

49:46.877 --> 49:48.860
What's the difference anyway, man?

49:48.980 --> 49:49.909
I mean,

49:50.293 --> 49:51.818
the war's almost over.

49:51.938 --> 49:54.366
We're just about done with this bitch.

49:57.667 --> 49:59.751
Shit, man, they're taking everything.

50:00.747 --> 50:01.686
Yeah,

50:02.023 --> 50:03.839
they're pretty much liberated
around here.

50:03.959 --> 50:05.590
Ray, stay focused.

50:06.372 --> 50:09.043
- We have a mission.
- Yeah, some mission...

50:09.163 --> 50:11.129
"cross the magic line. "

50:11.732 --> 50:14.042
What the fuck can that be all about?

50:16.486 --> 50:19.047
That's us. War pig, then recon.

50:19.859 --> 50:21.768
The line is on 34 northern.

50:22.242 --> 50:24.273
On the other side? The Iraqis.

50:25.358 --> 50:27.048
And they're mechanized.

50:28.553 --> 50:29.622
Focus, Ray.

50:30.525 --> 50:31.338
Focus.

50:46.808 --> 50:48.254
Watch for mines, Ray.

50:48.374 --> 50:50.588
Remember, this is bad-guy country.

50:52.622 --> 50:55.073
Reporter, do you know
what you're supposed to do

50:55.193 --> 50:59.192
if the Humvee gets hit by a mine?
You're supposed to curl up like a bitch.

50:59.362 --> 51:02.647
- Trombley, make nice.
- You know how to curl up like a bitch,

51:02.767 --> 51:04.217
don't you, reporter?

51:04.760 --> 51:08.321
<i>What is believed to bethe final assault
on the city's defenders.</i>

51:09.310 --> 51:10.925
<i>And now for cricket...</i>

51:11.874 --> 51:14.599
BBC says they're puttin' whoop-ass
on Baghdad.

51:14.719 --> 51:16.728
And we're out here
in the fucking sticks.

51:19.963 --> 51:21.732
Man, turn that shit off.

51:22.172 --> 51:26.153
<i>...disappointing results, "but,"
he said, "there's always a next time. "</i>

51:27.244 --> 51:30.306
We're out here under the radar
where nobody knows we're here.

51:31.128 --> 51:32.124
Hopefully,

51:32.809 --> 51:34.696
it'll fuckin' stay that way.

51:40.961 --> 51:43.325
Once more into the great good night.

51:44.512 --> 51:45.544
"Cry havoc

51:46.255 --> 51:48.209
"and let slip the dogs of war. "

51:48.369 --> 51:49.398
Man,

51:49.518 --> 51:53.498
when I get home, I am gonna eat
the fuck out of my girlfriend's pussy.

51:53.785 --> 51:55.235
Is that Shakespeare?

51:55.911 --> 51:57.645
Shakespeare wrote that?

51:58.116 --> 52:00.137
About his girlfriend's pussy?

52:01.424 --> 52:03.064
Godfather, Godfather.

52:05.762 --> 52:09.189
I take it the L.A.Vs in front of us
just crossedthe magic line.

52:09.349 --> 52:12.800
The L.A.Vs report enemy contact
on both sides of the road.

52:12.920 --> 52:14.611
Rockets, mortars and machine guns.

52:19.160 --> 52:23.158
Hitman, Hitman, small arms fire
to our three o'clock, 2-5-0 meters out.

52:26.549 --> 52:27.749
I have no targets.

52:29.397 --> 52:30.562
No targets.

52:34.999 --> 52:36.466
Walt, what are you shooting at?

52:36.626 --> 52:38.551
I got muzzle flashes behind those walls.

52:42.375 --> 52:44.891
Hold on, buddy!
That's a fuckin'village over there.

52:45.051 --> 52:47.852
- I see fuckin' fire coming in.
- Not from the houses!

52:48.479 --> 52:50.121
There are people in that village{, Walt}.

52:50.241 --> 52:52.590
<i>- All Hitman Two...
- They ain't shooting at us.</i>

52:52.710 --> 52:55.260
<i>...one-six north on route green. Break.</i>

52:56.222 --> 52:58.863
<i>They've made contact
with a squad-sized force. Over.</i>

52:58.983 --> 52:59.926
Roger.

53:00.367 --> 53:01.942
- {Ray, }Halt the vehicle.
- All right.

53:02.062 --> 53:03.398
L.A.Vs have stopped.

53:11.131 --> 53:13.235
<i>Enemy! Enemy, both sides! Break!</i>

53:13.964 --> 53:16.256
My God. Is he crying?

53:16.416 --> 53:17.799
No, he's not.

53:17.959 --> 53:19.067
He's just nervous.

53:19.187 --> 53:21.346
<i>We're gonna die
if they don't get us out of here!</i>

53:21.466 --> 53:23.012
<i>They sent us to die!</i>

53:23.172 --> 53:24.471
Okay, fuck it. He's crying.

53:25.419 --> 53:27.310
All Hitman Victors, this is Hitman Two.

53:27.430 --> 53:30.780
Be advised, the L.A.Vs are egressing
to the south. Break.

53:32.612 --> 53:35.262
<i>We{'re} pull{ing} back into a defensive position
and dropping mortars. Over.</i>

53:35.382 --> 53:36.471
{Yeah, }That's a solid copy.

53:36.591 --> 53:38.978
Trombley, the L.A.Vs
will be coming up on our left.

53:39.098 --> 53:40.248
Do not engage.

53:41.012 --> 53:43.027
If you do, they'll schwack us.

53:48.325 --> 53:49.569
Jesus Christ.

53:49.819 --> 53:51.123
Tracers skipping around us.

53:51.670 --> 53:54.149
That's our own guys,
shooting down the axis of our convoy.

53:54.269 --> 53:55.995
<i>All Hitman Two Victors,
hold your fire...</i>

53:56.115 --> 53:57.643
Fucking reservists.

53:57.763 --> 53:58.881
<i>Hold, Delta. Over.</i>

54:00.927 --> 54:03.577
Is that the reservists firing
on the ville?

54:03.982 --> 54:05.832
- Walt!
- It's Delta.

54:06.434 --> 54:08.370
They're laying down F.P.F.
on the village.

54:08.490 --> 54:11.172
- It's all fucked up.
- Get those guys on the net.

54:11.292 --> 54:14.542
Man, they got passed down.
We have no comms with Delta.

54:14.960 --> 54:17.899
I don't know, maybe the fucking retards
will just run out of ammo.

54:18.061 --> 54:20.511
God damn,
this is gonna be a long night.

54:26.778 --> 54:28.601
<i>This is Assassin One. We are set.</i>

54:28.721 --> 54:31.124
<i>Assassin One, this is Assassin Two...</i>

54:31.890 --> 54:34.010
<i>Assassin One Two,
this is Assassin One Three,</i>

54:34.130 --> 54:37.780
<i>we have local enemy entrenched
400 meters to the north. Break.</i>

54:38.434 --> 54:40.173
<i>Possible enemy mortar position.</i>

54:40.293 --> 54:42.619
<i>- North 1,000 meters. Interrogative.
- Stay in line!</i>

54:42.739 --> 54:46.289
<i>Are you in the position to observe
and persecute the target?</i>

54:46.698 --> 54:49.056
<i>Assassin One Three,
this is Assassin One Two.</i>

54:49.176 --> 54:50.391
<i>We are static.</i>

54:51.426 --> 54:54.064
<i>Stand by while I roll
the Godfather back.</i>

54:54.382 --> 54:56.773
<i>Assassin One Two out. Break break.</i>

55:09.348 --> 55:12.038
They all got blankets on
to hide their heat signatures,

55:12.158 --> 55:13.538
right, Sergeant Colbert?

55:16.462 --> 55:20.312
A week ago, they didn't know
we could see their thermals at night.

55:21.740 --> 55:23.349
Now they're adapting.

55:25.806 --> 55:27.475
Didn't work for that guy.

55:27.595 --> 55:28.986
- Get down!
- No!

55:35.846 --> 55:36.970
Cease fire!

55:37.842 --> 55:39.872
Cease fucking fire, Sergeant!

55:40.912 --> 55:41.912
Sergeant!

55:42.450 --> 55:45.738
- Cease fire, motherfucker!
- Cease fire!

55:46.961 --> 55:48.240
Cease fire now!

55:49.778 --> 55:51.289
Cease fucking fire!

55:52.982 --> 55:54.884
Sergeant! What the fuck?

55:55.004 --> 55:57.013
My staff Sergeant told me
to engage all movement.

55:57.133 --> 55:59.127
What are you doing?
You dumb motherfucker,

55:59.287 --> 56:00.968
you realize you're shooting at Marines?

56:01.088 --> 56:02.652
I saw an Iraqi helmet.

56:03.621 --> 56:05.171
I got this, Corporal.

56:06.056 --> 56:06.884
Fuck.

56:07.318 --> 56:09.216
Two Actual, this is Two One.

56:09.336 --> 56:11.093
Who the fuck is shooting at us?

56:11.213 --> 56:13.238
Fuckin' L.A.P.D. cops from Delta!

56:13.534 --> 56:15.622
They fucking love shooting Mexicans.

56:15.742 --> 56:17.357
It was Alpha, Gabe.

56:17.477 --> 56:18.515
Alpha.

56:19.162 --> 56:20.428
Mistakes happen.

56:21.044 --> 56:23.294
<i>Two One Actual, what's your status?</i>

56:24.645 --> 56:27.731
Everyone likes to shoot Mexicans,
even Mexicans.

56:44.788 --> 56:46.638
Hitman Two, this is Two One.

56:46.961 --> 56:50.051
This is accurate mortar fire.
Request permission to egress.

56:50.476 --> 56:52.832
<i>Negative.
Our orders are to hold our position.</i>

56:52.952 --> 56:54.990
<i>We're blocking for Alpha. Over.</i>

56:55.110 --> 56:58.260
- There's a fuckin' braindead idea.
- That's a hold.

56:58.380 --> 57:00.061
We're covering Alpha's assault.

57:04.018 --> 57:04.871
Brad.

57:06.218 --> 57:09.009
Check out the retard
cas-evacing lamb chops.

57:12.526 --> 57:15.178
Man, that's fucking intense
when you think about it, homes.

57:15.298 --> 57:17.154
{I mean, }Here's this poor farmer
who's out there...

57:17.274 --> 57:18.711
{Ray, }Shut the fuck up.

57:47.780 --> 57:49.602
Fucking fish in a barrel.

57:50.110 --> 57:52.656
Same motherfuckers
who tried to smoke your ass.

58:00.116 --> 58:01.958
<i>...the most dramatic pictures
are showing</i>

58:02.118 --> 58:04.399
<i>American Marines in Baghdad city center</i>

58:04.519 --> 58:07.160
<i>pulling down a giant statue
of Saddam Hussein.</i>

58:07.280 --> 58:08.946
<i>Fighting seems to have come to an end...</i>

58:09.066 --> 58:11.431
- Turn that shit off.
- All right, fine.

58:12.992 --> 58:15.971
Apparently, these motherfuckers
up here don't listen to the BBC.

58:16.133 --> 58:18.365
No talking, no radio. Jeez, Brad.

58:27.222 --> 58:28.150
Grab the mag.

58:30.622 --> 58:33.825
- How about this guy over here?
- No, man, over here, J.J.

58:33.945 --> 58:36.547
- Bobby, use my camera too, man.
- Damn!

58:37.945 --> 58:40.288
- Fucking reservists, man.
- Just take the fucking photo.

58:42.055 --> 58:43.844
Be careful, Dan.
R.P.G. could be mined.

58:43.964 --> 58:45.998
Don't pick shit up till you check it.

58:46.118 --> 58:47.253
Copy that.

58:55.880 --> 58:58.139
- Get up. Get the fuck up.
- No no no.

58:58.299 --> 58:59.472
- Come on.
- Okay.

58:59.592 --> 59:00.970
- Okay, okay.
- Now.

59:04.946 --> 59:06.510
Got you covered, Eric.

59:06.765 --> 59:07.565
Hands.

59:08.431 --> 59:09.233
Come on.

59:10.031 --> 59:10.883
Hands.

59:12.477 --> 59:13.499
Thank you.

59:14.570 --> 59:16.907
You saved our asses.
{This is }It's the 1st real fighting we've seen.

59:17.067 --> 59:19.744
- You move and I'll blow your {ucking }head off.
- I have a family!

59:23.402 --> 59:25.822
We ought to cut his throat
like in the Chechen soldier video?

59:28.163 --> 59:30.478
Captain, sir... sir, what are you...

59:31.380 --> 59:33.199
Sir. Intimidation tactic.

59:33.981 --> 59:36.531
Sir, we got this situation
under control.

59:37.117 --> 59:39.055
- Fuck! Fuck!
- Bombs!

59:40.101 --> 59:42.123
We got a live one, men!

59:42.243 --> 59:43.475
Cover him, Redman.

59:46.218 --> 59:47.601
You motherfuckers.

59:47.854 --> 59:51.132
I'm sorry I shook your hand.
You abused that prisoner.

59:58.600 --> 01:00:00.419
Bravo Two, stay on line.

01:00:05.006 --> 01:00:07.083
- Hold your fire.
- No Saddam.

01:00:09.369 --> 01:00:10.286
Come.

01:00:14.527 --> 01:00:16.983
Looks like you won
some hearts and minds, sir.

01:00:17.103 --> 01:00:18.411
And some tongue.

01:00:23.768 --> 01:00:25.475
Check it out! We got their colors!

01:00:25.727 --> 01:00:26.527
Yeah!

01:00:28.588 --> 01:00:30.164
I love killing people!

01:00:30.509 --> 01:00:32.775
- Please, I'm a very low soldier.
- Fuck that.

01:00:33.221 --> 01:00:34.652
You were waiting to kill us.

01:00:35.259 --> 01:00:36.737
You didn't put your weapon down.

01:00:36.897 --> 01:00:40.670
I'm afraid if we put our weapons down,
the police will come and beat us.

01:00:40.790 --> 01:00:42.633
Everybody under Saddam is silent.

01:00:42.753 --> 01:00:44.835
If he say we go to war
with America, we say "good. "

01:00:44.955 --> 01:00:47.123
If he say we don't go to war
with America, we say "good. "

01:00:47.283 --> 01:00:48.421
Shit yeah.

01:00:48.541 --> 01:00:51.124
- We can't drop our weapons either.
- We got orders.

01:00:51.244 --> 01:00:53.671
- Next stop is Baghdad.
- Sweet, man.

01:00:54.568 --> 01:00:58.057
I don't want any war crimes in the back
of my truck. Untie his hands.

01:00:58.177 --> 01:00:59.559
Give him some water.

01:01:02.493 --> 01:01:03.812
You letting me go?

01:01:04.523 --> 01:01:05.873
How can I go home?

01:01:06.255 --> 01:01:08.138
My sergeant, he sees me,

01:01:08.258 --> 01:01:11.529
- he find out I didn't fight.
- Negro, ain't no Saddam.

01:01:12.116 --> 01:01:14.442
Know what I mean? Ain't no Iraqi army.

01:01:16.008 --> 01:01:18.158
You ain't got a sergeant no more.

01:01:18.435 --> 01:01:22.337
Either we killed his ass already or shit
he be running away faster than you.

01:01:22.457 --> 01:01:23.507
Feelin' me?

01:01:23.821 --> 01:01:25.683
You're going to Baghdad, my friend.

01:01:25.803 --> 01:01:27.697
We got
a prisoner collection center there.

01:01:27.817 --> 01:01:28.667
Baghdad?

01:01:29.539 --> 01:01:30.395
For free?

01:01:30.515 --> 01:01:32.481
I'm so happy. Thank you, thank you.
I'm so happy.

01:01:32.601 --> 01:01:33.836
It's all good, playboy.

01:01:33.996 --> 01:01:36.997
Thank you, thank you very much.
Thank you, thank you.

01:01:43.951 --> 01:01:45.469
Contact, two kliks!

01:01:49.449 --> 01:01:50.885
What the fuck, man?

01:01:51.717 --> 01:01:54.881
Don't these fucking guys know
that we won the war already?

01:01:57.269 --> 01:01:59.519
We got ambushed all the way up here.

01:02:00.057 --> 01:02:03.207
There still could be some
bad guys who want to play.

01:02:09.730 --> 01:02:11.465
God damn it, Ray.

01:02:12.506 --> 01:02:14.385
No country music.

01:02:15.491 --> 01:02:16.295
Okay?

01:02:16.667 --> 01:02:17.467
Dude,

01:02:17.587 --> 01:02:20.202
it's not a country song,
it's a cowboy song.

01:02:31.716 --> 01:02:33.766
I hate to break it to you, Ray,

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:35.648
but there are no cowboys.

01:03:29.254 --> 01:03:30.727
I don't give a fuckwhat you write.

01:03:30.847 --> 01:03:33.866
It's gonna come out all liberal
media bullshit spin on it anyway.

01:03:33.986 --> 01:03:36.030
Seriously, what am I supposed to do

01:03:36.150 --> 01:03:38.231
with all this bullshit
you guys constantly talk?

01:03:38.351 --> 01:03:40.408
You think I'm some sort
of racist psycho redneck?

01:03:40.528 --> 01:03:41.591
What, you ain't?

01:03:41.711 --> 01:03:45.219
And you ain't some fucking
militant taco-bender revolutionary?

01:03:45.339 --> 01:03:48.414
See, reporter? No outsider
can understand how we really are.

01:03:48.534 --> 01:03:49.809
We're all fucking brothers.

01:03:49.929 --> 01:03:52.814
- And we're all fucking alpha males{, too}.
- We{'ve} gotta constantly test each other.

01:03:52.934 --> 01:03:55.772
All we do is fight for position
in the pack, dawg.

01:03:55.892 --> 01:03:58.616
All that training we do,
the martial arts, to grappling...

01:03:58.736 --> 01:04:00.911
is for practice,
but it's also for real,

01:04:01.031 --> 01:04:02.769
to achieve dominance
over a motherfucker.

01:04:02.889 --> 01:04:04.277
We do the same thing mentally.

01:04:04.438 --> 01:04:05.631
It's prison rules, dawg.

01:04:05.751 --> 01:04:07.779
We probe for any fucking weakness
we can find...

01:04:07.899 --> 01:04:09.964
family, race, brains, looks...

01:04:10.084 --> 01:04:13.210
anything you have on a motherfucker,
you wear it the fuck out.

01:04:13.330 --> 01:04:15.182
Being a Marine
isn't about words, anyways.

01:04:15.302 --> 01:04:16.789
It's about your fucking actions.

01:04:17.023 --> 01:04:20.451
{Back home }In the civilian world, a fool slaps a
"protect the planet" sticker on his car,

01:04:20.571 --> 01:04:22.526
suddenly he's all about
the environment and shit.

01:04:22.646 --> 01:04:24.472
Don't matter that he {still }drives
that fucking car,

01:04:24.592 --> 01:04:26.314
fires up his computer and video games

01:04:26.434 --> 01:04:28.496
and cell phone every night
with electricity made

01:04:28.616 --> 01:04:31.891
from nuclear power, coal and
fucking melted baby seal oil.

01:04:32.011 --> 01:04:34.041
"nuh-uh, I got a dolphin sticker
on my shit,

01:04:34.161 --> 01:04:36.215
"so I'm all about saving
the fucking planet. "

01:04:36.335 --> 01:04:38.053
In our fucking Marine corps civilization

01:04:38.173 --> 01:04:39.956
it don't matter
what a motherfucker says.

01:04:40.076 --> 01:04:41.531
Only thing that matters is, dawg,

01:04:41.651 --> 01:04:43.700
when you charge
that motherfucking machinegun

01:04:43.820 --> 01:04:46.402
when the motherfucker tells you
to charge the motherfucking machinegun.

01:04:46.522 --> 01:04:48.903
Shit, everybody in this platoon
is a hard charger.

01:04:49.023 --> 01:04:51.795
Marines bitch about everything, man...
chow, fucking moron officers,

01:04:51.915 --> 01:04:53.218
no time for a combat jack...

01:04:53.338 --> 01:04:56.497
{But }You {will }never hear a Marine in this platoon
bitch that we could die at any second.

01:04:56.617 --> 01:04:58.413
- Hell no.
- That's what we signed up for.

01:04:58.533 --> 01:04:59.914
Hoorah that, motherfucker.

01:05:00.034 --> 01:05:03.002
Fucking care if some latte-sipping
bisexual college student

01:05:03.122 --> 01:05:05.239
reading about Justin Timberlake
in "Rolling Stone"

01:05:05.359 --> 01:05:07.515
thinks I'm a psycho racist cracker?
Fuck no.

01:05:07.635 --> 01:05:09.743
I'd give my life
for any brother in here.

01:05:09.863 --> 01:05:11.893
I know any one of them
would do the same for me.

01:05:12.013 --> 01:05:15.022
You think it matters
if I call fucking T a nigger?

01:05:15.142 --> 01:05:19.141
Fucking love that big dark green marine
and his big old beautiful nigger dick.

01:05:19.523 --> 01:05:21.355
Love all my dirty spic brothers here.

01:05:21.475 --> 01:05:25.326
And I love this fucking cracker-ass
inbred racist peckerwood fuck.

01:05:25.850 --> 01:05:28.376
I don't know why I do, dawg, but I do.

01:05:28.496 --> 01:05:30.201
'cause I'm pretty and I shave my balls.

01:05:30.321 --> 01:05:31.864
Want to touch 'em, reporter?

01:05:32.087 --> 01:05:33.076
No. Thanks.

01:05:34.536 --> 01:05:37.879
Look, man, I joined the Marine corps
10 days after I graduated high school.

01:05:37.999 --> 01:05:41.256
I went to school with all these
rich kids at St. Tammany's parish,

01:05:41.376 --> 01:05:42.713
but I was an apartment kid.

01:05:42.833 --> 01:05:45.727
My mom worked. I worked summers
digging footings on the weekends.

01:05:45.847 --> 01:05:47.763
I was a dishwasher
at D'Angelo's pizzeria.

01:05:47.883 --> 01:05:49.496
I busted my ass.

01:05:49.616 --> 01:05:51.828
Became a recon Marine since I was 19.

01:05:51.948 --> 01:05:53.174
My shit is tight as fuck.

01:05:53.294 --> 01:05:55.357
I know that, my brothers
in this platoon know that,

01:05:55.477 --> 01:05:56.889
so fuck all of you.

01:05:58.992 --> 01:06:01.981
Damn, war scribe, you just spit
on my fucking rack, dawg.

01:06:02.101 --> 01:06:03.576
- Where?
- There.

01:06:04.598 --> 01:06:06.605
You see that pile
of dried camel dung?

01:06:06.725 --> 01:06:09.992
That's my fucking pillow, dawg.
You fucking spit on it, fool.

01:06:10.352 --> 01:06:12.210
You're a heinous-asswhite boy.

01:06:12.330 --> 01:06:13.365
I'm sorry.
