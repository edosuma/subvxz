for these kids to spend

where they come from.

Yeah.

<i>[ man ]
Well, it all started
on the weekends.</i>

12:46.929 --> 12:49.132
Before I knew it,
it was every day,

12:49.198 --> 12:51.634
and I was dropping
thousands of dollars a month.

12:53.302 --> 12:55.471
You know, the funny thing is,

12:55.538 --> 12:57.774
I didn't think
I was doing anything Wrong.

12:57.840 --> 13:00.910
That was even before
I started freebasing.

13:00.977 --> 13:02.912
Cocaine Became
my best friend.

13:02.979 --> 13:07.049
<i>My career went out the window,
along with my wife and my home.</i>

13:07.116 --> 13:09.919
And that's when I decided
to come here.

13:09.986 --> 13:12.421
How long
have you been clean?

13:12.488 --> 13:14.423
Twenty days, Paul.

13:14.490 --> 13:16.526
I, uh, graduate tomorrow.

13:16.592 --> 13:18.961
Oh, that's wonderful,

13:24.167 --> 13:26.202
Stuart's lucky.

13:26.269 --> 13:29.739
Actually, it's not
that easy to quit.

13:29.806 --> 13:31.941
You've gotta constantly
be on guard...

13:32.008 --> 13:35.745
for those moments
when you feel
the most susceptible,

13:35.812 --> 13:39.482

to take your own special Drug.

13:42.385 --> 13:46.923
Nan, this is
your first time with us.

13:46.989 --> 13:48.991
What are you addicted to?

13:49.058 --> 13:51.761
Um, codeine.

13:51.828 --> 13:56.365
Now, just before you felt
the need to take the codeine,

13:56.432 --> 13:58.367
what were you usually doing?

13:58.434 --> 14:01.604
Well, I was--
I was at home.

14:01.671 --> 14:03.573
Go on.

14:04.941 --> 14:07.643
Last winter,
I had a cold.

14:07.710 --> 14:13.216
I can't take pills,
so my doctor prescribed
codeine cough medicine.

14:13.282 --> 14:15.952
I didn't realize until
way after the Cold was over...

14:16.018 --> 14:18.688
that I-- I was still
taking the stuff.

14:18.754 --> 14:20.790
Why do you think
you needed the codeine?

14:22.325 --> 14:24.227
Um--

14:25.928 --> 14:30.800
After-- After my Husband
went off to work
and the kids left for school,

14:32.702 --> 14:37.507
I'd find myself wandering
from room to room
in that big house of ours.

14:39.242 --> 14:42.145
I didn't know what to do
with myself.

14:42.211 --> 14:44.947

in this room.
Go ahead. Let it out.

<i>Yes, Peter.
This is Peter's second day.</i>

15:02.064 --> 15:04.000
Uh--

15:05.334 --> 15:08.404
All right,
I got a problem.

15:08.471 --> 15:11.941
I, uh--

15:13.309 --> 15:16.045
This is crazy.
I gotta go.

15:28.991 --> 15:34.330
<i>According to the abdominal
ultrasound, Mr. Rizzo,

We're starting 72-Hour fasting

15:40.837 --> 15:43.773
This is Dr. Ehrlich.
He's a surgical resident.

15:43.840 --> 15:46.409
Oh.
No, I only asked him
for a consult.

15:46.476 --> 15:48.411
Don't tell me.
Don't worry.

15:48.478 --> 15:50.880
They don't let us
operate anymore unless
the patient is Unconscious.

He's announcer

16:09.832 --> 16:12.101
Well, anyway,
I'm gonna wanna
have a look at you here.

16:12.168 --> 16:14.470
Oh, sure, that's what
all the surgeons say, huh?

16:14.537 --> 16:17.807
Oh, boy, you weren't kidding.
You've been through it
all right.

16:17.874 --> 16:21.611
They took your appendix out?
Yeah, August 11, 1978.

16:21.677 --> 16:24.080
<i>Woke up with cramps,

16:24.147 --> 16:26.149
<i>Thought it was
from this fish joint
down on the pier.</i>

16:26.215 --> 16:29.852
Fresh catch of the day, right?
Sure. Should have stayed
with the scampi.

16:29.919 --> 16:31.754
What about this one?

16:31.821 --> 16:33.756
Oh, that one.

16:33.823 --> 16:35.758
Super bowl Sunday, 1976.

16:35.825 --> 16:39.862
I lost 50 bucks
on the cowboys.
Damn that Bradshaw, huh?

16:39.929 --> 16:42.031
<i>I had a stinging pain
right after the game.
They went in.</i>

16:42.098 --> 16:44.033
<i>They had to take down
some Adhesions.</i>

That's pretty Good.

<i>Where'd you learn
your medicine?
Oh, you pick it up.</i>

Unfortunately.
[ chuckles ]

16:59.882 --> 17:01.818

anything abnormal here.

17:01.884 --> 17:04.287
Amazing.

17:04.353 --> 17:07.522
Your temperature's
back up to 102.
An hour ago it was normal.

17:07.589 --> 17:10.159
Uh, so what are you
gonna do?

17:10.226 --> 17:12.161
We're still in
the talking stage.

17:12.228 --> 17:15.164
Ah, you wanna go inside,
don't you?

17:15.231 --> 17:18.867
We may have to do
some exploratory surgery
to find out what's going on,

17:18.935 --> 17:22.003
if your angiogram is Normal.

17:22.070 --> 17:24.473
Hmm.
What do you think?

17:24.540 --> 17:27.643
Well, it's certainly
one possibility.

What do you say?

Nothing's definite yet,
Mr. Rizzo.

Ah, no problem.

So, consult.
Nice guy, huh?

18:10.086 --> 18:12.989
Yeah. How about
his abdomen?

18:13.055 --> 18:16.092
Well, it's hard to tell.
If there's a tumor,
it may not be palpable,

18:16.159 --> 18:18.094
Especially if
it's endocrine in origin.

18:18.161 --> 18:20.663
We should open him up
and look around.

18:20.730 --> 18:22.665
I don't know.
It just doesn't fit
together Somehow.

18:22.732 --> 18:28.037
His tests are negative
except for fluctuations
in Temperature and low sugar.

18:28.104 --> 18:31.741
I wanna think about it
and wait for serum
insulin Levels.

18:31.808 --> 18:34.210

another urine Sample.

18:41.451 --> 18:44.387
Okay, I'll send someone Down.
Thank you. Oh.

18:44.454 --> 18:48.458
What?
Would you get me
a temperature on him
every hour?

18:48.524 --> 18:50.460
Yeah, I'd be delighted to.

18:50.526 --> 18:53.062
Okay.
Okay. Thank you.

Is he allergic
to penicillin?
Um, no.

Any other drugs?
No, not that I know of.

19:00.002 --> 19:02.271
Hey, give me that, please.

19:02.338 --> 19:05.308
Has he had
any recent illnesses?
No.

19:05.374 --> 19:08.945
Has he had any complaints
lately? Fatigue?
No.

19:09.011 --> 19:12.048
Has he been eating normally?
Well, no--

19:12.115 --> 19:14.217
Put that down!

19:14.283 --> 19:17.053
Come on, Wayne,
what's the big deal?
We'll go out with them.

19:17.120 --> 19:19.689
We'll get some food.
We'll see a movie Maybe.
That'll be it.

19:19.755 --> 19:21.691
Look, I can think of
plenty of things
I'd rather do...

19:21.757 --> 19:23.793

Aw, he's not a bad guy.

things in his shirt pocket
with Pens and pencils in it.

What a lovely,
lovely day, Wayne."

now, but she wants us to meet
for lunch in the cafeteria.

You really don't
like me, do you, Shirley?
Come on, you'll see.

19:41.110 --> 19:44.714
We'll have a good time.
I used to sleep with her
all over the hospital.

19:44.781 --> 19:47.750
I don't care about that.
I have a history too.

19:47.817 --> 19:50.186

of Friendship.

Okay, okay,
I can handle it
if you can.

23:43.986 --> 23:49.959
But if you do,
Nothing is gonna change.

23:50.026 --> 23:52.462
Not for the better.

23:52.528 --> 23:55.798
You are the future
of your communities,

23:55.865 --> 23:58.301

23:58.367 --> 24:02.105
So put that in your pipe
and smoke it...

24:02.171 --> 24:07.076
before you start tossing out
a lot of wiseass questions
to me.

<i>That's all.

24:12.615 --> 24:15.384
If you feel that way,
why do you stay
at st. Eligius?

24:15.451 --> 24:18.521
Because I couldn't find
a better job.

<i>[ applause ]</i>

24:36.205 --> 24:39.108
Okay, Anthony.
Now that didn't
hurt a bit, did it?

24:39.175 --> 24:41.544
You're right,
it hurt a lot.
Anyway--

24:41.611 --> 24:43.880
That's what they
used to tell us to say
in nursing school.

24:43.946 --> 24:45.882
Well, you do this
all pretty Good.

24:45.948 --> 24:48.117
Yeah, I did. Thanks.
And I don't usually do this.

24:48.184 --> 24:50.186
But it seems like most of
our lab technicians...

24:50.253 --> 24:52.622
came down with
An acute case of spring fever.

24:52.688 --> 24:55.525
[ chuckles ]
So, uh, how long
you been a nurse?

24:55.591 --> 24:57.927
Oh, all my life.

24:57.994 --> 24:59.962
My ex-Wife always wanted
to be a nurse.
Yeah?

25:00.029 --> 25:02.465
Hated school though.
She's a hostess now...

25:02.532 --> 25:04.967
at one of those restaurants
on the mass turnpike.
Which exit?

25:05.034 --> 25:09.172
Fourteen.
So, uh, do you like it?
I mean, Nursing.

25:09.238 --> 25:13.376
Hmm, the hours are long
and the food stinks,
but I love being a nurse.

25:13.443 --> 25:16.379
Yeah.
Okay, open up. I wanna get
another temperature on you.

So what'd you guys think
about that power failure, huh?

25:36.199 --> 25:38.134
Caught me in the middle
of a shower.

down, big boy.
So, what happened?

25:41.704 --> 25:44.006
So anyway, Alice and I

25:44.073 --> 25:46.008

hot and heavy.
Mm-hmm.

25:46.075 --> 25:49.011
And she says, "I know I slept
with All those other guys
right away,

25:49.078 --> 25:51.013
but you're different, Victor,
you're special."

25:51.080 --> 25:53.883
You believe that?
Right.
What'd you do?

25:53.950 --> 25:56.686
So I said,
"No, you got it all wrong, babe.
I'm not different.

25:56.752 --> 25:58.955
I'm the same as
all the rest of 'em."

25:59.021 --> 26:01.357

You don't really

26:08.865 --> 26:12.368

Nice to see you, Wayne.

26:40.930 --> 26:42.865
There's some

Well, I--
Wayne can't.

27:11.227 --> 27:14.497
Oh.
Some other time then?

Yes.

What do you mean
I can't?

27:19.502 --> 27:21.838
If we went,
it wouldn't be so bad.

27:25.808 --> 27:28.111
<i>There was an opening
on the board
this afternoon,</i>

27:28.177 --> 27:32.115
so I slid
Anthony Rizzo into it.
Without checking with me?

27:32.181 --> 27:34.684
Well, I ran it by
Dr. London this morning.

27:34.750 --> 27:37.453
Rizzo hadn't eaten all day,
so he gave me the go-Ahead.

27:37.520 --> 27:39.956
Without checking with me.
I'm checking with you now.

27:40.022 --> 27:42.925
Not a chance, Victor.
Why?

27:42.992 --> 27:46.129
Rizzo's ready to go in.
Well, I'm not ready.

27:46.195 --> 27:48.698
You know,
your ambivalence
is really Frustrating.

27:48.765 --> 27:52.335
Yeah? So is your arrogance.
You're getting to be
a real surgeon.

27:52.401 --> 27:56.806
Well, excuse me, but the man
happens to have a tumor
in his pancreas, okay?

27:56.873 --> 27:59.442
Look at his insulin levels.
They're up, up, up.

27:59.509 --> 28:02.445
How come the C.T. Scan and all
the other tests are negative.
How do you explain that?

28:02.512 --> 28:05.515
Okay, most insulinomas
ARE too small to be seen
on x-Rays.

28:05.581 --> 28:07.550
The only way We're gonna know
is to open him up and explore.

28:07.617 --> 28:10.586
So, let's get on with it.
And if we don't
find anything?

28:10.653 --> 28:13.356
We sew him back up
and that's it.
I don't know.

28:13.422 --> 28:17.927
Oh, great, you don't know.
What don't you know?
You wanna do it, then do it.

28:39.048 --> 28:41.584
So you two guys finally
got things worked out, huh?

28:41.651 --> 28:43.719
<i>Well, Anthony,
we have reached
some sort of agreement.</i>

28:43.786 --> 28:46.088
But to be honest,
Dr. Morrison
still questions...

28:46.155 --> 28:48.391
whether Surgery really
is needed at this time.

28:48.458 --> 28:51.661
Yeah, I know, surgeons
versus internists, right?

28:51.727 --> 28:54.730
So, we do have you scheduled
for later this afternoon,

28:54.797 --> 28:58.734
but the final decision,
of course, is yours.

28:58.801 --> 29:01.270
You got reservations, huh?

29:01.337 --> 29:04.006
I feel we could hold off
a little longer
for additional testing.

29:04.073 --> 29:07.176
<i>I'd like to get
a c-Terminal insulin
to find out...</i>

Okay, let me explain
the procedure to you.
Oh, don't waste your breath.

you won't, right? Right.
That about sums it up.

Yeah, flunked out of cal.
Got caught with a low number
in the draft lottery.

30:31.894 --> 30:34.864
But I didn't think
the 82nd was involved
in the tet offensive.

loosen these up a little bit,

they're giving me bruises.
Please, they're really tight.
