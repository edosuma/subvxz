Hey, wake up!

02:51.505 --> 02:53.548
I'm home!

02:53.590 --> 02:56.927
Hey, girls. Aww, I missed you.

02:56.969 --> 02:58.887
Hey, Joseph. Hey, Michelle.

03:00.764 --> 03:02.557
- Hey.

03:00.764 --> 03:02.557
- Hey. It's 3:00 a.m.

03:02.599 --> 03:05.184
School starts tomorrow.

03:02.599 --> 03:05.184

Welcome back.

That's it? I-I've been on tour

03:08.355 --> 03:11.066
all summer and that's all I get?

03:11.108 --> 03:14.069
Next time, come home earlier.

03:17.322 --> 03:18.448
Becky!

03:21.451 --> 03:23.578
(Jesse)

03:21.451 --> 03:23.578
'Beck, I'm home. Wake up.'

03:23.620 --> 03:25.413
Beck, wake up.

03:26.331 --> 03:27.749
Jess, you're home.

03:27.791 --> 03:29.668
- Hey.

03:27.791 --> 03:29.668
- Hi, honey.

03:29.710 --> 03:31.920
Feels so good holding you

03:29.710 --> 03:31.920
in my arms.

03:31.962 --> 03:33.672
- Have mercy.

03:31.962 --> 03:33.672
- I know.

03:33.714 --> 03:35.841
I look like

03:33.714 --> 03:35.841
Frosty the Snowman.

03:35.883 --> 03:37.718
Aww, it's just that two weeks

03:35.883 --> 03:37.718
ago when I saw you

03:37.759 --> 03:40.470
you looked pregnant.

03:37.759 --> 03:40.470
But now you look, huh, enormous.

03:41.722 --> 03:43.515
Enormously pregnant.

03:43.557 --> 03:45.433
I know, it was amazing. I mean,

03:43.557 --> 03:45.433
one morning, I woke up

03:45.475 --> 03:47.477
looked down,

03:45.475 --> 03:47.477
and my feet were gone.

03:48.520 --> 03:50.438
Hey, how you doin', little baby?

03:50.480 --> 03:51.648
Daddy's home.

03:51.690 --> 03:53.608
It kicked.

03:51.690 --> 03:53.608
What's it doin' up so late?

03:55.402 --> 03:57.154
Honey, you have to

03:55.402 --> 03:57.154
read this book.

03:57.196 --> 03:59.698
It tells you everything you need

03:57.196 --> 03:59.698
to know about having a baby.

03:59.740 --> 04:00.991
Alright.

04:02.534 --> 04:04.828
"Chapter one.."

04:04.870 --> 04:06.872
I think we already

04:04.870 --> 04:06.872
covered that chapter.

04:11.210 --> 04:15.005
- I'm out of here, dad.

04:11.210 --> 04:15.005
- Oh, wait a minute. Come here.

04:15.047 --> 04:18.926
Aww, it's my big girl's

04:15.047 --> 04:18.926
first day of high school.

04:18.967 --> 04:21.136
- Come, sit on my lap.

04:18.967 --> 04:21.136
- Dad!

04:22.971 --> 04:25.515
Ah, seems like only yesterday

04:22.971 --> 04:25.515
I was holding you in my arms and

04:25.557 --> 04:28.102
I saw my reflection

04:25.557 --> 04:28.102
in your little bald head.

04:29.394 --> 04:31.980
Dad, I have to go.

04:29.394 --> 04:31.980
How do I look?

04:32.022 --> 04:33.732
Cute.

04:33.774 --> 04:35.275
Cute?

04:35.316 --> 04:37.152
You're supposed to say I look

04:35.316 --> 04:37.152
way too hot

04:37.194 --> 04:40.072
and can't leave the house

04:37.194 --> 04:40.072
dressed like this.

04:40.114 --> 04:42.282
I'm sorry, honey.

04:40.114 --> 04:42.282
You look very sexy.

04:45.535 --> 04:48.038
<i>Hola,</i> Deej, Big Dan.

04:48.080 --> 04:49.539
Hi, Kimmy.

04:49.581 --> 04:50.832
My, you look nice today.

04:50.874 --> 04:53.460
Thanks. My dad

04:50.874 --> 04:53.460
said the same thing.

04:53.501 --> 04:56.337
You see? Deej, you don't always

04:53.501 --> 04:56.337
have to dress hot

04:56.379 --> 04:58.048
to attract attention.

04:58.090 --> 05:00.717
People are gonna like you

05:00.759 --> 05:02.844
for who you are on the inside.

05:02.886 --> 05:05.430
(Danny)

05:02.886 --> 05:05.430
'Not how you look

05:02.886 --> 05:05.430
on the outside.'

05:05.472 --> 05:07.849
I know, it might seem weird

05:05.472 --> 05:07.849
for me to say this. But, uh..

05:11.352 --> 05:13.021
...I think right now you could

05:13.063 --> 05:14.940
actually learn a lesson

05:13.063 --> 05:14.940
from Kimmy.

05:19.194 --> 05:20.862
Ready, Deej?

05:20.904 --> 05:22.363
Well, I have to go back

05:20.904 --> 05:22.363
upstairs and change.

05:22.405 --> 05:24.074
My dad wants me to be

05:22.405 --> 05:24.074
more like you.

05:24.116 --> 05:27.035
No, no, no. You just,

05:24.116 --> 05:27.035
you go to school.

05:28.328 --> 05:31.498
- Please make new friends.

05:28.328 --> 05:31.498
- Bye, dad.

05:31.539 --> 05:33.000
- Bye.

05:34.709 --> 05:36.711
Alright, right this way.

05:34.709 --> 05:36.711
Bring it on down.

05:36.753 --> 05:38.421
Let's swing that back end

05:36.753 --> 05:38.421
around. Swing it around there.

05:38.463 --> 05:39.714
Right there.

05:41.883 --> 05:45.804
I'm an expectant mother.

05:41.883 --> 05:45.804
Not a jumbo jet.

05:45.846 --> 05:47.848
Please, the baby

05:45.846 --> 05:47.848
can pick up your sarcasm.

05:47.889 --> 05:49.641
What are you talking about?

05:49.683 --> 05:51.726
I've been up all night readin'

05:49.683 --> 05:51.726
that baby book and it says that

05:51.768 --> 05:53.436
even in the womb, the baby

05:51.768 --> 05:53.436
can sense everything

05:53.478 --> 05:55.647
that's going on, alright.

05:53.478 --> 05:55.647
So, starting right now

05:55.689 --> 06:00.194
I want happy voices

05:55.689 --> 06:00.194
and soothing sounds.

06:00.235 --> 06:02.570
Jess, don't you think you're

06:00.235 --> 06:02.570
goin' a little bit overboard?

06:02.612 --> 06:03.947
Oh, is that what you think?

06:03.989 --> 06:06.283
Hey, look, pal.

06:03.989 --> 06:06.283
I'm gonna be a father. Okay?

06:06.325 --> 06:07.951
You know what a big job that is?

06:07.993 --> 06:09.661
Oh, gosh, no, Jess. Tell me.

06:11.454 --> 06:12.539
That means

06:11.454 --> 06:12.539
I'm gonna be responsible

06:12.580 --> 06:14.708
for another human life. Okay.

06:14.749 --> 06:16.501
And I want it to

06:14.749 --> 06:16.501
start out right.

06:16.543 --> 06:18.586
So from now on,

06:16.543 --> 06:18.586
carry this around.

06:18.628 --> 06:22.799
♪ Well, since my baby

06:18.628 --> 06:22.799
left me, I found.. ♪♪

06:22.841 --> 06:26.385
Jess, I'm not gonna

06:22.841 --> 06:26.385
listen to Elvis 24 hours a day.

06:26.427 --> 06:28.096
I figured that, so..

06:33.018 --> 06:35.979
I bet its little lip's

06:33.018 --> 06:35.979

Oh, my god.

06:36.021 --> 06:37.647
It heard me call it, "it."

06:37.689 --> 06:39.816
Beck, we have to find out

06:37.689 --> 06:39.816
if it's a boy or a girl.

06:39.858 --> 06:41.902
No, Jess. You promised

06:39.858 --> 06:41.902
that we'd be surprised.

06:41.943 --> 06:43.320
Ah, tat tat.

06:43.362 --> 06:46.447
Happy sounds, soothing voices.

06:47.949 --> 06:51.410
No, now, Jess, you agreed

06:47.949 --> 06:51.410
that we'd be surprised.

06:51.452 --> 06:53.288
But I want you

06:51.452 --> 06:53.288
to change your mind.

06:53.330 --> 06:54.956
- It's not gonna happen.

06:53.330 --> 06:54.956
- Yes, it is.

06:54.998 --> 06:57.292
- No, it's not.

06:54.998 --> 06:57.292
- Yes, it is.

06:57.334 --> 07:01.380
Don't you worry. Your parents

06:57.334 --> 07:01.380
aren't always this kooky.

07:01.420 --> 07:03.590
- I'm not changing my mind.

07:01.420 --> 07:03.590
- Yes, you are.

07:03.631 --> 07:06.176
Hey, girls. Ready for

07:03.631 --> 07:06.176
your first day at school?

07:06.218 --> 07:09.428
Are you kidding? This year

07:06.218 --> 07:09.428
I'm getting a man teacher

07:09.470 --> 07:11.598
and he's a major babe.

07:11.639 --> 07:13.767
Ooh!

07:13.808 --> 07:17.062
Fourth grade is

07:13.808 --> 07:17.062
gonna be so awesome.

07:17.104 --> 07:18.688
Hey, I look good, I feel good

07:18.730 --> 07:20.190
and I'm wearing

07:18.730 --> 07:20.190
a smile that says

07:20.232 --> 07:22.234
"Stephanie Tanner,

07:20.232 --> 07:22.234
you're a winner."

07:24.652 --> 07:26.446
How 'bout you?

07:24.652 --> 07:26.446
Are you ready, Michelle?

07:26.487 --> 07:28.531
Not as ready as she is.

07:31.243 --> 07:34.162
Are the other kids

07:31.243 --> 07:34.162
gonna like me?

07:34.204 --> 07:37.207
Well, of course

07:34.204 --> 07:37.207
they're gonna like you.

07:37.249 --> 07:40.419
To be sure, you should do what

07:37.249 --> 07:40.419
I did my first day at school.

07:40.460 --> 07:43.130
See, when all the kids asked me

07:40.460 --> 07:43.130
my name, I just went..

07:43.171 --> 07:45.257
[imitating Bullwinkle]

07:43.171 --> 07:45.257
Hello. My name's Joey Gladstone.

07:47.634 --> 07:50.720
And all the kids laughed

07:47.634 --> 07:50.720
and we became friends.

07:50.762 --> 07:52.306
Okay, you try it.

07:52.347 --> 07:55.350
Hello. My name is

07:57.894 --> 08:01.189
That's good. But next time

07:57.894 --> 08:01.189
try using your own name.

08:01.231 --> 08:03.775

08:12.451 --> 08:15.620

08:12.451 --> 08:15.620
It's so big.

08:15.662 --> 08:17.872

08:15.662 --> 08:17.872

08:17.914 --> 08:20.292
I'm not that big.

08:20.334 --> 08:22.794
Michelle...you're gonna be fine.

08:22.836 --> 08:24.629
But if you need any help,

08:22.836 --> 08:24.629
your big sister's

08:24.671 --> 08:27.007
right in the same school.

08:24.671 --> 08:27.007
Right, Steph?

08:27.048 --> 08:29.968
Don't worry, Michelle.

08:27.048 --> 08:29.968
Kindergarten is like preschool.

08:30.010 --> 08:31.845
Only without the naps.

08:31.886 --> 08:34.014
Too bad. I'm good at naps.

08:35.056 --> 08:36.308
Come on, everybody.

08:38.226 --> 08:39.894
Are you comin', Michelle?

08:39.936 --> 08:42.439
I don't know about this.

08:42.481 --> 08:44.232
- Come on, hon.

08:42.481 --> 08:44.232
- Come on.

08:44.274 --> 08:45.608
Let's go.

08:47.319 --> 08:48.445
Jason.

08:50.155 --> 08:52.157
Well, here's your

08:50.155 --> 08:52.157
classroom, Michelle.

08:52.199 --> 08:54.284
Doesn't this look like the

08:52.199 --> 08:54.284
happiest place on earth?

08:54.326 --> 08:56.577
No, that's Disneyland.

08:56.619 --> 08:59.373
- Hello, I'm Miss Wiltrout.

08:56.619 --> 08:59.373
- Hi, I'm Danny Tanner.

08:59.414 --> 09:00.874
- And this is Joey.

08:59.414 --> 09:00.874
- Mr. Tanner.

09:00.915 --> 09:02.417
How do you do, Joey?

09:02.459 --> 09:05.170
- And what's your name?

09:02.459 --> 09:05.170
- Michelle Elizabeth Tanner.

09:05.212 --> 09:07.506
This is my first day at school.

09:07.547 --> 09:11.218
That's okay.

09:07.547 --> 09:11.218
It's everybody's first day.

09:11.259 --> 09:15.889
Oh, excuse me. Please don't

09:11.259 --> 09:15.889
climb on my desk there, Maxwell.

09:15.930 --> 09:18.850
Michelle, you have a great

09:15.930 --> 09:18.850
first day at school.

09:18.892 --> 09:20.227
I know you're gonna love it.

09:21.144 --> 09:22.979
You'll have fun, honey.

09:23.021 --> 09:24.481
I hope you're right.

09:26.566 --> 09:28.193
Hey, Michelle..

09:28.235 --> 09:31.321
...remember what I told you

09:28.235 --> 09:31.321
about making new friends. Hmm.

09:33.156 --> 09:35.325
- Bye, honey.

09:33.156 --> 09:35.325
- Bye, Michelle.

09:35.367 --> 09:36.910
- 'Bye-bye.'

09:35.367 --> 09:36.910
- Bye.

09:39.704 --> 09:41.081
[indistinct chatter]

09:42.332 --> 09:43.833
Who are you?

09:43.875 --> 09:46.461
My name is Michelle Tanner.

09:47.628 --> 09:51.299
You are a strange kid.

09:53.801 --> 09:56.555
They hate me already.

09:53.801 --> 09:56.555
I'm out of here.

10:01.351 --> 10:02.561
[bell ringing]

10:02.602 --> 10:04.604
Excuse me, excuse me.

10:04.645 --> 10:07.815
Have you seen my sister

10:04.645 --> 10:07.815
Stephanie Tanner?

10:14.197 --> 10:16.408
I don't know about this.

10:19.411 --> 10:21.662
Alright, let me help you

10:19.411 --> 10:21.662
down here.

10:21.704 --> 10:23.164
Ah, we'll just sit.

10:26.126 --> 10:28.836
Now remember, we don't wanna

10:26.126 --> 10:28.836
know if it's a boy or a girl.

10:28.878 --> 10:30.297
Okay. Alright.

10:28.878 --> 10:30.297
Yes, I understand.

10:30.338 --> 10:32.924
This is an interesting

10:30.338 --> 10:32.924
sonogram. Boy--

10:32.966 --> 10:35.260
It's a boy!

10:35.302 --> 10:37.178
We'll name him, we'll name him,

10:35.302 --> 10:37.178
uh, Jesse junior.

10:37.220 --> 10:39.055
How's his hair?

10:37.220 --> 10:39.055
Does he need mousse?

10:39.097 --> 10:41.433
I'm not saying it's a boy.

10:41.475 --> 10:43.393
Oh. Then it's a girl.

10:43.435 --> 10:45.645
Jessica junior.

10:45.686 --> 10:47.230
She's not datin' till she's 35.

10:47.272 --> 10:49.483
I didn't say it was a girl.

10:49.524 --> 10:51.109
What's left?

10:51.151 --> 10:53.861
All we wanna know is that

10:51.151 --> 10:53.861
the baby is healthy?

10:53.903 --> 10:56.364
Relax. You don't smoke

10:53.903 --> 10:56.364
and you don't drink.

10:56.406 --> 10:58.158
You're doing everything

10:56.406 --> 10:58.158
just right.

10:58.199 --> 10:59.784
The babies will be just fine.

10:59.826 --> 11:02.745
See that, Jess. The babies will

10:59.826 --> 11:02.745
be just fine. Now, let's go.

11:04.164 --> 11:06.082
Did you say babies?

11:06.833 --> 11:08.335
Did she say babies?

11:09.794 --> 11:12.130
That's what I said.

11:09.794 --> 11:12.130
You're having twins.

11:13.047 --> 11:14.215
Ha!

11:16.217 --> 11:18.637
Who's having twins?

11:18.677 --> 11:20.930
You are. Congratulations.

11:22.098 --> 11:24.601
Jess, we're having twins!

11:24.643 --> 11:26.102
Oh, honey!

11:29.314 --> 11:32.317
Twins, I...just wanted to know

11:29.314 --> 11:32.317
if it was a boy or a girl.

11:36.737 --> 11:38.697
Twins?

11:38.739 --> 11:41.951
We're having twins? That's, uh,

11:38.739 --> 11:41.951
that's two babies at one time?

11:41.993 --> 11:43.244
That's when like the

11:41.993 --> 11:43.244
first baby comes out

11:43.286 --> 11:44.496
then the second baby comes out.

11:44.538 --> 11:46.540
Then we take 'em home

11:44.538 --> 11:46.540
and raise 'em?

11:46.581 --> 11:48.458
That's generally how it works.

11:48.500 --> 11:50.043
Here's your sonogram.

11:50.084 --> 11:56.132
Oh, Jess, this is so exciting.

11:50.084 --> 11:56.132
Our first baby pictures!

11:56.174 --> 11:58.801
See, here's one little head

11:56.174 --> 11:58.801
and there's the other.

11:58.843 --> 12:00.595
Sometimes one hides

11:58.843 --> 12:00.595
behind the other.

12:00.637 --> 12:02.430
Oh, honey, that's so cute.

12:02.472 --> 12:04.558
They're already

12:02.472 --> 12:04.558
playing together.

12:06.142 --> 12:08.353
Any more hiding back there?

12:08.395 --> 12:10.938
- No.

12:08.395 --> 12:10.938
- Oh..

12:10.980 --> 12:13.441
This is so exciting. I've gotta

12:10.980 --> 12:13.441
get down to work, tell everyone.

12:13.483 --> 12:15.569
Okay. I'm gonna stay

12:13.483 --> 12:15.569
and ask a few questions.

12:15.610 --> 12:18.321
- Okay. We'll celebrate tonight.

12:15.610 --> 12:18.321
- Alright.

12:18.363 --> 12:20.532
Honey, we're having twins!

12:21.115 --> 12:22.367
Hee hee.

12:29.999 --> 12:31.918
Jesse, are you alright?

12:31.959 --> 12:34.546
Oh, no. No. I'm fine.

12:31.959 --> 12:34.546
No, I'm great. It's..

12:34.588 --> 12:37.882
...It's an extra baby,

12:34.588 --> 12:37.882
so I'm extra happy.

12:37.924 --> 12:39.884
You know, before I was

12:37.924 --> 12:39.884
just, uh, responsible

12:39.926 --> 12:43.388
for one human life. Now I'm

12:39.926 --> 12:43.388
responsible for two human lives.

12:43.430 --> 12:45.098
I'm fine. Really.

12:43.430 --> 12:45.098
I mean, I-I'm so..

12:45.139 --> 12:46.765
Can I just lay down

12:45.139 --> 12:46.765
real fast for a second?

12:48.268 --> 12:50.353
Can you just, uh,

12:48.268 --> 12:50.353
click the oxygen off that?

12:53.231 --> 12:56.025
And one of the most exciting

12:53.231 --> 12:56.025
things about fourth grade is

12:56.067 --> 12:59.487
that we'll be using...computers.

12:59.529 --> 13:01.322
So anyone ever used one?

13:01.364 --> 13:04.242
I've used my sister

13:01.364 --> 13:04.242
D.J.'s computer.

13:04.284 --> 13:05.619
She used up the last

13:04.284 --> 13:05.619
of the creme rinse

13:05.660 --> 13:07.328
in the shower this morning.

13:07.370 --> 13:09.330
That's why my hair doesn't have

13:07.370 --> 13:09.330
as much body and bounce

13:09.372 --> 13:10.831
as it usually does.

13:14.586 --> 13:16.296
I guess I'll sit down now.

13:17.547 --> 13:19.048
I'm really not a geek.

13:20.174 --> 13:21.676
(male #1)

13:20.174 --> 13:21.676
'No one said you were.'

13:23.428 --> 13:25.221
Alright. Another thing

13:23.428 --> 13:25.221
we're gonna be doing

13:25.263 --> 13:28.182
is breaking the class

13:25.263 --> 13:28.182
into discovery groups.

13:31.352 --> 13:34.773
(male #1)

13:31.352 --> 13:34.773
'And here's our

13:31.352 --> 13:34.773
first discovery.'

13:36.232 --> 13:38.276
Psst. It's me, Michelle.

13:39.736 --> 13:41.529
I know who you are.

13:41.571 --> 13:45.533
Stephanie, would you like to

13:41.571 --> 13:45.533
introduce us to your guest?

13:45.575 --> 13:49.663
- Not really.

13:45.575 --> 13:49.663
- I'm her sister, Michelle.

13:49.704 --> 13:51.998
Hi. I'm Mr. Lowry.

13:52.039 --> 13:55.918
You were right.

13:52.039 --> 13:55.918
He is a major babe!

14:01.840 --> 14:04.093
Why aren't you

14:01.840 --> 14:04.093
in kindergarten?

14:04.135 --> 14:07.764
Nobody likes me there.

14:04.135 --> 14:07.764
I wanna stay with you.

14:12.435 --> 14:14.228
What a sense of humor.

14:14.270 --> 14:15.938
Can I take her back

14:14.270 --> 14:15.938
to kindergarten?

14:15.980 --> 14:17.816
Of course you can.

14:17.856 --> 14:21.778
Thanks. But, uh, try not to

14:17.856 --> 14:21.778
teach anything until I get back.

14:23.655 --> 14:25.824
I don't wanna go back.

14:25.865 --> 14:29.327
Don't worry, Michelle.

14:25.865 --> 14:29.327
Your big sister's on the job.

14:29.369 --> 14:31.037
Now, there's no reason why

14:29.369 --> 14:31.037
any of those

14:31.078 --> 14:32.497
kindergarten kids

14:31.078 --> 14:32.497
shouldn't like you.

14:32.539 --> 14:35.291
I mean, you're a terrific

14:32.539 --> 14:35.291
little person.

14:35.333 --> 14:37.377
Don't tell me, tell them.

14:40.839 --> 14:42.590
Look what I found.

14:42.632 --> 14:45.635
There you are, Michelle.

14:42.632 --> 14:45.635
What happened?

14:45.677 --> 14:48.304
That boy said I was strange.

14:48.346 --> 14:51.265
She talks with her hands

14:48.346 --> 14:51.265
on her head.

14:52.225 --> 14:53.601
I think I can help here.

14:53.643 --> 14:56.646
- May I?

14:53.643 --> 14:56.646
- Oh, be my guest.

14:58.981 --> 15:00.608
Michelle was just

14:58.981 --> 15:00.608
trying to show you kids

15:00.650 --> 15:02.610
the cool new way to say hello.

15:02.652 --> 15:04.278
The Bullwinkle way.

15:05.363 --> 15:06.906
Okay. Antlers up.

15:08.616 --> 15:10.451
Now repeat after me.

15:10.493 --> 15:12.620
[imitating Bullwinkle]

15:10.493 --> 15:12.620
Good morning, Michelle.

15:12.662 --> 15:14.748
[in unison]

15:12.662 --> 15:14.748
Good morning, Michelle!

15:14.789 --> 15:16.957
Good morning to you.

15:16.999 --> 15:19.502
[laughing]

15:19.544 --> 15:21.588
Wasn't that fun?

15:19.544 --> 15:21.588
Let's all thank Michelle

15:21.629 --> 15:23.715
for showing us how to be

15:21.629 --> 15:23.715
a little bit cooler.

15:23.757 --> 15:25.550
(altogether)

15:23.757 --> 15:25.550
Yay!

15:27.134 --> 15:29.429
See, Michelle. They like you.

15:29.470 --> 15:31.138
Well, my work here is done.

15:31.723 --> 15:33.850
Aw, good job.

15:35.435 --> 15:37.019
Stephanie?

15:37.061 --> 15:38.605
Yes, Michelle?

15:38.646 --> 15:40.732
Thank you very much.

15:41.524 --> 15:42.859
You're welcome.

15:46.237 --> 15:48.489
Good boy, Comet.

15:46.237 --> 15:48.489
You cleaned your plate.

15:48.531 --> 15:50.199
Now remember what I taught you.

15:51.659 --> 15:52.869
(Danny)

15:51.659 --> 15:52.869
'Atta-boy, Comet.'

15:54.203 --> 15:56.080
'Aww, good dog.'

15:56.539 --> 15:57.665
'Yes.'

16:01.544 --> 16:03.713
You know. Joey, you can

16:01.544 --> 16:03.713
learn somethin' from that dog.

16:06.340 --> 16:08.342
- Oh, hi, guys.

16:06.340 --> 16:08.342
- 'Hey, Jess!'

16:08.384 --> 16:11.304
Congratulations, man.

16:08.384 --> 16:11.304
You're havin' twins.

16:11.345 --> 16:15.182
Way to go, buddy boy. When you

16:11.345 --> 16:15.182
do somethin', you really do it.

16:15.224 --> 16:16.976
Huh?

16:17.017 --> 16:20.647
- Where have you been all day?

16:17.017 --> 16:20.647
- I was at the doctor's office.

16:20.688 --> 16:22.690
Your appointment was

16:20.688 --> 16:22.690
three hours ago.

16:22.732 --> 16:25.109
I forgot I had a car.

16:25.151 --> 16:29.363
It's...my head's

16:25.151 --> 16:29.363
just kind of jammed. I mean, I..

16:29.405 --> 16:30.448
...I mean, you know,

16:29.405 --> 16:30.448
havin' a baby's great

16:30.490 --> 16:31.616
but having twins..

16:31.658 --> 16:33.242
Twins are gonna be

16:31.658 --> 16:33.242
twice as great.

16:33.284 --> 16:36.370
Twice the love, twice the hugs,

16:33.284 --> 16:36.370
twice the kisses.

16:39.415 --> 16:41.584
It's not that simple, Jesse boy.

16:41.626 --> 16:44.086
Twins are twice the feeding,

16:41.626 --> 16:44.086
twice the crying

16:44.128 --> 16:47.548
twice the diapers,

16:44.128 --> 16:47.548
and twice the responsibility.

16:47.590 --> 16:48.633
Who are you?

16:48.675 --> 16:51.803
I'm your evil twin,

16:48.675 --> 16:51.803
Manny Tanner.

16:51.845 --> 16:53.888
You need shower, Manny.

16:53.930 --> 16:56.933
Yes. Twins will mean twice as

16:53.930 --> 16:56.933
many "I love you, daddy"s.

16:59.143 --> 17:02.647
You live in a bubble,

16:59.143 --> 17:02.647
you Lysol-loving hug freak.

17:06.108 --> 17:07.735
I'm crackin' up here.

17:07.777 --> 17:10.571
Come on, Jess. You're gonna

17:07.777 --> 17:10.571
make a great father.

17:10.613 --> 17:12.699
What do you know?

17:10.613 --> 17:12.699
You're 33 years old

17:12.740 --> 17:16.410
and you wear

17:12.740 --> 17:16.410
Scooby Doo pajamas.

17:16.452 --> 17:19.455
Just the bottoms. And I suppose

17:16.452 --> 17:19.455
you're my evil twin.

17:19.497 --> 17:22.291
Yeah. What was your

17:19.497 --> 17:22.291
first clue, Sherlock?

17:22.333 --> 17:24.168
Well, you look a lot like me.

17:24.210 --> 17:27.296
Hey, Jess. You can kiss your

17:24.210 --> 17:27.296
rock 'n' roll days goodbye.

17:27.338 --> 17:29.465
'You won't look so cool

17:27.338 --> 17:29.465
with a twin on each arm'

17:29.507 --> 17:32.301
and a spit-up rag

17:29.507 --> 17:32.301
on each shoulder.

17:32.343 --> 17:34.470
You know, for an evil twin,

17:32.343 --> 17:34.470
you're not very nice.

17:34.512 --> 17:36.305
Oh, good comeback.

17:38.975 --> 17:40.059
Yeah.

17:40.100 --> 17:41.853
You know,

17:40.100 --> 17:41.853
I'm really sick of you.

17:41.895 --> 17:43.604
[indistinct chatter]

17:45.773 --> 17:48.067
Would the four

17:45.773 --> 17:48.067
of you guys just stop?

17:49.861 --> 17:52.780
Oh. Oh, thank god.

17:49.861 --> 17:52.780
It's just the two of you guys.

17:54.490 --> 17:56.075
You know, Jess.

17:54.490 --> 17:56.075
You've been up all night.

17:56.116 --> 17:57.660
I think you just need

17:56.116 --> 17:57.660
to get some sleep.

17:57.702 --> 17:59.203
No, no, no.

17:57.702 --> 17:59.203
I don't need any sleep.

18:07.879 --> 18:09.881
Maybe a little nap

18:07.879 --> 18:09.881
wouldn't hurt.

18:18.389 --> 18:20.892
Hi, Uncle Jesse. Wanna play?

18:20.934 --> 18:22.351
Not right now, shorty.

18:20.934 --> 18:22.351
I got, uh..

18:22.393 --> 18:25.145
...lot of stuff

18:22.393 --> 18:25.145
goin' on my mind. Thanks.

18:25.187 --> 18:29.067
Not so fast, mister.

18:25.187 --> 18:29.067
Park it right here.

18:30.651 --> 18:32.946
Michelle, I-I really

18:30.651 --> 18:32.946
don't wanna talk right now.

18:32.987 --> 18:35.448
You always talk to me.

18:36.574 --> 18:38.034
I guess you're right.

18:38.076 --> 18:40.244
I've been spillin'

18:38.076 --> 18:40.244
my guts to you

18:40.286 --> 18:43.039
since before you were able

18:40.286 --> 18:43.039
to talk back, huh?

18:43.081 --> 18:44.791
Spill those guts.

18:47.043 --> 18:49.545
Well, you heard about

18:47.043 --> 18:49.545
this twins thing, right?

18:49.587 --> 18:52.172
Yes, I did.

18:49.587 --> 18:52.172
I'm very proud of you.

18:53.883 --> 18:57.511
Now, thank you, but,

18:53.883 --> 18:57.511
uh, I don't know.

18:57.553 --> 18:59.513
I guess I'm just apprehensive.

18:59.555 --> 19:01.057
Appre-what?

19:03.267 --> 19:06.062
Apprehensive. It means, um..

19:06.104 --> 19:10.316
...it means that

19:06.104 --> 19:10.316
I'm nervous... about the twins.

19:10.357 --> 19:12.860
This has got to be our little

19:10.357 --> 19:12.860
secret, okay? Because..

19:12.902 --> 19:15.780
...I'm afraid to talk

19:12.902 --> 19:15.780
to the family 'bout it.

19:15.822 --> 19:17.782
You know, they think of me

19:15.822 --> 19:17.782
as bein', you know

19:17.824 --> 19:21.201
so together and in control

19:17.824 --> 19:21.201
all the time I just..

19:21.243 --> 19:23.830
I just don't want them

19:21.243 --> 19:23.830
to see me like this.

19:25.289 --> 19:27.207
I don't know what to do.

19:27.249 --> 19:29.919
- I do.

19:27.249 --> 19:29.919
- You do?

19:29.961 --> 19:31.879
Stephanie!

19:31.921 --> 19:33.547
What are you doing, Michelle?

19:33.589 --> 19:36.592
Stephanie helped me at school.

19:33.589 --> 19:36.592
She's a genius.

19:38.385 --> 19:41.305
- What's wrong, Michelle?

19:38.385 --> 19:41.305
- Nothing. Nothing's wrong.

19:41.347 --> 19:45.267
Uncle Jesse's apprehensive.

19:41.347 --> 19:45.267
That means nervous.

19:45.309 --> 19:47.478
Oh, I-I'm fine, Steph.

19:45.309 --> 19:47.478
I'm fine, alright.

19:47.520 --> 19:49.939
No offense, but I-I think

19:47.520 --> 19:49.939
you're just a little young

19:49.981 --> 19:51.357
for this problem.

19:51.398 --> 19:54.110
Okay. In that case...D.J.!

19:56.737 --> 19:58.948
- What is it?

19:56.737 --> 19:58.948
- Uncle Jesse's apprehensive.

19:58.990 --> 20:01.617
No, I-I'm not apprehensive.

19:58.990 --> 20:01.617
I'm fine. Okay, girls.

20:01.659 --> 20:03.243
Now, this is an adult thing.

20:03.285 --> 20:07.165
No problem.

20:03.285 --> 20:07.165
Dad! Joey! Aunt Becky!

20:07.206 --> 20:09.416
Uncle Jesse's apprehensive!

20:10.877 --> 20:12.294
- 'Who's apprehensive?'

20:10.877 --> 20:12.294
- I'm fine!

20:12.336 --> 20:14.130
Everybody, I'm fine, okay.

20:12.336 --> 20:14.130
I'm fine.

20:14.172 --> 20:17.175
I'm just, uh, just havin'

20:14.172 --> 20:17.175
a bad hair day, that's all.

20:18.467 --> 20:22.429
Little, uh, apprehensive

20:18.467 --> 20:22.429
about my ph balance.

20:22.471 --> 20:25.558
You said you were

20:22.471 --> 20:25.558
apprehensive about the twins.

20:27.018 --> 20:29.603
Here's another new word

20:27.018 --> 20:29.603
for ya..."Blabber-mouth".

20:30.771 --> 20:32.356
- I know that one.

20:30.771 --> 20:32.356
- 'Hmm.'

20:33.733 --> 20:36.736
Jess, I thought you were

20:33.733 --> 20:36.736
happy about the twins.

20:36.777 --> 20:39.822
I am. I-I'm extremely happy.

20:40.781 --> 20:42.200
I'm happy.

20:42.241 --> 20:43.367
Thrilled.

20:46.245 --> 20:47.538
I'm lying.

20:53.711 --> 20:56.172
Becky, I'm scared to death.

20:56.214 --> 20:59.341
Uncle Jesse,

20:56.214 --> 20:59.341
you're never scared.

20:59.383 --> 21:01.301
Yeah, well, I've never

20:59.383 --> 21:01.301
been a father before.

21:02.636 --> 21:04.638
I mean, you know,

21:02.636 --> 21:04.638
havin' one kid is scary enough

21:04.680 --> 21:06.807
but the thought of havin' two..

21:06.849 --> 21:09.143
You're the greatest uncle

21:06.849 --> 21:09.143
in the world.

21:09.185 --> 21:11.020
Yeah, but bein' an uncle

21:09.185 --> 21:11.020
is easy. I mean, I..

21:11.062 --> 21:13.064
I listen to your problem,

21:11.062 --> 21:13.064
I throw in my two cents

21:13.106 --> 21:14.815
then I dump the final decision

21:13.106 --> 21:14.815
on your dad.

21:16.776 --> 21:19.528
Now I'm gonna be

21:16.776 --> 21:19.528
totally responsible.

21:19.570 --> 21:22.573
My, my babies' lives

21:19.570 --> 21:22.573
gonna be in my hands.

21:22.615 --> 21:25.159
If I make one wrong decision,

21:22.615 --> 21:25.159
and I screw up two lives.

21:27.411 --> 21:29.914
I'm sorry, Becky.

21:29.956 --> 21:32.833
You must think I'm a jerk.

21:32.875 --> 21:36.129
No, honey.

21:32.875 --> 21:36.129
I'm just as scared as you.

21:36.170 --> 21:38.214
Oh, great. Who's gonna

21:36.170 --> 21:38.214
take care of our kids?

21:40.133 --> 21:41.717
You know, what you guys

21:40.133 --> 21:41.717
are going through

21:41.759 --> 21:44.595
is perfectly normal.

21:44.637 --> 21:48.182
I was a nervous wreck the

21:44.637 --> 21:48.182
first time I became a parent.

21:48.224 --> 21:50.851
Once you hold that

21:48.224 --> 21:50.851
little baby in your arms

21:50.893 --> 21:53.229
I'm tellin' you,

21:50.893 --> 21:53.229
you can't believe the feeling.

21:55.231 --> 21:57.608
Come on. You two

21:55.231 --> 21:57.608
are gonna make great parents.

21:57.650 --> 22:00.319
And just remember we'll be here

21:57.650 --> 22:00.319
whenever you need us.

22:00.360 --> 22:03.405
Jess, for the past four years,

22:00.360 --> 22:03.405
you've been livin' in this house

22:03.447 --> 22:06.284
and you've been, Uncle Jesse.

22:06.325 --> 22:09.912
But now, I'm gonna get to be,

22:06.325 --> 22:09.912
Uncle Danny.

22:11.497 --> 22:14.125
Your kids are gonna be so clean.

22:15.793 --> 22:18.171
I'll babysit my new

22:15.793 --> 22:18.171
cousins anytime.

22:18.212 --> 22:20.464
Except for Friday

22:18.212 --> 22:20.464
and Saturday nights.

22:20.506 --> 22:23.676
And I'll take Friday and

22:20.506 --> 22:23.676
Saturday, until I start dating.

22:25.303 --> 22:29.015
I'll help, too, but no diapers.

22:25.303 --> 22:29.015
They make me apprehensive.

22:31.600 --> 22:35.229
Thank you, guys. I'm still

22:31.600 --> 22:35.229
a little scared but..

22:35.271 --> 22:36.814
...knowin' that I've got

22:35.271 --> 22:36.814
you guys to back me up

22:36.856 --> 22:39.108
really makes me feel happy.

22:39.150 --> 22:40.693
Well, honey.

22:39.150 --> 22:40.693
I am sure that we're gonna make

22:40.734 --> 22:44.655
our share of mistakes

22:40.734 --> 22:44.655
but one thing's for sure.

22:44.697 --> 22:47.116
No two kids are

22:44.697 --> 22:47.116
gonna be loved more.

22:47.158 --> 22:48.617
You can count on that.

22:50.036 --> 22:51.996
Well, you guys gotta see

22:50.036 --> 22:51.996
our first baby pictures.

22:52.538 --> 22:53.914
Hey!

22:54.581 --> 22:56.416
- Aw.

22:56.458 --> 22:58.502
Aren't they cute?

22:58.544 --> 23:00.462
They'll look a lot better

22:58.544 --> 23:00.462
once they get eyebrows.

23:04.008 --> 23:07.094
