WEBVTT

00:55.533 --> 00:57.535
You know,
bakeries are dangerous places.

00:59.581 --> 01:01.670
Flour is flammable,
you know that, right?

01:01.713 --> 01:03.715
They've got these
particles

01:03.759 --> 01:05.413
that kind of float
all over a room.

01:05.456 --> 01:07.893
I mean, just one of them
catches fire,

01:07.937 --> 01:09.243
the whole place just kind of

01:09.286 --> 01:12.289
goes up like a tinderbox.

01:25.041 --> 01:26.477
I got it.

01:34.616 --> 01:37.619
Ricky: The boredom is a killer,
you know?

01:39.011 --> 01:41.013
Aren't you bored?

01:41.057 --> 01:43.625
Uh, yeah, at first,

01:43.668 --> 01:47.629
but, uh...

01:47.672 --> 01:51.067
I had enough good times.

01:51.111 --> 01:54.026
So you're content with being
some fucking robot?

01:54.070 --> 01:56.507
'Cause I'm not.

01:56.551 --> 01:58.118
Can't do this much longer.

01:58.161 --> 02:00.424
I guess what you've been doing
up to this point

02:00.468 --> 02:02.252
has been working out
so well, huh?

02:02.296 --> 02:04.124
See, even that.

02:04.167 --> 02:06.865
You sound
like a fucking robot.

02:06.909 --> 02:10.869
99 out of 100 of you guys
will say that same exact shit.

02:10.913 --> 02:13.263
And the other guy would say
"You're sitting here getting fat

02:13.307 --> 02:15.265
while your disease is out back
doing push-ups."

02:15.309 --> 02:17.311
- Yo, it's not funny.

02:19.704 --> 02:21.706
Okay.

02:23.491 --> 02:25.275
I gotta go.
You cover this?

02:25.319 --> 02:27.321
- I got you next time?
- Yeah, sure.

02:29.627 --> 02:31.586
Hey, you call me
if you need me.

02:31.629 --> 02:33.631
Yeah.

03:10.973 --> 03:12.931
Isabel: Hi, everybody.
My name is Isabel.

03:12.975 --> 03:14.542
I'm a recovering alcoholic.

03:14.585 --> 03:16.631
All: Hi, Isabel.

03:16.674 --> 03:19.634
And I've been in and out
of these rooms for years.

03:19.677 --> 03:22.637
Until I finally had the guts
to tell my sponsor

03:22.680 --> 03:25.640
what made me wanna get sober
in the first place.

03:27.685 --> 03:30.645
I killed someone.

03:30.688 --> 03:32.864
I was driving home
and I hit a guy.

03:32.908 --> 03:35.780
And I was so loaded
I didn't even slow down.

03:35.824 --> 03:38.566
I drove home waiting for the
police to show up at the door

03:38.609 --> 03:39.915
and they never did.

03:39.958 --> 03:43.919
My sponsor told me
what I had to do.

03:43.962 --> 03:46.661
I had to turn myself in

03:46.704 --> 03:48.663
and make amends to his family.

03:48.706 --> 03:50.273
And she told me this,

03:50.317 --> 03:52.275
"His family may never
forgive you,

03:52.319 --> 03:54.277
and you will go to prison,

03:54.321 --> 03:56.279
but you'll have some of us
out here

03:56.323 --> 03:58.150
and you'll have some of us
in there.

03:58.194 --> 04:02.329
'Cause out here with all
the lies and the guilt,

04:02.372 --> 04:05.375
you'll be less free
than you'll be in there."

04:14.906 --> 04:16.821
John: We're years out,

04:16.865 --> 04:19.824
but my guys think they have
isolated a cluster of cells

04:19.868 --> 04:22.523
that can be built
into a filter.

04:22.566 --> 04:27.179
Salt water goes in and
fresh water comes out.

04:27.223 --> 04:30.618
What about the resulting
overpopulation?

04:30.661 --> 04:33.577
Problems ascribed to
overpopulation are...

04:33.621 --> 04:35.579
political contrivances.

04:35.623 --> 04:37.581
Misbehavior of power.

04:37.625 --> 04:39.931
You know that.

04:39.975 --> 04:43.283
You know, John, for one
of the richest guys I know,

04:43.326 --> 04:45.589
you sound an awful lot
like a communist.

04:45.633 --> 04:47.591
According to the internet,

04:47.635 --> 04:50.594
you're one of the richest guys
anybody knows,

04:50.638 --> 04:53.597
but every time we talk
about overpopulation,

04:53.641 --> 04:55.643
you sound like an asshole.

04:55.686 --> 04:57.862
Remind me again,
what's the internet?

04:57.906 --> 05:00.343
Oh, come on, Max, don't pretend
like you're an old fart,
all right?

05:00.387 --> 05:01.823
I know you better than this.

05:01.866 --> 05:03.477
Nick, do me a favor.

05:03.520 --> 05:05.479
In the future, in say
ten years from now,

05:05.522 --> 05:07.481
you ever catch me bragging

05:07.524 --> 05:11.398
that I had dinner
with John Ives, shoot me.

05:11.441 --> 05:14.401
You know, Max,

05:14.444 --> 05:16.141
I'll do you a favor

05:16.185 --> 05:17.926
and I'll shoot you myself.

05:19.928 --> 05:23.366
Well, you impressed me
at least.

05:23.410 --> 05:25.934
Well, that's because
you are a communist.

05:25.977 --> 05:27.501
Oh, very funny.

05:27.544 --> 05:29.720
Max may look
like a "Bond" villain,

05:29.764 --> 05:32.288
but he's got a good heart
and I think you made your point.

05:32.332 --> 05:35.291
You ready to go home, Red?

05:35.335 --> 05:37.293
Let's get outta here.

05:37.337 --> 05:39.295
Now?

05:39.339 --> 05:40.818
Yeah, Maria's gotta go
to sleep.

05:40.862 --> 05:44.169
Maria, put Ethan
to bed long ago.

05:44.213 --> 05:47.172
And right now she's falling
asleep in front of the TV.

05:47.216 --> 05:48.435
You're gonna dance with me.

05:48.478 --> 05:50.437
I'm gonna...

05:50.480 --> 05:52.090
- I'm gonna dance with you?
- Mm-hmm.

06:33.218 --> 06:34.437
Selene.

07:25.836 --> 07:28.796
There's a Mrs. Ives
to see you.

07:28.839 --> 07:31.015
Mrs. Ives.

07:31.059 --> 07:33.061
She's in conference
room three.

07:36.064 --> 07:39.023
- Tell her I'll be there
in ten minutes.
- Okay.

08:05.354 --> 08:07.965
You know, I--

08:08.009 --> 08:10.141
I read about your son,

08:10.185 --> 08:12.666
and I'm sorry for your loss.

08:14.668 --> 08:17.497
Thank you.

08:17.540 --> 08:20.500
It's been hard on John.

08:20.543 --> 08:22.545
How have you been?

08:33.991 --> 08:35.993
I miss him so much.

08:39.082 --> 08:40.563
I'd give...

08:40.607 --> 08:42.609
I'd give anything
to have him back.

08:44.611 --> 08:47.614
But I know that's crazy,
isn't it?

08:51.052 --> 08:53.620
No.

08:53.663 --> 08:57.145
I don't think that's crazy.

08:57.188 --> 09:00.191
I know why you're here.

09:02.672 --> 09:05.675
It is possible.

09:11.725 --> 09:15.729
The answer is yes.

09:22.605 --> 09:24.955
John:
They cloned a sheep.

09:24.999 --> 09:27.262
You're talking
about a human being.

09:27.305 --> 09:31.832
Selene:
All he needs is Ethan's DNA.

09:43.583 --> 09:46.586
We can finally
move on, John.

09:59.468 --> 10:02.471
This isn't moving on.

10:04.604 --> 10:06.736
He can bring Ethan back.

10:08.782 --> 10:11.393
The technology is there,
John.

10:11.436 --> 10:14.439
He can clone him.

10:37.288 --> 10:40.074
No.

10:40.117 --> 10:43.120
I can't.

10:48.735 --> 10:51.738
You don't have to.

10:56.656 --> 10:58.614
- I'm sorry.
- I can't.

10:58.658 --> 11:00.660
I can't.

12:55.339 --> 12:58.299
Sit down.

12:58.342 --> 13:01.345
Look at me.

13:11.355 --> 13:13.314
Come to my room.

13:13.357 --> 13:15.925
I'll let you touch.

15:16.741 --> 15:18.395
Fuck!

15:18.439 --> 15:20.615
You fuck!

15:20.658 --> 15:23.618
Get the fuck--

18:45.211 --> 18:48.214
What happens when Nick starts
to look like Ethan?

18:48.257 --> 18:51.260
What are we going
to tell people?

18:53.697 --> 18:57.136
The same parents,
kids are gonna look alike.

19:00.704 --> 19:03.664
Nick uses his right hand.

19:03.707 --> 19:05.666
So what?

19:05.709 --> 19:08.669
Ethan used his left.

19:08.712 --> 19:11.106
Hon...

19:11.150 --> 19:12.977
he's a baby.

19:13.021 --> 19:14.240
How can you tell?

19:14.283 --> 19:16.242
Because I'm with him
all day.

19:16.285 --> 19:18.287
I know.

19:22.857 --> 19:25.860
Maybe you should talk
to someone.

19:27.731 --> 19:30.908
No, I-- I can't talk
to anybody about this.

19:30.952 --> 19:33.694
I don't mean about this.

19:33.737 --> 19:36.784
I mean...
about how you're feeling.

19:39.526 --> 19:42.529
Don't diminish
what I'm feeling, John.

19:43.747 --> 19:45.706
I'm not, okay?

19:45.749 --> 19:48.535
I'm sorry.

19:48.578 --> 19:51.538
Hey.

19:51.581 --> 19:54.236
I just hate seeing you
like this.

19:54.280 --> 19:57.283
I was lost, Selene.

19:58.762 --> 20:00.721
And you pulled me back.

20:00.764 --> 20:03.767
You saved my life.

20:06.509 --> 20:09.686
There's nothing in the world
I wouldn't do for you.

20:09.730 --> 20:11.775
Or Nick.

20:13.821 --> 20:16.215
I love you.

20:16.258 --> 20:19.218
I love Nick.

20:19.261 --> 20:21.220
Selene:
I was in the supermarket
the other day

20:21.263 --> 20:23.222
and there was this piece
of fruit

20:23.265 --> 20:27.226
that had fallen off the stand

20:27.269 --> 20:31.230
and it was just there
on the floor all by itself

20:31.273 --> 20:34.233
and I started to cry.

20:35.930 --> 20:37.888
I don't know, there was just
something about it

20:37.932 --> 20:40.282
that was incredibly sad.

20:40.326 --> 20:43.285
What do you think it was
that made you cry?

20:43.329 --> 20:45.896
I don't know.

20:45.940 --> 20:48.943
I mean, I guess I do know.

20:51.641 --> 20:53.600
But I can't talk about it.

20:53.643 --> 20:56.255
Okay.

20:57.343 --> 21:00.520
How are things with John?

21:01.564 --> 21:04.088
Things with John are good.

21:05.133 --> 21:06.917
I got home from the market

21:06.961 --> 21:09.964
and John was there
and he was great.

21:10.007 --> 21:13.359
I promise
I will man the fort 24-7.

21:13.402 --> 21:17.406
He really works hard
to make me feel better.

21:18.712 --> 21:20.670
He's happy.

21:20.714 --> 21:22.672
He seems happy.

21:22.716 --> 21:25.719
He acts happy.

21:29.592 --> 21:34.336
The other day I looked through a box of Ethan's stuff.

21:34.380 --> 21:39.036
I found his baby teeth
and I took them to the park.

21:39.080 --> 21:40.560
I don't even know why.

21:40.603 --> 21:43.563
I guess I just wanted him
close to me.

21:43.606 --> 21:46.000
Jeannie:
Hey, girl.

21:46.043 --> 21:48.524
How've you been?

21:48.568 --> 21:51.527
Let me ask you something.

21:51.571 --> 21:54.313
Do you think Nick
looks like Ethan?

21:57.054 --> 22:01.624
Well, um... no.

22:01.668 --> 22:04.671
I don't.

22:13.506 --> 22:15.986
Selene: You know when you walk
into a spider web

22:16.030 --> 22:19.729
and you freak out and you're
pulling it off of you,

22:19.773 --> 22:22.123
but it's so thin and silky?

22:22.166 --> 22:23.690
And you can't feel it anymore,

22:23.733 --> 22:27.258
but you know it's all over
your body.

22:27.302 --> 22:29.304
I feel like that.

22:29.348 --> 22:31.567
But there's no web.

22:31.611 --> 22:34.614
No spider.

22:34.657 --> 22:37.486
It's Nick.

22:52.849 --> 22:54.285
John!

22:54.329 --> 22:56.331
What are you doing?

22:59.378 --> 23:01.162
Oh, God.

23:01.205 --> 23:03.425
John, his diaper
is soaking wet.

23:06.602 --> 23:11.346
I need to know
what he's doing.

23:11.390 --> 23:14.436
I need to know what he's doing
when I'm not there.

23:17.134 --> 23:21.138
Coates:
Who are you talking about,
John or Nick?

23:24.794 --> 23:27.493
Selene:
Everything is like something.

23:29.538 --> 23:31.758
I said it's like a spider web.

23:33.803 --> 23:35.762
But it's not.

23:35.805 --> 23:39.330
It's...

23:44.771 --> 23:47.164
John:
Your body has changed
since carrying Ethan.

23:47.208 --> 23:50.298
Environmental conditions
play a major factor

23:50.341 --> 23:52.343
- in the development
of the baby.
- Oh, God, bullshit!

23:55.999 --> 23:59.002
I just want to know
if they're the same person.

24:06.009 --> 24:07.446
They are.

24:07.489 --> 24:09.839
How do you know?

24:09.883 --> 24:13.843
Because Shepard tested
the blood, the hair--

24:13.887 --> 24:15.497
I don't believe him, John.

24:15.541 --> 24:18.500
He's got his fingerprints.

24:26.595 --> 24:28.597
You have Ethan's
fingerprints?

24:30.599 --> 24:33.210
I wanna see.

24:33.254 --> 24:36.213
I gave Shepard everything
from the crime scene.

24:36.257 --> 24:39.216
I don't have them,
he has them.

24:41.784 --> 24:44.091
You know something's wrong.

24:46.136 --> 24:49.531
You act happy and pretend
that everything is normal,

24:49.575 --> 24:52.360
but I've seen the way
you look at Nick.

24:52.403 --> 24:54.928
You spend every day and night
in your office

24:54.971 --> 24:56.538
because you don't wanna admit

24:56.582 --> 24:59.541
what's really going on
in our lives.

24:59.585 --> 25:01.717
You know.

25:01.761 --> 25:03.937
I know you know.

25:08.028 --> 25:10.030
What do I know?

25:12.380 --> 25:14.382
That Nick is not our son.

25:21.520 --> 25:23.478
Then who is he?

26:01.560 --> 26:03.562
Oh.

27:18.462 --> 27:20.464
After we made our agreement,

27:20.508 --> 27:23.467
John gave me the sample.

27:23.511 --> 27:28.081
But very quickly
I knew it wasn't your son.

27:28.124 --> 27:31.084
But he gave me a choice:

27:31.127 --> 27:33.695
you can work with this sample,

27:33.739 --> 27:37.220
you can clone this sample,

27:37.264 --> 27:40.049
or you can walk away.

27:40.093 --> 27:43.879
He assured me that he would
produce the true donor

27:43.923 --> 27:46.534
of the sample at a later date,

27:46.577 --> 27:50.146
and he said that he would
explain everything to you

27:50.190 --> 27:53.106
and that you would
be okay with it.

27:53.149 --> 27:55.151
He promised me that.

27:55.195 --> 27:57.763
I had to believe him.

27:57.806 --> 28:00.766
I needed to believe him.

28:00.809 --> 28:03.769
This work...

28:03.812 --> 28:06.685
I felt it had to be done.

28:07.729 --> 28:10.297
We were never gonna get Ethan.

28:10.340 --> 28:13.343
At the very least,
we could get the killer.

28:21.221 --> 28:22.875
What is--
What is this?

28:22.918 --> 28:24.920
This is Nick.

28:24.964 --> 28:28.402
And this is a man
that John fired.

28:30.143 --> 28:31.797
This is John's uncle.

28:31.840 --> 28:34.843
He was caught embezzling,
stealing from the company.

28:36.627 --> 28:38.499
He's comparing
facial features

28:38.542 --> 28:41.197
between Nick and all
of these people.

28:41.241 --> 28:42.677
John didn't lie to you

28:42.721 --> 28:45.506
when he said the sample came
from the crime scene.

28:45.549 --> 28:48.901
But it wasn't Ethan's DNA.

28:48.944 --> 28:51.512
It's the killer's DNA.

28:51.555 --> 28:55.908
My son, the boy you put
in my body,

28:55.951 --> 28:58.867
will reveal who killed Ethan.

28:58.911 --> 29:03.089
The face of my baby
is the face

29:03.132 --> 29:05.134
of the man
who killed Ethan.

29:09.051 --> 29:10.879
You pushed me into it.

29:14.578 --> 29:17.668
Selene:
My father's picture was
in your files.

29:20.541 --> 29:24.980
Do you think
my father did this?

29:25.024 --> 29:27.591
Am I married to a man

29:27.635 --> 29:30.812
who thinks that my father
could murder his own grandson?

29:32.858 --> 29:35.817
Are you so weak

29:35.861 --> 29:39.473
that you have to believe
there was a reason?

29:39.516 --> 29:42.519
There's never any reason, John.

29:47.916 --> 29:51.311
Ethan's death was
not something

29:51.354 --> 29:54.314
that was natural
or unnatural.

29:54.357 --> 29:58.361
It was just something
that happened.

30:04.715 --> 30:07.718
But Nick...

30:12.158 --> 30:15.161
what is he?

30:17.337 --> 30:21.341
What you did was unnatural,
John.

30:22.342 --> 30:25.301
And he...

30:25.345 --> 30:28.522
he is not natural.

32:46.877 --> 32:49.880
Mr. and Mrs. Ives.

32:49.924 --> 32:53.406
My name is Dean Ruster.

32:53.449 --> 32:57.627
I'm the man
who murdered your son.

33:00.674 --> 33:03.677
Nothing I can ever do
can set things right.

33:06.636 --> 33:08.595
I'm writing this letter
in an attempt

33:08.638 --> 33:11.032
to make amends to both of you

33:11.076 --> 33:14.862
and to allow you some peace.

33:19.867 --> 33:23.436
What I want you to know is
that I've made the decision

33:23.479 --> 33:27.483
to turn myself into the police
and accept the punishment.

33:35.361 --> 33:38.755
Part of the process
of making amends is
to ask for forgiveness

33:38.799 --> 33:41.802
but what I've done is
beyond forgiveness.

33:43.847 --> 33:46.415
I could try and explain
who I was

33:46.459 --> 33:48.591
and where I was in my life
back then,

33:48.635 --> 33:52.030
but I know that there could
never ever be any excuse

33:52.073 --> 33:55.033
for what I've done.

34:00.299 --> 34:02.562
I know I'll never get a chance
to speak to you in person,

34:02.605 --> 34:06.479
so this is my only chance
to speak to you directly.

34:06.522 --> 34:09.960
I hope that knowing the truth about what happened to your son

34:10.004 --> 34:13.964
and knowing that the man
who did it will be punished

34:14.007 --> 34:17.793
will bring some kind of peace.

34:18.839 --> 34:21.101
God bless.

35:45.360 --> 35:47.536
Nick!

35:47.580 --> 35:50.583
Nick, now!

36:19.351 --> 36:21.309
Man: God grant me the serenity

36:21.353 --> 36:23.311
to accept the things
I cannot change.

36:23.355 --> 36:25.748
Courage to change
the things I can

36:25.792 --> 36:27.576
and wisdom to know
the difference.

36:27.620 --> 36:31.101
All: Keep coming back,
it works if you work it.

36:47.727 --> 36:51.383
Woman:
This is West 8th Street,
New York Aquarium.

36:51.426 --> 36:53.820
Transfer is available
to the Q train.

37:03.960 --> 37:06.876
You expecting a phone call
or something?

37:08.922 --> 37:11.490
Put the fucking phone away.

37:51.530 --> 37:53.532
You're-- you're a cop.

37:53.575 --> 37:56.274
No.

37:58.319 --> 38:00.365
A lawyer?

38:00.408 --> 38:02.367
Oh, God, no.

38:02.410 --> 38:05.370
No, I'm a friend of Mrs. Ives.

38:05.413 --> 38:08.242
Dean.

38:08.286 --> 38:10.636
I know who you are.

38:10.679 --> 38:14.683
And I-- I know
what you've done.

38:20.123 --> 38:21.473
The Ives have a son.

38:21.516 --> 38:24.476
Nick. He's gonna
be 12 years old.

38:24.519 --> 38:26.695
And as crazy
as it sounds...

39:54.261 --> 39:56.219
How old are you, Dean?

39:56.263 --> 39:57.525
35.

39:57.569 --> 40:01.181
Have you ever had any
major illnesses?

40:01.224 --> 40:02.791
No.

40:02.835 --> 40:04.053
Surgeries?

40:04.097 --> 40:06.055
No.

40:06.099 --> 40:08.275
Have you broken
any bones?

40:08.318 --> 40:11.278
Yes. Many.

40:11.321 --> 40:13.715
Siblings?

40:13.759 --> 40:16.718
Dean?

40:16.762 --> 40:19.721
Are you okay?

40:19.765 --> 40:22.420
Have some juice.

40:40.394 --> 40:42.352
Are you good?

40:42.396 --> 40:44.398
Yeah, I'm fine.

40:48.010 --> 40:50.535
Are you troubled
by feelings of guilt?

40:50.578 --> 40:52.275
No.

40:52.319 --> 40:55.496
Have you ever experienced
a deep emotional connection

40:55.540 --> 40:57.498
with another person?

40:57.542 --> 40:59.500
No.

40:59.544 --> 41:01.502
Yes.

41:01.546 --> 41:04.549
Uh, not in the way
you're asking.

41:06.202 --> 41:08.640
The boy-- is-- is there
something wrong with the boy?

41:09.684 --> 41:11.860
The boy's fine.

41:11.904 --> 41:14.036
So, these-- these questions--

41:14.080 --> 41:16.778
Is this, um-- Is this a nature
nurture thing?

41:16.822 --> 41:19.825
It's not--
It's not one thing.

41:21.827 --> 41:23.785
May I go on?

41:23.829 --> 41:26.396
Yeah.

41:26.440 --> 41:29.791
Do you feel the world
exists solely for you?

41:29.835 --> 41:32.794
Hmm.

41:32.838 --> 41:35.797
I remember...

41:35.841 --> 41:37.538
going to bed at night

41:37.582 --> 41:41.542
and I knew that the world
collapsed when I was asleep.

41:43.588 --> 41:46.199
And then when I woke up,

41:46.242 --> 41:50.203
it had reassembled itself.

41:50.246 --> 41:51.639
What's going on here?

41:51.683 --> 41:52.988
What do you mean?

41:53.032 --> 41:55.991
This isn't--

41:56.035 --> 41:58.603
This is not what I expected.

41:58.646 --> 42:01.475
I was...

42:01.519 --> 42:03.477
I thought I'd be crucified,

42:03.521 --> 42:07.525
but instead I'm getting a
blood test, orange juice.

42:11.006 --> 42:13.966
There's a part of me
that welcomes it.

42:14.009 --> 42:16.490
The survival part,

42:16.534 --> 42:19.362
but the--
the moral part...

42:21.408 --> 42:25.368
I want to see him.

42:25.412 --> 42:27.675
You seem like
a reasonable guy, Dean,

42:27.719 --> 42:31.200
but you're gonna have to wait.

42:35.030 --> 42:36.989
Yeah.

44:41.548 --> 44:42.549
Nick.

44:45.683 --> 44:47.685
Nick.

44:55.910 --> 44:57.912
Mom?

44:57.956 --> 45:00.001
Hey.

45:18.411 --> 45:21.414
Mom, what are you doing?

45:33.034 --> 45:36.298
You're freaking me out, mom.

45:48.658 --> 45:51.009
I'm gonna go to bed now.

46:25.260 --> 46:26.522
Dean: This is Dean.

46:26.566 --> 46:27.828
Leave a message.

46:31.179 --> 46:34.139
This is Selene Ives.

46:34.182 --> 46:37.142
I'd like to come
and talk to you.

46:37.185 --> 46:39.709
Give me a call back
with your address.

47:00.121 --> 47:01.514
None for you?

47:01.557 --> 47:03.559
Oh, not now.

47:27.845 --> 47:29.847
This is very good.

47:51.259 --> 47:54.262
I've been trying
to locate the...

47:57.265 --> 48:00.268
the nanny's family.

48:03.793 --> 48:06.796
I... I want to speak
with them.

48:08.581 --> 48:12.585
But...
well, I can't find anything.

48:14.979 --> 48:17.982
She didn't have any family.

48:19.026 --> 48:20.985
No kids.

48:21.028 --> 48:23.030
Her parents were both dead.

48:26.207 --> 48:29.167
She divorced her husband
and moved from Guatemala.

48:29.210 --> 48:31.212
She had no one.

48:41.222 --> 48:43.181
What was her name?

48:43.224 --> 48:45.226
Maria.

48:46.924 --> 48:49.883
We buried her.

48:49.927 --> 48:52.190
I contacted some of her friends
from Guatemala,

48:52.233 --> 48:54.844
but no one came.

48:54.888 --> 48:56.890
It was just us.

49:49.377 --> 49:51.814
What?

50:06.003 --> 50:08.266
Ah! Ow.

50:32.594 --> 50:36.424
Selene:
John wanted to hate Nick.

50:36.468 --> 50:40.211
But he was so helpless
and so small,

50:40.254 --> 50:42.387
so we raised Nick
as our own.

50:43.562 --> 50:46.478
Dean:
What's he like?

50:46.521 --> 50:49.176
Nick?

50:49.220 --> 50:50.656
Selene:
Nick doesn't have that scar.

50:56.140 --> 50:58.055
What's it from?

50:59.360 --> 51:00.970
Blood brothers.

51:01.014 --> 51:03.190
Are you still in touch
with your blood brother?

51:03.234 --> 51:05.018
No.

51:06.715 --> 51:10.067
There was more blood
there than brother.

51:15.202 --> 51:20.816
Five years ago,
I first decided
to contact you,

51:20.860 --> 51:23.167
and by the grace of God...

51:24.951 --> 51:27.649
and whatever moral sense
I still had,

51:27.693 --> 51:31.392
I knew I had to confess.

51:31.436 --> 51:34.526
To give you closure.

51:34.569 --> 51:37.485
When I finally
found you and John...

51:39.661 --> 51:41.663
I couldn't.

51:44.144 --> 51:46.103
I was a coward.

51:49.584 --> 51:54.023
I felt so alone
back then.

51:54.067 --> 51:56.287
I was a different person.

51:58.854 --> 52:01.944
No.
It was me.

52:04.860 --> 52:07.950
I did these things.

52:07.994 --> 52:11.215
To you.
To your husband.

52:11.258 --> 52:14.218
To your nanny.

52:14.261 --> 52:16.524
To your son.

52:24.097 --> 52:25.620
Tell me.

52:25.664 --> 52:28.145
I need to know.

52:35.891 --> 52:38.807
That day...

52:38.851 --> 52:42.507
I'd fallen asleep
on a train.

52:42.550 --> 52:46.859
And I woke
in Coney Island.

52:46.902 --> 52:51.603
It was so hot,
I swam in the ocean.

52:51.646 --> 52:53.213
Dried out in the sun.

52:55.041 --> 52:58.827
Then I was back
on the train.

52:58.871 --> 53:02.570
And then
I was somewhere else.

53:02.614 --> 53:06.183
The streets were tree-lined,
big houses.

53:17.542 --> 53:20.588
She woke up
and saw me standing there.

53:23.896 --> 53:26.725
She asked what I wanted.

53:26.768 --> 53:29.554
And-- and I hit her.

53:31.512 --> 53:34.820
I don't know
what I wanted.

53:34.863 --> 53:39.303
I wasn't there
'cause I wanted anything.

53:39.346 --> 53:44.308
But once I started,
I couldn't stop.

53:47.485 --> 53:49.617
And then I saw him.

53:49.661 --> 53:51.880
He just stood there.

53:56.145 --> 53:59.932
He closed the door behind him,
but it wasn't locked.

54:06.243 --> 54:08.245
Sorry.

54:11.160 --> 54:13.946
Tell me.

54:13.989 --> 54:15.730
I need to hear it.

54:23.085 --> 54:26.915
He was crying, but calm.

54:29.222 --> 54:33.618
It was as if he had accepted
what was happening.

54:33.661 --> 54:37.230
So I walked him
down the hall

54:37.274 --> 54:40.929
and he tried to bite me.

54:40.973 --> 54:43.192
He didn't hurt me.

54:46.631 --> 54:49.590
I threw him down
and he hit his head

54:49.634 --> 54:52.680
on the corner
of the television stand.

54:56.597 --> 55:01.036
He tried to crawl away,
but his--

55:01.080 --> 55:06.085
he couldn't get
his arms and legs to work
the way that he wanted.

55:08.653 --> 55:12.396
And then he stopped moving.

55:12.439 --> 55:14.615
And then
he stopped breathing.

55:18.619 --> 55:22.971
I looked around the house.
I was there, so I figured
I should steal something.

55:23.015 --> 55:24.408
But...

55:27.193 --> 55:29.804
there was nothing for me.

55:32.546 --> 55:35.375
I couldn't remember everything
that had happened, but...

55:39.553 --> 55:41.207
I felt it.

55:49.737 --> 55:52.087
I'm turning myself in.

55:55.047 --> 55:57.223
I shoulda done it long ago.

56:22.944 --> 56:24.206
John:
Hey, it's getting late.

56:24.250 --> 56:25.730
I haven't heard from you
all night.

56:25.773 --> 56:27.732
Give me a ring, okay?

56:31.475 --> 56:34.826
All right,
it's bedtime, bud.

56:34.869 --> 56:36.436
Nick.

56:36.480 --> 56:39.396
Yeah?

56:43.051 --> 56:46.141
How long's it take
before you finish that thing?

56:46.185 --> 56:48.405
However long it takes.

56:52.321 --> 56:54.236
All right, get to bed.

56:54.280 --> 56:57.544
One second.

57:03.855 --> 57:06.335
Nick, now. Go.

57:26.312 --> 57:31.012
- Hey.
- Selene: Hey.

57:31.056 --> 57:32.710
How's Jeannie?

57:34.842 --> 57:38.324
She's fine.
She's good.

57:42.720 --> 57:46.288
It's late. I left you
a couple messages.

57:49.466 --> 57:51.380
I left my phone
in the car.

57:51.424 --> 57:53.861
I'm gonna
take a shower.

57:53.905 --> 57:54.906
Hey.

57:57.648 --> 58:00.259
Come here.

58:00.302 --> 58:02.740
John, I'm so tired.

58:02.783 --> 58:04.785
Come here.

58:30.028 --> 58:32.726
I miss you.

58:38.384 --> 58:40.125
I love you.

58:45.260 --> 58:47.567
I love you.

59:02.843 --> 59:05.150
I'm gonna go take a shower.

01:00:51.169 --> 01:00:53.519
Woman:
...what might happen
in our lives,

01:00:53.562 --> 01:00:55.913
we'll be able to move closer
to the idea

01:00:55.956 --> 01:00:58.263
we've been trying to prove.

01:01:23.897 --> 01:01:26.378
...conscious contact with God,

01:01:26.421 --> 01:01:29.947
with His grace,
wisdom, and love.

01:01:29.990 --> 01:01:34.691
And always remember that
meditation is in reality...

01:03:00.646 --> 01:03:04.128
Adult Nick:
Father, it's been
a long time,

01:03:04.171 --> 01:03:08.436
and I miss you.

01:03:08.480 --> 01:03:12.876
I wonder how you are,
where you are,

01:03:12.919 --> 01:03:14.921
if I'll ever see you again.

01:03:19.230 --> 01:03:22.842
I bought land
in the mountains.

01:03:22.886 --> 01:03:27.542
Acres and acres
of empty canvas.

01:03:32.678 --> 01:03:37.726
But I've been staring so long
into the forest...

01:03:37.770 --> 01:03:43.080
I feel like the forest
has started to stare
back into me.

01:04:40.746 --> 01:04:42.922
Man: Hey!

01:04:52.279 --> 01:04:53.541
Hey!

01:05:00.418 --> 01:05:02.420
Hey!

01:05:11.603 --> 01:05:13.300
Hey!

01:05:34.887 --> 01:05:38.760
Hey.

01:05:38.804 --> 01:05:41.633
Hey, asshole!

01:05:48.988 --> 01:05:50.947
Hey!

01:06:30.856 --> 01:06:32.597
Hey.

01:06:37.471 --> 01:06:39.647
Holy shit, man.

01:06:45.784 --> 01:06:48.439
Hey.

01:06:48.482 --> 01:06:50.528
Did you think that I was
just gonna give up?

01:06:58.275 --> 01:06:59.798
What the hell's
going on here?

01:07:14.856 --> 01:07:17.903
There's a hole
in my floor.

01:07:17.946 --> 01:07:20.123
Einhorn won't fix it.

01:07:22.864 --> 01:07:26.346
Why are you telling me?

01:07:26.390 --> 01:07:28.740
Well, you own the land.

01:07:28.783 --> 01:07:30.742
And my house.

01:07:35.399 --> 01:07:37.270
Talk to Einhorn.

01:07:45.148 --> 01:07:47.237
You're deaf.

01:07:55.158 --> 01:07:58.117
Pleasure.

01:08:23.316 --> 01:08:25.318
You put these up?

01:08:29.453 --> 01:08:30.889
Yes.

01:08:30.932 --> 01:08:33.587
Why?

01:08:33.631 --> 01:08:35.981
Boredom.

01:08:36.024 --> 01:08:39.898
I guess I wanted to make it
more difficult to walk
around a familiar space.

01:08:44.555 --> 01:08:46.426
Where's the hole?

01:08:59.309 --> 01:09:04.009
These columns go
all the way through
the floor to the ground?

01:09:04.051 --> 01:09:05.532
You tried to put
a column there.

01:09:05.576 --> 01:09:07.491
That's why Einhorn
wouldn't fix it.

01:09:15.455 --> 01:09:17.457
I'll see what I can do.

01:09:18.676 --> 01:09:20.720
Thanks for stopping by.

01:09:31.036 --> 01:09:34.212
Adult Nick:
Father, you live inside me.

01:09:34.256 --> 01:09:37.346
The past lives inside me.

01:09:37.390 --> 01:09:41.176
My body existed
before I was born.

01:09:41.220 --> 01:09:45.398
It walked through a timeline
I wasn't part of.

01:09:45.442 --> 01:09:48.880
The past is imprinted
in my DNA.

01:10:38.799 --> 01:10:43.543
This body killed
a woman and a child.

01:10:43.587 --> 01:10:46.242
I was raised by a man
who murdered his wife

01:10:46.285 --> 01:10:49.462
and then killed himself.

01:10:49.506 --> 01:10:51.943
I'm an abomination.

01:12:18.508 --> 01:12:22.381
A riverfront property
runs along the front
of all these cabins.

01:12:22.425 --> 01:12:23.774
It's just
a little clearing.

01:12:23.817 --> 01:12:26.254
Now, all of 'em.
And this, this is a road.

01:12:26.298 --> 01:12:28.996
This is the end
of the property up here.

01:12:29.040 --> 01:12:32.173
And there's a real nice
building site way up here.

01:12:32.217 --> 01:12:35.046
- Mm.
- And it overlooks
the whole valley.

01:12:35.089 --> 01:12:37.048
- And then there's--
- Hey, boys.

01:12:47.014 --> 01:12:49.147
Wow.

01:12:49.190 --> 01:12:51.802
You build this place
yourself?

01:12:51.845 --> 01:12:54.892
With the trees
that were standing here.

01:12:54.935 --> 01:12:56.894
I'll take a look.

01:13:00.201 --> 01:13:03.074
Do you want to look
at a bigger chunk
of property here?

01:13:03.117 --> 01:13:05.598
Yeah.

01:13:05.642 --> 01:13:07.383
Through here.

01:13:07.426 --> 01:13:10.168
And then there's another chunk
up here on this map here.

01:13:10.211 --> 01:13:12.910
But you could be
something else.

01:13:12.953 --> 01:13:16.435
Like, it's some gorgeous
pieces of property here.

01:13:24.617 --> 01:13:26.750
Jesus Murphy.
You have a lot of books.

01:13:26.793 --> 01:13:28.839
Mm.

01:13:31.494 --> 01:13:33.626
Why don't you
give me one?

01:13:36.586 --> 01:13:38.501
Uh...

01:13:48.249 --> 01:13:50.774
What's this?

01:13:50.817 --> 01:13:54.821
When Benjamin was writing,
about 100 years ago,

01:13:54.865 --> 01:13:59.043
there was a massive jump
in the speed and accuracy

01:13:59.086 --> 01:14:00.871
of mass reproduction.

01:14:00.914 --> 01:14:03.351
He believed this
changed the context

01:14:03.395 --> 01:14:07.486
in which all art
could be understood.

01:14:07.530 --> 01:14:09.314
How?

01:14:09.357 --> 01:14:13.274
The authenticity
of a work of reproduction.

01:14:13.318 --> 01:14:16.452
If the copy is the same
as the original,

01:14:16.495 --> 01:14:18.584
it's just as authentic.

01:14:18.628 --> 01:14:24.590
But an exact copy
is different in one
very important respect.

01:14:26.462 --> 01:14:28.420
Time.

01:14:28.464 --> 01:14:31.510
One was created
after the other.

01:14:31.554 --> 01:14:33.991
So what?

01:14:34.034 --> 01:14:37.429
If anything, that makes
the copy more interesting.

01:14:37.473 --> 01:14:39.562
How do you figure?

01:14:39.605 --> 01:14:42.695
Well, it has all the same
qualities as the original,
but it's...

01:14:42.739 --> 01:14:44.784
something different.

01:14:44.828 --> 01:14:47.483
But you just said
they're indistinguishable.

01:14:47.526 --> 01:14:49.920
- Yes, but--
- So, why do you now say--

01:14:49.963 --> 01:14:51.617
Wait, wait. Wait.

01:14:53.880 --> 01:14:58.450
If an object could possess
some sort of historical quality,

01:14:58.494 --> 01:15:00.626
does the bullet that
killed Abraham Lincoln

01:15:00.670 --> 01:15:03.977
have some sort
of mystical quality?

01:15:04.021 --> 01:15:06.023
Something that the thousands
of other identical bullets

01:15:06.066 --> 01:15:08.982
that weren't used
don't have?

01:15:09.026 --> 01:15:14.553
Isn't intentionality
more important than appearance?

01:15:14.597 --> 01:15:18.557
No, the people interpret it
the way they choose.

01:15:18.601 --> 01:15:20.341
A guy living in a cave.

01:15:20.385 --> 01:15:23.388
He sees "The Last Supper"
for the first time.

01:15:23.431 --> 01:15:28.872
Now, he might just see
a bunch of people sitting
at a dinner table.

01:15:28.915 --> 01:15:32.789
But the ideas and the symbols
are still there.

01:15:32.832 --> 01:15:34.921
No, they're
shape and color.

01:15:34.965 --> 01:15:39.883
But it's the people
that give the thing meaning.

01:15:45.018 --> 01:15:46.629
What?

01:15:46.672 --> 01:15:48.413
It's just funny
coming from a guy

01:15:48.456 --> 01:15:51.764
that's been living out here
for, like, a thousand years.

01:15:51.808 --> 01:15:53.723
Let me as you something.

01:15:53.766 --> 01:15:59.206
If you could make
an exact reproduction
of yourself,

01:15:59.250 --> 01:16:00.381
would you?

01:16:00.425 --> 01:16:04.168
Sure.

01:16:04.211 --> 01:16:06.257
What would you do with it?

01:16:07.954 --> 01:16:09.782
I'd fuck it.

01:16:11.871 --> 01:16:14.352
No, wait.

01:16:14.395 --> 01:16:18.399
I'd fuck it,
I'd cook it,

01:16:18.443 --> 01:16:20.619
I'd kill it,
and eat it.

01:16:32.370 --> 01:16:35.416
Are you lonely?

01:16:35.460 --> 01:16:39.116
- Hmm?
- Are you lonely?

01:16:39.159 --> 01:16:40.683
You get used to it.

01:16:51.041 --> 01:16:53.086
I gotta go.

01:16:53.130 --> 01:16:57.874
No.

01:16:57.917 --> 01:17:00.180
What?

01:17:01.704 --> 01:17:03.706
Yeah, go ahead.

01:17:03.749 --> 01:17:05.751
I'll come by
your place tomorrow.

01:17:26.685 --> 01:17:32.386
Adult Nick:
Father, I remember
the day at the carousel.

01:17:32.430 --> 01:17:34.432
John brought me there
because when I was younger,

01:17:34.475 --> 01:17:38.392
that was our favorite place.

01:17:38.436 --> 01:17:43.659
I remember stirrings
of nostalgia so bad
my stomach ached.

01:17:43.702 --> 01:17:47.488
I remember in that moment,
wanting to go back

01:17:47.532 --> 01:17:49.708
to when I was even younger,

01:17:49.752 --> 01:17:53.190
back to waking up
in the back seat of the car

01:17:53.233 --> 01:17:57.107
when John would
carry me into the house.

01:17:57.150 --> 01:18:01.198
I try to hold onto memories,
but they fade.

01:18:01.241 --> 01:18:02.808
- Hmm.
- Ahem.

01:18:02.852 --> 01:18:04.375
I'd forgotten
what it feels like

01:18:04.418 --> 01:18:06.638
to know another person
is in the next room.

01:19:06.002 --> 01:19:07.743
No music.

01:21:40.896 --> 01:21:43.333
Man's voice:
Nick?

01:22:06.617 --> 01:22:10.490
I know you.
I remember you.

01:22:10.534 --> 01:22:13.972
Well, I guess you would.

01:22:14.016 --> 01:22:17.976
Of course, I've only met
you before as a child.

01:22:18.020 --> 01:22:19.195
Here, that is.

01:22:19.238 --> 01:22:20.979
Where you're from, I--

01:22:21.023 --> 01:22:23.677
- Where I'm from?
- Yeah.

01:22:23.721 --> 01:22:25.679
Where you're from.

01:22:25.723 --> 01:22:28.030
What year is it?

01:22:28.073 --> 01:22:30.771
- What?
- Humor me.

01:22:30.815 --> 01:22:33.687
Uh, it's 2033.

01:22:33.731 --> 01:22:36.125
2033.

01:22:36.168 --> 01:22:37.691
Maybe.

01:22:37.735 --> 01:22:39.476
Maybe not.

01:22:39.519 --> 01:22:44.829
What if it's 300 years
past that?

01:22:44.872 --> 01:22:47.745
What if you're not
number two, Nick?

01:22:47.788 --> 01:22:51.792
But version 10
or version 20?

01:22:53.229 --> 01:22:55.753
Your friend,

01:22:55.796 --> 01:22:59.713
he looks familiar,
doesn't he?

01:22:59.757 --> 01:23:03.195
You think
he's an original?

01:23:03.239 --> 01:23:04.762
Original what?

01:23:04.805 --> 01:23:09.810
If you're number 20, eh,

01:23:09.854 --> 01:23:11.290
what if he's number 18?

01:23:11.334 --> 01:23:14.772
And you two have been
doing this same dance,

01:23:14.815 --> 01:23:19.168
with minor variations,
for a very long time?

01:24:17.617 --> 01:24:22.796
John's voice:
I took Nick out of school
early today.

01:24:22.840 --> 01:24:25.756
Wanted to take him
somewhere special.

01:24:25.799 --> 01:24:30.978
When I asked him,
he told me he wanted to go
to the carousel in Brooklyn.

01:24:31.022 --> 01:24:34.504
Remember when we
used to take him there?

01:24:34.547 --> 01:24:37.637
Those are memories
I'll cherish forever.

01:24:37.681 --> 01:24:41.467
I wonder if the carousel
is also Dean's favorite place.

01:24:41.511 --> 01:24:44.949
I wonder how
deep the similarities
run between them.

01:24:49.606 --> 01:24:52.130
I guess you know
the answer to that.

01:24:53.958 --> 01:24:56.178
- Selene: Is he here?
- Dean: No.

01:25:02.314 --> 01:25:04.708
John's voice:
I love you very much.

01:25:04.751 --> 01:25:09.060
- And I love Nick very much.

01:25:09.104 --> 01:25:12.498
John? John!

01:25:47.707 --> 01:25:49.492
Nick.

01:25:55.106 --> 01:25:56.890
I love you, all right?

01:26:10.643 --> 01:26:13.733
- Wanna go out there?
- Sure.

01:26:15.909 --> 01:26:17.694
- Coming?
- Yeah.

01:26:17.737 --> 01:26:19.086
Yeah, I'll swim
out there in a bit.

01:28:24.908 --> 01:28:30.217
Adult Nick:
Father, why did you take me
in and raise me as your own?

01:28:30.261 --> 01:28:33.351
Was it penance?

01:28:33.395 --> 01:28:36.659
What did it feel
like to raise...

01:28:36.702 --> 01:28:40.358
yourself?

01:28:40.402 --> 01:28:46.146
How did the letter
you wrote to John and Selene
end up at my door?

01:28:46.190 --> 01:28:48.714
Who put it there?

01:28:48.758 --> 01:28:50.977
Did he?

01:28:51.021 --> 01:28:53.893
Is he a copy of John?

01:28:53.937 --> 01:28:56.200
I don't understand.

01:28:56.243 --> 01:29:00.639
Do you think you were crazy
when you killed his boy?

01:29:00.683 --> 01:29:05.905
Was it you who killed him,
or was it a copy?

01:29:05.949 --> 01:29:11.520
Am I a copy of you or
a copy of a copy of a copy?

01:29:13.130 --> 01:29:14.914
Maybe I killed the boy.

01:29:18.788 --> 01:29:21.443
I feel like I'm going crazy.

01:29:24.184 --> 01:29:25.664
I need to know.

01:29:25.708 --> 01:29:30.582
I need to find proof
of...of what?

01:29:34.281 --> 01:29:35.935
Did you put the--

01:29:35.979 --> 01:29:38.677
did you put that letter
under my door?

01:29:40.462 --> 01:29:42.289
Did you put that letter
under my door?

01:29:42.333 --> 01:29:44.422
Did you-- no, no!

01:29:44.466 --> 01:29:46.642
No! No! No!

01:29:46.685 --> 01:29:49.601
I'm sorry.
I'm-- I'm sorry, no!

01:29:49.645 --> 01:29:53.518
Oh, no, don't do it!

01:29:53.562 --> 01:29:55.868
I'm sorry,
don't make me leave.

01:29:55.912 --> 01:29:57.522
Don't-- no! No!

01:29:57.566 --> 01:29:59.916
Don't make me--
don't-- no.

01:29:59.959 --> 01:30:01.961
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

01:30:02.005 --> 01:30:04.050
- Get out of my house.
- Please.

01:30:04.094 --> 01:30:09.578
- Get out of my house.
- Please. I'm sorry.

01:30:09.621 --> 01:30:14.017
I'm so lonely.
I'm so lonely.

01:30:14.060 --> 01:30:19.588
I can't see you.

01:30:19.631 --> 01:30:22.982
I can't see you.

01:30:27.073 --> 01:30:28.771
Get out.

01:30:30.642 --> 01:30:34.559
Okay.

01:30:34.603 --> 01:30:37.649
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

01:31:55.771 --> 01:31:57.860
Adult Nick:
Father.

01:31:57.903 --> 01:32:01.341
You once told me
that everything is already
in the past.

01:32:01.385 --> 01:32:04.780
And you loved a line
from that old movie.

01:32:04.823 --> 01:32:07.783
"The present is real,
but you're not in it now.

01:32:07.826 --> 01:32:12.701
You're not in it now.
You're not in it now.

01:32:12.744 --> 01:32:15.399
By the time the light
bounces off something

01:32:15.442 --> 01:32:18.358
and into your eyes
it's already in the past."

01:32:18.402 --> 01:32:21.884
Everything we see
is past.

01:32:21.927 --> 01:32:25.409
Everything
has already past.

01:33:30.387 --> 01:33:34.434
But you're not
in it now.

01:33:34.478 --> 01:33:38.308
You're not in it now.

01:33:38.351 --> 01:33:41.354
You're not
in it now.

01:33:41.398 --> 01:33:45.837
You're not in it now.
