01:28.172 --> 01:30.548
# Fall is here
Hear the yell #

01:30.632 --> 01:33.050
# Back to school
Ring the bell #

01:33.135 --> 01:35.720
# Brand-new shoes
Walking blues #

01:35.804 --> 01:37.930
# Climb the fence
Books and pens #

01:38.015 --> 01:41.642
# I can tell that we are
gonna be friends #

01:43.312 --> 01:47.774
# I can tell that we are
gonna be friends #

01:50.903 --> 01:53.279
# Walk with me, Suzy Lee #

01:53.363 --> 01:56.240
# Through the park
and by the tree #

01:56.325 --> 01:58.242
# We will rest upon the ground #

01:58.327 --> 02:00.745
# And look at all
the bugs we found #

02:00.829 --> 02:03.956
# Safely walk to school
without a sound #

02:05.834 --> 02:09.377
# Safely walk to school
without a sound #

02:13.175 --> 02:15.301
# Here we are
no one else #

02:15.385 --> 02:17.678
# We walk to school
all by ourselves #

02:17.763 --> 02:20.306
# There's dirt on our uniforms #

02:20.390 --> 02:22.809
# From chasing
all the ants and worms #

02:22.893 --> 02:26.395
# We clean up
and now it's time to learn #

02:27.981 --> 02:31.150
# We clean up
and now it's time to learn #

02:35.155 --> 02:37.490
# Numbers, letters
Learn to spell #

02:37.574 --> 02:40.034
# Nouns and books
and show-and-tell #

02:40.118 --> 02:42.453
# Playtime
we will throw the ball #

02:42.538 --> 02:44.997
# Back to class
through the hall #

02:45.082 --> 02:48.417
# Teacher marks our height
against the wall #

02:49.920 --> 02:53.172
# Teacher marks our height
against the wall #

02:57.761 --> 03:01.597
# We don't notice
any time pass #

03:02.599 --> 03:05.601
# We don't notice anything #

03:07.104 --> 03:10.898
# We sit side by side
in every class #

03:12.192 --> 03:14.151
# Teacher thinks
that I sound funny #

03:14.236 --> 03:16.529
# But she likes
the way you sing #

03:16.613 --> 03:18.865
# Tonight I'll dream
while I'm in bed #

03:18.949 --> 03:21.534
# When silly thoughts
go through my head #

03:21.618 --> 03:23.828
# About the bugs and alphabet #

03:23.912 --> 03:26.038
# When I wake
tomorrow I'll bet #

03:26.123 --> 03:29.500
# That you and I
will walk together again #

03:31.253 --> 03:34.630
# I can tell that we are
gonna be friends #

03:36.091 --> 03:40.177
# Yes, I can tell that we are
gonna be friends ##

04:19.927 --> 04:22.595
What are you gonna do
today, Napoleon?

04:22.679 --> 04:25.181
Whatever I feel like
I want to do. Gosh!

05:20.737 --> 05:23.030
Your current event, Napoleon.

05:36.545 --> 05:39.755
Last week, Japanese
scientists "explaced"—

05:39.840 --> 05:43.467
placed explosive detonators at
the bottom of Lake Loch Ness...

05:43.552 --> 05:45.594
to blow Nessie
out of the water.

05:51.810 --> 05:54.729
Sir Curt Godfrey
of the Nessie Alliance...

05:54.813 --> 05:57.231
summoned the help of
Scotland's local wizards...

05:57.315 --> 06:01.861
to cast a protective spell over
the lake and its local residents...

06:01.945 --> 06:07.033
and all those who seek for the peaceful
existence of our underwater ally.

06:24.801 --> 06:28.846
Yes. Yes.

06:31.767 --> 06:34.351
Hey, Napoleon, what'd you do
all last summer again?

06:34.436 --> 06:38.272
I told you. I spent it with my
uncle in Alaska hunting wolverines.

06:38.356 --> 06:41.484
- Did you shoot any?
- Yes, like 50 of'em.

06:41.568 --> 06:45.529
They kept tryin' to attack my cousins. What
the heck would you do in a situation like that?

06:45.614 --> 06:50.409
- What kind of gun did you use? - A
frickin' 12-gauge. What do you think?

06:50.494 --> 06:53.037
You think you're funny?
You just watch your step.

06:53.163 --> 06:55.498
But I didn't—

07:01.922 --> 07:05.132
Hey, could I use your guys's
phone for a sec?

07:05.217 --> 07:08.594
- Is there anything wrong?
- I don't feel very good.

07:32.035 --> 07:34.954
- Hi.
- Is Grandma there?

07:35.038 --> 07:37.331
No, she's getting
her hair done.

07:41.711 --> 07:44.255
What do you need? Can you
just go get her for me?

07:44.339 --> 07:47.633
- I'm really busy right now.
- Well, just tell her to come get me.

07:47.759 --> 07:50.719
Why?
'Cause I don't feel good.

07:50.846 --> 07:54.557
Well, have you talked to the school
nurse? No, she doesn't know anything.

07:54.641 --> 07:57.685
- Will you just come get me?
- No.

07:57.769 --> 07:59.687
Well, will you do me
a favor then?

07:59.813 --> 08:02.565
What?
Can you bring me my Chap Stick?

08:02.691 --> 08:05.276
No, Napoleon.
But my lips hurt real bad.

08:05.360 --> 08:09.113
Just borrow some from the school nurse. I
know she has, like, five sticks in her drawer.

08:09.197 --> 08:11.699
I'm not gonna use hers,
you sicko.

08:11.783 --> 08:13.701
See ya.

08:13.785 --> 08:16.745
Idiot!

08:18.248 --> 08:19.999
David Dempke,
please come to the office.

08:20.000 --> 08:21.125
David Dempke,
please come to the office.

08:21.251 --> 08:24.128
David Dempke.
You do understand English?

08:24.212 --> 08:27.882
This isn't that complex. Look,
the cafeteria's down the hall,

08:27.966 --> 08:30.009
to the right and downstairs.

08:31.428 --> 08:33.470
Hey, is that a new kid
or something?

08:33.554 --> 08:35.472
Napoleon, this is Pedro.

08:35.557 --> 08:37.725
Would you mind showing him
where his locker is?

08:37.808 --> 08:39.768
Sure. Come on.

08:44.441 --> 08:48.027
You know, there's, like, a
buttload of gangs at this school.

08:48.111 --> 08:52.156
This one gang kept wanting me to join
'cause I'm pretty good with a bow staff.

08:55.285 --> 08:57.244
Do you ride the bus
to school?

08:57.329 --> 08:59.246
No. I ride my bike.

08:59.331 --> 09:02.416
- What kind of bike do you have?
- It's a Sledgehammer.

09:02.500 --> 09:04.627
Dang!

09:04.711 --> 09:06.587
You got shocks, pegs.

09:06.671 --> 09:08.380
Lucky!

09:10.258 --> 09:13.969
You ever take it off
any sweet jumps?

09:20.018 --> 09:22.519
You got, like,
three feet of air that time.

09:24.689 --> 09:26.690
Can I try it really quick?

09:33.031 --> 09:34.990
Taint!

09:35.075 --> 09:37.409
I love the way...

09:37.494 --> 09:39.536
your sandy hair...

09:39.621 --> 09:42.206
floats in the air.

09:42.290 --> 09:44.917
To me it's like a lullaby.

09:45.001 --> 09:48.963
I'm just flying by,
oh, so high,

09:49.047 --> 09:51.882
like a kite
tied to a stake.

09:55.679 --> 09:58.597
How was school?

09:58.682 --> 10:01.183
The worst day of my life.
What do you think?

10:01.268 --> 10:04.561
- Well, I want you to go see
if Tina wants some of this.

10:08.024 --> 10:10.609
Kip hasn't done
flipping anything today.

10:10.694 --> 10:13.320
Look, tonight me and your-
Kip, listen!

10:13.405 --> 10:17.408
- What?
- Tonight me and your aunt are gonna go visit some friends,

10:17.492 --> 10:19.410
and we're not gonna
be back till tomorrow.

10:19.494 --> 10:23.289
We're gettin' low on steak, so I got Lyle
comin' over tomorrow to take care of it.

10:23.373 --> 10:26.208
- Well, what's there to eat?
- Knock it off, Napoleon.

10:26.293 --> 10:28.252
Make yourself a dang
quesadilla!

10:28.378 --> 10:30.421
Fine!

10:30.505 --> 10:32.464
I'll be back tomorrow.

10:39.055 --> 10:41.307
Stay home and eat all
the freakin' chips, Kip!

10:41.391 --> 10:46.603
Napoleon, don't be jealous that I've
been chatting online with babes all day.

10:46.688 --> 10:50.107
Besides, we both know I'm
training to become a cage fighter.

10:50.191 --> 10:52.860
Since when, Kip? You have the
worst reflexes of all time.

10:52.944 --> 10:55.112
- Try and hit me, Napoleon.
- What?

10:55.196 --> 10:58.157
I said come down here and see
what happens if you try and hit me.

11:01.286 --> 11:03.495
Such an idiot.

11:03.580 --> 11:05.748
Let me see what
your best move is.

11:14.591 --> 11:16.717
I'll go get it.

11:16.801 --> 11:18.802
Geez!

11:25.602 --> 11:27.603
Um, hello.

11:27.687 --> 11:30.481
Would you like to
look like this?

11:34.069 --> 11:35.778
This is a girl.

11:37.447 --> 11:39.531
Because for
a limited time only...

11:39.616 --> 11:42.034
glamour shots by Deb
are 75% off.

11:42.118 --> 11:44.661
I already get my hair cut
at the Cuttin' Corral.

11:44.746 --> 11:50.250
Well, maybe you'd be interested
in some home-woven handicrafts.

11:50.335 --> 11:52.836
I'm Rex,

11:52.921 --> 11:55.089
founder of the Rex Kwon
Do Self-Defense System.

11:55.173 --> 11:59.051
After one week with me in my dojo,
you'll be prepared to defend yourself...

11:59.135 --> 12:01.261
with the strength
of a grizzly,

12:01.388 --> 12:05.516
The reflexes of a puma...

12:05.600 --> 12:07.851
and the wisdom of a man.

12:09.479 --> 12:12.189
Come down today
for your free trial lesson!

12:15.735 --> 12:18.779
In here we have
some boondoggle key chains.

12:18.863 --> 12:21.615
A must-have for
this season's fashion.

12:21.699 --> 12:24.451
I already made, like, infinity
of those at Scout camp.

12:24.536 --> 12:26.578
Well, is anyone else here?

12:26.663 --> 12:28.914
I'm trying to earn money
for college.

12:28.998 --> 12:31.500
Your mom goes to college.

12:31.584 --> 12:34.420
Let's bring in that—

12:54.732 --> 12:57.943
Tina, you fat lard.
Come get some dinner.

13:02.699 --> 13:05.284
Tina, eat.
Eat the food.

13:06.286 --> 13:08.454
Eat the food!

13:24.637 --> 13:27.890
It'd be nice if you could
pull me into town.

13:41.529 --> 13:44.573
My name is Rex, and if you
study with my eight-week program,

13:44.657 --> 13:46.617
you will learn a system
of self-defense...

13:46.701 --> 13:49.495
that I developed over two seasons
of fighting in the Octagon.

13:49.579 --> 13:52.581
It's called Rex Kwon Do!

13:52.665 --> 13:55.542
I need a volunteer.

13:55.627 --> 13:58.003
Okay, you'll do.
Come up here.

13:59.464 --> 14:01.882
Bow to your sensei.
Bow to your sensei!

14:01.966 --> 14:03.884
Okay.

14:03.968 --> 14:07.012
Now, I'm gonna give you
one chance.

14:07.096 --> 14:09.765
One chance, people.
Give me your best shot.

14:13.770 --> 14:16.355
All right.
That was pretty good. Okay.

14:16.439 --> 14:18.398
Now, watch this, everybody.

14:18.483 --> 14:20.651
Grab my arm.
The other arm.

14:20.735 --> 14:22.694
My other arm.

14:22.779 --> 14:25.531
Now watch this. I'm just gonna
break the wrist and walk away.

14:25.615 --> 14:27.491
Break the wrist, walk away.

14:27.617 --> 14:29.701
Geez!
Okay.

14:29.786 --> 14:32.538
It's just that simple.
Now, I want you to kick me.

14:32.622 --> 14:34.706
Come on. Kick me.

14:35.833 --> 14:37.751
Okay, do it again.

14:37.835 --> 14:39.878
Do it again.

14:40.004 --> 14:42.881
Ouch. Okay. You'll block it every time.

14:42.966 --> 14:45.551
Have a seat.

14:45.635 --> 14:47.928
Now, in addition to
what you just saw,

14:48.012 --> 14:51.765
if you study with my eight-week
program, you're gonna learn these things.

14:51.849 --> 14:53.809
First off,

14:53.893 --> 14:55.811
Rex Kwon Do,
we use the buddy system.

14:55.895 --> 15:00.399
No more flyin' solo. You need somebody
watching your back at all times!

15:00.483 --> 15:03.735
Second off, you're gonna learn
to discipline your image.

15:03.820 --> 15:05.821
Do you think I got
where I am today...

15:05.905 --> 15:07.656
because I dress like
Peter Pan here?

15:08.950 --> 15:11.118
Take a look at what
I'm wearing, people.

15:11.202 --> 15:13.662
Do you think anybody wants
a roundhouse kick to the face...

15:13.746 --> 15:16.540
while I'm wearin'
these bad boys?

15:16.624 --> 15:19.751
Forget about it.
Last off,

15:19.836 --> 15:23.922
my students will learn
about self-respect.

15:24.007 --> 15:28.427
Do you think anybody thinks I'm a failure
because I go home to Starla at night?

15:28.511 --> 15:31.013
Forget about it!

15:31.097 --> 15:34.057
Now, for only $300,
you can sign up right now...

15:34.142 --> 15:36.393
for my eight-week program.

15:44.193 --> 15:46.153
Well, that place
was a rip-off.

16:04.714 --> 16:06.715
Hey, Lyle.

16:18.269 --> 16:20.896
Nothin' on here works smooth.

16:35.953 --> 16:39.206
# Some say love #

16:39.290 --> 16:44.044
# It is a river#

16:44.128 --> 16:46.963
# That drowns #

16:47.048 --> 16:51.176
# The tender reed #

16:51.260 --> 16:54.596
# Some say love #

16:54.681 --> 16:59.184
# It is a razor #

16:59.268 --> 17:02.270
# That leaves #

17:02.355 --> 17:05.482
# Your soul to bleed #

17:06.567 --> 17:09.778
# Some say love #

17:09.862 --> 17:14.866
# It is a hunger #

17:14.951 --> 17:18.537
# An endless #

17:18.621 --> 17:22.708
# Aching need #

17:22.791 --> 17:26.211
# I say love #

17:26.295 --> 17:31.299
# It is a flower#

17:31.384 --> 17:34.010
# And you ##

17:41.227 --> 17:44.146
So me and you are pretty much
friends by now, right?

17:44.230 --> 17:46.148
Yes.

17:46.232 --> 17:48.483
So, you got my back
and everything?

17:48.568 --> 17:50.026
What?

17:51.529 --> 17:54.489
Never mind.

17:54.574 --> 17:58.160
- Have you heard about the dance?
- Yes.

17:58.244 --> 18:00.662
Have you met anyone to ask yet?

18:00.747 --> 18:04.332
No. But I probably will
after school.

18:04.417 --> 18:06.668
Who you gonna ask?

18:06.753 --> 18:09.796
That girl over there.

18:09.881 --> 18:14.509
- She braided my hair one time—
- Summer Wheatly? How the heck are you gonna do that?

18:14.594 --> 18:17.262
Build her a cake
or something.

18:18.931 --> 18:20.891
Yeah, my old girlfriend
from Oklahoma...

18:20.975 --> 18:22.934
was gonna fly out here
for the dance,

18:23.019 --> 18:25.729
but she couldn't 'cause she's
doing some modeling right now.

18:25.813 --> 18:28.356
Is she hot?

18:33.362 --> 18:35.363
See for yourself.

18:38.659 --> 18:43.371
Yeah, I took her to the mall to get some
glamour shots for her birthday one year.

18:44.373 --> 18:47.083
I like her bangs.
Me too.

18:53.049 --> 18:55.801
How long did it take you
to grow that mustache?

18:55.885 --> 18:57.886
A couple of days.

18:57.970 --> 19:00.263
I wish I could grow one.

19:05.228 --> 19:07.687
Are you gonna eat your Tots?

19:07.772 --> 19:10.565
No.

19:10.650 --> 19:11.942
Can I have 'em?

19:41.055 --> 19:44.140
You see that girl
over there?

19:44.225 --> 19:46.935
She came over to my house
the other day.

19:47.061 --> 19:49.020
Why?
I don't know,

19:49.105 --> 19:51.773
but she left all this crap
on my porch.

19:53.609 --> 19:55.694
She's pretty good-looking.

19:55.778 --> 19:57.863
Do you dare me
to go talk to her?

19:57.947 --> 20:00.156
Sure.

20:11.752 --> 20:16.047
I see you're drinking one-percent.
Is that 'cause you think you're fat?

20:18.175 --> 20:21.887
'Cause you're not. You could be
drinking whole if you wanted to.

20:23.681 --> 20:27.642
Well, I have all
your equipment in my locker.

20:27.727 --> 20:31.980
You should probably come get it 'cause I
can't fit my nunchakus in there anymore.

20:33.357 --> 20:35.358
Where's your locker?

20:44.493 --> 20:46.828
Hey, can I have
one of your key chains?

21:38.839 --> 21:42.133
Hello?

22:09.745 --> 22:11.746
Napoleon, give me
some of your Tots.

22:11.831 --> 22:14.874
- No, go find your own.
- Come on. Give me some of your Tots.

22:14.959 --> 22:18.086
No. I'm freakin' starved. I
didn't get to eat anything today.

22:18.170 --> 22:20.672
G—

22:20.756 --> 22:23.174
Gross.

22:23.259 --> 22:26.344
Freakin' idiot!

22:32.560 --> 22:35.353
Tina, come get some ham.

23:03.007 --> 23:05.216
What are you doing here,
Uncle Rico?

23:05.301 --> 23:09.012
Your grandma took a little spill at
the sand dunes today, broke her coccyx.

23:09.096 --> 23:12.015
What? Since when
does she go to the dunes?

23:18.189 --> 23:20.690
Looks like there's a lot
you don't know about her.

23:34.163 --> 23:36.289
So, when's Grandma
coming back? I don't know.

23:36.373 --> 23:40.502
- Not sure.
- You don't have to stay here with us. We're not babies.

23:40.586 --> 23:44.047
Talk to your Auntie Caroline.

23:44.131 --> 23:46.841
Well, Kip is, like,
32 years old.

23:46.926 --> 23:48.843
I don't mind
if you stay.

23:48.928 --> 23:51.179
Oh. Thanks, Kip.

23:51.263 --> 23:55.308
What the flip was Grandma
doin' at the sand dunes?

23:55.392 --> 23:58.937
She was on a date...
with her boyfriend.

23:59.021 --> 24:01.231
Boyfriend?

24:02.566 --> 24:05.527
Hey, you guys
want to see my video?

24:28.634 --> 24:31.594
So, what do you think?

24:31.720 --> 24:34.806
It's pretty cool, I guess.

24:34.890 --> 24:37.142
Man, I wish I could
go back in time.

24:37.226 --> 24:39.477
I'd take state.

24:39.562 --> 24:41.896
This is pretty much
the worst video ever made.

24:41.981 --> 24:45.066
Napoleon, like anyone
can even know that.

24:45.151 --> 24:48.319
You know what, Napoleon?
You can leave.

24:48.404 --> 24:50.363
You guys are retarded.

24:50.447 --> 24:52.490
Hah!

24:52.575 --> 24:54.909
Hey, check that out.

25:09.383 --> 25:11.301
So, you and Tammy
still together?

25:11.385 --> 25:14.596
No. Not really.

25:16.015 --> 25:18.183
- Why is that?
- Well,

25:19.894 --> 25:21.811
she's jealous.

25:21.896 --> 25:24.689
Says I'm livin'
too much in '82.

25:24.773 --> 25:26.691
Well, I dumped her.

25:28.903 --> 25:31.905
What about your girlfriend?

25:31.989 --> 25:34.657
Well, things are gettin'
pretty serious right now.

25:34.742 --> 25:37.952
I mean, we chat online for,
like, two hours every day,

25:38.037 --> 25:41.497
so I guess you could say things
are gettin' pretty serious.

25:41.582 --> 25:47.295
I'm just really tryin' to raise a few bucks right
now so I can bring her around for a few days.

25:48.923 --> 25:51.257
Yep. Well, what's she look like?

25:51.342 --> 25:53.718
She's, uh—
She's got sandy blonde hair.

25:53.802 --> 25:55.720
She's, uh, pretty-look—

25:55.804 --> 25:57.722
pretty good-looking
face, but...

25:57.806 --> 26:00.058
I'm just gettin' really—
just kinda T.O.'d...

26:00.142 --> 26:04.020
because, I mean, she hasn't even
sent me a full body shot yet.

26:07.733 --> 26:09.734
Hey, you know,

26:10.819 --> 26:12.779
I got a little project...

26:12.863 --> 26:15.448
that we might be able to
make a little moola with.

26:15.532 --> 26:18.868
Really? That sounds pretty good.

26:18.953 --> 26:21.871
Have you ever heard of
nylon polymer?

26:24.124 --> 26:26.125
Go for it.

26:59.702 --> 27:03.579
Back in '82, I used to be able
to throw a pigskin a quarter mile.

27:03.706 --> 27:06.457
Are you serious?
I'm dead serious.

27:09.169 --> 27:11.170
Watch this.

27:17.094 --> 27:19.012
What the heck
are you doing?

27:19.096 --> 27:20.972
That's what I'm talkin' about.

27:21.056 --> 27:23.057
I better go.

27:32.568 --> 27:36.154
How much you want to make a bet I can
throw a football over them mountains?

27:37.781 --> 27:40.783
Yeah. If coach would've put me
in fourth quarter,

27:40.868 --> 27:43.703
we'd have been
state champions, no doubt.

27:43.787 --> 27:46.664
No doubt in my mind.

27:46.749 --> 27:49.042
You better believe things
would have been different.

27:49.126 --> 27:52.295
I'd have gone pro...
in a heartbeat.

27:52.379 --> 27:54.672
I'd be makin'
millions of dollars and...

27:54.757 --> 27:59.177
livin' in a...
big ol' mansion somewhere.

27:59.261 --> 28:02.847
You know, soakin' it up
in a hot tub with my soul mate.

28:07.770 --> 28:09.937
Kip,

28:10.022 --> 28:13.107
I reckon you know
a lot about cyberspace.

28:14.360 --> 28:18.404
Y- You ever come across
anything like time travel?

28:18.489 --> 28:20.490
Easy.

28:20.574 --> 28:23.451
I've already
looked into it for myself.

28:26.497 --> 28:31.042
Right on.

29:02.491 --> 29:04.409
Is Pedro here today?

29:04.493 --> 29:07.120
I don't think so. Why?

29:07.204 --> 29:09.455
Just wondering.

29:09.540 --> 29:11.791
Can you, uh,
give this to him for me?

29:12.793 --> 29:14.836
Okay.

29:15.921 --> 29:19.590
Hey, Summer,
you want to play me?

29:34.565 --> 29:37.191
Ow. God.

29:45.534 --> 29:48.786
- What are you drawing?
- A liger.

29:48.871 --> 29:50.997
What's a liger?

29:51.081 --> 29:53.458
It's pretty much
my favorite animal.

29:53.542 --> 29:55.710
It's like a lion
and a tiger mixed.

29:55.794 --> 29:58.212
Bred for
its skills in magic.

30:04.052 --> 30:06.804
Where's your friend?

30:06.889 --> 30:09.223
I don't know.
Did you see him today?

30:09.308 --> 30:11.934
No.

30:12.019 --> 30:13.936
Neither did I.

30:14.062 --> 30:17.023
Do you need a ride?
No.

30:17.107 --> 30:20.985
I missed the bus today,
but my uncle's coming to get me.

30:29.077 --> 30:31.287
See ya.

30:42.508 --> 30:44.425
Right. I— I think...

30:44.510 --> 30:47.803
just a little bit east of the cemetery
is a good little area right here.

30:47.888 --> 30:51.224
We should do it there. Don't go down
here, 'cause they don't have any money.

30:51.308 --> 30:54.560
So, how long
are we talkin' about workin'?

30:54.645 --> 30:57.396
What are you— You're
already losing your steam?

30:57.481 --> 31:00.858
No. I just— I have a
chat room meeting at 4:00.

31:00.943 --> 31:02.860
I gotta be back here by then.

31:02.986 --> 31:06.280
All right, you just start a little
earlier. That's all. All right.

31:06.365 --> 31:08.866
Or else work afterwards.
How long's the chat room?

31:08.951 --> 31:12.161
Geez, sometimes up to
three, four hours maybe.

31:14.456 --> 31:16.374
Maybe not.
I don't know.

31:16.458 --> 31:18.459
You— You pay the bills
for that?

31:18.544 --> 31:21.671
Does that cost money every time you're
on, like for minutes on the phone?

31:21.755 --> 31:23.673
Yeah. Grandma's still
payin' per minute.

31:23.757 --> 31:26.842
She gets kind of pissed at me
sometimes 'cause I'm on there so long.

31:26.927 --> 31:29.804
I'll bet she does. I'd be
throwin' you out the window.

31:33.475 --> 31:35.685
Bueno.
Hello?

31:35.769 --> 31:38.062
Who's this?
Napoleon Dynamite.

31:38.146 --> 31:40.565
Who?
Napoleon Dynamite.

31:40.649 --> 31:44.068
I'm one of Pedro's best
friends. Your name is Napoleon?

31:44.152 --> 31:46.362
Yes. Is Pedro there?

31:46.446 --> 31:48.447
No, he's not here
right now.

31:48.532 --> 31:50.533
Okay, bye.

31:51.702 --> 31:54.203
See, Crystal Street.
That's for you.

31:54.288 --> 31:57.999
I'm goin' to Adams Park. They
got some money in Adams Park.

32:00.460 --> 32:02.545
What?

32:02.629 --> 32:04.505
Let's go, Kipper. I think
we should take this...

32:04.631 --> 32:07.174
someplace a little more
private. That's a good idea.

32:08.302 --> 32:10.386
Please. Please.
Be good to me.

32:10.470 --> 32:12.888
Please, keep going.
Dead on. Dead on.

32:16.143 --> 32:18.269
Yes!

32:25.444 --> 32:29.488
Before we get started on our new
project, I have a few concerns.

32:31.074 --> 32:33.868
First off, I'm concerned about
your transportation situation.

32:33.952 --> 32:37.330
I mean, do you— you got a car
you can borrow from someone?

32:37.414 --> 32:39.332
Well, that's the problem
right now.

32:39.416 --> 32:41.375
At the moment,
nothing comes to mind.

32:48.342 --> 32:52.803
You can borrow my van for the time
being. I—I do better on foot anyway.

32:52.888 --> 32:56.724
We also need some way to make us look
official, like we got all the answers.

32:56.808 --> 32:59.226
How about some gold bracelets?

33:00.395 --> 33:02.396
We need, like,
some name tags...

33:02.481 --> 33:04.607
with our picture on it,
all laminated and whatnot.

33:04.691 --> 33:06.609
I mean, we gotta
look legit, man.

33:06.693 --> 33:08.611
That's true. That's true.

33:08.695 --> 33:11.405
Say, you know of a— a place
we can get our picture taken,

33:11.490 --> 33:13.407
like a— a photo store?

33:13.492 --> 33:15.409
Okay.

33:15.494 --> 33:18.120
Turn your head
on more of a slant.

33:20.457 --> 33:22.625
Now, make a fist,

33:22.709 --> 33:24.919
and slowly ease it up
underneath your chin.

33:28.882 --> 33:32.677
- This is looking really good.
- You can say that again.

33:34.930 --> 33:36.972
Okay, hold still right there.

33:37.057 --> 33:39.600
Now, just imagine
you're weightless.

33:40.644 --> 33:42.853
You're in the middle
of the ocean,

33:42.938 --> 33:45.940
surrounded by
tiny little sea horses.

33:52.572 --> 33:56.033
That was the one. I think that's
gonna come out really nice.

33:56.118 --> 33:59.620
Uh, you did it?

33:59.705 --> 34:03.457
Wow. Wow, that felt
really relaxed.

34:03.542 --> 34:05.418
Thanks, Deb.

34:05.544 --> 34:09.463
You're up, Kip.

34:11.717 --> 34:14.467
Is there some kind of vest
that I can wear?

34:23.562 --> 34:26.897
- Where have you been?
- I got sick.

34:28.942 --> 34:31.025
Has Summer said
anything to you yet?

34:31.110 --> 34:33.279
No, not yet.

34:33.362 --> 34:35.197
Well, she said no.

34:35.282 --> 34:37.199
She did?

34:38.618 --> 34:41.661
- Well, what about that other girl?
- What other girl?

34:41.746 --> 34:44.790
- The one that left all that crap on your porch.
- You mean Deb?

34:44.916 --> 34:47.543
Yes, her.
What about her?

34:47.627 --> 34:50.420
- Well, I asked her out too.
- What?

35:23.121 --> 35:25.664
Well, nobody's gonna
go out with me.

35:27.375 --> 35:30.503
Have you asked anybody yet?
No, but who would?

35:30.629 --> 35:34.006
I don't even have any good
skills. What do you mean?

35:34.090 --> 35:36.467
You know, like...

35:36.551 --> 35:39.637
nunchaku skills,
bow hunting skills,

35:39.721 --> 35:41.972
computer hacking skills.

35:43.225 --> 35:45.684
Girls only want boyfriends
who have great skills.

35:45.769 --> 35:47.978
Aren't you pretty good
at drawing, like,

35:48.063 --> 35:49.980
animals and warriors and stuff?

35:50.065 --> 35:52.274
Yes.

35:52.359 --> 35:54.693
Probably the best
that I know of.

35:54.778 --> 35:57.446
Just draw a picture of the
girl you want to take out...

35:57.531 --> 36:00.199
and give it to her
for, like, a gift or something.

36:01.243 --> 36:03.577
That's a pretty good idea.

36:31.147 --> 36:34.149
Now, if you invest
in the 24-piece set,

36:34.234 --> 36:36.694
I'm gonna throw in
a little gift.

36:36.778 --> 36:39.113
So, what's the gift?

36:40.740 --> 36:44.410
I bet you folks
don't have one of these.

36:49.416 --> 36:51.584
I want that.

36:51.668 --> 36:54.712
You see, this ain't your
run-of-the-mill "crapper-ware. "

36:54.796 --> 36:58.424
These are some serious
"NuPont" fiber-woven bowls.

36:58.508 --> 37:01.552
So, if we purchase
the 24-piece set,

37:01.636 --> 37:03.554
the mini sailboat
is included?

37:03.638 --> 37:05.764
That's correct, sir.

37:05.849 --> 37:09.018
Lance, you look like
a strong young pup.

37:10.395 --> 37:13.981
Why don't you see if you can
give that a nice tear.

37:21.907 --> 37:24.617
Don't hurt yourself now.

37:24.701 --> 37:26.660
I can't do it.

37:26.745 --> 37:28.913
Can't do it.

37:31.750 --> 37:33.792
So, uh,

37:33.877 --> 37:36.378
how does the "dealio"
sound to you?

37:51.519 --> 37:54.229
Dang it.

38:17.253 --> 38:20.381
- Is Trisha here?
- Oh, I'm sorry, she's not.

38:20.465 --> 38:23.717
- She's at a friend's house right now.
- Well, hey, Napoleon.

38:26.763 --> 38:30.808
- Napoleon's my nephew.
- Oh, that's nice.

38:30.892 --> 38:33.394
Could you just give this
to her for me?

38:33.478 --> 38:38.273
- I certainly could.
- Thanks.

38:38.358 --> 38:40.067
Bye-bye.

38:43.196 --> 38:47.783
Poor kid. I've been takin' care of him
while his grandma's in the hospital.

38:48.994 --> 38:51.412
He still wets the bed
and everything.

38:51.496 --> 38:53.414
You're kidding.

38:53.498 --> 38:57.459
Yeah, he's a tender little guy.
He still gets beat up and whatnot.

38:58.461 --> 39:01.171
Anyway, uh,

39:01.256 --> 39:07.094
so we still feelin' pretty good
about this, uh, 32-piece set here?

39:07.220 --> 39:10.180
Ow! What the crap was Uncle Rico
doin' at my girlfriend's house?

39:10.265 --> 39:13.183
Napoleon, let go of me! I think
you're bruisin' my neck meat!

39:13.268 --> 39:14.560
Fine.

39:14.644 --> 39:16.645
What the heck
are you guys doin'?

39:16.730 --> 39:20.232
Tryin' to ruin my life and make
me look like a friggin' idiot?

39:20.316 --> 39:22.651
I'm out makin' some
sweet moola with Uncle Rico.

39:22.736 --> 39:24.820
Geez, I think
you ripped my mole off.

39:24.904 --> 39:27.948
- I did?
- Yeah, is it bleeding?

39:28.074 --> 39:30.034
A little bit.

39:30.118 --> 39:32.036
Hey, Kip.

39:36.082 --> 39:39.001
I wish you wouldn't look
at me like that, Napoleon.

39:39.085 --> 39:41.670
I wish you'd get out
of my life and shut up.

39:41.755 --> 39:45.049
I'm gonna tell you somethin'. While you're
playin' patty-cake with your friend Pedro,

39:45.133 --> 39:47.885
your Uncle Rico...
is makin' 120 bucks.

39:47.969 --> 39:50.596
I could make that much money
in five seconds.

39:50.680 --> 39:53.724
Geez. Yeah, right, Napoleon.
I made, like, 75 bucks today.

39:55.018 --> 39:57.269
Napoleon, it looks like
you don't have a job.

39:57.353 --> 39:59.354
So why don't you
get out there and feed Tina.

39:59.439 --> 40:01.690
Why don't you go eat
a "decroded" piece of rap.

40:05.320 --> 40:08.072
There's a lot more
where this came from...

40:08.156 --> 40:10.074
if you go to the dance with me.

40:10.158 --> 40:12.659
Yours truly, Napoleon Dynamite.

40:22.670 --> 40:25.756
You know you're gonna go
to that dance with that boy.

40:28.176 --> 40:31.345
By noon I need them 8,000 hens
moved into their new cages.

40:31.429 --> 40:34.723
Sometimes they don't
want to cooperate.

40:34.808 --> 40:38.310
But you give 'em a good shakin',
they'll settle down for ya.

40:38.394 --> 40:40.687
Do the chickens have
large talons?

40:40.772 --> 40:43.190
- Do they have what?
- Large talons.

40:43.274 --> 40:46.235
I don't understand
a word you just said.

40:47.946 --> 40:50.155
Okay, you meet me back here
about noon, and, uh,

40:50.240 --> 40:52.658
we'll have a little lunch
waitin' for ya.

41:32.240 --> 41:34.241
Ew!

41:54.387 --> 41:56.805
Well, dig in.

42:22.957 --> 42:25.125
Over there, in that pigpen,

42:25.210 --> 42:28.045
I found a couple
of Shoshoni arrowheads.

42:39.974 --> 42:43.810
Can't find my checkbook. Hope you
don't mind I pay you in change.

42:47.523 --> 42:49.233
Six dollars.

42:50.944 --> 42:52.903
That's, like, a dollar
an hour.

42:58.701 --> 43:00.410
Hello?

43:00.495 --> 43:03.080
- Hi. Is Napoleon there?
- Yes.

43:05.166 --> 43:07.876
- Can I talk to him?
- You already are.

43:10.004 --> 43:13.257
Napoleon, this is Trisha.

43:13.341 --> 43:15.509
I'm just calling
to tell you that...

43:15.593 --> 43:17.970
I can go to the dance
with you.

43:18.096 --> 43:20.138
And also,

43:20.223 --> 43:23.892
I wanted to thank you for the
beautiful drawing you did of me.

43:24.018 --> 43:26.979
It's hanging in my bedroom. Really?

43:27.063 --> 43:30.691
Took me, like, three hours to
finish the shading on your upper lip.

43:30.775 --> 43:33.277
It's probably the best
drawing I've ever done.

43:33.361 --> 43:36.071
Yeah, it's really...
nice.

43:36.155 --> 43:39.783
Yeah, well, I'll probably pick
you up at 6:00 for the dance.

43:39.867 --> 43:43.036
- Is that okay?
- That's fine.

43:43.121 --> 43:44.538
Okay, bye.

43:45.873 --> 43:48.625
Bye.

43:55.216 --> 43:58.176
Who was that?
Trisha.

43:58.261 --> 44:01.805
- Who's she?
- My woman I'm takin' to the dance.

44:01.889 --> 44:05.183
- You draw her a picture?
- Heck, yes, I did!

44:05.268 --> 44:09.062
- Well, what are you going
to wear to the dance?

44:09.147 --> 44:11.273
Just, like, a silk shirt
or something.

44:11.399 --> 44:14.067
What are you gonna wear?
Deb has something for me.

44:14.152 --> 44:16.695
But you should probably
get a suit.

44:21.909 --> 44:25.329
Pedro, how do you feel
about that one?

44:25.413 --> 44:27.331
It looks nice.

44:27.415 --> 44:29.333
Yeah. It looks
pretty sweet.

44:29.417 --> 44:31.501
It looks awesome.

44:31.586 --> 44:34.463
That suit, it's—
It's incredible.

45:16.130 --> 45:18.173
I need you to give me a ride
in an hour.

45:18.257 --> 45:20.675
Where to?

45:20.760 --> 45:22.469
The dance.

45:23.805 --> 45:25.806
You takin' my client's daughter? Yes.

45:25.890 --> 45:27.891
We need to pick her up too.

45:27.975 --> 45:33.605
Well, Uncle Rico's got a sale to
finalize in Bonita in five minutes.

45:33.689 --> 45:36.817
Can't you take me and then drop me
off when you're done or whatever?

45:54.585 --> 45:56.837
Well, I'll be back
in a minute.

45:56.921 --> 45:59.297
Don't disturb me
while I'm in there.

45:59.382 --> 46:02.175
Well, hurry up,
'cause I gotta get Trisha.

46:22.363 --> 46:26.032
Hi. I got your 24-piece set
right here.

48:19.897 --> 48:23.400
So you guys are, like, Pedro's
cousins with all the sweet hookups?

48:23.484 --> 48:25.402
Simón.

48:36.706 --> 48:39.708
Is Trisha here?

48:39.792 --> 48:43.169
Who's that in my driveway?

48:45.047 --> 48:47.299
That's my ride.

49:08.154 --> 49:11.615
# Let's dance in style
Let's dance for a while #

49:11.699 --> 49:15.118
# Heaven can wait We're
only watching the skies #

49:15.202 --> 49:18.121
# Hoping for the best
but expecting the worst #

49:18.205 --> 49:20.874
# Are you gonna
drop the bomb or not #

49:22.168 --> 49:25.462
# Let us die young
or let us live forever#

49:25.546 --> 49:29.007
# We don't have the power
but we never say never#

49:29.091 --> 49:32.886
# Sitting in a sandpit
Life is a short trip #

49:33.012 --> 49:35.847
# The music's for the sad men #

49:35.931 --> 49:39.726
# Can you imagine
when this race is won #

49:39.810 --> 49:43.188
# Turn our golden faces
into the sun #

49:43.272 --> 49:46.149
# Praising our leaders
We're getting in tune #

49:46.233 --> 49:49.277
# The music's played
by the— the madmen #

49:49.362 --> 49:53.239
Do you wanna go over by my friend
Pedro and dance really quick?

49:53.324 --> 49:55.492
# Forever young #

49:55.618 --> 50:00.330
# Do you really want
to live forever #

50:00.414 --> 50:03.750
# Forever and ever#

50:03.834 --> 50:05.835
# Forever young #

50:05.920 --> 50:09.422
# I want to be forever young #

50:10.925 --> 50:14.511
# Do you really want
to live forever#

50:20.810 --> 50:25.188
# Some are like water
Some are like the heat #

50:25.272 --> 50:29.401
# Some are a melody
and some are the beat #

50:51.465 --> 50:53.383
#... couldn't happen today #

50:53.467 --> 50:57.053
# So many songs
we forgot to play #

50:57.138 --> 51:00.140
# So many dreams
swinging out of the blue #

51:00.266 --> 51:05.353
# We'll let 'em come true #
Napoleon.

51:05.438 --> 51:07.981
When did you
get here?

51:08.065 --> 51:10.900
Just a couple minutes ago.

51:10.985 --> 51:13.153
Have you guys
seen Trisha anywhere?

51:13.237 --> 51:15.405
No.

51:17.658 --> 51:19.659
She probably
just went to the bathroom.

51:22.246 --> 51:25.415
Are you guys having
a killer time?

51:25.499 --> 51:28.042
Yes.

51:28.127 --> 51:30.795
# Forever and ever#

51:30.880 --> 51:33.715
# Forever young #

51:33.799 --> 51:36.843
# I want to be forever young ##

51:39.680 --> 51:44.017
If you can't find Trisha, I'll let
you dance with Deb for a few songs.

51:46.228 --> 51:50.774
# Lyin' in my bed
I hear the clock tick #

51:50.858 --> 51:53.651
# And I think of you #

51:53.736 --> 51:56.237
I like your sleeves.
They're real big.

51:57.531 --> 51:59.449
Thank you.

51:59.533 --> 52:02.035
I made them myself.

52:05.414 --> 52:08.583
So you and Pedro are getting
really serious now?

52:08.667 --> 52:10.585
No.

52:10.669 --> 52:12.587
We're just friends.

52:18.010 --> 52:20.386
How your glamour shots
been going lately?

52:21.472 --> 52:23.473
Pretty good.

52:26.560 --> 52:30.188
I could do
a personal portrait sometime...

52:30.272 --> 52:32.232
if you wanted to come over.

52:34.026 --> 52:35.735
Okay.

52:35.820 --> 52:38.488
# The second hand unwinds #

52:38.572 --> 52:43.409
# If you're lost, you can look
and you will find me #

52:43.494 --> 52:45.995
# Time after time #

52:46.080 --> 52:50.667
# If you fall, I will catch you
I'll be waiting #

52:50.751 --> 52:53.419
# Time after time #

52:53.504 --> 52:58.132
# If you're lost, you can look
and you will find me #

52:58.217 --> 53:00.677
# Time after time #

53:00.761 --> 53:05.306
# If you fall, I will catch you
I will be waiting #

53:05.391 --> 53:07.100
# Time after time ##

53:25.160 --> 53:28.288
Do you think people
will vote for me?

53:28.372 --> 53:30.790
Heck, yes.
I'd vote for you.

53:30.875 --> 53:33.126
Like, what are my skills?

53:33.210 --> 53:35.336
Well, you have a sweet bike,

53:35.421 --> 53:39.007
and you're really good
at hookin' up with chicks.

53:39.091 --> 53:42.510
Plus you're, like, the only guy
at school who has a mustache.

53:42.595 --> 53:44.512
That's true.

53:44.597 --> 53:48.016
If you need to use any of my
skills, I can do whatever you want.

53:48.100 --> 53:50.226
Thanks.

53:50.311 --> 53:53.563
If I win, you can be
my secretary or something.

53:53.647 --> 53:57.692
Sweet! Plus I could be
your bodyguard too.

53:57.776 --> 54:02.113
Or, like, Secret Service
captain or... whatever.

54:02.197 --> 54:04.198
Okay.

54:11.040 --> 54:13.416
Is that yours?

54:13.500 --> 54:15.835
Don't touch it.
It's Uncle Rico's.

54:15.920 --> 54:18.004
What's it for?

54:20.925 --> 54:23.676
It's a time machine,
Napoleon. He bought it online.

54:25.387 --> 54:29.182
Yeah, right. It works,
Napoleon. You don't even know.

54:29.266 --> 54:31.517
Have you guys
tried it yet?

54:31.602 --> 54:33.394
No.

54:54.667 --> 54:57.877
- So, are you ready?
- Yeah. Hold on.

54:57.962 --> 55:01.547
I forgot
to put in the crystals.

55:03.634 --> 55:06.844
Okay, turn it on.

55:06.929 --> 55:09.055
Kill—

55:09.139 --> 55:11.182
the pow—

55:11.266 --> 55:13.726
Kill—

55:13.811 --> 55:15.520
Turn it off!
Turn it off!

55:18.065 --> 55:21.275
It's a piece of rap.
It doesn't work.

55:21.360 --> 55:24.570
Well, I could've told you that.

55:37.501 --> 55:41.087
I- I said the 12 pack,
not the 24 pack.

55:41.171 --> 55:43.172
You're just gonna have
to mix and match.

55:43.257 --> 55:45.508
Shut up. Say it
so the whole world can hear.

55:45.592 --> 55:48.094
Well, put it back.

55:54.435 --> 55:57.311
Napoleon, you know
we can't afford the fun pack.

55:57.396 --> 56:01.107
You think money grows on trees
in this family? Take it back.

56:01.191 --> 56:03.693
Get some Pampers for you and
your brother while you're at it.

56:07.322 --> 56:10.158
We can use a little of
this. I can tell you that.

56:10.284 --> 56:14.579
We can use those.

56:23.630 --> 56:27.258
The defect in that one
is bleach.

56:29.178 --> 56:32.013
That's correct.
Yes!

56:44.193 --> 56:47.111
This tastes like the cow
got into an onion patch.

56:48.989 --> 56:51.824
Correct.
Yes!

56:54.661 --> 56:58.206
They're pretty good except
for one little problem.

56:59.541 --> 57:04.003
That little guy right there,
he has nipple number five.

57:04.088 --> 57:06.089
A good dairy cow
should have, like, four.

57:06.173 --> 57:09.217
Well done.

57:09.301 --> 57:12.303
Vote for Summer.
Vote for Summer.

57:12.387 --> 57:15.431
Vote for Summer. Thanks.

57:15.516 --> 57:17.892
Yeah.
Vote for Summer.

57:20.354 --> 57:22.438
Hi. Vote for Summer.

57:22.523 --> 57:24.607
Hi, ladies. Vote for
Summer. You guys voting?

57:28.403 --> 57:32.073
Do you think it's
kinda warm in here? No.

57:34.368 --> 57:37.662
I think it's— They have
the heater on or something.

57:37.746 --> 57:40.873
It seems
pretty good to me.

57:40.999 --> 57:45.962
You don't feel like your head is burning or
- or anything? No.

57:47.172 --> 57:49.549
I'm gonna go home
and lay down.

57:49.633 --> 57:51.634
Okay. See ya.

58:01.186 --> 58:03.062
Vote for Summer.
Yeah, right.

58:03.147 --> 58:06.315
- I'm not votin' for her.
- Then who are you gonna vote for?

58:06.400 --> 58:08.484
I'm votin' for Pedro Sanchez.
Who do you think?

58:11.488 --> 58:15.575
Hey, Don, can I have
one of those buttons?

58:25.669 --> 58:28.212
Hey. Vote for Summer.

58:28.297 --> 58:30.381
Hi. Vote for Summer.

58:32.551 --> 58:35.845
So, that guy in Florida
give you your money back yet?

58:35.929 --> 58:38.973
Oh, I wrote him an e-mail, sayin'
I'm gonna contact the authorities...

58:39.057 --> 58:42.476
if I don't get
a refund in full.

58:42.561 --> 58:46.314
Don't you ever wish
you could go back...

58:46.398 --> 58:49.108
with all the knowledge
you have now? Tsk.

58:49.193 --> 58:51.485
I guess so.

58:51.570 --> 58:55.072
Well, I'll tell you somethin' right
now. You'd find your soul mate.

58:55.157 --> 58:58.826
- I've already got a soul mate.
- Oh, yeah. What's her name again?

58:58.911 --> 59:02.288
- Lafawnduh.
- Lafawnduh.

59:02.372 --> 59:05.917
- How's she doin'?
- Well, I think I'm gonna need some time off.

59:06.001 --> 59:08.920
She's flyin' out from Detroit
for a few days.

59:09.004 --> 59:13.216
Well, what about work? Well, haven't—
haven't you studied up on the new product?

59:13.300 --> 59:17.220
- Yes.
- Well, do you know it backwards and front?

59:17.304 --> 59:18.888
Basically.

59:20.224 --> 59:22.892
Why don't you sell some
to that girlfriend of yours?

59:22.976 --> 59:25.478
You might as well do somethin'
while you're doin' nothin'.

59:25.562 --> 59:28.314
Because she doesn't need any.
That's why.

59:33.111 --> 59:36.822
Hey. I did some drawings
for the flyers.

59:36.907 --> 59:38.991
Thanks.

59:39.076 --> 59:41.869
Why do you got
your hood on like that?

59:41.954 --> 59:46.958
Well, when I came home from school,
my head started to get really hot.

59:47.084 --> 59:52.380
So I drank some cold water,
but it didn't do nothing.

59:52.464 --> 59:54.423
So I laid in the bathtub
for a while,

59:54.508 --> 59:59.762
but then I realized that it was my
hair that was making my head so hot.

59:59.846 --> 01:00:03.307
So I went into my kitchen,
and I shaved it all off.

01:00:04.351 --> 01:00:06.727
I don't want anyone to see.

01:00:07.729 --> 01:00:10.356
I know what you mean.

01:00:12.359 --> 01:00:16.112
There's just
so many options.

01:00:18.699 --> 01:00:22.743
That one's good.
Looks like a medieval warrior.

01:00:24.329 --> 01:00:27.999
You know, you're right.
That's a good one.

01:00:33.422 --> 01:00:35.423
Sorry.

01:00:39.761 --> 01:00:41.721
I think this matches
your season, Pedro.

01:00:41.805 --> 01:00:44.223
Thank you.

01:01:17.799 --> 01:01:19.925
Vote for Pedro.
Vote for Pedro.

01:01:20.052 --> 01:01:22.261
Vote for Pedro.
Vote for Pedro.

01:01:22.387 --> 01:01:24.305
Vote for me.
Vote for Pedro.

01:01:24.389 --> 01:01:26.265
- Vote for Pedro.
Vote for me.

01:01:26.391 --> 01:01:29.810
Vote for Pedro.
Vote for Pedro.

01:01:29.936 --> 01:01:32.938
Vote for Pedro. Vote for
Pedro. Vote for... Pedro.

01:01:36.735 --> 01:01:38.652
Hey, give me 50 cents
so I can buy a pop.

01:01:38.779 --> 01:01:40.905
I don't have any, Randy.
Come on. I'll pay you back.

01:01:40.989 --> 01:01:44.450
I don't have—
Stop.

01:01:44.534 --> 01:01:48.496
- Don't. Stop. Stop.
- I'll do this to you.

01:01:48.622 --> 01:01:50.831
Don't.
Ow.

01:01:50.916 --> 01:01:52.917
Here. Here.

01:02:05.931 --> 01:02:09.767
- How's your neck?
- Stings.

01:02:09.851 --> 01:02:11.894
That's too bad.

01:02:13.522 --> 01:02:16.732
Pedro offers you his protection.

01:02:24.825 --> 01:02:26.659
Hey, let me borrow your bike. No.

01:02:26.785 --> 01:02:29.453
Come on. I'll give you some chips. No.

01:03:28.680 --> 01:03:31.098
Like a wash, and then you
blow-dry it with bleach.

01:03:31.183 --> 01:03:33.184
Yeah. It's so cool.

01:03:38.690 --> 01:03:40.566
Hey, you Trisha?

01:03:40.650 --> 01:03:43.611
- Yeah.
- You remember me?

01:03:43.695 --> 01:03:48.282
I'm a friend of your mom's. I'm—
I'm Napoleon's uncle. Uncle Rico.

01:03:49.910 --> 01:03:53.412
- Oh. Yeah.
- Hey, could you do me a favor?

01:03:54.581 --> 01:03:56.457
Could you give your mom
a couple of these...

01:03:56.541 --> 01:03:59.835
and tell 'em to hand 'em out
to her friends or whoever?

01:03:59.920 --> 01:04:01.795
'Kay.

01:04:01.880 --> 01:04:06.258
You girls give me a call if you
feel like you could use some.

01:04:14.100 --> 01:04:16.101
Have a nice day.

01:06:14.888 --> 01:06:18.641
Why the heck you throwin'
crap at my van, Napoleon?

01:06:18.725 --> 01:06:22.519
Everybody at school thinks I'm
a freakin' idiot 'cause of you.

01:06:22.604 --> 01:06:25.189
You're gonna clean my van...
right now.

01:06:25.315 --> 01:06:27.733
Get off of me,
you "bodaggit. "

01:06:43.875 --> 01:06:48.545
Higher. No, no, higher.

01:06:48.672 --> 01:06:51.173
Yeah!

01:06:52.717 --> 01:06:56.261
Yeah. Hit it!

01:07:00.517 --> 01:07:02.518
Dang.

01:07:32.799 --> 01:07:37.052
Look, Pedro. I don't know how
they do things down in Juárez,

01:07:37.137 --> 01:07:40.389
but here in Idaho we have a
little something called pride.

01:07:40.473 --> 01:07:42.933
Understand?

01:07:43.017 --> 01:07:47.896
Smashing in the face of a piñata
that resembles Summer Wheatly...

01:07:47.981 --> 01:07:52.985
is a disgrace to you, me
and the entire Gem State.

01:08:06.458 --> 01:08:09.877
Welcome to D-Qwon's Dance Grooves.
Are you ready to get your groove on?

01:08:10.003 --> 01:08:13.714
Yes. All right, then. Let's get started.

01:08:24.642 --> 01:08:26.560
Are you disqualified?

01:08:28.313 --> 01:08:33.524
No. They just made me take down the
flyers as a penalty for the piñatas.

01:08:33.609 --> 01:08:36.194
Can you still
run for president?

01:08:37.322 --> 01:08:39.238
Yes.

01:08:40.283 --> 01:08:43.285
I don't understand.

01:08:43.368 --> 01:08:48.832
He say... you're not allowed to smash
piñatas that look like real people.

01:08:50.502 --> 01:08:52.877
But we do it in Mexico
all the time.

01:08:55.089 --> 01:08:57.049
Your hair looked great today.

01:08:59.176 --> 01:09:01.094
Thank you.

01:09:02.221 --> 01:09:06.475
All right.
See you tomorrow, Pedro.

01:09:20.532 --> 01:09:22.908
Who are you?

01:09:22.992 --> 01:09:26.411
- I'm Lafawnduh.
- What are you doing here?

01:09:27.497 --> 01:09:29.413
I'm waiting for Kip.

01:09:30.542 --> 01:09:34.461
- Kip?
- Why are you so sweaty?

01:09:36.548 --> 01:09:39.091
I been practicing.

01:09:39.175 --> 01:09:42.511
- Practicing what?
- Some dance moves.

01:09:44.639 --> 01:09:47.265
You like dancing?

01:09:49.310 --> 01:09:53.772
- My chores are done. So, you ready, Lafawnduh?
- I am, honey.

01:09:53.857 --> 01:09:56.817
Sorry, Napoleon. We're just runnin'
a little bit late for some prime rib.

01:09:56.943 --> 01:09:59.403
Tell Uncle Rico not to
wait up for me. Here.

01:09:59.487 --> 01:10:02.489
You might like that.
My cousin made it.

01:10:02.574 --> 01:10:05.325
I'll be waitin' outside
for you, baby.

01:10:06.995 --> 01:10:08.912
Bye, Napoleon.

01:10:08.997 --> 01:10:11.290
See ya.

01:10:13.418 --> 01:10:17.713
Lafawnduh is the best thing
that has ever happened to me.

01:10:17.797 --> 01:10:20.549
I'm a hundred percent positive
that she's my soul mate.

01:10:20.633 --> 01:10:24.386
Napoleon, I'm sure there's
a babe out there for you too.

01:10:27.223 --> 01:10:29.308
Peace out.

01:10:31.895 --> 01:10:33.896
See ya.

01:10:52.624 --> 01:10:54.875
Is this what you
were looking for?

01:10:54.959 --> 01:10:59.504
Nah, I was thinkin' of somethin' a
little more... soft around the edges.

01:10:59.589 --> 01:11:02.591
Hmm. Well,

01:11:02.675 --> 01:11:05.510
I have a nice, soft pink sheet
I could hang,

01:11:05.595 --> 01:11:10.223
and I could wrap you in some
foam or... something billowy?

01:11:12.769 --> 01:11:14.853
Yeah, billowy's good.

01:11:17.023 --> 01:11:18.941
It'd be really nice...

01:11:19.025 --> 01:11:21.735
if I could get
the fan going.

01:11:21.819 --> 01:11:24.363
I could hang some tinsel
from the top.

01:11:26.950 --> 01:11:31.620
You know, Deborah,
you have... striking features.

01:11:31.704 --> 01:11:36.083
Such a soft face should be
complimented with a...

01:11:36.167 --> 01:11:38.210
soft body.

01:11:39.337 --> 01:11:42.005
Mr. Rico?

01:11:42.090 --> 01:11:45.717
My friends and clients,
they call me "Uncle Rico. "

01:11:49.013 --> 01:11:50.973
What are you doing?

01:11:51.057 --> 01:11:54.059
Shh. Don't say another word.

01:11:55.144 --> 01:11:58.105
Napoleon told me
you'd be interested.

01:12:04.237 --> 01:12:06.446
Napoleon?

01:12:06.531 --> 01:12:10.575
You stop wishin',
and call me when you're ready.

01:12:22.922 --> 01:12:25.424
# Dancin' #

01:12:27.510 --> 01:12:33.181
# Dancin'
Dancin' #

01:12:42.233 --> 01:12:44.151
Hello?
Napoleon?

01:12:44.235 --> 01:12:47.029
- Yeah. Who's this?
- It's Deb,

01:12:47.113 --> 01:12:49.823
and I'm calling to let you know
I think you're a shallow friend.

01:12:49.907 --> 01:12:52.826
- What the heck are you even talkin' about?
- Don't lie, Napoleon.

01:12:52.910 --> 01:12:56.580
- Your Uncle Rico made it very clear how you feel about me.
- What?

01:12:56.664 --> 01:12:59.374
I don't need herbal enhancers
to feel good about myself.

01:12:59.459 --> 01:13:03.628
And if you're so concerned about that,
why don't you try eating some yourself?

01:13:13.723 --> 01:13:16.224
Right on.

01:13:16.309 --> 01:13:19.394
Grandma just called and said
you're supposed to go home.

01:13:19.479 --> 01:13:22.606
- She didn't tell me anything.
- Too bad. She says she doesn't want you here...

01:13:22.690 --> 01:13:26.234
when she gets back because you've been ruining
everybody's lives and eatin' all our steak.

01:13:26.319 --> 01:13:29.613
- I'm not goin' anywhere, Napoleon.
- Get off my property!

01:13:29.697 --> 01:13:32.741
It's a free country.
I can do whatever I want.

01:13:32.825 --> 01:13:35.994
Get off my property,
or I'll call the cops on you.

01:13:36.079 --> 01:13:38.246
Well, then do it.
Go on.

01:13:38.331 --> 01:13:40.332
Maybe I will. Gosh!

01:13:57.016 --> 01:13:58.934
- Hello?
- Pedro?

01:13:59.018 --> 01:14:01.436
- How's it goin'?
- Good.

01:14:01.521 --> 01:14:04.773
Deb just called me.
She pretty much hates me by now.

01:14:04.857 --> 01:14:07.609
- Why?
- 'Cause my Uncle Rico's an idiot!

01:14:07.693 --> 01:14:10.070
Do you have anything
to give to her?

01:14:10.154 --> 01:14:13.698
No, not unless
she likes fish.

01:14:15.660 --> 01:14:18.995
- Are you still gonna give your speech tomorrow?
- Yes.

01:14:19.122 --> 01:14:22.624
Do you already know what
you're gonna say? Yes,

01:14:22.708 --> 01:14:24.626
but not all of it.

01:14:24.710 --> 01:14:26.711
Just tell 'em that...

01:14:28.297 --> 01:14:32.259
their wildest dreams will
come true if they vote for you.

01:14:32.385 --> 01:14:36.346
I'll see you tomorrow,
Pedro.

01:14:53.364 --> 01:14:55.532
Dang it!

01:14:55.616 --> 01:14:57.909
What do you think
you're doing?

01:15:40.620 --> 01:15:46.041
Now, if you look right here, we have
Sally Johnson from Manitou, Colorado.

01:15:47.627 --> 01:15:51.880
Would you like to read her
testimonial right there? Sure. Um,

01:15:51.964 --> 01:15:56.509
"After using Bust Must Plus,
I have such big bosoms—"

01:15:57.595 --> 01:16:00.347
I don't feel comfortable
reading this.

01:16:00.431 --> 01:16:03.600
Oh, that's fine.
That's fine.

01:16:03.684 --> 01:16:06.144
But do you feel
comfortable with me?

01:16:12.526 --> 01:16:14.819
You could be...

01:16:14.904 --> 01:16:18.490
somewhere around, uh,

01:16:18.574 --> 01:16:20.659
here.

01:16:24.497 --> 01:16:26.414
Come here, boy!

01:16:40.846 --> 01:16:44.099
Well, I never thought
I would make it here today.

01:16:44.183 --> 01:16:46.268
I would be a great
class president because...

01:16:46.352 --> 01:16:49.896
I promise to put two new pop
machines in the cafeteria, and...

01:16:49.981 --> 01:16:53.233
I'm also gonna get a glitter Bonnebell
dispenser for all the girls' bathrooms.

01:16:53.317 --> 01:16:55.944
Oh, we're gonna get
new cheerleading uniforms.

01:16:56.028 --> 01:16:59.197
Anyway, I think I'd be
a great class president, so, uh,

01:16:59.282 --> 01:17:01.491
who wants to eat
"chimini-changas" next year?

01:17:01.575 --> 01:17:07.080
Not me. See, with me, it
will be summer all year long.

01:17:07.206 --> 01:17:10.292
Vote for Summer.

01:17:19.719 --> 01:17:24.347
And now Summer will perform her skit with
members of our very own Happy Hands Club.

01:17:26.851 --> 01:17:30.520
Your speech is up next. Your
skit had better be pretty good.

01:17:30.646 --> 01:17:34.983
A skit? You perform a skit
after your speech, Pedro.

01:17:35.067 --> 01:17:37.777
What?
A flippin' skit?

01:17:37.903 --> 01:17:40.071
Why didn't anybody
tell us about this?

01:17:40.156 --> 01:17:46.161
# Yeah, ha-ha-ha-ha #

01:17:55.755 --> 01:18:00.925
# I may run and hide when you're
screamin' my name All right #

01:18:02.720 --> 01:18:06.264
# But let me tell you now #

01:18:06.349 --> 01:18:09.934
# There are prices to fame
All right #

01:18:13.522 --> 01:18:17.359
# All of our time spent #

01:18:17.443 --> 01:18:22.739
# In flashes of li-i-ight #

01:18:22.823 --> 01:18:27.869
# That makes you
larger than life #

01:18:39.382 --> 01:18:44.344
I don't want to be
president anyway.

01:18:44.428 --> 01:18:46.971
Pedro, just listen
to your heart.

01:18:47.056 --> 01:18:49.641
That's what I do.

01:18:50.810 --> 01:18:54.479
I'll just tell them that
I have nothing to say.

01:19:11.372 --> 01:19:13.373
Hello.

01:19:15.167 --> 01:19:17.085
I don't have much to say.

01:19:17.169 --> 01:19:21.756
But I think it would be good to have some
holy santos brought to the high school...

01:19:21.841 --> 01:19:25.468
to guard the hallway
and to bring us good luck.

01:19:25.553 --> 01:19:30.348
El Santo Niño de Atocha is a good
one. My Aunt Concha has seen him.

01:19:31.475 --> 01:19:33.351
And...

01:19:33.477 --> 01:19:37.021
we have a great F.F.A.
Schedule lined up—

01:19:37.106 --> 01:19:40.191
And I'd like to see
more of that.

01:19:43.946 --> 01:19:48.533
If you vote for me, all of your
wildest dreams will come true.

01:19:50.119 --> 01:19:52.287
Thank you.

01:20:11.182 --> 01:20:15.226
Up next, I hope you'll enjoy
a skit by Pedro Sanchez.

01:20:54.808 --> 01:21:00.813
# You know this boogie
is for real #

01:21:02.274 --> 01:21:05.360
# I used to buy my faith
in worship #

01:21:05.444 --> 01:21:09.405
# But then my chance
to get to heaven slipped #

01:21:09.490 --> 01:21:13.201
# I used to worry
about the future #

01:21:13.285 --> 01:21:16.871
# But then I threw my caution
to the wi-i-ind #

01:21:16.956 --> 01:21:20.750
# I had no reason to be carefree
No, no, no #

01:21:20.834 --> 01:21:23.753
# Until I took a trip
to the other side of town #

01:21:23.837 --> 01:21:27.549
# Yeah, yeah, yeah # # You know
I heard that boogie rhythm #

01:21:27.633 --> 01:21:29.884
# Hey, I had no choice
but to get #

01:21:29.969 --> 01:21:31.886
# Down, down, down, down #

01:21:31.971 --> 01:21:35.557
# Dance # # Nothing
left for me to do but #

01:21:35.641 --> 01:21:39.435

And a fella give
me some years ago.

01:29:53.138 --> 01:29:56.682
He said,
"When an argument arises,

01:29:56.767 --> 01:30:01.312
"if you go outside and take,
uh, a nice walk,

01:30:01.396 --> 01:30:06.108
"you'll calm down and then you can
come back and it won't be an argument.

01:30:06.193 --> 01:30:08.402
"And you'll find
that helps your health.

01:30:08.487 --> 01:30:11.989
All that fresh air and exercise
will do you a lot of good. "

01:30:14.117 --> 01:30:18.037
Is there anything else
you'd like to ask about?

01:30:22.584 --> 01:30:25.711
Pedro.

01:30:26.922 --> 01:30:30.216
