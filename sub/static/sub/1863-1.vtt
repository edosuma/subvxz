Headed to the mines,
more than likely.

01:01:31.047 --> 01:01:33.607
We'd like you to know
we're here to help.

01:01:33.687 --> 01:01:37.521
Please, Jack.
There are eternal
consequences to your actions.

01:01:37.647 --> 01:01:39.285
Lest we be damned.

01:01:40.447 --> 01:01:41.562
Give this town back to us

01:01:41.647 --> 01:01:44.161
and you'll have the
rest of your life to
atone for the sins

01:01:44.247 --> 01:01:46.158
of the life that
you left behind.

01:01:48.487 --> 01:01:50.045
GUERRERO: Defend yourselves.

01:01:51.367 --> 01:01:52.686
Protect your town.

01:01:53.567 --> 01:01:56.764
But any of the
Blackwater boys,
you leave to me.

01:01:57.527 --> 01:01:58.516
(WHISTLES)

01:02:04.247 --> 01:02:05.919
Show me the way
to the mines.

01:02:41.727 --> 01:02:43.763
RED: All right,
all right, all right.

01:02:44.967 --> 01:02:46.639
How we doing
down here, boys?

01:02:47.407 --> 01:02:48.999
I don't think
we can hit 100.

01:02:49.087 --> 01:02:50.884
No, you gotta get
to 200, Washington,

01:02:51.127 --> 01:02:53.322
or you're gonna have
a large-size problem here.

01:02:55.887 --> 01:02:57.559
All right,
everybody listen up,

01:02:58.767 --> 01:03:01.327
we're three months
behind on deliveries

01:03:01.447 --> 01:03:03.005
and he's coming to collect.

01:03:03.367 --> 01:03:06.325
He can help us hack it out
of the goddamned walls
if he wants.

01:03:06.407 --> 01:03:08.284
We have nothing to hide.

01:03:08.367 --> 01:03:11.040
Washington, he's the least
of our problems at this point.

01:03:12.407 --> 01:03:14.318
You tellin' me
the stranger's
still breathin'?

01:03:15.207 --> 01:03:17.926
Yeah, what I'm telling you
is he ain't no damn stranger.

01:03:19.767 --> 01:03:20.961
Who is he?

01:03:22.367 --> 01:03:23.356
He's my brother.

01:03:24.967 --> 01:03:26.241
Yeah, right.

01:03:29.407 --> 01:03:31.125
Close your mouth,
you're drawing flies.

01:03:34.687 --> 01:03:36.166
GUARD 1: Someone's
coming up the road.

01:03:39.207 --> 01:03:40.526
You better identify
yourselves.

01:03:42.807 --> 01:03:44.479
You've got three seconds.

01:03:45.687 --> 01:03:47.040
GUERRERO: One,

01:03:47.447 --> 01:03:48.436
two,

01:03:48.807 --> 01:03:49.796
three.

01:04:00.007 --> 01:04:00.996
All right, he's here.

01:04:02.567 --> 01:04:04.364
All right. Let's go, guys.
Grab your pistols.

01:04:04.447 --> 01:04:05.721
Let's go, boys.
Let's move.

01:04:07.887 --> 01:04:09.684
Come on, fall in.

01:04:10.287 --> 01:04:12.847
Time to kill my
brother. Again.

01:04:35.607 --> 01:04:36.960
(GUNSHOTS)

01:04:40.167 --> 01:04:42.601
RED: Back up.
Back the fuck up
or I'll kill you.

01:04:43.327 --> 01:04:44.362
Back up.

01:04:50.447 --> 01:04:52.005
JUDAH: Now what's
all this then?

01:04:52.607 --> 01:04:54.563
Are we having
a spot of trouble?

01:04:56.127 --> 01:04:57.242
Judah Clark?

01:04:57.327 --> 01:04:58.806
And you brought marshals.
Thank God.

01:04:58.887 --> 01:05:00.161
No, thank me.
GUERRERO: Get down!

01:05:02.047 --> 01:05:03.036
(LAUGHING)

01:05:04.487 --> 01:05:05.806
Hello, Cal.

01:05:06.567 --> 01:05:07.556
Yes,

01:05:08.447 --> 01:05:11.007
I think you should stay
down until all this
gets sorted out.

01:05:11.687 --> 01:05:14.485
Hey, limey!
I just came for Red.

01:05:14.567 --> 01:05:16.319
Why don't you come
and get your boy?
JUDAH: Red,

01:05:16.807 --> 01:05:19.924
is this the fellow that's
been putting your men
on display at the chapel?

01:05:20.007 --> 01:05:22.396
Yeah, but me and the boys
are taking care of it,
obviously.

01:05:22.487 --> 01:05:25.559
Really? Because just
the opposite appears
to be the case.

01:05:25.647 --> 01:05:28.115
I pay you to run this
operation and keep
our interests secure,

01:05:28.207 --> 01:05:30.243
which clearly they are not.
Which begs the question,

01:05:30.407 --> 01:05:31.999
where's my gold?

01:05:32.167 --> 01:05:33.520
Oh, you're gonna
get it, Judah.

01:05:33.607 --> 01:05:34.801
You're gonna get it.

01:05:34.887 --> 01:05:36.320
You're the one
protecting him?

01:05:37.007 --> 01:05:39.646
The federal courts were going
to let the mining rights
revert to Edendale.

01:05:39.727 --> 01:05:42.195
So if I wanted control
of the mine,

01:05:42.567 --> 01:05:44.319
I simply needed
control of the town.

01:05:44.727 --> 01:05:47.605
Mr. Cavanaugh here
provides that control.

01:05:47.687 --> 01:05:49.598
And I...

01:05:50.727 --> 01:05:52.046
I pay off all
the right people.

01:05:53.287 --> 01:05:54.481
So,

01:05:54.567 --> 01:05:56.956
if I don't see every
ounce of my gold,

01:05:57.327 --> 01:05:58.919
I'll take my men

01:05:59.007 --> 01:06:01.396
and leave you in the
predicament in which
I found you.

01:06:01.927 --> 01:06:03.042
Snake,

01:06:03.807 --> 01:06:04.956
come on down here.

01:06:06.487 --> 01:06:07.476
It's here.

01:06:08.007 --> 01:06:09.565
It's here.

01:06:13.047 --> 01:06:14.639
(LAUGHING)

01:06:15.927 --> 01:06:20.205
Well, gentlemen,
we seem to finally have
got our accounts in order.

01:06:20.287 --> 01:06:22.847
Red, my apologies.

01:06:22.927 --> 01:06:24.918
Please allow me to
take care of this
for you.

01:06:25.327 --> 01:06:26.396
Kill them both.

01:06:30.807 --> 01:06:32.320

01:06:59.367 --> 01:07:02.120
Bob, Jim, check it out.

get what you pay for.

01:07:38.247 --> 01:07:39.566
Can I?

01:07:40.647 --> 01:07:41.636
Hell, no.

01:07:42.567 --> 01:07:44.876
We got good equipment
down there.

01:07:46.927 --> 01:07:48.360
Do better.

01:08:09.927 --> 01:08:11.599

01:08:20.966 --> 01:08:21.956

01:08:40.327 --> 01:08:41.316
Do it.

01:08:42.607 --> 01:08:44.438
About time.

01:08:56.647 --> 01:08:58.399

get out of that.

(LAUGHING)

01:09:25.966 --> 01:09:27.161

in there.

01:09:27.247 --> 01:09:28.725
Washington?

01:09:37.727 --> 01:09:38.716
Let's go,
come on.

01:09:40.487 --> 01:09:42.716

hours left. We
need to hurry.

A cigar?

01:10:28.047 --> 01:10:29.366

rid of them.

CALATHEA: That's it!

01:11:00.327 --> 01:11:02.238
We're almost back in town.

01:11:10.247 --> 01:11:11.236
Okay, keep it steady.

01:14:35.327 --> 01:14:36.806

I'm gonna have
to kill her now.

01:14:42.247 --> 01:14:43.680
Unless you come on out.

kills me,

I won't kill her if
you give yourself up.

A man that's good for his word
with a name like Snake.

01:15:39.407 --> 01:15:41.477
You even had a word for it.

01:15:43.007 --> 01:15:44.679
