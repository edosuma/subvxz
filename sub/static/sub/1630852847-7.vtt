the biggest party of the year?

21:54.606 --> 21:56.775
Funny.

21:56.816 --> 21:58.610
Nah, but how did you
get out the house?

21:58.651 --> 21:59.986
Did you pop some sleeping pills
in your dad's coffee?

22:00.028 --> 22:02.030
Stop.
I told him I was hanging out

22:02.072 --> 22:04.491
with Rachel,
which isn't totally a lie.

22:06.076 --> 22:07.327
I'm glad you made it.

22:07.369 --> 22:10.622
Well, I hope me being here
doesn't, you know,

22:10.663 --> 22:12.457
cause trouble with you
and your uncle.

22:12.499 --> 22:13.458
Oh, no,
they're not even here.

22:13.500 --> 22:14.501
They're gone for the weekend.

22:14.542 --> 22:17.587
Yeah, my uncle, your dad,

22:17.629 --> 22:19.381
they'll never know
we were together.

22:19.422 --> 22:21.966
So we can get lit.
- Well, not quite.

22:22.008 --> 22:24.427
Carlton still
doesn't know about us.

22:24.469 --> 22:26.388
I know,
and I'ma tell him.

22:26.429 --> 22:28.682
I promise I will.

22:28.723 --> 22:32.018
But the day he's been having,
timing's just off.

22:32.060 --> 22:33.645
- Hmm.
- So...

22:35.063 --> 22:39.609
Damn, I wish
I could kiss you right now.

22:39.651 --> 22:42.028
What if somebody sees us?

22:43.488 --> 22:45.990
Where is Carlton anyway?
- I don't know.

22:46.032 --> 22:48.159
Somewhere probably sober
on the struggle bus.

22:49.911 --> 22:51.162
Man, I been trying
to get him to have some fun

22:51.204 --> 22:53.623
all night, but every time
I see him, he's alone.

22:53.665 --> 22:55.333
Well, you know
this is really not his crowd.

22:55.375 --> 22:56.584
Yeah, I know.

22:57.961 --> 23:00.422
But I got a little matchmaker
situation going on,

23:00.463 --> 23:02.382
so we'll see.

23:04.509 --> 23:06.011
Okay, wait, right there.

23:06.052 --> 23:07.887
And that, that's my favorite
dance move.

23:07.929 --> 23:09.472
Yo, mine too.

23:09.514 --> 23:12.017
Oh, you are so much cooler
than your rep.

23:12.058 --> 23:13.768
Ooh, what's my rep?

23:14.728 --> 23:16.438
Forget I said anything.

23:16.479 --> 23:18.273
No, no, no.
Come on, I can take it.

23:18.314 --> 23:21.401
Okay.

23:21.443 --> 23:23.153
They say you're
kind of a sell-out.

23:24.779 --> 23:28.324
The friends you hang with,
the drugs you're into,

23:28.366 --> 23:33.913
I mean, you like lacrosse
and yachting and race cars.

23:35.665 --> 23:38.251
Got it, so because I like
what I like,

23:38.293 --> 23:40.086
I'm disqualified
from being Black?

23:40.128 --> 23:41.671
Well, it doesn't help

23:41.713 --> 23:43.757
that you don't make an effort
to get down with us.

23:45.133 --> 23:47.594
Look, you've never even been
to a BSU meeting.

23:47.635 --> 23:50.055
That's not cool.

23:56.061 --> 23:57.437
Enjoy the party, Aisha.

24:30.053 --> 24:33.098
Hey, you got
a lot of love tonight.

24:33.139 --> 24:34.432
I'm proud of you.

24:35.767 --> 24:38.144
You know, if you
were curious about Reid,

24:38.186 --> 24:40.188
all you had to do was ask.

24:40.230 --> 24:41.898
I have nothing to hide.

24:43.233 --> 24:46.361
Look, I trust you completely.
I do.

24:46.403 --> 24:48.655
I know his type.

24:48.697 --> 24:50.532
My instinct's to protect you.

24:52.158 --> 24:56.871
From the big, bad
art gallery owner?

24:58.373 --> 25:02.085
All right, Philip, let's talk.

25:03.294 --> 25:05.130
Radical honesty.

25:07.424 --> 25:08.675
Yes, please.

25:12.303 --> 25:13.221
Shoot.

25:15.056 --> 25:18.226
I do enjoy spending time
with Reid, but do you know why?

25:21.354 --> 25:24.065
He just makes me feel so alive.

25:24.107 --> 25:25.650
And it's not the way
he looks at me.

25:25.692 --> 25:27.652
It's the way
he looks at my art.

25:27.694 --> 25:30.697
Likes it's some rare gift

25:30.739 --> 25:33.950
that I'm depriving the world of
if I don't share it.

25:33.992 --> 25:36.286
And I just love
how that makes me feel.

25:36.327 --> 25:37.746
That's all.

25:38.830 --> 25:41.124
Well, for you, sure,
but for him?

25:41.166 --> 25:42.751
Is it so hard to accept

25:42.792 --> 25:46.421
that someone might actually
believe in my work?

25:49.257 --> 25:51.009
Of course not.

25:53.595 --> 25:58.433
Do you know how many people
over the years have asked me

25:58.475 --> 26:00.310
if I'm ever gonna return
to my art?

26:00.352 --> 26:01.853
But not you.

26:01.895 --> 26:05.690
My own husband has never asked.

26:12.489 --> 26:15.533
Oh! Excuse me.
Y'all need to go.

26:15.575 --> 26:17.035
Yeah, you heard her.

26:17.077 --> 26:18.578
Y'all ain't finna make
no babies up in here.

26:18.620 --> 26:19.996
Come on.
- Okay.

26:21.581 --> 26:23.041
Thank you.

26:27.045 --> 26:29.422
Can you believe that?
- I know, right?

26:29.464 --> 26:32.592
Just making themselves at home.

26:32.634 --> 26:33.885
The nerve.

26:38.139 --> 26:39.599
The audacity.

26:40.725 --> 26:44.020
I mean, this room
isn't even sexy.

26:44.062 --> 26:46.523
I know, right?
Like, you know, it's cool

26:46.564 --> 26:48.900

Kylo, he's at this

27:19.055 --> 27:20.515

27:24.060 --> 27:26.354

No, no, you made that choice
to set your art aside, not me.

27:31.151 --> 27:34.654
Because I was trying to be
the best mother and wife

27:34.696 --> 27:38.366
while still trying to meet all
my deadlines and it was a lot.

27:38.408 --> 27:42.037

at the time.

27:51.171 --> 27:52.130
And now what?

27:56.801 --> 27:59.804
Part of me resents you
for it.

27:59.846 --> 28:02.015
And here I thought
I was making life easier.

28:04.476 --> 28:07.437

Don't do that, Kylo.

30:13.897 --> 30:15.273
I've been blowing
your phone up all day,

30:15.315 --> 30:17.233
and I want
that post removed now.

30:17.275 --> 30:20.820
Look, I know you're upset,
but it genuinely was

30:20.862 --> 30:22.906
never my intention
to be disrespectful.

30:22.947 --> 30:25.658
I was juicing the algorithm,

30:25.700 --> 30:29.245
and honestly, people
are loving the Thirsty Chef.

30:29.287 --> 30:31.790
I don't think she need
that type of love, man.

30:31.831 --> 30:35.043
- This is my friend Jazz.
- 'Sup?

30:36.711 --> 30:38.046
Right.

30:38.088 --> 30:40.090
Have you seen
the Hootsuite analytics?

30:40.131 --> 30:43.593
Honestly, those numbers
are bananas.

30:43.635 --> 30:46.137
Okay, whatever, Kylo,
but I'm not building

30:46.179 --> 30:49.140
an audience off of gimmicks
and clickbait, okay?

30:49.182 --> 30:51.601
I'm here to elevate
the culture, not drag it.

30:51.643 --> 30:53.728
Okay, I hear that.

30:53.770 --> 30:55.438
Look, I'm a disrupter.

30:55.480 --> 30:57.107
That's how I'm always
gonna think.

30:57.148 --> 30:58.483
But if that's not
what you wanted,

30:58.525 --> 30:59.776
then I really am sorry.

30:59.818 --> 31:02.028
Hey, I see you, Thirsty Chef.

31:02.070 --> 31:03.279
Love to see a Black woman

31:03.321 --> 31:05.490
being unapologetic
about her sexuality.

31:05.532 --> 31:08.368
- We need more of that, sis.
- Okay.

31:08.410 --> 31:09.327
Thank you.

31:10.745 --> 31:12.080
Don't look at me.

31:12.122 --> 31:13.957
I swear to God,
I didn't tell them to say that.

31:13.998 --> 31:15.458
I really didn't.

31:15.500 --> 31:18.628
Come on, people love you here.
I can't help it.

31:18.670 --> 31:22.132
I was talking to some bigwigs
earlier from Victoria's Secret,

31:22.173 --> 31:24.634
and they were asking if
I could make an introduction.

31:24.676 --> 31:27.971
I could do that now,
but it's no pressure.

31:28.013 --> 31:30.348
Man, would you just
take the damn video down?

31:31.933 --> 31:32.976
All right.

31:33.018 --> 31:35.937
Actually, it wouldn't hurt

31:35.979 --> 31:39.274
to hear what they have to say,
but just make it quick, Kylo.

31:39.315 --> 31:40.734
Okay?
- Yes, ma'am.

31:40.775 --> 31:42.610
And, Jazz, you could still
get us those drinks.

31:42.652 --> 31:43.862
I'll be right back.

31:44.946 --> 31:46.156
Let's go.

31:46.197 --> 31:47.282
I'll just have
whatever she's having.

31:47.323 --> 31:48.867
- Come on.
- Okay, coming.

31:48.908 --> 31:50.035
I'm gonna introduce you
as the woman

It was sweet of you to throw
this party to build Carlton up.

32:07.469 --> 32:11.139
Except now he feels more
hopeless than he did before.

32:12.515 --> 32:14.559
I just didn't think
it'd be this hard.

32:16.227 --> 32:18.938
He's had a hard time
finding his people.

32:18.980 --> 32:22.400
That feeling of being the only
Black kid is already tough,

32:22.442 --> 32:25.737
and not having a Black
friend group to escape to

32:25.779 --> 32:27.113
makes it even harder.

32:27.155 --> 32:29.574
That just was not
my experience in Philly.

32:29.616 --> 32:31.326
Black school,
Black neighborhood,

32:31.368 --> 32:33.453
Black church, Black everything.

32:35.121 --> 32:37.499
That's not Bel-Air.

32:37.540 --> 32:42.504
Battling every racist comment
and microaggression

32:42.545 --> 32:44.464
gets exhausting.

32:45.298 --> 32:48.176
After a while,
you just start letting it go

32:48.218 --> 32:50.220
and pushing it down.

32:50.261 --> 32:54.432
Yup, taking anxiety pills and...

32:54.474 --> 32:55.934
snorting Xanax.

32:57.602 --> 32:59.521
Shit.

gonna change overnight,
