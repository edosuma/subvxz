00:02.000 --> 00:03.956
Excuse me.

00:04.120 --> 00:05.997
Be with you in a minute.

00:06.160 --> 00:08.628
No, you should have come
last night.

00:08.800 --> 00:10.631
It was fun.

00:10.800 --> 00:13.394
I just have a question.

00:13.560 --> 00:17.030
I know. The margaritas
in that place are so strong.

00:17.200 --> 00:19.270
Hello.

00:19.440 --> 00:21.829
I'd like to buy these huaraches.

00:22.920 --> 00:26.833
So, what else is going on?

00:27.000 --> 00:28.479
Hey!

00:29.280 --> 00:31.953
Listen, I'll call you back.

00:32.560 --> 00:35.518
Yes? What can I do for you?

00:36.600 --> 00:39.034
Nothing. You just lost a customer.

00:41.000 --> 00:47.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:49.400 --> 00:51.152
Ready? I don't wanna miss
the previews.

00:51.320 --> 00:52.958
Me neither. I love the previews.

00:53.120 --> 00:54.951
In fact, I enjoy being
the theatre cutup.

00:55.120 --> 00:59.193
Last week after a preview,
I yelled out, "Must miss!"

00:59.360 --> 01:02.875
I think that I was in that theatre.
That was really funny.

01:03.040 --> 01:04.519
Yeah, I got a good laugh.

01:05.600 --> 01:08.194
Let me just check
my messages before we go.

01:17.600 --> 01:20.160
- So you're on the speed dial?
- After two dates.

01:20.560 --> 01:22.073
- What number?
- Seven.

01:22.240 --> 01:24.037
You know, it's a pain to change that.

01:24.200 --> 01:27.033
You've got to lift up
that plastic thing with a pen.

01:28.720 --> 01:30.392
- Hey, buddy.
- Hey.

01:30.560 --> 01:32.790
Is it all right if I keep these here
for a while?

01:32.960 --> 01:34.871
I'm having a New Year's Eve party.

01:35.040 --> 01:36.951
You're keeping these here
for eight months?

01:37.120 --> 01:41.079
No, Jerry. New Year's Eve, 1999,
the millennium.

01:41.240 --> 01:42.593
I told you about that.

01:42.760 --> 01:45.752
You're gonna leave these chairs here
for two and a half years?

01:46.040 --> 01:47.439
You're not gonna see them.

01:47.600 --> 01:50.990
I got a case of party poppers
I'm gonna keep in front of them.

01:51.800 --> 01:53.074
Hey, so get this.

01:53.240 --> 01:55.959
I got a call this morning
from the Mets' front-office guys.

01:56.120 --> 01:58.509
- They want to take me out to lunch.
- What for?

01:58.680 --> 02:02.434
I'm on a winning ball club, Jerry.
They probably want to pick my brain.

02:02.920 --> 02:05.514
Really, why do you think
they're taking you out to lunch?

02:06.240 --> 02:08.514
I have no idea.

02:08.680 --> 02:11.592
All right, I have had it
with those Mayans.

02:11.760 --> 02:13.079
I don't mind the Mayans.

02:13.240 --> 02:17.313
You know that store, Putumayo?
I was trying to buy these huaraches...

02:17.480 --> 02:20.313
...and this saleswoman
just completely ignored me.

02:20.480 --> 02:21.913
Are we talking huaraches?

02:23.280 --> 02:25.157
I know a great store for huaraches.

02:25.320 --> 02:26.799
No, no, not Putumayo.

02:26.960 --> 02:28.951
No, no, Cinco de Mayo.

02:29.120 --> 02:30.917
Yeah, Marcelino,
he turned me onto it.

02:31.080 --> 02:33.674
And he's 1 l64 Mayan.

02:33.840 --> 02:36.149
I'm starting to get nervous
about this lunch.

02:36.320 --> 02:38.038
What did you have?

02:43.120 --> 02:45.793
Keep these here too, huh?
They'll be all right.

02:45.960 --> 02:49.396
Kramer, these balloons aren't
gonna stay filled until New Year's.

02:49.760 --> 02:53.469
Those aren't for New Year's.
Those are my everyday balloons.

02:57.320 --> 03:00.392
George, we'll be blunt. The Mets need
somebody to head up scouting.

03:00.560 --> 03:02.551
And we think that someone
might be you.

03:02.720 --> 03:04.790
- Head of scouting?
- Interested?

03:05.400 --> 03:07.391
I'm still here.

03:07.920 --> 03:10.992
Unfortunately, league rules
prevent us from making you an offer...

03:11.160 --> 03:12.878
...while you're still under contract.

03:13.040 --> 03:15.235
Do you understand
what we're talking about?

03:15.520 --> 03:17.192
- So you're talking...?
- No, no.

03:17.360 --> 03:19.430
We're not talking.

03:19.600 --> 03:23.115
We're just talking.

03:23.680 --> 03:27.958
- So you need me to get fired?
- We didn't say that.

03:28.120 --> 03:29.917
We couldn't say that. Even if we did...

03:30.080 --> 03:32.674
- We couldn't say that we said it.
- See what we're saying?

03:33.080 --> 03:35.435
But you are still paying
for this lunch?

03:35.600 --> 03:37.238
We didn't say that.

03:41.200 --> 03:43.156
Hi. Sorry I'm late.

03:43.320 --> 03:46.039
There's a lot of chairs
and balloons in my apartment.

03:47.960 --> 03:50.315
How about I make it up
to you with dinner?

03:50.480 --> 03:51.879
Someplace nice this time?

03:52.040 --> 03:54.634
Yeah, I'm sorry about
that Mongolian barbecue last night.

03:54.800 --> 03:56.631
I had heard good things.

03:56.800 --> 03:58.074
I don't know.

03:58.240 --> 04:00.390
It got a two in Zagat's.

04:00.920 --> 04:03.639
Let me just check my messages.

04:03.800 --> 04:06.633
Maybe a nicer girl called.

04:08.040 --> 04:10.156
- Hello.
- Hello?

04:10.320 --> 04:11.799
- Who's this?
- Jane.

04:13.280 --> 04:15.714
- What number did you dial?
- Seven.

04:19.079 --> 04:21.753
Hey! See these?

04:22.520 --> 04:25.273
Cinco de Mayo.

04:25.880 --> 04:29.475
Sales commission, bye-bye-o.

04:39.120 --> 04:41.680
- Good meeting?
- There was no meeting.

04:43.120 --> 04:44.872
But it was quite a meeting.

04:45.040 --> 04:49.033
You are looking at
the next director of Mets scouting.

04:49.200 --> 04:52.033
The only thing is I have to get fired
from the Yankees first.

04:52.200 --> 04:54.760
- You can do that.
- Of course.

04:54.920 --> 04:58.356
But I really want to leave
my mark this time, you know?

04:58.520 --> 05:00.954
I wanna walk away from the Yankees
with people saying:

05:01.120 --> 05:05.033
"Wow! Now, that guy got canned."

05:06.240 --> 05:08.959
So you want to go out
in a final blaze of incompetence.

05:09.520 --> 05:11.909
Remember at Dairy Queen
where I cooled my feet...

05:12.080 --> 05:13.752
...in the soft-serve machine?

05:15.480 --> 05:18.711
Think people will still be using
napkins in the year 2000?

05:18.880 --> 05:22.156
Or is this mouth-vacuum thing
for real?

05:25.480 --> 05:27.436
- So, George.
- Yeah.

05:28.320 --> 05:30.276
I had, like, a so-so date with Valerie.

05:30.440 --> 05:32.556
Now I'm number nine
on the speed dial.

05:32.720 --> 05:34.790
- So?
- So I used to be seven.

05:34.960 --> 05:36.234
I dropped two spots.

05:36.400 --> 05:37.628
What? She's ranking you?

05:37.800 --> 05:40.712
Yeah, the speed dial's like
a relationship barometer.

05:40.880 --> 05:42.472
What is a barometer exactly?

05:42.640 --> 05:45.200
It's pronounced "thermometer."

05:50.800 --> 05:53.837
You know, in the year 2000,
we'll all be on speed dial.

05:54.000 --> 05:56.434
You just think of a person,
they'll be talking to you.

05:56.600 --> 05:59.637
It'll be like,
"I'm getting a call here.

06:01.160 --> 06:02.639
Hey, it's Newman.

06:02.800 --> 06:04.199
Hey, how you doing, Newman?

06:04.360 --> 06:07.352
- I'm not here.
- Oh, you want to talk to Jerry?"

06:12.000 --> 06:14.958
Flowers. You didn't have to do that.

06:15.120 --> 06:20.194
I mean, the dinner and the play
and the hansom cab ride.

06:20.360 --> 06:24.353
Well, I just wanted to... You forgot
the gift certificate to Barnes & Noble.

06:24.520 --> 06:26.238
- you know,
make a good impression.

06:26.400 --> 06:29.517
- I'm gonna go put these in some water.
- I like the way you think.

06:36.120 --> 06:38.714
Oh, my God, number one!

06:38.880 --> 06:42.589
Seinfeld, you magnificent bastard.

06:43.640 --> 06:48.156
Sorry I'm late, but look what I found in
the Yankee Hall of Pride display case.

06:48.320 --> 06:50.231
Isn't that Babe's Ruth uniform?

06:51.080 --> 06:53.878
Is it? Strawberries, anyone?

06:55.520 --> 06:58.398
It's good. Juicy this time of year.

06:59.600 --> 07:00.874
Gotta get the good ones.

07:01.040 --> 07:04.191
Oh, that's bad. That's bad.

07:05.560 --> 07:07.994
Jerry, my millennium party's
really coming together.

07:08.160 --> 07:10.833
Will people be able to breathe
underwater in 2000?

07:11.120 --> 07:12.758
Some of us.

07:13.680 --> 07:15.671
I don't want to exclude anybody.

07:23.600 --> 07:25.318
Shove it.

07:27.160 --> 07:28.354
What is all this?

07:28.520 --> 07:30.431
I got all of this junk
at Cinco de Mayo...

07:30.600 --> 07:32.636
...because I was trying
to show Putumayo...

07:32.800 --> 07:34.313
...how much business they'd lost.

07:34.480 --> 07:36.391
I mean, I've been dancing
and strutting...

07:36.560 --> 07:38.755
...in front of their store for two days.

07:38.920 --> 07:41.639
Oh, no wonder
we're getting so much rain.

07:42.360 --> 07:45.033
Elaine, I'm having a millennium party,
so save the date.

07:45.200 --> 07:49.398
Hey, you know what? Newman sent
me an invitation already to his party.

07:49.560 --> 07:50.834
- Newman?
- Yeah.

07:52.240 --> 07:56.074
"Come celebrate the millennium
with 'Newmannium."'

07:57.040 --> 07:58.234
Newman.

08:02.000 --> 08:03.991
Hi, Valerie.

08:04.160 --> 08:06.913
- You're not Valerie.
- I'm her stepmother.

08:07.560 --> 08:08.754
Drive.

08:10.560 --> 08:14.235
It's taken me 13 years to climb up
to the top of that speed dial...

08:14.400 --> 08:18.075
...and I don't intend
to lose my spot to you.

08:18.680 --> 08:22.275
- But I never...
- You just stay away from that phone.

08:24.680 --> 08:25.954
You wanted to see me, sir?

08:26.120 --> 08:28.031
I heard about what happened
at the meeting.

08:28.200 --> 08:31.317
Yes. I already packed up my desk.
I could be out of here in an hour.

08:31.480 --> 08:34.552
And I have to tell you it's exactly
what this organization needed.

08:35.520 --> 08:37.953
To look to the future,
we've gotta tear down the past.

08:38.120 --> 08:41.590
Babe Ruth was nothing more
than a fat old man with little-girl legs.

08:41.760 --> 08:44.320
And here's something
I just found out recently.

08:44.480 --> 08:47.677
He wasn't really a sultan, huh?
What do you make of that?

08:48.560 --> 08:50.278
Hey, check this out.

08:50.440 --> 08:52.749
Lou Gehrig's pants. Not a bad fit.

08:52.920 --> 08:55.718
You don't think that disease of his
was contagious, do you?

08:55.880 --> 08:58.269
Better take them off.
I'm too important to this team.

08:58.440 --> 09:00.510
Big Stein can't be flopping
and twitching.

09:00.680 --> 09:03.114
Hey, how about some lunch?
What are you going for?

09:07.120 --> 09:11.193
You know, Valerie, I couldn't help
but notice that I'm on your speed dial.

09:11.360 --> 09:12.918
You deserve it.

09:13.080 --> 09:14.433
But I can't help thinking...

09:14.600 --> 09:17.512
...that maybe there's someone
in your life who deserves it more.

09:17.680 --> 09:21.514
Someone you've known,
you know, more than a week.

09:21.680 --> 09:23.955
My stepmother got to you,
didn't she?

09:24.120 --> 09:25.348
What? No.

09:25.520 --> 09:27.556
I can't believe she did this again.

09:28.240 --> 09:32.597
That's it.
She's off the speed dial completely.

09:37.520 --> 09:41.195
Well, I just got your invitation
to the Newmannium party.

09:41.360 --> 09:44.477
You just got it?
Damn, the mail is slow.

09:44.640 --> 09:46.551
You knew I was having
a millennium party...

09:46.720 --> 09:48.915
...but you had to throw yours
on the same day.

09:49.080 --> 09:50.877
I have done nothing unethical.

09:51.040 --> 09:54.191
You have to cancel it, because
I've told everybody about my party.

09:54.360 --> 09:58.114
Cancel? Think again, long shanks.

09:58.280 --> 10:00.794
I started planning this in 1978.

10:00.960 --> 10:04.236
I put a deposit down on that restaurant
that overlooks Times Square.

10:04.400 --> 10:07.358
And I booked Christopher Cross.

10:07.520 --> 10:10.318
Well, what am I gonna do?
I've got over 200 folding chairs...

10:10.480 --> 10:12.311
...and quite a bit of ice.

10:12.480 --> 10:14.550
- What kind?
- Cubed.

10:14.720 --> 10:16.392
That's good stuff.

10:16.560 --> 10:18.949
And you can never have
too much ice.

10:19.120 --> 10:21.031
All right, I'll tell you what I'll do.

10:21.200 --> 10:25.273
You can cohost the party
with me under one condition.

10:25.440 --> 10:28.238
No Jerry. Jerry is not invited.

10:28.400 --> 10:30.231
I got to invite Jerry. He's my buddy.

10:30.400 --> 10:33.836
That he may be, but he's out of my life
starting in the year 2000.

10:34.000 --> 10:38.630
For me, the next millennium
must be Jerry-free.

10:40.560 --> 10:41.913
How could they not fire you?

10:42.080 --> 10:44.036
Never thought I'd fail at failing.

10:44.200 --> 10:45.428
Oh, come on, now.

10:45.840 --> 10:48.638
- Feel like I can't do anything wrong.
- Nonsense.

10:48.800 --> 10:50.631
You do everything wrong.

10:50.800 --> 10:52.358
- Everything?
- Everything.

10:52.520 --> 10:54.590
- You really think so?
- Absolutely.

10:54.760 --> 10:57.274
I have no confidence in you.

10:57.440 --> 10:58.919
All right.

10:59.080 --> 11:01.833
I guess I just have to pick myself up,
dust myself off...

11:02.000 --> 11:03.752
...and throw myself back down again.

11:03.920 --> 11:06.832
That's the spirit. You suck.

11:07.000 --> 11:08.718
I know.

11:09.920 --> 11:12.798
No, no, no, listen to me.
I work in fashion.

11:12.960 --> 11:16.316
Together we can drive
Putumayo out of business...

11:16.480 --> 11:20.837
...and make Cinco de Mayo,
numero uno de Mayo.

11:21.600 --> 11:23.830
Do you need some help
with something?

11:24.720 --> 11:26.312
You? What are you doing here?

11:26.480 --> 11:28.357
I own this store.

11:28.760 --> 11:30.910
No, you don't. You own Putumayo.

11:31.080 --> 11:33.833
Unless you own both stores.

11:35.360 --> 11:37.237
I'm Gladys Mayo.

11:41.520 --> 11:44.796
This really sticks in my craw.

11:48.240 --> 11:51.915
Well, Mrs. Hamilton, it's nice that
you and Valerie patched things up...

11:52.080 --> 11:54.640
...so we could all
get together like this.

11:55.200 --> 11:57.191
Where is Valerie?

11:57.360 --> 11:58.793
I'm sure she'll be along.

11:58.960 --> 12:00.632
Have some wine, Jerome.

12:00.800 --> 12:02.153
Okay.

12:02.320 --> 12:06.996
You know, Jerome, I can understand
what Valerie sees in you.

12:07.160 --> 12:12.678
So attractive, so strong, so comedic.

12:14.320 --> 12:15.833
Good.

12:16.480 --> 12:21.076
Jerome, I have
a deliciously naughty idea.

12:21.680 --> 12:22.954
What?

12:23.760 --> 12:27.036
Why don't I put you
on my speed dial?

12:29.160 --> 12:31.071
I don't know, Mrs. Hamilton.
That doesn't...

12:31.240 --> 12:33.356
Don't be such a child, Jerome.

12:33.520 --> 12:35.636
How's number three sound?

12:35.800 --> 12:38.792
Valerie's not coming over, is she?

12:38.960 --> 12:41.394
- Seven, four, two...
- No.

12:41.560 --> 12:43.152
Stop. Stop. This isn't right.

12:43.320 --> 12:45.880
- What about Valerie?
- I won't tell if you don't.

12:46.040 --> 12:47.519
Oh, my...

12:52.840 --> 12:54.558
Jerry.

12:54.720 --> 12:56.358
Newman.

12:57.160 --> 12:58.354
It's 2000.

12:58.520 --> 13:00.431
Newmannium!

13:06.880 --> 13:08.518
Oh, Jerry.

13:13.360 --> 13:16.796
Yank ees 2, Orioles nothing.
Wait a minute.

13:16.960 --> 13:20.316
A short, stocky, bald man
is streaking across the field.

13:21.040 --> 13:22.268
Oh, my God, George.

13:22.440 --> 13:23.873
Check that. He's not streaking.

13:24.040 --> 13:25.871
He's wearing
a flesh-toned body stocking.

13:26.040 --> 13:30.192
Apparently he's a bit bashful,
and oddly, no one seems upset.

13:30.760 --> 13:32.955
- Kramer, look. It's George.
- Everyone loves him.

13:33.120 --> 13:34.155
Yeah, I know.

13:34.320 --> 13:37.517
Listen, Jerry, I can't let you come
to my New Year's party.

13:37.680 --> 13:39.113
- All right.
- It's killing me.

13:39.280 --> 13:42.955
Newman's got the jump on the invites
and will crush me if I try to go it alone.

13:43.120 --> 13:44.519
- No problem.
- You're right.

13:44.680 --> 13:46.318
I won't do it without you.

13:46.480 --> 13:48.391
Oh, I feel so ashamed
I even thought of it.

13:50.000 --> 13:52.150
Elaine, you can't go
to Newman's Newmannium.

13:52.320 --> 13:54.231
- Okay.
- No, no, no, you've got to spend...

13:54.400 --> 13:56.595
...New Year's 1999
with me and Jerry.

13:56.760 --> 13:58.955
- Fine.
- Oh, come on!

13:59.120 --> 14:00.712
- All right.
- Yes, all right.

14:00.880 --> 14:02.916
So it's you, it's me
and it's Jerry, huh?

14:03.080 --> 14:06.311
Now things are starting to snowball.
I'll tell Newman I don't need him.

14:06.480 --> 14:09.278
So I'll see you two
in the 21 st century.

14:09.440 --> 14:10.793
Okay. Kramer, wait a minute.

14:10.960 --> 14:12.791
- You still have that pricing gun?
- Yeah.

14:12.960 --> 14:15.474
Okay. I need you to help
put Putumayo out of business.

14:16.160 --> 14:17.957
Can do.

14:18.120 --> 14:19.712
What you doing with a pricing gun?

14:20.080 --> 14:25.313
That place is about to have the sale
of the century. Nothing over 99 cents.

14:25.480 --> 14:27.436
Still a rip-off.

14:29.440 --> 14:31.715
- Hello.
- I was just at my stepmom's house...

14:31.880 --> 14:33.996
...and I saw that you were
on her speed dial.

14:34.160 --> 14:37.835
Well, she probably just wanted
to be able to keep tabs on you.

14:38.000 --> 14:39.513
Hold on a second.

14:39.680 --> 14:41.511
- Hello.
- Hi, Jerome.

14:41.680 --> 14:43.432
Mrs. Hamilton,
this is a very bad time.

14:43.600 --> 14:46.797
I've got Valerie on the other line.
Just a second.

14:46.960 --> 14:48.678
- Hello.
- That's her, isn't it?

14:48.840 --> 14:50.910
- Well...
- I don't want you on her speed dial.

14:51.080 --> 14:52.399
Hang on.

14:52.560 --> 14:55.552
She knows about the speed dial.
You gotta get me off this thing.

14:55.720 --> 14:58.439
I won't until she puts me
back on hers.

14:58.600 --> 14:59.953
Hang on.

15:00.120 --> 15:01.758
She wants to be back on yours.

15:01.920 --> 15:04.718
- Fine. But only if you're off hers.
- Hang on.

15:04.880 --> 15:06.279
Fine, if I'm off yours.

15:06.440 --> 15:08.829
- No, still me.
- Sorry, hang on.

15:09.000 --> 15:10.638
Fine, if I'm off yours.

15:10.800 --> 15:14.110
I won't do it. It's my speed dial
and I don't trust her.

15:14.280 --> 15:17.033
Please, Mrs. Hamilton,
this is very awkward for me.

15:17.200 --> 15:18.553
All right.

15:18.720 --> 15:20.995
I'll hide you in one
of the emergency buttons.

15:21.160 --> 15:22.388
Great. Bye.

15:22.560 --> 15:24.790
- She said she'll do it.
- Great.

15:24.960 --> 15:26.279
Hang on.

15:26.440 --> 15:29.034
- Hello.
- Jerry.

15:29.200 --> 15:31.156
I can't get fired.

15:31.320 --> 15:32.912
Hey, Body-Suit Man, what's up?

15:33.080 --> 15:36.117
- Hey, Body-Suit Man.
- Hey, look at that.

15:36.280 --> 15:38.555
- Body-Suit Man.
- Hey!

15:49.360 --> 15:51.271
Hi, I'm H.E. Pennypacker.

15:51.440 --> 15:54.637
I'm a wealthy
American industrialist...

15:54.800 --> 15:57.872
...looking to open a silver mine
in the mountains of Peru.

15:58.040 --> 16:01.237
And before I invest millions
in a lucrative mine...

16:01.400 --> 16:03.436
...l'd like to go a little native.

16:03.600 --> 16:06.751
Get the feel of their condiments,
their unmentionables.

16:06.920 --> 16:11.914
- You know, the real gritty-gritty.
- Well, let me show you what we have.

16:12.080 --> 16:15.516
No, no, I think I can just
browse around on my own.

16:15.680 --> 16:17.432
Machu Picchu.

16:17.600 --> 16:20.797
- Are these free?
- Yeah.

16:30.400 --> 16:32.470
Some of those are women's clothes.

16:32.640 --> 16:34.790
Oh, not a problem.

16:45.200 --> 16:48.795
Attention, Steinbrenner
and front-office morons.

16:48.960 --> 16:51.349
Your triumphs mean nothing.

16:52.040 --> 16:54.110
You all stink.

16:54.280 --> 16:58.751
You can sit on it and rotate!

16:58.920 --> 17:01.832
This is George Costanza.

17:02.000 --> 17:03.353
I fear no reprisal.

17:04.359 --> 17:07.829
Extension 5170.

17:12.240 --> 17:14.151
Come on.
What is taking you so long?

17:14.319 --> 17:16.992
I broke the price gun,
so I had to move to plan B.

17:17.440 --> 17:19.112
- Plan B?
- Yeah.

17:19.280 --> 17:20.759
There is no plan B.

17:20.920 --> 17:24.070
I took these out of every single
garment in the store.

17:24.240 --> 17:26.151
- What?
- They're desiccants.

17:26.319 --> 17:27.673
See, they absorb moisture.

17:27.839 --> 17:31.037
These clothes won't last
five years without them.

17:32.400 --> 17:35.551
- That's not gonna do anything.
- Patience.

17:35.720 --> 17:37.551
- All right, forget it.
- What?

17:37.720 --> 17:40.951
You have screwed me again,
Pennypacker.

17:44.400 --> 17:45.992
Ladies, care for some chips?

17:46.160 --> 17:48.230
Well, I don't mind if I do.

17:53.400 --> 17:56.278
Well, I've changed my mind.

17:56.440 --> 17:59.671
I think I'm going to build
a roller coaster instead.

18:15.640 --> 18:18.313
I heard what you did
in the parking lot, big boy...

18:18.480 --> 18:21.313
...and it is inexcusable.

18:22.560 --> 18:24.312
Personally insulting me, my staff.

18:24.480 --> 18:26.630
I cannot believe that you,
Body-Suit Man...

18:26.800 --> 18:28.756
...could perpetrate
such a disloyal deed.

18:28.920 --> 18:31.559
It breaks my heart to say it.
Who am I kidding? I love it.

18:31.720 --> 18:33.711
- You're...
- Wait! Wait, Mr. Steinbrenner.

18:33.880 --> 18:35.472
George doesn't deserve
any blame...

18:35.640 --> 18:37.756
...for what happened
in the parking lot today.

18:37.920 --> 18:40.957
- lf there's anyone to blame, it's me.
- What are you talking about?

18:41.120 --> 18:43.429
- You popping pills? Got the crazies?
- No, sir.

18:43.600 --> 18:46.910
I ordered George to drive around
insulting people today...

18:47.080 --> 18:50.959
...because I'm tired
of all your macho head games.

18:51.120 --> 18:54.954
He's lying, sir. I'm tired
of all your macho head games.

18:55.120 --> 18:57.714
- Macho head games?
- He's just being loyal to me, sir.

18:57.880 --> 18:59.359
Wilhelm, you're fired.

18:59.520 --> 19:01.670
I owe you an apology,
Body-Suit Man. Streak on.

19:01.840 --> 19:04.673
Now, if you'll excuse me.
I'm not going to the game today.

19:04.840 --> 19:06.990
I'm going to go outside
and scalp some tickets.

19:07.160 --> 19:10.232
Owner's box. That's gotta bring
in 40 bucks, no problem.

19:10.880 --> 19:12.438
Mr. Wilhelm, what was that?

19:12.600 --> 19:13.999
I wanted to get fired.

19:14.160 --> 19:19.871
George, you are looking at the new
head scout of the New York Mets.

19:26.640 --> 19:28.710
I don't know what Elaine
is so upset about.

19:28.880 --> 19:32.919
Without desiccants, those clothes
will be noticeably musty in five years.

19:33.080 --> 19:34.718
She never sees the big picture.

19:39.720 --> 19:42.553
- Hello, Newman.
- Hello, Jerry.

19:43.120 --> 19:44.439
What did you say to Elaine?

19:44.600 --> 19:46.397
I just got her cancellation
in the mail.

19:46.560 --> 19:49.597
Oh, well, I guess she found
someplace better to go.

19:49.760 --> 19:54.595
Well, it's her mistake because she's
going to miss the party of a lifetime.

19:54.760 --> 19:57.399
Well, maybe so,
but come midnight...

19:57.560 --> 20:00.791
...when she's looking for someone
warm and cuddly to kiss...

20:00.960 --> 20:04.714
...I guess you'll be caught between
the moon and New York City.

20:07.040 --> 20:11.477
All right. Come back
to my party, please.

20:12.000 --> 20:14.036
Jerry too, of course.

20:16.360 --> 20:18.555
You don't wanna do your act
or anything, do you?

20:18.720 --> 20:21.359
- No.
- All right, then.

20:21.520 --> 20:26.116
I guess I can accept a little Jerry
if it gets me a lot of Elaine.

20:28.000 --> 20:29.558
- Deal?
- To the Newmannium.

20:29.720 --> 20:31.517
To the "Kramennium."

20:33.400 --> 20:35.231
By the way, Newman,
I'm just curious.

20:35.400 --> 20:39.109
When you booked the hotel, did you
book it for the millennium New Year?

20:39.280 --> 20:41.430
As a matter of fact, I did.

20:41.600 --> 20:43.795
That's interesting,
because as everyone knows...

20:43.960 --> 20:45.393
...since there was no year 0...

20:45.560 --> 20:48.791
...the millennium doesn't begin
until the year 2001...

20:48.960 --> 20:52.157
...which would make your party
one year late...

20:52.320 --> 20:55.676
...and thus quite lame.

21:08.200 --> 21:10.316
I don't feel well at all.

21:10.480 --> 21:14.473
I feel all dried-out inside.

21:14.640 --> 21:16.392
- I'll call for help.
- Okay.

21:21.040 --> 21:22.758
- Hello.
- Who's this?

21:22.920 --> 21:26.037
- It's Jerry. Who's this?
- It's Valerie.

21:26.200 --> 21:27.428
Oh, hi, Valerie, what's up?

21:27.600 --> 21:30.239
I'll tell you what's up.
My stepmother is violently ill...

21:30.400 --> 21:32.960
...so I hit the button for Poison Control
and I get you.

21:33.120 --> 21:36.829
Wow, Poison Control.
That's even higher than number one.

21:39.400 --> 21:41.038
