WEBVTT

00:17.332 --> 00:19.000
Professor Potts here.

00:19.033 --> 00:22.704
It's uh, September 3rd, 1996.

00:22.737 --> 00:25.541
And it's day one at Next Life.

00:26.408 --> 00:27.543
And I will be assisting
Professor Mcrae

00:27.576 --> 00:31.547
in databasing the new batch
of terminally ill subjects

00:31.579 --> 00:32.681
that arrive today.

00:33.915 --> 00:37.585
But the real work of course will
begin

00:37.618 --> 00:39.488
once they start dying off.

00:45.560 --> 00:46.561
So.

00:52.368 --> 00:53.368
Potts again.

00:53.935 --> 00:55.671
The date is November 1st.

00:57.805 --> 01:01.009
We haven't been able to move
forward

01:02.911 --> 01:07.917
as the subjects, they've
um, proven quite resilient.

01:09.117 --> 01:10.318
Yes.

01:10.352 --> 01:13.422
But they did usher in a new
batch of inmates on death row.

01:14.522 --> 01:15.524
So...

01:17.725 --> 01:19.728
Here's to one of them getting
the chair.

01:22.897 --> 01:23.899
Cheers.

01:37.478 --> 01:39.515
It was supposed to be simple.

01:39.548 --> 01:41.751
We scan the energy, they die.

01:41.784 --> 01:44.019
We track them to their next
life.

01:44.052 --> 01:45.922
That's what Professor Mcrae
promised.

01:48.757 --> 01:49.759
But now...

01:52.694 --> 01:53.695
He's gone mad.

01:54.897 --> 01:55.865
He wants to bring them back

01:55.897 --> 01:57.533
once they've been reborn,

01:57.566 --> 01:59.034
show them who they were. It's...

02:02.703 --> 02:04.006
It's unethical.

02:05.540 --> 02:07.777
I don't think I can do it
anymore.

02:09.010 --> 02:10.079
I just can't.

02:12.480 --> 02:13.483
I'm done.

02:17.652 --> 02:18.653
Oh no.

02:19.487 --> 02:20.490
No.

02:26.162 --> 02:28.063
We want justice, we
want peace!

02:28.096 --> 02:30.498
Stop the violence, arrest the
police!

02:30.532 --> 02:32.568
We want justice, we want peace!

02:32.600 --> 02:34.903
Stop the violence, arrest the
police!

02:34.937 --> 02:37.039
We want justice, we want peace!

02:37.072 --> 02:39.442
Stop the violence, arrest the
police!

02:39.474 --> 02:41.609
We want justice, we want peace!

02:41.643 --> 02:43.878
Stop the violence, arrest the
police!

02:43.912 --> 02:46.215
We want justice, we want peace!

02:46.247 --> 02:48.450
Stop the violence, arrest the
police!

02:48.484 --> 02:49.919
We want justice, we want peace!

02:49.951 --> 02:50.953
Right now!

02:52.653 --> 02:53.955
Hey, what are you doing, man?

02:53.989 --> 02:57.193
I ain't do anything man,
I didn't do nothing.

02:57.225 --> 02:59.461
We want justice, we
want peace!

02:59.495 --> 03:01.764
Stop the violence, arrest the
police!

03:01.796 --> 03:03.998
We want justice, we want peace!

03:04.032 --> 03:07.636
Stop the violence, arrest the
police!

05:18.867 --> 05:20.769
Hey, birthday girl.

05:20.802 --> 05:22.004
- Happy bir-
- Thanks, Dad.

05:24.740 --> 05:26.609
Didn't hear you come in last
night.

05:27.809 --> 05:29.679
You're not exactly a light
sleeper.

05:32.113 --> 05:33.114
Lola.

05:34.149 --> 05:35.317
I made you breakfast.

05:37.718 --> 05:39.355
I'm not that hungry.

05:39.387 --> 05:41.789
But you got enough room for
cereal.

05:41.822 --> 05:43.592
I seem to have lost my
appetite.

05:46.327 --> 05:48.162
Lola, wait.

05:48.196 --> 05:49.698
What?

05:49.730 --> 05:50.365
I saw the news last night.

05:50.399 --> 05:51.901
Dad, don't.

05:53.201 --> 05:55.237
Okay, just let me go to school,
all right?

06:00.341 --> 06:03.044
You should have seen their
faces, they were so scared.

06:03.077 --> 06:04.178
What'd you do to them?

06:04.211 --> 06:05.947
What was necessary.

06:05.980 --> 06:06.949
Remind me never to mess with
this one.

06:06.982 --> 06:08.951
This bitch is crazy.

06:08.983 --> 06:10.752
Girl, if you want them to
listen to you

06:10.786 --> 06:12.788
you have to speak to
them in their language.

06:12.821 --> 06:15.090
They're gonna learn to fear
me.

06:15.122 --> 06:17.192
One of them pinned me
down, it fucking hurt.

06:17.225 --> 06:18.360
Are you serious?

06:18.392 --> 06:19.427
Yeah, it's all good.

06:19.461 --> 06:22.264
I threw a molotov at them,
set their asses on fire

06:22.297 --> 06:23.966
so I'd say we're even.

06:23.999 --> 06:25.968
How the hell do you know
how to make a molotov?

06:26.000 --> 06:28.036
Movies, TV, mostly the
internet.

06:28.069 --> 06:30.105
So wait, how did you escape?

06:30.137 --> 06:32.007
I almost didn't.

06:32.040 --> 06:33.042
But I ran like hell.

06:33.809 --> 06:36.211
Seriously, Lola, you
need to watch yourself.

06:36.244 --> 06:37.312
They got cameras everywhere.

06:37.345 --> 06:41.183
Yeah, my face was covered
so they can kiss my ass.

06:41.216 --> 06:43.151
Well my ass wouldn't gotten
caught.

07:04.406 --> 07:05.408
Dad.

07:06.074 --> 07:08.242
I'm sorry about this morning.

07:08.276 --> 07:09.845
It's okay, I get it.

07:10.879 --> 07:11.547
I think.

07:11.579 --> 07:14.782
Honestly, you have no idea.

07:14.815 --> 07:16.484
Care to talk about it?

07:16.517 --> 07:18.053
There she is.

07:19.420 --> 07:21.290
Happy birthday!

07:21.322 --> 07:23.291
Thanks, Mom.

07:23.324 --> 07:24.860
Why'd you bring me a cake?

07:24.892 --> 07:26.762
Dad already baked me one.

07:26.795 --> 07:29.131
I know, I know, but
I brought a good cake.

07:30.064 --> 07:31.233
It has pudding.

07:31.266 --> 07:32.835
Jesus, Mom, what the fuck?

07:32.867 --> 07:34.135
Hey, language.

07:34.168 --> 07:35.937
Oh, let her be.

07:35.971 --> 07:38.006
She doesn't listen to us
anyways.

07:38.038 --> 07:41.776
She does what she wants, when
she wants,

07:41.810 --> 07:43.211
with who she wants.

07:43.245 --> 07:44.280
You bitch.

07:46.447 --> 07:47.449
Look at you.

07:48.850 --> 07:50.352
Quite the actress.

07:50.384 --> 07:51.387
The best.

07:55.357 --> 07:58.093
Sweetheart, you're a
delinquent.

07:58.125 --> 08:00.294
How many times have you been to
jail?

08:00.327 --> 08:01.496
Ava.

08:01.529 --> 08:03.531
It's her birthday.

08:03.564 --> 08:05.901
Yeah mom, it's my fucking
birthday.

08:29.456 --> 08:30.558
Yes?

08:30.591 --> 08:32.026
Is Lola Rose here?

08:33.028 --> 08:34.330
Lola, it's for you.

08:41.235 --> 08:42.237
Lola Rose?

08:43.304 --> 08:44.305
Who's asking?

08:45.407 --> 08:46.408
This is for you.

08:48.909 --> 08:50.077
I don't understand.

08:50.110 --> 08:52.181
Don't worry, you will.

08:58.153 --> 08:59.455
What the fuck?

09:05.025 --> 09:07.328
Thank you for letting me drive
you.

09:07.361 --> 09:10.331
Please, you just need an
excuse to get out of the house.

09:10.365 --> 09:11.899
For what, exactly?

09:11.932 --> 09:14.003
Seriously, just forget it.

09:14.669 --> 09:16.538
Since when do you hold your
tongue?

09:18.907 --> 09:20.341
What is this?

09:20.375 --> 09:22.410
Do you just enjoy being
cruel to your mother?

09:22.443 --> 09:24.612
I'm not a child, okay?

09:24.645 --> 09:25.847
I know things.

09:25.880 --> 09:28.550
Oh, okay, what things, Lola?

09:29.417 --> 09:31.220
What things do you know?

09:31.253 --> 09:32.354
Stop playing dumb.

09:34.923 --> 09:36.991
Fine, if you really wanna
know, I'll tell you.

09:40.562 --> 09:43.132
But I can't 'cause this is me.

09:49.070 --> 09:51.540
A man delivered this to me last
night.

09:51.572 --> 09:53.341
Ooh, are we invited?

09:53.375 --> 09:54.876
I mean, was he cute though?

09:54.909 --> 09:56.978
No, it was not like that,
okay?

09:57.011 --> 09:59.146
Next Life, did you Google
their ass?

09:59.179 --> 10:01.149
Totally off the radar.

10:01.182 --> 10:02.884
Those that don't wanna be
found

10:02.918 --> 10:05.254
are best left alone, believe
that.

10:05.287 --> 10:06.088
That's true.

10:06.120 --> 10:07.121
You're probably right.

10:07.922 --> 10:09.959
But I need to see where this
leads.

11:22.596 --> 11:23.497
Thank you for
calling

11:23.530 --> 11:25.366
Next Life, please hold.

11:25.399 --> 11:27.602
Yes, Professor Mcrae
will be right with you.

11:30.371 --> 11:33.141
You wanted me here, so I'm
here.

11:35.476 --> 11:38.012
Professor, she's here, it's
Lola.

11:38.046 --> 11:39.014
Are you gonna arrest
me?

11:39.047 --> 11:40.014
What, why would we?

11:40.048 --> 11:41.049
My word.

11:43.650 --> 11:46.054
I never thought I'd live to see
the first.

11:47.187 --> 11:48.456
What is this place, huh?

11:49.657 --> 11:50.291
Why am I here?

11:50.325 --> 11:51.994
I will explain everything.

11:55.062 --> 11:56.398
No, no, no, no.

11:56.431 --> 11:58.266
That's impossible.

11:58.298 --> 11:59.100
You're fucking with me, right?

11:59.133 --> 12:01.703
This is all some big fucking
joke.

12:01.735 --> 12:03.404
You're not what I expected.

12:03.437 --> 12:04.472
Why would you say that?

12:04.505 --> 12:09.577
Well, I thought there'd
be more similarities.

12:09.945 --> 12:10.845
If what you say is true,

12:10.879 --> 12:13.481
presuming I believe a single
word of it,

12:13.514 --> 12:15.049
how did you find me?

12:15.082 --> 12:15.750
The odds are-

12:15.783 --> 12:17.385
- Astronomical?

12:17.418 --> 12:19.053
Years ago I would have agreed
with you,

12:19.086 --> 12:22.189
but now, everyone can be
accounted for.

12:22.222 --> 12:23.224
Everyone.

12:24.192 --> 12:25.360
The lenses behind you.

12:35.702 --> 12:38.339
Is something supposed to
happen?

12:38.373 --> 12:43.378
What?

12:43.410 --> 12:44.412
What is this?

12:44.446 --> 12:46.281
Nanotechnology.

12:46.313 --> 12:48.049
Our holy grail.

12:48.082 --> 12:51.552
In 60 seconds it's capable
of scanning your entire body.

12:51.586 --> 12:53.522
The monitors to your left, have
a look.

12:57.158 --> 13:00.796
With this, we can locate anyone,
anywhere.

13:00.828 --> 13:02.663
Its reach is infinite.

13:02.697 --> 13:04.466
How can you do this?

13:04.499 --> 13:06.534
What you're doing is so
violating.

13:06.567 --> 13:08.537
That is not our intention.

13:08.570 --> 13:11.373
It is purely for scientific
research, I can assure you.

13:12.273 --> 13:16.278
Earlier, why did you
say I was the first?

13:16.311 --> 13:19.147
Because, you were the first

13:19.179 --> 13:21.315
to return with an
electromagnetic energy

13:21.349 --> 13:23.585
that had already been accounted
for.

13:23.618 --> 13:25.353
And you're just telling me
this now?

13:25.385 --> 13:27.822
We only just went live.

13:27.855 --> 13:31.092
Come, it's time you two finally
meet.

13:38.832 --> 13:43.738
I will be right outside if you
need me.

14:06.894 --> 14:09.730
I don't know how this works.

14:09.764 --> 14:12.900
I know I'm supposed to tell
y'all

14:12.933 --> 14:14.870
the good about my life.

14:16.471 --> 14:17.538
But then I'd be lying.

14:19.673 --> 14:20.675
It wouldn't be real.

14:22.710 --> 14:27.749
The other night, these two
guys came looking for me.

14:30.552 --> 14:31.620
They wanted me dead.

14:34.254 --> 14:35.256
And I'm scared.

14:40.562 --> 14:43.698
And I don't know if I'm gonna
make it.

14:45.567 --> 14:49.904
Which is why you need to hear
everything I have to tell you.

14:55.677 --> 14:57.312
I'm Robbie Stinson.

14:59.947 --> 15:01.316
And this is my story.

15:38.686 --> 15:41.456
What you
clocking that mile at now?

15:41.489 --> 15:42.657
6.30.

15:42.690 --> 15:45.860
Haha, I was doing five back
when that meant something.

15:45.893 --> 15:47.829
Pssh, I need proof of that,
move over.

15:48.895 --> 15:49.764
Always in the way.

15:49.797 --> 15:50.798
Okay.

15:52.399 --> 15:55.669
So you messing
with me?

15:55.702 --> 15:57.238
Hmm, you messing with me?

15:57.272 --> 15:58.240
Come on now, come on.

15:58.273 --> 15:59.307
What you got, what you got?

15:59.340 --> 16:01.610
No you old, come on.

16:01.643 --> 16:02.509
What it is?

16:02.543 --> 16:03.378
I gotta go to school,

16:03.410 --> 16:04.678
- come on.
- I know you do.

16:04.711 --> 16:06.314
That's right, you better run.

16:07.014 --> 16:08.482
I might've knocked you out.

16:08.515 --> 16:09.985
What'd I do with my coffee?

16:11.686 --> 16:12.854
I need proof.

16:13.788 --> 16:14.789
Okay.

16:16.724 --> 16:19.628
Can you believe my mom
grounded me?

16:19.660 --> 16:21.495
Yes, yes I can actually.

16:21.528 --> 16:22.730
She can't do that.

16:22.764 --> 16:24.032
She just can't.

16:24.065 --> 16:26.801
What exactly did you do this
time?

16:26.833 --> 16:28.936
Uh, I'd rather not say.

16:28.970 --> 16:30.839
Then why did you bring it up?

16:30.871 --> 16:32.406
I don't... guilty conscience,
man?

16:32.440 --> 16:33.442
I don't know.

16:35.076 --> 16:37.778
Okay, look, I spied on the
neighbor again.

16:37.812 --> 16:38.879
It's no big deal.

16:40.014 --> 16:41.383
Yeah, that's real funny.

16:42.116 --> 16:43.951
Hey look, you didn't see what I
saw.

16:43.985 --> 16:45.052
- Okay?
- Gene!

16:45.086 --> 16:46.955
Miss Baker's pushing 50, bro.

16:46.988 --> 16:48.890
That's just wrong.

16:48.923 --> 16:50.625
Yeah, well she should
close her blinds then.

16:50.658 --> 16:51.993
That's just wrong.

16:52.025 --> 16:53.027
Ah.

16:54.095 --> 16:57.565
Hey, um, you going down to the
recruitment office next week?

16:57.597 --> 16:58.732
What?

16:58.765 --> 17:00.334
I... dude, I'm grounded.

17:00.368 --> 17:02.003
I literally just told you that.

17:02.035 --> 17:02.703
Yeah.

17:02.736 --> 17:04.038
Dude come on, you know my mom,

17:04.072 --> 17:06.508
she's always up my ass.

17:06.540 --> 17:08.643
I tell her I wanna leave town,

17:08.675 --> 17:10.377
smack me upside my head.

17:10.411 --> 17:12.681
Now, if you tell her,
that's a different story.

17:12.713 --> 17:14.048
She's got a thing for you.

17:14.082 --> 17:16.318
So, maybe you can ask her?

17:17.050 --> 17:18.052
Hey!

17:18.920 --> 17:20.055
You guys need a ride?

17:20.087 --> 17:21.088
Oh, no thanks,

17:21.122 --> 17:22.557
- we're kind of in the-
- Gene!

17:22.589 --> 17:23.724
What are you doing?

17:23.758 --> 17:24.759
Well I was.

17:25.859 --> 17:26.861
Oh, you.

17:28.462 --> 17:29.931
Gene, you're killing me, bro.

17:31.632 --> 17:32.801
Okay.

17:32.834 --> 17:34.736
To be fair, that... that

17:36.971 --> 17:38.472
That's, that's fair.

17:49.116 --> 17:51.485
Professor MaCrae, Omega
Division.

17:53.421 --> 17:54.423
Yes.

17:55.556 --> 17:56.924
Have they accepted our offer?

17:59.794 --> 18:00.796
Wonderful.

18:01.429 --> 18:03.632
How soon before they send our
subjects?

18:04.999 --> 18:06.701
Good, prep them.

18:08.035 --> 18:10.005
I shall be there first
thing in the morning.

18:13.740 --> 18:16.077
Wow, look at you, on time and
shit.

18:16.943 --> 18:17.945
Bravo!

18:18.746 --> 18:20.649
I ain't your goddamn
chauffeur.

18:25.819 --> 18:27.087
You take care of your Uncle
Russ?

18:27.121 --> 18:28.123
He's coming along.

18:30.991 --> 18:32.659
Why do I smell bullshit?

18:32.692 --> 18:33.694
He wants a cut.

18:34.528 --> 18:35.163
What?

18:35.195 --> 18:36.397
25 fucking percent.

18:37.097 --> 18:38.665
Fuck!

18:38.699 --> 18:41.370
Fuck, I really need that money,
Cliff.

18:43.671 --> 18:45.106
How am I supposed to leave now?

18:52.712 --> 18:53.714
Hey, Robbie!

18:56.049 --> 18:57.051
You need a lift?

18:58.085 --> 19:00.422
We got some space in the back.

19:00.454 --> 19:02.823
No seatbelts, but we got some
rope that's nice and tight!

19:06.193 --> 19:07.729
We can't keep doing this.

19:07.761 --> 19:09.029
Speak for yourself.

19:10.998 --> 19:13.902
I mean you could totally
whoop their asses, man.

19:13.934 --> 19:14.903
Why is this necessary?

19:14.935 --> 19:17.004
No, if I do that, they
just keep coming back.

19:17.038 --> 19:20.974
Okay then, you rinse and you
repeat.

19:21.008 --> 19:22.477
Gene, why you even running?

19:22.509 --> 19:24.479
They're not after you, they're
after me.

19:24.511 --> 19:28.549
I don't know man, I
see you run then I run

19:28.583 --> 19:30.485
because we're a team.

19:30.518 --> 19:34.523
Gene and Robbie against
the world, it's us.

19:35.990 --> 19:37.057
How about I race you home?

19:37.090 --> 19:38.625
Oh god, no.

19:38.659 --> 19:40.061
Let's just walk.

19:40.094 --> 19:41.229
Please?

19:41.261 --> 19:45.533
Come on, walk at a brisk pace,
okay.

19:56.076 --> 19:57.913
Can I get you
anything else?

19:58.846 --> 19:59.847
Slow night.

20:02.282 --> 20:03.917
Lovely, isn't it?

20:03.951 --> 20:06.688
Yeah, not when you need the
tips.

20:08.955 --> 20:12.760
How would you like to
volunteer for a survey?

20:14.862 --> 20:16.698
It pays quite well.

20:26.207 --> 20:28.944
Roger, roger, this is Gene,
over.

20:33.013 --> 20:36.550
Contacting anyone affiliated
with Gene and the gang.

20:40.922 --> 20:43.958
Come on Robbie, just talk to me,
dude.

20:43.990 --> 20:45.594
Fletcher, is that you?

20:46.993 --> 20:49.263
Oh, god, Is this Lonnie
Dawkins?

20:49.297 --> 20:52.000
You little shit, what are
you doing on this channel?

20:52.032 --> 20:54.935
I told you next time I was
gonna tell your mother.

20:54.969 --> 20:56.671
Kiss my ass,
Fletcher.

20:58.172 --> 20:59.941
Hey Lonnie, listen, bud.

20:59.973 --> 21:03.043
You're talking to the two
time spelling bee champion

21:03.076 --> 21:04.512
of the district.

21:07.048 --> 21:09.817
I can't believe
they signed off for this.

21:09.849 --> 21:11.718
Waiting for people to die.

21:11.751 --> 21:13.654
They better hope this doesn't
get out.

21:14.288 --> 21:17.125
They have no idea what's
on the other side.

21:21.729 --> 21:24.132
The other side?

21:24.164 --> 21:26.000
The other side, the other side.

21:26.032 --> 21:28.068
No.

21:28.102 --> 21:29.137
No!

21:29.170 --> 21:30.572
The other side!

21:31.238 --> 21:33.041
Oh my god, I knew it.

21:34.240 --> 21:36.044
Oh, what's happening?

21:40.013 --> 21:40.981
Mom, it's happening!

21:41.015 --> 21:43.184
Gene, you're gonna have
to save the world, man.

21:45.286 --> 21:46.288
I can't do it alone.

21:47.188 --> 21:48.623
God, I gotta call Robbie.

22:02.636 --> 22:03.571
Hey Robbie.

22:03.605 --> 22:05.940
You know that truck
out there need washing.

22:05.972 --> 22:07.274
I just washed it like two days
ago.

22:07.307 --> 22:08.943
Why I do I gotta wash it again
for?

22:50.451 --> 22:51.653
No.

22:54.320 --> 22:55.322
No!

22:56.390 --> 22:58.259
This cannot be happening!

23:14.842 --> 23:16.978
Oh my, Robbie.

23:17.010 --> 23:18.445
Again with the truck?

23:18.479 --> 23:19.913
You don't even drive.

23:19.946 --> 23:21.448
What do you want, Gene?

23:21.481 --> 23:23.451
Pow wow at my place, okay?

23:23.483 --> 23:25.218
It's not safe outside.

23:25.251 --> 23:27.754
The Fed's got ears everywhere.

23:27.788 --> 23:28.789
What?

23:29.523 --> 23:33.760
It's not safe outside, the
Fed's got ears everywhere.

23:33.794 --> 23:34.395
Gene, this better be good.

23:34.428 --> 23:35.430
It's so good.

23:36.262 --> 23:38.066
It's so good, come on.

23:46.006 --> 23:47.942
I wouldn't bullshit you, Robbie.

23:48.608 --> 23:50.177
I think you're overreacting.

23:50.211 --> 23:52.279
Okay, you wanna know what I
think?

23:52.313 --> 23:55.182
I think it came from that
military base outside of town.

23:55.215 --> 23:57.050
That place doesn't even have an
entrance.

23:57.084 --> 24:00.922
Now think about it, unmarked
vans coming and going,

24:00.954 --> 24:03.490
walls of defenses built so
frickin high

24:03.523 --> 24:05.992
to keep the inquiring minds at
bay.

24:06.026 --> 24:07.028
Like me.

24:09.262 --> 24:11.732
Now that place is clearly up to
something.

24:13.134 --> 24:14.134
Oh, shit!

24:15.502 --> 24:16.471
What?

24:16.503 --> 24:17.904
Well obviously that's
the doorbell, Robbie.

24:17.938 --> 24:19.307
Someone's at the door.

24:20.240 --> 24:21.241
Ugh, oh god.

24:23.144 --> 24:25.246
Oh my gosh, and would you stop
leaving

24:25.278 --> 24:27.214
your sweaty shirts in my room?

24:27.248 --> 24:28.883
I'm tired of burning incense in
here

24:28.915 --> 24:30.217
to mask that stench.

24:31.118 --> 24:32.953
like a Catholic church in here,
Robbie.

24:31.249 --> 24:34.221
It's starting to smell

24:34.221 --> 24:36.758
Look, just let you mother get
that.

24:36.790 --> 24:40.227
Robbie, do you want me
to tear my mother away

24:40.260 --> 24:42.930
from Jose Padilla's game of
wheels?

24:42.962 --> 24:44.331
Just go get the door.

24:44.365 --> 24:45.799
You don't know the show.

24:46.834 --> 24:48.769
You're so annoying, Robbie.

24:53.140 --> 24:54.075
Sorry, but we're atheists, so.

24:54.107 --> 24:56.409
No, no, wait, wait, please.

24:56.442 --> 24:58.913
My car broke down and
I'm already running late.

24:58.945 --> 25:00.080
Late, late for what, huh?

25:00.114 --> 25:01.481
Give me some answers, old man.

25:01.515 --> 25:03.485
I just need a phone call.

25:05.519 --> 25:07.454
Will you help me or not?

25:10.290 --> 25:11.525
Robbie.

25:11.558 --> 25:14.095
I'm telling you, I heard
too much last night.

25:14.127 --> 25:14.995
He's one of them.

25:15.028 --> 25:16.263
You need to let that go

25:16.297 --> 25:17.131
He's not-

25:17.163 --> 25:17.999
- No!

25:18.031 --> 25:19.266
No, no!

25:19.299 --> 25:21.469
This is just a minor setback!

25:21.501 --> 25:23.403
Do not begin the new trials.

25:23.436 --> 25:25.472
I need to see the new batch!

25:26.840 --> 25:28.241
I don't care!

25:28.275 --> 25:29.277
Let them wait!

25:30.544 --> 25:31.979
I will be there tonight!

25:40.988 --> 25:43.356
I thought you needed a
mechanic.

25:43.390 --> 25:44.392
Yes.

25:45.893 --> 25:46.894
Among other things.

25:47.694 --> 25:49.496
Hey, so what's on the other
side?

26:03.176 --> 26:04.244
Remember this name.

26:05.546 --> 26:06.514
Change is coming.

26:07.513 --> 26:08.515
For all of us.

26:09.282 --> 26:13.253
Imagine a world where
death is no longer the end

26:13.287 --> 26:16.090
of our story, but just the
beginning.

26:17.223 --> 26:19.393
One day you'll look back on this
moment,

26:19.425 --> 26:20.928
and you'll remember.

26:21.595 --> 26:24.164
That is when I met him.

26:25.633 --> 26:28.469
Knew him before.

26:30.436 --> 26:31.404
Before what?

26:31.438 --> 26:33.474
Before he changed the world.

26:41.147 --> 26:41.981
Man, that guy was crazy.

26:42.016 --> 26:45.186
Pff, he's just gonna change the
world.

26:45.219 --> 26:47.221
Hey, you never know.

26:48.321 --> 26:49.456
Anything's possible.

26:49.490 --> 26:51.159
No, that guy was full of shit.

26:53.326 --> 26:55.195
Okay Gene, whatever
you say.

26:55.229 --> 26:56.963
What, are you leaving?

26:56.997 --> 26:58.600
Yeah, I'm out, man.

27:43.009 --> 27:44.444
I miss you so much.

27:55.122 --> 27:58.125
What couldn't you have a next
life life?

28:04.431 --> 28:06.667
Why did you have to leave me
soon?

28:08.268 --> 28:10.038
Hey, Robbie, I was...

28:11.005 --> 28:12.006
You okay?

28:13.307 --> 28:15.442
You ever have any regrets?

28:17.277 --> 28:18.278
Some.

28:20.013 --> 28:21.014
You?

28:21.781 --> 28:23.384
I just never had the chance.

28:24.484 --> 28:25.485
I was just a kid.

28:28.321 --> 28:30.290
I never thought she wouldn't be
around.

28:33.359 --> 28:35.729
I never told her I love her.

28:35.762 --> 28:40.000
It doesn't matter what you
said or didn't say, Robbie.

28:40.034 --> 28:41.502
You gave her strength.

28:41.535 --> 28:46.040
To her dying breath she
would pray and pray,

28:46.073 --> 28:47.375
just one more day with him.

28:48.608 --> 28:50.110
Just let me see my son.

29:01.188 --> 29:02.190
It hurts.

29:28.382 --> 29:29.384
Hey there, Robbie.

29:30.050 --> 29:33.119
You weren't just trying
to avoid me, were you?

29:33.153 --> 29:35.556
Hey, hey, hey, I was talking to
you.

29:36.490 --> 29:37.157
I thought we were friends.

29:37.191 --> 29:38.526
Why are you doing this, Kenny,

29:38.558 --> 29:40.827
this isn't-

29:40.861 --> 29:42.463
You got two options.

29:42.496 --> 29:44.432
Either you get up and fight me
back,

29:45.499 --> 29:47.168
or my personal favorite lights
out.

29:47.201 --> 29:48.501
What's it gonna be?

29:48.535 --> 29:50.204
No.

29:50.237 --> 29:51.572
I'm not fighting you, Kenny.

29:55.209 --> 29:55.843
You're gonna change your mind

29:55.875 --> 29:57.412
one of these days, man.

30:19.432 --> 30:22.869
I used to get this all the time
when I wouldn't go to sleep.

30:22.903 --> 30:25.172
My daddy said he was the sandman

30:25.204 --> 30:27.074
and I almost believed him.

30:31.711 --> 30:33.314
Welcome to my world, Robbie.

31:38.778 --> 31:39.747
Hey!

31:41.548 --> 31:42.616
Stop running!

31:46.486 --> 31:47.321
Kenny!

31:47.354 --> 31:49.590
Hop on, hop on.

31:49.623 --> 31:50.624
You get back
here,

31:50.656 --> 31:52.659
you little son of a bitch!

31:52.692 --> 31:53.693
Goddamit, boy!

31:53.727 --> 31:55.530
You are gonna regret this.

32:01.300 --> 32:03.770
Wow, your room is so cool.

32:03.804 --> 32:04.638
I'm Kenny.

32:04.671 --> 32:05.305
I'm Robbie.

32:05.338 --> 32:06.740
Thanks for saving my life.

32:06.772 --> 32:07.774
Yeah, no sweat.

32:09.609 --> 32:11.411
Why did your dad do that?

32:11.444 --> 32:12.745
My daddy drinks too much

32:12.778 --> 32:14.548
so I took all his beer caps.

32:14.580 --> 32:16.849
Had to use my teeth on this one.

32:16.883 --> 32:18.686
Guess he didn't like me doing
that.

32:19.385 --> 32:20.854
You want my dad to talk to
him?

32:20.886 --> 32:22.889
No, that'll just make him
madder.

32:38.372 --> 32:39.673
Down goes Frazier!

32:41.441 --> 32:44.577
Aha, there you go boy,
just like I taught you.

32:44.611 --> 32:46.814
But you gotta move them
feet a little bit, man.

32:46.846 --> 32:48.883
You gotta dance around
a little bit, come on!

32:50.483 --> 32:52.285
What's wrong, man?

32:52.318 --> 32:54.288
Is this about the farm
boy with the chicken coop

32:54.320 --> 32:55.923
that egged my truck?

32:55.955 --> 32:58.791
Okay, I get it, you're a grown
man,

32:58.825 --> 33:00.326
you do what you want.

33:00.359 --> 33:01.494
All right, what do I know?

33:01.528 --> 33:03.329
I only been around the block and
back-

33:03.363 --> 33:04.965
- Just wasting your time, Pops.

33:04.998 --> 33:06.667
But it ain't gotta be that
way, Robbie.

33:06.700 --> 33:08.635
All you gotta do is talk to me.

33:08.669 --> 33:09.536
I just need to get outta here!

33:09.568 --> 33:10.471
Out of what?

33:10.503 --> 33:11.671
Out of the house?

33:11.704 --> 33:12.538
I mean you're still-

33:12.571 --> 33:14.375
- Out of this town.

33:14.407 --> 33:16.509
Out of this state, if I
can just enlist already-

33:16.542 --> 33:17.577
- And do what?

33:17.611 --> 33:18.613
You gonna run?

33:20.980 --> 33:22.282
Is that what you think the army
wants?

33:22.316 --> 33:24.585
Soldiers who can't face the
enemy?

33:24.617 --> 33:25.685
It's different though, man.

33:25.719 --> 33:26.886
The hell it is, Robbie.

33:26.920 --> 33:28.022
It's the same damn thing!

33:28.055 --> 33:29.722
I can't do this no more,
aight?!

33:29.756 --> 33:31.425
I'm tired!

33:31.458 --> 33:32.593
I'm tired!

33:33.593 --> 33:35.429
I run, he chases me down.

33:35.461 --> 33:37.830
I stand my ground, he knocks me
on my ass!

33:37.864 --> 33:39.365
And I take that shit!

33:39.398 --> 33:41.268
I take that shit, man!

33:42.669 --> 33:44.872
And I stay out of trouble
like you taught me.

33:45.771 --> 33:47.474
Like you taught me, man.

33:49.809 --> 33:51.912
And I put my head down and I
ride it out.

33:53.680 --> 33:54.682
That's me, man.

33:57.384 --> 33:57.985
That's me.

33:58.018 --> 33:58.951
I know.

33:58.984 --> 33:59.986
No, that's me.

34:00.854 --> 34:03.591
Every damn day that's me.

34:04.490 --> 34:05.592
I get that from you.

34:05.625 --> 34:06.859
I know.

34:06.893 --> 34:08.695
- I get that from you.
- I know.

34:08.728 --> 34:09.696
I miss my mom, man.

34:09.730 --> 34:11.965
I know you do 'cause I do too.

34:11.998 --> 34:13.434
What I'm going
through.

34:13.467 --> 34:14.802
I know.

34:14.835 --> 34:15.802
It's hard, man.

34:15.835 --> 34:16.836
I know.

34:19.005 --> 34:20.007
I know, man.

34:47.768 --> 34:50.036
So that's it, huh?

34:50.070 --> 34:51.038
You think running away from this
shit's

34:51.070 --> 34:52.405
gonna change anything?

35:00.179 --> 35:01.948
Your ass ain't going nowhere.

35:01.981 --> 35:04.150
You're staying right where you
belong.

35:04.184 --> 35:06.086
These are our stomping grounds,
Kenny.

35:07.521 --> 35:08.989
You don't just walk away from
that.

35:09.889 --> 35:13.160
But you know what, you
do what you gotta do.

35:13.193 --> 35:15.095
If you wanna run, fucking run!

35:15.128 --> 35:16.130
Even if it does make you look

35:16.163 --> 35:19.532
like a little bitch.

35:21.668 --> 35:22.903
You know what I think?

35:22.936 --> 35:24.472
I think you need to get laid.

35:28.775 --> 35:29.943
Hey, hey, hey, look.

35:29.976 --> 35:33.079
See that chick right there,
the bitch who cuts herself?

35:33.112 --> 35:34.480
She's fucking drunk,
man.

35:34.514 --> 35:35.315
Even better!

35:35.347 --> 35:35.882
- Fuck you, man.
- Man, just go down-

35:35.916 --> 35:37.951
- I said no, goddamit!

35:37.983 --> 35:39.152
What's the matter?

35:39.186 --> 35:40.687
You can't get it up?

35:40.719 --> 35:42.188
That's a bad look, Kenny.

35:42.222 --> 35:44.490
Damn you, Cliff.

35:59.172 --> 36:00.507
Um, Mitch.

36:00.539 --> 36:01.808
Yeah, baby.

36:01.842 --> 36:03.644
A boy just walked in.

36:03.677 --> 36:04.678
Shit.

36:05.612 --> 36:06.914
Kenny?

36:06.947 --> 36:08.715
Don't you touch my fucking beer!

36:14.221 --> 36:15.521
Why don't you worry
about that nasty bitch

36:15.554 --> 36:16.890
you dragged in and fuck off?

36:21.795 --> 36:22.695
Hey!

36:22.728 --> 36:23.931
Agh!

36:36.742 --> 36:38.644
I'm getting too old for this,
Kenny.

36:38.677 --> 36:39.813
You should know by now.

36:46.920 --> 36:48.088
Hey, my mom's got bingo
tonight,

36:48.121 --> 36:50.023
so do you wanna go half on a
pizza?

36:50.056 --> 36:51.458
We can split the,

36:52.159 --> 36:54.494
oh shoot, Robbie, look, look.

36:56.195 --> 36:58.132
Look, look, look, look.

36:58.831 --> 37:00.067
Well, he got what he deserved.

37:00.099 --> 37:02.536
Yeah he most certainly did.

37:02.568 --> 37:04.003
What time do you wanna meet
up?

37:04.036 --> 37:04.904
Uh, let's do five.

37:04.938 --> 37:06.974
No, no, no, no, 5:30.

37:07.007 --> 37:08.275
Wait, maybe like wait,

37:08.307 --> 37:09.842
- no, because I-
- Wait, Gene.

37:09.876 --> 37:11.812
Let me do the talking.

37:11.844 --> 37:13.212
Hey.

37:13.246 --> 37:14.681
I'm Robbie, and this is my
friend-

37:14.713 --> 37:15.982
- Gene, I'm Gene.

37:16.016 --> 37:17.150
Hello, ladies.

37:17.182 --> 37:18.851
Nice to meet you, I'm Janice.

37:18.885 --> 37:19.719
Nancy.

37:19.753 --> 37:21.688
So does that free ride still
stand?

37:21.721 --> 37:22.556
Of course.

37:22.588 --> 37:23.590
Hop in.

37:24.123 --> 37:25.224
I got Nancy.

37:25.257 --> 37:26.125
You mind if I sit?

37:26.159 --> 37:27.795
Of course, it's all you.

37:33.567 --> 37:34.568
Coming in hot.

37:36.769 --> 37:37.971
So, Robbie, I've seen you
around school

37:38.003 --> 37:39.639
you keep a low profile.

37:40.407 --> 37:43.076
Yeah, just trying to
ride things out, you know,

37:43.108 --> 37:43.942
stay out of trouble.

37:43.976 --> 37:46.045
Then you better watch out for
Janice.

37:46.079 --> 37:48.048
She's nothing but trouble.

37:48.081 --> 37:50.182
She's not wrong.

37:50.215 --> 37:51.617
Yeah.

37:51.650 --> 37:52.284
Which one of y'all play?

37:52.318 --> 37:54.320
I saw the guitar back there.

37:54.353 --> 37:56.122
Take a wild guess.

37:56.155 --> 37:57.858
I mean, obviously,

37:57.891 --> 37:58.791
I beg to differ.

37:58.826 --> 38:01.628
See, Janice seems like the
obvious choice.

38:01.661 --> 38:03.797
She's flirtatious, gives rides

38:03.829 --> 38:07.000
to strangers, probably
promiscuous.

38:07.032 --> 38:08.568
This is why I can't have
friends.

38:08.601 --> 38:10.103
Definitely kisses on the first
date.

38:10.135 --> 38:11.538
Case closed, right?

38:12.237 --> 38:13.038
No!

38:13.072 --> 38:17.010
Then there's Nancy, the ordinary
one.

38:17.043 --> 38:19.913
I can only imagine what goes
on in that head of hers.

38:19.945 --> 38:22.214
Uh oh Janice, should we tell
him?

38:22.248 --> 38:24.318
No, let's let him
keep his little fantasy.

38:24.351 --> 38:26.186
Yeah, look, I got a knack

38:26.219 --> 38:27.921
for figuring people out, okay?

38:27.954 --> 38:28.889
I bet when she goes home

38:28.922 --> 38:31.157
she's gonna write a song about
me, Robbie.

38:31.190 --> 38:32.024
Oh really?

38:32.057 --> 38:32.726
Mhmm, yeah.

38:32.759 --> 38:34.728
And what would it be about?

38:34.760 --> 38:36.896
Hell if I know, I don't
songwrite.

38:36.929 --> 38:41.034
Sorry Gene,
the guitar is all me.

38:42.268 --> 38:43.269
Shit.

38:44.070 --> 38:45.639
You sing too?

38:45.672 --> 38:47.574
Oh yeah, like a rockstar.

38:51.911 --> 38:53.146
Look who came through.

38:54.146 --> 38:55.181
About damn time.

39:01.954 --> 39:02.956
Well?

39:03.824 --> 39:05.826
Hey I didn't drive my happy
ass all the way over here

39:05.858 --> 39:07.193
to watch you dick around.

39:07.226 --> 39:09.163
You gonna check this shit out or
what?

39:20.340 --> 39:21.775
You get a jab in at least?

39:23.043 --> 39:24.811
Mind your fucking business,
man.

39:28.947 --> 39:30.216
Test these out if they work?

39:30.250 --> 39:32.085
I just got 'em!

39:32.117 --> 39:32.952
When was I supposed to have the
time

39:32.985 --> 39:33.819
to take these things out-

39:33.853 --> 39:34.887
- Shut up, shh.

39:36.789 --> 39:37.791
I got an idea.

39:40.025 --> 39:41.761
If you could go anywhere in
the world,

39:41.795 --> 39:43.130
where would you go and why?

39:43.163 --> 39:43.996
Oh that's easy.

39:44.030 --> 39:45.832
Far from my mother.

39:45.864 --> 39:46.799
Next.

39:46.833 --> 39:49.235
Honestly, anywhere
else but here, you know?

39:49.268 --> 39:50.102
Ouch.

39:50.135 --> 39:50.971
Are we that boring?

39:51.003 --> 39:52.405
Explain yourself.

39:52.438 --> 39:54.141
No, that's not what I meant.

39:54.173 --> 39:56.976
What, what I meant was, from
this town.

39:57.010 --> 39:58.012
You know, I just...

39:59.244 --> 40:00.846
This place isn't me, you know?

40:00.880 --> 40:01.882
Mhmm, I feel you.

40:03.115 --> 40:04.784
Nice save.

40:04.818 --> 40:06.186
Hey, Robbie, why don't you join
me

40:06.219 --> 40:07.320
for a game of foosball?

40:07.353 --> 40:08.320
See what you're really made of.

40:08.353 --> 40:11.123
I mean if you wanna
lose, we can do that.

40:11.157 --> 40:13.827
Oh, that's very sweet, but I
never lose.

40:13.860 --> 40:15.762
Huh, okay.

40:22.367 --> 40:24.704
Hey, you like foosball?

40:24.737 --> 40:27.039
You know there's another table
over there

40:27.072 --> 40:28.808
- if you wanna play.
- Um, thanks but

40:28.842 --> 40:32.378
I'm like really full right now,
so.

40:32.411 --> 40:33.980
Yeah.

40:34.012 --> 40:35.748
Next time.

40:35.782 --> 40:36.483
Yeah.

40:36.516 --> 40:38.251
Actually, I'll take that, yeah.

40:41.487 --> 40:42.955
You said you're full?

40:42.989 --> 40:43.990
Okay, yeah.

40:45.525 --> 40:46.193
Oh no!

40:46.226 --> 40:48.095
You never go to waste.

40:48.128 --> 40:49.329
Oh my god, please don't do
that.

40:49.362 --> 40:50.963
No, it's okay.

40:50.996 --> 40:51.998
Oh my god!

40:54.199 --> 40:55.335
Oh, so good.

41:01.474 --> 41:03.443
Goddamn, Cliff, who
taught you how to drive?

41:03.476 --> 41:04.309
Fuck off.

41:04.344 --> 41:05.177
Could you step on it,
please?

41:05.210 --> 41:07.447
Man, you trying to bring
attention?

41:08.414 --> 41:09.983
A little never hurt nobody.

41:10.016 --> 41:11.018
Until it does.

41:16.255 --> 41:17.891
Remember.

41:17.923 --> 41:18.759
- If shit goes south.
- Yeah, I know.

41:18.791 --> 41:19.793
I know.

41:20.793 --> 41:22.061
You don't have to tell me twice.

41:30.003 --> 41:31.004
Really?

41:32.070 --> 41:33.273
See, what'd I tell you?

41:34.840 --> 41:36.275
Fine, you're getting
lucky.

41:36.309 --> 41:37.544
I'm gonna get you next time.

41:37.577 --> 41:38.945
I always win though.

41:38.978 --> 41:39.980
We'll see.

41:40.579 --> 41:41.480
Yeah, come on.

41:41.514 --> 41:42.848
Hey, can I ask you
something?

41:42.882 --> 41:43.983
Yeah, of course.

41:44.016 --> 41:45.518
What's with the dog tags?

41:46.885 --> 41:48.054
They belong to my Pops.

41:48.086 --> 41:49.523
What, so you up and took them?

41:49.556 --> 41:50.758
Nah, he uh...

41:52.257 --> 41:54.293
See my mother passed
when I was really young.

41:54.327 --> 41:55.796
Oh, I'm sorry.

41:55.829 --> 41:57.164
Nah, it's okay.

41:57.197 --> 42:00.000
He said "Take these, they're
yours."

42:01.201 --> 42:02.802
They gave him courage.

42:04.237 --> 42:05.872
He thought they'd do the same
for me, so.

42:05.905 --> 42:06.907
And did they?

42:08.842 --> 42:09.976
Yeah.

42:10.009 --> 42:11.277
I think they do.

43:15.041 --> 43:17.044
I'll take the front, you take
the back.

44:38.458 --> 44:39.459
Come on.

45:04.384 --> 45:05.385
Attack!

45:05.418 --> 45:07.354
No, no, so many people!

45:08.487 --> 45:09.521
Pew pew pew pew!

45:09.554 --> 45:10.957
I'ma get you!

45:26.172 --> 45:27.173
Cliff!

45:27.773 --> 45:28.976
Did you kill him?

45:35.081 --> 45:36.083
Cliff!

45:55.333 --> 45:56.168
Fuck you, boy.

45:56.202 --> 45:58.571
You can't kill me!

46:01.706 --> 46:02.708
Cliff!

46:04.210 --> 46:05.211
Cliff!

46:06.646 --> 46:07.647
Goddamit!

46:07.679 --> 46:08.714
Is this what you want?!

46:08.748 --> 46:09.581
Fuck this!

46:09.614 --> 46:11.717
Ain't no stopping me!

46:14.619 --> 46:15.654
You couldn't take me then

46:15.688 --> 46:17.224
and you're not taking me now!

46:20.626 --> 46:22.796
So what do you got
going on this weekend?

46:22.829 --> 46:24.464
You down to hang?

46:24.496 --> 46:26.232
Yeah, ah, I can't.

46:27.300 --> 46:28.835
I'll be out of town this
weekend.

46:28.867 --> 46:30.469
I have an appointment with the
recruiter.

46:30.503 --> 46:31.336
Okay.

46:31.369 --> 46:32.405
Do you need a lift or?

46:34.106 --> 46:36.675
Thanks, but I already
bought a bus ticket.

46:36.708 --> 46:37.609
But when I get back,

46:37.643 --> 46:39.144
Wait, shit, what?

46:39.177 --> 46:40.212
- What is going on?
- Pull up, pull up,

46:40.246 --> 46:41.280
- please hurry.
- Wait, no.

46:41.313 --> 46:41.980
- I think we should probably-
- Janice, pull over!

46:42.014 --> 46:44.617
- Okay, okay.
- Pull over!

46:48.554 --> 46:49.456
Dad!

46:49.489 --> 46:50.490
Hey, hey, hey!

46:50.523 --> 46:51.557
- Let us do our job!
- Why are you arresting him?

46:51.590 --> 46:53.460
- Back away from the scene.
- It's okay, Robbie.

46:53.492 --> 46:54.494
You don't wanna be coming with
us.

46:54.527 --> 46:56.096
All I did was defend myself.

46:56.128 --> 46:57.563
Hey, let him go!

46:57.597 --> 46:59.265
Come on.

46:59.297 --> 47:01.167
Dad, I don't understand!

47:32.264 --> 47:33.266
Fuck.

48:25.851 --> 48:27.253
Gene, you up?

48:28.987 --> 48:30.322
If I say no?

48:31.224 --> 48:32.859
Never mind.

48:32.891 --> 48:36.562
No, though, I'm up.

48:36.596 --> 48:41.601
I'm up.

48:53.545 --> 48:56.248
Last night, I watched as they
rolled

48:56.282 --> 48:57.550
a body bag past me.

48:59.385 --> 49:00.587
And all I could think was

49:01.786 --> 49:02.755
let it be him.

49:04.690 --> 49:07.427
I mean there's still a
chance it could be him, it's-

49:07.460 --> 49:08.795
- Did you know we used to be
friends?

49:08.827 --> 49:10.862
Yeah, did you know we're still
friends?

49:10.896 --> 49:12.432
Me and Kenny.

49:12.465 --> 49:13.466
What?

49:14.333 --> 49:15.934
Are you serious?

49:15.967 --> 49:17.736
Well, when was that?

49:17.769 --> 49:19.371
This was years ago.

49:19.405 --> 49:20.406
How is that even possible?

49:20.438 --> 49:21.873
That guy is a jerk.

49:21.907 --> 49:23.410
He wasn't always that way.

49:25.277 --> 49:27.480
This one time when he came over.

49:27.512 --> 49:29.748
He brought me this empty pickle
jar.

49:30.882 --> 49:33.385
Said he couldn't keep it at
home.

49:33.418 --> 49:34.853
We're about 10 at the time.

49:36.355 --> 49:37.791
At first I didn't understand.

49:39.324 --> 49:41.227
But then he reaches into his
pocket,

49:42.295 --> 49:44.630
pulls out a fistful of beer
caps.

49:44.664 --> 49:46.833
He just pours them into the jar.

49:46.865 --> 49:48.300
Nearly fills it halfway.

49:49.501 --> 49:52.639
Then he looks at me with this
face

49:52.672 --> 49:54.240
as if he can hurt someone.

49:55.307 --> 49:58.610
And he says to me, "I earned
these."

49:58.643 --> 50:01.714
"Each one got my ass beat
and it was worth it."

50:04.750 --> 50:06.585
"I'm gonna fill the rest of that
jar."

50:07.320 --> 50:11.758
"And when I do, he's
gonna pay with his life."

50:11.791 --> 50:13.559
"I promise you."

50:13.592 --> 50:15.695
Who's he talking about?

50:15.728 --> 50:16.730
His dad.

50:19.798 --> 50:20.800
So did he?

50:21.333 --> 50:24.003
You know, the jar, did
you ever fill it up?

50:24.036 --> 50:25.070
No.

50:25.103 --> 50:26.372
But he came close.

50:27.940 --> 50:31.677
But then, my mother died.

50:33.713 --> 50:34.748
And we moved.

50:35.880 --> 50:37.850
And he just stopped coming
around.

50:40.920 --> 50:41.921
Yeah.

50:51.864 --> 50:53.365
I'm gonna keep the light on.

50:56.034 --> 50:57.036
Nice talk.

50:58.603 --> 51:01.407
It's just 'cause my
eyes are dilated and...

51:12.952 --> 51:14.620
Boys, who's ready for more?

51:14.652 --> 51:16.521
Hit me with another stack, Ma.

51:16.554 --> 51:17.690
No thanks, Miss Fletcher.

51:17.722 --> 51:19.425
We have breaking news right
now.

51:19.458 --> 51:21.827
Late last night, a home
invasion rocked our community

51:21.860 --> 51:23.663
when two masked assailants

51:23.695 --> 51:25.898
attacked a local man, Arthur
Stinson.

51:25.931 --> 51:27.833
Holy shit, you seeing this?

51:27.867 --> 51:28.535
Gene, quiet down, I can't
hear!

51:28.568 --> 51:30.470
Killed one of the attackers

51:30.503 --> 51:34.073
who's been identified as
21 year old Cliff Groader.

51:34.106 --> 51:36.042
- No fricking way.
- Another unidentified suspect

51:36.074 --> 51:37.576
is still at large.

51:37.610 --> 51:38.978
So remain vigilant.

51:39.010 --> 51:41.380
Keep your doors locked at all
times.

51:41.414 --> 51:42.415
Oh.

51:43.481 --> 51:44.983
Man, this is bad.

51:45.016 --> 51:47.452
Robbie, you know who's
still at large, right?

51:47.485 --> 51:48.954
I mean come on, it has to be-

51:48.987 --> 51:50.021
- Gene!

51:50.054 --> 51:51.923
Kenny wouldn't do that.

51:51.956 --> 51:54.726
Sometimes he takes
things a little too far.

51:54.760 --> 51:56.496
But he wouldn't do that.

51:56.528 --> 51:58.764
You don't know that.

51:58.797 --> 51:59.932
He wouldn't.

52:02.601 --> 52:04.570
Robbie, it's
for you.

52:14.646 --> 52:15.782
Hello?

52:15.815 --> 52:16.782
Robbie?

52:16.815 --> 52:17.916
How you holding up?

52:17.949 --> 52:18.817
Dad?

52:18.851 --> 52:20.019
How'd you find me here?

52:20.052 --> 52:22.588
Because I knew this was
the only place you had to go.

52:22.621 --> 52:23.722
I saw the news.

52:23.755 --> 52:26.125
Yeah, well then you know
I did what had to be done.

52:26.157 --> 52:27.159
Listen Dad.

52:28.860 --> 52:30.061
There's something I gotta tell
you.

52:30.094 --> 52:32.130
Okay, but make it quick.

52:32.164 --> 52:34.600
I know the guys that did it.

52:34.632 --> 52:36.735
I knew the guys that attacked
you.

52:36.768 --> 52:38.971
And it wasn't meant for
you, that was meant for me.

52:39.003 --> 52:40.005
And if that wasn't bad enough,

52:40.039 --> 52:41.607
one of them is still out there.

52:41.639 --> 52:43.141
And he's gonna come
back and finish the job

52:43.175 --> 52:44.577
and I don't, I don't know what
to do.

52:44.610 --> 52:45.612
No, listen.

52:46.346 --> 52:48.981
As soon as I straighten
this out, I'm coming home.

52:49.014 --> 52:50.016
You hear me?

52:50.615 --> 52:53.452
In the meantime, I want
you to get on that bus

52:53.485 --> 52:55.188
and stay out of town for a few
days.

52:55.221 --> 52:56.856
Dad, the recruitment can wait!

52:56.889 --> 52:58.925
Robbie, my time is up!

52:58.958 --> 53:01.193
Get on that damn bus!

53:17.543 --> 53:18.545
Yeah, what is it?

53:20.512 --> 53:21.748
Shit, hold on.

53:22.748 --> 53:24.016
Kenny!

53:24.048 --> 53:26.786
You gotta tell this girl
to stop calling, goddamit!

53:31.023 --> 53:32.925
Yeah he don't live here anymore.

54:04.822 --> 54:06.759
- Get your ass up!
- Agh, shit!

54:06.791 --> 54:07.626
What the fuck?!

54:07.659 --> 54:09.194
Shut your fucking mouth!

54:09.228 --> 54:11.831
You got your friend killed,
didn't you?

54:11.864 --> 54:12.898
I didn't do shit!

54:12.931 --> 54:14.866
Tell that to his parents.

54:14.900 --> 54:16.702
I know you were there, I know
you.

54:16.735 --> 54:18.238
You don't fucking know me.

54:20.806 --> 54:22.108
I'll give you a head start

54:23.208 --> 54:25.010
but then I'm turning you in.

54:25.043 --> 54:26.045
Fuck you.

54:46.065 --> 54:47.700
Look what you made me do!

54:47.733 --> 54:48.935
You did this.

54:48.967 --> 54:50.068
This is your fault!

54:50.101 --> 54:52.904
You think I did this, me?

54:52.938 --> 54:54.673
Unless you drag your coked up
whore

54:54.706 --> 54:56.174
- of a mother into this shit,
- No.

54:56.208 --> 54:57.209
you best leave my name

54:57.242 --> 54:58.811
out of your goddamn excuses.

54:58.844 --> 55:00.980
No, she was what she
was but she loved me.

55:02.014 --> 55:03.282
You just love to hurt me!

55:06.117 --> 55:07.119
Well.

55:07.786 --> 55:10.622
What are you waiting for, huh?

55:46.992 --> 55:49.095
I'll see
you in a few days, man.

55:49.128 --> 55:50.730
Are you sure you don't want me
to come?

55:50.762 --> 55:52.197
I could trick my mom into
thinking-

55:52.231 --> 55:55.234
- No, no, just be safe, all
right?

55:55.266 --> 55:56.268
All right.

55:57.402 --> 55:58.737
- Get outta here.
- What?

55:58.771 --> 55:59.772
Come here, man.

56:00.706 --> 56:01.774
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

56:02.708 --> 56:03.643
You're so awkward.

56:03.675 --> 56:05.844
Well you know I hate it, so.

56:05.878 --> 56:06.546
Be safe.

56:06.579 --> 56:08.781
Yeah, you stay safe too, man.

57:20.284 --> 57:21.853
What are you doing here?

57:21.887 --> 57:23.155
Gene said I could find you
here.

57:23.188 --> 57:25.825
I figured you'd need a lift.

57:25.858 --> 57:26.492
You didn't have to come-

57:26.525 --> 57:27.992
- Robbie, I know.

57:28.025 --> 57:30.395
I'm here because I wanna be.

57:32.297 --> 57:33.298
Just get in.

57:38.836 --> 57:41.373
You know you don't have to
tell me about what happened.

57:41.405 --> 57:42.974
I don't need to know, I know
it's none of my business

57:43.007 --> 57:45.176
but it's kind of hard to ignore.

57:45.210 --> 57:46.144
It's on like every channel.

57:46.177 --> 57:47.413
Can I ask you something?

57:48.347 --> 57:49.515
Yeah, anything.

57:49.547 --> 57:50.982
Why are you doing this?

57:51.916 --> 57:52.918
Helping me out.

57:53.786 --> 57:54.787
I'm nobody to you.

57:55.387 --> 57:56.522
People just don't do shit for me

57:56.554 --> 57:57.856
like they would for you.

57:57.889 --> 57:59.057
Don't say that, that's not-

57:59.090 --> 57:59.759
- You won't understand.

57:59.791 --> 58:00.625
Yeah I wouldn't understand,

58:00.659 --> 58:02.894
I'm just supposed to accept that
answer?

58:03.795 --> 58:04.896
No.

58:04.931 --> 58:07.500
No, you know what, you're
right, I don't understand.

58:07.532 --> 58:09.434
Robbie, you won't fucking let
me.

58:10.568 --> 58:12.204
I don't think it's safe for me

58:12.237 --> 58:13.740
to be around you right now.

58:43.601 --> 58:45.270
You know how this works.

58:45.304 --> 58:46.472
I've read your file.

58:46.505 --> 58:47.306
I hope so.

58:47.338 --> 58:49.208
That's your damn job.

58:50.275 --> 58:51.110
The boy you shot.

58:51.143 --> 58:52.411
The man I shot.

58:53.445 --> 58:54.847
Doesn't matter now.

58:54.880 --> 58:55.882
Dead is dead.

58:56.981 --> 58:58.951
Point being, his name is Cliff
Groader.

58:59.885 --> 59:01.087
Name mean anything to you?

59:02.521 --> 59:03.989
His father runs a shit motel

59:04.021 --> 59:05.090
down the edge of town.

59:06.625 --> 59:08.860
Crazy son of a bitch.

59:08.893 --> 59:10.328
Must be something in the blood.

59:11.597 --> 59:13.032
What's that got to do with me?

59:14.900 --> 59:15.902
See your file?

59:17.034 --> 59:19.038
Isn't half as big as his.

59:19.070 --> 59:20.239
So, what now?

59:20.271 --> 59:21.539
Am I free to go?

59:21.572 --> 59:22.574
Getting there.

59:23.175 --> 59:27.413
Except, uh, our fugitive
is still on the run.

59:27.445 --> 59:30.048
You wouldn't happen to know
who that might have been?

59:30.949 --> 59:31.951
No.

1:00:40.184 --> 1:00:41.320
Have a good day.

1:00:42.688 --> 1:00:44.423
Hello, do you have an
appointment?

1:00:44.456 --> 1:00:46.659
Yes, ma'am, for Robbie
Stinson.

1:00:46.692 --> 1:00:50.329
Robbie Stinson, okay.

1:00:50.362 --> 1:00:52.130
All right, follow me this way
please.

1:00:53.565 --> 1:00:54.500
So you're here to join

1:00:54.532 --> 1:00:56.235
or you're just here to
see how much we pay?

1:00:56.268 --> 1:00:58.202
No sir, I'm here to join.

1:00:58.235 --> 1:00:59.270
Now tell me why.

1:00:59.304 --> 1:01:01.606
Because I wanna be the best,
sir.

1:01:01.639 --> 1:01:03.541
And I'm tired of living in fear.

1:01:03.574 --> 1:01:05.677
And if I have to work my
ass off to get that respect

1:01:05.710 --> 1:01:08.012
then that's what I'm willing to
fight for.

1:01:08.045 --> 1:01:09.614
Are you willing to die for
this?

1:02:07.806 --> 1:02:09.407
It's you.

1:02:09.440 --> 1:02:11.376
You actually came.

1:02:11.409 --> 1:02:14.012
Man, I almost didn't find this
place.

1:02:14.045 --> 1:02:15.748
Well, I'm glad you did.

1:02:15.780 --> 1:02:17.682
Don't go anywhere, I'll be right
down.

1:02:19.117 --> 1:02:21.553
Here at this facility we study
and track

1:02:21.585 --> 1:02:24.389
the electromagnetic energy
that surrounds the human body.

1:02:24.422 --> 1:02:27.759
And what do you do with all
that?

1:02:27.793 --> 1:02:30.662
Energy never stops existing.

1:02:30.695 --> 1:02:32.431
Even when we do.

1:02:32.463 --> 1:02:36.067
When we die, our energy is
repurposed

1:02:36.101 --> 1:02:38.436
back into the universe.

1:02:38.469 --> 1:02:40.038
And by that accord, we theorize

1:02:40.072 --> 1:02:43.342
that new life is where it
continues its trajectory.

1:02:45.177 --> 1:02:46.612
You mean like reincarnation?

1:02:49.481 --> 1:02:51.117
Why did you really come here?

1:02:52.751 --> 1:02:54.586
'Cause of what you said

1:02:54.619 --> 1:02:56.489
about our lives not ending.

1:02:59.190 --> 1:03:00.192
I guess...

1:03:01.492 --> 1:03:03.828
I guess I wasn't feeling safe.

1:03:03.862 --> 1:03:05.764
Just need a little hope.

1:03:05.797 --> 1:03:09.802
Have you ever dreamt of
someone you've never met,

1:03:09.835 --> 1:03:13.072
memories that didn't seem your
own?

1:03:14.505 --> 1:03:16.674
I mean, yeah, I guess.

1:03:16.708 --> 1:03:20.778
We speculate that these are
fragments

1:03:20.811 --> 1:03:22.815
of who came before you.

1:03:23.481 --> 1:03:26.451
But to prove that, we need time

1:03:27.485 --> 1:03:28.686
and a network.

1:03:28.721 --> 1:03:33.092
One sophisticated enough to
database every living person.

1:03:34.326 --> 1:03:37.695
And that just grazes the
surface.

1:03:38.864 --> 1:03:39.731
The whole thing was constructed

1:03:39.764 --> 1:03:41.700
during the second world war.

1:03:41.733 --> 1:03:42.735
Whoah.

1:03:43.869 --> 1:03:45.269
What are they doing to her?

1:03:45.302 --> 1:03:47.105
Collecting
data, of course.

1:03:47.139 --> 1:03:48.507
Did she volunteer?

1:03:49.907 --> 1:03:51.309
More or less.

1:03:53.344 --> 1:03:56.514
Come, there is one final
room I want to show you.

1:04:01.853 --> 1:04:04.556
This room is for confessionals

1:04:04.588 --> 1:04:07.291
where one decides what to leave
behind

1:04:07.324 --> 1:04:08.460
for the next.

1:04:09.360 --> 1:04:11.596
Like a time capsule?

1:04:11.630 --> 1:04:12.631
In a way, yes.

1:04:13.231 --> 1:04:17.302
I find the more useful
information you leave behind,

1:04:17.335 --> 1:04:20.172
the better results this
experiment shall wield.

1:04:21.373 --> 1:04:24.909
Telling someone your
sicknesses or bad habits

1:04:24.943 --> 1:04:29.381
or allergies could prove
to be a valuable precursor.

1:04:30.347 --> 1:04:33.418
So, say I make a video

1:04:34.518 --> 1:04:36.221
and you ran your test,

1:04:37.021 --> 1:04:39.657
how do you know where to
find who it's meant for?

1:04:39.690 --> 1:04:40.725
Excellent question.

1:04:42.460 --> 1:04:46.664
Unfortunately, we're not quite
there yet.

1:04:47.865 --> 1:04:48.867
The thing is...

1:04:51.735 --> 1:04:53.739
my life is real complicated
right now.

1:04:55.974 --> 1:05:00.446
There are days where I just
don't know if it'll be my...

1:05:02.880 --> 1:05:04.916
Never mind, just forget it.

1:05:08.820 --> 1:05:11.257
Would you like to give it a
whirl?

1:05:14.992 --> 1:05:16.761
Perhaps, say hello.

1:05:24.001 --> 1:05:25.804
I'm going to step out of the
room.

1:05:29.407 --> 1:05:31.710
The rest is up to you.

1:05:47.726 --> 1:05:49.260
I don't know how this works.

1:05:52.630 --> 1:05:53.699
I know I'm supposed to

1:05:56.434 --> 1:06:00.372
tell y'all the good about my
life.

1:06:04.775 --> 1:06:05.777
But...

1:06:07.012 --> 1:06:08.914
But then I'd be lying.

1:06:11.583 --> 1:06:12.617
It wouldn't be real.

1:06:17.422 --> 1:06:20.025
Real is, the other night,

1:06:20.057 --> 1:06:25.230
these two guys they came looking
for me.

1:06:46.550 --> 1:06:47.885
Russ, we uh,

1:06:47.918 --> 1:06:50.288
Look, we didn't mean to
involve you like this.

1:06:50.322 --> 1:06:51.690
I apologize for that.

1:06:51.722 --> 1:06:54.992
No, no, motherfucker,
I was always involved!

1:06:55.025 --> 1:06:56.126
I can't breathe!

1:06:56.161 --> 1:06:58.929
The deal's 50, you got a
fucking problem with that?

1:06:58.963 --> 1:07:00.065
No.

1:08:17.475 --> 1:08:18.744
Janice?

1:08:18.777 --> 1:08:19.877
What are you doing...

1:08:19.911 --> 1:08:21.445
Oh, I was just in the
neighborhood.

1:08:21.479 --> 1:08:22.614
You look

1:08:22.646 --> 1:08:23.849
That's okay, I'll wait.

1:08:26.850 --> 1:08:27.853
Um...

1:08:28.987 --> 1:08:31.457
Sorry about how we left
things.

1:08:32.123 --> 1:08:34.059
I didn't want it to be that way.

1:08:34.958 --> 1:08:36.661
Okay, so what do you want?

1:08:36.694 --> 1:08:37.930
Beside breakfast?

1:08:40.965 --> 1:08:43.502
Um... there's a diner on
the way back, you know.

1:08:43.534 --> 1:08:46.137
Robbie, I'm going to
let you get away with that

1:08:46.171 --> 1:08:48.907
because you still have drool on
your face.

1:08:48.939 --> 1:08:51.942
- You haven't even woken up yet.
- Oh, okay.

1:08:51.975 --> 1:08:52.911
All right.

1:08:52.944 --> 1:08:54.780
Look, I gotta make a
phone call right quick,

1:08:54.813 --> 1:08:56.414
so let me do that.

1:09:42.025 --> 1:09:42.894
Hello?

1:09:42.926 --> 1:09:43.760
Dad?

1:09:43.795 --> 1:09:44.930
I wasn't sure you were gonna be
there.

1:09:44.962 --> 1:09:46.664
Huh, where are you?

1:09:46.698 --> 1:09:47.733
I'm at the bus station, I had
a friend-

1:09:47.765 --> 1:09:50.601
- Robbie, I told you to
stay away for a few days!

1:09:50.635 --> 1:09:51.436
It's not safe!

1:09:51.469 --> 1:09:53.070
But dad, I got so much to tell
you.

1:09:53.938 --> 1:09:55.474
I know.

1:09:55.506 --> 1:09:57.641
All right, I have to head into
town.

1:09:57.675 --> 1:09:59.010
I'll be back in about an hour.

1:09:59.042 --> 1:10:00.679
We can talk when I get back.

1:10:00.712 --> 1:10:01.780
I love you, man.

1:10:01.813 --> 1:10:02.847
All right, love you too.

1:10:25.168 --> 1:10:26.704
This the place?

1:10:30.542 --> 1:10:31.877
Yeah.

1:10:31.909 --> 1:10:32.944
It's been detailed?

1:10:36.213 --> 1:10:39.518
There's one security
officer and he's old as fuck.

1:10:39.551 --> 1:10:40.752
That good enough for you?

1:10:42.252 --> 1:10:43.255
That depends.

1:10:44.154 --> 1:10:44.956
On fucking what?

1:10:44.988 --> 1:10:45.522
On whether you decide to run
off

1:10:45.556 --> 1:10:47.826
with my fucking money.

1:10:47.859 --> 1:10:49.127
You think I'm fucking stupid?

1:10:49.159 --> 1:10:51.229
You ran from my fucking
nephew.

1:10:51.261 --> 1:10:52.264
He's dead anyway.

1:10:54.798 --> 1:10:56.100
Motherfucker!

1:10:56.134 --> 1:10:58.168
The only reason why you're still
alive

1:10:58.202 --> 1:11:00.739
is 'cause I need the fucking
money!

1:11:00.771 --> 1:11:02.274
Oh, fuck!

1:11:02.306 --> 1:11:03.675
Are we fucking clear?!

1:11:03.707 --> 1:11:04.710
Yeah!

1:11:07.311 --> 1:11:09.680
Try it again,
motherfucker, I'll kill you!

1:11:27.798 --> 1:11:30.902
So did you like forget to eat
while you were gone or what?

1:11:30.935 --> 1:11:32.004
Something like that.

1:11:33.871 --> 1:11:34.972
And did you miss me?

1:11:36.274 --> 1:11:38.843
You still haven't said
anything, I'm waiting.

1:11:38.876 --> 1:11:40.078
Of course I missed you.

1:11:41.078 --> 1:11:42.079
You better have.

1:11:44.082 --> 1:11:45.717
Did you get what you needed down
there?

1:11:48.051 --> 1:11:50.721
You gonna eat that?

1:11:50.755 --> 1:11:51.757
Uh, no, all yours.

1:11:55.126 --> 1:11:57.195
Yeah, it was interesting.

1:11:57.862 --> 1:11:59.664
Was it what you expected?

1:12:00.998 --> 1:12:01.865
No.

1:12:01.899 --> 1:12:03.168
It was so much better.

1:12:04.202 --> 1:12:06.338
Now all I have to do is
graduate.

1:12:06.371 --> 1:12:07.672
Then I'm off to boot camp.

1:12:09.172 --> 1:12:14.145
So, what happens when
you go all GI Joe on me?

1:12:16.913 --> 1:12:18.649
What are you gonna do?

1:12:18.682 --> 1:12:19.984
Music.

1:12:20.018 --> 1:12:22.087
I've been chasing the dream,
maybe LA?

1:12:23.287 --> 1:12:26.157
Oh, so that's a real thing?

1:12:26.189 --> 1:12:28.092
- Okay, I'm sorry. I just...
- Yeah.

1:12:28.126 --> 1:12:30.028
No, Robbie, it's okay.

1:12:30.060 --> 1:12:33.965
Listen, I just wanna know about
us.

1:12:33.997 --> 1:12:36.701
Like, school's ending in three
weeks, and,

1:12:36.734 --> 1:12:38.070
I get it, I get it.

1:12:39.171 --> 1:12:43.908
I mean, there's no reason we
both can't have the same thing.

1:12:43.940 --> 1:12:46.778
You do you, I'll do me.

1:12:46.810 --> 1:12:50.047
No matter what happens,
I'll find you, promise.

1:12:56.720 --> 1:12:58.189
Ready to do this?

1:13:05.029 --> 1:13:09.935
- Everybody get on the floor!
- Get the fuck on the ground!

1:13:14.404 --> 1:13:15.974
Whoah, what's going on?

1:13:16.006 --> 1:13:17.208
I don't know.

1:13:26.951 --> 1:13:28.219
Russ, Russ the keys!

1:13:28.252 --> 1:13:32.190
Throw me the keys,
goddamit, hurry up, come on!

1:13:34.891 --> 1:13:35.827
Freeze!

1:13:35.859 --> 1:13:36.927
Russ, Russ!

1:14:10.060 --> 1:14:11.028
Next time, I'm totally gonna
get

1:14:11.061 --> 1:14:12.229
the chocolate milkshake.

1:14:12.262 --> 1:14:13.765
You should have got it.

1:14:13.797 --> 1:14:14.998
The vanilla was better.

1:14:15.032 --> 1:14:16.900
Hey, that's my dad's truck.

1:14:16.934 --> 1:14:17.769
Janice, honk the horn.

1:14:17.801 --> 1:14:18.737
Honk the!

1:14:19.837 --> 1:14:20.939
Is that Robbie?

1:14:22.239 --> 1:14:23.440
Oh no, no, no, no!

1:14:27.912 --> 1:14:29.280
Dad!

1:14:29.313 --> 1:14:30.882
Janice, go get him!

1:14:30.914 --> 1:14:31.750
Wait, Robbie, Robbie!

1:14:31.783 --> 1:14:32.784
Shit!

1:14:43.994 --> 1:14:45.096
Mr. Stinson.

1:14:47.164 --> 1:14:48.500
- You mother-
- Dad!

1:14:48.533 --> 1:14:49.167
Dad, you all right?

1:14:49.201 --> 1:14:50.902
No, Robbie, you stay away!

1:14:50.935 --> 1:14:51.903
Let me handle this!

1:14:51.935 --> 1:14:52.770
Shut up!

1:14:52.804 --> 1:14:56.074
Robbie, wow.

1:14:56.106 --> 1:14:57.375
Look what we have here.

1:14:57.408 --> 1:14:59.043
Kenny, it's over.

1:14:59.076 --> 1:15:00.177
Lower your weapon, man.

1:15:00.211 --> 1:15:01.846
Just lower your weapon.

1:15:01.878 --> 1:15:04.282
You know, in a different life

1:15:04.314 --> 1:15:06.050
we could have stayed friends,
man.

1:15:07.217 --> 1:15:09.354
I wish things were different.

1:15:09.386 --> 1:15:11.288
It's just too bad we
didn't have more in common.

1:15:12.456 --> 1:15:13.458
No, no.

1:15:15.560 --> 1:15:16.762
There is one thing.

1:15:20.463 --> 1:15:22.399
We outlived our fathers.

1:15:23.501 --> 1:15:24.503
Dad, no!

1:15:26.304 --> 1:15:27.271
Dad, dad!

1:15:28.439 --> 1:15:29.274
No, no, no, no!

1:15:29.306 --> 1:15:30.108
Don't die on me, man!

1:15:30.140 --> 1:15:33.344
Please, I need you, don't die on
me!

1:15:35.613 --> 1:15:37.115
I love you, Robbie.

1:15:37.148 --> 1:15:38.248
No!

1:15:44.255 --> 1:15:45.590
Oh dad, I gotta finish this
today!

1:15:45.622 --> 1:15:46.824
Robbie, no!

1:15:58.536 --> 1:16:00.070
Robbie, back off, it's over!

1:16:00.104 --> 1:16:01.039
You fucked up this time,
Kenny!

1:16:02.305 --> 1:16:03.140
Goddamit, get off of me, shit!

1:16:03.173 --> 1:16:07.612
Ah, fuck! Give it to me!

1:16:07.645 --> 1:16:08.980
Whoa, whoa, wait, wait, wait
wait!

1:16:09.012 --> 1:16:10.148
Hold on, okay, just a wait a
minute.

1:16:10.180 --> 1:16:11.849
Look, look, look, we have
history, man.

1:16:11.882 --> 1:16:12.516
We were friends!

1:16:12.550 --> 1:16:13.952
I hated you!

1:16:13.984 --> 1:16:15.018
I fucking hated you!

1:16:15.051 --> 1:16:17.021
I treated you like family,
okay!

1:16:18.189 --> 1:16:19.257
I was there for you!

1:16:20.291 --> 1:16:21.092
I had no one else.

1:16:21.125 --> 1:16:23.094
I know man, and I'm sorry,
okay?

1:16:23.127 --> 1:16:24.329
You had everything I ever
wanted.

1:16:24.362 --> 1:16:25.997
I know, man.

1:16:26.029 --> 1:16:27.197
And that wasn't fair.

1:16:27.230 --> 1:16:30.601
No, no, no, what you doing
right now, that's not fair.

1:16:30.635 --> 1:16:33.003
Your dad loved you so much.

1:16:33.037 --> 1:16:34.405
So fucking much.

1:16:35.105 --> 1:16:36.875
And I'm never gonna know
what that feels like,

1:16:36.908 --> 1:16:38.243
you get it?

1:16:38.275 --> 1:16:39.109
I'm sorry.

1:16:39.143 --> 1:16:40.310
Kenny, no, please.

1:16:40.344 --> 1:16:42.547
I'm sorry.

1:16:42.579 --> 1:16:43.448
No.

1:16:43.480 --> 1:16:44.314
I'm sorry.

1:16:44.349 --> 1:16:46.284
You should have kept riding your
bike.

1:17:36.199 --> 1:17:40.037
They wanted me dead, but I
wasn't there.

1:17:41.204 --> 1:17:42.940
One of them got away.

1:17:42.974 --> 1:17:44.976
He's still out there.

1:17:45.009 --> 1:17:46.176
And I'm scared.

1:17:48.645 --> 1:17:52.082
I'm Robbie Stinson and this is
my story.

1:18:06.463 --> 1:18:08.300
Lola, dinner's in the
kit-

1:18:18.042 --> 1:18:19.410
- I need a word with you.

1:18:19.443 --> 1:18:21.445
It's eating you up, isn't it?

1:18:21.479 --> 1:18:22.747
What are you talking about?

1:18:22.779 --> 1:18:24.381
Just leave me alone,
okay?

1:18:24.414 --> 1:18:25.283
I'm not doing this right now.

1:18:25.315 --> 1:18:27.117
No, you are going to
talk to me

1:18:27.150 --> 1:18:28.452
and I am not leaving until you
do.

1:18:28.485 --> 1:18:31.088
Do you love him?

1:18:31.122 --> 1:18:32.390
What?

1:18:32.422 --> 1:18:34.192
It's a simple question.

1:18:34.225 --> 1:18:35.326
Your father, you're asking
if I love your father?

1:18:35.359 --> 1:18:38.329
No, the other man that you're
fucking.

1:18:46.569 --> 1:18:48.338
Oh my god.

1:18:48.372 --> 1:18:50.175
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

1:18:54.045 --> 1:18:55.046
Oh.

1:18:59.783 --> 1:19:00.985
You hit me.

1:19:03.554 --> 1:19:05.123
You hit your mother!

1:19:05.155 --> 1:19:06.190
I told you.

1:19:07.323 --> 1:19:09.059
I fucking told you.

1:19:09.092 --> 1:19:12.063
You think you know
everything, you know nothing!

1:19:12.095 --> 1:19:15.799
All you care about is
the meaningless violence.

1:19:15.832 --> 1:19:17.567
It's all you know.

1:19:17.600 --> 1:19:19.237
That's all you'll ever know.

1:19:20.371 --> 1:19:23.474
Open up your eyes, Lola!

1:19:23.506 --> 1:19:25.109
Those protests?

1:19:25.844 --> 1:19:29.014
They don't give one flying fuck
about you!

1:19:30.648 --> 1:19:32.750
Get the fuck out of my
room!

1:19:32.783 --> 1:19:33.785
Now!

1:19:49.533 --> 1:19:50.435
Lola, what are you,

1:19:50.467 --> 1:19:52.069
wait, wait!

1:19:53.337 --> 1:19:55.339
Professor Mcrae, Professor
Mcrae.

1:19:55.372 --> 1:19:57.075
Lola, please stop.

1:19:57.774 --> 1:20:00.545
You're not supposed to be
back here without clearance!

1:20:01.412 --> 1:20:02.079
Professor Mcrae!

1:20:02.113 --> 1:20:03.713
What is the meaning of this?

1:20:03.747 --> 1:20:05.716
Nothing makes sense anymore,
okay?

1:20:05.748 --> 1:20:07.652
I'm trying to understand, I
really am

1:20:07.685 --> 1:20:10.121
but everything around me
just keeps falling apart

1:20:10.154 --> 1:20:12.757
and it just feels like a
horrible, horrible dream.

1:20:14.457 --> 1:20:15.759
But that's not why I'm here.

1:20:16.726 --> 1:20:18.229
I'm here because of Robbie.

1:20:18.962 --> 1:20:20.764
Did you know that his convicted
killer

1:20:20.797 --> 1:20:22.699
got released early from prison?

1:20:22.733 --> 1:20:23.701
Yes, I do.

1:20:23.734 --> 1:20:26.170
Yeah, you should, it's
all over the internet.

1:20:26.203 --> 1:20:27.806
Good behavior my ass.

1:20:28.573 --> 1:20:31.576
You know that we both need each
other.

1:20:31.609 --> 1:20:33.111
Isn't that right?

1:20:33.144 --> 1:20:34.479
Yes.

1:20:34.511 --> 1:20:36.514
I need you to do something for
me.

1:20:38.481 --> 1:20:40.685
Help me find the people who knew
him.

1:20:42.153 --> 1:20:43.621
Even the one who killed him.

1:21:20.356 --> 1:21:21.692
People see the tie,

1:21:21.725 --> 1:21:23.327
they assume I come for money.

1:21:23.359 --> 1:21:25.262
They think I was born into
luxury.

1:21:25.296 --> 1:21:26.297
I'll tell you what.

1:21:27.230 --> 1:21:29.634
Ain't that the furthest
thing from the truth.

1:21:30.533 --> 1:21:35.772
Fact is, I've been working my
whole life.

1:21:35.972 --> 1:21:38.243
Been shoveling pig shit since I
was a boy.

1:21:40.711 --> 1:21:42.847
It's like my father used to say,

1:21:42.880 --> 1:21:45.716
when you stop moving, you stop
living.

1:21:45.748 --> 1:21:47.684
Keep up the good work, Kenny.

1:21:47.717 --> 1:21:49.554
Might be a tie in there for you
yet.

1:21:50.720 --> 1:21:52.189
You don't mind me asking you,

1:21:53.524 --> 1:21:56.294
what kind of wisdom did
your father leave you with?

1:21:56.327 --> 1:21:58.296
I don't know about your dad,
but,

1:21:58.328 --> 1:21:59.329
mine was an asshole.

1:22:01.497 --> 1:22:03.500
The sooner you accept that,

1:22:03.533 --> 1:22:07.471
life just gets so, so much
better.

1:22:08.972 --> 1:22:10.175
Good night, boss.

1:22:12.943 --> 1:22:14.412
What do you have for me?

1:22:14.444 --> 1:22:16.680
Lola, I strongly
suggest

1:22:16.713 --> 1:22:17.681
you reconsider this.

1:22:17.715 --> 1:22:18.650
This is not-

1:22:18.682 --> 1:22:21.385
- You know that's not gonna
happen, right?

1:22:21.417 --> 1:22:23.220
Well I had to
try.

1:22:24.887 --> 1:22:26.724
I don't have the clearance
to pinpoint them on the map

1:22:26.756 --> 1:22:28.458
but I have found their current
addresses.

1:22:28.492 --> 1:22:29.494
However...

1:22:30.426 --> 1:22:31.795
What is it?

1:22:31.828 --> 1:22:32.662
His father.

1:22:32.695 --> 1:22:33.597
Perhaps he...

1:22:33.631 --> 1:22:34.632
He's been through a lot.

1:22:35.899 --> 1:22:37.401
Perhaps he...

1:22:37.434 --> 1:22:38.769
Perhaps he's best left alone

1:22:38.801 --> 1:22:39.970
for everyone's sake.

1:23:58.849 --> 1:23:59.949
Gene, is that you?

1:24:02.485 --> 1:24:03.753
Please, I just wanna talk, okay?

1:24:03.787 --> 1:24:05.523
I mean no harm.

1:24:05.555 --> 1:24:07.625
How old are you, huh?

1:24:07.658 --> 1:24:08.626
You're just a kid.

1:24:08.658 --> 1:24:09.259
They're recruiting them
out of high school now?

1:24:09.292 --> 1:24:11.394
No, nobody recruited me.

1:24:11.427 --> 1:24:12.063
I just wanna talk.

1:24:12.095 --> 1:24:13.330
Who are you with, huh?

1:24:13.363 --> 1:24:14.431
This is how they get you.

1:24:14.465 --> 1:24:15.667
They show you a young girl,
you let your guard down

1:24:15.699 --> 1:24:18.735
and then boom, you wake up and
there's a chip in your neck.

1:24:18.769 --> 1:24:20.938
I wasn't born yesterday, sister.

1:24:20.970 --> 1:24:22.639
It really is you, isn't it?

1:24:23.873 --> 1:24:25.943
You're just how he described.

1:24:25.975 --> 1:24:27.711
This is so cool.

1:24:29.813 --> 1:24:31.015
Just how who described?

1:24:53.136 --> 1:24:55.773
Lola, I need to talk to you.

1:24:57.474 --> 1:24:58.476
Please, Lola.

1:24:59.576 --> 1:25:00.811
I don't want...

1:25:02.578 --> 1:25:05.682
I don't want trouble, I just
need to talk to you please.

1:25:10.186 --> 1:25:11.355
Lola.

1:25:49.158 --> 1:25:50.027
I don't believe it.

1:25:50.060 --> 1:25:52.897
I mean he,

1:25:52.930 --> 1:25:54.698
This is wild!

1:25:54.730 --> 1:25:56.599
Oh, just wild.

1:25:56.632 --> 1:25:58.735
So you don't think I'm crazy?

1:25:58.769 --> 1:25:59.771
Not a chance.

1:26:00.771 --> 1:26:03.606
Can I just say, I was
totally expecting glasses

1:26:03.640 --> 1:26:05.743
and to be honest, I'm
slightly disappointed.

1:26:05.775 --> 1:26:07.577
You and me both.

1:26:07.610 --> 1:26:08.546
They broke.

1:26:08.578 --> 1:26:10.113
That's why I don't have them on.

1:26:11.681 --> 1:26:12.682
That was that.

1:26:16.220 --> 1:26:18.088
I can see why he liked you so
much.

1:26:19.256 --> 1:26:20.625
I was his best friend.

1:26:22.024 --> 1:26:23.960
We were thick as thieves.

1:26:30.801 --> 1:26:33.537
Gene, is everything okay?

1:26:33.569 --> 1:26:34.572
You um...

1:26:35.572 --> 1:26:36.207
You need to go.

1:26:36.239 --> 1:26:37.173
Like right now, please.

1:26:37.207 --> 1:26:37.875
We're done here, please go.

1:26:37.908 --> 1:26:39.677
Gene, I... he was a good guy,

1:26:39.710 --> 1:26:42.579
He was my best friend, okay?

1:26:42.613 --> 1:26:43.614
Not yours!

1:26:50.554 --> 1:26:53.556
Dad, I'm really sorry,
like for everything.

1:26:53.590 --> 1:26:55.826
Lola, you don't need to
apologize.

1:26:55.859 --> 1:26:56.794
None of this is your fault.

1:26:56.827 --> 1:26:59.630
I know, but I've known
for a long time now

1:26:59.662 --> 1:27:00.497
and I didn't tell you.

1:27:00.530 --> 1:27:01.666
List... I...

1:27:04.734 --> 1:27:06.002
I'm gonna fix all this, okay?

1:27:06.036 --> 1:27:07.671
You don't have to do that.

1:27:07.703 --> 1:27:10.240
Lola, I know, I know.

1:27:12.042 --> 1:27:15.212
But I always knew what I
was getting myself into.

1:27:15.244 --> 1:27:16.814
That doesn't make it right.

1:27:21.018 --> 1:27:22.019
Dad?

1:27:25.322 --> 1:27:28.826
You could just ask
for the keys, you know?

1:27:28.859 --> 1:27:30.928
About that, um, I just-

1:27:30.961 --> 1:27:32.963
- No, no, no, it's fine.

1:27:35.765 --> 1:27:36.766
I love you.

1:27:37.568 --> 1:27:39.203
I love you too, Dad.

1:27:39.235 --> 1:27:40.238
Good night.

1:27:44.675 --> 1:27:45.676
Move!

1:27:58.255 --> 1:27:59.155
Welcome back, Ava.

1:27:59.189 --> 1:28:01.659
Why did you give this to her?!

1:28:02.393 --> 1:28:05.029
Um, I'm so sorry, I can't
disclose another client, so-

1:28:05.061 --> 1:28:05.962
- Excuse me?

1:28:05.997 --> 1:28:06.530
This is my daughter we're
talking about,

1:28:06.564 --> 1:28:08.899
not your fucking client.

1:28:08.931 --> 1:28:12.635
You better start talking
or I swear to god.

1:28:12.668 --> 1:28:14.671
Okay, okay, okay, just uh,
hold on.

1:28:17.006 --> 1:28:18.009
Professor.

1:28:18.942 --> 1:28:20.243
We have another situation.

1:28:21.243 --> 1:28:22.246
Hello?

1:28:23.313 --> 1:28:24.146
What?

1:28:24.180 --> 1:28:27.050
Okay, slow down, I can't
understand you.

1:28:27.083 --> 1:28:28.652
Stop yelling at me!

1:28:28.685 --> 1:28:30.054
What do they want with you?

1:28:30.087 --> 1:28:31.155
I don't know what you're
talking about.

1:28:31.188 --> 1:28:32.989
Don't you lie to me, Lola.

1:28:33.023 --> 1:28:34.958
I'm not lying to you, what's
wrong-

1:28:34.992 --> 1:28:36.126
- Where are you?

1:28:36.158 --> 1:28:37.894
None of your fucking business.

1:28:37.927 --> 1:28:38.761
Yeah, so what, okay,

1:28:38.796 --> 1:28:40.965
you're gonna start stealing cars
now too?

1:28:40.997 --> 1:28:42.732
I swear to god, Lola, if I find
out

1:28:42.765 --> 1:28:43.599
you're up to some stupid-

1:28:43.634 --> 1:28:45.802
What is going on
here?!

1:28:45.836 --> 1:28:47.838
This is not over.

1:28:47.871 --> 1:28:50.975
Mom, hello?

1:28:53.210 --> 1:28:54.177
You need to calm down.

1:28:54.211 --> 1:28:57.314
Professor, why did you
send for my daughter?

1:28:57.346 --> 1:28:58.615
If you'll just allow me to
explain.

1:28:58.649 --> 1:29:00.684
I did not consent to this.

1:29:00.716 --> 1:29:02.686
Unfortunately, that wasn't
necessary.

1:29:03.720 --> 1:29:04.922
Excuse me?

1:29:05.788 --> 1:29:08.257
Does she live underneath your
roof?

1:29:08.291 --> 1:29:09.860
No, of course not.

1:29:09.893 --> 1:29:12.796
Then shut your goddamn mouth.

1:29:12.828 --> 1:29:14.264
You don't know her like I do.

1:29:14.296 --> 1:29:17.033
You have no idea.

1:29:17.067 --> 1:29:21.939
Lola is young and impulsive and
reckless.

1:29:21.971 --> 1:29:24.240
So whatever ideas you've
implanted

1:29:24.274 --> 1:29:26.310
into that little brain of hers,

1:29:27.844 --> 1:29:30.614
I promise you, she's gonna
disappoint you.

1:29:31.782 --> 1:29:33.951
And when she does,

1:29:33.984 --> 1:29:35.820
it's gonna be too late!

1:29:38.788 --> 1:29:39.822
Excuse me.

1:29:39.855 --> 1:29:40.858
Can I get my bill?

1:29:45.462 --> 1:29:47.098
Missing something, wasn't it?

1:29:48.097 --> 1:29:48.998
What?

1:29:49.032 --> 1:29:50.266
Your breakfast.

1:29:50.300 --> 1:29:51.969
You didn't finish it.

1:29:52.002 --> 1:29:53.237
Is that a problem?

1:29:53.270 --> 1:29:54.972
You know what, I prefer spam
myself.

1:29:55.005 --> 1:29:56.940
Nothing like that salty piece of
pork.

1:29:57.608 --> 1:29:59.644
Liven up that first meal of the
day.

1:30:01.912 --> 1:30:02.913
Maybe it's just me.

1:30:04.113 --> 1:30:06.949
The thing is, every time you
open the can,

1:30:06.983 --> 1:30:08.318
it looks, tastes the same.

1:30:08.350 --> 1:30:10.319
It is what it is.

1:30:10.353 --> 1:30:12.256
How can something so simple

1:30:12.288 --> 1:30:13.423
never disappoint you?

1:30:14.323 --> 1:30:16.926
I'm sorry, why are
you still talking to me?

1:30:26.036 --> 1:30:28.172
Fetch you that waitress.

1:30:31.207 --> 1:30:32.308
She's not picking up.

1:30:34.911 --> 1:30:36.713
Do you even know what you've
done?

1:30:37.480 --> 1:30:39.115
If anything happens to her,

1:30:40.050 --> 1:30:41.185
this is on you.

1:30:43.386 --> 1:30:44.422
Give me his address.

1:31:27.363 --> 1:31:30.433
Who the hell are you?

1:31:30.466 --> 1:31:31.902
Um, I'm looking for Janice.

1:31:31.935 --> 1:31:34.004
Hey, come deal with this
shit.

1:31:40.476 --> 1:31:41.310
Can I help?

1:31:41.344 --> 1:31:42.346
Oh, fuck.

1:31:44.547 --> 1:31:46.216
It's so goddamn bright out here.

1:32:06.936 --> 1:32:08.538
I think I made a mistake.

1:32:08.572 --> 1:32:09.439
Hey where you?

1:32:09.471 --> 1:32:10.474
Hey!

1:32:13.210 --> 1:32:14.244
What's your deal?

1:32:21.150 --> 1:32:22.552
You remember Robbie Stinson?

1:32:26.021 --> 1:32:27.024
What?

1:32:30.226 --> 1:32:31.461
How do you know who that is?

1:32:31.493 --> 1:32:32.496
I just know.

1:32:33.029 --> 1:32:34.965
Even if I try to explain it to
you, you-

1:32:34.997 --> 1:32:36.032
- No, okay, then don't.

1:32:36.065 --> 1:32:38.068
Just get the fu... just
get the fuck out of here.

1:32:38.100 --> 1:32:39.235
I don't need this shit.

1:32:40.237 --> 1:32:41.238
Janice, wait.

1:32:46.376 --> 1:32:48.012
Do you still play?

1:32:52.114 --> 1:32:53.349
No.

1:32:53.382 --> 1:32:54.885
Don't really have it in me.

1:32:55.652 --> 1:32:57.020
Just kidding myself.

1:32:58.054 --> 1:32:59.056
I get it.

1:33:01.224 --> 1:33:02.993
What's your name?

1:33:03.025 --> 1:33:04.427
Lola.

1:33:04.461 --> 1:33:06.230
Lola, why are you here?

1:33:06.262 --> 1:33:09.899
Like why are you here,
here? Middle of nowhere.

1:33:09.932 --> 1:33:12.269
In my lawn asking me shit about
my past?

1:33:12.301 --> 1:33:13.302
What do you want?

1:33:13.336 --> 1:33:15.072
I need to know.

1:33:15.104 --> 1:33:16.940
I need to know why he killed,
Robbie.

1:33:19.009 --> 1:33:20.543
I asked myself that same
question.

1:33:21.511 --> 1:33:23.314
It doesn't matter, he's gone.

1:33:24.047 --> 1:33:26.983
Maybe that's not what
you should be asking.

1:33:27.016 --> 1:33:28.652
Maybe try something else.

1:33:28.685 --> 1:33:29.887
I don't know.

1:33:30.621 --> 1:33:32.288
Maybe you should be asking why
the hell

1:33:32.322 --> 1:33:33.958
Kenny is still alive.

1:34:01.952 --> 1:34:02.953
Groader here.

1:34:03.653 --> 1:34:05.222
Yeah, same old song and dance.

1:34:06.523 --> 1:34:07.891
This one's a young girl.

1:34:10.993 --> 1:34:11.996
Hmmm.

1:34:13.997 --> 1:34:16.567
Name's Lola Rose.

1:34:28.144 --> 1:34:30.614
Oh, it's been a while.

1:35:18.194 --> 1:35:19.196
You hungry?

1:35:19.962 --> 1:35:21.465
Fixed you a plate, it ain't
much, but,

1:35:21.497 --> 1:35:23.132
Shit.

1:35:23.166 --> 1:35:24.034
Shit, this can't be happening.

1:35:24.067 --> 1:35:26.002
Settle down, have a seat.

1:35:27.270 --> 1:35:29.339
Please, would you just take a
seat?

1:35:29.372 --> 1:35:30.507
I'm not gonna hurt you.

1:35:36.046 --> 1:35:37.181
Here's the thing, Lola.

1:35:38.480 --> 1:35:40.182
You trespassed onto my property.

1:35:40.216 --> 1:35:43.320
I have every right to put you
down.

1:35:43.353 --> 1:35:47.224
And yet, there you stand free as
a bird.

1:35:47.256 --> 1:35:50.460
But still you look at me like
I'm some kind of monster.

1:35:50.493 --> 1:35:52.997
Aren't you though, some
monster?

1:36:02.372 --> 1:36:04.041
I think it's time that you
leave.

1:36:04.073 --> 1:36:05.108
No.

1:36:05.141 --> 1:36:07.543
I didn't come all this
way to be shown the door.

1:36:08.444 --> 1:36:09.612
I know why you're here.

1:36:09.645 --> 1:36:11.547
Then you know why I'm not
leaving.

1:36:11.581 --> 1:36:14.184
You think you're the
first person to threaten me?

1:36:14.216 --> 1:36:16.019
Oh, I didn't threaten you yet.

1:36:17.319 --> 1:36:18.287
I know that look.

1:36:19.255 --> 1:36:20.690
I wore it my whole life.

1:36:22.292 --> 1:36:24.161
Careful how you wield that
burning flame,

1:36:24.194 --> 1:36:26.229
you might just set the world on
fire.

1:36:26.261 --> 1:36:27.264
Don't tempt me.

1:36:29.498 --> 1:36:32.769
You have no idea what it's
been like

1:36:32.801 --> 1:36:34.537
to be caught up in this,

1:36:34.570 --> 1:36:36.706
this fucking witch hunt!

1:36:36.738 --> 1:36:39.708
You ruined people's lives!

1:36:39.742 --> 1:36:42.279
Jesus fucking Christ!

1:36:42.311 --> 1:36:44.613
I get it, I get it!

1:36:44.646 --> 1:36:46.248
So I killed a kid I didn't
fucking like!

1:36:46.282 --> 1:36:48.251
Say his fucking name!

1:36:48.283 --> 1:36:51.387
I swear to god, if you
don't say his fucking name

1:36:51.421 --> 1:36:53.190
and show him some goddamn
respect,

1:36:53.222 --> 1:36:54.490
I'll fucking kill you!

1:37:01.530 --> 1:37:03.567
Last chance, Lola Rose.

1:37:03.600 --> 1:37:06.803
Once I shut this, you
might not like the man

1:37:06.836 --> 1:37:08.738
behind these closed doors.

1:37:08.770 --> 1:37:10.073
There he is.

1:37:10.873 --> 1:37:12.542
Just the man I wanted to see.

1:37:17.212 --> 1:37:19.215
I was always good at hide and
seek.

1:37:20.216 --> 1:37:21.518
For some it's just a game

1:37:21.551 --> 1:37:25.556
but for me it's about survival.

1:37:28.423 --> 1:37:29.560
Every second I bought

1:37:31.327 --> 1:37:35.198
spared me from having
to feel a leather belt

1:37:35.230 --> 1:37:36.766
tear into my flesh!

1:37:39.868 --> 1:37:41.838
I guess what I'm really trying
to say is

1:37:43.472 --> 1:37:45.141
you come on out.

1:37:45.175 --> 1:37:47.444
I'll spare you that
anticipation.

1:37:48.810 --> 1:37:52.715
If you ask me, that's so so much
worse.

1:39:35.885 --> 1:39:40.591
Agh!

1:40:07.884 --> 1:40:08.885
How did you?

1:40:10.586 --> 1:40:12.889
He's the only one that knew.

1:40:14.489 --> 1:40:15.759
You couldn't...

1:40:18.994 --> 1:40:20.497
I was wrong about you.

1:40:22.899 --> 1:40:24.368
You're not like the others.

1:40:25.667 --> 1:40:26.670
No, no.

1:40:29.738 --> 1:40:31.540
I should have known.

1:40:31.573 --> 1:40:32.576
But I see it now.

1:40:35.078 --> 1:40:36.780
I see everything.

1:40:42.118 --> 1:40:43.420
Hold that thought.

1:41:06.876 --> 1:41:08.744
I don't suppose you-

1:41:08.778 --> 1:41:11.081
- What brings you to my neck of
the woods?

1:41:11.113 --> 1:41:11.781
My daughter.

1:41:11.814 --> 1:41:13.349
Should head back to the car.

1:41:14.751 --> 1:41:16.619
It isn't safe out this time of
night.

1:41:44.079 --> 1:41:46.449
You don't remember me?

1:41:47.449 --> 1:41:49.418
What are you getting at?

1:41:49.452 --> 1:41:50.454
I'm so sorry.

1:41:51.820 --> 1:41:54.090
I don't know why I thought you
would.

1:41:54.122 --> 1:41:55.826
You never did return my calls.

1:41:59.162 --> 1:42:00.364
I used to do things.

1:42:03.466 --> 1:42:06.036
But that had to stop
after the night we met.

1:42:06.935 --> 1:42:07.938
I was...

1:42:10.006 --> 1:42:12.542
I was drunk off my ass.

1:42:12.574 --> 1:42:15.378
I could barely hold myself up!

1:42:16.112 --> 1:42:17.646
But you didn't seem to mind.

1:42:21.984 --> 1:42:24.121
I was careless that night.

1:42:24.921 --> 1:42:29.458
Or as my mother put it, a
disgusting little whore.

1:42:29.492 --> 1:42:30.761
But that didn't last.

1:42:31.560 --> 1:42:34.530
Nine months later, she was
waiting on me hand and foot.

1:42:42.939 --> 1:42:44.606
Who do you think you are?

1:42:44.640 --> 1:42:46.476
You just gonna skirt past it
then?

1:42:47.710 --> 1:42:48.978
You come into my house

1:42:49.011 --> 1:42:53.849
and then you just drag me
through your twisted fucking past

1:42:53.882 --> 1:42:57.153
which I had no goddamn part in.
None!

1:42:58.854 --> 1:43:02.825
Look at you, nothing but a
fucking whore.

1:43:02.859 --> 1:43:04.861
Get off my property.

1:43:04.894 --> 1:43:06.896
Probably serves you right.

1:43:06.929 --> 1:43:08.965
That's why you ended up where
you did.

1:43:08.997 --> 1:43:13.602
You stupid son of a-

1:43:14.369 --> 1:43:17.807
I can only be what he raised
me to be.

1:43:20.976 --> 1:43:22.010
Mom!

1:43:31.720 --> 1:43:33.655
Felt good, didn't
it?

1:43:35.091 --> 1:43:37.093
Sorry to disappoint you.

1:43:38.961 --> 1:43:40.931
You're not gonna kill me with
birdshot.

1:43:45.234 --> 1:43:47.137
Maybe your mother was right
after all.

1:43:50.006 --> 1:43:51.975
Like looking into a mirror.

1:43:56.078 --> 1:43:57.547
Only had two shots.

1:43:58.547 --> 1:44:01.050
Gotta get your hands dirty
if you wanna kill me.

1:44:02.784 --> 1:44:04.220
Then it's a
good thing I have this.

1:44:04.252 --> 1:44:08.625
You should
really check on your mother.

1:44:08.658 --> 1:44:10.193
She might be dead.

1:44:10.225 --> 1:44:11.059
No!

1:44:11.094 --> 1:44:13.762
Goddamn you, you lying son of a
bitch!

1:44:13.796 --> 1:44:14.864
It's over!

1:44:14.896 --> 1:44:16.231
All of it!

1:44:16.265 --> 1:44:19.936
That's not what they
promised me at Next Life.

1:44:19.969 --> 1:44:22.038
Apparently, inmates on death row

1:44:22.070 --> 1:44:24.908
are quite the valuable asset to
them.

1:44:26.341 --> 1:44:28.545
Our prison was ripe for the
taking.

1:44:28.578 --> 1:44:29.813
That's not possible.

1:44:30.613 --> 1:44:32.782
I was useless to them in
prison.

1:44:32.814 --> 1:44:35.918
It wasn't till I got out
that they took me serious.

1:44:36.985 --> 1:44:37.988
Fuck!

1:44:38.753 --> 1:44:40.155
Fuck!

1:44:40.189 --> 1:44:42.091
Go on, Lola.

1:44:42.123 --> 1:44:43.592
Kill me.

1:44:43.626 --> 1:44:45.161
And see what happens.

1:44:45.194 --> 1:44:47.030
I'm gonna enjoy coming back for
you.

1:44:48.331 --> 1:44:51.935
When you least expect it,
I'm gonna hunt you down.

1:44:51.967 --> 1:44:54.737
And we're gonna do this over

1:44:54.770 --> 1:44:56.940
and over, and over again.

1:44:57.606 --> 1:44:59.809
This is just the beginning.

1:44:59.841 --> 1:45:00.911
Come on Lola.

1:45:02.078 --> 1:45:04.314
Deliver me to my next life.

1:45:05.648 --> 1:45:06.815
As you wish.

1:45:39.448 --> 1:45:44.186
21 year old
Lola Rose in police custody

1:45:45.154 --> 1:45:47.090
on suspicion of homicide.

1:45:47.122 --> 1:45:48.957
The man killed has been
identified

1:45:48.990 --> 1:45:51.293
as 40 year old Kenny McCoy.

1:45:51.327 --> 1:45:54.731
He was an ex-con who had his
own history with the law,

1:45:54.764 --> 1:45:57.065
having taken the life
of an innocent teenager

1:45:57.099 --> 1:45:59.869
Robbie Stinson over 20 years
prior.

1:46:00.935 --> 1:46:02.371
When officers arrived on the
scene

1:46:02.404 --> 1:46:04.039
the suspect was found near the
body

1:46:04.073 --> 1:46:07.677
holding a knife that was
allegedly used on the victim.

1:46:07.710 --> 1:46:09.412
A motive is still under
investigation

1:46:09.444 --> 1:46:11.680
but the Chief of Police did not
rule out

1:46:11.713 --> 1:46:14.751
there being a connection
to McCoy's criminal past.

1:46:30.065 --> 1:46:31.867
Why were you out there with
him?

1:46:32.902 --> 1:46:35.070
It all seems a bit premeditated.

1:46:41.143 --> 1:46:42.145
You a lawyer?

1:46:42.978 --> 1:46:43.947
Indeed I am.

1:46:45.247 --> 1:46:46.249
Have a seat.

1:46:57.993 --> 1:46:59.395
We're already recording.

1:46:59.427 --> 1:47:01.230
This isn't for you.

1:47:02.965 --> 1:47:04.167
I know why I'm here.

1:47:05.234 --> 1:47:07.470
I know what I did was wrong

1:47:07.502 --> 1:47:09.706
and there's gonna be
consequences.

1:47:10.773 --> 1:47:12.742
And you wanna know why I did it.

1:47:13.908 --> 1:47:16.746
Some might not agree with my
actions

1:47:16.779 --> 1:47:19.816
and I may have just started
something I can't finish.

1:47:21.417 --> 1:47:23.319
But this is so much bigger than
me.

1:47:24.052 --> 1:47:26.288
It is so much bigger than all of
us.

1:47:27.523 --> 1:47:30.059
So, whoever is listening to
this,

1:47:30.091 --> 1:47:32.127
know that I warned you.

1:47:33.395 --> 1:47:34.864
They're coming for us.

1:47:36.097 --> 1:47:38.868
But if you stick with
me and just hear me out,

1:47:41.237 --> 1:47:43.239
I can't promise that you'll be
safe.

1:47:44.539 --> 1:47:45.742
But you'll know.

1:47:48.010 --> 1:47:49.112
You'll know the truth.

1:47:50.479 --> 1:47:52.882
And that one day might just save
you.

1:47:56.085 --> 1:47:58.121
What kind of confession is
this shit?

1:47:59.889 --> 1:48:01.791
My name is Lola Rose.

1:48:04.025 --> 1:48:05.228
And this is my story.
