00:12.276 --> 00:15.916
Alright. The options for this month's game night are:

00:16.096 --> 00:19.876
checkers, cards, Double Dutch, Tiddly Winks and--

00:20.846 --> 00:23.456
"My Mom" isn't a game, Muscle Man.

00:23.546 --> 00:24.776
That doesn't even make sense.

00:24.826 --> 00:26.996
Looks like I win!

00:27.556 --> 00:29.866
Let's play Ball-bo Catcher!

00:31.706 --> 00:33.306
A crossword puzzle?

00:33.396 --> 00:34.926
Okay, let's vote.

00:36.726 --> 00:38.156
Yes, Mordecai?

00:38.186 --> 00:39.356
Oh, nothing.

00:39.476 --> 00:41.246
Do you have a better idea?

00:41.266 --> 00:44.546
We could play one of those stale old games we usually play.

00:44.546 --> 00:48.706
Or we could play the sci-fi fantasy epic of the century!

00:48.706 --> 00:51.826
Behold, The Realm of Darthon!

00:53.986 --> 00:55.186
So, what is it?

00:55.186 --> 00:56.566
It's a role-playing game.

00:56.566 --> 00:58.936
We make up an adventure and you guys try to beat it.

00:58.936 --> 01:00.736
You can use magic and stuff!

01:00.736 --> 01:03.716
A game of imagination? What fun!

01:03.756 --> 01:04.976
Sounds lame.

01:04.976 --> 01:06.036
No way!

01:06.036 --> 01:08.806
The guy at the store told us it's the hottest RPG of the year!

01:09.776 --> 01:11.236
All in favor?

01:11.336 --> 01:13.716
- Yeah, yeah! - I guess.

01:14.656 --> 01:16.436
Darthon! Darthon!

01:17.726 --> 01:20.026
Get ready for the best game night of your life!

01:20.506 --> 01:24.376
Your party walks down a long hallway and reaches a locked door.

01:24.376 --> 01:25.696
What do you do?

01:25.866 --> 01:28.556
I smash it open with my war claw!

01:28.606 --> 01:31.996
Then, a bunch of ladies come out, and they're all,

01:32.016 --> 01:37.046
"Ooh Muscle Man, quit pinching my butt with your war claw!"

01:37.046 --> 01:39.636
Roll the 50-sided die to see if you unlock the door.

01:39.636 --> 01:43.356
All we have is a 48-sided die and two marbles.

01:43.426 --> 01:44.366
Close enough.

01:46.946 --> 01:48.006
Did it work?

01:49.766 --> 01:50.796
I don't think so.

01:50.796 --> 01:51.996
This blows.

01:51.996 --> 01:53.906
Mordecai! Mordecai!

01:53.906 --> 01:57.086
But I'll reckon I'd like a turn now!

01:57.136 --> 02:00.286
Cyborg cowboys take three days to awaken from hypersleep.

02:00.496 --> 02:01.806
Sorry, Pops.

02:02.706 --> 02:05.126
Can't he cast a saving throw?

02:06.056 --> 02:07.796
What does all this stuff mean?

02:07.796 --> 02:10.286
Are we even in Darthon yet?

02:11.096 --> 02:13.266
Or is that just an artifact for something?

02:14.016 --> 02:17.186
Your party is suddenly ambushed by a flock of manbats!

02:17.186 --> 02:19.036
Skips the Mighty gets first strike!

02:21.286 --> 02:21.936
Let's see...

02:22.016 --> 02:24.416
Pirate samurai have plus two times two shen...

02:24.416 --> 02:26.546
minus three charisma... divide by number of geese...

02:26.546 --> 02:27.686
Do we have a protractor?

02:27.686 --> 02:28.566
I'm outta here.

02:28.566 --> 02:30.916
Worst game night ever!

02:31.806 --> 02:34.136
Dude, they're right! This game sucks!

02:34.136 --> 02:35.646
Let's get our money back.

02:38.356 --> 02:40.616
Out of the way! Out of the way, everybody!

02:40.616 --> 02:42.526
Coming through, coming through!

02:42.526 --> 02:44.496
Out of the way! Out of the way people!

02:44.906 --> 02:47.066
We're here for a refund.

02:47.196 --> 02:50.926
I'd love to give you a refund, but, you need a receipt for that.

02:50.926 --> 02:52.396
I got a receipt right here.

02:52.396 --> 02:54.726
Excellent. And now the unopened product?

02:54.726 --> 02:56.966
What?! You can't return it if it's opened?!

02:57.056 --> 03:00.686
Well, yes! It's clearly stated on the back of your receipt.

03:00.686 --> 03:03.346
What?! That's lame! You can barely even see the writing!

03:03.346 --> 03:06.286
Yes, well, perhaps if you learned to read, it would be easy for you to see.

03:06.286 --> 03:07.586
Good day, gentlemen!

03:07.586 --> 03:10.346
Dude, just give us our money back. This game blows!

03:10.346 --> 03:12.926
Uh, The Realm of Darthon does not blow!

03:12.926 --> 03:14.636
You're probably doing it wrong.

03:14.636 --> 03:16.286
It's a role-playing game.

03:16.286 --> 03:18.506
You have to use your imagination.

03:18.506 --> 03:21.716
No way, dude! The game is the problem, not us!

03:21.716 --> 03:24.656
Uh, hey, are you guys gonna be wrapping this up soon?

03:24.656 --> 03:26.746
We're done here.

03:27.556 --> 03:31.956
Okay, I guess you won't mind if we tell people how "cool" your game is!

03:32.046 --> 03:36.046
Hey, everybody! Don't waste your time waiting in line for this huge piece.

03:36.046 --> 03:38.186
It's probably the worst game we've ever played.

03:38.186 --> 03:39.916
Yeah, and he won't even give us a refund.

03:39.916 --> 03:42.586
This guy doesn't give refunds, people!

03:44.966 --> 03:48.026
Let's go! I want you two out of my store, now!

03:50.786 --> 03:52.586
We can't let that guy get away with this.

03:52.586 --> 03:54.766
Dude, we spent the last of our cash on it!

03:54.766 --> 03:56.136
We have to get our money back.

03:58.036 --> 03:59.966
So, how do we do that?

04:00.126 --> 04:04.166
We'll just sabotage his business until he gives us our refund.

04:08.806 --> 04:12.566
Heh, nice outfits! Losers!

04:13.216 --> 04:14.766
You don't like these costumes?

04:14.766 --> 04:18.146
But they're from the "Make Your Own" section of the Darthon gamebook!

04:19.226 --> 04:22.516
That's right! We followed the instructions perfectly.

04:22.706 --> 04:26.336
But you used toilet paper rolls instead of paper towel rolls!

04:26.336 --> 04:28.676
The costumes look awesome when you do it right.

04:28.796 --> 04:32.686
Yeah? Do they look as awesome as the game pieces?

04:34.906 --> 04:38.476
Wait! There's lots of other characters if you don't like the pixie sorcerer!

04:38.476 --> 04:41.726
No there aren't! They're all just the same with different costumes.

04:43.996 --> 04:46.786
I didn't realize it was that kind of game!

04:46.786 --> 04:49.246
Nobody knows what kind of game it is.

04:49.246 --> 04:52.276
Is it medieval? Sci-fi? Western?

04:52.276 --> 04:54.396
It's a role-playing game!

04:54.396 --> 04:56.556
You have to use your imagination!

04:58.296 --> 05:00.676
That's right! Go get us our refund!

05:02.466 --> 05:03.286
No way!

05:05.926 --> 05:09.016
Dude. This campaign is just getting started.

05:58.846 --> 05:59.956
That's it!

06:00.806 --> 06:03.986
The Realm of Darthon does not suck!

06:03.986 --> 06:05.986
Yeah, but your costume does.

06:10.306 --> 06:12.916
No refunds!

06:22.936 --> 06:24.926
Dude, check out our costumes!

06:25.006 --> 06:27.156
Yeah, where are we?

06:27.466 --> 06:30.516
Welcome, to the Realm of Darthon!

06:30.516 --> 06:33.226
Leave while you still can!

06:33.456 --> 06:35.976
We're not leaving without a refund!

06:37.706 --> 06:39.636
Then come and get it!

06:43.956 --> 06:45.056
Did you hear that?

06:45.056 --> 06:47.236
I think it's coming from a-- ...head!

06:48.256 --> 06:49.736
What are these things?

06:49.736 --> 06:50.986
Ignore it, dude.

06:50.986 --> 06:53.106
They're just lame enemies from the game.

06:53.106 --> 06:56.436
Lame? What do you think of manbats' teamwork?

07:02.506 --> 07:05.136
Next time, send enemies that don't blow!

07:05.256 --> 07:08.166
Well, if you didn't like those enemies,

07:08.256 --> 07:10.586
then how about some Mutant jellyfish!

07:10.586 --> 07:12.506
Robo-bears!

07:12.506 --> 07:15.546
Angry tree people with pixie sorcerers?

07:20.876 --> 07:21.726
Watch out!

07:23.246 --> 07:25.106
Dude! there are too many of the...

07:25.106 --> 07:29.636
Come on! Everyone knows technomancers can summon allies!

07:29.636 --> 07:30.276
Rigby!

07:30.836 --> 07:32.456
Summon allies!

07:36.286 --> 07:39.746
What the?! I told you guys I didn't wanna play this game.

07:39.746 --> 07:40.756
We need your help!

07:40.756 --> 07:43.016
We need the refund from the game master!

07:43.016 --> 07:43.726
What?

07:48.016 --> 07:50.146
When this is over, you two are dead!

08:05.006 --> 08:08.106
I changed my mind! Technomancers can't summon allies!

08:08.756 --> 08:11.216
What?! He's just cheating so he can win!

08:11.216 --> 08:12.446
Quit cheating!

08:12.786 --> 08:15.926
I'm not cheating! I'm using my imagination!

08:15.926 --> 08:18.366
That's what makes this game fun!

08:18.366 --> 08:20.366
That's what makes this game blow!

08:20.366 --> 08:21.126
Enough!

08:21.576 --> 08:25.316
I won't allow you to insult my realm any longer!

08:30.376 --> 08:33.145
I am Darthon!

08:38.236 --> 08:40.655
Still think this game blows?

08:44.246 --> 08:47.486
Lightning bolts have no effect on giant monsters!

08:48.786 --> 08:51.636
Projectile weapons deal damage to the user!

08:54.106 --> 08:57.306
Oh no! You stepped in a permafrost puddle!

08:58.206 --> 09:00.246
Players are frozen in place!

09:01.966 --> 09:03.016
Stay back!

09:04.986 --> 09:06.246
Self-destruct?

09:09.276 --> 09:10.776
We are not frozen.

09:11.726 --> 09:13.386
Looks like it's our turn!

09:14.556 --> 09:17.216
Your party is washed away by a flood!

09:17.866 --> 09:20.296
Our +3 awesomeness repels water!

09:23.906 --> 09:25.956
Fireballs are made of kittens!

09:26.216 --> 09:28.016
Kittens are man-eating tigers!

09:28.266 --> 09:30.296
Man-eating tigers turn into stuffed animals!

09:32.516 --> 09:34.326
Players lose their weapons when running!

09:36.106 --> 09:39.566
Warriors carry the immunity sword, which is immune to all rule changes!

09:39.716 --> 09:41.776
W-what? No! That's not--

09:49.556 --> 09:51.916
Now give us our refund.

09:59.526 --> 10:01.636
Yeah, we did it!

10:02.226 --> 10:04.276
Dude, are you okay?

10:04.556 --> 10:07.146
Yeah. I'm fine. Here's your refund.

10:07.146 --> 10:09.066
No, it's cool. You should keep it.

10:09.066 --> 10:11.606
No, no. You beat me fair and square.

10:12.296 --> 10:13.396
Are you sure you're okay?

10:13.396 --> 10:15.706
Yeah. We can take you to the hospital.

10:15.706 --> 10:18.106
No. No. I'm fine.

10:18.276 --> 10:20.646
I just need an icepack.

10:21.246 --> 10:22.846
I... just... gotta...

10:22.846 --> 10:24.996
I gotta go up and lay down for a bit.

10:26.206 --> 10:28.336
Mordecai! Rigby!

10:28.526 --> 10:30.576
Pops! Where have you guys been?

10:30.576 --> 10:33.066
We were hiding in the armor closet, then suddenly,

10:33.066 --> 10:35.226
we were in the stock room at Shoe Farm.

10:35.226 --> 10:39.056
Good thing it was worth it! Seven bones, baby!

10:39.056 --> 10:43.396
Seven dollars?! We almost died for seven dollars?!

10:43.396 --> 10:45.046
The numbers aren't important!

10:45.046 --> 10:46.226
It was the principle!

10:46.226 --> 10:50.086
Yeah! If we're gonna spend that kind of money, it's gotta be on a cool game!

10:50.166 --> 10:54.266
Yeah! Something like Trail of Elderich or The Lair of Anthalon.

10:54.386 --> 10:56.016
Dude! Is that out?

10:56.016 --> 10:58.056
Yeah. It came out last week.
