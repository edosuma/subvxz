WEBVTT

00:01.802 --> 00:03.104
Perhaps after this election,

00:03.137 --> 00:05.773
we can find a way
to work side by side.

00:05.806 --> 00:07.275
LAVON:
Kiss the past good-bye.

00:07.308 --> 00:08.409
I was flirting with you
in the debate,

00:08.442 --> 00:10.411
and I thought I felt something
coming back the other way,

00:10.444 --> 00:12.080
and if I got that wrong,
then I'm sorry.

00:12.113 --> 00:14.082
I was flirting with you, too.

00:14.115 --> 00:15.549
People can conquer miles,

00:15.583 --> 00:18.219
or any sort of obstacle,
if it's meant to be.

00:18.252 --> 00:19.153
Are you seeing someone?

00:19.187 --> 00:21.622
There may be someone
I may have feelings for.

00:21.655 --> 00:24.258
You act like you don't even want
Ruby Jeffries out of our lives.

00:24.292 --> 00:26.527
Why do you care so much about
getting rid of Ruby Jeffries?

00:26.560 --> 00:28.062
Ruby doesn't get to swoop in
and take him.

00:28.096 --> 00:29.797
I saw him first.
No, you didn't.

00:29.830 --> 00:31.765
I'm sorry?
We were in love once,

00:31.799 --> 00:33.201
and Lord help me,
I still think I am.

00:33.234 --> 00:34.102
And by one vote,

00:34.135 --> 00:36.337
the election goes to
Mayor Levon Hayes!

00:36.370 --> 00:37.805
(cheering)

00:39.107 --> 00:40.741
Oh, my.

00:44.812 --> 00:46.714
(Wade laughing)

00:57.158 --> 00:58.592
Yeah.
Hey.

00:58.626 --> 01:01.362
That better not be my
last black and white cookie.

01:01.395 --> 01:02.630
Is that what they call these?

01:02.663 --> 01:04.165
I feel like they kind of
phoned it in

01:04.197 --> 01:06.134
on the naming process.

01:06.167 --> 01:08.169
My mom shipped those
to me from New York.

01:08.202 --> 01:09.803
They're my favorite things
in the whole world,

01:09.837 --> 01:11.272
and now they're gone.

01:11.305 --> 01:13.407
Thought that about
tube tops, too,

01:13.441 --> 01:14.675
but they came back.

01:14.708 --> 01:16.610
(clears throat)

01:16.644 --> 01:18.846
Hey, look, I'm sorry, all right?

01:18.879 --> 01:20.548
I got, uh...

01:20.581 --> 01:22.116
I got seven minutes
till I gotta be at work.

01:22.150 --> 01:25.686
I'll make it up to you.
Oh, gee, how could I resist
such a romantic proposal?

01:25.719 --> 01:27.421
That's what I love
about our arrangement--

01:27.455 --> 01:28.589
no romance.

01:28.622 --> 01:29.757
No, get away.

01:30.891 --> 01:33.594
I'm not saying
that I want romance,

01:33.627 --> 01:35.329
but I'm also not
a Ford, you know,

01:35.363 --> 01:38.466
I need something besides
your key to start my engine.

01:38.499 --> 01:40.834
So you are saying
you want romance.

01:40.868 --> 01:42.870
No.

01:42.903 --> 01:46.207
I don't know.
Never mind.

01:46.240 --> 01:48.676
How did evolution manage
to skip BlueBell entirely?

01:48.709 --> 01:50.311
Well, it happens.

01:50.344 --> 01:51.645
We also missed out
on Bieber Fever.

02:00.421 --> 02:01.922
Whoa, hold on.

02:01.955 --> 02:02.923
Don't slam the door.

02:02.956 --> 02:04.358
Ruby's still sleeping.

02:04.392 --> 02:07.628
Oh, I see.

02:07.661 --> 02:09.597
You've had
your first slumber party.

02:09.630 --> 02:11.899
Yeah, there wasn't much
slumbering going on.

02:11.932 --> 02:13.367
If you get my drift.

02:13.401 --> 02:14.902
Oh, yeah, I do.
Oh!

02:14.935 --> 02:18.739
I'm starting to decode the
nuances of the local dialect.

02:18.772 --> 02:20.274
RUBY (yawning):
Oh, hey.

02:20.308 --> 02:22.643
Morning, Zoe. Wow.

02:22.676 --> 02:25.746
Pancakes, bacon
and a rose?

02:25.779 --> 02:27.815
Now that's romantic.

02:27.848 --> 02:30.284
It's supposed to
be eaten in bed.

02:30.318 --> 02:33.354
I know... I was
too far away from you.

02:33.387 --> 02:34.755
You know,
I'm-I'm gonna go

02:34.788 --> 02:36.724
while you're
still wearing things.

02:36.757 --> 02:38.792
RUBY:
Oh, hey, Zoe.

02:38.826 --> 02:40.961
Levon and I put all that
election nonsense behind us.

02:40.994 --> 02:42.896
I'm hoping you
and I can, too.

02:42.930 --> 02:44.332
You want to grab
coffee later?

02:44.365 --> 02:46.667
Oh, you know,
I wish I could,

02:46.700 --> 02:49.570
but Brick refuses to hire any
of the receptionist candidates

02:49.603 --> 02:51.672
that I like,
so now I am forced

02:51.705 --> 02:54.208
to teach an intern
how to work the phones.

02:54.242 --> 02:56.277
But, you know, the kids
these days are so techno-savvy,

02:56.310 --> 02:58.279
she'll probably teach me
a thing or two, huh?

02:58.312 --> 02:59.880
(laughs)
See you.

02:59.913 --> 03:02.416
(door opens, closes)

03:02.450 --> 03:04.585
She still hates me.

03:04.618 --> 03:07.555
I shall comfort you.
Oh, really?

03:07.588 --> 03:08.956
Mm-hmm.
And how are you
gonna do that?

03:08.989 --> 03:10.424
Okay, first we got
to get upstairs.

03:10.458 --> 03:12.326
(laughs)

03:16.964 --> 03:19.300
LEMON:
There you are.

03:19.333 --> 03:20.734
Today is a historic day.

03:20.768 --> 03:24.972
Mm-hmm, the anniversary of the
start of the Nuremberg trials.

03:25.005 --> 03:26.840
I have a history app.

03:26.874 --> 03:31.312
And it is the day that I found
my singular purpose in life.

03:31.345 --> 03:33.714
Oh.
That which will
fulfill me creatively,

03:33.747 --> 03:35.649
reward me professionally and
distract me thoroughly

03:35.683 --> 03:37.551
from the budding
romance between Levon

03:37.585 --> 03:39.987
and she-who-shall-not-be-named.

03:40.020 --> 03:43.591
Well, don't make me wait
till they update my app.

03:43.624 --> 03:46.460
We are starting
a catering business.

03:46.494 --> 03:48.529
Yes!
W-We?

03:48.562 --> 03:49.797
We've been dreaming about
it since the third grade.

03:49.830 --> 03:52.833
Remember when our lemonade stand
sold out in less than two hours?

03:52.866 --> 03:54.335
Mm-hmm.

03:54.368 --> 03:55.303
Well, what do you say?

03:55.336 --> 03:58.406
Oh, golly, what do I say?

03:58.439 --> 04:01.875
I say I am truly flattered.

04:01.909 --> 04:03.043
But now's not a good time.

04:03.076 --> 04:05.045
People are spending less
in this economy.

04:05.078 --> 04:07.381
Yeah, but we don't want to work
for those kind of people, so...

04:07.415 --> 04:08.682
And the businesses
struggling the most?

04:08.716 --> 04:09.917
Caterers.

04:09.950 --> 04:12.986
I just saw it on 60 Minutes.
You don't even have to check.

04:13.020 --> 04:15.723
Oh.

04:15.756 --> 04:17.024
Well.

04:17.057 --> 04:20.361
I guess I could just find
something else to do.

04:20.394 --> 04:21.629
I like the sound
of that already.

04:21.661 --> 04:22.896
I mean, I did do
a tremendous job

04:22.930 --> 04:24.398
working on Lavon's campaign,

04:24.432 --> 04:26.367
maybe there's something
for me in politics.

04:26.400 --> 04:27.701
Oh, Lord, yes.

04:27.735 --> 04:29.737
Do that. Mm-hmm.

04:35.409 --> 04:37.645
And this is the hold button.

04:37.678 --> 04:39.079
Ooh, I've always wanted
to put someone on hold.

04:39.112 --> 04:40.748
Look, I've been practicing.

04:40.781 --> 04:42.683
Good afternoon.

04:42.716 --> 04:44.318
Dr. Breeland
and Dr. Hart's office.

04:44.352 --> 04:45.653
Please hold.

04:45.686 --> 04:47.555
Love it. Very classy.

04:47.588 --> 04:50.057
Although, just "Hart" then
"Breeland" is easier to say.

04:50.090 --> 04:51.325
(door closes)

04:51.359 --> 04:52.326
BRICK:
Hello, everyone.

04:52.360 --> 04:54.362
Hey there, pickle.

04:54.395 --> 04:56.830
You are looking just as
cute as a button today.

04:56.864 --> 04:58.466
Thanks, Brick.
It's a new outfit.

04:58.499 --> 05:00.934
Yeah.
Looks like Stella
got her groove back.

05:00.968 --> 05:02.336
Well, Emily does
make me happy.

05:02.370 --> 05:04.405
Please don't ruin
it by talking.

05:04.438 --> 05:05.539
We had a horse-drawn carriage

05:05.573 --> 05:07.941
take us around
Charlotte last night.

05:07.975 --> 05:09.677
We sipped champagne

05:09.710 --> 05:10.978
and looked at the stars.
(phone rings)

05:11.011 --> 05:12.346
It was amazing.

05:12.380 --> 05:13.547
ROSE:
...Dr Breeland's offices.

05:13.581 --> 05:15.616
You can spare us
the gory details.

05:15.649 --> 05:16.884
Mm-hmm, okay.
I'll let him know.

05:16.917 --> 05:19.987
Uh, Dr. Breeland,
that was Coach Scott

05:20.020 --> 05:20.954
down at the high school.

05:20.988 --> 05:22.523
The entire football team has

05:22.556 --> 05:23.791
a bad case of athlete's foot.

05:23.824 --> 05:25.092
You have to help them
'cause we can't lose

05:25.125 --> 05:25.993
our big game against

05:26.026 --> 05:27.995
Thurlow High this weekend.
Okay, you, uh,

05:28.028 --> 05:30.531
check my calendar and, uh, see
if I'm free this afternoon.

05:30.564 --> 05:31.399
Come on, Jim.

05:31.432 --> 05:33.567
Since when did you
get into football?

05:33.601 --> 05:35.869
I'm not.
I am into Max Burgess.

05:35.903 --> 05:38.639
He's the placekicker.
He's smart and sensitive

05:38.672 --> 05:39.940
and thoughtful
and the best part?

05:39.973 --> 05:41.575
His girlfriend just
moved to Montana.

05:41.609 --> 05:42.976
Okay, I hope this
doesn't sound harsh,

05:43.010 --> 05:44.445
but based on
your previous obsessions,

05:44.478 --> 05:45.979
does he even know
that you're alive?

05:46.013 --> 05:47.448
That's the thing-- he does.

05:47.481 --> 05:49.517
We've had lunch three times
this week already.

05:49.550 --> 05:52.453
Yesterday, I traded my Ho Ho
for his Ding Dong.

05:52.486 --> 05:53.954
Okay, I'm not up
with the teen slang,

05:53.987 --> 05:55.689
but I really hope
those are still snacks.

05:55.723 --> 05:56.690
BRICK:
How's it looking?

05:56.724 --> 05:58.526
Uh, you have
a 2:00 and 3:00,

05:58.559 --> 05:59.593
but you're free at 4:00.

05:59.627 --> 06:02.530
Oh, but no, Emily and I were
gonna Skype at 4:00,

06:02.563 --> 06:04.665
and, uh, I need to set up
that camera in my office.

06:04.698 --> 06:05.999
It's always facing the wrong way

06:06.033 --> 06:08.769
and I'm kind
of working on a poem.

06:08.802 --> 06:09.903
I'm free. I'll go.

06:09.937 --> 06:10.971
Oh, no, no.

06:11.004 --> 06:12.973
Remember last year when
you pranced in there wearing

06:13.006 --> 06:15.509
those shorty-shorts and I got
all those irate phone calls

06:15.543 --> 06:17.611
from some mothers--
no, no, no.

06:17.645 --> 06:19.046
First, I did not "prance."

06:19.079 --> 06:20.548
I am not a show pony.

06:20.581 --> 06:23.484
Second, my wardrobe
is stylish,

06:23.517 --> 06:25.152
yet professional.

06:25.185 --> 06:27.888
Right, Rose?
Tell him.

06:27.921 --> 06:28.989
No, you are not going.

06:29.022 --> 06:30.157
No, I forbid it.

06:30.190 --> 06:31.391
I'm sorry, you forbid it?

06:31.425 --> 06:33.794
Rose, you got that calendar
open-- what year does it say?

06:33.827 --> 06:35.796
Bunch of Neanderthals,
you know?

06:35.829 --> 06:36.830
Maybe I don't need romance,

06:36.864 --> 06:38.766
but a little respect,
even a little courtesy.

06:38.799 --> 06:39.967
Would that kill anybody?

06:40.000 --> 06:41.168
No.

06:41.201 --> 06:44.037
Excuse me.

06:44.071 --> 06:46.774
And I was in such a good mood.

06:46.807 --> 06:48.542
(phone rings)

06:48.576 --> 06:50.844
Just say my name first.

06:57.951 --> 06:59.787
LAVON:
Morning, Lemon.

06:59.820 --> 07:02.923
Well, if it isn't BlueBell's
newest power couple.

07:02.956 --> 07:05.125
Lavon, it's nice to see you.

07:05.158 --> 07:07.828
Ruby, you wear defeat very well.

07:07.861 --> 07:10.464
Thank you, Lemon, and as always,
idleness suits you.

07:10.498 --> 07:12.533
(laughs)
Bye now.

07:13.801 --> 07:16.136
Yes (laughs)

07:19.272 --> 07:23.210
Goodness, I'm just running
into everyone this morning.

07:23.243 --> 07:25.479
It's like a private tour
of my own life.

07:25.513 --> 07:27.214
You okay, Lemon?
You look a little pale.

07:27.247 --> 07:29.082
Then the efforts
to avoid the aging effects

07:29.116 --> 07:31.018
of sunlight are succeeding.

07:31.051 --> 07:33.721
Are you okay or is this box
a little cry for help?

07:33.754 --> 07:36.890
Funny, funny. No, tomorrow is
Judge Perkins's 60th birthday

07:36.924 --> 07:38.659
and I'm throwing him a party.

07:38.692 --> 07:40.961
Oh, goodness, the only party
anyone would want to go to

07:40.994 --> 07:43.263
for Judge Perkins is the
spreading of his ashes.

07:43.296 --> 07:45.966
Exactly, which is why every year
a local lawyer

07:45.999 --> 07:48.736
gets the privilege
of hosting his birthday bash.

07:48.769 --> 07:50.571
Last year, Linwood Davis
hosted a luau for him

07:50.604 --> 07:53.106
and a tiki torch lit
the judge's toupee on fire.

07:53.140 --> 07:55.275
This year, Linwood Davis
lost every single case.

07:55.308 --> 07:57.611
Oh.
I cannot afford
to screw this up.

07:57.645 --> 07:59.947
Well, I'm happy to help
if you want.

07:59.980 --> 08:01.749
I have a little time
on my hands.

08:01.782 --> 08:04.017
Oh, no, that's mighty kind of
you, but I just hired AnnaBeth.

08:04.051 --> 08:05.118
For what?

08:05.152 --> 08:06.219
She started a catering business.

08:06.253 --> 08:07.755
She didn't tell you?

08:07.788 --> 08:09.222
See you, Lemon.

08:13.293 --> 08:15.829
Well, I guess we can add
Lemon to the growing list

08:15.863 --> 08:18.265
of BlueBell residents
not happy we're a couple.

08:18.298 --> 08:21.535
(groans) The only opinions that
matter to me are yours and mine.

08:21.569 --> 08:22.870
(laughs)

08:22.903 --> 08:24.872
You know it's
been five minutes.
Uh-oh.

08:24.905 --> 08:26.006
And my lips miss you.

08:26.039 --> 08:28.776
(giggling)

08:28.809 --> 08:30.644
(screams)
Oh!

08:30.678 --> 08:31.879
Hey!

08:31.912 --> 08:33.881
Get off my lawn, predator.
What-what are you...

08:33.914 --> 08:36.149
What the heck has
gotten into you?
I want that
man off my property.

08:36.183 --> 08:37.818
Lavon is my guest!

08:37.851 --> 08:38.952
Uh, Ruby, no.

08:38.986 --> 08:41.321
I'll go home
and dry off.

08:41.354 --> 08:43.991
My new suede shoes, man.

08:44.024 --> 08:45.893
Lavon, I'm so sorry.

08:45.926 --> 08:47.060
I'll call you later.

08:47.094 --> 08:48.095
Not on my phone,
you won't.

08:48.128 --> 08:49.597
I have my own phone.

08:49.630 --> 08:50.798
What is wrong with you?

08:56.036 --> 08:58.672
ZOE:
I want each of you to

08:58.706 --> 09:01.909
use the can of fungal spray
twice a day,

09:01.942 --> 09:03.944
and keep your feet dry.

09:03.977 --> 09:06.113
It should clear up soon.

09:06.146 --> 09:08.949
Any questions?

09:08.982 --> 09:12.052
Yeah, I got this raging case
of jock itch.

09:12.085 --> 09:14.588
(snickering)
You mind
taking a look?

09:14.622 --> 09:17.057
Ha, how cute--
a baby caveman.

09:17.090 --> 09:19.192
Okay, nimrods,
back to practice.

09:19.226 --> 09:20.961
Unless you want
to lose this game.

09:20.994 --> 09:23.130
But I promise you
if you lose this game,

09:23.163 --> 09:25.666
you will never ever
have a happy life.

09:25.699 --> 09:28.001
Go, let's go.

09:30.370 --> 09:32.072
The itching shouldn't
affect their playing.

09:32.105 --> 09:33.941
They should be fine.

09:33.974 --> 09:36.744
Really? I was hoping
that might be what's wrong

09:36.777 --> 09:38.946
with our kicker Max.

09:38.979 --> 09:40.247
ZOE:
Max?

09:40.280 --> 09:42.983
Is that Max Burgess?

09:43.016 --> 09:45.853
Yup, been in a
funk all week.

09:45.886 --> 09:46.987
Didn't his girlfriend
just move away?

09:47.020 --> 09:48.188
We're not Facebook friends.

09:48.221 --> 09:49.322
I don't know.

09:49.356 --> 09:51.324
Can you talk to him?
Thurlow games always

09:51.358 --> 09:52.359
come down to the wire.

09:52.392 --> 09:55.128
We need a kicker to win.

09:59.266 --> 10:03.003
Hey, Max.

10:03.036 --> 10:04.271
I'm Zoe.

10:04.304 --> 10:06.974
We didn't have a chance to chat
while I was spraying your feet.

10:07.007 --> 10:08.075
You're Rose's friend.

10:08.108 --> 10:09.409
She talks about you a lot.

10:09.442 --> 10:10.410
Isn't Rose the best?

10:10.443 --> 10:13.113
They really broke the mold
when they made her.

10:13.146 --> 10:16.650
That's what I used
to say about Lynette.

10:16.684 --> 10:20.020
Till she moved away to Montana.

10:20.053 --> 10:21.955
Just so far away,
it might as well be Idaho.

10:25.258 --> 10:27.427
(clears throat)

10:27.460 --> 10:29.329
Broken hearts are no picnic.

10:29.362 --> 10:31.865
This town takes football
really seriously.

10:31.899 --> 10:34.067
I don't want
to let everybody down.

10:34.101 --> 10:36.737
Please tell me there's
a pill I can take

10:36.770 --> 10:37.971
to make this all go away.

10:38.005 --> 10:39.740
Legally no.

10:39.773 --> 10:41.308
And they make you
real thirsty.

10:41.341 --> 10:45.278
Sadly, only time
can heal the heart.

10:45.312 --> 10:47.715
Meanwhile, you have to kick.

10:47.748 --> 10:49.149
I can't kick without Lynette.

10:49.182 --> 10:51.418
She was like your lucky charm?

10:51.451 --> 10:53.253
Exactly.
Well,

10:53.286 --> 10:55.122
what helped you
kick before Lynette?

10:55.155 --> 10:56.757
Michelle?

10:56.790 --> 11:01.328
And before her, Kim.
Then Jemma.

11:01.361 --> 11:05.032
Then Vanessa...
or was it-was it Brandy?

11:05.065 --> 11:07.801
Sounds like having
a special someone

11:07.835 --> 11:10.403
in your life
gives you confidence.

11:10.437 --> 11:13.340
Yeah, I think you're right.

11:13.373 --> 11:16.443
You know, you are
a special guy, Max.

11:16.476 --> 11:19.179
And you need to find yourself
an equally special girl.

11:19.212 --> 11:23.183
As a matter of fact,
someone smart, funny

11:23.216 --> 11:25.919
and adorable might be
right under your nose.

11:25.953 --> 11:27.888
And I think you know
who I'm talking about.

11:27.921 --> 11:29.189
I think I do.

11:29.222 --> 11:32.793
Well, I have said too much
already. I should go.

11:32.826 --> 11:34.795
(chuckles) Don't put so much
pressure on yourself.

11:58.518 --> 12:02.823
Um, I'll take two dozen
of these sirloins, please.

12:04.491 --> 12:05.926
Oh, perfect.

12:05.959 --> 12:08.829
My, my, someone's hungry.

12:08.862 --> 12:10.330
I'm... gonna
freeze them!

12:10.363 --> 12:12.833
You just can't
beat this price!

12:12.866 --> 12:14.367
Or you could just serve them
at Judge Perkins's

12:14.401 --> 12:18.505
birthday party tomorrow night.
I mean, they'd be perfect.

12:18.538 --> 12:21.208
Lemon, I am so sorry I didn't
tell you this morning.

12:21.241 --> 12:23.811
You just caught me
by surprise is all,

12:23.844 --> 12:26.479
and after the divorce,
I was just so excited

12:26.513 --> 12:29.049
to finally have
something all mine.

12:29.082 --> 12:30.450
You don't have
to apologize.

12:30.483 --> 12:33.186
You are much more suited to
being a caterer than I am.

12:33.220 --> 12:35.522
I mean, after all the mental
stimulation of running

12:35.555 --> 12:39.126
a political campaign, I'm sure
I just would have been bored.

12:39.159 --> 12:43.163
I am truly blessed
with your friendship.

12:43.196 --> 12:44.397
You are always so supportive.

12:44.431 --> 12:46.566
I just wish that
you hadn't deceived me

12:46.599 --> 12:50.137
and robbed me of the opportunity
to be even more supportive.

12:50.170 --> 12:52.039
Mm. Thank you.
This much is fine.

12:52.072 --> 12:53.240
Well, good luck
tomorrow night.

12:53.273 --> 12:55.142
I'm sure that you will be
a huge success.

12:55.175 --> 12:57.210
Thank you, Lemon. You
could teach a class

12:57.244 --> 12:58.411
on how to be
a good friend.

12:58.445 --> 13:01.314
Oh, I would, but I bet you are
probably already teaching one.

13:01.348 --> 13:02.850
(both laugh)

13:08.288 --> 13:10.090
(sighs)

13:10.123 --> 13:11.524
You know, until you came,

13:11.558 --> 13:15.562
Lavon Hayes had a
98.7% approval rate.

13:15.595 --> 13:19.399
Now I know who
the other 1.3% was!
Oh.

13:19.432 --> 13:21.201
Man, your grandpa
really hates me!

13:21.234 --> 13:22.435
Honey, don't feel special--

13:22.469 --> 13:24.938
Grandpa hates
a lot of people.

13:24.972 --> 13:27.240
Yeah, but you know,
in high school, we were tight.

13:27.274 --> 13:28.942
He used to take me fishing and

13:28.976 --> 13:32.045
tell me stories
about the Korean War

13:32.079 --> 13:33.480
and the dangers of Communism.

13:33.513 --> 13:36.549
I thought you said
that it doesn't matter

13:36.583 --> 13:38.051
what people think
about us.

13:38.085 --> 13:40.320
This is family.

13:40.353 --> 13:42.189
Hey, you know what? Bring
him to lunch tomorrow.

13:42.222 --> 13:44.457
Let me charm
the pants off of him.

13:44.491 --> 13:46.593
Oh, gosh, you have
not seen Grandpa

13:46.626 --> 13:49.062
walk around the house
without his pants. Uh-uh.

13:49.096 --> 13:50.998
Listen, he'll come around
in his own time.

13:51.031 --> 13:52.432
We push, we could make
things worse.

13:52.465 --> 13:54.167
I'll make my mama's
buttermilk biscuits.

13:54.201 --> 13:58.038
Yeah. One bite and he'll
have nothing but love
for Lavon Hayes.

13:58.071 --> 14:00.073
(sighs) Come on.

14:00.107 --> 14:02.943
I just want to make things right
between him and me.

14:02.976 --> 14:04.244
For us.

14:04.277 --> 14:06.413
Please?

14:06.446 --> 14:07.380
Pretty please?

14:07.414 --> 14:08.348
All right, fine.

14:08.381 --> 14:10.317
But you better wear something
waterproof.

14:10.350 --> 14:12.552
I heard that.

14:12.585 --> 14:14.121
Man...

14:19.559 --> 14:21.895
Hey, Lemon,
you got a second?

14:21.929 --> 14:25.565
Oh, yes. Let me just
press "save."

14:25.598 --> 14:27.935
Writing my résumé is so
much fun. (giggles)

14:27.968 --> 14:29.302
What's going on?

14:29.336 --> 14:30.971
Um, Judge Perkins
just doubled

14:31.004 --> 14:33.240
the guest list
for the party tonight.

14:33.273 --> 14:35.008
And, well, I called
AnnaBeth to tell here,

14:35.042 --> 14:37.110
and she let out this
little squeak of terror.

14:37.144 --> 14:38.645
(chuckles)

14:38.678 --> 14:39.646
What?

14:39.679 --> 14:41.448
Oh, nothing.

14:41.481 --> 14:44.184
It's just the word "squeak."
It makes me laugh.

14:44.217 --> 14:45.185
(both chuckle)

14:45.218 --> 14:46.987
Right. Um, well, I'm worried

14:47.020 --> 14:49.957
that AnnaBeth might be in
over her head just a little bit,

14:49.990 --> 14:53.026
and I need this party
to be a home run.

14:53.060 --> 14:56.263
And, well, you are the Babe Ruth
of party planning.

14:56.296 --> 14:58.999
And I was wondering
if you could

14:59.032 --> 15:01.301
please, please, please
help her out?

15:01.334 --> 15:03.136
AnnaBeth wants to do this
on her own,

15:03.170 --> 15:04.704
and I must respect her wishes.

15:04.737 --> 15:07.574
Uh, you could help me out.

15:09.509 --> 15:11.578
Her or me.

15:11.611 --> 15:13.380
Really, whichever one
you prefer.

15:14.481 --> 15:16.616
I think it's a tie.

15:20.387 --> 15:22.322
(music playing,
people chattering)

15:23.590 --> 15:26.493
Bartender, a glass of pinot.

15:26.526 --> 15:28.962
For the millionth time,
we got red, we got white, so...

15:28.996 --> 15:31.098
I know, I just miss
saying it. Red.

15:31.131 --> 15:32.232
All right.

15:32.265 --> 15:33.566
You're in a good mood.

15:33.600 --> 15:35.002
I cured some foot fungus,
Wow.

15:35.035 --> 15:37.137
began to break through
a kid's mental block,

15:37.170 --> 15:39.606
all while doing a little
matchmaking in the process.

15:39.639 --> 15:41.074
A good day's work.

15:41.108 --> 15:42.442
And you haven't even opened
my present yet.

15:42.475 --> 15:44.444
What's this for?

15:44.477 --> 15:46.213
You said you wanted romance,
I listened.

15:50.750 --> 15:52.552
And it glows in the dark.

15:54.054 --> 15:56.756
Good, well, you can use it
to light your way back

15:56.789 --> 15:58.725
to your own bed tonight.

15:58.758 --> 16:00.627
Now if you'll excuse me,
I'm meeting Rose for dinner.

16:02.695 --> 16:05.198
So did you see Max?
Did you talk to him?

16:05.232 --> 16:06.599
Did he mention me?
Does he have nice feet?

16:06.633 --> 16:09.169
Yes, yes,
doctor-patient confidentiality.

16:09.202 --> 16:10.570
Tell me everything.

16:10.603 --> 16:11.704
Start from the beginning.
Oh, but wait, wait, wait.

16:11.738 --> 16:13.773
I'm gonna close my eyes
and pretend like I was there.

16:13.806 --> 16:16.543
("A Bad Case of Loving You"
begins playing)

16:25.552 --> 16:26.553
It's a flash mob!

16:26.586 --> 16:29.122
* A hot summer night

16:29.156 --> 16:31.091
* Fell like a net

16:33.193 --> 16:38.231
* I've gotta fi-i-i-ind
my baby yet *

16:38.265 --> 16:40.033
* A pretty face

16:40.067 --> 16:41.168
* A pretty face, girl *

16:41.201 --> 16:42.069
* Don't make
no pretty heart *

16:42.102 --> 16:44.104
* Don't make no pretty heart *

16:44.137 --> 16:47.040
* I learned that, baby

16:47.074 --> 16:48.775
Zoe, this is all for you.

16:48.808 --> 16:51.778
* From the start,
start-start-start *

16:51.811 --> 16:54.547
* Doctor, Doctor,
gimme the news *

16:54.581 --> 16:58.185
* I got a bad case
of lovin' you *

16:58.218 --> 17:00.553
* No, no,
no pill's gonna cure my ill *

17:00.587 --> 17:05.791
* I got a bad case
of lovin' you *

17:05.825 --> 17:08.560
* Doctor, Doctor,
gimme the news *

17:08.595 --> 17:11.298
* I got a bad case
of lovin' you *

17:11.330 --> 17:14.567
* No, no,
no pill's gonna cure my ill *

17:14.601 --> 17:18.271
* I got a bad case of lovin'

17:18.305 --> 17:21.308
* Lovin', lovin'

17:21.340 --> 17:23.242
* You.

17:23.276 --> 17:25.645
(song ends, applause)

17:25.678 --> 17:28.315
(cheering)

17:31.618 --> 17:32.819
Oh, romance.

17:32.852 --> 17:35.155
And just my luck, I'm too late.

17:39.226 --> 17:41.194
I'm going to fix this.

17:54.607 --> 17:56.576
Morning, Zoe.

17:56.609 --> 17:58.311
You've had a few deliveries.

17:58.345 --> 18:00.513
Rose, I am so sorry.

18:00.547 --> 18:01.781
Yesterday, when I went to Max

18:01.814 --> 18:04.884
to encourage him to find a new
good luck charm, I meant you.

18:04.917 --> 18:06.219
No, I get it.

18:06.253 --> 18:08.321
I mean, what guy
wouldn't fall for you?

18:08.355 --> 18:10.423
Anyway, I'm just going
to become a nun,

18:10.457 --> 18:11.591
but maybe they'll let me
out of the convent

18:11.624 --> 18:12.725
to come to your wedding.

18:12.759 --> 18:15.495
Uh, I've got a
delivery for...

18:15.528 --> 18:17.630
Oh, my God, how much allowance
does that kid get?

18:21.868 --> 18:24.671
Well, well, well.

18:24.704 --> 18:26.873
I heard all about
your new fella.

18:26.906 --> 18:29.642
Hey, do you know what you're
gonna wear to the prom?

18:29.676 --> 18:32.145
I've got the situation
under control.

18:32.179 --> 18:33.813
I'm going to find Max
today and explain to him

18:33.846 --> 18:35.148
why his feelings
are misplaced.

18:35.182 --> 18:37.484
Oh, no, you will not.

18:37.517 --> 18:40.887
This morning, at practice,
he kicked a 50 yarder.

18:40.920 --> 18:42.555
He's found his mojo again,

18:42.589 --> 18:44.824
and unexplainably,
it is you.

18:44.857 --> 18:47.294
That mojo has to stay
until after the Thurlow game.

18:47.327 --> 18:49.162
But that is insane.

18:49.196 --> 18:50.763
And maybe illegal.

18:50.797 --> 18:52.499
It's humane.

18:52.532 --> 18:54.534
You're gonna break this kid's
heart one way or the other.

18:54.567 --> 18:56.536
If you tell him tomorrow,
at least he's already

18:56.569 --> 18:59.906
helped his team and the town
to win the big game.

18:59.939 --> 19:01.574
I'm not going to string along
a 15-year-old boy

19:01.608 --> 19:03.476
just because he thinks
he's in love with me.

19:03.510 --> 19:05.845
Oh, no?
No.

19:05.878 --> 19:07.314
After Max's serenade
at the Rammer Jammer,

19:07.347 --> 19:08.515
the whole town
already knows

19:08.548 --> 19:09.649
you're the reason
he's kicking again.

19:09.682 --> 19:11.484
So who do you think they're
going to blame if he stops?

19:11.518 --> 19:13.420
(sighs heavily)

19:15.388 --> 19:17.524
Tell Rose to cancel my patients.

19:17.557 --> 19:19.259
I'm going off the grid.

19:24.831 --> 19:26.766
Another thing--
you need to close that new road.

19:26.799 --> 19:29.802
Come summer, we'll be covered
in tourists like bees on honey.

19:29.836 --> 19:32.439
Tourism brings money
to this town, Grandpa.

19:32.472 --> 19:36.209
They also hog the best
benches on the square.

19:36.243 --> 19:39.312
I appreciate you bringing that
to my attention, Sergeant.

19:39.346 --> 19:40.680
Not that you're going to
do anything about it.

19:40.713 --> 19:43.416
(clears throat)
Doesn't Lavon have a nice home?

19:43.450 --> 19:45.618
It is much nicer
with the two of you in it.

19:45.652 --> 19:47.854
I don't know, there's
something sad about it.

19:47.887 --> 19:50.723
All those trophies
from your glory days,

19:50.757 --> 19:52.525
reminding you you're
a has-been.

19:52.559 --> 19:53.960
Grandpa.

19:53.993 --> 19:55.695
Oh, now, Ruby, it's okay.

19:55.728 --> 19:58.331
The man is entitled
to his opinion.

19:58.365 --> 19:59.466
Uh-uh-uh-uh.

19:59.499 --> 20:00.833
Hands off the granddaughter.

20:00.867 --> 20:03.303
Just pretend she's
that last pass

20:03.336 --> 20:06.573
during the Georgia
game, and drop her.

20:06.606 --> 20:08.775
(Ruby clears her throat)

20:08.808 --> 20:11.311
Biscuits, Sergeant?
Oh.

20:11.344 --> 20:13.480
My mama's secret recipe.

20:13.513 --> 20:15.915
Oh.
And it'll help you
keep your mouth busy.

20:20.653 --> 20:22.655
Where did your mom learn to
cook, the British Navy?

20:22.689 --> 20:24.491
What? No.

20:24.524 --> 20:26.859
No, no, no!

20:26.893 --> 20:28.461
Now, you can insult
my leadership,

20:28.495 --> 20:30.597
you can even insult
my football career,

20:30.630 --> 20:32.865
but not my mama's cooking.
Not under my roof. Uh-uh.

20:32.899 --> 20:34.734
I didn't want to
come here anyway.

20:34.767 --> 20:35.668
Ain't nobody keeping you.

20:35.702 --> 20:37.504
Try any door,
see how it works out for you.

20:37.537 --> 20:39.739
Grandpa. Oh!
Burt Reynolds!

20:39.772 --> 20:40.873
Grandpa.

20:40.907 --> 20:42.309
(scoffs)

20:42.342 --> 20:43.876
You happy, Lavon?

20:43.910 --> 20:45.378
See? Worse.

20:51.050 --> 20:52.485
CRICKET:
Start plating the mushrooms.

20:52.519 --> 20:56.289
Oh, remember,
water glasses on the right.

20:56.323 --> 21:00.427
Oh, no,
I forgot to preheat the oven.

21:00.460 --> 21:01.761
350, right?

21:01.794 --> 21:02.895
Oh, Crickett, thank you.

21:02.929 --> 21:05.498
I am so lucky that you called
and offered your help.

21:05.532 --> 21:07.500
Well, I can sense a Belle
in need

21:07.534 --> 21:09.436
like a disturbance in the Force.

21:09.469 --> 21:13.540
You know, I think I should
polish the silverware.

21:13.573 --> 21:15.442
Oh, that's a great idea.

21:15.475 --> 21:17.410
Whoa.

21:17.444 --> 21:18.778
Wait, no.

21:18.811 --> 21:20.313
These are blue hydrangeas.

21:20.347 --> 21:21.681
I ordered white.

21:21.714 --> 21:23.850
Crickett called
and changed the order.

21:23.883 --> 21:26.586
I thought the blue looked better
with the tablecloths.

21:27.687 --> 21:29.989
You know, you're right.

21:30.022 --> 21:32.392
Crickett, where on Earth

21:32.425 --> 21:34.026
did you get such a head
for entertaining?

21:34.060 --> 21:36.929
Oh, I have a great many talents
you do not know about.

21:39.699 --> 21:41.401
Mmm, no, you don't.

21:41.434 --> 21:43.302
Well, I might.

21:45.972 --> 21:47.807
All right, where is she?

21:47.840 --> 21:48.975
Who?

21:49.008 --> 21:51.110
Abort, abort, abort.

21:51.143 --> 21:52.679
Oh, Lemon Breeland!

21:52.712 --> 21:54.113
(feedback screeches,
Lemon cries out)

21:54.146 --> 21:56.082
Not so fast.
Get over here.

21:56.115 --> 21:57.984
Okay, listen,
before you blow a gasket,

21:58.017 --> 22:00.086
all right,
George asked me to be here.

22:00.119 --> 22:02.355
This is a very important
event for him.

22:02.389 --> 22:03.856
It's really important
to me, too.

22:03.890 --> 22:05.024
Well, then be honest.

22:05.057 --> 22:06.493
You need my help.

22:08.828 --> 22:10.730
Well, he added
30 people!

22:10.763 --> 22:12.965
Don't you worry, honey,
I got your back, okay?

22:12.999 --> 22:15.101
T minus two hours,
people! I need someone

22:15.134 --> 22:16.636
on salads, someone
on silverware,

22:16.669 --> 22:17.737
and someone on sirloin.

22:17.770 --> 22:19.071
Stat! Go! Move!

22:29.048 --> 22:30.483
(knocking on door)

22:30.517 --> 22:32.084
WADE:
Hey, Zoe, open up.

22:32.118 --> 22:34.454
Come on, I know
you're in there.

22:37.023 --> 22:38.825
Hurry up, get inside.
Did anyone see you?

22:38.858 --> 22:39.759
Oh, yeah.

22:39.792 --> 22:40.760
Paparazzi

22:40.793 --> 22:42.595
camped out
in the bushes.

22:42.629 --> 22:44.130
What is going on?

22:44.163 --> 22:44.931
I'm hiding out from Max.

22:44.964 --> 22:46.165
He keeps declaring
his love to me,

22:46.198 --> 22:48.868
and I can't break his heart
until after the game tomorrow.

22:48.901 --> 22:50.670
Well, kid's got
serious dance moves.

22:50.703 --> 22:52.672
Might as well let him
get to first base.

22:52.705 --> 22:53.540
No!

22:53.573 --> 22:55.742
Quick hand up the skirt
and team wins,

22:55.775 --> 22:56.743
what's the harm?

22:56.776 --> 22:57.710
You think that's first base?

22:57.744 --> 22:58.978
Yeah, why?

22:59.011 --> 23:00.713
Nothing.
Just explains a lot.

23:00.747 --> 23:01.781
Look, at least

23:01.814 --> 23:02.749
Max's version of romance

23:02.782 --> 23:04.717
doesn't involve
glow-in-the-dark butt floss.

23:04.751 --> 23:06.586
You could learn
a few lessons from him.

23:06.619 --> 23:08.154
Hey.
(knocking on door)

23:08.187 --> 23:09.188
MAX:
Zoe, you in there?
Shh.

23:09.221 --> 23:10.957
Well, well, well.
Shh, shh.

23:10.990 --> 23:13.926
Shut up.
Class is in session.

23:13.960 --> 23:16.128
What are you doing?
What are you d...
Hey, Max!

23:16.162 --> 23:18.798
Wade.
Coming, buddy.

23:18.831 --> 23:20.533
Come on in.
Hey.

23:20.567 --> 23:22.034
Wade, is Zoe here?

23:22.068 --> 23:23.636
As a matter of fact, she is...

23:23.670 --> 23:25.872
right behind me.
(Zoe gasps)

23:25.905 --> 23:26.873
Hey, Max.

23:26.906 --> 23:28.174
What's up, brother?

23:28.207 --> 23:29.542
I was hoping we could talk.

23:29.576 --> 23:30.677
(sighs)
You know,

23:30.710 --> 23:32.812
I should probably
leave you two alone.

23:32.845 --> 23:33.913
I was starting to
feel like a bit

23:33.946 --> 23:35.682
of a third wheel anyway.

23:35.715 --> 23:37.984
Enjoy. Okay,
have a great time.

23:40.086 --> 23:42.822
Did you get my flowers?
(chuckles)

23:42.855 --> 23:43.923
Max, I'm-I'm...

23:43.956 --> 23:46.025
I'm flattered, but I am
twice your age.

23:46.058 --> 23:47.960
Oh, no, no, no.
Demi and Ashton made it work.

23:47.994 --> 23:49.195
Uh, okay,

23:49.228 --> 23:51.864
longer than anybody
expected. Look,

23:51.898 --> 23:53.533
I know I'm in high
school, and you're...

23:53.566 --> 23:54.934
not, but...

23:54.967 --> 23:57.069
please, just go to dinner
with me tonight.
Max,

23:57.103 --> 23:58.471
I would love to.

23:58.505 --> 23:59.939
But I have to work tonight.

23:59.972 --> 24:02.008
You know, I-I am a doctor,

24:02.041 --> 24:04.611
so I have to deliver a baby.

24:04.644 --> 24:06.212
The Smitherman baby,
and the hospital

24:06.245 --> 24:08.815
is in Mobile, so I really
should get going.

24:10.082 --> 24:11.050
Hey, Doc.
Great news.

24:11.083 --> 24:13.052
Smithermans delivered
the baby in a bathtub.

24:13.085 --> 24:15.187
You don't have
to go in.
Great!

24:15.221 --> 24:16.923
Then I'll pick you up at 8:00.

24:16.956 --> 24:17.957
(chuckles)

24:17.990 --> 24:19.826
(gasps)
Oh, and, um,

24:19.859 --> 24:21.027
when I... when I
say pick you up,

24:21.060 --> 24:22.862
I-I-I'll just
be walking.

24:24.531 --> 24:27.099
But I'm four months away from
getting my license, so...

24:27.133 --> 24:29.836
Max...
It's a date.
She'll see you then.

24:29.869 --> 24:31.838
All right.
Run along now, pal.

24:31.871 --> 24:33.540
Five bucks says
he brings you a corsage.

24:33.573 --> 24:34.574
Mm-hmm.
I hate you.

24:34.607 --> 24:35.942
No, you don't. Come on.
Get out!

24:35.975 --> 24:36.976
All right.
Out!

24:37.009 --> 24:38.511
(Wade laughs)

24:52.024 --> 24:53.626
I brought you
something.

24:53.660 --> 24:55.127
Oh, you shouldn't have.

24:55.161 --> 24:56.796
This corsage is plenty.

24:56.829 --> 24:58.665
Come to my game tomorrow?

24:58.698 --> 25:00.533
I saved you a seat,
uh, in the front row,

25:00.567 --> 25:01.534
right next to my dad.

25:01.568 --> 25:02.969
'Cause that wouldn't
be awkward.

25:03.002 --> 25:05.772
All right,
red wine for the lady,

25:05.805 --> 25:07.640
and a root beer

25:07.674 --> 25:09.809
for the well-dressed
young man.

25:09.842 --> 25:10.977
Wade, we didn't order these.
Oh,

25:11.010 --> 25:11.978
that's all right.
Brick, uh,

25:12.011 --> 25:12.912
sent 'em over.

25:16.783 --> 25:19.118
We should order.

25:19.151 --> 25:21.120
N-Now, this is my treat.

25:21.153 --> 25:25.024
Though we can only
spend, um... $23.

25:25.057 --> 25:26.993
I blew the rest of my
allowance on flowers.

25:27.026 --> 25:29.295
(chuckles)

25:29.328 --> 25:31.063
'Kay.

25:37.770 --> 25:38.971
(clears throat)
Sergeant,

25:39.005 --> 25:40.172
I-I need to speak with you.

25:40.206 --> 25:42.208
Am I gonna have to get my hose?
Look,

25:42.241 --> 25:43.743
I'm sorry about earlier, okay?

25:45.144 --> 25:46.746
You remember years ago, when...

25:46.779 --> 25:48.214
Ruby and I first started dating,

25:48.247 --> 25:49.682
you took me

25:49.716 --> 25:50.717
fishing at Dogwood Creek?

25:50.750 --> 25:53.620
I should've kept the fish
and tossed you back.

25:53.653 --> 25:54.887
(chuckles nervously)

25:54.921 --> 25:57.056
On the ride up, you said,

25:57.089 --> 25:59.058
"Son, if you hurt Ruby,

25:59.091 --> 26:00.660
I'm gonna hurt you."

26:01.961 --> 26:04.296
Looked like you were
about to mess your pants.

26:04.330 --> 26:05.364
Felt that way, too.

26:05.397 --> 26:06.933
(chuckles)
Yeah,

26:06.966 --> 26:08.167
but after that
we had a great time.

26:10.402 --> 26:13.305
Okay, then a year later I went
away to college and I hurt Ruby.

26:13.339 --> 26:14.774
And I think

26:14.807 --> 26:16.743
you've been trying
to hurt me back ever since.

26:16.776 --> 26:17.977
Am I right?
What is this?

26:18.010 --> 26:19.211
Some kind of interrogation?
I don't have

26:19.245 --> 26:20.279
to answer your questions.
Look,

26:20.312 --> 26:21.280
look, I'm a different man now.

26:21.313 --> 26:23.850
So wh-what can I do to get you
to forgive me?

26:24.984 --> 26:26.819
Oh.

26:26.853 --> 26:29.055
Well...

26:29.088 --> 26:31.624
a tree fell down in the back.
You can, uh...

26:31.658 --> 26:32.825
chop that up into firewood.

26:34.894 --> 26:35.995
Seriously?

26:36.028 --> 26:37.096
Yeah.
Okay.

26:37.129 --> 26:38.631
Done.

26:38.665 --> 26:40.032
(chuckles)
Hey, hey, and, uh,

26:40.066 --> 26:41.100
you can...

26:41.133 --> 26:42.835
unclog my septic tank.

26:44.036 --> 26:45.204
Here, I'll just, uh...

26:45.237 --> 26:46.338
I'll just make you a list.

26:48.775 --> 26:50.409
Guests are all seated.

26:50.442 --> 26:52.278
30 seconds until first course!

26:52.311 --> 26:54.747
Uh, could everyone gather
round and join hands?

26:54.781 --> 26:56.916
Ooh, I feel like
one of Katy Perry's

26:56.949 --> 26:58.718
backup dancers.
15 seconds.

26:58.751 --> 27:01.287
I would like to thank all
of you. This is a very

27:01.320 --> 27:03.322
special moment for me.
It's always been

27:03.355 --> 27:05.658
a dream of mine to...
Okay, time's up!

27:05.692 --> 27:07.359
All right, let's get those
salads out there, people.

27:07.393 --> 27:08.828
You remember,
you lean

27:08.861 --> 27:10.897
from the left.
No smiling, no frowning,

27:10.930 --> 27:11.964
no facial expressions.

27:11.998 --> 27:13.399
Now, go.

27:13.432 --> 27:15.267
Thank you for
all your help,

27:15.301 --> 27:17.303
but I can handle
everything from here.

27:17.336 --> 27:19.271
Oh, that's not necessary.
I'll stay till dessert.

27:19.305 --> 27:21.073
Plating cheesecake--
it's... tricky.

27:21.107 --> 27:22.809
I said I've got it.

27:24.476 --> 27:25.878
AnnaBeth...

27:26.979 --> 27:29.015
I was having a prayer circle.

27:29.048 --> 27:30.917
My prayer circle, my night.

27:30.950 --> 27:32.384
George asked me for his help,

27:32.418 --> 27:34.420
because he obviously knew
that you needed it.

27:34.453 --> 27:37.890
And you couldn't wait to horn
in, because you cannot stand

27:37.924 --> 27:39.959
that I started this business
without you.

27:39.992 --> 27:42.028
Because we have dreamed
about doing this together

27:42.061 --> 27:43.362
ever since we opened up...

27:43.395 --> 27:45.164
Lemon's Lemonade!
I remember.

27:45.197 --> 27:47.033
I also remember
wanting to offer

27:47.066 --> 27:48.400
AnnaBeth's Apple Juice,
but you said

27:48.434 --> 27:50.469
it would be too confusing
for the customers!

27:50.502 --> 27:52.104
We live among simple people.

27:52.138 --> 27:53.005
This is why I didn't want to...

27:53.039 --> 27:54.440
Good news, the judge loved
his mini...

27:54.473 --> 27:56.075
quiches.
Everything has
to be your way,

27:56.108 --> 27:57.309
bossing everybody around.

27:57.343 --> 27:59.111
If you really wanted
AnnaBeth's Apple Juice,

27:59.145 --> 27:59.946
you should've
fought for it.

27:59.979 --> 28:02.114
Instead of letting
your resentment just

28:02.148 --> 28:04.784
grow and fester for 20 years
until it ruins our friendship!

28:04.817 --> 28:06.853
Ladies...
You will not
put this on me.

28:06.886 --> 28:08.320
You are ruining our friendship,

28:08.354 --> 28:09.021
What?!
because you can't

28:09.055 --> 28:10.823
handle when I stand up to you,

28:10.857 --> 28:12.458
which is now a total of twice!
What?!

28:12.491 --> 28:14.160
Okay.

28:14.193 --> 28:15.294
There we go.

28:15.327 --> 28:16.763
Doesn't it feel good

28:16.796 --> 28:18.064
to-to get everything
out there,

28:18.097 --> 28:19.465
to clear the air?

28:19.498 --> 28:20.767
Now, can we...

28:20.800 --> 28:22.001
get back to work, please?

28:22.034 --> 28:23.269
LEMON:
Good luck cutting

28:23.302 --> 28:25.137
clean slices out of
those cheesecakes, missy.

28:25.171 --> 28:27.473
It's a knife and hot water.

28:27.506 --> 28:30.242
It's not the secret
to nuclear fusion!

28:30.276 --> 28:31.343
(stomps foot)
Oh!

28:31.377 --> 28:32.444
GEORGE:
Lemon. AnnaBeth,

28:32.478 --> 28:33.512
I... Lemon...

28:33.545 --> 28:35.481
Mm... Oh, boy.

28:42.855 --> 28:44.824
You are...

28:44.857 --> 28:45.925
magnificent.

28:46.993 --> 28:48.394
(mouth full):
Thank you.

28:48.427 --> 28:49.528
MAX:
A-And I'm not

28:49.561 --> 28:51.430
just talking
about your kind eyes.

28:51.463 --> 28:52.865
Or your glowy,
dew-kissed skin.

28:52.899 --> 28:54.500
I'm talking
about your brain.

28:55.802 --> 28:56.869
Thanks, Max.

28:56.903 --> 28:58.104
That is nice to hear.
You know,

28:58.137 --> 28:59.839
y-you're all of
those things

28:59.872 --> 29:01.007
and a damn good doctor.

29:01.040 --> 29:02.408
I mean.. I mean,
m-my feet...

29:02.441 --> 29:04.010
Would you excuse me a moment?

29:06.979 --> 29:07.880
ROSE:
Looks like

29:07.914 --> 29:10.182
you two are going steady.
Congratulations.

29:10.216 --> 29:11.884
No, Rose, I do not even
want to be here.

29:11.918 --> 29:14.020
Oh, so it's Rose's fault
you're on a date with her man?

29:14.053 --> 29:16.255
No, but, look, if I break
his heart now, we might lose.

29:16.288 --> 29:18.190
You're smart. You went
to college for, like, ever.

29:18.224 --> 29:20.159
If you wanted to end it,
you could figure out how.

29:20.192 --> 29:21.260
Burn.

29:22.361 --> 29:23.429
Let's go, Tonya.

29:23.462 --> 29:24.964
I've lost my appetite.

29:24.997 --> 29:27.566
FYI, cougar is not
a good look on you.

29:27.599 --> 29:30.169
WADE:
Ooh, man.

29:30.202 --> 29:31.503
Mean.

29:31.537 --> 29:33.940
Thanks, Wade.
Thanks a lot.

29:33.973 --> 29:35.908
What did I do?

29:37.043 --> 29:38.978
*

29:49.588 --> 29:51.490
Oh.

29:51.523 --> 29:53.592
So... uh...

29:53.625 --> 29:55.561
if we win tomorrow, uh...

29:55.594 --> 29:57.429
there'll be
a victory bonfire.

29:57.463 --> 30:00.166
I was... I was thinking
we maybe could go.

30:00.199 --> 30:02.534
Max, I can't go on any
more dates with you.

30:02.568 --> 30:04.303
Look, I shouldn't have
gone on this one.

30:04.336 --> 30:06.038
It's wrong.

30:06.072 --> 30:07.439
W... It's...

30:07.473 --> 30:09.208
It's not...

30:09.241 --> 30:11.443
How can something so wrong
feel so right?

30:11.477 --> 30:13.980
You made me want
to be a better man.

30:14.013 --> 30:15.081
Max...

30:16.215 --> 30:17.483
...that's not possible.

30:17.516 --> 30:20.052
Oh, thank you.

30:20.086 --> 30:21.387
No, because you're-you're
not a man.

30:22.554 --> 30:23.923
Yet.

30:23.956 --> 30:25.257
Look, Max, I know

30:25.291 --> 30:27.593
you feel like we had
a connection yesterday,

30:27.626 --> 30:30.296
but you were just still in a
lot of pain from your breakup

30:30.329 --> 30:31.964
with Lynette, and you're
transferring those feelings

30:31.998 --> 30:32.965
to me.
No, no,

30:32.999 --> 30:34.600
look, that was just puppy love,
this is real.

30:34.633 --> 30:36.102
Zoe,

30:36.135 --> 30:38.137
we can make this work.

30:38.170 --> 30:39.438
C-Can I kiss you?

30:39.471 --> 30:41.240
No, Max! Look,
I only went

30:41.273 --> 30:42.975
on this date with you
because everyone in town

30:43.009 --> 30:44.410
wants you to kick
that football tomorrow.

30:46.378 --> 30:49.248
I'm sorry.
You are an amazing kid.

30:52.051 --> 30:54.286
You know what?

30:54.320 --> 30:56.255
As a good luck charm,
you really suck.

30:57.356 --> 30:59.992
And...

31:00.026 --> 31:03.462
you should've waited to tell me
till after the game.

31:16.575 --> 31:18.510
(chatter)

31:21.613 --> 31:24.350
(booing and hissing)

31:26.118 --> 31:28.420
(clears throat, chuckles)
(Zoe sighs)

31:28.454 --> 31:29.155
Hello, Dr. Hart.
You know,

31:29.188 --> 31:31.090
I am pretty used
to everyone here

31:31.123 --> 31:32.624
hating me for one reason
or another

31:32.658 --> 31:34.693
but for not dating a minor?
That's new.

31:34.726 --> 31:37.229
You could've waited
one more day.
Oh, my God,

31:37.263 --> 31:38.197
you too?
Hey, you wanted me

31:38.230 --> 31:40.232
to date. I'm just asking
for the same thing.

31:40.266 --> 31:41.433
That is not funny.

31:41.467 --> 31:42.334
I'll tell you what,

31:42.368 --> 31:44.203
if you need any, uh,
legal protection,

31:44.236 --> 31:45.404
you just give me a call.

31:45.437 --> 31:47.206
Ha-ha.
(George laughs)

31:48.707 --> 31:50.109
I am not in the mood.
I come

31:50.142 --> 31:52.544
in peace, Doc.
I come in peace.

31:52.578 --> 31:54.013
You know, I think you
did the right thing

31:54.046 --> 31:55.147
last night, uh,

31:55.181 --> 31:56.382
breaking that kid's heart
and all.

31:56.415 --> 31:57.283
You do?

31:57.316 --> 31:58.684
Heck, yeah.

31:58.717 --> 32:00.686
He's acting like he's the hero
in a romantic comedy.

32:00.719 --> 32:02.154
That ain't the way
the world works,

32:02.188 --> 32:03.622
all right?
You're just, you know...

32:03.655 --> 32:04.690
toughening him up.

32:04.723 --> 32:06.292
He's already tough.

32:06.325 --> 32:08.294
You know, it takes guts
to do what Max did.

32:08.327 --> 32:09.962
He really put himself
out there.

32:09.996 --> 32:11.663
Come on. He was...
prancing around here,

32:11.697 --> 32:13.699
making a damn fool
out of himself.
No.

32:13.732 --> 32:15.701
Was it over-the-top?

32:15.734 --> 32:18.037
Yes. But was it nice
to be appreciated?

32:18.070 --> 32:19.538
Absolutely.

32:19.571 --> 32:21.073
You know, in the end,

32:21.107 --> 32:23.609
that is all a romantic gesture
is meant to do.

32:23.642 --> 32:25.311
At least he took a chance.

32:27.346 --> 32:29.248
Hey...

32:33.752 --> 32:35.687
(groans)

32:37.723 --> 32:39.625
(sighs)

32:46.398 --> 32:47.333
I finished.

32:47.366 --> 32:48.534
Stayed up all night...

32:49.668 --> 32:52.238
...almost got bit
by a mean-ass raccoon.

32:52.271 --> 32:53.472
That's how important

32:53.505 --> 32:55.174
it is for me to earn
your forgiveness.

32:56.275 --> 32:58.044
I forgave you
a long time ago.

32:58.077 --> 32:59.345
What?
Mmm.

32:59.378 --> 33:01.480
Why'd you ask me to do
all them chores?

33:01.513 --> 33:03.982
I didn't want to do them and
I'm too cheap to pay somebody.

33:05.084 --> 33:08.320
Look, you dumping my grandbaby
back then was a gift.

33:08.354 --> 33:09.555
It freed her
from following your dreams

33:09.588 --> 33:11.723
so she could follow
her own.

33:11.757 --> 33:13.392
And now your
grandbaby's back here

33:13.425 --> 33:15.427
and staying here
because of me,

33:15.461 --> 33:16.528
so you should thank me.

33:16.562 --> 33:20.199
I don't want Ruby
tied down here.

33:20.232 --> 33:22.034
She's always dreamed
bigger than BlueBell.

33:22.068 --> 33:24.136
Just because
one of her dreams

33:24.170 --> 33:26.405
came true doesn't mean
she's stopped dreaming.

33:26.438 --> 33:29.541
Now, thanks
for your help

33:29.575 --> 33:32.578
and don't drink out of my hose.

33:37.549 --> 33:40.419
Last night was a huge success.

33:40.452 --> 33:41.387
The judge had
three helpings.

33:41.420 --> 33:44.423
This morning he called me
G-Tuck, which I hate

33:44.456 --> 33:46.725
but will grow to love,
I am sure.

33:46.758 --> 33:48.460
Well, I am so glad.

33:48.494 --> 33:51.497
I know there were a
few snafus, but...

33:51.530 --> 33:53.199
George, what was
so important that...?

33:54.433 --> 33:55.567
What is she doing here?

33:55.601 --> 33:57.569
I would like to ask
the same question.

33:57.603 --> 33:59.105
Lemon, if you,

33:59.138 --> 34:00.839
if you would
kindly just

34:00.872 --> 34:02.374
please...

34:04.676 --> 34:06.612
All right, listen,

34:06.645 --> 34:09.481
I was just telling AnnaBeth
how great last night went,

34:09.514 --> 34:11.483
and I owe it
to both of you.

34:11.516 --> 34:13.119
Very nice, now good-bye.
Thank you, can I go now?

34:13.152 --> 34:14.253
Ladies, listen.

34:14.286 --> 34:16.788
AnnaBeth, your cooking is
just this side of heaven.

34:16.822 --> 34:18.690
Oh, well, that's sweet.
Yeah,

34:18.724 --> 34:20.326
but you're terrible
at organization

34:20.359 --> 34:21.560
and time management.

34:21.592 --> 34:23.862
Lemon, you're organized,
you're disciplined,

34:23.895 --> 34:25.597
and you make
quick choices.

34:25.630 --> 34:26.665
Thank you.
(chuckles)

34:26.697 --> 34:27.866
But your mini quiches
cannot hold a candle to hers.

34:27.899 --> 34:31.837
(gasps)
You love my mini quiches,
you always said so.

34:31.870 --> 34:33.639
And now I don't have to.

34:33.672 --> 34:34.773
Hmm.

34:34.806 --> 34:37.176
Y'all two complement each
other, okay, you always have.

34:37.208 --> 34:39.245
Hmm, it's mostly me
complimenting her.

34:39.277 --> 34:41.713
No, no, no, no, I mean
"complementing,"

34:41.746 --> 34:43.181
like with an "E."
With an "E."

34:43.215 --> 34:44.183
It's-- uh, you know what?

34:44.216 --> 34:45.317
You fit together, okay?

34:45.351 --> 34:46.784
So why don't we

34:46.818 --> 34:49.455
just stop
all this silly fighting?

34:49.487 --> 34:52.224
And let's start working
together to make the best

34:52.257 --> 34:54.393
damn catering business
in Southern Alabama.

34:54.426 --> 34:55.793
What do you say?

34:57.896 --> 34:59.698
Or don't.

35:00.932 --> 35:02.834
I don't care.

35:02.868 --> 35:04.370
Now, if you'll excuse me,

35:04.403 --> 35:05.571
the big game is
about to start.

35:10.276 --> 35:12.211
(sighs)

35:18.317 --> 35:20.152
So you're really not playing?

35:20.186 --> 35:21.353
I'm not gonna go out there
and choke

35:21.387 --> 35:22.554
in front
of all those people.

35:22.588 --> 35:24.190
Thanks to you
and Lynette's parents,

35:24.223 --> 35:25.324
I am without a lucky charm.

35:25.357 --> 35:29.628
Max, all those girls--
they were just magic feathers.

35:29.661 --> 35:30.662
No, they were girls.

35:30.696 --> 35:33.332
No, I mean like in Dumbo.

35:33.365 --> 35:36.402
Something to cling to until
you could believe in yourself.

35:36.435 --> 35:37.403
I've seen Dumbo.

35:37.436 --> 35:39.705
Doesn't mean
I can kick the ball.

35:39.738 --> 35:43.709
Max, what you did-- pursuing
a woman twice your age

35:43.742 --> 35:45.677
and proving it by
dancing in front

35:45.711 --> 35:48.414
of the whole town-- I mean, that
is one of the bravest things

35:48.447 --> 35:49.815
that I have ever seen.

35:49.848 --> 35:51.883
Trust me, I
know grown men

35:51.917 --> 35:53.552
that can't do what you did.

35:54.886 --> 35:56.855
Really?

35:56.888 --> 35:58.724
Really.

35:58.757 --> 36:00.659
Some girl-- she is going
to be so lucky

36:00.692 --> 36:02.728
to be your girlfriend,
but this football game--

36:02.761 --> 36:05.431
this has nothing
to do with luck.

36:05.464 --> 36:06.665
This is all about bravery,

36:06.698 --> 36:08.400
so you need to
go out there,

36:08.434 --> 36:10.602
drown out the voices and the
crowd, look at that football,

36:10.636 --> 36:12.904
and kick the hell out of it.

36:12.938 --> 36:14.373
I've seen
you dance,

36:14.406 --> 36:16.542
so I know those feet--
they've got moves.

36:18.877 --> 36:20.846
Thanks.

36:20.879 --> 36:23.282
Go get 'em.

36:23.315 --> 36:25.217
(chuckles)
Aah!

36:34.726 --> 36:36.662
(clapping)

36:48.039 --> 36:49.441
(cheering)

36:52.511 --> 36:53.712
Zoe Hart,

36:53.745 --> 36:55.447
I don't know
what you did,

36:55.481 --> 36:56.582
but I could just kiss you.

36:56.615 --> 36:58.284
No need-- pat on
the back will do.

36:58.317 --> 36:59.451
(chuckles)

36:59.485 --> 37:01.320
Hey, did you see that game?

37:01.353 --> 37:04.290
Final play, Max kicks
a field goal to win it.

37:04.323 --> 37:05.591
He did great

37:05.624 --> 37:08.760
and, I must admit,
you did, too.

37:08.794 --> 37:11.363
Did you just pay me
a compliment?

37:11.397 --> 37:13.865
I do not need to
repeat myself.

37:15.901 --> 37:17.403
Rose.

37:17.436 --> 37:18.704
Rose, wait up.

37:18.737 --> 37:20.406
I am so, so sorry.

37:20.439 --> 37:22.641
I never meant for any
of this to happen.
I know.

37:22.674 --> 37:24.310
I just seem to
have a talent

37:24.343 --> 37:25.677
for liking boys who
love someone else.

37:25.711 --> 37:27.313
Want to talk about it
over a milk shake?

37:27.346 --> 37:28.314
I'll buy.

37:28.347 --> 37:30.015
Hey, Rose.

37:30.048 --> 37:32.618
Victory party at
Teddy's house.

37:32.651 --> 37:34.653
You should come.

37:34.686 --> 37:37.389
Oh, my God.
(gasps)

37:39.024 --> 37:40.992
LEMON:
Oh, George, there you are.

37:41.026 --> 37:43.862
Uh, we require
your legal counsel.

37:43.895 --> 37:46.932
Really, y'all can't settle
this without lawsuits?

37:46.965 --> 37:48.634
We're not suing each other.

37:48.667 --> 37:49.568
We're taking your advice

37:49.601 --> 37:52.037
and starting a business
together-- 50-50.

37:52.070 --> 37:53.439
Which is why

37:53.472 --> 37:55.374
we need you to draw up
the business agreement--

37:55.407 --> 37:58.577
for free, of course, since you
left me at the altar and all.

37:58.610 --> 38:00.612
Great.

38:00.646 --> 38:02.348
Great, that's
great news.

38:02.381 --> 38:03.248
It's a simple contract.

38:03.281 --> 38:05.050
I just need the, uh,
the company name.

38:05.083 --> 38:07.953
I was thinking maybe
L&A Catering.

38:07.986 --> 38:11.056
No, that sounds
too corporate and cold.

38:11.089 --> 38:12.858
How about,

38:12.891 --> 38:15.361
um, AnnaBeth's?

38:15.394 --> 38:16.862
Aw, really?

38:16.895 --> 38:17.896
(laughs)

38:17.929 --> 38:19.598
Okay, thanks.

38:19.631 --> 38:20.666
AnnaBeth's it is.

38:20.699 --> 38:22.000
Thank you.
All right.

38:22.033 --> 38:23.001
See y'all later.

38:23.034 --> 38:24.436
Bye.

38:24.470 --> 38:29.408
You said yes so quickly,
no "Oh, I couldn't."

38:29.441 --> 38:31.443
That's okay.

38:38.016 --> 38:41.387
Hey, Wanda, could I,
could I ask you something?

38:41.420 --> 38:42.421
Mm-hmm.

38:42.454 --> 38:44.590
Well, I got this friend,

38:44.623 --> 38:46.825
and he wants to do
something romantic

38:46.858 --> 38:49.895
for this girl
he's been hanging out with,

38:49.928 --> 38:51.797
you know, something to show
her he appreciates her.

38:51.830 --> 38:52.831
Aw, that's so sweet.

38:52.864 --> 38:56.535
Whatever-- I-I hate all
that mushy stuff, but, uh,

38:56.568 --> 38:57.869
I thought you might have
some ideas

38:57.903 --> 39:01.039
I could pass along to him.

39:01.072 --> 39:04.976
Hmm, well, Tom's always
doing small things

39:05.010 --> 39:08.580
like dedicating Celine Dion
songs to me on the radio.

39:08.614 --> 39:11.583
Oh, and he got us those
matching spray paint T-shirts

39:11.617 --> 39:12.851
they make at the fair.

39:12.884 --> 39:15.821
Yeah, I think
my friend would think

39:15.854 --> 39:17.456
those were
pretty terrible ideas.

39:17.489 --> 39:19.558
It really doesn't
matter what it is

39:19.591 --> 39:21.660
as long as it's
from the heart.

39:22.761 --> 39:24.996
Right.

39:25.030 --> 39:26.465
Hmm.

39:26.498 --> 39:28.600
Let's get 'em now,
let's get 'em.

39:28.634 --> 39:31.102
(laughing):
Go, go.

39:31.136 --> 39:32.938
Yeah.

39:32.971 --> 39:34.573
Oh, hey.

39:35.741 --> 39:37.876
You know, crazy thing
happened last night.

39:37.909 --> 39:42.514
While I was sleeping, elves
came in and mowed the yard,

39:42.548 --> 39:44.149
chopped firewood,
even fixed

39:44.182 --> 39:47.586
the squeaky screen door out
back so I can sneak out.

39:47.619 --> 39:48.754
You wouldn't happen
to know anything

39:48.787 --> 39:49.755
about that,
would you?

39:49.788 --> 39:51.623
I don't involve myself
with elves.

39:51.657 --> 39:52.624
(laughs)

39:52.658 --> 39:53.625
They creep me out.

39:53.659 --> 39:56.194
Grandpa will come around
eventually, I promise.

39:56.227 --> 39:57.195
Yeah.
He will.

39:57.228 --> 39:59.397
It just means so much
to me that you tried.

40:02.634 --> 40:05.170
You think you could be
happy here?

40:05.203 --> 40:06.204
In BlueBell?

40:06.237 --> 40:09.675
Whoa, where'd
that come from?

40:09.708 --> 40:11.042
I know how important
your career is,

40:11.076 --> 40:12.644
and I can't see you
running a corporation

40:12.678 --> 40:15.647
over the free WiFi
at the Butter Stick Bakery.

40:15.681 --> 40:18.049
I'm here now.

40:18.083 --> 40:19.150
Okay, that's all
that matters.

40:19.184 --> 40:20.652
Let's just take
it day by day.

40:20.686 --> 40:22.754
(giggles)
Yeah.

40:25.256 --> 40:27.225
I don't want
to hold you back, though.

40:27.258 --> 40:29.895
If I wanted out of
BlueBell, trust me,

40:29.928 --> 40:31.463
not even you could
hold me back.

40:31.497 --> 40:33.031
(both laugh)
That's true.

40:33.064 --> 40:35.033
I've had the high
pressure job,

40:35.066 --> 40:36.902
I've had the
expense account,

40:36.935 --> 40:37.903
the penthouse
apartment.

40:37.936 --> 40:38.937
I've had it all

40:38.970 --> 40:41.039
except for one thing.

40:41.072 --> 40:41.873
A boat?

40:41.907 --> 40:44.876
I've had a boat--
it's a lot of work.

40:46.277 --> 40:48.213
Love, silly.

40:52.718 --> 40:53.885
Done with that football?

40:53.919 --> 40:55.687
Mm-hmm, I'm done
with football.

40:55.721 --> 40:56.688
Mm-hmm?
Mm-hmm.

40:56.722 --> 40:57.956
(chuckles)
Mm-hmm.

41:09.267 --> 41:10.602
If you think the
cookies are a mess,

41:10.636 --> 41:11.937
you should see
Lavon's kitchen.

41:14.606 --> 41:17.676
I've never really
baked before.

41:17.709 --> 41:19.477
Black and white cookies.

41:20.612 --> 41:23.181
I can't believe
you did this.

41:23.214 --> 41:24.315
Thank you.

41:24.349 --> 41:26.652
Well, you don't have to make
such a big deal out of it.

41:26.685 --> 41:28.687
They probably suck.

41:28.720 --> 41:32.090
Mmm.
Definite-- okay,
they suck, all right.

41:32.123 --> 41:33.725
Just-- okay.

41:33.759 --> 41:35.727
(chuckles)

41:35.761 --> 41:37.629
It's the thought
that counts.

41:41.166 --> 41:43.602
So, uh...

41:44.703 --> 41:46.171
What do we...?

41:49.307 --> 41:51.009
Get naked?

41:51.042 --> 41:53.011
Thank God, I thought
you'd never ask.

41:53.044 --> 41:55.513
