03:16.450 --> 03:18.050
You see how it's done?

03:18.210 --> 03:20.770
Yeah, I think I got the hang of it.

03:20.930 --> 03:21.880
You better.

03:21.980 --> 03:25.580
The boss will chew my head off
if these cores get messed up.

03:25.770 --> 03:27.450
Don't worry.

03:41.350 --> 03:43.470
We're at 26 feet.

03:43.710 --> 03:45.430
You let Jason operate the drill?

03:45.630 --> 03:47.670
Yeah, he can handle it.

04:38.430 --> 04:40.550
I didn't do anything.

04:46.870 --> 04:50.110
Give me your hand!
Let go of the drill!

04:57.750 --> 05:00.510
Forget it, Jack! It's too late!

05:12.790 --> 05:14.030
You're not gonna make it!

05:25.190 --> 05:26.190
Jack!

05:36.990 --> 05:39.710
Jack! Give me your hand!

05:43.950 --> 05:45.950
I've got you!

05:48.670 --> 05:50.110
What were you thinking?

05:52.030 --> 05:56.470
- What's happening?
- The whole damn shelf is breaking off!

05:56.710 --> 05:58.790
That's what's happening!

06:16.610 --> 06:17.520
What we have found

06:17.620 --> 06:21.410
locked to these ice cores is evidence
of a cataclysmic climate shift

06:21.510 --> 06:23.600
that occurred around
10,000 years ago.

06:24.150 --> 06:28.030
The concentration of these natural
greenhouse gases in the ice cores

06:28.190 --> 06:31.550
indicates that runaway warming
pushed the planet into an ice age

06:31.710 --> 06:33.990
which lasted two centuries.

06:35.310 --> 06:37.190
I'm confused.

06:37.350 --> 06:41.500
I thought you were talking about
global warming, not an ice age.

06:41.600 --> 06:45.950
Yes, it is a paradox, but global
warming can trigger a cooling trend.

06:46.150 --> 06:47.150
Let me explain.

06:48.390 --> 06:50.800
The northern hemisphere
owes its temperate climate

06:50.900 --> 06:52.550
to the North Atlantic current.

06:53.310 --> 06:57.510
Heat from the sun arrives at the equator
and is carried north by the ocean.

06:57.750 --> 07:03.310
But, global warming is melting the polar
ice caps and disrupting this flow.

07:03.470 --> 07:07.030
Eventually it will shut down.
And when that occurs...

07:07.230 --> 07:09.110
there goes our warm climate.

07:09.270 --> 07:15.030
Excuse me. When do you think this
could happen, professor? When?

07:15.230 --> 07:17.970
I don't know. Maybe in 100 years,
maybe in 1000.

07:18.070 --> 07:20.880
But what I do know is that
if we do not act soon,

07:20.980 --> 07:24.590
it is our children and our grandchildren
who will have to pay the price.

07:26.350 --> 07:29.390
And who's going to pay the price
of the Kyoto Accord?

07:29.590 --> 07:33.430
It will cost the world's economy
hundreds of billions of dollars.

07:33.990 --> 07:36.050
With all due respect,
Mr. Vice President,

07:36.150 --> 07:39.040
the cost of doing nothing
could be even higher.

07:39.750 --> 07:41.550
Our climate is fragile.

07:41.750 --> 07:44.950
At the rate we're burning fossil fuels
and polluting the environment,

07:45.110 --> 07:47.350
the ice caps will soon disappear.

07:47.510 --> 07:50.870
Professor, um, Hall...

07:51.030 --> 07:54.070
our economy is every bit
as fragile as the environment.

07:54.270 --> 07:55.560
Perhaps you should
keep that in mind

07:55.660 --> 07:57.870
before making
sensationalist claims.

07:58.710 --> 08:02.220
Well, the last chunk of ice
that broke off

08:02.320 --> 08:04.350
was about the size of
the state of Rhode Island.

08:04.510 --> 08:07.310
Some people might call that
pretty sensational.

08:09.630 --> 08:12.910
<i>Stop global warming!
Stop global warming!</i>

08:13.630 --> 08:16.270
I'm here at the global warming
conference in New Delhi,

08:16.430 --> 08:18.360
where,
if you can believe your eyes,

08:18.460 --> 08:19.270
it's snowing.

08:19.370 --> 08:22.710
The coldest weather on record
has thrown the city into chaos,

08:22.910 --> 08:25.630
with hundreds of homeless people
freezing to death.

08:25.830 --> 08:26.830
Taxi!

08:27.470 --> 08:31.150
I enjoyed your testimony, professor.
It was very spirited.

08:31.310 --> 08:34.830
Oh, thank you. That's what we're
here for, right? Put on a good show?

08:34.990 --> 08:38.260
Quite. I was wondering
if I could talk to you

08:38.360 --> 08:40.850
about your theory on
abrupt climate shift.

08:41.070 --> 08:43.309
The name's Rapson.
Terry Rapson.

08:43.909 --> 08:44.960
Professor Rapson?

08:45.060 --> 08:46.780
- Of the Hedland Center?
- That's me.

08:46.880 --> 08:49.470
I've read your work on
ocean currents.

08:49.630 --> 08:54.310
- What do you say to a spot of tea?
- Absolutely. If we can hail a cab.

08:57.270 --> 08:58.950
Over here.

09:17.630 --> 09:20.800
<i>Welcome back to Glasgow, Scotland,
where Manchester United</i>

09:20.900 --> 09:23.460
<i>leads 3-1 over hometown Celtic.</i>

09:23.560 --> 09:25.740
<i>in this pitiful
Champions League match.</i>

09:25.870 --> 09:28.770
<i>We return to the action
63 minutes into the second half</i>

09:28.870 --> 09:31.760
<i>as Manchester United looks

09:31.860 --> 09:33.700
<i>Let's get back to our
commentator</i>

09:33.800 --> 09:35.630
<i>Donald MacFarland.</i>

09:36.870 --> 09:39.070
What? Yeah.

09:39.390 --> 09:42.190
- I just closed my eyes for a sec, man.
- Yeah.

09:42.350 --> 09:44.750
The baby kept us awake all night.

09:44.950 --> 09:45.900
<i>And still.</i>

09:46.000 --> 09:46.960
Good!

09:58.710 --> 09:59.610
Dennis?

09:59.710 --> 10:04.850
NOMAD buoy 4311 is showing
a temperature drop of 13 degrees.

10:04.950 --> 10:08.190
- Yeah? Where is 4311?
- Well, it's...

10:12.470 --> 10:15.230
- Georges Bank.
- It's rough seas out there.

10:15.430 --> 10:17.110
Must have knocked it about.

10:29.150 --> 10:31.790
Kick that bloody ball. Come on!

10:31.950 --> 10:34.430
Come on, kick it now. Kick it!

10:34.790 --> 10:36.430
- Kick it!
- Are the lads winning?

10:37.710 --> 10:40.390
Hello, professor.
How was India?

10:40.630 --> 10:43.150
Oh, you know what these
scientific gatherings are.

10:43.310 --> 10:46.270
All dancing girls,
wine and parties.

12:28.750 --> 12:32.510
<i>The fury of Hurricane Noelani
stunned weather experts yesterday</i>

12:32.670 --> 12:34.840
<i>slamming into

12:34.940 --> 12:37.810

<i>Meteorologists already believe

12:41.260 --> 12:42.260
<i>ever recorded.</i>

12:43.350 --> 12:44.830
Are you gonna get that?

12:47.310 --> 12:48.180
Hello?

12:48.280 --> 12:51.620
I just saw that Sam
got an F in calculus.

12:51.950 --> 12:55.230
I'm aware, Jack.
I get a copy of his report card too.

12:55.430 --> 12:58.510
Sam is a straight-A student.
He doesn't fail classes.

12:58.670 --> 13:00.750
All right, I don't have time
to talk about this right now.

13:00.910 --> 13:02.550
Well, maybe you ought to
make time.

13:03.950 --> 13:05.470
Excuse me, I'm not the one

13:05.570 --> 13:07.420
who's away for months
and months at a time.

13:08.150 --> 13:09.830
I just don't understand.

13:10.070 --> 13:11.620
I'll let him explain it to you.

13:11.720 --> 13:13.270
Can you take him
to the airport in the morning?

13:13.950 --> 13:15.080
Sam's getting on a plane?

13:15.180 --> 13:17.800
He joined the Scholastic
Decathlon Team.

13:17.900 --> 13:22.470
- They're competing in New York.
- Sam joined a team?

13:22.950 --> 13:25.310
- Yeah, I think there's a girl involved.
- Oh.

13:25.470 --> 13:27.230
Look, can you pick him up at 8:30?

13:27.590 --> 13:29.620
I gotta go because
I'm on call tonight.

13:29.720 --> 13:32.730
Jack, please don't be late.
I don't want him taking a taxi again.

13:32.830 --> 13:36.910
All right. Okay. I'll be there.
Okay? I'll be there.

13:40.470 --> 13:43.380
<i>This morning's weather staff meeting
has been moved to level four,</i>

13:43.480 --> 13:44.530
<i>conference room B.</i>

13:47.510 --> 13:48.510
Jack?

13:54.070 --> 13:55.520
I know you have an innate talent

13:55.620 --> 13:57.510
for rubbing people
the wrong way Jack, but why?

13:57.610 --> 13:58.570
Why, for the love of god,

13:58.670 --> 14:00.090
would you aggravate
the vice president?

14:00.270 --> 14:03.540
Because my 17-year-old kid
knows more science than he does.

14:03.640 --> 14:06.070
Perhaps. But your 17-year-old kid
does not control our budget.

14:06.230 --> 14:08.830
- It doesn't matter if he hates you.
- My son doesn't hate me.

14:08.990 --> 14:10.040
You're missing the point.

14:10.140 --> 14:11.180
What I'm trying to tell you is,

14:11.280 --> 14:12.560
- if Raymond Becker pulls our budget...
- Oh, shit!

14:12.660 --> 14:14.840
- Wait... Will you...?
Jack.

14:21.150 --> 14:23.350
Oh, my god.

14:29.350 --> 14:32.310
- Hi Sam. I'm sorry I'm late.
- Dad, it's fine. The cab's already here.

14:32.410 --> 14:34.190
That's okay. I'll take care of it.

14:34.350 --> 14:35.630
- What are you gonna...?
- Here you go.

14:38.150 --> 14:41.390
I'm not angry. I'm disappointed.

14:41.550 --> 14:44.790
- Do you want to hear my side of it?
- Sam, how can there be two sides?

14:44.950 --> 14:47.040
Hey look. I got every question
right on the final.

14:47.140 --> 14:48.860
And the only reason
why Mr. Spengler failed me

14:48.960 --> 14:50.540
was because I didn't write
out the solutions.

14:50.640 --> 14:51.640
Why not?

14:51.910 --> 14:54.110
I do them in my head.

14:54.270 --> 14:57.220
- Did you tell him that?
- I did. He didn't believe me.

14:57.320 --> 15:00.180
He said that if he can't do them
in his head, then I must be cheating.

15:00.510 --> 15:01.640
Oh, that's ridiculous.

15:01.740 --> 15:03.940
How can he fail you
for being smarter than he is?

15:04.040 --> 15:06.310
That's what I said.

15:06.750 --> 15:08.230
You did?

15:09.950 --> 15:12.470
- How'd he take it?
- He flunked me, remember?

15:13.790 --> 15:15.590
Oh, yeah.

15:18.390 --> 15:22.870
Sam, I'm sorry.
I jumped to conclusions.

15:23.550 --> 15:27.030
I'm gonna call this guy
and have a word with him.

15:27.230 --> 15:28.760
We're gonna get this
whole thing straighten out.

15:28.860 --> 15:30.390
Hey, you can't park there.

15:30.550 --> 15:32.830
- Don't worry about it.
- Sam?

15:33.310 --> 15:34.310
Sam.

15:49.070 --> 15:51.510
<i>Parker, this is Houston.</i>

15:51.670 --> 15:54.390
<i>We're seeing some bad weather
over Canaveral.</i>

15:54.590 --> 15:57.230
<i>It doesn't look like
you're coming back this week.</i>

15:57.390 --> 15:59.430
<i>Your wife's gonna give
me an earful.</i>

15:59.590 --> 16:01.230
Roger that.

16:01.430 --> 16:03.720
Hey, come take a look at
this storm system.

16:03.820 --> 16:04.820
It's enormous.

16:38.990 --> 16:40.750
You all right?

16:43.390 --> 16:45.310
He's afraid of flying.

16:45.470 --> 16:47.230
I'm fine.

16:55.270 --> 16:56.770
You know statistically,

16:56.870 --> 17:00.170
the chance of a plane going down
because of turbulence is less than,

17:00.270 --> 17:03.100
what, one in a billion?
Or is it a million?

17:04.750 --> 17:07.150
- I can't remember if it's a...
- Shut up, Brian.

17:07.349 --> 17:08.750
Listen, Sam...

17:08.910 --> 17:11.829
don't pay attention to him, okay?
Everything's fine.

17:11.990 --> 17:14.790
They're still serving drinks.

17:28.270 --> 17:31.440
<i>Hey folks, it appears we're gonna
have a little bit of a bumpy ride here</i>

17:31.540 --> 17:32.540
<i>for the next few minutes.</i>

17:33.370 --> 17:35.630
<i>Please fasten your seat belts
and put your tray tables</i>

17:35.790 --> 17:39.470
<i>and seatbacks in their upright positions
until we get through this. Thank you.</i>

17:42.550 --> 17:44.550
Grab it. Watch out!

18:15.510 --> 18:16.510
Sam?

18:18.230 --> 18:19.230
Sam.

18:23.230 --> 18:24.870
Can I have my hand back?

18:41.430 --> 18:43.670
I can't believe I'm spending
two weeks alone with my mom.

18:43.830 --> 18:45.070
Be patient with her.

18:45.170 --> 18:46.860
She's been looking forward to
this holiday for months.

18:47.230 --> 18:48.630
I know.

18:48.990 --> 18:50.950
I love you.

18:51.790 --> 18:53.070
I love you too.

18:55.150 --> 18:56.150
Hey.

18:56.950 --> 18:59.270
Hey, hello. Bye-bye.

18:59.430 --> 19:02.400
<i>The cause of this extreme
weather remains a mystery,</i>

19:02.500 --> 19:05.850
<i>although some meteorologists
believe sunspots are to blame.</i>

19:05.950 --> 19:06.920
<i>Hundreds are missing...</i>

19:07.020 --> 19:08.210
This is very odd.

19:08.310 --> 19:12.150
There's a buoy here registering
a 13-degree drop in ocean temperature.

19:12.250 --> 19:16.430
Oh, yeah, that's right.
That buoy malfunctioned the other day.

19:16.630 --> 19:17.540
I'll put a call in,

19:17.640 --> 19:19.610
see if there are any ships near
Georges Bank to get it.

19:19.710 --> 19:22.790
This buoy isn't in Georges Bank.
It's just off Greenland.

19:22.950 --> 19:23.950
What?

19:27.150 --> 19:29.180
What are the odds of
two buoys failing?

19:29.280 --> 19:30.280
Remote.

19:36.790 --> 19:38.590
Make that three.

19:49.230 --> 19:51.760
Just another typical day
in New York City.

19:51.860 --> 19:54.340
Traffic jam, 10 blocks long.

19:54.510 --> 19:55.650
Lookie here, Buddha.

19:55.950 --> 20:00.020
These people, and their cars,
and their exhaust

20:00.120 --> 20:01.950
and they're just polluting
the atmosphere.

20:02.150 --> 20:05.750
Excuse me, sir. We're really late.

20:06.030 --> 20:08.150
We're almost there.

20:08.310 --> 20:12.470
- We're only two blocks away.
- Let's walk.

20:39.070 --> 20:40.750
What's gotten into them?

20:40.910 --> 20:45.430
I have no idea.
They're all worked up today.

20:46.630 --> 20:51.790
In 1532, Spanish conquistador
Francisco Pizarro

20:51.990 --> 20:57.650
defeated this Incan emperor at the
Peruvian highland town of Cajamarca.

20:57.910 --> 21:00.850
What is his name?
Time.

21:01.750 --> 21:03.190
Montezuma.

21:03.390 --> 21:06.110
No, no, Montezuma was in Mexico,
not Peru.

21:06.270 --> 21:09.230
It's, like, Anta-something.

21:11.150 --> 21:13.070
- Atahualpa?
- That's it!

21:13.230 --> 21:15.230
Time's up. Correct answers, please.

21:18.150 --> 21:23.830
That's five points for Woodmont
and five points for Pinehurst Academy.

21:24.910 --> 21:26.390
Next question.

21:28.110 --> 21:34.190
In what year did Louis Quatorze
ascend to the throne of France?

21:38.470 --> 21:40.550
This place is so retro,

21:40.650 --> 21:43.100
it might actually be cool
if it were on purpose.

21:45.830 --> 21:48.150
Yeah, look at all these nerds.

21:48.310 --> 21:49.310
Hey.

21:50.870 --> 21:51.870
Hey.

21:54.030 --> 21:56.070
You look beautiful.

21:56.790 --> 21:58.950
Thanks. This place is incredible.

21:59.110 --> 22:01.110
Do you believe that
this is their cafeteria?

22:01.310 --> 22:03.070
You played a great first round.

22:03.510 --> 22:05.230
So did you.

22:05.390 --> 22:08.150
These are my teammates,
Sam and Brian.

22:08.310 --> 22:10.390
- I'm Laura.
- Oh, I'm J.D.

22:10.550 --> 22:13.470
- Your school's amazing.
- Would you like... would you like a tour?

22:16.990 --> 22:19.590
Sure. That'd be great.

22:19.790 --> 22:21.750
Could you hold this for a sec?

22:22.470 --> 22:24.630
Yeah, sure.

22:24.910 --> 22:26.310
Thanks.

22:32.390 --> 22:34.790
Man, you got some
serious competition.

22:35.350 --> 22:36.750
Please.

22:37.470 --> 22:41.110
- I bet he's really rich too.
- Shut up.

22:53.430 --> 22:54.430
Who is it?

22:54.900 --> 22:56.200
<i>Terry Rapson here.</i>

22:56.950 --> 22:58.390
<i>Sorry to call you so early.</i>

22:58.550 --> 23:00.670
No, professor, it's all right.
What is it?

23:01.590 --> 23:04.060
Well, we've found something
extraordinary.

23:04.160 --> 23:06.540
Extraordinary and disturbing, that is.

23:06.750 --> 23:08.670
You recall what you said
in New Delhi

23:08.770 --> 23:12.290
about how polar melting might
disrupt the North Atlantic Current?

23:12.390 --> 23:13.390
Yes.

23:14.630 --> 23:16.030
Well...

23:17.070 --> 23:18.670
I think it's happening.

23:22.110 --> 23:23.390
What do you mean?

23:23.550 --> 23:27.590
<i>One of our NOMAD buoys
registered a 13-degree drop</i>

23:27.750 --> 23:29.160
<i>in surface temperature
the other day.</i>

23:29.260 --> 23:30.710
<i>I've sent you an e-mail.</i>

23:30.870 --> 23:32.470
Hold on.

23:34.070 --> 23:36.470
<i>At first we thought
it was a malfunction.</i>

23:36.630 --> 23:39.140
<i>But there are four more
across the North Atlantic</i>

23:39.240 --> 23:40.390
<i> showing the same thing.</i>

23:40.910 --> 23:43.070
This is unbelievable.

23:43.830 --> 23:45.510
You predicted it would happen.

23:45.670 --> 23:49.350
Yes, but not in our lifetime.
This is too fast.

23:49.550 --> 23:50.410
<i>There are no</i>

23:50.510 --> 23:54.870
forecast models remotely capable
of plotting this scenario,

23:55.450 --> 23:56.510
<i>except yours.</i>

23:56.670 --> 24:00.030
My model is a reconstruction
of a prehistoric climate shift.

24:00.130 --> 24:02.070
It's not a forecast model.

24:02.230 --> 24:04.510
<i>It's the closest thing we have.</i>

24:05.590 --> 24:08.350
Nothing like this has ever
happened before.

24:08.710 --> 24:11.710
At least not in the last
10,000 years.

24:37.670 --> 24:39.590
<i>As I predicted yesterday,</i>

24:39.990 --> 24:43.590
the swell off Hurricane
Noelani is incredible.

24:43.750 --> 24:48.110
<i>These waves are even bigger
than I imagined. Just take a look.</i>

24:49.630 --> 24:51.540
Shouldn't you be monitoring
the weather or something?

24:51.640 --> 24:53.290
This is L.A. What weather?

24:56.390 --> 24:59.070
Wait. What's that noise?

24:59.230 --> 25:01.110
What noise?

25:12.170 --> 25:14.390
Honey, I'll be right back.

25:16.230 --> 25:18.100
<i>The Coast Guard has
closed the beaches,</i>

25:18.200 --> 25:20.090
<i>as waves have grown too big for...</i>

25:21.290 --> 25:22.220
L.A. Weather Center.

25:22.320 --> 25:23.610
<i>It's Tommy.
I'm down at the beach.</i>

25:23.710 --> 25:25.270
I'm in the middle of something,
Tommy. What do you need?

25:27.910 --> 25:31.180
There's hail the size of golf balls
coming down here.

25:31.280 --> 25:33.980
<i>A low-pressure system moving
along the California coastline</i>

25:34.080 --> 25:36.590
<i>is creating a cyclonic system
across the L.A. Basin.</i>

25:44.150 --> 25:45.090
<i>Yeah? Hello?</i>

25:45.190 --> 25:46.780
Hey boss, turn on The Weather
Channel right away.

25:46.880 --> 25:48.490
<i>I think we have to issue
a tornado warning.</i>

25:48.590 --> 25:49.990
What are you talking about?

25:51.310 --> 25:54.390
<i>Palmdale and Lancaster are reporting
wind speeds in excess of 70 miles...</i>

25:54.550 --> 25:55.510
Hold on a second.

25:55.610 --> 25:58.030
<i>...conditions that are highly
unusual for California.</i>

26:17.910 --> 26:20.510
Tom, we're building a forecast model,
we're gonna need... what?

26:20.670 --> 26:23.910
Priority access to the mainframe
for two days, maybe three.

26:24.070 --> 26:26.950
- Oh, is that it? Anything else?
- We need it immediately.

26:27.110 --> 26:29.150
You know I would say that
you've lost your mind

26:29.310 --> 26:31.460
but you've been this way
for the past 20 years.

26:31.560 --> 26:33.960
Tom, this is important.

26:34.060 --> 26:35.530
What's this forecast model
you're building,

26:35.630 --> 26:36.780
if you don't mind my asking?

26:36.950 --> 26:38.920
Janet Tokada, this is Jack Hall.

26:39.020 --> 26:41.540
Janet's a hurricane specialist
with NASA.

26:41.750 --> 26:43.340
Jack's a paleoclimatologist,

26:43.440 --> 26:45.390
and I have absolutely no idea
what he's up to.

26:46.830 --> 26:49.510
Booker. What's going on here?

26:49.670 --> 26:52.550
They just issued a tornado warning
in Los Angeles.

26:52.710 --> 26:55.750
<i>Breaking news as we prepare
to go live to Los Angeles.</i>

26:55.910 --> 26:57.390
<i>- Mixed reports are coming in about...
- Report is just coming out.</i>

26:57.490 --> 26:59.540
<i>some extreme weather
occurring in the area.</i>

27:00.070 --> 27:03.670
<i>Okay, we're now going live
to our Fox affiliate in Los Angeles.</i>

27:07.350 --> 27:10.510
<i>We have live coverage now
from our Fox 11 chopper.</i>

27:10.610 --> 27:11.770
<i>Are you there, Bart?</i>

27:11.870 --> 27:15.060
Uh, yes, I'm here. These tornados
are forming so fast...

27:15.160 --> 27:18.350
- Bart!
- What? Oh! Oh, my god.

27:18.510 --> 27:21.050
Lisa, are you getting this on camera?

27:21.150 --> 27:23.790
This tornado just came and
erased the Hollywood sign.

27:23.890 --> 27:27.070
<i>The Hollywood sign is gone.
It's just shredded.</i>

27:38.870 --> 27:41.320
<i>Bart, what can you see?
Is anyone hurt?</i>

27:41.420 --> 27:44.120
<i>I wouldn't be surprised.
There is so much damage down there.</i>

27:44.220 --> 27:46.990
And there are people down there,
taking pictures.

27:47.150 --> 27:48.940
Hey, what the hell
are you guys doing?

27:49.040 --> 27:50.250
Go for cover!

27:50.350 --> 27:52.830
You can't stay here!
Get out of here!

27:55.390 --> 27:58.200
What you're seeing are
two actual tornados

27:58.300 --> 28:00.500
striking Los Angeles
International Airport.

28:00.600 --> 28:01.520
Wait. Wait.

28:01.620 --> 28:03.930
It looks like they've joined
and formed one large tornado.

28:04.030 --> 28:05.630
- Tommy!
- Oh, my god!

28:06.830 --> 28:08.830
Holy shit!

28:09.670 --> 28:12.370
<i>I'd like to urge all of our viewers
to stay away from the areas...</i>

28:12.470 --> 28:15.980
- Jeff, where are you?
- I'm on Yucca and Vine.

28:16.080 --> 28:19.110
- I'm on my way there now.
- You're on TV. Right in the middle of it.

28:19.310 --> 28:22.510
God! Oh, my god!

28:28.990 --> 28:30.950
You gotta get out of there, man.

28:35.430 --> 28:37.950
<i>That bus just got dropped
on top of that Porsche!</i>

28:38.150 --> 28:40.390
<i>Oh, my god.
I hope no one was in that car.</i>

28:40.550 --> 28:43.170
<i>For our national audience
just joining us now</i>

28:43.270 --> 28:46.090
<i>we are going live to downtown
Los Angeles right now.</i>

28:46.190 --> 28:46.930
Tommy?

28:47.030 --> 28:49.870
<i>If you look over there behind me,
that's a tornado.</i>

28:50.030 --> 28:52.510
Yes, a twister in Los Angeles.

28:52.670 --> 28:56.790
It's one of many tornados
that are destroying our city.

28:56.950 --> 29:00.230
There's another one.
That's the Los Angeles skyline.

29:00.390 --> 29:04.070
<i>It's unbelievable! It's huge!
I've never seen anything like it.</i>

29:16.670 --> 29:17.910
What's happening?

29:18.070 --> 29:20.790
It- it- it looks like some sort of

29:20.910 --> 29:26.190
huge, horrific, terrifying nightmare,
only this is the real thing...

30:35.150 --> 30:37.350
Yes, I'm looking at it right now.

30:37.990 --> 30:39.770
- Yes, it is.
- What's happening Raymond?

30:39.870 --> 30:41.270
I'll call you back.

30:42.270 --> 30:46.430
Mr. President, Los Angeles has been
devastated by a series of tornados.

30:48.390 --> 30:52.110
On top of that, the FAA wants your
approval to suspend all air traffic.

30:52.310 --> 30:53.280
What do you think we should do?

30:53.380 --> 30:55.380
Until we can figure it out
what's going on here I...

30:55.480 --> 30:57.510
I don't think we have
much choice, sir.

30:57.610 --> 31:01.590
<i>What you're seeing is what's left
of downtown Los Angeles.</i>

31:01.750 --> 31:04.310
Hey, man, I just got off
the phone with my mom.

31:04.510 --> 31:08.430
Excuse me, you guys. I'm really sorry,
but we need to change the channel.

31:08.830 --> 31:12.810
<i>The FAA has grounded
all air traffic in the United States.</i>

31:12.970 --> 31:16.300
<i>Unfortunately, the order came
too late for two planes</i>

31:16.400 --> 31:19.510
<i>that were brought down by
severe turbulence in the Midwest.</i>

31:19.670 --> 31:22.670
- The first flight...
- So much for "one in a billion."

31:26.190 --> 31:28.440
All right.
All right, listen up, everybody.

31:28.540 --> 31:29.660
Listen up, please.

31:29.760 --> 31:32.790
We've got a lot of work to do,
and we don't have much time

31:32.890 --> 31:35.370
so let's get started, please.
Vorsteen?

31:37.030 --> 31:38.750
All our grid models are worthless.

31:38.910 --> 31:41.870
I don't think grid models
are gonna be a lot of help here.

31:42.190 --> 31:44.400
The Canadians are reporting
tremendous circulation

31:44.500 --> 31:45.610
moving down from the Arctic.

31:45.710 --> 31:48.830
In Siberia, there's a low-pressure
system unlike anything we've seen,

31:49.030 --> 31:52.190
and Australia just saw the strongest
typhoon ever recorded.

31:52.290 --> 31:54.650
Hang on. Are you saying that
these things are interconnected?

31:54.750 --> 31:56.010
We have to consider the possibility.

31:56.110 --> 31:59.910
The only force strong enough to
affect global weather is the sun.

32:00.350 --> 32:02.940
- What's NASA have to say?
- We've already checked.

32:03.040 --> 32:04.670
Solar output is normal.

32:04.910 --> 32:06.700
What about the
North Atlantic Current?

32:07.600 --> 32:08.600
What about it?

32:10.070 --> 32:11.670
I got a call last night...

32:11.770 --> 32:14.150
from Professor Rapson
at the Hedland Center.

32:14.430 --> 32:16.790
He thinks the current has changed.

32:18.190 --> 32:20.150
Oh, come on, Jack.
How could that be?

32:20.710 --> 32:23.670
The current depends upon a delicate
balance of salt and freshwater.

32:23.870 --> 32:26.430
- We all know that.
- Yes.

32:26.590 --> 32:28.310
But no one has taken into account

32:28.410 --> 32:30.840
how much freshwater has been
dumped into the ocean

32:30.940 --> 32:32.590
because of melting polar ice.

32:33.430 --> 32:36.430
I think we've hit a critical
desalinization point.

32:39.310 --> 32:41.990
It would explain what's driving
this extreme weather.

32:42.150 --> 32:44.950
Hedland had some
pretty convincing data.

32:45.110 --> 32:47.760
They've asked me to feed it into
my paleoclimate model

32:47.860 --> 32:49.420
to track the next set of events.

32:49.520 --> 32:50.250
Hold on Jack.

32:50.350 --> 32:52.420
Are you suggesting these weather
anomalies are gonna continue?

32:53.270 --> 32:55.910
Not just continue. Get worse.

33:00.030 --> 33:03.010
I think we're on the verge
of a major climate shift.

33:08.990 --> 33:11.590
Tom. What are you gonna tell
the Administration?

33:11.690 --> 33:12.780
What do you expect me
to tell them?

33:12.880 --> 33:15.480
The government has to start making
long term preparations, now.

33:15.580 --> 33:16.840
Jack, all you have is a theory.

33:16.940 --> 33:18.740
Well, then give me the mainframe.
And let me prove it.

33:18.840 --> 33:19.840
No.

33:23.510 --> 33:25.430
You have 48 hours.

33:26.470 --> 33:27.990
- Professor Hall.
- Yes.

33:28.150 --> 33:31.070
- I think your theory may be correct.
- Walk with me.

33:31.230 --> 33:34.710
Just a few weeks ago, I monitored
the strongest hurricane on record.

33:34.870 --> 33:37.590
The hail, the tornados, it all fits.

33:37.750 --> 33:40.200
Can the model you're working on
factoring in storm scenarios?

33:40.300 --> 33:43.790
- We haven't had the time.
- Well, maybe I can help.

33:43.950 --> 33:45.630
- Welcome aboard.
- Thanks.

33:45.790 --> 33:47.790
Hi, I'm Jason.

33:47.990 --> 33:48.990
Hi.

33:52.270 --> 33:54.170
Do you have the results of
Peter's CT scan?

33:54.270 --> 33:56.870
Yeah. The treatments
shrunk the tumor 20 percent.

33:57.070 --> 33:59.830
- Is his eyesight better today?
- No. No change.

34:09.949 --> 34:13.670
- Hi, Peter. How are you doing today?
- A little better.

34:13.830 --> 34:14.830
Good.

34:16.110 --> 34:18.190
Let me listen here.

34:19.550 --> 34:20.790
Can you read that?

34:21.030 --> 34:25.310
No, but I remember the story
from the pictures.

34:25.710 --> 34:26.989
You do?

34:27.270 --> 34:29.310
My mother used to read it to me.

34:29.790 --> 34:33.790
She must be very proud of you.
You've been such a brave, big boy.

34:34.590 --> 34:37.510
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

34:38.230 --> 34:41.070
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

34:45.550 --> 34:48.989
Jack, you've been working
for 24 hours straight.

34:49.150 --> 34:51.870
You're the only one
who hasn't taken a break.

34:53.190 --> 34:55.830
Maybe I'll try to shut
my eyes for a while.

34:56.070 --> 34:58.150
Call me when you get the results.

35:02.510 --> 35:04.780
Frank, is he always so obsessive?

35:04.880 --> 35:06.710
- Yeah.
- Yes.

35:08.830 --> 35:10.190
Does he ever lighten up?

35:10.430 --> 35:12.030
- Not really.
- No.

35:15.590 --> 35:17.090
How long have you been
working together?

35:17.790 --> 35:21.070
Well, Frank's been working with
him since the Stone Age,

35:21.170 --> 35:25.550
but I've only had to endure
two years of servitude.

35:33.270 --> 35:34.270
Jack.

35:34.950 --> 35:36.990
Jack, we got the results.

35:45.430 --> 35:47.750
Six to eight months?
That can't be.

35:48.710 --> 35:51.550
That time scale isn't in months.
It's in weeks.

35:55.590 --> 35:57.750
<i>Widespread flooding has
slowed transportation</i>

35:57.850 --> 35:59.070
<i>and caused numerous closures,</i>

35:59.170 --> 36:01.030
<i>including the Lincoln and
Holland Tunnels.</i>

36:01.270 --> 36:03.130
The plumbing in the school
is really old.

36:03.230 --> 36:05.980
And I guess seeing with all this rain,
the sewage got stopped up.

36:06.150 --> 36:07.580
Where are you staying tonight?

36:07.680 --> 36:10.310
<i>They're finding a place for us to stay
with kids here in New York City.</i>

36:10.470 --> 36:13.110
Are you sure you can't get home
any sooner than tomorrow?

36:13.350 --> 36:17.110
Well, look, dad, I would if I could,
you know. I just...

36:18.830 --> 36:21.150
This smell is unbearable, dad.

36:21.310 --> 36:23.500
Stop kidding around!
I want you home.

36:23.600 --> 36:25.150
<i>Dad, I'll be on the train.</i>

36:25.310 --> 36:27.570
Do me a favor okay.
Just don't worry about me.

36:27.670 --> 36:28.820
I'll figure it out.

36:29.430 --> 36:32.670
All right, son.
I'll see you tomorrow.

36:35.470 --> 36:37.790
Hey, Sam, guess what?

36:37.990 --> 36:40.150
We got a place to stay.

36:41.190 --> 36:42.390
Great.

36:42.670 --> 36:45.440
<i>So far, the terrible weather
hasn't hit D.C. area,</i>

36:45.540 --> 36:48.030
<i>but local residents aren't
taking any chances</i>

36:48.190 --> 36:50.960
<i>as people stock up for
what is already being billed</i>

36:51.060 --> 36:53.280
<i>as the worst storm
season on record.</i>

36:53.380 --> 36:54.470
You better be sure about this Jack.

36:54.570 --> 36:56.790
- My ass is on the line.
- You saw the model.

36:56.950 --> 36:59.310
And I hope to god it's wrong.

36:59.750 --> 37:01.430
- Mr. Vice President.
- Tom.

37:01.630 --> 37:04.270
- You know Professor Hall.
- Yes, we've met.

37:04.430 --> 37:06.610
Professor Hall has some
new information

37:06.710 --> 37:07.810
I think you should
take a look at it.

37:07.910 --> 37:10.670
We just got these results
from our simulation model.

37:10.870 --> 37:12.800
They explain what's causing
this severe weather.

37:12.900 --> 37:14.230
Look, I have to read this later.

37:14.330 --> 37:16.320
I have a meeting with the
director of FEMA right now.

37:16.420 --> 37:17.630
This is very urgent sir.

37:17.730 --> 37:19.540
Our climate is changing violently.

37:19.640 --> 37:21.990
And it's going to happen over
the next six to eight weeks.

37:22.230 --> 37:24.790
I bet you said this wouldn't happen
for another 100 years or so.

37:24.950 --> 37:27.630
- I was wrong.
- Well, suppose you're wrong this time.

37:27.790 --> 37:28.760
I wish that I were,

37:28.860 --> 37:31.090
but I'm sure that you're aware of
what's happening all around the world.

37:31.190 --> 37:34.160
We're making all the necessary
preparations for this storm.

37:34.260 --> 37:35.470
What more do you expect?

37:35.570 --> 37:39.510
You have to start thinking about
large-scale evacuations right now.

37:39.750 --> 37:41.430
Especially in the Northern states.

37:41.590 --> 37:43.150
- Evacuations?
- Yes.

37:43.350 --> 37:46.830
Have you lost your mind, Hall?
I have to go.

37:47.910 --> 37:49.610
Mr. Vice President!

37:49.710 --> 37:51.990
If we don't act now,
it's going to be too late.

37:56.070 --> 37:58.030
Come on, Jack.

37:58.430 --> 38:00.030
Hey. Thanks for bringing us here.

38:00.230 --> 38:01.520
I couldn't let you leave New York

38:01.620 --> 38:03.740
without seeing the
Natural History Museum.

38:04.270 --> 38:05.040
Of course not.

38:05.140 --> 38:07.280
It's the world's finest
collection of stuffed animals.

38:07.380 --> 38:08.590
Hey, guys, check this out.

38:09.030 --> 38:11.100
"The body of this mammoth
was found

38:11.200 --> 38:14.050
perfectly preserved
in the Siberian tundra

38:14.430 --> 38:18.390
with food still in its mouth
and stomach

38:18.790 --> 38:23.750
indicating that it froze
instantly while grazing."

38:28.790 --> 38:32.140
<i>It's been 24 hours now since
the snow started falling</i>

38:32.240 --> 38:34.310
<i>across the British Isles
and over Northern Europe.</i>

38:34.410 --> 38:36.190
<i>It shows no signs of letting up.</i>

38:36.390 --> 38:39.150
No, no, no. You've got to
stop worrying. No, no.

38:39.350 --> 38:43.070
It's fine. We've got plenty of
supplies. We're just snowed in.

38:43.510 --> 38:45.910
Yeah. No, it's all right.
It's all right.

38:46.070 --> 38:48.110
No, you stay where you are.
I'll be fine.

38:48.430 --> 38:51.190
Yeah, I love you too.
Okay, bye.

38:52.510 --> 38:56.470
- Hey. How's Jeanette?
- Oh, fine.

38:56.630 --> 38:58.590
The ferry just landed.

38:58.750 --> 39:00.540
Must be nice in Spain.
Wish I was there.

39:00.640 --> 39:04.430
<i>An elite RAF search-and-rescue team
has been deployed by helicopter</i>

39:04.630 --> 39:07.270
<i>to airlift the royal family to safety.</i>

39:07.670 --> 39:09.590
Yeah, you think they'll come get us
since we got snowed in?

39:09.690 --> 39:10.690
Not likely.

39:12.070 --> 39:13.720
Luckily we've got our
own genny,

39:14.190 --> 39:15.920
enough tea and biscuits
to sink a ship.

39:16.670 --> 39:18.630
Oh, we'll be fine.

39:18.790 --> 39:21.270
As long as the loo
doesn't back up again.

39:41.550 --> 39:43.660
<i>We've got zero visibility.</i>

39:43.760 --> 39:45.640
- Maintain heading and speed.
- What's our heading?

39:45.740 --> 39:47.110
035, sir.

39:47.270 --> 39:50.190
Approximately 40 kilometers
from Balmoral Castle.

39:50.350 --> 39:52.990
<i>We've lost visual contact with you.</i>

40:16.830 --> 40:19.870
<i>- This gauge here can't be right.
- Wind speed has dropped to zero.</i>

40:20.070 --> 40:23.030
<i>We have vertical walls
of cirrus cloud formations.</i>

40:23.390 --> 40:24.680
What the hell is going on?

40:24.880 --> 40:26.880
The bloody fuel lines
are starting to freeze.

40:38.150 --> 40:41.480
Port engine pressure is dropping.
The rotor rpm is dropping.

40:41.670 --> 40:45.190
We've got a flameout on
the starboard side as well.

40:48.710 --> 40:50.790
Prepare for crash landing.

40:52.350 --> 40:54.830
Select emergency fuel.

40:55.390 --> 40:57.550
Come on, you bastard!

40:58.110 --> 40:59.710
Come on!

41:23.230 --> 41:26.030
What I'm about to tell you
is supposed to be confidential.

41:26.190 --> 41:29.910
Several hours ago, three helicopters
went down over Scotland.

41:30.110 --> 41:33.550
They crashed because the fuel
in their lines froze.

41:34.430 --> 41:38.590
<i>- At what temperature does...?
- Negative 150 degrees Fahrenheit.</i>

41:38.790 --> 41:40.110
<i>We had to look it up.</i>

41:40.270 --> 41:42.750
The temperature dropped
phenomenally fast.

41:42.990 --> 41:46.630
On the ground, people froze before
they could get out of their cars even.

41:46.830 --> 41:49.440
Can you get me a satellite picture
of Scotland two hours ago?

41:49.540 --> 41:50.350
Yeah.

41:50.450 --> 41:52.110
We've got mountains of data

41:52.270 --> 41:55.120
but nowhere near enough
computer power to analyze it.

41:55.220 --> 41:56.220
Can you help us?

41:56.430 --> 41:58.390
Send us what you got.
We'll do our best.

41:58.630 --> 42:01.590
<i>Thanks, Jack. Bye for now.</i>

42:02.590 --> 42:06.070
This is Scotland at the time
the temperature dropped.

42:08.510 --> 42:10.790
This thing looks just like a hurricane.

42:10.990 --> 42:13.950
Only hurricanes don't form over land.

42:21.430 --> 42:23.830
- Good evening, sir.
- Hey, Harold.

42:24.030 --> 42:26.750
- Thanks, Victor. See you in the morning.
- Right, sir.

42:26.950 --> 42:28.870
- Terrible weather.
- Tell me about it.

42:33.430 --> 42:34.430
Wow.

42:36.750 --> 42:38.230
You live here?

42:38.390 --> 42:40.130
Just on the weekends.
It's...

42:40.390 --> 42:43.110
It's my dad's place.
He's kind of never around, so...

42:43.270 --> 42:44.670
Where is he?

42:44.830 --> 42:47.990
Skiing in Europe with my stepmom.

42:50.790 --> 42:52.510
Is this you and your brother?

42:52.710 --> 42:55.830
Yeah, that's when we took
a bike trip together.

43:00.070 --> 43:03.350
It's been raining like this
for three days now.

43:13.910 --> 43:16.350
Come on, hurry up.

43:30.190 --> 43:31.550
I'm just standing here.

43:32.310 --> 43:33.550
You can't stay here.

43:33.990 --> 43:35.990
I never liked this neighborhood anyway.

43:36.190 --> 43:38.710
<i>It's a mob scene here
at Grand Central Station.</i>

43:38.910 --> 43:40.840
<i>Over half the platforms
are flooded</i>

43:40.940 --> 43:44.200
<i>and service has been
suspended on all trains.</i>

43:44.300 --> 43:47.390
<i>With planes still grounded
and trains now out of service</i>

43:47.550 --> 43:49.270
<i>that's bad news for the...</i>

43:49.430 --> 43:50.400
Hey, Victor's coming to pick me up.

43:50.500 --> 43:51.930
You guys want a ride
to the train station?

43:53.750 --> 43:54.990
Not anymore.

43:55.150 --> 44:00.590
<i>In Nova Scotia earlier today the ocean
rose by 25 feet in a matter of seconds.</i>

44:00.750 --> 44:04.350
<i>What we have feared for the past
few days has indeed happened.</i>

44:04.550 --> 44:06.630
<i>The cold front moving down
from the Arctic</i>

44:06.790 --> 44:09.470
<i>has created an enormous
storm system in Canada.</i>

44:09.630 --> 44:11.060
<i>Which, incredible as it sounds,</i>

44:11.160 --> 44:13.510
<i>looks more and more like
a tropical hurricane...</i>

44:13.630 --> 44:15.670
Well, I gotta go pick up
my little brother.

44:15.770 --> 44:17.050
Do you guys want me to
give you a ride?

44:17.150 --> 44:18.180
Where is he?

44:18.280 --> 44:20.030
He's in a boarding school
in Philadelphia.

44:20.550 --> 44:22.070
<i>If this system moves south</i>

44:22.230 --> 44:24.390
<i>we could see a wind-driven
storm surge</i>

44:24.490 --> 44:26.840
<i>that could threaten
the entire Eastern Seaboard.</i>

44:28.750 --> 44:30.030
Okay, bye.

44:30.190 --> 44:32.710
Victor's stuck in traffic
over on Fifth Avenue.

44:32.910 --> 44:35.420
It'll be easier to head straight out of
town if we just meet him over there.

44:35.520 --> 44:36.280
All right.

44:36.380 --> 44:39.070
You mean walk?
No, not in this.

44:42.950 --> 44:44.710
We should take the stairs.

44:44.870 --> 44:47.510
We're on the top floor.

44:50.510 --> 44:52.110
I guess we're walking.

45:05.270 --> 45:07.150
Maybe we should just stay here.

45:07.350 --> 45:08.950
I think the young lady is right sir.

45:09.350 --> 45:11.790
No. We need to get home.

45:36.470 --> 45:38.430
Hey, Cesar, come here.

45:39.030 --> 45:40.670
What are you doing?

45:45.750 --> 45:48.470
The wolves, they're gone.

45:48.630 --> 45:50.830
<i>Just to give you an idea
of the situation</i>

45:51.030 --> 45:54.150
<i>which seems to be becoming
worse with each passing minute.</i>

45:54.310 --> 45:57.870
<i>At the moment, we have flooding
in most parts of the island.</i>

45:58.070 --> 46:01.440
<i>We've got traffic snarl-ups
because the electricity is now out</i>

46:01.540 --> 46:05.110
<i>to almost every part of Manhattan.
No traffic signals.</i>

46:05.270 --> 46:07.630
<i>Car accidents, at least two hundred.</i>

46:07.790 --> 46:09.490
<i>And lower Manhattan,
we've been told,</i>

46:09.590 --> 46:12.190
<i>is virtually inaccessible.</i>

46:33.230 --> 46:35.710
Can you call Mom?
Will you please phone her for me?

46:35.950 --> 46:36.950
Hey.

46:38.350 --> 46:39.790
That dog can't come in here.

46:39.950 --> 46:42.430
Come on, man.
It's pouring out there.

46:42.590 --> 46:44.830
I don't care. Read the sign.

46:46.790 --> 46:49.590
It's supposed to be a public library.

46:55.830 --> 46:57.870
Come on, guys, this way.

46:58.470 --> 47:00.150
Excuse me. You're bad.

47:00.350 --> 47:03.550
Goddamn 1500-dollar
waterproof raincoat.

47:03.710 --> 47:06.590
- Please, shut up, man.
- There must be rats everywhere.

47:06.790 --> 47:08.270
That's because it's New York.

47:08.470 --> 47:10.270
Hey! Hey!

47:11.470 --> 47:14.110
- Open up, big papa.
- It's out of service.

47:14.670 --> 47:16.390
It's out of service.

47:16.550 --> 47:18.820
No, no. I'll give you 100 dollars
to put it in service.

47:18.920 --> 47:19.730
You don't have to do that.

47:19.830 --> 47:22.270
No, no, really. 200 dollars.
I won't have it. I won't have it.

47:22.430 --> 47:24.340
Oh god, I love buses.
This is so much fun.

47:24.440 --> 47:25.890
This is gonna be the bomb.

47:26.510 --> 47:27.710
Hello?

47:28.150 --> 47:29.680
I can't reach my driver.

47:29.780 --> 47:30.990
- I lost the signal.
- This is insane.

47:31.090 --> 47:32.660
We're not gonna be able to
drive anywhere.

47:32.760 --> 47:33.920
We should just go back to
your apartment.

47:34.020 --> 47:35.030
Yeah, I vote for that.

47:35.130 --> 47:37.280
What? Are you kidding?
We have to get higher!

47:37.670 --> 47:39.070
Come on.

47:39.230 --> 47:41.470
Up to the library.

47:41.630 --> 47:43.630
Calm down.

47:44.430 --> 47:46.350
I can't understand what you're saying.

47:48.430 --> 47:51.350
If you stay calm, ma'am,
I'll get you out.

47:56.590 --> 47:58.950
The door is jammed!

47:59.990 --> 48:01.310
I don't speak French!

48:36.870 --> 48:38.190
Hey, where's Laura?

48:40.230 --> 48:44.350
- She was just right there.
- She's right there! Right there, see?

48:44.550 --> 48:46.030
What is she doing?

48:46.190 --> 48:47.840
Tell them to cover their eyes.

49:12.230 --> 49:15.190
<i>There is a wall of water
coming towards New York City.</i>

49:15.290 --> 49:16.290
<i>Everybody...</i>

50:00.260 --> 50:01.810
What? What's the problem?

50:01.910 --> 50:03.750
She left her bag in the cab.
Their passports.

50:03.950 --> 50:05.990
Forget about it.

50:06.150 --> 50:08.310
- I'll get it for her.
- Come on.

50:14.910 --> 50:16.150
Oh, my...

50:22.310 --> 50:23.510
Laura!

50:29.150 --> 50:30.350
Laura!

50:31.830 --> 50:33.750
- Sam.
- No! Brian, no!

50:33.910 --> 50:36.150
Laura! Laura, look!

50:36.310 --> 50:37.950
Come on. Come!

50:38.750 --> 50:40.350
Come on!

50:42.830 --> 50:43.830
Sam!

50:44.530 --> 50:45.530
No!

51:24.190 --> 51:25.750
Professor.

51:26.790 --> 51:28.150
Thank you.

51:29.590 --> 51:32.910
- Is that Neville's handiwork?
- Neville's way beyond stick figures.

51:33.070 --> 51:34.870
- He's 6 already.
- Oh.

51:35.030 --> 51:37.990
No, this masterpiece belongs
to my second grandson, David.

51:38.190 --> 51:41.350
God. I can't believe
Neville's 6 already.

51:45.190 --> 51:47.150
You won't believe
how fast they grow.

51:49.470 --> 51:51.310
Professor.
I've got Jack Hall on the phone.

51:51.670 --> 51:53.870
They've run the data
we've sent them.

51:55.390 --> 51:56.950
Here he is.

51:59.830 --> 52:03.270
Jack, were you able to recreate
the thermal cycle?

52:03.470 --> 52:06.440
Yes. The storm's rotation is
pulling super-cooled air

52:06.540 --> 52:09.630
all the way down
from the upper troposphere.

52:11.670 --> 52:15.530
But shouldn't the air warm up
before it reaches ground level?

52:15.630 --> 52:20.150
<i>It should. But it doesn't.
The air's descending too rapidly.</i>

52:21.150 --> 52:23.630
Is this an isolated incident?

52:26.190 --> 52:28.110
I'm afraid not.

52:28.270 --> 52:31.410
We've located two other super cells
in addition to the one over Scotland.

52:31.510 --> 52:33.430
There is one over Northern Canada

52:33.590 --> 52:36.630
<i>and another one over Siberia.</i>

52:36.790 --> 52:39.390
And do we know
their projected paths?

52:39.590 --> 52:41.360
<i>Yes.</i>

52:41.460 --> 52:44.310
<i>Our previous estimates of six to
eight weeks weren't even close.</i>

52:44.510 --> 52:47.990
<i>This one storm is going to change
the face of our planet.</i>

52:48.190 --> 52:52.030
<i>Here's a projection of 24 hours out.</i>

52:56.790 --> 52:59.030
This is 48 hours out.

53:00.790 --> 53:03.710
<i>And in seven to ten days...</i>

53:06.790 --> 53:09.070
<i>When this storm is over</i>

53:09.230 --> 53:12.070
<i>we'll be in a new Ice Age.</i>

53:16.070 --> 53:17.470
My god.

53:36.230 --> 53:38.070
Professor...

53:38.270 --> 53:40.270
It's time you got out of there.

53:42.270 --> 53:45.430
I'm afraid that time has
come and gone, my friend.

53:50.470 --> 53:52.750
What can we do?

53:55.990 --> 53:58.510
Save as many as you can.

54:13.470 --> 54:14.470
Jack.

54:15.310 --> 54:17.550
Something's happened in New York.

54:28.150 --> 54:31.040
No, the power is out.
I've been in here all day.

54:31.140 --> 54:34.230
- Who needs help?
- Here. Over here.

54:40.990 --> 54:41.990
What?

54:43.470 --> 54:46.790
This is the last one. Enjoy it.

54:46.950 --> 54:48.350
Greedy.

54:49.670 --> 54:52.030
<i>All circuits are busy at this time.</i>

54:52.190 --> 54:54.190
Listen, thanks for coming back for me.

54:55.990 --> 54:57.710
It was really brave.

55:09.790 --> 55:12.190
I guess I better return her bag.

55:29.510 --> 55:30.510
Sam?

55:31.350 --> 55:33.430
Just tell her how you feel.

55:37.470 --> 55:38.470
Yeah.

55:44.030 --> 55:45.380
Did you reach your
little brother yet?

55:45.480 --> 55:47.260
No, there's still no service.

55:47.870 --> 55:49.910
Damn cell phones.

55:54.150 --> 55:55.380
- Excuse me.
- Yes.

55:55.480 --> 55:57.480
Are there any pay phones
on the upper floors?

55:57.580 --> 55:58.690
No, no, no.

55:58.890 --> 56:00.730
Ah. But there are some
on the mezzanine.

56:00.830 --> 56:01.510
Great.

56:01.610 --> 56:04.590
- Oh, but I think it's underwater.
- Where you going? Power's out.

56:04.790 --> 56:07.270
Older payphones draw their power
directly from the telephone line.

56:07.430 --> 56:10.990
<i>There will be an emergency meeting
of all NOAA department heads...</i>

56:11.750 --> 56:14.630
Oh, god. I've been
trying to reach Sam.

56:14.790 --> 56:15.850
So have I.

56:16.890 --> 56:18.870
I tried to call you
but I couldn't get through.

56:18.970 --> 56:21.350
It's been a madhouse around here.
Come on.

56:26.950 --> 56:29.230
Are you sure about this?

56:39.270 --> 56:40.590
It works.

56:45.990 --> 56:47.470
I love that picture.

56:47.670 --> 56:49.870
Yeah, so do I.

56:50.830 --> 56:52.190
Where was that taken?

56:52.350 --> 56:53.550
Miami.

56:54.110 --> 56:56.510
Well, where was I?
I don't remember that trip.

56:56.670 --> 56:59.470
Sam and I went with my sister.
You were in Alaska,

56:59.630 --> 57:02.550
doing research on your doctorate.

57:06.350 --> 57:09.310
Remember what he was like
when he was that age?

57:09.790 --> 57:11.990
Everything was "one more."

57:12.190 --> 57:13.640
One more bedtime story.

57:13.740 --> 57:15.940
One more ride on my shoulders.
"One more, daddy."

57:18.990 --> 57:23.190
Jack. Sam's on the phone.
Line four.

57:23.350 --> 57:25.230
- Sam?
- Dad!

57:25.390 --> 57:26.620
<i>Where are you?
Are you all right?</i>

57:26.720 --> 57:28.570
I'm all right.
We're at the Public Library.

57:28.870 --> 57:30.260
<i>Sam, it's Mom.</i>

57:30.360 --> 57:32.810
- I'm so happy you're okay.
- Mom.

57:33.390 --> 57:35.270
Can you call Laura and
Brian's parents

57:35.370 --> 57:36.770
and tell them we're all right?

57:36.870 --> 57:38.550
<i>Yes, of course.</i>

57:39.750 --> 57:41.950
- Sam, what's that noise?
- Sam?

57:42.430 --> 57:43.430
Sam?

57:46.390 --> 57:48.950
<i>What is going on out there, dad?</i>

57:49.190 --> 57:51.310
Sam. Sam, listen to me.

57:51.470 --> 57:52.870
Listen very carefully.

57:53.070 --> 57:55.150
Forget what I said about
trying to head south.

57:55.350 --> 57:57.510
It's too late for that.
The storm is just gonna get worse.

57:58.310 --> 57:59.770
<i>It's gonna turn into
a massive blizzard</i>

57:59.870 --> 58:02.470
<i>with an eye in the center of it,
just like a huge hurricane.</i>

58:02.570 --> 58:03.570
Uh huh.

58:03.830 --> 58:06.910
Only the air is gonna be so cold.
You could freeze to death in seconds.

58:10.750 --> 58:11.750
Sam?

58:12.190 --> 58:13.290
Well, what should we do?

58:13.690 --> 58:14.690
Listen to me, son.

58:15.270 --> 58:16.950
Do not go outside.

58:17.110 --> 58:18.740
Just burn whatever you can
to stay warm,

58:18.840 --> 58:19.990
and try to wait it out.

58:20.190 --> 58:22.570
I will come for you.
Do you understand me?

58:22.670 --> 58:23.920
I will come for you.

58:27.390 --> 58:28.390
Sam?

58:29.270 --> 58:30.200
- Sam, come back!

58:30.300 --> 58:31.420
- Sam?
- Sam?

58:32.130 --> 58:34.390
<i>Sam, did you hear me?</i>

58:34.550 --> 58:35.830
<i>Did you hear me?</i>

58:38.430 --> 58:39.430
Sam?

58:41.070 --> 58:45.030
- Tell me he's gonna be okay...
- He's gonna be all right.

58:45.230 --> 58:47.230
He's gonna be all right,
do you understand me?

59:14.230 --> 59:16.950
I thought you'd drowned.

59:22.110 --> 59:25.550
Let's find some dry clothes
for you. Come on.

59:31.510 --> 59:33.270
Where'd you store
the arctic gear?

59:34.430 --> 59:36.270
You can't make it
to New York, Jack.

59:36.430 --> 59:38.790
I've walked that far before
in the snow.

59:39.630 --> 59:41.350
This is not the same.

59:41.550 --> 59:45.790
Jack, this is not the same.
Lucy, tell him.

59:48.110 --> 59:50.310
I have to do this.

59:52.470 --> 59:53.870
I know.

01:00:01.230 --> 01:00:03.270
My hands are shak...

01:00:03.430 --> 01:00:06.870
- Shaking.
- That's okay. Here.

01:00:07.030 --> 01:00:08.990
Here. Come here.

01:00:12.750 --> 01:00:14.550
What are you doing?

01:00:14.750 --> 01:00:17.190
I'm using my body heat
to warm you.

01:00:17.470 --> 01:00:18.590
If we let the blood

01:00:18.690 --> 01:00:21.540
from your arms and legs rush
back to your heart too quickly

01:00:22.790 --> 01:00:25.270
your heart could fail.

01:00:30.350 --> 01:00:32.790
Where did you learn that?

01:00:34.950 --> 01:00:38.830
Some of us were actually
paying attention in health class.

01:00:41.230 --> 01:00:43.190
How are you feeling?

01:00:45.590 --> 01:00:47.430
Much better.

01:00:54.350 --> 01:00:56.790
Frank told me about Sam.

01:00:56.950 --> 01:00:58.820
I'm not gonna try to
talk you out of going,

01:00:58.920 --> 01:01:00.740
but there's something I need
for you do first.

01:01:01.270 --> 01:01:04.010
You have to explain your results
to the Administration.

01:01:04.110 --> 01:01:07.070
- I already tried that, Tom.
- I know. This time will be different.

01:01:07.790 --> 01:01:09.910
You're gonna brief
the President directly.

01:01:12.590 --> 01:01:14.670
- Is that the last of it?
- Yeah. Pretty much.

01:01:14.870 --> 01:01:15.870
Okay.

01:01:16.630 --> 01:01:19.670
We also found this radio,
but I don't think it works.

01:01:20.070 --> 01:01:21.790
Let me see it.

01:01:28.270 --> 01:01:30.050
Buddha, keep quiet.

01:01:30.150 --> 01:01:32.950
You ain't even supposed
to be in here anyway.

01:02:28.550 --> 01:02:29.950
Come on, guys.

01:02:37.070 --> 01:02:38.790
Oh, my god.

01:03:01.490 --> 01:03:03.800
The basic rule of storms
is that they continue

01:03:03.900 --> 01:03:07.310
until the imbalance that
created them is corrected.

01:03:07.510 --> 01:03:10.230
In this case, we're talking
about a global realignment.

01:03:11.350 --> 01:03:14.330
This superstorm will last
seven to ten days.

01:03:14.430 --> 01:03:15.410
When it's over,

01:03:15.510 --> 01:03:19.150
ice and snow will cover
the entire Northern Hemisphere.

01:03:19.750 --> 01:03:22.310
The ice and snow
will reflect sunlight.

01:03:22.510 --> 01:03:24.610
The Earth's atmosphere
will restabilize

01:03:24.710 --> 01:03:28.110
but with an average temperature
close to that of the last Ice Age.

01:03:30.430 --> 01:03:32.350
Well, what can we do about this?

01:03:33.910 --> 01:03:35.870
Head as far south as possible.

01:03:36.550 --> 01:03:38.150
That is not amusing, professor.

01:03:38.510 --> 01:03:40.590
Where do you suggest they go?

01:03:40.790 --> 01:03:43.190
The farther south they go,
the safer they'll be.

01:03:43.350 --> 01:03:46.230
Texas. Parts of Florida
that aren't flooded.

01:03:46.630 --> 01:03:48.040
Mexico would be best.

01:03:48.140 --> 01:03:51.830
Mexico? Maybe you should stick
to science and leave policy to us.

01:03:51.990 --> 01:03:53.510
Well, we tried that approach.

01:03:53.610 --> 01:03:55.140
You didn't want to hear
about the science

01:03:55.240 --> 01:03:56.790
when it could have
made a difference.

01:03:59.450 --> 01:04:01.970
What exactly are you proposing,
professor?

01:04:08.090 --> 01:04:13.210
Evacuate everyone south of that line.

01:04:19.210 --> 01:04:21.210
What about the people in the North?

01:04:23.570 --> 01:04:25.930
I'm afraid it's too late for them.

01:04:26.090 --> 01:04:28.250
If they go outside

01:04:28.450 --> 01:04:30.330
the storm will kill them.

01:04:33.650 --> 01:04:35.490
At this point

01:04:36.530 --> 01:04:39.330
their best chance is
to stay inside.

01:04:40.410 --> 01:04:42.530
Try to ride it out.

01:04:43.330 --> 01:04:44.330
Pray.

01:04:49.810 --> 01:04:51.370
What do you think he'll do?

01:04:51.530 --> 01:04:53.410
I don't know.

01:04:53.570 --> 01:04:54.570
Jack.

01:04:55.810 --> 01:04:57.170
Thanks...

01:04:57.330 --> 01:04:58.690
and good luck.

01:04:58.890 --> 01:05:00.490
You too.

01:05:02.690 --> 01:05:04.810
We're all gonna need it.

01:05:07.330 --> 01:05:09.340
We can't evacuate half the country

01:05:09.440 --> 01:05:12.490
because one scientist
thinks the climate is shifting.

01:05:12.610 --> 01:05:14.980
Every minute we delay
is costing lives.

01:05:15.080 --> 01:05:16.640
What about the other half
of the country?

01:05:16.740 --> 01:05:19.210
If Professor Hall is right
about this storm pattern

01:05:19.310 --> 01:05:21.990
sending troops north will
create more victims.

01:05:22.090 --> 01:05:24.340
We need to save the people
we can right now.

01:05:24.440 --> 01:05:27.570
We take the same approach
in triage on the battlefield.

01:05:27.670 --> 01:05:30.790
Sometimes it's necessary
to make difficult choices...

01:05:30.890 --> 01:05:33.880
I don't accept that abandoning
half the country is necessary.

01:05:33.980 --> 01:05:36.310
Maybe if you would've listened to
him sooner, it wouldn't be.

01:05:36.470 --> 01:05:38.600
Bullshit. It's easy for him
to suggest this plan.

01:05:38.700 --> 01:05:42.390
- He's safely here in Washington.
- His son is in Manhattan.

01:05:45.910 --> 01:05:46.940
I just thought that
you should know that

01:05:47.040 --> 01:05:48.690
before you start
questioning his motives.

01:05:51.830 --> 01:05:53.550
We're going to follow Hall's plan.

01:05:55.910 --> 01:05:57.310
- General.
- Sir?

01:05:57.510 --> 01:06:00.780
Give the order for the National Guard
to evacuate the southern states.

01:06:00.880 --> 01:06:02.630
Yes, sir.

01:06:17.190 --> 01:06:18.750
Vivian...

01:06:18.950 --> 01:06:20.750
get me my wife.

01:06:39.710 --> 01:06:43.150
Sorry, mates, but we're
just about out of petrol.

01:06:46.470 --> 01:06:47.470
Hey.

01:06:48.430 --> 01:06:49.990
Is there any chance...

01:06:50.630 --> 01:06:52.070
that it'll run...

01:06:53.390 --> 01:06:54.990
on this?

01:06:55.430 --> 01:06:57.030
Are you mad?

01:06:57.230 --> 01:06:59.550
That's a 12-year-old Scotch.

01:07:21.350 --> 01:07:22.630
Gentlemen.

01:07:23.590 --> 01:07:25.710
To England.

01:07:26.590 --> 01:07:28.470
To mankind.

01:07:30.550 --> 01:07:32.430
To Manchester United.

01:07:40.270 --> 01:07:41.550
I just...

01:07:41.710 --> 01:07:45.630
I just wish I could have seen
him grow up. You know?

01:07:49.310 --> 01:07:52.150
The important thing is
he will grow up.

01:07:57.150 --> 01:07:58.150
Amen.

01:08:15.510 --> 01:08:18.270
Maybe you should have somebody
help you with that, you know.

01:08:18.910 --> 01:08:21.710
Sir, I am president of the
Electronics Club

01:08:21.870 --> 01:08:24.149
the Math Club
and the Chess Club.

01:08:24.310 --> 01:08:27.390
Now, if there's a bigger nerd in here,
please, point him out.

01:08:29.790 --> 01:08:32.710
I'll just leave you alone
to work on it, okay?

01:08:33.790 --> 01:08:36.990
Come on, Buddha, come on.
Do your business.

01:08:37.149 --> 01:08:39.990
Look, there's nobody around.

01:08:40.149 --> 01:08:41.140
OK. You know what?

01:08:41.240 --> 01:08:43.290
I'll turn around.
I won't look. I promise.

01:08:47.189 --> 01:08:48.189
What?

01:08:55.590 --> 01:08:57.430
Hey, man, there is people out there.

01:08:57.830 --> 01:08:58.970
I was walking my dog.

01:08:59.069 --> 01:09:03.350
There is hundreds of them.
They're walking on the snow.

01:09:11.350 --> 01:09:12.569
Where they all going?

01:09:12.729 --> 01:09:15.910
They're getting out of the city
before it's too late.

01:09:19.069 --> 01:09:21.630
All right, everybody. Quiet down.

01:09:21.890 --> 01:09:24.890
When was the last time anyone
got a signal on a cell phone?

01:09:24.990 --> 01:09:27.950
Well, I got through to my cousin
in Memphis an hour ago.

01:09:28.109 --> 01:09:29.990
They're being
evacuated to the South.

01:09:30.149 --> 01:09:31.529
We should get moving too.

01:09:31.630 --> 01:09:34.510
The water is frozen over
enough to walk on.

01:09:34.670 --> 01:09:37.870
We should get going before
the snow gets too deep.

01:09:38.029 --> 01:09:41.630
Everyone, wrap yourselves up
as fast as you can.

01:09:41.729 --> 01:09:43.310
- We shouldn't go.
- We're leaving in five minutes.

01:09:43.410 --> 01:09:45.350
Why not, Sam? Everyone's leaving.

01:09:45.510 --> 01:09:48.189
When I talked to my dad,
he told me to stay inside.

01:09:48.390 --> 01:09:50.109
The storm will kill anybody caught in it.

01:09:50.270 --> 01:09:53.029
- Then you have to say something.
- I know.

01:09:57.150 --> 01:09:59.710
Excuse me, sir, you're making a mistake.

01:09:59.870 --> 01:10:02.790
What? Listen son, we're all scared,
but we've got no choice.

01:10:02.950 --> 01:10:04.550
- That's not it.
- Get ready to go.

01:10:04.750 --> 01:10:08.190
If these people go outside,
they will freeze to death!

01:10:09.070 --> 01:10:10.830
Okay, what is this nonsense?

01:10:10.990 --> 01:10:14.670
It's not nonsense. All right?
Look, this storm is gonna get worse.

01:10:14.830 --> 01:10:17.270
The people who are caught outside
they will freeze to death.

01:10:17.430 --> 01:10:20.230
- Where are you getting this information?
- My father's a climatologist.

01:10:20.390 --> 01:10:22.990
- He works for the government.
- So what are you suggesting we do?

01:10:23.190 --> 01:10:25.830
We stay inside, we keep warm,
and we wait it out.

01:10:26.030 --> 01:10:28.150
The snow is getting deeper
by the minute.

01:10:28.310 --> 01:10:30.910
We'd be trapped here
without food, supplies...

01:10:31.070 --> 01:10:33.150
- It's a risk, yeah...
- An unnecessary risk.

01:10:33.310 --> 01:10:34.550
No, no. It's not.

01:10:34.790 --> 01:10:37.150
We've wasted enough time talking about this.
Come on, people

01:10:37.310 --> 01:10:38.390
Let's go.

01:10:38.490 --> 01:10:41.610
- Look, look. Just look for a second.
- Come on, everybody...

01:10:41.710 --> 01:10:42.740
- One second.
- Let's get going.

01:10:42.840 --> 01:10:45.790
The storm is gonna get bad.
It's gonna get really, really bad.

01:10:45.950 --> 01:10:48.070
You're not gonna
be able to survive it.

01:10:49.350 --> 01:10:50.670
Believe me.

01:10:50.830 --> 01:10:55.110
Sir, please just stay.
Just stay.

01:10:55.950 --> 01:10:58.110
Just don't...

01:11:27.230 --> 01:11:30.350
She's set to go.
Come on, straight to the back, guys.

01:11:30.550 --> 01:11:32.410
<i>It'll be impossible to reach each other.</i>

01:11:32.510 --> 01:11:35.330
<i>Leave a message for me at the
American Embassy in Mexico City.</i>

01:11:35.430 --> 01:11:36.830
Okay, I will.

01:11:38.510 --> 01:11:39.950
I love you.

01:11:43.350 --> 01:11:45.750
I love you, Jack.

01:11:46.590 --> 01:11:49.510
Tell Sam I love him so much.

01:11:51.030 --> 01:11:52.950
God be with you.

01:12:00.110 --> 01:12:02.150
- Doctor Hall?
- Yeah.

01:12:02.310 --> 01:12:04.710
We haven't been able to
reach Peter's parents.

01:12:04.870 --> 01:12:08.430
- I'm gonna try it later, okay?
- Okay. Thank you.

01:12:15.830 --> 01:12:17.630
I got it.

01:12:18.630 --> 01:12:21.270
You're supposed to be on a bus
heading south.

01:12:21.430 --> 01:12:23.520
I've been watching your back
for 20 years.

01:12:23.620 --> 01:12:24.890
You think I'd let you go alone?

01:12:26.110 --> 01:12:29.350
All these years I thought
I was watching your back.

01:12:29.510 --> 01:12:31.270
Where are the keys?

01:12:31.430 --> 01:12:33.190
In the truck.

01:12:33.750 --> 01:12:36.190
Where do you think you're going?

01:12:36.350 --> 01:12:38.790
Neither one of you knows how to
navigate worth a damn.

01:12:38.950 --> 01:12:40.950
Without me,
you'll end up in Cleveland.

01:12:43.150 --> 01:12:46.350
I'll try to give you updates on
the storm as it heads your way.

01:12:46.910 --> 01:12:48.870
Good luck, Jack.

01:13:02.590 --> 01:13:05.310
Breaking news from
the U.S.-Mexico border.

01:13:05.470 --> 01:13:08.710
Just half an hour ago,
Mexican officials closed the border

01:13:08.810 --> 01:13:12.750
in the light of so many U.S. refugees
who are fleeing south

01:13:12.850 --> 01:13:14.670
in the wake of the
approaching storm.

01:13:14.970 --> 01:13:18.230
These people came here in
anticipation of crossing into Mexico.

01:13:18.430 --> 01:13:20.490
Instead, they've been met
with closed gates.

01:13:20.590 --> 01:13:24.110
And now, in a dramatic reversal
of illegal immigration

01:13:24.270 --> 01:13:27.830
thousands of people are crossing
the Rio Grande into Mexico.

01:13:27.990 --> 01:13:29.660
The scene that unfolding
here behind me

01:13:29.760 --> 01:13:31.730
is one of desperation
and frustration.

01:13:31.830 --> 01:13:35.350
People have abandoned their cars,
grabbed their belongings

01:13:35.550 --> 01:13:40.110
and they are wading across
the river illegally into Mexico.

01:13:42.550 --> 01:13:44.110
Here it is.

01:13:45.630 --> 01:13:48.990
This fireplace probably hasn't
been used in about 100 years.

01:13:51.750 --> 01:13:53.430
All right.

01:13:59.990 --> 01:14:02.710
- What are you doing?
- What did you think we're gonna burn?

01:14:03.110 --> 01:14:06.230
- You can't burn books.
- No, absolutely not.

01:14:06.390 --> 01:14:08.150
You wanna freeze to death?

01:14:11.270 --> 01:14:13.310
I'll go get some more.

01:14:13.510 --> 01:14:14.990
I'll help you.

01:14:15.430 --> 01:14:17.550
I'm going with them.

01:14:18.830 --> 01:14:21.250
Okay, do you have a cafeteria
or a lunchroom?

01:14:21.350 --> 01:14:24.350
Just an employees' lounge
with a few vending machines.

01:14:32.230 --> 01:14:34.790
We're not gonna last very long
on MandM's and potato chips.

01:14:35.030 --> 01:14:37.150
What about the garbage cans?

01:14:37.310 --> 01:14:39.830
There's always something
to eat in the garbage.

01:14:43.990 --> 01:14:46.630
Friedrich Nietzsche?
We can not burn Nietzsche.

01:14:46.830 --> 01:14:49.830
He was the most important
thinker of the 19th century.

01:14:49.990 --> 01:14:52.950
Please. Nietzsche was a chauvinist
pig who was in love with his sister.

01:14:53.190 --> 01:14:54.750
He was not a chauvinist pig.

01:14:55.230 --> 01:14:57.230
But he was in love
with his sister.

01:14:57.390 --> 01:14:59.070
Excuse me? you guys?

01:14:59.230 --> 01:15:01.800
Yeah, there's a whole section
on tax law down here

01:15:01.900 --> 01:15:02.900
that we can burn.

01:15:03.390 --> 01:15:07.070
<i>After hours of uncertainty,
the traffic is now moving smoothly</i>

01:15:07.170 --> 01:15:09.300
<i>from the United States into Mexico.</i>

01:15:09.400 --> 01:15:13.190
<i>This is only possible because the
president was able to negotiate a deal</i>

01:15:13.290 --> 01:15:17.990
<i>to forgive all Latin American debt
in exchange for opening the border.</i>

01:15:18.150 --> 01:15:22.310
<i>Now, multitudes of American
families are feeling a rush of relief...</i>

01:15:25.990 --> 01:15:26.990
Lucy?

01:15:33.590 --> 01:15:35.070
Is Peter's ambulance here?

01:15:35.230 --> 01:15:36.230
No.

01:15:42.110 --> 01:15:44.590
- Why?
- They've all gone.

01:15:44.750 --> 01:15:46.350
- What?
- In the confusion...

01:15:46.510 --> 01:15:47.660
I don't know what happened.

01:15:47.760 --> 01:15:50.040
People just started to panic,
and they left, and...

01:15:50.140 --> 01:15:52.640
- God.
- Now there's a policeman with a snowplow.

01:15:52.740 --> 01:15:55.270
- He's waiting outside.
- God.

01:15:55.430 --> 01:15:57.870
Peter can't be moved in anything
but an ambulance.

01:15:58.670 --> 01:16:02.950
I called and left a message
for the county ambulance service.

01:16:10.590 --> 01:16:11.590
Okay.

01:16:14.430 --> 01:16:16.830
Okay, you should go,
and I'll stay and wait.

01:16:17.390 --> 01:16:18.670
Lucy, no.

01:16:18.830 --> 01:16:20.670
- No.
- No, you should go.

01:16:20.830 --> 01:16:22.790
He's not gonna wait forever.

01:16:22.950 --> 01:16:24.830
It's okay.

01:16:27.390 --> 01:16:29.390
I'm sorry.

01:16:30.110 --> 01:16:33.070
- It's okay.
- All right.

01:17:01.390 --> 01:17:02.990
You all right?

01:17:03.150 --> 01:17:06.150
Yeah, I'm fine. I just...
I cut my leg the other day.

01:17:10.350 --> 01:17:11.630
Did you get a signal?

01:17:11.790 --> 01:17:13.870
Yeah, for a minute.

01:17:14.030 --> 01:17:15.030
And?

01:17:19.350 --> 01:17:21.510
Man, this storm is everywhere.

01:17:21.670 --> 01:17:24.110
It's hit the entire Northern Hemisphere.

01:17:24.790 --> 01:17:27.350
Europe is buried under
15 feet of snow

01:17:27.510 --> 01:17:30.270
and they say it's gonna get
just as bad here.

01:17:30.870 --> 01:17:33.590
I mean, I don't think your dad's
gonna make it.

01:17:37.430 --> 01:17:39.030
No, he'll make it.

01:17:43.790 --> 01:17:45.670
He'll make it.

01:17:50.190 --> 01:17:53.030
<i>The White House has ordered
the following national disaster alert</i>

01:17:53.190 --> 01:17:54.380
<i>for all Northern states.</i>

01:17:54.480 --> 01:17:57.510
<i>Continued exposure to
the approaching storm is deadly.</i>

01:17:57.710 --> 01:18:00.190
<i>Remain indoors and

01:18:00.290 --> 01:18:02.910

<i>as far south as Pennsylvania...</i>

01:18:07.760 --> 01:18:10.190
Where are we?

01:18:12.190 --> 01:18:15.070
Looks like we're just north
of Philadelphia.

01:18:18.310 --> 01:18:19.950
Look out!

01:18:24.270 --> 01:18:26.030
You guys okay?

01:18:26.230 --> 01:18:27.590
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

<i>Once again, the roads across the...</i>

01:18:35.340 --> 01:18:36.340
Sorry, boss.

01:18:37.590 --> 01:18:39.990
Unpack the snowshoes.

01:18:40.190 --> 01:18:42.110
We're walking from here.

01:18:43.670 --> 01:18:46.510
Come on, ma'am.
Let's get up and get going.

01:18:47.670 --> 01:18:51.390
We've only made it to Brooklyn.
Maybe we should just turn back.

01:18:51.550 --> 01:18:54.000
What for? Half the city's
frozen under water.

01:18:54.100 --> 01:18:55.230
There's nothing to go back to.

01:18:55.330 --> 01:18:56.510
Time to get up and keep moving.

01:18:56.620 --> 01:18:58.480
What we should've done
is stayed in the library.

01:18:58.580 --> 01:18:59.580
Come on, man.

01:19:01.470 --> 01:19:04.230
Okay, guys, let's get moving.

01:19:13.790 --> 01:19:15.390
Wake up.

01:19:33.310 --> 01:19:34.830
What are you doing?

01:19:34.990 --> 01:19:36.670
Insulating.

01:19:36.870 --> 01:19:39.310
Newspaper's best, but this'll do.

01:19:39.630 --> 01:19:41.360
You know, you spend some
years on the streets

01:19:41.460 --> 01:19:42.830
and you learn how to keep warm.

01:19:44.590 --> 01:19:45.590
Hey.

01:19:51.670 --> 01:19:53.070
Thanks.

01:19:57.150 --> 01:19:59.150
I got one.

01:19:59.350 --> 01:20:01.390
Your favorite vacation.

01:20:03.070 --> 01:20:05.030
Besides this one?

01:20:05.990 --> 01:20:06.900
All right.

01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:08.590
I went to Greenland with my dad

01:20:08.690 --> 01:20:10.840
on one of his research trips
a few years ago...

01:20:14.110 --> 01:20:18.630
and the ship broke down,
and we got stuck.

01:20:19.670 --> 01:20:22.270
And it rained constantly.

01:20:24.150 --> 01:20:26.430
That sounds really boring.

01:20:27.630 --> 01:20:30.110
But actually really nice, you know?

01:20:30.270 --> 01:20:33.710
Just me and my dad
hanging out for 10 days.

01:21:46.310 --> 01:21:47.510
Frank!

01:21:48.390 --> 01:21:50.030
Are you all right?

01:21:50.190 --> 01:21:51.390
I'm fine.

01:21:53.150 --> 01:21:55.870
I just dropped in
to do a little shopping.

01:21:57.190 --> 01:21:58.750
I gotta lose this sled.

01:22:15.030 --> 01:22:17.830
Hold on! We'll pull you up.

01:22:20.310 --> 01:22:23.270
Jason! you've got to support
Frank's weight.

01:22:23.470 --> 01:22:26.230
Okay, I'll try.

01:22:32.630 --> 01:22:35.230
Okay, I think I have his weight now.

01:22:35.390 --> 01:22:37.110
I'm coming to you.

01:22:49.830 --> 01:22:52.470
The glass is breaking!

01:22:54.630 --> 01:22:56.110
Too much weight.

01:23:00.030 --> 01:23:01.510
It's not gonna hold.

01:23:11.350 --> 01:23:12.590
No. No.

01:23:13.030 --> 01:23:15.910
Frank. I can get you out.

01:23:18.270 --> 01:23:19.790
Don't do it!

01:23:19.950 --> 01:23:22.390
- No, Frank, no!
- Frank, no!

01:23:24.030 --> 01:23:25.230
Frank!

01:24:09.430 --> 01:24:11.310
What have you got there?

01:24:12.230 --> 01:24:14.590
A Gutenberg Bible.

01:24:14.790 --> 01:24:17.110
It was in the rare books room.

01:24:18.230 --> 01:24:20.110
You think god's gonna save you?

01:24:20.870 --> 01:24:23.630
No. I don't believe in god.

01:24:24.310 --> 01:24:26.990
You're holding onto that Bible
pretty tight.

01:24:27.150 --> 01:24:29.150
I'm protecting it.

01:24:32.670 --> 01:24:36.150
This Bible is the first book
ever printed.

01:24:36.990 --> 01:24:41.950
It represents the dawn
of the age of reason.

01:24:42.310 --> 01:24:43.270
As far as I'm concerned,

01:24:43.370 --> 01:24:45.580
the written word is mankind's
greatest achievement.

01:24:46.710 --> 01:24:48.230
You can laugh.

01:24:48.970 --> 01:24:52.390
But if Western civilization
is finished

01:24:52.990 --> 01:24:56.990
I'm gonna save
at least one little piece of it.

01:25:33.750 --> 01:25:35.870
We heard somebody
was left behind.

01:25:36.830 --> 01:25:40.510
- We brought an ambulance.
- Thank god.

01:25:42.730 --> 01:25:45.710
Thank you so much for coming.

01:26:06.670 --> 01:26:07.670
Hey.

01:26:09.070 --> 01:26:11.310
Hey, are you all right?

01:26:12.550 --> 01:26:14.710
You look like you have a fever
or something.

01:26:14.870 --> 01:26:17.990
I'm fine. I just can't sleep.

01:26:20.910 --> 01:26:26.470
My mind keeps going over
all those worthless decathlon facts.

01:26:28.070 --> 01:26:30.400
- It's pretty stupid, huh?
- No, it's all right.

01:26:30.500 --> 01:26:34.030
I guess you just haven't had
time to adjust yet.

01:26:35.830 --> 01:26:38.390
How am I supposed to adjust, Sam?

01:26:38.990 --> 01:26:42.910
Everything I've ever cared about,
everything I've worked for

01:26:43.430 --> 01:26:47.070
has all been preparation for
a future that no longer exists.

01:26:50.590 --> 01:26:54.590
I know you always thought I took
the competition too seriously.

01:26:55.910 --> 01:26:57.710
You were right.

01:26:58.350 --> 01:27:01.310
- It was all for nothing.
- No, no. I...

01:27:02.270 --> 01:27:06.510
No, I just... I just said that
to avoid admitting the truth.

01:27:07.950 --> 01:27:09.550
Truth about what?

01:27:13.590 --> 01:27:16.990
About why I joined the team.

01:27:22.110 --> 01:27:24.270
I joined it because of you.

01:27:37.390 --> 01:27:38.390
Hey.

01:28:04.670 --> 01:28:06.070
I know.

01:28:06.710 --> 01:28:07.950
I know.

01:28:08.110 --> 01:28:10.190
- Mr. President.
- All right.

01:28:10.910 --> 01:28:13.350
I'm sorry, sir,
we can't wait any longer.

01:28:13.870 --> 01:28:15.870
We're the last ones.

01:28:16.790 --> 01:28:18.350
All right.

01:28:33.350 --> 01:28:35.880
<i>Mexicali Control, this is Delta 26.</i>

01:28:35.980 --> 01:28:38.220
<i>We've got an urgent message
for high command.</i>

01:28:38.320 --> 01:28:41.070
<i>Request priority
for landing zone one.</i>

01:28:41.230 --> 01:28:45.190
<i>Roger that, Delta 26.
Transport will be waiting.</i>

01:28:50.270 --> 01:28:51.670
- Sir.
- Thank you, corporal.

01:28:51.830 --> 01:28:53.990
- Sorry for the delay, sir.
- Carry on.

01:29:06.790 --> 01:29:08.670
Madam Secretary.

01:29:18.230 --> 01:29:19.830
Raymond.

01:29:20.790 --> 01:29:23.270
The president's motorcade
got caught in the storm.

01:29:28.350 --> 01:29:29.950
They didn't make it.

01:29:36.110 --> 01:29:38.430
And she wouldn't wake up
this morning. I...

01:29:39.030 --> 01:29:40.480
I mean last night
she only had a fever.

01:29:40.580 --> 01:29:41.550
I don't understand.

01:29:41.650 --> 01:29:43.790
She's awfully pale.

01:29:44.030 --> 01:29:44.870
Well guys, look.

01:29:44.970 --> 01:29:46.710
None of us has had anything
real to eat in days.

01:29:46.810 --> 01:29:49.670
- I'm telling you it's hypothermia.
- But how can it be hypothermia?

01:29:49.830 --> 01:29:52.090
- We've all been in...
- Look maybe it's just the flu, you guys.

01:29:52.190 --> 01:29:54.390
No, no, it's not the flu.

01:29:55.590 --> 01:29:56.790
And how do you know?

01:29:57.310 --> 01:29:59.320
Books can be good for
something other than burning.

01:29:59.420 --> 01:30:00.860
All right,
let's go for her symptoms?

01:30:00.960 --> 01:30:02.290
I told you that she has
a fever and her...

01:30:02.390 --> 01:30:04.410
She's got a really cold sweat.

01:30:04.510 --> 01:30:05.750
How's her pulse?

01:30:07.190 --> 01:30:09.700
- It's really fast.
- Does she have any injuries?

01:30:09.800 --> 01:30:12.270
Like a cut or something that
might have gotten infected?

01:30:12.430 --> 01:30:15.950
She was complaining about a cut
on her leg a few days ago.

01:30:16.510 --> 01:30:19.350
I didn't think anything of it.

01:30:23.790 --> 01:30:25.510
Oh, my gosh.

01:30:26.750 --> 01:30:29.870
That's blood poisoning.
Uh, Septicemia.

01:30:30.070 --> 01:30:32.190
She could go into septic shock.

01:30:32.350 --> 01:30:33.980
I've seen that before.
That can get bad.

01:30:34.080 --> 01:30:36.290
She needs a massive dose
of penicillin...

01:30:36.390 --> 01:30:40.430
or a broad-spectrum
antibiotic immediately, or...

01:30:46.190 --> 01:30:47.790
Or what?

01:31:07.630 --> 01:31:09.910
I've never seen anything like it.

01:31:10.150 --> 01:31:13.750
There's no point of reference.
All I could see is cloud cover.

01:31:13.910 --> 01:31:15.430
What are you doing?

01:31:15.590 --> 01:31:17.950
Taking infrared image of
thermal currents.

01:31:18.110 --> 01:31:22.830
Send to Houston, Korolev,
your weather service.

01:31:23.030 --> 01:31:24.590
I'll help you.

01:31:25.670 --> 01:31:28.110
Tom? Tom, wake up.

01:31:28.270 --> 01:31:30.620
I just received some satellite
images from the space station.

01:31:30.720 --> 01:31:31.720
You better take a look.

01:31:44.190 --> 01:31:45.710
How big is this thing?

01:31:45.870 --> 01:31:47.910
The vortex is 50 miles in diameter.

01:31:48.070 --> 01:31:51.750
And growing. The two cells
over Europe and Asia are even bigger.

01:31:51.910 --> 01:31:53.230
Good god.

01:31:53.390 --> 01:31:56.350
This one's gonna hit New York
inside an hour.

01:32:12.830 --> 01:32:14.030
Jason!

01:32:14.470 --> 01:32:16.110
Are you all right?

01:32:16.590 --> 01:32:17.790
Jason!

01:32:34.350 --> 01:32:35.430
What are you doing?

01:32:35.830 --> 01:32:37.730
There's gotta be medicine
on that ship.

01:32:37.990 --> 01:32:41.350
I thought you said it was too
dangerous to go outside.

01:32:41.510 --> 01:32:42.830
I know I did.

01:32:49.150 --> 01:32:51.550
Where did you find those chairs?

01:32:52.910 --> 01:32:53.910
Why?

01:32:55.110 --> 01:32:56.670
I'm going with you.

01:32:58.150 --> 01:32:59.550
Me too.

01:34:03.150 --> 01:34:05.030
Come on, damn it!

01:34:53.750 --> 01:34:56.150
- It's all in Russian. I...
- I know.

01:34:56.550 --> 01:34:59.790
- Hey, hey, hey, guys. I found it.
- What? How do you know?

01:35:00.270 --> 01:35:02.590
Because it says "penicillin"
on the bottle.

01:35:07.950 --> 01:35:09.670
Hey, wait a minute.
This is the mess hall.

01:35:09.830 --> 01:35:11.110
We should find some food
while we're here.

01:35:11.210 --> 01:35:12.160
No. We don't have time.

01:35:12.260 --> 01:35:14.460
Listen, none of us are gonna survive
much longer without food, okay?

01:35:14.560 --> 01:35:15.560
Including Laura.

01:35:17.630 --> 01:35:18.630
Okay.

01:35:23.790 --> 01:35:26.390
- Sam, over here.
- What?

01:35:26.950 --> 01:35:28.150
Bingo.

01:35:39.710 --> 01:35:40.910
Brian?

01:35:42.030 --> 01:35:44.750
- I'm okay.
- What happened?

01:35:45.750 --> 01:35:47.740
All I did was open up
the cupboard.

01:35:48.270 --> 01:35:51.110
- Well, we can use it.
- Put food in it.

01:35:54.210 --> 01:35:55.210
Run!

01:36:04.070 --> 01:36:06.030
Pull him in, Brian!

01:36:08.590 --> 01:36:11.950
- You all right?
- Oh, my god, there's more.

01:36:14.150 --> 01:36:15.550
My leg.

01:36:19.790 --> 01:36:21.710
Here, use this.

01:36:29.310 --> 01:36:31.310
It should be over
New York by now.

01:36:32.150 --> 01:36:33.340
Satellite readings are showing

01:36:33.440 --> 01:36:35.890
a temperature drop of
10 degrees per second.

01:36:52.270 --> 01:36:53.670
You guys...

01:36:53.830 --> 01:36:55.910
I think we're in the eye of it.

01:36:57.030 --> 01:36:58.870
We gotta get back right now.

01:36:59.770 --> 01:37:02.140
Look, I'm gonna go outside,

01:37:02.240 --> 01:37:04.090
and I'm gonna lure
the wolves out of the room.

01:37:04.550 --> 01:37:06.910
When they leave,
you lock the door.

01:37:07.470 --> 01:37:08.710
Good luck.

01:38:14.670 --> 01:38:17.270
- Brian, hurry.
- I need something.

01:38:18.030 --> 01:38:19.950
Come on, hurry!

01:38:29.750 --> 01:38:31.870
Brian! Brian, open the door!

01:38:36.670 --> 01:38:38.550
We have to get out of here now.

01:38:38.710 --> 01:38:40.870
Brian, get the supplies.

01:39:38.350 --> 01:39:39.990
Let's go!

01:39:40.870 --> 01:39:41.910
Pull, Brian!

01:40:18.150 --> 01:40:20.230
Take the medicine to Laura.

01:40:51.750 --> 01:40:54.670
We're almost there.
Come on!

01:40:55.750 --> 01:40:58.630
Brian! Close the door!

01:41:09.830 --> 01:41:12.150
Don't let the fire go out!

01:41:12.310 --> 01:41:14.070
What's happening?

01:41:21.790 --> 01:41:23.510
Buddha,
come away from the door.

01:41:23.670 --> 01:41:25.150
Come, Buddha, come!

01:41:26.030 --> 01:41:28.630
More books! More books!

01:42:22.270 --> 01:42:24.430
How long have I been
out of it?

01:42:25.550 --> 01:42:27.270
Couple hours.

01:42:27.430 --> 01:42:28.950
How do you feel?

01:42:29.150 --> 01:42:31.990
Okay. What happened?

01:42:32.150 --> 01:42:33.780
Well, we had to get inside
in kind of a hurry,

01:42:33.880 --> 01:42:36.690
so I, uh... sort of pushed you in.

01:42:37.990 --> 01:42:40.070
I should be used to you
pushing me around.

01:42:41.590 --> 01:42:43.550
Good to have you back.

01:42:48.870 --> 01:42:50.550
What are you doing?

01:42:51.710 --> 01:42:53.460
The eye of the storm
has passed,

01:42:53.760 --> 01:42:55.940
and we're 40 miles
from Manhattan.

01:42:56.040 --> 01:42:57.750
Jack, shouldn't we wait
one more day?

01:43:00.550 --> 01:43:03.150
Sam may not have one more day.

01:44:15.190 --> 01:44:17.710
What do you think's gonna
happen to us?

01:44:18.110 --> 01:44:19.910
What do you mean?

01:44:21.190 --> 01:44:25.710
I mean us. Civilization.
Everybody.

01:44:27.870 --> 01:44:30.990
Mankind survived the last Ice Age.

01:44:31.150 --> 01:44:34.430
We're certainly capable
of surviving this one.

01:44:35.750 --> 01:44:39.230
All depends on whether or not
we're able to learn from our mistakes.

01:44:41.830 --> 01:44:45.110
I sure as hell would like
a chance to learn from mine.

01:44:46.230 --> 01:44:48.550
You did everything you could.

01:44:51.630 --> 01:44:53.710
I was thinking about Sam.

01:44:59.670 --> 01:45:02.630
Jack, you know the
chances of Sam...

01:45:14.190 --> 01:45:16.670
I made my son a promise.

01:45:17.910 --> 01:45:19.830
I'm going to keep it.

01:45:43.430 --> 01:45:46.390
<i>Parker, this is Houston.
Do you read?</i>

01:45:46.550 --> 01:45:48.550
Roger, mission control.
Go ahead.

01:45:48.710 --> 01:45:50.100
<i>We're getting scattered reports</i>

01:45:50.200 --> 01:45:52.850
<i>that the storm is dissipating
over North America.</i>

01:45:53.030 --> 01:45:54.950
<i>Can you confirm?</i>

01:45:56.310 --> 01:45:59.870
Affirmative. It's finally clearing.

01:46:00.470 --> 01:46:01.970
We're over Europe right now.

01:46:02.070 --> 01:46:05.350
I can see landmass
for the first time in days.

01:47:55.590 --> 01:47:58.070
How much further is it
to the library?

01:47:58.230 --> 01:48:00.070
It should be...

01:48:02.870 --> 01:48:04.670
right here.

01:48:08.950 --> 01:48:10.990
I'm sorry, Jack.

01:48:48.750 --> 01:48:49.750
Sam?

01:49:59.790 --> 01:50:01.350
Who is that?

01:50:07.270 --> 01:50:09.150
My father.

01:50:13.990 --> 01:50:15.390
You made it.

01:50:19.830 --> 01:50:21.710
Of course I did.

01:51:12.670 --> 01:51:14.590
Mr. President.

01:51:16.630 --> 01:51:19.990
I've just received a shortwave
radio transmission from Jack Hall.

01:51:20.190 --> 01:51:22.190
He made it to New York.

01:51:22.910 --> 01:51:24.750
He says there are survivors.

01:51:26.550 --> 01:51:28.270
Thank you, Tom.

01:51:29.310 --> 01:51:30.870
That's...

01:51:31.910 --> 01:51:33.670
That's good news.

01:51:43.110 --> 01:51:48.190
<i>These past few weeks have left us all
with a profound sense of humility</i>

01:51:48.390 --> 01:51:51.630
<i>in the face of nature's
destructive power.</i>

01:51:51.790 --> 01:51:55.510
<i>For years, we operated under
the belief that we could continue</i>

01:51:55.670 --> 01:52:01.310
<i>consuming our planet's natural
resources without consequence.</i>

01:52:02.270 --> 01:52:03.950
<i>We were wrong.</i>

01:52:05.430 --> 01:52:07.230
<i>I was wrong.</i>

01:52:08.190 --> 01:52:09.870
<i>The fact that my first
address to you</i>

01:52:09.970 --> 01:52:12.240
<i>comes from a consulate
on foreign soil</i>

01:52:12.750 --> 01:52:16.110
<i>is a testament to our
changed reality.</i>

01:52:16.430 --> 01:52:18.190
<i>Not only Americans</i>

01:52:18.470 --> 01:52:21.910
<i>but people all around the globe
are now guests in the nations</i>

01:52:22.070 --> 01:52:24.870
<i>we once called
The Third World.</i>

01:52:25.030 --> 01:52:29.350
<i>In our time of need, they have
taken us in and sheltered us.</i>

01:52:29.990 --> 01:52:33.590
<i>And I am deeply grateful
for their hospitality.</i>

01:52:55.150 --> 01:52:57.220
<i>We mourn the loss of
a spirited leader</i>

01:52:57.320 --> 01:52:59.130
<i>whose courageous order
to evacuate...</i>

01:52:59.230 --> 01:53:04.190
Peter? Hey.
You feeling okay today?

01:53:04.350 --> 01:53:07.340
<i>For days, we've despaired
about the fate of the people</i>

01:53:07.440 --> 01:53:09.750
<i>who are trapped in the North.</i>

01:53:09.910 --> 01:53:13.430
<i>Today, there is cause for hope.</i>

01:53:14.510 --> 01:53:15.780
<i>Only a few hours ago,</i>

01:53:15.880 --> 01:53:20.030
<i>I received word that a small group
of people survived in New York City</i>

01:53:20.330 --> 01:53:23.960
<i>against all odds and in the face
of tremendous adversity.</i>

01:53:24.670 --> 01:53:27.090
<i>I've ordered an immediate
search-and-rescue mission</i>

01:53:27.190 --> 01:53:31.430
<i>to bring them home and
to look for more survivors.</i>

01:54:02.270 --> 01:54:03.270
Jack!

01:54:04.230 --> 01:54:07.710
It's good to see you.
Come on, let's go get on board.

01:55:03.070 --> 01:55:05.030
Look at that.

01:55:05.350 --> 01:55:06.350
What?

01:55:07.950 --> 01:55:10.950
Have you ever seen
the air so clear?

01:55:11.305 --> 01:55:17.641
