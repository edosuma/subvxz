10:04.739 --> 10:07.841
At least I landed
in this nice soft...

10:07.908 --> 10:08.942
Field of poison ivy.

10:09.009 --> 10:12.480
(GRUNTS) Well, mash me taters.

10:12.546 --> 10:14.449
Enough is enough, rabbit.

10:14.516 --> 10:19.053
No more banjo, no more
clovers, no more kicking,
and no more malarkey!

10:19.120 --> 10:23.357
You will give me both feet,
and you'll do it now!

10:23.424 --> 10:24.926
-Say "please."
-Please!

10:24.993 --> 10:27.961
You got it, doc!
Both feet, coming right up.

10:28.028 --> 10:29.029
One, two.

10:29.096 --> 10:33.667
LEPRECHAUN: Waffle braids!

10:33.733 --> 10:35.436
(GROANS)

10:35.503 --> 10:37.606
Oh, I'm in the soup now.

10:37.673 --> 10:42.673
I can't show me face at
home, that banshee will never
let me hear the end of it...

10:43.010 --> 10:44.679
Hello, dear.

10:44.745 --> 10:46.681
-No, no, no, no.
I wasn't talking about you.
-(GROWLING)

10:46.747 --> 10:49.116
There's no need to open
your mouth, sweety, I was...

10:49.183 --> 10:53.220
-(BANSHEE SCREECHING)
-Ahhh! No!

10:53.287 --> 10:55.655
Some guys have all the luck.

10:55.722 --> 10:56.756
(BANJO PLAYING)
