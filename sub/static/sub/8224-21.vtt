WEBVTT

00:00.040 --> 00:02.510
Do not try what you about to see at home.

00:02.520 --> 00:04.960
We're what you call experts.

00:07.010 --> 00:08.720
On this episode of "Mythbusters,"

00:10.280 --> 00:11.890
You're in charge.

00:11.900 --> 00:15.260
The team randomly selects stories from the mailbox

00:15.260 --> 00:16.740
and gives them a whirl.

00:16.740 --> 00:19.450
You asked are our hollywood gun-handling techniques

00:19.450 --> 00:22.240
effective or just for show?

00:23.380 --> 00:24.960
Nice, gangster.

00:24.960 --> 00:25.910
Your next request

00:25.990 --> 00:29.400
is to test a ballistic myth sent in by the troops.

00:30.060 --> 00:31.780
Then there's the internet craze 

00:31.820 --> 00:34.550
for crazy roadside assistance.

00:34.790 --> 00:37.240
Like a really dangerous way to fill a tire.

00:37.410 --> 00:40.950
And the final lucky dip in this eclectic mix of myth...

00:40.950 --> 00:42.580
Pick a door.

00:42.710 --> 00:45.970
is a mathematical paradox from a game show.

00:45.970 --> 00:46.970
We have a winner.

00:50.680 --> 00:52.860
Who are the mythbusters?

00:53.690 --> 00:54.520
Adam Savage...

00:54.520 --> 00:56.790
I reject your reality and substitute my own.

00:56.790 --> 00:58.270
And Jamie Hyneman.

00:58.270 --> 00:59.910
We'll have an adventure.

01:00.100 --> 01:04.519
Between them, more than 30 years of special-effects experience.

01:04.540 --> 01:06.220
Together with Tory Belleci.

01:06.220 --> 01:07.580
I'm gonna die!

01:07.580 --> 01:08.510
Grant Imahara.

01:08.510 --> 01:10.380
This is the most dangerous thing we gonna do all week.

01:10.380 --> 01:12.020
And Kari Byron.

01:12.440 --> 01:13.550
Let's do it.

01:13.550 --> 01:15.770
They don't just tell the myths.

01:16.710 --> 01:19.100
They put them to the test.

01:25.310 --> 01:27.090
Step right up, step right up 

01:27.100 --> 01:29.910
for a viewer request extravaganza.

01:30.950 --> 01:31.730
What's this about?

01:31.730 --> 01:34.630
Ah, this is the wheel of mythfortune.

01:35.120 --> 01:37.600
In each one of these boxes is a suggestion

01:37.600 --> 01:39.470
from a fan for a story we should do.

01:39.500 --> 01:40.630
Give it a spin.

01:47.030 --> 01:48.130
Dear mythbusters, 

01:48.130 --> 01:50.540
can you please test the Monty Hall paradox 

01:54.320 --> 01:55.760
I know you're a big fan of game shows.

01:55.760 --> 01:58.040
But let me remind you what this one is.

01:58.040 --> 02:01.200
Monty Hall offers a contestant one of three doors, 

02:01.260 --> 02:02.620
says there's a prize behind one.

02:02.620 --> 02:05.090
The contestant chooses, say, Door B.

02:05.090 --> 02:06.870
Before he gets to see if there's a prize, 

02:06.960 --> 02:08.470
Monty opens up Door A

02:08.470 --> 02:10.720
and shows him that there's nothing behind it.

02:10.720 --> 02:13.930
Monty then offers the contestant a chance to switch

02:13.940 --> 02:17.150
from his original Door B to the remaining Door C.

02:17.160 --> 02:19.220
The question is-- should you switch?

02:19.220 --> 02:20.830
This is interesting for two reasons.

02:20.830 --> 02:22.750
One is that apparently psychologically 

02:22.750 --> 02:25.230
people do not want to switch from their original choice.

02:25.230 --> 02:28.250
Two is, apparently they will win more often 

02:28.260 --> 02:29.540
if they do switch.

02:30.080 --> 02:32.100
Well, I'm not sure why that would be the case.

02:32.100 --> 02:34.000
But let's test it.

02:34.690 --> 02:37.820
It's unusual that a complex mathematical paradox

02:37.820 --> 02:40.170
is named after a game show host.

02:40.240 --> 02:42.940
But this counterintuitive problem has puzzled

02:42.950 --> 02:44.850
number-crunchers for years.

02:45.160 --> 02:47.090
After a door selection is made,

02:47.090 --> 02:50.460
the host always opens one of the remaining two doors 

02:50.600 --> 02:52.260
and then gives the contestant a chance 

02:52.260 --> 02:54.580
to stick with their original choice

02:55.340 --> 02:58.370
or switch to the other unopened door.

02:58.800 --> 03:00.810
Which leaves us with a two-part myth.

03:00.810 --> 03:04.660
Supposedly people overwhelmingly decide to stick,

03:04.660 --> 03:07.470
and apparently it's better to switch.

03:08.310 --> 03:09.710
So how do you want to go about this?

03:10.090 --> 03:10.710
As far as I can see, 

03:10.710 --> 03:12.010
there are two parts to the story--

03:12.010 --> 03:14.250
One psychological and one statistical.

03:14.250 --> 03:16.060
The psychological being that people do not want to switch

03:16.060 --> 03:17.400
from the original choice.

03:17.400 --> 03:18.620
The statistical being

03:18.620 --> 03:21.330
that there is an advantage to them if they do.

03:21.540 --> 03:23.320
Let's start with the psychological then.

03:23.320 --> 03:24.160
Perfect.

03:24.160 --> 03:26.310
Let the games begin.

03:26.310 --> 03:28.430
If we're gonna test this out on the general public, 

03:28.580 --> 03:31.280
we should get a bunch of people, say 20 or so.

03:31.280 --> 03:32.920
20 sounds like a good number.

03:32.920 --> 03:34.220
How do you want to run them through it?

03:34.220 --> 03:37.170
We could do it with, say, a deck of cards.

03:37.170 --> 03:38.850
I feel like that's missing something 

03:38.860 --> 03:40.500
essential to a game show experience 

03:40.500 --> 03:43.010
that may influence people's decisionmaking.

03:43.010 --> 03:44.440
I'm thinking a real stage 

03:44.440 --> 03:45.400
and some real doors 

03:45.400 --> 03:48.400
and set up a "Mythbusters" game show scenario.

03:48.400 --> 03:49.750
That looks great.

03:50.180 --> 03:52.440
And with their pre-made props in tow, 

03:52.440 --> 03:56.300
the team begin at a local theater.

03:56.730 --> 03:58.780
Ladies and gentlem, door number one.

03:59.630 --> 04:01.820
Where they prepare their game show setting, 

04:01.820 --> 04:06.240
which includes the obligatory over-the-top game show host outfit.

04:08.750 --> 04:10.590
Maybe you should try door number three.

04:15.850 --> 04:16.670
Much better.

04:16.670 --> 04:18.000
Now should we start?

04:18.040 --> 04:18.810
Yep.

04:18.810 --> 04:20.769
With Adam dressed for the test, 

04:20.769 --> 04:23.370
let's find out exactly what the test is.

04:23.370 --> 04:25.210
We've gotten 20 volunteers,

04:25.210 --> 04:27.980
and the door behind which the prize has been placed

04:27.980 --> 04:31.750
will be determined by a computer-generated randomizer.

04:36.550 --> 04:38.250
The psychology of this myth

04:38.250 --> 04:40.510
is what we're investigating with this test.

04:40.510 --> 04:42.050
It is stated that most people 

04:42.050 --> 04:46.240
if given the choice to switch their door will not do it.

04:46.250 --> 04:47.940
Hello, sir.

04:47.940 --> 04:48.980
We want to find out if that's true.

04:48.980 --> 04:50.550
We'll bring in a bunch of contestants, 

04:50.550 --> 04:51.960
run them through whole the test.

04:51.960 --> 04:53.490
But what we're looking for is to see

04:53.490 --> 04:55.690
how many stick with their original choice 

04:55.690 --> 04:57.060
and how many switch.

04:58.220 --> 05:00.570
Pick a door.

05:02.040 --> 05:04.570
We are playing a game called "Pick a door."

05:04.570 --> 05:05.210
Okay.

05:05.210 --> 05:06.500
I would like to start 

05:06.500 --> 05:09.370
by you telling me which door is your choice.

05:09.900 --> 05:11.420
I will take number one.

05:11.420 --> 05:11.940
Number one.

05:11.940 --> 05:13.290
- Door number one is your choice. - Yeah.

05:13.290 --> 05:15.750
Jamie, will you please show Brian

05:15.800 --> 05:17.420
what's behind door number three.

05:19.940 --> 05:20.760
Nothing.

05:20.760 --> 05:21.370
As you can see 

05:21.370 --> 05:23.170
there's nothing behind door number three.

05:23.170 --> 05:24.400
Those of you playing at home,

05:24.400 --> 05:26.620
there's an important fact you should know which is that

05:26.620 --> 05:29.370
whenever I open an empty door for the contestant, 

05:29.380 --> 05:30.710
I know where the prize is, 

05:30.740 --> 05:33.520
and I'm showing them an minute door on purpose.

05:33.540 --> 05:36.250
Your prize is either behind door number one,

05:36.250 --> 05:38.270
your original choice, or door number two.

05:38.430 --> 05:39.810
I'll give you a last chance.

05:39.810 --> 05:42.040
You can switch right now to door number two, if you like,

05:42.040 --> 05:44.160
or you can stick with your original choice.

05:44.160 --> 05:46.200
And so to the moment of truth.

05:46.200 --> 05:48.230
As per the first part of the myth,

05:48.230 --> 05:51.670
will he stick or take the opportunity to switch?

05:52.530 --> 05:53.990
I will stick with my door number one.

05:53.990 --> 05:55.170
You will stick.

05:55.320 --> 05:56.470
How come?

05:56.780 --> 05:58.130
Because it was my first instinct.

05:58.130 --> 06:00.820
There is, contestant number one sticks.

06:00.820 --> 06:03.320
Adam and Jamie have their first data point.

06:03.320 --> 06:04.290
Jamie, will you show brian

06:04.290 --> 06:05.830
what's behind door number one.

06:07.010 --> 06:08.160
Nothing.

06:09.160 --> 06:10.580
Sorry, there's nothing behind door number one.

06:10.580 --> 06:11.540
Thank you very much for playing.

06:11.540 --> 06:12.840
That's an excellent data point. Thank you.

06:12.840 --> 06:14.680
- Have a good day!  - Thank you.

06:15.230 --> 06:17.090
With no preknowledge of the test, 

06:17.090 --> 06:19.550
from backstage the next contestant steps up.

06:19.550 --> 06:20.430
How are you?

06:20.430 --> 06:22.200
After picking her door-

06:22.320 --> 06:24.380
Which door is your choice?

06:24.460 --> 06:25.070
One.

06:25.070 --> 06:27.090
Jamie opens the losing door,

06:27.090 --> 06:30.510
and Adam moves the test along to the relevant data point.

06:30.640 --> 06:32.080
You can switch to door number three

06:32.080 --> 06:33.810
or you can stick to your original choice.

06:33.810 --> 06:35.840
What's it gonna be? Are you going to switch or stick?

06:35.840 --> 06:36.530
I'm sticking.

06:36.530 --> 06:37.500
You are sticking.

06:37.500 --> 06:38.200
How come?

06:38.200 --> 06:39.500
Because the door is pink.

06:39.500 --> 06:40.500
Okay.

06:40.500 --> 06:42.490
This time sticking pays off.

06:42.740 --> 06:43.550
We have a winner.

06:43.550 --> 06:45.920
It's a winner. Congratulations.

06:45.920 --> 06:48.600
Remember, the win/lose result is irrelevant

06:48.600 --> 06:50.180
in part one of the myth.

06:50.180 --> 06:51.570
We're testing

06:51.570 --> 06:53.420
the psychology of the decision making.

06:53.420 --> 06:55.310
Is it true that the contestants

06:55.310 --> 06:57.910
will predominantly choose to stick?

06:57.960 --> 06:58.470
Nothing.

06:58.470 --> 07:00.070
I'd like to offer you one last chance

07:00.070 --> 07:02.200
to perhaps switch your choice to door number three

07:02.200 --> 07:04.440
or stick with your original choice.

07:04.900 --> 07:05.560
I'll stick with one.

07:05.570 --> 07:06.250
You really want to stick?

07:06.250 --> 07:07.220
How come?

07:07.220 --> 07:08.070
Gut feeling.

07:08.070 --> 07:09.150
Gut feeling.

07:09.150 --> 07:10.940
That's three from three.

07:11.010 --> 07:12.310
I'm sorry.

07:13.260 --> 07:14.940
And as the 100% record

07:14.940 --> 07:17.190
in favor of the myth continues-

07:17.450 --> 07:18.620
I'm going to go with number one.

07:18.620 --> 07:20.960
things start to get really interesting.

07:20.960 --> 07:21.690
I'm going to stick with number two.

07:21.690 --> 07:23.450
You are going to stick with number two.

07:23.450 --> 07:24.710
Is there a reason behind your wanting to stick?

07:24.710 --> 07:26.090
First choice.

07:26.330 --> 07:27.880
Because it's not just the score

07:27.880 --> 07:29.390
that's providing a pattern.

07:29.390 --> 07:30.680
I'm going to stick with two.

07:30.680 --> 07:31.440
Sticking with three.

07:31.440 --> 07:32.480
I'd like to stick with my original.

07:32.480 --> 07:33.060
You are gonna stick.

07:33.060 --> 07:34.010
But the motivation

07:34.010 --> 07:36.490
for sticking is becoming clearer.

07:36.490 --> 07:37.570
I'm going to stick.

07:37.570 --> 07:38.960
You are gonna to stick, how come?

07:38.960 --> 07:40.850
I guess it's a 50/50 chance.

07:41.130 --> 07:43.500
The perception is with two doors left

07:43.500 --> 07:45.710
there's a 50/50 chance of winning,

07:45.910 --> 07:49.800
and so there's seemingly no advantage to switching.

07:50.030 --> 07:50.980
You know what, I trust my instincts.

07:50.980 --> 07:52.460
I'm going to stay with door number two.

07:52.460 --> 07:57.010
And incredibly, as every contestant decides to stick-

07:57.010 --> 07:58.040
I'm going to stay with three.

07:58.040 --> 08:00.680
Part one of the myth is looking great.

08:00.990 --> 08:02.340
Dude, this is so cool.

08:02.340 --> 08:05.110
They are all of them sticking with their original choice.

08:05.110 --> 08:05.870
I know.

08:05.870 --> 08:07.450
That is so cool.

08:07.460 --> 08:09.300
I would not have called that.

08:09.750 --> 08:10.810
Stick with number one.

08:10.810 --> 08:12.920
And to fully decipher the results,

08:12.920 --> 08:13.580
I'm going to stick.

08:13.580 --> 08:16.600
Adam and Jamie roll their game show credits.

08:18.200 --> 08:18.910
Fantastic.

08:18.910 --> 08:20.230
Congratulations. Thank you.

08:20.230 --> 08:20.980
Nicely done.

08:20.980 --> 08:21.690
Thank you very much for playing.

08:21.690 --> 08:23.560
And head back to the shop.

08:27.730 --> 08:29.300
Wheel of mythfortune.

08:29.310 --> 08:30.380
Shall I give it a spin?

08:30.380 --> 08:31.860
- Please. - Go for it.

08:35.870 --> 08:37.120
What does it say?

08:37.860 --> 08:40.220
This letter comes from a U.S. soldier.

08:40.220 --> 08:41.570
He writes, "Dear mythbusters,

08:41.570 --> 08:43.450
if a hand grenade lands next to you,

08:43.450 --> 08:45.030
is it better to hit the ground

08:45.030 --> 08:47.330
because shrapnel will go up and out?"

08:47.330 --> 08:49.260
Okay, if it goes up and out,

08:49.260 --> 08:51.330
it might create a safe zone down below.

08:52.330 --> 08:54.640
Raised by a brave friend in the military,

08:54.640 --> 08:56.890
it's an interesting ballistics question.

08:56.890 --> 08:58.370
Is the lethal fragment pattern

08:58.370 --> 09:01.410
of a grenade really up and away?

09:01.430 --> 09:04.140
Can you actually avoid shrapnel damage

09:04.140 --> 09:05.980
by hitting the deck?

09:06.730 --> 09:08.550
There's two things lethal about a grenade.

09:08.550 --> 09:10.500
The shockwave and shrapnel.

09:10.500 --> 09:11.560
All right. What are we gonna do this?

09:11.570 --> 09:12.560
Let's go to the bomb range,

09:12.570 --> 09:13.950
set off some hand grenades,

09:13.950 --> 09:15.870
and find out at what point

09:15.870 --> 09:17.150
the shockwave is no longer lethal.

09:17.150 --> 09:19.530
At that distance you'd be safe.

09:19.530 --> 09:21.620
And then, all you'd have to worry about is shrapnel.

09:21.620 --> 09:23.100
We'll build something to catch all the shrapnel

09:23.100 --> 09:25.270
at that distance and see what we get.

09:27.790 --> 09:28.750
To kick things off,

09:28.750 --> 09:31.140
the guys hit their favorite location.

09:32.110 --> 09:34.430
We've come to the Alameda county sheriff's bomb range 

09:34.430 --> 09:37.220
to test the myth that if a grenade is going off

09:37.220 --> 09:39.790
and you hit the deck and lay flat on the ground,

09:39.790 --> 09:41.410
you will get no shrapnel.

09:41.410 --> 09:43.220
But, before get the shrapnel,

09:43.220 --> 09:45.770
we need to establish the blast wave perimeter.

09:45.770 --> 09:47.110
Because inside of that,

09:47.110 --> 09:49.070
shrapnel or not, you'd be dead.

09:49.070 --> 09:52.050
To do that we'll use our oseco burst disc,

09:52.050 --> 09:54.450
set to 75 psi,

09:54.450 --> 09:56.290
which is the threshold of certain death.

09:56.440 --> 09:58.000
We'll have ten burst discs

09:58.000 --> 09:58.890
starting at a foot to ten feet

09:58.890 --> 10:01.400
all the way out from the blast.

10:01.400 --> 10:03.640
This will record the lethality

10:03.640 --> 10:05.760
of the blast from the grenade.

10:05.880 --> 10:07.900
We've viewed these in the past,

10:07.900 --> 10:09.170
"Knock Your Socks Off",

10:09.170 --> 10:10.900
and "What's Blast-proof".

10:11.490 --> 10:14.190
It's going to give you the data we need.

10:14.860 --> 10:16.340
Here's the last one.

10:16.790 --> 10:18.240
Sensors are set.

10:18.240 --> 10:20.560
Remember, this first detonation is designed

10:20.560 --> 10:23.190
to determine how far the lethal perimeter

10:23.190 --> 10:24.950
of the shockwave it stands.

10:24.950 --> 10:28.360
Later, the team will use that minimum survival distance

10:28.360 --> 10:30.250
as the point at which they measure

10:30.250 --> 10:32.530
the height of the shrapnel distribution.

10:32.530 --> 10:35.650
For now it's all about the shockwave,

10:35.650 --> 10:38.760
which means they're ready to pull the pin, right?

10:38.990 --> 10:40.150
Wrong.

10:40.420 --> 10:43.090
Because pulling a pin from a grenade can be somewhat dangerous,

10:43.150 --> 10:44.460
we're having J.D. set it up

10:44.460 --> 10:46.310
so we can fire remotely from the bunker.

10:46.460 --> 10:48.890
So while the team hunker down in the bunker,

10:48.890 --> 10:51.980
sergeant J.D.Nelson takes a decommissioned grenade

10:52.020 --> 10:55.020
and rigs it with an equivalent amount of high explosive,

10:55.020 --> 10:58.670
a blasting cap, and a remote-control detonator.

10:58.670 --> 11:01.510
And that definitely means it's boom time.

11:01.510 --> 11:02.850
All right, you guys ready?

11:02.860 --> 11:03.910
Let's do this.

11:03.910 --> 11:07.020
All right, this is testing the blast wave of a hand grenade.

11:07.020 --> 11:08.150
This is the first time

11:08.150 --> 11:10.320
I've ever seen a hand grenade go off this closely.

11:10.320 --> 11:11.430
Me, too.

11:11.430 --> 11:12.540
Here we go.

11:12.540 --> 11:16.390
In three, two, one, fire.

11:20.300 --> 11:21.600
That was awesome.

11:21.600 --> 11:22.680
- All right. - Energetic.

11:22.680 --> 11:23.520
Let's check it out.

11:23.520 --> 11:24.290
What they're checking is

11:24.290 --> 11:26.800
how many of the burst discs burst

11:26.820 --> 11:29.610
and crucially which ones survive.

11:29.610 --> 11:31.280
One, two, three, four, five.

11:31.280 --> 11:32.690
Five-foot radius.

11:32.690 --> 11:35.750
That is our blast zone for our grenade.

11:35.750 --> 11:38.870
We set off our grenade and got some good results.

11:38.900 --> 11:41.150
First disc at five feet away ruptured.

11:41.150 --> 11:42.800
The one at six feet didn't,

11:42.800 --> 11:44.080
meaning at five feet

11:44.080 --> 11:45.930
the shockwave alone would kill you.

11:45.930 --> 11:48.130
But at six feet, you'd survive.

11:48.130 --> 11:50.540
So we're gonna set up our shrapnel catchers

11:50.540 --> 11:52.740
just outside that five-foot radius 

11:52.740 --> 11:55.920
and find out exactly what the fragment pattern is.

11:56.530 --> 11:57.840
OK, let's go get the shrapnel catchers.

11:57.840 --> 11:58.360
Perfect.

11:58.360 --> 12:01.150
It's time to bring out the shrapnel catchers.

12:01.160 --> 12:03.920
The idea of this test is to determine exactly 

12:03.920 --> 12:06.450
how high the fragments hit.

12:06.450 --> 12:09.380
Okay, just outside of five feet.

12:09.380 --> 12:10.900
If there's a zone near the ground

12:10.900 --> 12:12.500
that is free from damage,

12:12.500 --> 12:14.610
then the myth will be confirmed.

12:14.620 --> 12:16.420
And from what he's already seen,

12:16.420 --> 12:18.160
Grant is optimistic.

12:18.720 --> 12:20.000
So if you look at the high-speed footage,

12:20.000 --> 12:22.370
it's looking really good for this myth.

12:23.490 --> 12:25.530
You see the blast wave propagating.

12:25.530 --> 12:28.010
If you're outside of that lethal five-foot radius,

12:28.010 --> 12:29.210
you're safe from that.

12:29.210 --> 12:31.180
What we are interested is the shrapnel

12:31.180 --> 12:33.140
which is all total sparkly bits,

12:33.140 --> 12:36.380
and you see that going up and out.

12:36.380 --> 12:37.930
And the important thing for us

12:37.930 --> 12:40.030
is what happens if you're close to the ground.

12:40.030 --> 12:42.830
How much of that shrapnel will actually hit you?

12:43.020 --> 12:45.720
Coming up, Adam and Jamie butt heads-

12:45.720 --> 12:47.580
Adam's going to kick my butt.

12:47.740 --> 12:50.470
in order to crunch the Monty Hall numbers.

12:50.470 --> 12:52.050
In your face!

12:54.000 --> 13:00.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

13:01.150 --> 13:03.190
What do you get when you cross a complex

13:03.190 --> 13:06.030
probability puzzle with a game show?

13:06.570 --> 13:08.860
The answer is the viewer-requested myth

13:08.860 --> 13:11.960
known as the Monty Hall paradox.

13:13.140 --> 13:14.600
And so far-

13:15.430 --> 13:18.480
Adam and Jamie have answered part one of the problem.

13:18.480 --> 13:19.150
What's it gonna be?

13:19.150 --> 13:21.200
Are you going to switch or stick?

13:21.200 --> 13:23.400
As far as the psychology of sticking

13:23.400 --> 13:24.770
or switching goes-

13:24.770 --> 13:25.890
I'm going to stick with two.

13:25.890 --> 13:29.260
Contestants are unwilling to change their choice.

13:29.260 --> 13:30.510
I'm going to stick.

13:32.100 --> 13:33.420
Where do we stand?

13:33.570 --> 13:35.150
Well, amazingly, our volunteers

13:35.150 --> 13:38.310
chose to stick 100% of the time.

13:38.310 --> 13:39.200
The second part states that

13:39.200 --> 13:41.650
we should see clear statistical advantage to switching.

13:41.650 --> 13:43.810
Did we see anything like that in the numbers?

13:43.840 --> 13:45.750
Well, given that nobody decided to switch,

13:45.750 --> 13:46.740
we don't really know.

13:46.740 --> 13:48.930
Clearly we should run this again.

13:48.990 --> 13:50.800
And I think with an equal number

13:50.800 --> 13:53.730
of switching iterations to sticking iterations,

13:53.730 --> 13:55.510
so we can really compare the numbers.

13:56.620 --> 13:57.740
As Jamie said,

13:57.740 --> 13:59.590
with all of the contestants sticking,

13:59.590 --> 14:01.250
they don't yet have any data

14:01.250 --> 14:04.050
on whether switching is advantageous.

14:05.200 --> 14:09.230
So test two will focus on the statistical paradox.

14:09.230 --> 14:13.070
Is switching in what appears to be a 50/50 situation

14:13.170 --> 14:14.890
really your best bet?

14:14.900 --> 14:17.760
To find out, Adam and Jamie will collect a large 

14:17.760 --> 14:22.010
and definitive sample of 100 data points

14:22.300 --> 14:26.170
with an elegant, mechanical, mini game show set up.

14:26.500 --> 14:27.460
So what I need to do right now

14:27.460 --> 14:32.130
is build a physical Monty Hall paradox testing simulator.

14:32.130 --> 14:33.090
And it's a machine- 

14:33.100 --> 14:34.440
I need to think of it like a machine

14:34.440 --> 14:36.210
because there's a lot of moving parts.

14:36.210 --> 14:38.630
I'm thinking it's going to have two sets of three doors.

14:38.630 --> 14:39.780
One for me, one for Jamie.

14:39.790 --> 14:42.860
It's gonna have a row of 50 tests randomly selected.

14:42.860 --> 14:46.040
Preloaded so that we can cycle through it really fast.

14:46.300 --> 14:47.430
It's not going to be a simple build, 

14:47.430 --> 14:49.740
but I think in the end it's going to be really cool.

14:50.030 --> 14:51.600
All right, let's bring it on in.

14:52.290 --> 14:54.170
This rig serves a couple of functions.

14:54.170 --> 14:56.150
First, it increases our sample size

14:56.150 --> 14:58.720
which in turn increases our accuracy.

14:58.720 --> 15:01.350
Secondly, it removes the variable of choice

15:01.350 --> 15:03.950
from the equation and puts both switching

15:03.960 --> 15:06.530
and sticking on an even playing field.

15:06.530 --> 15:09.140
We'll show you how you would fare over time

15:09.340 --> 15:10.950
with either choice.

15:11.170 --> 15:12.370
So this all looks lovely,

15:12.370 --> 15:14.540
but how does it work?

15:14.540 --> 15:16.390
You and I are going to run through each of the tests.

15:16.390 --> 15:18.350
And each time we win,

15:18.380 --> 15:19.440
we take a red piece of paper

15:19.440 --> 15:22.410
and we thumb tag it up onto the board behind us.

15:22.910 --> 15:25.340
At the end, we should be able to see visually 

15:25.340 --> 15:26.220
if there's a difference 

15:26.230 --> 15:28.690
between me always switching and you never switching,

15:28.700 --> 15:31.290
and we should be able to count and compare the numbers.

15:31.300 --> 15:32.700
How do I think I'll do?

15:32.700 --> 15:35.090
Well, if the myth is true,

15:35.390 --> 15:37.210
Adam's going to kick my butt.

15:37.850 --> 15:41.420
To find out, it's "Pick a door" -- Take two.

15:41.420 --> 15:42.040
Test number one-

15:42.040 --> 15:43.330
choose your door.

15:43.410 --> 15:44.200
I choose one.

15:44.200 --> 15:45.350
I choose door number two.

15:45.350 --> 15:47.050
Open an empty door.

15:47.810 --> 15:48.930
I'm sticking.

15:48.930 --> 15:49.800
I lose.

15:49.800 --> 15:51.290
I am switching.

15:51.380 --> 15:52.740
I win.

15:53.190 --> 15:54.480
Unlike the previous test-

15:54.490 --> 15:55.120
I choose one.

15:55.130 --> 15:56.310
I choose three.

15:56.310 --> 16:00.090
Adam and Jamie are only focusing on the win/lose result.

16:00.090 --> 16:02.400
I am sticking, I lose.

16:02.400 --> 16:04.710
I am switching, I win.

16:05.870 --> 16:08.000
The rules are exactly the same-

16:08.000 --> 16:08.610
Test number three --

16:08.610 --> 16:12.100
except the stick or switch variable is removed.

16:12.100 --> 16:13.360
I'm sticking.

16:13.510 --> 16:15.120
Jamie always sticks-

16:15.170 --> 16:15.800
I lose.

16:15.800 --> 16:17.630
and Adam always switches.

16:17.730 --> 16:18.900
I am switching.

16:18.900 --> 16:19.870
I win!

16:19.880 --> 16:20.600
This is crazy.

16:20.600 --> 16:22.080
I can't keep winning like this.

16:22.090 --> 16:25.270
In addition, the large sample means that over time-

16:25.270 --> 16:26.450
I'm sticking.

16:26.630 --> 16:27.560
I lose.

16:27.560 --> 16:30.090
The results will reflect the true probability

16:30.090 --> 16:32.500
of the choice to stick or switch.

16:33.430 --> 16:34.570
I'm sticking.

16:34.570 --> 16:35.110
I win.

16:36.050 --> 16:38.780
It's not long before the results on the board

16:38.780 --> 16:40.460
paint a definitive picture.

16:40.460 --> 16:41.700
I choose two.

16:41.700 --> 16:43.160
The Monty Hall paradox is interesting

16:43.160 --> 16:46.090
because on the face of it, it seems simple.

16:46.090 --> 16:47.200
I am switching.

16:47.200 --> 16:48.250
I win!

16:48.250 --> 16:49.880
During the final stage,

16:49.880 --> 16:51.590
you've got two choices,

16:51.590 --> 16:53.920
you know one of them's a winner and one of them's not.

16:53.920 --> 16:55.570
So common sense would tell you

16:55.570 --> 16:58.080
that you've got a 50/50 chance of winning.

16:58.080 --> 16:59.620
And yet, you don't.

16:59.690 --> 17:01.920
That's where the paradox comes in.

17:01.920 --> 17:03.100
I am switching.

17:03.100 --> 17:03.850
I win!

17:03.850 --> 17:04.730
Seven in a row.

17:04.730 --> 17:06.099
In your face!

17:06.099 --> 17:08.290
You could talk about the mathematics and statistics

17:08.290 --> 17:10.180
and the theory and the proofs this story

17:10.180 --> 17:11.400
until you're blue in the face.

17:11.400 --> 17:13.869
But the only way to make the numbers truly clear

17:13.869 --> 17:15.160
is just to do it.

17:15.160 --> 17:17.869
And the results are crystal clear.

17:17.869 --> 17:21.010
Switching is far, far better

17:21.160 --> 17:23.140
Than sticking with your original choice.

17:24.030 --> 17:25.970
What's going on is really interesting.

17:25.970 --> 17:27.450
If the prize is equally likely

17:27.450 --> 17:29.290
to be behind each of the doors,

17:29.290 --> 17:31.420
then if a player picks door one,

17:31.420 --> 17:32.320
there's a one this three chance

17:32.320 --> 17:33.980
the prize is behind it.

17:34.040 --> 17:35.990
That means that there's a two in three chance 

17:36.000 --> 17:39.040
that the prize is behind doors two and three.

17:39.540 --> 17:41.190
Now take away door three,

17:41.190 --> 17:42.490
and there's still the two and three chance

17:42.490 --> 17:44.380
that it's behind door two.

17:44.380 --> 17:47.670
So switching effectively doubles your chances of winning.

17:48.100 --> 17:49.830
So what advice can we offer viewers

17:49.950 --> 17:51.600
about the Monty Hall paradox?

17:51.600 --> 17:53.540
Well, clearly if you're ever playing this game, 

17:53.540 --> 17:55.660
you will have an overwhelming urge 

17:55.660 --> 17:57.940
to stick with your original choice.

17:57.950 --> 18:00.130
But given the fact that the host knows

18:00.130 --> 18:03.620
where the prize is and shows you an empty door,

18:03.670 --> 18:06.780
it is always an advantage for you to switch.

18:06.820 --> 18:07.990
Then it would be confirmed.

18:07.990 --> 18:09.460
Totally confirmed.

18:14.820 --> 18:15.410
Next-

18:15.410 --> 18:16.690
Ready for shrapnel?

18:16.690 --> 18:20.620
Getting the lowdown on "Hit the deck."

18:29.530 --> 18:32.260
Carrie, Grant, and Tori are back at the bomb range.

18:32.260 --> 18:37.500
They're testing the myth of whether a grenade only goes up and out.

18:37.500 --> 18:38.910
If you hit the deck, 

18:38.910 --> 18:40.550
you won't get hit.

18:41.850 --> 18:43.440
Here's what we've learned so far.

18:43.440 --> 18:44.930
When the grenades explodes,

18:44.930 --> 18:47.160
There's about a five-foot perimeter

18:47.160 --> 18:49.930
in which the blast wave is what's going to kill you.

18:49.940 --> 18:51.480
But from the high speed,

18:51.480 --> 18:53.470
it looks like the shrapnel's all going upward,

18:53.470 --> 18:55.980
leaving a safety zone near the ground.

18:56.080 --> 18:58.510
That's where our shrapnel catcher comes in.

18:58.510 --> 19:00.880
Around me are our shrapnel catchers.

19:00.880 --> 19:03.810
The white section represents somebody standing.

19:03.820 --> 19:05.300
The red section 

19:05.550 --> 19:07.650
represents somebody getting down on the ground.

19:08.910 --> 19:10.130
Give me twenty.

19:10.470 --> 19:11.470
Now there are two reasons

19:11.470 --> 19:13.660
why hitting the deck might be advantageous.

19:13.720 --> 19:17.310
First of all, you're minimizing your profile to the grenade.

19:17.310 --> 19:20.870
Secondly, the pattern of the Shrapnel

19:20.870 --> 19:22.760
seems to be going up and out.

19:22.760 --> 19:24.740
That's why we're adding a top to the catcher, 

19:24.740 --> 19:26.460
so we can see what that looks like.

19:27.780 --> 19:29.740
The debris from the preliminary explosion

19:29.740 --> 19:32.740
seems to indicate it's moving up and out.

19:32.740 --> 19:34.260
But to find out for sure, 

19:34.260 --> 19:37.710
any lethal damage from the less visible metal fragments

19:37.710 --> 19:40.370
would mark the painted plywood of these doors.

19:40.370 --> 19:42.660
If the area at the bottom is clear, 

19:42.660 --> 19:44.600
then the myth is confirmed.

19:45.590 --> 19:46.630
Just to cover all our bases,

19:46.630 --> 19:48.700
we're going to use a couple different kinds of grenades.

19:48.700 --> 19:51.450
We have a vintage, mid century pineapple grenade,

19:51.450 --> 19:53.530
and a more modern baseball grenade.

19:53.670 --> 19:56.560
Though these names are somewhat innocuous baseball and pineapple,

19:56.560 --> 19:57.720
the important thing to know is that

19:57.720 --> 19:59.280
they're going to be throwing shrapnel 

19:59.290 --> 20:01.450
at 22,000 feet per second.

20:01.450 --> 20:04.080
To illustrate what we're talking about here, 

20:04.090 --> 20:06.180
the inside of this grenade is perforated.

20:06.180 --> 20:07.810
Each of these little sections

20:07.930 --> 20:09.920
is going to be a lethal projectile.

20:10.910 --> 20:12.550
First up, J.D. hooks up.

20:12.550 --> 20:15.630
The pineapple grenade with distinctive grooves.

20:15.630 --> 20:18.120
And the team heads down to the bunker.

20:18.420 --> 20:19.970
Ready for some sharpnel.

20:19.970 --> 20:21.580
With the remote detonate ring,

20:21.580 --> 20:22.540
it's time to find out

20:22.540 --> 20:25.740
if you can avoid grenade shrapnel by hitting the deck.

20:27.450 --> 20:30.680
In three, two, one --

20:34.420 --> 20:38.150
{pos(190,268)}    

20:38.160 --> 20:40.730
That did some serious damage.

20:40.740 --> 20:43.150
Even knocked over one of the shrapnel catchers.

20:43.150 --> 20:44.960
I think we're going to have a lot of shrapnel.

20:44.960 --> 20:46.310
Let's go check it out.

20:46.310 --> 20:48.460
They found that being around

20:48.460 --> 20:52.490
when a grenade goes off is not a good idea at all.

20:52.490 --> 20:56.450
The shrapnel sprayed on the acrylic roof alone is frightening.

20:57.340 --> 20:58.590
Look at that.

20:58.840 --> 21:00.770
We got a lot of shrapnel.

21:00.770 --> 21:02.360
Did we get it down below?

21:02.370 --> 21:03.420
Yep. Yep.

21:03.420 --> 21:06.040
Looks like this one is busted.

21:06.040 --> 21:08.650
You don't get away scot-free down low.

21:08.650 --> 21:11.000
The shrapnel pattern is clear.

21:11.000 --> 21:13.690
It's even emphasized if you look at the exit wounds.

21:13.690 --> 21:15.780
There's a lot more shrapnel at the top

21:15.840 --> 21:17.330
than there is at the bottom.

21:17.330 --> 21:20.170
Clearly there's still shrapnel at the bottom.

21:20.180 --> 21:21.730
So this myth is busted.

21:22.050 --> 21:24.060
Yep, for the pineapple grenade at least,

21:24.060 --> 21:27.890
the myth that the blast carries all of the shrapnel up and away

21:27.900 --> 21:30.590
and leaves a clear zone near the ground

21:30.590 --> 21:32.210
is busted.

21:32.210 --> 21:33.820
All right. This one is busted.

21:33.830 --> 21:35.600
Why don't we move to the modern-day grenade

21:35.600 --> 21:36.710
and see what that does.

21:36.710 --> 21:37.980
Modern grenade.

21:38.830 --> 21:40.380
The team moves into the double,

21:40.710 --> 21:42.550
and replaces all of the shrapnel catchers.

21:42.900 --> 21:46.230
J.D. does his thing with the baseball grenade.

21:46.620 --> 21:49.040
Okay, baseball grenade shrapnel test.

21:49.320 --> 21:50.050
Do it.

21:50.050 --> 21:51.200
Charging.

21:52.330 --> 21:55.590
In three, two, one --

21:59.320 --> 22:01.720
That was way bigger than the pineapple grenade.

22:01.720 --> 22:03.330
Let's check the shrapnel pattern.

22:03.490 --> 22:07.260
The discovery puts this ballistic myth to bed.

22:10.050 --> 22:10.710
Look at that.

22:10.710 --> 22:13.660
The modern-day grenade had even more shrapnel

22:13.670 --> 22:15.270
in the shrapnel-free zone.

22:15.270 --> 22:16.090
Even if you hit the deck

22:16.090 --> 22:17.880
you're still going to get hit by shrapnel.

22:17.880 --> 22:20.110
The myth when a grenade is going off

22:20.110 --> 22:21.420
and you hit the deck

22:21.420 --> 22:24.710
you'll have no shrapnel hit you is busted.

22:24.710 --> 22:27.500
Ture, the pattern goes upward,

22:27.500 --> 22:30.530
but there's still a lot that goes down below in that zone.

22:31.120 --> 22:33.150
The exit wounds tell the story.

22:33.150 --> 22:36.710
The fragment pattern is a chaotic spray in all directions,

22:36.720 --> 22:39.880
including the mythical shrapnel-free zone.

22:40.290 --> 22:42.710
But it is less dense down low

22:42.710 --> 22:45.850
which suggests that hitting the deck although busted

22:45.850 --> 22:48.870
is the very best of a bad situation.

22:49.070 --> 22:50.710
It might be busted, but look,

22:50.710 --> 22:52.150
if I'm in the situation,

22:52.150 --> 22:53.130
I'm going to hit the deck.

22:53.130 --> 22:54.780
Absolutely.

23:04.350 --> 23:05.880
Coming up on "Mythbusters,"

23:05.880 --> 23:08.330
Adam and I shoot each other in the face.

23:10.640 --> 23:13.300
Do not try what you're about to see at home.

23:13.440 --> 23:15.730
We're what you call experts.

23:23.450 --> 23:24.590
All right.

23:25.030 --> 23:25.700
Let's see here.

23:25.700 --> 23:28.820
"Mythbusters, I've been an action movie fanatic for years

23:28.820 --> 23:29.890
and noticed something about the way

23:29.890 --> 23:31.690
people hold guns in movies.

23:31.690 --> 23:33.650
I've seen them fired from the hip,

23:33.650 --> 23:35.120
fired from a extended arm,

23:35.120 --> 23:38.980
one handed, two handed, and even two guns at the same time,

23:38.990 --> 23:42.130
lately everyone seems to be holding guns sideways.

23:42.140 --> 23:45.060
Do any of these styles offer specific advantages

23:45.060 --> 23:46.770
and accuracy over the others

23:46.770 --> 23:49.620
or are they all just meant to look cool?"

23:49.730 --> 23:51.190
That seems pretty straightforward.

23:51.290 --> 23:52.720
Let's get some guns and targets.

23:52.720 --> 23:54.930
and see which technique is more accurate.

23:54.930 --> 23:56.310
Let's get shooting.

23:57.740 --> 24:00.330
The history of firearm fashion is replayed

24:00.330 --> 24:04.070
with a heap of ever-changing stylish poses.

24:04.260 --> 24:07.560
And this fan request is all about accuracy.

24:07.690 --> 24:11.170
They want to know of five classic cinematic stances

24:11.170 --> 24:15.120
which work and which are style over substance.

24:18.310 --> 24:21.650
To find out, Adam and Jamie are down at the range.

24:22.070 --> 24:23.670
This is perfect. Should we get to shooting?

24:23.670 --> 24:24.850
I think so.

24:24.850 --> 24:26.600
Shooting and shooting.

24:26.880 --> 24:27.930
Here is the plan.

24:27.930 --> 24:29.930
For every single handling technique we'll be testing,

24:29.930 --> 24:33.010
Jamie and I will each unload a full magazine of eight bullets

24:33.010 --> 24:34.320
at the extended targets

24:34.650 --> 24:37.790
and we'll score ourselves base on timing and accuracy.

24:38.050 --> 24:41.350
At the end of the test, a quick look at both targets and scores

24:41.610 --> 24:43.490
really ought to give us a fantastic picture

24:43.870 --> 24:46.860
about which handling techniques are truly effective

24:46.860 --> 24:49.310
and which ones are just for show.

24:49.650 --> 24:51.200
That sounds straightforward.

24:51.200 --> 24:54.050
All they need now are some guns and targets.

24:54.900 --> 24:55.960
Here's today's target.

24:55.960 --> 24:57.470
If you see one of these perched over your bed

24:57.470 --> 24:59.070
in the middle of the night, shoot it.

24:59.070 --> 25:00.340
Shoot it immediately.

25:02.480 --> 25:05.900
The gun we'll be using is a 45 caliber semiautomatic pistol.

25:05.900 --> 25:09.830
We'll put 284 grain full metal jacket ammo in it,

25:09.830 --> 25:13.650
very common gun, very common ammo worldwide.

25:13.700 --> 25:15.510
Scoring, pretty straight forward.

25:15.510 --> 25:18.560
Black section equals ten points; yellow section, seven points,

25:18.560 --> 25:20.340
white, six; red, five.

25:20.340 --> 25:22.370
Once we've tallied the points from shooting,

25:22.370 --> 25:25.270
we will divide that by the amount of seconds

25:25.270 --> 25:26.620
it took to fire all eight bullets,

25:26.620 --> 25:28.400
and that will give us the final score.

25:28.400 --> 25:31.890
The main tool we'll be using is an acoustic timer.

25:31.930 --> 25:33.600
When we press this button --

25:33.940 --> 25:36.250
it will start working and hear each shot

25:36.250 --> 25:38.890
and give us the total amount of time it took

25:38.890 --> 25:40.570
to make the eight shots.

25:40.800 --> 25:42.310
I know you may be looking at the set and think

25:42.310 --> 25:44.090
we're making things pretty easy for ourselves.

25:44.090 --> 25:45.540
But the point of the test isn't about

25:45.540 --> 25:47.280
whether Jamie or I are good shots,

25:47.280 --> 25:49.900
it's actully to compare the different handholds

25:50.070 --> 25:52.580
and their accuracy and effectiveness.

25:52.580 --> 25:53.720
We've chosen this distance

25:53.780 --> 25:56.880
to give us the best resolution for that comparison.

25:57.320 --> 25:58.350
That's the setup.

25:58.350 --> 26:01.040
A gun, two targets 15 feet away,

26:01.040 --> 26:05.290
a scoring system that combines accuracy and firing rate,

26:05.290 --> 26:07.440
and there's a ballistics expert on hand

26:07.440 --> 26:09.180
to keep everyone safe.

26:09.310 --> 26:12.670
The only missing component is a baseline control.

26:12.670 --> 26:13.720
Range is hot.

26:13.720 --> 26:14.730
Safety is on.

26:14.730 --> 26:16.340
We'll be comparing all the firing styles

26:16.350 --> 26:18.160
we're using against this --

26:18.730 --> 26:20.220
The weaver stance.

26:20.670 --> 26:21.900
It's been using since the 1980s

26:21.910 --> 26:23.590
by law enforcement and in competition,

26:23.590 --> 26:25.560
and it's regarded as the most effective way

26:25.560 --> 26:28.940
to repeatedly and accurately fire a handgun.

26:29.170 --> 26:29.810
That's good shooting.

26:29.810 --> 26:31.280
It's a really good group.

26:31.280 --> 26:33.620
And Jamie and I have been trained in it.

26:34.240 --> 26:37.280
The weaver position has a couple of things going for it.

26:37.880 --> 26:40.470
The first is that it feels nice and stable.

26:40.470 --> 26:42.220
You're using both hands.

26:42.220 --> 26:45.120
You've got a good, solid purchase on the gun.

26:45.120 --> 26:46.140
The second thing is

26:46.140 --> 26:47.970
if you're holding it in such a position

26:47.970 --> 26:50.550
that you can see down the sights of the gun.

26:50.550 --> 26:53.700
That also seems like a pretty good idea.

26:54.270 --> 26:56.440
With the weaver technique complete,

26:56.750 --> 26:58.490
the scores can be co-lated.

26:58.510 --> 27:01.570
And if any of the other five hollywood poses to be tested

27:01.570 --> 27:05.700
come close to Adam and Jamie's controlled average of 7.3,

27:05.700 --> 27:08.750
it will be confirmed it's a reasonable technique.

27:10.680 --> 27:12.500
All right. We've got our control.

27:12.500 --> 27:14.210
Let's start holding the gun in another way.

27:14.570 --> 27:17.430
First up, popularized by bogart

27:17.430 --> 27:19.970
in gangster movies of the '30s and '40s,

27:19.970 --> 27:21.840
it's shooting from the hip.

27:22.800 --> 27:23.440
I don't know about you, 

27:23.450 --> 27:25.940
but I don't have high hopes for this stance.

27:26.230 --> 27:28.060
Come on, you can't even see the sights,

27:28.060 --> 27:29.420
how are you going to know where you're aiming?

27:29.420 --> 27:30.830
And after the gun resets,

27:30.830 --> 27:32.720
how are you going to get the second shot?

27:32.720 --> 27:34.470
I don't think it's going to be that effective.

27:34.470 --> 27:36.740
Jamie's been shooting from the hip for years.

27:37.430 --> 27:38.580
Ready?

27:38.690 --> 27:39.930
Safety's off.

27:40.160 --> 27:41.790
Shooting from the hip.

27:42.910 --> 27:45.010
As Jamie fires off his eight rounds,

27:45.010 --> 27:47.510
it seems Adam's prediction is spot on --

27:47.510 --> 27:49.520
Jamie missed all eight.

27:50.370 --> 27:52.020
You just got no clue where it's going.

27:52.020 --> 27:54.720
You're just sort of like,

27:54.720 --> 27:57.000
well, that seems about right.

27:57.200 --> 27:58.660
I can't wait to try.

27:58.660 --> 27:59.710
Good luck.

27:59.770 --> 28:02.150
This is a crazy position to shoot from.

28:03.500 --> 28:06.110
With a few hits lossless right around the target,

28:06.120 --> 28:09.090
Adam is marginally more successful than Jamie.

28:09.100 --> 28:12.620
But this classic stance is clearly not ideal.

28:14.330 --> 28:17.400
It's crazy. There's just no kinesthetic reset down here.

28:17.400 --> 28:19.600
You're hoping every single time.

28:19.600 --> 28:21.350
Let's figure out what the score is.

28:21.430 --> 28:24.350
At scoreboard the story is a sorry tale of woe

28:24.360 --> 28:27.190
for the first hollywood handling technique.

28:27.230 --> 28:31.450
An average of 2.8 is significantly short of the control.

28:31.500 --> 28:34.120
Meaning that method is busted.

28:34.430 --> 28:35.300
That was fun.

28:35.300 --> 28:37.660
It's not over yet, there's more to go.

28:39.020 --> 28:40.620
Coming up on "Mythbusters,"

28:40.620 --> 28:43.110
Fix your tire by fire.

28:44.750 --> 28:46.110
It's gonna blow!

28:55.180 --> 28:56.940
Jamie and Adam have already proved

28:56.940 --> 28:59.420
that as far as firearm fashion goes,

28:59.420 --> 29:01.820
shooting from the hip might look cool,

29:01.820 --> 29:03.860
but it's just not very effective.

29:04.350 --> 29:07.510
It's crazy. There's just no kinesthetic reset down there.

29:07.510 --> 29:09.610
You're hoping every single time.

29:09.610 --> 29:12.310
Up next, the straight arm from the shoulder.

29:12.310 --> 29:16.620
It peaked in popularity in the cheesy action movies of the '80s,

29:16.690 --> 29:19.300
but has long been a stylish staple.

29:20.730 --> 29:22.390
But will it work?

29:22.390 --> 29:23.150
My feeling is

29:23.210 --> 29:25.280
that the straight-arm position is going to be good

29:25.290 --> 29:28.340
because I am able to line up with the sights

29:28.480 --> 29:31.780
as well as my body in a fairly stable position.

29:32.960 --> 29:36.230
Jamie unloads and before the points are tallied,

29:36.620 --> 29:39.020
it's clear the position is working well.

29:39.460 --> 29:41.170
Nice shooting, Tex.

29:41.340 --> 29:43.120
As Adams demonstrates,

29:43.120 --> 29:46.010
Adam, straight-arm shooting.

29:46.010 --> 29:47.440
compared to the hip shot, 

29:47.440 --> 29:50.820
it's stable which enables rapid, repeat firing.

29:50.820 --> 29:52.900
And being able to use the gun's sights 

29:52.900 --> 29:55.060
is another obvious advantage.

29:58.310 --> 29:59.610
That's fun.

29:59.710 --> 30:01.390
It all boils down to a score

30:01.390 --> 30:05.200
that compares extremely favorably with the control.

30:06.260 --> 30:06.850
I love this.

30:07.000 --> 30:08.920
It's almost -- almost as much as I like the weaver.

30:08.920 --> 30:10.920
It gives a tremendous amount of control.

30:10.920 --> 30:14.020
The accuracy was as good as the weaver stance.

30:14.020 --> 30:15.620
This one's a winner.

30:16.040 --> 30:17.830
Next up is the gangster style, right?

30:17.830 --> 30:18.390
Yes, yes.

30:18.390 --> 30:20.090
What we were just doing, like this, 

30:20.090 --> 30:23.040
body on the side, except with the gun turned.

30:23.120 --> 30:25.010
Like we're a straight-up thug.

30:27.030 --> 30:28.560
A staple of the '90s,

30:28.560 --> 30:32.330
hoodlums seem to think a 90-degree twist

30:32.330 --> 30:34.880
adds something to their shooting.

30:35.660 --> 30:37.140
But does it really?

30:37.140 --> 30:39.170
Adam's excited to find out.

30:40.890 --> 30:44.120
I have always wanted hold a gun this way.

30:44.770 --> 30:46.880
I've heard tell that you could break your wrist.

30:46.880 --> 30:48.360
Clearly I don't think that's about to happen, 

30:48.360 --> 30:50.420
but I'm interested to see what my accuracy is like.

30:50.420 --> 30:51.840
Ok, I'm ready.

30:57.280 --> 30:58.570
Did I hit it once?

30:58.820 --> 31:00.760
Although the straight arm did enable Adam 

31:00.760 --> 31:02.800
to fire off his rounds quickly enough,

31:02.800 --> 31:04.430
his score was poor.

31:04.530 --> 31:06.610
Final score of 1.0.

31:06.610 --> 31:08.060
Let's see how Jamie does.

31:08.060 --> 31:10.430
Mr. Hyneman, Gangsta style.

31:12.010 --> 31:15.620
Looking suspiciously natural in the Gangsta pose,

31:15.620 --> 31:17.820
Jamie outscores Adam.

31:17.820 --> 31:21.630
- Final score 1.6. - Nice, Gangsta.

31:21.630 --> 31:24.480
When totaled into the table, the result tells us

31:24.480 --> 31:28.820
this funky-looking firearm fashion is, frankly, defunct.

31:29.300 --> 31:31.720
I'll be honest with you, the Gangsta style,

31:31.730 --> 31:33.650
it's the one I was anticipating the most.

31:33.650 --> 31:35.040
After shooting with it, 

31:35.040 --> 31:37.120
it is by far the most ridiculous of all.

31:37.190 --> 31:38.860
You can't see where your bullets are going.

31:38.960 --> 31:40.360
You have no point of reference.

31:40.360 --> 31:41.780
You're looking at the wrong part.

31:41.780 --> 31:43.650
You're ignoring useful sights

31:43.660 --> 31:45.070
that are right -- forget about it.

31:45.080 --> 31:46.440
Don't shoot that way.

31:51.430 --> 31:53.710
Wheel of mythfortune.

31:54.010 --> 31:54.870
What we got?

31:54.870 --> 31:55.930
All right.

31:57.290 --> 31:58.740
"Dear Mythbusters, is it true

31:58.840 --> 32:02.760
that you can re-seat and inflated a tire using fire"?

32:02.760 --> 32:04.210
There are so many videos on the Internet.

32:04.210 --> 32:07.810
People put something flammable in it, light it, 

32:08.210 --> 32:11.220
and it re-seats, inflates,

32:11.220 --> 32:12.460
and stays inflated.

32:12.460 --> 32:13.430
Sounds simple enough.

32:13.430 --> 32:15.570
All we need is a tire and starter fluid.

32:15.570 --> 32:18.770
- This could be so dangerous. - Or explosive.

32:20.020 --> 32:20.960
Where there's fire,

32:20.960 --> 32:23.600
there's folks who just can't help themselves.

32:23.600 --> 32:26.210
Despite the danger, the Mythbusters want to know

32:26.210 --> 32:30.550
if these clips of explosive roadside assistance are real.

32:30.680 --> 32:32.350
Can you really re-seat 

32:32.350 --> 32:36.020
and inflate a tire by heating things up?

32:37.070 --> 32:39.180
There's only one way to find out.

32:40.610 --> 32:42.170
Getting a flat on a deserted road.

32:42.390 --> 32:45.190
This is how all horror movies start.

32:45.840 --> 32:47.420
Imagine you're in a deserted location,

32:47.420 --> 32:50.030
you've got a flat tire, and you've got no spare.

32:50.030 --> 32:51.710
That's what this myth is all about.

32:51.710 --> 32:53.930
Seating a tire on a rim and inflating it

32:53.940 --> 32:58.140
when you've got nothing but a can of starter fluid and a lighter.

32:58.270 --> 32:59.440
Now in the internet clip,

32:59.440 --> 33:02.920
we see a man spray starter fluid into the deflated tire.

33:02.920 --> 33:05.730
He lights a match and it reseats instantly

33:05.730 --> 33:07.820
and inflates, and stays inflated.

33:07.820 --> 33:09.710
That is what we're going to be testing.

33:09.710 --> 33:11.440
We're going to try this with a classic tire.

33:11.450 --> 33:12.700
If that doesn't work, 

33:13.610 --> 33:14.960
we're going to move on to a truck tire

33:14.960 --> 33:16.380
because it has thicker walls.

33:16.390 --> 33:20.030
First up, the regular-size tire which Kari lets down

33:20.030 --> 33:23.240
before getting dressed up for a date with danger.

33:23.920 --> 33:25.310
Good luck, Kari.

33:25.730 --> 33:26.950
Here's your fluid.

33:26.960 --> 33:28.000
Here's your lighter.

33:28.010 --> 33:29.440
Don't blow yourself up.

33:29.520 --> 33:30.680
Just like the video, 

33:30.690 --> 33:34.030
the tire is deflated and unseated from the rim.

33:34.030 --> 33:36.250
And also just like the reference clip,

33:36.260 --> 33:40.800
Kari sprays an accelerant into the tire before lighting it.

33:42.960 --> 33:44.930
Well, we got a tire on fire.

33:45.320 --> 33:47.390
But it's just a big letdown.

33:47.390 --> 33:48.570
It's not inflating.

33:48.570 --> 33:49.600
No.

33:50.280 --> 33:52.520
It doesn't go poof like that.

33:52.520 --> 33:53.760
Let's try that again.

33:53.760 --> 33:54.500
Take two.

33:54.500 --> 33:57.410
This time, Tori pumps his feet on the tire,

33:57.410 --> 33:59.600
mixing accelerant with air.

34:00.110 --> 34:02.920
We'll see if we get air in there for a better mix ratio.

34:06.040 --> 34:07.730
That worked like a charm.

34:07.870 --> 34:12.110
Except now they seem to have a rapidly inflating tire on fire.

34:12.190 --> 34:15.830
That means an explosion is a very real possibility.

34:17.710 --> 34:19.000
It's going to go.

34:19.440 --> 34:21.800
Maybe we should all step a little bit further back.

34:21.800 --> 34:22.480
Okay.

34:22.480 --> 34:24.440
That was probably the most terrifying tire inflating 

34:24.440 --> 34:25.960
I've ever experienced.

34:28.270 --> 34:30.739
Seems like a really dangerous way to fill a tire.

34:30.739 --> 34:32.770
We got the starter fluid into the tire,

34:32.770 --> 34:34.679
we got the mixture right, Kari lit it,

34:34.690 --> 34:38.230
and it instantly seated and inflated just like in the video.

34:38.230 --> 34:39.380
In fact, it worked so well

34:39.380 --> 34:41.110
that it looked like the tire was going to explode,

34:41.110 --> 34:42.909
and we all took off running.

34:44.900 --> 34:46.540
However, when it was all said and done,

34:46.810 --> 34:49.210
a lot of cooling happened, a lot of fuel was burned,

34:49.350 --> 34:52.090
and we created a vacuum inside the tire.

34:52.440 --> 34:54.380
Look. It's a vacuum.

34:55.940 --> 34:57.160
I wouldn't call that inflated.

34:57.160 --> 34:59.620
I call that the opposite of inflated.

34:59.630 --> 35:01.140
There are a couple parts this myth.

35:01.140 --> 35:03.240
One, does it seat the tire on the rim?

35:03.240 --> 35:05.060
Yes, you ignite the gases,

35:05.060 --> 35:08.160
they expand rapidly, and it pops off.

35:08.160 --> 35:09.830
Two, does it inflate the tire?

35:09.830 --> 35:12.780
Yes, it actually inflates it very quickly.

35:12.780 --> 35:14.520
And it almost looks like it's going to blow up.

35:14.520 --> 35:17.310
Three and most important, does it stay inflated?

35:17.570 --> 35:20.980
No because as the gas is cooled it forms a vacuum.

35:20.980 --> 35:24.120
You see the tire shrink back onto the rim.

35:24.180 --> 35:26.120
This one is busted.

35:26.120 --> 35:26.710
Busted.

35:26.770 --> 35:28.800
But there is some truth to the myth.

35:28.810 --> 35:32.320
It's an excellent if highly dangerous method of re-seating

35:32.320 --> 35:34.700
and briefly inflating the tire.

35:34.700 --> 35:36.840
It just doesn't stay inflated.

35:36.840 --> 35:38.310
But the team isn't done yet.

35:38.310 --> 35:41.110
Next up, heavy-duty truck tire.

35:41.110 --> 35:42.990
The clip the viewer sent in showed

35:42.990 --> 35:45.660
the trick being done on a truck tire.

35:45.870 --> 35:47.730
To cover all their bases,

35:47.730 --> 35:49.370
they're giving that a go.

35:50.070 --> 35:53.620
One again, Kari gets the accelerant right into the tire

35:53.620 --> 35:55.160
before lighting it.

35:58.280 --> 35:58.910
Nice!

35:58.910 --> 36:00.040
It worked.

36:00.250 --> 36:01.880
But did it really?

36:02.190 --> 36:04.860
Look, it's lost its inflation.

36:06.350 --> 36:07.940
So it's a great party trick

36:07.940 --> 36:11.510
- but not really good for road repairs.  - Not practical.

36:11.510 --> 36:14.570
The initial rapid expansion of gases from the explosion

36:14.570 --> 36:16.820
does pop the tire onto the rim.

36:16.820 --> 36:18.680
But when the gases cool,

36:18.680 --> 36:21.000
we're pretty much back to square one.

36:22.200 --> 36:23.100
Now, if you were watching the video,

36:23.180 --> 36:25.540
it seemed that seating and inflating your tire

36:25.640 --> 36:28.490
with fire is dangerous. Well, it is.

36:28.490 --> 36:31.380
However, it does work. You can seat the tire,

36:31.380 --> 36:33.330
but it does not stay inflated.

36:33.330 --> 36:37.980
You still need some kind of compressed air to keep the tire filled.

36:37.980 --> 36:39.180
So, this one's busted.

36:45.120 --> 36:46.850
Coming up on "Mythbusters",

36:46.850 --> 36:48.450
Jamie, you look bad ass.

36:48.450 --> 36:49.730
Duck and cover,

36:49.840 --> 36:52.050
because Jamie's letting loose.

36:59.770 --> 37:01.140
Welcome back. We have been testing

37:01.240 --> 37:05.230
a bunch of gun-handling techniques that we have seen in the movies.

37:05.440 --> 37:08.030
Now it's time to add another layer.

37:08.330 --> 37:09.640
A gun-shaped layer.

37:09.640 --> 37:13.120
That's right. It's now time for two guns.

37:15.120 --> 37:18.610
So, "Matrix" style two gun play is up next.

37:18.610 --> 37:22.900
Are you doubling your chance of a ballistics bull's eye?

37:24.520 --> 37:27.250
Jamie, you look bad ass, I'll tell you that.

37:27.500 --> 37:28.720
- Ready.  - Here we go.

37:28.720 --> 37:31.170
There's one important factor to note.

37:31.170 --> 37:33.730
Despite using doubled the amount of ammo,

37:33.730 --> 37:36.010
the final time-adjusted score

37:36.010 --> 37:39.100
will still give an accurate comparison to the control.

37:39.130 --> 37:43.470
After all, firing twice as many bullets takes twice as long.

37:43.470 --> 37:45.280
Nice work, hombre.

37:45.850 --> 37:47.180
That was an experience.

37:47.180 --> 37:49.990
And there's a certain kind of symmetry to it that I liked.

37:49.990 --> 37:54.400
You can almost brace your hands together on each other while you're firing.

37:54.400 --> 37:56.900
Before we tally the total, Adam's up.

37:56.910 --> 38:00.370
Despite Jamie's having a tactically experience,

38:00.460 --> 38:01.790
Adam's not confident.

38:01.790 --> 38:02.680
Take these.

38:02.680 --> 38:05.420
Bang, bang, bang.

38:05.420 --> 38:07.570
Low score, low score. Moving on, right?

38:07.690 --> 38:08.890
That's what I'm expecting.

38:08.920 --> 38:10.460
Okay, here we go. Safety's off.

38:12.020 --> 38:15.280
Yep, the balance and symmetry of shooting two guns at once

38:15.290 --> 38:17.400
may be the reason it looks so cool.

38:17.630 --> 38:20.720
But really, it's a tricky feat of coordination 

38:20.730 --> 38:23.550
that makes real marksmanship tough.

38:25.850 --> 38:27.670
- That was awesome.  - Isn't it?

38:27.670 --> 38:29.720
Yes. I really liked how that feels.

38:29.720 --> 38:32.230
It's like a rocking horse of death.

38:32.230 --> 38:33.830
Jamie's totally right.

38:33.830 --> 38:36.140
Two guns might not mean double the score,

38:36.140 --> 38:37.460
but it's super fun.

38:37.460 --> 38:39.310
You end up with this kind of rhythm

38:39.310 --> 38:41.470
where you're rocking your head and firing.

38:41.470 --> 38:43.420
Bang, bang, bang, bang.

38:43.420 --> 38:46.700
Feels very, kind of, weirdly natural,

38:46.700 --> 38:48.380
and like you're a cartoon character.

38:48.380 --> 38:50.080
So, what could be better?

38:50.540 --> 38:52.030
The score for one thing.

38:52.030 --> 38:54.730
Because the final tally of 4.1

38:55.070 --> 38:58.300
means it might be an adrenaline-surging tad of fun,

38:58.300 --> 39:01.090
it's also a whole heap of busted.

39:02.460 --> 39:04.050
Haven't we covered just about everything?

39:04.050 --> 39:05.920
Just about. There's one more thing I want to try.

39:05.920 --> 39:08.280
We've done two guns toward one target.

39:08.280 --> 39:10.560
In the movies I've seen this --

39:10.600 --> 39:12.700
Crossed hands, two different targets.

39:12.700 --> 39:14.020
I think we should try it.

39:14.020 --> 39:15.590
- Why not?  - All right.

39:15.590 --> 39:17.210
These aren't real guns, these are our stand-in guns 

39:17.210 --> 39:19.350
because I don't point real guns at our cameraman.

39:21.510 --> 39:24.470
It's where ballet meet ballistic gun play.

39:24.470 --> 39:27.820
The ultimate and slick cinematic choreography.

39:27.820 --> 39:30.110
But Adam is unimpressed.

39:30.630 --> 39:32.910
Criss-cross is ridiculous,

39:32.910 --> 39:35.690
I'd say now that it's second only to the Gangsta style

39:35.690 --> 39:38.870
in ridiculousness and the lack of effectiveness.

39:38.870 --> 39:41.060
With the targets several feet apart, 

39:41.060 --> 39:45.740
Jamie gets his bearings, lines up, and unleashes hell.

39:53.270 --> 39:54.280
You looked like you were going

39:54.280 --> 39:56.970
a little popcorn machine there for a second.

39:57.330 --> 39:59.790
I figured I might as well have fun with it.

39:59.790 --> 40:01.670
Yep, he was off-balance,

40:01.670 --> 40:04.940
and the patting your head while rubbing your stomach-type action

40:04.960 --> 40:07.690
means coordination was also an issue.

40:07.950 --> 40:10.200
All of which was reflected in a low score

40:10.200 --> 40:12.740
that matches the pre-test prediction.

40:12.970 --> 40:15.140
Final score, 2.1.

40:15.140 --> 40:16.520
But there's no denying.

40:16.520 --> 40:20.830
Jamie did look every inch the cool cinematic hitman --

40:20.990 --> 40:24.620
something, as he takes his position, Adam aspires to.

40:24.620 --> 40:26.980
And as he fires at the dual targets,

40:26.980 --> 40:30.320
it turns out it's a role Adam believes he can fill.

40:30.510 --> 40:33.430
Not bad. Not bad at all.

40:34.460 --> 40:37.640
The stance was much more effective than he expected.

40:38.480 --> 40:41.300
- Final score was 7.1.  - Nice.

40:41.300 --> 40:43.220
Which is pretty good. That's pretty good.

40:43.220 --> 40:46.540
Despite Adam's surprisingly healthy points total,

40:46.540 --> 40:50.130
and considering he used twice as many rounds as the control,

40:50.220 --> 40:54.410
in the final analysis, it just doesn't cut it.

40:54.580 --> 40:57.130
I thought because you could brace your arms against each other

40:57.130 --> 40:57.990
it might work.

40:58.090 --> 40:59.170
But it doesn't.

40:59.170 --> 41:02.920
You'd be much better off using a proper technique and one gun.

41:03.170 --> 41:05.600
Crisscross is clearly busted.

41:05.620 --> 41:08.470
So with criss-cross consigned to the busted bin,

41:08.470 --> 41:13.460
let's get the lowdown on the history of filming firearm fashion.

41:13.690 --> 41:16.310
Let's assess what we've learned. Shall we?

41:16.310 --> 41:17.620
We started with the Weaver technique,

41:17.620 --> 41:20.500
the best score and best clustering for Jamie and I.

41:20.500 --> 41:21.850
We went to shooting from the hip

41:21.860 --> 41:24.440
which was pretty much the worst.

41:26.160 --> 41:28.100
When you did look down the sights,

41:28.100 --> 41:29.480
as we did by holding the gun at the sight,

41:29.480 --> 41:30.990
we did pretty darn well.

41:30.990 --> 41:32.270
We get most of the bullets on the target

41:32.270 --> 41:34.310
and the second best score to the Weaver

41:34.310 --> 41:36.820
Gangsta style, what can I say? 

41:37.090 --> 41:38.230
It's terrible, ridiculous.

41:38.230 --> 41:41.390
It's totally a useless way to hold a handgun.

41:41.580 --> 41:43.090
We brought two guns into the mix,

41:43.090 --> 41:45.000
and what we saw when we brought two guns into the mix?

41:45.010 --> 41:47.560
We doubled the bullets, but did not double the scores.

41:47.560 --> 41:50.560
In fact, the scores most of the time went down except for,

41:50.560 --> 41:53.080
I think, couple of lucky shots for me at the end.

41:53.080 --> 41:55.320
After looking at all of this, I have to conclude that,

41:55.320 --> 41:57.180
as long as you're looking down the sights

41:57.180 --> 41:59.440
of a single gun and concentrating on it,

41:59.450 --> 42:02.150
you're going to have the most effective shooting technique.

42:02.160 --> 42:03.680
You don't need two guns.

42:06.740 --> 42:09.290
- This wheel thing worked pretty well.  - It did.

42:09.310 --> 42:10.850
But I'm wondering, what do we do with the myths

42:10.890 --> 42:12.980
we haven't read or filmed yet?

42:13.130 --> 42:15.090
Well, let's leave this thing set up.

42:15.180 --> 42:17.440
I have a feeling we're going to be using it again.

42:17.500 --> 42:18.280
All right.

42:18.340 --> 42:21.140
