Yeah. I did.

20:47.331 --> 20:48.671
Was that Michael?

20:51.043 --> 20:51.963
What?

20:52.044 --> 20:55.054
You said it the other day at the museum
when you were kind of out of it.

20:55.130 --> 20:56.420
What did I say?

20:58.423 --> 20:59.423
What were you like then?

21:03.931 --> 21:05.431
It's not your turn, honey.

21:13.565 --> 21:14.815
-Hold that.
-Oh.

21:14.900 --> 21:16.030
[giggles]

21:16.109 --> 21:18.109
I'm telling you, it's still open.

21:24.199 --> 21:26.909
I can come up
with a different one, okay? 'Cause...

21:27.496 --> 21:29.866
Do you see that?
They closed at ten o'clock, okay?

21:29.957 --> 21:33.127
-All right, that's it.
-You said get in the hotel pool.

21:34.002 --> 21:34.922
That was my dare.

21:35.504 --> 21:37.214
I don't go back on a dare.

21:38.006 --> 21:39.546
[Michael sighs]

21:39.633 --> 21:42.643
Well, I admire your dedication.

22:15.502 --> 22:17.252
-It's cold.
-Yeah.

22:17.337 --> 22:19.087
I'm sure that it is.

22:20.090 --> 22:23.390
-Ooh.
-Oh, they have robes.

22:23.468 --> 22:25.348
-Feels good, once you're in.
-Ah.

22:26.513 --> 22:27.643
They have some towels--

22:27.723 --> 22:30.063
-Come on!
-Hey, hey, hey, my phone! Look what--

22:30.142 --> 22:31.142
[giggles]

22:31.226 --> 22:34.016
Come on, when was the last time
you did something impulsive?

22:34.104 --> 22:36.444
I have this standing by for you
when you're ready.

22:38.567 --> 22:41.897
Where's that kid
from Bobby Drucker's party?

22:41.985 --> 22:43.315
Oh!

22:46.366 --> 22:48.196
[Alexis laughing]

22:48.285 --> 22:51.325
-Happy?
-Shocked!

22:51.411 --> 22:54.291
See? I'm not so square, you know?

23:25.112 --> 23:26.452
Come on, I did it for you.

23:27.074 --> 23:28.874
You said you'd do anything tonight.

23:39.044 --> 23:40.464
Liquid courage.

23:45.801 --> 23:46.801
Okay.

23:47.719 --> 23:50.889
Just give me a second.
I need to get into character.

23:51.682 --> 23:52.932
[Sidney] Shit. No, wait.

23:57.312 --> 23:58.402

26:27.671 --> 26:29.721
I love being told what to do.

Take these off.

26:59.161 --> 27:01.621
You're so fucking perfect.

27:03.040 --> 27:04.370
Look at you.

27:07.294 --> 27:09.844
Not a single crack in the facade.

27:09.919 --> 27:12.459
Don't judge a book by its cover.

27:28.649 --> 27:31.569
[Sidney] I'll tell you what to do,
I know you're new to all this.

27:35.447 --> 27:37.737
You don't need to tell me anything.

27:54.216 --> 27:55.126
[Alexis] Oh!

27:56.844 --> 27:58.974
Well, that was, um... that was...

27:59.513 --> 28:00.433
unexpected.

28:00.514 --> 28:02.564
I can't believe you ruined your suit.

28:02.641 --> 28:04.061
No, it'll dry.

28:04.142 --> 28:05.942
And it felt good. You were right.

28:07.354 --> 28:09.114
I'm kind of not ready to go to bed yet.

28:09.189 --> 28:11.109
Oh, come on,
we have such an early flight.

28:11.191 --> 28:13.571
Come on,
when do we ever get a chance to do this?

28:14.152 --> 28:15.782
One more drink, Grandpa.

28:16.486 --> 28:19.276
Are you sure you don't wanna be a lawyer?
You're very convincing.

28:24.119 --> 28:26.249
Okay, well, um...

28:26.623 --> 28:30.503
I'll just see if there's anything decent
in the minibar.

[Sidney and Jean kissing, moaning]

29:15.464 --> 29:18.014
-[Sidney] Let's get high.
-What?

29:18.967 --> 29:20.217
-Now?
-Yeah.

29:20.886 --> 29:21.886
Oh, wait here.

29:25.182 --> 29:26.272
[whispers] Oh, God.

[breathing heavily]

29:57.840 --> 29:59.420
-Hey.
-Hey.

29:59.508 --> 30:00.548
What's that?

30:01.510 --> 30:05.060
Frances stores it here sometimes.
He sells on the side.

30:08.475 --> 30:09.345
Uh...

30:10.894 --> 30:12.904
I usually just stick to joints.

30:12.977 --> 30:15.397
I don't like to be totally out of control.

30:16.108 --> 30:17.068
I figured.

30:20.360 --> 30:21.570
Blue Dream's my favorite.

30:22.239 --> 30:24.829
It's supposed to be inspiring
and open up your mind.

30:26.533 --> 30:27.743
Sounds good.

30:34.001 --> 30:35.091
Do you smoke a lot?

30:36.712 --> 30:37.882
I used to.

30:37.963 --> 30:39.343
And shut up.

30:43.260 --> 30:45.010
You have the best orgasms high.

30:48.557 --> 30:49.597
Well, I do.

30:58.483 --> 31:00.403
[coughing]

31:00.485 --> 31:02.905
-[Sidney] What?
-Holy shit.

31:02.988 --> 31:06.238
[laughing] You know you get higher,
the more you cough, yeah?

31:06.950 --> 31:09.040
And fuck up your lungs.

31:09.828 --> 31:11.368
You only live once.

31:13.332 --> 31:14.632
Trust me.

31:15.415 --> 31:16.745
I get that.

31:20.380 --> 31:22.220
So, have you always been
into robbing the cradle?

31:22.297 --> 31:26.127
No, and you make me sound like
a fucking criminal the way you say that.

31:27.387 --> 31:29.387
Well, you must have had girl crushes.

31:31.975 --> 31:33.935
It didn't really work that way for me.

31:35.521 --> 31:36.401
I mean...

31:37.731 --> 31:39.531
Yeah, I was always into men.

31:41.193 --> 31:42.193
I think.

31:42.778 --> 31:43.778
You would know.

31:46.529 --> 31:49.869
I just think if you just focus so much
on what you should feel...

31:51.912 --> 31:54.412
you don't really know
what it is you do feel.

31:58.877 --> 32:00.047
Deep.

32:17.521 --> 32:18.771
You feel that?

32:27.948 --> 32:29.698
Where are you going now?

32:33.745 --> 32:34.995
[scoffs]

32:39.376 --> 32:40.496
[sighs deeply]

32:48.427 --> 32:51.177
[Sam] It's like staring at the sun.

32:52.347 --> 32:53.677
You know you should probably stop,

32:53.765 --> 32:55.975
but it's the most intense feeling
in the whole world

32:56.059 --> 32:57.939
that you can't help but look.

34:05.379 --> 34:07.379
[Sidney] It's not showing up on Seamless.

34:07.881 --> 34:10.511
What? Who are you talking to?

34:10.592 --> 34:12.092
The pizza place.

34:13.887 --> 34:14.717
Are you okay?

34:17.474 --> 34:18.434
Yeah.

34:18.516 --> 34:20.766
I mean,
you look like you've seen a ghost.

34:23.021 --> 34:24.900
I think I'm just really high.

34:26.692 --> 34:27.692
Huh.

34:28.193 --> 34:29.572
[Michael] Are we still playing?

34:30.400 --> 34:33.110
Sure. It's the only way you'll answer.

34:35.951 --> 34:37.661
[slowly] Okay...

34:37.744 --> 34:39.583
Uh, ask away.

34:40.038 --> 34:41.538
Okay, well...

34:42.373 --> 34:44.004
Well, for example, marriage.

34:44.083 --> 34:47.464
I mean, you and Jean, you seem
to have it all figured out pretty well.

34:48.045 --> 34:51.335
Um, well, this could be the alcohol...

34:52.384 --> 34:54.514
talking,
but it's nice to voice it sometimes.

34:54.594 --> 34:55.594
I'm not actually...

34:56.929 --> 34:57.970
sure...

34:59.099 --> 35:01.729
what is going on in my marriage right now.

35:06.899 --> 35:08.479
Okay, I'm not, um...

35:09.234 --> 35:10.574
I'm not really following.

35:13.363 --> 35:15.623
It's something I've known about
for a long time now.

35:15.699 --> 35:17.619
When we took our break, it was because...

35:20.037 --> 35:21.327
Jean was...

35:22.745 --> 35:25.785
unsure if she could actually commit.

35:27.836 --> 35:29.916
Yeah... so...

35:31.381 --> 35:32.221
[scoffs]

35:32.633 --> 35:34.433
Maybe that's just her nature.

35:36.053 --> 35:36.973
I mean...

35:38.847 --> 35:40.097
-Um...
-I know.

35:41.558 --> 35:42.388
I know.

35:43.894 --> 35:45.854
[clears his throat]
And it's fine, it's fine.

35:45.938 --> 35:46.898
Totally fine.

35:47.564 --> 35:48.944
That's when you met Catherine.

35:50.442 --> 35:52.242
I mean,
I thought it was a one-night stand.

35:52.319 --> 35:54.359
I thought it was--
'cause I was primed for it.

35:56.114 --> 35:58.874
On the rebound
after everything exploded with Jean,

35:58.951 --> 35:59.991
but, um...

36:02.118 --> 36:03.788
I couldn't let her go.

36:04.287 --> 36:08.537
Wow... can barely picture that.

36:10.462 --> 36:11.672
I felt this...

36:16.468 --> 36:20.758
strange permission to be someone else.

36:21.765 --> 36:23.805
I love that feeling, it's...

36:24.685 --> 36:26.895
It's like there are no rules or...

36:26.979 --> 36:28.269
restrictions.

♪ Whisper something in your ear ♪

36:48.417 --> 36:49.877
I can see the truth.

36:50.458 --> 36:52.038
It's called being high.

36:53.463 --> 36:55.303
But tell me, genius, what's the truth?

36:56.133 --> 36:57.633
Well, there is none.

36:58.594 --> 36:59.934
What do you mean?

37:00.179 --> 37:01.259
It's...

37:01.930 --> 37:04.180
It's all just perspective.

37:05.434 --> 37:10.484
Nothing is real except for what you see
in this exact moment.

37:12.608 --> 37:14.688
Which means you can't chase the truth.

37:15.274 --> 37:17.824
[laughing] You're high.

37:18.405 --> 37:20.155
[laughs]

37:24.411 --> 37:26.211
Why did you date him so long?

37:26.914 --> 37:29.124
-Who?
-Sam.

37:32.920 --> 37:34.170
You're jealous of him.

37:36.048 --> 37:37.218
I'm not...

37:37.674 --> 37:38.594
I don't think.

37:39.343 --> 37:42.353
Apparently I fucked him up so bad,
he even sees a therapist now.

37:42.927 --> 37:46.637
And she's clearly not helping. I mean,
he's seeing his ex again. Emily.

37:47.100 --> 37:48.310
Fucking trainwreck.

37:50.437 --> 37:51.857
Now you sound jealous.

37:53.440 --> 37:54.360
[Sidney] No.

37:56.527 --> 37:59.107
But apparently,
this therapist is super hot.

38:00.864 --> 38:03.374
How do you know that she's hot?

38:04.368 --> 38:07.618
Well, Sam told Emily, and so it continues.

38:11.041 --> 38:12.461
What was the sex like?

38:13.377 --> 38:14.337
Insane.

38:15.587 --> 38:16.667
I mean...

38:17.548 --> 38:21.548
he's a horny motherfucker,
and I basically need it all the time.

38:25.722 --> 38:26.812
Does that turn you on?

38:28.225 --> 38:29.305
Maybe.

38:31.270 --> 38:34.230
Now you tell me... about this Michael.

38:35.858 --> 38:36.978
Why'd you break up?

38:38.735 --> 38:39.815
If I tell you...

38:41.113 --> 38:42.363
you won't believe me.

38:42.531 --> 38:43.491
Try me.

38:47.494 --> 38:48.584
You.

38:51.290 --> 38:52.540
[Michael] When we first met,

38:53.584 --> 38:55.464
Jean was free-spirited.

38:57.087 --> 39:00.717
Never controlling.
She wanted me to go out whenever I wanted.

39:01.550 --> 39:02.930
To be free.

39:05.012 --> 39:06.932
She believed I could do anything.

39:08.307 --> 39:11.057
That we wouldn't fall
into the patterns that everyone else did.

39:17.107 --> 39:18.647
Sounds cliche, but...

39:22.654 --> 39:23.954
it empowered me.

39:25.532 --> 39:27.832
[Jean]
Maybe not you in the literal sense.

39:27.910 --> 39:30.700
But the part of me that's like you...

39:31.079 --> 39:33.169
just couldn't handle marriage.

39:34.330 --> 39:37.710
I wanted to explore, to wander.

39:38.420 --> 39:40.090
To not be stuck.

39:42.799 --> 39:45.389
You know, you don't live according
to the same rules

39:45.469 --> 39:48.099
as basically anyone I know.

39:51.767 --> 39:55.307
And I don't know what it is about you,
but you have this...

39:56.394 --> 40:00.024
intangible quality that I can't place.

40:04.947 --> 40:06.277
That reminds me of me.

40:08.784 --> 40:10.294
Or how I used to be.

40:16.583 --> 40:18.093
[inhales deeply]

40:18.502 --> 40:20.712
Anyway, I don't know.

40:21.421 --> 40:25.681
I guess I just couldn't bring myself
to commit to one thing for my whole life.

40:28.971 --> 40:32.101
I don't think everyone is built that way.

40:34.434 --> 40:36.444
[Michael] We talked about getting engaged.

40:38.730 --> 40:40.360
Started making plans.

40:42.734 --> 40:45.284
But the closer it came, the more she ran.

40:46.527 --> 40:48.527
It was a really bad period.

40:49.032 --> 40:52.662
I could just feel it.
She slowly checked out.

40:54.913 --> 40:59.133
I think that she was afraid that I was
gonna somehow take her life from her.

41:01.167 --> 41:02.247
[Michael] Her joy.

41:04.047 --> 41:05.377
Freedom.

41:07.384 --> 41:11.434
And once we got back together for real,
she committed.

41:12.556 --> 41:14.806
I knew she needed me to be...

41:17.477 --> 41:18.847
stable.

41:20.186 --> 41:22.476
She needed me to be...

41:25.652 --> 41:28.912
this, and I did it.

41:38.582 --> 41:40.042
I needed her.

41:43.879 --> 41:45.209
I need her.

41:46.798 --> 41:49.638
[Michael] She seems so strong
on the outside, but underneath...

41:50.219 --> 41:51.889
I'm not sure she has any...

41:55.057 --> 41:56.637
real control.

42:03.232 --> 42:04.692
And it's hard.

42:07.694 --> 42:09.404
It limits you.

42:10.986 --> 42:14.026
Having to be so strong
for someone else.

42:15.744 --> 42:16.914
Everyone else.

42:22.835 --> 42:24.955
I don't know if it's the weed or...

42:30.884 --> 42:33.014
it's just in this moment...

42:37.391 --> 42:39.941
I feel like I can see myself.

42:41.019 --> 42:42.269
With you.

42:44.481 --> 42:46.441
[doorbell buzzes]

42:49.236 --> 42:50.606
Pizza. Hold on.

44:00.599 --> 44:01.849
[door opens]

44:11.610 --> 44:13.490
I totally have the munchies.

44:22.788 --> 44:24.288
Can I ask you something?

44:27.709 --> 44:29.039
Come sit over here.

44:31.964 --> 44:33.134
Um...

44:34.383 --> 44:36.593
Did you send this to me on purpose?

44:38.262 --> 44:39.182
No.

44:39.263 --> 44:41.603
When you sent me all the pictures
from Dolly's party?

44:43.892 --> 44:45.522
I don't know what you mean.

44:47.062 --> 44:48.612
[slowly] Okay.

44:49.022 --> 44:50.612
[laughing] Oh...

44:53.026 --> 44:55.066
-Um...
-[Michael] No.

44:55.651 --> 44:57.441
What if I did send it on purpose?

44:58.824 --> 45:00.334
What are you gonna do about it?

45:12.087 --> 45:13.587
[Jean] What do you think you're doing?

45:16.216 --> 45:17.046
What?

45:21.096 --> 45:22.926
I'm not gonna let you fuck with me.

45:25.392 --> 45:26.232
You hear me?

45:27.561 --> 45:29.811
Everyone else and everything else...

45:35.360 --> 45:36.740
This is different for me.

45:40.738 --> 45:42.358
And I think it might be for you, too.

45:44.036 --> 45:45.826
The rules really don't apply.

46:19.071 --> 46:20.491
I think...

46:22.533 --> 46:26.253
you want this
as much as I do, Michael.

46:38.590 --> 46:41.090
I think we've both had a lot
to drink tonight.

46:42.344 --> 46:43.724
And, uh...

46:43.804 --> 46:46.394
And we should
probably get some rest, right?

47:34.309 --> 47:37.479
[breathing heavily]

48:13.560 --> 48:15.940
[both breathing heavily]

48:41.922 --> 48:44.592
[moaning]

49:03.151 --> 49:05.531
[moaning continues]

49:52.701 --> 49:54.121
[phone chimes]

50:17.976 --> 50:20.516
-[train approaching]
-[brakes screeching]

50:20.604 --> 50:23.904
[train rumbling]
