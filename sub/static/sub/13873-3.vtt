WEBVTT

00:05.939 --> 00:07.031
Spacecataz.

00:07.073 --> 00:08.734
Observe our peninsula
of masculinity.

00:08.775 --> 00:09.833
You love it.

00:09.876 --> 00:11.468
What are they doing over there?

00:11.511 --> 00:13.411
Hey, look, we're getting
a transmission from their ship.

00:13.446 --> 00:16.210
- Observe the digital dong.
- Check it out!

00:16.248 --> 00:17.682
That's right, I'm male.

00:17.717 --> 00:19.708
Your dongs are small
and useless!

00:19.753 --> 00:21.653
You know, we should
probably get going.

00:21.688 --> 00:23.451
I mean,
this is how fights start.

00:23.490 --> 00:26.459
This is not a fight.
This is a war!

00:27.827 --> 00:29.727
Suck on that!

00:29.763 --> 00:31.060
What was that?

00:31.097 --> 00:34.760
<i>My name is Shake-zula</i>

00:34.801 --> 00:37.065
<i>The mike ruler,
the old schooler</i>

00:37.103 --> 00:38.968
<i>You want to trip?
I'll bring it to ya</i>

00:39.005 --> 00:42.304
<i>Frylock, and I'm on top,
rock you like a cop</i>

00:42.342 --> 00:44.970
<i>Meatwad, you're up next,
with your knock-knock</i>

00:45.011 --> 00:47.343
<i>Meatwad make the money, see?</i>

00:47.380 --> 00:49.814
<i>Meatwad get the honeys, G</i>

00:49.849 --> 00:52.750
<i>Drivin' in my car,
livin' like a star</i>

00:52.786 --> 00:54.481
<i>Ice on my fingers
and my toes</i>

00:54.521 --> 00:55.783
<i>And I'm a Taurus</i>

00:55.822 --> 00:58.313
<i>Uh, check-check it, yeah</i>

00:58.358 --> 01:00.349
<i>'Cause we are the Aqua Teens</i>

01:00.393 --> 01:01.985
<i>Make the homeys say ho</i>

01:02.028 --> 01:04.053
<i>And the girlies
want to scream</i>

01:04.096 --> 01:06.327
<i>'Cause we are
the Aqua Teens</i>

01:06.366 --> 01:07.560
<i>Make the homeys say ho</i>

01:07.600 --> 01:09.397
<i>And the girlies
want to scream</i>

01:09.436 --> 01:11.301
<i>Aqua Teen Hunger Force</i>

01:11.337 --> 01:13.805
<i>Number one in the hood, G</i>

01:17.577 --> 01:20.102
Observe, Err, the digital nads.

01:20.146 --> 01:22.979
The principal
will resent his nads...

01:23.016 --> 01:25.780
being presented
in such a crude manner.

01:25.819 --> 01:27.309
You're not painting
on no school.

01:27.353 --> 01:28.752
That's a damn rock.

01:28.788 --> 01:30.050
- Well...
- And I like to rock.

01:30.090 --> 01:32.081
<i>I will rock your face</i>

01:34.094 --> 01:36.392
- We are bored.
- Yeah, I'm bored.

01:37.831 --> 01:38.923
Hey, let's go see
your Uncle Cliff.

01:38.965 --> 01:41.263
- Cliff is a roofer.
- We can "F" with him all day.

01:41.301 --> 01:43.792
- Cliff is highly confused.
- Confused enormaton.

01:43.837 --> 01:46.601
Let's challenge
his shattered view of the world.

01:48.775 --> 01:49.833
Hey, Cliff.

01:52.278 --> 01:55.270
- Boo.
- Aaagh!

01:55.315 --> 01:56.748
Is he all right?

01:56.783 --> 01:59.684
Cliff hasn't been all right
since the Lunar War.

01:59.719 --> 02:01.482
Boo!

02:01.521 --> 02:03.045
Boo! Boo! Boo! Boo!

02:03.089 --> 02:04.113
Hey, Cliff, look!

02:04.157 --> 02:05.590
Hey, Cliff, Cliff,
Cliff, Cliff!

02:05.625 --> 02:08.287
That's enough, Err. Look.

02:08.328 --> 02:10.228
What the "F" is that?

02:10.263 --> 02:13.164
It's Cliff's check from
the government for being crazy.

02:13.199 --> 02:14.723
Holy damn, look at that.

02:14.767 --> 02:17.065
Come, we shall acquire it
without permission from Cliff.

02:17.103 --> 02:18.229
We must steal it.

02:18.271 --> 02:22.230
And blow it...
over there.

02:22.275 --> 02:25.005
Stay, Cliff, and everything
will be all right.

02:30.884 --> 02:33.512
All right! That was incred...

02:33.553 --> 02:35.453
you know you were in there
for almost five minutes?!

02:35.488 --> 02:38.286
You're gonna win, and you're
gonna get in that book!

02:38.324 --> 02:41.225
Man, the pressure on my eyes
was indescribable.

02:41.261 --> 02:43.559
Yeah, but that was easy.
We just did a thaw.

02:43.596 --> 02:45.996
- That was only on fish.
- I'm ready for poultry.

02:46.032 --> 02:48.364
No. You're not. But you will
improve with practice...

02:48.401 --> 02:49.629
so there's still hope.

02:49.669 --> 02:52.194
This time, you're gonna
be in there a while.

02:52.238 --> 02:54.103
So, maybe you should get
some reading material, OK.

02:54.140 --> 02:56.608
Ooh, here!
Read this box of foil.

02:56.643 --> 02:59.908
"Do not use
in microwave oven... "

03:04.117 --> 03:05.277
Phew!

03:05.318 --> 03:07.684
Getting hot in here.

03:07.720 --> 03:08.744
Phew!

03:08.788 --> 03:11.222
- Uh, Shake?
- What?! I am busy!

03:11.257 --> 03:15.193
- Are you using the microwave?
- No! Do we have one?

03:15.228 --> 03:17.025
I never...
what is that thing?

03:17.063 --> 03:20.191
Just so you know, I reversed
the rays on that microwave...

03:20.233 --> 03:22.531
just in case you decided to put
one of our roommates in there.

03:22.569 --> 03:25.163
That's so ridiculous, I can't
even talk to you right now.

03:25.205 --> 03:26.570
What would make you think...

03:26.606 --> 03:28.471
that I'd ever want
to even do anything like that?!

03:28.508 --> 03:31.238
I found these
crudely drawn plans.

03:31.277 --> 03:32.437
So, uh, phew!

03:32.478 --> 03:33.706
Ho!

03:33.746 --> 03:35.577
Why is the...
why is the kitchen... hey?

03:35.615 --> 03:37.082
Did you not hear
a word I just said...

03:37.116 --> 03:38.640
about reversing the rays
on the microwave?

03:38.685 --> 03:40.346
Thanks a lot! Thanks a lot!

03:40.386 --> 03:43.150
I got my energy drinks in there!
They're all ruined!

03:43.189 --> 03:45.214
Now I'm gonna be
worn out all day!

03:45.258 --> 03:48.785
I got no carbs,
no electrolytes.

03:48.828 --> 03:51.023
I needed that boost, man!

03:51.064 --> 03:53.726
Ah, it feels good
to stretch my legs.

03:53.766 --> 03:57.133
Boy, I haven't bitch-slapped
someone since Tucson.

03:57.170 --> 03:58.228
Bend over, slaves!

03:58.271 --> 04:01.434
Prepare for
a pride-obliterating bitch-slap.

04:01.474 --> 04:04.341
All right! We went... damn it!
What the hell's your problem?

04:04.377 --> 04:06.368
Come on, now, you know
how this is gonna end.

04:06.412 --> 04:08.539
We will decide your fate,
Fry man...

04:08.581 --> 04:10.845
and the fate of
the entire galaxy.

04:10.883 --> 04:11.907
As soon as you...

04:11.951 --> 04:13.919
could you pa...
cash my paycheck?

04:13.953 --> 04:16.512
Here's two forms of I.D.
Suck them both!

04:16.555 --> 04:18.649
Would you mind?
And you'll do it.

04:18.690 --> 04:20.386
You think if we had money
we'd live here?

04:20.426 --> 04:24.157
I hate to say it, but, uh,
Red Box over here has a point.

04:24.197 --> 04:26.927
My allowance has been
seriously cut back...

04:26.966 --> 04:29.434
'cause I am not responsible
with money.

04:29.469 --> 04:31.528
You should consider
a Roth I.R.A.

04:31.571 --> 04:34.301
Did I hear a ding?
Get back in the magic house!

04:34.340 --> 04:37.537
- U.S.A.! U.S.A.!
- U.S.A.!

04:37.577 --> 04:38.908
- U.S.A.!
- Back in the box!

04:38.945 --> 04:39.969
U.S.A.!

04:40.013 --> 04:41.981
Uhh. Rookies.

04:42.015 --> 04:44.074
Look, why don't you try
a check-cashing place?

04:44.117 --> 04:47.416
We don't just try to do
what earthlings tell us.

04:47.453 --> 04:49.785
But, um,
where would it be located?

04:49.822 --> 04:53.519
If we were to stoop so low as to
get your pathetic directions.

04:53.559 --> 04:55.891
You're punishment
is to write those down...

04:55.928 --> 04:59.694
for suggesting anything to us...
now and forever.

04:59.732 --> 05:02.257
In a post-apocalyptic world...

05:02.302 --> 05:04.930
one man is transported
from the microwave dimension...

05:04.971 --> 05:08.600
to feast upon the remains
of those who once lived.

05:08.641 --> 05:09.767
Rated R.

05:09.809 --> 05:11.572
Will you shut up?
You're not that guy!

05:11.611 --> 05:13.636
I'm telling you,
that'd make a good movie.

05:13.680 --> 05:15.944
Yeah, a good movie.
Break their friggin' projector.

05:15.982 --> 05:18.075
Do what you do best...
act stupid and follow me.

05:18.117 --> 05:20.677
- Now, come on.
- Yes, everyone...

05:20.720 --> 05:24.053
but not to
the check-cashing place.

05:24.090 --> 05:25.717
What do you mean, no?

05:25.758 --> 05:28.659
Don't you know how much
this is for, 'cause I do not!

05:28.695 --> 05:30.560
Look, we don't cash checks here.

05:30.596 --> 05:32.063
And we don't respond to threats.

05:32.098 --> 05:34.123
I'll say it one more time
in a little language...

05:34.167 --> 05:35.862
I like to call English...

05:35.902 --> 05:38.393
<i>or maybe I should say it
in mejicani!</i>

05:38.438 --> 05:41.771
Get back there-o and cash-o
the check-o, amigo!

05:41.808 --> 05:42.968
Andale, andale!

05:43.009 --> 05:45.136
- He's not responding, cup.
- Lay into him more.

05:45.178 --> 05:47.408
- Lay into him some more.
- I've got this, Err!

05:47.447 --> 05:49.506
That thing there is your check?

05:49.549 --> 05:52.814
- Yeah, that's the check.
- Well, we don't cash 'em.

05:52.852 --> 05:55.286
Oh, you never seen
a check before?

05:55.321 --> 05:59.382
Oh, me so sorry! Maybe you're
in the wrong business.

05:59.425 --> 06:02.189
And maybe Immigration
would like to know about this.

06:02.228 --> 06:04.128
Good, 'cause you know what?
I'm American!

06:04.163 --> 06:06.791
Well, I'm not!
But when I become one...

06:06.833 --> 06:10.166
maybe then I'll legally
buy a weapon...

06:10.203 --> 06:14.731
and we won't have to vote you
out of office, lowly scumbag!

06:14.774 --> 06:17.072
- Unbelievable!
- Unfathomable.

06:17.110 --> 06:20.204
You know, they sneak in,
and then they try to rule us.

06:20.246 --> 06:22.111
Well, I'm gonna sneak
into your country...

06:22.148 --> 06:23.615
and do this job there...

06:23.649 --> 06:26.174
and then not cash
any of your friggin' checks!

06:26.219 --> 06:27.379
How will you like that?!

06:27.420 --> 06:30.389
You won't,
because you'll be here!

06:30.423 --> 06:31.947
Your logic is flawless...

06:31.991 --> 06:34.551
but my brain has transmitted
a better idea.

06:34.594 --> 06:36.118
What's in it for me?

06:36.162 --> 06:39.063
Do you see that tiny
pathetic star up there?

06:39.098 --> 06:41.089
- That's in it for you.
- All yours.

06:41.134 --> 06:42.829
Which one?
What are you talking about?

06:42.869 --> 06:43.961
Oh, I think you see it.

06:44.003 --> 06:45.368
You couldn't see anything
without it.

06:45.405 --> 06:47.066
It's called the Sun.

06:47.106 --> 06:48.300
Maybe you've heard of it, fatty.

06:48.341 --> 06:52.505
Are you serious? You own that?!
No frickin' way!

06:52.545 --> 06:54.604
But it could be called
the "Carl"...

06:54.647 --> 06:56.877
If you play your cards
correctly.

06:56.916 --> 06:58.577
Wait, hang on, I'm getting
ahead of myself here.

06:58.618 --> 07:00.711
This isn't true, is it?
You don't own it, do you?

07:00.753 --> 07:02.721
We could.

07:02.755 --> 07:04.586
Right now
we don't feel like it.

07:04.624 --> 07:06.148
Carlito wants his hand back.

07:06.192 --> 07:07.591
All right, well, you know...

07:07.627 --> 07:09.151
I gotta have something
I can use.

07:09.195 --> 07:10.219
Yeah, right.

07:10.263 --> 07:11.560
- Give me that laser gun.
- No, Carl.

07:11.597 --> 07:14.293
- You give me that.
- Carl, Carl, Carl...

07:14.333 --> 07:16.392
you'd just go out of control
with a laser gun.

07:16.436 --> 07:19.269
He is correct,
but we can offer you this...

07:19.305 --> 07:22.103
cash our check,
and you will get...

07:22.141 --> 07:23.631
immortal.

07:23.676 --> 07:25.405
Never-ending life.

07:25.445 --> 07:28.380
Nah. Sometimes
I kind of want to die.

07:28.414 --> 07:30.974
How 'bout we do...

07:31.017 --> 07:32.746
uh... going rate 6%%%?

07:32.785 --> 07:34.082
What the...

07:34.120 --> 07:35.712
Hey, that's how they
frickin' do it at the docks.

07:35.755 --> 07:37.052
- that, fatty!
- Aah!

07:37.089 --> 07:38.283
Here comes the pain!

07:38.324 --> 07:40.053
Chill, Err, chill.

07:40.092 --> 07:42.253
Oh, shoot.

07:42.295 --> 07:44.195
I guess I was too late.

07:45.431 --> 07:47.092
Get his wallet.

07:47.133 --> 07:49.829
You... shave him.

07:49.869 --> 07:51.359
And as you can see...

07:51.404 --> 07:53.338
that's my proper identification.

07:53.372 --> 07:54.839
It all checks out.

07:54.874 --> 07:57.138
You will notice
a difference in height.

07:57.176 --> 07:58.643
That's because
I'm an organ donor...

07:58.678 --> 08:01.670
I had to have my body removed
last year and donated.

08:01.714 --> 08:03.648
I certainly hope
you don't discriminate here.

08:03.683 --> 08:05.583
No, uh, Mister, uh...

08:05.618 --> 08:07.108
Meatwad.

08:07.153 --> 08:08.780
It... it doesn't
say that on here.

08:08.821 --> 08:10.254
- What does it say?
- Carl.

08:10.289 --> 08:11.586
Yeah, that's his I.D.

08:11.624 --> 08:14.821
What are you doing?!
What's taking so long?! God!

08:16.729 --> 08:18.390
So, I'll be taking
my money now.

08:18.431 --> 08:19.921
Well, you know what?
It doesn't even matter.

08:19.966 --> 08:22.161
I don't even cash checks here.
Definitely not that one.

08:22.201 --> 08:23.361
Lay into him!

08:23.402 --> 08:25.563
Hey, quick question.

08:25.605 --> 08:27.368
- Is them pennies?
- Yeah.

08:27.406 --> 08:30.375
And you're just giving 'em out?
How much is gum?

08:31.410 --> 08:33.934
- What happened? Did he buy it?
- I bought me some gum.

08:33.980 --> 08:35.413
- Where did you get gum?
- Where did you get gum?

08:35.448 --> 08:37.813
- In there. In the gum aisle.
- Perfect.

08:37.850 --> 08:39.647
That's not what
we sent you in there for!

08:39.684 --> 08:41.015
But that's what I come out with.

08:41.053 --> 08:43.248
Tell me.
Were there weenie wraps?

08:43.289 --> 08:46.315
Microwavable.
But weenie wraps nonetheless.

08:46.359 --> 08:47.417
- Oh.
- Mmm!

08:47.460 --> 08:48.688
Weenie wraps intrigue me.

08:48.728 --> 08:50.389
Yep. And they had burger drops.

08:50.429 --> 08:52.556
- Burger drops?!
- And burrito cakes.

08:52.598 --> 08:54.122
I thought they stopped
making those.

08:54.166 --> 08:56.259
- And pizza balls.
- Pizza balls?!

08:56.302 --> 08:58.065
Were there lil' turkey muffins?

08:58.104 --> 09:00.800
They had lil', regular, and max.

09:00.840 --> 09:03.832
Seize all pennies at once!
Purchase all pizza balls...

09:03.876 --> 09:05.503
and max...
oh, there you are.

09:05.545 --> 09:07.604
You take this,
and we'd better go.

09:07.647 --> 09:10.047
I want them out of here.
I do not like them.

09:10.082 --> 09:11.879
But look at that check.
We're gonna cash it.

09:11.918 --> 09:14.944
We're all gonna take our piece,
and then they'll be gone.

09:14.987 --> 09:16.852
And this is the check?

09:16.889 --> 09:20.120
Yes! It's huge!
We could live off it forever.

09:20.159 --> 09:21.786
You haven't touched this,
have you, Shake?

09:21.827 --> 09:23.522
No! Well, yeah.

09:23.563 --> 09:25.087
I've been hauling it
all over town.

09:25.131 --> 09:27.395
Yeah, and I'm Carl.
Nice to meet you.

09:27.433 --> 09:28.695
It's emitting radiation.

09:28.734 --> 09:30.759
Yeah, but, like, you know,
the good kind, right?

09:30.803 --> 09:32.395
Like how they find tumors...

09:32.438 --> 09:34.565
and gave Spider-Man
his powers and stuff.

09:34.607 --> 09:36.074
No, Shake, the bad kind.

09:36.108 --> 09:38.133
The other kind.
The kidney-losing kind.

09:38.177 --> 09:40.441
In fact, this is not
a check at all, Shake.

09:40.479 --> 09:42.208
This is a bill...
for homecare.

09:42.248 --> 09:44.079
Impossible. That's not a bill.

09:44.116 --> 09:46.380
Uh, Cliff?
Does anyone know a Cliff?

09:46.419 --> 09:48.683
Yes, my name is Cliff.
And that's not a bill.

09:48.721 --> 09:50.120
- Tell him, Err.
- That's a bill.

09:50.156 --> 09:53.387
A bi... why are we trying
to cash a bill, Err?

09:53.426 --> 09:54.950
Hell, I don't know.
It's your uncle!

09:54.994 --> 09:56.222
I kept telling you
on the way down here!

09:56.262 --> 09:58.662
It is my uncle.
Don't you forget it.

09:58.698 --> 10:00.359
On the way down, I kept saying,
"This is a bill".

10:00.399 --> 10:02.026
I just figured
you knew something I didn't.

10:02.068 --> 10:04.036
I did know something I didn't...

10:04.070 --> 10:05.537
but it wasn't that.

10:05.571 --> 10:08.540
Wait a minute! I've been hauling
a radioactive bill...

10:08.574 --> 10:10.872
all over town for you guys?

10:10.910 --> 10:11.934
- Yes, cup.
- Yeah.

10:11.978 --> 10:13.240
And now you will pay it.

10:13.279 --> 10:15.144
Y'all have a microwave?
I gotta heat these up.

10:15.181 --> 10:18.912
Hmm. I guess it emits radiation
when it's due.

10:18.951 --> 10:20.509
And it's two months past due.

10:20.553 --> 10:23.021
Oh, look at my hands.
Oh, the hands!

10:23.055 --> 10:24.420
Look at those hands.

10:24.457 --> 10:26.186
Uh, someone should probably
pay that bill.

10:26.225 --> 10:27.692
Jeez! It's getting hot in here.

10:27.727 --> 10:29.285
This weenie wrap
is still frozen!

10:29.328 --> 10:31.694
- Your microwave sucks.
- Hey, your microwave sucks!

10:31.731 --> 10:32.755
Aw, hell.

10:32.798 --> 10:33.890
It's getting hot in here.

10:33.933 --> 10:35.230
Why is it getting
so hot in here?!

10:35.267 --> 10:38.532
- Run!
- Aah!

10:38.571 --> 10:40.266
Oh, jeez.

10:40.306 --> 10:42.399
Hey, hey, cue ball! Wake up.

10:42.441 --> 10:44.170
Shouldn't drink during the day,
you know.

10:44.210 --> 10:46.542
Friggin'...
oh. My hair. My hair!

10:46.579 --> 10:49.013
Where's my hair?!
Where's my 'stache!

10:49.048 --> 10:50.538
Oh, you can
have it back now, Carl.

10:50.583 --> 10:53.313
It's itchy. And it makes me
look a little tutti-frutti.

10:53.352 --> 10:54.785
- Ho ho ho, funny.
- Well, Carl, actually...

10:54.820 --> 10:56.685
you know, I think you look
younger without it.

10:56.722 --> 10:58.189
Yeah. No, I get your vibe.

10:58.224 --> 11:01.057
By "younger," you mean gay.
I'm gay-looking.

11:01.093 --> 11:03.186
Whatever. Do what you want.
I don't care.

11:03.229 --> 11:05.527
Try this on for size, Fry man.

11:05.564 --> 11:08.863
Or for 59 cents more,
try the super size!

11:08.901 --> 11:09.959
Man, I feel weird.

11:10.002 --> 11:12.129
Quiet, Err.
I'm transmitting rage.

11:12.171 --> 11:14.162
<i>Dancing is forbidden</i>

11:14.206 --> 11:17.175
<i>Dancing is forbidden</i>

11:17.209 --> 11:19.973
<i>Dancing is forbidden</i>

11:20.012 --> 11:22.640
<i>Dancing is forbidden</i>

11:22.682 --> 11:24.673
<i>Dancing is forbidden</i>
