I'm sure I've met her before.

00:42.709 --> 00:45.210
I'll introduce myself to her.
That'll get her to say it.

00:45.211 --> 00:48.630
Hi. I'm Chris.

all that closely.

02:02.581 --> 02:04.249

Um, sure.

Rope a doggy for me.

02:22.434 --> 02:24.978
Oh, awesome. Look over there.
You can take a selfie

to get social media attention.

02:30.734 --> 02:34.654
"Don't really want to get

Oh, boy. Well, this is
the last thing I wanted.

02:43.414 --> 02:46.874
I'm gonna do a Instagram story
here where I insult a loner

02:46.875 --> 02:49.419
and it becomes a whole thing.

02:49.420 --> 02:53.965
What's up, everybody?
I'm here at Streaming-Con 2019.

02:53.966 --> 02:56.467
Weird ponytail.

02:56.468 --> 02:58.886
They got a whole booth
of cat GIFs here.

02:58.887 --> 03:00.513
Jiff?

03:00.514 --> 03:03.308
How-how do you say... Uh-oh.

03:03.309 --> 03:05.852
Hey, man, I didn't say anything
to that guy.

03:05.853 --> 03:08.062
This is ridiculous.
You're hurting my wrist!

03:08.063 --> 03:09.147
So check this out, guys.

03:09.148 --> 03:11.316
I got kicked out
of Streaming-Con 2019.

03:11.317 --> 03:13.693
Now, I don't know if anyone
watching this is a lawyer,

03:13.694 --> 03:15.653

a constitutional lawyer,

03:15.654 --> 03:16.946

Hey, guys,
so I'm in my own trunk.

I'm gonna get murdered.

03:21.952 --> 03:23.619
Uh, but before I do, I forgot,

03:23.620 --> 03:25.079
I'm supposed
to mention Triscuits.

03:25.080 --> 03:26.706
Really,
all the Nabisco products,

03:26.707 --> 03:27.832
they're-they're solid.

03:27.833 --> 03:29.208
You know, like,
on the back of Triscuits

03:29.209 --> 03:31.210
when they give you
the recipes for those snacks?

03:31.211 --> 03:32.628
Like, the-the mini pizzas?

03:32.629 --> 03:34.756
I swear to God,
make those little pizzas.

04:08.957 --> 04:11.418

04:12.878 --> 04:15.755

05:39.131 --> 05:42.300
I say we celebrate
by eating Triscuit pizzas.

05:42.301 --> 05:44.677
- Is it good?
- The recipe's right on the box.

05:44.678 --> 05:46.471
- Yeah, but is it good?
- You can make them

05:46.472 --> 05:49.015
with ingredients you probably
already have in the house.

05:49.016 --> 05:52.393
- Dad, what does it taste like?
- That's right.

05:52.394 --> 05:55.605
Ugh! It's like I dropped
a tomato in some hay.

05:55.606 --> 05:58.107
Yeah, it's like
if a horse made a pizza.

05:58.108 --> 06:01.445
Triscuits: make sure
you have a drink nearby.

06:06.950 --> 06:08.951
All right, Meg, now that
you're an Internet personality,

06:08.952 --> 06:10.578
we got to build your brand.

06:10.579 --> 06:11.954
Is there anything you can do?

06:11.955 --> 06:13.706
Uh, yeah, actually, I can...

06:17.586 --> 06:19.921
I-Is...

06:19.922 --> 06:22.715
Is there anything you can do
in front of your dad?

06:22.716 --> 06:24.842
- I can shuffle a deck of cards.
- Oh, good.

06:24.843 --> 06:26.177

06:28.639 --> 06:32.017
All right, we're taking your
bedroom door off the hinges.

06:34.269 --> 06:36.687
Is the lady who owns
the Prius here?

06:36.688 --> 06:39.732
-Uh, actually, that's me.
-Oh, well, your wife's car
is totaled.

06:39.733 --> 06:41.400
- It's my car.
- Sorry.

06:41.401 --> 06:43.903
We were, however,
able to save your purse.

06:43.904 --> 06:46.197
It's a gender-fluid
Euro carrier.

06:46.198 --> 06:48.616
Either way, we'll have it towed
back to San Francisco.

06:48.617 --> 06:51.244
Hey, there are plenty of closer
gay cities, you big ape.

06:51.245 --> 06:52.828

06:52.829 --> 06:54.372
You're gonna need a loaner.

06:54.373 --> 06:57.166
We have a pink Volkswagen Beetle

06:57.167 --> 06:59.544
Ooh, Brian,
we could be two in the pink!

06:59.545 --> 07:01.087
Take that one! Take that one!

07:01.088 --> 07:02.421
Yeah, I'm thinking
of something sportier.

07:02.422 --> 07:05.633
- The red Miata it is.
- Give me your manliest car!

07:05.634 --> 07:07.009
Bill, I need a Hummer.

07:07.010 --> 07:09.512

what we've got in here.

07:49.219 --> 07:52.513

07:52.514 --> 07:54.056
Boom! Mini cream!

07:54.057 --> 07:56.434
Oh, and what's this?
Strawberry yogurt?

07:56.435 --> 07:58.853
Is-is your girl Meg
some kind of health nut?

07:58.854 --> 08:02.941
No, turn it around:
35 grams of sugar!

08:04.776 --> 08:06.611
Yeah, through the roof!

08:06.612 --> 08:08.487
Check it, check it, what's this?

08:08.488 --> 08:10.615
A bacon drawer? Stacked.

08:10.616 --> 08:13.242
Rashers on rashers.
Best part about these bad boys?

08:13.243 --> 08:15.369
Don't even have to cook them.

08:15.370 --> 08:17.914
Cook them right in your stomach!

08:19.249 --> 08:21.710
Wash it down
with a little cream!

08:29.217 --> 08:32.011
Oh, boy, that's-that's going
right through me.

08:36.099 --> 08:39.434

08:39.436 --> 08:42.063

it's not cream!

08:43.982 --> 08:45.983

- You can't use the Charmin.

09:01.416 --> 09:03.042
Mom, we've got a problem.

09:03.043 --> 09:05.544
See, I-I promoted Magic Shell
ice cream topping on my channel,

09:05.545 --> 09:08.214
- so-so they sent me a ton of it.
- Yeah, so?

09:08.215 --> 09:10.258
Dad Han Solo'd himself.

09:11.301 --> 09:13.762
Oh, my God,
he's gonna suffocate.

09:19.017 --> 09:22.979
I created a vanilla ice cream
Peter covered in Magic Shell.

09:22.980 --> 09:25.564
- Why?
- Because I must.

09:25.565 --> 09:27.608
Don't listen to him.
He's an imposter.

09:27.609 --> 09:29.276
- I'm the real Peter.
- No, you're not.

09:29.277 --> 09:31.112
I made you.
I'm the real Peter.

09:31.113 --> 09:33.447
Oh-oh, my God, I-I don't know
which one to believe.

09:33.448 --> 09:36.575
What do you mean?
I'm a guy, and he's ice cream.

09:40.038 --> 09:42.248
Thank God, Lois.

11:02.412 --> 11:04.371
Nothing. When you have
a million followers,

11:04.372 --> 11:05.873
people just pay you to hang out.

11:05.874 --> 11:09.210

11:09.211 --> 11:12.714

11:51.461 --> 11:54.214

Internet star Meg Griffin

12:42.053 --> 12:43.721

13:25.221 --> 13:26.513
Pancresta.

13:26.514 --> 13:29.601
Makes opiates look like
baby aspirin.

13:31.937 --> 13:34.897
Meg, like everyone
who doesn't have diabetes,

13:34.898 --> 13:36.440
I'm not sure how it works,

13:36.441 --> 13:38.108
but I do know
you could go blind,

13:38.109 --> 13:41.153
you could have organ failure,
you could lose your feet.

13:41.154 --> 13:43.572
No amount of fame is worth this.

13:43.573 --> 13:45.616

You know, I think you like
driving this Hummer.

14:07.347 --> 14:08.889
You're a Hummer guy.

14:08.890 --> 14:11.767
I'm not a Hummer guy, Stewie.
I'm a responsible Prius driver

14:11.768 --> 14:13.978

of a bad situation.

14:13.979 --> 14:15.562

I also didn't ask for these

The way you're
touching, feeding,

15:44.986 --> 15:48.280
- and talking to your car.
- His name is Mark McGrath.

15:48.281 --> 15:49.948
What's happened to you?

15:49.949 --> 15:53.077
I-I don't know. All I know
is I love this Hummer.

15:53.078 --> 15:54.620
God, the power.

15:54.621 --> 15:56.413
I deserved a sweet ride
for a little while.

15:56.414 --> 15:57.998
It felt so good.

15:57.999 --> 16:00.501

16:03.671 --> 16:06.256
-How much creatine...
-I've been doing
a lot of creatine!

16:06.257 --> 16:08.092
All set.

16:08.093 --> 16:11.678
You can probably get another
130,000 miles out of this thing.

16:11.679 --> 16:13.972
Well, let's see--
I drive about 4,000 a year,

16:13.973 --> 16:16.016
so when this car goes,
I'll be...

16:16.017 --> 16:17.435
Dead for 18 years.

16:18.561 --> 16:20.647
Let me just say goodbye
to the Hummer.

16:22.482 --> 16:24.733
I'll miss you, Mark McGrath.

16:24.734 --> 16:26.902
I'll miss scaring the hell
out of homeless people

16:26.903 --> 16:29.655
with your cruise-ship-grade
air horn.

16:29.656 --> 16:31.323
I'll miss catching
the eye of women

16:31.324 --> 16:34.077
smoking outside
of government buildings.

16:41.668 --> 16:44.545
But mostly, I'll miss driving
a military vehicle

16:44.546 --> 16:46.755
45 miles an hour
through a school zone

16:46.756 --> 16:49.007
to get Crest Whitestrips.

16:49.008 --> 16:52.344
The back side of this car
is all wrecked.

16:52.345 --> 16:53.846
Who fixed this thing, your wife?

16:53.847 --> 16:56.598
- No, she can't fix a car.
- That's my point.

16:56.599 --> 17:00.018
She passed away last month.
She was addicted to Pancresta,

17:00.019 --> 17:02.604
so she didn't so much
pass away as elevate

17:02.605 --> 17:04.897
to a higher level
of consciousness.

17:04.898 --> 17:08.609
Just turned into a smiling beam
of light right before my eyes.

17:08.611 --> 17:11.113
She told me to be at peace,
and I was.

17:11.114 --> 17:13.781
I'm hearing a lot of good stuff
about this Pancresta.

17:13.782 --> 17:15.576

17:24.627 --> 17:26.587
Besides, the Earth is on fire.

17:26.588 --> 17:29.173
One dog driving a Prius
won't fix that.
