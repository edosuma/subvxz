00:14.000 --> 00:15.100
Good evening.

00:15.166 --> 00:16.600
Police continue
to hunt for the murderers

00:16.666 --> 00:20.266
of an elderly couple found slain
in their home one month ago.

00:20.333 --> 00:23.200
Police believe there is no
connection to that case

00:23.266 --> 00:26.066
and the bizarre triple slaying
of three people

00:26.133 --> 00:28.200
found near that same location.

00:28.266 --> 00:31.466
In local news, two were killed
and four wounded

00:31.533 --> 00:35.300
when local bank robbers
began threatening hostages..

00:39.366 --> 00:40.300
What the..

00:53.666 --> 00:54.866
No, no, no.

00:54.933 --> 00:57.033
Don't be afraid.

00:58.733 --> 01:02.533
This time it isn't
one of your nightmares.

01:03.900 --> 01:07.233
This one...was mine.

01:20.800 --> 01:22.900
Where the hell are we?

01:24.800 --> 01:27.666
Uh, we're coming to you live
from outside

01:27.733 --> 01:29.933
the Springwood
Municipal Courthouse.

01:30.000 --> 01:32.600
Uh, this is the scene
of the pretrial hearing

01:32.666 --> 01:35.300
of accused mass murderer,
Fred Krueger.

01:35.366 --> 01:38.766
The hopes and the fears
of this terrorized community

01:38.833 --> 01:40.333
ride on the evidence
being presented

01:40.400 --> 01:42.333
by prosecutor Michael Deeks.

01:44.233 --> 01:46.133
'Victim number five'

01:46.200 --> 01:48.433
'eight-year-old
Virginia Cross.'

01:49.600 --> 01:52.100
'This is how she looked
when we found her.'

01:54.300 --> 01:57.633
'And her four-year-old brother,
Mike Cross.'

01:57.700 --> 02:00.000
'He was found
in this dumpster..'

02:00.066 --> 02:02.100
'...a block away from his home.'

02:04.033 --> 02:07.633
Victim number seven,
six-year-old Bobby Doyle.

02:07.700 --> 02:09.566
We were able to identify him

02:09.633 --> 02:10.966
through his dental records

02:26.866 --> 02:29.000
'Do you have
any closing remarks?'

02:29.066 --> 02:31.166
'Those slides
are the only remarks.'

02:31.233 --> 02:32.833
They speak for themselves.

02:32.900 --> 02:35.633
Save for the thanks that I
and this entire community have

02:35.700 --> 02:37.466
for a Lieutenant Blocker..

02:37.533 --> 02:40.600
...for finally apprehendin
this unholy aberration.

02:40.666 --> 02:43.666
- Objection, Your Honor!
- Excuse me.

02:43.733 --> 02:46.533
Allegedunholy abe

02:46.600 --> 02:48.000
'Let us not forget..'

02:48.066 --> 02:49.300
'...that had not
Lieutenant Blocker'

02:49.366 --> 02:51.400
'moved so quickly,
his own children'

02:51.466 --> 02:53.533
'would be pictures
on those slides'

02:53.600 --> 02:55.933
'rather than sitting
with their father here today.'

02:56.733 --> 02:58.466
That's all, Your Honor.

02:58.533 --> 03:00.500
Attorney for the defense,
do you wish to present

03:00.566 --> 03:02.600
evidence for admission?

03:04.333 --> 03:06.800
I do, Your Honor.

03:06.866 --> 03:08.733
I have but one exhibit.

03:11.633 --> 03:15.300
Due to new evidence, I've just
recently been made aware of..

03:15.366 --> 03:17.066
'...and move
for dismissal of the case.'

03:17.133 --> 03:19.366
- 'Dismissal?'
- I protest, Your Honor!

03:19.433 --> 03:21.266
You're out of order, Mr. Deeks.

03:21.333 --> 03:23.266
'Counsels, approach the bench.'

03:43.500 --> 03:45.766
The evidence
presented to this court

03:45.833 --> 03:49.400
was obtained
during an illegal arrest.

03:49.466 --> 03:52.400
Not in compliance
with the Supreme Court's ruling

03:52.466 --> 03:54.433
'on the rights of the accused.'

03:55.666 --> 03:58.000
'With great regret,
I must grant'

03:58.066 --> 04:00.533
defense's motion to dismiss.

04:00.600 --> 04:03.433
Your Honor, this man
cannot be allowed to walk free.

04:03.500 --> 04:05.566
Then he should have been
read his rights

04:05.633 --> 04:07.633
at the time of his arrest.

04:07.700 --> 04:12.066
I'm as sorry as you,
but the law is the law.

04:12.133 --> 04:16.400
If procedure had been followed&nbsp;
thiscouldn't have

04:17.466 --> 04:18.733
Court's adjourned.

04:31.966 --> 04:33.900
'What about our children?'

04:36.466 --> 04:37.833
'Excuse me. Excuse..'

05:22.700 --> 05:24.133
This is your fault!

05:24.200 --> 05:26.833
You screwed up
and now he's free!

05:26.900 --> 05:29.533
- Come on.
- It's on your head!

05:31.766 --> 05:32.700
Excuse me.

05:35.466 --> 05:36.900
Where the hell did he go?

05:36.966 --> 05:38.900
After more children.

05:41.300 --> 05:43.933
This isn't over.
Not by a long shot.

05:45.666 --> 05:49.666
Looking at those slides...
brings it all back.

05:49.733 --> 05:53.200
Two years of hunting,
chasing shadows..

05:53.266 --> 05:55.266
...and for what?

05:55.333 --> 05:58.866
Look at them.
Look at what he did to Merit.

05:58.933 --> 06:00.866
'She doesn't eat,
she doesn't sleep.'

06:00.933 --> 06:03.633
Nothing resembling
a normal life.

06:03.700 --> 06:06.866
He took it...
and I couldn't stop him.

06:06.933 --> 06:09.700
- Daddy?
- What, baby?

06:09.766 --> 06:11.333
Will Freddy be back?

06:15.900 --> 06:19.700
You know...
I almost shot him, Sarah.

06:20.866 --> 06:22.933
So help me when I saw him
near the girls

06:23.000 --> 06:24.333
'I almost pulled the trigger.'

06:24.400 --> 06:26.333
So what stopped you?

06:28.866 --> 06:30.966
I don't want to hear
about justice!

06:31.033 --> 06:34.166
That bastard took
my little girl.

06:34.233 --> 06:35.533
You know, Michael,
I had this funny idea

06:35.600 --> 06:37.333
that the law was designed
to protect us.

06:37.400 --> 06:39.233
I've given my life to the law.

06:39.300 --> 06:41.900
I've always believed in it...
until today.

06:41.966 --> 06:43.866
And if it fails like today

06:43.933 --> 06:46.133
Well, then,
it's our responsibility..

06:46.200 --> 06:47.433
...to be our own law.

06:47.500 --> 06:48.666
Now, wait a minute,
are you suggesting that we all

06:48.733 --> 06:50.133
become a lynch mob here,
Michael?

06:50.200 --> 06:51.833
I'm all for giving a man
a fair trial

06:51.900 --> 06:54.433
but our stinking system wouldn't
even let us get that far.

06:56.166 --> 06:58.400
We take it from here.

06:58.466 --> 06:59.633
Are you with me?

06:59.700 --> 07:01.966
Yeah.

07:02.033 --> 07:05.400
- Yeah. Yeah. Let's go!
- Come on, let's go.

07:08.200 --> 07:10.133
- 'Hey, over here.'
- 'Let's go.'

07:30.000 --> 07:33.166
Ah, together again.
Are you ready for Freddy?

08:51.433 --> 08:55.333
'Patience. Tonight we'll
have a little party. Ha ha.'

08:59.766 --> 09:03.233
'Time to feed you some meat.'

09:06.433 --> 09:09.366
'Oh, don't worry.'

09:09.433 --> 09:11.700
'There'll be plenty
to go around.'

09:40.033 --> 09:42.200
Freddy's home.

10:09.166 --> 10:10.433
'Tim.'

10:14.100 --> 10:16.500
Remember why we came here?

10:16.566 --> 10:19.133
Remember New York?

10:19.200 --> 10:21.733
Remember, uh,
18 locks on the door?

10:21.800 --> 10:24.100
Armed guards in schools?

10:24.166 --> 10:27.233
Pushers, junkies, bums

10:27.300 --> 10:28.900
everything imaginable
on the streets

10:28.966 --> 10:30.400
except decent people.

10:30.466 --> 10:32.233
'Sarah, don't.'

10:32.300 --> 10:34.866
Oh, but here we are in the land
of white picket fences

10:34.933 --> 10:38.466
and...and PTA meetings.

10:38.533 --> 10:40.566
Mostly what we wanted
was a decent life

10:40.633 --> 10:42.366
for us and the girls.

10:42.433 --> 10:44.400
You think I didn't want that?

10:45.466 --> 10:47.000
What, are you like them?

10:47.066 --> 10:49.033
'You think this is my fault?'

10:51.000 --> 10:54.766
All I'm saying is that maniac
is still loose on the streets.

10:54.833 --> 10:57.566
When I saw what he
was about to do to our girls..

10:57.633 --> 11:00.433
...I was too crazy to remember
every stupid procedural detail.

11:00.500 --> 11:03.133
I know, his rights.

11:03.200 --> 11:06.600
What about Lisa's rights?
What about Merit's rights?

11:06.666 --> 11:09.233
She hasn't been the same
since this happened.

11:11.233 --> 11:12.933
Where do you think you're going?

11:13.000 --> 11:16.000
The station...
to check security.

11:17.200 --> 11:18.500
You'll be okay.

11:18.566 --> 11:21.466
I'll send a man by
to keep watch.

11:21.533 --> 11:24.400
Daddy, you can't kill Freddy.

11:24.466 --> 11:26.400
You'll only make it worse.

12:13.200 --> 12:15.133
'Well, what about
A Street?'

12:16.300 --> 12:18.066
Alright.

12:18.133 --> 12:20.733
Okay. Thanks a lot. Bye.

12:20.800 --> 12:24.366
Well, all units
report a great big negativ

12:24.433 --> 12:26.466
on any
Freddy sightings tonight.

12:26.533 --> 12:28.900
He's laying low.
He knows we're watching.

12:30.166 --> 12:32.300
Yeah, well,
we're not the only ones.

12:34.666 --> 12:36.433
What does that mean?

12:36.500 --> 12:38.433
Word has it that a couple
of parents don't feel

12:38.500 --> 12:40.366
much like waiting
for Freddy to show up.

12:40.433 --> 12:41.633
They're gonna find him.

12:41.700 --> 12:42.766
Great, great.

12:42.833 --> 12:44.066
This is just
what we need right now.

12:44.133 --> 12:46.100
A bunch of half-cocked&nbsp;
vigilantes.

12:47.833 --> 12:50.700
Well, hell, Tim,
I'm just a little bit surprised

12:50.766 --> 12:52.700
that you're not out there
with 'em.

12:54.233 --> 12:56.033
You know, I came here
because I thought

12:56.100 --> 12:58.633
one man could make a difference.

12:58.700 --> 13:01.233
...and he can...
by upholding the law

13:01.300 --> 13:02.566
'not by breaking it.'

13:02.633 --> 13:04.633
Yeah, well, sometimes you gotta

13:04.700 --> 13:05.766
bend it just a little bit.

13:05.833 --> 13:08.566
What, like them out there?
No. No.

13:08.633 --> 13:11.400
I know the law,
I know where it begins

13:11.466 --> 13:13.866
and I know where it ends.

13:13.933 --> 13:15.966
- 'Do you?'
- Yeah, chief.

13:16.033 --> 13:17.166
Good.

13:17.233 --> 13:19.466
Then take a unit
and start patrolling.

13:19.533 --> 13:22.500
And radio in if you spot
any concerned citizens.

13:24.533 --> 13:26.466
You got it.

13:32.600 --> 13:34.533
God, I hate hick towns.

13:45.000 --> 13:47.566
- Which way did he go?
- Come on.

13:47.633 --> 13:49.600
Come on.

14:02.066 --> 14:03.533
You must be starving..

14:03.600 --> 14:07.000
Appreciate it.
Thank you. Thank you.

14:07.066 --> 14:08.366
Just shout if you need
anything else.

14:08.433 --> 14:10.400
Thank you.

14:19.366 --> 14:21.566
That guard won't do any good.

14:21.633 --> 14:23.800
'Lisa, please,
not in front of your sister.'

14:24.966 --> 14:27.033
Mom, she knows better
than all of us.

14:27.100 --> 14:29.033
'Lisa, stop.'

14:55.933 --> 14:56.933
Over here.

15:11.933 --> 15:14.900
- Good God! He lived here?
- Well, he's not here now.

15:19.700 --> 15:23.066
This was Mary's. My Mary.

15:27.733 --> 15:29.833
'He's not here.
That means he's in town.'

15:57.633 --> 15:58.966
Unit two to base.

15:59.033 --> 16:00.833
'Base here. What's up, chief?'

16:00.900 --> 16:03.266
Yeah, Tim,
I think I just spotted

16:03.333 --> 16:05.433
our citizen's committee
heading down Elm Street

16:05.500 --> 16:07.566
with a back seat
full of firepower.

16:07.633 --> 16:08.800
'Krueger must be in town.'

16:08.866 --> 16:10.800
All I need
is their interference.

16:12.066 --> 16:14.133
Alright. 10-4, Gene.

16:14.200 --> 16:15.133
Roger.

16:17.766 --> 16:19.600
Unit three, this is base.

16:19.666 --> 16:21.633
Do you read me, Lou?

16:23.366 --> 16:27.433
Lou? Lou, come in.

16:27.500 --> 16:29.433
'Do you read me, Lou?
Lou, come in.'

16:30.600 --> 16:32.066
'Unit three, this is base.'

16:32.133 --> 16:34.300
'Lou, do you read me?'

16:39.000 --> 16:41.033
This night never ends.

17:25.133 --> 17:26.300
Lou?

17:30.200 --> 17:31.633
Lou?

17:32.266 --> 17:34.233
Are you here?

17:37.166 --> 17:38.966
Lou?

17:39.033 --> 17:41.000
Are you out here?

17:50.666 --> 17:52.200
He's out there now.

17:52.266 --> 17:53.200
Just relax, Lisa.

17:53.266 --> 17:54.400
Your father's
gonna be home soon.

17:54.466 --> 17:55.933
Everything's gonna be fine.

17:56.000 --> 17:58.033
Freddy's here!
I feel him!

18:00.533 --> 18:01.533
Listen..

18:04.533 --> 18:06.933
Now, look,
you're getting her all upset.

18:07.000 --> 18:09.266
It's okay, honey. It's okay.

18:09.333 --> 18:12.166
- He's come for us.
- Please stop it!

18:12.233 --> 18:14.000
I can't take this anymore!

18:14.066 --> 18:15.433
Enough about Fred Krueger!

18:44.700 --> 18:46.900
- Alright, be careful now.
- Hurry up!

18:48.266 --> 18:50.266
- Come on, hurry up.
- John, go to the other side.

18:50.333 --> 18:52.000
- Go around the other side.
- Like a shark to blood.

18:52.066 --> 18:54.933
- There's his truck.
- 'He's after the twins.'

18:55.000 --> 18:56.933
Pick up where he left off.

18:57.900 --> 18:59.833
Check out all the hedges.

19:01.800 --> 19:03.800
Run around back. Come on.

19:12.166 --> 19:14.000
What the hell is going on here?

19:14.066 --> 19:16.033
John, come over here with me.

19:16.733 --> 19:18.266
Evening, Tim.

19:18.333 --> 19:20.700
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

19:20.766 --> 19:22.300
We're doing
what you should have done.

19:22.366 --> 19:25.166
No. You listen to me.
I'm going to nail the slime.

19:25.233 --> 19:27.166
I'm going to do it clean
and by the book.

19:27.233 --> 19:29.433
- 'His truck's gone.'
- We're way past your book.

19:29.500 --> 19:32.666
- He's gone.
- 'Let's head back, okay?'

19:32.733 --> 19:34.033
- Tim.
- You okay?

19:34.100 --> 19:37.066
- Is everything alright?
- Yeah.

19:37.133 --> 19:38.800
- What are they doing here?
- Nothing. Nothing.

19:38.866 --> 19:41.433
Just go back inside
and lock the door.

19:43.133 --> 19:45.133
Freddy was here.

19:45.200 --> 19:46.666
Honey, go back inside, okay?

19:46.733 --> 19:48.566
Go in with your sister.
I'm coming. I'm coming.

19:48.633 --> 19:50.200
It's alright.

19:50.266 --> 19:51.433
Sarah..

19:52.433 --> 19:54.133
...you know where the gun is.

19:54.200 --> 19:56.466
Stay inside till I get back.

19:56.533 --> 19:57.933
- Sarah--
- But I..

19:58.000 --> 19:59.800
Stay with the girls.

19:59.866 --> 20:01.800
Be careful.

20:08.033 --> 20:08.966
Lou?

21:08.733 --> 21:11.000
You think you was
gonna get rid of me?

21:17.766 --> 21:21.566
- Look. It's him. It's him.
- It is.

21:21.633 --> 21:23.600
'It's him. It's him. Go ahead.'

21:28.500 --> 21:29.933
- 'No.'
- Put the gun down, Deeks.

21:30.000 --> 21:31.700
Let's take him now
while we have the chance.

21:31.766 --> 21:34.000
- 'Get him.'
- 'Drop the gun.'

21:42.066 --> 21:44.933
'Drop the gun.'

21:45.000 --> 21:47.133
Whose side are you on anyway?

21:47.200 --> 21:48.566
Yours.

21:48.633 --> 21:50.966
Do you, all of you

21:51.033 --> 21:53.300
want to be on the same level
as this piece of dirt?

21:54.200 --> 21:55.900
Doc, look at you.

21:55.966 --> 21:58.333
You're a dentist,
not an executioner.

21:58.400 --> 22:01.500
I got a right
to remain at large, cop.

22:01.566 --> 22:03.566
I got a right to remain silent.

22:06.166 --> 22:08.833
Can you hear that?
Tim, are you listening?

22:08.900 --> 22:10.400
I'm taking him in
clean and legal.

22:10.466 --> 22:13.033
Anybody who wants to get
in my way can come along..

22:13.100 --> 22:14.533
...in handcuffs.

22:14.600 --> 22:17.800
Hey, cop, you got
pretty little girls.

22:19.833 --> 22:21.266
Shut up!

22:21.333 --> 22:22.766
We, uh, we got interrupted

22:22.833 --> 22:24.833
before I could
get to know 'em.

22:24.900 --> 22:27.733
They'll like me
a lot better next time.

22:27.800 --> 22:29.833
Next time?

22:29.900 --> 22:31.133
Let me kill him.

22:31.200 --> 22:35.400
I...am...forever.

22:39.066 --> 22:41.700
The law is the law.

22:44.300 --> 22:47.833
But tonight,
the law is on vacation.

22:54.600 --> 22:55.766
That's it.

22:55.833 --> 22:58.000
Pour it all over me.

22:58.066 --> 22:59.266
'I'm thirty.'

22:59.333 --> 23:00.800
'Oh, you missed a spot.'

23:00.866 --> 23:02.166
Ha ha ha.

23:02.233 --> 23:03.866
Gonna have a cookout, huh?

23:03.933 --> 23:05.866
Go ahead! Go ahead!

23:05.933 --> 23:08.033
Light it. I dare ya, cop!

23:08.100 --> 23:11.033
'Go ahead, you pig! Come on!'

23:11.100 --> 23:13.966
I'd rather burn up
than fade away!

23:16.433 --> 23:18.033
I'll be back!

23:18.100 --> 23:21.100
I'm free! Free!

23:39.866 --> 23:42.033
We're all in this together.

23:42.100 --> 23:44.400
The rest of the town
hears nothing, understood?

23:44.466 --> 23:46.833
You did the only thing
a man could do.

23:46.900 --> 23:48.966
Daddy, you can't kill Freddy.

23:49.033 --> 23:51.000
You'll only make it worse.

24:05.500 --> 24:07.433
That was then.

24:09.100 --> 24:11.300
This is now.

24:19.100 --> 24:23.766
Springwood's nightmares
are just beginning.

26:08.600 --> 26:11.633
Uh....what?

26:11.700 --> 26:13.233
It's another bad dream.

26:13.300 --> 26:15.900
I can't shake 'em.

26:15.966 --> 26:17.300
Ever since..

26:17.366 --> 26:19.466
...that night, I..

26:19.533 --> 26:22.666
Listen to me, listen.

26:22.733 --> 26:24.700
You didn't kill a person.

26:25.833 --> 26:30.100
You killed...
some mindless, evil thing.

26:30.166 --> 26:33.300
The law doesn't care about
the difference between the two.

26:33.366 --> 26:35.133
Well, I do.

26:35.200 --> 26:37.366
We all do.

26:37.433 --> 26:39.400
Look, you're a cop.

26:40.233 --> 26:42.733
You killed Fred Krueger.

26:42.800 --> 26:44.933
You were protecting
our daughters.

26:49.500 --> 26:51.600
Look, the real nightmare's over.

26:52.833 --> 26:55.400
We can handle
a few bad dreams.

27:34.933 --> 27:37.033
Okay, now, you watch
your sister, alright?

27:37.100 --> 27:38.366
Hmm.

27:38.433 --> 27:40.100
Merit?

27:40.166 --> 27:42.066
Baby?

27:42.133 --> 27:44.100
Don't worry about anything

27:45.466 --> 27:47.233
Look, if she has any problems

27:47.300 --> 27:49.833
call me, I'll come pick her up.

27:49.900 --> 27:52.300
And don't worry
about the other kids, okay?

27:52.366 --> 27:54.300
They all understand.

27:55.733 --> 27:57.300
Is she mad at me about anything?

27:57.366 --> 27:58.666
No, daddy.

27:58.733 --> 28:00.000
You know how she is.

28:00.066 --> 28:02.166
She sees the school counselor
twice a week

28:02.233 --> 28:04.500
and he says
she's getting better.

28:04.566 --> 28:06.533
Forgetting about Freddy.

28:16.000 --> 28:18.466
Come on, Merit.

28:33.166 --> 28:34.833
'Alright, see this
second hand..'

28:50.366 --> 28:52.566
"I'm burning in hell.

28:52.633 --> 28:54.600
Wish you was here."

28:58.400 --> 28:59.333
'Hey.'

29:00.300 --> 29:01.733
We're gonna have guests.

29:03.333 --> 29:05.133
- What?
- FBI.

29:05.200 --> 29:06.900
They think they can
tie our boy Freddy

29:06.966 --> 29:09.033
into serial killings
all over the state.

29:09.100 --> 29:10.700
They're coming down here?

29:12.033 --> 29:14.300
Our troubles are over, Tim!

29:14.366 --> 29:15.966
They feel bad
about Freddy getting off

29:16.033 --> 29:17.300
with the mistrial and all.

29:17.366 --> 29:19.033
They're gonna help us find him.

29:19.100 --> 29:20.433
It's just a matter of time now.

29:20.500 --> 29:22.366
They're not going to find him.

29:22.433 --> 29:24.433
Oh, hell, Tim,
these guys are pros.

29:24.500 --> 29:26.933
They're not going to find him.

29:28.200 --> 29:29.600
'Not alive, that is.'

29:29.666 --> 29:31.066
What are you talking about?

29:31.133 --> 29:33.066
A bunch of us..

29:33.133 --> 29:36.800
...Deeks, the doc,
some of the other parents

29:36.866 --> 29:39.000
'we tracked him back
to his boiler room'

29:39.066 --> 29:41.433
'cornered him,
we burned him alive.'

29:43.100 --> 29:45.033
I threw the match.

29:46.900 --> 29:49.800
Hell, Tim, nobody's
gonna blame you in this town.

29:49.866 --> 29:52.433
'Maybe not. But the feds
won't be so forgiving.'

29:53.500 --> 29:55.200
I killed a man

29:55.266 --> 29:57.433
in cold blood, Gene.

29:57.500 --> 30:00.133
What are you so worried
about the feds for?

30:00.200 --> 30:01.800
S-so they find a body, so what?

30:01.866 --> 30:04.300
- No one's gonna talk.
- Springwood's too small.

30:04.366 --> 30:06.700
Somebody will crack.
Somebody always cracks.

30:06.766 --> 30:09.533
When they do, I'm history.

30:09.600 --> 30:11.533
Not if there isn't
anybody to find.

30:13.500 --> 30:15.266
I'll go to the power plant.

30:15.333 --> 30:17.900
I'll take care of the body.

30:17.966 --> 30:19.400
Hide it good.

30:19.466 --> 30:21.433
You leave that to me, Tim.

30:24.066 --> 30:26.033
You're not a criminal.

30:28.500 --> 30:30.433
You're a hero.

30:31.300 --> 30:33.233
You're covered as of now.

30:44.000 --> 30:46.300
Look, the real

30:44.000 --> 30:46.300
nightmare's over.

30:46.366 --> 30:48.933
We can handle a few bad dreams.

30:51.766 --> 30:53.600
Here, chicky, chicky, chicky..

31:08.766 --> 31:10.200
Dammit!

31:10.266 --> 31:12.233
'Stratton to Blocker, over.'

31:14.766 --> 31:16.433
Yeah.

31:16.500 --> 31:17.633
I'm here, Gene, go ahead.

31:17.700 --> 31:19.700
'Tim, uh..'

31:19.766 --> 31:21.500
'...couple of our boys
just discovered'

31:21.566 --> 31:23.433
'a body over
at the power plant.'

31:23.500 --> 31:25.133
I thought you were
going to take care of that!

31:25.200 --> 31:27.500
'I did, Tim. I swear.'

31:27.566 --> 31:29.433
Well, then..

31:29.500 --> 31:31.433
...whose body did they find?

31:43.033 --> 31:44.700
I came up here
right after I left you.

31:44.766 --> 31:46.733
I found the body
right where you said.

31:46.800 --> 31:48.266
I hid it over here.

31:48.333 --> 31:50.400
Look.

31:50.466 --> 31:52.433
I even welded
the damn thing shut.

31:54.933 --> 31:56.100
Let's open it up.

31:56.166 --> 31:58.100
- Oh, Tim.
- I wanna open it up!

32:00.000 --> 32:02.033
Okay, alright.

32:05.000 --> 32:05.933
Here.

32:49.333 --> 32:51.300
They want me to check
the body out right now.

32:51.366 --> 32:53.066
It can't be Krueger.

32:53.133 --> 32:54.400
It just can't be.

32:54.466 --> 32:56.200
Gene came down here before

32:56.266 --> 32:57.733
took the body and hid it.

32:57.800 --> 32:59.166
Now it's missing.

32:59.233 --> 33:01.033
Look, Krueger couldn't
just walk back here.

33:01.100 --> 33:03.233
Wait, we've got
worse problems.

33:03.300 --> 33:05.533
We need to have a meeting
with everybody who was here.

33:05.600 --> 33:07.466
You, me, Deeks,
all the others.

33:07.533 --> 33:09.600
The FBI is coming to town.

33:09.666 --> 33:11.266
- What?
- Yeah, that's right.

33:11.333 --> 33:13.800
So we'd better have our story
straight before they get here.

33:13.866 --> 33:15.333
Especially if Krueger
shows up dead

33:15.400 --> 33:17.666
before they get a chance
to look.

33:17.733 --> 33:19.966
We'll have a meeting
in my office tomorrow.

33:20.033 --> 33:21.933
- Can you tell the others?
- Yeah, yeah, sure.

33:22.000 --> 33:24.000
- They're bringing out the body.
- 'Coming through here.'

33:28.733 --> 33:30.700
- Alright, thanks.
- Uh-huh.

33:34.233 --> 33:35.600
Oh, my God.

33:35.666 --> 33:36.933
Deeks.

33:38.466 --> 33:42.133
What the hell
was he doing here, man?

33:42.200 --> 33:44.900
He must have cracked.
Came back here.

33:44.966 --> 33:47.300
I hate to admit it,
but I'm kinda relieved.

33:48.133 --> 33:49.800
I'm not.

33:49.866 --> 33:51.800
We're still missing one body.

33:53.100 --> 33:55.033
Give me this.

33:56.300 --> 33:57.633
Mm! Ow!

33:57.700 --> 33:59.300
What's the matter?

33:59.366 --> 34:01.333
Tooth problem?

34:01.400 --> 34:03.433
Come on by the office tomorrow,
I'll take care of it for you.

34:03.500 --> 34:05.166
Tim.

34:05.233 --> 34:06.700
Look.

34:32.933 --> 34:34.066
Honey, are you alright?

34:34.133 --> 34:36.533
It's, it's all
coming apart, Sarah.

34:37.800 --> 34:41.900
The town...the people...me.

34:41.966 --> 34:43.033
'Oh, Tim.'

34:43.800 --> 34:45.733
You're not a murderer.

34:49.400 --> 34:52.933
What was Deeks doing
at the murder site?

34:53.000 --> 34:54.500
Are you blaming yourself
for Deeks?

34:54.566 --> 34:56.233
Is that what
this is all about?

34:56.300 --> 34:59.500
Maybe...he went up
to check on the body.

34:59.566 --> 35:01.433
To get rid of it.

35:01.500 --> 35:03.366
But...I-I'd already
taken care of that.

35:03.433 --> 35:05.866
I had Gene hide it.

35:05.933 --> 35:09.166
When...when Deeks
found it missing, maybe he..

35:09.233 --> 35:11.900
...he-he freaked,
he...had a heart attack.

35:11.966 --> 35:13.733
Honey..

35:13.800 --> 35:15.266
...you can't
really believe that.

35:15.333 --> 35:17.300
It's the only sane explanation.

35:18.200 --> 35:20.766
Right now Ineedsane

35:20.833 --> 35:22.466
Ow! God..

35:22.533 --> 35:25.433
Tim, come on, relax.

35:25.500 --> 35:28.666
Relax, honey,
it's gonna be okay, come on.

35:28.733 --> 35:30.700
Tell that to the FBI.

35:31.866 --> 35:33.833
I'd rather tell it to you.

35:38.600 --> 35:40.533
Just relax.

35:40.600 --> 35:42.533
Come on. It's alright.

35:44.100 --> 35:46.166
Don't worry.

35:46.233 --> 35:47.766
'It's alright.'

35:47.833 --> 35:50.333
'You're an honest cop.'

35:50.400 --> 35:52.333
'No one's gonna arrest a cop.'

35:55.433 --> 35:56.533
Hey!

35:57.400 --> 35:59.600
I, I did this town a favor!

36:01.133 --> 36:03.666
Everybody said so!

36:03.733 --> 36:05.900
I was protecting
my little girls!

36:06.666 --> 36:08.133
Listen to me!

36:10.233 --> 36:12.800
'This isn't fair!'

36:12.866 --> 36:15.200
'This isn't fa-a-air!'

36:16.466 --> 36:19.566
This isn't fair!

36:19.633 --> 36:22.533
Open wide.

36:28.700 --> 36:32.600
No-o-o!

36:38.933 --> 36:41.333
I know...what's real.

36:48.533 --> 36:50.466
Leave me alone!

36:50.533 --> 36:52.500
Not another dream!

37:15.600 --> 37:17.533
Daddy? Are you alright?

37:20.200 --> 37:21.933
'Merit?'

37:22.000 --> 37:23.900
'Baby?'

37:23.966 --> 37:26.533
Daddy's just been having
a little trouble these days.

37:27.233 --> 37:28.200
Alright?

37:34.200 --> 37:36.133
She talks about it, daddy.

37:37.933 --> 37:39.766
She talks?

37:39.833 --> 37:41.300
In her sleep.

37:41.366 --> 37:42.833
When she can sleep.

37:42.900 --> 37:44.600
What does she say?

37:44.666 --> 37:47.633
Mostly she says his name
over and over.

37:57.400 --> 37:58.933
Daddy!

37:59.000 --> 38:00.266
Who told you?

38:00.333 --> 38:01.566
Who have you been
talking to in this town?

38:01.633 --> 38:02.966
No one, daddy, really!

38:03.033 --> 38:04.333
Answer me!

38:15.333 --> 38:17.300
I'll get it!

38:20.733 --> 38:22.366
'Girls, your ride's here!'

38:22.433 --> 38:24.400
Come on, Merit.

38:26.166 --> 38:28.100
Let's go.

38:29.600 --> 38:31.200
Come on.

38:31.266 --> 38:33.133
Merit.

38:33.200 --> 38:35.133
Come on!

38:48.233 --> 38:49.533
Tim.

38:50.333 --> 38:51.766
We have to leave.

38:51.833 --> 38:53.366
What, to go where?

38:53.433 --> 38:54.566
Leave town.

38:54.633 --> 38:56.300
Leave Springwood. We have to.

38:56.366 --> 38:58.133
Tim, we have
a life here, you know.

38:58.200 --> 38:59.433
We need to get out.

38:59.500 --> 39:01.566
Before he gets both the girls.

39:01.633 --> 39:03.866
Look, you're scaring me.

39:03.933 --> 39:07.900
You know, even New York is safe
compared to Springwood.

39:07.966 --> 39:10.433
At least there
you see them coming.

39:10.500 --> 39:12.666
We'll go back,
we'll, we'll lock ourselves in

39:12.733 --> 39:13.900
we'll be safe again.

39:13.966 --> 39:15.300
Would you stop it?

39:15.366 --> 39:16.700
I called a meeting

39:16.766 --> 39:18.466
to tell the others
to do the same.

39:18.533 --> 39:20.566
When I get back..

39:20.633 --> 39:22.600
...be ready to leave.

39:22.700 --> 39:23.633
Tim.

39:24.300 --> 39:25.533
Tim!

39:28.833 --> 39:30.933
Freddy's poisoned this place.

39:32.100 --> 39:34.033
He owns it.

39:43.200 --> 39:45.133
What's the matter with him?

39:46.200 --> 39:48.900
God. What's the matter with him?

39:54.866 --> 39:57.233
So, Lieutenant Blocker,
you finally made it here.

39:58.600 --> 40:00.566
Doc told me
about that chipped tooth.

40:00.633 --> 40:02.900
Oh, uh,
that's not why I'm here.

40:02.966 --> 40:04.700
Could you get the doc for me?

40:04.766 --> 40:05.733
Sure.

40:05.800 --> 40:07.733
Have a seat.

40:12.766 --> 40:14.933
- You ready to go?
- Yeah.

40:15.000 --> 40:16.466
Here, Blocker, just let me
have another look at the tooth.

40:16.533 --> 40:17.700
No, no, we don't have time

40:17.766 --> 40:19.066
It's just a temporary seal.

40:19.133 --> 40:20.200
Five minutes
and we're out of here.

40:20.266 --> 40:22.166
Alright, just...
make it quick.

40:22.233 --> 40:23.666
You got it.

40:23.733 --> 40:25.233
Just go on down there,
last door on the right.

40:25.300 --> 40:27.233
Mary Ann will be in in just
a minute to get you ready.

40:45.500 --> 40:48.300
Sarah told me where to find you.

40:48.366 --> 40:50.666
She called the office all upset.

40:50.733 --> 40:52.600
What are you talking about?

40:52.666 --> 40:53.966
Leaving town?

40:54.033 --> 40:55.333
'Quitting?'

40:56.300 --> 40:58.600
It's no use anymore, Gene.

40:58.666 --> 41:00.766
As soon as the feds show up,
I'm dead.

41:00.833 --> 41:02.533
Feds?

41:02.600 --> 41:04.600
Who said anything
about the feds?

41:06.866 --> 41:09.400
Who said anything
about the feds?

41:09.466 --> 41:11.366
What, are you playing with me?

41:11.433 --> 41:12.933
You did! You..

41:13.000 --> 41:14.466
You told me yesterday, the FBI's

41:14.533 --> 41:15.866
coming in to nail Krueger!

41:15.933 --> 41:19.233
Take it easy, Tim. I-I hid
the body just like you said.

41:19.300 --> 41:20.866
Everything's fine.

41:20.933 --> 41:22.900
Krueger's body is gone!

41:24.066 --> 41:26.166
Well, you saw!
We, we opened the trunk!

41:26.233 --> 41:27.833
Yes, I saw.

41:27.900 --> 41:29.700
I saw the trunk welded shut.

41:29.766 --> 41:31.333
That body is going nowhere.

41:33.066 --> 41:34.333
I'm losing it, Gene.

41:34.400 --> 41:36.833
I'm losing it!

41:36.900 --> 41:38.666
'Take it easy, Tim.'

41:38.733 --> 41:40.833
You're just stressed out.

41:40.900 --> 41:42.233
Everything is fine.

41:42.300 --> 41:44.800
They'll forget about it
in two weeks.

41:44.866 --> 41:47.766
This is all
behind you, Tim. Relax.

41:49.700 --> 41:51.900
Okay, buddy?

41:51.966 --> 41:54.133
I see you're in good hands.

41:54.200 --> 41:56.133
I'll check you later.

42:00.800 --> 42:02.833
Doc will be in
in just a second.

42:08.866 --> 42:10.933
This'll relax you.

42:35.800 --> 42:38.300
You know..

42:38.366 --> 42:41.300
...this gas lets me
see through your clothes.

42:43.633 --> 42:46.366
It's just the nitrous
taking effect.

42:46.433 --> 42:49.400
Boy, it really it painless

42:51.200 --> 42:53.366
And now
for the sodium pentothal.

42:53.433 --> 42:55.533
Mmm. I'm getting the works, huh?

42:55.600 --> 42:56.733
Oh, you deserve it, lieutenant.

43:00.500 --> 43:01.566
Mmm.

43:06.666 --> 43:09.100
Now I want you
to count backwards from ten.

43:10.933 --> 43:12.866
Ten..

43:12.933 --> 43:15.000
...nine..

43:15.066 --> 43:16.533
...eight..

43:16.600 --> 43:18.766
...seven..

43:18.833 --> 43:21.266
...six..

43:21.333 --> 43:23.100
...five..

43:23.166 --> 43:27.533
'One, two,
Freddy's comin' for you.'

43:27.600 --> 43:31.800
'Three, four,
better lock your door.'

43:36.000 --> 43:37.766
All those teeth

43:37.833 --> 43:39.366
mm-mm, mm-mm, mm-mm, no,

43:39.433 --> 43:41.633
I'm afraid
they'll all have to go!

43:41.700 --> 43:44.133
You tell Freddy
when it doesn't hurt!

43:45.366 --> 43:47.566
But...you're dead!

43:47.633 --> 43:51.033
Big deal!

43:51.100 --> 43:53.933
'Ah, ah, no-o-o!'

44:13.266 --> 44:14.600
Now there's a smile

44:14.666 --> 44:17.333
every mother can love.

44:21.866 --> 44:24.133
Oh, God, please, please.

44:24.200 --> 44:25.466
- What happened?
- I..

44:25.533 --> 44:26.533
He must have had
some reaction to the gas--

44:26.600 --> 44:28.533
Mary Ann, Mary Ann.

44:36.033 --> 44:39.100
'Oh, God, oh, God.'

44:46.233 --> 44:48.533
Sweet dreams.

44:50.400 --> 44:51.933
Who's next?

44:53.566 --> 44:54.933
You?

44:57.033 --> 44:58.166
Or maybe..

44:58.233 --> 44:59.766
...you.

45:05.633 --> 45:07.700
Or how about..

45:07.766 --> 45:09.400
...one of you?
