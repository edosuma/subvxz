10:23.334 --> 10:24.934
* Hey!
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da *

10:24.934 --> 10:27.534
Hey, amigos, hello.
Can we, like, stop singing

10:27.534 --> 10:29.000
and go get
something to eat here?

10:29.000 --> 10:31.601
Are you crazy? Look
at the progress we're making.

10:31.601 --> 10:33.234
I'm gonna be sick.

10:33.234 --> 10:35.000
Willie, the same thing happened

10:35.000 --> 10:36.801
when my family went to see
my cousin Mindy

10:36.801 --> 10:39.234
in a production of <i>The Best</i>
 <i>Little Whorehouse in Texas.</i>

10:39.234 --> 10:41.934
We were too late to grab dinner
and I ended up barfing

10:41.934 --> 10:43.567
four times on the way
to Sacramento.

10:43.567 --> 10:46.501
Okay, whatever, but we're
only stopping for 10 minutes.

10:46.501 --> 10:47.968
Right. We want to get there
in time

10:47.968 --> 10:49.601
to stake out
a place for the night.

10:49.601 --> 10:51.701
Speaking of which, look,
I just found a great one

10:51.701 --> 10:54.367
right here in the guidebook.
Guidebook?

10:54.367 --> 10:56.467
There's an outdoor pool
and a buffeteria.

10:56.467 --> 10:58.400
Will, you want to help
me out here?

10:58.400 --> 10:59.868
Forget it. Forget it.

10:59.868 --> 11:01.267
There's an in-room coffeemaker.

11:01.267 --> 11:03.968
Now, that's nice. I mean,
that saves time and money.

11:03.968 --> 11:05.300
Will.
Right.

11:05.300 --> 11:07.367
Out of the question.
We're sleeping on the beach

11:07.367 --> 11:08.634
under the stars.
Right.

11:08.634 --> 11:10.300
I don't think so.

11:10.300 --> 11:12.167
That was the whole
point of the trip, Sarah.

11:12.167 --> 11:14.367
What? To sleep outside
where we could get robbed

11:14.367 --> 11:16.767
or murdered or bug bites?
Yes.

11:16.767 --> 11:18.267
I mean, yeah, sort of.

11:18.267 --> 11:21.834
The point is to take
some chances so that someday,

11:21.834 --> 11:23.968
when we have to stay in motels,
we can say that--

11:23.968 --> 11:27.234
That for a few days at least we
were a little bit adventurous.

11:27.234 --> 11:28.701
A-and we kind
of lived by our wits.

11:28.701 --> 11:31.000
And damn it, we handled
whatever came our way.

11:31.000 --> 11:32.267
Anything.

11:32.267 --> 11:34.300
Your engine light just went on.

11:36.434 --> 11:37.801
We're screwed.

11:37.801 --> 11:39.734
[***]

11:43.901 --> 11:45.634
Hey.

11:45.634 --> 11:47.901
Oh, hey.

11:47.901 --> 11:50.868
God, two days in a row, huh?

11:50.868 --> 11:51.868
You looking for me?

11:52.734 --> 11:55.367
No. Uh, no.

11:55.367 --> 11:56.934
I actually have an internship

11:56.934 --> 11:59.033
at a publishing house nearby.

11:59.033 --> 12:00.968
You don't have to explain.

12:00.968 --> 12:03.767
No. I-I know. I just--

12:03.767 --> 12:06.334
S-so, are you having a good time
with all your friends?

12:06.334 --> 12:07.701
Yeah.

12:07.701 --> 12:08.834
Been hanging out a lot.

12:08.834 --> 12:10.667
Stayin' pretty busy.

12:10.667 --> 12:12.601
I mean, that's--
That's why I didn't call--

12:12.601 --> 12:15.334
Oh.
Yeah, yeah, I figured.

12:18.300 --> 12:19.667
A-anyway, uh,

12:19.667 --> 12:22.868
you all doing something great
again tonight?

12:28.334 --> 12:29.400
Do you wanna get together?

12:31.033 --> 12:33.234
You and me?

12:33.234 --> 12:34.634
Uh-huh.

12:34.634 --> 12:37.000
Um, definitely,

12:37.000 --> 12:38.133
If-- If you want to.

12:39.801 --> 12:41.934
Yeah.
Yeah, I want to.

12:45.834 --> 12:48.234
Did she say anything
to you this morning?

12:48.234 --> 12:50.801
Yeah. She, uh--

12:50.801 --> 12:52.601
She told me the mattress sags.

12:55.567 --> 12:56.934
I want her out of here,
Kirsten.

12:57.968 --> 12:59.133
ASAP.

12:59.133 --> 13:00.701
You're not serious.

13:00.701 --> 13:02.334
I can't believe
that you're serious.

13:02.334 --> 13:04.601
Well, believe. That woman
has made it very clear

13:04.601 --> 13:06.801
just how much
she hates my guts.

13:06.801 --> 13:09.300
I'm not inclined to be a tower
of support for her,

13:09.300 --> 13:11.067
whatever it is
she's going through.

13:11.067 --> 13:12.767
Well,
what am I supposed to do, huh?

13:12.767 --> 13:15.000
Say, "Gee, Mom,
sorry your marriage is kaput.

13:15.000 --> 13:15.934
Can I call you a cab?"

13:17.400 --> 13:19.834
Uh, for God's sake,
Charlie, she's a mess.

13:19.834 --> 13:21.567
She's a mess,
and she's my mother.

13:21.567 --> 13:22.634
She needs me.

13:32.167 --> 13:34.334
I did some planting,
did you see?

13:34.334 --> 13:37.434
Hydrangeas don't do well
in direct sun.

13:39.701 --> 13:41.934
Mom, if you don't talk to me,
I'm gonna call Dad.

13:41.934 --> 13:43.133
That's all there is to it.

13:43.133 --> 13:45.434
I had an affair
with Howard Laughton.

13:47.601 --> 13:48.601
What?

13:48.601 --> 13:49.767
Howard Laughton.

13:51.000 --> 13:52.467
Well, you remember him.

13:52.467 --> 13:55.267
He and your daddy
played golf together.

13:55.267 --> 13:57.901
He owns the dealership where
we bought the blue Lincoln.

13:57.901 --> 14:00.734
You--?
You had an affair?

14:00.734 --> 14:03.567
It was, uh, right when
you went away to college.

14:03.567 --> 14:05.601
I was going through
that empty nest thing.

14:05.601 --> 14:08.300
Your daddy was away
on one of his selling seminars.

14:08.300 --> 14:10.801
And Howard and I happened to
run into each other at the club.

14:10.801 --> 14:13.634
I don't want to hear this.
He asked me out to dinner--

14:13.634 --> 14:15.868
I really don't want
to hear this, okay?

14:18.200 --> 14:20.434
No, of course not.
I'm sorry.

14:20.434 --> 14:22.968
It was a mistake, Kirsten.

14:26.033 --> 14:29.167
How did--?
How did Dad--?

14:29.167 --> 14:31.634
Last week he was
fixing my dresser.

14:31.634 --> 14:33.901
The bottom drawer
always sticks.

14:38.400 --> 14:40.033
He found a letter.

14:42.534 --> 14:44.734
From Howard to me.

14:45.734 --> 14:46.834
God.

14:49.934 --> 14:51.334
It was five weeks.

14:54.067 --> 14:55.834
Five weeks, eight years ago.

14:57.267 --> 15:00.834
You hold that
up against 29 years?

15:00.834 --> 15:04.000
Twenty-nine years your father
and I have been together.

15:09.934 --> 15:12.834
Twenty-nine years
and he just

15:12.834 --> 15:17.200
came down the stairs
with my suitcase,

15:17.200 --> 15:21.567
and he put it at the doorstep,
and he asked me for my

15:21.567 --> 15:23.467
house keys back.

15:25.934 --> 15:26.934
Good for him.

15:37.701 --> 15:39.968
No. I'm meeting him.
You expecting someone? Coming.

15:39.968 --> 15:41.934
If this is your father,
I'm gonna kill myself.

15:41.934 --> 15:43.901
Yeah, listen, Charlie,
I gotta talk to you.

15:45.067 --> 15:46.734
Can I help you?

15:46.734 --> 15:48.534
I'm Byron.
I'm here to see Claudia.

15:50.801 --> 15:52.100
You're Byron?

15:52.100 --> 15:54.200
Well, she told you
I was coming, right?

15:54.200 --> 15:56.667
Uh, yeah, yeah.
I guess we just, um--

15:56.667 --> 15:58.701
We just all assumed that--

15:58.701 --> 16:00.968
What? That--
That I was making it all up?

16:08.934 --> 16:11.200
What's going on?
Never mind.

Hey, hey, hey.
Don't look at me.

check the engine before we left.

16:31.901 --> 16:33.801
You know what?
Go ahead. Beat each other up.

16:33.801 --> 16:35.200

for, Will?

My fault?

Hey, you're-- You're
the one who invited

16:42.534 --> 16:45.267
the two killjoy sisters along.
And look at this,

16:45.267 --> 16:47.467
they got us snapping
at each other now.

16:47.467 --> 16:49.501
And-- And I am telling you,

16:49.501 --> 16:52.167
it is a whole
glass-is-half-empty mentality.

16:52.167 --> 16:55.200
You're right. No, you're right.
It's very destructive.

16:55.200 --> 16:56.834
Yes, it is.

I mean-- I mean, so what if--

16:58.734 --> 17:01.767
If we hit a few snags,
a few detours along the way?

This is very nice scenery.

Well, I can tow you into town,
but I can't get that darn thing

the right way, he, uh--

18:03.767 --> 18:07.133
How do you know
Mr. Conklin has a comb over?

18:09.367 --> 18:10.400
You said.

18:10.400 --> 18:11.501
No.

18:11.501 --> 18:12.634
No, I didn't.

a lot of old guys have that lame
hair stuff going on,

18:19.934 --> 18:21.968
right?

18:21.968 --> 18:23.534
I-I wrote you this letter

18:23.534 --> 18:25.901
describing the people
that I work with.

18:30.067 --> 18:32.400
You-- You got my letters,
didn't you?

18:32.400 --> 18:34.734
S-so you knew that
Justin and I broke up?

18:37.067 --> 18:41.300
Y-You've known since--
God, l-last spring.

18:43.267 --> 18:45.167
All those letters,
what did you do with them?

18:45.167 --> 18:47.400
Did you just read them
and throw them away?

18:47.400 --> 18:49.667
No.
I wouldn't do that.

18:49.667 --> 18:52.434
You don't really want
to see me, do you?

18:52.434 --> 18:54.567
No, I-I do.

18:54.567 --> 18:56.834
It's just--

18:56.834 --> 18:58.100
It's just that you didn't know

18:58.100 --> 18:59.434
how to let me down easy.

Well, don't sweat it, Griffin.

to think about it.

she didn't cheat on you.

19:32.100 --> 19:34.067
Yes, she did.
Sure, she did.

I wanted what my parents had.

42:23.634 --> 42:25.367
What?

42:25.367 --> 42:28.133
I mean, who throws a party and
runs out of beer before 10:00?

42:28.133 --> 42:30.300
[SCOFFS]

42:30.300 --> 42:31.801
What are you doing, Griffin?

42:31.801 --> 42:33.968
Are you dropping by to kvetch
or are you--?

42:33.968 --> 42:35.534
I was planning on staying,

42:35.534 --> 42:37.667
But after this whole
beer thing, who knows.

42:38.667 --> 42:40.033
[SCOFFS]

42:40.033 --> 42:40.968
Great.

42:43.400 --> 42:44.767
You know,

42:44.767 --> 42:48.334
it's not like this isn't scary
for me.

42:48.334 --> 42:52.634
It's not like I'm not taking
a big chance with you too.

42:52.634 --> 42:54.934
I mean, you flake out,

42:54.934 --> 42:57.200
and then you drop back in
and then you flake out again,

42:57.200 --> 42:59.267
and I really wish you--
I'm staying in.

42:59.267 --> 43:02.267
I'm staying.
Okay, Julia?

43:05.200 --> 43:07.701
I mean, I just can't--
I can't not.

43:09.868 --> 43:13.300
So whatever happens,

43:13.300 --> 43:14.434
I'll risk it.

43:19.534 --> 43:20.901
Okay.

43:29.534 --> 43:32.501
I wonder if one of those little
dots out there is my ship.

43:36.167 --> 43:38.400
Ah, who cares.

43:43.734 --> 43:46.534
 <i>* Have I said too much? *</i>

43:46.534 --> 43:49.601
 <i>* Have I blown my cover? *</i>

43:49.601 --> 43:53.400
 <i>* My Indian summer *</i>

43:53.400 --> 43:56.167
 <i>* I can feel it in the air *</i>

43:58.200 --> 44:00.133
