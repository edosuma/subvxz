empty sentiment and all

01:50.264 --> 01:52.993

03:52.019 --> 03:54.250
Get it?
Because we're ghosts!

03:54.315 --> 03:56.373
Oh, dear.
A party crasher.

03:56.441 --> 03:59.250
I suppose it's a slight break
in tradition, but...

03:59.315 --> 04:00.959
The more, the merrier!

04:01.082 --> 04:03.699
I am more confused
than usual.

04:04.340 --> 04:05.457
Dewey,

04:05.559 --> 04:08.412
meet the Ghosts
of Christmas Past,

04:08.496 --> 04:10.927
Present, and Future.

04:11.215 --> 04:14.657
Years ago, they accidentally
haunted my home.

04:14.921 --> 04:16.290
Accidentally?

04:16.366 --> 04:18.726
Yeah, we were looking
for a different Scrooge.

04:18.819 --> 04:21.668
But your uncle
was way more fun!

04:21.733 --> 04:23.028
But you hate
Christmas.

04:23.093 --> 04:25.462
That's...
a bit of an act.

04:25.577 --> 04:28.290
I have so many responsibilities
throughout the year...

04:28.355 --> 04:30.034
My family, my business,

04:30.099 --> 04:33.415
secretly keeping the world-eating
serpent Jormungandr at bay...

04:33.491 --> 04:36.676
- The what?
- I just need one night a year

04:36.741 --> 04:38.673
where I can really
cut loose.

04:38.804 --> 04:42.511
So every Christmas Eve,
we use my trusty Timebrella

04:42.593 --> 04:45.240
to go back and revisit
the best Christmas parties

04:45.305 --> 04:46.993
history has to offer!

04:47.085 --> 04:49.559
- So you don't actually hate ornaments?
- Not really.

04:49.624 --> 04:50.970
- And candy canes?
- Nope.

04:51.046 --> 04:53.095
- And Santa Claus?
- No!

04:53.296 --> 04:57.509
That churlish chimney chaser
is not to be trusted!

04:59.702 --> 05:01.270
I love
having you all here,

05:01.335 --> 05:03.415
but I need a break now and
then, you understand?

05:03.499 --> 05:05.374
<i>Donald singing carol
in Spanish...</i>

05:07.849 --> 05:09.585
Yes, 100%.

05:09.702 --> 05:12.079
I'll keep it quiet.
This time.

05:12.249 --> 05:14.391
So, where's the party?

05:14.459 --> 05:16.679
Ah, ah!
<i>When's</i> the party?

05:16.765 --> 05:18.360
Ugh,
time travelers.

05:18.460 --> 05:20.306
Take heed, rise,

05:20.382 --> 05:22.571
and walk with me!

05:44.409 --> 05:46.105
So, where to first?

05:46.213 --> 05:48.758
A holiday happening
at Andy Warthog's Factory?

05:48.823 --> 05:51.501
Reveling with the rebels
crossing the Delaware?

05:57.736 --> 05:59.536
Right back
where we started?

05:59.682 --> 06:01.868
But not right back
<i>when</i> we started.

06:01.933 --> 06:04.700
- For you see...
- We get it! It's the past!

06:08.823 --> 06:10.081
Huh?

06:10.372 --> 06:12.357
- Young me.
- Old me.

06:14.270 --> 06:16.165
Bless me yesterdays,
it's...

06:16.230 --> 06:20.180
The first annual McDuck
Enterprises Christmas Party!

06:20.245 --> 06:22.331
We always visit
other peoples' festivities,

06:22.396 --> 06:25.501
so I thought we might crash
your own past nativities.

06:25.566 --> 06:27.196
Oh, this was
a right corker.

06:27.261 --> 06:30.083
I'd just started my company,
and the future was bright.

06:30.186 --> 06:33.575
Really? I always thought
Future was kinda grim!

06:33.808 --> 06:37.821
Everyone was at their most
carefree and joyous, even...

06:37.886 --> 06:42.161
Twenty-two! Twenty-two!
Twenty-two! Twenty-two!

06:42.226 --> 06:44.575
Ooh! Huh! Huh!

06:45.405 --> 06:46.616
Yes!

06:48.050 --> 06:50.371
Oh, I gots to party
with that lady.

06:50.436 --> 06:53.998
Step aside, 22.
Let a Scotsman show ya...

06:54.159 --> 06:56.711
You're a captain of industry
with your own company now.

06:56.776 --> 06:59.915
The point of this soiree is to
network, strengthen business ties,

06:59.995 --> 07:01.497
not fritter away
the night on

07:01.575 --> 07:03.058
- feckless frivolity.
-  But...

07:03.990 --> 07:06.885
So, enjoying
the party?

07:06.950 --> 07:09.451
No.

07:10.051 --> 07:12.081
That's why I live
in the now, you know?

07:12.146 --> 07:14.892
What we have is
this moment now, and...

07:14.957 --> 07:16.373
Not interested.

07:16.848 --> 07:18.561
I like your cloak.

07:18.786 --> 07:20.178
Conga line!

07:20.442 --> 07:23.049
I'm saying, given
the current economic downturn,

07:23.114 --> 07:25.744
having a Christmas that
is both holly and jolly

07:25.809 --> 07:27.686
isn't fiscally
responsible.

07:27.934 --> 07:29.721
I thought we were
taking a break.

07:29.786 --> 07:32.295
What good's a party
if I have to work at it?

07:32.372 --> 07:34.662
This party's as dead
as he is.

07:38.325 --> 07:40.756
- Maybe we should go.
- Fellas, no!

07:40.856 --> 07:44.354
Christmases were so much
better back then... uh, now.

07:44.419 --> 07:47.164
Look at all these cheery faces
of the past.

07:47.364 --> 07:49.490
Eh, I suppose
I could mingle.

07:49.559 --> 07:50.958
Look at them all.

07:51.192 --> 07:53.381
I invited everyone
to this party.

07:53.489 --> 07:54.654
That's right, Scrooge.

07:54.739 --> 07:56.372
Everyone.

07:58.309 --> 08:01.080
Bless me bagpipes!
Goldie!

08:01.145 --> 08:03.736
Mr. McDuck,
Professor Rhutt Betlah,

08:03.801 --> 08:05.814
and have I got a Christmas
present for you.

08:05.879 --> 08:09.412
- Yes, what a lovely rock. Now...
- A perfectly <i> square</i> rock,

08:09.481 --> 08:11.596
procured at some great
personal risk in the Andes.

08:11.661 --> 08:13.666
I'm looking for someone
to finance an expedition.

08:13.731 --> 08:16.295
What? No!
Get out of my...

08:16.418 --> 08:18.650
- Mr. McDuck!
- Mr. McDuck!

08:18.715 --> 08:20.694
- A moment of your time, sir.
- Mr. McDuck,

08:20.784 --> 08:23.100
- have I got an investment for you!
- Move!

08:25.395 --> 08:27.158
Ach!
Even back then,

08:27.223 --> 08:28.549
all everyone wanted
was a piece of

08:28.614 --> 08:30.572
- my fortune.
- Oh, come now, Scrooge.

08:30.637 --> 08:33.623
Not everyone here
is looking for a handout.

08:33.761 --> 08:36.525
McDuck, I come
to take your money

08:36.590 --> 08:39.225
and reclaim Beagleburg
for my kin!

08:39.308 --> 08:41.291
Some of them
just want to rob you.

08:41.356 --> 08:43.697
Bankjob! Babyface!
Bugle!

08:43.761 --> 08:46.244
Take everything
that ain't nailed down!

08:50.092 --> 08:52.869
- Waah! 
-  Hey! You guys go on without me!

08:52.934 --> 08:56.340
I'm gonna stick with this
crazy party crawl!

09:00.222 --> 09:02.295
Looks like
the party's over.

09:02.473 --> 09:04.958
- Let's just get back to my family and... 
- No!

09:05.028 --> 09:08.158
I mean, you deserve a break.
It's Christmas!

09:08.223 --> 09:10.400
Give me one more shot.
I know the perfect party.

09:10.465 --> 09:13.385
No family, no business,
no responsibility.

09:13.450 --> 09:15.416
- Oh, please, please, please?
- Well. I...

09:15.481 --> 09:17.404
Ooh, thank you!

09:22.114 --> 09:23.224
Is this...

09:23.318 --> 09:25.447
Your first Christmas
in Duckburg,

09:25.512 --> 09:28.377
before family and fortune
and business harassed.

09:28.442 --> 09:30.447
It's the perfect Christmas!

09:30.512 --> 09:33.194
Just like you asked!

09:41.140 --> 09:44.154
Now, that is more like it.

09:44.544 --> 09:47.123
No more nagging
responsibilities.

09:47.278 --> 09:49.990
Silent night, indeed.

09:53.527 --> 09:55.795
Curse me kilts,
this is boring.

09:56.239 --> 09:58.963
Now I see your lesson,
specter.

09:59.028 --> 10:00.963
The minor frustrations
of your life

10:01.028 --> 10:03.967
pale in comparison
to the excitement they bring.

10:04.051 --> 10:06.889
Hearth, home, family...

10:07.004 --> 10:08.833
That's what Christmas
is all about.

10:08.898 --> 10:10.824
No more living in the past.

10:10.889 --> 10:12.740
Take me back, spirit.

10:12.855 --> 10:14.543
- No.
- What's that, now?

10:14.723 --> 10:16.753
Every year,
I spend my Christmas

10:16.818 --> 10:20.787
showing selfish ingrates
the true meaning of Christmas,

10:20.855 --> 10:23.463
only to be ditched the following
year because they have to

10:23.528 --> 10:26.669
"look after Tiny Tim"
or whatever.

10:26.777 --> 10:29.463
Blech!
But you were different.

10:29.528 --> 10:31.920
You always
came back to us.

10:32.035 --> 10:35.537
Then your family moved in.

10:35.762 --> 10:38.224
How long before you decide
to have Christmas with them,

10:38.316 --> 10:41.318
and I get left
behind again?!

10:45.480 --> 10:48.037
So I brought you back
where nothing,

10:48.116 --> 10:50.822
not even my fellow spirits,
could distract you

10:50.887 --> 10:53.611
from this glorious Christmas past!

10:53.676 --> 10:56.884
And we can relive it
over and over and over

10:56.949 --> 10:59.546
together forever!

11:13.902 --> 11:15.927
Take that,
ya wistful wisp!

11:23.238 --> 11:25.302
You know,
this is an amazing fight.

11:25.418 --> 11:26.626
I know, right?

11:26.691 --> 11:29.333
What I wouldn't give
to do it over again.

11:29.418 --> 11:32.618
Nostalgia for a fight
that started a minute ago?

11:32.683 --> 11:34.691
Now, that's
living in the past!

11:34.756 --> 11:35.974
Let's do it!

11:37.418 --> 11:39.603
Oh, man,
this is gonna be great!

11:39.668 --> 11:41.319
Uh, where was I?
Oh, right.

11:41.982 --> 11:44.021
Every year...

11:46.281 --> 11:49.802
Ha-ha! Good one, Scrooge!
Get back here.

11:49.894 --> 11:51.939
Or should I say,
"Get back now"?

11:54.293 --> 11:55.637
Scrooge?

11:56.012 --> 11:57.395
Uh...

11:57.707 --> 12:00.302
He'll...
He'll be back.

12:01.561 --> 12:03.407
Take heed, rise,

12:03.472 --> 12:05.240
and walk with me!

12:19.808 --> 12:21.623
Back where I started?

12:21.731 --> 12:24.470
But maybe not
back <i> when</i> I started!

12:24.535 --> 12:27.294
Ha-ha! Good one,
Time Traveler Dewey.

12:27.988 --> 12:30.009
Okay.
If this is really the past,

12:30.074 --> 12:32.615
then I can finally
spend Christmas with...

12:34.191 --> 12:36.547
some weird emo kid?

12:57.011 --> 12:59.427
Who are you?!
How much did you hear?

12:59.492 --> 13:01.458
Did you like it?
Answer me!

13:01.523 --> 13:04.885
Oh, uh, my name
is... Bluey,

13:04.950 --> 13:06.326
your 15th step-cousin

13:06.391 --> 13:08.740
on your great-grandmother's
niece's side

13:08.805 --> 13:11.494
from... Canada, eh?

13:12.062 --> 13:16.174
Oh, this is
the most confusing family.

13:16.318 --> 13:18.537
Wait, wait, wait. If you're
here, where's your sister?

13:18.602 --> 13:21.424
Della?
Same place she is every year:

13:21.489 --> 13:23.536
camped out back,
looking for Santa.

13:23.601 --> 13:26.511
She's right out back? Come on,
you got to help me find her!

13:26.902 --> 13:28.373
No, thanks.

13:28.451 --> 13:30.172
Christmas is a bunch
of kids' stuff.

13:30.240 --> 13:32.601
Plus I'm thi-i-is close

13:32.687 --> 13:34.171
to writing the perfect song.

13:34.257 --> 13:36.286
You're really not.
Snatch!

13:38.006 --> 13:40.130
Hey!
What's the big idea?

13:40.255 --> 13:42.742
I'm comin', Mom!

13:46.007 --> 13:47.732
Give me that!
Oh!

13:48.942 --> 13:51.193
Aw, man, it's all out of tune.

13:52.133 --> 13:54.576
Wait, wait.
I don't hate it.

13:55.098 --> 13:56.176
Stop.

13:56.254 --> 13:57.920
Della's not here.

13:58.808 --> 14:00.795
I think
she was attacked.

14:01.902 --> 14:02.956
Ugh!

14:03.074 --> 14:04.747
Attacked by a case
of the munchies.

14:04.812 --> 14:05.912
It's just jelly.

14:05.988 --> 14:08.072
What would you have
done if it wasn't?

14:08.137 --> 14:11.583
Oh, why is Della making
such a big deal out of this?

14:11.648 --> 14:13.517
She packed
way too much food.

14:13.582 --> 14:15.173
She brought
a family-sized tent

14:15.238 --> 14:17.167
that she couldn't even
set up by herself.

14:17.675 --> 14:19.091
Like so.

14:19.316 --> 14:21.386
Yaah!

14:24.052 --> 14:25.737
How do you explain this?

14:28.551 --> 14:31.654
Well that... is weird.

14:34.176 --> 14:35.810
- Ow.
- Whoops!

14:36.082 --> 14:37.935
Ow. Ow!

14:38.022 --> 14:40.908
So Della must take you on awesome
adventures all the time, huh?

14:40.973 --> 14:43.400
Ah, please.
I'm a little too mature

14:43.465 --> 14:45.548
for adventures
with my sister.

14:45.613 --> 14:49.427
I'm more of the soulful,
devil-may-care loner type.

14:49.568 --> 14:51.917
- Oh, totally. Me too.
- Waah!

14:51.982 --> 14:54.056
But Della is amazing, right?

14:54.121 --> 14:56.753
I mean, why wouldn't you want to go
on a Christmas adventure with her?

14:56.818 --> 14:58.877
She wanted me to, but...

14:58.942 --> 15:01.415
Well, why aren't you
with your family?

15:01.480 --> 15:03.939
The answer to that
is complicated

15:04.004 --> 15:05.882
and full of paradoxes.

15:11.107 --> 15:15.334
Ah. Della's tracks end here,
but the others keep going.

15:15.448 --> 15:18.060
Maybe it gave her
a piggyback ride?

15:18.205 --> 15:20.803
I gave Della this scarf
last Christmas.

15:20.897 --> 15:23.818
She never would have left it
behind unless...

15:25.692 --> 15:27.460
That's not Santa Claus.

15:27.654 --> 15:31.286
Wendigo!

15:42.607 --> 15:45.405
I'll deck your halls,
ya big palooka!

16:03.346 --> 16:05.541
What is happening?

16:07.022 --> 16:09.173
Ugh. You're not
Santa Claus.

16:09.238 --> 16:12.857
Della, you no-good, reckless...

16:14.035 --> 16:15.074
Della?

16:15.152 --> 16:17.938
Squawk, squawk, squawk.
Look who decided to come camping.

16:18.003 --> 16:20.368
Just had to trip
one of my Santa traps.

16:20.433 --> 16:21.963
One day I'll catch
that ho-ho hooligan

16:22.028 --> 16:24.963
and give Uncle Scrooge
the best Christmas gift ever.

16:25.028 --> 16:27.086
This dummy
in your dumb band too?

16:27.178 --> 16:29.008
I am a solo act.

16:29.248 --> 16:32.880
Wendigo!

16:33.014 --> 16:35.964
- What is that thing?
- I'd guess a Wendigo.

16:36.029 --> 16:38.129
Legend has it
that they're poor souls

16:38.194 --> 16:40.543
turned into monsters
by obsession and desperation.

16:40.608 --> 16:43.656
Hurry up and get us down,
Dumbella!

16:44.178 --> 16:47.039
- No. Not until you apologize.
- For what?

16:47.186 --> 16:49.230
- Wrong answer.
- Donald!

16:49.295 --> 16:51.851
Okay. I'm sorry
I called you Dumbella.

16:51.959 --> 16:54.207
- Try again.
- Uh... okay.

16:54.272 --> 16:58.162
I'm sorry I used your toothbrush
to clean my combat boots.

16:58.287 --> 16:59.896
You did what?

17:02.537 --> 17:04.214
You don't even know
what you did wrong.

17:04.279 --> 17:05.410
Typical Donald.

17:05.474 --> 17:07.285
How could I have done
anything wrong?

17:07.349 --> 17:09.089
I haven't seen you
all night!

17:10.185 --> 17:12.685
That's what you did wrong!

17:13.920 --> 17:15.375
That's why
she packed the extra food

17:15.440 --> 17:16.863
and the family-sized tent

17:16.928 --> 17:19.113
and left her scarf behind
for you to follow her.

17:19.178 --> 17:20.800
She didn't care about
finding Santa.

17:20.865 --> 17:22.738
She just wanted to spend
Christmas with you.

17:22.803 --> 17:25.277
But you were too caught up
in your own thing to notice.

17:25.342 --> 17:28.047
Locked in your room,
ignoring everybody.

17:28.154 --> 17:30.935
And I have a lot of apologizing
to do when I get back.

17:31.000 --> 17:33.332
Della, I'm sorry, okay?

17:33.397 --> 17:36.031
I shouldn't have ditched
you on Christmas.

17:40.343 --> 17:42.828
All right, ugly.
What do you want?

17:42.983 --> 17:45.428
Wendigo!

17:45.592 --> 17:48.545
Scrooge!

17:48.661 --> 17:50.851
- Of course.
- Of course.

18:34.664 --> 18:37.859
Wahoo!
Crack-a-roonie!

18:38.589 --> 18:40.034
Now what?

18:47.753 --> 18:50.352
Aw, listen, Della.
I really am sorry.

18:50.417 --> 18:54.387
I promise we'll never spend
another Christmas apart.

18:56.378 --> 18:58.317
Thanks for helping us
back there.

18:59.917 --> 19:02.149
Uh, this is weird.

19:02.214 --> 19:04.636
Sorry. I've just always
wanted to spend Christmas

19:04.701 --> 19:07.196
with my...
15th step-cousin

19:07.261 --> 19:09.117
on my great-grandmother's
niece's side, that was it.

19:09.182 --> 19:11.297
You're a relative
from the future, aren't you?

19:11.362 --> 19:13.753
What? No!

19:13.854 --> 19:16.735
Eh, eh. Please.
We're the Duck family.

19:16.800 --> 19:18.782
This is only like
the fourth weirdest thing

19:18.847 --> 19:20.313
that's happened to us
on Christmas.

19:20.378 --> 19:22.749
Okay, well, I've gotta warn you about
what's gonna happen in the future.

19:22.814 --> 19:24.725
No!
Keep your mouth shut!

19:24.790 --> 19:26.180
You can't warn us
about our future!

19:26.245 --> 19:27.750
You'll disrupt
the time stream!

19:27.815 --> 19:29.936
Haven't you ever seen
any movie?

19:30.001 --> 19:31.848
- Oh, yeah.
- Stay here.

19:31.913 --> 19:34.438
We'll go get Uncle Scrooge
to take care of the beast.

19:45.101 --> 19:47.327
Scrooge!

19:47.632 --> 19:51.391
Here, ya nostalgic
night terror!

19:53.390 --> 19:54.829
Uncle Scrooge?

19:54.905 --> 19:57.059
I was flying these two
back home through time

19:57.124 --> 19:58.309
when I spotted you
down here.

19:58.374 --> 20:01.106
What in blazes are
you doing here... eh, now?

20:01.171 --> 20:02.548
You could've...

20:03.530 --> 20:05.962
Can we please just go
back to our family?

20:13.241 --> 20:14.445
Past?

20:14.585 --> 20:17.813
Wendigos... Poor souls
turned into monsters

20:17.898 --> 20:20.016
by obsession
and desperation.

20:20.234 --> 20:22.868
He's been lost in these
woods this whole time.

20:23.023 --> 20:26.368
Every Christmas Eve...
Waiting for me.

20:29.874 --> 20:32.641
I'm going to give
an old friend a present.

20:34.757 --> 20:37.649
No one gets left behind
on Christmas.

20:39.070 --> 20:40.727
You mean it?

20:43.984 --> 20:47.864
Take heed, rise,
and walk with me!
