00:00.500 --> 00:03.669
My name is Marty Kaan, and
I'm a management consultant.

00:03.670 --> 00:05.669
We need to get them on
the tit. That's what we do.

00:05.870 --> 00:08.599
Suck, motherfucker, suck.
We share a little Intel,

00:08.600 --> 00:12.539
- play both companies against the middle.
- Jeannie: So illegal.

00:12.540 --> 00:13.869
Marty: Not the way we're gonna do it.

00:13.870 --> 00:15.339
Roscoe: Hey, Chantelle.

00:15.340 --> 00:16.040
What in the...?

00:16.041 --> 00:17.399
Grandpa's new friend.

00:17.400 --> 00:18.200
(Chuckles)

00:18.301 --> 00:19.699
I want to do something

00:19.700 --> 00:21.200
really fucking stupid.

00:23.100 --> 00:24.269
I love you.

00:24.970 --> 00:26.399
Who the fuck let the feds

00:26.400 --> 00:27.599
in on this thing in the first place?

00:27.600 --> 00:29.069
I told her about the books.

00:29.070 --> 00:31.139
- Doug: Why?
-Because I wanted the DOJ gig.

00:31.340 --> 00:33.769
Samantha: Jeannie, you're in the
clear. They're letting you skate.

00:33.770 --> 00:35.569
Marty: I guess I taught
you well, huh, Jeannie?

00:35.570 --> 00:37.769
You out-martied Marty Kaan.

00:37.770 --> 00:39.039
Marty, I never meant to...

00:39.040 --> 00:40.369
All I want...

00:40.370 --> 00:41.969
Marty: Is what?

00:41.970 --> 00:43.140
You.

00:43.141 --> 00:44.940
? ?

00:47.700 --> 00:50.370
Marty: I'm done with this bullshit.

(Sighs)

01:17.500 --> 01:20.340
Fuck it.

01:21.940 --> 01:24.899
So, the whole enlightenment
thing wasn't for me.

01:25.200 --> 01:28.399
At least not in the traditional sense.

01:28.400 --> 01:31.399
Some people believe in the
Dharma of non-attachment.

01:31.400 --> 01:35.069
Some people believe in the
Dharma of loving kindness.

01:35.070 --> 01:36.400
Uh...

01:37.770 --> 01:39.099
But I've come to realize

01:39.100 --> 01:42.699
that I believe in the
Dharma of search and destroy.

01:42.700 --> 01:45.839
I believe in the Dharma
of take no prisoners.

01:45.840 --> 01:48.899
I believe in the Dharma of kicking ass.

02:01.170 --> 02:05.799
And yet, at the end of
the day, reality wins.

02:05.800 --> 02:07.469
Okay, listen,

02:07.470 --> 02:10.399
we're just gonna show
up, pay our respects.

02:10.400 --> 02:11.939
No big deal. Just...

02:11.940 --> 02:14.469
Let's be there to keep the
vultures away. Claim our guy.

02:14.470 --> 02:16.440
And we know for a fact he's coming?

02:16.441 --> 02:17.569
That is the word on the street.

02:17.570 --> 02:19.399
Look, I bought a card. From all of us.

02:19.400 --> 02:20.739
"Sorry for your loss," et cetera.

02:20.740 --> 02:25.069
Uh, problem is I think that
the prose is a little florid.

02:25.070 --> 02:28.569
Then maybe we don't do a card
because it's fucking business.

02:28.570 --> 02:30.439
- Also, no card. Definitely no card.
- Clyde: No card, Doug. Ever.

02:30.440 --> 02:32.439
We need to deal with
this rat man situation

02:32.440 --> 02:34.827
because he-he left me, like,
15 messages yesterday.

02:34.852 --> 02:37.799
No, we have set that meeting. He
is just being incredibly needy.

02:37.800 --> 02:39.399
Why does he only ever call Jeannie?

02:39.400 --> 02:41.399
Oh, I don't know. Her boobs.

02:41.400 --> 02:43.539
Mm. Or maybe it's because
I'm brilliant and capable

02:43.540 --> 02:45.199
and exude an air of quiet confidence.

02:45.200 --> 02:47.569
No, I'm sorry. It's because
you got big old boobs.

02:47.570 --> 02:50.639
- You sure? That's why?
- Yeah. Yes, yes, yes. And, by the way,

02:50.640 --> 02:52.639
you have a meeting on the
books. But I think we should run

02:52.640 --> 02:53.445
a couple more models.

02:53.470 --> 02:55.739
- Because if we show the hours.
- I agree.

02:56.140 --> 02:57.899
We can bill for the hours.

02:57.900 --> 02:59.399
- This guy's got a lot of money.
- Oh, of course.

02:59.400 --> 03:01.539
And I plan to take a lot of
his money. In order for him

03:01.540 --> 03:03.799
- to make more money to pay us more money.
- Mmm.

03:03.800 --> 03:05.139
So we can make more money.

03:05.140 --> 03:06.569
I just love it when you
talk about money.

03:06.570 --> 03:08.270
Okay. Let's go.

03:08.371 --> 03:09.739
I think you're gonna regret the card.

03:09.840 --> 03:11.840
(Loud rock music playing)

03:20.200 --> 03:21.869
Yo! Martin Luther Kaan!

03:21.870 --> 03:24.239
What up, my nigga?!

03:24.240 --> 03:26.700
(Music stops)

03:39.440 --> 03:41.769
- (Music resumes)
- Kelsey,

03:41.770 --> 03:42.939
hey.

03:42.940 --> 03:44.369
I forgot to tell you.

03:44.370 --> 03:45.899
Your tattoo artist called this morning.

03:46.100 --> 03:48.839
He was like, "I am so sorry."

03:48.840 --> 03:50.539
He wants to give you all
your money back. He was

03:50.540 --> 03:52.399
actually crying on the phone.

03:52.400 --> 03:54.739
Hey, dude. Um, next time,

03:54.740 --> 03:56.739
just say, "I hate all women."

03:56.740 --> 03:58.669
"But I'm especially
threatened by strong women

03:58.670 --> 04:00.069
who see how broken I am."

04:00.070 --> 04:03.099
(Chuckling)

04:03.100 --> 04:05.499
Looks like someone's been
reading Clyde's diary.

04:05.500 --> 04:08.099
That would be more honest. Um,
and, my friend, a little tip,

04:08.100 --> 04:09.769
I would be nicer to them. Really.

04:09.770 --> 04:11.269
Because they're gonna be stupid rich

04:11.270 --> 04:13.269
- when their stupid app launches.
- The fact that we have to share

04:13.270 --> 04:15.699
a space with those douchy
proto-fascist mavericks

04:15.700 --> 04:17.738
makes me want to strap
a bomb to my chest.

04:17.740 --> 04:20.199
How 'bout you just focus on
getting your numbers up, okay?

04:20.200 --> 04:22.199
Then we can kick 'em out or... kill 'em.

04:22.200 --> 04:25.799
(Phone ringing)

04:25.800 --> 04:27.799
- Don't all fucking jump at once.
- Look at dum-dum.

04:27.800 --> 04:29.083
- don't point to me, and
-  Pick up the phone.

04:29.108 --> 04:29.669
don't call me dum-dum.

04:29.670 --> 04:31.599
- I get it all the time. You get it, Clyde.
- Fuck you!

04:31.600 --> 04:34.069
- Pick up the phone, Doug!
- Excuse me. No, you never say

04:34.070 --> 04:36.239
- what you're supposed to say anyway.
- There's no way I'm saying

04:36.240 --> 04:38.499
"Good morning. Kaan and
associates management"

04:38.500 --> 04:41.039
"and media consultants. This
is Clyde Oberholt speaking."

04:41.040 --> 04:43.099
- How may I direct your call?"
- Why not?! That was perfect!

04:43.100 --> 04:44.599
- It works!
- It's so long! Then show me!

04:44.600 --> 04:46.469
- Fine. Fine. Oh, God.
- Oh, God.

04:46.470 --> 04:48.199
Here we go.

04:48.200 --> 04:50.199
Good morning. Kaan and
associates management

04:50.200 --> 04:50.907
and media consultants.

04:50.932 --> 04:52.899
- Young man: Yeah, nice air!
- This is Doug Guggenheim speaking.

04:52.900 --> 04:54.099
How may I direct your call?

04:54.100 --> 04:56.039
Wait. H-hello?

04:56.040 --> 04:57.439
Damn it.

04:57.440 --> 05:00.339
Don't you guys feel like we're...

05:00.340 --> 05:02.199
A group of crime fighters right now?

05:02.200 --> 05:04.199
- Oh. Ooh, like the seven samurai.
- Not seven, obviously.

05:04.200 --> 05:05.869
There's four of us.
We're the four samurai.

05:05.870 --> 05:07.639
Oh, I think we must look awesome.

05:07.640 --> 05:10.639
Just dressed in black. I wish
we could get a picture of us.

05:10.640 --> 05:12.239
That would be disrespectful,
but you know what I mean.

05:12.240 --> 05:13.499
Maybe just a quick selfie.

05:13.500 --> 05:15.669
Hey, we good, right, Marty? We
good, we good, but we bad.

05:15.670 --> 05:17.299
- (Chuckles)
- Jeannie Bean, right?

05:17.300 --> 05:17.800
You fa-zeel me?

05:18.125 --> 05:20.499
Guggenheim, you have
got to shut the fuck up.

05:20.500 --> 05:22.439
Ooh, ooh, ooh. Like reservoir dogs.

05:22.440 --> 05:24.340
Yes, that's better. Reservoir dogs.

05:26.570 --> 05:28.899
Oh, my god, it's him.

05:28.900 --> 05:31.570
(Car door opens)

05:33.970 --> 05:35.970
Step out.

05:39.240 --> 05:41.240
Your hands.

05:43.500 --> 05:45.169
Let's keep the AC running.

05:45.170 --> 05:47.200
See if you can find me an Espresso, okay?

05:53.700 --> 05:55.540
Hey, brother.

05:57.170 --> 06:00.539
Look at you.

06:00.540 --> 06:02.800
Oh, look at him.

06:04.500 --> 06:06.769
He looks better than he
did when he was alive.

06:06.770 --> 06:09.439
Aw.

06:09.440 --> 06:11.099
You motherless count.

06:11.100 --> 06:13.100
(Hawking)

06:15.470 --> 06:17.739
Who's in the coffin?

06:17.740 --> 06:19.739
Who gives a fuck?

06:19.740 --> 06:21.869
I'll tell you who it ain't,

06:21.870 --> 06:23.799
our boy Ellis Gage Hightower,

06:23.800 --> 06:26.799
CEO of Gage motors, inventor,

06:26.800 --> 06:29.799
bad boy, tax evader,

06:29.800 --> 06:31.799
godhead of electric cars.

06:31.800 --> 06:34.669
No, as you can see,
he's very much alive.

06:34.670 --> 06:38.669
And we are desperate
to close his crazy ass.

06:38.670 --> 06:41.669
This piece of business is
not just millions in the bank.

06:41.670 --> 06:44.269
No, it's-it's legitimacy.

06:44.270 --> 06:46.469
Street cred, vindication.

06:46.470 --> 06:48.469
Hell, it's salvation.

06:48.470 --> 06:52.639
In other words,
it's our ticket out of the shit-shit.

06:52.640 --> 06:54.499
And the loogie.

06:54.500 --> 06:56.499
Eh, don't worry about that.

06:56.500 --> 06:58.939
It's nothing personal.
He'd unload that thing

06:58.940 --> 07:02.199
on any member of his board
of directors. You know why?

07:02.200 --> 07:04.939
Because they don't understand his genius.

07:04.940 --> 07:07.139
Wah. Don't you hate that?

07:07.140 --> 07:10.140
When they don't understand your genius?

07:12.970 --> 07:14.339
Bruce.

07:14.340 --> 07:16.739
(Speaking indistinctly)

07:16.740 --> 07:19.469
You guys know Bruce Karp, my number two.

07:19.470 --> 07:22.669
Hey, buddy. You look good.

07:22.670 --> 07:23.999
You lost weight.

07:24.000 --> 07:25.269
No, I didn't.

07:25.270 --> 07:26.739
No, I guess not.

07:26.740 --> 07:29.739
So, the rollout structure
on the new product,

07:29.740 --> 07:31.899
it cost me a lot to get that
Fedex'd from prison, and...

07:31.900 --> 07:33.299
You know what I was just thinking...

07:33.300 --> 07:35.699
Excuse me. I haven't heard from you.

07:35.700 --> 07:37.699
Yeah, that's right.
Because it was all about you.

07:37.700 --> 07:38.700
The whole thing.

07:38.701 --> 07:40.299
What?

07:40.300 --> 07:42.399
When have I ever put
myself ahead of the work?

07:42.400 --> 07:44.399
Ever since you started
reading your own press.

07:44.400 --> 07:46.499
And campaigning for the nobel prize.

07:46.500 --> 07:47.469
The whole thing

07:47.470 --> 07:50.799
is about positioning the
release of the Phoenix

07:50.800 --> 07:53.369
with your prison release.
What about the integrity of our product?

07:53.370 --> 07:55.599
- I am the product. I am the brand.
- Oh, you're the product.

07:55.600 --> 07:56.000
You're the brand.

07:56.025 --> 07:57.399
How's your new house in
Brentwood, you fat fuck ?

07:57.400 --> 07:59.039
Oh... boy.

07:59.040 --> 08:00.969
You remember the one you earned
by slithering to the mailbox

08:00.970 --> 08:03.469
like Jabba the Hutt to collect
the... unbelievable profits

08:03.470 --> 08:05.899
that were the result of my
groundbreaking design work

08:05.900 --> 08:08.239
on lithium technologies,
which, by the way, will garner

08:08.240 --> 08:09.699
the nobel prize. So don't......

08:09.700 --> 08:11.969
You know what, middle-aged boy genius?

08:11.970 --> 08:13.639
I am sick of your horse shit.

08:13.640 --> 08:15.639
- We're not finished.
- Unbelievable, this guy.

08:15.640 --> 08:17.089
Bruce, you don't just walk
away from me like that.

08:17.114 --> 08:17.999
Doug: Uh, this is bad, Marty.

08:18.000 --> 08:19.939
Yeah it's bad, so bad.

08:19.940 --> 08:21.739
- Bad is good.
- Mm-hmm.

08:21.740 --> 08:23.269
- Good is bad.
- Mmm.

08:23.270 --> 08:24.799
Come on, if it's a love fest

08:24.800 --> 08:28.239
and it's all harmonious in the
business, we're fucking fired.

08:28.240 --> 08:30.169
- (Phone vibrates)
- But if the is coming down from the sky

08:30.170 --> 08:32.438
- in golf ball-size chunks.
- Which it is.

08:32.440 --> 08:34.269
Oh, that's a good day for us.

08:34.270 --> 08:36.568
'Cause we get to swoop in and
put a band-aid on the booboo.

08:36.570 --> 08:37.770
Make it all better.

08:37.770 --> 08:40.239
Chaos, entropy, ka-ching.

08:40.440 --> 08:41.769
Keep going.

08:41.770 --> 08:42.969
- (Indistinct arguing)
- Jeannie: Marty,

08:42.970 --> 08:45.569
rat man has officially gone nuts.

08:45.570 --> 08:47.769
I have 29 new messages.

08:47.770 --> 08:49.099
I think he likes you.

08:49.100 --> 08:51.669
- (Sighs)
- Where is this asshole?

08:51.670 --> 08:53.139
It's fucking hack work.

08:53.140 --> 08:54.469
We're the hottest exterminator company

08:54.470 --> 08:56.269
in Southern California,
but what I'm getting

08:56.270 --> 08:57.939
from Kaan and associates is shit.

08:57.940 --> 08:59.369
It lacks real vision. Your...

08:59.370 --> 09:01.642
Your expansion models
are lackluster at best.

09:01.667 --> 09:02.399
- Okay.

09:02.400 --> 09:05.139
So how could we take it
to the next level for you?

09:05.140 --> 09:06.069
Because a company like

09:06.070 --> 09:08.099
Rathman the rat man deserves real vision

09:08.100 --> 09:09.899
to be truly appreciated.

09:09.900 --> 09:11.769
- Absolutely. So please just don't spray us
- Yeah.

09:11.770 --> 09:14.499
You don't think I hear the contempt in
your clever little comments?

09:15.100 --> 09:16.969
Why don't you go back to
your pretentious downtown loft

09:16.970 --> 09:18.369
and actually try to create

09:18.370 --> 09:22.199
an original business plan for
once in your fucking lives?!

09:22.200 --> 09:23.869
I'm cutting your fee in
half starting right now.

09:23.870 --> 09:24.939
- You're doing what?
- Unless you want me

09:24.940 --> 09:25.999
to walk across the street

09:26.000 --> 09:27.099
to your hot ex-wife,

09:27.100 --> 09:28.439
who's been calling, by the way.

09:28.440 --> 09:30.269
And I got a feeling

09:30.270 --> 09:33.269
that she'd throw me a bang
on top of everything else.

09:33.270 --> 09:34.070
(Rat man laughs)

09:34.071 --> 09:35.339
No wonder K&A

09:35.440 --> 09:36.669
is circling the fucking drain!

09:36.770 --> 09:39.239
K... what? Uh...

09:39.240 --> 09:40.769
K&A is-is cir...

09:40.770 --> 09:41.869
We're circling the fucking drain?

09:42.070 --> 09:43.439
Marty, it's...

09:43.440 --> 09:44.769
Marty, I don't think he
meant that K&A is actually

09:44.770 --> 09:45.939
- circling an actual drain. It's fine, Doug
- Hey, you know what?

09:45.940 --> 09:47.099
You know, I-I agree with you.

09:47.200 --> 09:49.439
K&A is circling the fucking drain.

09:49.440 --> 09:50.099
That's right.

09:50.100 --> 09:51.239
And you know how I know that?

09:51.240 --> 09:53.239
Because we are standing next to

09:53.240 --> 09:54.899
a termite-infested
house talking to an ugly,

09:54.900 --> 09:56.469
rat-looking motherfucker,

09:56.470 --> 09:58.539
with a fifth grade education whose mommy...
- Marty.

09:58.540 --> 09:59.769
Just probably taught him how to dress...

09:59.770 --> 10:02.000
- Marty...
- this morning.

10:07.440 --> 10:10.570
- (Knocking)
- (Distant siren blaring)

10:12.900 --> 10:15.139
- No, Jeannie.
- Yes, Marty. Marty.

10:15.140 --> 10:17.599
Jeannie, I told you
I don't want to see you now, okay?

10:17.600 --> 10:19.539
Oh, would you please not be so girly?

10:19.540 --> 10:21.469
I mean, I have showed up...

10:21.470 --> 10:22.999
- Yeah.
- On your doorstep, Marty.

10:23.000 --> 10:25.299
It's very late at night, I'm
not wearing any underwear.

10:25.300 --> 10:25.775
Okay.

10:25.800 --> 10:27.199
And it's 'cause I want to give
you something to think about

10:27.200 --> 10:29.069
- while you're away.
- No, it's because you're drunk.

10:29.070 --> 10:30.269
Oh, you're so girly.

10:30.270 --> 10:32.039
- Jeannie, you got to go, okay?
- Hey.

10:32.040 --> 10:35.439
The non-girly Marty would at
least throw me a revenge fuck.

10:35.440 --> 10:37.769
- Am I right? Just one more.
- You got to get out.

10:37.770 --> 10:39.799
- Marty.
- (Sighs)

10:39.800 --> 10:41.199
I'm not good with begging.

10:41.200 --> 10:43.799
Please help me out here.

10:43.800 --> 10:45.969
Jeannie, give me your hands.

10:45.970 --> 10:48.699
- Okay. Goo...
- (Laughs)

10:48.700 --> 10:50.339
Okay. Okay.

10:50.340 --> 10:52.669
- Now get out.
- No.

10:52.670 --> 10:57.369
Mmm.

10:57.370 --> 10:59.100
(Sighs)

11:13.340 --> 11:15.599
(Sighs)

11:15.600 --> 11:18.940
(Moans)

11:19.940 --> 11:22.839
(Moans)

11:22.840 --> 11:25.169
(Moaning)

11:25.170 --> 11:29.900
(Panting)

11:31.700 --> 11:34.369
(Jeannie gasps)

11:34.370 --> 11:35.899
(Panting)

11:35.900 --> 11:38.099
Jesus Christ. No.

11:38.100 --> 11:39.640
No.

11:41.170 --> 11:46.170
Marty?

11:48.200 --> 11:49.970
You-you got to go.

11:57.200 --> 11:59.199
Jeannie.

11:59.200 --> 12:01.140
(Sniffles)

12:14.100 --> 12:16.100
Jeannie: Marty.

12:18.900 --> 12:22.999
Listen, Rob, is it
okay if I call you Rob?

12:23.000 --> 12:24.599
Sure.

12:24.600 --> 12:27.999
Rob, I... have...

12:28.000 --> 12:29.999
(Sighs)

12:30.000 --> 12:31.999
Nightmares about you.

12:32.000 --> 12:33.799
- God, no. Whoops.
- (Laughs)

12:33.800 --> 12:35.069
You mean dreams.

12:35.070 --> 12:37.099
No, they're nightmares
because I'm paralyzed

12:37.100 --> 12:38.999
or tied up, and you're

12:39.000 --> 12:41.239
sniffing up me on me like a rat on...

12:41.240 --> 12:42.769
something... whatever it is rats like.

12:42.770 --> 12:44.339
- Cheese. They love cheese.
- It's very...

12:44.340 --> 12:47.069
disturbing, I've spent a decent
amount of time on it in therapy,

12:47.070 --> 12:48.999
so I am also ready to tell you

12:49.000 --> 12:50.939
to go fuck yourself
with your lousy business.

12:50.940 --> 12:52.139
Yeah, not the first time

12:52.140 --> 12:53.799
I've been compared unfavorably to a rat.

12:53.800 --> 12:55.839
Your lousy business, which,

12:55.840 --> 12:58.499
if you hired Shakespeare,

12:58.500 --> 13:01.169
Dostoevsky and Jesus Christ...

13:01.170 --> 13:03.299
Could never make it
sound like anything more

13:03.300 --> 13:05.339
than the hot, steaming turd that it is.

13:05.340 --> 13:06.669
Oh, you go, pregnant lady.

13:06.670 --> 13:08.569
- I need a sandwich.
- She needs a fucking sandwich.

13:08.570 --> 13:10.239
- And some ice cream.
- Ice cream.

13:10.240 --> 13:11.869
And some fucking sweet potato fries.

13:11.870 --> 13:13.539
Sweet potato fucking fries.

13:13.540 --> 13:15.099
That was fantastic. You know I loved it.

13:15.100 --> 13:16.999
But does it mean that we're
not gonna get paid again?

13:17.300 --> 13:19.139
Are you crazy? You know we can't afford

13:19.140 --> 13:20.769
to lose even this shitty account, right?

13:20.770 --> 13:22.139
We're broke, completely broke.

13:22.140 --> 13:23.169
We can fix this.

13:23.170 --> 13:24.799
Why don't we go back, talk
to him? He'll understand.

13:25.100 --> 13:26.969
You know, Jeannie's a crazy pregnant lady,

13:26.970 --> 13:28.499
and Marty's an angry black man...

13:28.500 --> 13:31.069
Douglas, why don't we stop right
there at misogyny and racism

13:31.070 --> 13:32.869
unless you want to do the hat trick

13:32.870 --> 13:34.239
and compliment Osama Bin Laden again?

13:34.240 --> 13:35.399
- Hey, hey!
- Hey, hey!

13:35.400 --> 13:37.139
I said he was a brilliant strategist!

13:37.140 --> 13:38.139
- That's a hat trick.
- There is a difference.

13:38.140 --> 13:39.299
Boys. Just go close him, Doug.

13:39.300 --> 13:40.299
- . Yeah?
- Yeah.

13:40.300 --> 13:41.199
- Can you do it by yourself?
- Go back.

13:41.200 --> 13:42.368
- You trust me?
- Marty: Yes.

13:42.393 --> 13:43.099
Yes, dude. Do it by yourself.

13:43.123 --> 13:44.499
All right, you won't ditch me?
You'll stay here?

13:44.500 --> 13:46.269
- Yes, of course.
- Nobody's ditching you.

13:46.270 --> 13:48.270
Okay. All right, wish me luck.

13:49.770 --> 13:53.100
- Hey, are you ditching me?
- Marty, that's leaving.

13:59.240 --> 14:01.240
(Wheel on Marty's chair rolling)

14:03.840 --> 14:07.469
Well, I think this is going pretty well.

14:07.470 --> 14:09.899
I mean, we're at least
getting the work done.

14:09.900 --> 14:12.140
We'll have some billable hours this month.

14:16.740 --> 14:18.739
What? I'm sorry.

14:18.740 --> 14:21.669
I was just saying, um, working together...

14:21.670 --> 14:25.069
I thought it was going
to be harder, uh, after

14:25.070 --> 14:26.839
everything and especially

14:26.840 --> 14:28.599
given the fact that I'm pregnant.

14:28.600 --> 14:29.899
(Clears her throat)

14:29.900 --> 14:33.899
And all the obvious
awkwardness between you and I.

14:33.900 --> 14:36.539
I was saying that I think
that it's going pretty well.

14:36.540 --> 14:38.299
Yeah, not really.

14:38.300 --> 14:42.039
Well, not business-wise, but
I think, between you and I...

14:42.040 --> 14:45.600
I don't think that's really
going too good at all.

14:46.770 --> 14:49.969
I need you... for now,

14:49.970 --> 14:53.239
but I can't really get over
everything that's happened.

14:53.240 --> 14:57.069
I mean, I'd like to,
I'm trying to, but, uh,

14:57.070 --> 14:58.439
- it's not happening.
- (Clears her throat)

14:58.440 --> 15:00.439
And I don't mean to sound like
a pussy about this, but I think...

15:00.540 --> 15:03.239
I was gonna say, 'cause you
kind of sound like a pussy.

15:03.240 --> 15:05.369
We need to just get
through this transition,

15:05.370 --> 15:08.099
and then you should leave for good.

15:08.100 --> 15:13.569
Wait. As in... leave... the company?

15:13.570 --> 15:14.569
Yeah.

15:14.570 --> 15:16.369
Our company that I own

15:16.370 --> 15:17.699
- 50% of?
- Yup.

15:17.700 --> 15:20.399
That I built with you,
and that I kept running

15:20.500 --> 15:21.669
while you were indisposed?

15:21.670 --> 15:22.339
And-and that-that

15:22.340 --> 15:24.099
you burnt down in a fucking spectacular way

15:24.100 --> 15:26.299
- with your lies and deceit.
- (Groans)

15:26.300 --> 15:28.269
- And your bullshit.
- Marty, I have told you I never...

15:28.270 --> 15:30.399
- That you somehow got away scot-free.
- You were not intended to be

15:30.400 --> 15:31.143
in the middle.

15:31.168 --> 15:32.971
What the fuck your
intentions were, Jeannie?

15:32.971 --> 15:34.399
Your actions trumped them.

15:34.800 --> 15:39.299
So, what, I'm just supposed
to walk into the marketplace,

15:39.300 --> 15:41.300
um, eight months pregnant?

15:45.040 --> 15:47.039
Look, uh...

15:47.040 --> 15:48.599
Edgar... ed... what's... Edwin?

15:48.600 --> 15:51.439
- Edwin. Still.
- Yeah. Let him take care of you.

15:51.440 --> 15:52.599
That's mean.

15:52.600 --> 15:53.799
Dude's a lawyer, right?

15:53.800 --> 15:55.469
He doesn't make enough money to fucking

15:55.470 --> 15:57.069
- take care of...? I don't...
- You know, I-I'm

15:57.070 --> 15:59.699
not planning on
dropping everything that I have

15:59.700 --> 16:01.469
- and becoming dependent on a man.
- Okay.

16:01.470 --> 16:03.199
- You know what? Uh, I...
- Just because... by the way,

16:03.200 --> 16:04.499
- who you...
- Okay, okay.

16:04.800 --> 16:07.340
I'm sorry. That's none of my business.

16:08.500 --> 16:10.539
That's okay.

16:10.540 --> 16:11.839
This is what it's gonna be like.

16:11.840 --> 16:12.699
I mean, you think

16:12.700 --> 16:14.299
it's ever gonna be any
different than this?

16:14.300 --> 16:16.339
Than what? Than-than this.

16:16.340 --> 16:18.139
We're gonna be able to
work together for a minute,

16:18.140 --> 16:19.369
and then we're gonna hurt each other.

16:19.370 --> 16:20.599
And then we'll get over it,

16:20.600 --> 16:22.099
and we'll be able to work together,

16:22.100 --> 16:23.239
and we're gonna hurt each other again.

16:23.240 --> 16:25.399
It's cyclical. Come on.

16:25.500 --> 16:27.499
It's like a...

16:27.500 --> 16:29.939
A wound just heals just enough,

16:29.940 --> 16:33.269
and then we rip the scab
off of the fucking thing.

16:33.270 --> 16:35.270
(Sighs)

16:39.400 --> 16:41.569
It didn't have to go this way, Marty.

16:41.570 --> 16:45.770
- I mean, I really wanted to...
- No, but it did.

16:46.770 --> 16:49.240
(Keyboard keys clicking)

17:01.500 --> 17:02.999
(Sniffles)

17:03.000 --> 17:05.069
(Sighs)

17:09.200 --> 17:11.200
(Keyboard keys clicking)

17:14.970 --> 17:17.039
(Whooshing and clicking)

17:17.040 --> 17:19.269
Oh, I'm so kicking your ass right now.

17:19.270 --> 17:21.569
And I am so getting ripped

17:21.569 --> 17:23.640
while you're kicking my ass.

17:24.670 --> 17:26.969
Ooh. Curls for the girls, huh?

17:26.970 --> 17:29.969
Hmm? Oh. Yeah, I guess. Whatever.

17:29.970 --> 17:31.199
No, I'm not...

17:31.200 --> 17:33.199
You know, it doesn't matter
who you're doing the curls for.

17:33.500 --> 17:34.539
- It just looks like you're getting
- Dad, dad...

17:34.540 --> 17:36.199
little jacked up, and I...

17:36.200 --> 17:38.539
I heard the saying before. It's okay.

17:39.140 --> 17:42.569
Hey, I texted you a
couple times last night.

17:42.570 --> 17:44.339
Uh, never heard anything back.

17:44.340 --> 17:47.339
I have, like, 260 unread texts.

17:47.340 --> 17:50.169
260? That's entirely too many.

17:50.170 --> 17:52.039
Wanted to see if you wanted to go

17:52.040 --> 17:53.269
catch a movie or something, but

17:53.270 --> 17:54.739
what did you end up doing?

17:55.140 --> 17:56.599
Um, just hung out.

17:56.600 --> 17:58.599
With?

17:58.600 --> 18:01.270
Uh, Greggo, Skyler, Tom-Tom and Ethan.

18:02.970 --> 18:04.999
Wait a minute.

18:05.000 --> 18:06.999
Are you guys playing the new Xbox?

18:07.000 --> 18:09.269
500 gig and surround.

18:09.270 --> 18:12.169
The one we talked about you
might get for your birthday?

18:12.170 --> 18:14.099
Yeah, totally.

18:14.100 --> 18:15.439
- (Laughs)
- It's pretty awesome.

18:15.440 --> 18:17.039
Yeah, did grandpa...?

18:17.040 --> 18:18.499
Is this because...?

18:18.500 --> 18:19.939
I'm gonna go meditate.

18:19.940 --> 18:22.039
No, no. Meditate on the answer.

18:22.040 --> 18:24.039
We talked about it. `
That's why... I... I didn't...

18:24.040 --> 18:25.869
No, dad, dad. Dad, no, grandpa hates it.

18:25.870 --> 18:28.039
I had some money left over
from mom's Christmas money.

18:28.040 --> 18:29.199
I bought it.

18:29.200 --> 18:30.499
That's a lot of leftovers.

18:30.500 --> 18:32.799
Yeah, she's trying
to, like, buy my love,

18:32.800 --> 18:35.099
even though she's not
even sure she wants it.

18:35.100 --> 18:37.499
It's what you call...

18:37.500 --> 18:38.500
A hedge,

18:38.501 --> 18:39.639
if you didn't know.

18:39.640 --> 18:43.999
Roscoe, why don't you give our
family the benefit of the doubt?

18:44.000 --> 18:46.139
Hey, man, you know, I try,

18:46.140 --> 18:49.039
but sometimes it just is what it is.

18:49.040 --> 18:50.199
What's that supposed to mean?

18:50.200 --> 18:51.499
Would you like me to state it

18:51.500 --> 18:52.699
more obviously for you, dad?

18:52.700 --> 18:54.599
- Yeah, I think you better.
- Roscoe,

18:54.600 --> 18:57.399
why don't we get off of
the hurtful stuff, huh?

18:57.400 --> 18:59.269
Grandpa'll make everybody
some cappuccino, okay?

18:59.270 --> 19:00.669
That is a great idea.

19:00.670 --> 19:02.769
He's getting really good with the foam.

19:02.770 --> 19:05.839
Grandpa, you can't just shuffle
around here with your girlfriend.

19:05.840 --> 19:07.699
And try to make shit out of bon appetit.
- Hey, hey,

19:07.700 --> 19:10.869
Hey, hey, hey. That's it, okay? Enough.
- Enough?

19:10.870 --> 19:12.099
And then what, dad?

19:12.100 --> 19:13.669
What, is it getting too real for you?

19:13.670 --> 19:15.099
Is it reminding you of, like, hard times?

19:15.100 --> 19:16.739
I'm about to make it very real for you

19:16.740 --> 19:18.199
- if you don't knock it off.
- Okay,

19:18.200 --> 19:20.199
okay, s... okay, okay,
that's enough, now.

19:20.200 --> 19:21.569
Back up.

19:21.570 --> 19:23.570
Roscoe.

19:30.170 --> 19:31.969
(Quick sigh)

19:31.970 --> 19:34.139
Look, I... I know you're upset

19:34.140 --> 19:35.899
about everything that happened...

19:35.900 --> 19:37.139
- Dad...
- last year, and I'm really...

19:37.140 --> 19:39.239
Yeah. I'm sorry.

19:39.240 --> 19:41.469
- Okay?
- I'm-I'm sorry, too. That's what I'm...

19:41.770 --> 19:43.939
We're all good, Marty. You
don't have to worry about me.

19:43.940 --> 19:45.300
Stop calling me Marty.

19:47.540 --> 19:48.969
Crap.

19:48.970 --> 19:50.439
Got to go.

19:50.440 --> 19:51.799
You got... where are you going?

19:51.800 --> 19:53.539
I told Ethan that I would

19:53.540 --> 19:55.339
study with him for AP U.S.

19:55.340 --> 19:57.599
You told Ethan?

19:57.600 --> 20:00.099
- Yeah, I told Ethan.
- Did you ask me?

20:00.100 --> 20:03.069
Okay.

20:03.070 --> 20:05.639
Hey, dad. Is it okay with
you if I go study with...

20:05.640 --> 20:07.699
- Man, get out of here.
- Thank you.

20:07.700 --> 20:11.239
Stop worrying. Seriously.

20:11.240 --> 20:13.269
- Call me when you get to Ethan's.
- Wouldn't that be

20:13.270 --> 20:15.900
so cool if I actually did that?

20:19.340 --> 20:20.839
So, was I that bad?

20:20.840 --> 20:23.499
No. Much worse.

20:23.500 --> 20:25.599
Much, much worse.

20:25.600 --> 20:27.299
? ?

20:27.300 --> 20:29.669

20:29.670 --> 20:31.339

22:26.940 --> 22:28.940
? come on, come on. ?

22:33.700 --> 22:34.939
Jeannie Bean.

22:34.940 --> 22:37.769
Marty Kaan.

22:37.870 --> 22:40.199
- Sweet prison wear.
- (Soft chuckle)

22:40.200 --> 22:42.270
Why, thank you.

22:46.840 --> 22:48.840
Wow.

22:51.900 --> 22:53.639
- Sorry.
- Don't.

22:53.640 --> 22:55.139
I'm not gonna cry.

22:55.140 --> 22:57.699
- Good.
- You don't need all my...

22:57.700 --> 22:59.869
- On top of... everything else.
- I know. I really don't, Jeannie.

22:59.870 --> 23:01.870
- I really don't.
- Okay.

23:04.200 --> 23:06.169
I just feel like... because
it's all my fault... that...

23:06.170 --> 23:07.469
Listen, look,

23:07.470 --> 23:09.569
I don't really want to go down the regrets

23:09.570 --> 23:11.644
and recriminations
route today, all right?

23:11.669 --> 23:12.469
Okay.

23:12.470 --> 23:14.369
I took the plea deal

23:14.370 --> 23:16.099
- so that I could get back to work faster.
- Mm-hmm.

23:16.100 --> 23:18.039
I did this. This is my responsibility.

23:18.040 --> 23:20.899
This part of it, anyway. The rest of it...

23:20.900 --> 23:23.699
You can keep.

23:23.700 --> 23:25.739
So let's just go through
the financials, okay?

23:25.740 --> 23:28.140
I'm pregnant, Marty.

23:34.140 --> 23:35.969
(Short exhale)

23:35.970 --> 23:37.470
Are you telling me that we're...

23:38.540 --> 23:39.740
It's not...

23:41.940 --> 23:45.699
No. Um, after...

23:45.700 --> 23:48.099
Everything between us, after I

23:48.100 --> 23:49.969
showed up at your house

23:49.970 --> 23:52.299
like a drunken idiot, I rekindled something

23:52.300 --> 23:56.099
with an old college Beau... Edwin.

23:56.100 --> 23:58.639
Um... Ed-Edwin?

23:58.640 --> 24:00.639
Please don't start.

24:00.640 --> 24:02.669
He's a really decent guy. We're gonna try

24:02.670 --> 24:04.099
to make something work
even though he lives

24:04.100 --> 24:07.069
- in New York, and...
- Wow.

24:07.070 --> 24:08.239
I know.

24:08.240 --> 24:10.439
And I'm definitely...

24:10.440 --> 24:11.939
going to keep the baby.

24:11.940 --> 24:13.940
Mm.

24:17.800 --> 24:19.669
- (Sniffles)
- Which is not something I ever thought

24:19.670 --> 24:23.039
I would hear myself saying,
because I did have all of this

24:23.040 --> 24:24.639
mapped out... I had my eggs frozen,

24:24.640 --> 24:26.839
I was gonna find the perfect sperm, and

24:26.840 --> 24:29.069
it would have all the
characteristics that I lacked,

24:29.070 --> 24:31.069
so that all my faults and imperfections

24:31.070 --> 24:32.839
would be erased in my child, and then

24:32.840 --> 24:35.569
I was gonna raise said child on my own,

24:35.570 --> 24:37.569
with no one else. I had it all mapped out

24:37.570 --> 24:38.799
that it would be me and this baby,

24:38.800 --> 24:40.339
and we'd go to the, you know,

24:40.340 --> 24:43.099
beach and the park and
then fishing and camping and

24:43.100 --> 24:44.999
stuff that I don't do,
but I would do with her.

24:45.000 --> 24:47.199
We'd have long talks about
important... and I would be

24:47.200 --> 24:49.069
all over the stuff

24:49.070 --> 24:51.400
my parents never were. But then...

24:53.570 --> 24:55.499
there was...

24:55.500 --> 24:57.500
Edwin.

24:59.170 --> 25:02.639
I wasn't gonna have the abortion.

25:02.640 --> 25:05.370
And he was willing, so...

25:07.100 --> 25:09.199
I guess I wanted a baby more than

25:09.200 --> 25:12.500
I wanted some perfect,
hermetically sealed life.

25:13.570 --> 25:15.570
(Keys jangling)

25:18.300 --> 25:20.269
Okay.

25:21.370 --> 25:23.469
Obviously, we will figure something out...

25:23.470 --> 25:25.369
- Edwin and I... as it gets closer.
- Oh, you know, Jeannie...

25:25.370 --> 25:27.039
No, it's...

25:27.040 --> 25:29.239
It's none of my business, really.

25:29.240 --> 25:31.569
I know it's none of your business, Marty,

25:31.570 --> 25:34.769
but could you have a
feeling about it, at least?

25:34.770 --> 25:37.669
Congratulations.

25:37.670 --> 25:39.739
- That's it?
- Jeannie, don't push it.

25:39.740 --> 25:42.899
- I'm in fucking prison.
- Okay, all right, sorry.

25:42.900 --> 25:44.900
(Jeannie sighs)

25:53.100 --> 25:55.999
Is that Ellis Hightower?

25:56.000 --> 25:58.000
The electric car guy?

26:00.170 --> 26:01.669
Yeah, I guess it is.

26:03.370 --> 26:04.999
What do I have to do to get in here?

26:05.000 --> 26:07.569
Commit a felony, grow a penis.

26:07.570 --> 26:10.239
Wait a minute, I think you
already did one of those.

26:10.240 --> 26:12.270
Well, I'm gonna work on that penis.

26:14.500 --> 26:16.502
I know you don't want to talk
about anything specifically.

26:16.527 --> 26:17.169
Oh, my God.

26:17.170 --> 26:19.023
And that's fine. I just...
I need you to hear me.

26:19.048 --> 26:19.839
I really don't want , to talk ab...

26:19.840 --> 26:23.569
say that I'm sorry, Maty.

26:23.570 --> 26:25.570
I'm sorry.

26:31.100 --> 26:32.600
Okay.

26:35.170 --> 26:37.739
(Deep breath, exhales)

26:37.740 --> 26:40.740
I think that should be updated.

26:44.340 --> 26:46.340
- These are the quarterlies?
- Yeah.

26:58.600 --> 27:01.099
(Quietly): Fuck you.

27:01.100 --> 27:03.100
Fuck you!

27:04.500 --> 27:06.500
? All is forgiven ?

27:08.640 --> 27:11.999
? all is forgiven ?

27:12.000 --> 27:14.739
?ay-ooh-ay ?

27:14.740 --> 27:16.740
? all is forgiven ?

27:19.370 --> 27:21.370
? all is forgiven ?

27:23.400 --> 27:25.069
? sometimes I think about ?

27:25.070 --> 27:27.739
? things before they happen ?

27:27.740 --> 27:29.539
? floating around ?

27:29.540 --> 27:32.439
? in my head for a while ?

27:32.440 --> 27:34.439
? all of a sudden ?

27:34.440 --> 27:37.439
? it's grown too big to handle ?
