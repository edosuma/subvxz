00:08.490 --> 00:11.073
(gentle music)

00:33.570 --> 00:35.620
- Rachel, it's just every time

00:35.620 --> 00:37.577
I try to make a change for myself I..

00:38.444 --> 00:39.277
- I've been trying what you said

00:39.277 --> 00:42.850
and asking for what I want,
but nothing's changing.

00:42.850 --> 00:44.450
It's just like people would
rather punch themselves

00:44.450 --> 00:46.600
in the throat than interact with me.

00:46.600 --> 00:49.189
- Remind me of what it is you want.

00:49.189 --> 00:50.277
- I don't know,

00:50.277 --> 00:51.370
(gentle knocking on door)

00:51.370 --> 00:52.940
a steady paycheck.

00:52.940 --> 00:55.290
- I'm here to be your accountability.

00:55.290 --> 01:00.290
The point being is that
this'll take some time.

01:00.690 --> 01:01.523
- Time?

01:02.370 --> 01:03.203
I don't have time.

01:03.203 --> 01:04.069
- Like, okay, forget the debt.

01:04.069 --> 01:06.250
I just don't really know what I'm doing.

01:06.250 --> 01:08.290
Like, what am I really good for at this?

01:08.290 --> 01:10.340
I dunno... nothing.

01:10.340 --> 01:13.930
- Have you considered the culinary arts?

01:13.930 --> 01:14.940
- Cooking?

01:14.940 --> 01:16.580
No, never.

01:16.580 --> 01:18.690
Isn't that something that
only poor people have to,

01:18.690 --> 01:19.523
you know, do ?

01:19.523 --> 01:21.490
- I have to go to work, run my business.

01:21.490 --> 01:23.240
Go take my dog to the chiropractor.

01:24.954 --> 01:26.428
I don't have time.

01:26.428 --> 01:29.678
- Now, what is it that you really want?

01:33.570 --> 01:35.266
- I want a haircut.

01:35.266 --> 01:37.550
(music slowing down)

01:37.550 --> 01:38.803
Maybe some new shoes.

01:39.910 --> 01:40.743
Yeah.

01:41.630 --> 01:44.730
- Give yourself permission to
connect with what drives you.

01:44.730 --> 01:47.350
What I'm trying to say is that

01:49.450 --> 01:51.116
I love you,

01:51.116 --> 01:54.833
but it doesn't matter if
you don't love yourself.

01:56.450 --> 01:58.102
- You know what?

01:58.102 --> 01:59.852
It's exactly what I needed to hear.

02:00.800 --> 02:03.370
I'm gonna do it, I'm gonna talk to him.

02:03.370 --> 02:06.030
- Yes, share your thoughts with your man.

02:06.030 --> 02:09.842
There's likely something
more internal going on.

02:10.800 --> 02:12.460
- And if he doesn't listen?

02:12.460 --> 02:15.410
- We could talk about it at
our next session in three days.

02:16.300 --> 02:17.700
- Love you.

02:17.700 --> 02:18.533
So ready.

02:19.650 --> 02:22.544
Oh, this month's payment is coming late.

02:22.544 --> 02:23.600
I didn't want you to think that I-

02:23.600 --> 02:24.940
- Don't stress it.

02:24.940 --> 02:27.470
I just powered through like
a hundred free consultations,

02:27.470 --> 02:30.710
so this takes time.

02:30.710 --> 02:32.850
We're just getting started.

02:32.850 --> 02:33.683
Talk soon.

02:48.174 --> 02:51.174
(rapidly breathing)

03:29.750 --> 03:30.583
Hello.

03:56.849 --> 04:00.349
(gentle melancholy music)

04:12.084 --> 04:14.834
(gentle sobbing)

04:17.192 --> 04:20.024
(gentle knocking)

04:49.796 --> 04:52.046
(groaning)

05:12.682 --> 05:13.913
- I am sorry about that.

05:23.630 --> 05:25.493
Thanks for coming to my rescue friend.

05:28.900 --> 05:31.783
I'm Brady, we talked a couple of days ago.

05:33.090 --> 05:33.973
Polar vortex?

05:34.890 --> 05:35.723
No?

05:40.050 --> 05:42.850
Anyway, I don't know,
this might be bad timing,

05:42.850 --> 05:45.483
but I thought if you're
free some time we could,

05:49.825 --> 05:50.658
maybe not.

05:58.400 --> 06:00.490
(groaning)

06:00.490 --> 06:01.907
- You're welcome.

06:08.297 --> 06:10.880
(gentle music)

06:12.340 --> 06:14.450
19 ounces, divided by

06:16.707 --> 06:18.374
four, we'll call it,

06:23.812 --> 06:24.729
4.8 ounces.

07:49.662 --> 07:52.495
(gentle knocking)

07:54.517 --> 07:56.253
- Hey honey, here's your mail,

07:57.420 --> 07:58.253
garbage?

07:59.620 --> 08:01.961
- Yes, of course, that's okay.

08:01.961 --> 08:02.794
- No rush.

08:15.220 --> 08:16.380
- Thanks so much.

08:16.380 --> 08:19.099
- Oh and sweetie by the way,

08:19.099 --> 08:21.960
I was just gonna tell you it
was so nice to see you out,

08:21.960 --> 08:24.470
quite the fall, how are the groceries?

08:24.470 --> 08:28.163
- Right, lost my jelly.

08:30.240 --> 08:32.850
- Sweetie, your mom called and she-

08:32.850 --> 08:33.897
- No thank you.

08:35.489 --> 08:37.203
- No, no, no, you're right.

08:37.203 --> 08:38.486
Okay.
- Okay.

08:38.486 --> 08:43.486
- Bye honey.

08:43.859 --> 08:46.442
(gentle music)

09:36.390 --> 09:37.853
- Life, volume one.

09:39.415 --> 09:41.287
Why aren't you outside right now?

09:47.620 --> 09:49.220
That's the beauty of it.

09:49.220 --> 09:50.720
You're doing it.

09:50.720 --> 09:54.490
- It's true and I don't know.

09:54.490 --> 09:56.870
It's like everything's been so amazing.

09:56.870 --> 09:58.200
Like, is this real life?

09:58.200 --> 09:59.313
- Oh my God, yes.

10:00.550 --> 10:04.063
I love hearing it, girl, the
goddess of fanny packs is here.

10:06.320 --> 10:09.010
- Okay, so I'm celebrating,

10:09.010 --> 10:12.313
by taking a trip to Hawaii and Rachel,

10:13.170 --> 10:14.520
I want you to come with me.

10:16.499 --> 10:18.240
- I..

10:18.240 --> 10:22.230
- It's on me, you've been
too good to me for too long.

10:22.230 --> 10:25.180
Helping me become who
I've always dreamed of,

10:25.180 --> 10:26.793
please, what do you say?

10:28.220 --> 10:29.430
- I can't.

10:29.430 --> 10:30.840
- What do you mean?

10:30.840 --> 10:34.790
- Travel, it's just, you go,

10:34.790 --> 10:35.660
celebrate.

10:35.660 --> 10:39.200
- Rachel, it's Hawaii with me.

10:39.200 --> 10:40.879
Why don't you just think about it and-

10:40.879 --> 10:43.410
- No, I can't.

10:43.410 --> 10:44.243
No.

10:45.602 --> 10:47.550
- Well, listen, I was hoping
to give you the good news

10:47.550 --> 10:51.500
over the trip, but I don't know.

10:53.856 --> 10:54.939
- What is it?

10:55.970 --> 11:00.480
- I think I'm ready to graduate.

11:00.480 --> 11:01.563
- Graduating?

11:04.300 --> 11:05.163
That's amazing.

11:06.950 --> 11:08.073
- I'm gonna miss this.

11:09.875 --> 11:12.200
(laughing)

11:12.200 --> 11:13.060
- What?

11:13.060 --> 11:14.883
- Putting myself out there again,

11:15.930 --> 11:17.423
has been so great.

11:20.393 --> 11:22.173
(laughing)

11:22.173 --> 11:25.490
I'm sorry, I'm being selfish about this.

11:25.490 --> 11:28.660
- No, no, you should be proud of yourself.

11:28.660 --> 11:29.633
That's amazing.

11:31.750 --> 11:32.890
Look,

11:32.890 --> 11:37.350
just keep doing what you're doing,

11:37.350 --> 11:38.800
we'll catch up at some point.

11:40.500 --> 11:43.433
I'll send an email regarding
this being our last session.

11:46.160 --> 11:47.673
Enjoy Hawaii, okay?

11:50.088 --> 11:52.500
- So I guess this is it?

11:53.860 --> 11:54.943
- I guess so.

11:56.745 --> 11:58.330
- Love you.

11:58.330 --> 11:59.580
- Love you too.

12:00.443 --> 12:01.276
Bye.

12:07.505 --> 12:10.088
(gentle music)

12:53.293 --> 12:54.126
I'm not,

12:56.191 --> 12:57.441
needed anymore.

13:02.931 --> 13:06.264
(gentle dramatic music)

13:07.369 --> 13:10.369
(beating heartbeat)

13:12.245 --> 13:15.245
(breathing rapidly)

13:20.692 --> 13:22.942
(coughing)

14:01.430 --> 14:03.090
Mom.

14:03.090 --> 14:04.790
- Rachel everything okay?

14:05.659 --> 14:06.492
- I need help.

14:07.380 --> 14:09.974
- Honey you need to see a doctor.

14:09.974 --> 14:11.310
- No I don't.

14:11.310 --> 14:12.677
- Where are you right now?

14:14.378 --> 14:15.211
- It's been a
week since you called.

14:15.211 --> 14:16.400
- It's just,

14:16.400 --> 14:19.550
it's just, do you know anyone who needs..

14:19.550 --> 14:20.790
- I can pay for your ticket.

14:20.790 --> 14:22.101
You-

14:22.101 --> 14:22.934
- Stop you're not listening to me,

14:22.934 --> 14:24.701
I don't wanna see you.

14:24.701 --> 14:27.923
(exclaiming in frustration)

14:27.923 --> 14:30.090
(sobbing)

14:49.106 --> 14:50.350
Hello?

14:50.350 --> 14:51.183
- Hello.

14:51.183 --> 14:52.016
- Nora.

14:52.016 --> 14:54.440
- Oh is this Rachel?

14:54.440 --> 14:55.273
- That's me.

14:55.273 --> 14:57.346
- Of course, hi,

14:57.346 --> 14:58.650
so still life coach?

14:58.650 --> 15:03.073
- That's right, but some
people do prefer success coach.

15:06.170 --> 15:07.003
Hello?

15:07.003 --> 15:08.100
Sarah hi.

15:08.100 --> 15:09.470
- Oh my gosh hi.

15:09.470 --> 15:10.380
- How's life?

15:10.380 --> 15:12.140
- We just got
back from our honeymoon.

15:12.140 --> 15:13.420
- Recently married?

15:13.420 --> 15:14.550
- Last month.

15:14.550 --> 15:16.154
- Great.

15:16.154 --> 15:18.250
I'm so happy for you.

15:18.250 --> 15:19.083
Hi.

15:19.083 --> 15:20.220
- Rachel (indistinct)

15:20.220 --> 15:21.710
- Oh my gosh, you still
have my number saved?

15:21.710 --> 15:24.790
- Of course,
don't be silly, what's up?

15:24.790 --> 15:29.690
- Listen, I have a new spot on my roster.

15:29.690 --> 15:31.030
- Well, Ben and I are still

15:31.030 --> 15:33.103
working out our finances.

15:39.900 --> 15:41.273
- Support group,

15:42.800 --> 15:45.097
great place to find your clientele

15:46.690 --> 15:48.707
and it's right down the street

15:51.040 --> 15:51.873
and

15:54.860 --> 15:55.967
hasn't happened yet.

15:58.944 --> 16:01.611
(gentle music)

16:36.788 --> 16:39.121
You got this, you can do it.

17:16.670 --> 17:17.920
Recommendation.

17:28.998 --> 17:29.829
- Hello?

17:29.829 --> 17:30.664
- Is this Gary?

17:30.664 --> 17:32.402
- You're the life coach right?

17:32.402 --> 17:33.233
When can I start?

17:33.233 --> 17:34.319
- I'm sorry, what?

17:34.319 --> 17:35.569
- When do I start?

17:40.190 --> 17:41.190
- You're interested.

17:42.040 --> 17:45.453
I mean, why yes of course.

17:47.304 --> 17:49.329
Let me see, I don't have many
openings for new clients,

17:49.329 --> 17:53.390
so this is an opportunity
for you and for me.

17:53.390 --> 17:54.880
- Men usually sign up too?

17:54.880 --> 17:58.113
- Yes, yes, men do bring
on life coaches too.

17:58.970 --> 18:00.973
You don't have to be nervous.

18:00.973 --> 18:02.079
- Can I have the address there,

18:02.079 --> 18:02.913
does tomorrow work?

18:02.913 --> 18:03.746
- Tomorrow.

18:03.746 --> 18:05.440
- Yeah I can come by.

18:05.440 --> 18:06.313
- In person?

18:07.339 --> 18:08.173
- Yeah.

18:08.173 --> 18:10.236
- Whatever gets you to-

18:10.236 --> 18:12.190
I mean whatever you're comfortable with.

18:12.190 --> 18:14.260
- I'm available at three.

18:14.260 --> 18:16.220
- Please, why not?

18:16.220 --> 18:17.630
- 3.00 p.m then.

18:17.630 --> 18:18.463
- All right.

18:19.590 --> 18:20.860
See you tomorrow.

18:20.860 --> 18:23.013
- Okay I gotta go.
- Bye.

18:28.910 --> 18:29.743
- In person.

18:49.271 --> 18:51.854
(gentle music)

18:59.655 --> 19:03.572
- I know, I know, good
to see you sweetie, bye.

19:08.523 --> 19:09.356
- Hello,

19:10.888 --> 19:12.180
Gary,

19:12.180 --> 19:17.047
hello, welcome.

19:17.047 --> 19:17.880
Welcome Gary.

20:02.973 --> 20:04.337
Session

20:04.337 --> 20:05.170
one

20:06.740 --> 20:08.648
Gary... Happy face.

20:11.110 --> 20:11.943
Welcome,

20:12.918 --> 20:13.835
Gary is it?

20:16.340 --> 20:21.210
Thank you for allowing me
to be your new life coach

20:21.210 --> 20:24.360
or success coach, whichever you prefer.

20:24.360 --> 20:26.210
I don't mind either.

20:26.210 --> 20:27.920
- You're my first.

20:27.920 --> 20:29.280
- Excuse me?

20:29.280 --> 20:32.373
- You said new, I've never had one before.

20:33.410 --> 20:36.120
- Oh, swell then.

20:38.700 --> 20:40.653
Today is your lucky day.

20:41.740 --> 20:44.513
Please stand with me like so,

20:48.130 --> 20:50.283
there you go, good job, brilliant.

20:56.999 --> 20:58.450
- Are you hiding from somebody too?

20:58.450 --> 20:59.283
- Sorry?

21:01.320 --> 21:03.220
Let's not change the subject now Gary.

21:06.440 --> 21:08.380
Out there is our future

21:09.510 --> 21:12.060
and the only way we can get there,

21:12.060 --> 21:14.173
is if we work together,

21:15.810 --> 21:18.633
we just have to figure out
where it is we want to go.

21:25.810 --> 21:27.683
- Middle of the fucking forest.

21:30.180 --> 21:31.393
- Why is that Gary?

21:32.652 --> 21:34.730
- I don't know, people

21:34.730 --> 21:36.800
it's too many of them.

21:36.800 --> 21:39.600
I always feel like I'm being watched.

21:39.600 --> 21:41.260
- No, no, no,

21:41.260 --> 21:42.403
no smoking in here.

21:44.320 --> 21:45.153
Sorry.

21:49.570 --> 21:50.403
That's fine.

22:00.061 --> 22:01.443
- You were recommended to me.

22:02.591 --> 22:04.154
- By whom if I may?

22:04.154 --> 22:05.093
- I feel so stupid.

22:06.281 --> 22:08.250
I just want a new life.

22:08.250 --> 22:10.130
Don't you know what that feels like?

22:12.040 --> 22:15.520
- Listen to me very closely okay?

22:15.520 --> 22:16.733
You are not alone.

22:17.720 --> 22:19.850
You are good enough.

22:19.850 --> 22:20.703
It's just,

22:21.870 --> 22:24.593
we have to figure out what
your next right move is.

22:26.500 --> 22:28.350
Now, if you wouldn't mind sitting up.

22:29.680 --> 22:30.680
- All right.

22:39.060 --> 22:42.143
We have a confidentiality
agreement thing, correct?

22:43.690 --> 22:44.523
- To an extent but-

22:44.523 --> 22:46.153
- I've stolen a lot of money.

22:47.630 --> 22:48.583
That's a lie.

22:49.460 --> 22:51.743
I made it illegally selling drugs,

22:53.290 --> 22:54.603
actually both.

22:55.930 --> 22:56.763
- Really?

22:58.090 --> 22:59.943
- I want to be a provider you see.

23:02.055 --> 23:04.155
I've had to accomplish such goals by means

23:05.492 --> 23:06.592
I'm not very proud of.

23:09.620 --> 23:13.880
- I too have done things
I'm not happy about,

23:13.880 --> 23:18.460
but it's taken me a long
time to get to where I am

23:19.750 --> 23:23.223
and I wouldn't change any
of that for the world.

23:24.510 --> 23:28.550
What we see as mistakes are just little-

23:28.550 --> 23:30.373
- 12 Weeks of sessions.

23:37.264 --> 23:38.640
- I see.

23:38.640 --> 23:40.083
- She deserves better.

23:42.970 --> 23:44.633
I don't know how to change.

23:50.890 --> 23:52.140
- Let me fix us some tea.

24:09.323 --> 24:12.470
- Rachel, thanks for the
drinks and the snacks

24:12.470 --> 24:14.063
and for your time.

24:15.040 --> 24:19.763
I feel like there's something
you're not telling me.

24:20.920 --> 24:25.633
Don't misunderstand, but
please, plainly, what can I do?

24:29.780 --> 24:33.520
- Go home, write out a
list of what you feel

24:34.447 --> 24:37.159
your flaws are, your strengths

24:37.159 --> 24:39.659
and all the reasons why
you wanna keep your woman.

24:41.710 --> 24:42.543
It's late.

24:46.860 --> 24:47.693
Thank you.

24:49.042 --> 24:50.290
We got this, don't you worry.

24:50.290 --> 24:51.490
- Please don't touch me.

24:53.240 --> 24:54.203
- So sorry.

24:55.690 --> 24:57.153
- Something smells.

25:00.250 --> 25:01.213
- Sorry again.

25:10.190 --> 25:11.380
Thanks again for coming in person,

25:11.380 --> 25:13.689
I feel adds a level of intimacy

25:13.689 --> 25:15.230
that may help us reach new heights.

25:15.230 --> 25:17.773
- Yes, 100% yes.

25:22.595 --> 25:24.550
- Well, let's start with you filling me in

25:24.550 --> 25:25.600
on how the talk went.

25:26.670 --> 25:28.903
- I don't know, it's odd.

25:29.820 --> 25:31.673
To talking it out helped a lot,

25:33.288 --> 25:36.130
you're very supportive of
me wanting more Susan time.

25:36.130 --> 25:37.203
- Beautiful.

25:38.388 --> 25:39.221
You've honored yourself.

25:39.221 --> 25:40.054
- Yes.

25:40.980 --> 25:43.003
- And how does that make you feel?

25:43.920 --> 25:46.113
- I'm over the moon.

25:47.400 --> 25:50.753
- I love the smile, but
something's missing.

25:55.513 --> 25:58.846
(gentle dramatic music)

26:14.510 --> 26:15.343
Please sit.

26:21.510 --> 26:24.223
I have just the remedy.

26:26.910 --> 26:30.130
- I didn't know you were
allowed to prescribe medication.

26:30.130 --> 26:34.560
- Well, I can prescribe you other things.

26:34.560 --> 26:38.013
You think things are good
now, I'm prescribing you this.

26:48.170 --> 26:51.040
- The next right move is sex?

26:51.040 --> 26:51.990
- Yes.

26:51.990 --> 26:55.260
- It's just, it's been a while.

26:55.260 --> 26:57.860
I never know when it's
okay to make a move,

26:57.860 --> 26:59.513
he's been so tense.

27:00.389 --> 27:02.190
- Have fun, the only thing
better than having fun,

27:02.190 --> 27:04.493
is sharing in the fun,
you know what I mean?

27:05.570 --> 27:08.170
Also remember,

27:08.170 --> 27:11.730
it's not really about the sex,

27:11.730 --> 27:14.023
it's just helping things get started.

27:15.990 --> 27:19.023
- You're right, thanks for this.

27:22.700 --> 27:23.533
- Tea?

27:25.504 --> 27:26.337
- Sure.

27:34.368 --> 27:36.201
- What's on your mind?

27:38.010 --> 27:41.690
- Feel like he has a wall
up, hardly laughs anymore

27:42.690 --> 27:45.120
and when we do talk,
it's always good news.

27:45.120 --> 27:46.597
Which is odd, right?

27:48.115 --> 27:49.198
I don't know.

27:50.117 --> 27:52.117
Whoever only has good news all the time?

27:53.150 --> 27:57.110
- Don't put it all on yourself, men,

27:57.110 --> 28:00.800
well, all people, but especially men

28:00.800 --> 28:02.580
have a harder time
breaking down those walls

28:02.580 --> 28:04.320
after they're built.

28:04.320 --> 28:06.923
- You're saying I might not break through?

28:08.220 --> 28:10.050
- All you can do is try,

28:10.050 --> 28:13.080
every time I've been stubborn
enough to keep pushing,

28:13.080 --> 28:15.530
I've always come up with
some sort of resolution.

28:18.490 --> 28:21.190
- What about the time when
you couldn't break through?

28:29.240 --> 28:32.530
- It looks like we should
get you out of here.

28:32.530 --> 28:35.063
Lots of work, I mean fun, for you to have.

28:36.070 --> 28:39.587
- I'm so sorry if I stepped
over the line, I didn't-

28:40.850 --> 28:42.833
- No, no another time maybe.

28:47.677 --> 28:49.457
Do you have your session payments?

28:51.150 --> 28:53.133
- I was gonna bring it next week.

28:54.400 --> 28:55.263
I promise.

28:58.467 --> 28:59.300
- Okay.

29:24.627 --> 29:27.460
(gentle knocking)

29:32.840 --> 29:37.640
- You and Brady or...? You
need his number don't you?

29:37.640 --> 29:39.490
Don't worry, I've got it,

29:39.490 --> 29:40.910
you know, perks of the job,

29:40.910 --> 29:42.483
but only if you want it, okay?

29:43.514 --> 29:44.353
Not gonna push anything.

29:45.360 --> 29:48.010
- No, no, I have it too.

29:48.010 --> 29:51.247
We've been talking so I
definitely made sure to get it.

29:52.083 --> 29:52.916
(exclaiming)

29:52.916 --> 29:54.291
- Look at you.

29:54.291 --> 29:55.607
(laughing)

29:55.607 --> 29:57.224
- Rooting for you,

29:57.224 --> 29:58.557
rooting for you.

30:03.454 --> 30:06.037
(gentle music)

30:07.169 --> 30:08.519
- What to buy, what to buy.

30:29.094 --> 30:32.123
(gentle knocking)

30:32.123 --> 30:34.530
- [Man] Hi, got a package.

30:34.530 --> 30:36.323
Just sign please.

31:02.324 --> 31:03.970
Alrighty.

31:03.970 --> 31:04.803
Here-

31:21.002 --> 31:22.110
Here you go.

31:22.110 --> 31:23.060
You have a nice da-

31:33.380 --> 31:36.213
(gentle knocking)

31:44.360 --> 31:45.193
- Hi there.

31:46.228 --> 31:47.061
- Hey.

31:49.650 --> 31:51.623
Forget my delivery downstairs?

31:52.590 --> 31:53.640
- Yes sorry, one sec.

31:54.895 --> 31:57.005
- I was just kidding.

31:57.005 --> 31:58.505
- Yeah, I was too.

32:00.909 --> 32:02.159
- Me too, yeah.

32:06.612 --> 32:07.445
It's hot out.

32:09.060 --> 32:09.893
Almond milk?

32:11.960 --> 32:12.793
- Water?

32:13.800 --> 32:15.473
- Yeah I have that too.

32:16.460 --> 32:18.023
- Thanks I'm parched.

32:35.270 --> 32:37.170
- Mind if I play some jams?

32:37.170 --> 32:38.003
- Sure.

32:45.713 --> 32:48.213
- I don't think I have touched
a puzzle since I was a kid.

32:49.200 --> 32:50.573
- Keeps me entertained.

32:55.851 --> 32:59.300
- It's a nice place,
less traffic out here.

32:59.300 --> 33:00.890
Quieter.

33:00.890 --> 33:02.333
- Yeah, right.

33:08.310 --> 33:09.863
- So what do you do?

33:12.249 --> 33:13.593
- I like to cook.

33:14.844 --> 33:16.033
I used to do yoga, but-

33:16.940 --> 33:17.773
- Like, for work.

33:22.356 --> 33:25.573
- I don't, currently unemployed.

33:27.080 --> 33:29.893
I have a savings though, lucky right?

33:33.260 --> 33:34.653
- What's your dream?

33:36.960 --> 33:38.080
- What's yours?

33:38.080 --> 33:39.387
- I asked you first.

33:40.419 --> 33:41.252
- Fine,

33:42.900 --> 33:44.530
traveling.

33:44.530 --> 33:45.550
- Same.

33:45.550 --> 33:47.590
Italy, France, Southeast Asia,

33:47.590 --> 33:49.800
I wanna eat my way around the world.

33:49.800 --> 33:52.003
Did you grow up here
or where are you from?

33:54.110 --> 33:55.123
- Can we just?

33:56.709 --> 33:57.542
- Yeah.

34:04.770 --> 34:07.153
What's this thing supposed
to look like anyways?

34:08.280 --> 34:09.630
- Only one way to find out.

34:11.547 --> 34:15.987
♪ There's no way I'm not a
mistake I'm a suck up to myself ♪

34:15.987 --> 34:18.187
♪ Wish I was someone else ♪

34:18.187 --> 34:21.353
♪ Face to face trying to erase ♪

34:32.831 --> 34:34.938
- No, no, no don't.

34:34.938 --> 34:37.188
(giggling)

34:40.070 --> 34:40.902
Sorry.

34:46.179 --> 34:49.469
There's no way, you have to know.

34:49.469 --> 34:51.074
- Nope.

34:51.074 --> 34:51.908
- Take a guess.

34:55.690 --> 34:56.523
- Obama.

35:01.128 --> 35:01.960
- Must be nice.

35:03.250 --> 35:05.402
And you said no dating for how long?

35:06.520 --> 35:08.362
- Almost three years.

35:09.530 --> 35:11.053
- My mind.

35:12.344 --> 35:15.340
(simulating explosion)

35:15.340 --> 35:16.190
- What's it like?

35:17.594 --> 35:18.427
- What's what like?

35:18.427 --> 35:19.260
- Being normal?

35:21.850 --> 35:24.080
- What's normal anyway?

35:24.080 --> 35:26.219
I mean like I hate when people pretend

35:26.219 --> 35:28.123
like weird is a bad thing.

35:29.186 --> 35:30.580
Normal people are just
pushing down their weird,

35:30.580 --> 35:34.123
which is blah you know?

35:37.040 --> 35:39.020
- You know, some people
are just more broken,

35:39.020 --> 35:41.072
I believe, you can tell.

35:42.996 --> 35:45.610
- And how you're not eating
all that delicious food?

35:45.610 --> 35:46.443
- See?

35:47.340 --> 35:48.303
It's so apparent.

35:57.389 --> 35:58.553
And that's cheating.

36:06.520 --> 36:07.850
- Think I'm gonna do it.

36:07.850 --> 36:09.030
- Do what?

36:09.030 --> 36:10.360
- Start a business.

36:11.558 --> 36:13.208
I don't know, maybe too daunting.

36:14.060 --> 36:14.893
- For you?

36:16.029 --> 36:17.770
- Don't think so?

36:17.770 --> 36:19.210
- Once people know you exist,

36:19.210 --> 36:21.699
they won't be able to help themselves.

36:21.699 --> 36:23.230
Just do it.

36:23.230 --> 36:24.670
Go for it.

36:24.670 --> 36:27.370
As much as I enjoy you
bringing me gifts all the time.

36:29.179 --> 36:30.033
- Personal chef.

36:30.900 --> 36:33.163
- Oh my God, yes.

36:34.382 --> 36:35.560
You're a terrific cook.

36:35.560 --> 36:39.373
- I did study at the CIA
of New York so, yeah.

36:40.812 --> 36:42.229
- Give that back.

36:54.710 --> 36:55.543
Delicious.

36:56.713 --> 36:58.713
- That's what I thought.

37:02.051 --> 37:04.884
(gentle knocking)

37:22.477 --> 37:25.644
You're not reading the book I got you.

37:29.240 --> 37:30.423
- Title was the point I thought.

37:31.634 --> 37:34.053
- But, yes and no.

37:36.500 --> 37:38.890
- I have to finish this one first.

37:38.890 --> 37:42.113
Promised myself, it's a thing I'm trying.

37:43.740 --> 37:44.583
Slow reader.

37:49.480 --> 37:52.373
But I can read yours first.

37:53.377 --> 37:55.433
- Well I appreciate your dedication.

37:57.540 --> 38:00.017
I mean, I did read it and I
wanna talk to you about it,

38:00.017 --> 38:02.763
so if you could read at
some point, be great.

38:04.779 --> 38:05.612
- Are you sure?

38:05.612 --> 38:07.180
- I'm sure.

38:07.180 --> 38:10.743
I mean, I'm not happy about it,

38:12.157 --> 38:13.324
but it's fine.

38:16.841 --> 38:17.964
- Well thank you.

38:17.964 --> 38:19.381
- You're welcome.

38:33.360 --> 38:34.460
- Again tomorrow yeah?

38:35.490 --> 38:38.150
- Yeah, tomorrow's great.

38:38.150 --> 38:39.253
Pretty sure I'm free.

38:53.210 --> 38:54.043
I,

38:58.010 --> 38:59.003
drive safe okay?

39:03.532 --> 39:06.199
- Let me take you out next time.

39:08.780 --> 39:10.870
- My place is just so comfy.

39:10.870 --> 39:13.203
- My treat, anywhere you like,

39:15.020 --> 39:17.820
seriously, where's your
favorite place to eat?

39:17.820 --> 39:19.583
I'm sure we can make it happen.

39:21.150 --> 39:23.533
- Let me think on it and
let you know tomorrow.

39:24.900 --> 39:25.733
- Works for me.

39:48.727 --> 39:51.310
(gentle music)

42:31.440 --> 42:33.540
- Please excuse my dogs, they're friendly.

42:35.343 --> 42:36.176
You okay?

42:38.519 --> 42:39.352
Come on.

42:40.948 --> 42:43.448
(tense music)

43:15.981 --> 43:18.148
(sobbing)

43:20.438 --> 43:21.488
- She said one thing,

43:22.947 --> 43:24.797
I think we're gonna be great friends.

43:26.710 --> 43:28.053
- You're serious?

43:29.180 --> 43:34.180
- Yeah, I mean we've exchanged
multiple text messages

43:34.580 --> 43:37.513
over the course of the last 24 hours.

43:38.726 --> 43:40.770
(Gary giggling)

43:40.770 --> 43:43.800
What I'm trying to say Gary is,

43:43.800 --> 43:45.710
that's how I feel about this.

43:45.710 --> 43:49.720
- Yeah, I'm not looking
for any new friends.

43:49.720 --> 43:51.773
- But you have listed here that's why-

43:53.065 --> 43:53.898
- I've changed my mind.

43:53.898 --> 43:55.554
- Look we cant' just-

43:55.554 --> 43:57.429
- You know what, it's
quite clear that you-

43:57.429 --> 43:58.453
- Gary it's just-

43:58.453 --> 43:59.286
- You don't have any experiences

43:59.286 --> 44:01.110
and you don't know me.

44:01.110 --> 44:02.186
- Then why are you here?

44:02.186 --> 44:03.390
- What?

44:03.390 --> 44:05.270
- Why are you here?

44:05.270 --> 44:06.483
- For my wife.

44:07.580 --> 44:09.803
- How do you feel about her?

44:11.300 --> 44:12.133
- Love her.

44:14.860 --> 44:15.933
Love my wife.

44:18.830 --> 44:22.660
- Good, now if we can just use that

44:22.660 --> 44:23.740
as a starting point.

44:23.740 --> 44:25.960
- Let's do this, swap me out,

44:25.960 --> 44:28.580
put me under, whatever
it is you do, I'm ready.

44:28.580 --> 44:30.030
- Gary.

44:30.030 --> 44:32.380
- Yeah I've thought about
this don't you worry.

44:34.286 --> 44:35.119
It's okay.

44:35.119 --> 44:38.593
- We're here to make your life,
the one worth living Gary.

44:40.110 --> 44:41.733
Not to change who you are.

44:43.174 --> 44:44.674
- I don't wanna be me anymore.

44:47.773 --> 44:50.840
I can never be what I
need to be for my lady.

44:50.840 --> 44:51.823
I've tried.

44:54.260 --> 44:55.633
- What have you tried?

44:57.310 --> 45:00.810
Step one is love yourself.

45:00.810 --> 45:03.193
If you love you, then she will too.

45:05.110 --> 45:06.460
Do you wanna stay with her?

45:07.590 --> 45:09.610
- More than anything else.

45:09.610 --> 45:11.293
- Then talk to her.

45:12.630 --> 45:14.430
Share your feelings.

45:14.430 --> 45:19.007
You can't expect anyone
to be a mind reader.

45:41.740 --> 45:43.493
- Sharing is caring?

45:46.190 --> 45:47.023
- It is.

45:55.981 --> 45:56.220
(gentle knocking)

45:58.220 --> 45:59.240
- Should I get it?

45:59.240 --> 46:01.213
- No, no, no I..

46:01.590 --> 46:02.520
Thanks come in.

46:09.937 --> 46:12.187
- I was just on my way out.

46:19.600 --> 46:21.663
Sorry to take up so much of your time.

46:22.650 --> 46:25.780
Don't you worry, I'll
have those weeds pulled

46:25.780 --> 46:29.063
and my motivations
reexamined by next week.

46:30.770 --> 46:33.770
Gary, the gardener,

46:33.770 --> 46:37.670
- Brady, the boyfriend?

46:37.670 --> 46:38.970
- You two have a good day.

46:52.440 --> 46:53.863
- Held onto it all day.

46:55.820 --> 46:56.653
- Thank you.

47:01.250 --> 47:02.803
- So he's not your gardener,

47:04.710 --> 47:06.893
he's not a lover.

47:08.510 --> 47:09.940
- Look-
- Wait,

47:09.940 --> 47:10.943
I wanna guess.

47:12.800 --> 47:17.553
You look terrific, you've
kept the lighting moody,

47:19.297 --> 47:20.597
the air's a little stuffy.

47:21.925 --> 47:22.800
(clicking fingers)

47:22.800 --> 47:24.810
He's a private investigator.

47:24.810 --> 47:28.000
You hired to track down
a previous ex for a car

47:28.000 --> 47:29.983
they stole in the breakup.

47:31.910 --> 47:34.930
- Sorry about that, he
was a client of mine.

47:34.930 --> 47:39.100
- Last I asked, you said you didn't work.

47:39.100 --> 47:40.100
- Boyfriend?

47:40.100 --> 47:42.975
You told him you were my-

47:42.975 --> 47:43.808
- I did not say I was your boyfriend.

47:43.808 --> 47:45.300
- Yeah, you did.

47:45.300 --> 47:48.240
You meet this guy for the first time

47:48.240 --> 47:52.030
and you introduced yourself
to him as my boyfriend.

47:52.030 --> 47:54.350
I mean like we've never
even talked about it.

47:54.350 --> 47:56.430
- I asked in sort of a cute
way, it doesn't matter.

47:56.430 --> 47:59.670
What matters is, I need
to know who that was

47:59.670 --> 48:00.890
and what you do for work.

48:00.890 --> 48:02.013
- Life coach.

48:07.960 --> 48:09.133
I'm a life coach.

48:12.400 --> 48:13.233
Behold.

48:15.660 --> 48:16.553
- Spicy.

48:25.620 --> 48:27.570
How do I know you're telling the truth?

48:29.160 --> 48:30.840
What's in the box?

48:30.840 --> 48:33.340
- It's just my refills on
shampoo and conditioner.

48:35.690 --> 48:36.523
Fine, look.

48:40.530 --> 48:41.680
- Off the hook for now.

48:43.959 --> 48:45.498
That guy did scare me though.

48:45.498 --> 48:46.331
- Yeah.

48:48.400 --> 48:49.750
So what are we doing today?

48:51.260 --> 48:52.660
- I don't know, you tell me.

48:53.960 --> 48:55.693
- How adventurous are you feeling?

48:57.280 --> 48:58.913
- A library sounds fun.

49:00.920 --> 49:05.300
- Well, in that case, it's no library.

49:05.300 --> 49:06.133
- Almond milk?

49:07.834 --> 49:10.509
- Close second though, I've
got a friend who's hosting

49:10.509 --> 49:11.940
this cool hangout thing,
I know it's gonna be fun,

49:11.940 --> 49:13.953
love for you being a plus one if you,

49:15.200 --> 49:16.333
feel free to say no.

49:17.500 --> 49:18.773
- I want to,

49:21.140 --> 49:24.203
but you're gonna judge me.

49:26.890 --> 49:27.723
- No,

49:30.260 --> 49:31.093
try me.

49:31.568 --> 49:32.946
People…

49:33.306 --> 49:35.306
- People, don't like me.

49:36.698 --> 49:40.281
(gentle melancholic music)

49:49.030 --> 49:51.470
- So you don't leave your apartment?

49:51.470 --> 49:52.810
- See if you're gonna judge me,

49:52.810 --> 49:54.083
they're gonna judge me.

49:55.130 --> 49:58.343
- I mean, it doesn't mean
there's anything wrong with you.

49:59.626 --> 50:01.143
- Look, I want to go.

50:02.420 --> 50:06.073
- If you wanna go, let's give it a shot.

50:07.540 --> 50:10.010
They're all super friendly.

50:10.010 --> 50:11.113
They'll love you.

50:13.210 --> 50:14.043
Shall we?

50:20.670 --> 50:21.952
- Okay.

50:48.330 --> 50:50.400
- Made it, how you feeling?

50:52.140 --> 50:54.021
- Feeling great.

50:54.430 --> 50:55.701
Yeah.

50:58.210 --> 50:59.043
Shall we?

51:25.210 --> 51:26.861
(chattering)

51:26.861 --> 51:28.961
- Brady, my dude.

51:28.961 --> 51:30.321
- My man.

51:30.321 --> 51:31.154
- Buddy.

51:31.154 --> 51:32.747
- Happy to see you.

51:32.747 --> 51:33.580
- You too.

51:33.580 --> 51:34.481
- I'm Amy.

51:34.481 --> 51:35.314
- Hi.

51:36.521 --> 51:39.198
- Looks like you guys lost
some weight, congrats.

51:40.739 --> 51:42.191
- Keto.
- Keto.

51:42.191 --> 51:43.841
- Thanks for calling it out, jerk.

51:45.031 --> 51:45.881
- This is Rachel.

51:47.171 --> 51:48.704
- I'm Nolan.

51:54.011 --> 51:56.181
Okay, you guys want some drinks or?

51:56.181 --> 51:58.784
- Designated driver, so just a water.

52:00.761 --> 52:02.344
- You want a drink?

52:05.451 --> 52:07.059
Cool.

52:07.059 --> 52:08.719
- Please make yourselves at home.

52:08.719 --> 52:10.136
- Yeah all right.

52:46.413 --> 52:49.330
(breathing deeply)

52:57.091 --> 52:58.621
- Come join the conversation?

52:58.621 --> 52:59.934
Talk about life goals.

53:00.941 --> 53:02.191
- People talk about that?

53:03.141 --> 53:04.754
- No, they don't.

53:06.141 --> 53:08.331
We're actually talking
about the generational gap

53:08.331 --> 53:10.381
and how millennials
will likely be the ones

53:10.381 --> 53:11.931
to step up and save the planet.

53:13.481 --> 53:14.531
Kidding again, sorry.

53:15.941 --> 53:17.191
We're just grilling Demi.

53:18.881 --> 53:20.454
- Make this easy on me please.

53:21.561 --> 53:24.171
- Of course, what are you thinking?

53:24.171 --> 53:25.344
We can leave or,

53:33.735 --> 53:34.568
shall we?

53:39.266 --> 53:42.091
- I don't know, I handled
it like anything else,

53:42.091 --> 53:44.501
I was down, but you know what?

53:44.501 --> 53:47.131
I picked myself up by my bootstraps.

53:47.131 --> 53:48.171
- Right, right.

53:48.171 --> 53:49.914
- Wait so no second date?

53:51.364 --> 53:52.716
- Well, I don't know,

53:52.716 --> 53:56.151
but, well I do know it's
not that interesting.

53:56.151 --> 53:57.524
- She loves to hype.

53:58.460 --> 54:00.162
- Fine, I'll tell you.

54:00.162 --> 54:00.995
- [Brady] No, you won't.

54:00.995 --> 54:02.624
- Yes I will, watch me.

54:02.624 --> 54:03.676
- No, you won't.

54:03.676 --> 54:04.509
- I'm watching.

54:04.509 --> 54:05.342
- She didn't like it when I mentioned,

54:05.342 --> 54:07.884
that I liked to sit in what
we call the power seat.

54:09.187 --> 54:10.504
- What "we" call the ?

54:10.504 --> 54:13.101
- We don't call
- No, I don't think,

54:13.101 --> 54:15.561
- that's ever been a thing.
- Maybe kind of a new thing.

54:15.561 --> 54:17.059
- Yeah.

54:17.059 --> 54:18.651
- That isn't a thing is it?

54:18.651 --> 54:19.873
- No.

54:19.873 --> 54:21.841
- Yeah, you got it, you totally get it.

54:21.841 --> 54:24.521
Who cares, if I like to sit in the middle

54:24.521 --> 54:26.741
of the establishment and see the entrance

54:26.741 --> 54:28.854
and exit of the place, come on,

54:29.731 --> 54:32.621
don't act like you don't do this.

54:32.621 --> 54:34.151
- Are you sure it was even a date?

54:34.151 --> 54:35.401
- Well, it sounds like a date.

54:35.401 --> 54:37.164
- It doesn't sound like a date.

54:37.164 --> 54:38.079
- It doesn't sound like a date,

54:38.079 --> 54:38.972
it sounds like a seating arrangement.

54:38.972 --> 54:39.922
- Rachel any ideas?

54:42.341 --> 54:44.384
She's a life coach of sorts.

54:45.899 --> 54:47.621
Go ahead, she won't take offense.

54:47.621 --> 54:49.331
- Jeez thanks.

54:49.331 --> 54:50.934
So a life coach, huh?

54:52.021 --> 54:54.061
- I would never have even guessed that.

54:54.061 --> 54:57.161
I would have said maybe
school teacher or nurse even.

54:57.161 --> 54:59.041
- Oh yeah, or like a receptionist.

54:59.041 --> 55:00.091
- Librarian.

55:00.091 --> 55:01.131
- Cleaning technician.

55:01.131 --> 55:02.791
- Yeah or a school teacher.

55:02.791 --> 55:04.251
- No, I said school teacher.

55:04.251 --> 55:05.084
- Oh yeah.

55:05.084 --> 55:06.640
- Restroom?

55:06.640 --> 55:08.057
- Oh yeah, it's..

55:23.696 --> 55:26.196
(guy purging)

55:35.020 --> 55:36.529
(gentle knocking)

55:36.529 --> 55:37.664
- Rachel, you in there?

55:38.999 --> 55:41.581
Did you see a girl in a
denim jacket go in there?

55:41.581 --> 55:42.414
Okay.

55:46.281 --> 55:47.581
You guys see Rachel leave?

55:50.021 --> 55:52.414
- She didn't pass
out in our bedroom did she?

55:53.496 --> 55:54.669
- Think I offended her

55:54.669 --> 55:55.502
with that whole school teacher thing?

55:58.024 --> 55:59.698
Smells like throw up everywhere over here.

56:09.312 --> 56:11.411
- You don't have to do this.

56:11.411 --> 56:12.244
- But I want to.

56:31.811 --> 56:32.894
You're so strong.

56:34.385 --> 56:35.916
- What?

56:35.916 --> 56:37.333
- Think about it.

56:38.295 --> 56:39.128
Look where you are.

56:40.551 --> 56:44.361
Out of your apartment all
the way across the city even,

56:44.361 --> 56:46.431
when's the last time
you've been out like this?

56:46.431 --> 56:48.021
- It's all new.

56:48.021 --> 56:49.271
- Even more amazing then.

56:50.591 --> 56:52.404
I'm surprised you trusted me, honestly.

56:54.302 --> 56:55.652
- You make it look so easy.

56:56.711 --> 56:57.661
- It's all a cover.

56:58.501 --> 57:00.701
Took a lot of work to make this look like

57:00.701 --> 57:02.641
I got my shit together.

57:02.641 --> 57:04.151
Seriously.

57:04.151 --> 57:06.241
I have to go to Johnny's
at least twice a week

57:06.241 --> 57:08.411
to get a bagel sandwich
and a chocolate cupcake

57:08.411 --> 57:09.904
just to maintain my sanity.

57:10.921 --> 57:11.754
It's true.

57:17.357 --> 57:18.190
- I..

57:20.935 --> 57:21.768
- What?

57:23.231 --> 57:25.334
- I don't know, it's just,

57:27.361 --> 57:29.464
I think too much, it's stupid.

57:32.821 --> 57:34.400
You see,

57:34.825 --> 57:37.719
my dad was never a good listener,

57:38.210 --> 57:40.390
growing up we'd always argue,

57:40.870 --> 57:43.940
I felt the need to stand up to him,

57:44.931 --> 57:47.671
but this one time when we were driving,

57:47.671 --> 57:49.054
just the two of us,

57:50.371 --> 57:51.654
we got into it bad,

57:54.261 --> 57:57.574
I couldn't take it anymore,
so I told him to pull over.

58:02.418 --> 58:03.834
I got out and he left.

58:04.971 --> 58:07.121
I realized I left my
cell phone in the car.

58:10.272 --> 58:13.111
Sorry, you don't wanna hear this.

58:13.111 --> 58:14.111
- It's fine.

58:16.301 --> 58:17.714
- It's also,

58:20.976 --> 58:22.724
I panicked.

58:25.072 --> 58:26.254
I felt like I was gonna die.

58:27.151 --> 58:29.244
My heart hurt and that was it.

58:30.461 --> 58:35.224
There was just all these
people looking at me,

58:36.751 --> 58:40.384
some were laughing, some looked disgusted.

58:44.806 --> 58:45.811
- That's..

58:45.811 --> 58:48.314
- I ran as fast as I could,

58:49.491 --> 58:51.014
hoping he'd still be there,

58:53.191 --> 58:54.024
he was,

58:57.271 --> 58:59.774
I got there just in time to see,

59:05.700 --> 59:07.810
to see him get hit.

59:11.832 --> 59:14.121
I'm sure he took one look
at me and saw how broken.

59:14.121 --> 59:18.350
- Stop that is not fair.

59:19.661 --> 59:21.750
- So you did think that?

59:21.930 --> 59:23.461
- I didn't say that.

59:23.461 --> 59:25.340
You're a good person.

59:26.340 --> 59:29.480
That's what I saw and I liked it.

59:33.259 --> 59:34.937
- Thank you.

59:34.937 --> 59:36.391
- For what?

59:36.391 --> 59:37.504
- For listening to me.

59:42.970 --> 59:44.999
- I think the coast is clear,

59:44.999 --> 59:46.996
ready to break out of here?

59:46.996 --> 59:48.746
Let's do it, come on.

59:54.960 --> 59:57.210
- Now I really have to pee.

1:00:46.230 --> 1:00:47.790
Thanks for everything.

1:00:48.220 --> 1:00:49.630
- Anytime.

1:00:53.010 --> 1:00:54.340
- Thanks again.

1:00:54.840 --> 1:00:56.280
- No problem,

1:00:56.810 --> 1:00:59.230
- so yes…
- I wanna say something.

1:00:59.570 --> 1:01:00.736
- OK.

1:01:10.204 --> 1:01:11.287
- I like you.

1:01:12.631 --> 1:01:14.048
- I like you too.

1:01:15.480 --> 1:01:16.626
- I want..

1:01:22.520 --> 1:01:24.000
I think,

1:01:27.078 --> 1:01:28.495
I don't know, I..

1:01:29.347 --> 1:01:32.030
- I think you did really well back there.

1:01:32.690 --> 1:01:35.777
Next time we'll do something more low-key.

1:01:35.777 --> 1:01:36.728
- What?

1:01:36.728 --> 1:01:37.701
- Just the two of us, there's no pressure.

1:01:37.701 --> 1:01:39.430
- Next time?

1:01:40.461 --> 1:01:41.294
- Yeah.

1:01:48.920 --> 1:01:50.830
- I just need to be alone.

1:01:52.000 --> 1:01:53.046
Thanks.

1:02:46.730 --> 1:02:49.397
(running water)

1:03:08.435 --> 1:03:11.268
(gentle knocking)

1:03:17.514 --> 1:03:19.215
(gentle knocking)

1:03:40.950 --> 1:03:44.268
(gentle knocking)

1:03:47.001 --> 1:03:50.788
(gentle knocking)

1:03:57.680 --> 1:03:58.713
Oh,

1:03:59.316 --> 1:04:00.501
hey.

1:04:01.365 --> 1:04:02.198
- Hey.

1:04:33.431 --> 1:04:36.664
- I've been logging it
all, so much progress.

1:04:37.521 --> 1:04:38.424
You know why?

1:04:41.115 --> 1:04:45.240
- Were you let down and
left with a bunch of time?

1:04:45.240 --> 1:04:49.311
- No, I know the truth, I've
allowed myself to be inspired.

1:04:49.311 --> 1:04:52.344
I've given myself permission
to connect with what drives me.

1:04:53.722 --> 1:04:55.571
I've grown to love myself.

1:04:55.571 --> 1:04:58.411
- Great, go on.

1:04:58.411 --> 1:05:00.051
- It's been amazing.

1:05:00.051 --> 1:05:04.921
Let's see, we've had
sex at least once a day

1:05:04.921 --> 1:05:06.711
since you prescribed it.

1:05:06.711 --> 1:05:10.580
And he's been so open
with my me time as well.

1:05:11.260 --> 1:05:13.660
I started four new books this week

1:05:14.120 --> 1:05:17.040
and next step is Hawaii.

1:05:17.170 --> 1:05:18.240
- No.

1:05:19.810 --> 1:05:23.100
- Rachel?

1:05:23.420 --> 1:05:24.741
Rachel, you don't look at me.

1:05:25.200 --> 1:05:26.720
Head up.

1:05:27.980 --> 1:05:29.440
What's gotten into you?

1:05:32.800 --> 1:05:36.333
Girl, that move got me
out of sharing with you.

1:05:38.060 --> 1:05:38.893
- It's,

1:05:40.790 --> 1:05:41.623
it's nothing.

1:05:43.050 --> 1:05:45.200
- I don't wanna have to
twist your arm here.

1:05:46.540 --> 1:05:49.280
- I'm already in enough pain.

1:05:49.280 --> 1:05:51.930
- Oh, I was only poking fun,
it's just an expression.

1:05:55.040 --> 1:05:56.693
- I'm not good at jokes,

1:05:57.718 --> 1:06:00.385
I don't do anything well really.

1:06:00.970 --> 1:06:05.540
I don't know how to meet
people, I never travel,

1:06:05.660 --> 1:06:07.500
I never know how to make friends.

1:06:07.580 --> 1:06:09.030
- Stop.

1:06:09.635 --> 1:06:10.760
This isn't helping you,

1:06:10.770 --> 1:06:12.493
there's nothing wrong with you.

1:06:14.120 --> 1:06:16.860
Remember what you tell me all the time?

1:06:16.860 --> 1:06:18.350
- What?

1:06:18.350 --> 1:06:19.183
Matter?

1:06:20.410 --> 1:06:23.010
You're really pulling
that on me right now?

1:06:23.010 --> 1:06:24.360
- Rachel I..

1:06:24.360 --> 1:06:26.330
- You think I leave this place?

1:06:26.530 --> 1:06:30.110
This week is the first time
I left my apartment in years

1:06:30.110 --> 1:06:32.350
and I want to be of value to people,

1:06:32.350 --> 1:06:36.580
but I don't have what
it takes to be anything.

1:06:38.840 --> 1:06:40.143
- You have me.

1:06:41.040 --> 1:06:43.303
We're friends, we'll always be friends.

1:06:45.460 --> 1:06:46.293
- I'm sorry.

1:06:47.150 --> 1:06:47.983
- Why?

1:06:50.460 --> 1:06:52.810
- I'm supposed to be the strong one.

1:06:52.810 --> 1:06:54.190
- Please.

1:06:54.190 --> 1:06:56.553
There's no reason why we can't trade off.

1:06:57.500 --> 1:06:58.423
Let me help you.

1:07:00.570 --> 1:07:02.160
If you're up for it,

1:07:02.160 --> 1:07:04.160
join me and my hubby for dinner tonight.

1:07:18.180 --> 1:07:19.013
- Let's do it.

1:07:21.390 --> 1:07:25.020
- Wow, okay then.

1:07:26.208 --> 1:07:27.376
- I’ll…

1:07:27.510 --> 1:07:31.400
I'll just come back and pick
you up in a few hours then?

1:07:31.400 --> 1:07:32.233
- Perfect.

1:07:39.170 --> 1:07:40.620
- Four thirty?

1:07:40.840 --> 1:07:41.510
- Yeah.

1:07:41.710 --> 1:07:43.092
- Okay.

1:07:48.710 --> 1:07:49.543
Be ready?

Rachel!

1:11:33.620 --> 1:11:34.920
Rachel!!

1:11:37.212 --> 1:11:39.680
Oh Rachel, are you okay?

1:11:39.950 --> 1:11:41.460
- Maria?
- Yeah.

1:11:45.529 --> 1:11:46.362
You okay?

1:11:47.955 --> 1:11:49.728
Sweetie, the windows were open,

1:11:49.728 --> 1:11:52.991
I saw you laying here
I had to come in okay?

1:11:52.991 --> 1:11:54.599
- No, yeah.

1:11:54.599 --> 1:11:57.081
- I know how you can, you know?

1:11:57.081 --> 1:11:57.916
- Thank you.

1:11:57.916 --> 1:11:58.750
- You're welcome.

1:11:58.750 --> 1:12:00.349
- But please.

1:12:00.349 --> 1:12:01.910
- Sorry.

1:12:01.910 --> 1:12:02.889
But I know how you can-

1:12:02.889 --> 1:12:04.344
- Yes.

1:12:04.344 --> 1:12:05.179
- Okay.

1:12:05.179 --> 1:12:06.010
- Yes, I'm working on it.

1:12:06.010 --> 1:12:07.264
- I know.

1:12:07.264 --> 1:12:08.096
- I was just taking a nap.

1:12:08.096 --> 1:12:08.929
- Okay.

1:12:09.649 --> 1:12:11.032
'Cause remember the laundry room?

1:12:11.032 --> 1:12:12.621
- Maria, I'm okay.
- Okay.

1:12:13.736 --> 1:12:15.035
- I'm just tired.
- Okay.

1:12:16.809 --> 1:12:18.054
Promise?

1:12:18.054 --> 1:12:19.483
- Promise.

1:12:19.483 --> 1:12:20.317
- Okay.

1:12:24.479 --> 1:12:26.005
Okay.

1:12:32.050 --> 1:12:32.884
How do you feel?

1:12:34.490 --> 1:12:36.934
- I'm okay.
- Yeah?

1:12:36.934 --> 1:12:38.102
- Yeah.
- Okay.

1:12:42.679 --> 1:12:44.108
- Ready spaghetti?

1:12:44.108 --> 1:12:46.460
- Sorry in the middle of getting ready.

1:12:46.460 --> 1:12:48.411
- Say no more, take your time.

1:12:49.438 --> 1:12:53.094
Oh, sorry, Susan this is Maria.

1:12:56.870 --> 1:12:58.813
- Neighbor.
- Hi.

1:12:59.938 --> 1:13:01.741
- Sweetie I'm gonna get on my way,

1:13:01.741 --> 1:13:04.960
okay but you need to
get some rest, please,

1:13:04.960 --> 1:13:05.791
okay?

1:13:07.029 --> 1:13:08.420
- Okay.

1:13:11.819 --> 1:13:15.608
Just one sec.

1:13:16.529 --> 1:13:19.113
(gentle music)

1:13:45.211 --> 1:13:47.718
- Hey what are you doing out there?

1:13:47.718 --> 1:13:49.618
I don't want you burning up, come on.

1:14:11.920 --> 1:14:13.460
Make yourself at home.

1:14:13.550 --> 1:14:15.212
- Thank you.

1:14:34.140 --> 1:14:36.471
- I'm so glad you could make it,

1:14:36.471 --> 1:14:38.621
heard you been having
a rough time as well.

1:14:39.911 --> 1:14:40.744
Chocolate?

1:14:43.991 --> 1:14:48.040
No, don't want to ruin
that appetite right? (chuckling)

1:14:48.130 --> 1:14:50.610
Please come in, have a seat.

1:15:01.501 --> 1:15:02.334
- Thirsty?

1:15:03.901 --> 1:15:06.801
We have some chardonnay some Cab, Merlot.

1:15:06.801 --> 1:15:09.101
Even some tequila if
you're feeling up for it.

1:15:12.231 --> 1:15:13.831
- Almond milk?

1:15:13.831 --> 1:15:14.954
- Coming right up.

1:15:36.891 --> 1:15:37.724
- I'm starving.

1:15:38.550 --> 1:15:41.881
- It's kind of a community,
serve yourself type of thing,

1:15:41.881 --> 1:15:43.390
so feel free.

1:16:04.880 --> 1:16:06.760
- So…

1:16:07.355 --> 1:16:10.236
You mentioned that you
don't leave your apartment?

1:16:10.351 --> 1:16:11.781
- Susan.

1:16:11.781 --> 1:16:12.744
- Let her respond.

1:16:14.001 --> 1:16:15.001
- I'm working on it.

1:16:16.611 --> 1:16:19.180
- With the help of a Brady?

1:16:22.071 --> 1:16:26.601
- I don't really know if
he's helping or hurting.

1:16:26.601 --> 1:16:27.551
- What do you mean?

1:16:28.600 --> 1:16:31.160
- I like this guy, but…

1:16:32.688 --> 1:16:34.975
It's not even about that.

1:16:35.161 --> 1:16:37.471
- See, it's not even about that.

1:16:37.471 --> 1:16:38.754
- Heard her dear.

1:16:40.181 --> 1:16:43.921
- It might be quite odd that Susan and I

1:16:43.921 --> 1:16:46.331
were both your clients.

1:16:46.331 --> 1:16:47.831
- Sorry to keep that from you.

1:16:48.941 --> 1:16:51.560
- Yeah, no, I'm sorry.

1:16:52.760 --> 1:16:55.080
It is a little weird though.

1:16:56.791 --> 1:16:59.370
You two seem so happy.

1:17:03.731 --> 1:17:04.564
- Thanks to you.

1:17:05.991 --> 1:17:09.951
- Like, I've been seeing
both sides of this

1:17:09.951 --> 1:17:13.184
and offering my advice,

1:17:14.241 --> 1:17:19.100
so like it's been good,

1:17:19.391 --> 1:17:22.420
it's all working.

1:17:24.011 --> 1:17:27.021
- Yeah, the open communication,

1:17:27.021 --> 1:17:29.024
the sharing of feelings.

1:17:34.001 --> 1:17:36.324
- But how,

1:17:37.171 --> 1:17:42.131
how can you both know everything you know,

1:17:42.131 --> 1:17:44.321
and still be able to offer yourselves

1:17:44.321 --> 1:17:45.621
fully in the relationship?

1:17:46.580 --> 1:17:48.103
- Listen, Rachel,

1:17:49.031 --> 1:17:50.274
how do I put this?

1:17:52.391 --> 1:17:54.754
We both work really hard at this.

1:17:56.151 --> 1:17:59.400
- Something was a bit off for a while, but

1:17:59.763 --> 1:18:02.361
you helped us get back on track,

1:18:02.361 --> 1:18:04.044
as individuals and as a couple.

1:18:05.011 --> 1:18:05.844
- I don't know.

1:18:06.801 --> 1:18:09.321
It's nice knowing
whether we say it or not,

1:18:09.321 --> 1:18:13.794
that our feelings are
there for each other.

1:18:15.651 --> 1:18:17.321
I know I love Susan too much

1:18:17.321 --> 1:18:19.381
to let the little things get in the way.

1:18:21.112 --> 1:18:22.633
- Dork.

1:18:22.633 --> 1:18:24.966
(chuckling)

1:18:30.300 --> 1:18:31.919
- Cheers.

1:18:34.020 --> 1:18:36.685
- To progress.

1:18:36.685 --> 1:18:39.602
(glasses clinking)

1:18:48.770 --> 1:18:51.870
- I don't usually like
sweets, but this is good.

1:18:52.760 --> 1:18:54.603
Oh my gosh, I'm so full.

1:18:56.781 --> 1:18:58.711
- Sure you don't want a
slice to take with you?

1:18:58.711 --> 1:19:00.201
- No, no, no.

1:19:00.201 --> 1:19:01.051
Thank you though.

1:19:01.991 --> 1:19:04.110
- Thank you for coming.

1:19:07.201 --> 1:19:09.954
- Yeah, it was great to have you,

1:19:11.601 --> 1:19:13.541
speaking of great to have you,

1:19:13.541 --> 1:19:15.924
look Rachel I don't know
how to say this because,

1:19:17.137 --> 1:19:19.101
- Because you haven't done anything wrong.

1:19:19.101 --> 1:19:22.068
- We're in a good place and..

1:19:23.071 --> 1:19:26.094
- And we're not going to
need your services anymore.

1:19:28.221 --> 1:19:31.191
Rachel we love you and
we wanna stay friends,

1:19:31.191 --> 1:19:32.024
it's just..

1:19:33.055 --> 1:19:33.927
- Is it,

1:19:33.927 --> 1:19:35.604
is it because you think I'm crazy now?

1:19:35.604 --> 1:19:36.437
- No.

1:19:36.437 --> 1:19:38.161
- Because of what happened earlier?

1:19:38.161 --> 1:19:39.696
- Rachel.

1:19:39.696 --> 1:19:42.551
- I share a bit of who
I am and you run off?

1:19:42.551 --> 1:19:43.891
Huh?

1:19:43.891 --> 1:19:44.724
I should have,

1:19:45.811 --> 1:19:46.681
this is,

1:19:46.681 --> 1:19:48.628
I thought this..

1:19:48.710 --> 1:19:50.270
- Rachel please.

1:19:50.530 --> 1:19:52.710
- Don't touch me.

1:19:53.020 --> 1:19:54.568
- Rachel.

1:20:28.421 --> 1:20:31.004
(gentle music)

1:21:09.370 --> 1:21:10.590
- Thanks.

1:21:11.600 --> 1:21:14.704
- Hey, keep it.

1:21:28.690 --> 1:21:31.680
(screaming)

1:21:47.030 --> 1:21:52.802
(gentle music)

1:23:01.650 --> 1:23:07.474
(gentle upbeat music)

1:25:33.290 --> 1:25:34.906
- Wow.

1:25:41.821 --> 1:25:46.071
Look at you, wow, all this way.

1:25:46.071 --> 1:25:47.764
Hashtag impressed.

1:25:49.511 --> 1:25:51.561
I'm sorry I said that,

1:25:52.706 --> 1:25:54.880
I don't normally do that.

1:25:55.030 --> 1:25:56.613
- You're not perfect.

1:25:58.550 --> 1:26:00.561
- I'm sorry..?

1:26:02.060 --> 1:26:04.951
- Meant to say, you're not perfect

1:26:05.791 --> 1:26:09.581
and neither am I and that's okay.

1:26:09.581 --> 1:26:10.694
- I'm sorry if I,

1:26:11.841 --> 1:26:13.961
I just want to make sure I
was giving you enough space

1:26:13.961 --> 1:26:15.526
because I know-

1:26:15.526 --> 1:26:19.798
- It's okay. Smart move.
I just wanted to see you.

1:26:20.490 --> 1:26:21.936
- Good.

1:26:21.936 --> 1:26:23.334
Thanks for finding-

1:26:36.180 --> 1:26:38.233
Did you want some of this?

1:26:39.951 --> 1:26:41.444
- Yeah, but just a bite.

1:26:46.041 --> 1:26:47.490
Yum thank you.

1:26:49.221 --> 1:26:50.054
- Listen,

1:26:51.391 --> 1:26:53.084
I'm sorry if,

1:26:57.611 --> 1:26:59.991
join me on the rest of my route?

1:26:59.991 --> 1:27:01.441
I only have a few stops left.

1:27:04.711 --> 1:27:06.850
