00:55.680 --> 00:57.974
["MMMBop" continues playing]

01:04.105 --> 01:06.900
[Naomi] So, now on to final business.

01:06.983 --> 01:10.028
-Anyone?
-Yeah, I actually have some news to share.

01:10.111 --> 01:13.698
Yeah, the book that Ethan Turner and I
have been working on

01:13.782 --> 01:15.158
is ready for prime time.

01:15.241 --> 01:17.577
-We just broke it wide open...
-[shouts] Wait!

01:17.660 --> 01:19.454
I am so sorry to interrupt.

01:19.537 --> 01:20.789
Good morning, Patel.

01:20.872 --> 01:22.832
I love your beret.

01:22.916 --> 01:27.212
Thanks. Anyway, I just got off the phone
with Anne Michael at Random.

01:27.295 --> 01:32.967
They are bidding mid-seven figures
for Patty Ho's<i> Wolf Trials</i> series!

01:33.051 --> 01:34.969
Oh, God, that's awesome!

01:35.053 --> 01:37.138
[all howl]

01:41.684 --> 01:43.686
I don't know what we're doing. Why--

01:43.770 --> 01:46.689
Get your hands out of my face, Patel!
Why are you howling?

01:46.773 --> 01:48.233
That's my book,<i> Wolf Trials.</i>

01:48.316 --> 01:51.111
The book Ethan Turner and I
were working on,<i> Wolf Trials.</i>

01:51.194 --> 01:52.987
What are you talking about?

01:53.530 --> 01:57.826
<i>Wolf Trials!</i> I was gonna just announce it
right now to all you guys!

01:58.409 --> 02:00.620
-Are you joking?
-No, I'm not joking!

02:00.703 --> 02:01.704
Are you joking?

02:01.788 --> 02:03.665
Are you joking? I'm not joking.

02:03.748 --> 02:07.877
Max,<i> Wolf Trials</i> has been in the works
for at least a year.

02:08.837 --> 02:09.963
That...

02:12.257 --> 02:13.508
I got it.

02:14.384 --> 02:17.262
I'm getting punked.
You guys are punking me.

02:17.345 --> 02:19.305
No one's punking anyone.

02:19.389 --> 02:21.891
I mean, we discuss it
at every single meeting.

02:21.975 --> 02:24.185
You even contributed some ideas.

02:27.897 --> 02:30.942
["MMMBop" playing slow and distorted]

02:44.914 --> 02:49.794
No one has ever thought
to put a wolf on trial.

02:49.878 --> 02:52.130
[Naomi] And what do you think, Max?

02:52.213 --> 02:55.633
I think it should end with a...
with a big courtroom scene.

03:14.402 --> 03:17.739
I think you might be a little distracted
on the personal front.

03:18.531 --> 03:20.116
I punked you guys.

03:21.284 --> 03:22.577
I punked you, that was a...

03:23.828 --> 03:25.705
the reverse punk, so...

03:26.331 --> 03:28.041
I pulled a switch on you.

03:29.667 --> 03:31.002
I reversed it.

03:33.254 --> 03:35.173
[soft rock song playing]

03:43.806 --> 03:44.974
[sighs]

03:45.475 --> 03:48.061
A lot of people
find their 40th birthdays challenging.

03:48.645 --> 03:52.398
-Please don't try to make this about that.
-What do you think it's about?

03:52.482 --> 03:54.817
Why don't you tell me?
You're the professional.

03:55.652 --> 03:57.737
-Your 40th birthday.
-[scoffs]

03:57.820 --> 04:00.156
Well, there's some
circular reasoning for you.

04:00.240 --> 04:02.617
I have no fear of getting older.

04:02.700 --> 04:05.286
It's just that all the choices disappear.

04:05.370 --> 04:07.872
Everything's been decided for me.

04:07.956 --> 04:10.667
I mean, I'm just locked into my life.

04:10.750 --> 04:14.254
Who I'm married to, who my children are,
what I do for a living,

04:14.337 --> 04:17.090
it's all done, all the doors are closed.

04:17.173 --> 04:20.593
There's only one door I haven't
walked through and I'm not eager to.

04:20.677 --> 04:22.011
So you feel trapped?

04:22.637 --> 04:24.514
What? No.

04:24.597 --> 04:25.974
I love my life.

04:26.057 --> 04:29.352
I just sometimes wonder what would happen
if it was blown to smithereens

04:29.435 --> 04:31.145
and I got to start all over again.

04:31.729 --> 04:32.647
Is that crazy?

04:32.730 --> 04:35.149
People blow up their lives all the time.

04:35.233 --> 04:37.986
Right. It's not like
my family's gonna disappear.

04:38.069 --> 04:42.407
I'm not gonna wake up one morning and find
out that Ethan is single, for example.

04:42.490 --> 04:44.450
That's not the main thing
I'm thinking about.

04:44.826 --> 04:46.703
You bring that up in every session.

04:47.245 --> 04:48.746
Well, someone's keeping score.

04:48.830 --> 04:50.415
I'm just observing a pattern.

04:50.498 --> 04:52.292
And I'm observing a pattern, too.

04:52.375 --> 04:54.544
Of hostile score-keeping.

04:56.337 --> 04:57.714

05:10.184 --> 05:11.227
[Nick groans]

05:11.811 --> 05:12.895
[Nick] Hold on one second.

05:18.568 --> 05:19.444
Hello.

05:19.527 --> 05:20.486
Hey.

05:20.570 --> 05:22.155
<i>Hey. Welcome home, mon!</i>

05:22.238 --> 05:24.574
I'm still on the plane. Um...

05:25.867 --> 05:27.493
I'm gonna call Ethan.

05:27.577 --> 05:29.829
He's right here, mon.
You want to talk to him, mon?

05:29.912 --> 05:31.539
No, I don't want to do that.

05:31.622 --> 05:34.542
I don't want him to even know
that this is me.

05:34.625 --> 05:36.711
Can you take a few steps away from him?

05:37.253 --> 05:38.421
Uh, alright.

05:39.297 --> 05:41.174
You look so hot in those goggles, bro.

05:41.591 --> 05:43.301
<i>I just wanted to let you know</i>

05:43.384 --> 05:46.137
that I am gonna tell Ethan what happened.

05:46.220 --> 05:48.181
<i>Unless you already have.</i>

05:48.264 --> 05:51.100
No. I did not.
Of course I wouldn't tell him. Right?

05:51.184 --> 05:54.228
There was nothing serious about it.
Isn't that what you said?

05:54.312 --> 05:57.899
Just one person fucking the other person's
dick off for eight hours.

05:57.982 --> 06:01.736
We're not gonna get back into this.
We're not gonna go down that road, okay?

06:01.819 --> 06:02.820
-Nick, look.
-No.

06:02.904 --> 06:04.113
Nick...

06:04.197 --> 06:05.406
[groans]

06:05.490 --> 06:08.201
<i>I need to tell Ethan.</i>
<i>I think it's the right thing to do.</i>

06:08.743 --> 06:10.953
Don't fucking say anything, okay?

06:11.037 --> 06:13.790
I've been through this before
and nothing good comes from it.

06:14.373 --> 06:16.584
I can't live with this anymore, I can't.

06:16.667 --> 06:18.878
I feel like I'm gonna throw up
all the time.

06:19.462 --> 06:20.630
Please don't, okay?

06:20.713 --> 06:23.925
Please don't say anything.
We have Sam's party coming up.

06:24.008 --> 06:27.386
I don't think we're going to that.
I'm gonna tell him as soon as I land.

06:27.470 --> 06:28.971
-Nick, look...
-Lisa...

06:29.055 --> 06:30.014
<i>Bye.</i>

06:30.848 --> 06:32.600
[Nick laughs] What?

06:32.683 --> 06:35.728
I'm gonna even return balls like that.
Watch this shit.

06:35.812 --> 06:37.522
-You don't even understand.
-Oh...

06:38.106 --> 06:39.816
[Ethan] Ready for some service?

06:39.899 --> 06:41.359
[cell phone rings]

06:42.360 --> 06:43.528
I'm gonna, um...

06:43.903 --> 06:46.155
-I'm just gonna grab some water, I think.
-Yeah.

06:46.239 --> 06:48.491
-I'm feeling, uh...
-Let me take this real quick.

06:48.574 --> 06:50.660
Okay. I just don't know if my water is--

06:50.743 --> 06:53.704
You're super in the way. Super in the way.
[chuckles]

06:54.122 --> 06:55.081
There we go.

06:55.164 --> 06:58.334
Haha! [in Caribbean accent] Ya, mon!
Have you landed, mon?

06:59.210 --> 07:01.671
Are you gonna be home when I get there?

07:01.754 --> 07:04.632
Ya, mon,
I'm planning on being home there

07:04.715 --> 07:07.760
and that you and I
are gonna go to the party together.

07:07.927 --> 07:09.804
<i>Uh, yeah, listen, um...</i>

07:11.180 --> 07:14.308
We need to talk before we go to Sam's.

07:14.392 --> 07:16.018
<i>We need to talk.</i>

07:16.686 --> 07:18.729
-What about?
<i>-It's better in person.</i>

07:19.063 --> 07:20.815
Are you okay? Did something happen?

07:20.898 --> 07:22.108
No, um...

07:24.110 --> 07:27.405
-You know, we'll talk soon.
-No, we can talk now. Lisa, please.

07:27.488 --> 07:29.031
<i>-Uh, I mean...</i>
<i>-</i>I'm...

07:29.115 --> 07:30.616
We'll talk later, okay?

07:30.700 --> 07:31.742
<i>Okay, bye.</i>

07:41.169 --> 07:43.129
-Uh, you good?
-Yeah.

07:47.341 --> 07:48.176
I'm good.

07:48.885 --> 07:51.095
[Sam] The gala,
I am not looking forward to it.

07:51.179 --> 07:52.472
-Hey, Sam.
-Hi.

07:52.555 --> 07:55.224
Can I just have her for just a second?
Thanks so much.

07:55.308 --> 07:57.894
I'm so sorry.
I will be right back, please excuse me.

07:58.436 --> 08:00.938
-What are you doing here?
-I think Lisa knows about us.

08:01.522 --> 08:02.607
What? How?

08:02.690 --> 08:06.152
She just called me from the runway
and said we need to talk in person.

08:06.235 --> 08:08.696
Nothing good ever happens
when a wife says that.

08:08.779 --> 08:11.032
Listen,
I am going to tell Lisa everything.

08:11.115 --> 08:12.116
-No.
-Yes.

08:12.200 --> 08:13.409
-No, you are not.
-Yes.

08:13.493 --> 08:16.996
-Yes, I am, Sam. I am, Sam.
-No, you're not. No!

08:17.079 --> 08:19.540
Stop! I am Sam
and you are not telling her anything!

08:19.624 --> 08:21.751
I'm going to tell her.
I wanted you to know.

08:21.834 --> 08:25.796
This is a decision that we make together
and I forbid you from saying a word.

08:26.380 --> 08:29.217
There's nothing to say, anyway.
We're done, remember?

08:29.300 --> 08:30.301
I know that.

08:30.384 --> 08:33.679
You don't get to blow up my marriage
and my children's lives

08:33.763 --> 08:35.306
to alleviate your conscience.

08:35.389 --> 08:38.518
If you feel better, I will tell her
I had the affair with someone else.

08:38.601 --> 08:40.770
Please! She'll figure out you're lying
within ten seconds.

08:40.853 --> 08:41.938
No, she won't.

08:42.021 --> 08:42.939
Listen.

08:43.856 --> 08:48.402
I wish it were as easy as telling Lisa
and moving on, but it isn't.

08:50.279 --> 08:53.783
It will change your marriage irrevocably
and mine, too.

08:54.158 --> 08:57.328
Obviously, but believe me,
I've given this a lot of thought.

08:57.411 --> 08:58.829
It's over.

08:58.913 --> 09:00.289
We're done.

09:00.373 --> 09:01.457
That's what matters.

09:04.085 --> 09:05.711
Please don't blow up my life.

09:05.795 --> 09:06.671
Please.

09:06.754 --> 09:09.715
Listen to me. Your kids are coming, okay.

09:11.175 --> 09:12.301
Mommy!

09:12.385 --> 09:13.636
-Hey!
-Mommy!

09:13.719 --> 09:15.388
Hello, my loves!

09:15.471 --> 09:17.098
-Hello!
-What's up, guys?

09:17.181 --> 09:19.141
Are you coming to karate with us?

09:19.225 --> 09:21.686
Are you talking about...
[makes high-pitched noises]

09:21.769 --> 09:24.105
I'm sorry, I can't guys. I wish I could.

09:24.188 --> 09:26.148
Let's go. Bye-bye, Ethan.

09:26.232 --> 09:28.317
-Bye-bye.
-[Sam] Bye-bye.

09:32.697 --> 09:34.740
[Sam] We'll give those ones
to the squirrels.

09:41.038 --> 09:44.542
[pilot] <i>Hi, folks. I have some bad news</i>
<i>from Ground Control.</i>

09:44.625 --> 09:47.712

<i>so we have to wait it out.</i>

09:47.795 --> 09:49.964
<i>Shouldn't be much more</i>

09:50.047 --> 09:52.049

[passengers groan]

09:53.551 --> 09:54.468
-Whoo!
-Yeah!

Okay, stop. Stop.

<i>We're gonna hand out</i>

10:08.566 --> 10:10.067

10:10.151 --> 10:11.736
[cheering]

10:11.819 --> 10:13.529
[sighs]

10:16.365 --> 10:18.117
<i>Hello, folks, me again.</i>

10:18.200 --> 10:20.620
<i>Traffic patterns are backed up all over,</i>

10:20.703 --> 10:22.872
<i>so we may be diverted to Newark.</i>

10:24.415 --> 10:26.292
<i>We'll have more information in an hour.</i>

10:26.375 --> 10:28.085
I don't wanna go to this party.

10:28.169 --> 10:31.756
What? A party with our college friends
and Ethan Turner doesn't wanna go?

10:31.839 --> 10:35.217
I just...
I want to be at home to meet Lisa.

10:35.301 --> 10:38.054
You know what I was thinking? Centaurs.

10:38.763 --> 10:40.056
-What?
-Your next book.

10:40.139 --> 10:41.891
Your next book after<i> Wolf Trials.</i>

10:41.974 --> 10:43.976
Centaurs, half-man, half-horse.

10:44.060 --> 10:46.020
Super buff, long hair,

10:46.103 --> 10:48.689
great posture, kind of forest-dwelling.

10:48.773 --> 10:51.108
-It'd be super cool.
-What the fuck are you talking about?

10:51.192 --> 10:55.071
You could just replace the word "werewolf"
for "centaur" in the document.

10:55.154 --> 10:57.615
Maybe we should probably see
how<i> Wolf Trials</i> does first.

10:57.698 --> 11:00.910
Yeah, although, you know,
never too soon to get on that next idea

11:00.993 --> 11:03.913
or even replace the current idea
with the new one.

11:03.996 --> 11:06.040
Max, I'm sorry, I just...

11:06.123 --> 11:08.209
I just finished a 400-page draft

11:08.292 --> 11:10.878
so I'm a little fucking tapped out
right now.

11:10.961 --> 11:12.463
You wrote 400 pages?

11:12.546 --> 11:14.673
-Yeah, it's a fucking book.
-Right.

11:16.300 --> 11:18.427
Are you mad?
Because you're swearing a lot.

11:18.511 --> 11:20.763
I just wanna fucking go home
and meet with Lisa.

11:20.846 --> 11:23.933
-That's all I wanna fucking do.
-Alright. F-word. Jeez!

11:24.016 --> 11:26.310
-Can we just get on the train, please?
-Like we're in a saloon.

11:46.747 --> 11:48.916
Haha! Va-va-voom!

11:49.959 --> 11:51.544
I want to cancel the party.

11:51.961 --> 11:53.879
I don't want to celebrate getting old!

11:53.963 --> 11:57.258
Oh, come on, it's gonna be terrific!

11:58.050 --> 11:59.385
It's too complicated.

11:59.468 --> 12:01.262
Why can't we just go out to dinner?

12:01.345 --> 12:04.598
We do that all the time.
You're turning 40! We're having a party.

12:04.682 --> 12:07.726
-That's what you do when you turn 40.
-Well, I don't want to.

12:07.810 --> 12:10.020
I wish you'd told me that six months ago.

12:10.104 --> 12:11.021
I did.

12:11.105 --> 12:12.523
Oh. Hm.

12:12.606 --> 12:14.525
Come on, it's gonna be great.

12:14.608 --> 12:16.068
You're gorgeous.

12:17.820 --> 12:19.405
Can you... [mumbles]

12:19.572 --> 12:22.533
I wonder if there's time for me
to take a nap.

12:24.577 --> 12:26.871
Does it ever creep you out
living in this house?

12:27.246 --> 12:30.666
Mmm... no, because I have nothing to hide.

12:32.126 --> 12:36.005
It did creep me out a little bit when that
bear threw the chair through the window.

12:37.631 --> 12:43.012
That means that he was inside the house
and wanted to get the hell out.

12:43.095 --> 12:46.056
Whenever you see me zoning out,
I'm thinking about that bear

12:46.140 --> 12:47.975
running around inside our house.

12:48.058 --> 12:49.143
Creepy.

12:50.060 --> 12:51.437
Doesn't make sense.

12:51.520 --> 12:54.690
-A bear doesn't have opposable thumbs.
-Stop talking about this bear thing.

12:55.357 --> 12:59.278
-Do you know where Pearl and Marianne are?
-No, I think they're outside playing.

12:59.904 --> 13:01.238
[Sam] Where?

13:01.822 --> 13:03.157
Now hit the brake.

13:03.699 --> 13:06.035
-Which one is the brake?
-The one on the left.

13:07.953 --> 13:09.288
Now put it in park.

13:11.248 --> 13:13.792
-Nice job.
-Can I have more Red Bull now?

13:14.335 --> 13:15.461
You bet.

13:15.544 --> 13:16.754
[Sam] Hi.

13:17.213 --> 13:18.797
Thank you so much for coming.

13:18.881 --> 13:19.757
Hello!

13:19.840 --> 13:21.884
-I'm old.
-[Max] Welcome to the club.

13:21.967 --> 13:23.677
I've got your membership papers.

13:23.761 --> 13:25.179
-You look great.
-Thank you.

13:25.262 --> 13:27.973
Hi, welcome to our shindig.
Good to see you.

13:28.057 --> 13:31.227
-Thanks for having us.
-I thought it was dress to impress.

13:31.310 --> 13:33.938
What else is impress?
This is impress, a tuxedo.

13:34.021 --> 13:37.024
-This is just... Tuesday.
-What?

13:37.107 --> 13:37.983
Oh!

13:38.317 --> 13:40.069
Oh, God, look, there's Lisa.

13:40.569 --> 13:42.071
-Yay!
-Oh, hey!

13:42.154 --> 13:43.072
-Hey, you.
-Hi.

13:43.155 --> 13:45.199
Oh, my God. What happened to your ankle?

13:45.282 --> 13:46.909
[Lisa] I sprained it.

13:46.992 --> 13:48.035
[Ethan] You got some color.

13:48.118 --> 13:50.037
-There was a lot of...
-Hi.

13:50.120 --> 13:52.498
-Hi!
-What happened? Do you need a little help?

13:52.581 --> 13:55.793
Don't worry about little old me.
Happy birthday.

13:55.876 --> 13:58.546
-Oh, thank you.
-Wow, this is-- Oh.

13:58.629 --> 14:02.007
Can I use your restroom just to
wash my face and just kind of clean up?

14:02.091 --> 14:04.218
-I feel disgusting.
-Yeah. Right down here.

14:04.301 --> 14:05.177
I'll take her.

14:05.261 --> 14:08.973
This is not what I thought I'd wear
to your 40th but this is what I'm wearing.

14:09.056 --> 14:10.558
Great. You look wonderful.

14:10.641 --> 14:13.185
It's just... in there.

14:13.852 --> 14:15.187
Hand towels on the bottom.

14:15.271 --> 14:17.565
-[Lisa] Yeah. Okay.
-[Ethan] Mm-hmm.

14:19.066 --> 14:22.361
Give me a minute to talk to my wife?
I haven't seen her in a week.

14:22.444 --> 14:25.781
-What's your plan?
-My plan is to tell her about us

14:25.865 --> 14:27.908
before she brings it up first, okay?

14:27.992 --> 14:29.827
Did you see how she just greeted me?

14:29.910 --> 14:31.871
-She definitely knows.
-She doesn't know.

14:31.954 --> 14:33.747
-She knows.
-That is an insane plan.

14:36.584 --> 14:38.085
-Hi.
-Hi.

14:38.794 --> 14:40.004
I need to talk to you.

14:40.546 --> 14:41.839
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

14:43.382 --> 14:45.759
You know what? Let's go get a drink.
We can talk.

14:45.843 --> 14:47.261
-Yeah.
-Okay.

14:49.096 --> 14:50.723
-[whispers] Fuck you.
-Fuck you!

14:52.433 --> 14:53.517
-[Nick] Hey, buddy.
-Hey.

14:53.601 --> 14:56.270
Wow. Don't they sell sunblock
in the Caymans?

14:56.353 --> 14:59.231
Look, I haven't had a second
to talk to Ethan yet.

14:59.315 --> 15:01.901
-Okay? So just...
-Me, neither. I'm so sorry.

15:01.984 --> 15:04.695
I've been wanting to tell him everything
to his face.

15:04.778 --> 15:06.488
Stop it, this isn't funny, okay?

15:06.572 --> 15:10.618
I'm not gonna be able to talk to him until
we leave so let that inform your behavior.

15:10.701 --> 15:11.952
-Fine. Yeah.
-Please?

15:12.036 --> 15:15.706
Lisa, I want to introduce you
to my fiancée, Dustry.

15:15.789 --> 15:18.500
-Oh.
-Yeah, we're engaged to be married.

15:18.584 --> 15:20.419
-Wow.
-Lisa, look.

15:21.128 --> 15:22.713
-Lisa, look.
-It's beautiful.

15:23.380 --> 15:25.841
-Lisa, look.
-I see, yeah. It's really lovely.

15:25.925 --> 15:28.928
I, like, still can't even believe it.
It's like...

15:29.011 --> 15:30.012
[makes a bleating noise]

15:30.095 --> 15:30.971
Like...

15:31.055 --> 15:31.889
[bleats]

15:31.972 --> 15:33.933
-Yeah.
-Holy moly. Who is this?

15:34.016 --> 15:35.434
What is that?

15:35.517 --> 15:38.312
Oh. Uh, this is my fiancée, Dustry.

15:38.395 --> 15:40.189
We're engaged to be married.

15:40.272 --> 15:42.608
-Well, congratulations.
-I know, I was like...

15:42.691 --> 15:43.567
[bleats]

15:43.651 --> 15:44.526
Just like...

15:44.610 --> 15:45.444
[bleats]

15:45.527 --> 15:47.821
-Like...
-[Nick] Yeah, I was, too.

15:47.905 --> 15:50.616
-Bear, you're so cute!
-You're cute, Bug.

15:50.699 --> 15:52.701
I want to show you these bouquets.

15:52.785 --> 15:53.827
What for?

15:53.911 --> 15:55.162
For our wedding.

15:55.245 --> 15:56.789
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

16:00.793 --> 16:03.796
-What is going on with those two?
-I have no idea.

16:03.879 --> 16:05.756
Oh, how were the Caymans?

16:06.048 --> 16:07.007
[sighs]

16:07.675 --> 16:08.926
Terrible.

16:12.930 --> 16:14.556
-I'll take-- Yeah. Mm-hmm.
-Yeah.

16:20.396 --> 16:21.981
[whispers] You're right. She knows.

16:22.064 --> 16:25.234
Ladies and gentlemen,
grab your coats and come on outside

16:25.317 --> 16:27.903
for a special presentation.

16:28.654 --> 16:32.324
Uh, as you all know, my wife, Samantha,

16:32.408 --> 16:34.118
loves a good surprise.

16:34.201 --> 16:37.037
Oh, no. What have you done?

16:37.121 --> 16:39.289
Which is why your friends and I

16:39.373 --> 16:43.002
have organized a very special...

16:43.085 --> 16:45.129
[Dash and Pearl] Night of surprises!

16:45.212 --> 16:46.672
[guests gasp]

16:47.798 --> 16:49.049
I helped with the sign!

16:49.133 --> 16:51.051
It's beautiful, I love it.

16:51.135 --> 16:53.303
[Jon] For my first surprise,

16:53.387 --> 16:56.140
and don't worry, honey,
because I've got a few,

16:56.223 --> 16:59.435
let me introduce Nils Michelson.

16:59.518 --> 17:02.146
Come over here, everybody,
gather round over here.

17:02.229 --> 17:03.856
[dramatic fanfare music]

17:03.939 --> 17:05.065
[Jon] Right over here.

17:05.816 --> 17:09.862
Can anyone tell me what the most
dangerous weapon in the world is?

17:09.945 --> 17:11.947
-[Ethan] Machine gun?
-[Max] Two machine guns?

17:12.031 --> 17:13.574
-No.
-Nuclear weapons.

17:13.657 --> 17:14.825
-That's good.
-Bomb.

17:14.908 --> 17:17.036
-It's a bow and arrow.
-[Max] He's not right.

17:17.119 --> 17:19.246
That's not right.
A nuclear weapon would...

17:19.329 --> 17:21.457
[Nils] Now we all know it's bow and arrow,

17:21.540 --> 17:22.916
let's start the show.

17:23.584 --> 17:25.044
[dramatic music plays]

17:26.378 --> 17:27.254
[guests gasp]

17:29.798 --> 17:30.841
[guests] Oh!

17:36.472 --> 17:38.015
[Max] Wow, look at that!

17:40.184 --> 17:41.727
Oh!

17:44.730 --> 17:46.190
[panicked chatter]

17:54.782 --> 17:56.033
[guests applaud]

17:56.116 --> 17:59.703
Alright, for my next surprise,
let's all go into the dining room.

17:59.787 --> 18:02.164
-[Ethan] That's us. We gotta go!
-[Nils] I need to get paid.

18:02.247 --> 18:05.209
-[Ethan] Friend group, let's go.
-[Marianne] Friend group.

18:05.292 --> 18:07.836
So let's just run lines one more time
from the top.

18:07.920 --> 18:10.422
-I'm good, I'll just read it.
-We said no scripts.

18:10.506 --> 18:13.926
-We said we're gonna do this off book.
-Are we sure we want do this?

18:14.009 --> 18:17.721
Of course we want to do this! This is
<i>Monica Lewinsky, The Musical,</i> guys.

18:17.805 --> 18:20.599
-That's right.
-That's why you got a stain on the jacket.

18:20.682 --> 18:21.517
Sorry!

18:21.600 --> 18:24.186
This is one of the surprises
in the Night of Surprises.

18:24.269 --> 18:26.146
We gotta do it or else it's just a night.

18:26.230 --> 18:30.067
In my experience, a performance
has to answer two fundamental questions.

18:30.150 --> 18:34.363
-Why here, why now?
-Exactly, and this answers none of them.

18:34.446 --> 18:36.031
I think Marianne's right.

18:36.115 --> 18:39.576
This is a very elegant party.
I think it could be disrespectful.

18:39.660 --> 18:40.494
Agreed.

18:40.577 --> 18:43.705
[as Bill Clinton] I think it's gonna be
a lot of fun for everybody involved.

18:43.789 --> 18:46.792
I don't want to play Linda Tripp.
I always play Linda Tripp.

18:46.875 --> 18:49.044
I never get to play the good characters.

18:49.128 --> 18:52.631
Come on, the play is not terrible.
We're doing this for Sam. It's sweet.

18:52.714 --> 18:54.299
-The play's really good.
-Yes!

18:54.383 --> 18:58.887
It seems irrelevant and depressing,
given the way things turned out.

18:58.971 --> 19:03.392
Well, I think it's a great opportunity
for people to relive my legacy.

19:03.976 --> 19:06.562
[as Obama] I've gotta tell you,
Bill, I think it's a bad idea.

19:06.645 --> 19:09.398
It does not paint you in a good light.

19:09.481 --> 19:11.859
[as Trump] And I wanna say
that both of you are stupid,

19:11.942 --> 19:15.112
your wife and your daughter together,
equal a six, okay?

19:15.195 --> 19:17.406
She's a three, she's a two, they're a six.

19:17.489 --> 19:18.866
[as Clinton] That's faulty math.

19:18.949 --> 19:21.243
-Stop it!
-Stop! Stop doing the thing!

19:21.326 --> 19:22.536
-Stop!
-It's annoying.

19:22.619 --> 19:27.332
Guys, listen. Do you remember our
performance at the Leverett Old Library?

19:27.416 --> 19:28.250
Okay?

19:28.333 --> 19:32.254
The students complained because the
laughter was so loud nobody could study.

19:32.337 --> 19:34.173
Do you remember that? That laughter?

19:34.256 --> 19:37.134
That's what we gotta get back to.
That's how good this is!

19:37.217 --> 19:39.303
I don't know,
the second you said students,

19:39.386 --> 19:41.013
it reminded me that was 20 years ago.

19:41.096 --> 19:42.431
Maybe it doesn't hold up.

19:42.514 --> 19:44.850
Max, the play sucks.

19:44.933 --> 19:46.143
You suck, Marianne!

19:46.226 --> 19:48.478
-You know what else sucks? Your play.
-Don't.

19:48.562 --> 19:52.191
That stupid gender-bending
<i>Streetcar Named Desire</i> play.

19:52.274 --> 19:54.234
-That was a disaster.
-[Ethan] Max...

19:54.818 --> 19:55.903
[Nick] Ooh.

19:56.361 --> 19:57.613
I'm sorry, that...

19:58.113 --> 20:00.490
I didn't mean that.
I love you, Marianne. I'm sorry.

20:00.574 --> 20:03.660
I get carried away when I put on the wig
and I become Kenneth Starr

20:03.744 --> 20:06.705
and I just attack
without provocation or evidence.

20:06.788 --> 20:09.791
-I get a little... "Monica-rena."
-["Macarena" plays]

20:09.875 --> 20:11.793
-Do you hear the "Monica-rena"?
-Yes. Max...

20:11.877 --> 20:14.630
That's the show! It's started.
It's out of our hands.

20:14.713 --> 20:15.923
We gotta finish the show.

20:16.006 --> 20:19.218
And people are gonna love it, okay?
Here we go, off-book!

20:19.676 --> 20:21.970
-I don't want to do this.
-I know, man, I know.

20:22.054 --> 20:24.181
I look like a Hasidic Garth.

20:48.288 --> 20:49.498
Good evening.

20:49.998 --> 20:53.335
I am Kenneth Starr
and I request your attention.

20:53.835 --> 20:55.128
Guys, hands on hips.

20:55.212 --> 20:56.588
Turn off the music.

20:57.881 --> 21:00.968
-I thought you wanted me to--
-[Ethan] Stop the music.

21:01.051 --> 21:02.886
Turn off the music.

21:02.970 --> 21:05.931
-Okay. This is all part of the thing.
-[Max stammers]

21:08.725 --> 21:12.646
Hey, um... As some of Sam's
closest friends,

21:12.729 --> 21:14.856
we'd like to say...

21:20.946 --> 21:24.616
-[whispers] Take it easy, Counselor.
-Gotta think it through. We had a plan--

21:24.700 --> 21:26.702
Shut the fuck up.
<i>Streetcar</i> was awesome.

21:26.785 --> 21:28.245
It was shit and this is shit.

21:28.328 --> 21:30.580
-[indistinct whispers]
-Shh.

21:32.582 --> 21:39.172
♪ <i>Happy birthday to you </i>♪

21:39.256 --> 21:44.136
-♪ <i>Happy birthday to you </i>♪
-No, no, no!

21:44.219 --> 21:46.263
No. We haven't even had dinner yet.

21:46.346 --> 21:48.890
Hold on. We haven't had dinner.

21:48.974 --> 21:51.727
We haven't... It's too soon.
[nervous chuckle]

21:52.227 --> 21:53.854
Sorry, my bad, I guess. Uh...

21:54.021 --> 21:55.731
-I guess we should eat...
-Yeah.

21:55.814 --> 21:57.733
-And then we'll...
-[Ethan] Sorry about that.

22:00.986 --> 22:02.112
What's happening?

22:02.195 --> 22:05.240
Forget it, we're not doing it.
You guys win.

22:07.284 --> 22:08.702
Well, that was great!

22:08.785 --> 22:10.620
Thank you guys so much!

22:11.079 --> 22:12.622
Hey, everybody, let's eat.

22:12.706 --> 22:15.334
-Happy birthday, Sam.
-Thank you. Thank you.

22:15.459 --> 22:17.210
-That was a roller coaster.
-It was.

22:30.057 --> 22:32.726
-Hi. Can I talk to you?
-What's up?

22:33.310 --> 22:34.561
-[angrily] Ethan!
-Yeah?

22:34.644 --> 22:37.397
-Hi. Can you come over here?
-Sure, honey.

22:40.567 --> 22:41.985
What's up?

22:42.402 --> 22:43.487
Anastasia.

22:43.570 --> 22:45.572
I didn't know she was invited tonight.

22:45.655 --> 22:48.450
She wasn't.
I found her outside by the pool.

22:49.659 --> 22:50.535
Okay.

22:51.078 --> 22:52.496
This is my rabbit.

22:52.579 --> 22:56.208
Not the impostor one that you tried
to pass off on me, whom I love now, too.

22:57.834 --> 23:00.378
I don't know what this is.
I'm going back to the party.

23:00.462 --> 23:02.172
Sam, get over here now.

23:03.799 --> 23:05.759
You were supposed
to take Anastasia to the vet,

23:05.842 --> 23:09.221
yet she ended up here, 50 miles away
in Connecticut, in Sam's house,

23:09.304 --> 23:11.598
which means
you two are still having an affair.

23:11.681 --> 23:14.017
-[laughs nervously]
-Hang on, how does she know about us?

23:14.101 --> 23:17.729
Sam, when you told me that it was over,
I believed you. And I was so relieved.

23:17.813 --> 23:19.689
How long have you known about us?

23:19.773 --> 23:22.442
Why do you care about this so much?
This is not your life.

23:22.526 --> 23:24.986
Why do I care so much?
It's because I love you guys.

23:25.946 --> 23:26.905
You're my family.

23:26.988 --> 23:30.534
No! I have a family
and they are sitting right over there.

23:31.118 --> 23:33.328
Oh, my God, Sam, you know what I mean.

23:33.411 --> 23:36.289
She knows everything?
Why did you tell her?

23:36.998 --> 23:40.001
I am a human being.
I need someone to talk to.

23:40.085 --> 23:41.753
Okay, I have to tell Lisa, okay?

23:41.837 --> 23:44.631
She already knows,
and apparently everybody else does too,

23:44.714 --> 23:47.134
and it'll make it better
if I get to her first.

23:47.217 --> 23:49.010
-You can't.
-I think you should.

23:49.094 --> 23:51.221
-Thank you, Marianne.
-No, please.

23:51.304 --> 23:54.015
Please, Ethan, please don't,
it's my birthday.

23:55.684 --> 23:58.019
I'm gonna take Anastasia to the bedroom

23:58.103 --> 23:59.896
where she will eat most of your shoes.

24:02.858 --> 24:04.818
Hey, is everything okay?

24:04.901 --> 24:07.571
So many secrets. Poisonous secrets.

24:13.535 --> 24:14.703
-Lisa.
-Yes?

24:14.786 --> 24:17.372
-Can we go for just a second, have a word?
-Yeah.

24:17.455 --> 24:18.790
A toast.

24:18.874 --> 24:20.917
To my wonderful husband, Jon.

24:22.419 --> 24:24.504
We're so lucky to have so much.

24:25.547 --> 24:27.966
Let's all reflect for a moment
on our good fortune,

24:28.049 --> 24:32.304
which is so rare
and so precarious in this world.

24:33.388 --> 24:34.347
Cheers.

24:34.890 --> 24:36.474
[all] Cheers.

24:37.976 --> 24:39.311
[crowd] Aww...

24:41.271 --> 24:42.105
Perfect.

24:43.773 --> 24:46.484
Okay, so I have one last surprise.

24:47.152 --> 24:49.112
Hello, my beautiful friends.

24:49.196 --> 24:52.532
I am Ken Yurubi. The Mentalist.

24:52.616 --> 24:54.618
[excited chatter]

24:55.076 --> 24:56.369
Like the TV show?

24:57.120 --> 24:59.581
Well, actually,
<i>The Mentalist</i> was based on me.

24:59.664 --> 25:01.208
Man, you must be loaded!

25:01.291 --> 25:04.085
No, I... No, they didn't...

25:04.169 --> 25:06.213
Forget it. Forget that.

25:06.296 --> 25:10.175
I am here to tell you all
what's in your minds.

25:10.258 --> 25:12.886
[Jon] Ken did a corporate retreat for us
a few months ago

25:12.969 --> 25:15.138
and what he can do, it's just astounding.

25:15.222 --> 25:17.432
No, no. [laughs nervously]

25:17.515 --> 25:18.725
Okay.

25:18.808 --> 25:24.189
Now, folks, I have been watching you
at this little party all night.

25:24.272 --> 25:25.774
[guests groan]

25:25.857 --> 25:28.235
And I just can't wait
to get inside your heads!

25:28.902 --> 25:32.197
Okay. Now, where shall we begin?

25:32.280 --> 25:34.407
[hums indistinctly]

25:34.491 --> 25:35.951
Excuse me,<i> True Blood.</i>

25:36.034 --> 25:37.661
Okay.

25:38.620 --> 25:39.579
-Hi.
-Hi.

25:39.663 --> 25:41.498
-How are you? I'm Ken.
-I'm good.

25:41.581 --> 25:43.166
-Hi, Ken.
-Okay.

25:44.125 --> 25:47.003
You don't tell me who you are. I know.

25:47.087 --> 25:49.589
-Oh.
-Wait. I see a star.

25:51.925 --> 25:53.009
In the night sky.

25:53.593 --> 25:55.595
Star for Stella.<i> Streetcar!</i>

25:55.679 --> 25:57.138
-I was in<i> Streetcar!</i>
-Yes.

25:57.222 --> 25:59.224
-That was my line!
-Yes.

25:59.307 --> 26:01.476
You led him to it.
Marianne, you led him to it.

26:01.559 --> 26:04.145
-This isn't real.
-No, watch. Just watch.

26:04.229 --> 26:06.690
-I see a man.
-Oh, my God, Tag.

26:06.773 --> 26:08.608
-Mm. Mm-hmm.
-[Max] Holy shit.

26:08.692 --> 26:10.735
Guys, nothing is happening.

26:10.819 --> 26:13.029
No, Max, nothing's happening right now.

26:13.113 --> 26:14.948
How does he know everything about Tag?

26:15.031 --> 26:17.325
Did you play the violin as a child?

26:17.409 --> 26:18.618
Yes, I did!

26:18.702 --> 26:19.869
[guests gasp]

26:19.953 --> 26:21.454
-That's what I thought.
-Wow.

26:21.538 --> 26:22.789
You're gay.

26:22.872 --> 26:24.249
[tentative applause]

26:27.460 --> 26:29.921
-[Ethan] Obviously?
-Great accomplishment of mine.

26:30.005 --> 26:31.172
I see a man...

26:32.257 --> 26:33.675
F... F...

26:33.758 --> 26:35.677
-Felix!
-Felix!

26:35.760 --> 26:36.678
-Felix?
-Felix.

26:36.761 --> 26:38.555
-Felix, yeah.
-Felix. Yes.

26:38.638 --> 26:40.640
But Felix isn't, he's not here.

26:40.724 --> 26:42.309
No, and that's sad.

26:42.392 --> 26:44.602
You feel... lonely

26:44.686 --> 26:47.147
and lost at sea.

26:49.983 --> 26:51.609
No, no, no, no. Okay.

26:51.693 --> 26:53.945
Yeah, fine. Thank you.

26:54.029 --> 26:55.530
Come to The Mentalist.

26:55.613 --> 26:57.157
No, I think she needs a hug.

26:57.240 --> 26:58.616
There we go.

26:59.534 --> 27:00.869
She gets a hug.

27:01.369 --> 27:03.997
-Good.
-Why are you clapping?

27:04.080 --> 27:06.291
-Okay.
-Alright, dude.

27:06.374 --> 27:08.793
Can I tell you something about you?
You're in love.

27:09.336 --> 27:10.503
[guests laugh]

27:11.463 --> 27:12.964
Yeah, that's my fiancée.

27:13.882 --> 27:14.758
Not with her.

27:14.841 --> 27:16.009
[guests] Ooh!

27:16.551 --> 27:18.803
Okay, this is not real, so don't worry.

27:20.096 --> 27:23.016
-Tell her it's not real, please.
-I'm not gonna lie to her.

27:23.099 --> 27:26.019
-Tell her it's not real.
-Why would I say that? It's real.

27:26.102 --> 27:27.937
We're all flesh and blood right here.

27:28.021 --> 27:29.314
It's totally fake.

27:29.397 --> 27:31.941
-Okay, no, it's totally real.
-No, it's fake.

27:32.025 --> 27:33.902
No, it's real. Real.

27:34.402 --> 27:35.236
Now...

27:35.945 --> 27:38.907
[Ethan whispers] I do not wanna do this.
I don't even see what the...

27:38.990 --> 27:41.534
And just because of that,
I'm going to you now.

27:41.618 --> 27:45.580
-Don't you think he should be next, folks?
-[guests] Yes!

27:47.082 --> 27:50.835
[in goofy voice] No, no, no, no.
We ain't doing it. Don't do it.

27:50.919 --> 27:54.172
I think someone is nervous
because of the secret.

27:54.255 --> 27:55.131
[Sam gasps]

27:55.215 --> 27:56.466
Oh!

28:00.011 --> 28:01.096
[Ken] Ah!

28:02.514 --> 28:03.348
He!

28:07.519 --> 28:09.020
I had sex with Nick.

28:09.104 --> 28:10.605
[guests gasp]

28:12.107 --> 28:13.400
Oh, my God!

28:13.483 --> 28:15.652
-No. No, mon.
-Whoa!

28:15.735 --> 28:16.736
When?

28:17.987 --> 28:21.783
-Last week in the Caymans.
-[Nick] No. We didn't. It was...

28:21.866 --> 28:23.034
No.

28:23.118 --> 28:25.328
I... I'm so sorry.

28:29.958 --> 28:30.834
Dustry.

28:31.251 --> 28:33.086
This is what happened at the retreat.

28:33.169 --> 28:37.382
Ken just breaks everyone down.
It's just... [sighs]

28:38.383 --> 28:41.803
So then why would you bring him
to my birthday party?

28:41.886 --> 28:43.138
Because I...

28:44.973 --> 28:46.641
I told you I knew how to drive.

28:46.725 --> 28:48.435
Can I try?

28:48.518 --> 28:50.937
No. You're too young. Sorry.

28:51.563 --> 28:54.566
[Pearl gasps] Cake! Come on, cake!

28:55.024 --> 28:56.735
[Pearl and Dash] Cake, cake!

28:56.818 --> 28:58.153
Cake!

28:58.236 --> 28:59.946
-Yeah!
-Cake!

29:01.865 --> 29:04.325
Babe, I'm so sorry.

29:06.035 --> 29:08.872
I love you so much.
I have no idea what happened.

29:09.873 --> 29:11.708
I was out of my mind.

29:11.791 --> 29:14.377
I think... after the wedding, um...

29:15.003 --> 29:16.671
I got crazy and I got paranoid

29:16.755 --> 29:19.966
and I thought something was happening
between you and Sam.

29:20.049 --> 29:22.927
God, I don't know how
you can ever forgive me, but I...

29:24.095 --> 29:25.597
I really hope that you do.

29:25.680 --> 29:27.056
I forgive you.

29:29.809 --> 29:30.643
What?

29:31.144 --> 29:32.729
I said I forgive you.

29:33.271 --> 29:36.483
Um, I love you
and that's all that matters.

29:38.193 --> 29:41.029
You... You forgave me really quickly.

29:41.112 --> 29:43.323
Do you want me to be mad?

29:43.406 --> 29:46.075
[stammers] Would that make it better?

29:47.327 --> 29:48.620
I think it would be better.

29:48.703 --> 29:51.915
I don't think that
I would do something like this

29:51.998 --> 29:55.502
unless I was trying to get
a reaction from you.

29:58.296 --> 30:00.048
Is Sam's car moving?

30:00.965 --> 30:03.343
Sam's car's moving...
Okay, hold on.

30:03.760 --> 30:06.262
Sam? Sam!
I need your car keys right now.

30:06.346 --> 30:09.390
-I don't have them.
-Your car is rolling toward the pool.

30:09.474 --> 30:11.476
What? Oh my, God.

30:11.559 --> 30:13.686
-Oh, my God.
-Do you have keys?

30:13.770 --> 30:16.064
I don't know where the keys are.
Oh, my God!

30:17.774 --> 30:19.567
-Keys are in the car!
-What are we gonna do?

30:19.651 --> 30:20.819
[Sam] We have to stop the car.

30:22.028 --> 30:25.031
-Smash the glass!
-I got the bulletproof glass, we can't.

30:25.114 --> 30:26.574
We're not that important!

30:26.658 --> 30:29.327
-I feel our friendship's in a weird place.
-[shouts] We're fine!

30:29.410 --> 30:32.247
Hey, I should mention to you,
someone in my department

30:32.330 --> 30:35.583
sold a book called<i> Wolf Trials</i>
that I knew about but forgot existed.

30:36.125 --> 30:37.252
[all groan]

30:38.461 --> 30:39.295
Ow!

30:39.379 --> 30:42.048
-My hand!
-You said we were fine!

30:43.383 --> 30:45.301
This thing just broke my foot!

30:45.718 --> 30:46.761
[shrieks]

30:47.679 --> 30:48.888
[Jon] No!

30:52.141 --> 30:53.101
[Ethan] It's going in!

30:55.812 --> 30:57.188
It's going in the pool.

30:58.606 --> 31:00.400
Did you leave it in neutral?

31:00.483 --> 31:02.861
Of course not. I'm not a child.

31:03.236 --> 31:04.070
Oh, no.

31:05.113 --> 31:06.364
Why did you say, "Oh, no"?

31:06.781 --> 31:08.992
In general. Oh, no!

31:10.368 --> 31:12.161
I'm sorry about<i> Wolf Trials.</i>

31:13.413 --> 31:15.665
Well, at least
we still have your income, so...

31:15.748 --> 31:18.376
Oh. Right. I quit.

31:21.087 --> 31:22.088
[Jon] Champagne?

31:22.171 --> 31:23.882
Great. Let's celebrate.

31:25.925 --> 31:31.723
♪ <i>Happy birthday to you </i>♪

31:31.806 --> 31:37.353
-♪ <i>Happy birthday to you </i>♪
-[laughing]

31:40.773 --> 31:42.650
Sam's car. Had it coming.

31:43.860 --> 31:45.153
[all laugh]

31:46.029 --> 31:47.155
[Lisa] Oh, that's funny.

31:47.822 --> 31:49.198
That's not it.

31:50.533 --> 31:52.452
I think we should take a break.

31:52.911 --> 31:54.829
[soft rock song plays]

32:00.376 --> 32:02.295
[Jon] Oh, right. Fireworks.

32:02.378 --> 32:05.465
That's your last surprise tonight,
sweetie.

32:05.548 --> 32:07.800
Here. [makes pinging sound]
