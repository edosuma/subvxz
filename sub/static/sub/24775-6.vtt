00:09.200 --> 00:12.760
During working hours,
you've had 2,000 cheeseburgers

00:12.840 --> 00:15.560
- and 500 milkshakes.
- Society should include everyone.

00:15.640 --> 00:19.160
- That's how it's always been.
- I need someone with more ambition.

00:19.240 --> 00:21.640
You've started a deep-fat-fryer fire
five times.

00:21.720 --> 00:26.000
I've never met a person that I couldn't
help move on and make a fresh start.

00:26.080 --> 00:28.040
Someone nicer. And hotter, I guess.

00:28.120 --> 00:30.000
So don't bother coming to work tomorrow.

00:30.080 --> 00:33.240
- I just don't know how to help you.
- Someone who isn't you.

00:34.680 --> 00:35.680
Patrick.

00:37.760 --> 00:38.760
Hello, Patrick.

00:40.000 --> 00:46.074

02:00.000 --> 02:01.360
It's kind of nice here.

02:03.280 --> 02:04.280
Yeah.

02:06.120 --> 02:07.960
What if this is the best place there is?

02:08.639 --> 02:09.639
What do you mean?

02:10.320 --> 02:13.800
We don't know
what's on the other side of the wall.

02:14.600 --> 02:18.160
And right now,
the zone feels like our place.

02:19.360 --> 02:21.000
This sure as hell isn't my place.

02:21.880 --> 02:24.120
No, but as long as we're here,
we have time to...

02:24.200 --> 02:28.160
We're only here because we didn't think
there was any other place to go.

02:28.240 --> 02:30.960
But if we weren't here,
you and I would never have met.

02:32.240 --> 02:34.600
No. Come on, we're not really friends.

02:43.760 --> 02:45.400
It's them. The Strangers.

02:54.480 --> 02:55.840
They're getting closer.

02:57.360 --> 02:59.120
Shit, what was that?

03:11.600 --> 03:12.600
What the fuck?

03:15.280 --> 03:16.280
It's definitely sick.

03:23.440 --> 03:25.760
I'm trying not to kill
everything we come across.

03:33.560 --> 03:34.560
Okay.

03:36.040 --> 03:38.120
They're in Sector Five now.

03:38.600 --> 03:40.600
- Yeah.
- They went through six,

03:40.680 --> 03:42.320
seven and eight...

03:42.400 --> 03:44.080
- Yeah.
- During the night...

03:45.040 --> 03:46.160
and we're here in three.

03:46.240 --> 03:48.760
If they're already that close to us,

03:48.840 --> 03:51.040
then it's too risky
to go to the next bunker.

03:51.120 --> 03:52.920
But we have to. We need more food.

03:53.000 --> 03:55.280
We don't know for sure
if there is any food there.

03:55.360 --> 03:58.360
I know, but we'll just do
a quick search, right?

03:58.440 --> 04:00.120
We have no other option.

04:00.880 --> 04:02.920
Martin, we have to get food now.

04:04.480 --> 04:05.480
Right?

04:08.120 --> 04:09.640
Okay. Come. We have to leave.

04:11.600 --> 04:12.600
Now.

04:13.200 --> 04:14.840
- I can't.
- What?

04:16.760 --> 04:17.800
I can't get up.

04:17.880 --> 04:19.120
You can't get up now?

04:19.560 --> 04:21.399
- No.
- Why not?

04:22.760 --> 04:25.160
Listen, we're all sore. Come on.

04:28.320 --> 04:30.000
- I can't get up.
- Hey.

04:30.080 --> 04:31.440
What's going on?

04:31.520 --> 04:33.680
- What's up?
- I can't move at all.

04:35.280 --> 04:37.080
It's that fucking infection.

04:41.080 --> 04:43.760
You guys will have to go
to the bunker and get the food...

04:44.360 --> 04:46.000
then we'll meet here and move on.

04:46.080 --> 04:48.440
Sure, if you'll cut off your hand.

04:49.440 --> 04:51.360
So that we can access the bunker.

04:52.680 --> 04:53.880
It was a joke.

04:54.320 --> 04:57.920
Very funny, Patrick. Maybe you could come
up with a solution instead of a joke.

04:59.000 --> 05:00.160
Beatrice could stay.

05:05.840 --> 05:06.840
Okay.

05:07.840 --> 05:08.840
I could do that.

05:10.120 --> 05:13.200
Patrick, you can carry
more than me anyway.

05:16.480 --> 05:17.480
Yeah.

05:20.280 --> 05:21.280
That's the plan.

05:21.360 --> 05:23.600
If anyone comes, you have to take off.

05:27.840 --> 05:28.840
Yes.

05:36.720 --> 05:37.720
What's up?

05:42.160 --> 05:44.200
Look after him, okay?

05:46.600 --> 05:49.560
- Yeah, that's why I'm staying behind.
- No, you...

05:50.960 --> 05:51.960
He likes you.

05:54.040 --> 05:55.040
You know?

05:56.200 --> 05:57.800
And how do you feel about that?

06:04.240 --> 06:05.240
Well?

06:07.880 --> 06:08.880
I don't know.

06:16.520 --> 06:18.520
You have a good rapport, you and Simone.

06:23.280 --> 06:24.400
Yeah, maybe.

06:24.480 --> 06:25.760
We never did.

06:25.840 --> 06:27.160
Definitely not.

06:28.400 --> 06:29.840
We mostly argued.

06:30.880 --> 06:33.600
- All the time.
- Yeah, we really nailed that part.

06:37.320 --> 06:38.320
Yeah.

06:39.840 --> 06:40.960
Be careful, okay?

07:23.800 --> 07:24.800
Did they leave?

07:26.160 --> 07:27.160
Yes.

07:34.080 --> 07:37.160
- Why are you looking at me like that?
- I want to show you something.

07:42.320 --> 07:43.440
It's gone.

07:44.120 --> 07:45.440
That's insane.

07:46.560 --> 07:47.800
How is that possible?

07:50.840 --> 07:52.520
- When did it happen?
- I don't know.

07:56.120 --> 07:57.240
That's so weird.

07:57.320 --> 07:59.280
- It doesn't hurt?
- No.

07:59.920 --> 08:01.800
So you were faking it before?

08:04.280 --> 08:05.480
- Yeah.
- Seriously?

08:06.640 --> 08:10.920
So the Strangers are after us,
and people are starting to panic,

08:11.000 --> 08:12.560
and you decide to play hooky?

08:12.640 --> 08:14.040
I just felt like it.

08:16.600 --> 08:18.040
So now it's just you and me.

08:29.600 --> 08:30.800
That was a good spot.

08:34.360 --> 08:35.400
- How about here?
- Yes.

08:43.320 --> 08:44.320
Let me see.

08:45.760 --> 08:47.240
- Let me see.
- It's not done yet.

09:09.680 --> 09:11.920
- What are you doing?
- Taking my pills.

09:13.600 --> 09:15.200
You're feeling better, right?

09:16.120 --> 09:17.120
Yes.

09:18.080 --> 09:19.080
Then don't take them.

09:21.880 --> 09:23.320
You don't really need them.

09:25.720 --> 09:26.760
Okay.

09:47.600 --> 09:49.280
Straight ahead.

09:52.160 --> 09:53.280
Shit.

10:35.480 --> 10:36.560
Martin.

10:37.920 --> 10:40.520
- They've already been here.
- Quiet, Patrick.

10:42.200 --> 10:43.240
Shut up.

10:56.280 --> 10:57.360
Patrick!

10:58.000 --> 11:00.120
What's he doing? He can't just...

11:03.160 --> 11:04.160
Patrick.

11:11.120 --> 11:13.440
What are you doing?
You can't just enter like that.

11:13.520 --> 11:14.520
Why not?

11:16.360 --> 11:17.360
Patrick.

11:19.760 --> 11:21.400
We have to get back right away.

11:30.560 --> 11:32.120
It's a family, Patrick.

11:32.200 --> 11:33.200
So?

11:33.480 --> 11:35.720
We can't eat their food.

11:35.800 --> 11:37.560
- Why not?
- They'll starve to death.

11:37.640 --> 11:39.560
- That's not my problem.
- What's up?

11:39.640 --> 11:41.480
- Of course it is.
- What's going on?

11:41.560 --> 11:43.320
- We can't eat their food?
- Why not?

11:43.400 --> 11:44.600
Children are living here.

11:44.680 --> 11:46.760
- There's nobody here.
- They may come back.

11:46.840 --> 11:49.920
Look, Patrick, drawings.

11:53.000 --> 11:54.560
Come. Let's take a look around.

12:00.040 --> 12:03.000
- So now you're also getting plastered.
- Why not?

12:05.160 --> 12:08.680
In the meantime, you guys can figure out
if we should starve to death or not.

12:15.200 --> 12:16.720
Fucking bunkers.

12:21.600 --> 12:24.440
- Got two seconds?
- Sure.

12:25.080 --> 12:26.760
No need to hide it.

12:27.160 --> 12:28.880
I was young once, too. Come with me.

12:29.440 --> 12:30.440
Okay.

12:40.880 --> 12:41.880
It's yours.

12:43.280 --> 12:44.320
Seriously?

12:45.600 --> 12:48.120
- Shit!
- Nice, isn't it?

12:48.200 --> 12:50.120
- Now you can go anywhere you want.
- Yeah.

12:51.200 --> 12:52.080
Far away.

12:52.160 --> 12:53.160
Sure.

12:53.360 --> 12:56.240
- I'm gonna cruise Europe in this.
- And don't come back.

13:03.640 --> 13:04.640
Look.

13:05.600 --> 13:06.440
Take a look.

13:06.520 --> 13:07.960
- What?
- The teddy bear.

13:09.880 --> 13:11.600
A child would never leave that behind.

13:41.000 --> 13:42.520
There's something wrong here.

13:52.960 --> 13:54.320
<i>Leave me go!</i>

13:55.680 --> 13:56.680
<i>Let go!</i>

13:58.240 --> 13:59.240
<i>Leave me go!</i>

14:03.360 --> 14:06.120
Patrick... pack up. We have to move on.

14:07.240 --> 14:08.240
Lea?

14:10.520 --> 14:13.400
Take what we need and leave some behind
in case they come back.

14:13.480 --> 14:15.360
- Don't count on it.
- What?

14:15.960 --> 14:21.880
<i>Test subject 451, male, fit, 37 years old,
injected with 20 ml...</i>

14:21.960 --> 14:22.800
<i>What's going on?</i>

14:22.880 --> 14:25.560
<i>Sweetie, I told you
to wait in the bedroom.</i>

14:25.960 --> 14:27.720
<i>Hello there. Where's your teddy bear?</i>

14:28.560 --> 14:31.320
<i>Is the teddy bear asleep in your bedroom?</i>

14:32.560 --> 14:35.120
<i>- I think it's awake.
- I can't hear it.</i>

14:35.200 --> 14:37.400
<i>No, I'm sure it's calling out your name.</i>

14:37.480 --> 14:39.880
<i>Go on, you better check on him.
I think he's hungry.</i>

14:42.640 --> 14:43.720
<i>Look over there.</i>

14:49.520 --> 14:52.320
<i>The patient is not showing
any immediate signs of illness.</i>

14:54.040 --> 14:55.480
<i>Give me a visual from your end.</i>

14:56.400 --> 14:57.400
<i>What's going on?</i>

14:57.440 --> 14:58.440
<i>I see you.</i>

14:59.600 --> 15:00.840
<i>Is he immune?</i>

15:01.560 --> 15:03.640
<i>Well, he doesn't have any symptoms.</i>

15:04.760 --> 15:06.240
<i>No, wait. They're starting.</i>

15:10.400 --> 15:12.320
<i>- Dad?
- Are there other subjects?</i>

15:12.400 --> 15:16.000
<i>- Dad!
- Yes, a girl. Eight years old.</i>

15:16.080 --> 15:17.880
<i>Are there any more shots left?</i>

15:19.760 --> 15:21.080
<i>Yeah, but...</i>

15:21.400 --> 15:22.480
<i>Proceed.</i>

15:24.080 --> 15:25.440
<i>Copy that.</i>

15:25.840 --> 15:26.920
<i>Don't!</i>

15:27.560 --> 15:28.560
<i>Let go!</i>

15:28.960 --> 15:29.800
<i>Dad!</i>

15:29.880 --> 15:33.080
There are hundreds of videos
like this one. If we stay, we'll be next.

15:33.160 --> 15:35.160
We won't, 'cause we're leaving now.

15:35.240 --> 15:36.600
Yes, straight to Apollon.

15:36.680 --> 15:39.920
- They're looking for a cure.
- They're injecting people with the virus.

15:40.000 --> 15:42.720
They're looking for a cure.
That's why they're injecting it.

15:42.800 --> 15:45.560
- He said it's for immunity.
- I see a man killing a man.

15:45.640 --> 15:48.840
- And the girl?
- I don't want to talk about it.

15:48.920 --> 15:50.840
Did they lure her in here
with a lollipop?

15:50.920 --> 15:52.320
- Shut up!
- Hey!

15:52.800 --> 15:55.280
Go get ready.
We need to get out of here now.

15:58.360 --> 16:01.160
Martin, why are they doing it this way?

16:01.240 --> 16:02.280
I don't know.

16:02.360 --> 16:03.800
Why this way?

16:03.880 --> 16:06.200
Hey... it's got nothing to do with you.

16:07.960 --> 16:08.960
Okay?

16:23.920 --> 16:24.920
Let's go.

16:32.520 --> 16:34.000
Does everybody have their stuff?

16:37.840 --> 16:38.840
Fuck!

16:45.440 --> 16:46.560
We can't stay here.

16:48.200 --> 16:50.480
- We have to.
- What if the Strangers come here?

16:51.040 --> 16:53.080
Or the injection-happy psychos return?

16:53.160 --> 16:55.680
As long as it's raining, no one's coming.

16:55.760 --> 16:57.920
Why don't you take it easy
with that stuff?

16:58.000 --> 16:59.120
What?

16:59.200 --> 17:00.320
I'll stand guard.

17:03.200 --> 17:05.480
- Want me to stay?
- No, I don't.

17:10.480 --> 17:13.400
It's so unfair that the disease
doesn't kill animals.

17:13.480 --> 17:15.520
Yeah, and that they can
pass the disease on.

17:24.280 --> 17:25.280
What's up?

17:25.319 --> 17:26.400
Are you okay?

17:26.480 --> 17:27.480
You're shaking.

17:29.280 --> 17:30.280
It's nothing.

17:33.240 --> 17:34.520
It's those pills.

17:34.600 --> 17:36.080
They're just painkillers.

17:44.560 --> 17:46.480
Actually, I think about them all the time.

17:49.960 --> 17:51.440
Think about something else.

17:54.840 --> 17:56.640
Why did you want to stay here with me?

18:12.440 --> 18:13.680
Are you spying on me?

18:15.880 --> 18:17.600
- Are you upset about something?
- No.

18:22.200 --> 18:23.200
Not fast enough.

18:23.680 --> 18:25.880
You seem a bit upset.

18:26.320 --> 18:27.320
Really?

18:31.160 --> 18:32.160
Can I have a sip?

18:41.720 --> 18:42.880
Fuck, that's gross.

18:43.520 --> 18:45.040
You're not supposed to taste it.

18:45.120 --> 18:48.840
Who puts caraway in anything?
Damn, that was gross.

18:52.920 --> 18:54.360
Come on, Gurgle Frantz.

18:54.440 --> 18:56.720
It's the World Championship Final.

18:56.800 --> 19:00.440
It's Patrick. It's Martin,
possibly the best goalie in the world...

19:00.960 --> 19:03.360
for penalty shoot-outs.

19:04.000 --> 19:07.080
- Go on, shoot, man.
- You said you weren't my friend.

19:09.800 --> 19:12.640
- This morning... by the lake.
- What?

19:12.720 --> 19:14.200
You don't even remember.

19:14.280 --> 19:17.760
Listen, if I said that,
that's not what I meant.

19:17.840 --> 19:19.360
That's exactly what you said.

20:38.560 --> 20:39.920
Do you want a sip?

20:41.040 --> 20:43.560
No... thanks.

20:44.880 --> 20:47.280
Weren't you better off in the bunker?

20:49.400 --> 20:51.000
What the hell do you mean, Patrick?

20:51.440 --> 20:52.840
You were all right.

20:52.920 --> 20:55.200
I was scared out of my mind
the whole time.

20:56.200 --> 20:59.040
What about now? Aren't you scared now?

20:59.120 --> 21:01.920
- Not in the same way.
- Well, you've got each other.

21:02.960 --> 21:03.960
What do you mean?

21:04.800 --> 21:06.000
You and Rasmus...

21:07.080 --> 21:09.320
and you and Martin,
and Beatrice and Rasmus,

21:09.400 --> 21:10.960
and Beatrice and Martin,

21:11.040 --> 21:12.200
and Lea and God.

21:12.280 --> 21:14.520
Hey, stop it. We've got you, too.

21:17.800 --> 21:19.200
Not in the same way.

21:46.400 --> 21:48.720
Come on, I'll teach you.

22:02.640 --> 22:05.680
Right... left.

22:09.320 --> 22:10.440
See, you can do it.

22:20.760 --> 22:23.960
Do you think things are like before
on the other side?

22:25.040 --> 22:26.040
I hope so.

22:29.680 --> 22:31.040
I was a nobody before.

22:32.640 --> 22:34.160
I was worth fucking nothing.

22:34.640 --> 22:37.000
Hey, watch out for the rain.

22:37.080 --> 22:39.960
Listen, you're somebody now, Patrick.

22:40.320 --> 22:42.000
We have to stick together.

22:42.920 --> 22:45.320
- No one should be alone.
- No.

22:46.520 --> 22:47.520
Right.

22:47.920 --> 22:49.440
Have you ever had sex?

22:51.240 --> 22:52.920
Would you like to?

22:54.040 --> 22:55.360
- Now?
- Yes.

23:21.520 --> 23:23.840
Patrick, what are you doing?

23:24.480 --> 23:25.600
What are you doing?

23:26.720 --> 23:27.960
You're looking at me and...

23:28.720 --> 23:30.280
- Cut it out.
- Drop it.

23:30.480 --> 23:33.160
- Don't touch me. Stop tugging at me.
- Let's just go inside.

23:33.240 --> 23:34.480
You don't know me, okay?

23:34.560 --> 23:36.480
- No, but you're drunk.
- Get off me.

23:41.800 --> 23:42.800
Martin!

23:44.960 --> 23:47.360
The rifle, Martin! Come quick!

23:55.040 --> 23:56.120
I don't want to...

24:06.360 --> 24:08.480
Beatrice, maybe nothing will happen.

24:09.040 --> 24:10.160
It hardly touched you.

24:10.240 --> 24:13.760
Yes, it did. I don't want to...

24:22.560 --> 24:24.040
Then we'll die together.

24:35.800 --> 24:37.840
- She was standing there when I came out!
- No.

24:37.920 --> 24:39.160
You have to shoot her!

24:41.200 --> 24:44.280
Just shoot her, goddamn it!
Come on, do it!

24:44.360 --> 24:46.200
No, Martin! Don't do it!

24:46.280 --> 24:48.240
- Shoot her!
- You can't shoot her!

24:49.080 --> 24:50.080
Martin!

24:51.520 --> 24:52.640
Shoot her!

24:54.480 --> 24:55.680
- Do it!
- Shut up!

24:55.760 --> 24:57.480
- Shoot her now!
- Don't do it.

25:00.440 --> 25:02.200
- Don't shoot.
- Get out of the way.

25:02.280 --> 25:03.280
Move.

25:03.640 --> 25:04.640
Don't shoot.

25:07.880 --> 25:10.000
We don't really know
if the rain is dangerous.

25:10.080 --> 25:11.640
What are you talking about?!

25:11.720 --> 25:13.120
Why don't you just shoot her?!

25:13.200 --> 25:15.240
- Don't shoot.
- Lea, come back!

25:15.800 --> 25:17.800
- Don't you go out there, too!
- Lea!

25:17.880 --> 25:19.360
- Get out of there.
- Don't shoot.

25:19.440 --> 25:20.440
Lea!

25:21.080 --> 25:21.920
- Lea!
- Lea!

25:22.000 --> 25:22.920
- Don't shoot.
- Lea!

25:23.000 --> 25:25.960
- No!
- No, Lea!

25:26.040 --> 25:27.040
Lea!

25:27.440 --> 25:28.440
Don't shoot.

25:28.720 --> 25:29.720
Lea!

25:31.440 --> 25:34.240
Shoot them both.

25:34.320 --> 25:36.400
- Don't be afraid. Don't.
- Shoot them...

25:36.480 --> 25:37.480
Shut up!

25:38.080 --> 25:39.080
No.

25:39.840 --> 25:43.320
- I'll fucking do it!
- Shut the fuck up, man!

25:43.880 --> 25:45.800
Move and shut up!

26:43.920 --> 26:45.760
What do you think they're talking about?

26:55.320 --> 26:57.560
About how you wanted me to shoot them.

27:00.640 --> 27:02.120
They're gonna die anyway.

27:04.960 --> 27:07.600
- I should've gone out to her in the rain.
- Why?

27:07.680 --> 27:09.560
I should've gone out to her in the rain.

27:19.760 --> 27:23.240
What do you think it looks like
on the other side of the wall?

27:25.400 --> 27:30.560
Maybe there's a house where someone
used to live. With a small garden.

27:31.240 --> 27:34.280
And then suddenly,
one day there was this huge wall.

27:34.840 --> 27:36.160
Right in their garden.

27:38.240 --> 27:39.800
That's got to be annoying.

27:40.520 --> 27:43.360
"Who put up a wall in my flowerbed?"

27:48.480 --> 27:50.320
I'm so happy you're here...

27:52.520 --> 27:54.600
or I'd be alone with those two.

27:55.920 --> 27:56.960
That would suck.

28:00.040 --> 28:01.040
You know?

28:03.680 --> 28:04.680
Lea?

28:06.320 --> 28:10.080
- Why did you come out to me in the rain?
- It was the right thing to do.

28:14.560 --> 28:16.480
I just want to see Rasmus again.

28:22.040 --> 28:23.040
Are you scared?

28:23.640 --> 28:24.640
Yes.

28:25.840 --> 28:28.880
- I really wish I'd met you sooner.
- Me too.

28:33.640 --> 28:35.120
Please sing me a lullaby.

28:38.480 --> 28:39.480
Sure.

29:05.720 --> 29:08.280
- How long has it been now?
- I don't know.

29:09.040 --> 29:10.760
But we can't wait any longer.

29:12.720 --> 29:15.800
- It doesn't make any sense.
- What?

29:23.960 --> 29:24.960
What happened?

29:26.720 --> 29:28.040
What happened?

29:28.760 --> 29:31.480
Why did you go out in the rain?
What happened?

29:32.240 --> 29:33.240
What happened?

29:39.840 --> 29:41.920
- What if nothing happens?
- What?

29:42.000 --> 29:45.040
What if they don't actually die?
What if...?

29:45.880 --> 29:47.240
What if the rain is harmless?

29:47.320 --> 29:49.640
We've been running from the rain
for six years now.

29:49.720 --> 29:51.640
- But we don't actually know, do we?
- No.

29:51.720 --> 29:54.720
- Then they shouldn't be in there.
- But they're infected, Martin!

29:54.800 --> 29:55.880
Get off me!

29:55.960 --> 29:57.600
Listen to me!

29:59.760 --> 30:00.760
I did it.

30:01.600 --> 30:02.600
Okay?

30:06.040 --> 30:07.040
I pushed her.

30:15.840 --> 30:16.840
What now?

30:19.440 --> 30:20.440
Come on.

30:25.720 --> 30:26.720
Martin?

30:52.840 --> 30:53.840
Martin.

30:57.800 --> 30:59.680
No!

31:01.800 --> 31:02.800
Martin.

31:15.480 --> 31:18.040
I don't get it!

32:23.880 --> 32:26.800
So, what can I get you?
Something to drink? Coming right up.

32:29.240 --> 32:30.240
There you go.

32:34.640 --> 32:36.640
Look...

32:43.840 --> 32:46.520
It's these bunkers, I don't like them.

32:46.880 --> 32:49.720
Oh, I see. Okay, okay.

32:50.520 --> 32:53.880
It's the bunker that made you sick.
Maybe you should sleep then.

32:53.960 --> 32:56.640
Because the bunker hangover
is right around the corner.

33:03.000 --> 33:04.000
Hi.

33:06.200 --> 33:08.560
Look the other way. I smell of puke.

33:08.640 --> 33:09.640
No, that's okay.

33:10.120 --> 33:11.240
It was my dad.

33:11.680 --> 33:17.400
The guy that called the scientist,
the other voice, that was my dad.

33:18.280 --> 33:19.280
Okay.

33:22.800 --> 33:24.000
We shouldn't go there.

33:24.760 --> 33:26.960
- Yes. No.
- No, we shouldn't go there.

33:28.720 --> 33:32.000
- He was supposed to save us.
- Simone, tomorrow, okay?

33:32.440 --> 33:33.720
Socks off.

33:37.320 --> 33:42.200
- Go away.
- But we have to swap places.

33:45.280 --> 33:46.280
Oh, now...

33:52.720 --> 33:54.400
- Good night.
- Sleep tight.

33:54.480 --> 33:55.520
See you tomorrow.

34:06.840 --> 34:07.840
What's up?

34:09.280 --> 34:10.320
Pack your stuff.

34:11.440 --> 34:12.440
Are we leaving?

34:13.480 --> 34:14.520
Yes.

34:14.600 --> 34:15.639
Sure.

34:38.120 --> 34:39.120
Where's your stuff?

34:42.040 --> 34:43.040
Go.

34:43.639 --> 34:45.040
What are you talking about?

34:46.880 --> 34:50.040
Listen... you tried to kill her.

34:50.120 --> 34:51.440
But, Martin...

34:54.800 --> 34:55.800
Martin?

35:03.840 --> 35:04.840
Martin.

35:07.560 --> 35:08.560
Martin.

35:12.400 --> 35:13.680
Martin!

35:53.840 --> 35:54.920
I think it's dead.

35:57.600 --> 35:59.320
Why are you pointing that thing at me?

36:00.120 --> 36:02.120
Why are you driving that crap car?

36:11.160 --> 36:13.840
- Can I borrow a light?
- And you won't shoot me?

36:16.920 --> 36:18.000
Here you go.

36:41.400 --> 36:43.760
I haven't smoked in ages.

36:44.520 --> 36:47.560
It's impossible to find
a damn lighter anywhere.

36:47.640 --> 36:50.120
Keep that one. I always carry two.

36:52.520 --> 36:54.280
Good thing I met you then.

36:56.920 --> 36:58.840
- Did I say something funny?
- No.

36:59.440 --> 37:01.880
It's just that no one
ever said that to me before.

37:19.240 --> 37:20.240
Beatrice, we made it.

37:21.440 --> 37:24.000
Hey! Get out!

37:24.080 --> 37:26.280
Out! Get out!

37:35.280 --> 37:36.600
Good morning.

37:38.440 --> 37:39.440
Beatrice.

37:45.680 --> 37:46.760
Beatrice?

37:50.480 --> 37:51.480
Beatri...

37:52.240 --> 37:53.440
Come on!

37:57.600 --> 37:58.960
Beatrice!

38:02.320 --> 38:03.320
No.

38:06.600 --> 38:07.880
Wake up!

38:35.520 --> 38:38.040
- Hey.
- She's not breathing.

38:40.360 --> 38:41.360
Stay back!

38:43.120 --> 38:45.440
- I don't want to get infected.
- Help me!

38:45.520 --> 38:47.440
Patrick!

38:53.920 --> 38:55.560
Patrick!

38:57.480 --> 39:00.280
Come back! Patrick!
