Previously on
<i>warehouse 13...</i>

00:02.597 --> 00:04.498
Apparently Martino
and your partner

00:04.499 --> 00:06.451
were having an affair,
and he was married.

00:06.452 --> 00:08.420
I read the press release
of what went down in Denver.

00:08.488 --> 00:11.271
Lives were saved.
Lives were lost.

00:11.339 --> 00:12.730
Hey, Bunny.

00:12.798 --> 00:14.949
You're dead, Sam.

00:15.017 --> 00:16.277
I was late.

00:16.346 --> 00:18.895
No, Bunny.
I was early.

00:18.963 --> 00:23.093
Myka, the only person
responsible for Sam's death

00:23.160 --> 00:26.725
is the piece of garbage that
pulled the trigger that day.

00:29.789 --> 00:31.052
Security, 11:00.

00:32.951 --> 00:34.781
Copy that, Chloe.

00:36.246 --> 00:37.645
And clear.

00:37.713 --> 00:39.248
Okay, listen, be ready,

00:39.315 --> 00:41.047
'cause he's gonna loop around
again in 12 minutes.

00:41.115 --> 00:43.017
I'll only need four.

00:47.221 --> 00:49.858
Well, Artie was right.

00:49.926 --> 00:51.759
The plaque was just
covering up a hole

00:51.827 --> 00:53.226
with a bunch
of junk in it.

00:53.293 --> 00:54.728
Civic buildings used
to honor their workers

00:54.795 --> 00:56.363
by burying their tools.

00:56.430 --> 00:58.698
Yeah, well, I bet they'd
have preferred a proper wage

00:58.765 --> 01:00.766
for tunneling through
the Rockies with a pickaxe.

01:00.834 --> 01:02.100
Do you see the spike?

01:04.837 --> 01:07.872
There's a bunch
of them in here.

01:07.940 --> 01:10.241
Pete, wait.

01:10.309 --> 01:11.575
Pfft.

01:11.642 --> 01:12.742
What?

01:12.810 --> 01:14.509
No glove, no love, man.

01:14.577 --> 01:17.443
What would I do without
my super-cautious partner?

01:25.780 --> 01:26.913
Can't be.

01:30.682 --> 01:32.515
Oh, my God.

01:33.816 --> 01:36.085
Sam?

01:36.152 --> 01:37.819
Sam, wait!

01:39.788 --> 01:41.222
Sam!

01:48.330 --> 01:49.930
Pete, are you gonna be okay?

01:49.998 --> 01:51.232
I have to go check
on something.

01:51.300 --> 01:52.699
I'm good. Go.

02:28.962 --> 02:30.329
Oh, sorry.

02:30.396 --> 02:31.964
Ah!

02:43.540 --> 02:46.307
Myka, one of the spikes
cut my glove.

02:46.375 --> 02:48.109
I almost got him.

02:48.177 --> 02:49.777
I--

02:51.446 --> 02:54.313
Myka, something's happening.

02:56.382 --> 02:57.850
Myka, help me.

02:59.753 --> 03:00.919
Pete!

03:02.922 --> 03:05.124
Pete, what's happening?
Talk to me?

03:21.772 --> 03:23.606
Are you okay?

03:27.076 --> 03:28.576
It's like having breakfast

03:28.644 --> 03:30.278
with my Aunt Jude
and Uncle Pall Mall.

03:34.048 --> 03:35.315
Are you okay?

03:35.383 --> 03:37.417
I almost had him, Pete.

03:37.484 --> 03:39.419
What?
Had who?

03:39.486 --> 03:42.088
Leo.

03:42.155 --> 03:43.389
Who's Leo?

03:43.457 --> 03:46.425
The guy who shot my partner.

03:48.228 --> 03:50.663
He's the guy who killed Sam.

I just can't get over it.

04:07.113 --> 04:09.680
Handsome boy like you
not married.

04:09.748 --> 04:10.948
He's very picky.

04:11.016 --> 04:13.116
The collection's
over here.

04:13.184 --> 04:17.053
So what made your great Uncle
collect doorknobs?

04:17.120 --> 04:18.255
O.C.D.

04:18.322 --> 04:19.790
Back then we didn't
have Prozac,

04:19.858 --> 04:22.159
so we just called it a hobby
and looked the other way.

04:22.227 --> 04:25.361
Well, one of these doorknobs
might be worth something now.

04:25.429 --> 04:26.596
Fingers crossed.

04:26.664 --> 04:28.832
Now, I checked my <i>TV Times.</i>

04:28.899 --> 04:32.435
I couldn't find anything
called <i>The Artifact Roadshow.</i>

04:32.503 --> 04:35.572
Mrs. Hodgson,
can I bother you

04:35.640 --> 04:37.007
for a glass
of something cold?

04:37.074 --> 04:38.375
Where's my head today?

04:38.442 --> 04:40.410
I made iced tea

04:40.478 --> 04:42.012
and left it downstairs.

04:42.079 --> 04:43.546
I'll go get it.

04:43.614 --> 04:46.216
I'll get my niece's
email address.

04:46.284 --> 04:48.284
She's single too.

04:48.352 --> 04:49.986
Okay.

04:53.992 --> 04:55.192
What do you bet
great-Uncle doorknob

04:55.259 --> 04:56.960
never got married either?
Yeah.

04:57.028 --> 04:59.095
One of these things
is not like the other.

04:59.163 --> 05:00.597
I don't suppose
it'll just say

05:00.665 --> 05:02.866
"Triangle Shirtwaist Factory"
on it.

05:02.934 --> 05:05.268
Yeah, 146 women
die in a sweatshop fire.

05:05.336 --> 05:06.937
That's a hell of a way
to create an artifact.

05:07.004 --> 05:08.505
Yeah, they were locked in

05:08.573 --> 05:09.806
so they couldn't
leave work early.

05:09.874 --> 05:10.940
As they tried to escape,

05:11.008 --> 05:12.509
the doorknob
absorbed their pain

05:12.577 --> 05:13.977
and suffering.

05:14.045 --> 05:16.080
Did Artie give you an actual
physical description?

05:16.147 --> 05:18.115
Doorknob.

05:18.183 --> 05:19.450
Right.

05:19.518 --> 05:22.620
Guess we just
dump all these out,

05:22.688 --> 05:24.890
drop 'em each in a bag,
and see which one--

05:24.957 --> 05:27.393
Ahh!

05:27.460 --> 05:30.330
Oh, is everything okay?

05:33.100 --> 05:35.101
Much better now.
Thank you.

05:35.169 --> 05:39.872
- Is that peach?
- Thank you.

05:39.940 --> 05:41.407
But I was wearing
purple gloves.

05:41.475 --> 05:42.675
Yeah, see, the thing is
artifact snagging

05:42.743 --> 05:44.176
is not an exact science.

05:44.244 --> 05:45.477
So can I drive the Prius back?

05:45.545 --> 05:46.779
Please, please, please.
Thanks.

05:46.846 --> 05:48.513
You might consider
buying one of your own.

05:48.581 --> 05:49.914
As soon as I can get Artie
to quit paying me

05:49.982 --> 05:51.749
in bright orange $500 bills.

05:51.817 --> 05:53.417
Okay?

05:53.485 --> 05:55.019
Hey, cute.

05:55.087 --> 05:57.455
Oh.
What a sweetheart.

05:57.523 --> 05:58.957
Where'd you come from?

05:59.025 --> 06:01.059
Hmm, she doesn't
have a dog.

06:01.127 --> 06:02.995
Agh.

06:03.063 --> 06:05.731
Steve?

06:07.334 --> 06:08.334
Ah.

06:18.779 --> 06:20.446
Three years ago,
Leo Bock stole plates

06:20.513 --> 06:21.613
from the Denver Mint.

06:21.681 --> 06:23.048
Later as we were
setting a trap for him

06:23.115 --> 06:25.016
he gunned down Sam
in the National Building.

06:25.084 --> 06:27.118
But I know that
I saw him today.

06:27.185 --> 06:29.553
Here you go.

06:29.621 --> 06:31.054
I've cued it up
to 9:00 a.m.

06:33.758 --> 06:35.759
Come on, Leo.
Show your face.

06:35.827 --> 06:37.094
We should check
credit card purchases

06:37.162 --> 06:38.996
for trains arriving
around 9:00.

06:39.064 --> 06:40.664
No, no, Leo's
a master counterfeiter.

06:40.732 --> 06:42.166
He tosses off identities

06:42.234 --> 06:44.502
the way that
a cook breaks eggs.

06:44.570 --> 06:46.371
There.

06:46.439 --> 06:47.706
That's him.

06:47.773 --> 06:48.807
What camera is that?

06:48.875 --> 06:52.345
The northeast exit.

06:52.412 --> 06:54.447
Pete, let's go.

06:54.515 --> 06:56.716
So he left
20 minutes ago.

06:56.784 --> 06:59.852
He--he took a taxi.

06:59.920 --> 07:02.488
Or no, a bus.

07:02.556 --> 07:04.256
Where does that leave us?

07:04.324 --> 07:06.659
Look, Myka, he came
to Denver for a reason.

07:06.726 --> 07:08.293
We'll track him down.

07:08.361 --> 07:11.463
I chased Leo harder than
I've ever chased anyone, okay?

07:11.530 --> 07:14.666
I studied him.
I knew everything about him.

07:14.733 --> 07:16.234
He drinks gin and tonics
with two limes,

07:16.302 --> 07:18.469
he bats lefty,
he has no gallbladder,

07:18.537 --> 07:20.238
and he has
a dairy allergy.

07:20.306 --> 07:21.540
None of it paid off.

07:21.608 --> 07:23.642
And now he's gone again.

07:23.710 --> 07:27.013
I think we should contact
Denver Secret Service.

07:27.081 --> 07:29.649
My old team?

07:29.717 --> 07:31.485
Yeah, well,
it's their case, right?

07:31.552 --> 07:33.520
You know, I haven't
been in touch with them

07:33.588 --> 07:35.189
since I transferred to D.C.

07:35.256 --> 07:37.358
And then Mrs. Frederic asked
me to join the warehouse.

07:37.426 --> 07:38.826
Right, where you've been
saving the world

07:38.894 --> 07:41.295
over and over and over again.

07:41.363 --> 07:45.366
But I couldn't save Sam,
and I couldn't catch Leo.

07:45.434 --> 07:47.535
And if I were my team,

07:47.603 --> 07:50.571
I'd have a hard time
forgiving me.

08:05.977 --> 08:07.845
Hey.

08:07.912 --> 08:09.413
Claudia, hey, wake up.

08:09.481 --> 08:10.581
Jinksy?

08:10.648 --> 08:12.650
Oh, God,
what the hell happened?

08:12.717 --> 08:14.518
This time we got snagged
and tagged.

08:14.586 --> 08:16.187
And de-bagged.

08:16.254 --> 08:18.423
The doorknob is gone.
Somebody must have followed us.

08:18.490 --> 08:19.691
Hey, wait a minute.
I saw a car.

08:19.758 --> 08:21.626
What kind?

08:21.694 --> 08:25.029
It was silvery bluey.
Ugh, that's all I got.

08:25.097 --> 08:26.431
Looks like
they drove closer.

08:26.498 --> 08:27.765
These tracks are fresh.

08:27.833 --> 08:29.533
I'll call Artie.

08:29.601 --> 08:30.434
Shh, you!

08:30.502 --> 08:31.836
You called me.

08:31.904 --> 08:33.871
Artie, somebody
knocked us out,

08:33.938 --> 08:35.539
grabbed the doorknob,
and zoomed off in a car.

08:35.607 --> 08:37.375
Code red or blue, whatever
the worst color would be.

08:37.443 --> 08:38.977
All right,
take a deep breath.

08:39.044 --> 08:40.611
Were there any witnesses?

08:40.679 --> 08:42.047
Not in the middle-of-nowhere
Wisconsin.

08:43.216 --> 08:44.516
Hey, hey, hey.
Easy, fella.

08:44.584 --> 08:47.185
Was the dog there
when you were attacked?

08:47.253 --> 08:49.187
Oh, you think
the dog did it?

08:49.255 --> 08:50.555
Don't be absurd,

08:50.623 --> 08:53.225
but what do dogs do
when a car zooms off?

08:53.293 --> 08:54.593
They chase them?

08:54.661 --> 08:57.063
Yes, and what do cars have
on their back bumpers?

08:57.130 --> 08:58.297
License plates.

08:58.365 --> 08:59.799
So maybe the dog saw
the license plate

08:59.867 --> 09:01.567
and he can tell us--and that's
where this all falls apart.

09:01.635 --> 09:03.269
Just come back

09:03.337 --> 09:05.038
and bring the dog.

09:06.840 --> 09:09.075
Oh, and I'm being absurd?

09:09.143 --> 09:10.143
Ah.

09:40.106 --> 09:41.339
Here.

09:41.407 --> 09:43.708
Let me.

09:43.776 --> 09:46.110
So you're going in
early today.

09:46.178 --> 09:47.311
Yeah, well,
I think it's best

09:47.379 --> 09:48.779
if we don't show up
together.

09:48.847 --> 09:50.247
Why, you think
people know?

09:50.315 --> 09:52.149
Do--

09:52.216 --> 09:54.317
we work with agents
trained to detect

09:54.385 --> 09:56.119
minute behavioral cues.

09:56.186 --> 09:57.587
So do I think that
our coworkers notice

09:57.655 --> 09:58.988
that every time I look at you

09:59.056 --> 10:01.023
I want you in every way
imaginable?

10:01.091 --> 10:03.359
Yeah, I think they know.
Sorry.

10:03.426 --> 10:05.761
Don't apologize.

10:08.533 --> 10:09.901
I like that look.

10:09.969 --> 10:12.303
There it is now.

10:19.876 --> 10:21.710
Oh, you're killing me.

10:21.778 --> 10:22.878
Good.

10:22.946 --> 10:25.680
I have to go to work.

10:25.748 --> 10:27.949
So do you.

10:28.017 --> 10:29.851
All work and no play...

10:33.822 --> 10:36.090
Stay focused, Slim.
Eyes and ears open.

10:42.097 --> 10:44.064
He was really young, huh?

10:44.132 --> 10:46.033
Last guy you thought
would fall.

10:46.100 --> 10:47.434
He was an impeccable Agent,

10:47.502 --> 10:50.537
and his backup plans
had backup plans.

10:50.605 --> 10:52.673
You know, Pete,
before we go in there,

10:52.741 --> 10:54.341
I've got to tell you
something.

10:54.409 --> 10:56.410
I think I already know.

10:56.478 --> 10:58.380
That FBI Agent Bonnie Belski

10:58.447 --> 10:59.982
told me that
Sam was married

11:00.049 --> 11:01.850
when you guys
were together.

11:01.918 --> 11:04.119
Well, obviously Belski
didn't know the whole story.

11:04.187 --> 11:07.223
Sam had been separated from
his wife for a year

11:07.291 --> 11:09.893
before we even--

11:09.961 --> 11:12.063
- Myka Bering.
- Zach.

11:12.130 --> 11:13.564
Couldn't believe it when
I heard you were coming in.

11:13.632 --> 11:14.866
How are you?

11:14.933 --> 11:16.868
Good, good.
God, it's nice to see you.

11:16.936 --> 11:18.904
How's South Dakota
Secret Service treating you?

11:18.972 --> 11:21.273
And what the hell is there
to do in South Dakota?

11:21.341 --> 11:23.542
Well, hey, now,
you'd be surprised.

11:23.610 --> 11:25.978
Guarding those
Mount Rushmore Presidents,

11:26.046 --> 11:27.346
a lot more challenging
than you'd think.

11:27.414 --> 11:29.549
This is my partner,
Pete Lattimer.

11:29.617 --> 11:30.917
This is Zach.

11:30.984 --> 11:32.285
He's an investigator
here in Denver.

11:32.353 --> 11:35.588
Actually, I'm director
of investigations now.

11:35.655 --> 11:37.256
Really?

11:37.324 --> 11:39.192
That was gonna be--

11:39.259 --> 11:41.360
Sam's job, I know.

11:41.428 --> 11:43.362
I try to live up
to his standards.

11:43.430 --> 11:47.733
Well, come on back.

11:47.801 --> 11:48.901
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

11:48.969 --> 11:50.135
Thank you so much.
I appreciate it.

11:50.203 --> 11:51.570
So Leo came by train?

11:51.638 --> 11:53.071
And changed his appearance.

11:53.139 --> 11:54.372
He shaved his facial hair

11:54.440 --> 11:56.274
and shot filler
into his chin.

11:56.341 --> 11:59.043
But if you look
at these eight focal points,

11:59.111 --> 12:03.079
there's a 97% match
to Leo Bock.

12:03.147 --> 12:04.748
Okay, so I guess
the real question here

12:04.816 --> 12:06.583
is why is Leo back in Denver?

12:06.651 --> 12:08.252
Some murders get off

12:08.319 --> 12:09.587
on returning
to the scene of the crime.

12:09.654 --> 12:11.522
Well, it doesn't fit
Leo's profile.

12:11.590 --> 12:13.490
He's white-collar
all the way.

12:13.558 --> 12:15.693
His only violent crime
was killing Sam.

12:15.760 --> 12:18.062
And this is
the first time

12:18.130 --> 12:20.130
I've seen him
not wearing a suit.

12:20.198 --> 12:22.432
He could be going back
to the mint, right?

12:22.500 --> 12:24.467
Three years later,
new Secretary of Treasury.

12:24.535 --> 12:26.236
Maybe he needs
a new set of plates.

12:26.303 --> 12:27.470
Well, you just
can't walk into the mint.

12:27.538 --> 12:28.871
Wait.

12:28.939 --> 12:30.606
Yes, you can.

12:30.674 --> 12:33.608
Yes, you can.
Look at what Leo's wearing.

12:33.676 --> 12:35.744
The mile high city T-shirt,

12:35.812 --> 12:37.112
the Rocky Mountain
football cap, the jeans.

12:37.180 --> 12:39.380
I mean, guys, come on,
who dresses that way?

12:39.448 --> 12:41.348
- Tourists!
- Right.

12:41.416 --> 12:42.917
Okay, that's why
he's not wearing a suit.

12:42.984 --> 12:44.718
Because he's trying
to blend in with the others.

12:44.786 --> 12:47.655
By taking a bus tour
of downtown Denver.

12:47.723 --> 12:51.425
Okay, the first bus leaves
from the northeast corner

12:51.493 --> 12:53.661
of the train station
at 9:10 a.m.

12:53.728 --> 12:55.595
First stop
is the state capitol,

12:55.663 --> 12:58.965
second stop is the art museum,
and the third stop is...

12:59.033 --> 12:59.999
the U.S. mint.

13:00.067 --> 13:02.102
Bus arrives in 20 minutes.

13:02.170 --> 13:03.536
Can we make it in time?

13:03.604 --> 13:05.639
It's a block away.

13:05.707 --> 13:07.507
Well, I'm not from Denver,
now am I?

13:10.445 --> 13:13.513
Okay, so the last thing that
I want is a hostage situation.

13:13.581 --> 13:15.416
So wait until Leo
gets off the bus

13:15.483 --> 13:17.084
before we grab him.

13:17.152 --> 13:18.319
I'll back you up
from the east.

13:18.387 --> 13:19.387
Zach, you got the west.

13:21.890 --> 13:23.090
Here it comes.

13:23.158 --> 13:24.392
Okay, boys,
just follow my lead.

13:24.459 --> 13:27.427
Eyes and ears open.

13:27.495 --> 13:29.362
Still impulsive
and emotional.

13:29.430 --> 13:31.164
- Classic Myka.
- What, classic who now?

13:31.232 --> 13:33.166
Hey, whoa--

13:38.138 --> 13:40.038
You okay?

13:40.106 --> 13:43.876
I will be when
we catch this bastard.

13:43.943 --> 13:45.210
You'll need it
for the mint.

13:45.278 --> 13:47.012
And as you can see,
you're gonna get a taste

13:47.080 --> 13:48.681
of our famous
Denver weather.

13:48.749 --> 13:50.617
Nice one second,
rain the next.

13:50.684 --> 13:53.286
All right, let's go.

13:53.354 --> 13:55.222
Pete, he's made us.

13:55.290 --> 13:56.323
Police, freeze!

13:56.391 --> 13:57.558
Oh, my God,
he's got a gun!

13:58.794 --> 13:59.727
Secret Service!
Move!

14:03.465 --> 14:04.465
Look out, look out!
Police!

14:09.804 --> 14:10.871
- Pete, there!
- Look out!

14:10.939 --> 14:13.542
Jim, he's coming your way.

14:16.513 --> 14:17.446
I'm okay.

14:25.054 --> 14:26.588
Damn it!

14:26.656 --> 14:28.691
What happened?
Where's Leo?

14:28.759 --> 14:30.559
Well, he came
down this alley.

14:30.627 --> 14:34.397
And then he just disappeared.

14:34.465 --> 14:35.765
He did it again.

14:37.936 --> 14:40.838
You let him get away?

14:40.906 --> 14:43.274
How could you?
How did you let that happen?

14:57.879 --> 14:58.979
Hang in there, man.

15:02.917 --> 15:04.951
Jim's got a hairline
rib fracture.

15:05.019 --> 15:08.187
The EMT says he'll be fine.

15:08.255 --> 15:10.890
Look, I know how frustrated
you must be,

15:10.957 --> 15:13.358
but don't take it out
on Pete, okay?

15:13.426 --> 15:17.629
We all want to put
this guy away.

15:17.697 --> 15:19.531
Thanks.

15:28.176 --> 15:31.245
I'm--I'm gonna--yeah.

15:34.583 --> 15:37.752
Pete, what are you doing?

15:37.820 --> 15:39.921
Well, I'm--I'm thinking
like Myka.

15:39.989 --> 15:43.391
Yeah, I mean, when something
doesn't make sense,

15:43.459 --> 15:44.626
Myka tries
to make sense of it.

15:44.693 --> 15:45.927
I mean, but not right now

15:45.995 --> 15:47.762
because she's too emotional,

15:47.829 --> 15:50.197
which is where
Pete usually is, emotional.

15:50.265 --> 15:51.565
But then I thought,
hey, while you're being me

15:51.632 --> 15:52.799
I might as well be you.

15:52.867 --> 15:54.701
So I've investigated
every way

15:54.769 --> 15:57.470
that Leo could have used
to escape a blind alley, right?

15:57.538 --> 15:59.973
Like hidden drain pipes
or manholes.

16:00.041 --> 16:01.141
And?

16:01.209 --> 16:02.943
Nothing,
but then I thought,

16:03.011 --> 16:05.046
what if Leo was able to jump
into the bed of the truck

16:05.114 --> 16:07.982
onto the roof
and up and over the wall?

16:08.050 --> 16:09.784
Well, that's quite
a maneuver.

16:09.852 --> 16:11.119
He had 50 yards on me,
right?

16:11.187 --> 16:12.921
Which is about
a seven-second lead.

16:12.989 --> 16:15.023
So how long does it take
to get over the wall?

16:15.091 --> 16:17.225
Well, that's what
I was trying out,

16:17.293 --> 16:19.794
but I could use some help.

16:19.862 --> 16:20.996
Okay.

16:22.198 --> 16:23.731
All right,
all right, all right.

16:23.799 --> 16:25.466
- Okay, first...
- Yes?

16:25.534 --> 16:27.902
We must synchronize
our watches

16:27.969 --> 16:29.603
to the exact second.
Okay, yeah.

16:29.671 --> 16:31.238
Ready and go.

16:31.305 --> 16:32.305
Yeah.

16:32.373 --> 16:33.473
Then we'll walk over here

16:33.541 --> 16:34.874
to where I last saw Leo.

16:34.942 --> 16:36.009
Uh-huh.

16:36.076 --> 16:37.210
At the top
of the next minute,

16:37.278 --> 16:38.411
I'll run.

16:38.478 --> 16:40.046
Seven seconds later,
you'll go.

16:40.114 --> 16:43.016
- Got it, I'll be you.
- Exactly.

16:43.084 --> 16:45.018
Go.

16:45.086 --> 16:46.152
Six, five...

16:49.956 --> 16:51.223
Time.

16:51.291 --> 16:52.691
Okay, okay.

16:52.759 --> 16:54.126
Let's try 12 seconds.

16:57.697 --> 16:59.298
Time.

17:00.467 --> 17:01.902
Time.

17:03.304 --> 17:04.805
Time.

17:07.709 --> 17:09.443
Time.

17:09.511 --> 17:10.611
See?

17:10.679 --> 17:11.980
It's impossible.

17:12.047 --> 17:13.580
So there's no explanation

17:13.648 --> 17:14.915
of how he got away?

17:14.983 --> 17:16.050
This is what I'm saying.

17:16.117 --> 17:17.417
Okay, look,

17:17.486 --> 17:21.454
when something has
no explanation--

17:21.522 --> 17:23.057
oh, my God.

17:23.124 --> 17:24.258
What?

17:24.325 --> 17:26.593
Well, don't you get it?

17:26.661 --> 17:28.661
Good, you're back
to being Myka.

17:28.729 --> 17:30.462
Now I shall go back
to being Pete.

17:30.530 --> 17:32.064
When something has
no explanation,

17:32.132 --> 17:33.732
there can only be
one explanation.

17:33.800 --> 17:35.134
Leo has an artifact?

17:35.202 --> 17:37.837
That's the only thing
that makes sense.

17:37.905 --> 17:39.439
I mean, he vanished
into thin air.

17:39.507 --> 17:40.574
We know that
they're out there, right?

17:40.641 --> 17:41.842
That we do.

17:41.910 --> 17:43.043
But I didn't know that
three years ago.

17:43.111 --> 17:44.244
So I didn't know
what I was looking for.

17:44.312 --> 17:45.846
Okay, you know what,

17:45.914 --> 17:47.181
I'm gonna go back
to Sam's office.

17:47.249 --> 17:49.250
I'm gonna look at his notes
on the old case.

17:49.318 --> 17:50.118
What, are you gonna
re-open it?

17:50.186 --> 17:51.219
Yes.

17:51.287 --> 17:52.520
But not as
a Secret Service Agent.

17:52.588 --> 17:54.690
As a Warehouse Agent.

17:54.758 --> 17:58.394
Yes!
The old Myka is back!

17:58.462 --> 18:00.896
Could be good,
could be bad.

18:00.964 --> 18:03.132
- You coming?
- Yeah.

18:06.703 --> 18:09.138
Somewhere around--

18:09.206 --> 18:10.706
yes!

18:10.774 --> 18:12.274
Perfect.
All right.

18:12.342 --> 18:13.876
Father and son Shriners.

18:13.944 --> 18:16.511
No, they belonged
to a depression-era

18:16.579 --> 18:18.914
mindreading act,
Mr. Mental and Coco.

18:18.981 --> 18:21.883
Real names Raymond Fraser
and Coco.

18:21.951 --> 18:24.352
Yes, now in the act

18:24.420 --> 18:25.854
Coco would scamper
into the audience

18:25.922 --> 18:29.023
and he would solicit items
like a monogrammed handkerchief

18:29.091 --> 18:31.126
or a dollar bill, something
with initials or numbers.

18:31.194 --> 18:32.560
Mr. Mental
would sit onstage,

18:32.628 --> 18:34.596
he'd be blindfolded,
he would read Coco's mind,

18:34.663 --> 18:37.065
he would recite back perfectly
the numbers or the initials.

18:37.133 --> 18:38.299
So let me guess,
the hats were imbued

18:38.367 --> 18:39.800
with the mystical juju of--

18:39.868 --> 18:41.034
No, not this time,

18:41.102 --> 18:43.136
because Mr. Mental
was an amateur inventor

18:43.204 --> 18:44.971
and he had a background
in neurology.

18:45.039 --> 18:46.472
Look.

18:46.540 --> 18:47.473
A transmitter.

18:47.540 --> 18:48.941
So the receiver would be--

18:49.008 --> 18:50.742
Yes.

18:50.810 --> 18:51.944
Huh, so he used
radio waves?

18:52.011 --> 18:53.645
Not quite.
Brain waves.

18:53.713 --> 18:56.081
Magnetic resonance.
Impressive.

18:56.149 --> 18:58.317
Mr. Mental made
the first MRI.

18:58.384 --> 19:00.453
There also may have been
the teensiest amount

19:00.520 --> 19:02.455
of mystical juju.
Wait, wait, wait,

19:02.523 --> 19:05.558
you're saying that he could
actually read Coco's thoughts?

19:05.626 --> 19:06.926
Well, nothing too complex,

19:06.994 --> 19:08.462
but simple images came
through loud and clear, yes.

19:08.529 --> 19:09.697
And we're gonna use these

19:09.764 --> 19:10.865
to get the license plate
from the dog?

19:10.933 --> 19:12.133
With any luck.

19:12.201 --> 19:13.234
But there's always
a downside, right?

19:13.302 --> 19:14.702
What's the downside?

19:14.770 --> 19:16.104
Not that bad.

19:16.171 --> 19:17.505
Uh, a little help
with the fezzes?

19:17.573 --> 19:18.439
Okay.

19:42.029 --> 19:44.831
Hey, slim.
Free for dinner tonight?

19:44.899 --> 19:46.700
Well, that depends
on who's asking.

19:46.768 --> 19:48.469
Ah, nobody special.

19:48.536 --> 19:50.605
Got something for you.

19:50.672 --> 19:53.675
Can't show you here,
but it's a game changer.

19:53.743 --> 19:55.210
A man of mystery.

19:55.278 --> 19:57.112
I like that.

19:57.180 --> 19:58.914
Sam, we just got
an anonymous tip.

19:58.982 --> 20:00.616
Leo is gonna be in the lobby

20:00.683 --> 20:02.184
of the National Building
at 4:00.

20:02.252 --> 20:03.585
About time
we caught a break.

20:03.653 --> 20:04.953
You want to take Jim
for backup?

20:05.021 --> 20:06.321
No, I'll take Myka.
She's got great eyes.

20:06.389 --> 20:07.689
Okay, I'll take Jim.

20:07.757 --> 20:10.192
Come on, we'll coordinate
with local.

20:10.260 --> 20:12.127
Hey, I'll see you, Slim.
Don't be late.

20:18.101 --> 20:19.635
Lookin' through
the old case, huh?

20:19.703 --> 20:21.070
Yeah.

20:21.138 --> 20:22.272
Find anything?

20:22.339 --> 20:23.640
So far no luck.

20:23.708 --> 20:26.443
Jim, you and Sam
were close, right?

20:26.511 --> 20:29.079
Well, not as close
as you two, but yeah.

20:29.147 --> 20:30.982
The night Sam died,

20:31.049 --> 20:32.617
he was gonna
give me something.

20:32.685 --> 20:34.352
It was a card
or an envelope.

20:34.420 --> 20:35.921
Any guess
what was in it?

20:35.989 --> 20:37.255
No idea.

20:37.323 --> 20:39.390
Although he did say something

20:39.458 --> 20:42.125
about him wanting you
to move in with him.

20:42.193 --> 20:44.395
Maybe it was a key?

20:44.462 --> 20:46.397
A key?

20:46.464 --> 20:49.233
And maybe I shoulda just
left it at "no idea."

20:49.301 --> 20:52.169
No, no, it's fine.

20:52.237 --> 20:53.504
Besides, there's no key
in that box.

20:53.572 --> 20:54.905
Well, that's just
his office stuff.

20:54.973 --> 20:56.907
I mean, his personal stuff

20:56.975 --> 20:58.509
was sent to, uh...

20:58.577 --> 21:00.277
To where?

21:00.345 --> 21:03.147
It all went to Allison's.

21:03.215 --> 21:04.916
Who's Allison?

21:04.984 --> 21:07.685
Sam's wife.

21:16.729 --> 21:18.363
I could go in with you.

21:18.431 --> 21:19.864
Thanks.

21:19.932 --> 21:22.333
I need to do this alone.

21:26.806 --> 21:28.206
Okay.

21:39.818 --> 21:40.951
Myka?

21:41.019 --> 21:42.420
What are you doing here?

21:42.487 --> 21:43.621
Allison, hi.

21:43.689 --> 21:45.123
I'm sorry to bother you.

21:45.191 --> 21:46.124
I need your help.

21:46.192 --> 21:48.626
It's about Sam.

21:48.694 --> 21:49.694
Come in.

21:49.762 --> 21:51.764
Thank you.

21:53.133 --> 21:55.600
Guess we can talk in here.

21:57.637 --> 21:59.471
What's going on?

21:59.539 --> 22:01.974
I know that
this sounds strange,

22:02.041 --> 22:04.910
but I'm still tracking down
Sam's killer.

22:04.978 --> 22:06.979
Oh.

22:07.046 --> 22:09.548
The night that he died,

22:09.616 --> 22:11.316
Sam--Sam was gonna
give me something.

22:11.384 --> 22:13.686
The service gave you a box
of his personal effects.

22:13.754 --> 22:16.756
Can I--can I ask you
what was in it?

22:16.824 --> 22:19.125
Just office things.

22:19.193 --> 22:21.561
A change of clothes,
keepsakes.

22:21.629 --> 22:24.497
Photo of him and me.

22:24.565 --> 22:26.733
A photo of him and you.

22:30.571 --> 22:33.140
I really hate
to intrude like this.

22:33.207 --> 22:35.442
I know that this
is very awkward.

22:35.509 --> 22:38.878
Myka, I was so angry.

22:38.946 --> 22:40.947
At you.

22:41.015 --> 22:43.250
Not that you had
done anything wrong.

22:43.318 --> 22:44.986
We'd split up long before,

22:45.053 --> 22:48.389
but you were proof
that Sam had moved on.

22:48.457 --> 22:51.058
That was hard for me.

22:51.126 --> 22:52.527
I know.

22:52.594 --> 22:55.329
I used to give him grief

22:55.397 --> 22:58.432
that he always had
to have a backup plan.

22:58.500 --> 23:00.668
Well, I think
you were more to him

23:00.736 --> 23:03.104
than just a backup.

23:03.172 --> 23:06.741
And thank you
for speaking to me.

23:06.809 --> 23:09.744
It was probably just
a greeting card anyway.

23:09.812 --> 23:11.780
It wasn't--
- A card?

23:11.847 --> 23:13.548
Yeah.

23:13.616 --> 23:15.784
Wait.

23:23.194 --> 23:25.495
With everything
that happened after,

23:25.563 --> 23:27.231
the funeral,

23:27.298 --> 23:30.101
I didn't know
where to send it.

23:30.169 --> 23:31.936
I guess I didn't
try very hard either.

23:32.004 --> 23:33.638
I'm sorry.

23:33.706 --> 23:36.575
Thank you for
giving it to me now.

23:36.643 --> 23:39.611
On one condition.

23:39.679 --> 23:43.082
Get this guy, Myka.

23:43.150 --> 23:44.316
Get him.

23:53.459 --> 23:54.993
Thank goodness
she still had it.

24:07.037 --> 24:10.306
God, same knew that
I hated that song.

24:10.374 --> 24:12.475
So what's on it?
What did he write?

24:12.542 --> 24:14.176
Nothing.
Nothing.

24:14.244 --> 24:16.645
I mean,
it's another dead end.

24:21.084 --> 24:22.218
Bering.

24:23.353 --> 24:26.389
♪ Working at the car wash ♪

24:26.456 --> 24:28.024
Yeah, copy that.

24:28.092 --> 24:29.492
We'll be right there.

24:29.560 --> 24:30.827
Security detail,

24:30.894 --> 24:32.161
they just spotted Leo
at the train station.

24:32.229 --> 24:34.397
We get another chance.

24:37.634 --> 24:38.834
Hey, guys.

24:38.902 --> 24:40.002
Thanks for calling.
Where's Leo?

24:40.070 --> 24:41.437
He's in the waiting area.

24:41.505 --> 24:42.838
We got a man out front
playing janitor

24:42.906 --> 24:44.306
keeping an eye on him,

24:44.374 --> 24:45.708
and we got the other place
locked down.

24:45.775 --> 24:47.476
Your mission, Myka.
How do you wanna play it?

24:47.544 --> 24:49.245
Straight up.
No chase this time.

24:49.313 --> 24:52.181
We move in,
weapons ready but hidden.

24:52.249 --> 24:53.149
You guys go right,
I'll go left.

24:53.217 --> 24:54.417
I'll be on channel one.

24:54.485 --> 24:55.718
Pete, I need you
to stay here.

24:55.786 --> 24:57.053
Right.

24:57.120 --> 24:58.554
Wait.

24:58.622 --> 25:00.023
Myka, Myka, Myka.

25:00.090 --> 25:02.625
What--what?

25:02.693 --> 25:04.360
Look, I know that I can't
make you stay here,

25:04.428 --> 25:05.861
but I can beg you to.

25:05.929 --> 25:08.164
Why? No one
has your back like I do.

25:08.232 --> 25:11.000
I know, it's just...

25:11.068 --> 25:12.936
Look, the last time
I got a tip to nab Leo,

25:13.003 --> 25:14.971
my partner ended up...

25:18.109 --> 25:21.611
I could never
recover from that.

25:26.284 --> 25:28.218
All right, all right.

25:28.286 --> 25:29.953
This once, for you.

25:30.021 --> 25:31.689
But take him down, okay?

25:31.756 --> 25:33.123
And fast.

25:42.533 --> 25:44.234
Hands where
I can see them!

25:51.207 --> 25:52.441
He's got a gun!

25:55.911 --> 25:57.845
- Myka?
- Clean here.

25:57.913 --> 25:59.413
I had to take the shot.

25:59.481 --> 26:00.715
He had a weapon
out of nowhere.

26:00.783 --> 26:01.716
I know.

26:01.784 --> 26:02.884
Unit four, suspect down.

26:02.952 --> 26:03.885
Shots fired.

26:03.953 --> 26:05.420
He's got no pulse.

26:05.488 --> 26:06.888
Myka!

26:06.956 --> 26:08.323
What happened?

26:08.391 --> 26:10.291
Leo pulled his gun,
and Zach dropped him.

26:10.359 --> 26:11.627
So it's over.

26:11.694 --> 26:14.462
That's good, right?

26:14.530 --> 26:17.064
We need to find
that artifact.

26:30.326 --> 26:32.427
I bagged everything
that I could get my hands on.

26:32.495 --> 26:33.829
Nothing reacted.

26:33.896 --> 26:35.397
Well, it makes sense.

26:35.464 --> 26:39.634
I mean, if he coulda, you know,
teleported or whatever

26:39.702 --> 26:41.569
I guess he would have.
Something feels wrong.

26:41.637 --> 26:44.006
Myka, I trust my vibes,
right?

26:44.073 --> 26:45.640
Well, trust your instincts.

26:45.708 --> 26:47.375
You're the observant one.
Observe.

27:05.397 --> 27:07.666
Pete.

27:07.733 --> 27:09.367
Look at how he's
holding his weapon.

27:09.435 --> 27:11.403
He bats lefty.

27:11.471 --> 27:12.671
It's in his right hand.

27:12.738 --> 27:14.339
Right.
Okay, so options?

27:14.406 --> 27:15.840
Why would someone
purposefully hold their gun

27:15.908 --> 27:17.309
in the wrong hand?

27:17.376 --> 27:18.944
Uh...

27:19.011 --> 27:20.912
He got tired of running

27:20.980 --> 27:22.881
and wanted to end it
right here and now?

27:22.949 --> 27:24.850
Suicide by cop.
It's not Leo.

27:24.918 --> 27:26.418
Besides, I saw his face.
He was confused.

27:26.486 --> 27:27.819
He wasn't determined.

27:27.887 --> 27:29.788
Okay, okay,
so he's sitting there, right?

27:29.856 --> 27:31.289
You guys come up.

27:31.357 --> 27:34.326
He stands up to surrender
and then...

27:34.393 --> 27:36.828
Suddenly his gun
was pointed at me.

27:36.896 --> 27:38.630
Now what
do you mean suddenly?

27:38.697 --> 27:39.831
Suddenly, suddenly.

27:39.899 --> 27:41.466
Like, in the blink
of an eye.

27:41.534 --> 27:44.034
Okay, Myka,

27:44.102 --> 27:45.603
um, blink.

27:46.938 --> 27:49.105
I'm still here, right?

27:49.173 --> 27:50.540
Yes, Pete, you're still here.
What does that--

27:50.607 --> 27:54.109
Now close your eyes
and keep them closed.

27:54.177 --> 27:55.978
Close 'em.

27:56.046 --> 27:58.748
Okay, now open them.

27:58.816 --> 28:02.785
I disappeared, right?

28:02.853 --> 28:05.321
No.
You're behind me.

28:05.388 --> 28:08.057
No, I know, just--

28:08.125 --> 28:11.194
what if a blink lasted
longer than a blink

28:11.262 --> 28:13.163
and we didn't know it?

28:19.170 --> 28:22.773
You think the artifact
messes with time?

28:22.841 --> 28:24.409
Show me your watch.

28:24.476 --> 28:26.477
We synchronized our watches
in the alley, remember?

28:26.545 --> 28:27.645
And now?

28:30.216 --> 28:31.349
They're out of synch.

28:31.417 --> 28:32.316
You were outside
of the room

28:32.384 --> 28:33.484
when we went after Leo,

28:33.552 --> 28:35.419
and now my watch is--

28:35.487 --> 28:38.856
is behind your watch by...

28:38.924 --> 28:41.025
47 seconds.

28:41.093 --> 28:43.928
That could only mean
two things.

28:43.996 --> 28:45.763
Napoleon shared
a first kiss with Josephine

28:45.831 --> 28:47.431
that lasted
exactly that long.

28:47.499 --> 28:48.833
Yeah.

28:48.900 --> 28:50.834
Or ha!

28:50.902 --> 28:53.103
Google schmoogle,
I'll stick with paper.

28:53.171 --> 28:54.905
The U.S.S. Eldridge.

28:54.973 --> 28:58.142
A 1940s warship that docked
in the Philadelphia shipyards.

28:58.210 --> 28:59.710
Well, wait, wait,
wait a minute.

28:59.778 --> 29:02.380
The Philadelphia Experiment,
Artie?

29:02.448 --> 29:04.750
Please, please,
tell me that wasn't a hoax.

29:04.817 --> 29:06.518
No, no, no,
don't get too excited.

29:06.586 --> 29:07.987
The Eldridge was
the Navy's attempt

29:08.054 --> 29:09.755
to use high-powered
magnets and generators

29:09.823 --> 29:11.925
to create a cloaking device.
It kinda worked.

29:11.993 --> 29:16.129
It did look like the ship was
off the radar for 47 seconds.

29:16.197 --> 29:18.265
But really,
it just froze the radar screen

29:18.332 --> 29:19.733
while the ship kept moving?

29:19.801 --> 29:23.404
But the energy released
from that temporal disturbance

29:23.472 --> 29:25.473
may have given birth
to an artifact

29:25.541 --> 29:28.009
that recreates the effect.

29:28.077 --> 29:29.978
Right, but only over
a limited area.

29:30.046 --> 29:31.179
47 seconds.

29:31.247 --> 29:32.481
That's more than enough time

29:32.548 --> 29:34.049
for Leo to make it
over the alley wall.

29:34.117 --> 29:36.451
It's also enough time
for someone to freeze the team

29:36.518 --> 29:38.253
and put a gun
into Leo's wrong hand.

29:38.321 --> 29:41.089
Which suggests that
whoever is holding the artifact

29:41.157 --> 29:42.757
can also move
through the freeze.

29:42.825 --> 29:44.959
Leo wasn't working alone.
He's got a partner.

29:45.027 --> 29:46.761
Or did until
his partner set him up

29:46.829 --> 29:48.129
to take the fall today.

29:48.197 --> 29:49.798
Excuse me.

29:49.865 --> 29:52.767
If I may, good-bye.

29:52.835 --> 29:55.069
How could I have been
so stupid?

29:55.137 --> 29:56.837
All this time
I've been chasing Leo,

29:56.905 --> 29:59.106
and there's
been somebody else.

29:59.174 --> 30:00.808
All right,
so now that we know that,

30:00.875 --> 30:02.109
we just have
to go after him.

30:02.177 --> 30:03.577
Him? Her?

30:03.645 --> 30:05.645
I mean, literally, it could
be anybody out there.

30:05.713 --> 30:07.013
Easy, easy,
don't you think

30:07.081 --> 30:08.581
you're exaggerating
just a little?

30:08.649 --> 30:11.217
No, I don't because
this case just blew up.

30:11.285 --> 30:14.154
It blew up again.

30:14.221 --> 30:15.689
Myka. Myka!

30:15.756 --> 30:18.291
Myka!

30:18.359 --> 30:20.327
We'll take it
one step at a time, right?

30:20.395 --> 30:23.030
We'll start
identifying suspects.

30:23.098 --> 30:25.199
No.

30:25.266 --> 30:27.902
You--you do it, okay?
Because I am out.

30:27.970 --> 30:29.137
Wait, what?

30:29.204 --> 30:32.007
Pete...

30:32.075 --> 30:34.610
For three years
I have done nothing

30:34.677 --> 30:36.545
but fail on this case.

30:36.613 --> 30:39.582
I failed as
a Secret Service Agent,

30:39.649 --> 30:41.984
I failed
as a Warehouse Agent,

30:42.051 --> 30:45.888
and I failed
as Sam's partner.

30:45.955 --> 30:48.591
I was his backup, Pete.

30:58.868 --> 31:00.668
Now it's important you not
make any sudden moves.

31:00.736 --> 31:02.637
If the hat gets knocked off,

31:02.705 --> 31:05.573
the receiver could pull in
a massive amount of static.

31:05.641 --> 31:06.707
The downside.

31:06.775 --> 31:08.909
Yes.

31:08.977 --> 31:11.478
One night an audience member
pulled off Coco's fez

31:11.546 --> 31:15.415
and Raymond Fraser
was never the same.

31:15.483 --> 31:17.017
Mr. Mental went mental?

31:17.084 --> 31:22.189
Just keep the hat
on the dog's head.

31:22.256 --> 31:24.457
Claudia, you're gonna write
down the license plate numbers.

31:24.525 --> 31:26.126
As soon as
you bark them out.

31:28.563 --> 31:31.564
I suppose you've got several
of those bon mots at the ready.

31:31.632 --> 31:33.366
More than 5,
less than 100.

31:33.434 --> 31:34.901
- Hooray.
- I've got three.

31:34.969 --> 31:37.103
Just put our fezzes
on our heads

31:37.171 --> 31:38.972
simultaneously please.

31:39.040 --> 31:41.175
Simultaneously.

31:41.242 --> 31:42.343
On our heads simultaneously,
not--

31:55.191 --> 31:56.157
This seems dangerous.

31:56.225 --> 31:57.658
Yeah.

31:57.726 --> 31:58.959
Someone could take
a picture

31:59.027 --> 32:01.928
and post it on the Internet.

32:01.996 --> 32:03.497
- Three, eight, five!
- Whoa, halfway there.

32:08.402 --> 32:11.637
That stupid scarab!

32:17.144 --> 32:18.478
Artie.

32:18.546 --> 32:19.713
Watch the hat!

32:19.780 --> 32:20.714
Grab his tail,
grab his tail.

32:20.781 --> 32:21.648
The hat!
Watch the hat!

32:21.716 --> 32:22.916
Grab his tail!

32:22.984 --> 32:24.684
Doggy, doggy, doggy,
doggy, doggy, doggy.

32:36.697 --> 32:40.666
- Hey.
- Hey.

32:40.734 --> 32:42.935
So you feelin' any better

32:43.002 --> 32:45.570
after your little
fit back there?

32:45.638 --> 32:47.906
Not really, no.

32:47.974 --> 32:50.509
That's a shame.
It was a good one.

32:53.879 --> 32:56.314
You know, Myka, you only fail
if you give up.

32:59.418 --> 33:01.185
I know.

33:01.253 --> 33:03.054
All right,
so what would Sam say?

33:08.361 --> 33:10.328
Stay focused, Slim.

33:10.396 --> 33:12.998
Eyes and ears open.

33:13.065 --> 33:15.133
Don't get emotional.

33:15.201 --> 33:17.802
Ah, well,
there you go.

33:17.870 --> 33:20.171
He said it, not me.

33:20.239 --> 33:22.407
Don't--don't get emotional.

33:22.475 --> 33:23.908
I gotta tell you,

33:23.976 --> 33:27.379
it's kinda the opposite
of what you're doing right now.

33:27.446 --> 33:28.847
Ears open.

33:30.483 --> 33:31.783
The card.

33:31.851 --> 33:34.219
Sam's card.
Where is it?

33:34.287 --> 33:35.454
Where did it?

33:35.521 --> 33:37.589
Right here, right here.

33:37.657 --> 33:39.091
Okay, he loved his backups,

33:39.159 --> 33:41.794
and he knew that
I hated this song.

33:44.064 --> 33:46.166
If he was here right now,
he would make me listen to it,

33:46.234 --> 33:48.002
right till the end,
just to torture me.

33:48.069 --> 33:50.237
I love this guy.

33:50.305 --> 33:52.006
You said no one would
connect me to the plates,

33:52.074 --> 33:54.442
but now this guy Sam
is all over me.

33:54.510 --> 33:55.743
It's Leo's voice.

33:55.811 --> 33:57.511
So he's good.
That's your problem.

33:57.579 --> 33:59.480
You're on his team,
talk to him,

33:59.548 --> 34:01.148
offer to cut him in.

34:01.216 --> 34:03.151
Game changer.

34:03.219 --> 34:05.220
That's why Sam wanted
to take me to dinner.

34:05.287 --> 34:07.555
He wanted to talk to me
outside of the office.

34:07.623 --> 34:09.489
Boy scout, huh?

34:09.558 --> 34:11.759
All right,
I'll take care of him.

34:11.827 --> 34:15.130
Use the thing.
He'll never see it coming.

34:15.197 --> 34:17.132
My God,
the only other agents

34:17.199 --> 34:20.101
who were on that case with us
were Zach and Jim.

34:20.168 --> 34:22.402
All right,
so what are you thinking?

34:22.471 --> 34:24.806
It's time to do
something impulsive.

34:32.917 --> 34:35.284
Hey, sweetie.
Where are you, buddy?

34:35.353 --> 34:36.420
Poochie!

34:36.487 --> 34:37.855
Come on, boy.
You wanna play?

34:37.922 --> 34:39.324
Huh?

34:39.391 --> 34:41.393
Here, doggy.

34:41.460 --> 34:42.960
This was cute
for, like, a minute.

34:43.027 --> 34:44.795
Yeah, come on.

34:44.862 --> 34:46.429
Play fetch
with your Uncle Steve.

34:46.498 --> 34:48.465
Here, doggy.
Nice doggy.

34:48.533 --> 34:49.533
Hey, pooch!

34:49.601 --> 34:50.534
Ringa-ding-ding.

34:55.106 --> 34:56.940
The things I do for Artie.

34:57.007 --> 34:59.609
Hey, any sign
of the dog?

34:59.677 --> 35:01.445
No, but I know how to make
him come to us.

35:03.381 --> 35:04.515
Pavlov's bell.

35:04.582 --> 35:05.783
You know--whoa,
that happened fast.

35:05.850 --> 35:06.784
What?

35:06.851 --> 35:07.818
The downside.

35:07.886 --> 35:09.020
Getting a little slurpy.

35:09.087 --> 35:11.322
I'll be fine tomorrow.

35:16.163 --> 35:18.531
Hey, boy, you still
got your hat on.

35:18.598 --> 35:20.333
Good boy.

35:20.401 --> 35:22.702
What's that in your mouth?

35:25.005 --> 35:27.372
Who's a good scarab killer?
You are.

35:27.440 --> 35:30.409
Yes, you are.

35:30.476 --> 35:31.810
Ah, uh...

35:31.878 --> 35:34.012
Claude.

35:34.079 --> 35:35.246
Did I get it?

35:35.314 --> 35:37.515
Uh, sure.

35:37.583 --> 35:39.550
Yeah.
Yeah, you're good to go.

35:39.618 --> 35:40.718
Come on, hey, let's get you
back to Artie.

35:40.785 --> 35:42.619
Come on.

35:51.562 --> 35:53.196
What's going on?
You said it was urgent.

35:53.263 --> 35:55.097
You need to come with us
to see Zach.

35:55.165 --> 35:57.200
And get some cuffs.

35:59.402 --> 36:00.369
Zach.

36:00.437 --> 36:02.538
Got your message.

36:02.606 --> 36:04.640
Kind of formal just for
you to say good-bye.

36:04.707 --> 36:06.441
Actually, it's you
who's saying good-bye, Zach.

36:06.509 --> 36:07.943
Yeah, we know everything,

36:08.011 --> 36:09.644
how you worked with Leo
to get the plates.

36:09.712 --> 36:11.012
And when Sam got to close,
you dropped him.

36:11.080 --> 36:13.781
All for a lousy promotion.

36:13.849 --> 36:14.882
What?

36:14.950 --> 36:16.784
Myka, are you crazy?

36:16.852 --> 36:19.153
You're under arrest, Zach.

36:19.220 --> 36:20.320
Jim, what are they
talking about?

36:20.388 --> 36:21.755
I have no idea.

36:21.823 --> 36:23.423
We've got the recording
or Leo talking to you

36:23.491 --> 36:24.725
about killing Sam.

36:24.792 --> 36:26.727
Okay, that is ridiculous.

36:26.795 --> 36:28.096
I'm done listening
to this crap.

36:28.164 --> 36:29.598
Hey, stop right there.

36:34.071 --> 36:35.271
Zach, he's got a gun!

36:47.919 --> 36:49.654
The ship's barometer.

36:49.721 --> 36:52.823
You know about it?

36:52.891 --> 36:54.291
I know that
you can stop time.

36:58.797 --> 37:01.831
And I know that you sent Sam
into the National Building

37:01.899 --> 37:03.533
with a big target
on his chest.

37:03.601 --> 37:04.768
Sam, wait!

37:04.836 --> 37:06.737
When he picked you
to back him up...

37:06.805 --> 37:08.239
I'll take Myka.
She's got great eyes.

37:08.307 --> 37:09.741
I knew he had his doubts
about me.

37:09.809 --> 37:11.943
So you killed him?

37:13.613 --> 37:16.648
No, but I held you
back long enough so Leo could.

37:16.716 --> 37:19.384
That's why I was late.

37:19.452 --> 37:21.053
By 47 seconds.

37:23.023 --> 37:24.857
It's happening again.

37:30.030 --> 37:32.064
I'll take that.

37:45.947 --> 37:46.880
What the hell?

37:46.948 --> 37:48.815
Oh, my God.

37:48.883 --> 37:50.484
Oh, my God, Jim.

37:50.551 --> 37:52.519
Myka.

37:52.587 --> 37:55.022
Myka, are you okay?

37:55.090 --> 37:57.225
Myka, what happened?

37:57.292 --> 37:58.860
Zach, I'm so sorry.

37:58.927 --> 38:00.629
Look, Jim--

38:00.696 --> 38:02.397
Jim was working with Leo,
and Sam got in his way

38:02.465 --> 38:03.965
just like we were about to.

38:04.033 --> 38:05.500
Holy mother.
In here!

38:09.238 --> 38:10.571
He got shot.

38:10.639 --> 38:12.306
Hey, Myks.

38:16.144 --> 38:17.945
Is--is it over?

38:19.781 --> 38:20.948
Yeah, it's over.

38:22.717 --> 38:24.051
Do you feel better?

38:28.022 --> 38:30.190
No.

38:45.672 --> 38:47.240
What'd you tell the FBI?

38:47.308 --> 38:48.808
That it all happened
in the blink of an eye,

38:48.876 --> 38:51.111
Jim went bad,
and Zach acted by the book.

38:51.178 --> 38:52.379
Did you give them
the recording?

38:52.447 --> 38:54.648
First I made a copy.
You know, for backup.

38:54.716 --> 38:57.718
Ooh, Sam taught you well.

38:57.786 --> 38:59.354
When did you know it was Jim
and not Zach?

38:59.421 --> 39:02.524
Well, not until Jim
pulled out the barometer.

39:02.592 --> 39:03.625
Uh-huh, uh-huh.

39:03.693 --> 39:04.860
So pretty much
the last second.

39:04.927 --> 39:06.528
Risky sting operation.

39:06.596 --> 39:08.764
Impulsive, emotional.

39:08.831 --> 39:09.998
Classic Myka.

39:10.066 --> 39:11.199
You knew before I did,
didn't you?

39:11.267 --> 39:12.734
Knew what?

39:12.802 --> 39:14.169
Don't play dumb with me,
Lattimer.

39:14.237 --> 39:15.503
Who, me?
What you talkin' bout, Willis?

39:15.571 --> 39:16.938
Pete.

39:17.006 --> 39:18.973
All right, all right,
maybe a little.

39:19.041 --> 39:21.009
I mean, I knew that Leo couldn't
have poofed out of that alley

39:21.076 --> 39:22.877
without a little help,

39:22.945 --> 39:25.780
and you weren't being
entirely rational.

39:25.848 --> 39:27.549
So I thought I needed to--

39:27.616 --> 39:29.584
Gently walk me through it.

39:29.652 --> 39:32.621
Let me discover the proof
so I'd believe it.

39:32.689 --> 39:34.723
It was your case
to solve, Agent Bering,

39:34.791 --> 39:38.961
and you did it.

39:39.029 --> 39:42.064
Thank you for...

39:42.132 --> 39:44.833
You know,
being so patient with me.

39:44.901 --> 39:46.702
It was a little trick
I learned

39:46.769 --> 39:49.005
from my overly-cautious
partner.

39:51.074 --> 39:52.475
Ah!
Myka.

39:52.543 --> 39:54.377
Allison.

39:54.444 --> 39:55.745
All right,
I'll see you outside.

39:55.812 --> 39:58.114
Okay.

39:58.182 --> 39:59.950
We got him.

40:00.017 --> 40:02.152
We finally got him.

40:02.220 --> 40:03.587
I heard.

40:03.655 --> 40:05.156
Zach called.

40:05.224 --> 40:06.424
Ah.

40:06.491 --> 40:10.194
Thank you.

40:12.665 --> 40:15.534
Um...

40:26.412 --> 40:28.079
It's for both of us.

41:02.122 --> 41:03.422
Judging from the look
on his face,

41:03.490 --> 41:05.458
something's about
to come out.

41:05.525 --> 41:07.426
Please let it be
numbers and letters.

41:07.494 --> 41:08.527
Q, nine, three.

41:08.594 --> 41:09.828
Six digits, all I need.

41:14.801 --> 41:16.735
Oh, did you get it?

41:16.803 --> 41:17.903
Yes, Claudia's searching
right now.

41:17.971 --> 41:19.972
Ah, yeah.
That wasn't so bad.

41:20.039 --> 41:21.340
Claudia--

41:21.407 --> 41:23.843
Claudia, what the hell?
- Pavlov's bell.

41:23.910 --> 41:25.711
Ooh, you know that causes
excessive drooling for--

41:25.779 --> 41:26.712
I got that.
Thank you.

41:26.780 --> 41:29.515
Yeah.

41:31.751 --> 41:33.185
Oh, yeah.

41:33.253 --> 41:34.586
Yeah, I've seen
where that tongue has been.

41:34.653 --> 41:35.854
So what do we do
with him now?

41:35.921 --> 41:37.088
We take him back
to Wisconsin?

41:37.156 --> 41:38.589
Mrs. Hodgson
says he's a stray.

41:38.657 --> 41:39.924
Finders keepers.
Which is good,

41:39.991 --> 41:41.325
because we couldn't
give him back.

41:41.393 --> 41:43.527
The psychic bond between us
is just too strong.

41:43.595 --> 41:44.695
He owns me now.

41:44.762 --> 41:46.897
No, you mean
that you own him.

41:46.964 --> 41:48.431
No, no, we don't own dogs.
Dogs own us.

41:48.499 --> 41:50.033
Cats are prisoners,
but dogs own us.

41:50.100 --> 41:51.434
His name, by the way,
is Trai.

41:51.502 --> 41:52.836
- Trai?
- Yeah, it's short for trailer.

41:52.904 --> 41:54.738
Got a match.

41:54.806 --> 41:56.774
Our evil car belongs
to a rental company.

41:56.842 --> 41:57.842
Surprise, surprise.

41:57.910 --> 41:59.177
Which would require

41:59.244 --> 42:00.511
a driver's license.

42:00.579 --> 42:02.247
Can you get into
the company's computer?

42:02.315 --> 42:04.517
Please.
Does a cheese doodle?

42:04.584 --> 42:06.886
Hello, gorgeous.

42:06.954 --> 42:08.288
Our doorknob stealer
is rather perky

42:08.355 --> 42:10.290
in a roadside diner
waitress kind of way.

42:10.358 --> 42:12.159
What the hell?

42:12.226 --> 42:14.060
Artie.

42:15.997 --> 42:17.832
Oh, dear God.

42:17.899 --> 42:19.233
Sally Stukowski.

42:19.301 --> 42:20.501
Do we know her?

42:20.569 --> 42:22.137
Worse.

42:22.204 --> 42:24.606
She knows us.
