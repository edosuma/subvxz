00:06.680 --> 00:11.560
[GIRL] The park was called 
 Playland, and it was the best.

00:11.560 --> 00:15.960

 and get scared to death on rides

00:15.960 --> 00:19.600
and stuff up on junk food 
 and ditch your parents...

00:19.600 --> 00:21.560

00:21.560 --> 00:26.400

 called Laughing in the Dark.

This is a clown story. 
 I hate clowns.

01:04.000 --> 01:06.800
They're creepy. They give me 
 nightmares. Where's my thermos?

01:06.800 --> 01:09.640
Oh, I heard of that. 
 They call it Bozophoebia.

01:09.640 --> 01:12.360

Go on, Beth. 
 Let's see if she can handle it.

01:33.120 --> 01:34.440

01:34.440 --> 01:37.960
- Start for real this time. 
 - OK.

01:37.960 --> 01:41.440
Submitted for the approval 
 of the Midnight Society,

01:41.440 --> 01:44.800

01:55.880 --> 01:59.360
If was Friday night, 
 and Playland was jammed.

01:59.360 --> 02:02.200
For thousands of kids, 
 it had everything they wanted,

02:02.200 --> 02:06.920
but for one kid, 
 it had just a little too much.

02:06.920 --> 02:08.720
- Man, that was cool. 
 - I know.

02:08.720 --> 02:10.280
Man, that was awesome!

02:10.280 --> 02:12.320
Don't give me that. 
 You almost hurled.

02:12.320 --> 02:13.600
Did not.

02:13.600 --> 02:16.160
So why were you 
 screaming, "Stop the rides!"?

02:16.160 --> 02:17.800
'Cause Kathy was scared.

02:17.800 --> 02:19.880
Was not. 
 You were gonna barf!

02:19.880 --> 02:24.200

 - Gimme a break!

02:49.360 --> 02:51.160
I heard the same thing.

02:51.160 --> 02:53.200
Weird things happen in there.

02:53.200 --> 02:55.200
Something to do with a clown.

04:33.520 --> 04:36.120
Yeah! What kinda stranger 
 stuff happened inside the ride?

04:36.120 --> 04:39.200
Well, that's what 
 the kids wanted to know,

04:39.200 --> 04:40.880
especially weegee.

04:40.880 --> 04:42.960
Most of this is pretty boring.

04:42.960 --> 04:46.000
It's all pretty boring, 
 if you ask me.

04:46.000 --> 04:49.640
- We didn't ask you. 
 - But then I found this.

04:49.640 --> 04:53.320
"Cagey Clown Caught in Calamity."

04:53.320 --> 04:56.040
The Laughter in the Dark 
 spook house isn't the original.

04:56.040 --> 04:59.160
There was another one on 
 the same spot back in the 1920s.

04:59.160 --> 05:02.200
- Yeah, so? 
 - So, in 1924 the circus came to town

05:02.200 --> 05:04.360
and set up a new Playland.

05:04.360 --> 05:07.160
One of their clowns, some dude 
 named Zeebo, was a foul ball.

05:07.160 --> 05:09.320
'The clowen known as Zeebo

05:09.320 --> 05:13.440
"stole the whole entire circus 
 payroll of $4,000." Wow.

05:13.440 --> 05:16.560
He got caught, though, 
 and the chased him into Playland.

05:16.560 --> 05:18.520
He ran into the spook house,

05:18.520 --> 05:21.200
and he would have 
 gotten away, except...

05:21.200 --> 05:23.480
- The cigar! 
 - Cigar?

05:23.480 --> 05:25.120
Zeebo smoked cigars.

05:25.120 --> 05:28.320
The police figured he threw 
 one away in the spook house,

05:28.320 --> 05:32.480
because the whole place 
 caught fire with him inside.

05:32.480 --> 05:34.080
"The fire spread quickly,

05:34.080 --> 05:36.920
"and attempts to rescue 
 Zeebo were futile.

05:36.920 --> 05:39.800
Tragically, the clown perished 
 into the inferno."

05:39.800 --> 05:41.000
Eew.

05:41.000 --> 05:43.440
Ha. Smoking's bad 
 for your health.

05:43.440 --> 05:46.480
A couple years later, they build 
 another Laughing in the Dark

05:46.480 --> 05:49.360
and make a spooky dummy 
 of Zeebo to scare everyone.

05:49.360 --> 05:50.960
Legend has it that--

05:50.960 --> 05:54.680
Legend has it the ghost 
 of Zeebo is still there...

05:55.560 --> 05:58.280
Trapped... for all time.

05:58.280 --> 06:01.880
- Exactly. 
 - I bet I know why, too.

06:01.880 --> 06:03.280
Why?

06:03.280 --> 06:05.920
I bet he likes to trap 
 small children inside

06:05.920 --> 06:07.840
and tickle them!

06:07.840 --> 06:09.920
Tickle, tickle, tickle!

 to tickle you!

 - Me? You guys are the feebs.

 there's a ghost clown

06:28.400 --> 06:30.880

 in some dumb old ride?

06:30.880 --> 06:33.200
Kids have seen and 
 heard things in there.

06:33.200 --> 06:36.360
It's a spook house, lameball. 
 It's supposed to be spooky.

06:36.360 --> 06:39.440
You gotta be some kind 
 of doofus to think it's real.

06:39.440 --> 06:41.080
Aah! 
 Boo!

06:41.080 --> 06:44.040
You don't see me gettin' 
 scared of that junk.

06:46.200 --> 06:49.360
Yeah? If you're so brave, 
 why didn't you go in?

06:49.360 --> 06:52.200
In fact, I dare you to go in. 
 Alone.

 as chicken as we are.

 he goes all the way inside?

 Unless you wanna come with me.

07:09.760 --> 07:11.320
She's right.

07:11.320 --> 07:14.320
You could just hang inside 
 the door and never go through.

07:14.320 --> 07:15.800
Tell ya what, gutless.

07:15.800 --> 07:19.240
Not only am I gonna go 
 through this while place alone,

07:19.240 --> 07:21.680

 the dummy clown,

07:21.680 --> 07:23.720
I'm gonna steal his nose.

16:11.880 --> 16:14.520
or you're gonna get beaned!

16:19.000 --> 16:20.680
Aah!

16:28.040 --> 16:31.280
Good thing Weegee 
 can't see me now.

16:35.520 --> 16:38.040
[PHONE RINGS]

16:38.040 --> 16:40.600
Oh, man! 
 What is wrong with me?

[RING]

16:43.800 --> 16:45.040
Hello?

16:45.040 --> 16:47.680
- Hey, Josh. This is Weegee. 
 - Yeah, Weeg. What's up?

16:47.680 --> 16:51.440
Listen, I, uh... I was kinda 
 being a baby this afternoon.

16:51.440 --> 16:54.240
You won the bet and 
 I shouldn't be mad at you.

16:54.240 --> 16:56.320
That's OK. 
 I was giving you a hard time.

16:56.320 --> 16:57.960
Tell you what.

16:57.960 --> 17:00.600
I'll only make you wear 
 the nose to school for one day.

17:00.600 --> 17:02.840
I was kinda hoping 
 you'd forget it completely.

17:02.840 --> 17:06.480
You're a dreamin', pal. 
 Tomorrow's Zeebo day for you.

17:06.480 --> 17:08.119
Ha ha ha. Later.

17:17.240 --> 17:17.960
[RING]

17:20.040 --> 17:23.160
One day's the best I'm gonna do.

17:23.160 --> 17:26.760
[SCRATCHY VOICE] 
 Give it back.

17:26.760 --> 17:31.000
Give it back! 
 Ha ha ha ha ha!

17:31.000 --> 17:34.120
No way, Weegee. 
 You're not scarin' me.

17:34.120 --> 17:35.960
Ha ha ha ha ha ha!

17:37.960 --> 17:41.920
It's a joke. 
 He's trying to get me.

17:41.920 --> 17:44.960
I'll show him. 
 I'm not scared.

17:44.960 --> 17:47.040
He can't scare me with kid stuff.

17:47.040 --> 17:50.200
There's no such thing 
 as Zeebo the Clown.

17:52.920 --> 17:54.920
[DIGGING THROUGH SILVERWARE]

17:54.920 --> 17:57.600

[SNIFFS] 
 Cigar smoke?

Weegee, this is Josh. 
 I'm--

18:41.600 --> 18:44.240
-Josh? Slow down. 
 - Tell me the truth.

18:44.240 --> 18:48.720
Did you call my house before 
 and you pretend you were Zeebo?

18:48.720 --> 18:50.640
[LAUGHS] Whoa, 
 what's the matter, Josh?

18:50.640 --> 18:53.480
- You sound kinda scared. 
 - I'm not.

18:53.480 --> 18:55.080
Yeah, OK, OK. 
 I'm scared.

18:55.080 --> 18:58.240
I was scared on the ride, 
 and I'm really scared now.

18:58.240 --> 19:01.360
- Was that you? 
 - Give me a break. Why would I--

19:01.360 --> 19:05.160
- [CLICK] 
 - What was that? Is that you, Kathy?

19:05.160 --> 19:06.840
Put down the phone.

19:06.840 --> 19:08.800
Josh, we only have one phone.

19:08.800 --> 19:11.200
It's gotta be at your house.

19:11.200 --> 19:13.400
[SCRATCHY VOICE] 
 If ya don't give it back,

19:13.400 --> 19:15.280
I'll come up and get it!

19:15.280 --> 19:17.440
[WEEGEE] 
 Who was that?!

19:18.920 --> 19:20.600
Josh, you there?

19:49.680 --> 19:51.400
[POP!]

20:54.080 --> 20:56.440

20:58.760 --> 21:00.400
[SQUEEEE-AK]

21:16.960 --> 21:19.880
OK. I shouldn't 
 have taken your nose.

21:19.880 --> 21:22.000
I'm sorry.

21:25.280 --> 21:28.240
There. 
 It's all yours.

21:28.240 --> 21:30.480
And, uh...

21:30.480 --> 21:33.360
just to show there's 
 no hard feelings,

21:33.360 --> 21:35.560
cigars. Ha.

21:36.840 --> 21:39.320
All for you.

Ah ha ha ha ha ha ha!

22:39.560 --> 22:41.640
The End.

22:41.640 --> 22:44.440
So it was the crazy 
 old guy all along.

22:44.440 --> 22:47.840
No way. He couldn't have done 
 that stuff in the house.

22:47.840 --> 22:52.000
Maybe the old guy 
 was really Zeebo's ghost.

22:52.000 --> 22:54.080
Yeah!

22:54.440 --> 22:56.440
So what do you think, Kristen?

22:56.440 --> 22:58.760
Is Zeebo gonna pay you 
 a visit tonight?

22:58.760 --> 23:00.680
Sorry, Kiki. I did it.

23:00.680 --> 23:03.680
I sat through the whole story, 
 and I'm OK.

23:03.680 --> 23:05.760
What do you say to that?

23:05.760 --> 23:07.560
I'd say that's a good thing,

23:07.560 --> 23:10.240
because we wouldn't want you 
 having nightmares, would wet?

23:10.240 --> 23:11.240
