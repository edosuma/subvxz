No, seriously, Ty. Thank you.

08:50.138 --> 08:51.574
Thank you for helping me out
moving into this new place.

08:51.618 --> 08:54.708
This whole thing goes
a lot faster with two people.

Whoa, is this eight-millimeter?

08:58.973 --> 09:00.714

you were into film.

Oh, that belonged to Patience.
Uh, she carried that everywhere.

it if you like.

09:27.436 --> 09:30.091
Well, it's official. MediCo
is buying my dad's facility.

09:30.134 --> 09:32.441
I thought it was just a rumor.[sighs] It was,

09:32.484 --> 09:35.139
but the CEO just confirmed it
in an interview.

09:35.183 --> 09:36.314
This is a nightmare.

09:36.358 --> 09:38.447
I did some digging on MediCo.

09:38.490 --> 09:40.536
Every hospital they've bought,
they've raised the cost.

09:40.580 --> 09:42.320
Okay, so move your dad
somewhere else.

09:42.364 --> 09:44.279

like my dad,

09:44.322 --> 09:46.455

let him be six hours away.

09:52.287 --> 09:54.898
If he moves...

09:54.942 --> 09:57.335
I'd have to move with him.

09:58.467 --> 09:59.947
Well, I've been in
a good place lately.

he gets to me.

10:03.167 --> 10:04.429

10:04.473 --> 10:06.214
Well, I saw him yesterday
and he brought up

10:06.257 --> 10:08.433
some of my more difficult
moments with Danny.

10:08.477 --> 10:10.174

10:10.218 --> 10:12.350

10:14.962 --> 10:17.791
He refuses to acknowledge

10:17.834 --> 10:20.271
any damage that he has
caused this family.

10:20.315 --> 10:22.752
We've all caused
our fair share, Mom.

10:22.796 --> 10:24.493

the most terrible thing.

10:24.536 --> 10:26.887
At least I'm trying
to face my faults.

10:26.930 --> 10:28.758
He is completely
ignoring the fact

10:28.802 --> 10:30.760
that when you walk
out on your family,

10:30.804 --> 10:32.370
you actually leave
them with damage.

10:34.242 --> 10:36.026
I'm really proud of the progress

10:36.070 --> 10:37.332
that you have made
in this program,

10:37.375 --> 10:38.768
but none of it
is gonna be permanent

10:38.812 --> 10:40.944
unless you can accept
that the root cause

10:40.988 --> 10:43.947
of your bad behavior
wasn't Paul,

10:43.991 --> 10:46.036
or Danny or me.

10:46.080 --> 10:48.299
There's always gonna be
someone else to blame.

10:48.343 --> 10:49.779
But if you do that,
you're never gonna confront

10:49.823 --> 10:51.302
your part
in your own failures.

10:51.346 --> 10:54.262

you can't fix it, Mom.

counseling is super weird.

No, right now,

20:07.118 --> 20:09.643
he's just on a spontaneous

20:09.686 --> 20:11.166
And I want to keep it that way.

20:17.825 --> 20:19.087
This is
all pretty standard stuff.

20:19.130 --> 20:20.741
The only twist

20:20.784 --> 20:22.699
is Adam seeking sole custody.

20:22.743 --> 20:24.701
And he's filing
in New Hampshire.

20:31.273 --> 20:33.797
He wanted this as far
from Greylock as possible.

20:33.841 --> 20:34.885
To keep it out of my reach.

20:34.929 --> 20:36.800
Not that I could do
much anyways.

20:36.844 --> 20:39.020

I am still Josh's mom.

20:41.109 --> 20:43.198
That has to count for something.

20:43.242 --> 20:45.156
The courts usually decide

20:45.200 --> 20:47.942
in favor of the mother
in cases like this,

20:47.985 --> 20:51.685
especially if the child
is happy and healthy.

20:51.728 --> 20:55.166
And Adam did take Josh across
an international boundary.

20:55.210 --> 20:57.691
It's not illegal for a
spouse to take a child

20:57.734 --> 20:59.301
without permission
if the parents aren't

20:59.345 --> 21:04.175
already involved
in a custody dispute.

21:04.219 --> 21:06.961
But what Adam did
does not look good.

21:07.004 --> 21:11.095

back home in no time, okay?

21:13.576 --> 21:15.317
