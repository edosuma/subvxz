00:05.266 --> 00:08.921
â™ª

00:08.965 --> 00:09.922
[Sarah gasps]

00:09.966 --> 00:12.838
Capero326 strikes again.

00:12.882 --> 00:13.970
It looks like they've nailed

00:14.014 --> 00:15.406
another two guys
at the State Department.

00:15.450 --> 00:17.843
That's 11 indictments
based on your document leak.

00:17.887 --> 00:20.324
Yeah, no doubt. You
know, my coming forward

00:20.368 --> 00:21.456
made the leak undeniable.

00:21.499 --> 00:23.632
Weston was right.

00:23.675 --> 00:26.417
Sorry. How are you
doing with that?

00:26.461 --> 00:29.159
Oh, okay, considering I can't

00:29.203 --> 00:31.031
turn on the TV
or look at my phone

00:31.074 --> 00:35.731
without seeing my ex-boyfriend's
stupid, handsome face.

00:35.774 --> 00:37.602
It still stings.
He was really...

00:37.646 --> 00:39.778
Yeah. I know.

00:39.822 --> 00:41.693
[horn honks][gasps]

00:41.737 --> 00:43.347
Sorry.You don't have to flinch
every time you hear

00:43.391 --> 00:44.914
a loud noise, you know,
I'm all right.

00:44.957 --> 00:47.047
The American government
knows where you are now.

00:47.090 --> 00:50.702
The American government
has no jurisdiction here.

00:50.746 --> 00:53.662
This is Greylock.
Non-extradition, remember?

00:53.705 --> 00:55.620
Yeah, I'm sure they would
ignore that fact

00:55.664 --> 00:57.709
if it meant getting
their hands on you.

00:57.753 --> 01:00.756
"Human Rights Violations by the
CIA" has its own Wikipedia page.

01:00.799 --> 01:03.889
You know, if bad guys jumped
out from behind a bush,

01:03.933 --> 01:06.109
I got our trusty guard dog here
to protect us.

01:06.153 --> 01:07.980
Yeah. Fenway's afraid
of marshmallows.

01:08.024 --> 01:11.549
I don't think she'd be much help
with CIA commandos.

01:11.593 --> 01:15.423
You know, six weeks ago,
if the Feds had

01:15.466 --> 01:17.599
wanted to throw me off
the roof of that building,

01:17.642 --> 01:19.688
you would've run across
the street to grab a ladder.

01:19.731 --> 01:21.733
What can I say,
you've grown on me,

01:21.777 --> 01:23.822
like a barnacle or a fungus.

01:23.866 --> 01:25.563
Just be careful, okay?

01:25.607 --> 01:26.956
I will.

01:29.045 --> 01:31.526
Really, Fenway?

01:31.569 --> 01:32.918
Marshmallows?

01:34.572 --> 01:36.661
AJ:
The flood may be over, but
our problems are just beginning.

01:36.705 --> 01:39.316
The Glenn is still underwater,
the South and West Basin

01:39.360 --> 01:41.492
are drenched and anything within

01:41.536 --> 01:43.538
a hundred yards of the river
is out of commission.

01:43.581 --> 01:44.539
SARAH:
The high school, clinic,

01:44.582 --> 01:46.497
priorities one and two.

01:46.541 --> 01:48.325
Tyler, have you spoken
to Principal Asadi?

01:48.369 --> 01:49.848
He shouldn't be
speaking to anyone.

01:49.892 --> 01:53.678
Maya chose him as her proxy
while she's in L.A., Liz.

01:53.722 --> 01:54.723
Get over it.

01:54.766 --> 01:55.811
Oh, so that's just
how that works?

01:55.854 --> 01:56.986
Fernsby, get over it.Get over it.

01:57.029 --> 01:59.162
Seriously.Get over it!

01:59.206 --> 02:01.991
Seriously.The high school is still wet.

02:02.034 --> 02:03.906
The principal's working out
deals to hold classes

02:03.949 --> 02:05.386
in other places
until it dries out.

02:05.429 --> 02:06.778
What about the clinic?LIZ:
Still wet.

02:06.822 --> 02:08.432
As is all the equipment inside.

02:08.476 --> 02:11.740
The heart monitors, X-ray
machine, MRI, all of it gone.

02:11.783 --> 02:13.785
That sounds like
an expensive problem.

02:13.829 --> 02:15.526
SARAH:Yeah, good thing we're
sitting on a very valuable

02:15.570 --> 02:16.832
mineral deposit.

02:16.875 --> 02:18.442
How close are we
to the first batch of coltan

02:18.486 --> 02:19.878
coming out of
the ground?It's happening as we speak.

02:19.922 --> 02:21.532
I'll have a better update
when we meet again tonight.

02:21.576 --> 02:24.144
Okay. We'll hit the gas
on repairs as soon as revenue

02:24.187 --> 02:25.667
starts flowing.
In the meantime,

02:25.710 --> 02:26.885
we need to stay focused
on getting

02:26.929 --> 02:29.018
official recognition
from the U.S.

02:29.061 --> 02:31.803
Even wealthy countries rely on
their allies in times of crisis.

02:31.847 --> 02:33.675
We have to be able
to do the same

02:33.718 --> 02:35.981
if we're gonna
survive long-term.

02:36.025 --> 02:38.027
â™ª

02:42.031 --> 02:44.947
Hornets beat the Knicks.
What else is new?

02:44.990 --> 02:47.384
Wizards over the Nuggets-- oh,
I bet that makes you feel happy,

02:47.428 --> 02:49.430
Mr. J, being a Baltimore man.

02:49.473 --> 02:52.215
And there's the grand prize,
Celtics over the Lakers,

02:52.259 --> 02:53.956
113-97.

02:53.999 --> 02:54.739
There we go.

02:54.783 --> 02:56.263
Easy. We had an off night.

02:56.306 --> 02:57.916
She's a sweet girl,
your daughter,

02:57.960 --> 02:59.048
but misguided, you know?

02:59.091 --> 03:01.311
To root for the
Lakers? Come on, AJ.

03:01.355 --> 03:02.965
All right, you three.
It's time for lunch.

03:03.008 --> 03:04.314
It's Milkshake Monday.

03:04.358 --> 03:05.968
Oh, Milkshake Monday?

03:06.011 --> 03:07.622
You sure are getting
spoiled, Dad.

03:07.665 --> 03:10.451
Not for much longer.

03:10.494 --> 03:13.236
Rumor is MediCo
is trying to buy this place.

03:13.280 --> 03:14.542
What's MediCo?

03:14.585 --> 03:15.804
It's a health care conglomerate.

03:15.847 --> 03:18.285
They buy up hospitals,
then they cut costs

03:18.328 --> 03:19.634
and jack up
the prices.

03:19.677 --> 03:21.026
It's disgraceful.

03:21.070 --> 03:22.376
I-I'm on a budget, Gloria.

03:22.419 --> 03:24.160
What happens if, you know,

03:24.204 --> 03:25.335
if I can't cover the new rates?

03:25.379 --> 03:26.554
[exhales]
Don't ask me.

03:26.597 --> 03:29.296
I do milkshakes,
not balance sheets.

03:33.474 --> 03:34.779
Thank you all
for staying so focused

03:34.823 --> 03:36.390
during the flood repairs.

03:36.433 --> 03:38.392
Everything should be dried out
in the next few weeks.

03:38.435 --> 03:40.698
But until then, we're gonna be
using spaces all over town

03:40.742 --> 03:42.047
to hold class.

03:42.091 --> 03:43.397
Yeah, it smells
like feet in here.

03:43.440 --> 03:44.398
Well, maybe tomorrow
you should consider

03:44.441 --> 03:45.616
wearing clean socks, Hunter.

03:45.660 --> 03:47.749
[laughter]Okay, so,

03:47.792 --> 03:50.404
despite all the changes,
we are gonna continue forward

03:50.447 --> 03:52.580
with our sophomore
study project.

03:52.623 --> 03:55.322
So you can create your
own independent project

03:55.365 --> 03:56.932
in any area you'd like.

03:56.975 --> 03:59.804
Can it be something art-related?

03:59.848 --> 04:00.979
Mm-hmm.

04:01.023 --> 04:02.633
As long as it has literary value

04:02.677 --> 04:04.592
and you submit a project
at the end of three weeks.

04:04.635 --> 04:06.028
So we can be flexible?

04:06.071 --> 04:07.595
Yes. You can be flexible.

04:07.638 --> 04:09.423
Thank you.You guys, this is your chance

04:09.466 --> 04:11.903
to create your own
curriculum, so dream big.

04:14.906 --> 04:17.605
Here's the bag
you left in the garage.

04:17.648 --> 04:19.694
You know,
I could've come and got it.

04:19.737 --> 04:21.304
I don't want you in my house.

04:21.348 --> 04:24.655
[chuckles]
Nothing changes, does it?

04:24.699 --> 04:25.961
Tell me about it.

04:26.004 --> 04:27.963
You leave Greylock
because your life

04:28.006 --> 04:29.791
is more important
than everybody else's,

04:29.834 --> 04:33.055
and then you come back
two decades later,

04:33.098 --> 04:34.970
for exactly the same reason.

04:35.013 --> 04:36.450
I came back to see my kids.

04:36.493 --> 04:37.755
Oh, really?
Did you finally get bored

04:37.799 --> 04:39.322
of running from them?

04:39.366 --> 04:41.803
I wasn't running away from them.

04:41.846 --> 04:43.413
And from what
I understand,

04:43.457 --> 04:45.937
I'm not the only one
who was running from you.

04:45.981 --> 04:49.680
Be careful. It's a long fall
from up on that high horse.

04:49.724 --> 04:50.986
I'm sure it does seem high,

04:51.029 --> 04:52.814
from down in the ditches
where you've been.

04:52.857 --> 04:55.120
Oh. Well,
from where I'm standing,

04:55.164 --> 04:59.908
I'm looking at a very selfish,
cowardly, poor excuse for a man.

04:59.951 --> 05:01.866
You just hop right back up
on that bike

05:01.910 --> 05:03.738
and take off
like it was yesterday.Last time I checked,

05:03.781 --> 05:04.913
I think you're the one
that took off.

05:04.956 --> 05:06.175
Can't imagine why.

05:06.218 --> 05:07.829
Everything bad that happened
once you were gone

05:07.872 --> 05:10.179
was because you were gone!

05:10.222 --> 05:14.270
So what you did was my fault?

05:14.314 --> 05:16.316
You're unbelievable.

05:21.712 --> 05:25.194
DANNY:
I have good news
and better news.

05:25.237 --> 05:27.283
The good news is, the first
batch of coltan is here.

05:27.327 --> 05:30.373
Tomorrow, we'll start processing
it into metallic tantalum.

05:30.417 --> 05:32.201
Less geology, more economics.

05:32.244 --> 05:34.203
That is the better news.

05:34.246 --> 05:36.684
The global price
of coltan jumped

05:36.727 --> 05:40.122
this past week thanks
to a military coup in the Congo.

05:40.165 --> 05:42.385
Well, let's make not give thanks
for a military coup?

05:42.429 --> 05:44.387
The coltan is worth more
than the market rate?

05:44.431 --> 05:46.258
We're gonna get a bump
on this first batch.

05:46.302 --> 05:48.391
How much of a bump
are we talking here?

05:48.435 --> 05:51.438
$52 million more
than we were expecting.[all gasping]

05:51.481 --> 05:53.091
And given
Sarah's deal with Lydon

05:53.135 --> 05:55.877
promises two-thirds of all
profits back to the town,

05:55.920 --> 05:57.705
which means Greylock stands
to make an extra...

05:57.748 --> 05:58.836
$35 million.

05:58.880 --> 06:00.534
What are we gonna do
with all that money?

06:00.577 --> 06:02.840
$35 million spent the
right way gets Greylock

06:02.884 --> 06:04.842
a new high school
and a new clinic.

06:04.886 --> 06:07.018
Two birds,
one super valuable stone.

06:07.062 --> 06:08.411
Hold on, the people of
Greylock, they went

06:08.455 --> 06:09.456
through a lot because
of this coltan.

06:09.499 --> 06:11.109
They deserve a
share of the spoils.

06:11.153 --> 06:12.807
This kind of money's
life-changing.

06:12.850 --> 06:15.810
Look, the population
of Greylock is what? 2,700.SARAH: 2,700.

06:15.853 --> 06:20.510
Divide $35 million by 2,700,
is about $13,000 per person.

06:20.554 --> 06:23.600
Barely enough to buy
a new car, so...

06:23.644 --> 06:25.210
to call it life-changing
is a little far-fetched.

06:25.254 --> 06:27.212
LIZ:
Whoa.For you, Mr. Manhattan address.

06:27.256 --> 06:28.953
Okay, look, hand this money out,

06:28.997 --> 06:30.215
and it's just a bunch
of raindrops.

06:30.259 --> 06:32.740
But pool it together,
and we can actually

06:32.783 --> 06:34.176
get real change in Greylock.

06:34.219 --> 06:36.308
I mean, t-those raindrops
become a flood.

06:36.352 --> 06:37.919
Wrong analogy,
considering the circumstances.Sure.

06:37.962 --> 06:39.050
Look, if we start handing out
stimulus checks,

06:39.094 --> 06:40.225
everyone's gonna spend
that money

06:40.269 --> 06:41.662
outside of Greylock.

06:41.705 --> 06:43.054
Wh-- If we hand out
stimulus checks,

06:43.098 --> 06:44.229
everyone's gonna spend
that money

06:44.273 --> 06:45.622
however they damn well please.

06:45.666 --> 06:47.145
Can we just pause for a second
and take a vote?

06:47.189 --> 06:48.712
Who wants
infrastructure?

06:48.756 --> 06:51.106
And who wants stimulus?

06:53.848 --> 06:56.894
DANNY:
Two to two.
You're the tie break, sis.

06:56.938 --> 06:58.287
Of course.

07:08.384 --> 07:10.908
[knocking on door]Hey.

07:10.952 --> 07:12.562
What're you doing here?

07:12.606 --> 07:14.477
Did Adam change his mind
about you being my friend?

07:15.522 --> 07:16.697
[clears throat]

07:16.740 --> 07:19.961
I'm not here
as your friend, Sarah.

07:20.004 --> 07:21.832
I'm here as a teacher.

07:22.964 --> 07:25.836
I know, I know, I'm sorry,
I hate it, too.

07:26.837 --> 07:29.492
Okay. Let's hear it.

07:29.536 --> 07:32.843
So, um, I know that the council
is talking about

07:32.887 --> 07:34.366
what to do with the surplus.

07:34.410 --> 07:35.672
Sarah,

07:35.716 --> 07:36.804
you have to invest it
in the school system.

07:36.847 --> 07:38.327
That option is already
on the table.

07:38.370 --> 07:40.460
I don't want it on the table.
I want it in the budget.

07:42.549 --> 07:46.248
Sarah, our school was struggling
before the flood, but now?

07:46.291 --> 07:48.163
The few resources we do have
are laughable.

07:49.207 --> 07:52.820
Rumor is, Principal Asadi is
retiring at the end of the year.

07:52.863 --> 07:54.517
I'm gonna throw my
hat into the ring.

07:54.561 --> 07:57.346
Running for the Greylock council
showed me that...

07:57.389 --> 07:58.826
maybe I can do big things.

07:58.869 --> 08:00.480
I want to put
Greylock on the map

08:00.523 --> 08:04.048
as the most progressive
school district in the world.

08:04.092 --> 08:06.094
But I can't do that
if we aren't properly funded.

08:06.137 --> 08:07.487
I know

08:07.530 --> 08:10.272
that you're still
a teacher on the inside,

08:10.315 --> 08:12.970
no matter what you
are on the outside.

08:13.014 --> 08:15.320
And teachers always put
their students first.

08:15.364 --> 08:17.018
Always.

08:19.803 --> 08:21.892
[door opens, closes]

08:21.936 --> 08:25.896
How about a dogs-only
production of A Winter's Tail?

08:27.332 --> 08:29.944
Get it? T-A-I-L?

08:29.987 --> 08:30.945
I get it.

08:30.988 --> 08:32.163
Tito can be the lead.

08:32.207 --> 08:34.296
That's-that's an A-plus
idea right there.

08:34.339 --> 08:36.951
Look, the project
needs to have literary value.

08:36.994 --> 08:38.605
I can't just dress up
a bunch of beagles

08:38.648 --> 08:40.650
in Elizabethan ruffs
and call it a day.

08:40.694 --> 08:43.131
Elizabethan ruffs?
That's-that's funny.

08:43.174 --> 08:44.436
Like, "Ruff, ruff."

08:44.480 --> 08:46.221
Ruff, ruff.

08:46.264 --> 08:47.396
Swipe left.

08:47.439 --> 08:48.615
Oh, okay.

08:48.658 --> 08:50.094
No, seriously, Ty. Thank you.

08:50.138 --> 08:51.574
Thank you for helping me out
moving into this new place.

08:51.618 --> 08:54.708
This whole thing goes
a lot faster with two people.

08:57.624 --> 08:58.929
Whoa, is this eight-millimeter?

08:58.973 --> 09:00.714
I didn't know
you were into film.

09:00.757 --> 09:03.630
Oh, that belonged to Patience.
Uh, she carried that everywhere.

09:03.673 --> 09:07.590
You could borrow
it if you like.

09:07.634 --> 09:08.852
The camera bag
has film and filters.

09:08.896 --> 09:10.593
Use whatever's in there.

09:10.637 --> 09:13.814
Are you sure? I mean, this
is your wife's special thing.

09:13.857 --> 09:15.119
I don't...No, no, I'm sure.

09:15.163 --> 09:16.860
Therapy's going well,
I'm in a better place.

09:16.904 --> 09:19.559
Camera is all, it's all yours.

09:27.436 --> 09:30.091
Well, it's official. MediCo
is buying my dad's facility.

09:30.134 --> 09:32.441
I thought it was just a rumor.[sighs] It was,

09:32.484 --> 09:35.139
but the CEO just confirmed it
in an interview.

09:35.183 --> 09:36.314
This is a nightmare.

09:36.358 --> 09:38.447
I did some digging on MediCo.

09:38.490 --> 09:40.536
Every hospital they've bought,
they've raised the cost.

09:40.580 --> 09:42.320
Okay, so move your dad
somewhere else.

09:42.364 --> 09:44.279
Places that cater to patients
like my dad,

09:44.322 --> 09:46.455
they're few and far between.

09:46.498 --> 09:48.283
Where's the next nearest one?

09:48.326 --> 09:50.807
Cape Cod.

09:50.851 --> 09:52.243
And there's no way I can
let him be six hours away.

09:52.287 --> 09:54.898
If he moves...

09:54.942 --> 09:57.335
I'd have to move with him.

09:58.467 --> 09:59.947
Well, I've been in
a good place lately.

09:59.990 --> 10:03.124
It's just... your father,
he gets to me.

10:03.167 --> 10:04.429
I know the feeling.

10:04.473 --> 10:06.214
Well, I saw him yesterday
and he brought up

10:06.257 --> 10:08.433
some of my more difficult
moments with Danny.

10:08.477 --> 10:10.174
[sighs]

10:10.218 --> 10:12.350
And as we-- as we talked...

10:12.394 --> 10:14.918
What? What'd he do?It's what he won't do.

10:14.962 --> 10:17.791
He refuses to acknowledge

10:17.834 --> 10:20.271
any damage that he has
caused this family.

10:20.315 --> 10:22.752
We've all caused
our fair share, Mom.

10:22.796 --> 10:24.493
Yes, I understand that I did
the most terrible thing.

10:24.536 --> 10:26.887
At least I'm trying
to face my faults.

10:26.930 --> 10:28.758
He is completely
ignoring the fact

10:28.802 --> 10:30.760
that when you walk
out on your family,

10:30.804 --> 10:32.370
you actually leave
them with damage.

10:34.242 --> 10:36.026
I'm really proud of the progress

10:36.070 --> 10:37.332
that you have made
in this program,

10:37.375 --> 10:38.768
but none of it
is gonna be permanent

10:38.812 --> 10:40.944
unless you can accept
that the root cause

10:40.988 --> 10:43.947
of your bad behavior
wasn't Paul,

10:43.991 --> 10:46.036
or Danny or me.

10:46.080 --> 10:48.299
There's always gonna be
someone else to blame.

10:48.343 --> 10:49.779
But if you do that,
you're never gonna confront

10:49.823 --> 10:51.302
your part
in your own failures.

10:51.346 --> 10:54.262
And if you can't acknowledge it,
you can't fix it, Mom.

10:58.353 --> 11:00.355
I know that marriage
counseling is super weird.

11:01.486 --> 11:03.227
And I know that we
have a long way to go

11:03.271 --> 11:04.968
before we feel like...

11:05.012 --> 11:07.144
us again but...

11:07.188 --> 11:09.190
this is really nice.

11:09.233 --> 11:11.061
Yeah.

11:11.105 --> 11:12.933
It was a, it was a great idea.

11:14.543 --> 11:16.371
Hey, could I get
another vodka tonic from you?

11:17.851 --> 11:19.591
Thanks.

11:19.635 --> 11:22.856
Well, I am gonna go...
powder my nose.

11:22.899 --> 11:25.206
So I can look cute
for my perfect husband.

11:31.212 --> 11:32.996
This place is great.

11:33.040 --> 11:35.042
GROVER:
Yeah. Yeah. Right?

11:35.085 --> 11:37.218
[indistinct chatter]

11:39.220 --> 11:41.483
I told you.

11:41.526 --> 11:44.181
Can I get two double
whiskeys neat?

11:47.619 --> 11:49.491
Adam. Hey, man.

11:49.534 --> 11:51.275
How you doing?

11:51.319 --> 11:53.321
Been better.

11:53.364 --> 11:56.063
Super Cooper here dropped
an A-bomb into my life.

11:56.106 --> 11:58.935
Maybe we should head
someplace else.Yeah.

11:58.979 --> 12:00.894
Yeah, yeah,
y-you would want to leave.

12:02.069 --> 12:03.897
That's Danny Cooper's
go-to move, isn't it?

12:03.940 --> 12:05.202
Oh, Adam, Adam, come on.
Okay, hey, Adam...

12:05.246 --> 12:06.987
What, am I wrong?

12:07.030 --> 12:09.859
This is the guy
who left his whole family

12:09.903 --> 12:12.644
and his girlfriend
without saying a goodbye.

12:12.688 --> 12:14.908
Then he turns around
and does the exact same thing

12:14.951 --> 12:16.823
to his fiancÃ©e.

12:16.866 --> 12:18.389
Boy, you're really

12:18.433 --> 12:21.305
batting a thousand, aren't you?Don't go there.

12:21.349 --> 12:22.524
Piper, right?

12:22.567 --> 12:23.786
It's a tough beat.

12:23.830 --> 12:27.311
She probably had no idea
you didn't love her.

12:28.748 --> 12:31.359
Hell, you probably never did.

12:35.319 --> 12:37.278
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
Okay, okay, okay, okay!

12:37.321 --> 12:39.541
Stop, stop. Walk it off,
walk it off, Danny. Go, go.

12:39.584 --> 12:41.848
Calm down. No,
calm down, Danny.

13:04.435 --> 13:05.785
â™ª

13:13.140 --> 13:15.142
[line ringing]

13:16.360 --> 13:18.101
[door opens]Oh, thank God.

13:18.145 --> 13:19.755
Thank God.
Where have you been?

13:19.799 --> 13:21.844
One minute we were, we were
sitting, we were having dinner,

13:21.888 --> 13:24.064
and it was really nice, and the
next, you were just gone and...

13:24.107 --> 13:27.458
I thought
that we were doing better.

13:27.502 --> 13:29.852
We were.

13:29.896 --> 13:32.072
Until I saw this.

13:32.115 --> 13:34.901
It fell out of Danny's pocket
at the bar.

13:36.032 --> 13:37.512
Recognize it?

13:38.992 --> 13:40.254
No?

13:40.297 --> 13:42.125
Here, let me jog your memory.

13:42.169 --> 13:43.257
Adam...

13:44.780 --> 13:46.782
â™ª Our hearts beat...

13:46.826 --> 13:49.132
Why do you and Danny

13:49.176 --> 13:51.656
both have these?

13:51.700 --> 13:53.876
Corinne.

13:53.920 --> 13:56.357
Answer me.

13:59.316 --> 14:00.840
You're still in love with him.

14:00.883 --> 14:03.407
â™ª Pain in my chest
is burning... â™ª

14:03.451 --> 14:05.757
I'm trying really hard
not to be.

14:05.801 --> 14:07.847
Get out.

14:07.890 --> 14:09.283
Adam, listen, I...

14:09.326 --> 14:11.285
Just get out.

14:12.286 --> 14:15.419
â™ª To the boy

14:15.463 --> 14:19.162
â™ª In the winter's

14:19.206 --> 14:21.861
â™ª Cold.

14:28.693 --> 14:30.347
Hi, Bella.

14:30.391 --> 14:32.175
You like so nice.
What's the occasion?

14:32.219 --> 14:33.350
Uh, I have a job interview.

14:33.394 --> 14:35.439
With who?With you.

14:35.483 --> 14:37.702
For my sophomore
study project.

14:37.746 --> 14:38.878
I want to be your intern.

14:38.921 --> 14:41.097
I'll organize
your schedule,

14:41.141 --> 14:42.577
I'll take notes
during your meetings,

14:42.620 --> 14:45.058
I'll do research
and I'll make spreadsheets.

14:45.101 --> 14:46.494
I love spreadsheets, Sarah.

14:46.537 --> 14:48.104
Like, I love them.

14:49.105 --> 14:51.412
Um, I actually,
I-I don't need an intern.

14:51.455 --> 14:53.022
But if you let me help you,

14:53.066 --> 14:55.111
I can write a paper
about what Greylock's doing

14:55.155 --> 14:57.026
and how it compares
to other new nations.

14:57.070 --> 14:58.941
Mm-hmm.

14:58.985 --> 15:01.422
Please, Sarah.

15:01.465 --> 15:02.989
I'll do whatever you ask.

15:03.032 --> 15:05.600
I'll... sweep the floor

15:05.643 --> 15:07.558
if you want me to.

15:07.602 --> 15:09.517
I just want to help.

15:10.648 --> 15:12.085
Okay, you're hired.

15:12.128 --> 15:14.304
Wait, really, you're serious?Yeah, I'm serious.

15:14.348 --> 15:16.437
I've been telling the council
lately if there's one thing

15:16.480 --> 15:18.308
we need more of,
it's spreadsheets.

15:18.352 --> 15:20.876
So thank you.[laughs] Okay.

15:22.443 --> 15:24.358
We need to talk.

15:24.401 --> 15:27.317
Oh, okay, yes, fine.

15:27.361 --> 15:29.493
It was me-- I'm so sorry
I ate your last

15:29.537 --> 15:31.974
yogurt pack,
but the blackberry is so good.

15:32.018 --> 15:33.323
This is not about you

15:33.367 --> 15:34.672
stealing my food, Sarah.
This is about the coltan.

15:34.716 --> 15:36.239
Oh, okay, that I can handle.

15:36.283 --> 15:37.632
So I really think
we need to be putting

15:37.675 --> 15:39.025
this money
into people's pockets.

15:39.068 --> 15:40.548
Yeah, I'm working on it, AJ.

15:40.591 --> 15:43.203
I want to be sure I've thought
it through before I vote.

15:43.246 --> 15:44.769
I-I understand what's at stake.

15:44.813 --> 15:47.076
Do you? Because what's at stake
for me is a lot bigger.

15:47.120 --> 15:48.295
What do you mean?

15:51.080 --> 15:54.040
My dad is not at a rest home.

15:55.519 --> 15:57.347
He's at a facility

15:57.391 --> 15:59.262
that specializes
in brain injuries.

15:59.306 --> 16:01.656
Brain injuries?

16:01.699 --> 16:03.614
Yeah.

16:03.658 --> 16:05.355
He has what they call

16:05.399 --> 16:07.270
primary CNS vasculitis.

16:07.314 --> 16:09.794
Wiped out half his brain
functions in one fell swoop.

16:09.838 --> 16:11.709
AJ, I'm so sorry.
Why didn't you tell me?

16:13.320 --> 16:15.017
Let's just say pity gets old.

16:15.061 --> 16:17.367
Listen.

16:17.411 --> 16:19.021
If I don't get the extra cash,

16:19.065 --> 16:21.284
I'm gonna have to move
my dad to someplace new.

16:21.328 --> 16:24.070
And I really don't
want to do that.

16:25.593 --> 16:27.421
After everything that the
universe has stolen from him,

16:27.464 --> 16:29.162
I can't take this, too.

16:29.205 --> 16:31.468
Your brother may not think
that 13 grand's a lot.

16:31.512 --> 16:34.036
But for a lot of people,

16:34.080 --> 16:36.038
that money could
change their lives.

16:36.082 --> 16:38.040
I know it would
change mine.

16:38.084 --> 16:41.174
I could keep my dad where
he is for another year.

16:41.217 --> 16:42.392
Just give me some time
to figure out

16:42.436 --> 16:44.307
how to keep paying for things.

16:45.656 --> 16:48.050
I've never asked you
for anything, Sarah.

16:48.094 --> 16:49.747
Never, not once.

16:51.314 --> 16:53.186
But...

16:53.229 --> 16:55.057
I got to ask for this.

16:55.101 --> 16:57.103
Please.

16:59.235 --> 17:01.324
So does that mean you're,
like, Sarah's assistant now?

17:01.368 --> 17:03.152
That's the idea,
yeah.

17:03.196 --> 17:05.372
I'm gonna organize stuff
for her, help her out.

17:05.415 --> 17:07.722
And then for my SSP paper,

17:07.765 --> 17:10.638
I can write about
nation-building and democracy,

17:10.681 --> 17:13.423
and Greylock can be
my case study.

17:13.467 --> 17:15.164
That's dope.

17:16.557 --> 17:18.385
[camera clicking]

17:18.428 --> 17:20.865
So, uh, where do you get film
for something like that?

17:20.909 --> 17:22.737
Grover did say there's
tons of stuff in the bag.

17:22.780 --> 17:25.261
So maybe there's, like, some
undeveloped film or something.

17:25.305 --> 17:28.308
Oh, yeah, there's
a ton of stuff in here.

17:28.351 --> 17:30.484
"June 2016.

17:30.527 --> 17:32.529
March 2017."

17:32.573 --> 17:34.836
Wait, are these, like,
home movies?

17:34.879 --> 17:38.492
Um, I don't know, I haven't
really looked at 'em.

17:38.535 --> 17:40.450
Wait, what if these are

17:40.494 --> 17:42.452
from him and Patience?

17:42.496 --> 17:45.194
Well, he did say that

17:45.238 --> 17:46.761
his therapy's
going super well

17:46.804 --> 17:48.806
and that I could use
anything in the bag, so...

17:48.850 --> 17:50.373
Okay.

17:51.548 --> 17:53.289
I need your help.

17:53.333 --> 17:55.465
As you've probably heard by now,

17:55.509 --> 17:57.554
Greylock has a budget surplus.

17:57.598 --> 18:00.514
What to do with that money is
a very complicated issue.

18:00.557 --> 18:02.603
It's one that will affect
all of us.

18:02.646 --> 18:04.822
So I figured
it was time for all of us

18:04.866 --> 18:06.607
to have a say in the matter.

18:06.650 --> 18:08.696
Tomorrow at Town Hall,
there will be a ballot box

18:08.739 --> 18:12.134
where every citizen may submit
a vote on the debate.

18:12.178 --> 18:16.225
Do we pool the coltan money
and reinvest it?

18:16.269 --> 18:18.793
Or do we divide it up
and dole it out?

18:18.836 --> 18:21.970
The individual or the
collective: that's the question.

18:23.841 --> 18:25.147
Adam?

18:28.672 --> 18:30.805
Josh?

18:30.848 --> 18:32.807
Mommy's home...

18:32.850 --> 18:34.852
from Nana and Papa's.

18:46.516 --> 18:48.518
Hello?

18:54.220 --> 18:55.699
[clears throat]

18:55.743 --> 18:57.962
[line ringing]

18:58.006 --> 19:01.270
Adam? I, um, I just got home
from my parents'

19:01.314 --> 19:02.445
and the house is empty.

19:02.489 --> 19:05.492
So... where are you?

19:05.535 --> 19:07.363
Halfway to Philadelphia.

19:07.407 --> 19:08.712
What?

19:08.756 --> 19:10.671
I'm taking Josh
to my brother's place.

19:10.714 --> 19:13.064
You should get divorce papers
later today.

19:14.370 --> 19:16.111
And, Corinne?

19:16.155 --> 19:18.853
I'll be seeking
sole custody of Josh.

19:28.906 --> 19:31.866
â™ª There is something
about your way... â™ª

19:31.909 --> 19:34.042
There you go.

19:34.085 --> 19:35.565
â™ª There is something
about your way â™ª

19:35.609 --> 19:38.046
â™ª There is
something about your way â™ª

19:38.089 --> 19:40.004
â™ª There is something about
your way... â™ª

19:40.048 --> 19:41.615
BELLA:
Thank you.

19:41.658 --> 19:43.834
Yeah, just keep it moving, guys,
thank you.

19:43.878 --> 19:46.446
Yeah, keep going. Thanks.

19:46.489 --> 19:48.796
â™ª About your way
and I just got to say â™ª

19:48.839 --> 19:51.538
â™ª I just got to say

19:51.581 --> 19:52.539
â™ª Hey...

19:52.582 --> 19:54.018
Sarah?
Corinne.

19:54.062 --> 19:55.585
He-he took Josh.

19:58.197 --> 19:59.981
I got the divorce papers
an hour ago and I just wanted

20:00.024 --> 20:01.504
to make sure
that I'm not overreacting.

20:01.548 --> 20:03.724
I mean, I don't understand
why you're not hunting Adam down

20:03.767 --> 20:04.899
like a 12-point buck.

20:04.942 --> 20:07.075
No, right now,
as far as Josh knows,

20:07.118 --> 20:09.643
he's just on a spontaneous
trip to see his cousin.

20:09.686 --> 20:11.166
And I want to keep it that way.

20:11.210 --> 20:13.124
I don't want to saddle him
with a bunch of sad memories

20:13.168 --> 20:15.083
of his parents screaming
at each other on the front lawn.

20:15.126 --> 20:17.781
This whole thing is gonna be
amicable if it kills me.

20:17.825 --> 20:19.087
This is
all pretty standard stuff.

20:19.130 --> 20:20.741
The only twist

20:20.784 --> 20:22.699
is Adam seeking sole custody.

20:22.743 --> 20:24.701
And he's filing
in New Hampshire.

20:24.745 --> 20:26.137
What? Can he do that?

20:26.181 --> 20:28.270
The deed to your house,

20:28.314 --> 20:31.230
your marriage license--
they still say New Hampshire.

20:31.273 --> 20:33.797
He wanted this as far
from Greylock as possible.

20:33.841 --> 20:34.885
To keep it out of my reach.

20:34.929 --> 20:36.800
Not that I could do
much anyways.

20:36.844 --> 20:39.020
Okay.
[chuckles]

20:39.063 --> 20:41.065
I am still Josh's mom.

20:41.109 --> 20:43.198
That has to count for something.

20:43.242 --> 20:45.156
The courts usually decide

20:45.200 --> 20:47.942
in favor of the mother
in cases like this,

20:47.985 --> 20:51.685
especially if the child
is happy and healthy.

20:51.728 --> 20:55.166
And Adam did take Josh across
an international boundary.

20:55.210 --> 20:57.691
It's not illegal for a
spouse to take a child

20:57.734 --> 20:59.301
without permission
if the parents aren't

20:59.345 --> 21:04.175
already involved
in a custody dispute.

21:04.219 --> 21:06.961
But what Adam did
does not look good.

21:07.004 --> 21:11.095
See? We're gonna get Josh
back home in no time, okay?

21:13.576 --> 21:15.317
Hey. I solved it.

21:15.361 --> 21:17.798
Think I know what I'm gonna do
for my sophomore study project.

21:17.841 --> 21:21.105
I'll start learning lines
with Tito for A Winter's Tail.

21:21.149 --> 21:24.370
I'm gonna make Super 8 shorts
about people in Greylock.

21:24.413 --> 21:25.762
I'm gonna string
them all together,

21:25.806 --> 21:27.460
make a documentarymosaic.

21:27.503 --> 21:28.461
I just finished my first one
last night.

21:28.504 --> 21:29.766
Episode one: Grover Sims.

21:29.810 --> 21:32.073
Guy at the camera store
digitized it for me.

21:32.116 --> 21:33.248
How did you make a film
about me?

21:33.292 --> 21:35.250
We didn't even record
any footage.

21:35.294 --> 21:37.992
There was tons of footage
in this bag.

21:38.035 --> 21:39.428
What?Yeah.

21:39.472 --> 21:40.908
Of you and Patience.

21:40.951 --> 21:42.213
I kind of edited it together,
added some music.

21:42.257 --> 21:45.086
You watched our home movies?

21:45.129 --> 21:47.088
I did.

21:47.131 --> 21:50.091
I thought you said I could use
anything in the bag.

21:50.134 --> 21:52.963
Yeah, I didn't know...

21:53.007 --> 21:54.878
I didn't know
those were in there, Tyler.

22:01.407 --> 22:03.365
Look, I-I'm sorry, man.

22:03.409 --> 22:04.758
Don't even worry
about it, Tyler.

22:04.801 --> 22:06.150
Don't even
worry about it.

22:12.113 --> 22:14.115
â™ª

22:18.337 --> 22:19.773
Bella?

22:19.816 --> 22:21.775
You know you...
[clears throat]

22:21.818 --> 22:22.993
You don't have to--
It's-it's not even a referendum.

22:23.037 --> 22:25.300
It's just a poll to help me...

22:25.344 --> 22:27.215
This is history, Sarah.

22:27.258 --> 22:29.217
We have to document it properly.Yes, ma'am.

22:29.260 --> 22:32.394
â™ª Stare while the night's
turning dark â™ª

22:32.438 --> 22:34.831
â™ª And the fire's in your heart

22:34.875 --> 22:38.139
â™ª And you know you should not

22:38.182 --> 22:41.142
â™ª But you can't
help but wonder... â™ª

22:41.185 --> 22:42.448
I'm sorry.

22:43.492 --> 22:45.320
[laughs]:
Oh! Come on.

22:45.364 --> 22:47.453
Really?

22:47.496 --> 22:49.977
PAUL:
The game is called Risk,
not Play it Safe.

22:50.020 --> 22:51.587
SARAH:Words of wisdom
from Paul Cooper.

22:51.631 --> 22:54.590
If I wasn't a wanted man,
I'd start a podcast.

22:54.634 --> 22:56.853
I think I would
subscribe, maybe.[chuckles]

22:58.072 --> 23:01.858
You know...
you have made tougher decisions.

23:01.902 --> 23:03.730
I have faced more
difficult decisions.

23:03.773 --> 23:08.038
I haven't gotten around
to making all of them quite yet.

23:08.082 --> 23:11.607
Mm, the coltan question.Mm.

23:11.651 --> 23:14.088
Welcome to the world
of rich people's problems.

23:14.131 --> 23:16.046
Everyone's been pouring
their hearts out to me,

23:16.090 --> 23:18.048
trying to get me
to come to their side.

23:18.092 --> 23:19.920
I ran a poll

23:19.963 --> 23:21.617
to see how people felt,
thought that would give me

23:21.661 --> 23:23.967
some guidance,
came out dead even.

23:24.011 --> 23:24.620
Dead even.

23:24.664 --> 23:26.492
738 to 738.

23:26.535 --> 23:28.189
Yeah, well, you got to look
at the big picture.

23:28.232 --> 23:32.019
You know, every issue's got
a sad story behind it.

23:32.062 --> 23:35.196
But if you put all your troops
in Siam...

23:35.239 --> 23:36.676
I'm attacking Australia.

23:36.719 --> 23:40.680
You leave your-your northern
border unprotected.

23:40.723 --> 23:42.333
A general's got
to see the whole board.

23:42.377 --> 23:45.206
Can't get caught up in
every little skirmish.

23:45.249 --> 23:49.123
Sometimes you got to lose one
soldier to save a hundred.

23:49.166 --> 23:50.951
Tell that
to the soldier's family.

23:50.994 --> 23:52.300
Yeah, well, that's never easy,

23:52.343 --> 23:53.954
and his sacrifice
shouldn't go ignored.

23:53.997 --> 23:58.741
But at the end of the day,
all of civilized society

23:58.785 --> 24:01.004
is based on a
simple premise:

24:01.048 --> 24:04.834
what's good for the pack
is what's good for the wolf.

24:04.878 --> 24:06.880
Not the other way around.

24:11.319 --> 24:13.321
[exhales]

24:27.857 --> 24:29.032
[laughs softly]

24:33.863 --> 24:35.038
All right.

24:38.825 --> 24:40.174
[whirring]

24:40.217 --> 24:41.915
â™ª I would be

24:41.958 --> 24:44.700
â™ª Your king

24:52.099 --> 24:56.103
â™ª But you want to be free

25:04.285 --> 25:09.508
â™ª Confusion and art

25:20.519 --> 25:25.785
â™ª I'm nothing but heart

25:36.273 --> 25:40.974
â™ª I'm nothing but heart

25:51.854 --> 25:56.467
â™ª I'm nothing but heart

26:07.174 --> 26:10.438
â™ª I'm nothing but heart

26:13.049 --> 26:16.923
â™ª It would behoove us all

26:16.966 --> 26:18.925
â™ª To remember

26:18.968 --> 26:22.189
â™ª That all we are
is what we love â™ª

26:22.232 --> 26:27.934
â™ª I'm nothing but heart

26:27.977 --> 26:31.851
â™ª May we someday be assured

26:31.894 --> 26:36.943
â™ª As we walk into the night

26:36.986 --> 26:39.598
â™ª I'm nothing but heart.

26:56.658 --> 26:58.094
I've made my decision.

26:58.138 --> 27:01.315
What's best for the people
of Greylock

27:01.358 --> 27:04.448
is to reinvest the coltan
surplus in the town.

27:04.492 --> 27:07.060
I know you two were hoping
that I would go a different way,

27:07.103 --> 27:08.409
and I'm sorry.

27:08.452 --> 27:11.499
But your arguments haven't
fallen on deaf ears.

27:11.542 --> 27:13.414
This money should
benefit all of us.

27:13.457 --> 27:15.459
I think I have a way for it
to do just that.

27:15.503 --> 27:17.810
We all know how important it is
for us to get recognized

27:17.853 --> 27:19.333
as a new country.

27:19.376 --> 27:21.552
I thought we were gonna
fix the high school.We are.

27:21.596 --> 27:23.903
Along with the clinic.
In my plan,

27:23.946 --> 27:25.948
they will be
in the same building,

27:25.992 --> 27:28.081
which will give students
who are interested in medicine

27:28.124 --> 27:30.561
a chance to be around doctors
at a young age,

27:30.605 --> 27:32.825
it will give our biology
and health classes

27:32.868 --> 27:34.827
access to a
working infirmary.

27:34.870 --> 27:37.438
You can't have a hospital
inside of a high school.

27:37.481 --> 27:39.005
Why not?

27:39.048 --> 27:40.833
The Millbrook School in Upstate
New York has a zoo in it.

27:40.876 --> 27:42.051
Students learn about zoology

27:42.095 --> 27:43.705
while they take care
of the animals.

27:43.749 --> 27:45.228
Grand Rapids, Michigan
has a program

27:45.272 --> 27:47.796
where they send kids
to school at a museum.

27:47.840 --> 27:52.018
This is our chance
to do something unique

27:52.061 --> 27:53.236
and challenging
for our kids.

27:53.280 --> 27:54.368
The money
that we will save,

27:54.411 --> 27:57.240
by turning
two buildings into one,

27:57.284 --> 27:59.416
we're gonna use to connect
with our neighbors.

27:59.460 --> 28:02.724
Creating business partnerships,
linking our public transit

28:02.768 --> 28:04.247
with nearby towns.

28:04.291 --> 28:06.249
The fastest route to recognition

28:06.293 --> 28:09.339
is to show the world that we are
worthy of their friendship.

28:09.383 --> 28:10.514
And in order to do that,

28:10.558 --> 28:12.081
we got to start
being friendly.

28:12.125 --> 28:13.256
So what happens next?

28:13.300 --> 28:17.739
After you all weigh in
on my plan,

28:17.783 --> 28:20.786
I will present the final version
to the town.

28:20.829 --> 28:23.223
It'll be Greylock's
coming out party.

28:23.266 --> 28:24.920
If that goes well,

28:24.964 --> 28:28.968
we will have taken a very
solid step towards recognition.

28:30.970 --> 28:32.319
[knocking on door]

28:38.891 --> 28:41.371
Two minutes.
That's all I need.

28:41.415 --> 28:43.591
I want to apologize.

28:48.335 --> 28:50.772
[scoffs]

28:50.816 --> 28:53.340
Look, the mistakes
that I made...

28:56.822 --> 28:59.085
The way that I hurt Danny...

29:00.129 --> 29:02.131
None of that is your fault.

29:03.176 --> 29:04.830
That's mine.

29:05.831 --> 29:09.835
I probably don't have
to tell you how much...

29:11.053 --> 29:13.012
...I regret leaving

29:13.055 --> 29:15.231
the way I did.

29:15.275 --> 29:17.930
Walking out on everybody.

29:17.973 --> 29:19.322
["Gloria" by Henry Jamison
playing]

29:19.366 --> 29:21.977
Should've been there
for the kids.

29:22.021 --> 29:23.805
For you.

29:23.849 --> 29:25.981
I may not have been the one
to push you over the edge,

29:26.025 --> 29:29.158
but I sure as hell wasn't there
to catch you when you fell.

29:31.639 --> 29:34.598
Well, we're not
the greatest parents, are we?

29:34.642 --> 29:37.471
Definitely room for improvement.

29:38.515 --> 29:40.300
[chuckles softly]

29:40.343 --> 29:44.521
So, uh, how are
you holding up?

29:44.565 --> 29:46.828
Thought that the bags
under my eyes

29:46.872 --> 29:49.004
and the vintage loungewear
made it obvious, but...

29:49.048 --> 29:51.180
Is it safe to talk in here?

29:51.224 --> 29:52.312
That's not funny.

29:52.355 --> 29:53.574
Sorry. Had to do something

29:53.617 --> 29:55.010
with my nervous energy.

29:55.054 --> 29:57.360
So, um...
[clears throat]

29:57.404 --> 30:01.538
Sarah told me you're, uh,
struggling to find a lawyer

30:01.582 --> 30:03.062
for the custody hearing.

30:04.063 --> 30:05.325
Francesca Smith.

30:05.368 --> 30:07.849
Barred in New Hampshire
and a total badass.

30:07.893 --> 30:09.198
I went to law
school with her.

30:09.242 --> 30:10.939
She's based out
of New York.

30:10.983 --> 30:12.245
I figured you'd want the best.

30:12.288 --> 30:14.551
This address. I already know

30:14.595 --> 30:16.162
that I can't
afford her, so...

30:16.205 --> 30:17.859
I'll cover it. She's gonna
help you get Josh back,

30:17.903 --> 30:19.992
Corinne. It's for him.

30:20.035 --> 30:21.210
â™ª Looking
for your worthiness... â™ª

30:21.254 --> 30:24.257
Please, just let me help.

30:25.258 --> 30:26.912
Fine.

30:28.435 --> 30:30.872
Thank you.

30:30.916 --> 30:33.440
But this is a loan, not a gift.

30:38.706 --> 30:43.232
â™ª Me and my cousin
were at the arcade â™ª

30:43.276 --> 30:45.495
â™ª In a fathom of blood...

30:45.539 --> 30:47.541
TYLER:
Sorry about
the whole film thing.

30:47.584 --> 30:49.282
I'm the one that should
be apologizing to you.

30:50.587 --> 30:52.546
It's my bad.

30:52.589 --> 30:54.548
I can't get upset at you
for doing something

30:54.591 --> 30:56.071
that I said you could do.

30:56.115 --> 30:57.899
So it's...

30:57.943 --> 30:59.379
I'm sorry.

31:00.423 --> 31:02.034
Okay?

31:02.077 --> 31:05.124
You know, I watched the film you
made about me and Patience, man.

31:05.167 --> 31:07.300
â™ª With a coat and a cane...

31:07.343 --> 31:09.345
I wasn't expecting it
to bring back

31:09.389 --> 31:11.391
so many of those good memories.

31:11.434 --> 31:12.653
So thank you.

31:12.696 --> 31:13.959
â™ª The world gone insane...

31:14.002 --> 31:16.918
You've got a gift, man.

31:16.962 --> 31:20.095
One that I think you need
to consider indulging.

31:20.139 --> 31:21.923
Which is why...

31:21.967 --> 31:23.533
this belongs
to you now.

31:23.577 --> 31:25.231
For good.

31:25.274 --> 31:27.189
You sure?

31:27.233 --> 31:28.625
Yeah.

31:28.669 --> 31:32.107
Patience would be ecstatic
to know that someone...

31:32.151 --> 31:35.110
actually appreciates
her camera, so...

31:35.154 --> 31:37.156
yeah, it's yours.

31:38.331 --> 31:39.462
â™ª Gloria...

31:39.506 --> 31:41.247
Thanks, man.

31:41.290 --> 31:43.423
No. Thank you, Ty.

31:43.466 --> 31:46.426
â™ª Or a lack of love...

31:46.469 --> 31:47.514
Oh, my God.

31:47.557 --> 31:49.385
Your mom had a
dress like that.

31:49.429 --> 31:51.431
It was half the reason she got
pregnant with Danny, was...

31:51.474 --> 31:53.128
Ew, gross.

31:53.172 --> 31:54.695
Oh.Stop.

31:54.738 --> 31:57.741
Sorry. Look, y-you're gonna
look presidential and great

31:57.785 --> 32:00.092
in anything, Princess.Don't call me Princess.

32:00.135 --> 32:01.963
Please don't call me
Princess.

32:03.704 --> 32:06.794
I guess this is what it's like
to have a...

32:06.837 --> 32:08.970
a you in my life.

32:09.014 --> 32:10.711
A stylist?

32:12.713 --> 32:14.976
Have you thought more
about where you're gonna live?

32:15.020 --> 32:18.110
I was checking out some rentals
over on the north side.

32:18.153 --> 32:19.850
What about work?

32:19.894 --> 32:21.983
Might go back into contracting.

32:22.027 --> 32:24.246
You know, outside,
sun on your face.

32:24.290 --> 32:26.640
Finish a job, you actually
got something to show for it.

32:26.683 --> 32:28.163
I get that.

32:28.207 --> 32:32.515
It's so weird to think of you
being here long-term.

32:32.559 --> 32:36.345
When I was younger,
I had a picture in my mind

32:36.389 --> 32:38.434
of what my life
could look like.

32:38.478 --> 32:39.653
You were never in it.

32:40.697 --> 32:41.829
And now I am?

32:41.872 --> 32:43.352
You're starting to be.

32:43.396 --> 32:45.615
Yeah.Is that a good thing?

32:45.659 --> 32:47.704
It's a prettier picture now.

32:47.748 --> 32:49.532
â™ª To face your father.

32:51.404 --> 32:53.406
â™ª

32:54.842 --> 32:56.104
Hi.

32:58.889 --> 33:00.239
Hey, Sarah.Hi.

33:00.282 --> 33:02.284
Here's this.Okay. Yeah.

33:02.328 --> 33:04.156
Chin up, 'cause I got to put
your mic on.

33:04.199 --> 33:06.810
The soundboard is
way up in the balcony

33:06.854 --> 33:08.290
if you need to signal
for more volume

33:08.334 --> 33:10.771
in your stage monitor.Okay.

33:10.814 --> 33:12.903
And all your notes
are in there.

33:12.947 --> 33:14.470
There's also a seating chart,
so you know

33:14.514 --> 33:16.429
where the most important people
are in the audience.

33:16.472 --> 33:18.605
There's gonna be mayors,
some selectmen

33:18.648 --> 33:20.172
and a few state senators.

33:20.215 --> 33:21.564
There's also, like,
a dozen journalists,

33:21.608 --> 33:22.826
including one
from The Boston Globe.

33:22.870 --> 33:24.263
They'll all be up front.

33:24.306 --> 33:26.047
Thank you so much, Bella,
for all of this.Mm-hmm.

33:26.091 --> 33:27.396
Your help has
been invaluable.

33:27.440 --> 33:29.050
Are you kidding?
I was hearing

33:29.094 --> 33:30.356
all these cool stories
from Tyler and Maya,

33:30.399 --> 33:31.705
and I just couldn't wait

33:31.748 --> 33:33.359
to get in
on the Greylock action.

33:33.402 --> 33:35.535
Yeah, seeing behind the curtain
didn't turn you off the process?

33:35.578 --> 33:37.015
No, it turned me on.

33:37.058 --> 33:40.105
Sorry, sorry, I didn't mean
"turned on" like turned on.

33:40.148 --> 33:42.368
I just meant that, um,
all this hard work

33:42.411 --> 33:43.891
has made me want
to help out even more.

33:43.934 --> 33:45.284
Well, that's really good,
'cause there's a lot to do.

33:45.327 --> 33:46.328
I'm gonna need you.

33:46.372 --> 33:47.590
Thank you, Bella.Mm-hmm.

33:49.984 --> 33:51.507
Hi.Hey.

33:51.551 --> 33:54.423
I'm really sorry
about all this, AJ.

33:54.467 --> 33:56.382
I want to help you
with your dad,

33:56.425 --> 33:59.341
but Greylock is bigger
than any one person.

33:59.385 --> 34:01.387
I had... I had to do
what I felt was right

34:01.430 --> 34:02.866
for the whole town.

34:02.910 --> 34:05.391
You had a vote and you used it,
Sarah, just like me.

34:05.434 --> 34:06.957
I lost.

34:07.001 --> 34:09.569
Let's just hope
I can win the next one.

34:09.612 --> 34:11.614
Good luck.
Thanks.

34:14.313 --> 34:16.228
So, if you get flustered,
the trick is just

34:16.271 --> 34:18.099
look over the top
of everyone's head.

34:18.143 --> 34:20.145
Actually, you're supposed
to pick a random person

34:20.188 --> 34:22.669
from the audience and
look them dead in the eye.

34:23.713 --> 34:25.193
Ellen.Paul.

34:25.237 --> 34:27.848
You should pretend you're
Gayle from Almost, Maine.

34:27.891 --> 34:28.849
You were great
in that.

34:28.892 --> 34:30.285
She didn't even sing.

34:30.329 --> 34:32.331
She's not gonna
sing. Are you?

34:32.374 --> 34:33.984
What? No.
No, I'm not gonna sing.

34:34.028 --> 34:36.378
Of course I'm not gonna sing.
Stop it, both of you, please.

34:36.422 --> 34:37.249
Just trying to help.Trying to help.

34:37.292 --> 34:38.380
Yeah, but it's weird.

34:38.424 --> 34:39.468
You're acting parental.
Please stop.

34:41.731 --> 34:43.777
Honestly, I'd breeze through
the financial projections,

34:43.820 --> 34:45.822
just stick to the exciting
stuff: the school, the clinic.

34:48.738 --> 34:51.089
Don't worry, sis.
You're gonna be great.

34:51.132 --> 34:52.090
Thanks, Danny.

34:53.178 --> 34:55.615
Have you, um,
heard from Corinne?

34:55.658 --> 34:57.573
Uh, not since she went
into the deposition.

34:57.617 --> 34:59.271
[whispers]: I'm sure
it's going fine.

34:59.314 --> 35:00.533
Yeah, I hope so.

35:00.576 --> 35:02.448
Anything can happen
in these cases.Well,

35:02.491 --> 35:04.014
hopefully not if you have
the right lawyer.

35:04.058 --> 35:05.712
You were really good
to help her with that.

35:05.755 --> 35:08.193
It's the least I could do after
screwing up her life so badly.

35:08.236 --> 35:09.368
I just know I'll sleep better

35:09.411 --> 35:10.717
once I know
she's out of this mess.

35:10.760 --> 35:11.805
Yeah, won't we all.

35:13.589 --> 35:16.201
Adam? Adam, stop.

35:16.244 --> 35:18.507
Adam! Are you kidding me?

35:18.551 --> 35:20.727
[car alarm chirps]What the hell was that?

35:20.770 --> 35:22.598
That was a deposition,Corinne.

35:22.642 --> 35:25.079
Really? Because to me it felt
more like a firing squad.

35:25.123 --> 35:26.428
Adam, your lawyer was

35:26.472 --> 35:28.474
way out of line.My lawyer was
doing her job.

35:28.517 --> 35:29.823
You yelling at
her like that

35:29.866 --> 35:31.651
in front of everyone is
what was out of line.

35:31.694 --> 35:33.740
No, she tried to make me look
like a criminal. Adam,

35:33.783 --> 35:36.917
what was that absurd list
of-of fake "incidents"?

35:36.960 --> 35:38.571
The whole town
saw you threaten Liz Fernsby

35:38.614 --> 35:39.615
at the debate
two months ago.

35:39.659 --> 35:40.573
Nothing fake about that.

35:40.616 --> 35:42.227
I was never gonna do anything...

35:42.270 --> 35:44.359
And you did have an affair,
right? Danny Cooper?

35:44.403 --> 35:45.882
Night of the blizzard?

35:45.926 --> 35:47.406
Or are we all just
imagining that one, too?

35:47.449 --> 35:49.495
That has nothing to do
with my abilities as a mother.

35:49.538 --> 35:51.584
You're impulsive
and you're combative,

35:51.627 --> 35:54.021
and I don't want you
around my son any longer.

35:54.064 --> 35:56.284
Adam! I am his mother.

35:56.328 --> 35:58.591
He belongs in Greylock
with me, and you know it.

35:58.634 --> 36:01.420
Greylock is practically
a third-world nation.

36:01.463 --> 36:03.335
Nobody belongs there.

36:03.378 --> 36:04.597
Power goes out.

36:04.640 --> 36:06.076
The borders get closed.

36:06.120 --> 36:07.774
The economy's unstable.
There's no disaster relief.

36:07.817 --> 36:09.428
And oh, yeah,
by the way,

36:09.471 --> 36:11.430
the whole place is being ruled
by a self-centered

36:11.473 --> 36:14.911
punk-rock wannabe
who-who deports teenagers.

36:14.955 --> 36:16.696
Raising a child
there is negligent,

36:16.739 --> 36:17.958
plain and simple.

36:18.001 --> 36:19.612
And if you can't see that,
I can.

36:19.655 --> 36:21.614
[sighs] I won't be
subjecting Josh to that

36:21.657 --> 36:22.919
any longer.Adam, come on.

36:22.963 --> 36:24.530
Adam, please, I'm sorry.

36:24.573 --> 36:26.836
[engine starts]Adam, I'm so sorry.
Can we just talk?

36:26.880 --> 36:28.490
You know this is
crazy. Just...

36:28.534 --> 36:29.926
Adam!

36:36.106 --> 36:39.066
[applause]

36:39.109 --> 36:41.068
Hi.

36:41.111 --> 36:42.548
I'm Sarah Cooper.

36:42.591 --> 36:46.160
And today I'm gonna show you
Greylock's future,

36:46.204 --> 36:49.859
a future that didn't exist
until we came together

36:49.903 --> 36:52.297
to fight for the community
that we love.

36:52.340 --> 36:55.822
And now that community is
the world's newest country.

36:55.865 --> 37:00.000
A place for compassion,
innovation

37:00.043 --> 37:04.091
and progress to call home.

37:04.134 --> 37:07.747
This future was dreamt
in our minds.

37:07.790 --> 37:10.053
It was built by our hands.

37:10.097 --> 37:11.838
It belongs to all of us.

37:11.881 --> 37:15.972
So as we celebrate
Greylock taking its first step

37:16.016 --> 37:18.279
onto the world stage today,

37:18.323 --> 37:21.021
let's remember
to never stop dreaming,

37:21.064 --> 37:23.676
never stop building,

37:23.719 --> 37:25.678
and, most importantly,

37:25.721 --> 37:29.290
never stop fighting
for the community that we love.

37:29.334 --> 37:31.336
[applause]

37:33.338 --> 37:34.904
[quietly]:
Ah.

37:40.954 --> 37:44.262
[takes deep breath]

37:46.742 --> 37:49.310
CORINNE [crying]:
Sarah? Sarah?

37:53.358 --> 37:55.882
Whoa, whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa.
What happened?Sarah, Sarah, Sarah...

37:55.925 --> 37:58.058
I'm gonna lose Josh.
I'm gonna lose...

37:58.101 --> 38:01.714
I'm gonna lose my son.
[sobbing]
Okay.

38:01.757 --> 38:03.106
What do I do?
What do I do?

38:03.150 --> 38:05.065
Come here, come here,
come here, come here.

38:06.458 --> 38:09.156
[gasping breaths]Hey, hey,
hey, hey, hey,

38:09.199 --> 38:11.071
slow down, slow down--
tell me what happened.

38:11.114 --> 38:12.986
Okay, um...

38:13.029 --> 38:15.118
this morning w-was a disaster.

38:15.162 --> 38:17.164
I had a complete meltdown

38:17.207 --> 38:18.948
in front of
everyone, and...

38:18.992 --> 38:20.907
Adam's lawyer tore me apart,

38:20.950 --> 38:25.172
and they all think
I'm an awful... mother.

38:26.782 --> 38:28.393
Am I an awful mother?

38:28.436 --> 38:29.394
No, no.

38:29.437 --> 38:30.351
I'm an awful mother.

38:30.395 --> 38:32.005
[sobbing]

38:35.051 --> 38:37.097
I can't lose Josh.

38:37.140 --> 38:38.838
I can't lose him, Sarah.

38:38.881 --> 38:40.753
I can't.
He's my whole world.

38:40.796 --> 38:42.929
Adam's gonna take him. He's
gonna take him away from me.

38:42.972 --> 38:44.278
He's gonna take him.

38:44.322 --> 38:47.107
I can't lose him...

38:47.150 --> 38:49.065
[Corinne continues sobbing]

38:49.109 --> 38:51.198
[sniffles]
Corinne.

38:51.241 --> 38:53.113
â™ª

38:53.156 --> 38:56.421
Adam isn't Josh's father.

38:56.464 --> 38:59.946
Danny is. Danny is
Josh's biological father.

38:59.989 --> 39:01.991
That's not funny.It's not a joke.

39:05.168 --> 39:08.302
I lied to you about the results
of the DNA test.

39:08.346 --> 39:10.391
You wanted it
to be Adam.

39:10.435 --> 39:12.219
You said that you needed it
to be Adam, because...

39:12.262 --> 39:13.960
because if it
was Danny,

39:14.003 --> 39:15.483
your whole world
would be upended.

39:15.527 --> 39:16.702
So I told you
what you wanted to hear.

39:16.745 --> 39:19.400
I told you that it was Adam.

39:19.444 --> 39:22.925
But-but the truth
is that it is Danny.

39:22.969 --> 39:24.884
It is Danny.

39:25.928 --> 39:27.321
I'm telling you now
because...

39:27.365 --> 39:29.410
Danny being Josh's biological
father gives him rights

39:29.454 --> 39:30.542
in a custody hearing.

39:30.585 --> 39:32.108
He can help you keep Josh
in Greylock.

39:33.806 --> 39:36.461
Oh, my God, you're serious.

39:36.504 --> 39:38.637
How could...

39:38.680 --> 39:41.074
how could you lie
about something like that?

39:41.117 --> 39:42.771
I...To lie about this...

39:42.815 --> 39:44.643
I was try...
I was trying to help.No.

39:44.686 --> 39:46.122
Oh, oh, my God.

39:46.166 --> 39:49.822
I thought it was gonna help.
I'm so sorry.No. No.

39:49.865 --> 39:51.084
[crying in distance]

39:51.127 --> 39:54.653
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.

39:54.696 --> 39:59.005
â™ª Her name was Joy...

39:59.048 --> 40:01.442
Corrine?

40:01.486 --> 40:04.053
â™ª Joy

40:04.097 --> 40:06.926
â™ª Her name was Joy...

40:06.969 --> 40:09.015
Corrine? Corrine, Corrine, stop.

40:09.058 --> 40:11.626
Please. Please stop. Corrine?

40:11.670 --> 40:12.975
[running steps]

40:13.019 --> 40:14.977
Sarah, there you are.

40:15.021 --> 40:16.849
Oh, my God, there you are.

40:16.892 --> 40:18.807
Thank God. Thank God
I found you.

40:18.851 --> 40:21.462
The sound guy disappeared, so we
didn't know how to cut the feed.

40:21.506 --> 40:23.769
Wait, what are
you talking about?

40:23.812 --> 40:24.944
Wait, was that thing on

40:24.987 --> 40:26.424
this whole time?

40:28.904 --> 40:31.429
â™ª We dissolve...

40:31.472 --> 40:33.518
So the whole town
just heard that I...

40:33.561 --> 40:35.084
Everyone just...?

40:36.912 --> 40:38.914
â™ª We dissolve...

40:38.958 --> 40:41.134
Oh, my God.

40:42.614 --> 40:47.706
â™ª Before we fold

40:47.749 --> 40:50.491
â™ª I'm too old

40:50.535 --> 40:52.754
â™ª To remember

40:52.798 --> 40:56.889
â™ª Where I'm from

40:56.932 --> 41:01.067
â™ª We dissolve

41:01.110 --> 41:03.939
â™ª Before we fold.
