WEBVTT

00:03.295 --> 00:05.378
- Someone's been in my room.
- You need to tell security.

00:05.380 --> 00:06.608
What on earth
were you doing in there?

00:06.632 --> 00:08.276
Just these little things that she does.

00:08.300 --> 00:09.836
How much d'you love me, Rose?

00:09.885 --> 00:11.592
- Did you get her?
- Nailed her.

00:11.637 --> 00:14.596
I've lost my engagement ring.
I think Rose took it.

00:14.640 --> 00:16.242
Are you sure you don't want
any more wine, Leah?

00:16.265 --> 00:17.347
Give me that!

00:17.392 --> 00:19.884
There! She set me up Adam! She's clever!

00:19.937 --> 00:23.601
You're projecting all your anxiety
and stress onto this ridiculous argument.

00:23.649 --> 00:25.606
How's Aunty Pam?

00:25.734 --> 00:27.521
You're a spiteful little girl, aren't you?

00:27.569 --> 00:29.606
Oh where's that photo gone?

00:29.655 --> 00:31.772
Bloody thing fell off the wall
and the frame broke.

00:31.823 --> 00:34.065
Thank you. For this evening. It was fun.

00:34.743 --> 00:38.908
If a person that you love
keeps telling you that you're paranoid...

00:39.373 --> 00:41.410
at what point do you start to believe them?

00:41.458 --> 00:45.418
You are still not convinced
that we got the right one.

00:45.837 --> 00:46.837
Are you?

00:48.000 --> 00:54.074

01:00.018 --> 01:01.018
Leah?

01:03.230 --> 01:04.581
Leah!

01:04.605 --> 01:06.689
I said are we ready to start?

01:08.610 --> 01:10.067
Leah, are you OK?

01:11.196 --> 01:12.196
Leah?

01:14.700 --> 01:15.861
Leah!

01:16.660 --> 01:18.196
Are we ready to start?

01:18.954 --> 01:20.411
Absolutely.

01:23.542 --> 01:26.626
So you all have, erm...

01:26.670 --> 01:29.208
a copy of the essay in question.

01:37.556 --> 01:41.015
Actually, I've erm...
I've just received some...

01:41.059 --> 01:43.392
personal news. Sorry.

01:43.437 --> 01:46.350
Are you OK?
- Is there anything we can do to help?

01:51.695 --> 01:55.735
Leah, we won't get another opportunity
to reconvene before the end of term.

01:55.782 --> 01:57.865
This happens now,
or it doesn't happen at all.

02:02.289 --> 02:03.575
Sorry.

02:21.016 --> 02:23.349
Come on...

02:30.025 --> 02:32.267
OK up. Up.

02:33.487 --> 02:34.944
Not that far! Down!

02:35.489 --> 02:38.357
Down! Down, down...
Are you trying to annoy me?

03:07.938 --> 03:10.351
Hello love.
We're not expecting you, were we?

03:10.399 --> 03:12.641
Mum wanted me to get some ice for the party.

03:13.527 --> 03:14.734
Oh, OK.

03:15.237 --> 03:16.944
You alright?
- Yeah!

03:17.030 --> 03:20.319
Yeah. Gonna put this in the freezer.

03:32.754 --> 03:34.711
Hello, Francis.

03:34.840 --> 03:37.173
Yeah, fine. I'm fine.

03:40.679 --> 03:42.011
Ah!

03:42.431 --> 03:45.799
Ah, that's fantastic news, thank you.

03:46.935 --> 03:50.599
Yeah. Yes, of course,
I'll be sure to let everyone know.

03:50.814 --> 03:53.101
Ah. Alright, speak soon.

03:53.400 --> 03:54.400
Bye.

04:08.165 --> 04:11.124
There you go, sweetheart.
- You have it, Mum. I'm not feeling great.

04:12.878 --> 04:15.336
Your dad and I are disgusted
with what he's done.

04:16.339 --> 04:17.539
D'you want me to speak to him?

04:17.923 --> 04:19.005
No!

04:19.968 --> 04:21.175
No, we're fine.

04:22.512 --> 04:27.507
Yeah, hello, it's me again.
Will you please just answer your phone?

04:27.809 --> 04:29.766
Also, I've erm...

04:30.061 --> 04:34.601
Well I've kind of got some good news, so...

04:34.775 --> 04:36.687
I've just been at your office, where are you?

04:40.572 --> 04:41.688
Hi Adam.
- Ah!

04:41.740 --> 04:42.901
Have you seen Leah?

04:42.949 --> 04:47.159
Erm, no, you wouldn't happen
to know where she is...

04:47.871 --> 04:49.703
Nice shorts.

04:51.249 --> 04:52.956
Thank you! Yes, erm...

04:53.835 --> 04:57.829
I took great care to
pair these with this faded...

04:58.381 --> 05:02.967
possibly lasagne stained t-shirt, so I'm glad
you're around to appreciate the erm...

05:03.011 --> 05:06.254
Ensemble?
- The ensemble. Yes, exactly. Thank you.

05:06.890 --> 05:08.597
I'm sorry about last night.

05:10.352 --> 05:12.184
Oh. No don't. I mean...

05:12.229 --> 05:14.186
We were drunk.
- We were drunk, exactly.

05:15.482 --> 05:17.895
So d'you mind deleting the, erm...

05:19.694 --> 05:21.526
Oh, of course! I've already done it.

05:21.988 --> 05:22.988
Oh...

05:25.408 --> 05:28.025
I... I mean I will, I promise.

05:28.078 --> 05:32.163
And... and do delete mine. Please.

05:33.542 --> 05:35.499
Is Leah alright, by the way?

05:35.836 --> 05:38.294
Well, she's not answering her phone.

05:39.297 --> 05:42.415
How did the review go this morning?
- Well that's why I'm asking.

05:42.467 --> 05:44.754
It was just about to start,
and she got up and left.

05:45.011 --> 05:46.092
What do you mean?

05:46.137 --> 05:49.596
She looked a bit upset
and then she kinda rushed off.

05:50.392 --> 05:52.384
So the review didn't happen at all?

05:54.604 --> 05:55.604
Hm.

06:06.491 --> 06:08.232
How much lime do you want in this, Mum?

06:08.285 --> 06:11.244
Oh God! I'll do that.
Go and have a lie down. Go on.

06:11.955 --> 06:14.368
You took your time?
- Yeah well, the little shop

06:14.416 --> 06:16.499
was out of that sherry that Kay likes.

06:16.543 --> 06:19.502
Had to go to bloody Sainsbury's.
Complete nightmare.

06:20.213 --> 06:22.671
Been thinking Leah,
maybe you should take the week off.

06:23.008 --> 06:25.421
Give old what's-her-name a wide berth.

06:25.760 --> 06:28.197
I've got my appraisal tomorrow.
That wouldn't look good, would it?

06:28.221 --> 06:31.965
I know,
but she seems like a nasty piece of work.

06:32.017 --> 06:33.804
Maybe you should just take it easy?

06:33.852 --> 06:36.469
I can handle her, OK?
- Not from where I'm standing you can't.

06:39.316 --> 06:41.478
Thanks Dad.
- Leah I...

06:44.237 --> 06:46.445
I just can't stand to see her like this.

07:13.099 --> 07:14.806
Angela, is Leah here?

07:14.851 --> 07:16.058
Leah?

07:18.480 --> 07:19.937
Leah, love?

07:21.024 --> 07:23.141
I think she asleep.
She wasn't feeling too well.

07:23.193 --> 07:24.775
You've got a bloody nerve.

07:24.986 --> 07:27.524
What?
- No, love. It's not on.

07:27.572 --> 07:29.342
Yeah, I know that,
but it's between the two of them.

07:29.366 --> 07:31.552
Look at him.
He doesn't even know, it's pathetic.

07:31.576 --> 07:33.408
We know what you've been doing.
- Darling.

07:33.453 --> 07:36.662
Sending filthy texts to that young girl.
It's disgusting.

07:36.706 --> 07:37.787
Leah!
- Hey!

07:37.832 --> 07:39.824
- Just leave it.
- It makes me sick.

07:51.596 --> 07:52.596
Hey.

08:01.564 --> 08:04.523
Do you wanna talk about this now? Or...

08:05.777 --> 08:08.440
It's up to you, Adam. I really don't mind.

08:09.239 --> 08:10.446
OK.

08:16.496 --> 08:18.488
I, erm...

08:20.542 --> 08:22.659
I just want you to know...

08:34.054 --> 08:35.054
You're...

08:37.851 --> 08:39.342
You're pregnant?

08:40.227 --> 08:41.308
Yeah...

08:48.319 --> 08:49.400
Yeah.

09:09.507 --> 09:10.918
Excuse me.

09:11.384 --> 09:15.173
Hello...
Yes, erm... I'm here to visit a student.

09:15.180 --> 09:17.012
- My daughter.
- Name, sir?

09:17.057 --> 09:20.095
Rose Vaughan.
- And does she know that you're coming, sir?

09:20.310 --> 09:23.053
Not exactly.
It's kind of urgent, can I just...?

09:23.104 --> 09:26.222
Yeah, you just wait here a minute,
I'll... I'll see what I can do.

09:55.595 --> 09:57.882
What do you want?
- Don't give me that Rose.

09:57.931 --> 09:59.138
We need to talk.

09:59.516 --> 10:01.382
You think I don't know what you're doing?

10:06.731 --> 10:09.599
What, did I say you could come in?
- Look, please, may I come in

10:09.651 --> 10:10.767
so we can talk?

10:13.404 --> 10:16.363
You need to stay away from Leah.
She's got nothing to do with any of it...

10:16.407 --> 10:17.943
She involved herself. Not me.

10:19.661 --> 10:21.072
You've made your point.

10:21.538 --> 10:24.155
But now, please.

10:24.749 --> 10:28.083
Can we just for everyone's sake...
- What, you mean for your sake?

10:28.837 --> 10:30.749
You promised me
that you'd tell them, Michael.

10:30.797 --> 10:35.292
I know, but it's our anniversary
tomorrow for God's sake.

10:35.969 --> 10:37.210
Have a heart.

10:38.054 --> 10:39.886
Please don't tell them, Rose.

10:40.598 --> 10:43.557
I just need a little more time.
- They deserve to know.

10:45.019 --> 10:47.511
I don't know how many times
I can say I'm sorry.

10:48.106 --> 10:49.642
I am going to tell them...

10:50.358 --> 10:51.358
soon.

10:51.901 --> 10:55.941
But please, don't punish Leah for my mistake.

10:56.072 --> 10:57.313
Please.

11:04.956 --> 11:06.413
Thanks for this.

11:09.419 --> 11:11.411
It's not exactly like I had a choice is it?

11:15.592 --> 11:17.049
Well, thanks anyway.

11:17.886 --> 11:19.502
It'll mean a lot to Pamela.

11:23.349 --> 11:25.591
I don't know why we have to go
and hold her hand.

11:33.234 --> 11:34.645
It's pathetic, Adam.

11:36.321 --> 11:38.233
You know I never would've...

11:38.573 --> 11:41.156
I... I would never actually...

11:42.035 --> 11:43.526
Actually what?

11:46.331 --> 11:48.038
She's such a stupid girl...

11:48.082 --> 11:49.789
Oh, don't blame her for this.

11:49.834 --> 11:52.042
I... I saw her this morning.
She lied through her teeth!

11:52.086 --> 11:55.124
Don't insult my intelligence Adam,
I know exactly how it all played out.

11:55.298 --> 11:57.756
You sent that text
because she flattered you, didn't she?

11:57.842 --> 12:00.946
She looked up to you, she made it really easy
for you to feel good about yourself.

12:00.970 --> 12:02.131
And I don't do that.

12:02.388 --> 12:04.175
It was a drunken moment of weakness.

12:04.224 --> 12:07.513
And I...
I'm not playing it down I am so sorry

12:08.478 --> 12:12.472
but it doesn't have to mean
anything more than that.

12:12.523 --> 12:14.355
I'm drawing a line under this now. It...

12:14.776 --> 12:17.769
It's not about that text Adam.
This is about us.

12:19.697 --> 12:20.733
Alright.

12:20.865 --> 12:23.198
I know I've been an idiot,
and not just about this.

12:23.243 --> 12:24.575
About a lot of things

12:24.911 --> 12:29.656
but this changes everything.

12:32.210 --> 12:34.202
No, it doesn't change anything.

12:34.545 --> 12:35.706
Does it?

12:39.467 --> 12:41.254
This isn't gonna work.

12:42.303 --> 12:43.919
No, sorry, Adam.

12:46.057 --> 12:48.344
Hang, hang on. Wait.
What are you saying?

12:48.393 --> 12:50.225
No. Don't follow me Adam, please.

13:12.584 --> 13:14.996
Lisa and Edward are coming
this afternoon...

13:15.795 --> 13:16.876
and erm...

13:18.006 --> 13:19.006
Diane...

13:19.757 --> 13:21.248
and the children.

13:22.427 --> 13:24.510
They're very much
looking forward to seeing you.

13:28.725 --> 13:29.806
Rose!

13:32.145 --> 13:33.431
Rose!

13:34.480 --> 13:35.721
Rose!

13:39.610 --> 13:41.897
Would you care to join in the conversation?

13:47.952 --> 13:49.659
I'll just wait outside.

13:50.246 --> 13:53.159
Don't you dare walk away.
Don't you dare!

13:54.542 --> 13:57.000
She is dying in there, don't you care at all?

13:57.045 --> 13:59.253
I mean, what is wrong with you?

13:59.297 --> 14:02.586
Well, what d'you thinks wrong with me?
- You cannot hold that against us forever.

14:02.633 --> 14:05.717
She... she was as devastated
by your mother's death as you were.

14:05.762 --> 14:08.800
They were sisters, for God sakes.
- I'll meet you by the car.

14:09.640 --> 14:10.676
I'm done with this.

14:10.975 --> 14:12.841
Your mother was the coward!

14:13.770 --> 14:18.185
And it's not Pam's fault your mother didn't
love you enough to stick around!

14:30.203 --> 14:33.662
Kettle's broken, so you've gotta
sort of heat the water up on the hob

14:33.706 --> 14:35.413
like a flipping caveman.

14:35.625 --> 14:40.120
Erm, you sure you're alright?
I can... I can stay in tonight if you like?

14:40.171 --> 14:42.163
No, I'm fine, go! Go, go.

14:42.340 --> 14:43.547
OK.

14:45.093 --> 14:49.053
Er... if you wanna watch tele,
I'd start looking for the remote now

14:49.097 --> 14:50.866
cos that little fucker
could be literally anywhere.

14:52.308 --> 14:53.308
Bye.

15:44.193 --> 15:45.400
Is everything OK?

15:46.320 --> 15:48.983
Yesterday, you just walked out.

15:49.115 --> 15:51.949
I know, I'm so sorry I... It's just...

15:54.579 --> 15:57.117
You and Charlotte,
you've been married, what...

15:57.748 --> 15:58.748
ten years?

16:00.460 --> 16:01.541
Eleven.

16:05.006 --> 16:07.794
Do you ever feel so unsupported
that you think the person

16:07.842 --> 16:10.710
that you're married to
might actually hate you, a little bit?

16:13.639 --> 16:15.005
No. I don't.

16:16.809 --> 16:17.845
No...

16:18.686 --> 16:20.393
The perfect marriage.

16:24.192 --> 16:25.192
No.

16:33.409 --> 16:35.401
So... what happens now?

16:35.453 --> 16:37.820
When will I hear
about the permanent position?

16:38.581 --> 16:42.074
We're going to have to delay
talks about your position here.

16:42.919 --> 16:45.627
In light of recent events
surrounding Rose Vaughan.

16:48.049 --> 16:49.210
I'm sorry, Leah.

16:50.426 --> 16:52.793
Ah, ah! No!

16:55.932 --> 16:58.345
Hugh, yes... yes.

16:59.268 --> 17:01.681
That's right. Number 48.

17:02.313 --> 17:03.599
Seven o'clock.

17:05.691 --> 17:07.353
I told you not to call me.

17:09.028 --> 17:10.609
You've not told them, have you?

17:11.989 --> 17:13.400
<i>You 're a co ward, Michael.</i>

17:13.491 --> 17:14.698
Rose, please.

17:14.700 --> 17:16.656
You could have stopped this, you know?

17:27.713 --> 17:28.954
Everything alright?

17:29.131 --> 17:31.589
Yes. Drives me up the wall, that one.

17:31.717 --> 17:33.253
Right, where are those glasses?

17:42.687 --> 17:43.687
Leah.

17:44.313 --> 17:46.771
- I've been looking everywhere for you.
- Not now.

17:46.816 --> 17:50.150
Well. What, can we talk
tonight then at the party, or...?

17:50.194 --> 17:52.464
- I think it's better if you don't come.
- Well, when then?

17:52.488 --> 17:53.569
I don't know.

17:54.574 --> 17:57.282
Oh God, you haven't... I mean you are still?

17:58.244 --> 18:00.452
Adam, I haven't even had time to think yet.

18:02.290 --> 18:04.210
Look I haven't had a chance to tell you
but um...

18:05.209 --> 18:06.209
We got the grant.

18:06.252 --> 18:07.538
The Hurst Foundation.

18:08.421 --> 18:10.333
But I want you to know that I turned it down.

18:11.757 --> 18:12.998
You shouldn't have done that.

18:13.050 --> 18:14.916
Well, I wanna be there for you and the baby.

18:15.303 --> 18:17.966
And I... I got you a present.

18:18.848 --> 18:21.591
It's my favourite book when I was a child.

18:22.977 --> 18:26.311
You don't have to keep it or anything,
I just thought you might like to...

18:27.481 --> 18:28.847
My God.

18:38.075 --> 18:39.941
Be careful on that thing...

18:46.542 --> 18:49.285
How did you know, Mum,
that Dad was the one?

18:50.379 --> 18:53.918
Seriously though.
How can you be so sure of how you feel?

18:56.886 --> 18:58.969
I think it's because for me, it's...

18:59.430 --> 19:02.173
it's not a feeling, it's a decision.

19:02.892 --> 19:07.136
I wake up every morning
and decide to love that father of yours

19:07.647 --> 19:09.730
and I commit
to that decision every single day.

19:09.940 --> 19:13.229
And you know, it takes a lot of work.

19:13.819 --> 19:15.685
And forgiveness is a part of it.

19:16.697 --> 19:18.484
You think I should forgive him then?

19:19.158 --> 19:21.219
Happy people don't send
photographs of their genitals

19:21.243 --> 19:22.905
to twenty-one-year-olds, do they?

19:23.621 --> 19:25.078
What do you want to say to me, Mum?

19:25.956 --> 19:27.788
I suppose what I'm saying is, it's...

19:28.417 --> 19:30.604
you know, it's not a question
of whether or not to forgive him

19:30.628 --> 19:31.869
for this particular incident.

19:31.921 --> 19:34.629
It's... whether you've got
the energy to work together

19:34.674 --> 19:38.167
on the fundamental flaws
that are clearly there.

20:44.118 --> 20:45.700
Hello, Rose.

20:48.748 --> 20:49.909
Where are you?

20:50.124 --> 20:51.456
You came.

20:56.338 --> 20:58.500
Rose, where are you?

21:46.388 --> 21:47.845
How the hell d'you get up here?

21:48.432 --> 21:50.924
Can't we, can't we talk inside?

21:50.976 --> 21:52.512
No! Come on, sit next to me.

21:52.561 --> 21:53.972
Rose.
- Come on.

21:55.648 --> 21:57.459
I'm not getting up there.
- Oh, go on, I'll hold your hand.

21:57.483 --> 21:58.769
Nope.
- Go on!

21:59.401 --> 22:01.768
Adam, don't be a dick. Just sit next to me.

22:03.948 --> 22:05.905
Adam, come on.

22:08.869 --> 22:11.361
Argh, fuck sake.

22:16.961 --> 22:18.497
Argh!

22:21.090 --> 22:22.456
It's beautiful, isn't it?

22:24.677 --> 22:26.168
Did you have to send it to her?

22:27.137 --> 22:29.504
What was I supposed to do?
She backed me into a corner.

22:30.766 --> 22:32.132
Why, is it bad?

22:33.185 --> 22:35.518
Well she's finished with me,
if that's what you mean.

22:35.563 --> 22:38.601
Don't worry, she'll come to her senses.

22:38.649 --> 22:41.312
It's not... it's not funny.
- It is a bit funny.

22:41.402 --> 22:43.940
You used me to get out of some stupid review.

22:43.988 --> 22:46.731
Do you understand
why I might be just a little bit angry?

22:46.740 --> 22:48.697
Hey.
- Just lighten up, yeah?

22:50.536 --> 22:52.152
Argh!

22:54.540 --> 22:57.499
What, what are you doing?
- Do you remember them trust games at school?

22:57.543 --> 23:00.188
Rose! Stop it come on lets...
- Don't you feel close to me right now?

23:00.212 --> 23:02.329
Look...

23:02.381 --> 23:03.462
Go on ask me something.

23:03.507 --> 23:06.250
Go on ask me anything,
then I'll come back in, I promise.

23:09.179 --> 23:11.091
Why'd you ask me up here tonight?

23:11.265 --> 23:13.473
I mean, you've won. It's all over.

23:14.560 --> 23:15.971
What am I doing here?

23:17.313 --> 23:18.929
I like the way you make me feel.

23:19.565 --> 23:20.565
Don't you?

23:21.525 --> 23:23.187
Not right now, no.

23:23.235 --> 23:25.648
Why?

23:25.988 --> 23:27.479
Isn't it exciting?
- Argh!

23:27.531 --> 23:28.971
Come on don't you feel alive?
- Argh!

23:30.492 --> 23:31.528
Just think about it.

23:31.577 --> 23:34.177
If you pull really hard right now,
one of two things could happen.

23:34.622 --> 23:37.615
You could slip, one or both of us would fall.

23:39.460 --> 23:44.251
Or you could pull me in, we'll go back
to my room and we'll fuck till morning.

23:44.965 --> 23:46.547
That's exciting, isn't it?

24:05.903 --> 24:06.903
Hey...

24:49.697 --> 24:51.780
Shall I nip out and get us a bottle of wine?

24:53.117 --> 24:55.700
Ah... I'm not sure, maybe.

25:03.502 --> 25:05.414
...a top up. Thank you.

25:30.904 --> 25:32.145
Oh stop it.

25:47.546 --> 25:48.707
I'll be back soon.

26:19.870 --> 26:21.577
You fucking prick.

26:42.935 --> 26:44.016
Rose?

26:47.731 --> 26:48.972
Rose?

28:30.125 --> 28:31.125
Adam?

28:47.809 --> 28:49.766
I haven't got time for this, Adam.

30:21.195 --> 30:22.685
Why aren't you at the party?

30:23.363 --> 30:24.322
Is everything OK?

30:24.324 --> 30:25.675
Was that her with your phone?
- Is she here?

30:25.699 --> 30:26.699
No, I got...
- What do you mean?

30:26.701 --> 30:29.659
I got a text from your phone,
telling me to come here.

30:29.870 --> 30:31.577
What was she doing with your phone?

30:31.997 --> 30:33.738
Well have you seen her? Is she here?

30:33.790 --> 30:35.310
The door was locked Adam,
there's no one here.

30:35.334 --> 30:40.546
OK, you go to the party.
I'll stay here in case she comes back.

30:40.630 --> 30:41.916
Why did she have your phone?

30:42.549 --> 30:45.132
Just go to the party. I'll join you there.

30:45.177 --> 30:46.543
Just tell me the truth, Adam.

30:48.889 --> 30:50.551
Alright, so...

30:51.892 --> 30:54.134
I was in the pub all afternoon.

30:54.186 --> 30:56.269
I was feeling pretty...

30:58.440 --> 31:02.810
Anyway, I get a call from Rose
telling me to go straight over to her place.

31:02.861 --> 31:04.102
Why?
- Well I...

31:04.154 --> 31:06.692
I don't know and I say "no" straight away.

31:06.740 --> 31:11.531
Uh... and then she gets really angry,
starts screaming at me

31:11.578 --> 31:15.822
all this shit about how she's gonna
tell you that we slept together.

31:16.083 --> 31:17.415
Right.
- I know.

31:17.459 --> 31:20.497
So, I'd had enough by then,
obviously, so, err...

31:20.545 --> 31:23.709
I hang up and then, err...

31:24.007 --> 31:27.250
a few minutes later
I, err, go to the loo, come back...

31:27.928 --> 31:33.765
and well I... I didn't notice straight away
but my phone had gone.

31:34.643 --> 31:36.123
How did she know that you were there?

31:39.022 --> 31:41.014
So you just assumed that it was Rose?

31:41.566 --> 31:44.274
No. I didn't assume. I knew.

31:44.486 --> 31:46.773
How?
- Because I found this.

31:48.031 --> 31:49.522
Was in my jacket pocket.

31:54.746 --> 31:58.285
This... this is from my dad's study.
He told me it was getting re-framed.

31:58.333 --> 32:01.041
How... How did Rose come to have it?
- I don't... I don't know?

32:02.754 --> 32:06.964
OK, look, you go to the party.
Talk to your dad.

32:07.426 --> 32:08.587
I'll wait here.

32:20.480 --> 32:24.099
I do love you Leah, I know I've f...

32:25.193 --> 32:27.025
I'm an idiot. But I do love you.

32:27.362 --> 32:30.049
And I know we're not the perfect couple,
we're far from the romantic ideal

32:30.073 --> 32:33.692
but I'm OK with that because we just,
we have to be good enough.

32:35.162 --> 32:38.496
And I promise I, I'm gonna work
so much harder towards that and even

32:38.540 --> 32:41.749
and if everything does go tits up,
I know there's no other women in the world

32:41.793 --> 32:43.521
I would rather be mother
to my child than you

32:43.545 --> 32:45.002
and that has to mean something.

32:46.465 --> 32:48.001
It has to mean something.

32:50.343 --> 32:53.586
This... this might be our only chance.

33:18.413 --> 33:20.370
Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls.

33:20.874 --> 33:22.035
Come here, love.

33:22.751 --> 33:25.480
I hope you've had enough to drink
cos I'm about to get a bit sentimental.

33:25.504 --> 33:26.711
Oh, God.

33:26.755 --> 33:31.216
Forty-something years ago,
I walked into a little country pub

33:31.843 --> 33:34.756
and saw the most beautiful woman
I'd ever laid eyes on.

33:35.305 --> 33:36.967
Yeah. She was sat next to me!

33:38.892 --> 33:40.599
I went into that pub originally

33:40.685 --> 33:43.052
for directions,
and that's exactly what I got.

33:43.146 --> 33:47.140
Because when I came out,
several hours and pints later.

33:47.192 --> 33:49.900
I had a road map of the rest of my life

33:50.320 --> 33:54.234
with Angela laid out
before me as clear as day.

33:55.033 --> 33:56.069
Rose!

33:59.079 --> 34:00.365
Rose, where are you?

34:00.580 --> 34:03.869
Now we've often got lost
in the undergrowth

34:04.042 --> 34:07.001
or taken the path less well travelled

34:07.379 --> 34:11.123
but the thing is we've always done it
together and it's been a hell of a ride.

34:11.882 --> 34:16.217
So will you join me in raising
your glasses to my partner in crime

34:16.554 --> 34:19.263
my navigator and my compass.

34:19.975 --> 34:21.181
Angela.

34:21.601 --> 34:23.217
To Angela!

34:25.855 --> 34:26.891
Leah!

34:27.524 --> 34:31.359
Keep your glasses in the air, ladies and
gentlemen, for our brilliant daughter Leah.

34:31.402 --> 34:32.688
To Leah!

34:32.779 --> 34:34.735
- I need to talk to you, Dad.
- What?

34:34.781 --> 34:35.817
Now.

34:36.449 --> 34:37.781
Everything alright?

34:39.119 --> 34:41.953
Thank you. Cheers everybody. Cheers.

34:43.164 --> 34:44.496
Where the hell are you?

34:44.541 --> 34:45.782
You looking for me?

34:48.295 --> 34:50.206
Give me my fucking keys.

35:01.933 --> 35:04.373
What the hell are you doing here, Rose?
Tell me what you want.

35:16.281 --> 35:18.068
Why did Rose have this picture?

35:19.409 --> 35:20.445
I don't know.

35:22.621 --> 35:25.238
You told me it'd fallen down,
and it was being re-framed.

35:25.290 --> 35:26.290
I...

35:26.499 --> 35:28.832
Did you give it to Rose?

35:30.503 --> 35:33.041
Has... Has she been to this house?
- Of course not.

35:33.089 --> 35:34.330
What's going on?

35:34.549 --> 35:36.336
Why are you lying, Dad?
- Look...

35:37.260 --> 35:39.252
can we have this conversation tomorrow?

35:39.304 --> 35:41.671
Do you actually...
do you actually know this girl?

35:41.723 --> 35:45.216
No, well, yes,
she may have been in one of my classes

35:45.268 --> 35:47.134
but I don't know her, know her.

35:47.896 --> 35:49.888
You're a terrible liar Michael.

35:49.939 --> 35:51.931
You always have been.
- There's nothing Ange.

35:52.609 --> 35:54.692
I don't know how she got the photo.

35:54.736 --> 35:57.570
I just assumed
it'd fallen off the wall. I swear.

35:57.989 --> 36:00.732
Ange. I promise. I don't know how she got it.

36:02.619 --> 36:04.611
OK, fine.

36:05.121 --> 36:06.737
Well, let's just ask her.

36:07.707 --> 36:08.666
What?

36:08.668 --> 36:10.787
Yeah, you got her number, haven't you Leah?

36:11.211 --> 36:16.047
Erm... I haven't, but Adam has.
- Oh, come on now.

36:16.091 --> 36:17.798
Can't we just enjoy the party?

36:17.842 --> 36:18.842
I'll call him.

36:22.305 --> 36:23.796
You really want to do this now?

36:23.890 --> 36:25.802
Oh God. Just tell us.

36:28.937 --> 36:31.850
It was a stupid, stupid mistake,
long time ago.

36:32.107 --> 36:34.315
Oh God. Just tell us, Michael!

36:34.943 --> 36:36.184
Sarah.

36:36.444 --> 36:40.529
My research assistant, when we lived
in the old house. You remember her?

36:47.831 --> 36:50.323
How long was it going on?
- It wasn't "going on".

36:50.375 --> 36:51.375
It was...

36:52.043 --> 36:53.534
two or three times at the most.

36:53.586 --> 36:55.748
Well which was it?
Was it two or was it three?

36:55.797 --> 36:57.333
I can barely remember. Three.

36:58.299 --> 37:00.256
But what does that have to do with this?

37:01.428 --> 37:04.262
Rose isn't just your student, Leah.

37:07.058 --> 37:08.094
She's your sister.

37:09.352 --> 37:11.844
I just wanted Michael
to tell Leah the truth.

37:15.066 --> 37:17.023
For six years William thought
he was my father.

37:17.986 --> 37:19.818
Mum told him the night that she died.

37:20.822 --> 37:23.439
He didn't really like me after that.

37:23.908 --> 37:26.616
He tracked me down
one night. Drunk and angry.

37:26.911 --> 37:29.574
Gave me a black eye and a broken nose.

37:30.415 --> 37:31.906
You told me you'd been mugged.

37:32.375 --> 37:33.786
He wanted you to look after her?

37:34.002 --> 37:36.540
No. He never said that.

37:36.588 --> 37:41.549
He just disappeared into the night
and I thought that was the end of it.

37:42.260 --> 37:43.967
I didn't even know her name.

37:45.263 --> 37:46.470
So how did Rose find out?

37:47.599 --> 37:49.682
It was during an argument
that he told me the truth.

37:51.311 --> 37:54.072
That's why I tracked them down.
Signed up to all of Michael's classes.

37:54.647 --> 37:56.934
Just waited for the right time to tell him.

37:57.442 --> 38:00.981
She asked
for all these extra meetings, extra tuition.

38:01.321 --> 38:05.361
And I thought, she's just keen
but then she told me the truth.

38:05.658 --> 38:09.368
So what, you told her
you wanted nothing to do with her?

38:09.954 --> 38:11.786
It wasn't as clean cut as that.

38:11.831 --> 38:13.163
Yeah, but essentially...

38:14.751 --> 38:17.789
I was terrified of losing you.
Of losing you both.

38:18.797 --> 38:21.255
So you were angry at Michael

38:22.175 --> 38:25.009
and decided to take it out on Leah.
Is that it?

38:25.762 --> 38:27.594
I just wanted to be part of something.

38:28.515 --> 38:29.926
Something real.

38:29.974 --> 38:31.385
And you said "no".

38:32.018 --> 38:34.010
You could have said "yes",
but you said "no".

38:34.479 --> 38:36.721
She became angry, volatile.

38:37.065 --> 38:38.226
Making threats.

38:38.274 --> 38:39.835
She kept turning up
at the house and telling me

38:39.859 --> 38:43.352
things she was going to do
to me and do to herself.

38:43.780 --> 38:45.692
So that's when she took the photo?

38:46.157 --> 38:47.364
Must have been.

38:47.826 --> 38:49.818
It was awful. Awful.

38:50.328 --> 38:53.571
I threatened her with police intervention
and she seemed to calm down.

38:54.332 --> 38:55.868
Then you mentioned her name.

38:58.294 --> 39:00.957
I had no idea what she was capable of...

39:07.303 --> 39:08.919
And what's the plan now?

39:11.224 --> 39:12.760
Tell Angela? Break her heart?

39:14.477 --> 39:17.970
Tell Leah about you and me?
Break her heart? Is that it?

39:18.940 --> 39:21.432
I suppose there's room
for professional solidarity.

39:23.236 --> 39:25.979
What, from one cheat to another, right?

39:30.577 --> 39:35.538
I'm so sorry about Michael.

39:36.958 --> 39:38.790
But Leah didn't know about you.

39:38.835 --> 39:41.748
I promise you that.
She's done nothing wrong.

39:42.005 --> 39:44.088
Alright then.
I'm not gonna tell her a thing.

39:45.300 --> 39:46.461
Really?
- Sure.

39:48.052 --> 39:50.214
But if she asks me I'm not gonna lie.

39:51.180 --> 39:53.012
That's not a problem, is it?

39:57.770 --> 39:59.261
She's pregnant.

40:01.024 --> 40:02.515
Leah... Leah's pregnant.

40:13.202 --> 40:15.034
Congratulations.
- I'm begging you, Rose.

40:15.538 --> 40:17.530
Well, like I say.
It's only a problem if she asks me.

40:17.540 --> 40:19.122
But she's not going to, is she?

40:20.209 --> 40:21.541
Because she trusts you.

40:22.837 --> 40:24.078
Maybe she doesn't.

40:24.255 --> 40:27.043
I don't know. But I'm not gonna lie
to someone I care about.

40:27.091 --> 40:28.423
What do you mean care about!

40:30.136 --> 40:31.576
What the hell are you talking about!

40:32.847 --> 40:34.588
We're not friends!

40:34.807 --> 40:36.639
Leah doesn't give a shit about you.

40:36.976 --> 40:38.512
You think this changes anything?

40:38.645 --> 40:40.372
After what you've put Leah through?
You think we're

40:40.396 --> 40:42.388
just gonna open our arms and let you in?

40:43.232 --> 40:45.098
This makes things worse!

40:46.319 --> 40:48.589
You're less than what you were before.
Do you understand that?

40:48.613 --> 40:49.899
You're less than nothing.

40:49.948 --> 40:52.468
Yeah, but you can't just cheat, Adam,
and expect to get away with it.

40:52.492 --> 40:53.844
You can't...
- Oh shut up. Shut up!

40:53.868 --> 40:55.985
Should've just let you fall
off the fucking roof.

40:56.287 --> 40:58.449
I genuinely think the world
would be a better place.

40:58.498 --> 41:00.865
Yeah but you didn't, though, did you?
- You're just a leech.

41:01.626 --> 41:04.164
Sucking the life
out of everything and everyone.

41:04.212 --> 41:07.125
We were so happy until you came along.

41:09.801 --> 41:12.839
It's like you don't know her at all.
It's really quite amusing.

41:13.596 --> 41:14.712
Is it?

41:15.640 --> 41:19.054
Leah's so tired of you and you can't see it.

41:20.186 --> 41:22.519
And why wouldn't she be?
You're a coward and she's not.

41:22.563 --> 41:23.999
And you both know it.
- Alright that's enough.

41:24.023 --> 41:25.355
Don't touch me.
- Come on!

41:25.400 --> 41:26.877
Don't touch me!
- Come on, get out of here.

41:26.901 --> 41:29.421
You can say what you want to Leah,
she won't believe you anyway.

41:29.529 --> 41:31.191
Mmm, she will.
- No, she won't.

41:32.949 --> 41:35.407
I heard your little story out there.

41:36.160 --> 41:38.402
What you really think
she's gonna believe you and not me?

41:38.454 --> 41:39.454
Of course.

41:39.539 --> 41:41.952
What even
when I give her all the little details?

41:42.875 --> 41:45.868
Like the precise size and shape of it.

41:47.046 --> 41:50.335
How it fit just snug in my hand.
And how far it went down my throat.

41:53.302 --> 41:56.340
Oh, and how it took you
fifteen minutes to get hard.

41:56.973 --> 41:58.714
What was that little joke you made?

41:59.434 --> 42:03.144
"Good things come to those who wait".
What, d'you tell Leah that joke?

42:04.605 --> 42:05.812
Course, you do.

42:06.232 --> 42:08.064
Just a little joke to hide the shame.

42:08.109 --> 42:09.878
The fear that you can't even fuck
like you used to

42:09.902 --> 42:12.235
because when that's gone
there really will be nothing.

42:21.205 --> 42:23.663
Do you know how easy
it was for me to flatter you?

42:24.542 --> 42:26.283
What to get inside your head?

42:26.461 --> 42:27.918
It was just a joke.

42:28.379 --> 42:30.245
You should be ashamed of yourself.

42:34.886 --> 42:36.343
What's wrong with you?

42:37.972 --> 42:40.555
Alright then, actually I might tell Leah.

42:41.726 --> 42:44.309
I wonder if she'll keep that baby.
I know that I wouldn't.

42:57.450 --> 43:00.067
St Helen's College, Porter's Office.
How can I help?

43:05.541 --> 43:06.827
Hello?

43:07.126 --> 43:08.242
<i>Ben?</i>

43:09.212 --> 43:11.454
Something bad's happened
and I need your help.

43:13.591 --> 43:16.278
So you arrived back
at the house at around quarter past midnight

43:16.302 --> 43:17.302
is that correct?

43:18.137 --> 43:20.137
And that's where you spoke
to Adam about the photo?

43:24.602 --> 43:28.972
No. I spoke to Adam about the photo
the first time I went back.

43:29.023 --> 43:30.980
And that would have been about...

43:31.859 --> 43:32.859
ten.

43:34.529 --> 43:38.318
The second time
he was lying on the floor, dead.

43:40.159 --> 43:41.491
So, err...

43:43.579 --> 43:47.539
I checked to see if he was breathing
but there...

43:50.378 --> 43:54.167
I called the police
and I held him until they arrived.

43:55.800 --> 43:58.417
So you arrived
back at the party at ten forty...

43:58.469 --> 44:00.229
and then you left again forty minutes later.

44:00.555 --> 44:01.555
Why?

44:01.848 --> 44:06.013
Oh, I had an argument with my dad.

44:08.062 --> 44:12.056
Your car was last picked up
by CCTV on Lexington Street at 11:20

44:12.108 --> 44:14.816
but you say you didn't arrive home
until an hour later.

44:15.403 --> 44:18.083
It's only a ten-minute drive.
What were you doing for all that time?

44:18.114 --> 44:20.697
I needed to clear my head
after the argument with my dad.

44:20.700 --> 44:22.862
So I... I went for a drive.

44:22.910 --> 44:24.071
For an hour?
- I'm sorry

44:24.120 --> 44:26.612
why are we sat here doing nothing?
We know who did this.

44:26.706 --> 44:28.698
Have you found Rose?
Have you arrested her yet?
