00:08.258 --> 00:10.176
[narrator] Previously on Riverdale:

00:11.344 --> 00:12.220
[gunshot]

00:12.303 --> 00:14.931
[Pop] This man,
his goal was something else.

00:15.015 --> 00:17.934
It was like the angel of death
had come to Riverdale.

00:18.018 --> 00:19.144
[gasping]

00:19.227 --> 00:21.187
-Hello, Dilton.
-Somebody has to teach them

00:21.271 --> 00:22.397
to stand their ground.

00:22.480 --> 00:24.858
[woman]
Your father's facing serious jail time.

00:24.941 --> 00:27.777
[man] Serpents take care of their own.
We got your back.

00:27.861 --> 00:31.364
Smithers, would you describe my father
as a good man?

00:31.448 --> 00:33.658
-I'd rather not say, miss.
-I told your father

00:33.742 --> 00:35.952
you were conflicted about helping him.

00:36.036 --> 00:39.330
"If you do not testify, your mother
might be drawn into this mess."

00:39.414 --> 00:42.167
Whether Sheriff Keller
finds the person who did this or not,

00:42.250 --> 00:45.628
you don't have to worry.
I'm gonna protect you, I swear it.

00:46.713 --> 00:49.382
[Jughead] Behold, Pop's Chock'lit Shoppe.

00:49.466 --> 00:51.468
For decades, the heart of Riverdale.

00:54.763 --> 00:55.847
What the hell?

00:56.973 --> 01:01.478
[Jughead] Now the latest casualty in the
town's ongoing battle against darkness.

01:08.860 --> 01:10.070
-Pop?
-[Pop] Did you see?

01:11.154 --> 01:13.823
Did you see what they wrote
on my Chock'lit Shoppe?

01:18.119 --> 01:18.995
[Archie] No, no, no.

01:19.537 --> 01:23.458
-[Fred] Ahem. We need a fire extinguisher?
-What are you doing up?

01:23.541 --> 01:26.544
-I was gonna bring you breakfast.
-I appreciate it,

01:26.628 --> 01:29.172
but I gotta get to moving around sometime.

01:31.382 --> 01:34.594
-Little early for that, isn't it?
-No, I'm good.

01:34.677 --> 01:37.555
The only thing you need
to worry about is getting better.

01:37.639 --> 01:38.681
[phone ringing]

01:38.765 --> 01:41.351
Crap. I gotta take this. I gotta go. Bye.

01:44.354 --> 01:45.480
Hi, Sheriff Keller?

01:46.147 --> 01:49.567
No. No, deputy, I've been leaving messages
for the sheriff.

01:49.651 --> 01:52.362
I need him to call me back
about my dad's case.

01:54.656 --> 01:55.657
[sighs]

01:59.619 --> 02:02.080
-TTFN, Smithers.
-[Smithers] Wait, Miss Veronica.

02:02.163 --> 02:04.290
You might wanna take the side exit.

02:04.707 --> 02:05.583
Why?

02:05.667 --> 02:06.501
[door opens]

02:06.584 --> 02:08.753
Yeah, why, Smithers?
Because she might bump into me

02:08.837 --> 02:11.673
-coming in from an early run?
-[Veronica] Good morning, Father.

02:11.756 --> 02:14.092
Mija, you leave before breakfast,

02:14.175 --> 02:17.262
you come home after your mother and I
have had dinner.

02:17.345 --> 02:20.140
I can't remember the last time
we had a meal together.

02:20.223 --> 02:22.559
I can. It was at the Dakota.

02:22.642 --> 02:24.144
The day you got arrested.

02:25.228 --> 02:28.731
Well, perhaps we should talk
about that tonight, at dinner.

02:29.232 --> 02:32.110
-The three of us.
-Unfortunately, I have plans.

02:32.193 --> 02:34.404
To quote that New Yorker cartoon:

02:34.487 --> 02:36.322
"How about never, Dad?

02:36.406 --> 02:37.824
Is never good for you?"

02:39.367 --> 02:41.411
[Jughead]
It's another win for the bad guys.

02:41.494 --> 02:43.955
No one was there. His entire staff quit.

02:44.372 --> 02:47.125
He's not sure how long
he'll be able to keep the doors open.

02:47.208 --> 02:48.376
Maybe not even a week.

02:48.459 --> 02:51.462
It's because of what happened to my dad.
People are freaking out.

02:51.546 --> 02:54.257
I gotta be honest.
I don't see myself going back soon.

02:54.340 --> 02:55.383
Wait, I'm sorry.

02:55.925 --> 02:57.427
Am I hearing acceptance?

02:58.177 --> 03:03.016
I'm not letting one psychopath with a gun
dictate what happens to our place.

03:03.975 --> 03:07.061
Jug, you went crazy
trying to save the drive-in.

03:07.604 --> 03:11.065
I can't take on any more social issues
right now.

03:11.149 --> 03:12.191
My hands are full.

03:12.275 --> 03:15.820
With your dad, of course.
And he should be your priority.

03:17.947 --> 03:20.783
-I'll take point on helping Pop Tate.
-[Veronica] I'll help.

03:20.867 --> 03:23.453
Anything to get me away
from my parents, I'm in.

03:23.536 --> 03:25.788
Another B and V team-up?

03:25.872 --> 03:28.708
They should make a video game
about you guys. I gotta jet.

03:29.375 --> 03:34.714
I'm off to meet my dad's court-appointed
joke of a lawyer at the sheriff's station.

03:34.797 --> 03:37.634
Let me come. I gotta drop some flyers off
for Sheriff Keller.

03:37.717 --> 03:38.551
[Betty] Bye.

03:46.184 --> 03:47.018
[door opens]

03:49.020 --> 03:50.271
[Keller] Thanks.

03:51.439 --> 03:52.398
[Archie] Sheriff Keller.

03:53.399 --> 03:55.652
Archie, how's your dad holding up?

03:55.735 --> 03:58.446
He'd be better
if you caught the guy who shot him.

03:58.529 --> 04:01.074
-We're doing everything we can.
-Me, too.

04:01.157 --> 04:04.285
I'm out here handing out flyers,
talking to neighbors,

04:04.369 --> 04:07.121
tracking my dad's credit cards.
His wallet is still missing.

04:07.205 --> 04:09.999
Which means this guy
has all of our information,

04:10.083 --> 04:12.627
including where we live.
And we were witnesses.

04:13.253 --> 04:16.464
If your guys are out patrolling,
let me go with them.

04:16.547 --> 04:17.924
-I can help.
-Well--

04:18.007 --> 04:20.301
[woman over radio]
Code 2, incident 5106. RD-6 took it.

04:20.927 --> 04:23.721
In Greendale? All right, copy that.
Give me a sec.

04:24.764 --> 04:25.848
Let us do our job.

04:26.849 --> 04:27.767
You take care.

04:33.398 --> 04:35.233
Let's talk about the damn deal.

04:35.316 --> 04:38.027
[man] First, to review the charges
you're facing,

04:38.653 --> 04:42.115
arson, destruction of evidence,
making a false confession,

04:42.740 --> 04:43.950
obstructing justice,

04:44.033 --> 04:47.370
not to mention this whole nasty mess
of dumping a dead kid in the river.

04:47.453 --> 04:48.663
I know what I did.

04:50.123 --> 04:51.082
What's the deal?

04:52.250 --> 04:55.420
-What are they offering?
-You're gonna wanna take it.

04:56.879 --> 05:00.675
I've been doing this a long time.
It's a strong deal.

05:00.758 --> 05:04.762
How many... damn... years?

05:11.978 --> 05:13.021
[boards rattling]

05:24.615 --> 05:26.451
Whoa, whoa. Whoa.

05:27.035 --> 05:27.869
[Archie] Jughead.

05:29.037 --> 05:30.997
-Are you insane?
-You're the one that looks

05:31.080 --> 05:34.125
like a Dream Warrior
from Nightmare on Elm Street 3.

05:35.084 --> 05:36.502
What did the lawyer say?

05:39.088 --> 05:43.134
I've been walking around trying
to wrap my head around how bad it is.

05:44.469 --> 05:45.470
It's bad.

05:47.805 --> 05:49.807
My dad is facing 20 years, Archie.

05:52.351 --> 05:54.562
Crap, Jughead. I'm sorry. That sucks.

05:56.522 --> 05:59.233
The lawyer thinks he should take the deal.

05:59.317 --> 06:03.529
If he doesn't and the case goes to trial,
he could be facing 40 years.

06:07.909 --> 06:09.786
I'm just really, really scared.

06:12.997 --> 06:13.956
Yeah, me, too.

06:15.416 --> 06:16.334
About what?

06:20.338 --> 06:21.631
[gunshot]

06:29.347 --> 06:33.810
I couldn't sleep last night, Jug.
I kept thinking about your dad and Pop's

06:33.893 --> 06:36.854
and how maybe we can kill two birds
with one stone.

06:37.438 --> 06:38.689
We can--

06:42.652 --> 06:44.904
Can you meet me at the mayor's office?

06:45.404 --> 06:47.240
Okay, great. I'll get it set. Um...

06:47.323 --> 06:50.118
-Right now I need to call...
-Hey, B, what's up?

06:52.203 --> 06:53.246
[knock on door]

06:57.625 --> 06:59.836
I know you haven't been sleeping
in your room,

06:59.919 --> 07:03.339
so, where exactly
have you been spending your nights?

07:03.422 --> 07:05.508
-[Archie] So, Betty.
-[Veronica] Yes, Betty.

07:05.591 --> 07:07.552
Since you and your dad got home
from the hospital,

07:07.635 --> 07:12.014
she's noticed your room has been
unusually empty and quiet. Why?

07:14.475 --> 07:16.936
So I can... watch the doors.

07:18.104 --> 07:20.314
So I can make sure no one comes in.

07:20.773 --> 07:23.818
I know it sounds crazy,
but the guy who shot my dad

07:23.901 --> 07:25.528
is still out there, Ronnie.

07:26.237 --> 07:30.575
And I'm scared he's gonna... come back
and finish the job.

07:31.784 --> 07:36.330
Archie, you went through something
deeply traumatic.

07:36.956 --> 07:40.418
-Can I make a suggestion?
-Please. Anything.

07:40.501 --> 07:43.838
When I lived in New York,
I saw a therapist once a week

07:43.921 --> 07:47.091
to help me get through all sorts
of Park Avenue drama.

07:47.842 --> 07:50.970
Now, I'm not saying
to go see a therapist, Archie,

07:51.053 --> 07:53.890
but maybe the school counselor could help?

07:59.187 --> 08:03.107
-Mayor McCoy.
-Betty, Jughead, what can I help you with?

08:03.191 --> 08:06.194
So, the Chock'lit Shoppe
is on the verge of closing,

08:06.277 --> 08:10.156
and we want Pop Tate to know
that the town is rallying behind him.

08:10.907 --> 08:15.119
We were thinking that you could make
the building a landmark

08:15.203 --> 08:17.205
or declare a Pop's Day in support.

08:17.914 --> 08:21.125
What if I endorse Pop's
and someone else is shot there?

08:21.209 --> 08:24.545
My priority, as a mayor and as a mother,
is keeping this town safe.

08:25.171 --> 08:27.757
If we have to close Pop's, I'm all for it.

08:27.840 --> 08:32.303
Are you also all for shipping my dad off
to prison for a murder he didn't commit?

08:32.386 --> 08:33.971
What is this, an ambush?

08:34.055 --> 08:36.307
I know you have an in
with the state attorney.

08:36.390 --> 08:39.560
If you could call him
and get my dad a better lawyer?

08:39.644 --> 08:41.896
Your father made some mistakes.

08:42.772 --> 08:45.608
-I'm sure he'll get a fair hearing.
-[Jughead] Mayor McCoy?

08:46.275 --> 08:47.693
Remember this moment.

08:48.486 --> 08:52.615
This is the moment you turned your back
on both Pop Tate and my father.

09:03.292 --> 09:04.126
Midge Klump.

09:05.586 --> 09:07.672
-The Klumpster.
-Reggie.

09:08.673 --> 09:10.883
What do you know about jingle-jangle?

09:10.967 --> 09:14.178
I know you shouldn't say it so loud
on school property.

09:15.388 --> 09:18.891
And that I can score you some.
Who's it for?

09:19.642 --> 09:22.478
-Me and Moose.
-Let me see what I can do.

09:30.403 --> 09:32.113
What's on your mind, Andrews?

09:32.196 --> 09:34.115
Girl troubles? Scabies?

09:35.199 --> 09:38.077
Why are you seeking guidance
from Ms. Burble?

09:38.160 --> 09:39.870
-I'm not.
-Maybe you should.

09:39.954 --> 09:42.373
You look like my nuts
after football practice.

09:42.456 --> 09:46.043
Hey. Do you have anything
that can help keep me awake?

09:46.127 --> 09:47.295
Many things.

09:47.378 --> 09:51.757
Amphetamines, baclofen,
modafinil, jingle-jangle.

09:52.258 --> 09:53.134
Jingle-jangle?

09:54.760 --> 09:57.972
That'll keep you up for days,
in more ways than one.

10:00.057 --> 10:02.268
Why do you need uppers, Wonder Bread?

10:02.351 --> 10:05.813
Until the guy who shot my dad is caught,
I wanna be on high alert.

10:06.564 --> 10:09.734
-Can you help me or not, Reggie?
-I got you, Andrews.

10:13.904 --> 10:15.823
[Betty] We can't let the terrorists win.

10:15.906 --> 10:20.369
We need to host an event at Pop's
that reminds the town of simpler times.

10:20.453 --> 10:23.414
A throwback to when the Shoppe
first opened its doors.

10:23.497 --> 10:27.126
Betty... I like a good milkshake
as much as any girl,

10:27.209 --> 10:33.049
and Pop's puts Serendipity 3's to shame,
but why this hill to die on?

10:37.219 --> 10:40.806
Orange freezes with my mom
and Polly after ballet.

10:41.891 --> 10:44.602
Chicken noodle soup with my dad
after ice-skating.

10:44.685 --> 10:48.481
Grilled cheeses with Archie
on the last day of summer vacation.

10:50.107 --> 10:52.568
[Betty] It's where I met you
for the first time, V.

10:53.527 --> 10:55.529
It's where I met you for the first time.

10:58.032 --> 10:59.200
Also...

11:00.785 --> 11:01.619
Jug.

11:04.705 --> 11:06.415
He may lose his dad...

11:08.084 --> 11:13.631
but maybe I can save this one place
for him, for all of us.

11:14.173 --> 11:15.007
[knocking on door]

11:15.257 --> 11:16.801
Hey, Veronica.

11:17.635 --> 11:18.886
May I speak to you?

11:19.678 --> 11:20.513
Daddy?

11:20.596 --> 11:21.680
-Daddy?
-Daddy?

11:22.223 --> 11:26.602
Every day I was in prison, I thought
about getting back to you and your mother.

11:26.685 --> 11:29.980
I knew it wouldn't be easy.
I knew it would take time.

11:33.651 --> 11:34.819
Meet me halfway.

11:34.902 --> 11:36.862
Don't you think I want to, Daddy?

11:37.446 --> 11:41.117
Don't you think I want everything
to go back to the way it was?

11:41.200 --> 11:44.578
The three of us
walking into some fabulous gala or ball,

11:44.662 --> 11:47.081
you with your two favorite girls.

11:47.790 --> 11:50.334
But... I can't.

11:52.378 --> 11:55.089
The blindfold's off.
I can't put it back on.

11:57.967 --> 11:59.343
I'm sorry.

11:59.969 --> 12:02.972
-I should get back to my friends.
-Yeah. Hey, so...

12:03.055 --> 12:07.935
-are you, uh, planning a dance in there?
-An event to keep Pop's from closing.

12:08.018 --> 12:10.187
-If I can help...
-I'll let you know.

12:12.523 --> 12:15.609
I tried going the legit route.
I talked to the mayor.

12:15.693 --> 12:18.362
It feels like the system is rigged
against us.

12:18.446 --> 12:21.031
What's FP saying? Is he taking this deal?

12:21.115 --> 12:22.741
Not if I can help it.

12:23.367 --> 12:24.201
Tall Boy...

12:26.203 --> 12:30.166
what if we bust him out of jail
before he gets transferred to state?

12:32.460 --> 12:36.464
It's doable. The sheriff's station has
worse security than Riverdale High.

12:36.547 --> 12:39.216
Once he's out,
it's a straight shot up Sweetwater River

12:39.300 --> 12:40.843
until the Canadian border.

12:40.926 --> 12:44.346
You've seen Escape From Alcatraz
a few too many times, kid.

12:44.889 --> 12:47.016
Your dad needs a snake handler.

12:47.099 --> 12:49.643
Someone whose livelihood
depends on snakes,

12:49.727 --> 12:53.397
who's used to dealing with them.
I got someone you should meet.

12:55.107 --> 12:58.444
Humpty and Dumpty.
Just in time to meet our newest recruit.

12:58.527 --> 13:01.030
In addition to my duties as a Pussycat.

13:01.113 --> 13:04.992
And I just wanna say, girls,
I'm so excited to work on my moves

13:05.075 --> 13:08.454
and to be a team player,
as long as I'm in the front.

13:09.497 --> 13:13.501
Wait, Cheryl, does that mean
you're taking the Vixens back from me?

13:14.126 --> 13:17.004
But really, Veronica,
were they ever yours?

13:17.671 --> 13:21.342
Cheryl, we were wondering
if maybe the Vixens would help

13:21.425 --> 13:23.552
at an event to save Pop's.

13:26.972 --> 13:30.809
Oh, Betty, I did not emerge
from the frozen depths of Sweetwater River

13:30.893 --> 13:34.188
nor the flames of Thornhill
to allow my Vixens to sling milkshakes

13:34.271 --> 13:38.567
at some death-cursed diner.
The answer is a double-cherry-on-top no.

13:38.651 --> 13:39.693
[bell rings]

13:42.947 --> 13:43.822
Okay.

13:44.740 --> 13:45.616
Good talk.

13:45.699 --> 13:47.618
[Weatherbee]
May I have everyone's attention?

13:49.787 --> 13:50.746
I have some...

13:51.539 --> 13:52.831
tragic news to share.

13:55.084 --> 13:55.918
Ms. Grundy...

13:57.253 --> 14:00.464
who was a teacher here last semester,
was found...

14:02.258 --> 14:05.511
-murdered in her Greendale home.
-Oh, my God.

14:08.597 --> 14:10.849
[Weatherbee] I know some of you
were students of hers...

14:12.476 --> 14:15.312
and that this news
will be difficult to process.

14:16.772 --> 14:17.815
[inaudible]

14:21.193 --> 14:22.111
[gunshot]

14:28.200 --> 14:29.201
Mr. Andrews?

14:33.414 --> 14:34.707
[Archie] First you get shot.

14:34.790 --> 14:38.168
Then Ms. Grundy is murdered.
All within a matter of days.

14:38.252 --> 14:41.881
What if some crazy person
is going after people I care about?

14:41.964 --> 14:42.965
[sighs]

14:43.048 --> 14:46.468
-What? You think I'm nuts.
-No, son, I think you're scared.

14:46.969 --> 14:48.470
Understandably so.

14:48.554 --> 14:52.224
Truth is, we don't know anything
about what happened to Ms. Grundy.

14:52.308 --> 14:54.894
She's dead. She was killed...

14:55.895 --> 14:57.980
right across Sweetwater River.

14:58.606 --> 14:59.648
I know.

14:59.732 --> 15:01.609
It was a horrible thing.

15:02.902 --> 15:06.196
Don't you wanna find out who did this?
Who's doing this?

15:27.343 --> 15:29.511
I'm, uh...

15:29.845 --> 15:31.221
here for Penny Peabody?

15:38.020 --> 15:41.857
Forgive the office space,
but I'm a firm believer in low overhead.

15:41.941 --> 15:47.029
-Plus, I like being close to my clients.
-Your clients being the Serpents?

15:47.112 --> 15:49.365
Well, I was and still am a Serpent.

15:52.242 --> 15:53.911
They put me through college.

15:54.536 --> 15:55.371
Law school.

15:56.372 --> 15:59.708
Right. Serpents are often
on the other side of the law,

15:59.792 --> 16:03.879
so, having one of their own
on retainer helping out, it's clever.

16:04.964 --> 16:07.174
FP always bragged that you were smart.

16:09.051 --> 16:10.678
Oh, yeah, I know your dad.

16:11.762 --> 16:15.849
And I also know,
from our, um... mutual friends,

16:15.933 --> 16:17.601
the deal he's been offered.

16:18.560 --> 16:19.770
It's garbage.

16:21.438 --> 16:23.899
-Can you help?
-I know the loopholes.

16:23.983 --> 16:25.901
In this case, there are none.

16:25.985 --> 16:29.238
But if you get the victim's family
to forgive him

16:30.072 --> 16:34.243
in front of a judge,
that might shift things in FP's favor.

16:34.785 --> 16:37.997
Instead of 20 years,
he can get time served with parole.

16:38.080 --> 16:39.999
-Oh, that's great.
-Yeah.

16:40.666 --> 16:44.837
Thank-- Uh...
Am I... supposed to pay you, or...?

16:45.462 --> 16:46.422
We're friends.

16:47.965 --> 16:52.720
I do you a favor,
one day, maybe you do me a favor.

16:56.181 --> 16:58.058
Let me know how it goes, will you?

16:59.476 --> 17:01.145
Tell your dad to wear a tie.

17:01.895 --> 17:05.315
You're twitching, Archie,
which means this must be serious.

17:06.400 --> 17:10.237
I think the person who shot my dad
may have murdered Ms. Grundy.

17:11.405 --> 17:14.950
My, my. We've come a long way
since dances at the gym

17:15.034 --> 17:17.494
and varsity football tryouts, haven't we?

17:18.829 --> 17:22.124
You were the first to know anything
about Jason's autopsy.

17:22.207 --> 17:25.252
-Archie's wondering if--
-I can get details on Ms. Grundy's death

17:25.335 --> 17:27.504
and see if they line up
with the attack on Fred.

17:27.588 --> 17:30.883
It would be really helpful
to put Archie's mind at ease.

17:31.884 --> 17:34.261
Fine. I'll reach out
to my ghoulish friend.

17:34.887 --> 17:37.556
Thank you, Mrs. Cooper. Thanks, Betty.

17:38.557 --> 17:39.391
I should go.

17:40.392 --> 17:41.602
I'll call you, Arch.

17:44.855 --> 17:46.190
Spreading ourself thin

17:46.273 --> 17:49.485
as the patron saint of lost causes,
aren't we?

17:50.319 --> 17:52.821
You can cross saving Pop's off your list.

17:53.781 --> 17:56.450
Haven't you heard?
Pop Tate is selling the Shoppe.

17:57.534 --> 17:59.036
What? To who?

17:59.119 --> 18:01.872
To, and you'll love this,
an anonymous buyer.

18:03.040 --> 18:04.041
Ring any bells?

18:07.002 --> 18:07.836
[phone ringing]

18:07.920 --> 18:10.380
-Miss Veronica, I'll take those.
-Oh, thank you, Smithers.

18:11.340 --> 18:12.382
Hey, girl.

18:16.386 --> 18:17.221
What?

18:17.304 --> 18:20.724
Are you buying Pop's
the way you bought the drive-in?

18:20.808 --> 18:22.059
Anonymously?

18:24.103 --> 18:26.355
And are you doing this just to buy me?

18:27.314 --> 18:30.317
Yesterday did you think,
"Veronica's working so hard

18:30.400 --> 18:33.237
to save the Chock'lit Shoppe,
I'll save it for her."

18:33.320 --> 18:35.656
Veronica, I'm not buying Pop's.

18:36.240 --> 18:39.409
Now, please, lower your voice and sit...

18:40.494 --> 18:41.912
so we can speak civilly.

18:43.080 --> 18:46.708
-You wanna talk, Dad?
-That's all I've wanted. A fair hearing.

18:46.792 --> 18:47.876
To explain myself.

18:50.420 --> 18:51.421
Okay.

18:52.673 --> 18:54.591
Let's talk about Mr. Andrews.

18:57.469 --> 19:01.265
Mom asked him to sell his portion
of the SoDale project.

19:01.765 --> 19:04.268
And the day after he rejected the offer...

19:06.436 --> 19:08.730
he was shot in Pop's.

19:11.859 --> 19:14.111
-Was it your doing?
-[Hermione] Veronica.

19:14.194 --> 19:16.822
-First you accuse me, then your father?
-No.

19:17.322 --> 19:18.157
No.

19:18.866 --> 19:20.075
I didn't shoot Fred.

19:21.243 --> 19:23.245
Nor did I hire someone to do it.

19:26.123 --> 19:28.625
I was your fiercest protector, Dad.

19:30.169 --> 19:35.007
Ask Mom. Whenever somebody called you
the devil incarnate, I defended you.

19:36.550 --> 19:39.428
I kept telling myself, "He's not that bad.

19:40.971 --> 19:42.431
You can forgive him."

19:45.434 --> 19:46.977
And then you sent me this.

19:56.361 --> 19:58.155
A letter threatening you, Mom.

20:07.748 --> 20:11.418
That's the kind of man
you're letting back into our lives.

20:18.842 --> 20:19.676
[Hermione] Veronica...

20:21.845 --> 20:23.764
your father didn't write this.

20:25.682 --> 20:26.516
I did.

20:30.187 --> 20:31.396
I don't understand.

20:31.480 --> 20:34.274
I needed you to testify
on your father's behalf.

20:35.525 --> 20:39.529
So, I wrote this letter
threatening myself, not your father.

20:39.613 --> 20:40.447
[Hiram] Yeah.

20:41.114 --> 20:42.366
She did it for us...

20:43.450 --> 20:44.451
to survive.

20:45.452 --> 20:47.120
So we can be a family again.

20:50.290 --> 20:51.917
You two deserve each other.

20:59.341 --> 21:01.218
[Jughead]
It's not exactly downsizing, is it?

21:01.301 --> 21:02.427
[knocking on door]

21:03.553 --> 21:04.429
Hobo.

21:04.930 --> 21:05.973
Bride of hobo.

21:06.390 --> 21:07.891
Welcome to Thistlehouse.

21:07.975 --> 21:10.394
Mother's in the conservatory. Follow me.

21:19.278 --> 21:21.655
Thank you for sitting down with us.

21:21.738 --> 21:24.408
Of course, Betty. You're family.

21:26.660 --> 21:27.536
[Jughead] Okay.

21:28.578 --> 21:31.164
The reason we're here...

21:31.707 --> 21:37.296
FP's lawyer thinks that if the family
of the victim shows mercy--

21:37.379 --> 21:38.755
Mercy.

21:40.674 --> 21:42.175
That's why you're here?

21:43.635 --> 21:46.972
Well, it's an appeal for leniency
from you...

21:48.432 --> 21:50.100
to reduce my dad's sentence.

21:50.767 --> 21:53.270
Where was your father's mercy
when I spent those nights

21:53.353 --> 21:54.855
walking Thornhill in agony,

21:54.938 --> 21:58.734
obsessing over what was happening
to J.J., imagining the worst?

21:58.817 --> 22:01.445
Where was it
when I slept under the same roof

22:01.528 --> 22:04.156
-as a killer night after night?
-Cheryl.

22:05.073 --> 22:06.867
FP didn't kill Jason.

22:07.784 --> 22:10.287
Okay? That was your dad.

22:10.370 --> 22:11.705
You saw the video.

22:11.788 --> 22:16.168
If it were up to me,
I'd watch FP fry in the electric chair.

22:16.710 --> 22:19.796
We need this sordid chapter
closed forever,

22:19.880 --> 22:22.341
and FP is the last loose end to tie up.

22:22.424 --> 22:25.469
I will not have a living,
breathing reminder

22:25.552 --> 22:28.722
of the darkest chapter of my life
walking the streets of Riverdale.

22:30.932 --> 22:34.186
What do we do now
that Cheryl's gone full Poison Ivy?

22:34.269 --> 22:36.521
Blackmail, extortion.

22:37.856 --> 22:41.693
If they weren't literally an orphan
and a widow, I would do it.

22:50.452 --> 22:53.622
[man] Lacerations on the neck.
Her trachea's crushed.

22:53.705 --> 22:57.793
Broken veins in her eyes,
and the skin tears suggest brutality.

22:57.876 --> 22:59.503
This is a crime of passion.

23:00.170 --> 23:03.590
Hatred. He wanted to feel her struggle
as she died.

23:05.801 --> 23:08.470
Tell me, Mrs. Cooper,
did you know the victim?

23:09.971 --> 23:10.806
No.

23:17.729 --> 23:19.356
[man] Give me your wallet!

23:22.609 --> 23:23.527
[grunting]

23:27.739 --> 23:28.949
[Reggie] Stop it.

23:29.991 --> 23:31.034
Stop!

23:31.660 --> 23:32.619
It's me.

23:34.287 --> 23:36.706
-Are you insane?
-What are you doing here?

23:36.790 --> 23:40.001
Delivering your uppers.
Clearly the last thing you need.

23:41.753 --> 23:45.674
-You've lost it, Andrews.
-You're the one here wearing this hood.

23:45.757 --> 23:49.177
It's called a prank.
I didn't expect you to attack me.

23:49.261 --> 23:52.139
What if I had been the guy, huh?

23:52.222 --> 23:55.809
-You would have just tackled him?
-Yeah. Damn right.

23:55.892 --> 23:58.520
He has a gun, Andrews.

23:58.603 --> 23:59.771
He's shot people.

24:00.897 --> 24:04.109
Only a dumb-ass lunatic
brings a bat to a gunfight.

24:09.030 --> 24:12.951
There was no sign of forced entry,
which probably means she knew her killer.

24:13.785 --> 24:17.247
The police don't know
if any of her belongings were taken.

24:19.332 --> 24:20.375
How, uh...?

24:21.710 --> 24:23.170
How did Ms. Grundy die?

24:24.796 --> 24:27.174
The autopsy showed
that she was strangled...

24:28.592 --> 24:31.094
with something the killer grabbed on hand.

24:32.304 --> 24:34.139
A cello bow, of all things.

24:37.767 --> 24:40.437
There was a struggle. She fought back.

24:40.979 --> 24:43.857
But, Archie, this was a crime of passion,

24:44.482 --> 24:47.861
in another town,
with a completely different murder weapon.

24:49.571 --> 24:53.575
The likelihood of these two crimes
being connected seems slim.

24:54.910 --> 24:56.161
Son?

24:58.246 --> 25:00.999
If I say what I'm thinking,
you'll think I'm crazy.

25:03.418 --> 25:05.503
Probably Mrs. Cooper is right.

25:07.505 --> 25:09.341
Probably they're not connected.

25:11.134 --> 25:14.262
So, why'd you do it? Did they make you
an offer you couldn't refuse?

25:14.346 --> 25:17.432
-Who's buying it? Do you know?
-[Pop] It shames me to say...

25:18.600 --> 25:20.936
-ChugMo.
-The liquor-store chain?

25:22.771 --> 25:26.399
-Could I make a request for a last supper?
-Anything you want.

25:27.108 --> 25:29.319
It's not for me. It's for my dad.

25:29.986 --> 25:33.031
He's facing 20 years
of that weird meat loaf

25:33.114 --> 25:34.616
that they serve prisoners.

25:34.699 --> 25:37.202
So, barring an 11th-hour miracle, I was...

25:38.245 --> 25:41.665
hoping, for his last meal in Riverdale,
that you could make his favorite.

25:41.748 --> 25:46.753
Fried chicken, corn bread, onion rings
and orange freeze, if memory serves.

25:46.836 --> 25:48.964
That's very Rain Man of you, Pop.

25:49.047 --> 25:50.715
Been doing this a long time.

25:51.424 --> 25:53.969
Thought I'd be doing it
until the day I die.

25:54.886 --> 25:55.720
[Betty] This is...

25:57.597 --> 25:58.807
unacceptable.

26:00.934 --> 26:02.352
-What?
-Just everything.

26:03.561 --> 26:07.357
-Have you officially sold the diner?
-The contract's being drawn up.

26:07.440 --> 26:08.400
Do not sign it.

26:08.984 --> 26:10.986
Okay? Do not give up. Either of you.

26:11.820 --> 26:15.532
I can fix this, all right?
I will fix this, okay?

26:16.199 --> 26:17.033
Bye.

26:28.295 --> 26:29.546
[door closes, then Cheryl gasps]

26:30.672 --> 26:34.050
-Give a girl a warning, will you?
-You want closure.

26:35.719 --> 26:38.221
-I wanna help my boyfriend's dad.
-I told you--

26:38.305 --> 26:39.806
And I'm telling you...

26:41.308 --> 26:43.393
to help FP or--

26:43.476 --> 26:44.894
Or what?

26:45.562 --> 26:48.732
Or I wide-release the video
of your father shooting Jason.

26:50.817 --> 26:53.611
Try having closure
with that out in the world.

26:55.322 --> 26:58.658
I thought you, uh, gave that
damn thumb drive to Sheriff Keller.

26:58.742 --> 27:01.786
No, not before I saved a copy
onto Jughead's laptop.

27:03.788 --> 27:09.836
One click and the darkest chapter
of your family's twisted psychodrama

27:09.919 --> 27:12.005
becomes a viral sensation.

27:13.173 --> 27:14.632
Are you threatening me?

27:16.551 --> 27:17.385
This?

27:18.803 --> 27:19.846
No.

27:20.472 --> 27:24.893
No, this is... fun girl talk.

27:28.438 --> 27:30.940
You could save a man's life.

27:32.692 --> 27:33.902
Think about that.

27:35.570 --> 27:39.074
A nice ending to a sad story.

27:42.160 --> 27:45.830
If I testify, you're giving me that video

27:46.498 --> 27:50.460
and a guarantee that all copies
in your possession will be erased.

27:52.128 --> 27:53.129
You have my word.

27:55.131 --> 27:55.965
Also...

27:57.384 --> 27:59.928
I need the Vixens for Retro Night.

28:03.973 --> 28:06.559
You're a stone-cold bitch, Betty Cooper.

28:16.361 --> 28:20.073
I don't have red hair and broad shoulders.

28:20.156 --> 28:22.325
Or a blond ponytail, for that matter.

28:24.661 --> 28:25.745
Do you wanna talk?

28:31.543 --> 28:34.921
You were ready to walk away from your dad.

28:36.297 --> 28:39.426
And now you're crusading for his freedom.

28:40.719 --> 28:41.553
What changed?

28:44.264 --> 28:45.098
He did.

28:46.182 --> 28:47.267
He made an effort.

28:48.351 --> 28:50.687
Took another swing at being a good dad.

28:53.606 --> 28:54.941
But don't you think...

28:55.900 --> 28:57.694
some people can't change?

28:58.820 --> 29:01.614
Like it's just in their DNA to be bad?

29:04.409 --> 29:07.370
I'm not gonna presume to know
what lies in your father's heart.

29:08.204 --> 29:09.914
But Archie's dad almost died.

29:11.082 --> 29:14.169
And my dad is going away for 20 years.

29:16.004 --> 29:20.842
If there's even a 0.0001 percent chance
that your dad is trying--

29:20.925 --> 29:22.177
I get it.

29:24.512 --> 29:26.473
Thank you, Jughead.

29:27.682 --> 29:30.935
Sheriff, I believe the man who shot my dad
is the person

29:31.019 --> 29:34.105
that killed Ms. Grundy,
and I think I know who it is.

29:34.731 --> 29:37.442
Well, that's quite a statement, Archie.

29:37.525 --> 29:39.778
Ms. Grundy had an abusive ex-husband.

29:40.528 --> 29:42.155
She moved to Riverdale to get away.

29:42.238 --> 29:45.158
She kept a gun in her car
in case he'd come back.

29:45.784 --> 29:47.619
And how do you know all this?

29:48.369 --> 29:50.371
Because she and I were...

29:53.416 --> 29:54.584
We were close.

29:54.667 --> 29:57.128
And I'm thinking he found out about me.

29:58.713 --> 30:01.090
Ms. Grundy was killed with a cello bow.

30:01.174 --> 30:05.678
I gave her one before she left Riverdale.
I'm betting it's the murder weapon.

30:06.888 --> 30:09.307
Can't you see? He's sending me a message.

30:09.390 --> 30:11.226
Your theory's wrong, Archie.

30:11.309 --> 30:14.562
My counterparts at Greendale
already brought in her ex.

30:14.646 --> 30:16.815
And he has an airtight alibi.

30:24.531 --> 30:25.990
Maybe everyone's right.

30:29.369 --> 30:30.745
Maybe I am going crazy.

30:38.169 --> 30:39.546
[Kevin] Hey, has Betty called?

30:40.797 --> 30:44.425
Not yet.
Let's pray Cheryl comes through for them.

30:45.134 --> 30:47.554
[man] Ms. Blossom,
you may proceed with your statement.

30:47.637 --> 30:51.224
Your Honor, I speak for myself
and my mother when I say...

30:52.392 --> 30:56.396
we forgive FP Jones for the part he played
in covering up my brother's murder.

30:57.939 --> 31:00.358
And we humbly ask the court for leniency.

31:02.485 --> 31:04.445
FP's guilt has been blown
out of proportion

31:04.529 --> 31:07.198
to satiate what my father's suicide
denied us.

31:08.658 --> 31:09.742
Closure.

31:10.326 --> 31:14.998
As much as I sympathize, I can't ignore
the quality of Mr. Jones' crimes.

31:15.081 --> 31:17.792
There were no extenuating circumstances.

31:23.756 --> 31:25.216
My father threatened him.

31:25.842 --> 31:28.344
I overheard them talking in Daddy's study.

31:29.429 --> 31:32.390
Daddy said he'd hurt Jughead
if FP didn't comply.

31:36.477 --> 31:38.396
Is that extenuating enough?

31:41.566 --> 31:44.068
[judge] In light of these revelations,

31:44.694 --> 31:46.905
I suggest that we take a step back

31:46.988 --> 31:49.949
and reevaluate certain aspects
of the case.

31:50.909 --> 31:53.661
At which time, we will revisit sentencing.

31:54.871 --> 31:55.705
Adjourned.

32:03.713 --> 32:04.547
Is that a win?

32:05.298 --> 32:06.674
It's a delay, so, yeah.

32:18.895 --> 32:19.812
No one's here.

32:21.105 --> 32:22.065
No one's coming.

32:22.857 --> 32:24.484
It's still early, okay?

32:29.364 --> 32:30.615
Mom.

32:31.449 --> 32:34.702
-Did you come to gloat?
-Don't be so cynical, Elizabeth.

32:34.786 --> 32:37.789
I came to write my next story
over one last root-beer float.

32:37.872 --> 32:40.333
I'm calling it "Requiem for Pop's."

32:40.416 --> 32:41.834
Can I get a quote, dear?

32:43.127 --> 32:44.754
You're a fiend, mother.

32:45.296 --> 32:48.299
But this is one obituary
you're not gonna write.

32:51.844 --> 32:52.929
All right.

32:53.388 --> 32:58.267
Two strawberries, one vanilla,
and one chocolate with extra malt.

33:01.729 --> 33:02.563
[clears throat]

33:03.606 --> 33:06.150
Why did you broadcast
all over social media

33:06.234 --> 33:09.821
that the Pussycats would be doing
a free concert here?

33:09.904 --> 33:12.323
I knew if I asked, you would have said--

33:12.407 --> 33:16.202
No. If my mom even hears
that I set foot in this place--

33:16.285 --> 33:18.246
Josie, you care about this place.

33:18.329 --> 33:20.873
I know you do.
I see you here all the time.

33:21.708 --> 33:24.502
Betty, even if I wanted to help,
I'm down a Cat.

33:24.585 --> 33:26.879
-Valerie has norovirus.
-I don't mind stepping in.

33:26.963 --> 33:30.633
If you can be a River Vixen,
Josie, I can be a Pussycat.

33:31.676 --> 33:33.845
As long as it's a cover,
I'll know the lyrics.

33:33.928 --> 33:36.055
You do love your cheese fries.

33:39.434 --> 33:40.601

You made it.

34:38.159 --> 34:39.869
-You feeling okay?
-Yeah.

34:41.037 --> 34:42.538
Just taking deep breaths.

34:43.164 --> 34:44.248
I'm proud of you.

Come on.

You take a booth,

I'm not here to fight.
I'm here to be supportive.

35:02.225 --> 35:03.851
Dad, Mom.

35:04.644 --> 35:05.770
I've been thinking.

35:06.813 --> 35:11.400
Tonight is a new beginning for Pop's,
and maybe it can be for us, too.

35:12.276 --> 35:14.695
That's up to you.
If that's what you want.

35:15.363 --> 35:16.864
Let's try.

35:17.365 --> 35:21.202
-But, you guys, total transparency, okay?
-Yes. Of course.

35:21.953 --> 35:24.330
From now on. In the spirit of that,

35:24.413 --> 35:28.167
I propose that Lodge Industries
make a charitable contribution.

35:48.771 --> 35:49.689
Relax, Betty.

35:49.772 --> 35:54.193
I'm sure they're just here to enjoy
Pop's world-class burgers and service.

35:55.778 --> 35:57.405
Just like me.

35:57.488 --> 36:01.868
Ugh, you two are like chimps in captivity,
grooming and picking lice off each other.

36:02.869 --> 36:06.581
Mark this day in your diary.
I lied under oath for you.

36:06.664 --> 36:09.167
-Thank God I'm quick on my feet.
-Cheryl...

36:11.669 --> 36:12.587
thank you.

36:14.839 --> 36:16.340
Honor your promise to me.

36:26.225 --> 36:27.894
Hi, Midge, Moose.

36:30.354 --> 36:31.856
I've got your jingle-jangle.

36:32.398 --> 36:33.482
[camera clicks]

36:38.988 --> 36:40.907
[Pop] I gotta put her on the spot.

36:40.990 --> 36:46.120
It's thanks to this young lady here
that Pop's gets to stay open tonight,

36:46.204 --> 36:48.956
tomorrow, as long as you folks
keep coming.

36:50.458 --> 36:51.626
[cheering]

36:53.836 --> 36:56.631
Thanks also to the Lodge family

36:56.714 --> 37:00.384
for a donation they just made
that gives us a little cushion

37:00.468 --> 37:02.595
to weather any storm that might come up.

37:03.763 --> 37:04.805
[cheering]

37:07.266 --> 37:09.727
I didn't know
we were in the charity business.

37:09.810 --> 37:10.895
Oh, we're not.

37:12.230 --> 37:15.024
As of five minutes ago,
we, uh, own this diner.

37:15.900 --> 37:20.154
In exchange for his silence,
I told Tate he could stay on as manager.

37:22.031 --> 37:23.741
Nice to have you back, Hiram.

37:25.534 --> 37:28.162
Thank you for saying
you wrote that letter.

37:28.871 --> 37:31.332
Veronica never would've forgiven me
for that.

37:31.415 --> 37:33.834
Once again, your loyalty knows no bounds.

37:40.883 --> 37:43.552
Ronnie, should I introduce myself
to your dad?

37:43.970 --> 37:47.765
You've faced enough dragons for one night.
Next time, Archiekins.

37:48.391 --> 37:52.311
[Betty] So, I guess tonight is a win
for the good guys.

37:53.646 --> 37:56.065
A rare win, but yes.

37:56.649 --> 37:57.984
Thanks to you, Betty.

37:58.067 --> 37:58.943
You okay?

38:01.946 --> 38:03.489
I'm here with you guys.

38:04.448 --> 38:05.908
So, yeah, I think so.

38:17.044 --> 38:19.171
[Cheryl] I have a present for you.

38:23.759 --> 38:25.553
The video of Daddy and Jason.

38:29.932 --> 38:30.766
All cued up.

38:34.854 --> 38:36.355
It might bring you peace.

38:45.031 --> 38:46.991
[man] Evening, Mr. and Mrs. Lodge.

38:47.074 --> 38:50.494
-You must be Veronica.
-I am. Where's Smithers?

38:50.578 --> 38:53.080
He didn't he tell you?
His mother fell ill.

38:53.164 --> 38:56.667
He went overseas to care for her.
Did he leave a forwarding address?

38:56.751 --> 38:59.295
-I'll try to track one down, sir.
-Thank you, Andre.

39:08.888 --> 39:09.930
[phone ringing]

39:14.060 --> 39:16.729
-Hello?
-You went to see Penny Peabody?

39:17.313 --> 39:20.858
-[FP] You asked her for help?
-Dad. Hey.

39:21.150 --> 39:24.653
Uh, yeah. We didn't have a choice.
Is something wrong?

39:24.737 --> 39:26.614
Did you--? Did you pay her?

39:27.239 --> 39:30.409
-No, she said it was a favor.
-[FP] Jughead, listen to me.

39:30.993 --> 39:34.830
Do not contact her again.
If she reaches out, don't respond.

39:35.456 --> 39:37.166
You do not wanna be in bed

39:37.249 --> 39:39.085
-with the Snake Charmer.
-[Jughead] Why--?

39:39.877 --> 39:40.711
Dad?

39:52.431 --> 39:55.935
You do know that several drug deals
went down here tonight?

39:57.186 --> 39:59.313
-What?
-And if you think Hiram Lodge,

39:59.397 --> 40:03.526
Riverdale's answer to Scarface,
helped Pop Tate for altruistic reasons,

40:03.609 --> 40:06.821
-I have a bridge to sell you.
-Mom--

40:06.904 --> 40:09.365
The Serpents have now officially
crossed the tracks

40:09.448 --> 40:12.827
and have a toehold on the Northside,
so, congratulations.

40:12.910 --> 40:17.706
You're almost single-handedly responsible
for giving crime a haven in Riverdale.

[Jughead] And far from the glow of Pop's
neon sign, on Sweetwater Bridge,

40:26.465 --> 40:30.469

a secret rendezvous with Dilton Doiley.

40:33.514 --> 40:34.390
Hey, Dilton.

40:35.975 --> 40:38.727
Hey, Archie. I got what you asked for.

40:54.410 --> 40:55.494
I'm not crazy.

40:56.662 --> 40:59.415
The guy's still out there.
It's for protection.

41:00.541 --> 41:01.459
Sure, Archie.

41:02.376 --> 41:03.502
Whatever you say.

41:04.378 --> 41:08.174

in weeks, Archie would sleep...
