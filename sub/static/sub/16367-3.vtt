00:26.126 --> 00:27.326
Good evening.

00:27.328 --> 00:28.894
I'm Helen Mirren,

00:28.896 --> 00:32.765
and you're watching
"Documentary Now!" season 51.

00:32.767 --> 00:35.401
Acclaimed monologist
Parker Gail

00:35.403 --> 00:38.303
made memoir into theater
for over 30 years.

00:38.305 --> 00:42.975
But when he teamed up with
director Harrison Renzi in 1987,

00:42.977 --> 00:46.545
memoir, theater,
and documentary merged

00:46.547 --> 00:48.180
to produce a classic.

00:48.182 --> 00:51.450
We now proudly present
Parker Gail's

00:51.452 --> 00:53.952
"Location is Everything."

01:36.229 --> 01:39.598
I learned we were being forced
out of our loft on Broome Street

01:39.600 --> 01:41.800
when my girlfriend Ramona
and I were lying in bed

01:41.802 --> 01:44.269
one Sunday morning in January.

01:44.271 --> 01:45.737
It was 10 degrees outside

01:45.739 --> 01:47.339
and the radiator pipes
were clanging...

01:47.341 --> 01:48.907
Bing!
Bing!

01:48.909 --> 01:51.477
Like there were little Dutchmen
inside them with hammers,

01:51.479 --> 01:53.045
swinging as they pivot
left to right

01:53.047 --> 01:56.782
like some sort of pre-war
SoHo heat pipe cuckoo clock.

01:56.784 --> 01:59.518
And I started to free-associate
about the little Dutchmen

01:59.520 --> 02:01.453
living in my pipes.

02:01.455 --> 02:02.788
What do they do
during the summer

02:02.790 --> 02:04.189
when the heat was off?

02:04.191 --> 02:06.291
Whether they summered
in the kitchen faucet

02:06.293 --> 02:08.526
to make it sputter...

02:08.529 --> 02:10.062
Like the sprinkler
we had growing up

02:10.064 --> 02:12.531
in Foster-Glocester,
Rhode Island,

02:12.533 --> 02:15.467
the summer my father left.

02:15.469 --> 02:17.736
And I would sit on the lawn
with my brother, Chipper,

02:17.738 --> 02:19.638
and we would watch the sprinkler
have this kind of

02:19.640 --> 02:21.206
schizophrenic argument
with itself.

02:21.208 --> 02:23.742
You know,
it would spray one way...

02:23.744 --> 02:25.277
And then its head would shake
the other way...

02:26.547 --> 02:27.813
And meanwhile,
my parents were inside

02:27.815 --> 02:31.183
figuring out
how to tell the kids.

02:31.185 --> 02:33.085
And then I realized
I'm not just free-associating.

02:33.087 --> 02:35.354
I'm actually...
I'm actually talking out loud.

02:35.356 --> 02:38.690
And Ramona says, "Cool it with
the sprinkler sounds, Parker!

02:38.692 --> 02:39.992
"Look at this!

02:39.994 --> 02:42.294
They're building
a Stereo City here."

02:42.296 --> 02:44.163
And I say, "What's so surprising
about that?

02:44.165 --> 02:45.731
"The neighborhood's
turning over.

02:45.733 --> 02:48.333
"The flophouses now sell
designer jeans

02:48.335 --> 02:52.571
and the discotheques
are now selling froyo."

02:59.646 --> 03:01.146
And Ramona says,
"No, Parker,

03:01.148 --> 03:03.315
"they're not building a
Stereo City in our neighborhood,

03:03.317 --> 03:04.483
"they're building one here!

03:04.485 --> 03:06.051
59 Broome Street!"

03:06.053 --> 03:07.853
And she shows me
the "New York Daily News"

03:07.855 --> 03:09.188
and there it is
in black and white!

03:09.190 --> 03:11.190
Approved plans for our building
to be torn down

03:11.192 --> 03:13.859
and for a temple of speakers
and CD towers

03:13.861 --> 03:16.628
and cassette tapes
and earphones

03:16.630 --> 03:21.233
to be built on the very site
where we were just making love.

03:21.235 --> 03:22.568
And I should tell you,

03:22.570 --> 03:25.904
i-it had been my loft at first.

03:25.906 --> 03:26.972
Okay?

03:26.974 --> 03:28.674
And when I met Ramona,
she sort of...

03:28.676 --> 03:30.742
she sort of colonized the place,
you know,

03:30.744 --> 03:32.311
like a...
like a feminine Neil Armstrong.

03:32.313 --> 03:34.546
She came in and said,
"I think a flower pot

03:34.548 --> 03:37.849
would look nice by the window."
Thunk!

03:37.851 --> 03:40.686
Then suddenly, her blouses
and cold cream

03:40.688 --> 03:42.788
and Sucret Tins
and mohair throws

03:42.790 --> 03:43.989
were all over the apartment,

03:43.991 --> 03:45.891
until one day she said,
"Parker!

03:45.893 --> 03:48.193
"If you insist
I sleep here every night,

03:48.195 --> 03:50.729
"and if I have to keep
all my stuff here,

03:50.731 --> 03:52.998
"then I should stop paying rent
on my apartment

03:53.000 --> 03:56.201
and just move in, right?"

03:56.203 --> 03:59.671
And that is how I asked Ramona
to live with me.

03:59.673 --> 04:01.373
No. No.
No, no, no.

04:01.375 --> 04:03.375
that is not what happened.

04:03.377 --> 04:04.910
Okay, hi, I'm Ramona,

04:04.912 --> 04:07.045
and that is not what happened.

04:07.047 --> 04:09.948
He begged me
to move in with him.

04:09.950 --> 04:11.817
He begged me.

04:11.819 --> 04:13.585
For starters,
I never liked sleeping there.

04:13.587 --> 04:15.954
It's a seven-story walk-up.

04:15.956 --> 04:18.190
It smelled like yogurt.

04:18.192 --> 04:19.757
He would eat plain yogurt
in the bed

04:19.760 --> 04:21.493
and then chuck the containers
over the dresser

04:21.495 --> 04:23.595
and yell,
"Bye-bye, yogurt!"

04:23.597 --> 04:27.299
So I say, "Parker, I don't think
I can sleep here anymore."

04:27.301 --> 04:28.800
He starts crying.

04:28.802 --> 04:31.270
He says he's terrified
to sleep there alone

04:31.272 --> 04:34.406
because there are tiny Dutchmen
that live in the heat pipes.

04:34.408 --> 04:36.942
And I say, "Okay, Parker,
that's very clever.

04:36.944 --> 04:38.410
You're free-associating."

04:38.412 --> 04:40.712
And then he said,
"I'm not free-associating

04:40.714 --> 04:43.215
"I truly believe
that there are tiny Dutchmen

04:43.217 --> 04:45.217
"banging hammers
in my heat pipes.

04:45.219 --> 04:47.552
They summer in the kitchen
and they're going to kill me."

04:48.789 --> 04:52.090
I was like...

04:52.092 --> 04:55.961
I mean, you know, being single
in New York, it's like...

04:58.399 --> 05:00.832
I mean, he was kind of cute,
you know,

05:00.834 --> 05:03.635
and he liked dancing, so...

05:03.637 --> 05:05.037
I didn't want to break up.

05:05.039 --> 05:06.204
The next day,

05:06.206 --> 05:08.140
we get a letter
from our landlord.

05:08.142 --> 05:10.909
"59 Broome Street's being turned
into a Stereo City.

05:10.911 --> 05:13.845
Our building is being
demolished."

05:13.847 --> 05:16.415
The plans for the construction
are these.

05:19.118 --> 05:22.454
The building next door starts
being torn down that day.

05:25.425 --> 05:29.161
And that's when Ramona's
environmental illness kicks in.

05:29.163 --> 05:31.997
Ramona
has environmental illness,

05:31.999 --> 05:35.100
which means she's allergic
to the environment,

05:35.102 --> 05:37.536
which is all groovy if you live
above the ozone layer,

05:37.538 --> 05:40.972
but if you're stuck down here,
sorry, Sally.

05:40.974 --> 05:42.574
Ramona says her head hurts.

05:42.576 --> 05:44.109
Ramona says her stomach hurts.

05:44.111 --> 05:45.944
Ramona says
the room is spinning.

05:45.946 --> 05:47.979
Ramona goes for the door

05:47.981 --> 05:49.915
and runs down to
the urgent care clinic

05:49.917 --> 05:51.116
on Sixth Avenue.

05:51.118 --> 05:52.884
She has that Jewish thing

05:52.886 --> 05:55.253
of when in doubt,
hospital!

05:56.357 --> 05:58.390
I don't have
environmental illness,

05:58.392 --> 05:59.224
okay?

05:59.226 --> 06:00.992
I keep getting food poisoning

06:00.994 --> 06:04.262
constantly because Parker
refuses to eat at anywhere

06:04.264 --> 06:05.897
that doesn't have a $4 entree.

06:05.899 --> 06:07.799
Also, I walked to the hospital

06:07.801 --> 06:09.434
because Parker refused
to pay for a cab.

06:09.436 --> 06:11.870
Also, not everything that I do
is because I'm Jewish,

06:11.872 --> 06:13.305
and he may want to watch it
with that.

06:13.307 --> 06:16.241
Anyway, I'm being kicked out
of my home.

06:16.243 --> 06:18.043
Home.

06:18.045 --> 06:20.078
Home going away.

06:20.080 --> 06:21.380
Father's moving out,

06:21.382 --> 06:22.814
and suddenly,
I'm back in that summer

06:22.816 --> 06:24.516
in Foster-Glocester,
Rhode Island,

06:24.518 --> 06:26.852
when my father sat us
on the wicker furniture

06:26.854 --> 06:28.086
on the front porch and told us

06:28.088 --> 06:30.622
he was going to live
somewhere else

06:30.624 --> 06:32.224
with another woman,

06:32.226 --> 06:34.593
and that Mother and Father
would not be together anymore.

06:34.595 --> 06:36.595
He was 30
when his parents got divorced.

06:36.597 --> 06:38.296
And I want my mother
and father to be together,

06:38.298 --> 06:40.599
and... and my brother, Chipper,
he takes me by the hand

06:40.601 --> 06:42.000
and... and...
and we leave the house

06:42.002 --> 06:43.869
and we head to the...
the Foster Fair,

06:43.871 --> 06:45.704
a big summer fair
with a Tilt-A-Whirl

06:45.706 --> 06:48.640
and cotton candy and...
and tears are stinging my cheeks

06:48.642 --> 06:49.941
and I hear the hot dog vendor.

06:49.943 --> 06:51.109
The hot dog vendor,
he's yelling,

06:51.111 --> 06:52.778
"Hot dogs!
Hot dogs!"

06:52.780 --> 06:54.146
And Chipper's telling me
everything's gonna be okay.

06:54.148 --> 06:55.213
"Parker, don't you worry."

06:55.215 --> 06:56.615
And
"Hot dogs! Hot dogs!"

06:56.617 --> 06:57.883
"Don't worry," Chipper says.

06:57.885 --> 06:59.084
"It'll be like
having two homes."

06:59.086 --> 07:00.952
"Hot dogs!
Hot dogs!

07:00.954 --> 07:02.020
Hot dogs!"

07:06.126 --> 07:09.261
And even though we were never
allowed food between meals,

07:09.263 --> 07:13.298
my brother bought me
two frankfurters.

07:13.300 --> 07:14.866
With mustard.

07:15.735 --> 07:17.402
And...
I ate them up.

07:17.404 --> 07:18.203
I ate them up.

07:18.205 --> 07:19.504
I guzzled up a cream soda

07:19.506 --> 07:20.972
and, oh,
I'm in bliss.

07:20.974 --> 07:23.341
And then I realize that...
the table is wobbling!

07:23.343 --> 07:25.377
The table is wobbling!
This is very distracting!

07:25.379 --> 07:26.645
This is not part
of the monologue.

07:26.647 --> 07:27.746
This is areal problem for me.

07:27.748 --> 07:29.047
Guys?

07:29.049 --> 07:30.615
Someone come in here
and fix the table

07:30.617 --> 07:32.517
or I won't be able
to concentrate on my monologue

07:32.519 --> 07:34.152
or be able to free-associate

07:34.154 --> 07:36.822
or recall the time I made oral
love to my Russian roommate.

07:36.824 --> 07:38.623
And the table is fixed,

07:38.625 --> 07:40.592
order's restored,

07:40.594 --> 07:43.762
and I can now move on
with the monologue.

07:43.764 --> 07:45.597
Actually, too much water.

07:45.599 --> 07:47.632
I have to go to the bathroom.

07:57.710 --> 07:59.478
I need to go to the bathroom.

08:12.793 --> 08:14.259
We have to move.

08:14.261 --> 08:16.895
Ramona wanted to move to
one of these elevator buildings

08:16.897 --> 08:18.430
with the green awnings.

08:18.432 --> 08:20.699
You know, the kind that always
have a neo-Greek name

08:20.701 --> 08:22.501
like "The Promethean"?

08:22.503 --> 08:24.035
But where to move?

08:24.037 --> 08:25.370
York Avenue?

08:25.372 --> 08:26.505
First Avenue?

08:26.507 --> 08:27.506
Second Avenue?

08:27.508 --> 08:28.507
Third Avenue?

08:28.509 --> 08:29.307
Park?

08:29.309 --> 08:31.176
Madison?
Fifth Avenue?

08:31.178 --> 08:32.677
Avenue of the Americas?

08:32.679 --> 08:35.179
Broadway?

08:35.182 --> 08:37.749
And...
I'm overwhelmed by this.

08:37.751 --> 08:39.083
I'm overwhelmed.

08:39.086 --> 08:41.653
I have to... I have to...
I have to get out.

08:41.655 --> 08:43.121
I have to move.
I have to...

08:43.123 --> 08:45.290
I have to ground myself.

08:45.292 --> 08:49.895
So I go to the park
and I begin to practice tai chi.

08:49.897 --> 08:52.097
I'm focusing on my breath.

08:52.099 --> 08:54.699
The fluid movement
while I do the water sign.

08:56.036 --> 08:59.871
And a little boy, he...
comes up to me.

08:59.873 --> 09:01.339
And he says,

09:01.341 --> 09:03.808
"What are you doing, mister?"

09:03.810 --> 09:06.144
I'm practicing tai chi.

09:06.146 --> 09:08.813
"Is that like fighting, mister?"

09:08.815 --> 09:10.215
It's sort of like fighting,

09:10.217 --> 09:12.150
but it's...
fighting yourself;

09:12.152 --> 09:14.352
fighting your own inner voice.

09:14.354 --> 09:16.221
"Inner voice?
You mean, like...

09:16.223 --> 09:19.357
like... like a Walkman
with stereo headphones?"

09:19.359 --> 09:22.127
I say, "No,
it's a moving meditation."

09:22.129 --> 09:23.528
"Wow, mister.

09:23.530 --> 09:26.431
T-They don't teach that
in the fifth grade."

09:26.433 --> 09:28.300
They sure don't.

09:28.302 --> 09:31.403
And he walked away,
rolling a tire.

09:31.405 --> 09:32.904
Yeah, dude,

09:32.906 --> 09:33.939
I'm not in fifth grade.

09:33.941 --> 09:35.040
I'm in high school.

09:35.042 --> 09:37.208
I've had, like,
full sex.

09:37.210 --> 09:38.843
And I-I don't call people
"mister"

09:38.845 --> 09:42.180
'cause I'm an idiot
from some black-and-white movie.

09:42.182 --> 09:44.049
So me, Robbie, and AJ
were skateboarding

09:44.051 --> 09:45.584
near the public stairs

09:45.586 --> 09:47.986
and then there's this
old lady-looking dork-ass

09:47.988 --> 09:49.754
standing there
doing slow karate.

09:49.756 --> 09:51.056
And we're like, "Move."

09:51.058 --> 09:53.592
And he's like,
"This is tai chi."

09:53.594 --> 09:56.928
And we're like,
"No one gives a shit."

09:56.930 --> 09:59.364
So he... he was eating his lunch
in this Tupperware.

09:59.366 --> 10:01.299
He said it was his special meal.

10:01.301 --> 10:05.236
And so we took it and just,
like, chucked it at this statue.

10:05.238 --> 10:06.671
So...
So that's how that went down.

10:06.673 --> 10:08.740
So Ramona and I checked
the real estate listings

10:08.742 --> 10:11.276
and there are five apartments
we want to see.

10:11.278 --> 10:12.611
The...
No.

10:12.613 --> 10:16.214
This is something else.

10:16.216 --> 10:17.782
Five apartments we want to see.

10:17.784 --> 10:19.417
One, two, three, four, five.

10:19.419 --> 10:22.253
Now, I have to meet Ramona,
but first,

10:22.255 --> 10:24.189
I want to see my analyst.

10:24.191 --> 10:26.458
You know, I d...
I don't feel centered, you know.

10:26.460 --> 10:28.326
I'm about to face these...
these new apartments

10:28.328 --> 10:30.862
and I... I can't make
any kind of rational decision

10:30.864 --> 10:34.699
with this monkey-mind thinking
in my brain, and...

10:34.701 --> 10:36.568
my analyst, you know,
he's one of these great

10:36.570 --> 10:39.170
elderly Freudian types,
you know.

10:39.172 --> 10:42.307
He has a very authoritative
manner and he says...

10:42.309 --> 10:43.441
"Parker,

10:43.443 --> 10:46.011
"moving isn't your problem

10:46.013 --> 10:47.912
"because wherever you go,

10:47.914 --> 10:52.150
your brain will follow."

10:52.152 --> 10:53.818
I'm not a psychiatrist.

10:53.820 --> 10:55.954
I work at a walk-in clinic.

10:55.956 --> 10:59.724
Parker came in for a flu shot
like nine years ago

10:59.726 --> 11:01.426
and now he shows up once a week.

11:01.428 --> 11:04.863
We normally have him lie down
and let him use the bathroom.

11:04.865 --> 11:07.732
Now, I have meet Ramona,
so I wandered down the subway

11:07.734 --> 11:10.835
and I'm descending the stairs
like I'm going into a great womb

11:10.837 --> 11:14.639
and... and I'm back in the womb
and I discover I have no tokens.

11:14.641 --> 11:15.807
I have no tokens!

11:15.809 --> 11:18.743
Because this is a womb
you pay to get into,

11:18.745 --> 11:21.212
whereas in birth,
you pay when you leave.

11:21.214 --> 11:23.581
No refunds.

11:27.421 --> 11:28.853
I say to the woman
in the booth...

11:28.855 --> 11:30.021
her name's Darlene...

11:30.023 --> 11:31.423
I...
I see a kindness in her eyes

11:31.425 --> 11:33.458
and I say,
"I don't have a token,

11:33.460 --> 11:35.360
"but I...
I need to get on the train.

11:35.362 --> 11:37.762
"I need to...
I need to escape.

11:37.764 --> 11:39.531
I need to escape my life."

11:39.533 --> 11:41.099
And she says,

11:41.101 --> 11:43.902
"I... I can't let you do that
or I'll lose my job,

11:43.904 --> 11:47.138
"but... there's a bodega
just up the stairs.

11:47.140 --> 11:48.840
"Get change.

11:48.842 --> 11:51.509
"I'll be here, Parker.

11:51.511 --> 11:52.977
You'll get where
you need to go."

11:52.979 --> 11:54.079
Hold up.

11:56.149 --> 11:57.782
Attention:

11:57.784 --> 12:00.985
This old George Washington
lookin' ass

12:00.987 --> 12:03.388
tried to jump the turnstile.

12:03.390 --> 12:06.591
I had to get out of my booth
and put down my puzzle.

12:06.593 --> 12:10.161
I had to grab him and pull him
back over the turnstile,

12:10.163 --> 12:11.596
and then he starts crying.

12:11.598 --> 12:13.531
I say, "What is wrong with you
as a person?"

12:13.533 --> 12:16.367
And he says, "I have to move
from one loft to another loft."

12:16.369 --> 12:18.636
Well, I'm like,
"God, give me strength

12:18.638 --> 12:21.473
to deal with these people,
'cause I cannot."

12:21.475 --> 12:23.775
I'm gonna just not show up
one day to this job.

12:23.777 --> 12:24.876
You think I'm lying,

12:24.878 --> 12:26.578
but one day,
I'm not gonna be there

12:26.580 --> 12:29.347
and everyone can run their own
goddamn subway.

12:29.349 --> 12:30.715
Gettin' yelled at all the time.

12:30.717 --> 12:33.918
And then I'm in a monologue?
No.

12:42.461 --> 12:44.462
So I rush out
of the subway station

12:44.464 --> 12:46.965
and I duck into a bodega
to get some change.

12:46.967 --> 12:48.433
I need to break a $5 bill,

12:48.435 --> 12:51.002
so I buy some of those big
orange circus peanuts.

12:51.004 --> 12:53.638
And just as I'm about to
free-associate about the circus,

12:53.640 --> 12:56.040
I see the bodega has
a little cat living there.

12:57.410 --> 13:00.378
And he stares into my eyes.

13:00.380 --> 13:02.714
And I stare into his eyes.

13:02.716 --> 13:05.283
And from his perch on top of
a can of Goya beans,

13:05.285 --> 13:07.185
telepathically,
he says to me,

13:07.187 --> 13:08.520
"Why are you here?"

13:08.522 --> 13:10.388
I'm here for change.

13:10.390 --> 13:14.793
And the cat says to me,
"Change comes from within."

13:35.447 --> 13:37.749
Finally,
I get to the apartment.

13:37.751 --> 13:39.751
Ramona's waiting for me outside.

13:39.753 --> 13:43.021
She's upset because she thinks
she's about to have her period

13:43.023 --> 13:46.558
and Mercury's in...
retrograde, or something.

13:46.560 --> 13:48.426
No, I had a cyst burst.

13:48.428 --> 13:50.161
I called Parker,
but he was getting beat up

13:50.163 --> 13:51.596
by some skater kids.

13:51.598 --> 13:53.264
And it's a large apartment
on Allen Street

13:53.266 --> 13:54.899
in Chinatown...

13:54.901 --> 13:56.668
a whole floor of this building,

13:56.670 --> 13:59.037
and...
the super lets us in,

13:59.039 --> 14:01.639
and he... you know,
he's one of these great African characters

14:01.641 --> 14:03.408
out of a Kipling story,
you know.

14:03.410 --> 14:04.976
And he says,

14:04.978 --> 14:06.911
"These apartments going fast.

14:06.913 --> 14:09.681
"Nothing stays open
in this city for long.

14:09.683 --> 14:11.916
"But before I show you around,

14:11.918 --> 14:13.952
here, smoke this spliff."

14:13.954 --> 14:15.687
And he hands me one of these

14:15.689 --> 14:18.923
big kahuna,
blast-you-to-the-Milky Way

14:18.925 --> 14:20.291
joints, you know.

14:20.293 --> 14:22.827
And I know I shouldn't do it.

14:22.829 --> 14:25.530
All my mental problems get
highly exacerbated by grass,

14:25.532 --> 14:27.398
but I figure...
When in Rome.

14:27.400 --> 14:28.733
Or in this case,

14:28.735 --> 14:30.902
when in Chinatown
with a Nigerian super,

14:30.904 --> 14:32.237
right?

14:32.239 --> 14:34.806
So I take a puff and zoom!

14:34.808 --> 14:36.407
I am off!

14:36.409 --> 14:37.842
I'm at warp speed, baby!

14:37.844 --> 14:40.578
Jupiter, Uranus, Pluto...
see ya, fellas!

14:40.580 --> 14:41.980
I'm in the nether regions
of space

14:41.982 --> 14:43.414
and it's like being back
in the womb again.

14:43.416 --> 14:45.049
All my Oedipal things
come back to me.

14:45.051 --> 14:47.218
I'm in the mother of space
and I see these green dots.

14:47.220 --> 14:48.286
These green dots
are coming to me.

14:48.288 --> 14:49.287
But they're not green dots.

14:49.289 --> 14:50.555
They're little aliens.

14:50.557 --> 14:52.123
And they say, "Who are you?"

14:52.125 --> 14:55.059
And I say, "I'm Parker Gail.
I do monologues."

14:55.061 --> 14:57.095
"Oh, like plays?"

14:57.097 --> 14:59.097
Not really.

14:59.099 --> 15:01.766
"Oh, so like stand-up comedy?"

15:03.168 --> 15:05.103
You know, i...
it... you...

15:05.105 --> 15:06.638
"Well, that doesn't sound
very good."

15:06.640 --> 15:07.972
And they put me
in this giant space cannon,

15:07.974 --> 15:10.875
and they shoot me back to Earth
and zoom!

15:10.877 --> 15:12.343
And voom!

15:12.345 --> 15:14.345
I'm back.

15:14.347 --> 15:16.814
Nine hours have passed.

15:16.816 --> 15:21.486
I've been curled up on the floor
the entire time.

15:21.488 --> 15:23.922
A whole open house has happened.

15:23.924 --> 15:28.593
Different couples had to
step over me on the floor.

15:28.595 --> 15:30.528
And the superintendent, he...

15:30.530 --> 15:33.197
he looked down at me
and he said,

15:33.199 --> 15:34.632
"Parker,

15:34.634 --> 15:36.634
"this is not your home.

15:36.636 --> 15:40.872
Go.
Find where you belong."

15:40.874 --> 15:41.940
Hi.

15:41.942 --> 15:43.541
I'm not African.

15:43.543 --> 15:44.943
But it's fine.

15:44.945 --> 15:48.279
I'm happy to be included
in your little show.

15:48.281 --> 15:50.882
I did show him the apartment

15:50.884 --> 15:52.817
and...

15:52.819 --> 15:55.553
there was no big kahuna joint.

15:55.555 --> 15:58.122
He went into the bathroom
and got high,

15:58.124 --> 15:59.557
then lied about it.

16:07.333 --> 16:08.833
And I wandered back
to our loft.

16:08.835 --> 16:10.568
The building next to it's
already been torn down.

16:10.570 --> 16:13.104
Signs for Stereo City
already up.

16:13.106 --> 16:16.140
And I realize I'm not mourning
the loss of the loft.

16:16.142 --> 16:19.811
I'm... I'm mourning the loss of
the first home I ever had

16:19.813 --> 16:23.548
on Runyon Road in
Foster-Glocester, Rhode Island,

16:23.550 --> 16:24.849
the home with
the wicker furniture

16:24.851 --> 16:26.551
where my parents sat us down
and said,

16:26.553 --> 16:28.686
"If there's one reason
we're splitting up,

16:28.688 --> 16:31.222
it's your brother Parker."

16:31.224 --> 16:32.490
And I enter my apartment
and I...

16:32.492 --> 16:33.758
and I not only find Ramona,

16:33.760 --> 16:35.994
but my brother and my sister,
and...

16:35.996 --> 16:38.296
and they're sitting in a circle,
and I say...

16:38.298 --> 16:40.832
I... I say,
"What is this?"

16:40.834 --> 16:42.533
And Ramona said,

16:42.535 --> 16:44.469
"Sit down, mate.

16:44.471 --> 16:47.005
What we got here
is an intervention."

16:47.007 --> 16:48.539
Dude, I'm not from
the Outback.

16:48.541 --> 16:50.608
What are these accents?

16:50.610 --> 16:51.943
Why were you even surprised?

16:51.945 --> 16:53.411
I planned an intervention
for you,

16:53.413 --> 16:54.912
like, once, maybe twice a year.

16:54.914 --> 16:56.581
I should have my own
intervention planning business.

16:56.583 --> 16:57.582
So they're all there

16:57.584 --> 16:58.616
and they tell me, "Parker,

16:58.618 --> 16:59.851
"you need to stop spinning out

16:59.853 --> 17:01.753
"into these anxiety attacks.

17:01.755 --> 17:03.488
"We want you to go 60 seconds

17:03.490 --> 17:07.458
without free-associating
yourself into a panic!"

17:07.460 --> 17:09.394
60 seconds.

17:09.396 --> 17:10.862
Okay.

17:10.864 --> 17:12.696
I can do that.

17:12.699 --> 17:14.665
But I have no concept
of 60 seconds, you see,

17:14.666 --> 17:17.602
so...
so I picture an enormous clock.

17:17.604 --> 17:19.002
And I'm...

17:19.005 --> 17:20.738
And I'm watching
the hands of the clock move

17:20.740 --> 17:23.608
and the... and the hour hand
is moving slow and steady

17:23.609 --> 17:25.843
like the tortoise,
and the minute hand is running

17:25.845 --> 17:28.346
and running and running
like the hare.

17:28.348 --> 17:29.847
But really,
when I think about it,

17:29.849 --> 17:32.016
the minute hand isn't running...
it's winding.

17:32.018 --> 17:34.619
It's winding up like Sandy
Koufax at Ebbets Field and...

17:34.621 --> 17:36.220
shit, I'm definitely
free-associating,

17:36.222 --> 17:37.922
but I don't care, baby.

17:37.924 --> 17:40.191
There's the roar of the crowd
because someone hits a home run!

17:40.193 --> 17:41.759
And it's a home run!

17:41.761 --> 17:43.795
It's a home run
and I'm running home!

17:43.797 --> 17:45.029
I'm running home!

17:45.031 --> 17:46.831
Down the road
to Foster-Glocester,

17:46.833 --> 17:48.433
and the headlights
are coming towards me.

17:48.435 --> 17:50.301
They're coming toward me.
I can't find home!

17:50.303 --> 17:53.204
I can't find home because
my home is a Stereo City!

17:53.206 --> 17:55.506
Now my former home,
it's speakers thumping,

17:55.508 --> 17:58.376
and now it's a discotheque,
and someone passes me something.

17:58.378 --> 17:59.977
I know I shouldn't smoke it,

17:59.979 --> 18:01.946
but what's bad for the brain
is good for the hips.

18:01.948 --> 18:03.681
And now I'm dancing, baby!

18:03.683 --> 18:05.249
I'm dancing, baby!

18:05.251 --> 18:07.685
And I just remembered
there's a camera on the ceiling!

18:07.687 --> 18:09.687
Hi, buddy boy!
How's it going?

18:09.689 --> 18:12.590
And I'm movin' and I'm groovin'
and I collapse of perspiration

18:12.592 --> 18:14.192
because I'm home.

18:14.194 --> 18:15.593
I'm home.

18:15.595 --> 18:18.696
I'm home.
I'm home.

18:19.498 --> 18:22.867
And I come to.

18:22.869 --> 18:25.503
And my brother is laughing.

18:25.505 --> 18:28.106
He's laughing because
only 15 seconds have passed

18:28.108 --> 18:32.443
and I free-associated so hard
that I shit my pants.

18:32.445 --> 18:34.712
And Ramona is crying.

18:34.714 --> 18:35.713
No.

18:35.715 --> 18:37.048
And I look up and I see...

18:37.050 --> 18:40.084
I see my mother and father
are there.

18:40.086 --> 18:43.488
They've come together
so long after their divorce to...

18:43.490 --> 18:45.857
to be with their son.

18:45.859 --> 18:46.991
Not true.

18:46.993 --> 18:48.392
Not true.

18:48.394 --> 18:49.861
We were never divorced,
god damn it.

18:49.863 --> 18:53.397
In my life, I never bought
wicker furniture.

18:53.399 --> 18:54.565
It creaks and...

18:54.567 --> 18:56.367
Parker,
get it through your head.

18:56.369 --> 19:00.037
We've been married 55 years

19:00.039 --> 19:01.772
and this little jerk

19:01.774 --> 19:04.342
tells people we divorced
so he can have attention.

19:04.344 --> 19:05.743
He's creative.

19:05.745 --> 19:07.778
The man's 45 years old

19:07.780 --> 19:11.282
and eats yogurt all day.

19:11.284 --> 19:12.617
And we should
get in the car now

19:12.619 --> 19:14.051
if we're gonna make it back
out of the city

19:14.053 --> 19:15.620
at a reasonable hour.

19:17.523 --> 19:20.791
My family,
my home

19:20.793 --> 19:22.693
is here, I realize.

19:22.695 --> 19:25.062
It's here.

19:25.064 --> 19:26.597
And I hug Ramona,

19:26.599 --> 19:27.999
then try to go down on her.

19:28.001 --> 19:30.735
Worst moment
of my life.

19:30.737 --> 19:33.037
And the next day,
I take Ramona by the hand...

19:33.039 --> 19:34.939
He had shit
in his pants.

19:34.941 --> 19:38.509
And we sign a lease
on that apartment in Chinatown,

19:38.511 --> 19:41.045
'cause as they say,

19:41.047 --> 19:43.114
location...

19:43.116 --> 19:45.883
is everything.

19:48.353 --> 19:50.555
And yeah.

19:50.557 --> 19:51.756
So...

19:51.758 --> 19:55.893
that's all I have to say.

19:55.895 --> 19:57.261
Okay.

19:57.263 --> 20:00.131
Mr. Gail, it says here
you have served seven years

20:00.133 --> 20:03.801
of a ten-year sentence
for burning down Stereo City.

20:03.803 --> 20:07.238
Parole is not granted
at this time.

20:08.441 --> 20:09.974
Though, could you name

20:09.976 --> 20:11.909
all the different avenues
again, please?

20:11.911 --> 20:15.112
- What?
- I'm kidding.

20:15.114 --> 20:17.615
Mr. Gail, you will be remanded
until such a time

20:17.617 --> 20:20.818
as you are eligible again
in 15 months.

20:20.820 --> 20:23.254
Okay. Can I...
Can I go to the bathroom again?

20:23.256 --> 20:25.590
No.

20:25.592 --> 20:27.091
Okay.

20:34.400 --> 20:37.400
