WEBVTT

00:17.480 --> 00:18.880
<i>Previously on Babylon Berlin.</i>

00:18.960 --> 00:21.640
-I could work at the slaughterhouse.
-No way. He should find work.

00:21.960 --> 00:23.840
Why doesn't the little one go
if I can't find work?

00:24.560 --> 00:25.640
Are you nuts?

00:25.720 --> 00:28.360
Toni goes to school.
That's why we go to work.

00:28.440 --> 00:30.200
Calm down. I'm still here.

00:30.640 --> 00:33.720
You must make sure that this train
doesn't cause any kind of publicity.

00:33.800 --> 00:35.520
My name is on the freight papers.

00:35.800 --> 00:39.120
There is phosgene in those wagons.
A banned chemical warfare agent.

00:39.400 --> 00:43.160
With this quantity you could wipe out
all life in a city the size of Berlin.

00:43.240 --> 00:45.520
You will have to answer for this.

00:45.840 --> 00:47.480
Misha, Yuri...

00:48.000 --> 00:50.000
They were all killed because of you.

00:50.760 --> 00:51.560
They are all dead!

00:52.520 --> 00:55.240
At Wormsstrasse,
there is a kind of basement.

00:55.320 --> 00:58.640
It's the headquarter of the Red Fortress.

01:00.320 --> 01:01.160
This putty is fresh.

01:03.080 --> 01:05.560
They call sheets that are stuck
in the press "print king".

01:05.680 --> 01:07.920
-AB 3-2-2-1.
-Istanbul.

01:09.400 --> 01:10.240
<i>Dearest Helga,</i>

01:10.320 --> 01:13.640
<i>my thoughts have been churning in my head,</i>
<i>but one of them has caught on.</i>

01:13.720 --> 01:15.440
<i>I can't live this secrecy anymore.</i>

01:15.680 --> 01:18.480
<i>You say, you can't simply start</i>
<i>from scratch in Berlin.</i>

01:18.560 --> 01:20.280
<i>But I can't return to Cologne, either.</i>

01:20.600 --> 01:24.760
<i>Back to a life which shirks the truth.</i>
<i>Forgive me. Gereon.</i>

01:31.280 --> 01:32.120
Get lost.

01:32.400 --> 01:34.520
-What's the matter with you?
-Get lost!

02:32.480 --> 02:34.800
Mr. Rath? It's for you.

02:35.200 --> 02:36.080
One moment. Hello?

02:40.280 --> 02:43.040
<i>Councillor Benda for you.</i>
<i>I'll put you through.</i>

02:43.840 --> 02:44.760
<i>Rath?</i>

02:44.960 --> 02:46.000
Mr. Councillor?

02:46.160 --> 02:49.080
<i>We've got Kardakov.</i>
<i>He was found yesterday.</i>

02:49.520 --> 02:51.560
<i>Together with 14 other bodies.</i> The chief of the homicide squad is there.

02:55.920 --> 02:58.000
-The Buddha?
-In person.

03:12.040 --> 03:13.000
That's him.

03:13.920 --> 03:16.400
Don't ask too many questions,
he'll approach you.

03:37.440 --> 03:40.400
May I introduce? Criminal Counsellor
Gennat, chief of Homicide...

03:40.480 --> 03:41.360
Come with me.

03:44.720 --> 03:46.400
How did you identify him?

03:46.760 --> 03:49.400
A telegram, stuck in his jacket pocket.

03:49.480 --> 03:50.880
Show us, KrÃ¼ger.

03:55.840 --> 03:57.520
-Is it in code?
-Yes.

03:57.840 --> 03:59.360
But look at the recipient. -Kardakov.
-Russian.

04:05.920 --> 04:07.120
Who speaks Russian?

04:07.640 --> 04:10.080
-I do, sir.
-Go ahead, Czerwinski.

04:10.160 --> 04:11.120
Yes, sir.

04:15.960 --> 04:18.120
So the vice squad
is looking into murders now?

04:18.480 --> 04:21.160
This case is also of importance
for the political police.

04:22.320 --> 04:25.960
Your presence is clear proof of that,
Mr. Councillor. Come along.

04:26.760 --> 04:30.280
It seems that the 13 men and two women

04:30.680 --> 04:32.880
were liquidated with machine guns.

04:36.560 --> 04:38.120
Including shots in the neck.

04:38.400 --> 04:41.280
-All of them?
-Yes. They wanted to make very sure.

04:42.360 --> 04:44.520
We found projectiles in the neck area.

04:44.880 --> 04:47.120
They look like 7.62s.

04:47.680 --> 04:49.840
A proper firing squad.

04:53.480 --> 04:54.920
Which one is Kardakov?

04:55.800 --> 04:57.680
Here, number six.

05:01.240 --> 05:02.080
See?

05:03.920 --> 05:05.080
The back of the head.

05:05.520 --> 05:07.280
One shot from close range.

05:07.360 --> 05:10.080
On top of a dozen machine gun bullets.

05:15.640 --> 05:16.480
The Red Fortress.

05:18.480 --> 05:19.440
Henning, help him.

05:28.200 --> 05:29.360
This is not Kardakov.

05:32.880 --> 05:35.800
Who could have done that?
The Soviet secret service?

05:35.880 --> 05:37.160
That would be my assumption.

05:37.840 --> 05:40.800
-Gennat, what do you think?
-Formidable evidence.

05:40.880 --> 05:42.920
Ballistics will tell us more
in a few hours.

05:44.320 --> 05:45.280
But...

05:46.800 --> 05:50.120
apart from the Russians,
only the Swedes use large-calibre weapons.

05:50.200 --> 05:51.440
For shooting elks.

05:51.520 --> 05:53.040
There are no elks in Berlin.

05:54.840 --> 05:57.280
This is sensitive, politically speaking.

05:57.600 --> 05:59.080
I don't care about politics.

05:59.560 --> 06:01.280
I'm a simple detective.

06:01.760 --> 06:04.680
I've got 15 murders here,
that's no trifling matter.

06:05.280 --> 06:08.120
What you make of my findings politically
is up to you.

06:08.800 --> 06:10.920
But we share the same goal.

06:11.160 --> 06:12.520
We want the perpetrators.

06:13.200 --> 06:14.120
So...

06:14.840 --> 06:15.920
Mr. Rath.

06:16.240 --> 06:18.960
The Councillor tells me
you're on this case?

06:20.080 --> 06:23.480
So put a squad together. Get to work.

06:35.360 --> 06:36.200
Thank you.

07:23.960 --> 07:26.200
DEPARTMENT A
HOMICIDE AND AGGRAVATED ASSAULT

07:47.800 --> 07:48.960
Fifteen bodies.

07:49.600 --> 07:52.000
Only one was missing: Alexey Kardakov.

07:52.840 --> 07:54.200
See? You know the deal.

07:54.520 --> 07:56.760
That's why I would like you
to be my assistant.

08:01.000 --> 08:02.120
So, are you in?

08:03.480 --> 08:04.800
Inspector, I'm honored, but...

08:05.200 --> 08:06.040
What?

08:06.120 --> 08:09.440
I know someone
who knows this case a lot better than me.

08:10.120 --> 08:12.160
-But I want you.
-Yes, but...

08:12.920 --> 08:15.800
-But all I know, I know from...
-If I wanted Charlotte Ritter,

08:15.880 --> 08:17.040
I would have asked her. So, can I count on you?

08:22.840 --> 08:23.680
Good.

08:26.480 --> 08:28.440
-You've been to the printer's shop.
-Yes.

08:29.320 --> 08:30.360
Anything conspicuous?

08:31.120 --> 08:32.600
Well, the 'print king.'

08:33.600 --> 08:36.360
A freight paper.
It was stuck in one of the presses.

08:36.440 --> 08:40.120
For one of the wagons of our gas train.
It was destined for Istanbul.

08:40.200 --> 08:42.240
I see. Where is it?

08:42.880 --> 08:45.880
I don't know. Maybe... Maybe she kept it.

08:46.280 --> 08:48.320
-Kept it?
-Well...

08:48.960 --> 08:52.200
It wasn't according to the books,
the way we got in.

08:54.240 --> 08:56.880
That girl doesn't know
how to spell the word "legal".

08:58.160 --> 08:59.080
PUBLIC BATH

08:59.160 --> 09:01.000
Half an hour, 25 pfennigs.

09:01.280 --> 09:03.840
-Six for a second towel.
-One is enough, thanks.

09:06.320 --> 09:07.360
Come with me.

09:17.560 --> 09:19.200
-Head or tails?
-Tails.

09:21.680 --> 09:24.040
OK, you first, and hurry up this time.

09:34.520 --> 09:35.480
Still nothing?

09:37.080 --> 09:39.000
-From the Cologne guy?
-No.

09:39.800 --> 09:41.160
I'm afraid he's written me off.

09:42.560 --> 09:43.600
And the other one?

09:44.240 --> 09:46.480
-The little one.
-Stefan?

09:47.160 --> 09:49.320
Oh, he's a gusher.

09:49.960 --> 09:51.000
And Rudi?

09:53.880 --> 09:55.800
He's not showing either, the putz.

09:56.480 --> 09:57.480
Did you do something wrong?

09:58.720 --> 09:59.600
Me?

10:00.600 --> 10:03.160
-No, why do you say that?
-Well...

10:04.440 --> 10:05.320
What?

10:05.640 --> 10:09.040
Well, sometimes you can be a bit forward.

10:09.280 --> 10:10.160
What are you...

10:11.840 --> 10:14.160
Three guys on the go,
and all of them gone?

10:14.440 --> 10:15.440
Oh, you.

10:15.680 --> 10:18.160
Just because you're freshly fried
by your Willi.

10:18.840 --> 10:20.320
His name is Fritz.

10:20.840 --> 10:23.480
-Get out now, it's my turn.
-This is unfair.

10:23.560 --> 10:25.440
-Why?
-Quarter of an hour each.

10:25.680 --> 10:27.520
No way. It's heat, length, dirt.

10:28.080 --> 10:30.440
-What's that supposed to mean?
-You had the hot water,

10:30.520 --> 10:32.160
so I get more time in your broth.

10:33.640 --> 10:35.040
Yes. Get out now.

10:59.920 --> 11:00.840
For you.

11:04.120 --> 11:05.000
Open it.

11:05.920 --> 11:07.440
-Me?
-Who else?

11:07.680 --> 11:08.680
Him or what?

11:12.320 --> 11:13.160
Dirt bag.

11:16.880 --> 11:17.760
Mother is sleeping.

11:20.880 --> 11:21.720
Go on.

11:37.720 --> 11:38.680
From him.

11:40.120 --> 11:40.960
Thank you.

11:42.400 --> 11:43.320
Try it on.

11:44.320 --> 11:46.280
Sure, so you can sneak a peek?

11:47.200 --> 11:48.480
Do you want it or not?

12:03.240 --> 12:04.080
Out with it.

12:08.880 --> 12:09.760
Good money.

12:10.440 --> 12:11.800
A bang for the buck.

12:23.560 --> 12:26.680
Excuse me. Where do I find Miss Ritter?

12:26.760 --> 12:28.000
Upstairs, under the roof.

12:30.040 --> 12:31.040
Thank you.

12:49.600 --> 12:50.440
Mother? Mum?

13:14.920 --> 13:17.120
Hello. Is this the Ritter family?

13:17.600 --> 13:19.160
Depends on what you want.

13:20.080 --> 13:21.280
I'm looking for Charlotte.

13:23.840 --> 13:26.000
Now her suitors come to the house or what?

13:29.480 --> 13:31.240
Go away. She's not here.

13:32.120 --> 13:33.480
And don't come back.

13:33.720 --> 13:35.240
Or you'll be spoiling for a fight.

13:36.320 --> 13:38.400
It's an official matter. Understand?

13:39.880 --> 13:42.800
Oh, you're police. Why didn't you say so?

13:48.560 --> 13:49.920
What do you want now?

13:50.000 --> 13:53.160
-Do you know where Lotte is?
-It's bath day today.

13:55.640 --> 13:57.920
Public baths, Gerichtsstrasse.
Around the corner.

13:58.240 --> 14:00.080
Get it or do I need to draw a map?

14:03.760 --> 14:05.120
Oh man.

14:08.280 --> 14:09.680
What's the matter with you?

14:11.040 --> 14:12.000
It looks good.

14:22.240 --> 14:23.760
What happened to your baby?

14:24.720 --> 14:25.880
I gave it away.

14:27.800 --> 14:29.600
-But it's alive?
-Yes.

14:30.160 --> 14:31.000
Where?

14:31.840 --> 14:34.320
In town somewhere, I guess.

14:35.040 --> 14:37.800
-What's its name?
-Didn't have a name yet.

14:38.560 --> 14:40.800
-Boy or girl?
-A boy.

14:41.720 --> 14:43.320
-Hajo.
-No.

14:43.920 --> 14:45.320
Why? Hajo is nice.

14:47.840 --> 14:50.640
I call him Little HÃ¤welmann. For myself.

14:51.600 --> 14:52.880
Hajo HÃ¤welmann.

14:58.280 --> 14:59.800
I don't believe this.

15:02.640 --> 15:03.480
I'll do this.

15:04.800 --> 15:07.640
Not a second to dry off.
I don't believe this.

15:09.400 --> 15:11.720
Where is the paper
you took from the printer's?

15:14.440 --> 15:16.880
First you tell me to go to hell,
now you come back and want something?

15:17.520 --> 15:18.920
I want the evidence.

15:19.400 --> 15:22.360
I tried to reach you but you had them say
you weren't at the office.

15:22.600 --> 15:24.480
Had I wanted to talk to you,
I would have done so.

15:25.000 --> 15:26.160
Give me the document.

15:27.840 --> 15:29.440
-I chucked it.
-Are you nuts?

15:29.520 --> 15:30.600
You can't chuck evidence.

15:30.680 --> 15:33.600
You promised me
I could grow into this job.

15:33.680 --> 15:35.480
That we could solve this case together.

15:36.320 --> 15:38.960
-I promised you nothing. You lied to me.
-I did not.

15:39.200 --> 15:42.000
Yes, of course.
You abused my trust and spied on me.

15:53.680 --> 15:55.440
The evidence is in a safe place.

15:56.160 --> 15:57.040
Where?

15:59.480 --> 16:02.120
I give you the correct wagon number,
you'll give me another chance.

16:04.240 --> 16:06.400
-Why should I?
-I apologize.

16:07.520 --> 16:10.240
And if you want,
I'll explain the circumstances, too.

16:14.320 --> 16:15.520
You get dressed first.

17:22.520 --> 17:23.560
Please hold this.

17:24.360 --> 17:25.200
Thanks.

17:37.560 --> 17:38.680
This is odd.

17:48.680 --> 17:49.920
But it has to be here.

17:51.760 --> 17:52.600
Right.

17:54.880 --> 17:56.560
WAYBILL

17:56.640 --> 17:59.840
Transfer papers for one wagon. AB 3-2-2-1.

18:09.840 --> 18:11.040
Pass this on.

18:15.600 --> 18:19.160
Gentlemen,
this is Inspector Rath from Cologne.

18:19.240 --> 18:20.600
-Hello.
-Hello.

18:20.680 --> 18:25.640
Mr. Rath is investigating
by personal order of Councillor Benda.

18:25.720 --> 18:26.720
Which is?

18:27.800 --> 18:32.480
The starting point is an unidentified body
which was found in the Landwehrkanal.

18:32.560 --> 18:33.400
The Russian?

18:33.920 --> 18:37.280
-Why not a special commission?
-That's what we have now.

18:37.920 --> 18:40.200
Inspector Rath has come across a lead

18:40.280 --> 18:43.200
which will probably go
far beyond the expat environment.

18:43.280 --> 18:45.520
-Meaning?
-The man was a railway worker,

18:45.600 --> 18:47.320
and he had a secret mission.

18:48.160 --> 18:49.560
He was tortured before he died.

18:49.640 --> 18:51.640
That's standard practice for them.

18:52.360 --> 18:54.960
We're assuming this is a political crime.

18:55.640 --> 18:59.480
The dead man was a member of a Russian
resistance organization, Red Fortress.

18:59.720 --> 19:01.440
Apparently, they're active in Germany too.

19:02.040 --> 19:05.480
Their aim is to overthrow Stalin
in the Soviet Union.

19:05.560 --> 19:06.720
Who wouldn't want that?

19:08.160 --> 19:12.680
The 15 bodies in the pine forest
were all members of the Red Fortress.

19:13.400 --> 19:18.360
We're still looking for the head of the
group, a man called Alexey Kardakov.

19:18.440 --> 19:22.760
What are we to do with Russian extremists?
What's the homicide squad to do with them?

19:22.880 --> 19:25.440
Inspector Rath
has found a freight document

19:25.520 --> 19:29.240
which implicates the group
in a politically charged smuggle case.

19:29.880 --> 19:33.720
The chief of police himself has ordered
the surveillance of the train

19:33.800 --> 19:36.960
on which the murdered railway worker
arrived in Berlin.

19:37.040 --> 19:38.240
Is that enough for you?

19:39.160 --> 19:41.120
Right, carry on. What else is there?

19:41.200 --> 19:43.280
-The body in the cement.
-That's right.

19:43.360 --> 19:44.480
Fresh intel, please.

19:46.000 --> 19:48.040
Construction site Ackerstrasse.

19:48.720 --> 19:51.320
-Yesterday, the foreman found...
-When exactly?

19:51.400 --> 19:55.040
At 6.45 a.m., he found a human foot
in the foundation.

19:55.880 --> 19:57.520
The cement had been cast days ago,

19:57.600 --> 20:00.920
but the block had a tear.
It was prized open last night.

20:01.000 --> 20:03.280
They found a body whose clothes,
as you can see,

20:03.720 --> 20:06.200
make an unambiguous attribution possible.

20:06.280 --> 20:08.680
-Meaning?
-A cassock.

20:09.200 --> 20:11.000
The man must have been a priest.

20:12.440 --> 20:14.000
Has he been identified?

20:15.320 --> 20:19.200
We're still trying
to get the stuff off the body.

20:19.280 --> 20:22.320
But... we found a gunshot wound.

20:26.560 --> 20:27.480
Where is the dead man?

20:27.880 --> 20:29.880
Right now on his way to the autopsy.

20:29.960 --> 20:31.840
-At Dr. Schwarz's?
-Yes, sir.

20:32.400 --> 20:34.160
I don't have to go there. I know him.

20:35.600 --> 20:36.720
It's Saint Josef.

20:39.000 --> 20:40.000
Henning?

20:40.360 --> 20:41.560
That's him.

20:43.360 --> 20:44.520
That's not good.

20:46.480 --> 20:48.080
BÃ¶hm, that's your case.

20:48.880 --> 20:49.800
Alright.

20:51.720 --> 20:53.600
Gentlemen, thank you very much.

21:06.720 --> 21:08.000
Good day.

21:08.520 --> 21:10.360
Why does vice from Cologne want from me?

21:10.440 --> 21:11.640
I'm Berlin and Homicide now.

21:12.840 --> 21:16.120
That priest, where is he?
From this morning?

21:16.200 --> 21:19.440
-In manufacture. Just finished.
-Can I see him?

21:19.720 --> 21:21.880
I was expecting Chief Inspector BÃ¶hm.

21:23.040 --> 21:24.000
It's about the ballistics.

21:24.880 --> 21:25.760
I see.

21:32.680 --> 21:37.680
Well, he doesn't look
like a clergyman exactly.

21:48.200 --> 21:49.200
How did he die?

21:50.120 --> 21:51.200
Cardiac arrest.

21:53.680 --> 21:55.400
Following deliberate foul play.

21:57.320 --> 21:58.160
There. Thank you.

23:19.720 --> 23:20.800
I'll take the bullet.

23:21.080 --> 23:23.280
For god's sake, please don't touch it.

23:24.120 --> 23:25.640
The Buddha will kill me.

23:26.640 --> 23:27.800
New rules.

23:29.080 --> 23:30.080
Absurd.

23:31.000 --> 23:34.600
But success proves Gennat right.

23:39.600 --> 23:41.440
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

24:07.880 --> 24:09.080
Wegener.

24:10.600 --> 24:11.840
Heaven sends you.

24:18.120 --> 24:19.600
This is the business report.

24:20.160 --> 24:23.440
The shareholders' meeting
was moved up to tonight, 6 p.m.

24:25.960 --> 24:27.800
But it was scheduled for next week.

24:29.080 --> 24:30.720
At the request of your mother.

24:34.480 --> 24:37.080
Don't worry, you have plenty of time
to freshen up.

24:45.840 --> 24:48.880
-Who's this Saint Josef?
-Josef Wilczek.

24:49.520 --> 24:50.680
A heavy guy.

24:51.080 --> 24:54.440
He does the dirty work for the gangland.
He's with the Armenian.

24:54.720 --> 24:57.720
A local gangland bigwig here in Berlin.

24:57.800 --> 25:00.240
You already said local.
Not anywhere else, but here.

25:00.320 --> 25:02.240
How would he know I mean Berlin?

25:02.320 --> 25:05.280
I know who the Armenian is.
I've come across him, thanks.

25:09.800 --> 25:10.640
Inspector?

25:11.200 --> 25:13.920
For the sake of form,
who does which tasks in your commission?

25:14.000 --> 25:15.960
So we can get started and...

25:18.200 --> 25:19.440
You're my assistant.

25:20.000 --> 25:23.120
Messrs. Czerwinski and Henning are
special investigators and she's the clerk.

25:24.120 --> 25:26.440
-You know Miss Ritter, I take it?
-Yes.

25:26.840 --> 25:30.360
Good. Tell me, were you able to
decipher the telegram?

25:31.120 --> 25:33.440
Good grief, I totally forgot about that.

25:33.640 --> 25:35.320
-Holy cow.
-On the double now.

25:35.400 --> 25:37.360
-Yes, yes.
-Mr. Rath?

25:39.080 --> 25:40.400
-Shall I come with you?
-Or I?

25:40.480 --> 25:42.200
-No, I'll go alone.
-Mr. Rath.

25:42.520 --> 25:45.040
-What is it?
-We didn't know... They're waiting.

25:45.600 --> 25:46.440
Who?

25:46.920 --> 25:47.880
Your relatives.

26:04.840 --> 26:05.960
Hey, Junior.

26:16.440 --> 26:17.280
Inspector.

26:28.080 --> 26:29.080
Come on in.

26:32.320 --> 26:33.920
That's quite the surprise.

26:35.360 --> 26:36.680
You wouldn't have expected that, right?

26:42.200 --> 26:44.560
-Was that your idea?
-No, Mum's.

26:48.920 --> 26:50.480
Didn't you get my letter?

26:50.760 --> 26:54.400
I did. Moritz,
will you leave me and your uncle alone?

27:02.920 --> 27:05.920
Your brother Anno
was officially declared dead.

27:07.600 --> 27:10.040
We received the official certificate.

27:10.600 --> 27:14.080
He's no longer missing,
he's finally declared killed in action.

27:19.000 --> 27:19.920
And now?

27:20.720 --> 27:22.440
We're here if you want us to be.

27:48.000 --> 27:49.120
Bruno, I need your help.

27:51.760 --> 27:52.600
Stop.

27:55.400 --> 27:58.440
This is the correct way. Madam.

28:02.240 --> 28:03.240
Thank you, Bruno.

28:05.160 --> 28:07.600
Right, off we go. See you tonight.

28:25.400 --> 28:27.960
<i>-I want the homicide squad.</i>
<i>-You want the homicide squad!</i>

28:28.960 --> 28:30.080
<i>There are no women.</i>

28:32.840 --> 28:35.280
We couldn't get the cement out.
It was too hard already.

28:36.440 --> 28:38.480
Thank you. Goodbye.

28:42.600 --> 28:44.800
DRY CLEANERS

29:48.200 --> 29:52.800
<i>Here, a little souvenir</i>
<i>of your exciting time in the capital.</i>

30:04.240 --> 30:06.600
-Yes?
-Hello.

30:06.720 --> 30:09.800
I was asked to hand this in
for Chief Inspector BÃ¶hm.

30:11.800 --> 30:12.840
Saint Josef.

30:12.920 --> 30:13.920
I heard.

30:18.400 --> 30:20.520
Let's see who offed him.

30:23.200 --> 30:24.160
One second.

30:28.240 --> 30:29.240
Sign here.

30:30.280 --> 30:31.200
Of course.

30:31.720 --> 30:35.760
CONFIRMATION OF RECEIPT/EXIT

30:41.640 --> 30:42.480
Thank you.

30:44.320 --> 30:45.680
Tomorrow we'll know more.

30:58.480 --> 31:00.120
Hey girl, where are you headed?

31:01.280 --> 31:02.280
Excuse me,

31:02.360 --> 31:04.120
I'm looking for my sister.

31:05.320 --> 31:06.560
She works here. Charlotte Ritter.

31:08.600 --> 31:09.920
Well, let's inquire.

31:14.920 --> 31:17.160
How will we pay for that?
We don't even have the three marks.

31:17.880 --> 31:20.720
They'll come and collect her.
That's the easiest way.

31:20.800 --> 31:23.840
It must be possible for us
to get her buried somehow.

31:23.920 --> 31:26.400
-It's not.
-You say that.

31:44.320 --> 31:45.360
From the public health officer.

31:45.440 --> 31:46.800
DEATH CERTIFICATE

31:46.880 --> 31:47.920
He wants three marks.

31:51.360 --> 31:52.880
Call the CharitÃ© hospital
so they come and get her.

31:56.920 --> 31:59.240
-Why?
-They'll take her for free.

32:00.360 --> 32:01.840
Do you know what they'll do with her?

32:02.360 --> 32:03.920
Doesn't matter. She's dead.

32:04.600 --> 32:05.440
And dead she is.

32:05.760 --> 32:08.400
Do you want to pay Grieneisen
and his crematory?

32:09.200 --> 32:10.280
Do you know how much he charges?

32:12.200 --> 32:13.520
Mother won't go to the CharitÃ©.

32:15.040 --> 32:15.880
I don't want that.

32:16.840 --> 32:19.520
-I don't want them to cut her up.
-Well then.

32:19.600 --> 32:22.080
-Take care of it.
-And you pay for it.

32:24.080 --> 32:24.920
I will.

32:27.080 --> 32:30.800
Your pussy will have to meow a lot
until you get the 80 marks.

32:36.480 --> 32:41.200
Ordering quantities have stabilized
for diggers and deep-freezers.

32:41.280 --> 32:44.880
We're in good hope for the extension
of the railway network in the south-west

32:44.960 --> 32:47.760
where the planned 450 kilometers...

32:48.440 --> 32:52.760
...stabilized our financial situation,
and in very difficult times, too.

32:53.120 --> 32:57.320
Some of our partner companies
and competitors in the German Reich

32:57.400 --> 33:00.000
have dropped out of our core businesses.

33:00.080 --> 33:03.040
The market, on the other hand,
has expanded.

33:03.120 --> 33:05.880
The new possibilities are stunning.

33:06.440 --> 33:08.040
To analyze them,

33:08.520 --> 33:12.160
and to cast a creatively daring and at the
same time economically conservative glance

33:12.240 --> 33:14.680
at the future of Nyssen AG

33:14.760 --> 33:18.160
is what we want to achieve
at today's shareholder meeting.

33:19.440 --> 33:25.680
To present the business report of
Nyssen AG, please extend a warm welcome

33:25.760 --> 33:27.400
to Mrs Annemarie Nyssen.

33:37.440 --> 33:38.280
Thank you.

33:42.560 --> 33:47.080
Today we need to align pleasant
and unpleasant things.

33:48.080 --> 33:50.360
Our annual accounts are pleasant.

33:50.440 --> 33:55.720
Despite all the dire prophecies,
we can be proud of our balance of '28.

33:58.800 --> 34:01.960
Unpleasant are the rumors

34:02.040 --> 34:05.000
which circulate
around our enterprise these days.

34:05.080 --> 34:08.480
Naturally, they are all unfounded.

34:09.680 --> 34:13.520
To calm the situation, we have
nevertheless taken appropriate steps

34:13.600 --> 34:18.440
and released my son Alfred
from all his duties within the board.

34:20.000 --> 34:24.280
The board of directors
thus follows Alfred's own wish.

34:24.360 --> 34:28.160
In future, he will exclusively
attend to our trust.

34:28.880 --> 34:31.560
We all wish him strength
and vision for this,

34:31.640 --> 34:33.600
and we thank him
for his energy and competence

34:33.680 --> 34:37.720
which he has brought to the company
in the past years.

34:46.320 --> 34:49.320
In our business report of last year

34:49.400 --> 34:54.760
we have hinted at the beneficial economy
of the year 1927,

34:55.240 --> 34:57.600
but we also had to point out...

34:58.600 --> 35:02.440
that this rise was mainly due
to the fact that at the time,

35:02.520 --> 35:07.080
numerous foreign loans
benefitted sales on the domestic market.

35:07.160 --> 35:11.320
This could pose a danger
for our further development.

35:27.440 --> 35:30.440
Your nipper, how old is he?

35:31.880 --> 35:32.720
Twelve.

35:34.560 --> 35:36.680
You never told me you had a son.

35:38.120 --> 35:41.280
-Moritz is not my son.
-I see.

35:41.360 --> 35:42.480
No, he's my nephew.

35:43.680 --> 35:47.120
Oh, your sister's son.
Is Helga your sister?

35:47.200 --> 35:49.480
No. She's my sister-in-law.

35:49.880 --> 35:51.760
Moritz is my brother's son.

35:54.240 --> 35:55.920
My brother's, who was killed in action.

35:56.320 --> 35:57.880
Helga is his widow.

35:59.120 --> 36:00.320
Got it now.

36:02.560 --> 36:04.360
I know all about widows.

36:11.360 --> 36:14.280
Well, has Emmi shown you everything?

36:14.600 --> 36:16.840
Yes. I can have the servant's chamber.

36:16.920 --> 36:18.800
I just have to put his bedding upstairs.

36:19.640 --> 36:20.480
Go on.

36:22.120 --> 36:24.360
It is really most kind of you, Mr. Wolter.

36:25.040 --> 36:27.920
Bruno. You'll be rid of us come Sunday.

36:28.000 --> 36:29.320
What's on Sunday?

36:29.600 --> 36:31.760
I have a speech at the Association
for Veterans and War Widows.

36:32.080 --> 36:34.400
-Here in Berlin?
-Yes, as an exception.

36:35.280 --> 36:38.160
-It's a bit narrow up there, huh?
-No, it's cosy.

36:38.760 --> 36:43.000
You've found my gloves.
Come with me, little Schmeling.

36:46.040 --> 36:46.880
Can I try them on?

36:47.600 --> 36:48.840
-Come here then.
-Thank you.

36:48.920 --> 36:52.280
Put the gloves on first.
Here. Right arm down...

36:56.840 --> 36:58.120
Everyone once in Berlin.

37:02.160 --> 37:03.640
Don't you know what that means?

37:06.720 --> 37:08.520
No more secrecy.

37:12.880 --> 37:14.840
Show me your left hook.

37:14.920 --> 37:17.000
I'm Delarge, you're Schmeling. Attack. And...

37:22.400 --> 37:23.520
Yes. Cover.

37:23.600 --> 37:25.200
Mind your cover. And...

37:36.880 --> 37:39.480
Bang! Delarge is down.

37:43.320 --> 37:44.640
Excuse me, Mr. Wolter.

37:45.200 --> 37:48.160
-Is this a G88?
-You know this stuff, huh?

37:49.840 --> 37:50.680
Yes.

37:51.200 --> 37:53.560
That's the Gun 88.

37:56.760 --> 37:57.600
Have you held one yet?

37:59.800 --> 38:03.600
Served me well.
Now in deserved retirement.

38:10.880 --> 38:12.760
And aim.

38:14.640 --> 38:18.520
-That's enough. Come.
-Bruno, Mr. Rath is staying too.

38:18.600 --> 38:19.760
If you don't mind.

38:21.440 --> 38:22.800
Make yourselves at home.

38:23.240 --> 38:25.760
-Thanks, Bruno.
-Nice to have you here.

38:41.880 --> 38:43.400
-Good night.
-Night.

38:43.640 --> 38:44.800
I'll wake you at seven.

38:49.080 --> 38:50.280
Are you hunting a murderer?

38:51.080 --> 38:54.400
Not just one. More like a whole pack.
But you know...

38:55.600 --> 38:56.560
Or... Exactly.

39:00.280 --> 39:01.240
Sleep well.

39:07.360 --> 39:08.360
Mr. Nyssen?

39:14.440 --> 39:16.960
-Mr. Nyssen.
-I don't need anything, thanks.

39:19.240 --> 39:20.520
The countess is here.

39:22.560 --> 39:23.600
Who?

39:24.520 --> 39:27.680
-Miss Sorokina.
-Don't even let her in!

39:28.800 --> 39:32.000
She's already here, in the salon.

39:35.880 --> 39:36.800
Here, now?

39:37.880 --> 39:41.080
She's been waiting for three hours.
I couldn't stop h...

39:50.720 --> 39:51.920
What else do you want?

40:33.520 --> 40:35.440
My father had this wagon built.

40:37.520 --> 40:39.320
Shortly before the revolution.

40:40.120 --> 40:43.080
And then he hid it from the Bolsheviks.

40:44.520 --> 40:45.760
For 12 years.

40:56.720 --> 41:01.760
For years I have been trying to free
my family's treasure from Stalin's claws.

41:05.120 --> 41:07.320
Your train was my last chance.

41:11.040 --> 41:11.880
So?

41:14.720 --> 41:18.520
Since the tank wagon arrived in Berlin,
no one has opened it.

41:28.320 --> 41:29.440
Have you seen the freight?

41:31.320 --> 41:33.760
The gold? Have you seen the gold?

41:34.960 --> 41:35.800
Yes.

42:01.120 --> 42:02.760
We're still closed.

42:02.840 --> 42:06.480
Right, Gloria. You're number 12 on my list
and I want to clock off early.

42:07.360 --> 42:09.360
Wilczek. Saint Josef?

42:10.840 --> 42:11.720
I know him.

42:12.200 --> 42:15.640
And? When does he do his round
at your place?

42:16.280 --> 42:17.520
I meant on which day.

42:18.080 --> 42:20.840
Only on Sundays. He's a priest, after all.

42:21.600 --> 42:24.400
-And he was here last Sunday, too?
-Yes.

42:25.560 --> 42:29.360
And who else was here?
Of us, I mean.

42:29.840 --> 42:32.880
Well, Bruno. And one I hadn't met yet.

42:33.400 --> 42:35.760
He was good-looking but didn't say much.

42:37.200 --> 42:38.360
When did they leave?

42:40.080 --> 42:42.640
Wolter stayed until we closed.

42:43.320 --> 42:44.200
And the other one?

42:45.680 --> 42:50.440
Him... I didn't see him again
after Saint Josef was here.

42:52.240 --> 42:56.480
Oops. Now I said something.

43:37.680 --> 43:39.480
<i>To ashes, to dust</i>

43:41.120 --> 43:43.040
<i>Stolen from the light</i>

43:44.920 --> 43:46.640
<i>But not yet now</i>

43:49.120 --> 43:52.080
<i>Miracles wait until the end</i>

43:59.560 --> 44:03.080
<i>To ashes, to dust</i>

44:03.160 --> 44:05.600
<i>Stolen from the light</i>

44:07.000 --> 44:09.800
<i>But not yet now</i>

44:10.560 --> 44:12.920
<i>Miracles wait</i>

44:14.320 --> 44:17.000
<i>But not yet now</i>

44:18.400 --> 44:21.640
<i>Miracles wait until the end</i>

44:33.640 --> 44:37.040
<i>It must be just a dream</i>

44:37.240 --> 44:41.720
<i>Trying to snatch the wind</i>

44:41.800 --> 44:45.800
<i>Who really knows?</i>

44:48.360 --> 44:51.360
<i>The clock on your wall</i>

44:51.760 --> 44:55.000
<i>It is filled with sand</i>

44:55.400 --> 44:58.720
<i>Put your hand in mine</i>

44:59.240 --> 45:02.320
<i>And let us be forever</i>

45:02.840 --> 45:06.080
<i>Now you make your choice</i>

45:06.680 --> 45:11.080
<i>And throw us</i>
<i>in between happiness and agony</i>

45:11.160 --> 45:15.840
<i>But I can forgive you</i>

45:17.680 --> 45:20.920
<i>You are very close to death</i>

45:21.320 --> 45:23.840
<i>But your eye still clear</i>

45:23.920 --> 45:27.520
<i>Does it recognize me? I'm ready</i>

45:27.600 --> 45:33.040
<i>To seek immortality with you</i>
