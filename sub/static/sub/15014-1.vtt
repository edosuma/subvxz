I'm going for a cup of tea.
Do you want one?

03:06.738 --> 03:10.174
<i>- Do you want a cup of tea, Withnail?
- No.</i>

03:59.454 --> 04:02.320
<i>Thirteen million
Londoners have to wake up to this.</i>

04:02.423 --> 04:05.324
<i>The murder and all-bran
and rape?</i>

04:05.426 --> 04:08.918
<i>And I'm sitting in this bloody shack,
and I can't cope with Withnail.</i>

04:09.029 --> 04:11.088
<i>I must be out of my mind.</i>

04:11.198 --> 04:14.258
<i>I must go home at once and
discuss his problems in depth.</i>

04:17.070 --> 04:19.732
I have some extremely
distressing news.

04:19.839 --> 04:22.831
<i>I don't want to hear it.
I don't want to hear anything.</i>

04:24.444 --> 04:28.039
<i>My God, it's a nightmare,
let me tell you. It's a nightmare.</i>

04:28.147 --> 04:31.139
We've just run out of wine.
What are we gonna do about it?

04:31.250 --> 04:33.740
<i>I don't know.
I don't know.</i>

04:33.852 --> 04:36.878
Oh, God!
I don't feel good.

04:36.989 --> 04:41.187
My thumbs have gone weird!

04:41.293 --> 04:44.558
I'm in the middle
of a bloody overdose.

04:44.663 --> 04:47.632
Oh, God!

04:47.733 --> 04:50.792
My heart's beating
like a fucked clock!

04:50.901 --> 04:53.335
I feel dreadful.
I feel really dreadful.

04:53.437 --> 04:55.803
So do I.
So does everybody.

04:55.906 --> 04:57.931
Look at my tongue.

04:58.042 --> 05:00.510
Gray yellow sock.

05:00.611 --> 05:03.341
Sit down, for Christ's sake.
What's the matter with you?

05:04.815 --> 05:07.476
Eat some sugar.

05:07.584 --> 05:10.951
Listen to this.
"Curse of the supermen.

05:11.054 --> 05:14.854
"'I took drugs to win medal,'
says top athleteJeff Wode.

05:14.958 --> 05:17.927
<i>- Where's the coffee?
- "In a world exclusive interview,</i>

05:18.028 --> 05:22.259
<i>"33-year-old shot putterJeff Wode,

says his wife.

05:31.707 --> 05:34.540
"'He used to pick on me.
But now he's stopped,

05:34.643 --> 05:37.942

life and in our general life. "'

05:38.046 --> 05:42.847
Jesus Christ!
This huge, thatched head...

05:42.950 --> 05:47.512
with its earlobes and cannonball
is not considered sane.

05:47.622 --> 05:49.920
"Jeff Wode is feeling better...

05:50.024 --> 05:54.551
and is now prepared to step back into
society and start tossing his orb about. "

05:54.661 --> 05:57.027
Look at him!
Look at Jeff Wode!

05:57.130 --> 06:00.065
His head must weigh
50 pounds on its own.

06:01.501 --> 06:04.095
Imagine the size of his balls.

06:05.572 --> 06:08.507
Imagine getting into a fight
with the fucker.

06:08.608 --> 06:10.542
Please, I don't feel good.

06:10.644 --> 06:14.636
That's what you'd say.
But that wouldn't wash with Jeff.

06:14.747 --> 06:18.774
No. He'd like a bit of pleading.
Adds spice to it.

06:18.884 --> 06:24.049
In fact, he'd probably tell you
what he was gonna do before he did it.

06:25.558 --> 06:27.923
"I'm gonna pull your head off. "

06:28.026 --> 06:30.688
"No, please don't pull my head off. "

06:30.795 --> 06:34.891
"I'm gonna pull your head off
because I don't like your head. "

06:39.003 --> 06:42.564
Have you got soup?
Why didn't I get any soup?

06:42.674 --> 06:44.641
Coffee.

06:44.741 --> 06:46.902
Why don't you use a cup
like any other human being?

06:47.010 --> 06:49.808
Why don't you wash up occasionally
like any other human being?

06:49.913 --> 06:53.679
How dare you!
How dare you!

06:53.784 --> 06:56.252
How dare you
call me inhumane!

06:56.353 --> 06:59.345
I didn't call you inhumane.
You merely imagined it. Calm down.

06:59.456 --> 07:02.288
Right, you fucker.
I'm gonna do the washing up.

07:02.391 --> 07:05.554
No, no, you can't.
It's impossible, I swear.

07:05.661 --> 07:08.391
I've looked into it.
Listen to me! Listen to me!

07:08.498 --> 07:11.331
There are things in there.
There's a tea bag growing.

07:11.434 --> 07:14.699
You haven't slept in 60 hours.
You're in no state to tackle it.

07:14.804 --> 07:17.271
Wait till the morning.
We'll go in together.

07:17.372 --> 07:20.000
This is the morning!
Stand aside!

07:20.108 --> 07:24.067
You don't understand! I think
there may be something living in there.

07:24.179 --> 07:26.443
I think there may be
something alive.

07:26.548 --> 07:29.312
- What do you mean? A rat?
- It's possible.

07:29.417 --> 07:32.477
Then the fucker
will rue the day.

07:34.622 --> 07:39.059
Oh, Christ Almighty!
A sinew in nicotine base.

07:39.160 --> 07:42.618
Keep back, keep back.
The entire sink's gone rotten.

07:42.730 --> 07:44.630
I don't know what's in here.

07:44.732 --> 07:48.862
I told you, you've been bitten!

07:48.969 --> 07:51.698
Burnt! Burnt!
The fucking kettle's on fire!

07:51.804 --> 07:54.272
- There's something floating up.
- Fork it!

07:54.374 --> 07:57.866
- L-I-I don't...
- You must! You must!

07:57.977 --> 08:02.073
<i>The poop will boil through the glaze. We'll
never be able to use our dinner service again.</i>

08:02.182 --> 08:04.582
Here. Get it with the pliers.

08:04.684 --> 08:07.083
<i>No, no. No, no.
Give me the gloves.</i>

08:07.186 --> 08:09.882
That's right.
Put on the gloves.

08:09.988 --> 08:12.889
Don't attempt anything
without the gloves.

08:16.261 --> 08:19.162
- Ugh.
- What is it? What have you found?

08:19.264 --> 08:21.892
Matter.

08:21.999 --> 08:24.490
Matter?
Where's it coming from?

08:24.602 --> 08:27.594
Don't look.
I'm dealing with it.

08:29.674 --> 08:32.039
I think we've been
in here too long.

08:32.143 --> 08:35.772
I feel unusual.
I think we should go outside.

08:40.850 --> 08:43.784
This is ridiculous.
Look at me.

08:43.886 --> 08:47.379
I'm 30 in a month, and I've got
a sole flapping off my shoe.

08:47.490 --> 08:50.482
It will get better.
It has to.

08:50.594 --> 08:53.529
Easy for you to say, lovey.
You've had an audition.

08:53.630 --> 08:56.097
Why can't I have an audition?

08:56.198 --> 09:00.897
It's ridiculous. I've been
to drama school. I'm good-looking.

09:01.003 --> 09:05.099
I tell you, I've a fuck sight more talent
than half the rubbish that gets on television.

09:05.207 --> 09:07.300
Why can't I get on television?

09:07.409 --> 09:09.639
I don't know.
It'll happen.

09:09.745 --> 09:12.304
Will it?
That's what you say.

09:12.413 --> 09:16.008
The only program I'm likely to get on
is the fucking news.

09:16.117 --> 09:18.585
I tell you, I can't take
much more of this.

09:18.686 --> 09:21.120
- I'm gonna crack.
- I'm in the same boat.

09:21.222 --> 09:23.122
Yeah, yeah.

09:23.224 --> 09:25.818
I feel as sick as a pike.

09:25.927 --> 09:28.053
I'm gonna have to sit down.

09:33.233 --> 09:36.327
You know what we should do?

09:36.436 --> 09:39.064
I say, you know
what we should do?

09:39.172 --> 09:42.164
How can I possibly know
what we should do?

09:42.276 --> 09:45.802
- What should we do?
- Get out of it for a while.

09:45.911 --> 09:48.675
Get into the countryside,
rejuvenate.

09:48.781 --> 09:52.808
Rejuvenate? I'm in a park,
and I'm practically dead.

09:52.918 --> 09:55.819
What good's the countryside?

09:55.921 --> 10:00.085
- What time is it?
- It's 8:00.

10:00.192 --> 10:04.594
Four hours till opening time.
God help us.

10:04.696 --> 10:07.096
Have we got any embrocation?

10:09.067 --> 10:11.535
- What for?
- To rub on us, you fool.

10:11.636 --> 10:14.730
We can cover ourselves in Deep Heat
and get up against the radiator,

10:14.839 --> 10:17.306
keep ourselves alive till 12:00.

10:19.109 --> 10:21.543
Jesus, look at that!

10:21.645 --> 10:24.443
Apart from a raw potato,
that's the only solid...

10:24.548 --> 10:27.676
to have passed my lips
in the last 60 hours.

10:27.785 --> 10:30.185
I must be ill.

10:32.456 --> 10:36.289
<i>Even a stopped clock
gives the right time twice a day.</i>

10:37.794 --> 10:41.753
<i>And for once, I'm inclined to
believe that Withnail is right.</i>

10:41.864 --> 10:46.301
<i>We are, indeed, drifting
into the arena of the unwell,</i>

10:48.137 --> 10:51.128
<i>making an enemy
of our own future.</i>

10:51.239 --> 10:54.208
<i>What we need is harmony,</i>

10:54.309 --> 10:57.403
<i>fresh air, stuff like that.</i>

10:57.512 --> 11:01.004
Wasn't much in the tube.
Nothing left for you.

11:01.116 --> 11:04.415
<i>Why don't you ask your father
for some money?</i>

11:04.519 --> 11:07.487
If we had some money,
we could go away.

11:07.588 --> 11:11.251
Why don't you ask your father?
How can it be so cold in here?

11:11.359 --> 11:13.691
Like Greenland in here.

11:15.463 --> 11:19.923
We've got to get some booze. It's
the only solution for this intense cold.

11:20.034 --> 11:24.129
Something's got to be done.
We can't go on like this!

11:24.237 --> 11:28.435
I'm a trained actor
reduced to the status of a bum!

11:28.541 --> 11:33.240
I mean, look at us! Nothing that reasonable
members of society demand as their rights!

11:33.346 --> 11:36.577
No fridges, no televisions,
no phones!

11:36.683 --> 11:39.014
Much more of this, I'm gonna
apply for Meals On Wheels.

11:39.118 --> 11:43.020
- What happened to your cigar commercial?
- That's what I want to know.

11:43.122 --> 11:46.319
What happened to my agent?
Bastard must have died.

11:46.425 --> 11:48.325
<i>September. Bad patch.</i>

11:48.427 --> 11:51.555
Rubbish. I haven't seen Gielgud
down the Labor Exchange.

11:51.663 --> 11:53.563
Why doesn't he retire?

11:53.665 --> 11:56.565
Oh, look at this little bastard!

11:56.667 --> 12:00.000
"Boy lands plum role
for top Italian director. "

12:00.104 --> 12:04.165
'Course he does. Probably
on a tenner a day, and I know what for.

12:04.275 --> 12:08.109
Two pound ten a tit,
and a fiver for his arse.

12:10.815 --> 12:13.612
- Have you been at the controls?
- What are you talking about?

12:13.717 --> 12:16.379
The thermostats!
What have you done to them?

12:16.486 --> 12:19.649
<i>- I haven't touched them.
- Then why has my head gone numb?</i>

12:19.756 --> 12:22.247
I must have some booze.

12:22.359 --> 12:25.089
I demand to have some booze!

12:27.230 --> 12:29.959
- I wouldn't drink that if I was you.
- Why not?

12:30.065 --> 12:31.965
Because I don't advise it.

12:32.067 --> 12:34.968
Even the wankers on the site wouldn't
drink that. That's worse than meths.

12:35.070 --> 12:38.039
Nonsense. This is a far
superior drink to meths.

12:38.140 --> 12:41.007
Wankers don't drink it
because they can't afford it.

12:45.380 --> 12:48.349
Have we got any more?

12:48.450 --> 12:51.180
Liar!
What's in your toolbox?

12:51.286 --> 12:53.345
No, we have nothing.
Sit down.

12:53.455 --> 12:55.855
Liar!
You've got antifreeze.

12:55.957 --> 12:58.858
You bloody fool.
You should never mix your drinks!

13:07.734 --> 13:11.636
All right, this is the plan.
We'll get in there and get wrecked.

13:11.738 --> 13:15.674
Then we'll eat a pork pie. Then we'll
drop a couple of Surmontil 50s each.

13:15.776 --> 13:19.211
Means we'll miss out Monday
but come up smiling Tuesday morning.

13:19.312 --> 13:22.713
- What's that appalling smell?
- Perfume on my boots.

13:22.815 --> 13:25.875
I had to scrub them
with essence of petunia.

13:33.125 --> 13:37.185
Two large gins, two pints of cider,
ice in the cider.

13:37.295 --> 13:39.855
If my father was loaded,
I'd ask him for some money.

13:39.965 --> 13:42.729
If your father was my
father, you wouldn't get it.

13:42.834 --> 13:45.234
- Here you are, lads.
- Chin-chin.

13:49.007 --> 13:50.906
Ugh!

13:52.443 --> 13:55.071
What about what's-his-name?

13:55.179 --> 13:58.512
- What about him?
- Why don't you give him a call?

13:58.616 --> 14:02.052
- What for?
- Ask him about his house.

14:02.152 --> 14:05.246
You want me to call what's-his-name
and ask him about his house?

14:05.356 --> 14:08.688
- Why not?
- All right. What's his number?

14:08.791 --> 14:11.453
I have no idea.
I've never met him.

14:11.561 --> 14:14.462
Well, neither have I.
Who the fuck are you talking about?

14:14.564 --> 14:16.896
Your relative with the house
in the country.

14:17.000 --> 14:19.662
- Monty? Uncle Monty?
- Same. That's the one.

14:19.769 --> 14:22.738
Get theJag fixed up,
spend a week in the country.

14:22.838 --> 14:26.638
All right. Give us a tanner,
and I'll give him a bell.

14:26.742 --> 14:31.236
Here. Get a couple more.
I'm going for a slash.

14:38.186 --> 14:40.085
Ponce.

14:43.057 --> 14:45.753
<i>I could hardly
piss straight with fear.</i>

14:45.860 --> 14:49.421
<i>A man with three-quarters of an inch
of brain had taken a dislike to me.</i>

14:49.530 --> 14:53.933
<i>What have I done to offend him? I don't
consciously offend big men like this.</i>

14:54.035 --> 14:56.935
<i>And this one has a definite
imbalance of hormone in him.</i>

14:57.037 --> 15:00.165
<i>Get any more masculine than him,
you'd have to live up a tree.</i>

15:00.273 --> 15:03.504
<i>"I fuck arses. "
Who fucks arses?</i>

15:03.610 --> 15:06.306
<i>Maybe he fucks arses.</i>

15:06.413 --> 15:09.541
<i>Maybe he's written this in some
moment of drunken sincerity?</i>

15:09.649 --> 15:12.116
<i>I'm in considerable
danger in here.</i>

15:12.217 --> 15:14.208
<i>I must get out of here at once.</i>

15:18.557 --> 15:20.718
Perfumed ponce!

15:22.595 --> 15:25.826
You'll be pleased to hear
Monty's invited us for drinks.

15:25.931 --> 15:28.126
Balls to Monty.
We're getting out.

15:28.233 --> 15:31.360
Balls to Monty? I already spent
an hour flattering the bugger.

15:31.469 --> 15:35.405
There's a man over there doesn't like
the perfume. A big one. Don't look.

15:35.506 --> 15:38.236
We're in danger.
We've got to get out.

15:38.343 --> 15:42.370
- What are you talking about?
- I've been called a ponce.

15:42.480 --> 15:45.607
What fucker said that?

15:51.154 --> 15:54.123
I called him a ponce,

15:54.224 --> 15:56.590
and now I'm calling you one.

15:56.693 --> 15:58.820
Ponce!

15:58.929 --> 16:01.260
Would you like a drink?

16:01.364 --> 16:03.389
What's your name? McFuck?

16:04.767 --> 16:08.328
I have a heart condition.
I have a heart condition.

16:08.437 --> 16:11.167
If you hit me, it's murder.

16:11.273 --> 16:13.969
I'll murder the pair of yous!

16:14.076 --> 16:16.772
My wife is having a baby.

16:16.879 --> 16:21.406
<i>Listen, I don't know what my...
acquaintance did to upset you,</i>

16:21.516 --> 16:24.041
but it's nothing to do with me.

16:24.152 --> 16:26.780
I suggest you both go outside...

16:26.888 --> 16:29.652
and discuss it sensibly
in the street.

16:32.327 --> 16:34.226
Out of my way!

16:39.967 --> 16:42.959
<i>Speed is like
a dozen transatlantic flights...</i>

16:43.070 --> 16:45.436
<i>without ever
getting off the plane.</i>

16:45.539 --> 16:49.635
<i>Time change.
You lose. You gain.</i>

16:49.743 --> 16:53.769
<i>Makes no difference, so long
as you keep taking the pills.</i>

16:53.880 --> 16:56.713
<i>But sooner or later,
you gotta get out...</i>

16:56.816 --> 16:58.943
<i>because it's crashing,</i>

16:59.052 --> 17:02.044
<i>and all at once
those frozen hours...</i>

17:02.155 --> 17:04.782
<i>melt through
the nervous system...</i>

17:04.891 --> 17:08.053
<i>and seep out the pores.</i>

17:09.361 --> 17:12.558
Bastards! Just to suck...

17:12.664 --> 17:16.122
some miserable cheap cigar,
and the bastards won't see me.

17:18.670 --> 17:20.637
Why are we having lunch in here?

17:20.739 --> 17:22.730
It's dinner, and Danny's here.

17:22.840 --> 17:24.740
Danny?
How did he get in?

17:24.842 --> 17:27.606
I let him in this morning.
He lost one of his clogs.

17:27.712 --> 17:30.340
He's come in because
of this perpetual cold.

17:30.448 --> 17:33.281
Oh, I hope
tobacco sales plummet.

17:33.384 --> 17:37.320
I've got your saveloy.
Here. I don't want it.

17:37.421 --> 17:40.184
Then stick it in a soap tray
and save it for later.

17:40.290 --> 17:42.952
Don't vent spleen on me!
I'm in the same boat!

17:43.059 --> 17:45.892
Stop saying that!
You're not in the same boat.

17:45.995 --> 17:50.432
The only thing you're in that
I have been in is this fucking bath!

17:52.702 --> 17:56.933
<i>Danny's here.
Headhunter to his friends.</i>

17:57.039 --> 18:00.941
<i>Headhunter to everybody.
He doesn't have any friends.</i>

18:01.043 --> 18:03.773
<i>The only people
he converses with...</i>

18:03.879 --> 18:06.780
<i>are his clients
and occasionally the police.</i>

18:06.882 --> 18:11.785
<i>The purveyor of rare herbs and
prescribed chemicals is back.</i>

18:11.887 --> 18:14.912
<i>Will we never be set free?</i>

18:19.560 --> 18:23.087
- Danny.
- You're looking very beautiful, man.

18:23.197 --> 18:25.097
Have you been away?

18:25.199 --> 18:29.259
St. Peter preached the epistles
to the apostles looking like that.

18:29.369 --> 18:31.701
Have you got any food?

18:31.805 --> 18:35.206
Mmm. As a matter of fact,
I got a saveloy.

18:35.308 --> 18:38.175
How much is it?

18:38.278 --> 18:40.473
You can have it for nothing.

18:40.580 --> 18:43.640
- I see you're wearing a suit.
- What's it got to do with you?

18:43.750 --> 18:47.981
<i>No need to get uptight, man.
I was merely making an observation.</i>

18:48.087 --> 18:52.615
<i>I happened to be looking for a suit
for the Coalman two weeks ago.</i>

18:52.725 --> 18:55.956
For reasons I can't really
discuss with you...

18:56.061 --> 18:58.655
the Coalman
had to go toJamaica.

18:58.764 --> 19:01.528
Got busted coming back
through Heathrow.

19:04.636 --> 19:06.536
Had a weight under his fez.

19:06.638 --> 19:10.768
<i>We worked out, it would be very handy
karma for him to get hold of a suit.</i>

19:10.875 --> 19:14.242
But he's a very low-temperature
spade, the Coalman.

19:14.345 --> 19:17.314
Goes into court
in his caftan and a bell.

19:17.415 --> 19:21.350
This doesn't go down at all well.

19:21.451 --> 19:25.012
They can handle the caftan,
but they can't handle the bell.

19:25.122 --> 19:28.683
So there's this judge sitting there
in the cape like fucking Batman...

19:28.792 --> 19:32.353
<i>- with this really rather
far-out looking hat... - Wig.</i>

19:32.462 --> 19:36.522
<i>No, man. This was more
like a long white hat.</i>

19:36.632 --> 19:39.157
So he looks at the Coalman
and says,

19:39.268 --> 19:42.863
"What's all this? This is a court,
man. This ain't fancy dress. "

19:42.972 --> 19:45.668
And the Coalman
looks at him and says,

19:45.775 --> 19:48.801
"You think you look normal,
Your Honor?"

19:48.911 --> 19:51.936
Cunt give him two years.

19:53.949 --> 19:57.009
I'm afraid I can't offer
you gentlemen anything.

19:57.118 --> 19:59.848
That's all right, Danny.
We decided to lay off for a bit.

19:59.955 --> 20:03.721
That's what I thought. Except
for personal use, I concur with you.

20:03.825 --> 20:08.227
As a matter of fact, I'm thinking
of retiring and going into business.

20:08.329 --> 20:10.820
Doing what?

20:10.931 --> 20:14.162
<i>- The toy industry.
- I thought you were in the bottle industry.</i>

20:14.268 --> 20:18.432
No, man. That's a sideline.
You can have that.

20:18.539 --> 20:21.269
Instructions are included.

20:21.375 --> 20:25.538
Yeah, my partner's got a really
good idea for making dolls.

20:25.645 --> 20:30.207
His name's Presuming Ed.
His sister give him the idea.

20:30.316 --> 20:33.012
She got a doll on Christmas
what pisses itself.

20:33.119 --> 20:36.555
- Really?
- Yeah, and you gotta change its drawers for it.

20:36.656 --> 20:39.682
It's horrible, really.
But they like that, little girls.

20:39.792 --> 20:42.692
So we're gonna make one
that shits itself as well.

20:42.794 --> 20:45.388
- Shits itself?
- He's an expert.

20:45.497 --> 20:48.261
He's building the prototype now.

20:51.036 --> 20:53.197
Why is he behaving so uptightly?

20:53.305 --> 20:57.263
Because a gang of cheeroot vendors
considered a haircut beyond my abilities.

20:57.375 --> 21:00.276
I don't advise a haircut, man.

21:00.378 --> 21:03.541
All hairdressers are
in the employment of the government.

21:03.648 --> 21:05.809
Hair are your aerials.

21:05.917 --> 21:08.385
They pick up signals
from the cosmos...

21:08.486 --> 21:11.284
and transmit them
directly into the brain.

21:11.389 --> 21:14.516
This is the reason
bald-headed men are uptight.

21:14.624 --> 21:16.956
What absolute twaddle.

21:18.395 --> 21:20.295
- Has he just been busted?
- No.

21:20.397 --> 21:22.627
Then why is he wearing
that old suit?

21:22.732 --> 21:26.793
Old suit? This suit
was cut by Hawke's of Savile Row.

21:26.903 --> 21:30.861
Just because the best tailoring you've ever seen is
above your fucking appendix doesn't mean anything!

21:30.973 --> 21:33.464
Don't get uptight with me, man.

21:33.575 --> 21:38.103
'Cause if you do, I'll have to
give you a dose of medicine.

21:38.213 --> 21:42.309
And if I spike you, you'll know
you've been spoken to.

21:42.418 --> 21:45.148
You wouldn't spike me.
You're too mean.

21:45.254 --> 21:48.154
Besides, there's nothing
invented I couldn't take.

21:48.256 --> 21:53.091
If I medicined you, you'd think
a brain tumor was a birthday present.

21:54.929 --> 21:58.023
I could take double
anything you could.

21:59.934 --> 22:03.334
Very, very foolish words, man.

22:03.437 --> 22:05.837
He's right, Withnail.
Look at him.

22:05.939 --> 22:08.840
His mechanism's gone. He's had
more drugs than you've had hot dinners.

22:08.942 --> 22:11.376
I'm not having this
shag sack insulting me.

22:11.478 --> 22:13.673
Let him get his drugs out.

22:13.780 --> 22:17.648
This doll
is extremely dangerous.

22:19.485 --> 22:23.421
It has voodoo qualities.

22:32.465 --> 22:38.130
Trade,
"Phenodihydrochrolide benzorex. "

22:38.236 --> 22:41.535
Street, "the embalmer. "

22:41.639 --> 22:43.869
Balls! I'll swallow it
and run a mile.

22:43.975 --> 22:48.674
Cool your boots, man.
This pill's valued at two quid.

22:48.780 --> 22:51.680
- Two quid? You're out of your mind.
- That's sense, Withnail.

22:51.782 --> 22:55.309
You can stuff it up your arse for nothing
and fuck off while you're doing it!

22:57.821 --> 23:02.315
<i>No need to insult me, man.
I was leaving anyway.</i>

23:05.662 --> 23:08.824
Have either of you got shoes?

23:34.356 --> 23:36.824
Monty's car.

23:45.366 --> 23:48.358
Oh, hello! Come in.

23:56.444 --> 24:00.140
Sit down, do.
Would you like a drink?

24:00.246 --> 24:02.339
- Sherry.
- Sherry.

24:05.452 --> 24:07.352
- Sherry?
- Sherry.

24:07.454 --> 24:09.354
Sherry.

24:13.392 --> 24:15.952
Do you like vegetables?

24:16.061 --> 24:18.791
I've always been fond
of root crops,

24:18.897 --> 24:21.422
but I only started
to grow last summer.

24:21.533 --> 24:25.128
I happen to think the cauliflower
more beautiful than the rose.

24:25.237 --> 24:27.137
Chin-chin.

24:27.239 --> 24:29.638
- Do you grow?
- Geraniums.

24:29.740 --> 24:31.833
Little traitors.

24:31.943 --> 24:35.174
I think the carrot infinitely
more fascinating than the geranium.

24:35.279 --> 24:38.737
Mmm. The carrot has mystery.

24:38.850 --> 24:41.876
Flowers are essentially tarts,

24:41.986 --> 24:45.012
prostitutes for the bees.

24:46.423 --> 24:49.483
<i>There is, you will agree,
a certain "je ne sai quoi,"</i>

24:49.593 --> 24:53.256
something very special
about a firm, young carrot.

24:53.363 --> 24:55.490
Hmm, excuse me.

24:55.599 --> 24:59.160
Do help yourselves to another drink.

24:59.269 --> 25:01.737
What's all this?
The man's mad.

25:01.838 --> 25:04.397
- Eccentric.
- Eccentric? He's insane!

25:04.507 --> 25:07.101
Not only that,
he's a raving homosexual.

25:09.211 --> 25:11.475
<i>You beastly little parasite!
How dare you?</i>

25:11.580 --> 25:14.344
You little thug!
How dare you!

25:16.986 --> 25:19.545
Beastly, ungrateful little swine!

25:19.654 --> 25:23.385
- Shall I get you a drink?
- Yes, yes, yes, please, dear boy.

25:23.491 --> 25:26.051
You can prepare me a small
rhesus-negative Bloody Mary.

25:26.161 --> 25:30.291
You must tell me all the news. I haven't
seen you since you finished your last show.

25:30.398 --> 25:33.196
Rather busy, Uncle.
TV and stuff.

25:33.301 --> 25:36.599
My agent's attempting to edge me
towards Royal Shakespeare Company again.

25:36.703 --> 25:40.605
<i>- Oh, splendid.
- And he's just had an audition for rep.</i>

25:40.707 --> 25:43.870
Oh, splendid!
So you're a Thespian too?

25:47.314 --> 25:49.305
Monty used to act.

25:49.416 --> 25:51.316
One hardly says that.

25:51.418 --> 25:54.978
I cracked the boards in my youth,
but I never really had it in my blood.

25:55.087 --> 25:57.647
And that's what's
so essential, isn't it?

25:57.757 --> 26:00.191
The theatrical zeal in the veins.

26:00.293 --> 26:04.354
Alas, I have little more
than vintage wine and memories.

26:08.667 --> 26:12.398
It is the most shattering experience
of a young man's life...

26:12.504 --> 26:16.406
when one morning he awakes
and quite reasonably says to himself,

26:16.508 --> 26:21.969
"I will never play the Dane. "

26:22.080 --> 26:25.242
When that moment comes,

26:25.349 --> 26:28.807
one's ambition ceases.

26:31.188 --> 26:33.679
Don't you agree?

26:33.791 --> 26:37.591
- It's a part I intend to play, Uncle.
- And you'll be marvelous.

26:37.695 --> 26:39.993
Marvelous.

26:41.397 --> 26:43.957
"It's gone.

26:44.067 --> 26:47.264
<i>"We do it wrong,
being so ma'jestical...</i>

26:47.370 --> 26:50.100
to offer it
the show of violence. "

26:50.206 --> 26:53.300
Let's go. He's a madman.

26:53.409 --> 26:56.173
Any minute now, he's gonna rush out
and get into his tights.

26:56.279 --> 27:00.112
- Okay, okay. Any minute.
- The house or out.

27:02.050 --> 27:04.245
Could I have a word
with you, Monty?

27:04.353 --> 27:07.288
Oh, forgive me, dear boy.
Forgive me.

27:07.389 --> 27:10.449
<i>I was allowing memory
to have the better of me.</i>

27:10.559 --> 27:13.460
<i>Shall I get you a topper?</i>

27:22.403 --> 27:25.964
Indeed, I remember my first agent.

27:26.073 --> 27:28.200
Raymond Duck.

27:30.043 --> 27:33.035
He was a dreadful little Israelite.

27:33.146 --> 27:36.115
Four floors up
on the Charing Cross Road,

27:36.216 --> 27:39.014
and never a job
at the top of them.

27:40.854 --> 27:43.652
I'm told you're a writer too.

27:45.592 --> 27:48.082
<i>Do you write poems?</i>

27:48.193 --> 27:52.152
No. I wish I could.
It's just thoughts, really.

27:53.866 --> 27:56.334
- Are you published?
- Oh, no.

27:56.435 --> 27:58.665
Where did you school?

27:58.771 --> 28:01.399
He went to the other place, Monty.

28:01.507 --> 28:04.737
Oh, you went to Eton?

28:04.842 --> 28:07.538
Get that damned little
swine out of here!

28:09.647 --> 28:13.447
It's trying to get itself in with you.
It's trying for even more advantage.

28:13.551 --> 28:15.712
It's obsessed with its gut.
It's like a bloody rugby ball now.

28:15.820 --> 28:19.118
- It will die! It will die!
- Monty. Monty.

28:19.222 --> 28:22.020
No, no, dear boy.
You must leave.

28:22.125 --> 28:24.491
Yet again, that oaf
has destroyed my day.

28:24.594 --> 28:27.620
Listen, Monty. Could I just have
a quick word with you? In private?

28:27.731 --> 28:29.892
Oh... very well.

28:41.377 --> 28:44.369
- Good night, my dears.
- Good night, Monty.

28:44.480 --> 28:47.938
What's all this going off in private
business? Why did you tell him I went to Eton?

28:48.050 --> 28:50.883
Because it wouldn't
have helped if I hadn't.

28:50.986 --> 28:54.216
I'm just trying to establish you
in some sort of context he'd understand.

28:54.322 --> 28:58.019
- What do you mean by that?
- I mean, free to those who can afford it.

28:58.126 --> 29:00.890
Very expensive
to those that can't.

29:08.602 --> 29:12.197
<i>"All Along the Watchtower"]</i>

29:45.137 --> 29:49.301
- Scrubbers!
- Up yours, Granddad!

29:49.408 --> 29:52.935
- Scrubbers! Scrubbers!
- Shut up!

29:53.044 --> 29:56.241
Little tarts.
They love it.

29:56.348 --> 29:59.339
I'm trying to drive this thing
as quietly as possible.

29:59.450 --> 30:03.216
If you don't shut up,
we'll get stopped by the police.

30:03.320 --> 30:06.483
<i>- Give me the bottle.
- Look at that. Look at that.</i>

30:06.590 --> 30:09.821
"Accident black spot. "
These aren't accidents!

30:09.927 --> 30:13.419
They're throwing themselves
into the road! Gladly!

30:13.531 --> 30:17.728
Throwing themselves into the road
to escape all this hideousness!

30:17.834 --> 30:20.701
<i>Throw yourself
into the road, darling!</i>

30:20.804 --> 30:23.364
You haven't got a chance!

31:00.475 --> 31:04.103
At some point or another,
I want to stop and get hold of a child.

31:04.211 --> 31:06.111
What do you want a child for?

31:06.213 --> 31:08.340
To tutor it in the ways
of righteousness...

31:08.448 --> 31:10.746
and procure some
uncontaminated urine.

31:10.851 --> 31:15.185
This is a device enabling the drunken
driver to operate in absolute safety.

31:15.288 --> 31:20.190
You fill this with piss,
take this pipe down the trouser...

31:20.292 --> 31:24.456
and cellotape this valve
to the end of the old chap.

31:24.563 --> 31:28.431
Then you get horribly drunk,
and they can't fucking touch you.

31:28.534 --> 31:31.526
According
to these instructions,

31:31.637 --> 31:34.697
you refuse everything
but a urine sample.

31:34.807 --> 31:37.536
You undo your valve...

31:37.642 --> 31:41.237
and give 'em a dose
of unadulterated child's piss,

31:41.346 --> 31:44.372
and they have to give you
your keys back.

31:44.482 --> 31:48.578
Danny's a genius.
I'm gonna have a doze.

33:10.096 --> 33:12.690
- Are we there?
- No, we're not. We're here.

33:12.799 --> 33:16.131
We're in the middle
of a fucking gale.

33:16.234 --> 33:18.794
You'll have to keep
a look out your side.

33:18.904 --> 33:21.737
If you see anything, tell me.
Get hold of that map.

33:21.840 --> 33:24.570
- Where's the whiskey?
- What for?

33:24.676 --> 33:27.236
I got a bastard
behind the eyes.

33:27.346 --> 33:30.144
I can't take aspirins
without a drink.

33:30.248 --> 33:33.148
- Where's the aspirins?
- Probably in the bathroom.

33:33.250 --> 33:36.947
We've come out here in the middle
of nowhere without aspirins?

33:37.054 --> 33:40.319
- Where are we?
- How should I know where we are?

33:40.424 --> 33:43.825
I feel like a pig
shat in my head.

33:43.928 --> 33:47.488
Get hold of that map and look
for a place called Crow Crag.

34:04.613 --> 34:08.447
There must and shall be aspirin.

34:09.752 --> 34:12.812
Give me the keys.
Get out of the way.

34:12.920 --> 34:16.618
If I don't get aspirin,
I shall die...

34:16.725 --> 34:20.626
here on this
fucking mountainside!

34:35.976 --> 34:38.274
Christ Almighty!

35:12.877 --> 35:15.107
<i>Monty.</i>

35:32.029 --> 35:36.898
- What are you doing?
- Sitting down to enjoy my holiday.

35:39.737 --> 35:43.035
Right. Now, we're gonna have to
approach this scientifically.

35:43.139 --> 35:45.937
First thing we've got to do
is get this fire alight.

35:46.042 --> 35:48.272
Then we split into two
fact-finding groups.

35:48.377 --> 35:50.811
I'll deal with the water
and other plumbing.

35:50.913 --> 35:53.575
You can check the fuel
and wood situation.

35:57.720 --> 36:00.620
- What's that?
- The fuel and wood situation.

36:00.722 --> 36:03.714
There's nothing out there
except a hurricane.

36:07.729 --> 36:10.857
- This place is uninhabitable.
- Give it a chance. It's got to warm up.

36:10.966 --> 36:14.060
Warm up? We may as well
sit around a cigarette.

36:14.169 --> 36:16.728
This is ridiculous.

36:16.837 --> 36:20.170
We'll be found dead
in here next spring.

36:21.408 --> 36:24.172
I've got a blinding
fucking headache.

36:24.278 --> 36:26.838
We must have heat.

36:30.084 --> 36:32.313
<i>We've got to keep
this bastard burning.</i>

36:32.418 --> 36:35.080
Well, we've got enough
furniture for tonight.

36:35.188 --> 36:38.089
Tomorrow we'll go down
that farm and get some logs.

36:38.191 --> 36:42.389
Mistake, I'm telling you.
This was a dreadful mistake.

38:53.418 --> 38:55.978
<i>- Who's there?
- Me.</i>

38:59.423 --> 39:01.323
What do you want?

39:01.425 --> 39:04.656
I'm a friend of Montague Withnail's.
He's lent us his cottage.

39:04.762 --> 39:09.222
I wondered if you could
sell us some food... eggs and things.

39:09.333 --> 39:11.893
Hmm?

39:14.038 --> 39:17.564
What about wood and coal?

39:17.674 --> 39:20.643
I'm not from London, you know.

39:20.743 --> 39:24.008
I don't care
where you come from!

39:24.113 --> 39:26.980
<i>Not the attitude
I'd been given to expect...</i>

39:27.083 --> 39:29.313
<i>from the H.E. Bates novel
I'd read.</i>

39:29.419 --> 39:34.151
<i>I thought they'd all be out the back,
drinking cider, discussing butter.</i>

39:34.256 --> 39:36.156
<i>Clearly a myth.</i>

39:36.258 --> 39:40.354
<i>Evidently, country people are no more
receptive to strangers than city dwellers.</i>

39:43.432 --> 39:47.334
Do you think you could tell me
where I could buy some coal and wood?

39:47.436 --> 39:50.563
<i>You'll have to see me son.
He runs this farm.</i>

39:50.671 --> 39:53.663
<i>- Where is your son?
- Up in top fields.</i>

39:53.774 --> 39:57.870
<i>You can't miss him.
His leg's bound in polythene.</i>

40:22.334 --> 40:25.735
Wake up, you bastard!
Wake up!

40:27.373 --> 40:30.706
Wake up, you bastard!
You gotta get wood.

40:32.644 --> 40:34.874
Jesus! You're covered in shit.

40:34.980 --> 40:36.880
I tried to get the fuel and wood.

40:36.982 --> 40:39.882
There's a miserable
little pensioner down there.

40:39.984 --> 40:42.714
- She wouldn't give it to me.
- Where are we gonna get it, then?

40:42.820 --> 40:45.118
There's a man on the mountain.

40:45.223 --> 40:48.750
Why he's up there fuck knows.

40:48.860 --> 40:51.590
But he's up there
with a leg in polythene.

40:51.696 --> 40:54.095
You can't miss him.
He's your man.

40:54.197 --> 40:56.893
And have another look
in that shed. Find anything.

40:57.000 --> 40:59.901
If you can't find anything,
bring in the shed.

41:04.341 --> 41:07.469
How come Monty owns
such a horrible little shack?

41:07.577 --> 41:09.511
No idea.

41:09.613 --> 41:12.172
You never discuss
your family, do you?

41:12.281 --> 41:15.079
I fail to see my family
as of any interest to you.

41:15.184 --> 41:17.744
I have absolutely
no interest in yours.

41:17.853 --> 41:21.482
I dislike relatives in general,
my own in particular.

41:21.590 --> 41:24.923
- Why?
- Because... I've told you why.

41:25.027 --> 41:28.985
We're incompatible.
They don't like me being on stage.

41:29.097 --> 41:31.759
<i>Then they must be delighted
with your career.</i>

41:31.866 --> 41:34.528
- What do you mean?
- You rarely are.

41:34.636 --> 41:36.831
You just wait!
Just you wait!

41:36.938 --> 41:39.998
When I strike, they
won't know what hit them.

41:40.108 --> 41:42.303
Tractor approaching.

41:42.410 --> 41:45.378
Now get after him.
That's the man.

41:47.848 --> 41:51.113
- Hey, stop!
- Stop!

41:51.218 --> 41:53.186
Stop! Please!

41:53.287 --> 41:55.983
Stop, please!
Please stop!

41:59.158 --> 42:01.854
Please stop!

42:01.961 --> 42:04.862
<i>- Are you the farmer?
- Shut up! I'll deal with this!</i>

42:04.964 --> 42:07.057
We've gone on holiday
by mistake.

42:07.166 --> 42:09.532
We're in this cottage here.
Are you the farmer?

42:09.635 --> 42:12.695
Stop saying that, Withnail!
Of course he's the fucking farmer!

42:12.805 --> 42:15.932
We're friends
of Montague Withnail.

42:16.041 --> 42:18.635
We desperately need
fuel and wood.

42:18.743 --> 42:22.042
Montague Withnail.
You must know him!

42:22.147 --> 42:24.308
Fat man, owns the cottage.

42:24.416 --> 42:27.317
I seen a fat man.
London type. Queer sort.

42:27.419 --> 42:29.649
Think his name's French, or summit.

42:29.754 --> 42:32.381
<i>- French?
- Aye. Adriene De La Touche.</i>

42:32.490 --> 42:35.050
He ain't been here
for a couple of years.

42:35.159 --> 42:38.458
- Last time I saw him he was with his son.
- Yeah, that's him.

42:38.562 --> 42:42.760
Listen, we're bona fide. We're not from
London. Could we have some fuel and wood?

42:42.867 --> 42:46.234
I could bring you some logs up later.
I've got the cows to feed first.

42:46.337 --> 42:48.770
- When?
- Shut up! That would be very kind.

42:48.872 --> 42:52.035
What about food? Do you think
you could sell us something to eat?

42:52.142 --> 42:55.111
I could bring you a chicken,
but you'll have to go to the village.

42:55.211 --> 42:57.270
- That would be very kind, Mr...
- Parkin.

42:57.380 --> 43:00.281
Mr. Parkin.
What happened to your leg?

43:00.383 --> 43:03.716
Got a randy bull up there.
Give me one in the knee.

43:17.332 --> 43:20.199
You wanna go out back?
Get some spuds up?

43:20.302 --> 43:24.032
Sorry, I can't.
My boots are in the oven.

43:24.138 --> 43:26.868
- You'd go if you had boots?

43:26.974 --> 43:28.965
<i>Gladly.</i>

43:54.233 --> 43:56.724
- I've got one!

44:22.393 --> 44:25.624
- Great. How much do we owe you?
- Pay us when you come down.

44:25.730 --> 44:27.993
- What about this chicken?
- He's on the back.

44:38.575 --> 44:41.510
With. With.

44:41.612 --> 44:44.705
Parkin's been.
There's our supper.

44:44.814 --> 44:47.612
- What are we supposed to do with that?
- Eat it.

44:47.717 --> 44:49.651
Eat it?
The fucker's alive.

44:49.752 --> 44:51.652
- Yeah, I know that. You've gotta kill it.
- Me?

44:51.754 --> 44:55.781
- I'm fire lighter and fuel collector.
- Yeah, I know that, but I got the logs in.

45:00.295 --> 45:02.991
It takes away your appetite
looking at it.

45:03.098 --> 45:05.589
No, it doesn't.
I'm starving.

45:05.700 --> 45:08.828
- How can we make it die?
- You have to throttle them.

45:08.937 --> 45:13.567
I think you should strangle it instantly,
in case it starts to make friends with us.

45:13.675 --> 45:17.440
All right, get hold of it.
You hold it down. I'll strangle it.

45:17.544 --> 45:21.605
I can't. Those dreadful, beady eyes.
They stare you out.

45:21.715 --> 45:25.583
It's a bloody chicken! Just think
of it with bacon across its back.

45:25.686 --> 45:28.211
All right,
I'll deal with this.

45:28.322 --> 45:30.882
You'll have to get
its guts out.

45:38.264 --> 45:41.392
Never point guns at people!
It's extremely dangerous.

45:41.501 --> 45:44.334
What about this roasting dish?
What are we gonna cook it in?

45:44.437 --> 45:48.168
You're the food and plumbings man. I have
no idea. I wish I'd found this an hour ago.

45:48.274 --> 45:51.037
I'd have taken great pleasure
in gunning this pullet down.

45:54.479 --> 45:57.505
- Shouldn't it be more bald than that?
- No, it shouldn't.

45:57.616 --> 46:02.212
Right. We're gonna
have to reverse the roles.

46:02.321 --> 46:06.518
We can bake the potatoes
in the oven...

46:06.624 --> 46:09.320
and we can boil
this bastard over the fire.

46:09.427 --> 46:12.191
- Let's get its feet off.
- No.

46:12.296 --> 46:14.787
It's gonna need its feet.

46:29.979 --> 46:32.709
It can stand with its legs
on either side of that.

46:40.189 --> 46:43.454
I've already put
two shilling pieces in.

46:43.559 --> 46:46.323
No, I haven't got another.

46:46.428 --> 46:49.727
It's not my fault
if the system doesn't work.

46:52.134 --> 46:54.499
The bitch hung up on me.

47:08.883 --> 47:11.851
<i>Hello? How are you?</i>

47:11.952 --> 47:14.614
Very well.

47:14.721 --> 47:19.090
A what? Why
wouldn't they see me?

47:19.192 --> 47:21.558
This is ridiculous.

47:21.661 --> 47:24.357
I haven't been up for a job
in three months!

47:24.464 --> 47:27.955
Understudy Constantine?
I'm not going to understudy Constantine.

47:28.067 --> 47:30.297
Why can't I play the part?

47:30.403 --> 47:32.633
This is ridiculous.

47:32.738 --> 47:35.605
No, I'm not in London.
Penrith.

47:35.708 --> 47:37.835
Penrith!

47:37.943 --> 47:39.968
Well, what about TV?

47:41.213 --> 47:43.976
Listen, I pay you
ten percent to do that.

47:44.082 --> 47:47.643
<i>Well, lick ten percent
of the asses for me, then!</i>

47:47.752 --> 47:50.482
<i>Hello? Hello? Hello?</i>

47:50.588 --> 47:55.150
Hello? How dare you?
Fuck you!

47:57.662 --> 48:02.462
<i>The bastard asked me to understudy
Constantine in The Seagull.</i>

48:04.802 --> 48:08.932
I don't want to understudy anybody,
especially that little pimp.

48:10.441 --> 48:13.035
Anyway, I loathe
those Russian plays.

48:13.143 --> 48:16.044
Always full of women
staring out of windows,

48:16.146 --> 48:18.204
whining about ducks
going to Moscow.

48:28.925 --> 48:31.553
What do you think
of Desmond Wolfe?

48:31.661 --> 48:34.788
- In respect of what?
- I'm thinking of changing my name.

48:34.896 --> 48:38.059
It's too like Donald Wolfit.

48:38.166 --> 48:40.191
Changeover point.

48:44.806 --> 48:47.366
- Think he's happier than us?
- No.

48:52.546 --> 48:54.673
I suppose happiness
is relative.

48:54.782 --> 48:57.512
I never thought it would be
a polythene bag without a hole in it.

48:57.618 --> 49:00.746
- Hey!
- What's the matter with him?

49:00.855 --> 49:04.188
- Shut the gate!
- You didn't shut the gate!

49:04.291 --> 49:06.281
<i>Stop that bull!</i>

49:08.127 --> 49:10.425
<i>Stop that bull!</i>

49:13.733 --> 49:16.793
Grab its ring!
Keep your bag up!

49:16.903 --> 49:19.269
<i>Out-mind him.</i>

49:19.372 --> 49:22.397
Hey, show no fear.
Just run at it.

49:22.508 --> 49:24.840
That can't be sensible, can it?
The bastard's about to run at me!

49:24.943 --> 49:27.241
- Well, he's randy!
- Yes, I know he is!

49:27.346 --> 49:29.644
Wants to get down there
and have sex with those cows.

49:29.748 --> 49:31.875
Shut up!

49:31.984 --> 49:36.080
- Run at it, shouting!
- Do as he says, start shouting.

49:38.489 --> 49:42.152
- He won't gore you.
- A coward you are, Withnail!

49:42.260 --> 49:45.491
An expert on bulls
you are not!

49:57.941 --> 49:59.841
Shut that gate
and keep it shut!

50:02.746 --> 50:05.647
I think an evening at the Crow.

50:08.418 --> 50:12.251
<i>If the Crow and Crown
ever had life, it was dead now.</i>

50:12.354 --> 50:14.879
<i>It was like
walking into a lung,</i>

50:14.990 --> 50:19.222
<i>a sulfer-stained, nicotine
yellow and fly-blown lung.</i>

50:19.328 --> 50:23.458
<i>Its landlord was a retired alcoholic
with military pretensions...</i>

50:23.566 --> 50:25.932
<i>and a complexion
like the inside of a teapot.</i>

50:26.936 --> 50:30.200
<i>By the time the doors opened,
he was arse-holed on rum...</i>

50:30.305 --> 50:32.432
<i>and got progressively
more arse-holed...</i>

50:32.540 --> 50:35.805
<i>till he could take no more</i>

50:38.746 --> 50:41.442
We'll have another pair
of large scotches.

50:59.099 --> 51:02.033
Thought I was going
for a minute.

51:02.134 --> 51:04.125
No man's put me down yet.

51:04.236 --> 51:06.329
Have you had any training
in the martial arts?

51:06.439 --> 51:08.839
Yes, as a matter of fact,
I have.

51:08.941 --> 51:11.808
Before I became a journalist,
I was in the Territorials.

51:11.911 --> 51:14.709
You know,
when you first came in,

51:14.814 --> 51:17.782
I knew you were a services man.

51:17.882 --> 51:21.340
You could never, never disguise it.

51:23.955 --> 51:27.186
- What were you in?
- Tanks.

51:27.292 --> 51:30.557
Africa Corps.
Little before your time.

51:30.662 --> 51:33.391
I don't suppose you've
engaged, have you?

51:33.497 --> 51:37.661
- Ireland.
- Ooh, crack at the Mick?

51:37.768 --> 51:40.703
We'll have another pair
of large scotches.

51:40.804 --> 51:43.364
These shall be my pleasure.

51:48.746 --> 51:50.713
What are you doing
up here, then?

51:50.813 --> 51:52.781
<i>We're doing
a feature for Country Life.</i>

51:52.882 --> 51:54.782
Survey of rural types.

51:54.884 --> 51:59.218
You know, farmers,
traveling tinkers,

51:59.322 --> 52:01.688
milkmen, that sort of thing.

52:01.791 --> 52:03.691
Have you...

52:06.194 --> 52:08.321
Have you metJake?

52:08.430 --> 52:10.990
Poacher.
Works the lake.

52:11.099 --> 52:14.626
But, uh, keep it
under your hat, hmm?

52:25.479 --> 52:27.572
What's all this army bollocks?

52:27.682 --> 52:30.310
We got a drink, didn't we?

52:33.054 --> 52:35.614
Time, gentlemen.

52:37.958 --> 52:39.948
I think he means it.

53:11.023 --> 53:14.116
- Go ask him if we can have one.
- What for?

53:14.225 --> 53:17.854
So we can eat it.
We're fed up with stew!

53:24.202 --> 53:27.194
Excuse me.
Could we have an eel?

53:27.305 --> 53:30.899
- You've got eels down your leg.
- You leave them alone.

53:31.007 --> 53:34.841
Nothing down there
of interest to you.

53:34.945 --> 53:37.709
Help us out, Raymond.

53:37.814 --> 53:41.978
These be fed
from asshole to beak.

53:43.820 --> 53:47.846
How about one of those pheasants?
Go on, ask him.

53:49.625 --> 53:53.391
Excuse me. We were wondering if we
could purchase a pheasant off of you?

53:53.496 --> 53:55.828
No. I've got nothing to sell.

53:55.931 --> 53:58.900
Come on, old boy.
What's in your hump?

53:59.001 --> 54:03.903
Now look, you. Them pheasants are
for his pot. These here are for my pot.

54:04.005 --> 54:06.940
<i>Now what makes you think I should
give you something for your pot?</i>

54:07.041 --> 54:09.805
- What pot?
- Our cooking pot.

54:09.911 --> 54:13.608
He knows. Hey, give us
a wheeze on that fag.

54:17.417 --> 54:20.853
I might come and see you lads in a week.
I might fetch you up a rabbit.

54:20.954 --> 54:23.718
We don't want a rabbit.
We want a pheasant.

54:23.824 --> 54:26.850
<i>Listen, you young prat.
I ain't got no pheasants.</i>

54:26.960 --> 54:29.485
I ain't got no birds,
no more than you have.

54:29.596 --> 54:32.724
Of course you have.
You're the poacher.

54:32.833 --> 54:35.824
If I hear more words
out of you,

54:35.935 --> 54:39.166
I'll put one of these here
black pods on you.

54:39.272 --> 54:42.332
- Don't threaten me with a dead fish.
- Half dead, he may be.

54:42.441 --> 54:46.104
But I'll come up after you,
and I'll wake you up with a live one.

54:46.212 --> 54:50.170
Sod your pheasants!
You'll have to find us first.

54:50.282 --> 54:53.115
<i>I know where you are,
at Crow Crag.</i>

54:53.218 --> 54:55.311
<i>I've been watching you.</i>

54:55.420 --> 54:58.184
Especially you,
prancing like a tit.

54:59.958 --> 55:02.756
You want working on, boy.

55:02.861 --> 55:06.660
If I see that silage heap
hanging about up here,

55:06.764 --> 55:09.995
I'll take the bastard
axe to him!

55:10.100 --> 55:14.002
Bastards!
You'll all suffer!

55:14.104 --> 55:16.572
I'll show the lot of you!

55:16.674 --> 55:20.110
I'm gonna be a star!

55:23.913 --> 55:26.006
Vegetables again.

55:26.082 --> 55:28.744
I'll be sprouting
bloody feelers soon.

55:28.852 --> 55:31.719
Must be 20,000 sheep
out there on those volcanoes,

55:31.821 --> 55:34.415
and we got a plate
full of carrots.

55:34.524 --> 55:37.891
- There's black puddings in it.
- Black puddings are no good to us.

55:37.994 --> 55:40.791
I want something's flesh!

55:52.374 --> 55:55.138
Look! Come here!
Down here. Look.

55:55.244 --> 55:57.973
Under the rock. I can see it.

55:59.213 --> 56:01.909
See him? Look.

56:02.016 --> 56:04.246
He's over there.
Look. Here.

56:04.352 --> 56:07.185
There's two of them here.
Look. Come on, come on.

56:07.288 --> 56:09.449
Where?

56:32.578 --> 56:35.775
I think I'll call myself
Donald Twain.

56:36.882 --> 56:41.012
Stop. Get down.

56:42.588 --> 56:45.055
It's him.
What does he want?

56:45.156 --> 56:48.523
- Go down there and ask him.
- Don't be a fool. He's got a gun.

56:48.626 --> 56:51.288
Bastard's psychotic.
You've only got to look at him.

57:01.605 --> 57:04.836
This place has become impossible.

57:04.942 --> 57:08.400
Perpetual rain, freezing cold.

57:08.512 --> 57:11.276
Now a bloody madman
on the prowl outside with eels.

57:11.381 --> 57:14.145
All right,
you made your point.

57:14.251 --> 57:17.413
We pack up.
We get out tomorrow.

57:17.520 --> 57:19.613
- What are you doing?
- I'm going for a slash.

57:19.722 --> 57:22.316
No, you're not. I can't get
my boots on when they're hot.

57:22.425 --> 57:25.155
- I'll go alone.
- You're not leaving me in here alone.

57:25.261 --> 57:28.822
<i>- Those are the kind of windows faces look in at.
- Then I won't have a slash.</i>

57:28.931 --> 57:31.161
And in both our interests, I think
we should sleep together tonight.

57:31.267 --> 57:34.326
Don't be ridiculous.
He's not gonna come up here in the dark.

57:34.436 --> 57:36.836
Of course he is.
If he catches one of us,

57:36.938 --> 57:39.668
he's got a better chance
of dealing with the other.

57:39.774 --> 57:42.368
<i>No.</i>

57:55.422 --> 57:58.789
What's the matter with you?
What are you laughing at?

57:58.892 --> 58:01.258
I was dreaming.
What do you want?

58:01.362 --> 58:04.820
You frightened the piss out of me.
Move over. I'm getting in.

58:09.369 --> 58:12.861
Oh, this is ridiculous.
I'll have to sleep in your bed.

58:12.972 --> 58:15.372
- I'll have to come with you.
- Will you get out?

58:15.475 --> 58:18.239
- No.
- All right, then I will.

58:26.685 --> 58:29.586
All right, you can stay,
but the gun doesn't.

58:29.688 --> 58:32.384
No. I have to keep the gun.
I intend to remain awake.

58:32.491 --> 58:35.085
- This is my bed, and I demand precedence.
- No!

58:40.831 --> 58:44.062
Mad fucking bastard!

59:06.723 --> 59:09.692
Shhh! Shhh!

59:09.793 --> 59:12.920
- Listen.
- There is nothing! Get to bed!

59:13.028 --> 59:15.428
I heard a noise.

59:15.531 --> 59:17.431
I must get in.

59:19.234 --> 59:22.692
<i>Oh, for fuck's sake.</i>

59:22.805 --> 59:25.000
- What was that?
- That's it. That's it.

59:25.107 --> 59:27.701
- What is it?
- It's the killer.

59:27.810 --> 59:31.768
<i>- It's probably foxes looking for grub.
- Listen. Listen.</i>

59:31.879 --> 59:34.609
Maybe it's the farmer.

59:34.715 --> 59:38.549
At 2:00 in the morning?
It's the killer.

59:38.653 --> 59:42.145
He's come to kill us.
What are we gonna do?

59:44.725 --> 59:47.659
He wants to come in.
He's trying to get in.

59:47.761 --> 59:50.753
He can't. He'll go away.

59:50.864 --> 59:52.957
He's going away.

59:58.338 --> 01:00:00.465
<i>This is all your fault.</i>

01:00:00.574 --> 01:00:03.542
You've even given him
the fucking gun.

01:00:08.447 --> 01:00:11.644
He's coming through the window.
He's getting in.

01:00:11.750 --> 01:00:14.913
- Give me the matches.
- Downstairs.

01:00:16.589 --> 01:00:21.150
He's in.
He's sharpening a fucking knife.

01:00:23.361 --> 01:00:26.762
We'll have to tackle him. You stay
in bed, pretending to be asleep.

01:00:26.865 --> 01:00:29.766
He'll go for you.
When he does, I'll jump on his back.

01:00:29.868 --> 01:00:32.803
No, no, no. It'll be too late.
I'll be knifed by then.

01:00:32.904 --> 01:00:35.736
We'll have to try
and make friends with him.

01:00:41.778 --> 01:00:45.145
They're going into your room.
It's you he wants.

01:00:45.249 --> 01:00:48.412
Offer him yourself.

01:00:59.162 --> 01:01:02.495
We mean no harm!

01:01:02.598 --> 01:01:06.932
<i>Oh, my boys!
My boys! Forgive me!</i>

01:01:07.035 --> 01:01:11.131
- Monty! Monty, Monty!
- Monty, you terrible cunt!

01:01:11.239 --> 01:01:14.470
<i>Forgive me. It was inconsiderate
of me not to have telegrammed.</i>

01:01:14.576 --> 01:01:17.568
What are you doing, prowling around
in the middle of the fucking night!

01:01:17.679 --> 01:01:21.615
I had a punctured tire.
I had to wait an eon for assistance.

01:01:21.716 --> 01:01:25.014
I'm sorry if I frightened you.
I should have knocked, but...

01:01:25.119 --> 01:01:29.112
<i>- I- I-I'll sleep in the other
room, if I may. - Anywhere you like.</i>

01:01:29.223 --> 01:01:32.715
Uh, yes, well.
Uh... good night.

01:01:36.897 --> 01:01:40.059
Brrr! Ah, good morning.
Did you sleep well?

01:01:40.166 --> 01:01:42.066
Mm-hmm.

01:01:46.639 --> 01:01:50.006
Um, I-I-I do apologize
for last night.

01:01:50.109 --> 01:01:54.011
- It was perfectly inconsiderate of me.
- It's perfectly all right, Monty.

01:01:54.113 --> 01:01:56.945
- You've been busy in here?
- As a bee.

01:01:57.049 --> 01:02:00.985
- How did you repair the window?
- Oh, I didn't break it.

01:02:01.086 --> 01:02:05.750
Merely forced it a little.
Sorry if I frightened you.

01:02:05.857 --> 01:02:08.951
There was an empty
wine bottle on the ledge.

01:02:09.061 --> 01:02:12.189
Oh, tomatoes. Yes.

01:02:17.835 --> 01:02:21.293
<i>Why don't you go and wake him?
Breakfast in 15 minutes.</i>

01:02:21.405 --> 01:02:25.739
The old order changeth,

01:02:25.843 --> 01:02:29.334
yielding place to new.

01:02:29.446 --> 01:02:34.179
And God fulfills Himself
in many ways.

01:02:34.284 --> 01:02:36.752
And soon...

01:02:37.854 --> 01:02:40.152
I suppose...

01:02:40.257 --> 01:02:42.350
I shall be swept away...

01:02:42.459 --> 01:02:45.757
by some vulgar little tumor.

01:02:47.229 --> 01:02:49.663
Oh, my boys.

01:02:49.765 --> 01:02:53.223
My boys,
we're at the end of an age.

01:02:53.335 --> 01:02:56.634
We live in a land
of weather forecasts...

01:02:56.739 --> 01:02:59.640
and breakfasts that 'set in,'

01:02:59.742 --> 01:03:03.677
shat on by Tories,
shoveled up by Labor.

01:03:03.778 --> 01:03:07.578
And here we are... we three...

01:03:07.682 --> 01:03:12.085
perhaps the last island
of beauty in the world.

01:03:15.189 --> 01:03:19.056
Now, which of you is going to be
a splendid fellow...

01:03:19.159 --> 01:03:22.151
and go down to the Rolls
for the rest of the wine?

01:03:22.262 --> 01:03:25.527
- I will.
- No, I'd better go. I wanna dig the car out anyway.

01:03:25.632 --> 01:03:29.398
- But we have my car, dear boy.
- Yes, but if it rains, we're buggered.

01:03:29.503 --> 01:03:31.835
- I mean...
- Stranded!

01:03:31.938 --> 01:03:35.429
- We'll leave the car till later. Leave this to me.
- I'll come. I fancy a walk.

01:03:35.541 --> 01:03:39.375
No, I hear you're a little wizard in the
kitchen. I shall need you, to work the joint.

01:03:39.478 --> 01:03:44.347
<i>- Yeah, you're the cook.
- And... what on earth are those?</i>

01:03:44.450 --> 01:03:46.782
- We forgot to bring our Wellingtons.
- Oh, but how dreadful.

01:03:46.886 --> 01:03:50.117
Do you mean you've been up here in all this
beastly mud and oomska without Wellingtons?

01:03:50.222 --> 01:03:53.019
Well, this afternoon
I shall take you both into Penrith...

01:03:53.124 --> 01:03:56.753
and get you fitted with some
good quality rubber boots.

01:04:00.365 --> 01:04:03.857
Garlic, rosemary and salt.

01:04:05.603 --> 01:04:08.594
I brought two of these in case either
of you was any good in the kitchen.

01:04:08.706 --> 01:04:11.971
- I'm not.
- Of course you are. Cooking is one of the natural instincts.

01:04:12.076 --> 01:04:15.807
Listen, Monty.
This is all very kind of you,

01:04:15.913 --> 01:04:18.381
but I really think I ought to be
out there getting work done on the car.

01:04:18.482 --> 01:04:21.076
You haven't time.
We're taking late luncheon at 3:00.

01:04:21.185 --> 01:04:24.244
- I'm afraid we have to leave by 3:00, Monty.
- Leave?

01:04:24.354 --> 01:04:27.221
Oh, didn't he tell you?
We have to get back to sign on.

01:04:27.323 --> 01:04:32.818
- Sign on? At the Labor Exchange?
- Yeah.

01:04:32.929 --> 01:04:37.298
It's sort of fashionable, actually.
All the actors do it. Even Redgrave.

01:04:38.968 --> 01:04:43.336
But surely you could forego
for just this one occasion.

01:04:43.438 --> 01:04:46.271
I've come a very long way
to see you both.

01:04:46.375 --> 01:04:51.312
<i>Can't, actually. I mean, I'd love to stay,
but he's more adamant to get back than I am.</i>

01:04:51.413 --> 01:04:54.541
Then we must choose
our moment...

01:04:56.784 --> 01:05:00.049
and have a word with him.

01:05:02.656 --> 01:05:05.420
I'm sure together
we could persuade him.

01:05:07.995 --> 01:05:11.487
There. Now, garlic,

01:05:11.599 --> 01:05:14.260
rosemary and salt.

01:05:14.367 --> 01:05:17.564
I can never touch meat
until it's cooked.

01:05:17.670 --> 01:05:20.935
As a youth, I used to weep
in butcher shops.

01:05:21.040 --> 01:05:24.203
<i>- I can't find the rosemary.
- Ah.</i>

01:05:26.279 --> 01:05:29.146
Can't find the rosemary.

01:05:30.816 --> 01:05:32.784
I'm sure we could find it
together.

01:05:35.687 --> 01:05:38.781
- Perhaps it's in the other bag.
- Perhaps it is.

01:05:38.891 --> 01:05:40.791
Shall we look?

01:05:44.630 --> 01:05:47.154
Oh, sorry. Sherry's in there.

01:05:52.637 --> 01:05:55.697
What do you mean, "sorry"? What's
going on? What's he doing here?

01:05:55.807 --> 01:05:58.071
We can't stay.
He won't leave me alone.

01:05:58.176 --> 01:06:00.576
<i>All right. We'll get the lunch done,
and then we'll leave.</i>

01:06:02.312 --> 01:06:05.873
I'm afraid
we must drink from these.

01:06:10.954 --> 01:06:14.219
I trust their shapes
will not offend your palates.

01:06:14.324 --> 01:06:18.726
- Chin-chin.
- To a delightful weekend in the country.

01:06:43.251 --> 01:06:45.583
I do think you could have shaved.

01:06:45.687 --> 01:06:48.781
What on earth will people
think of me turning up with you two?

01:06:48.890 --> 01:06:51.188
You look like a pair
of farm hands.

01:06:57.264 --> 01:06:59.164
Tsk!

01:06:59.266 --> 01:07:01.166
This is most embarrassing.

01:07:03.403 --> 01:07:05.871
Get away from the car.

01:07:05.973 --> 01:07:08.873
Buy the Wellingtons.

01:07:08.975 --> 01:07:12.376
I'm going to buy some razors
and shaving soap.

01:07:12.478 --> 01:07:15.242
I'll see you over there
in half an hour.

01:07:15.348 --> 01:07:18.249
- Pair of blues.
- One each.

01:07:19.752 --> 01:07:22.220
- I think a drink, don't you?
- What about the Wellingtons?

01:07:22.321 --> 01:07:24.220
Oh, bollocks
to the Wellingtons.

01:07:24.322 --> 01:07:27.223
We'll tell them they had a farmer's
conference and had a run on them.

01:07:36.701 --> 01:07:39.795
Okay. Yeah. Promise.

01:07:39.905 --> 01:07:42.270
Bye.

01:07:45.576 --> 01:07:50.536
No, hasn't heard a thing.
Apparently, they're still seeing people.

01:07:50.648 --> 01:07:53.640
You don't want to go to Manchester
anyway. Play a bloody soldier?

01:07:53.751 --> 01:07:56.083
Don't I?
I damned well do.

01:07:56.186 --> 01:07:58.881
- It's a bloody good little theater.
- It's not much of a part, is it?

01:07:58.988 --> 01:08:00.956
Well, it's better than nothing.

01:08:01.057 --> 01:08:04.458
- They'll make you cut your hair.
- So what? You'd lose a leg.

01:08:04.561 --> 01:08:07.530
- Time gents, please.
- All right. We're gonna have to work quickly.

01:08:07.630 --> 01:08:11.293
A pair of quadruple whiskies
and another pair of pints, please.

01:08:15.470 --> 01:08:18.962
Where is he?
I'm utterly assholed.

01:08:19.073 --> 01:08:20.974
We're early.

01:08:22.978 --> 01:08:25.776
We want to get in there,
don't we?

01:08:25.881 --> 01:08:28.714
Eat some cake,
soak up the booze.

01:08:39.993 --> 01:08:42.292
- All right here?
- What do you want?

01:08:42.395 --> 01:08:46.524
- Cake. All right here?
- Uh, no. We're closing in a minute.

01:08:46.633 --> 01:08:49.033
We're leaving in a minute.

01:08:54.174 --> 01:08:58.372
- We want cake and tea.
- Didn't you hear?

01:08:58.478 --> 01:09:01.743
She said she'd closed.
What do you want in here?

01:09:01.848 --> 01:09:05.374
Cake.
What's it got to do with you?

01:09:05.484 --> 01:09:08.180
I happen to be the proprietor.

01:09:08.287 --> 01:09:10.720
Now, would you leave?

01:09:10.823 --> 01:09:14.020
Ah, I'm glad
you're the proprietor.

01:09:14.126 --> 01:09:17.060
I was gonna have to have
a word with you anyway.

01:09:17.162 --> 01:09:19.595
We're working on a film up here.

01:09:19.697 --> 01:09:22.221
Location, see.

01:09:22.332 --> 01:09:24.995
We might want to do
a film in here.

01:09:25.103 --> 01:09:29.733
- You're drunk.
- Just bring out the cakes. Cake and fine wine.

01:09:29.841 --> 01:09:33.174
- If you don't leave, we'll call the police.
- Balls!

01:09:33.277 --> 01:09:35.904
We want the finest wines
available to humanity.

01:09:36.013 --> 01:09:38.379
And we want them here,
and we want them now.

01:09:38.482 --> 01:09:40.848
<i>Miss Blenehassitt, telephone the police.</i>

01:09:40.951 --> 01:09:45.354
It's all right,
Miss Blenehassitt.

01:09:45.455 --> 01:09:49.653
<i>I'm warning you,
if you do, you're fired.</i>

01:09:49.760 --> 01:09:52.250
We're multimillionaires.

01:09:52.361 --> 01:09:54.693
We shall buy this place
and fire you immediately.

01:09:54.797 --> 01:09:59.734
Yes, we'll buy this place, and we'll
install a fucking jukebox in here...

01:09:59.835 --> 01:10:03.362
and liven
all of you stiffs up a bit.

01:10:03.472 --> 01:10:05.838
The police, Miss Blenehassitt.

01:10:05.941 --> 01:10:09.899
Just say there are a couple of drunks in the
Penrith Tea Rooms, and we want them removed.

01:10:10.011 --> 01:10:13.378
We are not drunks.
We are multimillionaires.

01:10:13.481 --> 01:10:16.882
Hurry up, Mabs.
We'll keep them here till they arrive.

01:10:16.985 --> 01:10:19.146
<i>You won't keep us anywhere.</i>

01:10:19.254 --> 01:10:21.381
We'll buy this place
and have it knocked down.

01:10:21.489 --> 01:10:23.787
<i>- Right, right, right.
- Police, please.</i>

01:10:23.892 --> 01:10:26.519
Right. We're going.

01:10:26.627 --> 01:10:29.619
Our car has arrived.

01:10:29.730 --> 01:10:32.255
We'll be back.

01:10:32.366 --> 01:10:36.359
<i>We're coming back in here.</i>

01:10:41.374 --> 01:10:44.036
- Where is he?
- Sulking up the hill.

01:10:44.143 --> 01:10:46.509
He says he won't come in
for lunch without an apology.

01:10:46.612 --> 01:10:49.012
Suits me.
He can eat his fucking radish.

01:10:50.783 --> 01:10:52.683
It's all your fault.

01:10:52.785 --> 01:10:56.687
- You lead him astray.
- I beg your pardon, Monty.

01:10:56.789 --> 01:11:00.918
Don't tell me you're not aware of it.
I know what you're up to, and so do you.

01:11:01.026 --> 01:11:04.518
- Sherry?
- Sherry? Oh, dear, no, no, no.

01:11:04.629 --> 01:11:09.191
I'd be sucked into his trap.
One of us has got to stay on guard.

01:11:09.301 --> 01:11:12.464
He's so mauve.
We don't know what he's planning.

01:11:23.013 --> 01:11:26.244
I'm preparing myself
to forgive you.

01:11:28.219 --> 01:11:31.153
I think
you've been punished enough.

01:11:32.889 --> 01:11:36.256
I think we'd better release you
from the légumes...

01:11:36.359 --> 01:11:38.850
and transfer your talents
to the meat.

01:11:46.336 --> 01:11:49.168
You shouldn't treat each other
so badly.

01:11:49.271 --> 01:11:52.365
This boy's been out there
frozen to the marrow,

01:11:52.474 --> 01:11:54.874
and you just sit in here
drinking.

01:11:54.977 --> 01:11:59.107
Come along. He's going to revitalize himself,
and you're going to finish the vegetables.

01:11:59.214 --> 01:12:01.648
- I don't know how to do them.
- Well, of course you don't.

01:12:01.750 --> 01:12:04.149
You are incapable of indulging
in anything but pleasure.

01:12:04.252 --> 01:12:07.187
Am I not right?
You don't deserve such loyalty.

01:12:07.288 --> 01:12:11.918
Now, come along. I'm going
to teach you how to peel a potato.

01:12:17.265 --> 01:12:20.495
Isn't it stimulating, getting back
to a basic sort of life for a while?

01:12:20.600 --> 01:12:23.364
- Yes.
- Surrounded by trees and nature,

01:12:23.470 --> 01:12:26.462
one feels a glorious stirring
of the senses...

01:12:26.573 --> 01:12:28.871
a rejection
of poisonous inhibition...

01:12:28.975 --> 01:12:31.466
and a fecund motion of the soul.

01:12:31.578 --> 01:12:36.640
Except, of course, the problems
tend to take the edge off the pleasure.

01:12:36.749 --> 01:12:41.243
I mean, with no proper facilities.

01:12:41.353 --> 01:12:45.050
All the glorious trials
of youth, dear boy.

01:12:45.157 --> 01:12:50.823
When I was a lad, I'd rocket off on my tandem
with Wrigglesworth, and we'd just ride and ride.

01:12:50.930 --> 01:12:55.696
And at night we'd find
some barn and fall asleep,

01:12:55.800 --> 01:12:59.361
with the perfumes of nature
sighing on our skin.

01:12:59.470 --> 01:13:02.997
Would it be in bad form
to plagiarize a toast?

01:13:03.107 --> 01:13:05.940
It depends entirely
on the quality of the wine.

01:13:06.044 --> 01:13:09.308
In this instance,
it most certainly would not.

01:13:09.413 --> 01:13:13.975
In that case, to a delightful
weekend in the country.

01:13:14.084 --> 01:13:15.984
<i>Oh, splendid!</i>

01:13:19.857 --> 01:13:22.655
We expected a volley of argument
concerning Mr. Redgrave.

01:13:22.759 --> 01:13:26.421
- We're forgetting aboutJake...
- Not another word.

01:13:26.529 --> 01:13:28.724
Not another word.
Jake can wait too.

01:13:28.831 --> 01:13:32.289
Jake isn't a friend, Monty.
I'd hoped to avoid telling you this,

01:13:32.401 --> 01:13:35.165
but there's a psychotic
on the prowl outside this house.

01:13:35.271 --> 01:13:39.105
Ask him if I exaggerate.
He's threatened us, and he's dangerous.

01:13:39.208 --> 01:13:41.233
Is this true?

01:13:41.343 --> 01:13:44.403
Well, there's this local type
hanging about.

01:13:44.512 --> 01:13:48.972
A poacher. We got into a tiff,
and he threatened me with a dead fish.

01:13:49.084 --> 01:13:51.848
Yes, it was rather amusing, actually.

01:13:51.953 --> 01:13:55.150
<i>When you came in,
we thought it was him.</i>

01:13:55.257 --> 01:13:59.352
And we thought that you
cleaning your boots...

01:13:59.460 --> 01:14:01.360
was him sharpening his knife.

01:14:04.164 --> 01:14:07.292
Oh, how delicious.

01:14:07.401 --> 01:14:10.928
Mmm, more meat?

01:14:11.038 --> 01:14:13.506
No, thank you.
I'll go out for a walk.

01:14:13.607 --> 01:14:17.633
Oh, wait for us to finish,
dear boy. We'll all go.

01:14:20.079 --> 01:14:24.175
Listen, I know what you're thinking,
but I had no alternative.

01:14:24.284 --> 01:14:27.048
The old bugger's come a long way, and
I didn't want to put the wind up him.

01:14:27.153 --> 01:14:29.314
Your sensitivity overwhelms me.

01:14:29.422 --> 01:14:32.948
If you think you're gonna have
a weekend's indulgence at his expense,

01:14:33.058 --> 01:14:35.618
which means him having
a weekend's indulgence at my expense,

01:14:35.727 --> 01:14:37.957
- you've got another thing coming.
- I give you my word.

01:14:38.063 --> 01:14:40.827
- We'll leave first thing tomorrow morning.
- Tomorrow? What about tonight?

01:14:40.933 --> 01:14:43.333
- He's not gonna try anything.
- Of course he is!

01:14:43.435 --> 01:14:47.268
- He means business.
- Anyway, he sent me out to tell you coffee's ready.

01:14:47.371 --> 01:14:50.772
I couldn't drink it. I've got
a cramp in the mouth from grinning.

01:14:50.875 --> 01:14:53.343
- Well, stop smiling at him.
- I can't help it.

01:14:53.444 --> 01:14:56.538
I'm so uptight with him,
I can't stop myself.

01:14:58.716 --> 01:15:02.516
<i>"Laisse-moir respirir,</i>

01:15:02.586 --> 01:15:07.488
<i>longtemps longtemps
L 'odeur de tes cheveux. "</i>

01:15:07.590 --> 01:15:10.753
Ah, Baudelaire.

01:15:10.860 --> 01:15:14.523
Brings back such memories
of Oxford!

01:15:14.631 --> 01:15:16.622
Oh, Oxford!

01:15:16.733 --> 01:15:20.259
<i>Followed by yet another
anecdote about his sensitive crimes...</i>

01:15:20.369 --> 01:15:22.530
<i>in a punt with a chap
called Norman...</i>

01:15:22.638 --> 01:15:24.538
<i>who had red hair
and a book of poetry...</i>

01:15:24.640 --> 01:15:26.767
<i>stained with the butter drips
from crumpets.</i>

01:15:26.875 --> 01:15:29.969
I often wonder
where Norman is now.

01:15:30.079 --> 01:15:32.377
Probably wintering
with his mother in Guildford.

01:15:32.481 --> 01:15:34.381
A cat and rain.

01:15:34.483 --> 01:15:36.382
Vim under the sink.

01:15:36.484 --> 01:15:39.510
And both bars on.

01:15:39.620 --> 01:15:42.521
But old now... old.

01:15:42.623 --> 01:15:45.285
There can be no true beauty
without decay.

01:15:45.393 --> 01:15:50.888
"A requiem for England. "
- How right you are. How right you are.

01:15:50.999 --> 01:15:54.490
We live in a kingdom of rains...

01:15:54.601 --> 01:15:58.401
where royalty comes in gangs.

01:15:58.505 --> 01:16:01.838
Come on, lads. Let's get home.
The sky is beginning to bruise.

01:16:01.942 --> 01:16:05.469
Night must fall,
and we shall be forced to camp.

01:16:07.114 --> 01:16:09.673
He's not in my room, all right?
That's the condition, all right?

01:16:09.782 --> 01:16:12.250
- All right.
- I want the room with the lock. Agree to that, or I'm off.

01:16:12.351 --> 01:16:14.251
All right. All right.

01:16:21.660 --> 01:16:25.595
<i>Good ol'Jake, eh?
I told you. He's back.</i>

01:16:25.697 --> 01:16:28.598
And that's precisely the reason
I'm off to London.

01:16:28.700 --> 01:16:31.396
Let's all have a good laugh,
eh, Withnail?

01:16:31.503 --> 01:16:34.597
Good ol'Jake is back.

01:16:34.706 --> 01:16:37.140
He's going away.
He's leaving.

01:16:37.242 --> 01:16:40.439
Come on. Let's pack up and get out
of here before it gets dark.

01:16:57.928 --> 01:17:01.658
"Here hare, here. "

01:17:02.765 --> 01:17:05.029
"Here hare, here. "

01:17:05.134 --> 01:17:07.034
Good ol'Jake.

01:17:16.378 --> 01:17:21.338
<i>Ace bets.
Ace bets two and it's over to you.</i>

01:17:21.416 --> 01:17:25.113
Your two and up two.

01:17:25.220 --> 01:17:27.120
<i>- Mmm.
- So that's four?</i>

01:17:27.222 --> 01:17:29.417
That's four.

01:17:31.358 --> 01:17:36.921
<i>- Four.
- This is for the raise. We'll see the two.</i>

01:17:37.031 --> 01:17:39.966
Now, last card up.

01:17:40.067 --> 01:17:42.092
"Looking a bit lonely, isn't he?"

01:17:42.203 --> 01:17:45.229
" He needs a queen
to come to the rescue. "

01:17:47.707 --> 01:17:50.437
And... oh!

01:17:53.413 --> 01:17:55.973
There she is.

01:17:56.082 --> 01:17:59.518
Oh!

01:18:03.755 --> 01:18:06.883
Well, it's the two queens
to beat.

01:18:20.905 --> 01:18:23.100
Another hand?

01:18:26.978 --> 01:18:29.947
I think we'd better
get him to bed.

01:18:30.047 --> 01:18:32.481
No, no. He's down here.

01:18:34.852 --> 01:18:37.081
You're in my room,
I'm in his room and he's down here.

01:18:37.187 --> 01:18:41.283
I wouldn't dream of depriving the dear fellow
of his bed, especially in that condition.

01:18:41.391 --> 01:18:44.087
- But it's agreed. It's what he wants.
- No, I don't.

01:18:44.194 --> 01:18:46.094
I wanna get to bed.

01:18:47.664 --> 01:18:50.633
All right then, lovey.
Let's get you to bed.

01:18:50.734 --> 01:18:53.167
Early night will do us both good.

01:18:55.304 --> 01:18:59.400
<i>- Night-night, then, Monty.
- I want to be alone!</i>

01:19:02.178 --> 01:19:04.078
I wanna be alone.

01:19:26.533 --> 01:19:29.093
I think he'd better
sleep alone tonight.

01:19:31.238 --> 01:19:35.675
- He doesn't want to sleep with you.
- Right.

01:19:35.776 --> 01:19:39.268
Well, you're in there,

01:19:39.379 --> 01:19:41.847
and I'll take these
and I'll have the couch.

01:19:43.349 --> 01:19:45.783
I'll say good night, then, Monty.

01:19:45.885 --> 01:19:50.117
You already have... twice.

01:20:18.716 --> 01:20:22.277
What is it, Monty? I'm terribly tired.
I need to go to sleep.

01:20:22.386 --> 01:20:25.822
<i>But not that tired, eh?</i>

01:20:30.961 --> 01:20:35.954
- Are you a sponge or a stone?
- What do you mean?

01:20:36.065 --> 01:20:39.557
<i>Do you like to experience
all facets of life?</i>

01:20:39.669 --> 01:20:43.161
Or do you shut yourself off
from new experience?

01:20:43.273 --> 01:20:45.537
<i>- I voted Conservative.
- Are you faithful?</i>

01:20:45.642 --> 01:20:49.077
- To whom?
- Faithfulness isn't selective.

01:20:49.177 --> 01:20:53.113
<i>I agree. It's more a question of
selecting to whom one will be faithful.</i>

01:20:53.215 --> 01:20:57.413
- Have you selected?
- I'm terribly tired.

01:20:57.519 --> 01:21:01.455
I've been watching you
all evening.

01:21:01.556 --> 01:21:04.718
You've been avoiding my eyes,
haven't you?

01:21:04.825 --> 01:21:07.225
- Your eyes?
- Mmm.

01:21:07.328 --> 01:21:10.695
At luncheon, you couldn't tear
your gaze from mine.

01:21:10.798 --> 01:21:13.358
This evening,
you barely looked at me.

01:21:13.467 --> 01:21:15.628
What did he say to you?

01:21:15.736 --> 01:21:18.603
<i>- Nothing.
- You can tell me.</i>

01:21:18.706 --> 01:21:21.333
I assure you, nothing, M-Monty.

01:21:21.441 --> 01:21:25.343
I'm terribly tired.
I need to go to bed.

01:21:25.445 --> 01:21:28.380
<i>Yes, you must, mustn't you?</i>

01:21:28.481 --> 01:21:31.109
Off you go, then.

01:21:31.217 --> 01:21:33.310
I'll sleep here.

01:21:33.420 --> 01:21:37.446
It won't be the first time
I've been left with the couch.

01:21:54.365 --> 01:21:56.856
Boy.

01:21:58.770 --> 01:22:01.568
Boy.

01:22:01.672 --> 01:22:05.699
I know you're not asleep, boy.

01:22:05.810 --> 01:22:09.644
<i>But he is.</i>

01:22:09.746 --> 01:22:13.341
I've been into his room.

01:22:13.450 --> 01:22:16.248
He won't hear a thing.

01:22:19.222 --> 01:22:21.122
I know you're not asleep, boy.

01:22:21.224 --> 01:22:24.387
No, I'm not.
What is it, Monty?

01:22:24.494 --> 01:22:28.452
What do you want?

01:22:28.564 --> 01:22:32.398
I had to come.
I tried not to.

01:22:32.501 --> 01:22:35.129
Oh, how I tried not to.

01:22:35.237 --> 01:22:37.535
Monty, there's something
I have to explain to you.

01:22:37.640 --> 01:22:40.040
You needn't explain.
He's told me everything.

01:22:40.142 --> 01:22:42.042
He told me that
first day you came to Chelsea.

01:22:42.144 --> 01:22:46.671
- What's he told you?
- He told me about your arrest in the Tottenham Court Road.

01:22:46.781 --> 01:22:49.249
He told me about your problems,

01:22:49.350 --> 01:22:52.080
how you feel, your desires.

01:22:52.187 --> 01:22:55.918
- Problems? What problems?
- You are a toilet trader.

01:22:56.024 --> 01:22:58.652
- He told you that?
- You mustn't blame him.

01:22:58.760 --> 01:23:02.923
You mustn't blame yourself. I know
how you feel and how difficult it is.

01:23:03.030 --> 01:23:08.297
And that's why you mustn't hold back, let
it ruin your youth as I nearly did over Eric.

01:23:08.402 --> 01:23:11.462
It's like a tide.
Give in to it, boy.

01:23:11.572 --> 01:23:15.974
Go with it.
It's society's crime, not ours.

01:23:16.075 --> 01:23:19.203
- I'm not homosexual, Monty.
- Yes, you are!

01:23:19.312 --> 01:23:23.043
Of course you are. You're
simply blackmailing your emotions...

01:23:23.149 --> 01:23:25.811
to avoid the realities
of your relationship with him.

01:23:25.918 --> 01:23:29.046
- What are you talking about?
- You love him.

01:23:29.155 --> 01:23:31.555
And it isn't his fault
he cannot love you...

01:23:31.657 --> 01:23:34.682
any more than it's mine
that I adore you.

01:23:38.463 --> 01:23:41.626
Couldn't we allow ourselves
just this one moment of indiscretion?

01:23:41.733 --> 01:23:43.633
- No!
- He need never know.

01:23:43.735 --> 01:23:46.829
I don't care what he knows! Monty,
you've gotta go! You've gotta leave!

01:23:46.938 --> 01:23:49.462
If you want to humiliate me,
humiliate me.

01:23:49.573 --> 01:23:51.507
I adore you.

01:23:51.609 --> 01:23:54.305
Tell him, if you must.
I no longer care.

01:23:54.411 --> 01:23:58.370
I mean to have you,
even if it must be burglary!

01:24:00.217 --> 01:24:02.117
It's not me, it's him!

01:24:08.158 --> 01:24:10.683
He lied to you.
We're an affair.

01:24:10.793 --> 01:24:13.523
We have been for years,
but he doesn't want you to know.

01:24:13.630 --> 01:24:17.532
He doesn't want anybody to know. We're
both in it. We're obsessed with each other.

01:24:17.634 --> 01:24:21.262
But he's ashamed. He refuses
to come out and accept what he is.

01:24:21.370 --> 01:24:24.168
That's why he's rejecting me
while you're here.

01:24:24.273 --> 01:24:29.040
On my life, Monty, this is the first night
we haven't slept together for six years.

01:24:29.144 --> 01:24:31.169
I can't cheat on him.
It would kill him.

01:24:31.280 --> 01:24:34.716
But he told me you were in purgatory
because he couldn't love you.

01:24:34.816 --> 01:24:37.807
<i>He's lying. Lying!</i>

01:24:37.919 --> 01:24:42.185
Oh, my dear boy.

01:24:42.290 --> 01:24:45.418
If I had known that, I would never
have attempted to come between you.

01:24:45.526 --> 01:24:47.960
I know that, Monty.

01:24:48.062 --> 01:24:50.530
I respect you
for your sensitivity.

01:24:50.631 --> 01:24:52.895
I thank you for it,

01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:55.263
but you must leave.

01:24:57.504 --> 01:25:00.632
Yes.

01:25:00.740 --> 01:25:04.107
Yes. You'd better go to him.

01:25:04.211 --> 01:25:06.406
Oh, I intend to.

01:25:06.513 --> 01:25:08.640
This instant.

01:25:09.082 --> 01:25:12.414
<i>Withnail, you bastard. Wake up.</i>

01:25:12.484 --> 01:25:17.512
Wake up, you bastard,
or I'll burn this bastard bed down.

01:25:17.623 --> 01:25:22.083
I deny all accusations.
What do you want?

01:25:22.194 --> 01:25:24.424
I have just narrowly avoided
having a buggering.

01:25:24.530 --> 01:25:27.498
I've come in here with the express
intention of wishing one on you.

01:25:27.599 --> 01:25:30.159
Having said that, I now intend
to leave for London.

01:25:30.268 --> 01:25:32.793
Hold on. Don't let your
imagination run away with you.

01:25:32.904 --> 01:25:35.202
Imagination? I just finished
fighting a naked man.

01:25:35.306 --> 01:25:37.774
How dare you tell him
I'm a toilet trader!

01:25:37.875 --> 01:25:40.435
It was a tactical necessity.

01:25:40.545 --> 01:25:43.377
If I hadn't told him you were active,
we'd never have got the cottage.

01:25:43.480 --> 01:25:45.380
I never have wanted it...
not with him in it!

01:25:45.482 --> 01:25:49.248
Geez. He'd come all this way.

01:25:49.353 --> 01:25:53.653
<i>- Monty? He'd go to New York.
- It was a calculated risk.</i>

01:25:53.757 --> 01:25:56.351
What is all this tactical
necessity and calculated risk?

01:25:56.460 --> 01:25:59.156
This is me naked in a corner!

01:25:59.263 --> 01:26:01.856
And how dare you tell him
I love you.

01:26:01.964 --> 01:26:04.797
And how dare you tell him
you rejected me.

01:26:04.900 --> 01:26:07.835
<i>- How dare you tell him that!
- Sorry about that.</i>

01:26:07.937 --> 01:26:11.304
Got a bit carried away.
Sort of said it without thinking.

01:26:11.407 --> 01:26:14.934
<i>Let me tell you something, Withnail. If
he comes into my room again, it's murder,</i>

01:26:15.044 --> 01:26:18.035
and you will be held
responsible in law.

01:26:23.985 --> 01:26:27.182
"Perhaps it is appropriate justice
for the eavesdropper...

01:26:27.289 --> 01:26:30.656
"that he should leave
as his trade determines...

01:26:30.759 --> 01:26:34.854
"in secrecy and in the dead of night.

01:26:34.962 --> 01:26:38.659
<i>- "I do sincerely hope that
you will find the happiness...</i>

01:26:38.766 --> 01:26:42.327
"which, alas,
has always been denied to me.

01:26:44.271 --> 01:26:47.331
"I am yours ever faithfully,

01:26:47.441 --> 01:26:49.340
Montague H. Withnail. "

01:26:51.044 --> 01:26:53.478
Poor old bastard.

01:26:53.579 --> 01:26:55.479
I would say...

01:26:57.016 --> 01:27:01.112
that that represents
a degree of hypocrisy...

01:27:01.220 --> 01:27:05.815
I've hitherto suspected in you but not
noticed, due to highly evasive skills.

01:27:05.924 --> 01:27:09.883
Christ, Withnail.
You'll suffer for this.

01:27:09.995 --> 01:27:12.429
What you have done
will have to be paid for.

01:27:12.531 --> 01:27:14.499
I will say one thing for Monty.

01:27:14.599 --> 01:27:16.794
He keeps a sensational cellar.

01:27:26.610 --> 01:27:29.238
<i>- Who's there?
- Telegram.</i>

01:27:53.236 --> 01:27:55.669
Well done.

01:27:55.771 --> 01:27:59.673
Well, it doesn't mean to say I've got it.
They probably just want to see me again.

01:28:02.644 --> 01:28:05.704
Well, that settles it, then.
We'll leave immediately.

01:28:05.814 --> 01:28:08.578
What?

01:28:08.684 --> 01:28:11.846
- Get your kit together. We're leaving in half an hour.
- Half an hour?

01:28:11.953 --> 01:28:14.854
Don't be ridiculous.
I need at least an hour for lunch.

01:28:23.631 --> 01:28:27.589
You've got a truck coming up.
About 200 yards.

01:28:27.701 --> 01:28:31.296
Followed by a left slow hander.

01:28:31.405 --> 01:28:34.238
This is insanity!
I can't keep this up!

01:28:34.341 --> 01:28:37.902
Stay in this lane.
Bear right. Bear right.

01:28:38.011 --> 01:28:40.571
What lane? What lane?
I can't see the fucking lane.

01:28:40.680 --> 01:28:43.114
Bear right! Bear right!
Bear right!

01:28:46.085 --> 01:28:50.488
That's it. Next garage, I've gotta
do something about that wiper.

01:28:50.589 --> 01:28:54.320
And I've got to get some sleep.

01:29:21.084 --> 01:29:24.485
- What's going on?
- I'm making time.

01:29:38.534 --> 01:29:41.970
<i>Are you out of your mind? Pull over.
You haven't got a license.</i>

01:29:42.071 --> 01:29:44.039
No. I'm making time.

01:29:54.549 --> 01:29:56.949
- Where are we?
- We're approaching London.

01:30:00.121 --> 01:30:04.387
- Here comes another fucker.

01:30:12.500 --> 01:30:15.128
- Oh, no!

01:30:15.236 --> 01:30:18.103
Perfectly all right.
Leave him to me.

01:30:18.205 --> 01:30:21.003
You're full of scotch,
you silly tool.

01:31:31.607 --> 01:31:35.065
A bit early in the morning
for festivities, isn't it?

01:31:35.177 --> 01:31:37.475
These aren't mine.
They belong to him.

01:31:37.580 --> 01:31:41.380
- You're drunk.
- I assure you I'm not, officer.

01:31:41.483 --> 01:31:44.747
Honestly,
I've only had a few ales.

01:31:44.852 --> 01:31:48.845
Out of the car... please.

01:31:48.957 --> 01:31:50.857
Sir.

01:31:57.899 --> 01:32:00.833
I want you to take one
deep breath and fill this bag.

01:32:02.436 --> 01:32:06.133
- Are you refusing to fill this bag?
- I most certainly am.

01:32:06.239 --> 01:32:09.470
- I'm placing you under arrest.
- Don't be ridiculous. I haven't done anything.

01:32:09.576 --> 01:32:11.771
- Come on.
- Look here, my cousin's a QC.

01:32:11.878 --> 01:32:13.778
Get in the back of the van!

01:32:26.892 --> 01:32:29.292
Hey, sarge,
what's that clown doing?

01:33:05.095 --> 01:33:08.495
- Where's our checks?
- Didn't sign on.

01:33:08.598 --> 01:33:11.829
That wouldn't make any difference
in last week's payments.

01:33:40.094 --> 01:33:42.858
What are you doing in my bed?

01:33:42.963 --> 01:33:47.457
- I've been asleep.
- Who is the huge spade in the bath?

01:33:47.568 --> 01:33:49.968
Presuming Ed.

01:33:50.071 --> 01:33:52.938
You've got ten minutes, right?
I want you out 'cause I want to get in.

01:33:53.040 --> 01:33:55.667
Ten minutes, right?
You better be on your feet.

01:33:59.045 --> 01:34:02.242
- How did you get in?
- Ingenuity, man.

01:34:02.348 --> 01:34:04.612
Come up the drain pipe.

01:34:04.718 --> 01:34:07.778
- Would you like a smoke?
- Yes.

01:34:07.887 --> 01:34:10.321
No, thanks.
I've got a call to make.

01:34:14.827 --> 01:34:16.761
What are you gonna do
with those?

01:34:16.862 --> 01:34:21.196
The joint I'm about to roll
requires a craftsman.

01:34:21.300 --> 01:34:23.791
It can utilize up to 12 skins.

01:34:23.902 --> 01:34:26.871
It is called
a Camberwell Carrot.

01:34:26.972 --> 01:34:29.371
It's impossible to use
12 papers in one joint.

01:34:29.474 --> 01:34:33.171
It's impossible to make
a Camberwell Carrot with anything less.

01:34:33.277 --> 01:34:36.041
- Who says it's a Camberwell Carrot?
- I do.

01:34:36.147 --> 01:34:39.947
I invented it in Camberwell,
and it looks like a carrot.

01:34:40.051 --> 01:34:43.145
Do you realize this gaff's
overwhelmed with rodents?

01:34:43.254 --> 01:34:45.813
When I come in, I seen one
the size of a fucking dog.

01:34:45.922 --> 01:34:49.050
<i>That is a dog. Belongs
to the fellow downstairs.</i>

01:34:49.159 --> 01:34:51.320
Does his dog get in the oven?

01:34:51.428 --> 01:34:54.659
- No, his dog doesn't come up here.
- Then it was a rodent.

01:34:54.765 --> 01:34:57.962
Opened the oven door, and
it was in there looking at me.

01:34:58.068 --> 01:35:02.333
Quite freaked me at the time.
I was gonna cook onions.

01:35:02.438 --> 01:35:04.633
- Are you going to bed now?
- No.

01:35:04.740 --> 01:35:06.640
Phone.

01:35:08.811 --> 01:35:11.803
- Who's he going to telephone?
- Squat Betty.

01:35:13.282 --> 01:35:16.649
His agent. He's wasting his time
because he won't be in.

01:35:40.674 --> 01:35:43.871
This'll tend
to make you very high.

01:35:47.114 --> 01:35:51.641
This grass is the most powerful
in the Western Hemisphere.

01:35:51.751 --> 01:35:55.881
I have it specially flown in
from my man in Mexico.

01:35:57.356 --> 01:35:59.654
He's an expert.

01:35:59.759 --> 01:36:02.227
His name is Juan.

01:36:02.328 --> 01:36:07.424
This grass grows at exactly
2,000 feet above sea level.

01:36:09.668 --> 01:36:12.000
You got the part, man?

01:36:16.541 --> 01:36:20.910
I got a different one.
They want me to play the lead.

01:36:21.012 --> 01:36:24.845
- Congratulations.
- Where exactly have you two been?

01:36:24.949 --> 01:36:29.113
- Holiday in the countryside.
- That's a very good idea.

01:36:29.220 --> 01:36:32.212
London is a country
coming down from its trip.

01:36:32.323 --> 01:36:36.521
<i>We are 91 days
from the end of this decade,</i>

01:36:36.627 --> 01:36:39.754
and there's gonna be
a lot of refugees.

01:36:42.665 --> 01:36:46.965
They'll be goin' round this town
shoutin', "Bring out your dead. "

01:36:49.239 --> 01:36:52.333
There was a geezer around here
the other day lookin' for you.

01:36:52.442 --> 01:36:54.706
<i>- What geezer?
- Some bald geezer.</i>

01:36:54.811 --> 01:36:59.144
Reckons you owe him 266 quid
back rent.

01:36:59.248 --> 01:37:04.242
I told him there's no question of payin'
rent on a property cut with rodents.

01:37:04.353 --> 01:37:06.480
He takes exception to this.

01:37:06.588 --> 01:37:09.079
Starts comin' on really bald
with me.

01:37:09.191 --> 01:37:12.557
- You mean ratty.
- I told him to piss off.

01:37:12.660 --> 01:37:14.890
You bloody fool.
We'll end up in court again.

01:37:14.996 --> 01:37:18.432
<i>- No we won't. It ain't legal.
- I assume we can quote you.</i>

01:37:18.532 --> 01:37:22.195
The law rather
appeals to me, actually.

01:37:27.408 --> 01:37:30.399
<i>Just high.</i>

01:37:32.212 --> 01:37:34.112
Stop laughing, Withnail.
This is serious.

01:37:34.214 --> 01:37:38.048
No, it ain't. I looked into it,
studied the papers.

01:37:38.151 --> 01:37:41.211
- What papers?
- Legal papers.

01:37:41.321 --> 01:37:43.949
<i>What papers, Danny?</i>

01:37:53.999 --> 01:37:57.230
He's got our checks.
What are you doing with these?

01:37:57.336 --> 01:38:00.964
<i>I was gonna cash 'em in for you.</i>

01:38:09.080 --> 01:38:13.073
For Christ's sake, Withnail, stop
laughing. This is a notice of eviction.

01:38:20.190 --> 01:38:22.488
Will you stop laughing?
They wanna throw us out.

01:38:24.795 --> 01:38:28.196
For God... Will you shut up, for
God's sake? You're giving me the fear.

01:38:28.298 --> 01:38:30.357
<i>Give me a downer, Danny.
My brain's capsizing.</i>

01:38:30.467 --> 01:38:32.594
- I've gone and fucked my brain!
- Change, man.

01:38:32.703 --> 01:38:36.103
<i>Find your neutral space.
You've got a rush.</i>

01:38:36.205 --> 01:38:39.368
It will pass. Be seated.

01:38:46.248 --> 01:38:48.148
Aren't you getting absurdly high?

01:38:48.250 --> 01:38:51.616
Precisely the reason
I'm smokin' it.

01:38:56.891 --> 01:38:58.916
I couldn't. I'm spaced.

01:38:59.027 --> 01:39:01.052
Not as spaced as your rodents.

01:39:01.162 --> 01:39:05.292
- Don't talk about them.
- I imagine they're talkin' to each other.

01:39:07.701 --> 01:39:10.135
<i>- What do you mean?
- I've dealt with 'em.</i>

01:39:10.237 --> 01:39:12.137
Dealt with 'em.
What the fuck do you mean?

01:39:12.239 --> 01:39:15.902
Dosed 'em. I expect
they're dead down the drain.

01:39:16.010 --> 01:39:18.979
Dead down the drain?
What have you done to them?

01:39:19.079 --> 01:39:22.537
Given them all drugged onions.

01:39:22.649 --> 01:39:25.481
Jesus Christ!
Why have you drugged their onions?

01:39:25.585 --> 01:39:28.748
Sit down, man.
Take control.

01:39:28.855 --> 01:39:31.585
Give me a Valium.
I'm getting the fear!

01:39:31.691 --> 01:39:33.989
<i>You have done something
to your brain.</i>

01:39:34.093 --> 01:39:35.993
You have made it high.

01:39:36.095 --> 01:39:41.031
If I lay ten mils of Diazepam on you,
you will do something else to your brain.

01:39:41.133 --> 01:39:45.331
You will make it low. Why trust
one drug and not the other?

01:39:45.437 --> 01:39:47.337
That's politics, isn't it?

01:39:47.439 --> 01:39:49.339
I'm gonna eat some sugar.

01:39:50.942 --> 01:39:53.672
I recommend
you smoke some more grass.

01:39:53.779 --> 01:39:56.406
No way. No fucking way.

01:39:56.514 --> 01:39:59.813
That is an unfortunate
political decision,

01:39:59.917 --> 01:40:02.317
reflectin' these times.

01:40:09.493 --> 01:40:12.052
<i>- What are you talking about, Danny?
- Politics, man.</i>

01:40:12.162 --> 01:40:14.687
If you were hanging on
to a rising balloon,

01:40:14.798 --> 01:40:17.460
you're presented
with a difficult decision...

01:40:17.567 --> 01:40:19.933
let go before it's too late?

01:40:20.036 --> 01:40:22.027
Or hang on
and keep getting higher?

01:40:22.138 --> 01:40:26.768
Posing the question, how long
can you keep a grip on the rope?

01:40:28.710 --> 01:40:31.406
They're sellin' hippie wigs
in Woolworth's, man.

01:40:32.948 --> 01:40:37.112
<i>The greatest decade in
the history of mankind is over.</i>

01:40:38.987 --> 01:40:43.014
And as Presuming Ed here
has so consistently pointed out...

01:40:44.126 --> 01:40:47.322
we have failed
to paint it black.

01:41:37.375 --> 01:41:40.435
My Dad'll pick up the boxes
in a week.

01:41:40.545 --> 01:41:42.809
And he's gonna do something
about the car.

01:41:44.916 --> 01:41:46.907
- I'm off now.
- Already?

01:41:47.018 --> 01:41:49.543
But I've got us a bottle open.

01:41:51.288 --> 01:41:53.654
I confiscated it
from Monty's supplies.

01:41:54.825 --> 01:41:57.953
'53 Margaux.
Best of the century.

01:41:59.229 --> 01:42:01.527
I'm sure he wouldn't resent us
a parting drink.

01:42:01.632 --> 01:42:04.795
I can't, Withnail. I've gotta walk
to the station. I'll be late.

01:42:04.902 --> 01:42:08.029
- There's always time for a drink.
- No.

01:42:08.137 --> 01:42:10.469
I don't have the time.

01:42:10.573 --> 01:42:14.236
All right. I'll walk with you
through the park.

01:42:16.245 --> 01:42:18.645
We can drink it on the way.

01:42:26.755 --> 01:42:29.280
No. No more, thank you.

01:42:29.391 --> 01:42:31.882
Listen, Withnail. It's a stinker.
Why don't you go back?

01:42:31.993 --> 01:42:34.928
- Because I wanna walk you to the station.
- Well, don't.

01:42:35.030 --> 01:42:37.498
Please don't.

01:42:37.599 --> 01:42:39.657
I really don't want you to.

01:42:48.709 --> 01:42:52.167
I shall miss you, Withnail.

01:42:52.279 --> 01:42:56.908
<i>I shall miss you too. Chin-chin.</i>

01:43:15.367 --> 01:43:18.928
"I have of late,
but wherefore I know not,

01:43:19.037 --> 01:43:21.801
"lost all my mirth.

01:43:21.907 --> 01:43:26.344
"And indeed it goes so heavily
with my disposition...

01:43:26.445 --> 01:43:28.844
"that this goodly frame the earth...

01:43:28.946 --> 01:43:32.404
"seems to me a sterile promontory.

01:43:35.553 --> 01:43:39.011
"It's a most excellent canopy, the air.

01:43:39.123 --> 01:43:43.583
"Look you, this brave,
o'er hanging firmament.

01:43:43.694 --> 01:43:47.686
"This majestical roof
fretted with golden fire.

01:43:47.797 --> 01:43:49.992
"Why, it appeareth nothing to me...

01:43:50.100 --> 01:43:55.197
"but a foul and pestilent
congregation of vapors.

01:43:55.305 --> 01:43:57.899
"What a piece of work is a man,

01:43:58.008 --> 01:44:00.340
"how noble in reason,

01:44:00.443 --> 01:44:03.172
"how infinite in faculties,

01:44:03.279 --> 01:44:05.804
"how like an angel in apprehension.

01:44:05.914 --> 01:44:08.314
"How like a god!

"The beauty of the world:

"Paragon of animals:

"Yet to me, what is
this quintessence of dust?

"Man delights not me.

"No, nor women neither.

01:44:26.200 --> 01:44:28.794
Nor women neither. "
