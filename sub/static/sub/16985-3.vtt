Right, who are we giving
our possessions to today?

00:40.000 --> 00:42.000
I am not going into Age Aid.
That woman is a nightmare.

00:42.000 --> 00:46.000
She's as deef as a post and
a rude cow intae the bargain.

00:46.000 --> 00:49.000
She blames ye cos she cannae
hear ye. Thinks yer mumblin'.

00:49.000 --> 00:53.000
I had to shout at the top of
ma voice, "It's a jumper!"

00:53.000 --> 00:55.000
And The Home Start Trust,
you can forget that

00:55.000 --> 00:58.000
because she is a snooty Nazi cow.

00:58.000 --> 01:00.000
Rejecting stuff from yer bag.
"No, no".

01:00.000 --> 01:02.000
Oh, aye, been there and done that.

01:02.000 --> 01:05.000
"There's a pair of trousers for
your charity, dear, cheery-by!"

01:05.000 --> 01:07.000
"Hold your horses!
Have these trousers been laundered?"

01:07.000 --> 01:11.000
"Naw, hen, of course not. I took a dump
in them this morning and just thought,

01:11.000 --> 01:13.000
"I'll bring them up here,
save me washing them!"

01:13.000 --> 01:15.000
"And if you hold the zipper up
to yer beak,

01:15.000 --> 01:17.000
"you'll detect the unmistakable
whiff of pish."

01:17.000 --> 01:19.000
"Get them washed, get them hung up

01:19.000 --> 01:22.000
"and get on with yer charity work,
ya Hitler bastard."

01:24.000 --> 01:25.000
That's my wee stable all set out.

01:25.000 --> 01:28.000
All powdered off with white pepper.

01:28.000 --> 01:31.000
Delicious!

01:31.000 --> 01:33.000
Oh, racing...on.

FAINT COMMENTARY

01:37.000 --> 01:38.000
You can shut up, for a start.

01:38.000 --> 01:42.000
You'll no be ruining my wee
self party with your free boiler,

01:42.000 --> 01:44.000
or accident that I havenae
claimed for,

01:44.000 --> 01:46.000
or yer, indeed, your PPI pish.

01:49.000 --> 01:51.000
And that goes for you an' all.

01:51.000 --> 01:54.000
I'm no' interested in you.

01:54.000 --> 01:58.000
For, you are a Manila
envelope...with a window in it,

01:58.000 --> 02:01.000
which I have no intention
of keeking into.

02:02.000 --> 02:05.000
No joy has ever come of your kind.

02:08.000 --> 02:12.000
So, it's the cat charity again, eh?
Aye, where is that?

02:12.000 --> 02:14.000
Up there, sure.
Next to the suntan place.

02:14.000 --> 02:16.000
The suntan place? Aye, there.

02:16.000 --> 02:17.000
Browned Furra Pound.

02:17.000 --> 02:19.000
Oh, aye.

02:19.000 --> 02:21.000
So, what ye givin' them?

02:21.000 --> 02:23.000
Shirt. Still in the wrapper.

02:23.000 --> 02:25.000
John sent it over
about ten Christmases ago.

02:25.000 --> 02:28.000
It's no use. It's too big.
It's enormous!

02:28.000 --> 02:30.000
It's for a big, bubble-bodied,
fat fella.

02:31.000 --> 02:33.000
17.5 collar.

02:33.000 --> 02:35.000
That would do me. And I love maroon.

02:35.000 --> 02:39.000
Wish you health to wear it.
What have you got?

02:39.000 --> 02:42.000
Eh? Oh, aye, um...this.

02:42.000 --> 02:45.000
It's a monkey smoking a fag.
It's hideous, intit?

02:45.000 --> 02:47.000
I mean, what clown would gie ye that
as a gift?

02:47.000 --> 02:50.000
I got you that. Did ye? Aye.
Give it to me, I'll take it.

02:50.000 --> 02:52.000
If I'm honest, I bought it fur
myself, but yer birthday rolled up.

02:54.000 --> 02:56.000
Is that a tray?

02:56.000 --> 02:59.000
Aye. It's got a map
of Loch Lomond on it.

02:59.000 --> 03:03.000
Oh! I love maps! Haud the bus.
What are you gein me for it?

03:03.000 --> 03:04.000
Er...

03:05.000 --> 03:08.000
Recorder. It's Fiona's.
She was red rotten at it.

03:08.000 --> 03:09.000
It's fae Alicante.

03:09.000 --> 03:12.000
You say Alicante, I say AliCAN.

03:12.000 --> 03:14.000
To me! I'll get that learned.

03:14.000 --> 03:16.000
HE PLAYS A TUNE

03:17.000 --> 03:19.000
A spoon?

03:19.000 --> 03:21.000
A-huh, that's right, yes.

03:21.000 --> 03:24.000
It's for jam or sugar or salt, etc.

03:24.000 --> 03:26.000
It's from Troon.

03:26.000 --> 03:27.000
Oh, I see that.

03:27.000 --> 03:29.000
And the stuff in the bags,
is that for us?

03:29.000 --> 03:31.000
No, no, no. No, no, no, no, no.

03:31.000 --> 03:33.000
No, this is good stuff.
Naw, it's just the spoon today.

03:33.000 --> 03:35.000
So there ye have it.

03:35.000 --> 03:37.000
The spoon for stirring tea,
or coffee,

03:37.000 --> 03:40.000
or cod liver oil if you're no well.

03:40.000 --> 03:43.000
I'm across how a spoon works.

03:43.000 --> 03:44.000
The cats will be very grateful.

03:44.000 --> 03:46.000
Are ye no wantin' it, like?

03:46.000 --> 03:48.000
Hi, Jack. Victor.

03:48.000 --> 03:50.000
Oh, hello, Mick. You're no still
living underneath that bridge?

03:50.000 --> 03:53.000
Aye. Under the bridge,
like a mad troll, man.

03:53.000 --> 03:56.000
Oh, here, do you want a spoon?

03:56.000 --> 03:59.000
Oh! Haud on, ya daftie!

03:59.000 --> 04:01.000
(You cannae offer
a recovering junkie a spoon!)

04:01.000 --> 04:04.000
How no?
(He'll use it...for the junk!)

04:04.000 --> 04:07.000
Oh, aye, eating a big jar of junk.

04:07.000 --> 04:09.000
(They don't eat junk oota jar, Jack.

04:09.000 --> 04:11.000
(They cook it, on a spoon!)

04:12.000 --> 04:15.000
Cookin' up junk on ma wee
Troon spoon? (Aye!)

04:15.000 --> 04:18.000

04:18.000 --> 04:20.000
but yer no getting it noo

Thank you. Can I help you?

04:27.000 --> 04:29.000
I'm wanting this suit. A-huh.

04:29.000 --> 04:32.000
Thing is, it's ?6

04:32.000 --> 04:34.000
Would you take two? No.

04:34.000 --> 04:37.000
Eh, marvellous, eh?
Charity begins at home(!)

04:37.000 --> 04:39.000
It is a charity,
but it's also a business.

04:39.000 --> 04:41.000
We sell things for charity.

04:41.000 --> 04:45.000
The suit's ?6.
?6 in our till is a big help.

04:45.000 --> 04:46.000
Well, how about this, then?

04:46.000 --> 04:50.000
If we buy something at ?4, will
you let him have that suit for ?2?

04:50.000 --> 04:52.000
Yes. What have you got that's ?4?

04:52.000 --> 04:56.000
?4, please. It's a multipurpose
spoon from Troon.

Ya bastard!

05:18.000 --> 05:20.000
Y-a-a-a-a-ah!

05:22.000 --> 05:24.000
Four-a-half grand?!

05:24.000 --> 05:25.000
For a daft parking ticket?!

05:25.000 --> 05:28.000
What did ye dae,
shoot a traffic warden?

05:28.000 --> 05:29.000
You don't even have a car.

05:29.000 --> 05:32.000
Well, I did have a car,
for about a fortnight.

05:33.000 --> 05:36.000
1985. That's when I got the ticket.

05:36.000 --> 05:38.000
It's just ran up
and noo they're comin' efter me.

05:38.000 --> 05:41.000
What are you gonnie dae?

05:41.000 --> 05:44.000
Well, the letter says,

05:44.000 --> 05:45.000

05:45.000 --> 05:48.000
"the council shall endeavour
to recoup the goods,

05:48.000 --> 05:52.000
"chattel or possessions amounting
to the recovery of the debt."

05:52.000 --> 05:55.000
Well, that'll be the first
?3 paid back.

05:55.000 --> 05:57.000
Och shoosh! That's no the thing.

05:57.000 --> 06:01.000
I've got three weeks to pay,
or it's a custodial sentence.

06:01.000 --> 06:02.000
The jail? The pokey?

06:02.000 --> 06:04.000
The bumhole buffet?

06:04.000 --> 06:05.000
That cannae be right.

06:05.000 --> 06:07.000
It is right. Read it and weep.

06:07.000 --> 06:11.000
Wow, Winston,
that letter is a downer.

06:11.000 --> 06:16.000
However...this one is an upper.

06:16.000 --> 06:20.000
My invitation to receive the
Glasgow Good Citizen Civic Medal.

06:20.000 --> 06:25.000
Oh, aye, for cooking Pete the
Jakey's breakfast every morning

06:25.000 --> 06:27.000
oot the goodness of your heart.

06:27.000 --> 06:29.000
He doesnae have a heart. Pipe doon.

06:30.000 --> 06:31.000
A-hem!

06:31.000 --> 06:34.000
"Why are you receiving this award?

06:34.000 --> 06:40.000
"Because you have exemplified
a kindness or selflessness..."

06:40.000 --> 06:43.000
You're oot o' bog roll, Boabby.
Use newspaper, ya twat.

06:45.000 --> 06:48.000
"In other words,
your altruism and graciousness..."

06:48.000 --> 06:51.000
Can I get another wee splash
of cola in there, Boabby?

06:51.000 --> 06:55.000
There's cola in it already,
ya greedy old dick.

06:55.000 --> 06:57.000
"...has, above and beyond,

06:57.000 --> 07:01.000
"marked you as a citizen
of great standing."

07:01.000 --> 07:05.000
Boabby, can I...?
No, you cannae, ya miserable ratbag.

07:06.000 --> 07:11.000
"And, for these esteemed qualities,
we salute and reward you."

07:13.000 --> 07:16.000
The Glasgow Good Citizen's
Civic Medal?

07:16.000 --> 07:20.000
Are you sure it's no the Black-Hearted
Bawbag Barman Medallion?

07:20.000 --> 07:24.000
Or the Distinguished Doolally
Dickpiece Deadbeat Decoration?

07:24.000 --> 07:26.000
Great, eh?

07:26.000 --> 07:29.000
I get a ?4,500 parking ticket
and he gets a medal.

07:29.000 --> 07:31.000
Huh! That's both stones
firmly kicked.

07:31.000 --> 07:34.000
Oh, and there's a plus-one.

07:34.000 --> 07:35.000
Who's comin' wi' me?

07:35.000 --> 07:39.000
Eh? Oh, no, I'm, er...I'm washing
my moustache that day.

07:39.000 --> 07:41.000
I'm, er...I'm givin' him a hand.

07:43.000 --> 07:47.000
What aboot you, Isa? Or are you busy
washing your moustache?

07:47.000 --> 07:50.000
Heh! Um...
Tell him your washing your beard.

07:50.000 --> 07:56.000
Boabby! That would lovely,
but the thing is, erm...

07:56.000 --> 07:58.000
Well...?

07:59.000 --> 08:04.000
I cannae go because you'll need somebody
to cover for you here at The Clansman!

08:04.000 --> 08:06.000
Hee-hee-hee!

08:06.000 --> 08:08.000
Well, otherwise
that would have been lovely.

08:10.000 --> 08:14.000
Boabby, I'll ignore the fact
that you've asked everybody else,

08:14.000 --> 08:19.000
but can I put forward my case
for being your plus-one?

08:22.000 --> 08:26.000
As you all know, I've been in financial
trouble myself a couple of times.

08:26.000 --> 08:29.000
Gracious me, I am noo. Huh-huh!

08:29.000 --> 08:32.000
I'm what they call
a borderline case.

08:32.000 --> 08:34.000
Freddie Foodbank, if you will.

08:34.000 --> 08:36.000
And it's for that reason

08:36.000 --> 08:40.000
that I appreciate the charity
that you showed Pete.

08:41.000 --> 08:43.000
You deserve that medal.

08:43.000 --> 08:48.000
And I would be honoured to be there
to see you receive it.

08:48.000 --> 08:50.000
Because you are one hell of a fella,
Boabby.

08:52.000 --> 08:54.000
One hell of a fella.

08:54.000 --> 08:56.000
Thanks, Winston.

08:57.000 --> 08:59.000
I'd be delighted to have you there.

09:07.000 --> 09:09.000
Honoured to be there?

09:09.000 --> 09:11.000
A-huh. A helluva fella?

09:11.000 --> 09:13.000
A helluva gormless fella.

09:15.000 --> 09:18.000
I've just got an invite to
the inside of the City Chambers.

09:18.000 --> 09:23.000
Right. Where they have a lovely
ballroom for awards upstairs.

09:23.000 --> 09:26.000
And? And the fines and parking
department downstairs!

09:35.000 --> 09:36.000
Riddle me this, Batman.

09:36.000 --> 09:38.000
Off you go, Alfred.

09:38.000 --> 09:40.000
Who's Alfred? The butler.

09:40.000 --> 09:43.000
Whose butler? Batman's butler!

09:43.000 --> 09:46.000
Naw, I'm no the butler.
If yer no going to go Alfred,

09:46.000 --> 09:49.000
the only other people you can be
is Robin or Batgirl.

09:49.000 --> 09:51.000
Well, I've neither the tights
for Robin, nor the tits for Batgirl.

09:51.000 --> 09:54.000
No, I'm the Riddler,
so riddle me this!

09:54.000 --> 09:57.000
Well, go wi' it!
The question I'm asking is,

09:57.000 --> 10:00.000
is Boabby an arsehole
who became charitable,

10:00.000 --> 10:03.000
or is he a charitable man
who masquerades as an arsehole?

10:03.000 --> 10:06.000
Ah. Is he a benevolent man
that covers it with a mask

10:06.000 --> 10:08.000
and cape of arseholiness? Exactly.

10:08.000 --> 10:13.000
Naw. I reckon he's a fully-paid-up,
card-carrying arsehole.

10:13.000 --> 10:15.000
Aye, he's an arsehole.

10:15.000 --> 10:18.000
Yer no the Riddler, yer the Penguin.

10:18.000 --> 10:19.000
Oh. Am I?

10:21.000 --> 10:23.000
Weah, weah, weah, weah, weah!

10:23.000 --> 10:24.000
Watch the tea, Jack!

10:24.000 --> 10:26.000
THEY CHUCKLE

10:26.000 --> 10:27.000
DOORBELL

10:27.000 --> 10:29.000
Oh.

10:31.000 --> 10:33.000
Oh, Mick! Jack.

10:33.000 --> 10:35.000
What can I do for you, son?

10:35.000 --> 10:38.000
I wanted to say thanks for giving us
a dig-oot with the suit.

10:38.000 --> 10:40.000
Aye, nae problem, son, aye, aye.

10:40.000 --> 10:42.000
Just oot of curiosity,
what did you need the suit for?

10:42.000 --> 10:43.000
Yer no in trouble, are ye?

10:43.000 --> 10:45.000
Naw, quite the opposite.

10:45.000 --> 10:47.000
I've got an interview for a job.

10:47.000 --> 10:49.000
Oh, that's marvellous, eh?

10:49.000 --> 10:51.000
Well, so you're wanted kitted oot?

10:51.000 --> 10:53.000
Suit, shirt, tie, shoes,
the lot, eh?

10:53.000 --> 10:56.000
De ye think I'll need all that?
It's only a daft office job.

10:56.000 --> 10:57.000
Now, listen to me, ye young dumper.

10:57.000 --> 11:01.000
You go for that interview,
right, and then later on, they say,

11:01.000 --> 11:02.000
"Who do we like for this?"

11:02.000 --> 11:05.000
And the gaffer pipes up,
"I liked the boy with the suit."

11:05.000 --> 11:07.000
But the assistant says,
"Who was that wi' the suit?"

11:07.000 --> 11:08.000
He says,
"The boy wi' the suit, sure,

11:08.000 --> 11:11.000
"and the manky shirt
and the rotten flip-flops.

11:11.000 --> 11:12.000
"He's the boy for us".

11:12.000 --> 11:14.000
It's no going to work son, is it?

11:14.000 --> 11:15.000
You don't need that other stuff.

11:15.000 --> 11:18.000
"It is only with the heart we can
see fully,

11:18.000 --> 11:22.000
"what is essential
is invisible to the eyes."

11:22.000 --> 11:27.000
Antoine de Saint-Exupery, 1940.

11:27.000 --> 11:28.000
There or thereabouts.

11:28.000 --> 11:31.000
Right. What size are your shoes?

11:34.000 --> 11:36.000
10. Ah, you're pumped. I'm a 12.

11:36.000 --> 11:37.000
Ah, I'm a 9.

11:37.000 --> 11:39.000
Haud on. Two pair of socks
and a pair of ma shoes.

11:39.000 --> 11:42.000
What about a pair of my Colin's?
He's a 10.

11:42.000 --> 11:45.000
Have you still got
some of Colin's stuff?

11:45.000 --> 11:47.000
Aye. There's tons there.

11:47.000 --> 11:50.000
It's been lyin' there since
he went to the university.

11:50.000 --> 11:53.000

11:53.000 --> 11:56.000
Well, there ye go. That's smashin'.

11:58.000 --> 12:01.000
You guys have got it good,

12:01.000 --> 12:04.000
wi' a talking letterbox
that gies ye stuff.

12:04.000 --> 12:08.000
Eh? Mad hoose wi' a magic door.

12:08.000 --> 12:10.000
Aye, it's pure Pixar, innit?

12:11.000 --> 12:13.000
It's a woman!

12:13.000 --> 12:14.000
Right.

12:17.000 --> 12:19.000
Nice to meet ye, Missus.

12:21.000 --> 12:24.000
For God's sake!
This is oor neighbour, Isa.

12:24.000 --> 12:26.000
Hello, son.

12:26.000 --> 12:29.000
Noo, I've also got a nice overcoat
there you could use

12:29.000 --> 12:30.000
for if the weather's bad.

12:30.000 --> 12:34.000
Thanks. Haud on, but,
I might no need a coat.

12:40.000 --> 12:44.000
What will the weather be like
on Monday, magic door?

12:50.000 --> 12:53.000
Can you be quiet, please?
This is a library!

12:56.000 --> 12:59.000
Chattering away
like a couple of budgies!

12:59.000 --> 13:00.000
I couldnae hear a thing.

13:00.000 --> 13:03.000
Aye, well, they were deafening me.

13:03.000 --> 13:07.000
Noo, the way I see it, Winston,
when I click on this button,

13:07.000 --> 13:09.000
I'll be an accessory,
aiding and abetting ye.

13:09.000 --> 13:12.000
I like a bet as well, Shug.
I'm always betting.

13:12.000 --> 13:14.000
No, no, no, no' betting, abetting.

13:14.000 --> 13:19.000
Look, Shug, this is an ancient,
lousy parking ticket

13:19.000 --> 13:22.000
that over the years
has turned intae Bigfoot. Ah.

13:22.000 --> 13:25.000
We get in there, we find the cave
where Bigfoot lives,

13:25.000 --> 13:31.000
"Oh, hello, ya big ?4,500
hairy Sasquatch pain in the arse!"

13:31.000 --> 13:33.000
Blammo!

13:33.000 --> 13:36.000
No' crime, a hunt!
That's right, Shug.

13:36.000 --> 13:37.000
And what are we if not hunting men?

13:37.000 --> 13:39.000
And Sasquatch is the parking ticket?

13:39.000 --> 13:42.000
Yes! Aye, OK.

13:42.000 --> 13:44.000
Aye.

13:45.000 --> 13:47.000
Bingo! That's you.

13:47.000 --> 13:48.000
What am I looking at?

13:48.000 --> 13:52.000
Well, that's the original drawings
for the City Chambers, 1885.

13:52.000 --> 13:55.000
See, there's yer roof layout,

13:55.000 --> 13:57.000
there's your ballroom,
that's where you'll be.

13:57.000 --> 13:59.000
Watching Boabby getting
his stupid badge.

13:59.000 --> 14:01.000
Aye, well, you excuse yourself,

14:01.000 --> 14:03.000
you're...you're needing a pish
or some such.

14:03.000 --> 14:06.000
Cut through the kitchen,
along the corridor.

14:06.000 --> 14:08.000
The traffic fines office
is behind that,

14:08.000 --> 14:10.000
and that's where we need to be.

14:13.000 --> 14:16.000
So, what do we need -
torches, glasscutters?

14:16.000 --> 14:20.000
Possibly, what, welding gear
of some description?

14:20.000 --> 14:23.000
Gelignite! Will we need geli?

14:23.000 --> 14:28.000
The only jelly you'll be getting
is after yer dinner, ya fat clown.

14:28.000 --> 14:31.000
Cut down the fire stairs,
let me in the back door.

14:31.000 --> 14:35.000
4:30 on the button. Boom!

14:35.000 --> 14:37.000
Call me a fat clown!

14:39.000 --> 14:41.000
Do you think there will be jelly?

14:43.000 --> 14:46.000
He's had a shower and everything.
Wait till you see him.

14:46.000 --> 14:48.000
It wis very good of ye feeding
the boy like that, Isa.

14:48.000 --> 14:52.000
Sorry? I said, it wis very good
of ye feeding the boy like that.

14:52.000 --> 14:53.000
Do you know something, Isa?

14:53.000 --> 14:56.000
That's probably that boy's first
square meal in God-knows-how-long.

14:56.000 --> 14:59.000
Good on ye. He's a lucky lad.

14:59.000 --> 15:00.000
He's a lucky, lucky lad.

15:00.000 --> 15:03.000
Aye, well, he's welcome.

15:03.000 --> 15:05.000
Right, youse ready?

15:05.000 --> 15:07.000
Oh, come on in, son!

15:07.000 --> 15:08.000
Oh, the big reveal, eh!

15:08.000 --> 15:10.000
It's like one of they
makeover shows!

15:10.000 --> 15:13.000
Oh! Oh! Look at that!

15:13.000 --> 15:15.000
Shining like a new penny.

15:15.000 --> 15:18.000
Aye. You, boy, are ready
for that job interview.

15:20.000 --> 15:22.000
Oh! No, no, no. No, no.

15:22.000 --> 15:23.000
Oh, dear!

15:25.000 --> 15:27.000
Good of you to see us
at short notice like this, Cammy.

15:27.000 --> 15:29.000
No problem.

15:29.000 --> 15:31.000
Not long now.

15:31.000 --> 15:33.000
So, operating out o' the hoose now,
eh?

15:33.000 --> 15:35.000
Aye, since I got struck off.

15:35.000 --> 15:40.000
You pull four teeth out the wrong
person and everybody gangs nuts.

15:40.000 --> 15:42.000
I mean, how was I supposed to know

15:42.000 --> 15:44.000
she was the girl out
the toothpaste advert?

15:47.000 --> 15:50.000
So, are you still allowed
to use gas, Cammy?

15:50.000 --> 15:53.000
Well, I'm not going to chuck it out.

15:53.000 --> 15:55.000
I've got a garage full of it!

15:55.000 --> 15:56.000
Gas, man!

15:58.000 --> 16:00.000
I've never had gas before.

16:00.000 --> 16:01.000
Hee-hee-hee!

16:01.000 --> 16:03.000
You feelin' OK, Mick?

16:03.000 --> 16:05.000
Tae be honest wi' ye,
a wee bit depersonalised.

16:05.000 --> 16:08.000
Mebbe even de-realised.

16:08.000 --> 16:12.000
Also feeling high levels of
suggestibility and imagination,

16:12.000 --> 16:14.000
but overall, a slight dizziness

16:14.000 --> 16:17.000
blanketed in a deep-rooted euphoria.

16:17.000 --> 16:22.000
Get yersels tanked up wi'it,
it's aff its nut! Ha!

16:22.000 --> 16:23.000
Do you want to try some, lads?

16:23.000 --> 16:25.000
No, no. No, no.

16:25.000 --> 16:27.000
Hey, look at that!

16:27.000 --> 16:30.000
When's that fae?
I dunno, but it cost three-and-six.

16:30.000 --> 16:33.000
"At home with James Dean."
THEY CHUCKLE

16:33.000 --> 16:35.000
Look at this!

16:35.000 --> 16:39.000
"Engelbert Humperdinck celebrates
his 27th birthday in style."

16:39.000 --> 16:43.000
"Jackie O's stunning new wardrobe
ahead of Dallas trip."

16:44.000 --> 16:47.000
"Why the ladies love Liberace."

16:47.000 --> 16:49.000
Right, that's you, son.

16:49.000 --> 16:51.000
Got any mouthwash?

16:53.000 --> 16:54.000
Here, rinse with that.

16:54.000 --> 16:58.000
Right. So that's you sorted
for your interview tomorrow.

16:58.000 --> 16:59.000
What time's it at?

17:02.000 --> 17:04.000
4:30. How am I looking?

17:04.000 --> 17:07.000
Like the 2:30 favourite
at Cheltenham. Come on.

17:15.000 --> 17:17.000
HE INHALES

17:20.000 --> 17:22.000
What's wrong wi' you?
I'm just a wee bit nervous.

17:22.000 --> 17:25.000
What have you got to be nervous about?
It's me that's getting the medal.

17:25.000 --> 17:27.000
I'm nervous for you.

17:28.000 --> 17:30.000
All the chat and all that.

17:30.000 --> 17:33.000
Who we'll be sittin' wi'
and everything. Oh, gies peace!

17:37.000 --> 17:39.000
There, we're there, Table Four.

17:39.000 --> 17:42.000
Right, er... Hm!
I'm needing the toilet.

17:42.000 --> 17:45.000
You go and get yourself settled
and I'll get ye in there in five.

17:45.000 --> 17:47.000
Come on, we're due in there noo.
Move yer arse!

17:49.000 --> 17:51.000
There will be jelly, right?

18:03.000 --> 18:04.000
Winston? What?!

18:04.000 --> 18:07.000
What is it wi' you and that watch?

18:07.000 --> 18:09.000
I'm just anxious
to get to the toilet.

18:11.000 --> 18:14.000
Will you sit a bloody minute
until people sit down?

18:16.000 --> 18:18.000
Hi. I'm Boabby.

18:18.000 --> 18:22.000
Hi, I'm Rachel.
Are you winning something tonight?

18:22.000 --> 18:24.000
I am indeed.

18:24.000 --> 18:26.000
This must be the winners' enclosure.

18:26.000 --> 18:28.000
What are you receiving
your award for?

18:28.000 --> 18:34.000
Oh, I, er...looked after a homeless
guy for, um...quite some time.

18:35.000 --> 18:39.000
You? Myself and Caroline
jumped into the Maryhill Canal

18:39.000 --> 18:41.000
and saved a man from drowning.

18:43.000 --> 18:46.000
Firefighter. Art school.

18:46.000 --> 18:50.000
I quit my job and went around
Eastern Europe for two years

18:50.000 --> 18:55.000
with a puppet show that I performed
for children orphaned by war.

18:59.000 --> 19:03.000
I'm his plus-one
and I'm needing a shite.

19:08.000 --> 19:10.000
How's that a poached egg,
you silly bastard?

19:10.000 --> 19:14.000
It looks like something
that fell out your nose!

19:14.000 --> 19:16.000
Right, get it fixed, start again!

19:16.000 --> 19:19.000
I'm not serving that up,
you novice arsehole!

19:20.000 --> 19:22.000
And where do you think you're going,
fatty?!

19:22.000 --> 19:23.000
I was just, er...

19:23.000 --> 19:25.000
"I was just, er...just, er..."

19:25.000 --> 19:28.000
Just get the nibbles on the trays
and onto the tables!

19:28.000 --> 19:30.000
I was on my way to the toilet.

19:30.000 --> 19:32.000
Get those nibbles oot!

19:34.000 --> 19:35.000
Oi!

19:43.000 --> 19:45.000
(Winston! What the f...?)

19:48.000 --> 19:49.000
CLATTER!

19:53.000 --> 19:55.000
Ye all set for your interview, Mick?

19:55.000 --> 19:57.000
Look at that pigeon, man.
Look at the size of it!

19:57.000 --> 20:00.000
It looks as if it's ate
another pigeon.

20:00.000 --> 20:01.000
Never mind the pigeons.

20:01.000 --> 20:03.000
Look, I'll pretend to be
the interviewer

20:03.000 --> 20:05.000
and you introduce yourself to me.

20:05.000 --> 20:07.000
Hello, I'm Methadone Mick.

20:07.000 --> 20:09.000
I wouldn't say that.

20:09.000 --> 20:11.000
Hello, I'm Methadone Michael?

20:11.000 --> 20:14.000
Mick, you can drop the Methadone.

20:14.000 --> 20:17.000
Cannae man,
got tae have it every morning.

20:17.000 --> 20:20.000
Never mind that. Just say,
"Hello, my name is Michael",

20:20.000 --> 20:21.000
and then just be loose wi' it.

20:21.000 --> 20:25.000
Let's buy some pigeon feed.
That wee one looks starving.

20:25.000 --> 20:29.000
Look, gie it a rest wi' the pigeons.
Watch me. Watch and learn.

20:30.000 --> 20:32.000
Good afternoon. My name's Victor.

20:32.000 --> 20:33.000
Good afternoon, Victor.

20:33.000 --> 20:36.000
What makes you think
you're suited to the position?

20:36.000 --> 20:38.000
Ha-ha! That's an easy one, sir.

20:38.000 --> 20:41.000
30 years in the service of
Babcock and Wilcox, man and boy.

20:41.000 --> 20:45.000
Loyalty's my middle name,
diligence is my reason for being.

20:45.000 --> 20:47.000
Impressive. So therefore...

20:47.000 --> 20:49.000
Weesht! You've done enough.

20:49.000 --> 20:51.000
I see no reason why you can't start
on Monday.

20:51.000 --> 20:53.000
I'm over the moon.
Let me leave you with my CV.

20:56.000 --> 20:58.000
On the other hand, make it Tuesday.

20:58.000 --> 21:01.000
That'll give you a chance
to wipe that muck off your face.

21:02.000 --> 21:04.000
So that's basically it, Mick.

21:04.000 --> 21:07.000
Confident, forthright, be yersel'.
But without the shit.

21:09.000 --> 21:11.000
Good luck.

21:11.000 --> 21:12.000

21:24.000 --> 21:26.000

Sit yourself down.

22:07.000 --> 22:08.000
Michael, is it?

22:08.000 --> 22:10.000
Mick. Michael.

22:10.000 --> 22:11.000
Nothing to do with Methadone.

22:14.000 --> 22:17.000
OK, Mick. Why do you think
you're suited to this position?

22:17.000 --> 22:19.000
Ah!

22:19.000 --> 22:22.000
30 years in the service of
Babcock and Wilcox, man and boy.

22:22.000 --> 22:25.000
What age are you? 23.

22:30.000 --> 22:32.000

22:32.000 --> 22:36.000
Diligence is my reason for being
and I've no got shite on ma heid.

I beg your pardon?

22:37.000 --> 22:41.000
I've no got shite on ma face,
or anything like that.

22:51.000 --> 22:53.000
For God's sake, where have ye been?

22:53.000 --> 22:57.000
I was a baw hair away from gein
ma pension to a prostitute!

22:57.000 --> 22:58.000
(Shut up! Get in!)

23:01.000 --> 23:03.000
Well, Mick, we have others to see.

23:03.000 --> 23:05.000
Fair dos, Andra...Mr Gillespie.

23:05.000 --> 23:10.000
Here's the thing. See, my life, so
far, it's no been up to much, man.

23:10.000 --> 23:13.000
Hands up, it's been ma fault.

23:13.000 --> 23:16.000
But you see noo?
I'm clean, focused, man.

23:16.000 --> 23:18.000
My...my mad days are behind me.

23:18.000 --> 23:21.000
Well, you're remarkably
well-turned-out today.

23:21.000 --> 23:24.000
You'll love this. It's aff its nut.

23:24.000 --> 23:27.000
I got this suit fur ?6,

23:27.000 --> 23:29.000
but no really cos I only had two,

23:29.000 --> 23:33.000
but I got it anyroads cos
Jack and Victor bought a spoon.

23:33.000 --> 23:35.000
So that was excellent.

23:35.000 --> 23:38.000
Then I'm up at their door
and this wee magic letterbox

23:38.000 --> 23:41.000
starts talking to me

23:43.000 --> 23:45.000

24:01.000 --> 24:02.000
Then in the background...

24:02.000 --> 24:04.000
Ding-ding-ding!

24:04.000 --> 24:07.000
Old teeth in the bin,

25:05.000 --> 25:07.000

APPLAUSE

25:45.000 --> 25:47.000
Whoo-hoo! Whoo!

25:52.000 --> 25:54.000
My lords, ladies and gentlemen,

25:54.000 --> 25:58.000
thank you for that warm reception.

26:00.000 --> 26:04.000
Brian? I don't know who that man is,
but he's an impostor!

26:06.000 --> 26:07.000
Aw, for fu...!

26:13.000 --> 26:16.000
Mayhem. Absolute mayhem.
I thought I was getting the jail.

26:16.000 --> 26:18.000
So, how did you get off?

26:18.000 --> 26:21.000
The old silver tongue
got me off wi' it.

26:21.000 --> 26:24.000
Aye, that and a quarter of an hour
begging like a wee lassie.

26:24.000 --> 26:27.000
"Oh, I'm Boabby's plus-wan!
I'm Boabby's plus-wan!

26:27.000 --> 26:30.000
"I got lost in the corridors
cos I'm old and past it!"

26:30.000 --> 26:32.000
Aye, well, it worked, didn't it?

26:32.000 --> 26:34.000
And naebody none the wiser.

26:34.000 --> 26:36.000
None the wiser about what?

26:36.000 --> 26:37.000
That old parking ticket.

26:37.000 --> 26:40.000
That's why I went!
It's binned. History.

26:41.000 --> 26:43.000
Awright, troops?

26:43.000 --> 26:44.000
Oh, aye! Hey, Mick, How'd ye get on?

26:44.000 --> 26:46.000
I got it.
THEY CHEER

26:48.000 --> 26:51.000
I was close to not getting it, cos
I was nervous annat, talking pish.

26:51.000 --> 26:54.000
Then the strangest thing happened.

26:54.000 --> 26:56.000
I'm about to leave,
thinking I've humped it

26:56.000 --> 26:58.000
and then I sees he's daein
a crossword,

26:58.000 --> 27:00.000
but he's no finished yet,
he's stuck.

27:00.000 --> 27:03.000
So I lean over and say,
"Three tae finish, eh?

27:03.000 --> 27:06.000
"It's a bastard when that happens.

27:06.000 --> 27:11.000
"So genuine, real, honest.
That one's unfeigned.

27:11.000 --> 27:15.000
"Four doon, nine letters,
hard working is assiduous.

27:15.000 --> 27:19.000
"The last one there,
coolness and composure,

27:19.000 --> 27:21.000
"especially
in a difficult situation.

27:22.000 --> 27:24.000
"Equanimity."

27:24.000 --> 27:28.000
The next thing I know, Gillespie's standing
up and gieing it the welcome aboard.

27:28.000 --> 27:30.000
Ah, that's magic!
Dead chuffed for ye, son.

27:30.000 --> 27:33.000
Aye, really happy for you, Mick.
Oh, you guys are the stars, man.

27:33.000 --> 27:35.000
Youse got me there.

27:35.000 --> 27:39.000
Who knows? Mebbe youse'll be
picking up some medals next year.

27:39.000 --> 27:41.000
If we don't have a hard winter.

27:42.000 --> 27:44.000
Right, Boabby, mair drinks!

27:44.000 --> 27:47.000
Seems like we've all had
a bit of good luck today. Huh!

27:47.000 --> 27:49.000
Where is it you're working, son?

27:49.000 --> 27:51.000
Ach, it's just some daft office job.

27:57.000 --> 27:59.000
How ye getting on, Mick?
Brilliant, Mr Gillespie.

27:59.000 --> 28:01.000
I was climbing the walls
there earlier

28:01.000 --> 28:04.000
cos there was ten fines
to be processed there

28:04.000 --> 28:06.000
and I could only find nine of them.

28:06.000 --> 28:08.000
One of them was missing.

28:08.000 --> 28:11.000
So I've hunted,
and of all the places,

28:11.000 --> 28:14.000
it's in the bin, crumpled up!

28:16.000 --> 28:18.000
Nae luck, Mr Ingram, whoever ye are.

28:18.000 --> 28:21.000
Ha-ha-ha!

28:46.000 --> 28:50.000
I feel bad about dropping Winston
in it with that old parking ticket.

28:50.000 --> 28:53.000
Ach, don't worry, son.
You werenae tae know.

28:53.000 --> 28:54.000
What did he get?

28:55.000 --> 28:58.000
What did you get again, Winston?
100 hours.

29:07.000 --> 29:09.000
Everyone's living these
amazing lives,

29:09.000 --> 29:10.000
and I'm stuck!

29:10.000 --> 29:12.000
It's an illusion.

29:13.000 --> 29:15.000
Adam...? Holly.

29:15.000 --> 29:17.000
How long's...? Oh, years.

29:17.000 --> 29:19.000
