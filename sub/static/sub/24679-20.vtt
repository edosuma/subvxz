the worst criminal offenders are pursued

00:06.139 --> 00:08.642
by the detectives of the Major Case Squad.

Gracias very much, pretty lady.

01:22.316 --> 01:25.593
Penny, where were you last night?

01:25.886 --> 01:28.127
I was home, finishing this for you.

01:28.188 --> 01:29.394
You weren't home.

01:29.456 --> 01:31.060
Are you still following me?

01:31.124 --> 01:33.161
Penny, please, I just want
a chance to explain...

01:33.226 --> 01:36.571
It's impossible, Gregg. Try to understand.

Penny.

01:47.507 --> 01:48.918
Here's your share.

01:52.679 --> 01:54.420
We can go again on Thursday.

01:54.481 --> 01:55.721
Okay.

01:56.149 --> 01:58.789
Oh, and the chip down my dress?

01:59.152 --> 02:00.392
Just playing the part.

02:00.454 --> 02:03.162
Next time, leave the acting
to the drama majors.

02:06.426 --> 02:08.667
Who helped you with this?
Your little Korean hot pot?

02:08.729 --> 02:10.072
Don't call her that.

02:10.130 --> 02:12.337
She worked out the algorithm,
but I did the rest.

02:12.399 --> 02:15.437
Neediness is not an attractive
quality in a man, Gregg.

02:16.603 --> 02:19.083
Neither is the inability to keep a secret.

02:19.373 --> 02:21.319
Now, we agreed, no outside contractors.

02:21.375 --> 02:22.945
I can handle Penny.

02:24.177 --> 02:25.622
Then handle her.

You're busted.

Penny?

03:37.417 --> 03:38.521
Penny!

04:35.175 --> 04:38.247
This is a dog park, Sir. 3 people
walking their dogs found her.

04:38.311 --> 04:39.915
The way she's dressed, she could be working

04:39.980 --> 04:41.960

in the vicinity.

04:42.015 --> 04:43.926

This bar code, is that the Department
of Defense security clearance?

04:54.261 --> 04:57.731
Yeah. Once we saw that, we figured she
might actually be a rocket scientist.

04:57.798 --> 05:01.177
Maybe somebody was after the state
secrets in her pretty head.

05:10.277 --> 05:14.919
Yeah, she's got calluses
here and on her thumb.

05:15.348 --> 05:18.761
Whatever she was doing here, this
was the wrong place to do it.

05:18.819 --> 05:22.130
So the killer was standing in plain sight,

05:22.222 --> 05:24.498
yet, he still took the time to...

05:25.926 --> 05:28.202
to snap every one of her fingers. I...

to make it look like a robbery.

05:33.300 --> 05:35.177
He's either stupid or cocky.

05:35.368 --> 05:37.746
Yeah, or he didn't think we'd be fooled.

KRAY: National security?

05:45.212 --> 05:47.886
Penny's work didn't have
anything to do with that.

05:47.948 --> 05:52.829
She designed predictive systems
for pattern recognition software.

05:52.953 --> 05:53.988
To predict what?

05:54.054 --> 05:56.864
Food procurement for the Quartermaster Corps.

05:57.824 --> 05:59.394
And mess hall supplies.

05:59.459 --> 06:02.997
Yes, we have a grant to
virtualize their procedures.

06:03.063 --> 06:06.567
A grant. Does that mean Miss
Chai was paid for her work?

06:06.633 --> 06:09.113
Oh, a very modest salary.

06:09.402 --> 06:12.315
In fact, she asked me for a raise last month.

06:12.372 --> 06:15.546
She said she needed to get an apartment.

06:15.609 --> 06:17.179
But I had to tell her no.

06:17.244 --> 06:19.053
She got the money somewhere.

06:19.713 --> 06:21.215
She moved out of her dorm,

06:21.281 --> 06:22.988
didn't leave a forwarding address.

06:23.049 --> 06:24.119
Hmm.

06:24.184 --> 06:27.495
Did she always keep her desk

06:27.554 --> 06:30.501
this impersonal?

06:30.557 --> 06:33.197
Just her style. Very guarded.

06:33.360 --> 06:36.273
Was there anybody she
let her guard down with?

06:36.563 --> 06:39.066
She seemed to get along well with Amy.

06:39.232 --> 06:42.839
Amy Wittlin. That's her desk
over there, with the palm tree.

06:43.803 --> 06:45.077

Yeah.

06:48.775 --> 06:52.848
Wow. Okay, uh, who's who?

06:53.780 --> 06:56.488
That's Amy in the green bikini.

06:56.750 --> 07:00.027
Rosalie, she's a junior
in the math department,

07:00.086 --> 07:03.761
and Tomas Ramone, also a math major.

07:03.823 --> 07:07.669
Freeport, Bahamas. The place
to be for math majors.

We're still sorting that out.

07:21.141 --> 07:23.678
EAMES: She was found in Chelsea,
over by the West Side highway.

07:23.743 --> 07:25.381
She was pretty beat up.

07:25.712 --> 07:28.886
Any of you know what she might
have been doing over there?

07:32.319 --> 07:34.060
I'll give you a hint.

07:36.256 --> 07:38.395
A card shoe. We're just fooling around.

07:38.458 --> 07:39.960
Fooling around with cards?

07:40.026 --> 07:43.838
For example, at the casinos at Freeport, hmm?

07:44.464 --> 07:47.445
Play cards, hours on end,

07:47.500 --> 07:51.915
you get calluses on your
forefinger, your thumb.

07:51.972 --> 07:54.316
Like you and Penny.

07:56.343 --> 07:58.516
GOREN: Do you mind if I deal?

08:02.482 --> 08:06.828
I heard that a blackjack deck

08:07.587 --> 08:10.033
has a memory.

08:10.357 --> 08:13.463
GOREN: Keep track of
the cards that are played,

08:13.526 --> 08:16.268
you know the cards that are left.

08:17.831 --> 08:20.835
If you're a math Wiz,
you can work out the odds

08:20.900 --> 08:24.313
of, well... for every hand.

08:25.405 --> 08:28.113
It's a predictive system
of pattern recognition.

08:28.174 --> 08:30.017
That's what they'd call it.

08:30.076 --> 08:31.817
I call it counting cards.

08:34.981 --> 08:38.224
Is that what you were doing
last night? And she got caught?

08:38.618 --> 08:41.188
- They wouldn't...
- Her fingers were broken.

08:41.254 --> 08:43.894
You think somebody was
trying to make a point?

08:50.897 --> 08:53.309
It was this place on West 22nd. This...

08:54.167 --> 08:55.942
This private club.

08:56.469 --> 08:57.971
They came after us.

08:58.772 --> 09:00.479
We got split up.

09:01.107 --> 09:03.383
I thought she'd show up in the morning.

09:04.577 --> 09:07.421
I swear to God, I just thought
they were trying to scare us.

09:07.480 --> 09:09.084

09:11.017 --> 09:12.428
We'll be in touch.

near the clubs last night.

Okay, take it easy.

09:36.342 --> 09:38.618
Ken, look, I don't wanna be a
part of this anymore, okay?

09:38.678 --> 09:40.316
I was doing it for her. But now...

09:40.380 --> 09:41.586
For her?

09:42.749 --> 09:45.559
If I thought that you were doing this
just to get back into her pants,

09:45.618 --> 09:47.655
I wouldn't have brought you
into it in the first place.

09:47.720 --> 09:48.790
I told you...

09:48.855 --> 09:51.859
You and Penny wasn't in the cards.

09:52.759 --> 09:55.706
You'll get other women. Believe me.

09:56.396 --> 10:00.708
Just don't wimp out on us.
Because it's not what you do,

10:01.267 --> 10:03.304
it's what you get done.

still living out of boxes.

(COMPUTER WHIRRING)

10:13.279 --> 10:16.522
Eames, sounds like the hard drive is running.

10:17.617 --> 10:19.927
It could be defragmenting the drive.

10:20.453 --> 10:21.955
Or erasing it.

the battery. Shall we hack?

It's octopus stew.

10:53.186 --> 10:56.190
I did a 6-month tour in South Korea.

10:56.356 --> 10:59.462
They use live octopus. The
tentacles get up your nose.

10:59.526 --> 11:00.834

11:13.072 --> 11:16.349
The erase program's been running
almost 16 and a half hours.

11:17.243 --> 11:20.281
It started after Penny was already dead.

11:21.181 --> 11:23.684
They killed her, then came here.

11:23.850 --> 11:27.024
And the program was set to
overwrite the data 33 times.

11:28.354 --> 11:33.064
Whatever was on her computer, they
wanted it erased beyond recovery.

11:33.326 --> 11:35.499
Probably because it leads back to them.

11:35.562 --> 11:38.702
Too bad for them. They did
a better job erasing her.

11:42.502 --> 11:45.312
Our computer nerds recovered
the last file deleted

11:45.371 --> 11:47.544
before the erase program was activated.

11:47.607 --> 11:50.554
It looks like software
to generate random numbers.

11:50.610 --> 11:53.352
Her professor said it wasn't
part of her defense work.

11:53.413 --> 11:57.088
A random number generator doesn't sound
like something a card counter would use.

11:57.150 --> 11:58.629
She wouldn't.

11:58.685 --> 12:00.995
It's a predictive system, it's her specialty.

12:01.054 --> 12:04.331
It's the kind of software that
she'd write for someone else.

12:04.557 --> 12:06.935
Maybe the same person that she's hiding from.

12:06.993 --> 12:09.530
She's moved out of her dorm into a sublet.

12:09.596 --> 12:11.803
She's been living out of her suitcases.

12:11.864 --> 12:14.242
Lots of photos of her family in Raleigh,

12:14.467 --> 12:17.937
of her at her prom, with her
Korean-American boyfriend.

12:18.238 --> 12:22.084

12:23.643 --> 12:24.951
and none of her friends knew?

12:25.011 --> 12:28.618
Well, maybe she didn't talk the
talk, but she was walking the walk.

12:30.483 --> 12:33.487
She dropped 3 classes the
week before she moved.

12:33.553 --> 12:35.829
One of them, multi-variable calculus,

12:35.888 --> 12:38.129
was a requirement for her major.

12:38.191 --> 12:40.728
If she drops it, she doesn't graduate.

12:41.861 --> 12:44.933
Yeah, but she did drop it.

12:47.200 --> 12:51.171
Penny Chai? I don't know, I might have
been in some of her classes. So what?

12:51.237 --> 12:55.447
No, see, Gregg, you were the
only guy in all 3 classes.

12:55.508 --> 12:57.818
The 3 classes she dropped.

12:58.111 --> 13:01.649
Her super at the sublet
recognized you from a photo.

13:01.881 --> 13:04.418
EAMES: She saw you in front of the building.

13:04.684 --> 13:07.460
What were you doing outside her building?

13:08.254 --> 13:09.528
I was...

13:10.356 --> 13:12.302
I was doing a project with her.

13:12.358 --> 13:14.133
I was waiting for her to get home.

It's legal. It just...

13:30.977 --> 13:32.786
it just increases the odds of winning.

13:32.845 --> 13:34.381
Well, we like that.

13:35.048 --> 13:36.152
How does it work?

13:36.215 --> 13:38.161
This equation here, what's "X"?

13:38.318 --> 13:40.696
It's anything you want, it's a variable.

13:41.054 --> 13:43.159
Oh, okay, um...

13:45.458 --> 13:49.031
"X" times 4 over 12. What's 4?

13:49.829 --> 13:52.708
It's a constant. It's just
a unit of measurement.

13:52.799 --> 13:54.107
- 4 is a unit?
- GREGG: Yes.

13:54.167 --> 13:55.646
- What does it measure?
- Nothing.

13:55.702 --> 13:57.147
It doesn't measure anything.

13:57.203 --> 13:59.513
Look, it's not even finished yet. Okay?

13:59.572 --> 14:02.644
It's not even gonna be finished,
so just leave me alone.

14:09.382 --> 14:10.986
A unit of measurement.

14:11.050 --> 14:13.052
4 of something is a unit.

14:13.519 --> 14:14.862
4 of what?

14:16.055 --> 14:19.434
"X" times 4 divided by 12.

14:21.060 --> 14:23.870
12, what do you think, inches?

14:24.063 --> 14:26.907
A unit of measurement that's 4 inches long.

14:31.604 --> 14:32.981
Of course.

He's usually at Milligan's after 7:00.

14:40.380 --> 14:41.723
Somebody I know?

14:41.781 --> 14:43.988
Somebody my Dad knew.

14:46.686 --> 14:49.758
It could be hands, if this
is what you think it is.

14:50.523 --> 14:53.800
The only unit of measurement
4 inches long is a hand.

14:53.893 --> 14:56.999
Hands are how you measure
horses from hoofs to Withers.

14:58.364 --> 15:00.503
This is about horses.

15:01.401 --> 15:03.381
And this measurement here...

15:03.436 --> 15:06.007
Ah! Eighth of a mile. Furlongs.

15:06.072 --> 15:07.244
The length of the track.

15:07.306 --> 15:08.376
Yes.

15:08.441 --> 15:10.284
And these equations here,

15:10.343 --> 15:12.323
win-loss,

15:12.512 --> 15:15.015
one for the beast, one for the jockey.

15:15.081 --> 15:17.561
Are you the girl he brought to the funeral?

15:17.617 --> 15:21.861
'Cause if I didn't say it
then, you are very lovely.

15:21.954 --> 15:24.628
I didn't bring anyone to the funeral.

15:25.825 --> 15:28.897
This program is for handicapping horse races.

15:29.262 --> 15:30.502
Does it work?

15:30.563 --> 15:33.066
About as well as the system his father used.

15:33.399 --> 15:35.504
He used to check the horses out

15:35.568 --> 15:36.672
in their stalls before the race,

15:36.736 --> 15:40.343
see if their ears were up or
down and bet accordingly.

15:41.607 --> 15:43.587
Well, maybe that's the point of all this.

15:43.643 --> 15:45.987
A gimmick to sell to gamblers?

15:46.045 --> 15:48.855
It has the veneer of logic, doesn't it?

15:49.615 --> 15:51.891
And it factors in every variable.

15:51.951 --> 15:53.862
And does so very elegantly.

15:53.920 --> 15:57.333
If you could use this
for credible justification

15:57.390 --> 15:59.529
of any long shot bet,

16:00.660 --> 16:03.834
even suspicious ones, it would, right, Ferdie?

16:03.896 --> 16:06.934
Yes, it would. It would at that.

16:09.268 --> 16:10.338
(EXCLAIMING)

16:10.403 --> 16:12.713
No playing with Daddy's stuff, Captain.

16:12.772 --> 16:14.752
Come over here with
Uncle Gregg and Uncle Phil.

16:14.807 --> 16:17.117
Ken, please, we need you to focus.

16:17.176 --> 16:18.951
On what? You girls need to cowboy up.

16:19.011 --> 16:21.048
Those cops are shooting in the dark.

16:21.113 --> 16:22.751
GREGG: You don't know what they know.

16:22.815 --> 16:24.021
KEN: So I'll find out.

16:24.083 --> 16:26.825
Guys, it's just a hiccup. Go home.

16:27.019 --> 16:28.123
Okay?

16:28.187 --> 16:30.326
Go to the gym, do something.

16:30.923 --> 16:32.493
And just relax.

16:33.926 --> 16:35.166
(DOOR OPENING)

16:36.696 --> 16:38.141
(DOOR CLOSING)

16:40.833 --> 16:41.971
(SIGHING)

16:42.368 --> 16:45.144
I have to go out later, just for an hour.

16:45.204 --> 16:47.150
I have to cool these guys down.

16:48.708 --> 16:51.882
Maybe they're right. Maybe
this time it's pushing it.

16:55.114 --> 16:56.252
(INAUDIBLE)

17:03.789 --> 17:04.790
(SIGHING)

17:11.497 --> 17:13.339
They ran a full schedule at Del Mar.

17:13.398 --> 17:17.175
You know, we could run the winners
and the losers through the program.

17:21.707 --> 17:23.084
(SIGHING)

17:27.012 --> 17:28.993
Anything missing from your desk?

17:32.418 --> 17:36.764
No, but I don't remember
leaving these files like this.

17:37.123 --> 17:40.127
Well, my notepad's missing the top sheet.

17:42.895 --> 17:46.433
This Post-it was on my
phone, not on my blotter.

17:49.835 --> 17:51.109
You see anyone at my desk?

17:51.170 --> 17:53.207
Yeah. Plain clothes from the 58.

17:53.739 --> 17:57.778
He had a visitor's clip. He was here
when I came on shift an hour ago.

17:57.944 --> 18:00.151
He said you told him to wait for you.

18:00.680 --> 18:02.523
Well, what did he look like?

18:02.582 --> 18:04.562
Caucasian, average height,

18:04.617 --> 18:08.064
hat, puffy coat, tinted glasses and a scarf.

18:08.421 --> 18:11.800
He skimmed these folders but he
read the one on Penelope Chai.

18:12.925 --> 18:16.668
I clipped the autopsy report
to my notes on Tomas Ramone.

18:16.829 --> 18:18.240
He moved the clip.

18:18.431 --> 18:20.377
He wanted to know what we have.

18:21.934 --> 18:25.746
Yeah, he entered the lion's den.

18:26.539 --> 18:27.574
Bold.

18:27.640 --> 18:29.176
He's out of his mind.

18:30.943 --> 18:34.413
No, it's worse. He doesn't know fear.

18:40.453 --> 18:43.127
He signed in using ID stolen from a messenger.

18:43.189 --> 18:45.032
He came in during the shift change.

18:45.091 --> 18:48.197
So nobody paid any attention.
These are useless.

18:48.260 --> 18:50.570
Either his head's down or he's turned away.

18:50.630 --> 18:53.236
He came in with the vaguest of
plans and then he winged it.

18:53.299 --> 18:55.609
He's smart, he adapts.

18:56.202 --> 18:58.045
He's dancing on a high wire.

18:58.270 --> 19:00.546
GOREN: If there's a leader
in this scam, he's it.

19:00.606 --> 19:03.519
So now, everything we know
about the scam, he knows.

19:03.576 --> 19:05.021
GOREN: Well, he doesn't know we know this.

19:05.077 --> 19:06.852
You fix a race, one way to get caught

19:06.912 --> 19:08.619
is to put a heavy bet on a long shot winner.

19:08.681 --> 19:11.287
And the racing board will want to
know why you bet on that horse.

19:11.350 --> 19:12.988
GOREN: This program will give him an answer.

19:13.052 --> 19:14.292
I fix a race,

19:14.387 --> 19:17.300
I put every variable about
my horse in the program.

19:17.356 --> 19:19.768
I do the same thing with
every horse in every race.

19:19.825 --> 19:24.035
The program uses a combination
of my winning horse's variables

19:24.497 --> 19:27.239
to pick horses in other races
for me to bet on.

19:27.299 --> 19:29.074
If anybody questions your winning bet,

19:29.135 --> 19:31.877
you can point to your other bets
and your handicapping system.

19:31.937 --> 19:34.349
It turns my long shot winner

19:34.407 --> 19:37.354
into some lucky pick by
a sucker with a system.

19:38.711 --> 19:39.951
It's a smoke screen.

19:40.012 --> 19:44.051
Now we just need to pick out the
sucker who's been using this system.

19:44.283 --> 19:46.388
This program was created two weeks ago,

19:46.452 --> 19:49.228
which means running two weeks'
worth of racing results

19:49.288 --> 19:50.790
through the program.

19:51.724 --> 19:54.364
Can't be too tough for the State Racing Board.

19:57.396 --> 19:59.706
KEN: That's right. I made the
bet last Saturday afternoon

19:59.765 --> 20:01.574
at the OTB on Queens Boulevard.

20:01.634 --> 20:04.240
We're investigating muggings
of OTB customers there.

20:04.303 --> 20:05.782
Well, if I'd seen anyone get mugged,

20:05.838 --> 20:08.512
you're the first people I
would've called. How did you...

20:08.574 --> 20:12.044
Through the tax form you filled out
when you collected your winnings.

20:12.111 --> 20:14.614
That was a real red-letter day for you, huh?

20:15.147 --> 20:18.094
Winning $10,000 on that long shot bet.

20:18.818 --> 20:20.092
I got lucky.

20:20.352 --> 20:22.161
You know, I heard

20:23.489 --> 20:27.403
that people that play the ponies a
lot, they develop their own system.

20:28.728 --> 20:30.207
I don't play a lot.

20:30.763 --> 20:33.300
- KEN: Sorry. You need a hand?
- EAMES: I don't.

20:34.667 --> 20:35.941
Thanks.

20:36.001 --> 20:37.674
My partner's the mountain goat.

20:37.737 --> 20:39.842
I have a little problem with heights.

20:39.905 --> 20:40.975
How about you?

20:41.040 --> 20:43.179
My mother's father was Mohawk.

20:43.275 --> 20:46.722
He used to tell stories about working
high steel. It sounded like fun.

20:46.779 --> 20:48.156
So you became an engineer?

20:48.214 --> 20:49.454
Where'd you get your degree?

20:49.515 --> 20:51.119
Hudson. Two years ago.

20:51.383 --> 20:54.728
What's that frat for engineers?
Engineers, mathematicians?

20:55.154 --> 20:56.497
Alpha Beta Pi.

20:56.555 --> 20:58.501
That's the one. You a brother?

20:58.557 --> 21:00.298
I joined for the keggers.

21:00.993 --> 21:02.370
Watch your step.

21:04.096 --> 21:07.509
- Just don't look down.
- Yeah, easy for you to say.

21:08.501 --> 21:09.980
You know, I can't...

21:10.102 --> 21:14.847
I just can't stop thinking
about that long shot bet, Ken.

21:16.308 --> 21:18.049
Walking in off the street,

21:18.778 --> 21:20.758
hitting a 16-to-one long shot.

21:20.813 --> 21:23.293
Yeah, you're right.

21:23.616 --> 21:26.597
Last week, I heard one of the subs
talking, he knew a guy who knew a guy,

21:26.652 --> 21:28.222
so I bet the horse.

21:29.522 --> 21:32.833
Is there something wrong with
your jaw? I saw you working it.

21:33.959 --> 21:37.338
I popped an eardrum, cave
diving off Maui last year.

21:37.429 --> 21:39.602
Cave diving. Not in a million years.

21:39.765 --> 21:41.540
One wrong move and you're fish bait.

21:41.600 --> 21:43.807
That's the attraction, isn't it, Ken?

21:44.470 --> 21:46.472
You just have to keep your cool.

21:49.008 --> 21:50.385
Testing yourself.

21:51.644 --> 21:53.351
And that's why you're...

21:53.579 --> 21:56.389
you're up here instead of in the
office, with the real engineers.

21:56.448 --> 21:57.552
(LAUGHING)

21:57.817 --> 22:00.855
I like being in the arena,
making things happen.

22:01.787 --> 22:04.165
Yeah, thinking on your feet. Otherwise, what?

22:04.223 --> 22:05.930
You get restless?

22:12.231 --> 22:13.710
You see, I see now.

22:16.569 --> 22:19.049
You have a reduced startle response.

22:21.106 --> 22:22.983
I mean, most people, when they

22:24.710 --> 22:28.487
almost take a header off a
building, you know, they...

22:30.149 --> 22:31.560
For me, example.

22:32.184 --> 22:33.891
They get scared.

22:34.253 --> 22:37.063
Their eyes open wide, they blink big.

22:37.823 --> 22:41.635
It's called an increase in blink
magnitude. But you, not you, you know.

22:42.428 --> 22:44.374
No, it didn't bother you a bit.

22:46.732 --> 22:49.906
You panic, you die.

22:52.738 --> 22:53.842
Yeah.

22:56.642 --> 23:00.215
Harris has no known association
with gambling syndicates.

23:00.579 --> 23:04.686
Closest he's been to horses is taking
his son for a pony ride to the zoo.

23:05.351 --> 23:08.127
He went to the same school as
Gregg Monroe and Penny Chai.

23:08.187 --> 23:12.499
He was in the same frat. His bets
conformed to the computer program.

23:12.625 --> 23:16.300
Can't Harris just be a young
engineer who made a lucky bet?

23:17.329 --> 23:20.708
A young engineer with
no discernible fear response.

23:23.002 --> 23:27.382
People like him, they become
firefighters, race car drivers,

23:28.207 --> 23:31.245
or tweak the upbringing another way,

23:32.278 --> 23:33.655
they become psychopaths.

23:33.712 --> 23:35.157
Which way did Harris get tweaked?

23:35.214 --> 23:37.387
At Hudson, he was a member
of the skydiving club,

23:37.449 --> 23:38.951
he's been a volunteer firefighter...

23:39.018 --> 23:40.292
Definitely a miscreant.

23:40.352 --> 23:43.162
On the other hand, his DMV records

23:43.455 --> 23:46.265
show 3 speeding tickets from high school.

23:47.226 --> 23:51.197
Two of which he was going 80 miles
an hour in a 35-mile-an-hour zone.

23:53.799 --> 23:56.279
Look, he has what it took

23:57.269 --> 23:59.647
to sneak into this building.

23:59.705 --> 24:01.685
It's very thin, people.

24:02.241 --> 24:06.917
Let me know when you have something
that sticks to the spoon.

24:11.650 --> 24:13.152
A couple of clowns.

24:13.218 --> 24:15.528
Especially the big guy. I can't
believe they rattled you.

24:15.587 --> 24:18.431
They're not clowns. They
found you, didn't they?

24:18.490 --> 24:21.664
Time to bail. We made $10,000, that's cool.

24:21.727 --> 24:25.504
That's cool? Remind me again how deep
you are in the hole, Mr. Dotcom.

24:25.564 --> 24:27.043
$250,000?

24:27.399 --> 24:29.276
How're you gonna make the
bets? The cops know you.

24:29.335 --> 24:31.747
They don't know you. That's what matters.

24:31.804 --> 24:33.408
Let me worry about putting the bets down.

24:33.472 --> 24:35.543
You never worry. You don't worry about us,

24:35.607 --> 24:39.020
you don't worry about Penny getting
killed. Why is that, Ken?

24:43.916 --> 24:45.452
You got something to say, Gregg?

24:45.517 --> 24:47.929
Say it to those cops. Right
there in that building there.

24:47.987 --> 24:49.625
Eleventh floor. Goren and Eames. Go ahead.

24:49.688 --> 24:52.328
PHIL: Nobody's going to the police, Kenny.

24:52.424 --> 24:55.735
If you do, have the freaking
decency to give me a head start.

24:56.495 --> 24:58.031
Talk to you tomorrow.

25:05.070 --> 25:06.674
I'm scared too, Kenny.

25:08.140 --> 25:10.848
Sometimes I wish you could
feel what it's like.

25:11.710 --> 25:12.848
But I don't.

25:15.014 --> 25:17.893
The only way I can do this
is if you believe in me.

25:19.318 --> 25:22.891
Now, just let me get through this one thing,

25:23.455 --> 25:25.526
then I'll hang it up. Okay?

25:29.895 --> 25:32.466
The racing board reeled him in this morning.

25:32.664 --> 25:35.304
He made a series of bets on
his credit card two days ago

25:35.367 --> 25:38.177
that lined him up with the computer program.

25:38.237 --> 25:40.148
This is Mr. Cooley of the State Board.

25:40.205 --> 25:41.650
(PHONE RINGING)

25:43.008 --> 25:44.282
- GOREN: Hey.
- Hi.

25:45.477 --> 25:46.888
And that's Bannerman?

25:46.945 --> 25:49.619
He was in promotions
at Aqueduct until last year,

25:49.681 --> 25:53.595
when a security check showed he'd run
up over $300,000 in gambling debts.

25:53.685 --> 25:55.756
He knows jockeys, trainers.

25:55.821 --> 25:57.300
He's ready to talk.

25:59.792 --> 26:01.499
I fixed a race at Belmont

26:01.727 --> 26:05.675
and I used this computer
program to make it look legit.

26:06.398 --> 26:07.468
That's it.

26:07.533 --> 26:08.807
EAMES: How'd you fix the race?

26:08.867 --> 26:12.144
No, no, no. That comes later
after we hammer out a deal.

26:12.237 --> 26:15.810
Well, can he at least tell us where
he found the computer program?

26:15.974 --> 26:18.853
From this Oriental chick
I met in Atlantic City.

26:19.545 --> 26:22.287
I noticed her counting cards in a casino.

26:22.981 --> 26:24.688
I threatened to turn her in

26:24.750 --> 26:28.892
unless she would, you
know, come up to my room.

26:29.788 --> 26:31.790
I told her about my
association with racing

26:31.857 --> 26:34.565
and she told me she was working
on this betting program.

26:34.626 --> 26:36.469
We decided to work together.

26:37.229 --> 26:40.642
But as soon as I got the program
from her, I didn't need her.

26:46.205 --> 26:47.275
(STAMMERS)

26:48.707 --> 26:49.947
Penny,

26:51.510 --> 26:55.356
she had a very thick Korean accent and...

26:56.582 --> 26:58.892
Did you have trouble understanding her?

26:59.618 --> 27:03.259
Yeah, at first, but I got used to it.

27:05.991 --> 27:10.633
We'll discuss your offer and
we'll get back to you next week.

27:10.796 --> 27:13.538
CARVER: Next week? We can resolve this today.

27:13.999 --> 27:17.640
KASTNER: No, I'm going to the islands
tomorrow. I'll be back Tuesday.

27:17.703 --> 27:19.410
We'll let you know then.

27:22.107 --> 27:24.280
Bannerman's a diversion.
He never met Penny Chai.

27:24.343 --> 27:25.754
They threw him at us to buy time.

27:25.811 --> 27:28.485
Harris and Monroe? Awfully
sophisticated for a couple of frat boys.

27:28.547 --> 27:29.651
Got him.

27:29.715 --> 27:31.820
A list of Kastner's past clients.

27:35.087 --> 27:37.363
GOREN: All members of the Israeli mob.

27:37.523 --> 27:39.730
Bannerman's probably in hock to them.

27:40.058 --> 27:43.562
Playing patsy to... that's his
way of paying off his debt.

27:44.029 --> 27:46.168
The Israeli mob's behind this scam?

27:47.466 --> 27:48.774
They are now.

27:50.903 --> 27:53.110
Ken Harris felt us closing in on him.

27:54.173 --> 27:55.914
The normal man would quit.

27:56.241 --> 27:57.515
Not him.

27:57.976 --> 28:01.253
No, instead he partners up with the
most vicious criminals he can find,

28:01.313 --> 28:03.156
raising the stakes because...

28:03.982 --> 28:05.723
Well, it's his nature.

28:09.555 --> 28:12.263
Bannerman charged his bets
on his credit card, right?

28:12.324 --> 28:16.295
Using a dial-up account at an OTB office.

28:16.528 --> 28:18.769
Now, how did Harris make his bets?

28:18.830 --> 28:20.867
Credit card, doesn't say which one.

28:20.933 --> 28:22.571
GOREN: Well, we need the actual charge.

28:22.634 --> 28:25.547
Check his credit card report to find the card.

28:28.607 --> 28:32.419
His credit's good, just the usual
credit inquiries from a car dealership,

28:32.477 --> 28:35.287
department stores, an
insurance company last week.

28:36.081 --> 28:39.619
Here, 3 credit cards. I'll try
the one with the higher limit.

28:40.118 --> 28:41.495
- What?
- Here we go.

28:41.887 --> 28:44.265
$500 at the OTB last week.

28:44.823 --> 28:48.862
This charge is credited to Totalizer Inc.

28:52.030 --> 28:54.476
That's the same as Bannerman's charge.

28:56.535 --> 29:00.950
It must be a company for processing
dial-up betting accounts.

29:03.208 --> 29:05.711
Well, you have two bites at fixing a race.

29:06.745 --> 29:09.589
Before it's run and you know, right after.

29:09.648 --> 29:13.289
You can't change the results, but
maybe you can change the bets.

29:16.054 --> 29:20.594
And I'll bet that we'll find
a frat brother at Totalizer.

29:23.629 --> 29:26.940
Where is he? I got a text-message
to meet him here.

29:27.032 --> 29:29.069
He's probably putting his kid to sleep.

29:29.134 --> 29:30.943
So, big day tomorrow.

29:32.304 --> 29:34.716
How you doing, huh? You
mind if I take a load off?

29:34.773 --> 29:36.946
Hey, what're you frat boys drinking?

29:37.442 --> 29:41.288
That's okay, Detective Goren,
we were just leaving.

29:41.346 --> 29:44.384
This seat taken? How you
doing, Phil? Alex Eames.

29:44.449 --> 29:45.587
Hi.

29:45.651 --> 29:48.894
Oh, and don't worry about Ken.
We sent you those messages.

29:48.954 --> 29:50.024
Yeah.

29:50.088 --> 29:52.398
We wanted to meet the real
brains behind the operation.

29:52.457 --> 29:53.834
Especially you, Phil.

29:53.892 --> 29:58.363
The man who found the flaw in the way
Totalizer processes dial-up bets.

29:58.430 --> 30:01.070
They told us they don't
process the dial-up bets

30:01.133 --> 30:03.773
until the first 4 races of the day are run.

30:03.835 --> 30:08.306
Which means that someone working
in data security at Totalizer

30:08.373 --> 30:10.876
could change the bets of those 4 races.

30:11.877 --> 30:14.517
You know, change losing
bets into winning bets.

30:15.280 --> 30:17.419
Kind of like waving a wand.

30:17.582 --> 30:21.291
(STUTTERING) I'm not the only person in
data security, okay?

30:21.353 --> 30:23.299
You can't put this on me.

30:23.955 --> 30:27.459
You covered yourself really good, Phil.

30:28.360 --> 30:31.068
You really did. You have
nothing to worry about.

30:31.530 --> 30:34.033
Especially from us. I mean, nothing at all.

30:34.433 --> 30:36.276
You wanna know Ken's secret?

30:38.236 --> 30:41.115
He's incapable of experiencing fear

30:42.040 --> 30:43.678
and well, that means...

30:44.943 --> 30:46.581
It means he's a menace.

30:49.214 --> 30:52.127
Especially with people that
he gets into business with,

30:52.184 --> 30:53.891
you know, people like you two.

30:53.952 --> 30:55.932
Have you met Ken's new partners?

30:57.789 --> 30:59.496
This is Ralph Bannerman.

31:01.026 --> 31:03.563
Bannerman's lawyer, Frank Kastner,

31:04.463 --> 31:07.273
a few of Mr. Kastner's regular clients.

31:07.532 --> 31:10.012
Bookmaker, bookmaker,

31:10.369 --> 31:11.541
leg-breaker,

31:11.670 --> 31:14.617
murderer, another leg-breaker,

31:15.006 --> 31:17.509
and they're all members of the Israeli mob.

31:17.976 --> 31:21.856
They're Ken's new partners. Which
means, they're your new partners, too.

31:24.716 --> 31:26.195
He didn't tell you?

31:26.651 --> 31:28.961
Boy, that Ken. He's just
full of surprises, isn't he?

31:29.020 --> 31:31.557
You know, there's another surprise
that he kept from you, Gregg?

31:31.623 --> 31:35.537
Somebody tried to erase the random
numbers program from Penny's computer.

31:35.861 --> 31:37.738
After she was killed.

31:38.263 --> 31:42.541
Who else, besides you, knew that
Penny helped you write that program?

31:50.041 --> 31:51.349
Ken killed her.

31:53.945 --> 31:58.394
And now he's on the way to
getting the both of you killed.

32:01.553 --> 32:04.056
It's up to you, if he'll succeed.

32:09.194 --> 32:10.195
Right.

32:10.729 --> 32:14.142
That's 10 groups of 8 picks,
6 tickets on the Orlando Derby.

32:14.199 --> 32:15.701
Total, $160,000.

32:16.701 --> 32:17.975
No, thank you.

32:20.372 --> 32:24.149
Now we send my buddy the confirmation
numbers, we let him do the rest.

32:24.209 --> 32:25.449
Trust me.

32:25.510 --> 32:27.251
We can't lose if we tried.

32:29.948 --> 32:31.552
(BEEPING)

32:34.986 --> 32:36.363
(SIGHING)

32:38.757 --> 32:41.601
(MAN CHATTERING ON P.A.)

32:44.596 --> 32:46.542
3 winners across the board.

32:49.534 --> 32:52.378
I'm not showing a win
on these confirmation codes.

32:56.174 --> 32:57.278
That can't be right.

32:57.342 --> 32:59.879
We got 8 picks, 6 winners in each group.

32:59.945 --> 33:02.084
I'm looking at your bets right here.

33:02.147 --> 33:03.285
No winners.

33:04.216 --> 33:05.718
CASHIER: Sorry, son.

33:07.886 --> 33:09.490
Let's talk outside.

33:11.890 --> 33:14.234
Let me get in touch with my guy.
We can figure this out.

33:14.292 --> 33:16.966
I figured out you just cost me $160,000...

33:17.028 --> 33:18.132
Excuse me.

33:18.597 --> 33:20.736
We need to borrow your friend here.

33:22.200 --> 33:23.406
(CHUCKLES)

33:23.468 --> 33:25.106
Hey, come on, guys.

33:25.770 --> 33:27.249
It's only for a couple of hours.

33:27.305 --> 33:29.717
You can catch up to him later, all right?

33:35.614 --> 33:38.117
My wife and kid. If those
guys think I cheated them...

33:38.183 --> 33:39.719
There's no "if", Ken.

33:43.822 --> 33:45.733
Mrs. Harris, we're with the police.

33:45.790 --> 33:47.701
Oh, my God, Ken. Has something happened?

33:47.759 --> 33:49.033
GOREN: He's been arrested.

33:49.094 --> 33:51.665
You need to come down to the station with us.

33:51.930 --> 33:53.273
(SIGHING)

33:55.667 --> 33:57.010
I'll get my son.

34:00.171 --> 34:02.777
It figures. Those two wusses
would make me the fall guy.

34:02.841 --> 34:05.014
I thought I was making legitimate bets.

34:05.076 --> 34:07.955
I had no idea Phil and Gregg
had rigged the system.

34:08.580 --> 34:11.288
And your little scam
with your Israeli friends?

34:11.349 --> 34:13.295
They didn't look happy you ripped them off.

34:13.351 --> 34:16.059
All I have to say about that
is, you people set me up.

34:16.121 --> 34:19.261
Really hung my ass in the
breeze. But that's okay.

34:19.324 --> 34:21.326
I'm in here with you. They're out there.

34:21.393 --> 34:23.896
Well, that's good short-term thinking, Ken.

34:25.330 --> 34:27.936
You're charged with one
count of betting fraud.

34:27.998 --> 34:29.306
A "D" felony.

34:31.069 --> 34:33.275
I can have you arraigned by 2:00.

34:33.438 --> 34:36.476
I can agree to your release
by your own recognizance

34:36.541 --> 34:38.918
and have you on the street lickety-split.

34:38.976 --> 34:42.356
With no chance of making it to
the subway station in one piece.

34:42.447 --> 34:46.452
Or you can plead guilty to
the murder of Penelope Chai

34:46.551 --> 34:48.428
and serve your time in isolation,

34:48.485 --> 34:51.399
under the protection of the
Department of Correction.

34:51.456 --> 34:53.163
I like Plan A better.

34:53.625 --> 34:55.400
Plan A is a death sentence.

34:55.760 --> 34:57.603
I'm not afraid of the Israelis.

34:57.662 --> 35:00.404
Believe me, I've been in hairier situations.

35:00.966 --> 35:02.206
Cave off of Maui.

35:02.267 --> 35:07.012
That's a walk in the park. I once had a
parachute pack refuse to open at 15,000 feet.

35:07.072 --> 35:10.417
I opened it with a pen
knife, 3,000 feet to spare.

35:10.775 --> 35:12.379
Don't you get scared?

35:13.244 --> 35:15.315
You know, like most people?

35:16.748 --> 35:17.886
You know...

35:19.884 --> 35:22.057
I mean, you don't get scared at all?

35:23.622 --> 35:25.124
GOREN: I wonder why?

35:25.690 --> 35:26.862
It's a gift.

35:28.326 --> 35:31.170
It allows me to push myself
harder than other people.

35:31.229 --> 35:35.302
You can always trick yourself into
believing that you're invincible.

35:35.867 --> 35:39.178
If somebody tags me with a laser
sight, I'm gonna keep going.

35:43.408 --> 35:45.046
Your wife, Kerry,

35:47.879 --> 35:50.018
is that why she's attracted to you?

35:51.149 --> 35:53.686
Because of your self-confidence?

35:53.785 --> 35:55.423
You'll have to ask her.

35:55.787 --> 35:57.289
I'll tell you this,

35:58.556 --> 36:01.298
she's the reason I get
out of bed in the morning.

36:05.630 --> 36:07.405
She's my prayer warrior.

36:11.369 --> 36:13.645
She believes in you. It's important.

36:14.339 --> 36:16.444
She knows I'll never let her down.

36:19.811 --> 36:21.757
You wanna know how she's doing?

36:23.014 --> 36:24.652
Cause we can...

36:24.983 --> 36:26.724
(CLEARING THROAT)
Come on.

36:29.521 --> 36:32.365
Your son's watching cartoons
with a social worker.

36:34.959 --> 36:38.133
Why is Kerry in that room? She doesn't
have anything to do with anything.

36:38.196 --> 36:39.231
I wanna talk to her.

36:39.297 --> 36:42.437
Since you're under arrest,
Mr. Harris, I can't allow it.

36:43.735 --> 36:46.579
But I can see her. I'm allowed to talk to her.

36:50.008 --> 36:52.750
If there's anything that
you need to say to her,

36:53.478 --> 36:55.685
you know, give her your love or...

37:01.653 --> 37:03.496
How's my husband? When can I see him?

37:03.555 --> 37:06.092
GOREN: It shouldn't be much longer.

37:06.157 --> 37:08.535
Your son's really liking those cartoons.

37:09.094 --> 37:11.199
He's a very active child.

37:13.898 --> 37:17.402
Just like his Dad, huh?
With all that scuba diving,

37:17.469 --> 37:19.073
jumping out of planes.

37:19.671 --> 37:21.275
It's a thrill a minute.

37:22.741 --> 37:24.880
He trained hard to do those things.

37:27.178 --> 37:29.351
Kid stays with you. That's smart.

37:30.181 --> 37:31.888
Anything happens to Kenny,

37:32.016 --> 37:34.496
his parachute doesn't open
or he runs out of...

37:34.552 --> 37:36.361
He can take care of himself.

37:38.690 --> 37:42.331
How long have you been together?

37:43.962 --> 37:45.373
Since high school.

37:46.998 --> 37:50.639
Those must've been exciting years for you.

37:51.336 --> 37:52.781
We had a lot of fun.

37:52.837 --> 37:57.718
Were you with him when he
got those speeding tickets

37:59.511 --> 38:02.458
going 80 miles an hour
in a 35-mile-an-hour zone?

38:04.482 --> 38:05.961
Was that fun?

38:06.851 --> 38:09.695
You told him to slow down, didn't you?

38:11.689 --> 38:12.963
But he didn't.

38:14.959 --> 38:16.700
He wasn't scared?

38:17.362 --> 38:18.932
He never gets scared?

38:20.799 --> 38:23.040
Do you ever wonder why he can't sit still,

38:23.101 --> 38:27.174
why he's always looking for stimulation?

38:27.238 --> 38:29.115
He's not always like that.

38:29.774 --> 38:34.154
GOREN: According to his boss,
he's disruptive, he plays people.

38:34.879 --> 38:36.256
Do you ever see him do that?

38:36.314 --> 38:38.954
- KERRY: No. People like Ken.
- GOREN: He's manipulative.

38:42.787 --> 38:46.496
He has a high tolerance for fear stimuli.

38:47.759 --> 38:49.864
Do you understand what that means?

38:52.931 --> 38:56.276
He has all the traits of
a certain personality type.

39:01.139 --> 39:03.517
It's this type.

39:05.577 --> 39:06.749
Here.

39:11.049 --> 39:12.960
Psychopathic personality.

39:19.490 --> 39:21.231
- This isn't Ken.
- No?

39:21.292 --> 39:23.431
He knows he has to change.

39:25.563 --> 39:28.669
Well, there's knowing, and there's doing.

39:28.733 --> 39:29.973
He can do it.

39:30.368 --> 39:31.642
She knows it.

39:33.171 --> 39:34.707
You don't believe that.

39:34.772 --> 39:36.217
Yeah, I do.

39:36.274 --> 39:37.378
Kerry.

39:37.942 --> 39:40.786
You know what kind of man
you hitched your wagon to.

39:40.845 --> 39:42.620
You know that he's not gonna change.

39:42.680 --> 39:45.718
His fearlessness, this gift, it's a curse.

39:46.251 --> 39:47.753
You know it's gonna get him killed.

39:47.819 --> 39:49.127
No, it's...

39:49.187 --> 39:51.360
Look, when you opened the door this afternoon,

39:51.422 --> 39:53.333
I saw what you were thinking.

39:53.591 --> 39:55.969
- Kenny's dead.
- No, I didn't think that.

39:56.094 --> 39:58.096
Kenny's not gonna die.

40:04.502 --> 40:07.415
Well, maybe you can explain this.

40:10.842 --> 40:14.984
We saw this inquiry on Kenny's credit
reports from Colonial Trust Insurance.

40:15.747 --> 40:19.490
They own Kenny's insurance policy, right?

40:20.752 --> 40:25.667
Last week, you increased the benefit
from $200,000 to $2,000,000,

40:28.226 --> 40:30.297
and Kenny doesn't know, does he?

40:32.931 --> 40:34.911
You want to grow old with him.

40:34.966 --> 40:36.536
(SOBBING)

40:36.834 --> 40:39.872
You want your son to have a father.

40:44.242 --> 40:46.222
But you looked at the odds,

40:49.547 --> 40:52.255
and you're betting that
he ain't gonna make it.

40:58.222 --> 41:00.759
(CRYING)
What am I supposed to do?

41:04.662 --> 41:06.938
He thinks he can't get hurt!

41:07.665 --> 41:09.372
And he won't stop!

41:09.834 --> 41:11.643
He just won't stop!

41:33.191 --> 41:35.296
Well, there's your prayer warrior.

41:35.893 --> 41:40.342
The woman who loved me, who had faith in me.

41:42.567 --> 41:45.207
As far as she's concerned, your race is run.

41:48.206 --> 41:50.652
GOREN: Now, if you can't even
make her believe you anymore...

41:50.708 --> 41:52.551
What chance do I really have?

41:59.650 --> 42:00.890
You're...

42:01.953 --> 42:03.557
You're feeling it now.

42:05.857 --> 42:07.495
It's searching you out.

42:09.160 --> 42:10.400
Laser sight.

42:12.530 --> 42:14.066
I gotta run the odds.

42:14.499 --> 42:15.910
I gotta be quick about it.

42:15.967 --> 42:18.038
How much time do I have?

42:18.369 --> 42:20.679
How much time before it hits the...

42:29.480 --> 42:31.460
Now do we have your attention?

42:36.988 --> 42:38.433
I'll take the deal.

42:40.291 --> 42:42.430
You'll plead to Miss Chai's murder?

42:45.696 --> 42:46.834
Yes.

42:50.034 --> 42:51.411
I want protection.

42:52.236 --> 42:53.977
For your wife and child?

42:56.674 --> 42:57.948
For me.

43:02.580 --> 43:06.392
Wow. Will wonders never cease? He blinked.

43:07.518 --> 43:09.259
He may be human after all.

43:11.722 --> 43:12.996
Optimist.

43:14.926 --> 43:16.371
