WEBVTT

00:13.180 --> 00:15.681
<i>Okay, welcome back. Last week
we were talking about</i>

00:15.683 --> 00:19.351
<i>some of the stuff that you are
fed from the time you were born</i>

00:19.353 --> 00:23.889
<i>and the, the facts that we accept
as facts and we never stop and go.</i>

00:23.891 --> 00:26.825
Wait a second,
um, is that true?

00:26.827 --> 00:29.294
We never stop and try to think
outside the box

00:29.296 --> 00:31.864
and try to live our lives
as free thinkers.

00:31.866 --> 00:35.234
We're living our lives
as programmed robots.

00:35.236 --> 00:38.070
Uh, I know, it's a little
dramatic, but it's true, too.

00:38.072 --> 00:41.206
How often do you stop and
question the things around you

00:41.208 --> 00:43.375
and just try to think outside
the box?

00:43.377 --> 00:48.080
Um, so, uh, jumping back into
Hollow Earth Theory.

00:48.082 --> 00:53.719
1692, an astronomer named Edmond
Halley says the Earth is hollow.

00:53.721 --> 00:55.421
Wow! It is?

00:55.423 --> 00:57.189
<i>Yes, it is. It may, in fact..</i>

00:57.191 --> 00:58.357
Huh.

00:58.359 --> 01:00.826
<i>Oh, look at that.
Nice old guitar.</i>

01:00.828 --> 01:04.129
Yes, it's just been sitting in
my uncle's attic collecting dust.

01:04.131 --> 01:05.765
I clean it up a little bit.
I mean, it looks good.

01:05.766 --> 01:08.100
- It's got, like, a little..
<i>- Yeah. Yeah.</i>

01:08.102 --> 01:10.270
<i>- Minor..
- Yeah, I mean, it's a.. You know, it's in good shape.</i>

01:10.271 --> 01:13.705
<i>- It's an antique.
- It is an antique. It's a Silvertone guitar.</i>

01:13.707 --> 01:17.876
This was a, a sort of a cheap
guitar back when they were around.

01:17.878 --> 01:19.779
Almost a department-store
guitar. Like a Kay guitar.

01:19.780 --> 01:22.314
- Really?
- You know, a Kay guitar? They sell 'em at Sears.

01:22.316 --> 01:25.818
- Oh. Really?
- So, yeah. I mean, it's in, it's in pretty good shape.

01:25.820 --> 01:28.521
I always bragged about this guitar.
But it was just a.. I thought it was..

01:28.522 --> 01:30.190
Well, you know, it doesn't, it
doesn't have to be

01:30.191 --> 01:33.258
a great guitar for someone to have
a an amazing relationship with it.

01:33.260 --> 01:34.594
- Do you know what I mean?
- I guess, yeah.

01:34.595 --> 01:37.996
So given that it was not ever
an expensive guitar

01:37.998 --> 01:41.100
though it's aged okay.
Uh, it's not..

01:41.102 --> 01:44.269
It's a niche market, you know? I mean,
I have to find a buyer for this guitar.

01:44.271 --> 01:45.804
- Mm-hmm.
- What do you got in here?

01:45.806 --> 01:48.006
- I have some brand-new boots.
- Oh. Actually..

01:48.008 --> 01:51.577
- From.. Made, hand-made in Mexico.
- Boots in the boot-box.

01:51.579 --> 01:53.079
Yeah. They're like.. I think they're
lizard skin or something. Yeah.

01:53.080 --> 01:54.347
These are nice.
That's a good brand.

01:54.348 --> 01:58.283
Yeah. Yeah. Oh! Nope.
Not quite brand new. Huh?

01:58.285 --> 01:59.418
I tried 'em on.

02:01.722 --> 02:06.558
- Hey.
- Ah-a-hah!

02:06.560 --> 02:10.195
Hey.
Hey. Hey!

02:10.197 --> 02:13.465
Oh. Yeah. Oh, shit!
Just.. I was..

02:13.467 --> 02:15.033
- I got a customer.
- Yeah.

02:15.035 --> 02:17.437
I mean, I mean, I know you got
the earphones in, but you know,

02:17.438 --> 02:21.440
your mouth still makes
the noises.

02:21.442 --> 02:23.108
- Sorry. I'm sorry.
- That's..

02:23.110 --> 02:26.979
He's got a problem.
Okay. So..

02:26.981 --> 02:30.616
I can give you, let's say..

02:30.618 --> 02:34.453
How about a 100 bucks
for both of 'em?

02:34.455 --> 02:36.289
- It's a good price. We're the, we're..
- Yeah?

02:36.290 --> 02:38.791
You're gonna try to sell this by yourself?
What are you gonna do with these boots?

02:38.792 --> 02:41.161
- Yeah.
- They, they.. I mean, they're nice, but they were used.

02:41.162 --> 02:42.895
- You need the money, right?
- Yeah. Yeah.

02:42.897 --> 02:45.130
- What do you say?
- Okay. Yeah. I mean..

02:45.132 --> 02:48.867
Yeah. There you go. Hundred dollars richer.
Hold on. Let's just do our paperwork.

02:48.869 --> 02:52.472
Can you give me your driver's license? I'll give
it to the kid to see if he can do some work.

02:52.473 --> 02:54.907
Yeah. Sure.

02:54.909 --> 02:56.742
Thank you. Hey.

02:56.744 --> 02:57.809
Oh.

03:02.616 --> 03:04.550
You just sign that top X here?

03:04.552 --> 03:05.617
Mm-hmm.

03:10.124 --> 03:11.423
You're not screwing me?

03:11.425 --> 03:12.658
- I'm not screwing you.
- Okay.

03:12.660 --> 03:13.725
<i>- Ben.</i>
- I trust you.

03:13.727 --> 03:15.061
- Take care, man.
- Alright, thanks.

03:15.062 --> 03:17.462
- Good doing business.
- Yeah. Yeah, yeah. You, too.

03:19.767 --> 03:20.766
- Hey.
- Appreciate it.

03:20.768 --> 03:21.767
Yeah. Yeah. You got it.

03:21.769 --> 03:23.435
Thanks.

03:23.437 --> 03:24.469
Mel.

03:24.471 --> 03:25.737
There he is. What's up, Jimmy?

03:25.739 --> 03:27.706
Nothin' much, man.
Unsweet, just like you like.

03:27.708 --> 03:30.943
Thank you, buddy. So who's watching the
store? You just leave it open over there?

03:30.945 --> 03:33.445
Oh, man. Of course, I did.
Left the register open, too.

03:33.447 --> 03:36.048
Let it air out. That's what you
do when you pay your insurance.

03:36.050 --> 03:38.250
- Yeah.
- You mind if I charge this thing up, man?

03:38.252 --> 03:39.718
Sure, man. Hold on.
Right here.

03:39.720 --> 03:41.086
Awkwardly-placed plug.

03:41.088 --> 03:43.155
Almost ended up
with Southern-fried iPhone.

03:43.157 --> 03:45.424
- You know you don't want that.
- Nah.

03:45.426 --> 03:46.892
Look at this thing.

03:46.894 --> 03:49.228
It's old and was never a good
guitar,

03:49.230 --> 03:52.531
but now, it's a, it's an antique
amazing guitar.

03:55.069 --> 03:56.568
Ugh!

03:56.570 --> 03:59.104
Ugh! That, uh.. You gotta be..

03:59.106 --> 04:01.773
All day. All day.
I get this, man.

04:01.775 --> 04:04.009
How do I get a job like that?

04:04.011 --> 04:05.511
You might have it.
You need a job like that?

04:05.512 --> 04:07.279
- Heh-heh-heh.
- You want it?

04:07.281 --> 04:08.748
Let me, Le... let me see what's
left in the register.

04:08.749 --> 04:10.983
- Okay.
- I'm gonna leave this here.

04:10.985 --> 04:12.518
Okay, man. How much I owe you
for the tea?

04:12.519 --> 04:14.354
- Ah, just put it on my tab.
- Alright. Alright.

04:14.355 --> 04:15.922
You know I got my eye on that
bugle in the back.

04:15.923 --> 04:18.023
Oh, yeah. That bugle's got your
name on it, buddy.

04:18.024 --> 04:19.024
Thanks.

04:19.026 --> 04:21.760
Oh, hey. Uh..

04:21.762 --> 04:24.730
Hey, Mel, you, um, you want me to
take that stuff back to holding?

04:24.732 --> 04:25.798
- You mean this stuff?
- Yeah.

04:25.799 --> 04:27.599
No, I got it, apparently.

04:27.601 --> 04:30.168
Alright. I'll just.. I'll fill
out the paperwork.

04:30.170 --> 04:31.738
Yeah, why don't you fill out
the paperwork?

04:31.739 --> 04:33.238
Okay.

04:33.240 --> 04:36.508
Is that boots and a guitar.

04:36.510 --> 04:38.277
What kind of guitar is it?

04:40.648 --> 04:41.747
Okay.

05:05.639 --> 05:07.673
- Somebody there?
- I know.

05:07.675 --> 05:10.242
Is the door locked?

05:10.244 --> 05:12.511
Oh.

05:12.513 --> 05:14.513
- Hello?
- Hello?

05:14.515 --> 05:16.381
Hello.

05:20.087 --> 05:22.220
It looks exactly the same.

05:24.758 --> 05:27.693
Oh!

05:27.695 --> 05:29.261
- Uh..
- Hi, guy.

05:29.263 --> 05:31.963
That's my papa, Joe.
Next to my daddy.

05:31.965 --> 05:34.633
- They look like twins.
<i>- No way!</i>

05:34.635 --> 05:36.068
- What?
- He said he quit.

05:36.070 --> 05:37.536
Ew! Is that gum?

05:37.538 --> 05:39.705
- Well, yeah. That's his signature move.
- Hm.

05:39.707 --> 05:41.940
We used to go out to
restaurants, he'd order a meal

05:41.942 --> 05:44.609
he'd take it out and put it
right on the plate.

05:44.611 --> 05:47.479
And then he'd eat his meal
and then put it right back in.

05:47.481 --> 05:48.480
Look how..
Cute you are!

05:48.482 --> 05:49.948
Oh, I'm so proud of you.

05:49.950 --> 05:51.183
Aww..

05:51.185 --> 05:53.885
Oh, that was at my Aunt
Dee-dee's ranch.

05:53.887 --> 05:56.221
Mm-hmm. Sweetie,
see why we gotta..

05:56.223 --> 05:59.658
- I know.
- Look how cute she is.

05:59.660 --> 06:03.328
<i>Isn't it weird seeing some of
this stuff?</i>

06:03.330 --> 06:06.798
<i>It's like, feels like a dream.</i>

06:06.800 --> 06:09.801
<i>I should've visited more.</i>

06:09.803 --> 06:11.670
- Why didn't I do that?
- I don't know.

06:11.672 --> 06:13.171
Well, what can you do?

06:14.908 --> 06:16.842
You hungry?

06:16.844 --> 06:18.777
I'm scared to look in there. Oh.

06:18.779 --> 06:21.346
Oh, my God!

06:21.348 --> 06:22.781
<i>Hello.</i>

06:22.783 --> 06:24.716
Hello?

06:24.718 --> 06:25.917
- Hey. Hi.
- Hello.

06:25.919 --> 06:28.687
Huh! Hi.

06:28.689 --> 06:29.988
- Hi.
- Sorry.

06:29.990 --> 06:31.423
- Sorry.
<i>- Hi there.</i>

06:31.425 --> 06:33.426
- We didn't mean to scare you.
- Oh, it's okay. That's alright.

06:33.427 --> 06:37.162
Ahem. Well, um, you must be Mr.
Everly's, uh, granddaughter.

06:37.164 --> 06:40.465
- That I am.
- Well, hi there. My name is Phyllis.

06:40.467 --> 06:43.101
- Hi.
- We've got a couple of details we could go over.

06:43.103 --> 06:47.239
So why don't y'all just take a seat at the
table and we'll get right down to it. Okay?

06:47.241 --> 06:50.809
- Alright.
<i>- Uh-huh. I'll be right in there.</i>

07:15.803 --> 07:17.335
<i>Hey, Nathaniel.</i>

07:17.337 --> 07:18.537
Oh, hey, Deirdre.

07:18.539 --> 07:19.805
<i>How are you doin'?</i>

07:19.807 --> 07:21.239
Good. How are you?

07:21.241 --> 07:22.307
Good. Good.

07:22.309 --> 07:24.910
- Ugh!
- Is Mel around?

07:24.912 --> 07:27.780
Yeah. No. He's just in the back. He's,
he's putting some stuff in holding.

07:27.781 --> 07:30.148
Okay, cool. Cool.

07:30.150 --> 07:31.216
You look good.

07:31.218 --> 07:32.951
Well, thanks.

07:32.953 --> 07:34.986
Hey,
you still makin' those poems?

07:34.988 --> 07:38.790
Oh, yeah. It's kind of what
keeps me going, you know?

07:38.792 --> 07:40.826
Well, can I hear one?

07:40.828 --> 07:41.993
- You wanna hear one?
- Yeah.

07:41.995 --> 07:44.596
That is so sweet.

07:44.598 --> 07:46.833
Um, well, I have the book with me.
I always have it with me. So..

07:46.834 --> 07:48.033
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

07:48.035 --> 07:50.202
Let me see
what I can dig up here.

07:52.573 --> 07:55.774
No. No, no. Not that one.

07:55.776 --> 07:59.344
Ooh. I hate all these.
Why don't I just write you one?

07:59.346 --> 08:00.412
- Okay. Yeah.
- Okay.

08:00.414 --> 08:02.581
That sounds good.

08:02.583 --> 08:06.618
I just need to talk to him
for a second. Quick second.

08:06.620 --> 08:08.053
Yeah.

08:08.055 --> 08:09.155
It's really good to see you,
though.

08:09.156 --> 08:10.655
It's really good to see you,
too.

08:11.692 --> 08:14.025
Can't believe it's, uh,
been so long.

08:14.027 --> 08:15.594
<i>You know?</i>

08:17.197 --> 08:20.298
Wow! Nice boots.

08:20.300 --> 08:21.766
It's new?

08:28.008 --> 08:32.644
Those the ones that guy just
came, uh, came in with?

08:44.358 --> 08:49.294
She's just writing me a poem.
So..

08:49.296 --> 08:50.829
Okay.

09:05.646 --> 09:06.745
Gotta sign it.

09:09.783 --> 09:11.583
- There you go.
<i>- Thank you.</i>

09:16.423 --> 09:19.691
So, you owe me dinner.

09:19.693 --> 09:22.762
When are you gonna come over and cook
for me? Have you ever had his guacamole?

09:22.763 --> 09:24.229
<i>- Nope.</i>
- It is amazing.

09:24.231 --> 09:26.464
He's still got a little New
Mexico in him.

09:28.302 --> 09:30.535
I don't think that'd be a very
good idea.

09:34.608 --> 09:36.575
Fair enough.

09:36.577 --> 09:38.377
I'm not letting you off the
hook, though, that easy.

09:38.378 --> 09:41.246
I'm gonna keep trying 'cause you
do owe me that fuckin' dinner.

09:43.383 --> 09:46.084
What, what's goin' on, Dee?

09:46.086 --> 09:47.652
Um..

09:53.527 --> 09:55.327
Stuck on there.

10:02.469 --> 10:04.469
Really?

10:04.471 --> 10:07.372
It's, uh..
Uh, it's not for keeps.

10:07.374 --> 10:09.541
You can't keep it.

10:09.543 --> 10:12.377
This ring, though?

10:12.379 --> 10:14.312
What else do I have?

10:14.314 --> 10:16.514
It's all I have, and, uh,
I know you'll keep it safe.

10:16.516 --> 10:18.383
I'm just.. It's just collateral.

10:18.385 --> 10:23.221
I'm gonna come back for it with the
interest and everything. Every last penny.

10:23.223 --> 10:25.791
You know I'm good for it. I mean,
I'm, I swear to God, I'm good for it.

10:25.792 --> 10:28.793
You know I am because I fuckin' love
this ring. You know how much I love it.

10:28.795 --> 10:31.129
Can't doubt.

10:32.232 --> 10:34.099
You're not good for it.

10:39.873 --> 10:41.473
I am, and here's why.

10:41.475 --> 10:44.442
Because I have a job,
I don't know if you heard.

10:44.444 --> 10:47.746
I got a job that is,
uh, going great.

10:47.748 --> 10:50.248
They like me there, a lot.

10:50.250 --> 10:53.718
Um, they actually like..

10:53.720 --> 10:55.320
You know, they..

11:00.360 --> 11:05.630
They give me a chance, and, uh,
they're really nice to me, and..

11:05.632 --> 11:08.800
I'm doing good there.

11:08.802 --> 11:11.736
My fuckin' car broke down, I can't
get there, uh, unless I fix my car.

11:11.738 --> 11:14.406
I don't have any money and so I
just, I just need a fuckin' loan.

11:14.408 --> 11:17.208
Could you just give me a loan?
Could you just loan me some fuckin'..

11:17.210 --> 11:22.447
Do you know how hard it is for me to
come in here and ask you for this?

11:22.449 --> 11:25.383
Look, I, I'm not the Salvation
Army, you know?

11:25.385 --> 11:27.619
I can't.. I'm d..

11:27.621 --> 11:31.222
You know.. It's not charity,
I can't do it.

11:31.224 --> 11:32.924
Can't do it.

11:37.931 --> 11:39.164
Not this time, Dee.

11:39.166 --> 11:42.067
It's not,
it's not what you think.

11:42.069 --> 11:43.535
It's not what you think.

11:43.537 --> 11:47.639
- Isn't it?
- No.

11:47.641 --> 11:50.209
I know you have no reason to believe
me, but it's not what you think.

11:50.210 --> 11:51.810
Okay.

11:58.585 --> 12:01.186
Uh, you know..

12:01.188 --> 12:03.755
I got no one to blame but
myself. I nailed that door shut.

12:03.757 --> 12:07.025
I know. I did. Um..

12:07.027 --> 12:11.629
And I know it's stupid
that I came in here at all.

12:11.631 --> 12:16.468
What the fuck was I thinking?
Such a fuckin' idiot.

12:16.470 --> 12:18.303
Um, it was really good to see
you.

12:18.305 --> 12:21.106
<i>- You, too.</i>
- Seriously.

12:21.108 --> 12:23.742
Enjoy your, uh, poem.

12:23.744 --> 12:25.243
Thank you.

12:25.245 --> 12:28.980
And.. I'm sorry.

12:42.429 --> 12:44.229
Goddammit.

12:46.399 --> 12:49.367
<i>Okay. Well..</i>

12:49.369 --> 12:52.871
Like I said in the kitchen,
we've got a couple of things to discuss.

12:52.873 --> 12:54.672
- How's the roof?
- Yeah.

12:54.674 --> 12:56.674
I, I think it's fine.

12:56.676 --> 12:57.776
- Oh, good.
- That's good.

12:57.778 --> 12:59.711
'Cause I was gonna say,
if it is not,

12:59.713 --> 13:01.179
do people metal-seam roofs here

13:01.181 --> 13:03.915
or is that like a lightning rod?

13:03.917 --> 13:06.017
What about the plumbing?
Is it original?

13:06.019 --> 13:08.553
Um.. I actual.. I don't

13:08.555 --> 13:11.856
I don't know about the plumbing,
but, um..

13:11.858 --> 13:14.859
I'm sorry. Did, did you think
that you were getting the house?

13:17.631 --> 13:19.464
- Are we, are we not?
- No?

13:19.466 --> 13:24.002
Oh, I assumed that you knew that
there was a reverse mortgage

13:24.004 --> 13:29.073
put down on the house to help take care
of Mr. Everly in his waning years, so..

13:29.075 --> 13:30.909
No.

13:30.911 --> 13:36.114
The house belongs to the bank
now. Yeah.

13:36.116 --> 13:39.384
- Do we get it back from the bank?
- Um, wait.

13:39.386 --> 13:41.186
- So there's a reverse mortgage.
- Yes.

13:41.188 --> 13:45.023
Now, does that mean if we sell
it and we just take a hit?

13:45.025 --> 13:46.791
- Yeah, how about takin' a hit?
- No.

13:46.793 --> 13:49.394
Unfortunately, it, it does
belong to the bank now.

13:52.265 --> 13:55.366
I understand. It's, it's a lot
of news, but, um,

13:55.368 --> 13:58.937
I do think that you will be really
pleased with what you were left.

13:58.939 --> 13:59.938
- Oh.
- Okay?

13:59.940 --> 14:01.873
Alright. Silver lining.

14:01.875 --> 14:06.311
Ahem. So this was really
important to Mr. Everly.

14:06.313 --> 14:09.013
It was the one thing he said he
didn't want to leave the family.

14:09.015 --> 14:11.282
So here you go.

14:13.353 --> 14:15.220
What is it?

14:15.222 --> 14:17.155
It's a sword.

14:19.392 --> 14:21.226
What kind of sword?

14:21.228 --> 14:23.261
<i>An antique one.</i>

14:23.263 --> 14:26.531
Congratulations!

14:26.533 --> 14:29.033
- Thank you so much.
- Yes.

14:29.035 --> 14:32.270
He did also, specifically in
relation to the sword,

14:32.272 --> 14:34.706
he's left you this, and, um..

14:34.708 --> 14:38.042
It looks like a personal letter
as well.

14:38.044 --> 14:41.779
Um, I did wanna let you know
that, uh, the bank's not closing

14:41.781 --> 14:43.414
on the house for at least
another week.

14:43.416 --> 14:46.417
So if you need somewhere to stay,
you're welcome to stay here,

14:46.419 --> 14:51.022
although there.. The, the
bedroom smells a little funny.

14:51.024 --> 14:53.524
Okay. I'll get out of your way.
Okay?

14:53.526 --> 14:54.559
- Alright.
- Alright.

14:54.561 --> 14:55.560
- Thank you, Phyllis.
- Of course.

14:55.562 --> 14:57.962
- Yeah.
- Buh-bye.

14:57.964 --> 14:59.397
Thank you. You're very..

14:59.399 --> 15:00.932
I.. We appreciate it.
We appreciate it.

15:00.934 --> 15:02.700
<i>- No problem.</i>
- We appreciate it.

15:02.702 --> 15:04.602
<i>- Bye!</i>
- Thank you.

15:08.975 --> 15:12.577
I am so sorry. I know this
wasn't what you were hoping for.

15:16.316 --> 15:17.982
I mean..

15:22.055 --> 15:26.991
Oh, my goodness!
I remember this old thing.

15:26.993 --> 15:30.328
He used to bring it out at
Christmas time and, um

15:30.330 --> 15:32.330
on birthdays, special occasions.

15:32.332 --> 15:33.731
Mm-hmm.

15:38.972 --> 15:40.638
I just think
it's really screwed up.

15:40.640 --> 15:43.808
It's, like, what is wrong
with our society?

15:43.810 --> 15:46.010
He worked himself to the bone
his whole life.

15:46.012 --> 15:50.715
But he had to leverage every single thing
he owned to see him through his old age?

15:50.717 --> 15:55.520
And then he can't leave you anything,
except this, probably, useless old..

15:55.522 --> 15:58.656
What? What are you reading?
What's it say?

15:58.658 --> 16:00.591
You tell me.

16:03.029 --> 16:05.163
Mm-mm-mm-mm.

16:06.466 --> 16:09.000
Okay. Okay.

16:10.570 --> 16:12.770
- Okay.
- Keep goin'.

16:12.772 --> 16:15.773
He's very clearly a little..

16:15.775 --> 16:18.910
- Was he?
- Demented? Yeah. Very.

16:20.981 --> 16:25.016
What is this that he's..
Why is he saying Sherman?

16:25.018 --> 16:27.652
And then on the next page
it says Sheridan.

16:29.422 --> 16:30.855
Chickabaaga.

16:30.857 --> 16:32.124
But then here it says Chickaboo.

16:32.125 --> 16:33.558
Yeah.

16:35.996 --> 16:38.396
This is not saying what I think
it's saying.

16:38.398 --> 16:40.131
Yeah. It's bad.

16:50.377 --> 16:52.810
Oh, my God!

16:52.812 --> 16:57.048
Oh. Honey,
I have the heebies. I..

16:57.050 --> 16:59.150
I don't want anything to do
with this.

17:13.266 --> 17:15.566
That's Charley Patton.

17:15.568 --> 17:18.301
Charley Patton was a,
uh, a blues man.

17:18.304 --> 17:20.104
One of the originals.
Delta blues.

17:20.106 --> 17:23.374
Actually, the guy. Maybe you've
heard of Robert Johnson?

17:23.376 --> 17:27.912
<i>'Cause I think Charley Patton actually
taught Robert Johnson how to play guitar.</i>

17:27.914 --> 17:31.149
<i>And he was part-Indian
actually, American Indian.</i>

17:31.151 --> 17:34.519
- I'm just nervous.
<i>- Cherokee or, uh Choctaw. I just learned..</i>

17:34.521 --> 17:37.288
I just feel like, the story,
it was so crazy.

17:37.290 --> 17:39.323
I can't remember the right
details.

17:39.325 --> 17:41.826
Confidence. Just got to be in
here with confidence, alright?

17:41.828 --> 17:44.929
I don't think I can sell that
one. I just decided that.

17:44.931 --> 17:46.264
- Oh.
- There's other ones.

17:46.266 --> 17:48.766
I... I, I like that one.
I.. Maybe I'll sell it.

17:48.768 --> 17:50.168
<i>I don't know.</i>

17:50.170 --> 17:51.602
We're just gonna get a price.

17:51.604 --> 17:56.474
<i>- Have a good day.</i>
- You have a good day, too.

17:56.476 --> 17:58.676
<i>How are you, ladies?</i>

17:58.678 --> 18:00.545
What do you got?

18:00.547 --> 18:02.346
Uh, we're lookin'
to sell this item.

18:03.716 --> 18:05.450
Well, that's interesting seal.

18:05.452 --> 18:08.019
I don't think I've ever seen
that before. What is it? A sword?

18:08.021 --> 18:09.921
- That's right.
- Can I look at it?

18:09.923 --> 18:12.356
Yeah, just be careful.

18:12.358 --> 18:14.425
It's very fragile.

18:14.427 --> 18:16.861
Mm-hmm. Oh, yeah.

18:16.863 --> 18:20.631
Haven't seen one of these in a
while. Civil War period.

18:20.633 --> 18:21.966
<i>- Mm-hmm.
- Mm-hmm.</i>

18:21.968 --> 18:24.735
Can I take a look at it
underneath the glass?

18:24.737 --> 18:26.404
Uh, sure.

18:31.244 --> 18:34.345
Oh! This kitty cat.

18:34.347 --> 18:35.546
Is this is a cream pitcher?

18:35.548 --> 18:40.284
Uh.. Yeah.
Yeah, cream pitcher.

18:40.286 --> 18:42.086
- 'Cause a cat always wants milk.
<i>- Scabbard.</i>

18:42.088 --> 18:44.355
- So it's kind of..
- I know. That's right.

18:45.592 --> 18:47.458
Okay, I'm gonna take it out.

18:51.898 --> 18:53.331
It's in very good shape.

18:53.333 --> 18:55.466
<i>Mm-hmm.</i>

18:55.468 --> 18:58.903
Seems like the real deal.

18:58.905 --> 19:03.241
And it's a Union sword which I
don't see around here much.

19:03.243 --> 19:05.743
Mostly Confederate swords.

19:07.080 --> 19:10.715
Okay. Well, I can give you..

19:12.218 --> 19:13.384
Hm.

19:15.488 --> 19:20.291
How about 400 in cash
for this sword today?

19:20.293 --> 19:21.460
That's a.. No, that's a
reasonable offer.

19:21.461 --> 19:23.661
That's a nice, that's a nice
first, uh, toss.

19:23.663 --> 19:25.296
- I can see why you would do that.
- Uh..

19:25.298 --> 19:27.766
- Only because you don't know the story behind it.
- That's right.

19:27.767 --> 19:31.102
Well, I, I've seen this type of
sword a bit before.

19:31.104 --> 19:34.572
I think it's a good price,
you know, with or without story.

19:34.574 --> 19:36.807
- Mm-hmm.
- Think you're gonna wanna hear this.

19:36.809 --> 19:38.276
You're gonna wanna hear this
story.

19:38.278 --> 19:41.112
- Okay. I'm all ears.
- Right.

19:41.114 --> 19:42.113
- Okay.
- Tell him the story.

19:42.115 --> 19:43.147
Uh, you're correct.

19:43.149 --> 19:44.515
This is a Union sword.

19:44.517 --> 19:46.551
This was given to my great-great

19:46.553 --> 19:49.787
great-great-grandpappy

19:49.789 --> 19:52.456
who was a field marshal
in the Confederate Army.

19:52.458 --> 19:57.295
- Yeah.
- And this was surrendered to him by General Sherman.

19:57.297 --> 20:00.498
- Sheridan.
- Sheridan.

20:00.500 --> 20:04.302
It was surrendered to him
by a Union general? I..

20:04.304 --> 20:07.505
- Mm-hmm.
- What battle are we talking about here?

20:07.507 --> 20:10.241
This battle?
Oh. It's Chickabauga.

20:10.243 --> 20:11.342
<i>Chickabaaga?</i>

20:11.344 --> 20:14.178
Chickabauga.

20:14.180 --> 20:15.479
- I don't..
- Oh.

20:15.481 --> 20:16.949
- I don't think that battle..
- Not familiar with it?

20:16.950 --> 20:18.049
I don't think it happened.

20:18.051 --> 20:19.517
- Well, it happened.
- Okay.

20:19.519 --> 20:22.053
I assure you, 30,000 men lost
their lives that day.

20:22.055 --> 20:23.654
- Wow!
- Mm-hmm.

20:23.656 --> 20:26.124
- You probably haven't heard of it 'cause it's buried.
- Mm-hmm.

20:26.125 --> 20:28.025
- Buried?
- It's not in history books.

20:28.027 --> 20:30.261
- Mm-hmm.
- Hey, what do you mean buried?

20:30.263 --> 20:33.998
It is buried from the history
books..

20:34.000 --> 20:35.066
Yeah.

20:35.068 --> 20:38.502
...by... deep state.

20:40.340 --> 20:41.505
- Yeah.
- Okay.

20:41.507 --> 20:43.541
- Because of deep state.
- She's saying it's..

20:43.543 --> 20:45.176
- Deep state?
- Deep state. Yeah.

20:45.178 --> 20:46.944
Shadow government.

20:46.946 --> 20:48.814
Oh, that was the original name?
Shadow government?

20:48.815 --> 20:50.414
Okay, what you're looking at..

20:50.416 --> 20:52.917
- Yes.
- ...is a genuine relic.

20:52.919 --> 20:55.820
- Is it?
- A very valuable piece of evidence..

20:55.822 --> 20:57.321
<i>Mm-hmm.</i>

20:57.323 --> 21:00.191
...that supports
the actual truth,

21:00.193 --> 21:04.795
which is, the South won the war.

21:06.733 --> 21:08.833
- Okay. The South won the war?
- That's right.

21:11.037 --> 21:13.704
- Show him the documentation.
- Yeah.

21:13.706 --> 21:15.673
There.. Here.

21:15.675 --> 21:18.175
Have you told anybody else this?

21:18.177 --> 21:21.513
This is something you wanna keep under your hat
till you're ready to not keep it under your hat.

21:21.514 --> 21:23.114
It seems like pretty big news.

21:23.116 --> 21:26.017
This is a certificate of authenticity.
Can you read what that says?

21:26.019 --> 21:28.919
Yeah. The Order of Invictusians.

21:28.921 --> 21:30.187
- Mm-hmm.
- Mm-hmm.

21:30.189 --> 21:34.492
- Truth, truth, truthers.
- The bearers of truth.

21:34.494 --> 21:37.695
"In his elected authority as
keeper of truth does hereby

21:37.697 --> 21:40.965
"vouch safe and authorize
legitimate authenticity, uh,

21:40.967 --> 21:44.735
and voracity of the Union officers
sword.." I, I don't know what this is..

21:44.737 --> 21:47.705
- Read what year that is, please.
- I see the date, it says 1881.

21:47.707 --> 21:50.875
- But I... I mean, it could say today, and I... I don't..
- Can you..

21:50.877 --> 21:52.943
- Careful. Just careful.
- Alright.

21:52.945 --> 21:53.979
- Alright.
- Great. So that's that.

21:53.980 --> 21:56.814
- So.. That's that.
- Mm-hmm.

21:56.816 --> 21:58.083
Alright, are you sure he's ready
for this?

21:58.084 --> 22:00.251
<i>Listen.. This is gonna blow
your mind..</i>

22:00.253 --> 22:01.652
Bam!

22:01.654 --> 22:03.888
Bam?

22:03.890 --> 22:06.490
This drawing right here is
basically a photograph of the time.

22:06.492 --> 22:08.092
I know it's a drawing.

22:08.094 --> 22:09.927
- This is General McClellan..
<i>- Mm-hmm.</i>

22:09.929 --> 22:13.464
...surrendering to General Lee.

22:13.466 --> 22:16.667
Right, but I, I mean,
it doesn't mean anything.

22:16.669 --> 22:19.503
<i>- Well..</i>
- How does this not mean anything? How's this not proof?

22:19.505 --> 22:22.306
- Proof of the South winning the war?
- Correct.

22:22.308 --> 22:24.075
- I mean..
- This drawing?

22:24.077 --> 22:26.311
I mean, who's gonna wake up in the
morning and say I'm gonna draw a lie?

22:26.312 --> 22:28.145
- Yeah.
- Okay. Great.

22:28.147 --> 22:32.383
So the South won the war,
and these documents prove it.

22:32.385 --> 22:36.954
And, uh, this is a sword that
was part of that story.

22:36.956 --> 22:38.656
- The whole package?
- Mm-hmm.

22:38.658 --> 22:41.425
- Whole package.
- Now that you know..

22:41.427 --> 22:44.895
- Four-hundred dollars.
- Wait, what?

22:44.897 --> 22:46.298
What do you.. I mean, what were
you expecting really? This, I..

22:46.299 --> 22:48.300
I mean, I don't.. We don't, we
don't, we don't need this.

22:48.301 --> 22:50.167
Uh, it's hard to believe that..

22:50.169 --> 22:52.237
The truth. It's hard for people
to swallow the truth.

22:52.238 --> 22:53.638
- It is. It's hard. Look..
- You're..

22:53.639 --> 22:55.840
You're saying that the South won
the Civil War, correct?

22:55.842 --> 22:56.907
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

22:56.909 --> 22:58.943
- Alright.
- Have a great day.

22:58.945 --> 23:00.578
Thank you.

23:02.615 --> 23:04.448
<i>You know what?</i>

23:11.157 --> 23:12.590
- My name is Mary.
- Mm-hmm.

23:12.592 --> 23:15.960
When you come to your senses,
that's how you reach me.

23:15.962 --> 23:18.028
Thank you. I'm Mel.

23:20.333 --> 23:24.168
- I should.
- Mm? Where are you goin'?

23:24.170 --> 23:25.303
Is this cream pitcher true
to tag?

23:25.304 --> 23:27.505
- True to what?
- Is it $15?

23:27.507 --> 23:29.707
Yes.

23:29.709 --> 23:31.175
I'm Cynthia.

23:31.177 --> 23:34.145
I'm Nathaniel,
if you come back in.

23:34.147 --> 23:35.946
- What?
- You gotta offer 5.

23:35.948 --> 23:39.383
He says 12, you say 7,
then you end up on 8.

23:39.385 --> 23:40.584
I didn't know..

23:40.586 --> 23:43.888
No, when you're buying..
Come on, come on.

23:43.890 --> 23:47.725
Sorry. I didn't know.

23:47.727 --> 23:49.727
What was that bullshit? Wow!

23:49.729 --> 23:53.731
You think I was born yesterday? I mean,
what kinda, what kind of scam was that?

23:53.733 --> 23:56.133
- Uh, uh..
- I mean, who'd they think they were talking to?

23:56.135 --> 24:00.104
A fuckin' idiot? I don't know.
Maybe they really believe that shit.

24:00.106 --> 24:01.640
I mean, you know what the
problem with it is?

24:01.641 --> 24:03.674
Here's the problem
with believing bullshit

24:03.676 --> 24:06.477
is that eventually it'll erode
away the real truth.

24:06.479 --> 24:08.379
- Yeah.
- I think the sword was real.

24:08.381 --> 24:10.182
But why would you sit there
and go like, I got it.

24:10.183 --> 24:11.883
I know how we'll sell
this thing right away.

24:11.884 --> 24:15.052
So let's just say it proves that
the South won the Civil War.

24:15.054 --> 24:16.587
That was fucking ludicrous.

24:16.589 --> 24:19.056
It's insane.

24:19.058 --> 24:22.827
I mean, no one would believe that.
I mean, do you think they believe that?

24:22.829 --> 24:27.131
Well.. If they,
if they do believe it

24:27.133 --> 24:29.500
it looks like they're not
the only ones.

24:29.502 --> 24:34.371
<i>There have been so many crucial
battles in this war</i>

24:34.373 --> 24:37.708
<i>against the northern aggressors</i>

24:37.710 --> 24:40.044
<i>that have been obfuscated
and obliterated.</i>

24:40.046 --> 24:45.049
<i>And what I'm trying to do is
I'm just trying to unearth..</i>

24:45.051 --> 24:46.617
What the fuck is happening?

24:46.619 --> 24:48.052
<i>We've won this damn war.</i>

24:48.054 --> 24:49.587
There's more of these people?

24:49.589 --> 24:52.556
The best way to do this is
through artifacts.

24:52.558 --> 24:56.260
We need to come up with concrete
evidence and we..

24:56.262 --> 24:58.662
- Oh, it's that.. That's the same picture.
- Yeah.

24:58.664 --> 25:00.197
...handsomely for these.

25:00.199 --> 25:03.167
We are happy to pay
what these precious,

25:03.169 --> 25:05.069
precious items are worth.

25:05.071 --> 25:09.673
I'm talkin' $2000, $5000..

25:09.675 --> 25:12.576
Is this antique roadshow
for racists?

25:12.578 --> 25:15.546
<i>...Up to $50,000..</i>

25:15.548 --> 25:19.183
<i>- Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!</i>
- Holy shit!

25:19.185 --> 25:21.785
...Southern air
that we were meant to.

25:21.787 --> 25:26.557
And if you're gonna tell me that
my Southern grandma didn't win

25:26.559 --> 25:29.827
you and I have an issue!

25:29.829 --> 25:32.296
Goddammit!

25:32.298 --> 25:35.566
Let's get that sword and take these
fuckers for everything they're worth.

25:41.574 --> 25:44.174
<i>- Hello.</i>
- Hi.

25:44.176 --> 25:47.611
Uh, yeah, we have an item
we might wanna sell.

25:47.613 --> 25:50.548
No, we definitely,
that we definitely wanna sell.

25:50.550 --> 25:54.552
<i>You aren't one of them
carpetbaggers, are you?</i>

25:54.554 --> 25:57.521
- What?
<i>- Where are you callin' from?</i>

25:57.523 --> 25:59.790
<i>Birmingham, Alabama.</i>

25:59.792 --> 26:01.625
<i>Ha-ha. Alright. Right.</i>

26:01.627 --> 26:03.527
<i>Ho... hold on.</i>

26:06.666 --> 26:10.601
<i>Uh, I'm texting you
a WhatsApp handle.</i>

26:10.603 --> 26:11.735
What just happened?

26:11.737 --> 26:13.938
He's gonna WhatsApp us.

26:13.940 --> 26:15.339
What? Zap us?

26:15.341 --> 26:17.074
- What?
- What are you talking about?

26:17.076 --> 26:19.476
WhatsApp us. He's gonna WhatsApp
us. It's an app.

26:19.478 --> 26:20.979
- What is WhatsA..
- It's an app. It's... it's..

26:20.980 --> 26:22.513
Oh, right.
An app for the phone.

26:22.515 --> 26:25.049
- Yeah.
- Alright, so..

26:25.051 --> 26:28.953
Do you want, do you want me
to download it?

26:28.955 --> 26:31.021
- Yeah.
- Okay.

26:31.023 --> 26:33.657
It's just a simple app. It's not
like that big of a deal.

26:33.659 --> 26:35.492
It's, it's so that you can..

26:35.494 --> 26:38.629
It's so that you can message people,
uh, in like Europe and stuff.

26:38.631 --> 26:41.832
And it's also end-to-end
encryption so that no one can see

26:41.834 --> 26:43.734
your messages
even if they get your phone.

26:43.736 --> 26:45.936
- Right.
- Alright, well.

26:45.938 --> 26:48.606
Your handle is Delta Mel. Okay.

26:48.608 --> 26:49.974
<i>Yeah. I can be that guy.</i>

26:49.976 --> 26:51.241
Alright.

26:57.950 --> 27:01.318
Well.. Um, okay.

27:01.320 --> 27:04.421
It says, uh,
send picture of item.

27:04.423 --> 27:08.292
- We don't have a picture.
- No, I know.

27:08.294 --> 27:10.160
Thanks.

27:10.162 --> 27:12.329
Hey, Mary. Christina.

27:12.331 --> 27:13.398
- Mary, Cristina.
- Cynthia.

27:13.399 --> 27:14.531
- Cynthia.
- Cynthia.

27:14.533 --> 27:16.433
Alright. Uh, I know
you're excited

27:16.435 --> 27:17.968
but you gotta step back
a little bit.

27:17.970 --> 27:21.305
Alright. I've rethought it.

27:21.307 --> 27:24.808
I'm willing to offer you $650
for the sword.

27:24.810 --> 27:28.512
- Mm. Interesting. Goin' up.
- A little bit. A little bit.

27:28.514 --> 27:31.248
Yeah. Okay. What's the deal?
You just thought about it?

27:31.250 --> 27:34.351
No, we just, uh.. I looked at
some comparable swords

27:34.353 --> 27:35.887
and I, and I thought I low-balled you a
little bit, so I thought I'd offer you..

27:35.888 --> 27:38.689
Okay, so, so you found someone
who wants to buy?

27:38.691 --> 27:39.858
- Someone who is interested?
- No, there's nobody.

27:39.859 --> 27:40.892
I just wanted to offer you
a little bit..

27:40.893 --> 27:43.594
Nobody? Nobody's interested?

27:43.596 --> 27:46.463
Why can't I just rethink something
and then offer you more money?

27:46.465 --> 27:49.100
<i>Obviously, you got something up your
sleeve. I wanna know what it is.</i>

27:49.101 --> 27:51.802
- Seven-hundred-and-fifty dollars.
- Oh. Aha! Okay.

27:51.804 --> 27:53.704
So what's goin' on, good sir?

27:53.706 --> 27:55.140
You got, what, somebody offering you
ten times that, twenty times that?

27:55.141 --> 27:56.607
I did a little more..
No. No, no..

27:56.609 --> 27:57.642
Where are we? Where is it
falling?

27:57.643 --> 27:59.543
I think you're getting
way ahead.

27:59.545 --> 28:01.245
- You got a buyer?
- No. I, uh..

28:01.247 --> 28:02.613
- What's his name?
- I..

28:02.615 --> 28:05.449
<i>If, if there's a hypothetical
buyer, might..</i>

28:05.451 --> 28:08.585
<i>Okay, you know what? I'll give
you $800. Take it or leave it.</i>

28:08.587 --> 28:10.255
Oh, I think we'll leave it.
Thank you so much.

28:10.256 --> 28:12.757
Oh, where are you gonna go with
your sword and your silly documents?

28:12.758 --> 28:14.725
- We're gonna go get hot dogs.
- Alright.

28:14.727 --> 28:17.761
- Hey..
- Alright. Alright, alright, alright. Alright. Come on.

28:17.763 --> 28:20.698
- Come back. Just come back.
- Aw. You sure?

28:20.700 --> 28:22.533
- Let's talk turkey.
- Okay.

28:22.535 --> 28:24.368
Come on. What do you got?

28:24.370 --> 28:27.538
So there,
there's a interested party.

28:27.540 --> 28:29.407
- How much is she?
- Don't, please don't touch. Don't touch the tag.

28:29.408 --> 28:32.143
- I can't touch the tag?
- Don't touch the tag, because I will take care of that.

28:32.144 --> 28:34.746
- That doesn't make sense.
- You don't, but you don't understand. It's very precious.

28:34.747 --> 28:36.915
<i>Oh, I'm sorry. Am I getting in
the way of my little sword?</i>

28:36.916 --> 28:39.950
- The tag is?
- The, the offer stands.

28:39.952 --> 28:42.820
We can partner up on this thing,
but you need me to sell the sword.

28:42.822 --> 28:44.488
You need us,
or you're not selling shit.

28:44.490 --> 28:47.191
Alright, you have the sword.
Exactly. So..

28:47.193 --> 28:49.560
- That's right.
- Seventy-thirty sounds fair to me.

28:49.562 --> 28:51.495
Honey, seventy-thirty sound good
to you?

28:51.497 --> 28:53.697
Seventy-thirty?
Is it seventy for us?

28:53.699 --> 28:55.833
<i>- No.</i>
- No deal.

28:55.835 --> 28:58.135
Thirty for us. No deal.

28:58.137 --> 28:59.870
<i>Right. No. No deal.</i>

28:59.872 --> 29:02.473
<i>- Alright. Sixty-forty?
- No.</i>

29:02.475 --> 29:06.143
She's been through a lot.
Actually owned by Charley Patton

29:06.145 --> 29:09.246
who was a Chickataw. Chic.. Um..

29:09.248 --> 29:10.848
A Chickataw?

29:10.850 --> 29:14.284
He was a part-Indian,
uh, jazz guitarist.

29:14.286 --> 29:17.054
- Fifty-fifty.
- That's what I thought.

29:17.056 --> 29:21.191
Okay. Great. We gotta take a
picture of the sword.

29:21.193 --> 29:22.426
So take a picture.

29:22.428 --> 29:24.862
I can do that with my phone,
right?

29:24.864 --> 29:26.730
Yeah. I feel like
I'm in great hands.

29:26.732 --> 29:28.599
Yeah, you can take a picture
with your phone.

29:28.601 --> 29:31.268
- Hey, Nathaniel, can.. Nathaniel!
- Yup. Yeah.

29:31.270 --> 29:32.637
Can you take a picture
of the sword?

29:32.638 --> 29:35.205
Yeah.

29:35.207 --> 29:36.674
- Okay, do you want this one?
- I want the dress.

29:36.675 --> 29:38.275
- Okay.
- No heads.

29:38.277 --> 29:40.377
Alright.
Alright. I got it.

29:40.379 --> 29:42.247
- Can you get one with heads?
- Hey, we don't need..

29:42.248 --> 29:45.215
What are we doing now?
What's happening?

29:45.217 --> 29:47.885
Alright, we'll put this away.
You guys take this and we'll, uh,

29:47.887 --> 29:51.989
we'll get in touch with you with
the next phase of the plan.

29:51.991 --> 29:53.490
<i>We'll be in touch.</i>

29:56.862 --> 29:58.629
Alright. What happens now?

29:58.631 --> 30:00.964
I sent the photo,
now we just gotta wait.

30:00.966 --> 30:03.534
I think Cynthia
has a crush on me.

30:03.536 --> 30:06.570
No, I think you're
misreading that.

30:06.572 --> 30:10.674
Oh! Okay. Um, send address.

30:10.676 --> 30:15.546
We'll send someone tomorrow
at 10:00.

30:15.548 --> 30:16.914
- Okay.
- Yeah?

30:16.916 --> 30:18.081
Yeah.

30:20.820 --> 30:22.452
- You alright?
- This is exciting.

30:22.454 --> 30:24.121
It is exciting.

30:26.625 --> 30:32.462
Alright, 100, 200, 300, 50,
70, 80, 380.

30:32.464 --> 30:34.131
Great. And there is your coat.

30:34.133 --> 30:35.866
Oh, thank you.

30:35.868 --> 30:38.101
Yeah, just sign right there.
Great.

30:38.103 --> 30:39.803
- Thank you.
- And enjoy your coat.

30:39.805 --> 30:41.939
And if you need us to babysit
it again, we will.

30:41.941 --> 30:43.040
- Thank you.
- Okay.

30:43.042 --> 30:45.442
- Hopefully not.
- Hopefully not is right.

30:45.444 --> 30:46.543
Hey, Mr. Gayton.

30:46.545 --> 30:48.212
Hey, Jimmy,
what's happening, man?

30:48.214 --> 30:49.346
Did you come for the phone?

30:49.348 --> 30:51.882
Hey, you know the exchange.
Fries for phone.

30:51.884 --> 30:54.084
Fries? I can't eat 'em anymore,
you know that.

30:54.086 --> 30:55.886
I've got sludge in my heart.

30:55.888 --> 30:58.188
Oh, really? I thought you gave
up on that organ years ago.

30:58.190 --> 31:00.757
I did, but I still need it to
function so I can stay alive.

31:00.759 --> 31:01.893
What are you, what are you
doing?

31:01.894 --> 31:03.293
Well, do you have any ketchup?

31:03.295 --> 31:05.363
I think there's a couple of
packs of ketchup over there

31:05.364 --> 31:08.565
where you're usually sitting away from
me without.. You're like a growth.

31:08.567 --> 31:10.367
Alright.

31:10.369 --> 31:12.970
Ah, God. So what's happening?
How is your day going?

31:12.972 --> 31:16.840
Oh, man, so far so good, man.
But you heard about Deirdre?

31:16.842 --> 31:18.609
- What?
- Just life right now, man.

31:18.611 --> 31:21.511
Car trouble, job trouble.
Like, you name it.

31:21.513 --> 31:24.882
Alright, so what? She came by your
place and did the one-woman show?

31:24.884 --> 31:28.585
She did it here, too. It's very interesting,
it's very, very touching, very moving.

31:28.587 --> 31:31.588
Look, man, I can't do it anymore
with her, Jimmy.

31:31.590 --> 31:33.490
I can't give her money.
Then it never stops.

31:33.492 --> 31:37.160
She keeps taking money. I can't show up
as a friend because then it never stops.

31:37.162 --> 31:40.464
She keeps taking, taking till
I'm drained, I got nothing left

31:40.466 --> 31:43.600
I got no store, I got no life,
I got no car.

31:43.602 --> 31:48.005
It'll be just me and her strung
out with a goddamn shopping cart.

31:48.007 --> 31:50.908
Maybe a cat. Have you seen those cats
that can be with homeless people?

31:50.910 --> 31:53.144
Just on their shoulder and stuff.
Then that's what will happen.

31:53.145 --> 31:56.046
I'll just walk to your place and
it'd be both of us

31:56.048 --> 31:59.616
and she'll try to sell you a poem
and you'll be like, man, this is sad.

31:59.618 --> 32:04.121
And then I'll be like, "Yeah,
but look at the cat."

32:04.123 --> 32:08.058
I get it. Just remember why you
can't eat the fries.

32:08.060 --> 32:11.228
Oh! Alright. Understood.

32:12.131 --> 32:13.664
Thanks for the juice.

32:13.666 --> 32:16.166
Yeah, man.
Thanks for the knowledge.

32:35.220 --> 32:38.389
We're watching video online, we call the
number, they called us back, we downloaded...

32:38.390 --> 32:39.957
- Who is he?
- I don't know!

32:39.959 --> 32:42.459
- We have no idea.
- We didn't talk to the guys, we got..

32:50.636 --> 32:53.804
How you doing? Can I help you
with something?

32:56.875 --> 32:59.609
You might be able to.

32:59.611 --> 33:02.145
Are you the guy?

33:02.147 --> 33:05.582
Oh, most definitely the guy.
Are you the guy?

33:05.584 --> 33:09.619
Well, I'm the..
Uh, yeah, I am the guy.

33:09.621 --> 33:10.787
Hm.

33:10.789 --> 33:13.323
Mind if I ask your name?

33:13.325 --> 33:15.592
Hog Jaws.

33:15.594 --> 33:19.262
- Hog Jaws.
- Yeah. What's your name?

33:19.264 --> 33:21.131
Mel.

33:21.133 --> 33:23.433
Fair enough, Mel.
Can I open it up?

33:23.435 --> 33:25.168
Yup.

33:27.106 --> 33:29.973
Have you been touching it with a
bare hand? You shouldn't.

33:29.975 --> 33:32.009
- No. I didn't.
- There are no oils on this?

33:32.011 --> 33:34.611
No, sir.

33:34.613 --> 33:37.115
You mind if I take a look at this?
Can I take it out of the scabbard?

33:37.116 --> 33:39.017
- What?
- You mind if I take it out of the scabbard?

33:39.018 --> 33:43.153
- Yes.
- I'll take this out there. Yup.

33:50.796 --> 33:53.530
Okay, okay. Okay.

33:58.570 --> 34:01.471
- Alrighty.
- That's it.

34:01.473 --> 34:04.207
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

34:04.209 --> 34:05.942
It's not looking bad.

34:08.280 --> 34:11.014
We're getting down to it, Mel,
aren't we?

34:11.016 --> 34:12.482
Yup. Yup.

34:12.484 --> 34:15.185
I think we're getting down
to it.

34:15.187 --> 34:20.456
Says right here. Well, that's
encouraging.

34:22.527 --> 34:23.793
Whose sword is this?

34:23.795 --> 34:25.096
- Whose sword is this?
- Where did it come from?

34:25.097 --> 34:27.330
It's, uh, it's mine.
It's ours.

34:27.331 --> 34:28.900
Do you have any authenticity,
you have any papers on it?

34:28.900 --> 34:31.001
Yes, we do. We do. Right here.

34:31.003 --> 34:32.203
And there's a drawing you might
wanna see.

34:32.204 --> 34:33.904
- Drawing. There's a..
- Right.

34:33.906 --> 34:35.672
Certificate of authenticity.

34:36.675 --> 34:38.809
Alright. Heh.

34:40.245 --> 34:42.279
- Now, who's this Everly?
- That's my name.

34:42.281 --> 34:43.681
- That's my grandfather.
- That's your family, it's Everly?

34:43.681 --> 34:45.282
That's my, that's my family.
Yeah.

34:45.284 --> 34:47.150
- You got it from your grandfather.
- Yes.

34:47.152 --> 34:48.886
And... and where did your
grandfather get it?

34:48.887 --> 34:50.588
Okay, so her great-great-great
grandfather...

34:50.589 --> 34:52.722
I'd like to hear it from her
if I could.

34:52.724 --> 34:55.425
This is her family, her blood.

34:55.427 --> 34:56.993
Well, we both,
we both know the story.

34:56.995 --> 34:59.663
But you can talk on it.

34:59.665 --> 35:02.899
Yeah, well, I could. I could.

35:02.901 --> 35:08.004
Story goes, uh, Civil War.

35:08.006 --> 35:12.542
1803, and there we are,

35:12.544 --> 35:16.613
at the battle of.. Chickapoo.

35:18.450 --> 35:20.817
We're 15,000 people,

35:20.819 --> 35:24.554
3-30,000 people lost their lives
that day.

35:24.556 --> 35:29.459
Long story short,
my great-great-great-great-grandpappy

35:29.461 --> 35:34.531
he was a general in the
Confederate Army.

35:34.533 --> 35:40.637
Mm. A... and there they are
battling up against

35:40.639 --> 35:44.641
uh, General Sherman Sheridan.

35:44.643 --> 35:46.943
They've got him cornered,
the Union.

35:46.945 --> 35:49.779
They were in that creek.
They don't know how to get out.

35:49.781 --> 35:52.449
And one of the soldiers
was like

35:52.451 --> 35:56.153
"This is a bad idea,
but I'll throw it out there."

35:56.155 --> 35:59.356
Why don't we surrender
your sword?

35:59.358 --> 36:03.760
This here is one piece
of history

36:03.762 --> 36:06.830
in the long list of pieces.

36:06.832 --> 36:12.469
That means that the South did,
in fact, win the war.

36:12.471 --> 36:14.871
- Exactly.
- Exactly.

36:14.873 --> 36:16.473
<i>Ain't it the truth? Hallelujah!</i>

36:16.475 --> 36:18.276
Well, that's what we we're looking
for is the goddamn truth here.

36:18.277 --> 36:19.943
- That's right.
- Mm-hmm.

36:19.945 --> 36:22.179
To get the truth, to get
to the bottom of this thing.

36:22.181 --> 36:25.482
- Yes.
- To eliminate the bullshit and the lies.

36:25.484 --> 36:28.251
- Yes.
- Let's, yeah, let's, let's put the truth out there.

36:28.253 --> 36:29.286
- Yes.
- Yup.

36:29.288 --> 36:31.955
Well, I'll tell you what.

36:31.957 --> 36:33.690
I'm gonna keep a lookout now.

36:33.692 --> 36:37.694
There are gonna be other offers
on this 'cause the word's out.

36:37.696 --> 36:41.164
- Word's out?
- But you wait for us.

36:41.166 --> 36:45.302
There's a lot of untrustworthy
motherfuckers around here.

36:45.304 --> 36:47.904
The boss may wanna see this,
we'll be in touch.

36:51.076 --> 36:54.144
Alright. I'll see you soon.

37:01.853 --> 37:03.753
Oh, my gosh,
I just had a panic attack.

37:03.755 --> 37:05.789
I, I didn't do.. Did I do it? It
sounded good?

37:05.791 --> 37:07.691
Yeah, it's great.
You did great. You did..

37:07.693 --> 37:09.693
- Oh, my God..
- Don't touch me like that!

37:09.695 --> 37:13.163
- Alright, listen, listen. Can I just ask you one question?
- What?

37:13.165 --> 37:17.167
Why didn't you just tell me from the
beginning that you're both full of shit?

37:17.169 --> 37:18.636
I mean, you couldn't even keep the story straight.
Well, you don't believe any of this shit.

37:18.637 --> 37:21.571
- What are you talking about?
- What are you talking about?

37:21.573 --> 37:24.507
If you're gonna run a con,
at least get the lies straight.

37:24.509 --> 37:27.877
- What inconsistency?
- It didn't even make sense, 15,000, 30,000.

37:27.879 --> 37:31.047
He's a general now? A general?
Wasn't he a field marshal before?

37:31.049 --> 37:32.683
- Okay. You know what? We..
- I mean, what the fuck?

37:32.684 --> 37:34.918
- It's very hard...
- Doesn't make any sense.

37:34.920 --> 37:37.922
From the beginning it's just, like, you're,
you're sitting there doing sign language.

37:37.923 --> 37:40.724
- She's making up shit.
- We don't believe it, we don't believe it.

37:40.726 --> 37:42.559
- Honey..
- I... is your grandfather real?

37:42.561 --> 37:44.861
- He's real.
- Yes, my grandfather is real.

37:44.863 --> 37:48.798
He, he just, he left this story and..
The story is real confusing.

37:48.800 --> 37:53.169
It's.. If you can make heads or tails
of it, great. Congratulations, but..

37:53.171 --> 37:54.771
Damn it.

37:56.508 --> 37:59.109
Oh, this is like a,
like a Alzheimer's..

37:59.111 --> 38:02.912
Yeah, and see how he's calling him
Sherman here and then look over here.

38:02.914 --> 38:06.816
Now he's Sheridan. Here he's a field,
field marshal. Now he's General Everly.

38:06.818 --> 38:11.021
So, so your grandfather was,
had mental problems and he..

38:11.023 --> 38:13.657
Well, he was 98.
He had troubles with the mind.

38:13.659 --> 38:15.825
Uh, alright, so let's just be
on the same page.

38:15.827 --> 38:17.728
We're just trying to sell this
thing for a lot of money.

38:17.729 --> 38:20.263
Well, you don't believe this
shit, and that's that.

38:20.265 --> 38:23.233
Okay, so I don't know who these
people are.

38:23.235 --> 38:25.669
I don't know what kind of scary
shit they're capable of.

38:25.671 --> 38:29.572
We gotta get this story straight and also,
maybe you should leave the sword here.

38:29.574 --> 38:30.941
- Wait a second.
- Yeah, just trust me already.

38:30.942 --> 38:32.810
What do you.. How is it gonna be
protected here?

38:32.811 --> 38:34.145
- We do have a safe. Yeah.
- I have a safe! Come on.

38:34.146 --> 38:35.179
- Alright, fine.
- Alright.

38:35.180 --> 38:37.380
- God! Use a glove.
- Careful.

38:37.382 --> 38:39.616
Have we learned nothing today?

38:42.988 --> 38:46.589
Fuck. Hey, do we have anymore
of this glass cleaner in back?

38:46.591 --> 38:47.657
Yeah, I think so.

38:47.659 --> 38:48.758
Can you grab it for me?

38:48.760 --> 38:50.794
- Yeah, I'll check.
- Thank you.

38:58.904 --> 39:00.737
How you doing, fellas?

39:00.739 --> 39:02.572
Whose place is this?

39:02.574 --> 39:04.341
Mine.

39:04.343 --> 39:05.842
Mm.

39:05.844 --> 39:08.044
What can I help you with?

39:08.046 --> 39:09.979
Why don't you say that again?

39:12.017 --> 39:13.450
What can I help you with?

39:13.452 --> 39:18.188
Mm. Don't sound like he's from
the South.

39:18.190 --> 39:21.858
I am from the Southwest.

39:21.860 --> 39:23.460
New Mexico.

39:23.462 --> 39:26.296
- Don't count it if it has Mexico in it.
- Mm-hmm.

39:26.298 --> 39:28.264
What, where did you think
I was from?

39:28.266 --> 39:30.867
- I thought maybe you're from the East Coast.
- Yeah.

39:30.869 --> 39:32.635
- Just face it..
- What does that mean?

39:32.637 --> 39:35.172
What do you, what do you mean when
you say that? Something East Coast.

39:35.173 --> 39:37.508
What does that mean when you...
You guys say that kinda stuff?

39:37.509 --> 39:39.709
I mean a bunch of things.
New York.

39:39.711 --> 39:40.710
Yeah, New Jersey.

39:40.712 --> 39:42.345
New Jersey, Massachusetts.

39:42.347 --> 39:43.880
- Maine.
- Maine.

39:43.882 --> 39:44.981
Some parts of Florida.

39:44.983 --> 39:48.351
Yeah, Virginia.
Some Mid-Atlantic.

39:48.353 --> 39:50.754
- Mm.
- You guys are smarter than I thought.

39:50.756 --> 39:52.756
Okay, so what can I help you
with?

39:52.758 --> 39:54.424
We came here looking for
something.

39:54.426 --> 39:58.228
Uh-huh. I got a lot of stuff.
Can we, can we narrow it down a little?

39:58.230 --> 40:01.631
Some might call it a prover
item, heard you have it.

40:01.633 --> 40:02.799
Prospect.

40:02.801 --> 40:05.201
A prover item? A prospect?

40:05.203 --> 40:06.504
Why are you just repeating
what he says?

40:06.505 --> 40:08.605
Because if I just said that to
you, would you know

40:08.607 --> 40:09.907
what the fuck I was talking
about?

40:09.908 --> 40:11.608
If I owned a pawn shop,
probably.

40:11.610 --> 40:13.676
- A prospect?
- We're looking for a sword. A sword.

40:13.678 --> 40:15.879
Alright.
See, why was that so hard?

40:15.881 --> 40:17.148
- It wasn't hard.
- It wasn't hard.

40:17.149 --> 40:19.416
Why did we have to take that
route to get there?

40:19.418 --> 40:21.285
Thirty seconds to get there.
It wasn't that long.

40:21.286 --> 40:25.255
Okay, sword. I have a couple
of swords over there.

40:25.257 --> 40:28.091
I got a Samurai
sword, I got another sword.

40:28.093 --> 40:31.094
I think it's a French sword.
I mean, those are the swords I have.

40:31.096 --> 40:33.230
I don't know what.. Are you
looking for a particular sword?

40:33.231 --> 40:36.566
We're looking for a sword, it's
American. It came in a couple days ago.

40:36.568 --> 40:40.737
I.. Okay. I... I've not seen a sword
come through here in a long time.

40:40.739 --> 40:42.540
- Doesn't seem like he's bein' honest with us.
- No.

40:42.541 --> 40:45.241
I don't know what you guys are,
are getting at

40:45.243 --> 40:47.811
but I, I, I think I've had
enough of this conversation.

40:47.813 --> 40:50.480
Alright. Whoa! What the fuck?

40:50.482 --> 40:53.016
Give us the fucking sword,
you fucking Jew.

40:53.018 --> 40:54.151
Yeah, I knew that's what you
meant when you said East Coast.

40:54.152 --> 40:55.585
Okay.

40:55.587 --> 41:00.123
Whoa, no, hey! Whoa! Hey, hey,
hey, hey, hey, hey! Let him go!

41:00.125 --> 41:03.426
- Who the fuck are you?
<i>- Hey, Mel!</i>

41:03.428 --> 41:05.628
Is it hot enough in here
for you?

41:06.765 --> 41:10.200
Yeah. Hey, Jimmy,
how is it going, man?

41:10.202 --> 41:11.668
Pretty good.

41:15.440 --> 41:17.407
Ain't got a problem,
we're just talking.

41:17.409 --> 41:19.542
Yeah.

41:19.544 --> 41:21.110
Just talking.

41:23.515 --> 41:25.381
Thanks for coming by, fellas.

41:25.383 --> 41:26.950
My pleasure.

41:31.990 --> 41:35.959
- Ah..
- What the hell, Mel? Don't you have a gun?

41:35.961 --> 41:37.560
- Yeah, I got a gun.
- Where is it?

41:37.562 --> 41:38.863
- I don't know.
- It's in the back.

41:38.864 --> 41:40.197
- It's in the back.
- It's in the back.

41:40.198 --> 41:42.866
The antlers are out here,
but the gun's in the back.

41:42.868 --> 41:43.933
Get it out here.

41:43.935 --> 41:46.102
Okay, I might not be here
next time.

41:46.104 --> 41:49.772
Alright, understood.
Thanks, Jimmy.

41:49.774 --> 41:52.141
Don't mention it.

41:52.143 --> 41:54.043
God.

41:54.045 --> 41:57.080
Well, I can barely breathe right
now. That was pretty..

41:57.082 --> 42:01.217
Yeah, was it hard for you when I
was being held at screwdriver point?

42:01.219 --> 42:02.620
- Uh, I..
- Was it a tough time for you?

42:02.621 --> 42:04.821
Can't believe you.. I was just
looking out for you, man.

42:05.557 --> 42:07.557
Hold on a minute.

42:07.559 --> 42:09.225
What? What is it? Who is it?

42:09.227 --> 42:11.995
Ho-ho-ho!
Oh, no. Holy shit.

42:13.798 --> 42:15.398
Huh?

42:15.400 --> 42:16.499
Forty-thousand dollars.

42:16.501 --> 42:17.901
Forty-thousand dollars.

42:17.903 --> 42:19.869
- Alright.
- That's crazy!

42:19.871 --> 42:21.905
- Okay.
- For that fucking sword.

42:21.907 --> 42:25.375
Wait, something else just came
in. Do we wanna sell?

42:25.377 --> 42:28.177
Yes, we wanna sell.
How was that even a question?

42:28.179 --> 42:29.846
I mean, I don't know, we just..

42:29.848 --> 42:31.114
Oh, tha.. Yeah, so what?

42:31.116 --> 42:32.982
Those, the garbage people are
gonna be, uh

42:32.984 --> 42:34.751
around us at all times
with this thing.

42:34.753 --> 42:36.619
Let's just,
let's just knock this out.

42:36.621 --> 42:40.056
- Done.
- Okay. Now what?

42:40.058 --> 42:43.560
I... I don't, I don't.. Okay.

42:43.562 --> 42:46.663
"Transport is coming to take you
to the bus. Wait outside."

42:46.665 --> 42:49.198
What, what does that mean,
transport?

42:49.200 --> 42:51.401
It means there's something
coming to pick us up and...

42:51.403 --> 42:53.636
Yeah, but why can't..
Wait, I don't know about that.

42:53.638 --> 42:56.205
I just.. Why can't they just
bring a briefcase of money?

42:56.207 --> 42:58.007
We gotta see the bus, Mel.

42:58.009 --> 43:00.310
We're in it now. Alright?

43:00.312 --> 43:01.744
We're in the shit together.

43:01.746 --> 43:05.315
We're in the shit, me, you,
the two ladies and that's it.

43:05.317 --> 43:07.917
And it's gonna be fucking
amazing.

43:07.919 --> 43:11.054
So we just gotta keep it cool,
we gotta get that $40,000.

43:11.056 --> 43:12.990
I'm so hard right now. I can
barely keep my mind straight.

43:12.991 --> 43:14.491
Wait a minute, are you using
that word right?

43:14.492 --> 43:17.060
Yeah, I think so. I'm just gonna
go take care of some business.

43:17.062 --> 43:21.531
Um, just, um.. Oh, let me know
when the ladies get here.

43:21.533 --> 43:22.599
This is..

43:42.187 --> 43:44.087
- Hey.
- Hey. Alright.

43:44.089 --> 43:45.622
- Hey.
- Hi.

43:45.624 --> 43:47.624
- Still got this, I see.
- Yeah.

43:47.626 --> 43:49.059
- No. Give her the sword.
- Oh, you want it?

43:49.060 --> 43:50.340
Oh, yeah, I want the sword.
Okay?

43:53.698 --> 43:54.464
Okay.

43:54.465 --> 43:55.231
What's all tied up back there?
Why the shovels?

43:55.233 --> 43:57.473
- I don't know.
- Hey, how are we all gonna fit in there?

44:00.205 --> 44:03.406
Think you have to do that to
turn the car off.

44:03.408 --> 44:07.644
Got it? Come on, Mr. Mel, let's
you and me take a ride.

44:07.646 --> 44:09.545
Should we just follow
in our car or..

44:09.547 --> 44:12.149
No, you're not gonna follow nothin'.
It's me and Mel. Come on, get that...

44:12.150 --> 44:15.351
No, no, no, no, no, no.
No, he can't.

44:15.353 --> 44:17.987
Sorry, 'cause
he's my, he's my husband and..

44:17.989 --> 44:19.523
I guess we're all going, we're
all going, baby, right?

44:19.524 --> 44:21.457
Yeah. We all have to go
because..

44:21.459 --> 44:22.659
I can't fit but one in here.

44:22.661 --> 44:25.128
No, listen. I know how it goes.

44:25.130 --> 44:28.064
You start your moonshine,
he's three days sober.

44:28.066 --> 44:32.635
Pastor Eric is not having it.
I'm not having it. I'm going with!

44:32.637 --> 44:36.706
And we're engaged and so..

44:36.708 --> 44:38.241
It's gonna be the four of us.
Some..

44:38.243 --> 44:40.109
Is there a way we can do that?

44:40.111 --> 44:41.944
I got another vehicle
I can bring up.

44:41.946 --> 44:44.580
How long is that gonna take?

44:44.582 --> 44:47.317
Take as long as it needs, I guess.
Why don't you stand here in the sun?

44:47.318 --> 44:49.152
I'll be right back.

44:49.154 --> 44:52.321
Fuck! Bullshit.

44:57.228 --> 44:58.896
You guys wanna go inside, wait?
It's a little hot.

44:58.897 --> 44:59.897
Yeah.

45:08.239 --> 45:11.541
<i>- It's very dangerous.
- I found out the hard way. Ha-ha-ha.</i>

45:11.543 --> 45:13.309
<i>Yeah, you did.</i>

45:13.311 --> 45:15.812
So we goin' outside,
walkin' outside.

45:15.814 --> 45:18.781
I wasn't paying attention
that there was a bench.

45:18.783 --> 45:20.616
- Is that right?
- Mm-hmm.

45:20.618 --> 45:23.486
I was looking back.
Walking forward.

45:23.488 --> 45:26.456
I tripped over the bench.

45:26.458 --> 45:28.057
I thought I fell on the bench.

45:28.059 --> 45:31.461
<i>I fell on my.. Ha-ha-ha!</i>

45:31.463 --> 45:34.130
Oh, my goodness. I was hurt.

45:45.977 --> 45:49.212
Well, fuckin' get in.

45:49.214 --> 45:53.516
This guy doesn't have a sedan?
Seats five comfortably.

45:53.518 --> 45:55.451
We're just gonna need one..

45:55.453 --> 45:58.755
Just a s... single..

45:58.757 --> 46:01.224
- Uh, yeah, I..
- I..

46:01.226 --> 46:03.459
This, this is definitely how
people die.

46:03.461 --> 46:06.562
Shh! No, no, no, this is how
individual people die.

46:06.564 --> 46:09.199
There is four of us. Plus, well, you
know, Mel, we have a, we have a weapon.

46:09.200 --> 46:12.002
It's a fuckin' sword. I don't think
you have a real understanding of death.

46:12.003 --> 46:14.704
Yeah. I mean, why are you so
excited about this thing, huh?

46:14.706 --> 46:17.607
- You know this guy?
- No!

46:17.609 --> 46:20.209
- You know this guy?
- No. Do you know this guy?

46:20.211 --> 46:21.812
- Do you know this guy?
- I don't know you. How do I know you're not in with him?

46:21.813 --> 46:23.547
- You know this guy?
- None of us know this guy. We just met him!

46:23.548 --> 46:27.517
- We don't even know you! You found the guy.
- Hey! Hey!

46:27.519 --> 46:29.685
Hey, what are you yammin' about?

46:29.687 --> 46:32.155
You want to have $40,000,
get in the van.

46:38.163 --> 46:40.730
- Oh, I don't have a seat belt.
- Honey, nobody's got...

46:40.732 --> 46:42.532
There's no seatbelt.
These are, but there's..

46:42.534 --> 46:44.734
No one's got seat-belts,
these are the tires.

46:44.736 --> 46:46.869
- This is a tire?
- Yeah, the tires are..

46:46.871 --> 46:49.172
Oh, oh. Here we go.

46:49.174 --> 46:52.275
Right, it's happening, man.

46:52.277 --> 46:53.910
We're in this shit now.

47:12.931 --> 47:15.932
Well, at least it's padded.

47:15.934 --> 47:17.967
So no one can hear you scream.

47:27.912 --> 47:33.749
So, so, um, how did the two
of you meet?

47:33.751 --> 47:37.286
<i>Oh, it's a long story.</i>

47:37.288 --> 47:40.056
I think we got some time.

47:40.058 --> 47:41.892
We met at a restaurant.
Her restaurant, actually.

47:41.893 --> 47:43.994
- It's not my restaurant.
- Well, I call it her restaurant.

47:43.995 --> 47:47.530
- It's not.
- I came in 'cause I needed a job desperately.

47:47.532 --> 47:52.835
And then, well, she gave me a... a simple
task and she thought I could handle it.

47:52.837 --> 47:54.503
And then I couldn't handle it.

47:54.505 --> 47:56.439
<i>- Like a cooking thing?</i>
- I was, uh, choppin'...

47:56.441 --> 47:58.507
Like a chopping thing.

47:58.509 --> 48:00.142
But can you chop
or you just nervous?

48:00.144 --> 48:03.145
<i>I'm not good on the job,
period.</i>

48:03.147 --> 48:06.082
<i>My mind goes places. But, uh,
yeah, she had to fire me.</i>

48:06.084 --> 48:10.286
- But...
- So then you, you yelled at me and I cried and..

48:10.288 --> 48:12.989
But then you,
you came out after me.

48:12.991 --> 48:17.426
You came out after me, you followed
me out and you said so aggressively

48:17.428 --> 48:21.898
"Do you, uh, do you wanna see
live music?"

48:21.900 --> 48:24.166
<i>That's all I could think of.</i>

48:24.168 --> 48:27.069
It's the way she said it, though,
you know, it just makes me laugh.

48:28.306 --> 48:30.473
How long have you been together?

48:30.475 --> 48:32.174
- Four-and-a-half years.
- Hm.

48:32.176 --> 48:34.744
So what's the big plan
with the cash?

48:34.746 --> 48:38.314
Well, we wanna, I mean,
eventually we wanna have a kid.

48:38.316 --> 48:39.849
<i>- Ah.
- Oh.</i>

48:39.851 --> 48:42.885
- That's nice.
- Mm-hmm. Can't really do it on our own, so..

48:42.887 --> 48:44.688
What, are you gonna buy a kid,
buy sperm? Have one? What..

48:44.689 --> 48:49.558
No, I want, I want Cynthia. I mean,
we talked about it. She'll carry.

48:49.560 --> 48:54.130
D.. Okay, so you're... you're gonna, you're
gonna carry the kid? That's the plan?

48:54.132 --> 48:55.331
I'm hoping, if I can.

48:55.333 --> 48:57.433
You seem the more motherly
of the two of you.

48:57.435 --> 48:59.068
- Oh, does she?
<i>- Yeah.</i>

48:59.070 --> 49:00.670
<i>Oh, that's.. Thank you.
That's great.</i>

49:00.672 --> 49:02.806
- You're welcome.
- I think he's meaning it as a compliment.

49:02.807 --> 49:04.241
Well, it doesn't sound like
a compliment.

49:04.242 --> 49:07.310
I think you're two sides
of the mother coin.

49:07.312 --> 49:10.980
Like, you know, you're just maybe uncomfortable
and I felt like I'd done something wrong

49:10.982 --> 49:12.582
and then I look at her and I'm
like it's gonna be okay.

49:12.583 --> 49:13.582
- Yeah.
<i>- Okay, so that's...</i>

49:13.584 --> 49:14.784
<i>That is so sweet.</i>

49:14.786 --> 49:16.485
So together you make
one good mom.

49:16.487 --> 49:18.421
No, I'm with you.
I'm not gonna argue this.

49:18.423 --> 49:19.755
I'm with you a hundred percent.

49:19.757 --> 49:21.325
You always sound like you are
arguing, am I right?

49:21.326 --> 49:22.726
- There's a tone that you have.
- I get that.

49:22.727 --> 49:24.795
It's like, like right away,
it's like we're not arguing

49:24.796 --> 49:26.295
but why are you talking
like that?

49:26.297 --> 49:29.765
Sometimes I get very angry and I
don't know where it comes from.

49:29.767 --> 49:33.002
It's like a cauldron and it's
just boiling all the time.

49:33.004 --> 49:34.071
- Why is that?
- And all of a sudden..

49:34.072 --> 49:36.706
I don't know why! It just is!

49:40.078 --> 49:41.511
- I'm sorry, honey.
- No, that's fine.

49:41.512 --> 49:44.146
See, that's what I mean. Like,
I'm not, I'm sort of mad at you

49:44.148 --> 49:48.718
because for some reason you rub me the wrong way,
but there's no specific thing you just did.

49:48.720 --> 49:52.288
Well, so we're lookin', we're lookin'
to have a... a family down the line.

49:52.290 --> 49:55.424
But first, um, I'm actually
gonna follow my dream

49:55.426 --> 49:57.593
and Mary supporting me,
which is so lovely.

49:57.595 --> 49:59.195
- Mm-hmm.
- What's your dream?

49:59.197 --> 50:01.998
Well, it's, uh, it's to own,
manage

50:02.000 --> 50:04.367
and create a successful escape
room.

50:04.369 --> 50:08.004
- Oh, wow!
- Wait, what's an escape room?

50:08.006 --> 50:11.073
Oh, you have 60 minutes in a
room and you got to solve a...

50:11.075 --> 50:14.377
A series of puzzles to
essentially escape the room.

50:14.379 --> 50:16.545
Who the fuck needs that in their
life? With the...

50:16.547 --> 50:19.548
That's what I was saying 'cause
I was thinking that is life.

50:19.550 --> 50:22.551
No, first she was not on board
with it and I said "It's

50:22.553 --> 50:25.821
it's a, it's an activity,
it's a type of fun."

50:25.823 --> 50:29.625
So, you know, for example, for the
casino room you'll find this, you know

50:29.627 --> 50:33.562
this laser pointer and, um, you can't
point it at anything from this angle

50:33.564 --> 50:36.999
'cause you're actually handcuffed to
the side of the room in the beginning.

50:37.001 --> 50:41.737
Uh, but if you point it into the mirror
up the top of the casino room, um

50:41.739 --> 50:46.308
it actually angles directly into something
that then unlocks. It's like a whole thing.

50:46.310 --> 50:47.910
So it's like an amusement park
thing.

50:47.912 --> 50:49.645
<i>No, but it's like in a
storefront.</i>

50:49.647 --> 50:52.314
You just set it up once and then
you just burn and turn.

50:52.316 --> 50:54.251
People just go through that thing and
they either do a good job or they don't.

50:54.252 --> 50:56.353
All day long, people are, like,
how do I get out of here.

50:56.354 --> 50:59.288
And if they win, you know what they get?
Tickets to another escape room.

50:59.290 --> 51:02.391
The money makes its own money.
It's crazy.

51:27.485 --> 51:29.685
How long have you two been
together?

51:29.687 --> 51:32.655
- Heh-heh..
- No, no.

51:32.657 --> 51:34.924
<i>- Oh, you're not together?</i>
- No. Come on.

51:34.926 --> 51:39.028
That's disgusting. Why he.. Ugh,
I would never.

51:39.030 --> 51:40.730
Um, well, I mean, you don't have to be insulting,
but, no, we are not, not that kind..

51:40.731 --> 51:42.598
Oh, no. Oh, Mel, no, I'm sorry.

51:42.600 --> 51:45.168
No, I.. Look, I think you have a,
you've, like, a really great face.

51:45.169 --> 51:49.071
I just don't think sexually
or compatible, compatible.

51:49.073 --> 51:51.207
Thank you. That's fine.

51:51.209 --> 51:54.643
<i>Yeah, no, we're... we're not together.
We're just, uh.. He's, uh..</i>

51:54.645 --> 51:57.012
- We're buddies.
- Yeah, he..

51:57.014 --> 51:59.482
I don't know. He's been working
for me for a few years..

51:59.484 --> 52:01.283
Yeah, three. Goin' on three.

52:01.285 --> 52:05.321
Came in wanderin' around like
some lost dog lookin' at stuff.

52:05.323 --> 52:06.956
I don't know, he seems..

52:06.958 --> 52:09.859
And then remember?
You had to leave that one day.

52:09.861 --> 52:11.360
- That's what started it.
- Yeah.

52:11.362 --> 52:14.263
I had to go deal with,
uh, Deirdre.

52:14.265 --> 52:16.298
And he was hangin' around.
I said, watch the store.

52:16.300 --> 52:20.469
And he watched the store
and now I, he's still here.

52:20.471 --> 52:22.037
Who's Deirdre?

52:23.808 --> 52:27.042
Uh, she's a friend of mine.

52:29.280 --> 52:31.914
But, um, but, yeah.

52:31.916 --> 52:34.817
So, yeah, so that's been a few
years that's he's been over there.

52:34.819 --> 52:36.919
But I've had this store.

52:36.921 --> 52:39.889
I've been work.. I've been there
for like 15 years now.

52:39.891 --> 52:41.657
<i>Why'd you get into pawn?</i>

52:43.828 --> 52:47.696
Well, what happened was sort of
a circuitous thing.

52:47.698 --> 52:51.600
Like I, you know, I come from
New Mexico.

52:51.602 --> 52:53.869
And then when I was in my 20s,
I was in New York

52:53.871 --> 52:57.873
and, um, I had a dream,
you know, back then.

52:59.410 --> 53:01.844
Uh, I was gonna, uh, you know

53:01.846 --> 53:05.080
be in a pretty important
rock-band.

53:05.082 --> 53:09.685
And I got to New York and I... I
got a job driving a van

53:09.687 --> 53:14.256
and, uh, lived on Lower East
Side.

53:14.258 --> 53:19.295
And I went to the sidewalk cafe
and there was a waitress there.

53:19.297 --> 53:23.265
Deirdre. She's pretty.

53:23.267 --> 53:25.100
I was pretty struck.

53:25.102 --> 53:29.705
And she's kind of loopy, but had
an edge to her, pretty funny.

53:29.707 --> 53:32.875
I don't know, just threw ahead
of my number, you know?

53:32.877 --> 53:35.712
And then she said, well.. Uh, you know, I
told her I was gonna put a band together

53:35.713 --> 53:38.380
and she's like,
I wanna be in a band.

53:38.382 --> 53:42.351
So we start hanging out,
trying to write some songs.

53:42.353 --> 53:47.122
She was into heavy drugs,
I was into lighter drugs.

53:47.124 --> 53:49.525
And, uh, you know..

53:53.798 --> 53:55.598
I started doing heavy drugs.

54:03.808 --> 54:05.474
We didn't start a band.

54:06.911 --> 54:11.413
We only just started working for
money to get drugs, so you know?

54:11.415 --> 54:15.851
Yelling, cryin', fucking,
for a while, but then that

54:15.853 --> 54:19.188
then that stops and just,
just doing drugs.

54:21.359 --> 54:25.060
And, you know, like, Sid and
Nancy were. Just ridiculous.

54:25.062 --> 54:28.163
Fuckin' farce. Tragic.

54:30.701 --> 54:35.604
Anyway, my Uncle Teddy, my Aunt
Rose lived down here.

54:35.606 --> 54:37.706
Kinda hippyish,
kinda not like my dad.

54:37.708 --> 54:40.276
Kinda like those older people,
you know, when you're younger

54:40.278 --> 54:42.311
you're like, that guy's cool.

54:42.313 --> 54:44.546
And I called him, I said,
"Look, man, I'm in trouble

54:44.548 --> 54:47.116
I can't tell my old man,
I'm strung out."

54:47.118 --> 54:50.819
He just said, "Well, come down here.
Let's... let's get you cleaned up."

54:50.821 --> 54:55.891
So I took off and then came down
here and Teddy took care of me.

54:55.893 --> 54:59.395
And then Aunt Rose got sick and they,
they needed to move 'cause for how..

54:59.397 --> 55:01.598
I don't know, he wanted to retire
and go to Florida, whatever.

55:01.599 --> 55:06.302
So he's, like, why don't you take the store?
So this is three years in, you know?

55:06.304 --> 55:07.836
What about the girl?

55:10.374 --> 55:14.009
She's followed me down here.

55:14.011 --> 55:16.779
I mean, I..
We talked about it.

55:16.781 --> 55:20.182
I guess we missed each other
and, you know..

55:20.184 --> 55:21.917
And she said she was getting
cleaned up.

55:21.919 --> 55:24.586
She said she was clean, she'd
come down here and stay clean

55:24.588 --> 55:29.091
and we can do the music
down here and, um..

55:29.093 --> 55:32.194
So she comes down here and it's
okay for a little while

55:32.196 --> 55:35.998
and then just figures out a way to
find the people to get fucked up

55:36.000 --> 55:39.635
and she got fucked up
and I didn't get fucked up.

55:39.637 --> 55:42.638
I didn't, I still haven't gotten
fucked up. It's been 15 years.

55:42.640 --> 55:45.407
I just watch her go in and out.

55:45.409 --> 55:49.745
<i>But, um, she's around.
She came in the other day.</i>

55:49.747 --> 55:52.581
Did you tell her?

55:52.583 --> 55:54.249
Tell her what?

55:57.121 --> 55:59.088
That you still love her.

56:03.060 --> 56:04.927
I stopped telling her.

56:08.666 --> 56:11.800
<i>I'm not strong enough for that chick.
And I don't have the fuckin' fortitude</i>

56:11.802 --> 56:14.103
<i>to tell that woman
that I love her.</i>

56:14.105 --> 56:17.306
She knows I love her or she
wouldn't come around all the time.

56:20.010 --> 56:21.577
But doesn't matter.

56:23.381 --> 56:27.383
You know, it's just like just
persistent heartache..

56:29.754 --> 56:32.488
You know, and that's that.

56:36.127 --> 56:38.193
Like, my life has been the same
for so long.

56:38.195 --> 56:41.697
Like, it's just a cycle of
stuff.

56:41.699 --> 56:45.300
'Cause I was just thinking of,
like, when we got in here like

56:45.302 --> 56:47.469
why the fuck am I doing this?
Have I come..

56:47.471 --> 56:49.605
Why the fuck am I in this truck?
I don't do this shit.

56:49.607 --> 56:53.709
What do we need to do this shit for?
I'm fifty-fuckin'-four years old.

56:53.711 --> 56:58.647
I'm just gonna get in the truck with
a fuckin' idiot and go to make a deal.

56:58.649 --> 57:00.115
- You know what it is?
- Money. What?

57:00.117 --> 57:02.518
No, it's not. It's not money.

57:02.520 --> 57:04.920
It's that moment
where this is a portal

57:04.922 --> 57:08.590
into whatever these fuckin' idiots,
the worst of them represent, right.

57:08.592 --> 57:12.661
You know, this, this guy is..
We're gonna see up close.

57:12.663 --> 57:14.731
Wherever he's takin' us there's
gonna be some answer, right?

57:14.732 --> 57:17.299
No, you're right, man. That,
it's a little titillating

57:17.301 --> 57:21.203
I gotta say, to get that up close and
personal with the stuff you read about is..

57:21.205 --> 57:24.541
Right, you spend a lot of time thinkin' like
how the fuck can these people think like this.

57:24.542 --> 57:27.309
- Yeah.
- Well, we're in the brain of that.

57:27.311 --> 57:28.577
Yeah, we're about to find out.

57:28.579 --> 57:30.179
Apparently, it's carpeted.

57:49.266 --> 57:52.000
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!
- Hm?

57:52.002 --> 57:53.869
Okay.

57:53.871 --> 57:55.604
What, are we off-roading?

58:00.978 --> 58:02.544
- Oh.
<i>- Oh.</i>

58:02.546 --> 58:03.745
- We stopped.
<i>- We stopped.</i>

58:03.747 --> 58:05.781
What is happening?

58:05.783 --> 58:06.815
Are we at a gas station?

58:14.492 --> 58:16.859
Whoo!

58:16.861 --> 58:19.595
Get out.

58:19.597 --> 58:20.996
Watch your head.

58:24.735 --> 58:28.170
Oh. Oh.

58:28.172 --> 58:29.571
- Wow!
- Wow!

58:29.573 --> 58:31.573
What would you call this area?

58:31.575 --> 58:34.309
We call this the country.
I'll go get the boss.

58:34.311 --> 58:36.144
Country north, country south?

58:36.146 --> 58:38.580
I call it motherfuckin' country.

58:38.582 --> 58:42.384
You know, there's the city we all are
from and then there's the country.

58:42.386 --> 58:44.454
- And now we is in the country.
- Yeah. What state are we in?

58:44.455 --> 58:46.255
- Tennessee.
- Okay.

58:48.125 --> 58:49.725
I'll go get the boss.

58:49.727 --> 58:51.393
Alright. Thank you, Hog.

58:51.395 --> 58:54.563
<i>- Jaws.</i>
- Jaws. Hog Jaws.

58:55.900 --> 58:57.367
Do you think they're gonna give
us something to eat?

58:57.368 --> 59:00.168
- 'Cause I'm so hungry.
- Oh, you need..

59:00.170 --> 59:03.272
What the fuck? Oh, these guys.
Are you serious?

59:03.274 --> 59:05.774
That fuckin' sword
belongs to us.

59:05.776 --> 59:08.544
Wait a minute, is that my
screwdriver?

59:08.546 --> 59:10.246
You took that screwdriver from
my.. You didn't pay for that.

59:10.247 --> 59:12.582
You took that off the counter.
You didn't pay for that screwdriver.

59:12.583 --> 59:14.049
<i>Jake, I thought we talked about
this.</i>

59:14.051 --> 59:16.285
This ain't his fuckin'
screwdriver, Zeke.

59:16.287 --> 59:18.921
- Are you sure?
- Yes, I'm sure. This is from my fuckin' truck.

59:18.923 --> 59:20.857
- I was in the truck!
- It's from the glove compartment!

59:20.858 --> 59:22.225
I was sittin' in front of the
glove compartment...

59:22.226 --> 59:23.960
I, I.. Whoa, whoa.
Wait, wait. Wait, wait, wait.

59:23.961 --> 59:26.862
Wait, wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

59:26.864 --> 59:29.431
Jake. Zeke.

59:29.433 --> 59:32.034
Jake Allmendinger?

59:32.036 --> 59:35.037
Zeke Durkin?

59:35.039 --> 59:38.273
- You know these guys?
- I do know these guys.

59:38.275 --> 59:41.910
I can't believe that you guys are
still friends. This is unbelievable.

59:41.912 --> 59:46.281
You're... you're June and
Buddy's kid, right?

59:46.283 --> 59:49.251
Buddy used to come in,
pawn those earrings

59:49.253 --> 59:51.520
your mom's earrings,
once a month for drinking money.

59:51.522 --> 59:54.656
You guys were like, four-five years old.
You come in with him, run around.

59:54.658 --> 59:56.892
One time.. Oh, my God!

59:56.894 --> 01:00:00.996
One time he beat the shit out of you in the
store for stealing somethin' off the counter.

01:00:00.998 --> 01:00:05.434
He hit you so hard that the, that he
was crying, too. It was, it was tragic.

01:00:05.436 --> 01:00:09.004
But then you come in with your
mom, like, a couple of weeks later

01:00:09.006 --> 01:00:13.408
to pick the earrings up and
sometimes you have black eye

01:00:13.410 --> 01:00:17.879
and, you know, she would buy
you ice cream and..

01:00:17.881 --> 01:00:22.217
Can I ask you a question? Why'd
you take after the shitty one?

01:00:22.219 --> 01:00:26.355
I mean, your mom was so nice,
you know?

01:00:26.357 --> 01:00:28.924
But you're all fucked up and
wrong-minded

01:00:28.926 --> 01:00:31.426
like your miserable dad.

01:00:32.730 --> 01:00:33.895
- Ah!
- Oh, no, Jake!

01:00:33.897 --> 01:00:35.263
I'm not fuckin' wrong-minded?

01:00:35.265 --> 01:00:36.699
I'm gonna poke this through her
fuckin' neck!

01:00:36.700 --> 01:00:40.936
And I put a hole of lead right
through the back of your skull.

01:00:40.938 --> 01:00:43.372
Where the fuck did that come
from?

01:00:43.374 --> 01:00:46.508
Alright now. Who's kickin' up
a fuss out here?

01:00:49.113 --> 01:00:53.248
<i>Well, lookie
here. Allmendinger and Durkin.</i>

01:00:53.250 --> 01:00:56.218
Y'all trespassing on Invictusian
territory.

01:00:56.220 --> 01:00:58.320
Now, you know you're up here
uninvited.

01:00:58.322 --> 01:01:00.722
We, we was just talking to 'em
is all..

01:01:00.724 --> 01:01:04.926
Oh, you're just talking to 'em
with a screwdriver to her neck.

01:01:04.928 --> 01:01:08.030
Now, did your boss send you up
here, is that the plan?

01:01:08.032 --> 01:01:12.768
No. You just brain trust hatch
this idea on your own, is that it?

01:01:14.872 --> 01:01:17.706
You two get off my property.

01:01:17.708 --> 01:01:22.678
I see you here again, I'll dig a hole just big
enough for the two of ya. You understand?

01:01:22.680 --> 01:01:23.679
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

01:01:23.681 --> 01:01:25.280
Don't say another fuckin' word.

01:01:25.282 --> 01:01:27.716
Get the hell off my property,
now!

01:01:29.887 --> 01:01:32.521
Folks, I'm real sorry
about that welcome.

01:01:32.523 --> 01:01:34.523
- Uh..
- Oh, sorry.

01:01:34.525 --> 01:01:38.527
Caught me in the middle of a, of
a little workday there, uh..

01:01:38.529 --> 01:01:42.230
Shoulder deep in a mare when you
pulled up, so..

01:01:42.232 --> 01:01:43.966
That's not something you can
just pull out of.

01:01:43.967 --> 01:01:48.570
She might get spooked and take
off across the field.

01:01:48.572 --> 01:01:52.140
You don't wanna be dragged
behind a powerful machine

01:01:52.142 --> 01:01:54.843
like that out in a country
like this.

01:01:54.845 --> 01:01:59.047
Wind up in a ditch dead
and nobody'd ever find you.

01:01:59.049 --> 01:02:02.117
Anyway, I understand
you all got a

01:02:02.119 --> 01:02:04.720
real high-quality prover item,
is that right?

01:02:04.722 --> 01:02:07.689
- Yes, sir.
- Yeah, we got a sword. Yeah.

01:02:07.691 --> 01:02:09.891
A sword. Alright, well, let's
take a look at it.

01:02:09.893 --> 01:02:11.527
- Who am I dealing with? Who's in charge?
- Oh, right here.

01:02:11.528 --> 01:02:13.528
Oh, that'd be me, I think.
Oh, come on.

01:02:13.530 --> 01:02:16.665
Sorry, I only deal one on one,
so you're gonna have to figure it out.

01:02:16.667 --> 01:02:18.567
Oh, well, then, that'd be me,
s... sir.

01:02:18.569 --> 01:02:20.503
I know the guy, I made the deal,
I talked to him...

01:02:20.504 --> 01:02:24.306
Honeysuckle, what are you doing? You know
I'm the mouthpiece of this operation.

01:02:24.308 --> 01:02:26.641
Yeah, not... not really, dear,
You just, you know..

01:02:26.643 --> 01:02:31.279
Alright. You know what, I don't, I don't wanna
be a witness to any, uh, marital discord

01:02:31.281 --> 01:02:33.548
so I... I'll deal with both of
you at the same time

01:02:33.550 --> 01:02:36.318
provided you're willing to hand
over the heater, ma'am.

01:02:36.320 --> 01:02:38.520
Oh, Jesus.

01:02:38.522 --> 01:02:40.555
There you go. Thank you.

01:02:40.557 --> 01:02:44.025
Now, you can both come on up,
just grab the sword. Screendoor!

01:02:45.796 --> 01:02:47.629
Right this way.

01:02:50.100 --> 01:02:52.167
- Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa!
- What?

01:02:52.169 --> 01:02:54.504
It's a screwdriver, you have a gun.
Can I just see if it's mine?

01:02:54.505 --> 01:02:57.773
Can you just hold on a minute?

01:02:57.775 --> 01:03:02.744
Holy shit. It's not mine. That's
awkward. I thought it was mine.

01:03:02.746 --> 01:03:05.514
Move it.

01:03:08.018 --> 01:03:10.485
Door!

01:03:10.487 --> 01:03:14.923
Door! Fuck, dude, honestly.

01:03:14.925 --> 01:03:18.794
Keep your eye on them and stab
'em with somethin' if they move.

01:03:20.130 --> 01:03:22.097
Keep it hard, Door.

01:03:25.903 --> 01:03:28.270
- What's the plan?
- What do you mean what's the plan?

01:03:28.272 --> 01:03:29.472
- We go, we get the money, we leave.
- What's the..

01:03:29.473 --> 01:03:31.140
That's not a plan. Do you know
what a plan..

01:03:31.141 --> 01:03:32.441
But that's, but that's the plan in
place. What are you talkin' about?

01:03:32.442 --> 01:03:34.443
Yeah, but if shit goes upside
down, what is the plan?

01:03:34.444 --> 01:03:36.711
Oh, come on. We..

01:03:36.713 --> 01:03:39.848
Well, we, we can run quickly.
Steal keys and we take the truck.

01:03:39.850 --> 01:03:42.417
You can't outrun a bullet. Now,
what are your strengths?

01:03:42.419 --> 01:03:44.152
Punching or kicking?

01:03:45.622 --> 01:03:47.389
Come on in, y'all.

01:03:50.227 --> 01:03:52.460
You can put that right up here.

01:03:57.301 --> 01:03:59.401
- Have a seat.
- You got it, big man?

01:03:59.403 --> 01:04:02.737
I'm good, Jaws, head on back down
to the truck. Keep an eye on 'em.

01:04:02.739 --> 01:04:04.172
<i>Fair enough.</i>

01:04:05.576 --> 01:04:09.878
Alright, take a look at what we
got here, huh? What's this?

01:04:09.880 --> 01:04:12.647
Uh, those are authenticating
papers.

01:04:12.649 --> 01:04:15.217
Okay.

01:04:15.219 --> 01:04:17.018
'81.

01:04:17.020 --> 01:04:18.186
Yeah.

01:04:18.188 --> 01:04:19.321
That's the year, right?

01:04:19.323 --> 01:04:20.889
Oh, that's the year.

01:04:20.891 --> 01:04:24.226
Yeah, that's good.
Alright, '81. Yeah.

01:04:24.228 --> 01:04:25.895
What have we got here? Ah, look
at this old picture.

01:04:25.896 --> 01:04:27.829
Yeah, you know that picture.

01:04:27.831 --> 01:04:28.931
Look at Lee, he's a man.
He cuts a man's figure, right?

01:04:28.932 --> 01:04:30.266
- Yeah, that's..
- Yeah. Nice beard.

01:04:30.267 --> 01:04:31.399
Mm-mm. Mm-mm. Yummy.

01:04:31.401 --> 01:04:33.735
Look at McClellan.
He's wearin' a dress.

01:04:33.737 --> 01:04:35.270
- Oh! Heh-heh!
- Look at him.

01:04:35.272 --> 01:04:37.372
- What a sis.
- Well, I..

01:04:37.374 --> 01:04:41.009
I think that was just the way the jacket
was cut 'cause doesn't Lee have a..

01:04:41.011 --> 01:04:44.212
No! No, no, no, no, no, that,
that ain't Lee's jacket.

01:04:44.214 --> 01:04:46.081
- No, that's a table cloth.
- Shh.

01:04:46.083 --> 01:04:50.318
Painter just fucked up and didn't paint
the top of the table the same color.

01:04:50.320 --> 01:04:51.786
<i>Idiots.</i>

01:04:58.595 --> 01:05:01.763
Oh, my gosh, I thought I just saw
something move in the distance.

01:05:01.765 --> 01:05:04.466
But it's just..
I think it's the breeze.

01:05:04.468 --> 01:05:07.402
Ever think you see like,
like a ghost?

01:05:07.404 --> 01:05:08.905
Like something in
the corner of your eye?

01:05:08.906 --> 01:05:11.539
Yeah, you're just like,
whoa!

01:05:11.541 --> 01:05:13.708
I've never seen a real ghost,
though.

01:05:13.710 --> 01:05:17.045
I've never seen, like, a real
ghost or anything like that.

01:05:17.047 --> 01:05:18.914
I saw one for the first time
last week.

01:05:18.916 --> 01:05:20.449
- You're kidding me. You saw one?
- Yeah. I saw one.

01:05:20.450 --> 01:05:24.953
It was late at night and..

01:05:24.955 --> 01:05:27.088
Sitting near, like, our... our

01:05:27.090 --> 01:05:31.359
...our kitchen table was this
woman and she was dressed

01:05:31.361 --> 01:05:35.330
like, in, like,
1970s office wear.

01:05:36.733 --> 01:05:40.535
And I look at her
and she's so panicked.

01:05:40.537 --> 01:05:43.939
And I don't know what to say.
No words are escaping my mouth.

01:05:43.941 --> 01:05:46.541
And she just says,
"Line two, line two."

01:05:46.543 --> 01:05:49.110
- Line two, line two?
- Line two, line two.

01:05:49.112 --> 01:05:52.113
And... and then she just..
I blinked and she was gone.

01:05:54.952 --> 01:05:57.118
Take a look at this.
What have we got here?

01:05:57.120 --> 01:06:02.090
Oh, look at that.
A good balance to it.

01:06:02.092 --> 01:06:06.127
- See that?
- Uh, yeah. I see it. Okay.

01:06:06.129 --> 01:06:10.865
My goodness.
Well, this looks good. Alright.

01:06:10.867 --> 01:06:13.201
How about you all tell me
the history of this sword?

01:06:13.203 --> 01:06:14.337
- Yeah, the story.
- Oh, yeah.

01:06:14.338 --> 01:06:17.806
Uh, so the Union Army
surrounded.

01:06:17.808 --> 01:06:20.108
Uh, they're being generaled by,
uh, Sherman.

01:06:20.110 --> 01:06:21.543
But they're Sheridan..

01:06:21.545 --> 01:06:24.779
Sher... Sherman. So they're
surrounded, they're in trouble.

01:06:24.781 --> 01:06:25.947
<i>Boy, are they ever.</i>

01:06:25.949 --> 01:06:28.049
If things don't go your way
at Chickenfoot

01:06:28.051 --> 01:06:29.517
they don't go your way.

01:06:29.519 --> 01:06:31.052
Alright, they're cornered.

01:06:41.932 --> 01:06:45.000
Out-of-the-box thinking is good.
You know. Just..

01:06:45.002 --> 01:06:46.935
- Out of the box?
- Yeah, you know, ghosts.

01:06:46.937 --> 01:06:48.670
Some people think that's crazy.

01:06:48.672 --> 01:06:51.473
They go, "Uh, well, no, that's
not true. Ghosts don't exist."

01:06:51.475 --> 01:06:55.076
- You know, things that we're fed to believe. Right.
- Right.

01:06:55.078 --> 01:06:57.612
Ghosts don't exist,
the Earth is round.

01:07:01.551 --> 01:07:03.952
Well, the Earth is,
the Earth is round.

01:07:05.756 --> 01:07:07.655
Is it, though?

01:07:10.494 --> 01:07:12.127
Yes.

01:07:12.129 --> 01:07:15.497
And ghosts don't exist.

01:07:15.499 --> 01:07:20.502
Well, I think some people are a
little iffy about ghosts' existence

01:07:20.504 --> 01:07:24.139
but I don't think anyone's iffy
about the world being round.

01:07:24.141 --> 01:07:26.408
- Alright, let me ask you something.
- Alright.

01:07:26.410 --> 01:07:30.645
You ever driven through Kansas
City?

01:07:30.647 --> 01:07:32.148
Thirty-thousand people losing
their lives.

01:07:32.149 --> 01:07:36.151
Thirty-five thousand of 'em.
Uh, sick, uh, cholera.

01:07:36.153 --> 01:07:40.121
- And the typhoid is strong and it's taken on..
- Chlamydia.

01:07:40.123 --> 01:07:43.158
- ...more than they bargained for and..
- Deer ticks.

01:07:43.160 --> 01:07:46.061
- They don't have enough people to..
- And you know this battle.

01:07:46.063 --> 01:07:48.696
- This is the Battle of Chickafist.
- Chicken Fist is...

01:07:48.698 --> 01:07:51.299
- Chicken Fist is the Indian word. That's right.
- Yeah. Anyway...

01:07:51.301 --> 01:07:53.034
So they're losin'.

01:07:53.036 --> 01:07:57.639
- What are you saying? Are you saying that the Earth is...
- Is flat.

01:07:57.641 --> 01:08:01.042
And I know what, what you're thinking.
I know it sounds kind of funny.

01:08:01.044 --> 01:08:03.045
- No, it just, it's not even that it sounds funny.
- Because..

01:08:03.046 --> 01:08:06.548
- It just kinda sounds crazy.
- What? And yet..

01:08:06.550 --> 01:08:07.982
I mean, don't you think?

01:08:07.984 --> 01:08:11.920
So the sword pretty much proves
that the South won.

01:08:13.957 --> 01:08:16.758
Hm. Alright.

01:08:18.194 --> 01:08:22.796
Well, that's quite a tale. It's
quite a tale you spun me there.

01:08:22.799 --> 01:08:25.301
- Except, I do have a of couple questions for you now.
- Oh, well, you go ahead.

01:08:25.301 --> 01:08:28.368
It seems that, uh, you couldn't
exactly agree on the, uh

01:08:28.371 --> 01:08:30.270
the name of the battle now,
could you?

01:08:30.273 --> 01:08:32.041
Uh, you say it's a Chicken Fist
and then you say Chicken Fest

01:08:32.042 --> 01:08:36.578
and someone threw in a
Chickenfoot in there somewhere

01:08:36.580 --> 01:08:39.981
which I happen to know
is a super group with, uh

01:08:39.983 --> 01:08:42.118
Sammy Hagar and, uh, Joe Satriani.
So I'm pretty sure it's not Chickenfoot.

01:08:42.118 --> 01:08:44.819
- Really?
- Maybe that's why I had it in mind.

01:08:44.821 --> 01:08:48.857
Maybe that's why you had it in there 'cause
you're a big fan. Perhaps that's it, anyway.

01:08:48.859 --> 01:08:50.593
And then you couldn't settle on
the general's name.

01:08:50.594 --> 01:08:52.694
One of you say Sherman,
one of you say Sheridan.

01:08:52.696 --> 01:08:56.363
And you couldn't settle on whether
it's typhoid or chlamydia or cholera.

01:08:56.366 --> 01:08:58.533
So I think you know where I'm
going with all this.

01:08:58.535 --> 01:09:02.237
Not to mention the first shot
across my bow which you fired

01:09:02.238 --> 01:09:05.340
referring to that army
as the Union Army

01:09:05.341 --> 01:09:07.908
rather than the
army of Northern Aggressors.

01:09:07.911 --> 01:09:11.212
Are we just supposed to believe
everything that's been fed to us

01:09:11.214 --> 01:09:13.615
from the time we were a little
kid to now?

01:09:13.617 --> 01:09:17.519
You have to question these things and that's
a problem is that no one's questioning.

01:09:17.520 --> 01:09:20.188
No one's going out and being
like, maybe this isn't true

01:09:20.189 --> 01:09:22.825
because they're too scared or they
don't wanna know the actual truth.

01:09:22.826 --> 01:09:27.162
- Right.
- And I swear, I was exactly where you were a year ago.

01:09:27.163 --> 01:09:29.796
Okay, say you're,
you're a ship in the ocean.

01:09:29.799 --> 01:09:31.433
- Right. Listening.
- Wouldn't you just fall right off?

01:09:31.434 --> 01:09:32.767
Great question.

01:09:32.769 --> 01:09:35.336
- Honestly, great question, Cynthia.
- Thank you.

01:09:35.337 --> 01:09:39.407
I'm gonna give you one last
chance here, one last chance

01:09:39.408 --> 01:09:42.977
to tell me the truth because
I don't think that you believe.

01:09:42.979 --> 01:09:46.046
I think you believe in what the
history books are written.

01:09:46.049 --> 01:09:48.883
And I'm gonna give you one final
chance unless you want to spend

01:09:48.885 --> 01:09:51.953
all of eternity downstairs
in my toy room

01:09:51.955 --> 01:09:54.689
takin' a real close look
at my collection.

01:09:54.691 --> 01:09:58.660
You tell me right now,
motherfuckers, do you believe or not?

01:09:58.662 --> 01:10:00.029
- Yes. Yes. Yes, a hundred percent. Yes.
- I... I don't. I..

01:10:00.030 --> 01:10:02.096
We don't believe.
There's no.. We don't..

01:10:02.098 --> 01:10:03.899
- This is real, this is very important.
- Come on, Mary, Mary, Mary.

01:10:03.900 --> 01:10:06.367
- And it's real and I believe it!
- Mary, it's over.

01:10:06.369 --> 01:10:08.703
It's over, the guy knows,
he saw through it.

01:10:08.705 --> 01:10:11.440
I don't wanna die in the toy room.
I don't wanna play games with swords.

01:10:11.441 --> 01:10:14.710
I don't know what this sicko wants to do to
us. I don't wanna die here, that's all, okay?

01:10:14.711 --> 01:10:16.544
- You're such a..
- What?

01:10:16.546 --> 01:10:19.113
I just.. We just, we just want
to sell the sword.

01:10:19.115 --> 01:10:22.350
That's it. And we don't care that,
that, that what you believe it's..

01:10:22.352 --> 01:10:23.752
- What you believe is great...
- Everyone believes what they believe.

01:10:23.753 --> 01:10:25.354
- Fine, we just..
- Yeah, please. We made a mistake.

01:10:25.355 --> 01:10:28.122
I'm starting to believe this
stuff myself, so you know what

01:10:28.124 --> 01:10:29.958
we just wanted money,
but we don't even..

01:10:29.960 --> 01:10:31.961
- I don't need the money.
- We don't even need the money.

01:10:31.962 --> 01:10:34.529
We just wanna go. We just wanna
go. We just wanna go home.

01:10:34.531 --> 01:10:37.066
- I just wanna go home. I.. Walk outta here.
- Yeah, I don't wanna die..

01:10:37.067 --> 01:10:38.167
I don't wanna d..
I don't wanna die here.

01:10:38.168 --> 01:10:40.168
I really wanna go home.

01:10:44.140 --> 01:10:48.610
Oh, fuck, he's gonna kill us.
He's gonna fuckin' kill us.

01:10:48.612 --> 01:10:51.579
Look, this has been fun.
This has been..

01:10:51.581 --> 01:10:53.348
It's only gonna get better.
Ha-ha-ha!

01:10:53.350 --> 01:10:56.985
- Freakin' toy-room time.
- Ha-ha-ha!

01:10:56.987 --> 01:10:59.088
- I got somethin' in here for both of you.
- Oh, come on.

01:10:59.089 --> 01:11:02.624
- I got a little somethin' in here.
- Come on. Al... alright.

01:11:02.626 --> 01:11:05.126
Oh, man! Let's see,
ten, twenty..

01:11:05.128 --> 01:11:07.395
- Oh, shit.
- Is that money for us?

01:11:07.397 --> 01:11:10.031
- I'm sorry. What's.. What's... what's..
- Oh, here you go.

01:11:11.901 --> 01:11:12.934
- For us?
- That's for us?

01:11:12.936 --> 01:11:16.037
Oh! Take it.

01:11:16.039 --> 01:11:18.406
Don't touch that fuckin'..
I'm just kidding.

01:11:22.979 --> 01:11:26.314
Oh, shit. Listen.

01:11:28.685 --> 01:11:33.221
I don't believe any of this South
won the Civil War shit, either, okay?

01:11:33.223 --> 01:11:34.622
Come again?

01:11:35.458 --> 01:11:37.959
It's a 200-foot wall of ice

01:11:37.961 --> 01:11:40.895
that surrounds
the entire rim of..

01:11:40.897 --> 01:11:42.363
Actually, hold on.

01:11:42.365 --> 01:11:46.100
I don't know why I'm talkin'
about this, I can show you.

01:11:46.102 --> 01:11:49.203
So there you go, there's the
outer rim, okay

01:11:49.205 --> 01:11:51.139
and, that's a 200-foot ice-wall,
right?

01:11:51.141 --> 01:11:54.075
- Mm-hmm.
- There's the sun and the moon which is actually in...

01:11:54.077 --> 01:11:55.910
- The tennis ball is the sun.
- Yeah.

01:11:55.912 --> 01:11:57.613
- And the golf ball's the moon.
- The golf ball's the moon.

01:11:57.614 --> 01:12:01.349
And what you're seeing, okay,
that is within the firmament.

01:12:01.351 --> 01:12:03.185
- What's the.. Where's the firmament?
- Because what..

01:12:03.186 --> 01:12:04.819
The firmament is actually..

01:12:04.821 --> 01:12:06.889
Here, I'll show you another
picture, you'll be able to see it.

01:12:06.890 --> 01:12:08.490
- But that's, that's a firmament.
- Oh! Is that a soul bowl?

01:12:08.491 --> 01:12:10.325
It's a wrong one
'cause you can't actually..

01:12:10.327 --> 01:12:12.994
Yeah, it's a big soul bowl that
my mom got from Hobby Lobby.

01:12:12.996 --> 01:12:15.563
- You gotta be fuckin' kidding me.
- Wait. Are you kiddin' me?

01:12:15.565 --> 01:12:17.366
- Are you serious right now?
<i>- No, I'm not kidding you.</i>

01:12:17.367 --> 01:12:21.636
These people pass these stories along and
then the next generation believes it.

01:12:21.638 --> 01:12:22.671
And the next thing you know, the
thing grows wings and it flies!

01:12:22.672 --> 01:12:24.872
- Oh. Right, right, right.
<i>- Right.</i>

01:12:24.874 --> 01:12:26.774
And it gets bigger than anybody
can control.

01:12:26.776 --> 01:12:28.777
So I thought, well, I got the
money, I got the resources.

01:12:28.778 --> 01:12:31.813
- I can start collecting this stuff. I put it away somewhere.
- Yeah.

01:12:31.815 --> 01:12:35.183
- And they'll never find it and then all it is is legend.
- That's crazy!

01:12:35.185 --> 01:12:37.785
Man, I knew you were lying to me
the whole damn time, man.

01:12:37.787 --> 01:12:40.621
Hold on now, Jaws. Just, just
give it a second now.

01:12:40.623 --> 01:12:42.056
Hiya!

01:12:42.058 --> 01:12:45.059
Ah! Goddammit, that thing is..

01:12:45.061 --> 01:12:47.295
It's dull, but it hurts.

01:12:47.297 --> 01:12:49.831
Ah! What is wrong with you?

01:12:49.833 --> 01:12:53.334
Get up. Stand up.
Stand up, asshole.

01:12:53.336 --> 01:12:55.771
- Alright, okay, okay, just, just put the gun down.
- No, no, no, no, no.

01:12:55.772 --> 01:12:59.073
- Let's talk.
- No, the gun stays up. This man lyin' to you.

01:12:59.075 --> 01:13:02.477
Y'all been taken to the
cleaners. This is real, man.

01:13:02.479 --> 01:13:04.145
You believe this son of a bitch?

01:13:04.147 --> 01:13:06.180
<i>You've been trying to cause,
big man</i>

01:13:06.182 --> 01:13:10.284
<i>you've been trying to cause an
assault under your own feet, big man.</i>

01:13:10.286 --> 01:13:11.819
<i>How many years
I worked for you?</i>

01:13:11.821 --> 01:13:14.355
Go on to Google,
put in flat Earth.

01:13:14.357 --> 01:13:17.625
There's a, a great 121 questions
about flat Earth.

01:13:17.627 --> 01:13:20.261
- Right. Wow.
- It is undeniable.

01:13:20.263 --> 01:13:23.264
- Yeah.
- I mean, I'll look it up. I..

01:13:23.266 --> 01:13:24.665
Uh-huh.

01:13:24.667 --> 01:13:27.502
I never heard any.. Oh, shit!

01:13:27.504 --> 01:13:29.704
- What?
- I gotta go.

01:13:29.706 --> 01:13:32.573
You gotta go?

01:13:32.575 --> 01:13:34.742
Am I the only one
that didn't bring a gun?

01:13:37.547 --> 01:13:40.548
Goddammit, you mean,
laughs we had, Lincoln's gay.

01:13:40.550 --> 01:13:43.151
Look at old Abe Lincoln
with his Marfan syndrome.

01:13:43.153 --> 01:13:46.020
That's what he had!
That's what he had.

01:13:46.022 --> 01:13:49.190
The big nose and the big feet.
It's on the fuckin' Internet

01:13:49.192 --> 01:13:51.592
and is indisputable scientific
fuckin' proof.

01:13:51.594 --> 01:13:54.362
I don't know. Come on, Nathaniel,
I don't like doing this.

01:13:54.364 --> 01:13:56.964
- Get in the fuckin' truck. I'm so sorry.
- Oh, my gosh! Okay.

01:13:56.966 --> 01:13:58.500
- Get in the fuckin' truck, Nathaniel!
- Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

01:13:58.501 --> 01:14:00.301
- Get in the fuckin' truck!
- I'm in. I'm in.

01:14:00.303 --> 01:14:03.271
I'm sorry, can you pull..
I got it.

01:14:03.273 --> 01:14:04.873
- Okay, do you want me to get it?
- No, it won't go.

01:14:04.874 --> 01:14:07.241
Can you just, can you pull it
down please, Nathaniel?

01:14:07.243 --> 01:14:11.279
- Thank you so much. Pull it..
- Alright. Ah!

01:14:11.281 --> 01:14:14.415
- Alright.
<i>- Okay?</i>

01:14:14.417 --> 01:14:15.716
Alright, thank you.

01:14:15.718 --> 01:14:18.085
<i>You're welcome.</i>

01:14:25.895 --> 01:14:28.729
Are you like the puppet master, man?
You're like a puppet master!

01:14:28.731 --> 01:14:31.166
You're like the Confederate puppet
master. You pull the strings.

01:14:31.167 --> 01:14:32.534
- You want to dance, puppet?
- No, I don't want to dance..

01:14:32.535 --> 01:14:34.036
You know what, I want you to
dance like a puppet.

01:14:34.037 --> 01:14:36.704
- I don't want to dance..
- Give me a puppet dance.

01:14:36.706 --> 01:14:39.540
That's it. Keep dancin', man.
That's a funny puppet dance.

01:14:39.542 --> 01:14:40.808
- You like to dance?
- Oh..

01:14:40.810 --> 01:14:43.311
Why don't you fuckin' dance like
you're on a cartoon?

01:14:43.313 --> 01:14:46.714
Put a pie in the oven!
Put a apple pie in the oven.

01:14:46.716 --> 01:14:49.317
Bake it nice and put a nice
crust on it and take the fork

01:14:49.319 --> 01:14:51.652
and make those notches in 'em
like grandma did.

01:14:51.654 --> 01:14:52.820
Now, what about you?

01:14:52.822 --> 01:14:54.956
Mr. Puppet Master?
You wanna dance, too?

01:14:54.958 --> 01:14:56.290
Dance like a donkey.

01:14:56.292 --> 01:14:57.925
Dance like a funny donkey.

01:14:57.927 --> 01:15:00.728
Dance like a funny donkey,
you jackass!

01:15:00.730 --> 01:15:02.897
That's my boy.
Dance like a donkey.

01:15:02.899 --> 01:15:04.999
Now turn around 'cause someone
gonna eat it.

01:15:05.001 --> 01:15:06.467
They're gonna eat some lead.

01:15:06.469 --> 01:15:07.969
- Turn around, man.
- Hold on.

01:15:07.971 --> 01:15:09.371
- Man, turn that around.
- Hold on, Jaws.

01:15:09.372 --> 01:15:11.540
- You don't have to do this.
- I'm not gonna hold my nut.

01:15:11.541 --> 01:15:13.107
- Jaws.
- Turn around.

01:15:13.109 --> 01:15:14.442
Don't.. You don't have to do
this.

01:15:14.444 --> 01:15:16.311
I know, I don't gotta do,
but I'm gonna fuckin' do.

01:15:16.312 --> 01:15:18.247
- Why don't you fuckin' turn around, man, huh?
- Okay.

01:15:18.248 --> 01:15:19.780
On the count of three..

01:15:19.782 --> 01:15:23.017
I'm gonna start stabbin'
and shootin'.

01:15:23.019 --> 01:15:25.720
One, two..

01:15:25.722 --> 01:15:27.321
Wha..

01:15:28.992 --> 01:15:31.592
Hey, where is the bathroom?

01:15:33.530 --> 01:15:36.297
- The fuck..
- Surprise gun!

01:15:36.299 --> 01:15:37.698
<i>- Oh, thank God.</i>
- Oh, my God.

01:15:37.700 --> 01:15:39.835
Now I'm the puppet master,
and you are boy with the pies.

01:15:39.836 --> 01:15:44.405
And the pie's full of bullet
holes, you motherfucker!

01:15:44.407 --> 01:15:45.574
- Oh..
- Give me the sword and give her the gun!

01:15:45.575 --> 01:15:46.808
- The gun, get the gun.
- Give me this.

01:15:46.809 --> 01:15:48.709
- Alright.
- Give me the sword!

01:15:48.711 --> 01:15:50.177
Give, give me the screwdriver.

01:15:50.179 --> 01:15:53.147
He wants his screwdriver.
Give him the driver.

01:15:53.149 --> 01:15:54.716
Alright, Mary, get your eyes
on that one.

01:15:54.717 --> 01:15:56.083
Okay, no, no, Cynthia..

01:15:56.085 --> 01:15:57.352
- You're gonna die, motherfucker!
- No, he's good.

01:15:57.353 --> 01:15:58.487
- Honey, no, no, wait.
- Take the motherfucker..

01:15:58.488 --> 01:15:59.687
Wait, wait! Cynthia,

01:15:59.689 --> 01:16:00.923
- He's great. He sucks.
- Good guy.

01:16:00.924 --> 01:16:02.223
He's great. He sucks.

01:16:02.225 --> 01:16:03.258
- You get over here.
- We'll... we'll tell you later.

01:16:03.259 --> 01:16:04.326
- Get over here.
- I'm so sorry, then.

01:16:04.327 --> 01:16:05.660
No.
No, it's fine. It's fine.

01:16:05.662 --> 01:16:07.362
- I feel awful. I didn't mean that.
- I... I get it.

01:16:07.363 --> 01:16:09.531
- I don't usually use those words.
- Just because.. Shut up.

01:16:09.532 --> 01:16:12.733
I'm comin' around now, a
carousel full of bullets.

01:16:12.735 --> 01:16:14.502
- Come on.
- Oh, God.

01:16:14.504 --> 01:16:16.204
- Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
- Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

01:16:16.205 --> 01:16:17.439
- You're okay?
- You did so good. You did so great.

01:16:17.440 --> 01:16:19.607
- I was so worried.
- Bartholomew!

01:16:19.609 --> 01:16:21.809
Sturgis, get in here!

01:16:23.179 --> 01:16:26.614
- Time for you to..
- Oh, yeah?

01:16:26.616 --> 01:16:28.783
Take this sack of shit down
to the toy room.

01:16:28.785 --> 01:16:30.451
- Oh, shit!
- There's really a toy room?

01:16:30.453 --> 01:16:32.887
Oh, yeah. We'll have a little
play time with you later.

01:16:32.889 --> 01:16:34.723
You just hope you sleep well
tonight in your bed of lies.

01:16:34.724 --> 01:16:38.459
I will. I'll be, I'll be sleepin'
tuckered out after whoopin' your ass.

01:16:38.461 --> 01:16:40.394
- Asshole!
- Out you go.

01:16:40.396 --> 01:16:42.264
So where'd you get the guns?
How did you pull this off?

01:16:42.265 --> 01:16:43.966
What are you,
like secret agents or somethin'?

01:16:43.967 --> 01:16:47.068
Oh, no. Mary was in the Israeli army.
She taught me a few things, too.

01:16:47.070 --> 01:16:48.903
- Oh, okay. Of course, she was.
- Oh..

01:16:48.905 --> 01:16:50.404
And we finally got to
use our watches.

01:16:50.406 --> 01:16:51.706
I know. You did so good.

01:16:51.708 --> 01:16:53.541
Because I thought,
she's gonna forget to look.

01:16:53.543 --> 01:16:55.377
- 'Cause you know sometimes...
- No, I never looked.

01:16:55.378 --> 01:16:57.578
But it was buzzin'.
At first I thought it was a bee

01:16:57.580 --> 01:16:59.847
I looked down, I was like,
"Oh, Mary's talking to me."

01:16:59.849 --> 01:17:02.416
Said S-O-S with a little gun
emoji. I knew what that meant.

01:17:02.418 --> 01:17:05.453
- You did so good.
- Mm, so I put Nathaniel in the back of the van.

01:17:05.455 --> 01:17:07.155
- 'Cause you told me not to trust him.
- That's right.

01:17:07.156 --> 01:17:08.956
- No offense.
- No, I get it.

01:17:08.958 --> 01:17:11.325
But then I was walkin' away
and he started hummin'.

01:17:11.327 --> 01:17:14.395
- Ugh!
- And I felt so bad, I was like, bless his heart.

01:17:14.397 --> 01:17:16.030
That's one reaction.

01:17:16.032 --> 01:17:19.967
Okay, well, let's give it up
for him. Where is he?

01:17:19.969 --> 01:17:23.070
- Oh, my God. Oh, it's sad.
- Hey, buddy.

01:17:23.072 --> 01:17:24.640
- Oh, no.
- There he is, standin' out there.

01:17:24.641 --> 01:17:26.173
Hello! Hey, get in here!
High-five!

01:17:26.175 --> 01:17:28.175
- Hey, oh, alright.
- Up top!

01:17:28.177 --> 01:17:29.711
- What are you, what are you doin' out there?
- You did it!

01:17:29.712 --> 01:17:31.513
- I was waiting for you guys to open the..
- You did it!

01:17:31.514 --> 01:17:33.481
I did it?
Oh, good. It worked?

01:17:33.483 --> 01:17:35.316
- Yeah.
- Oh, my gosh.

01:17:35.318 --> 01:17:36.718
- The knocking..
- With the knocking at the perfect time, right? Two..

01:17:36.719 --> 01:17:38.719
- In three, two, and then..
- Ugh..

01:17:38.721 --> 01:17:39.821
- And then I was like, uh..
- Oh, then I thought you did..

01:17:39.822 --> 01:17:40.921
Pow-pow-pow! Oh, good.

01:17:40.923 --> 01:17:43.891
I said somethin' really cool,
too.

01:17:43.893 --> 01:17:47.762
Yeah. Alright, well.
You folks are free to go.

01:17:47.764 --> 01:17:50.331
- Here's your money. I'll just, uh..
- Alright. Thank you.

01:17:50.333 --> 01:17:52.433
Take my sword.
So let's, uh..

01:17:52.435 --> 01:17:54.935
- Alright.
- Put this here.

01:17:54.937 --> 01:17:57.405
- Alright.
- Put it right there.

01:17:57.407 --> 01:18:00.441
Goodbye. Oh.

01:18:01.711 --> 01:18:03.210
Oh.. Alright.

01:18:03.212 --> 01:18:04.679
- Yeah.
<i>- Let go of it.</i>

01:18:04.681 --> 01:18:05.847
- Here we go.
- He's got the cloth there for you.

01:18:05.848 --> 01:18:08.883
And just..
Let's put it right.. No.

01:18:08.885 --> 01:18:10.217
Now there, what's happening?

01:18:10.219 --> 01:18:11.819
What are you, teasing him?

01:18:11.821 --> 01:18:13.954
- No, I just, um..
<i>- Just let it go.</i>

01:18:13.956 --> 01:18:15.790
- Alright.
- Paid a lot of money for it.

01:18:15.792 --> 01:18:17.591
Okay. Just gonna let go of it
this time.

01:18:17.593 --> 01:18:19.293
- Yeah.
- Here we go. No, no, no, no, no.

01:18:19.295 --> 01:18:20.828
- Honey, honey, honey, you okay?
- Wow!

01:18:20.830 --> 01:18:24.965
- I.. No, I don't think..
- What's goin' on?

01:18:24.967 --> 01:18:29.637
I'm so sorry, y'all.
I just.. Wow!

01:18:29.639 --> 01:18:31.839
This was my grandpappy's sword.

01:18:31.841 --> 01:18:33.340
Your racist grandpappy?

01:18:33.342 --> 01:18:37.812
Well, I don't agree
with his morals

01:18:37.814 --> 01:18:40.347
or his ideas when it comes to
the Civil War

01:18:40.349 --> 01:18:42.817
but he was a good man.

01:18:42.819 --> 01:18:47.121
<i>He would take care of me every night
when my daddy would go to work.</i>

01:18:47.123 --> 01:18:50.091
And he would
tuck me in and

01:18:50.093 --> 01:18:53.260
and pretend to fall asleep next
to me, read me stories and..

01:18:53.262 --> 01:18:55.429
Oh, we had this song.
We had this song..

01:18:55.431 --> 01:18:58.632
...we made it up together.

01:18:58.634 --> 01:19:01.769
I didn't remember it
until this moment.

01:20:06.502 --> 01:20:09.170
Goddammit, it means the world
to me, sweetie.

01:20:09.172 --> 01:20:10.938
- I love you so much.
- I love you.

01:20:10.940 --> 01:20:12.807
Love you. Love you so much.

01:20:12.809 --> 01:20:14.642
You know what? Deal's off.

01:20:14.644 --> 01:20:18.179
I get it. It's family.
Family is very important.

01:20:18.181 --> 01:20:21.081
It's the last you have of him,
I... I understand.

01:20:21.083 --> 01:20:22.516
You're not upset?

01:20:22.518 --> 01:20:24.418
No, no, I'm not upset. Look.

01:20:24.420 --> 01:20:27.354
Why don't we put it in this
scabbard, I'll wrap it up for you?

01:20:27.356 --> 01:20:31.725
You all can be on your way.
Here you go.

01:20:31.727 --> 01:20:32.860
- Here we go.
- Wow.

01:20:32.862 --> 01:20:35.863
- It's okay.
- What a strange experience.

01:20:35.865 --> 01:20:39.033
Yes, it was a strange experience.
A strange, horrible experience.

01:20:39.035 --> 01:20:40.569
I mean, we went through a lot
to get to here.

01:20:40.570 --> 01:20:41.735
- Yeah.
- That's right.

01:20:41.737 --> 01:20:43.637
- And I..
- You just fucked it all up.

01:20:43.639 --> 01:20:44.872
- Yup.
- I got myself a sword.

01:20:44.874 --> 01:20:45.907
- Yeah.
- Oh, good for you.

01:20:45.908 --> 01:20:47.908
Yup. You had it the whole time.

01:20:47.910 --> 01:20:50.010
So..

01:20:50.012 --> 01:20:54.481
Alright. So, I guess, uh..

01:20:54.483 --> 01:20:56.083
Here's the money.

01:20:58.120 --> 01:21:00.087
<i>Alright then.</i>

01:21:00.089 --> 01:21:04.024
There we go.
Now, you can have this.

01:21:04.026 --> 01:21:06.527
But I do need one thing
from you.

01:21:06.529 --> 01:21:09.396
Young lady, I need a promise..

01:21:09.398 --> 01:21:12.900
That you'll guard and protect
this sword with your life

01:21:12.902 --> 01:21:17.805
make sure it never falls into the wrong
hands to be used for nefarious purposes.

01:21:17.807 --> 01:21:20.474
Keep it away from those who would
use it to do harm to others.

01:21:20.476 --> 01:21:22.710
- Yes, sir.
- Make me that promise.

01:21:22.712 --> 01:21:24.078
I promise you.

01:21:24.080 --> 01:21:26.780
Alright. Go in peace.

01:21:26.782 --> 01:21:31.018
- And also with you.
- Alright. Get outta here. Wait.

01:21:31.020 --> 01:21:35.256
One more thing, you need a way to
get outta here, keys to the van.

01:21:35.258 --> 01:21:37.291
Take it and go.

01:21:37.293 --> 01:21:38.726
Are you gonna kill us?

01:21:38.728 --> 01:21:40.861
- No.
- Someone gonna follow us?

01:21:40.863 --> 01:21:44.265
No. I want you to get outta here.
I got a date in the toy room.

01:21:44.267 --> 01:21:46.166
<i>- Thank you, boss man.</i>
- You're welcome.

01:21:46.168 --> 01:21:49.003
<i>Go. Come on, Mel.</i>

01:22:27.343 --> 01:22:30.177
- Hey, Mel.
- Yeah?

01:22:30.179 --> 01:22:31.578
Look.

01:22:35.818 --> 01:22:38.018
Isn't that Deidre's car?

01:22:42.892 --> 01:22:43.892
Yup.

01:25:36.065 --> 01:25:40.934
<i>One, two..
One, two, three..</i>
