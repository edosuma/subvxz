You're a lesbian

We shouldn't be here.

03:18.231 --> 03:19.965
Do you have any idea
who would have done this?

03:19.967 --> 03:21.833
My husband is a psychiatrist.

03:21.835 --> 03:23.969
He has a number
of very troubled patients.

03:23.971 --> 03:25.270
You could search his laptop.

this is a good one.

04:38.645 --> 04:40.712

sounds like "tie"?

do something like this?

We already did that one.

05:05.339 --> 05:06.305
And it was a shitty idea.

05:06.472 --> 05:07.639
We lost 14 million on it.

and eat you for dinner.

in the middle of something.

Hey, Miss Ensler,
I know you're still grieving,

05:40.607 --> 05:42.874
but I want
your honest opinion, okay.

05:43.042 --> 05:44.876
Do you think I should have
a line of neckties?

-Michael!

named Charles Scurb.

Hey, Miss Ensler, have you
ever heard of a Charles Scurb?

06:06.734 --> 06:09.568
He keeps all his patient
files locked in his office.

06:09.570 --> 06:12.070
Um, do you happen
to have the keys?

06:12.072 --> 06:13.905
No, he always has them.

06:13.907 --> 06:15.474
They're probably
in his pocket.

going back in there.

-Mmm-mmm.

is calling the police.

Oh, whoops!

09:23.162 --> 09:25.664
I'm gonna take Mrs. Ensler
home with me.

09:25.666 --> 09:28.433
What?
Mike, did you get the fax?

09:28.435 --> 09:30.769
-Yeah, now what do I do?
-You sign it and fax it back.

09:33.406 --> 09:34.406
What is happening?

09:34.408 --> 09:37.509
Chainsaw Charlie is taking
Miss Ensler to his house.

09:37.511 --> 09:39.744
-What?
-Do you have
his address in that file?

09:39.746 --> 09:41.479
Yeah.
Yeah, it's right here.

09:42.381 --> 09:44.382
Shit! That's like one block
away from Cost-Lo.

09:44.384 --> 09:46.084
Man, this is our lucky day.

09:46.086 --> 09:50.488
Hold up. We gotta
wait for the confirmation.

09:58.464 --> 09:59.531
(FAX MACHINE BEEPS)

10:01.567 --> 10:03.835
Okay.
To the Mystery Mobile!

10:05.071 --> 10:07.539
MARQUESS: <i> So, we're still</i>
<i>not calling the police?</i>

10:07.773 --> 10:09.407
It's not even
a mystery anymore.

10:09.409 --> 10:12.477
He's the killer.
I mean, honestly...

10:12.479 --> 10:14.112
(MRS. ENSLER SCREAMING)

10:20.086 --> 10:23.488
Hey! Put that down,
you dumb (BLEEP) lunatic!

10:23.789 --> 10:25.490
(CHAINSAW WHIRRING)

10:28.995 --> 10:30.729
(GROANING)

10:33.899 --> 10:35.467
What the hell was that?

10:35.469 --> 10:37.068
It's the Mike Ty-Stun Gun.

10:37.503 --> 10:39.871
It's the only one ever made.
We couldn't get any investors.

10:40.139 --> 10:42.407
Deezy, Deezy, Deezy...

10:49.682 --> 10:52.851
Do we have a blanket or
something for this poor woman?

10:54.620 --> 10:55.754
Okay.

11:02.428 --> 11:03.895
I'm a sex addict.
