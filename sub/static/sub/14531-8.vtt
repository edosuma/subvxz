WEBVTT

00:41.371 --> 00:44.083
[man] Oh, yeah, the little tiller.

00:44.167 --> 00:46.794
These things are the best.
And I'll tell you why.

00:46.877 --> 00:50.214
One of the things these
do is they cut ground up

00:50.297 --> 00:52.883
- and make it easy for you to shovel...
- What the...?

00:53.926 --> 00:56.679
Hey, Mom? Mom?

00:58.139 --> 01:02.226
Mom? Hey, Mom. Do you have a rototiller?

01:03.853 --> 01:05.938
[in country accent] Well, dang,
the rototiller's in the shop.

01:06.022 --> 01:07.731
You'll have to use my plow.

01:07.815 --> 01:11.443
And don't you forget to put Buttercup
back in the stable when you're done.

01:11.527 --> 01:15.114
Mom, you know, I'm doing all
of this, all of this, for you.

01:15.198 --> 01:19.785
[in normal voice] Yeah, well,
honey... Why are you doing this to me?

01:19.869 --> 01:22.205
- For you.
- What did I say?

01:22.287 --> 01:24.248
[Grace] I'm back from the beach!

01:25.208 --> 01:27.960
Ugh. That boy's gonna help me to death.

01:28.044 --> 01:32.381
If he's going to be here all the time,
can he do something we actually need?

01:32.464 --> 01:34.842
Like get my shoe out from under the bed?

01:34.925 --> 01:36.719
You know what I really need?

01:36.802 --> 01:39.555
A pair of good strong arms
to help me out of the tub.

01:39.638 --> 01:41.431
Of course I'd have to
bathe in a bathing suit.

01:41.515 --> 01:43.100
I can't get clean that way.

01:43.184 --> 01:45.019
I suppose I could buy a bikini,

01:45.102 --> 01:47.104
but I don't want him to
see me in a bikini either.

01:47.188 --> 01:51.817
Maybe Bud needs a nice
mother-son night out on the town.

01:51.901 --> 01:56.113
How about tonight? I bet
there's a Pink Floyd laser show

01:56.197 --> 01:58.241
someplace in San Diego tonight.

01:58.323 --> 02:01.618
Well, first of all, it's
in Bakersfield this week.

02:01.702 --> 02:04.788
And get your feet away from my fruit! No!

02:04.872 --> 02:07.499
And second, I'm not going out.

02:07.583 --> 02:11.336
I'm rehearsing here tonight with
my Tuvan throat-singing group.

02:11.420 --> 02:13.839
[throat-singing noises]

02:15.258 --> 02:16.759
Uh-uh. No. No, you're not.

02:16.842 --> 02:19.511
- I made snacks...
- Please.

02:19.595 --> 02:21.931
I want the house tonight.
You can sleep in your room,

02:22.014 --> 02:24.141
but just stay out of the main house.

02:24.225 --> 02:25.559
Wait. Is tonight the night?

02:25.642 --> 02:27.895
If you mean, "Is Guy coming
over tonight?" then yes.

02:27.978 --> 02:30.022
- For sex?
- For dinner.

02:30.106 --> 02:32.691
- And sex?
- Okay. I'm gonna go to Guy's.

02:32.775 --> 02:34.318
No, no. Do it here.

02:34.401 --> 02:37.154
The girls and I can meet
at Narantsetseg's house.

02:37.238 --> 02:40.074
You have not had sex in a very long time.

02:40.157 --> 02:42.118
- [metal clanging]
- Clang, clang! Bud's out here!

02:42.201 --> 02:43.286
Hearing you ladies!

02:43.368 --> 02:46.122
Wanting to kill himself! Please stop.

02:47.372 --> 02:49.792
[whispering] Can we stop
talking about this now?

02:49.875 --> 02:51.294
Why are you freaking out?

02:51.376 --> 02:53.003
Break down your emotions for me.

02:54.213 --> 02:55.547
Annoyance. Irritation...

02:55.631 --> 02:57.925
No, that's what you're feeling about me.

02:58.008 --> 02:59.426
I'm talking about tonight.

02:59.509 --> 03:02.888
Are you nervous that this will
be the first time in 40 years

03:02.972 --> 03:05.224
that a straight man will see you naked?

03:05.308 --> 03:08.185
No, because the lights'll be off.

03:08.269 --> 03:11.063
Matter of fact, I'm going to turn
off all the lights in San Diego.

03:11.147 --> 03:13.774
What about vaginal dryness?
Are you worried about that?

03:15.234 --> 03:16.610
I am now.

03:18.737 --> 03:22.699
You have two options.
Either Brianna's room...

03:22.783 --> 03:25.410
Why don't I just use the dining room table?

03:25.494 --> 03:27.955
I have all of our wedding
stuff on the dining room table.

03:28.038 --> 03:29.248
I'll use a corner of the den.

03:29.332 --> 03:33.794
Sol. This room would make a perfect office.

03:33.877 --> 03:37.214
- Or I can work from my car.
- What is the problem with Brianna's room?

03:37.298 --> 03:39.466
- Brianna.
- What?

03:39.549 --> 03:43.053
She scares me. Okay? Your
daughter is terrifying.

03:43.137 --> 03:46.974
I don't want to give her any
reason to kill me in my sleep.

03:47.057 --> 03:48.767
[chuckles]

03:48.851 --> 03:50.435
Sol!

03:50.519 --> 03:52.729
And as our bodies age,

03:52.813 --> 03:55.983
our vaginas stop producing
their natural lubricants.

03:57.193 --> 04:00.696
You are just going to keep talking
about my vagina, aren't you?

04:00.779 --> 04:04.867
- I want to show you something.
- No, please, no. [groans]

04:04.950 --> 04:07.119
[laughing]

04:07.203 --> 04:09.997
Oh! You are such a prude.

04:10.080 --> 04:12.208
It's my secret weapon.

04:12.291 --> 04:13.334
No, please, no.

04:13.417 --> 04:16.212
Frankie's homemade yam lube.

04:18.297 --> 04:19.839
- That's a lubricant?!
- Yeah.

04:19.923 --> 04:23.427
- I've been putting that on my toast!
- Well, that's fine, actually.

04:23.510 --> 04:26.805
My gynecologist says you should
not put anything in your vagina

04:26.889 --> 04:29.016
that you would not put in your mouth.

04:29.099 --> 04:33.270
I call it "vagacadabra." I'm
gonna whip you up a batch.

04:33.354 --> 04:37.316
- My yam man is coming today.
- Wait a minute, you have a yam man?

04:37.400 --> 04:42.029
My friend, Jacob. He's an organic grower
and one of my top twelve favorite people.

04:42.112 --> 04:43.322
[sighs]

04:43.406 --> 04:45.490
This is my first time with Guy, okay?

04:45.574 --> 04:49.245
I don't want to break out the
bells and whistles and... yams.

04:49.328 --> 04:54.750
It's not a dildo, honey. It's
a facilitator, that's all.

04:56.543 --> 04:59.213
I also make dildos.

04:59.296 --> 05:01.257
Oh, my God.

05:01.340 --> 05:02.425
Ah... [sniffs]

05:02.507 --> 05:05.219
Oh, God. How do you do it?

05:05.302 --> 05:08.597
Passion. And some really
high quality cow shit.

05:08.680 --> 05:10.766
[laughs]

05:10.849 --> 05:13.936
- What are all these yams for, anyway?
- I'm making a lube for my roommate's...

05:14.019 --> 05:16.980
Car! It's lube for my car.

05:17.064 --> 05:20.359
The... the pistons are...

05:20.443 --> 05:22.527
- It's for my car.
- [chuckles]

05:22.611 --> 05:25.739
- Grace, meet my friend, Jacob.
- Hey.

05:25.822 --> 05:28.700
Frankie has told me so much
about your sweet potato booth.

05:28.784 --> 05:31.620
That's odd, seeing as how I'm a yam man.

05:31.703 --> 05:33.205
[Frankie and Jacob laugh]

05:33.289 --> 05:35.791
- Aren't they the same thing?
- Rookie mistake.

05:35.874 --> 05:39.753
- Vastly different creature.
- See, sweet potatoes are actually dicots.

05:39.836 --> 05:42.798
And the yam is a prime
example of a monocot.

05:42.881 --> 05:45.634
Mm-hmm. God's tuber.

05:45.717 --> 05:48.929
[laughs]

05:49.012 --> 05:50.806
Don't I feel like an idiot.

05:50.889 --> 05:52.599
Well...

06:00.274 --> 06:03.068
Can you make the On Demand happen?

06:03.152 --> 06:05.570
I'm wanting to watch something
with Lee Marvin in it,

06:05.654 --> 06:07.948
but I don't know what the hell I'm doing.

06:08.031 --> 06:09.825
Why don't you get your boyfriend to do it?

06:09.908 --> 06:12.077
- What?
- Mr. Potato Head.

06:12.161 --> 06:14.330
- Who, Jake?
- Yeah.

06:14.413 --> 06:16.165
We're just friends.

06:16.248 --> 06:18.625
Just friends? Seriously?

06:18.708 --> 06:21.170
Adult men and women
can't be "just friends."

06:21.253 --> 06:25.341
Oh, that's ridiculous. I'm
friends with lots of men.

06:25.424 --> 06:29.678
Take my dear friend Tim McGinniss,
who gave me my tribal mate gourds.

06:29.761 --> 06:32.764
There's never been the
slightest suggestion of romance.

06:32.848 --> 06:34.933
Of course, he lost his wang in Korea.

06:35.017 --> 06:36.601
I don't know about your Korean friend.

06:36.685 --> 06:40.230
But I do know that this
"friend" was flirting with you.

06:40.314 --> 06:41.731
"God's tuber."

06:41.815 --> 06:44.527
- [laughs] He was not.
- You know, maybe

06:44.609 --> 06:47.654
if you stop texting your
ex-husband every time you feel sad

06:47.737 --> 06:49.823
or you see a funny looking dog,

06:49.906 --> 06:52.742
maybe you'd see that
this... farmer likes you.

06:52.826 --> 06:56.621
You think? No.

06:56.705 --> 07:00.792
Him? Really? With me? No.

07:00.876 --> 07:06.089
Although I do have my charms.
And a fantastic head of hair.

07:06.173 --> 07:08.384
Oh, but he's a Leo...

07:10.511 --> 07:12.596
[gasps]

07:12.679 --> 07:14.598
Oh, but he's a Leo!

07:17.142 --> 07:19.520
[door opens]

07:19.603 --> 07:20.979
[grunts]

07:23.566 --> 07:25.775
Loretta's service ferret
is in the hall again.

07:25.859 --> 07:27.277
God, I hate his little vest.

07:31.073 --> 07:33.325
- Ow!
- What you doing over there?

07:33.409 --> 07:36.119
Nothing. Just bills.

07:36.203 --> 07:37.538
Ikea sucks.

07:37.621 --> 07:39.456
You don't have any bills
and that's Dad's desk.

07:40.624 --> 07:41.625
[laughs]

07:41.708 --> 07:45.504
Right? I gotta get going.
Marching band rehearsal.

07:45.588 --> 07:46.589
Hmm.

07:47.923 --> 07:50.926
Oh, hey, could you take the
trash with you on your way out?

07:51.009 --> 07:53.554
- I think it's your turn.
- It's whoever leaves first.

07:53.637 --> 07:55.639
And doesn't own the apartment.

07:58.683 --> 08:01.186
- Thanks.
- Yup.

08:19.413 --> 08:22.165
- Forgot my backpack.
- Of course you did.

08:23.750 --> 08:25.294
- What you doing there?
- Hmm?

08:25.377 --> 08:27.170
New workout routine?

08:27.254 --> 08:29.548
Desk lifts?

08:32.551 --> 08:34.678
- Look, man...
- What are you doing with my stuff?

08:34.760 --> 08:38.390
- What are you hiding?
- Come on, give me my drawer.

08:53.614 --> 08:58.285
So, uh... how are you adjusting to...

08:58.368 --> 09:01.705
to life in safe, boring San Diego?

09:01.788 --> 09:05.041
You know, a few years ago I was
doing a piece for National Geographic

09:05.125 --> 09:09.754
in central Africa, and our village
was overrun by Congolese rebels.

09:09.838 --> 09:12.424
So we holed up in this hospital.

09:12.508 --> 09:15.802
And I really thought that
was going to be the end.

09:15.885 --> 09:20.015
But today, trying to get out of
the parking lot at Trader Joe's,

09:20.098 --> 09:22.601
that was the most scared I've
ever been in my entire life.

09:22.685 --> 09:25.145
[laughing]

09:25.228 --> 09:26.522
Ah...

09:31.735 --> 09:33.028
Would you like some more wine?

09:33.111 --> 09:34.863
- Oh, please.
- Yeah.

09:42.412 --> 09:43.747
[clears throat]

09:48.460 --> 09:51.547
You know, they've got an
incredible cheese section there.

09:51.630 --> 09:55.258
It's the only place I can find this
Swedish cheese made from moose milk.

09:55.342 --> 09:57.594
- You wanna have sex?
- Oh, boy, yeah.

10:17.447 --> 10:18.990
[sighs softly]

10:28.417 --> 10:31.836
Ah! Oh, my neck.

10:41.137 --> 10:43.139
[Guy] Grace? Can I come in now?

10:43.223 --> 10:45.183
Wait, just a sec.

10:50.355 --> 10:52.274
Okay!

10:54.484 --> 10:57.529
- Oh, boy, it's dark in here.
- I know.

10:57.613 --> 10:58.905
Um...

10:58.988 --> 11:02.618
I've got a little night blindness.
Could I have a little light maybe?

11:02.701 --> 11:04.202
- Just...
- Okay.

11:04.286 --> 11:08.123
Just one sec. Okay, I'm going to
turn the light on just for one second.

11:08.206 --> 11:10.041
- And you plan your route, okay?
- Okay.

11:10.125 --> 11:11.251
Okay.

11:12.836 --> 11:14.254
- Okay.
- Good.

11:15.422 --> 11:18.508
Just that the old memory
isn't what it used to be, so...

11:18.592 --> 11:21.010
- Follow the sound of my hand.
- Okay.

11:21.094 --> 11:22.137
Ah!

11:22.220 --> 11:26.182
Oh, God. Oh, my God. That... Oh, jeez.

11:31.104 --> 11:33.106
Boy, band practice
must've gone really late.

11:33.189 --> 11:36.067
What do you want, Bud?

11:36.151 --> 11:39.863
I swear to God, I will not put
up with any of your bullshit.

11:39.946 --> 11:43.408
I'm aware that you have a disease,
and that you are recovering,

11:43.492 --> 11:46.244
because there's no such
thing as recovered, however...

11:46.328 --> 11:49.414
Come on, man! My balls?!

11:49.498 --> 11:52.334
If you are using, or
if you are lying to me,

11:52.417 --> 11:55.211
if you're not going to your meetings,
you can just pack up all your stuff

11:55.295 --> 11:57.589
and you can get out of my place
I'm letting you stay for free

11:57.673 --> 11:59.174
out of my love for you.

11:59.257 --> 12:02.969
Are you done? Did you get out
everything you wanted to say?

12:04.596 --> 12:06.931
"No such thing as recovery...
stay for free... love for you..."

12:07.015 --> 12:10.059
- Yeah, I'm good.
- I'm not using.

12:11.060 --> 12:15.315
- I'm not lying to you.
- Then what is going on, man?

12:15.398 --> 12:18.109
Are you sure that you wanna know?

12:18.193 --> 12:20.529
I don't know.

12:20.612 --> 12:22.155
Yes!

12:24.282 --> 12:26.117
[takes a deep breath]

12:29.454 --> 12:31.456
I'm looking for my birth mother.

12:46.596 --> 12:48.557
I knew it!

12:48.640 --> 12:51.142
- Knew what?
- Mussed hair, fancy robe,

12:51.226 --> 12:54.437
vague aura of shame... Night moves!

12:54.521 --> 12:57.065
- All right, all right.
- Tell me everything. How was it?

12:58.983 --> 12:59.860
Ah, ah. Wait.

12:59.943 --> 13:01.862
- No, excuse me.
- Sister, I need details.

13:01.945 --> 13:04.948
Was it good? How long did it last?

13:05.031 --> 13:06.867
You know something? I don't
think this is appropriate.

13:06.950 --> 13:10.370
Did you do it more than once? Is
he a cuddler? Did he cry after?

13:10.453 --> 13:12.622
Did you cry during? Tell me what happened.

13:12.706 --> 13:17.168
Fine. Well... Without going
into too many details...

13:18.336 --> 13:21.506
I will say that Guy is...
no slouch in the boudoir.

13:21.590 --> 13:23.800
How does that feel?

13:23.884 --> 13:25.427
Are you doing anything?

13:25.510 --> 13:27.637
No slouch, okay. What else?

13:27.721 --> 13:30.933
Well, he has a very...

13:32.058 --> 13:33.059
gentle touch.

13:33.142 --> 13:35.478
Ow! Oh, that's my nipple, Guy.

13:35.562 --> 13:37.522
It was a delicate dance, really.

13:37.606 --> 13:40.400
- Are you there yet?
- Where?

13:40.483 --> 13:41.526
Oh, never mind.

13:41.610 --> 13:43.695
Mm-hmm. Not so good, huh?

13:43.779 --> 13:47.741
Overall, I would give
the night a solid B...

13:47.824 --> 13:49.242
Minus.

13:49.325 --> 13:52.203
Mmm. Well, it was your first time.

13:52.287 --> 13:54.247
Tell me, did you finish at least?

13:54.330 --> 13:55.958
I'm here, right? Of course I finished.

13:56.040 --> 13:58.752
No, I'm not asking... I'm
asking did you have an orgasm?

13:58.835 --> 14:01.463
You are such a child.

14:03.089 --> 14:04.633
That's a "no."

14:06.969 --> 14:11.055
Okay, so, the keeper
pile will be over here.

14:11.139 --> 14:13.850
Sol, for the last time,
there is no keeper pile.

14:13.934 --> 14:16.269
That's actually what's on our family crest.

14:20.148 --> 14:22.525
Hang on a minute!

14:22.609 --> 14:27.238
This is your yearbook! I still read things
people wrote in my high school yearbook.

14:27.322 --> 14:31.159
"People say we won't stay
friends later in life.

14:31.242 --> 14:33.578
In this case, it's true...

14:36.164 --> 14:37.165
See ya never."

14:37.248 --> 14:40.002
Who wouldn't want to save that?

14:41.377 --> 14:42.838
[Robert laughs]

14:44.380 --> 14:48.510
What do I do with this
stack of birthday cards?

14:48.593 --> 14:50.804
They're from your parents.
You'd want to save these.

14:50.887 --> 14:52.555
They're from you when
you were a little girl.

14:52.639 --> 14:54.975
- Toss 'em.
- Bye-bye!

14:55.058 --> 14:56.977
So long, poignant memories.

15:05.276 --> 15:08.237
[Brianna] Zephyrentamental's bed!

15:14.536 --> 15:16.663
- What are you looking for?
- It's nothing.

15:20.333 --> 15:23.586
Sol, could you get me, like,
a sandwich or something?

15:23.670 --> 15:28.216
Sweetheart, there's no amount of sandwiches

15:28.299 --> 15:31.219
that can fill the void you
must be feeling right now.

15:31.302 --> 15:34.806
Of course, I could whip
you up a nice panini...

15:34.890 --> 15:36.683
Great! Yes! Panini! Go!

15:36.766 --> 15:38.518
Thank you!

15:39.978 --> 15:43.147
- I scare him, don't I?
- He's terrified of you.

15:43.231 --> 15:45.608
That makes me so happy.

15:45.692 --> 15:48.319
So were you open with him?
Did you tell him what you like?

15:48.403 --> 15:51.489
- What do you like in bed?
- Privacy.

15:51.573 --> 15:54.826
Come on. You've got to speak up
or it'll never get any better.

15:54.910 --> 15:56.703
You know what I like in bed?

15:56.786 --> 15:59.748
I like for the man next
to me to be the right man.

15:59.831 --> 16:03.543
Guy is tall, he's full of life, not gay...

16:03.626 --> 16:07.714
Did you remind him that direct clitoral
stimulation is essential before,

16:07.797 --> 16:11.300
- during, and often after penetration?
- Yes, I used those exact words.

16:11.384 --> 16:14.637
No! I'm 70 years old.

16:16.056 --> 16:18.934
Actually, I have never once
talked about my c-l-i-t-o...

16:19.017 --> 16:21.436
Who's the child? It's
anatomical. Say the word.

16:21.519 --> 16:23.646
- No.
- How about if I show you mine?

16:23.730 --> 16:25.189
Clitoris!

16:25.273 --> 16:27.692
Clitoris! Clitoris!

16:27.776 --> 16:29.527
[laughs]

16:29.611 --> 16:31.529
- Why?
- Why what?

16:31.613 --> 16:34.741
Why now? I mean, you're
barely a year sober.

16:34.824 --> 16:37.285
I mean, are you just looking
for some other kind of charge?

16:37.368 --> 16:40.830
Fuck you! No! I want to find my mother.

16:40.914 --> 16:42.457
Your biological mother. Okay.

16:42.540 --> 16:44.375
Because our actual mother,
the woman who raised us

16:44.459 --> 16:47.170
since we were babies is going
through a pretty hard time right now.

16:47.253 --> 16:49.839
So if she finds out about this,
it could push her over the edge.

16:49.923 --> 16:52.508
My God, would you stop it
with the guilt trip? Please?

16:54.385 --> 16:57.180
Look, I just want to
know where I come from.

16:57.263 --> 16:59.015
San Diego. The Bergsteins.

16:59.099 --> 17:01.684
I want to sit across the table
from someone who looks like me.

17:01.768 --> 17:03.186
Can't you understand that?

17:03.269 --> 17:05.814
No, what would an adopted,
black, Ashkenazi Jew

17:05.896 --> 17:07.690
living in San Diego understand about that?

17:07.773 --> 17:11.111
- Exactly. And you're not curious?
- Not enough.

17:11.194 --> 17:16.157
I mean, what if she's some sort
of hooker, or a crack whore?

17:16.240 --> 17:19.367
Or just... someone who didn't want me.

17:19.452 --> 17:23.205
The good news is I'm more likely to
have a crack whore for a parent than you.

17:23.289 --> 17:25.750
- Then why do it?
- I don't know.

17:27.460 --> 17:29.838
Look...

17:29.921 --> 17:33.675
now that I'm-I'm waking up to my life,

17:33.758 --> 17:38.972
okay, I can feel this pull. I
can feel it from my stomach, Bud.

17:39.055 --> 17:41.307
And I don't think that it's going away.

17:43.226 --> 17:47.856
Look, you don't have to do anything.
Okay? This is not your responsibility.

17:49.565 --> 17:51.734
I wasn't even going to tell you.

17:53.111 --> 17:54.278
I'm glad that I did.

17:54.362 --> 17:56.322
I don't understand why you have to do this,

17:56.405 --> 17:59.242
but I do understand
that you have to do this.

17:59.325 --> 18:00.326
Do you understand?

18:01.870 --> 18:03.872
Well...

18:03.955 --> 18:08.543
my mom's pretty stupid.
So... I'm stupid, too.

18:08.626 --> 18:13.131
You make fun... but that
could actually be your mother.

18:15.675 --> 18:18.887
Well, Bud gardens like
one hell of a lawyer.

18:18.970 --> 18:21.681
Well, it's good of you to take a look.

18:21.764 --> 18:23.183
How bad is it?

18:23.266 --> 18:25.685
You might just wait for the next
storm and let the sea take it.

18:25.768 --> 18:28.021
[laughs]

18:32.901 --> 18:34.903
You got a great laugh.

18:34.986 --> 18:36.988
I, um...

18:38.447 --> 18:40.366
Are-are-are
you thirsty?

18:40.449 --> 18:44.620
You want drink? A drink? In a cup?

18:44.704 --> 18:46.330
Let's see, I have mate...

18:47.540 --> 18:49.584
I'd love some mate.

18:51.044 --> 18:54.047
Um... I have goat milk...

18:54.130 --> 18:56.299
- Mate's fine.
- Yeah...

18:56.382 --> 18:58.551
I'll just go in and get it,

18:58.634 --> 19:03.139
- Jack-ub. Jacob. Jacobin.
[laughs] - [chuckles]

19:03.223 --> 19:05.308
Um...

19:05.391 --> 19:08.144
Fuck, shit.

19:08.228 --> 19:12.356
Yes, it was nice. Tonight sounds wonderful.

19:12.440 --> 19:13.900
Okay.

19:16.402 --> 19:22.117
Frankie, Guy and I just made plans
for him to have another orgasm tonight.

19:22.200 --> 19:23.868
Frankie?

19:23.952 --> 19:28.456
You are right. He is flirting!

19:28.539 --> 19:32.501
Frankie, that man is out there
literally sowing his oats in your garden.

19:32.585 --> 19:33.711
What am I going to do?

19:33.795 --> 19:37.673
I haven't been in this
situation with a man in 40 years.

19:37.757 --> 19:40.885
According to you, just tell him
about your clitoris and it'll be fine.

19:40.969 --> 19:43.429
Oh, why am I asking you for advice?

19:43.512 --> 19:45.765
Well, at least I've had
mediocre sex recently.

19:45.848 --> 19:48.977
Look, just flirt back a little,
you know, see how you feel.

19:49.060 --> 19:53.231
Oh, last time I flirted was
1968 and it was basically,

19:53.315 --> 19:55.317
"Do you want to do it?" "Sure."

19:55.399 --> 19:59.070
Flirting outside of hippie sex
pile is a little more nuanced.

19:59.154 --> 20:03.158
Display, display open body language.

20:03.241 --> 20:04.700
Ask a lot of questions.

20:04.784 --> 20:06.661
You both love dirt, ask him about that.

20:06.744 --> 20:09.497
- Okay. I can do that.
- Yeah.

20:09.580 --> 20:12.625
And men love it when women
mimic their body language.

20:13.668 --> 20:16.212
You know, and laugh, laugh at what he says.

20:16.296 --> 20:19.174
[mocks laughter]

20:19.257 --> 20:20.300
Give me some paper.

20:20.383 --> 20:24.304
Oh, and tilt your head
slightly to the side.

20:24.387 --> 20:26.681
- Why?
- It shows deep concern

20:26.764 --> 20:30.226
- about what he's saying.
- You mean like my retriever used to do?

20:30.310 --> 20:33.688
- Exactly. Like Mahatma used to do.
- Oh, God.

20:38.151 --> 20:41.279
- Is this what you're looking for?
- [gasps]

20:41.363 --> 20:44.573
Zephyrentamental. Where did you find him?

20:44.657 --> 20:47.118
I... I had him.

20:47.202 --> 20:50.663
You know, when you went
away to college, I just...

20:50.746 --> 20:52.915
I just kept him.

20:54.792 --> 20:58.129
- You kept him for me?
- For me, too.

21:01.216 --> 21:04.635
- And you didn't wash him.
- He never liked baths.

21:04.719 --> 21:06.762
You remember when you did
that operation on this eye?

21:06.846 --> 21:10.516
- We almost lost him.
- You had a steady hand.

21:11.684 --> 21:13.853
You don't get this with boys.

21:15.897 --> 21:17.523
Sol!

21:17.606 --> 21:19.984
- Oh, God...
- [Robert chuckles]

21:22.070 --> 21:24.447
But then the water can't get in there,

21:24.530 --> 21:27.575
that's why you've got to aerate the soil.

21:28.743 --> 21:31.620
That is so fascinating.

21:31.704 --> 21:33.789
[chuckles]

21:42.631 --> 21:44.967
- Ah!
- Ah.

21:45.051 --> 21:47.929
- Mmm. Hmm.
- Mmm.

21:52.016 --> 21:53.851
[chuckles]

21:53.935 --> 21:57.146
- So, where did you go to school?
- Humboldt State University.

21:57.230 --> 21:58.564
Oh!

21:59.607 --> 22:04.362
Cornhuskers. [laughs awkwardly]

22:04.446 --> 22:05.529
Lumberjacks.

22:06.530 --> 22:11.119
Oh! [exaggerated laughter]

22:15.457 --> 22:17.792
What... what the fuck am I doing?

22:17.875 --> 22:19.252
Are you all right?

22:19.335 --> 22:23.089
No, no. Grace had this stupid idea
that you were flirting with me,

22:23.172 --> 22:26.259
so I tried to flirt
back. You couldn't tell.

22:26.342 --> 22:29.095
- I thought you were having a stroke.
- [chuckles]

22:29.178 --> 22:31.013
I'm terrible at this.

22:33.933 --> 22:35.477
I've got an idea.

22:41.149 --> 22:42.817
Damn. That's some good cheeba.

22:42.900 --> 22:47.989
I cross-pollinated a super-strain
of White Widow and some Hindu Kush.

22:48.072 --> 22:49.573
I call it...

22:53.077 --> 22:57.457
- God damn, I'm totally blanking.
- [chuckles]

22:59.292 --> 23:01.210
Can't remember what I call it.

23:02.420 --> 23:05.256
- So how's that car running?
- The what?

23:05.340 --> 23:09.469
You know. You were making
a lubricant for Grace's car.

23:09.552 --> 23:12.472
Oh, right! That was a lie.

23:12.555 --> 23:15.308
That was personal lube.

23:15.391 --> 23:17.768
For Grace's person.

23:18.853 --> 23:20.938
Is it any good?

23:22.482 --> 23:26.068
- Best damn yams, best damn lube.
- [chuckles]

23:28.612 --> 23:32.534
Oh, I gotta go. That's for you.

23:32.616 --> 23:34.536
Wow, nice.

23:35.953 --> 23:40.875
For the record, Grace
was right. I was flirting.

23:40.958 --> 23:42.377
[coughing]

23:50.968 --> 23:55.723
Is it okay that I'm using your
copy of Toxic People as a coaster?

23:55.806 --> 23:57.933
Well, it's actually Frankie's,

23:58.017 --> 24:01.729
but she keeps leaving it
out for me, so have at it.

24:10.654 --> 24:13.282
This is all I've been able to think about.

24:13.366 --> 24:15.326
Me, too.

24:19.955 --> 24:22.917
Oh, hey, I brought a flashlight.

24:24.627 --> 24:26.462
Good planning.

24:35.012 --> 24:36.180
Um...

24:36.264 --> 24:41.310
Uh, hmm. I'm sorry. Is
this not what you want?

24:41.394 --> 24:43.104
Yeah, no, I...

24:43.187 --> 24:47.483
- Remember these? Do you remember?
- Of course I do.

24:47.567 --> 24:52.029
- I didn't realize you were a vinyl lover.
- Well, they're Frankie's.

24:52.113 --> 24:55.617
She's not so much a lover of vinyl but...

24:55.699 --> 24:58.160
she just can't open CDs.

24:58.244 --> 24:59.662
[laughs]

24:59.745 --> 25:02.415
Um...

25:02.498 --> 25:05.834
[Latin music plays]

25:05.918 --> 25:07.211
Would you dance with me?

25:09.672 --> 25:12.300
Grace, I've got two left feet...

25:13.468 --> 25:15.428
That's okay, I'll lead.

25:19.390 --> 25:22.017
Wow, that's nice. Isn't it?

25:25.980 --> 25:27.982
Isn't this beautiful?

25:33.862 --> 25:35.864
Oh, boy.

25:41.663 --> 25:43.080
Put your hand here.

25:44.248 --> 25:46.584
- Right here?
- A little lower.

25:47.918 --> 25:51.297
- Like that?
- Perfect.

25:54.216 --> 25:56.927
Can you come a little closer?

26:01.307 --> 26:03.142
Oh!

26:04.852 --> 26:06.061
Take your time.

26:07.104 --> 26:08.105
Okay.

26:13.528 --> 26:16.280
You're doing great.

26:16.364 --> 26:18.741
You make it easy.

26:27.208 --> 26:28.668
What else?

26:30.378 --> 26:32.421
Look in my eyes.
