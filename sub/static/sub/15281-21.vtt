01:15.700 --> 01:18.100
- Hey, Paul, you hear that?
- Yeah.

01:19.000 --> 01:21.965
Hey, you gotta challenge
yourself, Johnny.

01:22.000 --> 01:24.200
That's the only way you're
ever going to get better.

01:24.700 --> 01:26.900
Ok, so, you aim straight for the heart

01:26.935 --> 01:29.267
Try to avoid the shoulder blades, and

01:29.302 --> 01:31.600
Uh, should be a quick, clean kill.

01:33.700 --> 01:35.300
Ok, so, don't over think it.

01:35.700 --> 01:38.600
You know what to do,
just- just aim and shoot.

01:54.300 --> 01:55.800
Well, don't worry.

01:56.700 --> 01:59.100
Took me a long time to
get my first big one.

02:00.900 --> 02:03.100
You just need more practice.

02:15.600 --> 02:17.100
Hey, hey, easy.

02:22.600 --> 02:24.700
I think we've been here 5 minutes.

02:25.200 --> 02:27.465
Yeah, but look at her,
broke away from the group

02:27.500 --> 02:30.300
Guy saw her alone, felt
confident, and made his move.

02:30.335 --> 02:31.900
It must be serious.

02:33.000 --> 02:37.600
Ladies, this is Brad,
a real F.B.I. agent.

02:38.100 --> 02:39.600
- Really?
- Really.

02:39.635 --> 02:40.865
No way.

02:40.900 --> 02:43.400
That's exciting. What's
it like at Quantico?

02:43.700 --> 02:45.400
It's, uh, quite impressive.

02:45.700 --> 02:48.100
- What department are you in?
- That's classified.

02:48.800 --> 02:52.400
Ooh, must be really tough
keeping all those secrets.

02:52.435 --> 02:54.365
You know, it's a skill
like anything else.

02:54.400 --> 02:57.465
Carpenters are good at
building stuff, measuring.

02:57.500 --> 03:01.400
F.B.I. is good at keeping
secrets and kicking criminal ass.

03:02.900 --> 03:04.565
Well, somebody has got to do it.

03:04.600 --> 03:07.800
Oh, do you have to carry your gun
and badge with you everywhere you go?

03:07.835 --> 03:09.417
Affirmative.

03:09.452 --> 03:10.965
Can we see it?

03:11.000 --> 03:13.900
- See what?
- Your badge.

03:15.200 --> 03:17.800
- Please.
- I'm sorry, that's...

03:18.500 --> 03:20.665
Classified.

03:20.700 --> 03:21.765
Figures. Of course.

03:21.800 --> 03:24.300
Tell me, Brad, does it
look anything like this?

03:24.900 --> 03:27.200
Or, uh, this?

03:27.400 --> 03:29.400
Or maybe this?

03:35.700 --> 03:38.200
Poor lass, it's a tough job.

03:39.600 --> 03:40.300
Agent Jareau.

03:40.400 --> 03:44.500
Lady, you are officially in my top 8,
and I am so blogging about this later.

03:44.600 --> 03:46.600
Clink me.

03:49.700 --> 03:51.600
Sorry, ladies.

03:56.200 --> 03:59.700
A year ago victims and their vehicles
disappeared from Washington state.

03:59.735 --> 04:03.500
They were found over 200 miles
away in the remote woods of Idaho.

04:03.535 --> 04:07.765
Courtney Jacobs, 24,
and Shane Everett, 25.

04:07.800 --> 04:11.600
Autopsy revealed similar entry
and exit wounds through the chest.

04:11.635 --> 04:12.765
Ballistics?

04:12.800 --> 04:14.265
No bullets were found.

04:14.300 --> 04:17.700
Looks like they were out there for
a long time before they were killed.

04:17.800 --> 04:20.399
- At least 6 or 7 days.
- Then, what happened in that week?

04:20.435 --> 04:21.464
I don't want to know.

04:21.500 --> 04:24.800
Look at the way they're dressed, they didn't
voluntarily go into the woods like that.

04:25.100 --> 04:27.065
Yeah, neither did this man.

04:27.100 --> 04:30.200
Found yesterday with similar
wounds, there's still no I.D.

04:30.235 --> 04:32.867
Ok, so, I'm gonna look for
missing persons in Washington.

04:32.902 --> 04:35.500
Look everywhere, we don't know
where this victim came from

04:35.535 --> 04:36.800
We only know where he ended up.

04:36.900 --> 04:39.365
Kills both males and females.

04:39.400 --> 04:42.265
Victims were found with their
clothes on, no degradation

04:42.300 --> 04:45.100
No experimentation, doesn't look
like he's interested in either.

04:45.135 --> 04:47.500
A serial killer with
no sexual preference?

04:47.535 --> 04:48.765
That'd be a first.

04:48.800 --> 04:52.800
Broken nose and bark is embedded in
his face, looks like he ran into a tree.

04:52.835 --> 04:54.800
Now, how do you miss a huge tree?

04:55.200 --> 04:56.665
Too busy looking behind you.

04:56.700 --> 04:58.600
None of these are defensive wounds.

04:58.635 --> 05:00.465
Courtney Jacobs' hands are torn up.

05:00.500 --> 05:03.500
Shane Everett has only got one shoe on,
it's like he ran out of the other one.

05:03.535 --> 05:06.617
He sustained numerous
injuries and just kept going.

05:06.652 --> 05:09.700
Only one thing you run
that hard for- your life.

05:51.702 --> 05:55.502
One man's wilderness is
another man's theme park.

05:56.002 --> 05:57.802
Author unknown.

05:58.302 --> 06:02.567
Transporting young, fit victims from
Washington to Idaho poses huge risks.

06:02.602 --> 06:06.202
Must have a good reason to chance getting
pulled over, or have the victims escape.

06:06.402 --> 06:10.102
It says here that every year 100 or so
people go missing in Idaho's wilderness.

06:10.137 --> 06:13.802
With millions of acres to cover,
1/3 of them are never found.

06:13.837 --> 06:15.902
Sounds like the reason
as to why this place.

06:16.002 --> 06:19.967
Well, it offers privacy and the possibility
the body will never be recovered.

06:20.002 --> 06:23.702
An area this remote and rugged suggests that
the offender is more comfortable in the woods.

06:24.202 --> 06:25.567
Something like a second home.

06:25.602 --> 06:27.902
My grandfather retired
to the french alps.

06:27.937 --> 06:29.667
He lived there until he died.

06:29.702 --> 06:33.002
There was a good 10-year stretch where
he didn't come down off the mountain.

06:33.037 --> 06:36.167
He had no running water, no electricity

06:36.202 --> 06:39.002
And his food supplies, everything,
all of it came from the land.

06:39.037 --> 06:40.667
You spent a lot of time up there?

06:40.702 --> 06:43.802
Yeah, whenever we were in
France, which was a lot.

06:45.402 --> 06:46.567
Guess who's getting a gold star?

06:46.602 --> 06:49.402
Oh, that'd be you, baby girl,
if you got some good news for us.

06:49.437 --> 06:52.167
Well, I started my missing
persons search in Spokane county

06:52.202 --> 06:56.002
And wouldn't you know, there's been 10 in
the last 5 years, all in their early twenties.

06:56.037 --> 06:56.867
And isn't this interesting?

06:56.902 --> 06:58.902
It's always in the spring and
their cars are never recovered.

06:58.937 --> 07:00.902
And fret not, I'm
looking for the cars, too.

07:00.937 --> 07:02.367
- Anything else?
- Mmm, oh, local P. D.

07:02.402 --> 07:05.202
I dentified the latest
victim through dental records.

07:05.237 --> 07:07.202
His name's Alex Harrison,
he's from Washington.

07:07.237 --> 07:08.667
Where was he last seen?

07:08.702 --> 07:11.767
Family statements say he was
traveling to work in Spokane

07:11.802 --> 07:14.502
And both victims last year were
traveling outside of Spokane, too.

07:14.537 --> 07:15.967
All victims headed to the city.

07:16.002 --> 07:18.402
And none of them reached
their destination.

07:18.437 --> 07:19.867
- Garcia?
- Already on it.

07:19.902 --> 07:25.502
There are 4 major roadways into Spokane,
highways 395, 195, and highway 2.

07:25.902 --> 07:27.767
There's also interstate 90.

07:27.802 --> 07:31.102
Were there any police reports or roadside
assistance calls from those highways?

07:31.137 --> 07:33.702
You're going to know
that as soon as I do.

07:33.737 --> 07:35.502
Ok, we've got 2 locations.

07:35.602 --> 07:37.267
I'm happy to go to Idaho.

07:37.302 --> 07:39.302
Woods is like your second
home, right, Prentiss?

07:39.337 --> 07:40.367
Yes, sir.

07:40.402 --> 07:42.302
Hey, Reid, why don't you go to Spokane?

07:42.402 --> 07:43.967
I could use the fresh air.

07:44.002 --> 07:46.052
We'll touch base every couple of hours.

07:46.087 --> 07:48.102
I'll call you when we
get on the mountain.

07:49.202 --> 07:52.802
We've got 2 male and 1 female
victim, all about the same age,

07:52.837 --> 07:55.202
But from different
socio-economic backgrounds.

07:55.502 --> 07:58.302
The only thing they seem to have in common
is they were traveling to the same city.

07:58.337 --> 07:59.802
And broken bones.

07:59.902 --> 08:04.202
There's a hairline fracture in the wrist,
a sprained ankle, and a broken nose.

08:04.402 --> 08:07.502
Also, early autopsy reports
show soft, clean tissue damage

08:07.537 --> 08:10.202
And deep puncture wounds
through the major organs.

08:10.602 --> 08:13.352
Bullets flare out when they hit the
body, it's gotta be something else.

08:13.387 --> 08:16.102
Whatever weapon was used cut completely
through the front of the chest

08:16.137 --> 08:17.767
And went right out of the back.

08:17.802 --> 08:21.702
It's interesting, given the point of
entry, that each victim has 2 wounds.

08:21.737 --> 08:23.302
And it's always 2.

08:23.602 --> 08:25.302
Uh, Raymond Schaeffer.

08:26.202 --> 08:28.067
- You must be agent Jareau.
- Nice to meet you.

08:28.102 --> 08:30.602
This is special agent aaron
Hotchner. Dr. Spencer Reid.

08:30.637 --> 08:32.818
This is sheriff Raymond Schaeffer.

08:32.854 --> 08:34.967
Well, I see you're getting settled.

08:35.001 --> 08:37.402
- Thank you for the space.
- Well, thank you for flying out.

08:37.437 --> 08:40.102
Um, has Alex Harrison's
family been notified yet?

08:40.302 --> 08:41.467
Not yet.

08:41.501 --> 08:43.202
Uh, parents were divorced,
he lived with his father.

08:43.302 --> 08:45.502
I was waiting for your unit to arrive.

08:47.602 --> 08:50.002
- I could use the company.
- I'm happy to come along.

08:50.037 --> 08:52.402
- Hotch, I'll let you know what I find.
- Thanks.

08:54.002 --> 08:55.702
Is this your first
notification, sheriff?

08:55.737 --> 08:57.167
Uh, is it that obvious?

08:57.202 --> 08:59.302
Uh, I can give you a few tips.

08:59.337 --> 09:01.767
I just got this promotion

09:01.802 --> 09:05.602
And the sheriff I replaced
retired after 30 years.

09:05.702 --> 09:08.702
So, I got big shoes to fill.

09:10.102 --> 09:12.302
I'm just happy deaths
in our county are down.

09:12.902 --> 09:15.402
Well, believe me, it never gets easy.

09:16.702 --> 09:19.802
This father's worst nightmare
is about to come true.

09:22.202 --> 09:24.102
Boise National Forest BOISE, IDAHO

09:27.802 --> 09:29.502
How was the drive up the mountain?

09:29.537 --> 09:31.202
Well, before or after the flat tire?

09:31.237 --> 09:32.567
That good, huh?

09:32.602 --> 09:33.967
I'm the head ranger, Lizzie Evans.

09:34.002 --> 09:36.002
Hi, agent Prentiss,
this is agent Morgan.

09:36.037 --> 09:37.467
Agent Gideon's still in town.

09:37.502 --> 09:40.002
You must be exhausted from the
trip, but we need to keep moving.

09:40.037 --> 09:42.002
We want to be out of here by nightfall.

09:42.037 --> 09:44.102
Then, by all means, after you.

09:53.302 --> 09:56.102
- Yes?
- Sir, are you Timothy Harrison?

09:58.302 --> 10:00.102
Is this about Alex?

10:02.302 --> 10:06.702
Politely ask them to sit, and, uh,
be prepared for a physical reaction.

10:06.737 --> 10:08.367
I once had a woman
faint and hit her head

10:08.402 --> 10:11.002
And I had to give her the news
a second time at the hospital.

10:11.502 --> 10:13.302
That wasn't fun.

10:16.302 --> 10:19.367
Mr. Harrison, can we sit down?

10:19.402 --> 10:21.302
If you don't mind, I'd like to stand.

10:22.002 --> 10:24.367
Sir, I wish I didn't
have to tell you this

10:24.402 --> 10:29.202
But we've found your son Alex
in the boise national forest.

10:29.237 --> 10:31.302
So, he's ok?

10:33.202 --> 10:38.702
I'm so sorry, Mr. Harrison, but
Alex wasn't alive when we found him.

10:39.702 --> 10:41.967
Denial is the first emotion

10:42.002 --> 10:45.302
so be prepared to explain to them
how you know that this is their child.

10:47.402 --> 10:49.267
This is a mistake.

10:49.302 --> 10:51.352
Alex doesn't know anyone in Idaho.

10:51.387 --> 10:53.367
How do you even know it's him?

10:53.402 --> 10:55.402
Well, sir, when you file
a missing persons report

10:55.437 --> 10:57.702
You gave us access
to his dental records.

10:57.737 --> 10:59.567
You're lying.

10:59.602 --> 11:02.602
Be gentle, allow
yourself to show emotion.

11:02.637 --> 11:05.567
It'll validate what
the family is feeling.

11:05.602 --> 11:08.802
First rule on the police
force, agent Jareau, no crying.

11:12.302 --> 11:14.602
God, tell me this isn't true.

11:14.702 --> 11:18.302
I'll do anything, please help me.

11:18.702 --> 11:22.402
We can't imagine what you're
going through, Mr. Harrison.

11:22.437 --> 11:25.002
He's all I've got, my boy.

11:25.102 --> 11:27.502
Don't you understand?

11:28.002 --> 11:29.702
I do.

11:30.802 --> 11:34.702
Sir, we're investigating Alex's
death as a possible homicide.

11:36.602 --> 11:37.667
Murder?

11:37.702 --> 11:41.002
We were hoping that maybe you
could answer some questions.

11:44.202 --> 11:47.602
Alex was the best wide out
the huskies had seen in years.

11:49.602 --> 11:53.202
He was physical, strong.

11:53.602 --> 11:55.502
He had great instincts.

11:55.902 --> 11:58.502
After graduation he wanted a career.

11:59.002 --> 12:02.502
Didn't want to be known as a
jock. This can't be happening.

12:08.802 --> 12:11.702
- I need to call Alex's mother.
- Of course.

12:12.702 --> 12:15.202
We'll stay here until
your family arrives.

12:21.502 --> 12:22.802
How long have you been a ranger?

12:23.102 --> 12:26.302
5 years now, but I've lived
in these woods my whole life.

12:26.337 --> 12:28.302
Growing up out here
help you do your job?

12:29.702 --> 12:32.702
Look around. Do you see
or hear anything right now?

12:33.502 --> 12:34.767
- No.
- No.

12:34.802 --> 12:37.402
There's a black bear about
25 yards to your right.

12:41.602 --> 12:44.067
How long before we're able to do that?

12:44.102 --> 12:46.302
Depends on how well
you use your instincts.

12:48.302 --> 12:50.467
Well, this gives new
meaning to the word remote.

12:50.502 --> 12:54.102
Yeah, it'd be awfully hard to find this
location if you weren't familiar with the area.

12:54.702 --> 12:58.702
There must only be a handful of people who
know the terrain well enough to survive.

12:59.802 --> 13:01.467
Boot tracks.

13:01.502 --> 13:04.002
They're the same tread,
but they're different sizes.

13:04.037 --> 13:07.069
Well, there's at least 2
people who know this terrain.

13:07.104 --> 13:10.102
Ok, so, this is where Alex
Harrison's body was found.

13:10.137 --> 13:12.167
Morgan, from this particular spot

13:12.202 --> 13:15.702
There are areas of higher ground that
look down to where the victim died.

13:17.002 --> 13:19.502
Yeah, I got a perfect view of
you through the trees right here.

13:19.537 --> 13:21.869
Those are basic tactics
that hunters use.

13:21.904 --> 13:24.202
They use vantage points
to watch their prey.

13:24.602 --> 13:26.567
If these are tactics
that hunters use...

13:26.602 --> 13:29.702
They were precise enough to cover each other
and take out their prey at the same time.

13:31.102 --> 13:35.102
If both victims have 2 wounds,
could be one for each offender.

13:37.902 --> 13:40.802
I think we know how Alex Harrison died.

13:56.802 --> 13:59.102
You think this guy looks bad,
you should see the driver.

13:59.137 --> 14:01.002
He needed 10 stitches.

14:02.302 --> 14:04.602
You better hurry, all
the groups are filling up.

14:05.102 --> 14:07.802
You like the challenge
of a bear, don't you?

14:08.702 --> 14:11.602
Actually, I prefer picking
up my meat at a grocery store.

14:11.902 --> 14:13.702
Oh, you're one of those, huh?

14:14.202 --> 14:15.267
Better be careful out there

14:15.302 --> 14:18.102
Because in 3 days it's going to
get busy as hell up on our mountain.

14:18.137 --> 14:18.967
Hunting season?

14:19.002 --> 14:22.502
Yeah, ever since somebody wrote
about us in some fancy travel magazine

14:22.537 --> 14:24.867
We've got loads of
tourists migrating up here.

14:24.902 --> 14:28.202
If I was going to take out an animal
anywhere from 100 to 200 pounds

14:28.237 --> 14:29.767
what type of weapon would I use?

14:29.802 --> 14:32.302
A shotgun and compound bow are the tops

14:32.337 --> 14:34.402
but buckshot can be a bit messy.

14:35.102 --> 14:36.667
I love arrows.

14:36.702 --> 14:39.402
It can completely penetrate
the body of a small animal.

14:39.437 --> 14:41.502
It's the most effective kill.

14:42.602 --> 14:44.302
Arrows.

14:53.702 --> 14:55.067
Hotchner.

14:55.102 --> 14:57.002
Hold on a minute, I'll
put you on speaker.

14:58.202 --> 15:00.467
Hunting season officially
opens in 3 days.

15:00.502 --> 15:02.867
Does it look like the victim's
wounds could be from an arrow?

15:02.902 --> 15:06.102
Whatever punctured the organs had to
be long enough to penetrate the chest

15:06.137 --> 15:10.502
and mimic a 22 caliber bullet,
so, yeah, it's possible.

15:10.902 --> 15:13.802
I think these victims are
being caught, taken to the woods

15:13.837 --> 15:17.202
and hunted like wild animals.

15:31.502 --> 15:33.902
Oh, not again. Come on, Ruby.

15:34.802 --> 15:36.702
Come on, baby, a few more miles.

15:38.702 --> 15:40.502
Damn it.

15:45.802 --> 15:47.702
Hi, hello?

15:47.802 --> 15:51.002
Hi, I called before, my
car's broken down for good.

15:51.102 --> 15:52.902
Highway 2.

15:55.002 --> 15:57.802
Can you hear me? Never mind.

16:18.502 --> 16:20.202
You need some help, miss?

16:37.726 --> 16:39.726
So, I started pulling hunting licenses.

16:40.026 --> 16:42.926
You should narrow down the
suspect list before you dive in.

16:42.961 --> 16:44.626
Well, what else are we looking for?

16:44.926 --> 16:45.791
You're about to find out.

16:45.826 --> 16:48.826
We're looking for at least 2
offenders in good physical condition.

16:49.126 --> 16:51.226
You'd have to be fit to
make it through this terrain.

16:51.526 --> 16:53.726
And nobody would go that deep
into the woods without backup.

16:54.026 --> 16:56.826
Killing teams are like most
partnerships, one weak, the other strong.

16:57.426 --> 17:00.126
These men haven't exhibited any
sexual interest in their victims

17:00.226 --> 17:03.726
So they're either developmentally
prepubescent- - Or they could be related.

17:04.226 --> 17:06.726
Immediate relatives wouldn't
discuss sexual encounters

17:06.761 --> 17:08.925
Let alone perform them
in front of each other.

17:09.026 --> 17:12.726
If they are related, they could
have an us-versus-them mentality.

17:13.026 --> 17:15.526
Their bond will be unbreakable
because it's all they know.

17:15.560 --> 17:17.790
Most hunters put animals
out of their misery.

17:17.826 --> 17:20.691
The men we're looking for,
they don't show any mercy.

17:20.726 --> 17:23.626
These guys take pleasure in watching
their casualties die a slow death.

17:24.126 --> 17:27.290
Every spring for the past 5
years, people have gone missing.

17:27.326 --> 17:30.626
We think the killers wait for their
prey to migrate through these woods.

17:30.926 --> 17:33.926
Courtney Jacobs, Shane Everett,
and Alex Harrison were all healthy

17:33.961 --> 17:36.926
Smart adults who survived for
days by following their instincts.

17:36.961 --> 17:39.091
They found themselves
in the middle of nowhere.

17:39.126 --> 17:41.626
They were either approached in a
way that wasn't threatening...

17:41.661 --> 17:44.026
Or the offenders waited
for a moment of weakness.

17:44.926 --> 17:46.291
The perfect time to attack.

17:46.326 --> 17:49.526
These particular hunters are very
seasoned, they're very efficient.

17:49.561 --> 17:52.726
It's no surprise that they've
chosen a weapon to be a compound bow.

17:53.126 --> 17:55.591
It requires the utmost precision

17:55.626 --> 17:59.026
And it provides them with
a challenge every time.

17:59.126 --> 18:03.226
Like the trophy hunter, these men,
they plan their killings with care.

18:03.261 --> 18:05.091
They decide the type
of victims they want,

18:05.126 --> 18:07.626
How and where they want to
kill them, and with what weapon.

18:07.661 --> 18:09.826
Hunting is their sport.

18:09.926 --> 18:11.926
Humans are their targets.

18:12.526 --> 18:15.426
Use every hunter's
instinct in your bodies.

18:17.026 --> 18:18.526
Good luck.

18:20.926 --> 18:22.226
Yeah, Garcia?

18:22.926 --> 18:24.926
If they were buying their
weapons close to home

18:24.961 --> 18:26.926
We need a list of hunting
stores in Spokane county.

18:28.326 --> 18:29.776
Let me call you back.

18:29.811 --> 18:31.226
You should hear this.

18:33.826 --> 18:37.226
The newspaper said the F.B.I. was
here investigating those homicides.

18:37.526 --> 18:39.076
I didn't know where else to go.

18:39.111 --> 18:40.626
When Bobbi didn't show up or call

18:41.026 --> 18:43.326
- When was the last time you talked to her?
- Yesterday.

18:43.926 --> 18:47.326
She was going to stay with me before
this big job interview in Spokane.

18:47.826 --> 18:49.591
She was really excited about it.

18:49.626 --> 18:52.626
So, when she didn't show up, I knew
in my gut that something was wrong.

18:53.226 --> 18:56.026
I was the one that convinced her
to stay with me, and, now...

18:57.526 --> 18:59.526
This isn't your fault.

19:00.226 --> 19:01.626
Ok.

19:04.626 --> 19:06.526
Should we get some fresh air?

19:12.926 --> 19:14.926
She's only been missing
since last night.

19:14.961 --> 19:16.191
You sure it's related?

19:16.226 --> 19:18.726
I'm not going to wait to find out,
I'm going to fax this to Gideon.

19:21.126 --> 19:24.226
It's been 3 days since
they killed Alex Harrison.

19:24.626 --> 19:26.926
Why'd they take another victim so soon?

19:26.961 --> 19:28.493
This is their hunting season.

19:28.528 --> 19:29.991
Then they can't waste any time.

19:30.026 --> 19:31.926
Only 2 days before it
gets crowded around here.

19:31.961 --> 19:33.291
They won't have any more privacy.

19:33.326 --> 19:36.026
If Bobbi Baird is their next
victim, she could be on her way.

19:38.626 --> 19:40.426
This is Evans, I need road blocks now.

19:52.026 --> 19:54.126
<i>It's more than a feeling
more than a feeling</i>

19:56.326 --> 19:58.726
<i>When I hear that old
song they used to...</i>

19:58.761 --> 20:00.926
<i>More than a feeling</i>

20:30.426 --> 20:33.126
You got that down good. Man,
it reminds me of uncle Joe.

20:34.726 --> 20:36.726
Whoa, we got a live one.

20:38.426 --> 20:40.026
Get away from me!

20:43.126 --> 20:44.826
Get it out!

20:49.226 --> 20:51.326
- There you go. -
Are-are you done?

20:51.726 --> 20:54.126
- What are you doing?
- Nobody can hear you.

20:55.726 --> 20:57.476
Yeah, you gotta save your strength.

20:57.511 --> 20:59.226
What the hell do you want from me?

20:59.261 --> 21:01.026
You want to have some fun?

21:01.726 --> 21:03.526
Go ahead, you- you
want to tell her?

21:07.626 --> 21:08.726
Run.

21:24.926 --> 21:26.726
Go!

21:28.126 --> 21:31.591
Bobby Baird's last 2 cell phone
connections were both to 911.

21:31.626 --> 21:35.426
Looks like each call only lasted a
couple of seconds before they dropped out.

21:35.926 --> 21:37.926
She was on highway 2.

21:38.526 --> 21:40.026
It's a dead zone for cell phones.

21:40.061 --> 21:41.491
Any idea what the trouble was?

21:41.526 --> 21:43.491
None, cruiser was
dispatched to check it out

21:43.526 --> 21:46.791
But by the time he got there,
there was no sign of her or her car.

21:46.826 --> 21:49.926
And speaking of vanishing vehicles,
I'm still looking for Alex Harrison's.

21:51.726 --> 21:54.426
We're standing in the
middle of 3 million acres.

21:55.026 --> 21:56.426
She could be anywhere.

21:56.726 --> 21:59.326
We've only got 2 murder
sites, miles apart.

21:59.361 --> 22:01.091
There's no pattern yet.

22:01.126 --> 22:03.991
Both sites are low lying, they
could be tracked from above.

22:04.026 --> 22:08.026
Maybe there are blinds built into
the trees, or at least access to them.

22:08.126 --> 22:10.926
With good vantage points they
could see their prey for miles.

22:14.626 --> 22:17.126
Why'd we have to bring all this
stuff? Anyone head of Beenie Wenie?

22:17.161 --> 22:19.143
We're not 10 anymore.

22:19.178 --> 22:21.252
Help! Help me! Help me!

22:21.287 --> 22:23.291
Help, they're coming.

22:23.326 --> 22:25.726
- Who? -
There-there's 2 guys.

22:25.761 --> 22:26.826
They're trying to kill me.

22:29.026 --> 22:30.426
Oh, my god

22:30.461 --> 22:32.026
Joe

22:34.326 --> 22:35.926
Run!

22:40.926 --> 22:43.426
She's really a lot
faster than we thought.

22:43.461 --> 22:45.526
Yeah, now it's going to get fun.

22:57.542 --> 22:59.007
Stop, I can't keep up.

22:59.042 --> 23:00.642
You stay the hell away from her!

23:01.042 --> 23:03.042
Hey, um, look...

23:03.142 --> 23:05.442
I'm really sorry about what
happened to your friends, ok?

23:05.542 --> 23:09.842
Our friends are dead, and those
guys chasing you weren't after us.

23:09.877 --> 23:12.142
Well, it doesn't look like it
mattered much to them, did it?

23:12.442 --> 23:14.892
Look, all I know is if she's
around we could be next.

23:14.927 --> 23:17.684
What are we supposed to do?
Leave her for those maniacs?

23:17.719 --> 23:20.442
We don't know who she is! What
if she did something to them?

23:20.477 --> 23:22.807
2 psychos abducted me. All right?

23:22.842 --> 23:24.942
The next thing I know, I'm
running for my life in the woods.

23:24.977 --> 23:26.207
Yeah, that's your story.

23:26.242 --> 23:28.642
All right, look, we're
gonna lose daylight.

23:28.742 --> 23:32.942
We got 2 choices, we can either stick
together or, or we go our own way.

23:33.942 --> 23:36.042
- We should stick together.
- What?

23:38.142 --> 23:40.242
You just be sure to keep
a good distance between us.

23:41.342 --> 23:45.442
Instead of referring to me as she
and you, try using my first name.

23:45.477 --> 23:47.742
Look, I don't want to know your name.

23:48.342 --> 23:50.942
If anything else happens, I don't want
to feel like I ever knew you at all.

23:53.542 --> 23:54.607
What have you got?

23:54.642 --> 24:00.042
Uh, there are 3 stores outside Spokane that sell
the exact type of arrows you were looking for.

24:00.077 --> 24:03.942
And before you ask, of course I've already
sent the addresses to your handheld.

24:03.977 --> 24:05.909
Garcia? You're the man.

24:05.944 --> 24:07.842
Oh, no. You're the man.

24:11.442 --> 24:14.742
Do you keep records to document
who buys hunting arrows?

24:15.042 --> 24:17.642
After a week we only keep receipts
if they pay by credit card.

24:17.677 --> 24:20.409
You get a lot of repeat
business up here, don't you?

24:20.444 --> 24:23.142
Every year people get
their ammo and supplies here

24:23.177 --> 24:24.959
Before headin' up to the mountains.

24:24.994 --> 24:26.818
Uh, groups of men? Like, uh...

24:26.853 --> 24:28.642
- Fathers and sons?
- Sure.

24:29.342 --> 24:32.642
Can I ask you gentlemen,
why is this a police matter?

24:32.842 --> 24:34.807
We're looking for 2
men, possibly related.

24:34.842 --> 24:38.807
You might remember them because
one always does all the talking,

24:38.842 --> 24:41.442
And the other one would become very
uncomfortable if you spoke to him.

24:41.477 --> 24:44.442
It'd be even worse if
that person were a female.

24:44.942 --> 24:49.342
Well, there are these 2 brothers
that have been coming here for years.

24:49.642 --> 24:52.642
They got some supplies
here a few days ago.

24:53.642 --> 24:56.707
The younger one's so painfully
shy, it's almost sweet.

24:56.742 --> 25:00.192
And after all these years, he
still hasn't warmed up to me.

25:00.227 --> 25:03.642
Their uncle was a quiet man,
he passed away some time ago.

25:03.677 --> 25:05.842
- You find a receipt?
- No, they paid in cash.

25:07.042 --> 25:09.242
I'm pretty sure their name was Mulford.

25:09.277 --> 25:11.407
I think their uncle's name was Joe.

25:11.442 --> 25:13.642
- Thank you very much.
- I'll call Garcia.

25:17.442 --> 25:20.542
Garcia, I need everything you
have on a man named Joseph Mulford.

25:20.842 --> 25:26.042
Ok, it says here Joseph Mulford was
convicted of multiple assault and batteries.

25:26.842 --> 25:30.242
He owned a service station, but it
changed hands when he passed away.

25:30.277 --> 25:32.759
He gave it to his nephews,
Paul and John Mulford.

25:32.794 --> 25:35.242
I don't have to ask
where it's located, do I?

25:35.277 --> 25:36.207
No, you don't.

25:36.242 --> 25:39.742
But since you did, gorgeous grey matter, I'll
have you know, I'm pulling it up right now.

25:40.042 --> 25:41.942
And the computer says...

25:42.942 --> 25:44.742
- What is it?
- That service station...

25:44.777 --> 25:46.907
It's located on highway 2.

25:46.942 --> 25:48.842
Let me guess, close to where
our victims have gone missing?

25:48.877 --> 25:50.342
Bulls-eye.

25:52.142 --> 25:53.907
Still no sign of Bobbi Baird.

25:53.942 --> 25:55.542
Search teams are in until morning.

25:55.577 --> 25:57.107
We're running out of time.

25:57.142 --> 25:59.392
It's getting dark, I don't
know what else we can do.

25:59.427 --> 26:01.734
Well, you never know how
someone's going to react

26:01.769 --> 26:04.007
When they're forced into
circumstances like these.

26:04.042 --> 26:07.542
If Bobbi's still alive, we just have to
hope she's found a safe place for the night.

26:13.842 --> 26:15.542
Just, uh, stay close.
It'll keep us warm.

26:16.542 --> 26:18.342
Did you hear that?

26:18.942 --> 26:20.742
Why don't you turn off the
light, so they can't see us?

26:20.777 --> 26:22.742
It's probably just an
animal or something.

26:22.777 --> 26:24.842
Well, something's not good.

26:29.242 --> 26:31.142
Whatever that noise is,
it's right behind us.

26:31.442 --> 26:33.342
Footsteps are too light to be them.

26:33.842 --> 26:36.542
If they were that close,
they-they'd just shoot us.

26:42.242 --> 26:44.142
Look at them, they look pretty scared.

26:44.177 --> 26:45.307
We should take them now.

26:45.342 --> 26:47.607
No, we wait till first light.

26:47.642 --> 26:50.142
It's more fun when
they're not expecting it.

26:50.177 --> 26:51.742
All right.

27:17.042 --> 27:19.007
We've got a missing person's report.

27:19.042 --> 27:21.442
2 couples camping over the
weekend didn't show up for work

27:21.477 --> 27:23.442
and they didn't check
out with the rangers.

27:24.042 --> 27:25.742
I'll organize a search and rescue.

27:25.777 --> 27:26.707
Where was their campsite?

27:26.742 --> 27:29.142
Several miles from where Alex
Harrison's body was found.

27:29.177 --> 27:31.007
Do we think there's a connection?

27:31.042 --> 27:34.042
Well, if these hunters are looking
for more challenges, absolutely.

27:34.742 --> 27:36.107
Let's go.

27:36.142 --> 27:38.642
It's still not open, how convenient.

27:42.242 --> 27:43.942
Let's take a look around.

27:56.542 --> 27:59.042
It's clear

28:07.242 --> 28:08.507
It's a mustang.

28:08.542 --> 28:10.442
Same make and model as Bobbi Baird.

28:10.477 --> 28:12.442
These are definitely our guys.

28:12.842 --> 28:16.442
No animal did this. That depends
on your definition of animal.

28:17.742 --> 28:20.142
Looks like somebody
shredded it with a knife.

28:20.542 --> 28:22.742
All the supplies have
been dumped, not eaten.

28:23.142 --> 28:25.942
They wanted to make sure if
anyone found their way back here

28:25.977 --> 28:27.407
everything would be worthless.

28:27.442 --> 28:29.792
Blood on the ground, 2
spots, here and there.

28:29.827 --> 28:32.142
Hey, guys, we've got
blood over here, too.

28:32.642 --> 28:35.142
Ok, if I'm standing right
up there, this is wide open,

28:35.242 --> 28:36.992
and I've got a clear
shot at these victims.

28:37.027 --> 28:38.707
It would explain all
the blood on the ground.

28:38.742 --> 28:41.242
- What about over here?
- That's another clear shot.

28:41.642 --> 28:43.842
So, what do we think happened?

28:43.877 --> 28:46.042
2 pools of blood, I say 2 victims.

28:46.077 --> 28:47.842
Could be the campers.

28:48.242 --> 28:50.142
Uh, question is, where are they now?

28:51.242 --> 28:53.242
What is that?

29:18.204 --> 29:21.204
They've already got one victim in these
woods, why'd they attack this couple?

29:22.704 --> 29:24.304
Well, maybe they had to.

29:25.104 --> 29:26.804
Bobbi Baird's their target

29:27.304 --> 29:31.104
if she ran towards voices, well, she
had to come right through this camp.

29:31.139 --> 29:33.704
These people were in the
wrong place at the wrong time.

29:34.504 --> 29:36.504
They weren't supposed to die.

29:37.904 --> 29:39.304
No, just got in the way.

29:40.204 --> 29:42.904
Hotch found Bobbi Baird's car
at Mulford's service station.

29:42.939 --> 29:44.669
Hiding them in plain sight.

29:44.704 --> 29:47.204
- It's run by 2 brothers
- You heard of the Mulfords?

29:47.704 --> 29:49.869
We go by first name basis around here.

29:49.904 --> 29:52.704
But you tell me what they're
driving, my people will find it.

30:02.904 --> 30:04.304
Oh, my god.

30:06.104 --> 30:07.704
- Oh, did you see that?
- Oh, ho ho ho!

30:08.804 --> 30:11.404
Luke, look at me!
Come on! Don't do this!

30:11.704 --> 30:13.304
Help me stop it!

30:14.404 --> 30:16.604
There you go! Told you
you'd get your first buck.

30:17.004 --> 30:19.504
- We gotta go!
- I cannot leave him out here alone!

30:23.704 --> 30:25.704
Come on, heather. Come on.

30:26.304 --> 30:27.704
I can't just leave him.

30:27.804 --> 30:29.504
- Go!
- Come on!

30:30.204 --> 30:32.204
- Go. Go.
- We gotta go.

30:36.604 --> 30:38.204
Come on!

30:46.404 --> 30:48.004
Come on, it's too easy.

30:48.039 --> 30:49.269
Oh, my god.

30:49.304 --> 30:51.104
Come on! Come on!

30:53.904 --> 30:55.504
All right, let's go.

30:56.604 --> 30:57.569
So, what'd they do?

30:57.604 --> 31:00.304
Just patrol the highway,
looking for broken down cars?

31:02.204 --> 31:04.004
We've got a 210 in progress.

31:04.604 --> 31:07.004
- Picked up dispatches.
- Hey, Hotch!

31:07.504 --> 31:09.404
You should see this.

31:10.004 --> 31:12.804
- Hey, what color was Alex Harrison's car?
- It's blue, why?

31:13.304 --> 31:15.704
I think we found it,
along with some others.

31:18.104 --> 31:20.404
If all these have cars...

31:21.804 --> 31:24.304
We're looking at a lot more victims.

31:27.804 --> 31:30.204
I got at least 3 sets
of footprints here.

31:30.604 --> 31:32.004
I lose them in the pine needles.

31:32.104 --> 31:33.904
They pick back up over here.

31:34.304 --> 31:36.854
Ok, Evans, can we get
your team to help us out?

31:36.889 --> 31:39.404
Yeah, bunting! Help these
agents follow the tracks.

31:40.404 --> 31:43.204
Everybody in before sundown!

32:06.504 --> 32:08.304
Guys, look at this.

32:11.804 --> 32:15.404
- First one expired in 1980.
- Boys weren't even born yet.

32:15.504 --> 32:19.204
The uncle must have started the killing,
the boys have continued the tradition.

32:26.904 --> 32:29.004
What are you doing?

32:29.704 --> 32:32.604
- I don't know where we're going.
- We can't just stop.

32:35.804 --> 32:38.904
It's part of their game.
They love the chase.

32:39.804 --> 32:42.104
As long as we're running, we're
just giving them what they want.

32:42.504 --> 32:45.404
We don't get the hell out of here
right now, we're both going to die.

32:46.504 --> 32:48.404
Not necessarily.

32:48.504 --> 32:52.504
Paul and John Mulford, 26 and
22, were orphaned as toddlers.

32:52.804 --> 32:53.904
Abandonment issues.

32:54.004 --> 32:57.004
State kept them together by finding
their only living relative, their uncle.

32:57.304 --> 33:00.504
He raised his nephews completely off
the grid. They never went to school

33:00.539 --> 33:02.904
No socialization other than
the patrons of the station.

33:02.939 --> 33:04.871
He was drafted in 1968.

33:04.906 --> 33:06.769
He was only 18 years old.

33:06.804 --> 33:10.404
He was relieved from duty 2 years later,
reports of hallucinations and delusions.

33:10.804 --> 33:14.069
The boys were raised with no social
compass by the only relative they ever knew.

33:14.104 --> 33:18.204
Psychotic possessed with bizarre beliefs,
who taught them how to hunt and who to kill.

33:18.504 --> 33:19.669
Look at this.

33:19.704 --> 33:21.804
They've been hunting in
those woods their whole lives.

33:29.304 --> 33:31.104
It's from her sweater.

34:10.504 --> 34:12.704
******

34:28.804 --> 34:31.103
No! Don't!

34:52.704 --> 34:54.204
I'm sorry.

35:09.004 --> 35:11.604
Whoa, ok, ok. It's ok. It's ok.

35:11.904 --> 35:13.069
You're ok. You're ok.

35:13.104 --> 35:14.704
Johnny, Johnny! Look at me! Look at me!

35:22.204 --> 35:24.304
It's oK. It's ok.

35:32.830 --> 35:35.930
I found the I.D. s of
Joel and taylor brause

35:35.965 --> 35:37.630
2 of the missing campers.

35:37.930 --> 35:39.230
- Married?
- Yeah.

35:40.230 --> 35:42.130
This is agent Morgan, go for Gideon.

35:43.430 --> 35:44.895
Gideon here, where are you?

35:44.930 --> 35:48.130
We followed the tracks for several miles,
and now we can see something in the distance.

35:48.730 --> 35:50.230
Can you get to higher ground?

35:56.930 --> 35:59.730
- You see it?
- Smoke.

36:03.830 --> 36:07.330
You're all right. It's
gonna be all right.

36:08.030 --> 36:11.330
- I don't think so!
- I know-I know so.

36:11.830 --> 36:13.930
But you gotta be strong.

36:17.230 --> 36:20.030
It's a lot of blood. It's just
a lot of blood, it's all right.

36:20.065 --> 36:22.495
Oh, god, please, no...

36:22.530 --> 36:25.595
I'm gonna go take care
of that friend of ours

36:25.630 --> 36:30.230
then I'm gonna come back, come back and
we're gonna get you fixed up as good as new.

36:30.730 --> 36:33.430
- I promise, I promise.
- Ok.

36:45.830 --> 36:48.530
Where are you, you son of a bitch?

36:49.930 --> 36:52.230
I'm tired of running!

36:52.530 --> 36:55.730
You're a coward, just like your brother.

36:59.830 --> 37:02.530
I see the fire. It's
right through those trees.

37:03.330 --> 37:05.380
There's a man lying next to it.

37:05.415 --> 37:07.430
Could just be a couple campers.

37:08.530 --> 37:10.530
Let's be prepared if it isn't.

37:11.230 --> 37:12.930
F.B.I.

37:13.830 --> 37:15.730
He's covered in blood.

37:18.630 --> 37:21.430
- We gotta get him out of here.
- I'll call for an evac.

37:21.530 --> 37:23.095
Son, can you hear me?

37:23.130 --> 37:25.430
My name's jason Gideon,
we're with the F.B.I.

37:25.465 --> 37:28.130
We're gonna get you out of here. Ok?

37:28.930 --> 37:31.730
Can you hear me? Are you here alone?

37:33.730 --> 37:36.030
Over there.

37:51.730 --> 37:53.830
She's gone.

38:20.830 --> 38:23.330
- It's a woman.
- She was shot with an arrow.

38:23.630 --> 38:26.430
There's a compound bow about
25 feet away from the body.

38:28.030 --> 38:31.630
What? The other victims
were shot in the chest area.

38:32.930 --> 38:34.680
This boy has wounds
in his lower abdomen.

38:34.715 --> 38:36.430
You don't think he
was shot with an arrow?

38:36.465 --> 38:38.530
It looks like he was stabbed.

38:39.630 --> 38:41.095
Son...

38:41.130 --> 38:43.430
Are the men who did this
to you still in the woods?

38:45.330 --> 38:47.930
We have a team of F.B.I.
Agents looking for them.

38:47.965 --> 38:48.895
It's all right.

38:48.930 --> 38:50.530
They've got an order
to shoot if necessary.

38:50.565 --> 38:51.930
- No! No, no, no.
- It's ok, it's ok!

38:53.230 --> 38:55.330
You are safe-
you are safe here.

38:55.365 --> 38:57.530
Don't shoot him!

38:58.230 --> 39:00.795
He's all I have.

39:00.830 --> 39:02.930
Is your brother out there?

39:04.230 --> 39:07.195
- What's your name?
- Johnny.

39:07.230 --> 39:10.095
Johnny, you need to
tell us where Paul is.

39:10.130 --> 39:13.230
Before it's too late.
Just tell me where he is.

39:13.530 --> 39:15.230
Tell me where he is.

39:37.030 --> 39:39.430
- He said about half a mile due east.
- Let's go.

40:19.330 --> 40:21.380
Paul Mulford! F.B.I.

40:21.415 --> 40:23.430
Put down your weapon!

40:26.730 --> 40:28.995
No!

40:29.030 --> 40:32.530
It's ok, it's ok. It's ok, it's ok.

40:42.030 --> 40:43.930
He's clean.

40:45.330 --> 40:47.030
Johnny...

40:47.130 --> 40:51.130
it's ok, it's ok.

41:12.830 --> 41:14.780
- You got him?
- Yeah.

41:14.815 --> 41:16.730
I'm going to call Gideon.

41:18.930 --> 41:21.230
- Is he dead?
- Soon.

41:23.930 --> 41:26.430
How can these guys do
something like this?

41:28.230 --> 41:30.730
Because they don't
think like you and me.

41:38.430 --> 41:41.330
How does it feel, you son of a bitch?

41:41.365 --> 41:44.030
Looks like I had all the fun.

41:48.430 --> 41:53.830
<i>Awful people they surround you</i>

41:59.630 --> 42:04.430
<i>ain't they just like monsters</i>

42:08.430 --> 42:11.230
<i>they come to feed on us</i>

42:12.230 --> 42:16.330
<i>giant little animals for us</i>

42:21.030 --> 42:23.930
The british historian James
Anthony Froud once said

42:23.965 --> 42:27.195
wild animals never kill for sport.

42:27.230 --> 42:29.895
Man is the only one
to whom the torture and

42:29.930 --> 42:33.930
death of his fellow creatures
is amusing in itself.

42:43.530 --> 42:45.230
You ok?

42:48.330 --> 42:51.030
- I've never seen you
look so, um- - Quiet.

42:54.130 --> 42:56.095
What's up?

42:56.130 --> 42:59.330
Bobbi Baird asked me a question
that's sticking with me.

43:00.630 --> 43:02.330
What was it?

43:02.930 --> 43:05.230
She asked me how they could do it.

43:05.265 --> 43:06.895
How those men could...

43:06.930 --> 43:09.430
hunt and kill people in the woods.

43:11.730 --> 43:13.395
What did you tell her?

43:13.430 --> 43:15.430
That they don't think like we do.

43:16.230 --> 43:18.930
But... the truth is...

43:20.330 --> 43:22.930
that we do think like them.

43:25.930 --> 43:28.630
Yeah, we do.

43:28.930 --> 43:30.730
Because it's our job.

43:31.730 --> 43:33.730
We need to know how it feels.

43:35.830 --> 43:39.030
We hunt these people every day.

43:40.830 --> 43:43.830
The question is, how different are we?

43:43.865 --> 43:45.830
Us and them?
