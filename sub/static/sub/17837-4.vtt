.

00:06.507 --> 00:07.408
BOB LEE:
Previously on "Shooter"...

00:09.243 --> 00:10.511
I never should have
saved your ass in Musa Qala.

00:10.544 --> 00:11.512
As I recall,
you disobeyed a direct order.

00:11.545 --> 00:13.481
FBI, everybody down!

00:13.514 --> 00:15.583
Dmitri!
Homeland, we got here first.

00:15.616 --> 00:17.785
That's six months of work
you're loading into that van.

00:17.818 --> 00:19.053
I think we got him.
He sent flowers every year

00:19.087 --> 00:20.588
to the mom of his dead spotter.

00:20.621 --> 00:23.291
In the garage is Donny's
motorcycle and his field box.

00:23.324 --> 00:24.492
I'll keep 'em away
as long as I can.

00:24.525 --> 00:26.127
You can't just go back there!

00:26.160 --> 00:27.828
AGENT BOSACK: We found Swagger.

00:27.861 --> 00:29.363
ISAAC: He was at Mount Baker
less than an hour ago.

00:29.397 --> 00:30.364
Get your men and get out there.

00:30.398 --> 00:31.432
[gunshot]

00:32.433 --> 00:33.567
[gunshot]

00:36.570 --> 00:39.140
That's a titanium hip.
There's a serial number on here

00:39.173 --> 00:40.274
that should match Bob Lee's.

00:40.308 --> 00:41.842
Congratulations.
We got him.

00:41.875 --> 00:43.277
JACK: How do we know he's dead?

00:43.311 --> 00:45.646
Because I did my job well,
Payne.

00:45.679 --> 00:49.117
Do you remember the story Daddy
told you about Musa Qala?

00:49.150 --> 00:51.119
[whispering]
Daddy had to be a ghost.

00:51.152 --> 00:52.353
[exhales]

00:54.422 --> 00:55.656
[car horn honks]

00:55.689 --> 00:59.059
[indistinct chatter]

01:19.180 --> 01:21.682
[exhales sharply]
Good Lord, it's hot out here.

01:21.715 --> 01:23.584
We need to move this war,
Bob Lee.

01:23.617 --> 01:25.386
Yeah, buddy.

01:25.419 --> 01:27.321
MAN: This is Raider Six Seven,
Raider Six Seven.

01:27.355 --> 01:29.623
Cowboy Alpha, posting village
to Delta, over.

01:29.657 --> 01:32.626
[trucks rumble]

01:32.660 --> 01:35.863
[tense music]

01:35.896 --> 01:38.566
*

01:38.599 --> 01:40.901
DONNY: Raider One Three Actual,
this is Raider One Three Bravo,

01:40.934 --> 01:42.303
We have eyes
on the supply convoy.

01:42.336 --> 01:44.605
Town is clear at this time.
Continuing to observe, over.

01:44.638 --> 01:47.341
Roger that, One Three Bravo.

01:47.375 --> 01:49.610
You watch over them
and I'll watch over you.

01:49.643 --> 01:51.345
Stay safe and keep me advised.

01:51.379 --> 01:52.613
Actual, out.

01:52.646 --> 01:54.215
Rahim,

01:54.248 --> 01:55.616
you certain
that this town is friendly?

01:55.649 --> 01:58.486
Nothing is certain in
Afghanistan, Captain Johnson.

01:58.519 --> 01:59.653
No shit.

01:59.687 --> 02:02.356
[indistinct chatter]

02:02.390 --> 02:04.158
Still clear.

02:04.192 --> 02:06.194
*

02:06.227 --> 02:08.229
Man, something doesn't
feel right.

02:08.262 --> 02:09.697
DONNY: Ah, shit.

02:09.730 --> 02:11.432
Now I owe Perkins ten bucks.

02:11.465 --> 02:13.201
I figured we'd be out here
at least an hour

02:13.234 --> 02:15.236
before you start talking
about your damn feelings.

02:15.269 --> 02:17.305
[chuckles softly]

02:22.276 --> 02:23.477
BOB LEE: I got a peeker.

02:23.511 --> 02:26.247
Top window, my 2:00,
behind a brown curtain.

02:26.280 --> 02:27.915
Cell phone?

02:27.948 --> 02:30.251
BOB LEE: Can't tell.
He dipped back in the dark.

02:30.284 --> 02:31.619
Does not bode well.

02:31.652 --> 02:33.621
All right,
I range that window at 320.

02:33.654 --> 02:36.357
There's a little wind
down there.

02:36.390 --> 02:38.226
Got a vehicle approaching
from the south.

02:38.259 --> 02:40.594
Hauling ass, headed towards
One Three Bravo's FFP.

02:40.628 --> 02:42.530
One Three Bravo, you got
a truckload of hostiles

02:42.563 --> 02:44.398
heading in the direction
of your FFP,

02:44.432 --> 02:45.699
coming straight from the south.

02:45.733 --> 02:47.368
Acknowledge, over.

02:47.401 --> 02:48.569
What you wanna do, boss?

02:48.602 --> 02:49.670
We're not moving.

02:49.703 --> 02:51.505
Your man must move
or he will die.

02:51.539 --> 02:54.275
You've been compromised,
abort the mission now, over.

02:54.308 --> 02:56.544
*

02:56.577 --> 02:58.279
Bob Lee, I know you hear me,
goddamn it.

02:58.312 --> 02:59.480
Abort, over.

02:59.513 --> 03:00.581
Bob Lee...

03:00.614 --> 03:01.749
There are 12 marines
in that convoy.

03:01.782 --> 03:02.750
Disregard the radio

03:02.783 --> 03:04.285
and get ready for a gunfight.

03:04.318 --> 03:05.553
I'll join you when I can.

03:05.586 --> 03:07.355
Maybe the next mission
will be boring.

03:07.388 --> 03:08.989
Don't take too long.

03:09.022 --> 03:15.563
*

03:15.596 --> 03:17.431
[man speaking indistinctly]

03:17.465 --> 03:19.300
Cowboy Alpha approaching
checkpoint Charlie, over.

or loss of life, over.

[exciting dramatic music]

04:08.482 --> 04:16.524
*

04:24.798 --> 04:26.334
Move in.

04:27.401 --> 04:28.536
Move.

04:28.569 --> 04:29.603
Care package, ladies.

04:29.637 --> 04:30.638
Courtesy of Mama Fenn.

04:30.671 --> 04:32.506
Mama send your Joe-Joe's?

04:32.540 --> 04:34.875
Oh, God, making fun of me
about my Joe-Joe's, man.

04:34.908 --> 04:36.444
Y'all should have seen him
out there

04:36.477 --> 04:37.878
shaking like a little sissy.

04:37.911 --> 04:40.781
"Oh, my God, there's
a shitload of guys coming.

04:40.814 --> 04:42.783
What the hell are we doing,
Donny?"

04:42.816 --> 04:44.785
Luckily, I held it down,
kept him safe

04:44.818 --> 04:46.587
long enough for him
to get a shot off.

04:46.620 --> 04:48.656
Is there a stronger word
than "hero," fellas?

04:48.689 --> 04:50.558
This coming from a guy
with a chest full of medals.

04:50.591 --> 04:52.393
You got room for one more,
Nailer?

04:52.426 --> 04:55.329
I'm just glad I got him
before he got the convoy.

04:55.363 --> 04:57.465
What's going on, fellas?

04:57.498 --> 04:59.667
At ease.

04:59.700 --> 05:01.702
Doing a little after-action
review of the mission?

05:01.735 --> 05:03.737
No, sir.
I was just telling the guys

05:03.771 --> 05:04.872
how we lost comms with you

05:04.905 --> 05:06.807
when our radio malfunctioned
out there.

05:06.840 --> 05:08.542
Right.

05:08.576 --> 05:10.511
I'm actually relieved
to hear that

05:10.544 --> 05:12.346
'cause I was worried
that two of my marines

05:12.380 --> 05:14.848
disobeyed a direct order
to abort the mission.

05:14.882 --> 05:16.850
I'm glad that wasn't the case.

05:16.884 --> 05:19.420
So who didn't
maintain radio properly?

05:21.555 --> 05:23.824
Was it you, Fenn?

05:23.857 --> 05:25.426
It was my fault, sir.

05:25.459 --> 05:27.395
I forgot to clean it
before we headed out.

05:27.428 --> 05:30.431
Mm, I'll tell you what,

05:30.464 --> 05:31.699
why don't you
go on over to commo

05:31.732 --> 05:33.434
and clean the team radios
tonight.

05:33.467 --> 05:35.135
I'd hate to have
another radio malfunction

05:35.168 --> 05:37.104
during the next mission.

05:37.137 --> 05:38.572
Somebody could get killed.

05:38.606 --> 05:40.408
Sir.

05:43.611 --> 05:46.480
Well, damn, that's the thanks
you get for saving the convoy?

05:46.514 --> 05:48.782
[exhales]
Guess so.

05:48.816 --> 05:51.785
[dramatic music]

06:06.434 --> 06:06.734
.

06:06.767 --> 06:07.200
Agent Memphis, hey.

06:08.035 --> 06:09.503
Matt Simms, Homeland.

06:09.537 --> 06:11.972
We--we, uh--we met.

06:12.005 --> 06:13.807
Yeah, the night
you took Voydian.

06:13.841 --> 06:15.776
Yeah, yeah, sorry about that,
ma'am.

06:15.809 --> 06:17.110
Orders.
You understand.

06:17.144 --> 06:18.679
You can cut the "ma'am" shit.

06:18.712 --> 06:20.948
I've been a special agent
for six years.

06:20.981 --> 06:23.183
Look, I need to speak
to Voydian.

06:23.216 --> 06:26.787
Yeah, I thought this might be
about Dmitri Voydian.

06:26.820 --> 06:29.923
He's not gonna be
of any use to you.

06:29.957 --> 06:31.759
Why?

06:31.792 --> 06:34.094
Ugh, what did you,
cut him a deal?

06:34.127 --> 06:37.798
Grant him immunity?
No, no, Voydian's dead.

06:38.899 --> 06:40.434
[sighs]
Our intel shows him murdered

06:40.468 --> 06:43.904
by the Russian
Foreign Intelligence Service.

06:46.039 --> 06:48.041
Wait, SVR?

06:48.075 --> 06:49.810
No way, this is too messy,

06:49.843 --> 06:51.979
and to leave him
out in the open like this.

06:52.012 --> 06:53.914
This is a message.

06:53.947 --> 06:56.450
Well, maybe it was
and maybe it wasn't.

06:56.484 --> 06:59.186
Either way, it's over now.

06:59.219 --> 07:01.822
Wait.
Um...

07:01.855 --> 07:04.458
Did Voydian have
any connection at all

07:04.492 --> 07:07.094
to Bob Lee Swagger?
[laughs]

07:07.127 --> 07:08.862
What the hell are
you talking about?

07:08.896 --> 07:10.531
Swagger was the lone gunman.

07:10.564 --> 07:12.132
He squeezed the trigger,
but I think other people

07:12.165 --> 07:14.034
might have been
pulling his strings.

07:14.067 --> 07:15.969
Huh.

07:16.003 --> 07:17.805
Does your boss have you
looking into that?

07:17.838 --> 07:20.173
Just something I'm trying
to connect the dots on.

07:20.207 --> 07:21.942
You gonna answer my question?

07:21.975 --> 07:24.144
Well, I haven't
seen any evidence

07:24.177 --> 07:28.048
suggesting a connection between
Voydian and Swagger, but...

07:28.081 --> 07:31.519
well, stranger things
have been true.

07:34.187 --> 07:36.023
Let's start over.

07:36.056 --> 07:39.527
You show me
how they might be connected,

07:39.560 --> 07:41.495
and I'll give you
any Homeland intel

07:41.529 --> 07:44.031
that backs you up.

07:44.064 --> 07:47.034
[soft tense music]

07:47.067 --> 07:50.838
*

07:50.871 --> 07:52.840
You here to chew me out
for real now?

07:52.873 --> 07:56.777
[scoffs]
Think that'd help?

07:56.810 --> 07:59.212
Nah, what I wanna know is:

07:59.246 --> 08:01.114
Did you really think
it was smart of you

08:01.148 --> 08:04.051
to disobey me out there?

08:04.084 --> 08:05.619
I think the bad guys are dead

08:05.653 --> 08:08.556
and I'm sitting here
with you now.

08:11.859 --> 08:14.294
How long was that shot you took?

08:14.327 --> 08:15.295
320.

08:15.328 --> 08:16.864
Wind?

08:16.897 --> 08:18.799
West, about seven knots.

08:18.832 --> 08:20.634
You aim at the grenade?

08:20.668 --> 08:22.836
Just the tip.
[chuckles]

08:22.870 --> 08:24.538
Hmm.

08:24.572 --> 08:27.274
So in short,
that was one hell of a shot.

08:27.307 --> 08:29.209
That it was.

08:35.182 --> 08:37.551
You think the enemy
feels the same?

08:38.986 --> 08:41.088
I don't really give a shit
what the enemy thinks.

08:41.121 --> 08:42.856
Well, I do.

08:42.890 --> 08:45.959
In fact, that's almost
all I think about,

08:45.993 --> 08:49.162
and now they know that the great
Bob the Nailer is here,

08:49.196 --> 08:52.566
at this forward operating base.

08:54.034 --> 08:57.337
You know how much
your bounty's up to?

08:57.370 --> 08:59.673
Last I heard, 600,000.

08:59.707 --> 09:02.109
You keep getting spotted
on your infil,

09:02.142 --> 09:04.578
pretty soon the Navy chaplain's
gonna be talking to Julie.

09:04.612 --> 09:06.279
We weren't spotted, Captain.

09:06.313 --> 09:08.215
Those guys weren't on patrol,
Bob Lee.

09:08.248 --> 09:09.917
They were coming
right after you.

09:09.950 --> 09:12.219
We all saw it.

09:12.252 --> 09:14.888
Respectfully disagree.

09:14.922 --> 09:17.124
Either way, I wasn't gonna let
the convo get popped

09:17.157 --> 09:19.292
to save my own ass.

09:19.326 --> 09:22.262
Right.

09:22.295 --> 09:24.598
Well, this is my opinion

09:24.632 --> 09:28.035
as your commander
and as your friend,

09:28.068 --> 09:30.370
you gotta think big picture.

09:30.403 --> 09:32.906
And before you come back
with some smart ass comment,

09:32.940 --> 09:33.974
remember this:

09:34.007 --> 09:35.275
It's a hell of a lot easier

09:35.308 --> 09:37.044
to replace some truck driver

09:37.077 --> 09:39.279
than it is the top sniper
in the Marine Corps.

09:39.312 --> 09:41.048
Slash radio cleaner.

09:41.081 --> 09:42.950
[chuckles softly]

09:42.983 --> 09:44.618
There's a lot more to this war

09:44.652 --> 09:46.286
than what you see
through your rifle scope.

09:46.319 --> 09:49.289
[soft dramatic music]

09:49.322 --> 09:50.724
*

09:50.758 --> 09:52.159
[grunts]

09:52.192 --> 09:54.294
Oh...

09:54.327 --> 09:56.664
make sure you share that
with Donny.

09:56.697 --> 09:58.298
He saved your ass today.

09:58.331 --> 10:00.668
*

10:00.701 --> 10:02.202
[grunts]

10:02.235 --> 10:04.271
JULIE: Bob Lee was a believer.

10:04.304 --> 10:07.641
He believed in his family
and his friends.

10:07.675 --> 10:10.678
He believed in the men
who fought bravely beside him.

10:12.079 --> 10:14.682
He believed in honor

10:14.715 --> 10:17.317
and loyalty and truth.

10:17.350 --> 10:19.119
So whatever the world

10:19.152 --> 10:21.755
wants to think
or believe,

10:21.789 --> 10:25.092
we know they're not talking
about the man we love.

10:26.359 --> 10:29.997
Each of us has had the privilege

10:30.030 --> 10:32.065
of sharing a part of our lives

10:32.099 --> 10:34.234
with Bob Lee.

10:34.267 --> 10:36.369
We know what it feels like

10:36.403 --> 10:39.306
to have him watching over us,

10:39.339 --> 10:42.075
protecting us

10:42.109 --> 10:44.778
because that's who he was.

10:44.812 --> 10:46.980
He couldn't help it,

10:47.014 --> 10:49.149
and I take great comfort
in that.

11:03.764 --> 11:06.099
I know this is hard,

11:06.133 --> 11:10.003
but Bob Lee is with my Donny
right now in heaven.

11:10.037 --> 11:12.072
[emotionally]
Yes.

11:13.440 --> 11:16.676
[muffled indistinct chatter]

11:18.245 --> 11:20.147
Oh, my God.

11:20.180 --> 11:22.482
It was a good idea
not to bring Mary.

11:22.515 --> 11:24.451
How--how long can they
keep this up?

11:24.484 --> 11:26.787
He's dead now.
They'll move on eventually.

11:26.820 --> 11:28.021
Jim.

11:29.289 --> 11:30.490
That came out the wrong way.
I'm sorry.

11:30.523 --> 11:33.026
No, it's okay.
You're right.

11:33.060 --> 11:35.796
I'm sure that Mary and I
can get back to our house

11:35.829 --> 11:37.831
now that Bob Lee's gone.

11:37.865 --> 11:39.266
You guys stay here.

11:39.299 --> 11:41.001
I'm gonna try to appeal
to their human side.

11:41.034 --> 11:42.102
Maybe they'll go away.

11:42.135 --> 11:43.336
We'll take care of it.

11:43.370 --> 11:45.272
[cameras clicking]
JIM: Hey, assholes.

11:45.305 --> 11:47.140
[indistinct shouting]

11:47.174 --> 11:49.342
This could get interesting.

11:49.376 --> 11:51.211
What's a matter?

11:51.244 --> 11:53.480
You still think he's not dead?

11:53.513 --> 11:56.049
There's lots of parts, no body.

11:56.850 --> 11:59.286
It's not even 10:00 a.m.

11:59.319 --> 12:01.755
What are you, my sponsor?

12:01.789 --> 12:03.290
DNA checked out.

12:03.323 --> 12:04.792
The serial number
on the hip checked out.

12:04.825 --> 12:07.160
If he faked it, it was smart.

12:07.194 --> 12:08.328
Either way, doesn't matter.

12:08.361 --> 12:10.530
He's dead
as far as the Russians know.

12:10.563 --> 12:12.399
Well, wh--why are we here?

12:12.432 --> 12:14.267
[clicks tongue]

12:14.301 --> 12:15.402
ISAAC: Oh, you can
leave it alone.

12:15.435 --> 12:17.104
Bob Lee's wife isn't gonna talk.

12:17.137 --> 12:18.505
I agree.

12:18.538 --> 12:22.309
I'm not talking about the wife.

12:22.342 --> 12:24.544
70-year-old mothers of dead
marines have nothing to lose.

12:24.577 --> 12:27.180
Jesus, Donny's mom
isn't gonna be a problem.

12:27.214 --> 12:28.415
Don't personalize it, Isaac.

12:28.448 --> 12:30.250
She's not Donny's mom.

12:30.283 --> 12:31.318
She's a broken window.

12:31.351 --> 12:33.253
We're trying to avert a war.

12:33.286 --> 12:35.789
Get focused.

12:38.826 --> 12:41.161
Hugh...

12:41.194 --> 12:44.197
you really can't
expect me to do this.

12:44.231 --> 12:47.134
I served with her son, man.

12:48.101 --> 12:50.203
You served with Swagger too.

12:50.237 --> 12:52.840
If you don't wanna do it...

12:52.873 --> 12:54.908
let's get Payne.

12:54.942 --> 12:56.810
*

12:56.844 --> 12:59.179
He's handling something today.

12:59.212 --> 13:00.313
Great.

13:00.347 --> 13:02.382
That leaves you.

13:03.951 --> 13:05.485
ISAAC: All right, listen up.

13:05.518 --> 13:08.221
Intel has confirmed
that Mullah Abdul,

13:08.255 --> 13:11.091
commander of all Taliban forces
in Helmand Province,

13:11.124 --> 13:13.493
is holed up
in the village of Musa Qala.

13:13.526 --> 13:14.527
[tense music]

13:14.561 --> 13:15.929
Here's his latest video,

13:15.963 --> 13:17.564
uploaded about a week ago.

13:17.597 --> 13:20.834
MULLAH ABDUL:
[speaking native language]

13:30.477 --> 13:33.246
ISAAC: He beheaded
several doctors from the U.N.,

13:33.280 --> 13:35.182
two of which were American.

13:35.215 --> 13:36.850
0600 tomorrow morning,

13:36.884 --> 13:39.119
first and second squads
will surround the village.

13:39.152 --> 13:41.254
Once it's locked down,
I'll go in with Captain Rahim

13:41.288 --> 13:42.589
to talk to the village elders,

13:42.622 --> 13:44.557
see if they'll hand over Abdul
without a fight.

13:44.591 --> 13:46.393
You think there's any chance
of that happening?

13:46.426 --> 13:49.496
Musa Qala is a friendly village
with good people.

13:49.529 --> 13:51.631
They only shelter the Taliban
if they are forced to.

13:51.664 --> 13:53.200
Exactly.
That's why we're not

13:53.233 --> 13:55.135
just going in kicking in doors.

13:55.168 --> 13:56.436
Hearts and minds, men.

13:56.469 --> 13:58.438
Right, two to the chest,
one to the head.

13:58.471 --> 13:59.506
Got it.
[laughter]

13:59.539 --> 14:00.640
Hey, lock it down.

14:00.673 --> 14:02.375
Swagger,
before you say another word,

14:02.409 --> 14:03.610
you and Fenn
will insert tonight

14:03.643 --> 14:04.912
under the cover of darkness

14:04.945 --> 14:06.279
at a place of your choosing.

14:06.313 --> 14:08.315
You watch over me and Rahim
when we go in.

14:08.348 --> 14:10.250
Any hostile action, you end it.

14:10.283 --> 14:11.885
Anybody try
to slip out of the village

14:11.919 --> 14:13.586
when I'm talking to the elders,
you stop 'em.

14:13.620 --> 14:15.422
Copy that.
We're gonna give 'em a chance

14:15.455 --> 14:16.957
to make this easy,
but if they don't take it,

14:16.990 --> 14:18.291
that's on them,

14:18.325 --> 14:19.993
and since we're going after
a HVT,

14:20.027 --> 14:23.296
we'll have intel and assistance
from the CIA on this mission.

14:23.330 --> 14:25.632
Our liaison right here,
Mr. Meachum,

14:25.665 --> 14:27.634
anything to add.

14:27.667 --> 14:29.002
Nope.

14:29.036 --> 14:30.904
Just happy to be here.

14:37.044 --> 14:37.210
.

14:37.244 --> 14:37.377
Hey,

14:38.711 --> 14:40.113
something I can help you with,
Mr. Meachum?

14:40.147 --> 14:41.548
Is Sergeant Swagger
under you command

14:41.581 --> 14:43.583
or is he sort of
a superstar free agent?

14:43.616 --> 14:45.552
Gunnery Sergeant Swagger
reports to me.

14:45.585 --> 14:47.187
Why?
I hear he ignored

14:47.220 --> 14:50.657
a direct order from you
during your last mission.

14:50.690 --> 14:52.993
I'm probably not the first
person to tell you this,

14:53.026 --> 14:54.127
being that you're CIA and all,

14:54.161 --> 14:55.628
but you're misinformed.

14:55.662 --> 14:57.264
Good, I was hoping so.

14:57.297 --> 14:59.566
Because you're gonna need
to keep a tight leash on him

14:59.599 --> 15:00.700
when it come to Mullah Abdul.

15:00.733 --> 15:03.203
[scoffs]
Don't worry about Swagger.

15:03.236 --> 15:04.671
If he gets the Mullah
in his scope,

15:04.704 --> 15:07.074
he's gonna drop him.

15:07.107 --> 15:11.011
There are times when information

15:11.044 --> 15:13.113
is more lethal than ammunition,

15:13.146 --> 15:14.714
and Mullah Abdul

15:14.747 --> 15:18.685
is a guy that knows things
that can help us win this war.

15:18.718 --> 15:20.988
I understand that.
Mm-hmm.

15:21.021 --> 15:23.556
So go talk to
whoever you need to talk to

15:23.590 --> 15:26.626
and have my orders changed
from kill to capture.

15:29.696 --> 15:31.698
[whispering]
I don't want him captured.

15:31.731 --> 15:33.333
Well, I'm confused.

15:33.366 --> 15:35.035
How are you gonna talk to him
if he's dead?

15:35.068 --> 15:37.337
Exactly.

15:37.370 --> 15:39.639
I don't have time for
the Company's bullshit today.

15:39.672 --> 15:43.243
Mullah Abdul has a treasure
trove of intel in his head.

15:43.276 --> 15:46.946
Intel that can save
a lot of marines.

15:48.348 --> 15:51.351
So you want me to bag him,
throw him in a van,

15:51.384 --> 15:53.720
but report that he's dead?

15:53.753 --> 15:57.024
Article 92:
Failure to obey orders.

15:57.057 --> 15:59.259
Article 96:
Release of prisoner

15:59.292 --> 16:01.028
without proper authority.

16:01.061 --> 16:03.196
109:
Falsifying official statements.

16:03.230 --> 16:04.631
Do I need to continue?

16:04.664 --> 16:07.267
I get that you spent
the last decade of your life

16:07.300 --> 16:09.169
having the code of conduct
pounded into your head,

16:09.202 --> 16:12.372
but it's not gonna help us
win this war,

16:12.405 --> 16:14.741
and I know you know that.

16:14.774 --> 16:16.443
Or you wouldn't have traded
pulling triggers

16:16.476 --> 16:18.178
to take a command position.

16:18.211 --> 16:20.113
Surprise, you read my file.
Of course I have,

16:20.147 --> 16:22.782
and it tells me that deep down,

16:22.815 --> 16:25.085
you wanna make a difference
over here.

16:25.118 --> 16:28.221
Now, I'm a thousand choices
from being a true believer,

16:28.255 --> 16:30.390
but I know--

16:30.423 --> 16:33.260
I know what it takes
to save American lives.

16:34.394 --> 16:36.163
I'm asking

16:36.196 --> 16:38.331
if you do.

16:38.365 --> 16:41.101
[soft dramatic music]

16:41.134 --> 16:42.769
*

16:42.802 --> 16:45.238
Ladies, quit your knitting.
There's been a change of plans.

16:45.272 --> 16:47.240
Swagger and Fenn,
I need you to get on top

16:47.274 --> 16:49.442
of this grain storage facility
outside the village.

16:49.476 --> 16:51.811
Neeman and Walker,
convoy security.

16:51.844 --> 16:53.380
Everything else,
including our objective,

16:53.413 --> 16:55.282
remains the same.

16:55.315 --> 16:56.449
You two should get going.

16:56.483 --> 16:59.419
The rest of us
move out at zero-six.

16:59.452 --> 17:02.755
*

17:02.789 --> 17:06.393
Bob Lee, this is the world's
shittiest sniper hide.

17:06.426 --> 17:08.261
Sticks out like a sore thumb,

17:08.295 --> 17:09.696
and the wall
around the compound

17:09.729 --> 17:11.364
blocks most of
our field of fire.

17:11.398 --> 17:13.133
[exhales]

17:13.166 --> 17:15.268
Tell me the last time
the Captain waltzed in

17:15.302 --> 17:17.670
and casually made a change
to a mission.

17:17.704 --> 17:19.806
If the freaking
weather forecast changes

17:19.839 --> 17:21.274
he wants a full briefing,

17:21.308 --> 17:23.343
and runs through
the mission plan three times.

17:23.376 --> 17:25.112
Why not tonight?

17:29.182 --> 17:30.250
[knocks on door]

17:30.283 --> 17:32.685
Got a minute?
What's up?

17:32.719 --> 17:35.788
I wanted to talk about
the changes to the mission.

17:35.822 --> 17:38.158
I didn't change the mission,
Gunny, just your role in it.

17:38.191 --> 17:40.860
I understand my orders,
I just don't understand

17:40.893 --> 17:42.262
the reason for the change.

17:42.295 --> 17:43.430
You don't have to understand,

17:43.463 --> 17:45.298
you just have to do it.

17:45.332 --> 17:47.234
You worried
about not being the hero?

17:47.267 --> 17:50.337
My only concern is
about protecting other marines,

17:50.370 --> 17:52.839
which in this case is you.

17:52.872 --> 17:55.108
You're not worried
about protecting your own life?

17:55.142 --> 17:56.743
As long as it supports
the mission.

17:58.211 --> 18:00.213
All right, if the mission is
to kill the Mullah,

18:00.247 --> 18:02.149
we can't do it from that spot.

18:02.182 --> 18:04.083
You're a sniper,
you should know that.

18:06.819 --> 18:08.455
You do know that.

18:08.488 --> 18:11.191
Is that why the CIA guy's here?

18:11.224 --> 18:12.325
Take him alive?

18:12.359 --> 18:15.128
What you're seeing right now,

18:15.162 --> 18:16.563
we call that the big picture.

18:16.596 --> 18:19.332
There are grave responsibilities
that come with it.

18:19.366 --> 18:22.802
One of which is knowing
how to keep your mouth shut.

18:22.835 --> 18:25.205
Am I clear?

18:26.473 --> 18:29.509
[car approaching]

18:32.445 --> 18:35.248
MRS. FENN: You sure I can't
fix you something to eat?

18:35.282 --> 18:37.850
Why didn't you call the cops
when Bob Lee showed up?

18:37.884 --> 18:41.421
Bob Lee was like a brother
to my Donny.

18:41.454 --> 18:43.223
He was a wanted fugitive.

18:43.256 --> 18:46.859
Whom I believe was innocent.

18:46.893 --> 18:49.196
Did you look at
the facts of what happened?

18:49.229 --> 18:51.531
Facts can be twisted,

18:51.564 --> 18:54.201
but you can't fake
the look in someone's eyes

18:54.234 --> 18:56.903
when they're telling the truth.

18:56.936 --> 18:58.805
Bob Lee swore somebody
set him up,

18:58.838 --> 19:00.273
and I believe him,

19:00.307 --> 19:03.276
now more than ever.

19:05.645 --> 19:08.815
I've been expecting a visit...

19:11.351 --> 19:13.953
And here you are.

19:13.986 --> 19:16.856
Alone.

19:16.889 --> 19:19.459
*

19:19.492 --> 19:21.261
It doesn't have to
be like this.

19:21.294 --> 19:24.464
Son, you made your decision
long before you came to my door.

19:24.497 --> 19:27.234
If it's not me,

19:27.267 --> 19:30.270
it'll be somebody else.

19:30.303 --> 19:33.840
I can't stop that.

19:33.873 --> 19:35.475
You can run.

19:35.508 --> 19:37.210
I'm too old to run.

19:37.244 --> 19:39.312
Please

19:39.346 --> 19:40.947
just go, go.

19:40.980 --> 19:43.216
I got nowhere to go.

19:43.250 --> 19:44.817
and my conscience

19:44.851 --> 19:48.388
won't let me keep the secret.

19:48.421 --> 19:50.523
My Donny would never
forgive me...

19:50.557 --> 19:52.292
[latex rustling]

19:52.325 --> 19:54.494
And he'll never
forgive you either.

19:54.527 --> 19:57.497
[suspenseful music]

19:57.530 --> 20:05.505

20:11.511 --> 20:12.545
Read the articles Bob Lee
Swagger left in his cabin.

20:13.980 --> 20:15.315
The Russians had
the most to gain

20:15.348 --> 20:16.749
from the Ukrainian president's
death.

20:16.783 --> 20:17.884
All right, so you think
they hired him?

20:17.917 --> 20:19.452
Hired him, duped him.

20:19.486 --> 20:21.488
Whatever they did,
the Russians hung him out to dry

20:21.521 --> 20:22.722
after the assassination.

20:22.755 --> 20:24.491
All right,
so if they betrayed him,

20:24.524 --> 20:25.858
why didn't he expose them?

20:25.892 --> 20:28.361
To keep his wife
and daughter safe.

20:28.395 --> 20:29.962
[exhales]

20:29.996 --> 20:31.364
What?

20:31.398 --> 20:33.966
No, no, nothing, I just...

20:34.000 --> 20:35.802
I like how you don't let go.

20:35.835 --> 20:37.804
It's--I'm--I'm the same way,

20:37.837 --> 20:41.341
and I-I think you've got some
really interesting ideas here,

20:41.374 --> 20:42.942
it's just,

20:42.975 --> 20:46.012
how do you put Dmitri Voydian
with Swagger?

20:46.045 --> 20:48.348
That's where you
fill in the blanks.

20:48.381 --> 20:50.917
Ah.

20:50.950 --> 20:53.986
What did Homeland want
with Voydian?

20:54.020 --> 20:55.888
And how did he
get out of your custody

20:55.922 --> 20:57.757
and end up dead in Crimea?

20:57.790 --> 20:58.958
Well, we picked him up

20:58.991 --> 21:01.528
so he could be extradited
back to Moscow.

21:03.330 --> 21:05.432
Was it about Graznyole?

21:05.465 --> 21:08.935
What--what's that?

21:08.968 --> 21:11.037
Dated a guy once in college,
used to give me

21:11.070 --> 21:12.939
the same damn look
every time I asked him

21:12.972 --> 21:15.942
if he was fooling around.

21:15.975 --> 21:19.512
Finally caught him in bed
with my roommate.

21:19.546 --> 21:21.047
Well, that guy was an idiot.

21:21.080 --> 21:23.916
[soft tense music]

21:23.950 --> 21:27.320
[clicks tongue]
Well, Isaac said you were good,

21:27.354 --> 21:29.789
but I'm afraid I'm gonna have
to end this conversation.

21:29.822 --> 21:32.925
Because you're not really
with Homeland, are you?

21:32.959 --> 21:36.963
You CIA guys never act normal
when you're hiding a secret.

21:39.432 --> 21:41.067
Look, I shouldn't even
be telling you this,

21:41.100 --> 21:43.002
but this whole Graznyole thing,

21:43.035 --> 21:44.637
it's not part of the puzzle
you're working on,

21:44.671 --> 21:45.938
so just...
[mouthing]

21:45.972 --> 21:47.407
Let it go.

21:47.440 --> 21:49.376
You can't possibly think
there's a chance

21:49.409 --> 21:50.543
I'm going to do that.

21:50.577 --> 21:53.413
[sighs]

21:53.446 --> 21:55.515
All right, fine.

21:55.548 --> 21:58.385
I'll see how fast I can bump up
your security clearance.

21:58.418 --> 22:01.354
When that happens,
we can discuss Graznyole

22:01.388 --> 22:04.023
outside of this office.

22:04.056 --> 22:07.960
Just do me a favor.

22:07.994 --> 22:11.931
Don't discuss this conversation
with anyone.

22:13.600 --> 22:15.868
WOMAN: Early this morning,
the FBI confirmed that

22:15.902 --> 22:18.571
DNA found inside
a burned-out sniper hide

22:18.605 --> 22:21.040
does indeed belong
to former marine,

22:21.073 --> 22:23.643
turned failed assassin,
Bob Lee Swagger.

22:23.676 --> 22:25.978
Yeah, we've been hearing
Swagger was mentally disturbed,

22:26.012 --> 22:27.980
but blowing yourself up...
Mary, let's turn this off.

22:28.014 --> 22:30.450
WOMAN: Certainly confirm--

22:30.483 --> 22:33.920
Honey, listen to me.

22:33.953 --> 22:35.622
Don't you pay any attention

22:35.655 --> 22:38.124
to what those people on TV
say about your dad.

22:38.157 --> 22:40.126
A lot of it is just lies.

22:40.159 --> 22:43.963
I know.
Daddy's not really dead.

22:43.996 --> 22:45.965
Hey, Mary,

22:45.998 --> 22:47.467
why don't you go to our room

22:47.500 --> 22:49.001
and I'll meet you there
in a second, okay?

22:49.035 --> 22:52.071
Here, you can go play
that game you love.

22:58.545 --> 23:00.980
You've gotta talk to her.

23:01.013 --> 23:04.884
Kids just process death
differently than us.

23:04.917 --> 23:06.586
You know, I was reading
some stuff online,

23:06.619 --> 23:08.488
it's not uncommon
for them to be in denial.

23:08.521 --> 23:09.956
Julie, honey, I don't care what
you have read on the Internet.

23:09.989 --> 23:12.191
This--this isn't right.

23:12.224 --> 23:14.594
She thinks her dad is alive.

23:17.630 --> 23:19.932
He is.

23:21.968 --> 23:24.036
He's alive.

23:24.070 --> 23:25.204
What?

23:25.237 --> 23:27.139
Yeah, Bob--Bob Lee
faked his death.

23:27.173 --> 23:29.709
He had to to get the cops
and the feds off his back.

23:29.742 --> 23:32.645
Julie, I-I can't imagine how--

23:32.679 --> 23:36.148
how difficult this has been
for you,

23:36.182 --> 23:39.486
but they found his DNA
on his metal hip.

23:39.519 --> 23:41.120
Yes, it was planted there.

23:41.153 --> 23:42.555
Oh, my God.
Julie do--

23:42.589 --> 23:43.923
do yo--do you hear yourself?

23:43.956 --> 23:46.158
I know how it sounds.
Okay?

23:46.192 --> 23:47.527
But you've been
going through hell

23:47.560 --> 23:48.661
to help me and Mary.

23:48.695 --> 23:49.662
You deserve to know this.

23:49.696 --> 23:51.097
You're my sister.

23:51.130 --> 23:52.599
And what about Jim?

23:52.632 --> 23:54.066
No.

23:54.100 --> 23:55.602
Julie--
No, no.

23:55.635 --> 23:58.538
Look, I'm not--I'm not crazy.
Okay?

23:58.571 --> 24:00.540
I mean, I-I married a marine.

24:00.573 --> 24:02.542
It's not like I've--I've never
thought about his death.

24:02.575 --> 24:03.543
If he was dead,
I'd be dealing with it.

24:03.576 --> 24:04.977
Oh, my God.
[laughs]

24:05.011 --> 24:08.147
You have to trust me.

24:08.180 --> 24:11.017
You have to.

This is a shitty shot, Bob Lee.

24:36.709 --> 24:39.612
Yeah, the worst.

Sounds like bullshit straight
out of the CIA handbook.

31:33.392 --> 31:36.628
Look, if you want a seat

31:36.662 --> 31:39.398
at the--the big boy table,

31:39.431 --> 31:42.434
where the real decisions
are made,

31:42.468 --> 31:44.937
if you do,

31:44.971 --> 31:47.073
let me know.

31:47.106 --> 31:48.640
[tense music]

31:48.674 --> 31:51.243
You got real potential.

31:51.277 --> 31:53.145
Don't waste it.

31:53.179 --> 31:57.416
*

32:16.068 --> 32:18.004
[sighs]

32:20.739 --> 32:22.108
[footsteps approaching]

32:34.486 --> 32:37.389
Mm.
Hmm.

32:37.423 --> 32:39.258
Hi.
Hi.

32:40.492 --> 32:43.462
[speaking native language]

32:43.495 --> 32:45.231
Mm.

32:45.264 --> 32:48.300
[speaking foreign language]

32:49.335 --> 32:52.371
[speaking native language]

32:54.106 --> 32:56.042
Mm.

33:03.249 --> 33:05.051
[speaking native language]

33:05.084 --> 33:07.986
No, it's nothing.

33:09.121 --> 33:11.723
Let's eat.

33:11.757 --> 33:14.560
[mellow music]

33:14.593 --> 33:16.362
Oh, hey.

33:16.395 --> 33:19.431
Hi, uh, how are you?

33:19.465 --> 33:21.533
I, uh--I got you an Americano.

33:21.567 --> 33:23.435
I hope you like it strong.

33:23.469 --> 33:25.337
I take mine with two shots,
so...

33:25.371 --> 33:29.208
Yes, the stronger the better.

33:29.241 --> 33:31.277
Mm, all right.

33:31.310 --> 33:33.379
Read me in on Graznyole.

33:33.412 --> 33:35.214
All right.

33:35.247 --> 33:38.484
Now Dmitri Voydian was
running protection

33:38.517 --> 33:40.086
for a shady mining company

33:40.119 --> 33:42.821
that was operating
in a small Ukrainian village.

33:42.854 --> 33:46.492
Graznyole was what
the Russians call the place.

33:46.525 --> 33:49.328
Because that's what it was named
when Ukraine was part of Russia.

33:49.361 --> 33:51.130
Exactly.

33:51.163 --> 33:53.365
So the mining company
cut corners,

33:53.399 --> 33:56.302
uh, the water gets poisoned,
the mine collapses,

33:56.335 --> 33:58.770
pretty soon, hundreds
of villagers are dead.

33:58.804 --> 34:01.273
This is what Karlina Ordenko
was writing about.

34:01.307 --> 34:03.275
Voydian and his crew

34:03.309 --> 34:07.113
murdered dozens of people
to try to keep it quiet.

34:07.146 --> 34:08.414
Hence the charges against him

34:08.447 --> 34:11.483
and the reason
they wanted him back.

34:13.152 --> 34:15.254
So no link

34:15.287 --> 34:17.223
between this and Swagger

34:17.256 --> 34:19.258
or the assassination.

34:19.291 --> 34:21.527
Yeah, I'm afraid not...

34:21.560 --> 34:23.162
[exhales]
But, hey,

34:23.195 --> 34:25.331
why should that spoil
our afternoon?

34:25.364 --> 34:27.833
Wait, if the mine was
in Ukraine,

34:27.866 --> 34:30.269
then why do the Russians want
to prosecute Voydian?

34:30.302 --> 34:32.504
He didn't commit the crime
in their country.

34:32.538 --> 34:34.440
Well, Voydian was FSB.

34:34.473 --> 34:36.442
That's the equivalent
to the FBI.

34:36.475 --> 34:40.179
I mean, if you wiped out
a village in a foreign country,

34:40.212 --> 34:42.181
I'm pretty sure the U.S.
would take an interest.

34:42.214 --> 34:44.516
Not if was running
an illegal protection racket.

34:44.550 --> 34:47.486
In fact, they'd be
distancing themselves from me.

34:47.519 --> 34:50.489
[dramatic music]

34:50.522 --> 34:51.623
*

34:51.657 --> 34:53.525
[exhales]

34:53.559 --> 34:55.527
*

34:55.561 --> 34:58.230
How much of this is bullshit?

34:58.264 --> 34:59.898
[chuckles softly]

34:59.931 --> 35:01.567
You've gone to
an awful lot of trouble

35:01.600 --> 35:03.235
to try and throw me off track.

35:03.269 --> 35:05.337
I must be right
about a thing or two.

35:05.371 --> 35:10.309
*

35:10.342 --> 35:13.145
Do you really think
your colleagues at the FBI

35:13.179 --> 35:15.647
are gonna back you up?

35:15.681 --> 35:19.151
I mean, from what I've read,
you're prone to wild theories,

35:19.185 --> 35:21.320
you--you--you shot
and killed a hostage.

35:21.353 --> 35:23.255
*

35:23.289 --> 35:25.491
How many psych evals
did you have to take

35:25.524 --> 35:27.326
before they let you
go back to duty?

35:27.359 --> 35:28.527
I...

35:31.230 --> 35:34.266
Is this part of your
fallback plan, Agent Simms?

35:35.501 --> 35:37.869
[quietly]
You figured it out.

35:37.903 --> 35:41.340
Congratulations.

35:41.373 --> 35:42.908
Let me guess.

35:42.941 --> 35:44.376
You're gonna try and smear me
with my record,

35:44.410 --> 35:45.644
destroy my credibility?

35:45.677 --> 35:48.247
You really think
that's gonna work?

35:48.280 --> 35:49.615
But it won't come to that.

36:09.735 --> 36:11.503
JACK: [distorted voice]
Hey.

36:11.537 --> 36:14.373
I told you that coffee
was strong.

36:14.406 --> 36:15.374
*

36:15.407 --> 36:18.410
We better get you home.

36:18.444 --> 36:24.316
*

36:24.350 --> 36:27.386
[exhaling]

36:29.455 --> 36:31.290
Hey...

36:31.323 --> 36:33.759
she's awake.

36:33.792 --> 36:35.761
Now, before you drift back off,

36:35.794 --> 36:37.363
I think you'll be happy to know

36:37.396 --> 36:40.232
that the suicide note
that I typed up for you,

36:40.266 --> 36:41.667
very touching.

36:41.700 --> 36:43.569
You know, it says how
you couldn't live with the guilt

36:43.602 --> 36:45.637
of killing the hostage,

36:45.671 --> 36:48.407
and how it finally broke you.

36:48.440 --> 36:51.277
Blah, blah, blah.

36:51.310 --> 36:53.712
Now, the irony is,

36:53.745 --> 36:57.549
you don't even have the evidence
they're looking for.

36:57.583 --> 36:59.985
Now this alcohol...
[muffled speaking]

37:00.018 --> 37:03.289
That's gonna be injected
directly into your blood,

37:03.322 --> 37:06.625
oh, uh, along with the pills,

37:06.658 --> 37:09.261
will kill you
very pleasantly.

37:09.295 --> 37:10.262
You'll just, uh...

37:10.296 --> 37:12.631
[muffled yelping]

37:12.664 --> 37:14.032
You'll just fall asleep.

37:14.065 --> 37:15.434
[muffled groans]

37:15.467 --> 37:18.270
Now, doesn't that sound nice?

37:18.304 --> 37:19.505
[both grunt]

37:19.538 --> 37:20.739
Oh.

37:20.772 --> 37:23.742
[both grunting]

37:23.775 --> 37:26.745

Ah!

[grunts]

38:34.680 --> 38:37.416
[both breathing heavily]

38:44.390 --> 38:44.690
.

38:44.723 --> 38:46.792
That was Jack Payne.

38:48.126 --> 38:49.761
He told me his name was Simms,

38:49.795 --> 38:52.364
that he was CIA.

38:52.398 --> 38:55.133
Who am I supposed to go to
if the CIA wants to kill me?

38:55.166 --> 38:56.802
We don't know he's CIA.

38:56.835 --> 38:58.370
He could be a mercenary
working for anybody.

38:58.404 --> 39:01.072
Shit.

39:01.106 --> 39:03.709
They'll know you're alive now.
They're gonna come after you.

39:03.742 --> 39:05.977
Yeah, they'll take another shot
at you too.

39:06.011 --> 39:08.747
I can't exactly disappear
and go on the run like you.

39:08.780 --> 39:11.783
No, they'd find you,

39:11.817 --> 39:13.118
which is why I've been
watching out for you

39:13.151 --> 39:15.120
since I faked my death.

39:15.153 --> 39:17.389
I need you alive...
[exhales]

39:17.423 --> 39:20.025
as an asset
inside the government.

39:20.058 --> 39:21.727
An asset?

39:21.760 --> 39:25.664
How am I supposed to do that?

39:25.697 --> 39:28.767
Just go back to work tomorrow
and act like nothing happened.

39:28.800 --> 39:30.702
[exhales sharply]

39:32.771 --> 39:34.139
I let the world
believe you were dead

39:34.172 --> 39:37.008
and it almost got me killed.

39:37.042 --> 39:38.744
If you still want my help,

39:38.777 --> 39:41.813
don't let me
get blindsided again.

39:41.847 --> 39:44.115
So we partners?

39:44.149 --> 39:47.953
You're the most famous
dead assassin in history,

39:47.986 --> 39:51.923
and I'm a semi-disgraced
FBI agent.

39:51.957 --> 39:53.892
Not exactly Butch and Sundance.

39:53.925 --> 39:57.095
No, definitely not
Butch and Sundance.

39:57.128 --> 39:58.730
They both died in the end.

39:58.764 --> 39:59.965
[soft dramatic music]

39:59.998 --> 40:02.200
[grunts]

40:02.233 --> 40:04.503

40:04.536 --> 40:07.873
ISAAC: It's kind of nice
out here in the morning.

40:07.906 --> 40:09.841
before all the shit starts.

40:09.875 --> 40:12.511
BOB LEE: Yeah, it kinda is.

40:12.544 --> 40:15.447
*

40:15.481 --> 40:18.116
I'm not sorry
to see you standing here.

40:18.149 --> 40:20.719
I'm sorry for how it went down.

40:20.752 --> 40:22.854
What are you talking about?

40:22.888 --> 40:24.856
It was a successful op.

40:24.890 --> 40:26.892
I allowed Mullah Abdul
to ambush me

40:26.925 --> 40:29.561
so we could draw him out
and kill him.

40:29.595 --> 40:31.162
Mission accomplished.

40:33.164 --> 40:35.000
What about Captain Rahim?

40:35.033 --> 40:37.135
*

40:37.168 --> 40:40.539
Tragically killed protecting us.
[sighs]

40:42.040 --> 40:45.010
He'll receive a commendation
posthumously.

40:45.043 --> 40:47.045
He's a hero.

40:47.078 --> 40:49.014
It's all
in my after-action report.

40:49.047 --> 40:52.884
*

40:52.918 --> 40:54.886
It's not really like you
to protect yourself

40:54.920 --> 40:56.154
at the expense of the truth.

40:56.187 --> 40:58.957
I'm protecting the mission,
Bob Lee.

40:58.990 --> 41:00.526
The truth won't mean
a damn thing

41:00.559 --> 41:02.894
if we lose out here.

41:05.196 --> 41:08.500
I guess you're right,

41:08.534 --> 41:11.570
I couldn't do your job.
[exhales]

41:11.603 --> 41:13.539
Stick to being a sniper.

41:13.572 --> 41:16.908
[laughs]

41:16.942 --> 41:18.877
Well...

41:21.012 --> 41:22.548
It's probably safer that way.

41:22.581 --> 41:24.850
[chuckles]

41:24.883 --> 41:26.852
We good, marine?

41:26.885 --> 41:28.286
Yeah, we're good.

41:28.319 --> 41:31.189
Good.
