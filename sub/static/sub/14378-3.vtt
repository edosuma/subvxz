WEBVTT

00:04.016 --> 00:07.050
And U.S. department of education

00:45.150 --> 00:46.383
Bye, honey.

00:46.416 --> 00:47.300
Bye!

00:47.333 --> 00:49.483
Oh, take care
of yourself.

00:50.016 --> 00:51.350
Ok. Bye, mom.

00:51.383 --> 00:52.233
Bye, son.

00:52.266 --> 00:53.333
Good luck
in college.

00:53.366 --> 00:57.333
But, dear,
he's only a baby.

00:57.366 --> 01:00.416
Yeah, but he's
a smart baby.

01:00.450 --> 01:02.100
[Crying]

01:02.133 --> 01:06.100
Those aptitude tests
said Dexter is
Ivy league material.

01:06.133 --> 01:09.416
Now, you know
those tests don't lie.

01:11.333 --> 01:14.250
At last,
the university!

01:14.283 --> 01:16.383
I wonder what kind
of a brilliant mind

01:16.416 --> 01:20.400
will get paired with
my over-engorged brain?

01:20.433 --> 01:24.050
Ah, this is it.

01:25.350 --> 01:29.416
Hello,
genius roommate.

01:29.450 --> 01:33.366
Your new genius roommate
Dexter is here.

01:33.400 --> 01:35.333
Hey, genius
roommate dude.

01:35.366 --> 01:37.200
What's happening, man?

01:37.233 --> 01:40.366
Uh, genius roommate,

01:40.400 --> 01:44.133
is your name,
uh, Gabriel?

01:44.166 --> 01:46.000
Dude, I'm Gabe.

01:46.033 --> 01:47.033
Yeah!

01:47.066 --> 01:49.433
You're my new
roommate!

01:58.233 --> 02:01.033
Nice. Got yourself
some food.

02:01.066 --> 02:02.050
Very cool.

02:02.083 --> 02:03.283
So listen, young dude,
there's a little

02:03.316 --> 02:05.266
beginning-of-the-year
shindig tonight,

02:05.300 --> 02:08.083
and you, young dude,
are going.

02:08.116 --> 02:11.116
Parties, parties.
Always with the parties.

02:11.150 --> 02:13.183
Is that all
you're here for?

02:13.216 --> 02:14.366
No way, young dude.

02:14.400 --> 02:17.033
For your information,
I am deep in work

02:17.066 --> 02:19.300
on a top,
top secret project:

02:19.333 --> 02:22.216
The world's largest
didgeridoo.

02:22.250 --> 02:24.466
Digi-do-doo? Do what?

02:25.000 --> 02:26.383
Hey, man, you better
take it easy

02:26.416 --> 02:27.450
on the studies,
young dude,

02:27.483 --> 02:30.350
or you're gonna burn
yourself out, baby.

02:30.383 --> 02:33.133
Party now,
study later.

02:33.166 --> 02:35.200
Party now!
Study later!

02:35.233 --> 02:37.266
All: Party now!
Study later!

02:37.300 --> 02:40.033
Party now!
Study later!

02:41.400 --> 02:43.150
[Bell ringing]

02:43.183 --> 02:46.033
Dexter, voice-over: Though I am
surrounded by slackers,

02:46.066 --> 02:49.066
there will be no
cutting corners for me.

02:49.100 --> 02:51.150
While they party
their midnight away,

02:51.183 --> 02:54.133
I will be diving headfirst
into the knowledge.

02:54.166 --> 02:55.216
My roommate Gabe,

02:55.250 --> 02:58.333
perhaps the prince
of slackers,

02:58.366 --> 03:00.283
warns me of burning out.

03:00.316 --> 03:02.416
But for a mind
as bright as mine,

03:02.450 --> 03:07.383
that is simply
impossible.

03:09.400 --> 03:12.466
Now to get started
on my reading.

03:13.000 --> 03:15.333
[Crickets chirping]

03:18.100 --> 03:19.433
Man: Party!

03:19.466 --> 03:21.183
[People shouting]

03:21.216 --> 03:24.066
[Loud music playing]

03:26.350 --> 03:30.316
There's got to be
a quieter place to study.

03:32.216 --> 03:34.150
[Beeping]

03:34.183 --> 03:35.000
Ha!

03:35.033 --> 03:36.333
Eat my dust,
toad.

03:36.366 --> 03:39.050
Oh, yeah? Here comes
the leader shell.

03:39.083 --> 03:42.016
Here's lightning
for both of you.

03:42.050 --> 03:44.383
[Laughing]

03:44.416 --> 03:48.166
Hey, nerds,
shut up!

03:52.483 --> 03:54.333
2, 3, 4.

03:56.200 --> 03:58.250
Good acoustics in here.

04:03.133 --> 04:06.166
[Loud music playing]

04:08.050 --> 04:11.166
[People cheering]

04:11.200 --> 04:12.233
Aah!

04:12.266 --> 04:13.450
Hey, Dex,
care to join

04:13.483 --> 04:15.366
your buddy here
for a dip?

04:15.400 --> 04:18.083
[Laughing nervously]

04:18.116 --> 04:19.283
No, thank you.

04:19.316 --> 04:22.166
[Soft music playing]

04:23.266 --> 04:26.166
Oh, Mr. Resident advisor.

04:26.200 --> 04:27.150
What?

04:27.183 --> 04:29.416
Excuse me,
Mr. Resident advisor,

04:29.450 --> 04:32.400
but I must report
a disturbance.

04:32.433 --> 04:34.233
You, get in here.

04:34.266 --> 04:36.166
Hey, look who came
to party.

04:36.200 --> 04:38.400
Young dude? Hey!

04:38.433 --> 04:40.183
Gabe, what are you--

04:40.216 --> 04:43.166
ok, turn the music
back up. Way up!

04:43.200 --> 04:45.466
You're just in time,
young dude.

04:46.000 --> 04:46.350
For what?

04:46.383 --> 04:48.166
For my newest invention.

04:48.200 --> 04:50.383
In all my 32 years
of being a student here,

04:50.416 --> 04:52.283
this is my greatest
achievement yet.

04:52.316 --> 04:57.166
I give you
the ultimate
party hot tub!

04:57.200 --> 04:58.433
Ha ha!

04:58.466 --> 04:59.366
All: Wow!

04:59.400 --> 05:02.366
Gabe: Turn on
the jets, man.

05:14.200 --> 05:18.183
Dexter, voice-over:
Study, study.

05:18.216 --> 05:20.400
Study.

05:20.433 --> 05:22.100
Study...

05:22.133 --> 05:23.116
Gabe, voice-over:
Hey, man,

05:23.150 --> 05:24.416
you better take it
easy on the studies.

05:24.450 --> 05:27.066
Dexter, voice-over:
Study, study.

05:27.100 --> 05:29.016
Study, study, study.

05:29.050 --> 05:31.466
[Rising in volume]
Study, study, study!

05:32.000 --> 05:33.266
Study, study, study!

05:33.300 --> 05:34.483
Study! Study! Study!

05:35.016 --> 05:37.216
Gabe, voice-over:
You're gonna burn
yourself out, baby.

05:37.250 --> 05:40.133
Dexter, voice-over:
Study, study! Study! Study!

05:40.166 --> 05:41.183
Study!

05:41.216 --> 05:42.266
Study, study, study.

05:42.300 --> 05:45.033
Study! Study!
Study! Study! Study!

05:45.066 --> 05:47.266
Study!

05:47.300 --> 05:49.083
Shut up!

05:49.116 --> 05:50.133
Shut up!

05:50.166 --> 05:52.016
Aah!

05:52.050 --> 05:54.316
[Screaming]

05:57.050 --> 05:57.450
[Crash]

05:57.483 --> 06:00.433
Gabe, party now!

06:00.466 --> 06:04.000
No party now.
Final paper now.

06:04.033 --> 06:06.233
Last minute
all-nighter,
you dig?

06:06.266 --> 06:07.400
Party now!

06:07.433 --> 06:09.233
No, dude.
Not now.

06:09.266 --> 06:10.466
Party, party, party,
party, party!

06:11.000 --> 06:12.016
Young dude?

06:12.050 --> 06:13.416
Party!

06:13.450 --> 06:16.066
All: Shut up!

06:17.083 --> 06:18.400
Party!

06:18.433 --> 06:19.483
Get lost, kid.

06:20.016 --> 06:21.250
Party!

06:21.283 --> 06:23.066
Dude, time to study.

06:23.100 --> 06:26.033
Par--
shh.

06:27.366 --> 06:28.250
Have to party.

06:28.283 --> 06:30.350
Everybody has to party.

06:31.216 --> 06:32.483
Party now!

06:33.016 --> 06:35.316
All: Shut up!

06:36.466 --> 06:38.066
I'll show them.

06:38.100 --> 06:41.016
Dexter, boy genius,
knows how to party.

06:41.050 --> 06:44.416
[Whispering]
I'll need something...

06:44.450 --> 06:46.166
Big!

06:48.000 --> 06:51.333
Gabe, voice-over:
The world's largest
didgeridoo.

07:00.000 --> 07:01.266
Party now!

07:01.300 --> 07:04.216
Ha ha ha ha!

07:07.216 --> 07:08.200
Robots, go!

07:08.233 --> 07:10.416
Higher! Build it higher!

07:10.450 --> 07:13.000
Higher!

07:15.000 --> 07:18.350
With my new
flate-a-lab...

07:28.166 --> 07:33.400
I, Dexter,
will be the new party guru!

08:08.116 --> 08:09.216
What the heck?

08:09.250 --> 08:10.400
What's going on?

08:10.433 --> 08:12.066
It's so much bigger.

08:12.100 --> 08:13.150
Get out!

08:13.183 --> 08:17.183
Dexter: Ok, everybody,
are you ready to party?

08:17.216 --> 08:19.350
'Cause I know I am!

08:19.383 --> 08:20.350
And we're going to do it

08:20.383 --> 08:24.083
in the world's biggest
hot tub ever.

08:24.116 --> 08:26.416
But I got
an exam today.

08:26.450 --> 08:30.300
Study later!
Party now!

08:33.200 --> 08:34.216
[Sigh]

08:34.250 --> 08:35.466
Finally done.

08:36.000 --> 08:37.216
Must save.

08:37.250 --> 08:38.250
[Glass breaks]

08:38.283 --> 08:40.316
[Gurgling]

08:41.016 --> 08:43.300
[Screaming]

08:46.150 --> 08:49.316
Party, party, party.

08:49.350 --> 08:53.283
Party, party, party.

08:53.316 --> 08:55.233
Party, party...

08:55.266 --> 08:56.250
Party, party.

08:56.283 --> 08:59.100
Party, party,
party, party.

08:59.133 --> 09:02.066
Didn't you
learn anything
in college?

09:02.100 --> 09:03.166
Party now, study later.

09:03.200 --> 09:05.033
Party now, study later.

09:05.066 --> 09:06.050
Dad: Son, I'm afraid

09:06.083 --> 09:08.150
it's back to
grade school for you.

09:08.183 --> 09:11.366
You just couldn't
handle it, could you?

09:11.400 --> 09:13.400
Dexter: Party now!

09:29.433 --> 09:32.100
Dexter: Sweet success.

09:32.133 --> 09:34.216
The finishing touches
on my latest

09:34.250 --> 09:36.433
and greatest invention.

09:36.466 --> 09:39.316
I, Dexter,
will be the crown Jewel

09:39.350 --> 09:42.000
of the scientific
community.

09:42.033 --> 09:44.450
I, Dexter,
will be heralded

09:44.483 --> 09:48.216
as the greatest mind
of all time.

09:48.250 --> 09:53.466
I, Dexter,
will look really cool.

09:54.483 --> 09:58.383
And now, the testing.

10:03.333 --> 10:05.116
Whoa.

10:05.150 --> 10:09.133
I am going to be so rich.

10:09.166 --> 10:10.466
Pardon me, young man.

10:11.000 --> 10:13.050
I seem to have
dropped my teeth,

10:13.083 --> 10:16.283
and I need
a little help
reaching them.

10:16.316 --> 10:17.333
Dexter: Of course

10:17.366 --> 10:18.416
I will help.

10:18.450 --> 10:20.333
Here you go.

10:20.366 --> 10:22.483
Good gravy!

10:23.016 --> 10:25.350
Aah!

10:25.383 --> 10:28.400
What a strange
little man.

10:30.383 --> 10:31.383
[Panting]

10:31.416 --> 10:35.200
Must get back to the lab.

10:35.233 --> 10:37.283
Must--oof!

10:37.316 --> 10:39.100
Whoa, there,
young feller.

10:39.133 --> 10:41.066
You got to be
more careful.

10:41.100 --> 10:42.300
You know,
I once lost my wallet

10:42.333 --> 10:45.100
for two weeks
in this good stuff.

10:45.133 --> 10:48.050
Ho ho ho ho!

10:50.033 --> 10:54.050
Aah!

10:54.083 --> 10:56.283
Dad: Dexter!

10:57.266 --> 10:59.100
Uh, yes, father?

10:59.133 --> 11:02.066
Where are you going
so fast, boy?

11:02.100 --> 11:03.150
Come in here.

11:03.183 --> 11:06.066
There's something
I want to discuss with you.

11:10.300 --> 11:15.033
Dexter, have you seen
the remote control
anywhere?

11:15.066 --> 11:16.183
Uh, no, dad.

11:16.216 --> 11:17.433
Can I go now?

11:17.466 --> 11:19.166
Aah!

11:19.200 --> 11:22.000
I'll have to do it
the hard way.

11:22.033 --> 11:24.283
I'm going
to be sick.

11:24.316 --> 11:25.383
I know, it's horrible

11:25.416 --> 11:27.350
to have to do it
this way.

11:27.383 --> 11:29.000
Aah!

11:29.033 --> 11:31.266
Poor kid, I haven't
the heart to tell him

11:31.300 --> 11:34.400
that we used to
have to do it this way.

11:34.433 --> 11:37.400
Hey, dad!

11:37.433 --> 11:39.116
Dad: Yes, Dexter?

11:39.150 --> 11:41.100
Try your back pocket.

11:41.133 --> 11:43.183
Back pocket. Hey!

11:43.216 --> 11:44.450
But--

11:48.283 --> 11:50.166
mom: Oh, Dexter,
sweetie.

11:50.200 --> 11:51.416
Y-Yeah?

11:51.450 --> 11:52.400
[Gasps]

11:52.433 --> 11:54.316
Would you hand me
that light bulb

11:54.350 --> 11:56.366
there on the table?

11:58.133 --> 11:59.233
Here you go, ma.

11:59.266 --> 12:01.083
Thank you, sweetie.

12:01.116 --> 12:02.166
Don't mention it.

12:02.200 --> 12:05.266
Oh, did you find
the remote for your father?

12:05.300 --> 12:08.116
Uh, it found me.

12:12.116 --> 12:13.050
Figures.

12:13.083 --> 12:15.350
Hey, Dexter,
watch my new dance.

12:15.383 --> 12:18.000
Dee Dee, I do not
have time for--

12:18.033 --> 12:18.483
here I go.

12:19.016 --> 12:22.016
Oh, the horror.

12:22.050 --> 12:23.033
Ew. Ick.

12:23.066 --> 12:24.450
Blah.

12:24.483 --> 12:26.216
Ta-da!

12:26.250 --> 12:28.016
Yeah, yeah.
Now go.

12:28.050 --> 12:30.416
Dexter, you weren't
even watching.

12:30.450 --> 12:35.350
Believe me, I have seen
far too much already.

12:35.383 --> 12:37.066
[Panting]

12:37.100 --> 12:42.133
Science does not need
this kind of advancement.

13:07.183 --> 13:08.200
Dexter: Free energy.

13:08.233 --> 13:11.166
That would be
a scientific impossibility.

13:11.200 --> 13:14.300
But I, Dexter,
boy genius,

13:14.333 --> 13:17.300
am about to change that.

13:27.316 --> 13:30.316
Dexter: It's working.

13:32.400 --> 13:37.400
At last, free energy.

13:45.433 --> 13:47.166
I have failed.

13:47.200 --> 13:49.083
How could this happen?

13:49.116 --> 13:52.266
Oh, I have never failed before.

13:52.300 --> 13:55.083
Or have I and didn't know it?

13:55.116 --> 13:58.350
Am I not the boy genius
I thought I was?

13:58.383 --> 14:01.083
I am not cut out
to be a scientist.

14:01.116 --> 14:07.300
I am just an ordinary boy
from an ordinary family.

14:07.333 --> 14:09.083
Can life get any worse?

14:09.116 --> 14:10.083
Mom: Dexter,

14:10.116 --> 14:14.200
it's time to go
to grandpa's house.

14:14.233 --> 14:16.216
Yeah, mom.

14:16.250 --> 14:17.233
Hi, dad.

14:17.266 --> 14:19.450
I'll pick you up
later, sweetie.

14:19.483 --> 14:20.466
Yeah, mom.

14:21.000 --> 14:23.033
Hi, Billy.

14:23.066 --> 14:25.250
Hi, grandpa.

14:27.200 --> 14:28.200
Grandpa: How you doing,

14:32.066 --> 14:34.333
[Scraping]

14:39.466 --> 14:42.266
[Bones crack]

14:47.300 --> 14:49.166
Can I go home now?

14:49.200 --> 14:50.200
Sure you can,

14:50.233 --> 14:52.333
but then you'll never
know my secret.

14:52.366 --> 14:54.350
What secret?

14:54.383 --> 14:56.183
My secret laboratory.

14:56.216 --> 15:00.266
Secret laboratory?

15:00.300 --> 15:03.116
Yep.

15:06.233 --> 15:08.383
I've kept it
a secret

15:08.416 --> 15:11.216
since I was
about your age.

15:11.250 --> 15:12.366
[Door opens]

15:12.400 --> 15:15.466
But if you want
to go home...

15:16.000 --> 15:16.350
Go home?

15:16.383 --> 15:17.483
I'm not going anywhere

15:18.016 --> 15:20.300
until I see
your secret laboratory.

15:20.333 --> 15:23.416
Grandpa: Ok, ok.
Slow down. Slow down!

15:23.450 --> 15:28.483
Look out, secret stuff.
Here I come.

15:29.016 --> 15:32.066
Secret lab,
here we come.

15:32.100 --> 15:33.316
Look out.

15:33.350 --> 15:36.033
No stopping us now.

15:36.066 --> 15:37.383
Coming through.

15:37.416 --> 15:39.266

15:51.483 --> 15:54.416
Grandpa?

Grandpa?

15:56.116 --> 15:58.383
[Snoring]

16:01.283 --> 16:04.333
I guess I'll just have to find
the lab myself.

16:04.366 --> 16:09.050
If I were a secret lab,
where would I be?

16:09.083 --> 16:10.316
Bingo!

16:11.366 --> 16:14.100
One of these books
must be the switch

16:14.133 --> 16:17.016
to gain access
to the lab.

16:19.283 --> 16:21.000
Dexter: Aha!

16:21.033 --> 16:22.316
Ha.

16:35.266 --> 16:37.150
Hmm.

17:06.100 --> 17:08.416
Dexter, voice-over:
I have covered every
inch of this house

17:08.450 --> 17:12.166
and not a trace
of technology.

17:12.200 --> 17:14.050
What is this?

17:14.083 --> 17:16.466
Jackpot.

no, no, no, no.

17:38.416 --> 17:40.416
Dexter: Please, no.

17:41.316 --> 17:45.200
Grandpa.
Grandpa, are you ok?

17:46.350 --> 17:48.450
Grandpa?

17:48.483 --> 17:50.433
No!

17:50.466 --> 17:52.200
What?

17:53.383 --> 17:55.050
Huh?
Who's there?

17:55.083 --> 17:56.266
Grandpa?
Billy?

17:56.300 --> 17:57.233
I'm right here.

17:57.266 --> 17:58.450
Where are you,
Billy?
Here.

17:58.483 --> 18:04.083
If you can hear me,
just follow my voice.

18:04.116 --> 18:07.450
Hi. I just had
the craziest dream.

18:07.483 --> 18:11.166
I dreamt I was
a thigh exercise machine,

18:11.200 --> 18:14.433
and a giant set of thighs
closed around me--

18:14.466 --> 18:17.450
back and forth.
Back and forth.

18:17.483 --> 18:20.366
Back and forth.

18:21.350 --> 18:23.000
I confess.

18:23.033 --> 18:25.333
It was me.
I couldn't
help myself.

18:25.366 --> 18:30.066
I just really
wanted to see your
secret laboratory.

18:30.100 --> 18:31.016
And you will.

18:31.050 --> 18:32.083
I will?

18:32.116 --> 18:36.300
Uh-huh, right after
you clean up this mess.

18:40.066 --> 18:42.350
Dexter:
Sounds like the entire lab

18:42.383 --> 18:46.316
is emerging right
in front of me.

19:14.333 --> 19:19.400
And now to unveil
my greatest invention.

19:23.433 --> 19:26.050
They said
it couldn't be done,

19:26.083 --> 19:28.216
but here it is.

19:45.466 --> 19:47.050
Well, ha.

19:47.083 --> 19:48.183
What do you think?

19:48.216 --> 19:50.000
Mind-boggling, eh?

19:50.033 --> 19:52.250
Dexter, thinking:
This is no laboratory.

19:52.283 --> 19:53.416
It's just a garage,

19:53.450 --> 19:56.133
and he's just an old man,

19:56.166 --> 19:59.016
and I'm just a boy.

19:59.050 --> 20:00.183
I know.

20:00.216 --> 20:02.350
Oh, it gets me
the same way.

She's a real beaut,
ain't she?

20:07.050 --> 20:09.400
Yeah, grandpa.

the tricky part.

I'll bet you and grandpa
have a lot in common.

He's a genius, you know.

20:34.233 --> 20:35.433
Yeah, ma.

20:35.466 --> 20:39.116
You might say
he invented us.

20:40.083 --> 20:43.116
And now for the finale.

21:04.216 --> 21:05.266
Grandpa: Yippee!

21:09.450 --> 21:11.400
Hey, where'd he go?

21:11.433 --> 21:16.133
I guess he's not
interested in science.
