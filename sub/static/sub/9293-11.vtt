00:12.867 --> 00:15.300
As someone who has alienated
followers

00:15.367 --> 00:17.168
by choosing
the unpopular course,

00:17.233 --> 00:20.168
I suggest you tread carefully
among your people.

00:20.233 --> 00:22.134
 <i>They will come after you.</i>

00:22.200 --> 00:24.001
I need you to authorize
clearance for someone

00:24.068 --> 00:25.467
to get inside
the bunker.

00:25.534 --> 00:27.967
Once he's inside,
he'll carry the ball.

00:28.034 --> 00:30.267
You mean, kill the President?

00:30.333 --> 00:31.701
REED:
 <i>We have a cover.</i>

00:31.767 --> 00:32.299
A cover? Who?

00:32.366 --> 00:33.834
Assad.

00:33.901 --> 00:35.367
Assad?

00:35.434 --> 00:37.600
You're trying to make it look
like he did this?

00:37.667 --> 00:39.400
This is Tom Lennox.
I need to speak

00:39.467 --> 00:41.333
to the ranking
Secret Service agent on site.

00:41.400 --> 00:43.734
(groans)

00:43.801 --> 00:45.867
Carson wondered
if you were playing us.

00:45.934 --> 00:47.434
He said that he didn't want

00:47.500 --> 00:49.068
to bring you into this,
but I defended you!

00:49.134 --> 00:51.634
Nothing justifies
the killing of a president.

00:51.701 --> 00:53.500
The delivery system software

00:53.567 --> 00:56.333
was programmed for
five high-priority targets.

00:56.400 --> 01:00.834
Because of your carelessness,
we are now down to three.

01:00.901 --> 01:03.367
More than enough for
our needs, Gredenko.

01:03.434 --> 01:05.233
I don't want to be exposed
like this

01:05.300 --> 01:06.333
any longer than necessary.

01:06.400 --> 01:07.667
Do you think the authorities

01:07.734 --> 01:08.734
know we're working with Fayed?

01:08.801 --> 01:11.068
If they don't, they will soon.

01:11.134 --> 01:12.634
Bill, it's Jack.

01:12.701 --> 01:14.634
I've got the correct address
for Gredenko's safe house.

01:14.701 --> 01:16.567
BUCHANAN:
 <i>Turner's team will be there</i>
 <i>any minute.</i>

01:18.934 --> 01:19.567
Clear!

01:19.634 --> 01:21.567
Clear!

01:21.634 --> 01:24.801
AGENT:
Mr. Buchanan, there's no sign
of Gredenko or anyone.

01:24.867 --> 01:27.101
(gasps)

01:27.168 --> 01:28.200
Now you talk.

01:28.267 --> 01:29.300
That was from Gredenko.

01:29.367 --> 01:30.333
You tipped him off.

01:30.400 --> 01:31.901
Now over half
my team is dead!

01:31.967 --> 01:33.400
It wasn't Gredenko
on the phone.

01:33.467 --> 01:35.734
Those aren't his men!

01:35.801 --> 01:37.200
Who sent them?!
Your father!

01:37.267 --> 01:40.034
 <i>He has my son!</i>

01:40.101 --> 01:41.467
Take a look out the window.

01:41.534 --> 01:42.767
The adjacent roof.

01:42.834 --> 01:44.001
JACK:
Dad, it's over!

01:44.068 --> 01:46.734
There is no empire to protect.

01:46.801 --> 01:48.667
There's no legacy left.

01:48.734 --> 01:49.801
I'm the one you want.

01:49.867 --> 01:50.801
You let Josh go,

01:50.867 --> 01:52.834
I will surrender.

01:55.001 --> 01:56.467
You could have had it all.

01:56.534 --> 01:57.701
What are you waiting for?

01:57.767 --> 01:59.168
Do it!

02:03.734 --> 02:04.801
Who am I talking to?

02:04.867 --> 02:06.500
It's Charles Logan, Jack.

02:06.567 --> 02:08.068
You must have exhausted

02:08.133 --> 02:10.068
all your options
to find Gredenko.

02:10.133 --> 02:11.101
Come and see me.

02:11.168 --> 02:12.400
And come alone.

02:24.801 --> 02:25.834
GREDENKO:
Go ahead.

02:25.901 --> 02:27.200
We're on our way
to the rendezvous.

02:27.267 --> 02:28.834
Good. We've arrived.

02:28.901 --> 02:30.934
Is the shipment there
from Nevada?

02:31.001 --> 02:32.767
No, they are behind schedule.

02:32.834 --> 02:34.634
But they'll be here
any moment.

02:34.701 --> 02:36.734
How soon can you deploy
once we arrive?

02:36.801 --> 02:40.101
It will take us two
hours to assemble
the delivery system

02:40.168 --> 02:42.001
and run diagnostics,

02:42.068 --> 02:45.467
another hour
to secure the payload.

02:45.534 --> 02:46.801
That's longer
than I'd hoped.

02:46.867 --> 02:49.600
Listen, we are working
with the best technology.

02:49.667 --> 02:51.233
It can't be rushed.

02:51.300 --> 02:54.134
Just remember,
without us you'd be delivering

02:54.200 --> 02:55.901
your payload in weeks

02:55.967 --> 02:58.068
instead of hours.

02:58.134 --> 02:59.701
I haven't forgotten.

02:59.767 --> 03:03.801
It seems necessary
to remind you now and then.

03:03.867 --> 03:07.168
(scoffs)
I'll be glad

03:07.233 --> 03:08.801
when we no longer
have to deal

03:08.867 --> 03:09.867
with these people.

03:09.934 --> 03:13.134
They are living
in the Dark Ages.

03:13.200 --> 03:15.867
And they act
like they own the world.

03:15.934 --> 03:18.233
I'd much rather
be fighting them.

03:18.300 --> 03:23.168
If we succeed today,
we'll never have to.

03:23.233 --> 03:27.200
The Arabs and the West,
they'll destroy each other.

03:31.367 --> 03:33.567
The Ambassador just
arrived, Mr. President.

03:33.634 --> 03:34.767
He's in the waiting area.

03:34.834 --> 03:36.267
Good.

03:36.333 --> 03:37.967
Will Tom Lennox
be joining us?

03:38.034 --> 03:39.867
I spoke
to Reed Pollock.

03:39.934 --> 03:43.333
He says Mr. Lennox
is briefing the Speaker
and Minority Leader.

03:43.400 --> 03:44.333
When Tom's finished,

03:44.400 --> 03:45.967
tell him I want
to see him, please.

03:46.034 --> 03:47.001
Yes, sir.

03:47.068 --> 03:49.834
Mr. Ambassador.

03:49.901 --> 03:51.400
It's good to see you
again, sir.

03:51.467 --> 03:55.534
Mr. President, first allow me
to express my country's shock

03:55.600 --> 03:56.667
and deep regret

03:56.734 --> 03:58.701
over the devastating
attack in California.

03:58.767 --> 03:59.734
Thank you, sir.

03:59.801 --> 04:02.134
Of course.

04:02.200 --> 04:04.967
Any assistance
you may require,
you need only ask.

04:05.034 --> 04:06.134
I'm asking you now, sir.

04:06.200 --> 04:08.101
That's why you're here.

04:08.168 --> 04:11.134
I believe you know
Hamri Al-Assad.

04:11.200 --> 04:13.734
Mr. Ambassador.

04:13.801 --> 04:17.034
I have never met Mr. Assad
in person,

04:17.101 --> 04:18.966
but I know him
by reputation.

04:19.034 --> 04:21.534
His organization
has carried out repeated

04:21.600 --> 04:23.367
terrorist actions
against my country.

04:23.434 --> 04:24.367
Your own policies

04:24.434 --> 04:25.967
precipitated those actions.

04:26.034 --> 04:29.267
That's your justification
for killing innocent people?

04:29.333 --> 04:31.500
You and I define innocent
in different ways.

04:31.567 --> 04:34.333
My own deputy lost
his seven-year-old son

04:34.400 --> 04:35.534
in one of your bombings.

04:35.600 --> 04:36.801
That is how I define innocent.

04:36.867 --> 04:40.101
We are not here
to air past differences.

04:40.168 --> 04:42.134
Then why are we here,
Mr. President?

04:42.200 --> 04:43.500
At our last meeting,

04:43.567 --> 04:45.300
I informed you that we were in
contact with Assad.

04:45.367 --> 04:47.534
You told me it was
a positive step
toward peace.

04:47.600 --> 04:49.001
And I meant it
at that time,

04:49.068 --> 04:51.367
but I must confess,
after the last attack,

04:51.434 --> 04:55.434
I didn't expect to see you
in the same room with him.

04:55.500 --> 04:57.400
And I'm not so sure
I care

04:57.467 --> 04:58.767
to remain here either.

04:58.834 --> 05:01.767
It is no more pleasant for me,

05:01.834 --> 05:02.801
Your Excellency.

05:02.867 --> 05:04.300
Would you give us a moment?

05:04.367 --> 05:06.200
Certainly.

05:09.534 --> 05:11.767
Assad is here because
of the attack.

05:11.834 --> 05:13.500
To be frank, sir,

05:13.567 --> 05:15.467
we have three more nuclear
weapons loose in my country

05:15.534 --> 05:16.534
in the hands of terrorists.

05:16.600 --> 05:18.567
We didn't know that.

05:18.634 --> 05:19.767
In less than one hour

05:19.834 --> 05:21.767
Assad is going
to go on national television

05:21.834 --> 05:22.967
and issue a statement.

05:23.034 --> 05:24.867
It will be a global
appeal to extremists.

05:24.934 --> 05:27.901
Now, he's going to urge
them to put down their arms

05:27.967 --> 05:29.534
and engage
in peaceful
negotiation

05:29.600 --> 05:31.200
with the West.

05:33.567 --> 05:37.267
Now, we are hoping to compel
someone to come forward

05:37.333 --> 05:39.367
with any information
regarding those nuclear weapons.

05:39.434 --> 05:42.233
A petition like this
coming from Assad?

05:42.300 --> 05:43.634
It could have a
profound effect.

05:43.701 --> 05:44.901
We're counting on that.

05:44.967 --> 05:46.801
What do you need from us?

05:46.867 --> 05:48.734
I want a public statement
of support

05:48.801 --> 05:50.701
from your Prime Minister.
And I want it to follow

05:50.767 --> 05:52.300
right on the heels of Assad's.

05:52.367 --> 05:55.500
Mr. Assad is a polarizing
figure in my country.

05:55.567 --> 05:57.701
A public endorsement
of him could have

05:57.767 --> 06:00.400
grave political consequences
for the Prime Minister.

06:02.600 --> 06:04.534
Then you tell
your Prime Minister

06:04.600 --> 06:06.701
that we have
a carrier group
operating less

06:06.767 --> 06:09.233
than 25 miles off his shores.

06:09.300 --> 06:11.034
My advisors
are pressing me

06:11.101 --> 06:14.034
hard for a military response,

06:14.101 --> 06:15.734
so if we are attacked again,

06:15.801 --> 06:19.068
I won't be able
to hold them off.

06:19.134 --> 06:21.434
This is sounding like an
ultimatum, Mr. President.

06:21.500 --> 06:23.001
It's not an ultimatum,
Mr. Ambassador.

06:23.068 --> 06:26.834
I'm merely pointing out the fact
that neither the Prime Minister

06:26.901 --> 06:29.333
nor I have the luxury

06:29.400 --> 06:31.168
of worrying
about political consequences

06:31.233 --> 06:32.367
on a day like today.

06:32.434 --> 06:34.434
I am putting
my presidency
on the line,

06:34.500 --> 06:38.434
so please, stop
handing me excuses.

06:38.500 --> 06:39.734
Get on the phone

06:39.801 --> 06:42.333
and make this happen.

06:45.801 --> 06:47.400
Nadia, what's the status?

06:47.467 --> 06:50.934
Turner's team just completed
their second sweep of the house.

06:51.001 --> 06:52.634
But the results
were negative.

06:52.701 --> 06:54.267
If Gredenko was using
this address,

06:54.333 --> 06:57.233
he did a really good job
cleaning up after he left.

06:57.300 --> 06:58.667
There was one
operating land line.

06:58.734 --> 07:00.534
Morris is checking on
the router to see if there's

07:00.600 --> 07:01.534
any recent activity.

07:01.600 --> 07:02.467
Morris?

07:02.534 --> 07:04.400
Morris?!
Yes.

07:04.467 --> 07:05.367
Any luck on
the land line?

07:05.434 --> 07:07.534
No. I mean, not yet.

07:07.600 --> 07:08.801
They must have used

07:08.867 --> 07:10.367
an inverter
to stack their calls

07:10.434 --> 07:12.767
'cause I can't get
any records out.

07:12.834 --> 07:13.934
MARCY:
Mr. Buchanan,

07:14.001 --> 07:15.333
Jack Bauer's on the line.

07:18.734 --> 07:19.967
Go ahead, Jack.

07:20.034 --> 07:22.400
Bill, I'm near the airport
across the street

07:22.467 --> 07:23.534
from the Grandmont Hotel.

07:23.600 --> 07:25.300
I know. What's going on?

07:25.367 --> 07:26.901
It's complicated.

07:26.967 --> 07:28.168
Are the units dispatched?

07:28.233 --> 07:29.934
We have two units
on the way to the Grandmont.

07:30.001 --> 07:30.901
I'll have them meet you.

07:30.967 --> 07:33.034
Okay, I want you
to contact LAPD.

07:33.101 --> 07:35.767
Have them set up a five-block
perimeter around the hotel.

07:35.834 --> 07:38.101
They need to locate my father
and take him into custody.

07:38.168 --> 07:38.967
Your father?

07:39.034 --> 07:40.233
He's involved in this.

07:40.300 --> 07:41.901
I'll debrief you as soon
as we've got time.

07:41.967 --> 07:43.834
Were you able to pick up
anything on Gredenko?

07:43.901 --> 07:45.001
No.

07:45.068 --> 07:46.634
The Glasgow Street house
was deserted.

07:46.701 --> 07:48.834
We're processing it for clues,
but so far we've come up empty.

07:48.901 --> 07:50.667
We can't be sure Gredenko
was even there.

07:50.734 --> 07:52.168
I think I might
have a lead.

07:52.233 --> 07:53.168
What is it?

07:53.233 --> 07:54.500
Charles Logan.

07:54.567 --> 07:55.934
Logan?

07:56.001 --> 07:57.001
I spoke to him.

07:57.068 --> 07:58.300
He says he has
information on Gredenko.

07:58.367 --> 08:00.134
How the hell did you trace
this to Logan?

08:00.200 --> 08:01.134
Through my father.

08:01.200 --> 08:02.333
Bill, I need you

08:02.400 --> 08:04.134
to get me a helicopter
that can take me to him.

08:04.200 --> 08:05.534
He's at his retreat
in Hidden Valley.

08:05.600 --> 08:06.634
He's under house arrest.

08:06.701 --> 08:07.834
House arrest?
How was that possible?

08:07.901 --> 08:09.667
He was involved in the murder
of David Palmer.

08:09.734 --> 08:11.367
He brokered a closed-door deal.

08:11.434 --> 08:13.200
He plead guilty
to obstruction of justice.

08:13.267 --> 08:14.567
The public never

08:14.634 --> 08:16.534
even knew of his
involvement in
aiding terrorists

08:16.600 --> 08:18.134
or David Palmer's
assassination.

08:18.200 --> 08:21.333
Give me that helicopter.

08:21.400 --> 08:22.934
We have one in the area.
Shouldn't take more

08:23.001 --> 08:24.534
than a couple of minutes
to have it rerouted

08:24.600 --> 08:25.534
to your location.

08:25.600 --> 08:26.567
Thank you.

08:26.634 --> 08:28.867
Marilyn.
Jack.

08:28.934 --> 08:30.367
What happened?

08:30.434 --> 08:31.367
My father escaped.

08:31.434 --> 08:32.667
I don't know where he is.

08:32.734 --> 08:33.933
He might be
in the area.

08:34.001 --> 08:35.500
I want you both
to go back to CTU.

08:35.567 --> 08:37.400
Josh, I know
that there's a lot
to explain,

08:37.467 --> 08:38.801
and I promise you
when this is over,

08:38.866 --> 08:40.500
you and I are
going to sit down

08:40.567 --> 08:43.001
and I will talk you through
what happened.

08:43.068 --> 08:44.232
Okay.

08:44.300 --> 08:45.233
Let's go.

08:45.300 --> 08:46.367
You're not coming with us?

08:46.434 --> 08:48.500
No, Gredenko wasn't
at the house.

08:48.567 --> 08:50.068
I need to follow up
another lead.

08:50.134 --> 08:52.534
Take these people
back to CTU.

08:52.600 --> 08:55.168
Yes, sir.

08:55.267 --> 08:56.734
Josh, get in.

08:56.801 --> 08:58.400
Jack...

08:58.467 --> 09:00.534
thank you.

09:00.600 --> 09:02.834
Thank you
for saving my son.

09:02.901 --> 09:06.200
He reminds me of you.

09:09.134 --> 09:12.001
You can see it in his eyes.

09:14.267 --> 09:16.068
Marilyn, please,
you have to go.

09:16.134 --> 09:17.200
Okay.

09:35.801 --> 09:37.233
Gentlemen.

09:39.400 --> 09:40.467
Sign in, sirs.

09:51.034 --> 09:52.867
We'll need to process you
again,

09:52.934 --> 09:53.901
Mr. Carson.

09:53.967 --> 09:55.400
Of course.

09:59.934 --> 10:01.767
What's your occupation?

10:01.834 --> 10:03.834
I'm a policy analyst

10:03.901 --> 10:06.967
with the
Stanton Institute.

10:08.701 --> 10:10.134
State your business here.

10:10.200 --> 10:12.734
I'm here to consult on
civil defense procedures.

10:12.801 --> 10:14.233
At the request
of Tom Lennox.

10:18.001 --> 10:19.500
Test, one, two, three.

10:21.600 --> 10:23.801
(recording):
Test, one, two, three.

10:27.001 --> 10:28.500
Thank you, sirs.

10:28.567 --> 10:29.600
Thank you.

10:29.667 --> 10:31.834
Thank you.

10:34.934 --> 10:36.434
We've got a problem.

10:36.500 --> 10:38.801
Tom Lennox tried to warn
Secret Service about us.

10:38.867 --> 10:40.233
What?!

10:40.300 --> 10:42.701
I stopped him before he was able
to alert anyone.

10:42.767 --> 10:44.200
But I had
to restrain him.

10:44.267 --> 10:46.667
You said that Lennox
was on board with the plan.

10:46.734 --> 10:47.934
I thought
that he was.

10:48.001 --> 10:49.400
Either he's changed
his mind or you're

10:49.467 --> 10:52.634
right and he's been playing us
all along. Regardless,

10:52.701 --> 10:54.101
we're gonna have
to deal with it.

10:59.834 --> 11:02.434
Son of a bitch.

11:02.500 --> 11:04.734
We've got to move him.
I'm going to need this space.

11:04.801 --> 11:05.834
Get me some tape.

11:09.467 --> 11:11.734
Let's go, over here.

11:13.400 --> 11:15.734
Sit down,
hands behind your back.

11:28.600 --> 11:30.667
We're going to have
to take care of him.

11:30.734 --> 11:31.967
Make it look
like a suicide.

11:33.600 --> 11:34.867
No.

11:34.934 --> 11:37.567
No. Listen, eliminating
President Palmer

11:37.634 --> 11:39.734
is for the good of the country,
all right?

11:39.801 --> 11:41.567
It's the only way to get
him out of office.

11:41.634 --> 11:44.434
Killing Tom Lennox
only benefits us.

11:44.500 --> 11:45.567
We don't have any choice.
Listen.

11:45.634 --> 11:47.400
Tom Lennox is a very smart man.

11:47.467 --> 11:49.967
Now I think that once
Vice President Daniels

11:50.034 --> 11:52.500
is holding the reins, and
enacting the policies

11:52.567 --> 11:55.867
that Lennox himself created,
we can convince him

11:55.934 --> 11:57.333
to keep quiet.

11:57.400 --> 12:00.300
I'm not gambling my life on
Lennox's good judgment.

12:00.367 --> 12:01.734
Look, it's a risk,

12:01.801 --> 12:04.500
but it is a risk that
I'm willing to take.

12:04.567 --> 12:06.500
We're not cold-blooded
murderers.

12:06.567 --> 12:08.767
We're just trying
to save our country.

12:10.467 --> 12:12.901
Either way,
we do not have time
to resolve this now.

12:12.967 --> 12:15.534
Assad goes before the
cameras within an hour.

12:15.600 --> 12:17.101
You said it would
take 25 minutes

12:17.168 --> 12:18.600
for you to
assemble this?

12:18.667 --> 12:19.634
25 to 30.

12:19.701 --> 12:21.767
Then you better
get started now.

12:21.834 --> 12:23.767
If we're going to frame
Assad for the assassination,

12:23.834 --> 12:25.901
then this bomb has to explode
when they're both together.

12:56.867 --> 12:58.368
--Reed.

12:58.434 --> 13:00.368
Yes, Melinda.

13:00.434 --> 13:03.101
I'm still waiting
for the briefing stats
that Tom promised me.

13:03.167 --> 13:04.867
Well Tom just e-mailed
them to you.

13:04.934 --> 13:07.434
They should be on your
screen by the time
you're back at your desk.

13:07.500 --> 13:09.767
By the way, is Tom
in his office?

13:09.834 --> 13:13.267
Uh, no, no.

13:13.334 --> 13:15.234
Um, no, Tom is down
in Conference B.

13:15.301 --> 13:16.934
He's meeting with some
policy analysts from Langley.

13:17.001 --> 13:19.434
I just came from Conference B.

13:19.500 --> 13:21.401
Secret Service is
meeting in there.

13:21.468 --> 13:24.167
Well, they must have switched
to another room, then.

13:24.234 --> 13:26.234
Listen, I'll try to
track Tom down for you.

13:32.001 --> 13:33.834
(sighs)

13:37.401 --> 13:39.201
What is it, Morris?

13:39.267 --> 13:41.533
I have to uplink these traffic
vectors to the Homeland sub-net.

13:41.600 --> 13:44.234
I've been trying,
I've been trying

13:44.301 --> 13:45.700
and it just won't go through.

13:45.767 --> 13:46.800
Check your S.I.P. adapter.

13:46.867 --> 13:48.867
What about my S.I.P. adapter?

13:48.934 --> 13:50.834
You've specified the
wrong slot assignment.

13:52.368 --> 13:54.434
Oh, what an idiot.

13:54.500 --> 13:55.533
Thank you.

13:55.600 --> 13:56.567
That'll work.

13:58.734 --> 14:00.533
Did you call your sponsor?

14:00.600 --> 14:04.134
I'm getting tired of you
giving me the third degree.

14:04.201 --> 14:05.368
Yeah, well, I covered for you.

14:05.434 --> 14:06.900
I didn't tell anyone
you took a drink.

14:06.967 --> 14:09.134
I didn't take a drink--
I spat it out.

14:09.201 --> 14:10.600
I told you.

14:10.667 --> 14:12.167
You promised me you'd
call your sponsor.
And I did.

14:12.234 --> 14:13.401
Well?

14:13.468 --> 14:15.434
We had this
long talk.

14:15.500 --> 14:16.667
I feel a lot better,

14:16.734 --> 14:17.900
really.

14:17.967 --> 14:19.900
You're not acting like it.

14:19.967 --> 14:23.201
Why don't we install
a breathalyzer at
my work station?

14:23.267 --> 14:25.567
Will that satisfy you?
I just want to make
sure you're okay.

14:25.633 --> 14:26.934
I helped terrorists arm
a nuclear bomb today.

14:27.001 --> 14:28.934
I'm not going to be okay
for a long time.

14:29.001 --> 14:30.967
That doesn't mean to say
I can't do my job.

14:32.500 --> 14:33.900
Now if you'll
excuse me,

14:33.967 --> 14:35.401
I have to swap out
this server port.

14:50.633 --> 14:52.734
Where's Morris?

14:52.800 --> 14:54.533
He's swapping out
a server port.

14:54.600 --> 14:56.767
He's supposed to be checking on
Gredenko's landline.

14:56.834 --> 14:59.368
Well, he's juggling
a lot right now.

14:59.434 --> 15:00.900
Being short-handed,
we're all trying

15:00.967 --> 15:03.533
to pick up the slack.

15:05.834 --> 15:08.767
Now, I'm wondering
if it's more than that.

15:08.834 --> 15:10.867
What?

15:10.934 --> 15:11.900
Look, he's been tortured.

15:11.967 --> 15:12.900
He's under a lot
of stress.

15:12.967 --> 15:14.734
Maybe he should
be pulled.

15:14.800 --> 15:17.201
Yeah, he's a little
upset, but he's
still better than 90%

15:17.267 --> 15:18.900
of the tech people
we have around here.

15:18.967 --> 15:20.267
We need Morris
on the floor.

15:24.600 --> 15:26.301
All right, Chloe,

15:26.368 --> 15:27.533
but I'm keeping my eye on him.

15:27.600 --> 15:28.867
If I see anything else
I don't like,

15:28.934 --> 15:29.867
I go to Buchanan.

15:29.934 --> 15:31.267
Fine.

15:42.633 --> 15:43.934
( recording ):
Hi, this is Jeannie.

15:44.001 --> 15:45.934
I'm not here right now,
but please leave a message

15:46.001 --> 15:48.767
and the time of day you called
and I'll get back to you.

15:48.834 --> 15:50.267
Hi, Jeannie,
this is Chloe O'Brian.

15:50.334 --> 15:52.500
You don't know me,
but I'm Morris's ex-wife.

15:52.567 --> 15:54.633
Could you call me back
as soon as possible?

15:54.700 --> 15:56.101
It's important.

15:56.167 --> 15:59.267
I'm at (310) 597-3781.
Thank you.

15:59.334 --> 16:02.401
Nadia, Jack will be
arriving at Logan's
estate any moment.

16:02.468 --> 16:04.468
I want tac teams
on alert

16:04.533 --> 16:06.667
and prepped
for redeployment.
Yes, sir.

16:06.734 --> 16:08.201
We're out of leads.

16:08.267 --> 16:11.134
Let's hope Jack can get
something from Logan.

16:25.401 --> 16:27.334
Could we have a moment, please?

16:31.368 --> 16:33.900
Must have been hard
for you to find out
about your father's

16:33.967 --> 16:35.167
involvement
in all of this.

16:35.234 --> 16:38.767
I'm not here to talk
about my father.

16:38.834 --> 16:40.667
Dmitri Gredenko--
what do you know about him?

16:40.734 --> 16:42.900
I know Gredenko
supplied Fayed

16:42.967 --> 16:44.633
with five Russian
tactical nukes,

16:44.700 --> 16:46.334
one of which exploded
this morning in Valencia.

16:46.401 --> 16:47.934
One of which you managed
to disarm,

16:48.001 --> 16:49.867
so that leaves us three
we need to recover.

16:49.934 --> 16:51.234
That's correct.

16:51.301 --> 16:54.001
I get regular intelligence
updates.

16:54.067 --> 16:56.867
And I still have
my sources.

16:56.934 --> 17:00.567
So you need Gredenko
to find Fayed.

17:00.633 --> 17:02.834
Can you help us?

17:02.900 --> 17:04.334
Yes, I can.

17:04.401 --> 17:08.468
But you want some kind
of plea agreement.

17:08.532 --> 17:10.666
You're unbelievable.

17:10.733 --> 17:14.900
I don't blame you
for thinking that, Jack.

17:14.967 --> 17:17.166
But I want you to know
that I'm not the same man

17:17.233 --> 17:18.401
that I was
two years ago.

17:18.468 --> 17:20.767
Just as you're not
the same man

17:20.834 --> 17:23.267
who was dragged away
and thrown into
a Chinese prison.

17:23.334 --> 17:27.201
I've changed. I've had time
to think about what I did.

17:27.267 --> 17:30.767
I have reconnected
with my faith.

17:30.834 --> 17:32.567
So, no, I don't want a pardon.

17:32.633 --> 17:34.867
And I wouldn't accept it if it
was offered to me.

17:34.934 --> 17:36.867
What do you want?
Nothing.

17:36.934 --> 17:39.468
I want to give you the
information you need

17:39.533 --> 17:40.767
with no conditions.

17:40.834 --> 17:42.600
I'm listening.

17:42.667 --> 17:44.934
I never dealt with
Gredenko directly,

17:45.001 --> 17:46.934
but I know how
we can find him.

17:47.001 --> 17:48.900
How?
Through Anatoly Markov.

17:48.967 --> 17:51.867
He's the Russian Consul General,
here in Los Angeles.

17:51.934 --> 17:53.567
CTU contacted the Consul General

17:53.633 --> 17:55.700
as soon as we saw Gredenko's
name on the list.

17:55.767 --> 17:57.368
He denied any knowledge

17:57.434 --> 17:58.867
of his whereabouts.

17:58.934 --> 18:02.368
Markov's lying.

18:02.434 --> 18:04.468
He's been the liaison
for Gredenko for years.

18:04.533 --> 18:06.134
Liaison for what?

18:06.201 --> 18:08.334
For business concerns looking
to acquire

18:08.401 --> 18:09.867
the products that
Gredenko provides.

18:09.934 --> 18:12.633
No, don't.
Don't make the
wrong play, Jack.

18:14.334 --> 18:16.800
Now if you go down
official channels,

18:16.867 --> 18:18.401
you'll end up
in a hopeless maze.

18:18.468 --> 18:20.101
Markov has friends
in the highest levels

18:20.167 --> 18:21.800
of the Russian government.

18:21.867 --> 18:23.368
They can protect him
indefinitely.

18:23.434 --> 18:24.600
If you want to access

18:24.667 --> 18:26.734
what he knows
right now,

18:26.800 --> 18:27.934
you need to go through
back channels.

18:32.800 --> 18:34.267
What back channels?

18:34.334 --> 18:37.134
Me. I'm your best chance to get
the information you need

18:37.201 --> 18:39.434
in the time frame
you need it.
What are you proposing?

18:39.500 --> 18:41.633
That I speak
to Markov myself,
in person.

18:41.700 --> 18:43.401
Why would Markov
talk to you?

18:43.468 --> 18:45.334
Because I have leverage.

18:45.401 --> 18:46.700
Markov was involved
in the conspiracy

18:46.767 --> 18:48.401
that put me where I am today.

18:48.468 --> 18:50.867
I didn't give him up.

18:50.934 --> 18:53.134
But he knows I still can.

18:58.934 --> 19:00.867
I don't trust you.

19:22.601 --> 19:24.734
--Go ahead, Jack.

19:24.833 --> 19:27.501
Mr. President, thank you
for taking my call.

19:27.567 --> 19:28.634
You said it was urgent.

19:28.701 --> 19:30.833
I think we have a way
of finding Gredenko.

19:30.900 --> 19:32.000
It was my understanding

19:32.067 --> 19:33.134
that we lost Gredenko.

19:33.200 --> 19:35.200
Are you telling me
we have a new lead?

19:35.267 --> 19:37.601
Yes, sir.
Mr. President,

19:37.668 --> 19:40.833
the lead is Charles Logan.

19:40.900 --> 19:42.034
Logan?

19:42.100 --> 19:43.833
Yes, sir.
I'm with him now.

19:43.900 --> 19:46.334
He claims that his
administration had
dealings with Gredenko,

19:46.401 --> 19:49.867
and that he has a contact
that will lead us to him.
Who?

19:49.933 --> 19:52.867
AAnatolyotoly Markov-- the
Russian
Consul in Los Angeles.

19:52.933 --> 19:55.367
When we learned
about Gredenko, Jack,

19:55.434 --> 19:57.034
I placed a call
to the Consulate myself.

19:57.100 --> 19:58.800
Now that's a dead end.
Not according to Logan.

19:58.867 --> 20:01.634
He wants to meet with Markov
in the Consulate in person.

20:01.701 --> 20:03.000
He says that's the only way

20:03.067 --> 20:04.367
that we can get the information
we need.

20:04.434 --> 20:09.967
Jack... Logan is under
house arrest.

20:10.034 --> 20:12.067
That's why I'm calling you,
Mr. President.

20:12.134 --> 20:14.234
We need an executive order

20:14.301 --> 20:16.833
granting Logan
a temporary furlough.

20:16.900 --> 20:18.501
Do you realize what
you're asking me?

20:18.567 --> 20:21.167
Logan was behind the
assassination of my brother.

20:21.234 --> 20:22.701
Sir, I would not be calling

20:22.768 --> 20:24.434
if I didn't think
this was necessary.

20:24.501 --> 20:25.933
I don't trust
this man, Jack.

20:26.000 --> 20:28.601
This could be some maneuver on
his part to gain his freedom.

20:28.668 --> 20:31.301
I think we need
to take a chance on him,

20:31.367 --> 20:34.100
and I will enter
the Consulate with Logan

20:34.167 --> 20:35.867
as part of his
security detail.

20:35.933 --> 20:39.734
Besides that, I think
he's after something else.

20:39.800 --> 20:41.234
And what exactly
would that be?

20:41.301 --> 20:43.401
Redemption.

20:43.467 --> 20:45.401
Jack, I have no desire
to facilitate

20:45.467 --> 20:47.334
any kind of redemption
for Charles Logan.

20:47.401 --> 20:49.567
Mr. President, right now I think
he's the only way

20:49.634 --> 20:51.434
we're going to find Gredenko
and the bombs.

20:53.900 --> 20:54.967
Put him on.

20:58.900 --> 21:01.734
He wants to talk to you.

21:04.967 --> 21:06.800
Hello, Mr. President.

21:06.867 --> 21:09.067
I want to hear it
from <i>your</i> lips.

21:09.134 --> 21:11.067
Tell me why
I should agree to this.

21:11.134 --> 21:12.668
Because you need me,
Mr. President.

21:12.734 --> 21:13.933
It's as simple as that.

21:14.000 --> 21:15.800
I can speak
to the Russian Consul myself.

21:15.867 --> 21:17.200
Yes, sir, you could do that,

21:17.267 --> 21:19.567
but with all due respect,
you'd be wasting your time.

21:19.634 --> 21:22.067
I have a prior relationship
with Markov that...

21:22.134 --> 21:23.401
we can exploit.

21:23.467 --> 21:25.467
Again, with due respect, sir,

21:25.534 --> 21:28.601
I have more experience
dealing with people
of Markov's character.

21:28.668 --> 21:30.800
You mean criminals
like yourself?

21:31.867 --> 21:33.467
I know how he thinks,

21:33.534 --> 21:36.800
and that's an advantage
you can't afford to ignore.

21:36.867 --> 21:40.668
I want you to know that
if this is some kind of
move to escape custody,

21:40.734 --> 21:42.034
I <i>will</i> commit
the resources

21:42.100 --> 21:44.034
of my administration
to hunt you down.

21:44.100 --> 21:45.867
I can assure you,
Mr. President,

21:45.933 --> 21:48.267
I have nothing
like that in mind.

21:48.334 --> 21:50.668
Several years ago,
I was in the same situation,

21:50.734 --> 21:54.501
and I... reached out
to your brother for counsel.

21:54.567 --> 21:57.833
David helped me successfully
navigate that crisis.

21:57.900 --> 22:01.434
Yes. He did.

22:01.501 --> 22:05.567
And you repaid him
by killing him.

22:05.634 --> 22:09.000
I would like to do for you
what your brother did for me.

22:09.067 --> 22:11.501
I would like to help you
get through this.

22:13.534 --> 22:15.634
Don't make the mistake
of assuming

22:15.701 --> 22:18.434
this represents any kind
of forgiveness on my part.

22:18.501 --> 22:19.800
I understand that,
Mr. President,

22:19.867 --> 22:22.534
but I hope over time
to earn your forgiveness.

22:22.601 --> 22:24.301
Put Jack on the phone.

22:29.267 --> 22:31.668
Yes, Mr. President?

22:31.734 --> 22:33.034
I'm granting the furlough.

22:35.367 --> 22:37.501
Just make it count, Jack.

22:37.567 --> 22:38.867
I'll do my best.

22:38.933 --> 22:41.701
Thank you, Mr. President.

22:41.768 --> 22:44.701
This isn't easy for
you, is it, Jack?

22:44.768 --> 22:46.501
What?

22:46.567 --> 22:48.534
The possibility I may not be

22:48.601 --> 22:51.067
the same man
you've hated for so long.

23:08.067 --> 23:09.867
You're late.

23:09.933 --> 23:12.167
Did you have any trouble?

23:12.234 --> 23:14.534
We had to bypass a vehicle
inspection in Riverside.

23:14.601 --> 23:15.734
Other than that,

23:15.800 --> 23:18.200
we had a smooth trip.
Good. Let's have a look.

23:19.134 --> 23:21.100
Open up.

23:30.867 --> 23:32.567
The U.S. military

23:32.634 --> 23:35.701
has spent millions
to develop this drone.

23:35.768 --> 23:39.334
Today American taxpayers

23:39.401 --> 23:41.833
will get a demonstration of...

23:41.900 --> 23:43.501
what their money

23:43.567 --> 23:46.501
has produced.

23:46.567 --> 23:48.467
According to Charles
Logan, Anatoly Markov,

23:48.534 --> 23:51.000
the head of the Russian
Consulate in Los Angeles,

23:51.067 --> 23:52.567
has information on Gredenko.

23:52.634 --> 23:55.601
Logan and Bauer
are going to see Markov now.

23:55.668 --> 23:58.900
I want comm locked

23:58.967 --> 24:00.501
on any communication outside

24:00.567 --> 24:02.434
and possibly inside
the Consulate.

24:02.501 --> 24:03.734
Morris,

24:03.800 --> 24:06.034
are you still the lead
on decoding diplomatic

24:06.100 --> 24:08.601
communication
leaving the Consulate?
Yes.

24:08.668 --> 24:10.933
I want you to hand that over
to Chloe.

24:11.000 --> 24:12.434
Why?

24:12.501 --> 24:14.434
Because of what you've
been through today.

24:14.501 --> 24:16.334
I'm not sure
you can handle it,

24:16.401 --> 24:18.434
and we can't afford
any mistakes.

24:18.501 --> 24:20.234
Look, I'm perf...
Chloe, I want you

24:20.301 --> 24:21.768
to take over Morris's
workload on the Consulate.

24:21.833 --> 24:22.833
Hold on a second.

24:22.900 --> 24:24.034
It's okay, Morris.
No.

24:24.100 --> 24:25.434
No, no, it's not okay.

24:25.501 --> 24:27.601
It's-It's not okay. I...

24:27.668 --> 24:29.933
I'd like to say
something to everyone.

24:30.000 --> 24:33.434
I'm very sorry that I gave the
reprogramming device to Fayed.

24:33.501 --> 24:35.833
If I could take it
back, I would,

24:35.900 --> 24:37.334
but I can't.

24:37.401 --> 24:39.634
And if you don't think
I can do my job,

24:39.701 --> 24:41.000
Mr. Buchanan, then
I should leave.

24:42.967 --> 24:45.800
But I <i>can</i> do my job.

24:47.034 --> 24:48.501
Okay, Morris.

24:48.567 --> 24:51.000
Give your task
full priority.

24:51.067 --> 24:52.467
Thank you.

24:52.534 --> 24:54.167
Mr. Buchanan, I have to disagree

24:54.234 --> 24:55.401
with your decision.

24:57.234 --> 24:59.301
I'm sorry, Morris,
but I just don't
think you're ready.

24:59.367 --> 25:01.967
Your objection is noted, Nadia.

25:02.034 --> 25:03.601
My decision stands.

25:17.067 --> 25:18.367
You're wasting your energy.

25:18.434 --> 25:20.601
And you're distracting me.

25:20.668 --> 25:23.267
The President's gonna die.

25:23.334 --> 25:25.701
There's nothing
you can do about it.

25:27.668 --> 25:29.867
People are starting
to ask questions

25:29.933 --> 25:30.967
about Tom's whereabouts.

25:31.034 --> 25:32.501
Are you on schedule?

25:32.567 --> 25:35.067
I told you the bomb would
be ready in 30 minutes,

25:35.134 --> 25:37.100
and I meant it.
Okay.

25:38.401 --> 25:39.867
(exhales)

25:40.933 --> 25:42.501
Is there a problem?

25:42.567 --> 25:44.000
No.

25:44.067 --> 25:47.401
You can't go soft
on us now, Reed.

25:48.900 --> 25:50.833
REED:
No, it's...

25:50.900 --> 25:52.833
it's just starting to hit me.

25:52.900 --> 25:55.534
(sighs):
What we're about to do.

25:55.601 --> 25:58.334
My God...

25:58.401 --> 26:01.734
we're killing the President
of the United States.

26:01.800 --> 26:03.867
We're trying to
save this country.

26:21.767 --> 26:25.001
--Chloe, look at the function
prototypes on Morris's report.

26:25.068 --> 26:26.334
What's the problem?

26:26.400 --> 26:29.267
Take a look.

26:29.334 --> 26:31.068
You mean the missing sectors?

26:31.133 --> 26:32.968
 <i>Yes,</i> the missing sectors.

26:33.034 --> 26:35.300
Did Buchanan
make a mistake

26:35.367 --> 26:37.034
by reinstating Morris too soon?

26:37.100 --> 26:39.701
No. The Pentagon put
a file lock on these items.

26:39.767 --> 26:41.767
I told him we could
back-fill them later.

26:41.834 --> 26:43.667
It's not gonna be
to anyone's benefit

26:43.734 --> 26:45.001
if you're covering for him.

26:45.068 --> 26:47.701
I'm not.

26:49.968 --> 26:51.968
Fine.

27:02.634 --> 27:04.968
Morris, I need you
to tell me the truth.

27:05.034 --> 27:06.601
Have you been drinking?

27:06.667 --> 27:08.567
I just had a couple
of beers, love.

27:08.634 --> 27:10.068
I didn't think
anyone would mind.

27:10.133 --> 27:11.100
Don't be sarcastic.

27:11.167 --> 27:12.534
Your data merge is incomplete.

27:12.601 --> 27:14.034
I had to cover for you.

27:14.100 --> 27:16.601
I just told Nadia...
Whoa, wait.
What was incomplete?

27:16.667 --> 27:19.367
Look.

27:19.434 --> 27:21.601
Oh, for crying out loud,
these sectors are irrelevant.

27:21.667 --> 27:24.233
I only fill them in when
I file my final report.

27:24.300 --> 27:26.334
You know that Nadia
wants these completed.

27:26.400 --> 27:28.034
Nadia only wants to
prove to Buchanan

27:28.100 --> 27:31.034
that she was right and
that I shouldn't be here.

27:31.100 --> 27:34.068
No one is out to get you.

27:34.133 --> 27:36.500
Look, even I know

27:36.567 --> 27:37.867
that I shouldn't be here.

27:37.934 --> 27:40.867
There's a big part of me
that wants to go home,

27:40.934 --> 27:44.001
crawl into bed and forget
this day ever happened.

27:44.068 --> 27:47.334
But I'm staying,
because CTU needs me.

28:10.167 --> 28:12.133
(sighs)

28:38.767 --> 28:42.034
"He brought me out
of a horrible pit,

28:42.100 --> 28:46.001
"set my feet upon a rock...

28:46.068 --> 28:49.001
and established my goings."

28:50.734 --> 28:53.801
One step at a time, Charles.

28:56.801 --> 28:58.901
One step at a time.

28:58.968 --> 29:00.634
Logan's almost ready--
we should be able

29:00.701 --> 29:02.567
to get to the Consulate
within 45 minutes.

29:02.634 --> 29:05.701
What have you got on Markov?
We ran his name through
the interagency sub-net.

29:05.767 --> 29:06.901
He's a career diplomat.

29:06.968 --> 29:10.100
Assigned Consul General in '96.

29:10.167 --> 29:11.634
Prior to that,
worked in the Ministry

29:11.701 --> 29:13.567
of Foreign Affairs
for the Russian Federation.

29:13.634 --> 29:16.701
No red flags from NSA,
Interpol or CIA.

29:16.767 --> 29:18.334
As far as they're concerned,

29:18.400 --> 29:20.867
he's clean.

29:22.300 --> 29:23.834
Jack, what if Logan
isn't telling the truth?

29:23.901 --> 29:25.934
We're out of options--
I have to trust him.

29:26.001 --> 29:28.034
You know, we have
no jurisdiction
at the Consulate.

29:28.100 --> 29:31.100
Just make sure you have
teams ready in case
Logan's lead pans out.

29:31.167 --> 29:33.068
All right.

29:33.133 --> 29:34.500
O'Brian.

29:34.567 --> 29:36.968
Chloe, contact
the Highway Patrol.

29:37.034 --> 29:38.567
Have them clear
a ground corridor

29:38.634 --> 29:41.133
from Logan's estate
to the Russian Consulate.
Yes, sir.

29:43.534 --> 29:45.133
(phone rings)

29:45.200 --> 29:46.801
(Chloe sighs)

29:46.867 --> 29:49.467
(phone rings)

29:51.167 --> 29:52.634
Hello?

29:52.701 --> 29:54.734
Yeah, hi. This is Jeannie.
You left me a message?

29:54.801 --> 29:56.534
Yeah. Thanks
for getting back to me.

29:56.601 --> 30:00.167
So, what can I do for you?
Look, I know you talked
to Morris earlier,

30:00.233 --> 30:02.467
and that this is probably
way out of line

30:02.534 --> 30:04.068
and against
your confidentiality agreement,

30:04.133 --> 30:06.367
but it's just,
I'm really worried about him.

30:06.434 --> 30:08.601
I-I'm sorry, I haven't
spoken to Morris

30:08.667 --> 30:11.068
since I left the program
three years ago.

30:16.534 --> 30:18.601
Hello?

30:18.667 --> 30:19.867
Okay.

30:19.934 --> 30:21.901
Sorry to bother you.

30:24.233 --> 30:25.701
Have you seen Morris?

30:25.767 --> 30:27.734
No. I'm sorry.

30:27.801 --> 30:29.400
(sighs)

30:35.100 --> 30:36.767
Is Morris down there?

30:36.834 --> 30:38.934
MAN:
I haven't seen him.

30:51.133 --> 30:53.133
Morris?
Chloe?

30:53.200 --> 30:55.133
Morris, what are you
doing in there?
What? Wait.

30:55.200 --> 30:56.534
Open the door!
Open the door!

30:56.601 --> 30:58.034
What the bloody hell
is going on?

30:58.100 --> 30:59.801
I called your
sponsor, Jeannie.
She said she

30:59.867 --> 31:01.233
hasn't talked
to you in three years.

31:01.300 --> 31:02.968
Are you out of your
bleeding mind?!

31:03.034 --> 31:05.233
I trusted you-- I put my
job on the line for you.

31:05.300 --> 31:06.801
You lied to me.
I didn't lie to you.

31:06.867 --> 31:09.133
Yes, you did.
I didn't lie to you--
Jeannie's not

31:09.200 --> 31:10.500
my sponsor anymore;
Ted is.

31:10.567 --> 31:11.601
Ted?
Yeah.

31:11.667 --> 31:12.867
Remember Ted with the hair?

31:12.934 --> 31:14.100
 <i>He's</i> my sponsor.

31:14.167 --> 31:15.801
I called him
just like I told you.

31:15.867 --> 31:17.867
Check if you want--
I'll give you his number.

31:17.934 --> 31:19.634
Not now!

31:26.667 --> 31:28.100
I don't know what to say.

31:28.167 --> 31:29.968
I was worried about you.

31:30.034 --> 31:34.267
Marching into a men's room
isn't worried, it's obsessed.

31:34.334 --> 31:37.567
Now, I appreciate
your concern.

31:37.634 --> 31:39.500
I <i>love</i> your concern.

31:39.567 --> 31:42.567
But, darling,
you have to take a look

31:42.634 --> 31:44.500
at what's going on in your head.

31:44.567 --> 31:47.500
It's not pretty.

31:50.534 --> 31:52.133
Sorry.

32:05.834 --> 32:07.334
(sighs)

32:19.634 --> 32:20.801
Mr. President.

32:23.734 --> 32:24.701
From the Attorney General, sir.

32:24.767 --> 32:26.034
The executive order

32:26.100 --> 32:28.001
authorizing
President Logan's release.

32:37.767 --> 32:39.467
Thank you, Melinda.

32:39.534 --> 32:40.701
The communications
director

32:40.767 --> 32:42.133
wanted you to know
that they'll be ready

32:42.200 --> 32:43.667
for an on-camera
rehearsal with Assad

32:43.734 --> 32:44.667
in five minutes.

32:44.734 --> 32:46.667
Fine.

32:46.734 --> 32:47.801
Melinda?

32:47.867 --> 32:49.467
Have we heard
from Tom Lennox?

32:49.534 --> 32:50.934
No, sir.

32:51.001 --> 32:53.300
I've been trying him.
There's no answer at his office.

32:53.367 --> 32:55.801
Find him. I want him present
for Assad's statement.

32:55.867 --> 32:57.034
Yes, sir.

33:06.834 --> 33:09.834
(coughing)

33:09.901 --> 33:11.334
(coughing continues)

33:18.634 --> 33:20.467
(coughing)
Sir.

33:20.534 --> 33:22.100
I'm gonna take
that off of you,

33:22.167 --> 33:23.534
and I'm gonna
clean up that cut,

33:23.601 --> 33:24.934
but if you try
to call out,

33:25.001 --> 33:27.133
Carson will kill you
and I cannot stop him.

33:27.200 --> 33:29.267
Do you understand?

33:29.334 --> 33:30.334
Okay.

33:33.100 --> 33:35.968
(coughing continues)

33:36.034 --> 33:38.467
You have got to put
a stop to this, Reed.

33:38.534 --> 33:39.801
No, Mr. Lennox.

33:39.867 --> 33:43.100
When this is done and the
President is out of the way,

33:43.167 --> 33:46.100
I think that you will
see things differently.

33:46.167 --> 33:48.100
I think that you will
see that this is...

33:48.167 --> 33:50.334
better for
our country.

33:50.400 --> 33:52.534
No, you're going to destroy

33:52.601 --> 33:54.001
this country, Reed.

33:54.068 --> 33:55.367
You're just as bad as Fayed.

33:57.034 --> 33:58.034
No, no.

33:58.100 --> 33:59.100
There must have been a moment

33:59.167 --> 34:00.534
when you were
onboard with this plan.

34:05.167 --> 34:06.667
Were you playing us
from the beginning?

34:06.734 --> 34:09.266
Hmm?
Were you?

34:09.333 --> 34:11.601
Or did you change
your mind along the way?

34:11.667 --> 34:14.100
I need to know.

34:14.167 --> 34:15.132
Then know this.

34:15.199 --> 34:19.001
I was against you
from the start.

34:21.801 --> 34:23.500
(phone ringing)

34:29.833 --> 34:31.601
That's...
(phone ringing)

34:31.667 --> 34:32.734
...very disappointing.

34:36.100 --> 34:37.068
Hello.

34:37.132 --> 34:38.967
Yes, hello, Melinda.

34:39.034 --> 34:40.734
Oh, yes, I'm just
with Tom right now.

34:40.801 --> 34:43.068
He's just
finishing the briefing.

34:43.167 --> 34:44.333
You know, I-I understand.

34:44.400 --> 34:46.001
I will let Mr. Lennox
know right away.

34:46.068 --> 34:47.367
Okay? Thanks.

34:49.434 --> 34:50.734
The President is
asking for Lennox.

34:50.801 --> 34:52.001
We've gotta move.
I'm almost done.

35:29.901 --> 35:31.034
Finished.

35:34.267 --> 35:35.601
It's armed.
Okay.

35:35.667 --> 35:36.968
Now...

35:37.034 --> 35:38.734
this is the detonator.

35:38.801 --> 35:42.567
Press 6-2-4-Enter, and a
signal will activate the bomb.

35:42.634 --> 35:45.001
Okay. 6-2-4-Enter.

35:46.167 --> 35:47.500
Once the signal's been sent,

35:47.567 --> 35:49.701
it'll take 15 seconds
for the chemicals to intermix.

35:49.767 --> 35:51.834
The kill radius
is only ten feet.

35:51.901 --> 35:53.133
Make sure Palmer's inside it.

35:55.934 --> 35:57.534
You sure you can do it?

35:57.601 --> 36:00.467
I'm the only one who can get
close enough to that podium

36:00.534 --> 36:01.901
without attracting attention.

36:03.467 --> 36:05.100
I can do this.

37:04.767 --> 37:06.501
--All right, everyone,
rehearsal's up in five minutes.

37:06.568 --> 37:07.967
Please notify the President.

37:14.000 --> 37:15.301
(clearing throat)

37:30.334 --> 37:31.867
Excuse me, could we have

37:31.934 --> 37:32.900
some water for
the podium?

37:32.967 --> 37:33.934
Sure.
Thank you.

37:35.634 --> 37:38.100
The President
is traveling.

37:57.934 --> 37:59.267
Before we continue,

37:59.334 --> 38:01.900
I would just like to
express my appreciation.

38:01.967 --> 38:04.000
You're taking a great
risk, Mr. President.

38:04.067 --> 38:07.334
You and I both
are sharing that risk, sir,

38:07.401 --> 38:09.601
and maybe that,
in and of itself,

38:09.668 --> 38:11.100
is <i>something</i>
of a victory.

38:11.167 --> 38:13.634
I just hope that someone
will listen to our appeal.

38:13.700 --> 38:15.634
You sound skeptical.

38:16.934 --> 38:18.134
The people we're

38:18.201 --> 38:20.767
trying to reach, they
abandoned the political process

38:20.833 --> 38:22.201
a long time ago.

38:22.267 --> 38:25.000
All we need to do
is create a foundation...

38:25.067 --> 38:26.900
to build on.

38:26.967 --> 38:29.067
The rest
will follow.

38:31.134 --> 38:32.100
Reed.

38:34.100 --> 38:35.833
This is Hamri Al-Assad.

38:35.900 --> 38:38.634
Mr. Pollock is our
deputy chief of staff.

38:38.700 --> 38:40.334
How do you do?
Hello, sir.

38:40.401 --> 38:41.668
If you wouldn't
mind getting comfortable

38:41.733 --> 38:43.201
behind the podium,
I'd like to speak

38:43.267 --> 38:45.034
to Reed for
a minute, please.
Of course.

38:46.900 --> 38:48.334
Mr. Al-Assad?

38:48.401 --> 38:49.534
ASSAD:
Yes.

38:49.601 --> 38:51.134
Would you like to review
the teleprompter copy

38:51.201 --> 38:52.234
before you rehearse?

38:52.301 --> 38:53.568
ASSAD:
That would be fine.

38:53.634 --> 38:55.634
I've been trying to reach
Tom for the past hour.

38:55.700 --> 38:58.267
Is there something
I should know?

38:58.334 --> 39:00.668
Something you should
know, Mr. President?

39:00.733 --> 39:02.568
Reed...

39:02.634 --> 39:04.833
I know how Tom feels
about this address,

39:04.900 --> 39:06.534
but I <i>was</i> under
the impression

39:06.601 --> 39:07.967
that he put
his opposition

39:08.034 --> 39:12.134
aside and was working <i>with</i> me
to make this policy succeed.

39:12.201 --> 39:14.967
Well, I-I'm sure that that's a
valid impression, Mr. President.

39:15.034 --> 39:16.634
Then he'll be here.

39:16.700 --> 39:19.900
Yes. Yes, sir, he will,
he will be here.

39:19.967 --> 39:21.700
Good.

40:04.900 --> 40:07.967
(alarm blaring)

40:13.234 --> 40:15.601
(alarm stops)

40:19.301 --> 40:21.967
You try that again and I'll
kill you, you understand?

40:23.301 --> 40:24.634
I should kill
you anyway.

40:24.700 --> 40:26.900
With the President dead,
nobody's going to think too hard

40:26.967 --> 40:29.100
about why his chief of staff
hanged himself.

40:39.301 --> 40:40.900
All right.
Here we go for rehearsal.

40:40.967 --> 40:43.034
I'm gonna go and check
on Tom, Mr. President.

41:20.634 --> 41:23.634
I'll give you a
seven-second countdown.

41:23.733 --> 41:26.434
The last four seconds
will be silent.

41:31.167 --> 41:33.467
All right, here we go
in seven...

41:33.534 --> 41:36.634
six... five...

41:36.700 --> 41:38.000
What is this?

41:42.067 --> 41:42.668
Bomb!

41:54.967 --> 41:55.934
Mr. President!

41:58.034 --> 42:00.000
(alarm blaring)

42:15.000 --> 42:16.334
Let's go.

42:18.267 --> 42:19.434
Fan out. Find him.

42:34.534 --> 42:36.134
Got him!

42:37.601 --> 42:39.234
Code 5 in Sector Three.
The Citadel has

42:39.301 --> 42:40.601
been hit.
Send a medical team.

42:40.668 --> 42:42.700
I repeat, Citadel is down.
Send a medical team now.
