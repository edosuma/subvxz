00:12.440 --> 00:16.410
I'm going to return
to the hometown we lost.

00:17.700 --> 00:19.710
That's all I care about now.

00:21.120 --> 00:24.329
I chose to be a soldier in the hopes
of joining the Military Police

00:24.330 --> 00:26.580
so I could work in the safety
of the interior.

00:27.840 --> 00:30.340
Why do <i>you</i> want to be a soldier?

00:32.840 --> 00:33.470
I...

00:34.590 --> 00:36.550
I decided I have to kill them.

00:37.510 --> 00:41.070
I decided I have to slaughter
all the Titans...

00:41.680 --> 00:44.030
...with my own two hands.

00:58.820 --> 01:04.290
So your encounter with the Titans
<i>didn't</i> break your will?

01:06.120 --> 01:07.990
You'll be able to do it.

01:08.790 --> 01:11.300
Eren Jaeger, was it?

01:19.010 --> 01:24.230
You damn traitors!

03:20.170 --> 03:20.990
Eren!

03:29.060 --> 03:30.100
If only...

03:31.190 --> 03:33.680
If only I'd cut off their heads!

03:34.810 --> 03:37.019
That was the perfect chance!

03:37.020 --> 03:39.900
I should've been able to do it, so why?!

03:45.280 --> 03:48.740
That was it. There won't be another chance!

03:57.290 --> 03:59.000
Everyone, jump away from the wall!

04:07.260 --> 04:08.970
It got Ymir!

04:10.930 --> 04:12.310
And somebody else, too!

04:16.110 --> 04:17.149
He ate 'em!

04:20.029 --> 04:21.820
Th-This can't be...

04:23.450 --> 04:24.660
Bertholdt...

04:36.420 --> 04:38.999
All soldiers, prepare to attack!

04:39.000 --> 04:40.880
We're taking down the Colossal Titan!

04:41.630 --> 04:43.520
It's a threat to all of humanity!

04:44.340 --> 04:46.430
Swarm the huge bastard!

05:08.740 --> 05:10.780
Just like the reports said, he's slow!

05:11.490 --> 05:13.499
It might be big, but that's it!

05:13.500 --> 05:16.790
Compared to the Titans we
normally fight, this'll be easy!

05:17.540 --> 05:18.670
We've got this!

05:19.040 --> 05:21.470
Now's our chance! Slice up his neck!

05:27.340 --> 05:28.180
Too hot!

05:29.050 --> 05:31.100
Everyone, fall back!

05:38.400 --> 05:39.400
My hand!

05:39.401 --> 05:41.470
Water! Bring water!

05:42.780 --> 05:44.450
He's trying to disappear again?

05:45.070 --> 05:46.990
No, something is different.

05:48.070 --> 05:50.239
The last time he vanished instantly,

05:50.240 --> 05:55.449
but now, he's maintaining his form
and emitting heat like a furnace.

05:55.450 --> 05:57.840
If he keeps protecting
himself with steam...

06:01.750 --> 06:03.920
We're unable to attack him with ODM gear!

06:04.130 --> 06:06.100
Wh-What do we do?!

06:07.130 --> 06:09.550
We can't do anything. We wait.

06:10.550 --> 06:13.929
Squads three and four,
take position behind the target.

06:13.930 --> 06:15.309
Rashad has command.

06:15.310 --> 06:15.890
Got it!

06:16.560 --> 06:18.479
Squad two will wait here.

06:18.480 --> 06:20.439
Lauda is in command.

06:20.440 --> 06:21.330
Understood!

06:22.360 --> 06:25.989
It's yet to be seen how long
he can keep his body burning, but...

06:25.990 --> 06:27.490
...eventually he has to come out.

06:28.150 --> 06:30.190
We wait for that moment to attack.

06:30.740 --> 06:31.510
Listen up.

06:32.410 --> 06:34.240
Forget about capturing them.

06:34.740 --> 06:35.520
Kill 'em...

06:35.950 --> 06:36.750
...and don't hesitate!

06:40.830 --> 06:44.250
Armin... and squad one follow me!

06:44.550 --> 06:46.300
We've got a date with the Armored Titan!

06:47.760 --> 06:48.630
Hot!

06:48.631 --> 06:51.310
Christa! Conny! Get further back!

06:52.590 --> 06:55.259
And take care of those
two injured soldiers.

06:55.260 --> 06:56.559
U-Um!

06:56.560 --> 06:57.290
Huh?

06:58.180 --> 07:00.810
Ymir can't possibly be dead yet.

07:01.310 --> 07:04.020
Please... Rescue her!

07:05.020 --> 07:05.790
Right.

07:06.440 --> 07:08.740
Where are Reiner and Bertholdt?!

07:10.030 --> 07:12.870
They don't have their ODM gear either!

07:13.570 --> 07:16.370
Please, go find and help those two!

07:46.900 --> 07:48.120
You shit...

07:48.650 --> 07:50.550
You big piece of shit.

07:51.240 --> 07:54.529
And here you wouldn't shut up
about a soldier's duty...

07:54.530 --> 07:59.530
During close combat training,
were you always holding back on me?

08:00.500 --> 08:03.240
You're so strong, it's ridiculous.

08:03.870 --> 08:06.420
I can't even move an inch of my body.

08:10.760 --> 08:13.800
I always thought you were a stand-up guy.

08:15.090 --> 08:18.309
Someone who remained calm,
regardless of the situation...

08:18.310 --> 08:21.810
A guy who put your comrades
ahead of yourself...

08:22.890 --> 08:24.060
And I...

08:24.900 --> 08:29.940
To think at one time I wished...
to be as strong as you someday.

08:36.700 --> 08:37.950
That did nothing!

08:42.830 --> 08:44.260
Eren's attack didn't...

08:45.330 --> 08:47.290
And my blades don't work either?!

08:51.090 --> 08:54.090
What's worse, unlike Annie,
his whole body is hard!

08:58.680 --> 09:00.060
Eren!

09:04.940 --> 09:07.350
Hey, Reiner...

09:08.650 --> 09:13.550
I don't know what kind of face
you're making right now, but...

09:16.860 --> 09:20.940
You guys... You really are
the worst pieces of shit.

09:22.040 --> 09:27.500
I bet in the history of mankind,
nobody's done anything as terrible as you.

09:36.970 --> 09:38.799
I've gotta erase you.

09:38.800 --> 09:41.720
You shouldn't be allowed to exist anymore.

09:43.020 --> 09:45.140
What the hell are you thinking?

09:45.560 --> 09:48.189
I've never felt so revolted before.

09:48.190 --> 09:52.520
Just remembering you and
your self-righteous face is making me sick.

09:54.570 --> 10:00.530
It makes me want to vomit.
You... big damn pest!

10:02.370 --> 10:05.340
It's time to exterminate you!

10:26.640 --> 10:29.140
Damn, that hurt, Annie!

10:29.940 --> 10:33.399
Haven't you ever heard the concept
of pulling your punches?

10:33.400 --> 10:36.279
I did it because you're
coming at me full-force.

10:36.280 --> 10:39.030
I've gotta respond with
equal strength of my own.

10:39.950 --> 10:42.029
And if you're a guy...

10:42.030 --> 10:46.699
...aren't you... supposed to be gentle
with this delicate body of mine?

10:46.700 --> 10:50.499
Huh? Your jokes aren't funny at all.

10:50.500 --> 10:52.467
If strength is the deciding factor,

10:52.492 --> 10:55.414
then why am I on my ass
and you're still standing?

10:56.010 --> 10:57.070
Well...

11:00.220 --> 11:02.310
I didn't throw you using my strength.

11:02.890 --> 11:07.920
It's a technique used to protect yourself
against an opponent stronger than you.

11:10.310 --> 11:13.399
If I were you, I'd think about learning it.

11:13.400 --> 11:16.780
All right, already! Why
don't we take a break?

11:28.870 --> 11:29.750
Annie!

11:30.160 --> 11:31.579
Surrender!

11:31.580 --> 11:32.879
I surrender!

11:32.880 --> 11:37.499
Surrender? Try to learn something first
before you surrender.

11:37.500 --> 11:41.509
Learn how to use your strength and
the proper way to speak to women!

11:41.510 --> 11:44.509
All right! I promise I'll learn,
so let go already!

11:44.510 --> 11:47.680
Yeah? Do you want to learn that badly?

11:57.020 --> 11:59.320
Why the hell did Reiner
come flying this way?

11:59.780 --> 12:00.670
Hey, Annie.

12:01.860 --> 12:03.770
I wanna learn that move, too.

12:05.450 --> 12:06.410
Show me.

12:11.080 --> 12:12.160
I don't know...

12:12.790 --> 12:15.602
That move is meant to be
used against humans,

12:15.627 --> 12:18.194
so I don't think you
have any use for it.

12:18.920 --> 12:22.690
But... I'm interested to see if it works...

12:23.430 --> 12:24.930
...on a beast like you.

12:25.840 --> 12:28.270
Are you serious? It's happening...

12:28.760 --> 12:30.060
Hey, hey!

12:30.560 --> 12:32.099
Are they going at it?

12:32.100 --> 12:33.439
It's the big showdown!

12:33.440 --> 12:34.020
...Who'll win?!

12:34.021 --> 12:35.309
...Annie, you think?
...Who'll win?!

12:35.310 --> 12:36.939
Huh? Are you stupid?!

12:36.940 --> 12:38.770
I bet my whole dinner on Mikasa!

12:39.110 --> 12:40.760
What do you think, Eren?

12:42.530 --> 12:43.700
I...

12:48.950 --> 12:50.380
Which one, I wonder?

12:57.920 --> 12:58.710
Huh?

12:59.380 --> 13:02.170
How did that turn out in the end?

13:02.840 --> 13:05.720
No... Why am I remembering it now?

13:05.930 --> 13:09.050
Is this what they call having
your life flash before your eyes?

13:11.310 --> 13:13.980
Actually, who gives a shit anymore?

13:14.770 --> 13:18.990
I don't think I've felt...
this awful in my whole life.

13:20.020 --> 13:21.109
Eren!

13:21.110 --> 13:24.240
Don't do it! You can't win in a slugfest!

13:24.570 --> 13:26.069
Run this way!

13:26.070 --> 13:28.590
Eren! Don't try to fight him!

13:37.620 --> 13:38.250
Eren!

13:39.840 --> 13:40.590
This is bad!

13:41.050 --> 13:42.300
Did he lose control?!

14:05.490 --> 14:07.359
He threw the Armored Titan!

14:07.360 --> 14:09.030
Wait... Isn't that...

14:09.950 --> 14:11.520
...the technique Annie used?

14:12.620 --> 14:15.569
I don't know what the hell
you guys are trying

14:15.594 --> 14:18.079
to accomplish by doing all this, but...

14:18.080 --> 14:22.910
Now that I think of it, your plan
has been full of flaws from the start!

14:24.130 --> 14:26.300
Your biggest mistake was this!

14:26.550 --> 14:29.800
You should've thought twice
about teaching me how to fight!

14:32.970 --> 14:35.560
It's working! I've got him now!

14:35.930 --> 14:37.260
I still have a chance!

14:41.980 --> 14:43.070
Think again!

14:47.240 --> 14:48.290
Eren!

14:48.780 --> 14:50.870
You're not getting away from this!

15:07.460 --> 15:08.630
He did it!

15:16.720 --> 15:18.520
Eren! Can you hear me?!

15:19.140 --> 15:22.020
Run away! Get closer to the wall!

15:22.520 --> 15:25.770
Their goal is to kidnap and take you away!

15:26.110 --> 15:29.070
We've gotta escape and
prevent that from happening!

15:30.450 --> 15:34.360
But, Armin, Reiner isn't going to
let us do as we please!

15:41.460 --> 15:43.500
It's dangerous here! Get back, you two!

16:10.280 --> 16:10.690
Huh?

16:14.700 --> 16:17.160
Nice, Eren! Good call!

16:17.580 --> 16:19.000
He's back in control again.

16:19.330 --> 16:21.930
Yeah, but like you were saying,

16:22.410 --> 16:24.770
it'll be almost impossible
to escape Reiner.

16:34.220 --> 16:35.490
What the hell?

16:38.760 --> 16:44.100
I knew it... The Colossal Titan.
Why did that bastard show up here?!

16:47.020 --> 16:48.070
Where's Eren?

16:48.480 --> 16:49.630
What's the situation?

16:50.690 --> 16:52.400
Eren and the others are that way!

16:58.910 --> 16:59.620
Eren?!

17:00.160 --> 17:02.620
Is that Eren's Titan form?

17:03.040 --> 17:04.329
Listen up, Eren.

17:04.329 --> 17:07.689
If you're gonna escape, we've got
to find a way to halt Reiner

17:07.690 --> 17:09.630
and buy you some time!

17:10.550 --> 17:14.780
Can you break his leg with
another one of those joint locks?

17:15.930 --> 17:18.429
Our blades don't seem to work on him,

17:18.430 --> 17:21.970
so use your head and figure out
the best course of action!

17:33.990 --> 17:34.740
Mikasa!

17:35.070 --> 17:37.220
Use these. It's the rest of my blades.

17:38.160 --> 17:39.220
I'm counting on you!

17:43.450 --> 17:47.209
This time, running away
is a guaranteed victory.

17:47.210 --> 17:50.670
It's you guys that are screwed
for revealing what you are.

17:51.250 --> 17:53.760
You're the ones backed into a corner.

18:06.350 --> 18:06.890
He's fast!

18:11.820 --> 18:12.859
Shit!

18:12.860 --> 18:14.640
Leg! His leg!

18:17.780 --> 18:19.909
Don't stay on the ground! Eren!

18:19.910 --> 18:20.740
Stand up!

18:25.540 --> 18:28.290
Dammit! His tackle is too much to handle!

18:31.170 --> 18:34.629
Shit... Since when could he move so quick?

18:34.630 --> 18:36.380
Are we completely useless here?!

18:37.550 --> 18:38.759
No...

18:38.760 --> 18:44.350
If his entire body was hard like stone,
there's no way he could move like that.

18:44.970 --> 18:47.809
In the armor they used in wars of the past,

18:47.810 --> 18:51.560
it had sections at the joints not covered
in metal to allow for movement.

18:52.520 --> 18:55.029
Like at the armpits and groin...

18:55.030 --> 18:57.940
And also... the spot behind the knee.

19:01.280 --> 19:02.780
I can't evade it...

19:03.910 --> 19:05.950
Since I'll get knocked over anyways...

19:07.250 --> 19:08.660
Bring it!

19:09.670 --> 19:11.080
Gimme that neck!

19:12.130 --> 19:15.130
You're mine!

19:19.300 --> 19:21.929
Yeah! That's it, Eren!

19:21.930 --> 19:24.890
I've got 'em! Now
it's a battle of strength!

19:27.520 --> 19:28.270
This freak...

19:30.100 --> 19:30.850
Not enough!

19:40.820 --> 19:41.740
Mikasa!

19:43.030 --> 19:43.740
She cut him!

19:50.000 --> 19:52.290
He can't fight back as much anymore!

20:01.590 --> 20:02.470
You've got this!

20:03.010 --> 20:04.470
Go for it, Eren!

20:05.100 --> 20:07.429
Tear the head off his neck!

20:07.430 --> 20:10.230
Pull the traitor outta there!

20:12.520 --> 20:14.149
I can win!

20:14.150 --> 20:17.320
Against Reiner... I can win!

20:30.040 --> 20:31.709
Wh-What the...?

20:31.710 --> 20:33.459
Heh, it's useless.

20:33.460 --> 20:35.540
Keep at it! Don't let up!

20:45.680 --> 20:46.740
He stopped...

20:49.060 --> 20:50.180
But why there?

21:06.450 --> 21:08.199
Be on your guard!

21:08.200 --> 21:09.410
He's calling in Titans!

21:17.960 --> 21:20.549
No other Titans spotted in the area!

21:20.550 --> 21:21.800
What a useless struggle.

21:22.380 --> 21:25.179
Try screaming for help with
your head ripped off, you idiot!

21:25.180 --> 21:26.760
Look, he's tearing it off!

21:28.220 --> 21:30.310
What's with the Armored Titan?

21:30.510 --> 21:32.460
Why'd he scream like that?

21:41.820 --> 21:42.580
Hey...

21:43.490 --> 21:45.320
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

21:58.290 --> 22:01.130
Above you! Look out!

23:41.480 --> 23:45.420
The battle between Eren and the Armored
Titan comes to an abrupt conclusion.

23:46.150 --> 23:47.740
With its fall from the wall,

23:47.940 --> 23:53.070
Mikasa is injured by the Colossal Titan
and Hannes comes running to her side.

23:54.160 --> 23:59.460
To protect Eren through his reckless
behavior... to stand proudly at his side...

24:00.370 --> 24:04.570
...that is, and has always been,
the wish of Mikasa and Armin.

24:05.750 --> 24:09.080
