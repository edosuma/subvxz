00:00.117 --> 00:02.484
<i>Back in the '90s,
dating-themed TV game shows</i>

00:02.570 --> 00:04.179
<i>hit a peak like never before.</i>

00:04.289 --> 00:06.093
<i>Shows like "Blind Date," "Studs,"</i>

00:06.191 --> 00:08.023
<i>"Personals" ruled the airwaves...</i>

00:08.109 --> 00:10.080
<i>at least between midnight and 2:00 a.m.</i>

00:10.178 --> 00:12.967
<i>But the king of them all was
the monster hit "Singled Out,"</i>

00:13.068 --> 00:14.451
<i>and there was no bigger fan of the show</i>

00:14.553 --> 00:16.417
<i>than our own Principal Glascott.</i>

00:16.612 --> 00:17.831
All right, everybody.

00:17.940 --> 00:20.197
I've got big Valentine's Day news.

00:20.293 --> 00:23.060
We are gonna put on our own
version of "Singled Out."

00:23.129 --> 00:25.029
- That MTV dating show?
- Exactly.

00:25.131 --> 00:26.797
With us teachers as the contestants.

00:26.866 --> 00:29.099
It'll be for charity,
and the students will love it.

00:29.201 --> 00:30.768
Oh, Barry's coming for Valentine's Day.

00:30.836 --> 00:31.869
I'm pretty sure he'll want to play

00:31.938 --> 00:33.504
'cause he's super competitive.

00:33.572 --> 00:34.505
It's often unhealthy.

00:34.573 --> 00:35.906
In a supreme act of chivalry,

00:35.975 --> 00:37.608
I say my love Julie
must bow out of this.

00:37.677 --> 00:39.610
The idea of dozens of men
vying for her hand

00:39.679 --> 00:41.478
- sickens her.
- I'm fine with it.

00:41.547 --> 00:43.919
Trying to be so brave,
but it's tearing her up inside.

00:43.990 --> 00:45.049
It's not.

00:45.117 --> 00:47.051
Love demands that I remove
Julie from this contest.

00:47.153 --> 00:48.252
For her sanity.

00:48.321 --> 00:50.521
I am good with whatever
you need me to do, John,

00:50.589 --> 00:51.822
and Rick's fine with it, too.

00:51.924 --> 00:53.157
Thank you.

00:53.192 --> 00:55.259
And I thought that our own Wilma Howell

00:55.328 --> 00:57.161
would serve as our bachelorette.

00:57.229 --> 01:00.898
You? Selecting from 50 bachelors? Yowza!

01:01.033 --> 01:01.999
No. Pass.

01:02.101 --> 01:04.134
Is there romance in the air for Wilma?

01:04.236 --> 01:05.736
This is weird and out of bounds.

01:05.805 --> 01:07.237
It'll be fun. Just do it.

01:07.340 --> 01:08.172
- Yeah, no.
- Please.

01:08.274 --> 01:09.039
- No, no, no.
- Do it.

01:09.141 --> 01:10.107
- No.
- Come on.

01:10.209 --> 01:11.375
Fine. If it'll end this.

01:11.477 --> 01:13.711
All right. She loves it. Okay.

01:13.779 --> 01:15.079
And for William Penn's

01:15.147 --> 01:17.881
saucy former Playmate
sidekick, Jenny McCarthy?

01:17.950 --> 01:20.084
Choice is pretty obvious.

01:20.186 --> 01:21.385
Liz Flemming.

01:21.454 --> 01:24.154
Oh, Liz is actually in Upstate New York

01:24.223 --> 01:25.199
showing her dogs...

01:25.224 --> 01:27.224
not competitively, just around.

01:27.293 --> 01:29.159
Oh, okay. Well, I guess
we could use Lainey.

01:29.205 --> 01:30.127
Oh, so, I'm second choice?

01:30.189 --> 01:31.195
Do you want the job, or...?

01:31.297 --> 01:32.429
- No, I'll do it.
- Great.

01:32.465 --> 01:34.264
So, that only leaves selecting the host.

01:34.333 --> 01:37.901
We need someone that is
camera-ready, charismatic,

01:37.970 --> 01:41.005
really comfortable in front of a crowd.

01:41.073 --> 01:42.740
How about Johnny Atkins?

01:42.842 --> 01:44.675
Yes! My big break!

01:44.777 --> 01:46.477
Hollywood, here I come.

01:46.545 --> 01:49.279
Hey, what a great idea, CB,
to have Johnny do it.

01:49.382 --> 01:51.815
So, I guess we're all set, then, right?

01:51.917 --> 01:53.350
Oh, Johnny, I have one question.

01:53.419 --> 01:54.952
Do you have your own
game-show microphone?

01:55.054 --> 01:56.420
Uh, no.

01:56.489 --> 01:57.755
Oh, that's too bad, because...

01:57.857 --> 01:59.790
I do!

01:59.892 --> 02:02.760
♪ One of these days,
you're gonna get outta here ♪

02:02.862 --> 02:05.796
♪ Live your life and finally be free ♪

02:05.898 --> 02:08.732
♪ Go where you wanna go,

02:08.800 --> 02:12.369
♪ Someday, you will say
"Those were the days" ♪

02:12.471 --> 02:14.671
<i>It was February 12th, 1990-something,</i>

02:14.774 --> 02:16.373
<i>and it had been a week
since I'd found out</i>

02:16.442 --> 02:18.675
<i>CB had more-than-friend feelings for me,</i>

02:18.778 --> 02:20.844
<i>which had me feeling a little uneasy.</i>

02:20.946 --> 02:22.413
Why are you crab-walking

02:22.515 --> 02:24.014
around the cafeteria
like you're Sebastian?

02:24.083 --> 02:25.949
I'm trying to avoid CB,
which I wouldn't have to do

02:26.052 --> 02:27.418
if you hadn't told me
he has a crush on me.

02:27.520 --> 02:28.919
I did? Wow.

02:29.021 --> 02:30.187
What Mr. Granger said

02:30.289 --> 02:31.855
while he was stealing
office supplies is true...

02:31.957 --> 02:33.157
I am no good at keeping secrets.

02:33.259 --> 02:34.591
See? I just did it again.

02:34.693 --> 02:36.560
I just don't want to hurt CB's feelings.

02:36.662 --> 02:38.629
But I guess since he doesn't
know that I know,

02:38.731 --> 02:39.830
all I have to do is play it cool,

02:39.932 --> 02:41.432
and everything will be normal.

02:41.534 --> 02:42.800
Hey, Lainey.

02:42.902 --> 02:44.401
Ooh, Lainey.

02:44.503 --> 02:45.869
You broke my heart.

02:45.971 --> 02:47.704
What?! I didn't even know!

02:47.773 --> 02:49.840
Uh, i-if I did,
I didn't do it on purpose.

02:49.942 --> 02:51.542
It's okay. It's just a cookie.

02:52.545 --> 02:54.211
Right. Obviously. Duh.

02:54.313 --> 02:56.480
That's...

02:56.582 --> 02:58.115
That's funny. That's a funny cookie.

02:58.217 --> 02:59.383
Happy Valentine's Day.

02:59.485 --> 03:01.218
Um, are you okay?

03:01.320 --> 03:03.020
- You're acting weird.
- Me? No.

03:03.089 --> 03:04.862
Anyway, thank you for
the nice cookie friend gift.

03:04.967 --> 03:06.466
Mm.

03:08.127 --> 03:09.326
Cool and normal... check and check.

03:09.428 --> 03:11.495
You be quiet. I just wasn't prepared.

03:11.597 --> 03:13.130
But now I can just behave
the same as normal,

03:13.232 --> 03:14.316
and our friendship won't change.

03:14.371 --> 03:15.399
Since that knowledge

03:15.468 --> 03:16.834
is in the prefrontal cortex
of your brain,

03:16.936 --> 03:19.103
you will not be able to behave
as if you didn't know.

03:19.205 --> 03:21.271
- It's science.
- Yeah?

03:21.373 --> 03:23.507
Well, I have my doubts about
this "science" you speak of.

03:23.609 --> 03:25.209
- You can't doubt science.
- Oh, I doubt it, all right.

03:25.311 --> 03:26.343
I doubt it all over.

03:26.445 --> 03:27.678
I will prove your science wrong.

03:27.780 --> 03:29.680
Then the challenge is on!
Science is gonna waste ya!

03:29.782 --> 03:30.881
You get a little scary.

03:30.950 --> 03:32.249
You come for science, you come for me.

03:32.351 --> 03:34.384
<i>As the challenge was on
between Wilma and me,</i>

03:34.487 --> 03:36.220
<i>Glascott was getting some
pushback of his own.</i>

03:36.322 --> 03:37.921
So, game show host-wise,
I was thinking of going

03:38.023 --> 03:40.691
with a modern Richard Dawson vibe.
What do you think?

03:40.793 --> 03:42.893
I think no kids
will be paying attention.

03:42.995 --> 03:43.927
Hm.

03:44.029 --> 03:45.429
Uhp, gotta go.

03:45.531 --> 03:46.934
Well, thanks for playing our game!

03:48.434 --> 03:49.700
Felicia feeling any better?

03:49.802 --> 03:51.001
She's doing just great.

03:51.103 --> 03:52.035
What makes you think she's not?

03:52.138 --> 03:53.103
She missed PE.

03:53.205 --> 03:54.805
Oh, that's weird. Felicia loves PE.

03:54.874 --> 03:56.907
This is the fifth class she's missed

03:57.009 --> 03:58.108
for medical reasons.

03:58.144 --> 03:59.843
- I didn't know she was sick.
- How could you not?

03:59.912 --> 04:02.479
You're the one who signed
all her excuse notes.

04:02.581 --> 04:04.047
This does look like my handwriting,

04:04.116 --> 04:05.582
but somehow better.

04:05.651 --> 04:07.317
Forging signatures, often the first step

04:07.342 --> 04:08.362
in a life of crime...

04:08.387 --> 04:09.820
or light secretarial work.

04:09.889 --> 04:12.656
I love how she crosses the T's
in "Glascott" with one line

04:12.725 --> 04:14.057
and then curls it under.

04:14.126 --> 04:16.293
- It's bold yet refined.
- 'Tis.

04:16.394 --> 04:17.728
Hey, do you mind if I keep it?

04:17.796 --> 04:19.630
I'm gonna get my rubber stamps
made just like this.

04:19.732 --> 04:22.432
Have at it, but if your niece
misses one more swim class,

04:22.535 --> 04:23.934
I may have to fail her for the semester.

04:24.036 --> 04:25.836
Wait. She's skipping swim class?

04:25.905 --> 04:27.538
I think I know what's going on.

04:27.640 --> 04:30.974
The recurring "medical" issue
is probably a womanly issue

04:31.076 --> 04:32.476
that she's too embarrassed
to talk about.

04:32.545 --> 04:33.810
It's... It's her, uh...

04:33.879 --> 04:36.980
It's her uteroshmmhmmm.

04:37.082 --> 04:38.382
Her "uteroshmmhmmm"?

04:38.484 --> 04:39.950
What's her uteroshmmhmmm?

04:40.052 --> 04:42.152
Her perioushmmhmmhmmhmm.

04:42.221 --> 04:43.520
I don't know how to make it
any more clear.

04:43.589 --> 04:44.821
Oh, that!

04:44.890 --> 04:45.956
She needs guidance.

04:46.025 --> 04:47.558
Can't she talk to her mom
about that stuff

04:47.626 --> 04:49.760
or any lady she sees in
the street that's not us?

04:49.828 --> 04:51.587
Come on, Rick.
My sister's working two jobs.

04:51.612 --> 04:52.597
Her plate is full.

04:52.631 --> 04:54.698
We can handle this. We're evolved.

04:54.767 --> 04:56.767
Well, to be honest with you,
I'm still a little unclear

04:56.835 --> 04:59.069
about some of the nuts
and bolts down there.

04:59.138 --> 05:00.704
Well, it's a good thing
that I'm emotionally equipped

05:00.773 --> 05:02.339
to handle delicate feminine topics.

05:02.408 --> 05:04.408
In fact, I just talked to
my secretary, Martha,

05:04.543 --> 05:05.776
about menopause

05:05.878 --> 05:08.879
and gently guided her into
the quiet winter of her life.

05:08.981 --> 05:10.080
<i>Glascott was willing to</i>

05:10.182 --> 05:11.448
<i>have an uncomfortable talk
with his niece,</i>

05:11.550 --> 05:13.050
<i>and I was proving to Wilma</i>

05:13.118 --> 05:15.852
<i>that things between CB and I
had never been more pleasant.</i>

05:15.955 --> 05:17.788
Oh, hello, CB. And how are you today?

05:17.890 --> 05:19.723
- I am fine.
- I'm fine, as well.

05:19.792 --> 05:21.024
Oh, I brought you one of my Snapples

05:21.126 --> 05:22.326
from the teachers' lounge fridge,

05:22.394 --> 05:24.528
and I would be happy to share,
as I always do with you.

05:24.597 --> 05:26.797
Thanks, but I'm more
into brewed tea now.

05:26.865 --> 05:28.332
Gently steeped young leaves

05:28.434 --> 05:30.119
paired with riveting conversation?

05:30.213 --> 05:31.401
Nothing better.

05:31.470 --> 05:32.836
I got something to show you.

05:32.905 --> 05:33.914
See? Couldn't be more normal.

05:33.939 --> 05:34.871
Yeah, it's early.

05:34.940 --> 05:36.573
Check out my new tea ball.

05:36.609 --> 05:39.776
Tea Spectator says
it's perfect for brewing oolong,

05:39.878 --> 05:41.278
which is kind of my jam these days.

05:41.380 --> 05:42.746
I had been dabbling in rooibos,

05:42.815 --> 05:45.582
but the subtle mouth feeling
of oolong...

05:45.651 --> 05:48.891
Now I know why they call it "oooo" long.

05:49.989 --> 05:52.189
This is the guy
you want to stay friends with?

05:52.258 --> 05:54.358
Lainey likes a nice Earl Grey.

05:54.460 --> 05:56.994
Does she occasionally enjoy chamomile?
Yes, she does.

05:57.062 --> 05:58.328
Let's go grab a cup of tea later

05:58.397 --> 05:59.997
in the same manner as we often do.

06:00.032 --> 06:01.465
Oh, I was hoping to see the movie "Babe"

06:01.533 --> 06:02.699
before it leaves theaters.

06:02.768 --> 06:04.935
The pig movie? That looks adorable!

06:05.004 --> 06:07.004
And since we're such good
friends, how 'bout I join you?

06:07.072 --> 06:08.639
Oh, sure, yeah, if you'd like.

06:08.707 --> 06:10.007
In fact, let's grab a bite after...

06:10.075 --> 06:11.174
two friends discussing a film.

06:11.277 --> 06:12.609
Sounds good.

06:12.678 --> 06:14.911
Wilma, can I use a Bunsen burner
in your classroom?

06:15.014 --> 06:16.480
My electric teapot's on the fritz.

06:16.548 --> 06:17.714
I don't get the whole
tea thing, but sure.

06:17.816 --> 06:19.283
Oh! Thank you.

06:21.086 --> 06:22.119
See? What'd I tell you?

06:22.187 --> 06:24.488
Lainey, 1, science, zippo.

06:24.556 --> 06:26.123
Despite knowing,
just like I said I would,

06:26.191 --> 06:27.357
I behaved totally normal.

06:27.426 --> 06:29.159
What I saw was you just totally

06:29.261 --> 06:30.460
normally asked CB out on a date.

06:30.562 --> 06:31.762
What? No!

06:31.830 --> 06:33.830
We're going, uh, to a movie
and then dinner and...

06:33.899 --> 06:35.178
Oh, my God. We're going on a date.

06:35.264 --> 06:37.501
<i>Yep, I had made things way
weirder between CB and I.</i>

06:37.603 --> 06:38.935
<i>As for Glascott,</i>

06:38.971 --> 06:41.004
<i>he took a totally
normal approach with Felicia.</i>

06:41.073 --> 06:42.295
I hope you didn't bring me in here

06:42.389 --> 06:45.042
to look at more clothes
for your "Singled Out"...

06:45.144 --> 06:46.276
Oh, no.

06:48.013 --> 06:50.580
Coach Mellor told me that
you've been skipping swim class.

06:50.683 --> 06:52.349
Oh, my God.

06:52.451 --> 06:53.984
It's okay. I'm here for you.

06:54.086 --> 06:56.053
And so are these.

06:56.155 --> 06:58.789
I didn't know which ones to get.
There's so many.

06:58.891 --> 07:01.491
There's max flow and wings, overnight.

07:01.560 --> 07:03.727
But it's not like you're gonna be
sleeping in the swimming pool.

07:03.752 --> 07:04.761
That would be crazy.

07:04.863 --> 07:06.897
Seriously, just stop talking.

07:06.972 --> 07:09.508
I tried to find "sport cut,"
but apparently,

07:09.602 --> 07:11.268
Playtex has not cracked that nut yet.

07:11.370 --> 07:12.502
But you know what?

07:12.571 --> 07:13.570
With a little creativity,

07:13.672 --> 07:14.971
you and I could get a pair of scissors

07:15.040 --> 07:16.406
and sort of create a new s...

07:16.508 --> 07:18.241
Uncle John, you can't
wear pads in a pool.

07:18.310 --> 07:19.343
Well, that's good to know.

07:19.411 --> 07:21.278
My period is not why
I don't want to do swimming.

07:21.347 --> 07:22.579
Then what's the problem?

07:22.648 --> 07:24.314
I hate putting on the swimsuit, okay?!

07:24.416 --> 07:26.583
All the other girls in my class
are like half my size,

07:26.652 --> 07:28.885
and it just makes me feel
self-conscious and gross and...

07:28.954 --> 07:29.986
Ugh!

07:30.122 --> 07:31.755
Please, can we just stop
talking about this?

07:31.857 --> 07:33.990
I'm sorry. I didn't realize
you felt this way.

07:34.059 --> 07:35.158
But that's crazy.

07:35.260 --> 07:36.760
You are perfect just the way you are.

07:36.862 --> 07:39.296
You're my uncle. You have to say that.

07:39.398 --> 07:42.766
But I know what I see
when I look in the mirror.

07:46.038 --> 07:49.269
I should not have used the
receipt to throw away my gum.

07:49.394 --> 07:51.714
<i>I had accidentally asked CB out
on a friend date,</i>

07:51.800 --> 07:54.152
<i>but the universe kept trying
to make it more romantic.</i>

07:54.230 --> 07:56.718
Again, I'm sorry the movie
"Babe" was sold out,

07:56.788 --> 07:58.888
but I thought "Eyes Wide Shut"
was an interesting film.

07:58.945 --> 08:00.148
Yeah, no pigs in that one.

08:00.241 --> 08:02.780
Some people live
really sexy lives, I guess.

08:02.843 --> 08:03.874
Good evening.

08:03.909 --> 08:06.143
Welcome to Bistro De L'Amore.

08:06.212 --> 08:08.781
Oh! <i>Je suis CB.</i>

08:08.847 --> 08:11.215
I'm sorry. Is this not
a TGI Fridays anymore?

08:11.250 --> 08:13.880
It was, then a Houlihan's and a Sbarro,

08:13.919 --> 08:15.986
then a laser-tag place,

08:16.021 --> 08:19.856
and now the most romantic
dining experience in Jenkintown.

08:19.959 --> 08:21.358
Mm. Of course it is.

08:21.427 --> 08:23.694
Seriously? Two people are
supposed to fit in there?

08:23.762 --> 08:25.062
Come on. Calm down.

08:25.164 --> 08:26.363
We... We can squeeze in.

08:26.465 --> 08:27.598
I may just stand.

08:27.700 --> 08:28.699
- Really?
- Yes.

08:28.801 --> 08:31.034
It is actually better
for your digestion.

08:31.103 --> 08:32.970
Your whole deal just lines right up.

08:33.072 --> 08:34.571
You know, you've been kind of
acting weird all day,

08:34.640 --> 08:35.739
and I think I know what it is.

08:35.841 --> 08:37.808
- You do?
- Yes.

08:37.909 --> 08:39.176
Please sit.

08:41.313 --> 08:43.013
Um, I think you know

08:43.082 --> 08:45.782
that I kind of maybe had a crush on you.

08:45.851 --> 08:46.883
Oh. Well...

08:46.952 --> 08:48.151
No, but it's okay.

08:48.254 --> 08:50.087
I'm moving on now, I got my own place,

08:50.155 --> 08:51.655
you and Barry are great together,

08:51.724 --> 08:54.725
and... it's all good between us, right?

08:54.827 --> 08:56.193
Yes. It's all good between us.

08:56.295 --> 08:58.362
Okay, good, 'cause
I really didn't want to

08:58.464 --> 08:59.730
ruin this friendship.

08:59.765 --> 09:02.232
I was dumb to think that I could
act normal and hide it,

09:02.301 --> 09:03.734
but y-you can't act normal.

09:03.836 --> 09:05.168
It's gonna affect your behavior.

09:05.237 --> 09:06.837
- Everyone knows that.
- Yeah.

09:06.939 --> 09:08.238
Everyone knows that.

09:08.340 --> 09:09.806
- It's science.
- Yes.

09:11.844 --> 09:13.277
So, I talked to my niece.

09:13.345 --> 09:14.378
You get her period all squared away?

09:14.446 --> 09:15.545
'Cause we're starting water polo,

09:15.614 --> 09:16.747
and I need gals with reach.

09:16.849 --> 09:18.248
Turns out it wasn't about that.

09:18.350 --> 09:19.283
She's at that age

09:19.385 --> 09:21.051
where she's uncomfortable with her body.

09:21.120 --> 09:22.152
She's really down.

09:22.221 --> 09:23.587
I've never seen her like this before.

09:23.656 --> 09:25.055
Time to do things my way,

09:25.124 --> 09:28.392
and that's to get her active,
get her endorphins flowing.

09:28.460 --> 09:30.294
Then she'll feel good
about her body again.

09:30.396 --> 09:31.595
I think this is a good idea,

09:31.664 --> 09:34.131
and I'm gonna join you
to support Felicia...

09:34.199 --> 09:36.166
and to tone up for my big debut

09:36.268 --> 09:38.101
as the host of "Singled Out"!

09:38.203 --> 09:39.236
Yeah, I'm still not playing.

09:39.338 --> 09:40.304
You sure about that?

09:40.372 --> 09:41.972
The winner receives a year's supply

09:42.041 --> 09:43.840
of feminine hygiene products.

09:43.942 --> 09:45.876
I'm not playing even more now.

09:47.146 --> 09:48.412
Circuit training? Really?

09:48.480 --> 09:50.580
18 stations of nonstop fun.

09:50.649 --> 09:51.915
I'm afraid so, Felicia.

09:52.017 --> 09:53.417
Coach Mellor's letting you do this

09:53.519 --> 09:54.618
to earn extra credit

09:54.720 --> 09:56.286
so that you don't fail PE.

09:56.355 --> 09:58.121
And I'm gonna do it with you.

09:58.223 --> 09:59.823
Let's rock and roll!

10:00.926 --> 10:02.192
Ab blasters!

10:03.996 --> 10:05.495
I should not have started the day

10:05.631 --> 10:06.897
with that crab cake omelet!

10:06.965 --> 10:09.232
- Ugh!
- Let's go, let's go! Crunch it up!

10:09.335 --> 10:10.967
Let's do some frog squats.

10:11.036 --> 10:12.044
Low.

10:12.145 --> 10:13.570
Kick it out. Bang!

10:15.074 --> 10:16.239
My God.

10:16.308 --> 10:18.208
Frogs must be in constant pain.

10:18.243 --> 10:20.644
Felicia, you work out like an
athlete at the top of her game,

10:20.713 --> 10:22.245
and I can say with authority

10:22.281 --> 10:25.048
that, physically, you have
nothing to be insecure about.

10:25.117 --> 10:26.650
Look forward to seeing you
at the pool tomorrow.

10:26.719 --> 10:28.334
You guys just don't get it.

10:28.397 --> 10:30.287
I know I'm fit,
but I still don't want to be seen

10:30.389 --> 10:31.655
in a bathing suit, okay?

10:31.757 --> 10:33.657
Why? Are people saying
mean things to you?

10:33.726 --> 10:34.758
They don't have to.

10:34.827 --> 10:37.160
I say enough mean things to myself.

10:37.262 --> 10:38.595
<i>That's when they realized</i>

10:38.664 --> 10:40.997
<i>sometimes body issues
aren't about the body at all.</i>

10:41.100 --> 10:42.032
So, what do we do now?

10:42.067 --> 10:45.435
Maybe something will come to me
while I'm throwing up.

10:45.471 --> 10:46.870
Wilma, you were right.

10:46.972 --> 10:48.472
I know. About what?

10:48.574 --> 10:50.073
About the brain's prefrontal cornhole.

10:50.175 --> 10:51.475
If something's in it,
you cannot hide it.

10:51.543 --> 10:53.510
That's cortex, and also, I told you so.

10:53.612 --> 10:55.412
Don't mess with science.

10:55.514 --> 10:56.980
So, you told CB you know?

10:57.015 --> 10:58.782
No. He thought I was acting weird

10:58.851 --> 11:01.084
because he was acting weird
when he was staying at my place

11:01.153 --> 11:03.453
because liking me was
in his prefrontal cortex.

11:03.522 --> 11:05.288
Anyway, it all came out.

11:05.357 --> 11:06.523
Wow, that must've been awkward.

11:06.592 --> 11:07.758
No, it was actually great.

11:07.860 --> 11:09.126
Ooh. Science twist.

11:09.161 --> 11:10.994
Once everything was out in the
open, we were able to relax

11:11.096 --> 11:12.781
- and enjoy a really nice dinner.
- Mm-hmm.

11:12.843 --> 11:14.965
We had a couple bottles of wine,
we laughed a ton.

11:15.067 --> 11:16.666
- Mm-hmm.
- We must've lost track of time,

11:16.702 --> 11:17.834
'cause next thing you knew,
it was 1:00 a.m.

11:17.903 --> 11:18.935
and they were kicking us out.

11:19.004 --> 11:20.537
Man, I haven't had fun
like that in a long time.

11:20.639 --> 11:21.705
Mm-hmm!

11:21.774 --> 11:22.939
Wait. Why was that "mm-hmm" different?

11:23.008 --> 11:24.441
- It wasn't different.
- Oh, it was different.

11:24.476 --> 11:25.742
Look, I don't know what you're implying,

11:25.844 --> 11:26.843
but you can just drop it,

11:26.912 --> 11:28.211
'cause things are good
and back to normal.

11:28.247 --> 11:29.212
Are they, though?

11:29.281 --> 11:31.314
Yes! CB and I are back to being friends.

11:31.417 --> 11:32.883
- Are you, though?
- Of course.

11:32.951 --> 11:35.652
- And Barry is clearly the one for me.
- Is he, though?

11:35.721 --> 11:38.054
Just say what you're implying
with your vague questions.

11:38.123 --> 11:40.123
All I'm saying is Barry lives far away

11:40.192 --> 11:41.324
and you hardly ever see each other.

11:41.393 --> 11:43.160
I'm not questioning how you feel,

11:43.262 --> 11:45.061
but a long-distance situation

11:45.130 --> 11:47.431
can make it tough
for a relationship to grow.

11:47.499 --> 11:50.901
Is it possible it might be
holding you back?

11:50.969 --> 11:52.669
- From what, being with CB?
- Maybe.

11:52.704 --> 11:55.338
Or maybe just from exploring
and experiencing things

11:55.474 --> 11:56.807
that are right here in the present.

11:56.875 --> 11:58.241
- Why are you doing this?
- Doing what?

11:58.310 --> 11:59.509
You asked me to say things.

11:59.611 --> 12:01.578
Yeah, but I meant different things!

12:02.848 --> 12:05.515
First I got to be in
the dumb game show, now this.

12:05.584 --> 12:07.384
<i>Determined to make Felicia feel better,</i>

12:07.419 --> 12:09.319
<i>Glascott came up with
a plan to show Felicia</i>

12:09.421 --> 12:11.588
<i>she wasn't the only one
with insecurities.</i>

12:11.657 --> 12:14.224
Oh, Felicia.
Fancy running into you here.

12:14.293 --> 12:15.926
In the cafeteria at lunchtime,

12:16.028 --> 12:17.461
where all students are required to be?

12:17.563 --> 12:19.224
Someone's been reading
the student handbook.

12:20.532 --> 12:22.799
Anyhoo, Coop was just telling me

12:22.868 --> 12:24.601
he's insecure because he can't read.

12:24.670 --> 12:26.870
No, I-I said I was an early reader.

12:26.972 --> 12:28.905
And the kids, they would call me

12:29.007 --> 12:31.942
- very hurtful, hurtful names...
- Mm. Mm.

12:31.977 --> 12:34.537
- ...bookworm, Poindexter...
- Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

12:34.615 --> 12:35.779
...Literate Larry.

12:35.814 --> 12:38.215
Point is, it made you feel
so bad, you learned how to read.

12:38.283 --> 12:39.549
Come on, man. I ju...

12:39.618 --> 12:40.650
I'm sorry.

12:40.752 --> 12:42.552
Is this a conversation
about feeling bad?

12:42.621 --> 12:43.854
Why, yes, it is, CB.

12:43.922 --> 12:46.122
Do you, by chance, have anything to add?

12:46.191 --> 12:47.624
Do I ever.

12:47.659 --> 12:49.559
I'd love to talk to someone
about my weird ankles.

12:49.661 --> 12:50.994
They make me feel less than.

12:51.096 --> 12:52.028
- Ohh.
- You know?

12:52.130 --> 12:53.063
People are always saying,

12:53.131 --> 12:54.598
"CB, your ankles are perfectly fine,"

12:54.700 --> 12:56.500
- but that's not how I see it.
- Mm-hmm.

12:56.568 --> 12:58.502
It's the great shame
at the end of my legs.

12:58.570 --> 12:59.936
I know what you're doing, Uncle J.

13:00.005 --> 13:01.938
We talking body-confidence
issues over here?

13:02.040 --> 13:03.273
Hold on. Not yet.

13:03.342 --> 13:05.141
I'm not doing anything.

13:05.244 --> 13:06.343
All right, go on.

13:06.411 --> 13:08.912
Are we talking body-confidence
issues over here?

13:09.014 --> 13:10.614
Wait, you can't tell me Rick Mellor

13:10.682 --> 13:12.482
has body-confidence issues.

13:12.551 --> 13:15.085
Do I ever. Where do I even start?

13:15.187 --> 13:16.820
Head, shoulders, knees, toes?

13:16.922 --> 13:18.188
You're just doing the song.

13:18.223 --> 13:20.590
But, Rick, I think that your
head, shoulder, knees and toes,

13:20.659 --> 13:22.492
- knees and toes are just beautiful.
- Ugh.

13:22.594 --> 13:23.727
What the hell is going on?

13:23.795 --> 13:25.762
It's just good to know that
we all have insecurities.

13:25.864 --> 13:27.097
Yeah, so you don't have to feel bad

13:27.199 --> 13:28.999
- about wearing a bathing suit.
- Oh, my God!

13:29.101 --> 13:30.300
Did you tell the whole school?

13:30.369 --> 13:32.536
- No, just all your teachers.
- Just us.

13:32.638 --> 13:34.337
I am already embarrassed about this,

13:34.439 --> 13:35.605
and now I feel even more ashamed

13:35.707 --> 13:37.741
because everybody knows
my personal business.

13:37.843 --> 13:39.209
Thanks a lot!

13:39.311 --> 13:42.112
Felicia, wait.

13:42.180 --> 13:43.880
Felicia, please, let's talk.

13:43.982 --> 13:45.448
No, I'm done, Uncle John.

13:45.517 --> 13:47.017
Just stop trying to fix this.

13:47.119 --> 13:49.052
You don't get it, and you never will.

13:54.960 --> 13:56.326
<i>Glascott finally realized</i>

13:56.428 --> 13:57.861
<i>it wasn't that anybody could tell her</i>

13:57.930 --> 13:59.195
<i>to feel good about herself,</i>

13:59.298 --> 14:00.463
<i>because everywhere she looked,</i>

14:00.566 --> 14:02.999
<i>society was telling her she shouldn't.</i>

14:03.669 --> 14:04.964
<i>It was Valentine's Day,</i>

14:04.988 --> 14:06.682
<i>the day of the big "Singled Out" game.</i>

14:06.745 --> 14:08.377
<i>Barry had made his way
down from Detroit,</i>

14:08.464 --> 14:10.364
<i>and I had a plan to prove Wilma wrong.</i>

14:10.462 --> 14:12.662
Hey, I want to be the girl
contestant for "Singled Out."

14:12.753 --> 14:14.687
- Done. I'm free!
- And you'll be Jenny McCarthy.

14:14.747 --> 14:16.947
Oh, still not great,
but better than before.

14:17.050 --> 14:18.149
Why the sudden change?

14:18.217 --> 14:19.750
Well, "Singled Out"
takes a big group of guys

14:19.819 --> 14:21.285
and narrows them down
to reveal who's right for you,

14:21.354 --> 14:23.454
and I'm gonna prove to you
that the last man standing

14:23.523 --> 14:25.189
- will be Barry Goldberg.
- Mm-hmm.

14:25.258 --> 14:27.291
I'm not doing the "mm-hmm"
thing again. Just say it.

14:27.360 --> 14:28.926
Well, I don't think you're
trying to prove anything to me.

14:28.995 --> 14:30.961
I think you're trying
to prove it to yourself.

14:35.635 --> 14:37.635
This is gonna be awesome.

14:37.704 --> 14:39.637
It was always my destiny to be on MTV.

14:39.706 --> 14:42.473
I figured it'd be as a rapper,
but this is a close second.

14:42.575 --> 14:43.861
Again, this is not on TV.

14:43.926 --> 14:45.292
That's why I love you.

14:45.361 --> 14:46.427
You keep me grounded.

14:46.496 --> 14:47.762
Oh, hey, there's been a change.

14:47.830 --> 14:49.363
I'm gonna be the bachelorette
for "Singled Out."

14:49.432 --> 14:52.066
Oh, sweet! There's no way I can lose!

14:52.135 --> 14:54.635
I know all the desires
of my Lainey-love's heart.

14:54.737 --> 14:55.736
Damn right you do.

14:55.838 --> 14:57.071
I'm gonna go psych out the competition,

14:57.140 --> 14:58.472
get inside their heads.

14:58.541 --> 14:59.607
Hey, dummies.

14:59.709 --> 15:00.741
You all look dumb.

15:07.617 --> 15:10.151
Welcome to the first-ever

15:10.253 --> 15:13.788
William Penn Valentine's Day
edition of "Singled Out."

15:14.991 --> 15:16.924
"And now please welcome the man

15:16.993 --> 15:19.994
who put the 'prince'
and the 'pal' in 'principal'"...

15:20.062 --> 15:21.796
Oh, God, I should've just stayed
the contestant.

15:21.898 --> 15:23.264
...John Glascott.

15:24.467 --> 15:26.500
Yeah! Thank you!

15:26.602 --> 15:28.302
I'm so happy to be here.

15:28.404 --> 15:30.404
Now let's meet our lucky lady.

15:30.473 --> 15:32.206
Or should I say lucky Lainey?

15:32.308 --> 15:33.774
John, come on.

15:33.843 --> 15:35.743
It's our very own Lainey Lewis!

15:41.150 --> 15:42.216
Okay, Wilma.

15:42.285 --> 15:44.084
Please tell everyone how the game works.

15:44.153 --> 15:45.252
- If I have to.
- You do.

15:45.354 --> 15:46.375
Sure.

15:46.445 --> 15:49.123
Principal Glascott will give
Lainey a series of choices,

15:49.192 --> 15:51.592
and the guys whose answers
don't match up with Lainey's

15:51.648 --> 15:52.648
get the boot,

15:52.695 --> 15:54.328
until there's only one left.

15:54.397 --> 15:56.597
We all know who that's gonna be.

15:56.666 --> 15:58.432
All right, Lainey. First choice.

15:58.501 --> 16:01.368
Skiing on the mountain
or sunning on the beach?

16:01.471 --> 16:02.703
Sunshine all day, John.

16:02.772 --> 16:03.971
All right, guys. Let's see 'em.

16:05.074 --> 16:08.446
Oh. All you mountain men,
it's time to take a hike.

16:11.881 --> 16:13.180
Oh, come on, Rick.

16:13.282 --> 16:15.182
To me, Nurse Julie is the answer
to all the questions.

16:15.318 --> 16:17.685
Yeah, says the loser
who's just been booted.

16:17.753 --> 16:19.787
Also, you're a good man
and a friend through the years.

16:19.889 --> 16:21.822
Okay, that was a mess.

16:21.924 --> 16:23.991
But back to our game.

16:24.060 --> 16:26.594
Lainey, scary movie or rom-com?

16:26.696 --> 16:28.028
Rom-com all the way.

16:29.966 --> 16:32.104
You guys suck at knowing
personal information

16:32.135 --> 16:33.200
about my girlfriend.

16:33.269 --> 16:35.636
<i>And this process repeated
again and again.</i>

16:35.738 --> 16:37.071
Italian or Chinese?

16:37.139 --> 16:38.672
Italian.

16:38.741 --> 16:40.374
- Sweet.
- Sweet, baby.

16:40.476 --> 16:41.675
Massage.

16:41.744 --> 16:43.577
<i>12 questions later, it was down to Barry</i>

16:43.646 --> 16:45.179
<i>and... wouldn't you know it? CB.</i>

16:45.248 --> 16:47.381
<i>Now one question would decide it all.</i>

16:47.450 --> 16:50.317
Mr. Serious or big ol' goofball?

16:50.419 --> 16:52.052
Goofball.

16:52.121 --> 16:54.755
<i>Okay. One more question.</i>

16:54.790 --> 16:55.956
Dogs or cats?

16:56.025 --> 16:57.057
Cats.

16:58.494 --> 17:00.960
<i>Okay. It was a lot more questions.</i>

17:01.069 --> 17:02.596
Boxers.

17:02.698 --> 17:04.265
- Chevrolet.
- Vroom!

17:04.333 --> 17:06.300
Chocolate milk.

17:06.402 --> 17:08.669
Well, um, I'm afraid that's it.

17:08.738 --> 17:10.738
What?! That can't be it.
There's still two guys left.

17:10.806 --> 17:12.873
Well, that's all the cards we have.

17:12.974 --> 17:14.040
For the first time

17:14.109 --> 17:16.377
in the first-ever
William Penn "Singled Out,"

17:16.479 --> 17:18.045
we have a tie!

17:18.146 --> 17:19.547
Tie? There can't be a tie!

17:19.648 --> 17:21.248
There needs to be a clear winner.

17:21.349 --> 17:22.249
And there will be!

17:23.986 --> 17:26.353
1, 2, 3, 4.

17:26.454 --> 17:27.988
I declare a thumb war.

17:28.089 --> 17:29.089
Come on, come on.

17:29.191 --> 17:30.858
Yes. Ohh, 1, 2, 3.

17:30.960 --> 17:32.326
Yes! Whoo!

17:32.395 --> 17:34.128
Big Tasty for the win!

17:34.196 --> 17:35.496
- Yes!
- Whoo!

17:35.598 --> 17:37.264
That was a lot of fun, Barry.

17:37.366 --> 17:39.133
Thank you so much for coming into town.

17:39.235 --> 17:40.534
Victory lap!

17:48.210 --> 17:50.411
Hey. Where you going?

17:50.513 --> 17:51.645
Oh, I just need a little air.

17:51.714 --> 17:53.948
- Well, you must be feeling pretty good.
- Why?

17:53.983 --> 17:55.282
You proved what you wanted to prove.

17:55.351 --> 17:56.517
I don't know if I did.

17:56.586 --> 17:58.419
- What do you mean? Barry won.
- Did he, though?

17:58.487 --> 18:00.955
<i>The "Singled Out" game had left
me more confused than ever.</i>

18:01.023 --> 18:03.791
<i>As for Glascott, he finally
understood Felicia's issue.</i>

18:03.893 --> 18:05.326
Mind if I have a seat?

18:09.031 --> 18:10.197
Look, it was...

18:10.299 --> 18:12.700
it was wrong for me
to try and "fix" you.

18:12.768 --> 18:14.602
I'm really sorry about that.

18:14.704 --> 18:16.070
Well, I guess it was
just you trying to help

18:16.172 --> 18:17.538
in your own stupid way.

18:17.607 --> 18:19.273
The truth is, you don't need fixing.

18:19.342 --> 18:21.308
You're perfect just the way you are.

18:21.410 --> 18:22.643
I really mean it.

18:22.712 --> 18:24.945
And I'm not saying that
just because I'm your uncle.

18:25.014 --> 18:26.313
I appreciate it.

18:26.382 --> 18:28.582
It's just, you have
no idea what it's like

18:28.651 --> 18:30.951
to be a teenage girl and have
to deal with all this stuff.

18:31.053 --> 18:32.786
You're right. I don't.

18:32.855 --> 18:35.356
But I do know what
it's like to be an uncle

18:35.424 --> 18:36.857
who would do anything to help his niece

18:36.959 --> 18:37.958
when she's hurting.

18:40.096 --> 18:43.197
Would you let me try
one more stupid thing to help?

18:46.235 --> 18:47.434
Go ahead. Open it.

19:03.152 --> 19:06.387
that showed how you wanted
the world to see you.

19:06.489 --> 19:08.522
I'm showing you how the world
does see you...

19:08.591 --> 19:11.892

19:11.994 --> 19:15.195

19:15.297 --> 19:17.464
- That was a really cool day.

19:17.566 --> 19:19.466
The first female football player

19:19.568 --> 19:21.635
in the history of William Penn?

19:21.737 --> 19:23.337
That was the best day.

19:23.439 --> 19:25.639
You know, maybe I'm not giving
my body enough credit.

19:25.708 --> 19:28.575
I mean, it has got me some
pretty incredible things.

19:28.678 --> 19:30.044
It really has.

19:30.112 --> 19:31.845

John, took a lot of convincing,
but I know you're totally

20:21.157 --> 20:23.490
- on board with this.
- I am not on board with this.

20:23.600 --> 20:24.826
Let's rock 'n' roll!

20:26.296 --> 20:28.062
Come on. Give me three more. Let's go!

20:28.164 --> 20:30.222
I hate you.

20:30.323 --> 20:31.966
I hate you.

20:32.068 --> 20:33.417
- I hate you.
- Yeah.

20:33.527 --> 20:35.206
Come on. Let's twist. Use your obliques.

20:35.329 --> 20:36.830
I don't want to twist anymore.

20:36.947 --> 20:38.331
Stop passing me the ball.

20:39.246 --> 20:40.983
Please keep it.

20:41.116 --> 20:43.085
You're not listening to me.

20:43.217 --> 20:45.344
This is how friendships fall apart.

20:45.469 --> 20:47.088
Keep going. Feel the burn.

20:47.223 --> 20:49.008
What's the point, Rick?

20:49.890 --> 20:52.040
What's the [bleep] point?

20:52.157 --> 20:54.015
All right. Good work, John.

20:54.062 --> 20:55.101
Same time tomorrow?

20:55.187 --> 20:56.414
I'll be here,

20:56.562 --> 20:58.960
