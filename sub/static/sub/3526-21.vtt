<i>New York's
classic rock q104.3.</i>

02:06.285 --> 02:07.786
<i>Good morning.
I'm jim kerr.</i>

02:07.854 --> 02:09.454
<i>Coming up a little
bit later on the "q"...</i>

02:26.472 --> 02:28.106
Half an hour,
he says.

02:28.207 --> 02:30.042
It's a fucking hour
and a half already.

02:30.209 --> 02:32.044
He's busy.

02:32.211 --> 02:34.212
Enjoy the music.

03:07.747 --> 03:09.648
I thought
you weren't coming.

03:09.749 --> 03:11.650
<i>You don't wanna know.</i>

03:11.756 --> 03:13.810
Actually, I do.

03:15.651 --> 03:17.588
We had intel

03:17.654 --> 03:19.591
A salafist cell
was at Newark airport

03:19.659 --> 03:22.160
Boarding somebody
onto a 767 to London.

03:22.199 --> 03:24.593
You're right.
I don't wanna know.

03:24.665 --> 03:27.230
We get this all the time.
Our source was either wrong

03:27.368 --> 03:29.233
Or it was done
to study our response.

03:29.365 --> 03:31.232
Happens all the time?

03:31.278 --> 03:33.602
What's up, my ?

03:33.607 --> 03:35.970
You know, my kid is
obsessed with this shit.

03:36.008 --> 03:38.071
But we tell him he's making
a molehill out of it.

03:38.118 --> 03:41.270
<i>Is he right?</i>

03:45.556 --> 03:48.182
Hey.
Probably another hour.

03:48.287 --> 03:50.950
Just leave it out,

03:51.027 --> 03:52.950
All right?
I'll heat it up.

03:52.956 --> 03:55.193
Well, then don't
leave it out.

03:57.496 --> 03:59.133
What do you
want me to say?

04:04.038 --> 04:06.601
You got a rough enough job
with this terrorism shit.

04:06.736 --> 04:10.240
I'll let you get home. The
reason I called is those two arabs

04:10.378 --> 04:12.671
I turned you on to-- Well,
I happened to remember

04:12.745 --> 04:14.411
My nephew
mentioned a bank

04:14.515 --> 04:16.612
<i>Where they had
an account--</i>

04:16.748 --> 04:18.653
A branch...

04:22.325 --> 04:24.990
The mintner first
merchants bank.

04:25.156 --> 04:27.422
- You just remembered that?
- Yeah.

04:27.525 --> 04:28.963
Thanks.

04:28.998 --> 04:32.160
Oh, whoa--
Listen,

04:32.336 --> 04:35.333
I know you got that friend
in the Brooklyn office.

04:35.406 --> 04:37.800
Is it possible he knows
where Phil Leotardo is?

04:37.837 --> 04:40.703
I want to try to avoid any
more of my guys getting hurt.

04:40.746 --> 04:43.343
I'm just saying,

04:43.347 --> 04:45.713
If you heard anything
from your pal--

04:45.846 --> 04:48.180
I haven't.

04:48.185 --> 04:51.280
I figured maybe money's
sent to the middle east.

04:51.356 --> 04:52.950
You're overreaching.

05:11.376 --> 05:13.470
Okay.

05:41.638 --> 05:43.900
- See you Thursday.
- Bye.

05:44.075 --> 05:45.803
Where are you going?
I just got here.

05:45.908 --> 05:48.542
I'm really late meeting
patrick in the city. Bye.

05:48.677 --> 05:50.470
Bye-Bye.

05:56.588 --> 05:58.583
How are you doing?

06:00.256 --> 06:02.250
She smelled
that odor too.

06:04.925 --> 06:06.893
Your remodel
will fix all that.

06:06.925 --> 06:09.662
Maybe it's toxic. Maybe we
shouldn't be breathing it.

06:09.795 --> 06:11.662
It's not toxic.
The owners were, what,

06:11.767 --> 06:14.263
90 years old?
It's piss.

06:14.367 --> 06:18.273
I got to get home.

06:19.276 --> 06:21.502
I'm working on it.

06:24.016 --> 06:26.073
I went to see Sil...

06:26.115 --> 06:29.110
And Gab.
Oh my God, Tony.

06:29.218 --> 06:31.780
Yeah.

06:33.215 --> 06:36.050
<i>Are you being careful?</i>

06:39.556 --> 06:41.191
This kind of
bothers me.

06:41.295 --> 06:42.690
Call me when you
get home, okay?

06:42.797 --> 06:44.690
Okay.
Thanks.

06:44.796 --> 06:47.460
Who is she
gonna tell?

06:48.808 --> 06:50.802
But you should used
the back door.

06:55.245 --> 06:57.743
I wouldn't kick her out
of bed for purging cookies.

06:57.917 --> 07:01.410
Real funny.
We're just friends.

07:01.486 --> 07:03.813
I know.
Nice work.

07:03.886 --> 07:06.210
<i>- She's a model.
- She's doing some modeling.</i>

07:06.317 --> 07:08.322
All right? She's a
Junior in high school.

07:08.325 --> 07:09.651
What?

07:09.726 --> 07:11.722
She's quitting modeling
anyway.

07:11.827 --> 07:13.550
<i>She's tired
of being exploited.</i>

07:13.655 --> 07:15.720
Did you help your mother
take the carpets outside,

07:15.826 --> 07:18.330
- Put 'em in the sun?
- He did.

07:20.235 --> 07:21.762
Uncle Bobby's funeral
is finally set

07:21.838 --> 07:24.562
For Thursday.
And you're gonna be there.

07:24.677 --> 07:26.301
How's that
supposed to work?

07:26.335 --> 07:29.702
We're all on def-Con 4,
living in separate houses

07:29.848 --> 07:32.011
<i>And we're gonna stand out
in the open at the cemetery?</i>

07:32.016 --> 07:34.340
There is always
a large FBI presence.

07:36.118 --> 07:38.113
Unbelievable.

07:40.688 --> 07:43.550
He was different, you know?
We forget.

07:43.626 --> 07:45.523
When he was
with blanca.

07:45.628 --> 07:48.190
<i>Pwe commend to
almighty God our brother robert</i>

07:48.296 --> 07:50.362
<i>And we commit his body
to its resting place...</i>

07:50.435 --> 07:52.733
The ceremony
just ended.

07:54.735 --> 07:56.461
...The lord
bless him and keep him.

07:56.566 --> 07:58.370
The lord make his face
shine upon him...

08:00.348 --> 08:02.743
<i>every one of these
things is lemon chicken or fish.</i>

08:02.777 --> 08:05.210
<i>- Look at that.
- Can I have some sauce?</i>

08:07.987 --> 08:11.213
<i>- I heard cauliflower's $3.99 a pound.
- I'm not gonna have this.</i>

08:11.385 --> 08:13.382
Can you believe that?

08:18.627 --> 08:20.652
Oh, pop, they got
roast pork.

08:22.326 --> 08:23.992
Give me one.
Thanks.

08:29.568 --> 08:32.000
- She had won "American idol."
- No.

08:32.105 --> 08:33.370
Jennifer hudson?
Absolutely.

08:33.405 --> 08:35.673
Jason g. Was the winner
of Italian "American idol."

08:35.745 --> 08:37.741
He could say "fuck"
more times in a sentence

08:37.845 --> 08:40.071
Than any other contestant.

08:40.177 --> 08:42.082
Uncle Paulie,
come sit down.

08:42.186 --> 08:44.482
Yeah, I'll sit with you.
I'm young at heart, right?

08:47.587 --> 08:49.753
Who are you, dear?

08:49.857 --> 08:52.090
Tara Zincone.
Bobby's niece.

08:53.155 --> 08:56.293
My condolences.

08:59.168 --> 09:01.432
Oh...

09:01.507 --> 09:03.101
<i>- did I eat.
- It was good.</i>

09:03.167 --> 09:05.433
In the midst of death,
we are in life.

09:05.538 --> 09:07.331
<i>Or is it the other way
around?</i>

09:07.476 --> 09:08.801
I think it's
the other way around.

09:08.877 --> 09:11.810
Either version, you're
halfway up the ass.

09:11.847 --> 09:14.411
Pardon my French,
sweetheart.

09:14.486 --> 09:16.983
- I've lost two dear friends.
- Sil's hanging on.

09:17.056 --> 09:19.253
I lost ma
last month.

09:19.386 --> 09:21.620
You can take 2007 and give
it back to the indians.

09:21.685 --> 09:24.222
- I'm sorry.
- What are you gonna do?

09:24.298 --> 09:27.692
<i>Life goes on.</i>

09:30.296 --> 09:32.630
We were discussing
"dreamgirls." Did you see it?

09:32.696 --> 09:35.632
You people are fucked.
You're living in a dream.

09:35.805 --> 09:38.533
You still sit here talking
about the fucking Oscars?

09:38.637 --> 09:41.641
"What rough beast slouches
toward bethlehem to be born?"

09:41.747 --> 09:44.040
- Huh?
- "Yeets."

09:44.176 --> 09:47.311
- A.J.
- Yeats?

09:47.415 --> 09:49.913
The world--
Don't you see it?

09:52.656 --> 09:54.150
Bush let
Al Qaeda escape...

09:54.226 --> 09:55.752
<i>- ho!
- ...In the mountains.</i>

09:55.857 --> 09:57.482
Then he has us invade
some other country.

09:57.597 --> 10:00.422
Let's join up, go kill
some fucking terrorists.

10:00.566 --> 10:03.092
It's more noble than watching
these Jack-Off fantasies on TV

10:03.226 --> 10:05.631
Of how we're
kicking their ass.

10:09.767 --> 10:12.302
It's like, America--

10:12.407 --> 10:15.071
<i>- What about it?
- This is still where people come</i>

10:15.177 --> 10:17.970
To make it.
It's a beautiful idea.

10:18.046 --> 10:20.342
And then what
do they get? Bling?

10:20.448 --> 10:22.782
<i>And come-Ons for shit they
don't need and can't afford?</i>

10:22.886 --> 10:25.551
You're all over the place. I don't
know what you're trying to say.

10:25.687 --> 10:28.182
He's saying the framus
intersects with ramistan

10:28.225 --> 10:30.180
Approximately
at the paternoster.

10:32.295 --> 10:33.991
Julius, what do I
have to do?

10:34.066 --> 10:36.393
What do I have to say
to get you out of here?

10:36.468 --> 10:40.193
<i>Give me a chance.
Give me first dibs at this--</i>

10:40.267 --> 10:42.960
This television series
thing, or whatever it is.

10:43.061 --> 10:44.978
Let me do the
pilot, please.

10:45.074 --> 10:48.741
Julius, my boy,
sit down.

10:48.779 --> 10:50.740
Julius, I'm not a hard man.
I'm not a mean man...

10:50.819 --> 10:52.613
Tell you right now,
it's light.

10:52.646 --> 10:55.411
...But the television industry
today is looking for talent.

10:55.486 --> 10:57.240
They're looking
for quality.

10:57.285 --> 10:59.781
They're preoccupied
with talent and quality,

10:59.917 --> 11:01.823
And a writer is
a major commodity.

11:01.927 --> 11:03.851
You know, this situation
ain't all bad.

11:03.956 --> 11:06.320
I haven't had a green
vegetable in over a week.

11:06.428 --> 11:08.321
We can't even go down
to the pork store?

11:08.428 --> 11:11.562
- We gotta hang around here all day doing nothing.
- Baciagalup.

11:14.267 --> 11:17.330
<i>- Who does he belong to?
- He just showed up during the big storm.</i>

11:17.436 --> 11:19.400
Already caught a mouse
down the cellar.

11:19.505 --> 11:22.143
A lot of my customers giving
their action to New York.

11:22.246 --> 11:25.743
Power vacuum,
they're taking advantage.

11:28.747 --> 11:30.142
Oh.

11:30.247 --> 11:33.750
- The fuck you come in that way for?
- Sorry.

11:37.355 --> 11:39.592
We're gonna meet Paulie
down at the hospital,

11:39.695 --> 11:42.463
Visit Sil.
You wanna come?

11:42.527 --> 11:45.791
Nah, I got...

11:45.937 --> 11:48.931
Shit I gotta do.
My daughter...

11:48.968 --> 11:51.703
<i>...Scratching
plaintively on a closed door.</i>

11:51.806 --> 11:54.702
<i>Mr. Julius moomer,
a would-Be writer...</i>

11:54.808 --> 11:57.001
Yesterday it was
his gout.

11:59.377 --> 12:01.480
This is New York's
famous little Italy.

12:01.545 --> 12:03.482
It once covered over
40 square blocks

12:03.616 --> 12:07.650
<i>But has now been reduced to
one row of shops and cafes.</i>

12:11.796 --> 12:13.653
Hello.

12:13.797 --> 12:15.690
<i>It's me.</i>

12:15.798 --> 12:17.722
Where are you?
Are you close?

12:17.796 --> 12:20.131
<i>Let's do it
over the phone.</i>

12:22.208 --> 12:24.063
No word yet.

12:24.176 --> 12:26.133
No one knows
where our friend is.

12:26.205 --> 12:29.002
<i>It's not that there's no word,
it's that there's no progress.</i>

12:29.078 --> 12:31.141
Nobody's taking
this lightly, Phil.

12:31.245 --> 12:32.871
He should have been
done first.

12:32.975 --> 12:35.183
They thought they'd find
them both at the strip joint.

12:35.315 --> 12:36.580
I've heard this
already.

12:36.718 --> 12:39.010
I know you're
disappointed, Phil.

12:39.088 --> 12:40.880
I can hear it
in everything you say.

12:40.986 --> 12:42.652
Fuckin'-A
I'm disappointed.

12:42.726 --> 12:44.850
<i>I'm thinking.</i>

12:44.925 --> 12:47.193
- Come on in, check it out.
- I don't know.

12:47.266 --> 12:49.221
<i>- Maybe...
- What?</i>

12:49.325 --> 12:51.022
<i>Are you talking
about reaching out?</i>

12:51.166 --> 12:53.693
We can't go back. Are you
out of your fucking mi?

12:53.765 --> 12:56.431
- No, I know.
- Then what did you say it for?

12:56.608 --> 12:58.330
I didn't, Phil.
You did.

12:58.437 --> 13:00.370
Listen, kid,

13:00.447 --> 13:02.771
When this is over
we're gonna sit down,

13:02.907 --> 13:05.112
<i>- Me and you.
- I hope so.</i>

13:05.216 --> 13:08.112
I can't hear you.
You're breaking up.

13:08.216 --> 13:10.043
<i>I said I hope--</i>

13:44.816 --> 13:47.810
"Ferrara's."

13:47.926 --> 13:50.822
- Want a pastry?
- I need to watch my weight.

13:50.925 --> 13:53.452
I need to snag
another husband.

13:57.335 --> 13:59.430
You're the only one
who realized that's a joke.

13:59.495 --> 14:01.131
You had to grow up
in our family.

14:01.265 --> 14:03.930
That dig you made about me giving
guys head under the boardwalk?

14:04.078 --> 14:06.172
He took it so seriously,
Bobby.

14:16.116 --> 14:18.782
Anyway,

14:18.855 --> 14:20.981
Thank you
for being here.

14:23.956 --> 14:25.953
So what happens now?

14:27.668 --> 14:30.523
Well, robert's already said he
wants to go live with his aunt.

14:30.637 --> 14:33.631
- What about sophia?
- Nica is my daughter.

14:33.708 --> 14:36.662
She's very much
into her older sister.

14:36.707 --> 14:39.670
Sophia's out of her mind if she
thinks she's getting out of this house.

14:39.806 --> 14:43.472
Is that a joke? 'Cause
that one even got by me.

14:54.557 --> 14:56.120
You know,
five, six years ago

14:56.226 --> 14:59.090
<i>When Johnny Sack
bought this house,</i>

14:59.198 --> 15:01.421
This was all
cornfields here.

15:01.528 --> 15:05.792
I'd like to give it
a shot with Bobby's kids.

15:05.838 --> 15:08.632
Bobby would want it.

15:10.008 --> 15:11.973
I put in a lot of effort
with sophia--

15:12.036 --> 15:15.070
Baking together... I think
we actually have a bond.

15:17.215 --> 15:20.410
I've had therapy.
I'm a good mother.

15:20.547 --> 15:22.580
I put ma and all her
warped shit behind me.

15:22.718 --> 15:24.312
Good.

15:24.487 --> 15:26.210
Not that I get
any thanks for it.

15:28.157 --> 15:31.492
You know you could form
a new nuclear family.

15:32.898 --> 15:35.761
You bring
harpo down here...

15:35.928 --> 15:37.820
It's a big place.

15:37.938 --> 15:40.331
Harpo changed
his name.

15:40.408 --> 15:42.402
He's hal now.

15:44.837 --> 15:46.603
Janice...

15:49.947 --> 15:52.612
Well, you need anything,
you know I'm minutes away.

16:03.125 --> 16:05.521
<i>- Yeah.
- Multiple calls</i>

16:05.598 --> 16:08.263
Traced back to a payphone
in oyster bay, long island.

16:08.368 --> 16:10.923
What?
Oh. Oh, uh...

16:12.537 --> 16:15.101
- where's the phone at exactly?
- Gas station, most likely.

16:15.206 --> 16:16.532
<i>- Gas station?
- He's lammed out.</i>

16:16.608 --> 16:18.901
He may not be able to put his
hands on a clean cell phone.

16:18.935 --> 16:20.903
<i>All right, listen,
thanks. Really--</i>

16:20.948 --> 16:22.143
All right.

17:06.954 --> 17:09.621
You kept telling me
this guy is good.

17:11.025 --> 17:12.892
It's amazing it was written so long ago.

17:13.027 --> 17:15.321
It's, like,
about right now.

17:29.777 --> 17:31.512
This could be
a mistake.

17:31.618 --> 17:33.511
I know.

17:33.646 --> 17:35.443
We're good friends.

17:35.607 --> 17:37.611
Yeah.

18:00.705 --> 18:02.701
Oh, wait.

18:29.406 --> 18:30.701
Holy shit.

18:30.837 --> 18:32.873
Oh my God.

18:32.936 --> 18:34.870
Go!

18:45.186 --> 18:47.511
Oh, Christ.
I parked in leaves!

18:59.968 --> 19:02.262
Wow.

19:02.368 --> 19:04.530
At least my gas tank
was practically empty.

19:16.747 --> 19:18.852
How many fucking times
have I told you:

19:18.917 --> 19:21.423
It's an S.U.V., watch
where you park off-Road?

19:21.557 --> 19:24.620
The catalytic converter
and the dry vegetation!

19:24.756 --> 19:27.421
I didn't see
the leaves.

19:27.565 --> 19:29.560
<i>You can grill fucking
steaks on that converter!</i>

19:29.726 --> 19:31.091
I told you!

19:31.268 --> 19:33.790
If there was children
playing in those leaves,

19:33.935 --> 19:36.632
- You'd have run them over?
- I guess.

19:36.735 --> 19:38.701
Oh, you're gonna
get cute now?

19:38.806 --> 19:41.702
- I was just answering her question.
- Dad, he wasn't being funny.

19:41.805 --> 19:44.943
You mind your own goddamn business
unless you want some of this too.

19:47.347 --> 19:49.913
<i>- Mr. Fat mouth.
- What did you say?</i>

19:55.985 --> 19:58.821
<i>- What was going
through your mind?</i>

19:58.928 --> 20:01.792
What do you want from me?
I am depressed.

20:01.928 --> 20:04.192
I'm supposed to go around
looking for piles of leaves?

20:04.296 --> 20:06.991
Wanna hear depressed?
$30,000 for that car.

20:07.106 --> 20:09.463
Isn't that what
you have insurance for?

20:09.538 --> 20:11.800
Excuse me? You're not
getting another one.

20:13.948 --> 20:16.700
Actually, that's good.

20:16.806 --> 20:18.711
It'll force me
to take the bus.

20:18.816 --> 20:20.172
What?

20:20.318 --> 20:22.341
We have to break our
dependence on foreign oil.

20:31.195 --> 20:34.320
<i>- Cafe Napoli.
- George, it's Anthony.</i>

20:34.368 --> 20:36.423
<i>Your fucking
ears must be ringing.</i>

20:36.525 --> 20:38.832
<i>I just left your friend,
the son, crying the blues</i>

20:38.997 --> 20:41.563
<i>Over the situation between
you and that outfit over there.</i>

20:41.665 --> 20:43.532
<i>That's why I'm calling.</i>

20:43.678 --> 20:45.830
<i>I need you to reach out
to the little guy.</i>

20:45.907 --> 20:48.672
<i>He's not happy
with Phil neither.</i>

20:48.706 --> 20:50.072
<i>I know.</i>

20:50.176 --> 20:52.070
<i>You're not part
of that family.</i>

20:52.177 --> 20:55.080
<i>You're basically retired.
Everybody trusts you.</i>

20:55.185 --> 20:58.052
<i>What I'm thinking, you'd supply
a neutral location,</i>

20:58.186 --> 21:00.912
<i>Guarantee
everybody's safety.</i>

21:01.028 --> 21:02.881
<i>I could do that.</i>

21:30.455 --> 21:32.283
- Hi, George.
- Hey.

21:32.458 --> 21:34.380
They're here.
They've been patted down too.

21:53.107 --> 21:54.743
Anybody want a water?

21:58.118 --> 22:00.373
- No.
- No.

22:01.746 --> 22:04.811
<i>We started it?
We got a dead goomar</i>

22:04.916 --> 22:07.712
In Queens and her
old ukrainian father.

22:07.826 --> 22:09.282
And I'm not even gonna blame Phil.

22:09.387 --> 22:12.050
John Sacramoni,
my friend,

22:12.098 --> 22:14.022
I'm sorry to say,
was an insecure guy.

22:14.097 --> 22:16.590
He created
a constant tension

22:16.666 --> 22:18.463
Within his own family
which spilled over.

22:20.095 --> 22:22.763
Go ahead, Carmine.
George was good enough

22:22.838 --> 22:25.733
To broker this meeting for us.
You're just gonna sit there?

22:27.008 --> 22:29.070
It didn't have
to be this way.

22:32.017 --> 22:34.743
We agree.
It's gone too far.

22:34.848 --> 22:38.053
Phil, I don't know--
He's changed.

22:38.086 --> 22:41.420
You got my word:
we'll back off.

22:41.428 --> 22:44.652
My price is you help us
get a location on Phil.

22:48.427 --> 22:51.592
Uh, I can't go there.

22:51.767 --> 22:53.831
But you do
what you gotta do.

22:59.935 --> 23:02.470
One more thing:
you hit my brother-In-Law.

23:02.607 --> 23:04.771
- So?
- This is my sister

23:04.847 --> 23:06.773
We're talking about.

23:06.848 --> 23:08.982
She's gotta see
something out of this.

23:11.858 --> 23:14.010
We'll come up
with a number.

23:49.158 --> 23:52.120
Look at all this mail.

23:54.195 --> 23:57.022
Anybody need
some barber's scissors?

23:58.398 --> 24:00.662
- Ton'?
- Put some next to my coat.

24:04.577 --> 24:06.732
He was at the safe house.
We brought him over.

24:06.878 --> 24:08.541
Get him the fuck out.

24:08.705 --> 24:10.171
These are snakes
with fur.

24:10.248 --> 24:11.841
<i>The old italians
will tell you--</i>

24:11.948 --> 24:13.570
You can't even
put them around a baby.

24:13.717 --> 24:15.341
They suck the breath
right out.

24:15.446 --> 24:18.082
Well, you're the only baby
here, so we're ahead of the game.

24:18.218 --> 24:20.353
You wanna be wearing his
fucking pelt on your head?

24:20.525 --> 24:22.680
- I said get rid of him.
- Leave him.

24:22.755 --> 24:24.753
He's a good guy.

24:46.216 --> 24:48.313
<i>No payphone.</i>

25:01.965 --> 25:03.892
<i>...Daughter
Gloria on the TV series...</i>

25:03.937 --> 25:06.430
Look, there's
a double-Breasted Robin.

25:06.498 --> 25:08.760
<i>It doesn't cost
anything to be polite.</i>

25:08.905 --> 25:11.003
<i>That goes two ways, ma'am.</i>

25:11.107 --> 25:12.631
<i>...Series "maude"?</i>

25:12.737 --> 25:14.203
<i>- Arthur?
- Yes, bea arthur.</i>

25:14.277 --> 25:15.802
<i>Beatrice arthur.</i>

25:15.908 --> 25:18.140
<i>Put an x in the center
box. $300 to the pot.</i>

25:18.278 --> 25:21.270
<i>And we shuffle the
categories around again.</i>

25:21.317 --> 25:24.180
Pat, how are you?

25:26.958 --> 25:29.083
- Hi.
- Livia.

25:29.255 --> 25:32.093
I'm Janice,
her daughter.

25:34.198 --> 25:36.121
What did he say?
I can't--

25:38.636 --> 25:40.530
Uncle jun',

25:40.607 --> 25:43.532
I wanna show you
something.

25:43.637 --> 25:46.000
Bobby and my baby.

25:49.708 --> 25:53.273
- Janice.
- No, I'm Janice.

25:53.447 --> 25:55.380
That's my little girl.
Her name is domenica.

25:55.515 --> 25:59.881
Sweet as she looks, she
left my stove on on purpose,

25:59.955 --> 26:02.853
Put the flame out
with a wet dishrag.

26:03.028 --> 26:05.020
I caught her.

26:13.038 --> 26:15.360
Uncle jun',

26:15.466 --> 26:17.400
I'm afraid
I have bad news.

26:20.477 --> 26:22.403
Bobby's dead.

26:22.508 --> 26:24.471
The ambassador hotel.

26:25.575 --> 26:28.843
Your Bobby,
Bobby baccalieri.

26:28.916 --> 26:31.880
I'm a widow now.

26:38.925 --> 26:40.750
She was inveigling him.

26:40.825 --> 26:42.693
<i>She's after his money.</i>

26:45.767 --> 26:47.663
You're not even
curious about him?

26:50.435 --> 26:53.232
He can fucking rot.

26:56.246 --> 26:57.840
When you were
an inpatient,

26:57.945 --> 27:00.211
You said you might try
and get a job.

27:00.247 --> 27:03.810
I can't now
because of the car.

27:03.888 --> 27:06.210
<i>I need to get
a bus schedule.</i>

27:08.025 --> 27:09.883
The thing is,

27:10.026 --> 27:12.352
Ever since it blew up

27:12.425 --> 27:14.823
I feel, like...

27:14.927 --> 27:17.521
Cleansed or something.

27:17.595 --> 27:19.291
Because...

27:19.396 --> 27:21.193
It was a polluter?

27:22.565 --> 27:24.431
No.

27:24.576 --> 27:27.072
I mean,
just watching it go,

27:27.207 --> 27:30.073
That huge fireball--

27:30.107 --> 27:33.572
You have no idea.
The heat--

27:33.715 --> 27:35.510
My seat melted.

27:35.618 --> 27:38.411
I had been in it
just a few seconds before.

27:44.595 --> 27:46.592
Carlo.

27:52.598 --> 27:55.261
Carlo.

28:04.677 --> 28:06.072
Yeah.

28:06.177 --> 28:08.843
T, I had a meeting down
here with Carlo this morning.

28:08.916 --> 28:11.910
<i>We were supposed to go see butch
and them on a couple of items.</i>

28:12.085 --> 28:13.412
Carlo didn't show.

28:13.487 --> 28:16.851
<i>And he don't answer
his phones neither.</i>

28:16.928 --> 28:18.590
I'll call you back
on the prepay.

28:28.936 --> 28:30.902
Yeah.

28:30.937 --> 28:33.570
<i>- What are you thinking?
- That maybe we were had.</i>

28:33.675 --> 28:36.673
That this fucking butch has
taken out another ranking guy.

28:41.646 --> 28:44.212
<i>T?</i>

28:46.288 --> 28:48.050
What if he flipped?

28:48.126 --> 28:50.982
- Who? Carlo?
- Well?

28:52.828 --> 28:55.763
<i>- You there?
- His kid, the imbecile--</i>

28:55.867 --> 28:57.992
<i>- Jason?
- He got picked up yesterday,</i>

28:58.135 --> 29:00.493
Patsy told me,
for selling ecstasy.

29:07.248 --> 29:08.841
Mead', they're gonna
be here in--

29:08.908 --> 29:12.671
Miss Hunter!
Long time no see.

29:12.815 --> 29:14.343
How are you,
Mrs. Soprano?

29:14.417 --> 29:16.341
Oh my God,
when was it?

29:16.506 --> 29:18.352
It was right around
when you quit college.

29:18.415 --> 29:21.582
You're being kind. I was kicked
out for partying and drunk driving.

29:21.686 --> 29:24.051
Well, I didn't want
to say, but...

29:24.195 --> 29:25.852
Well, that was
always you.

29:25.926 --> 29:27.852
So what are you
up to now?

29:27.927 --> 29:29.862
I'm in my second year
of med school.

29:29.926 --> 29:31.993
<i>- Oh.
- Yeah.</i>

29:32.068 --> 29:33.930
I completed undergrad
at purchase,

29:34.067 --> 29:35.931
Got my act together.

29:36.065 --> 29:38.670
Yes. They're gonna
be here, Meadow.

29:40.607 --> 29:42.542
A man took his horse
to a vet

29:42.608 --> 29:46.172
And the vet says to him,
"why do you have a long face?"

29:46.247 --> 29:48.182
"A horse goes."
There's no man.

29:48.246 --> 29:51.112
Right right.
A horse goes to a vet.

29:51.217 --> 29:53.353
And the vet looks at his
face and he says to him,

29:53.418 --> 29:55.552
<i>- "My friend--" - A
horse goes to the doctor.</i>

29:55.687 --> 29:58.352
The doctor says,
"why the long face?"

30:00.625 --> 30:02.592
Can't tell jokes.

30:02.695 --> 30:04.960
- More pinot grig', Patrick?
- No, thanks.

30:05.068 --> 30:08.262
Speaking of jokers, where's
that other son of yours today?

30:10.038 --> 30:11.802
I didn't think
he was invited.

30:11.878 --> 30:14.333
I just thought with all the
wedding talk, you know...

30:14.447 --> 30:17.603
No no, really, that pal
of his, the other Jason--

30:17.746 --> 30:20.743
I heard he ran
into some trouble,

30:20.885 --> 30:23.142
- Carlo's Jason.
- He's a mess.

30:23.247 --> 30:25.151
All right.

30:25.255 --> 30:27.213
Well, he's got
no shortage of lawyers here.

30:33.056 --> 30:34.992
Ton', Patsy needs
a refill.

30:35.097 --> 30:37.261
- No, Ton', I'll--
- Sit down.

30:44.477 --> 30:47.172
Of course, this one here would
only take the case for free.

30:47.277 --> 30:50.002
That's why we want her over
at Grubman, Grubman & Curcio.

30:50.077 --> 30:51.912
<i>Actually, Mead' and I
have had some conversations</i>

30:51.978 --> 30:54.412
And we may still snag her
over at the firm

30:54.587 --> 30:56.742
- When she's done with law school.
- No kidding?

30:56.818 --> 30:59.812
We went out to dinner with steven
grubman and the subject came up.

30:59.958 --> 31:03.123
<i>Steven was very impressed with
her work at the poverty law center.</i>

31:03.156 --> 31:06.092
He even got into starting
salaries. He was talking $170.

31:06.155 --> 31:09.790
Jesus. Sweetheart,
that's fantastic, huh?

31:09.895 --> 31:11.763
He had had
too much gevrey.

31:11.936 --> 31:13.690
Don't devalue yourself.

31:13.806 --> 31:15.632
<i>We've got a really
interesting case right now.</i>

31:15.666 --> 31:17.801
We're defending
James Trefoglio,

31:17.938 --> 31:20.700
The county commissioner,
on those corruption charges.

31:20.808 --> 31:22.372
Is that your case,
honey?

31:22.476 --> 31:25.010
Bid rigging.
It's got bagmen, whores.

31:25.145 --> 31:28.783
<i>It's fascinating.</i>

31:44.467 --> 31:46.792
Yeah, he does that,

31:46.966 --> 31:49.632
<i>Sometimes most of the day--
Just stares at Chrissy's picture.</i>

31:49.737 --> 31:51.631
The fuck?

31:51.807 --> 31:53.530
You know,
they're funny that way.

31:53.706 --> 31:56.773
I had an aunt,
her cat would only sit

31:56.908 --> 31:59.143
At the exact corners of
the table, staring at her,

31:59.318 --> 32:01.481
Or at the intersection
of two walls, staring in.

32:01.588 --> 32:04.642
This fucking animal
is history, today!

32:04.717 --> 32:06.581
- Pick him up.
- You pick him up.

32:13.557 --> 32:16.422
T, you see
this shit?

32:17.938 --> 32:19.663
<i>Does it all the time,
he says.</i>

32:19.768 --> 32:22.503
- Oh yeah?
- Look at him staring at that dead kid.

32:22.568 --> 32:25.501
<i>Gives me
the fucking creeps.</i>

32:28.078 --> 32:30.502
<i>Walden, give us
some privacy.</i>

32:30.677 --> 32:32.671
Yeah.

32:34.887 --> 32:37.841
Walden-- The fuck kind of
name is that for an Italian?

32:37.956 --> 32:40.352
I was named
after Mr. Bobby Darin--

32:40.456 --> 32:43.521
Walden Robert Cassotto.

32:43.627 --> 32:45.853
Heh.

32:47.928 --> 32:51.531
The Cifaretto crew-- It's a fucking
Chinese fire drill over there,

32:51.697 --> 32:53.561
Especially now that
Carlo is absent.

32:53.638 --> 32:56.103
I know.

32:56.208 --> 32:58.633
I want you
to skipper that thing.

32:58.708 --> 33:02.271
- Really?
- Fucking thing is one big ATM machine.

33:02.378 --> 33:05.711
All our construction with New
York folds right into your kick.

33:05.875 --> 33:08.111
Yeah.

33:08.246 --> 33:10.112
Jesus Christ,
I thought you'd be pleased.

33:10.248 --> 33:12.480
I didn't hand you
the diagnosis of the clap.

33:12.588 --> 33:15.482
With due respect, I'd like
to just mull it a little.

33:17.295 --> 33:19.220
I'm no spring chicken
no more.

33:19.297 --> 33:22.061
I don't want to have me dying on you,
leaving you worse off than before.

33:22.128 --> 33:23.821
Oh, you with
the dead thing.

33:23.895 --> 33:26.132
You got the arms and upper
body of a 20-Year-Old.

33:26.237 --> 33:28.163
I gotta work at that.

33:28.238 --> 33:31.163
And I had the prostate.

33:32.235 --> 33:34.072
All right, sure.

33:34.246 --> 33:36.072
Go ahead.

33:36.247 --> 33:38.912
I'm a little miffled,
but yeah, sit with it.

33:39.016 --> 33:41.310
Thanks, T.
This means everything,

33:41.417 --> 33:43.982
Your faith in me.

34:01.505 --> 34:03.300
In the line of duty.

34:03.437 --> 34:05.131
But we're short-Handed.

34:05.178 --> 34:07.801
Anyway, mid-60s,

34:07.877 --> 34:10.043
Probably used
the payphones.

34:10.106 --> 34:13.342
We don't have payphones. Just a
couple of stations have them anymore.

34:27.326 --> 34:30.293
Get in.

34:41.208 --> 34:43.303
Activity--
That's good.

34:43.406 --> 34:45.409
I can already
see a difference.

34:45.516 --> 34:47.239
Yeah.

34:47.387 --> 34:49.982
Gonna get
back at it myself.

34:53.657 --> 34:56.752
Listen...

34:58.228 --> 35:00.220
I'm gonna join the army.

35:01.998 --> 35:03.823
What?

35:05.698 --> 35:07.591
Did you sign any shit?

35:07.665 --> 35:11.161
No, but this week
I will.

35:11.336 --> 35:13.003
I gotta deal
with rhiannon first.

35:13.175 --> 35:15.441
Rhiannon?
What about your mother?

35:15.576 --> 35:18.543
- Her too.
- Are you nuts?

35:18.576 --> 35:20.312
You wanna get sent
to Iraq?

35:20.415 --> 35:22.340
Afghanistan.

35:22.415 --> 35:24.113
The army's probably
good for my career.

35:24.187 --> 35:26.110
You don't have
a career.

35:26.185 --> 35:27.850
Right.
My ultimate goal is

35:27.955 --> 35:29.952
To qualify for
helicopter pilot training,

35:30.028 --> 35:31.851
<i>Afterwards go to work
for trump or somebody,</i>

35:32.025 --> 35:33.521
Be their personal pilot.

35:35.596 --> 35:38.131
I'm not even gonna tell
your mother about this.

35:38.195 --> 35:40.163
And don't you
do nothing

35:40.198 --> 35:42.202
Until we've had
another chance to talk.

35:42.208 --> 35:45.372
<i>- You hear me?
- Yes.</i>

35:45.376 --> 35:48.301
He's gonna join
the fucking army.

35:55.945 --> 35:58.711
I gotta be frank,

35:58.788 --> 36:02.222
You people got him out
of his room-- Great--

36:02.325 --> 36:04.723
So he can be
cannon fodder?

36:04.798 --> 36:06.523
I wasn't aware
of this latest plan.

36:08.326 --> 36:10.120
Sorry.

36:10.228 --> 36:12.233
I should have gone
before we left the house.

36:13.768 --> 36:15.762
Still on the army thing.

36:18.505 --> 36:21.073
On the other hand, I'm
thinking maybe he could benefit

36:21.148 --> 36:23.502
From the training,
the discipline.

36:23.608 --> 36:25.310
Maybe the army'd be
great for him

36:25.446 --> 36:27.940
If there wasn't
a war going on.

36:30.516 --> 36:33.613
Oh, I didn't tell you,
he spent $200

36:33.686 --> 36:36.353
On a set of cds
that teach arabic.

36:36.527 --> 36:40.090
Jesus Christ, come on. "Shish
kebab"-- What else do you need to know?

36:40.158 --> 36:42.323
He used to just veg
in front of that TV.

36:44.368 --> 36:47.130
He says he wants
to get past the hate,

36:47.267 --> 36:50.100
<i>Focus it only
on the terrorists.</i>

36:50.165 --> 36:52.032
I really can't
reveal much more.

36:52.178 --> 36:54.501
Right.
Even though we're paying.

36:58.875 --> 37:01.273
This whole therapy thing,
I gotta tell you--

37:01.345 --> 37:02.713
What?

37:04.815 --> 37:06.682
My mother was
a borderline personality.

37:06.818 --> 37:09.050
So what?

37:11.526 --> 37:13.522
- I don't know if you knew that.
- No.

37:14.968 --> 37:17.461
Well, I did not have
a very happy childhood.

37:17.536 --> 37:18.861
No?

37:20.297 --> 37:21.801
There was little love
in the house.

37:21.867 --> 37:23.863
He's mentioned your mother
very briefly.

37:24.006 --> 37:26.500
A very difficult woman,

37:26.636 --> 37:28.473
Undermining.

37:28.645 --> 37:30.300
I tried to place her
in a retirement community

37:30.446 --> 37:32.071
<i>For her own good--</i>

37:32.177 --> 37:34.242
She turned on me
completely.

37:38.815 --> 37:41.012
You see, I never could
please my ther.

37:46.557 --> 37:49.591
To what do I owe this
chance to go sake bombing?

37:49.668 --> 37:52.261
We used to have dinner
all the time.

37:52.365 --> 37:56.060
You're gonna get married and
my chances are flying by me.

37:56.206 --> 37:58.603
- Yeah.
- So, your brother,

37:58.708 --> 37:59.702
Our little soldier boy--

37:59.838 --> 38:02.200
What do you think is wrong
with that googootz?

38:02.245 --> 38:05.072
The world is
a sad, fucked-Up place.

38:05.176 --> 38:07.612
If there's so much
suffering in the world,

38:07.717 --> 38:10.940
- Why did you go off the pediatrician bit?
- We talked about that.

38:11.017 --> 38:13.081
You said you wanted to be
a lawyer for black people.

38:13.187 --> 38:15.380
Oh, that's all I said?
Really?

38:15.425 --> 38:18.553
What I said was: the state
can crush the individual.

38:18.628 --> 38:20.791
- New Jersey?
- The government.

38:20.896 --> 38:23.621
Specifically,
the federal government.

38:23.696 --> 38:25.361
And what about
little babies

38:25.435 --> 38:28.560
In the face
of meningitis?

38:28.605 --> 38:30.560
You know what really
turned me?

38:30.605 --> 38:32.973
Seeing the way
italians are treated.

38:33.076 --> 38:36.473
It's like mom says. And if we can
have our rights trampled like that,

38:36.607 --> 38:38.843
Imagine what it's like
for recent arrivals.

38:38.976 --> 38:40.973
- Well...
- If I hadn't seen you

38:41.086 --> 38:43.541
Dragged away all those times by the FBI

38:43.617 --> 38:47.551
Then I'd probably be
a boring suburban doctor.

39:03.107 --> 39:04.461
Bye-Bye.

39:04.535 --> 39:06.933
<i>Wave "bye-Bye, grandpa."</i>

39:06.975 --> 39:09.272
- Bye-Bye, pop-Pop.
- Say "bye-Bye."

39:09.347 --> 39:12.270
- Bye-Bye.
- Bye-Bye.

39:15.187 --> 39:16.611
I gotta make
a phone call.

39:16.748 --> 39:18.851
I'll meet you
at the drugstore.

39:18.985 --> 39:21.922
Tell the goddamn pharmacist
to call Dr. Iaconis.

39:21.986 --> 39:24.990
I should get a 60-Day
supply of the plavix.

39:26.757 --> 39:29.620
Phil! Phil!

39:29.665 --> 39:31.533
<i>Oh my God!</i>

39:32.538 --> 39:34.531
Phil!

39:34.605 --> 39:38.532
Oh my God!
Help!

39:38.636 --> 39:40.302
<i>Help me!</i>

39:40.445 --> 39:43.302
<i>Oh my God!
Oh my God!</i>

39:43.346 --> 39:46.912
My babies!
Somebody help!

39:46.975 --> 39:49.282
Help me!
The babies!

39:49.345 --> 39:51.180
- Somebody help me!
- Okay, okay.

39:51.316 --> 39:53.111
<i>Help me, please!</i>

39:53.188 --> 39:56.280
Oh, God, they're
locked in there!

39:58.857 --> 40:00.720
- Oh!
- Oh shit!

40:11.135 --> 40:14.370
- Seen metro news?
- No.

40:14.478 --> 40:16.642
Your old beat.
Phil Leotardo got popped.

40:18.075 --> 40:20.142
Damn. We're gonna win this thing.

40:35.198 --> 40:37.091
Okay...

40:37.195 --> 40:40.733
As your parents
we don't feel

40:40.835 --> 40:42.863
Joining the army
is in your best interest.

40:43.035 --> 40:45.833
This country is
in a crisis.

40:46.007 --> 40:47.730
How can one soldier
stop it?

40:49.348 --> 40:51.513
When my enlistment's up,

40:51.575 --> 40:53.670
I could join
the CIA or something.

40:53.785 --> 40:56.510
And with a military
background I'll have a leg up.

40:56.686 --> 40:58.910
And as an arabic speaker,
I'll be really useful.

40:59.055 --> 41:01.111
I don't understand.
You're gonna ask the donald

41:01.185 --> 41:04.322
For some time off from your
pilot job to go on CIA missions?

41:04.425 --> 41:06.993
- Everything's a joke to you.
- I'm not having a good time.

41:07.026 --> 41:10.091
Did you or did you not want
me to go to military school?

41:11.297 --> 41:13.363
But I started to cry.

41:13.466 --> 41:16.362
At least you'd have
come out an officer.

41:16.408 --> 41:18.473
Even then
I was opposed to it.

41:18.578 --> 41:20.130
I hate this idea.

41:20.235 --> 41:22.470
I'm applying for
officer's candidate school.

41:22.576 --> 41:24.471
I want to be
a liaison officer

41:24.575 --> 41:27.112
With the local
population anyway.

41:28.887 --> 41:31.810
Officer's candidate school?

41:31.886 --> 41:35.422
You have terrible grades.
You flunked out of college.

41:35.456 --> 41:37.550
Here we go. That's all
this is about, right?

41:37.657 --> 41:39.691
No, Anthony, that's not
what this is all about.

41:39.795 --> 41:41.761
You don't want to go to
college-- Don't go to college,

41:41.798 --> 41:44.560
- But don't get your legs blown off.
- Always with the Drama.

41:44.668 --> 41:48.401
So what does your girlfriend
say, the fashion model?

41:49.665 --> 41:51.600
She doesn't think
I should go either.

41:51.675 --> 41:53.673
Well?

41:55.345 --> 41:57.771
Not that long ago you
talked about owning a club.

41:57.846 --> 41:59.842
Right. You had a problem with that too.

42:01.247 --> 42:03.240
A lot of your friends are
in film school, you say,

42:03.347 --> 42:06.251
Especially the ones you
used to go to the clubs with.

42:10.797 --> 42:12.690
Uh...

42:12.756 --> 42:15.660
So I got this screenplay
from danny baldwin.

42:15.768 --> 42:17.920
<i>We met at your
cousin's movie.</i>

42:18.038 --> 42:20.191
Danny hoped I'd set him
up with some financing,

42:20.267 --> 42:23.430
- But I never read it.
- Well, you did now.

42:23.605 --> 42:26.102
Yeah, I did now and...

42:26.208 --> 42:28.471
Well, long story short, it's
about a private detective

42:28.508 --> 42:31.473
That gets sucked into the internet
through his, uh, data port.

42:31.615 --> 42:34.211
And he's gotta solve

42:34.316 --> 42:36.982
Some murders and some
virtual prostitutes.

42:37.057 --> 42:39.482
I read it.
It's scary.

42:39.617 --> 42:41.451
Point is, I talked
to little Carmine

42:41.626 --> 42:43.952
And he's interested in
developing it through his company.

42:44.028 --> 42:46.191
He does porn.

42:49.125 --> 42:51.890
He did "cleaver."
He's branching out.

42:51.967 --> 42:54.291
<i>You would work
for his producer, inge.</i>

42:54.336 --> 42:56.132
You would be--
What is the word--

42:56.208 --> 42:58.900
Development executive
on this project.

42:58.977 --> 43:01.172
Really?

43:04.177 --> 43:05.973
What's this gotta do
with clubs?

43:06.075 --> 43:08.743
Hollywood and gossip
columns, the nightspots...

43:08.845 --> 43:11.983
And you get some real-World
experience under your belt,

43:12.018 --> 43:13.981
You come see me
and we will talk

43:14.086 --> 43:15.723
About me investing
in a club.

43:15.827 --> 43:18.321
Run that past rahoony,
see what she says.

43:27.765 --> 43:31.202
Somebody's giving grand
jury testimony on something.

43:32.937 --> 43:36.400
<i>- So Carlo has flipped.
- We don't know.</i>

43:37.416 --> 43:39.771
And subpoenas are flying.

43:47.187 --> 43:49.452
My hunch--

43:49.587 --> 43:52.850
80 to 90% chance
you'll be indicted.

43:52.927 --> 43:54.593
<i>That fucking
gun charge--</i>

43:54.698 --> 43:56.520
I get sick
when I think of it--

43:56.696 --> 44:00.463
Plus interstate fraud and if
Carlo starts talking, homicide--

44:00.505 --> 44:02.101
Give me
the fucking thing.

44:08.306 --> 44:11.442
Not like we haven't
envisioned this day.

44:11.548 --> 44:13.070
No no, it's not.

44:13.148 --> 44:15.983
Look, trials are there
to be won.

44:22.957 --> 44:25.150
<i>...Easiest omelet ever.</i>

44:25.295 --> 44:28.062
<i>In 10 seconds you can
open a can of instant soup</i>

44:28.127 --> 44:30.823
<i>Or you can make homemade
soup from scratch,</i>

44:30.898 --> 44:33.260
<i>Ready to eat
and serve!</i>

44:33.336 --> 44:35.261
<i>In 10 seconds
you can begin</i>

44:35.337 --> 44:37.231
<i>Grating cheese
for a snack</i>

44:37.335 --> 44:39.232
<i>Or you can grate cheese,
shred chicken,</i>

44:39.336 --> 44:41.642
<i>Chop onions and peppers
to make a zesty filling</i>

44:41.745 --> 44:43.400
<i>That you can
heat and serve</i>

44:43.506 --> 44:46.641
<i>For hot delicious quesadillas
the whole family will love--</i>

44:46.746 --> 44:49.142
<i>All three
ready to heat and serve...</i>

44:49.248 --> 44:51.410
<i>- oh.
- ...All in 10 seconds or less</i>

44:51.486 --> 44:53.080
<i>With the original
magic bullet--</i>

44:53.257 --> 44:55.320
<i>The versatile personal
countertop magician</i>

44:55.428 --> 44:58.721
<i>That does any job
in 10 seconds or less.</i>

44:58.827 --> 45:01.053
<i>Now you can do
small everyday jobs</i>

45:01.096 --> 45:02.793
<i>Like chopping
garlic or onions</i>

45:02.867 --> 45:05.691
<i>Without the sticky, smelly
mess in just three seconds.</i>

45:05.836 --> 45:07.690
<i>Grate cheese
in just four seconds.</i>

45:07.838 --> 45:09.700
<i>Then screw on
the handy shaker top</i>

45:09.837 --> 45:11.871
<i>And sprinkle
onto pasta or pizza.</i>

45:12.006 --> 45:14.843
<i>Or turn ice, coffee,
milk and chocolate syrup</i>

45:14.877 --> 45:17.103
<i>Into a fancy frozen
coffee drink in just se--</i>

45:33.495 --> 45:35.391
Oh my gosh,
I won, I won, I won, I won!

46:01.587 --> 46:03.480
So?

46:06.925 --> 46:11.162
With all due respect, and I mean
that from the bottom of my heart,

46:11.236 --> 46:13.992
- I'm gonna pass.
- I don't fucking believe this.

46:15.667 --> 46:18.700
- Why?
- Every guy who ran that crew died prematurely.

46:18.778 --> 46:21.001
- Aw, come on.
- I beat cancer once.

46:21.105 --> 46:22.701
You've got no idea
what that does to you.

46:22.778 --> 46:24.100
Yeah, I know,
but Jesus--

46:24.218 --> 46:27.172
Richie Aprile, Ralphie m.I.A.; Vito,

46:27.248 --> 46:29.183
And who knows what the
fuck with Carlo, gigi--

46:29.247 --> 46:30.941
Gigi died
taking a shit.

46:31.017 --> 46:34.412
Doesn't mean it's not
part of an overall pattern.

46:37.195 --> 46:40.123
Paulie, are you gonna deny
yourself life-Changing money,

46:40.198 --> 46:42.362
A package to leave
your niece who has m.S.?

46:42.527 --> 46:45.290
It's like your bullshit
with the cat.

46:45.366 --> 46:47.293
The fucking animal
catches mice for us,

46:47.366 --> 46:48.862
- But you'd drown it.
- I would.

46:48.938 --> 46:51.062
He's not looking
at Christopher.

46:51.205 --> 46:53.700
A rat died in the wall
back there or some shit.

46:53.808 --> 46:55.943
I moved the picture.
The fucking thing

46:56.046 --> 46:58.072
Came to the new spot
and stared!

47:01.988 --> 47:03.841
It's the abstract shapes
or something.

47:10.325 --> 47:12.222
Tell you this:

47:12.325 --> 47:14.222
Since he's dead,

47:14.395 --> 47:17.392
My gambling luck's
done a 180.

47:17.495 --> 47:19.060
Oh, okay.

47:19.137 --> 47:21.131
<i>It's fine for you
to believe that shit,</i>

47:21.265 --> 47:23.803
But I can't
worry about a jinx?

47:30.778 --> 47:34.112
Ton', I never told this to
another living soul, but...

47:36.918 --> 47:38.251
Yeah?

47:38.355 --> 47:41.522
One time at the bing,

47:41.585 --> 47:44.523
I was alone to meet
eddy lind--

47:44.656 --> 47:48.690
I saw the virgin Mary.

47:54.508 --> 47:56.862
Why didn't you
say something?

47:56.967 --> 47:59.770
Fuck strippers,
we coulda had a shrine,

47:59.935 --> 48:02.141
Sold holy water
in gallon jugs.

48:02.278 --> 48:04.142
Coulda made billions.

48:04.275 --> 48:07.040
I tell you something deep in
my heart and you laugh it off?

48:07.146 --> 48:09.181
I'm not saying there's
nothing out there, Paulie,

48:09.288 --> 48:12.382
But to not live your life?
What the fuck are you gonna do?

48:14.058 --> 48:16.621
You don't want the job--
You don't want the job.

48:16.686 --> 48:19.222
I can put Patsy in there.

48:19.327 --> 48:21.692
He's gonna be
part of my family now.

48:21.828 --> 48:24.492
It'd be good.

48:24.567 --> 48:26.233
Prick.

48:26.335 --> 48:28.862
You always know what
to say to me, don't you?

48:28.965 --> 48:31.730
No, I'm serious.

48:42.146 --> 48:44.310
I live but to serve you,
my liege.

49:12.078 --> 49:15.013
Well, they had to
get it for me.

49:15.115 --> 49:17.543
There's no real
public transport out here.

49:17.616 --> 49:20.052
But I said no more suv.

49:38.708 --> 49:41.472
Well, that's
the cool part--

49:41.605 --> 49:44.270
23 highway.
It's not so bad.

50:04.937 --> 50:06.831
Hey.

50:08.965 --> 50:12.231
Hey.

50:12.306 --> 50:14.471
Oh, listen, we're not
eating at home tonight.

50:14.577 --> 50:16.043
I thought we'd go
to holsten's.

50:16.108 --> 50:17.300
You said we have
manigott'.

50:17.415 --> 50:19.470
I got meetings
with carpenters.

50:59.485 --> 51:01.780
Holsten's is
the consensus.

51:01.925 --> 51:05.152
I gotta see some people.
I'll meet you there.

51:08.365 --> 51:10.820
<i>- Carter?
- That's correct.</i>

51:10.865 --> 51:12.932
<i>And you win $400.</i>

51:13.095 --> 51:15.330
<i>Your spin, marcia.</i>

51:17.437 --> 51:19.773
<i>- Joker, Africa and quotations.
- Sir.</i>

51:19.878 --> 51:21.700
<i>I'll take
quotations for 100, please.</i>

51:21.848 --> 51:23.800
Sir, sir,
excuse me.

51:23.878 --> 51:25.972
<i>...Explained
his humor this way:</i>

51:26.048 --> 51:28.513
<i>"All I know is just
what I read--" Where?</i>

51:28.647 --> 51:29.912
<i>"In the papers."</i>

51:29.986 --> 51:31.513
<i>That's right. You have $200.</i>

51:31.655 --> 51:35.022
<i>- Your spin, Ron.
- Okay, thank you, Jack.</i>

51:35.126 --> 51:38.890
<i>Law enforcement,
quotations and a joker.</i>

51:39.026 --> 51:40.893
<i>Let's take
quotations for 100, Jack.</i>

51:41.025 --> 51:42.963
<i>The correct answer
will bring you $500...</i>

51:44.698 --> 51:48.230
- hello.
- What, you don't recognize me?

51:49.806 --> 51:51.970
We used to play catch.

51:53.706 --> 51:57.201
You don't remember
that you shot me?

52:01.885 --> 52:03.483
Enough with
the fucking birds.

52:03.647 --> 52:05.350
I'm Anthony,
Johnny's son.

52:05.417 --> 52:07.652
Fuck you want,
a boutonniere?

52:14.496 --> 52:16.623
All right, listen to me.
Uncle pat came to see me

52:16.667 --> 52:19.860
About Janice,
about your money.

52:20.036 --> 52:22.530
People keep asking me.
I don't know.

52:22.666 --> 52:25.400
There's a man from another
galaxy that came here.

52:25.536 --> 52:26.701
That's your accountant.

52:27.777 --> 52:28.943
I'm confused!

52:29.047 --> 52:32.073
Any money should go
to Bobby bacala's kids.

52:32.176 --> 52:36.011
Now Janice may not do that,
but Bobby was with us.

52:36.186 --> 52:38.513
He's a made guy.
Wouldn't be right.

52:40.385 --> 52:42.623
Me, I never had kids.

52:44.197 --> 52:46.452
You remember where your stash
is, you let uncle pat know.

52:46.626 --> 52:48.523
Me as the head
of the family,

52:48.597 --> 52:51.361
I'll hold on to it as a
guardian, for Bobby's kids.

52:53.067 --> 52:55.262
- You remember Bobby?
- Sure.

53:00.607 --> 53:03.243
You don't know
who I am, do you?

53:12.055 --> 53:14.780
Remember Johnny--
Johnny boy,

53:14.928 --> 53:17.380
Your kid brother?

53:27.638 --> 53:29.632
"This thing of ours."

53:32.235 --> 53:34.570
I was involved with that?

53:34.746 --> 53:37.573
You and my dad.

53:37.746 --> 53:39.512
You two ran north Jersey.

53:39.578 --> 53:42.513
- We did?
- Yeah.

53:42.648 --> 53:44.510
Hmm.

53:44.615 --> 53:46.753
Well, that's nice.

55:25.858 --> 55:28.282
- Hey.
- Hey.

55:43.876 --> 55:47.631
- What looks good tonight?
- Eh, I don't know.

55:52.545 --> 55:53.942
Where's googootz?

55:54.046 --> 55:57.140
He just called.
He's on his way.

55:57.286 --> 56:00.913
Mead's coming separately.
She had to go to the doctor,

56:01.058 --> 56:03.451
Switch birth control.

56:13.465 --> 56:15.602
Did you talk
to mink again?

56:17.406 --> 56:19.770
It's Carlo.
He's gonna testify.

56:35.655 --> 56:37.583
Mmm, onion rings.

56:37.655 --> 56:40.093
Best in the state
as far as I'm concerned.

57:01.018 --> 57:02.940
Shit.

57:21.967 --> 57:23.630
How was work today?

57:23.737 --> 57:26.471
All I'm doing is getting coffee
and placing endless phone calls.

57:26.575 --> 57:28.872
You may not realize it
but you are making contacts.

57:28.977 --> 57:30.872
It's an entry-Level job.

57:30.975 --> 57:33.611
So buck up.

57:33.748 --> 57:35.611
Right, focus
on the good times.

57:35.746 --> 57:37.640
Don't be sarcastic.

57:37.758 --> 57:39.613
Isn't that what
you said one time--

57:39.757 --> 57:41.310
"Try to remember the times
that were good"?

57:41.388 --> 57:43.152
- I did?
- Yeah.

57:46.157 --> 57:48.393
Well, it's true,
I guess.

58:25.938 --> 58:28.701
I went ahead and ordered
some for the table.
