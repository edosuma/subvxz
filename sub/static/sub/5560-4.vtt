09:49.241 --> 09:51.574
we use to categorize
our lab specimens.

09:51.576 --> 09:52.876
Which specimens?

09:52.878 --> 09:54.244
Let me check.

09:55.613 --> 09:56.946
(Juliette)
This is weird.

09:59.617 --> 10:01.451
I think you need
to talk to my boss.

10:01.453 --> 10:03.419
Each of these numbers
corresponds

10:03.421 --> 10:06.122
with a sample vial
of an infectious disease.

10:06.124 --> 10:07.957
SARS, MERS...

10:07.959 --> 10:09.559
typhoid fever,
Ebola.

10:09.561 --> 10:11.528
Wait, those vials
are kept here?

10:11.530 --> 10:13.263
None of those diseases
have any cure.

10:13.265 --> 10:16.032
Shouldn't they be kept in
a biohazard Level 4 facility?

10:18.469 --> 10:21.738
We have an undisclosed
BHL4 lab at this facility.

10:21.740 --> 10:24.741
(Rebecca) Knowledge of the lab
is strictly need-to-know.

10:24.743 --> 10:26.709
Most of our own employees
aren't even aware of it.

10:26.711 --> 10:29.045
So other than the fact that
these are dangerous diseases,

10:29.047 --> 10:30.780
what else do they
have in common?

10:30.782 --> 10:32.982
I mean, there's got to be
a reason they were singled out.

10:32.984 --> 10:34.284
I wish
I could tell you.

10:34.286 --> 10:35.852
Actually, I think
I have something.

10:35.854 --> 10:37.921
It looks like Walter

10:37.923 --> 10:40.957
was the last person to
access all of the vials.

10:40.959 --> 10:42.792
- Walter?
- Walter Tunnel.

10:42.794 --> 10:45.161
He was our former director.

10:45.163 --> 10:46.763
Where can we find him?

10:46.765 --> 10:49.299
Unfortunately, Walter died
in an accident two years ago.

10:49.301 --> 10:52.902
He was infected with a...
a rare form of botulism.

10:52.904 --> 10:54.237
How'd he get infected?

10:54.239 --> 10:56.306
There was a tear
in his safety suit.

10:56.308 --> 10:57.907
It never
should've happened.

10:57.909 --> 11:00.176
It's taken us a long time
to get over the loss.

11:00.178 --> 11:01.744
He was a wonderful man.

11:01.746 --> 11:03.246
We're gonna need
to see those vials.

11:03.248 --> 11:04.347
Of course.

11:04.349 --> 11:05.782
Juliette, take them
down to BHL4.

11:05.784 --> 11:08.618
I'll, uh, call in
the clearance.

11:08.620 --> 11:09.986
(Weller)
Reade, Zapata, find out

11:09.988 --> 11:11.588
everything you can about
Walter's accident

11:11.590 --> 11:12.922
and his connection
to the vials.

11:12.924 --> 11:14.257
Hey, Juliette.

11:14.259 --> 11:16.326
Did you know Walter
personally?

11:16.328 --> 11:18.695
Yeah, I knew him
really well.

11:18.697 --> 11:20.163
I took his
epidemiology class

11:20.165 --> 11:22.966
at Columbia, and then
I interned for him.

11:22.968 --> 11:25.134
I was there
when he died.

11:25.136 --> 11:27.203
It was...

11:27.205 --> 11:28.805
It was a real shock.

11:28.807 --> 11:31.140
He was always
so careful.

11:31.142 --> 11:32.342
Good to go?

11:32.344 --> 11:34.210
Yeah,
we're all set.

11:34.212 --> 11:36.344
Now, the process for
entering a BHL4 lab

11:36.379 --> 11:37.947
is a bit more complicated.

11:37.949 --> 11:39.983
Let's get suited up and I'll
walk you guys through it.

11:39.985 --> 11:41.150
Good.

11:44.788 --> 11:46.770
- (door opens)
- Hey. Sorry.

11:46.805 --> 11:48.358
Just wanted to check in
on the Guerrero file,

11:48.360 --> 11:49.359
see where we're at.

11:49.361 --> 11:50.526
I'm handling it.

11:50.528 --> 11:52.195
Right... it's just,

11:52.197 --> 11:55.131
Jane's tattoo is directly
related to this file,

11:55.133 --> 11:56.399
and... and this could be
the key to everything.

11:56.401 --> 11:57.467
If you could get it
unredacted...

11:57.469 --> 11:58.468
I can't do that.

11:58.470 --> 12:00.069
Okay...

12:00.071 --> 12:03.573
Is...
Is there a... a reason

12:03.575 --> 12:06.173
that you don't want me
looking into this case?

12:06.208 --> 12:10.747
We still have agents in
the field who could be affected.

12:10.749 --> 12:13.850
It's too dangerous
to start poking around.

12:13.852 --> 12:15.385
I understand that.

12:15.387 --> 12:18.421
But if you could just
give me some context...

12:18.423 --> 12:22.659
When I say it's too dangerous,
it's too dangerous.

12:22.661 --> 12:24.994
- I just... we're so...
- Tell me something.

12:24.996 --> 12:27.830
That CDC tattoo
you solved today,

12:27.832 --> 12:30.566
"on your own"...

12:30.568 --> 12:32.268
how'd you really
crack it?

12:39.276 --> 12:41.544
Maybe you should
get back to work.

12:41.546 --> 12:43.212
Yes, ma'am.

12:47.384 --> 12:48.885
(keypad beeping)

12:48.887 --> 12:51.421
(beep, airlock hisses)

12:51.423 --> 12:54.691
Follow me.

12:54.693 --> 12:56.759
This is our BHL4 lab.

12:56.761 --> 13:01.030
All the specimens are kept
in a negative 70-degree freezer.

13:03.901 --> 13:05.201
(beep)

13:07.571 --> 13:09.539
Shut the door
behind you, please.

13:09.541 --> 13:10.873
Yes, ma'am.

13:17.114 --> 13:19.415
(air lock hisses)

13:40.104 --> 13:41.738
That's strange.

13:42.940 --> 13:43.940
It should
be right here.

13:43.942 --> 13:45.308
Maybe it got mislabeled.

13:45.310 --> 13:46.342
Check the next number.

13:49.070 --> 13:50.848
_

13:56.186 --> 13:57.687
It's not there, either.

13:57.835 --> 13:58.977
_

14:03.260 --> 14:05.928
So far, all the vials
from the tattoos are missing.

14:05.930 --> 14:06.929
How is this possible?

14:06.931 --> 14:08.197
(alarm buzzing)

14:08.199 --> 14:09.198
What is that?

14:09.200 --> 14:10.800
Did we set something off?

14:10.802 --> 14:12.535
No, it wasn't us.
There must have been a breach.

14:12.537 --> 14:13.703
We're in lockdown.

14:21.435 --> 14:22.970
(alarm buzzing)

14:22.972 --> 14:24.038
(Jane)
A breach?

14:24.040 --> 14:25.272
Wh-What does that mean?

14:25.274 --> 14:26.607
Are... are we safe
in here?

14:26.609 --> 14:28.108
It could be
security-related

14:28.110 --> 14:29.810
or a compromise
in one of the labs.

14:29.812 --> 14:30.945
I just don't know.

14:30.947 --> 14:32.780
When was the last time
this happened?

14:32.782 --> 14:34.615
It was when Walter died.

14:34.617 --> 14:38.385
He was the last person
to access the missing vials.

14:38.387 --> 14:40.326
- I need to regroup with my team.
- No, I'm sorry.

14:40.361 --> 14:42.056
That's just not
gonna be possible.

14:42.058 --> 14:44.227
We have to stay here until
the lockdown is lifted.

14:44.262 --> 14:46.819
For how long?
How long?!

14:46.974 --> 14:50.084
_

14:50.699 --> 14:52.833
Timing of this seem
a little weird to you?

14:52.835 --> 14:53.834
Very.

14:55.537 --> 14:57.071
Think Jane and Weller
are okay?

14:57.073 --> 14:58.339
Something might have
happened with those vials.

14:58.341 --> 15:00.741
They're wearing
HAZMAT suits.

15:00.743 --> 15:03.510
Probably the safest ones
in here.

15:03.512 --> 15:05.079
We should
be in there with them.

15:05.081 --> 15:06.480
I'm glad we're not.

15:08.850 --> 15:11.585
You really wanna be stuck in
a room with Weller right now?

15:11.587 --> 15:14.355
No window, no way out?

15:14.357 --> 15:16.190
(chuckling)

15:16.192 --> 15:18.525
That is a control freak's
worst nightmare.

15:25.900 --> 15:27.735
Here, why...
Why don't you sit?

15:27.737 --> 15:29.903
This feels deliberate.

15:29.905 --> 15:32.840
Walter accesses those vials
and then dies in an accident.

15:32.842 --> 15:35.743
As soon as we find out they're
gone, we get locked in here.

15:35.745 --> 15:38.345
I... I agree, it's too
big of a coincidence,

15:38.347 --> 15:41.215
but what can we do?

15:41.217 --> 15:44.218
I mean, Juliette said
it's gonna be a while.

15:45.553 --> 15:47.554
(sighs)

15:47.556 --> 15:48.622
Kurt.

15:50.625 --> 15:52.459
Sit, please.

15:52.461 --> 15:54.094
You're making me nervous.

15:55.930 --> 15:56.964
Here.

16:07.375 --> 16:10.144
Will you tell me
about that night?

16:10.146 --> 16:11.979
The night I went missing.

16:11.981 --> 16:14.214
You... You said
you were there.

16:19.421 --> 16:21.588
I was the only one there.

16:22.957 --> 16:27.828
When your mom
worked nights...

16:27.830 --> 16:30.064
she'd ask me
to take care of you.

16:30.066 --> 16:32.466
And you'd already
gone to bed.

16:32.468 --> 16:34.735
I went in
to check on you.

16:37.672 --> 16:39.406
And you were gone.

16:41.109 --> 16:42.676
Then what happened?

16:42.678 --> 16:44.044
I searched for you.

16:44.046 --> 16:46.413
I checked
the whole house.

16:48.016 --> 16:50.484
Did someone break in?

16:50.486 --> 16:54.288
There were no signs
of forced entry.

16:54.290 --> 16:56.090
No doors were open.

16:57.959 --> 16:59.660
No windows were open.

17:02.864 --> 17:04.598
You just vanished.

17:27.288 --> 17:29.156
Were there
any suspects?

17:32.794 --> 17:33.827
Only one.

17:35.697 --> 17:37.231
My father.

17:40.969 --> 17:45.672
But there was never
any physical evidence.

17:45.674 --> 17:48.308
We lied about his alibi.

17:50.245 --> 17:53.881
People thought
that he was...

17:53.883 --> 17:55.916
he was too close.

17:57.185 --> 17:58.685
He was close to...

18:02.590 --> 18:03.891
He denied it.

18:07.028 --> 18:08.729
He still does.

18:08.731 --> 18:10.364
(alarm sounding)

18:10.366 --> 18:11.765
(woman on PA)
Lockdown has been lifted.

18:11.767 --> 18:13.200
<i>All clear.</i>

18:16.905 --> 18:18.572
I told Frank about
the missing vials.

18:18.574 --> 18:19.706
He's on his way down.

18:19.708 --> 18:21.074
The lockdown?

18:21.076 --> 18:22.298
What happened?

18:22.333 --> 18:24.047
According to security,
it was a false alarm.

18:24.082 --> 18:25.264
But it's strange.

18:25.299 --> 18:27.908
Apparently, Rebecca is
the one who initiated it.

18:29.017 --> 18:30.584
We need to talk
to Rebecca.

18:30.586 --> 18:32.052
She's not here.

18:32.054 --> 18:33.120
Where is she?

18:33.122 --> 18:35.189
I'm sorry,
who are you?

18:35.191 --> 18:37.124
When did she leave?

18:37.126 --> 18:38.792
(woman) Right before the lockdown.
She went to run an errand.

18:38.794 --> 18:41.295
What is this about?
Y-You can't go in there.

18:41.297 --> 18:43.931
Uh, you can't
just do that!

18:47.602 --> 18:49.069
(Reade) How'd she initiate
a lockdown

18:49.071 --> 18:50.604
if she's not even
in the building?

18:50.606 --> 18:52.306
It looks like she
accessed this computer

18:52.308 --> 18:54.741
remotely from her laptop
after she left.

18:54.743 --> 18:56.610
You think she did this
to trap us in here?

18:56.612 --> 18:58.579
Yeah.
Question is why.

18:58.581 --> 19:00.681
That's impossible.
They must have been misplaced.

19:00.683 --> 19:02.115
No, they're missing.

19:02.117 --> 19:03.350
Okay, we need to alert
security right now,

19:03.352 --> 19:04.918
have them review
video footage,

19:04.920 --> 19:06.687
pass codes,
everything they have.

19:06.689 --> 19:08.188
Who had access
to the vials?

19:08.190 --> 19:09.923
Only two people in the CDC
can give clearance

19:09.925 --> 19:12.526
to get into that freezer...
myself and Rebecca.

19:12.528 --> 19:13.827
We're gonna need
to talk to her now.

19:13.829 --> 19:15.095
She's in the wind.

19:15.097 --> 19:16.996
She initiated
a lockdown remotely.

19:17.031 --> 19:18.532
Feels like she wanted
to tie us up.

19:18.534 --> 19:19.476
Remotely from where?

19:19.511 --> 19:21.068
Patterson tracked down
Rebecca's IP address.

19:21.070 --> 19:23.570
She sent the lockdown commands
from a brownstone in Brooklyn.

19:23.572 --> 19:24.638
Let's move it.

19:24.640 --> 19:26.073
Patterson.

19:26.075 --> 19:27.774
Send a team to that
address in Brooklyn.

19:27.776 --> 19:29.710
Find out if Rebecca's there.

19:35.917 --> 19:38.051
(beeping)

19:42.657 --> 19:44.458
(buzzer)

19:44.460 --> 19:46.426
(Patterson)
So it turns out Rebecca

19:46.428 --> 19:47.995
has been running
a secret lab in Brooklyn.

19:47.997 --> 19:49.329
No sign
of the missing vials,

19:49.331 --> 19:51.117
but she had her own
mini CDC in there.

19:51.152 --> 19:52.189
Mass spec machines,

19:52.224 --> 19:54.117
x-ray crystallography lab,
you name it.

19:54.152 --> 19:55.602
Any idea
what she's up to?

19:55.604 --> 19:57.904
Nothing good, but
according to CDC records,

19:57.906 --> 19:59.573
one of the missing vials

19:59.575 --> 20:02.142
contains a rare strain
of viral hemorrhagic fever.

20:02.144 --> 20:05.587
Essentially the deadlier cousin
of Ebola with no known cure.

20:05.622 --> 20:09.216
What would happen if that was
released into the population?

20:09.218 --> 20:11.652
An outbreak like
we've never seen.

20:11.654 --> 20:14.254
Possibly millions
of casualties.

20:14.256 --> 20:15.789
Any leads on Rebecca?

20:15.791 --> 20:17.257
She's gone dark.

20:17.259 --> 20:18.592
Her phone's
not operational

20:18.594 --> 20:20.127
and she hasn't logged on
to her computer

20:20.129 --> 20:21.261
since the lockdown.

20:21.263 --> 20:22.729
That's not
very promising.

20:22.731 --> 20:24.298
So we're gonna find her
and find out

20:24.300 --> 20:26.166
what she's planning
to do with those vials.

20:26.168 --> 20:28.514
This map shows the origins
of disease outbreaks

20:28.549 --> 20:29.970
from the past five years.

20:29.972 --> 20:32.606
Several of them correspond
with the disease specimens

20:32.608 --> 20:33.707
in the missing vials.

20:33.709 --> 20:35.642
Ebola. SARS.

20:35.644 --> 20:37.778
MERS. Typhoid fever.

20:37.780 --> 20:38.739
They were contained
eventually,

20:38.774 --> 20:40.614
but not before tens
of thousands of people died.

20:40.616 --> 20:41.902
We've been tracking
Rebecca's movements

20:41.937 --> 20:43.183
for the past few years.

20:43.185 --> 20:45.385
Get this:
the last nine major epidemics

20:45.387 --> 20:47.154
occurred in cities
that she's traveled to

20:47.156 --> 20:49.389
or near just before
the outbreaks.

20:49.391 --> 20:50.857
So you're saying
that she started them?

20:50.859 --> 20:52.192
I know it sounds crazy,
but it's actually

20:52.194 --> 20:53.627
a pretty big coincidence
if she didn't.

20:53.629 --> 20:56.296
Rebecca is singlehandedly
responsible

20:56.298 --> 20:57.698
for all of those deaths?

20:57.700 --> 20:58.910
(Weller)
Why would she do this?

20:58.945 --> 21:00.033
I don't know.

21:00.035 --> 21:01.735
But there are ten disease
strains missing

21:01.737 --> 21:03.737
and it looks like
she used nine of them.

21:03.739 --> 21:05.639
She has one left.

21:05.641 --> 21:06.873
The deadliest one.

21:06.875 --> 21:08.408
Why hasn't she
used it yet?

21:08.410 --> 21:09.743
(panting)

21:09.745 --> 21:12.179
Uh, I think I might know.

21:12.181 --> 21:14.681
We just seized these
aerosol cans from her lab.

21:14.683 --> 21:17.250
She was in the process
of weaponizing the virus.

21:17.252 --> 21:19.519
So we just accelerated
her timeline.

21:19.521 --> 21:21.922
She must have realized
it was now or never.

21:21.924 --> 21:23.690
(Weller)
Grabbed one of the prototypes.

21:23.692 --> 21:25.325
Hey, looks like
Rebecca's husband just used

21:25.327 --> 21:27.561
his credit card at
a gas station in Cold Spring.

21:27.563 --> 21:29.329
You think
they're together?

21:29.331 --> 21:31.865
He's the last person she called
before she destroyed her phone.

21:31.867 --> 21:33.074
(Weller)
I'm calling state police.

21:33.109 --> 21:34.401
(dialing)

21:39.173 --> 21:40.407
I don't understand.

21:40.409 --> 21:42.542
How did your mom get
into a car accident?

21:42.544 --> 21:44.077
I mean, whose car
was she driving?

21:44.079 --> 21:46.580
I don't know.

21:46.582 --> 21:48.215
We'll be there soon.

21:51.519 --> 21:52.519
(siren)

21:52.521 --> 21:54.421
I wasn't even speeding.

21:58.960 --> 22:01.027
(second siren)

22:01.029 --> 22:02.896
Another one?
This is ridiculous.

22:02.898 --> 22:03.930
What'd I do?

22:03.932 --> 22:05.420
Just pull over.

22:05.455 --> 22:07.455
(police)
<i>Driver, pull over.</i>

22:08.901 --> 22:12.606
(police) <i>Turn off the ignition,
exit the vehicle...</i>

22:12.608 --> 22:14.374
What the hell
is going on?

22:14.376 --> 22:16.109
Look, I love you.

22:16.111 --> 22:18.145
Please understand.

22:18.147 --> 22:20.385
I am trying
to save the world.

22:20.420 --> 22:21.167
What are you
talking about?

22:21.202 --> 22:23.350
I'm so sorry.

22:23.352 --> 22:25.476
But this will be faster.

22:25.511 --> 22:26.580
Rebecca, what are you...

22:26.615 --> 22:27.159
- (gunshot)
- Uhh! (groaning)

22:27.194 --> 22:28.569
(police officer)
<i>Shots fired!</i>

22:31.813 --> 22:32.947
(gunshot)

22:41.230 --> 22:42.463
Thank you.

22:44.824 --> 22:47.281
(sighs)

22:47.316 --> 22:48.504
Her mother lives upstate.

22:48.539 --> 22:50.573
I think that's where
she might have been heading.

22:50.608 --> 22:52.281
She must have known once
we saw the vials were missing

22:52.316 --> 22:53.899
we'd be onto her.

22:53.901 --> 22:56.268
We just got
the crime scene photos.

22:56.270 --> 22:57.903
The state police
checked the car.

22:57.905 --> 22:59.571
No sign of the missing vial,

22:59.573 --> 23:01.506
but they did find
a parking receipt

23:01.508 --> 23:02.974
from the Manhattan
Cruise Terminal

23:02.976 --> 23:04.409
from about
three hours ago.

23:04.411 --> 23:06.411
Why would she stop
at the pier first?

23:06.413 --> 23:09.514
If she was planning to infect
as many people as possible,

23:09.516 --> 23:11.082
the terminal
would be ideal.

23:11.084 --> 23:12.517
Thousands of people
getting off cruise ships

23:12.519 --> 23:13.952
and getting on the planes
to head home.

23:13.954 --> 23:15.406
Perfect way to spread
the virus around the world.

23:15.441 --> 23:16.588
If that was her plan,

23:16.590 --> 23:17.451
she wouldn't have
to hide the device.

23:17.486 --> 23:19.758
She could put it
somewhere out in the open.

23:19.760 --> 23:22.294
What is this?
Can you zoom in on her watch?

23:24.530 --> 23:26.765
Set on a timer.

23:26.767 --> 23:28.300
About two hours to go.

23:28.302 --> 23:29.434
When was that
photo taken?

23:29.436 --> 23:31.203
2:01 p.m.

23:31.205 --> 23:34.239
So we got until 4:00 p.m.
to find that delivery device.

23:34.241 --> 23:36.041
She wasn't just
running from us.

23:36.043 --> 23:37.212
(Weller) She was trying to get
out of the hot zone.

23:37.247 --> 23:41.733
I'll dial in TSA and NYPD
to order an immediate evacuation

23:41.768 --> 23:44.435
and I'll get our biohazard team
to start suiting up.

23:44.470 --> 23:45.384
No, no, no, no, no.

23:45.419 --> 23:46.635
You're not gonna
make it in time.

23:46.670 --> 23:47.762
We gotta stop this now.

23:47.797 --> 23:50.055
If that device goes off,
a lot of people are gonna die.

23:52.391 --> 23:53.425
Thank you.

23:55.561 --> 23:57.295
(siren wailing)

24:07.640 --> 24:10.609
You blame yourself,
don't you?

24:10.611 --> 24:12.177
For what?

24:12.179 --> 24:13.578
The night
I went missing.

24:13.580 --> 24:16.815
You think
it was your fault.

24:16.817 --> 24:20.118
You know, ever since you
told me I'm Taylor, I've...

24:20.120 --> 24:23.688
been focusing on what
that means for me, but...

24:23.690 --> 24:26.358
you've been living
with this for 25 years.

24:29.213 --> 24:31.781
Have you talked
to your dad about me?

24:36.168 --> 24:39.471
My dad and I...

24:39.473 --> 24:40.972
It's not that simple.

24:43.209 --> 24:45.844
I can't talk about it
right now, Jane.

24:45.846 --> 24:47.612
I don't wanna...
talk about it.

24:51.384 --> 24:52.757
All right.

24:52.792 --> 24:55.287
Here we go.

24:55.289 --> 24:57.622
Looks like the evac's
already underway.

24:59.358 --> 25:01.393
(crowd chattering)

25:06.699 --> 25:08.466
Excuse me.
Move!

25:08.468 --> 25:10.035
What are we
looking for?

25:10.037 --> 25:11.503
Anything that looks
out of place.

25:11.505 --> 25:14.339
In a crowded terminal
during an evacuation?

25:14.341 --> 25:15.740
Should be easy.

25:15.742 --> 25:17.220
(man) Come on, folks,
keep it moving.

25:17.255 --> 25:19.744
(Weller) Excuse me, coming through.
Excuse me.

25:19.746 --> 25:21.646
All right.
Reade, Zapata,

25:21.648 --> 25:23.748
go check the security footage
from a few hours ago.

25:23.750 --> 25:25.984
Jane and I will
search the floor.

25:31.757 --> 25:34.759
Excuse me, coming through,
excuse me.

25:34.761 --> 25:35.994
Jane.

25:42.234 --> 25:44.336
♪

26:12.932 --> 26:15.266
The terminals are
being swept by NYPD.

26:15.268 --> 26:18.803
TSA is securing the ships
and the baggage areas.

26:18.805 --> 26:21.139
So far, I haven't
seen anything unusual.

26:21.141 --> 26:23.074
It's a needle in a haystack.

26:23.076 --> 26:25.243
Rebecca didn't
have a lot of time.

26:29.949 --> 26:31.383
(Jane)
What?

26:31.385 --> 26:32.384
What is it?

26:33.919 --> 26:35.553
See that?

26:35.555 --> 26:37.122
All these bags are linked

26:37.124 --> 26:40.558
with that security chain,
except for that one.

26:40.560 --> 26:42.927
That's not right.

26:42.929 --> 26:45.263
Zapata... you in
the control room?

26:45.265 --> 26:46.720
I'm in front of
the check-in desk.

26:46.755 --> 26:49.080
Review the footage from my
position a couple hours back.

26:49.115 --> 26:50.969
- I think we've got something.
- Pull up the check-in desk.

26:50.971 --> 26:52.837
Can you take it
back a few hours?

26:59.945 --> 27:02.780
There she is.
Rewind it.

27:06.118 --> 27:07.152
We got her.

27:07.154 --> 27:08.987
- Now what?
- We contain it.

27:08.989 --> 27:10.755
How?

27:10.757 --> 27:12.111
Where's the HAZMAT team?

27:12.146 --> 27:13.758
They should
be here by now.

27:13.760 --> 27:15.568
The evacuation caused
a massive traffic jam.

27:15.603 --> 27:16.928
They're having trouble
getting through.

27:16.930 --> 27:18.463
We're running out of time.

27:18.465 --> 27:20.365
How are we gonna
do this on our own?

27:22.201 --> 27:23.368
(Weller)
Patterson?

27:23.370 --> 27:24.769
Okay, okay.

27:24.771 --> 27:27.205
Uh, uh...
We can do this.

27:27.207 --> 27:28.506
I can walk you
through it.

27:28.508 --> 27:29.916
Uh, first, we're
gonna need to prevent

27:29.951 --> 27:31.609
as much collateral damage
as possible.

27:31.611 --> 27:33.996
Every door and window needs
to be shut in the terminal,

27:34.031 --> 27:34.942
and the main HVAC system

27:34.977 --> 27:37.215
- needs to be turned off.
- On it.

27:37.217 --> 27:38.716
Next, we're gonna
need to "MacGyver"

27:38.718 --> 27:40.140
some sort of containment tent
around the bag

27:40.175 --> 27:42.652
before it goes off.

27:42.687 --> 27:44.989
We're on it.

27:44.991 --> 27:46.791
(grunting)
Move it this way.

27:49.795 --> 27:51.663
Reade!
Give me a hand.

27:53.833 --> 27:55.133
(Weller)
Get the broom.

27:57.336 --> 27:58.536
(mutters)
Okay...

28:03.209 --> 28:04.342
(tape ripping)

28:05.545 --> 28:08.381
(Reade)
One more, one more.

28:08.416 --> 28:10.548
(Patterson) <i>The key is to
make it airtight.</i>

28:10.550 --> 28:13.351
You just need it to hold
until HAZMAT gets there.

28:13.353 --> 28:15.019
(Weller)
Reade.

28:18.357 --> 28:21.526
Okay.
That's it.

28:21.528 --> 28:22.927
(Weller)
<i>Bag's contained.</i>

28:22.929 --> 28:24.095
(sighs)

28:27.600 --> 28:29.767
It's 4:00.
Nothing happened.

28:29.769 --> 28:31.669
Maybe we got the wrong bag.

28:31.671 --> 28:33.338
(pop, gas hissing)

28:48.768 --> 28:51.669
(cell phone vibrating)

28:55.540 --> 28:56.674
What's wrong?

28:56.676 --> 28:57.939
(man)
<i>Uh, nothing.</i>

28:57.974 --> 28:59.643
I don't think.
Why, what have you heard?

28:59.645 --> 29:01.133
You never call me at work.

29:01.168 --> 29:02.680
<i>I know, I just...</i>

29:02.682 --> 29:04.181
<i>I had to see
if we were right.</i>

29:04.183 --> 29:06.116
About the tattoo.
It's been killing me.

29:06.118 --> 29:07.551
- No.
- <i>What?</i>

29:07.553 --> 29:08.666
Damn it!

29:08.701 --> 29:10.554
I thought for sure
we cracked that thing.

29:10.556 --> 29:12.613
No, no, no, no, no,
we were right, but...

29:12.648 --> 29:14.658
Yes, I knew it.
Was it a big deal?

29:14.660 --> 29:15.960
It's a big deal, isn't it?

29:15.962 --> 29:17.154
You can't tell me.

29:17.189 --> 29:19.063
That's okay.
It had that feel to it, though.

29:19.065 --> 29:21.332
Yes, it's...
it's a very big deal,

29:21.334 --> 29:22.855
but that's not the point.

29:22.890 --> 29:23.933
<i>I can't do this anymore.</i>

29:23.968 --> 29:25.402
Hey, what'd the bird mean?

29:25.404 --> 29:26.604
Was it a cipher
or something?

29:26.606 --> 29:27.805
It was
a cipher, wasn't it?

29:27.807 --> 29:30.140
No, it was a logo.
No, David!

29:30.142 --> 29:32.743
<i>We have to stop.
You can't help me with this stuff.</i>

29:32.745 --> 29:34.126
These tattoos
are classified.

29:34.161 --> 29:36.013
I mean, you shouldn't
even be looking at them.

29:36.015 --> 29:38.148
Hey, did we solve it
or didn't we?

29:38.150 --> 29:39.929
Yeah, we did, but...

29:39.964 --> 29:41.418
And did it help
or didn't it?

29:41.420 --> 29:42.622
It did, but...

29:42.657 --> 29:44.031
Then what's the problem?

29:44.066 --> 29:45.667
Look, if I can help you crack
some of these faster,

29:45.702 --> 29:47.191
isn't that a good thing?

29:47.193 --> 29:48.826
It's not like
I'm gonna tell anyone.

29:48.828 --> 29:50.227
Uh, I gotta go.

29:50.229 --> 29:51.325
Okay.

29:51.360 --> 29:52.997
Hey, I have a...
like, a weird craving

29:52.999 --> 29:54.578
for that corn dog place
across from Barcade.

29:54.613 --> 29:55.684
Do you want to meet me
there tonight?

29:55.719 --> 29:57.760
Uh, yeah, fine, whatever.

29:57.795 --> 29:59.770
Just... just stop
calling me at work.

30:02.574 --> 30:04.208
(Surrey) Hey, guys.
Come on in.

30:04.210 --> 30:05.743
We need to do
a basic evaluation

30:05.745 --> 30:08.260
and get some blood from
you guys before we let you go.

30:08.295 --> 30:10.347
Wonderful.

30:10.349 --> 30:11.699
Where's, uh,
Special Agent Weller?

30:11.734 --> 30:12.607
(Zapata)
He didn't want to leave

30:12.642 --> 30:14.676
the makeshift containment
tent unattended,

30:14.711 --> 30:15.886
just in case.

30:15.888 --> 30:17.370
We should have
stayed with him.

30:17.405 --> 30:19.390
It's over.
He's fine.

30:19.392 --> 30:21.625
Do you have a radio
for Agent Weller?

30:23.844 --> 30:26.169
Agent Weller, this is
Frank Surrey from the CDC.

30:26.204 --> 30:27.608
I'm here to relieve you.
I need you to report

30:27.643 --> 30:28.882
<i>to the quarantine tent.</i>

30:28.917 --> 30:31.135
I'll stay,
help you seal the area.

30:31.137 --> 30:32.778
Agent Weller, my team
should be here any minute.

30:32.813 --> 30:35.606
Every second you're there, you
increase your risk of exposure.

30:35.608 --> 30:38.576
That's why you're gonna
bring me a HAZMAT suit, Doctor.

30:40.612 --> 30:41.779
I'm on my way.

30:47.218 --> 30:49.587
(Weller)
Did you know her well?

30:49.589 --> 30:52.423
(Surrey)
I thought I did.

30:52.425 --> 30:54.925
Went to school together.

30:54.927 --> 30:56.086
Co-authored
several papers.

30:56.121 --> 30:58.629
I was the one who brought her
into the fold at the CDC.

30:58.631 --> 31:00.464
(computer beeps)

31:00.466 --> 31:02.933
Well, this is very not good.

31:02.935 --> 31:04.635
It's hard not to feel
responsible for this

31:04.637 --> 31:05.836
in some way.

31:05.838 --> 31:08.599
You can't think
like that, Doc.

31:08.634 --> 31:10.174
Hey, Weller,
are you still on VOX?

31:10.176 --> 31:11.942
(grunting)
Uh... yeah.

31:11.944 --> 31:13.347
What's up?

31:13.382 --> 31:17.448
Don't let Dr. Surrey
near the device.

31:17.450 --> 31:18.849
Why is that?

31:18.851 --> 31:20.147
<i>I-I-I've been
cross-referencing</i>

31:20.182 --> 31:21.618
every CDC employee's travel

31:21.653 --> 31:23.454
to see if there
was any overlap

31:23.456 --> 31:25.917
with the outbreaks,
and I just got an alert that

31:25.952 --> 31:28.445
Frank purchased
a plane ticket an hour ago

31:28.480 --> 31:30.628
<i>with short layovers
all around the world.</i>

31:30.630 --> 31:32.196
EDT?

31:32.198 --> 31:33.662
The ticket was bought today.

31:33.697 --> 31:34.865
<i>I think he might
be planning</i>

31:34.867 --> 31:35.936
to infect himself

31:35.971 --> 31:38.302
and fly around the wor
and spread the disease.

31:38.304 --> 31:41.590
He's probably already ripped
his safety suit... and yours.

31:44.976 --> 31:46.725
Doc, stop.

31:46.760 --> 31:48.941
Step away, Doc.

31:48.976 --> 31:50.848
- But I...
- Don't!

31:50.850 --> 31:52.816
It's over.

31:57.355 --> 32:00.924
Rebecca and I spent our
entire lives studying viruses.

32:00.926 --> 32:03.460
Do you know what the greatest
threat to mankind is?

32:03.462 --> 32:05.596
Modern medicine.

32:05.598 --> 32:08.532
Stop!
Don't move!

32:08.534 --> 32:10.834
We create
all these vaccines,

32:10.836 --> 32:14.303
antibiotics...
cures for diseases

32:14.338 --> 32:15.939
that should never be cured.

32:15.941 --> 32:19.943
This planet was not designed
to support 8 billion people.

32:19.945 --> 32:21.779
You're a doctor.

32:21.781 --> 32:23.347
You work
for the CDC.

32:23.349 --> 32:25.115
Your job
is to save lives.

32:25.117 --> 32:27.484
No, my job is to save
the human race.

32:27.486 --> 32:31.021
If we do nothing,
our destruction is guaranteed.

32:31.023 --> 32:32.356
That is insane.

32:32.358 --> 32:33.957
No...

32:33.959 --> 32:37.194
It's already
spiraling out of control.

32:37.196 --> 32:40.631
In your lifetime, we're
gonna see famine, drought,

32:40.633 --> 32:43.167
poverty,
on an unimaginable scale.

32:43.169 --> 32:44.668
Somebody's got to have
the courage

32:44.670 --> 32:47.838
to do what has to be done
to save the human species.

32:47.840 --> 32:50.140
Walter found out,
didn't he?

32:50.142 --> 32:51.709
And that's why
you killed him.

32:51.711 --> 32:53.544
All these diseases
that we're trying

32:53.546 --> 32:55.379
so desperately
to find a cure for

32:55.381 --> 32:56.880
are actually
the last-ditch effort

32:56.882 --> 32:59.253
of a dying planet
trying to save itself,

32:59.288 --> 33:00.918
trying to wipe out
the thing that is actually

33:00.920 --> 33:02.753
destroying it: us.

33:02.755 --> 33:04.054
Don't!

33:10.361 --> 33:11.595
(both grunting)

33:17.335 --> 33:18.836
- Uhh!
- Ohh!

33:25.443 --> 33:26.510
(grunting)

33:36.588 --> 33:38.789
(panting)

33:49.852 --> 33:51.561
The CDC is so solid.

33:51.596 --> 33:53.554
How did Frank and Rebecca
have these radical views

33:53.556 --> 33:55.089
and go undetected?

33:55.091 --> 33:56.724
They're
gifted scientists.

33:56.726 --> 33:58.960
Top of their field.

33:58.962 --> 34:01.462
The CDC had no reason to suspect
that they'd gone rogue.

34:01.464 --> 34:02.864
They almost got away
with it, though.

34:09.972 --> 34:11.272
They're gonna be fine.

34:13.074 --> 34:15.076
We all are.

34:15.078 --> 34:17.277
Hope so.

34:17.280 --> 34:19.632
First the DOD,
then the CDC.

34:19.667 --> 34:22.382
Whoever made these tattoos had
some pretty serious access.

34:22.385 --> 34:25.053
- Definitely.
- Why would they do this to her?

34:25.054 --> 34:27.255
Why kidnap a woman,
wipe her memory,

34:27.257 --> 34:30.458
then tattoo her entire body
with puzzles for us to solve?

34:31.659 --> 34:33.460
Makes her
pretty hard to ignore.

34:36.565 --> 34:39.734
Okay.
Hold that.

34:39.735 --> 34:41.469
And I will
be back in a minute.

34:41.471 --> 34:43.504
You just wait here
for me, okay?

34:49.078 --> 34:51.012
(clears throat)

34:52.347 --> 34:54.081
Hey, good work today.

34:55.751 --> 34:56.751
Thank you.

35:03.025 --> 35:04.517
Look, I know you think
I'm the bad guy

35:04.552 --> 35:06.594
because I didn't
welcome you with open arms.

35:06.596 --> 35:07.962
You think I'm a liability.

35:09.557 --> 35:10.897
I don't know what more
I can do to...

35:10.932 --> 35:13.301
I'm not worried about you.

35:15.003 --> 35:17.472
All of us
depend on Weller.

35:17.474 --> 35:19.507
He's got better judgment
than anyone I've worked with

35:19.509 --> 35:21.042
my whole career.

35:21.044 --> 35:22.710
He's made
split-second decisions

35:22.712 --> 35:25.746
that have saved our lives
more times than I can count.

35:25.748 --> 35:27.949
- I don't understand...
- When he's around you,

35:27.951 --> 35:31.786
the guy I lean on,
the guy I know... isn't there.

35:33.956 --> 35:36.657
And that scares
the hell out of me.

35:36.659 --> 35:38.559
There's nothing
I can do about that.

35:38.561 --> 35:41.129
I know.

35:42.991 --> 35:44.459
That's the problem.

35:53.408 --> 35:55.743
What are you
doing in here?

35:55.745 --> 35:58.746
I was thinking about our
conversation the other night,

35:58.748 --> 36:01.048
regarding
your mystery girl.

36:01.050 --> 36:04.585
This laissez-faire
approach of yours

36:04.587 --> 36:06.220
isn't really
doing it for me.

36:06.222 --> 36:07.355
Tom...

36:07.357 --> 36:08.656
I want to talk to her.

36:08.658 --> 36:09.824
That's not possible.

36:09.826 --> 36:12.026
<i>Anything's</i> possible.

36:12.028 --> 36:14.228
I mean, you of all people
should know that.

36:14.230 --> 36:16.397
Come on, I get
in a room with Jane,

36:16.399 --> 36:18.599
we have a nice little chat,
it'll be great.

36:18.601 --> 36:20.201
I promise not to bite.

36:20.203 --> 36:22.703
I told you I was
managing the situation,

36:22.705 --> 36:24.672
so give me
the time to do that.

36:24.674 --> 36:27.842
Time is the last thing
that we have.

36:27.844 --> 36:31.115
See, if your girl knows about
Daylight, then who else does?

36:31.150 --> 36:33.981
And what do they
know about us?

36:33.983 --> 36:35.716
What, you think
it's a coincidence

36:35.718 --> 36:38.337
that she was gift-wrapped
and delivered to your team?

36:38.372 --> 36:39.787
See, I don't like
the proximity,

36:39.789 --> 36:42.256
and I don't like
the question marks.

36:42.258 --> 36:44.692
Her mind was wiped.

36:44.694 --> 36:47.795
She's just a vessel for
this information, that's all.

36:47.797 --> 36:49.764
What are you
basing that on?

36:49.766 --> 36:52.400
What, a lie detector test
and some psych evals?

36:52.402 --> 36:53.868
Just let me talk to her.

36:53.870 --> 36:55.369
I'm not handing her
over to you

36:55.371 --> 36:57.104
so you can throw her
in some cell and do

36:57.106 --> 37:00.708
whatever it is the CIA does
to find things out.

37:00.710 --> 37:02.243
This doesn't have to be
a straight favor.

37:02.245 --> 37:03.811
What do you
need from me?

37:03.813 --> 37:05.880
Let's make a deal here.

37:05.882 --> 37:08.283
I need for you
to get out of my office.

37:13.889 --> 37:16.791
So be it.

37:16.793 --> 37:19.794
Just remember this later...

37:19.796 --> 37:21.896
when everything's
falling apart

37:21.898 --> 37:23.431
and you're asking
yourself why,

37:23.433 --> 37:25.833
that I came to you first
and tried to play nice.

37:25.835 --> 37:28.803
'Cause the rest is on you.

37:40.282 --> 37:41.884
_

37:58.446 --> 38:00.698
You were
very brave today.

38:03.827 --> 38:07.463
Stupid... but brave.

38:07.590 --> 38:08.562
I think there
was a compliment

38:08.597 --> 38:10.426
in there somewhere.

38:11.179 --> 38:12.313
(mutters)
Yeah.

38:14.716 --> 38:17.318
I'm, um, I'm...

38:17.320 --> 38:19.720
I'm sorry if,
earlier, in the car...

38:32.636 --> 38:35.071
I recognize where
that photo was taken.

38:40.942 --> 38:44.845
We had a creek
at the back of our house.

38:44.847 --> 38:47.014
Just out there.

38:49.280 --> 38:51.281
Used to go fishing there
with my dad.

38:53.226 --> 38:57.195
We didn't... we didn't
catch much, but, uh...

38:57.510 --> 38:59.377
I loved being out there.

39:00.561 --> 39:02.092
My sister,
she was always inside,

39:02.127 --> 39:04.965
playing with her dolls,
but, uh...

39:04.967 --> 39:08.235
but you were a tomboy.

39:08.237 --> 39:11.219
Anytime I was outside,

39:11.254 --> 39:13.808
you'd run out of your house
and try to tag along.

39:16.378 --> 39:19.547
(chuckling)
We...

39:19.549 --> 39:22.616
We had this little...
wooden fort.

39:22.618 --> 39:24.318
(chuckling)

39:24.320 --> 39:28.255
I haven't thought about
that for a long time.

39:30.918 --> 39:32.367
Sorry.

39:32.402 --> 39:35.225
Weller, can I steal you
for a second?

39:35.260 --> 39:36.410
Okay.

39:40.602 --> 39:43.070
(chuckling)

39:43.072 --> 39:45.272
(sighs)
Well...

39:45.274 --> 39:46.574
Yeah.

39:50.566 --> 39:54.365
It's really nice...
to have you back.

40:00.288 --> 40:03.624
(cell phone ringing)

40:06.230 --> 40:07.106
_

40:09.164 --> 40:11.165
That's cold, Tash.

40:11.167 --> 40:14.368
Screening my calls
all day.

40:14.370 --> 40:17.471
I was gonna hit you up
after I got out of the subway.

40:17.473 --> 40:19.463
What are you doing
following me?

40:19.498 --> 40:20.701
If you picked up
your phone, you know,

40:20.736 --> 40:22.276
I wouldn't have
to chase you down.

40:22.278 --> 40:24.211
I'll pay you
as soon as I can.

40:24.213 --> 40:26.876
Jets lost today.

40:26.911 --> 40:29.784
That makes it 40 Gs now.

40:29.786 --> 40:31.352
Let's go again.

40:33.388 --> 40:34.522
Double or nothing.

40:34.524 --> 40:35.856
No.

40:37.026 --> 40:39.460
That's how you
got in this hole.

40:39.462 --> 40:40.895
I want my money.

40:40.897 --> 40:44.654
I'll get it to you.

40:44.689 --> 40:47.501
You know
I'm good for it.

40:47.503 --> 40:49.069
Three days.

40:55.510 --> 40:57.878
All right,
what am I looking at?

40:57.880 --> 40:59.238
Molecules of coltan,

40:59.273 --> 41:01.081
which is short
for columbite tantalite.

41:01.083 --> 41:03.587
My favorite of all
the tantalites.

41:03.622 --> 41:07.916
They're trace isotopic elements
I found in Jane's tooth.

41:07.951 --> 41:09.723
You pulled
one of Jane's teeth?

41:09.725 --> 41:11.225
Well, I-I-I took the one

41:11.227 --> 41:13.703
that was knocked out in
the fight at the safe house.

41:13.738 --> 41:14.471
Right.

41:14.506 --> 41:15.701
I mean, it was
too good to resist.

41:15.736 --> 41:16.989
The human tooth is...

41:17.024 --> 41:19.547
is a goldmine
of genetic information.

41:19.582 --> 41:22.570
Besides, it's not like
she can put it back in.

41:22.572 --> 41:24.203
Yeah, what does
this mean?

41:24.238 --> 41:27.856
These elements would
only be in Jane's enamel

41:27.891 --> 41:30.232
if she was from
Sub-Saharan Africa.

41:30.267 --> 41:32.848
Maybe she was taken there
after she got kidnapped.

41:32.883 --> 41:34.348
Here's the thing.

41:35.717 --> 41:38.185
Isotopes can be aged.

41:38.187 --> 41:39.920
Kind of like
carbon dating.

41:39.922 --> 41:43.757
The markers in her teeth are
from when she was an infant.

41:43.759 --> 41:45.559
So what are you saying?

41:46.751 --> 41:48.262
She was born in Africa.

41:48.264 --> 41:50.865
No. She was born
in Pennsylvania.

41:50.867 --> 41:52.766
I was there the day
they brought her home.

41:52.768 --> 41:54.568
- I'm sorry.
- N-No.

41:54.570 --> 41:56.149
But that's not
what the tooth says.

41:56.184 --> 42:00.207
Your DNA tests confirmed
that she's Taylor Shaw.

42:00.209 --> 42:01.876
So what are you saying?
That's not true?

42:01.878 --> 42:04.119
All I know
is the DNA results

42:04.154 --> 42:06.647
directly contradict
the isotope test.

42:06.649 --> 42:08.382
Is she Taylor Shaw
or not?

42:08.384 --> 42:12.453
Both tests are conclusive,
but both can't be true.

42:13.361 --> 42:15.295
I don't know who she is.
