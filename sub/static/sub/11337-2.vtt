00:09.176 --> 00:10.509
Yes?

00:10.511 --> 00:13.479
Every move that you make,
they can see you.

00:13.481 --> 00:17.716
And if you're not gone by 2:00,

00:17.718 --> 00:20.085
they will kill
the first hostage.

PARKER (over speaker):
Spike, we need
to get in there fast

00:22.556 --> 00:24.590
without tipping them off
or we lose the children.

00:24.592 --> 00:26.492
I'm working on it, boss. I just
need a little bit more time.

00:26.494 --> 00:28.127
No, we don't have time!

00:30.097 --> 00:31.764
ED:
Boss, we're getting
into position.

00:34.635 --> 00:37.036
Bravo Team, black wall.
We're on white.

00:37.038 --> 00:39.438
I am ready to pull my men back
at 2:00 p.m.

00:39.440 --> 00:42.408
if first we can talk about
something you can do for me.

MAN:
Daniel, Jennifer!

00:52.286 --> 00:53.752
Hurry.
Your father's waiting. Come.

00:53.754 --> 00:55.554
Daniel?

00:55.556 --> 00:57.689
Irina, can I wear
my other coat?

00:57.691 --> 01:00.259
No, this coat is beautiful.
And we don't have time.

01:00.261 --> 01:02.094
But I don't really
like this one.

01:02.096 --> 01:03.162
(sighing)

01:03.164 --> 01:04.329
Listen to me.

01:04.331 --> 01:06.398
When I was little girl,
just like you,

01:06.400 --> 01:08.600
I had this dream,
and in that dream,

01:08.602 --> 01:11.370
I'm wearing the most beautiful
coat in the whole world.

01:11.372 --> 01:14.540
And Jennifer, that coat
looked exactly like this one.

01:14.542 --> 01:16.208
Really?

01:16.210 --> 01:19.411
Really.

01:20.714 --> 01:22.448
Irina, I'm ready.

01:22.450 --> 01:24.616
Your bag for the hockey.

01:24.618 --> 01:26.318
Dad already put it in the car.

01:26.320 --> 01:27.553
Okay.

01:27.555 --> 01:30.856
Can't you come today, Irina?

01:30.858 --> 01:32.257
Not today.

01:32.259 --> 01:34.326
But next time, I promise.

01:34.328 --> 01:35.794
Off we go.

01:35.796 --> 01:37.629
Come on, come on,
come on, come on, come on.

01:37.631 --> 01:38.831
Hey, Dad.
Hey.
Hey.

01:38.833 --> 01:40.265
I'll drop them off
around 1:30, okay?

01:40.267 --> 01:41.600
What?
Yeah. Come on, guys.

01:41.602 --> 01:43.002
No, wait, wait.

01:43.003 --> 01:44.403
Maybe you forgot:
it's my afternoon off.

01:44.405 --> 01:45.370
No, no.

01:45.372 --> 01:46.638
I thought Valerie talked to you.

01:46.640 --> 01:47.773
Her plane doesn't get in
till 2:00

01:47.775 --> 01:49.441
and I've got a meeting.
Okay, look.

01:49.443 --> 01:51.343
It won't be very long.
Can you just stay until...?

01:51.345 --> 01:52.878
This afternoon
is just not possible.

01:52.880 --> 01:54.546
Well, I'll...

01:54.548 --> 01:55.647
I'll figure something out.

01:55.649 --> 01:58.250
Is this all right?

01:58.252 --> 01:59.651
Yeah... yeah.

01:59.653 --> 02:01.787
It's not like you don't do
enough for this family.

02:01.789 --> 02:03.722
Right? Let's go, guys.

02:03.724 --> 02:05.891
Have fun.

02:05.893 --> 02:07.426
Bye!
Bye-bye.

02:26.480 --> 02:27.880
I saw the fight the other
night at my brother's.

02:27.882 --> 02:29.248
It was brutal.

02:29.250 --> 02:31.750
UFC?
No, no, the Pacquiao fight.

02:31.752 --> 02:34.286
Dude, boxing is so 20th century.

02:34.288 --> 02:36.221
Hey, it's better than watching
<i> The Lion King.</i>

02:36.223 --> 02:37.723
I took my nephew, okay?

02:37.725 --> 02:40.326
I'm a good uncle.

02:40.327 --> 02:42.928
<i> Lion King? </i>
Hot times on a Saturday night.

02:42.930 --> 02:45.497
They still touring
that thing?

02:45.499 --> 02:46.665
Hey, new girl!

02:46.667 --> 02:47.933
(applauding)

02:51.472 --> 02:52.771
Something I said?

02:52.773 --> 02:55.407
Nah, he's just shy.
Don't worry about it.

02:55.409 --> 02:56.475
Okay.

02:56.477 --> 02:58.610
Sorry.<i> Lion King?</i>

02:58.612 --> 03:00.379
Yeah, Scar still loses, too.

03:00.381 --> 03:02.447
Only surprise was
seeing the boss.

03:02.449 --> 03:04.116
You saw the sarge?

03:04.117 --> 03:05.784
With a nice-looking blonde lady
and a little boy.

03:05.786 --> 03:09.755
Oh, boss hooked up
with a single mom.

03:09.757 --> 03:11.323
Don't look at me.
I don't know.

03:11.859 --> 03:13.725
Come on.

03:13.727 --> 03:15.460
All right.

03:15.462 --> 03:17.429
Her name is Sylvia.

03:17.431 --> 03:19.498
Shut up.

03:19.500 --> 03:22.467
Seriously?

03:22.469 --> 03:24.536
(phone ringing)

03:30.611 --> 03:31.944
Yes?

03:31.946 --> 03:33.312
MAN (on phone):
Are they gone?

03:33.314 --> 03:36.281
Yes, they are gone,
but listen...

03:36.283 --> 03:37.883
(line disconnects)

03:37.885 --> 03:39.952
Misha?

03:47.394 --> 03:48.360
Now, how'd it go?

03:48.362 --> 03:50.295
How did what?

03:50.297 --> 03:51.363
Come on.

03:51.365 --> 03:53.832
Oh... it was fun.

03:53.834 --> 03:55.000
"It was fun."
That's it?

03:55.002 --> 03:56.285
"It was fun."

03:56.286 --> 03:57.569
It was<i> The Lion King. </i>
What do you want me to say?

03:57.571 --> 03:59.271
You like this girl, or what?

03:59.273 --> 04:01.540
You know what?
Tell you what.

04:01.542 --> 04:03.242
Here's an idea.

04:03.243 --> 04:04.943
You and me, after we're done
with the hormone therapy,

04:04.945 --> 04:06.378
we go
into the little ladies' room,

04:06.380 --> 04:07.879
and I'll tell you all about it,

04:07.881 --> 04:10.782
all right?
That's funny stuff.
That's funny stuff.

04:10.784 --> 04:12.684
I'll just go grab my purse.
I'll be back.

04:12.686 --> 04:14.253
Okay.

04:14.255 --> 04:15.787
Hey, Eddie.

04:17.992 --> 04:20.726
She's great.

04:20.728 --> 04:21.827
Yeah?

04:21.829 --> 04:24.496
Yeah.

04:24.498 --> 04:27.599
But, um... I told her

04:27.601 --> 04:29.901
that we should probably
take a little break.

04:29.903 --> 04:31.270
Why?

04:31.272 --> 04:33.472
Because there's a kid
involved, Ed.

04:33.474 --> 04:35.007
You love kids.

04:35.009 --> 04:36.541
Yeah, I know.

04:36.543 --> 04:39.444
You don't mess around
when there's a kid involved.

04:39.446 --> 04:40.912
Not unless you're sure
how you feel.

04:40.914 --> 04:42.247
That's ridiculous.

04:42.248 --> 04:43.581
How else are you going
to figure out how you feel

04:43.584 --> 04:45.651
if you don't spend time
together?

04:45.652 --> 04:47.719
All right, thank you.
Thank you very much.

04:48.689 --> 04:49.988
All right, whatever.

04:49.990 --> 04:53.025
Yeah.

05:07.875 --> 05:09.574
(digital beeping)

05:27.594 --> 05:28.660
You get what we need.

05:28.662 --> 05:30.829
All right, I got this.

05:37.438 --> 05:38.437
(speaking Russian)

05:38.439 --> 05:39.938
I've changed my mind.

05:39.940 --> 05:42.741
What?
I don't want you
to do this. Misha!

05:47.581 --> 05:48.947
These are good people.

05:48.949 --> 05:49.948
They trust me.

05:49.950 --> 05:51.383
I don't want to steal from them.

05:52.953 --> 05:56.088
Misha!

05:56.090 --> 05:57.756
Just listen to me.

05:57.758 --> 06:00.726
They are coming back.

06:00.728 --> 06:02.627
What time?

06:02.629 --> 06:04.896
Uh... 1:30.

06:08.669 --> 06:10.502
That gives us more than an hour.

06:10.504 --> 06:12.971
No, I need you to go now.

06:12.973 --> 06:14.506
Stop!

06:14.508 --> 06:16.041
This is not your decision.

06:23.817 --> 06:26.718
Oh, Misha...

06:26.720 --> 06:28.720
This is not right.

06:28.722 --> 06:30.489
Is it right
that your boy has no mama?

06:31.759 --> 06:34.693
This is why you do this, yes?

06:34.695 --> 06:36.027
For Leo.

06:36.029 --> 06:37.562
Yes, of course, but...

06:37.564 --> 06:38.997
They have a lot.

06:38.999 --> 06:40.732
We take tiny bit.

06:40.734 --> 06:42.834
With your share,
you can go home,

06:42.836 --> 06:44.536
get your boy, bring him back.

06:44.538 --> 06:46.605
(speaking Russian)

06:47.574 --> 06:49.674
I want to meet him very much.

06:52.780 --> 06:56.581
I know he is beautiful
like his mama.

06:56.583 --> 06:58.417
(sighs)

06:58.419 --> 07:02.854
A child is most beautiful thing
in the world.

07:02.856 --> 07:04.055
Am I right?

07:06.460 --> 07:08.727
Good.

07:08.729 --> 07:10.796
Good girl.

07:10.798 --> 07:13.932
But you have to be gone
when they come back.

07:13.934 --> 07:15.734
Yes, yes... go.

07:15.736 --> 07:17.436
Go.

07:17.438 --> 07:19.104
Don't forget.

07:19.106 --> 07:20.906
Close gate when you go.

07:26.680 --> 07:28.747

Irina, I'm really glad
I caught you.

07:42.563 --> 07:44.162
Uh, Mr. Sabiston,
I'm just leaving.

07:44.164 --> 07:46.631
I know you said you couldn't
stay, but I'm in a jam.

07:46.633 --> 07:48.467
Not enough players showed up
for the game,

07:48.469 --> 07:49.701
so Dennis is bringing
the kids home.

07:49.703 --> 07:50.769
What?

07:55.576 --> 07:57.676
She going to be cool?

07:57.678 --> 08:00.111
Your girlfriend, I mean.

08:00.113 --> 08:03.215
Don't worry.

08:03.217 --> 08:05.817

08:12.693 --> 08:14.693
DANIEL:
You should
have seen it.

08:14.695 --> 08:16.828
Four guys-- that's all they had.

08:16.830 --> 08:18.697
What a bunch of losers.

08:18.699 --> 08:21.132
They just completely
wasted my time.

08:21.134 --> 08:22.634
Hey, you're Irina?

08:22.636 --> 08:24.135
Yes, hello.

08:24.137 --> 08:25.737
Hi, Ted asked me
to drop the kids.

08:25.739 --> 08:26.805
So, that's what you do?

08:26.807 --> 08:27.806
You just drop them?

08:27.808 --> 08:29.140
What if I am not here?

08:30.110 --> 08:31.810
But you are.

08:31.812 --> 08:33.979
I mean...

08:33.981 --> 08:36.081
Okay, so where can we go?

08:36.083 --> 08:37.549
Just the...
just the three of us.

08:37.551 --> 08:38.517
JENNIFER:
Go where?

08:38.519 --> 08:40.219
We'll go to the mall.

08:40.220 --> 08:41.920
DANIEL:
I just got to get a drink.
Daniel...

08:41.922 --> 08:43.655
I'll be like two minutes.
Daniel, no.

08:43.657 --> 08:44.689
Is everything okay?

08:44.691 --> 08:46.024
Yes, of course.
Irina, I have

08:46.026 --> 08:47.125
to go to the bathroom.

08:47.127 --> 08:48.727
But, uh...
You sure?

08:48.729 --> 08:50.095
Yes, thank you.

08:50.097 --> 08:51.796
I'll be like two minutes, okay?

09:03.010 --> 09:05.010
It's a gun, a... a pistol.

09:05.012 --> 09:06.912
Something
is definitely off here.

09:06.914 --> 09:07.946

Sir, what's your location?

09:07.948 --> 09:09.714

09:13.186 --> 09:15.720
Uh, 2428?

09:21.028 --> 09:22.227
Just get them out.

09:22.229 --> 09:23.828
No, you have
to leave.
What?

09:23.830 --> 09:24.863
You have to leave.
Right now.

09:24.865 --> 09:26.932
Get them out.

09:31.872 --> 09:34.139
(gasps)

09:34.141 --> 09:36.875
(siren blaring in distance)

09:37.844 --> 09:38.910
Who is he?

09:38.912 --> 09:41.046
He called the police.

09:42.082 --> 09:43.949
(siren approaching)

09:46.119 --> 09:47.118
(gasps)
Stop!

09:47.120 --> 09:49.187
No, don't!

09:56.163 --> 09:57.329
Help!

09:57.331 --> 09:59.297
Hey, hold it!

09:59.299 --> 10:00.632
Stop right there.
Let me go.

10:00.634 --> 10:02.000
Let me...

10:08.008 --> 10:10.108
I need backup:
2428 Mathers Crescent.

10:10.110 --> 10:11.643
Suspect is armed.

10:11.645 --> 10:12.777
It's okay, sweetheart.

10:12.779 --> 10:13.812
It's okay, sweetheart.
DANIEL:
No!

10:13.814 --> 10:14.980
Just let me go!

10:14.982 --> 10:16.047
Upstairs-- take them.

10:16.049 --> 10:17.566
Daniel!

10:17.567 --> 10:19.084
Just listen to me...
listen to me.

10:27.094 --> 10:29.928
Any more trouble,
I kill.

10:29.930 --> 10:32.163
Upstairs.

10:32.165 --> 10:34.666
Upstairs!

10:34.668 --> 10:36.968
You two,
take him upstairs.

11:40.901 --> 11:43.835
And we've got at least one
gunman, probably more.

11:43.837 --> 11:45.470
PARKER:
Any idea
who they are?

11:45.472 --> 11:46.971
Well, a white male,

11:46.973 --> 11:49.007
30s, jeans, work boots,
maybe a tool belt.

11:49.009 --> 11:50.975
Beyond that,
we don't know anything

11:50.977 --> 11:53.978
about 'em.
Beyond the fact that they got
through the security system.

11:53.980 --> 11:56.181
And when they got inside,
they reactivated it.

11:56.183 --> 11:59.017
Which means they're smart
or else they got...
They got friends.

11:59.019 --> 12:02.420
All right, we'll check
the perimeter.

12:02.422 --> 12:04.055
Donna, Alpha, with me.

12:04.057 --> 12:05.390
Sam, Wordy, Bravo.

12:05.392 --> 12:07.492
PARKER:
Lew, you're
my second today.

12:07.494 --> 12:10.128
Copy that.

12:10.130 --> 12:13.198
1:33 p.m. Armed home invasion.
Hostages.

12:13.200 --> 12:15.200
Spike?

12:15.202 --> 12:17.068
PDM Security.

12:17.070 --> 12:19.070
Let's see
what we're up against here.

12:19.072 --> 12:21.406
I'll track that security system
for you.

12:25.979 --> 12:28.313
Okay, Inspector, let's get
a uniform to go door-to-door.

12:28.315 --> 12:30.248
Maybe there's a neighbor
who can tell us something.

12:30.250 --> 12:32.283
Okay.
Eddie, how we doing?

12:32.285 --> 12:33.952
Getting over the fence is easy.

12:33.954 --> 12:35.820
But then we're on<i> Candid Camera.</i>

12:35.822 --> 12:37.756
Can they access the feed

12:37.758 --> 12:38.923
from inside the house?

12:38.925 --> 12:40.925
Well, let's assume they can

12:40.926 --> 12:42.926
'cause if we trip those wires,
all hell breaks loose.

12:42.929 --> 12:44.095
It's your call, boss.

12:44.097 --> 12:45.463
It's too soon to risk.

12:45.465 --> 12:47.465
Not until we know who,
what we're dealing with

12:47.467 --> 12:49.000
and how they'll react.
We got movement,

12:49.002 --> 12:50.502
second floor there.

12:50.504 --> 12:52.137
Eddie, second floor.

12:58.311 --> 13:00.545
Irina,
who are these guys?

13:00.547 --> 13:02.781
What do they want?
I told you

13:02.783 --> 13:03.548
I've never seen
them before.

13:03.550 --> 13:05.049
Tell me what's going...

13:05.051 --> 13:07.385
We got to go.

13:07.387 --> 13:09.187
Did you hear me?
We have to go!

13:09.189 --> 13:10.221
Shut up.

13:10.223 --> 13:11.489
The system's reset.

13:11.491 --> 13:13.224
If they try to come through,
we'll know it.

13:13.226 --> 13:15.226
Good.

13:15.228 --> 13:18.096
How do we get video?

13:18.098 --> 13:19.030
I need to know.

13:21.034 --> 13:22.567
The computer.

13:22.569 --> 13:23.568
Put it on.

13:23.570 --> 13:25.837
Okay, sit, sit.

13:26.973 --> 13:29.040
It's all right.

13:41.555 --> 13:43.822
(siren blaring in distance)

13:45.592 --> 13:48.493
Listen, um...

13:51.464 --> 13:54.132
If you want money...

13:54.134 --> 13:56.301
is that what
you want?

13:56.303 --> 13:58.369
I can pay you.

13:58.371 --> 14:00.839
You know, just tell me
how much you want,

14:00.841 --> 14:02.006
and, uh,

14:02.008 --> 14:03.541
you know, we can make
something work.

14:06.079 --> 14:07.378
He speaks English, right?

14:07.380 --> 14:08.479
I don't know him.

14:08.481 --> 14:10.148
(stammering)

14:10.150 --> 14:11.449
I pay you, huh?

14:11.451 --> 14:13.017
Big money. Okay?

14:22.062 --> 14:25.964
He says he'd like you
to be quiet, please.

14:33.173 --> 14:35.206
Winnie, we find out
who the owners are?

14:35.208 --> 14:37.208
Edward and Valerie Sabiston.

14:37.210 --> 14:38.560
We're trying to locate them.

14:38.561 --> 14:39.911
We have a phone number
for the house?

14:39.913 --> 14:42.480
Coming right up.

14:47.888 --> 14:49.254
<i> Da.</i>

14:57.430 --> 14:59.497
(phone ringing)

15:06.172 --> 15:08.172
Come on.

15:08.174 --> 15:09.674
No, don't go.

15:09.676 --> 15:11.175
It's all right.
It's okay. It's okay.

15:11.177 --> 15:13.244
(ringing continues)

15:14.481 --> 15:16.547
Answer.
You look after her.

15:23.924 --> 15:25.924
Hello?

15:25.926 --> 15:27.592
PARKER:
This is the Police Strategic
Response Unit.

15:27.594 --> 15:28.626
It's the police.

15:28.628 --> 15:30.295
Your English is better.

15:30.297 --> 15:31.629
Hello?
I can't.

15:31.631 --> 15:33.631
I help you.

15:33.633 --> 15:36.367
I tell you what to say.

15:36.369 --> 15:38.369
Hello?

15:38.371 --> 15:40.138
Yes?

15:40.140 --> 15:41.506
Who am I talking to, please?

15:41.508 --> 15:43.508
Irina Kazkov.

15:43.510 --> 15:46.244
I'm just the nanny.

15:46.246 --> 15:47.111
Irina, I'm Greg.

15:47.113 --> 15:48.146
Are you okay?

15:48.148 --> 15:49.480
Yes, I'm okay.

15:49.482 --> 15:52.183
Everyone is okay, but...

15:52.185 --> 15:54.218
they will kill us

15:54.220 --> 15:56.154
if you don't do exactly
what they say.

15:56.156 --> 15:58.189
How many of them are there?
Uh...

15:58.191 --> 16:00.258
there's three of them,

16:00.260 --> 16:02.260
and three hostages--

16:02.262 --> 16:04.495
two children
Daniel and Jennifer,

16:04.497 --> 16:06.164
and then, uh...
no, there's four of us.

16:06.166 --> 16:08.099
There's four of us including me.

16:08.101 --> 16:10.168
Including you?
Then you're a hostage.

16:10.170 --> 16:11.636
Yes.

16:11.638 --> 16:13.171
Can they hear me, Irina?

16:13.173 --> 16:14.639
No.

16:14.641 --> 16:16.140
Do you know who they are?

16:16.142 --> 16:17.642
No, I've never seen them before.

16:17.644 --> 16:19.610
Have they told you anything
about themselves?

16:19.612 --> 16:20.962
No.

16:20.963 --> 16:22.313
I need to speak to one of them.

16:26.419 --> 16:29.053
No, I'm sorry.

16:29.055 --> 16:31.222
Irina, it's very important

16:31.224 --> 16:33.257
that I speak to one of them
directly.

16:33.259 --> 16:37.128
He... he says that they don't
speak English, only Russian.

16:37.130 --> 16:39.197
(speaking Russian)

16:43.269 --> 16:46.270
He says you must leave
and let them out.

16:46.272 --> 16:49.240
That they will take one hostage
with them.

16:49.242 --> 16:50.308
Tell them I'll work on it.

16:50.310 --> 16:51.509
Tell them I'll see
what I can do,

16:51.511 --> 16:53.444
but I right now I need to know

16:53.446 --> 16:55.446
exactly where you are
in the house.

16:55.448 --> 16:58.449
(gasps)

16:58.451 --> 17:00.451
Irina?

17:10.530 --> 17:12.530
You hear the nanny
on the headset?

17:12.532 --> 17:14.465
Yeah. You trust her?

17:14.467 --> 17:16.267
Russian hostage taker,
Russian nanny.

17:16.269 --> 17:17.735
Means she's got
the security code.
Yep.

17:17.737 --> 17:19.337
Is she in on it?

17:19.339 --> 17:21.339
Well, that would be
my first guess, but...

17:21.341 --> 17:23.408
Her fear sounds
real.
Exactly.

17:24.344 --> 17:26.210
Hey, Winnie, let's see
what we can find out

17:26.212 --> 17:28.346
about our nanny,
Irina Kazkov.

17:28.348 --> 17:29.380
K-A-Zed-

17:29.382 --> 17:31.282
WINNIE:
Copy that.
K-O-V.

17:31.284 --> 17:33.418
We got a possible entry, second
garage, side of the house.

17:33.420 --> 17:35.153
That's good.

17:35.155 --> 17:36.821
PARKER:
Spike, what's going on
with the security system?

17:36.823 --> 17:38.322
Could you hold on a minute,
please?

17:38.324 --> 17:40.091
Yeah, boss, I'm talking
to the company right now.

17:40.093 --> 17:41.592
Looks like it's got all
the whistles and bells.

17:41.594 --> 17:42.660
And they got Inferno.

17:42.662 --> 17:43.661
What's Inferno?

17:43.663 --> 17:45.129
It's like a sound bomb.

17:45.131 --> 17:46.330
It paralyzes, but harmless.

17:46.332 --> 17:48.566
Also CCTV, both inside and out.

17:48.568 --> 17:50.234
So we can see inside the rooms?

17:50.236 --> 17:52.270
Not the bedrooms,
but all the common areas.

17:52.272 --> 17:54.338
And I think I can open
the garage door remotely.

17:54.340 --> 17:56.074
Could come in handy.
Yeah, but would
they hear it?

17:56.076 --> 17:57.642
Silent. State-of-the-art
hydraulics.

17:57.644 --> 17:59.544
Can we shut the system down
remotely?

17:59.546 --> 18:00.478
Not a problem.

18:00.480 --> 18:01.479
That's good.

18:01.481 --> 18:02.747
Let's do it on my signal.

18:07.487 --> 18:10.221
Okay, Lew, let's
get the ladders.

18:10.223 --> 18:11.189
Copy that.

18:11.191 --> 18:12.256
Hello, you still there?

18:14.260 --> 18:16.394
Anything moving
out there?

18:16.396 --> 18:17.795
No. Nothing.

18:20.233 --> 18:22.400
Just let the children go.

18:24.437 --> 18:27.405
Why not?

18:28.374 --> 18:30.441
You'll still have him.

18:47.861 --> 18:50.128
(speaking Russian)

18:54.267 --> 18:55.800
What the hell?

18:55.802 --> 18:57.869
What'd you do?
Nothing.

19:22.395 --> 19:24.462
ED:
Boss, we're getting
in position.

19:27.400 --> 19:30.468
Bravo Team, black wall.
We're on white.

19:35.408 --> 19:37.275
Alpha, Bravo, hold position.

19:37.277 --> 19:38.643
Hold.

19:38.645 --> 19:41.712
(speaking Russian)

19:47.620 --> 19:50.655
He says that you have to restore
the video system right away.

19:50.657 --> 19:53.524
And you have to remove
all of your men.

19:53.526 --> 19:55.560
Or they're going
to kill a hostage.

19:55.562 --> 19:58.196
Okay, you tell him we're going
to do this right now.

19:58.198 --> 20:00.264
Alpha, Bravo,

20:00.266 --> 20:01.399
you within camera range?

20:01.401 --> 20:02.733
Negative.

20:02.735 --> 20:04.468
Good. Don't move; don't breathe;

20:04.470 --> 20:05.636
or bad things happen
to hostages.

20:05.638 --> 20:06.671
Understood.

20:06.673 --> 20:08.406
Spike, put the system back up.

20:08.408 --> 20:10.474
Doing it now.

20:11.511 --> 20:12.777
SPIKE:
System's back up.

20:12.779 --> 20:14.745
Copy that.

20:14.747 --> 20:15.780
Irina?

20:15.782 --> 20:18.849
Okay, we've restored the system.

20:20.420 --> 20:22.420
Can you hear me?
Tell him: new rule.

20:22.422 --> 20:24.622
(speaking Russian)

20:24.624 --> 20:25.890
You there?

20:27.560 --> 20:30.561
(speaking Russian)

20:30.563 --> 20:33.564
Every move that you make,
they can see you.

20:33.566 --> 20:35.766
And if you're not gone by 2:00,

20:35.768 --> 20:38.302
that he will kill
the first hostage.

20:38.304 --> 20:40.404
Irina, now I need to speak
with the man in charge,

20:40.406 --> 20:41.439
you hear me?

20:41.441 --> 20:42.573
Sergeant.

20:42.575 --> 20:44.875
Irina?

20:44.877 --> 20:46.944
Irina?

20:55.355 --> 20:56.587
What's up, Inspector?

20:56.589 --> 20:57.888
We got a neighbor here
that knows the nanny.

20:57.890 --> 20:59.257
You want to come
talk to her?

20:59.259 --> 21:02.326
Okay, Team One,
all ears in on this one.

21:02.328 --> 21:04.395
We need to connect
some dots here.

21:05.965 --> 21:07.965
Good afternoon.

21:07.967 --> 21:09.700
Sergeant Greg Parker.

21:09.702 --> 21:11.702
I understand you know the nanny.

21:11.704 --> 21:12.803
Irina?

21:12.805 --> 21:13.938
Yes, she's a sweetie.

21:13.940 --> 21:15.806
I see her at the park
with the kids.

21:15.808 --> 21:17.875
Does she talk
about her personal life?

21:17.877 --> 21:19.877
Well, she has a little boy
in Russia.

21:19.879 --> 21:20.978
He lives with his grandma.

21:20.980 --> 21:23.281
You know, it's hard.
She misses him.

21:23.283 --> 21:24.482
No family here?

21:24.484 --> 21:25.983
None that I know of.

21:25.985 --> 21:27.585
She associate with bad guys?

21:27.587 --> 21:28.586
Any friends?

21:28.588 --> 21:30.855
There is a new guy in her life.

21:30.857 --> 21:33.291
His name's like
a girl's name.

21:33.293 --> 21:36.560
Sasha... Mish... Misha. Misha.

21:36.562 --> 21:38.045
Misha? That's good.

21:38.046 --> 21:39.529
She mention a last name?
Anything else about him?

21:39.532 --> 21:41.832
No, just that he's really nice.

21:41.834 --> 21:42.867
Thank you very much.

21:42.869 --> 21:43.901
Thanks, Inspector.

21:43.903 --> 21:45.536
Is she in the house?

21:45.538 --> 21:46.604
Okay, team, thoughts?

21:46.606 --> 21:48.539
Sounds socially isolated.

21:48.541 --> 21:51.375
She's looking
for a kindred spirit.

21:51.377 --> 21:53.811
Vulnerable to promises
about seeing her boy.

21:53.813 --> 21:56.614
PARKER:
Yeah, this romance sounds
a little strategic to me.

21:58.918 --> 22:00.584
(phone rings)

22:02.622 --> 22:03.688
(speaks Russian)

22:08.561 --> 22:10.094
PARKER:
Irina?

22:10.096 --> 22:11.662
This is Greg again.

22:11.664 --> 22:15.399
He says that you're almost
out of time.

22:15.401 --> 22:18.402
I need you to tell me
about Misha.

22:18.404 --> 22:22.506
(sighs)
Misha? How do you mean?

22:22.508 --> 22:23.708
The man you're dating.

22:23.710 --> 22:25.376
Is he with you right now?

22:25.378 --> 22:27.945
I need to know who he is.

22:27.947 --> 22:29.880
Can you speak safely?

22:29.882 --> 22:32.516
He has a gun.
That's who he is.

22:32.518 --> 22:34.652
And he says
that he will kill one hostage.

22:34.654 --> 22:36.120
Let me talk to him.
Just put him on the phone.

22:36.122 --> 22:38.622
You do not believe me?

22:38.624 --> 22:39.623
Misha?

22:39.625 --> 22:41.559
You think I'm not serious?

22:41.561 --> 22:43.127
Is this Misha?
I told you to leave.

22:43.129 --> 22:44.528
I told you to get out.

22:44.530 --> 22:45.796
Misha, this is Greg Parker.

22:45.798 --> 22:47.248
I'm with the Police...

22:47.249 --> 22:48.699
Hey, hey, no, no! Come on!

22:48.701 --> 22:51.001
Don't, don't touch me!

22:51.003 --> 22:52.436
They got snipers
out there!

22:52.438 --> 22:53.537
Irina!
Misha!

22:53.539 --> 22:54.805
Do what I say!

22:54.807 --> 22:56.674
Let's not do anything
that we can't undo,

22:56.676 --> 22:58.576
because then it will be
difficult for me

22:58.578 --> 23:00.878
to meet your requests, Misha.

23:00.880 --> 23:04.115
I'm very serious
about what you asked for.

23:04.117 --> 23:05.750
That's why it's important
that we talk.

23:05.752 --> 23:09.954
You wanted video back,
I gave you video back.

23:09.956 --> 23:11.822
Now, Misha,

23:11.824 --> 23:14.625
I'm ready to pull my men back
at 2:00 p.m.

23:14.627 --> 23:17.595
if first we can talk about
something you can do for me.

23:17.597 --> 23:18.796
This is your fault.

23:18.798 --> 23:21.532
Misha...

23:21.534 --> 23:22.666
Misha?

23:22.668 --> 23:25.903
Misha?!
(gunshot)

23:25.905 --> 23:26.804
(shrieking)

23:34.580 --> 23:35.446
(siren blaring)

23:39.852 --> 23:41.619
Misha, this is Sergeant Parker.

23:41.621 --> 23:44.054
I need you to tell me
what just happened.

23:45.992 --> 23:48.426
Misha, can you hear me?

23:48.428 --> 23:51.595
Wordy, what's it look like?
We need to know what's on

23:51.597 --> 23:53.097
the other side of the door.

23:57.737 --> 23:59.537
There's no way to get past
that camera.

23:59.539 --> 24:01.605
I need someone
to acknowledge now!

24:01.607 --> 24:03.174
ED:
Boss, we're set to go in.

24:03.176 --> 24:04.542
Your call.

24:04.544 --> 24:06.010
Just hold your positions.

24:06.012 --> 24:07.845
Spike, anything on CCTV?

24:07.847 --> 24:09.847
Nothing, boss.
I got nothing on the cameras.

24:09.849 --> 24:11.432
I got the owner of the van.

24:11.433 --> 24:13.016
Guy named Mears.
Says the van was stolen.

24:13.019 --> 24:15.119
He report it?
Nope.

24:15.121 --> 24:16.454
Okay, let's get a uniform

24:16.456 --> 24:18.155
to pick him up
and bring him here.

24:33.973 --> 24:35.339
Oh, my God.

24:35.340 --> 24:36.706
Spike, we need
to get in there fast

24:36.709 --> 24:38.242
without tipping them off
or we lose the children.

24:38.244 --> 24:40.611
I'm working on it, boss. I just
need a little bit more time.

24:40.613 --> 24:42.046
No, we don't have time!

24:42.048 --> 24:43.814
Copy that.

24:43.816 --> 24:46.550
(cell phone ringing)

24:49.222 --> 24:51.222
Yes.

24:51.224 --> 24:52.957
You understand I am serious now?

24:52.959 --> 24:54.658
I am watching.

24:54.660 --> 24:56.760
If you don't take away
your men,

24:56.762 --> 24:58.128
ten minutes,

24:58.130 --> 25:00.231
I kill little girl.
(children sobbing)

25:07.173 --> 25:10.674
"A child is the most
beautiful thing in the world."

25:10.676 --> 25:12.843
(speaks Russian)

25:12.845 --> 25:14.979
I will not let you touch
these children!

25:14.981 --> 25:17.248
You do what I say!

25:17.250 --> 25:19.550
And I do what I have to.

25:19.552 --> 25:20.551
So do you!

25:20.553 --> 25:21.552
You watch,

25:21.554 --> 25:22.553
you computer.

25:27.226 --> 25:28.659
What's up, Lew?
Guy's sticking
to his story.

25:28.661 --> 25:30.094
He's not talking.

25:30.096 --> 25:31.862
Really?

25:32.999 --> 25:34.598
You know what?
That just seems rude

25:34.600 --> 25:35.566
to me.

25:35.568 --> 25:36.867
Rude,
why am I rude?

25:36.869 --> 25:39.904
Because, Mr. Mears, we've
just had a homicide here

25:39.906 --> 25:42.907
and I'd like to keep other
people from getting killed.

25:42.909 --> 25:46.010
I'd like to keep some kids
from getting killed.

25:46.012 --> 25:47.044
So how about you find

25:47.046 --> 25:48.913
some manners?

25:48.915 --> 25:50.881
How about you start talking
before I start thinking

25:50.883 --> 25:53.851
about other charges to add
on accessory to murder?

25:53.853 --> 25:58.656
W-W-W-Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
okay, okay, okay, okay.

25:58.658 --> 26:00.558
The van wasn't stolen.

26:02.328 --> 26:04.862
No?

26:04.864 --> 26:05.863
No.

26:05.865 --> 26:07.264
I-I loaned it to Cole.

26:07.266 --> 26:08.666
Cole-- is that a first name,
a last name?

26:08.668 --> 26:09.667
What is that?
C-Cole Huysberg--

26:09.669 --> 26:10.985
he's my brother-in-law.

26:10.986 --> 26:12.302
I didn't know
this was going to happen.

26:12.305 --> 26:13.904
How could I...?
Does Cole know
a guy named Misha?

26:13.906 --> 26:15.606
Yeah, he talks about
this Misha guy all the time.

26:15.608 --> 26:17.825
Misha got a last name?

26:17.826 --> 26:20.043
He does... uh, K-Kondrash... uh,
Kachev... Kondra-Kondrashoff,

26:20.046 --> 26:21.278
Kondrashoff.

26:21.280 --> 26:22.646
He's, like, a Russian dude.

26:22.648 --> 26:23.781
He's ex... ex-military
or something.

26:23.783 --> 26:25.716
He, he hangs
with this gang, um...

26:25.718 --> 26:27.651
uh, Chooma, Chooma, I think.

26:27.653 --> 26:29.787
It means "Plague"
or something like that.

26:29.789 --> 26:31.689
Hold on to him.

26:31.691 --> 26:32.823
Okay.
Come on, man.

26:32.825 --> 26:33.958
I'm helping out.

26:33.960 --> 26:35.292
I'm giving you
what you need here.
So...

26:35.294 --> 26:36.727
Kondrashoff is ex-Russian army,

26:36.729 --> 26:38.796
and this is what he does
for a living now.

26:38.798 --> 26:40.297
Winnie, you get anything
on the other two guys?

26:40.299 --> 26:41.732
WINNIE:
The one named Cole
has a record--

26:41.734 --> 26:43.451
small-time stuff mostly.

26:43.452 --> 26:45.169
They're just a couple of guys
he brought in for some muscle.

26:45.171 --> 26:47.004
Maybe.
Well, maybe there's a weak link?

26:47.006 --> 26:48.606
If Kondrashoff is the guy
I'm dealing with,

26:48.608 --> 26:50.608
he's already looking at life
for killing a hostage.

26:50.610 --> 26:51.775
I don't think
he has anything else to lose.

26:51.777 --> 26:53.243
Then we've got
to go in there now.

26:53.245 --> 26:55.112
How long will it take
to get to the second floor?

26:55.114 --> 26:57.648
Maybe 30 seconds.
By which time
both kids are dead.

26:57.650 --> 26:59.016
Guys, there's a way
we can do this.

26:59.018 --> 27:00.250
Talk to me.

27:00.252 --> 27:01.986
Okay, the system's divided
into sectors.

27:01.987 --> 27:03.721
Okay, we can shut them down
one sector at a time,

27:03.723 --> 27:05.289
so as soon as the ninjas
go through sector 1,

27:05.291 --> 27:06.991
we bring it back up,

27:06.992 --> 27:08.692
then we can go to the next
and then we go to the next.

27:08.694 --> 27:10.628
Before they realize
the sector is down?

27:10.630 --> 27:12.029
Well, I'm not asking for theory.
That's the theory.

27:12.031 --> 27:13.397
Can we do it?

27:13.399 --> 27:14.732
Yeah.

27:14.734 --> 27:16.233
Theoretically.
(scoffs)

27:16.235 --> 27:17.724
Eddie?

27:17.725 --> 27:19.214
ED:
We're at the garage entrance,
white wall.

27:19.215 --> 27:20.704
How many sectors
between us and the bad guys?

27:20.706 --> 27:21.705
Three.

27:21.707 --> 27:23.007
We're the owners
of the home.

27:23.009 --> 27:24.008
What's going on?

27:24.010 --> 27:25.009
Let's go now.

27:25.011 --> 27:26.810
Bringing down sector 1.

27:26.812 --> 27:29.346
Repeat:
bringing down sector 1.

27:29.348 --> 27:32.850
Okay, Spike... open the door.

27:32.852 --> 27:34.918
Copy that.

27:42.261 --> 27:44.828
We're in.

27:45.865 --> 27:47.665
The hell?

27:47.667 --> 27:48.866
What?

27:48.868 --> 27:50.834
I thought...

27:50.836 --> 27:54.772
It's nothing. It's okay.

27:58.811 --> 28:00.778
(lock clicks)

28:12.858 --> 28:14.858
We're in the gym.

28:14.860 --> 28:18.028
Okay, sector 2 starts
just outside the gym.

28:18.030 --> 28:20.364
I want you to go inside
and take the stairs.

28:20.366 --> 28:22.866
Stop at the bottom
and I'll start sector 3.

28:22.868 --> 28:24.935
Copy that.

28:31.010 --> 28:32.710
I'm bringing down sector 2.

28:42.388 --> 28:45.155
We're at the bottom
of the stairs.

28:45.157 --> 28:46.824
Copy that.

28:46.826 --> 28:48.025
Bringing down sector 3.

28:48.027 --> 28:50.928
On your call.
Sector 2 camera active;

28:50.930 --> 28:52.429
stay out of range.

28:52.431 --> 28:56.767
(Irina singing in Russian)

29:02.475 --> 29:04.341
Misha, listen, that guy--

29:04.343 --> 29:05.509
that was bad news,

29:05.511 --> 29:08.479
really bad.

29:08.481 --> 29:10.197
For God's sake, two kids?

29:10.198 --> 29:11.914
You want to go to jail
for the rest of your life?

29:11.917 --> 29:13.517
I didn't kill anybody.
You were here.

29:13.519 --> 29:14.918
Look, whatever's happening,

29:14.920 --> 29:17.087
Irina is not a part of it.

29:17.089 --> 29:18.088
I know it.

29:18.090 --> 29:19.356
She would never hurt
the children.

29:19.358 --> 29:20.357
Are you sure?

29:20.359 --> 29:22.192
Of course I'm sure.

29:22.194 --> 29:23.894
They're my<i> children.</i>

29:23.896 --> 29:25.395
I see the way she cares
for them,

29:25.397 --> 29:26.396
the way she talks
to them.

29:26.398 --> 29:27.798
For God's sakes,

29:27.800 --> 29:29.466
you have to get our kids
out of there.

29:29.468 --> 29:30.934
Irina has a son
back in Russia.

29:30.936 --> 29:32.369
What's the boy's name?
What the hell

29:32.371 --> 29:34.772
does that have
to do with anything?
Mrs. Sabiston...

29:34.774 --> 29:36.507
what's the boy's name?

29:36.509 --> 29:38.909
Yes, it's Leo.

29:38.911 --> 29:41.078
Does Irina have a cell phone?

29:41.080 --> 29:42.479
TED:
Yeah, we gave her one.

29:42.481 --> 29:43.814
Why?

29:43.816 --> 29:45.449
It's been ten minutes.

29:45.451 --> 29:47.785
They still don't listen.

29:47.786 --> 29:50.120
Okay, uniforms and detectives,
let's pull out.

29:50.122 --> 29:51.455
Pull out.

29:51.457 --> 29:53.891
Inspector.

29:53.893 --> 29:54.925
We need to sell this.

29:54.927 --> 29:56.226
We need to get everybody
out of here.

29:56.228 --> 29:57.227
Okay, all right.

29:57.229 --> 29:59.897
Everybody,
clear out now.

29:59.899 --> 30:01.865
COLE:
They're not gonna let us out
of here, you know that, right?

30:01.867 --> 30:02.966
MISHA:
I know they don't want
dead children.

30:04.837 --> 30:06.503
COLE:
They never give in
to hostage-takers.

30:06.505 --> 30:10.040
MISHA:
That's what they want you
to think.

30:10.042 --> 30:11.041
Yes?

30:11.043 --> 30:13.110
Irina, this is Greg.

30:13.112 --> 30:15.979
I need you to listen to me
very carefully.

30:15.981 --> 30:17.414
I know about your son.

30:17.416 --> 30:18.448
What?

30:18.450 --> 30:19.917
And I know
this wasn't your fault,

30:19.919 --> 30:21.451
but I need you to trust me.

30:21.453 --> 30:23.120
What does he say?

30:23.122 --> 30:25.989
He says
that they need more time.

30:25.991 --> 30:27.324
See what I'm saying? They're
just going to keep stalling.

30:27.326 --> 30:28.959
Misha, he's right.
We got to let these kids...

30:28.961 --> 30:30.227
Shut up!

30:30.229 --> 30:31.595
Tell him no more time.

30:31.597 --> 30:34.298
He says no more time,
that he'll kill the children.

30:34.300 --> 30:35.833
Okay, have him look
out the window.

30:35.835 --> 30:37.868
Have him do it right now.

30:37.870 --> 30:39.303
See this?
Does he see this?

30:39.305 --> 30:40.904
We're pulling out.

30:40.906 --> 30:43.073
We're getting out of here.
We're clearing the area.

30:43.075 --> 30:45.309
Okay?

30:45.311 --> 30:46.410
What?

30:46.412 --> 30:48.545
They give in.
They are leaving.

30:48.547 --> 30:50.414
They say that they
will listen to you.

30:55.855 --> 30:57.955
It's true: they're leaving.

30:57.957 --> 30:59.389
We're getting out.

31:08.000 --> 31:11.068
(siren blaring)

31:11.070 --> 31:14.504
See, they don't
have the stomach.

31:17.009 --> 31:18.976
Does he see this?
We're leaving.

31:18.978 --> 31:20.577
Pulling everybody out.

31:20.579 --> 31:24.147
Clearing the area.

31:24.149 --> 31:25.215
Is he seeing this?

31:25.217 --> 31:26.984
Yes, they see.
They see.

31:26.986 --> 31:29.019
Now, you need to know that
we're not going anywhere, Irina.

31:29.021 --> 31:30.654
We're coming in there
and we're going to help you

31:30.656 --> 31:32.222
and we're going
to help the children,

31:32.224 --> 31:35.058
but I need you to trust me
for Leo's sake.

31:35.060 --> 31:37.127
For Leo?

31:37.129 --> 31:39.329
I know about Leo.

31:39.331 --> 31:40.364
I know a lot about you.

31:40.366 --> 31:41.632
I think
that you're a good person

31:41.634 --> 31:43.600
and that you never intended
on this happening.

31:43.602 --> 31:47.004
Now, I can't bring Leo to you,
but I know how I can help you.

31:47.006 --> 31:49.006
(sobbing)

31:49.008 --> 31:51.642
Are you there?

31:51.644 --> 31:53.076
I'm here.

31:53.078 --> 31:55.012
Okay, good.

31:55.014 --> 31:58.682
Irina, just, just say yes
if you're willing to trust me.

31:59.652 --> 32:02.052
Yes.

32:17.269 --> 32:18.969
PARKER:
Okay, we're going
to work together.

32:18.971 --> 32:20.971
We're going
to get through this, okay?

32:20.973 --> 32:22.139
I promise.

32:22.141 --> 32:23.440
Okay.

32:23.442 --> 32:25.075
Okay, what?
(sighs)

32:25.077 --> 32:26.510
Okay, what?

32:26.512 --> 32:28.445
IRINA:
I just said

32:28.447 --> 32:30.213
that everyone is okay.

32:30.215 --> 32:31.048
Is that Misha?

32:31.050 --> 32:32.215
Yes.

32:32.217 --> 32:33.550
Yes, he's looking right at me.

32:33.552 --> 32:35.285
He's very serious.
You know this.

32:35.287 --> 32:38.088
Okay, just try and stay calm.

32:38.090 --> 32:39.356
We just need another minute.

32:39.358 --> 32:41.291
What does he say?
Uh....

32:41.293 --> 32:43.427
He says that he...

32:43.429 --> 32:45.429
Tell him we're working on

32:45.431 --> 32:47.631
a safe way
to get him out of there.

32:47.633 --> 32:49.066
An airplane.

32:49.068 --> 32:50.567
A helic... A helicopter.

32:50.569 --> 32:52.202
Uh, a helicopter.

32:52.204 --> 32:54.204
He said that he is
sending a-a helicopter.

32:54.206 --> 32:55.639
It will
be here...
What?

32:55.641 --> 32:58.208
Just tell him
we'll do everything he says.

32:58.210 --> 32:59.276
They did it for you.

32:59.278 --> 33:00.577
You win.

33:05.317 --> 33:07.117
See? I told you.

33:07.119 --> 33:08.452
In position.

33:08.454 --> 33:10.287
Copy that.

33:10.289 --> 33:13.123
Irina, now
this is very important.

33:13.125 --> 33:16.293
I need you and the children
to get back against the wall

33:16.295 --> 33:19.062
now.

33:19.064 --> 33:20.330
What's happening?

33:20.332 --> 33:22.132
Nothing. They are gone.

33:23.369 --> 33:25.469
Can you tell me
exactly where you are?

33:25.471 --> 33:28.138
We are at the south wall,
I think.

33:28.140 --> 33:29.239
South wall?

33:29.241 --> 33:30.507
Yes.

33:30.509 --> 33:32.376
By-By the windows.

33:32.378 --> 33:33.577
Can you tell me
where the gunmen are?

33:33.579 --> 33:36.079
I don't know.
They keep moving around.

33:36.081 --> 33:37.280
Okay, that's fine. That's fine.

33:37.282 --> 33:39.316
Hostages are up
against the south wall.

33:39.318 --> 33:41.418
We can only guess
where the gunmen are.

33:41.420 --> 33:43.587
Spike, shut down sector 3.

33:43.589 --> 33:45.255
Copy that.

33:50.763 --> 33:52.329
SPIKE:
Listen up, guys,
when Inferno goes off,

33:52.331 --> 33:53.497
it's gonna sound
like the end of the world.

33:53.499 --> 33:55.265
Make sure
you got your earplugs in.

33:55.267 --> 33:57.200
Earplugs.

33:58.737 --> 34:01.438
Okay, open the outside gates
when you trigger Inferno, Spike.

34:01.440 --> 34:02.672
Copy that.

34:02.674 --> 34:04.558
Irina?

34:04.559 --> 34:06.443
Irina, you're about
to hear a very loud alarm.

34:06.445 --> 34:08.278
It's a security feature
of the house.

34:08.280 --> 34:09.579
Now,

34:09.581 --> 34:11.314
it's gonna be so loud...
(child mumbles)

34:11.316 --> 34:12.682
...that it's gonna make

34:12.684 --> 34:14.684
the gunmen not be able to think.
It's gonna be a shock

34:14.686 --> 34:16.686
to their brain,
but it's harmless.

34:16.688 --> 34:17.721
It's harmless.

34:17.723 --> 34:18.822
Shh. Go...

34:18.824 --> 34:21.008
But to keep you safe,
I need you

34:21.009 --> 34:23.193
and the children to stay
right up against the south wall

34:23.195 --> 34:25.095
and don't move.

34:27.433 --> 34:29.666
Where are you going?

34:30.736 --> 34:33.036
Cell phone.

34:33.037 --> 34:35.337
Remember. Remember,
just stay up against the wall.

34:35.340 --> 34:36.840
No.

34:36.842 --> 34:39.476
He call you on cell phone
so no one can hear?

34:39.478 --> 34:41.211
No, of course not.

34:41.213 --> 34:42.245
She's selling us out.

34:42.247 --> 34:45.749
Donna? Sam, shields.

34:45.751 --> 34:48.385
IRINA:
No.

34:48.387 --> 34:49.786
(voice breaking):
No. I... I...

34:49.788 --> 34:51.121
You betraying me?

34:51.123 --> 34:52.089
No.

34:53.092 --> 34:54.758
IRINA:
No.

34:54.760 --> 34:56.126
I wouldn't do that.

34:56.128 --> 34:57.761
The kids.

34:57.763 --> 34:59.396
No, Misha!
No! Listen.
(children screaming)

34:59.398 --> 35:01.465
Leave them alone.
Leave them alone.
Out of my way.

35:01.467 --> 35:03.867
Out of my way.
I will not let you
touch the children!

35:05.804 --> 35:06.670
(gunshot)

35:06.672 --> 35:08.305
(screams)

35:08.307 --> 35:10.740
DANIEL:
Irina?

35:10.742 --> 35:12.809
ED:
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

35:12.811 --> 35:15.679
(alarm blaring loudly)

35:27.826 --> 35:30.193
(glass tinkles)

35:44.176 --> 35:45.408
Irina?!

35:45.410 --> 35:46.877
We're here
to help you, okay?

35:46.879 --> 35:48.545
Come here.
No.

35:48.547 --> 35:49.880
(sobbing)

35:50.849 --> 35:52.616
All right, we need paramedics
in here.

35:52.618 --> 35:53.884
We got a gunshot wound.

35:53.886 --> 35:56.219
Come on!
We need medics right away.

35:56.889 --> 35:58.421
(grunting)

35:58.423 --> 36:00.190
Let me go.

36:00.192 --> 36:01.591
Misha?

36:01.593 --> 36:04.227
Find a shot. He's got the boy.
He's got the boy!

36:04.229 --> 36:05.395
He went up!

36:05.397 --> 36:06.830
Copy that.

36:06.832 --> 36:09.266
Donna?

36:09.268 --> 36:10.467
Get to the other stairs.

36:10.469 --> 36:12.235
We need him contained.

36:20.312 --> 36:22.345
(yelps)

36:22.347 --> 36:23.847
One more step, and I kill him!

36:29.721 --> 36:32.189
You leave now!
Just calm down. Nobody else
needs to get hurt here.

36:32.191 --> 36:33.890
You leave!
Oh, let go!

36:33.892 --> 36:35.892
Misha, this is
Greg Parker.

36:35.894 --> 36:37.194
I spoke with you
on the phone.

36:37.196 --> 36:38.628
No, it's time to
put the gun down.

36:38.630 --> 36:40.263
It's time to
let the boy go.

36:40.265 --> 36:41.464
You think I'm stupid?
Because I'm Russian,

36:41.466 --> 36:42.632
you think I'm stupid?

36:42.634 --> 36:44.634
No, I don't
think that.

36:44.636 --> 36:46.369
That's why you're going
to put the gun down.

36:46.371 --> 36:47.804
(Misha speaking Russian)

36:47.806 --> 36:49.839
Misha, listen to me.

36:49.841 --> 36:52.542
I don't want
anyone else to die

36:52.544 --> 36:54.811
today, and that
includes you.

36:54.813 --> 36:57.347
But right now, I'm
you're only chance.

36:57.349 --> 36:59.683
(Misha speaking Russian)

36:59.685 --> 37:01.518
(speaking Russian)

37:01.520 --> 37:03.620
Ed? No solution.

37:03.622 --> 37:04.854
Donna?

37:04.856 --> 37:06.556
No joy.

37:08.560 --> 37:10.560
Get him out in the open.
Let's get him out in the open.

37:10.562 --> 37:12.462
All right, move.

37:12.464 --> 37:14.698
Don't move!
Okay, we're just
gonna stay right here.

37:14.700 --> 37:16.183
Stay right here.

37:16.184 --> 37:17.667
Let me go.
I know what
you're doing.

37:17.669 --> 37:20.537
Okay. Misha, I'm going
to put my gun down.

37:20.539 --> 37:22.472
All right?

37:22.474 --> 37:23.607
No good.

37:23.609 --> 37:24.841
Yeah, listen to me.

37:24.843 --> 37:27.544
Put my gun down.
Put my gun away.

37:27.546 --> 37:29.546
I'm telling you the truth.

37:29.548 --> 37:32.282
Over here. See?

37:32.284 --> 37:33.550
I'm coming out.

37:33.552 --> 37:34.718
I'm coming out.

37:34.720 --> 37:37.787
Jail for the rest
of my life?

37:40.492 --> 37:43.393
PARKER:
I'm not lying to you.
I'm not lying to you.

37:43.395 --> 37:45.328
You don't want
to hurt the boy.
(sobbing)

37:45.330 --> 37:47.697
Misha, you don't want
to hurt the boy.

37:47.699 --> 37:49.733
Is over.
Please.

37:49.735 --> 37:51.768
You don't want to hurt the boy.

37:51.770 --> 37:53.937
You don't want
to hurt the boy.

37:58.844 --> 38:01.044
(gunshots, Daniel screams)

38:01.046 --> 38:03.380
Daniel, right here.

38:03.382 --> 38:05.815
Hey, it's okay, buddy.

38:05.817 --> 38:06.916
We're gonna go
see Mom and Dad.

38:06.918 --> 38:08.351
Gonna go see
Mom and Dad.

38:13.492 --> 38:14.658
(sobbing)

38:14.660 --> 38:16.326
You okay? Huh?

38:16.328 --> 38:17.827
You're all right.

38:17.829 --> 38:19.829
You're safe now.

38:19.831 --> 38:21.898
(sobbing)

38:22.834 --> 38:24.000
(siren blaring)

38:24.002 --> 38:26.002
PARKER:
It's okay.
It's okay. It's okay...

38:26.004 --> 38:27.570
(sighs)

38:27.572 --> 38:29.739
(siren chirps)

38:29.741 --> 38:31.808

39:01.773 --> 39:03.840
¶ ¶

39:25.897 --> 39:27.931
Eddy.

39:27.933 --> 39:29.399
You doing okay?

39:29.401 --> 39:30.567
I'm okay.

39:30.569 --> 39:31.835
Are you okay?

39:35.707 --> 39:37.874
My mistake was
that I wanted Misha to talk.

39:37.876 --> 39:39.809
To try to get him to talk.

39:39.811 --> 39:41.778
Try to get him
to give something back,

39:41.780 --> 39:43.480
but that's what set him off.

39:43.482 --> 39:45.882
Made him kill Dennis Milford.

39:47.953 --> 39:50.387
You know, he thought
I wasn't taking him seriously.

39:52.157 --> 39:54.891
You took him seriously, Greg.

39:56.828 --> 39:59.896
We all took him seriously.

40:05.470 --> 40:06.870
Greg, you're the guy

40:06.872 --> 40:09.539
that tells everybody on this
team, just do your best.

40:09.541 --> 40:10.840
Just do your best.

40:10.842 --> 40:12.909
That's all you can do.

40:13.845 --> 40:15.712
You know something?

40:15.714 --> 40:17.881
Your best is better than most.

40:19.851 --> 40:21.785
Thanks.

40:24.790 --> 40:26.956
(sighs)

40:26.958 --> 40:28.958
So, why don't you...

40:28.960 --> 40:31.094
Why don't you go out
with-with Sylvia again?

40:31.096 --> 40:34.664
Take-Take... Take 'em both
skating or something.

40:34.666 --> 40:36.766
Eddy, come on.

40:36.768 --> 40:38.001
Hey, come on, Greg.

40:38.003 --> 40:40.003
It's... It's
been nine years.

40:40.005 --> 40:41.805
Do the math.
Nine years.

40:41.807 --> 40:43.840
(sighs)

40:43.842 --> 40:44.874
You know...

40:44.876 --> 40:46.609
(laughs)

40:46.611 --> 40:49.012
You know what?

40:50.449 --> 40:52.982
When I went to Dallas
to see my boy,

40:52.984 --> 40:54.017
to reconnect with him...

40:54.019 --> 40:55.919
Yeah?

40:55.921 --> 40:58.922
(sighs):
Ah, geez.

40:58.924 --> 41:01.024
I never got
through the front door.

41:01.026 --> 41:03.092
I never got to see him.

41:04.162 --> 41:06.563
He wouldn't come out.

41:08.967 --> 41:11.501
So, how am I supposed
to call Sylvia

41:11.503 --> 41:14.704
and go skating with her boy

41:14.706 --> 41:17.941
when that's hanging over me?
