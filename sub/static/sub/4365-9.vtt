Previously on
<i>Suits...</i>

00:01.504 --> 00:02.968
I'm bonding
with your father here.

00:02.969 --> 00:04.661
- Speaking of which--
- You're not taking it easy

00:04.662 --> 00:05.792
on me, are you?
A little.

00:06.051 --> 00:07.351
You mean something to me.

00:07.419 --> 00:09.270
You've always meant something
to me

00:09.354 --> 00:12.140
and you always will mean
something to me.

00:12.224 --> 00:14.442
What do you need, Harvey?

00:14.526 --> 00:16.059
Ava Hessington.

00:16.111 --> 00:17.945
I am not losing to him.

00:18.030 --> 00:19.197
You.

00:19.264 --> 00:22.066
Your blood feud
or whatever it is

00:22.117 --> 00:24.067
you have with that man
is what put the target

00:24.092 --> 00:25.546
on my back in the first place.

00:25.571 --> 00:28.295
I made this mess.
It's up to me to clear it up.

00:28.969 --> 00:31.300
Harvey and Cameron made a deal
to take you down.

00:31.318 --> 00:34.032
And part of that deal
was that I got to be the one

00:34.033 --> 00:35.200
to tell you about it.

00:35.284 --> 00:36.845
If he can't practice law
in the country,

00:36.852 --> 00:38.132
he can't be a member
of our firm.

00:38.187 --> 00:39.788
You set this whole thing up.

00:39.855 --> 00:41.823
Jessica set
this whole thing up.

00:41.874 --> 00:44.525
And, Edward,
we may be getting a divorce,

00:44.577 --> 00:47.128
but I fully intend on keeping
ownership of the house.

01:01.727 --> 01:03.728
Oh, come on, just because
I have to wake up early

01:03.813 --> 01:05.230
doesn't mean you
should suffer.

01:05.313 --> 01:06.435
Well, you know
what they say.

01:06.482 --> 01:08.549
The couple
that wakes together...

01:08.601 --> 01:10.985
Bakes together?

01:11.053 --> 01:14.055
- Stays together.
- Yeah, that doesn't rhyme.

01:14.106 --> 01:16.241
You're ridiculous.

01:18.911 --> 01:20.895
Oh, my God.
That's amazing.

01:20.946 --> 01:22.563
I know.

01:22.615 --> 01:23.832
You're amazing.

01:23.899 --> 01:25.834
I know.

01:31.540 --> 01:34.459
You have no intention of
letting me go to work, do you?

01:34.543 --> 01:39.380
There once was a girl
from Nantucket.

01:39.432 --> 01:42.217
I love you.

01:42.268 --> 01:43.584
Oh, that doesn't rhyme,
you know?

01:43.636 --> 01:44.936
What are you,
the rhyming police now?

01:45.020 --> 01:47.305
- You started it.
- And I'm gonna finish it.

01:47.389 --> 01:49.691
I love you too.

02:00.820 --> 02:02.320
You look happier
than you did last night.

02:02.404 --> 02:04.322
I am.

02:06.375 --> 02:07.575
What are you doing here?

02:07.626 --> 02:09.377
I was thinking
I'd give you a ride.

02:09.443 --> 02:10.912
You just gave me a ride
last night.

02:10.963 --> 02:13.331
Yeah, this time
I thought I'd join you.

02:13.415 --> 02:15.616
Harvey,
we put in 15-hour days

02:15.668 --> 02:16.801
12 feet from each other.

02:16.886 --> 02:18.406
You really want
to go to work together?

02:18.453 --> 02:20.121
Who said anything
about work?

02:20.172 --> 02:21.506
We have breakfast
at Nougatine

02:21.590 --> 02:23.675
and an excursion to Hermes
that may or may not

02:23.759 --> 02:25.459
involve a new handbag.

02:25.511 --> 02:27.729
You've been needing
a new handbag.

02:27.796 --> 02:29.463
You can never have
too many handbags.

02:29.515 --> 02:30.836
You're a woman
after my own heart.

02:30.850 --> 02:32.684
Well, in that case...

02:35.637 --> 02:40.108
Harvey...
Why are you doing this?

02:40.159 --> 02:42.660
Donna, we've all
been through a lot.

02:42.745 --> 02:45.497
We deserve
a little celebration.

02:45.581 --> 02:48.533
Well, in that case,
you have had it pretty rough.

02:48.617 --> 02:50.835
We're gonna need to get you
more than one handbag.

02:50.920 --> 02:54.672
I wouldn't have it
any other way.

03:06.519 --> 03:07.685
Jessica.

03:07.770 --> 03:10.688
Louis, what can I do
for you?

03:10.773 --> 03:12.140
Actually, I'm not here
about me.

03:12.191 --> 03:13.274
I'm here about you.

03:13.342 --> 03:15.860
How so?

03:15.945 --> 03:20.698
Um...

03:20.783 --> 03:22.066
I want to handle
the dissolution.

03:22.151 --> 03:23.785
So this is about you.

03:23.852 --> 03:26.354
No.
Jessica...

03:26.405 --> 03:28.957
I got Ava out
when you wanted her out.

03:29.024 --> 03:30.708
I proved that I will do
whatever it takes.

03:30.793 --> 03:33.194
And what's more,
I know Darby's assets,

03:33.245 --> 03:35.246
and I will get you everything
that you have coming.

03:35.331 --> 03:36.881
I can get everything
I have coming.

03:36.966 --> 03:38.833
Maybe, but after
what Stephen Huntley

03:38.884 --> 03:41.125
and Edward Darby did, you want
to exact a pound of flesh.

03:41.136 --> 03:44.639
You want to kill them both.

03:44.706 --> 03:46.040
What's your point?

03:46.091 --> 03:48.011
My point is, is that you go
into that room angry,

03:48.060 --> 03:50.178
you're gonna have blinders on.

03:50.229 --> 03:52.180
And they're gonna lead you
any way they want you to go.

03:52.231 --> 03:54.182
I get in that room,
I'm cool as a cucumber,

03:54.233 --> 03:57.385
and I will lead whatever way
you want to go.

03:57.436 --> 04:00.221
We just got Edward Darby's
proposed formula

04:00.272 --> 04:01.889
for splitting our assets.

04:06.612 --> 04:08.830
- Son of a bitch.
- I know!

04:08.897 --> 04:10.782
He thinks he can dictate terms
after what he's done?

04:10.866 --> 04:11.899
We need to crush him.

04:11.951 --> 04:13.117
See?
Blinders.

04:13.202 --> 04:14.619
What?

04:14.703 --> 04:17.171
Louis was just suggesting
that he run the negotiations.

04:17.238 --> 04:20.291
Louis also suggested the firm
adopt a badger as a mascot.

04:20.375 --> 04:21.909
The badger is a noble
and fearsome creature,

04:21.961 --> 04:23.795
but that's not the point.
I can beat them.

04:23.879 --> 04:25.129
And the Washington Generals
think they can beat

04:25.214 --> 04:26.598
the Globetrotters,
but they're not even

04:26.682 --> 04:27.915
in the same league.

04:27.967 --> 04:29.300
My father played
for the Washington Generals.

04:29.385 --> 04:30.935
- See?
- So what are you saying?

04:31.020 --> 04:32.470
I'm not in your league?
I'm saying you and I

04:32.554 --> 04:33.921
don't even play the same sport.

04:33.973 --> 04:36.858
Harvey...enough.
And Louis has a point.

04:36.925 --> 04:38.759
You seriously want
to consider this?

04:38.811 --> 04:39.894
This is a joke.

04:39.945 --> 04:42.780
Louis, will you give us
a moment?

04:42.865 --> 04:44.866
Please?

04:47.903 --> 04:50.989
I am not a joke.

04:56.045 --> 04:57.912
You can't do that anymore.

04:57.963 --> 04:59.113
You mean make fun of Louis?

04:59.164 --> 05:00.748
It's one of life's
great pleasures.

05:00.799 --> 05:02.199
When the two of you
were colleagues,

05:02.217 --> 05:04.285
that's fair game,
but you're a name partner now,

05:04.336 --> 05:05.816
and you have to show him
some respect.

05:05.838 --> 05:07.255
I am showing him respect.

05:07.306 --> 05:10.958
I'm being dismissive
to his face.

05:11.010 --> 05:13.428
Harvey, remember Kopelman?

05:13.479 --> 05:15.513
Combovers like that
are hard to forget.

05:15.597 --> 05:18.232
When I first started here,
he and I would fight

05:18.300 --> 05:21.736
like cats and dogs every day,
toe-to-toe.

05:21.803 --> 05:23.071
Then one day
he went too far.

05:23.138 --> 05:25.323
He crossed a line,
and I'd had enough,

05:25.407 --> 05:28.809
and I went in,
and I ripped him up.

05:28.861 --> 05:30.478
You know what I did the day
after Daniel and I

05:30.529 --> 05:32.697
took over the firm?

05:32.781 --> 05:36.984
I went to Kopelman, and I told
him how much I valued him.

05:38.454 --> 05:40.088
Kopelman never voted
against you

05:40.155 --> 05:41.822
the whole time I knew him.

05:41.874 --> 05:43.708
Exactly.

05:43.792 --> 05:45.126
And by the way,
Louis is right.

05:45.177 --> 05:48.296
Jessica, it's one thing for me
to show Louis respect.

05:48.347 --> 05:50.932
But you want to put me
on the sidelines for him?

05:50.999 --> 05:52.383
No.

05:52.468 --> 05:54.769
I'm gonna put him in
at quarterback,

05:54.836 --> 05:57.021
then snap the ball to you.

So let me get this straight.

06:29.129 --> 06:30.561
You want to go after
their clients

06:30.562 --> 06:31.937
so we get to count
those revenues.

06:32.088 --> 06:34.611
Whoever has more revenue
is gonna determine

06:34.612 --> 06:36.279
who gets what at the time
of closing.

06:36.364 --> 06:37.764
Louis locks in
the settlement terms

06:37.815 --> 06:39.316
while we tip the basis
for the settlement.

06:39.400 --> 06:40.817
Exactly.

06:40.902 --> 06:42.819
Some might say that's
negotiating in bad faith.

06:42.904 --> 06:45.706
And I say Darby wasn't above
board when we got married.

06:45.773 --> 06:48.608
Why should we be above board
when we're getting divorced?

06:48.660 --> 06:49.993
And until the settlement
is done,

06:50.078 --> 06:51.118
it's not stealing clients.

06:51.129 --> 06:53.113
It's shifting
the attorney of record.

06:53.164 --> 06:55.215
Wait a minute.

06:55.282 --> 06:57.134
Did you think of this
all by yourself?

06:57.218 --> 06:58.898
Why wouldn't I think of this
all by myself?

06:58.920 --> 07:00.387
It as Jessica, wasn't it?

07:00.454 --> 07:01.972
She thought of it
all by yourself.

07:02.056 --> 07:03.790
The important thing right now
is to decide

07:03.841 --> 07:05.258
which client to go after.

07:05.309 --> 07:06.960
And to avoid my question
about whose idea it was.

07:07.011 --> 07:08.679
- Exactly.
- Okay.

07:08.763 --> 07:11.131
Well, if it's going to affect
the settlement calculations,

07:11.182 --> 07:13.567
we're gonna need a big client
and we're gonna need a big one

07:13.634 --> 07:14.985
who just took a loss.

07:15.069 --> 07:16.903
Not necessarily.

07:16.971 --> 07:19.322
You know who cries hardest
in the Miss America pageant?

07:19.407 --> 07:21.191
- The runner-up.
- The winner...

07:21.275 --> 07:23.243
Because she knows
she can't win again,

07:23.310 --> 07:25.529
and winners always want
to win more.

07:25.613 --> 07:27.698
Yeah.
That's not why they cry.

07:27.782 --> 07:29.700
What's wrong with you?
Stay with me.

07:29.784 --> 07:33.336
What we need is a huge company
that is still looking

07:33.421 --> 07:34.671
to keep the crown.

07:38.676 --> 07:39.843
Samsung.

07:39.927 --> 07:42.095
- Get it going.
- Yeah.

07:42.163 --> 07:43.997
Wait. Do you--
you actually watch

07:44.048 --> 07:45.182
the Miss America pageant?

07:45.266 --> 07:47.017
No, but I've celebrated
with the winner.

07:47.101 --> 07:50.336
- Texas, Florida, New York?
- California.

07:50.388 --> 07:52.689
Now, there's a question
you didn't want to avoid.

07:52.774 --> 07:55.025
Exactly.

07:58.029 --> 07:59.279
You wanted to see me?

07:59.346 --> 08:01.782
- Yes, and it's important.
- What can I do for you?

08:01.849 --> 08:03.984
Adjust the font
on the new business cards?

08:04.035 --> 08:06.203
Order some pens?
I don't know.

08:06.287 --> 08:07.788
If we don't have any pens,

08:07.855 --> 08:09.906
what would you sign
the order with?

08:09.991 --> 08:11.374
What do you want, Jessica?

08:11.459 --> 08:12.709
I was just making
a little joke.

08:12.794 --> 08:14.861
Oh, I thought I was
the only joke around here.

08:14.912 --> 08:18.381
Louis, you are no joke.

08:18.466 --> 08:19.750
And you're right.

08:19.834 --> 08:23.053
You have been on the sidelines
far too long.

08:23.137 --> 08:26.890
I want you to handle
the negotiations.

08:26.974 --> 08:28.391
You won't be sorry.

08:28.476 --> 08:29.593
You want a pound of flesh,

08:29.677 --> 08:30.644
I'm gonna bring you
the whole carcass.

08:30.711 --> 08:31.878
I believe you would,

08:31.929 --> 08:33.230
but I'm going to ask you
to do something else.

08:33.313 --> 08:35.347
- Anything you need.
- I need you to be fair.

08:37.885 --> 08:41.404
- Fair?
- Yes, fair.

08:41.489 --> 08:43.823
- That's one way to go.
- It's <i>the</i> way to go...

08:43.890 --> 08:46.243
Because I need them to think
that we're moving on,

08:46.327 --> 08:48.745
when, in fact,
we're going after their clients.

08:48.830 --> 08:51.564
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

08:51.616 --> 08:53.200
You and Harvey are letting me in
on one of your missions?

08:53.251 --> 08:55.669
This is Litt-tastic.
Louis, calm down.

08:55.736 --> 08:56.870
Calm down?
No!

08:56.921 --> 08:58.338
This is just like
<i>The Great Escape.</i>

08:58.405 --> 08:59.840
You're recruiting me
to go behind enemy lines.

08:59.907 --> 09:01.341
I'm Steve McQueen.

09:01.408 --> 09:02.759
- You know <i>The Great Escape?</i>
- <i>Are you kidding?</i>

09:02.844 --> 09:04.511
Charles Bronson grew up
in my grandmother's shtetl.

09:04.578 --> 09:08.548
Then you know Steve McQueen
was the cooler king.

09:08.599 --> 09:12.519
Louis, I need you to be
my cooler king.

09:12.586 --> 09:14.855
Yeah, I am cool.

09:14.922 --> 09:17.224
So you're authorizing me
to sign on your behalf?

09:17.275 --> 09:20.093
Yes, but under
no circumstances

09:20.144 --> 09:22.729
are you to lock in the existing
client allocations.

09:22.780 --> 09:24.114
Please, I'd die
before that happens.

09:24.148 --> 09:25.782
Let's hope it doesn't come
to that.

09:28.953 --> 09:30.453
- Is that coconut water?
- Yeah.

09:30.538 --> 09:31.938
I'm sorry.

09:31.989 --> 09:33.269
I took some with me
this morning.

09:33.274 --> 09:34.491
I hope you don't mind.

09:34.575 --> 09:35.992
Why would I mind?
You needed the hydration.

09:36.077 --> 09:38.245
You made me need
the hydration.

09:38.296 --> 09:39.412
You're welcome.

09:46.620 --> 09:48.788
- What?
- Nothing.

09:48.840 --> 09:50.340
What?

09:50.424 --> 09:52.592
Uh...

09:52.643 --> 09:54.627
I just don't like
when you drink

09:54.679 --> 09:56.513
from the bottles
in the refrigerator.

09:56.597 --> 09:58.815
- But it's my bottle.
- The ones in my fridge aren't.

09:58.900 --> 10:00.317
So you do mind
that I took it.

10:00.401 --> 10:05.272
No, I mind that you drink
from the bottles in my fridge.

10:05.323 --> 10:06.639
Okay.

10:06.691 --> 10:11.194
And that you left your
coffee mug in the sink again.

10:11.279 --> 10:12.696
I thought I was supposed
to put the mug in the sink.

10:12.780 --> 10:14.698
Yes, on the right side.
The left side is for rinsing.

10:14.782 --> 10:16.783
I can't rinse if there
are dishes piled on both sides.

10:16.834 --> 10:18.484
I'll try and remember that.

10:18.536 --> 10:21.821
You'd think a guy with your
memory wouldn't have to try.

10:21.873 --> 10:23.874
- All right, let's hear it.
- Hear what?

10:23.958 --> 10:25.508
- The list.
- What list?

10:25.593 --> 10:26.793
Of things I do
that annoy you.

10:26.844 --> 10:28.261
- I don't have a list.
- Everyone has a list.

10:28.329 --> 10:29.846
- Do you have a list?
- This isn't about my list.

10:29.931 --> 10:31.164
This is about your list.

10:31.215 --> 10:33.133
No, it's about yours
because I just told you

10:33.184 --> 10:34.500
everything that's on mine.

10:34.552 --> 10:36.853
You're telling me
that the most meticulous woman

10:36.938 --> 10:39.005
on the upper West Side
only has a list of two?

10:39.056 --> 10:40.690
- That's not fair.
- No, what's not fair

10:40.775 --> 10:42.442
is you making this
all about me.

10:42.509 --> 10:44.561
I might not be perfect,
but neither are you.

10:44.645 --> 10:46.613
So, excuse me, I have more
important things to do

10:46.680 --> 10:50.450
than talk about where
I left my coffee cup.

10:50.517 --> 10:51.985
- Fair?
- Fair.

10:52.036 --> 10:55.705
- Fair?
- Yes, fair.

10:55.790 --> 10:58.458
I didn't even like playing
nice in the sandbox.

10:58.525 --> 10:59.542
Someone has better sand toys,

10:59.627 --> 11:00.827
you take 'em.
Exactly.

11:00.878 --> 11:02.362
And you don't ask
Bolshoi ballerinas

11:02.413 --> 11:03.580
to dance the tango.

11:03.664 --> 11:05.225
That would indeed
be blasphemy.

11:05.299 --> 11:06.583
If Jessica wants compromise,

11:06.667 --> 11:09.336
she should hire a mediator,
not a gladiator.

11:09.387 --> 11:11.388
Except Jessica
doesn't want compromise.

11:11.472 --> 11:13.840
She wants a stone-cold killer to
do one thing and one thing only.

11:13.891 --> 11:15.258
And what is that?

11:15.343 --> 11:17.894
Not to lock client allocations
till Harvey lands Samsung.

11:17.979 --> 11:19.229
Then give me an order.

11:19.313 --> 11:22.232
Your order is to not let
my inner gladiator

11:22.316 --> 11:24.050
get past my outer negotiator.

11:24.101 --> 11:26.069
That's not
gonna be easy, Louis.

11:26.153 --> 11:27.873
You're like the Hulk--
once you get enraged,

11:27.888 --> 11:29.322
there's no going back.

11:29.390 --> 11:30.723
Though your description
of both my temperament

11:30.775 --> 11:32.943
and physique is accurate,
the one thing that I have

11:33.027 --> 11:35.245
on my side is that I have
no personal animus

11:35.329 --> 11:37.330
against the other side.

11:44.071 --> 11:46.039
Nesbitt.

11:46.090 --> 11:47.958
Litt.

11:48.042 --> 11:50.076
I see you're wearing
your checkered suit

11:50.127 --> 11:51.577
with your crimson power tie.

11:51.629 --> 11:53.213
You see correctly.

11:53.264 --> 11:54.747
Looks like you came
to play hardball.

11:54.799 --> 11:55.999
I didn't come
to play anything.

11:56.050 --> 11:57.750
I came to win.
Well, I'm not here to win.

11:57.802 --> 12:00.220
I'm here to make sure we
hammer out a fair agreement.

12:00.271 --> 12:01.721
And to help you achieve that,

12:01.772 --> 12:03.806
I see you've brought along
Tinker Bell.

12:04.168 --> 12:05.635
You were so scared
of Tinker Bell,

12:05.660 --> 12:07.391
you sent her to Barcelona,
for your cat trial.

12:07.416 --> 12:09.135
During which time,
she worked closely,

12:09.136 --> 12:11.120
with a different senior partner...

12:11.172 --> 12:14.341
again and again.

12:14.425 --> 12:17.227
Don't worry.

12:17.294 --> 12:19.562
Dr. Banner's
not turning green today.

12:19.630 --> 12:22.315
See, whatever you thought was
gonna happen to me here isn't.

12:22.400 --> 12:24.651
So go ahead,
wind me up all you want,

12:24.735 --> 12:26.186
'cause I ain't losing my cool.

12:26.270 --> 12:28.304
Fine.

12:28.356 --> 12:30.657
This is my initial proposal.

12:35.329 --> 12:36.997
Those are letters
I wrote to Mikado.

12:37.081 --> 12:39.165
Unopened.

12:39.250 --> 12:40.700
You never read them to her?

12:40.785 --> 12:43.152
- Not a single word.
- You son of a bitch.

12:43.204 --> 12:45.505
You think you can rattle me?
I'm un-rattleable.

12:45.589 --> 12:47.841
Really?

12:47.925 --> 12:50.627
This portrait
that you sent her.

12:53.381 --> 12:55.048
Get out!

12:55.132 --> 12:57.050
- Louis--
- I said go.

13:02.840 --> 13:05.141
Oh, yeah, you and I
are going to war.

13:05.192 --> 13:07.110
Everything's
on the goddamn table!

13:07.177 --> 13:09.779
Including the existing
client list allocations?

13:09.847 --> 13:13.116
Did you hear what I just said?
I said everything!

13:19.824 --> 13:21.691
You son of a bitch.

13:21.742 --> 13:23.293
You knew
I'd come after Samsung.

13:23.360 --> 13:25.662
I knew what suit
you'd be wearing.

13:25.713 --> 13:27.998
I know Tiger Woods
wears red on Sundays.

13:28.049 --> 13:29.332
It doesn't mean
I can beat him.

13:29.383 --> 13:32.302
I'm not going to let you poach
our clients, Harvey.

13:32.369 --> 13:34.203
You poaching our clients
is what led us

13:34.255 --> 13:36.506
to this goddamn merger
in the first place.

13:36.557 --> 13:38.808
That was fair game.
This is bad faith.

13:38.876 --> 13:41.210
Bad faith?
I'm going after Samsung.

13:41.262 --> 13:43.622
I'm not murdering anybody and
lying about it to my partners.

13:43.647 --> 13:45.148
Don't you dare put me in
with them.

13:45.215 --> 13:46.733
You put yourself in
with them.

13:46.817 --> 13:48.384
Speaking of which,
what the hell you still doing

13:48.436 --> 13:49.886
in bed with these people,
Scottie?

13:49.937 --> 13:52.439
As you know, I don't always
have the best judgment

13:52.523 --> 13:53.940
of who I get in bed with.

13:54.025 --> 13:55.608
And as for why I'm still
in business with them--

13:55.693 --> 13:56.826
Let me guess.

13:56.894 --> 13:58.945
You beat me
on the dissolution negotiation,

13:59.030 --> 14:00.163
you get your name on the door.

14:00.230 --> 14:01.331
Yep.
Darby agreed to it

14:01.398 --> 14:03.283
the second
that you pushed him out.

14:03.367 --> 14:05.168
He only did that because
he knew when word got out

14:05.235 --> 14:07.120
that his house was on fire,
he had to do something.

14:07.204 --> 14:09.372
Well, he did.
He put me against you.

14:09.423 --> 14:11.908
And as you just noted,
our house is on fire,

14:11.959 --> 14:13.960
and I'm gonna fight tooth and
nail to put the damn thing out.

14:14.045 --> 14:16.079
You can fight tooth and nail
all you like,

14:16.130 --> 14:18.381
but it's never done a thing
for you against me before.

14:18.432 --> 14:19.883
That's because I always
had something else

14:19.934 --> 14:21.468
on my mind before,

14:21.552 --> 14:24.387
but you've made it clear that
that's never going to happen.

14:24.438 --> 14:25.755
So, if you think
you're gonna win this time,

14:25.806 --> 14:27.524
you've got
another thing coming.

14:27.591 --> 14:28.942
Say what you want, Scottie.

14:29.026 --> 14:30.560
I'm going in there,
and you're not gonna stop me.

14:33.814 --> 14:35.148
I'm afraid I already did.

14:35.232 --> 14:36.783
Client list just got locked.

14:36.867 --> 14:38.768
So you can go in there
and give it a shot,

14:38.819 --> 14:39.986
but they're never gonna sign
with a guy

14:40.071 --> 14:42.789
who just got played
on their front porch.

14:53.325 --> 14:55.308
- Hey.
- Hey.

14:56.109 --> 14:57.837
I got your message.

14:57.857 --> 14:59.191
Thanks for meeting me.

14:59.275 --> 15:01.610
It's not often I get invited
out to hear an apology.

15:01.661 --> 15:05.146
I'm so sorry
I snapped at you.

15:05.198 --> 15:09.317
I got defensive, and when I went
away to think about it,

15:09.369 --> 15:10.536
I came up with why.

15:10.620 --> 15:11.753
Why?

15:11.821 --> 15:15.156
I feel like a guest
in your apartment.

15:15.208 --> 15:17.509
And I think it's because
we spend all of our time

15:17.594 --> 15:19.795
at your place and none
of the time at mine.

15:19.846 --> 15:21.296
Yeah, but I told you,
when I'm at your place,

15:21.347 --> 15:23.832
all I can picture is Tess
in a bedsheet.

15:23.883 --> 15:27.002
I know.
And that's why we're here.

15:27.053 --> 15:29.137
Come on, I want
to show you something.

15:33.009 --> 15:35.027
Louis, we gave you one job,
and you blew it.

15:35.111 --> 15:37.229
How the hell did you screw up
those negotiations?

15:37.313 --> 15:38.513
Screw up? Come on.
What are you talking about?

15:38.565 --> 15:39.531
I got us the corporate jet.

15:39.616 --> 15:41.016
We keep
our first dividend checks,

15:41.067 --> 15:42.234
and they pay
for our new letterhead.

15:42.318 --> 15:43.535
So you know what?

15:43.620 --> 15:45.120
You just put that in your pipe,
and you smoke it.

15:45.187 --> 15:47.539
I don't give a shit
about the goddamn letterhead!

15:47.624 --> 15:48.991
You don't think
I know that?

15:49.042 --> 15:51.743
Nobody cares about
the goddamn letterhead, okay?

15:51.828 --> 15:53.295
Nigel went after Mikado.

15:53.362 --> 15:54.913
What the hell is Mikado?

15:54.998 --> 15:56.415
Not "what," "who."
She's a cat.

15:56.499 --> 15:58.050
He went after your cat?

15:58.134 --> 15:59.468
He went after his cat.

15:59.535 --> 16:03.171
He tortured his cat?

16:03.223 --> 16:06.642
He deprived her
of my letters.

16:08.511 --> 16:12.147
Louis, you lost your shit
during a negotiation

16:12.214 --> 16:14.549
because someone didn't read
your letters to their cat?

16:14.601 --> 16:18.320
Harvey, please.
I'm sorry I lost my head.

16:18.387 --> 16:20.722
I don't even remember
signing the agreement.

16:20.773 --> 16:22.991
Well, you did!

16:23.059 --> 16:24.610
And, Louis,
you've been asking Jessica

16:24.694 --> 16:26.227
to give you the ball
instead of me

16:26.279 --> 16:27.246
ever since the day I met you.

16:27.330 --> 16:28.730
Well, she gave it to you,

16:28.781 --> 16:32.334
and you just went and scored
a touchdown for the other team.

16:43.263 --> 16:46.915
Oh, my God.

16:46.966 --> 16:49.017
Your grandmother's apartment.

16:49.085 --> 16:51.470
I still own it.

16:51.554 --> 16:55.524
You kept it
this entire time?

16:55.591 --> 16:57.809
I couldn't rent it.

16:57.894 --> 16:58.977
I couldn't sell it.

16:59.062 --> 17:01.113
I...

17:01.197 --> 17:02.564
Couldn't even come here.

17:02.615 --> 17:04.616
That means the last time
you were here...

17:04.701 --> 17:06.952
We were here.

17:07.036 --> 17:08.619
So you want to move in here?

17:08.704 --> 17:10.622
I want us to move in here.

17:13.576 --> 17:15.410
- Mike--
- Rachel.

17:15.461 --> 17:17.913
I've only ever been here twice,

17:17.964 --> 17:21.116
and both times were with you.

17:21.166 --> 17:23.585
The first time we stood here,

17:23.636 --> 17:26.954
and we pictured
living together.

17:27.006 --> 17:29.508
I'll never forget that.

17:29.592 --> 17:32.978
- Neither will I.
- And the second time...

17:33.062 --> 17:36.148
Was one of the hardest days
of my life,

17:36.232 --> 17:40.018
but I got through it
because we were together.

17:45.408 --> 17:48.994
That's one the sweetest things
I've ever heard.

17:53.249 --> 17:56.618
You don't have to answer
right now, okay?

17:56.669 --> 18:00.422
I just wanted to show you
what we could have.

18:07.764 --> 18:10.048
Goddamn Louis.

18:10.133 --> 18:11.666
Let it go.

18:11.718 --> 18:13.051
Let it go?

18:13.136 --> 18:14.603
You don't say "let it go"

18:14.670 --> 18:16.855
unless you already
didn't let it go.

18:16.939 --> 18:19.474
You gonna take it out on me
for taking it out on him?

18:19.525 --> 18:21.276
At the moment,
we don't have the time.

18:21.343 --> 18:22.811
Good, because
I've already got Mike

18:22.862 --> 18:24.696
looking for ways
to revise the agreement.

18:24.781 --> 18:26.114
The problem
isn't revising it.

18:26.182 --> 18:28.066
The problem is
Louis already signed it.

18:28.151 --> 18:29.785
You're saying
we need to find a loophole.

18:29.852 --> 18:31.036
I am.

18:31.120 --> 18:32.654
Well, if we can't steal
from their clients

18:32.705 --> 18:34.623
and the revenues from new ones
don't count,

18:34.690 --> 18:36.158
what the hell
are we supposed to do?

18:36.209 --> 18:37.793
There's only one thing
to do--

18:37.860 --> 18:39.300
look at the money
we're already owed.

18:39.328 --> 18:41.880
- I don't follow you.
- We're on a cash basis.

18:41.964 --> 18:44.532
We can't count the revenues
we haven't collected yet.

18:44.584 --> 18:47.368
But if we can entice someone
to pay us sooner,

18:47.420 --> 18:49.388
we can get that revenue in
under the window.

18:49.472 --> 18:51.039
Bad faith--
I like it.

18:51.090 --> 18:52.931
The question is,
who still owes us enough money

18:53.009 --> 18:54.375
to make a difference?

18:54.427 --> 18:55.543
Folsom Foods.

18:55.595 --> 18:56.878
The second they pay
their settlement,

18:56.929 --> 18:58.096
we get paid our fee.

18:58.181 --> 18:59.564
You came to that
all on your own.

18:59.649 --> 19:02.350
Yeah, about an hour ago.
Don't tell me I beat you to it.

19:02.402 --> 19:04.402
Maybe. But you didn't have
Harvey slowing you down.

19:04.404 --> 19:06.271
- That's a fair point.
- Okay, I'm right here.

19:06.355 --> 19:08.056
Well, your idea is no good,

19:08.107 --> 19:09.574
because it'll be
a cold day in hell

19:09.659 --> 19:12.110
before Daniel Hardman lifts
a finger to help this firm,

19:12.195 --> 19:14.279
and I'd rather lose
this negotiation

19:14.363 --> 19:16.083
than to cut a deal
with that son of a bitch.

19:16.165 --> 19:18.233
You don't have to.
Hardman was running point.

19:18.284 --> 19:20.902
Folsom's not his client.
They're Robert Zane's.

19:20.953 --> 19:23.538
- He's no fan of us either.
- Maybe not.

19:23.589 --> 19:27.125
But we can handle
Robert Zane.

19:29.262 --> 19:31.246
You caught on
to my plan there.

19:31.297 --> 19:33.248
You mean the most obvious
plan in the world?

19:33.299 --> 19:35.379
I mean the plan that
I thought of and that you didn't

19:35.384 --> 19:37.252
and that I'm the perfect
person to implement.

19:37.303 --> 19:39.354
You really think
you can handle Robert Zane?

19:39.421 --> 19:40.722
I have a relationship
with him.

19:40.773 --> 19:42.090
Yeah. You're sleeping
with his daughter.

19:42.141 --> 19:43.608
I'm sure
he's your biggest fan.

19:43.693 --> 19:46.778
Okay, it's not like that.
I had dinner at the man's house.

19:46.863 --> 19:48.146
I had dinner
at the White House.

19:48.231 --> 19:49.764
They're not gonna make me
Attorney General.

19:49.816 --> 19:51.432
Okay, first of all,
bullshit.

19:51.484 --> 19:53.085
Second of all,
do you have a better idea?

19:53.119 --> 19:54.435
No, I don't.

19:54.487 --> 19:56.371
But are you ready to use
your relationship with Rachel

19:56.438 --> 19:57.789
to get her father to turn?

19:57.874 --> 19:59.791
Doesn't matter,
because I'm not gonna do that.

19:59.876 --> 20:01.910
I'm just gonna use it
to get him to hear me out

20:01.961 --> 20:04.663
in the first place.
Good luck with that.

20:04.747 --> 20:08.667
Hey, how'd you know that
White House thing was bullshit?

20:16.342 --> 20:19.127
Mike. I was wondering when
I was gonna get you out here.

20:19.178 --> 20:20.461
Ah, golf isn't really
my thing.

20:20.513 --> 20:22.597
What is your thing?

20:22.648 --> 20:24.799
- Sports.
- You're telling me

20:24.851 --> 20:26.818
you're one of those guys
that doesn't think

20:26.903 --> 20:28.353
golf is a sport?
Of course not.

20:28.437 --> 20:31.323
I can tell you're an athlete
just by looking at you, sir.

20:31.407 --> 20:33.692
With an attitude like that,
you must be here on business.

20:33.776 --> 20:35.160
- Folsom Foods.
- Ah...

20:35.244 --> 20:37.312
You're gonna stick that loss
in my face?

20:37.363 --> 20:39.531
No, I'm here to make
that loss sting a little less.

20:39.615 --> 20:41.983
You move up your payment
by one fiscal quarter,

20:42.034 --> 20:44.503
we'll take a 10% haircut
on our fee.

20:44.587 --> 20:46.922
- 10% is a little light.
- All right.

20:46.989 --> 20:49.341
I'll cut right to it.
I can go as high as 20%.

20:49.425 --> 20:50.491
Are you saying 20%?

20:50.543 --> 20:52.327
Yes.

20:52.378 --> 20:54.829
Then I'm saying no.

20:54.881 --> 20:57.516
Sir, this...
This is a win for you.

20:57.600 --> 20:59.768
No, this isn't shit
for me.

20:59.835 --> 21:02.437
This is about Harvey Specter
and Jessica Pearson

21:02.504 --> 21:04.005
and their divorce negotiations.

21:04.056 --> 21:06.341
And you don't go
to the one you didn't marry

21:06.392 --> 21:08.059
to stick it
to the one you did.

21:08.144 --> 21:10.178
We could go
straight to your client.

21:10.229 --> 21:11.846
By the time
they accepted the offer,

21:11.898 --> 21:13.398
it'd be too late.

21:13.482 --> 21:15.350
You just gave that away
when you went straight to 20%.

21:15.401 --> 21:17.702
I went straight to 20%
out of respect.

21:17.787 --> 21:20.739
Now you're repaying me
by being a--

21:20.823 --> 21:22.023
What?

21:22.074 --> 21:23.825
You don't have the balls
to say it.

21:23.876 --> 21:25.243
I will.

21:25.328 --> 21:27.528
A dick.
I'm being a dick.

21:27.580 --> 21:30.698
The question is,
what are you gonna do about it?

21:32.218 --> 21:35.003
I'm not gonna do
anything about it.

21:35.054 --> 21:36.888
I just wonder
what your daughter's gonna think

21:36.973 --> 21:38.807
when she finds out
you screwed over your own client

21:38.874 --> 21:40.592
just to stick it
to the man she loves.

21:40.676 --> 21:42.543
She loves Harvey Specter.

21:42.595 --> 21:44.479
No.

21:44.546 --> 21:48.149
But when you go after Harvey,
you go after me.

22:00.978 --> 22:02.650
The Whooping Crane
of Manchuria.

22:03.115 --> 22:05.366
- It's my calming animal.
- You've chosen well.

22:07.669 --> 22:09.587
What can I do for you,
Katrina?

22:09.671 --> 22:11.739
- I never heard back from you.
- About what?

22:11.790 --> 22:13.240
About anything...

22:13.292 --> 22:15.960
Especially what we're going
to do about negotiations.

22:16.044 --> 22:17.762
There's no more negotiation.

22:17.846 --> 22:19.597
I had one assignment,
and I blew it.

22:19.681 --> 22:23.083
Louis, the opera isn't over
until the fat lady sings.

22:23.135 --> 22:25.553
No, this is not the opera.

22:25.604 --> 22:27.305
It's football.

22:27.389 --> 22:28.639
Harvey said it.

22:28.724 --> 22:30.224
They gave me the ball.

22:30.275 --> 22:31.893
I scored a touchdown
for the other team,

22:31.944 --> 22:33.110
it's the eighth inning,

22:33.195 --> 22:35.229
and there's no more time
left on the clock.

22:35.280 --> 22:36.898
I never thought
I'd hear you say that.

22:36.949 --> 22:38.432
It's the fact.
There's nothing we can do.

22:38.484 --> 22:39.617
I signed the agreement,

22:39.701 --> 22:41.202
and Nigel's
never gonna reopen it.

22:41.269 --> 22:44.939
Well, then I guess it's
a good thing I found a loophole.

22:44.990 --> 22:46.491
What are you talking about?

22:46.575 --> 22:48.125
We can't steal
their clients,

22:48.210 --> 22:50.328
but we can still increase
our revenue.

22:50.412 --> 22:51.946
No. New clients
don't count.

22:51.997 --> 22:53.464
I'm not talking
about new clients.

22:53.549 --> 22:56.450
I'm talking about new revenue
from clients we already have.

22:56.502 --> 22:58.753
Well, that's operating
in complete bad faith.

23:01.289 --> 23:02.850
Now, what clients
are you talking about.

23:02.891 --> 23:04.592
First, I got you something.

23:04.643 --> 23:06.794
Okay, Katrina,
you know what?

23:06.845 --> 23:09.514
I really don't have time
for sentimental--

23:13.018 --> 23:14.986
The trademark came through
ten minutes ago.

23:15.070 --> 23:17.355
I...
Don't know what to say.

23:17.439 --> 23:18.940
Say you forgive me

23:18.991 --> 23:20.741
for letting you
lose control of Nigel.

23:23.412 --> 23:24.662
I do.

23:26.915 --> 23:29.834
Now, let's go get
some goddamn new revenue.

23:38.927 --> 23:40.461
You.

23:40.512 --> 23:41.796
How'd you get in here?

23:41.847 --> 23:43.664
'Cause I know
how to get things done.

23:43.715 --> 23:44.999
You didn't
the last time we met.

23:45.050 --> 23:46.500
Last time you saw me
coming a mile away.

23:46.552 --> 23:48.219
This time,
I'm blindsiding you.

23:50.105 --> 23:53.007
- I didn't know we were at war.
- We're not.

23:53.058 --> 23:54.525
It's just a training exercise.

23:56.177 --> 23:57.862
These are my personal
bank statements.

23:57.946 --> 23:59.864
You stole my money.

23:59.948 --> 24:01.482
No, not stole...

24:01.533 --> 24:02.683
Relocated.

24:02.734 --> 24:04.702
- I could have you arrested.
- You could.

24:04.786 --> 24:07.572
But then you'd be missing out
on all this...

24:09.541 --> 24:12.159
Tax shelter in the Caymans,

24:12.210 --> 24:14.530
carried interest classification
for your personal holdings,

24:14.580 --> 24:17.248
blind irrevocable trust for up
to six of your unborn children.

24:17.332 --> 24:19.083
- And this means...
- You'll never pay

24:19.167 --> 24:20.751
a nickel in taxes
your entire life,

24:20.836 --> 24:22.556
not to mention your money
will be too secure

24:22.588 --> 24:25.923
for someone to do
what I just did.

24:26.008 --> 24:27.708
How'd you do all this?

24:27.759 --> 24:29.393
Well, you said you'd call us
for the paperwork.

24:29.478 --> 24:31.429
This is how I do paperwork.
Oh, and one last thing--

24:31.513 --> 24:33.230
that Ferrari
that your ex-wife took?

24:33.315 --> 24:35.433
Yeah?

24:35.517 --> 24:37.268
I got it back.

24:40.155 --> 24:41.772
You're hired.

24:44.693 --> 24:46.611
Don't you need to get
board approval?

24:46.695 --> 24:48.746
To be my personal attorney?

24:48.830 --> 24:50.397
No, for
Gianopolous Limited Holdings

24:50.449 --> 24:53.067
to expand their relationship
with us.

24:53.118 --> 24:54.752
- Are you crazy?
- How is that crazy?

24:54.836 --> 24:56.504
I just showed you
what I'm capable of.

24:56.571 --> 24:58.789
You showed me you could beat
a tribe of Visigoths.

24:58.874 --> 25:01.175
You want me to give you control
of the Roman Empire?

25:01.242 --> 25:03.511
I can handle
the Roman Empire.

25:03.578 --> 25:04.962
Even if you could,

25:05.047 --> 25:07.632
from Mr. Gianopolous's
perspective,

25:07.716 --> 25:09.967
you're a nobody.

25:11.637 --> 25:15.422
Please, can you at least find
a way to convince him?

25:15.474 --> 25:17.257
I'm sorry.

25:17.309 --> 25:18.693
If I bring your name
up to him,

25:18.760 --> 25:20.394
he will laugh me
out of the room.

25:30.038 --> 25:31.872
That's a check
from Folsom Foods.

25:31.940 --> 25:34.041
It's the remainder
of what they owe us.

25:34.109 --> 25:36.877
Holy shit.
That's all of it.

25:36.945 --> 25:39.547
It's hard to believe that
you could get Zane to do this

25:39.614 --> 25:41.134
without using
his daughter against him.

25:41.216 --> 25:42.783
Maybe I'm
an excellent negotiator.

25:42.834 --> 25:44.385
If you're
an excellent negotiator,

25:44.452 --> 25:46.453
this wouldn't include
a 20% haircut.

25:46.505 --> 25:48.506
It would be 10%,
like I would have gotten.

25:48.590 --> 25:50.391
You? He wouldn't have
even talked to you.

25:50.458 --> 25:53.127
Like you're not talking
to me right now?

25:53.178 --> 25:55.062
What'd you say to Zane?

25:55.130 --> 25:58.632
Let's just say we may have
gotten what we wanted, but...

25:58.684 --> 26:01.102
My girlfriend's dad's gonna be
pissed at me for a little while.

26:01.153 --> 26:03.521
Then you're a better
negotiator than I thought.

26:22.674 --> 26:24.375
I never should have
given you my key.

26:24.459 --> 26:26.177
And I never
should have forgotten

26:26.261 --> 26:28.495
that you'll stop at nothing
to beat me.

26:28.547 --> 26:29.997
No, you shouldn't have.

26:30.048 --> 26:31.348
Harvey...

26:31.433 --> 26:33.267
The man that I knew
may have fought to the death,

26:33.334 --> 26:35.636
but he always operated
in good faith.

26:35.687 --> 26:38.189
I told you, I am not bound
by good faith on this deal

26:38.273 --> 26:39.724
after what your boss did.

26:39.808 --> 26:41.892
It's not just Edward's firm.

26:41.977 --> 26:43.110
What does that
have to do with it?

26:43.178 --> 26:44.499
What does that
have to do with it?

26:44.529 --> 26:46.363
You shrunk the whole pie
for the sole purpose

26:46.448 --> 26:48.115
of getting a bigger piece
for yourself,

26:48.183 --> 26:49.623
and it screwed me,
along with Edward.

26:49.651 --> 26:51.786
What do you want, Scottie?

26:51.853 --> 26:53.788
I want you to exclude
the Folsom Foods payments

26:53.855 --> 26:55.906
from the settlement
calculations.

26:55.991 --> 26:59.076
And why would I do that?

26:59.161 --> 27:00.661
Because I need you to.

27:00.712 --> 27:03.464
I'm afraid that's not enough.

27:05.867 --> 27:07.918
You, uh--
you came to me.

27:08.003 --> 27:09.420
You needed help
with Ava Hessington

27:09.504 --> 27:11.589
after you sent me back
to London.

27:11.673 --> 27:13.153
You said that I mean
something to you,

27:13.208 --> 27:16.260
that I'll--I'll always
mean something to you.

27:16.344 --> 27:18.395
Was that bullshit or not?
It wasn't bullshit,

27:18.480 --> 27:20.181
and if you're in trouble
personally--

27:20.232 --> 27:22.683
I am in trouble personally.
You said so yourself.

27:22.734 --> 27:26.220
Our house is on fire,
and it's my job to put it out.

27:26.271 --> 27:27.905
If you crush me...

27:27.989 --> 27:29.690
I'll have nothing.

27:29.741 --> 27:31.659
That's not personal.
That's business.

27:31.726 --> 27:33.410
Okay,
let's talk business.

27:33.495 --> 27:36.580
You made a career out
of putting I.O.U.s in the bank.

27:36.665 --> 27:38.415
Do the same thing right now.

27:38.500 --> 27:41.168
Put an I.O.U. in with me.

27:41.236 --> 27:42.402
And what's to stop you

27:42.454 --> 27:45.923
from still trying
to screw me after that?

27:46.007 --> 27:47.875
My word that I won't.

27:55.849 --> 27:57.301
He asked you
to move in together?

27:57.302 --> 27:58.919
- I know. It's...
- Quick?

28:01.197 --> 28:04.864
I was going to say
that it's a-a big step,

28:04.865 --> 28:06.166
because it's not
really that quick.

28:06.217 --> 28:07.717
We've known each other
for a while.

28:07.801 --> 28:10.170
Yes, but you only
just started dating.

28:10.221 --> 28:12.088
So I guess that means
you're against it.

28:12.173 --> 28:14.390
Rachel,
I'm not against it.

28:14.475 --> 28:15.808
You told me that you love him,

28:15.876 --> 28:17.594
and I couldn't be happier
for you.

28:17.678 --> 28:20.680
But you got a lot
going on right now.

28:20.731 --> 28:22.932
You don't even know where
you're gonna go to law school.

28:22.933 --> 28:24.383
I'm just saying

28:24.435 --> 28:27.020
maybe you don't want to rush
into this so quickly.

28:27.071 --> 28:29.355
Rush into what?

28:34.528 --> 28:37.447
Well, Mike asked me
to move in with him.

28:37.531 --> 28:39.449
Move in with him?

28:39.533 --> 28:41.951
Shit, what's he gonna
do to me then?

28:42.036 --> 28:44.704
- What are you talking about?
- You didn't hear?

28:44.755 --> 28:46.256
He came to me
on the golf course.

28:46.340 --> 28:47.790
To ask for permission?

28:47.875 --> 28:51.261
No, he didn't ask for shit.

28:51.345 --> 28:53.746
I got to hand it to him.
The boy's got some balls.

28:53.797 --> 28:55.632
- What?
- He kicked my ass.

28:55.716 --> 28:57.550
Didn't even have the courtesy
to give me a--

28:57.601 --> 28:58.885
- Robert!
- Oh, come on.

28:58.936 --> 29:01.387
She's gonna be a lawyer.
Gonna hear a lot worse.

29:01.438 --> 29:03.439
Dad, what are you talking
about--what happened?

29:03.524 --> 29:06.226
He wanted an advance
on the Folsom settlement.

29:06.277 --> 29:08.361
And he put the screws to me
to get it.

29:08.428 --> 29:10.863
He put the screws
to you how?

29:16.654 --> 29:18.738
Rachel.
This is a surprise.

29:18.789 --> 29:21.241
What happened to--
Tess in a bedsheet?

29:21.292 --> 29:25.111
It was replaced by the image
of you manipulating my dad.

29:25.162 --> 29:26.946
Okay, I did not manipulate
your dad.

29:26.997 --> 29:28.665
How exactly
would you describe it?

29:28.749 --> 29:31.134
I didn't go there
to manipulate him, all right?

29:31.218 --> 29:32.579
He--he was about to make
a decision

29:32.586 --> 29:34.420
that was going to affect him,
us, and his client,

29:34.471 --> 29:35.672
and I just pointed that out
to him.

29:35.756 --> 29:37.223
And then when
that didn't work,

29:37.291 --> 29:38.624
you pointed out
that I wouldn't approve.

29:38.676 --> 29:39.642
He was bullying me.

29:39.727 --> 29:42.729
So you used me
to bully him back.

29:42.796 --> 29:45.348
I was talking to my mom
about moving in with you

29:45.432 --> 29:48.101
when I found out about this.
Okay, Rachel...

29:48.152 --> 29:50.603
I'm sorry, all right?

29:50.654 --> 29:52.488
Let me call him right now.
I'll apologize to him--

29:52.573 --> 29:53.740
Him?

29:53.807 --> 29:55.692
He loved it!
He did?

29:55.776 --> 29:57.610
Yeah, he thought
you had balls.

29:57.661 --> 29:59.779
- So then what's the problem?
- Are you not listening to me?

29:59.830 --> 30:01.647
I was thinking
about moving in with you,

30:01.699 --> 30:03.866
and then I find out
that you go to my dad--

30:03.951 --> 30:05.335
Wait, wait, wait.
Are--

30:05.419 --> 30:07.670
are you saying
this changes everything?

30:07.755 --> 30:10.039
- It's complicated.
- What's complicated about it?

30:10.124 --> 30:11.657
Forget--I don't even want
to get into this

30:11.709 --> 30:13.209
with you right now!
Rachel, if you don't want

30:13.294 --> 30:14.660
to live with me,
why don't you just tell me

30:14.712 --> 30:17.880
you don't want to live with me?
I didn't say that.

30:17.965 --> 30:19.799
Well, do you?

30:24.888 --> 30:28.057
You said I could have
some time, so...

30:30.477 --> 30:32.895
I just need some time.

30:49.213 --> 30:51.914
You excluded
the Folsom Foods payment

30:51.999 --> 30:53.699
from the revenue totals
on this.

30:53.751 --> 30:55.835
It's a draft document.
I haven't showed it to anyone.

30:55.886 --> 30:57.203
I just wanted
to run it by you.

30:57.254 --> 30:59.172
Well, what reason
could you possibly have

30:59.223 --> 31:00.923
for wanting to do it at all?

31:01.008 --> 31:02.592
Because Scottie
came to me and asked,

31:02.676 --> 31:04.227
and I think
it's good business.

31:04.311 --> 31:05.551
Well, your idea
of good business

31:05.562 --> 31:06.879
is different from mine,

31:06.930 --> 31:09.515
because we already took
less money from Folsom Foods,

31:09.566 --> 31:11.651
and now you want us to take
less money from Darby.

31:11.718 --> 31:14.220
Jessica,
if we screw him over,

31:14.271 --> 31:15.905
he's gonna come back at us.

31:15.989 --> 31:17.223
It might not be tomorrow.

31:17.274 --> 31:18.775
It might not be six months
from now,

31:18.859 --> 31:20.526
but he's gonna find a way.

31:20.577 --> 31:22.779
- You mean she'll find a way.
- That's exactly what I mean.

31:22.863 --> 31:24.414
And maybe she will.

31:24.498 --> 31:26.732
But I've never known you
to run from a fight before.

31:26.784 --> 31:28.734
My name was never
on the door before.

31:28.786 --> 31:30.870
You said it yourself.

31:30.921 --> 31:34.207
I have to think differently
now that I'm in this position.

31:34.258 --> 31:35.908
I did say that.

31:35.959 --> 31:37.427
And it's not just gonna
be one fight.

31:37.511 --> 31:40.179
It's gonna be the Hatfields
and the McCoys all over again.

31:40.247 --> 31:43.416
Are you sure this isn't really
about your history with her?

31:43.467 --> 31:46.636
- What if it is?
- She could just be playing us.

31:46.720 --> 31:50.089
She could, but...
I trust her.

31:51.558 --> 31:53.592
Jessica,
it's time to turn the page.

31:56.447 --> 31:58.481
Well, I don't want
to turn the page.

31:58.565 --> 32:01.067
I want to close the book.

32:01.118 --> 32:04.770
Tell her we'll exclude
the payment and honor our deal.

32:10.327 --> 32:13.296
Louis, I know it didn't go
exactly as planned,

32:13.380 --> 32:16.332
but you need to pick yourself up
and dust yourself off.

32:16.417 --> 32:18.117
Exactly as planned?

32:18.168 --> 32:20.336
I utterly failed.

32:20.421 --> 32:22.288
I don't even deserve
this stupid mug.

32:22.339 --> 32:24.090
"Litt Up"?
It should say "shit up."

32:24.141 --> 32:25.641
You didn't fail.
You impressed him.

32:25.726 --> 32:28.845
Yeah, that and $45 will get
my cat a Brazilian bikini wax.

32:28.929 --> 32:30.179
You got a new cat?

32:30.264 --> 32:31.797
Fostering.

32:31.849 --> 32:33.900
Louis...enough.

32:33.967 --> 32:36.436
You need to go to Harvey.

32:36.487 --> 32:38.988
You mean tell him that I'm
even more of an embarrassment

32:39.072 --> 32:40.639
than he says I am?

32:40.691 --> 32:42.442
You're not an embarrassment.

32:42.493 --> 32:44.444
You may need Harvey
to put the ball in the end zone,

32:44.495 --> 32:46.028
but you had the idea,
you set it up,

32:46.113 --> 32:48.481
and you drove the ball
down to the one-yard line.

32:48.532 --> 32:50.366
No, I didn't have the idea.

32:50.451 --> 32:51.868
You had the idea!

32:51.952 --> 32:53.920
And you executed it.

32:53.987 --> 32:55.538
But you're giving me credit.

32:55.622 --> 32:57.823
If Harvey executes this,
he'll give you credit.

32:57.875 --> 32:59.509
No, he won't.
He never does.

32:59.593 --> 33:01.210
Louis, he might.

33:01.295 --> 33:03.513
You want him to see
a different side of you,

33:03.597 --> 33:05.664
give him a chance to show
a different side of him.

33:05.716 --> 33:07.550
You know what?
It doesn't matter anyway.

33:07.634 --> 33:09.469
Harvey doesn't need
my help anymore.

33:09.520 --> 33:11.337
It's too late.
No, it isn't.

33:11.388 --> 33:13.139
Haven't you heard?

33:13.190 --> 33:15.391
Heard what?

33:31.525 --> 33:33.376
Harvey,
I have some bad news.

33:33.460 --> 33:35.578
- What is it?
- I think you should sit down.

33:35.662 --> 33:38.047
Donna, unless someone died,
I don't need to sit down.

33:38.131 --> 33:41.384
Just tell me.
Hessington Oil just fired us.

33:48.475 --> 33:50.710
- Scottie betrayed me.
- You don't know that.

33:50.777 --> 33:52.845
One plus one equals two,
Donna.

33:52.896 --> 33:54.564
And I know
how to goddamn add.

33:54.648 --> 33:55.898
I didn't count
the Folsom money,

33:55.983 --> 33:58.067
and suddenly
our oil revenues are gone

33:58.151 --> 34:00.236
and her piece of the pie
just skyrocketed.

34:00.320 --> 34:02.221
Harvey, please,
don't do anything rash.

34:02.272 --> 34:04.223
What the hell
are you saying?

34:04.274 --> 34:06.442
- I'm saying call her.
- How would that go?

34:06.527 --> 34:08.244
"Hey, Scottie,
thanks for dicking me over.

34:08.328 --> 34:09.579
Could you please
take it back?"

34:09.663 --> 34:11.197
You don't know
how it would go.

34:11.248 --> 34:13.416
And you could find out
if you would drop your pride

34:13.500 --> 34:15.179
and just give her
the benefit of the doubt.

34:15.202 --> 34:17.235
You gave someone
the benefit of the doubt,

34:17.286 --> 34:18.838
and look how that turned out.

34:20.841 --> 34:23.042
You think just because
you bought me a handbag,

34:23.092 --> 34:26.012
you can say that to me?

34:26.079 --> 34:27.713
Okay, I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have said that.

34:27.764 --> 34:29.297
But I just got played,

34:29.382 --> 34:32.134
and I'm not about to call
Scottie and cry about it.

34:32.219 --> 34:34.219
- So what are you gonna do?
- I'm gonna figure out

34:34.271 --> 34:36.806
how to do to her
what she just did to me.

34:44.938 --> 34:46.059
- Harvey.
- Not now, Louis.

34:46.139 --> 34:47.591
Yes, now, Harvey.
I've got the answer.

34:47.592 --> 34:48.913
- The answer to what?
- To shoving

34:48.960 --> 34:50.928
the Hessington Oil firing
up Edward Darby's ass.

34:51.514 --> 34:52.882
Harvey.

34:52.933 --> 34:54.583
Harvey!

34:56.085 --> 34:57.854
Tony Gianopolous.

34:57.921 --> 35:00.523
He can triple the revenue
we lost with Hessington Oil.

35:00.590 --> 35:02.925
And they're technically
not a new client.

35:02.977 --> 35:04.944
So there's nothing
Scottie can do.

35:05.029 --> 35:06.446
Well, what makes you think
he's gonna go for it?

35:06.530 --> 35:08.931
Because I went there,
and they are primed to say yes.

35:08.983 --> 35:11.784
They just won't...

35:11.869 --> 35:14.737
They just won't
say yes to me.

35:14.788 --> 35:18.157
Give him this.
They'll say yes to you.

35:23.664 --> 35:25.581
Louis, this is brilliant.

35:25.633 --> 35:28.251
And if you hadn't had the balls
to come to me,

35:28.302 --> 35:29.752
we'd have nothing
right now.

35:29.803 --> 35:31.220
Harvey, no.

35:31.288 --> 35:32.672
I should have come
to you sooner,

35:32.756 --> 35:34.623
but I didn't because I just--
Louis.

35:34.675 --> 35:36.426
I've told you this before,

35:36.477 --> 35:39.128
but it's always been when
I needed something from you.

35:39.179 --> 35:41.964
And I don't need anything
from you right now,

35:42.016 --> 35:43.466
because you just gave it to me.

35:43.517 --> 35:46.936
So maybe you can hear it
when I say it--

35:46.987 --> 35:50.273
I respect you.

35:50.324 --> 35:52.141
You're an excellent attorney,

35:52.192 --> 35:55.028
a valuable member
of this firm.

35:57.247 --> 35:58.498
And a friend?

35:58.582 --> 36:00.316
Don't push it.

36:02.036 --> 36:03.486
Sorry.

36:03.537 --> 36:07.373
Seriously, Harvey,
I just have to say, um...

36:09.376 --> 36:11.461
It means so much
when you say all that.

36:11.512 --> 36:12.879
Do you need a tissue
or something?

36:12.963 --> 36:15.014
- Can I use your pocket square?
- Under no circumstances.

36:15.099 --> 36:17.433
I'll be fine.
And you and Jessica

36:17.501 --> 36:19.852
need to take that over
to Gianopolous right now.

36:19.937 --> 36:22.838
Screw that.
I'm going over there with you.

36:29.813 --> 36:31.230
He's not there.

36:31.315 --> 36:32.482
What?
Where is he?

36:32.533 --> 36:34.683
He went to see
Tony Gianopolous.

36:34.735 --> 36:36.736
- By himself?
- No, with Louis.

36:36.820 --> 36:38.988
With Louis?
What, is he mad at me?

36:39.039 --> 36:41.040
Rachel's the only one
who's mad at you.

36:42.692 --> 36:43.910
- She told you.
- She didn't have to.

36:43.994 --> 36:45.411
What were you thinking,

36:45.496 --> 36:46.879
pulling all that shit
with her dad?

36:46.964 --> 36:48.548
I didn't think
it would come to that.

36:48.632 --> 36:50.083
He didn't mind.
Why should she?

36:51.418 --> 36:53.586
Anyone who understands women
in any way

36:53.670 --> 36:55.888
would know that was
a bad idea from the start.

36:55.973 --> 36:58.057
- Harvey liked it.
- Proving my point.

37:01.428 --> 37:03.062
I asked her
to move in with me.

37:03.147 --> 37:04.380
I know.

37:04.431 --> 37:05.548
She told you?

37:05.599 --> 37:07.049
Of course she did.

37:07.101 --> 37:09.218
I can't intuit everything.
What am I, the Dalai Lama?

37:09.269 --> 37:11.437
Donna, you should have seen
her face when I asked her.

37:11.522 --> 37:13.523
She was so happy.

37:13.574 --> 37:15.224
I'm sure she was.
It was very romantic.

37:15.275 --> 37:17.443
How could she be so happy
and then just not want to do it?

37:17.528 --> 37:19.895
Who says
she doesn't want to do it?

37:19.947 --> 37:21.730
I told her to take her time,

37:21.782 --> 37:23.732
but I-I didn't think
she'd need it.

37:23.784 --> 37:25.585
Why wouldn't she need it?

37:25.669 --> 37:27.670
Just because you made
some romantic gesture

37:27.737 --> 37:29.922
doesn't mean that all reason
goes out the window.

37:30.007 --> 37:31.674
I've had a pit in my stomach
since last night.

37:31.741 --> 37:33.176
I...

37:33.243 --> 37:35.211
I need to do something.

37:35.262 --> 37:37.746
You need to look
in the mirror.

37:37.798 --> 37:39.215
What?

37:40.517 --> 37:42.237
I just jumped into
a relationship with a man

37:42.269 --> 37:43.603
who, it turns out,

37:43.687 --> 37:45.438
was pretending to be
something he wasn't.

37:45.522 --> 37:46.939
Rachel already knows

37:47.024 --> 37:49.609
that you're pretending to be
something you're not.

37:49.693 --> 37:51.444
All you need to do
is just give her time

37:51.528 --> 37:52.928
to figure it all out.

37:54.565 --> 37:56.866
What if she says no?

37:56.933 --> 37:58.818
Then she says no.

37:58.902 --> 38:02.538
But pushing her isn't going
to stop that from happening.

38:07.244 --> 38:09.124
If you're here to complain
about Hessington Oil,

38:09.129 --> 38:10.329
I had nothing to do with it.

38:10.414 --> 38:11.581
I'm just
the majority shareholder.

38:11.632 --> 38:13.800
I don't get involved
in day-to-day stuff.

38:13.884 --> 38:16.335
- We're not here to complain.
- We're here to bring a gift.

38:16.420 --> 38:17.970
The question is,
what do you get a man

38:18.055 --> 38:19.839
who can burn a $50,000 bond?

38:19.923 --> 38:22.475
Something money can't buy.

38:25.095 --> 38:27.463
- This isn't public.
- It will be in 48 hours.

38:27.514 --> 38:29.798
And it's legal now.
How do you know that?

38:29.850 --> 38:31.317
Because I structured it
that way.

38:31.401 --> 38:34.103
I can do more of the same
for you, but he didn't tell you,

38:34.154 --> 38:36.138
because I wasn't enough
of a name.

38:36.190 --> 38:38.441
- You're not.
- But I am.

38:38.492 --> 38:40.976
Well, you are, as a man
who shoots from the hip,

38:41.028 --> 38:42.161
which I like, but--

38:42.246 --> 38:44.113
You also need
a stabilizing influence.

38:44.164 --> 38:46.866
- Not a football player.
- But a fan of the ballet.

38:46.950 --> 38:49.035
- Muscle.
- And finesse.

38:49.119 --> 38:51.254
And you guys think
that I'm not aware

38:51.321 --> 38:53.372
that this is all
about your merger negotiations.

38:53.457 --> 38:54.757
Oh, I was counting on you
being aware of it.

38:54.824 --> 38:56.008
Because then
you'll also be aware

38:56.093 --> 38:57.460
that we can be very flexible
in our billings.

38:57.511 --> 38:59.178
As long as I pay
enough up front

38:59.263 --> 39:00.930
to tip the scales
in your favor.

39:00.997 --> 39:02.465
We'll structure
a schedule that results

39:02.516 --> 39:04.166
in you getting a substantial
financial benefit.

39:04.218 --> 39:05.801
Which is his specialty.

39:05.853 --> 39:07.303
Go ahead.
Tell him.

39:07.354 --> 39:09.272
He's a badass.

39:11.358 --> 39:13.526
What do you say we celebrate
our new association

39:13.610 --> 39:16.395
over dinner in Chicago
with Michael Jordan?

39:16.480 --> 39:18.197
We can take my private jet.

39:18.282 --> 39:20.199
Hey! Which will allow us
to pay for it

39:20.284 --> 39:21.850
and for you to write it off.

39:35.249 --> 39:37.250
Hey.

39:37.334 --> 39:38.701
Hey.

39:38.752 --> 39:40.753
I know you're probably
busy...

39:40.837 --> 39:42.505
I'm actually not.

39:49.846 --> 39:52.214
Rachel, I...

39:52.266 --> 39:54.016
I know that dating me
is complicated--

39:54.067 --> 39:55.518
- Mike--
- I just--

39:57.721 --> 40:00.856
I just want you to know you can
take as much time as you need.

40:03.744 --> 40:06.195
I love you.

40:09.666 --> 40:11.667
I love you too.

40:17.174 --> 40:19.908
I got into Stanford.

40:30.387 --> 40:33.272
What the hell
is wrong with you?

40:33.357 --> 40:35.257
I see you got
my little gut punch.

40:35.309 --> 40:37.760
I came to you hat in hand,
and this is what you do--

40:37.811 --> 40:39.395
stack the numbers?
- Hat in hand?

40:39.446 --> 40:41.314
More like a wolf
in sheep's clothing.

40:41.398 --> 40:43.950
- What are you talking about?
- Hessington Oil.

40:44.034 --> 40:45.284
I had nothing
to do with that.

40:45.369 --> 40:47.320
Something dropped
from the sky,

40:47.404 --> 40:48.704
tilted everything
in your favor

40:48.772 --> 40:50.990
right after I cut you a break?
I don't think so.

40:51.074 --> 40:53.659
Harvey, I gave you my word,
and I honored it.

40:53.744 --> 40:55.110
Bullshit.
You're saying saying that

40:55.162 --> 40:56.402
because I've got
the upper hand.

40:56.413 --> 40:57.747
This is not
about the upper hand.

40:57.798 --> 40:59.159
You're always
about the upper hand!

40:59.166 --> 41:00.949
Harvey, stop.

41:01.001 --> 41:03.669
I came to you
and asked for mercy.

41:03.754 --> 41:05.671
Do you know how hard
that was for me?

41:05.756 --> 41:08.090
And then for me to turn around
and use that to dupe you--

41:08.141 --> 41:10.092
how could you think
I would do that?

41:10.143 --> 41:11.344
Well, what would you
have thought?

41:11.428 --> 41:13.179
I don't know,
but you could have called me.

41:13.263 --> 41:14.963
- And say what?
- And asked me

41:15.015 --> 41:16.599
to exclude the firing
from the calculations.

41:16.650 --> 41:17.633
I'm not gonna do--

41:17.684 --> 41:19.134
What?
You're not gonna do what?

41:19.186 --> 41:20.826
Not gonna give me
the benefit of the doubt

41:20.854 --> 41:23.572
and be vulnerable--
expose yourself?

41:23.640 --> 41:25.808
I already did that
when I trusted you.

41:25.859 --> 41:29.362
That was mercy, which is
from a position of strength.

41:29.446 --> 41:32.498
Being vulnerable is
from a position of weakness.

41:32.582 --> 41:34.500
Well,
I'm not gonna do that.

41:38.038 --> 41:40.006
Well, then I guess
I'm not going to either.

41:40.090 --> 41:41.824
Meaning what?

41:41.875 --> 41:44.844
Meaning that I am not going
to dissolve this merger.

41:44.928 --> 41:46.512
You already signed
the agreement.

41:46.596 --> 41:48.180
Then sue me.

41:48.265 --> 41:50.332
You're gonna totally
shaft me anyway.

41:50.384 --> 41:51.500
What's my downside?

41:51.551 --> 41:53.886
In the meantime,
you'll have a name partner

41:53.970 --> 41:56.171
who can't practice in America,
whose reputation is shit,

41:56.223 --> 41:58.303
and who's gonna tie up
all your profits in litigation

41:58.308 --> 41:59.525
for the next five years.

41:59.609 --> 42:01.477
You're willing
to do all that

42:01.528 --> 42:03.696
and expect me to believe
you weren't behind

42:03.780 --> 42:05.531
us getting fired
in the first place.

42:05.615 --> 42:07.015
She's telling the truth,
Harvey.

42:07.067 --> 42:08.547
- What?
- Scottie didn't get us fired.

42:08.618 --> 42:10.352
Ava Hessington did.
That doesn't mean anything.

42:10.404 --> 42:11.854
Scottie
could have arranged it.

42:11.905 --> 42:13.322
Well, she didn't,

42:13.373 --> 42:14.907
because Ava
didn't just fire us.

42:14.991 --> 42:17.693
She's suing all of us...

42:17.744 --> 42:19.695
for malpractice.
