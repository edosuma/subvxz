00:24.460 --> 00:28.259
Hello and welcome to
an all-new series of Top Gear.

00:28.260 --> 00:30.299
We're back
and we've been hard at work.

00:30.300 --> 00:34.619
Yeah, and you know how we used to
get a bit big and explodey?

00:34.620 --> 00:39.219
Well, this series we're trying a
quieter, more cerebral approach.

00:39.220 --> 00:40.619
Nah, we're just kidding.

00:40.620 --> 00:41.940
It's still going to be like this.

00:51.300 --> 00:53.059
- Three... - Yeah.

00:53.060 --> 00:54.899
..two...

00:54.900 --> 00:56.539
..one...

00:56.540 --> 00:57.700
..go!

00:58.860 --> 01:01.339
OK, we're up and away.

01:01.340 --> 01:02.620
Ho, ho, ho!

01:05.180 --> 01:07.379
This doesn't look good.
I'm heading on the grass.

01:07.380 --> 01:08.620
Chris has lost control!

01:12.380 --> 01:13.620
Jesus!

01:17.140 --> 01:19.060
Yee-haw!
Go! Go! Go! Go!

01:20.060 --> 01:21.620
How smooth is that?

01:23.660 --> 01:25.739
It feels like it wants to go over.

01:25.740 --> 01:28.180
- Where? - Everywhere.

01:32.300 --> 01:33.900
I can administer a wet willy.

01:35.140 --> 01:38.300
This is like having a child
test the rear seat.

01:42.700 --> 01:45.860
It does 97mph in first gear.

01:47.060 --> 01:48.100
Pow!

01:52.220 --> 01:53.740
I love overtaking!

02:01.460 --> 02:03.259
♪ Ain't no stopping it

02:03.260 --> 02:05.179
♪ Ain't no stopping it

02:05.180 --> 02:07.180
♪ Ain't no stopping it

02:14.860 --> 02:16.340
You just wrecked my tuk-tuk.

02:17.780 --> 02:18.820
Yeah, that's my bad.

02:26.140 --> 02:28.899
OK, all that coming up
over the next few weeks.

02:28.900 --> 02:31.939
But first,
let's talk station wagons.

02:31.940 --> 02:33.659
He means estate cars.

02:33.660 --> 02:36.059
Now, for the last couple of years,

02:36.060 --> 02:40.059
this has been the pick of the bunch,
the benchmark, the Skoda Superb.

02:40.060 --> 02:42.739
Rubbish name, cracking car.

02:42.740 --> 02:45.659
But recently, we've seen a bunch
of new contenders trying to beat

02:45.660 --> 02:47.459
the Skoda at its own game.

02:47.460 --> 02:50.739
So, the producers told Chris and I
to each choose our favourite

02:50.740 --> 02:52.859
practical family station wagon.

02:52.860 --> 02:53.900
Estate car.

02:57.100 --> 02:59.379
And prepare for a series
of challenges

02:59.380 --> 03:02.019
in the land of the Viking.

03:02.020 --> 03:03.540
Shut it.

03:13.620 --> 03:16.179
This is Norway.

03:16.180 --> 03:21.700
Ancient, rugged and home to some
of the world's most stunning roads.

03:23.420 --> 03:28.099
So, when choosing a practical
family estate car to test here,

03:28.100 --> 03:30.340
there was only one choice.

03:32.380 --> 03:34.019
This is what you want.

03:34.020 --> 03:37.619
The Porsche Panamera Turbo
Sport Turismo.

03:37.620 --> 03:40.059
Now, I'll admit at £121,000,

03:40.060 --> 03:44.699
it's the upper limit of the family
estate car market.

03:44.700 --> 03:46.020
But it's pretty cool.

03:47.540 --> 03:51.339
Yes, it's £101,000 more
than your Skoda Superb estate

03:51.340 --> 03:54.140
but you do get a lot more
for your money.

03:56.420 --> 03:58.459
For starters, I've got
four-wheel-drive.

03:58.460 --> 04:02.500
I've got a twin turbo 540hp V8.

04:03.500 --> 04:05.139
I've got it covered here.

04:05.140 --> 04:07.140
I wonder what
Matt's going to turn up in.

04:08.700 --> 04:09.940
He's going to hate this.

04:13.500 --> 04:15.699
I don't believe it.

04:15.700 --> 04:18.978
Ferrari GTC4Lusso.

04:18.980 --> 04:20.819
You git!

04:20.820 --> 04:22.979
And I bet it's the V12, isn't it?

04:22.980 --> 04:24.539
Well, yeah.

04:24.540 --> 04:27.779
That's a £230,000 car.

04:27.780 --> 04:32.979
No, no, it's a £230,000
family estate.

04:32.980 --> 04:34.019
You've cheated!

04:34.020 --> 04:35.659
Well, technically,
we've both cheated.

04:35.660 --> 04:37.300
I just cheated better than you.

04:44.660 --> 04:48.659
So, the Ferrari GTC4Lusso.

04:48.660 --> 04:52.580
Quite possibly the coolest
estate in the world.

04:54.700 --> 05:00.459
It's got a naturally aspirated
V12 engine that makes 690hp.

05:00.460 --> 05:01.659
Or to put it another way,

05:01.660 --> 05:06.939
an entire Skoda Superb
more than Harris's Porsche.

05:06.940 --> 05:11.300
This is a family estate
that'll do 208mph.

05:12.660 --> 05:15.459
And that's the kind of speed
your family will really appreciate.

05:15.460 --> 05:16.859
"Are we there yet, Dad?"

05:16.860 --> 05:18.779
"Are we there yet?
Are we there yet?"

05:18.780 --> 05:21.259
"Yes, as a matter of fact,
we are, son."

05:21.260 --> 05:22.660
"We arrived half an hour ago."

05:26.420 --> 05:29.940
Hey, Chris, what's the 0-60 time
on that Porsche Pananarama?

05:31.180 --> 05:33.179
It's a Panamera.

05:33.180 --> 05:35.139
And it's 3.8 seconds.

05:35.140 --> 05:37.219
This is 3.4 seconds.

05:37.220 --> 05:39.899
And that'll really come in handy
on the school run.

05:39.900 --> 05:42.339
You get an extra 0.4 seconds in bed.

05:42.340 --> 05:45.139
And you know what else you get
for that 230 grand?

05:45.140 --> 05:46.300
Listen to this.

05:58.460 --> 06:01.099
Chris, I can't hear your car.
Is it switched on?

06:01.100 --> 06:02.259
Yeah, very, very funny.

06:02.260 --> 06:03.659
But, more to the point,

06:03.660 --> 06:06.860
the acoustics of tunnels
are actually very, very interesting.

06:08.980 --> 06:12.059
When your tunnel, like this one,
has an uneven surface,

06:12.060 --> 06:15.420
that causes the sound waves
to diffract in random...

06:19.580 --> 06:21.459
Sorry, what did you say?

06:21.460 --> 06:22.700
Stop doing that. I can't...

06:26.100 --> 06:27.540
What?

06:29.820 --> 06:32.939
OK, I'm sorry, I just couldn't help
but refract there.

06:32.940 --> 06:35.059
Now, another interesting point
for you.

06:35.060 --> 06:38.939
Did you know the firing order
of an engine has a huge effect

06:38.940 --> 06:40.139
on how it sounds?

06:40.140 --> 06:43.819
So, for example, this Porsche V8
has a firing order - one, three,

06:43.820 --> 06:46.179
seven, two, six, five, four, eight.

06:46.180 --> 06:48.260
And Ferrari's flat-plane V8
goes - one...

06:58.940 --> 07:03.059
With Norway echoing to the sound
of the world's best and second-best

07:03.060 --> 07:07.220
estate cars, it wasn't long before
we got some local attention.

07:11.660 --> 07:13.579
Hey, look, it's Braveheart.

07:13.580 --> 07:15.340
No, that's a Viking.

07:19.700 --> 07:21.099
What do you think he wants?

07:21.100 --> 07:23.500
I don't know, he's got an axe.
Why don't you go and find out?

07:33.540 --> 07:35.699
Hi. Morning.

07:35.700 --> 07:37.180
Did you ever see Braveheart?

07:39.700 --> 07:41.060
Beautifully handled.

07:45.540 --> 07:46.979
It's from the producers.

07:46.980 --> 07:50.379
It says, "Since you have failed to
bring sensible family estates..."

07:50.380 --> 07:52.579
That's a matter of opinion.

07:52.580 --> 07:55.619
"you might as well head to
Norway's greatest driving road,

07:55.620 --> 07:57.099
the Trollstigen."

07:57.100 --> 07:58.220
Sweet.

07:59.340 --> 08:00.539
That's a...

08:00.540 --> 08:03.819
"However, since you maintain
your cars are practical..."

08:03.820 --> 08:06.019
- Which they are. - One of them is.

08:06.020 --> 08:09.540
"their usefulness
will be tested en route. Now go."

08:13.060 --> 08:14.779
All right, take it easy.

08:14.780 --> 08:15.820
Nice axe.

08:23.340 --> 08:25.699
So, we set off for the Trollstigen,

08:25.700 --> 08:29.259
and determined to prove our cars'
practical credentials,

08:29.260 --> 08:34.020
soon we came across the perfect
place for some in-depth testing.

08:39.340 --> 08:40.860
Yes, baby!

08:42.539 --> 08:43.698
Now, you might be asking,

08:43.700 --> 08:47.579
why do you need this
kind of pace in a family estate car?

08:47.580 --> 08:49.219
Think about it, it'd be practical.

08:49.220 --> 08:50.939
B&amp;Q car park fills up quickly.

08:50.940 --> 08:53.500
You've got to get in there.
You've got to grab that space.

08:55.260 --> 08:57.260
That's why you need the Panamera.

08:59.660 --> 09:02.780
I'm telling you, this is the way
to drop the kids off at school.

09:05.340 --> 09:06.859
No need to park up.

09:06.860 --> 09:11.179
Just kick it into a drift,
open the passenger door,

09:11.180 --> 09:14.179
and the kids can just
jump, tuck and roll.

09:14.180 --> 09:15.940
See? Practical!

09:18.980 --> 09:20.340
Ho, ho, ho!

09:21.340 --> 09:24.659
This four-wheel-drive
system's fantastic

09:24.660 --> 09:27.259
because when I want traction,
the front axle comes with me

09:27.260 --> 09:29.939
and the moment I want to slide
it around, there's a little German

09:29.940 --> 09:33.260
brain in there that says, "Yes,
we will let you oversteer now."

09:36.300 --> 09:39.739
Now, the GTC4 actually has
two gearboxes.

09:39.740 --> 09:42.420
One for the front axle
and one for the rear...

09:44.380 --> 09:47.780
..which means they can send power
to whichever one can use it best.

09:49.100 --> 09:51.539
You don't get that
in a Skoda Superb.

09:51.540 --> 09:54.539
If you'd said to me 15 years ago
I'd be sliding a large Porsche

09:54.540 --> 09:56.819
estate car around, I wouldn't
believe they'd ever build

09:56.820 --> 09:58.339
such a thing.

09:58.340 --> 10:00.819
It's got a pretty good
balance to it.

10:00.820 --> 10:02.419
I mean, it is a big car.

10:02.420 --> 10:03.940
But the motor's just...

10:11.140 --> 10:14.740
That was a sideways LeBlanc
and then a spinning LeBlanc.

10:16.900 --> 10:18.740
She got away from me a little bit.

10:22.820 --> 10:25.859
But then I discovered this
playground came with a very

10:25.860 --> 10:27.020
unique feature.

10:28.700 --> 10:30.300
Hey, Chris, take a look at this.

10:34.820 --> 10:36.299
That looks quite dangerous.

10:36.300 --> 10:38.740
Yeah, get it wrong here,
and you are getting wet.

10:40.420 --> 10:44.140
Which gave me an idea
for an even better practical test.

10:47.460 --> 10:49.979
OK, top speed challenge.

10:49.980 --> 10:53.259
Fast as you can get before
you have to hit the brakes.

10:53.260 --> 10:57.339
Loser is the one who goes slowest,
or ends up in the sea and drowns.

10:57.340 --> 11:00.539
- You ready? - Can I just point out,
this is very unfair?

11:00.540 --> 11:03.899
My top speed, 190mph.

11:03.900 --> 11:06.899
Your top speed, 208mph.

11:06.900 --> 11:07.979
Yeah, I'll go first.

11:07.980 --> 11:10.180
You, er...
You keep an eye out for planes.

11:21.460 --> 11:22.580
There's 100.

11:25.260 --> 11:26.620
There's 130.

11:28.020 --> 11:29.060
Yeah!

11:34.780 --> 11:36.700
177... I'm braking.

11:38.140 --> 11:40.860
Brake! Brake! Brake! Brake! Brake!
Brake! Brake! Brake! Brake! Brake!

11:44.780 --> 11:46.899
Ho, ho, ho, ho!

11:46.900 --> 11:48.859
177 to beat.

11:48.860 --> 11:50.900
Time for the Pananaramadingdong.

11:53.020 --> 11:55.740
Launch control!
That's fierce!

11:59.060 --> 12:00.539
I've got a bit
of a secret weapon here

12:00.540 --> 12:03.580
and I've got 20 seconds of overboost
in sport response mode.

12:07.740 --> 12:09.460
We're still hauling.
We're still hauling.

12:11.740 --> 12:13.020
160.

12:14.820 --> 12:15.980
165.

12:17.500 --> 12:20.220
Brake! Brake! Brake! Brake! Brake!
Brake! Brake! Brake! Brake! Brake!

12:25.100 --> 12:27.700
I wouldn't want to be
much further on than that!

12:32.620 --> 12:33.660
How fast did you go?

12:35.460 --> 12:38.899
First of all,
I definitely braked later than you.

12:38.900 --> 12:40.059
That wasn't the challenge.

12:40.060 --> 12:41.139
How fast did you go?

12:41.140 --> 12:43.459
I think I did 165mph.

12:43.460 --> 12:44.780
OK, that's good.

12:46.460 --> 12:47.579
Come on!

12:47.580 --> 12:48.619
177.

12:48.620 --> 12:50.819
- 177?! - Yeah.

12:50.820 --> 12:53.179
And you braked like a right wuss
as well!

12:53.180 --> 12:54.220
I did, yeah.

12:56.260 --> 12:59.979
You know, if you weren't so
particular about drowning,

12:59.980 --> 13:01.219
you could have won that.

13:01.220 --> 13:02.419
I still braked later than you.

13:02.420 --> 13:04.459
- You did brake later than me.
- I braked later than you.

13:04.460 --> 13:06.100
You should be proud of yourself!

13:11.540 --> 13:16.459
So, after one round of practical
testing the Ferrari had,

13:16.460 --> 13:20.819
well, killed the Porsche,
and Chris needed a win.

13:20.820 --> 13:22.739
OK, let's talk Isofix.

13:22.740 --> 13:26.339
Very important in any
family estate car. OK?

13:26.340 --> 13:27.499
My Porsche has them.

13:27.500 --> 13:28.540
Does your Ferrari?

13:29.700 --> 13:30.739
Yes.

13:30.740 --> 13:32.579
How many?

13:32.580 --> 13:35.099
I'm going, 11.

13:35.100 --> 13:36.180
No.

13:37.740 --> 13:38.779
One?

13:38.780 --> 13:40.500
Do you know what Isofix is?

13:41.620 --> 13:42.659
No.

13:42.660 --> 13:43.699
Who cares?

13:43.700 --> 13:45.899
Isofix is for babies.

13:45.900 --> 13:49.619
Tell me about the fuel
economy in that beautiful V12.

13:49.620 --> 13:53.019
I'd say it's, er, appalling.

13:53.020 --> 13:56.099
It's got to be around
12 miles to the gallon.

13:56.100 --> 13:57.139
How's yours?

13:57.140 --> 13:59.019
About double that. 24.

13:59.020 --> 14:01.659
Double the car,
double the fuel economy.

14:01.660 --> 14:03.779
OK, I'll give him that one.

14:03.780 --> 14:05.580
Look, the Viking's back.

14:16.620 --> 14:18.180
Hello.

14:25.020 --> 14:26.500
Still working that axe?

14:28.980 --> 14:30.699
It's from the producers,
Matthew.

14:30.700 --> 14:33.299
It's time for a boot space
challenge.

14:33.300 --> 14:37.019
The summer solstice is traditionally
marked in Norway with a big bonfire.

14:37.020 --> 14:41.059
You will each load your cars with an
entire tree's worth of firewood

14:41.060 --> 14:44.259
and race to your fjord-side
cabin to build a fire.

14:44.260 --> 14:46.540
Last to arrive fixes dinner.

14:52.220 --> 14:55.019
So, the producers wanted
to test our boot space

14:55.020 --> 14:57.619
and because they think they're
funny, which they're not,

14:57.620 --> 15:00.979
when they said an entire tree's
worth of firewood,

15:00.980 --> 15:02.460
that's exactly what they meant.

15:09.100 --> 15:10.140
Ooh.

15:11.940 --> 15:15.099
That is some green firewood.

15:15.100 --> 15:17.299
I'm glad I brought a proper
estate car, then, Matthew.

15:17.300 --> 15:18.339
One with a boot.

15:18.340 --> 15:19.539
What do you mean?

15:19.540 --> 15:21.299
Go and open the boot
on that Ferrari.

15:21.300 --> 15:22.700
It's absolutely tiny.

15:23.700 --> 15:25.619
Come on.

15:25.620 --> 15:26.659
Look.

15:26.660 --> 15:28.059
Check it out.

15:28.060 --> 15:29.980
It's got room for everything I need.

15:31.020 --> 15:33.179
Have you felt how hot
the boot floor gets?

15:33.180 --> 15:35.499
If you put the family Labrador
in there, it would cook.

15:35.500 --> 15:36.539
Are you done?

15:36.540 --> 15:39.059
Well, look at the leather as well.
So expensive.

15:39.060 --> 15:41.379
How are you going to repair that
when you drag a branch over it?

15:41.380 --> 15:43.059
OK, Chris, on go.

15:43.060 --> 15:44.100
Go!

15:47.220 --> 15:48.259
Sport Turismo boot.

15:48.260 --> 15:51.019
Look at the size of this.
Huge, split-fold rear seats.

15:51.020 --> 15:53.139
So, fold this one down.

15:53.140 --> 15:55.819
Where's my button? There we go.
Fold this one down.

15:55.820 --> 15:57.379
And then apply some science.

15:57.380 --> 15:59.459
Look at this science now. Ready?

15:59.460 --> 16:01.259
How long is the boot?

16:01.260 --> 16:03.379
One, two, three paces.

16:03.380 --> 16:04.419
How long is my tree?

16:04.420 --> 16:06.619
Well, it's twice the size of Matt's,
obviously.

16:06.620 --> 16:10.699
One, two, three, four, five, six,
seven, eight, nine.

16:10.700 --> 16:12.300
Three pieces, I'm in. Let's go!

16:16.220 --> 16:19.899
While Matt channelled
his inner lumberjack,

16:19.900 --> 16:22.260
my approach was much quicker.

16:33.540 --> 16:34.740
See you!

16:35.980 --> 16:38.139
- Where are you going? - Loser.

16:38.140 --> 16:39.580
You left half the tree!

16:41.380 --> 16:44.340
That's not an entire tree's
worth of firewood!

16:46.980 --> 16:48.019
What is LeBlanc doing?

16:48.020 --> 16:51.179
Anyone knows that the key to doing
well in a race is not how fast

16:51.180 --> 16:54.459
you go, it's how little time
you spend stationary.

16:54.460 --> 16:56.819
While he's messing around
creating a beautiful log pile,

16:56.820 --> 16:57.860
I'm moving.

17:01.740 --> 17:04.339
His extra 160hp doesn't mean
anything here.

17:04.339 --> 17:05.699
He's got to get it on to the surface

17:05.700 --> 17:08.180
and I think the Porsche has
a cleverer four-wheel-drive system.

17:09.579 --> 17:12.539
Er, well, I don't know
if all that's going to fit in there.

17:12.540 --> 17:13.779
Oof.

17:13.780 --> 17:16.898
He's going to turn up with
a very neatly arranged log pile

17:16.900 --> 17:18.739
in his very small boot.

17:18.740 --> 17:20.659
I don't know how
he plans to beat me.

17:20.660 --> 17:21.700
Easy.

17:23.260 --> 17:25.540
With a Schliesing 220MX.

17:33.940 --> 17:36.620
This feels absolutely insane!

17:38.220 --> 17:43.460
£150,000, 190mph estate car
on the loose.

17:45.420 --> 17:46.620
I've got this nailed.

17:47.660 --> 17:49.340
Not so fast, Chris.

17:51.740 --> 17:53.700
Come on,
he's got to be here somewhere.

17:56.540 --> 17:59.179
My strategy is clearly the best.

17:59.180 --> 18:01.899
That tree in Harris's car's
never going to stay in there.

18:01.900 --> 18:02.940
Never.

18:03.980 --> 18:07.459
This is the most fun
way to deliver stuff.

18:07.460 --> 18:10.099
I don't know, wood, food, children.

18:10.100 --> 18:12.660
- But then...
- There's a bit of a jump here.

18:16.500 --> 18:17.539
BLEEP.

18:17.540 --> 18:19.379
I'm missing a...

18:19.380 --> 18:21.059
Come on, Harris, where are you?

18:21.060 --> 18:22.859
I know you're hiding.

18:22.860 --> 18:24.180
I can smell you!

18:37.820 --> 18:40.059
Ho, ho, ho, ho!

18:40.060 --> 18:43.299
What happened?

18:43.300 --> 18:45.019
Just a small... Never mind.

18:45.020 --> 18:47.059
I'll see you at the ford...
The fj-... The fj-...

18:47.060 --> 18:48.220
I'll see you at the lake.

18:53.660 --> 18:55.060
Let's go and catch LeBlanc.

19:00.380 --> 19:03.980
Sloppy, sloppy, sloppy, Harris.

19:05.340 --> 19:07.459
Come on, Mr Porsche.

19:07.460 --> 19:09.580
We know you're just
better at everything.

19:13.700 --> 19:15.259
Let's keep the pace up,

19:15.260 --> 19:18.420
because he is going to be right up
my butt in no time, I know it.

19:22.180 --> 19:23.259
I know I'm catching him.

19:23.260 --> 19:25.460
I know I'm quicker on this surface
than him.

19:27.380 --> 19:31.820
His car is worth £300,000,
for crying out loud.

19:33.340 --> 19:34.940
He must be a little bit nervous.

19:37.220 --> 19:38.260
Come on!

19:39.340 --> 19:41.339
This looks like it's fjord-like
down here.

19:41.340 --> 19:42.619
I'm running out of time.

19:42.620 --> 19:44.420
Let's go. Come on.

19:56.780 --> 19:58.019
There you are!

19:58.020 --> 19:59.939
Ha, ha, ha!

19:59.940 --> 20:01.980
Sloppy, sloppy, sloppy.

20:08.940 --> 20:10.579
Congratulations.

20:10.580 --> 20:13.659
Thank you. So, 2-0 to the Ferrari.

20:13.660 --> 20:17.259
And as the loser,
Chris had to fix dinner.

20:17.260 --> 20:19.260
Scandinavian mystery balls.

20:21.500 --> 20:23.659
Hey, what time's it get dark
around here?

20:23.660 --> 20:25.179
It doesn't get dark.

20:25.180 --> 20:28.259
- Never? - Well, around September.

20:28.260 --> 20:31.379
Well, I'm pretty sure I'm going
to need to sleep before September.

20:31.380 --> 20:34.259
- You got any more of those
interesting facts? - Yeah.

20:34.260 --> 20:36.939
IKEA's naming strategy. OK?

20:36.940 --> 20:41.179
So, bookshelves,
coffee tables, now,

20:41.180 --> 20:43.579
they're named after Swedish places.

20:43.580 --> 20:45.500
Yeah, that'll do it. Keep talking.

20:46.820 --> 20:48.779
And, this is the really clever bit.

20:48.780 --> 20:49.899
- Yeah. - You'll love this.

20:49.900 --> 20:51.659
I'm dying.
I'm on the edge of my seat.

20:51.660 --> 20:53.699
Hall furniture and beds.

20:53.700 --> 20:56.460
Now, they're named after
Norwegian places...

21:01.380 --> 21:04.539
And we will pick up that story
a little later in the show.

21:04.540 --> 21:07.339
Now, here's a little game
we play in the office sometimes.

21:07.340 --> 21:11.979
Imagine you've got £100,000 to buy
two new cars to cover all bases.

21:11.980 --> 21:13.139
What do you go for?

21:13.140 --> 21:15.939
OK, well, you've got to go
practicality and performance.

21:15.940 --> 21:20.539
So, I'm thinking Volvo XC90
and a Lotus Elise.

21:20.540 --> 21:22.539
OK, good. But wrong.

21:22.540 --> 21:25.140
Because I've got a much,
much better answer.

21:31.220 --> 21:32.420
Rugged wilderness.

21:33.940 --> 21:35.340
Great driving roads.

21:36.500 --> 21:37.980
Practical urban living.

21:38.900 --> 21:43.899
For £100,000, picking just two cars
to handle everything Britain

21:43.900 --> 21:46.060
has to offer isn't easy.

21:47.220 --> 21:49.700
But I have found the answer.

21:51.420 --> 21:55.819
What you need
is a £15,000 Suzuki Ignis.

21:55.820 --> 21:56.860
And that's it.

21:59.140 --> 22:03.979
Save the rest of your 85 grand
because this is two cars in one.

22:03.980 --> 22:05.420
I mean, it's all the cars in one.

22:06.780 --> 22:08.980
This car does everything.

22:10.460 --> 22:13.099
Bombing around town, tick.

22:13.100 --> 22:15.940
Looking great while
bombing around town, tick.

22:16.980 --> 22:20.139
Charging both my phones
while looking great,

22:20.140 --> 22:23.740
while bombing around
town, tick, tick, tick.

22:25.140 --> 22:27.739
It is quite literally the solution

22:27.740 --> 22:30.020
for anything that Britain
can throw at you.

22:31.020 --> 22:34.859
I mean, come on,
you can't drive two cars anyway.

22:34.860 --> 22:38.419
And with the Ignis you don't
have to nip home to change it

22:38.420 --> 22:40.260
when the open road beckons.

22:46.060 --> 22:49.940
Although, admittedly,
it's not what you'd call quick.

22:51.140 --> 22:55.099
It uses a 1.2 litre engine,
which makes, I don't know,

22:55.100 --> 22:56.619
several horsepower.

22:56.620 --> 23:04.220
It does 0-60 in under 12 seconds
and tops out at 103mph.

23:06.580 --> 23:11.219
But let's be honest, if your 100
grand garage has some 150mph sports

23:11.220 --> 23:15.820
car, you're going to end up spending
even more cash on speeding tickets.

23:18.860 --> 23:22.740
But in the Ignis, it's basically
impossible to get a speeding ticket.

23:24.460 --> 23:27.859
Don't quote me on that,
especially in a court of law.

23:27.860 --> 23:30.979
And in its own leisurely
old-fashioned sort of way,

23:30.980 --> 23:33.340
the Ignis really is a joy to drive.

23:34.260 --> 23:36.339
Look at that weight transfer,

23:36.340 --> 23:39.499
just like you'd get
in an old-school rally car.

23:39.500 --> 23:41.419
Five-speed manual,

23:41.420 --> 23:44.899
same as you'd find in
an old Lambo Diablo, by the way.

23:44.900 --> 23:48.059
Nice to see that technology
trickling down.

23:48.060 --> 23:51.620
It's just a willing, happy,
engaging little car.

23:53.180 --> 23:54.300
Look, there's a sheep...

23:55.300 --> 23:56.380
..overtaking me.

23:59.020 --> 24:03.940
And when the open road runs out,
the Ignis just keeps going.

24:05.460 --> 24:08.699
It's light, it's tough,
it's got good ground clearance,

24:08.700 --> 24:11.340
and most importantly,
it's got four-wheel-drive.

24:13.980 --> 24:18.779
Look at that. Honestly, this thing,
it just skips over the bumps.

24:18.780 --> 24:20.099
It's smooth.

24:20.100 --> 24:23.219
So smooth!

24:23.220 --> 24:27.579
And of course, if you spend 60 grand
on an off-roader, you don't actually

24:27.580 --> 24:30.899
want to take it off-road
in case you scuff it.

24:30.900 --> 24:33.539
If you spend 15 grand
on an off-roader,

24:33.540 --> 24:35.419
you don't mind getting
it dirty. You know?

24:35.420 --> 24:38.179
Even a bit dented.
That's what it was made for.

24:38.180 --> 24:42.179
But the biggest advantage
to only spending 15 grand

24:42.180 --> 24:45.259
on your perfect £100,000 garage?

24:45.260 --> 24:48.499
It leaves you with
loads and loads of money

24:48.500 --> 24:50.499
to spend on whatever you want.

24:50.500 --> 24:51.540
Check it out.

24:52.740 --> 24:56.059
So, I've bought this watch.
Yeah.

24:56.060 --> 24:57.739
I mean, I've already got a watch.

24:57.740 --> 25:00.540
But I figured,
why not have one on each wrist?

25:02.980 --> 25:04.579
Brow.

25:04.580 --> 25:06.099
Thank you.

25:06.100 --> 25:08.420
I also bought a towel man.

25:09.540 --> 25:11.220
I didn't even know that was a thing.

25:12.580 --> 25:14.339
He's very good.

25:14.340 --> 25:16.379
Discreet.

25:16.380 --> 25:17.980
Bit bumpy. Sorry, Dimitri.

25:19.900 --> 25:24.299
You know, maybe it's Dimitri's
steaming mint-scented towelette

25:24.300 --> 25:30.419
talking, but honestly, this really
is all the car you'll ever need.

25:30.420 --> 25:34.579
Your Range Rovers and your Cayennes
get bigger and bigger year on year.

25:34.580 --> 25:36.539
You know what doesn't get bigger?

25:36.540 --> 25:38.979
British countryside.

25:38.980 --> 25:41.459
It's staying the same size.

25:41.460 --> 25:43.299
It has done for years.

25:43.300 --> 25:45.899
The Ignis just fits Britain.

25:45.900 --> 25:48.820
There is nowhere
this car cannot go.

25:49.900 --> 25:53.859
And so I give you, the Suzuki Ignis.

25:53.860 --> 25:57.699
My answer to
the perfect 100 grand garage,

25:57.700 --> 26:01.739
complete with a lot of change
to spare.

26:01.740 --> 26:04.379
Will you start the fans, please?

26:04.380 --> 26:07.500
I have always wanted to do this.

26:15.100 --> 26:16.140
Thanks.

26:18.340 --> 26:19.899
It's from the producers.

26:19.900 --> 26:24.219
It says, "You think your tiny city
car can handle anything?

26:24.220 --> 26:28.819
"Time to prove it. You will drive
to the top of Gurlet Hill."

26:28.820 --> 26:30.379
Which one's that?

26:30.380 --> 26:31.420
That one up there.

26:33.020 --> 26:35.659
- What, that? - The big one.

26:35.660 --> 26:37.659
No, no, that's a mountain, mate.

26:37.660 --> 26:40.339
Apparently, not quite.

26:40.340 --> 26:43.379
At 1,998 feet,

26:43.380 --> 26:48.339
Gurlet Hill falls just two feet
short of mountain status.

26:48.340 --> 26:52.859
And if I could transport two feet's
worth of rocks to the top of it

26:52.860 --> 26:55.739
I would have the honour of
christening Britain's

26:55.740 --> 26:57.299
newest mountain.

26:57.300 --> 26:58.859
Yes!

26:58.860 --> 27:00.099
I like it!

27:00.100 --> 27:04.939
If ever there was a test
for my mini off-roader, this was it.

27:04.940 --> 27:09.939
So I equipped the Ignis with
a smattering of off-road gear

27:09.940 --> 27:13.859
and steeled myself
for the solo ascent.

27:13.860 --> 27:18.020
All right, Ignis, me and you
versus the wilderness.

27:21.740 --> 27:22.979
Hi, buddy!

27:22.980 --> 27:25.419
Sabine, what are you doing?

27:25.420 --> 27:27.820
Beating you to the top
of the hill.

27:29.220 --> 27:31.339
Yes, to make things interesting,

27:31.340 --> 27:34.619
the producers had invited along
some competition.

27:34.620 --> 27:38.939
A ruthless German driving the
reigning champion of the baby SUV

27:38.940 --> 27:41.499
world, the Fiat Panda cross.

27:41.500 --> 27:43.420
OK, bring it!

27:45.420 --> 27:49.740
Jeez, Dimitri, sorry, mate.
Get out, yeah? Towel time's over.

27:51.500 --> 27:52.740
Thanks, buddy. Thanks.

27:56.980 --> 27:58.299
OK, here we go.

27:58.300 --> 27:59.379
Three...

27:59.380 --> 28:00.459
..two...

28:00.460 --> 28:01.499
..one..

28:01.500 --> 28:02.539
..go!

28:02.540 --> 28:03.979
Woo!

28:03.980 --> 28:05.140
Come on, Ignis!

28:06.820 --> 28:08.779
Reid is in the lead!

28:08.780 --> 28:09.859
River!

28:09.860 --> 28:10.939
Aaah!

28:10.940 --> 28:13.619
Mount Ignis or Mount Panda?

28:13.620 --> 28:15.219
Woohoo!

28:15.220 --> 28:16.859
To the mountain!

28:16.860 --> 28:21.499
To claim the name we'd have to
climb over 1,000 vertical feet

28:21.500 --> 28:26.059
up the slopes of Gurlet Hill's
muddy, rocky, moorland terrain,

28:26.060 --> 28:29.299
and that meant the key was to find
a route our cars

28:29.300 --> 28:31.299
could actually handle.

28:31.300 --> 28:33.019
I need a turning, I need a turning.

28:33.020 --> 28:35.339
OK, bye, Rory!

28:35.340 --> 28:36.379
She's gone.

28:36.380 --> 28:38.700
Go, little Panda!

28:41.220 --> 28:42.459
I'm taking this one. Here we go.

28:42.460 --> 28:44.339
Here we go.

28:44.340 --> 28:45.859
I hope this is the way.

28:45.860 --> 28:48.539
Already attacking
the lower slopes...

28:48.540 --> 28:50.059
Second gear!

28:50.060 --> 28:53.739
..Sabine had found herself
a rough but open climb.

28:53.740 --> 28:54.900
Woohoo!

28:56.300 --> 29:00.979
I, on the other hand, was borderline
trespassing through someone's farm.

29:00.980 --> 29:04.619
Which way? Which way? Through here.

29:04.620 --> 29:06.779
Here we go!

29:06.780 --> 29:08.819
A gate? A gate?

29:08.820 --> 29:12.539
But to turn this hill into
a mountain, we each needed the rocks

29:12.540 --> 29:18.659
to do it and the farmer
had kindly left me a ready supply.

29:18.660 --> 29:21.139
Making a mountain!

29:21.140 --> 29:22.619
Sabine, meanwhile...

29:22.620 --> 29:23.660
I need rocks!

29:25.780 --> 29:27.139
..had her own approach.

29:27.140 --> 29:28.860
Sorry, Panda!

29:29.900 --> 29:31.219
One...

29:31.220 --> 29:35.739
That's for my Mount Panda!

29:35.740 --> 29:37.380
Yeah!

29:38.980 --> 29:42.739
Rocks aboard, it was time to leave
the lower slopes behind

29:42.740 --> 29:46.899
and make a break for the wide open
moorland that led to the summit.

29:46.900 --> 29:49.260
My God, that thing's massive!

29:50.580 --> 29:54.379
Wide open moorland, which, it turned
out, could only be reached

29:54.380 --> 29:55.939
through one narrow gate.

29:55.940 --> 29:57.299
There's Sabine!

29:57.300 --> 29:58.339
No!

29:58.340 --> 30:01.459
Aaahh! She's got in front of me!

30:01.460 --> 30:02.740
Come on, Ignis!

30:04.820 --> 30:06.699
Now well on our way to the
top of the hill,

30:06.700 --> 30:10.619
our intrepid little off-roaders
would have to tackle terrain that

30:10.620 --> 30:13.180
would test even the biggest
and toughest 4x4s.

30:15.420 --> 30:18.059
And the Panda was in trouble.

30:18.060 --> 30:20.659
She's stuck! Come on, baby!

30:20.660 --> 30:23.859
No, no, no, no! Don't get stuck.
Don't get stuck. Do not get stuck.

30:23.860 --> 30:25.659
Do not get stuck. Come on, come on!

30:25.660 --> 30:27.139
Come on, come on, come on, come on.

30:27.140 --> 30:28.540
That's not fair!

30:29.900 --> 30:32.940
- Come on! - Yeah! We're moving!

30:34.740 --> 30:37.059
And she's not!

30:37.060 --> 30:39.100
I'm too heavy!

30:40.860 --> 30:43.219
I have found me a trail.

30:43.220 --> 30:45.819
Leaving Sabine bogged down,
the Ignis

30:45.820 --> 30:47.580
and I could make a break for it.

30:49.380 --> 30:51.939
No! Panda.

30:51.940 --> 30:55.020
And forced to ditch weight to get
herself moving...

30:57.420 --> 30:59.299
This trail is a disaster.

30:59.300 --> 31:02.459
..while Team Panda had some serious
catching up to do...

31:02.460 --> 31:04.939
Come on, Panda! Yee-ha!

31:04.940 --> 31:06.180
Go, go, go, go!

31:07.340 --> 31:12.059
..Team Ignis were making
effortless progress... ish.

31:12.060 --> 31:15.340
Yeah, I know that looks bad,
but it's...

31:16.500 --> 31:17.740
Hang on!

31:19.220 --> 31:21.700
Yes, the climb was punishing
both our cars.

31:25.660 --> 31:27.099
No!

31:27.100 --> 31:28.579
But despite punctures...

31:28.580 --> 31:30.019
I don't need you any more.

31:30.020 --> 31:31.379
..and a few knocks...

31:31.380 --> 31:32.860
Argh!

31:33.860 --> 31:38.259
..OK, a lot of knocks -
they kept pushing forward,

31:38.260 --> 31:41.460
and best of all,
the Ignis was still in front.

31:46.940 --> 31:49.379
Gurlet Hill wasn't done yet.

31:49.380 --> 31:52.699
With 440 feet left to climb,

31:52.700 --> 31:56.859
I reached a towering ravine
and the steepest part of the ascent.

31:56.860 --> 31:59.139
Holy...
I might need help with this.

31:59.140 --> 32:02.219
Luckily, I had just
the tools for the job.

32:02.220 --> 32:03.540
Land anchor!

32:04.700 --> 32:10.219
Yes! The automotive equivalent
of an ice pick and a climbing rope.

32:10.220 --> 32:12.580
I saw this on YouTube once.
Can't be that hard.

32:13.860 --> 32:16.499
There's a lot you can learn
off the internet.

32:16.500 --> 32:20.299
We are moving! We are moving.

32:20.300 --> 32:23.139
All right. Next leg. Yeah.

32:23.140 --> 32:26.100
The winner was going to have to
haul themselves to the top.

32:27.820 --> 32:31.099
And already,
three winch lengths in... Sabine!

32:31.100 --> 32:33.899
..I had a massive lead.

32:33.900 --> 32:35.499
For a minute.

32:35.500 --> 32:38.219
Yeah! Get out of my way! Yeah!

32:38.220 --> 32:41.619
- No, no! - Yeah!

32:41.620 --> 32:43.939
No!

32:43.940 --> 32:45.339
How did you get up here?

32:45.340 --> 32:46.699
I'm in the lead!

32:46.700 --> 32:50.379
- But thankfully, the Panda could
drive no further. -!

32:50.380 --> 32:52.660
It was Sabine's turn to start
winching.

32:54.580 --> 32:58.219
And with the summit now just 37
land anchors away...

32:58.220 --> 33:00.739
Get off my car, get off my car!

33:00.740 --> 33:04.619
..so began the slowest drag
race in history.

33:04.620 --> 33:08.379
Welcome to Top Gear,
where a small Fiat

33:08.380 --> 33:12.580
and a small Suzuki are driving very
slowly up a hill.

33:16.060 --> 33:18.420
We inched our cars higher
and higher.

33:20.620 --> 33:25.899
Until eventually - like, really,
really eventually...

33:25.900 --> 33:28.939
She's gaining, she's gaining.

33:28.940 --> 33:31.259
..we made it to the top of the
ravine.

33:31.260 --> 33:32.339
Come on, come on.

33:32.340 --> 33:35.259
And with just the last short
dash to the summit left...

33:35.260 --> 33:37.379
I'm coming, Rory.

33:37.380 --> 33:40.740
..it was go time.
We're motoring now, baby.

33:42.300 --> 33:45.139
There's the summit. I can see it.

33:45.140 --> 33:46.979
That's what I'm talking about.

33:46.980 --> 33:48.379
Come on, Ignis.

33:48.380 --> 33:51.819
OK, little Panda. Full power.

33:51.820 --> 33:55.339
Come on, baby. Come on, baby.
Come on. Come on!

33:55.340 --> 33:57.899
Argh!

33:57.900 --> 34:01.780
- Not now. - Rory, I catch you!

34:03.460 --> 34:04.579
Stuck!

34:04.580 --> 34:07.779
Woo, hoo, ooh! Yeah!

34:07.780 --> 34:10.139
- No, no! - Bye-bye!

34:10.139 --> 34:11.659
Argh!

34:11.659 --> 34:13.339
- Yeah! - No!

34:13.340 --> 34:15.580
See you later, alligator!

34:16.659 --> 34:19.100
I'm not letting her win.
I am not letting her win.

34:21.179 --> 34:23.060
Maybe if I go backwards?

34:25.380 --> 34:27.739
Yes, yes! It's working.

34:29.420 --> 34:31.100
Come on! Up the hill.

34:34.100 --> 34:35.900
Yes! I found a route!

34:38.179 --> 34:39.739
Ooh!

34:45.260 --> 34:47.179
I need another plan!

34:48.620 --> 34:50.219
No, no, no. I need a miracle.

34:50.219 --> 34:52.619
Ha-ha! Woohoo!

34:52.620 --> 34:54.139
I'm nearly there!

34:55.139 --> 34:58.940
Yes, Sabine and the Panda had
reached the summit.

35:00.180 --> 35:02.019
Woohoo!

35:02.020 --> 35:03.460
Little Panda.

35:05.380 --> 35:08.540
Yes!!

35:12.660 --> 35:17.659
But as she staked her claim
for Britain's newest mountain...

35:17.660 --> 35:19.459
Ta-dah!

35:19.460 --> 35:22.539
Mount Panda!

35:22.540 --> 35:25.899
..there was one last ray of hope
for the Ignis.

35:25.900 --> 35:27.419
That's not two feet.

35:27.420 --> 35:31.899
I'm on top of my own mountain!
Mount Panda.

35:31.900 --> 35:33.539
Hang on a minute.

35:33.540 --> 35:35.099
What's wrong?

35:35.100 --> 35:38.139
You do realise we are
supposed to build

35:38.140 --> 35:39.939
an extra two feet
on top of this hill

35:39.940 --> 35:41.619
in order for it to be a mountain?

35:41.620 --> 35:44.859
Man. Come on. You don't want to
lose. You're a bad loser.

35:44.860 --> 35:46.779
- No, no, no, no. We've got...
- You are a bad loser.

35:46.780 --> 35:49.499
No, we have to do this properly,
otherwise, it's not a mountain.

35:49.500 --> 35:52.740
Yeah, no problem. Look.

35:58.420 --> 36:00.659
- It's 19.5 inches. - Aw!

36:00.660 --> 36:02.499
- It's not enough. - OK.

36:02.500 --> 36:03.979
It's not a mountain.

36:03.980 --> 36:06.579
Sabine was 4.5 inches short.

36:06.580 --> 36:08.139
Come, give me your rocks.

36:08.140 --> 36:10.659
I'm not sure you understand how this
works. We're not a team.

36:10.660 --> 36:13.579
- We are competing against each other.
- No, no.

36:13.580 --> 36:17.059
But with negotiation skills that
would put Brexit to shame...

36:17.060 --> 36:21.219
- Mount Igna. - Igna? No, no, no.
Panda must be the first letter.

36:21.220 --> 36:23.299
It's not my fault you didn't
collect your rocks.

36:23.300 --> 36:27.059
We agreed to raid the Ignis
for a little extra altitude...

36:27.060 --> 36:29.979
- I can't believe I'm actually
helping you win. - Yes.

36:29.980 --> 36:32.659
..and settled on a result.

36:32.660 --> 36:35.459
- 38 inches. - Yes. - That's a mountain.
- Yes!

36:35.460 --> 36:38.459
Britain's newest
mountain would be named...

36:38.460 --> 36:41.900
- That is Mount Pagnis.
- Pagnis! - Come on!

36:43.620 --> 36:46.260
- Woohoo! - Mount Pagnis!

36:49.180 --> 36:50.979
That was exhausting.

36:50.980 --> 36:52.299
Can I have a lift down?

36:52.300 --> 36:54.780
- Sure. - All right. - Your car's BLEEP.

37:06.660 --> 37:09.339
Sabine may have won, but credit
where credit's due -

37:09.340 --> 37:10.939
that was genuinely impressive.

37:10.940 --> 37:15.579
Yeah, you know. Build a mountain
with my bare hands. No big deal.

37:15.580 --> 37:17.579
In my house, we call that Tuesday.

37:17.580 --> 37:20.899
Yeah, except you didn't actually
build a mountain, did you?

37:20.900 --> 37:23.740
Well, er, kind of ish...

37:25.500 --> 37:28.379
What did the people from the
Ordnance Survey say? Come on.

37:28.380 --> 37:29.859
They said stop phoning us.

37:29.860 --> 37:32.259
And...?

37:32.260 --> 37:34.819
Well, they said that dumping
a bunch of rocks in a spare

37:34.820 --> 37:37.419
wheel on top of a hill doesn't
officially make something

37:37.420 --> 37:38.819
a mountain. Like they'd know!

37:38.820 --> 37:40.499
What was the exact phrase they used?

37:40.500 --> 37:43.139
Fly-tipping.

37:43.140 --> 37:44.339
Matt?

37:44.340 --> 37:48.339
OK, now it's time to put
a Star In A Reasonably Fast Car.

37:48.340 --> 37:52.179
Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome
star of X-Men, 30 Rock

37:52.180 --> 37:54.260
and Westworld, James Marsden.

37:55.700 --> 37:57.140
Yeah!

37:58.700 --> 38:00.660
How are you, sir? OK, OK.

38:07.220 --> 38:09.899
Welcome to the show. Thanks
for coming all the way from LA.

38:09.900 --> 38:12.579
This is cool, man. This is a show
I've watched for ages

38:12.580 --> 38:15.099
and now I'm sitting here with you
guys, it's pretty damn cool.

38:15.100 --> 38:16.899
Because you've always been a car
guy, right?

38:16.900 --> 38:21.539
I mean, I... Yeah. I guess every guy
is, like, "I love cars," but to me,

38:21.540 --> 38:25.459
I grew up in Oklahoma in a pretty
rural part of Oklahoma City,

38:25.460 --> 38:29.659
and was driving when I probably
shouldn't be driving. 14.

38:29.660 --> 38:31.019
We sort of have it backwards there.

38:31.020 --> 38:34.139
We can drive at 16 but you have to
wait to 21 to drink.

38:34.140 --> 38:35.579
I think it sort of should be
reversed,

38:35.580 --> 38:38.059
but I was driving back
rural roads on,

38:38.060 --> 38:41.579
you know, gravel roads in my mom's
'78 Oldsmobile Cutlass,

38:41.580 --> 38:45.459
figuring out what counter steer
is. "This is fun!"

38:45.460 --> 38:49.339
- Yeah, some of my best times were in
a car. - Doing crazy stuff?

38:49.340 --> 38:52.659
Yeah, some incriminating things,
actually, I think.

38:52.660 --> 38:55.139
Hopefully the statute of limitations
is past, but I was...

38:55.140 --> 38:58.179
- Yeah, we're a small island off
Europe. It doesn't matter here.
- Yeah, bring it!

38:58.180 --> 39:00.979
Great. Well, I won't go back to the
States! I'll stay here.

39:00.980 --> 39:02.819
No, my buddies and I,
once I got, you know,

39:02.820 --> 39:04.779
you get your licence
and then you're off.

39:04.780 --> 39:06.859
Like, if you're lucky
enough to have a car,

39:06.860 --> 39:09.219
but we, um, we were
so bored during the summers,

39:09.220 --> 39:12.219
we would look through the classified
ads for cars for sale,

39:12.220 --> 39:14.979
and we would target cars that were
just two seaters,

39:14.980 --> 39:18.699
in the hope that the owner would be,
like, "You boys go take it for a
test drive."

39:18.700 --> 39:22.019
And we would take these cars
and learn how to drive them -

39:22.020 --> 39:24.899
a manual gearbox, and, you know,
find puddles and right-hand turns

39:24.900 --> 39:27.499
and let the tail-end go out
and, you know, bring the car back.

39:27.500 --> 39:28.859
And they'd trust you to do that?

39:28.860 --> 39:30.739
80% of the time, yeah.
And we'd bring it back.

39:30.740 --> 39:35.339
We'd sort of dress up nice and be,
like, "I don't know.

39:35.340 --> 39:36.739
"We have to take it for a spin."

39:36.740 --> 39:38.579
You know, some 16-year-old!
But, um...

39:38.580 --> 39:40.179
They couldn't have been great cars!

39:40.180 --> 39:43.099
- Well, it was like RX-7s,
and, you know, and... - Really?

39:43.100 --> 39:45.219
Any car that slides is a great car.
You know that?

39:45.220 --> 39:50.059
- This is true, yeah, yeah.
- Yeah, yeah. I think we took out
a 928 once. Er, yeah. Yeah!

39:50.060 --> 39:54.579
- We wouldn't thrash them, obviously,
but we would... We would thrash
them. - Yeah, exactly!

39:54.580 --> 39:57.179
That's not the craziest thing you
and your buddies did, is it?

39:57.180 --> 40:00.299
Like I said, there wasn't a lot
going on in Oklahoma during the

40:00.300 --> 40:02.179
summers, so we would get bored,

40:02.180 --> 40:04.379
and we had this game
we played where, if you, like,

40:04.380 --> 40:07.219
the Vulcan neck pinch, where if you
pinch one of your buddies' neck, no

40:07.220 --> 40:09.859
matter what they were doing, they'd
have to stop what they were doing.

40:09.860 --> 40:13.259
So at speed sometimes,
high speeds occasionally, we would

40:13.260 --> 40:15.219
think it would be funny to come
up behind the driver

40:15.220 --> 40:17.779
and pinch his neck, and
if that happened, you had to stop,

40:17.780 --> 40:19.900
like, even going 100mph,
you'd just drop.

40:21.740 --> 40:25.379
And then the friend in the passenger
seat, "Take the wheel,
take the wheel!"

40:25.380 --> 40:28.139
By the way, I don't... I don't
condone this behaviour

40:28.140 --> 40:31.419
or encourage this kind of behaviour
at home, or anywhere else.

40:31.420 --> 40:33.139
I do. That sounds like fun!

40:33.140 --> 40:36.139
All right, let's take a look
at your training lap with Chris.

40:36.140 --> 40:37.819
How did that go out there?
What do you think?

40:37.820 --> 40:40.019
It was... I don't know. You tell me.
I don't remember it.

40:40.020 --> 40:43.659
I'm not good at doing two or three,
what, three things at once.

40:43.660 --> 40:47.099
You were a heady combination
of nerves, ambition, terror

40:47.100 --> 40:49.499
and sitting on the wrong
side of the car.

40:49.500 --> 40:52.739
That was... I don't want to...
I don't want to look for any
excuses, but that did...

40:52.740 --> 40:54.579
- It's a tough gig. - That stymied me.

40:54.580 --> 40:57.259
But I could tell from the start
that there was talent there.

40:57.260 --> 40:59.019
So let's see it.
Come on, let's see it.

40:59.020 --> 41:02.260
- All right, let's take a look. - All
right. Don't build me up too much,
Buttercup!

41:03.820 --> 41:06.299
James,
welcome to the Top Gear test drive.

41:06.300 --> 41:08.139
Thank you very much.
Thanks for having me.

41:08.140 --> 41:09.859
- I know that you're...
- I'm not nervous.

41:09.860 --> 41:11.659
I know you've wanted to come
here for a while.

41:11.660 --> 41:13.179
I have been, yes. I've been...

41:13.180 --> 41:16.059
The last 10 years of my life,
I've been watching this show

41:16.060 --> 41:19.379
and seeing you guys kicking butt
the last couple of years.

41:19.380 --> 41:21.339
I've always thought - you know,
you always think,

41:21.340 --> 41:24.379
"I'm a competitive person,"
so you look at the leaderboard,

41:24.380 --> 41:26.659
and you want to be atop it.

41:26.660 --> 41:29.779
I'm hoping I can get up there,
but I'm also realistic about my...

41:29.780 --> 41:31.779
Before we've even started,
you're telling me

41:31.780 --> 41:33.419
you want to be at the top
of the leaderboard!

41:33.420 --> 41:36.499
- Did I say that?
- Yeah. But that's the challenge, OK.
- That may just be jet lag.

41:36.500 --> 41:39.539
- That might alter my behaviour. Let's
get going. I'm going to push you.
- All right.

41:39.540 --> 41:42.979
- Go. Give it some beans.
Give it some beans! - All right! - Go!

41:42.980 --> 41:44.579
Push me. But I need you to push me.

41:44.580 --> 41:47.539
Third gear. Don't... Don't shift
till that red light comes on.

41:47.540 --> 41:48.819
- All right. - Wait for the red.

41:48.820 --> 41:51.779
Wait for the red light. There you
go. Let her sing.

41:51.780 --> 41:54.339
Do you do any of your own stunt
driving or not?

41:54.340 --> 41:56.619
- Er, clearly not!
- Yeah, you'd be good enough.

41:56.620 --> 41:59.259
- There's the grass!
- He's using all the track!

41:59.260 --> 42:02.139
- And what are you going to do before
the tyres? - Brake in second.

42:02.140 --> 42:04.780
- You are. - Did I get it?
- No, that's fourth.

42:06.780 --> 42:08.819
That's second. Yes!

42:08.820 --> 42:10.219
Round to the right-hand side.

42:10.220 --> 42:13.339
Whoo! Come on, let's let them
loose a little bit.

42:13.340 --> 42:17.419
Did you see those snakelike
reactions on the oversteer? Amazing!

42:17.420 --> 42:19.979
- Good, good. - Second? Third?
- Third. - BLEEP.

42:19.980 --> 42:22.099
Round to the left, round to the
left. Leave it in third.

42:22.100 --> 42:24.259
Leave it in third.
That's good. You can carry third.

42:24.260 --> 42:26.979
Get the clutch out, get the clutch
out. Don't dip the clutch there.

42:26.980 --> 42:28.939
Hammerhead,
the notorious Hammerhead.

42:28.940 --> 42:30.099
The notorious Hammerhead.

42:30.100 --> 42:32.299
Does it look as glamorous as you
thought it would?

42:32.300 --> 42:34.819
Er, it...! I didn't see it go by.

42:34.820 --> 42:37.379
This is good. Flat down, flat down,
flat down. I can see that foot.

42:37.380 --> 42:39.579
Get that foot in that footwell.

42:39.580 --> 42:42.739
Fourth gear. That's good. Woohoo!

42:42.740 --> 42:45.139
Jesus,
this feels like it's going to roll.

42:45.140 --> 42:48.139
OK. What's the fastest you've
been in a motor car until now?

42:48.140 --> 42:51.179
Um, what? 140mph.

42:51.180 --> 42:54.459
- On the track or on the road?
- In a 1979 Camaro.

42:54.460 --> 42:57.419
- Brake, brake, brake! - Third, break.
- That's good, that's good.
That's good.

42:57.420 --> 42:59.500
What's your favourite
car in a film ever?

43:00.860 --> 43:03.739
Er, favourite car in a film. We're
going off the track here.

43:03.740 --> 43:07.139
- Talk and drive, talk and drive. -
I can't...! The Judge, The Judge!

43:07.140 --> 43:10.499
The Judge! The Judge! Over the line.
That's good. OK, let's stop there.

43:10.500 --> 43:12.379
Let's stop there.

43:12.380 --> 43:15.419
- Talking of driving... - It really is,
like, can you do four things at
once?

43:15.420 --> 43:17.939
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
It's that, it's that one, isn't it?

43:17.940 --> 43:20.100
It is, man.

43:21.780 --> 43:25.099
Good. I don't remember any of that.

43:25.100 --> 43:28.019
- I was so... I was so calm.
- He's very distracting.

43:28.020 --> 43:30.779
Yeah, you asked me
what my favourite car in a film was.

43:30.780 --> 43:34.179
I was, like, "What's a car?"
I don't know what a car is!

43:34.180 --> 43:36.259
- Well, I'm...
- I was just trying not to die!

43:36.260 --> 43:39.579
My job is to coach you and distract
you. It's quite a strange role.

43:39.580 --> 43:42.259
Well, you achieved that.

43:42.260 --> 43:46.499
OK, let's get back to cars. At the
start, what was your first car?

43:46.500 --> 43:51.580
Er, my very first car was
a 1986 Pontiac Firebird.

43:52.580 --> 43:56.219
Um, it was a V8 350hp V-8
that was...

43:56.220 --> 43:59.379
all power to the rear wheels
and, you know,

43:59.380 --> 44:04.219
it was easy to let things slide
into kerbs, which I did frequently.

44:04.220 --> 44:05.339
I was 16 when I had it,

44:05.340 --> 44:08.059
so I thought it would be cool to
call it the Lovebird.

44:08.060 --> 44:11.939
- Ooh! - Yeah, yeah. It wasn't that
cool. It turns out...

44:11.940 --> 44:16.459
It turns out that was one of the
reasons why I didn't have a
girlfriend! Um...

44:16.460 --> 44:19.139
And then after that,
how did you replace the Lovebird?

44:19.140 --> 44:21.899
I graduated in '91, dating myself,

44:21.900 --> 44:27.419
- but I was given as a graduation gift
a '91 Honda Accord, like, burgundy.
- Ooh!

44:27.420 --> 44:29.419
- Yeah. - And did the love life improve,
or...?

44:29.420 --> 44:32.179
- I got sensible and boring. - Yeah.

44:32.180 --> 44:35.299
- Not as much spirit or soul as the...
- No.

44:35.300 --> 44:37.379
The Lovebird. But, er,...

44:37.380 --> 44:39.419
But then you had another Accord,
right, after that?

44:39.420 --> 44:43.259
- I did, yeah. It sounds like I loved
the Accord, but when I decided...
- Ooh!

44:43.260 --> 44:45.219
- That one's nice. I like that one.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

44:45.220 --> 44:48.859
I always love it when you take
a sensible, dependable car,

44:48.860 --> 44:52.219
and sport it up with louvres or
a spoiler like that.

44:52.220 --> 44:54.379
But louvres actually mean
something in your country,

44:54.380 --> 44:56.219
cos you have sun.

44:56.220 --> 44:58.619
We had louvres in the '80s,
but we didn't have the sun.

44:58.620 --> 45:00.699
- I don't understand why we had them.
- What, is that...?

45:00.700 --> 45:03.019
I still do this day don't know
what they're used for.

45:03.020 --> 45:05.339
- Is it just for blocking sun out?
- Downforce, mate.

45:05.340 --> 45:07.099
- Artificial downforce. - Downforce.

45:07.100 --> 45:09.739
Yeah, yeah. And getting chicks!

45:09.740 --> 45:10.899
I mean, look at that baby.

45:10.900 --> 45:13.820
Probably be quite helpful for BLEEP
as well. If you look at it...

45:16.180 --> 45:19.179
But I drove to LA
when I decided to be an actor.

45:19.180 --> 45:22.779
I moved in '93 to LA and I drove
out in that car, listening to Don

45:22.780 --> 45:25.459
McLean's American Pie on a loop,
trying to remember the lyrics.

45:25.460 --> 45:27.299
You know, the Firebird was
fun for a while,

45:27.300 --> 45:29.659
but that was, like,
the sensible car.

45:29.660 --> 45:33.539
So you have actually owned a couple
of British classics, haven't you?

45:33.540 --> 45:36.339
I had a little patch where my son
was getting into cars.

45:36.340 --> 45:39.379
He was seven, eight, maybe nine,
something like that, so I was, like,

45:39.380 --> 45:43.259
let's get an old classic and sort
of share working on it with him.

45:43.260 --> 45:46.779
There was a little car show nearby
where we lived at Bob's Big Boy -
like, a diner.

45:46.780 --> 45:49.339
- I've been there, I've been there.
- You've been there, yeah.

45:49.340 --> 45:51.499
- You two go to a place
called Bob's Big Boys? - Yeah.

45:51.500 --> 45:55.179
- No, no. No. Bob's Big Boy.
- Big Boy. - It's a burger joint.

45:55.180 --> 45:58.299
- Being singular doesn't make it
any better, Matt!

45:58.300 --> 46:01.739
Bob's Big Boys has a whole other
meaning, doesn't it?

46:01.740 --> 46:04.619
Um, yeah, so I bought a 1960...

46:04.620 --> 46:08.699
I think it was a 1964 MG Midget,
in, like, British racing green

46:08.700 --> 46:11.620
and I like to buy cars
that make me look bigger.

46:13.020 --> 46:14.619
Obviously!

46:14.620 --> 46:15.939
And then, after that,

46:15.940 --> 46:20.579
- I had a '67 Austin Healey BJ8 3000
for a little while. -!

46:20.580 --> 46:22.579
Another British racing green,
a little darker,

46:22.580 --> 46:26.339
but I couldn't afford the
Jag E-type, so I went for the, er...

46:26.340 --> 46:28.739
- All right. - I went for the Healey.

46:28.740 --> 46:31.299
I think it's time we take
a look at your lap out there.

46:31.300 --> 46:34.979
- What do you think? - Do we have to?
- You've flown a long way to do this.

46:34.980 --> 46:39.299
Yeah. Yeah, yeah. I've waited many
years to try this out.

46:39.300 --> 46:41.339
It always looks easier
when you're watching TV.

46:41.340 --> 46:42.979
Was it easier without him
screaming at you,

46:42.980 --> 46:45.540
- asking you dumb questions
all the time? - No offence, but, yes.

46:46.820 --> 46:49.259
- Let's take a look. Come on. - Hey.

46:49.260 --> 46:51.179
Off the line.

46:51.180 --> 46:52.939
That's a good start, James.

46:52.940 --> 46:55.100
♪ Just some good ol' boys

46:59.020 --> 47:01.139
Urgh, late brake here!

47:01.140 --> 47:02.779
OK, enough of the Dukes of Hazzard.

47:02.780 --> 47:05.259
What's the line like?
The line is good.

47:05.260 --> 47:07.660
Looks like them Duke boys
are up to no good!

47:10.900 --> 47:13.339
Now, this was the one you were
struggling with earlier.

47:13.340 --> 47:16.419
Braking, that's good.
Second gear now.

47:16.420 --> 47:18.339
What's the line like here?
That's pretty good.

47:18.340 --> 47:20.659
Running wide there to let
the car build speed.

47:20.660 --> 47:22.739
We're going to need a faster car!

47:22.740 --> 47:25.619
You didn't say that
when I was in there, did you? Third.

47:25.620 --> 47:27.619
Come on, you BLEEP!

47:27.620 --> 47:30.059
Fourth. Braking, this looks good.

47:30.060 --> 47:33.340
Lot of roll on the car,
roll is good, roll equals speed.

47:34.420 --> 47:37.539
You sort of V'd the corner off
a bit there.

47:37.540 --> 47:40.499
Now you're still getting wide
and carrying speed.

47:40.500 --> 47:41.699
Now, the Follow Through.

47:41.700 --> 47:43.779
Aagh! That's first!

47:43.780 --> 47:45.339
It's in there.

47:45.340 --> 47:47.179
Damn!

47:47.180 --> 47:49.779
Damn having to shift
with the left!

47:49.780 --> 47:52.939
Very good costume drama
English accent.

47:52.940 --> 47:55.339
Through the Follow Through,
that looked faster.

47:55.340 --> 47:59.859
Can't pick my nose with my left
hand, much less find third gear!

47:59.860 --> 48:03.379
Brake lights...
Not even a hint of brake lights.

48:03.380 --> 48:05.219
Don't know what that noise was.

48:05.220 --> 48:06.579
Let you off slow...

48:06.580 --> 48:08.659
Like the raptor in Jurassic Park!

48:08.660 --> 48:11.699
Second to last,
through, using all the track.

48:11.700 --> 48:14.259
No idea what gear I'm in,
cos I'm using my left hand...

48:14.260 --> 48:16.859
- Gambon, what's he going to be like?
- ..not my right!

48:16.860 --> 48:20.019
Big flourish over the line.
That was fast!

48:20.020 --> 48:22.300
That looked fast.

48:27.540 --> 48:31.299
Like the car... Like the car,
it looked reasonably fast.

48:31.300 --> 48:34.619
- I think that looked pretty quick.
- Where would you like to be?

48:34.620 --> 48:39.099
I would love to be sub 1.40,
but I'm not sure I broke that.

48:39.100 --> 48:41.579
- Sub 1.40? Yeah, might be too...
- He's aiming high!

48:41.580 --> 48:43.419
Maybe sub 1.44, how about that?

48:43.420 --> 48:45.579
Sub 1.44?!

48:45.580 --> 48:47.979
I don't know, is that good or bad?

48:47.980 --> 48:51.779
Sorry, sorry, sorry.
Sub 1.50.

48:51.780 --> 48:54.059
No, no, the other way,
the other way, up!

48:54.060 --> 48:55.539
The other way, up! All right.

48:55.540 --> 48:57.499
I mean, that's where
you want to be, right?

48:57.500 --> 48:59.459
You want to be right at the top,
I think.

48:59.460 --> 49:01.979
No, I feel like, you know,
I'm cosy right there in the middle.

49:01.980 --> 49:03.939
Can you just read out the time?!

49:03.940 --> 49:06.219
All right.

49:06.220 --> 49:08.499
James Marsden,
you went around our track

49:08.500 --> 49:09.900
in one minute...

49:11.860 --> 49:12.979
..30...

49:12.980 --> 49:15.459
- Ooh!
- Happy there.

49:15.460 --> 49:17.019
- ..9...
- Ooh!

49:17.020 --> 49:18.859
- ..flat.
- OK!

49:18.860 --> 49:21.379
- That's good. - I'll take that.

49:21.380 --> 49:24.059
- That is good.
- That is a great effort.

49:24.060 --> 49:25.419
Well done.

49:25.420 --> 49:29.939
Do I get a handicap for setting
off with the right hand driving?

49:29.940 --> 49:33.459
- That was good, that was really good.
- I'll take it. - Yeah. - I'll take it.

49:33.460 --> 49:36.099
Ladies and gentlemen, James Marsden!

49:36.100 --> 49:40.580
- Thank you. Good to see you.
- Good job! - Have a good one.

49:42.060 --> 49:43.420
I like that guy.

49:45.300 --> 49:47.819
OK, now it's time
to get back to Norway,

49:47.820 --> 49:50.139
where, as you'll remember,
Chris and I were testing

49:50.140 --> 49:53.859
a pair of practical, everyday
family station wagons...

49:53.860 --> 49:55.419
Estate cars.

49:55.420 --> 49:58.099
OK! ..from Porsche and Ferrari.

49:58.100 --> 50:02.019
And we were closing in on one
of Europe's greatest driving roads,

50:02.020 --> 50:03.700
the Trollstigen.

50:08.380 --> 50:10.540
A few hours later,
we got back on the road.

50:12.060 --> 50:16.219
And stats man Harris was still
rolling out the facts.

50:16.220 --> 50:19.820
Do you know why Bluetooth
is called Bluetooth?

50:21.140 --> 50:23.659
No, but I suspect
that I'm about to find out.

50:23.660 --> 50:27.659
It's named in honour
of King Harald Bluetooth.

50:27.660 --> 50:30.579
Now, Harald was
a 10th-century Viking king,

50:30.580 --> 50:33.019
famous first of all for having
blue teeth because he ate

50:33.020 --> 50:36.499
so many blueberries, but also
for uniting the nations of Norway

50:36.500 --> 50:40.499
and Denmark - the way that
Bluetooth unites different

50:40.500 --> 50:44.059
wireless technologies into one
universal standard.

50:44.060 --> 50:45.819
No way.

50:45.820 --> 50:47.379
How good is that?!

50:47.380 --> 50:48.779
Awesome.

50:48.780 --> 50:50.059
In my defence,

50:50.060 --> 50:52.940
we did have a lot of ground to cover
to reach the Trollstigen.

50:54.180 --> 50:56.619
But if Matt didn't want to learn -
fine.

50:56.620 --> 51:01.540
On a long drive, there's plenty more
to keep you occupied in the Porsche.

51:03.220 --> 51:08.220
Massage seats.
I'm going to go shiatsu. Yeah!

51:17.060 --> 51:19.939
Wow, this sort of
touch panel thing here,

51:19.940 --> 51:22.340
this is really cool,
the touch panel thing.

51:25.500 --> 51:27.340
I like the steering wheel, though.

51:29.020 --> 51:30.940
I like these, these are nice.

51:36.140 --> 51:38.660
Yes, baby!

51:41.620 --> 51:44.099
Hey, Chris, you know
what I don't get about my car?

51:44.100 --> 51:45.899
It used to be called the FF,

51:45.900 --> 51:49.899
but now Ferrari have renamed it
the GTC4Lusso.

51:49.900 --> 51:52.939
What was wrong with
good, simple Ferrari FF?

51:52.940 --> 51:55.699
- Well, what did it actually mean?
- Ferrari Four.

51:55.700 --> 51:57.419
Four seats, four-wheel-drive.

51:57.420 --> 52:00.419
So it was the Ferrari Ferrari Four?

52:00.420 --> 52:02.579
No, no, the Ferrari Four.

52:02.580 --> 52:04.699
But that would just be
the Ferrari F.

52:04.700 --> 52:06.659
No, the second F is for four.

52:06.660 --> 52:08.660
The Ferrari F-Four?!

52:11.300 --> 52:14.659
But before we could conclude
this important debate,

52:14.660 --> 52:18.899
we had arrived at Norway's
greatest driving road.

52:18.900 --> 52:21.699
My God, look at that!

52:21.700 --> 52:23.660
Yeah. Wow!

52:26.300 --> 52:28.299
The Trollstigen.

52:28.300 --> 52:32.179
Climbing 850m
up a wall of solid rock,

52:32.180 --> 52:35.579
this narrow
switchback ribbon of tarmac

52:35.580 --> 52:40.059
is as challenging
as it is spectacular.

52:40.060 --> 52:42.139
Before we could attack it, though,

52:42.140 --> 52:44.260
we were greeted by an old friend.

52:53.620 --> 52:54.900
Boy.

52:58.140 --> 53:00.059
- Look who's back. - Yeah.

53:00.060 --> 53:02.379
Why isn't he wearing
one of those helmets with horns?

53:02.380 --> 53:03.739
No, Matt, actually,

53:03.740 --> 53:07.739
the idea that Vikings all wore
horned helmets is total nonsense.

53:07.740 --> 53:09.820
There's no evidence for it
whatsoever.

53:11.500 --> 53:14.580
- Well, we should probably...
- Yeah. - Yeah.

53:15.660 --> 53:18.939
"Welcome to the Trollstigen."
Thank you.

53:18.940 --> 53:22.379
"You will now demonstrate
your estate's people-carrying

53:22.380 --> 53:26.019
"credentials by giving some
typical Norwegians a lift.

53:26.020 --> 53:28.979
"To win, load your passengers
on board

53:28.980 --> 53:31.859
"and reach the top of the valley
in the fastest time.

53:31.860 --> 53:34.620
- "A special prize awaits." -!

53:39.500 --> 53:42.019
Tre, to, en... Go!

53:42.020 --> 53:44.299
Come on! Get a move on!

53:44.300 --> 53:46.499
In a winner-takes-all
final challenge,

53:46.500 --> 53:49.059
we would have to get a car
full of BASE jumpers

53:49.060 --> 53:50.979
to the top of the Trollstigen.

53:50.980 --> 53:53.859
Go!
OK, come on, get in, get in, get in!

53:53.860 --> 53:56.060
Fastest time wins.

54:00.260 --> 54:01.620
Ready?

54:07.740 --> 54:11.180
What a motor?
You like that?

54:12.660 --> 54:14.900
Come on, Porsche! We can do it.

54:18.500 --> 54:20.460
So much power!

54:22.100 --> 54:24.979
I'm sure you're all very,
very impressed by the power

54:24.980 --> 54:28.820
and the grip of
the Panamera Sport Turismo, yes?

54:36.980 --> 54:39.340
Did you see that?!
You guys are nuts!

54:40.340 --> 54:42.820
You just smash the throttle open
and it goes.

54:45.780 --> 54:48.020
Come on, LeBlanc,
put your foot down.

54:49.620 --> 54:50.980
Got to beat Joey!

54:53.300 --> 54:55.580
It's got power everywhere!

54:59.220 --> 55:01.100
Sprint to the end!

55:02.380 --> 55:04.020
And across the line...

55:05.660 --> 55:07.659
- Yes! - Yay!

55:07.660 --> 55:09.900
OK, there's the finish line, great.

55:20.180 --> 55:22.499
How great was that road?!

55:22.500 --> 55:25.619
- Very, very great. - Thanks, guys.

55:25.620 --> 55:28.539
- Nice bunch of guys? - No, they're
not normal, or they? - No, no.

55:28.540 --> 55:32.579
- They're not normal. I mean,
they're going flying in suits. - Yeah.

55:32.580 --> 55:34.539
Most people use a plane.

55:34.540 --> 55:36.619
It's our friend again.

55:36.620 --> 55:38.540
How did you get up here so quick?

55:41.340 --> 55:45.099
OK, these are the times.

55:45.100 --> 55:48.579
"Matt LeBlanc, you did it in
three minutes and 13 seconds."

55:48.580 --> 55:50.139
That's a good job.

55:50.140 --> 55:51.780
"Chris Harris, you did it in...

55:54.700 --> 55:56.499
.. "two minutes and 45 seconds."

55:56.500 --> 55:57.899
Yes, yes!

55:57.900 --> 56:02.099
"The winner may now collect their
prize from the boot of their car."

56:02.100 --> 56:05.259
- What is it, like, a Fortnum &amp; Mason
hamper? Goodies? - I don't know.

56:05.260 --> 56:06.740
A bit of booze?

56:09.180 --> 56:10.819
No.

56:10.820 --> 56:12.699
That's a wingsuit!

56:12.700 --> 56:14.940
It'll be fun,
you're going to love it.

56:17.460 --> 56:20.100
- There's two wingsuits there.
- Really? - Yeah.

56:22.220 --> 56:24.819
All right. I'll jump if you jump.

56:24.820 --> 56:26.779
- Really?! - Well, how hard can it be?

56:26.780 --> 56:29.100
I mean, it's just...
falling.

56:32.940 --> 56:34.659
If I do this,

56:34.660 --> 56:36.659
you promise you'll jump?

56:36.660 --> 56:38.220
I promise!

56:41.460 --> 56:42.780
Come on.

56:46.980 --> 56:50.539
OK. One, two...

56:50.540 --> 56:55.179
No, wait, wait, wait. Is it one,
two, three, or one, two, three, go?

56:55.180 --> 56:58.779
- One, two, three, go! It always is.
- OK, all right! - Get on with it!

56:58.780 --> 57:00.820
All right. OK.

57:02.580 --> 57:04.019
One...

57:04.020 --> 57:06.659
..two, three...

57:06.660 --> 57:07.940
..go!

57:11.660 --> 57:13.939
I can't believe he did it!

57:13.940 --> 57:15.500
Wow!

57:32.860 --> 57:35.859
Luckily, he landed in an eagle's
nest and it adopted him

57:35.860 --> 57:38.179
and fed him all summer.

57:38.180 --> 57:40.859
Can I just point out,
though, that earlier on,

57:40.860 --> 57:44.219
I presented a 15-grand Suzuki
that could do anything,

57:44.220 --> 57:48.339
and now you guys are telling people
to buy a Ferrari

57:48.340 --> 57:49.939
or a Porsche for six figures,

57:49.940 --> 57:54.619
instead of a perfectly good
Skoda Superb that does everything?

57:54.620 --> 57:59.019
Rory, Rory, this is Top Gear,
so, yeah!

57:59.020 --> 58:02.819
Yeah, we're not saying they should
buy a Ferrari or a Porsche,

58:02.820 --> 58:05.179
we're saying
they should buy the Porsche.

58:05.180 --> 58:08.499
No, no, we're not saying that. We're
saying they should buy the Ferrari.

58:08.500 --> 58:09.579
So, you went to Norway

58:09.580 --> 58:12.459
and then didn't even decide
which was the best car?

58:12.460 --> 58:14.419
- Yeah. - Yeah. - Right.

58:14.420 --> 58:15.859
We're here to help!

58:15.860 --> 58:18.219
And on that conclusive note,
we must end the show.

58:18.220 --> 58:21.860
Thank you so much for watching.
We'll see you next week. Goodnight!
