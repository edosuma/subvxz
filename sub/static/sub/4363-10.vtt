WEBVTT

00:06.637 --> 00:09.140
PRIORITY NUMBER ONE--
FINDING OUT WHAT CAUSED THIS.

00:09.140 --> 00:11.442
PRIORITY NUMBER TWO
IS FIGURING OUT

00:11.442 --> 00:15.046
WHETHER OR NOT
IT'LL HAPPEN AGAIN.
OUR EXPERIMENT KILLED
20 MILLION PEOPLE.

00:15.046 --> 00:17.318
WE HAVE TO GO PUBLIC

00:17.318 --> 00:21.592
AND TELL THE WORLD
THAT WE CAUSED THE BLACKOUT.
D. GIBBONS WAS ON THE PHONE
WITH SOMEBODY ELSE

00:21.592 --> 00:25.696
DURING THE BLACKOUT.
"HE WHO FORESEES CALAMITIES
SUFFERS THEM TWICE OVER."

00:25.696 --> 00:28.129
(whoosh, loud explosion)
D. GIBBONS ESCAPED.
HERE'S WHAT WE GOT NOW.

00:28.129 --> 00:29.760
WE GOT A CELL PHONE
AND WHITE QUEEN.

00:29.760 --> 00:32.063
(Demetri) I LOVE YOU, ZOEY,
EVEN IF MY PARENTS DON'T.

00:32.063 --> 00:35.166
I DIDN'T HAVE A FLASH-FORWARD
BECAUSE I'M GONNA BE DEAD.
I KNOW WHAT I SAW.

00:35.166 --> 00:37.808
THE BEACH, OUR WEDDING.
I KNOW YOU WERE THERE.

00:37.808 --> 00:40.471
YOU SAID YOU DIDN'T WANT
TO GIVE UP HOPE. THEN DON'T.

00:40.471 --> 00:43.114
OUR WIRETAPPING PROGRAM
INTERCEPTED A PHONE CALL

00:43.114 --> 00:45.376
TO A BUREAU CELL PHONE.

00:45.376 --> 00:48.719
ON MARCH 15th, 2010,
YOU ARE GOING TO BE MURDERED.

00:48.719 --> 00:53.053
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO HONG KONG.
END OF STORY.
WE'RE GOIN'.

00:53.053 --> 00:55.286
WEDECK'S GONNA BE PISSED.
HE'LL GET OVER IT.

00:55.286 --> 00:57.728
I'M HERE TO WARN YOU TONIGHT

00:57.728 --> 00:59.790
THAT THERE IS YET
A CHANCE AND A HOPE

00:59.790 --> 01:02.062
OF YOU ESCAPING
FROM MY FATE--

01:02.062 --> 01:04.835
A CHANCE AND HOPE
OF MY PROCURING, EBENEZER,

01:04.835 --> 01:07.338
YOUR FREEDOM
IN THE AFTERLIFE.

01:07.338 --> 01:11.542
TONIGHT, YOU WILL BE HAUNTED
BY THREE SPIRITS.

01:11.542 --> 01:15.506
OH. IS THAT THE CHANCE AND HOPE
YOU MENTIONED?

01:15.506 --> 01:16.807
IT IS.

01:16.807 --> 01:18.679
WITHOUT THEIR VISITS,

01:18.679 --> 01:23.214
YOU CANNOT HOPE TO SHUN
THE PATH I TREAD.

01:23.214 --> 01:26.557
EXPECT THE FIRST TOMORROW

01:26.557 --> 01:28.559
WHEN THE BELL TOLLS 1:00.

01:28.559 --> 01:31.322
(bell tolls once)

01:31.322 --> 01:33.664
EXPECT THE SECOND
ON THE NEXT NIGHT...
(chains rattle)

01:33.664 --> 01:35.866
(bell tolls twice)

01:35.866 --> 01:37.528
AT THE SAME HOUR.

01:37.528 --> 01:39.830
EXPECT THE THIRD
ON THE NEXT NIGHT

01:39.830 --> 01:42.533
WHEN THE LAST STROKE
OF 12:00...

01:42.533 --> 01:45.476
(bell tolls)
CEASES TO VIBRATE.

01:50.381 --> 01:55.146
(cell phone ringing)
DO YOU REALLY THINK WE CAN FIND
THE WOMAN WHO CALLED ME?

01:55.146 --> 01:57.288
LINGUISTICS PEGGED YOUR CALLER
AS IRANIAN,

01:57.288 --> 02:00.151
SPECIFICALLY FROM TEHRAN.
LONDON-EDUCATED.
(flips cell phone shut)

02:00.151 --> 02:01.822
HOW MANY WESTERN
PERSIAN-SPEAKING WOMAN

02:01.822 --> 02:05.326
WITH THAT KIND OF ACCENT
COULD THERE BE IN HONG KONG?

02:05.326 --> 02:09.160
WE'RE GONNA FIND HER, DEM. WE'RE
GOING ALL THE WAY. COME ON.

02:09.160 --> 02:10.531
(cell phone rings)

02:10.531 --> 02:12.363
(ring)

02:12.363 --> 02:15.366
(man) YOU REALLY SHOULD
ANSWER YOUR CELL.

02:15.366 --> 02:19.270
IT'S YOUR BOSS CALLING.

02:19.270 --> 02:22.843
MARSHALL VOGEL,
FBI LEGATS OFFICE, HONG KONG.

02:22.843 --> 02:25.646
DID YOU REALLY THINK YOU WERE
JUST GONNA STROLL INTO TOWN

02:25.646 --> 02:27.448
WITHOUT IMMIGRATION
FLAGGING YOUR ARRIVAL?

02:27.448 --> 02:28.819
MARK BENFORD. THIS IS--

02:28.819 --> 02:31.151
AGENT DEMETRI FORDIS NOH.

02:31.151 --> 02:33.654
BADGE NUMBER 4587.

02:33.654 --> 02:36.327
BORN FEBRUARY 17th, 1977.

02:36.327 --> 02:37.758
POTENTIALLY MURDERED

02:37.758 --> 02:39.690
MARCH 15th, 2010.

02:39.690 --> 02:41.832
GENTLEMEN, I KNOW ALL ABOUT
AGENT NOH'S MYSTERY WOMAN

02:41.832 --> 02:44.635
AND I KNOW WHY
YOU'RE LOOKING FOR HER.

02:44.635 --> 02:46.637
BUT THIS IS
A SOVEREIGN TERRITORY

02:46.637 --> 02:48.299
OF COMMUNIST CHINA,

02:48.299 --> 02:51.872
A COUNTRY THAT OURS BELIEVES WAS
RESPONSIBLE FOR THE BLACKOUT.

02:51.872 --> 02:54.875
SO YOU'RE HERE TO OFFER
YOUR HELP IS WHAT YOU'RE SAYING.

02:54.875 --> 02:56.877
"GO HOME"
IS WHAT I'M SAYING.

02:56.877 --> 02:59.410
IF YOU CATCH
THE FIRST FLIGHT BACK,

02:59.410 --> 03:03.884
YOUR JOBS MIGHT ACTUALLY
STILL BE THERE WAITING FOR YOU.
UNLESS YOU'RE WILLING
TO ARREST US,

03:03.884 --> 03:06.587
I THINK WE'LL TAKE OUR CHANCES.
(cell phone rings)

03:06.587 --> 03:08.759
(ring)

03:08.759 --> 03:10.561
HEY, CUPCAKE.

03:10.561 --> 03:14.225
(Wedeck) What part of
"stay the hell out of Hong Kong"

03:14.225 --> 03:16.367
DID YOU TWO IDIOTS
NOT UNDERSTAND?!

03:16.367 --> 03:18.369
STAN, AL GOUGH DID
A HALF GAINER

03:18.369 --> 03:20.371
OFF THE BUILDING
YOU'RE CURRENTLY STANDING IN

03:20.371 --> 03:22.733
TO PROVE TO US
THE FUTURE CAN BE CHANGED.

03:22.733 --> 03:24.905
YOU TWO ARE DISOBEYING
A DIRECT ORDER!

03:24.905 --> 03:26.937
BY THE WAY,
I LIED TO DEMETRI.

03:26.937 --> 03:29.840
I TOLD HIM YOU CHANGED YOUR MIND
ABOUT US COMING OUT HERE.

03:29.840 --> 03:31.542
MERRY CHRISTMAS.
(beep)

03:31.542 --> 03:34.515
(grunts)

03:36.247 --> 03:38.919
WHY'D YOU TELL HIM
YOU LIED TO ME?

03:38.919 --> 03:41.392
BECAUSE IF THINGS GO SOUTH,

03:41.392 --> 03:44.255
YOU'RE DEFINITELY GONNA NEED
TO KEEP CARRYING A GUN.

03:44.255 --> 03:46.797
(man) THAT'S RIGHT, TERRY,
WE'RE LIVE HERE IN PALO ALTO

03:46.797 --> 03:48.459
WHERE SOURCES ARE CLAIMING

03:48.459 --> 03:50.761
A MAJOR ANNOUNCEMENT
WILL BE MADE

03:50.761 --> 03:52.763
CONCERNING THE CAUSES
OF THE GLOBAL BLACKOUT.

03:52.763 --> 03:54.865
THANK YOU FOR ATTENDING
THIS PRESS CONFERENCE.

03:54.865 --> 03:56.537
MY NAME IS GORDON MYHILL.

03:56.537 --> 03:58.509
I AM THE DIRECTOR

03:58.509 --> 04:00.471
OF THE NATIONAL
LINEAR ACCELERATOR PROJECT.

04:00.471 --> 04:02.773
TODAY WE HAVE
SOME IMPORTANT INFORMATION

04:02.773 --> 04:04.845
CONCERNING THE EVENTS
OF OCTOBER 6th

04:04.845 --> 04:06.917
THAT WE FEEL NEEDS TO BE SHARED
WITH THE GLOBAL COMMUNITY.

04:06.917 --> 04:10.951
YOU KNOW THEY'RE GONNA
CRUCIFY US.
WHAT'S A LITTLE MARTYRDOM
BETWEEN FRIENDS?

04:10.951 --> 04:12.953
JUST MAKE SURE YOU STICK
TO THE TALKING POINTS

04:12.953 --> 04:15.486
WE DISCUSSED WITH MYHILL.
THE LAST THING WE NEED

04:15.486 --> 04:17.658
IS YOUR GUILTY CONSCIENCE
DRAGGING US DOWN ANY FURTHER.

04:17.658 --> 04:20.861
WHAT THE HELL DOES THAT MEAN?
YOU FEEL GUILTY BECAUSE
YOUR WIFE DIED IN THE BLACKOUT.

04:20.861 --> 04:22.893
I GET IT. NOW YOU HAVE TO TAKE
CARE OF YOUR SON. BOO HOO.

04:22.893 --> 04:25.896
I'M NOT GONNA LET YOU DRAG ME
DOWN INTO YOUR SPIRAL OF SHAME

04:25.896 --> 04:29.600
JUST BECAUSE YOU'RE PLAYING
MR. MOM. UNDERSTOOD?
I'D LIKE TO INTRODUCE YOU

04:29.600 --> 04:33.844
TO OUR ASSOCIATE DIRECTORS OF
THE PLASMA-WAKEFIELD PROGRAM--

04:33.844 --> 04:37.678
DR. LLOYD SIMCOE
AND DR. SIMON CAMPOS.

04:37.678 --> 04:43.053
UH, GOOD--GOOD MORNING.
MY NAME IS LLOYD SIMCOE.

04:43.053 --> 04:45.055
AS DR. MYHILL INDICATED,

04:45.055 --> 04:49.289
OUR SPECIALITY IS PROTON-DRIVEN
PLASMA WAKEFIELD ACCELERATION.

04:49.289 --> 04:51.291
WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO
AT THIS FACILITY

04:51.291 --> 04:53.424
IS TO REPRODUCE THE KIND
OF ENERGY LEVELS THAT EXISTED

04:53.424 --> 04:55.426
JUST AFTER THE BIG BANG,

04:55.426 --> 04:57.928
BUT ON A MUCH MORE
CONTROLLABLE SCALE.

04:57.928 --> 05:01.572
WE WERE CONDUCTING JUST SUCH
AN EXPERIMENT HERE ON...

05:01.572 --> 05:03.033
OCTOBER THE 6th,

05:03.033 --> 05:06.377
AT PRECISELY 1100 HOURS
PACIFIC DAYLIGHT TIME.

05:06.377 --> 05:07.978
(audience shouting a same time)

05:07.978 --> 05:09.910
NO, NO, PLEASE. PLEASE--PLEASE.

05:09.910 --> 05:11.982
COULD YOU JUST WAIT
FOR A MOMENT, PLEASE?
(shouting stops)

05:11.982 --> 05:13.944
I-I WILL TAKE QUESTIONS
IN A MINUTE.

05:13.944 --> 05:18.018
PLEASE, I-I JUST NEED TO GET
TO THE HEART OF THE MATTER.

05:18.018 --> 05:20.020
UH, WE ARE HERE TODAY

05:20.020 --> 05:23.894
BECAUSE WE BELIEVE
THAT THE GLOBAL BLACKOUT

05:23.894 --> 05:26.697
WAS PRECIPITATED
BY OUR EXPERIMENT.

05:26.697 --> 05:29.530
(man) HOW CAN THAT BE?
NO, NO, PLEASE. PLEASE.

05:29.530 --> 05:32.062
(man) ARE YOU SURE?
IF YOU JUST GIVE ME A MOMENT,

05:32.062 --> 05:35.866
I-I WILL TAKE QUESTIONS
IN A MINUTE. PLEASE. ONE--
(man) WHY DIDN'T YOU
COME FORWARD BEFORE THIS?!

05:35.866 --> 05:40.911
(all shouting at once)

05:40.911 --> 05:43.574
SO ARE YOU
TAKING RESPONSIBILITY

05:43.574 --> 05:46.447
FOR ALL THE DEATHS AND DAMAGE
CAUSED BY THE BLACKOUT?

05:46.447 --> 05:50.020
(camera shutters clicking)

05:50.020 --> 05:52.883
UH, WE ADMIT
THAT OUR EXPERIMENT

05:52.883 --> 05:55.355
DOES SEEM
THE MOST LIKELY CAUSE, YES.

05:55.355 --> 05:57.388
BUT WE CONTEND THAT
THERE WAS NO WAY TO PREDICT

05:57.388 --> 06:00.431
ANYTHING LIKE THIS
HAPPENING WHATSOEVER.

06:00.431 --> 06:02.433
THIS WAS
UTTERLY UNFORESEEABLE.

06:02.433 --> 06:04.995
SCIENTISTS CONDUCT EXPERIMENTS
ALL THE TIME.

06:04.995 --> 06:07.498
WE CANNOT STOP
CONDUCTING EXPERIMENTS

06:07.498 --> 06:09.940
BECAUSE WE ARE NOT 100% SURE
OF THE RESULTS.

06:09.940 --> 06:12.473
IF THIS GUY CAUSED THE BLACKOUT,
WHAT'S THAT MEAN FOR MOSAIC?

06:12.473 --> 06:14.745
THIS GAME OVER?

06:14.745 --> 06:18.809
MAYBE SIMCOE CAUSED
THE BLACKOUT. MAYBE HE DIDN'T.

06:18.809 --> 06:21.952
GAME'S NOT OVER.

06:21.952 --> 06:23.584
ALL THE WORK THAT WE'VE--

06:23.584 --> 06:25.586
N.L.A.P. WILL BE RELEASING
AN OFFICIAL STATEMENT

06:25.586 --> 06:27.958
REGARDING THIS EVENT
INCLUDING...

06:27.958 --> 06:31.021
(all shouting indistinctly)
WE'LL NOW BE CONCLUDING...

06:31.021 --> 06:32.092
(speaks indistinctly)

06:32.092 --> 06:34.925
LOOK, PLEASE,
BELIEVE ME WHEN I SAY

06:34.925 --> 06:36.967
THAT OUR HEARTS GO OUT
TO ANYONE WHO WAS HURT

06:36.967 --> 06:39.099
OR WHO LOST SOMEONE
THAT THEY CARED FOR.

06:39.099 --> 06:40.931
MY OWN WIFE WAS KILLED,

06:40.931 --> 06:44.605
AND I WOULD GIVE ANYTHING
TO HAVE HER BACK.

06:44.605 --> 06:46.607
LOOK, WE UNDERSTAND
PEOPLE ARE SCARED

06:46.607 --> 06:48.939
BECAUSE THEY THINK THERE'S
GOING TO BE ANOTHER BLACKOUT,

06:48.939 --> 06:52.513
BUT THERE WON'T BE
BECAUSE WE WERE THE CAUSE,

06:52.513 --> 06:54.485
AND WE ASSURE YOU...

06:54.485 --> 06:58.018
WE ASSURE YOU THAT THIS
COULD NOT HAPPEN AGAIN.

06:58.018 --> 07:00.921
BECAUSE AS OF THIS MOMENT,
ALL PLASMA WAKEFIELD EXPERIMENTS

07:00.921 --> 07:03.053
ARE BEING PUT ON HOLD
INDEFINITELY.

07:03.053 --> 07:07.127
(shouting continues)

07:09.059 --> 07:10.901
(screaming)

07:10.901 --> 07:14.735
(gunshot)
YOU THINK
YOU CAN JUST APOLOGIZE?!

07:14.735 --> 07:16.737
(man shouts indistinctly)

07:16.737 --> 07:19.840
YOU KILLED MY FAMILY! (crying)

07:19.840 --> 07:22.473
IDIOT. HEY, WE TALKED ABOUT
"HAVING SUSPICIONS"

07:22.473 --> 07:24.475
ABOUT OUR WORK "CONTRIBUTING
TO A PHENOMENA."

07:24.475 --> 07:26.477
WE NEEDED TO BE
MORE DEFINITIVE.

07:26.477 --> 07:28.549
THERE IS NO "WE."
YOU MADE THAT CLEAR.

07:28.549 --> 07:31.482
YOU LOST ALL OBJECTIVITY,
LLOYD.
YEAH, AND YOU'RE WILLINGLY
IGNORING THE OBVIOUS

07:31.482 --> 07:33.484
JUST TO SAVE YOUR OWN SKIN.
YEAH, OF COURSE I AM.

07:33.484 --> 07:35.486
IT'S CALLED
THE SCIENTIFIC METHOD.

07:35.486 --> 07:37.488
IT'S ABOUT COLLECTING
EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE.

07:37.488 --> 07:39.490
AND UNTIL WE CAN PROVE
EMPIRICALLY

07:39.490 --> 07:41.492
THAT WE WERE
THE CAUSE OF THIS,

07:41.492 --> 07:43.494
I'M NOT ABOUT TO FLUSH MY LIFE
DOWN THE TOILET.

07:43.494 --> 07:45.496
I DO NOT THINK WE WERE TO BLAME
FOR THIS. YOU DO.

07:45.496 --> 07:47.498
AND IF YOU WILL NOT SEE
MY LINE OF REASONING,

07:47.498 --> 07:50.501
IT'S ALL-OUT WAR BETWEEN US.
(shouting continues in distance)

08:07.918 --> 08:09.920
WHOA.
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOUR TV?

08:09.920 --> 08:11.922
THOSE SCIENTISTS--I WANT THEM
IN HERE YESTERDAY.

08:11.922 --> 08:14.925
I WANT TO DEBRIEF THEM.
YOU AND 7 BILLION OTHER PEOPLE.

08:14.925 --> 08:16.927
BOTH DISAPPEARED
FROM N.L.A.P.

08:16.927 --> 08:18.929
WITHIN TEN MINUTES
OF THEIR ANNOUNCEMENT.

08:18.929 --> 08:21.171
SIMON CAMPOS IS
COMPLETELY OFF OUR RADAR.

08:21.171 --> 08:23.874
LLOYD SIMCOE--HE HAD A TICKET
FOR A FLIGHT TO D.C.

08:23.874 --> 08:26.506
THAT LEFT SAN FRANCISCO WITHIN
AN HOUR OF HIS LITTLE SPEECH.

08:26.506 --> 08:28.909
WE JUST FOUND OUT
HE WASN'T ON THE PLANE.

08:28.909 --> 08:30.741
WAIT... SIMCOE.

08:30.741 --> 08:33.143
OH, I KNEW
I HEARD THAT NAME BEFORE.

08:33.143 --> 08:35.115
HOW AND WHY, JANIS?

08:35.115 --> 08:36.947
WHEN I WAS IN THE HOSPITAL,

08:36.947 --> 08:38.989
I OVERHEARD OLIVIA BENFORD
TALKING ABOUT DYLAN SIMCOE.
(beep)

08:38.989 --> 08:40.991
HE WAS A PATIENT
THAT THEY WERE TREATING,

08:40.991 --> 08:43.093
AND ACCORDING TO THIS
HE'S LLOYD SIMCOE'S SON.

08:43.093 --> 08:45.295
THEN YOU'RE GOING
TO ANGELES HOSPITAL

08:45.295 --> 08:49.960
TO WAIT FOR HIM
TO CHECK ON HIS BOY.
WE DON'T HAVE ANY BASIS
FOR AN ARREST THOUGH, RIGHT?

08:49.960 --> 08:52.062
RIGHT. THIS IS YOU--ONE AGENT
REACHING OUT. THAT'S IT.

08:52.062 --> 08:54.134
WE NEED TO KNOW
WHAT HE KNOWS.

08:54.134 --> 08:55.906
OKAY.

08:57.908 --> 09:00.310
OH, HEY, HAVE YOU SPOKEN
TO MARK OR DEMETRI?

09:00.310 --> 09:01.972
YEAH.

09:01.972 --> 09:03.974
THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED
TO THE TV.

09:12.983 --> 09:15.986
(beep)
(woman) You've reached
the Nohs. Leave a message.

09:15.986 --> 09:18.188
(beep)
MRS. NOH, LOOK, THIS IS IT.

09:18.188 --> 09:22.092
UM, THIS WILL BE THE LAST TIME
I ASK YOU.

09:22.092 --> 09:24.965
YOU'RE THE PARENTS
OF THE MAN THAT I LOVE.

09:24.965 --> 09:26.967
I WANT YOU AT OUR WEDDING.

09:26.967 --> 09:30.200
(whoosh)
IN THE FUTURE THAT I SAW,
YOU WERE THERE.

09:30.200 --> 09:32.973
AND IF YOU SAY YOU'LL GO,
IT MAKES IT REAL.

09:32.973 --> 09:36.747
I'M SUPPOSED TO MARRY DEMETRI,

09:36.747 --> 09:38.749
AND I HOPE TO GOD
THAT THIS IS THE MESSAGE

09:38.749 --> 09:41.051
I'M SUPPOSED TO SEND
SO THAT YOU GO.

09:41.051 --> 09:43.914
I LOVE YOUR SON MORE THAN
ANYTHING IN THIS WORLD,

09:43.914 --> 09:46.717
AND... MA'AM, HE LOVES ME.

09:46.717 --> 09:48.989
CAN YOU JUST PLEASE HELP US
BE TOGETHER?

09:48.989 --> 09:51.822
(flips cell phone shut)

09:51.822 --> 09:54.164
GOOD MORNING, ZOEY.
YOU'RE EARLY.
HEY! HEY, WELL, YOU KNOW,

09:54.164 --> 09:56.196
I'M TRYING TO MAKE
SENIOR PARTNER ONE DAY, TOO.

09:56.196 --> 09:58.669
SO...
ARE YOU GOING
TO THE MEMORIAL TONIGHT?

09:58.669 --> 10:00.671
I KNOW YOU DIDN'T
KNOW JOYCE WELL.

10:00.671 --> 10:03.674
SHE WAS SO FRIENDLY AND, UH,
SO KIND TO ME, SO, OF COURSE.

10:03.674 --> 10:06.036
I-I WOULDN'T MISS IT.
I'LL SEE YOU THEN.

10:06.036 --> 10:07.708
YES.

10:07.708 --> 10:10.711
(indistinct conversations)

10:12.182 --> 10:15.345
(Demetri) OKAY,
THIS IS ACCORDING

10:15.345 --> 10:17.617
TO THE COORDINATES
AUDIO FORENSICS SENT ME,

10:17.617 --> 10:21.822
WE'RE WITHIN 300 FEET OF WHERE
EARTHA PLACED HER CALL TO ME.

10:21.822 --> 10:23.223
EARTHA?

10:23.223 --> 10:26.957
WELL, SHE KIND OF SOUNDS LIKE
EARTHA KITT, DON'T YOU THINK?

10:26.957 --> 10:31.361
YOU KNOW, THE "BATMAN" TV SHOW.
SHE PLAYED CATWOMAN.
(laughs)

10:31.361 --> 10:34.064
YOU'RE RIGHT. SHE DOES SOUND
LIKE EARTHA KITT.

10:34.064 --> 10:37.868
YEAH, A PERSIAN,
WELL-EDUCATED EARTHA KITT.

10:37.868 --> 10:39.870
LISTEN, THERE'S ONLY
TWO NEWSSTANDS

10:39.870 --> 10:41.912
WITHIN A BLOCK OF HERE
THAT SELL PERSIAN NEWSPAPERS.

10:41.912 --> 10:43.373
AND THIS MAY BE A STRETCH,

10:43.373 --> 10:45.375
BUT THERE'S A PLACE
AROUND THE CORNER

10:45.375 --> 10:47.377
THAT SELLS IRANIAN CIGARETTES.
THAT VOICE...

10:47.377 --> 10:50.981
YOU KNOW, IT'S A--IT'S A PRETTY
GOOD BET SHE SMOKES.

10:50.981 --> 10:52.282
WHAT?

10:53.954 --> 10:55.826
MADD O--MADD O MEH?

10:55.826 --> 10:59.059
MM-HMM. FARSI FOR
"THE TIDE AND THE MIST."

10:59.059 --> 11:02.092
PERSIAN WOMAN. PERSIAN FOOD.

11:02.092 --> 11:04.294
YAHTZEE.

11:11.671 --> 11:13.003
TOMORROW?
TOMORROW.

11:13.003 --> 11:15.746
(man) â™ª O, CHRISTMAS TREE â™ª

11:15.746 --> 11:17.077
â™ª O, CHRISTMAS TREE â™ª
(typing)

11:17.077 --> 11:20.450
â™ª YOU STAND IN VERDANT BEAUTY â™ª

11:20.450 --> 11:22.913
AH, FORGET IT.

11:22.913 --> 11:24.154
(types)

11:24.154 --> 11:26.957
â™ª O, CHRISTMAS TREE â™ª

11:26.957 --> 11:30.791
â™ª YOU STAND IN VERDANT BEAUTY â™ª

11:30.791 --> 11:32.763
WHAT?

11:32.763 --> 11:34.965
I'VE JUST NEVER
BEEN SURVEILLED BEFORE.

11:34.965 --> 11:36.727
I'M NOT SURVEILLING YOU.

11:36.727 --> 11:38.769
IT FEELS LIKE
I'M BEING SURVEILLED.

11:38.769 --> 11:40.230
WELL, I COULD SPLIT

11:40.230 --> 11:43.233
IF YOU JUST SLIDE ME
LLOYD SIMCOE'S PHONE NUMBER.

11:43.233 --> 11:46.136
OKAY. AND WHAT DO I DO
AFTER I GET FIRED?

11:46.136 --> 11:48.138
WELL, A GIRL'S GOTTA TRY.

11:48.138 --> 11:51.211
DR. BENFORD SAID THAT
YOU CAME IN WHILE I WAS AWAY.

11:51.211 --> 11:53.984
HOW'D IT GO?
SHE SAYS I'M DOING GOOD...

11:53.984 --> 11:57.087
NOT GOOD ENOUGH
TO HAVE A BABY YET.

11:57.087 --> 11:59.820
YOU WANNA HAVE A BABY?

11:59.820 --> 12:01.892
WELL, I DIDN'T,
BUT THEN THE BLACKOUT HAPPENED,

12:01.892 --> 12:04.825
AND I SAW MYSELF
GETTING A SONOGRAM.

12:04.825 --> 12:06.827
I WAS PREGNANT,
AND IT WAS TOTALLY CRAZY.

12:06.827 --> 12:10.901
IT WAS LIKE BEING IN LOVE
OR SOMETHING.

12:10.901 --> 12:13.864
I DON'T KNOW. MAYBE I'LL JUST
LISTEN TO THE UNIVERSE

12:13.864 --> 12:17.107
AND THROW THE TOWEL IN
ON THE WHOLE THING.

12:17.107 --> 12:19.469
LISTEN...

12:19.469 --> 12:22.873
IN YOUR FLASH-FORWARD,
YOU SAW YOURSELF PREGNANT.

12:22.873 --> 12:24.875
SO IF YOU WERE REALLY LISTENING
TO THE UNIVERSE,

12:24.875 --> 12:27.447
YOU'D BE TRYING
TO HAVE THAT BABY.

12:27.447 --> 12:29.449
DO YOU KNOW HOW FAR ALONG
YOU WERE?

12:29.449 --> 12:32.823
UH, THE SONOGRAPHER SAID
FOUR MONTHS.

12:32.823 --> 12:36.386
BEGINNING OF JANUARY.
IF THAT'S WHAT YOU SAW, THEN...

12:36.386 --> 12:39.159
THEN I'M SUPPOSED
TO GET PREGNANT.

12:39.159 --> 12:41.832
YOU STILL WANNA GET PREGNANT?
YEAH.

12:41.832 --> 12:44.764
THEN DON'T GIVE UP.

12:46.867 --> 12:50.040
HITLER, IDI AMIN,
SUHARTO--

12:50.040 --> 12:52.002
SIMCOE AND CAMPOS
KILLED MORE PEOPLE

12:52.002 --> 12:54.144
THAN ALL OF THOSE MONSTERS
COMBINED.

12:54.144 --> 12:57.147
(telephone rings)
THERE'S A REAL GOOD CASE
TO BE MADE HERE

12:57.147 --> 13:00.210
THAT THESE GUYS ARE THE WORST
MASS MURDERS IN HISTORY.
(ring)

13:00.210 --> 13:02.212
WHY AREN'T THEY IN JAIL?

13:02.212 --> 13:04.214
WEDECK.
OKAY, FIRST OFF,

13:04.214 --> 13:06.216
SIMCOE AND CAMPOS
HAVEN'T BROKEN ANY LAWS.
HE'S...

13:06.216 --> 13:08.919
HAVEN'T BROKEN ANY LAWS?! WELL,
WHAT ABOUT CRIMINAL NEGLIGENCE?

13:08.919 --> 13:10.991
AND NO ONE...
...25 MILLION PEOPLE...

13:10.991 --> 13:12.993
YEAH, BUT WE'LL HAVE
AN INVESTIGATION.
YES.

13:12.993 --> 13:15.565
THERE NEEDS TO BE
A TRIAL!

13:15.565 --> 13:17.567
(hangs up receiver)
SIMCOE WENT TO HARVARD?

13:17.567 --> 13:20.570
1998. GOT HIS PhD
IN APPLIED PHYSICS.

13:20.570 --> 13:23.133
MAYBE YOU GUYS COULD...
OH, I DON'T KNOW,

13:23.133 --> 13:27.137
STOP TRAINING TERRORISTS?

13:27.137 --> 13:29.479
LLOYD SIMCOE
AND SIMON CAMPOS...

13:29.479 --> 13:31.481
(speaks indistinctly)

13:31.481 --> 13:34.544
SO YOU'RE HERE
TO TURN YOURSELF IN?

13:34.544 --> 13:38.148
I'M NOT SURE WHAT WE DID
COULD BE CONSTRUED AS A CRIME,

13:38.148 --> 13:41.992
EVEN IF IT WERE PROVEN
WE WERE RESPONSIBLE.

13:41.992 --> 13:45.325
(men speaking indistinctly)

13:53.463 --> 13:57.137
I DO NOT BELIEVE
WE CAUSED THE BLACKOUT.
WELL, YOU PROBABLY
SHOULDN'T HAVE

13:57.137 --> 14:00.911
STOOD UP IN FRONT OF A CROWD
OF REPORTERS AND SAID YOU DID.
NOT MY CHOICE.

14:00.911 --> 14:04.144
LLOYD SIMCOE TENDS TO LET
HIS EMOTIONS RUN RAMPANT.

14:04.144 --> 14:05.845
I DON'T.

14:05.845 --> 14:08.919
ANY IDEA
WHO IS RESPONSIBLE THEN?

14:08.919 --> 14:10.380
NO.

14:10.380 --> 14:12.382
BUT I'M CERTAIN
IF YOU ALLOWED ME ACCESS

14:12.382 --> 14:14.885
TO YOUR MOSAIC INVESTIGATION I
COULD DIVINE THE ANSWER FOR YOU.

14:14.885 --> 14:17.527
SO YOU WANT TO BE DEPUTIZED?

14:17.527 --> 14:20.190
I'VE SERVED ON THREE PANELS WITH
THE NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION.

14:20.190 --> 14:22.062
I HAVE SECURITY CLEARANCE--

14:22.062 --> 14:24.364
YOU'RE CONFUSING ME
WITH SOMEONE WHO GIVES A DAMN.

14:24.364 --> 14:27.867
I'M UP FOR GIVING YOU A LISTEN,
NOT A NEW CAREER.

14:27.867 --> 14:30.870
HOW LONG DO YOU THINK
WASHINGTON WILL CONTINUE TO FUND

14:30.870 --> 14:33.443
AN INVESTIGATION
INTO WHAT CAUSED THE BLACKOUT

14:33.443 --> 14:35.445
WHEN SOMEBODY HAS ALREADY
STEPPED FORWARD

14:35.445 --> 14:37.147
AND ACCEPTED THE BLAME?

14:37.147 --> 14:40.911
MY GUESS IS, UNLESS YOU COME UP
WITH SOME COMPELLING EVIDENCE

14:40.911 --> 14:44.084
RELATIVELY SOON, YOU'LL NEVER
FIND OUT WHAT OR WHO CAUSED

14:44.084 --> 14:47.157
THE GREATEST GLOBAL CATASTROPHE
IN HUMAN HISTORY

14:47.157 --> 14:51.161
OR IF YOU CAN PREVENT IT
FROM HAPPENING AGAIN.

14:51.161 --> 14:53.063
HOW ABOUT THIS--

14:53.063 --> 14:56.066
YOU COME BACK TOMORROW MORNING.
I'LL HAVE SOMETHING TO SHOW YOU.

14:56.066 --> 14:57.897
WE MAKE SOME PROGRESS...

14:57.897 --> 15:01.431
I'LL SEE WHAT I CAN DO
ABOUT AN OFFICIAL ROLE.

15:01.431 --> 15:04.004
BECAUSE I DO LIKE YOU,

15:04.004 --> 15:07.137
ASSISTANT DIRECTOR WEDECK...

15:09.239 --> 15:12.012
I WILL ACCEPT
YOUR DISINGENUOUS OFFER.

15:12.012 --> 15:16.046
(man)
â™ª DASHING THROUGH THE SNOW â™ª

15:16.046 --> 15:19.189
â™ª IN A ONE-HORSE OPEN SLEIGH â™ª

15:19.189 --> 15:22.122
â™ª O'ER THE FIELDS WE GO â™ª

15:22.122 --> 15:23.923
â™ª WE'RE LAUGHING ALL THE WAY â™ª

15:23.923 --> 15:25.925
DID YOU CHARTER A FLIGHT?

15:25.925 --> 15:27.357
EXCUSE ME?

15:27.357 --> 15:29.699
I'M AGENT JANIS HAWK
WITH THE MOSAIC TASK FORCE.

15:29.699 --> 15:32.702
ARE YOU HERE TO ARREST ME?
BECAUSE--
COME IN AND TALK TO US.

15:32.702 --> 15:36.506
WE NEED INFORMATION,
AND YOU NEED SOME PROTECTION.

15:36.506 --> 15:39.009
LOOK, I'M SORRY. MY SON'S SAFETY
IS MY PRIORITY RIGHT NOW.

15:39.009 --> 15:40.971
AND IF YOU'VE CONNECTED ME
TO HIM,

15:40.971 --> 15:42.973
THEN IT WON'T BE LONG
BEFORE OTHERS DO AS WELL,

15:42.973 --> 15:45.976
SO I HAVE TO GET HIM
OUT OF HERE IMMEDIATELY.
LET US HELP YOU, PLEASE.

15:45.976 --> 15:49.479
THIS COULD BE AN OPPORTUNITY
FOR BOTH OF US.
I'VE TRIED TO BE POLITE
ABOUT THIS,

15:49.479 --> 15:52.022
BUT I'M NOT INTERESTED, OKAY?
JUST LEAVE US ALONE.

15:52.022 --> 15:53.984
â™ª JINGLE ALL THE WAY â™ª

15:56.156 --> 15:58.228
WE'RE LOOKING FOR A FRIEND.

15:58.228 --> 16:01.491
SHE WORKS AROUND HERE,
MAYBE EATS AT THIS RESTAURANT.

16:01.491 --> 16:03.663
WE DON'T HAVE A PICTURE OF HER,

16:03.663 --> 16:05.996
BUT WE DO HAVE
A RECORDING OF HER VOICE.

16:05.996 --> 16:08.338
I'M WONDERING
IF YOU MIGHT TAKE A LISTEN

16:08.338 --> 16:11.101
AND LET US KNOW
IF YOU RECOGNIZE IT.
SURE.

16:11.101 --> 16:14.474
(beep)
I am sorry. There is
no delicate way to say this,

16:14.474 --> 16:18.708
but... on March 15th, 2010,

16:18.708 --> 16:22.112
you are going to be murdered.

16:23.183 --> 16:25.485
I'M SORRY.

16:25.485 --> 16:30.420
I WOULD REMEMBER THAT VOICE
IF I KNEW WHO IT BELONGED TO.

16:30.420 --> 16:32.422
NOW... HOW ABOUT SOME DESSERT?

16:32.422 --> 16:35.125
SURE. THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT.
OKAY.

16:37.267 --> 16:38.998
YEAH, I SAW IT.

16:38.998 --> 16:43.033
STAND OUTSIDE.
MAKE SURE NO ONE COMES IN.
(utensil clinks)

16:43.033 --> 16:45.035
(drops utensil)

16:47.307 --> 16:51.641
(automated male voice)
HO, HO, HO! MERRY CHRISTMAS!

16:51.641 --> 16:53.743
(indistinct conversations)

16:55.014 --> 16:57.487
OKAY, SOME FALOODEH.

16:57.487 --> 16:58.648
THANK YOU.

16:58.648 --> 17:00.450
YOUR FRIEND?

17:00.450 --> 17:03.553
(utensil clinks)
STEPPED OUTSIDE.
HEY, SIT DOWN. JOIN ME.

17:06.056 --> 17:07.357
(chair scrapes on floor)

17:07.357 --> 17:09.699
(sighs)

17:09.699 --> 17:12.162
THE, UH...

17:12.162 --> 17:15.705
WOMAN WE'RE LOOKING FOR--
SHE HAS INFORMATION WE NEED.

17:15.705 --> 17:19.109
IT'S A MATTER
OF LIFE AND DEATH.

17:19.109 --> 17:22.112
I'M SO SORRY.
I CAN'T HELP YOU WITH THAT.

17:22.112 --> 17:23.573
(utensil clinks)

17:23.573 --> 17:26.045
YOU HAVE IT BACKWARDS.

17:26.045 --> 17:28.218
IF YOU CAN'T HELP,

17:28.218 --> 17:30.220
YOU WILL BE SORRY.

17:30.220 --> 17:33.353
(cup clatters)

17:33.353 --> 17:35.425
(whispers)
YOU KNOW THAT WOMAN.

17:35.425 --> 17:38.458
(normal voice)
NOT SO LONG AGO,

17:38.458 --> 17:43.363
A HOTEL CONCIERGE
NAMED ANOUSH HARANDI,

17:43.363 --> 17:45.835
AN IRANIAN MAN
MUCH LIKE YOURSELF,

17:45.835 --> 17:48.238
WAS TAKEN
FROM HIS HOME IN BANGKOK

17:48.238 --> 17:50.240
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT

17:50.240 --> 17:52.102
BECAUSE MY GOVERNMENT BELIEVED

17:52.102 --> 17:55.405
HE HAD SOME SMALL PIECE
OF INFORMATION.

17:55.405 --> 17:58.108
HIS FRIENDS, HIS FAMILY--

17:58.108 --> 18:00.150
NO ONE KNEW
WHAT HAPPENED TO HIM.

18:00.150 --> 18:04.314
HE SPENT TWO YEARS
IN SECRET DETENTION.

18:04.314 --> 18:06.786
MY, UM, GOVERNMENT'S GOTTEN

18:06.786 --> 18:10.120
VERY GOOD
AT THAT SORT OF THING.

18:13.523 --> 18:15.565
HER NAME IS NHADRA UDAYA.

18:15.565 --> 18:17.227
YOU GOT HER NAME?

18:17.227 --> 18:19.769
SHE COMES HERE ON THE WEEKENDS,
BUT ALMOST EVERY NIGHT

18:19.769 --> 18:22.772
SHE HAS A LATE DINNER AT
A DIM SUM PLACE TWO BLOCKS DOWN.

18:22.772 --> 18:25.435
NOW WE JUST HAVE
TO GET HER TO TALK,

18:25.435 --> 18:27.106
ONE WAY OR ANOTHER.

18:27.106 --> 18:30.310
HEY, WHY DIDN'T YOU
WANT ME IN THERE?

18:30.310 --> 18:33.443
I'M TRYING
TO PROTECT YOU, DEM.

18:33.443 --> 18:36.586
IF SOMEONE'S HANDS
ARE GONNA GET DIRTY,

18:36.586 --> 18:38.848
LET 'EM BE MINE.

18:38.848 --> 18:41.120
WE'VE GIVEN THESE
TO OUR TOP LEVEL ANALYSTS.

18:41.120 --> 18:44.424
THEY HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO TELL
US ANYTHING USEFUL ABOUT THEM.

18:44.424 --> 18:46.826
WELL, IT'S A GOOD THING
I'M SMARTER THAN THEY ARE.

18:46.826 --> 18:48.898
THESE ARE
HIGHLY CLASSIFIED IMAGES,

18:48.898 --> 18:51.401
SO WE'VE OBSCURED ANYTHING

18:51.401 --> 18:53.403
THAT WOULD INDICATE
WHERE THEY WERE TAKEN.
SOMALIA.

18:53.403 --> 18:56.536
THE DIPPED SLOPES
IN THE OVERLYING LIMESTONE,

18:56.536 --> 18:59.469
THE ORIENTATION OF THE FLORA,
THE SHALLOW WATER HOLES--

18:59.469 --> 19:03.213
JUST TELL US WHAT YOU SEE.
ARE YOU TAKING THE PISS?

19:03.213 --> 19:05.815
TELL US WHAT YOU SEE.

19:05.815 --> 19:07.877
ZOOM IN, PLEASE.

19:07.877 --> 19:09.449
(whirs)

19:09.449 --> 19:10.880
(beep)
(sighs) YEP.

19:10.880 --> 19:14.854
(chuckles) I DESIGNED THAT.

19:14.854 --> 19:17.787
THAT IS
A SPECIALIZED PULSED LASER

19:17.787 --> 19:19.389
FOR A PLASMA AFTERBURNER.

19:19.389 --> 19:21.891
IT INCREASES
THE RATE OF ACCELERATION

19:21.891 --> 19:23.933
FOR TRADITIONAL
RADIO FREQUENCY MACHINES.

19:23.933 --> 19:27.937
THE CONCEPT SHOULD WIN ME
A NOBEL IN A COUPLE OF YEARS.

19:27.937 --> 19:29.599
I MUST SAY,

19:29.599 --> 19:33.172
THE MODELING SOFTWARE YOU GUYS
USE IS INCREDIBLY IMPRESSIVE.

19:33.172 --> 19:36.276
STRUCTURE ALMOST LOOKS REAL.

19:36.276 --> 19:38.448
HMM.

19:38.448 --> 19:41.511
THAT IS A REAL STRUCTURE.

19:41.511 --> 19:44.854
AND THAT IS
A REAL PHOTOGRAPH.

19:44.854 --> 19:46.516
THAT'S NOT POSSIBLE.

19:46.516 --> 19:48.518
THE TECHNOLOGY
DOESN'T EXIST YET.

19:48.518 --> 19:50.920
WE'RE STILL RUNNING
NUMERICAL SIMULATIONS.

19:50.920 --> 19:54.424
WHEN DID YOU COME UP
WITH THE IDEA FOR THE LASER?

19:54.424 --> 19:57.697
2002. WHY?

19:57.697 --> 19:59.829
WELL, THAT PHOTOGRAPH
WAS TAKEN IN 1991.

20:11.911 --> 20:14.484
THAT... DOESN'T MAKE SENSE.

20:14.484 --> 20:16.846
WHO ELSE COULD'VE
COME UP WITH THIS IDEA?

20:16.846 --> 20:19.819
NO ONE.
YOUR UNPARALLELED GENIUS ACT
IS WEARING THIN.

20:19.819 --> 20:21.851
THAT'S NOT WHAT I MEAN.

20:21.851 --> 20:25.455
LOOK, YOU ASK
ANY GREAT SCIENTIFIC MIND

20:25.455 --> 20:27.457
WHAT THEY WANT TO ACHIEVE,

20:27.457 --> 20:30.400
AND THE ONLY HONEST ANSWER
IS IMMORTALITY.

20:30.400 --> 20:32.402
IF YOU DISCOVER SOMETHING
THAT CHANGES THE WORLD,

20:32.402 --> 20:34.634
YOU LIVE FOREVER.

20:34.634 --> 20:38.468
SO WHOEVER DESIGNED THIS
NOT ONLY HAD TO BE BRILLIANT

20:38.468 --> 20:42.372
BUT DIDN'T EVEN CARE ABOUT
BEING FAMOUS. DIDN'T WANT IT.

20:42.372 --> 20:46.616
PRACTICALLY FETISHIZED
THEIR ANONYMITY.

20:46.616 --> 20:47.817
A RECLUSE.

20:47.817 --> 20:48.878
A PARANOID.

20:48.878 --> 20:51.421
EXACTLY.
WE BELIEVE THAT THIS MAN

20:51.421 --> 20:53.423
WAS SOMEHOW CONNECTED
TO THE BLACKOUT.

20:53.423 --> 20:55.885
THIS IS A COMPOSITE SKETCH
MADE BY OUR FIELD AGENTS.

20:55.885 --> 20:58.828
WE KNOW AT THE VERY LEAST HE WAS
AWAKE DURING THE BLACKOUT,

20:58.828 --> 21:01.531
AND HE MAY HAVE BEEN IN CONTACT
WITH ANOTHER PERSON

21:01.531 --> 21:03.863
WHO WAS ALSO AWAKE.
WE DON'T EVEN KNOW
HIS REAL NAME YET,

21:03.863 --> 21:06.866
BUT HE'S USING THE ALIAS
"D. GIBBONS."

21:06.866 --> 21:09.469
HE'S HIGHLY EFFICIENT
IN ADVANCE COMPUTING EQUIPMENT

21:09.469 --> 21:11.000
AND PARTICLE PHYSICS
SIMULATION.

21:11.000 --> 21:12.942
APPARENTLY HE'S BEEN
HACKING INTO A NUMBER

21:12.942 --> 21:14.604
OF HIGH-TECH FACILITIES.

21:14.604 --> 21:17.447
HE ALSO SEEMS TO HAVE
A PENCHANT FOR CHESS.

21:17.447 --> 21:19.909
HMM... A TECHIE,
CHESS-PLAYING...

21:19.909 --> 21:22.281
SOCIAL MISFIT PHYSICIST.

21:22.281 --> 21:24.314
WELL, THAT SHOULD
NARROW IT DOWN.

21:24.314 --> 21:27.657
HAVE YOU EVER SEEN HIM BEFORE
AT, UH, CONFERENCES OR LECTURES?

21:27.657 --> 21:30.660
NO. BUT IF HE HAD ANYTHING
TO DO WITH THE BLACKOUT,

21:30.660 --> 21:32.922
I'LL DO EVERYTHING I CAN
TO HELP YOU FIND HIM.

21:32.922 --> 21:35.925
AT THE VERY LEAST, I'D LIKE
TO GIVE HIS TESTICLES A SQUEEZE

21:35.925 --> 21:40.029
FOR SHARKING
MY PLASMA AFTERBURNER DESIGN.

21:40.029 --> 21:43.803
I NEED TO FIND SOMEWHERE
WHERE MY SON CAN BE SAFE.

21:43.803 --> 21:45.505
SOUTHLAND UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL.

21:45.505 --> 21:48.338
THAT--THAT'S LESS SECURE
THAN THIS HOSPITAL.

21:48.338 --> 21:51.541
MAYBE I'M NOT
MAKING MYSELF CLEAR.
YOU DON'T SEEM VERY GOOD
AT THAT, NO.

21:51.541 --> 21:53.042
I BEG YOUR PARDON?

21:53.042 --> 21:54.914
THE ANNOUNCEMENT
THIS MORNING,

21:54.914 --> 21:56.846
YOU SAID THAT YOU CAUSED
THE BLACKOUT,

21:56.846 --> 21:59.719
AND THEN YOU SAID
THAT YOU DIDN'T MEAN TO.

21:59.719 --> 22:02.021
IT WAS ALL KIND OF A JUMBLE.

22:02.021 --> 22:03.693
IN MY EXPERIENCE,

22:03.693 --> 22:05.955
INNOCENT PEOPLE
TEND TO SPEAK IN SPECIFICS.

22:05.955 --> 22:08.728
N-NO, NO, NO, NO.
I-I-I SPOKE IN SPECIFICS,

22:08.728 --> 22:11.060
I-I RELATED A SERIES OF FACTS,
AND NOW I'M--

22:11.060 --> 22:13.763
SOUTHLAND UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL.
I CAN TRANSFER YOUR SON THERE.

22:13.763 --> 22:17.637
YOU WANT ME TO PUT IT THROUGH?
NO I WANT YOU...

22:17.637 --> 22:19.639
I NEED YOU TO FIND

22:19.639 --> 22:22.872
A SECURE FACILITY

22:22.872 --> 22:24.714
FOR MY SON.

22:24.714 --> 22:27.046
LET'S TRY TRAVERS.

22:27.046 --> 22:29.579
IT'S A PRIVATE
CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL IN GLENDALE.

22:29.579 --> 22:32.622
I DOUBT THEY HAVE ANY BEDS.
THEY WILL WHEN I MAKE THE CALL.

22:32.622 --> 22:36.025
(opens drawer)
YOU GET THAT STARTED AND I'LL
DRAW UP THE TRANSFER NOTE.

22:36.025 --> 22:38.958
BE BACK IN AN HOUR.

22:38.958 --> 22:40.730
THANK YOU.

22:40.730 --> 22:43.032
I, UH, DON'T SUPPOSE I CAN
EXPECT ANYONE TO HELP ME MUCH

22:43.032 --> 22:45.034
FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE.

22:45.034 --> 22:47.537
YOU NEED HELP,
I'LL HELP YOU.

22:53.943 --> 22:58.107
"AND I SAW THE HOLY CITY,
NEW JERUSALEM

22:58.107 --> 23:02.381
"COMING DOWN FROM GOD
OUT OF HEAVEN,

23:02.381 --> 23:05.515
"PREPARED AS A BRIDE
ADORNED FOR HER HUSBAND.

23:05.515 --> 23:10.890
WE'RE HERE TO SAY
A FINAL GOOD-BYE TO JOYCE.

23:10.890 --> 23:13.863
(whoosh)
(Demetri)
AND YOU SAW ME THERE?

23:13.863 --> 23:16.966
YEAH. UH, NO.

23:16.966 --> 23:19.899
BUT I'M POSITIVE YOU WERE.

23:19.899 --> 23:21.531
(whoosh)

23:21.531 --> 23:24.474
JOYCE'S DEATH IS
A TRAGIC LOSS.

23:24.474 --> 23:28.538
WE'VE LOST A DAUGHTER,
A WIFE, A FRIEND.

23:28.538 --> 23:32.882
BUT WHAT WE MUST REMEMBER,
WHAT WE MOST HOLD IN OUR HEARTS

23:32.882 --> 23:35.885
EVEN WHEN THEY'RE AS HEAVY
AS THEY ARE TONIGHT...

23:42.652 --> 23:46.095
(horn honks)

23:46.095 --> 23:50.159
(man) â™ª JOLLY OLD ST. NICHOLAS,
LEAN YOUR EAR THIS WAY â™ª

23:50.159 --> 23:53.032
â™ª DON'T YOU TELL
A SINGLE SOUL â™ª

23:53.032 --> 23:56.706
LOOKS LIKE WE FOUND HER.

23:56.706 --> 24:00.039
â™ª CHRISTMAS EVE IS COMING SOON,
NOW, YOU DEAR OLD MAN â™ª

24:00.039 --> 24:02.011
(whispers) OKAY.

24:02.011 --> 24:04.914
(speaking Cantonese)

24:21.090 --> 24:24.063
YOU SHOULDN'T
HAVE COME HERE.

24:24.063 --> 24:27.096
YOU CALLED ME, REMEMBER?
THAT WAS A MISTAKE, CLEARLY.

24:27.096 --> 24:30.069
YOU BEING HERE NOW,
YOU'VE SET THINGS IN MOTION

24:30.069 --> 24:32.101
THAT WILL END
VERY BADLY FOR YOU.

24:32.101 --> 24:34.874
CAN WE JUST SKIP OVER

24:34.874 --> 24:37.977
ALL THE HISTRIONIC
ACTION MOVIE CLICHÃ©S?

24:37.977 --> 24:41.080
'CAUSE I'M WAY TOO JET-LAGGED TO
DEAL WITH ANY OF THAT RIGHT NOW.

24:41.080 --> 24:43.983
TELL ME WHO YOU'RE ARE.

24:43.983 --> 24:46.916
I CAN'T.

24:46.916 --> 24:49.559
WHY DID YOU CALL ME?

24:49.559 --> 24:54.193
I WAS TRYING TO WARN YOU.
YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW ME. WHY DO
YOU CARE IF I LIVE OR DIE?

24:54.193 --> 24:58.097
YOUR DEATH IS THE FIRST
IN A LONG LINE OF DOMINOES

24:58.097 --> 25:00.099
THAT I'D RATHER NOT
SEE FALL DOWN.

25:00.099 --> 25:03.703
SO HELP US STOP IT
FROM HAPPENING.
I CAN'T.

25:03.703 --> 25:06.175
YOU CAN... BY TELLING US.

25:06.175 --> 25:09.238
IF I TELL YOU MORE,
THE ACT OF TELLING YOU

25:09.238 --> 25:12.111
MAY END UP BRINGING ABOUT
THE UNFORTUNATE INCIDENT

25:12.111 --> 25:16.986
WE ARE ALL TRYING TO AVOID.
I'M WILLING TO TAKE THAT RISK.

25:19.518 --> 25:22.952
I SAID YOU WILL BE SHOT
THREE TIMES,

25:22.952 --> 25:26.095
SHOTS AT CLOSE RANGE.

25:26.095 --> 25:28.598
WHICH MEANS
I PROBABLY KNOW MY KILLER.

25:28.598 --> 25:29.899
IN FACT, YOU DO.

25:29.899 --> 25:33.933
HE IS SITTING AT THIS TABLE
RIGHT NOW.

25:39.168 --> 25:42.541
YOU, AGENT BENFORD.

25:43.643 --> 25:47.617
YOU WILL KILL AGENT NOH
ON MARCH 15th

25:47.617 --> 25:51.781
WITH THE VERY GUN I ASSUME
YOU'RE CARRYING RIGHT NOW--

25:51.781 --> 25:56.686
A SIG SAUER MODEL P226.

25:56.686 --> 25:59.929
WAIT. ON THE CALL, YOU SAID
YOU DIDN'T KNOW WHO KILLED ME,

25:59.929 --> 26:02.061
AND NOW YOU'RE SAYING
THAT YOU DO.
I LIED.

26:02.061 --> 26:04.033
I DIDN'T WANT TO BRING ABOUT

26:04.033 --> 26:07.066
THE INCIDENT
WHICH I TOLD YOU ABOUT.

26:07.066 --> 26:09.899
HOW COULD YOU POSSIBLY KNOW?

26:09.899 --> 26:13.242
A-5-6-

26:13.242 --> 26:16.946
1-9-8-4.

26:21.080 --> 26:24.283
AND, UM, WHAT IS THAT?

26:24.283 --> 26:26.786
THE SERIAL NUMBER
OF YOUR GUN.

26:49.639 --> 26:53.212
IT WILL BE YOUR GUN,
AGENT BENFORD,

26:53.212 --> 26:56.946
AND YOU WILL PULL THE TRIGGER
AND THEN AGAIN

26:56.946 --> 26:58.888
AND THEN AGAIN.

26:58.888 --> 27:01.050
YOU COULD HAVE FOUND
THE SERIAL NUMBER

27:01.050 --> 27:04.223
A DIFFERENT WAY.
YOU COULD HAVE HACKED IN

27:04.223 --> 27:08.297
TO THE BUREAU'S GUN REGISTRY.
AGENT NOH, HOW MANY TIMES HAVE
YOU INTERROGATED A SUSPECT?

27:08.297 --> 27:11.060
LOOK INTO MY EYES.

27:11.060 --> 27:15.004
YOUR PARTNER IS GOING
TO KILL YOU--INTENTIONALLY.

27:15.004 --> 27:19.939
(whispers) WHY WOULD I DO THAT?
HMM? WHY?

27:19.939 --> 27:21.941
PRESUMABLY,
IN THE NEXT FEW MONTHS

27:21.941 --> 27:24.073
A REASON WILL PRESENT ITSELF.

27:24.073 --> 27:27.777
NOW YOU'VE GOT
WHAT YOU'VE COME FOR.
NO. COME ON.
I HAVE MORE QUESTIONS.

27:27.777 --> 27:31.020
I AM DONE GIVING YOU ANSWERS.
IT'S TIME FOR YOU TO LEAVE.

27:36.786 --> 27:37.987
DON'T.

27:37.987 --> 27:39.729
(grunts)
AAH!

27:39.729 --> 27:43.062
(people screaming)
YOU'RE COMING
WITH US RIGHT NOW.

27:43.062 --> 27:45.364
MOVE! MOVE!
WHAT ARE WE DOING, MARK?

27:45.364 --> 27:48.067
MOVE!

27:48.067 --> 27:50.399
COVER ME!
DOWN!

27:50.399 --> 27:53.743
GIVE ME A HAND!
GIVE ME A HAND!
(Demetri) WHAT ARE YOU DOING,
MARK?

27:53.743 --> 27:55.674
WHAT'S THE PLAY?
TRUST ME. I GOT IT.

27:55.674 --> 27:58.677
(sirens wailing,
tires screech)
DAMN!

28:03.112 --> 28:05.755
BACK OFF NOW!
(tires screech)

28:05.755 --> 28:06.956
(indistinct shouting)

28:06.956 --> 28:09.919
(helicopter blades whirring)

28:20.830 --> 28:23.833
(man) FREEZE! PUT DOWN THE GUN!
(man) FREEZE!

28:23.833 --> 28:26.305
PUT DOWN THE GUN.
PUT THE GUN DOWN.

28:31.180 --> 28:32.942
(siren bleeps)

28:47.056 --> 28:49.028
HEY, MARK.

28:49.028 --> 28:53.162
THIS WOMAN IS A MATERIAL WITNESS
TO A MURDER.

28:53.162 --> 28:55.204
THERE'S BEEN NO MURDER.

28:55.204 --> 28:59.108
BUT THERE WILL BE.
WILL THERE, AGENT BENFORD?

28:59.108 --> 29:01.070
LET HER GO.

29:01.070 --> 29:03.042
MARK.

29:03.042 --> 29:05.014
(breathing heavily)

29:07.046 --> 29:11.050
NHADRA, HAVE YOUR MEN
LOWER THEIR GUNS. NOW.

29:15.424 --> 29:17.486
(guns clicking)

29:32.041 --> 29:34.773
(grunts)
(man) GET DOWN!
ALL THE WAY DOWN!

29:39.008 --> 29:42.381
YOU--THIS ISN'T OVER.

29:42.381 --> 29:44.383
IT NEVER IS.

29:55.895 --> 30:01.230
(man) â™ª LET'S HAVE
A LOVELY CHRISTMASTIME â™ª

30:01.230 --> 30:04.073
MR. SIMCOE, HEY.

30:04.073 --> 30:07.436
I HAVE DYLAN'S TRANSFER PAPERS.

30:07.436 --> 30:10.109
SORRY FOR ALL THE RED TAPE.
I APPRECIATE IT,

30:10.109 --> 30:12.111
ESPECIALLY AFTER
THE INCONVENIENCE

30:12.111 --> 30:15.144
I'VE CAUSED YOU
AND YOUR FAMILY.
YOU DIDN'T DO ANYTHING WRONG.

30:15.144 --> 30:18.047
ARE YOU READY TO GET DYLAN
CHECKED OUT?
YEP.

30:18.047 --> 30:20.950
YOU REALLY THINK THERE
WON'T BE ANOTHER BLACKOUT?

30:20.950 --> 30:22.952
NOT UNLESS WE RECREATE
THE EXACT CONDITIONS

30:22.952 --> 30:25.394
OF OUR EXPERIMENT, NO.

30:25.394 --> 30:29.128
THAT WAS AN INCREDIBLY
BRAVE THING YOU DID,

30:29.128 --> 30:32.561
COMING FORWARD LIKE THAT,
TAKING RESPONSIBILITY.

30:32.561 --> 30:34.934
I THINK THE LINE

30:34.934 --> 30:39.068
BETWEEN BRAVE AND STUPID'S
A PRETTY BLURRY ONE.
OH, I DIDN'T SAY
IT WASN'T STUPID.

30:39.068 --> 30:41.310
(chuckles) ALL THE SAME,

30:41.310 --> 30:44.273
I'D LIKE TO THINK I DID IT
FOR THE RIGHT REASONS.

30:44.273 --> 30:47.046
SO YOU WENT
TO HARVARD IN '98?

30:47.046 --> 30:49.848
YEAH. IT WAS ONE OF
THE BEST TIMES OF MY LIFE.

30:49.848 --> 30:51.850
I WAS DOING MY DOCTORATE.

30:51.850 --> 30:54.553
I HAD THIS BEAUTIFUL APARTMENT
ABOVE A CIGAR SHOP.

30:54.553 --> 30:56.585
LEAVITT AND PEARCE?
YEAH, THAT'S THE ONE.

30:56.585 --> 30:59.428
I WAS SUPPOSED TO GO
TO HARVARD IN '98,

30:59.428 --> 31:02.461
AND I WAS GONNA LIVE
IN THE BUILDING NEXT DOOR.

31:02.461 --> 31:04.363
SO WHY DIDN'T YOU?
BECAUSE MARK GOT HIS JOB
WITH THE BUREAU,

31:04.363 --> 31:07.366
AND HE WAS GONNA BE TRANSFERRED
TO LOS ANGELES.

31:07.366 --> 31:09.969
SO I DECIDED TO BE
WITH HIM INSTEAD.

31:09.969 --> 31:13.002
MY--MY WIFE MOVED IN
TO THAT BUILDING.

31:13.002 --> 31:15.544
THAT'S HOW I MET HER.

31:15.544 --> 31:17.907
(chuckles) WOW.

31:17.907 --> 31:20.079
SO, UH,

31:20.079 --> 31:23.152
SO IF I HAD GONE,
WE PROBABLY WOULD HAVE MET.

31:26.615 --> 31:30.990
HAVE YOU HEARD OF
THE MANY WORLDS INTERPRETATION?

31:30.990 --> 31:32.421
NO.

31:32.421 --> 31:35.124
IT WAS COINED BY A PHYSICIST
CALLED HUGH EVERETT IN THE '50s.

31:35.124 --> 31:37.626
BASICALLY, THE IDEA IS ANYTHING
THAT COULD HAVE HAPPENED

31:37.626 --> 31:40.529
IN OUR PAST ACTUALLY DID HAPPEN
IN SOME OTHER UNIVERSE.

31:40.529 --> 31:44.073
SO ALL THOSE ALTERNATE DECISIONS
AND CHOICES YOU MADE

31:44.073 --> 31:45.904
ARE STILL PLAYING THEMSELVES OUT
ON OTHER WORLDS.

31:45.904 --> 31:49.238
IF YOU BUY THE THEORY,
I SUPPOSE IN SOME OTHER UNIVERSE

31:49.238 --> 31:51.680
YOU DID GO TO HARVARD...

31:51.680 --> 31:53.912
HMM.

31:53.912 --> 31:56.085
AND WE DID MEET.

31:58.447 --> 32:01.690
OF COURSE, THAT'S NOT
THE WORLD WE LIVE IN.

32:01.690 --> 32:04.023
NOPE.

32:04.023 --> 32:06.125
THANK YOU AGAIN FOR THIS.

32:06.125 --> 32:07.556
SURE.

32:14.063 --> 32:16.635
YOU'RE BOTH VERY LUCKY MEN.

32:16.635 --> 32:19.708
I SAVED YOUR LIVES, HELPED YOU
AVOID AN INTERNATIONAL INCIDENT.

32:19.708 --> 32:22.641
WHY ARE YOU
KEEPING US FROM HER?
YOU DON'T NEED TO KNOW
WHAT NHADRA KNOWS.

32:22.641 --> 32:25.014
SO LET ME GET YOU
ON YOUR FLIGHT, OKAY?

32:25.014 --> 32:28.247
IT'S JUST A FRIENDLY SERVICE
LEGATS PROVIDES.

32:28.247 --> 32:30.379
YOU'RE NOT LEGATS.

32:30.379 --> 32:32.281
IF YOU WERE BUREAU,

32:32.281 --> 32:34.553
YOU NEVER WOULD HAVE
LET US GET OFF THE PLANE.

32:34.553 --> 32:37.386
AND AFTER WHAT WENT DOWN
IN THAT ALLEY,

32:37.386 --> 32:42.191
THIS WHOLE THING STINKS
LIKE A COMPANY JOB.
WE PREFER THE TERM
CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY.

32:45.394 --> 32:49.638
I HATE TO BREAK IT TO YOU,
BUT MOSAIC IS BIGGER THAN YOU--

32:49.638 --> 32:51.640
BIGGER THAN THE FBI,

32:51.640 --> 32:54.403
BIGGER THAN ANY ONE COUNTRY'S
INTELLIGENCE ORGANIZATION.

32:54.403 --> 32:56.605
YOU'RE JUST A-A TINY SPECK,
MARK,

32:56.605 --> 32:59.608
A FLAKE OF DANDRUFF ON THE NAPE
OF THIS THING'S NECK.

32:59.608 --> 33:01.680
BUT IF IT WOULD
MAKE YOU FEEL BETTER

33:01.680 --> 33:05.314
TO TAKE A SWING AT ME,
THEN GO RIGHT AHEAD.

33:05.314 --> 33:08.087
IT'S NOT LIKE YOU GOT
ANYTHING ELSE TO LOSE.

33:08.087 --> 33:10.259
(cell phone rings)

33:10.259 --> 33:12.991
(ring)

33:12.991 --> 33:14.663
(ring)

33:14.663 --> 33:19.098
THAT CALL I WOULD TAKE.
(ring)

33:19.098 --> 33:21.270
You know what I'm staring at?

33:21.270 --> 33:25.174
I'M WATCHING THE SECURITY CAMERA
FEED OF YOUR AMAZING POOCH-SCREW

33:25.174 --> 33:27.536
in Hong Kong.
STAN--

33:27.536 --> 33:29.738
SHUT UP. IT WAS SENT TO ME

33:29.738 --> 33:31.740
by the damn
U.S. Ambassador to China.

33:31.740 --> 33:33.742
SO I'M CALLING
TO CONGRATULATE YOU.

33:33.742 --> 33:39.088
YOU'VE SUCCEEDED
IN CHANGING THE FUTURE.

33:39.088 --> 33:42.051
YEAH, I GOT IT.

33:48.427 --> 33:51.330
HERE.

33:51.330 --> 33:54.163
WEDECK'S ORDERS.

33:57.035 --> 33:59.108
LOOKS LIKE WE FINALLY
HAVE SOMETHING IN COMMON.

34:02.040 --> 34:05.144
NEITHER OF US ARE FBI.

34:11.820 --> 34:14.523
THEY HAVE BEEN FOLLOWING YOU
EVER SINCE

34:14.523 --> 34:16.525
YOU DESTROYED THAT DOLL FACTORY.

34:16.525 --> 34:19.228
YOU ARE FORTUNATE
THEY DID NOT SEE YOU TONIGHT.

34:19.228 --> 34:21.690
COMING HERE WAS A MISTAKE.

34:21.690 --> 34:24.593
I CAN'T PROTECT YOU.

34:26.465 --> 34:30.699
THEN I'LL JUST HAVE TO FIND
SOMEONE WHO CAN.

34:38.647 --> 34:41.180
(doorbell rings)

34:44.082 --> 34:46.084
CAN I COME IN?

34:48.617 --> 34:50.619
MRS. NOH,
I THINK I UNDERSTAND WHY

34:50.619 --> 34:53.862
YOU DIDN'T WANT TO TALK TO ME
ABOUT OUR WEDDING.
ZOEY--

34:53.862 --> 34:57.826
WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT THIS,
ABOUT WHAT I SAW.

34:57.826 --> 35:01.099
(whoosh)

35:01.099 --> 35:04.603
YOU WERE THERE WITH MR. NOH.

35:06.275 --> 35:09.278
(whoosh)
I DIDN'T SEE DEMETRI.

35:09.278 --> 35:11.140
AND I REALIZED SOMETHING--

35:11.140 --> 35:14.683
NO MATTER HOW MUCH
I BEGGED YOU...

35:14.683 --> 35:17.246
YOU'D NEVER COME
TO OUR WEDDING.

35:17.246 --> 35:18.587
ZOEY--

35:18.587 --> 35:21.890
BUT YOU WOULDN'T MISS
YOUR SON'S FUNERAL.

35:25.194 --> 35:27.456
WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL US?

35:29.528 --> 35:32.261
TALKING ABOUT IT WITH YOU...

35:32.261 --> 35:34.603
WITH ANYONE...

35:34.603 --> 35:37.135
THAT WOULD MAKE IT REAL.

35:37.135 --> 35:39.868
MAYBE BEFORE ALL THIS,
WE WOULD HAVE HAD DIFFICULTIES

35:39.868 --> 35:42.211
WITH YOU MARRYING OUR SON.

35:42.211 --> 35:44.873
BUT WHAT I SAW THAT DAY,
THAT MOMENT...

35:44.873 --> 35:48.477
(whoosh)
THE LOVE YOU HAVE
FOR DEMETRI...

35:50.449 --> 35:51.920
(whoosh)

35:51.920 --> 35:53.882
(voice breaking)
I WANT YOU TO KNOW

35:53.882 --> 35:57.186
WE SEE THINGS
DIFFERENTLY NOW,

35:57.186 --> 36:01.190
AND WE'D BE PROUD FOR YOU
TO BE A PART OF OUR FAMILY.

36:01.190 --> 36:04.493
WE WISH THAT WAS THE FUTURE.

36:04.493 --> 36:06.835
WE WISH THAT
MORE THAN ANYTHING.

36:06.835 --> 36:10.168
WE CAN DO MORE THAN WISH,
MRS. NOH.

36:10.168 --> 36:13.242
WE CAN CHANGE THE FUTURE.

36:13.242 --> 36:16.205
(John Lennon)
â™ª SO THIS IS CHRISTMAS â™ª

36:18.176 --> 36:20.849
â™ª AND WHAT HAVE YOU DONE? â™ª

36:23.552 --> 36:25.554
(Scrooge) ANSWER ONE QUESTION.

36:25.554 --> 36:27.786
ARE THESE THE SHADOWS
OF THINGS THAT WILL BE

36:27.786 --> 36:29.788
OR THAT MAY BE?
OH, SPIRIT, HEAR ME.

36:29.788 --> 36:31.790
I'M NOT THE MAN I WAS.

36:31.790 --> 36:34.663
WHY SHOW ME THIS
IF I AM PAST ALL HOPE?

36:34.663 --> 36:37.426
ASSURE ME THAT I MAY YET
CHANGE THESE SHADOWS

36:37.426 --> 36:39.828
THAT YOU'VE SHOWN ME
BY AN ALTERED LIFE.

36:39.828 --> 36:42.331
I WILL LIVE IN THE PAST,
THE PRESENT AND THE FUTURE

36:42.331 --> 36:44.833
AND NOT SHUT OUT THE LESSONS
THAT THEY TEACH.

36:44.833 --> 36:46.935
â™ª AND THE DEAR ONE â™ª

36:46.935 --> 36:50.679
â™ª THE OLD AND THE YOUNG â™ª

36:50.679 --> 36:52.941
I'M SORRY.

36:52.941 --> 36:55.414
â™ª A VERY MERRY CHRISTMAS â™ª

36:55.414 --> 36:57.716
WHAT ARE YOU SORRY FOR?

36:57.716 --> 37:01.590
IT'S MY MURDER, MY PROBLEM.

37:01.590 --> 37:04.793
MEANWHILE, I'M SITTING HERE
WITH YOUR BADGE IN MY POCKET.

37:04.793 --> 37:08.957
I'M NOT GONNA SHOOT YOU,
DEM.

37:08.957 --> 37:12.701
I'M NOT GONNA LET THIS
INVESTIGATION KILL YOU EITHER,

37:12.701 --> 37:15.003
NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS.

37:15.003 --> 37:17.506
â™ªâ™ª

37:17.506 --> 37:19.868
â™ª FOR WEAK AND FOR STRONG â™ª

37:19.868 --> 37:21.610
SMILE, BRYCE.

37:21.610 --> 37:23.742
HAVEN'T YOU HEARD IT'S THE MOST
WONDERFUL TIME OF YEAR?

37:23.742 --> 37:25.644
WHAT'S THIS?

37:25.644 --> 37:27.916
OPEN IT AND FIND OUT.

37:27.916 --> 37:31.249
â™ªâ™ª

37:31.249 --> 37:32.921
â™ª SO HAPPY CHRISTMAS â™ª

37:32.921 --> 37:35.624
IT'S A LUCKY CAT--
MANEKINEKO IN JAPANESE.

37:35.624 --> 37:38.857
DEPENDING UPON
WHICH PAW IS RAISED,

37:38.857 --> 37:41.430
IT PROMISES DIFFERENT THINGS
FOR YOUR FUTURE.

37:41.430 --> 37:43.432
WELL, WHAT DOES
THE RIGHT PAW INDICATE?

37:43.432 --> 37:46.995
LUCK IN LOVE.

37:46.995 --> 37:49.368
(chuckles) THANKS, NICOLE.

37:49.368 --> 37:52.641
DON'T WORRY. YOU'LL FIND HER.

37:52.641 --> 37:55.844
â™ª A VERY MERRY CHRISTMAS â™ª

37:55.844 --> 37:57.806
I GOTTA GO.

37:57.806 --> 38:00.349
â™ª NEW YEAR â™ª

38:00.349 --> 38:03.782
I'M NOT SURVEILLING YOU
AGAIN.

38:03.782 --> 38:06.555
I PROMISE I'M HERE
ON A PERSONAL MATTER. I SWEAR.

38:06.555 --> 38:11.289
HOW CAN I HELP YOU?
DO YOU REMEMBER THAT WHOLE
NOT-GIVING-UP THING

38:11.289 --> 38:13.862
WE WERE TALKING ABOUT EARLIER?
MM-HMM.

38:13.862 --> 38:17.396
IF I WAS TO START TRYING NOW,
WHAT EXACTLY SHOULD I BE DOING?

38:17.396 --> 38:20.899
FIRST OF ALL, THIS IS
FOR A PRENATAL VITAMIN--

38:20.899 --> 38:22.901
UM, THAT'S ALL GREAT.

38:22.901 --> 38:27.676
UM, I NEED SOMETHING
A LITTLE MORE BASIC, THOUGH.

38:27.676 --> 38:30.709
I'M ACTUALLY GONNA
BE DOING THIS ALONE,

38:30.709 --> 38:34.613
AND THE WHOLE... PENIS THING

38:34.613 --> 38:36.915
IS KIND OF A PROBLEM
FOR ME...

38:36.915 --> 38:40.819
'CAUSE I DON'T LIKE THEM.

38:40.819 --> 38:43.321
OH. YOU'RE--YOU'RE GAY.

38:43.321 --> 38:45.594
I'M SUPER GAY.
YOU'RE SUPER GAY.

38:45.594 --> 38:48.727
YEAH.
AND YOU NEED A SPERM BANK.

38:48.727 --> 38:50.999
YEAH.
I KNOW OF A GOOD ONE--
UH, CUBIT FERTILITY CLINIC.

38:50.999 --> 38:53.602
THERE'S A DOCTOR
BY THE NAME OF JANE PARKER.

38:53.602 --> 38:56.405
JUST TELL HER I SENT YOU.
SHE'S GREAT.

38:56.405 --> 38:58.737
THANK YOU, DR. VARLEY.
I REALLY APPRECIATE IT.

38:58.737 --> 39:01.009
NO PROBLEM.

39:03.942 --> 39:06.575
HMM.

39:06.575 --> 39:09.418
YOU'RE GONNA LOVE
THE AMBULANCE, DYLAN.

39:09.418 --> 39:12.581
(man whispers)
UH, RIGHT THERE.

39:16.054 --> 39:18.757
MR. SIMCOE, I'M JOHN.
MY PARTNER HERE IS REED.

39:18.757 --> 39:22.030
WE'LL BE TRANSPORTING YOU
AND YOUR SON.
THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT.

39:22.030 --> 39:23.862
ALL READY TO GO?
DR. BENFORD.

39:23.862 --> 39:26.495
JUST CAME TO SEE
THE TWO OF YOU OFF,

39:26.495 --> 39:28.867
MAKE SURE EVERYTHING WENT OKAY.
YOU READY FOR YOUR TRIP,
LITTLE MAN?

39:28.867 --> 39:31.940
YEAH, HE'S READY.
HE'S JUST A LITTLE SHY.

39:31.940 --> 39:35.043
I'M NOT SURE IF YOU'VE HAD YOUR
TRAINING, BUT DYLAN'S AUTISTIC.

39:35.043 --> 39:37.606
OH, WE'VE HAD TRAINING.
OKAY, GOOD, SWEETIE.

39:37.606 --> 39:40.679
READY TO GET IN THE AMBULANCE
WITH THESE GUYS AND DAD?

39:40.679 --> 39:43.652
COME ON. LET'S DO IT.

39:43.652 --> 39:44.783
THERE WE GO.

39:44.783 --> 39:46.955
YEAH, IT'S GONNA BE FUN.

39:46.955 --> 39:51.019
I GOT A SECRET FOR YOU--
COOL PEOPLE CALL 'EM "AMBOS."

39:51.019 --> 39:52.961
AMBOS?
AMBOS, THAT'S RIGHT.

39:52.961 --> 39:55.023
AMBOS.
THAT'S RIGHT.

39:55.023 --> 39:57.726
(man speaks indistinctly)
YOU'RE GONNA GO
FOR A RIDE IN THE AMBO.

39:57.726 --> 39:59.998
NO!
IT'S OKAY. IT'S OKAY.
IT'S OKAY.

39:59.998 --> 40:01.069
ALL RIGHT, NO RESTRAINTS.
JUST ON THE LEGS.

40:01.069 --> 40:05.604
(man) IT'S ALL RIGHT, BUDDY.
BYE, DYLAN.

40:05.604 --> 40:06.975
I'LL MISS YOU, KIDDO.

40:06.975 --> 40:10.879
SEE YOU INSIDE.
THANKS, GUYS.

40:13.141 --> 40:16.144
SO I GUESS THIS IS THE PART
WHERE WE, UH...

40:16.144 --> 40:19.147
WISH EACH OTHER A NICE LIFE.

40:19.147 --> 40:21.520
SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

40:21.520 --> 40:24.693
COME HERE.

40:31.059 --> 40:35.003
SO THE MANY WORLDS THEORY
THAT YOU TALKED ABOUT EARLIER,

40:35.003 --> 40:37.005
IS THAT SOMETHING
YOU BELIEVE IN?

40:37.005 --> 40:41.069
WELL, MANY PHYSICISTS DO
THESE DAYS.
YOU DIDN'T ANSWER THE QUESTION.

40:41.069 --> 40:43.572
AND OUT OF RESPECT, UM,

40:43.572 --> 40:45.443
I'M NOT GOING TO.

40:48.747 --> 40:51.079
THANK YOU AGAIN, OLIVIA...

40:52.981 --> 40:54.853
AND GOOD-BYE.

40:54.853 --> 40:56.985
WAIT, WAIT. HANG ON THERE.

40:56.985 --> 41:00.028
WHOA, HOLD ON.
HOLD ON, BUDDY.

41:00.028 --> 41:02.531
NO AMBO! NO AMBO!

41:02.531 --> 41:04.763
HEY! HEY, GUYS!
LET GO OF HIS ARM.
IT'S OKAY.

41:04.763 --> 41:06.895
(Dylan) OW!
COME ON, YOU SAID
YOU WERE TRAINED.

41:06.895 --> 41:09.498
WE DON'T HAVE TIME FOR THIS.
HUH?

41:09.498 --> 41:11.970
COME ON. WE'RE ON
A SCHEDULE HERE, LADIES.
EXCUSE ME?
BILL, CAN YOU GET DOWN HERE?

41:11.970 --> 41:13.902
YEAH.
(Dylan) NO AMBO!

41:13.902 --> 41:17.045
(Olivia) UH, I DON'T KNOW

(grunts)

41:17.045 --> 41:19.578
(Dylan screaming) NO! NO!
NO, STOP!
(man) GET IN THE VAN!

41:19.578 --> 41:22.551
NO, NO, NO! PLEASE, PLEASE,
PLEASE DON'T HURT HER.
GET IN THE VAN, MR. SIMCOE.

41:22.551 --> 41:25.584
I'LL COME WITH YOU. PLEASE!
GET IN THE VAN!

41:25.584 --> 41:28.657
(Dylan screaming) NO!
DYLAN? DYLAN?

41:28.657 --> 41:30.919
IT'S GONNA BE OKAY. AAH!
NO!

41:33.592 --> 41:34.993
DAD!

41:34.993 --> 41:38.126
DON'T TAKE HIM! DAD! NO!

41:38.126 --> 41:39.968
(tires screech)

41:39.968 --> 41:41.970
DAD!

41:44.703 --> 41:46.635
(screams)
