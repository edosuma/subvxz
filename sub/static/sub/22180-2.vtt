WEBVTT

00:01.500 --> 00:05.266
Okay... we are down to Nantucket
Mist or Cappuccino Foam.

00:08.596 --> 00:11.940
You're sure you don't like Ionian Grotto.

00:11.941 --> 00:13.356
No

00:13.653 --> 00:15.787
I do like grottos.

00:15.788 --> 00:16.721
And the Ionians.

00:16.722 --> 00:18.623
- Who doesn't?
- Hi, Dad.

00:18.624 --> 00:21.226
They loved art, philosophy, democracy.

00:21.227 --> 00:23.275
One of my all-time favorite
ancient civilizations.

00:23.276 --> 00:26.731
Okay, great. But which one
says warm and welcoming kitchen?

00:26.732 --> 00:29.768
You know, stylish without trying?

00:29.769 --> 00:31.770
Aren't those all the same?

00:31.771 --> 00:32.771
Seriously, Dad?

00:32.772 --> 00:35.373
No, they're completely different.

00:35.374 --> 00:37.175
You should get all
three and see which one

00:37.176 --> 00:38.810
really pops on the wall.

00:38.811 --> 00:41.213
Look how smart college is making you.

00:41.214 --> 00:42.347
Here you go, Hieronymus.

00:42.348 --> 00:45.050
- Oh, an Ionian pet name. I like it.
- Hmm.

00:45.051 --> 00:47.385
And I have construction and
materials class in five. Ciao.

00:47.386 --> 00:48.520
All right, thanks for helping, Noodle.

00:48.521 --> 00:50.055
- Love you.
- I lo...

00:54.759 --> 00:56.828
Okay, I'll pick up a
quart of each of these

00:56.829 --> 00:58.163
on my way home tonight. Yeah, great.

00:58.164 --> 00:59.564
We'll-we'll paint this weekend.

00:59.565 --> 01:01.366
I'm not painting.

01:01.367 --> 01:03.468
Well, okay, Grumpy.
Your dad and I have it.

01:03.469 --> 01:04.936
Uh, we do?

01:04.937 --> 01:06.571
Yes.

01:06.572 --> 01:08.406
You're the original Mr. DIY.

01:08.407 --> 01:09.908
You fixed the washing machine.

01:09.909 --> 01:12.510
Well, that was a part.
Painting is like a craft.

01:12.511 --> 01:14.446
Well, we can be crafty, okay?

01:14.447 --> 01:16.314
It'll be fun. Come on, come on.

01:16.315 --> 01:19.918
We'll get all sweaty and
have a paint fight, okay?

01:19.919 --> 01:21.486
Okay.

01:21.487 --> 01:22.921
Okay.

01:22.922 --> 01:25.022
I'm out. See ya.

01:26.591 --> 01:29.995
We feel good about him driving
himself to school, right?

01:29.996 --> 01:31.796
We feel great about it.

01:33.532 --> 01:36.268
Especially if it means we
get the house to ourselves.

01:36.269 --> 01:37.402
Care to head back upstairs,

01:37.403 --> 01:38.637
- Hieronymus?
- To the grotto?

01:38.638 --> 01:39.871
Well,

01:39.872 --> 01:42.040
the Ionians also had an
appreciation of pleasure.

01:42.041 --> 01:43.507
Stop talking.

01:46.545 --> 01:48.712
"Needed at White House""

01:50.815 --> 01:51.950
Hey.

01:51.951 --> 01:54.586
Traffic is really bad this time of day.

01:54.587 --> 01:56.087
It's the worst.

01:58.823 --> 02:00.625
Hi, hi, hi.

02:00.626 --> 02:02.060
Hi, I'm Dmitri Petrov,

02:02.061 --> 02:05.130
but my cover is Alexander
Mehranov, which...

02:05.131 --> 02:06.398
which, of course, you also know

02:06.399 --> 02:08.999
and now I'm babbling like a...

02:12.805 --> 02:15.874
Oh. Chert.

02:15.875 --> 02:18.642
Chert, chert, chert, chert, chert.

02:20.000 --> 02:26.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:39.264 --> 02:40.231
How do I look?

02:40.232 --> 02:42.834
You mean do you look high?

02:42.835 --> 02:44.168
Do I?

02:45.804 --> 02:47.472
No.

02:47.473 --> 02:49.073
Just nervous.

02:52.043 --> 02:55.613
I haven't taken anything
since yesterday morning.

02:55.614 --> 02:57.782
I'm clean.

02:58.684 --> 03:01.085
Udachi. _

03:05.423 --> 03:07.459
Should I try the house line again?

03:07.460 --> 03:09.761
Just... give her another minute.

03:09.762 --> 03:13.331
Oh...

03:14.333 --> 03:15.767
Good morning.

03:15.768 --> 03:16.868
- Good morning, ma'am.
- Good morning.

03:16.869 --> 03:18.203
Okay.

03:18.204 --> 03:22.606
So... what is the crisis Du jour?

03:23.308 --> 03:27.012
The Libyan civil war is back on.

03:27.013 --> 03:29.014
What? What happened?

03:29.015 --> 03:30.915
Well, about two hours ago,

03:30.916 --> 03:33.551
talks between the
Libyan National Congress

03:33.552 --> 03:35.453
and the Unified Republican Ministry

03:35.454 --> 03:39.124
broke down over control of
the National Oil Company.

03:39.125 --> 03:40.291
So the URM

03:40.292 --> 03:42.794
took the opportunity
to launch an offensive

03:42.795 --> 03:44.396
on the Mabruk oil terminal.

03:44.397 --> 03:47.866
Aren't we offering them like
a-a billion dollars in aid

03:47.867 --> 03:52.137
to bury their hatchets? I mean,
why would they put that at risk?

03:52.138 --> 03:54.105
Reconciliation is hard.

03:54.106 --> 03:56.841
Working through the usual smorgasbord

03:56.842 --> 03:59.444
of power-sharing dilemmas.

03:59.445 --> 04:01.346
Natural resource distribution,

04:01.347 --> 04:04.549
security leadership,
frequency of elections,

04:04.550 --> 04:08.420
local versus centralized power,
counterterrorism strategies.

04:08.421 --> 04:11.423
Your basic 3-D chess

04:11.424 --> 04:14.526
on top of a Jenga tower negotiation?

04:14.527 --> 04:16.961
At least we still have the
aid package for leverage.

04:16.962 --> 04:19.464
Congress is pulling the
plug on the aid package.

04:19.464 --> 04:20.498
Since when?

04:20.499 --> 04:21.499
Ten minutes ago.

04:21.500 --> 04:24.302
The leadership drafted a new amendment

04:24.303 --> 04:26.938
reallocating the Libyan aid to

04:26.939 --> 04:29.007
American farm subsidies.

04:29.008 --> 04:30.775
Because that's what the world needs,

04:30.776 --> 04:32.977
more corn.

04:32.978 --> 04:34.946
Senator Morejon is on
the Senate floor right now

04:34.947 --> 04:36.648
arguing that our aid money

04:36.649 --> 04:38.349
could fall into the hands of terrorists.

04:38.350 --> 04:39.551
And he's not wrong.

04:40.886 --> 04:43.354
They will never make a deal
without the promise of aid.

04:43.355 --> 04:47.024
And we can't give aid
without the promise of a deal.

04:47.759 --> 04:50.929
So, catch-22.

04:50.930 --> 04:53.397
Fantastic.

04:55.700 --> 04:57.068
Not if we can get the Libyans

04:57.069 --> 04:58.870
to agree to a deal
before you sign that bill.

04:58.871 --> 04:59.971
How long can you wait?

04:59.972 --> 05:02.140
Four days.

05:02.141 --> 05:03.408
Any longer,

05:03.409 --> 05:04.943
Congress will start questioning
all our aid packages.

05:04.944 --> 05:08.847
- It'll be a feeding frenzy.
- I can work with that.

05:08.848 --> 05:11.950
We'll start by showing
them how resolved we are

05:11.951 --> 05:13.351
to stand with them

05:13.352 --> 05:15.520
if they choose unity and peace.

05:15.521 --> 05:16.921
And how do you plan on doing that?

05:16.922 --> 05:20.525
I'll go and literally stand with them.

05:20.526 --> 05:22.427
In a conflict zone?

05:22.428 --> 05:23.962
Off the record.

05:23.963 --> 05:25.730
It's still a hell of a risk.

05:25.731 --> 05:28.700
A failed Libya is a much bigger risk.

05:28.701 --> 05:30.635
You're not some random envoy, Elizabeth.

05:30.636 --> 05:32.971
If anything happens to
you, we won't just be sad,

05:32.972 --> 05:34.873
it'd-it'd be an act of war.

05:34.874 --> 05:37.008
I will have my detail
and a Marine Detachment,

05:37.009 --> 05:38.009
I'll be fine.

05:38.010 --> 05:39.010
But with our problems

05:39.011 --> 05:41.646
in Syria, Afghanistan, and Iraq,

05:41.647 --> 05:44.215
we can't afford to let Libya slip away.

05:44.216 --> 05:45.783
Not without a fight.

05:49.688 --> 05:51.188
No heroics, Bess.

05:51.890 --> 05:53.324
And if DS decides to pull the plug

05:53.325 --> 05:54.392
at any point,

05:54.393 --> 05:55.994
I'm authorizing them to pick you up

05:55.995 --> 05:57.061
and throw you back on your plane.

05:57.062 --> 05:58.930
- You got that?
- Yes.

05:58.931 --> 06:01.032
Thank you... sir.

06:02.801 --> 06:04.768
I know.

06:23.788 --> 06:24.956
- Morning.
- Hey, good morning.

06:24.957 --> 06:26.090
Come on.

06:26.091 --> 06:27.125
I'll introduce you to the team.

06:27.126 --> 06:29.027
- They're excited to meet you.
- Yeah.

06:29.028 --> 06:32.330
Since we're sticking with your
cover as a tech consultant,

06:32.331 --> 06:33.498
our front is an I.T. firm.

06:33.499 --> 06:34.899
Makes sense.

06:34.900 --> 06:36.401
Morning, Sally.

06:36.402 --> 06:37.669
Good morning, gentlemen.

06:37.670 --> 06:39.403
This is Alexander Mehranov.

06:41.239 --> 06:42.507
Welcome to the agency.

06:43.676 --> 06:45.042
Thanks.

06:46.110 --> 06:47.912
Don't be fooled by her demeanor.

06:47.913 --> 06:52.116
Word is she can shoot the beak
off a sparrow at 100 yards.

06:52.117 --> 06:54.686
Russian military trained
me not to be fooled.

06:54.687 --> 06:55.853
Especially by Americans.

06:57.889 --> 06:59.657
Dylan Larsen, Molly Reid.

06:59.658 --> 07:03.061
This... is Dmitri Petrov.

07:03.062 --> 07:04.796
It's like seeing a ghost.

07:04.797 --> 07:07.131
Oh, my God, did I say that out loud?

07:07.132 --> 07:08.433
Okay, get it all out.

07:08.434 --> 07:10.568
Because from now on,
he's Alexander Mehranov.

07:10.569 --> 07:11.502
Even here.

07:11.503 --> 07:15.273
Well, nice to meet you, Alexander.

07:15.274 --> 07:16.274
Hey, there.

07:16.275 --> 07:17.475
Or do you prefer Alex?

07:17.476 --> 07:20.778
Uh, yeah, in Phoenix,
most people called me Alex.

07:20.779 --> 07:21.846
Ah.

07:21.847 --> 07:22.747
So...

07:22.748 --> 07:24.501
Just not "Alexi."

07:25.486 --> 07:27.018
Well, you guys are
gonna have plenty of time

07:27.019 --> 07:29.921
to get to know each other,
but, in brief, Dylan is

07:29.922 --> 07:31.689
- ex-Army Rangers.
- Yeah, a few pounds ago.

07:31.690 --> 07:34.092
He transitioned to the
CIA seven years ago.

07:34.093 --> 07:36.261
Molly is career CIA.
She started her career

07:36.262 --> 07:37.962
as a field agent in Chechnya.

07:37.963 --> 07:39.497
Also a few pounds ago.

07:39.498 --> 07:41.733
But you have a better excuse.

07:41.734 --> 07:43.134
I'm due in a couple months.

07:43.135 --> 07:45.169
Um, and you know Alex, of course.

07:45.170 --> 07:47.338
He helped us win a proxy war
against Russia in the Ukraine

07:47.339 --> 07:48.539
a couple of years ago,

07:48.540 --> 07:51.142
and he's the highest-ranking
Russian military official

07:51.143 --> 07:52.443
who's working for us.

07:52.444 --> 07:55.446
His breadth of knowledge about
the greatest geopolitical foe

07:55.447 --> 07:58.950
that we have is, well, it's
unmatched anywhere in the IC.

07:58.951 --> 08:01.119
That's all?

08:01.120 --> 08:04.055
So, let's move on to why we've assembled

08:04.056 --> 08:07.525
all this talent, and
what we hope to achieve.

08:07.526 --> 08:09.761
The Russians are
stepping up their efforts

08:09.762 --> 08:12.430
to bolster the Taliban and undermine

08:12.431 --> 08:16.000
the democratic government in Afghanistan.

08:16.001 --> 08:18.403
I don't have to tell you
how disastrous that would be

08:18.404 --> 08:20.038
to the United States...

08:20.039 --> 08:22.707
well, the entire Western
world, if they were to succeed.

08:22.708 --> 08:25.310
We now have evidence that

08:25.311 --> 08:27.912
they're bribing Afghani
officials in an attempt

08:27.913 --> 08:30.048
to further destabilize the rule of law.

08:30.049 --> 08:32.650
- Sounds like we need to turn one of them.
- Exactly.

08:32.650 --> 08:34.519
Our field office in Kabul has identified

08:34.520 --> 08:36.287
several dozen Russian operatives

08:36.288 --> 08:38.056
working in country.

08:38.057 --> 08:40.857
This is everything we have on them.

08:40.859 --> 08:44.595
Our job is to identify who
would be most likely to turn,

08:44.596 --> 08:47.532
and then formulate an approach.

08:47.533 --> 08:49.534
The director wants us
to be operational fast,

08:49.535 --> 08:53.303
so consider this speed dating.

08:57.942 --> 08:59.544
Since there's scattered fighting

08:59.545 --> 09:02.613
near Tripoli, we'll
corkscrew into Mitiga Airport,

09:02.614 --> 09:05.550
which is about 50 miles south,
where there's less activity.

09:05.551 --> 09:08.820
Then we'll haul ass by ground
up into the Tillisi Hotel,

09:08.821 --> 09:10.455
which is just east of Tripoli.

09:10.456 --> 09:12.190
Corkscrew, as in landing?

09:12.191 --> 09:13.091
That's correct, sir.

09:13.092 --> 09:14.726
Aircraft have been shot down

09:14.727 --> 09:17.161
by both sides with stingers
in the last few months.

09:17.162 --> 09:19.530
Can't risk standard descent procedures.

09:19.531 --> 09:22.767
Well, this pregnant lady is not
bummed to be staying stateside.

09:22.768 --> 09:24.202
Uh, excuse me,

09:24.203 --> 09:27.972
just how corkscrewy are we talking?

09:27.973 --> 09:30.074
Tight radius, so we can
secure everything below

09:30.075 --> 09:31.943
10,000 feet. It's a bit of a ride.

09:31.944 --> 09:33.344
Said the former Air Force colonel.

09:33.345 --> 09:34.612
Well,

09:34.613 --> 09:37.482
extraordinary precautions
to ensure smooth sailing.

09:37.483 --> 09:38.850
What else, Ted?

09:38.851 --> 09:40.785
We'll be traveling with a
small, heavily armed detail

09:40.786 --> 09:42.053
including a Marine Detachment,

09:42.054 --> 09:43.721
a medic and just two of your staff.

09:43.722 --> 09:45.590
Wheels up from Andrews in three hours,

09:45.591 --> 09:47.592
so we can hit Libyan
airspace in the dead of night.

09:47.593 --> 09:48.760
Okay.

09:48.761 --> 09:49.961
That sounds like a plan.

09:49.962 --> 09:51.062
Thanks, Ted.

09:51.063 --> 09:52.496
Thank you.

09:58.503 --> 10:00.671
See...

10:00.672 --> 10:03.841
Now, I'm leaning toward Ionian Grotto.

10:03.842 --> 10:06.444
Strong choice, I love it.

10:06.445 --> 10:08.813
They're all exactly
the same, aren't they?

10:08.814 --> 10:10.247
Pretty much.

10:12.751 --> 10:13.951
Hey.

10:13.952 --> 10:16.621
Did you, uh...

10:16.622 --> 10:20.224
you ever do a corkscrew landing?

10:20.225 --> 10:21.759
Yeah, a few times.

10:21.760 --> 10:23.761
On transports into Iraq.

10:23.762 --> 10:26.831
So it's not a big thing, right?

10:26.832 --> 10:29.934
You're corkscrewing into Libya?

10:29.935 --> 10:31.102
Ooh.

10:31.103 --> 10:32.837
Uh, I-it's not a big deal.

10:32.838 --> 10:36.107
It's kind of like a really
sharp turn that just keeps going.

10:36.108 --> 10:39.710
All right, well, that
doesn't sound so bad.

10:39.711 --> 10:41.612
You just worry about making peace.

10:41.613 --> 10:43.214
Charm them with your Arabic.

10:43.215 --> 10:46.484
Actually, I'm gonna
be using a translator.

10:46.485 --> 10:48.719
I'm not great with the Libyan dialect.

10:48.720 --> 10:52.957
Has too many diphthongs
and interdental fricatives.

10:52.958 --> 10:55.793
Hey. So you're really doing it.

10:55.794 --> 10:58.095
Yeah, it is really getting done.

10:58.096 --> 11:00.465
What do you think?

11:00.466 --> 11:02.767
I love this one.

11:02.768 --> 11:05.503
I was all about Nantucket
Mist ten minutes ago.

11:05.504 --> 11:08.306
Now it's Ionian Grotto.

11:08.307 --> 11:11.375
So, can I take that one?

11:11.376 --> 11:12.777
Sure.

11:12.778 --> 11:14.145
I'm don't think we're
done deliberating...

11:14.146 --> 11:15.880
No. It's dead to me. That's yours.

11:15.881 --> 11:17.381
- Please.
- Awesome.

11:17.382 --> 11:19.417
Jareth's apartment is so drab.

11:19.418 --> 11:21.385
I've been meaning to
spruce up the living room.

11:21.386 --> 11:23.588
You can buy that, you know.
It's on sale at Franklin's.

11:23.589 --> 11:25.756
Or, you know what? It's our treat.

11:25.757 --> 11:27.158
- Really? - Really?
- Yeah, it is.

11:27.159 --> 11:29.827
Wow, thank you so much.

11:29.828 --> 11:31.162
From-from both of us.

11:31.163 --> 11:32.697
All right, that's my ride.

11:32.698 --> 11:33.965
I didn't realize you were going anywhere.

11:33.966 --> 11:36.234
Well, I didn't either,
until this afternoon.

11:36.235 --> 11:38.769
But, uh, that's all I can tell you.

11:38.770 --> 11:40.571
Ah. OTR, I get it.

11:40.572 --> 11:41.639
Good luck, wherever.

11:41.640 --> 11:42.907
Thank you.

11:42.908 --> 11:45.809
It's really high-end paint, you know.

11:48.112 --> 11:51.582
So the corkscrew thing,
it's really gonna be okay?

11:51.583 --> 11:52.817
I promise.

11:52.818 --> 11:55.353
I'm more worried about you
on the ground over there.

11:55.354 --> 11:57.121
POTUS is way ahead of you.

11:57.122 --> 11:58.523
Love you.

11:58.524 --> 12:00.258
I kind of love you.

12:00.259 --> 12:02.093
- Yeah.
- A lot.

12:02.094 --> 12:04.695
- All right.
- Get your bag, get your bag.

12:04.696 --> 12:07.497
We have a painting date when I get back.

12:12.420 --> 12:14.748
_

12:15.106 --> 12:16.574
It felt like a sharp turn

12:16.575 --> 12:17.975
that just kept going and going.

12:17.976 --> 12:19.911
I told you.

12:19.912 --> 12:21.379
Oh. General Hamady has just arrived

12:21.380 --> 12:22.580
at the Tillisi Hotel, ma'am.

12:22.581 --> 12:24.048
That's full negotiating complement.

12:24.049 --> 12:26.717
As long as our tires hold up
on this road, we're good to go.

12:26.718 --> 12:27.818
How far out are we, Matt?

12:27.819 --> 12:28.853
About half an hour, ma'am.

12:28.854 --> 12:30.788
I'll let the parties know.

12:30.789 --> 12:33.324
Good. Um, Jay, can we
review the revenue...

12:35.460 --> 12:36.561
Heads down, heads down!

12:36.562 --> 12:37.695
Whoa, Joe, what happened?

12:37.696 --> 12:38.796
Uh, someone jumped into the road.

12:38.797 --> 12:39.964
Are they armed?

12:39.965 --> 12:41.465
I-I don't know, I can't see.

12:41.466 --> 12:43.333
Ma'am, you stay in the car.

12:45.536 --> 12:48.172
What happened, Joe, did we hit anyone?

12:48.173 --> 12:49.507
Yes, ma'am.

12:49.508 --> 12:52.810
Looks like a child.

12:52.811 --> 12:54.411
Oh, my God.

12:56.581 --> 13:00.284
Oh, my God.

13:02.230 --> 13:07.959
Subtitle sync and corrections by

13:10.732 --> 13:12.629
- Cover Bluebird!
- Where's the doctor?

13:12.630 --> 13:14.380
- Ma'am, I need you to get back in the car.
- Don't we have a medic?

13:14.381 --> 13:16.781
- Oh, my God.
- By the time I saw her, it was too late.

13:16.782 --> 13:19.017
It's not your fault, Joe.
Where is the damn medic?

13:19.018 --> 13:20.118
Ma'am, I need you to get back...

13:20.119 --> 13:21.352
I'm here, I'm here.

13:21.353 --> 13:22.387
Excuse me, ma'am.

13:22.388 --> 13:24.756
Wait.

13:24.757 --> 13:26.191
Oh, my God.

13:26.192 --> 13:27.492
Is she alive?

13:27.493 --> 13:29.627
Uh, yeah, but losing blood.

13:29.628 --> 13:30.862
Jane!

13:30.863 --> 13:32.030
Help me stop the bleeding.

13:32.031 --> 13:33.198
Here.

13:33.199 --> 13:34.666
Here. Press as hard as you can.

13:34.667 --> 13:35.967
Is she gonna make it?

13:35.968 --> 13:37.502
Yeah, but she needs to get to a hospital.

13:37.503 --> 13:39.804
- Well, then let's get her in the car...
- No! Absolutely not.

13:39.805 --> 13:40.805
The road is not clear.

13:40.806 --> 13:42.874
Crowd of potential tangos, 12 o'clock!

13:44.710 --> 13:46.477
Don't shoot, don't shoot.

13:46.478 --> 13:47.679
Ma'am, we need to leave right now.

13:47.680 --> 13:49.380
We are not leaving her lying in the road.

13:49.381 --> 13:51.115
Ma'am, we have a potential
Black Hawk Down situation!

13:51.116 --> 13:54.052
No, Ted!

13:54.053 --> 13:55.720
I'll, uh, I'll stay.

13:55.721 --> 13:57.021
So will I.

13:57.022 --> 13:59.290
This is already a staggering
breach of protocol.

13:59.291 --> 14:01.459
I can't guarantee your safety.

14:01.460 --> 14:03.595
Please, I need you to get
back in the car, right now.

14:03.596 --> 14:04.862
Okay. Okay, okay, okay, okay.

14:04.863 --> 14:06.431
Wait, just do whatever

14:06.432 --> 14:08.566
- you have to do, okay?
- I-I'll do my best.

14:08.567 --> 14:10.000
Thank you.

14:13.739 --> 14:17.008
Aren't you having just
a little bit of fun?

14:17.009 --> 14:20.144
Haven't hardly spent
any time together lately.

14:20.145 --> 14:21.846
I know.

14:21.847 --> 14:23.982
But here we are.

14:23.983 --> 14:25.483
Together.

14:25.484 --> 14:28.486
Besides, you're definitely gonna
score some points with my mom,

14:28.487 --> 14:30.722
'cause she's very into
couples painting these days.

14:30.723 --> 14:33.358
Ah, well. I must be having a blast.

14:33.359 --> 14:34.692
I stand corrected.

14:34.693 --> 14:36.394
Is that a swipe at my mother?

14:36.395 --> 14:37.762
No, no.

14:37.763 --> 14:39.896
It's an honor to be influenced by her.

14:40.632 --> 14:42.634
What?

14:42.635 --> 14:44.636
Why are you being so weird?

14:44.637 --> 14:46.170
Maybe it's just disconcerting

14:46.171 --> 14:48.172
to be under the thumb
of a political dynasty

14:48.173 --> 14:50.275
when you've been disinherited
by your own family.

14:50.276 --> 14:51.676
Whoa. "Dynasty"?

14:51.677 --> 14:53.411
Seriously?

14:53.412 --> 14:55.747
And how are you under anyone's thumb?

14:55.748 --> 14:58.149
It'd just be nice if, every now and then,

14:58.150 --> 15:01.185
you didn't jump through
every single hoop your parents

15:01.186 --> 15:03.321
- put in front of you.
- Oh, my God, what hoops?

15:03.322 --> 15:06.357
Wha... you think I'm some
idiot with no mind of my own?

15:06.358 --> 15:07.692
I never called you an idiot.

15:07.693 --> 15:09.360
Just that I can't think for myself.

15:09.361 --> 15:10.909
Well, here we are
painting because your mum

15:10.910 --> 15:11.843
said it was a good idea.

15:11.844 --> 15:13.264
No, because we decided to paint.

15:13.265 --> 15:14.932
I never said that I wanted
us to do it ourselves.

15:14.933 --> 15:16.668
Well, you never said
that you didn't want to.

15:16.669 --> 15:17.835
Because you wanted to do it.

15:17.836 --> 15:19.327
Well, God forbid you actually tell me

15:19.328 --> 15:21.239
- how you feel about anything.
- I'm telling you now.

15:21.240 --> 15:22.540
Yeah, while trashing my family.

15:22.541 --> 15:23.841
Do you want me to be
honest with you or not?

15:23.842 --> 15:26.678
Of course. Just not after
withholding your true feelings

15:26.679 --> 15:28.012
when we're making a decision,

15:28.013 --> 15:29.447
and then getting all pissed off at me

15:29.448 --> 15:31.783
about how miserable I've made you

15:31.784 --> 15:33.618
because of, I don't know,

15:33.619 --> 15:37.422
my family's oppressive dynastic thumb?

15:37.423 --> 15:38.623
Damn it.

15:38.624 --> 15:39.791
It's work.

15:39.792 --> 15:41.491
Oh, yeah. Of course it is.

15:42.794 --> 15:44.327
Nice.

15:54.739 --> 15:56.341
- Good morning, ma'am.
- Hi. Good morning.

15:56.342 --> 15:57.508
- The parties have gathered.
- Okay.

15:57.509 --> 15:58.810
How are you holding up?

15:58.811 --> 16:03.114
Well, we'll find out soon enough.

16:03.115 --> 16:05.550
How about you?

16:05.551 --> 16:07.552
Oh, I've been praying a lot.

16:07.553 --> 16:09.053
Ma'am, I just heard from Dr. Greene.

16:09.054 --> 16:10.355
And? What about the girl?

16:10.356 --> 16:11.856
She sustained some
pretty bad head trauma,

16:11.857 --> 16:13.624
so they're worried about
her brain swelling up.

16:13.625 --> 16:15.593
Apparently, the next 24 hours is key.

16:15.594 --> 16:17.095
And her family? Did they...?

16:17.096 --> 16:18.529
Her mom and dad are at the hospital.

16:18.530 --> 16:20.131
Turns out, Aya was walking home.

16:20.132 --> 16:24.302
So, that's her-her name, Aya Alsnany.

16:24.303 --> 16:27.839
She was walking home from
her grandparents' house.

16:27.840 --> 16:30.341
And, uh, they got...
when she didn't make it,

16:30.342 --> 16:33.044
they got worried and they found
her eventually at the hospital.

16:33.045 --> 16:35.645
I'm glad they're with her.

16:38.249 --> 16:40.752
Nadine, I-I'd like you
to go to the hospital.

16:40.753 --> 16:42.520
I-I know that's a big ask.

16:42.521 --> 16:43.755
No, of course I'll go.

16:43.756 --> 16:45.590
Honestly, I'm having trouble focusing.

16:45.591 --> 16:46.724
I'd rather be there.

16:46.725 --> 16:48.760
- Thank you.
- Oh, Jay?

16:48.761 --> 16:50.927
Have you got this?

16:52.497 --> 16:54.264
No worries.

16:57.702 --> 16:59.570
Okay. What do we got?

16:59.571 --> 17:00.938
Split decision.

17:00.939 --> 17:04.509
Dylan and I have a serious
crush on Maxim Polyakov.

17:04.510 --> 17:09.513
Russian military official who's
a direct line to the Taliban.

17:09.515 --> 17:11.315
Okay. Who do you like, Alex?

17:11.316 --> 17:14.852
Uh, Osip Bakunin, Russian
embassy attaché in Kabul.

17:14.853 --> 17:17.722
An emissary between
the GRU and the Taliban.

17:17.723 --> 17:20.090
Hmm.

17:20.092 --> 17:21.992
Tell me about Polyakov.

17:21.993 --> 17:25.530
We can connect him to a meeting
with an Afghani drug lord.

17:25.531 --> 17:27.415
Probably a bribe. But, even if it wasn't,

17:27.415 --> 17:28.866
there's no way that
meeting was sanctioned

17:28.867 --> 17:30.234
by the GRU.

17:30.235 --> 17:32.136
We've got him by the balls.

17:32.137 --> 17:33.571
Is there a downside?

17:33.572 --> 17:35.239
He's a bit of a renegade.

17:35.240 --> 17:37.375
There's a risk he could implode.

17:37.376 --> 17:38.676
Uh, I think, um,

17:38.677 --> 17:41.579
Polyakov is even less
stable than they think.

17:41.580 --> 17:45.749
Um... he gets jittery, it could blow us.

17:47.151 --> 17:48.653
Noted. Tell me about Bakunin.

17:48.654 --> 17:51.255
Well, we haven't got as much leverage,

17:51.256 --> 17:53.825
but, uh, he does have a lot of debt.

17:53.826 --> 17:58.196
Offering to pay that off, uh,
could be intriguing to him.

17:58.197 --> 18:00.965
Um, but what I like most about him

18:00.966 --> 18:02.200
is his ideology.

18:02.201 --> 18:03.935
You see, he leans leftward

18:03.936 --> 18:05.236
for a Russian diplomat.

18:05.237 --> 18:07.338
And we have, uh, private correspondences

18:07.339 --> 18:08.840
with a cousin of his,

18:08.841 --> 18:10.842
uh, who is a low-level economic minister

18:10.843 --> 18:13.644
advocating for a more
open, democratic government.

18:13.645 --> 18:15.746
How do we know he's not
just telling the cousin

18:15.747 --> 18:17.048
whatever he wants to hear?

18:17.049 --> 18:21.385
Uh, I recognize the sentiment.

18:21.386 --> 18:23.520
He's not faking it.

18:24.789 --> 18:26.491
We flip him, he'll be stable.

18:26.492 --> 18:28.960
We'll own him for a long time.

18:28.961 --> 18:30.294
Well...

18:30.295 --> 18:31.662
I like the sound of that.

18:31.663 --> 18:33.498
Let's look into the approach.

18:33.499 --> 18:34.899
If he doesn't work out,

18:34.900 --> 18:36.167
then we'll have Polyakov as backup.

18:36.168 --> 18:37.134
Understood.

18:37.135 --> 18:38.402
- Copy that.
- Good work.

18:38.403 --> 18:40.704
Let's call it a day.

18:54.453 --> 18:55.686
I'm so sorry.

18:55.687 --> 18:57.221
It's okay.

18:57.222 --> 18:59.357
- It's okay.
- I... Here.

18:59.358 --> 19:01.492
I never liked this suit.

19:02.594 --> 19:05.296
Here, uh, let me. Or this shirt and tie.

19:05.297 --> 19:07.231
It's okay. No, no, no, no.

19:07.232 --> 19:09.534
It's all right, it's all right,
it's all right, it's all right.

19:09.535 --> 19:13.404
We need those corner mirror thingies.

19:13.405 --> 19:16.874
Not that the Landmarks
Commission will ever allow it.

19:18.610 --> 19:20.244
Uh...

19:20.245 --> 19:23.648
I left the files and
instructions on my desk for you.

19:23.649 --> 19:25.081
Thanks.

19:27.919 --> 19:32.723
Um, do you mind me
asking what's going on?

19:32.724 --> 19:34.258
What have you heard?

19:34.259 --> 19:35.726
Nothing.

19:35.727 --> 19:40.064
You know, I know my mom is
on an off-the-record trip,

19:40.065 --> 19:42.934
and, um, I'm probably being paranoid,

19:42.935 --> 19:44.835
I just... I just, you know,

19:44.836 --> 19:46.470
I just want to make sure that she's okay.

19:46.471 --> 19:47.738
Yep, she's fine.

19:47.739 --> 19:49.807
She's, uh, fit as a fiddle.

19:49.808 --> 19:51.208
Okay. Thank God.

19:51.209 --> 19:53.044
- Thank you.
- I mean, she's, uh...

19:53.045 --> 19:55.479
she's upset,

19:55.480 --> 19:59.283
but fine.

19:59.284 --> 20:01.552
She's in Libya.

20:01.553 --> 20:02.920
Wow.

20:02.921 --> 20:05.623
Don't worry. We have a
small army protecting her.

20:05.624 --> 20:06.791
Yeah, no, of course.

20:06.792 --> 20:08.326
But she ran over a kid.

20:08.327 --> 20:09.560
What?

20:09.561 --> 20:12.663
Not her, personally. Her motorcade.

20:12.664 --> 20:14.865
Oh, my God. That's-that's terrible.

20:14.866 --> 20:16.067
Yeah.

20:16.068 --> 20:17.335
She's alive, though.

20:17.336 --> 20:18.536
The kid.

20:18.537 --> 20:20.137
Things happen.

20:20.138 --> 20:21.639
Stuff you don't plan on.

20:21.640 --> 20:25.443
My whole damn job is dealing
with stuff you don't plan on.

20:25.444 --> 20:28.713
I'm keeping the president waiting here.

20:28.714 --> 20:30.581
You okay?

20:30.582 --> 20:32.750
Yeah.

20:32.751 --> 20:34.952
Um, I think so.

20:34.953 --> 20:36.586
Good.

20:40.224 --> 20:43.526
You don't have to worry about your mom.

20:48.734 --> 20:51.369
I floated an integrated national army

20:51.370 --> 20:52.637
working with U.S. advisors.

20:52.638 --> 20:54.605
They're not crazy about
the U.S. advisors part.

20:54.606 --> 20:56.273
Well, after Iraq and Afghanistan,

20:56.274 --> 20:57.775
I can't say I blame them.

20:57.776 --> 21:00.478
Well, it sounds like
you're making some progress.

21:00.479 --> 21:03.047
Sorry to say it's slower than I'd hoped.

21:03.048 --> 21:04.382
Then you're not gonna like

21:04.383 --> 21:06.250
that we're tightening up your timeline.

21:06.251 --> 21:08.753
DS is worried what it's gonna look like

21:08.754 --> 21:11.522
if news breaks of your accident.

21:11.523 --> 21:13.557
See what you can do in the next day.

21:13.558 --> 21:14.825
Then we're pulling you.

21:14.826 --> 21:17.361
Mr. President, that'd
be... all due respect...

21:17.362 --> 21:18.496
a terrible mistake.

21:18.497 --> 21:19.697
Understood,

21:19.698 --> 21:22.133
but it's not up for debate.

21:22.134 --> 21:24.268
Sorry about all this, Bess.

21:24.269 --> 21:26.037
Uh... thank you, sir.

21:26.038 --> 21:27.371
I should get back in there.

21:27.372 --> 21:28.738
Of course.

21:29.473 --> 21:30.807
Thank you.

21:33.978 --> 21:36.113
So, that's the little changing station.

21:36.114 --> 21:37.448
Ah.

21:37.449 --> 21:40.618
And that's the crib my
mom bought us, thank God.

21:40.619 --> 21:42.253
Aw, very nice.

21:42.254 --> 21:45.256
Well, it's official.

21:45.257 --> 21:46.657
I've become that person.

21:46.658 --> 21:48.426
Well, you're fine. It's when you, uh,

21:48.427 --> 21:51.629
brag about poops and burps
that you start crossing lines.

21:51.630 --> 21:53.364
Though, I-I have to say my little Danny

21:53.365 --> 21:54.598
is a champion burper.

21:54.599 --> 21:56.933
Yeah.

22:01.539 --> 22:03.007
To our new comrade.

22:03.008 --> 22:04.442
Mm.

22:04.443 --> 22:06.243
Don't sell yourself short,
you're off to a strong start.

22:06.244 --> 22:08.045
I get why McCord likes you.

22:08.046 --> 22:09.947
Oh, Bakunin probably won't work out.

22:09.948 --> 22:11.649
We'll end up with Polyakov.

22:11.650 --> 22:12.950
Not to be a dick,

22:12.951 --> 22:14.285
but since you brought it up,

22:14.286 --> 22:17.488
I don't look forward to
turning a Russian operative

22:17.489 --> 22:19.724
without some really scary leverage.

22:19.725 --> 22:21.759
You underestimate the GRU.

22:21.760 --> 22:23.894
Bakunin knows they'd
send him to the Gulag

22:23.895 --> 22:26.097
- for a parking violation.
- True.

22:26.098 --> 22:28.566
So, yeah, their brutality is
our number one recruiting tool.

22:31.235 --> 22:32.703
Funny.

22:32.704 --> 22:35.738
You know what they actually do
to you, uh, in a Russian prison?

22:36.741 --> 22:40.878
They start off with, uh,
with stress positions...

22:40.879 --> 22:42.980
tying you up and hanging
you by your wrists,

22:42.981 --> 22:45.483
stepping down hard on your
joints and your ligaments

22:45.484 --> 22:47.418
until they, uh, they snap.

22:47.419 --> 22:52.356
Then they, uh, attach electrodes.

22:52.357 --> 22:56.360
One jolt is so much pain,

22:56.361 --> 22:58.195
you can't even imagine.

22:58.196 --> 23:03.734
The convulsing so violent
it, uh, cracks ribs.

23:03.735 --> 23:07.637
And the only hope is that
the next one will kill you.

23:13.477 --> 23:16.347
You know, whatever happens
to Bakunin or Polyakov,

23:16.348 --> 23:21.150
it's not a game for pampered
CIA agents to joke about.

23:57.889 --> 24:00.291
...from a brain scan. The
doctor is assessing it now.

24:00.292 --> 24:02.746
- But she's stable.
- Brain injuries are unpredictable.

24:02.747 --> 24:04.781
Her parents are with her
and agreed to see you.

24:04.782 --> 24:07.083
- Right here.
- Thank you.

24:11.021 --> 24:14.291
Mr. and Mrs. Alsnany...

24:14.292 --> 24:16.360
How do you do? I'm Nadine Tolliver.

24:16.361 --> 24:17.694
I am Secretary McCord's

24:17.695 --> 24:21.597
chief of staff. Thank you
very much for seeing me.

24:22.666 --> 24:24.501
What do you want?

24:24.502 --> 24:27.571
The secretary asked me to convey

24:27.572 --> 24:28.839
her deepest sorrow

24:28.840 --> 24:31.341
and well wishes. We all feel

24:31.342 --> 24:33.276
just... awful

24:33.277 --> 24:35.945
about this dreadful accident.

24:42.152 --> 24:44.032
All we want is for our
little girl to come home.

24:46.024 --> 24:48.025
Mr. and Mrs. Alsnany...

24:49.927 --> 24:52.162
I am afraid Aya's scan shows that

24:52.163 --> 24:54.464
her brain has continued to swell.

24:58.002 --> 25:00.470
How can we stop it?

25:00.471 --> 25:02.139
We've done everything we can.

25:02.140 --> 25:03.507
I'm afraid she only has

25:03.508 --> 25:05.976
one more day.

25:07.345 --> 25:09.311
I'm sorry.

25:09.472 --> 25:10.545
_

25:10.565 --> 25:12.004
_

25:12.275 --> 25:13.449
_

25:28.999 --> 25:31.300
That's a good way to cool off.

25:32.803 --> 25:35.439
Alexander, right?

25:35.440 --> 25:38.875
Right. I... You...

25:38.876 --> 25:40.944
- Stephanie.
- Ah.

25:40.945 --> 25:42.212
Stevie. Henry McCord's daughter.

25:42.213 --> 25:43.346
Yeah, right.

25:43.347 --> 25:44.714
Yeah, we met at your place.

25:44.715 --> 25:47.050
- You were all dressed up.
- Right.

25:47.051 --> 25:50.620
- Um, it was for the opera.
- Ah.

25:50.621 --> 25:52.589
Actually, mm... might
have been the philharmonic.

25:52.590 --> 25:54.057
I-I can't remember.

25:54.058 --> 25:55.225
That good, huh?

25:56.727 --> 25:59.796
It's kind of more my fiancé's thing.

25:59.797 --> 26:01.031
- Uh-huh.
- So...

26:03.534 --> 26:06.502
Yeah, he's... he's British, so...

26:07.537 --> 26:09.873
Makes sense.

26:09.874 --> 26:11.475
Not really, actually, I...

26:11.476 --> 26:13.777
- No?
- No. I don't think so.

26:13.778 --> 26:16.079
- Okay. - Not really sure
what I was going for there.

26:16.080 --> 26:17.848
- Uh...
- Sorry, I sound like

26:17.849 --> 26:19.583
a bit of an idiot.

26:19.584 --> 26:21.585
No. Why-why? No. Not at all.

26:21.586 --> 26:23.487
I...

26:23.488 --> 26:25.622
I just alienated myself
with my new co-workers.

26:25.623 --> 26:28.225
I basically called them callous monsters.

26:28.226 --> 26:29.493
- So, you know...
- Wow.

26:29.494 --> 26:32.696
- Yeah. I'm the idiot today, so...
- Wow.

26:34.198 --> 26:37.567
And an even bigger idiot for
telling my boss's daughter.

26:38.536 --> 26:40.303
It's okay.

26:43.707 --> 26:46.009
Um... it's work.

26:46.010 --> 26:48.078
Sorry. I got to run.

26:48.079 --> 26:52.249
But it was really nice to
run into you, Alexander.

26:52.250 --> 26:54.784
You, too, Stephanie-Stevie.

26:54.785 --> 26:56.887
Now I will remember.

26:56.888 --> 26:58.788
Right. See you.

26:58.789 --> 27:01.056
See you.

27:02.492 --> 27:04.127
How dare you

27:04.128 --> 27:05.962
make these demands while your troops

27:05.963 --> 27:07.464
continue to besiege Mabruk?

27:07.465 --> 27:08.698
That oil belongs to Libyan people

27:08.699 --> 27:10.200
who are oppressed and ignored

27:10.201 --> 27:12.602
- by your so-called government in Tripoli.
- Gentlemen, let's keep

27:12.603 --> 27:14.137
our focus on the _

27:14.138 --> 27:15.338
presidential council. _

27:15.339 --> 27:17.640
Please...

27:18.608 --> 27:20.243
Excuse me, ma'am. It's Nadine.

27:22.280 --> 27:23.446
How is she, Nadine?

27:23.447 --> 27:26.449
Aya's brain is swelling very badly

27:26.450 --> 27:30.053
and there's nothing they
can do here to stop it.

27:32.156 --> 27:33.323
Wait, what?

27:33.324 --> 27:36.426
The only hope they have
of reducing the swelling

27:36.427 --> 27:39.329
is with an external ventricular drain,

27:39.330 --> 27:42.098
which they don't have
here at the hospital.

27:42.099 --> 27:44.301
So we need to get her
someplace that does.

27:44.302 --> 27:45.602
Yes, ma'am.

27:45.603 --> 27:49.039
The closest medical facility with an EVD

27:49.040 --> 27:51.975
is the USNS Mercy hospital ship

27:51.976 --> 27:54.511
a few hundred miles away
in the Mediterranean.

27:54.512 --> 27:56.446
Now, time is of the essence,

27:56.447 --> 27:58.448
and with the no-fly zone,

27:58.449 --> 28:01.017
logistics become problematic.

28:01.018 --> 28:02.719
Thank you, Nadine.

28:02.720 --> 28:04.087
We are getting

28:04.088 --> 28:06.689
Aya Alsnany on that ship.

28:10.516 --> 28:11.823
_

28:11.932 --> 28:12.961
_

28:12.962 --> 28:14.158
_

28:14.331 --> 28:16.199
- Absolutely not.
- Ted...

28:16.200 --> 28:18.902
Ma'am, LNC affiliates shot
down a UN peacekeeper helicopter

28:18.903 --> 28:21.271
- in that same airspace not two weeks ago.
- Yes, I know.

28:21.272 --> 28:24.140
So maybe we find another route

28:24.141 --> 28:26.409
- that NAVAIR will sign off on.
- Find another route?

28:26.410 --> 28:28.778
I wouldn't even know where to begin.

28:28.779 --> 28:31.414
There has to be a way. Hey, maybe...

28:31.415 --> 28:33.550
I don't know. Just...

28:33.551 --> 28:35.785
- think outside the box, please.
- Ma'am, we all want that girl

28:35.786 --> 28:37.654
to pull through, but
even if I were willing

28:37.655 --> 28:40.290
to push the envelope,
the Pentagon is not gonna

28:40.291 --> 28:43.260
put a flight crew at
risk in hostile territory.

28:43.261 --> 28:45.627
Even the president won't
overrule them on this.

28:47.597 --> 28:49.865
I can't let her die.

28:54.191 --> 28:57.761
Thank you for gathering again.

28:57.762 --> 29:00.405
We appreciate your
offer to help integrate

29:00.406 --> 29:02.574
our two militaries, and your aid package

29:02.575 --> 29:04.509
is more than generous.

29:04.510 --> 29:06.211
But your help is meaningless

29:06.212 --> 29:08.580
- if our opponents continue to extort us.
- It's fine.

29:08.581 --> 29:11.215
I'm done negotiating.

29:11.883 --> 29:13.685
I sense another

29:13.686 --> 29:16.054
- American trick.
- Uh...

29:16.055 --> 29:18.991
No, I-I...

29:18.992 --> 29:22.394
I asked you to come back because...

29:22.395 --> 29:25.230
there is something that
we can solve together.

29:25.231 --> 29:28.800
On our way from the airport yesterday,

29:28.801 --> 29:31.503
my motorcade hit a little
girl in Castelverde,

29:31.504 --> 29:32.938
and right now she is

29:32.939 --> 29:36.008
at Ehtuish Hospital with a
potentially fatal brain injury.

29:37.410 --> 29:41.179
So, another Libyan victim
of United States help.

29:41.180 --> 29:42.614
Yeah. I get that.

29:42.615 --> 29:44.449
And we can debate the morality

29:44.450 --> 29:46.852
of the 2011 NATO bombing campaign here

29:46.853 --> 29:49.187
another time, but right
now that girl needs...

29:49.188 --> 29:52.190
she needs life-saving care,

29:52.191 --> 29:55.327
and it is only available to her

29:55.328 --> 29:57.229
aboard a U.S. hospital ship

29:57.230 --> 29:59.998
off the coast of Al Khums.

29:59.999 --> 30:03.835
We can't get her there
because of the no-fly zone

30:03.836 --> 30:05.303
your militaries are enforcing.

30:05.304 --> 30:08.873
Once again, it is our fault.

30:11.877 --> 30:13.712
One hour.

30:13.713 --> 30:15.213
We just need

30:15.214 --> 30:18.449
a one-hour cease-fire and
suspension of the no-fly zone.

30:20.752 --> 30:23.789
The no-fly zone is the
only thing stopping them

30:23.790 --> 30:25.157
from dropping barrel bombs on us.

30:25.158 --> 30:26.725
We only agreed

30:26.726 --> 30:28.860
- to the talks...
- I'm asking you to focus

30:28.861 --> 30:31.295
on one little girl who
doesn't need to die today.

30:32.564 --> 30:34.899
We did nothing to this girl.

30:37.335 --> 30:39.670
No.

30:40.539 --> 30:43.675
But she will die if you do nothing now.

30:43.676 --> 30:47.345
Isn't it our most fundamental...

30:47.346 --> 30:50.382
responsibility to save innocent lives?

30:50.383 --> 30:52.516
I am begging you.

30:53.657 --> 30:54.827
_

30:58.136 --> 30:59.681
_

31:20.746 --> 31:22.546
In my office, please.

31:27.686 --> 31:30.722
They had no choice but
to tell me about your

31:30.723 --> 31:33.959
spectacularly troubling behavior.

31:33.960 --> 31:36.894
- Okay, I...
- Oh, no, no! Not okay.

31:38.029 --> 31:40.031
It's not okay.

31:40.032 --> 31:41.867
And it doesn't matter
that they were insensitive.

31:41.868 --> 31:43.268
I talked to them about that.

31:43.269 --> 31:46.505
This is about whether or not
you still have the temperament

31:46.506 --> 31:47.973
to do this kind of work.

31:47.974 --> 31:50.675
You know damn well that
any perceived weakness

31:50.676 --> 31:52.377
can be exploited by our enemies.

31:52.378 --> 31:54.146
- Yeah, I understand that.
- Then you need to instill

31:54.147 --> 31:56.882
a little more confidence that
you're working for the right side.

31:56.883 --> 31:58.984
Which was the central issue

31:58.985 --> 32:01.219
when I was putting all of
my credibility on the line

32:01.220 --> 32:03.088
to get you this work in the first place.

32:03.089 --> 32:05.422
Or maybe you don't get that.

32:06.691 --> 32:08.627
I get it.

32:08.628 --> 32:11.362
Everything that you have done for me.

32:13.231 --> 32:15.499
It won't happen again.

32:19.070 --> 32:21.839
You're gonna start
seeing Dr. Thorton again.

32:23.008 --> 32:24.509
Wait.

32:24.510 --> 32:26.077
In Phoenix?

32:26.078 --> 32:27.746
I'm having him come here.

32:27.747 --> 32:30.614
That's all.

32:40.358 --> 32:42.826
That's not all, Dr. McCord.

32:54.372 --> 32:56.074
For the last ten months

32:56.075 --> 32:58.710
I have been struggling
with opiate addiction.

32:58.711 --> 33:01.079
Um, yeah, mostly oxycodone.

33:02.348 --> 33:06.084
Uh, the doctors gave
me oxy for my injuries

33:06.085 --> 33:08.553
after my release from Russia.

33:08.554 --> 33:11.456
And when, uh, when I got
out of the hospital...

33:11.457 --> 33:13.525
they weaned me off the drugs,

33:13.526 --> 33:15.260
but, um...

33:15.261 --> 33:17.729
I still had... had pain.

33:17.730 --> 33:20.665
So...

33:20.666 --> 33:24.336
I found it myself on the street, and...

33:24.337 --> 33:26.638
um...

33:26.639 --> 33:28.306
at some point, uh,

33:28.307 --> 33:30.075
it-it stopped being about the pain...

33:30.076 --> 33:32.209
I just needed it.

33:33.979 --> 33:36.248
And now I can't stop.

33:41.386 --> 33:45.322
Um... I even lied to my sister.

33:49.261 --> 33:51.930
Um, I-I know... I know how bad this is,

33:51.931 --> 33:53.765
and, uh...

33:53.766 --> 33:56.333
how much it compromises me.

33:58.536 --> 34:01.038
I'm so sorry.

34:19.757 --> 34:22.259
Not bad, eh?

34:23.328 --> 34:25.130
Not at all.

34:25.130 --> 34:27.998
I thought if coming up
with a theory of everything

34:28.000 --> 34:31.835
doesn't work... we've got house painting.

34:32.637 --> 34:34.773
You didn't have to finish.

34:34.774 --> 34:36.308
I know.

34:36.309 --> 34:40.145
I just realized what... an
idiot I'd been last night,

34:40.146 --> 34:43.114
and since you were off to
work, the only penance available

34:43.114 --> 34:47.251
was to finish the one thing
I'd so rudely railed against.

34:48.520 --> 34:52.056
I don't think that our fight
was just about painting.

34:52.058 --> 34:54.960
I adore your family,
and I admire your work.

34:54.960 --> 34:57.629
- You don't have to...
- I do, I do. The truth is,

34:57.630 --> 35:00.265
I... I brag about your mum.

35:00.266 --> 35:01.466
Mom.

35:01.467 --> 35:02.901
God.

35:02.902 --> 35:05.804
And the fact that you work
at the epicenter of power

35:05.805 --> 35:07.739
for the whole damn world...

35:07.740 --> 35:12.010
- As an intern.
- As an anything is impressive and amazing.

35:12.011 --> 35:13.812
Maybe I'm a bit intimidated.

35:13.813 --> 35:16.581
- Jareth...
- No, no, no.

35:16.582 --> 35:20.352
I'm sorry that I was
such a cretin last night.

35:20.353 --> 35:23.088
And I know I don't deserve it.

35:23.089 --> 35:24.923
Forgive me.

35:24.924 --> 35:26.891
Of course.

35:26.892 --> 35:30.095
I love you, Stephanie McCord,
and, if it's not too creepy...

35:30.096 --> 35:32.364
I think I love your mum, too.

35:32.365 --> 35:35.065
It's a little creepy.

35:38.536 --> 35:41.138
I love you, too.

35:54.587 --> 35:56.087
Nadine, what's happening?

35:56.088 --> 36:00.325
Mr. Alsnany has changed his
mind about the helicopter.

36:00.326 --> 36:02.527
Well, does he understand she'll...?

36:02.528 --> 36:05.463
He's... he's never been on an airplane,

36:05.464 --> 36:07.032
let alone a helicopter.

36:07.033 --> 36:09.434
He's frightened, ma'am.

36:09.435 --> 36:11.970
Mr. Alsnany?

36:11.971 --> 36:13.405
Mrs. Alsnany?

36:13.406 --> 36:15.040
I'm Elizabeth McCord.

36:15.041 --> 36:18.443
I am so deeply sorry about
what's happened to Aya,

36:18.444 --> 36:20.612
but she needs to get to the hospital.

36:20.613 --> 36:21.679
Now, I understand

36:21.680 --> 36:23.715
there's a problem with the helicopter?

36:23.716 --> 36:25.688
We are not going.

36:25.767 --> 36:28.306
How do we know we will
not be shot down? _

36:28.554 --> 36:30.121
I have heard many stories. _

36:30.122 --> 36:32.323
That was before the cease-fire, okay?

36:32.324 --> 36:36.194
Both sides have agreed to let
this helicopter fly safely.

36:36.195 --> 36:38.195
I have their personal assurance.

36:39.013 --> 36:40.899
You do, _

36:40.900 --> 36:43.034
but how do we know?

36:43.035 --> 36:44.402
Because I'll go with you.

36:44.403 --> 36:46.504
Oh, ma'am, ma'am, this
needs to be run by DoD.

36:46.505 --> 36:48.940
Ted, you and I both know
there's no time for that.

36:48.941 --> 36:50.341
It's not gonna happen.
Ma'am, a medevac helicopter

36:50.342 --> 36:52.110
is one thing, but with...
The clock is running down

36:52.111 --> 36:54.345
- on the cease-fire... she has to get to
the hospital. - Ma'am, I am authorized

36:54.346 --> 36:56.972
to physically stop you...
you are aware of that, right?

36:56.973 --> 36:58.216
I know. Yes.

36:58.217 --> 37:01.252
Just... come on, Ted.

37:01.253 --> 37:04.589
Let's take a little ride,
save this girl. Please?

37:05.858 --> 37:08.792
- You're killing me, ma'am.
- I know.

37:10.361 --> 37:13.131
Mr. Alsnany... It's okay? Yes?

37:13.132 --> 37:14.899
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

37:33.485 --> 37:36.386
Okay, come, come.

37:41.595 --> 37:43.137
_

37:47.408 --> 37:49.776
It's taking so long.

37:49.777 --> 37:52.612
The doctor said it could
take up to five hours.

38:00.587 --> 38:02.822
...Elizabeth?

38:02.823 --> 38:04.924
Do you have children?

38:04.925 --> 38:06.025
Yes.

38:06.026 --> 38:08.161
They're... grown now.

38:12.400 --> 38:14.533
How old?

38:15.535 --> 38:19.105
Our daughters, uh, Stevie and Alison

38:19.106 --> 38:22.041
are 22 and 18 years old, and...

38:22.042 --> 38:24.043
our son Jason

38:24.044 --> 38:26.411
is 16.

38:32.919 --> 38:35.554
We also have two girls and a boy.

38:36.689 --> 38:40.359
Eisha is 13, and our son Khaled is 11.

38:42.663 --> 38:44.730
Aya is the youngest.

39:05.084 --> 39:06.653
She's gonna be okay.

39:06.654 --> 39:08.788
The operation was a complete success.

39:13.327 --> 39:14.894
Your little Aya... she is a fighter.

39:14.895 --> 39:17.130
She responded beautifully to the EVD,

39:17.131 --> 39:18.198
and the brain swelling

39:18.199 --> 39:19.566
is already going down.

39:19.567 --> 39:21.134
She's in recovery right now

39:21.135 --> 39:23.069
under heavy sedation, but, uh...

39:23.070 --> 39:25.538
if you want, you can come be with her.

39:36.086 --> 39:36.985
_

39:43.623 --> 39:45.525
Ma'am, there's a chopper
waiting to take you

39:45.526 --> 39:47.694
to Aviano Air Base.

39:47.695 --> 39:48.795
Madam Secretary.

39:48.796 --> 39:50.864
Ma'am. Ma'am, s...

39:50.865 --> 39:52.565
something amazing happened.

39:52.566 --> 39:54.067
I see that.

39:54.068 --> 39:55.668
The cease-fire... it held.

39:55.669 --> 39:59.072
Well, that's good.
That's... And not just that.

39:59.073 --> 40:00.807
Now they want you to come back.

40:00.808 --> 40:02.942
To Tripoli? Why?

40:02.943 --> 40:06.279
Well... both sides agreed
on a presidential council,

40:06.280 --> 40:08.548
which clears the way for
an integrated military

40:08.549 --> 40:10.250
and oil revenue sharing.

40:10.251 --> 40:13.286
Ma'am, they want to sign the peace deal.

40:13.287 --> 40:14.454
What?

40:14.455 --> 40:16.022
- Are you...?
- Yeah. Apparently, they started

40:16.023 --> 40:17.357
negotiating again as soon as we left.

40:17.358 --> 40:19.358
They were moved by your plea to save Aya.

40:20.126 --> 40:22.529
It's so... just amazing.

40:22.530 --> 40:23.997
- That's...
- Wow.

40:23.998 --> 40:25.565
- Right?
- A freakin' miracle.

40:25.566 --> 40:26.666
Yeah.

40:26.667 --> 40:28.567
Aw, Ted's gonna love this.

40:32.105 --> 40:33.273
Ted?

40:33.274 --> 40:35.073
Ma'am?

40:40.246 --> 40:42.482
...having a hard time with the drips.

40:42.483 --> 40:45.387
Hey! You're home!

40:45.388 --> 40:47.020
- Hey, babe.
- Hi, honey.

40:47.021 --> 40:49.122
- Oh-ho! Hi.
- Hi.

40:49.123 --> 40:50.557
Darling.

40:50.558 --> 40:51.991
Oh.

40:51.992 --> 40:54.961
I'm really glad that everything
worked out in Libya, Mom.

40:54.962 --> 40:56.362
Yes. Thank you.

40:56.363 --> 40:57.764
Uh, Russell mentioned

40:57.765 --> 40:59.732
that he read you in on it.

40:59.733 --> 41:01.034
Yeah.

41:01.035 --> 41:03.069
Breaking it gently is not his gift.

41:03.070 --> 41:03.993
Hey, how'd things work out

41:03.994 --> 41:06.702
with the, uh, Nantucket
Mist at Jareth's house?

41:06.703 --> 41:08.379
- Oh, yeah.
- Oh, great.

41:08.380 --> 41:09.914
Yeah, we both... love it.

41:09.915 --> 41:11.349
Thank you, again.

41:11.350 --> 41:13.184
You're welcome.

41:13.185 --> 41:14.685
Oh, uh...

41:14.686 --> 41:16.554
Dad, I-I ran into that guy

41:16.555 --> 41:18.990
that you work with at the War College.

41:18.991 --> 41:21.159
Um, Alexander.

41:21.160 --> 41:23.027
Oh, yeah, where was that?

41:23.028 --> 41:25.396
A convenience store in Adams Morgan.

41:25.397 --> 41:28.132
What'd he have to say for himself?

41:28.133 --> 41:29.600
Not much.

41:29.601 --> 41:31.636
He, um, he seems like a nice guy.

41:31.637 --> 41:32.904
Yeah, he is.

41:32.905 --> 41:35.206
Okay, what-what are, are you doing?

41:35.207 --> 41:37.875
- What do you mean?
- Well, you're, like, jamming the roller

41:37.876 --> 41:39.977
when you should be using a-a brush.

41:39.978 --> 41:42.446
Are you really gonna,
uh, criticize my painting?

41:42.447 --> 41:44.649
Are you really gonna
get defensive about it?

41:44.650 --> 41:46.817
O-Okay, give me a brush.

41:46.818 --> 41:48.186
- Don't get all huffy.
- No. Here...

41:48.187 --> 41:49.954
- I don't know where they are.
- What? What?

41:49.955 --> 41:52.823
Look, I'm doing it your
way, babe. Let it go.

41:52.824 --> 41:54.592
Good night.

41:54.593 --> 41:56.460
Feels like you need to let it go.

41:56.461 --> 41:58.561
- Really?
- Yeah, r...

41:59.230 --> 42:01.232
Oh, no. No, no. Don't do it.

42:01.233 --> 42:03.834
You do not want to get in a
paint fight with me. You don't.

42:03.835 --> 42:05.236
Or maybe I do.

42:05.237 --> 42:06.404
D...

42:06.405 --> 42:07.638
Oh...

42:07.639 --> 42:09.574
- that looks... that looks good.
- Oh, oh, does it?

42:09.575 --> 42:11.842
- Yes.
- Does it look good? Ho-ho-ho!

42:11.843 --> 42:13.911
Look at that, you got right in...

42:13.912 --> 42:15.379
- Oh, you think that's gonna work?
- Come on.

42:15.380 --> 42:16.447
Think that's gonna work?

42:16.448 --> 42:17.448
Oh!

42:17.449 --> 42:18.583
Direct hit.

42:18.584 --> 42:20.184
- Okay. Okay.
- Bam!

42:20.185 --> 42:21.586
Okay, fine.

42:21.587 --> 42:23.521
- Come on.
- Okay, okay, but I like my shirt.

42:23.522 --> 42:25.356
- Come on. Oh, you do?
- This is one of my favorite shirts.

42:25.357 --> 42:26.991
- How much do you like it? How much do
you like it? - Don't do it. Don't do it.

42:26.992 --> 42:29.727
- How much do you like it?
- I like you so much. I like you so much.

42:29.728 --> 42:32.630
Oh! Henry, I can't see...
those are my glasses!

42:32.631 --> 42:33.564
That's...

42:33.565 --> 42:34.599
- Oh!
- Oh!

42:34.600 --> 42:36.500
You like it? You like it? Whoo-hoo!

42:36.501 --> 42:38.502
- Oh, go for it. Come on.
- Let me just tell you something.

42:38.503 --> 42:39.804
- Come on.
- You know what? I... That is my nipple.

42:39.805 --> 42:41.505
Hit me with your best shot.

42:41.506 --> 42:42.940
Oh-ho-ho! No, no.

42:42.941 --> 42:44.241
Not below the belt. Not... Oh!
