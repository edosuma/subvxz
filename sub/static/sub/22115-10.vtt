00:02.336 --> 00:05.506
Hi, I'm Jeffrey Tanner.
Welcome to Sophe.

00:05.539 --> 00:08.176
We all know the Internet
changed the world.

00:08.209 --> 00:10.244
The only question is:
into what?

00:10.278 --> 00:11.512
It can be a platform
to bring us together

00:11.545 --> 00:13.281
or to tear us apart.

00:13.314 --> 00:14.615
I know, because I spent my life

00:14.648 --> 00:16.517
trying to turn it
into something

00:16.550 --> 00:18.786
that would connect us all.
Then...

00:18.819 --> 00:20.821
I love you, Dad.
...my daughter was murdered.

00:20.854 --> 00:22.523
Nothing else mattered anymore.

00:22.556 --> 00:24.592
Everyone was sure
they knew who did it--

00:24.625 --> 00:26.394
the police, my ex-wife--

00:26.427 --> 00:28.262
but I was convinced the
wrong man had been convicted

00:28.296 --> 00:30.198
and the real killer
was still out there.

00:30.231 --> 00:32.200
So together with my team,
I built Sophe,

00:32.233 --> 00:34.535
a crowdsource
crime solving platform

00:34.568 --> 00:37.405
powered by the smartest,
most diverse,

00:37.438 --> 00:40.274
independent collection of
detectives on the planet:

00:40.308 --> 00:42.810
you.

00:42.843 --> 00:44.845
Let's get to work.

00:44.878 --> 00:46.647
Previously on
Wisdom of the Crowd...

00:46.680 --> 00:48.582
Nell DeGraf sent
a cease and desist.

00:48.616 --> 00:50.518
Claiming Sophe's
running codes

00:50.551 --> 00:51.852
stolen from AllSourcer.

00:51.885 --> 00:53.454
It's not really about
the code anymore.

00:53.487 --> 00:54.388
They're coming after you.

00:54.422 --> 00:55.623
Make nice with Nell.

00:55.656 --> 00:57.225
TANNER:
And give her a stake in Sophe?

00:57.258 --> 00:59.360
No.
Some guy comes in here

00:59.393 --> 01:01.295
in a suit,
claiming to be my lawyer.

01:01.329 --> 01:04.132
All I got to do is keep
an eye out on this new fish.

01:04.165 --> 01:05.133
Ochoa, he's telling someone
else on the phone

01:05.166 --> 01:06.400
that he might know
who killed her.

01:06.434 --> 01:08.136
So I stuck him.

01:08.169 --> 01:11.539
Flaco's lawyer wasn't too
careful with the cameras.

01:11.572 --> 01:13.607
Someone out there has to know
something about this guy.

01:16.610 --> 01:18.846
SARA (echoing):
Isn't this adorable?

01:18.879 --> 01:21.315
Josh?
(snores softly)

01:21.349 --> 01:22.616
Josh.
Huh?

01:24.518 --> 01:26.854
Coffee.

01:26.887 --> 01:30.658
My God, why don't either of you
have a life?

01:30.691 --> 01:31.859
Uh, Tanner?

01:31.892 --> 01:33.194
TARIQ:
We were about to leave,

01:33.227 --> 01:34.662
and then a wave of posts came in

01:34.695 --> 01:36.197
about the guy
who paid Flaco

01:36.230 --> 01:38.432
to shiv Carlos
Ochoa in prison.

01:38.466 --> 01:40.434
Tanner was on the warpath
trying to track 'em down, so...

01:40.468 --> 01:43.204
Users thought
he was a cartel boss

01:43.237 --> 01:44.538
who escaped from Mexican prison
last year.

01:44.572 --> 01:46.540
That didn't pan out,

01:46.574 --> 01:48.376
so we still have no clue
who this dude is.

01:48.409 --> 01:50.110
Or his connections
to Mia's case.

01:51.312 --> 01:52.580
Hmm.
Oh, thank you.

01:52.613 --> 01:53.681
Thank you.

01:53.714 --> 01:56.484
Dude.
What? I only
have two hands.

01:56.517 --> 01:58.219
Um, look, we've still
got a few more

01:58.252 --> 01:59.887
leads to run down.
We'll keep at it.

01:59.920 --> 02:02.390
No, no, you won't.
You need to get some rest.

02:02.423 --> 02:04.525
Use my office. That's an order.

02:04.558 --> 02:06.727
I call the big couch.
Come on, insult to injury?

02:15.236 --> 02:16.304
Any word?

02:16.337 --> 02:17.605
Actually, yes.

02:17.638 --> 02:19.173
I just got off the phone
with the lawyers.

02:19.207 --> 02:21.275
Based on what came out
of the depositions,

02:21.309 --> 02:23.477
AllSourcer's dropping their
claim that we stole their code.

02:23.511 --> 02:26.214
Oh, thank God.
Unfortunately,

02:26.247 --> 02:27.515
they're not dropping
their claim for you.

02:27.548 --> 02:28.582
They're still
saying that you

02:28.616 --> 02:29.450
violated your
noncompete.

02:29.483 --> 02:30.918
Now, a judge

02:30.951 --> 02:32.520
should have a ruling on
the preliminary injunction

02:32.553 --> 02:34.255
in the next 24 hours.

02:34.288 --> 02:36.257
Okay, well, if the judge
does rule against us,

02:36.290 --> 02:37.658
what happens next?

02:37.691 --> 02:40.394
You'll have to stop work,
immediately.

02:40.428 --> 02:42.263
And it won't be
like last time.

02:42.296 --> 02:43.731
This time, there won't
be any coming back,

02:43.764 --> 02:45.533
at least not until
after the trial.

02:45.566 --> 02:48.336
But it could take a year
to get to trial, or longer.

02:48.369 --> 02:50.238
Yes, but...

02:50.271 --> 02:52.706
let's not get ahead
of ourselves, okay?

02:52.740 --> 02:54.375
Have you told Jeffrey?

02:54.408 --> 02:56.777
Yeah, he didn't
take it very well.

02:58.379 --> 02:59.647
Had a feeling I might be
hearing from you, Jeffrey.

02:59.680 --> 03:00.681
Well, I was in the neighborhood

03:00.714 --> 03:02.416
and I thought that
we could chat.

03:02.450 --> 03:05.286
Wow, you have really
made this place your own

03:05.319 --> 03:06.687
since you've taken over.

03:06.720 --> 03:09.557
It's like every IKEA
I've ever been in.

03:09.590 --> 03:12.293
Oh, well, I know how difficult
change can be, Jeffrey.

03:12.326 --> 03:13.961
But it is the one constant
in life, isn't it?

03:13.994 --> 03:15.596
Gizmo, down.
(snaps fingers, Gizmo whines)

03:16.597 --> 03:18.966
(whines)
Anyway,

03:18.999 --> 03:20.801
like I said, thought
you might reach out,

03:20.834 --> 03:23.471
so I took the liberty
of preparing an offer.

03:23.504 --> 03:25.539
An excellent one, in fact.

03:25.573 --> 03:27.275
I still want
a stake in Sophe,

03:27.308 --> 03:29.777
but I'm not unreasonable
about the size of it.

03:29.810 --> 03:33.447
Frankly, I'm tired of all the
wasted time, the legal bills...

03:33.481 --> 03:35.316
Or maybe you're just nervous
that the judge is gonna

03:35.349 --> 03:37.585
throw the case out, and you
want to cut your losses.

03:39.420 --> 03:40.988
Take the offer, Jeffrey.

03:41.021 --> 03:42.456
That way Sara can stay at Sophe,

03:42.490 --> 03:43.724
and everyone gets
what they want.

03:43.757 --> 03:45.259
You remember when we first
talked about this,

03:45.293 --> 03:47.461
you know what I said to you?
I told you

03:47.495 --> 03:49.597
that I would never give
you a stake in Sophe.

03:49.630 --> 03:52.333
Nothing's changed.
Forgive me, but I was

03:52.366 --> 03:54.635
under the impression that Sara
meant a great deal to you

03:54.668 --> 03:56.270
and your company.
I'm giving you the chance

03:56.304 --> 03:58.339
to save her.
From a problem

03:58.372 --> 04:01.309
that you created. Look,
you want to monetize Sophe.

04:01.342 --> 04:04.578
The day that happens is
the day that our users

04:04.612 --> 04:07.781
abandon the platform. And I
can't allow that to happen.

04:07.815 --> 04:09.350
If you didn't want to
settle this, Jeffrey,

04:09.383 --> 04:10.651
then why the hell
did you come here?

04:10.684 --> 04:12.486
Because I wanted to
clarify my position.

04:12.520 --> 04:13.754
Up until now,

04:13.787 --> 04:15.489
I let the lawyers
handle everything

04:15.523 --> 04:18.759
because... who has the time?

04:18.792 --> 04:20.794
But now, I'm gonna
make the time.

04:20.828 --> 04:23.397
Now I'm gonna make
sure that you regret

04:23.431 --> 04:26.667
the moment that you
decided to cross me.

04:26.700 --> 04:28.602
This is beneath you.
It is.

04:28.636 --> 04:31.372
So what? Drop the suit.

04:31.405 --> 04:32.773
Because if you don't,

04:32.806 --> 04:35.643
I don't care how long it takes.

04:35.676 --> 04:38.746
I don't care if it ruins me
in the process,

04:38.779 --> 04:40.881
I'm gonna destroy you.

04:40.914 --> 04:42.416
And this company.

04:42.450 --> 04:43.684
(ripping paper)

04:47.355 --> 04:48.656
Have a nice day.

04:48.689 --> 04:50.424
(growls)

04:53.494 --> 04:54.495
DAWN LEE:
Are you ready?

04:54.528 --> 04:56.630
'Cause I sure am.

04:59.132 --> 05:01.669
(gasps)

05:01.702 --> 05:04.071
Ooh, right.

05:04.104 --> 05:05.539
(sniffs)

05:05.573 --> 05:08.676
Now watch me eat it.

05:08.709 --> 05:11.111
Mmm.

05:11.144 --> 05:15.115
Mmm, it tastes so good.

05:15.148 --> 05:17.418
Mmm.

05:17.451 --> 05:20.688
I bet you want to try some,
don't you?

05:20.721 --> 05:23.557
(knocking at door)

05:23.591 --> 05:25.526
Coming!

05:27.928 --> 05:29.463
(door opens)

05:29.497 --> 05:30.764
DAWN LEE:
What do you do-- no, no!

05:30.798 --> 05:31.632
(gunshot)
(Dawn Lee screaming)

05:31.665 --> 05:33.501
(body thuds on floor)

05:33.534 --> 05:36.404
(gunshot)

05:36.437 --> 05:37.871
CAVANAUGH:
She was filming herself?

05:37.905 --> 05:39.407
Are you kidding me?

05:39.440 --> 05:41.108
Dawn Lee, 23.

05:41.141 --> 05:43.511
She's one of those
AllSourcer celebrities.

05:43.544 --> 05:44.545
She's a what?

05:44.578 --> 05:45.879
You know,
one of those people

05:45.913 --> 05:47.581
that makes weird videos
of themselves

05:47.615 --> 05:49.750
and get millions of views
and all that endorsement money.

05:49.783 --> 05:51.552
Okay, if you say so.

05:51.585 --> 05:53.487
RUIZ: Apparently, people
all over the planet

05:53.521 --> 05:54.622
like to watch Dawn eat.

05:56.990 --> 06:00.127
What is this world coming to?

06:00.160 --> 06:02.596
So it's too bad the girl
didn't film her own murder.

06:02.630 --> 06:04.465
Might've been worthwhile.

06:04.498 --> 06:06.634
She didn't,
but the killer did.

06:06.667 --> 06:07.601
I'm sorry, what?
Yep.

06:07.635 --> 06:08.869
Posted it
about an hour ago.

06:08.902 --> 06:10.471
(door opens)

06:10.504 --> 06:12.606
DAWN LEE:
What are you do-- no, no! No!

06:12.640 --> 06:14.608
(gunshots)
(Dawn Lee screaming)

06:14.642 --> 06:16.877
(gunshot)
And the killer

06:16.910 --> 06:18.746
just posted the video
to AllSourcer, too.

06:18.779 --> 06:20.548
That's Tanner's old company.
Exactly.

06:20.581 --> 06:23.617
So right now all we have is
a username: "EchoAvenger98."

06:23.651 --> 06:24.985
But we need the killer's
account information.

06:25.018 --> 06:26.720
Do you think Tanner can
cut through the red tape?

06:26.754 --> 06:27.821
I'm on it.

06:33.894 --> 06:35.429
Sorry, am I in the wrong office?

06:35.463 --> 06:37.665
Okay.

06:37.698 --> 06:39.467
I take it you already heard?
She made you a
really good offer.

06:39.500 --> 06:40.901
You should've considered it.

06:40.934 --> 06:43.471
No deals.
No negotiations, all right?

06:43.504 --> 06:45.506
We take the fight to them.
(coffee pours)

06:45.539 --> 06:46.674
File a countersuit.

06:46.707 --> 06:48.509
For what?

06:48.542 --> 06:49.743
I don't know.
Come on, you're a lawyer.

06:49.777 --> 06:50.811
Figure it out.

06:51.945 --> 06:53.447
Did you tell Sara?

06:53.481 --> 06:54.748
About what,

06:54.782 --> 06:55.749
that you could've negotiated

06:55.783 --> 06:56.950
to keep her here at Sophe,

06:56.984 --> 06:58.819
but you chose not to

06:58.852 --> 07:00.454
out of--
what was it?

07:00.488 --> 07:01.789
Was it spite?

07:01.822 --> 07:03.190
No, I figured that was better
coming from you.

07:03.223 --> 07:04.291
It's not that simple.

07:04.324 --> 07:06.794
Nell would destroy everything
that we built here.

07:06.827 --> 07:08.028
This is about

07:08.061 --> 07:09.697
what's best for Sophe,

07:09.730 --> 07:12.232
for solving Mia's murder.

07:12.265 --> 07:14.802
Then I'm sure she'll understand.

07:14.835 --> 07:16.870
CAVANAUGH:
Sorry to interrupt,

07:16.904 --> 07:18.739
but I need your help.
It's urgent.

07:19.973 --> 07:21.742
What are you do-- no, no!

07:21.775 --> 07:24.745
(gunshots)
No! (screaming)

07:24.778 --> 07:28.982
(panting)

07:29.016 --> 07:30.718
(sighs)

07:30.751 --> 07:32.920
So do we post this?

07:32.953 --> 07:34.655
Unless there's an excellent
reason, I don't see why

07:34.688 --> 07:35.789
we subject anyone else to this.

07:35.823 --> 07:37.224
TARIQ:
Tell that to AllSourcer.

07:37.257 --> 07:38.492
They still haven't deactivated

07:38.526 --> 07:39.693
the killer's account.

07:39.727 --> 07:41.061
The video's got
millions of views.

07:41.094 --> 07:42.930
TANNER: We're not gonna
add to those figures.

07:42.963 --> 07:44.732
Post it, but without this video.

07:44.765 --> 07:45.866
(phone chimes)

07:45.899 --> 07:47.868
(Josh typing)

07:47.901 --> 07:48.936
And we're live.

07:48.969 --> 07:52.272
Amazingly, I still have
some friends at AllSourcer.

07:52.305 --> 07:54.675
They're sending us the metadata
on the killer's account.

07:54.708 --> 07:56.944
Thanks.
No need to thank me.

07:56.977 --> 07:59.246
I want this son of a bitch
as badly as you do.

07:59.279 --> 08:00.648
That's my platform he's using.

08:00.681 --> 08:02.650
Not for nothing,
but there are...

08:02.683 --> 08:04.585
other ways to get
the account info.

08:04.618 --> 08:06.754
You do see me standing
right here, right?

08:06.787 --> 08:09.757
We have enough legal headaches
over at AllSourcer.

08:09.790 --> 08:12.726
We don't need to add
hacking to the list.

08:12.760 --> 08:16.764
Guys, EchoAvenger98 just posted
another video to his account.

08:16.797 --> 08:17.998
But this one's
on Live Stream.

08:20.768 --> 08:22.570
Wait, this is
happening right now?

08:22.603 --> 08:23.571
Yes.

08:32.780 --> 08:34.615
Can I help you?

08:34.648 --> 08:36.550
Oh, g--
(gunshots)

08:38.018 --> 08:40.120
*

08:51.264 --> 08:52.633
The Live Stream murder
has more than four million views

08:52.666 --> 08:54.001
and counting.
I don't think I'll ever

08:54.034 --> 08:55.569
be able to get that
out of my head.

08:55.603 --> 08:56.336
What the hell is taking
AllSourcer so long

08:56.369 --> 08:58.338
to shut down this account?

08:58.371 --> 09:00.774
Nell DeGraf's managerial skills
on display once again.

09:00.808 --> 09:02.109
All right,
what do we got?

09:02.142 --> 09:03.210
Well, we posted
everything we have

09:03.243 --> 09:05.112
on the second victim,
Richard Padilla.

09:05.145 --> 09:06.580
He's an AllSourcer celebrity,
as well.

09:06.614 --> 09:08.649
You got to see this guy
in action.

09:08.682 --> 09:10.117
RICHARD:
Five pounds of hamburger meat.

09:10.150 --> 09:13.220
Question is, "Will It Flush?"

09:19.026 --> 09:20.260
Moment of truth, my friends.

09:20.293 --> 09:22.229
TANNER:
You know what?

09:22.262 --> 09:24.231
I-I think we've seen enough.
Actually, the best videos

09:24.264 --> 09:25.132
are the ones that
wouldn't go down.

09:25.165 --> 09:27.735
All right, uh,
Richard Padilla and Dawn Lee

09:27.768 --> 09:29.202
are two of the most popular
AllSourcer celebrities

09:29.236 --> 09:30.270
in the Bay Area.

09:30.303 --> 09:32.139
SARA:
Users are almost unanimous.

09:32.172 --> 09:33.607
They were both targeted

09:33.641 --> 09:35.308
because of their
Internet-celebrity status.

09:35.342 --> 09:37.144
Targeted by who?
I mean, who is this

09:37.177 --> 09:38.746
EchoAvenger98?
(evidence alert blaring)

09:38.779 --> 09:40.347
JOSH: Whoever he is,
he just posted something new

09:40.380 --> 09:41.749
to AllSourcer.

09:41.782 --> 09:43.083
It's some kind of manifesto.

09:43.116 --> 09:44.618
Oh, great.

09:44.652 --> 09:45.786
We could be dealing
with another Unabomber.

09:45.819 --> 09:46.820
Put it up.

09:46.854 --> 09:48.055
(computer chimes)

09:49.790 --> 09:52.292
"The Internet was built
on the backs of fools.

09:52.325 --> 09:54.862
"Fools who imagined they were
working to improve society.

09:54.895 --> 09:57.397
"But all we did was
create a vehicle

09:57.430 --> 09:59.166
"for mindless
self-glorification,

09:59.199 --> 10:03.170
an altar to the triumph of
our own toxic narcissism."

10:03.203 --> 10:04.404
JOSH: "Tweeting,
blogging, status updates.

10:04.437 --> 10:08.676
All of it has to end.
A statement must be made."

10:08.709 --> 10:10.177
So he's blaming
AllSourcer celebs

10:10.210 --> 10:11.812
for the downfall of society

10:11.845 --> 10:13.681
and using AllSourcer
to broadcast his crimes.

10:13.714 --> 10:16.416
Hypocrisy, anyone?

10:16.449 --> 10:17.284
Well, AllSourcer
has more Live Stream viewers

10:17.317 --> 10:19.653
than any other platform
in the world.

10:19.687 --> 10:21.655
If you want people watching,
this is the place.

10:21.689 --> 10:23.290
He's no Hemingway,

10:23.323 --> 10:25.092
but he does have
a certain flair.

10:25.125 --> 10:27.194
What are you thinking?

10:27.227 --> 10:30.798
That one of our users might
recognize these ideas. I mean,

10:30.831 --> 10:33.300
I'm guessing it's not the first
time that he's expressed them.

10:33.333 --> 10:35.803
JOSH: All right,
posting it now.

10:35.836 --> 10:37.671
(phone rings)

10:37.705 --> 10:38.839
Tell me you got something.

10:38.872 --> 10:41.842
How about a witness?

10:41.875 --> 10:44.311
The lady who lives upstairs
says she saw a man with a gun

10:44.344 --> 10:47.280
near Padilla's building
right before the murder.

10:47.314 --> 10:49.783
You should really pair her up
with a sketch artist, chief.

10:49.817 --> 10:51.384
CAVANAUGH: Well, thank you
for that suggestion, Tariq.

10:51.418 --> 10:54.087
Never would've thought of it
otherwise.

10:54.121 --> 10:54.788
(cell phone chimes)

10:54.822 --> 10:58.291
Nell DeGraf just got back to us.

10:58.325 --> 10:59.827
She's on her way in to talk.

10:59.860 --> 11:01.194
You're kidding.

11:01.228 --> 11:02.796
I'll be right there.

11:04.965 --> 11:06.333
NELL:
Let me assure you,

11:06.366 --> 11:08.135
AllSourcer has every
intention of providing

11:08.168 --> 11:09.269
our full cooperation.

11:09.302 --> 11:10.838
We're sending you the metadata

11:10.871 --> 11:11.839
from the killer's account
as we speak.

11:11.872 --> 11:13.240
That is appreciated.

11:13.273 --> 11:15.108
And the account has been
fully deactivated.

11:15.142 --> 11:16.376
TANNER:
It's about time.

11:16.409 --> 11:17.410
NELL: You created
Live Stream, Jeffrey.

11:17.444 --> 11:18.345
You know better than anyone

11:18.378 --> 11:20.347
the millions of videos
we have to monitor

11:20.380 --> 11:22.415
every day.
We responded

11:22.449 --> 11:23.917
as quickly as we could.

11:23.951 --> 11:26.219
How are you going to
prevent this nutjob

11:26.253 --> 11:27.487
from just opening up
another account

11:27.520 --> 11:28.856
and posting again?

11:28.889 --> 11:30.390
That's a work in progress.

11:30.423 --> 11:31.792
Clearly, your safeguards
weren't up to the task.

11:31.825 --> 11:32.860
No, no, no, our-our
safeguards worked.

11:32.893 --> 11:34.461
CAVANAUGH:
Okay, okay.

11:34.494 --> 11:36.764
Let's deal with today.
So what do we do now?

11:36.797 --> 11:39.166
TANNER: Well, it's pretty
simple from where I stand.

11:39.199 --> 11:40.300
You just have to offline
Live Stream...

11:40.333 --> 11:41.735
We're not gonna offline
Live Stream.

11:41.769 --> 11:43.170
...for the time being
and then we...

11:43.203 --> 11:44.938
You really are a piece
of work, you know that?

11:44.972 --> 11:46.406
This guy wants an audience.

11:46.439 --> 11:48.909
If we deny him that,
he is less likely to kill.

11:48.942 --> 11:51.411
It's in...
You're the one who gave him
an audience, Jeffrey.

11:51.444 --> 11:53.847
I'm just cleaning
up your mess.
You just don't
want to shut down

11:53.881 --> 11:55.448
your cash faucet, all right?

11:55.482 --> 11:57.450
Live Stream is your best source
of income.

11:57.484 --> 11:58.952
Blame me all you want.
This is not on me.

11:58.986 --> 11:59.953
This is on you.
CAVANAUGH:
Okay, okay, okay.

11:59.987 --> 12:01.388
Hey.
(claps hands)

12:01.421 --> 12:04.357
This was great,
but we're done now.

12:04.391 --> 12:05.859
Thank you.

12:05.893 --> 12:07.160
Yes, thank you for your help,
Ms. DeGraf.

12:07.194 --> 12:08.195
I will walk you out.

12:18.839 --> 12:20.507
Are you checking over
the safeguards?

12:20.540 --> 12:23.410
Yeah.

12:23.443 --> 12:24.945
They were good, Jeffrey.

12:24.978 --> 12:26.914
Josh and I reviewed them
already.

12:26.947 --> 12:28.381
This is not your fault.

12:28.415 --> 12:29.883
Sure it is.

12:29.917 --> 12:32.019
Look what
AllSourcer's become.

12:32.052 --> 12:34.421
It's a megaphone for people to
broadcast their worst selves.

12:34.454 --> 12:36.456
This is not what
the Internet

12:36.489 --> 12:38.258
was supposed to be.

12:38.291 --> 12:40.527
This-this guy, whoever he is,
he's crazy,

12:40.560 --> 12:42.362
but he's not entirely wrong.

12:42.395 --> 12:44.197
I understand where
he's coming from.

12:44.231 --> 12:47.400
And I had a hand in all this.

12:47.434 --> 12:48.936
I should've done better.

12:48.969 --> 12:51.304
You were the one
that told me

12:51.338 --> 12:53.506
we can't control what people do
with the things that we create.

12:53.540 --> 12:55.008
Remember?

12:55.042 --> 12:57.477
Dwelling on what you could

12:57.510 --> 13:01.815
or should have done,
it-it doesn't do us any good...

13:01.849 --> 13:04.451
especially when we have
other problems to deal with.

13:07.520 --> 13:09.022
I'm sorry. I...

13:09.056 --> 13:12.059
I was just,
I was wallowing.

13:12.092 --> 13:16.029
(sighs) Listen, you...
this lawsuit,

13:16.063 --> 13:17.564
you don't have to worry.

13:17.597 --> 13:19.499
I don't know what else to do.

13:19.532 --> 13:21.869
I know it sounds crazy,
but I'm-I'm tempted

13:21.902 --> 13:24.504
to call Nell
and-and talk to her,

13:24.537 --> 13:27.040
one human being to another,
see if we can find

13:27.074 --> 13:28.475
any kind of compromise
that we can reach.

13:28.508 --> 13:32.012
No, no, that's...

13:32.045 --> 13:33.914
that's not a good idea.

13:33.947 --> 13:35.983
Look, Sara...

13:36.016 --> 13:38.018
(knock on door)

13:41.388 --> 13:43.857
There's something
you need to see.

13:43.891 --> 13:45.859
NELL:
What's transpired is a tragedy,

13:45.893 --> 13:49.897
but we are reviewing the
safeguards that were instituted

13:49.930 --> 13:51.531
prior to my tenure.

13:51.564 --> 13:53.934
My time at AllSourcer
has been brief,

13:53.967 --> 13:58.438
but already it's clear that
significant mistakes were made.

13:58.471 --> 13:59.572
She's throwing you
under the bus.

14:02.442 --> 14:05.012
We dissected the metadata,
but it got us nowhere.

14:05.045 --> 14:06.613
The killer used Tor
to access his account.

14:06.646 --> 14:07.614
It's untraceable.

14:07.647 --> 14:09.382
TARIQ: What about that sketch
of the suspect?

14:09.416 --> 14:11.084
You should really get
a move on, Detective.

14:11.118 --> 14:14.087
I'll get right on that.

14:16.990 --> 14:19.092
Glad you took my advice.

14:19.126 --> 14:20.928
You're slow,
but you're learning.

14:20.961 --> 14:21.628
CAVANAUGH:
Yeah, well, lucky I have you

14:21.661 --> 14:22.629
as a teacher.

14:22.662 --> 14:23.931
Posting it now.

14:26.099 --> 14:27.901
Can you try
contributing for once

14:27.935 --> 14:29.102
instead of just cracking jokes?

14:29.136 --> 14:30.938
Whoa.

14:30.971 --> 14:33.640
Dude.

14:33.673 --> 14:36.509
Dude, chill.

14:36.543 --> 14:39.646
Dude, what is your deal?

14:39.679 --> 14:41.548
Josh, I was just
messing with him, man.

14:41.581 --> 14:43.083
No, that's the problem.

14:43.116 --> 14:44.651
Just leave me alone,
will you?
Okay.

14:44.684 --> 14:46.386
Is everything all right?
I don't know.

14:46.419 --> 14:48.155
You tell me. He just
freaked out on me

14:48.188 --> 14:50.057
and he was an ass
this morning, too.

14:52.692 --> 14:56.329
Oh. I get it.

14:56.363 --> 14:57.697
What?

14:57.730 --> 14:59.599
I think he's upset
that you might be leaving

14:59.632 --> 15:01.935
and he's just
taking it out on me.

15:01.969 --> 15:03.103
SARA:
Oh, Josh.

15:03.136 --> 15:04.104
That is really sweet.

15:05.105 --> 15:07.074
Fine, maybe.

15:07.107 --> 15:09.442
Okay, I'm sorry.
It's really immature, I know,

15:09.476 --> 15:11.611
but, I mean,
you brought me here.

15:11.644 --> 15:14.014
I-I don't know what
this place is without you.

15:14.047 --> 15:15.348
Okay, I'm not
insulted by that.

15:15.382 --> 15:18.018
Look, both of you,
whatever happens,

15:18.051 --> 15:20.153
it'll be fine
and-and you'll be fine.

15:20.187 --> 15:22.022
Okay?

15:22.055 --> 15:24.357
(evidence alert blaring)

15:24.391 --> 15:26.659
Come on.

15:26.693 --> 15:28.461
JOSH: It looks like there's
six different suspects.

15:28.495 --> 15:30.063
A subset of users found them
using forensic linguistics.

15:30.097 --> 15:33.000
The same way the FBI
got the Unabomber.
Yeah.

15:33.033 --> 15:34.667
Which is?
They identified
unique word choices

15:34.701 --> 15:37.604
and grammatical constructions
in his manifesto,

15:37.637 --> 15:39.973
then matched them to other
writings across the Internet.

15:40.007 --> 15:41.108
One more reason not to leave

15:41.141 --> 15:42.675
your digital fingerprints
on anything.

15:43.743 --> 15:46.546
Hold up.

15:46.579 --> 15:48.148
Let me pull up
the police sketch.

15:50.483 --> 15:52.452
All right, now imagine him
without the hat.

15:52.485 --> 15:53.453
Same nose, same chin.

15:55.722 --> 15:57.590
Whoa, that's Lucas King.

15:57.624 --> 15:59.092
The Lucas King?

15:59.126 --> 16:00.527
I guess I'm not
one of the cool kids.

16:00.560 --> 16:01.594
Who's Lucas King?

16:01.628 --> 16:03.530
He's, like, one of the
original Net visionaries.

16:03.563 --> 16:05.232
Yeah, he's a pioneer.

16:05.265 --> 16:06.666
Created one of the first
search engines, but couldn't

16:06.699 --> 16:08.668
figure out how to monetize it.

16:08.701 --> 16:10.237
SARA:
And then he just

16:10.270 --> 16:11.604
fell off the map.

16:11.638 --> 16:13.206
Yeah, psychological
issues, I heard.

16:13.240 --> 16:15.208
Shocker.
Well, it makes sense
if you think about it.

16:15.242 --> 16:17.544
His manifesto, he said, "We."
"All we did."

16:17.577 --> 16:21.214
He wasn't just
speaking generally.

16:21.248 --> 16:23.150
He was indicting himself.

16:23.183 --> 16:24.684
Then what are we waiting for?

16:24.717 --> 16:28.188
If he wants an indictment,
let's give it to him.

16:28.221 --> 16:29.756
Post it.

16:29.789 --> 16:32.525
(evidence alert beeping)

16:50.243 --> 16:52.712
So, you know who I am now.

16:52.745 --> 16:55.748
Likely,
you'll find me soon enough.

16:55.782 --> 16:58.518
But I have more work to do
before then.

16:58.551 --> 17:00.487
I want the world to know
that I take no joy

17:00.520 --> 17:04.057
in these actions, only sorrow.

17:04.091 --> 17:06.726
But for the good of all,

17:06.759 --> 17:09.729
they must continue.

17:18.171 --> 17:19.806
(sirens wailing)

17:22.842 --> 17:23.810
Back in the door.

17:25.645 --> 17:27.280
RUIZ:
SFPD, open up.

17:27.314 --> 17:28.415
We have a warrant.

17:31.651 --> 17:33.586
Wait, what's going on?

17:33.620 --> 17:35.088
What...?

17:35.122 --> 17:36.223
Hey, Lucas King.

17:36.256 --> 17:37.390
Is he here?

17:37.424 --> 17:38.458
No.
Is he here?

17:38.491 --> 17:39.426
No, he left last night!

17:41.428 --> 17:43.430
Oh, my God.
What did he do?

17:47.134 --> 17:49.602
Is it horrible to say
that I'm not surprised?

17:49.636 --> 17:52.472
Did Lucas ever talk about
doing something like this?

17:52.505 --> 17:54.541
No. I mean,
not to me, anyway.

17:54.574 --> 17:58.245
It's just lately, um,
he wasn't all there

17:58.278 --> 18:00.380
by any stretch
of the imagination.

18:00.413 --> 18:03.550
Do you have any idea
where your brother might be?

18:03.583 --> 18:08.288
We just weren't
talking much recently.

18:08.321 --> 18:10.157
He just holes himself up
in the garage.

18:10.190 --> 18:11.891
You know, spends
all day reading.

18:11.924 --> 18:14.661
I-I just knew
there was something wrong.

18:14.694 --> 18:17.430
But with Lucas, there was
always something wrong.

18:17.464 --> 18:19.232
Okay.

18:19.266 --> 18:21.134
Why'd you take him in?

18:21.168 --> 18:22.669
Who else would?

18:22.702 --> 18:25.638
Marie, his wife...

18:25.672 --> 18:27.174
didn't want
to talk to him anymore.

18:27.207 --> 18:29.542
And the past 15 years,

18:29.576 --> 18:31.611
it's just been one thing
after another.

18:31.644 --> 18:33.380
First, he loses his company,

18:33.413 --> 18:35.382
then he loses his teaching job,
then his house.

18:35.415 --> 18:36.616
I mean, it just wouldn't stop.

18:36.649 --> 18:39.652
He thought he was
gonna change the world,

18:39.686 --> 18:43.923
but instead,
the world just chewed him up.

18:43.956 --> 18:48.428
Patty, if you called him,
think he'd talk to you?

18:50.630 --> 18:52.499
(cell phone ringing)

19:05.678 --> 19:07.247
Hey.

19:08.415 --> 19:09.516
Lucas?

19:12.252 --> 19:14.354
Patty.

19:14.387 --> 19:15.588
Are you with the police?

19:16.989 --> 19:19.692
Never mind. Doesn't matter.

19:19.726 --> 19:21.428
Patty...

19:21.461 --> 19:25.398
I am sorry for putting you
through this.

19:28.235 --> 19:29.902
You're a good person.

19:29.936 --> 19:31.538
You deserve better.

19:31.571 --> 19:33.240
(whispering):
They can't track him.

19:33.273 --> 19:34.574
He's using a VoIP.

19:34.607 --> 19:37.244
You're a good person, too.

19:37.277 --> 19:39.546
Deep down, I know.

19:39.579 --> 19:41.981
No, no, it's not
about good or bad.

19:42.014 --> 19:45.252
Morality is a useless framework

19:45.285 --> 19:47.254
for ethical decision-making.

19:47.287 --> 19:50.257
PATTY: Lucas, you can try to
rationalize this all you want,

19:50.290 --> 19:52.392
but what you're doing is wrong
and you need to stop.

19:52.425 --> 19:55.362
Patty.
(chuckles softly)

19:55.395 --> 19:56.963
I'm gonna go now.

19:56.996 --> 19:58.731
Take care of yourself.
Lucas.

19:58.765 --> 20:01.934
It's Detective
Thomas Cavanaugh, SFPD.

20:01.968 --> 20:04.471
Look, I know you had a point
to make with what you did,

20:04.504 --> 20:07.707
but I think we all
got the message.

20:07.740 --> 20:10.710
No.

20:10.743 --> 20:12.745
No what?

20:12.779 --> 20:15.448
No, I'm not stopping.

20:15.482 --> 20:16.683
That's what you want, right?

20:16.716 --> 20:18.585
And, no,

20:18.618 --> 20:20.620
you haven't gotten the message.

20:20.653 --> 20:22.555
Not yet.

20:22.589 --> 20:26.793
But trust me, you will.

20:30.730 --> 20:32.332
Thank you.

20:32.365 --> 20:33.533
(Tanner clears throat)

20:35.735 --> 20:39.306
So, I, um...
(clears throat)

20:39.339 --> 20:42.309
...I had a meeting this morning

20:42.342 --> 20:43.676
with Nell at her office.

20:43.710 --> 20:46.579
Oh.
She made us an offer.

20:46.613 --> 20:49.982
Said she would drop the suit
and reduce the ask.

20:50.016 --> 20:52.319
And I could stay.

20:55.422 --> 20:56.723
I couldn't do it.

20:56.756 --> 20:58.658
Sara, I'm so sorry,
but you understand why.

20:58.691 --> 21:01.060
Once we give away ownership,
any ownership...

21:01.093 --> 21:02.495
(evidence alert blaring)

21:12.372 --> 21:13.540
(evidence alert blaring)

21:14.841 --> 21:15.842
It's a video call from a user.

21:15.875 --> 21:18.511
He's spotted Lucas King.

21:18.545 --> 21:21.080
SARA: Hi, uh, Karl.
Can you tell me what's going on?

21:21.113 --> 21:23.750
KARL: Yeah, that dude who killed
those people, he's here.

21:23.783 --> 21:25.585
Wait, hold on one second.

21:28.655 --> 21:30.523
I'm calling the police
right now.

21:32.459 --> 21:34.627
This is insane.
What do I do?

21:34.661 --> 21:36.629
Karl, how do you feel about
stalling him

21:36.663 --> 21:37.864
until the police get there?

21:37.897 --> 21:40.367
Okay, yeah.

21:40.400 --> 21:41.534
Wait. Sorry, how?

21:41.568 --> 21:44.404
Uh, what did he order?

21:44.437 --> 21:46.639
Egg-and-cheese everything bagel.

21:46.673 --> 21:47.807
Okay, great,
just tell him

21:47.840 --> 21:49.409
that you're out
of the everything bagel

21:49.442 --> 21:50.710
and you're gonna go
remake the order,

21:50.743 --> 21:52.111
but-but take your time.

21:52.144 --> 21:53.646
Can you do that for me?

21:53.680 --> 21:56.082
Yeah, I got this.
Wait, hold on.

21:56.115 --> 21:57.517
What are you doing?

21:57.550 --> 21:59.486
Listen...
This is a terrible idea.

21:59.519 --> 22:00.720
This guy killed
internet celebrities,

22:00.753 --> 22:03.456
not fast-food employees.

22:03.490 --> 22:04.824
Oh, you're sure
about that, are you?

22:04.857 --> 22:05.858
Sara, he's gonna murder
more people.

22:05.892 --> 22:07.794
We cannot let him get away.

22:07.827 --> 22:09.496
But you can't just...
Aw, crap!
I told him what you said,

22:09.529 --> 22:11.464
but I got all nervous,
and I think he could tell.

22:11.498 --> 22:13.833
He got spooked.
He just left.
Oh, thank God.

22:13.866 --> 22:15.635
You know what, screw it.
I'm going after him.

22:15.668 --> 22:16.503
Stop!
No, no, no.
No, no.

22:16.536 --> 22:17.604
I just want to see
which way he goes

22:17.637 --> 22:19.839
so I can tell the cops.
Don't chase after him. Karl?

22:19.872 --> 22:20.707
No, no, don't
go after him.

22:24.777 --> 22:26.413
(gun hammer clicks)

22:29.582 --> 22:32.552
What the hell are you doing?

22:32.585 --> 22:33.620
Detective, where are you?

22:33.653 --> 22:35.121
(siren wailing)
I'm a minute out.

22:37.724 --> 22:40.727
Come on, man.
Please.

22:42.862 --> 22:44.464
Just please don't hurt me.

22:47.467 --> 22:49.902
You're not the reason
I'm doing this.

22:57.677 --> 23:00.847
(siren approaching)
Oh, God... oh, God...

23:00.880 --> 23:01.914
He let me go.

23:01.948 --> 23:04.150
Uh, he's gone.

23:13.225 --> 23:15.662
(Tanner sighs)

23:15.695 --> 23:19.466
Look, I-I-I may
have just gone

23:19.499 --> 23:20.767
a little too far.

23:20.800 --> 23:23.536
"May have"?!

23:23.570 --> 23:26.606
You could have gotten
that man killed.

23:26.639 --> 23:29.909
Does anyone else
matter to you at all?

23:32.945 --> 23:35.982
As soon as you had
the offer from Nell,

23:36.015 --> 23:38.485
you should have
consulted with me.

23:38.518 --> 23:39.719
It wouldn't have
mattered.

23:39.752 --> 23:41.721
Hell, you-you would have
agreed with me.

23:41.754 --> 23:44.557
But I would have had
a say in it.

23:44.591 --> 23:46.893
I built my life
around this work,

23:46.926 --> 23:50.497
and my feelings were
irrelevant to you.

23:50.530 --> 23:51.931
You made a unilateral decision.

23:51.964 --> 23:53.700
Because it's my job.

23:53.733 --> 23:56.703
I'm in charge of this company,

23:56.736 --> 23:59.672
which means that
the hard decisions are mine

23:59.706 --> 24:01.608
and mine alone to make.

24:01.641 --> 24:02.642
I'm sorry.

24:02.675 --> 24:03.943
It's about Mia.

24:03.976 --> 24:05.478
It's not...
It's not about you.

24:05.512 --> 24:07.580
That much is bloody clear.

24:09.549 --> 24:11.718
(cell phone ringing)

24:15.588 --> 24:16.589
It's Mike.

24:18.725 --> 24:20.827
What's up?

24:26.833 --> 24:28.601
Judge ruled against us.

24:31.704 --> 24:33.573
(quietly):
Well, all right.

24:49.589 --> 24:51.991
Hey.
Hey.

24:52.024 --> 24:53.059
Have you seen Sara?

24:53.092 --> 24:54.994
No, she hasn't
been in yet.

24:55.027 --> 24:57.163
She's not coming back,
is she?

24:57.196 --> 24:59.298
Here.

24:59.331 --> 25:01.601
(chuckles softly)

25:01.634 --> 25:03.169
Talk to me.
Where are we?

25:03.202 --> 25:05.572
Uh, no more sightings
of Lucas, but instead

25:05.605 --> 25:07.540
of trying to where he is now,
we're trying to figure out

25:07.574 --> 25:08.841
where he's going next.
We're asking users to vote on

25:08.875 --> 25:09.942
who his next target's gonna be.

25:09.976 --> 25:12.144
Yeah, there are dozens

25:12.178 --> 25:12.912
of all AllSourcer celebrities
in the vicinity,

25:12.945 --> 25:14.814
but the crowd's
narrowed it to 15.

25:14.847 --> 25:16.583
All right, well, he was
last seen in the donut shop,

25:16.616 --> 25:18.585
so stands to reason
he's in that area.

25:18.618 --> 25:20.920
All right, let me sort the list
by proximity.

25:20.953 --> 25:23.255
TANNER: Then sort it again
by popularity on AllSourcer.

25:23.289 --> 25:25.191
Lucas wants to get his message
out, so he'll go for targets

25:25.224 --> 25:26.859
that give him
the most attention.

25:28.294 --> 25:29.996
JOSH:
These five.

25:30.029 --> 25:31.564
Give those five names
to Cavanaugh.
Great.

25:31.598 --> 25:34.133
(evidence alert blaring)

25:34.166 --> 25:36.636
Lucas just opened
another AllSourcer account.

25:36.669 --> 25:37.970
He's Live Streaming again.

25:38.004 --> 25:39.639
His user name is
"Lucas King oh-one."

25:39.672 --> 25:41.007
He's not even trying
to hide anymore.

25:41.040 --> 25:43.309
I know I don't have
much time left--

25:43.342 --> 25:44.677
I'll be apprehended soon.

25:44.711 --> 25:47.580
I have no control over that.

25:47.614 --> 25:49.148
But what I do have
control over is

25:49.181 --> 25:51.117
what I do with the time left.

25:51.150 --> 25:54.987
I will act, no matter
what the circum--

25:55.021 --> 25:56.623
I think AllSourcer
just cut the feed.

25:56.656 --> 25:57.323
At least they're
getting faster.

25:57.356 --> 26:00.693
Not fast enough.

26:00.727 --> 26:03.362
He's trying to make a statement
that people will remember.

26:03.395 --> 26:05.665
And as long as he has
a platform to broadcast,

26:05.698 --> 26:07.233
he's not gonna stop.

26:07.266 --> 26:08.968
So what do we do?

26:09.001 --> 26:10.970
We take away his platform.

26:14.907 --> 26:17.644
(phone ringing)

26:22.749 --> 26:25.384
Patty, you shouldn't
call me anymore.

26:25.417 --> 26:28.120
Lucas, it's
Detective Cavanaugh again.

26:28.154 --> 26:30.957
Please, don't hang up.
Just listen to me.

26:30.990 --> 26:32.358
When we spoke before,
you said

26:32.391 --> 26:34.661
people hadn't heard
your message yet.

26:34.694 --> 26:36.262
They have now.

26:36.295 --> 26:39.065
Millions of people
around the world, Lucas.

26:39.098 --> 26:42.034
I mean, that's what
you wanted, right?

26:42.068 --> 26:43.202
To be heard?

26:47.273 --> 26:48.741
The kid at the donut shop,

26:48.775 --> 26:50.076
you could have killed him,
but you didn't.

26:50.109 --> 26:54.180
And it's because
there is something in you

26:54.213 --> 26:57.083
that's telling you
that this is wrong, man.

26:57.116 --> 26:59.051
It doesn't matter, Detective.

26:59.085 --> 27:01.320
Right or wrong,
it's irrelevant.

27:01.353 --> 27:04.156
And you have no idea
how I feel.

27:06.058 --> 27:07.960
Lucas...
Don't call me anymore.

27:21.273 --> 27:23.342
What are you doing?

27:23.375 --> 27:26.378
My visa is contingent
upon me having a job here.

27:26.412 --> 27:29.281
Since that isn't
an option anymore...

27:29.315 --> 27:31.350
We should talk about this.

27:31.383 --> 27:33.452
We had an opportunity
to do that,

27:33.485 --> 27:35.054
but you made your choice.

27:35.087 --> 27:37.389
No, Sara, listen,
that doesn't mean

27:37.423 --> 27:38.758
that I don't care about you.

27:38.791 --> 27:40.359
All right?

27:40.392 --> 27:43.362
I don't...

27:43.395 --> 27:45.264
I don't know what
I would do without you.

27:45.297 --> 27:47.133
(phone ringing)

27:47.166 --> 27:49.969
You have work to do.
You should go.

27:50.002 --> 27:52.004
We don't need
to belabor this.

27:54.173 --> 27:56.308
Please-- Please don't
go like this, all right?

27:56.342 --> 27:57.977
Let's go to dinner.

27:58.010 --> 27:58.811
We'll talk about it,
all right?

27:58.845 --> 28:00.379
We can figure this out.

28:00.412 --> 28:01.480
I don't think
that's a good idea.

28:01.513 --> 28:03.716
I'm sorry, I don't.

28:05.417 --> 28:07.386
(phone ringing)

28:19.198 --> 28:20.399
(door shuts)

28:20.432 --> 28:22.301
(sobbing)

28:23.803 --> 28:26.338
Please, sit down.
Jeffrey, um,

28:26.372 --> 28:29.308
I can't even believe that
I'm here asking you this.

28:29.341 --> 28:31.143
I just... I saw
the new information

28:31.177 --> 28:33.079
that you posted
about Mia's case,

28:33.112 --> 28:35.381
and David keeps telling me
to stay off of Sophe,

28:35.414 --> 28:38.217
but... I just need to know--

28:38.250 --> 28:40.787
is there any truth to this?

28:40.820 --> 28:42.822
This is for real.

28:42.855 --> 28:44.423
I promise you.

28:44.456 --> 28:49.395
The guy that paid Flaco
to attack Carlos Ochoa,

28:49.428 --> 28:51.197
we have video on him.

28:51.230 --> 28:52.331
Cavanaugh's friend at the prison

28:52.364 --> 28:54.233
sent us this video, all right?

28:54.266 --> 28:56.502
The problem is, he was
pretending to be an attorney,

28:56.535 --> 28:59.038
so they put him in a private
room where there's no audio.

28:59.071 --> 29:01.507
So the video's useless,
isn't it?

29:01.540 --> 29:02.842
No, no, no, not
with Sophe-- come here.

29:02.875 --> 29:05.511
Let me show you something.

29:08.180 --> 29:10.382
ALEX: What am I looking at?
TANNER: Look at this.

29:10.416 --> 29:12.451
She can read lips.

29:12.484 --> 29:15.287
Okay, he's saying,

29:15.321 --> 29:18.557
"All you need to do
is keep an eye on him.

29:18.590 --> 29:21.828
"But if Carlos says
anything about Mia Tanner

29:21.861 --> 29:24.897
"and who might have
killed her, then...

29:26.498 --> 29:29.301
...you need to take him out."

29:31.503 --> 29:33.272
Now, the problem is...
Oh...

29:33.305 --> 29:34.573
...we don't know who
this guy is yet,

29:34.606 --> 29:36.342
but we put it out there.

29:36.375 --> 29:38.410
He's saying that
somebody else killed Mia?

29:38.444 --> 29:41.213
Yeah. Yes.

29:41.247 --> 29:42.815
Are you okay?

29:42.849 --> 29:44.817
Um...
You all right?

29:44.851 --> 29:46.853
I'm gonna get going.

29:48.520 --> 29:50.156
I have a...
(clears throat)

29:50.189 --> 29:51.423
I have a meeting, and
then I'll just call you.

29:51.457 --> 29:54.126
Okay.
Or you can...

29:54.160 --> 29:55.261
you can call me.
Okay.

30:02.368 --> 30:03.936
Hey, what's the status, guys?

30:03.970 --> 30:05.471
GREENE (over comm):
All quiet here.

30:05.504 --> 30:06.839
Not exactly.
(loud music playing in house)

30:06.873 --> 30:08.174
A lot of loud music
from the house.

30:08.207 --> 30:09.876
The lady's some kind of

30:09.909 --> 30:12.511
famous lip-syncher--
pretty weird.

30:12.544 --> 30:14.947
* Stickin' out their tongue
like, "Entertain us" *

30:14.981 --> 30:16.916
* Never been nothin'
but a fighter *

30:16.949 --> 30:19.185
* Never backed down,
never ran from a fire. *

30:19.218 --> 30:20.386
(music stops)

30:22.588 --> 30:24.823
*

30:26.893 --> 30:28.160
* What's the business?

30:28.194 --> 30:29.862
* I click my heels
and I wish... *

30:29.896 --> 30:31.530
CAVANAUGH: We're doing our
rounds between the targets.

30:31.563 --> 30:32.631
We're on our way to you now.

30:32.664 --> 30:33.900
(tires screeching)
Whoa!

30:38.504 --> 30:40.372
(horn stuck, blaring)

30:40.406 --> 30:41.640
Go, go.

30:41.673 --> 30:43.876
(horn blaring)

30:45.577 --> 30:47.246
(horn stops)

30:48.915 --> 30:50.149
What the hell?

30:50.182 --> 30:51.283
Are you okay?

30:51.317 --> 30:53.252
Do not move!

30:53.285 --> 30:54.420
Let her go!

30:54.453 --> 30:55.521
Put her down, now!

30:55.554 --> 30:57.523
(screaming)
Shut up!

30:57.556 --> 30:59.158
Drop the weapon!
Stay back!

30:59.191 --> 31:00.526
Let her go, now!

31:00.559 --> 31:03.195
Stay back!
Nice and easy.

31:04.563 --> 31:05.965
(woman screams)

31:11.370 --> 31:12.471
(siren, paramedic horn blaring)

31:12.504 --> 31:14.974
(indistinct radio chatter)

31:17.309 --> 31:19.545
The exits are covered,
snipers are ready to go.

31:19.578 --> 31:21.113
Let's talk entry
scenarios.

31:21.147 --> 31:22.915
No, not...
not quite yet.

31:22.949 --> 31:24.016
Excuse me, but
why the hell not?

31:24.050 --> 31:25.284
Just stand by, Captain.

31:25.317 --> 31:26.285
Keep your guys ready.

31:26.318 --> 31:27.286
Tanner, this way.

31:27.319 --> 31:28.921
Take off your jacket.
All right.

31:28.955 --> 31:32.024
Are you sure about this?
Listen...

31:32.058 --> 31:34.560
I speak his language,
for better or worse.

31:34.593 --> 31:36.528
Fine, just keep it
simple, all right?
All right.

31:36.562 --> 31:37.596
I got this.

31:39.465 --> 31:41.133
All right, just... just
keep him talking, okay?

31:41.167 --> 31:42.301
Okay, sir.

31:42.334 --> 31:45.037
Lucas.

31:45.071 --> 31:47.573
It's Detective Cavanaugh again.
LUCAS: Back off,

31:47.606 --> 31:50.709
or I swear she's dead!
(muffled scream)

31:50.742 --> 31:53.045
CAVANAUGH: Lucas.
Lucas, just calm down.

31:53.079 --> 31:55.681
I have someone out here
who would like to talk to you.

31:55.714 --> 31:57.683
Lucas.

31:57.716 --> 32:00.152
It's Jeffrey Tanner.

32:00.186 --> 32:04.723
October, 1995, you were
giving a symposium at Berkeley,

32:04.756 --> 32:06.392
on coding theory.
I was there.

32:06.425 --> 32:08.427
I tried to sneak in
15 minutes late,

32:08.460 --> 32:09.962
and you called me out
in front of the whole class.

32:09.996 --> 32:12.064
I don't know
if you remember.

32:12.098 --> 32:14.466
No.

32:14.500 --> 32:16.735
TANNER: It was the only time
that we met.

32:16.768 --> 32:19.005
But you said something that
I'll never forget that day.

32:19.038 --> 32:23.042
You said that "Any moron
can put up a website."

32:24.643 --> 32:26.478
LUCAS:
I used to say that a lot.

32:28.380 --> 32:30.382
And you were right.

32:30.416 --> 32:33.085
You knew where all this
was heading before anyone.

32:33.119 --> 32:35.754
Listen, I...

32:35.787 --> 32:37.756
I understand
why you're doing this.

32:37.789 --> 32:41.160
Believe me, I do.

32:41.193 --> 32:43.162
But the genie
is out of the bottle.

32:43.195 --> 32:46.665
We can't go back.

32:46.698 --> 32:48.734
The only thing we can do
is go forward.

32:56.242 --> 32:59.011
How?

33:01.180 --> 33:03.049
Let me in, Lucas.

33:03.082 --> 33:04.583
Let me in,
and we'll talk about it.

33:04.616 --> 33:05.784
Whoa, whoa-- hold on, Lucas.

33:05.817 --> 33:06.785
Wha-- what the hell
are you doing?

33:06.818 --> 33:08.120
Look, he's gonna kill her.

33:08.154 --> 33:10.156
Do you have another plan?

33:10.189 --> 33:12.524
Trust me.

33:14.426 --> 33:15.427
Lucas?

33:25.771 --> 33:27.639
Okay. Okay.

33:27.673 --> 33:29.475
But just you, all right?

33:29.508 --> 33:30.809
Everybody else, stand back!

33:30.842 --> 33:33.145
Whatever you want,
whatever you want.

33:33.179 --> 33:35.013
Just calm down, Lucas.
Come on, come on,
come on, come on.

33:44.856 --> 33:46.258
(crying)

33:46.292 --> 33:48.127
Hey! Hey-- hey...

33:50.596 --> 33:52.231
Stay-- no, no, no.

33:52.264 --> 33:54.133
No, no, no, no.

33:54.166 --> 33:55.734
No.

33:55.767 --> 33:58.270
You said we could move forward.

33:58.304 --> 33:59.838
How?

33:59.871 --> 34:01.640
Not like this.

34:01.673 --> 34:05.211
Well, somebody's got
to hold up the mirror.

34:05.244 --> 34:09.848
Somebody's got to show how toxic
all this has become.

34:09.881 --> 34:13.252
I believe that's
how it started.

34:13.285 --> 34:15.187
But that's not
what you're doing now.

34:15.221 --> 34:18.290
Now it's about you.

34:18.324 --> 34:22.194
It's about you
making people pay

34:22.228 --> 34:24.463
for all the pain
that you've been through.

34:24.496 --> 34:25.664
No, no, you...

34:25.697 --> 34:27.199
You don't understand.

34:27.233 --> 34:29.201
You don't know
what you're talking about.

34:29.235 --> 34:31.203
Believe me, I do.

34:31.237 --> 34:34.606
I feel that pain every day.

34:34.640 --> 34:36.208
You can kill
this girl.

34:36.242 --> 34:38.244
You can kill
every celebrity on AllSourcer.

34:38.277 --> 34:40.512
But tomorrow morning,
you're gonna wake up,

34:40.546 --> 34:43.749
and you're gonna feel
the same way.

34:43.782 --> 34:45.751
LUCAS:
No. You're wrong.

34:45.784 --> 34:50.222
See, I'm doing this, uh,
you know, I-I-- because...

34:50.256 --> 34:53.759
I'm doing this
because I have a purpose.

34:53.792 --> 34:56.162
I want people
to see that...

34:56.195 --> 34:58.297
See? On Live Stream?

34:58.330 --> 35:01.733
Yeah.
When's the last time
that you logged on?

35:01.767 --> 35:03.735
It's been taken off-line.

35:03.769 --> 35:07.539
My people
hacked into it.

35:07.573 --> 35:08.740
We shut it down.

35:08.774 --> 35:10.709
No, no...

35:12.778 --> 35:14.913
No one will be able to see
your message anymore.

35:14.946 --> 35:16.815
Lucas.

35:18.950 --> 35:21.820
You have to let her go.

35:28.727 --> 35:30.696
(dispatcher speaks indistinctly)

35:39.305 --> 35:41.573
There he is.
Oh, thank God.

35:45.944 --> 35:46.945
(crying)
Hey. It's all right.

35:46.978 --> 35:48.947
It's all right. Okay.

35:48.980 --> 35:50.616
CAVANAUGH:
Good work, good work.

35:50.649 --> 35:52.251
All right. Get back now.

35:56.955 --> 35:58.657
CAVANAUGH:
Okay, Lucas!

35:58.690 --> 36:00.158
You can come out, now.

36:04.330 --> 36:06.732
Lucas, put down the weapon now!

36:12.238 --> 36:13.839
Lucas. Drop it...
Put it down!

36:13.872 --> 36:17.609
CAVANAUGH: ...and
get on the ground!

36:17.643 --> 36:19.345
TANNER: Put it
down, Lucas.

36:20.912 --> 36:22.214
Don't you see?

36:22.248 --> 36:23.949
He wants you to shoot him.

36:23.982 --> 36:26.385
He wants another spectacle.
Don't give it to him.

36:26.418 --> 36:27.786
Don't give it to him!

36:32.258 --> 36:34.660
Lucas...

36:37.663 --> 36:38.764
No!

36:51.743 --> 36:53.379
(knocking on door)

36:56.915 --> 36:58.750
Hey.

37:01.787 --> 37:03.655
Nice place.

37:03.689 --> 37:05.657
You should invite me up
more often.

37:05.691 --> 37:07.759
To what do I owe the pleasure?

37:07.793 --> 37:09.261
Remember how you thought
Lucas got around

37:09.295 --> 37:11.029
the Live Stream safeguards
by hacking?

37:11.062 --> 37:14.666
I think
you were wrong.

37:14.700 --> 37:16.902
I may have, uh, stumbled across
this during the hack.

37:24.476 --> 37:28.347
In the last 36 hours,
our stock is down 15%.

37:28.380 --> 37:30.816
So let's open the floor
and get some ideas rolling.

37:30.849 --> 37:32.318
Sorry to interrupt, everyone.

37:32.351 --> 37:36.288
But we're gonna
need this room.

37:36.322 --> 37:38.924
(door closes)

37:38.957 --> 37:40.792
Take five, people.

37:59.711 --> 38:01.713
You do realize
we're amending our suit.

38:01.747 --> 38:05.751
You don't strike me as
the overly litigious type, now.

38:05.784 --> 38:08.887
Make jokes all you want,
Jeffrey, but hacking AllSourcer?

38:08.920 --> 38:10.756
You actually think
you'll get away with that?

38:10.789 --> 38:12.358
TANNER:
Actually, I do.

38:12.391 --> 38:14.092
What is this?

38:14.125 --> 38:16.027
Proof. That you compromised

38:16.061 --> 38:19.365
Live Stream's safeguards
for monetary gain.

38:19.398 --> 38:21.733
Excuse me?
See, when I was CEO,

38:21.767 --> 38:24.035
we had thousands
of live human moderators.

38:24.069 --> 38:26.037
It is truly the only way
to police

38:26.071 --> 38:28.507
what gets posted on Live Stream.

38:28.540 --> 38:30.342
MIKE: According to those
personnel records, you cut back

38:30.376 --> 38:31.977
by 90%, Nell.

38:32.010 --> 38:34.846
That's how Lucas King
got past the safeguards.

38:34.880 --> 38:35.881
There was no one
minding the store.

38:37.516 --> 38:39.751
Where did you get this?

38:39.785 --> 38:40.852
Does it matter?

38:40.886 --> 38:41.987
MIKE:
Saved a lot of cash, I bet.

38:42.020 --> 38:43.789
Look, I'm not too
proud to admit,

38:43.822 --> 38:45.857
but I did suggest the same thing
to Jeffrey once.

38:47.459 --> 38:49.895
And you see why I said no,
don't you?

38:49.928 --> 38:53.131
No? Okay.

38:53.164 --> 38:56.768
Well, then, I th-- I think
a public shaming is in order.

38:56.802 --> 38:58.970
Live Stream press conference.

38:59.004 --> 39:00.506
MIKE: How long do
you think it will be

39:00.539 --> 39:02.974
until the board fires her?
Hours?

39:03.008 --> 39:04.075
Probably crack under pressure.
I don't know.
Gonna be quick.

39:04.109 --> 39:06.011
Try it.

39:06.044 --> 39:07.779
We could.

39:07.813 --> 39:09.347
Or we could make a deal.

39:11.116 --> 39:13.552
Drop the lawsuit.

39:13.585 --> 39:16.054
Forget about this
alleged hacking.

39:16.087 --> 39:18.557
And most importantly,
leave Sara alone.

39:20.426 --> 39:22.027
And you won't mind
that the world

39:22.060 --> 39:24.095
still thinks the safeguards
were your fault?

39:24.129 --> 39:25.931
It'll eat me alive,

39:25.964 --> 39:28.099
but at least my company
will be whole.

39:28.133 --> 39:29.801
I can live with that.

39:35.173 --> 39:37.008
Fine.

39:37.042 --> 39:39.411
Whatever.

39:43.582 --> 39:46.852
You're a miserable person, Nell.

39:48.086 --> 39:49.921
Good-bye, Jeffrey.

39:54.225 --> 39:56.928
(door opens, closes)

39:56.962 --> 39:58.497
Would it kill
you to smile?

39:58.530 --> 40:00.198
For old times' sake, Mike?

40:00.231 --> 40:02.033
Let me see
those chompers.

40:02.067 --> 40:03.935
Bring it in.

40:03.969 --> 40:05.203
Whoa, whoa-- wait,
oh... wait, oh... okay.

40:05.236 --> 40:06.938
My little salt and
pepper Pooh Bear.

40:06.972 --> 40:09.040
That is awesome. Okeydokey.
Mm...

40:12.944 --> 40:14.045
So, you're probably
not gonna believe me.

40:14.079 --> 40:15.213
Probably not.

40:15.246 --> 40:16.948
But I was never worried.

40:16.982 --> 40:18.550
I knew you weren't
going anywhere.

40:18.584 --> 40:21.086
Well, I wish you would've
imparted this confidence to me.

40:21.119 --> 40:22.554
No, see, that can't be
taught. That's a gift.

40:22.588 --> 40:23.589
SARA: Ah.
That's just what
I'm born with. Yeah.

40:23.622 --> 40:25.023
Oh, I see. Right.

40:25.056 --> 40:26.157
I'll keep that in mind.

40:26.191 --> 40:28.093
TANNER:
Hey.

40:28.126 --> 40:29.595
When did you get back?

40:29.628 --> 40:31.597
Uh, just a few minutes ago.

40:31.630 --> 40:33.632
It's over.

40:33.665 --> 40:35.200
Yeah.

40:35.233 --> 40:37.869
It's-it's hard to believe.

40:43.642 --> 40:45.511
(clears throat)
You know what?

40:45.544 --> 40:47.145
Can we talk for a second?

40:47.178 --> 40:49.180
Sure.

41:04.295 --> 41:06.898
This isn't gonna work, is it?

41:12.303 --> 41:16.274
I was a pawn in a game.

41:16.307 --> 41:20.045
I'm never gonna be okay
with that.

41:20.078 --> 41:23.582
I don't blame you.

41:25.717 --> 41:29.154
I don't blame you, either.

41:29.187 --> 41:32.157
I know that you were

41:32.190 --> 41:37.162
trying to do what was best
for Mia, but...

41:37.195 --> 41:40.932
I need someone who's gonna
put me first.

41:40.966 --> 41:42.167
Yeah.
Do you understand?

41:42.200 --> 41:44.636
Yeah.

41:44.670 --> 41:47.172
I care about you
so much, and...

41:47.205 --> 41:50.976
the work here is everything.

41:51.009 --> 41:55.046
But...
it's really hard to do both.

41:55.080 --> 41:57.048
So...

41:59.585 --> 42:02.520
we'll just focus on the work.

42:04.690 --> 42:06.191
All right.
Yeah.

42:06.224 --> 42:07.225
Listen.

42:07.258 --> 42:09.628
We're gonna be fine.

42:09.661 --> 42:11.697
Don't worry.
Right.

42:15.100 --> 42:16.167
I'll see you later.

42:16.201 --> 42:18.003
All right.

42:21.039 --> 42:22.708
(phone ringing)

42:28.980 --> 42:30.148
(phone beeps)

42:30.181 --> 42:31.349
Yeah.

42:31.382 --> 42:34.753
Hey.

42:34.786 --> 42:36.788
I'm in.

42:36.822 --> 42:40.659
Whoever did this,
we'll find them.

42:40.692 --> 42:43.729
Together.

42:43.762 --> 42:46.097
That's all I had to say.

42:46.131 --> 42:47.365
Um, just...

42:47.398 --> 42:50.702
take care of yourself, okay?

42:50.736 --> 42:55.240
Bye.
