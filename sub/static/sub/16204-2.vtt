what are some of the questions

02:38.359 --> 02:40.261
What are some of things
we should be thinking about?

02:40.294 --> 02:42.830
Sure.
I think the first thing

02:42.863 --> 02:46.434
that you should think about
as you go on India Gaycation

02:46.467 --> 02:51.272
is that in India, the trajectory
of being LGBT is not --

02:51.305 --> 02:52.673
it's not linear at all,

02:52.706 --> 02:55.409
but there are deep
historical narratives.

02:55.443 --> 02:57.611
We have are own
LGBT mythologies.

02:57.645 --> 02:58.912
So to understand that --

02:58.946 --> 03:00.781
what's happening
on the LGBT scene today

03:00.814 --> 03:03.484
is an interplay both
between our history,

03:03.517 --> 03:06.554
our mythology
and of our presence

03:06.587 --> 03:08.789
in a very globalized
LGBT environment.

03:08.822 --> 03:13.761
Um, but I think being queer here
is really about community.

03:13.794 --> 03:16.364
You are not queer alone.

03:16.397 --> 03:17.965
You know, you're queer
in your family,

03:17.998 --> 03:19.800
you're queer with your friends,
you're queer at work.

03:19.833 --> 03:22.836
Every decision you take
is not about self.

03:22.870 --> 03:25.839
Maybe you can also speak
to the impact of colonialism

03:25.873 --> 03:27.808
and sort of what
that has meant

03:27.841 --> 03:29.877
for the community
in this country.

03:29.910 --> 03:31.945
Sure. Sure.
So, pre-colonial India

03:31.979 --> 03:34.248
had a range of possibilities,

03:34.282 --> 03:37.418
and you can see it
if you look at our text.

03:37.451 --> 03:38.986
The colonial project was about,

03:39.019 --> 03:41.355
you know, simplifying
and classifying.

03:41.389 --> 03:46.760
The British gave us Section 377,
which is very problematic.

03:46.794 --> 03:48.996
And I think the reason
why this law stays

03:49.029 --> 03:51.999
and why there is so much
discrimination in society itself

03:52.032 --> 03:54.335
is because of nationalism.

03:54.368 --> 03:57.805
It's because in this imagination
of India post-independence,

03:57.838 --> 04:00.674
LGBT diversity is something
that was ignored.

04:00.708 --> 04:04.044
And I think a lot of people
absorbed colonial, in hangover,

04:04.077 --> 04:06.814
kind of their colonial values
and mind-sets.

04:06.847 --> 04:11.585
Page: Section 377 is a
19th-century British imposed law

04:11.619 --> 04:16.624
that criminalizes intercourse
"against the order of nature,"

04:16.657 --> 04:20.761
which has been interpreted
to persecute homosexuals.

04:20.794 --> 04:24.865
Though it was lifted
for consenting adults in 2009,

04:24.898 --> 04:28.001
it was fully reinstated in 2014.

04:28.035 --> 04:32.806
And so the fight for LGBTQ
rights in India continues.

This law, Article 377,

04:42.550 --> 04:44.818
what power does
it actually have?

04:44.852 --> 04:46.720
The fact that this law exists

04:46.754 --> 04:49.823
means that any man who's LGBT
is always afraid.

04:49.857 --> 04:52.660
It's often used
as a form of threat.

04:52.693 --> 04:56.664
It's often used as an excuse
to not give people rights.

04:56.697 --> 04:58.966
It's just something
which is fundamental

04:58.999 --> 05:02.069
to our being recognized as
citizens in our own country.

-Right.
-It's a very base argument.

But in 2009, when that
was repealed, right?

05:07.808 --> 05:09.810
Yeah.
People were coming out
of the closet.

05:09.843 --> 05:11.945
There was a real celebration,
and I would assume,

05:11.979 --> 05:14.114
some sort of feeling
of liberation that happened.

05:14.147 --> 05:15.749

05:15.783 --> 05:17.951
we had all these
celebratory marches,

05:17.985 --> 05:19.453

this thing comes

05:19.487 --> 05:20.954
as one big slap
to everyone's face.

05:20.988 --> 05:22.790
And then what do you do?
I mean, you're all out, right?

05:22.823 --> 05:24.525

05:24.558 --> 05:28.061
that a journey towards equality
is not a linear journey.

progress, progress, progress.

05:30.564 --> 05:32.366

05:32.400 --> 05:35.669

reversal, while very wrong,

has actually galvanized
the community to act together,

05:39.540 --> 05:41.008
to strategize better.

we have around three generations
living here.

10:06.073 --> 10:07.274
Wow.

10:07.307 --> 10:09.176
That's how Indian
families have been.

10:09.209 --> 10:10.978
They'll take a big house,

10:11.011 --> 10:13.413
and all of them would live
together -- really close knit.

10:13.446 --> 10:16.316
So, far as the concept
of dating is very new.

10:16.349 --> 10:18.351
-Right.
-Because family --

10:18.385 --> 10:20.854
if you don't find a family
for yourself,

10:20.888 --> 10:22.122
we'll find one for you.

10:22.155 --> 10:23.924
So, and when they
find one for you,

10:23.957 --> 10:25.959
they will find somebody
from the same language,

10:25.993 --> 10:27.127
from the same caste.

10:27.160 --> 10:28.328
So how does -- how does love

10:28.361 --> 10:29.362
come in to play
in all of this?

10:29.396 --> 10:30.864
I wouldn't call it love.

10:30.898 --> 10:32.666
But, you know, staying together,

10:32.700 --> 10:35.435
you have to make a lot of
adjustments and compromises.

going to talk -- to talk

10:37.905 --> 10:39.172

just been

that ad

to be a secret.

than actually to fall in love

13:09.056 --> 13:11.458
I see the issues and the way
you've dealt with them

13:11.491 --> 13:12.893
is totally different.

13:12.926 --> 13:14.394
You know,
when you're gay or lesbian,

13:14.427 --> 13:16.529
you don't really form
part of the mainstream.

You come out, and that's how you
have a gay subculture

13:19.599 --> 13:22.402
because you are really not
wanted in the family.

13:22.435 --> 13:25.105
But here, the gay
or lesbian children

13:25.138 --> 13:26.840
are left behind children

13:26.874 --> 13:29.209
because children
are a social treasure.

13:29.242 --> 13:33.446
So we may have to contend with
the more conservative movement.

there's no identity called gay.

Mm-hmm.

16:32.392 --> 16:34.694
I can speak for all three

16:34.727 --> 16:38.065

it's still, uh, difficult.
