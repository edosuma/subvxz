00:50.250 --> 00:52.741
When did the angel lose her wings

00:52.852 --> 00:56.185
When she flew from the realms
and the darker dreams

00:56.289 --> 00:58.883
All the gold melted down
and the gates were closed

00:58.992 --> 01:00.391
Daddy!

01:00.527 --> 01:02.620
Life was revealed
and the past exposed

01:02.729 --> 01:06.995
Oh, oh, oh, from back to forth
Sister, oh, oh, oh...

01:07.500 --> 01:09.900
- Hey, Daddy.
- Hey, morning, baby girl.

01:10.003 --> 01:12.028
Promise me,
anything you don't know how to fix,

01:12.138 --> 01:13.435
you'll leave it for a handyman.

01:13.540 --> 01:17.169
Leslie, I got this.
You worry about getting to work on time.

01:17.577 --> 01:20.569
- Have fun tonight on your date.
- I will.

01:21.714 --> 01:24.615
I'm getting somewhere

01:24.717 --> 01:27.777
I'm gonna be there

01:27.887 --> 01:30.412
I'm gonna be there

01:30.523 --> 01:33.287
Been dreaming, dreaming, dreaming

01:33.393 --> 01:36.157
Been dreaming, dreaming, dreaming

01:36.262 --> 01:39.231
Been dreaming, dreaming, dreaming

01:39.332 --> 01:42.961
Been dreaming, dreaming, dreaming

01:43.069 --> 01:45.469
When did the angel fade from white?

01:45.572 --> 01:49.008
Lost her place in the clouds
Took her cues from the night

01:49.109 --> 01:51.703
Set apart by the fall
that destroyed her grace

01:51.811 --> 01:55.110
But the heat from the flames
never touched her face

01:55.215 --> 01:57.911
I rise in the day
of the blazing sun

01:58.017 --> 02:01.145
Saw above all the hate
in the need of blood

02:01.254 --> 02:04.382
I was pressed to succumb to
the dragging down

02:04.491 --> 02:08.291
Yeah, my hand grabbed the line
and I pulled me out

02:08.394 --> 02:12.160
Oh, oh, oh, from back to forth
Sister, oh, oh, oh...

02:12.932 --> 02:14.490
Hey, Leslie. How you doing?

02:16.669 --> 02:18.000
Good morning.

02:18.371 --> 02:19.338
Hey.

02:25.345 --> 02:28.041
Looking good. Improvement. I like it.

02:28.148 --> 02:29.547
- Just remember to keep that elbow in.
- Okay.

02:29.649 --> 02:31.879
Let me take one of these plates off for you.

02:31.985 --> 02:33.850
Now, work your way back up
to that next plate now.

02:33.953 --> 02:35.181
All right.

02:35.922 --> 02:37.947
- Hey, girl.
- What time is the blind date?

02:38.057 --> 02:40.423
- 8:00.
- 8:00? What you gonna wear?

02:40.693 --> 02:41.785
- Black.
- Black.

02:42.829 --> 02:44.194
See you tomorrow.

02:45.498 --> 02:48.467
I'm getting somewhere

02:48.768 --> 02:51.635
I'm gonna be there

02:51.804 --> 02:54.272
I'm gonna be there

02:54.474 --> 02:56.999
Been dreaming, dreaming, dreaming

02:57.243 --> 03:00.235
Been dreaming, dreaming, dreaming

03:00.446 --> 03:03.415
Been dreaming, dreaming, dreaming

03:04.150 --> 03:07.278
Been dreaming, dreaming, dreaming

03:12.992 --> 03:14.687
Can I get a little help over here?

03:14.827 --> 03:16.954
- Ticket, please.
- Hello?

03:19.966 --> 03:21.194
- Just give it a little pull.
- Okay.

03:21.301 --> 03:23.428
One, two, three!

03:24.504 --> 03:25.664
Sorry.

03:26.206 --> 03:27.764
Sorry about that.

03:29.943 --> 03:32.537
All righty. Take good care of her now.

03:43.089 --> 03:44.716
Hello, Denzel.

03:50.396 --> 03:51.454
Mark?

03:51.731 --> 03:53.255
- Leslie?
- Yes.

03:53.366 --> 03:55.231
- Nice to meet you.
- You, too. Thank you.

03:55.335 --> 03:56.461
- Shall we?
- Yeah, sure.

03:56.569 --> 03:57.661
All right.

03:59.539 --> 04:03.475
It was like the skies opened up
and I heard the angels singing.

04:03.576 --> 04:05.407
And that's when I knew.

04:06.412 --> 04:08.880
- A little more wine?
- Thank you.

04:09.882 --> 04:11.577
So, what about kids?

04:12.018 --> 04:13.713
As many as we can have.

04:13.820 --> 04:16.345
- Wow.
- I mean, at least two or three kids.

04:16.456 --> 04:17.480
- Really? As long as...
- Absolutely.

04:17.589 --> 04:18.887
All those hours you work?

04:18.992 --> 04:22.120
You have a pretty demanding career
as well, though. Physical therapy.

04:22.228 --> 04:23.991
- There we go.
- Cheers.

04:24.430 --> 04:27.831
Everybody I know who tries tiramisu
is hooked on it.

04:27.934 --> 04:29.526
I don't want to be the next junkie in line.

04:29.636 --> 04:32.070
And you know what? I'm your pusher.

04:32.572 --> 04:33.732
All right?

04:33.840 --> 04:35.171
Open wide.

04:37.410 --> 04:39.310
That is delicious.

04:39.412 --> 04:41.403
We need to wash this down
with some dessert wine.

04:41.514 --> 04:42.606
- I agree.
- Why not?

04:42.715 --> 04:44.273
Let's get toasted.

04:44.384 --> 04:45.874
Let's... Let's get twisted.

04:47.320 --> 04:50.551
You want me to keep feeding you?
We can do this all night.

04:50.657 --> 04:51.885
All night?

04:53.259 --> 04:55.420
- Wow.
- I had such a great time tonight.

04:55.528 --> 04:56.722
- Me, too.
- Yes. Absolutely.

04:56.829 --> 05:00.424
You know, next time maybe we could
catch a movie or, better yet, a Nets game.

05:00.533 --> 05:02.831
You are such an amazing woman.

05:03.469 --> 05:07.565
I'm serious. I mean, any man that gets you
is gonna be beyond lucky.

05:10.243 --> 05:13.735
I'm just out of a very long relationship.

05:13.846 --> 05:17.441
And, you know,
my feelings are still kind of raw.

05:17.550 --> 05:19.984
- I miss her, it's...
- You're not emotionally ready.

05:20.086 --> 05:22.179
- Yeah.
- And you need to be ready.

05:22.288 --> 05:24.882
Yes. I am so happy you get it.

05:24.991 --> 05:26.788
See, you're the bomb.com,
that's what I'm talking about.

05:26.893 --> 05:28.053
I mean, you know, but we can still...

05:28.161 --> 05:29.526
- Hang out.
- ...hang out.

05:30.063 --> 05:31.052
Yeah, I mean, you're, you're...

05:31.164 --> 05:32.688
- Good people.
- ...good people.

05:35.101 --> 05:36.830
Look, I'm sorry, I'm...

05:37.337 --> 05:38.702
Can I get a hug?

05:39.005 --> 05:40.563
- Sure.
- Thank you.

05:42.742 --> 05:44.937
Yes. What kind of car do you have?

05:45.445 --> 05:46.673
He knows.

05:46.779 --> 05:48.178
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

05:49.282 --> 05:50.340
So,

05:51.417 --> 05:53.078
how about them Nets, huh?

06:07.767 --> 06:09.701
So, how was the date?

06:10.370 --> 06:11.894
- Was he cute?
- Yep.

06:12.004 --> 06:13.665
- And?
- And he thought

06:13.773 --> 06:15.707
I made the perfect homegirl.

06:16.376 --> 06:17.604
I'm sorry.

06:18.811 --> 06:21.678
But you do have homegirl
written all over you.

06:21.781 --> 06:23.578
What? I'm just being my regular self.

06:23.683 --> 06:25.412
You are not supposed to show him
your regular self

06:25.518 --> 06:27.918
until you've been married for five years.

06:28.020 --> 06:29.044
What is all this?

06:29.155 --> 06:30.144
Research.

06:30.256 --> 06:32.747
I was reading The Power of Now
and it dawned on me,

06:32.859 --> 06:36.955
a girl doesn't just become the wife
of an NBA franchise player by accident.

06:37.063 --> 06:39.258
It takes strategy, good intel,

06:39.565 --> 06:40.896
and vision.

06:41.167 --> 06:44.136
I'm sure that's what Eckhart Tolle
thought when he wrote that book.

06:44.237 --> 06:45.363
Say what you want,

06:45.471 --> 06:47.496
but don't be hating on your girl
when she's a brand.

06:47.607 --> 06:48.835
Morgan, what are you talking about?

06:48.941 --> 06:50.499
These NBA players' wives?

06:50.610 --> 06:55.070
I mean, one's got a fragrance,
the other has a clothing line coming out.

06:55.181 --> 06:56.239
Brands.

06:56.349 --> 06:57.748
I'm almost 30.

06:57.850 --> 07:00.978
I got to start thinking about my future,
like now.

07:03.022 --> 07:04.990
You really scare me sometimes.

07:05.091 --> 07:07.525
You know, you're crashing
in my guest room.

07:07.627 --> 07:10.926
Your BMW got repossessed
'cause you stopped making the payments.

07:11.030 --> 07:14.625
Does any of this research
involve you getting a job?

07:15.101 --> 07:17.729
This is my job. Have you been listening?

07:19.605 --> 07:21.004
- I'm going to bed.
- Good night.

07:21.107 --> 07:22.938
You still rolling to the game
with me tomorrow?

07:23.042 --> 07:26.978
Already working on my outfit.
It takes good bait to catch a fish.

07:28.214 --> 07:30.705
I must be fishing in the wrong river.

07:36.389 --> 07:37.481
Okay.

07:38.691 --> 07:41.660
Warm, feminine, peachy.

07:43.129 --> 07:44.357
Hey, Mom.

07:46.532 --> 07:49.330
How you gonna get a man
dressed like that?

07:49.435 --> 07:51.494
Well, Ma, I'm going to the game.

07:51.604 --> 07:54.164
And, no. Where's Daddy?

07:54.273 --> 07:57.731
He's in the kitchen
working on another one of your projects.

08:01.647 --> 08:03.114
- Daddy.
- Yeah?

08:03.216 --> 08:05.776
I thought we said we were gonna let
a plumber handle those new faucets.

08:05.885 --> 08:10.049
Well, why waste your money on a plumber
when your dad's got this under control?

08:10.156 --> 08:11.453
Leslie!

08:12.492 --> 08:15.325
Now this is how you get a man.

08:18.798 --> 08:20.322
I told her to wear a dress.

08:20.433 --> 08:21.923
To a basketball game?

08:22.034 --> 08:23.092
Yeah.

08:25.037 --> 08:26.698
We have just minutes to go here

08:26.806 --> 08:29.934
in the fourth quarter
of the season opener at the lzod Center.

08:30.042 --> 08:32.533
The New Jersey Nets up by 10
over the Orlando Magic,

08:32.645 --> 08:36.376
thanks much to the tremendous effort
by star point guard Scott McKnight.

08:36.482 --> 08:38.506
McKnight, one of the best point guards
in the league,

08:38.618 --> 08:40.245
Iiving up to that reputation tonight.

08:40.352 --> 08:42.684
Dribbles left, looks inside,
he 's got nothing there.

08:42.788 --> 08:45.154
He 's gonna take it himself,
behind the back, he puts it up.

08:45.258 --> 08:47.488
It is good, and he 's fouled on the play.

08:47.593 --> 08:49.151
And that could be the dagger,

08:49.262 --> 08:53.062
even though there 's plenty of time
left here in this ball game.

08:53.165 --> 08:54.655
Any Orlando fans here in the Center...

08:54.767 --> 08:56.894
- Go! Let's go!
- ...ha ve got to be feeling the pain.

08:57.336 --> 09:00.635
Code blue! Code blue! Get a crash cart
in here, we losing the patient!

09:00.740 --> 09:02.367
Hold up! We losing the patient!

09:04.243 --> 09:08.577
Scott McKnight shot 89%
from the free throw line last season,

09:08.681 --> 09:11.309
but he has been 100% tonight.

09:12.985 --> 09:14.714
Let's see ifhe stays on his hot streak.

09:15.421 --> 09:18.618
And he's done it.
That's 11 in a row for Scott McKnight,

09:18.724 --> 09:21.056
and Dwight Howard
has 12 rebounds on the night.

09:21.160 --> 09:23.424
Look at that. Look at that!

09:24.230 --> 09:26.357
I love the players' wives section.

09:26.465 --> 09:29.525
Girl, the most exclusive three rows
in any arena.

09:29.635 --> 09:31.227
Leslie, you should see her bag.

09:31.337 --> 09:33.669
She's got the new Domenico Vacca.
Nobody's got that yet. Nobody.

09:35.107 --> 09:37.007
McKnight's not gonna make that shot.

09:37.109 --> 09:39.373
What? Hold up! Hold up! I'm getting a call.

09:39.478 --> 09:40.536
McKnight, to his right.

09:40.646 --> 09:43.444
It's long distance!

09:44.283 --> 09:45.750
Shut up, lady!

09:45.851 --> 09:48.843
I would shut up, but wait, hold up,
I'm getting another phone call.

09:48.955 --> 09:51.515
Hello. Oh, it's President Obama.

09:51.624 --> 09:53.683
He wants to spend some money
on defense.

09:54.026 --> 09:57.393
Cross-court, stolen by Scott McKnight.
Here he comes the other way.

09:57.496 --> 09:59.589
McKnight lays it up and in.

09:59.999 --> 10:02.058
The Nets are up by a bundle.

10:02.568 --> 10:04.001
Uh-oh! Y'all in trouble now.

10:04.103 --> 10:06.037
Here comes the Magic,
bringing it up the floor...

10:06.138 --> 10:08.003
It's stolen again by Scott McKnight.

10:08.107 --> 10:11.668
Here comes McKnight,
and number 19 slams it home.

10:11.777 --> 10:13.472
The Nets are pouring it on.

10:14.146 --> 10:18.242
Dwight Howard clearly upset,
as he inbounds the ball to Rashard Lewis.

10:18.351 --> 10:21.218
Come on, don't, don't...
Don't die on me, Orlando, don't die on me.

10:21.721 --> 10:23.746
For three. Bembrey gets a piece of it.

10:23.856 --> 10:27.690
McKnight with the rebound, the clock
winds down and that's gonna do it.

10:27.793 --> 10:30.728
Unbelievable performance
by Scott McKnight.

10:31.597 --> 10:33.690
Time of death, 10:19.

10:33.799 --> 10:34.857
Nets suck.

10:34.967 --> 10:38.334
Shut y'all down.
Shut y'all down, every time.

10:38.437 --> 10:39.461
It's a great game.

10:39.572 --> 10:40.869
Let's get out of here
before we get killed, come on.

10:40.973 --> 10:41.962
Yeah!

10:43.743 --> 10:45.267
Congratulations, tremendous game,

10:45.378 --> 10:46.640
- tremendous game.
- Thanks. Thanks, man, thanks.

10:46.746 --> 10:49.044
Almost a decade with the Nets,
the only franchise

10:49.148 --> 10:50.581
- you've ever played for...
- Good game, man.

10:50.683 --> 10:52.981
...but you're a free agent
at the end of this season.

10:53.085 --> 10:55.144
The question everyone wants to know,

10:55.254 --> 10:58.155
"Will Scott McKnight re-sign
with the Nets?"

10:58.591 --> 11:01.025
I prove myself night in
and night out on that court.

11:01.127 --> 11:02.754
Nets fans know what I'm worth.

11:02.862 --> 11:04.887
Hopefully the Nets front office
knows it, too.

11:04.997 --> 11:06.862
- So what you're saying is...
- So what I'm saying is,

11:06.966 --> 11:10.129
- it's good to see you, J.
- All right, for sure. Congratulations.

11:10.236 --> 11:12.466
That was great, man.
I think you just started a bidding war.

11:12.571 --> 11:14.061
I don't want a bidding war.

11:14.173 --> 11:16.164
You know, I wanna stay a Net.
Red and blue...

11:16.275 --> 11:19.108
"Runs through my veins," you've been
saying that since the day they drafted you.

11:19.211 --> 11:20.269
Sweet Lew!

11:20.379 --> 11:22.472
- What up, man?
- Good game, way to shoot the ball.

11:22.581 --> 11:23.775
- Thanks, man.
- Hey, I'll see you All-Star Weekend.

11:23.883 --> 11:25.214
All-Star, yes, sir.

11:26.218 --> 11:28.118
There you are, girl.
I've been looking everywhere for you.

11:28.220 --> 11:29.244
- Hey.
- Hey, Leslie.

11:29.355 --> 11:30.845
- What's up?
- It's packed up in here.

11:30.956 --> 11:32.548
I know, girl, what's up?

11:32.658 --> 11:37.061
Scott McKnight is having a birthday party
Saturday night at his house.

11:37.163 --> 11:38.824
I know y'all trying to be up in the spot.

11:38.931 --> 11:40.228
Leslie, be nice.

11:40.332 --> 11:42.232
- You got the hook-up?
- My girl does.

11:42.334 --> 11:45.701
We're going to meet her
at the Warwick Hotel. You want to roll?

11:45.805 --> 11:48.501
- You don't mind, do you?
- Nah, do your thing.

11:48.607 --> 11:50.302
- I'll have them drop me off, okay?
- All right.

12:06.792 --> 12:09.818
I mean, if we gonna have a charity,
I need to be around the kids more.

12:09.929 --> 12:11.191
That's the whole gist.

12:11.297 --> 12:13.561
I want to talk to the kids.
I need to be in their faces.

12:13.666 --> 12:15.793
I need to see what they're thinking.

12:15.901 --> 12:18.734
That's what it's always been about for me.

12:18.838 --> 12:21.534
I mean, come on,
what else should it be for?

12:25.845 --> 12:28.609
I can't find the button
to put gas in this thing, man.

12:28.714 --> 12:31.114
This is... This is getting ridiculous.

12:31.617 --> 12:34.347
Nah, I'm...
You should talk to my mom about that.

12:34.453 --> 12:37.047
- She's running the charity, okay?
- You...

12:37.156 --> 12:38.487
- I think you...
- Excuse me. Miss?

12:38.591 --> 12:40.786
- Leslie.
- Let me call you back.

12:41.460 --> 12:42.893
Leslie, right?

12:42.995 --> 12:46.988
Yeah, Leslie Wright, with a "W."
These cars usually don't have a...

12:48.601 --> 12:51.764
A button. And you might want
to spin it around.

12:51.871 --> 12:52.963
Okay, Leslie Wright.

12:53.072 --> 12:55.563
Smells like it's fresh off the assembly line.
You just get it?

12:55.674 --> 12:58.472
Yeah. Thanks, though, I appreciate it.

12:58.577 --> 13:01.637
Well, you can thank me
by winning the championship.

13:01.747 --> 13:03.612
Oh, you really a die-hard, huh?

13:03.716 --> 13:05.650
Red and blue runs through my veins.

13:05.751 --> 13:06.979
You sound like me.

13:07.086 --> 13:09.350
I'm a Jersey girl. Gotta represent.

13:10.589 --> 13:12.716
- All right.
- You know, l...

13:12.825 --> 13:14.383
- I shouldn't.
- What?

13:14.493 --> 13:16.358
- I shouldn't, no.
- What were you gonna say?

13:16.462 --> 13:18.896
I'm sorry, I'm a little nosy and forgive me,

13:18.998 --> 13:23.196
but I couldn't help but notice
a Joni Mitchell CD sitting on your seat.

13:25.204 --> 13:27.570
Okay, yeah, I like Joni Mitchell.

13:27.673 --> 13:29.334
- Really?
- Actually, I really love jazz.

13:29.441 --> 13:30.931
That's my thing.

13:31.277 --> 13:33.973
You know that song
Joni Mitchell did with...

13:35.080 --> 13:37.310
- Charles Mingus.
- Oh, yeah, I love that one.

13:37.416 --> 13:39.247
Yeah, that's a bad record.

13:39.351 --> 13:41.410
- Okay, you have a good night.
- I better get home.

13:41.520 --> 13:43.511
You know what, let me get your door.

13:43.622 --> 13:46.420
I never figured you
for the opening door type.

13:46.525 --> 13:50.120
Come on, I open doors, I offer my coat,
I pull chairs out.

13:50.229 --> 13:52.094
I try to open... What's up with...

13:52.198 --> 13:54.063
Just lift it and pull.

13:54.867 --> 13:57.028
There you go. She's kind of old.

14:02.007 --> 14:03.941
- Good night.
- Good night.

14:04.844 --> 14:06.812
- Oh, my God.
- You know what?

14:07.847 --> 14:09.940
You got plans Saturday night?

14:15.688 --> 14:17.713
Girl, I did not expect
to be out all night,

14:17.823 --> 14:20.724
but after the Warwick,
we got invited to this after-hours,

14:20.826 --> 14:23.556
and Q-Tip was DJ-ing
and then we went to this breakfast spot,

14:23.662 --> 14:26.961
but you know I don't eat in public,
so I am starving.

14:28.267 --> 14:33.102
So, you and your girls make any progress
getting into Scott McKnight's party?

14:33.205 --> 14:34.263
I wish.

14:34.373 --> 14:37.069
Saturday night, I'll be right here with you,
putting on a second coat.

14:37.176 --> 14:39.201
- That's too bad.
- Too bad?

14:39.511 --> 14:41.809
Because if you're at this house,

14:42.248 --> 14:44.614
then you won't be at this house!

14:44.717 --> 14:46.048
- ls this...
- Yes!

14:47.419 --> 14:48.909
- Yes! At Scott McKnight's party!
- What?

14:49.021 --> 14:50.921
- I got the hook-up.
- How? How?

14:51.023 --> 14:52.786
Scott personally invited me.

14:52.892 --> 14:54.792
Okay, since when do you know
Scott McKnight?

14:54.894 --> 14:57.522
Since last night at the gas station.
Okay, boom,

14:57.630 --> 14:59.154
first of all, he's on the phone.

14:59.265 --> 15:01.460
He's beefing with somebody
about this charity event

15:01.567 --> 15:03.228
and how they better get it right
for the kids.

15:03.335 --> 15:07.328
Meanwhile, he's so distracted,
he can't even open up the gas tank.

15:08.407 --> 15:09.931
Until I hooked him up.

15:10.042 --> 15:11.509
So, what was he like?

15:11.644 --> 15:14.636
I mean, look, he was different
than I thought he would be.

15:14.747 --> 15:17.113
He was... He was cool.

15:17.616 --> 15:21.575
You know, he was... He was nice,
he was beyond nice. He was a gentleman.

15:23.322 --> 15:25.620
I mean, like a real sweetie-pie.

15:26.225 --> 15:28.785
You're not feeling this dude, are you?

15:29.895 --> 15:34.059
Girl, you crazy.
I don't do ball players. I like regular guys.

15:34.500 --> 15:37.560
Oh, my God, I gotta figure out
what outfit I'm gonna wear.

15:37.770 --> 15:39.704
Leslie, you're the best.

15:39.805 --> 15:43.172
Okay, keep your eyes closed, there you go.

15:45.010 --> 15:46.637
There, finished.

15:46.745 --> 15:48.645
- Yeah. Damn.
- Right?

15:48.747 --> 15:51.113
Didn't I tell you this color
would look fabulous on you?

15:51.216 --> 15:52.478
Nice going.

15:52.618 --> 15:55.951
- Oh, but you need more blush.
- You do.

15:56.055 --> 15:57.613
- Ma, I don't need any more...
- Yes, you do. Yes.

15:57.723 --> 16:00.817
- Mom, I do not need any more blush.
- Listen to your mother.

16:00.926 --> 16:04.555
You are going to find a husband tonight.

16:05.831 --> 16:07.799
- Okay, that does look nice.
- Yes, it does.

16:07.900 --> 16:11.734
Baby, I bagged your father 36 years ago,
and he still can't believe his luck.

16:13.005 --> 16:14.029
Okay.

16:14.139 --> 16:15.106
Oh, oh. Oh.

16:16.141 --> 16:18.405
I have a surprise.

16:19.979 --> 16:22.709
- Are those...
- Your grandmother's diamond earrings.

16:22.848 --> 16:24.839
She wore them the night
she met your grandfather,

16:24.950 --> 16:27.475
and I wore them the night
I met your father.

16:27.586 --> 16:29.144
They're beautiful, Aunt J.

16:29.254 --> 16:32.553
They are more than beautiful.
These are better than a full moon.

16:32.658 --> 16:35.923
You wear these
and men will be falling at your feet.

16:36.862 --> 16:39.922
Now, Leslie, I know that
you don't like this flashy style,

16:40.032 --> 16:43.058
but I do want one of you
to wear these tonight.

16:44.203 --> 16:45.192
Me?

16:46.138 --> 16:48.470
Really? Oh, my God.

16:49.341 --> 16:50.740
- Really?
- Yes.

16:50.876 --> 16:51.934
Okay.

16:57.316 --> 16:58.943
What do you think?

16:59.051 --> 17:01.884
- I think I'm gonna go get dressed.
- Well, make sure you wear a dress.

17:05.958 --> 17:08.756
Listen,
it's all about the law of attraction.

17:08.961 --> 17:10.826
Okay, I'm all for that.

17:11.763 --> 17:14.858
- You look amazing, baby girl.
- Thank you, Daddy.

17:19.671 --> 17:23.266
- The Deuce and a Quarter?
- Every princess needs a chariot.

17:24.309 --> 17:26.607
Thank God 'cause I was not about to go
in that Mustang.

17:26.712 --> 17:28.179
Daddy, you are too fly!

17:28.280 --> 17:30.271
Yeah, yeah, I'm the man.

17:30.382 --> 17:32.646
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

17:32.751 --> 17:35.083
Hey, watch the potholes
and don't break too many hearts.

17:35.687 --> 17:37.279
Maybe one or two.

17:38.957 --> 17:40.219
I'm so excited.

17:40.325 --> 17:41.917
- Bye, Daddy.
- Bye!

17:54.773 --> 17:57.139
Oh, my God. This is...

18:01.447 --> 18:03.677
I hope it never end
Wanna stay here

18:03.782 --> 18:05.613
Where we stand, it's so clear

18:05.717 --> 18:08.777
For a long time
In the wrong line, in the wrong crowd

18:08.887 --> 18:10.752
I don 't know how
That was no good

18:11.023 --> 18:12.820
I'd like to propose a toast

18:12.925 --> 18:14.256
- to the birthday boy.
- Oh, my God.

18:18.897 --> 18:21.127
I'm sure you've all heard this before,

18:21.233 --> 18:24.134
that some people become rich and famous
and they change.

18:24.236 --> 18:26.261
- Of course they do.
- Whatever, Angelo.

18:26.371 --> 18:28.464
The point is, I can tell you all first-hand

18:28.574 --> 18:30.940
that more often than not,
that notion is true.

18:32.111 --> 18:33.874
And then there's this guy right here,

18:33.979 --> 18:37.380
who's not only the best friend
anyone can ever hope for,

18:37.483 --> 18:40.213
but he's also the same person he was
back in high school,

18:40.319 --> 18:42.913
minus the Cross Colours and the Gumby.

18:45.023 --> 18:48.288
He's a gentleman, a true gentleman
on and off the court.

18:48.393 --> 18:52.955
- To my one and only client, happy birthday.
- Yo, brother.

18:55.167 --> 18:57.032
To the Nets! To the Nets, baby!

18:57.136 --> 18:58.160
Yeah!

19:01.473 --> 19:03.236
I'm gonna go explore, okay?

19:03.342 --> 19:06.038
- Okay, I'll meet you at that other bar.
- Okay.

19:07.946 --> 19:09.038
All right, who's doing shots?

19:09.148 --> 19:10.706
- Who's doing shots?
- Who's doing shots?

19:18.991 --> 19:21.221
Hi. Can I have a glass
of champagne, please?

19:21.326 --> 19:22.384
Sure.

19:24.496 --> 19:26.691
- Leslie Wright. What up? You made it.
- Hey.

19:26.798 --> 19:28.959
- Hey. What's up?
- Happy birthday.

19:29.067 --> 19:30.534
How you doing?

19:31.670 --> 19:33.661
- I got you a card.
- That's sweet, thank you.

19:33.772 --> 19:35.637
No money in it, though.

19:37.476 --> 19:40.070
- You look great.
- Thank you. So do you.

19:40.846 --> 19:42.313
Appreciate it.

19:43.448 --> 19:46.349
Your house.
Your house is just so beautiful.

19:46.451 --> 19:48.578
I'm glad you think so.

19:48.687 --> 19:51.747
I wish I could take the credit for it,
but I had a lot of help.

19:51.890 --> 19:55.724
If it was up to me, there'd be futons,
flat screens in every room.

19:55.827 --> 19:58.819
- Well, it's a palace compared to my place.
- Yeah?

19:58.931 --> 20:00.489
I just bought this fixer-upper.

20:00.599 --> 20:01.861
My father's helping me out,

20:01.967 --> 20:04.527
but he's not quite the handyman
he thinks he is.

20:04.636 --> 20:07.230
Girl, I am so sorry, but I can't stay.

20:07.339 --> 20:09.830
- What?
- Yeah, I just got a call from Safe Horizon.

20:09.942 --> 20:11.375
They need me.

20:13.579 --> 20:16.673
Scott, this is Morgan, this is
my god sister. We grew up together.

20:16.782 --> 20:19.012
- Hi. Nice to meet you.
- Hey. How you doing?

20:19.117 --> 20:21.085
You can't leave this party.
It just got started.

20:21.186 --> 20:24.713
I have to. One of the volunteers
at the homeless shelter I help out at

20:24.823 --> 20:27.348
just called in sick, so it's urgent.

20:27.459 --> 20:31.452
Bartender, can I trade this in
for a Hennessy? Double.

20:31.563 --> 20:33.292
- You got it.
- Thank you.

20:33.398 --> 20:35.366
You know, I volunteer
at different spots myself.

20:35.467 --> 20:36.695
- Yeah?
- I wish I had more time

20:36.802 --> 20:38.030
to do it, though, you know?

20:38.136 --> 20:40.696
Oh, I got to stop back at the house
and get some games for the kids, okay?

20:40.806 --> 20:42.137
So, you two live together?

20:42.241 --> 20:44.106
- Temporarily.
- It's a long story.

20:44.209 --> 20:45.471
How can I get in touch with you?

20:45.577 --> 20:48.011
Oh, Scott... It's Scott, right?

20:48.547 --> 20:51.948
I'm sorry. I've tried the whole
dating-a-ball-player thing,

20:52.050 --> 20:55.315
and it's not for me.
But it was really nice talking to you.

20:55.420 --> 20:56.717
You ready?

20:57.089 --> 20:58.215
Am I ready?

20:58.323 --> 20:59.950
- Y'all out?
- Yeah.

21:00.359 --> 21:02.020
- Happy birthday.
- Thanks.

21:02.127 --> 21:04.220
Thank you for inviting me.
Enjoy your birthday.

21:04.329 --> 21:06.058
- Y'all get home safe.
- Thank you.

21:06.832 --> 21:09.995
You know, the objective is not to make
them leave. How'd you mess that up?

21:10.102 --> 21:11.660
I ain't mess nothing up.

21:13.138 --> 21:16.107
- You so owe me.
- I'll so make it up to you.

21:16.208 --> 21:18.301
Was he looking at me
when I walked away?

21:18.410 --> 21:21.174
Yeah. I mean, a volunteer from a shelter?

21:21.280 --> 21:23.908
Well, you said he was different,
so I gave him different.

21:24.016 --> 21:25.040
The girl next door?

21:25.150 --> 21:27.141
The girl that'll be living
in this big-ass house.

21:27.252 --> 21:29.379
I'm bagging this one, girl, I can feel it!

21:29.488 --> 21:32.218
Wait a minute, you didn't even give him
your number when he asked you for it.

21:32.324 --> 21:35.020
Yeah, which is probably the first time
a woman's done that to him

21:35.127 --> 21:36.890
since he got to the NBA.

21:36.995 --> 21:38.929
Trust me, I'll be hearing from him.

21:40.599 --> 21:42.226
- Here we go.
- Okay.

21:55.814 --> 21:56.872
What?

21:58.483 --> 22:01.213
The new windows are in.
Light fixtures are next.

22:01.320 --> 22:03.379
Wow, Daddy, you were right.

22:03.955 --> 22:05.479
It does make a huge difference.

22:05.590 --> 22:07.956
What'd I tell you, I got this, girl.

22:08.393 --> 22:10.418
Oh, oh, uh, how was last night?

22:11.363 --> 22:12.489
I knew it.

22:12.597 --> 22:14.428
Your prince saw you and bam! He hit the...

22:14.533 --> 22:17.331
And then he saw Morgan
and forgot I was even there.

22:18.537 --> 22:23.099
But, hey, I'm used to it.
I mean, why wouldn't he? She is beautiful.

22:26.244 --> 22:27.643
You're beautiful.

22:28.580 --> 22:31.413
Oh, Daddy.
That's why all the really great guys

22:31.516 --> 22:33.177
think I make the perfect friend.

22:34.119 --> 22:37.088
It'll happen, you just got to give it time.

22:37.189 --> 22:39.589
When, Daddy? I'm 35 years old.

22:39.691 --> 22:42.023
I mean, when am I gonna meet
that one amazing guy

22:42.127 --> 22:45.096
who thinks I'm the one woman
he can't live without?

22:52.237 --> 22:53.932
He's out there, huh?

22:54.039 --> 22:58.533
Okay. Well, when you find him,
I'll be at work.

22:58.877 --> 23:00.276
There you go.

23:00.979 --> 23:02.571
And make sure he got all his teeth.

23:02.881 --> 23:04.712
You got it.

23:06.585 --> 23:07.745
Daddy?

23:10.856 --> 23:12.847
Just needs a little tweak.

23:21.199 --> 23:23.064
Just a little tweaking.

23:24.403 --> 23:25.961
You do live here.

23:27.172 --> 23:29.606
I was thinking
I might have the wrong house.

23:29.708 --> 23:32.006
Hi. How'd you know I live here?

23:32.310 --> 23:33.777
I know people.

23:34.112 --> 23:35.943
Scott McKnight!

23:37.215 --> 23:41.242
- How you doing? How you doing, sir?
- I'm good... Hey, how you doing?

23:42.621 --> 23:43.883
How are you?

23:43.989 --> 23:46.287
- Oh, this is my dad.
- Lloyd. Lloyd.

23:46.391 --> 23:48.291
What are you doing here?

23:48.393 --> 23:50.418
I was hoping to see Morgan.

23:52.230 --> 23:54.721
Well, don't you just stand there,
come on in.

23:59.438 --> 24:00.632
Morgan?

24:03.275 --> 24:06.267
I'm sorry. Forgot that was like that.

24:09.881 --> 24:10.939
Morg!

24:11.383 --> 24:12.441
What?

24:13.518 --> 24:14.849
Come on in.

24:15.787 --> 24:16.947
Morgan!

24:17.622 --> 24:18.680
What?

24:19.491 --> 24:21.186
You have a visitor.

24:30.101 --> 24:32.865
Oh, my God. Coming.

24:33.705 --> 24:36.367
- This is a nice house.
- Well, thank you.

24:36.875 --> 24:38.467
It smells like you've been doing
some painting.

24:39.177 --> 24:41.907
Yeah, I guess...
I guess I could open up a window, huh?

24:48.820 --> 24:50.048
You okay?

24:50.455 --> 24:51.717
Sorry.

24:51.823 --> 24:53.381
It needs just a tweak.

24:53.959 --> 24:54.926
Okay. Oh...

24:55.627 --> 24:56.821
Breathe.

25:00.131 --> 25:02.292
You know, I gotta get
to Home Depot, yeah.

25:04.236 --> 25:05.828
- Get a "W" tonight.
- Yes, sir.

25:06.071 --> 25:07.129
Okay.

25:12.077 --> 25:14.944
- Let me go get Morgan for you.
- Okay.

25:15.981 --> 25:17.039
Morg!

25:18.383 --> 25:19.407
Just a second.

25:22.554 --> 25:23.851
I'll be right there.

25:29.995 --> 25:31.019
What do you do?

25:31.162 --> 25:34.563
Oh! I am the chief physical therapist
at a rehabilitation center.

25:34.866 --> 25:35.958
You must be good.

25:36.067 --> 25:37.659
Yeah. I've been doing it 12 years.

25:37.869 --> 25:39.200
Could do it in my sleep.

25:39.304 --> 25:42.569
But I like to stay up
on the latest information, so the books.

25:43.174 --> 25:44.471
Very cool.

25:45.377 --> 25:46.867
Scott McKnight?

25:47.946 --> 25:49.072
What are you doing here?

25:49.180 --> 25:52.741
I know I only talked to you
for a couple of minutes at the party,

25:52.851 --> 25:54.318
but I just had to see you again.

25:59.658 --> 26:02.092
- I'm headed to work, girl. I'm late.
- Okay.

26:02.193 --> 26:03.455
- Nice seeing you. Call me.
- Bye.

26:03.562 --> 26:04.586
Bye.

26:06.531 --> 26:09.762
I have an away game tonight.
I'll be back tomorrow.

26:10.502 --> 26:11.526
Have dinner with me?

26:11.870 --> 26:15.897
Scott, it's like I told you at the party.

26:16.875 --> 26:19.935
- I've done this before, and...
- But not with me.

26:20.445 --> 26:22.936
- But you don't even know me.
- I want to know you.

26:23.048 --> 26:24.037
I don't even know you.

26:24.149 --> 26:27.243
Leslie does. She'll vouch for me.
I'm a perfect gentleman.

26:31.289 --> 26:32.654
Just dinner?

26:33.959 --> 26:35.324
Just dinner.

26:38.129 --> 26:40.893
Now usually,
I don't really rave about jewelry

26:40.999 --> 26:43.991
It's foolery, but something
about the way you look on my arm

26:44.102 --> 26:46.036
And all on my neck
like you're my charm

26:46.171 --> 26:47.832
So, so fresh when we step out midnight

26:47.939 --> 26:50.339
Up in the spot we chillin ', sit tight

26:50.442 --> 26:51.909
Now when I'm gone
you can be gone with me

26:52.010 --> 26:54.171
If you don 't go,
damn right, you miss me

26:54.279 --> 26:57.942
I wanna fly, fly, fly
through the moonlit skies

26:58.049 --> 27:01.041
Into the sunset
on the shores of another land

27:01.152 --> 27:02.210
Y eah!

27:02.320 --> 27:04.151
And I want you by my side

27:04.255 --> 27:05.984
I'm asking, don 't know why

27:06.091 --> 27:09.026
I can 't tell by your smile
you're the tra veling kind of man

27:10.996 --> 27:14.693
Your lips won 't quit

27:14.799 --> 27:18.565
They keep me rockin ' in kiss after kiss

27:19.270 --> 27:22.706
Your smile, so wild

27:22.807 --> 27:26.470
So sweet and coy
It's just like a child

27:26.578 --> 27:29.138
We can keep going, JFK to wherever

27:29.247 --> 27:31.044
We can fly to any type of weather

27:31.149 --> 27:33.640
But from what I see,
you better be here with me

27:33.985 --> 27:34.952
Come on, Scott!

27:35.120 --> 27:36.951
But that don 't mean that I can 't focus

27:37.055 --> 27:38.716
Especially if I think you the dopest

27:38.823 --> 27:41.223
Maybe one day we could see what happens

27:41.326 --> 27:42.623
Let's keep it classic

27:42.727 --> 27:46.527
I wanna fly, fly, fly
through the moonlit skies

27:46.631 --> 27:49.998
Into the sunset
on the shores of another land

27:50.101 --> 27:53.195
I wanna fly, fly, fly...

28:04.249 --> 28:06.308
- What's up?
- You made it!

28:08.119 --> 28:09.108
It's the only way I'm gonna see you.

28:09.220 --> 28:10.619
- It's been, like, three months.
- I know.

28:10.722 --> 28:13.213
- Look at your hair.
- Scott hates weaves.

28:13.324 --> 28:16.691
- Well, that's different.
- Come on, let me show you around.

28:16.795 --> 28:18.092
Isn't it incredible?

28:18.196 --> 28:20.858
Yeah, girl, it's like you been on tour,
like you play for the Nets.

28:20.965 --> 28:22.296
Well, I gotta stay close to my man.

28:22.400 --> 28:24.265
I mean, these women out here
are treacherous.

28:24.369 --> 28:26.735
- I hear that.
- You have no idea.

28:26.838 --> 28:28.203
Anyways, let's go upstairs,

28:28.306 --> 28:29.933
and I want to show you around,
give you a tour.

28:31.943 --> 28:34.207
And this is the master bedroom.

28:35.814 --> 28:36.781
Wow.

28:36.881 --> 28:39.349
And we're thinking
about putting the nursery over here,

28:39.451 --> 28:41.919
- so the baby can be close...
- Baby? Are you pregnant?

28:42.153 --> 28:45.054
Oh, no, but we plan to start
a family right away.

28:45.824 --> 28:47.655
Morgan, you've known Scott
for, like, three seconds.

28:47.759 --> 28:49.283
Already you trying to get pregnant?

28:49.394 --> 28:52.022
We're in love.
And when you're in love, you know,

28:52.597 --> 28:54.292
you get married. You start a family.

28:54.766 --> 28:56.199
You? In love?

28:57.502 --> 28:59.197
He changed me, Leslie.

28:59.537 --> 29:03.940
I know it's hard to believe,
but he made me want to be a better me.

29:04.609 --> 29:08.136
Morg, this is me you're talking to,
remember? I know you.

29:08.580 --> 29:11.048
Look, I'll admit it, okay.

29:12.217 --> 29:13.514
I went after Scott
for all the wrong reasons.

29:13.618 --> 29:14.607
Mmm-hmm.

29:14.719 --> 29:17.187
But he got inside my heart.

29:20.792 --> 29:22.282
You're serious?

29:22.761 --> 29:24.388
- You happy for me?
- Of course.

29:24.496 --> 29:26.828
Well, let me show you
the rest of the house.

29:27.599 --> 29:30.466
Wow. So this is how y'all been living, huh?

29:30.835 --> 29:33.201
- What's that?
- Oh! No idea.

29:33.338 --> 29:36.000
It's Scott's personal space and off-limits.

29:36.107 --> 29:38.200
I just hope he's not into anything weird,
you know.

29:38.309 --> 29:40.140
'Cause always the brothers
with the secret rooms

29:40.245 --> 29:41.735
you gotta worry about.

29:41.846 --> 29:44.440
Yeah, I heard about them secret rooms.

29:47.886 --> 29:50.013
Can I have your attention,
everybody?

29:50.121 --> 29:52.681
Hey, take the music down.
Take it down, everybody.

29:53.691 --> 29:55.022
Take it down.

29:55.126 --> 29:57.617
First, I want to thank everyone
for coming out,

29:57.729 --> 30:02.291
helping me celebrate being voted
to represent the East in the All-Star Game.

30:03.034 --> 30:04.763
Five years in a row!

30:07.005 --> 30:09.303
I have a lot to be thankful for.

30:09.941 --> 30:11.033
Great friends.

30:12.677 --> 30:13.644
Great mom.

30:15.914 --> 30:18.041
And the icing on the cake,

30:18.149 --> 30:20.845
thanks to some trouble at a gas station,

30:22.520 --> 30:25.921
I'm getting to wake up next to
the most beautiful woman on the planet.

30:26.925 --> 30:30.053
And with so many of my good friends
here tonight,

30:30.795 --> 30:34.026
I thought what better moment
than to ask the woman I love...

30:39.604 --> 30:40.935
Oh, my God.

30:47.178 --> 30:51.114
- Morgan Nicole Alexander, will you...
- Yes! Yes, I'll marry you!

30:52.717 --> 30:53.945
Oh, baby.

30:54.652 --> 30:56.176
Oh.

30:58.923 --> 30:59.947
Wow.

31:09.434 --> 31:10.662
See that?

31:14.372 --> 31:15.737
Oh, my God!

31:16.274 --> 31:19.334
Mom. We're going to be a family.

31:22.447 --> 31:24.278
Honestly, man, congratulations.

31:24.382 --> 31:27.681
I mean, you did well. She is gorgeous.
Like, l...

31:29.988 --> 31:31.046
Thanks, man.

31:31.322 --> 31:33.950
- I know you want me to be your best man.
- Yeah, okay.

31:34.225 --> 31:36.022
- I'm serious. I mean, I mean...
- Angelo.

31:37.362 --> 31:39.455
- Would you excuse us?
- Yes, ma'am.

31:39.564 --> 31:42.260
Gotta go check on the wife anyway.
All right, brother, congrats.

31:42.367 --> 31:44.733
Thanks. I'll see you in a minute.

31:46.971 --> 31:50.407
- I know. I know.
- What do you know?

31:50.508 --> 31:54.535
- I should have told you before, but I just...
- Why? You're a grown man.

31:54.646 --> 31:57.046
Grown men do what they want to do.

31:58.149 --> 32:01.641
But you're still my baby, so I need to ask.

32:02.487 --> 32:03.715
Anything.

32:04.355 --> 32:06.846
You sure you're not moving too fast?

32:07.759 --> 32:10.057
You've only known her a little while.

32:10.528 --> 32:11.927
She's different, Ma.

32:12.897 --> 32:14.159
Ah.

32:14.265 --> 32:17.530
Really. She's very special.

32:18.469 --> 32:19.766
Mmm?

32:20.405 --> 32:22.134
Don't worry so much.

32:24.309 --> 32:25.776
Can you be happy for me?

32:29.080 --> 32:30.377
Come here.

32:32.283 --> 32:33.250
Mmm.

32:36.654 --> 32:38.519
We welcome you to the lzod Center,

32:38.623 --> 32:41.820
as we get ready
for the NBA All-Star Game.

32:41.926 --> 32:44.053
Hi, everybody, Marv Albert,
Kenny "The Jet" Smith,

32:44.162 --> 32:45.595
"The Czar" Mike Fratello,

32:45.897 --> 32:48.957
and we are just moments away
from the opening tip-off.

32:49.067 --> 32:51.058
The stars of stars are right here
in this building.

32:51.169 --> 32:53.069
You have the premiere center,
Dwight Howard,

32:53.171 --> 32:54.661
prolific scorer, Dwyane Wade.

32:54.806 --> 32:57.775
But the majority of the people here
want to see Scott McKnight.

33:00.511 --> 33:02.570
You're unbelievable

33:09.253 --> 33:11.244
And you're so unbelievable

33:18.830 --> 33:21.492
I just wanna make jams
To pack the clubs 'n ' stadiums

33:21.599 --> 33:24.659
With people of all types
While makin ' the crowd hype

33:24.769 --> 33:28.899
Five minutes left in
the fourth quarter and the East is up by 12.

33:29.340 --> 33:31.365
Well, they gotta go
to McKnight. He's been killing.

33:31.476 --> 33:33.637
Twenty-six points,
- eight assists, four steals.

33:33.745 --> 33:34.837
He's been phenomenal.

33:38.783 --> 33:42.048
Here's McKnight,
off the spin... And he's down.

33:43.688 --> 33:44.950
Looks like a knee.

33:45.056 --> 33:47.923
That doesn't look good.
Marv, I think that's hurt.

33:48.026 --> 33:49.152
He's hurt... He's hurt for real.

33:49.260 --> 33:51.592
Yo, Scott. Scott, you all right?

33:51.696 --> 33:52.993
He may have hit
a wet spot.

33:53.097 --> 33:54.997
I don't like the way that knee buckled.

33:55.099 --> 33:57.932
Let me tell you, generally,
guys don't get up from injuries like this.

33:58.202 --> 34:00.602
I hate to say it.
It doesn't look like he's gonna get up.

34:00.705 --> 34:02.195
Scott! Come on.

34:08.045 --> 34:09.672
Come on, baby, get up!

34:09.981 --> 34:11.710
You'll be all right.

34:14.118 --> 34:16.882
- ls he gonna be all right?
- I don't know. I don't know.

34:18.989 --> 34:20.924
Come on, Scott. Come on.

34:33.337 --> 34:35.396
- Hi.
- What's the story, Dr. Taylor?

34:35.840 --> 34:39.297
Well, you suffered
a torn posterior cruciate ligament,

34:39.409 --> 34:43.369
which is one of four ligaments
critical to the stability of the knee.

34:43.481 --> 34:45.676
With some hard work
and a little bit of luck,

34:45.783 --> 34:47.148
we might have you back in action
by training camp.

34:47.251 --> 34:49.310
Training camp?
No, we're in contract negotiations.

34:49.420 --> 34:51.047
I gotta have him ready for the Playoffs.

34:54.659 --> 34:55.887
Look, you need to be prepared

34:55.993 --> 34:58.689
for the possibility
that Scott's NBA career could be over.

34:58.796 --> 35:01.196
- There's just no way to be certain.
- His career could be over?

35:01.299 --> 35:02.823
If rehab doesn't work,

35:02.934 --> 35:05.528
there's no way he can play in the NBA
on an unstable knee.

35:05.636 --> 35:07.934
He needs to begin
rehabilitation immediately,

35:08.039 --> 35:09.472
and I mean aggressively.

35:13.678 --> 35:16.078
- You okay, baby?
- Easy, easy. Here you go.

35:16.180 --> 35:18.171
- Careful.
- So, I got a physical therapist

35:18.282 --> 35:20.216
- coming by the house tomorrow.
- I hope he's good.

35:20.318 --> 35:22.081
No, it's a she. Bella Goldsmith.

35:22.186 --> 35:24.848
Tim said she specializes in sports injuries.

35:24.956 --> 35:26.981
Bella Goldsmith,
she's the best in the league.

35:27.091 --> 35:30.549
Yeah, they call her "The Miracle Worker."
We're not leaving anything to chance.

35:30.661 --> 35:31.923
- Good.
- I'll call you later.

35:32.029 --> 35:33.621
- Morgan, you take good care of him.
- All right.

35:33.731 --> 35:35.221
- You'll have your phone on, right?
- Always. Always.

35:35.333 --> 35:37.528
Okay. Take it slow, baby.

35:53.985 --> 35:56.044
- This is your lT band here.
- Mmm-hmm.

35:56.154 --> 35:59.453
So you really want to stretch this,
maybe foam a little.

35:59.557 --> 36:00.615
Okay.

36:01.058 --> 36:02.787
- Hey, baby.
- Hey.

36:03.528 --> 36:06.691
Hey, this is Bella Goldsmith,
The Miracle Worker.

36:06.797 --> 36:09.698
- I don't know about all that. Hi.
- Hi.

36:09.800 --> 36:11.700
- Bella.
- Morgan, his fiancee.

36:14.405 --> 36:17.272
So, I have a romantic dinner
planned for us.

36:18.075 --> 36:19.975
And then we can do
whatever you want afterwards, okay?

36:20.811 --> 36:23.746
- Yeah. We'll figure it out.
- Hip down.

36:25.082 --> 36:27.550
- Breathe.
- Well, I'll leave you guys to it.

36:27.652 --> 36:29.051
- Yeah, that feels good, right there.
- All right.

36:29.153 --> 36:31.053
I'll just...

36:33.391 --> 36:36.758
I can do this for you,
but you have to do it on your own, too.

36:37.094 --> 36:38.391
All right.

36:43.668 --> 36:44.760
Relax.

36:46.270 --> 36:47.498
There we go.

36:56.647 --> 36:59.047
Leslie, if you could have seen this girl.

36:59.150 --> 37:01.983
Bella Goldsmith is
one of the most respected people in this...

37:02.086 --> 37:03.519
If I hear that one more time...

37:03.621 --> 37:06.920
Look, some women have gay-dar.
I've got ho-dar.

37:07.024 --> 37:09.219
And I don't care how respected she is.

37:09.327 --> 37:12.057
He's up in the family room.
The job is basically yours.

37:12.763 --> 37:14.424
Nelson already cleared it with the Nets.

37:15.266 --> 37:16.324
You're not staying?

37:17.935 --> 37:19.334
Charity event.

37:19.670 --> 37:20.659
Oh!

37:20.771 --> 37:22.966
Scott's mother's here. Be prepared.

37:23.074 --> 37:24.769
The woman's a pill.

37:25.409 --> 37:26.376
Good luck!

37:37.455 --> 37:38.717
Because of that speed, Marv,

37:38.823 --> 37:41.314
it's very difficult
to keep him in front ofyou.

37:41.425 --> 37:44.360
So defenders really have
to try to be physical with him

37:44.462 --> 37:46.020
and they frequently pick up fouls.

37:49.000 --> 37:49.967
Not good.

37:51.335 --> 37:52.597
Hey, I didn't even know you were here.

37:52.703 --> 37:55.137
You know, having your leg
bent like that and not elevated

37:55.239 --> 37:57.036
while you're chilling at home
is the worst thing you could do

37:57.141 --> 37:59.200
for a torn PCL.
Didn't your doctor tell you that?

37:59.343 --> 38:01.402
- Yeah.
- And where is your ice pack?

38:01.512 --> 38:03.104
Here, let's get this up.

38:06.851 --> 38:08.876
Easy. There we go.

38:09.420 --> 38:11.888
- ls that better?
- Yeah, that's a lot better.

38:12.490 --> 38:14.583
Morgan told you the job's full-time, right?

38:14.792 --> 38:15.850
Full-time, live-in,

38:15.960 --> 38:17.655
and my boss is cool with me
taking a leave of absence,

38:17.762 --> 38:19.161
so we're good to go.

38:19.330 --> 38:20.388
Baby?

38:20.898 --> 38:23.128
Baby, they keep calling
from the office... Hi.

38:23.668 --> 38:25.158
- Hi.
- They keep calling from the office, honey.

38:25.369 --> 38:27.462
They want to know about that game
where you broke all the records.

38:27.738 --> 38:30.605
You should know that, Ma.
You're the president of my fan club.

38:30.841 --> 38:34.743
You must be talking about
Randolph versus MLK, 1993?

38:35.446 --> 38:38.472
Sophomore year,
he scored 23 points in the first half,

38:38.582 --> 38:41.642
another 32 in the second half,
18 rebounds,

38:42.019 --> 38:44.954
10 assists, nine steals,
breaking the high school record

38:45.056 --> 38:46.819
for double digits in a single game.

38:49.827 --> 38:52.694
I've been a basketball fan
since before I could walk, so.

38:54.332 --> 38:57.062
When you finish with him,
come to the fan club. We could use you.

38:59.470 --> 39:00.767
You play bid whist?

39:02.173 --> 39:04.141
Neighborhood champ, six years running.

39:05.276 --> 39:06.504
So what're you saying?

39:07.511 --> 39:11.743
I'm saying, with all due respect, Miss Ella,
you don't want none of this.

39:12.750 --> 39:13.944
Oh.

39:14.285 --> 39:15.252
I like her.

39:16.087 --> 39:18.385
I might have to teach her a little
something something, but I like her.

39:22.626 --> 39:24.685
So, when will this knee be
working again?

39:24.962 --> 39:26.953
Well, you gotta give it time to heal.

39:27.131 --> 39:29.156
(GROANS) It hurts.

39:29.266 --> 39:31.131
I've seen you take an elbow
from Dwyane Wade

39:31.235 --> 39:33.135
and you can't take a little deep tissue?

39:33.537 --> 39:34.595
You didn't tear your knee.

39:36.040 --> 39:37.905
Wow, Scott McKnight,

39:38.008 --> 39:41.910
two-time league MVP,
guaranteed future Hall of Famer,

39:42.146 --> 39:45.445
is a big old baby in real life. Who knew?

39:48.352 --> 39:50.479
Relax. There we go.

39:50.721 --> 39:51.813
I don't believe this.

39:52.890 --> 39:55.791
All right. Okay. That should be good.

39:57.228 --> 39:58.320
There we go.

40:10.641 --> 40:11.608
Baby?

40:13.511 --> 40:15.376
- Are you okay?
- Hey. Put your weight on me.

40:15.813 --> 40:17.280
I'm all right, I'm all right.

40:18.282 --> 40:19.874
- There you go.
- Yeah.

40:19.984 --> 40:21.349
- Good?
- Yeah.

40:22.553 --> 40:24.111
I'm straight.

40:24.688 --> 40:27.179
These things take time.

40:36.133 --> 40:37.623
I can't believe Morgan got me into this.

40:37.735 --> 40:39.498
Sometimes I feel like I'm over my head.

40:39.837 --> 40:40.929
Come on, Leslie.

40:41.038 --> 40:43.529
You got your undergrad
in athletic training.

40:43.641 --> 40:45.575
You can do PT in your sleep.
What are you worried about?

40:45.876 --> 40:48.709
I have an NBA player's career in my hands.

40:50.714 --> 40:52.909
- Did you get the books?
- Yes.

40:53.050 --> 40:54.779
Everything you asked for.

40:55.419 --> 40:58.013
Yeah. All right, perfect.

40:58.122 --> 41:00.750
Here she comes now,
the most beautiful woman in the world.

41:00.858 --> 41:01.984
Just ask her.

41:02.092 --> 41:04.117
- Hi.
- Hey.

41:04.228 --> 41:05.991
Sorry I'm late, guys.

41:07.465 --> 41:08.693
Hi, Peter.

41:08.799 --> 41:11.063
- It's Paul, actually, but that's close.
- Oh.

41:11.168 --> 41:12.658
- I'm sorry. Hi, Paul.
- Hi.

41:12.770 --> 41:15.000
I'm sorry I'm late. It was just traffic

41:15.840 --> 41:16.966
and shopping.

41:17.141 --> 41:19.837
It's so much fun
to hang out with you guys, you know?

41:20.010 --> 41:22.638
All the talk about muscle conditioning
and the human body,

41:22.813 --> 41:24.440
it's like the Discovery Channel,

41:24.548 --> 41:26.209
and who doesn't like
Discovery Channel, right?

41:27.017 --> 41:28.416
You don't.

41:28.752 --> 41:30.014
- Can I get you something to drink?
- Yeah, I'll take

41:30.120 --> 41:31.644
some champagne, please, thank you.

41:33.190 --> 41:35.249
Girl, I could not stand another minute

41:35.359 --> 41:37.293
in that big house with him
doing nothing but...

41:37.394 --> 41:39.624
- Being with your man?
- Who won't hang out.

41:39.797 --> 41:41.628
Well, didn't he just tear his PCL?

41:41.732 --> 41:43.131
So he can't have fun?

41:43.234 --> 41:46.032
That's why I had to go out and do
some shopping, a little retail therapy.

41:46.604 --> 41:48.333
I got some great things.

41:49.173 --> 41:50.572
Look.

41:51.842 --> 41:55.334
- Here, Patrick. Touch it.
- Oh, I'd love to.

42:07.224 --> 42:08.953
Hey, you know this guy?

42:09.059 --> 42:10.321
Hey, World.

42:11.729 --> 42:13.458
- What you doing with this?
- What up?

42:13.564 --> 42:14.656
What, what's up?

42:14.798 --> 42:17.392
Hey, do this thing, man
Hey, hey!

42:18.569 --> 42:21.129
- How you feeling, man?
- I'm good, man. How're you?

42:21.238 --> 42:22.671
- I'm good, man.
- So, what's up, man?

42:22.806 --> 42:24.137
What you doing here?

42:24.275 --> 42:26.072
Man, I just came to do
this commercial, man,

42:26.176 --> 42:28.667
but first I had to come
check on my big homie, man.

42:28.779 --> 42:30.576
Yeah, yeah, it's getting better, man.

42:30.948 --> 42:32.142
I'm gonna be good.

42:32.249 --> 42:33.978
- Thanks to Leslie.
- That's what's up,

42:34.084 --> 42:36.780
but I really didn't come here
to talk about your leg.

42:36.887 --> 42:38.115
Well, what's up?

42:39.023 --> 42:41.924
Well, there's a rumor going around
that's saying

42:42.026 --> 42:43.425
the Nets aren't going to re-sign you.

42:44.895 --> 42:48.695
What? The Nets without Scott McKnight?

42:49.366 --> 42:51.129
No. Come on, man.

42:53.737 --> 42:55.602
I mean, I'm always gonna be a Net.

42:55.973 --> 42:58.601
- All right. That's what's up.
- Yeah, for sure.

42:58.709 --> 43:01.405
I'm good. New Jersey, baby,
we're coming to see you.

43:01.512 --> 43:03.673
- Y'all are not ready for the Magic.
- I'm gonna be ready.

43:03.781 --> 43:05.305
- You gonna be ready?
- You know who I'm gonna hand it to?

43:05.416 --> 43:06.542
- Who?
- Your boy Jameer.

43:06.650 --> 43:08.641
I don't know.
You got this pizza here and them chips.

43:08.752 --> 43:10.549
I don't think you're ready to see me
on that court, now.

43:10.654 --> 43:11.814
Yeah, you gonna see.

43:18.162 --> 43:20.357
Hey, you heard from Morgan?

43:20.531 --> 43:22.522
I've been trying to reach her all day.

43:23.000 --> 43:24.627
Last time I checked she was shopping.

43:29.206 --> 43:31.174
Hey, baby. It's me.

43:32.343 --> 43:33.310
Call me.

43:35.713 --> 43:38.204
...is McKnight still a franchise player?

43:38.382 --> 43:39.849
Turn that up.

43:41.819 --> 43:44.151
... with that kind ofinjury, the Nets,
they can 't count on him.

43:44.254 --> 43:45.812
And the last thing they need to do

43:45.923 --> 43:48.118
is pay someone
to sit on a bench for half the season.

43:48.225 --> 43:50.159
So, Golic, you think the Nets
might not re-sign

43:50.260 --> 43:51.887
Scott McKnight at all?

43:51.996 --> 43:54.658
Franchises want
to win championships.

43:54.765 --> 43:57.233
I'm sorry,
but with the kind of injury McKnight has,

43:57.334 --> 43:59.029
the Nets can 't get rings,

43:59.136 --> 44:00.967
not with him as their franchise player.

44:01.372 --> 44:04.773
His days in a Nets jersey are over
after this season.

44:05.142 --> 44:06.109
All right, let's get one...

44:13.751 --> 44:14.718
You okay?

45:09.773 --> 45:12.970
See, see, I knew there was
something about that girl.

45:13.077 --> 45:15.409
Coming up in here,
pretending to care about my son,

45:15.512 --> 45:17.241
when all she really
cared about was herself.

45:17.347 --> 45:18.609
Well, he doesn't need her.

45:18.716 --> 45:20.445
And he doesn't need you.

45:23.721 --> 45:26.281
I swear, I had no idea about this.

45:26.990 --> 45:29.550
You leaving, too? Leave now.

45:30.461 --> 45:32.486
I'm leaving, but I will be back.

45:40.170 --> 45:41.137
Yeah, right.

46:00.824 --> 46:02.416
Have you lost your damn mind?

46:03.060 --> 46:06.086
I take a leave of absence from my job
to help your man,

46:06.330 --> 46:07.524
who you just dumped,

46:07.631 --> 46:10.122
- and you don't even give me a heads up?
- I'm sorry.

46:10.300 --> 46:12.791
But how do you think I feel?

46:12.936 --> 46:14.198
I was really starting to like him.

46:14.605 --> 46:17.335
That's all you have to say?
And with a note?

46:17.508 --> 46:20.909
It was better that way. You know
he would've only tried to change my mind.

46:21.245 --> 46:23.475
Why, Morgan? Why'd you do it?

46:23.847 --> 46:26.281
- Why?
- Because I want to be somebody!

46:26.717 --> 46:27.684
Okay?

46:28.285 --> 46:30.253
And it ain't gonna happen
being the wife of some

46:30.754 --> 46:33.188
has-been player
with some bullshit contract

46:33.323 --> 46:35.188
Iiving in some podunk city.

46:35.959 --> 46:38.086
You wanted to know why, now you know.

46:38.929 --> 46:40.920
You can't possibly be this messed up.

46:42.733 --> 46:45.167
You do you, and I do me, okay?

46:45.602 --> 46:47.536
I've been watching you "do you"
your whole life.

46:47.805 --> 46:52.208
Using people, hurting them.
Discarding boyfriends like old shoes.

46:53.143 --> 46:55.304
Well, we all can't be Saint Leslie Wright.

46:57.147 --> 46:58.307
You got problems.

47:11.061 --> 47:12.221
Scott?

47:13.931 --> 47:16.092
Scott, can I come in, please?

47:17.367 --> 47:18.425
I'm coming in.

47:24.641 --> 47:28.202
Scott, from the bottom of my heart,
I'm so sorry.

47:28.312 --> 47:31.543
- Morgan didn't even...
- ls this part of your job?

47:31.648 --> 47:34.173
- No.
- Then just stick to your job.

47:53.637 --> 47:54.763
Scott.

47:56.807 --> 47:58.866
Come on, you got to eat something.

47:59.376 --> 48:01.139
I made you some food.

48:03.914 --> 48:05.381
You need to eat.

48:53.397 --> 48:56.889
...their display of
underwater art stands as a testament

48:57.000 --> 48:58.968
to the complex brilliance of even...

48:59.069 --> 49:00.161
- Baby?
- ...the simplest organisms

49:00.270 --> 49:01.237
that inhabit...

49:01.772 --> 49:03.865
Baby, Angelo's on the phone.

49:04.775 --> 49:06.743
Dwyane called twice today.

49:09.846 --> 49:10.870
...for even the carnivores...

49:10.981 --> 49:12.243
- Baby?
- ... who prey on jellyfish

49:12.950 --> 49:14.474
rely on the darkness...

49:18.221 --> 49:19.552
Well, he can't come to the phone
right now,

49:19.656 --> 49:20.918
but can I have him call you later?

49:33.603 --> 49:35.161
- What... What the...
- Get up!

49:35.272 --> 49:37.536
- Leslie, what are you doing?
- Get up. You're coming with me.

49:37.641 --> 49:39.074
What? I'm not going no...

49:40.077 --> 49:41.339
- Man...
- You coming with me!

49:41.445 --> 49:43.743
I'm not going any... Okay, okay!

49:48.852 --> 49:50.581
I gotta get dressed.

50:20.217 --> 50:24.119
No disrespect, but I really think
it's time you get a new whip.

50:24.588 --> 50:27.250
It just needs a little work, that's all.

50:29.593 --> 50:31.356
Seat belt. Come on.

50:44.474 --> 50:46.465
I don't wanna write this down

50:46.576 --> 50:50.012
I wanna tell you how I feel right now

50:50.113 --> 50:53.014
I don't wanna take no time
to write this down

50:53.116 --> 50:55.016
I wanna tell you how I feel right now

50:55.118 --> 50:56.244
He can't dribble.

50:58.121 --> 50:59.247
Yeah.

50:59.389 --> 51:00.913
Tomorrow may never come

51:01.091 --> 51:04.959
For you or me life is not promised

51:05.128 --> 51:06.789
You all right, man?

51:06.897 --> 51:08.455
Tomorrow may never show up

51:08.565 --> 51:09.827
How'd you know?

51:09.933 --> 51:11.423
I'm a fan.

51:12.969 --> 51:14.937
I haven't been here in years.

51:15.605 --> 51:18.199
This court kept me out of a lot of trouble.

51:18.675 --> 51:23.305
Every day, practicing for hours,
dreaming that one day...

51:24.748 --> 51:25.737
Watch that, watch that.

51:25.849 --> 51:27.646
Every time I come to the Rucker,

51:27.751 --> 51:31.915
I'm just amazed at the raw talent
that some of these kids have.

51:33.623 --> 51:37.024
And how no matter how good they are,

51:37.794 --> 51:40.627
most of them
will never make it to the NBA.

51:43.333 --> 51:44.664
But not you.

51:46.436 --> 51:47.869
See, you're blessed.

51:47.971 --> 51:50.496
You made it. Your dream came true.

51:52.476 --> 51:54.068
Hey, that's Scott McKnight!

51:56.413 --> 51:58.210
Well, I think you've been spotted.

51:59.416 --> 52:00.849
Yo, what's up, man?

52:00.951 --> 52:02.578
All right, what's up, yo?

52:04.988 --> 52:07.855
- Good, good.
- Watch his knee.

52:07.958 --> 52:09.926
That's the one you hurt, right?
That's the one?

52:10.026 --> 52:12.153
I've seen your handle over there,
I see your handle over there.

52:12.262 --> 52:14.389
Just playing hard, man,
trying to get back there, you know?

52:14.498 --> 52:15.692
So, what you doing in the hood?

52:15.799 --> 52:17.027
We need you back in the league.

52:17.134 --> 52:18.999
- Yes, sir.
- I'm coming, man.

52:21.538 --> 52:24.302
You really think you could
get me back by the Playoffs?

52:25.108 --> 52:26.166
Yeah.

52:26.776 --> 52:28.266
We got up to eight weeks.

52:28.378 --> 52:30.505
But you're gonna hate me
by the time I'm through with you.

52:30.614 --> 52:31.603
We're on the game, yo.

52:31.715 --> 52:32.875
- Come on, let's go play.
- Let's get to the game!

52:32.983 --> 52:35.918
All right, y'all better show me
some game. Some real game.

52:36.019 --> 52:38.146
- Show him how it's done.
- I'm gonna dunk on you, Scott.

52:38.255 --> 52:39.347
Okay.

52:39.956 --> 52:42.151
He's talking about he's gonna dunk on me?

52:47.564 --> 52:49.156
Is that a smile?

52:49.366 --> 52:51.800
Wow. So we go to work?

52:53.670 --> 52:56.161
Maniac, maniac

52:59.509 --> 53:02.535
Seven, six, five. Come on, trust your leg.

53:02.646 --> 53:07.310
Trust your leg, push it out.
Three, two... Give me 100%.

53:13.924 --> 53:15.152
You okay?

53:15.692 --> 53:17.922
It's all right.
A little bit of pain is to be expected,

53:18.028 --> 53:20.087
but you know what,
you're working your way back.

53:20.197 --> 53:21.994
You got the Playoffs coming up.

53:22.098 --> 53:24.498
You're doing better today
than you were doing a week ago,

53:24.601 --> 53:26.432
better than you were doing
a week before that,

53:26.536 --> 53:30.028
better than a week before that,
so every day, progress.

53:30.273 --> 53:32.969
The knee's about healed,
now it's time to go to work.

53:33.076 --> 53:35.510
It's gonna respond,
don't worry about it, I'm telling you.

53:35.612 --> 53:37.239
Yeah, I'm good, I'm good.

53:37.347 --> 53:38.336
Let's go.

53:39.649 --> 53:44.609
Oh, when I move there's something
about the way I get down

53:44.721 --> 53:47.952
Come on, come on. Quick stepping.
Quick step, quick step.

53:48.091 --> 53:49.854
- Your feet on fire
- Your feet on fire

53:49.993 --> 53:52.052
- Your feet on fire
- Your feet on fire

53:52.162 --> 53:53.857
- Your feet on fire
- Your feet on fire

53:53.964 --> 53:56.228
- Your feet on fire
- Your feet on fire

53:57.234 --> 53:59.134
Hopped on the boat
when the boat left the dock

53:59.236 --> 54:01.602
Being hot right off
when we seemed to stop

54:01.705 --> 54:03.866
But seeming to stop is what we were not

54:03.974 --> 54:05.942
Seeming to stop is what we were not

54:06.109 --> 54:09.704
Oh, when I move
there's something about the way

54:10.046 --> 54:13.880
I get down
that makes the people say

54:14.150 --> 54:16.675
- Your feet on fire
- Your feet on fire

54:16.786 --> 54:18.686
- Your feet on fire
- Your feet on fire

54:18.788 --> 54:20.983
- Your feet on fire
- Your feet on fire

54:21.091 --> 54:23.582
- Your feet on fire
- Your feet on fire

54:23.927 --> 54:25.258
Oh, your feet on fire

54:25.362 --> 54:27.660
- Your feet on fire
- Your feet on fire

54:28.365 --> 54:31.698
Rock it out. Lock it out. That's what
I'm talking about, Scott McKnight!

54:31.801 --> 54:33.359
- Feel good?
- Yeah, I feel good. Let me get some water.

54:33.470 --> 54:35.165
- Feel tired?
- Yeah, I'm... I'm straight up.

54:35.272 --> 54:36.637
Water, that's for rich people.

54:36.740 --> 54:39.800
Come on, I ain't got no water.
All I got is guts. Let's go!

54:43.113 --> 54:45.479
You realize
how good you are at this?

54:45.915 --> 54:48.383
You know, you ain't got to
sweat me or nothing about it.

54:48.485 --> 54:50.885
Nah, seriously, you're doing great work.

54:50.987 --> 54:54.150
Well, it's not often I get to combine
my love of basketball with my job.

54:54.257 --> 54:57.021
Maybe this shouldn't be a one-time thing.

54:57.127 --> 54:58.651
What're you talking about?

54:58.762 --> 55:02.789
I mean, why not work your program
full-time? Take it to the pro level.

55:02.899 --> 55:05.265
- The NBA?
- Why not?

55:06.169 --> 55:10.435
I guess I could see myself hanging
around a bunch of hot, sweaty guys.

55:13.576 --> 55:15.043
That ain't cool.

55:17.647 --> 55:20.480
Eleanor? That hooptie has a name?

55:21.151 --> 55:24.279
Hey, don't talk about my Mustang.
That was my grandfather's car.

55:24.387 --> 55:25.786
He wanted me to have it when he died.

55:25.889 --> 55:27.914
I'm sure the invention
of the first automobile

55:28.024 --> 55:30.049
was fascinating back in the day.

55:30.727 --> 55:32.285
You got jokes.

55:32.729 --> 55:35.220
Well, keeping Eleanor with her dimple.

55:35.565 --> 55:36.725
Dimple?

55:36.966 --> 55:39.434
The dent in the driver's side door.

55:39.803 --> 55:44.172
My grandfather had a dimple
on his left side, so just like Eleanor.

55:44.607 --> 55:47.440
That's why you never got the door fixed.

55:47.811 --> 55:50.780
Well, I looked into it,
but every body shop said the same thing.

55:50.880 --> 55:54.577
To fix the door, you gotta lose the dimple.
I'd rather keep the dimple,

55:54.684 --> 55:57.517
- sore shoulder and all. Come on, let's go.
- All right.

55:57.620 --> 56:00.589
- Two more sets.
- You're not gonna let up 'cause it's Friday?

56:00.690 --> 56:03.158
- No. Correct.
- Leslie.

56:14.304 --> 56:16.067
They were mad thick.

56:16.406 --> 56:17.964
Like Coke bottle glasses?

56:18.074 --> 56:20.565
- Like headlights.
- Oh, my goodness. No.

56:20.677 --> 56:22.975
They called me "four eyes"
and "Mister Magoo."

56:23.079 --> 56:26.344
Now, see, me, unlike yourself,
I was popular in high school.

56:26.850 --> 56:27.874
- Why you...
- No, 'cause you know what,

56:27.984 --> 56:31.715
I was cool with all of the nerds, cool
with the jocks and thugs, you know.

56:31.821 --> 56:34.153
But the girls did give me
a little bit of drama

56:34.257 --> 56:36.987
'cause the guys always liked
having me around them.

56:37.093 --> 56:39.254
Look at... You was...
You was that girl, huh?

56:39.362 --> 56:41.489
You know I wasn't that girl.

56:41.898 --> 56:43.229
I was a good girl.

56:43.333 --> 56:45.130
I know you're a good girl.
You want to get something to eat?

56:45.235 --> 56:46.793
Yeah, let's do that.

56:46.903 --> 56:49.201
- Yeah, man. What you gonna have?
- What you want?

56:49.305 --> 56:51.535
I think I want a whiting sandwich.

56:51.641 --> 56:53.871
Let me get some cocoa bread, too, bro.

56:53.977 --> 56:55.706
What you know about cocoa bread?

56:55.812 --> 56:57.473
I know about cocoa bread, girl.

56:57.580 --> 57:02.381
I thought you'd be eating sushi
and Mediterranean food, olives and...

57:07.924 --> 57:10.791
I wouldn't know my father
if he walked right past me.

57:11.261 --> 57:13.320
Sometimes, during the game,

57:13.563 --> 57:16.498
I look into the seats, wonder if he's in one.

57:18.034 --> 57:19.001
Cheering for me.

57:23.339 --> 57:25.307
That must be a trip, huh?

57:25.775 --> 57:27.970
It is what it is.

57:28.678 --> 57:30.111
There you go.

57:31.314 --> 57:32.941
- Bless you.
- Thank you.

57:34.217 --> 57:35.206
Take your book.

57:35.318 --> 57:37.650
You know, I'm gonna keep taking books.

57:37.754 --> 57:38.982
Whatever.

57:41.157 --> 57:42.215
What?

57:43.193 --> 57:46.219
So, you know I gotta ask you, right?

57:46.329 --> 57:47.523
Ask me what?

57:48.231 --> 57:52.895
Well, you haven't been out
on one single date since you been here.

57:53.203 --> 57:54.932
I haven't seen your cell being blown up,

57:55.038 --> 57:57.472
or you texting people back and forth.

57:58.308 --> 58:01.243
- So, what's up?
- Okay, all right, I'm single.

58:02.078 --> 58:03.978
But you're great.

58:05.715 --> 58:09.742
You're funny. You're smart.
You're attractive.

58:11.421 --> 58:12.547
Why are you single?

58:13.089 --> 58:15.557
I just haven't found what I'm looking for.

58:15.892 --> 58:16.859
What's that?

58:20.797 --> 58:23.095
The one I can't live without.

58:25.668 --> 58:28.466
- Live with that.
- Cutting that.

58:28.805 --> 58:30.966
- Deal with that.
- You still gonna get set.

58:32.475 --> 58:33.942
You might be getting a cold.

58:34.410 --> 58:35.536
I don't get sick.

58:44.387 --> 58:46.787
- I could have got that.
- I know.

58:47.323 --> 58:49.791
But now I'm gonna take care of you.

58:59.068 --> 59:00.558
That's not bad.

59:00.703 --> 59:01.965
I got skills.

59:04.841 --> 59:07.571
You probably been taking care
of everybody but yourself

59:07.911 --> 59:09.242
your whole life.

59:10.813 --> 59:12.110
Not really.

59:13.850 --> 59:14.839
Right.

59:15.852 --> 59:17.012
Take a little more.

59:17.253 --> 59:19.448
Mmm. I don't really want none.

59:19.656 --> 59:23.956
I need you to get better.
We need you to get better. Okay?

59:27.430 --> 59:28.863
Good. You want some tea?

59:29.198 --> 59:30.426
Mmm-mmm.

59:34.837 --> 59:36.099
I'm here, okay?

59:38.841 --> 59:40.638
If you need anything.

59:42.078 --> 59:44.308
I have to get to Cartagena.

59:44.447 --> 59:49.009
Cartagena? Angel, you are hell and gone
from Cartagena.

59:49.352 --> 59:51.286
- Cartagena 's over there on the coast.
- Bless you.

59:51.621 --> 59:52.918
- Please, I need your help.
- Thank you.

59:53.022 --> 59:55.752
- That's my new career.
- It's very late.

59:56.593 --> 01:00:00.222
Lady, half a year's work just flew
south for the winter, all right?

01:00:00.630 --> 01:00:01.961
My jeep is totaled.

01:00:06.102 --> 01:00:09.162
Now, anyone who loves
to cook needs to pay attention

01:00:09.272 --> 01:00:12.708
because today we are giving away
all our trade secrets...

01:00:16.813 --> 01:00:18.804
A keystone to any chef's kitchen.

01:00:18.915 --> 01:00:20.576
The Mandolin is made
with stainless steel...

01:00:52.446 --> 01:00:53.606
I got ball, I got ball, I got ball.

01:00:53.714 --> 01:00:55.875
Okay, here's a play
that we'll see what he's got.

01:00:56.016 --> 01:00:58.746
I think it's amazing he's back
so soon after that kind of injury.

01:00:59.320 --> 01:01:01.254
Okay, so far, so good.

01:01:01.355 --> 01:01:02.447
Come on, Scott, pick it up, let's go.

01:01:02.556 --> 01:01:04.956
- You know, he's gotta be a little...
- Little stiff maybe, a little stiff.

01:01:05.059 --> 01:01:06.390
Yeah, a little stiff right now.

01:01:06.593 --> 01:01:09.619
With Game 7 tomorrow,
do you think he's ready to play?

01:01:10.264 --> 01:01:12.232
Did you see that?

01:01:12.333 --> 01:01:13.732
Come on, man. Come on, man.

01:01:13.834 --> 01:01:15.699
Come on, Scott!
Show us you're ready.

01:01:16.236 --> 01:01:19.933
Normally he's so instinctive,
he always sees that.

01:01:20.474 --> 01:01:21.736
So what's it gonna be?

01:01:21.875 --> 01:01:22.899
We need him, Rod. We need him.

01:01:23.010 --> 01:01:25.069
Yeah, we got no chance without him,
I'll tell you that.

01:02:06.420 --> 01:02:08.354
I'm sorry, why'd you stop?

01:02:08.989 --> 01:02:10.456
'Cause I suck.

01:02:10.824 --> 01:02:13.816
I just started to play this thing again
a few months ago.

01:02:14.027 --> 01:02:16.427
Wow, this is smooth.

01:02:17.197 --> 01:02:20.291
- How many rooms you got in this house?
- A lot.

01:02:20.534 --> 01:02:22.058
Well, go ahead, try it again.

01:02:23.303 --> 01:02:25.396
I'm much more comfortable on the court.

01:02:25.639 --> 01:02:28.005
Aw, go ahead and play it.

01:02:31.945 --> 01:02:33.139
I know that song.

01:02:38.852 --> 01:02:41.980
The more I see you

01:02:44.024 --> 01:02:47.289
The more I need you

01:02:47.961 --> 01:02:49.326
Ah.

01:02:51.432 --> 01:02:53.992
How's that part go? Oh, yeah.

01:02:54.535 --> 01:02:57.629
It grows, it grows

01:03:02.776 --> 01:03:05.404
- We weren't that bad.
- No, we could be a lounge act.

01:03:05.512 --> 01:03:07.036
Take this thing to Vegas.

01:03:09.383 --> 01:03:11.476
Hey, what are you doing
up this late, anyway?

01:03:11.585 --> 01:03:12.609
It's 3:00 in the morning.

01:03:12.719 --> 01:03:17.383
I should be asking you that.
You the one with the game in 16 hours.

01:03:20.160 --> 01:03:21.718
What if I get on that floor tomorrow

01:03:21.829 --> 01:03:24.821
- and then it's just like...
- You won't. You won't fail.

01:03:25.766 --> 01:03:27.199
What if I do?

01:03:29.436 --> 01:03:31.063
What if my knee goes out on me?

01:03:32.840 --> 01:03:35.001
What if I can't play anymore?

01:03:40.681 --> 01:03:42.808
Who would I be without basketball?

01:03:43.183 --> 01:03:47.313
Scott McKnight. You'll still be you.

01:03:48.288 --> 01:03:51.314
Basketball is what you do.
It's not who you are.

01:03:51.425 --> 01:03:54.417
And no matter what happens tomorrow,
you're still a champion.

01:03:55.062 --> 01:03:57.394
You're still an extraordinary human being.

01:03:58.665 --> 01:04:00.656
And you'll still be Scott.

01:04:05.973 --> 01:04:07.133
What's that?

01:04:07.241 --> 01:04:08.708
- You don't know about that right there?
- What is it?

01:04:08.876 --> 01:04:11.242
That right there is my surefire

01:04:11.345 --> 01:04:15.304
"eyes closed from half-court
'swish' slam dunk"

01:04:15.415 --> 01:04:16.609
cheer-up remedy.

01:04:18.185 --> 01:04:20.653
It's cheering you up already, it's working.

01:04:21.655 --> 01:04:22.747
Try one.

01:04:22.856 --> 01:04:25.347
Marshmallows and chocolate chips?
I don't think so.

01:04:25.459 --> 01:04:28.360
- You might like it.
- No. No, no, I'm good.

01:04:28.662 --> 01:04:30.095
Just try one.

01:04:31.031 --> 01:04:32.521
All right.

01:04:40.107 --> 01:04:41.597
Mmm-hmm.

01:04:43.810 --> 01:04:46.074
- lncredible.
- Told you.

01:04:48.015 --> 01:04:50.643
- And I do feel better.
- See, it works.

01:04:51.251 --> 01:04:53.185
- Let me get another one of those.
- No, you can't.

01:04:53.287 --> 01:04:55.915
No, player. No, player, that's all you get.

01:04:56.123 --> 01:04:57.988
- Don't be stingy now.
- No, no, the rest of these is mine.

01:04:58.091 --> 01:04:59.388
Stop playing.

01:05:09.803 --> 01:05:11.532
You better get some rest.

01:05:20.681 --> 01:05:21.648
Yeah.

01:05:42.336 --> 01:05:45.169
It is Game 7
of the Eastern Conference finals.

01:05:45.272 --> 01:05:46.398
Hi, everybody. I'm Marv Albert,

01:05:46.506 --> 01:05:49.737
along with "The Czar" Mike Fratello,
Kenny "The Jet" Smith.

01:05:49.943 --> 01:05:52.776
One of these teams,
the Nets or the Miami Heat,

01:05:52.946 --> 01:05:56.143
will leave the lzod Center
as kings of the East

01:05:56.249 --> 01:05:58.911
and will go up against
the Western Conference champion.

01:05:59.019 --> 01:06:00.145
- Heat!
- The big story,

01:06:00.253 --> 01:06:03.154
Scott McKnight will be back in the lineup

01:06:03.323 --> 01:06:06.224
- and what perfect timing for the Nets.
- Nets!

01:06:06.326 --> 01:06:09.727
Now, if they have any chance to
make it to the NBA Finals since 2003,

01:06:09.830 --> 01:06:12.731
it all rests on the shoulders
of their franchise player, McKnight.

01:06:12.933 --> 01:06:16.164
- I called you, like, five times, man.
- I know. I got your messages, man.

01:06:16.269 --> 01:06:17.429
Thanks for hollering at me.

01:06:17.537 --> 01:06:19.869
Come on, man, you'd do the same to me
if I was going through the storm.

01:06:19.973 --> 01:06:21.099
- Yes, sir.
- You good?

01:06:21.241 --> 01:06:23.072
- Yeah, I'm good, I'm good, man.
- All right.

01:06:23.176 --> 01:06:24.837
You know, if I wasn't good,
I wouldn't be here.

01:06:24.978 --> 01:06:26.570
You better be good 'cause my game
wouldn't be the same

01:06:26.713 --> 01:06:27.737
if I couldn't take you to the hole.

01:06:28.081 --> 01:06:29.776
There you go! Let's go, let's go!

01:06:36.957 --> 01:06:41.189
(CHANTlNG) Defense!
Defense! Defense! Defense!

01:07:36.216 --> 01:07:37.547
Timeout!

01:08:01.742 --> 01:08:03.710
- You okay?
- I'm good, I'm good.

01:08:03.977 --> 01:08:04.944
- Be right back.
- Okay.

01:08:14.921 --> 01:08:19.358
You are playing like you're afraid
this knee is gonna fail you. Well, it won't.

01:08:19.926 --> 01:08:21.826
- Leslie, I'm all in...
- Listen to me!

01:08:21.962 --> 01:08:27.627
Anything you need to do,
anything you want to do, you can do.

01:08:28.033 --> 01:08:30.161
Believe in yourself.

01:08:30.504 --> 01:08:32.734
You will not fail.

01:08:33.073 --> 01:08:35.064
Come on, let's go to work.

01:08:50.524 --> 01:08:52.116
- One, two, break!
- Together!

01:08:52.225 --> 01:08:53.385
- Let's go. Come on.
- Let's go. Let's go.

01:08:55.629 --> 01:08:57.426
- Let's go!
- ls he all right?

01:09:08.475 --> 01:09:09.999
Come on, baby, come on!

01:09:11.077 --> 01:09:12.510
Come on. Hit me.

01:09:16.582 --> 01:09:17.709
Come on, man.

01:09:29.563 --> 01:09:32.691
Yes! Yes! That's what I'm talking about!

01:09:32.866 --> 01:09:34.356
That's what I'm talking about, baby!

01:09:48.582 --> 01:09:50.447
Twelve seconds left here
in the fourth quarter.

01:09:50.550 --> 01:09:54.577
The Nets are down by two, 106-104.

01:09:54.688 --> 01:09:56.019
It has come down to this.

01:09:56.122 --> 01:09:58.352
The Nets got to.
They gotta get back to that pick and roll.

01:09:58.458 --> 01:10:01.120
Neither team with a timeout left
or a foul to give.

01:10:01.228 --> 01:10:03.458
With the Heat up two,
they can't give up a three.

01:10:03.630 --> 01:10:07.293
For the Nets, they've got the ball
in the right man's hands, Scott McKnight.

01:10:10.270 --> 01:10:14.969
Here is McKnight for three. Yes!

01:10:15.609 --> 01:10:19.409
Yeah! Yeah! Yes!

01:10:21.548 --> 01:10:23.482
A game winner for McKnight!

01:10:23.583 --> 01:10:28.543
And the Nets, they're headed back
to the NBA Finals!

01:10:28.722 --> 01:10:32.488
Twenty-two points, McKnight,
coming up with the game of his life.

01:10:32.592 --> 01:10:34.492
You think about it, that knee injury

01:10:34.594 --> 01:10:36.494
and how much fortitude
he had to play with,

01:10:36.596 --> 01:10:38.996
just to be on this court,
great effort by McKnight.

01:10:39.099 --> 01:10:41.966
I don't think that one person
watching this game tonight

01:10:42.068 --> 01:10:44.593
would have thought Scott McKnight
would be back on the court,

01:10:44.704 --> 01:10:46.763
Iet alone hit the winning shot.

01:10:47.173 --> 01:10:48.731
Scott! Scott! This way, Scott!

01:10:48.842 --> 01:10:51.970
Scott, over here! Scott, over here! Scott!

01:10:53.446 --> 01:10:54.413
Scott, over here! Scott!

01:10:54.681 --> 01:10:56.478
Scott, phenomenal game, man.

01:10:56.583 --> 01:10:57.572
- Phenomenal.
- Thanks, man.

01:10:57.684 --> 01:10:58.708
You know it was a team effort, Stu.

01:10:58.818 --> 01:11:00.445
Yeah, but you were in a zone all your own.

01:11:00.553 --> 01:11:01.520
Well, you should have him
on the show, then.

01:11:01.621 --> 01:11:03.145
Yes, yes. You gotta come do my show.

01:11:03.256 --> 01:11:04.553
- Love to, man.
- Okay?

01:11:05.292 --> 01:11:09.023
- Son, oh, I'm so proud of you.
- Thank you, Ma. Thank you, Ma.

01:11:10.363 --> 01:11:12.194
You were great.

01:11:20.340 --> 01:11:21.637
Thank you.

01:11:22.709 --> 01:11:24.768
- You're welcome.
- No, really.

01:11:26.846 --> 01:11:27.972
Thank you.

01:11:32.452 --> 01:11:35.512
- She deserves a bonus, right?
- Yes.

01:11:36.823 --> 01:11:39.257
How about dinner someplace really nice?

01:11:40.393 --> 01:11:42.486
You better be packing something
in that wallet.

01:11:42.929 --> 01:11:44.863
I'm not one of those salad-eating chicks.

01:11:47.033 --> 01:11:48.000
I like her.

01:11:48.468 --> 01:11:50.368
All right, and these people like you.
Let's go.

01:11:50.470 --> 01:11:51.630
All right, all right.

01:11:56.042 --> 01:11:58.840
If we leave here in the next 10 minutes
and take some side streets,

01:11:58.945 --> 01:12:01.106
we could probably beat the traffic.

01:12:15.862 --> 01:12:16.829
Wow.

01:12:22.002 --> 01:12:26.803
- You are so beautiful.
- Thank you. So are you.

01:12:28.008 --> 01:12:30.408
- Shall we?
- Yes.

01:12:55.135 --> 01:12:57.626
I can't believe you got
Terence Blanchard. Wow.

01:12:57.737 --> 01:12:59.227
I told you, I know people.

01:13:41.881 --> 01:13:44.782
- I had such a good time tonight.
- Me, too. Me, too.

01:13:48.788 --> 01:13:51.416
What is this? What...

01:13:52.292 --> 01:13:53.259
You'll see.

01:13:56.863 --> 01:13:58.626
- No, you didn't!
- Yeah, I did.

01:13:58.731 --> 01:14:00.028
- No, you didn't!
- Yeah, I did.

01:14:00.900 --> 01:14:06.770
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
Oh, my God, look at my car!

01:14:06.873 --> 01:14:08.636
- That's not it, though.
- What?

01:14:08.741 --> 01:14:09.833
Check out the inside.

01:14:12.412 --> 01:14:13.504
Look.

01:14:14.514 --> 01:14:15.742
Oh.

01:14:17.951 --> 01:14:22.445
- What? Butterfly doors?
- It's the only way I could keep the dimple.

01:14:25.125 --> 01:14:27.923
Eleanor. Look at you, girl.

01:14:34.167 --> 01:14:35.794
Everything's new.

01:14:36.402 --> 01:14:38.029
Yeah. You got a sunroof.

01:14:38.138 --> 01:14:39.730
I got a sunroof.

01:14:39.839 --> 01:14:42.330
When you ride out,
you can let the sun just shine on you.

01:14:42.775 --> 01:14:43.799
I love it.

01:14:44.410 --> 01:14:46.037
Wow, man, it's brand new.

01:14:46.279 --> 01:14:48.144
Yes, this is brand new for you.

01:14:48.681 --> 01:14:50.672
I don't know what to say.

01:14:51.417 --> 01:14:53.544
Just say you'll let me be
your first passenger.

01:14:54.220 --> 01:14:55.244
Of course.

01:15:03.296 --> 01:15:05.594
I just can't believe this.

01:15:07.333 --> 01:15:08.925
I'm so happy.

01:15:12.739 --> 01:15:15.435
What can we scrape together

01:15:15.542 --> 01:15:19.342
From our love-worn emotions?

01:15:19.445 --> 01:15:21.845
Handfuls ofhate

01:15:22.348 --> 01:15:25.476
And the bittersweet devotion

01:15:26.419 --> 01:15:31.550
Who will find me under this mean sleep?

01:15:34.060 --> 01:15:39.623
How could the clouds tease us
into thinking it might rain?

01:15:39.732 --> 01:15:46.501
I had a mean sleep over you

01:15:46.606 --> 01:15:52.306
And it hurts coming back to life

01:16:15.468 --> 01:16:16.435
"Enjoy."

01:16:19.939 --> 01:16:21.372
Enjoy, huh?

01:16:23.042 --> 01:16:26.478
Something different in the air today

01:16:26.613 --> 01:16:30.845
It's like a new world's
blooming under my feet

01:16:30.950 --> 01:16:32.941
I'm walking on air
Never a care

01:16:33.052 --> 01:16:34.917
Wherever I want
I'm already there

01:16:35.021 --> 01:16:39.117
I'm mystical, magical,
highly unnatural, super delicious...

01:16:39.225 --> 01:16:40.715
- And sweet
- Sweet

01:16:40.827 --> 01:16:42.852
Cloud is clear

01:16:42.996 --> 01:16:46.523
I got a birdsong right in my ear

01:16:46.633 --> 01:16:50.535
Butterflies kiss my eyes...

01:16:56.843 --> 01:16:59.209
- Hi.
- Hey.

01:17:00.980 --> 01:17:04.416
- What are you doing here?
- I want to talk to Scott.

01:17:04.917 --> 01:17:06.782
Come on. Let me in.

01:17:08.288 --> 01:17:09.778
Scott's not here.

01:17:09.889 --> 01:17:11.720
Oh, I'll wait for him.

01:17:13.826 --> 01:17:15.259
I missed you.

01:17:19.132 --> 01:17:20.963
You have a glow today.

01:17:23.202 --> 01:17:24.430
Has everything been good?

01:17:33.713 --> 01:17:35.010
Hey, baby.

01:17:40.053 --> 01:17:42.021
I know you're probably wondering
what I'm doing here.

01:17:42.121 --> 01:17:43.145
Yeah, you shouldn't just

01:17:43.256 --> 01:17:45.087
- come by without...
- But, please, Scott,

01:17:45.191 --> 01:17:47.682
what I have to say is long overdue.

01:17:48.561 --> 01:17:51.029
I am so sorry I left you that note.

01:17:51.631 --> 01:17:56.068
But I didn't know what to do,
I was so confused.

01:17:57.670 --> 01:17:59.831
My mom died when I was three.

01:18:02.241 --> 01:18:05.142
My dad left the day after my fifth birthday,

01:18:06.379 --> 01:18:09.212
and somehow I knew
I'd never see him again.

01:18:11.217 --> 01:18:12.775
And I never did.

01:18:13.820 --> 01:18:15.378
And I was terrified,

01:18:16.155 --> 01:18:18.749
terrified of loving someone completely,

01:18:18.858 --> 01:18:21.554
only to watch them walk out
of my life one day.

01:18:22.395 --> 01:18:23.362
So,

01:18:24.263 --> 01:18:25.491
I'd run.

01:18:26.532 --> 01:18:28.557
I wouldn't have left you, Morgan.

01:18:29.268 --> 01:18:31.259
I know what it feels like to be abandoned.

01:18:31.371 --> 01:18:33.635
But I know me.

01:18:34.107 --> 01:18:37.873
And I would have left you way
before that ever happened.

01:18:38.878 --> 01:18:40.846
That's why I went to get help.

01:18:40.947 --> 01:18:44.644
Scott, if there's an ounce of something

01:18:46.085 --> 01:18:47.848
you still feel for me,

01:18:50.423 --> 01:18:52.357
please give us a chance.

01:18:55.762 --> 01:18:57.093
I love you.

01:18:58.398 --> 01:18:59.524
Baby.

01:19:01.100 --> 01:19:03.125
We're meant to be together.

01:19:05.171 --> 01:19:07.002
I think you should go.

01:19:10.209 --> 01:19:11.938
I need time to think.

01:19:14.580 --> 01:19:15.638
Okay.

01:19:18.151 --> 01:19:20.745
Tell Leslie I said goodbye, okay?

01:19:43.009 --> 01:19:45.534
- Where you going?
- Home.

01:19:46.012 --> 01:19:48.003
Leslie, why are you leaving?

01:19:48.114 --> 01:19:50.139
You tell me why I'm leaving.

01:19:52.518 --> 01:19:55.351
Three months ago,
this was the woman that I planned

01:19:55.455 --> 01:19:57.582
to spend the rest of my life with.

01:19:57.990 --> 01:20:00.322
She's gone through a lot to be with me.

01:20:02.161 --> 01:20:05.221
Leslie, the last thing
I ever wanted to do was hurt you.

01:20:05.832 --> 01:20:07.663
You are so special to me.

01:20:07.967 --> 01:20:09.958
I know I'm special to you, Scott.

01:20:10.670 --> 01:20:12.570
A very special friend.

01:20:13.906 --> 01:20:16.704
- You are.
- Well, that's not enough for me!

01:21:20.506 --> 01:21:21.666
Leslie.

01:21:22.542 --> 01:21:23.736
You here?

01:21:31.017 --> 01:21:32.985
You want to talk about it, baby girl?

01:21:33.085 --> 01:21:34.313
I'm fine.

01:21:58.644 --> 01:22:01.875
I like to see patients get better,
but I hate to see them go.

01:22:02.848 --> 01:22:06.443
But I know it must feel kind of weird
being back here

01:22:06.552 --> 01:22:11.080
after the last few months you've had.
Like, living in a mansion!

01:22:11.190 --> 01:22:14.591
Come on, man, a mansion
with Scott McKnight, of all people.

01:22:14.694 --> 01:22:15.956
OMG!

01:22:16.829 --> 01:22:19.992
It all had to be, like, kind of surreal, right?

01:22:21.567 --> 01:22:23.933
I mean, it was kind of surreal.

01:22:24.437 --> 01:22:27.338
You know, Scott McKnight
is a really good...

01:22:28.608 --> 01:22:30.439
He's a great employer.

01:22:33.179 --> 01:22:36.444
But working with him did help me
realize what I want to do next.

01:22:36.549 --> 01:22:37.846
Did she just say next?

01:22:37.950 --> 01:22:39.781
Yeah. Where are you going?

01:22:40.219 --> 01:22:42.710
I want to be an athletic trainer in the NBA.

01:22:43.356 --> 01:22:45.381
I didn't know they had
women trainers in the NBA.

01:22:45.491 --> 01:22:47.550
Well, not that many, but they do.

01:22:47.994 --> 01:22:50.019
I think I should at least give it a try.

01:22:50.463 --> 01:22:52.988
All I hear is courtside tickets

01:22:53.899 --> 01:22:54.923
Coming my way

01:22:55.034 --> 01:22:56.763
Will you stop thinking about yourself?

01:22:56.869 --> 01:22:58.234
Well, I'm just saying.

01:22:58.337 --> 01:23:00.771
But since she brought it up,
you're gonna get some tickets, right?

01:23:00.873 --> 01:23:03.899
You know what? Y'all should be together.
Y'all deserve each other.

01:23:04.010 --> 01:23:05.409
I mean, I'll sit with him at the...

01:23:06.112 --> 01:23:08.307
- I mean...
- You're gonna hook us up. Damn.

01:23:20.292 --> 01:23:22.123
Mr. McKnight, Miss Alexander.

01:23:22.228 --> 01:23:24.526
Chef Morimoto asked me
to take extra special care of you.

01:23:24.630 --> 01:23:26.120
Can I start you off
with something to drink?

01:23:26.232 --> 01:23:28.496
- Morgan?
- Champagne.

01:23:28.601 --> 01:23:30.569
Dom Perignon? Cristal?

01:23:30.670 --> 01:23:32.331
Oh, no, no, no. What are your sakes?

01:23:32.438 --> 01:23:34.133
May I suggest our Honjozo?

01:23:34.240 --> 01:23:36.970
That might be nice. And your Junmai?

01:23:37.076 --> 01:23:39.067
We have a great Daiginjo.

01:23:39.178 --> 01:23:40.543
Is that the one with the melon?

01:23:40.646 --> 01:23:44.173
Melon, honeysuckle fragrance,
and a rich texture. Superb.

01:23:44.517 --> 01:23:45.814
Mmm.

01:23:46.252 --> 01:23:48.186
Then the Daiginjo it is.

01:23:52.558 --> 01:23:58.053
So, I know this may be premature,
considering we just got back together,

01:23:58.164 --> 01:24:00.928
but I just couldn't help myself.

01:24:01.367 --> 01:24:03.232
What are you talking about?

01:24:03.602 --> 01:24:05.934
Okay, well, after I shopped
at Bergdorf's today,

01:24:06.038 --> 01:24:10.407
I swung by the Plaza and learned that
if we wanted to have our wedding there,

01:24:10.509 --> 01:24:14.172
there's a Saturday in September
just opened. The 15th.

01:24:14.447 --> 01:24:18.315
Would it be too optimistic to reserve it?
Just in case?

01:24:18.417 --> 01:24:21.443
'Cause the next opening's
not for, like, a year and a half.

01:24:24.156 --> 01:24:25.646
You were right.

01:24:27.059 --> 01:24:28.526
Way premature.

01:24:32.698 --> 01:24:35.292
Look, you just came back into my life.

01:24:37.036 --> 01:24:39.630
What I mean is, I'm happy you're here,

01:24:40.039 --> 01:24:42.906
- so we could try to work things out...
- Are you in this, Scott?

01:24:43.008 --> 01:24:44.873
'Cause if you're not really gonna
give us a second chance,

01:24:44.977 --> 01:24:47.741
- I deserve the right to know. I...
- Morgan. Morgan.

01:24:49.782 --> 01:24:51.716
After all that's happened,

01:24:53.252 --> 01:24:55.220
I need to take this slow.

01:24:56.021 --> 01:24:58.353
And I need you to be okay with that.

01:25:01.594 --> 01:25:02.925
Here you go.

01:25:53.179 --> 01:25:54.476
Hey, babe.

01:25:55.514 --> 01:25:57.641
Would you mind if I closed the door?

01:25:58.450 --> 01:25:59.474
No.

01:25:59.652 --> 01:26:01.643
Aw! Thanks, sweetie.

01:26:17.837 --> 01:26:20.601
You have three unheard messages.

01:26:21.507 --> 01:26:22.997
Hello, I'm calling for Leslie Wright.

01:26:23.108 --> 01:26:26.771
Leslie, this is Aaron Nelson,
head athletic trainer for the Phoenix Suns.

01:26:26.912 --> 01:26:29.881
Scott McKnight tells me
you 're the reason for his quick recovery.

01:26:29.982 --> 01:26:32.280
I could use a pro like you on staff.
Can you call me?

01:26:32.384 --> 01:26:36.514
My number is 602-555-0867.

01:26:36.922 --> 01:26:38.480
Look forward to speaking with you.

01:26:38.591 --> 01:26:41.253
Hey, Leslie.
Elton Brand with the Philadelphia 76ers.

01:26:41.360 --> 01:26:42.384
What?

01:26:42.494 --> 01:26:44.462
Our GM would typically make
this kind of call,

01:26:44.563 --> 01:26:46.394
but I insisted that he let me do it.

01:26:46.498 --> 01:26:48.989
We need you, Leslie.
We want you to be our new trainer.

01:26:49.101 --> 01:26:50.796
You have got to be kidding me.

01:26:50.903 --> 01:26:53.235
Let's talk about it. Hit me up on my cell.

01:26:55.374 --> 01:26:58.002
Leslie, this is Tim Walsh
with the New Jersey Nets.

01:26:58.110 --> 01:27:00.578
- Nets!
- Listen. Great job with Scott.

01:27:00.679 --> 01:27:02.203
Incredible job, in fact.

01:27:02.414 --> 01:27:04.109
We want you to be
an assistant athletic trainer

01:27:04.216 --> 01:27:05.774
- with the Nets organization.
- No.

01:27:05.885 --> 01:27:08.615
Would love to talk with you about it.
Give me a call, at my office.

01:27:08.721 --> 01:27:12.157
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

01:27:22.468 --> 01:27:23.628
My God.

01:27:30.142 --> 01:27:31.302
There he is.

01:27:31.410 --> 01:27:33.207
- It better be good.
- Oh, it's better than good.

01:27:33.312 --> 01:27:35.678
I just got off the phone
with Nets management.

01:27:35.781 --> 01:27:39.808
Your new and improved contract
looks like it's gonna close.

01:27:39.919 --> 01:27:41.147
That's great.

01:27:41.253 --> 01:27:43.551
What's great are the terms
of the five-year deal.

01:27:43.656 --> 01:27:45.487
Yeah, it's a good day.

01:27:47.226 --> 01:27:49.854
Yeah. Got a new client.

01:27:49.962 --> 01:27:51.486
- Leslie.
- Leslie?

01:27:51.597 --> 01:27:53.929
Yeah, after the work she did with you,
she's become a hot commodity.

01:27:54.033 --> 01:27:56.501
Five teams offered her a training position,
including the Nets.

01:27:56.602 --> 01:27:59.867
- She's working with the Nets?
- No, she turned them down.

01:27:59.972 --> 01:28:03.271
But she's seriously weighing an offer
from the 76ers.

01:28:05.744 --> 01:28:08.645
I'm gonna go try
one of those protein shakes.

01:28:13.085 --> 01:28:15.610
All I told them
is I would come see their facility,

01:28:15.721 --> 01:28:17.416
and then I will make my decision.

01:28:17.523 --> 01:28:21.653
So the prospect of you moving
to another town, not knowing a soul,

01:28:21.760 --> 01:28:25.560
is better than staying here
and working for your beloved Nets?

01:28:27.833 --> 01:28:31.200
- Ma, the thing is...
- You're running from something.

01:28:31.303 --> 01:28:33.498
I'm not running from anything.

01:28:33.605 --> 01:28:36.506
I just... I just want to explore my options.

01:28:42.081 --> 01:28:44.948
You fell in love with that man, didn't you?

01:28:45.551 --> 01:28:49.146
Janice, leave the girl alone
and let her get out the door.

01:28:49.254 --> 01:28:51.449
Baby, that kind of man...

01:28:51.557 --> 01:28:53.115
Any man too blind or too stupid

01:28:53.225 --> 01:28:55.625
- not to realize how special you are...
- Daddy. Daddy. Daddy.

01:28:55.728 --> 01:28:57.855
- I'm just saying...
- Daddy. Daddy.

01:28:57.963 --> 01:28:59.828
It's fine. Don't worry.

01:29:00.733 --> 01:29:04.533
The girl who's "supposed"
to get a guy like that, she got him.

01:29:12.144 --> 01:29:14.078
- I love you.
- I love you.

01:29:14.947 --> 01:29:16.073
Call y'all when I'm there.

01:29:22.788 --> 01:29:25.689
Our guest today,
"Great Scott," Scott McKnight,

01:29:25.791 --> 01:29:27.554
star of the New Jersey Nets.

01:29:27.659 --> 01:29:29.786
Much respect, my brother,
we appreciate you taking the time

01:29:29.928 --> 01:29:30.952
to join us today, man.

01:29:31.063 --> 01:29:32.530
Yeah, thanks for having me,
it's good to be here.

01:29:32.631 --> 01:29:34.462
Scott, man, some year.

01:29:35.934 --> 01:29:36.992
Some year, man.

01:29:37.102 --> 01:29:39.400
A career-threatening injury
in the middle of the season,

01:29:39.505 --> 01:29:41.973
everybody counted you out,
including your own team.

01:29:42.074 --> 01:29:43.905
Not even your own doctor thought
you'd make it back

01:29:44.009 --> 01:29:46.705
before the end of the season, but you did.

01:29:46.812 --> 01:29:49.645
And now the Nets
are the Eastern Conference champions.

01:29:50.549 --> 01:29:52.813
How in the world did you do it?

01:29:53.986 --> 01:29:55.283
Two words,

01:29:55.988 --> 01:29:57.455
Leslie Wright.

01:29:59.224 --> 01:30:01.818
The physical therapist
that helped you out, right?

01:30:01.927 --> 01:30:04.225
He just said Leslie's name.
Hold on, hold on.

01:30:04.396 --> 01:30:06.660
She did more than that, Stuart.

01:30:07.599 --> 01:30:08.930
A lot more.

01:30:10.235 --> 01:30:14.069
You know, she saw something in me
that I didn't even see in myself.

01:30:15.974 --> 01:30:17.134
She believed in me so much,

01:30:17.242 --> 01:30:20.040
she practically willed me back
to the game.

01:30:22.114 --> 01:30:24.139
Yeah, it was a lot of hard work,

01:30:24.249 --> 01:30:27.480
but even when I was in pain
and wanted to quit,

01:30:28.020 --> 01:30:29.749
she wouldn't let me.

01:30:30.022 --> 01:30:33.389
Instead, Leslie, she made me laugh.

01:30:35.928 --> 01:30:39.420
Somehow she made
the worst three months of my life

01:30:39.531 --> 01:30:41.158
the best three months of my life.

01:30:44.503 --> 01:30:46.437
I wouldn't be here without her.

01:30:49.842 --> 01:30:51.776
She sounds special, man.

01:30:52.311 --> 01:30:55.405
Yeah. She is.

01:30:56.048 --> 01:30:59.040
I'm sorry, man,
there's someplace I need to be.

01:31:00.586 --> 01:31:02.884
Wait... Scott...

01:31:04.256 --> 01:31:05.245
Wait.

01:31:05.591 --> 01:31:09.083
- Wait, Scott, wait.
- I'm sorry, babe. This is not gonna work.

01:31:09.194 --> 01:31:12.652
No. Scott, I know.

01:31:13.999 --> 01:31:15.432
I understand.

01:31:16.835 --> 01:31:18.666
She's in Philadelphia.

01:31:21.106 --> 01:31:22.403
Thank you.

01:31:42.928 --> 01:31:44.520
And if that's not enough,

01:31:44.630 --> 01:31:47.622
the best practice facility,
great coaching staff,

01:31:48.066 --> 01:31:49.966
me and Andre lguodala.

01:31:50.869 --> 01:31:52.700
So, what do you think?

01:31:54.273 --> 01:31:56.639
- Let me have a day or two.
- That's fair.

01:31:56.742 --> 01:31:58.539
- Thank you.
- All right. Hope to see you.

01:31:58.644 --> 01:31:59.941
All right.

01:32:24.803 --> 01:32:25.861
Hey.

01:32:27.139 --> 01:32:29.505
- Leslie, I want to talk to you.
- What are you doing here?

01:32:29.608 --> 01:32:30.666
Look, I know you didn't want to see me,

01:32:30.776 --> 01:32:32.641
- but I need...
- You're right, I don't. Why are you here?

01:32:32.744 --> 01:32:35.008
For the same reason
I'm willing to leave the Nets.

01:32:35.113 --> 01:32:37.206
I'm in love with you. I know that now.

01:32:37.316 --> 01:32:38.544
No, what you know now

01:32:38.650 --> 01:32:40.845
is that the woman
that you were gonna marry

01:32:40.953 --> 01:32:42.716
is not the woman you thought she was.

01:32:42.821 --> 01:32:45.654
So now here you are, looking for Plan B.

01:32:45.757 --> 01:32:47.384
Huh? You want your best friend,
your cheerleader,

01:32:47.492 --> 01:32:48.959
that was there for you
when the chips were down?

01:32:49.061 --> 01:32:51.655
Well, guess what, Scott,
I don't want to be Plan B.

01:32:51.763 --> 01:32:53.560
And I won't be that,
even for Scott McKnight.

01:32:53.665 --> 01:32:58.034
Listen to me, Leslie, listen.
You're not my fallback plan.

01:32:58.570 --> 01:33:01.539
I'm not here 'cause things
didn't work out with Morgan.

01:33:01.640 --> 01:33:04.404
Be stubborn all you want, but I know you.

01:33:04.977 --> 01:33:07.639
- You don't know me.
- I know you love me.

01:33:08.280 --> 01:33:10.248
I know those feelings
didn't conveniently fade away

01:33:10.349 --> 01:33:11.976
'cause you're mad at me.

01:33:12.084 --> 01:33:14.348
And you have every right to be.

01:33:15.554 --> 01:33:18.546
But I'm not leaving these grounds
without you.

01:33:20.225 --> 01:33:21.590
I'm not waking up another morning

01:33:21.693 --> 01:33:24.594
without being able to look at you
next to me.

01:33:25.964 --> 01:33:29.525
Leslie, you're just right for me.

01:33:32.037 --> 01:33:34.062
And if I have to move to Philadelphia
or to Cleveland

01:33:34.172 --> 01:33:35.764
or wherever I got to go, I am.

01:33:36.942 --> 01:33:39.502
You're kidding me, right?
You're kidding me.

01:33:40.412 --> 01:33:42.846
You're gonna make a call
while I'm pouring out my heart to you?

01:33:47.386 --> 01:33:49.547
Tim? Leslie Wright.

01:33:50.622 --> 01:33:52.988
Is that offer still on the table?

01:33:55.794 --> 01:33:56.920
Great.

01:33:57.896 --> 01:34:00.296
Well, you have a new Nets trainer.

01:34:24.022 --> 01:34:25.353
I love you.

01:34:26.858 --> 01:34:28.416
I love you, too.

01:34:50.849 --> 01:34:55.081
- Scott McKnight sucks!
- Sit down, sit down!

01:34:55.487 --> 01:34:57.512
My husband will flush your whole squad.

01:34:57.622 --> 01:34:59.021
- Yeah, right.
- Sit down!

01:34:59.124 --> 01:35:02.924
Wow, girl, I didn't know you could
still talk trash and work for the team.

01:35:03.028 --> 01:35:06.589
I'm not talking trash.
Scott will flush their whole squad.

01:35:08.200 --> 01:35:10.430
Speaking of which,
I better get back to work.

01:35:10.535 --> 01:35:12.469
- Well, thanks for inviting me.
- Any time.

01:35:12.571 --> 01:35:15.131
- All right, go do you, girl.
- Bye.

01:35:17.709 --> 01:35:19.404
Let's go, let's go!

01:35:26.551 --> 01:35:27.575
Yeah!

01:35:40.766 --> 01:35:43.291
Right here. Camera, right here.

01:35:43.835 --> 01:35:46.861
Why're you the only Net smiling
when you lost by six points?

01:35:46.972 --> 01:35:51.170
- 'Cause I'm the only Net that has you.
- Oh, baby, you so sweet.

01:36:01.286 --> 01:36:03.049
I don 't even care no more

01:36:03.155 --> 01:36:06.181
That's my word, that's for sure

01:36:06.291 --> 01:36:07.986
I don 't even cry no more

01:36:08.093 --> 01:36:11.290
That's absurd, I'm so cured

01:36:11.396 --> 01:36:15.162
I'm so secure with who I is
Oops, who I am

01:36:15.267 --> 01:36:18.759
And I'm a champion for sure, boy
I'm a champ

01:36:18.870 --> 01:36:20.861
Oh, yes, I am

01:36:21.106 --> 01:36:23.233
But what I thought about

01:36:23.341 --> 01:36:25.707
When those people put me down

01:36:26.244 --> 01:36:27.768
They can laugh for now

01:36:27.879 --> 01:36:31.144
But watch it
when I turn this thing around

01:36:31.249 --> 01:36:35.618
I know, I believe
Ain 't nobody gonna do it but me

01:36:35.720 --> 01:36:37.654
I'm fly, no lie

01:36:38.156 --> 01:36:40.283
I'm the truth
Baby, ask me why

01:36:40.392 --> 01:36:42.553
- I'm a champion
- I'm a champion

01:36:42.661 --> 01:36:44.720
- I'm a champion
- I'm a champion

01:36:44.830 --> 01:36:47.856
- I'm a champion
- I'm a champion

01:36:59.878 --> 01:37:01.778
I'm gonna blow your mind

01:37:01.880 --> 01:37:04.246
- I'll hold you close
- Oh, so close

01:37:04.349 --> 01:37:08.308
- Squeeze you tight
- Squeeze you tight

01:37:08.687 --> 01:37:12.521
The next time that I see you

01:37:12.624 --> 01:37:14.387
I'm gonna tell you I love you

01:37:14.493 --> 01:37:17.189
- Cross my heart
- Cross your heart

01:37:17.295 --> 01:37:20.059
And I hope to die

01:37:21.766 --> 01:37:23.358
The next time that I see you

01:37:23.468 --> 01:37:25.698
I grew up talking Chi-Town slang

01:37:25.804 --> 01:37:28.204
Never played soccer
but loved the kick game

01:37:28.306 --> 01:37:30.831
Love chicks with thick frames
and big-lipped dames

01:37:30.942 --> 01:37:33.342
Might see 'em on my arm
'cause I charm like thick chains

01:37:33.445 --> 01:37:36.414
Same section,
all girls they be dressing for checks

01:37:36.515 --> 01:37:38.346
That's when she stepped in front of me

01:37:38.450 --> 01:37:40.884
Light skin, long hair
Like the school days

01:37:40.986 --> 01:37:43.750
Wanna be a big ol'... Whoo!
Let's just say she was blessed

01:37:43.855 --> 01:37:46.255
She had got it from her mamma
God ga ve her the rest

01:37:46.458 --> 01:37:48.358
I'm gonna blow your mind

01:37:48.460 --> 01:37:50.985
- I'll hold you close
- Oh, so close

01:37:51.096 --> 01:37:54.532

I'm gonna tell you I love you

01:38:01.907 --> 01:38:03.704

01:38:03.808 --> 01:38:06.743

We conversating
Talk about life and stuff

01:38:12.350 --> 01:38:14.750
Told her that tonight
was just right for us

01:38:14.853 --> 01:38:17.481
Boldly, she told me,
"Oh, you 've got moves "

01:38:17.589 --> 01:38:20.080
Her friends said,
"Really, no, he 's a good dude "

01:38:20.191 --> 01:38:22.523
Could it be
things go the way that they should?

01:38:22.627 --> 01:38:25.152
From the unexpected
love can be understood

01:38:25.430 --> 01:38:27.557
And in the real game,
only love can win

01:38:27.699 --> 01:38:30.566
I've got the win,
'cause I fell in love with a friend

01:38:30.669 --> 01:38:32.534

01:38:32.637 --> 01:38:35.197
