00:03.041 --> 00:04.166
Hey, Grace.

00:04.542 --> 00:06.041
Meatloaf and peas...

00:06.375 --> 00:07.291
Nice.

00:09.041 --> 00:10.041
You know what I do?

00:10.417 --> 00:11.834
Sometimes I take my corn nibblets and...

00:11.917 --> 00:12.917
Will you go out with me?

00:13.250 --> 00:14.125
No.

00:14.208 --> 00:15.083
Well,

00:15.166 --> 00:17.458
now, you don't get to find out
what I do with my corn nibblets.

00:18.542 --> 00:21.125
Dude, you gotta let it go with Grace, man.

00:21.208 --> 00:22.458
You're just not her type.

00:22.667 --> 00:23.667
What's her type?

00:23.750 --> 00:25.709
You know, guys that do things big.

00:26.125 --> 00:28.083
The type of guy
that stands out in a crowd.

00:28.166 --> 00:31.375
Hello? Have you seen my new scarf?
It looks like a snake.

00:35.041 --> 00:38.500
- What's that smell?
- It smells like actual food.

00:38.750 --> 00:40.291
This is the school cafeteria.

00:40.375 --> 00:42.375
It is no place for actual food.

00:46.667 --> 00:47.792
It's them.

00:52.166 --> 00:55.166
Here we go. The start of football season.

00:55.250 --> 00:56.959
Look at them with their prime rib.

00:57.041 --> 00:59.041
They think they're so much better than us.

00:59.583 --> 01:01.834
Ooh, I'm going to go ask that guy
if I can eat his fat.

01:01.917 --> 01:03.000
Sit down!

01:04.875 --> 01:07.041
You know, their quarterback
just moved away,

01:07.125 --> 01:09.291
and they're holding tryouts
to find a replacement.

01:10.166 --> 01:11.041
Nice, I guess.

01:12.583 --> 01:13.625
Wait a minute!

01:14.375 --> 01:15.875
I think we all know there's someone

01:15.959 --> 01:18.125
sitting right at this table
that could replace him.

01:18.208 --> 01:20.709
- If I have to. I mean, come on.
- Well, I guess I could. I got muscles.

01:20.792 --> 01:22.834
I was talking about Jack, ya toads.

01:23.709 --> 01:27.542
I would love to, but between school
and karate and...

01:28.208 --> 01:29.875
I just got a turtle. It's a whole thing.

01:29.959 --> 01:31.792
The walking it alone takes forever.

01:33.166 --> 01:35.208
Jack, you're the most athletic
person we know.

01:35.291 --> 01:38.041
- The school needs a quarterback.
- And we need meat, man.

01:38.125 --> 01:40.834
Dude, what part of "got a turtle"
don't you understand?

01:42.458 --> 01:45.959
I tell you what, I'll even go with you
to the tryout for moral support.

01:46.041 --> 01:47.792
It doesn't just work like that, Milton.

01:47.875 --> 01:49.959
They don't let any kid tryout
for the football team.

01:50.041 --> 01:51.709
Coach Marmer, Jack would like to try out--

01:51.792 --> 01:53.667
Oh, great, Jack. We'll see you
tomorrow at 3:30 then.

01:56.291 --> 01:57.375
What just happened?

01:57.458 --> 01:59.959
I'd support you and the team
by joining the pep squad again,

02:00.041 --> 02:03.166
but, um, as you know,
Grace kicked me off for no reason.

02:03.250 --> 02:05.166
Uh, you drop-kicked our mascot.

02:06.208 --> 02:08.875
He was saying inappropriate things to me
through his blowhole.

02:10.750 --> 02:13.375
I belong on that pep squad,
front and center.

02:13.458 --> 02:14.291
And I'll say it.

02:14.792 --> 02:16.250
I like being looked at.

02:18.041 --> 02:19.667
Kim, you had your shot.

02:19.792 --> 02:22.041
Okay? Leave the pep to the professionals.

02:22.417 --> 02:25.125
- You have pep?
- Oh, I have pep, sister.

02:25.375 --> 02:26.875

Let's get going, Jack. Hustle it up.

03:37.583 --> 03:40.959
Milton, I'm just going down for a tryout.
Do I really have to wear this?

03:42.917 --> 03:45.000
Five yards for a bad attitude, fella.

03:46.458 --> 03:48.542
Sweet Moses, is it Halloween already?

03:49.041 --> 03:50.333
I gotta put out the raisins.

03:51.166 --> 03:53.291
No, no, no, Rudy. It's, uh...

03:53.375 --> 03:55.500
It's not Halloween.
Jack's tryout for the football team.

03:55.583 --> 03:57.667
Oh, I played a little pigskin.

03:58.000 --> 04:01.834
You're looking at the man responsible
for the tackle heard round the world.

04:01.917 --> 04:03.208
- Okay, see you later.--
- Gotta go--

04:03.291 --> 04:04.375
September 17th!

04:04.542 --> 04:06.667
City championship. Seaford up by six,

04:06.750 --> 04:08.041
ten seconds on the clock.

04:08.125 --> 04:13.125
Suddenly created high's legendary fullback
Bronco Wiznewski burst through the hole.

04:13.208 --> 04:14.500
As he raced for our end zone,

04:14.583 --> 04:17.417
I felt the weight of a city's dreams
on my shoulders.

04:17.500 --> 04:21.750
I hit him so hard, he spit out
his mouthpiece, his teeth and his pride.

04:22.500 --> 04:24.792
So wait, you won the championship?

04:24.875 --> 04:26.458
No, we forfeited.

04:26.959 --> 04:30.417
Apparently there's some rule you have
to be on the team to make a tackle.

04:30.500 --> 04:31.625
That's dumb.

04:31.959 --> 04:34.291
Jack, I'm so proud
you're going out for football.

04:34.375 --> 04:36.166
I, I want you to have something special.

04:40.083 --> 04:41.125
What is this?

04:41.208 --> 04:42.709
Bronco's mouthpiece.

04:42.875 --> 04:44.125
I'd give it a quick boil.

04:48.500 --> 04:50.583
Milton, I gotta let you in on something.

04:51.542 --> 04:53.083
I can't throw a football.

04:53.625 --> 04:55.542
- Can't or won't?
- Can't.

04:56.834 --> 04:58.834
- Can't or don't?
- Can't.

04:59.500 --> 05:02.250
- Can't or shan't?
- I can't throw a football, Milton!

05:02.959 --> 05:05.083
Come on, Jack. I'm sure it's not that bad.

05:08.166 --> 05:09.291
Wow.

05:09.500 --> 05:13.250
When you say you can't
throw a football, you really can't!

05:17.583 --> 05:20.667
Jerry says Grace won't go out with me
because I'm not a flashy guy.

05:21.125 --> 05:24.250
Well, there are some girls that, when
you ask them out, you have to wow them.

05:24.333 --> 05:26.000
You know, do something
they'll never forget.

05:26.083 --> 05:27.083
Really?

05:27.917 --> 05:29.250
Something big, huh?

05:29.333 --> 05:30.875
The first time I asked a girl out,

05:30.959 --> 05:34.500
it involved a dozen roses, some sparklers
and a hot air balloon.

05:34.583 --> 05:35.875
How'd that work out?

05:35.959 --> 05:36.875
She said yes.

05:37.208 --> 05:40.667
But she was allergic to the roses,
the sparklers set her hair on fire.

05:40.750 --> 05:43.250
And as I drifted away in the balloon,
I looked down and saw her going--

05:46.667 --> 05:48.458
Got it, Rudy. Go big!

05:48.542 --> 05:49.500
Yeah.

05:50.542 --> 05:52.291
Hey, Rudy.

05:52.875 --> 05:54.166
Look at those guys.

05:54.250 --> 05:55.458
<i>They have to sit together.</i>

05:55.542 --> 05:58.500
Clearly the whales are
controlling their brains.

05:59.375 --> 06:00.542
They're fans, Phil.

06:00.625 --> 06:02.917
They just dress that way
because they're excited about their team.

06:03.041 --> 06:04.000
I don't understand.

06:04.959 --> 06:08.166
Well, if you're really a sports fan,
you're not afraid to show it.

06:08.250 --> 06:10.166
You know, you might wear
a stuffed animal on your head,

06:10.250 --> 06:12.166
shave the number "1" In your chest hair,

06:12.250 --> 06:14.542
shout hateful things at total strangers.

06:15.125 --> 06:16.917
It's what makes this country so special.

06:17.583 --> 06:19.458
I think I get being a sports fan.

06:20.041 --> 06:22.375
Oh, he must be a fan of the Raccoons!

06:22.458 --> 06:26.000
Hey! Go, Raccoons! Go, Raccoons!
Go, Raccoons!

06:26.083 --> 06:27.041
Phil!

06:27.125 --> 06:28.834
That's not a raccoon. That's a toupee.

06:29.125 --> 06:30.583
Oh, I'm so sorry.

06:30.667 --> 06:32.542
Go, Toupees! Go, Toupees!

06:34.667 --> 06:37.125
All right, people, it's open tryouts
for the pep squad,

06:37.208 --> 06:38.458
which means we have to see...

06:38.917 --> 06:39.917
everyone.

06:41.375 --> 06:44.250
Oh, it's our old friend Kim Crawford.

06:44.834 --> 06:46.083
Hide the mascot.

06:47.875 --> 06:50.125
All right, Jerry, you're up next.

06:50.208 --> 06:51.083
What are you going to do?

06:51.458 --> 06:52.834
I'm going to do two handsprings,

06:52.917 --> 06:55.291
hit the mini tramp and come down
with a perfect landing.

06:55.625 --> 06:57.625
In other words, it's gonna be
sweet and awesome.

06:57.750 --> 07:00.125
"Swasome."

07:05.000 --> 07:05.875
Yeah.

07:11.125 --> 07:12.250
Whoo!

07:15.000 --> 07:16.458
Not gonna happen, Jerry.

07:16.542 --> 07:17.792
And about your pits...

07:18.208 --> 07:19.417
get help.

07:30.417 --> 07:31.625
What are you doing?

07:31.709 --> 07:33.000
You scared the daylights out of me.

07:33.083 --> 07:35.291
You look like that thing
that lived in my mattress, only...

07:35.834 --> 07:36.917
smaller.

07:37.291 --> 07:40.542
I decided to listen to what you say
and become a sports fan.

07:40.875 --> 07:42.667
I am a crayfish.

07:43.792 --> 07:45.625
No, no. You can't be a crayfish.

07:45.709 --> 07:48.125
That's the mascot of our arch enemies
Creighten High.

07:48.208 --> 07:49.625
We're playing them next Friday.

07:49.709 --> 07:52.625
Oh, I didn't know this.
I just love crayfish.

07:52.709 --> 07:55.583
Are they a little lobster?
Are they a big bug?

07:55.667 --> 07:58.625
All I know is they're always down
to party, baby.

07:59.709 --> 08:00.583
No.

08:00.667 --> 08:03.000
I demand you take off that heinous outfit.

08:03.083 --> 08:04.750
You are in whale country.

08:05.667 --> 08:08.208
You know, I never really liked whales.

08:10.000 --> 08:13.125
Who they think they are
with their fancy hole blows?

08:13.375 --> 08:16.000
And the stupid way they communicate!

08:19.291 --> 08:20.250
You take that back.

08:24.083 --> 08:25.542
You're crossing a line, man.

08:28.041 --> 08:30.625
That's it! Bring it! Bring it! Bring it!

08:30.792 --> 08:33.125
<i>♪ Kickin' it with you ♪</i>

08:34.834 --> 08:36.875
Oh, dude, I'm totally getting
the hang of this.

08:36.959 --> 08:39.000
- I hit the tire!
- That was great.

08:39.083 --> 08:41.959
But with a small adjustment
you can make it through the tire.

08:42.709 --> 08:44.875
- Really?
- It's simple physics.

08:45.333 --> 08:48.166
The ball is a spheroid,
so if you release it at a 40 degree angle

08:48.250 --> 08:51.208
while pronating your hand,
you'll eradicate wind resistance.

08:51.291 --> 08:53.583
Yeah, that's totally what I was thinking.

08:57.792 --> 08:59.417
You did it! You got it through the tire!

08:59.500 --> 09:01.083
I'm a natural pronator!

09:03.542 --> 09:04.667
All right, Jack,

09:04.750 --> 09:06.458
let me see you hit Murphy in the end zone.

09:06.542 --> 09:08.291
Oh, Murphy?! Come on, coach.

09:08.417 --> 09:10.583
He's never gonna catch it.
Look at him down there.

09:10.667 --> 09:12.917
He's got those tiny, little T-rex hands.

09:13.166 --> 09:14.667
Milton! I got it.

09:19.375 --> 09:21.542
Jack, that was a perfect throw.
He caught it.

09:22.083 --> 09:23.625
Great catch, Murphy.

09:27.083 --> 09:28.959
Jack, you did it. He's gotta go with you.

09:29.291 --> 09:30.917
Nah, I'm going with Mike Reynolds.

09:31.542 --> 09:32.542
What?

09:32.625 --> 09:35.208
But he threw the ball perfectly
to that little-fingered freak!

09:35.291 --> 09:36.500
Yeah, sorry.

09:37.542 --> 09:39.542
That is so unfair!

09:44.458 --> 09:45.375
Whoa!

09:46.166 --> 09:47.750
You just kicked a 50-yard field goal.

09:47.834 --> 09:48.750
What's your name, nerd?

09:49.417 --> 09:50.583
Milton Krupnick.

09:50.709 --> 09:53.250
Krupnick, you're our new kicker.
You're starting Friday's game.

09:54.417 --> 09:55.792
Do you know what this means?

09:56.542 --> 09:58.667
Yeah, I know exactly what this means.

09:59.750 --> 10:00.792
I'm a jock!

10:01.125 --> 10:04.375
- Come with me.
- Ow, take it easy. Ow, ow!

10:04.458 --> 10:06.667
<i>♪ It's not as cool
As kickin' it with you ♪</i>

10:09.208 --> 10:11.250
Dude, you missed
the best part of the game.

10:11.333 --> 10:13.834
Milton drilled a 45 yarder
right into the wind.

10:13.917 --> 10:17.041
Why do the good things always happen
when I'm in the port-a-pooper?

10:18.083 --> 10:21.083
Yeah, we're the Krupnick party.
He's meeting us here.

10:22.417 --> 10:23.458
We're with The Foot, hon.

10:26.750 --> 10:27.959
No way.

10:32.166 --> 10:33.458
Hey, can you smell that?

10:34.291 --> 10:35.917
That's the smell of fancy.

10:38.000 --> 10:39.959
I made it, grandma! I made it!

10:41.417 --> 10:42.709
Thanks to Milton,

10:42.792 --> 10:45.166
we're in for a whole new life at school.

10:45.250 --> 10:48.583
You are not kidding. Mr. Bauer gave me
detention for riding my skateboard.

10:48.709 --> 10:50.083
But when I dropped Milton's name,

10:50.208 --> 10:51.792
poof, it went away.

10:52.625 --> 10:53.834
Oh, that's nothing.

10:53.917 --> 10:55.625
Guess who made the pep squad?

10:55.709 --> 10:57.333
I thought Grace wasn't gonna let you in.

10:57.417 --> 11:01.375
She wasn't. But Milton made a phone call
and two spots magically opened up.

11:01.458 --> 11:04.000
All this one has to do
is shave his pit poodles.

11:05.417 --> 11:06.291
I'm not doing it.

11:06.375 --> 11:08.041
- Yes, you are.
- Told you I'm not doing it.

11:08.125 --> 11:10.667
- You're gonna do it i you wanna...
- I like my pits. It's manly. No way.

11:10.750 --> 11:11.792
-
- Ow!

11:11.875 --> 11:12.875
Fine.

11:13.709 --> 11:17.250
All right, everybody,
I have used game socks.

11:17.291 --> 11:21.125
Foot, Foot, Foot!

11:30.417 --> 11:31.959
Hey, Milton. Coming from practice?

11:32.291 --> 11:33.792
No, history.

11:33.875 --> 11:36.583
The Russian revolution
really takes a lot out of me.

11:38.583 --> 11:39.917
Are you wearing one of my Uggs?

11:40.959 --> 11:42.041
I sure am.

11:42.125 --> 11:45.458
When you have a loaded gun,
you have to keep it in a holster, honey.

11:48.542 --> 11:50.959
Ooh, shrimp cocktail, my favorite.

11:52.125 --> 11:53.166
Oh, hey, Milton,

11:53.250 --> 11:55.500
I came up with a really cool way
to impress Grace.

11:55.583 --> 11:57.709
All I need is to be
the scoreboard operator.

11:58.000 --> 11:59.208
I got you.

11:59.291 --> 12:02.083
Hey, Coach! Can my friend Eddie be
our scoreboard operator?

12:02.166 --> 12:03.083
What, you mean this nerd?

12:05.583 --> 12:06.458
You got it, Foot.

12:08.750 --> 12:10.917
Hey, Milton. Are you gonna make it
to karate practice today?

12:11.583 --> 12:13.166
I had study group at 3:00.

12:13.250 --> 12:17.083
Had to push that back due to an interview
with the school paper.

12:19.208 --> 12:20.583
Sorry, not gonna happen.

12:21.458 --> 12:23.208
Hey, Milton! Team pictures.

12:23.291 --> 12:24.125
Gotta go.

12:26.792 --> 12:27.792
See you, guys.

12:27.917 --> 12:29.417
- See you, my man.
- Peace out.

12:31.083 --> 12:33.959
Oh, ho, ho. Just a little
off the end there.

12:34.041 --> 12:34.917
Yeah.

12:36.041 --> 12:37.250
Perfect.

12:59.792 --> 13:01.667
What are you doing here?

13:01.750 --> 13:03.458
What did you do to this place?

13:03.542 --> 13:05.750
I told you, this is whale country!

13:06.583 --> 13:08.208
This may be whale country,

13:08.959 --> 13:10.959
but you are standing in The Crayfish Den!

13:13.792 --> 13:16.709
Oh, really? Well, if I was standing
in The Crayfish Den,

13:16.792 --> 13:19.041
then why would I be singing
The Seaford Fight Song?

13:19.125 --> 13:20.125
Don't you dare!

13:20.208 --> 13:23.500
<i>♪ Seaford Whales, we stand united
Largest mammals in the sea ♪</i>

13:23.583 --> 13:24.792
Crayfish, cover your ears.

13:24.875 --> 13:28.625
<i>♪ Here to fight and spread our glory,
Swimming towards our victory ♪</i>

13:28.709 --> 13:30.000
Crayfish attack!

13:30.083 --> 13:32.750
<i>♪ Spout your blowholes in the morning
Spout your blowholes... ♪</i>

13:33.709 --> 13:35.125
Stop pinching me!

13:37.041 --> 13:39.583
No, no, Kim, you can't do it, please.

13:39.709 --> 13:41.250
Come on, stop being such a baby.

13:41.333 --> 13:43.333
It's the only way she's gonna let you in.

13:43.417 --> 13:45.792
I think you made
the right decision, Jerry.

13:45.875 --> 13:48.375
- Kim, grip it and rip it.
- I changed my mind.

13:48.458 --> 13:50.250
No grip, no rip! Don't do it!

13:53.083 --> 13:54.417
I can't believe it.

13:54.500 --> 13:56.291
I didn't even put a dent in it.

14:00.041 --> 14:02.792
The Farrington comet is gonna
break orbit in three hours!

14:02.917 --> 14:05.458
We've been preparing for this
since we were seven.

14:07.625 --> 14:09.000
You don't think I'm disappointed?

14:09.083 --> 14:11.959
I'm the only kid in town that has
Farrington comet bedsheets!

14:13.125 --> 14:14.917
I can't go, I have to study.

14:16.125 --> 14:17.959
Look what I got on my Calculus quiz!

14:18.917 --> 14:19.834
<i>What is that?</i>

14:20.375 --> 14:21.417
It's a "B."

14:23.542 --> 14:25.834
We don't know who you are anymore.

14:27.709 --> 14:28.750
Neither do I.

14:30.000 --> 14:31.125
I need to quit the team.

14:31.208 --> 14:32.166
<i>Hey, Milton.</i>

14:32.250 --> 14:34.208
What are you doing here?
Shouldn't you be at practice?

14:34.291 --> 14:36.083
Yeah, I needed a little time to study.

14:36.166 --> 14:39.834
At school, everywhere I turn it's
"The Foot, The Foot, The Foot!"

14:39.917 --> 14:42.000
Isn't it awesome? Everyone loves you.

14:42.083 --> 14:43.750
I mean, the thing is
that's great and all, but--

14:43.834 --> 14:44.917
Oh man, I forgot to tell you.

14:45.000 --> 14:46.792
You know those tickets
you gave me for homecoming?

14:46.875 --> 14:48.750
I gave them to Tony from the Pizza Palace.

14:48.834 --> 14:51.250
Free garlic nuggets for life!

14:54.583 --> 14:55.917
That's great, Jack. But seriously--

14:56.000 --> 14:59.458
You getting on that football team is the
greatest thing to happen to any of us.

14:59.542 --> 15:01.792
Hey, hey, hey, which one
do you like better...

15:02.291 --> 15:05.291
"Milton's Militia"
or "Krupnick's Krazies"?

15:06.709 --> 15:08.583
Wow, you made T-shirts?

15:08.667 --> 15:10.959
Uh, yeah! Having a football star
in my dojo

15:11.041 --> 15:12.792
is like the coolest thing
that's ever happened.

15:13.000 --> 15:14.291
What about Jack's epic battle with

15:14.375 --> 15:16.291
the third-degree black belt
on the great wall of china?

15:16.375 --> 15:17.500
Lame!

15:18.792 --> 15:20.583
So? Eh, eh?

15:22.917 --> 15:25.000
<i>♪ Kickin' it with you ♪</i>

15:25.667 --> 15:27.667
Coach wanted me to bring you up here,
show you the ropes.

15:28.125 --> 15:29.083
There they are.

15:31.000 --> 15:32.875
- Pretty nice ropes.
- You're darn tooting.

15:33.542 --> 15:35.917
The only reason I'm doing this
is to impress a girl.

15:36.375 --> 15:38.959
I'm gonna ask her out from up here
during Friday night's game.

15:39.583 --> 15:40.959
I did the same thing from up here.

15:41.458 --> 15:43.000
I asked a girl out from right up here.

15:43.083 --> 15:45.375
Actually it was just a seagull
that was flying by,

15:45.458 --> 15:47.750
but I screamed at it.
I was like, "Will you go out with me?"

15:49.250 --> 15:50.959
Well, you think this has
a chance of working?

15:51.041 --> 15:52.792
Yes, I do.

15:52.875 --> 15:54.125
You know why?

15:54.208 --> 15:56.333
They do not give a ring of keys
like this to just anybody.

15:56.417 --> 15:57.458
-
- Hey!

15:59.041 --> 16:00.625
Eddie, you're an original. You know that?

16:00.709 --> 16:02.333
You're just putting it all out there.

16:02.375 --> 16:05.000
And if this girl doesn't appreciate you,
she doesn't deserve you.

16:05.625 --> 16:07.041
We're gonna do this. You and me.

16:07.125 --> 16:08.917
Come on, up top, Eddie! Yeah!

16:09.000 --> 16:10.583
Whoa!

16:11.792 --> 16:12.667
<i>I'm okay!</i>

16:21.667 --> 16:23.000
Rudy, you really went for it.

16:23.458 --> 16:24.458
Absolutely.

16:24.542 --> 16:26.834
Check out what's gonna happen
every time we score.

16:29.458 --> 16:30.959
That was my blowhole!

16:32.500 --> 16:36.125
Rudy, that has gotta be the most
ridiculous outfit I've ever seen in...

16:36.875 --> 16:39.333
- and I spoke too soon.
- Crayfish coming through!

16:39.417 --> 16:40.458
Rolling hot.

16:41.750 --> 16:43.709
Look what washed in in low tide.

16:43.792 --> 16:46.500
Rudy, they ran out of tickets.
Please, can I sit next to you?

16:46.583 --> 16:48.125
You won't hear a pippich out of me.

16:48.291 --> 16:50.542
<i>Milton Krupnick lines up
for a 42 yarder,</i>

16:50.625 --> 16:52.375
<i>His third field goal of the game.</i>

16:53.083 --> 16:55.625
Okay, I'm going to try to distract him
so he misses it!

16:55.709 --> 16:56.625
Hey!

16:56.709 --> 16:58.709
-
<i>Here's the snap...</i>

16:59.917 --> 17:01.583
<i>And the kick is good!</i>

17:02.917 --> 17:04.542
Yeah, no, good, good.

17:04.625 --> 17:06.125
No, I wanted him to make it. That's great.

17:06.208 --> 17:08.458
<i>That's a time-out on the field.</i>

17:08.792 --> 17:10.083
Okay, it's show time.

17:10.166 --> 17:11.500
- I'm going up.
- Wait, what?

17:11.583 --> 17:13.250
What are you talking...
No, no, no, wait wait.

17:13.333 --> 17:15.667
Quit it. Ow, ow, what?

17:16.875 --> 17:19.125
- Give me an "S"!
S!

17:19.208 --> 17:21.333
- Give me an "E"!
E!

17:21.417 --> 17:23.083
Give me a... help!

17:24.750 --> 17:26.333
Aha! That's a riot!

17:26.375 --> 17:29.125
That girl just took a header
into a sousaphone.

17:30.083 --> 17:32.458
When I get this thing off my head,
you're dead, Jerry!

17:33.208 --> 17:34.667
I'm pretty sure that was Kim.

17:35.458 --> 17:37.625
It's even funnier now, 'cause I know her.

17:39.875 --> 17:42.000
Dude, dude, dude, she's looking up here.
Go, man, go!

17:43.083 --> 17:44.667
What's he doing up there?

17:46.375 --> 17:47.709
Oh man, I don't think she can read it.

17:47.792 --> 17:49.250
Here, I'll call it out. Grace!

17:50.875 --> 17:52.208
"Will you

17:52.875 --> 17:55.542
go out...

17:56.375 --> 17:58.041
with me?"

17:58.667 --> 18:00.583
Not me, him! Eddie. With Eddie.

18:01.959 --> 18:03.875
Dude, she's smiling.
I think she's into it.

18:03.959 --> 18:05.083
Whoa!

18:07.208 --> 18:10.917
<i>Attention both sides, would you
please direct your eyes to the scoreboard.</i>

18:11.000 --> 18:13.959
<i>Some kid named Eddie has given himself
a massive wedgie.</i>

18:22.000 --> 18:24.875
Aww, Eddie almost killed himself for me.

18:25.375 --> 18:26.959
That is so sweet.

18:27.458 --> 18:29.875
Yes, Eddie! I'll go out with you!

18:30.542 --> 18:31.500
Hey--

18:34.417 --> 18:36.125
<i>The Whales take a time-out.</i>

18:36.208 --> 18:38.792
<i>A 52-yard field goal will win it for 'em.</i>

18:38.875 --> 18:43.458
<i>Longest in Seaford history, and it looks
like they're going to bring in "The Foot."</i>

18:44.083 --> 18:45.875
-
- Hey, Milton, check it out.

18:46.041 --> 18:47.875
I got free popcorn just for knowing you!

18:48.750 --> 18:50.250
Hey, are you okay?

18:50.792 --> 18:51.792
Not really.

18:52.291 --> 18:53.291
What's the matter?

18:53.667 --> 18:56.875
Every time I look at the football, I think
of all the things I'd rather be doing.

18:57.959 --> 18:59.250
Well, then why are you on the team?

18:59.709 --> 19:02.417
Look around you, Jack.
I'm doing it for you guys.

19:03.250 --> 19:04.125
What?

19:04.500 --> 19:05.583
You said it yourself.

19:05.667 --> 19:06.792
Me getting on the football team

19:06.875 --> 19:08.750
was the best thing
that ever happened to you guys.

19:09.125 --> 19:12.500
I mean, because of me,
Kim and Jerry made the pep squad,

19:12.750 --> 19:14.291
Eddie got a date with Grace.

19:14.375 --> 19:17.125
And when's the last time
you saw Rudy look so happy?

19:19.250 --> 19:21.083
Out me blowhole!

19:24.417 --> 19:26.291
Man, I didn't realize that we were all

19:26.375 --> 19:28.125
getting something out of it
except for you.

19:28.500 --> 19:30.125
None of us would want you to be unhappy.

19:30.667 --> 19:33.125
So you guys would be okay
if "The Foot" Walked away?

19:33.750 --> 19:35.291
Dude, as long as you're happy.

19:36.291 --> 19:38.125
- Thanks, Jack.
- Go get 'em, krupnick.

19:38.208 --> 19:39.750

19:40.000 --> 19:41.583
<i>Here it is, the final kick.</i>

19:41.667 --> 19:45.792
<i>If he makes this, Milton Krupnick will be
a Seaford high legend.</i>

19:46.500 --> 19:50.750
Foot! Foot! Foot!

19:52.959 --> 19:54.417
<i>Here's the snap.</i>

20:12.583 --> 20:13.458
Way to go, man.

20:14.375 --> 20:15.709
Milton, you did it! We won the game.

20:15.792 --> 20:17.625
- Party at my house.
- Yeah, you know...

20:17.709 --> 20:19.667
You guys go ahead,
get it started without me.

20:19.750 --> 20:21.041
- I'll catch you later.
- All right.

20:21.125 --> 20:23.000
Dude, Milton, that was awesome!

20:23.083 --> 20:24.083
You did it.

20:24.166 --> 20:26.000
And even though you're retiring
from the team,

20:26.083 --> 20:28.041
You should go celebrate the victory
with your guys.

20:28.583 --> 20:29.959
I'm going to.

20:30.417 --> 20:31.500
With you guys.

20:31.583 --> 20:34.083
Whoo! Yeah!

20:34.417 --> 20:35.375

I didn't know you were here.

20:42.959 --> 20:43.917
Whoo!

20:46.166 --> 20:47.583
Sorry, Milton, that was my bad.

20:47.667 --> 20:49.333
Bro, did you know Dana was here? Whoo.

20:49.417 --> 20:52.333
She was looking good.
Yo, Dana, you don't mind my pits, right?

20:55.583 --> 20:57.709
Well, let's just find a team
that we can both root for.

20:58.166 --> 21:00.458
Um, the Springfield Meerkats?

21:01.000 --> 21:02.000
No, no, no.

21:02.083 --> 21:05.542
A pack of meerkats did unspeakable things
to my grandfather on a train.

21:07.000 --> 21:09.000
How about the Long Branch Stallions?

21:09.083 --> 21:10.041
Nah, can't do it.

21:10.125 --> 21:13.083
I was horseback riding once
and got knocked off by a long branch.

21:14.625 --> 21:16.166
How about the Brookfield Bears?

21:18.375 --> 21:20.542
- I like bears.
- Yeah, I'm down with that.

21:20.625 --> 21:21.917
- Smoothies?
- Yeah!
