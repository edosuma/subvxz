00:00.133 --> 00:03.446
- <i>Previously on</i> Ravenswood...
- Look out!

00:03.469 --> 00:05.201
She could have killed us.

00:05.203 --> 00:08.738
- What happened? - It wasn't my fault.
Miranda grabbed the wheel.

00:08.740 --> 00:09.632
There must have been something
in the road.

00:09.643 --> 00:11.653
There was nothing in the road.
I would have seen it.

00:12.910 --> 00:16.379
4:02.

00:16.381 --> 00:18.314
I made it clear to Remy,
now I'll make it clear to you.

00:18.316 --> 00:21.150
I want you and your sister
to stay away from my daughter.

00:21.152 --> 00:23.419
Three wars,
no soldiers die,

00:23.421 --> 00:25.320
but when the wars are over
and the soldiers come home

00:25.322 --> 00:27.022
something happens to
five kids in town.

00:27.024 --> 00:28.390
Explain that.

00:28.392 --> 00:30.225
Everyone else in my unit
is gone.

00:30.227 --> 00:32.594
I don't even know why I'm here.

00:32.595 --> 00:36.130
It doesn't make any sense that I'm the
only one that survived the attack.

00:36.132 --> 00:38.966
It worked. I heard you
reading my mom's letter.

00:38.968 --> 00:41.169
I just followed your voice.

00:41.171 --> 00:42.736
Do they know?
Know what?

00:42.738 --> 00:45.606
That you're back.
Caleb, I'm not back.

00:45.608 --> 00:48.709
I'm... I'm dead.

00:50.000 --> 00:56.074

01:42.960 --> 01:45.562
Nice turnout
for my funeral.

01:47.698 --> 01:50.234
I'm glad you're still here.

01:50.236 --> 01:52.836
Does it feel
any different today?

01:52.838 --> 01:56.272
You mean have I seen a
bright light in the tunnel?

01:56.274 --> 01:59.208
No. It's like that time
in the first grade

01:59.210 --> 02:01.377
my foster mom forgot to
pick me up from school.

02:01.379 --> 02:04.713
I'm just...
Sitting on the curb,

02:04.715 --> 02:06.715
waiting.

02:11.221 --> 02:13.788
Well, hey, you're not alone.

02:13.790 --> 02:17.091
Whatever this is...
curse, pattern...

02:17.093 --> 02:19.093
we're gonna figure it out
together.

02:21.297 --> 02:22.864
Thanks.

02:28.503 --> 02:31.438
Mr. Collins' old suit
fits you nicely.

02:31.440 --> 02:32.973
I knew that it would.

02:32.975 --> 02:35.309
Yeah, it's, uh, pretty spiffy.

02:38.380 --> 02:40.113
At least you can
take yours off.

02:40.115 --> 02:42.716
I didn't even get to pick
the dress I'm buried in.

02:44.485 --> 02:46.286
Who are they again?

02:46.288 --> 02:49.088
I'm terrible with names.

02:51.091 --> 02:53.326
It's Luke and Olivia Matheson.

02:53.328 --> 02:56.162
You didn't exactly meet them.

02:56.164 --> 02:58.964
No. I just died with them.

03:11.043 --> 03:12.944
You okay, mom?

03:12.946 --> 03:15.046
I'm fine.

03:21.420 --> 03:23.187
Clark's here.

03:29.261 --> 03:31.829
I don't think he came
to pay respects.

03:31.831 --> 03:34.231
Come on. You guys
used to be friends.

03:34.233 --> 03:38.835
We played hockey together. Then
he picked a different team.

04:06.762 --> 04:09.697
Miranda was my sister Lilah's
daughter.

04:11.400 --> 04:12.734
I wish I'd known her better.

04:12.736 --> 04:14.802
He doesn't wish
he knew me better.

04:14.804 --> 04:16.704
He shut down every
conversation I tried to start.

04:16.706 --> 04:20.307
She was only seventeen...
Much too young.

04:20.309 --> 04:23.176
But when death came,
the worries ended.

04:23.178 --> 04:25.512
Her cares were put away.

04:25.514 --> 04:28.248
She's with the angels now.

04:28.250 --> 04:30.250
"She's with the angels now"?

04:30.252 --> 04:32.085
Really? Wow.

04:32.087 --> 04:34.621
Brief <i>and</i> unconvincing.

04:37.391 --> 04:39.558
It's okay. Just relax.

04:49.068 --> 04:50.469
It's not okay.

04:54.006 --> 04:55.707
Caleb, what if
I disappear forever?

05:02.214 --> 05:04.282
Don't let me go.

05:28.570 --> 05:33.876
<font color="#40bfff">Sync & corrections by</font> <font color="#FFA500">wilson0804</font>
<font color="#40bfff">www.Addic7ed.com</font>

05:50.059 --> 05:53.261
I can't believe her foster
family didn't come.

05:53.263 --> 05:56.832
Or her friends.
No one should be that alone.

05:56.834 --> 05:59.600
Is that why you're here?
So she's not alone?

05:59.602 --> 06:03.071
Just felt right. We were
all in the car with her.

06:03.073 --> 06:06.307
I don't know,
ever since the accident...

06:06.309 --> 06:09.643
what? I can't keep
calling it an accident.

06:09.645 --> 06:12.013
It's a part of the pattern
I was talking to you about.

06:12.015 --> 06:13.580
It's a lot bigger
than I first thought.

06:15.183 --> 06:16.850
Like how big?

06:16.852 --> 06:19.619
Like maybe there were supposed to
be five coffins out there today.

06:26.895 --> 06:29.561
Look, I know you want
to be here for her.

06:29.563 --> 06:31.563
But maybe we should go.

06:31.565 --> 06:32.899
You just lost your dad, and...

06:32.901 --> 06:35.234
I'm not going
to any dark place.

06:35.236 --> 06:38.437
Okay? I'm just sad
she's gone.

06:42.209 --> 06:44.743
Hey. How you doing?

06:44.745 --> 06:47.678
Um, a little worn out. I
haven't really slept much.

06:47.680 --> 06:50.681
I know. Every time I close my
eyes I'm back in the river.

06:53.286 --> 06:55.253
I thought you said
your folks were coming.

06:55.255 --> 06:56.454
My dad's here.

06:56.456 --> 06:59.157
My mom was dressed,
she was in the car.

06:59.159 --> 07:02.526
She didn't make it
past the driveway.

07:02.528 --> 07:04.628
She's still adjusting
to being stateside.

07:04.630 --> 07:06.430
It'll get better.
I hope so.

07:10.468 --> 07:11.601
I miss you.

07:13.471 --> 07:14.771
I don't care
what our parents say.

07:14.773 --> 07:16.907
I can't handle radio silence.

07:16.909 --> 07:18.308
We do have to talk.

07:18.310 --> 07:20.076
My mom's outside.
Coast is clear.

07:20.078 --> 07:21.377
- What's up?
- No, I mean,

07:21.379 --> 07:22.845
I have to talk to you
and Olivia both.

07:22.847 --> 07:25.081
Can you meet Caleb and me
at the vault around three?

07:25.083 --> 07:27.283
Great. Double date.

07:28.785 --> 07:30.153
My dad.

07:31.488 --> 07:32.988
I'll be there.

07:44.200 --> 07:45.968
Did you go to school
with the girl who died?

07:45.970 --> 07:49.637
No. I didn't know her.
She was a runaway.

07:49.639 --> 07:52.507
Probably came after Mr. Collins looking
for a little early inheritance.

07:52.509 --> 07:54.742
She just wanted to meet him.

07:54.744 --> 07:56.878
Did you know her?

07:56.880 --> 07:59.246
Yeah. She was beautiful.

08:01.083 --> 08:03.885
I didn't know her long, but...

08:03.887 --> 08:06.453
She was the kind of person
you didn't mind

08:06.455 --> 08:09.255
being stuck on a bus with
half the night.

08:09.257 --> 08:11.758
She had a wicked
sense of humor.

08:11.760 --> 08:14.461
I think she watched
a lot of movies.

08:14.463 --> 08:16.497
But she read books, too.

08:16.499 --> 08:18.866
Real books. Off pages.

08:21.235 --> 08:22.802
She loved stories.

08:24.671 --> 08:26.706
She had some of her own.

08:31.310 --> 08:34.078
I just...
Wish I could have heard more.

08:44.356 --> 08:47.057
We don't have
to do this here.

08:47.059 --> 08:48.993
We should get mom and go.

08:50.294 --> 08:51.395
Hold on.

08:51.397 --> 08:54.498
Hey, Clark?

08:54.500 --> 08:57.100
You mind telling your boss to leave
my mom alone for ten minutes?

08:57.102 --> 09:00.170
- It's a funeral, man. - Luke, take it easy.
I'm sorry about that.

09:00.172 --> 09:02.972
You guys even looking for the jerk who's
been vandalizing my parents' tombstone?

09:02.974 --> 09:05.675
Doing anything about that? Pretty
busy looking for your dad's killer.

09:05.677 --> 09:07.309
How's that going?

09:07.311 --> 09:10.072
We've been following up on some leads
related to a person of interest.

09:12.650 --> 09:13.716
You mean our mom.

09:13.718 --> 09:15.618
I can't confirm or deny that.

09:15.620 --> 09:17.687
What leads?

09:17.689 --> 09:21.156
We got a name from a couple of
witnesses at your dad's office.

09:21.158 --> 09:24.026
They heard your parents arguing
over a woman named Abby.

09:24.028 --> 09:27.162
- Do either of you know who that is?
- No. Why?

09:27.164 --> 09:30.766
Chief thinks your dad may have
been involved with this woman.

09:30.768 --> 09:33.268
Romantically?

09:33.270 --> 09:35.670
Our dad? That's...
that's ridiculous.

09:35.672 --> 09:38.338
You guys know the murder
looks like a crime of passion.

09:38.340 --> 09:40.775
The chief's putting
puzzle pieces together.

09:40.777 --> 09:42.376
Maybe they fit,
maybe they don't.

09:42.378 --> 09:44.779
Are they gonna arrest her?

09:44.781 --> 09:46.781
I've spoken
to your lawyer.

09:46.783 --> 09:49.316
These are false accusations!

09:49.318 --> 09:51.651
It was good to see you guys.

09:51.653 --> 09:54.054
I'm sorry it was like this.

09:58.325 --> 10:00.393
Do you really think
dad was having an affair?

10:00.395 --> 10:01.861
I don't want to
believe it either.

10:05.800 --> 10:08.433
Are you coming?

10:08.435 --> 10:10.202
I'll get a ride with Dillon.

10:10.204 --> 10:12.137
Get mom home.

10:51.677 --> 10:53.777
I'm coming!

11:11.827 --> 11:14.763
You really think I'm beautiful?

11:14.765 --> 11:17.465
Thought maybe you just said
that earlier to pull me back.

11:21.003 --> 11:22.704
You're back.

11:22.706 --> 11:24.405
That's all that matters.

11:24.407 --> 11:25.740
Yeah.

11:27.342 --> 11:29.710
I wish they hadn't
put me in the ground.

11:29.712 --> 11:31.211
I hate the dark.

11:31.213 --> 11:33.013
You're not gone.

11:33.015 --> 11:34.848
You mean it's just
my body in that hole?

11:34.850 --> 11:36.950
Sorry, I was kind of
attached to it.

11:36.952 --> 11:38.952
That didn't come out right.

11:38.954 --> 11:40.888
Came out very "Miranda."

11:40.890 --> 11:42.889
You know, you're handling this
really well.

11:44.725 --> 11:47.026
Uh, don't think
I didn't consider

11:47.028 --> 11:48.661
that I possibly
have a brain tumor

11:48.663 --> 11:50.396
and I'm just hallucinating you.

11:50.398 --> 11:54.067
Well, if I am your figment, at least
you could tell me what happens next.

11:54.069 --> 11:56.736
I'm still working on
what's already happened.

11:56.738 --> 11:58.537
Why this town is trying
to kill...

11:58.539 --> 12:01.173
it's okay, you can say it.

12:01.175 --> 12:05.010
Something in this town
is trying to kill you.

12:05.012 --> 12:07.145
All of you.

12:07.147 --> 12:09.681
Come on. I'm thinking
that Remy can help us

12:09.683 --> 12:11.016
figure out how to fight back.

12:11.018 --> 12:13.151
Let's hear what she has to say.

12:15.887 --> 12:17.588
Wait. Caleb?

12:17.590 --> 12:20.958
Something's happening.
It's not letting me pass.

12:28.299 --> 12:30.167
What?
You should go on.

12:30.169 --> 12:32.902
I'll, uh, I'll always find you.

12:32.904 --> 12:34.270
I hope.

12:53.823 --> 12:56.358
I don't think Miranda's
death was an accident.

12:56.360 --> 12:58.460
Of course
it was an accident.

12:58.462 --> 13:02.397
No. I mean it's a lot bigger than all of us.
It's a pattern.

13:02.399 --> 13:05.066
Ever since 1918,
Ravenswood vets

13:05.068 --> 13:06.834
have some home safely from war,

13:06.836 --> 13:09.937
even though the odds were
completely against them,

13:09.939 --> 13:11.806
and five kids died.

13:11.808 --> 13:14.375
There have been five incidents
in the last century.

13:14.377 --> 13:16.677
Ours was number six.

13:16.679 --> 13:17.945
Rem, I mean,

13:17.947 --> 13:20.647
teenagers die
in accidents all the time.

13:20.649 --> 13:24.017
But look at the big picture. The
kids <i>always</i> die within a week.

13:24.019 --> 13:26.352
Remy, when did your mom come home?
Last Monday.

13:26.354 --> 13:29.555
We went in the river
Saturday night.

13:29.557 --> 13:30.891
Don't blame her mom.

13:30.893 --> 13:33.026
I'm not talking
cause and effect.

13:33.028 --> 13:35.161
I'm just... Pointing out
the pattern.

13:35.163 --> 13:37.496
There were a bunch of people that
were killed in these two accidents.

13:37.498 --> 13:39.665
The mine explosion
after world war ii,

13:39.667 --> 13:41.834
and the building collapse
in 1953.

13:41.836 --> 13:45.137
The higher body count just
camouflages the five teens.

13:45.139 --> 13:47.572
Who's doing this
mysterious camouflaging?

13:47.574 --> 13:49.141
I wish I knew.

13:49.143 --> 13:52.510
I know it sounds crazy, but
Ravenswood has a reputation.

13:52.512 --> 13:55.146
We all know it. People say
this place is cursed.

13:55.148 --> 13:58.082
Maybe this is what
they're talking about.

14:03.155 --> 14:04.689
Sorry, Remy.

14:04.691 --> 14:07.224
I'm not shooting you down,
I-I just have to go.

14:17.501 --> 14:20.904
We don't have time for this. We
need to figure out who Abby is.

14:20.906 --> 14:23.505
And then what? I know the chief
thinks she might be the other woman,

14:23.507 --> 14:26.008
but she might know somebody
that could help us.

14:26.010 --> 14:27.810
She might even be a suspect.

14:30.180 --> 14:32.781
I'm leaving now.
Do what you want.

14:41.858 --> 14:45.327
Hey. Listen...

14:45.329 --> 14:47.595
I really want to
talk to you about this,

14:47.597 --> 14:51.499
but Olivia needs me right now,
so...

14:51.501 --> 14:52.633
I'm sorry.

14:54.370 --> 14:56.771
You don't have to buy
what I'm selling.

14:56.773 --> 14:59.039
But just be careful.

15:01.076 --> 15:02.243
Okay.

15:06.081 --> 15:07.915
Hey, um...

15:07.917 --> 15:11.252
There's one flaw
in your pattern.

15:11.254 --> 15:13.319
We didn't all die.

15:17.892 --> 15:20.861
Maybe I am that person
who sees doomsday patterns

15:20.863 --> 15:22.929
in crossword puzzles.

15:22.931 --> 15:26.400
You're not.
I see it too.

15:26.402 --> 15:29.702
What if my mom coming home really
did lead to Miranda's death?

15:29.704 --> 15:33.572
Hey, no one could ever blame
your mom for whatever this is.

15:34.875 --> 15:36.942
Miranda might.

15:44.693 --> 15:46.867
Maybe there's something in
dad's appointment book.

15:46.905 --> 15:48.906
Cops already looked
through his computer.

15:48.908 --> 15:51.441
Anyway, I don't think dad would put
those kind of dates in his datebook.

15:51.443 --> 15:53.210
Why are you always so ready
to believe the worst?

15:53.212 --> 15:56.513
Maybe because you can't consider
our dad might have been human,

15:56.515 --> 15:59.016
made a mistake.

15:59.018 --> 16:01.451
Hey, guys.

16:01.453 --> 16:04.088
What are you doing
with your dad's computer?

16:04.090 --> 16:06.488
Who's Abby, mom?

16:11.762 --> 16:13.462
Mom?

16:15.065 --> 16:16.799
Where'd you hear that name?

16:16.801 --> 16:19.235
Police are looking for her.

16:19.237 --> 16:22.470
The chief thinks she was
breaking up your marriage.

16:22.472 --> 16:25.406
Would you guys help me get the
rest of the bags out of the car?

16:25.408 --> 16:26.541
Who is she?

16:29.345 --> 16:34.182
Abby Wheeler was your
dad's girlfriend in high school.

16:34.184 --> 16:37.651
He said that she was
trying to contact him...

16:37.653 --> 16:42.723
Warn him that he was in danger because
of his suspicions about this town.

16:44.860 --> 16:47.862
Were they sleeping together?

16:47.864 --> 16:50.697
Abby's been dead
for over twenty years.

16:59.606 --> 17:01.507
Oh, hey there.

17:01.509 --> 17:04.978
Can you whip me up
some of your salad dressing?

17:04.980 --> 17:06.780
Daddy only likes
the store-bought stuff.

17:06.781 --> 17:09.114
Your father doesn't know
what he has.

17:13.920 --> 17:16.554
Did you eat after the funeral?

17:16.556 --> 17:18.723
I had a latte at the vault.

17:20.326 --> 17:22.928
I'm sorry about this morning.

17:25.164 --> 17:27.498
I wanted to be there for you...

17:27.500 --> 17:29.433
More than anything.

17:29.435 --> 17:32.003
Mom, you don't have to do
anything you don't want to do.

17:33.906 --> 17:36.073
I'm just happy that
you got some closure.

17:41.714 --> 17:43.647
That poor girl.

17:57.028 --> 17:58.961
Um...

18:01.298 --> 18:04.734
It catches me by surprise...

18:04.736 --> 18:06.369
Sometimes.

18:07.738 --> 18:12.508
I lost a lot of friends
all at once, but...

18:12.510 --> 18:14.476
I never went to the funerals.

18:16.479 --> 18:18.313
It was still real,

18:18.315 --> 18:24.886
but without the flowers
and the 21-gun salutes...

18:24.888 --> 18:27.522
I didn't have to
face the details.

18:29.358 --> 18:31.692
It's okay.

18:31.694 --> 18:33.327
You're home now.

18:38.467 --> 18:40.100
Safe in Ravenswood.

18:55.784 --> 18:58.050
Mrs. Grunwald said
you wanted to see me.

18:59.488 --> 19:02.120
Was that you out there
filling in the grave?

19:02.122 --> 19:06.425
It was. Is that really
part of your job?

19:06.427 --> 19:10.429
No. I had to let
the Springer kid go today.

19:10.431 --> 19:13.198
Apparently his girlfriend
called it quits

19:13.200 --> 19:16.935
and he broke into my liquor
cabinet to drown his sorrows.

19:16.937 --> 19:19.203
Again.

19:19.205 --> 19:21.372
I'm sorry to hear that.

19:23.975 --> 19:29.414
I wanted to thank you for what
you said about Miranda today.

19:29.416 --> 19:34.183
I wish I could have
spoken more eloquently, but...

19:34.185 --> 19:37.086
I didn't feel I earned it.

19:37.088 --> 19:39.656
No. You really didn't.

19:43.661 --> 19:46.630
So what's next for you?

19:46.632 --> 19:50.566
I don't know. I might stay
around town for a few days.

19:50.568 --> 19:52.735
Don't you have school?

19:52.737 --> 19:55.103
We're on a long break.

19:59.476 --> 20:00.776
Come with me.

20:05.815 --> 20:09.584
What is this place?
It was the carriage house.

20:09.586 --> 20:13.254
We converted the upstairs for the old
groundskeeper before he moved on.

20:14.824 --> 20:16.925
He died?

20:18.494 --> 20:21.228
Retired to Phoenix.

20:21.230 --> 20:22.896
Be careful on the stairs.

20:29.838 --> 20:33.039
So you're saying
I can stay here?

20:33.041 --> 20:34.908
For the moment...

20:34.910 --> 20:38.845
If you're willing to help out.

20:38.847 --> 20:41.413
Wouldn't have to learn how to
embalm or anything, would I?

20:44.751 --> 20:47.186
We'll start with weeding,

20:47.188 --> 20:49.021
cutting the grass,

20:49.023 --> 20:51.290
hauling markers
from the stonemason.

20:51.292 --> 20:52.658
There's even a jeep
you can use.

20:54.327 --> 20:55.427
Sounds doable.

20:57.063 --> 20:58.797
Thanks.

21:23.022 --> 21:25.523
I don't get that guy.

21:27.625 --> 21:28.958
What?

21:30.228 --> 21:32.429
He has room for you,
but not for me?

21:32.431 --> 21:34.297
Hey, it's temporary.

21:36.000 --> 21:38.768
I'm just happy to be
out of that house.

21:38.770 --> 21:41.905
Ah, shower. No tub.

21:41.907 --> 21:43.406
Now we're talkin'.

21:43.408 --> 21:45.807
You still think my Uncle
tried to drown you?

21:45.809 --> 21:48.144
No. I think that
whatever you saw on the bridge

21:48.146 --> 21:50.279
has been after us
since day one.

22:07.463 --> 22:09.230
These were my mother's things.

22:13.001 --> 22:15.269
I don't know anything
about the afterlife,

22:15.271 --> 22:19.239
but... Part of me's been hoping
she'd show up now that I'm dead,

22:19.241 --> 22:22.376
guide me to the other side.

22:22.378 --> 22:24.911
That's just insanely
hokey, right?

22:24.913 --> 22:27.347
But I haven't seen her
since I was a baby.

22:27.349 --> 22:31.317
No. I know what it's like
to want that connection.

22:35.322 --> 22:38.357
You know, I wish
I could just connect.

22:38.359 --> 22:40.326
With <i>anything.</i>

24:13.080 --> 24:14.962
***

24:27.319 --> 24:30.032
***

24:35.841 --> 24:37.409
Hey.

24:41.180 --> 24:44.181
Where have you been?

24:44.183 --> 24:47.785
I was in the house again.

24:47.787 --> 24:51.254
That limbo space.
I was...

24:51.256 --> 24:54.558
Looking at my mother's picture,
but I wasn't alone.

24:59.129 --> 25:01.331
Was it that thing
from the bridge?

25:01.333 --> 25:02.765
I don't know.

25:05.168 --> 25:09.706
Maybe there's another spirit
stuck here like me.

25:09.708 --> 25:13.108
Whoever they were, they didn't
want to be friends.

25:33.528 --> 25:35.763
What's that?

25:37.632 --> 25:39.467
Why aren't you in school?

25:39.469 --> 25:42.903
I haven't left yet. What are you watching?
Was that the attack?

25:42.905 --> 25:44.672
Does that have to do with mom?

25:44.674 --> 25:46.072
Where did you get it?
Did she...

25:46.074 --> 25:49.208
look, your mother
does know I have it.

25:49.210 --> 25:51.978
It was delivered yesterday
as part of her discharge.

25:51.980 --> 25:54.180
It's a summary of her service.
Has she seen it?

25:54.182 --> 25:55.882
No. And I don't think
she should.

25:55.884 --> 25:57.950
Dad, it's addressed to her.

25:57.952 --> 26:01.420
Your mother's talking with Dr. frankel
about taking over his practice.

26:01.422 --> 26:03.689
And getting back to normal,
this is what we need.

26:03.691 --> 26:06.558
I think we should let mom
decide what she needs.

26:06.560 --> 26:09.261
Let me worry
about your mother, okay?

28:31.017 --> 28:32.084
Hello?

28:33.686 --> 28:35.054
Mom?

28:40.626 --> 28:43.362
Hey. Have you been avoiding me?
What's going on?

28:43.364 --> 28:45.097
We gotta figure out
what to tell the cops.

28:45.099 --> 28:47.565
Mom told me she lied
when they asked her about Abby,

28:47.567 --> 28:50.268
but if they understand she was just
trying to protect dad's reputation...

28:50.270 --> 28:52.236
- Dad wasn't crazy.
- I know,

28:52.238 --> 28:54.605
but a prosecutor can twist the
facts, make it seem like he's crazy.

28:54.607 --> 28:57.175
Mom said dad thought
Abby was trying to contact him.

28:57.177 --> 28:58.542
I-I think she was.

29:00.112 --> 29:02.813
How could you know that?

29:02.815 --> 29:06.183
Because I-I think
she's trying to contact <i>me.</i>

29:13.724 --> 29:16.226
Abby Wheeler's dead, Liv.

29:21.098 --> 29:23.432
I saw Abby at
the funeral yesterday.

29:23.434 --> 29:25.701
She was standing
by dad's grave.

29:25.703 --> 29:28.971
- Maybe it was somebody who looked like her.
- No. It was her. Okay?

29:28.973 --> 29:32.208
I went to the science lab
where she died. I saw...

29:34.444 --> 29:36.011
- Hey. It's okay.
- I...

29:36.013 --> 29:38.313
It's okay.

29:38.315 --> 29:41.116
I think she's part
of Remy's pattern,

29:41.118 --> 29:42.984
just like us.

29:45.420 --> 29:46.854
Olivia, I can't...

29:49.391 --> 29:52.159
you can't possibly
believe this.

29:52.161 --> 29:53.928
I think dad did.

29:55.831 --> 29:58.031
I know it sounds insane,

29:58.033 --> 29:59.799
but you have to help me.

29:59.801 --> 30:01.735
I can't do this alone.

30:39.805 --> 30:42.440
Her whole unit was vaporized.

30:42.442 --> 30:43.908
How did she survive?

30:50.848 --> 30:53.416
<i>So you work</i>
<i>for Collins now?</i>

30:53.418 --> 30:57.353
It's not a career move. I just need to
stay long enough to get some answers.

30:57.355 --> 30:59.389
Thank you...
For believing me.

31:00.825 --> 31:02.692
There's something
you should know...

31:02.694 --> 31:04.026
About Miranda.

31:07.030 --> 31:08.297
Who is that?

31:10.033 --> 31:12.267
I'm ready to talk now.

31:16.573 --> 31:19.007
Okay, you guys
don't know me from Adam.

31:19.009 --> 31:20.809
But I'm a pretty rational guy.

31:20.811 --> 31:24.145
So this is...

31:24.147 --> 31:26.014
Not that easy to say.

31:31.787 --> 31:33.387
Miranda's still here.

31:36.591 --> 31:39.226
I've seen her.
I've talked to her.

31:41.796 --> 31:43.597
You mean her... ghost?

31:45.500 --> 31:47.835
Yeah.

31:49.803 --> 31:52.538
And I'm only telling you guys
this because she's in trouble.

31:52.540 --> 31:58.678
She's stuck here, and there
are other spirits, and...

31:58.680 --> 32:01.614
I just don't know
how to help her.

32:01.616 --> 32:03.716
You gotta be kidding me.

32:03.718 --> 32:06.584
- I believe you.
- Me too.

32:10.056 --> 32:12.257
Really?
Just like that?

32:12.259 --> 32:15.260
I told you, this is Ravenswood.

32:15.262 --> 32:17.796
I just found out my own
mom should be a ghost,

32:17.798 --> 32:19.898
but she isn't.

32:19.900 --> 32:22.700
You said
there were other spirits.

32:22.702 --> 32:25.235
Is there someone named Abby

32:25.237 --> 32:28.739
I don't know. I don't think
she took any names.

32:28.741 --> 32:30.741
Would she try making contact?

32:30.743 --> 32:33.878
I think this girl Abby
really wants to talk to me.

32:33.880 --> 32:36.246
Guys, hey.
Am I the only one

32:36.248 --> 32:38.281
living in the real world
right now?

32:38.283 --> 32:39.515
You didn't see the ghost?

32:41.485 --> 32:43.419
I'm just here for Liv.

32:45.189 --> 32:46.790
Give me that.

32:55.098 --> 32:58.000
I think my dad may have found
the meme pattern you did...

32:58.002 --> 33:00.402
maybe after Abby died.

33:00.404 --> 33:04.406
So wait. What makes you think that
Abby's trying to contact you?

33:04.408 --> 33:07.943
I've seen her. Twice.

33:07.945 --> 33:09.311
I don't know how I know,

33:09.313 --> 33:12.180
if it's in her eyes
or if she's in my head,

33:12.182 --> 33:14.648
but she's trying to
communicate... to warn us.

33:14.650 --> 33:17.318
Warn us about <i>what?</i>
We survived the crash.

33:17.320 --> 33:19.520
But it's not over, Luke.

33:19.522 --> 33:21.089
We've all felt it.

33:21.091 --> 33:23.357
Somebody's still waiting
to come after us.

33:25.127 --> 33:27.595
We need some answers.

33:31.633 --> 33:33.800
A seance?

33:33.802 --> 33:35.202
Are you serious?

33:37.839 --> 33:39.240
Yeah.

33:50.352 --> 33:52.821
Please don't
let them do this.

33:52.823 --> 33:55.355
These spirits, I don't think
they want to help anyone.

33:55.357 --> 33:57.290
One of them wants
to communicate.

33:57.292 --> 34:00.127
Olivia seems
really sure about this.

34:01.529 --> 34:03.363
I just have
a really bad feeling.

34:16.110 --> 34:19.445
Um, Miranda wants us
to be careful.

34:19.447 --> 34:21.246
Duly noted.

34:21.248 --> 34:24.717
Okay, everyone keep
your eyes and ears open.

34:24.719 --> 34:27.619
If anything gets weird,
say something. We'll stop.

34:36.228 --> 34:38.996
How do we start,
just call out her name?

34:38.998 --> 34:41.732
You've been to more
slumber parties than me.

34:41.734 --> 34:42.699
Just wing it.

34:47.205 --> 34:50.074
I want to talk to Abby Wheeler.

34:50.076 --> 34:54.244
My name's Olivia Matheson.
Charles was my father.

34:54.246 --> 34:56.413
I saw you at his grave.

35:11.896 --> 35:13.929
Are we doing it right?

35:13.931 --> 35:15.530
Abby...

35:16.867 --> 35:18.167
What was that?

35:32.815 --> 35:34.248
Caleb.

35:42.224 --> 35:43.925
Hello?

36:00.007 --> 36:02.241
Hello?

36:04.077 --> 36:05.745
Mr. Collins?

36:14.621 --> 36:17.123
Maybe we should...
Wait till he gets back.

36:23.896 --> 36:26.564
Abby, if you have something
to say, tell us.

36:30.637 --> 36:32.370
Guys, did you hear that?

36:36.775 --> 36:39.109
<i>Abby!</i>

36:40.544 --> 36:42.511
Stop it!

36:42.513 --> 36:44.881
Stop it!

36:44.883 --> 36:46.415
Shut up!

36:58.460 --> 37:00.695
Abby, are you out here?!

37:01.931 --> 37:04.032
Please, talk to us!

37:06.335 --> 37:07.869
Ohh!

37:20.015 --> 37:21.782
Please.

37:23.785 --> 37:26.553
They're so young.

37:26.555 --> 37:28.189
Just like you were.

37:29.523 --> 37:31.490
Just like me.

37:32.960 --> 37:35.295
Please don't let them die too.

38:28.379 --> 38:29.946
Hello?

38:35.019 --> 38:36.085
Abby?

38:38.788 --> 38:41.156
Abby, please talk to us.

38:41.158 --> 38:43.192
We need to know what
we're up against.

38:48.999 --> 38:50.765
Abby, are you here?

38:54.970 --> 38:57.471
Well, you did that, right?
I-I didn't.

38:58.707 --> 38:59.941
She's here.

39:02.912 --> 39:06.846
Abby, did my father discover
the curse of Ravenswood?

39:24.538 --> 39:26.071
Oh, it's unbelievable.

39:26.073 --> 39:29.142
I-I worked here
almost a year,

39:29.144 --> 39:31.444
and Collins wouldn't even let me
put my lunch in his fridge.

39:31.446 --> 39:35.114
You're here a week and you
get the keys to the kingdom.

39:35.116 --> 39:37.216
Abby, is my father with you?

39:44.757 --> 39:47.825
Is the curse what
got my father killed?

39:57.769 --> 40:01.172
Guys, you're making a lot of
noise on a really bad frequency.

40:04.476 --> 40:05.676
Someone's coming.

40:13.551 --> 40:16.586
Is my father's killer
trying to kill us?

40:39.242 --> 40:41.376
I'm done. I'm done. We can't stop.
We need answers.

40:41.378 --> 40:44.612
We need to figure out
<i>how</i> to stop it.

40:52.254 --> 40:53.721
Caleb, shut this down
right now!

40:53.723 --> 40:55.356
No, Remy's right.
We need answers, Miranda.

40:55.358 --> 40:56.324
Why is this happening?

41:18.845 --> 41:20.346
Guys, look out!

41:49.240 --> 41:50.374
Miranda?

42:10.960 --> 42:13.729
I told him the last
groundskeeper retired.

42:13.731 --> 42:15.665
It's probably for the best.

42:15.667 --> 42:18.567
He'll just think
the stains are rust.

42:22.471 --> 42:24.639
Is he having a party?

42:24.641 --> 42:26.708
He has guests.

42:28.043 --> 42:30.779
Perhaps the kind
he shouldn't be inviting.
