Probably not.

00:52.253 --> 00:53.685
Okay, this has gone on
too long.

00:53.687 --> 00:55.187
We need to talk to her.
Nobody goes in there
right now.

00:55.189 --> 00:57.056
At least tell us
what's going on.
No.

00:57.058 --> 00:58.724
Huck...
No!

00:58.726 --> 01:00.793
What he said.
Okay, well when you two
guard dogs get a chance,

01:00.795 --> 01:02.094
Please tell liv
that the marcus campaign

01:02.096 --> 01:04.329
Have been calling
all morning nonstop.

01:04.331 --> 01:06.832
Which job we're taking
or we're gonna lost them both!

01:06.834 --> 01:08.133
We just climbed out
of a money hole.

01:08.135 --> 01:09.501
It was dark and unpleasant
down there

01:09.503 --> 01:10.602
And we don't want to go back.

01:10.604 --> 01:12.204
(telephone rings)
you better get that.

01:12.206 --> 01:15.240
(ring)
(under breath)
stupid super spies.

01:15.242 --> 01:16.842
Olivia...

01:16.844 --> 01:19.111
(ring)

01:19.113 --> 01:20.846
Where are you going?

01:20.848 --> 01:22.748
This theory that
fitz's military record

01:22.750 --> 01:24.349
Was somehow trumped up
to hide the fact

01:24.351 --> 01:26.085
He shot down
a passenger plane--

01:26.087 --> 01:29.655
You know how crazy
that sounds?
Where are you going?

01:29.657 --> 01:32.091
There's probably
only two people in the world

01:32.093 --> 01:33.725
Who can tell me
if this really happened.

01:33.727 --> 01:36.595
And I can't ask him because he'd
probably kill both of you,

01:36.597 --> 01:39.631
To teach me some kind
of sick lesson.

01:39.633 --> 01:41.166
And the other's the president.

01:41.168 --> 01:42.501
So that's where I'm going--
to the white house

01:42.503 --> 01:45.704
To ask him myself.

01:45.706 --> 01:46.872

01:55.883 --> 02:00.052
Not enough blood for me. Maybe
if they lost the helmets...

02:00.054 --> 02:02.888
It's hard to say.
I'm more of a boxing fan.

02:02.890 --> 02:06.859
Take home the title.
Now I'll leave you to it.

02:06.861 --> 02:08.861
All right.
Bye, love.

02:08.863 --> 02:11.296

02:13.199 --> 02:15.834
Daniel douglas--
so fun to say.

02:15.836 --> 02:17.202
(whispers) daniel douglas.

02:17.204 --> 02:19.404
(chuckles) leo.
If I'm joe voter,

02:19.406 --> 02:21.874
Is he the charming frat boy

02:21.876 --> 02:24.376
Or the emasculated
potential date-raper?
Excuse me?

02:24.378 --> 02:27.513
Is he an asset or an obstacle
to the whole endeavor?

02:27.515 --> 02:33.352
But sometimes he's been known
to trip over his own two feet

02:33.354 --> 02:34.853
Along the way.

02:34.855 --> 02:36.288
In any case,
I thought we might discuss--

02:36.290 --> 02:38.390
Yes, okay, step one--
we build support.

02:38.392 --> 02:39.725
We shave off
the religious right,

02:39.727 --> 02:42.394
But we do it quietly
before you resign.
How?

02:42.396 --> 02:43.762
We fire a blank.

02:43.764 --> 02:45.330
I'm not sure I--
we hand out some
cable news airtime

02:45.332 --> 02:46.832
To disgruntled pastors
who say,

02:46.834 --> 02:48.834
In so many bitter
biblical heartfelt words,

02:48.836 --> 02:50.936
How fed up they are
with grant's penis problem.

02:50.938 --> 02:52.704
Cyrus beene will send me
out to deal--

02:52.706 --> 02:54.806
To reassure
the religious leaders.
That's right. You got it.

02:54.808 --> 02:56.441
And I make my rounds
to the mega-churches,

02:56.443 --> 02:58.777
And instead of appeasing
these disgruntled voices,

02:58.779 --> 03:01.413
I quietly make my case
for a langston ticket.

03:01.415 --> 03:03.215
Your own multi-state
campaign swing

03:03.217 --> 03:05.317
Endorsed by
the president himself.

03:06.953 --> 03:09.888
(projector and camera shutter

03:09.890 --> 03:11.857
(papers rustling)

03:11.859 --> 03:13.725
(door closes)

03:13.727 --> 03:15.460
Olivia's on her way.

03:15.462 --> 03:16.862
You don't haul yourself
all the way across town

03:16.864 --> 03:17.963
And slog through
white house security

03:17.965 --> 03:19.298
To turn down a job.

03:19.300 --> 03:21.934
This is...
"weird" isn't the right word.

03:21.936 --> 03:24.403
"strange." no... "greek."

03:24.405 --> 03:26.705
Mythic and disturbing.
This is winged horses.

03:26.707 --> 03:28.640
Wait, is it the horses
who had the wings that melted?

03:28.642 --> 03:29.875
Or I don't know.
I can't remember.
(sighs)

03:29.877 --> 03:31.543
My point is...

03:31.545 --> 03:33.946
This is a greek tragedy
in the making.

03:33.948 --> 03:36.815
(sighs)
winged mistresses flying
too close to the sun.

03:36.817 --> 03:39.218
She wins elections.
She wins elections.

03:39.220 --> 03:40.586
She wins elections.

03:40.588 --> 03:41.987
(sighs)

03:41.989 --> 03:45.257
You're welcome.

03:47.460 --> 03:48.794
Mr. President? Ma'am?

03:48.796 --> 03:49.861
Send her in.

03:49.863 --> 03:53.265
Olivia... Welcome back.

03:53.267 --> 03:57.736
Can I have a moment alone
with the president, please?

03:59.839 --> 04:02.307
Of course.

04:02.309 --> 04:05.010
I am sure you two
have things to discuss.

04:05.012 --> 04:07.879
We'll talk later, liv.
Get the ball rolling.

04:07.881 --> 04:10.649
This is gonna be good.

04:10.651 --> 04:13.452
Icarus--with the wings.
It was icarus who...

04:13.454 --> 04:14.820
Never mind.

04:27.600 --> 04:29.034
I'm surprised you're here.

04:29.036 --> 04:32.537
Happy, but surprised...

04:32.539 --> 04:34.306
And grateful.

04:36.476 --> 04:37.609
I know.

04:37.611 --> 04:40.545
I know you and I are not...

04:40.547 --> 04:42.814
(sighs)

04:42.816 --> 04:46.285
I want us to start over...

04:46.287 --> 04:49.288
Did you fly air support
for operation remington?

04:49.290 --> 04:51.023
What?

04:51.025 --> 04:52.791
Were you there,
flying air support

04:52.793 --> 04:56.628
Liv--
or were you flying another
mission someplace else?

04:56.630 --> 04:58.930
This isn't you talking.

04:58.932 --> 05:00.866
This is your boyfriend
jake talking.

05:00.868 --> 05:04.002
Just answer the question.
I don't know
what you're talking about.

05:04.004 --> 05:05.804
I need an answer--
I don't know
what you're talking about.

05:05.806 --> 05:09.341
I'm not asking you
to compromise national security.

05:09.343 --> 05:11.977
I'm asking, is it a lie?

05:11.979 --> 05:13.879
Are you lying
about your military record?

05:13.881 --> 05:15.547
Are you <i>lying</i> to me?

05:15.549 --> 05:16.948
Like you did with defiance?

05:19.419 --> 05:21.887
You want to talk to me
about life...

05:21.889 --> 05:24.022
About your boyfriend...

05:24.024 --> 05:27.959
About the upcoming election,
about the weather, great!

05:27.961 --> 05:29.528
I will tell you anything
you want to know.

05:29.530 --> 05:32.497
When it comes to you,
I'm an open book.

05:32.499 --> 05:35.667
But if you want to talk
about operation remington,

05:35.669 --> 05:36.968
You're not talking to me.

05:36.970 --> 05:38.637
You're talking
to the commander in chief

05:38.639 --> 05:39.938
Of the armed forces.

05:39.940 --> 05:41.807
You're talking to the leader
of the free world.

05:41.809 --> 05:43.608
So my only response to you

05:43.610 --> 05:45.977
Is that remington
is a highly classified

05:45.979 --> 05:49.948
Military operation,
which means it does not exist.

05:49.950 --> 05:51.483
So like I said,

05:51.485 --> 05:53.352
I don't know
what you're talking about.

06:02.995 --> 06:06.631
I can't work for you.

06:17.944 --> 06:19.378
I did everything but roll
your whore up in a rug

06:19.380 --> 06:22.381
I begged her.
I <i>bled</i> for this!

06:22.383 --> 06:24.783
It's done, mellie.
(panting)

06:24.785 --> 06:26.151
We find someone else.

06:26.153 --> 06:29.154
(exhales sharply)
you want to win?

06:29.156 --> 06:31.923
There is no one else.

06:35.395 --> 06:36.762
(sighs)

06:36.764 --> 06:38.930
Liv knows.

06:38.932 --> 06:40.632
About what?

06:40.634 --> 06:42.000
About remington.

06:42.002 --> 06:43.935
She knows, cy.

06:43.937 --> 06:46.738
She knows everything.

06:48.708 --> 06:51.777
(gunshots)

06:58.751 --> 06:59.918
(whirring)

06:59.920 --> 07:01.453
(projector and camera shutter

07:01.455 --> 07:03.822
(sighs)

07:03.824 --> 07:06.858
Oh, morning.

07:06.860 --> 07:08.693
Got your coffee.
You're late.
Where have you been?

07:08.695 --> 07:09.895
Getting your coffee.
Then there was traffic.

07:09.897 --> 07:11.062
There's an app for that.
Oh, is there an app

07:11.064 --> 07:12.631
To help you get along
with your coworker?

07:12.633 --> 07:14.699
There should be.
(harrison)
tell the congresswoman

07:14.701 --> 07:17.736
No, I don't know
when that'll be.
Where the hell is olivia?

07:17.738 --> 07:19.070
No idea.
Liar.

07:19.072 --> 07:20.639
I'm here.
What's the word?

07:20.641 --> 07:22.707
Whose campaign are we running?
Josie marcus'.

07:22.709 --> 07:24.142
Seriously?
I thought you'd
be thrilled.

07:24.144 --> 07:26.745
(purse thuds)
I am. I mean, politically,
ideologically,

07:26.747 --> 07:28.747
Big "d" democratically--
believe me, I'm over the moon.

07:28.749 --> 07:30.816
But honestly,
I'm also surprised.

07:30.818 --> 07:32.751
We thought for sure you'd go
with the white house.
Sitting president.

07:32.753 --> 07:35.821
Also, there's the whole,
you know, relationship thing.

07:37.757 --> 07:39.991
This is a chance
to make history...

07:39.993 --> 07:41.059
To change the world.

07:41.061 --> 07:42.727
Josie marcus has the raw talent.

07:42.729 --> 07:45.497
With our help, she could be
the first female president

07:45.499 --> 07:47.666
Of the United States.
With our help, she could win.

07:47.668 --> 07:49.935
White hat, people.

07:49.937 --> 07:52.204
Call josie's campaign
headquarters.

07:52.206 --> 07:53.472
Tell them we'll be there
in an hour.

07:54.307 --> 07:56.775
(projector and camera shutter
clicking)

07:56.777 --> 07:58.510
Now this little number
right here

07:58.512 --> 08:00.979
Took first place
at the montana state fair.

08:00.981 --> 08:03.815
Yeah, come on, guys, we can hit
the gym together later.
(silverware clinking)

08:03.817 --> 08:05.584
(laughter)
mmm!

08:05.586 --> 08:07.185
(cheers and applause)
mmm.

08:07.187 --> 08:08.720
I told ya.
I only have two vices--

08:08.722 --> 08:11.656
<i>(static)</i>
<i>say you're elected</i>
<i>the first female president</i>

08:11.658 --> 08:12.924
<i>Of the United States.</i>

08:12.926 --> 08:15.961
(telephone ringing)
<i>what's the very first</i>
<i>thing you do?</i>

08:15.963 --> 08:17.596
<i>Change the sheets.</i>

08:17.598 --> 08:19.097
<i>(laughter)</i>
<i>okay, that's enough.</i>

08:19.099 --> 08:20.599
(turns off video)
all right,
hold on a second.

08:20.601 --> 08:22.100
Now, you put those clips
together like that--

08:22.102 --> 08:25.270
Like I'm some kind
of cartoon character.

08:25.272 --> 08:27.973
Which is exactly
what the other side will do.

08:27.975 --> 08:29.541
They'll use this against you.

08:29.543 --> 08:34.145
We're not just baking pies.
(josie) all right,
candi, let 'em talk.

08:34.147 --> 08:35.847
We didn't hire them
so they could pinch our cheeks

08:35.849 --> 08:37.215
And give us blue ribbons.

08:37.217 --> 08:39.117
We need to re-introduce you
to the american public

08:39.119 --> 08:40.585
Along with
your small-town values,

08:40.587 --> 08:41.786
Play up your military service.

08:41.788 --> 08:45.991
And to do that, we need
to raise some <i>serious</i> cash.
P.A.C. Money.

08:45.993 --> 08:47.592
We've already got over
$6 million and counting--

08:47.594 --> 08:49.694
$6 million might pay
for the gas,

08:49.696 --> 08:50.729
But it sure as hell
won't buy you the plane.

08:50.731 --> 08:56.034
But you're getting <i>pummeled</i>
<i>by reston's ads on the airwaves.</i>

08:56.036 --> 08:57.135
And your post-debate spike
in the polls--

08:57.137 --> 08:59.671
It's time to respond
with ads of your own--

08:59.673 --> 09:01.606
Big media buys.

09:01.608 --> 09:03.842
Reston's already locked up
the big donors.
Then we unlock them.

09:03.844 --> 09:05.710
(sighs)
those people out there

09:05.712 --> 09:07.546
Working their tails off,

09:07.548 --> 09:11.750
Who have pledged their support
one crumpled dollar at a time--

09:11.752 --> 09:12.984
They believe in me

09:12.986 --> 09:14.719
Because I'm not accountable
to big money.

09:14.721 --> 09:16.655
You want to be mayor
of red springs or ralph nader,

09:16.657 --> 09:19.124
Turn your back on p.A.C. Money
and large donations.

09:19.126 --> 09:21.126
You want to win iowa
or new hampshire

09:21.128 --> 09:22.661
And become
the party's nominee?

09:23.996 --> 09:26.331
All right,
line up the fat cats.

09:26.333 --> 09:27.866
Let's just get this
over with.

09:27.868 --> 09:30.569
(rick james'
"give it to me baby" playing)

09:30.571 --> 09:32.337
Congresswoman,
this is don watson.

09:32.339 --> 09:34.573
Don represents
the sugar industry.

09:34.575 --> 09:39.244
I mean, try making a lollipop
out of a sugar packet.

09:39.246 --> 09:42.981
♪ give it to me, baby
♪ give it to me, baby

09:42.983 --> 09:44.215
I may be from
a landlocked state,

09:44.217 --> 09:46.885
But I've always been
very pro-ocean farming.

09:46.887 --> 09:48.620
I mean, heck, strap me
in a wet suit

09:48.622 --> 09:50.989
And put me on a tractor
and I'm good to go.

09:50.991 --> 09:53.224
Well, I'm not sure increasing
ethanol production

09:53.226 --> 09:55.860
Will end warfare entirely,
but I do entirely support it.

09:55.862 --> 09:57.729
Love sugar.

09:57.731 --> 09:59.197
Still sprinkle it
on my cornflakes.

09:59.199 --> 10:01.232
Every morning.

10:01.234 --> 10:02.867
The drones have served us
so well on the battlefield,

10:02.869 --> 10:05.003
Why not allow police
to use them for surveillance?

10:05.005 --> 10:07.606
Wow, that's music
to my ears.

10:07.608 --> 10:09.040
Pleasure meeting you.
Pleasure's all mine.

10:09.042 --> 10:11.776
Thank you for coming in.

10:11.778 --> 10:13.878
Look forward to your support.
You'll be hearing from us.

A nobody from
a state of nobodies.

11:00.827 --> 11:04.729
Get their mitts on him,
land on a catchy slogan--

11:04.731 --> 11:08.933
"we polked you in '44.
We shall pierce you in '52.

11:08.935 --> 11:10.735
Meet the 14th president
of our great republic.

11:10.737 --> 11:13.672
That was not meant to be
a lesson. It was a warning.

11:13.674 --> 11:15.807
Olivia pope knows
about remington,

11:15.809 --> 11:18.009
And now she's working
for josephine marcus.

11:18.011 --> 11:20.111
If she thought she needed it,
she'd use it against us.

11:20.113 --> 11:21.746
She'd let marcus
use it against us.

11:21.748 --> 11:23.014
She <i>thinks</i> she knows.

11:23.016 --> 11:24.382
She thinks she knows
because of ballard,

11:24.384 --> 11:26.451
And he's yet to come across
anything concrete.

11:26.453 --> 11:28.219
And he won't. Time's up.

11:28.221 --> 11:30.755
Are you saying...

11:30.757 --> 11:33.758
You shut down marcus,
I'll take care of ballard.

11:46.839 --> 11:48.373
Kate.
Hi, jake.

11:48.375 --> 11:49.407
You changed your hair.

11:49.409 --> 11:50.942
It's... Longer.

11:50.944 --> 11:53.311
You like it?
I like it.

11:53.313 --> 11:56.081
Do you still have access

11:56.083 --> 11:58.149
To the sub-basement
archives at langley?

11:58.151 --> 12:00.885
Why is meeting for coffee
never just meeting for coffee?

12:00.887 --> 12:02.921
I mean, I was hoping
for something more, but...

12:02.923 --> 12:05.356
Yes, I still have
my clearance level.

12:05.358 --> 12:08.727

12:08.729 --> 12:09.794
(projector and camera shutter

12:09.796 --> 12:12.263
It's important.
It always is.

12:13.232 --> 12:15.900
You know I live
just a few blocks from here

12:15.902 --> 12:18.303
If you ever want
something more than coffee.

12:18.305 --> 12:20.905
I would love to,
but I can't.

12:20.907 --> 12:22.073
You found somebody.

12:22.075 --> 12:24.275
Good for you.
(chuckles) civilian?

12:25.811 --> 12:27.112
No way--civilian.

12:27.114 --> 12:28.446
(mug thuds)
um...

12:28.448 --> 12:29.848
Oh...

12:29.850 --> 12:31.950
I'll call you
if I find anything.

12:40.226 --> 12:42.360
You said they loved me,
so I bowled them over.

12:42.362 --> 12:43.294
And you did.
It's just--

12:43.296 --> 12:44.395
They don't think you can win.

12:44.397 --> 12:46.197
It's the chicken and the egg.

12:46.199 --> 12:48.366
Donors don't want to spend
until they think you'll win,

12:48.368 --> 12:50.268
And you can't tip the polls
without the money required

12:50.270 --> 12:52.237
For a big media push.

12:52.239 --> 12:54.906
They're falling in line
behind reston

12:54.908 --> 12:56.374
Because they know
he's experienced

12:56.376 --> 12:57.942
And tough enough to go
after grant in the general.

12:57.944 --> 12:59.344
He did it once.
He'll do it again.

12:59.346 --> 13:01.913
I'm not going negative, liv.
That's not who I am.

13:01.915 --> 13:03.982
Let's get an interview
on the books--

13:03.984 --> 13:06.484
An in-depth profile
in prime time, lots of eyeballs,

13:06.486 --> 13:07.552
With someone big,
someone experienced,

13:07.554 --> 13:08.820
A diane sawyer,

13:08.822 --> 13:11.122
We'll use it
to convince the donors

13:11.124 --> 13:12.524
You've got the heft
and the backbone

13:12.526 --> 13:13.892
To sit in the oval.

13:15.394 --> 13:17.328
(projector and camera shutter
clicking)

13:17.330 --> 13:19.164
Harrison wright.
What do you want?

13:19.166 --> 13:21.299
Well, since we worked
so well together

13:21.301 --> 13:24.202
Another chance
to serve your country.

13:24.204 --> 13:26.371
The white house would prefer
pope and associates

13:26.373 --> 13:28.306
Not to work on
the josie marcus campaign.

13:28.308 --> 13:30.308
Conflict of interest.
You understand.

13:30.310 --> 13:33.178
I can't get her to do something
she doesn't want to do.

13:33.180 --> 13:35.513
No one can.
Well, I'd like you to try.

13:35.515 --> 13:37.215
I mean,
you used to sell cars.

13:37.217 --> 13:39.350
Right? I bet
you're pretty convincing.

13:39.352 --> 13:41.085
But if not, I understand.

13:41.087 --> 13:42.987
And it's not the only reason
I'm calling.

13:42.989 --> 13:45.390
I had a state department
briefing the other day.

13:45.392 --> 13:49.460
It seems adnan salif
has a visa application in.

13:49.462 --> 13:52.897
It'll be denied, of course,
given salif's history

13:52.899 --> 13:55.266
And criminal tendencies.

13:55.268 --> 13:56.868
But I did want to give you
the heads-up,

13:56.870 --> 13:58.303
Just in case salif
knows someone

13:58.305 --> 14:01.139
With enough juice
to pull some strings.

14:01.141 --> 14:04.242
Anywho... Food for thought.

14:05.511 --> 14:07.879
You had a question
for me, sir?

14:07.881 --> 14:11.282
Not a question.
An assessment.

14:11.284 --> 14:13.084
You seem calm, cy.

14:13.086 --> 14:15.520
Do I?
Yes, you do.

14:15.522 --> 14:18.223
Olivia feels free to question
my military record

14:18.225 --> 14:20.258
And all but accuse me
of lying about it,

14:20.260 --> 14:22.293
And you don't seem
the least bit worried.

14:22.295 --> 14:24.362
Haven't brought it up once.

14:24.364 --> 14:26.130
It's... Being taken care of.

14:26.132 --> 14:27.565
How?

14:27.567 --> 14:30.401
Captain ballard has been
in service a long time.

14:30.403 --> 14:31.870
He knows the rules.

14:31.872 --> 14:33.638
He knows what happens
when you disobey them.

14:33.640 --> 14:37.275
There are times
to obey orders...

14:37.277 --> 14:39.077
And times to refuse them.

14:39.079 --> 14:41.346
These aren't our orders,
mr. President.

14:41.348 --> 14:43.414
It's an internal matter
outside our domain.

14:43.416 --> 14:47.352
And unless you want b613
crossing into our territory--

14:47.354 --> 14:49.320
Messing with
your national security team,

14:49.322 --> 14:53.024
I <i>strongly</i> suggest
you wash your hands of this.

14:56.362 --> 14:58.496
That'll be all, cyrus.

15:02.301 --> 15:04.202

16:24.550 --> 16:27.685
Olivia, are you there?

16:30.255 --> 16:32.390
(voice breaking) what was
the last thing you said to her?

16:32.392 --> 16:35.760
Have you been drinking?
Yes.

16:35.762 --> 16:38.529
What was the last thing
you said to her?

16:38.531 --> 16:41.165
I said...

16:42.501 --> 16:44.469
"I love you."

16:44.471 --> 16:49.307
She was leaving,
and I kissed her on the cheek.

16:49.309 --> 16:52.477
And I said, "I love you."

16:52.479 --> 16:54.445
(exhales sharply)

16:57.316 --> 16:58.349
And did you?

16:58.351 --> 16:59.517
What?

16:59.519 --> 17:01.219
Love her?

17:01.221 --> 17:04.655
Olivia, why are you calling?

17:07.159 --> 17:10.395
I have so many questions
I want to ask you,

17:10.397 --> 17:12.430
But I'm afraid you'll kill
my friends if I do.

17:12.432 --> 17:15.299
So, you know...

17:17.803 --> 17:19.570
Let's just talk
about the weather

17:19.572 --> 17:23.408
Or, uh...

17:23.410 --> 17:24.675
How I can't form
attachments to people

17:24.677 --> 17:26.377
Because my mother is dead,

17:26.379 --> 17:29.414
And my father is that thing
that goes bump in the night.

17:29.416 --> 17:31.749
Or...

17:31.751 --> 17:33.418
You pick a topic.

17:33.420 --> 17:35.286
One question.

17:35.288 --> 17:39.290
(sighs) what?

17:39.292 --> 17:41.392
You can ask me one question.

17:41.394 --> 17:45.363
And you won't kill jake,

17:45.365 --> 17:46.297
Or huck...

17:46.299 --> 17:49.367
I won't.
Or anyone I love?

17:49.369 --> 17:53.304
I will answer <i>one</i> question.

17:54.473 --> 17:57.575
(sighs)

18:03.248 --> 18:05.750
Did you give the order
to have my mother killed?

18:05.752 --> 18:07.685
No.

18:07.687 --> 18:09.420
Did fitz shoot down
the plane that killed my--

18:09.422 --> 18:11.355
<i>One...</i> Question.

18:11.357 --> 18:12.757
(slaps table)
what did you do?!

18:12.759 --> 18:14.258
What happened?!

18:14.260 --> 18:15.126
Olivia...

18:18.297 --> 18:19.797
One thing I've learned
in life, olivia,

18:19.799 --> 18:24.335
Is that the past
is the past.

18:24.337 --> 18:26.737
It's best if you leave it...

18:26.739 --> 18:28.473
There.

18:30.175 --> 18:32.210
(line disconnects)

18:44.690 --> 18:47.391
You all set for your interview
with josephine marcus?

18:47.393 --> 18:49.794
That's tomorrow, right?
That's right.

18:49.796 --> 18:52.430
Hey, have you seen
my checkered thom browne tie?

18:52.432 --> 18:55.299
Oh, thank god.
If you're gonna borrow it--

18:55.301 --> 18:57.902
I know... Put it back
where I found it.

18:57.904 --> 18:59.770
So...

18:59.772 --> 19:01.405
You know what
you're gonna ask her?
Who?

19:01.407 --> 19:02.807
Marcus.
Oh, for the love of--

19:02.809 --> 19:04.275
James, you gotta be
prepared.

19:04.277 --> 19:05.743
We're not discussing this.

19:08.680 --> 19:10.548
Just tell me you'll ask
about that bastard baby--

19:10.550 --> 19:11.916
(scoffs) cyrus!

19:11.918 --> 19:14.318
What?
It's a fair question.

19:14.320 --> 19:15.887
A lot of people
care about adoption.

19:15.889 --> 19:16.888
We care about adoption.

19:16.890 --> 19:18.823
We are not discussing this.

19:18.825 --> 19:21.392
James, I'm trying
to help you here.

19:21.394 --> 19:23.461
And it's not gonna work,
not this time.

19:23.463 --> 19:27.331
Sit with the woman,
toss a few softballs her way,

19:27.333 --> 19:30.401
Become the new poster child
for liberal media bias.

19:30.403 --> 19:31.536
You must think I'm a moron.

19:31.538 --> 19:36.908
Maybe I'll start
with her favorite color.

19:36.910 --> 19:38.776
Oh, or what she listens to
when she works out.

19:38.778 --> 19:40.611
Whether she likes
her eggs scrambled

19:40.613 --> 19:43.281
Or over-easy--
whether she never remarried
because she's a lesbian.

19:43.283 --> 19:45.550
(scoffs)
I'm just saying...

19:45.552 --> 19:47.285
The woman's almost 50
and still single.

19:47.287 --> 19:48.319
We both know
what that means.

19:48.321 --> 19:49.887
Adoption
and sexual orientation--

19:49.889 --> 19:51.622
Those are
your talking points...

19:51.624 --> 19:52.957
For me?
Well...

19:52.959 --> 19:54.659
You're a shameless monster...

19:54.661 --> 19:56.194
Who loves you dearly!

20:04.903 --> 20:07.838
(turns tv sound on)
<i>(man) president grant</i>
<i>needs to ask himself,</i>

20:07.840 --> 20:11.676
<i>To the good, churchgoing folks</i>
<i>of this country?</i>

20:11.678 --> 20:13.978
<i>'cause we thought we elected</i>
<i>a christian, frank.</i>

20:13.980 --> 20:16.380
<i>And all the president's done</i>
<i>is managed to make</i>

20:16.382 --> 20:17.882
<i>A mockery of his marriage vows</i>

20:17.884 --> 20:20.384
<i>And turn his faith, his god,</i>

20:20.386 --> 20:22.286
<i>Which is why I'm organizing</i>
<i>this rally.</i>

20:22.288 --> 20:23.788
(cyrus) I assume you've seen
the news this morning.

20:23.790 --> 20:25.423
Your people are restless.

20:25.425 --> 20:26.524
Frankly, I don't know why

20:26.526 --> 20:27.692
They're going after
fitz right now

20:27.694 --> 20:29.727
When there's that former
teenage whore

20:29.729 --> 20:31.629
Gaining traction
with the democrats.

20:31.631 --> 20:33.497
She's a flash in the pan.
They know that.

20:33.499 --> 20:34.765
What can I do
to help, cyrus?

20:34.767 --> 20:36.000
Are you free
for dinner tonight?

20:36.002 --> 20:37.935
Not with me. I wouldn't
punish you that way.

20:37.937 --> 20:40.638
But with the president
and the first lady.

20:40.640 --> 20:42.873
He wants to talk
re-election strategy.

20:42.875 --> 20:44.308
I'll let him explain.

20:44.310 --> 20:45.576
I'll cancel my supper plans.

20:45.578 --> 20:47.278
You know I'm nothing
if not a team player.

20:47.280 --> 20:49.914
I do appreciate it.

20:49.916 --> 20:53.317
Hook, line, and sinker.

20:53.319 --> 20:55.419
Tell me we don't
make a great team.

21:00.859 --> 21:02.627
(projector and camera shutter
clicking)

21:02.629 --> 21:06.264
We could really use your help
on josie marcus.
I can't.

21:06.266 --> 21:07.832
Not today. I'm working
on something secret...

21:07.834 --> 21:09.433
For liv.
Fine.

21:09.435 --> 21:10.968
Do what you have to do.
But we need you.

21:10.970 --> 21:12.770
So hurry up
and get back in the game.

21:12.772 --> 21:15.473
(door closes)

21:15.475 --> 21:16.807
(sighs)

21:16.809 --> 21:18.609
Governor reston
was recently quoted as saying

21:18.611 --> 21:19.977
That electing you
to president right now

21:19.979 --> 21:21.979
Would be tantamount
to "letting a teenager

21:21.981 --> 21:23.381
"with a driver's permit
drive a tank

21:23.383 --> 21:24.548
Through a minefield in iraq."

21:24.550 --> 21:25.716
What do you have to say
in response?

21:25.718 --> 21:27.918
As someone who served
in the gulf war,

21:27.920 --> 21:30.021
I have the military
and diplomatic experience

21:30.023 --> 21:32.623
To deal with
any international situation

21:32.625 --> 21:34.959
That might arise
during my presidency.

21:34.961 --> 21:36.594
Also, I grew up
driving a tractor,

21:36.596 --> 21:38.629
So I figure a tank
can't be that much harder.

21:38.631 --> 21:40.965
Funny. But don't be funny
when talking foreign policy.

21:40.967 --> 21:42.900
Also, this is when
you hit back against

21:42.902 --> 21:45.436
Reston's lack
of military experience.

21:45.438 --> 21:46.937
I've tried that strategy
in past debates.

21:46.939 --> 21:48.873
And that whole pivot
and attack model--

21:48.875 --> 21:53.711
It's not who I am,
so next question.

21:53.713 --> 21:56.514
Congresswoman,
there was recently an article

21:56.516 --> 22:00.518
In a well-known men's magazine
dedicated entirely to your legs.

22:00.520 --> 22:02.086
Oh, no!
Tell james novak

22:02.088 --> 22:04.588
Any questions about my legs
or my workout regimen

22:04.590 --> 22:07.391
This is a question
you're going to get

22:07.393 --> 22:08.893
Again and again
during the campaign.

22:08.895 --> 22:10.328
<i>Now</i> be funny.

22:10.330 --> 22:13.664
I'll just say, "no comment."
next question.

22:13.666 --> 22:15.833
I get it. You don't want
to sling mud or pander

22:15.835 --> 22:17.868
To the sexism that will
inevitably pop up

22:17.870 --> 22:18.903
During this campaign.

22:18.905 --> 22:20.371
But ignoring the attacks
on you--

22:20.373 --> 22:21.839
Being likable all the time--

22:21.841 --> 22:23.507
Does not get you elected
president.

22:23.509 --> 22:24.842
You need to show your claws
at some point.

22:24.844 --> 22:26.610
Show you have claws.

22:26.612 --> 22:28.846
You're too... Nice.

22:28.848 --> 22:33.951
Unless you want to be
president of candy land.

22:33.953 --> 22:35.052
Listen, I know who I am,

22:35.054 --> 22:36.654
And I know what works
with voters.

22:36.656 --> 22:39.924
Hey! I'm the one running
for president here, okay,

22:39.926 --> 22:44.095
So stop trying to <i>make</i> me
into someone I'm not!

22:48.967 --> 22:51.001
I'm sorry.

22:51.003 --> 22:53.037
I'm gonna take a break.

22:57.476 --> 22:58.909
So she's got a temper.

23:00.679 --> 23:03.748
(typing)

23:04.783 --> 23:05.883
Huck.

23:05.885 --> 23:07.051
What?

23:07.053 --> 23:10.054
You and me--we're on
the same team, right?

23:10.056 --> 23:12.056
I mean, I know I get on you
about the super-spy stuff,

23:12.058 --> 23:14.091
But we're on
the same... Team?

23:14.093 --> 23:15.893
Yeah.

23:15.895 --> 23:17.128
And I don't ask you
for favors--

23:17.130 --> 23:18.562
Hacking me out
of speeding tickets--

23:18.564 --> 23:19.630
Anything like that.
No.

23:22.434 --> 23:24.468
Well, now I need one--

23:24.470 --> 23:25.636
A favor.

23:26.705 --> 23:28.939
Adnan salif is trying
to get back into the country,

23:28.941 --> 23:31.008
And that cannot happen.

23:31.010 --> 23:33.043
Can you make it impossible
for that to happen?

23:33.045 --> 23:37.915
I can erase salif's visa
application from the system.

23:37.917 --> 23:39.517
And that'll make it
impossible to issue

23:39.519 --> 23:40.951
An inadmissibility waiver.

23:40.953 --> 23:43.421
Good.

23:43.423 --> 23:47.625
'cause if adnan salif
sets foot on u.S. Soil...

23:47.627 --> 23:48.826
I'm a dead man.

23:50.595 --> 23:52.563
(projector and camera shutter
clicking)

23:52.565 --> 23:53.798
It's demoralizing--

23:53.800 --> 23:55.099
Coming at those two
hat in hand,

23:55.101 --> 23:57.001
Begging for help.
We need the base.

23:57.003 --> 23:58.869
Sally and daniel douglas
are the base,

23:58.871 --> 24:00.871
No matter how much it pains you
to spend time with them.

24:00.873 --> 24:03.941
You hate those holy hillbillies
as much as I do.

24:03.943 --> 24:06.010
And the idea that we have
to sit across from them

24:06.012 --> 24:07.878
Pretending to be <i>happy</i>
<i>and</i>    <i>normal</i>

24:07.880 --> 24:10.815
Like a pair of
fundamentalist lovebirds.

24:10.817 --> 24:13.050
They've got problems
of their own.

24:13.052 --> 24:14.185
What kind of problems?

24:14.187 --> 24:16.987
He's got a wandering eye,
evidently.

24:16.989 --> 24:19.690
(chuckles)
so ms. Bible bully and I

24:19.692 --> 24:22.927
Do have something in common
after all. How lovely.

24:22.929 --> 24:24.962
Sally, I just wanted
to break some bread

24:24.964 --> 24:26.864
And thank you for all your hard
work these last four years.

24:26.866 --> 24:28.466
Mr. President,
it's an honor and a pleasure.

24:28.468 --> 24:30.968
I know you've sometimes
felt shut out.

24:30.970 --> 24:31.969
Sometimes?

24:31.971 --> 24:33.571
I want to apologize
for that,

24:33.573 --> 24:35.005
And assure you that things
will be much more inclusive

24:35.007 --> 24:36.106
In a second
grant/langston term.

24:36.108 --> 24:38.843
And I want to make sure
they're heard.

24:38.845 --> 24:40.244
There's a spinach salad
from the white house garden,

24:40.246 --> 24:42.813
And we had the chef
find a recipe

24:42.815 --> 24:44.949
For south georgia biscuits,

24:44.951 --> 24:46.851
Just to give you two
a taste of home.
Oh...

24:46.853 --> 24:48.919
That is awfully kind of you.
(chuckles)

24:50.222 --> 24:53.257
Tell me, by inclusive,
do you mean

24:53.259 --> 24:55.226
Amenable to reverend coles?

24:55.228 --> 24:56.861
I would never ask you to--

24:56.863 --> 24:58.529
Oh, don't be silly.
I'm a team player.

24:58.531 --> 25:01.098
And I'm sure if I were
to explain to the reverend

25:01.100 --> 25:03.100
What good
and god-fearing people

25:03.102 --> 25:05.536
You and the first lady
really are--

25:05.538 --> 25:08.072
After all, it's in
the man's faith to forgive.

25:08.074 --> 25:10.074
Well, thank you, sally.
I'd appreciate that.

25:10.076 --> 25:12.009
(mellie giggles)
I've only told you
about a hundred times,

25:12.011 --> 25:14.011
Mel, those tar heels of yours
are never gonna make it

25:14.013 --> 25:16.747
To the sugar bowl
until their boosters step up--

25:16.749 --> 25:18.649
Oh, stop. (chuckles)

25:18.651 --> 25:19.783
Shall we eat?

25:19.785 --> 25:21.151
That sounds lovely.

25:21.153 --> 25:23.754
Does anybody mind if I say
a few words first?

25:23.756 --> 25:25.656
Daniel douglas,
I don't think I've heard grace

25:25.658 --> 25:26.924
Come out of your mouth in years.

25:26.926 --> 25:28.692
Sally does the honors
at our home.

25:28.694 --> 25:29.793
Would it be all right,
mr. President?

25:29.795 --> 25:31.629
Please. Go ahead.

25:36.902 --> 25:39.069
Let us pray.

25:39.071 --> 25:41.171
Heavenly father, we ask
that you bless this food

25:41.173 --> 25:42.873
To our use and us
to thy service.

25:42.875 --> 25:46.577
And keep us ever mindful
of the needs of others.

25:47.946 --> 25:49.213
Amen.

25:49.215 --> 25:52.216
(fitz) amen.
Amen.

26:00.892 --> 26:02.259
(gun thuds)

26:02.261 --> 26:04.929
(whirring, gunshots)

26:07.299 --> 26:09.967
(punches wall)

26:09.969 --> 26:13.003
Hey, robin,
where's batman?

26:15.740 --> 26:16.807
He's not here.

26:16.809 --> 26:18.742
Oh, bummer.

26:18.744 --> 26:20.010
You know what
your problem is?

26:21.146 --> 26:24.148
Your shoulders--they're all
high and tense.

26:24.150 --> 26:25.916
You're probably scared
of the kickback--

26:25.918 --> 26:27.318
(gunshots continue)
you know,
the backward momentum--

26:27.320 --> 26:28.786
Yeah, I know
what kickback means.

26:29.955 --> 26:30.988
What are you doing here?

26:30.990 --> 26:31.989
Relax.

26:31.991 --> 26:35.826
(chuckles) well...
I don't need your help.

26:35.828 --> 26:37.962
Oh, I think you do.

26:37.964 --> 26:39.597
I've seen your targets.

26:41.032 --> 26:42.032
Deep breath--

26:42.034 --> 26:44.935
In, then out--

26:44.937 --> 26:46.971
Real slow.

26:46.973 --> 26:48.205
Then bang.

26:52.844 --> 26:55.946
(gunshots continue)

26:55.948 --> 26:57.014
(picks up gun)

26:57.016 --> 26:58.916
(clatters and clicks)

26:58.918 --> 27:01.385
(inhales deeply)

27:01.387 --> 27:04.655
(exhaling deeply)

27:17.802 --> 27:20.671
(projector and camera shutter
clicking)

27:26.678 --> 27:29.680
Now is not a good time.

27:29.682 --> 27:31.715
It's about b613.

27:33.218 --> 27:34.918
Look, I know
you don't give a damn

27:34.920 --> 27:37.187
About my questions.

27:37.189 --> 27:40.224
But I need your professional
opinion here, huck.

27:40.226 --> 27:43.394
In b613, is anyone able
to get out

27:43.396 --> 27:45.663
And actually be normal?

27:45.665 --> 27:48.966
Jake seems sort of normal,
but I don't really know him.

27:48.968 --> 27:51.235
Or are you just completely
messed up

27:51.237 --> 27:52.403
For the rest of your life?

27:52.405 --> 27:55.906
No offense.

27:58.810 --> 28:00.744
Now's not a good time.

28:08.687 --> 28:11.088
Welcome, pastor.
Thank you for coming.

28:11.090 --> 28:13.457
Nice woodshed--fancy.

28:13.459 --> 28:15.259
Pardon?
Let's not kid around.

28:15.261 --> 28:16.727
That's what I am, right?
The president's woodshed

28:16.729 --> 28:17.928
About to get the paddle

28:17.930 --> 28:19.897
For speaking out against
his sins?

28:19.899 --> 28:21.365
Well, on the contrary.
I rather enjoyed your op-ed

28:21.367 --> 28:24.101
About the destructive effect
of the president's behavior

28:24.103 --> 28:26.737
On our nation's moral authority
around the globe.

28:26.739 --> 28:28.806
You did?
I found it
a little over-the-top.

28:28.808 --> 28:30.074
But I'm a man with little
to no principles,

28:30.076 --> 28:32.309
And you're a man
with many ironclad ones.

28:32.311 --> 28:33.777
And I don't intend to bend them,

28:33.779 --> 28:35.345
Not even for my dear friend
sally here.

28:35.347 --> 28:36.780
Nor would I ever ask you to.

28:36.782 --> 28:40.050
So if this isn't
the woodshed--

28:40.052 --> 28:43.887
To offer you the opportunity
to support a president

28:43.889 --> 28:47.891
Who shares your strong
principles and faith.
Oh?

28:47.893 --> 28:49.293
Mm.
And who might that be?

28:49.295 --> 28:51.328
Your dear friend sally here.

28:51.330 --> 28:56.467
Remember to smile.
If he asks about the economy--

28:56.469 --> 28:59.503
Who got drunk
eating fermented apples.

28:59.505 --> 29:00.370
I got it.
Five minutes, congresswoman.

29:00.372 --> 29:02.406
Thank you.

29:02.408 --> 29:04.374
(phones ringing)

29:04.376 --> 29:06.410
What's going on over here?
(clears throat)

29:06.412 --> 29:09.146
Nothing.
How are you feeling?

29:09.148 --> 29:11.348
Like my campaign manager
is hiding something from me.

29:11.350 --> 29:13.484
Congresswoman...

29:13.486 --> 29:15.385
Your head's in the game.
I don't want to take it out.

29:15.387 --> 29:16.954
Whatever it is,
I can handle it.

29:19.524 --> 29:22.126
A woman in the reston camp
leaked it to us.

29:22.128 --> 29:26.430
<i>Sit the leaders of syria,</i>
<i>china, and iran.</i>

29:26.432 --> 29:27.831
<i>(footsteps approaching)</i>
<i>on the other side of this door</i>

29:27.833 --> 29:29.233
<i>Is america's future,</i>

29:29.235 --> 29:30.534
<i>Success and failure,</i>

29:30.536 --> 29:32.236
<i>Life and death.</i>

29:32.238 --> 29:35.339
<i>Does america really want</i>
<i>an inexperienced hand</i>

29:35.341 --> 29:37.407
<i>Opening this door?</i>
<i>(footsteps retreating)</i>

29:40.245 --> 29:43.380
(key clicks)
listen...
I know it's insulting.

29:43.382 --> 29:45.816
I know it's sexist
and way below the belt.

29:45.818 --> 29:47.985
And we'll deal with this
later, but right now

29:47.987 --> 29:49.253
You have to focus
on this interview.

29:49.255 --> 29:51.355
So... Take a minute--

29:51.357 --> 29:53.056
Whatever you need--
I'm fine.

29:53.058 --> 29:54.892
Josie.
I'm fine.

29:54.894 --> 29:56.493
<i>(woman) josephine marcus--</i>

29:56.495 --> 29:58.362
<i>War widow,</i>
<i>first-term congresswoman,</i>

29:58.364 --> 30:00.164
<i>Presidential hopeful.</i>

30:00.166 --> 30:01.965
<i>Tonight, on "top of the hour,"</i>

30:01.967 --> 30:04.234
<i>Congresswoman marcus</i>
<i>sits down with james novak</i>

30:04.236 --> 30:06.003
<i>For her first</i>
<i>prime time interview</i>

30:06.005 --> 30:07.437
<i>Since becoming</i>
<i>the breakout star</i>

30:07.439 --> 30:10.140
<i>Of this year's</i>
<i>democratic primaries.</i>

30:10.142 --> 30:12.476
<i>Is this a real-life</i>
<i>cinderella story...</i>

30:12.478 --> 30:16.013
<i>Squeaking by</i>
<i>on her down-home charm?</i>

30:16.015 --> 30:17.915
<i>You decide,</i>
<i>on "top of the hour."</i>

30:17.917 --> 30:19.516
Three... Two...

30:19.518 --> 30:22.085
Congresswoman marcus,
thanks for joining us.

30:22.087 --> 30:23.854
Or I should say,
thank you for inviting me

30:23.856 --> 30:25.989
Into your lovely home.
My pleasure.

30:25.991 --> 30:27.891
Let's get right to it.

30:27.893 --> 30:30.360
The reston campaign says
that you lack the experience

30:30.362 --> 30:32.129
To be president
of the United States.

30:32.131 --> 30:33.897
What--what's your response
to that?

30:36.301 --> 30:39.002
Congresswoman marcus?
Mm-hmm.

30:39.004 --> 30:41.905
Um, there's something
my grandmother used to do

30:41.907 --> 30:44.041
Whenever I'd start
dating someone.

30:44.043 --> 30:46.109
I would tell her his name,
and then she would say,

30:46.111 --> 30:48.378
"oh, what part of town
does he live in?"

30:48.380 --> 30:51.415
That was her way of asking
if my boyfriend was white.

30:51.417 --> 30:53.951
Oh, yeah, my grandmother
was an out-and-out racist.

30:53.953 --> 30:56.119
So I know what prejudice
looks like.

30:56.121 --> 30:59.256
It's not about experience,
james. It's about <i>gender.</i>

30:59.258 --> 31:02.226
Reston's saying I don't
have the balls to be president,

31:02.228 --> 31:04.428
And he means that literally.
It's offensive.

31:04.430 --> 31:06.396
It's offensive to me
and to all the women

31:06.398 --> 31:07.931
Whose votes he's asking for.

31:07.933 --> 31:09.399
Uh, I'm sorry, are you--
are you saying

31:09.401 --> 31:11.535
That governor reston
is sexist?

31:11.537 --> 31:13.537
Yes. Yes, I am.
What the hell is she doing?

31:13.539 --> 31:15.339
And it's not just
governor reston

31:15.341 --> 31:18.208
Speaking in code about gender,
it's everyone--

31:18.210 --> 31:20.210
Yourself included.
Excuse me?

31:20.212 --> 31:22.579
The only reason we're doing
this interview in my house

31:22.581 --> 31:24.414
Is because you requested it.

31:24.416 --> 31:27.084
This was your idea,
and yet here you are,

31:27.086 --> 31:29.553
Thanking me for inviting you
into my <i>lovely home.</i>

31:29.555 --> 31:31.221
That's what you say
to the neighbor lady

31:31.223 --> 31:33.023
Who baked you
chocolate chip cookies.

31:33.025 --> 31:35.125
This pitcher of iced tea
isn't even mine.

31:35.127 --> 31:37.227
It's what your producers
set here.

31:37.229 --> 31:39.529
Why? Same reason
you called me

31:39.531 --> 31:41.899
"a real life
cinderella story."

31:41.901 --> 31:44.067
It reminds people
that I am a woman

31:44.069 --> 31:45.335
Without using the word.

31:45.337 --> 31:47.571
For you it's an angle,
I get that.

31:47.573 --> 31:49.306
And I'm sure you think
it's innocuous.

31:49.308 --> 31:52.109
But guess what? It's not.
You're pr--
congresswoman marcus--

31:52.111 --> 31:53.343
Don't interrupt me
when I'm speaking.

31:53.345 --> 31:54.478
I have to stop this.
Don't you dare.

31:54.480 --> 31:56.280
You're promoting
stereotypes, james.

31:56.282 --> 31:59.182
You're advancing this idea

31:59.184 --> 32:00.617
That women are weaker
than men.

32:00.619 --> 32:02.552
You're playing right
into the hands of reston

32:02.554 --> 32:04.688
And into the hands
of every other imbecile

32:04.690 --> 32:07.958
Who thinks a woman isn't fit
to be commander in chief.

32:07.960 --> 32:10.294
<i>Yes, governor,</i>
<i>I'm talking about you.</i>

32:10.296 --> 32:13.430
<i>Seven years I served</i>
<i>in the United States army,</i>

32:13.432 --> 32:16.566
<i>Which is seven more years than</i>
<i>governor reston ever served--</i>

32:16.568 --> 32:19.036
<i>A fact you conveniently</i>
<i>omitted from my intro.</i>

32:19.038 --> 32:22.239
<i>How about soldier?</i>
<i>Lieutenant?</i>

32:22.241 --> 32:23.540
<i>Yeah, I--</i>
<i>that was an oversight.</i>

32:23.542 --> 32:26.343
I-I am sorry.
Unbelievable!

32:26.345 --> 32:27.344
(cell phone rings)
<i>let's...</i>

32:27.346 --> 32:28.412
(turns tv off,
slams remote down)

32:30.515 --> 32:32.382
So what did she offer you?

32:32.384 --> 32:34.451
Let me guess--gay marriage
back off the table.

32:34.453 --> 32:36.620
No abortions for anyone ever.

32:36.622 --> 32:38.588
Yes, and yes,
on a silver platter,

32:38.590 --> 32:40.290
In exchange
for our endorsement.

32:40.292 --> 32:41.325
You were right.

32:41.327 --> 32:44.061
Well, reverend,
I like being married,

32:44.063 --> 32:46.096
And I believe in
a woman's right to choose.

32:46.098 --> 32:48.465
But how about you get to keep
all that righteous indignation

32:48.467 --> 32:50.734
That fills your collection plate
every Sunday,

32:50.736 --> 32:52.669
And president grant and I

32:52.671 --> 32:54.471
Go pray on some new
tax breaks?

32:54.473 --> 32:56.673
The lord speaks through you,
brother beene.

32:56.675 --> 33:00.010
(chuckles) yeah.
I get that a lot.

33:00.012 --> 33:01.511
(cell phone button clicks)

33:01.513 --> 33:02.746
The <i>balls</i> on that woman...

33:02.748 --> 33:06.249
What kills me is she's right.
We can't win without her.

33:06.251 --> 33:08.518
Sally has a weakness.

33:08.520 --> 33:11.254
Eh, what is it?
Garlic? Silver bullets?

33:11.256 --> 33:12.489
Her husband...

33:12.491 --> 33:14.291
More to the point--
her jealousy.

33:14.293 --> 33:16.760
Sally's not practical
like me.

33:16.762 --> 33:19.396
Daniel douglas langston
has a wandering eye.

33:19.398 --> 33:21.431
The man's
a little hands-y.

33:21.433 --> 33:23.300
We should use that.

33:25.236 --> 33:27.537
(exhaling sharply)

33:27.539 --> 33:30.440
(cell phone rings)

33:30.442 --> 33:33.510
(ring)

33:35.513 --> 33:39.249
You got it?
When have I ever
let you down?

34:09.680 --> 34:11.481
I owe you one.
Better make it two.

34:11.483 --> 34:13.617
Someone deleted
the catalog entry.

34:13.619 --> 34:15.485
I had to go box by box.

34:21.626 --> 34:23.660
(silenced bullet whizzes,
body thuds)

34:25.530 --> 34:27.798
Check her bag.

34:32.470 --> 34:34.304
(projector and camera shutter
clicking)

34:35.239 --> 34:36.473
You're welcome.

34:36.475 --> 34:37.574
(projector and camera shutter
clicking)

34:47.285 --> 34:49.219
That's right, don.

34:49.221 --> 34:52.656
There's gonna be a big ol' bowl
of lollipops on the desk.

34:52.658 --> 34:54.291
Uh-huh. Thanks again.

34:54.293 --> 34:56.259
Full commitment.

34:56.261 --> 34:59.463
(cheering)

34:59.465 --> 35:02.599
Strauss and vasington
are in, too.

35:02.601 --> 35:04.868
We'll have enough for the first
wave of ad buys in iowa.

35:04.870 --> 35:06.803
Good work, everyone.

35:06.805 --> 35:09.172
Thank you.
(cheering)

35:09.174 --> 35:10.507
(chuckles)

35:10.509 --> 35:12.242
I know you're not a hugger,
but screw it.

35:12.244 --> 35:13.577
Oh!
(chuckles and moans)

35:13.579 --> 35:16.113
My husband always said
my big mouth

35:16.115 --> 35:17.614
Was gonna get me
in trouble someday.

35:17.616 --> 35:18.782
Or make you president.
Mm.

35:18.784 --> 35:20.250
Mm.

35:23.221 --> 35:25.255
Congratulations.
You, too.

35:25.257 --> 35:27.691
So you all--you're really
full-service, aren't you?

35:27.693 --> 35:29.426
You raise money,
organize the ground game,

35:29.428 --> 35:31.361
Bury secrets,
and still have time

35:31.363 --> 35:33.130
To go out and make
fake political ads.

35:33.865 --> 35:36.166
You're wearing the same
nail polish as the shaky hand.

35:36.168 --> 35:40.203
She needed to get angry.
We needed to get her there.

35:40.205 --> 35:41.505
Is there a line
you won't cross?

35:41.507 --> 35:44.174
We'll let you know
when we find it.

35:44.176 --> 35:47.344
(projector and camera shutter
clicking)

35:47.346 --> 35:51.448
Mr. Wright.
Ah, that's funny.

35:51.450 --> 35:54.217
(chuckles) here,
come in. Come in.

35:54.219 --> 35:57.187
Sit.

35:57.189 --> 35:58.221
(clears throat)

35:58.223 --> 35:59.389
Mr. Beene--
cyrus.

35:59.391 --> 36:00.790
Cyrus...

36:00.792 --> 36:03.226
Do you understand
how long it's been

36:03.228 --> 36:05.395
Since liv's been
inspired by someone--

36:05.397 --> 36:06.596
Not just fighting
the good fight,

36:06.598 --> 36:08.698
Not just being <i>the best</i>
<i>at what we do--</i>

36:08.700 --> 36:09.799
But inspired?

36:09.801 --> 36:11.434
Liv wants to work
for josie marcus.

36:11.436 --> 36:13.703
I will work for liv,
<i>not</i> for you.

36:13.705 --> 36:15.872
You understand I don't
make empty threats?

36:15.874 --> 36:20.544
Tell the state on record
that I, cyrus beene,

36:20.546 --> 36:23.246
Want to bring this criminal
back into the country.

36:23.248 --> 36:24.915
I don't think you wanna
do that.

36:28.252 --> 36:29.686
Good luck
with your candidate.

36:29.688 --> 36:30.921
Good luck with yours.

36:35.726 --> 36:39.229
(door closes)

36:39.231 --> 36:41.598
(clears throat)

36:41.600 --> 36:43.600
(cell phone clicks)

36:43.602 --> 36:45.602
Corey, cyrus beene.

36:45.604 --> 36:47.304
I need you to issue a visa--

36:47.306 --> 36:50.574
Not an inadmissibility waiver,
a whole new visa--

36:50.576 --> 36:52.375
For adnan salif.

36:56.747 --> 36:58.248
Hey.
(clatters)

36:58.250 --> 36:59.249
What up, robin?

36:59.251 --> 37:00.784
I don't know. I'm--

37:00.786 --> 37:03.453
I'm... Still struggling
with the recoil.

37:03.455 --> 37:04.721
So...
(gunshot)

37:04.723 --> 37:06.556
So... Let me give you
a few pointers.

37:06.558 --> 37:08.558
Don't be shy.
Step right up.

37:08.560 --> 37:10.660
(gunshots continue)

37:10.662 --> 37:12.562
Here we go.

37:12.564 --> 37:14.231
(gun clatters, thuds)

37:14.233 --> 37:16.333
(cocks gun)

37:19.270 --> 37:22.405
(projector and camera shutter
clicking)

37:22.407 --> 37:24.641
(gunshots in distance)
seed is planted.

37:24.643 --> 37:26.943
I'm watering
and showing it love

37:26.945 --> 37:28.245
And waiting for it to bloom.

37:28.247 --> 37:30.480
(projector and camera shutter
clicking)

37:30.482 --> 37:33.583
Just make sure it does.

37:33.585 --> 37:35.652
Bloom--it's important.

37:35.654 --> 37:37.687
You got it, sir.
(gunshot)

37:44.262 --> 37:45.629
Thank you, mike.

37:45.631 --> 37:48.365
Mr. President.

37:48.367 --> 37:50.000
(door closes)

37:50.002 --> 37:51.568
When did you put
a security detail on me?

37:51.570 --> 37:54.337
When I found out
that b613 wanted you dead.

37:54.339 --> 37:57.374
Thank you.

37:57.376 --> 37:59.609
I appreciate the cover.

37:59.611 --> 38:00.777
I can't say
I wasn't surprised,

38:00.779 --> 38:04.014
Really? After all the missions
we served together?

38:04.016 --> 38:05.915
This isn't
about all the missions.

38:05.917 --> 38:07.284
This is about one.

38:08.653 --> 38:10.553
Where were you?

38:12.056 --> 38:13.523
What mission were you on
when I was on remington?

38:13.525 --> 38:15.992
Let it go, jake.
I'd love to, but I can't.

38:15.994 --> 38:17.794
What is your problem?!

38:17.796 --> 38:20.430
Since when do you have
a death wish?

38:20.432 --> 38:22.299
I am telling you...

38:22.301 --> 38:25.335
I am ordering you--
walk away!

38:25.337 --> 38:28.305
Whatever it was,

38:28.307 --> 38:30.674
Whatever you did
on that mission...

38:30.676 --> 38:35.578
Finding it out is the only way
I can ever be free from b613.

38:35.580 --> 38:38.481
It might be the only chance
I ever have

38:38.483 --> 38:40.083
Of sleeping
with both eyes closed again.

38:40.085 --> 38:41.885
Or is it the only chance
you may ever have

38:41.887 --> 38:43.086
Of sleeping with her?

38:47.692 --> 38:50.026
I can't help you anymore.

38:51.862 --> 38:53.530
You're on your own now.

39:00.738 --> 39:03.340
(knock on door)

39:03.342 --> 39:05.709
(clacks)
(sighs)

39:21.492 --> 39:23.126
Are you here to answer
my question...

39:23.128 --> 39:26.029
About what you were doing
during operation remington?

39:26.031 --> 39:28.098
You could come on
the campaign trail.

39:28.100 --> 39:30.033
We could...

39:30.035 --> 39:32.936
Try to be us again.

39:32.938 --> 39:34.804
Try to...

39:34.806 --> 39:37.941
I don't know. (chuckles)

39:37.943 --> 39:40.877
We could try.

39:42.813 --> 39:44.414
You shouldn't have
come here.

39:44.416 --> 39:46.049
There is nothing
you could do

39:46.051 --> 39:49.452
That I wouldn't forgive--
not a thing.

39:49.454 --> 39:52.455
We both know that.
We learned the hard way.

39:52.457 --> 39:54.491
Why won't you extend me
the same courtesy?

39:54.493 --> 39:55.992
(whispers) don't do this.

39:55.994 --> 39:58.962
Stop looking.
Stop digging.

39:58.964 --> 40:00.797
Leave it alone.
It's in the past.

40:00.799 --> 40:01.898
Just leave it alone.

40:01.900 --> 40:03.433
Not until you answer
the question.

40:03.435 --> 40:05.635
Why is this
so important to you?

40:11.108 --> 40:13.443
There was a global world
airlines plane

40:13.445 --> 40:15.879
That went down.

40:15.881 --> 40:18.014
329 people were killed.
Olivia--

40:18.016 --> 40:19.749
They said it was
a mechanical failure--

40:19.751 --> 40:22.652
Something they could never
quite figure out--

40:22.654 --> 40:25.054
How a plane could just
fall out of the sky.

40:25.056 --> 40:27.891
That doesn't happen.
That <i>never</i> happens.

40:27.893 --> 40:29.993
So they recalled the engine,

40:29.995 --> 40:31.594
But it turns out
they didn't need to

40:31.596 --> 40:34.597
Because it wasn't
the plane at all.

40:34.599 --> 40:36.900
Because what nobody knew--

40:36.902 --> 40:39.602
It didn't crash.

40:39.604 --> 40:43.173
It was shot down,
right out of the sky.

40:43.175 --> 40:47.977
Someone killed them--
all 329 of them.

40:47.979 --> 40:49.446
They fell into the ocean.

40:49.448 --> 40:51.815
(voice breaking)
and they died.

40:51.817 --> 40:54.484
So I want you
to answer the question.

40:54.486 --> 40:57.086
Where were you
during operation remington?

40:57.088 --> 41:00.690
Like I said, I don't know
what you're talking about.

41:00.692 --> 41:04.227
One of the bodies...

41:04.229 --> 41:06.830
(gulps) in the ocean

41:06.832 --> 41:08.498
Was my mother.

41:11.202 --> 41:14.971
Do you still not know
what I'm talking about?

41:20.744 --> 41:23.046
Fitz...

41:24.215 --> 41:27.851
I don't know
what you're talking about.

41:34.892 --> 41:38.161
I was 12...

41:38.163 --> 41:39.596
When she died.

41:41.499 --> 41:43.967
I was 12.

42:23.774 --> 42:27.710
(projector and camera shutter
clicks)
