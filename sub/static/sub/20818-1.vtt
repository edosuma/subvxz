00:58.901 --> 01:01.302
I'm not very interested in my school days

01:01.870 --> 01:05.364
and feel no special nostalgia for them.

01:05.441 --> 01:07.603
But I remember Sixth Form.

01:12.047 --> 01:14.174
Good morning.

01:14.249 --> 01:18.551
And welcome to you all
as we begin the new term.

01:19.788 --> 01:23.550
In those days, we imagined ourselves
as being in a holding pen,

01:23.625 --> 01:25.886
waiting to be released into our lives.

01:25.961 --> 01:27.987
From summer to autumn.

01:28.063 --> 01:30.590
So, too, do we think ahead...

01:30.665 --> 01:32.896
Rather him than us.

01:33.535 --> 01:37.068
And when that moment would come,
we would be at university.

01:43.145 --> 01:47.341
How were we to know that
our lives had already begun,

01:47.416 --> 01:51.444
and our release would only be
into a larger holding pen?

01:51.520 --> 01:54.684
And in time, a larger holding pen.

01:58.861 --> 02:01.121
When you are young, you want your emotions

02:01.196 --> 02:04.132
to be like the ones you read about in books.

02:05.801 --> 02:10.263
You want them to overturn your life
and create a new reality.

02:10.339 --> 02:13.298
But as that second hand
insists on speeding up

02:13.398 --> 02:18.439
and time delivers us all too quickly
into middle age, and then old age,

02:18.514 --> 02:22.076
that's when you want something
a little milder, don't you?

02:24.686 --> 02:28.614
You want your emotions to support
your life as it has become.

02:30.492 --> 02:34.224
You want them to tell you
that everything is going to be okay.

02:35.931 --> 02:37.957
And is there anything wrong with that?

02:55.817 --> 03:00.781
"Sir, according to your recent survey,
95% of British motorists

03:00.856 --> 03:03.917
describe themselves
as 'above average' drivers.

03:03.992 --> 03:08.422
But by the law of averages, we are,
most of us, bound to be average.

03:08.497 --> 03:09.656
Are we not?

03:09.731 --> 03:12.257
Anthony Webster, London."

03:25.947 --> 03:28.550
- Good timing.
- Sorry?

03:31.720 --> 03:35.748
Oh, uh, sign there, thanks.

03:35.824 --> 03:39.352
- Lovely morning, isn't it?
- Hmm.

03:40.078 --> 03:41.444
Thank you.

05:13.221 --> 05:15.781
- Can I help you?
- Just looking.

05:15.857 --> 05:19.089
- By all means.
- Oh! Wow.

05:20.329 --> 05:22.059
These are beautiful.

05:23.632 --> 05:25.157
How much is this one?

05:26.802 --> 05:28.996
Â£2,399.

05:29.071 --> 05:30.430
Â£2,000?

05:30.505 --> 05:31.798
Extremely rare model.

05:31.873 --> 05:34.900
- Still works, huh?
- Of course.

05:34.976 --> 05:36.670
How do you source them on the Internet?

05:36.745 --> 05:38.737
I've been in the Leica business
for some time,

05:38.814 --> 05:40.907
so we have our own exclusive sources.

05:40.982 --> 05:43.975
"We"? It's just you, isn't it?

05:44.052 --> 05:48.115
If there's anything you're particularly
interested in, I may be able to help you.

05:48.190 --> 05:49.988
Do you have anything cheaper?

05:51.426 --> 05:53.452
Some Leica Ills, 500.

05:53.528 --> 05:54.860
500?

05:55.430 --> 05:56.989
Wow.

05:57.065 --> 05:59.159
These are the finest cameras ever made.

05:59.234 --> 06:01.669
People buy them because they love them.

06:02.337 --> 06:06.041
Well, as they say,
I'd be rich if I didn't have kids.

06:07.576 --> 06:09.202
You got kids?

06:09.277 --> 06:12.179
- Excuse me?
- I've got two baby girls.

06:15.117 --> 06:18.045
- I have a daughter.
- Oh.

06:18.120 --> 06:21.352
Fathers and daughters, eh? Very special.

06:29.331 --> 06:30.892
Okay.

06:31.633 --> 06:35.593
Well, I'll look you up
when the kids have left home.

06:35.670 --> 06:37.130
Tony Webster.

06:37.205 --> 06:40.107
- Have a lovely day, Tony Webster.
- Okay.

06:55.657 --> 06:58.183
- Hello, Margaret.
- I'm calling to remind you that

06:58.260 --> 07:02.723
this evening you're duty bound to attend
the NCT with your beloved daughter.

07:02.798 --> 07:04.057
Tonight?

07:04.132 --> 07:06.526
Uh, oh, no, no, no, sorry. No can do.

07:06.601 --> 07:09.594
Oh, for God's sake.
This should be in your diary.

07:09.671 --> 07:10.695
Susie's relying on you.

07:10.772 --> 07:14.300
You know I can't do it
with this thing on my leg.

07:14.376 --> 07:16.103
I'm winding you up.

07:16.178 --> 07:18.505
Somebody's in a playful mood.

07:18.580 --> 07:19.806
Always.

07:19.881 --> 07:22.976
Well, don't forget to dig out
something loose-fitting.

07:23.051 --> 07:25.247
Lycra. All-in-one.

07:26.655 --> 07:28.548
Very attractive.

07:28.623 --> 07:30.251
What are you doing this evening?

07:31.293 --> 07:33.253
Working. What else?

07:33.328 --> 07:35.088
Really?

07:35.163 --> 07:37.723
So I'm expecting a full report
in the morning.

07:37.799 --> 07:40.564
- How's the foot, by the way?
- Bye, Tony.

07:42.035 --> 07:43.935
Hmm, charming.

08:24.279 --> 08:26.573
- Hi.
- It's me.

08:26.648 --> 08:27.741
You're not Mum.

08:27.816 --> 08:30.277
Indeed, I'm not. Your mother sent me.

08:30.352 --> 08:33.513
I'm your geriatric knight in shining armor.

08:33.587 --> 08:36.482
- Can you give me a minute?
- Can I come in?

08:38.792 --> 08:40.523
Thank you.

08:43.298 --> 08:45.824
The Prime Minister has insisted
Britain will be safer

08:45.901 --> 08:49.529
and economically stronger
if it remains in the European Union.

08:49.604 --> 08:53.600
He said a vote to leave would cause
such instability on the financial markets

08:53.675 --> 08:56.839
that the UK could be
tipped back into recession.

08:58.847 --> 09:02.642
- All right, Dad, let's do this.
- Have you seen this?

09:02.717 --> 09:04.310
I know, I know.

09:04.386 --> 09:05.911
It's the bollocking upstairs neighbor.

09:05.987 --> 09:08.081
- What happened?
- I don't know.

09:08.156 --> 09:09.449
Overflowing bath or something.

09:09.524 --> 09:12.452
- That's ridiculous.
- I know.

09:12.527 --> 09:14.154
Come on.

09:14.229 --> 09:15.925
I'll write to them.

09:16.765 --> 09:19.360
Dad, no one writes letters anymore.

09:26.207 --> 09:30.008
So, I should probably warn you,
tonight will likely feature lesbians.

09:31.246 --> 09:35.175
I've known quite a number of lesbians
in my time, thank you very much.

09:35.250 --> 09:37.543
Artificially inseminated lesbians.

09:37.618 --> 09:40.283
I once knew a pasteurized lesbian.

09:41.356 --> 09:45.719
Just try not to say anything
too mental, will you?

09:45.794 --> 09:50.257
The woman who runs the group takes
the whole thing pretty seriously.

09:50.332 --> 09:52.563
I'm sure she does.

09:55.804 --> 09:59.099
Hi, I'm Tony.
I'm this evening's stand-in mother.

09:59.174 --> 10:00.367
Standing in for the mother of the mother.

10:00.442 --> 10:03.770
You just rock with it.
And you will get a rhythm.

10:03.845 --> 10:06.740
But, uh, not to worry.
I have been effectively sterilized.

10:06.815 --> 10:08.675
But the voice of experience tonight.

10:08.750 --> 10:10.844
Now the contraction comes.

10:10.919 --> 10:12.945
So... sit up.

10:13.021 --> 10:14.580
Your contraction's coming.

10:14.656 --> 10:18.115
Hi, I'm Susie. Uh, this is my first.

10:18.193 --> 10:22.088
Um, I'm expecting a boy in October.

10:22.163 --> 10:25.691
You're in the arms of your protector

10:25.767 --> 10:27.994
and your baby, it is going to be fine.

10:28.069 --> 10:30.297
And I think I'm gonna name him Joshua.

10:30.372 --> 10:32.398
- Oh!
- Really?

10:32.474 --> 10:33.464
Yeah.

10:33.541 --> 10:37.503
We've got another surge that has started.

10:37.578 --> 10:38.772
So...

10:38.847 --> 10:41.339
You okay there, Dad?

10:41.416 --> 10:44.580
So maybe if you come further down.

10:46.421 --> 10:48.148
That's it.

10:48.223 --> 10:49.416
See, this is the other thing.

10:49.491 --> 10:54.287
Depends if your partner's agile or not agile,
you know, or to get into positions.

10:54.362 --> 10:56.990
It's taking them into consideration as well

10:57.065 --> 10:59.091
and make whatever's comfortable
for the both of you.

11:07.008 --> 11:08.702
- Me, as well.
- Yes.

11:08.777 --> 11:11.713
It was amazing. And so much fun.

11:24.626 --> 11:27.887
Wait here a sec. I wanna give you something.

11:27.962 --> 11:29.590
Oh, all right.

11:38.773 --> 11:40.934
There has, and continues to be criticism

11:41.009 --> 11:44.270
of the government's approach
to rebuilding Britain's economy.

11:44.345 --> 11:48.774
And we're better placed to withstand
an ideological drive to shrink the state,

11:48.850 --> 11:52.145
with some of the most vulnerable people
in society paying the price.

11:52.220 --> 11:54.246
A charge that the ministers
would of course, reject?

11:54.322 --> 11:57.017
Yeah, sure, they'd insist the tough measures

11:57.092 --> 12:00.153
they're taking will ensure Britain's
finances get back onto an even keel.

12:00.228 --> 12:03.089
And we're better placed to
withstand any economic shocks

12:03.164 --> 12:04.457
that may come our way in the future.

12:04.532 --> 12:07.764
Economic shocks such as, for instance...

12:13.141 --> 12:14.837
Whoops.

12:20.181 --> 12:21.941
- Here.
- What's this?

12:22.016 --> 12:24.411
Time to join the 21st century.

12:24.486 --> 12:27.479
Not least because I'm about to burst
and Mum's an invalid.

12:27.555 --> 12:29.820
You're my only hope.

12:30.391 --> 12:32.292
- Bye, Dad.
- Bye.

14:07.822 --> 14:09.149
Oh, good morning.

14:09.224 --> 14:11.050
Just about.

14:11.125 --> 14:14.754
Um... right. Let me get that...

14:14.829 --> 14:16.860
82...

14:18.199 --> 14:20.191
Uh, and then you need to...

14:20.268 --> 14:23.363
No. Oh, sorry. There.

14:25.540 --> 14:27.532
- Right.
- Thanks.

14:28.509 --> 14:30.637
All right. Have a nice...

14:48.296 --> 14:52.427
"Dear, Tony, I think it right
that you should have the attached.

14:53.534 --> 14:57.197
Adrian always spoke warmly of you,

14:57.272 --> 15:00.834
and perhaps you'll find it
an interesting, if painful,

15:00.909 --> 15:03.845
memento of long ago.

15:05.780 --> 15:07.941
I am also leaving you some money.

15:08.016 --> 15:09.709
You may find this a bit strange,

15:09.784 --> 15:14.080
and, to tell you the truth, I'm not
entirely sure what my own motives are,

15:14.155 --> 15:18.084
but I wish you well,
even from beyond the grave.

15:18.159 --> 15:20.386
Yours, Sarah Ford.

15:20.461 --> 15:22.521
P.S., it may sound a little odd,

15:22.597 --> 15:25.525
but I think the last months
of his life were happy."

15:25.600 --> 15:27.060
Mr. Webster?

15:27.135 --> 15:31.596
"Dear, Tony, I think it right
you should have the attached.

15:31.673 --> 15:33.466
Adrian always spoke warmly of you,

15:33.541 --> 15:35.702
and perhaps you will find it
an interesting, if painful,

15:35.777 --> 15:38.538
- memento of long ago."
- We do not currently...

15:38.613 --> 15:42.442
So it is this attached item referred to,
which is the missing item.

15:42.517 --> 15:45.885
We do not currently have
the second item in our possession.

15:46.654 --> 15:48.281
Excuse me?

15:48.356 --> 15:50.916
I said, we do not currently have
the second item in our possession.

15:51.659 --> 15:53.651
Well, where on earth is it?

15:53.728 --> 15:56.022
The item is currently
with Mrs. Ford's executor.

15:56.097 --> 15:57.190
Mrs. Ford's daughter.

15:57.265 --> 16:00.059
- Veronica?
- Mm.

16:00.134 --> 16:02.694
- You've asked for it, I assume?
- That's correct.

16:04.005 --> 16:06.199
Has she given any reason for withholding it?

16:06.274 --> 16:07.700
I'm afraid I don't know.

16:07.775 --> 16:10.403
Forgive me, but what do you know?

16:10.478 --> 16:12.438
What is it? Have you actually seen it?

16:12.513 --> 16:15.642
No, I haven't. Um...

16:15.717 --> 16:17.743
I can look it up for you, if you wish.

16:17.819 --> 16:19.720
Please do.

16:24.225 --> 16:28.094
So, Mrs. Ford's will
describes the second item...

16:30.365 --> 16:32.525
- as a diary.
- A diary?

16:32.600 --> 16:34.394
Belonging to Mrs. Ford?

16:34.469 --> 16:35.869
I'm afraid that's not clear.

16:37.872 --> 16:40.933
Can you let me have
Veronica's address, please?

16:41.009 --> 16:44.704
I'm sorry, we can't give out clients'
addresses without their permission.

16:44.779 --> 16:46.239
Veronica and I know one another.

16:46.314 --> 16:49.075
Well, did know one another,
albeit rather a long time ago.

16:49.150 --> 16:52.348
I'm afraid I would need
her authority to do that.

16:53.321 --> 16:56.916
Well, will you kindly request
that authority, please?

16:56.991 --> 16:58.084
Very well.

16:58.159 --> 17:01.220
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

17:01.295 --> 17:03.890
It was a pleasure meeting you, Mr. Webster.

17:03.965 --> 17:05.858
Good-bye.

17:05.933 --> 17:08.732
And you should know that my ex-wife is a QC.

17:16.377 --> 17:18.070
Yeah, this all seems fine.

17:18.146 --> 17:21.406
So, she has it, the diary.
That much at least we do know.

17:21.482 --> 17:23.576
Sorry, who has it?

17:23.651 --> 17:25.877
You know, those things
are really bad for you.

17:25.953 --> 17:28.381
They just build up excess mucus.

17:28.455 --> 17:33.052
I'm sorry, Dr. Webster, didn't think we
were here to discuss my breadstick intake.

17:33.127 --> 17:34.823
All right, sorry, sorry, sorry.

17:36.197 --> 17:37.859
Feel better once we've eaten.

17:39.133 --> 17:40.624
Once we've ordered. Ah.

17:40.701 --> 17:43.000
Thank God.

17:44.372 --> 17:47.967
- Sir, Madam?
- I'd like the carbonara, please.

17:48.042 --> 17:51.274
Mm, penne con salsa di pomodoro e basilico.

17:54.549 --> 17:55.539
Thank you.

18:05.259 --> 18:07.125
- What?
- Tell me, tell me.

18:18.840 --> 18:21.935
# I feel depressed, I feel so bad #

18:24.679 --> 18:27.774
# 'Cause you're the best girl
that I've ever had #

18:30.418 --> 18:34.082
# I can't get your love,
I can't get affection #

18:36.591 --> 18:39.857
# Oh, little girl, psychotic reaction #

18:40.761 --> 18:43.127
# And it feels like this... #

18:58.646 --> 19:00.444
Not enjoying the party?

19:02.683 --> 19:04.743
It's not really my cup of tea.

19:07.855 --> 19:09.619
I'm a manic depressive, you see.

19:11.826 --> 19:13.226
Not another one.

19:15.196 --> 19:18.598
Clifton Suspension Bridge. My mind's made up.

19:33.381 --> 19:34.974
Done.

19:35.049 --> 19:36.409
Mm.

19:36.484 --> 19:37.713
Well...

19:38.853 --> 19:39.980
it was nice to meet you.

19:47.562 --> 19:50.532
- Tony.
- Tony.

19:51.899 --> 19:55.836
# Oh, little girl, would you like
to take a ride now? #

19:57.805 --> 20:01.003
# I can't get your love,
I can't get satisfaction #

20:04.011 --> 20:06.947
# Oh, little girl, psychotic reaction #

20:25.800 --> 20:27.530
I wonder how far it is.

20:30.805 --> 20:33.934
It's 245 feet.

20:35.109 --> 20:37.203
So not very far, then.

20:40.147 --> 20:42.844
Why is your watch
on the inside of your wrist?

20:43.851 --> 20:46.013
Is it? I don't know.

20:58.566 --> 21:00.194
So what's your subject, then?

21:02.536 --> 21:06.465
- Le franÃ§ais.
- Oh. Oui.

21:06.540 --> 21:10.068
- Parlez-vous franÃ§ais?
- Oui.

21:27.595 --> 21:29.222
Magnifique.

21:29.297 --> 21:34.031
# There was a time
I thought of mine only... #

21:36.070 --> 21:37.333
Cheers.

21:38.806 --> 21:40.069
Cheers.

21:42.743 --> 21:45.705
# I was noble personage #

21:45.780 --> 21:49.683
# Born to beautify the page #

21:50.751 --> 21:56.190
# If I used time to set it down #

22:00.961 --> 22:03.422
# There was a time I thought of mine... #

22:03.497 --> 22:05.398
You still haven't told me your name.

22:10.071 --> 22:13.432
I tend to find it inadvisable
to give out my name

22:13.507 --> 22:15.942
to strange men I've only just met.

22:17.878 --> 22:19.839
Sounds like a fruitcake, this Sarah.

22:19.914 --> 22:21.712
Veronica. Her name's Veronica.

22:23.217 --> 22:26.412
What? I thought you said
the diary belonged to Sarah?

22:26.487 --> 22:30.182
Apparently, yes, the diary, yes,
left to me by Sarah Ford.

22:30.257 --> 22:32.817
- Who is?
- Veronica's mother.

22:33.928 --> 22:36.955
So, you... you slept with Veronica
or you slept with Sarah?

22:37.732 --> 22:40.827
Strictly speaking, neither. Sadly.

22:42.203 --> 22:44.365
Veronica and I were together.

22:45.706 --> 22:47.099
Boyfriend and girlfriend.

22:47.174 --> 22:49.439
Exactly, yes. Kind-kind of an item, yes.

22:50.678 --> 22:52.738
- But that...
- And that's how you know Sarah.

22:55.015 --> 22:57.143
- Yes.
- Right.

22:58.719 --> 22:59.982
So we're getting somewhere.

23:14.068 --> 23:15.900
Looks like he's planning to move in.

23:17.405 --> 23:18.634
You look nervous.

23:19.840 --> 23:21.206
Tony, this is my father.

23:22.176 --> 23:23.872
- Tony.
- David.

23:25.146 --> 23:27.573
We've heard all about you, Tony. Come on.

23:27.648 --> 23:29.480
Let's get you two lovebirds home.

23:53.007 --> 23:54.333
Ta-da!

23:54.408 --> 23:56.135
Oh, um...

23:56.210 --> 23:59.146
you can pee into the basin at night,
if you wish.

24:34.748 --> 24:36.046
Not bad, eh?

24:37.685 --> 24:39.017
Jack.

24:40.120 --> 24:41.679
I'm the big brother.

24:41.755 --> 24:43.182
Tony.

24:43.257 --> 24:46.085
- We've heard all about you, Tony.
- Oh?

24:46.861 --> 24:49.522
How do you like your lamb, Tony?

24:49.597 --> 24:51.088
Sorry?

24:51.732 --> 24:54.292
We're having lamb this evening.

24:54.368 --> 24:56.803
Oh. I see.

24:57.404 --> 24:59.134
Excellent.

25:00.908 --> 25:05.403
I'm, uh, I'm partial to a bit
of rare meat myself.

25:12.486 --> 25:13.886
I'll let you get settled.

25:39.647 --> 25:41.841
Here, Tony, have some roast potatoes.

25:41.916 --> 25:43.145
Thank you.

25:44.885 --> 25:46.812
Thank you, Mrs. Ford, it all looks lovely.

25:46.887 --> 25:49.114
Hear, hear. Motion seconded.

25:49.189 --> 25:50.623
And me, please, Mother.

25:52.126 --> 25:53.389
Thank you.

25:54.094 --> 25:56.529
- How many?
- One more, please.

25:57.998 --> 25:59.193
Pass it down.

26:00.801 --> 26:02.167
Do start.

26:10.878 --> 26:14.640
Uh, a friend of mine's
at Cambridge, as it happens.

26:14.715 --> 26:16.547
Uh, Adrian Finn?

26:17.851 --> 26:21.344
- Should I know him?
- Uh, he's studying philosophy.

26:22.556 --> 26:24.491
My deepest sympathies.

26:27.828 --> 26:31.390
And what about you, Tony?
You haven't told us what your subject is.

26:32.199 --> 26:34.225
English literature.

26:34.301 --> 26:36.395
And what do you hope to do
with an undergraduate degree

26:36.470 --> 26:37.870
in English literature?

26:39.473 --> 26:41.700
Well, um...

26:41.775 --> 26:43.334
I-I hope to write.

26:43.410 --> 26:45.242
- Write?
- Yes.

26:46.347 --> 26:48.873
Um, poems. Poetry.

26:50.117 --> 26:52.245
A poet?

27:00.494 --> 27:03.289
And who's your favorite poet?

27:03.364 --> 27:04.990
Mum.

27:05.065 --> 27:07.826
- Dylan Thomas.
- Ah, yes, yes.

27:07.901 --> 27:10.062
The gloomy Welshman.

27:10.137 --> 27:12.629
"And the winds did bloom,

27:12.706 --> 27:15.067
and the brides in the wooed field

27:15.142 --> 27:18.103
did sew the coming summer frost."

27:18.178 --> 27:20.909
Ah, bravo, Jack.

27:22.182 --> 27:24.208
See what I have to put up with, Tony?

27:27.354 --> 27:29.815
I'm partial to a little Larkin myself.

27:29.890 --> 27:31.617
Oh, yes.

27:31.692 --> 27:33.684
He's wonderful, also.

27:36.296 --> 27:40.131
"I work all day, and get half drunk at night.

27:43.203 --> 27:47.163
Waking at four to soundless dark...

27:48.308 --> 27:50.072
I stare.

27:51.578 --> 27:55.606
In time, the curtain-edges will go bright."

28:13.967 --> 28:15.731
Hear, hear.

28:36.457 --> 28:37.985
So...

28:39.693 --> 28:41.559
Good night, then.

28:43.564 --> 28:47.097
Wait, I didn't say anything
embarrassing at dinner, did I?

28:48.569 --> 28:50.295
Why are you whispering?

28:50.370 --> 28:51.764
I don't know.

28:51.839 --> 28:53.205
Sorry.

29:04.885 --> 29:08.322
I hope you sleep the sleep of the wicked.

29:48.171 --> 29:52.339
It's important you understand the scale
of sexual frustration of my younger self.

29:53.176 --> 29:56.146
For God's sake. You poor thing.

30:03.720 --> 30:07.749
You sure there isn't some un-doused
fire in your breast, Mr. Webster?

30:07.824 --> 30:09.258
Quite sure.

30:10.426 --> 30:14.622
So if... let's presume,
still unmarried fruitcake

30:14.697 --> 30:17.091
walked into this restaurant now

30:17.166 --> 30:19.931
and sat in that table...

30:20.937 --> 30:23.531
how would the long-divorced
Mr. Anthony Webster react?

30:23.606 --> 30:26.838
I don't think I'd be
especially pleased to see her.

30:28.111 --> 30:31.570
So you wouldn't start rolling up
your sleeves and turning over your watch?

30:31.648 --> 30:34.208
God. I wish I'd never told you that.

30:35.284 --> 30:37.651
Can we have another... More coffee?

30:43.993 --> 30:46.553
Come on, let's hear the rest of it.

30:48.097 --> 30:49.759
Morning.

30:50.733 --> 30:54.795
- You looking for something?
- No, I was just looking.

30:57.373 --> 30:59.634
The others have gone for a walk.

30:59.709 --> 31:04.178
Veronica said you'd prefer a lie-in,
so we opted not to disturb you.

31:06.816 --> 31:08.182
You hungry?

31:09.619 --> 31:10.609
Uh, yes.

31:14.123 --> 31:16.014
Have a seat.

31:42.919 --> 31:46.321
You won't let Veronica get away
with too much, will you?

31:48.524 --> 31:49.514
Sorry?

31:51.527 --> 31:53.257
Don't let her get away with too much.

31:57.567 --> 32:00.264
Sorry, I'm not quite sure
I follow your meaning.

32:01.037 --> 32:02.903
Oh! Damn it!

32:07.110 --> 32:08.840
Whoops.

32:10.413 --> 32:11.813
Sorry.

32:13.216 --> 32:15.618
I'm normally very good at eggs.

32:17.620 --> 32:20.253
- Tony, let me give you a hand.
- Thank you.

32:24.660 --> 32:26.822
Well, Jack.

32:28.898 --> 32:30.491
He'll do, I suppose.

32:33.636 --> 32:36.330
Thanks for staying the weekend, Tony.

32:36.405 --> 32:38.704
Thank you, Mrs. Ford.

33:01.364 --> 33:03.265
I like your mum.

33:04.632 --> 33:07.100
Sounds like you've got a rival, Vron.

33:07.603 --> 33:09.469
Come to think of it,
sounds like you're not the only one.

33:11.407 --> 33:13.367
Excuse me, I'm still speaking.

33:13.442 --> 33:15.369
You don't say.

33:15.444 --> 33:17.205
Something is clearly going on.

33:17.280 --> 33:21.976
Someone you knew long ago
has left you something or other.

33:22.051 --> 33:25.613
Exactly. Which has been
unduly withheld from me

33:25.688 --> 33:27.415
and to which I am legally entitled.

33:27.490 --> 33:31.291
Well, you could fight it,
or you can just let it go.

33:32.428 --> 33:35.023
Cash the check, take me on a budget holiday.

33:35.832 --> 33:38.659
250 each, get us to the Channel lslands.

33:38.734 --> 33:41.499
- Listen, the point I...
- Something is certainly going on.

33:43.206 --> 33:46.176
So just call me when you
really want to talk about it.

33:54.750 --> 33:57.777
Oh, and the foot's much better,
thanks for asking.

33:57.854 --> 34:00.449
How is it, the foot?

35:01.417 --> 35:06.113
So, I passed on your letters,
all 13 of them, to Miss Ford.

35:06.188 --> 35:09.181
- And?
- While Miss Ford is still not ready

35:09.258 --> 35:10.851
to part with the diary.

35:10.927 --> 35:15.026
I can tell you that the diary, it seems,
belonged to a Mr. Adrian Finn.

35:16.933 --> 35:18.226
I see.

35:18.301 --> 35:21.662
Now, I've raised your concern
in terms of if or when

35:21.737 --> 35:24.229
you might be able to receive
Mr. Finn's diary.

35:24.307 --> 35:25.666
Let me get this straight.

35:25.741 --> 35:28.970
She should have handed the diary over to you.

35:29.045 --> 35:30.371
She hasn't.

35:30.446 --> 35:34.375
You've asked for it,
but she's refusing to give it up.

35:34.450 --> 35:36.851
Yes, that's-that's certainly
how things stand at present.

35:42.758 --> 35:46.053
In my experience, Mr. Webster,

35:46.128 --> 35:49.557
people often like to take some time out
following a bereavement.

35:49.632 --> 35:51.592
Don't you think?

35:51.667 --> 35:54.128
That's as may be.

35:54.203 --> 35:56.695
But I want to be quite sure

35:56.772 --> 36:01.233
that you are clear that
that diary belongs to me.

36:16.492 --> 36:18.252
Hello.

36:18.327 --> 36:21.155
Andrew, this is Tony, my ex-husband.

36:21.230 --> 36:22.254
Ah.

36:22.331 --> 36:24.323
How are you doing, Tony? All right?

36:24.400 --> 36:27.094
- Hi.
- We work together.

36:27.169 --> 36:29.570
Can we talk? It's important.

36:31.207 --> 36:34.001
Well, I'll leave you to it, then.

36:34.076 --> 36:35.736
Good to meet you, Tony.

36:35.811 --> 36:36.904
I'll see you Monday.

36:41.517 --> 36:44.812
This is not on, Tony, coming around
without being asked, sorry.

36:44.887 --> 36:48.051
You told me to call when I was ready
to tell you what was going on.

36:50.760 --> 36:52.353
You gonna let me in?

36:52.428 --> 36:54.420
...from summer to autumn.

36:54.497 --> 36:56.791
So, too, do we think ahead...

36:56.866 --> 36:58.559
Rather him than us.

36:58.634 --> 37:01.297
...to what we may achieve together.

37:15.518 --> 37:16.986
Good morning, gentlemen.

37:18.788 --> 37:23.488
I trust that you had good holidays,
but time and tide tarry for no man, so...

37:27.463 --> 37:29.625
Henry VIII.

37:30.866 --> 37:35.327
Which of you bright young things can give me

37:35.404 --> 37:37.896
a characterization of the age, hmm?

37:40.009 --> 37:40.999
Hmm?

37:43.546 --> 37:44.775
Simpson.

37:45.414 --> 37:47.041
Any thoughts?

37:47.116 --> 37:49.043
There was unrest, sir.

37:49.118 --> 37:52.145
No, no, insightful, as always.

37:52.221 --> 37:55.714
But might you perhaps care to elaborate?

37:57.326 --> 37:59.693
There was great unrest, sir.

38:02.932 --> 38:04.392
Oh, dear.

38:04.467 --> 38:06.026
Anyone?

38:11.907 --> 38:12.897
Finn?

38:12.975 --> 38:15.968
Now, I'm conscious
it's your first day with us,

38:16.045 --> 38:20.073
but, um, any thoughts?

38:23.185 --> 38:25.546
- I don't know.
- What don't you know?

38:25.621 --> 38:27.481
Well, I cannot know what I don't know, sir,

38:27.556 --> 38:30.685
that's philosophically self-evident.

38:31.560 --> 38:35.622
What we do know is that
something happened, sir.

38:35.698 --> 38:36.857
Come again?

38:36.932 --> 38:39.925
Well, something happened.

38:40.002 --> 38:44.531
All one can ever truly say of
any particular period of history, sir,

38:44.607 --> 38:46.235
is that something happened.

38:48.944 --> 38:51.072
Hey, um, great line to Hunt, earlier.

38:51.147 --> 38:52.506
About something happened?

38:52.581 --> 38:54.208
Oh, yes.

38:54.283 --> 38:55.943
I was disappointed he didn't take that up.

38:56.018 --> 38:58.712
Well, I thought you made
an extremely valid point.

38:58.787 --> 39:00.681
I'm, uh, Tony Webster.

39:00.756 --> 39:02.054
I'm Adrian Finn.

39:09.832 --> 39:11.292
It's cheery.

39:11.367 --> 39:13.260
Are you familiar with Dylan Thomas?

39:13.335 --> 39:14.928
Hmm, yes.

39:15.738 --> 39:18.966
I find him to be one of the most
humane poets of the 20th century.

39:19.041 --> 39:20.805
...but then he did say it, it was ridiculous.

39:22.276 --> 39:24.672
Parents, what a load of effing bastards.

39:24.747 --> 39:28.206
Adrian Finn, Colin Simpson.
Colin Simpson, Adrian Finn.

39:28.284 --> 39:31.212
- Hello, Adrian Finn.
- And, uh, this is Alex Stuart.

39:31.287 --> 39:34.548
Oh, really great line to Hunt, really great.

39:34.623 --> 39:35.850
Is there an issue with your parents?

39:35.925 --> 39:37.951
Ugh, "issue" is putting it mildly.

39:38.027 --> 39:39.253
Just when you think you can trust them...

39:39.328 --> 39:42.223
- Effing bastards.
- Just when you think you can trust them,

39:42.298 --> 39:44.091
- they go and behave like...
- Henry VIII?

39:44.166 --> 39:47.428
Like Henry the fucking VIII, exactly.

39:47.503 --> 39:49.430
Why are all your watches turned inside?

39:49.505 --> 39:51.732
- Ah, because...
- That is a very good question.

39:51.807 --> 39:54.235
- We're taking a stand against...
- Hierarchically imposed...

39:54.310 --> 39:56.670
- ...intrinsically flawed...
- ...notions of time.

39:56.745 --> 39:58.475
It also looks quite cool.

40:00.149 --> 40:02.977
So, Dylan Thomas, interesting.

40:03.052 --> 40:04.111
Yes.

40:05.321 --> 40:07.381
- Any good?
- Do you know him?

40:07.456 --> 40:09.789
- Not really.
- Not personally.

40:16.999 --> 40:19.594
Really sick of staring at wood paneling.

40:40.856 --> 40:42.654
I'm sorry to report...

40:44.360 --> 40:46.420
that I have some rather sad news

40:46.495 --> 40:48.862
which I wish to share
with you all this morning.

40:50.132 --> 40:53.068
Joseph Dobson, of the Science Sixth...

40:54.169 --> 40:56.138
has been found dead.

40:58.374 --> 41:01.702
He was a gifted pupil with a natural aptitude

41:01.777 --> 41:05.706
for both science and modern languages.

41:05.781 --> 41:09.775
He was sadly cut down
in the flower of his youth...

41:09.852 --> 41:12.720
"Flower"? Dobson is more vegetable material.

41:13.988 --> 41:15.382
Was.

41:15.457 --> 41:16.784
Must have killed himself.

41:16.859 --> 41:19.119
...his brother, sister...

41:19.194 --> 41:20.253
- What?
- Shit.

41:20.329 --> 41:25.192
Finn, you're unusually quiet this afternoon.

41:25.267 --> 41:28.635
I'm not sure I can add
anything to the debate, sir.

41:30.406 --> 41:33.067
Will wonders never cease?

41:33.142 --> 41:36.670
I don't find the historian's need
to ascribe responsibility

41:36.745 --> 41:38.907
a particularly fruitful arena, sir.

41:40.215 --> 41:41.911
Care to elaborate?

41:43.485 --> 41:47.414
Historians yearn for an answer to the
question of who's to blame for this event

41:47.489 --> 41:51.252
or for that atrocity, but...
I don't know, sir.

41:51.327 --> 41:55.321
Sometimes it seems to me
it is impossible to know.

41:55.397 --> 41:56.757
Go on.

41:56.832 --> 41:59.324
Well, Patrick Lagrange, sir, said that,

41:59.401 --> 42:01.729
"History is the certainty
produced at the point

42:01.804 --> 42:05.764
when the imperfections of memory
meet the inadequacies of documentation."

42:05.841 --> 42:07.810
It's the lies of victors, sir.

42:09.244 --> 42:13.407
As long as you understand that it is also
the delusions of the defeated.

42:13.482 --> 42:15.951
Take Dobson's suicide, sir.

42:19.321 --> 42:20.714
Okay.

42:20.789 --> 42:23.417
We are told Dobson came to take his own life,

42:23.492 --> 42:25.919
perhaps when he understood
his girlfriend was pregnant.

42:25.994 --> 42:27.855
Finn...

42:27.930 --> 42:29.623
Dobson's death is a private matter.

42:29.698 --> 42:33.692
No... it's also a historical matter.

42:35.604 --> 42:38.732
The point I'm trying to make, sir,
is that nothing can now be known

42:38.807 --> 42:41.168
in the absence of Dobson's own testimony.

42:41.243 --> 42:43.070
We...

42:43.145 --> 42:45.171
we may never know the truth.

42:45.247 --> 42:46.738
And...

42:46.815 --> 42:50.445
no amount of intellectual posturing
can alter that.

42:51.687 --> 42:54.815
Do you see the problem, sir?

42:54.890 --> 42:58.118
Finn, I see the problem, thank you.

42:58.193 --> 43:02.597
Camus says that suicide is
the only true philosophical question.

43:04.099 --> 43:07.361
Apart from ethics, politics, aesthetics,

43:07.436 --> 43:09.029
and all that other stuff.

43:09.104 --> 43:11.096
All that other stuff
we're learning about in school.

43:11.173 --> 43:12.833
- About the beauty and wisdom...
- The only true one.

43:12.908 --> 43:15.468
The essential one on which
all the others depend.

43:17.146 --> 43:19.973
When we left school
and went our separate ways,

43:20.048 --> 43:24.181
out of everyone, Adrian was the only one
I desperately wanted to stay in touch with.

43:30.159 --> 43:32.060
Lovely. Thank you.

43:43.772 --> 43:45.764
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

43:49.678 --> 43:51.038
Mm!

43:51.113 --> 43:52.873
That is good.

43:52.948 --> 43:55.213
I dare say it's almost as good as sex.

43:55.784 --> 43:57.480
Couldn't possibly comment.

43:58.053 --> 44:00.914
Maybe I need to improve my taste in wine.

44:00.989 --> 44:03.015
Or your taste in sex.

44:06.995 --> 44:09.356
Speaking of which,
are we going to address the fact

44:09.431 --> 44:13.694
that almost everything
you've told me in the last few days,

44:13.769 --> 44:16.830
you've told me for the very first time?

44:16.905 --> 44:19.767
I've never told you about all this stuff
because it wasn't important.

44:19.842 --> 44:22.736
In all the years that
we were together, Mr. Webster,

44:22.811 --> 44:25.606
it has never occurred to you
that it might be important to tell me

44:25.681 --> 44:27.775
about your former love?

44:27.850 --> 44:30.711
Your first love, no doubt.

44:30.786 --> 44:32.579
I'm not talking about Adrian Finn.

44:32.654 --> 44:34.415
I see.

44:34.490 --> 44:39.253
Well, Mrs. Webster, I think you're
very much barking up the wrong tree.

44:39.328 --> 44:42.923
Indeed, on the wrong
patch of land altogether.

44:42.998 --> 44:45.763
Veronica and I were never in love,
I can assure you.

44:47.336 --> 44:50.465
She gave you your first camera, didn't she?

45:52.568 --> 45:55.197
Mm, Tony, it doesn't feel right.

47:58.894 --> 48:01.420
Do you ever think about where
our relationship is heading?

48:06.735 --> 48:10.467
Is this a thinly-veiled attempt
to bring up our sex life?

48:12.407 --> 48:13.636
No.

48:15.310 --> 48:19.480
I'm positively laidback about
the fact that we haven't had sex yet.

48:28.323 --> 48:30.224
Does it have to?

48:32.194 --> 48:34.322
Does it have to what?

48:36.098 --> 48:38.465
Head somewhere? Our relationship.

48:48.777 --> 48:50.504
At the time I thought, at least nobody died.

48:50.579 --> 48:51.945
Nobody got pregnant.

48:53.014 --> 48:55.442
You sound positively crestfallen.

48:55.517 --> 48:57.247
Mm.

48:58.453 --> 49:01.981
Oh, please, no. I'll be all over the place.

49:02.057 --> 49:03.583
Stop.

49:06.061 --> 49:10.497
But how did your friend's diary
end up with fruitcake's mother?

49:11.466 --> 49:14.661
I think Adrian's stuff
ended up with Veronica.

49:14.736 --> 49:17.664
And that's how the diary
found its way to Sarah Ford.

49:17.739 --> 49:21.034
Yeah, but how did Adrian's stuff
end up with fruitcake?

49:21.109 --> 49:23.544
Veronica. I was just coming to that.

49:41.763 --> 49:45.525
Dear, Tony, I wanted to write
to you as in recent months,

49:45.600 --> 49:48.627
Veronica and I have grown very close.

49:48.703 --> 49:52.599
Indeed, we have now embarked
upon a relationship together.

49:52.674 --> 49:54.334
This would no doubt come to your attention,

49:54.409 --> 49:57.738
and we thought it best you heard it from us.

49:57.813 --> 50:00.578
Your friendship is deeply
important to us, Tony.

52:08.109 --> 52:09.941
When did you last see him, then?

52:13.148 --> 52:15.708
About three months ago.

52:15.784 --> 52:18.549
Right where you're sitting.
That's why I suggested it.

52:20.455 --> 52:22.686
He was going down to Chislehurst.

52:25.060 --> 52:27.859
- How did he seem?
- Cheerful.

52:29.030 --> 52:30.965
Happy, like himself.

52:31.533 --> 52:33.024
Only more so.

52:36.805 --> 52:39.707
As we said good-bye,
he told me he was in love.

52:52.754 --> 52:55.982
- How did he do it?
- Wrists in the bath.

52:56.057 --> 52:57.350
Jesus Christ.

52:57.425 --> 52:59.519
He knew how to do it.

52:59.594 --> 53:01.153
Diagonally.

53:01.229 --> 53:04.090
If you, uh, cut straight across,

53:04.165 --> 53:07.360
you lose consciousness
and the wound heals up.

53:07.435 --> 53:08.662
You botched it.

53:08.737 --> 53:10.964
Well, perhaps you drown yourself.

53:11.039 --> 53:12.871
No, still second place.

53:13.775 --> 53:15.403
Adrian would have wanted first.

53:18.847 --> 53:20.679
Sort of Greek, isn't it?

53:21.716 --> 53:24.378
No, it's, um, hemlock.

53:24.820 --> 53:27.314
More the exemplary Roman, I'd say.

53:27.389 --> 53:29.415
Opening the vein.

53:32.794 --> 53:35.354
- It's effing impressive.
- Yeah.

53:36.097 --> 53:37.929
Or a miserable waste.

53:39.768 --> 53:41.600
So what do you think
you'll find in the diary?

53:42.904 --> 53:45.601
I've no idea. It's just mine.

53:48.009 --> 53:50.535
I think it's quite touching
that you're so stubborn.

53:51.946 --> 53:54.841
Probably a way of
not losing the plot at your age.

53:54.916 --> 53:58.585
I don't think I'd reacted any differently
when we were younger.

54:02.524 --> 54:05.652
Do you remember that au pair we had?

54:05.727 --> 54:07.487
The...

54:07.562 --> 54:09.656
- Swedish one?
- Mm.

54:10.698 --> 54:12.792
I found her diary once.

54:13.568 --> 54:14.861
And I...

54:14.936 --> 54:16.871
I was tidying up, and I read it.

54:17.806 --> 54:20.000
Do you know what I found?

54:20.075 --> 54:22.772
She'd written, "I'm working for a real cow."

54:24.913 --> 54:28.042
"Husband's all right,
just keeps looking at my arse."

54:31.319 --> 54:34.050
Uh, you should have said,
we'd have got rid of her.

54:39.594 --> 54:42.086
That's not the point of my story.

54:46.167 --> 54:47.827
- It's getting late.
- Is it?

54:47.902 --> 54:51.064
Surely you're not insisting
your inebriated ex

54:51.139 --> 54:52.999
risks his life on the open road?

54:53.074 --> 54:54.599
Collateral damage.

54:54.676 --> 54:56.603
Think about my fellow drivers, then.

54:56.678 --> 54:58.650
You're not staying.

55:19.434 --> 55:20.424
Good night, then.

55:20.502 --> 55:22.061
Wait, wait, wait. I've got a question.

55:22.137 --> 55:23.662
Got a question.

55:27.442 --> 55:29.877
Why did you leave me?

55:31.646 --> 55:32.875
Be honest.

55:33.815 --> 55:35.442
Tony...

55:35.517 --> 55:37.884
No, be honest. No, tell me.

55:40.121 --> 55:41.919
Did you leave because of me?

55:45.860 --> 55:48.022
Are you angry about Veronica?

55:49.164 --> 55:52.623
I'm not anything about Veronica.

55:58.839 --> 56:00.808
Wasn't that bad, was it?

56:02.877 --> 56:05.472
- Good night, Tony.
- Good night.

56:58.333 --> 57:00.460
- Tony Webster.
- Colin Simpson.

57:00.535 --> 57:02.395
- How the devil are you?
- Wonderful to see you.

57:02.470 --> 57:03.930
- Alex...
- Good to see you.

57:04.005 --> 57:05.165
Great to see you.

57:05.240 --> 57:07.000
You go and get in, sit in there.

57:07.075 --> 57:08.201
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

57:08.276 --> 57:09.710
Go on, go, go, go, go.

57:13.548 --> 57:15.008
Do you want a tea?

57:15.083 --> 57:17.810
Boys, you haven't changed. I will have a tea.

57:17.885 --> 57:19.683
Excuse me, love, could we have another tea?

57:23.524 --> 57:25.285
Blimey.

57:25.360 --> 57:26.885
What a nut job.

57:26.961 --> 57:28.721
What ever did you see in her?

57:28.796 --> 57:30.788
You and Adrian both.

57:30.865 --> 57:34.461
Well, you know, she was very mysterious.

57:35.670 --> 57:40.033
You know, the great irony, of course,
was that it was you that introduced them.

57:40.108 --> 57:41.301
Introduced who?

57:41.376 --> 57:43.136
Adrian and Veronica.

57:43.211 --> 57:46.704
No, Adrian met Veronica
through her brother Jack.

57:46.781 --> 57:49.742
Oh, wishful thinking, my old friend.

57:49.817 --> 57:50.807
No.

57:50.885 --> 57:52.979
Yeah, Adrian and Jack
were at Cambridge together.

57:53.054 --> 57:54.180
But that's not how they met.

57:54.255 --> 57:56.883
No, it was your fault that they got together.

57:56.958 --> 57:58.851
- Hole-in-one.
- No, no, no.

57:58.926 --> 58:02.455
You came up to town from Bristol
with your ladylove and you met all of us.

58:02.530 --> 58:06.023
Yeah, chomping at the bit
to introduce the love of your life.

58:07.502 --> 58:10.396
Oh, I could've sworn they met through Jack.

58:10.471 --> 58:12.198
Afraid not.

58:12.273 --> 58:15.201
I'm surprised you haven't had a good
rummage through the Webster albums.

58:15.276 --> 58:17.438
If memory serves,
you were always snapping away.

58:18.079 --> 58:22.642
Hmm. They must have been
deemed surplus to requirements.

58:41.069 --> 58:43.263
Mm, that's a pity, old bean.

58:43.338 --> 58:46.365
So have you... have you tried

58:46.441 --> 58:50.139
- contacting her directly?
- How?

58:51.245 --> 58:53.839
- She's not there. Try Jack.
- Okay.

58:59.053 --> 59:00.413
Oh, right.

59:00.488 --> 59:02.186
Loads of them.

59:02.924 --> 59:03.914
What about...

59:03.991 --> 59:05.885
- What that...
- This one?

59:05.960 --> 59:06.950
Oh, it's him.

59:07.028 --> 59:08.018
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

59:08.096 --> 59:09.086
Yeah, yeah.

59:09.163 --> 59:10.153
Wow.

59:10.231 --> 59:11.221
- God.
- Where on earth is he?

59:11.299 --> 59:12.692
Cricket.

59:12.767 --> 59:13.860
- Tennis, no?
- Tennis.

59:13.935 --> 59:15.335
Oh, look.

59:16.471 --> 59:17.962
- Who's that?
- I don't know.

59:18.039 --> 59:19.029
This is very nice.

59:19.107 --> 59:21.505
He looks as self-satisfied as he ever did.

59:28.116 --> 59:29.876
Do you want to send him a message?

59:29.951 --> 59:33.410
- Isn't that a bit much?
- No, it'd be rude not to.

59:35.256 --> 59:37.684
Do people really communicate this way?

59:37.759 --> 59:39.785
Yours truly communicates this way.

59:39.861 --> 59:40.851
- Really?
- Yeah.

59:40.928 --> 59:43.488
I-I got in touch with a woman
I'd been at university with.

59:43.564 --> 59:45.425
Hadn't seen her for
the best part of 40 years.

59:45.500 --> 59:48.294
We met up, got on like a house on fire.

59:48.369 --> 59:51.664
- Oh, great.
- You see, it's a boon for us widowers.

59:51.739 --> 59:53.166
- Mm.
- Hmm.

59:53.241 --> 59:54.231
There you go.

59:54.308 --> 59:55.702
Sent.

59:55.777 --> 59:57.704
Oh, done.

59:57.779 --> 59:59.739
- What?
- You're in now.

59:59.814 --> 01:00:03.142
Welcome to the 21st century, Mr. Webster.

01:00:03.217 --> 01:00:04.344
Oh, blimey.

01:00:04.419 --> 01:00:06.217
Ta-ra.

01:00:09.056 --> 01:00:12.151
- Tell us how it all turns out.
- Certainly will.

01:00:12.226 --> 01:00:13.717
Don't let it get to you, old bean.

01:00:13.795 --> 01:00:15.388
Insightful as always.

01:00:19.267 --> 01:00:21.494
Henry VIII.

01:00:21.569 --> 01:00:24.364
"Now, which one of you
young bright things can offer

01:00:24.439 --> 01:00:26.165
a characterization of the age?

01:00:26.240 --> 01:00:27.230
Simpson?"

01:00:27.308 --> 01:00:29.035
I'd say there was unrest, sir.

01:00:29.110 --> 01:00:31.739
I'd even say there was great unrest, sir.

01:00:50.998 --> 01:00:54.162
# I feel so sad, I feel depressed #

01:00:56.637 --> 01:01:00.130
# 'Cause you're the best girl
that I've ever had #

01:01:02.443 --> 01:01:06.175
# I can't get your love,
I can't get affection #

01:01:08.616 --> 01:01:12.845
# Oh, little girl, psychotic reaction #

01:01:12.920 --> 01:01:15.014
# And it feels like this #

01:01:29.971 --> 01:01:32.463
Not enjoying the party?

01:01:48.456 --> 01:01:50.015
Oh, shit.

01:01:55.062 --> 01:01:56.222
Hello, you have reached

01:01:56.297 --> 01:01:57.723
- telephone of Anthony Webster.
- Bollocks!

01:01:57.798 --> 01:01:59.357
I'm unable to take your call now.

01:01:59.433 --> 01:02:01.327
Please leave me a message after the beep,

01:02:01.402 --> 01:02:03.928
and I will return your call
at my earliest convenience.

01:02:04.005 --> 01:02:05.400
Thank you.

01:02:07.708 --> 01:02:08.968
Hello.

01:02:09.043 --> 01:02:12.536
This is Veronica Ford.

01:02:12.613 --> 01:02:16.175
I am in receipt of all your correspondence,

01:02:16.250 --> 01:02:18.644
and I also understand from my brother

01:02:18.719 --> 01:02:21.245
that you wish to meet
to discuss my mother's estate.

01:02:22.890 --> 01:02:24.791
I will be in town this morning.

01:02:26.494 --> 01:02:29.020
I will see you at the wobbly bridge
at 9:00 a.m.

01:02:38.005 --> 01:02:39.599
Shit.

01:03:01.562 --> 01:03:05.090
# Time has told me #

01:03:08.302 --> 01:03:11.932
# You're a rare, rare find #

01:03:14.909 --> 01:03:18.804
# Trouble cure #

01:03:18.879 --> 01:03:21.073
Could I get a glass of red wine, please?

01:03:21.148 --> 01:03:24.676
# For a troubled mind #

01:03:27.955 --> 01:03:31.323
# And time has told me #

01:03:34.261 --> 01:03:38.164
# Not to ask for more #

01:03:40.735 --> 01:03:44.172
# For some day our ocean #

01:03:46.741 --> 01:03:49.569
# Will find its shore... #

01:03:49.644 --> 01:03:51.571
Are you...

01:03:51.646 --> 01:03:53.114
are you sure?

01:03:53.948 --> 01:03:55.644
Really, Anthony.

01:03:57.985 --> 01:04:00.413
You said it didn't feel right
when we were going out.

01:04:00.488 --> 01:04:02.548
No, it didn't... then.

01:04:03.924 --> 01:04:05.688
But it does now?

01:04:10.197 --> 01:04:12.029
I don't know.

01:04:15.136 --> 01:04:17.162
You're quite cowardly, aren't you?

01:04:20.307 --> 01:04:23.744
# Time has told me #

01:04:26.280 --> 01:04:29.978
# You came with the dawn #

01:04:32.787 --> 01:04:36.451
# A soul with no footprint... #

01:04:39.694 --> 01:04:41.253
Veronica?

01:04:45.766 --> 01:04:48.628
- Hello, Anthony.
- You look well.

01:04:48.703 --> 01:04:50.729
You're bald.

01:04:52.640 --> 01:04:54.609
Well, at least it proves
I'm not an alcoholic.

01:04:56.877 --> 01:04:58.738
Do people think you're an alcoholic?

01:04:58.813 --> 01:05:00.873
No. No, they don't.

01:05:01.982 --> 01:05:04.076
I read somewhere that
if you're a very heavy drinker,

01:05:04.151 --> 01:05:07.417
there's something in the booze
that stops your hair from falling out.

01:05:11.625 --> 01:05:13.491
Shall we find somewhere to sit down?

01:05:14.695 --> 01:05:15.788
Where?

01:05:15.863 --> 01:05:18.526
Anywhere? I'm easy, as you may recall.

01:05:25.473 --> 01:05:26.732
Ready to order?

01:05:26.807 --> 01:05:29.101
- Um...
- I'll have a fresh mint tea, please.

01:05:29.176 --> 01:05:31.871
Um, what sort of coffee do you serve?

01:05:31.946 --> 01:05:33.437
We serve our own blend.

01:05:33.514 --> 01:05:35.141
Roasted in our roastery in Herne Hill.

01:05:35.216 --> 01:05:36.409
Oh, blimey. Uh...

01:05:36.484 --> 01:05:38.244
We don't mess around.

01:05:38.319 --> 01:05:40.212
Uh, in that case,
I'll have a macchiato, please.

01:05:40.287 --> 01:05:42.847
- Single or double?
- Single, thank you.

01:05:42.923 --> 01:05:44.289
Thank you.

01:05:47.228 --> 01:05:48.954
Their own blend.

01:05:49.029 --> 01:05:50.964
Impressive stuff.

01:05:56.771 --> 01:05:59.297
I was sorry to hear about
your mother, Veronica.

01:06:00.608 --> 01:06:02.133
Yes.

01:06:02.810 --> 01:06:05.803
As, uh, as you're no doubt aware,

01:06:05.880 --> 01:06:09.715
it appears that your mother
left something to me in her will.

01:06:10.851 --> 01:06:14.817
And when I spoke
with your mother's solicitor...

01:06:16.357 --> 01:06:20.186
I was told that the item
that has been left to me was...

01:06:20.261 --> 01:06:22.787
um, a diary written by Adrian.

01:06:26.801 --> 01:06:29.862
- I don't have the diary.
- Excuse me?

01:06:29.937 --> 01:06:31.667
I burnt it.

01:06:32.573 --> 01:06:34.433
But it belongs to me.

01:06:34.508 --> 01:06:36.033
- It doesn't belong to anyone.
- Vroom, vroom, vroom!

01:06:36.110 --> 01:06:37.937
Look!

01:06:38.012 --> 01:06:41.210
I think you'll find that the zoo
is north of the river.

01:06:44.184 --> 01:06:45.585
Unbelievable.

01:06:48.823 --> 01:06:52.118
Uh... I at least have,

01:06:52.193 --> 01:06:55.186
uh, the right to know what is in it.

01:06:55.996 --> 01:06:58.124
Legally, yes.

01:06:59.266 --> 01:07:01.093
Morally, no.

01:07:01.168 --> 01:07:04.897
Have you any idea
how unsettling it was for me after,

01:07:04.972 --> 01:07:07.498
however many years it's been,

01:07:07.575 --> 01:07:10.238
to receive a letter from your mother?

01:07:11.178 --> 01:07:14.406
I can't be held accountable
for my mother's actions.

01:07:14.481 --> 01:07:18.948
Actually, as executor of her will,
I rather suggest that you can.

01:07:44.311 --> 01:07:46.639
What's this?

01:07:46.714 --> 01:07:48.945
Because you seem to need something to read.

01:07:50.985 --> 01:07:53.750
- Bye, Anthony.
- I'm-I'm sorry I raised my voice.

01:10:23.270 --> 01:10:24.738
Hi.

01:10:33.213 --> 01:10:35.607
- Sorry.
- That wasn't five minutes.

01:10:35.682 --> 01:10:37.042
No, I know, it's...

01:10:37.117 --> 01:10:38.544
Oh, quick. Right.

01:10:38.619 --> 01:10:41.589
Traffic was dreadful. I'm really sorry.

01:10:42.222 --> 01:10:43.482
So this is it, is it?

01:10:43.557 --> 01:10:46.018
No, it's a spectacularly
elaborate wind-up, Dad.

01:10:46.093 --> 01:10:48.085
Yeah, sorry. Sorry, point taken.

01:10:48.162 --> 01:10:49.488
Have you heard from Mum?

01:10:49.563 --> 01:10:53.661
Uh, no, no, but I phoned her and she's
in a meeting, but I left a message.

01:10:58.072 --> 01:10:59.631
Right. Okay.

01:10:59.706 --> 01:11:01.472
Off we go.

01:11:06.146 --> 01:11:09.139
- Dad, I think I'm gonna be sick.
- You're gonna be sick?

01:11:13.287 --> 01:11:16.515
Oh, this whole thing's such a load of shit.

01:11:16.590 --> 01:11:19.885
I mean, our gene pool alone is bad enough.

01:11:19.960 --> 01:11:22.054
Workaholic meets curmudgeon

01:11:22.129 --> 01:11:23.822
- meets deranged 30-something.
- You're not a curmudgeon.

01:11:23.897 --> 01:11:26.423
- I was talking about you.
- I know, darling.

01:11:26.500 --> 01:11:28.327
The best thing you can do is just relax,

01:11:28.402 --> 01:11:29.695
- calm down.
- Look, don't tell me to relax.

01:11:29.770 --> 01:11:32.638
Jesus. Just call Mum.

01:11:34.541 --> 01:11:35.801
Afternoon, I'm Emma.

01:11:35.876 --> 01:11:37.936
Hi, Emma. I'm Tony. This is Susie.

01:11:38.011 --> 01:11:40.906
- How we doing?
- We're having a bit of a wobble.

01:11:40.981 --> 01:11:42.741
Oh, for Christ's sake, Dad.

01:11:42.816 --> 01:11:45.611
All right, I'll leave you two to it, okay?

01:11:45.686 --> 01:11:48.451
- Where are you going?
- Isn't that what you want?

01:11:49.456 --> 01:11:51.884
Do you want me to stay?
Do you want me to go? Call Mum?

01:11:51.959 --> 01:11:53.120
Yes.

01:11:54.128 --> 01:11:56.097
Right, right.

01:12:20.287 --> 01:12:22.051
Good night, Harry.

01:12:33.500 --> 01:12:35.469
Flying Doctor calling Wollumboola base.

01:12:46.446 --> 01:12:48.278
"Dear, Adrian and Veronica.

01:12:50.751 --> 01:12:53.386
Hello, bitch, and welcome to this letter.

01:13:02.496 --> 01:13:04.890
A letter to you both to wish you much joy.

01:13:04.965 --> 01:13:07.393
You certainly deserve one another.

01:13:13.974 --> 01:13:18.605
Indeed, I hope you get so involved that
the mutual damage will be permanent.

01:13:22.115 --> 01:13:24.076
Part of me hopes you'll have a child

01:13:24.151 --> 01:13:26.411
because I'm a great believer
in time's revenge.

01:13:26.486 --> 01:13:29.115
Yay unto the next generation, and all that.

01:13:30.224 --> 01:13:33.050
But in fairness,
it would perhaps be somewhat unjust

01:13:33.126 --> 01:13:36.957
to inflict such ill will
on the fruit of your poisonous loins.

01:13:43.670 --> 01:13:46.398
Adrian, if she hasn't
let you go all the way yet,

01:13:46.473 --> 01:13:47.998
I suggest you break up with her.

01:13:48.075 --> 01:13:50.235
And no doubt she'll be round
your place as quick as a flash

01:13:50.310 --> 01:13:53.874
with sodden knickers and a three-pack,
eager to give it away.

01:14:00.220 --> 01:14:03.088
Certainly, it worked for yours truly.

01:14:04.391 --> 01:14:07.219
Veronica is undoubtedly
someone who will manipulate you.

01:14:07.294 --> 01:14:10.025
Even her own mother warned me against her.

01:14:12.232 --> 01:14:15.134
In fact, if I were you,
I'd check things out with Mum."

01:14:18.705 --> 01:14:19.695
Tony?

01:14:21.642 --> 01:14:22.734
- Where is she?
- It's all right.

01:14:22.809 --> 01:14:24.801
She's all right. She's fine.

01:14:24.878 --> 01:14:26.676
She's through here.

01:14:47.601 --> 01:14:49.570
So what was the problem?

01:14:51.805 --> 01:14:54.240
It's fine. It's a false alarm.

01:14:54.975 --> 01:14:56.603
I don't understand.

01:14:58.145 --> 01:15:01.274
- No one's expecting you to.
- Give me some credit.

01:15:08.386 --> 01:15:09.584
Stop the car.

01:15:10.324 --> 01:15:13.085
- Stop the car.
- All right.

01:15:13.160 --> 01:15:14.319
- She's feeling sick.
- Okay.

01:15:14.394 --> 01:15:15.692
Stop the car.

01:15:26.707 --> 01:15:28.767
Good girl. Good girl.

01:15:30.143 --> 01:15:31.875
Get it all out.

01:15:45.926 --> 01:15:48.418
- How is she?
- She's fine.

01:15:54.468 --> 01:15:56.266
Do you need a lift home?

01:15:57.036 --> 01:15:58.862
I think I'm gonna stay.

01:16:00.407 --> 01:16:04.310
- Do you think I should stay, too?
- That's completely up to you.

01:16:11.251 --> 01:16:13.311
I met Veronica.

01:16:14.688 --> 01:16:16.714
Well, congratulations.

01:16:18.959 --> 01:16:21.153
Would you believe it, she's hardly changed.

01:16:21.228 --> 01:16:24.392
Still has the same extraordinary coldness.

01:16:26.933 --> 01:16:28.492
- Here.
- What?

01:16:28.568 --> 01:16:30.028
To mop up the drool.

01:16:30.103 --> 01:16:31.366
Ah.

01:16:34.441 --> 01:16:37.809
- I want to show you something.
- What?

01:16:38.912 --> 01:16:40.471
- What's that?
- Open it.

01:16:56.563 --> 01:16:58.429
This is horrible.

01:17:06.773 --> 01:17:08.332
Did you write this?

01:17:08.408 --> 01:17:09.933
She gave it to me, and then she left.

01:17:10.010 --> 01:17:12.671
- But I followed her.
- You did what?

01:17:12.746 --> 01:17:14.738
I don't mean followed followed,

01:17:14.815 --> 01:17:17.148
- but she set off before...
- This her car license number?

01:17:18.618 --> 01:17:19.608
Yes, but, wait, listen.

01:17:19.686 --> 01:17:20.912
All I wanted to do was establish...

01:17:20.987 --> 01:17:24.416
Following someone home and casually
jotting down their car license number

01:17:24.491 --> 01:17:25.851
is tantamount to stalking.

01:17:25.926 --> 01:17:28.754
- Oh, Margaret, come on.
- No, I'm perfectly serious.

01:17:28.829 --> 01:17:32.221
Seems to me you're a hair's breadth
away from a restraining order.

01:17:32.299 --> 01:17:34.825
- I wanted to apologize.
- No, you didn't.

01:17:34.901 --> 01:17:38.797
You wanted to hear her say how wonderful
you are and how you haven't changed.

01:17:38.872 --> 01:17:43.574
And how she's thought of you all these years,
and looked up at the stars and wondered...

01:17:45.245 --> 01:17:47.706
I'm sorry, it's all a bit pathetic.

01:17:47.781 --> 01:17:49.408
Don't hold back, will you?

01:17:49.483 --> 01:17:51.816
Do you know what really strikes me is...

01:17:52.519 --> 01:17:56.012
your total inability to see
what's right under your nose.

01:17:56.089 --> 01:17:57.079
Such as?

01:17:58.558 --> 01:18:02.755
Such as your daughter, who happens to be
lying next door going out of her mind.

01:18:03.329 --> 01:18:05.560
You said she was fine.

01:18:08.201 --> 01:18:10.102
You're on your own now.

01:18:27.287 --> 01:18:30.121
# Just remember I'll still be around #

01:18:31.858 --> 01:18:33.884
# And I know, I know #

01:18:33.960 --> 01:18:36.755
# Like I told you so many times before #

01:18:36.830 --> 01:18:38.389
# You're gonna come back #

01:18:38.465 --> 01:18:40.358
# Yes, you're gonna come back a-knocking #

01:18:40.433 --> 01:18:44.427
# Knocking on my door, yeah, yeah, yeah #

01:18:44.504 --> 01:18:47.299
# Time #

01:18:47.374 --> 01:18:50.635
# Is on my side, yes, it is #

01:18:50.710 --> 01:18:52.070
Oh, my God, no.

01:18:52.145 --> 01:18:53.636
# Time... #

01:18:53.713 --> 01:18:55.173
- Come on.
- No.

01:18:55.248 --> 01:18:57.308
- Come on.
- Tony, I don't dance.

01:18:57.384 --> 01:18:58.545
# Yes, it is... #

01:19:00.453 --> 01:19:01.580
It's good for the soul.

01:19:03.490 --> 01:19:07.285
# Kind that you need #

01:19:07.360 --> 01:19:09.886
# That's why I know #

01:19:09.963 --> 01:19:12.364
# There's gonna be the same feeling #

01:19:12.999 --> 01:19:15.559
# I'm not gonna have to worry no more #

01:19:16.937 --> 01:19:19.998
# All of my worries will be over #

01:19:55.141 --> 01:19:57.035
Might rain later.

01:19:57.110 --> 01:19:59.341
Mm, there's always a later.

01:20:40.687 --> 01:20:42.553
Hey, hey, that's enough.

01:20:43.490 --> 01:20:46.722
I said that's enough. Friday's pub night.

01:20:47.727 --> 01:20:50.754
- Take me to the pub!
- Hey, Graham, I'm watching you.

01:20:50.830 --> 01:20:51.889
All right.

01:20:57.170 --> 01:20:59.230
Come on, let's all make it across.

01:20:59.305 --> 01:21:01.137
We'll make the pub in one piece.

01:21:03.076 --> 01:21:06.137
Here we are, guys. Do a little headcount.

01:21:16.022 --> 01:21:18.184
Are you all looking forward to your beers?

01:21:20.660 --> 01:21:22.887
Okay. Well, I'm gonna be leaving you.

01:21:22.962 --> 01:21:25.657
- Are you going?
- And I'll see you next week.

01:21:25.732 --> 01:21:26.791
- All right?
- Bye.

01:21:28.568 --> 01:21:29.861
- See you next week.
- See ya.

01:21:29.936 --> 01:21:31.529
Bye-bye, Veronica.

01:21:31.604 --> 01:21:32.594
Lovely to see you.

01:21:32.672 --> 01:21:34.368
Bye-bye.

01:21:56.362 --> 01:21:59.457
- What are you doing?
- Oh, hi.

01:21:59.532 --> 01:22:01.426
I saw you and, uh...

01:22:01.501 --> 01:22:04.729
- Saw me and what?
- I was... I was passing through,

01:22:04.804 --> 01:22:06.965
and I saw you, and I thought,
well, now's the chance to...

01:22:07.040 --> 01:22:11.202
- I don't want you following me.
- I wasn't following you.

01:22:11.277 --> 01:22:13.769
You were running after me.

01:22:13.847 --> 01:22:16.214
Jogging, maybe.

01:22:18.251 --> 01:22:21.779
- What'd you want?
- When I read that letter...

01:22:21.855 --> 01:22:24.649
It wasn't intended
as a start to a conversation.

01:22:24.724 --> 01:22:27.185
Nonetheless, let me at least buy you a drink.

01:22:27.260 --> 01:22:30.287
Let me buy you a drink, and you'll
never have to see me again, ever.

01:22:34.067 --> 01:22:35.326
What is this?

01:22:35.401 --> 01:22:37.729
- Those are my details, uh, email...
- No, I have your details.

01:22:37.804 --> 01:22:41.798
- What is it that you do?
- I have a shop,

01:22:41.875 --> 01:22:44.902
albeit a very, very,
very small shop, selling cameras.

01:22:44.978 --> 01:22:47.379
Rare, second-hand cameras. Leicas.

01:22:49.616 --> 01:22:51.076
Make a living?

01:22:51.151 --> 01:22:52.944
Yes, well, depends what you call a living.

01:22:53.019 --> 01:22:54.846
I'm retired, so...

01:22:54.921 --> 01:22:57.582
So, coffee or drink?

01:22:57.657 --> 01:23:00.252
Is this about "closing the circle"?

01:23:01.127 --> 01:23:04.120
Don't know about that.
But it can't hurt, can it?

01:23:07.600 --> 01:23:10.126
I'm not available at the moment to go
and have a drink with you.

01:23:10.203 --> 01:23:11.262
Okay.

01:23:13.573 --> 01:23:15.166
But perhaps at some point.

01:23:16.075 --> 01:23:17.802
Great.

01:23:17.877 --> 01:23:20.708
Fantastic. Eh, whenever suits.

01:24:15.702 --> 01:24:18.062
Okay, who loves "The Simpsons"?

01:24:18.137 --> 01:24:20.765
Me, me.

01:24:20.840 --> 01:24:23.001
"Downton's Abbey"?

01:24:23.076 --> 01:24:26.173
I've never...
I don't watch "Downton's Abbey."

01:24:31.317 --> 01:24:33.479
- I'm going to go to the toilet.
- Okay.

01:24:47.767 --> 01:24:51.966
- She works on... she works...
- I don't know.

01:25:06.352 --> 01:25:07.645
No, she's not.

01:25:07.720 --> 01:25:09.814
- What was her name again?
- I don't know.

01:25:09.889 --> 01:25:11.380
- Yes, you do.
- No, I don't.

01:25:11.457 --> 01:25:12.817
You do know her name.

01:25:12.892 --> 01:25:14.520
Like your badges.

01:25:15.161 --> 01:25:16.151
Yeah.

01:25:16.229 --> 01:25:18.357
Amazing array. Can I have a look?

01:25:21.334 --> 01:25:22.825
Ah, they're brilliant.

01:25:23.703 --> 01:25:25.563
I'm a Stones fan myself.

01:25:25.638 --> 01:25:27.098
Do you wanna tell him
where you get them from?

01:25:27.173 --> 01:25:28.766
Yeah, where do you get them?

01:25:30.143 --> 01:25:32.009
Do you have a favorite in particular?

01:25:36.115 --> 01:25:37.475
- This one?
- Yeah?

01:25:37.550 --> 01:25:38.643
- It is...
- I think.

01:25:38.718 --> 01:25:40.678
- Yeah, it was very expensive, wasn't it?
- Brilliant.

01:25:40.753 --> 01:25:43.154
You bought that one the other day,
didn't you, Adrian?

01:25:49.862 --> 01:25:52.724
Nice meeting you, Adrian.

01:25:52.799 --> 01:25:55.359
They're brilliant. Really brilliant.

01:25:56.836 --> 01:25:58.563
- Have a good day.
- And you.

01:25:58.638 --> 01:25:59.731
Come on.

01:26:02.275 --> 01:26:05.006
Take Dobson's suicide, sir.

01:26:09.082 --> 01:26:11.608
We are told Dobson came to take his own life,

01:26:11.684 --> 01:26:14.085
perhaps when he understood
his girlfriend was pregnant.

01:26:20.360 --> 01:26:22.320
"Indeed, I hope you get so involved

01:26:22.395 --> 01:26:25.422
that the mutual damage will be permanent.

01:26:25.498 --> 01:26:27.558
Part of me hopes you'll have a child

01:26:27.633 --> 01:26:30.535
because I'm a great believer
in time's revenge."

01:27:23.523 --> 01:27:25.950
What are you reading?

01:27:26.025 --> 01:27:27.755
Zweig.

01:27:28.361 --> 01:27:30.621
So you've worked your way
right through the alphabet, have you?

01:27:30.696 --> 01:27:33.291
Can't be anyone left after him.

01:27:37.036 --> 01:27:40.029
Are you, uh, married, I take it?

01:27:40.106 --> 01:27:42.632
- Not married.
- Never?

01:27:45.111 --> 01:27:47.637
Mysterious to a fault.

01:27:47.713 --> 01:27:50.273
I'm divorced, by the way.
In case you were wondering.

01:27:50.349 --> 01:27:52.710
I wasn't, but...

01:27:52.785 --> 01:27:55.046
- I'm sorry to hear that.
- On the contrary.

01:27:55.121 --> 01:27:57.315
Very happily so.

01:27:57.390 --> 01:27:58.983
Best decision we ever undertook.

01:27:59.058 --> 01:28:00.752
In fact, she...

01:28:00.827 --> 01:28:03.454
Margaret recently accused me

01:28:03.529 --> 01:28:06.431
of having built a shrine to you no less.

01:28:08.434 --> 01:28:09.794
The shop.

01:28:09.869 --> 01:28:13.135
When I told her that it was you
who gave me my first Leica.

01:28:16.008 --> 01:28:17.840
And what did you say?

01:28:23.349 --> 01:28:24.647
Ah!

01:28:27.019 --> 01:28:28.282
Hi, Tony.

01:28:29.922 --> 01:28:31.849
Those two are...

01:28:31.924 --> 01:28:34.826
in my daughter's NCT group.

01:28:35.928 --> 01:28:37.722
Lesbians, pregnant lesbians.

01:28:37.797 --> 01:28:39.590
Good God.

01:28:39.665 --> 01:28:41.725
Whatever will they all think of next?

01:28:44.971 --> 01:28:47.463
My daughter's 36, by the way.

01:28:48.674 --> 01:28:50.199
Apart from coming off the rails somewhat

01:28:50.276 --> 01:28:53.938
and deciding to have a child
all on her very own,

01:28:54.013 --> 01:28:56.407
she works in PR.

01:28:56.482 --> 01:28:59.213
Whatever that may mean.

01:29:02.955 --> 01:29:04.115
Thanks for the tea, Tony.

01:29:04.190 --> 01:29:06.551
I... I have to leave, I have an appointment.

01:29:06.626 --> 01:29:10.054
- Are you... Did I say...
- No, finish your cake.

01:29:10.129 --> 01:29:11.789
Is this because I've been
banging on about myself?

01:29:11.864 --> 01:29:13.856
- 'Cause I don't mean to.
- No.

01:29:15.268 --> 01:29:16.928
Uh, the other day...

01:29:17.003 --> 01:29:18.835
after we met, I went to that pub.

01:29:19.405 --> 01:29:21.431
I met Adrian.

01:29:23.543 --> 01:29:26.237
Both Adrian and you are very important to me.

01:29:26.312 --> 01:29:30.541
And all I can say is that
abhorrent letter of mine

01:29:30.616 --> 01:29:33.478
was the expression of a moment.

01:29:33.553 --> 01:29:36.814
And it was deeply shocking
for me to read after all these years.

01:29:36.889 --> 01:29:39.350
- Do we really need to do this?
- If I may, though.

01:29:39.425 --> 01:29:43.087
I'm not expecting you to hand over
Adrian's diary anymore.

01:29:43.162 --> 01:29:45.222
If you've burnt it, that's the end of it.

01:29:45.298 --> 01:29:50.002
And if not, as it was written by the father
of your son, it belongs to you.

01:29:54.140 --> 01:29:56.300
- Enough.
- I can only imagine

01:29:56.375 --> 01:29:57.835
how difficult it's been for you.

01:29:57.910 --> 01:30:00.937
No, you cannot imagine.

01:30:02.715 --> 01:30:05.207
No. Right. Yes.

01:30:29.475 --> 01:30:31.137
Whoops.

01:31:10.850 --> 01:31:12.375
Is that everyone?

01:31:16.122 --> 01:31:17.815
Adrian, are you okay?

01:31:17.890 --> 01:31:19.756
It's that man.

01:31:30.870 --> 01:31:32.896
Yeah, that one I saw, yeah.

01:31:32.972 --> 01:31:34.600
- Over there?
- Yes.

01:31:35.207 --> 01:31:37.267
The one with the bad beard?

01:31:46.619 --> 01:31:48.212
I'll be right back.

01:31:59.265 --> 01:32:00.255
Hello.

01:32:02.802 --> 01:32:04.762
Is there something I can help you with?

01:32:04.837 --> 01:32:07.965
- Do you want a chip?
- No, no, I'm fine.

01:32:08.040 --> 01:32:10.768
On the menu it says
they're fat cut, hand cut.

01:32:10.843 --> 01:32:12.436
But what it really means is they're fat cut.

01:32:12.511 --> 01:32:14.707
They've not actually been cut by hand at all.

01:32:16.315 --> 01:32:18.542
Uh, look, don't take this
the wrong way, but...

01:32:18.617 --> 01:32:20.778
I'll do my best.

01:32:20.853 --> 01:32:22.713
I think, for whatever reason,

01:32:22.788 --> 01:32:25.650
one of the people I look after
is a little uncomfortable

01:32:25.725 --> 01:32:27.485
with you being here.

01:32:27.560 --> 01:32:31.122
- Again.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

01:32:31.197 --> 01:32:32.923
I didn't mean to upset anyone. I'll leave.

01:32:32.998 --> 01:32:35.558
If you don't mind, can I ask who you are?

01:32:35.634 --> 01:32:37.694
- Tony Webster.
- Uh, Ben.

01:32:37.770 --> 01:32:39.261
- Do you mind if I sit down, Tony?
- Of course.

01:32:39.338 --> 01:32:40.670
Cheers.

01:32:42.475 --> 01:32:46.003
I was an old friend of Adrian's father,

01:32:46.078 --> 01:32:48.739
and I've recently become
reacquainted with his mother.

01:32:48.814 --> 01:32:51.008
Oh, you'll understand, then.

01:32:51.083 --> 01:32:53.344
She and I were at university together.

01:32:53.419 --> 01:32:55.945
Really? You don't look
old enough to have been at uni

01:32:56.021 --> 01:32:59.014
- with Adrian's mum.
- You're too kind.

01:32:59.091 --> 01:33:01.252
I was rather hoping to
bump into her here, but, uh...

01:33:01.327 --> 01:33:03.721
Wait, wait, sorry. Uh, bump into who?

01:33:03.796 --> 01:33:05.992
Veronica. Adrian's mother.

01:33:07.666 --> 01:33:09.157
Um...

01:33:09.235 --> 01:33:11.829
you understand I can't discuss
our clients' histories,

01:33:11.904 --> 01:33:13.130
it's a matter of confidentiality.

01:33:13.205 --> 01:33:14.999
- Yeah, of course.
- Um...

01:33:15.074 --> 01:33:17.168
Now, if you are a friend of the family,
what you're saying, Tony,

01:33:17.243 --> 01:33:19.178
doesn't make any sense.

01:33:19.345 --> 01:33:21.211
Veronica is Adrian's sister.

01:33:24.083 --> 01:33:27.383
Um, their mother, Sarah,
passed away six months ago.

01:33:37.930 --> 01:33:40.224
- How did he seem?
- Cheerful.

01:33:40.299 --> 01:33:42.825
Happy. Like himself.

01:33:43.369 --> 01:33:44.894
Only more so.

01:33:46.472 --> 01:33:49.169
As we said good-bye,
he told me he was in love.

01:33:59.885 --> 01:34:03.185
You won't let Veronica get away
with too much, will you?

01:34:04.156 --> 01:34:05.522
Sorry?

01:34:06.892 --> 01:34:09.191
Don't let her get away with too much.

01:34:09.895 --> 01:34:11.193
Are we okay?

01:34:13.299 --> 01:34:16.098
They seem very happy, the five of them.

01:34:17.303 --> 01:34:20.330
- You obviously do a good job.
- We try our best.

01:34:22.007 --> 01:34:23.339
Good luck to you all.

01:34:24.910 --> 01:34:26.208
I'm gonna head back to the group.

01:35:06.385 --> 01:35:07.910
Please leave me a message after the beep.

01:35:07.987 --> 01:35:10.013
Margaret, it's me again.

01:35:10.089 --> 01:35:11.282
Yeah, uh, this is it.

01:35:11.357 --> 01:35:13.417
I think this is definitely it. Where are you?

01:35:39.218 --> 01:35:40.644
Tell me about your day.

01:35:40.719 --> 01:35:42.146
My day?

01:35:42.221 --> 01:35:44.582
Yeah. What you did.

01:35:44.657 --> 01:35:47.451
Oh. Okay. I went to Highgate.

01:35:47.526 --> 01:35:49.787
To see a woman who I'd had
a relationship with

01:35:49.862 --> 01:35:51.555
when I was an undergraduate.

01:35:51.630 --> 01:35:53.791
We've recently become reacquainted,

01:35:53.866 --> 01:35:55.698
but she wasn't there.

01:35:56.769 --> 01:35:59.129
- Wasn't where?
- At home.

01:35:59.204 --> 01:36:00.831
So what were you doing there?

01:36:00.906 --> 01:36:03.000
I went to see her.

01:36:03.075 --> 01:36:06.068
- But she wasn't there.
- No.

01:36:06.145 --> 01:36:09.206
I waited around a bit, outside...

01:36:09.281 --> 01:36:10.374
at the station.

01:36:10.449 --> 01:36:13.110
So you're stalking her? You're her stalker.

01:36:13.185 --> 01:36:15.177
- No.
- Yes, you are.

01:36:15.254 --> 01:36:16.580
No. Not at all, no.

01:36:16.655 --> 01:36:18.415
No, moving on.

01:36:18.490 --> 01:36:20.482
We broke up is the point.

01:36:20.559 --> 01:36:23.220
While we were still at university.

01:36:23.295 --> 01:36:26.561
And not long after, she formed
a relationship with my best friend.

01:36:28.400 --> 01:36:32.401
And I wrote them both a very nasty letter.

01:36:34.106 --> 01:36:36.534
And recently, I've been working
under the assumption

01:36:36.609 --> 01:36:41.238
that they'd had a child together shortly
before my best friend committed suicide.

01:36:41.313 --> 01:36:43.373
But now it appears
that the mother of that child

01:36:43.449 --> 01:36:46.476
wasn't my ex-girlfriend,
but it was her mother.

01:36:46.552 --> 01:36:49.680
And I can only assume that it was my...

01:36:49.755 --> 01:36:52.490
horrible letter that
in some way pushed the...

01:36:53.157 --> 01:36:54.626
friend...

01:36:58.297 --> 01:36:59.890
Hello again, Tony.

01:36:59.965 --> 01:37:02.025
- Emma.
- Oh, hi, Emma.

01:37:02.101 --> 01:37:03.660
How we doing?

01:37:03.736 --> 01:37:06.564
I'd say holding up, just about.

01:37:06.639 --> 01:37:09.003
I'll just check baby's head.

01:37:09.875 --> 01:37:12.003
No, no, no. Dad, stay.

01:37:12.611 --> 01:37:13.977
Just for a bit.

01:37:16.181 --> 01:37:17.672
You can hold my hand.

01:37:29.061 --> 01:37:31.188
What's going on?

01:37:31.263 --> 01:37:34.165
- I don't know what's going on.
- Everything's fine.

01:37:38.604 --> 01:37:40.764
Dad, why isn't anyone saying anything?

01:37:40.839 --> 01:37:42.566
Everything's absolutely fine.

01:37:42.641 --> 01:37:44.667
We're nearly there, I promise you.

01:37:50.916 --> 01:37:53.043
Susie, you have a baby.

01:37:53.118 --> 01:37:54.518
Congratulations.

01:38:04.730 --> 01:38:06.562
Why isn't he crying?

01:38:07.633 --> 01:38:09.124
He's not crying.

01:38:10.803 --> 01:38:12.294
- Can you see anything?
- He's fine. He's fine.

01:38:12.371 --> 01:38:13.464
Why isn't he crying?

01:38:13.539 --> 01:38:16.669
Excuse me, my daughter's asking,
why isn't her son crying?

01:38:31.557 --> 01:38:33.583
So proud of you.

01:38:40.199 --> 01:38:42.361
- I wanna see him.
- Yeah.

01:38:46.405 --> 01:38:49.033
- Baby.
- Ah, look.

01:38:49.108 --> 01:38:51.234
Say hello to your mummy.

01:38:51.309 --> 01:38:53.037
There he is.

01:39:03.722 --> 01:39:05.748
- It's very hot.
- Thank you.

01:39:17.569 --> 01:39:20.230
You don't have to stay here, you know.

01:39:20.305 --> 01:39:21.637
I want to.

01:39:27.579 --> 01:39:30.708
Susie said you dealt
with everything very impressively.

01:39:31.650 --> 01:39:35.109
I'm not an entirely redundant
member of this family, yet.

01:39:36.188 --> 01:39:39.215
- I've never said you were.
- Haven't you?

01:39:44.730 --> 01:39:46.523
Where are you going?

01:39:46.598 --> 01:39:48.325
I'm gonna give you some space.

01:39:48.400 --> 01:39:50.198
Fine. But, uh...

01:39:51.236 --> 01:39:53.597
you may be interested to know,
you probably won't,

01:39:53.672 --> 01:39:56.733
but I was planning on
making an apology to you.

01:39:58.243 --> 01:40:00.504
For being insensitive, being a bore,

01:40:00.579 --> 01:40:02.946
for being a monumental pain in the arse.

01:40:04.783 --> 01:40:07.548
Maybe it's too little too late,
but I hope not.

01:40:08.887 --> 01:40:12.683
I know, technically, we're not
supposed to make pronouncements

01:40:12.758 --> 01:40:14.886
of this nature anymore, but...

01:40:15.861 --> 01:40:19.628
you and Susie are the two
most important people in my life.

01:40:22.100 --> 01:40:25.161
Divorced, married, makes no difference.

01:40:30.509 --> 01:40:32.444
Well, there you are.

01:40:35.814 --> 01:40:37.715
Despite what you might think...

01:40:39.685 --> 01:40:42.587
I assure you, I'm trying.

01:40:49.261 --> 01:40:51.287
What's wrong with your watch?

01:40:52.798 --> 01:40:54.460
It's stopped.

01:41:25.597 --> 01:41:27.861
Come on, baby.

01:41:31.336 --> 01:41:32.563
Get you home.

01:41:32.638 --> 01:41:34.213
Leaving.

01:41:35.107 --> 01:41:37.133
Leaving hospital.

01:41:41.413 --> 01:41:44.906
How often do we tell our own life story?

01:41:44.983 --> 01:41:49.713
How often do we adjust,
embellish, make sly cuts?

01:41:49.788 --> 01:41:51.949
And the longer life goes on,

01:41:52.024 --> 01:41:56.153
the fewer are those around
to tell us our life is not our life.

01:41:56.228 --> 01:41:59.164
It is just a story
we've told about our lives.

01:42:00.465 --> 01:42:03.060
A story about our lives told to others,

01:42:03.135 --> 01:42:05.798
but mainly to ourselves.

01:42:07.673 --> 01:42:09.301
Oh, hello. How are you?

01:42:10.075 --> 01:42:11.869
- Uh, what?
- Are you well?

01:42:11.944 --> 01:42:14.243
- I'm fine.
- Want a coffee?

01:42:14.846 --> 01:42:15.836
Yeah.

01:42:25.123 --> 01:42:26.483
Thank you.

01:42:26.558 --> 01:42:30.058
Could you, um... could you sign
here, please? I just got...

01:42:34.232 --> 01:42:35.791
Thank you.

01:42:37.269 --> 01:42:39.363
Great, thank you.

01:42:39.438 --> 01:42:40.963
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

01:42:53.418 --> 01:42:57.480
"I've been turning over in my mind
the question of nostalgia,

01:42:57.556 --> 01:42:59.787
and whether I suffer from it.

01:43:01.426 --> 01:43:03.554
I suppose I am nostalgic.

01:43:04.663 --> 01:43:06.757
I think of my time with Margaret

01:43:06.832 --> 01:43:09.358
and Susie's birth and her first years.

01:43:10.569 --> 01:43:12.895
A bunch of kids in school.

01:43:16.308 --> 01:43:18.709
A girl dancing for once in her life.

01:43:21.980 --> 01:43:26.350
A secret horizontal gesture
beneath a sunlit wisteria.

01:43:30.389 --> 01:43:33.382
I think of Adrian's definition of history.

01:43:40.032 --> 01:43:43.002
I think of everything
that has happened in my life...

01:43:44.002 --> 01:43:46.562
and how little I have allowed to happen.

01:43:47.172 --> 01:43:49.869
I, who neither won nor lost.

01:43:50.742 --> 01:43:55.777
Who avoided being hurt
and called it a capacity for survival.

01:44:01.586 --> 01:44:04.815
I think of how our lives got entwined

01:44:04.890 --> 01:44:07.684
and went along together for a time.

01:44:07.759 --> 01:44:10.087
And when I look back,

01:44:10.162 --> 01:44:12.927
now, on that time, however brief...

01:44:14.633 --> 01:44:17.831
I am moved more than I thought possible.

01:44:19.604 --> 01:44:23.500
Indeed, I'm sorry that I have known
nothing of your life in the years since.

01:44:24.543 --> 01:44:27.809
No doubt you could have taught
this old fool a thing or two.

01:44:33.418 --> 01:44:35.410
Perhaps, in a way, you have."

01:44:48.100 --> 01:44:49.926
- Hello.
- Surprise!

01:44:50.001 --> 01:44:51.230
Lovely surprise.

01:44:52.571 --> 01:44:53.964
Hello, Joshua.

01:44:54.039 --> 01:44:56.366
- Say hello to "The Mudge."
- Hello, Mudge.

01:44:56.441 --> 01:44:59.001
No, you are The Mudge. Mum and I decided.

01:44:59.077 --> 01:45:01.302
On account of your being a curmudgeon.

01:45:01.679 --> 01:45:03.073
How are you?

01:45:03.148 --> 01:45:04.138
Good.

01:45:04.216 --> 01:45:06.576
The NCT group send their love to you.

01:45:06.651 --> 01:45:08.045
Oh, that's nice.

01:45:08.120 --> 01:45:12.148
We had a lovely lunch comparing
the damage done to our bodies.

01:45:12.224 --> 01:45:14.918
- Vaginas and all.
- Oh, Joshua, cover your ears.

01:45:14.993 --> 01:45:16.256
Cover your ears.

01:45:19.564 --> 01:45:21.157
Very good.

01:45:23.702 --> 01:45:25.500
You're a special young man.
