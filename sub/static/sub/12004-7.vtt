00:00.200 --> 00:01.712
Previously on Switched at birth...

00:01.774 --> 00:04.689
I thought you might like to know
that this Bruce is

00:05.174 --> 00:06.174
quite a player.

00:07.261 --> 00:08.261
"Love songs for Regina."

00:08.536 --> 00:10.210
It's Daphne's birth certificate.

00:10.429 --> 00:11.561
"Angelo Sorrento."

00:12.002 --> 00:13.355
Angelo Sorrento's my dad.

00:13.425 --> 00:15.420
I'm Angelo Sorrento's daughter.

00:16.260 --> 00:18.450
The hospital just withdrew their offer.

00:18.491 --> 00:19.813
They want to go to trial.

00:19.867 --> 00:21.910
- Why would they do that?
- They found something.

00:22.030 --> 00:24.349
Something that they can use against us.

00:24.350 --> 00:26.490
Full house, queens over eights.

00:26.750 --> 00:28.530
Hey, I'll add it to your tab.

00:28.690 --> 00:31.250
- We're stealing a test.
- Are you wussing out on me?

00:31.430 --> 00:33.419
If you had my 10 grand,
you wouldn't have to do this,

00:33.420 --> 00:34.540
but you don't.

00:41.950 --> 00:43.699
Toby, if you take the last lemon square,

00:43.700 --> 00:45.960
I will shave off your
eyebrows in your sleep.

00:46.340 --> 00:48.830
- Halfsies?
- Then I'll just shave one.

00:55.390 --> 00:56.970
Daphne, look.

01:00.580 --> 01:02.590
- Are you asking me to make coffee?
- Yes.

01:04.120 --> 01:06.650
- No?
- Close.

01:06.890 --> 01:09.190
This is "Make coffee."

01:09.750 --> 01:11.499
What was I saying?

01:11.500 --> 01:14.340
- You're asking me to make out.
- Oh, okay.

01:14.690 --> 01:15.809
There's a couple girls

01:15.810 --> 01:17.429
at school I'd like to make some coffee with.

01:17.430 --> 01:20.070
- Just make sure you use a coffee filter.
- Oh!

01:20.950 --> 01:22.959
What's this about a stolen test?

01:22.960 --> 01:24.799
- What test?
- Kathryn, did you get this e-mail?

01:24.800 --> 01:26.889
Kathryn: - No.
- A chemistry test was stolen

01:26.890 --> 01:29.069
- off some teacher's desk.
- Seriously?

01:29.070 --> 01:30.209
Do they know who did it?

01:30.210 --> 01:33.379
Appaently whoever stole it, sold it
other kids for a lot of money.

01:33.380 --> 01:34.709
How much did they pay?

01:34.710 --> 01:36.679
- Does that really matter?
- Just curious.

01:36.680 --> 01:38.449
Toby, you were studying for a chem test,

01:38.450 --> 01:39.809
- weren't you?
- Yeah, that was yesterday.

01:39.810 --> 01:43.029
It says here we're supposed to
talk to our kids about cheating.

01:43.030 --> 01:46.479
- Cheating bad, studying good.
- Good talk, mom.

01:46.480 --> 01:49.709
The principal is giving everyone
24 hours to come forward

01:49.710 --> 01:52.599
- and be suspended.
- Oh, that's an incentive.

01:52.600 --> 01:54.430
It is when the other option is expulsion.

01:55.040 --> 01:56.340
I'm going upstairs.

01:57.160 --> 01:58.199
Yeah, me too.

01:58.200 --> 01:59.589
Hey, Daphne, wanna teach

01:59.590 --> 02:02.090
me how to sign more dirty words upstairs?

02:02.090 --> 02:03.050
Sure.

02:04.790 --> 02:06.949
Honey, I just mixed up my signs.

02:06.950 --> 02:09.080
I asked our daughter to make out.

02:10.389 --> 02:11.920
I'll make out with you.

02:13.570 --> 02:15.300
You stole the test?

02:15.640 --> 02:16.820
What are you talking about?

02:17.230 --> 02:18.899
Last week you accosted me for money,

02:18.900 --> 02:22.219
and then I saw you talking all
conspiratorial-like to Wilke.

02:22.220 --> 02:24.609
That's a pretty big leap to
assume that I stole the test.

02:24.610 --> 02:25.999
- You stole the test?
- Hey,

02:26.000 --> 02:27.519
Daphne, why don't you speak a little louder?

02:27.520 --> 02:29.379
I don't think they can
hear you in East Riverside.

02:29.380 --> 02:32.239
Oh, wow wow wow wow!

02:32.240 --> 02:33.370
You did it.

02:34.210 --> 02:35.659
I owed Wilke a lot of money,

02:35.660 --> 02:37.490
money that we earned selling the test.

02:37.560 --> 02:39.049
Now I don't owe Wilke money anymore.

02:39.050 --> 02:41.449
Oh, that's great.
That shows real initiative.

02:41.450 --> 02:44.509
You gonna open with that when
you tell dad you're suspended?

02:44.510 --> 02:45.699
I'm not getting suspended.

02:45.700 --> 02:47.169
You're not confessing to the principal?

02:47.170 --> 02:49.359
No way. He's bluffing.
He has no idea who did it.

02:49.360 --> 02:51.049
Toby, if he didn't know anything,

02:51.050 --> 02:52.479
he wouldn't have sent the e-mail.

02:52.480 --> 02:54.140
Come on, don't be stupid.

02:54.180 --> 02:55.519
I got this, okay?

02:55.520 --> 02:57.740
If you get expelled,
you can kiss college goodbye.

02:57.910 --> 03:01.330
You and Adriana can be roomies in
the guest house till you're 35.

03:03.360 --> 03:05.469
- What are we gonna do?
- Do?

03:05.470 --> 03:07.699
Oh, we're not gonna do anything.

03:07.700 --> 03:10.660
Whatever Toby did, it's done.

03:12.000 --> 03:18.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:30.260 --> 03:32.719
You know, staring at that phone's
not gonna make it ring.

03:32.720 --> 03:35.319
Dale's my only contact
on the hospital board,

03:35.320 --> 03:37.799
and he is not returning my phone calls.

03:37.800 --> 03:39.550
How many times have you called him?

03:40.660 --> 03:41.620
Eight.

03:42.230 --> 03:44.619
No wonder the hospital withdrew their offer.

03:44.620 --> 03:45.949
You're a phone stalker.

03:45.950 --> 03:48.509
You know, if the hospital board's
dug up some deep dark secret

03:48.510 --> 03:51.040
on the Kennish family,
I would like to know what that is.

03:51.290 --> 03:52.770
Okay, what could it be?

03:52.770 --> 03:56.749
I shoplifted once when I was 12,

03:56.750 --> 03:59.350
and I fall asleep when I'm at church.

03:59.590 --> 04:01.280
And you're sure it's nothing bigger?

04:02.180 --> 04:04.959
- What about you? Are you sure?
- What?

04:04.960 --> 04:09.150
- Any dark secrets that I should know about?
- None that you should know about.

04:09.190 --> 04:12.459
You realize that doesn't sound
as reassuring as you thought it would.

04:12.460 --> 04:14.569
You know what I cannot believe?
I cannot believe we are walking

04:14.570 --> 04:17.959
into a courtroom I have no idea what
that board's gonna throw at us.

04:19.630 --> 04:21.050
I hate this.

04:21.200 --> 04:23.800
This lawsuit is not only
making me doubt you,

04:23.900 --> 04:26.050
it's making me doubt myself.

04:26.810 --> 04:28.219
What are you doing?

04:28.220 --> 04:30.390
I'm calling Dale.
Maybe he'll pick up my call.

04:43.020 --> 04:44.140
What?

04:45.570 --> 04:48.720
I think you should tell the principal
about stealing the test.

04:48.890 --> 04:50.119
Yeah, got it, thanks.

04:50.120 --> 04:52.190
I'm just trying to help, but don't know how.

04:52.500 --> 04:55.040
I'm sorry. I've never been
in a situation like this.

04:55.170 --> 04:56.440
You think I have?

04:58.060 --> 04:59.630
I meant with a brother.

05:01.330 --> 05:03.440
Yeah, great example I'm setting for you.

05:04.730 --> 05:06.119
I didn't mean to drag you into this.

05:06.120 --> 05:07.870
I should have never taken you to poker.

05:08.260 --> 05:09.849
I'm just worried about you.

05:09.850 --> 05:12.939
Well, don't. Wilke and I
will figure something out.

05:12.940 --> 05:14.160
It's all gonna be fine.

05:16.860 --> 05:19.329
So word is Anna Mastro caught her daughter

05:19.330 --> 05:21.809
- with a stolen copy of the test.
- Clover?

05:21.810 --> 05:24.409
- She bought one?
- Mm-hmm, paid a thousand dollars.

05:24.410 --> 05:26.549
Okay, a thousand dollars for a test.

05:26.550 --> 05:29.170
Have you met Clover?
It was money well spent.

05:29.550 --> 05:30.869
Not if she's expelled.

05:30.870 --> 05:33.249
Oh, lord, what if Chad
and James got expelled

05:33.250 --> 05:36.360
and ended up home all the time?

05:36.780 --> 05:38.669
Though it is something
else I could blame on Bruce

05:38.670 --> 05:39.960
and the divorce.

05:41.700 --> 05:42.720
What?

05:43.260 --> 05:44.660
I didn't say anything.

05:45.680 --> 05:47.280
Is she still seeing him?

05:47.710 --> 05:50.010
Regina? I have no idea.

05:51.230 --> 05:52.760
You don't talk about it?

05:53.280 --> 05:57.040
You know, she knows how I feel about Bruce.

06:04.230 --> 06:06.390
So what else does Kathryn say about me?

06:07.220 --> 06:09.960
- I should not be telling you this.
- No, come on.

06:09.980 --> 06:13.939
So I'm a player, a cheat, a liar.

06:13.940 --> 06:16.549
Did she tell you I like
to kick puppies, too?

06:16.550 --> 06:18.559
I don't care what Kathryn thinks,

06:18.560 --> 06:20.450
and I am not a dog person.

06:21.400 --> 06:23.739
I just want to know how bad
the stories have to get

06:23.740 --> 06:25.270
before you dump me.

06:26.340 --> 06:27.649
Considering our relationship

06:27.650 --> 06:30.170
doesn't extend outside dark restaurants

06:30.180 --> 06:33.510
and this bedroom, I'd say pretty bad.

06:33.580 --> 06:36.060
No no no, stay, stay, stay, don't go.

06:36.530 --> 06:37.719
Is this the part where you

06:37.720 --> 06:39.539
pull me back to bed and say "Stay forever"?

06:39.540 --> 06:41.459
And give you another thing
to laugh at me about?

06:41.460 --> 06:44.070
I don't think so. Stay, come on.

06:45.130 --> 06:46.640
I can't do that.

06:47.250 --> 06:48.820
Let's go to your place.

06:49.340 --> 06:51.000
We can't do that, either.

06:51.620 --> 06:52.990
Because of Kathryn.

06:52.990 --> 06:54.730
Because of Daphne.

06:55.970 --> 06:58.790
Pero tu me gusta,

06:58.950 --> 07:00.720
Regina Vasquez.

07:01.200 --> 07:02.250
I do.

07:02.750 --> 07:04.270
I really do.

07:04.750 --> 07:06.730
Okay, okay.

07:08.030 --> 07:09.960
Let me test the waters.

07:10.140 --> 07:11.120
Okay.

07:12.700 --> 07:14.490
Regina Vasquez.

07:25.660 --> 07:26.680
Wait.

07:26.750 --> 07:30.029
I think I found

07:30.030 --> 07:31.330
My dad.

07:32.350 --> 07:33.960
Was that right?

07:34.020 --> 07:35.190
Yeah, yeah.

07:46.450 --> 07:48.359
Yeah, and right age.

07:48.360 --> 07:50.579
He works at a club near East Riverside.

07:50.580 --> 07:53.220
It's gotta be him. And...

07:55.700 --> 07:57.400
We look alike, right?

08:05.770 --> 08:08.910
You're acting excited.
Yay for excited. Me too.

08:12.630 --> 08:14.110
I know that sign.

08:14.880 --> 08:17.099
Tonight. Yeah, he's working tonight.

08:17.100 --> 08:19.360
The club opens at 9:00.

08:23.260 --> 08:24.320
Tonight?

08:31.180 --> 08:33.519
So do I just walk in and say,
"Hey, I'm your daughter,"

08:33.520 --> 08:35.669
"but not the deaf one that
you abandoned all those years ago"?

08:35.669 --> 08:37.900
I mean, what am I supposed to say?

08:39.200 --> 08:41.770
He's gonna think I'm crazy.

08:47.830 --> 08:49.030
You think?

08:50.380 --> 08:51.970
Is that the sign for love?

08:52.620 --> 08:54.140
Oh, how cute.

09:01.300 --> 09:03.150
I didn't know you were coming over.

09:05.650 --> 09:07.509
Actually, I asked him.

09:07.510 --> 09:08.910
Asked him for what?

09:10.640 --> 09:11.599
You remember that picture

09:11.600 --> 09:14.250
you gave me of Regina in front of a car?

09:14.290 --> 09:16.089
Well, you could see the license plate,

09:16.090 --> 09:18.870
and Emmett was helping
me track down the owner.

09:21.690 --> 09:24.419
It was an accident,
we met at Buckner. I saw him.

09:24.420 --> 09:25.309
This is totally my fault.

09:25.310 --> 09:27.360
If you're gonna get mad at anyone,
get mad at me.

09:32.170 --> 09:35.689
I think I found

09:35.690 --> 09:36.760
my dad.

09:39.180 --> 09:42.620
If that matters at all, if you're curious.

09:48.630 --> 09:50.670
Does he look familiar? Is that him?

09:53.810 --> 09:55.110
I have no idea.

09:56.520 --> 09:57.820
Go talk to her.

11:16.417 --> 11:17.798
Regina's not home yet.

11:19.820 --> 11:22.459
- Hello, Kathryn.
- And you just missed Denise.

11:22.460 --> 11:24.080
I never miss Denise.

11:24.580 --> 11:26.879
Do you know what time
Regina usually gets back?

11:26.880 --> 11:28.210
Did you try calling her?

11:28.220 --> 11:29.800
I was hoping to surprise her.

11:29.950 --> 11:33.390
Oh, in my experience,
Regina doesn't like surprises.

11:33.430 --> 11:35.140
Is that a relationship tip?

11:36.120 --> 11:37.710
Would you like to wait inside?

11:38.100 --> 11:40.420
That'd be a little weird.

11:40.920 --> 11:43.600
Can you just do me a favor
and see that she gets this?

11:44.900 --> 11:46.800
At least it's not a thong.

11:47.860 --> 11:49.289
She left it at my house,

11:49.290 --> 11:51.750
and I was hoping to use it
as an excuse to see her.

11:52.300 --> 11:54.570
Well, instead you got me.

11:55.160 --> 11:56.430
Yes, I did.

11:57.840 --> 11:59.850
Tell John I said hello, please.

11:59.960 --> 12:01.100
Will do.

12:07.620 --> 12:11.070
What if Regina's right?
What if he is a jackass?

12:42.970 --> 12:47.300
It's the tape that we
found with Regina's stuff.

12:47.980 --> 12:49.580
It's kind of groovy, right?

12:50.030 --> 12:51.640
Those are animal noises.

12:54.370 --> 12:55.470
Birds.

13:09.210 --> 13:10.770
That's right, get down.

13:54.590 --> 13:56.880
Oh, no no no, don't stop.

13:56.950 --> 13:58.419
I love this song.

13:58.420 --> 14:00.160
I used to dance to it, too.

14:01.180 --> 14:03.319
No no no, keep dancing.

14:03.320 --> 14:05.140
Please, I'll go.

14:06.310 --> 14:07.400
Goodbye.

14:15.590 --> 14:18.129
- Honey, dinner's almost ready.
- Not hungry.

14:18.130 --> 14:21.360
Do you want me to bring you a plate? Toby!

14:27.830 --> 14:31.920
- Is this about your band or a girl?
- No.

14:31.940 --> 14:34.320
- Toby.
- Mom, there's nothing wrong.

14:35.980 --> 14:38.480
Is this about the e-mail
that was sent around?

14:40.550 --> 14:42.710
Do you know who stole that test?

14:43.390 --> 14:44.480
No.

14:45.710 --> 14:47.470
Well, I know something is wrong.

14:47.600 --> 14:49.110
Come on, tell me, Toby.

14:50.880 --> 14:52.700
I can't tell you.

14:57.970 --> 14:59.780
You can tell me anything.

15:04.570 --> 15:06.530
Dad's gonna kill me.

15:11.870 --> 15:13.180
Hey, mom.

15:13.200 --> 15:14.070
Hi.

15:17.540 --> 15:20.390
Did you know that Bay is looking for dad?

15:23.670 --> 15:25.040
She's stubborn.

15:25.510 --> 15:27.740
I'm stubborn. I should have known better.

15:29.440 --> 15:31.200
She thinks she found him.

15:32.720 --> 15:34.000
Are they in touch?

15:34.720 --> 15:35.980
I don't think so.

15:36.330 --> 15:38.649
Well, he's a man who's very good

15:38.650 --> 15:40.000
at staying lost.

15:41.160 --> 15:44.440
Did he leave because I'm deaf?

15:47.440 --> 15:50.139
What? No.

15:50.140 --> 15:54.449
But he left right after I became deaf.

15:54.450 --> 15:56.070
Is that a coincidence?

15:57.100 --> 15:58.930
He left because...

16:00.430 --> 16:01.539
You know what?

16:01.540 --> 16:03.620
I'm not talking about this, okay?

16:04.000 --> 16:05.650
Opinion, please. Hmm?

16:09.640 --> 16:10.890
Like it?

16:13.950 --> 16:16.539
I think I'm starting to like Bruce

16:16.540 --> 16:20.319
and, you know, I was wondering
how you would feel

16:20.320 --> 16:22.370
if he came over for dinner sometime.

16:25.850 --> 16:27.560
I need you to answer me.

16:29.700 --> 16:33.080
He left because he was too weak and scared

16:33.100 --> 16:35.210
to be a part of a real family.

16:36.550 --> 16:37.820
He missed out

16:38.200 --> 16:40.930
on the greatest kid in the world.

16:42.260 --> 16:43.740
And if he saw you,

16:44.910 --> 16:46.350
he would know that.

16:56.990 --> 17:00.090
He's right. I am gonna kill him.

17:00.510 --> 17:02.490
What the hell was he thinking?

17:02.770 --> 17:04.740
He owed Wilke all that money.

17:04.770 --> 17:07.210
Wilke, god. He told me he took care of that.

17:08.280 --> 17:09.759
Wait a minute. You knew about this

17:09.760 --> 17:12.520
and you didn't tell me?

17:12.900 --> 17:14.640
I didn't want you to get upset.

17:14.880 --> 17:16.559
You don't have to protect me.

17:16.560 --> 17:18.479
He's my son, too. What happened?

17:18.480 --> 17:20.388
I offered him money. He didn't take it.

17:20.390 --> 17:23.409
- How did you offer him money?
- I opened my checkbook.

17:23.410 --> 17:25.919
- Did you yell at him?
- No, you know what? And I should have.

17:25.920 --> 17:28.509
What did you say to him to
make him not take the money?

17:28.510 --> 17:30.029
Kathryn, I was not hard on him,

17:30.030 --> 17:31.719
and you know what? I should have been.

17:31.720 --> 17:33.709
I should have brought
the hammer down right there.

17:33.710 --> 17:35.379
'Cause you know what? This kid doesn't think

17:35.380 --> 17:39.210
there are consequences to anything,
because we keep saving him.

17:41.190 --> 17:42.149
Do you think this is 'cause

17:42.150 --> 17:43.940
we've been focusing on the girls so much?

17:47.010 --> 17:48.689
This has nothing to do with the girls.

17:48.690 --> 17:50.509
Even if it were then,
that would not be an excuse.

17:50.510 --> 17:52.180
Okay? Stop letting him off the hook.

17:55.100 --> 17:56.200
I know.

17:58.380 --> 18:00.100
What the hell was he thinking?

18:11.170 --> 18:12.310
Okay.

18:13.670 --> 18:15.070
Okay what?

18:15.220 --> 18:16.750
Okay, I wanna go.

18:19.190 --> 18:23.080
- So what's his name?
- Angelo Sorrento.

18:25.510 --> 18:27.250
You really didn't know his name.

18:30.380 --> 18:32.199
I can't promise to be nice to him.

18:32.200 --> 18:33.660
That is okay with me.

18:34.410 --> 18:36.264
So how are we getting there?

18:36.372 --> 18:38.682
You have a sidecar so we can fit in a third?

18:42.190 --> 18:44.130
Why make a joke die twice? No.

18:44.280 --> 18:46.540
You know what? We'll take Toby's car.

18:51.310 --> 18:53.210
- What did he say?
- He's calling shotgun.

19:03.750 --> 19:06.709
Good thing we skipped dinner because
it would be coming up right about now.

19:06.710 --> 19:08.150
- Are you nervous?
- Aren't you?

19:08.170 --> 19:09.580
No, not really.

19:09.760 --> 19:12.069
Oh, thursdays are latin heat.

19:12.070 --> 19:13.710
You should really tell your grandmother.

19:15.150 --> 19:16.900
So how do we get in?

19:17.560 --> 19:18.910
We could try the door.

19:23.800 --> 19:25.690
And...

19:27.520 --> 19:28.189
Yeah?

19:28.190 --> 19:29.980
Hello, cool sexy bar lady.

19:30.220 --> 19:31.429
We're not open right now.

19:31.430 --> 19:32.550
I'll wait.

19:38.070 --> 19:39.740
I'm not exactly sure.

20:05.760 --> 20:07.360
Lost and found's in the coat check.

20:09.280 --> 20:10.629
Did you say "Left his retainer"?

20:10.630 --> 20:12.030
I'm nervous, okay?

20:24.560 --> 20:26.350
- Hey, dad.
- Not now.

20:28.320 --> 20:30.420
- I wanted to explain.
- Toby,

20:31.090 --> 20:32.620
this is not a good time.

20:36.850 --> 20:38.280
I'm sorry.

20:39.730 --> 20:41.680
I can't even look at you right now.

21:00.710 --> 21:04.249
Here. If you don't find it,
I've got three more boxes back there.

21:04.250 --> 21:07.180
- Could I use your restroom?
- It's through the bar.

21:07.180 --> 21:08.670
Could I take her with me?

21:08.950 --> 21:11.140
- I really don't care.
- Okay.

21:23.290 --> 21:24.980
I don't see him. Do you?

21:28.820 --> 21:30.030
Over there.

21:38.960 --> 21:40.209
Is that him?

21:40.210 --> 21:41.569
I don't know. Is it?

21:41.570 --> 21:43.380
- You've met him.
- I was two.

21:46.380 --> 21:48.730
So what do we do now?

21:50.660 --> 21:51.980
Go talk to him.

21:57.510 --> 21:59.239
This is stupid. We should just go.

21:59.240 --> 22:00.950
What are you talking about? Go talk to him.

22:01.060 --> 22:03.670
I-I can't.

22:05.420 --> 22:06.640
Will you do it?

22:13.210 --> 22:15.119
- Denise.
- I can't believe it.

22:15.120 --> 22:16.479
Chad bought one of those tests.

22:16.480 --> 22:18.099
He split the cost with James.

22:18.100 --> 22:20.080
That's what I get for
teaching my sons to share.

22:20.190 --> 22:22.010
Oh, no. I am so sorry.

22:22.390 --> 22:24.900
I know. You think you know your kids.

22:25.600 --> 22:29.060
- I mean, I'm telling you.
- What do you mean by that?

22:29.240 --> 22:31.269
After everything you've been through,
with the switch thing.

22:31.270 --> 22:32.240
Oh.

22:32.690 --> 22:35.020
Let's take the frustration
out on the tennis courts.

22:35.690 --> 22:38.630
I really don't think so.
I ate dinner already.

22:41.390 --> 22:43.210
Did I leave this here?

22:45.420 --> 22:47.889
- Is that your earring?
- Yeah, it was a gift from my sister.

22:47.890 --> 22:49.369
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

22:49.370 --> 22:50.880
Who else would it belong to?

22:51.440 --> 22:53.659
Do you think you might
have left it at Bruce's

22:53.660 --> 22:54.969
when you were dropping the kids off?

22:54.970 --> 22:56.550
If I left it at Bruce's,

22:56.720 --> 22:59.380
it wasn't because I was
dropping off the kids.

22:59.570 --> 23:02.219
So you and Bruce are getting
back together again?

23:02.220 --> 23:05.159
God, no, but every now and then,

23:05.160 --> 23:07.080
we like to forget we're divorced.

23:08.490 --> 23:10.330
Do you think he told Regina that?

23:10.410 --> 23:13.350
I'm guessing no. It is Bruce, after all.

23:36.100 --> 23:38.120
- Hi.
- Hi.

23:38.770 --> 23:40.790
Are you Angelo Sorrento?

23:41.610 --> 23:42.850
I am.

23:43.200 --> 23:45.820
Do you remember a woman
named Regina Vasquez?

23:46.650 --> 23:48.010
I'm not sure.

23:48.520 --> 23:50.959
You left her, and you left me.

23:50.960 --> 23:53.490
You just took off one day and
we never heard from you again.

23:53.530 --> 23:54.580
I'm sorry.

23:55.170 --> 23:57.770
Did you ever wonder about
me or care how I was doing?

23:58.080 --> 24:00.059
Because I wondered about you a lot.

24:00.060 --> 24:02.099
Wondered what, honey? I don't know what...

24:02.100 --> 24:03.980
I used to think that it was because of me,

24:04.040 --> 24:06.460
because I was damaged

24:06.570 --> 24:09.249
Or different, but it was you.

24:09.250 --> 24:10.689
You're the one with the problem.

24:10.690 --> 24:11.979
Hi, I'm Bay Kennish.

24:11.980 --> 24:13.849
Don't bother. This guy's an ass.

24:13.850 --> 24:17.089
I'm sorry. She has an axe to grind
with you for obvious reasons.

24:17.090 --> 24:18.590
He doesn't remember our mother.

24:19.060 --> 24:20.660
You don't remember Regina?

24:21.660 --> 24:22.660
Okay.

24:23.560 --> 24:25.070
I don't know who that is.

24:25.360 --> 24:27.569
And I have no idea who you are.

24:27.570 --> 24:30.190
Look at me, think.

24:30.530 --> 24:33.430
I know it was a long time ago,
but big clue, I'm deaf.

24:33.440 --> 24:35.129
And I'm looking for my father.

24:35.130 --> 24:37.449
I'm not here to yell at you
or blame you for anything.

24:37.450 --> 24:38.829
I just wanted to meet you so that

24:38.830 --> 24:40.480
I could say I've met you
and that you've met me.

24:40.760 --> 24:42.270
I still don't understand.

24:42.340 --> 24:43.909
There was a mistake at the hospital.

24:43.910 --> 24:46.410
Daphne's the one that you left.

24:48.320 --> 24:49.920
I'm your real daughter.

24:53.680 --> 24:56.499
Girls, I'm sorry,

24:56.500 --> 24:58.830
But I'm not anyone's father.

25:00.280 --> 25:02.280
But you're Angelo Sorrento.

25:02.280 --> 25:04.930
I am. I'm also gay.

25:06.130 --> 25:07.930
I have known since I was five.

25:08.050 --> 25:10.430
I've never slept with a woman.

25:10.780 --> 25:11.939
If you were my daughter,

25:11.940 --> 25:14.720
it would be the immaculate conception.

25:15.890 --> 25:17.700
Ever donate sperm?

25:18.350 --> 25:19.350
No.

25:19.460 --> 25:20.770
But we look alike.

25:20.990 --> 25:24.019
And that's flattering thinking
that I could be responsible

25:24.020 --> 25:27.140
for someone as beautiful
as you or both of you.

25:27.200 --> 25:29.210
Am I supposed to be both your dads?

25:29.570 --> 25:30.910
It's complicated.

25:36.370 --> 25:39.509
I'm terribly sorry.
I'm not who you're looking for,

25:39.510 --> 25:42.570
but I do hope you find him.

25:46.680 --> 25:47.830
Thanks.

25:59.950 --> 26:01.680
Have you heard from the girls?

26:02.000 --> 26:04.400
Daphne texted. They're grabbing a bite.

26:05.070 --> 26:06.870
That's a nice dress.

26:08.550 --> 26:09.840
What is it?

26:10.380 --> 26:14.240
Are you going to see Bruce?

26:14.620 --> 26:17.269
What are you gonna warn me about now, huh?

26:17.270 --> 26:19.089
Bruce talks on his cell
phone when he drives?

26:19.090 --> 26:20.789
Bruce wrecks the plots to good movies?

26:20.790 --> 26:22.480
Bruce won't take his shoes off in the house?

26:23.000 --> 26:25.460
Bruce is seeing Denise again.

26:26.320 --> 26:28.940
- No, he isn't.
- Yes, he is.

26:29.940 --> 26:31.619
Kathryn, I like him.

26:31.620 --> 26:33.149
I'm not just seeing him to piss you off.

26:33.150 --> 26:35.429
I know. That's why this is
so hard for me to tell you.

26:35.430 --> 26:37.589
No it's not. You've been
trying to break us up

26:37.590 --> 26:39.430
since before we started seeing each other.

26:40.580 --> 26:41.939
That's because I know Bruce.

26:41.940 --> 26:44.899
So do I. He's charming and generous,

26:44.900 --> 26:47.460
and it's been a long time
since I felt like this.

26:48.610 --> 26:50.129
Okay, Bruce came over here

26:50.130 --> 26:52.229
with an earring that he thought was yours.

26:52.230 --> 26:54.459
And then Denise came over
later and she saw it...

26:54.460 --> 26:57.150
Kathryn, stay out of my business.

27:08.630 --> 27:10.869
I can't believe that wasn't him.

27:10.870 --> 27:12.280
Shouldn't I have known?

27:12.480 --> 27:15.000
First clue should have
been that it was a gay bar.

27:15.120 --> 27:17.349
Seriously? Everyone in there was gay?

27:23.850 --> 27:26.129
I'm sorry I dragged you both into this.

27:26.130 --> 27:27.390
No, I'm happy I came.

27:27.620 --> 27:29.769
I needed to say all that,
and hopefully one day,

27:29.770 --> 27:31.550
I'll get to say it to the right guy.

27:31.770 --> 27:34.549
I can't do this again.
I think I'm done looking.

27:34.550 --> 27:35.509
You can't give up.

27:35.510 --> 27:38.779
There can't be that many
Angelo Sorrentos in the world.

27:48.180 --> 27:49.930
How do you know about that?

27:57.050 --> 28:00.000
Okay, well, we found this
guitar pick in his car, so...

28:02.980 --> 28:05.150
You found his car?

28:06.430 --> 28:08.020
In a junkyard.

28:08.160 --> 28:09.280
When?

28:09.810 --> 28:11.210
A few days ago.

28:18.530 --> 28:19.959
Okay, what do you think

28:19.960 --> 28:22.459
- is in the guitar case?
- I have no idea.

28:22.460 --> 28:24.250
- You've never looked at it?
- No.

28:24.350 --> 28:26.600
Well, could we look in your house?

28:28.750 --> 28:30.520
I thought you were done.

28:40.660 --> 28:42.380
How long can you stay tonight?

28:44.400 --> 28:46.739
I go to work in the morning,

28:46.740 --> 28:49.920
- so about an hour.
- Yeah?

28:50.380 --> 28:52.269
You know I came by to see you today.

28:52.270 --> 28:54.270
Yeah, Kathryn told me.

28:54.350 --> 28:55.840
Oh, I'm sure she did.

28:57.150 --> 28:58.300
She said...

29:01.060 --> 29:05.009
I know it's crazy, but she said

29:05.010 --> 29:08.049
you were sleeping

29:08.050 --> 29:10.380
- with your ex-wife.
- Which one?

29:11.620 --> 29:13.129
That's not funny.

29:13.130 --> 29:14.750
You're right. I'm sorry.

29:15.040 --> 29:16.370
Yes, I am.

29:19.030 --> 29:20.160
What?

29:22.190 --> 29:24.510
Wait. You are?

29:24.800 --> 29:27.329
Regina, I didn't know that
we were exclusive yet.

29:27.330 --> 29:28.790
We weren't, but...

29:30.080 --> 29:31.500
I mean, things were getting serious.

29:32.510 --> 29:34.430
I was gonna introduce you to Daphne.

29:35.460 --> 29:37.660
Okay, my head is spinning.

29:40.060 --> 29:41.670
Do you have feelings for her?

29:45.350 --> 29:47.520
Wow. You do.

29:48.310 --> 29:50.320
What if I have feelings for both of you?

29:50.470 --> 29:53.240
Okay, you can still only
sleep with one of us.

29:54.220 --> 29:55.890
And you have a history with her.

29:55.940 --> 29:58.010
Okay, what if I don't want history?

29:58.660 --> 30:00.000
What if I want you?

30:00.000 --> 30:02.160
In my experience, history usually wins.

30:02.320 --> 30:05.250
Regina, Regina, come on.

30:05.570 --> 30:06.670
Regina!

30:15.550 --> 30:17.549
Get out of here. It's over.

30:17.550 --> 30:19.459
I confessed to stealing
the test alone by myself.

30:19.460 --> 30:22.109
- Just get out.
- I don't get...

30:22.110 --> 30:24.539
Chad and James told Thatcher
I'm the one who sold them the tests.

30:24.540 --> 30:25.619
I'm suspended for two weeks,

30:25.620 --> 30:27.079
but I don't have to take you down with me.

30:27.080 --> 30:29.309
You're in the clear.
Go home, smoke a peace pipe.

30:29.310 --> 30:33.180
- Name your first child after me.
- Thank you. Thank you.

30:33.910 --> 30:35.000
Thank you.

31:52.820 --> 31:55.720
- Hi.
- Hi.

31:57.170 --> 32:00.559
So you were right

32:00.560 --> 32:02.520
about Denise and the...

32:03.710 --> 32:04.869
I was wrong,

32:04.870 --> 32:08.420
and Bruce is history.

32:09.250 --> 32:10.240
Good.

32:11.140 --> 32:13.720
- Well, you know, I wasn't meddling.
- You weren't?

32:14.420 --> 32:17.039
All right, fine. You're right, I was,

32:17.040 --> 32:19.200
but I'm just the kind of

32:19.830 --> 32:21.239
person that when I find
out my friend's boyfriend

32:21.240 --> 32:24.580
is sleeping with his ex-wife,
I tell that friend.

32:25.150 --> 32:27.490
So I'm your friend?

32:28.750 --> 32:30.869
Well, it's easier

32:30.870 --> 32:32.239
than calling you

32:32.240 --> 32:34.810
"My biological daughter's"

32:35.030 --> 32:39.110
- "other mother" over and over again.
- Yeah. Well, yeah.

32:40.150 --> 32:44.360
Okay, thanks for the heads up.

32:45.000 --> 32:47.629
Hey, you know, John's V.P.
at the car wash is single.

32:47.630 --> 32:48.930
Bye-bye, Kathryn.

33:01.230 --> 33:03.519
- You getting out?
- What is your hurry?

33:03.520 --> 33:05.479
Anxious for more of dad's stone-cold stares

33:05.480 --> 33:07.239
and dangerously repressed anger?

33:07.240 --> 33:08.949
Not after I tell him I fixed everything.

33:08.950 --> 33:11.030
Hmm... technically Wilke fixed everything.

33:11.370 --> 33:13.279
My point is I am not suspended.

33:13.280 --> 33:15.429
- My debt's clear. Everything is back to normal.
- Uh-huh.

33:15.430 --> 33:18.649
So that's it? Lesson learned,
you'll never do it again?

33:18.650 --> 33:20.059
Lesson learned, little sister.

33:20.060 --> 33:21.859
And you'll never do it again.

33:21.860 --> 33:24.029
What, break into school and
steal a test? Definitely not.

33:24.030 --> 33:25.100
Poker?

33:26.210 --> 33:27.019
I'm not gonna bet five

33:27.020 --> 33:29.460
grand on one hand again.
That was my mistake.

33:41.540 --> 33:44.380
- Hey, is your mom here?
- Yeah, why?

33:44.540 --> 33:46.440
We need to talk to her.

33:47.040 --> 33:48.509
Is it about the guitar case?

33:48.510 --> 33:51.120
No, about Toby. Can I come in?

33:52.730 --> 33:53.720
Yeah.

34:10.360 --> 34:11.670
Bay told you.

34:12.690 --> 34:13.989
You need help.

34:14.100 --> 34:15.639
No, she needs help.

34:15.639 --> 34:16.489
Now that I'm in the clear

34:16.489 --> 34:18.570
she can't stand being
the problem child again.

34:18.580 --> 34:21.380
Right. This is her fault.

34:22.290 --> 34:23.980
I don't have a problem.

34:24.090 --> 34:25.659
Nobody else thinks so, either.

34:26.000 --> 34:28.050
Okay, let's go.

34:29.239 --> 34:31.989
- What are you doing?
- Arm wrestling you for it.

34:31.989 --> 34:33.869
You win, mum's the word.

34:33.870 --> 34:36.380
I win, you're talking to
your parents. Let's go.

34:36.580 --> 34:37.780
You're crazy.

34:39.120 --> 34:40.610
You have an addiction.

34:41.199 --> 34:43.460
What, is this like radar?

34:43.469 --> 34:47.420
You alcoholics can just spot
somebody else with a problem?

34:47.760 --> 34:48.800
Yeah.

34:50.120 --> 34:51.299
Everything's fine.

34:51.300 --> 34:53.559
Nobody knows that I stole
the test. It's over.

34:53.560 --> 34:55.559
Wrong, you may not have gotten caught,

34:55.560 --> 34:58.790
but until you take responsibility
for how low you sank,

34:59.510 --> 35:00.860
it's not over.

35:02.590 --> 35:06.109
Well, I appreciate it,
but I really don't think

35:06.110 --> 35:07.550
it's any of your concern.

35:09.500 --> 35:11.529
Right, 'cause I'm just some lady

35:11.530 --> 35:13.170
who lives in your guest house?

35:14.720 --> 35:15.740
Hmm.

35:17.800 --> 35:19.450
Let me tell you something.

35:21.350 --> 35:23.090
When Daphne's father left,

35:23.110 --> 35:25.460
I promised myself I would stop drinking.

35:26.570 --> 35:28.499
Then after I lost all my clients,

35:28.500 --> 35:31.420
I promised myself again. And then again,

35:31.430 --> 35:33.810
after I stole money from my mom for vodka.

35:34.490 --> 35:35.820
And finally,

35:35.880 --> 35:38.940
social services threatened
to take Daphne away from me.

35:40.670 --> 35:42.109
That's when I figured out I'm not so good

35:42.110 --> 35:43.910
at keeping promises to myself.

35:44.640 --> 35:46.820
I had to start making them to other people.

35:49.460 --> 35:52.939
Toby, you need to tell your parents

35:52.940 --> 35:54.300
you have a problem.

36:00.860 --> 36:02.869
- Hey, Dale.
- I can't talk to you, John.

36:02.870 --> 36:03.769
Come on, man, you were all

36:03.770 --> 36:05.529
Chatty Cathy at the golf course last week.

36:05.530 --> 36:06.539
Now you're stalking me outside

36:06.540 --> 36:08.739
my office asking me for
info you know I can't give.

36:08.740 --> 36:10.130
Yes, you can, come on.

36:10.530 --> 36:12.369
Dale, what big secret does

36:12.370 --> 36:14.540
the hospital board have
on the Kennish family?

36:14.590 --> 36:16.909
Is it about me? Is it about Kathryn?

36:16.910 --> 36:17.719
'Cause if it's about Kathryn,

36:17.720 --> 36:19.749
you've got to tell me so
I can protect my wife.

36:19.750 --> 36:23.830
- I can't.
- Dale, for five minutes, be my friend.

36:23.960 --> 36:25.830
You know we've been through hell.

36:28.280 --> 36:29.189
Fine.

36:29.190 --> 36:30.719
It's all gonna come out in discovery anyway.

36:30.720 --> 36:34.499
It's not what we have on you or Kathryn.
It's the other mom.

36:34.500 --> 36:36.780
Regina? She's not even part of the lawsuit.

36:38.960 --> 36:39.959
Is it the D.U.I.?

36:39.960 --> 36:41.640
It's got nothing to do with it.

36:43.020 --> 36:44.599
- It's gotta be the D.U.I.
- It's not.

36:44.600 --> 36:45.729
It's something else.

36:45.730 --> 36:47.149
Something worse than... What? What?

36:47.150 --> 36:49.800
- I've said too much already.
- Please, Dale, just...

36:49.990 --> 36:51.000
Dale.

36:54.230 --> 36:57.260
So should I make dinner for two or three?

36:57.260 --> 36:59.510
Yeah, I think it's just gonna be us.

36:59.730 --> 37:01.260
I don't get to meet Bruce?

37:01.390 --> 37:03.350
Yeah, I ended it.

37:03.660 --> 37:04.650
I'm sorry.

37:05.240 --> 37:07.310
It's better when it's just us anyway.

37:10.860 --> 37:13.410
So, mom, how come you don't
play the guitar anymore?

37:14.430 --> 37:15.590
'Cause I never did.

37:15.970 --> 37:18.170
But you have that guitar case.

37:19.500 --> 37:21.549
Oh, that.

37:21.550 --> 37:23.960
You know, I don't know
why I still have that.

37:24.550 --> 37:27.060
I'm such a pack rat. I should get rid of it.

37:27.090 --> 37:29.770
I'm gonna go get the rest from the car.

37:39.220 --> 37:40.230
Hi.

37:41.570 --> 37:44.300
Daphne's not here. Her class isn't today.

37:53.800 --> 37:55.510
- and I were talking.
- Daphne... you.

37:56.310 --> 37:58.110
You and Daphne were talking.

37:59.010 --> 38:02.539
Okay, you and Daphne were
talking about you and me?

38:02.540 --> 38:05.180
Okay, no, you guys were not
talking about you and me.

38:47.820 --> 38:50.010
- Can I give you something?
- Sure.

38:51.630 --> 38:53.010
It's my lucky deck.

38:55.150 --> 38:56.540
What, are you serious?

38:57.600 --> 38:59.860
Okay, maybe my not-so-lucky deck.

39:00.450 --> 39:02.390
And why are you giving this to me?

39:03.950 --> 39:06.189
Because I lost $10,000,

39:06.190 --> 39:07.730
almost got kicked out of school,

39:08.910 --> 39:09.929
and still all I can think about

39:09.930 --> 39:11.420
is getting back to the table.

39:12.440 --> 39:15.290
You understand I can't
always be around to stop you.

39:16.240 --> 39:17.340
Yeah, I know,

39:17.530 --> 39:20.970
but I need to be accountable to somebody.

39:22.430 --> 39:24.230
And I'd like to be accountable to you.

39:26.070 --> 39:28.480
I can't let Wilke take
the whole blame for this.

39:29.960 --> 39:32.459
So tomorrow I'm gonna go see Mr. Thatcher

39:32.460 --> 39:33.760
and tell him the truth...

39:34.500 --> 39:36.250
that I sold the test.

39:44.060 --> 39:45.250
Good man.

39:53.890 --> 39:56.749
I'm going to Melody's. We're gonna gossip

39:56.750 --> 39:58.770
and eat fancy cheese.

39:59.550 --> 40:01.290
That always cheers us up.
