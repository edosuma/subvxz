00:01.269 --> 00:03.571
You're facing your fears
with The Exorcist.

00:03.604 --> 00:06.174
-Unclean spirit!
-In the name of God!

00:06.207 --> 00:07.908
Catch all-new episodes Fridays.

00:07.941 --> 00:09.543
And check out
our other Fox programs--

00:09.577 --> 00:12.146
The Gifted, Lucifer, and Gotham.

00:12.180 --> 00:14.382
I can make a difference, Alfred.
I know I can.

00:14.415 --> 00:15.749
Only on Fox.

00:18.252 --> 00:19.753
MARCUS: Previously
on The Exorcist...

00:19.787 --> 00:21.322
And there were others that also
took unnecessary risks.

00:21.355 --> 00:23.057
All of them paid for it,

00:23.091 --> 00:24.492
because that's what happens

00:24.525 --> 00:26.627
when you let
the darkness inside.

00:28.796 --> 00:32.200
TOMAS: You hate the fact
that he chose me and not you.

00:33.867 --> 00:35.503
CARO: That performance
Cardinal Guillot put on

00:35.536 --> 00:38.772
for the tribunal, pure
pageantry. He is protected.

00:38.806 --> 00:40.374
Caleb told me you took him
out to the well.

00:40.408 --> 00:42.843
Apparently, you left him
on the well by himself.

00:42.876 --> 00:45.045
-You believe this?
-If you file this report,

00:45.079 --> 00:46.780
you jeopardize our entire home.

00:46.814 --> 00:50.218
There are still those
loyal to the cause,

00:50.251 --> 00:52.786
even if their methods
are somewhat disagreeable.

00:52.820 --> 00:55.523
The Vatican's been compromised.
They'll be looking for you.

00:55.556 --> 00:58.092
-How do I get in touch with you?
-You don't.

00:58.126 --> 00:59.593
Where are we going?

00:59.627 --> 01:01.395
MARCUS:
I've got a place in mind.

01:03.297 --> 01:06.434
(men chanting)

01:06.467 --> 01:10.204
We beseech you
and your legion to rise

01:10.238 --> 01:13.207
and walk among us.

01:13.241 --> 01:15.743
Star of morning.

01:15.776 --> 01:18.279
Son of dawn.

01:18.312 --> 01:19.813
Star of morning.

01:19.847 --> 01:21.415
Son of dawn.

01:21.449 --> 01:24.285
We beseech you
and your legion

01:24.318 --> 01:28.456
to rise and walk among us.

01:33.627 --> 01:36.330
Vocare Pulvere.

01:36.364 --> 01:39.467
Vocare Pulvere.
Pulvere. Pulvere.

01:41.702 --> 01:43.637
(growls)

01:50.878 --> 01:52.813
(gasping)

01:55.015 --> 01:57.151
(grunts)

02:05.125 --> 02:08.095
GUILLOT:
Welcome, brother.

02:08.128 --> 02:11.465
(laughter)

02:11.499 --> 02:13.634
(laughter continues in distance)

02:17.137 --> 02:20.674
I have a surprise for everyone.

02:20.708 --> 02:23.143
Please.

02:35.189 --> 02:37.558
The almond tart.

02:37.591 --> 02:41.829
You almost want
to give thanks to God.

02:41.862 --> 02:42.963
(laughter)

02:42.996 --> 02:45.433
(cat mews)

02:51.505 --> 02:54.475
It's said that
the reason cats climb

02:54.508 --> 02:59.280
is so they can look down
on other animals.

03:01.048 --> 03:03.317
It's also why they hate birds.

03:03.351 --> 03:05.919
(laughter)

03:05.953 --> 03:07.721
Brothers.

03:07.755 --> 03:10.591
We've climbed high,

03:10.624 --> 03:15.028
and soon, we'll look down on
the rest of the world

03:15.062 --> 03:18.232
and begin the task
of remaking it.

03:38.819 --> 03:40.788
(gags)

03:40.821 --> 03:42.222
ACOLYTE:
Cardinal.

03:43.291 --> 03:44.792
-Cardinal Guillot.
-(choking)

03:46.294 --> 03:48.262
-(gagging)
-Ã‡a va?

04:15.856 --> 04:17.758
*

04:41.281 --> 04:44.652
*

05:15.148 --> 05:16.817
(shoveling)

05:40.574 --> 05:42.710
(rustling nearby)

05:50.050 --> 05:52.453
(rustling in hole)

06:05.298 --> 06:07.501
ANDY:
Verity swears up and down

06:07.535 --> 06:10.070
that she was not the one
that took you to the well.

06:13.541 --> 06:15.342
And you believe her?

06:15.375 --> 06:17.177
Yes, I do.

06:17.210 --> 06:19.813
So I'm a liar.

06:23.083 --> 06:26.186
Caleb, I didn't say that.

06:26.219 --> 06:29.623
What I said was I thought you
were maybe sleepwalking.

06:29.657 --> 06:31.391
Look at Truck.
He gets upset,

06:31.425 --> 06:33.694
he goes walking, he wakes up,
he doesn't know where he is.

06:33.727 --> 06:35.395
It's like he's having
a bad dream.

06:35.429 --> 06:36.930
It wasn't a dream.

06:36.964 --> 06:39.299
Verity was there;
she held my hand.

06:39.332 --> 06:42.803
-Verity's your sister.
-Foster sister.

06:48.141 --> 06:49.710
Do you really think

06:49.743 --> 06:52.746
that she would leave you
in danger like that?

06:55.415 --> 06:57.551
I don't know.

06:57.585 --> 07:00.053
-Well, I do.
-(zipper closes)

07:00.087 --> 07:02.255
(toilet flushes)

07:02.289 --> 07:03.757
Are you guys done yet?

07:03.791 --> 07:06.159
-Just about.
-TRUCK: Hey.

07:06.193 --> 07:09.096
Uh, tell-tell him why you're
always cleaning your eyes.

07:10.598 --> 07:13.233
So I don't give people
dirty looks.

07:13.266 --> 07:15.002
(Truck laughs)

07:15.035 --> 07:17.638
-That's good stuff.
-(giggles)

07:17.671 --> 07:19.907
You guys should take this
on the road.

07:19.940 --> 07:22.075
Think about what I said, okay?

07:22.109 --> 07:23.711
Okay.

07:25.445 --> 07:26.947
Verity.

07:26.980 --> 07:28.248
Verity, wait.

07:28.281 --> 07:29.483
-Wait.
-What?

07:29.517 --> 07:31.418
I'm...

07:31.451 --> 07:33.086
I'm sorry I came at you
like that.

07:33.120 --> 07:34.755
I got a little carried away
and...

07:34.788 --> 07:36.824
(scoffs)
Carried away?

07:36.857 --> 07:38.759
I'm just trying to get
to the bottom of all this.

07:38.792 --> 07:41.428
Okay? We're under
so much stress, all of us.

07:41.461 --> 07:43.764
My only stress
is that my foster dad

07:43.797 --> 07:46.700
-thinks I tried to murder my own
brother. -That's not what I s...

07:48.969 --> 07:53.140
SHELBY: Don't let anybody go
in the woods.

07:53.173 --> 07:55.643
We talked about this
last night, Shelby.

07:55.676 --> 07:57.678
No, there's something out there.

07:57.711 --> 07:59.146
It was a lamb.

07:59.179 --> 08:00.714
Just a lamb with birth defects.

08:00.748 --> 08:02.282
It happened.
It's not an omen.

08:02.315 --> 08:04.217
-No, no, no. -It's just what
nature does sometimes.

08:04.251 --> 08:06.386
Andy, you weren't there.

08:06.419 --> 08:09.356
All right? I felt it.

08:09.389 --> 08:12.192
Do you know what happens
to our house

08:12.225 --> 08:14.628
if Rose catches you
smearing blood all over

08:14.662 --> 08:16.463
our front door?
Do you know what happens?

08:16.496 --> 08:19.767
Andy, I was trying
to protect us.

08:20.934 --> 08:23.136
Your faith is important
to you and I...

08:23.170 --> 08:24.638
and I appreciate that,

08:24.672 --> 08:28.041
but let's stick to prayer, okay?

08:28.075 --> 08:30.544
It's easier to clean up.

08:33.614 --> 08:36.516
Thank you.
Get ready for school.

08:49.362 --> 08:51.398
You're up early.

08:51.431 --> 08:55.502
Yeah. Got to head into town,
deal with this case.

08:55.535 --> 08:57.037
Coffee?

08:57.070 --> 08:59.773
Yes, please.

09:09.216 --> 09:12.052
So, um, you should know

09:12.085 --> 09:15.422
that I will not be filing
a report on Caleb.

09:15.455 --> 09:17.591
Really?

09:19.559 --> 09:21.695
Um...

09:21.729 --> 09:23.897
What changed your mind?

09:23.931 --> 09:25.733
What you said last night.

09:25.766 --> 09:27.935
That and the agency

09:27.968 --> 09:30.070
will probably view it
in the worst possible light.

09:30.103 --> 09:33.807
I don't want that to color
the assessment.

09:35.575 --> 09:37.277
(sighs)

09:37.310 --> 09:39.780
Uh, I appreciate it.

09:39.813 --> 09:43.884
But, uh, Andy, it doesn't matter
what I tell them.

09:43.917 --> 09:46.319
It's still state law
that group homes must be run

09:46.353 --> 09:47.821
by at least two people.

09:47.855 --> 09:49.723
I don't know a way around it.

09:49.757 --> 09:52.559
One battle at a time, I guess.

09:52.592 --> 09:54.728
ROSE (softly):
Yeah.

09:54.762 --> 09:56.730
I mean, you could just move in.

09:56.764 --> 09:59.032
I mean, we have the space.

10:03.704 --> 10:05.839
*

10:18.952 --> 10:21.121
-(screams)
-(gasps)

10:23.290 --> 10:25.025
(gasping)

10:27.828 --> 10:30.263
Sweet dreams.

10:30.297 --> 10:33.266
Where are we?

10:33.300 --> 10:35.235
Here.

10:53.653 --> 10:55.555
(truck door closes)

10:55.588 --> 10:58.125
So much for keeping
a low profile.

10:58.158 --> 11:00.327
Bennett would have our guts
for garters

11:00.360 --> 11:01.795
for taking a risk like this.

11:01.829 --> 11:04.064
Now, this friend of yours
from the diocese,

11:04.097 --> 11:07.500
the deacon,
you trust his judgment?

11:07.534 --> 11:11.872
All I know is he took one look
at this girl and called me.

11:11.905 --> 11:14.775
And the risk doesn't matter?

11:36.529 --> 11:39.232
-(clears throat)
-Mrs. Graham.

11:39.266 --> 11:40.934
My name's Marcus Keane.

11:40.968 --> 11:42.936
I was told
you'd be expecting us.

11:42.970 --> 11:45.238
You're not a priest.

11:45.272 --> 11:47.340
Not anymore, no.

11:47.374 --> 11:51.111
But this is my associate,
Father Tomas Ortega.

11:51.144 --> 11:52.880
Hi.

11:56.283 --> 11:58.385
Please, come in.

12:07.895 --> 12:09.863
TOMAS:
Is this your daughter?

12:09.897 --> 12:13.633
LORRAINE:
Harper, yes.

12:13.666 --> 12:16.369
You have no idea how many times
I've gone to the Church.

12:16.403 --> 12:18.105
Thank God
somebody finally listened.

12:18.138 --> 12:20.573
I-I didn't know what else to do.

12:20.607 --> 12:22.475
Well, we're here now.

12:22.509 --> 12:25.412
Why don't you tell us
what's happening.

12:28.348 --> 12:32.252
Harper has been perfectly
healthy her whole life.

12:32.285 --> 12:36.489
Six months ago,
everything changed.

12:37.590 --> 12:39.492
At first, it was little things.

12:39.526 --> 12:41.128
Fighting with teachers, with me.

12:41.161 --> 12:43.230
I thought she was acting out
because of the divorce

12:43.263 --> 12:47.567
and her father moving overseas,
but then she...

12:47.600 --> 12:50.437
started seeing things.

12:50.470 --> 12:52.105
Like what?

12:54.274 --> 12:59.046
An imaginary playmate
she had when she was a child.

13:00.713 --> 13:03.183
Where is Harper now?

13:03.216 --> 13:04.584
She's upstairs.

13:04.617 --> 13:06.854
In her room.

13:16.629 --> 13:17.865
(door creaking)

13:17.898 --> 13:20.033
(Harper whimpers)

13:22.469 --> 13:24.905
(Harper panting)

13:35.515 --> 13:37.484
(whimpering)

13:41.654 --> 13:44.157
(panting)

13:45.492 --> 13:47.260
(low growling)

13:51.498 --> 13:53.934
(whimpering)

14:00.840 --> 14:03.010
(birds chirping)

14:03.043 --> 14:05.345
CALEB: You study
for the history test?

14:05.378 --> 14:06.513
Sure did.

14:06.546 --> 14:09.149
Then where was the Declaration
of Independence signed?

14:09.182 --> 14:12.352
At the bottom of the page.

14:12.385 --> 14:14.354
You're gonna fail.

14:24.264 --> 14:25.232
Well?

14:25.265 --> 14:27.234
TOMAS:
She's sleeping.

14:27.267 --> 14:29.602
LORRAINE:
Thank God.

14:29.636 --> 14:31.371
Do you?

14:31.404 --> 14:32.572
Really?

14:32.605 --> 14:34.674
Does it matter?

14:34.707 --> 14:36.676
It might do, yeah.

14:36.709 --> 14:39.179
Well, as Harper's gotten worse,

14:39.212 --> 14:41.548
faith is the only thing
that's holding me up.

14:43.316 --> 14:44.884
I... believe

14:44.918 --> 14:47.187
that there is something that's
taken over my little girl,

14:47.220 --> 14:50.123
and it's doing everything
in its power to destroy her.

14:50.157 --> 14:51.992
What kind of something?

14:52.892 --> 14:55.862
It's, um...

14:55.895 --> 14:57.864
unclean.

14:57.897 --> 15:00.900
I don't know
how else to describe it.

15:02.569 --> 15:06.406
Tell me you're here to send it
back to Hell, where it belongs.

15:06.439 --> 15:07.407
Yes, of course.

15:07.440 --> 15:08.908
Possibly.

15:10.610 --> 15:13.880
There are aspects to possession

15:13.913 --> 15:15.415
that have to be catalogued

15:15.448 --> 15:18.251
before an exorcism
can be granted.

15:19.752 --> 15:21.421
That's right. Yes.

15:21.454 --> 15:23.957
Like what?

15:23.991 --> 15:26.093
Uh, speaking in tongues,

15:26.126 --> 15:28.395
um, foreign languages.

15:28.428 --> 15:30.897
Abilities beyond the ordinary.

15:30.930 --> 15:34.167
Uh, having impossible knowledge.

15:44.777 --> 15:46.679
You mean like this?

15:52.119 --> 15:55.188
Harper drew that
three weeks ago.

15:55.222 --> 15:59.059
-(house shaking)
-(Harper shouting)

16:04.364 --> 16:07.534
That thing inside my daughter,

16:07.567 --> 16:09.569
it knew you were coming.

16:15.408 --> 16:18.345
LORRAINE:
You know Chris MacNeil's story?

16:18.378 --> 16:20.280
About her daughter's possession?

16:20.313 --> 16:23.650
Uh, we're familiar with it.

16:23.683 --> 16:25.785
I've read it many times.

16:25.818 --> 16:27.787
It's the only comfort I have,

16:27.820 --> 16:30.957
knowing I'm not alone.

16:30.990 --> 16:33.960
(door creaking)

16:33.993 --> 16:35.295
Mom?

16:35.328 --> 16:36.963
I'm here, sweetheart.

16:36.996 --> 16:39.366
I'm here.

16:49.442 --> 16:51.178
(grunts softly)

16:53.780 --> 16:55.215
Hello, Harper.

16:56.749 --> 16:59.652
My name's Marcus,
and this is Tomas.

16:59.686 --> 17:00.687
Hi.

17:02.855 --> 17:05.258
No needles.

17:05.292 --> 17:07.227
No, no, no, we're not doctors.

17:07.260 --> 17:09.696
We just want to talk.

17:09.729 --> 17:12.732
Your mum's been telling us
your story.

17:12.765 --> 17:16.203
She thinks
we might be able to help you.

17:17.104 --> 17:19.072
(exhales)

17:19.106 --> 17:21.608
You can't help.

17:21.641 --> 17:24.411
TOMAS:
Well, I don't know about that.

17:25.278 --> 17:26.846
We've done this before,

17:26.879 --> 17:30.350
and we're pretty good at it.

17:30.383 --> 17:34.254
Your mum tells me
you've got an imaginary friend.

17:39.226 --> 17:40.660
What's his name?

17:41.761 --> 17:44.697
Tobias.

17:44.731 --> 17:46.866
Can I see Tobias?

17:46.899 --> 17:49.202
No one can see him.

17:49.236 --> 17:51.738
MARCUS:
No one except you.

17:54.241 --> 17:56.443
What does Tobias look like?

17:59.612 --> 18:02.115
(paper rustling)

18:04.584 --> 18:06.486
Is that him?

18:06.519 --> 18:08.521
Yes.

18:09.522 --> 18:13.059
Ain't much of a looker, is he?

18:13.092 --> 18:15.395
You're a good artist, you know.

18:15.428 --> 18:18.131
-My partner looks a bit podgy.
-(Tomas chuckles)

18:18.165 --> 18:20.300
Is my nose
really like that?

18:22.935 --> 18:25.305
Can you make Tobias come out?

18:25.338 --> 18:27.574
To say hello to us?

18:27.607 --> 18:30.443
He-He's hiding.

18:30.477 --> 18:31.444
Where?

18:32.312 --> 18:34.814
Behind my tongue.

18:34.847 --> 18:37.417
And when he gets mad,

18:37.450 --> 18:39.686
that's when his teeth come out.

18:42.021 --> 18:43.923
Right. Let's have a look
at the old toad.

18:43.956 --> 18:45.458
What do you say?

18:57.970 --> 18:59.872
Open wider.

19:06.746 --> 19:07.847
Guess he's not home.

19:08.981 --> 19:11.451
Or maybe he knows my secret.

19:11.484 --> 19:13.753
I've got a weakness
for frogs' legs.

19:14.854 --> 19:16.823
Mm.

19:16.856 --> 19:18.991
Mm.
(grunting)

19:19.025 --> 19:20.860
-(gasping)
-(house shaking)

19:20.893 --> 19:21.861
It's coming.

19:21.894 --> 19:24.163
(shouting, gasping)

19:24.197 --> 19:25.898
(whimpering, shouting)

19:27.700 --> 19:29.168
Ah!

19:34.841 --> 19:36.843
(shouting, gasping)

19:36.876 --> 19:39.812
(speaking Aramaic)

19:39.846 --> 19:42.215
(coughing)

19:43.182 --> 19:44.251
(shouting)

19:44.284 --> 19:45.452
Tomas.

19:47.119 --> 19:49.689
(speaking Spanish)

19:51.224 --> 19:52.058
(screaming)

19:52.091 --> 19:54.527
(speaking French)

20:14.414 --> 20:17.684
(organ playing)

20:17.717 --> 20:22.689
For a priest, you seem to have
a problem with sacraments.

20:22.722 --> 20:24.223
Who are you?

20:24.257 --> 20:25.892
You should know.

20:25.925 --> 20:27.760
Caro sent you to find me.

20:27.794 --> 20:30.129
I've been coming here
for three days.

20:30.162 --> 20:33.266
And you haven't
taken communion once.

20:33.300 --> 20:35.502
Why's that?

20:37.169 --> 20:39.439
Maybe I didn't feel worthy.

20:39.472 --> 20:42.241
Well, one way or another,

20:42.275 --> 20:45.244
you shall be healed.

20:52.585 --> 20:54.754
Le corps du Christ.

20:59.091 --> 21:00.593
Le corps du Christ.

21:00.627 --> 21:01.961
Amen.

21:07.266 --> 21:08.935
Le corps du Christ.

21:08.968 --> 21:11.270
Amen.

21:23.716 --> 21:25.284
Your turn.

21:27.987 --> 21:29.956
Le corps du Christ.

21:29.989 --> 21:31.891
Amen.

21:42.134 --> 21:43.970
Caro was arrested.

21:44.003 --> 21:45.438
I'm sure you've heard.

21:45.472 --> 21:48.375
If they have him,
he's already dead.

21:48.408 --> 21:49.876
Or worse.

21:49.909 --> 21:52.879
If they hadn't forced my hand
with Guillot...

21:52.912 --> 21:55.147
I should never
have involved him.

21:55.181 --> 21:58.818
Well, you don't have to worry
about the good cardinal anymore.

21:58.851 --> 22:00.119
What do you mean?

22:00.152 --> 22:04.290
He was entertaining guests
when a fire broke out.

22:04.323 --> 22:06.292
No survivors.

22:06.325 --> 22:08.361
Very tragic.

22:08.395 --> 22:10.997
Who are you?

22:12.098 --> 22:14.300
Mouse.

22:14.333 --> 22:16.469
That's not a name.

22:16.503 --> 22:19.439
Is that really what you want
to talk about?

22:20.773 --> 22:22.542
Listen...

22:22.575 --> 22:24.977
we've both been fighting
the same war.

22:25.011 --> 22:28.848
I believe Caro meant for us
to fight it together.

22:28.881 --> 22:31.684
I don't need someone
to hold my hand.

22:31.718 --> 22:33.986
Look, I don't want to
hold your hand, Mouse.

22:34.020 --> 22:36.889
Look, if you want
to go it alone, that's fine.

22:36.923 --> 22:40.059
Just tell me everything you know
about the conspiracy.

22:42.929 --> 22:44.864
I have something better.

22:49.536 --> 22:51.704
You can meet my source.

23:02.048 --> 23:03.282
Her pulse is very rapid.

23:03.315 --> 23:05.051
Her blood pressure
is 140 over 90.

23:05.084 --> 23:06.285
We need to start soon.

23:06.318 --> 23:07.954
Start what?

23:09.489 --> 23:10.923
We haven't established proof.

23:13.392 --> 23:14.761
Physical strength.

23:14.794 --> 23:16.896
The drawing she made-- that's
knowledge of future events...

23:16.929 --> 23:19.031
Not enough.

23:19.065 --> 23:21.568
I spoke to her in Aramaic.
You tried Spanish.

23:21.601 --> 23:23.536
Did you hear an answer?
'Cause I didn't.

23:23.570 --> 23:25.104
Don't think with your heart.

23:25.137 --> 23:28.775
Think with your head.
We have to follow procedure.

23:31.778 --> 23:35.381
You're... you're not
gonna help her?

23:35.414 --> 23:37.049
We need to be sure, Mrs. Graham.

23:37.083 --> 23:38.618
Because if Harper
isn't possessed,

23:38.651 --> 23:41.087
then an exorcism
would do more harm than good.

23:41.120 --> 23:43.055
What?

23:43.089 --> 23:45.057
It could reinforce
the false belief

23:45.091 --> 23:47.494
to a point where
she'd never let it go.

23:47.527 --> 23:49.562
Which could lead her
to self-harm

23:49.596 --> 23:51.764
or even take her own life.

23:54.166 --> 23:56.836
Shouldn't a priest
be deciding this?

24:04.477 --> 24:08.147
(Lorraine screams, pants)

24:10.617 --> 24:13.452
Something bit me.

24:30.236 --> 24:32.171
(echoing whispers)

24:39.345 --> 24:41.981
(echoing whispers)

24:44.551 --> 24:46.553
Stay back.

24:46.586 --> 24:49.188
I got a Bible here.

24:56.362 --> 24:58.531
Well, could be worse, I guess.

24:58.565 --> 25:00.567
Could have been my house
he smeared with blood.

25:00.600 --> 25:01.834
(chuckles)

25:01.868 --> 25:03.570
Are you sure
you won't have a beer?

25:03.603 --> 25:05.572
Guaranteed not organic.

25:05.605 --> 25:07.540
No, thank you.
It's a little early for me.

25:07.574 --> 25:09.208
(chuckles)

25:10.509 --> 25:11.644
Two sips.

25:11.678 --> 25:13.012
(Russ laughs)

25:14.614 --> 25:17.183
This is definitely not the plan.

25:18.685 --> 25:20.319
I was gonna be a stockbroker.

25:20.352 --> 25:23.556
-Get out.
-Mm.

25:23.590 --> 25:26.826
Shoot.
(chuckles)

25:26.859 --> 25:28.995
Yeah, the whole nine yards.

25:29.028 --> 25:31.731
Manhattan penthouse,
Italian sports car

25:31.764 --> 25:32.999
with a three-year wait list.

25:33.032 --> 25:35.668
And you came
to your senses when?

25:35.702 --> 25:37.269
(chuckles)

25:37.303 --> 25:39.505
College.

25:39.538 --> 25:41.540
Met a girl.
She made me think deeper

25:41.574 --> 25:44.010
about the world...
and the people in it.

25:44.043 --> 25:46.278
Changed majors
from business to psychology.

25:46.312 --> 25:50.016
I'd be practicing now
if it wasn't for the kids.

25:50.049 --> 25:51.784
I mean, don't get me wrong--
those kids

25:51.818 --> 25:53.753
are the best thing
that's ever happened to me.

25:53.786 --> 25:55.622
But every now and again,
you think about

25:55.655 --> 25:59.225
that Italian sports car
on the road not taken.

26:10.069 --> 26:11.738
Hey, Russ...

26:13.405 --> 26:17.043
...you ever come across anything
on this island that you...

26:17.076 --> 26:19.211
can't explain?

26:19.245 --> 26:20.747
Like what?

26:22.682 --> 26:24.817
Forget it.

26:26.185 --> 26:27.820
Thank you.

26:42.134 --> 26:43.670
"Lord Jesus,

26:43.703 --> 26:46.072
"I place myself
at the foot of your cross.

26:46.105 --> 26:48.741
"And I ask you to surround me
with Holy Light

26:48.775 --> 26:51.878
and the living water
that flows from your heart."

27:01.453 --> 27:02.822
-Mrs. Graham?
-Yes.

27:02.855 --> 27:05.457
Hi. Uh, my name is Rose Cooper,
and I'm from

27:05.491 --> 27:07.794
the State Department
of Health and Social Services.

27:07.827 --> 27:10.963
We got a call
about your daughter, Harper.

27:10.997 --> 27:12.965
Apparently she's been exhibiting

27:12.999 --> 27:14.500
some concerning behavior
at school,

27:14.533 --> 27:17.770
and she hasn't attended class
for several weeks.

27:17.804 --> 27:19.672
She's been fighting
a very bad flu.

27:19.706 --> 27:22.174
Uh, I told the school
all about it.

27:23.475 --> 27:25.812
Can I speak with Harper, please?

27:25.845 --> 27:28.614
Well, I'm sorry,
she's still contagious.

27:28.647 --> 27:31.517
Oh, I've had my shots.

27:31.550 --> 27:33.485
Well, and she's napping.

27:33.519 --> 27:35.955
I'm happy to wait.

27:35.988 --> 27:38.057
(chuckles nervously)

27:38.090 --> 27:39.525
I'm...

27:39.558 --> 27:42.128
I appreciate your concern,
but this isn't a good time.

27:42.161 --> 27:43.963
-My daughter needs her rest.
-Mrs. Graham....

27:43.996 --> 27:47.099
Um, maybe we can schedule
something for later in the week.

27:49.001 --> 27:52.538
The alternative is to
get law enforcement involved.

27:52.571 --> 27:55.975
Is that what you really want?

27:56.008 --> 27:58.410
Um, I'm sorry.
Maybe... maybe tomorrow.

28:02.749 --> 28:05.584
(exhales)

28:05.617 --> 28:07.186
You did that well.

28:10.222 --> 28:13.692
I have been dealing with
people like her for years.

28:16.896 --> 28:18.765
You're bleeding.

28:23.035 --> 28:25.137
(harsh, raspy breaths)

28:40.286 --> 28:42.922
You gonna do this
all by your lonesome, are you?

28:43.956 --> 28:45.858
I have all the proof
that I need.

28:45.892 --> 28:47.393
Do share.

28:49.796 --> 28:52.531
I had a vision inside the truck.

28:52.564 --> 28:54.400
A vision of this girl.

28:54.433 --> 28:57.203
Oh.

28:57.236 --> 29:00.973
You let a demon
into your head, Tomas.

29:01.007 --> 29:04.376
Evil leaves a mark.
It stains.

29:04.410 --> 29:06.779
Now every thought you have,
every decision that you make,

29:06.813 --> 29:08.080
is compromised.

29:08.114 --> 29:10.917
What if God
is telling me something?

29:12.018 --> 29:14.753
This girl is dying

29:14.787 --> 29:17.056
and I'm going to save her.

29:17.089 --> 29:18.390
No.

29:18.424 --> 29:20.159
You're not.

29:25.464 --> 29:27.766
Stay here with Harper.

29:34.006 --> 29:35.441
Can I help you with something?

29:37.443 --> 29:40.179
Who are you? And why
is there a priest in there?

29:40.212 --> 29:42.915
We're friend's of Mrs. Graham's,
here to provide spiritual help.

29:42.949 --> 29:44.750
What is going on in there?

29:44.783 --> 29:46.018
It's none of your business.

29:46.052 --> 29:47.619
Fine. Well, the state
says differently,

29:47.653 --> 29:51.123
so if you don't want to talk to
me, you can talk to the police.

29:54.160 --> 29:57.763
We're here 'cause Mrs. Graham
called us about her daughter.

29:57.796 --> 29:59.431
Yeah, I'm not surprised.
She's desperate.

29:59.465 --> 30:02.001
That poor girl's been in and
out of hospitals all her life.

30:02.034 --> 30:04.170
All her life?

30:17.383 --> 30:19.118
Come on, Grace.
We had a deal.

30:19.151 --> 30:22.554
We read chapter seven inside,
chapter eight on the porch.

30:22.588 --> 30:25.657
Can't we read chapter nine
on the porch?

30:25.691 --> 30:28.494
You've been putting me off
for three chapters.

30:28.527 --> 30:30.496
A deal's a deal. 'Kay?

30:33.866 --> 30:36.002
*

31:00.859 --> 31:02.828
Hey.

31:02.861 --> 31:04.964
You did it.

31:06.232 --> 31:08.200
Yes!

31:10.269 --> 31:12.038
I want to show you something.

31:13.372 --> 31:15.942
-They're really coming in.
-They're huge.

31:15.975 --> 31:18.844
I know. Want to touch it?

31:18.877 --> 31:21.447
Go ahead.

31:23.382 --> 31:24.917
Fuzzy, huh?

31:24.951 --> 31:26.185
Yeah.

31:26.218 --> 31:28.387
-Like your nose.
-(giggles)

31:30.990 --> 31:33.993
(birds squawking)

31:36.795 --> 31:38.397
What's that?

31:42.134 --> 31:44.436
I don't know.

31:44.470 --> 31:48.374
"My strength and courage
is the Lord,

31:48.407 --> 31:50.509
and he has been my savior."

31:52.979 --> 31:55.114
(birds squawking)

32:03.522 --> 32:05.624
(squawking continues)

32:05.657 --> 32:07.593
I'm scared.

32:10.796 --> 32:12.664
Come on.

32:12.698 --> 32:14.633
(grunts) Come on.

32:18.770 --> 32:20.939
(birds squawking, shrieking)

32:28.680 --> 32:30.616
(birds crashing)

32:38.057 --> 32:40.459
-(screams)
-Ah! It's all right.

32:42.628 --> 32:44.496
(glass shattering)

32:49.668 --> 32:51.637
*

33:07.986 --> 33:10.156
GRACE:
Why did they do that?

33:11.690 --> 33:13.659
I don't know, sweetheart.

33:15.227 --> 33:17.829
Maybe they got confused.

33:17.863 --> 33:20.632
Sometimes animals get spooked.

33:20.666 --> 33:23.269
Could have heard a loud noise
or something.

33:25.104 --> 33:28.174
I don't want to go outside
anymore.

33:28.207 --> 33:31.009
I want to stay with you.

33:32.911 --> 33:35.013
Whoa.

33:35.047 --> 33:36.815
Grace.

33:36.848 --> 33:39.818
(doorbell ringing)

33:39.851 --> 33:42.354
(sighs)

33:46.024 --> 33:48.060
Um... here.

33:48.094 --> 33:52.764
You... you stay
with Buster, okay?

33:52.798 --> 33:55.101
I'll be right back.

33:58.737 --> 34:02.007
You were asking me about things
I can't explain?

34:02.040 --> 34:04.843
Is this what you meant?

34:04.876 --> 34:07.045
This would qualify.

34:12.551 --> 34:14.520
RUSS: Yeah, they flew
right over my house.

34:14.553 --> 34:17.723
I never seen anything like it.
Came from the northeast point.

34:17.756 --> 34:19.691
The lake?

34:19.725 --> 34:21.260
Yeah, it looked that way.

34:21.293 --> 34:23.195
You know, right from the spot
where Nicole...

34:23.229 --> 34:24.696
You know, where...

34:24.730 --> 34:27.933
Oh. I'm-I'm sorry, Andy.
I... I didn't mean to...

34:27.966 --> 34:30.702
Would you... would you mind
staying here for a few minutes?

34:30.736 --> 34:32.704
My youngest is upstairs.

34:32.738 --> 34:34.706
Yeah, sure thing.

34:34.740 --> 34:36.742
Thank you.

34:44.983 --> 34:46.418
Shelby!

34:46.452 --> 34:49.321
Get out of there now!

34:50.589 --> 34:52.391
What the hell are you doing?

34:52.424 --> 34:54.260
I'm asking God for help.

34:54.293 --> 34:57.095
You had to come here?

34:57.129 --> 34:59.831
Andy, whatever's going on
on this island--

34:59.865 --> 35:02.067
this is where it's strongest.

35:02.100 --> 35:04.603
This is where it killed Nicole.

35:06.037 --> 35:08.340
You listen to me.

35:08.374 --> 35:10.776
Nicole killed herself
because she was depressed,

35:10.809 --> 35:12.578
and she needed help.

35:12.611 --> 35:14.613
I didn't give it to her
because I couldn't see

35:14.646 --> 35:16.682
how much she was hurting,
so that is on me.

35:16.715 --> 35:18.584
No, Andy,
but what if you're wrong?

35:18.617 --> 35:20.652
All right? What-what if
it's the same thing

35:20.686 --> 35:22.621
-that almost happened to Caleb?
-Stop it.

35:22.654 --> 35:24.190
Stop it!

35:24.223 --> 35:26.692
I respect that you believe
in something.

35:26.725 --> 35:28.927
I can go along with just about
anything, but not about this.

35:28.960 --> 35:30.796
Not about my wife.

35:33.165 --> 35:34.933
Andy?

35:34.966 --> 35:38.604
Come on. Let's go home.

35:38.637 --> 35:40.206
-(groans)
-Shh, shh, shh, shh.

35:40.239 --> 35:41.940
It won't be long.

35:41.973 --> 35:44.376
You're gonna be clean again.

35:45.644 --> 35:47.145
Come on, move.

35:47.179 --> 35:48.480
Listen to me.

35:48.514 --> 35:51.450
-You are clean. You are pure.
-Marcus, what...

35:51.483 --> 35:53.485
-(whimpers)
-You are a child of God,

35:53.519 --> 35:57.823
-and there is nothing wrong with
you. -Why are you saying that?

35:57.856 --> 36:00.326
You lied to us. She's been
in and out of hospitals

36:00.359 --> 36:01.727
since the day she was born.

36:01.760 --> 36:03.462
-Hallucinogens
to give her visions. -(gasps)

36:03.495 --> 36:05.130
PCP to generate the fits,

36:05.163 --> 36:08.567
emetine to induce vomiting,
stories about a little toad

36:08.600 --> 36:09.901
that lives behind her tongue,

36:09.935 --> 36:11.637
pounding into her head
that she was possessed!

36:11.670 --> 36:14.306
-You're-you're out of your mind.
-She did that drawing

36:14.340 --> 36:15.741
of us herself
while we were upstairs.

36:15.774 --> 36:17.876
She used her own fingernails
to fake the bite marks.

36:17.909 --> 36:19.711
You weren't reading Chris
MacNeil's book for comfort.

36:19.745 --> 36:22.481
You were using it
as a bloody instruction manual!

36:22.514 --> 36:26.318
I want you out of my house!
Both of you! (panting)

36:26.352 --> 36:28.320
We're not going anywhere.

36:28.354 --> 36:30.922
(panting)

36:34.760 --> 36:36.328
You're okay.

36:36.362 --> 36:38.764
Mrs. Graham?

37:08.226 --> 37:10.396
(Lorraine yells)

37:18.470 --> 37:20.138
-(panting)
-You're safe now.

37:20.171 --> 37:22.608
-(gasps)
-Do you understand?

37:24.943 --> 37:27.713
-No, I'm sick.
-No.

37:27.746 --> 37:31.049
No, you are not the sick one.

37:31.082 --> 37:33.051
Your mum's the sick one.

37:33.084 --> 37:34.920
You've done nothing wrong.

37:37.289 --> 37:39.758
It hurts. (groans)

37:39.791 --> 37:41.560
I know.

37:41.593 --> 37:44.262
I know it does, sweetheart.

37:44.296 --> 37:46.965
And it's gonna carry on hurting
for a long time.

37:46.998 --> 37:49.735
You're gonna look at other kids,
other parents,

37:49.768 --> 37:52.904
and you're gonna say, "Why me?

37:52.938 --> 37:55.774
Why can't I have
their life instead?"

37:58.977 --> 38:02.414
And then...

38:02.448 --> 38:04.950
you'll get better.

38:06.652 --> 38:09.421
You'll come out the other side.

38:09.455 --> 38:12.290
You'll be stronger
than you were before.

38:12.324 --> 38:17.028
'Cause you will know
exactly who you are.

38:17.062 --> 38:19.531
That's what survivors do.

38:22.233 --> 38:24.536
Mom?

38:24.570 --> 38:27.038
Get away from her.

38:27.072 --> 38:29.007
You don't understand.

38:29.040 --> 38:32.978
You don't know what she's like,
the things she says.

38:33.011 --> 38:34.513
(gasps sharply)

38:34.546 --> 38:36.782
I am trying to save her.

38:36.815 --> 38:39.618
Close your eyes and don't open
them, no matter what you hear.

38:39.651 --> 38:43.789
Why doesn't anybody understand?

38:43.822 --> 38:45.824
(yells)

38:50.328 --> 38:52.664
(Harper screams)

38:56.034 --> 38:57.903
(Lorraine yells)

38:57.936 --> 38:59.438
(Marcus groans)

39:04.342 --> 39:06.845
(yelling)
No!

39:06.878 --> 39:10.215
(Lorraine screaming
and whimpering)

39:10.248 --> 39:12.317
LORRAINE:
No! No!

39:12.350 --> 39:14.953
(siren wailing)

39:17.355 --> 39:18.790
This way.

39:45.551 --> 39:47.886
Do this long enough,

39:47.919 --> 39:51.423
you think you understand evil
in all its forms,

39:51.457 --> 39:55.393
every face that it wears.

39:55.427 --> 39:57.896
Then something like this
comes along.

39:59.565 --> 40:03.201
Least with a demon,
you know where you stand.

40:03.234 --> 40:05.771
There's a...

40:05.804 --> 40:10.542
purity to the design, a...

40:10.576 --> 40:13.645
a logic, a form.

40:15.914 --> 40:20.719
But a parent who did that
to their own child...

40:20.752 --> 40:24.055
makes you wonder what the hell
you're even trying to save.

40:24.089 --> 40:26.925
I was wrong.

40:26.958 --> 40:28.894
Which bit?

40:28.927 --> 40:31.129
My vision.

40:34.933 --> 40:37.669
If we had gone forward
with the exorcism...

40:43.441 --> 40:46.144
...that girl would have died.

40:48.113 --> 40:51.149
More than likely.

40:55.654 --> 40:57.956
But I was so sure.

41:03.028 --> 41:05.463
(sighs)

41:06.464 --> 41:09.167
I'm not ready to do this
on my own.

41:09.200 --> 41:11.970
Good thing I'm here then.

41:16.341 --> 41:17.809
(laughs softly)

41:20.478 --> 41:22.213
How is she?

41:22.247 --> 41:25.951
It'll take days for the drugs
to flush out from her body,

41:25.984 --> 41:29.521
but she'll recover,
physically, at least.

41:29.555 --> 41:31.890
And then?

41:31.923 --> 41:34.960
Well, when she leaves here,
she'll be placed in the system

41:34.993 --> 41:37.195
while the state builds a case
against her mother.

41:37.228 --> 41:39.230
Shouldn't be too difficult.

41:39.264 --> 41:41.199
Well, you made it easier.

41:41.232 --> 41:44.703
-And what's next for her?
-Finding her a permanent home.

41:44.736 --> 41:48.707
But the system is strained,
so it won't happen fast.

41:51.342 --> 41:54.179
Although, I know of a place

41:54.212 --> 41:57.849
that could probably take her in
in the meantime.

41:57.883 --> 42:01.687
I think she'd be safe there.

42:10.696 --> 42:13.732
(overlapping chatter on phone)

42:13.765 --> 42:15.366
My only white shirt,
so that would be really sad.

42:15.400 --> 42:17.703
-Can you pass the lemonade?
-Do you have anything to drink?

42:20.438 --> 42:22.874
(keys jingling)

42:38.289 --> 42:41.059
I thought we were
meeting your source.

42:41.092 --> 42:43.561
We are.

42:49.735 --> 42:52.671
You've heard of Dolores Navarro?

42:55.974 --> 42:59.544
An exorcist.
She's been missing for months.

42:59.577 --> 43:02.047
I assumed she was dead.

43:02.080 --> 43:05.751
They're not killing exorcists,
Father Bennett.

43:05.784 --> 43:08.586
They're doing something
much worse.

43:12.824 --> 43:16.594
* For the Bible tells me so

43:16.628 --> 43:20.298
* Little ones to Him belong...

43:20.331 --> 43:23.034
Meet Sister Dolores.

43:24.936 --> 43:27.438
Or what's left of her.

43:27.472 --> 43:30.575
* Yes, Jesus loves me!

43:30.608 --> 43:32.143

Captioned by
Media Access Group at WGBH

44:15.153 --> 44:17.122
Now that you're good and scared
by The Exorcist,

44:17.155 --> 44:19.490
here are a few more shows
to check out from Fox.

44:22.994 --> 44:25.630
* Hey-ay-ay *

44:25.663 --> 44:28.499
* Hey-ay-ay *

44:28.533 --> 44:30.535
WOMAN:
This is our story.

44:30.568 --> 44:32.838
* Can't stop me now *

44:32.871 --> 44:34.906
* Can't stop me now *

44:34.940 --> 44:36.975
* I'm just doing what I do *

44:37.008 --> 44:38.476
* Won't stop doing what I do *

44:38.509 --> 44:40.011
* Can't stop me now *

44:40.045 --> 44:43.014
-* Can't stop me now *
-* Can't stop me now *

44:43.048 --> 44:45.316
-* Cannot beat me *
-* Can't stop me now *

44:45.350 --> 44:46.918
* I'm just doin' what I do *

44:46.952 --> 44:49.220
* Won't stop doin' what I do *
