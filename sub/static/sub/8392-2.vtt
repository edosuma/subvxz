WEBVTT

00:00.720 --> 00:02.130
- BUT I THINK HE LIKES YOU,

00:02.240 --> 00:03.229
SO MAYBE IT'S NOT
A BAD THING AT ALL.

00:03.340 --> 00:05.308
- THE LA'I'I'E GIRL AT WORK
IS PREGNANT,

00:05.410 --> 00:08.231
AND I WANNA REALLY ASK HER
IF I CAN BUY HER BABY.

00:08.350 --> 00:09.794
- I THINK I MIGHT HAVE
FOUND A PLACE.

00:09.900 --> 00:11.037
- AMBER'S MOVING OUT?

00:11.140 --> 00:13.005
- WE SHOULD LOOK INTO
MAINSTREAMING MAX NEXT YEAR.

00:13.110 --> 00:14.338
- ALL RIGHT.

00:14.460 --> 00:16.348
- WE SHOULD GO INTO BUSINESS
TOGETHER, YOU AND ME.

00:16.460 --> 00:17.381
BELIEVE ME,
WHEN YOU SEE THIS PLACE,

00:17.500 --> 00:18.489
YOU'RE GONNA KNOW WHAT
I'M TAKING ABOUT.

00:18.600 --> 00:19.521
I WANNA DO THIS.

00:19.640 --> 00:21.358
AND I DON'T WANNA DO IT
WITHOUT YOU.

00:21.460 --> 00:24.349
- THE PARENTS OF THE KID THAT
YOU HIT INTEND TO PRESS CHARGES.

00:24.470 --> 00:26.563
- IT'S NOT MY FIRST OFFENSE.

00:26.680 --> 00:30.468
- IS IT REALLY
THAT MUCH SWEETER

00:30.580 --> 00:34.437
ON THE OTHER END
OF THAT RECEIVER

00:34.550 --> 00:39.237
THERE'S NO NEED
TO CONVERT A BELIEVER

00:39.340 --> 00:42.969
I'M ALREADY YOURS

00:43.070 --> 00:43.968
- IT'S GONNA BE SO GREAT.

00:44.070 --> 00:44.968
- NOW MAX,
IF YOU FEEL LIKE

00:45.070 --> 00:46.037
YOU WANNA MAKE
A COMMENT IN CLASS,

00:46.140 --> 00:47.107
YOU GOT TO REMEMBER
TO RAISE YOUR HAND

00:47.210 --> 00:47.869
AND WAIT FOR THE TEACHER
TO CALL ON YOU, OKAY?

00:47.970 --> 00:49.528
SHE WILL.
- YEAH, ABSOLUTELY.

00:49.630 --> 00:51.382
AND IF YOU WANNA INTRODUCE
YOURSELF AND SAY,

00:51.490 --> 00:53.310
"HI, I'M MAX BRAVERMAN,"
YOU KNOW, TO MEET THE KIDS,

00:53.430 --> 00:54.909
I'M SURE THERE'S
SO MANY NICE KIDS HERE.

00:55.020 --> 00:56.351
- YEAH, AND IF YOU
SMILE A LITTLE BIT,

00:56.470 --> 00:58.358
THAT'LL HELP THEM KNOW
THAT YOU WANNA BE THEIR FRIEND.

00:58.470 --> 01:00.051
- YEAH. LOOK THEM IN THE EYE.
- LOOK RIGHT THEM IN THE EYE.

01:00.160 --> 01:01.297
- OKAY, I GOT IT.
LOOK THEM IN THE EYE.

01:01.400 --> 01:02.469
A SMILE WILL HELP,
I'M MAX BRAVERMAN.

01:02.570 --> 01:03.844
DON'T CORRECT PEOPLE.
- YUP. A-AND TRY NOT TO

01:03.960 --> 01:05.188
CORRECT YOUR TEACHER.

01:05.300 --> 01:06.471
- IT'S GONNA BE
SO MUCH BETTER THAN FOOTPATH.

01:06.580 --> 01:08.024
- WHY IS THAT?
- OH, BECAUSE AT FOOTPATH,

01:08.130 --> 01:09.301
WE CAN ONLY HAVE
ICE CREAM ONCE A WEEK.

01:09.410 --> 01:10.752
HERE,
WE HAVE IT EVERY DAY.

01:10.860 --> 01:12.066
- AH-HA!
THAT'S RIGHT.

01:12.170 --> 01:14.309
- OH, HEY, LOOK WHO IT IS.
THE BRAVERMANS.

01:14.410 --> 01:15.547
- HI!
- FIRST DAY OF SCHOOL.

01:15.660 --> 01:16.752
ARE YOU SO EXCITED?

01:16.860 --> 01:18.964
- HAS YOUR BABY BEEN KICKING?
- A LITTLE BIT.

01:19.070 --> 01:21.277
- GOOD LUCK, SYD.
- HAVE A GREAT MORNING.

01:21.390 --> 01:22.243
- BYE, JABBAR.
- BYE.

01:22.350 --> 01:23.282
- BYE.
- BYE.

01:23.390 --> 01:25.278
- BYE, GUYS.
- BYE, MAX.

01:25.390 --> 01:27.449
- BYE, DAD.
- BYE, DAD.

01:27.570 --> 01:30.391
- WOW.
THAT'S PRETTY COOL, HUH?

01:34.470 --> 01:36.256
- OKAY.

01:36.370 --> 01:37.678
LET'S SEE.
UM...

01:37.780 --> 01:38.769
THE FRENCH ROAST.

01:38.890 --> 01:40.369
- AGAIN?
- YES.

01:40.470 --> 01:42.119
- WHAT DO YOU HAVE,
A NIGHT JOB OR SOMETHING?

01:42.240 --> 01:43.468
- NO, I JUST LIKE COFFEE.

01:43.580 --> 01:47.095
LOTS OF COFFEE.
ALL KINDS OF COFFEE.

01:47.210 --> 01:50.919
- HEY, CAN I ASK YOU
A-A LEGAL QUESTION?

01:51.040 --> 01:53.099
- SURE.

01:53.210 --> 01:54.177
- UM, IT'S JUST--

01:54.280 --> 01:56.657
YOU KNOW WHAT,
FORGET ABOUT IT.

01:56.770 --> 01:58.214
I KNOW THAT YOU'RE BUSY AND...
- NO, NO.

01:58.320 --> 01:59.628
- AND I'M JUST LIKE...
- IT'S FINE.

01:59.740 --> 02:01.970
- I CAN'T, I'M SORRY.
- ZOE. I SAID YES.

02:02.080 --> 02:03.001
WHAT'S UP?

02:03.120 --> 02:04.041
- ALL RIGHT, SO,

02:04.150 --> 02:06.323
MY LANDLORD TOLD ME THAT

02:06.430 --> 02:08.352
I HAVE TO MOVE
OUT OF MY APARTMENT.

02:08.470 --> 02:10.017
BUT THE THING IS I THINK
HE WANTS TO JUST MOVE

02:10.130 --> 02:12.462
HIS GIRLFRIEND'S BUDDY
INTO THE BUILDING.

02:12.580 --> 02:13.148
- NOT COOL.

02:13.270 --> 02:14.919
- RIGHT?
- YEAH.

02:15.030 --> 02:15.883
- I KNEW THAT WASN'T COOL.

02:15.990 --> 02:16.911
- IT'S NOT COOL.

02:17.030 --> 02:18.816
- COOL.
- SUPER UNCOOL.

02:18.930 --> 02:20.989
- COOL.

02:21.100 --> 02:22.544
- COOL. WELL, UM, YEAH.
I CAN JUST DRAFT

02:22.650 --> 02:24.231
A CEASE AND DESIST LETTER
FOR YOU.

02:24.350 --> 02:26.659
I CAN DEFINITELY HELP YOU
WITH THAT.

02:26.760 --> 02:28.648
- FOR REAL?
- YEAH.

02:28.760 --> 02:30.239
- NO, IT'S--YOU KNOW,
I DON'T HAVE--

02:30.350 --> 02:31.829
I DON'T HAVE THE MONEY
TO PAY FOR THAT.

02:31.940 --> 02:32.793
SO DON'T WORRY IT.
FORGET I...

02:32.910 --> 02:33.979
- DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

02:34.080 --> 02:35.240
- I DON'T HAVE
THE MONEY FOR THAT.

02:35.360 --> 02:36.975
- NOT A PROBLEM.
- I CAN MAKE PAYMENTS.

02:37.080 --> 02:38.286
IT'S TOTALLY FINE.
I CAN PAY YOU.

02:38.390 --> 02:39.630
- ZOE, DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.
- I'LL PAY YOU.

02:42.300 --> 02:43.676
IT'S MY PLEASURE.

02:45.470 --> 02:47.358
- ALL RIGHT.
COOL.

02:50.200 --> 02:51.747
- IF YOU STICK
TO YOUR INITIAL INVESTMENT,

02:51.860 --> 02:54.306
AND IF THE FIRST THREE MONTHS
ARE SECURED BY THE ARTISTS

02:54.410 --> 02:55.752
YOU SAY ARE GONNA
FOLLOW YOU TO THIS SPACE,

02:55.860 --> 02:59.819
YOU, MY FRIEND, COULD BE TURNING
A PROFIT BY MONTH FOUR.

02:59.930 --> 03:01.795
BUT YOU GOTTA STICK TO THAT.

03:01.900 --> 03:04.551
THIS PLACE HAS TO LIVE UP TO
WHAT YOU'RE PROMISING IT TO BE.

03:04.660 --> 03:08.141
AND HONESTLY, YOU KNOW, LOOKING
AROUND, IT'S PRETTY UNIQUE.

03:08.250 --> 03:10.002
AND I THINK THE IDEA OF A

03:10.120 --> 03:12.008
BOUTIQUE UPSCALE
RECORDING STUDIO

03:12.120 --> 03:14.111
IS NOT THE WORST IDEA
YOU'VE EVER HAVE.

03:14.220 --> 03:15.903
- THAT'S AWESOME.

03:16.020 --> 03:18.079
THANK YOU, AND I DON'T EVEN
UNDERSTAND ALL THIS.

03:18.190 --> 03:20.294
BUT THIS IS AMAZING.

03:20.400 --> 03:23.153
SO WE'RE GONNA DO THIS?

03:23.270 --> 03:26.194
- YOU ARE.
I CAN'T DO THIS WITH YOU.

03:26.300 --> 03:27.642
- WELL, WAIT.
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

03:27.750 --> 03:29.786
YOU'RE SAYING IT'S...
- LISTEN, I THOUGHT ABOUT IT.

03:29.890 --> 03:32.165
BUT I HAVE A REAL OFFER
ON THE TABLE RIGHT NOW.

03:32.280 --> 03:34.100
- SELLING ROOT BEER?
- YEAH.

03:34.210 --> 03:36.132
AND OTHER SODA AND BEER.

03:36.250 --> 03:37.729
- COME ON, ADAM.

03:37.830 --> 03:39.479
- LOOK, IT'S A REAL OFFER,
CROSBY.

03:39.590 --> 03:41.103
I CAN'T PASS IT UP.
I'VE GOT A HOUSE, I'VE GOT KIDS.

03:41.220 --> 03:43.381
I CAN'T RISK THIS.
- YEAH, I HAVE THAT TOO.

03:43.490 --> 03:45.663
- LISTEN, I THINK THIS IS
A REALLY INTERESTING IDEA.

03:45.770 --> 03:47.419
I HOPE YOU DO IT, AND I HOPE
IT WORKS OUT FOR YOU,

03:47.530 --> 03:49.976
BUT I CAN'T DO IT WITH YOU.

03:50.090 --> 03:51.250
I CAN'T.

03:57.580 --> 04:00.856
- I WON'T ASK ANYONE
TO STAND ON THEIR DESK.

04:00.960 --> 04:02.120
[laughter]
UM...

04:02.240 --> 04:03.502
AND THEN WE'RE GOING
INTO THE ROMANTICS.

04:03.620 --> 04:06.373
REST ASSURED, I WILL NOT
MAKE IT TOO ROMANTIC.

04:06.480 --> 04:08.448
THEY DON'T NEED ANY HELP
IN THAT DEPARTMENT.

04:08.550 --> 04:10.723
I EXPECT A LOT FROM YOUR KIDS,
AND I WANT THEM TO WORK HARD,

04:10.830 --> 04:13.310
BUT I ALSO WANT THEM
TO HAVE FUN.

04:13.420 --> 04:14.694
I GET THEM FOR NINE MONTHS,

04:14.800 --> 04:16.836
AND I WANT THEM TO LOOK BACK
ON IT WITH FUN.

04:16.940 --> 04:18.760
IT'S BECAUSE AS MY CLOSE,
PERSONAL FRIEND

04:18.870 --> 04:23.284
EMILY DICKINSON SAID,
"THAT IT WILL NEVER...

04:23.400 --> 04:25.049
"COME AGAIN

04:25.160 --> 04:28.254
IS WHAT MAKES LIFE SO SWEET."

04:28.370 --> 04:30.122
AND, UM...

04:30.230 --> 04:31.913
- THIS IS TOTALLY EMBARRASSING,
BUT IT'S JUST LIKE...

04:32.030 --> 04:33.361
- NO.
- IF WE DON'T DO IT NOW,

04:33.480 --> 04:35.505
I FEEL LIKE IT COULD BE MORE...
- THIS IS A GOOD IDEA.

04:35.620 --> 04:36.951
- AWKWARD LATER.
- YOU'RE RIGHT.

04:37.060 --> 04:38.197
- IF YOU CAN IMAGINE.
I MEAN, WHO WOULD KNOW,

04:38.310 --> 04:39.538
YOU KNOW,
WHO WOULD'VE KNOWN

04:39.650 --> 04:41.959
THAT IT WOULD BE
EMILY DICKINSON WHO WOULD REALLY

04:42.070 --> 04:44.345
[laughing]
MAKE ME FEEL HOT?

04:44.450 --> 04:45.656
- I'M SURPRISED AT THAT TOO.

04:45.760 --> 04:47.341
'CAUSE SHE...
SHE DIED A VIRGIN.

04:47.450 --> 04:48.269
I DON'T KNOW WHY I SAID THAT.

04:48.390 --> 04:50.790
PLEASE DON'T ASK...
- [glggleS]

04:54.250 --> 04:56.662
- MAY GOD BLESS
AND KEEP YOU ALWAYS

04:56.770 --> 04:59.216
MAY YOUR WISHES
ALL COME TRUE

04:59.330 --> 05:03.869
MAY YOU ALWAYS DO FOR OTHERS
AND LET OTHERS DO FOR YOU

05:03.990 --> 05:06.504
MAY YOU BUILD A LADDER
TO THE STARS

05:06.610 --> 05:08.407
AND CLIMB ON EVERY RUNG

05:08.510 --> 05:13.538
AND MAY YOU STAY
FOREVER YOUNG

05:13.650 --> 05:15.538
MAY YOU GROW UP
TO BE RIGHTEOUS

05:15.660 --> 05:18.515
MAY YOU GROW UP TO BE TRUE

05:18.620 --> 05:20.861
MAY YOU ALWAYS KNOW
THE TRUTH

05:20.970 --> 05:23.279
AND SEE THE LIGHTS
SURROUNDING YOU

05:23.390 --> 05:25.597
MAY YOU ALWAYS BE COURAGEOUS

05:25.700 --> 05:28.112
STAND UPRIGHT AND BE STRONG

05:28.220 --> 05:32.702
MAY YOU STAY FOREVER YOUNG

05:32.810 --> 05:37.497
MAY YOU STAY FOREVER YOUNG

05:49.170 --> 05:50.751
- HI.

05:52.070 --> 05:53.344
- HI.

05:55.320 --> 06:00.007
I DON'T THINK WE SHOULD
DO THAT AGAIN.

06:00.110 --> 06:03.762
IT DIDN'T--IT JUST DIDN'T
FEEL GOOD, YOU KNOW.

06:03.880 --> 06:06.451
- YEAH, I DON'T WANT--
I JUST DON'T WANT TO.

06:06.570 --> 06:07.594
- ISN'T IT?
YOU SHOULDN'T FEEL BAD.

06:07.710 --> 06:08.938
- YEAH. NO, I'M--
- IT'S JUST THAT

06:09.050 --> 06:10.187
I DON'T HAVE THAT,
YOU KNOW, CONNECTION.

06:10.300 --> 06:11.437
- I'M THE WORST.
I KNOW.

06:11.540 --> 06:12.939
- NO, NO, NO.
- I KNOW.

06:13.060 --> 06:14.152
- IT'S ME.

06:14.270 --> 06:17.023
- YEAH, IT WAS--THERE WAS
A LITTLE BIT OF YOU IN THERE.

06:17.130 --> 06:18.711
- SARAH, HEY.

06:18.820 --> 06:20.264
- [gas
- [whist'ﬁi'g]

06:20.380 --> 06:21.267
- COME ON SARAH.
AH-HAH.

06:21.380 --> 06:22.404
- THAT'S MY DAD.
- REALLY?

06:22.520 --> 06:23.589
- SARAH,
COME ON OUT.

06:23.690 --> 06:25.089
- IT'S MY DAD.
GO HIDE, HIDE, HIDE.

06:25.210 --> 06:27.064
- WHAT DO I DO?
WHAT DO I DO?

06:27.170 --> 06:28.580
- I'M--I'M COMING,
I'M COMING.

06:28.690 --> 06:29.588
- WHAT'S GOING ON IN THERE?

06:29.690 --> 06:30.861
- NOTHING.
HOLD ON.

06:30.970 --> 06:32.346
- OKAY, HOLDING.

06:32.460 --> 06:33.859
OH, THERE'S SOMETHING
YOU DON'T SEE EVERY DAY.

06:33.970 --> 06:35.414
I'M NOT COMING IN.

06:35.530 --> 06:37.145
NO WAY AM I COMING IN.

06:37.250 --> 06:38.285
- HI.
- HI.

06:38.390 --> 06:39.630
TREATS.

06:39.740 --> 06:42.322
FOR YOUR
LITTLE SLEEPOVER CELEBRATION.

06:42.430 --> 06:43.249
- OH, MY GOD.
- YEAH.

06:43.360 --> 06:44.679
- GET OUT.

06:44.780 --> 06:46.395
- I BROUGHT A CUP
FOR YOUR LITTLE FRIEND THERE.

06:46.500 --> 06:48.127
- I SEE THAT.
- YOUR BED BUDDY.

06:48.230 --> 06:50.289
HEY, I DIDN'T GET ANY CREAM.
YOU LIKE CREAM?

06:50.410 --> 06:52.219
HEY!

06:52.340 --> 06:53.329
- I'M NOT--NO SIR.
NO, THANK YOU, SIR.

06:53.440 --> 06:56.022
- HE'S VERY WHITE.
- WHAT?

06:56.130 --> 06:57.574
- HE DOESN'T HAVE A TAN.

06:57.690 --> 06:59.169
- DAD, GET OUT OF HERE.
- KIND OF SKINNY.

06:59.280 --> 07:00.201
- OH, MY GOD.

07:00.310 --> 07:01.379
- THIS IS ME LEAVING.

07:01.490 --> 07:03.173
- ARE YOU UNDER THERE?
ARE YOU OKAY?

07:03.280 --> 07:04.247
- YEAH.

07:04.350 --> 07:05.658
- YOU TOTALLY DIDN'T
HAVE TO HIDE IT.

07:05.770 --> 07:07.488
IT'S JUST AN OLD REFLEX,
YOU KNOW.

07:07.590 --> 07:09.410
- THAT WAS
A P-PROUD MOMENT FOR ME.

07:09.530 --> 07:10.383
I FEEL LIKE THAT'S
A RIGHT OF PASSAGE.

07:10.490 --> 07:12.663
- YOU WERE FAST, MAN,
YOU WERE LIKE...

07:12.770 --> 07:14.044
- I WAS--I DIDN'T KNOW
I'D BE SCARED.

07:14.150 --> 07:15.117
- YOU'VE RUN BEFORE.

07:15.220 --> 07:18.087
- [laughter]
I HAVE RUN BEFORE.

07:24.580 --> 07:25.911
- HI, HONEY.

07:26.030 --> 07:27.509
- MORNING.

07:27.610 --> 07:29.783
- YOU'RE UP EARLY.

07:29.890 --> 07:30.811
- YUP.

07:30.930 --> 07:31.851
- MM-HMM.

07:31.960 --> 07:33.780
WHAT YOU DOIN'?

07:33.900 --> 07:38.963
- I AM THINKING ABOUT WHAT
IF I DON'T TAKE THIS JOB.

07:41.010 --> 07:42.864
- I THOUGHT YOU SAID
THAT YOU WERE GOING TO?

07:42.970 --> 07:46.519
- I JUST KEEP TURNING
IT OVER IN MY HEAD, I--

07:46.630 --> 07:47.699
BEVERAGE DISTRIBUTION.

07:47.810 --> 07:49.493
- I'D BUY A BEVERAGE FROM YOU.

07:49.600 --> 07:53.354
- IT'S JUST NOT A VERY INSPIRED
CAREER CHOICE.

07:53.470 --> 07:54.983
- I KNOW IT'S JUST UNTIL
YOU FIND SOMETHING

07:55.090 --> 07:57.775
A LITTLE MORE
INSPIRING, THAT'S ALL.

07:57.890 --> 07:58.879
- THAT'S TRUE.
THAT'S A GOOD POINT.

07:58.990 --> 08:01.788
I HAVE TO LET THEM KNOW
BY WEDNESDAY.

08:01.890 --> 08:03.687
- OKAY.

08:03.790 --> 08:07.612
WHATEVER YOU WANNA DO.

08:07.720 --> 08:12.066
- NO, I SHOULD DO IT.
I SHOULD TAKE IT.

08:12.180 --> 08:13.898
- SO, ALEX, THIS GUY'S NAME
IS CRAIG DAVID.

08:14.010 --> 08:16.763
HE'S A VERY COMPETENT YOUNG
ATTORNEY

08:16.870 --> 08:18.098
WHO DOES PRO BONO WORK
FOR HIS FIRM.

08:18.220 --> 08:21.735
SO I TALKED HIM ABOUT YOUR CASE,
AND HE SAID TO CALL HIM.

08:21.840 --> 08:23.148
- WAIT, SO YOU CAN'T HELP?

08:23.260 --> 08:25.012
I THOUGHT YOU WOULD BE ABLE
TO DO THIS?

08:25.120 --> 08:28.988
- I DON'T--I DON'T PRACTICE
CRIMINAL LAW.

08:29.090 --> 08:32.776
BUT, UM--YOU KNOW.

08:32.890 --> 08:34.539
HE'S GREAT,
AND I WILL BE THERE.

08:34.650 --> 08:36.572
IT'S JUST THAT THE PARENTS
ARE PRESSING CHARGES

08:36.680 --> 08:37.920
FOR ASSAULT AND BATTERY,

08:38.030 --> 08:40.749
AND THAT'S JUST NOT MY AREA
OF EXPERTISE.

08:40.860 --> 08:41.952
- YEAH, I GET IT.

08:42.070 --> 08:45.722

08:48.630 --> 08:50.416
THANK YOU SO MUCH
FOR--FOR THIS.

08:50.530 --> 08:51.758
HADDIE, I SHOULD PROBABLY

IS THIS REALLY SERIOUS?

09:08.340 --> 09:11.787
- YEAH, IT'S KIND OF SERIOUS.

09:11.890 --> 09:14.882
- OKAY.
COULD HE GO TO JAIL?

09:15.000 --> 09:17.889
- POSSIBLY.

09:18.000 --> 09:19.683
- OKAY.

09:19.800 --> 09:24.316
- HAVE YOU TALKED
TO YOUR PARENTS ABOUT THIS?

09:24.420 --> 09:25.387
AS SOON AS YOU CAN.

09:25.490 --> 09:27.902
- RIGHT, YEAH I KNOW.
OKAY.

THANK YOU.

09:43.230 --> 09:44.128
- I'M NOT.

09:44.230 --> 09:45.367
- YES, YOU ARE.

09:45.480 --> 09:46.367
- CAN YOU PLEASE RAISE YOUR HAND

09:46.480 --> 09:47.504
IF YOU WANNA SAY SOMETHING?

09:47.620 --> 09:48.757
- SHE'S WRITING IN HER BOOK,

09:48.860 --> 09:49.884
AND SHE'S NOT
SUPPOSED TO DO THAT.

09:50.000 --> 09:50.853
- NO, I'M NOT.
I'M NOT WRITING IN MY BOOK.

09:50.960 --> 09:52.689
- OKAY. OKAY SWEETIE.
- YES, YOU ARE.

09:52.790 --> 09:53.654
AND YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO,
BECAUSE IT'S IN THE RULES.

09:53.760 --> 09:54.795
- NO, I'M NOT.
- OKAY, MAX.

09:54.900 --> 09:56.891
LISTEN, WE'LL DEAL
WITH THIS LATER.

09:57.010 --> 10:00.138
IT'S ALSO IN THE RULES THAT
YOU DON'T TALK OUT IN CLASS.

10:00.250 --> 10:02.241
RIGHT MAX?

10:03.600 --> 10:04.737

10:04.840 --> 10:05.807
SO LET'S TALK
ABOUT THE MISSIONS.

10:05.910 --> 10:07.286
- FREAK.

10:07.390 --> 10:09.802
- DOES ANYBODY KNOW
HOW MANY MISSIONS THERE WERE?

10:09.910 --> 10:10.877
- 21.

10:10.980 --> 10:12.538
AND THERE STILL ARE 21.
IT'S NOT PAST.

10:12.640 --> 10:13.868
- THAT'S THE CORRECT ANSWER.

10:13.990 --> 10:15.434
BUT CAN YOU RAISE YOUR HAND,
PLEASE,

10:15.540 --> 10:17.815
BEFORE YOU GIVE THE ANSWER?

10:17.920 --> 10:20.093
WHAT IS THE NAME OF THE MAN
WHO STARTED THE MISSIONS?

10:20.200 --> 10:21.121
YES?

10:21.240 --> 10:22.127
- FATHER SERRA.

10:22.240 --> 10:22.990
- FATHER JUNIPERO SERRA.

10:23.100 --> 10:24.328
- VERY GOOD.
- SHE WAS WRONG.

10:24.450 --> 10:25.826
THERE COULD BE PLENTY OF PEOPLE

10:25.930 --> 10:28.103
WHOSE LAST NAMES WERE SERRA
AND WERE ALSO PRIESTS.

10:28.210 --> 10:29.654
- BUT THERE PROBABLY WEREN'T TOO
MANY OF THOSE...

10:29.760 --> 10:30.988
- IT WAS A VERY COMMON
LAST NAME.

10:31.110 --> 10:32.691
- OKAY, WHO KNOWS THE NAME OF
THE HIGHWAY THAT THEY WERE ON?

10:32.800 --> 10:33.721
- EL CAMINO REAL.

10:33.840 --> 10:34.761
- THAT'S A CORRECT ANSWER, MAX.

10:34.870 --> 10:37.691
BUT AGAIN, YOU RAISED YOUR HAND.
- YES.

10:37.800 --> 10:40.633
- BUT I NEED TO CALL ON YOU
BEFORE YOU ANSWER.

10:40.740 --> 10:41.809
- SO, YOU SHOULD'VE
SPECIFIED THAT.

10:41.910 --> 10:43.320
YOU JUST SAID
I NEEDED TO RAISE MY HAND.

10:43.430 --> 10:44.215
- I--I DID SPECIFY.
I SAID...

10:44.330 --> 10:45.558
- NO YOU SAID--YOU JUST SAID
RAISE YOUR HAND.

10:45.670 --> 10:46.944
- MAX.

10:47.060 --> 10:48.049
- I DON'T GET WHY WE
HAVE TO RAISE OUR HANDS,

10:48.160 --> 10:49.297
BECAUSE IF YOU WERE IN A
REAL CONVERSATION...

10:49.400 --> 10:50.958
- OKAY, LISTEN, WE'RE GONNA...

10:51.060 --> 10:52.288
- THEN YOU WOULDN'T, LIKE,
RAISE HAND EVERY TIME

10:52.410 --> 10:53.149
YOU WANTED TO CONTRIBUTE
SOMETHING IN THAT CONVERSATION.

10:53.270 --> 10:54.669
YOU WOULD JUST GO...

10:54.790 --> 10:56.121
- MAX BRAVERMAN, WE WILL TALK
ABOUT THIS LATER.

10:56.240 --> 11:01.724
- I WAS DRINKING AT THE PARTY,
AND ALEX CAME TO PICK ME UP.

11:01.830 --> 11:03.969
THERE WAS A MISUNDERSTANDING.

11:04.070 --> 11:08.006
THE GUY, ZACH, WHOSE HOUSE
IT IS, THOUGHT THAT

11:08.110 --> 11:12.353
ALEX WAS BOTHERING ME,
AND HE WAS BEING REALLY RUDE.

11:12.460 --> 11:17.329
HE PUSHED ALEX, SO,
AND IT WAS REALLY MESSY,

11:17.430 --> 11:18.499
AND ALEX PUNCHED HIM.

11:18.600 --> 11:19.806
THEY GOT INTO A FIGHT.

11:19.920 --> 11:21.740
IT WASN'T HUGE.
IT WAS OVER QUICKLY.

11:21.850 --> 11:23.249
IT WAS MY FAULT.

11:23.370 --> 11:25.747
- NO, LISTEN.
I TAKE FULL RESPONSIBILITY.

11:25.850 --> 11:28.296
OKAY, IT WAS FAULT.

11:28.410 --> 11:29.399
I SHOULDN'T HAVE REACTED.

11:29.510 --> 11:32.889
I SHOULDN'T HAVE PUNCHED
THE GUY.

11:33.000 --> 11:34.888
- OKAY, I ACTUALLY DON'T
EVEN KNOW WHAT TO SAY

11:35.000 --> 11:36.991
TO YOU BOTH RIGHT NOW.

11:37.110 --> 11:41.865
- I HAVE TO TELL YOU ALSO
THAT THE FAMILY

11:41.970 --> 11:46.839
IS GONNA PRESS
CHARGES OF ASSAULT AND BATTERY.

11:46.940 --> 11:51.968
- [sighs]
- DO YOU HAVE A LAWYER?

11:54.850 --> 11:56.329
- YEAH.

11:56.430 --> 11:58.773
BUT I DON'T WANT YOU
TO WORRY ABOUT THAT, OKAY?

11:58.890 --> 12:00.016
I'M HANDLING IT.

12:00.130 --> 12:03.099
WE--WE THOUGHT THAT YOU GUYS
NEEDED TO KNOW.

12:17.210 --> 12:20.316
- BUDDY, COME ON.
- I'M AWAKE.

12:20.420 --> 12:24.493
- IT'S TIME TO GET UP FOR
SCHOOL, WE GOTTA GO.

12:24.600 --> 12:29.424
MAX...

12:29.540 --> 12:31.679
ARE YOU EXCITED ABOUT GOING BACK
TO SCHOOL TODAY?

12:31.780 --> 12:36.911
HOW DO YOU FEEL?
- [sighs]

12:37.030 --> 12:39.362
- DO YOU LIKE YOUR TEACHER?
IS SHE NICE?

12:39.480 --> 12:42.608
- I THOUGHT YOU ALREADY ASKED ME
THIS STUFF LAST NIGHT.

12:42.720 --> 12:43.709
- YOU'RE RIGHT.
I KNOW, I DID. I DID.

12:43.830 --> 12:47.300
I'M JUST--JUST WONDERING.

12:47.420 --> 12:50.480
DO YOU LIKE IT
AS MUCH AS FOOTPATH?

12:50.590 --> 12:53.832
- I DON'T KNOW.
IT'S OKAY.

12:53.940 --> 12:56.044
- HOW ABOUT FRIENDS?
HAVE YOU MADE ANY NEW FRIENDS?

12:56.150 --> 12:58.209
I'M SURE THERE WERE
A LOT OF NICE KIDS THERE

12:58.320 --> 13:00.140
THAT ARE JUST LIKE...
- I DON'T KNOW.

13:00.260 --> 13:01.488
- WANTING TO HANG OUT WITH YOU.

13:01.600 --> 13:02.840
- NO, NO.

13:02.950 --> 13:06.363
CAN I HAVE MY BREAKFAST NOW?

13:06.470 --> 13:08.700
- SURE.

13:08.820 --> 13:11.436
I'LL GET YOUR BREAKFAST.

13:14.890 --> 13:19.406
- [knocks on door]

13:19.520 --> 13:20.657
- HEY.

13:20.760 --> 13:21.488
- THIS IS WHY I CAN'T TRUST YOU,
CROSBY.

13:21.590 --> 13:23.558
THIS IS WHY YOU SCARE ME.

13:23.660 --> 13:25.139
- IT'S BECAUSE
OF HOW I'M DRESSED?

13:25.250 --> 13:28.549
- I JUST GOT A CALL FROM SOME
GUY AT MY HOME TELLING ME ABOUT

13:28.660 --> 13:30.799
A MEETING WE'RE HAVING
TOMORROW TO DISCUSS THE LEASE

13:30.910 --> 13:32.457
FOR THE SPACE AND
CALLING ME A PARTNER.

13:32.570 --> 13:33.389
- OH, THAT.

13:33.500 --> 13:34.808
- ALL RIGHT.
I'M NOT YOUR PARTNER, OKAY?

13:34.910 --> 13:37.356
I SPECIFICALLY TOLD YOU,
I CAN'T DO THIS WITH YOU.

13:37.470 --> 13:39.938
- YOU RAN A SUCCESSFUL BUSINESS
FOR 15 YEARS.

13:40.060 --> 13:41.607
IT LOOKS GREAT ON AN
APPLICATION.

13:41.710 --> 13:42.631
IT'S NOT A BIG DEAL.

13:42.750 --> 13:43.535
I JUST GAVE THEM YOUR
WORK HISTORY

13:43.650 --> 13:45.151
AND YOUR SOC--

13:45.270 --> 13:46.714
- WAIT A MINUTE. YOU GAVE THEM
MY SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER?

13:46.820 --> 13:47.957
WHERE DID YOU GET MY SOCIAL
SECURITY NUMBER?

13:48.060 --> 13:49.925
- FROM DAD.
WHERE I ALWAYS GET IT.

13:50.030 --> 13:51.474
- YOU'VE DONE THIS BEFORE?

13:51.580 --> 13:52.308
- OF COURSE, I HAVE.

13:52.410 --> 13:53.479
- I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU'VE DONE THIS.

13:53.590 --> 13:54.989
- LOOK AT YOU.

13:55.110 --> 13:56.441
- THIS IS EXACTLY WHY
I DIDN'T WANT TO GO

13:56.550 --> 13:58.063
INTO BUSINESS WITH YOU.

13:58.180 --> 14:00.273
- OH, WHY? 'CAUSE I'M COMMITTED
TO MAKING THIS THING HAPPEN?

14:00.390 --> 14:02.278
I DON'T WANNA BLOW THIS
OPPORTUNITY, ADAM.

14:02.390 --> 14:03.596
I SEE SOMETHING IN THAT
BUILDING, OKAY?

14:03.700 --> 14:05.349
- MM-HMM.

14:05.460 --> 14:06.688
- IT'S A PLACE WHERE THE PAST
AND THE PRESENT COME TOGETHER

14:06.810 --> 14:08.949
OVER A LUNCH COUNTER IN
HAIGHT-ASHBURY

14:09.050 --> 14:11.462
AND MAGIC CAN HAPPEN THERE.

14:11.570 --> 14:13.424
I JUST NEED YOU TO COME AND MEET
THE LANDLORD WITH ME.

14:13.540 --> 14:15.428
THERE ARE OTHER COMPANIES THAT
WANT THE SPACE,

14:15.540 --> 14:18.509
AND I GOTTA CONVINCE HIM AND
YOU'RE--YOU HAVE THAT THING.

14:18.610 --> 14:19.918
PEOPLE TRUST YOU.

14:20.030 --> 14:20.678
- WELL, THERE'S A REASON WHY
THEY TRUST ME, CROSBY.

14:20.790 --> 14:22.678
I'M TRUSTWORTHY.
- I KNOW THAT.

14:22.790 --> 14:25.543
YOU'VE GOT THAT,
AND-AND I NEED IT.

14:25.650 --> 14:27.709
JUST COME WITH ME AND TALK ABOUT
THE NUMBERS

14:27.830 --> 14:29.138
THAT WAY YOU DID
IN THE PANCAKE HOUSE.

14:29.240 --> 14:30.867
SOMEHOW, YOU MADE
THAT SOUND EXCITING,

14:30.970 --> 14:31.994
AND THEN YOU DON'T HAVE TO HAVE

14:32.110 --> 14:33.589
ANYTHING TO DO WITH IT
EVER AGAIN.

14:33.700 --> 14:35.201
AS SOON AS I GET THE LEASE,

14:35.320 --> 14:39.484
YOUR NAME WILL COME OFF OF IT
AND THAT'LL BE THAT.

14:42.670 --> 14:44.217
- HEY, HONEY.
- YEAH.

14:44.330 --> 14:47.777
- UM, YOU KNOW, HOW I WAS JOKING
ABOUT ASKING THE LATTE GIRL

14:47.880 --> 14:49.086
IF WE COULD HAVE HER BAY?

14:49.190 --> 14:50.396
- [laughs]
YEAH.

14:50.510 --> 14:52.364
- UM, WHAT IF I DID?

14:52.470 --> 14:53.607
- DID WHAT?

14:53.720 --> 14:57.338
- WHAT IF I ASKED HER
IF WE COULD HAVE HER BABY?

14:57.440 --> 14:59.499
SHE TOLD ME SHE DOESN'T WANT IT.
SHE WAS GIVING IT UP.

14:59.620 --> 15:00.951
AND WE DO WANT IT.

15:01.070 --> 15:02.094
- WAIT, WAIT.

15:02.210 --> 15:04.166
WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?

15:04.280 --> 15:05.963
- I'M SAYING I WANT--I WANNA
ASK HER.

15:06.070 --> 15:07.958
- HONEY, YOU CAN'T WALK UP TO
SOMEBODY YOU WORK WITH

15:08.070 --> 15:10.482
AND SAY, "EXCUSE ME, IF YOU
AREN'T USING THAT BABY,

15:10.590 --> 15:11.488
CAN WE HAVE IT?"

15:11.600 --> 15:12.908
- WHY NOT?

15:13.010 --> 15:14.216
- WHY NOT?

15:14.320 --> 15:15.389
OKAY.

15:15.500 --> 15:17.593
HONEY, WE DON'T--WE KNOW NOTHING
ABOUT THIS GIRL.

15:17.700 --> 15:18.564
- I DO.
I KNOW HER.

15:18.670 --> 15:19.523
- OKAY.
HOW?

15:19.640 --> 15:20.561
- SHE'S LOVELY.

15:20.670 --> 15:22.080
- SHE'S LOVELY.
GOOD.

15:22.190 --> 15:25.159
- SHE'S--SHE'S SMART AND
BEAUTIFUL AND SO YOUNG...

15:25.260 --> 15:26.739
- AND GREAT AT MAKING LATTES.

15:26.850 --> 15:28.192
YOU DON'T KNOW GENETIC MAKE-UP.

15:28.300 --> 15:29.608
YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT THIS GIRL
HAS BEEN THROUGH.

15:29.720 --> 15:30.709
SHE COULD BE A CRACK ADDICT...

15:30.820 --> 15:31.889
- SHE'S NOT A CRACK ADDICT.

15:32.000 --> 15:32.989
- WE--WE COULD BE CRACK ADDICT S.

15:33.100 --> 15:34.260
SHE KNOWS NOTHING ABOUT US.

15:34.380 --> 15:35.449
- WELL, YOU CAN MEET HER.
I CAN EASILY ARRANGE THAT.

15:35.550 --> 15:36.471
- NO.

15:36.590 --> 15:37.545
IT'S NOT HOW'S IT DONE.

15:37.660 --> 15:39.616
- WELL, CAN YOU THINK
OUTSIDE THE BOX HERE?

15:39.730 --> 15:41.243
THIS IS FALLING IN OUR LAPS.

15:41.350 --> 15:43.511
- I CAN'T THINK OUTSIDE THE BOX
ON THIS ONE.

15:43.630 --> 15:44.654
- THIS IS--IT'S AN AMAZING
OPPORTUNITY, BABE.

15:44.770 --> 15:45.964
CAN YOU C(NJgSIDER IT?

15:46.080 --> 15:47.832
YOU JUST--YOU JUST CAN'T GO
ROGUE ON ME

15:47.940 --> 15:50.147
AND HAMMER OUT A DEAL
AT THE COFFEE CART.

15:50.250 --> 15:53.139
THAT'S CRAZY, JULIA.

15:55.880 --> 15:58.872
YOU KNOW THAT'S CRAZY,
RIGHT?

15:58.990 --> 16:00.389
WE'RE GOING TO GET A BABY.

16:00.510 --> 16:02.193
WE'RE GONNA GET OUR BABY.
BUT WE'RE GONNA DO IT

16:02.300 --> 16:04.677
THROUGH THE PROPER CHANNELS.

16:04.790 --> 16:06.269
WE'RE GONNA DO IT THE RIGHT WAY,

16:06.370 --> 16:10.750
AND YOU JUST HAVE TO BE
PATIENT HERE.

16:12.830 --> 16:15.890
OKAY?

16:16.000 --> 16:18.139
- OKAY.

16:29.600 --> 16:32.114
- DO YOU HAVE ANYTHING ELSE
TO DO?

16:32.230 --> 16:33.128
- NO, THAT'S WHAT--YEAH,
ACTUALLY

16:33.230 --> 16:35.881
I WAS ABOUT 45 MINUTES EARLY
TONIGHT.

16:35.990 --> 16:38.094
I JUST HID AROUND.

16:38.200 --> 16:39.019
- WHAT?
- THE CORNER.

16:39.130 --> 16:40.506
- YOU DID?

16:40.620 --> 16:41.644
- AND WAITED IN MY CAR UNTIL
IT SEEMED APPROPRIATE--

16:41.750 --> 16:42.614
- YOU WAITED IN THE CAR?

16:42.720 --> 16:43.402
- YEAH.
- OH, NO.

16:43.510 --> 16:44.716
- WELL, I HAVE...

16:44.830 --> 16:45.512
- I HAVE--I HAVE THINGS TO DO.

16:45.620 --> 16:46.689
I WAS LISTENING TO THE RADIO
AND,

16:46.790 --> 16:48.348
- WHAT DID YOU DO?

16:48.450 --> 16:50.338
- YOU KNOW, CAUGHT UP ON CURRENT
EVENTS AND THINGS LIKE THAT.

16:50.450 --> 16:52.315
[laughter]

16:52.420 --> 16:54.149
- I WAS ALWAYS THINK IT RUNS IN
THE FAMILY

16:54.250 --> 16:55.478
SO IT'S NOT MY FAULT,
YOU KNOW.

16:55.600 --> 16:56.385
- TARDINESS?

16:56.490 --> 16:57.969
- ME AND CROSBY,
WE STRUGGLE.

16:58.080 --> 16:59.524
- NOT SO MUCH.
- IT'S NOT OUR FAULT.

16:59.630 --> 17:00.528
- IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT.

17:00.640 --> 17:02.562
MY BROTHER'S ALWAYS--

17:02.670 --> 17:04.729
WELL, MY BROTHER GETS THERE
EXACTLY ON TIME.

17:04.850 --> 17:05.919
- OH YEAH?
YOUR OLDER BROTHER?

17:06.020 --> 17:06.873
- SO I PRETEND LIKE
I AM MY BROTHER.

17:06.990 --> 17:08.218
YEAH MY OLDER BROTHER.

17:08.330 --> 17:09.433

17:17.580 --> 17:20.333

17:31.700 --> 17:33.497
- YEAH, THERE'S A LOT OF TIME
TO FIGURE OUT.

17:33.600 --> 17:35.522
- NO, NO, IT WAS JUST A LONG
TIME FROM NOW.

17:35.640 --> 17:36.493
I'M NOT SURE WHAT WE'RE GONNA BE
DOING IN DECEMBER, YOU KNOW.

17:36.600 --> 17:37.419
- NO, OF COURSE.
- IN THE MONTH OF DECEMBER.

17:37.530 --> 17:38.326
THAT'S REALLY NICE.

17:50.650 --> 17:51.787
- MM-HMM.

17:51.890 --> 17:54.404

17:54.520 --> 17:59.548
- SO TOMORROW, AM I--AM I GONNA
GO WITH YOU TO THE LAWYER?

18:01.560 --> 18:04.279
- NO HADDIE, YOU CAN'T.
FOR WHAT?

18:04.390 --> 18:06.836
- YOU'RE LIKE FEELING SCARED
OR WORRIED OR SOMETHING.

18:06.940 --> 18:10.944
I WOULD WANNA BE THERE LIKE,

18:11.050 --> 18:12.358

18:12.470 --> 18:14.495
AND-AND YOU'VE BEEN HELPING ME
SO MUCH

18:14.610 --> 18:16.362
JUST BY SPENDING TIME WITH ME
AND JUST HANGING OUT

18:16.470 --> 18:18.529
AND JUST TAKING MY MIND OFF
OF IT.

18:18.640 --> 18:21.950
AND THAT--THAT MEANS
THE WORLD TO ME.

18:22.060 --> 18:23.231
- OKAY.

18:23.340 --> 18:27.401
- ALL RIGHT? LET ME
JUST DO THIS MYSELF, OKAY?

18:27.520 --> 18:29.272
THERE'S SOMETHING I JUST NEED
TO GET THROUGH,

18:29.380 --> 18:30.517
AND I'LL TELL YOU
ABOUT IT LATER.

18:30.620 --> 18:34.135
I'LL TELL YOU ABOUT IT TOMORROW,
OKAY?

18:34.250 --> 18:35.137

- MAX'S TEACHER HASN'T EMAILED
ME BACK YET.

19:03.520 --> 19:05.681
I MEAN, THIS IS RIDICULOUS.

19:05.790 --> 19:08.486
- WELL, HOW MANY EMAILS
HAVE YOU SENT HER?

19:08.590 --> 19:10.649
- LIKE SEVEN. I MEAN,
SOME RESPONSE WOULD BE NICE.

19:10.770 --> 19:12.214
I'M JUST REALLY...

19:12.320 --> 19:13.651
- SEVEN AND TOMORROW IS MAX'S
FOURTH DAY OF SCHOOL?

19:13.770 --> 19:15.453
- I JUST WANT TO KNOW
WHAT'S GOING ON.

19:15.560 --> 19:17.380
LIKE, SHE HASN'T CONTACTED
ME ABOUT ANYTHING,

19:17.500 --> 19:19.047
SHE KNOWS HE HAS ASPERGER'S.
- MM-HMM.

19:19.150 --> 19:21.459
- HE'S NOT LIKE THE OTHER KIDS
AT SCHOOL AND I'M WORRIED.

19:21.570 --> 19:24.459
I JUST FEEL LIKE IT'S EVERYTHING
RIGHT NOW.

19:24.570 --> 19:26.367
YOU KNOW, IT'S NOT JUST MAX
AND THE NEW SCHOOL.

19:26.470 --> 19:28.392
- I FEEL LIKE IT'S MY JOB AND
I'M WORRYING ABOUT--

19:28.510 --> 19:30.080
I'M JUST WORRIED ABOUT YOUR JOB,

19:30.200 --> 19:32.987
AND I'M WORRIED ABOUT HADDIE,
AND I'M WORRIED ABOUT THE BABY.

19:33.100 --> 19:34.431
- MM-HMM, MM-HMM.
OKAY.

19:34.550 --> 19:36.131
- I'M NOT DOING SO GREAT
MENTALLY RIGHT NOW.

19:36.240 --> 19:37.446
- OKAY.

19:37.550 --> 19:39.541
- I'M JUST HORMONAL
AND I'M JUST--

19:39.660 --> 19:42.106
IF SHE COULD JUST EMAIL ME BACK,
I WOULD FEEL A LITTLE BETTER.

19:42.210 --> 19:44.622
- ALL RIGHT, OKAY.

19:44.730 --> 19:46.072
- [exhales]
I'M UNRAVELING A LITTLE BIT.

19:46.180 --> 19:49.832
THAT'S ALL.

19:49.940 --> 19:51.828
- HEY, I'M MAKING THE CALL.

19:51.940 --> 19:57.185
I'M TAKING THE JOB,
I'LL START NEXT WEEK.

19:57.290 --> 19:58.496
- HONEY, YOU DON'T HAVE
TO DO THAT.

19:58.610 --> 20:01.056
I KNOW IT'S NOT YOUR DREAM JOB,
IT'S JUST--I'M...

20:01.160 --> 20:03.537
- WE'RE HAVING A BABY,
YOU KNOW.

20:03.650 --> 20:06.289
IT'S WORK, IT'S A PAYCHECK.
I GOTTA TAKE THE JOB.

20:06.410 --> 20:08.435
IT'S THE RIGHT THING TO DO.

20:08.550 --> 20:11.519
YOU DON'T HAVE TO FEEL
BAD ABOUT IT.

20:14.590 --> 20:18.697
YOU KNOW WHAT,
IT'LL BE OKAY.

20:21.660 --> 20:24.220
IT'LL BE OKAY,
ALL RIGHT?

20:24.320 --> 20:27.949
FEEL FOR THE FROWNING NOW

20:28.050 --> 20:35.468
NOWHERE TO BEGIN,
ARE YOU TO FIGURE IT OUT?

20:35.570 --> 20:38.198
WOULDN'T YOU LIKE TO KNOW?

20:38.300 --> 20:40.097
WOULDN'T YOU LIKE
TO KNOW

20:40.200 --> 20:43.749
WOULDN'T YOU LIKE TO KNOW

20:43.860 --> 20:48.138
- UM, SHOULD I--SHOULD I PARK
THIS SOMEWHERE DOWN THE STREET?

20:48.240 --> 20:52.552
- I WOULD LOVE TO,
BUT I--I FORGOT.

20:52.660 --> 20:55.208
I WAS JUST THINKING OF IT
THAT I HAVE A DEADLINE

20:55.320 --> 20:56.651
FOR MY WRITING CLASS TOMORROW.

20:56.770 --> 20:58.931
- OKAY.
- SO, MAYBE NOT TONIGHT.

20:59.050 --> 21:00.278
- NO PROBLEM.
- I'M SORRY.

21:00.390 --> 21:01.732
- NO, YOU DON'T HAVE
TO APOLOGIZE.

21:01.840 --> 21:07.153
I KNOW THAT THE TIMING WASN'T
RIGHT TWO YEARS AGO,

21:07.260 --> 21:12.288
BUT IT SEEMS LIKE THE TIMING IS
RIGHT NOW FOR ME AT LEAST.

21:12.400 --> 21:18.373
AND I JUST--I GUESS I WANTED TO
LET YOU KNOW THAT

21:18.480 --> 21:23.440
THIS SIDE OF THE CAR
IS READY NOW,

21:23.550 --> 21:27.065
AND I DON'T KNOW
ABOUT THAT SIDE OF THE CAR.

21:27.180 --> 21:28.408
ABOUT IT OR ANYTHING.

21:28.520 --> 21:33.457
I JUST WANTED
YOU KNOW THAT I'M IN.

21:41.920 --> 21:45.435
- I DON'T KNOW.

21:48.990 --> 21:52.027
I DON'T KNOW WHY,
BUT I JUST DON'T KNOW.

21:56.970 --> 21:58.096
I'LL TALK TO YOU TOMORROW.

21:58.210 --> 21:59.370
- OKAY.
- OKAY.

21:59.490 --> 22:00.377
THANK YOU AGAIN.

22:00.490 --> 22:01.934
- YEAH.
- YEAH.

22:04.900 --> 22:06.788
[starts engine]

22:08.110 --> 22:10.419
WOULDN'T YOU LIKE TO KNOW

22:10.530 --> 22:14.569
THE ODDS OF BEING ALONE

22:19.060 --> 22:21.699
[school bell ringing]

22:21.820 --> 22:23.959
- ZACK, HI.

22:24.060 --> 22:26.096
- HEY.

22:26.200 --> 22:28.373
- UM...

22:28.480 --> 22:33.793
I'M SO SORRY.
I'M--I'M SO SORRY.

22:33.900 --> 22:35.583
I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT
THAT HAPPENED.

22:35.690 --> 22:37.897
IT WAS A COMPLETE
MISUNDERSTANDING.

22:39.970 --> 22:41.972
HE FEELS TERRIBLE.

22:42.080 --> 22:44.139
- OKAY.

22:44.250 --> 22:48.846
- I CAN UNDERSTAND THAT YOU'RE
MAD, AND YOU CAN BE MAD.

22:48.950 --> 22:52.010
I JUST FEEL LIKE THERE'S
PROBABLY ANOTHER WAY

22:52.120 --> 22:54.816
THAT WE COULD WORK THIS OUT
OTHER THAN LIKE PRESSING CHARGES

22:54.920 --> 22:57.263
JUST BECAUSE, YOU KNOW,
HE COULD GO TO JAIL.

22:57.370 --> 23:00.476
IT DOESN'T FEEL LIKE IT WAS THAT
BAD OF A THING AND I'M SORRY.

23:00.580 --> 23:01.956
- LOOK, IF IT WAS UP TO ME,

23:02.070 --> 23:04.129
I WOULD DROP THE CHARGES
IN A SECOND, OKAY?

23:04.240 --> 23:05.969
BUT MY PARENTS ARE
REALLY PISSED.

23:06.070 --> 23:09.892
- DID YOU EXPLAIN, LIKE,
THE CIRCUMSTANCES?

23:10.000 --> 23:11.001
- YEAH, YEAH.

23:11.110 --> 23:13.761
DUDE HAS A RECORD.

23:13.870 --> 23:16.930
- HE DOESN'T HAVE A RECORD.

23:17.050 --> 23:18.494
- YEAH, HE DOES ACTUALLY.

23:18.600 --> 23:21.046
ATTEMPTED MURDER AND ROBBERY.

23:21.150 --> 23:21.946
- SORRY.

23:22.050 --> 23:23.665
I KNOW ALEX,
AND HE WOULDN'T DO THAT.

23:23.780 --> 23:25.259
AND HE DOESN'T HAVE A RECORD.

23:25.360 --> 23:33.859
- WELL, MAYBE HE WOULDN'T,
BUT HE DID.

23:33.960 --> 23:46.384
[school bell rings]
[indistinct chatter]

23:46.490 --> 23:50.699
- HI.
I'M MAX BRAVERMAN.

23:55.640 --> 23:57.494
- I LOOKED YOU IN THE EYE.

23:57.600 --> 23:59.739
- WHAT HIS PROBLEM?

24:11.790 --> 24:15.089
- WHAT ARE YOU READING?

24:15.210 --> 24:20.557
- YEAH.

24:22.630 --> 24:25.929
- YOU PROBABLY HEARD I HAD
A VISITOR THE OTHER NIGHT.

24:26.050 --> 24:30.328
- YEP.
I HEARD.

24:30.430 --> 24:31.829
- I LIKE HIM.

24:31.950 --> 24:33.599
- THAT'S NICE.

24:33.710 --> 24:37.294
- AND HE'S 28.

24:37.400 --> 24:39.265
- YEAH, 28 IS KIND OF YOUNG.

24:39.370 --> 24:41.474
- HE WAS TWO YEARS OLD WHEN
THE BREAKFAST CLUBCAME OUT.

24:41.580 --> 24:43.889
- WOW, WAS THAT LONG AGO?
- YEAH, YEAH.

24:43.990 --> 24:45.617
AND WE'RE IN THE CAR
THE OTHER NIGHT,

24:45.720 --> 24:47.517
AND I KNOW MUSIC,
I'M NOT, YOU KNOW,

24:47.620 --> 24:49.895
BUT HE'S PLAYING THIS STUFF
CALLED NAKED KIDS.

24:50.000 --> 24:51.752
I'VE NEVER EVEN HEARD
ABOUT THEM.

24:51.860 --> 24:53.248
- YOU'VE NEVER HEARD
OF NAKED KIDS?

24:53.350 --> 24:54.487
- YOU HAVE?

24:54.590 --> 24:57.343
- LOOK, THESE ARE NOT
LEGITIMATE CONCERNS

24:57.460 --> 24:59.178
OF MOVIES AND MUSIC GROUPS.

24:59.290 --> 25:01.429
WHAT'S THE REAL DEAL?

25:01.530 --> 25:04.419
- I MEAN, I SHOULD BE
WITH SOMEONE MY OWN AGE,

25:05.710 --> 25:07.211
- MAYBE.
NOT NECESSARILY.

25:07.330 --> 25:09.423
YOU KNOW, IF YOU WERE
WITH SOMEONE WHO WAS 40,

25:09.540 --> 25:13.670
HE COULD BE TWICE DIVORCED
AND HAVE FIVE KIDS, YOU KNOW.

25:13.780 --> 25:15.463
I MEAN, THERE--THERE COULD
ALWAYS BE AN ISSUE

25:15.580 --> 25:20.062
IF YOU WANTED TO MAKE AN ISSUE.

25:20.170 --> 25:21.990
RELAX.
HAVE A GOOD TIME.

25:22.100 --> 25:27.299
YOU KNOW, ENJOY YOURSELF,
YEAH?

25:27.420 --> 25:31.140
- WHO CAN DO THAT?

25:31.250 --> 25:34.139
- WHAT'S STOPPING YOU?

25:34.250 --> 25:40.701
WHAT'S STOPPING YOU?

25:40.810 --> 25:42.539
- HOW DID CROSBY CONVINCE
YOU TO GIVE HIM

25:42.640 --> 25:45.154
MY SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER?
- WHAT?

25:45.260 --> 25:47.535
- WHY DID YOU GIVE CROSBY
MY SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER?

25:47.640 --> 25:50.529
- OH.

25:50.650 --> 25:55.235
WELL, HE SAID HE NEEDED IT.

25:55.340 --> 25:56.477
- ALL RIGHT.
WELL, LISTEN.

25:56.580 --> 25:57.820
YOU KNOW WHAT HE DID WITH IT?

25:57.930 --> 25:59.340
HE PUT MY NAME DOWN
ON A LOAN APPLICATION

25:59.450 --> 26:00.849
WITH THAT INFORMATION.

26:00.970 --> 26:02.995
HE IMPLICATED ME AS PARTNER
IN HIS NEW BUSINESS.

26:03.110 --> 26:04.896
- NO.
- YEAH.

26:05.010 --> 26:05.965
- REALLY?

26:06.080 --> 26:07.104
- OKAY, SO I NEED
YOUR HELP HERE.

26:07.220 --> 26:08.380
I NEED YOU TO JUST REMIND ME
OF ALL THE WAYS

26:08.490 --> 26:09.354
THAT CROSBY IS A SCREW UP,
OKAY?

26:09.460 --> 26:10.552
- HE'S IMPULSIVE.

26:10.670 --> 26:13.070
I MEAN, MY GOSH, HE THINKS
EVERYBODY FEELS

26:13.190 --> 26:14.873
THE SAME WAY ABOUT STUFF
THAT HE DOES,

26:14.980 --> 26:17.562
AND IF HE FINDS OUT THAT YOU'RE
ON A DIFFERENT PAGE THAN HE IS,

26:17.670 --> 26:18.534
WHAT YOU...
- TOTALLY DIFFERENT PAGE.

26:18.640 --> 26:19.493
- HE GETS UPSET.
- YEAH.

26:19.610 --> 26:21.191
LIKE A LITTLE BABY.

26:21.300 --> 26:23.222
- THAT KID HAS MANAGE TO LOSE
EVERY TOOL I'VE EVER OWNED.

26:23.340 --> 26:24.261
- NOT SURPRISING.

26:24.370 --> 26:26.053
- HE GOES THROUGH WOMEN
LIKE COTTON CANDY.

26:26.170 --> 26:28.309
- DAD, DON'T FORGET HE SLEPT
WITH MY SON'S BEHAVIORAL AIDE.

26:28.410 --> 26:30.298
AND, YOU KNOW, EVERY TIME WE GO
OUT FOR A MEAL,

26:30.410 --> 26:31.616
GUESS WHO HAS TO PICK UP
THE CHECK.

26:31.720 --> 26:32.709
- YOU DO?
- I DO.

26:32.830 --> 26:33.990
- WHEN HE WAS 16,
HE STOLE MY CAR,

26:34.100 --> 26:35.237
HE BASHED IT INTO
A GARBAGE CAN.

26:35.350 --> 26:36.339
- REMEMBER THIS?

26:36.450 --> 26:37.371
- TEARS THE BUMPER OFF.

26:37.490 --> 26:38.411
GUESS WHO ENDS UP PAYING FOR IT?

26:38.520 --> 26:39.418
- YOU?
- YEAH, ME.

26:39.520 --> 26:40.930
- SURE.
- WHY?

26:41.040 --> 26:42.314
- HE'S NOT GONNA PAY FOR IT.
- YOU NEVER PAID FOR IT.

26:42.420 --> 26:43.409
- YOU KNOW WHAT? HE TAKES STUFF
WITHOUT ASKING.

26:43.530 --> 26:45.737
BORROWS MONEY,
DOESN'T PAY IT BACK.

26:45.840 --> 26:47.637
AND YOU KNOW WHAT
REALLY BOTHERS ME?

26:47.740 --> 26:49.184
THIS IS KIND OF CRAZY,
BUT SOMETIMES, YOU KNOW,

26:49.290 --> 26:51.429
HE WEARS THE SAME SHIRT
TWO DAYS IN A ROW.

26:51.540 --> 26:54.600
- YEAH.
WELL, I DO THAT.

26:54.710 --> 26:56.257
- YEAH.
WELL, YEAH, WELL, YOU KNOW,

26:56.370 --> 26:58.224
I MEAN UNLESS YOUR CAMPING,
IT'S KINDA GROSS.

26:58.340 --> 27:00.399
- UM-HMM.
- ANYWAY...

27:00.510 --> 27:01.431
- BOY.
SON, I GOT TO TELL YOU,

27:01.550 --> 27:03.199
I UNDERSTAND PERFECT LY,

27:03.310 --> 27:06.234
COMPLETELY OF WHY YOU WOULDN'T
GO INTO BUSINESS WITH HIM.

27:06.340 --> 27:08.479
- YEAH, AND YET YOU GIVE HIM
MY SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER.

27:08.590 --> 27:12.481
- IT JUST SEEMED TO MEAN
SO MUCH TO HIM.

27:12.590 --> 27:16.458
WHEN HE TOLD ME,
I SWEAR TO GOD,

27:16.560 --> 27:20.621
HE HAD TEARS IN HIS EYES.

27:20.740 --> 27:23.208
- YOU SUCK, DAD.

27:23.330 --> 27:28.154
YOU SUCK.

27:28.260 --> 27:29.488
- NOW, YOU SAY HELLO
TO YOU MOTHER.

27:29.610 --> 27:31.328
- YEAH.

27:31.440 --> 27:32.293
- AND I'LL BE OUT HERE.

27:32.400 --> 27:34.641
- OH, YEAH.

27:34.750 --> 27:36.194
- I GOT STUCK
IN SOME TRAFFIC

27:36.300 --> 27:38.404
COMING FROM THE PRESS
CONFERENCE. UH-HUH.

27:38.510 --> 27:40.159
YEAH, I PROBABLY ABOUT
20 MINUTES.

27:40.270 --> 27:43.205
OKAY, THAN KS.

28:02.850 --> 28:05.364
- IT VERY CLEARLY STATES THAT
YOU HAVE THE APARTMENT

28:05.470 --> 28:08.644
THROUGH JANUARY 2012,
SO THIS WILL BE NO PROBLEM.

28:08.750 --> 28:11.127
- [sighs]
THAT'S HUGE.

28:11.240 --> 28:13.617
MY LIFE IS SUCH A TRAIN WRECK
RIGHT NOW.

28:13.720 --> 28:14.823
I WAS REALLY HOPING SLEEPING ON
THE STREETS

28:14.930 --> 28:17.990
WASN'T GONNA BE PART OF IT.
[sighs]

28:18.110 --> 28:21.273
- I'M SURE WHAT YOU'RE DOING
IS NOT EASY.

28:21.380 --> 28:23.075
- I'M NOT THE FIRST DUMBASS
TO GET KNOCKED UP

28:23.180 --> 28:26.627
WHEN SHE WASN'T SUPPOSED TO, SO
I CAN'T FEEL TOO BAD FOR MYSELF.

28:26.730 --> 28:28.732
I WAS RAISED CATHOLIC.
- UH-HMM.

28:28.840 --> 28:31.968
- I GUESS I'M NOT ANYMORE,
BUT, YOU KNOW,

28:32.080 --> 28:34.150
AT THE END OF THE DAY,
YOU STILL HEAR THE HYMNS.

28:34.260 --> 28:36.012
- NO, I KIND OF WISH
THAT I HAD A RELIGION.

28:36.120 --> 28:37.633
WE WEREN'T RAISED
WITH ANYTHING SPECIFIC.

28:37.750 --> 28:40.742
- THE AGENCY FORM I FILLED OUT
ASKED IF I HAD A PREFERENCE

28:40.850 --> 28:42.260
FOR THE ADOPTED PARENTS'
RELIGION...

28:42.370 --> 28:43.120
- UH-HMM.

28:43.230 --> 28:45.926
- AND I JUST
KEPT THINKING NONE.

28:46.030 --> 28:47.338
- YOU'RE WORKING WITH AN AGENCY?

28:47.440 --> 28:48.919
- YEAH.

28:49.030 --> 28:51.476
I GUESS THERE'S ALREADY SOME
HUGE WAITING LIST FOR BABIES.

28:51.590 --> 28:53.410
I GUESS SOME PEOPLE HAVE
TROUBLE GETTING PREGNANT.

28:53.520 --> 28:55.659
- YEAH.
YEAH.

28:55.760 --> 29:01.289
I GUESS SO.

29:02.360 --> 29:03.691
- ARE YOU OKAY?

29:03.810 --> 29:04.834
DO YOU NEED SOME WATER
OR SOMETHING?

29:04.950 --> 29:07.350
- NO.
I DON'T KNOW.

29:07.460 --> 29:10.156
I'M HUNGRY OR SOMETHING,
I THINK I'VE SKIPPED LUNCH.

29:10.260 --> 29:11.534
- I CAN GO STEAL YOU SOME
FROM THE CART.

29:11.640 --> 29:12.629
- NO, NO, NO.

29:12.750 --> 29:13.944
- NO ONE'S GONNA NOTICE.
IT'S OKAY, TRUST ME.

29:14.060 --> 29:15.914
- I--LET ME JUST TAKE ONE MORE
LOOK AT YOUR LEASE,

29:16.030 --> 29:19.158
AND THEN I'LL GIVE IT BACK TO
YOU, AND WE'LL BE GOOD.

29:27.800 --> 29:29.131
[knocks on desk]

29:29.250 --> 29:30.239
- HEY, KRISTINA.

29:30.350 --> 29:31.829
- HI, MS. MCKENDO.

29:31.940 --> 29:33.908
HOW ARE YOU DOING?
- I'M GOOD.

29:34.010 --> 29:36.149
- I JUST--I WANTED TO SEE
IF I COULD TALK TO YOU

29:36.250 --> 29:37.808
FOR A COUPLE OF MINUTES.
I BROUGHT A COFFEE...

29:37.910 --> 29:38.877
- NO, I GOTTA GO.

29:38.980 --> 29:40.117
- THOUGHT WE COULD SPEAK
FOR A SECOND.

29:40.220 --> 29:41.255
I SENT YOU A COUPLE OF EMAILS.
- OH, NINE, I THINK.

29:41.360 --> 29:43.248
- REGARDING MAX--I KNOW
THAT'S A LOT FOR FOUR DAYS

29:43.360 --> 29:45.737
BUT I JUST REALLY WANTED TO TALK
WITH YOU ABOUT MAX'S PROGRESS.

29:45.850 --> 29:46.669
- RIGHT.
- I BROUGHT US A COFFEE.

29:46.780 --> 29:48.224
- NO, I KNOW.

29:48.330 --> 29:49.297
- I THOUGHT WE COULD SIT AND
TAKE A MOMENT JUST TO TALK.

29:49.400 --> 29:50.606
- LISTEN, I'M GONNA GET
TO THOSE.

29:50.710 --> 29:51.677
I'M GONNA GET TO
ALL MY EMAILS TONIGHT.

29:51.790 --> 29:52.677
I'LL GET TO IT, TONIGHT.

29:52.790 --> 29:56.544
- OKAY, GREAT.
YOU KNOW WHAT, PLEASE.

29:56.650 --> 29:59.130
PLEASE, I JUST--I REALLY WOULD
LIKE TO TALK TO YOU FOR JUST--

29:59.240 --> 30:01.276
IT'LL TAKE FIVE MINUTES.
THAT'S IT.

30:01.380 --> 30:02.301
- OKAY.
- OKAY?

30:02.420 --> 30:04.627
- ALL RIGHT.
SIT--SIT DOWN. LET'S...

30:04.730 --> 30:06.891
- IF I WEREN'T WORRIED,
I WOULDN'T--

30:07.010 --> 30:08.386
I WOULDN'T HAVE BARGED
IN LIKE THIS.

30:08.490 --> 30:12.870
BUT MAX'S DAD AND I TOOK
A HUGE--HUGE LEAP OF FAITH

30:12.980 --> 30:15.073
BY SENDING HIM TO THE SCHOOL
AND MAINSTREAMING HIM.

30:15.190 --> 30:15.940
- RIGHT.

30:16.050 --> 30:19.395
WELL, WHY DID YOU
MAINSTREAM HIM?

30:19.500 --> 30:21.252
- WELL, WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
DO YOU THINK IT WAS A BAD IDEA?

30:21.370 --> 30:22.849
BECAUSE I FOUGHT MY HUSBAND
ON IT FOR A LITTLE WHILE.

30:22.950 --> 30:25.601
- NO, NO, I DON'T--I'M NOT
SAYING IT WAS A BAD IDEA,

30:25.720 --> 30:28.188
I'M ASKING WHY YOU DID IT.

30:28.300 --> 30:29.927
- SO HE COULD BE
ACADEMICALLY CHALLENGED.

30:30.030 --> 30:32.681
- AND HE WILL BE.
HE'S EXTREMELY BRIGHT.

30:32.790 --> 30:36.681
- I JUST--I WORRY BECAUSE,
I'M GONNA SOUND LIKE A WEIRDO,

30:36.800 --> 30:39.030
BUT I ACTUALLY LEI-T WORK
YESTERDAY

30:39.140 --> 30:41.199
JUST TO SORT OF SPY ON HIM,

30:41.320 --> 30:42.526
JUST TO SEE HOW HE WAS DOING,

30:42.630 --> 30:45.485
AND COPING, AND I'M WORRIED
ABOUT HIM SOCIALLY

30:45.600 --> 30:49.286
AND I CAME TO SCHOOL, AND I SAW
HIM SITTING ON--ON THE TABLE

30:49.390 --> 30:52.666
BY HIMSELF AT LUNCH TIME.
AND I JUST GET A LITTLE CONCERN.

30:52.780 --> 30:54.156
I KNOW I SOUND
LIKE A TOTAL FREAK,

30:54.260 --> 30:57.741
AND I'M JUST--I'M VERY EMOTIONAL
BECAUSE OF HORMONES AND...

30:57.850 --> 30:59.329
- YOU'RE NOT FREAK.

30:59.440 --> 31:02.785
IT'S--YOU'RE JUST GONNA HAVE
TO GET A LITTLE MORE COMFORTABLE

31:02.890 --> 31:07.782
WITH HAVING LESS CONTROL.

31:07.900 --> 31:09.208
- THAT'S GONNA BE REALLY
HARD FOR ME.

31:09.310 --> 31:10.231
- I KNOW.

31:10.350 --> 31:11.658
- COULD I MAYBE GET
YOUR HOME NUMBER?

31:11.760 --> 31:13.682
[laughs]
I'M JUST KIDDING.

31:13.800 --> 31:16.792
I WOULDN'T DO THAT TO YOU.
I MEAN.

31:16.900 --> 31:20.176
- I'LL TRY TO BE
A LITTLE MORE...

31:20.290 --> 31:21.279
- THANKS.

31:21.390 --> 31:22.357
- ANSWER THE EMAILS
A LITTLE QUICKER.

31:22.460 --> 31:24.212
- OKAY.

31:24.330 --> 31:25.877
- HE'LL BE FINE!

31:30.880 --> 31:32.461
[knocks on door]

31:32.580 --> 31:33.467
- AHEM.
- HEY.

31:33.580 --> 31:34.433
- HEY.

31:34.540 --> 31:37.816
UM, SO, I GAVE MY LANDLORD
THAT LETTER,

31:37.930 --> 31:40.398
AND HE COMPLETELY BACKED OFF.

31:40.510 --> 31:42.751
LIKE, I'D NEVER SEEN HIM
SO TERRIFIED.

31:42.860 --> 31:44.134
- [laughs]

31:44.240 --> 31:47.277
- SO--UM, I GOT YOU
A FREE COFFEE.

31:47.380 --> 31:49.007
IT'S NOT QUITE
FREE LEGAL ADVICE,

31:49.110 --> 31:51.032
BUT IT'S GOOD
WITH A DOUGHNUT.

31:51.150 --> 31:54.313
- [laughs]
WELL, I'M GLAD I COULD HELP,

31:54.420 --> 31:59.972
AND THANK YOU VERY MUCH
FOR THE COFFEE.

32:00.090 --> 32:05.778
- IF--IF THERE'S EVER ANYTHING
I CAN DO FOR--FOR YOU,

32:05.880 --> 32:10.499
I MEAN, I KNOW SOME PRETTY COOL
CAPOEIRA MOVES, YOU KNOW.

32:10.610 --> 32:12.953
- THAT MAYBE COULD COME
IN HANDY, THANKS.

32:13.060 --> 32:14.129
- TAEIQNONDO?

32:14.240 --> 32:20.065
- I GUESS, I'M JUST--
THANK YOU.

32:24.010 --> 32:29.107
- ZOE...

32:29.220 --> 32:41.599
WOULD YOU EVER CONSIDER
THAT I MAY ADOPT YOUR BABY?

32:41.710 --> 32:43.849
- UM...

32:43.960 --> 32:48.169
NO.

32:53.240 --> 32:55.583
- OUR PLAN IS TO TRY TO
HANG ONTO AS MUCH OF THESE

32:55.690 --> 32:58.579
FURNISHINGS AS POSSIBLE BECAUSE
IT'S SO AUTHENTIC AND THEN--OH,

32:58.700 --> 33:01.726
WE WHERE GONNA TRY TO MAKE THIS
FUNCTIONAL AGAIN.

33:01.840 --> 33:04.559
MAKE GRILLED CHEESES AND MALTS,
THAT KIND OF THING, YOU KNOW,

33:04.670 --> 33:07.491
SO THE MUSICIANS HAVE SOMETHING
TO SNACK ON IN BETWEEN.

33:07.600 --> 33:10.592
- GUYS, I AM GOTTA BE HONEST
WITH YOU.

33:10.710 --> 33:13.770
I'VE JUST GOT A GREAT OFFER
FROM ANOTHER DEVELOPER

33:13.880 --> 33:15.256
AND HE'S PRETTY SOLID.

33:15.370 --> 33:16.268
- REALLY?

33:16.370 --> 33:17.917
- WELL, THIS IS
A PRETTY UNIQUE SPACE.

33:18.030 --> 33:19.156
WHAT ARE THEY PLANNING ON DOING?

33:19.270 --> 33:20.885
- THEY GOT PRETTY MUCH RIPPED
EVERYTHING OUT

33:20.990 --> 33:24.266
AND PUT IN OFFICE SPACE.

33:24.380 --> 33:25.779
- ARE YOU KIDDING--
YOU'RE NOT KIDDING?

33:25.900 --> 33:27.299
THAT'S--THAT'S
A TERRIBLE IDEA.

33:27.410 --> 33:30.413
YOU CAN'T LET THEM DO THAT.
- EXCUSE ME.

33:30.520 --> 33:32.101
- HE DIDN'T MEAN IT
LIKE THAT EXACTLY.

33:32.210 --> 33:33.859
- NO, NO.
I MEAN, I KNOW I MEAN THAT.

33:33.970 --> 33:35.585
- I'M PRETTY SURE YOU DIDN'T.

33:35.700 --> 33:38.100
- I DO HAVE ANOTHER MEETING
TO GET TO, GENTLEMEN.

33:38.220 --> 33:41.007
- OKAY.
I'LL MAKE THIS REALLY QUICK.

33:41.120 --> 33:43.179
YOU OWN A HISTORICAL TREASURE.

33:43.290 --> 33:45.042
- DUDE, PEOPLE IN REAL STATE
DON'T LIKE TO HEAR THE WORD,

33:45.160 --> 33:46.013
HISTORICAL.

33:46.120 --> 33:47.087
- OKAY.

33:47.190 --> 33:49.181
OKAY, SO WHAT
WE WOULD LIKE TO DO

33:49.300 --> 33:53.919
IS TAKE THIS NON-HISTORICAL SITE
AND REINVENT WHAT IT WAS.

33:54.030 --> 33:56.169
YOU KNOW, UPDATE EVERYTHING,
MAKE IT DIGITAL,

33:56.270 --> 33:57.612
BUT HOLD ON TO THAT ESSENCE
THAT BROUGHT

33:57.720 --> 34:00.302
ALL OF TH ESE
AMAZING, AMAZING BANDS HERE.

34:00.410 --> 34:01.752
I'VE BEEN A SOUND ENGINEER
FOR 10 YEARS.

34:01.860 --> 34:04.966
I KNOW WHAT I'M DOING.
I'M GOOD.

34:05.070 --> 34:06.719
AND I'VE COMMITMENTS
FROM A LOT OF ARTISTS

34:06.830 --> 34:08.036
THAT WANNA FOLLOW ME
OVER HERE.

34:08.140 --> 34:11.792
- IT'S--IT IS VERY ROMANTIC
AND APPEALING,

34:11.910 --> 34:15.835
BUT THIS OTHER DEVELOPER HAS
A REALLY SOLID LONG-TERM PLAN,

34:15.950 --> 34:20.250
AND I GOTTA BE SMART HERE, GUYS.

34:20.360 --> 34:22.772
- WELL, I THINK THIS
IS THE SMART FINANCIAL THING.

34:22.880 --> 34:25.769
NOW I'VE RUN TINA'S FOOTWEAR
FOR 15 YEARS AT A PROFIT,

34:25.890 --> 34:27.608
AND I BELIEVE IN THIS.
THIS IS A GREAT IDEA.

34:27.720 --> 34:29.676
THIS IS THE RIGHT SPACE,
IT'S THE RIGHT TIME,

34:29.790 --> 34:31.781
IT'S THE RIGHT IDEA,
IT'S THE RIGHT WAY TO USE IT.

34:31.890 --> 34:33.164
YOU JUST GET TO SEE IT.
YOU JUST GOTTA LOOK ROUND.

34:33.270 --> 34:34.897
YOU GOTTA SEE WHAT
HE'S TALKING ABOUT.

34:35.000 --> 34:36.160
NOW, WOULD YOU RATHER BE
A PART OF

34:36.280 --> 34:38.032
A BUNCH OF OFFICE SPACE
AND CUBICLES

34:38.140 --> 34:39.653
AND I DON'T KNOW
WHAT WOULD GO ON HERE,

34:39.760 --> 34:40.897
BUT I'M SURE YOU'VE GONNA HAVE
A LOT MORE TURNOVER

34:41.000 --> 34:42.171
WITH WHATEVER THAT SITUATION IS

34:42.280 --> 34:44.077
THAN IF THIS
WAS RECORDING STUDIO.

34:44.180 --> 34:45.795
WE'RE NOT LEAVING.

34:45.910 --> 34:50.074
WE'RE HERE TO LEASE THIS SPACE
AND MAKE OUR BUSINESS WORK.

34:58.540 --> 35:00.917
- KIND OF STUPID TO EVEN
HAVE TO ASK YOU THIS,

35:01.020 --> 35:04.399
BUT YOU DON'T HAVE
A CRIMINAL RECORD.

35:04.510 --> 35:06.740
I MEAN, THAT'S RIDICULOUS,
RIGHT?

35:16.730 --> 35:20.837
ALEX, I DON'T KNOW HOW
YOU COULDN'T HAVE TOLD ME THAT.

35:20.940 --> 35:25.491
- HADDIE, YOU HAVE NO CLUE.

35:25.600 --> 35:29.229
YOU HAVE NO IDEA

35:29.330 --> 35:33.255
WHAT I WENT THROUGH.

35:33.370 --> 35:36.294
THOSE YEARS I WAS IN TROUBLE,

35:36.410 --> 35:41.029
THINGS THAT I'M ASHAMED OF.

35:41.130 --> 35:42.233
HADDIE, I PICKED UP
MY DAD'S GUN

35:42.340 --> 35:45.275
AND TRIED TO ROB
A LIQUOR STORE, OKAY?

35:45.380 --> 35:48.235
BECAUSE I HAD NO MONEY,
I HAD NO FOOD.

35:48.350 --> 35:50.693
I HAD NO ALCOHOL.

35:50.800 --> 35:52.586
I NEED--NEEDED IT.

35:52.700 --> 35:55.521
HADDIE, I DIDN'T--

35:55.630 --> 35:57.666
I WAS SO LOW.

35:57.770 --> 35:58.839
AND I WAS SO WEAK.

35:58.940 --> 36:01.283
I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.

36:01.400 --> 36:04.358
IF I WOULD'VE BEEN HONEST,
UP FRONT,

36:04.470 --> 36:06.153
WOULD YOU HAVE STILL DATED ME?

36:06.260 --> 36:09.320
WOULD YOU HAVE STILL
BEEN HERE?

36:09.440 --> 36:13.228
HADDIE, COULD YOU'VE--
COULD YOU HAVE LOVED ME?

36:13.340 --> 36:15.740
NO, YOU WOULDN'T HAVE
LOOKED TWICE AT ME.

36:15.860 --> 36:19.023
WHY? BECAUSE WHEN PEOPLE
HEAR THAT, IT DEFINES YOU.

36:19.140 --> 36:22.234
THAT'S IT.
THERE IS NO SECOND CHANCES.

36:22.350 --> 36:26.457
I DIDN'T--
I DIDN'T WANNA LOSE YOU.

36:26.560 --> 36:33.352
AND I CAN'T, I CAN'T,
I CAN'T LOSE YOU.

36:33.460 --> 36:35.769
HADDIE, I DON'T HAVE
ANYBODY ELSE.

36:48.480 --> 36:52.302

THE MOST IMPORTANT THING.

37:25.760 --> 37:29.275
I DON'T WANT YOUR FEELINGS
TO BE HURT,

37:29.380 --> 37:30.961
NO MATTER WHAT.

37:31.070 --> 37:32.207
EVERYTHING'S GONNA BE OKAY.

37:32.310 --> 37:33.242
- WHAT IS THIS?

37:33.350 --> 37:34.931
WAIT, ARE YOU SICK?
ARE YOU DYING?

37:35.040 --> 37:37.554

THAT'S YOUR REACTION?

37:37.660 --> 37:39.412
YOU'RE WOULDN'T BE
MORE UPSET OR...
