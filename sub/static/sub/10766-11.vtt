00:18.697 --> 00:21.222
No, no, don't, please. Please, don't shoot.

00:25.037 --> 00:26.800
What's going on in here?

00:29.975 --> 00:32.808
Oh, my God. Geoffrey, don't move.

00:33.512 --> 00:35.412
There's a dart on your forehead.

00:36.748 --> 00:39.478
Really? I hadn't noticed.

00:40.586 --> 00:43.384
- Look, Carlton, Geoffrey's been shot.
- Cool.

00:43.455 --> 00:45.514
Y ou people don't pay me enough for this.

00:46.758 --> 00:48.350
Quiet, Geoffrey, you're dead.

00:48.427 --> 00:50.952
Then you couldn't possibly feel me do this.

00:55.934 --> 00:58.300
- Well, one down, three to go.
- Wait.

00:58.370 --> 01:00.270
Is anybody going to tell me
what's going on?

01:00.339 --> 01:01.397
We're playing Whodunnit.

01:01.473 --> 01:04.033
See, one of us is the killer,
and we have to find out who it is.

01:04.108 --> 01:05.370
I say, we already know.

01:05.444 --> 01:07.469
Y ou and I were together
in the other room, Ashley...

01:07.546 --> 01:09.741
and now Geoffrey's worm chow.

01:09.815 --> 01:12.807
So that leaves only one suspect.

01:13.151 --> 01:14.743
Honey, I'm home.

01:15.420 --> 01:16.944
Hey, Lucy.

01:19.291 --> 01:20.815
<i>E</i> thel, hello.

01:21.827 --> 01:23.795
Look, it's little Ricky.

01:24.896 --> 01:26.261
Oh, y'all should go check outside.

01:26.331 --> 01:28.697
Somebody was trampling through
Aunt Viv's garden.

01:28.767 --> 01:30.257
Nice try, Will.

01:30.335 --> 01:32.895
Y ou got Geoffrey,
but you're not gonna get me alone.

01:32.971 --> 01:35.235
Come on, Ashley,
we're going to the bathroom.

01:39.111 --> 01:41.011
What is he talking about?
I ain't kill nobody.

01:41.079 --> 01:45.015
Y eah, and George Bush is really looking
forward to playing with his grandchildren.

01:52.524 --> 01:55.049
Man, this is whack.
Don't nobody believe me.

01:57.362 --> 01:59.091
But I bet you do, right?

03:26.051 --> 03:28.178
Good, Aunt Vivian. Good, Aunt Vivian.

03:28.987 --> 03:31.285
Here, beg for a Scooby Snack.

03:33.058 --> 03:34.082
Cut it out.

03:34.159 --> 03:37.356
I'm trying to practice my breathing
for Lamaze class.

03:38.597 --> 03:40.189
I don't know, Aunt Viv.

03:40.265 --> 03:41.630
Seem to me all that heavy breathing...

03:41.700 --> 03:44.464
is what got you in this mess
in the first place.

03:44.536 --> 03:46.265
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

03:46.404 --> 03:48.065
- Hello, sweetheart.
- Hi, honey.

03:48.140 --> 03:49.266
- Hi, Will.
- Hey, Uncle Phil.

03:49.341 --> 03:50.706
Y ou ready for your Lamaze class?

03:50.776 --> 03:53.142
Philip, you mean,
you actually wanna take me?

03:53.211 --> 03:56.840
I was waiting for some lame excuse.
Last week, you said your dog died.

03:56.915 --> 03:59.975
- He did.
- Philip, he died 20 years ago.

04:00.051 --> 04:01.075
Still hurts.

04:02.621 --> 04:03.679
Hey, hey, hey. Come on, Aunt Viv.

04:03.755 --> 04:06.053
Now this is the most straight-up,
honest dude I know.

04:06.124 --> 04:09.093
The day that he lies to you,
may all my hair fall out.

04:09.161 --> 04:11.686
Thank you, Will. Come on, sweetheart,
we don't want to be late.

04:11.763 --> 04:13.856
- Okay.
- Okay, let me get the bags here.

04:14.666 --> 04:15.655
Philip.

04:17.035 --> 04:20.004
- Philip, what's the matter?
- It's my back, went out.

04:20.071 --> 04:21.470
Y ou know, I think maybe...

04:21.540 --> 04:24.008
if I could lay down on the couch
for a couple of hours...

04:24.075 --> 04:25.838
you know?

04:26.912 --> 04:29.710
Oh, my God, is my hairline receding?

04:31.817 --> 04:32.909
Come on, Philip, sit down.

04:32.984 --> 04:36.044
Now, Will, we all know
your uncle's got back problems.

04:36.121 --> 04:40.114
Now, relax, sweetheart.
Okay, I'll go to class again, alone.

04:40.625 --> 04:43.025
Will, would you take my duffel bag
out to the car for me?

04:43.094 --> 04:44.857
Y eah, that's fine, Aunt Viv.

05:06.251 --> 05:07.343
Y es!

05:11.623 --> 05:13.420
Freeze, bubble-butt!

05:17.229 --> 05:19.197
This could get ugly.

05:19.264 --> 05:21.528
Philip, what do you have to say
for yourself?

05:24.769 --> 05:27.260
Good answer, Admiral Stockdale.

05:29.741 --> 05:32.141
Philip, this is very important to me.

05:32.210 --> 05:34.770
After all, you missed all the other births
of your other children.

05:34.846 --> 05:35.870
Well, it wasn't my fault.

05:35.947 --> 05:37.972
Fathers weren't allowed
in the delivery room back then.

05:38.049 --> 05:40.574
They are now, and I would like you
to share this experience.

05:40.652 --> 05:41.778
Well, I intend to.

05:41.853 --> 05:43.980
I will be pacing up and down
in the waiting room...

05:44.055 --> 05:45.352
where a man's supposed to be.

05:45.423 --> 05:48.756
- Fine. If that's the way you feel, forget it!
- Wait, Vivian.

05:53.298 --> 05:56.290
- And what's your problem?
- Don't be trying to make up with me now.

05:58.603 --> 05:59.695
I'm all pregnant.

05:59.771 --> 06:02.797
My feet, my back, and stuff hurt,
and you being all insensitive.

06:05.310 --> 06:07.244
Here's our little mother.

06:07.312 --> 06:11.112
There we go, madam, a nice glass of milk.

06:11.349 --> 06:15.308
- Got to keep our strength up, eh?
- Back off, Geoffrey.

06:15.654 --> 06:17.622
Pop a Midol.

06:17.722 --> 06:21.249
Geoffrey, I'm sorry. I'm just a little upset
with Mr. Banks, that's all.

06:21.426 --> 06:23.860
He refuses to be my Lamaze coach.

06:24.129 --> 06:25.596
So...

06:26.364 --> 06:29.356
I'm gonna need one of you kids
to go with me.

06:30.335 --> 06:33.600
- Sorry, homework.
- Tennis lesson.

06:33.905 --> 06:35.736
I just don't want to.

06:38.677 --> 06:41.578
Madam, are you sure
you want another one?

06:43.081 --> 06:45.174
Wait a minute, here.
Look, what is the matter with y'all?

06:45.250 --> 06:47.775
I mean, this is your mother.
She's having a baby.

06:51.122 --> 06:53.920
Look, Aunt Viv, if I was one of your kids...

06:53.992 --> 06:56.620
I'd be short with a square head...

06:59.631 --> 07:02.361
but I'd be more than happy
to be your coach.

07:04.302 --> 07:07.465
Aunt Viv, it was a joke.
Y ou can't take a joke?

07:07.539 --> 07:09.837
Come on, Will.
I'm gonna be doing all the work.

07:09.908 --> 07:12.399
All you have to do is cheer me on.
Come on.

07:13.078 --> 07:16.775
Well, that's cool. Go, Vivian.
Get busy, have a baby.

07:16.848 --> 07:20.215
- See you later.
- Will, come on, stop it.

07:20.285 --> 07:22.913
Honey, this is a classroom,
not a delivery room.

07:22.988 --> 07:26.583
There's nothing here to embarrass you.
Come on.

07:31.396 --> 07:34.854
- Aunt Viv, you naked yet?
- Will, would you calm down?

07:34.966 --> 07:37.366
No one is gonna get naked. Come on.

07:48.980 --> 07:51.540
Whoa, Aunt Viv, who is she?

07:52.017 --> 07:55.111
Man, she is all that. She's fine.

07:55.887 --> 07:58.048
She's one of The Fat Boys.

08:00.525 --> 08:02.584
- Hi, Danny.
- Hey, Viv.

08:02.660 --> 08:04.651
How are you?

08:05.063 --> 08:08.829
Hey, you know, can you do me a favor?
I have not seen my feet since Lent.

08:08.900 --> 08:11.733
Can you tell me, do my shoes match?

08:11.970 --> 08:13.597
No.

08:14.172 --> 08:15.196
Damn.

08:15.807 --> 08:16.796
Well...

08:17.709 --> 08:20.701
- I see Phil stood you up again, huh?
- Right.

08:20.779 --> 08:24.010
- Who's the designated hitter?
- This is my nephew.

08:25.283 --> 08:27.979
- How you doing? I'm Will.
- Danny Mitchell.

08:28.787 --> 08:31.984
So I guess your husband
will be showing up any minute, huh?

08:32.057 --> 08:35.823
- No, he's in Mexico.
- On vacation?

08:35.927 --> 08:37.758
No, on his secretary.

08:38.462 --> 08:40.328
But don't worry,
he's not having a good time.

08:40.398 --> 08:43.424
I filled his thong with BenGay.

08:44.736 --> 08:47.136
Remind me to stay
on your good side, Danny.

08:48.306 --> 08:49.671
Will, what's so funny?

08:49.741 --> 08:53.973
It's just that a dude named Danny Mitchell
is my favorite sportswriter.

08:54.712 --> 08:57.738
- Well, you know, I could introduce you.
- Word?

08:57.816 --> 08:59.181
Hey, how you doing?

09:01.319 --> 09:02.946
Y ou're the Danny Mitchell?

09:03.188 --> 09:05.850
Wait, hold it. I heard Charles Barkley
on the radio talking about...

09:05.924 --> 09:07.915
him and Danny was gonna rumble
in the parking lot...

09:07.992 --> 09:09.050
after the Laker game.

09:09.360 --> 09:11.260
He won't show up, that wuss.

09:11.763 --> 09:13.822
All righty, coaches...

09:13.898 --> 09:16.458
let's get our mommies in a comfy position.

09:17.001 --> 09:18.468
- Will?
- What?

09:19.304 --> 09:21.295
That's right. I'm sorry, Aunt Viv.

09:23.241 --> 09:24.799
- That's good.
- Are you all right?

09:25.276 --> 09:28.939
- Y ou need some help there, Danny?
- Why, you got a forklift?

09:30.882 --> 09:32.645
- Will?
- What?

09:32.717 --> 09:35.049
Aren't you forgetting something?

09:35.120 --> 09:37.816
I'm sorry, Aunt Viv. Hey, thanks a lot.

09:40.758 --> 09:42.749
I'll help you, Vivian.

09:44.062 --> 09:46.189
Now, I apologize.

09:46.264 --> 09:50.132
Y ou were right. I have a responsibility,
and I need to be here tonight.

09:50.535 --> 09:51.559
No, you don't.

09:51.636 --> 09:54.730
Y ou just don't want to sleep
on the couch, Philip.

09:54.806 --> 09:57.673
I hate sleeping on that thing. It's all lumpy.

09:57.742 --> 10:01.576
Remember, partners,
lots of touching and hugging.

10:07.085 --> 10:09.713
Show each other how you really feel.

10:12.257 --> 10:15.920
- I showed up, didn't I?
- Y eah, Philip, for all the wrong reasons.

10:15.994 --> 10:17.427
What is your problem, honey?

10:17.495 --> 10:21.022
Having a baby is spiritual, and wonderful,
and miraculous.

10:21.099 --> 10:23.659
It doesn't sound miraculous.
It sounds yucky.

10:23.735 --> 10:25.862
Y ou should have thought
about that seven months ago...

10:25.937 --> 10:29.168
- before that second bottle of wine, Philip.
- Wait a minute.

10:29.240 --> 10:33.677
Vivian. Vivian, wait a minute.
Vivian, come on.

10:33.745 --> 10:35.576
Hey, Uncle Phil, how's your back?

10:37.649 --> 10:41.176
- Are they always like this?
- No, sometimes they fight.

10:42.387 --> 10:44.651
Look, you better go out.
They might need a ref.

10:44.722 --> 10:47.213
No, that's cool.
I'll stay here and help you out.

10:47.292 --> 10:48.316
Great.

10:49.961 --> 10:52.054
Will, I guess I owe you one.

10:52.130 --> 10:55.531
Y ou know what? I am covering
the Laker game on Saturday night.

10:55.600 --> 10:59.468
- Y ou want to watch from the press box?
- From the press box?

11:02.840 --> 11:04.102
Okay, I can't breathe.

11:06.211 --> 11:09.840
Okay, come on. Lie back here.
Okay, take it slow. Take it slow.

11:09.914 --> 11:11.848
Breathe deeply. Breathe deeply.

11:12.650 --> 11:14.777
Okay, focus. Focus with me.

11:29.634 --> 11:32.125
Heck of a game, huh?
Can I get you anything else?

11:32.203 --> 11:34.364
- No, thanks, Tone. This is fine.
- Cool.

11:35.340 --> 11:39.367
- Nothing for you, Will?
- No, thanks.

11:39.444 --> 11:41.309
I'm still tripping over that game.

11:41.379 --> 11:44.348
It was hype. Like, Worthy passes to Vlade.

11:44.415 --> 11:47.407
Vlade back to Byron Scott.
Byron Scott back to Vlade.

11:47.485 --> 11:50.921
Vlade gets the ball back to Worthy.
Worthy gets it, stuffs, pop.

11:50.989 --> 11:54.049
The Lakers win the game!
The Lakers win the game!

11:54.926 --> 11:57.053
Y ou know what the high point
of the game was for me, huh?

11:57.128 --> 12:00.256
What? When you punched Jack Nicholson
in the nose for touching your stomach?

12:03.901 --> 12:05.061
Indigestion.

12:06.137 --> 12:09.629
I guess I shouldn't have had
that third chili dog, huh?

12:14.779 --> 12:16.713
So what's with this free-trade agreement?

12:16.781 --> 12:19.579
They gonna set it up demographically,
or what?

12:20.652 --> 12:22.210
Tony, why aren't you driving?

12:22.287 --> 12:24.721
'Cause nobody else is.
The parking lot's all jammed up.

12:24.789 --> 12:26.984
Y ou gonna eat those fries?

12:29.294 --> 12:32.457
- What? What's the matter?
- My water broke.

12:33.231 --> 12:36.200
That's cool. We got another one,
right here in the fridge.

12:36.701 --> 12:37.690
No, no.

12:38.636 --> 12:41.002
I mean, I think I'm having the baby.

12:42.373 --> 12:46.036
I just had the car cleaned.
Can't you hold it for a couple of hours?

12:49.147 --> 12:51.547
I think that means, "No, Tone."
Do something, man!

12:51.616 --> 12:53.811
Y ou think I got time to Scotchgard?

12:55.453 --> 12:59.685
- The woman's having a baby, you idiot.
- Hey, I have feelings, you know.

12:59.757 --> 13:04.694
- Hey, I'm sorry, Tone. Hey, Tone...
- Will, I need you. Stay.

13:04.762 --> 13:06.753
All right, it's cool, Danny.

13:07.398 --> 13:10.128
All right, I know exactly what to do.

13:11.169 --> 13:15.401
Help! Help!

13:23.648 --> 13:24.637
Help!

13:25.717 --> 13:27.480
Help!

13:28.619 --> 13:31.713
Damn you. I said, "Help!"

13:31.789 --> 13:33.950
Hey, is there a doctor in the parking lot?

13:34.025 --> 13:36.858
- I'm a doctor.
- Thank God.

13:36.928 --> 13:39.294
Look, Doc,
I got a lady in here having a baby.

13:39.364 --> 13:41.696
Y eah, you're going to have to climb
over that car.

13:41.766 --> 13:45.429
That's good. All right, come on.
Wait, yo, look out. Don't, man.

13:51.642 --> 13:53.974
Is there a doctor for the doctor?

13:58.583 --> 14:01.984
- Hey, how's it going, Danny?
- Not too bad.

14:02.053 --> 14:05.887
It's kind of like trying to squeeze
Della Reese out of a Hyundai!

14:07.558 --> 14:10.425
All right, it's cool.
All right, look, I'm calling 911.

14:10.495 --> 14:13.726
911! 911!

14:14.098 --> 14:17.226
Don't bother. We're in wall-to-wall traffic.

14:17.301 --> 14:19.895
No ambulance can get through this.

14:26.544 --> 14:30.105
Wait, here comes another one.
This time you better time me.

14:30.181 --> 14:31.671
All right.

14:36.721 --> 14:39.519
Oh, my God. They're 10 seconds apart.
Y ou're having a baby.

14:39.590 --> 14:40.921
Y ou think?

14:43.594 --> 14:46.791
Danny, all right, look, I know what to do.
I'll call Aunt Viv.

14:46.864 --> 14:49.264
- That's it, she'll know what to do.
- Okay.

14:53.604 --> 14:55.231
- Hello?
- <i>Hi, Wi//.</i>

14:55.306 --> 14:57.934
Wait, slow down. I can't understand you.

14:58.342 --> 15:00.640
No, I don't know where Mom is.

15:00.878 --> 15:02.709
Wait, what's the problem?

15:04.048 --> 15:06.676
Sure. Look, Will,
I don't have time for your little pranks.

15:06.751 --> 15:09.015
I have a date.

15:09.987 --> 15:11.249
What are you doing?

15:11.322 --> 15:14.086
Look, I'm not even playing
that stupid murder game, so...

15:14.158 --> 15:15.887
Look, don't aim that thing at me.

15:15.960 --> 15:17.825
Hilary, are you there?

15:21.466 --> 15:23.161
Well, I hope you're all happy.

15:23.234 --> 15:26.226
Now I'm gonna have a big, ugly, red circle
in the middle of my forehead.

15:26.304 --> 15:28.738
I'll look just like Carlton's
yearbook picture.

15:31.342 --> 15:34.709
Hilary, no, don't hang up! Hilary.

15:36.481 --> 15:41.009
- Danny, what are we gonna do?
- This is unbelievable.

15:41.385 --> 15:44.047
I'm going through all this
in the back of a limo...

15:44.121 --> 15:47.420
because of what went on
in the back of my Jeep.

15:50.027 --> 15:51.517
Wow, I got to get me a Jeep.

15:58.035 --> 16:02.165
Look, Danny,
can you do me, like, one real big favor?

16:02.240 --> 16:05.732
- Sure, what is it?
- Please don't have this baby now!

16:06.177 --> 16:07.804
Relax. Relax.

16:07.879 --> 16:12.111
I took the classes. I read the books.
I can handle it, yeah.

16:12.183 --> 16:15.243
I can't take it! I can't take it!
I can't take it!

16:21.459 --> 16:23.484
Help!

16:23.561 --> 16:26.325
Sorry, buddy,
there ain't no doctor out here.

16:26.397 --> 16:29.093
Hey, man, I don't need a doctor,
I need an exorcist.

16:32.870 --> 16:36.863
Will, there's a bottle of Dom Perignon
over in the bar over there.

16:36.941 --> 16:38.340
Get it.

16:38.509 --> 16:40.374
I don't think so, Danny.

16:40.444 --> 16:43.004
Y ou seem like you might be
kind of a mean drunk.

16:43.881 --> 16:45.041
I don't want to drink it.

16:45.116 --> 16:47.676
I want you to smack me
over the head with it!

16:48.085 --> 16:50.952
- What?
- Just until I pass out.

16:52.356 --> 16:56.087
This baby's on its way,
and I think it's bringing luggage.

16:57.528 --> 17:00.964
It can't be on its way now.
Y ou've only been in labor for 10 minutes.

17:01.032 --> 17:03.626
Tell him. He's coming!

17:03.701 --> 17:07.660
- Get out of my way.
- Wait, Danny, where are you going?

17:08.673 --> 17:09.935
If I run really fast...

17:10.007 --> 17:13.170
I can get back to the Forum
and have my baby on the floor...

17:13.243 --> 17:16.839
- of a ladies' room with some dignity.
- Wait, Danny, wait. Hold on.

17:16.914 --> 17:19.108
All right, you win.
Where's that champagne bottle?

17:20.885 --> 17:22.045
Y o, guess who?

17:22.118 --> 17:24.314
Not now, man.
We got an emergency in here.

17:24.387 --> 17:27.448
Hence, Dr. Finkelbaum.

17:27.625 --> 17:29.422
- Hey, you a doctor, man?
- Y eah.

17:29.493 --> 17:32.291
I love you, man. I love you. Move.

17:32.363 --> 17:34.831
So what seems to be the problem here?

17:35.166 --> 17:38.499
I broke a nail. What the hell do you think?

17:39.270 --> 17:42.728
- Lie back.
- Just relax, Danny. He's here to help you.

17:42.807 --> 17:44.297
Hey, Tone, what took you so long?

17:44.375 --> 17:47.310
I was looking for a doctor,
and I found an M.D. License plate.

17:47.378 --> 17:51.337
I yanked the guy out of his car, and then
I realized M.D. Stands for Mike Ditka.

17:51.916 --> 17:53.781
Fortunately,
the car he threw me up against...

17:53.851 --> 17:56.411
belonged to Dr. Finkelbaum, here.

17:56.487 --> 17:59.422
- Is this the lady having a baby?
- Y eah. Hey, thanks a lot.

17:59.490 --> 18:01.515
Right this way, man.
We got some sodas in the fridge.

18:01.592 --> 18:04.083
I called him from Finkelbaum's car.

18:06.163 --> 18:08.131
I called him from Ditka's car.

18:08.699 --> 18:11.600
Come on in. We got some brews,
a little bit of Malt Duck.

18:13.504 --> 18:15.972
Get this kid out of me.

18:16.340 --> 18:19.503
I got to make a phone call.
I suddenly miss my mother.

18:25.149 --> 18:28.585
Danny, thanks for a wonderful evening.
I'll call you.

18:28.653 --> 18:31.315
Oh, no, Will, don't leave me.

18:33.257 --> 18:36.693
All right, Danny.
I'll stay here, and I'll help you focus.

18:36.761 --> 18:39.787
Focus? I don't want to focus. I want drugs!

18:39.864 --> 18:42.731
Now, get out in that parking lot and score!

18:44.135 --> 18:45.124
Here we go.

18:46.637 --> 18:49.800
It's Danny, isn't it? Bear down.

18:53.978 --> 18:56.776
Danny, think of it
as the World Series, all right?

18:56.847 --> 18:59.338
All right, Alomar is rounding third.
Here comes the throw.

18:59.417 --> 19:03.114
- Slide, Danny, slide.
- Here comes your baby, Danny.

19:03.187 --> 19:04.449
Push!

19:14.565 --> 19:17.500
Here you are, Danny.
A beautiful healthy boy.

19:23.808 --> 19:25.366
Y ou want to hold him?

19:25.443 --> 19:29.345
No. No, thanks. I'll wait till somebody
run him through a car wash or something.

19:32.116 --> 19:35.279
- Come here, man.
- Y eah, calm him down.

19:38.589 --> 19:42.116
Get busy. Put your thing down.
It's your birthday.

19:44.962 --> 19:47.658
It's been one hell of a night, huh, Danny?

19:47.998 --> 19:50.933
And, look,
I went and saved the best for last.

19:51.402 --> 19:53.734
Y es, I did. Y es, I did.

20:03.047 --> 20:05.345
Y o, yo, yo. Anybody home?

20:06.917 --> 20:07.975
Shabba!

20:16.894 --> 20:18.691
Get off me, man.

20:21.031 --> 20:23.898
Uncle Phil, what are you doing
sleeping on the couch?

20:23.968 --> 20:26.766
My chiropractor recommended it.

20:26.904 --> 20:30.305
As you know, Will, I have a separation
in my lower lumbar area...

20:30.407 --> 20:33.308
- and the couch is perfect to align my...
- She threw you out, huh?

20:33.377 --> 20:36.039
Y ou got that right.

20:37.381 --> 20:40.350
- Hear you had a pretty full night, too, huh?
- Oh, man.

20:40.885 --> 20:44.013
Uncle Phil, I got to tell you,
when Danny went into labor, man...

20:44.088 --> 20:47.114
- I was trying to get the heck out of there.
- I heard that.

20:47.525 --> 20:49.015
But then it was, like...

20:49.093 --> 20:54.053
All of a sudden, it was
a little alive wiggly thing, you know?

20:54.265 --> 20:58.258
Ten fingers, and ten toes, and everything.
It was so small.

20:58.903 --> 21:02.999
I was the first person the baby saw,
you know, upside down.

21:04.809 --> 21:08.301
- Sounds like quite an experience, Will.
- It was.

21:10.247 --> 21:12.442
I'm gonna go give Danny a call
at the hospital.

21:12.516 --> 21:15.974
See how little
Jackie Robinson Mitchell is doing, huh?

21:16.053 --> 21:18.214
- Good night, Uncle Phil.
- Good night, Will.

21:20.057 --> 21:23.322
Well, bet you feel like a big dope, huh?

21:28.132 --> 21:30.862
Vivian, I made a decision.

21:33.404 --> 21:36.066
I really want to be in the room
when you give birth.

21:36.740 --> 21:39.072
Not just because you want me there...

21:40.477 --> 21:45.107
but because I want to be the first person
our baby sees upside down.

21:47.251 --> 21:50.516
Philip, that's a beautiful thing to say.

21:51.155 --> 21:55.148
But, I'm afraid, honey,
that I'm gonna have to kill you, anyway.

21:56.861 --> 21:59.455
No, Viv. No, Vivian!

22:08.272 --> 22:11.469
And, look,
I went and saved the best for last.
