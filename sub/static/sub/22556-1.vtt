You have one more minute before

04:39.280 --> 04:41.413
your balance ends.

05:44.711 --> 05:46.411
What?

05:46.879 --> 05:48.413
You like Beth?

05:59.959 --> 06:01.760
This is the kings highway bound

06:01.762 --> 06:03.028
f local train.

06:03.030 --> 06:05.864
The next stop is kings highway.

06:12.004 --> 06:13.638
Luciana Alumbra.

06:25.651 --> 06:27.786
Just need to put your
insurance information

06:27.788 --> 06:28.787
right here please.

06:28.789 --> 06:31.623
I don't have any insurance.

06:31.625 --> 06:34.092
Okay, well it'll be
$75 for the office visit

06:34.094 --> 06:36.661
and we take cash or credit.

06:37.964 --> 06:40.098
Is Dr. Horowitz here?

06:41.067 --> 06:42.601
Yes, he's here today.

06:42.603 --> 06:44.002
Hold on, please.

06:44.004 --> 06:46.471
Good morning, doctor's office.
How may I help you?

06:47.673 --> 06:49.941
What's the last name?

06:49.943 --> 06:52.144
When did you send it?

06:52.146 --> 06:54.980
Okay, I will check.
Hold on, please.

06:54.982 --> 06:58.617
Hey Lisa, do you know
where we keep the referrals

06:58.619 --> 07:01.753
- for Dr. frank?
- I have one on the line now.

07:01.755 --> 07:03.688
Says she sent it last week.

07:04.857 --> 07:06.625
- What?
- Okay.

07:11.998 --> 07:14.466
Dr. Horowitz?

07:15.768 --> 07:17.869
You can't stroll
in here like this.

07:17.871 --> 07:19.104
Please, get out.

07:19.106 --> 07:22.507
Olga sent me.

07:22.509 --> 07:23.942
You can't be here.

07:23.944 --> 07:25.811
Please,
I feel nauseous and Olga...

07:25.813 --> 07:29.714
Olga does not
make my appointments

07:29.716 --> 07:31.716
and this is not a dispensary.

07:31.718 --> 07:32.951
What's that?

07:39.592 --> 07:43.061
You're not going
to leave, are you?

07:44.130 --> 07:45.797
Alright, what's wrong with you?

07:45.799 --> 07:48.767
I told you, I feel dizzy.

07:48.769 --> 07:51.069
You and Olga are friends?

07:51.071 --> 07:53.205
What have you two been up to?

07:53.207 --> 07:55.674
Nothing, I only met her one time

07:55.676 --> 07:58.710
but doctor, I also
get my nose bleeding.

07:58.712 --> 08:01.079
Olga told me you could help me.
Can you help me?

08:01.081 --> 08:03.582
- Have you taken any drugs?
- No.

08:05.084 --> 08:08.153
You can get me in big
trouble showing up like this.

08:08.155 --> 08:09.788
I am a doctor here.

08:09.790 --> 08:13.525
How can you get in trouble
by helping a patient?

08:13.527 --> 08:16.962
You can't be a patient unless
you can pay for the appointment.

08:16.964 --> 08:19.564
Can you pay for the appointment?

08:19.566 --> 08:20.866
No, but I thought that...

08:20.868 --> 08:22.234
I,

08:23.703 --> 08:26.204
Have you told anyone that
you were coming here?

08:26.206 --> 08:27.506
No.

08:28.107 --> 08:29.975
Where were you last night?

08:39.952 --> 08:41.520
Fractured relationship
with Christ,

08:41.522 --> 08:44.054
Genesis, exodus, Deuteronomy,

08:46.659 --> 08:48.260
all tells us, exodus,

08:49.195 --> 08:51.963
of that closeness with god.

08:51.965 --> 08:53.565
They tell us to
prepare for salvation,

08:53.567 --> 08:56.101
to receive the
gift of salvation. Who's ready?

08:56.103 --> 08:58.203
Who wants to receive that gift?
Are you ready?

08:58.205 --> 09:01.139
Are you ready to receive
the gift of salvation?

09:01.141 --> 09:03.742
Are you ready to receive
the gift of salvation?

09:03.744 --> 09:05.911
"All good gifts come from
the father of light."

09:05.913 --> 09:09.247
Saint James 1:17.
What of friends?

09:09.249 --> 09:11.750
We all have friends.
Friends turn on us.

09:11.752 --> 09:13.151
Friends say I'll hold your coat

09:13.153 --> 09:14.219
and then they don't
hold your coat.

09:14.221 --> 09:16.154
But god holds your coat.

09:50.189 --> 09:52.924
Trying to
play me the way you are.

09:52.926 --> 09:54.993
You think it's somebody I trust?

09:54.995 --> 09:56.127
Do you?

09:56.129 --> 09:57.929
Well I don't.

09:57.931 --> 10:00.732
Unless you mean trust the lie,

10:00.734 --> 10:02.233
trust you to steal,

10:02.235 --> 10:05.270
trust you to mess up the
whole god damn operation.

10:05.272 --> 10:06.972
Fuck Radall.

10:06.974 --> 10:09.140
Do not
fuck Radall me, do you hear?

10:09.142 --> 10:12.143
One more excuse out of
you and I'll kill you.

10:12.145 --> 10:14.045
You're overreacting.

10:14.047 --> 10:16.881
Please, baby, put that down,
you don't need that knife.

10:16.883 --> 10:18.283
Put that down, baby.

10:18.285 --> 10:19.918
There you go again,

10:19.920 --> 10:22.053
telling me what I gotta do.

10:22.055 --> 10:24.856
Well, you listen to me,
shit for brains,

10:24.858 --> 10:26.291
I don't gotta to...

10:26.293 --> 10:29.060
Sorry but your card balance

10:29.062 --> 10:30.795
does not allow you to
make a call at this time.

10:30.797 --> 10:33.365
You disgust me, you know that?

10:33.367 --> 10:35.767
Actually, I'd be doing
the world a favor

10:35.769 --> 10:38.870
by removing your
sorry ass from it.

10:38.872 --> 10:40.038
Don't talk anymore.

10:40.040 --> 10:41.640
Just shut the fuck up.

10:41.642 --> 10:44.209
I got to leave.

10:44.211 --> 10:46.911
Something I should have
been doing a long time ago

10:46.913 --> 10:48.880
but it's too damn late for now.

10:55.855 --> 11:00.892
JD, sorry ass, cock sucking,
two timing mother fucker,

11:00.894 --> 11:02.093
I should fuck you up right now.

11:02.095 --> 11:03.662
There you are, baby.

11:03.664 --> 11:05.196
Don't baby me.

11:05.198 --> 11:07.098
I'm so ready to put my
foot so far up your ass,

11:07.100 --> 11:08.667
you think it flew there.

11:08.669 --> 11:10.402
Whoa, I'm calling you Tabasco

11:10.404 --> 11:12.070
'cause you are hot today.

11:12.072 --> 11:14.072
What the fuck is this about?

11:14.074 --> 11:15.807
It's about Tony Lazano.

11:15.809 --> 11:17.909
I can't believe you
ratted me out like that.

11:17.911 --> 11:19.244
He don't know shit.

11:19.246 --> 11:22.213
He does know, I can feel it.

11:22.215 --> 11:23.815
You need to relax.

11:23.817 --> 11:25.216
Look, I got you a
little something.

11:25.218 --> 11:26.951
I don't need your shit.

11:26.953 --> 11:29.220
Oh come on,
you can't be serious.

11:29.222 --> 11:30.955
I'm as serious
as a heart attack.

11:30.957 --> 11:32.424
I'mma bounce you like a check.

11:32.426 --> 11:34.125
Mm uh, you ain't hurting my man.

11:34.127 --> 11:36.127
Shut the fuck up.
I'm not talking to you.

11:36.129 --> 11:38.096
Oh come on, bitches.

13:48.494 --> 13:51.596
Hi, sorry I'm late.
This is Luciana, my friend.

13:51.598 --> 13:54.065
The best chicken
in the big apple.

13:54.067 --> 13:56.201
The best
chicken in the big apple.

13:56.203 --> 13:58.136
The best chicken
in the big apple.

13:58.138 --> 14:00.171
The best chicken
in the big apple.

14:00.173 --> 14:02.307
The best chicken
in the big apple.

14:02.309 --> 14:04.509
The best chicken
in the big apple.

14:04.511 --> 14:06.578
The best chicken
in the big apple.

14:06.580 --> 14:08.513
The best chicken
in the big apple.

14:08.515 --> 14:10.381
The best chicken
in the big apple.

14:10.383 --> 14:11.916
The best chicken
in the big apple.

14:11.918 --> 14:14.385
The best chicken
in the big apple.

14:14.387 --> 14:16.020
I'm so fucking done.

14:30.236 --> 14:32.136
This chicken is
going to attack you.

14:40.446 --> 14:43.047
I'm not doing this again,
that's for sure.

14:45.150 --> 14:46.484
Yeah, one was a cocky asshole

14:46.486 --> 14:48.386
but another one
was kind of cute.

14:48.388 --> 14:50.655
Sounds like you have the
best taste in the world.

14:56.595 --> 14:58.296
Let's go.

15:02.301 --> 15:05.270
I'm so sick of these shit jobs.

15:05.272 --> 15:07.305
Well at
least we get cash, right?

15:07.307 --> 15:09.374
That's what
it says on Craig's list

15:09.376 --> 15:11.342
but you never know.

15:11.344 --> 15:14.145
I wanted to show you,

15:14.147 --> 15:16.581
have you ever
thought about this?

15:18.550 --> 15:21.052
No, I bet what they really want

15:21.054 --> 15:22.921
is to experiment with your eggs.

15:22.923 --> 15:24.322
I know but it says for research.

15:24.324 --> 15:27.525
No, I don't trust those places.

15:30.195 --> 15:34.198
Look, there must
be something behind

15:34.200 --> 15:36.034
why they pay so much money.

15:45.110 --> 15:47.612
I'm so tired of
the possibilities.

15:47.614 --> 15:50.581
The possibilities
are why we're here.

15:52.217 --> 15:55.219
Sometimes I think I could
end up homeless on the street.

15:55.221 --> 15:57.455
I wonder how those
people got there.

15:57.457 --> 15:59.090
Don't be so dramatic.

15:59.092 --> 16:00.491
You can always go back
to your nice country.

16:00.493 --> 16:02.293
No, I can't.

16:02.295 --> 16:04.362
Well, you won't be
able to come back here

16:04.364 --> 16:06.597
but you can like
living there, right?

16:06.599 --> 16:07.966
No, I can't.

16:09.234 --> 16:11.636
Why can't you, the
economical crisis?

16:11.638 --> 16:15.606
Mmhmm, it's so bad over
there now, I know, I know

16:15.608 --> 16:18.209
but here look, you
have so many options.

16:18.211 --> 16:21.112
Anything is possible
in New York.

16:25.184 --> 16:28.219
Those street people,
they're just drug addicts

16:28.221 --> 16:30.221
or they came out of jail.

16:30.223 --> 16:31.589
They're just bad people.

16:31.591 --> 16:32.991
Maybe they just had bad luck.

16:32.993 --> 16:34.525
There's no such
thing as bad luck.

16:34.527 --> 16:36.127
We all get what we deserve.

16:36.129 --> 16:38.062
What do you really think that?

16:38.064 --> 16:39.530
That's such a
horrible thing to say.

16:39.532 --> 16:41.265
If you do some bad shit,

16:41.267 --> 16:43.134
eventually, something bad
is going to happen to you

16:43.136 --> 16:47.405
and that's what Jesus
and god are there for,

16:47.407 --> 16:49.607
to put bad girls
like us in hell.

16:51.410 --> 16:52.744
Trust me.

16:59.118 --> 17:01.352
I bet there's an asshole in
Spain who broke your heart.

17:01.354 --> 17:03.354
Shut up.

17:04.390 --> 17:08.026
I don't let them use me,
I use them.

17:08.028 --> 17:10.161
Men are all the same.

17:10.163 --> 17:11.329
If I stayed in my country now,

17:11.330 --> 17:12.597
I would be like my sister,

17:12.598 --> 17:14.699
married to drunk husband
with three children.

17:14.701 --> 17:16.401
And she's my younger sister.

17:16.403 --> 17:19.436
I cannot stand her
husband or their children,

17:19.439 --> 17:21.305
they're so demanding.

17:21.307 --> 17:22.740
I can't deal with kids,

17:22.742 --> 17:24.242
not even babies,

17:24.243 --> 17:27.178
so freaking annoying.

17:27.180 --> 17:29.447
When I first got here,
I took a job as a nanny.

17:29.449 --> 17:30.515
I quit the first day.

17:30.517 --> 17:32.183
The freaking baby

17:32.185 --> 17:35.386
was crying and crying
and crying all the time.

17:35.388 --> 17:37.789
- She drove me crazy.
- Shut the fuck up!

17:44.196 --> 17:46.097
You're so fucked up.

17:47.232 --> 17:48.666
Yeah.

18:01.447 --> 18:04.148
So did you go to the doctor?

18:04.750 --> 18:06.317
He's such a jerk

18:06.319 --> 18:08.686
but he gave you pills, right?

18:09.755 --> 18:12.490
He told me I was
having a panic attack.

18:15.627 --> 18:17.395
Here, take these.

18:17.397 --> 18:19.130
They're the best to chill.

18:19.132 --> 18:21.833
I get anxious too
sometimes, you know?

18:22.768 --> 18:24.168
What's this?

18:24.170 --> 18:25.136
It doesn't even have a label.

18:25.138 --> 18:26.471
Take, they will help.

18:26.473 --> 18:28.239
Are you crazy?
I'm not gonna take this crap.

18:28.241 --> 18:29.440
Your loss.

18:35.681 --> 18:37.715
Does that taste good?

18:46.525 --> 18:48.226
I was a good model,

18:50.696 --> 18:53.464
the best agency in Moscow

18:55.534 --> 18:58.736
but now there's
nothing for me there.

18:59.605 --> 19:02.406
Did you come here alone too?

19:02.408 --> 19:05.309
No, with two other models.

19:05.311 --> 19:07.712
So what happened to them?

19:09.381 --> 19:12.517
I don't know, I lost track.

19:13.685 --> 19:15.620
New York ate them.

19:21.327 --> 19:24.695
Oh fuck, oh no, no, please no.

19:24.697 --> 19:26.764
- Shit.
- What happened?

19:28.300 --> 19:30.601
So I get a text from this
woman I work for sometimes

19:30.603 --> 19:32.770
but I can't do it today.

19:36.475 --> 19:38.609
Do you want to go in my place?

19:38.611 --> 19:40.378
Sure, what's that about?

19:40.380 --> 19:41.679
She needs pretty woman

19:41.681 --> 19:43.614
to be hanging around
at the cocktail party.

19:43.616 --> 19:45.316
It's just something silly

19:45.318 --> 19:46.717
but she pays really well.

19:46.719 --> 19:47.752
Cash?

19:47.754 --> 19:49.620
Cash, $2,000 the first night.

19:49.622 --> 19:50.821
They give you right after.

19:50.823 --> 19:52.723
What, $2,000 to be in a party...

19:52.725 --> 19:54.559
$4,000 if they ask
you to come back.

19:54.561 --> 19:55.860
What?

19:55.862 --> 19:57.261
You're joking.

19:57.263 --> 19:58.729
That's absolutely impossible.

19:58.731 --> 20:00.665
And it is not what
you're thinking.

20:00.667 --> 20:03.935
You don't have to do anything
you don't want to do.

20:05.571 --> 20:06.904
That is unbelievable.

20:06.906 --> 20:09.740
Yes, yes, that is New York baby.

20:09.742 --> 20:10.608
Really?

20:10.610 --> 20:12.243
Yes, yes.

20:12.245 --> 20:16.447
So you are going to
go to this address.

20:16.449 --> 20:18.516
I mean I wish
I could but I can't

20:18.518 --> 20:19.784
so you will go.

20:19.786 --> 20:22.587
And it's okay that
I go to replace you?

20:22.589 --> 20:24.555
Sure, okay come on.

20:26.358 --> 20:27.792
Hello, Diana.

20:30.529 --> 20:31.929
Okay, yes it's totally cool.

20:31.931 --> 20:34.565
You need to wear a black
short dress and high heels.

20:34.567 --> 20:36.801
Let me see what you
have on the phone.

20:57.656 --> 20:59.757
- Is this okay?
- Those are totally fine, yes.

20:59.759 --> 20:59.757
So you need to go now,

20:59.759 --> 21:02.960
you need to be there by seven.
That's when the guests arrive.

21:02.962 --> 21:04.362
Okay.

21:04.364 --> 21:05.663
And it's okay that
I don't have papers?

21:05.665 --> 21:06.697
Yes, it's totally fine.

21:06.699 --> 21:08.399
They only need people like us.

21:08.401 --> 21:10.601
Just go to the address
I gave you dressed right,

21:10.603 --> 21:11.602
it'll work.

21:11.604 --> 21:12.670
This my friend Diana.

21:12.672 --> 21:13.938
She doesn't speak English yet.

21:13.940 --> 21:15.806
- Luciana.
- Nice to meet you.

21:15.808 --> 21:18.442
Nice to meet you, hi, hi, hi.

21:18.444 --> 21:19.644
Tell your friend
she's beautiful.

21:19.646 --> 21:21.679
I know, right,
isn't she gorgeous?

21:21.681 --> 21:22.947
Today she's beautiful,

21:22.949 --> 21:24.682
tomorrow she'll be
wearing a chicken suit.

22:02.721 --> 22:04.055
May I help you?

22:04.890 --> 22:06.691
I just want to try this dress.

22:06.693 --> 22:07.958
Well through there.

22:07.960 --> 22:09.694
Let me know if
you need anything.

22:09.696 --> 22:10.895
Thank you.

23:03.882 --> 23:05.649
So how'd it look?

23:05.651 --> 23:08.753
Oh, great but look, there is
a piece broken in the dress.

23:08.755 --> 23:10.588
Oh, I didn't even notice.

23:10.590 --> 23:13.891
Let me see if there's
another one in your size.

23:26.505 --> 23:29.473
No sorry, unfortunately
this is the last one.

23:29.475 --> 23:30.808
You cannot sell this to me?

23:30.810 --> 23:32.610
I can't sell this dress,
it's ripped.

23:32.612 --> 23:33.911
Yeah, I have $20.

23:33.913 --> 23:36.113
Nobody's gonna buy it,
it's broken already.

23:46.124 --> 23:47.758
Sorry.

25:07.607 --> 25:10.674
You have five
new voice messages.

25:10.676 --> 25:12.643
Hi Luciana.
I'm sorry, I forgot to tell you

25:12.645 --> 25:14.078
but I have a meeting at work

25:14.080 --> 25:15.679
and I really need you
to pick up the children.

25:15.681 --> 25:17.047
I already called the school

25:17.049 --> 25:18.716
so they're gonna be
waiting for you now.

25:18.718 --> 25:20.651
When you get home,
if you could do me a favor.

25:20.653 --> 25:21.986
Shit!

25:35.967 --> 25:37.935
- Sorry.
- You are late.

25:37.937 --> 25:39.637
I know, I'm sorry.

25:39.639 --> 25:41.872
You promised ice cream
but the truck already left.

25:41.874 --> 25:43.073
You came so late.

25:43.075 --> 25:44.975
I know, I'm so sorry, kids.

25:44.977 --> 25:46.944
Hey listen, please don't
tell anything to their mom.

25:46.946 --> 25:48.112
Oh, it's fine.

25:48.114 --> 25:49.847
Alright, little warriors,

25:49.849 --> 25:50.848
see you next week.

25:50.850 --> 25:52.283
Ah!

25:52.951 --> 25:53.951
Right now.

25:53.953 --> 25:54.818
You know what,

25:54.820 --> 25:55.653
I'm getting you ice cream.

25:55.655 --> 25:55.653
You know from where?

25:55.655 --> 25:55.653
- From the deli.
- My mommy's not

25:55.655 --> 25:59.290
gonna be happy you
came late again.

25:59.292 --> 26:01.292
She's gonna hire
another babysitter,

26:01.294 --> 26:02.927
- a better one.
- Well, that's very mean.

26:02.929 --> 26:03.994
That's very mean.

26:05.297 --> 26:06.297
Let's go.

26:09.301 --> 26:10.167
Yeah!

26:10.169 --> 26:12.102
Quiet, okay?

26:12.104 --> 26:14.004
Tell me, what would you like?

26:14.006 --> 26:15.940
I want strawberry.

26:15.942 --> 26:17.875
Me too, that's what I want.

26:17.877 --> 26:19.076
Two of you, strawberry.
You're sure?

26:19.078 --> 26:19.076
You're not gonna
change your mind?

26:19.078 --> 26:22.012
- Strawberry minis. -Okay, let
me see if they have that.

26:22.014 --> 26:23.314
I want minis.

26:23.316 --> 26:25.316
Well, they don't have it
so you're getting this.

26:25.318 --> 26:26.684
I don't like it.

26:26.686 --> 26:27.851
Vanilla,

26:27.853 --> 26:30.220
- yeah, there you go.
- No.

26:30.222 --> 26:32.089
What, don't do that Julie.

26:32.091 --> 26:34.892
You get your ice cream.
That's disrespectful, okay?

26:34.894 --> 26:36.093
No, I don't.

26:36.095 --> 26:38.228
I don't want the ice cream.

26:38.230 --> 26:39.330
Me too.

26:39.332 --> 26:41.966
I don't want the
ice cream at all.

26:41.968 --> 26:44.001
Well you were begging
me for ice cream,

26:44.003 --> 26:46.971
now you got ice cream.
Don't be disrespectful.

26:46.973 --> 26:48.138
I didn't want it from the deli.

26:48.140 --> 26:49.139
Come over here, come over here.

26:49.141 --> 26:50.874
- No!
- Sorry, Seth,

26:50.876 --> 26:52.109
the mother
didn't give me money today.

26:52.111 --> 26:53.611
It's okay if I
pay you on Friday?

26:53.613 --> 26:54.778
That's fine, that's fine.

26:54.780 --> 26:55.980
Okay, thank you so much.

26:55.982 --> 26:57.147
Alright, we are moving now.

26:57.149 --> 26:58.816
We're going to the truck.

26:58.818 --> 26:59.950
- Luciana.
- -Yeah?

26:59.952 --> 27:01.285
Here you go.

27:01.287 --> 27:03.287
- Oh, thank you so much.
- You're welcome.

27:03.289 --> 27:03.287
- Goodbye.
- Bye guys.

27:03.289 --> 27:05.356
- Have a good day.
- Thank you.

27:05.358 --> 27:06.624
Alright, come on.

27:09.260 --> 27:10.761
Come on.

27:12.063 --> 27:13.964
You can walk faster than that.

27:15.300 --> 27:17.835
Come on, Julie, don't
be so difficult.

27:17.837 --> 27:19.203
Look what you did!

27:19.205 --> 27:20.838
I'm sorry, I'm sorry honey,

27:20.840 --> 27:21.872
I'm so sorry, love.

27:21.874 --> 27:23.173
Go buy me another one.

27:23.175 --> 27:24.808
I don't have any money.

27:24.810 --> 27:25.843
I'm sorry.

27:25.845 --> 27:27.177
You're a witch, I hate you

27:27.179 --> 27:28.646
and you never have any money.

27:28.648 --> 27:31.115
Sorry, hey, what
are you doing Matthew?

27:32.117 --> 27:34.184
- Sorry miss.
- Wait, stop with that.

27:35.087 --> 27:37.988
Julie, wait, Julie!

27:39.024 --> 27:40.224
What are you doing
now sitting down?

27:40.226 --> 27:42.726
Hey, get up, come on.

27:42.728 --> 27:45.796
Come on, don't be,
what are you doing?

27:45.798 --> 27:47.264
Crazy, just come.

27:51.202 --> 27:52.836
Where is the child?

27:52.838 --> 27:54.071
What the fuck
are you talking about?

27:54.073 --> 27:55.339
She ran in front of the car.

27:55.341 --> 27:57.107
You crazy woman!

27:57.809 --> 27:59.176
You crazy!

28:02.080 --> 28:04.415
Oh my god, what's gonna happen?

28:04.417 --> 28:06.717
You keep looking, okay?

28:10.088 --> 28:11.221
Have you seen Julie?

28:11.223 --> 28:13.891
She hates that park.

28:13.893 --> 28:16.093
His sister, have you seen here?

28:16.095 --> 28:17.094
No.

28:17.096 --> 28:18.262
Is she kinda like...

28:18.264 --> 28:21.098
Blonde, yeah, she's lost.

28:21.100 --> 28:23.100
What if somebody stole her?

28:23.102 --> 28:26.070
Don't say, you're scaring me.

28:28.206 --> 28:30.107
What if she's at home?

28:30.109 --> 28:31.375
What if she...

28:31.377 --> 28:34.144
I think she's
probably gonna be there.

28:34.146 --> 28:36.246
Let's just go there.

28:46.858 --> 28:48.125
She's not here either.

28:48.127 --> 28:50.761
You lost my sister.
You're gonna go to jail.

28:58.136 --> 29:00.237
Luciana, you're bleeding.

29:06.010 --> 29:08.979
Luciana, look who I found

29:08.981 --> 29:11.181
- behind the bush.
- Thank god.

29:11.183 --> 29:12.816
Thank you, Mrs. bellman.

29:12.818 --> 29:15.919
We were playing hide and seek
and it got late.

29:15.921 --> 29:17.254
Time to go home, right?

29:17.256 --> 29:18.856
Well, everybody's home now.
Nice to see you.

29:18.858 --> 29:22.960
Excuse me, may I ask
you for a huge favor?

29:22.962 --> 29:22.960
Sure.

29:22.962 --> 29:22.960
I'm just running
late for another job

29:22.962 --> 29:26.029
that I have to do right now

29:26.031 --> 29:26.029
and I was wondering if maybe...

29:26.031 --> 29:29.500
Oh sure, you want
me to hang on to 'em

29:29.502 --> 29:31.034
- till the mother gets home?
- Would that be a problem?

29:31.036 --> 29:32.936
No problem.

29:32.938 --> 29:36.540
I've got vinyl covered
furniture and cookies.

29:36.542 --> 29:38.075
Yes, cookies!

29:38.077 --> 29:38.075
In the fridge.

29:38.077 --> 29:40.844
- Thank you so much.
- No problem.

29:43.114 --> 29:46.850
You don't ever do
this again, okay?

30:10.809 --> 30:12.409
You know, Bayer street?

30:19.450 --> 30:21.151
65 Bayer.

30:21.953 --> 30:23.253
That one?

30:43.408 --> 30:45.909
Excuse me, is the party here?

30:47.378 --> 30:49.112
Are you looking for Mr. so?

30:49.114 --> 30:50.247
I don't know.

30:50.249 --> 30:51.515
They told me this address.

30:51.517 --> 30:53.917
I'm working at
the party tonight.

31:03.995 --> 31:06.330
Come in, other girls
already at the party.

31:09.434 --> 31:10.534
Come.

31:36.561 --> 31:38.028
Okay, yeah.

32:13.197 --> 32:15.265
Hey, hey, hey, no bag.

32:16.234 --> 32:18.068
- What?
- No bag.

32:18.070 --> 32:20.604
You have to get rid
of it before you go.

32:20.606 --> 32:23.206
My bag, but what am
I gonna do with my bag?

32:23.208 --> 32:25.409
You are not
allowed to bring bag.

32:25.411 --> 32:28.545
Okay, is the party here?

32:30.348 --> 32:31.548
You are new?

32:31.550 --> 32:35.319
No, I'm a very
good professional.

32:44.529 --> 32:46.263
When will I get paid?

32:46.265 --> 32:49.366
You get paid when you are done.

32:52.570 --> 32:54.037
Wait here.

32:57.508 --> 32:59.376
Where is the party?

32:59.378 --> 33:00.644
No, no, no, no.

33:03.748 --> 33:05.682
No cell phone, please.

33:05.684 --> 33:09.152
Okay, I don't even
have any credit.

33:09.154 --> 33:10.587
Okay, okay.

33:11.489 --> 33:13.557
Okay, this is for you.

33:13.559 --> 33:15.425

You cannot take bag in.

33:42.755 --> 33:44.454
Get rid of it!

34:55.827 --> 34:57.761
Which side I stop?

34:57.763 --> 35:00.831
To the right,
a little bit farther.

35:02.667 --> 35:04.534
You have to pay 17.

35:04.536 --> 35:07.370
You have no money,
why you take the taxi?

35:07.372 --> 35:10.407
I was in a rush and I didn't
realize I didn't have money.

35:10.409 --> 35:11.641
No, no, you have to pay.

35:11.643 --> 35:13.777
I can just go outside,

35:13.779 --> 35:15.712
- get money.
- Okay, time is money.

36:20.578 --> 36:22.913
I'm sorry, I'm not gonna
be able to pay you tonight.

36:22.915 --> 36:25.315
It's okay if you
give me your number

36:25.317 --> 36:26.416
and I pay you tomorrow?

36:26.418 --> 36:27.851
I'll have money tomorrow.

38:19.830 --> 38:21.064
Hey, I'm sorry I'm late.

38:21.066 --> 38:23.767
I'm working at
the party tonight.

38:25.002 --> 38:27.370
Take your place with the others.

38:42.386 --> 38:44.020
Sorry, I've never
been here before.

38:44.022 --> 38:47.057
Olga told me she couldn't come
so I'm taking her place.

38:47.059 --> 38:48.925
Olga's right over there.

38:48.927 --> 38:50.960
Why don't you go say hello?

39:03.474 --> 39:06.876
Olga, I thought I was
coming here to substitute you.

39:10.114 --> 39:12.415
Olga, what's going on?

39:12.417 --> 39:14.117
Why aren't you looking at me?

39:16.554 --> 39:18.021
The guests are here.

39:18.023 --> 39:19.889
They don't allow us to
speak when they are around.

39:19.891 --> 39:21.725
Take your place. Come.

40:44.141 --> 40:46.776
Welcome, everyone.

40:46.778 --> 40:49.579
I hope you are enjoying
your evening so far

40:49.581 --> 40:51.815
and of course,

40:51.817 --> 40:54.784
the stunning selection
of brave women.

40:57.621 --> 41:02.158
A number of whom you have
seen and enjoyed before.

41:06.130 --> 41:09.499
We also welcome a fresh face...

41:11.035 --> 41:14.003
Or two to test your luck on.

41:14.005 --> 41:17.207
I trust that you have
already made your selections

41:18.042 --> 41:20.643
but if not, please do.

41:20.645 --> 41:22.779
There isn't time to waste.

41:22.781 --> 41:24.180
Choose your numbers

41:24.182 --> 41:26.182
and we will move
to the game room.

41:26.184 --> 41:28.051
Shall we?

42:08.092 --> 42:09.859
Olga.

42:23.207 --> 42:25.074
Mai.

42:33.884 --> 42:35.618
I am ready.

42:37.221 --> 42:38.922
Much better.

42:40.758 --> 42:43.326
Smile, be pretty.

43:09.720 --> 43:12.155
What the hell is this?

43:12.157 --> 43:14.958
Why are you doing this to me?

43:14.960 --> 43:18.261
Listen, I got you here,

43:18.263 --> 43:20.029
that's all.

43:20.031 --> 43:23.032
You wanted money, here you are.

43:44.221 --> 43:45.955
Where are you going?

43:45.957 --> 43:46.956
It's not your turn yet.

43:46.958 --> 43:48.124
What's going on there?

43:48.126 --> 43:49.292
Get back with the others.

43:49.294 --> 43:50.927
I just want to
know what this is.

43:50.929 --> 43:52.161
Go back to your number.

43:52.163 --> 43:53.963
Sorry, I'm leaving.

43:53.965 --> 43:55.264
You're not going anywhere.

43:55.266 --> 43:57.400
I'm not working at this party

43:57.402 --> 43:59.235
or whatever this is.

43:59.237 --> 44:00.303
Really?

44:04.141 --> 44:07.143
You are making
things worse for yourself.

46:31.088 --> 46:34.957
Those of you who
have been here before,

46:34.959 --> 46:37.059
thank you for returning.

46:37.061 --> 46:40.830
And those of you who have
been here for the first time,

46:40.832 --> 46:43.166
I hope it is not the last.

47:16.099 --> 47:21.304
Change your face and look
like you're at a party, huh?

47:30.214 --> 47:32.582
It is a party, right girls?

47:34.384 --> 47:38.221
And you are all being paid very
handsomely to attend it, no?

47:43.227 --> 47:46.195
Alina, lovely to see you again.

47:47.197 --> 47:48.497
Shall we?

48:35.445 --> 48:37.580
Can you please stop that?
What do you want?

48:37.582 --> 48:39.649
What's in the purse?

48:47.291 --> 48:49.292
Can anyone tell me?

49:02.172 --> 49:04.040
Could I go to the bathroom?

49:23.660 --> 49:25.428
There, be quick.

50:07.305 --> 50:09.071
Sorry, just finishing up.

50:09.073 --> 50:10.740
What the
fuck did I say? Hurry up.

50:30.694 --> 50:33.796
I need your help.
Could you come in?

50:34.464 --> 50:36.499
What?

50:37.200 --> 50:38.801
What do you need?

50:44.207 --> 50:45.608
Hey.

50:45.610 --> 50:46.742
Hey.

50:52.382 --> 50:54.617
Do you think you can help me?

50:55.419 --> 50:57.753
- Help you?
- Yeah.

51:00.057 --> 51:02.124
What do you mean like...

51:02.759 --> 51:04.660
Get out of here.

51:05.295 --> 51:06.462
You want me to,

51:06.464 --> 51:08.664
you want to get out
of here with me?

51:08.666 --> 51:10.399
Yeah.

51:16.606 --> 51:18.774
We can maybe do that.

51:27.851 --> 51:30.152
I'll do you right here.

51:33.323 --> 51:34.723
Fucking slut...

51:34.725 --> 51:37.493
Get the fuck off me, you
mother fucking piece of shit!

51:37.495 --> 51:38.694
Pig sucker!

51:41.765 --> 51:45.501
Listen to me, you fucking
cock teasing immigrant bitch.

51:45.503 --> 51:46.802
I don't know what the fuck
you think you're doing

51:46.804 --> 51:48.737
or what fucking language
you're doing it in

51:48.739 --> 51:51.774
but I can snap your fucking
windpipe like a toothpick.

51:51.776 --> 51:53.776
I'll break your jaw
into 50 fucking pieces.

51:53.778 --> 51:57.446
See how good you look
in that dress then, huh?

51:58.849 --> 52:00.382
I'm sorry.

52:00.384 --> 52:03.185
I'll fucking make you sorry.

52:30.680 --> 52:32.715
You have fun?

53:44.888 --> 53:46.589
What if I never come back?

53:46.591 --> 53:47.890
It's better if we
don't think about that.

53:47.892 --> 53:48.757
How can I not?

53:48.759 --> 53:50.326
That could have been me.

53:50.328 --> 53:51.927
But it's not,
you're fine, you're here,

53:51.929 --> 53:53.629
we're all fine.

53:53.631 --> 53:54.964
We'll be fine.

53:57.367 --> 53:59.401
Calm down, no,

53:59.403 --> 54:01.537
calm down, you'll be fine.

54:01.539 --> 54:02.938
I just got to go.

54:06.776 --> 54:08.877
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

54:08.879 --> 54:11.513
Get back, get back.
I want to go, please.

54:12.783 --> 54:14.950
Please, just let me go.

54:15.852 --> 54:16.919
I can't.

54:22.592 --> 54:24.994
What is happening in here?

54:24.996 --> 54:26.495
Who is screaming?

54:26.497 --> 54:28.030
She freaked out.

54:29.299 --> 54:31.400
I need you in the back, go.

54:34.537 --> 54:36.372
Olga,

54:38.041 --> 54:40.876
what is wrong with you?

54:42.312 --> 54:44.813
What kind of women are
you bringing to me?

54:44.815 --> 54:46.315
Huh?

54:47.684 --> 54:50.753
Evidently, I cannot
trust you any longer.

54:53.790 --> 54:56.425
I do the best I can.

54:56.427 --> 54:58.761
Really, the best you can?

55:00.664 --> 55:03.365
We will talk about this later.

55:50.113 --> 55:51.780
If anyone feels
like freaking out,

55:51.782 --> 55:53.449
you should probably
take one of these.

55:53.451 --> 55:56.118
- Apparently, I'm a babysitter.
- I'll take it.

56:01.791 --> 56:02.958
Anyone else?

56:03.660 --> 56:05.661
What the fuck? Hey!

56:05.663 --> 56:06.962
How much does she pay you?

56:06.964 --> 56:08.364
None of your fucking business.

56:08.366 --> 56:09.698
You said nobody
here'd be touched.

56:09.700 --> 56:11.100
We're working,
they should respect us.

56:11.102 --> 56:12.634
We should be
treated with dignity.

56:12.636 --> 56:14.036
You think there's
dignity in this?

56:14.038 --> 56:15.771
What third world shit
country do you come from?

56:15.773 --> 56:17.940
You should work in an
office, miss dignity,

56:17.942 --> 56:21.110
and you, why don't you go back
to the shit hole I found you in?

56:22.045 --> 56:24.847
Hey no, no, no, no, no, no!

56:43.666 --> 56:46.668
My guests wish
for you to be next.

56:46.670 --> 56:48.036
What is your name?

56:48.038 --> 56:50.672
Luciana.

56:50.674 --> 56:53.442
I don't think we've
had one of your kind before.

56:53.444 --> 56:55.811
Olga didn't tell
me what I have to do.

56:55.813 --> 56:56.979
What do I have to do?

56:56.981 --> 56:59.014
Nothing but what you're told.

56:59.016 --> 57:01.817
And if anything
unfortunate happens,

57:01.819 --> 57:04.987
well, we make our own luck.

57:08.691 --> 57:10.726
What if I'm
uncomfortable with it?

57:10.728 --> 57:12.661
You're here to make money,

57:12.663 --> 57:13.862
you'll figure it out.

57:13.864 --> 57:15.664
But remember,

57:15.666 --> 57:18.534
do not mention to anyone
what you've seen here tonight.

57:18.536 --> 57:21.770
And I am telling you
that for your safety.

57:24.607 --> 57:27.009
You have been chosen to be next.

57:28.111 --> 57:31.580
And I have chosen
Olga to play with you.

57:33.016 --> 57:36.852
And I'm sure you trust the
person you brought here tonight

57:36.854 --> 57:39.721
so I'm sure the game
will turn out just fine.

57:44.127 --> 57:46.762
I'll be back to escort you both

57:46.764 --> 57:49.131
after our guests have
placed their bets.

57:49.133 --> 57:51.600
So until then,

57:52.469 --> 57:53.936
think pleasant thoughts.

58:13.890 --> 58:15.057
It's okay.

58:16.125 --> 58:19.561
It's alright, don't worry,
don't be afraid.

58:20.163 --> 58:21.964
Just relax.

58:25.802 --> 58:27.870
Do you believe in god?

58:28.771 --> 58:30.272
I used to.

58:30.274 --> 58:31.974
Respire,

58:35.645 --> 58:37.646
it's going to be alright.

58:38.248 --> 58:39.915
Don't be afraid.

59:08.111 --> 59:10.879
Give your purse to Brian.

59:36.239 --> 59:37.739
Shall we begin?

59:37.741 --> 59:39.241
Brian.

59:43.680 --> 59:46.915
What you see here
is a Chilean recluse,

59:46.917 --> 59:50.018
a very rare and illegal species.

59:51.254 --> 59:54.022
Although she is
not large in size,

59:54.024 --> 59:56.892
she is deceptively deadly.

59:56.894 --> 59:58.794
Her bite is extremely painful

59:58.796 --> 01:00:02.097
and her dermonecrotic venom
will dissolve the flesh

01:00:02.099 --> 01:00:03.865
right off your bone.

01:00:03.867 --> 01:00:07.002
And if you are unfortunate
enough to survive her bite,

01:00:07.004 --> 01:00:09.137
you'll be left in agonizing pain

01:00:09.139 --> 01:00:11.273
for the rest of your life.

01:00:11.275 --> 01:00:14.776
So I must emphasize that
everyone stay as still

01:00:14.778 --> 01:00:18.013
and as quiet as possible.

01:00:24.721 --> 01:00:29.291
Tonight, as we discussed,
something different.

01:00:29.293 --> 01:00:31.293
Two girls,

01:00:31.295 --> 01:00:34.096
Luciana and Olga,
will alternate.

01:00:35.098 --> 01:00:38.000
The guests have already
made their bets.

01:00:38.002 --> 01:00:41.370
Two rounds, one for each girl,

01:00:42.105 --> 01:00:44.206
two minutes each round.

01:00:46.075 --> 01:00:50.045
Ladies, what will be fun
and different for us tonight

01:00:50.047 --> 01:00:53.215
is while one of you
is in the coffin,

01:00:53.217 --> 01:00:58.053
the other will be standing
by also sharing the risk.

01:00:58.055 --> 01:01:01.156
The guests and
I already agreed earlier

01:01:01.158 --> 01:01:04.693
that the spider on
the girl in the coffin

01:01:04.695 --> 01:01:08.196
must remain skin contact
for the full round.

01:01:08.198 --> 01:01:10.232
If it wanders off the skin,

01:01:10.234 --> 01:01:12.367
it will be the second girls task

01:01:12.369 --> 01:01:15.037
to be brave enough
to guide it back

01:01:15.039 --> 01:01:17.305
with the help of a stick.

01:01:19.208 --> 01:01:23.979
But, your presence may effect
the spider's reactions.

01:01:23.981 --> 01:01:26.314
You must work well together.

01:01:27.116 --> 01:01:29.184
We all wish you good luck,

01:01:30.019 --> 01:01:32.154
at least some of us do.

01:01:34.457 --> 01:01:35.957
Walk to the coffin

01:01:35.959 --> 01:01:37.959
and remove your clothes.

01:01:37.961 --> 01:01:42.330
Remain calm and elegant as
you lie inside face down.

01:01:43.366 --> 01:01:46.001
Our guests are here
to look at you.

01:01:46.003 --> 01:01:47.436
Keep that in mind.

01:04:46.015 --> 01:04:47.415
Time.

01:04:59.295 --> 01:05:01.229
Nicely done.

01:05:01.231 --> 01:05:03.999
You may get dressed
but do not go anywhere.

01:05:20.182 --> 01:05:23.385
Alright, everyone,
let's continue.

01:05:23.387 --> 01:05:25.453
It's Olga's round.

01:05:37.934 --> 01:05:42.070
Our lives hang by
a delicate thread

01:05:42.072 --> 01:05:46.074
and sometimes we can
pull on that thread.

01:05:47.476 --> 01:05:50.011
It is so exciting, isn't it?

01:05:53.716 --> 01:05:55.450
Shall we begin?

01:06:07.630 --> 01:06:10.598
Meet the Brazilian
wandering spider.

01:06:10.600 --> 01:06:15.036
She is very aggressive
and highly unpredictable.

01:06:16.639 --> 01:06:20.342
If she decides to bite,
she'll do it repeatedly

01:06:20.344 --> 01:06:23.645
until the full dose of
her venom is delivered.

01:06:23.647 --> 01:06:27.716
Muscle paralysis will be
the result ending in death

01:06:27.718 --> 01:06:29.451
by asphyxiation.

01:06:30.619 --> 01:06:34.122
Oh, there is no anti-venom
here in the states.

01:06:51.307 --> 01:06:53.008
Olga.

01:09:00.603 --> 01:09:02.737
Take it off of me, please.

01:09:06.774 --> 01:09:10.478
Please, please take
it off of me, please.

01:09:11.479 --> 01:09:13.680
Take it off of me, please.

01:09:16.519 --> 01:09:17.719
Take it off.

01:09:20.689 --> 01:09:21.756
Please.

01:09:28.464 --> 01:09:29.898
Please.

01:09:32.434 --> 01:09:34.234
Please.

01:09:35.437 --> 01:09:36.703
Please.

01:10:04.633 --> 01:10:06.267
Time.

01:10:14.743 --> 01:10:18.346
The spider maintained
skin contact two minutes.

01:10:18.348 --> 01:10:20.815
Bets placed on both girls paid.

01:10:41.737 --> 01:10:45.573
I think I just
found your replacement.

01:10:58.420 --> 01:11:01.789
I like you but remember,

01:11:01.791 --> 01:11:04.325
we don't come here
to make friends.

01:11:22.578 --> 01:11:24.746
There you go.

01:13:06.749 --> 01:13:10.151
Thank you.
