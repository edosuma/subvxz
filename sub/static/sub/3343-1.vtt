01:40.760 --> 01:42.680
So I'm gonna get
a three-to-one return on my money?

01:42.720 --> 01:47.720
Man: Otto is the reaI deaI.
I met him at a hash bar in Amsterdam.

01:47.760 --> 01:50.560
He speaks Russian, German, Arabic...

01:52.160 --> 01:56.000
Otto: Mr. Ostroff's trust
is not gained easiIy.

01:56.040 --> 01:57.800
Two years it took me.

01:57.840 --> 02:00.400
You see, Micky,
he doesn't Iike new faces.

02:00.440 --> 02:03.760
So teII me, why am I
Iooking at a new face?

02:03.760 --> 02:05.680
Otto Krieg, meet my friend, Bobby.

02:05.720 --> 02:08.160
He's heIping me with the finance.

02:08.199 --> 02:10.120
He's not a cop.

02:32.880 --> 02:35.000
Let's see the money.

02:56.640 --> 03:00.280
( speaking Russian )

03:22.440 --> 03:24.800
You Iike it?

03:24.880 --> 03:26.440
Yeah, I Iike it.

03:26.480 --> 03:29.960
- We have deaI?
- We have deaI.

03:40.240 --> 03:42.560
( sirens bIaring )

03:42.600 --> 03:44.000
- Agent: Bring 'em down!
- Agent #2: Move!

03:44.040 --> 03:45.400
Agent #3: Move in!

03:49.960 --> 03:52.160
P.A.:
This is the FBI!

03:52.200 --> 03:53.960
Put your hands on your head!

03:56.080 --> 03:57.320
What is this?

03:57.360 --> 04:00.000
You brought a cop, and
he brought his fucking friends!

04:00.040 --> 04:01.960
- Don't Iook at me.
- This is not good.

04:02.000 --> 04:03.240
My father wiII kiII me!

04:03.280 --> 04:07.640
You're under arrest for the importation
and saIe of contraband firearms.

04:07.680 --> 04:08.640
Scheisse!

04:11.760 --> 04:14.240
- Agent #5: Gun!
- Agent #6: Drop the gun! Drop the gun!

04:16.200 --> 04:17.200
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

04:18.640 --> 04:20.079
Otto!

04:22.760 --> 04:25.840
This is not my deaI.
This is not my deaI!

04:25.880 --> 04:27.400
I don't even know these guys!

04:32.720 --> 04:34.000
Agent #7: Cease fire!

04:42.560 --> 04:46.400
HoIy shit. HoIy shit.

04:48.320 --> 04:49.960
Bobby!

04:51.760 --> 04:53.360
Bobby!

04:53.400 --> 04:56.000
Stay down!

05:07.200 --> 05:10.000
I'm caIIing it. It's 1 :37 AM.

05:10.040 --> 05:14.120
- Bag him and ship him.
- ( sirens sounding )

05:33.040 --> 05:35.240
God, I hate this job.

05:39.200 --> 05:41.360
- Give me a hand, feIIas.
- Yeah.

05:41.400 --> 05:44.040
AII right, Frank.
We gotta get you outta here.

05:44.080 --> 05:46.080
What the heII happened?
Who's the kid?

05:46.120 --> 05:48.560
DefiniteIy not in the pIan.
But we beat the spread.

05:48.600 --> 05:51.480
- This isn't footbaII.
- It's a figure of speech.

05:51.520 --> 05:53.960
PeopIe weren't supposed
to die out there.

05:55.800 --> 05:57.680
Get them IDed
and get them to the morgue.

05:57.720 --> 06:00.400
- And get me my pants!
- Can we get some pants over here?

06:02.480 --> 06:04.120
Ah, shit.

06:04.160 --> 06:05.640
AII: Surprise!

06:12.240 --> 06:15.240
To Frank CastIe...
the finest soIdier,

06:15.280 --> 06:17.240
the finest undercover op,

06:17.280 --> 06:18.760
the finest man I've ever known.

06:18.800 --> 06:20.480
What am I gonna do without you?

06:20.520 --> 06:24.040
- Get a girIfriend.
- ( aII Iaugh )

06:24.080 --> 06:27.440
Have fun in Puerto Rico, man.
Say heIIo to your foIks.

06:27.480 --> 06:28.880
Thanks.

06:31.480 --> 06:33.400
Agent Weeks.

06:34.960 --> 06:37.440
He's Robert Saint.
Howard Saint's son.

06:39.600 --> 06:41.760
More paperwork for Tampa PD.

06:41.800 --> 06:43.960
( chuckIes )
No, we can handIe this.

06:46.640 --> 06:48.680
- Weeks: See you, buddy!
- See you, feIIas!

07:27.840 --> 07:30.040
( woman gasps )

07:39.480 --> 07:42.720
BaiI him now.
Bring him to the cIub.

07:56.560 --> 07:58.440
Don't hit me. Don't hit me.

07:58.480 --> 08:00.680
- Hey, Micky.
- Don't hit me.

08:09.240 --> 08:10.800
( coughing )

08:10.840 --> 08:13.720
( grunting )

08:15.760 --> 08:18.960
You seII homegrown pot by the ounce,
Micky, not by the barreI.

08:19.000 --> 08:22.040
You seII badIy forged,
fake passports to Haitians.

08:22.080 --> 08:24.160
So what inspired you to become...

08:24.200 --> 08:26.840
the Mr. Universe
of internationaI arms deaIers?

08:28.760 --> 08:32.159
You shouId apoIogize for the death
of Mr. Saint's youngest chiId.

08:32.200 --> 08:34.240
Okay, I know how it Iooks...

08:34.280 --> 08:36.360
But Bobby, he buys pot from me.

08:36.400 --> 08:39.400
And when he found out what I was doing,
he insisted on coming in.

08:39.440 --> 08:42.600
He put up haIf the cash.
He came of his own free wiII.

08:45.040 --> 08:47.720
If you're gonna kiII me,
wiII you Ieave my face aIone,

08:47.760 --> 08:49.160
for my mother?

08:50.640 --> 08:53.040
We just made your baiI.

08:53.040 --> 08:56.200
If I wanted to kiII you, I wouId have
Ieft you in jaiI where we have friends,

08:56.240 --> 08:58.960
and in some way that I can onIy
describe as deepIy pornographic,

08:59.000 --> 09:01.440
you wouId have been kiIIed.
But you're a smaII piece of shit,

09:01.480 --> 09:04.800
and I don't want the karma
of your death on my souI.

09:07.080 --> 09:10.400
But on the other hand,
maybe I don't beIieve in karma,

09:10.480 --> 09:13.480
- so guys--
- No, I'II teII you what I want to know.

09:13.520 --> 09:16.680
I want to know one thing onIy,
who brokered the deaI?

09:16.720 --> 09:18.920
His name is Otto Krieg.

09:18.960 --> 09:22.360
And if it's any comfort
to Mr. Saint, he's dead too.

09:22.400 --> 09:26.560
WeII, it's not.
It's actuaIIy no comfort at aII.

09:26.600 --> 09:30.280
But what might be comforting to me,
is to watch the sIow death of the man

09:30.320 --> 09:32.200
who was supposed
to be taking care of my son,

09:32.240 --> 09:34.800
and making sure that
he did not get into troubIe.

09:34.840 --> 09:37.000
Now, Micky...

09:38.480 --> 09:40.760
what wouId your father
think of this?

09:40.800 --> 09:42.920
Your father gave his Iife for me.

09:42.960 --> 09:45.000
What wouId he say?

09:45.040 --> 09:47.240
I didn't know it was
gonna happen Iike this. PIease!

09:47.280 --> 09:50.720
WeII, ignorance is no excuse.

09:53.680 --> 09:57.520
The man who is responsibIe
for my son's death must die.

09:58.640 --> 10:00.400
( grunting )

10:00.440 --> 10:02.800
Saint: I toId you to never
Iet him out of your sight.

10:02.840 --> 10:05.680
Mr. Saint, Bobby toId me to stay.

10:05.720 --> 10:08.560
TeII him, John.
John!

10:11.200 --> 10:13.680
Thug: Mr. Saint!
It was Bobby's idea!

10:13.720 --> 10:16.480
He wanted to go aIone!
He thought he couId impress you.

10:16.520 --> 10:18.320
Thank you for that expIanation.

10:22.000 --> 10:25.200
My son didn't need to impress me.

10:39.600 --> 10:41.360
More boxes, guys.

11:03.640 --> 11:05.680
This was a hard one.

11:06.800 --> 11:09.160
This was the Iast one.

11:18.680 --> 11:20.360
( giggIes )

11:21.440 --> 11:24.200
( sighs )
It's over.

11:24.240 --> 11:27.600
TeII that to your son.
He doesn't beIieve me.

11:27.640 --> 11:31.240
- Where is he?
- You know.

11:37.360 --> 11:39.560
You know what I miss
most about Buck?

11:39.600 --> 11:41.640
He couId catch a baII,

11:41.680 --> 11:44.040
no matter how hard you threw it.

11:44.080 --> 11:46.600
He was right there.

11:46.640 --> 11:50.120
- Boy: Why are we aIways moving?
- This is the Iast time.

11:50.160 --> 11:52.880
You said that Iast time.

11:52.920 --> 11:55.880
I did?

11:55.920 --> 11:58.080
Yeah.

11:58.120 --> 12:00.480
You said we were Ieaving CaIifornia

12:00.560 --> 12:03.240
and we were gonna move to Virginia,

12:03.280 --> 12:05.480
and you'd work in Washington...

12:05.520 --> 12:08.080
and we'd never move again.

12:08.120 --> 12:12.080
( sighs )
I guess I've said a Iot of things, huh?

12:12.120 --> 12:14.480
So why London?

12:14.480 --> 12:17.320
London's a safe pIace
where we can aII be together.

12:17.360 --> 12:19.920
No more more moving around,
I promise.

12:22.200 --> 12:24.680
Some day when you're oIder, WiII...

12:26.320 --> 12:28.960
I'II teII you why we had
to move so much.

12:36.120 --> 12:38.840
He was such a speciaI boy.

12:38.880 --> 12:41.640
Are you identifying this body
as your son, Robert Saint?

12:41.680 --> 12:43.600
He deserved better.

12:44.560 --> 12:46.400
Somebody Iied to him.

12:46.440 --> 12:49.520
Promised him one thing,
gave him another.

12:51.440 --> 12:54.440
Do you know that I used to have
to dress him tiII he was 1 3?

12:54.480 --> 12:58.760
I'd tie his ties, and comb his hair...

12:58.800 --> 13:01.080
I'II have to get him a new suit.

13:07.360 --> 13:09.200
Who is Otto Krieg?

13:09.240 --> 13:11.720
Who are the peopIe
who work for him?

13:12.720 --> 13:14.600
Who are his friends?

13:14.640 --> 13:18.120
Who wouId stand to make money
from this deaI? TeII me.

13:18.160 --> 13:20.280
We can't taIk about the case, Mr. Saint.

13:20.320 --> 13:22.640
Now, I understand your grief,
but for your own safety,

13:22.640 --> 13:25.000
Ieave this to professionaIs.

13:25.040 --> 13:27.360
ProfessionaIs. Yes...

13:28.520 --> 13:30.560
I'II do that.

13:32.480 --> 13:34.400
( whispers )
I'II do that.

13:37.320 --> 13:39.360
Good bye, son.

13:44.880 --> 13:47.600
Man: We caIIed New York, we caIIed
Las Vegas, we caIIed Europe

13:47.640 --> 13:51.640
and Hong Kong, we even got
the SiciIians in it for oId time's sake.

13:51.680 --> 13:53.920
With what you're paying Howard,
we'II know everything

13:53.960 --> 13:56.800
about Otto Krieg within 24 hours.

14:05.880 --> 14:07.600
High five.

14:10.680 --> 14:12.560
- Come on.
- That was cooI!

14:12.600 --> 14:14.160
Leave it. We'II be back.

14:14.200 --> 14:15.960
- Race you?
- Yeah.

14:16.000 --> 14:17.640
Got anything Ieft?

14:17.680 --> 14:19.640
I don't see it!
Come on!

14:21.000 --> 14:23.440
He did his free ascent
on the first try.

14:23.480 --> 14:25.920
I've seen Navy SEALs do worse.

14:25.960 --> 14:28.880
- That's what we Iike to hear.
- I'm so proud of you.

14:28.920 --> 14:30.400
Good job, babe.

14:30.440 --> 14:33.640
Hey, Frank,
is that that CandeIaria?

14:33.680 --> 14:35.760
Frank:Yeah, ManueI.

14:35.800 --> 14:37.760
PeopIe around here
caII him a witch doctor.

14:37.800 --> 14:40.200
He Iives on that isIand
way off the point.

14:40.240 --> 14:43.880
OnIy one damn fooI I know
crazy enough to swim over there.

14:43.920 --> 14:45.840
- ( aII chuckIing )
- Gee, Iet me guess.

14:51.280 --> 14:53.880
- ( aII chatting )
- ( gIass cIinking )

14:55.760 --> 14:59.080
This is the first famiIy reunion
we've had in five years.

14:59.120 --> 15:01.400
And that's too Iong.
That's too Iong.

15:01.440 --> 15:02.680
- ( aII appIaud )
- Amen.

15:04.320 --> 15:07.120
Mr. CastIe: Two famiIies and
when you put them together,

15:07.160 --> 15:09.680
you get this: my grandson!

15:13.360 --> 15:15.320
I just want to say that...

15:15.360 --> 15:18.080
I'm very happy that you're aII here.

15:19.240 --> 15:22.440
I'm very proud that you're aII here.
And that...

15:22.480 --> 15:25.240
I Iove you.

15:25.280 --> 15:27.200
Love you, too, Dad.

15:27.240 --> 15:30.000
- SaIud!
- AII: SaIud!

15:55.240 --> 15:57.160
Hey!

15:57.200 --> 16:01.000
- Hey.
- What happened? What's wrong?

16:01.040 --> 16:03.240
You know...

16:04.840 --> 16:08.520
I can't beIieve I'm home...

16:12.280 --> 16:14.400
and that I couId ever be so Iucky.

16:16.080 --> 16:18.640
Because there were times,
Maria, I gotta teII you--

16:18.680 --> 16:21.520
Frank...

16:31.000 --> 16:33.960
I Iost so much time,
with both of you.

16:34.000 --> 16:36.600
- And I'm reaIIy sorry--
- Stop. Hey, hey, hey.

16:36.640 --> 16:39.880
I married you.
I knew what I was doing...

16:41.680 --> 16:43.560
and I'd do it again.

16:45.160 --> 16:48.200
You and I, we're not Iucky,

16:48.240 --> 16:51.040
we are bIessed.

16:55.440 --> 16:57.360
( beIIs ringing )

17:13.119 --> 17:14.560
I'II see you at home, son.

17:27.359 --> 17:29.880
His name's Frank CastIe.

17:29.920 --> 17:33.240
Senior agent.
Just got the Bureau's London desk.

17:33.280 --> 17:37.440
His aIias, connections,
apartments in Europe,

17:37.480 --> 17:39.240
none of it was reaI,

17:39.280 --> 17:40.920
not even his death.

17:40.960 --> 17:44.080
WeII, maybe it was.
Maybe...

17:44.120 --> 17:47.680
he died and came back to Iife
so he couId die again.

17:49.840 --> 17:51.560
You have your chance.

17:51.600 --> 17:53.560
He's Ieaving
for EngIand next week

17:53.600 --> 17:56.560
and he's at a famiIy reunion
in Puerto Rico.

17:58.440 --> 18:00.680
I think you shouId be there

18:00.720 --> 18:04.360
so you can come back
and teII Livia how he died.

18:04.400 --> 18:06.560
- AII right.
- Livia: Wait.

18:13.440 --> 18:15.640
His famiIy.

18:15.680 --> 18:19.440
His whoIe famiIy.

18:19.480 --> 18:22.200
Is this what you want?

18:46.720 --> 18:48.680
- Morning.
- Hey.

18:49.680 --> 18:52.040
Frank: We shouId have another.

18:52.080 --> 18:54.440
I'm ready.

18:56.400 --> 18:57.840
Another what?

18:57.840 --> 19:02.000
- Good morning, WiII.
- Come here.

19:05.360 --> 19:07.680
They were seIIing
T-shirts in town.

19:07.720 --> 19:09.680
One of them was reaIIy scary.

19:12.200 --> 19:15.320
The guy in the shop said
it wards off eviI spirits.

19:15.360 --> 19:17.160
It's reaIIy intense.

19:18.840 --> 19:20.920
- You know about this?
- Mm-hm.

19:24.080 --> 19:25.920
Let's see here...

19:29.320 --> 19:31.400
This is interesting.

19:31.440 --> 19:33.920
- Like it?
- Like it?

19:35.400 --> 19:36.920
I Iove it.

19:36.960 --> 19:39.240
Thanks.

19:45.680 --> 19:47.720
- ( chattering )
- ( music pIaying )

20:08.800 --> 20:10.640
Nice.

20:36.760 --> 20:38.920
Here you go.
Where's the camera? Okay.

20:38.960 --> 20:41.440
- Come on! You've gotta see this!
- What?

21:10.360 --> 21:13.320
Your 1911 CoIts,
you've done something to them.

21:18.040 --> 21:19.560
You couId say that.

21:19.600 --> 21:22.240
I bore the chambers
and customized the triggers

21:22.280 --> 21:25.680
and added some compensators.
They used to be pretty good,

21:25.720 --> 21:28.840
- but now they're naiI drivers.
- Let's see.

21:28.880 --> 21:31.160
Hey, Mom!

21:32.640 --> 21:34.840
- Look.
- Wow!

21:34.880 --> 21:37.480
- Look at that. It's a stingray.
- Yeah.

21:37.520 --> 21:39.760
- ( gun shot )
- ( screaming )

21:41.360 --> 21:42.720
( gasps )

21:42.760 --> 21:45.080
- Mom?
- ( whimpers )

21:45.120 --> 21:46.520
( screaming )

21:46.560 --> 21:47.960
Get down, WiIIie!
Get down!

21:50.120 --> 21:53.960
Get over here. Under the boat.
Get under it.

22:40.560 --> 22:44.680
( gasping )

23:11.840 --> 23:13.280
Jesus!

23:23.960 --> 23:27.280
Okay, I'm going to count to three,
and we're going to run to the jeep.

23:27.320 --> 23:29.520
- Okay, honey?
- What about Dad?

23:29.560 --> 23:30.680
Dad'II be okay.

23:43.440 --> 23:46.320
One... two... three...

23:47.520 --> 23:48.960
( grunts )

23:51.240 --> 23:52.640
Dad!

23:52.720 --> 23:54.640
- ( gunshots )
- Go on, honey.

23:55.680 --> 23:57.040
( whistIes )

24:20.320 --> 24:21.760
You hang on, honey!

24:52.400 --> 24:53.480
Mom!

25:04.560 --> 25:06.040
Are you okay?

25:08.600 --> 25:10.960
( machine gun firing )

25:23.120 --> 25:24.560
Mom's gonna get heIp, okay?

26:04.880 --> 26:07.400
( whimpering )

26:07.440 --> 26:11.480
Come on, baby.
Get out of the car.

26:11.520 --> 26:15.120
- Mom, my arm!
- Come on, honey, you can do it.

26:15.160 --> 26:18.000
- My arm! Mom, my arm.
- I know, baby.

26:18.040 --> 26:20.520
But we have to keep moving, okay?

26:20.560 --> 26:23.200
I need you to be a big boy,
and we have to keep moving, okay?

26:23.240 --> 26:24.640
- Okay.
- Okay.

26:24.720 --> 26:27.560
( Maria screams )
HeIp!

26:29.520 --> 26:31.440
( screaming )
HeIp!

26:31.440 --> 26:33.880
Somebody heIp me!

26:37.200 --> 26:39.240
Come on, baby!

26:39.280 --> 26:42.880
Mom, here.
Grandpa's boat.

26:42.920 --> 26:43.920
( engine roars )

26:51.280 --> 26:53.240
Run, honey!

27:15.600 --> 27:16.680
No...

27:17.840 --> 27:19.240
Maria!

28:20.960 --> 28:23.320
( gun cIicks )

29:18.080 --> 29:20.960
John: My mother and father
send their regards.

29:26.040 --> 29:28.040
This time,
they're not bIanks.

29:30.000 --> 29:31.800
- Maria--
- ( gunshot )

31:02.760 --> 31:05.800
It's me, CastIe. CandeIaria.
I'II take care of you.

31:28.560 --> 31:31.120
Are you gonna make Iove
to that car, or park it?

31:31.160 --> 31:35.400
Get that junk out of here!
Thank you.

31:35.440 --> 31:36.760
Come on, feIIas.

31:44.360 --> 31:46.840
Big crowd tonight, Mr. Saint.

31:46.880 --> 31:49.600
- You Iook beautifuI, Mrs. Saint.
- LittIe prick.

31:54.000 --> 31:55.240
HoIy shit!

31:55.280 --> 31:57.680
( saIsa music pIaying )

32:06.040 --> 32:09.280
- To Bobby.
- To Bobby.

32:09.320 --> 32:11.680
To a score settIed.

32:23.400 --> 32:25.520
Quentin, go dance with Livia.

32:25.560 --> 32:28.440
^^ AII these feeIings ^^

32:28.480 --> 32:30.760
^^ From my intuition... ^^

32:32.160 --> 32:33.800
When did you speak to him?

32:33.840 --> 32:36.040
Man: About an hour ago,
Mr. Saint.

32:37.320 --> 32:39.960
( singing continues )

32:45.520 --> 32:47.440
Try the Grand Turk.

33:10.000 --> 33:11.840
I got something for you.

33:19.000 --> 33:20.680
Harry Winston.

33:26.200 --> 33:27.880
BeautifuI.

33:27.920 --> 33:30.520
Without you,
they're just diamonds.

33:32.600 --> 33:35.720
I asked you to avenge our son
and you did.

35:47.680 --> 35:49.360
Thank you.

35:53.000 --> 35:54.600
Vaya con Dios, CastIe.

35:56.000 --> 35:57.640
Go with God.

35:57.680 --> 36:00.880
God's going to sit
this one out.

37:45.080 --> 37:49.160
^^ La donna è mobiIe
quaI piuma aI vento! ^^

37:49.200 --> 37:52.720
You are insignificant.

37:52.760 --> 37:55.760
You are a coward.

37:55.800 --> 37:59.840
You are a great disappointment
to your mother and I!

38:03.440 --> 38:06.520
Yes! Die!
Die! Die!

38:06.560 --> 38:10.200
I'm the most amazing man
in the worId!

38:12.160 --> 38:15.400
( engines roars )

38:22.960 --> 38:25.000
( roaring continues )

38:29.240 --> 38:30.680
It's reaIIy Ioud.

38:30.720 --> 38:32.160
Is it supposed
to be that Ioud?

38:32.200 --> 38:34.600
Oh, it's beautifuI.

38:34.640 --> 38:36.640
He hasn't sIept aII week.

38:36.680 --> 38:39.680
- How do you know?
- 'Cause I haven't sIept aII week.

38:39.720 --> 38:41.800
What do you think he does?

38:41.840 --> 38:44.640
Maybe he's an artist.

38:44.680 --> 38:46.800
Wow! Our neighbor
is an artist.

38:46.840 --> 38:49.480
You are the expert on artistes?

38:49.520 --> 38:51.120
I've known a few.

38:51.160 --> 38:53.320
So what do you think he's doing?

38:53.360 --> 38:55.440
Ask him.

38:55.480 --> 38:58.160
Oh, yeah, right.

38:58.200 --> 38:59.200
''Ask him.''

38:59.240 --> 39:01.000
I'm Iate for work.

39:02.000 --> 39:03.680
- Bye, Joan.
- Bye, Joan.

39:03.720 --> 39:04.800
Joan: Bye.

39:33.720 --> 39:35.800
This is undignified.

39:39.040 --> 39:40.440
You're supposed to be dead.

39:45.680 --> 39:48.440
Let's taIk.

39:48.480 --> 39:51.160
Stay away from me, CastIe.
I have friends, you know?

39:51.200 --> 39:53.280
Let's taIk about your friends.

39:53.320 --> 39:56.160
Make you own friends, buddy.
I'm not saying nothing.

39:56.240 --> 39:59.840
I taIk to you, they'II kiII me.
( gasps )

39:59.880 --> 40:02.720
You don't heIp me,
I'II kiII you now, Mick.

40:05.400 --> 40:07.560
The Saints teII me nothing.

40:09.040 --> 40:10.640
Nothing?

40:15.000 --> 40:16.360
They pay your rent...

40:18.680 --> 40:20.000
your IegaI biIIs...

40:22.920 --> 40:24.200
You shouId know something.

40:29.360 --> 40:30.920
What's the torch for?

40:32.080 --> 40:34.000
2,000 degrees, Mick.

40:34.040 --> 40:36.320
Enough to turn steeI
into butter.

40:40.320 --> 40:42.280
( sighs )

40:42.320 --> 40:46.040
It won't hurt at first.
It's too hot, you see?

40:46.080 --> 40:49.640
The fIame sears
the nerve endings shut,

40:49.680 --> 40:51.040
kiIIing them.

40:51.080 --> 40:53.160
You'II go into shock...

40:53.200 --> 40:56.200
and aII you'II feeI is...

40:56.240 --> 40:57.160
coId.

41:00.880 --> 41:02.320
Isn't science fun, Micky?

41:06.800 --> 41:08.680
I don't know shit.

41:10.000 --> 41:12.720
You'II smeII burning meat,
and then--

41:12.760 --> 41:14.760
then it'II hurt.

41:14.800 --> 41:16.640
I swear I'm teIIing
the truth!

41:20.760 --> 41:23.040
( screams )

41:23.080 --> 41:24.920
Son of a bitch!

41:26.560 --> 41:28.760
( screaming )

41:28.800 --> 41:31.040
Oh, my God.

41:31.080 --> 41:33.040
ShouId we caII the poIice?

41:33.080 --> 41:37.160
Let's stay out of it.
He's a very scary man.

41:37.200 --> 41:39.760
He's kiIIing someone
and we're next.

41:39.800 --> 41:41.480
ExactIy.

41:41.520 --> 41:44.680
- Wait, wait!
- ( screaming continues )

41:47.640 --> 41:50.280
SmeII that, Mick?
I'm burning off some of your fat.

41:56.720 --> 41:59.800
I'II teII you anything, anything,
anything you want to know.

41:59.840 --> 42:02.320
- That's a good boy.
- Okay, okay.

42:02.360 --> 42:05.960
Any discussion of Howard Saint's
business invoIves two Cubans--

42:06.000 --> 42:07.440
the Toro brothers.

42:07.440 --> 42:11.760
They controI aII the prostitution and
gambIing up and down the GuIf Coast--

42:11.800 --> 42:13.160
tons of cash.

42:13.200 --> 42:15.360
They give their dirty money
to Howard Saint,

42:15.400 --> 42:19.400
who transports it in cigarette boats
to his banks in Gran Cayman,

42:19.440 --> 42:22.200
washes it and wires it back
cIean as a whistIe.

42:28.560 --> 42:29.880
For the Iove of God!

42:48.040 --> 42:50.600
You are not a nice person.

42:50.640 --> 42:53.480
So what's up, you're gonna
string up Howard Saint

42:53.520 --> 42:55.240
and bIowtorch him?

42:55.280 --> 42:58.120
- I Iike that idea...
- ( camera shutter cIicks )

42:58.160 --> 43:00.360
but I have something better.

43:00.400 --> 43:01.920
Guess what?

43:02.000 --> 43:03.960
You're gonna heIp me.

43:04.000 --> 43:07.080
UnIess you want to stay Howard Saint's
Iackey for the rest of you Iife.

43:07.120 --> 43:09.760
I hate the Saints.
AII of them.

43:09.800 --> 43:10.960
TeII me about them.

43:11.000 --> 43:12.560
What they do, where.

43:12.600 --> 43:13.880
When.

43:13.920 --> 43:16.520
Howard Saint's a man
of strict habits.

43:16.560 --> 43:20.440
He has first tee time
five days a week at Tampa Springs.

43:20.480 --> 43:22.560
Never faiIs.

43:22.600 --> 43:25.240
He Iikes money,
he Iikes power,

43:25.280 --> 43:27.160
but the thing
this guy covets most,

43:27.200 --> 43:29.760
the wife, Livia.

43:29.800 --> 43:31.520
What happened
to your famiIy...

43:31.560 --> 43:33.440
Howard did that for her.

43:33.480 --> 43:36.520
She's just Iike him, and
she's just as predictabIe.

43:36.560 --> 43:38.560
Every Thursday,
she works out,

43:38.600 --> 43:40.880
gets her naiIs done
and goes to the movies.

43:40.920 --> 43:43.480
Howard knows every move
this broad makes.

43:43.520 --> 43:46.600
Any man who Iooks at her wrong,
he ends up in Tampa Bay.

43:52.720 --> 43:54.880
Let's not forget Johnny boy,

43:54.920 --> 43:56.640
the son you didn't kiII.

43:56.680 --> 43:58.560
What a putz.

43:58.600 --> 44:00.680
Last but no Ieast,

44:00.720 --> 44:02.040
Quentin GIass.

44:02.080 --> 44:04.240
Been with Howard 20 years--

44:04.280 --> 44:08.920
the famiIy consigIiore, Iawyer,
CPA and a sadist.

44:08.960 --> 44:11.160
Who knows
what's going on with this guy?

44:25.120 --> 44:27.160
( engine roars )

44:39.280 --> 44:41.840
- ( ceII phone rings )
- Yes?

44:41.880 --> 44:44.400
John: Pop, you are not
going to beIieve this.

44:46.680 --> 44:48.680
No, I think I might.

44:51.520 --> 44:54.280
Reporter: Chief Morris, wiII the budget
cuts mean Iess officers on the street?

44:54.320 --> 44:55.840
Thank you.
Thank you.

44:55.920 --> 44:58.520
What impact wiII aII this have
on poIice Iayoffs?

44:59.760 --> 45:01.920
- Chief: CastIe?
- Frank CastIe?

45:01.960 --> 45:05.520
- Hey, I thought you were dead.
- Wait, hoId them.

45:10.320 --> 45:11.800
Where have you been?

45:11.840 --> 45:15.040
It's been five months
since my famiIy was kiIIed,

45:15.080 --> 45:17.080
and I don't see
one man in jaiI.

45:17.120 --> 45:19.880
ObviousIy you're upset.

45:19.920 --> 45:22.440
Upset?
Is that the word?

45:24.880 --> 45:27.400
I used to get upset
when I had a fIat tire.

45:27.440 --> 45:30.160
I used to get upset
when a pIane was deIayed.

45:30.200 --> 45:33.400
I used to get upset when
the Yankees won the series.

45:35.400 --> 45:37.240
So if that's what ''upset'' means,

45:37.280 --> 45:39.960
then how do I feeI now?

45:40.000 --> 45:42.720
If you know the word,
teII me, because...

45:42.760 --> 45:44.120
I don't.

45:46.200 --> 45:48.680
( reporters cIamoring )

45:56.240 --> 45:58.240
Taxi!

46:24.200 --> 46:25.480
Enrique, ¿ qué pasó?

47:04.040 --> 47:04.960
Get up.

47:05.040 --> 47:06.840
WheeI the money out.

47:16.880 --> 47:17.840
FiII that up.

47:23.000 --> 47:25.000
You know
whose money this is?

47:27.000 --> 47:28.600
You know
whose buiIding this is?

47:28.640 --> 47:29.920
Howard Saint's.

47:29.960 --> 47:32.520
He's going to fuck your Iife up.

47:32.560 --> 47:35.240
He aIready fucked
my Iife up.

47:37.000 --> 47:38.640
Now, out the window.

47:39.800 --> 47:40.800
What?

47:44.120 --> 47:46.000
Out the window.

47:55.040 --> 47:57.640
( yeIIing, screaming )

48:14.080 --> 48:15.720
( tires screech, car crashes )

48:27.440 --> 48:29.200
Good business, murder?

48:29.240 --> 48:31.760
Did Saint pay for each one,

48:31.800 --> 48:34.520
or does he get
a group-rate discount?

49:42.840 --> 49:44.640
Reporter:
Our top story this morning,

49:44.680 --> 49:46.680
a doubIe homicide

49:46.720 --> 49:50.000
Two men were gunned down
in the Iobby of the Saint buiIding...

49:50.040 --> 49:53.200
Reporter #2: Frank CastIe
is aIive and back in Tampa.

49:53.240 --> 49:55.680
You may remember,
CastIe's the FBI agent

49:55.760 --> 49:57.240
presumed dead...

49:57.280 --> 49:58.680
He speaks six Ianguages,

49:58.720 --> 50:02.080
he did two tours
and 1 2 speciaI Ops CTU.

50:02.120 --> 50:05.240
- What's CTU?
- Counter Terrorism Unit.

50:05.280 --> 50:08.120
At this hour, Tampa poIice
do not have a motive

50:08.160 --> 50:11.240
and no arrests have been made.
That's the Iatest news at this hour...

50:11.280 --> 50:13.320
- ( door opens )
- It's him.

50:31.600 --> 50:32.720
Hi, there.

50:50.800 --> 50:52.800
Mr. CastIe's voice:
I just want to say

50:52.840 --> 50:56.360
that I'm very happy that you're aII
here, very proud that you're aII here.

50:58.000 --> 51:00.560
Frank's voice: I guess
I've said a Iot of things.

51:00.600 --> 51:03.800
Maria's voice: We're not Iucky,
we are bIessed.

51:04.760 --> 51:06.720
Maria!

51:14.640 --> 51:16.840
How is he stiII aIive?
I don't know, Quentin.

51:16.880 --> 51:18.280
I wasn't there.

51:18.320 --> 51:21.400
Why is he stiII aIive?
That's an interesting question.

51:21.440 --> 51:24.400
Maybe he's stiII aIive
because he was meant to suffer more.

51:24.440 --> 51:26.160
I don't know.

51:26.200 --> 51:28.880
But how can we make him suffer
if we can't find him?

51:31.640 --> 51:33.600
He's daring us.

51:33.640 --> 51:35.800
No, no, he misses his famiIy

51:35.840 --> 51:37.360
and he wants to die.

51:37.400 --> 51:39.760
He's asking for heIp,
so Iet's heIp him.

51:45.200 --> 51:46.280
Did the Toros caII?

51:46.320 --> 51:48.840
They'II be here
tomorrow morning.

51:51.240 --> 51:53.080
You invited them
to this house?

51:53.120 --> 51:55.600
They invited themseIves, Howard.

51:57.720 --> 51:59.400
Mike, Joe.

51:59.440 --> 52:00.520
WeIcome.

52:00.560 --> 52:02.320
Let's get a drink.

52:02.360 --> 52:03.920
We don't have time
for that, Howard.

52:03.960 --> 52:05.800
Oh my God,
this weather.

52:05.840 --> 52:07.680
Yeah, just a IittIe poIIuted,
don't you think so?

52:07.720 --> 52:09.320
I've seen hurricanes.

52:09.360 --> 52:11.720
I've seen it rain
Iike cats and dogs.

52:11.760 --> 52:15.240
But never in aII my years have I
seen it rain hundred-doIIar biIIs.

52:15.280 --> 52:17.160
Yeah, this rainmaker, CastIe,

52:17.200 --> 52:19.160
he was supposed
to be dead, no?

52:19.200 --> 52:20.680
- Yeah.
- Guys, Iook...

52:20.720 --> 52:23.560
come on...

52:23.600 --> 52:25.480
been working together
for 10 years.

52:25.520 --> 52:27.520
First time anything
Iike this ever happened.

52:27.560 --> 52:31.480
At a personaI Ioss to us
of $50 miIIion, Howard.

52:31.520 --> 52:33.280
That's one time too many.

52:33.320 --> 52:35.080
Do you want us
to find another banker?

52:36.400 --> 52:37.400
No.

52:38.360 --> 52:39.680
Okay.

52:39.720 --> 52:42.720
Look, we want our money back,
aII right?

52:42.760 --> 52:45.040
And we want protection
on the next shipment.

52:45.080 --> 52:46.920
Do you guarantee
our money this time?

52:46.960 --> 52:49.240
With everything I've got.

52:57.680 --> 52:59.200
In 48 hours,
CastIe is a memory.

52:59.240 --> 53:01.360
A pro from Memphis.
The best.

53:06.160 --> 53:07.760
Man:
Come on, Joannie.

53:07.800 --> 53:10.760
Open up the goddamn door,
you fucking bitch!

53:14.400 --> 53:17.240
I want to taIk with you now
Honey, you're hurting my feeIings.

53:19.000 --> 53:21.080
Joannie, open up
the goddamn door!

53:21.120 --> 53:23.560
You're hurting my feeIings,
you bitch!

53:23.600 --> 53:25.400
Hmm, dude?

53:26.680 --> 53:29.120
It's kind of Iate.

53:29.200 --> 53:31.720
Yeah? What time
is it in Hawaii?

53:31.760 --> 53:33.360
You shouId Ieave
right now.

53:33.400 --> 53:35.680
Shut your face,
you Iard ass.

53:37.400 --> 53:40.000
Joannie, come on,
baby, Iet me in.

53:40.040 --> 53:41.240
I'm gonna caII the cops.

53:50.800 --> 53:52.520
Are you?

53:52.520 --> 53:55.440
You'II caII the cops?
You'II caII the cops?

53:55.480 --> 53:57.440
CaII them! CaII them!
CaII them!

53:57.520 --> 53:59.560
CaII them! CaII them!
CaII them!

53:59.600 --> 54:01.000
Hey!

54:02.040 --> 54:03.400
Get out.

54:03.440 --> 54:04.960
( sighs )

54:05.000 --> 54:06.880
What, what, what?

54:06.920 --> 54:10.440
He don't have his tricks anymore?

54:10.480 --> 54:13.160
And the speed?
Huh?

54:13.200 --> 54:15.160
What, what, what--

54:21.160 --> 54:22.760
You shouIdn't pIay
with knives.

54:22.800 --> 54:24.600
( man grunts )

54:24.640 --> 54:27.080
( footsteps, groaning )

54:33.480 --> 54:37.360
No one's ever
stood up for me before.

54:46.360 --> 54:48.320
Come on , champ.
Let's get some ice on that.

54:48.360 --> 54:49.880
Come on.

54:49.920 --> 54:51.800
Frank kicked his ass, huh?

54:51.840 --> 54:55.080
He's fine, he's aII right.

54:58.680 --> 55:00.480
I--

55:02.040 --> 55:06.160
I've Iived in seven cities
in seven years and...

55:06.200 --> 55:08.160
in each one,
I've managed to find

55:08.240 --> 55:11.160
the one guy
who wiII treat me the worst.

55:11.200 --> 55:13.760
But I'm trying to fix that.

55:15.400 --> 55:16.920
You're CastIe.

55:18.800 --> 55:21.160
Used to be.

55:21.200 --> 55:22.800
We saw you on TV.

55:22.840 --> 55:24.840
I don't have one.

55:26.520 --> 55:30.440
I'm Joan.
Dave's the one with aII the--

55:30.480 --> 55:31.920
the metaI.

55:31.960 --> 55:33.760
And Bumpo's is the--

55:33.800 --> 55:37.640
weII, you can probabIy figure out
which one Bumpo is.

55:40.360 --> 55:41.800
We are reaIIy sorry.

55:43.520 --> 55:44.720
About what?

55:44.760 --> 55:46.800
About your famiIy.

55:49.560 --> 55:50.960
Did you know them?

55:52.200 --> 55:53.720
No.

55:56.280 --> 55:57.680
I'm over it.

56:09.200 --> 56:11.520
Joan:
Don't Iet your memories kiII you.

56:17.200 --> 56:19.080
They won't kiII me.

56:53.040 --> 56:56.000
- ( beeping )
- ( engine starts )

57:20.080 --> 57:21.680
( phone rings )

57:26.160 --> 57:28.520
- GIass.
- Quentin GIass?

57:28.520 --> 57:29.680
Who is this?

57:29.720 --> 57:32.120
Distorted voice: I have
certain photographic studies

57:32.160 --> 57:33.680
of you and your boyfriend.

57:33.720 --> 57:35.560
Meet me at the bar,
at the Wyndham HoteI.

57:35.560 --> 57:38.280
Bring $5,000, and
I'II give you the photos.

57:38.320 --> 57:42.240
You wouIdn't want Howard Saint
to see them, Mr. GIass.

58:43.960 --> 58:45.800
Thank you, sir.
Have a good night.

58:52.240 --> 58:54.160
Quentin is Iate.
Do you know were he is?

58:54.200 --> 58:57.320
- I have no idea.
- Have you seen your mother?

58:57.360 --> 58:59.160
It's Thursday, Pop.

59:00.720 --> 59:02.440
Right. Movies.

59:02.480 --> 59:04.360
Mr. Saint?

59:04.400 --> 59:06.040
I know where Mr. GIass is.

59:06.080 --> 59:09.320
I saw him puIIing into
the Wyndham HoteI a coupIe of hours ago.

59:13.440 --> 59:15.400
( both Iaughing )

59:22.000 --> 59:23.880
Howard?
Come here.

59:23.880 --> 59:26.440
I was just teIIing Quentin
about the movie.

59:26.480 --> 59:28.160
Where have you been,
Quentin?

59:28.200 --> 59:30.200
I've been Iooking for you.

59:30.240 --> 59:32.480
I dozed off
out by the pooI.

59:32.520 --> 59:34.920
- That's funny.
- What's funny?

59:34.960 --> 59:37.000
Micky said that he saw you
at the Wyndham.

59:37.040 --> 59:38.920
Micky shouId have
his eyes checked.

59:38.960 --> 59:40.600
So he's mistaken?

59:40.640 --> 59:43.240
Yes, Howard,
he's mistaken.

59:50.720 --> 59:51.880
Oh, my goodness.

59:51.920 --> 59:53.960
These pancakes
are reaIIy good, Joan.

59:57.600 --> 59:59.880
What's he been doing
for the Iast few days?

01:00:00.960 --> 01:00:02.600
Drinking.

01:00:02.600 --> 01:00:03.800
A Iot.

01:00:03.840 --> 01:00:06.000
( beIIs rings )

01:00:11.440 --> 01:00:13.720
Good morning, sir.
Sit anywhere you Iike.

01:01:03.080 --> 01:01:05.760
^^ I can hear
what you're thinking ^^

01:01:07.640 --> 01:01:09.800
^^ AII your doubts

01:01:11.760 --> 01:01:14.240
^^ And if you

01:01:14.280 --> 01:01:17.960
^^ In time, you'II find
the reason I'm here ^^

01:01:19.680 --> 01:01:23.800
^^And in time, aII things

01:01:23.840 --> 01:01:28.240
^^ In time, you may

01:01:29.680 --> 01:01:32.200
^^ To Iive once more ^^

01:01:33.560 --> 01:01:35.560

01:01:38.560 --> 01:01:44.200
^^ But in time, your time
wiII be no more. ^^

01:02:04.960 --> 01:02:06.160
Do I know you?

01:02:06.200 --> 01:02:07.720
I know you.

01:02:07.760 --> 01:02:10.560
You're that boy
in the newspaper,

01:02:10.600 --> 01:02:12.480
came back from the dead.

01:02:12.560 --> 01:02:14.360
I didn't catch your name.

01:02:22.600 --> 01:02:23.720
You Iike that song?

01:02:24.840 --> 01:02:26.360
I wrote that for you.

01:02:33.800 --> 01:02:35.880
I'm gonna sing it
at your funeraI.

01:04:06.160 --> 01:04:09.160
You are one dumb
son of a bitch.

01:04:09.200 --> 01:04:10.920
Bring a knife
to a gunfight.

01:04:32.560 --> 01:04:34.280
Más rápido, más rápido!
Come on, Iet's move.

01:04:35.400 --> 01:04:36.480
Let's move!

01:04:54.520 --> 01:04:56.360
( faint beeping )

01:05:33.280 --> 01:05:35.920
( screams )
AII of it? AII?

01:05:36.920 --> 01:05:38.200
Look at this, Joe.

01:05:38.240 --> 01:05:40.600
- This is what I'm taIking about.
- Don't touch me, cojones.

01:05:44.560 --> 01:05:46.240
Don't teII the Toros,
tiII we have a pIan.

01:05:46.280 --> 01:05:49.000
Look at this pIace.
Isn't it beautifuI?

01:05:49.040 --> 01:05:51.760
Howard, we had chicken
a Ia Havana tonight.

01:05:51.800 --> 01:05:54.440
Very tasty.

01:05:54.440 --> 01:05:56.240
Don't touch the Cubans.

01:06:02.480 --> 01:06:03.880
Have you heard the news?

01:06:03.880 --> 01:06:06.840
A shipment of cash
was torched at MaIaqui.

01:06:06.880 --> 01:06:08.600
Whose money was it, huh?

01:06:08.640 --> 01:06:12.680
Our mother aIways put
her cash in the mattress,

01:06:12.680 --> 01:06:14.360
which I thought
it was a good idea

01:06:14.400 --> 01:06:15.840
tiII the house burned down.

01:06:15.880 --> 01:06:18.360
It was a big fire.

01:06:18.400 --> 01:06:19.720
She Iost everything.

01:06:21.640 --> 01:06:22.920
That's what happens

01:06:22.960 --> 01:06:24.640
when you don't watch
your money.

01:06:24.680 --> 01:06:27.960
You Iose everything, Howard.
Everything.

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:29.920
14 shipments are perfect.

01:06:29.960 --> 01:06:32.600
One went bad
and I get this, why?

01:06:32.640 --> 01:06:34.560
Because you want to scare me?

01:06:34.600 --> 01:06:37.240
There's no insurance
in this business. You know that.

01:06:37.280 --> 01:06:39.400
So I'm not covering
you fucking Iosses.

01:06:39.400 --> 01:06:42.880
And Mike, if you don't Iike it,
just remember one thing:

01:06:42.920 --> 01:06:45.000
I've got more guns
than you do.

01:06:48.040 --> 01:06:49.880
It's not even Cuban,
Howard.

01:06:49.920 --> 01:06:52.080
It's Honduran.

01:06:57.280 --> 01:06:58.480
They're animaIs.

01:06:58.520 --> 01:07:02.040
With aII due respect,
we don't have more guns.

01:07:02.080 --> 01:07:05.520
- It's my duty to--
- It's your duty to make CastIe dead!

01:07:05.560 --> 01:07:08.040
I don't care what it takes,
what it costs.

01:07:08.080 --> 01:07:09.800
CaII the Russian.

01:07:15.040 --> 01:07:16.800
( knock on door )

01:07:31.200 --> 01:07:32.840
Hi.

01:07:34.240 --> 01:07:36.760
Mr. CastIe,
we need you heIp right now,

01:07:36.800 --> 01:07:39.160
because the guy
who's after Joan

01:07:39.200 --> 01:07:41.200
is in her apartment...
right now.

01:08:03.680 --> 01:08:06.520
We want you
to have dinner with us.

01:08:33.200 --> 01:08:35.000
I know it's not Thanksgiving,

01:08:35.040 --> 01:08:36.479
but um...

01:08:36.520 --> 01:08:39.800
I'd Iike us to aII say
what we're thankfuI for.

01:08:42.160 --> 01:08:43.560
I'II start.

01:08:46.520 --> 01:08:49.160
I'm thankfuI
to be aIive this year.

01:08:51.240 --> 01:08:53.160
And to have a job.

01:08:55.200 --> 01:08:56.760
And to be sober.

01:08:58.840 --> 01:09:02.319
Yeah, I'm thankfuI
for my mom...

01:09:02.359 --> 01:09:03.680
getting out of jaiI.

01:09:03.720 --> 01:09:06.960
You know, it's cooI.

01:09:08.720 --> 01:09:11.800
And this girI
gave me her number...

01:09:11.840 --> 01:09:13.560
which is aIso cooI.

01:09:16.359 --> 01:09:18.479
Thanks for Ieftovers.
I'm fuII.

01:09:18.520 --> 01:09:21.040
Thanks for Diet Pepsi.

01:09:21.080 --> 01:09:22.760
And thanks for good neighbors.

01:09:34.359 --> 01:09:36.200
Thanks for dinner.

01:09:39.479 --> 01:09:40.920
There's dessert.

He's not.

01:17:12.040 --> 01:17:14.720
- We have to get him to a hospitaI.
- He needs a doctor.

01:17:14.760 --> 01:17:16.920
- You need a doctor.

I asked you a question, fat man.

01:20:09.320 --> 01:20:10.640
Leave him aIone.

Hmm?

I'm having a difficuIt time

I'm not saying shit.

01:20:39.640 --> 01:20:41.840
I don't want you to say shit,
I want you to answer me.

01:20:43.920 --> 01:20:46.720
You don't want to say anything
about anything you might know?

01:21:10.720 --> 01:21:11.800
( grunts )

01:21:23.920 --> 01:21:26.600
Maybe we shouId get to know
each other a IittIe better.

01:21:26.640 --> 01:21:28.160
What's your name?

01:21:30.080 --> 01:21:31.120
Dave.

01:21:31.160 --> 01:21:32.880
You go to schooI around here?

01:21:34.120 --> 01:21:37.560
- You don't go to schooI?
- No.

01:21:38.520 --> 01:21:39.880
No, I dropped out.

01:21:39.920 --> 01:21:41.680
You dropped out?

01:21:42.960 --> 01:21:45.440
You're not doing drugs,
are you?

01:21:45.480 --> 01:21:47.240
Not right now.

01:21:48.320 --> 01:21:50.280
And what are you doing

01:21:50.320 --> 01:21:51.840
What is it?

01:21:51.880 --> 01:21:52.880
Piercings.

01:21:52.920 --> 01:21:55.360
Piercings?

01:21:55.400 --> 01:21:56.760
Did it hurt
when you did that?

01:21:57.840 --> 01:21:58.960
Not reaIIy.

01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:00.920
You Iike that?

01:22:00.960 --> 01:22:02.680
Did it hurt a IittIe bit?

01:22:07.280 --> 01:22:09.120
That's a speciaI one there,
isn't it?

01:22:09.160 --> 01:22:10.520
Is that your favorite?

01:22:10.560 --> 01:22:12.360
That's hard to get.

01:22:12.400 --> 01:22:13.600
Yeah.

- GIass: Come here.
- Dave: No.

01:22:57.320 --> 01:22:59.080
Your friend 's about
to have a bad day.

01:22:59.080 --> 01:23:00.560
You can save him by taIking.

01:23:07.440 --> 01:23:09.240
It doesn't have
to be this way.

01:23:11.880 --> 01:23:13.640
You think you know
about pain, boy?

01:23:13.640 --> 01:23:16.360
What do you know
about pain?

01:23:23.920 --> 01:23:26.280
That's okay.
That's okay.

Are you going to teII me?

01:23:33.360 --> 01:23:34.680
- No!
- Huh?

01:23:34.720 --> 01:23:38.640
Why don't you and I see if we can
discover the true nature of pain?

01:23:38.680 --> 01:23:39.680
Stop.

01:23:39.720 --> 01:23:41.160
Come here, Dave.

01:23:41.200 --> 01:23:43.200
Come on, come on.

01:23:43.240 --> 01:23:44.800

- TaIk to me, Dave.

01:23:59.880 --> 01:24:01.880
If they knew,
they wouId have taIked.

01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:05.600
They must not have known.

01:24:06.840 --> 01:24:08.000
If--

01:24:08.040 --> 01:24:10.280
when he shows up...

01:24:10.280 --> 01:24:12.200

01:24:44.200 --> 01:24:45.880
Bye, sweetie.

01:26:02.280 --> 01:26:04.320
Look what they did to him.

01:26:08.240 --> 01:26:10.680
They tried to make me taIk.

01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:14.120
I gave them nothing.

01:26:17.440 --> 01:26:19.320
You don't know me.

01:26:20.680 --> 01:26:23.960
You don't owe me anything.
I've brought you nothing but troubIe.

01:26:24.920 --> 01:26:26.640
Why are you ready
to die for me?

01:26:27.600 --> 01:26:29.960
Because, you're one of us.

01:26:32.160 --> 01:26:34.080
You're famiIy.

01:26:46.960 --> 01:26:48.840
Get him to a hospitaI.

01:26:50.760 --> 01:26:53.480
Come on, champ,

01:27:21.480 --> 01:27:23.400
Say you kiII them aII...

01:27:23.440 --> 01:27:24.760
then what?

01:27:24.800 --> 01:27:27.560
What makes you
any different from them?

01:27:30.600 --> 01:27:32.720
They have something to Iose.

01:27:39.760 --> 01:27:42.040
You're gonna die tonight,
aren't you?

01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:46.560
Is that what you want?

01:27:59.920 --> 01:28:02.680
Frank's voice: ''I Ieave this

01:28:12.280 --> 01:28:14.320
'Sic vis pacem para beIIum'--

01:28:14.360 --> 01:28:18.080

Distorted voice: Those pictures

01:28:57.960 --> 01:28:59.760
The number's now $10,000.

01:28:59.800 --> 01:29:02.240
Be at McNab's the men's store

how do you want me

01:29:44.360 --> 01:29:46.080
Pay for what?

01:29:46.120 --> 01:29:48.880
I was detaiIing Mrs. Saint's car
and I found this ticket.

01:29:48.920 --> 01:29:51.960
Just take care of it.
Where was it?

01:29:52.000 --> 01:29:54.360

01:29:57.080 --> 01:29:59.040

01:30:00.240 --> 01:30:02.640
Where did you say Quentin

01:30:02.680 --> 01:30:04.120
The Wyndham HoteI.

01:30:04.160 --> 01:30:07.920
But Mrs. Saint was at the movies
Iast Thursday, wasn't she?

01:30:08.880 --> 01:30:11.880
- Do you have Quentin's house keys?
- Sure.

01:30:11.920 --> 01:30:13.880
I do his Iaundry.

01:30:15.800 --> 01:30:17.480

01:32:04.800 --> 01:32:06.240
Excuse me?

01:32:06.280 --> 01:32:08.920
You know, Jim Bowie,
the coIoneI...

01:32:08.960 --> 01:32:11.480
the man who died
in The AIamo--

01:32:11.520 --> 01:32:14.320
had a knife named after him.
He was a gambIer.

01:32:14.360 --> 01:32:16.600
And when he was accused
of cheating at cards,

01:32:16.640 --> 01:32:20.000
what he wouId do is take
the guy in the other room,

01:32:20.040 --> 01:32:22.920
move the furniture
Iike so...

01:32:23.880 --> 01:32:26.400
then he'd take his knife,

01:32:26.440 --> 01:32:28.680
he'd throw it in the ground...

01:32:29.640 --> 01:32:31.960
and the one that Ieft...

01:32:32.000 --> 01:32:34.080
got the money.

01:32:34.120 --> 01:32:35.880
Gee, I didn't know that, Howard.

01:32:35.880 --> 01:32:39.360
The onIy probIem is that
you have too much furniture.

01:32:39.400 --> 01:32:41.200
I'm not foIIowing this.

01:32:41.240 --> 01:32:44.040
- I'm accusing you.
- Of what?

01:32:45.320 --> 01:32:46.720
Cheating.

01:32:47.680 --> 01:32:49.840
I've never taken
a cent from you.

01:32:52.640 --> 01:32:55.720
Where were the two of you going
to do it next time, the Wyndham?

01:32:55.760 --> 01:32:58.680
- Two who?
- You and the whore.

01:32:58.720 --> 01:33:00.880
I don't know
what you are taIking about.

01:33:01.920 --> 01:33:04.160
Oooh.
( Iaughs )

01:33:04.200 --> 01:33:06.360
You're good.

01:33:06.400 --> 01:33:08.240
You shouId have been
a stage actor.

01:33:08.280 --> 01:33:10.440
Maybe next Iifetime.

01:33:10.480 --> 01:33:12.760
What are you doing?

01:33:12.800 --> 01:33:14.600
You better pick up
the knife, Quentin.

01:33:14.640 --> 01:33:16.520
If you don't, I wiII.

01:33:16.520 --> 01:33:18.360
I don't need to grab
a knife, Howard.

01:33:20.560 --> 01:33:22.280
This isn't funny, Howard.

01:33:23.880 --> 01:33:25.640
Whoa!

01:33:25.680 --> 01:33:27.760
What?

01:33:27.800 --> 01:33:29.040
What?!

01:33:30.000 --> 01:33:31.880
How Iong have you
worked for me?

01:33:31.880 --> 01:33:33.280
You think I'm an idiot?

01:33:34.440 --> 01:33:37.640
Have you Iost your mind--
( grunts )

01:33:39.280 --> 01:33:41.160
You were my brother.

01:33:41.160 --> 01:33:43.440
I gave you everything, didn't I?

01:33:43.480 --> 01:33:44.840
But it wasn't enough.

01:33:44.880 --> 01:33:48.360
- My Liv.
- What has she toId you?

01:33:50.280 --> 01:33:52.840
Don't you see?
Don't--

01:33:52.880 --> 01:33:54.600
don't do this!

01:33:54.640 --> 01:33:57.320
Don't, don't, don't do this.

01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:02.000
Howard...
you're kiIIing me.

01:34:02.040 --> 01:34:04.280
You're kiIIing me.
Why?

01:34:04.320 --> 01:34:07.160
Why are you kiIIing me?
Why are you kiIIing me?

01:34:39.880 --> 01:34:42.360
What the heII
are you doing?

01:34:42.400 --> 01:34:44.120
I know about you
and Quentin.

01:34:44.160 --> 01:34:46.080
Quentin?

01:34:46.120 --> 01:34:49.000
You went to the movies
Iast Thursday, 8:00?

01:34:49.000 --> 01:34:50.200
Yes.

01:34:50.240 --> 01:34:52.800
Then at 9:00,
you caIIed him from your car?

01:34:52.840 --> 01:34:55.240
Must've been a short movie.

01:34:55.280 --> 01:34:57.160
Howard,
there's an expIanation.

01:34:57.160 --> 01:34:59.240
I know, I know.

01:34:59.280 --> 01:35:00.840
You're fucking him.

01:35:00.880 --> 01:35:03.880
You're fucking my best friend.

01:35:03.920 --> 01:35:06.600
That wouId be a IittIe hard
to accompIish, Howard.

01:35:06.640 --> 01:35:09.000
Oh, so true.

01:35:09.960 --> 01:35:12.160
So true.

01:35:15.320 --> 01:35:17.120
Howard.

01:35:17.160 --> 01:35:19.640
You shouId reaIIy Iearn
to pay your parking tickets.

01:35:22.840 --> 01:35:24.880
What--

01:35:24.920 --> 01:35:27.240
You thought we--

01:35:27.280 --> 01:35:28.720
Howard...

01:35:28.760 --> 01:35:30.280
Quentin was gay.

01:35:30.320 --> 01:35:32.800
You'd say anything!

01:35:35.000 --> 01:35:36.680
I don't know what happened.

01:35:36.720 --> 01:35:38.280
WouId you just taIk to me?!

01:35:39.360 --> 01:35:41.080
Howard, Howard.

01:35:58.760 --> 01:35:59.960
Howard.

01:36:01.120 --> 01:36:02.440
You have to Iisten to me.

01:36:02.480 --> 01:36:04.240
PIease, Howard.

01:36:04.280 --> 01:36:05.920
PIease, Howard.

01:36:05.960 --> 01:36:08.480
Do you recognize
the neighborhood?

01:36:08.520 --> 01:36:10.640
LittIe Cuba.

01:36:10.680 --> 01:36:13.480
Just think,

01:36:13.480 --> 01:36:16.360
the first time I saw you
was onIy three bIocks from here.

01:36:16.360 --> 01:36:17.920
Look at me, Howard.

01:36:17.960 --> 01:36:23.000
Of course then, the neighborhood
was much more coIorfuI.

01:36:23.040 --> 01:36:25.320
Look at me.
Howard, pIease.

01:36:25.360 --> 01:36:27.480
PIease, Howard.

01:36:27.520 --> 01:36:29.600
Now it's just for whores.
You'II fit right in.

01:36:44.240 --> 01:36:46.920
Look at that rock!
Look at it! Take a Iook!

01:36:46.960 --> 01:36:48.800
I gave you that
when I had nothing.

01:36:48.840 --> 01:36:50.680
AII I asked for
in return, was IoyaIty.

01:36:50.720 --> 01:36:53.600
I have been IoyaI to you, Howard.
You're not making any sense!

01:36:53.640 --> 01:36:56.160
I'm not making sense?
Here, Iook at this.

01:36:56.200 --> 01:37:00.000
I found that in Quentin's bed.
Does that make enough sense for you?

01:37:00.040 --> 01:37:01.640
Huh, huh?

01:37:01.680 --> 01:37:03.400
No.

01:37:30.760 --> 01:37:32.080
I'd Iike to go to the cIub.

01:37:32.120 --> 01:37:34.440
I need a Martini.

01:37:52.000 --> 01:37:54.440
$50,000 a piece.

01:37:54.480 --> 01:37:57.560
And $50,000 more
to the man who kiIIs him.

01:37:57.600 --> 01:38:01.760
If you accept this money,
you are in tiII it's over.

01:38:09.280 --> 01:38:11.160
Where have you been?

01:38:11.200 --> 01:38:12.800
Huh?

01:38:14.040 --> 01:38:16.720
- Where's Quentin?
- Oh... weII,

01:38:16.760 --> 01:38:18.600
he's wrapped up in something.

01:38:19.560 --> 01:38:22.360
- I caIIed home, no one was there.
- Your mother's gone.

01:38:24.160 --> 01:38:27.440

In order to shame
its inadequacy,
