WEBVTT

00:06.437 --> 00:07.778
Oh sure,

00:07.778 --> 00:09.340
just leave that old skin
anywhere.

00:09.340 --> 00:12.483
Dirty reptiles.

00:12.483 --> 00:15.146
Stan,
I'm bouncing off the walls.

00:15.146 --> 00:16.647
Tomorrow is the first day
of school,

00:16.647 --> 00:18.389
and I just want to
get there already.

00:18.389 --> 00:20.251
If only I could fast forward
through time.

00:20.251 --> 00:21.622
Do what dogs do to skip

00:21.622 --> 00:23.754
over the boring parts
of life: nap.

00:23.754 --> 00:26.257
That's what I was doing
while you were talking just now.

00:26.257 --> 00:29.160
All I heard was,
"Stan, I'm bouncing off the..."

00:29.160 --> 00:31.162
Fast forward through time.

00:31.162 --> 00:33.634
I'm too excited to nap.

00:33.634 --> 00:35.766
I'm gonna be
a high school freshman.

00:35.766 --> 00:37.468
No!

00:37.468 --> 00:39.140
It should be fresh-woman.

00:39.140 --> 00:40.241
No!
Fresh-person.

00:40.241 --> 00:42.042
Consider "fresh-mammal."

00:42.042 --> 00:43.544
It's more inclusive,

00:43.544 --> 00:47.618
while keeping out
those dirty reptiles.

00:47.618 --> 00:49.550
I'm pretty stoked that
I'm going to be a senior now.

00:49.550 --> 00:51.422
I get the senior discount
at the movies

00:51.422 --> 00:53.124
and the early bird special
at the diner.

00:54.585 --> 00:56.587
Tyler,
that's for senior citizens.

00:56.587 --> 00:58.789
Oh, that's why
there are so many old ladies

00:58.789 --> 01:01.562
at my swim aerobics class
at the senior center.

01:03.464 --> 01:05.266
Well, I'm still excited
about the senior prank

01:05.266 --> 01:07.338
I'm gonna pull on
the first day of school.

01:07.338 --> 01:09.370
Wait, aren't senior pranks
usually at the end of the year?

01:09.370 --> 01:10.541
But if you do it
at the end of the year,

01:10.541 --> 01:12.173
then you're gone.

01:12.173 --> 01:14.105
You don't get
to baste in the glory.

01:14.105 --> 01:15.746
You "bask" in the glory.

01:15.746 --> 01:18.078
You "baste"
in the juices of meat.

01:18.078 --> 01:20.211
And even if it weren't
a senior citizen center...

01:20.211 --> 01:21.212
really?

01:21.212 --> 01:22.383
Swim aerobics?

01:22.383 --> 01:24.155
It's low impact

01:24.155 --> 01:26.417
and it's very satisfying
being the best one.

01:26.417 --> 01:28.389
And about this basting thing,

01:28.389 --> 01:30.521
tell me more
about the meaty juices.

01:30.521 --> 01:33.664
Oh, and talk real slow.

01:34.825 --> 01:36.327
Check this out.

01:36.327 --> 01:38.229
I planned
the perfect prank.

01:38.229 --> 01:40.131
I'm gonna
run the groundskeeper's hose

01:40.131 --> 01:42.533
into the school commons
and get everything wet.

01:42.533 --> 01:45.236
Tyler, there's nothing the least
bit clever about that.

01:45.236 --> 01:46.437
Right,
like you could do better.

01:46.437 --> 01:47.578
Please.

01:47.578 --> 01:50.341
I could do so much better.

01:50.341 --> 01:51.442
But pranks
are against the rules,

01:51.442 --> 01:52.583
so you're on your own.

01:52.583 --> 01:54.315
Fine.

01:54.315 --> 01:57.318
All the puddles.
Classic.

01:57.318 --> 01:59.250
No.
No, it's not!

01:59.250 --> 02:00.891
If you just ran the hose--

02:00.891 --> 02:02.253
Rules exist for a reason.

02:02.253 --> 02:04.855
Everything will be wet!

02:04.855 --> 02:07.298
Rules are important
but so is doing things right!

02:10.361 --> 02:13.264
You just came up
with this lame prank on purpose

02:13.264 --> 02:15.506
knowing I wouldn't be able
to resist fixing it, didn't you?

02:15.506 --> 02:17.538
Yep, thought of it
at the senior center

02:17.538 --> 02:19.540
while I was playing pinochle
with Mildred and the girls.

02:21.272 --> 02:22.543
Told you that would work,
Stan.

02:23.744 --> 02:24.875
Stan?

02:24.875 --> 02:26.417
Stan, are you in there--

02:26.417 --> 02:28.279
STAN:
Basting in meaty juices?

02:28.279 --> 02:30.251
Maybe.

02:31.822 --> 02:33.584
STAN:
As I was basting,

02:33.584 --> 02:35.386
I got to thinking
about pranks,

02:35.386 --> 02:37.388
and decided
to try one on Robert.

02:37.388 --> 02:40.291
He thought he was reaching
for a banana.

02:40.291 --> 02:43.434
( Stan laughing )

02:43.434 --> 02:46.166
Oh, Robert,
the look on your face.

02:46.166 --> 02:47.298
It's priceless!

02:47.298 --> 02:49.169
( Stan laughing )

03:08.219 --> 03:09.560
Can you believe it?

03:09.560 --> 03:11.422
We're finally in high school.

03:11.422 --> 03:12.863
I know
it's the same commons

03:12.863 --> 03:14.194
for high school
and middle school,

03:14.194 --> 03:15.966
but it feels so different.

03:17.197 --> 03:18.769
Nothing's different.

03:18.769 --> 03:20.200
They haven't even taken
the banner down

03:20.200 --> 03:21.332
from three months ago.

03:21.332 --> 03:22.933
"Have a great summer."

03:22.933 --> 03:24.675
I had a lousy one.

03:24.675 --> 03:26.277
No banner's gonna tell me
what to do.

03:28.609 --> 03:30.741
Hey, Lindsay,
you're not wearing a hat.

03:30.741 --> 03:32.383
You look great.
I love the new look.

03:32.383 --> 03:33.814
Yeah.
It wasn't intentional.

03:33.814 --> 03:35.316
My hat blew off.
I look like a freak!

03:35.316 --> 03:36.587
I need to hide!

03:38.249 --> 03:39.920
So how is everyone?

03:41.722 --> 03:44.495
Well, I'm really excited
for fresh-mammal year.

03:44.495 --> 03:46.627
That's a thing
I promised somebody I'd try.

03:46.627 --> 03:48.299
Didn't work.
Forget it ever happened.

03:49.700 --> 03:51.732
Oh, there's
the new principal.

03:51.732 --> 03:53.364
Apparently,
he's always eavesdropping

03:53.364 --> 03:54.765
on students' conversations.

03:54.765 --> 03:56.267
I heard that.

03:56.267 --> 03:57.638
I listen to you kids
to make sure

03:57.638 --> 03:59.009
that you're following
the rules.

03:59.009 --> 04:00.641
I'm a stickler for rules.
Here.

04:00.641 --> 04:02.343
Have a "stickler
for rules" sticker.

04:02.343 --> 04:03.344
But don't stick them
on school property.

04:03.344 --> 04:04.615
That's a rule.

04:06.647 --> 04:08.979
You guys ready
for the best senior prank ever?

04:08.979 --> 04:10.351
Aren't senior pranks
supposed to be--

04:10.351 --> 04:11.482
At the end of the year,

04:11.482 --> 04:13.754
yes, but this way I can...

04:13.754 --> 04:15.426
enjoy the glory.

04:15.426 --> 04:16.557
Couldn't remember
if it was "bask"

04:16.557 --> 04:18.289
or "baste," could you?

04:18.289 --> 04:20.431
No, I could not
but I found a workaround.

04:20.431 --> 04:22.493
So the prank
is ready to go.

04:22.493 --> 04:24.865
Countdown to awesome!

04:24.865 --> 04:26.837
10... 9...

04:26.837 --> 04:27.938
awesome!

04:37.408 --> 04:38.879
Water slide!

04:50.421 --> 04:53.324
What happened?
What's going on?

04:53.324 --> 04:54.465
That's right.

04:54.465 --> 04:55.466
Listen up, everybody!

04:55.466 --> 04:56.597
I'm Tyler James.

04:56.597 --> 04:59.370
And I did this.

04:59.370 --> 05:02.002
I heard that.

05:02.002 --> 05:04.605
Though the way you shouted,
even my mom in Tucson heard it.

05:04.605 --> 05:06.737
She called to say,
"Get that Tyler James kid."

05:06.737 --> 05:08.509
So I will.

05:08.509 --> 05:09.910
This school has
a zero tolerance policy

05:09.910 --> 05:10.911
for senior pranks.

05:10.911 --> 05:11.912
You're expelled.

05:13.344 --> 05:15.446
Making you proud, Mama!

05:15.446 --> 05:16.947
( bell ringing )

05:16.947 --> 05:18.719
Everybody to class!
Here we go.

05:23.323 --> 05:25.526
What is going on?

05:28.829 --> 05:32.002
Go ahead.
It's your move, boo.

05:32.002 --> 05:34.064
Are they still pretending
to be boyfriend and girlfriend?

05:34.064 --> 05:37.738
It's developmentally appropriate
role-playing at this age.

05:37.738 --> 05:39.470
Like when we make
cleaning the house

05:39.470 --> 05:41.011
more fun by pretending
to be dust thieves.

05:41.011 --> 05:42.643
That's not role-playing.

05:42.643 --> 05:46.116
That's just
you being... super cute.

05:48.449 --> 05:49.550
I don't like that.

05:49.550 --> 05:51.021
I'm going to try again.

05:51.021 --> 05:52.853
Wait, you don't get
to go again.

05:52.853 --> 05:54.785
You rolled a seven,
you have to move seven.

05:54.785 --> 05:57.488
Tiffany lets me roll
until I get a number I like.

05:57.488 --> 05:58.789
Who's Tiffany?

05:58.789 --> 06:00.360
One of my
other girlfriends.

06:00.360 --> 06:01.492
One, two, three--

06:01.492 --> 06:02.493
Whoa!
Back up.

06:02.493 --> 06:04.635
Three, two, one.

06:04.635 --> 06:06.767
I don't mean
back up your piece.

06:06.767 --> 06:09.039
I mean, how many girlfriends
do you have?

06:11.371 --> 06:12.503
You have four?

06:12.503 --> 06:15.105
Yes.

06:15.105 --> 06:16.847
You can't have four.

06:16.847 --> 06:18.479
We never said
we wouldn't have play dates

06:18.479 --> 06:19.550
with other people.

06:19.550 --> 06:20.581
Where's your bathroom?

06:24.615 --> 06:26.757
I can't believe it, Stan.

06:26.757 --> 06:28.689
He's having play dates
with other girls.

06:28.689 --> 06:30.491
What should I do?

06:30.491 --> 06:31.592
Should I break up
with him?

06:31.592 --> 06:33.494
I don't know, Chloe.

06:33.494 --> 06:35.626
On the one hand, if you want
a committed relationship

06:35.626 --> 06:37.067
and he can't give you that,

06:37.067 --> 06:38.529
then you shouldn't
invest time

06:38.529 --> 06:39.600
where there's no future.

06:39.600 --> 06:41.031
On the other hand,

06:41.031 --> 06:43.534
you're both eight!

06:43.534 --> 06:44.975
Thanks, Stan.

06:44.975 --> 06:46.577
I think I know
what I need to do.

06:46.577 --> 06:47.878
I couldn't find
the bathroom,

06:47.878 --> 06:49.540
but I found
the banana room.

06:49.540 --> 06:51.011
You mean the kitchen?

06:52.543 --> 06:54.044
Mason,
I can't see you anymore.

06:54.044 --> 06:56.416
I'm right here.

06:56.416 --> 06:58.549
No, I can see you

06:58.549 --> 07:00.551
but I just can't be
your girlfriend anymore.

07:00.551 --> 07:02.022
I don't understand.

07:02.022 --> 07:04.555
Is it because I peed
in your banana room?

07:04.555 --> 07:06.126
No.

07:06.126 --> 07:08.158
It's because
you have other girlfriends.

07:08.158 --> 07:09.760
And now it's also partly

07:09.760 --> 07:11.702
because you peed
in my banana room.

07:14.935 --> 07:16.206
( sighs )

07:16.206 --> 07:17.838
Oh, boy.

07:18.709 --> 07:20.511
Honey,

07:20.511 --> 07:22.012
I know something's been
bothering you lately.

07:22.012 --> 07:23.574
What is it?

07:23.574 --> 07:25.746
I think
my thumbs are shrinking.

07:27.447 --> 07:28.949
Honey, you're just
pulling them down.

07:28.949 --> 07:30.751
I'm just giving you
a time lapse

07:30.751 --> 07:33.123
of what it's going to
look like in a year.

07:33.123 --> 07:34.585
Tell me, Bennett.

07:34.585 --> 07:36.657
Tell me.
What do you think?

07:38.689 --> 07:39.760
Tyler!
Hey, buddy.

07:39.760 --> 07:41.231
How was school today?

07:41.231 --> 07:42.232
Oh, you haven't heard?

07:42.232 --> 07:43.764
Heard what?

07:43.764 --> 07:45.596
How awesome
you guys are.

07:45.596 --> 07:47.467
Yeah, I-- All I could
talk about at school was

07:47.467 --> 07:48.639
how awesome and understanding
my parents are.

07:48.639 --> 07:50.040
BOTH: You got expelled?

07:52.002 --> 07:53.203
How did you get that
from awesome and understanding?

07:53.203 --> 07:55.145
The same way
we knew that

07:55.145 --> 07:57.077
"I want to grow up
to be like both of you" meant--

07:57.077 --> 07:58.909
BOTH: "The reindeer
from the Christmas tree lot is

07:58.909 --> 08:00.551
tied up in my bedroom."

08:01.752 --> 08:03.614
This was
just a fun prank.

08:03.614 --> 08:05.516
And it was nothing
like that Blitzen incident.

08:05.516 --> 08:06.687
In this case, no-one
got scratched by an antler,

08:06.687 --> 08:08.088
stepped on by a hoof,

08:08.088 --> 08:09.760
or had their ear
viciously nibbled.

08:09.760 --> 08:11.562
Why did he do
all those things to me?

08:12.963 --> 08:14.965
Look,
this is serious, Tyler.

08:14.965 --> 08:16.827
Getting expelled is the worst
punishment you can get.

08:16.827 --> 08:18.599
No, losing your trust
is the worst punishment

08:18.599 --> 08:20.070
because you're
the greatest parents ever.

08:20.070 --> 08:22.803
BOTH: You're calling us
from jail?

08:24.174 --> 08:27.077
Mom, Dad,
don't be so mad at Tyler.

08:27.077 --> 08:29.079
Getting expelled
wasn't all his fault.

08:29.079 --> 08:30.581
Oh, really?
Whose fault was it?

08:30.581 --> 08:31.642
Mine.

08:31.642 --> 08:33.013
It was all my fault.

08:33.013 --> 08:34.645
Tyler,
you don't have to do that.

08:34.645 --> 08:36.617
Avery,
thanks for trying to help.

08:36.617 --> 08:38.218
But I'm going to have to
accept responsibility for this.

08:38.218 --> 08:39.820
Well, I just don't know
what to say, Tyler.

08:39.820 --> 08:41.652
I was hoping
you would graduate

08:41.652 --> 08:43.954
while I was still able
to give you the thumbs up.

08:43.954 --> 08:45.525
Time is running out.

08:49.029 --> 08:50.901
The whole prank
was my idea, Stan.

08:50.901 --> 08:52.663
And when I started
to say that,

08:52.663 --> 08:54.264
Tyler jumped in
and took all the blame.

08:54.264 --> 08:55.836
And are you wearing
my dad's bike shorts?

08:57.668 --> 08:59.740
What choice do I have
if I want to ride a bike?

08:59.740 --> 09:01.672
Good point.

09:01.672 --> 09:03.674
I just feel so guilty
about Tyler.

09:03.674 --> 09:05.075
When dogs feel guilty,

09:05.075 --> 09:06.577
we put our tail
between our legs.

09:06.577 --> 09:08.048
I don't have a tail.

09:08.048 --> 09:10.250
So you're saying
I may not have helped you

09:10.250 --> 09:12.683
by cutting holes
in the back of all your pants.

09:12.683 --> 09:14.855
Man, I feel really bad
about that.

09:17.828 --> 09:19.960
It's just not right
that I'm not sharing the blame.

09:19.960 --> 09:21.862
Not that I'd get in trouble
anyway.

09:21.862 --> 09:23.694
Teachers love me.

09:23.694 --> 09:25.295
In fact,
I bet if I confess,

09:25.295 --> 09:27.037
nothing will even
happen to me

09:27.037 --> 09:28.799
and Tyler won't be
in trouble anymore.

09:28.799 --> 09:30.270
I'll probably
get a school spirit medal.

09:30.270 --> 09:31.872
You're expelled.

09:31.872 --> 09:34.705
That's not a school
spirit medal.

09:34.705 --> 09:36.076
( clattering )

09:38.809 --> 09:40.280
STAN: Ride a bike...

09:40.280 --> 09:41.682
check.

09:43.053 --> 09:44.985
Geez, there's no rule
against this.

09:46.687 --> 09:47.858
I don't know what to do.

09:53.123 --> 09:55.595
What do you mean,
I'm expelled?

09:55.595 --> 09:57.297
How can I be expelled?

09:57.297 --> 10:01.001
There's a zero tolerance
policy for senior pranks.

10:01.001 --> 10:02.602
You just told me
that you planned the one

10:02.602 --> 10:03.734
yesterday with your brother.

10:03.734 --> 10:05.135
But Principal Lawson...

10:05.135 --> 10:07.738
I am no longer
your principal,

10:07.738 --> 10:09.880
so you can call me Tim.

10:09.880 --> 10:11.211
I know
that doesn't make this better,

10:11.211 --> 10:12.212
but it's a fact.

10:14.384 --> 10:15.686
Avery...

10:15.686 --> 10:17.748
What just happened?

10:17.748 --> 10:20.050
I can't be expelled
from school.

10:20.050 --> 10:22.392
This is the worst thing
that's ever happened to me.

10:22.392 --> 10:23.794
Oh, Avery...

10:23.794 --> 10:24.925
Come on.

10:27.828 --> 10:29.760
( laughing )

10:29.760 --> 10:31.131
I'm sorry, guys.

10:31.131 --> 10:32.763
I laugh
in upsetting situations.

10:32.763 --> 10:33.764
I'm a sad-laugher.

10:33.764 --> 10:35.205
It's a thing.

10:36.336 --> 10:38.008
This is sad.

10:38.008 --> 10:39.770
I love school
more than anything.

10:39.770 --> 10:41.712
Oh, Avery...

10:43.774 --> 10:44.975
( laughing )

10:46.076 --> 10:47.848
I'm trying to get help.

10:47.848 --> 10:49.920
I'm in a support group.
There they are now.

10:51.782 --> 10:54.024
Cindy's boyfriend
just broke up with her.

10:57.127 --> 10:58.929
How could
they expel you?

10:58.929 --> 11:00.430
I don't know.

11:00.430 --> 11:01.862
Tim just wouldn't listen.

11:05.065 --> 11:07.337
Now how will I get into
a top college?

11:07.337 --> 11:09.269
How will I become
president one day

11:09.269 --> 11:11.201
with this black mark
on my record?

11:11.201 --> 11:14.705
It'll be okay, Avery.
We'll figure something out.

11:14.705 --> 11:17.207
We'll just dig up worse dirt
on your political opponents.

11:18.879 --> 11:22.352
But I wanted to run
a clean campaign.

11:22.352 --> 11:25.685
The leaks will never be
traced back to you.

11:25.685 --> 11:26.757
Trust your mother.

11:32.993 --> 11:34.765
Okay, Chloe.
Go get it.

11:38.999 --> 11:41.171
I don't think this is how fetch
is supposed to work.

11:41.171 --> 11:43.073
No, I'm pretty
sure it is.

11:45.405 --> 11:46.406
Hi, Chloe.

11:47.838 --> 11:49.379
I'm here for our play date.

11:49.379 --> 11:52.012
No more play dates.
We broke up, remember?

11:52.012 --> 11:54.084
I thought that was
just for yesterday.

11:54.084 --> 11:55.846
No.
It's for every day.

11:55.846 --> 11:58.488
Okay, I'll go.
See you tomorrow.

12:00.090 --> 12:02.052
Mason, no.
That's not what I mean.

12:02.052 --> 12:03.994
I don't understand.

12:03.994 --> 12:07.227
Man, I bet this is why
they say break ups are hard.

12:08.899 --> 12:10.761
You want to know
what else is hard?

12:10.761 --> 12:13.503
The floor at the bottom
of a spiral staircase.

12:18.138 --> 12:19.870
You need to go, Mason,
and think about

12:19.870 --> 12:20.871
what you really want.

12:20.871 --> 12:22.042
I want a pretzel.

12:24.044 --> 12:26.346
I get why he's so popular
with the ladies.

12:27.978 --> 12:30.220
Yup.
There's something about him.

12:35.525 --> 12:38.488
Sweetie, you've been obsessing
all day about being expelled.

12:38.488 --> 12:40.290
Take your mind off
of it for a little while.

12:40.290 --> 12:42.432
Come watch some judge shows
with your mom.

12:42.432 --> 12:45.035
I can't. I've got to figure out
a way to get back into school.

12:45.035 --> 12:46.336
I don't have time to hear about
how you would

12:46.336 --> 12:48.198
have made
a fantastic judge.

12:48.198 --> 12:50.070
You know, I would have made
a fantastic judge.

12:51.541 --> 12:53.243
"You're charged
with singing songs

12:53.243 --> 12:55.175
in the shower and waking
your neighbors.

12:55.175 --> 12:59.779
I find you guilty of assault
with a medley weapon."

12:59.779 --> 13:00.780
Good one, your honor.

13:01.912 --> 13:04.214
Good morning, everyone.

13:04.214 --> 13:06.486
Tyler,
it's 3 in the afternoon.

13:06.486 --> 13:07.487
Are you just waking up?

13:10.560 --> 13:11.561
No.

13:13.293 --> 13:15.165
So you loving
your vacay as much as I am?

13:15.165 --> 13:18.128
Expulsion is not vacay.
Quit calling it vacay.

13:18.128 --> 13:20.370
It's a totes horb sitch.

13:20.370 --> 13:22.002
Oh, my gosh, I've got
to get back into school.

13:22.933 --> 13:24.504
It's okay.

13:24.504 --> 13:26.376
The more words you lose,
the happier you'll.

13:29.109 --> 13:30.140
No, Tyler.

13:30.140 --> 13:31.882
I've figured it out.

13:31.882 --> 13:32.883
I've been reviewing
the school bylaws.

13:32.883 --> 13:34.414
And it says,

13:34.414 --> 13:36.847
we can appeal the expulsion
to a tribunal.

13:36.847 --> 13:38.949
If we win,
we're back in.

13:38.949 --> 13:40.820
No way.
I like not going to.

13:43.353 --> 13:44.494
Well, we're gonna
have to figure out

13:44.494 --> 13:45.825
some school for you both.

13:45.825 --> 13:46.997
You have to graduate.

13:46.997 --> 13:48.498
I'll go to school here.

13:48.498 --> 13:50.160
You can do
that home schooling thing.

13:50.160 --> 13:51.862
Tyler,
home schooling is serious.

13:51.862 --> 13:52.903
It's a lot of work,
and I don't know

13:52.903 --> 13:54.564
if I'm up to it.

13:54.564 --> 13:56.466
It's not like being a TV judge
where you can just say,

13:56.466 --> 13:58.208
"You stole cleaning supplies
from a department store.

13:58.208 --> 13:59.910
You're guilty
of mop-lifting."

14:01.371 --> 14:02.572
My judgments
have a comedic bent.

14:02.572 --> 14:04.374
I'm fair but funny.

14:04.374 --> 14:06.176
Come on, Mom.

14:06.176 --> 14:08.518
If you teach us, it'll be
a chance for us to bond.

14:08.518 --> 14:09.519
I do like bonding.

14:11.181 --> 14:12.983
Mom isn't a teacher,
she's a judge.

14:12.983 --> 14:15.385
I am more of a judge.

14:15.385 --> 14:17.227
Nothing you can say
will convince me

14:17.227 --> 14:18.458
that learning at home
isn't better than

14:18.458 --> 14:20.290
getting unexpelled.

14:20.290 --> 14:22.232
If we learn at home,
the hottest chick in school

14:22.232 --> 14:24.094
will be your sister.

14:24.094 --> 14:25.966
We need to go to the tribunal
and get unexpelled.

14:30.500 --> 14:32.572
Hey, Chloe, you want
to see my new trick?

14:32.572 --> 14:35.475
Rub my belly and pat my head
at the same time.

14:35.475 --> 14:36.576
Okay.

14:39.609 --> 14:41.281
So what's the trick?

14:41.281 --> 14:42.953
I tricked you into rubbing
my belly

14:42.953 --> 14:44.484
and patting my head
at the same time.

14:46.016 --> 14:47.287
( doorbell ringing )

14:53.023 --> 14:56.326
Mason, I can't hear any music.
Your headphones are plugged in.

14:56.326 --> 14:59.599
What? I can't hear you!
My headphones are plugged in!

15:01.001 --> 15:03.233
Unplug your headphones!

15:03.233 --> 15:05.275
What?
I can't hear you!

15:05.275 --> 15:08.038
Should I unplug
my headphones?

15:08.038 --> 15:09.379
Yes!

15:09.379 --> 15:10.380
What?

15:13.213 --> 15:15.185
♪ When you're driving
down the street ♪

15:15.185 --> 15:16.947
It's your favorite song.

15:16.947 --> 15:18.388
Because I want you to be
my girlfriend again.

15:18.388 --> 15:20.590
It's not my favorite song.

15:20.590 --> 15:23.123
Maybe it was
Tiffany's favorite.

15:23.123 --> 15:24.224
Or Molly's.

15:24.224 --> 15:25.925
Or Chloe's?

15:25.925 --> 15:27.697
I'm Chloe!

15:29.299 --> 15:31.201
Mason, I like that
you made an effort.

15:31.201 --> 15:33.133
And we are just
in the third grade.

15:33.133 --> 15:35.705
Turn it off,
and I'll forgive you.

15:35.705 --> 15:37.667
That's making it louder.

15:37.667 --> 15:40.340
Now you just started it
from the beginning.

15:42.012 --> 15:44.114
I don't want to play
with other girls.

15:44.114 --> 15:46.146
I just want to have
play dates with you.

15:46.146 --> 15:47.577
Every single day.

15:47.577 --> 15:49.149
Okay.

15:50.950 --> 15:52.052
Thanks, Molly.

15:52.052 --> 15:53.653
I'm Chloe!

15:55.455 --> 15:57.457
Man, you're lucky
there's something about you.

16:04.264 --> 16:05.665
Max, you're on the tribunal?

16:05.665 --> 16:07.197
I'm the student rep.

16:07.197 --> 16:09.039
I have an interest
in tribunals

16:09.039 --> 16:11.101
because one of my ancestors
was declared a witch

16:11.101 --> 16:12.472
in 17th century Salem.

16:12.472 --> 16:14.104
Her family giggled in grief

16:14.104 --> 16:15.645
when she was
burned at the stake.

16:15.645 --> 16:17.477
It's hereditary.

16:17.477 --> 16:19.449
Quiet, everyone.

16:19.449 --> 16:21.551
Please take your seats
so we can get this over with.

16:21.551 --> 16:23.453
I have a very busy afternoon.

16:23.453 --> 16:25.255
I have to go pretend to care
about a volleyball game.

16:27.387 --> 16:29.459
Ladies and Gentlemen
of the tribunal,

16:29.459 --> 16:32.122
I will demonstrate,
incontrovertibly,

16:32.122 --> 16:33.623
and beyond
a reasonable doubt--

16:33.623 --> 16:34.624
Yeah, just call
your first witness.

16:34.624 --> 16:36.626
I object!

16:36.626 --> 16:38.398
The plaintiff should be allowed
to conclude her statement.

16:38.398 --> 16:40.430
This isn't a court,
and even if it were,

16:40.430 --> 16:42.132
you don't get to object.

16:42.132 --> 16:43.603
I object to that, too.

16:47.006 --> 16:48.738
At home, I could just
go in the other room

16:48.738 --> 16:50.009
when she does this.

16:51.481 --> 16:53.513
Call your first witness,
Miss Jennings.

16:53.513 --> 16:56.146
I don't know
why I'm so nervous up here.

16:56.146 --> 16:57.787
I feel like I'm on trial.

16:57.787 --> 17:00.690
And I mean, it's not like
I've done anything wrong.

17:00.690 --> 17:02.222
All right, I confess!

17:02.222 --> 17:03.653
My dad bought us
two smoothies

17:03.653 --> 17:05.555
but he was
only charged for one!

17:05.555 --> 17:06.596
He didn't say anything!
And we drank them both!

17:06.596 --> 17:07.597
Go easy on him!

17:09.529 --> 17:12.432
Getting expelled has been
so hard on Avery and Tyler.

17:12.432 --> 17:15.034
I'm sorry I haven't been
there for you guys.

17:15.034 --> 17:18.668
I've been going through
a really messy break-up.

17:18.668 --> 17:20.170
But we're back
together now.

17:20.170 --> 17:21.541
It's been a roller coaster.

17:24.043 --> 17:26.316
My image is obscured
for my own protection.

17:26.316 --> 17:28.178
Certain members
of the cat mafia

17:28.178 --> 17:30.280
have made some threats.

17:30.280 --> 17:34.754
But I just want to say that
Avery and Tyler are great kids.

17:34.754 --> 17:36.526
They're loyal friends,

17:36.526 --> 17:38.428
they're always there for me,
and most of all,

17:38.428 --> 17:40.230
they pick up my poop
in the park.

17:43.193 --> 17:45.665
How did I get here?
I don't understand.

17:47.697 --> 17:51.201
I would now like to call
on my friends to testify.

17:51.201 --> 17:53.203
Unfortunately,
they're all in detention

17:53.203 --> 17:55.445
for jumping on the tables
and screaming in the cafeteria.

17:55.445 --> 17:57.577
But they told me
to do this.

17:57.577 --> 18:00.180
Whoo! Yeah!
That's right!

18:00.180 --> 18:01.551
Tyler's the man!

18:03.113 --> 18:04.484
I'll allow it.

18:06.286 --> 18:08.358
I put parental locks
on the court channel,

18:08.358 --> 18:10.260
but she figures out
the code.

18:11.721 --> 18:14.224
In conclusion,
as today's witnesses

18:14.224 --> 18:17.867
have made very clear,
we are good, honest people,

18:17.867 --> 18:20.230
the salt of the earth,
the kind of people

18:20.230 --> 18:21.501
who make America great.

18:21.501 --> 18:23.233
Am I exaggerating?
Yes.

18:23.233 --> 18:24.674
A very American trait.

18:24.674 --> 18:26.406
And it has been
for a million years.

18:31.281 --> 18:33.513
The point is,
we meant no harm

18:33.513 --> 18:36.246
and are very sorry
that we broke a rule.

18:36.246 --> 18:38.248
Tyler's a great guy.

18:38.248 --> 18:40.720
He took all the blame for
our parents just to protect me.

18:40.720 --> 18:43.693
And the only reason
Avery was expelled

18:43.693 --> 18:46.256
is because she confessed,
thinking it would help me.

18:46.256 --> 18:48.398
At least she should
get unexpelled.

18:48.398 --> 18:51.201
She's a great sister
and she doesn't deserve this.

18:51.201 --> 18:52.402
Thanks, Tyler.

18:56.366 --> 18:58.338
No, no.
No, no.

18:58.338 --> 19:00.640
Honey, honey, honey--
Please just sit down already.

19:00.640 --> 19:01.771
You're embarrassing
yourself.

19:01.771 --> 19:03.443
I'm not embarrassed.

19:03.443 --> 19:04.644
Okay, then
you're embarrassing me.

19:06.276 --> 19:07.747
As much as I'd like
to keep this going

19:07.747 --> 19:09.349
and miss
the volleyball game,

19:09.349 --> 19:10.650
it's happening here
in the commons

19:10.650 --> 19:11.721
and they have
to set up now.

19:13.823 --> 19:18.288
The appeal is denied.
The expulsion stands.

19:18.288 --> 19:20.390
It's the letter of the law.

19:20.390 --> 19:22.562
School rules clearly
state zero tolerance

19:22.562 --> 19:24.634
towards senior pranks.

19:24.634 --> 19:25.765
That concludes the tribunal.

19:28.898 --> 19:31.341
I'm really sorry, Avery.

19:31.341 --> 19:34.474
I shouldn't have let you
help me to begin with.

19:34.474 --> 19:36.546
It's a senior prank.
You're not even a senior.

19:38.948 --> 19:40.380
Wait a minute.

19:40.380 --> 19:42.952
I'm not a senior.
Hold on.

19:42.952 --> 19:44.384
Resume the tribunal!

19:46.316 --> 19:48.318
You don't get to resume
the tribunal.

19:48.318 --> 19:50.320
PLAYERS: Yeah!

19:50.320 --> 19:51.861
I get to resume
the tribunal.

19:51.861 --> 19:53.323
Tribunal resumed!

19:53.323 --> 19:55.365
PLAYERS: Oh!

19:55.365 --> 19:58.598
As I was saying,
the letter of the law says,

19:58.598 --> 20:01.801
"no senior pranks,"
but I'm not a senior,

20:01.801 --> 20:03.903
so by definition,
what I did can't be

20:03.903 --> 20:06.336
a senior prank,
so I can't be expelled!

20:06.336 --> 20:08.308
Well, that is the letter
of the law, but--

20:09.879 --> 20:12.342
Fine, Avery,
you're back in school.

20:12.342 --> 20:14.644
I am no longer
Tim to you.

20:14.644 --> 20:17.487
But Tyler, you are a senior.
You are still expelled.

20:17.487 --> 20:18.818
Call me Tim.

20:20.550 --> 20:22.252
Wait, wait.

20:22.252 --> 20:24.554
The prank was done
before the first bell

20:24.554 --> 20:26.296
on the first day of school.

20:26.296 --> 20:27.827
The school year
hadn't officially started yet.

20:27.827 --> 20:29.829
So Tyler wasn't
a senior either.

20:29.829 --> 20:31.631
Before the first bell,
Miss Jennings?

20:31.631 --> 20:33.433
I think that's a bit
of a technicality.

20:33.433 --> 20:35.405
No, it's the letter
of the law.

20:35.405 --> 20:36.906
Bam! In your face.

20:36.906 --> 20:38.538
Sorry, too far.
Principals love me.

20:38.538 --> 20:39.639
We're going to be
very good friends.

20:42.742 --> 20:44.374
Your punishment is reduced

20:44.374 --> 20:46.376
to a suspension of time
served plus

20:46.376 --> 20:48.378
however long this
volleyball game takes.

20:48.378 --> 20:49.919
I am not sitting
through it alone.

20:49.919 --> 20:51.821
No offense, coach.

20:56.856 --> 20:59.389
If only you were
in Salem in 1692,

20:59.389 --> 21:02.392
then my ancestor Goody Edelstein
would still be with us.

21:02.392 --> 21:04.494
Wouldn't she have passed
from natural causes by now?

21:04.494 --> 21:06.265
Maybe not.
She was a witch.

21:08.538 --> 21:10.340
STAN: It was nice
how Avery and Tyler stood up

21:10.340 --> 21:12.001
for each other today.

21:12.001 --> 21:13.943
And I learned something
really important.

21:13.943 --> 21:16.045
That Max's last name
is Edelstein.

21:16.045 --> 21:17.677
Who knew?

21:17.677 --> 21:20.410
And also
that pranks can be fun,

21:20.410 --> 21:22.452
but they can also
go too far.

21:22.452 --> 21:24.514
Especially
when the prankee decides

21:24.514 --> 21:26.556
to get even with the pranker.

21:29.058 --> 21:31.761
Touche, Robert. Touche.

21:37.967 --> 21:40.600
Mason, you just ate
the last five carrots.

21:40.600 --> 21:41.801
I wanted one.

21:41.801 --> 21:43.433
I'm sorry.

21:43.433 --> 21:44.604
I know how to make it up
to you.

21:49.439 --> 21:51.641
Mason, I told you,
I don't like that song.

21:51.641 --> 21:54.313
I don't understand.

21:54.313 --> 21:56.315
I don't understand either,
but somehow, we work.

21:59.819 --> 22:01.551
Bennett, why don't you
ever serenade me

22:01.551 --> 22:03.453
with a boombox
over your head?

22:03.453 --> 22:04.924
Because it's a cliche

22:04.924 --> 22:06.556
from an '80s teen
romantic comedy

22:06.556 --> 22:07.897
and I think
you're better than that.

22:12.462 --> 22:14.504
This makes me happy.

22:14.504 --> 22:16.406
I don't understand.
