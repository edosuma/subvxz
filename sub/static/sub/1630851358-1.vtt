00:10.875 --> 00:15.875
Hi. Unlike you, I'm Rob Lowe,
and I love movies.

00:15.958 --> 00:20.750
The fact is, I'd rather be watching
a movie than doing this right now.

00:20.833 --> 00:24.750
But let's pretend I didn't say that
and just enjoy each other's company.

00:25.541 --> 00:28.791
Thousands of movies
are released every year.

00:28.875 --> 00:30.291
That's a lot of stories,

00:30.375 --> 00:32.583
even though
according to screenwriting theory

00:32.666 --> 00:37.125
there are only seven basic plots:
overcoming the monster...

00:37.875 --> 00:39.083
and the other six.

00:40.416 --> 00:43.291
It's little wonder that stock characters,

00:43.375 --> 00:46.875
familiar story beats,
and convenient plot devices

00:46.958 --> 00:48.166
have crept in over time.

00:48.250 --> 00:52.708
Tonight, we celebrate the clichés
that have made cinema what it is today:

00:52.791 --> 00:55.666
struggling for relevance
in the aftermath of a pandemic.

00:56.458 --> 00:59.541
<i>Over the next hour,</i>
<i>we'll be looking at Tinseltown's habit</i>

00:59.625 --> 01:02.708
<i>of using</i>
<i>these handy cinematic tropes in...</i>

01:02.791 --> 01:05.583
Attack of the Hollywood Clichés!

01:05.666 --> 01:08.125
<i>We'll be asking questions like,</i>

01:08.208 --> 01:11.833
<i>"Why do women being chased</i>
<i>by large, scary dinosaurs</i>

01:11.916 --> 01:13.625
<i>have to do it in high heels?"</i>

01:14.250 --> 01:17.000
<i>As we build to some</i>
<i>of my favorite clichés,</i>

01:17.083 --> 01:20.791
<i>we'll be looking at some of the most</i>
<i>dramatic moments in cinema.</i>

01:21.375 --> 01:23.458
<i>Some of the most controversial.</i>

01:23.541 --> 01:26.333
Sister is teaching the mothers
how to wash their children.

01:26.416 --> 01:29.416
[Lowe] <i>How other clichés have been raised</i>
<i>to a form of high art.</i>

01:29.500 --> 01:31.125
[tires screech]

01:31.208 --> 01:33.666
<i>And of course,</i>
<i>how Hollywood deals with sex.</i>

01:35.041 --> 01:36.083
<i>And violence.</i>

01:37.708 --> 01:40.750
And where better to begin
than with a familiar beginning,

01:40.833 --> 01:44.458
from the world of romantic comedy,
it's the meet cute.

01:47.208 --> 01:50.708
<i>That magical moment in movies</i>
<i>when the love begins.</i>

01:50.791 --> 01:53.708
People watch romcoms to get high.

01:53.791 --> 01:57.250
<i>They wanna experience</i>
<i>that first sensation of love</i>

01:57.333 --> 02:00.750
<i>so that when they see those two people</i>
<i>meet for the very first time,</i>

02:00.833 --> 02:03.500
<i>when that moment, that spark,</i>

02:03.583 --> 02:05.583
<i>that chemistry happens,</i>

02:05.666 --> 02:07.541
it feels so real to them

02:07.625 --> 02:09.666
that they have that sensation
in their body.

02:09.750 --> 02:13.625
There's always some funny, contrived
reason why you have the two people

02:13.708 --> 02:15.916
who are gonna fall in love meet,

02:16.000 --> 02:17.500
<i>because it has to be interesting.</i>

02:17.583 --> 02:20.333
<i>They can't meet</i>
<i>the way regular people meet.</i>

02:21.000 --> 02:23.666
-Lady, keep driving.
-[screams] Get out!

02:23.750 --> 02:27.333
Some kind of embarrassing,
comedic, unlikely scenario...

02:28.666 --> 02:30.083
that brings the two together.

02:30.166 --> 02:33.791
I live just over the street.
I have, um, water and soap.

02:33.875 --> 02:35.000
You can get cleaned up.

02:35.083 --> 02:36.958
[Pugh]<i> If that happened in real life,</i>

02:37.041 --> 02:40.208
you would throw
the rest of your juice in their face.

02:40.291 --> 02:42.625
You'd be like, "No, get away from me."

02:42.708 --> 02:45.416
In five minutes,
we can have you spick and span

02:45.500 --> 02:46.875
and back on the street again,

02:46.958 --> 02:49.291
in the non-prostitute sense, obviously.

02:50.250 --> 02:52.375
[Lowe] <i>Whenever two people</i>
<i>fall in love in a film,</i>

02:52.458 --> 02:57.208
<i>whatever the genre, the clichés</i>
<i>of cinematic romance are ever present.</i>

02:57.916 --> 03:03.791
I hate the water,
and I hate being wet, and I hate you!

03:03.875 --> 03:04.958
Good!

03:05.041 --> 03:08.041
They don't like each other,
are engaged or married to someone else.

03:08.125 --> 03:10.000
Jack, I'm engaged.

03:11.208 --> 03:12.666
I'm marrying Cal.

03:12.750 --> 03:17.041
There has to be a struggle
to go through or else it would be boring.

03:17.875 --> 03:19.875
[Lowe] <i>Of course, this being the movies,</i>

03:19.958 --> 03:24.458
<i>male strategies vary from annoying</i>
<i>persistence to outright harassment.</i>

03:25.125 --> 03:27.458
Well, how about this for a coincidence?

03:27.541 --> 03:31.208
A lot of films which are shown
from the male point of view

03:31.291 --> 03:33.625
feature what you would
really call stalking.

03:33.708 --> 03:35.416
You wanna dance with me?

03:35.500 --> 03:36.750
No.

03:36.833 --> 03:37.833
Why not?

03:37.916 --> 03:39.583
Because I don't want to.

03:39.666 --> 03:41.875
-Well, will you go out with me?
-What?

03:42.625 --> 03:44.583
-No!
-No?

03:44.666 --> 03:46.333
-No!
-No?

03:46.416 --> 03:48.708
-Hey, pal, she just told you.
-Why not?

03:48.791 --> 03:52.375
Like in <i>Twilight,</i> when he
climbs up through her window

03:52.458 --> 03:54.708
<i>and says, "I like watching you sleep."</i>

03:54.791 --> 03:56.041
Do you do that a lot?

03:57.708 --> 03:59.750
Just the past couple of months.

03:59.833 --> 04:03.625
Stalking is sexy only applies
when it's men stalking women.

04:03.708 --> 04:08.250
When women are persistent
or stalking male characters,

04:08.333 --> 04:09.666
<i>they become the villain.</i>

04:09.750 --> 04:11.416
I just wanna be a part of your life.

04:11.500 --> 04:14.166
And this is the way you do it, huh?
Showing up at my apartment?

04:14.250 --> 04:15.750
What am I supposed to do?

04:15.833 --> 04:18.083
You won't answer my calls,
you change your number.

04:18.166 --> 04:20.333
I'm not gonna be ignored, Dan.

04:22.083 --> 04:25.541
[Lowe] <i>Every story needs a lead character</i>
<i>who commands attention,</i>

04:25.625 --> 04:28.458
someone as unique, special,
and one-of-a-kind

04:28.541 --> 04:30.208
as the lead in every other movie.

04:30.291 --> 04:33.416
Since all aspects of your protagonists
have to be remarkable,

04:33.500 --> 04:35.750
it's not enough for them
to just have a job.

04:35.833 --> 04:39.291
Whatever that job is,
they gotta job the shit out of it,

04:39.375 --> 04:43.625
especially if their job is the job:
the cop's job.

04:44.625 --> 04:46.375
-You think I'm crazy?
-Yeah.

04:46.458 --> 04:47.291
[Lowe] <i>In Hollywood,</i>

<i>top of the law-enforcement tree</i>
<i>is the maverick cop.</i>

04:54.416 --> 04:57.708
Now, that's a real badge, I'm a real cop,
and this is a real fucking gun.

04:57.791 --> 05:01.083
The maverick cop is a badass,
he doesn't listen to the chief.

05:01.166 --> 05:05.041
You wanna play some bullshit cowboy cop,
go do it in somebody else's precinct.

05:05.125 --> 05:07.333
They are completely dysfunctional.

05:07.416 --> 05:10.041
He's probably an alcoholic,
terrible father.

05:10.125 --> 05:13.916
You're my daughter, in my house,
and you'll respect me, got that?

05:14.000 --> 05:16.500
-Don't call me a fuck-up.
-Why shouldn't I?

05:16.583 --> 05:17.958
Mom calls you one.

05:18.041 --> 05:20.208
They only care about the job.

05:20.291 --> 05:22.250
No bullshit. You wanna kill yourself?

05:22.333 --> 05:24.625
You know why I don't do it? The job.

05:24.708 --> 05:26.541

05:49.750 --> 05:51.583

10:25.458 --> 10:28.833
-[French folk music playing]
-<i>The French have a word for clichés,</i>

10:28.916 --> 10:32.833
<i>but in cinema, one of the most</i>
<i>clichéd cities is Paris.</i>

10:32.916 --> 10:35.666
<i>But how can we tell we're in Paris?</i>

10:35.750 --> 10:37.375
<i>Because the director makes sure</i>

10:37.458 --> 10:40.750
<i>we can see the Eiffel Tower</i>
<i>through the bedroom window.</i>

10:42.625 --> 10:43.875
<i>The loft window.</i>

10:44.666 --> 10:46.166
<i>The train window.</i>

10:46.250 --> 10:48.125
<i>From the balcony.</i>

10:48.208 --> 10:49.958
<i>Through a clock.</i>

10:50.041 --> 10:50.958
<i>Unfortunately,</i>

10:51.041 --> 10:56.166
<i>that means the Eiffel Tower is on the top</i>
<i>of every invaders' to-destroy list.</i>

10:57.083 --> 10:58.916
Actors love working with props

10:59.000 --> 11:01.875
because like all good co-stars,
they never hog the scenes.

11:01.958 --> 11:03.750
And they're usually paid less.

11:03.833 --> 11:05.333
An everyday seeming prop

11:05.416 --> 11:08.541
can make even the most godlike figure
seem like a regular Joe.

11:08.625 --> 11:11.875
Admit it, this grocery-bag baguette combo
I'm holding

11:11.958 --> 11:14.708
has made me seem 26% more relatable.

11:14.791 --> 11:17.416
I haven't bought or eaten bread
in over ten years.

11:17.500 --> 11:18.916
The bag is only a cover

11:19.000 --> 11:22.250
to stop me from inadvertently absorbing
the carbs through my skin.

11:22.333 --> 11:24.083
All movie stars insist on it.

11:24.625 --> 11:27.750
<i>Often, lead actors</i>
<i>have to come across as regular Joes</i>

11:27.833 --> 11:29.375
<i>who do their own shopping,</i>

11:29.458 --> 11:33.541
<i>and a highly visible baguette sticking</i>
<i>out of the bag is parfait pour la job.</i>

11:34.125 --> 11:36.458
<i>It can also be ideal for hiding behind.</i>

11:37.083 --> 11:39.083
<i>The intensity of the performance</i>

11:39.166 --> 11:41.541
<i>is matched only</i>
<i>by the quantity of the bread.</i>

11:41.625 --> 11:44.375
Still warm.
It's the best bread I ever tasted.

11:45.041 --> 11:46.250
[Lowe] <i>What a professional.</i>

11:47.250 --> 11:51.833
One expressive prop
that actors love is the apple,

11:51.916 --> 11:54.833
despite it having
a shocking 19 grams of sugar.

11:57.375 --> 12:00.625
Tell me when you got enough
so I can spit this shit out.

12:04.958 --> 12:08.541
Eating in a scene
definitely is the cocky move.

12:08.625 --> 12:12.958
It's kind of like the ultimate
"I'm here and I don't care."

12:16.750 --> 12:18.708

<i>Or snacking between meals</i>
<i>while meeting a superior officer.</i>

12:22.875 --> 12:24.375
Lieutenant Commander Galloway.

12:24.458 --> 12:26.708
[Lowe]
<i>An apple is the clichéd way of saying,</i>

12:26.791 --> 12:28.750
<i>"I'm too cool for school,"</i>

12:28.833 --> 12:31.208
<i>while lowering cholesterol</i>
<i>and promoting gut health.</i>

12:32.625 --> 12:34.166
The way your movie is cast

12:34.250 --> 12:36.458
depends on what kind of story
you're telling.

12:36.541 --> 12:39.208
Some stories require a director
to thoughtfully curate

12:39.291 --> 12:41.958
an ensemble
of subtly different personality types,

12:42.041 --> 12:45.125
<i>and some movies</i>
<i>just need a big guy who kills people.</i>

12:45.208 --> 12:46.875
[gunshots]

12:46.958 --> 12:49.416
Cinema likes
to tell us that the individual

12:49.500 --> 12:50.666
can take on the system,

12:50.750 --> 12:55.208
and one way it tells us this is possible
is via the one-man army.

12:55.291 --> 12:59.083
<i>You can see this right back</i>
<i>in the sort of Robin Hood,</i>

12:59.166 --> 13:01.166
<i>Errol Flynn films.</i>

13:01.958 --> 13:05.708
<i>You can see it going right through</i>
<i>the Western genre.</i>

13:06.500 --> 13:08.958
<i>You see it, arguably, in James Bond.</i>

13:11.666 --> 13:13.000
It changed in the '80s

13:13.083 --> 13:17.875
when your bodybuilders came into fashion.
Arnold Schwarzenegger, most famously,

13:17.958 --> 13:23.166
Stallone, they all of a sudden
didn't really look like blokes we knew.

13:23.250 --> 13:24.500
<i>They looked superhuman.</i>

13:26.208 --> 13:29.875
When you get Stallone
behind that weapon of mass destruction.

13:31.791 --> 13:34.416
<i>Twenty men being blown to smithereens.</i>

13:34.500 --> 13:39.083
Totally satisfying experience
in carnage and destruction,

13:39.166 --> 13:43.000
<i>with an absolute disregard</i>
<i>for human beings,</i>

13:43.083 --> 13:45.000
um, which you want in those movies.

13:45.083 --> 13:48.833
I think the invincibility
and the indomitability

13:48.916 --> 13:52.208
of the '80s action movie macho hero

13:52.291 --> 13:56.791
<i>became the key</i>
<i>for them becoming franchises.</i>

13:56.875 --> 13:58.583
<i>And then </i>Die Hard<i> came in,</i>

13:58.666 --> 14:02.541
<i>a film that starts out</i>
<i>relatively realistically.</i>

14:02.625 --> 14:05.166
<i>Bruce Willis seems like an ordinary bloke.</i>

14:05.250 --> 14:08.000
Drop it, dickhead. It's the police.

14:08.083 --> 14:09.333
Hang on, John!

14:09.416 --> 14:11.791
[Newman]
<i>But then, by the time of part five,</i>

14:11.875 --> 14:14.875
<i>basically, he could</i>
<i>take Superman down in part five.</i>

14:16.958 --> 14:20.125
The skills
are being physically very capable,

14:20.208 --> 14:22.458
<i>more than normal human beings.</i>

14:24.125 --> 14:27.041
They tend to be very much
the strong, silent type.

14:27.125 --> 14:30.166
The one place
where the one-man army will speak up

14:30.250 --> 14:33.666
is immediately after
or just before killing somebody.

14:33.750 --> 14:34.916
We're married.

14:35.625 --> 14:38.791
[O'Hara] <i>The master of the form</i>
<i>is Arnold Schwarzenegger.</i>

14:38.875 --> 14:40.000
Consider that a divorce.

14:40.625 --> 14:43.666
Sure, your main character
can run around firing guns

14:43.750 --> 14:47.458
and bazookas at every school bus
like the hero they are,

14:47.541 --> 14:49.291
but if they wanna earn our respect,

14:49.375 --> 14:52.833
there comes a time when they'll
have to throw down those firearms

14:52.916 --> 14:54.541
and pick up their fists...

14:55.875 --> 14:56.958
with both hands.

14:59.416 --> 15:01.500
[Newman] <i>Throughout the silent era,</i>

15:01.583 --> 15:04.916
characters on screen had to
express themselves physically

15:05.000 --> 15:07.666
because people got bored
with the intertitle.

15:07.750 --> 15:09.833
<i>They laughed at the flowery prose.</i>

15:09.916 --> 15:12.833
So, what you get was lengthy fight scenes.

15:14.166 --> 15:17.208
<i>Officially,</i>
<i>the first staged fist-fight for film</i>

15:17.291 --> 15:20.875
<i>was the big fight</i>
<i>on top of and inside a train</i>

15:20.958 --> 15:22.875
<i>in </i>The Great Train Robbery.

15:22.958 --> 15:25.208
[Lowe] <i>Fast forward 100 years or so,</i>

15:25.291 --> 15:27.375
<i>and we still have guys</i>
<i>beating up on each other</i>

15:27.458 --> 15:30.750
<i>on moving trains,</i>
<i>just in slightly more expensive suits.</i>

15:31.916 --> 15:34.458
Something that I've loved
seeing in the last ten years

15:34.541 --> 15:39.291
is fight scenes getting more gritty
and gross to watch.

15:39.375 --> 15:40.833
[man grunts]

15:40.916 --> 15:44.000
The other kind of fantastic,
I think, cliché,

15:44.083 --> 15:46.916
that makes it more manageable
for us as an audience

15:47.000 --> 15:50.666
is when all of the attackers
come out one by one.

15:50.750 --> 15:52.333

15:52.416 --> 15:56.666
<i>In </i>Oldboy,
in the amazing scene in the corridor,

15:56.750 --> 16:00.791
you're placing your attention
on one kill at a time.

16:04.000 --> 16:06.916
It's kind of very related
to video games, I think,

16:07.000 --> 16:10.083
where this idea
that you might have all the skills

16:10.166 --> 16:14.375
and you're punching through,
but it just never ends.

16:15.333 --> 16:18.500
[Lowe] <i>The master of these "take a ticket</i>
<i>and wait till you're called" fights</i>

16:18.583 --> 16:20.458
<i>is the legendary Jackie Chan.</i>

16:21.208 --> 16:23.000
So Jackie Chan was my favorite.

16:24.041 --> 16:26.916
<i>The reason he was so popular</i>
<i>is he went against cliché</i>

16:27.000 --> 16:30.458
<i>and became the hero</i>
<i>who gets beat up the whole movie.</i>

16:31.291 --> 16:33.250
It's absurd what he's doing,

16:33.333 --> 16:36.208
<i>and it's without wires,</i>
<i>and it's death-defying.</i>

16:36.291 --> 16:38.250
<i>I feel like he's the person</i>

16:38.333 --> 16:41.208
that has had the most influence.
And it's all in camera.

16:42.083 --> 16:46.083
[Lowe] <i>And Jackie Chan's influence</i>
<i>can be seen in movies ever since.</i>

16:46.166 --> 16:51.333
Now you have fist fights that,
um, defy physiology,

16:51.416 --> 16:52.583
<i>physiognomy.</i>

16:52.666 --> 16:57.583
<i>If you hit somebody 50 times</i>
<i>and they get back up again,</i>

16:57.666 --> 16:59.375
<i>what is at stake?</i>

17:00.458 --> 17:02.000
What is finally gonna kill them?

17:03.333 --> 17:05.916
[Lowe]
<i>The evolution of big-screen punch-ups</i>

17:06.000 --> 17:09.041
<i>has seen the move more and more</i>
<i>from the balletic to the ballistic.</i>

17:09.708 --> 17:11.583
[Pugh] <i>It's that hand-to-hand combat</i>

17:11.666 --> 17:14.916
where they're smacking
each other's hands so fast,

17:15.000 --> 17:17.625
<i>that if you want to see what's going on,</i>
<i>you have to slow it down.</i>

17:18.250 --> 17:22.625
[Newman] <i>And then later on,</i>
<i>the recent rise of movies like </i>The Raid...

17:23.291 --> 17:25.791
<i>which are just nonstop fighting.</i>

17:26.416 --> 17:28.750
You can actually have a story
that is just people fighting.

17:32.416 --> 17:35.416
[Lowe] <i>From one type of intense</i>

17:47.083 --> 17:48.625
<i>of taste and decency,</i>

17:48.708 --> 17:50.958

17:54.333 --> 17:58.125
Take off your clothes,

17:58.208 --> 18:02.833
In the early 1930s, you had things
like Barbara Stanwyck in <i>Baby Face,</i>

18:07.250 --> 18:10.416

-Plenty.

[Lowe] <i>After a series of scandals</i>
<i>in the early '20s,</i>

18:24.958 --> 18:27.625
<i>the press declared Hollywood</i>
<i>morally bankrupt,</i>

<i>and a new code of conduct,</i>
<i>written by a priest,</i>

18:33.125 --> 18:35.666
[man]
<i>Reputable producers signed up Will Hays</i>

18:35.750 --> 18:37.666
<i>to clean up the picture business...</i>

18:37.750 --> 18:43.291
That prohibited any sexual depravity
from being shown on screen.

18:43.375 --> 18:47.666
The vulgar, the cheap,
and the tawdry is out.

18:48.291 --> 18:51.625
[Lowe] <i>By the '30s,</i>
<i>the Hays Code imposed strict rules</i>

18:51.708 --> 18:55.583
<i>dictating what movies could</i>
<i>and couldn't show, mainly couldn't.</i>

18:55.666 --> 18:59.291
[Richard] <i>One of the actor's legs</i>

How are you supposed to fuck people

19:03.666 --> 19:06.375
[Lowe] <i>But filmmakers</i>
<i>soon found ways to bend the rules,</i>

19:06.458 --> 19:10.583
<i>and the cinematic cliché</i>
<i>of sexual illusion became de rigueur.</i>

19:10.666 --> 19:15.708
How do you suggest the act of sex
without actually showing it?

19:17.708 --> 19:18.833
<i>Is it raining outside?</i>

19:18.916 --> 19:22.500
<i>There's a storm outside,</i>

[Jonathan] <i>You would go from them</i>

The first few times that happens,

[Helen] <i>In the 1960s,</i>

19:46.791 --> 19:49.375
Independent cinemas had begun to sprout up

19:49.458 --> 19:52.791
and they were bringing in
exciting new films from Europe,

19:52.875 --> 19:57.958
<i>often which had exciting</i>
<i>and forbidden things like boobs.</i>

19:58.500 --> 20:01.291

I'll never forget you, darling Kerstin.

20:01.375 --> 20:05.416
As more European films
were visible to the American audience,

20:05.500 --> 20:06.333
Hollywood realized,

20:06.416 --> 20:08.958
"If we're gonna compete,
we have to get rid of the Hays Code."

20:09.958 --> 20:13.083
[Lowe] <i>The solution was an age-based</i>
<i>film rating system,</i>

20:13.166 --> 20:15.250
<i>which put sex back on screen,</i>

20:15.333 --> 20:19.333
<i>much to the dismay of people aroused</i>
<i>by shots of trains entering tunnels.</i>

20:19.416 --> 20:21.625
Sex in films
is never really very convincing,

20:21.708 --> 20:25.625

it has its own stock set of clichés.

<i>Bras rarely ever fall off,</i>
<i>and you'll both finish at the same time.</i>

20:45.333 --> 20:46.458
<i>whatever the money.</i>

20:47.125 --> 20:50.958
It's that intensity, the build of music,
the build of passion.

20:51.041 --> 20:53.666
We all know what's gonna happen,
we don't need to see the next bit.

20:55.333 --> 20:59.208
[Lowe] <i>So movies are once again</i>

of the spit take in it.

21:29.291 --> 21:32.000

A spit take is something

43:05.250 --> 43:09.375
<i>But while Hollywood may try to highlight</i>
<i>the issues of LGBTQ characters,</i>

43:09.458 --> 43:12.166
<i>it does kind of seem</i>
<i>to kill them in the process.</i>

43:13.875 --> 43:18.166
At times when it's touching
on the actual misery

43:18.250 --> 43:23.875
or torture of gay people,
I think it's actually okay as a cliché.

43:25.416 --> 43:28.083
<i>So for instance, in</i> Brokeback Mountain,

43:28.166 --> 43:31.041
<i>it's not a love story,</i>
<i>it's about persecution</i>

43:31.125 --> 43:32.583
over many, many years.

43:32.666 --> 43:34.708
And so when that death finally occurs,

43:34.791 --> 43:37.625
it's actually logically
dictated by the film.

43:37.708 --> 43:39.333
[Lureen] <i>He was only 39 years old.</i>

43:39.416 --> 43:43.750
Well, award season does really love
a biopic about a dead gay person.

43:43.833 --> 43:46.625
<i>They love a film</i>
<i>where someone dies tragically.</i>

43:47.625 --> 43:51.250
Yeah, I can attest to that
because I played a gay character

43:51.333 --> 43:52.708
in <i>Can You Ever Forgive Me?</i>

43:52.791 --> 43:56.416
And the character I played,
Jack Hock, did die of AIDS.

43:56.500 --> 43:59.625
You did fuck your way
through Manhattan. I mean...

44:01.958 --> 44:03.458
I'd like that on my tombstone.

44:03.541 --> 44:05.500
So yes, that is obviously true.

44:07.625 --> 44:12.708
[Lowe] <i>In fact, around 40% of LGBTQ</i>
<i>characters nominated for an Oscar</i>

44:12.791 --> 44:14.833
<i>don't make it to the end credits.</i>

44:18.250 --> 44:23.458
A great way to put a character in peril
is to rely on the tech and the tech fails.

44:23.541 --> 44:26.833
<i>In </i>Mission Impossible,
<i>when he's climbing that building,</i>

44:26.916 --> 44:28.166
you're like, "Cool."

44:28.250 --> 44:29.416
But then you think,

44:29.500 --> 44:32.416
now you're on the outside,
and that tech fails...

44:33.458 --> 44:35.458
<i>And so now you immediately have drama.</i>

44:35.541 --> 44:39.583
[Lowe] <i>Who hasn't scaled a building</i>
<i>and forgotten to bring a glove charger?</i>

44:39.666 --> 44:42.666
<i>Though most big tech fails</i>
<i>are more down-to-earth.</i>

44:42.750 --> 44:44.416
[engine grinding]

44:44.500 --> 44:48.916
We've all gotten into a car
and turned that thing and it didn't start.

44:49.000 --> 44:51.000
[grinding continues]

44:52.875 --> 44:55.083
A few years ago,
everybody got a cell phone.

44:55.166 --> 44:58.375
This is my last communication--
Oh, the battery died.

44:58.458 --> 45:00.291
[cell phone battery beeping]

45:00.375 --> 45:04.291
The tech has to fail for the story
to be engaging and for us to be like,

45:04.375 --> 45:05.541
"What will they do next?"

45:08.666 --> 45:10.958
[Lowe]<i> Whether it be</i>
<i>cutting-edge climbing technology,</i>

45:11.041 --> 45:15.333
<i>a car, or a cell phone,</i>
<i>the tech fail always signals danger.</i>

45:16.083 --> 45:16.916
[screams]

45:20.333 --> 45:23.875
<i>Angry and seated at a desk?</i>
<i>Then do the angry desk sweep.</i>

45:23.958 --> 45:25.625
Shit!

45:26.208 --> 45:29.875
[Lowe] <i>Has a maverick cop foiled</i>
<i>your master plan for making billions?</i>

45:31.833 --> 45:35.458
<i>Are you a world renowned neurosurgeon</i>
<i>with busted hands?</i>

45:37.416 --> 45:40.708
<i>Or a high-flying military lawyer</i>
<i>up against a five-star general?</i>

45:40.791 --> 45:43.916
Thank you for playing
"Should we or should we not

45:44.000 --> 45:47.000
follow the advice
of the galactically stupid!"

45:47.083 --> 45:50.083
[Lowe] <i>But what the hell,</i>
<i>kick a chair while you're at it.</i>

45:51.333 --> 45:55.000
<i>Maverick cop Jake Gyllenhaal</i>
<i>has a real challenge with this desk.</i>

45:55.083 --> 45:57.458
<i>His stuff just doesn't go anywhere.</i>

45:59.000 --> 46:01.250
<i>No wonder the keyboard gets a beating.</i>

46:04.041 --> 46:07.458
Every hero needs a villain
to go up against.

46:07.541 --> 46:10.000
It's taken us a while
to get around to him,

46:10.083 --> 46:12.583
but he's been expecting you, Mr. Bond.

46:14.833 --> 46:16.541
<i>If your hero is good-looking,</i>

46:16.625 --> 46:20.083
<i>this means the clichéd bad guy</i>
<i>has to be the polar opposite,</i>

46:20.166 --> 46:23.666
<i>and the filmmakers usually</i>
<i>make it easy for us to spot who they are.</i>

46:23.750 --> 46:26.625
Allow me to introduce myself.

46:27.958 --> 46:31.166
I am Ernst Stavro Blofeld.

46:31.250 --> 46:35.125
We make them other than us.
We make them ugly, disfigured.

46:35.208 --> 46:38.833
Some scar to say that they're evil,
even if they're a lion.

46:38.916 --> 46:40.208
Murderer.

46:40.291 --> 46:43.333
You're telling a story,
you're telling the audience

46:43.416 --> 46:46.583
that your character has been
involved in nefarious activity

46:46.666 --> 46:49.541
<i>and probably physical violence</i>
<i>in the past.</i>

46:49.625 --> 46:53.625
--and fulfill your destiny.

46:53.708 --> 46:56.416
The disfigured villain goes way back.

46:56.500 --> 47:00.250
<i>Back to silent film.</i>
<i>You have, obviously, Lon Chaney</i>

47:00.333 --> 47:01.791
<i>in </i>Phantom of the Opera,

47:01.875 --> 47:05.083
with the hairpins
stretching his nostrils out.

47:06.458 --> 47:11.708
The problem with that sort of
characterization is the fact that then,

47:11.791 --> 47:14.125
in real life, it translates to people

47:14.208 --> 47:16.625
who have those physical disfigurements

47:16.708 --> 47:20.625
being seen by other people
as dangerous, as scary,

47:20.708 --> 47:22.125
as someone to shun.

47:22.208 --> 47:28.125
Certainly that equating of disfigurement
in some way turning you into a psychopath

47:28.208 --> 47:30.833
is incredibly insulting.

47:30.916 --> 47:33.541
A lot of villains
are more cultured than the hero.

47:33.625 --> 47:37.083
You know, you'll have villains
who talk about their love of Beethoven.

47:37.750 --> 47:38.916
You don't like Beethoven.

47:39.000 --> 47:40.833
[Mark] <i>Loving the finer things in life...</i>

47:40.916 --> 47:42.541
You don't know what you're missing.

47:42.625 --> 47:44.583
...gives a sense
that there is another side,

47:44.666 --> 47:49.041
another side to them, which enhances
the fact that they're, you know, evil.

47:49.125 --> 47:54.583
I ate his liver with some fava beans
and a nice Chianti.

47:57.208 --> 47:58.708
They're often British.

47:58.791 --> 48:01.708
That tends to be
a real subcategory of villains.

48:01.791 --> 48:04.916
In Hollywood, they thought
that an English accent

48:05.000 --> 48:07.083
was a shorthand for sophistication.

48:07.750 --> 48:11.291
Do you intend to cooperate with us?
I'd like a simple yes or no.

48:11.375 --> 48:16.333
If your baddie had an English accent,
then the hero was dealing with something

48:16.416 --> 48:18.041
that wasn't just plain brutish.

48:18.125 --> 48:20.208
There was something else behind it.

48:20.291 --> 48:23.291
Somehow casting an English actor,
because we're cheap,

48:23.375 --> 48:25.083
and you can say the dialogue,

48:25.166 --> 48:28.708
and you can say gibberish dialogue
with great conviction.

48:28.791 --> 48:33.625
History, tradition, culture,
are not concepts.

48:33.708 --> 48:37.000
These are trophies
I keep in my den as paperweights!

48:37.083 --> 48:41.916
The monologue is a cliché
because it's the stuff of drama.

48:42.000 --> 48:46.916
Everything that has transpired
has done so according to my design.

48:47.000 --> 48:50.791
It's the writer allowing the audience to
understand where this character comes from

48:50.875 --> 48:52.708
and why they're doing what they're doing.

48:52.791 --> 48:57.625
I had a villain's monologue
in the final sequence of <i>Logan.</i>

48:57.708 --> 49:01.083
I'm giving this verse
about why I've done what I've done

49:01.166 --> 49:02.708
and killed his family, all this.

49:02.791 --> 49:06.125
I realized we needn't stop perfecting
what we eat and drink.

49:06.208 --> 49:08.291
We use those products
to perfect ourselves.

49:08.375 --> 49:10.500
And halfway through my monologue...

49:11.875 --> 49:14.000
he kills me, deservedly.

49:14.833 --> 49:18.666
There comes a time when every movie
simply has to stop happening.

49:18.750 --> 49:21.125
And that time is known as the end.

49:21.208 --> 49:23.458
It's when all the narrative plates
you've been spinning

49:23.541 --> 49:26.916
have to suddenly weave together
in a better metaphor than this.

49:27.000 --> 49:29.833
It's time for
the movie's climactic endgame,

49:29.916 --> 49:33.333
<i>and there are only</i>
<i>so many forms that can take.</i>

49:35.375 --> 49:37.750
<i>The shower scene in Hitchcock's </i>Psycho

49:37.833 --> 49:41.916
<i>with Janet Leigh is seen</i> by many
<i>to be the inspiration</i> <i>for our next cliché.</i>

49:42.000 --> 49:43.958
<i>And for locks on bathroom doors.</i>

49:44.041 --> 49:48.833
Hitchcock popularized this notion
that it would be women going through

49:48.916 --> 49:53.125
these horrific circumstances,
and he set up this expectation

49:53.208 --> 49:56.500
<i>that women would play</i>
<i>a central role in thrillers.</i>

49:57.583 --> 50:00.250
[Lowe] <i>Eighteen years later,</i>
<i>Janet Leigh's daughter,</i>

50:00.333 --> 50:02.208
<i>Jamie Lee Curtis, played a role</i>

50:02.291 --> 50:06.500
<i>which made her an icon of the cliché</i>
<i>now known as the final girl.</i>

50:09.083 --> 50:13.250
The monster versus the final girl,
Jamie Lee Curtis in <i>Halloween,</i>

50:13.333 --> 50:15.708
symbolically stands as the first.

50:15.791 --> 50:17.916
She is the blueprint, the prototype.

50:18.000 --> 50:21.041
The final girl is the one girl
who doesn't have sex,

50:21.125 --> 50:23.333
who's more innocent than her friends.

50:23.416 --> 50:26.791
You must have a small fortune stashed
from babysitting so much.

50:26.875 --> 50:28.375
Guys think I'm too smart.

50:28.458 --> 50:29.916
Because she's not having sex,

50:30.000 --> 50:33.333
she's somehow miraculously
more observant than all of her friends

50:33.416 --> 50:35.125
and senses something wrong first.

50:35.208 --> 50:37.708
If you want
a really good final-girl movie,

50:37.791 --> 50:40.416
you need to take a group of friends...

50:40.500 --> 50:44.125
If you listen to the old timers in town,
they'll tell you he's still out there.

50:44.208 --> 50:48.083
They've all gone off
on a weekend party somewhere.

50:48.166 --> 50:51.041
You need to give them
a spurious reason to go off

50:51.125 --> 50:54.458
in different directions,
and get up to any kind of mischief.

50:54.541 --> 50:56.250
[suspenseful music playing]

50:56.333 --> 51:00.291
That's another cliché, another rule:
If you do the dirty deed,

51:00.375 --> 51:01.541
you're gonna die.

51:03.250 --> 51:05.916
One by one they are dispatched.

51:06.000 --> 51:08.125
[cackling]

51:09.583 --> 51:11.791
There's always a lull in these movies

51:11.875 --> 51:14.583
where everyone thinks
the killer might be dead.

51:16.416 --> 51:19.625
Then it all comes crashing down
and she has to prove herself again.

51:21.666 --> 51:25.458
But she survives and she becomes
the audience surrogate.

51:28.166 --> 51:29.875
[woman screaming]

51:31.583 --> 51:34.000
I think slasher films
and all their clichés

51:34.083 --> 51:39.625
would be completely dead right now
if there hadn't existed <i>Scream.</i>

51:39.708 --> 51:43.250
[Lowe] Scream <i>turned the cliché</i>
<i>on its blood-splattered head</i>

51:43.333 --> 51:47.541
<i>by dispatching assumed final girl</i>
<i>Drew Barrymore in its opening moments.</i>

51:49.291 --> 51:55.416
I think the <i>Scream</i> franchise
really addressed the horror fans

51:55.500 --> 52:00.875
and their knowledge of the clichés,
and sort of turned it on its head.

52:00.958 --> 52:02.500
What's the point? They're all the same.

52:02.583 --> 52:04.916
Some stupid killer
stalking some big-breasted girl

52:05.000 --> 52:07.833
who's running up the stairs when
she should be going out the door.

52:07.916 --> 52:08.750
It's insulting.

52:08.833 --> 52:11.666
[Lowe] <i>But the final girl</i>
<i>has appropriately survived.</i>

52:13.041 --> 52:14.875
<i>Today, she's better prepared.</i>

52:15.791 --> 52:17.083
Fuck your family.

52:17.166 --> 52:19.250
[Pugh] <i>We're now giving her power</i>
<i>towards the end,</i>

52:19.333 --> 52:21.750
and we're making people
scared of her towards the end.

52:21.833 --> 52:23.250
Eat it, bitch!

52:24.041 --> 52:27.166
She is sometimes more deadly
than the people

52:27.250 --> 52:29.958
that she's actually
kind of fighting to survive.

52:31.958 --> 52:34.625
And technically,
has a much bigger body count

52:34.708 --> 52:38.000
than any of the would-be "killers"
in the movie.

52:39.583 --> 52:43.333
I think it's kind of evolved
as a cliché now

52:43.416 --> 52:46.125
into almost
a kind of a comfort-food finale.

52:47.291 --> 52:48.125
Fuck.

52:49.375 --> 52:53.041
[Lowe] <i>Next up: that explosive</i>
<i>movie cliché, the ticking time bomb.</i>

52:53.666 --> 52:55.750
[Hargrave] <i>There's a bomb,</i>
<i>and there's a ticking clock.</i>

52:55.833 --> 52:58.208
If the hero doesn't act,
large amounts of people die.

52:58.291 --> 53:00.000
So inherently dramatic.

53:00.083 --> 53:02.958
-How much time left?
-Twenty seconds!

53:03.041 --> 53:06.833
[Edelstein] <i>Doesn't matter what movie,</i>
<i>when you watch the numbers click down,</i>

53:06.916 --> 53:08.583
your heart is in your mouth.

53:10.416 --> 53:14.083
[Lowe] <i>In its classic form,</i>
<i>this cliché always comes down to the wire.</i>

53:14.166 --> 53:15.166
You think?

53:15.250 --> 53:18.541
Cut the red or the blue,
the red or the blue?

53:18.625 --> 53:20.625
[suspenseful music playing]

53:24.250 --> 53:27.583
It's one of the great
non-action climaxes ever.

53:27.666 --> 53:28.833
They look sexier now.

53:28.916 --> 53:32.500
<i>Often it's someone trying to hack in</i>
<i>and stop the countdown.</i>

53:33.458 --> 53:35.541
[automated voice]
<i>Cerberus has been deactivated.</i>

53:35.625 --> 53:39.375
If it's your hero defusing the time bomb,
you know he or she is gonna do it.

53:39.458 --> 53:41.041
The fun thing for us is going,

53:41.125 --> 53:44.875
"How close to one
are they gonna take it, really?"

53:44.958 --> 53:48.500
<i>And it goes to one so many times.</i>

53:54.166 --> 53:57.750
[Lowe]<i> The must-have at the end</i>
<i>of a romance is the lover's mad dash</i>

53:57.833 --> 54:01.833
<i>where one of the pair has a frenzied race</i>
<i>against time and geography</i>

54:01.916 --> 54:04.541
<i>to declare undying love to their partner.</i>

54:04.625 --> 54:08.875
Often, that will involve
a last-minute lover's dash to the airport,

54:08.958 --> 54:10.833
<i>or to stop a wedding happening.</i>

54:10.916 --> 54:13.125
The Graduate's<i> a classic one of that.</i>

54:17.208 --> 54:19.541
Oh, Jesus, God, no.

54:20.208 --> 54:23.500
[Lowe] <i>Having chased and convinced</i>
<i>their other half of their eternal love,</i>

54:23.583 --> 54:27.666
<i>their reward is a passionate kiss,</i>
<i>usually in bad weather conditions.</i>

54:28.333 --> 54:32.541
[King] <i>It's when you're so wrapped up</i>
<i>in kissing the person you love</i>

54:32.625 --> 54:35.708
that you're not even aware
of the terrible weather.

54:35.791 --> 54:38.666
And I think that's what happened
in <i>Four Weddings and a Funeral,</i>

54:38.750 --> 54:41.708
was these two people
having all these obstacles

54:41.791 --> 54:46.708
not to be together,
and finally, in the rain...

54:49.000 --> 54:51.250
Is it still raining? I hadn't noticed.

54:55.375 --> 54:58.458
Greta Gerwig, the director,
did that for the end of <i>Little Women.</i>

55:02.708 --> 55:07.625
She wanted that end-of-the-movie shot,
and I remember chatting to her about this

55:07.708 --> 55:12.458
and she was like, "I want it, I want it,
I grew up watching it, and I want it."

55:12.541 --> 55:17.208
If things have gone right, at the end,
the audience is on the edge of their seat

55:17.291 --> 55:19.291
wondering whether the good guy will win,

55:19.375 --> 55:22.500
<i>while knowing, with every</i>
<i>fiber in their being, that he will.</i>

55:24.208 --> 55:27.833
Hey, why don't you pick on someone
your own size?

55:27.916 --> 55:31.291
The morality tale
demands that the hero kills the villain.

55:35.458 --> 55:37.041
<i>The better the death,</i>

55:37.583 --> 55:41.250
the more satisfying
the vanquishing of the villain is.

55:41.333 --> 55:44.833
Someone falling from a great height
has been a classic way

55:44.916 --> 55:46.541
to finish your story.

55:46.625 --> 55:49.166
<i>Brilliantly done in </i>Die Hard,<i> of course,</i>

55:49.250 --> 55:52.875
and it gives them a moment or two
to know that they're beaten.

55:56.875 --> 55:58.958
It's a very satisfying moment
for the audience.

55:59.041 --> 56:03.875
<i>It's to enable them to feel safe.</i>
<i>You vanquish the villain so you feel safe.</i>

56:04.708 --> 56:06.166
[screaming]

56:07.583 --> 56:10.666
[Garfield] <i>And the more dastardly</i>
<i>the behavior of the villain,</i>

56:10.750 --> 56:14.916
the more karmic justice
we are praying for.

56:15.000 --> 56:19.166
There's a blood lust that a great villain
creates in an audience.

56:19.250 --> 56:21.083
Yippee-ki-yay, motherfucker.

56:27.750 --> 56:31.958
At the end of a movie, we want
to have good overcome bad.

56:32.041 --> 56:36.041
That's what drives that desire
to watch a movie with great heroes.

56:36.125 --> 56:39.500
That everything's gonna be okay
and the world's not scary.

56:40.583 --> 56:43.541
[Lowe] <i>Until the contractually</i>
<i>binding sequel brings them back,</i>

56:43.625 --> 56:46.500
<i>the last few moments of the movie</i>
<i>are for the heroes to bask</i>

56:46.583 --> 56:49.875
<i>in their hard-earned glory</i>
<i>before riding off into the distance.</i>

56:52.250 --> 56:54.458
Well, as I said at the start,
I've been Rob Lowe,

56:54.541 --> 56:57.583
and that's it
for our look at Hollywood clichés.

56:57.666 --> 57:01.083
Nothing for me to do now except
jump on my horse and/or motorcycle

57:01.166 --> 57:04.708
and ride off into the sunset
while rock music and/or hip-hop kicks in.

57:05.375 --> 57:07.041
But that would ruin my suit.

57:07.125 --> 57:11.000
So let's just abruptly roll credits
when I snap my fingers.

57:11.666 --> 57:14.666
[electronic music playing]
