OH, AND IF YOU WANT

DON'T FORGET TO PUT
HIS LITTLE BEANIE HAT ON.

01:08.836 --> 01:10.304

- YEAH, WELL, YOU COULDN'T BE
MORE SURPRISED IF IT WAS.

08:54.868 --> 08:56.036
YOU GONNA LET ME IN?

08:56.069 --> 08:59.640
- UH, S-SURE.

08:59.673 --> 09:02.743
- HEY. SOME PLACE.

09:02.776 --> 09:05.579
[sighing]
BIG AS A PALACE.

09:05.613 --> 09:07.781
LOOKS LIKE A DUMP
FROM THE OUTSIDE.

09:07.815 --> 09:11.318
[Gus fussing]
HEY, WHO'S THIS?

09:11.351 --> 09:15.789
- UH, THIS IS GUS.
UH, HE'S...

09:15.823 --> 09:18.158
LINDSAY'S KID.
YOU REMEMBER LINDSAY?

09:18.191 --> 09:21.795
- AH. TALLISH, BLONDE?

09:21.829 --> 09:24.898
YOU USED TO TAKE HER OUT.

09:24.932 --> 09:26.900
SHE WAS A PRETTY GIRL.

09:26.934 --> 09:30.070
SHE'S GOT ONE HELL
OF A CUTE SON.

09:30.103 --> 09:32.372
SHE LEAVES HIM WITH YOU?

09:32.405 --> 09:35.042
- SOMETIMES.

09:35.075 --> 09:37.711
SO WHAT ARE YOU DOING,
WANDERING AROUND TOWN?

09:37.745 --> 09:40.280
A LADY-FRIEND?

09:40.313 --> 09:41.949
AREN'T YOU A LITTLE BIT OLD
FOR THAT?

09:41.982 --> 09:43.951
- THAT'S NOT IT.

09:43.984 --> 09:47.688
[sighs]

09:47.721 --> 09:49.056
- NEED MONEY?

09:49.089 --> 09:51.091
- NO, I DIDN'T COME
FOR YOUR FUCKING MONEY.

09:51.124 --> 09:52.993
- MOM FINALLY LEAVE YOU?

09:53.026 --> 09:56.196
- I'VE GOT CANCER.

09:56.229 --> 09:57.898
IT STARTED IN MY LUNGS,

09:57.931 --> 09:59.733
BUT IT'S ALREADY SPREAD.

09:59.767 --> 10:01.134
MY BRILLIANT...

10:01.168 --> 10:04.905
DOCTORS DISCOVERED IT
ON AN X-RAY DURING MY...

10:04.938 --> 10:07.374
PHYSICAL LAST SUMMER.

10:07.407 --> 10:10.844
NOW, SEEMS IT'S EVERYWHERE.

10:13.380 --> 10:14.948
- SORRY.

10:14.982 --> 10:17.718
- I WOULD RATHER
THE WARDEN DO THE HONORS,

10:17.751 --> 10:20.721
BUT SHE INSISTED I TELL YOU
AND YOUR SISTER IN PERSON.

10:20.754 --> 10:23.390
SO YOU'RE HEARING IT
FROM ME.

10:23.423 --> 10:24.391
- THANKS.

10:24.424 --> 10:25.826
- HELLO?

10:25.859 --> 10:28.696
SESAME NOODLE.
DIDN'T FORGET THIS TIME.

10:34.702 --> 10:37.004
- YOU KNOW, MICHAEL JUST MOVED
IN A FEW WEEKS AGO.

10:37.037 --> 10:40.273
THAT'S WHY, UH, THE FUNNY THINGS
THAT YOU SEE AROUND HERE,

10:40.307 --> 10:43.777
LIKE CAPTAIN ASTRO,
THAT'S, UH--

10:43.811 --> 10:47.380
THAT'S HIS.

10:47.414 --> 10:50.784
- MUST BE EVEN YOUNGER
THAN I THOUGHT.

10:50.818 --> 10:52.920
CISCO'S UP. COOL!

10:52.953 --> 10:54.287
- YOU READ THE STOCK PAGE?

10:54.321 --> 10:55.989
- DON'T YOU?

10:56.023 --> 10:58.726
- UH, I STICK TO SPORTS.

10:58.759 --> 11:00.794
CAPTAIN CRUNCH.
STILL YOUR FAVORITE?

11:00.828 --> 11:05.232
- ACTUALLY, I EAT NON-FAT,
SUGAR-FREE, ORGANIC MUESLIX.

11:05.265 --> 11:07.000
- WELL...

11:07.034 --> 11:10.103
THAT WOULD EXPLAIN
WHY YOU'VE GROWN SO MUCH.

11:10.137 --> 11:14.174
YOU'VE PROBABLY GROWN A FOOT
SINCE THE LAST TIME I SAW YOU.

11:14.207 --> 11:15.809
- I WEAR A SIZE SIX SHOE NOW.

11:15.843 --> 11:18.846
DAD BOUGHT ME
THESE AWESOME ADIDAS.

11:18.879 --> 11:21.114
I MEAN, GARY.

11:27.487 --> 11:29.757
- MAYBE I'LL BUY YOU
AN AWESOME PAIR OF PANTS

11:29.790 --> 11:32.459
TO GO WITH THOSE.

11:32.492 --> 11:34.995
- MORNING.
- MORNING.

11:35.028 --> 11:37.330
- HI, HANK.
HOW'D YOU SLEEP?

11:37.364 --> 11:40.067
- OKAY.

11:40.100 --> 11:45.305
HOW ABOUT YOU?

11:45.338 --> 11:47.808
- GET YOURSELF SOME BREAKFAST.
WE'RE LEAVING IN 20 MINUTES.

11:47.841 --> 11:49.376
- WHAT'S THE RUSH?
- WHAT'S THE RUSH?

11:49.409 --> 11:51.411
I DON'T WANT TO WASTE ANY TIME.
WE GOT A MILLION THINGS TO DO.

11:51.444 --> 11:53.847
I'LL GET MY WALLET,
YOU GUYS GET DRESSED.

12:02.022 --> 12:03.957
- SO YOU MUST BE HAPPY
TO SEE YOUR DAD, HUH?

12:05.292 --> 12:08.495
HE'S BEEN, UH, TALKING
ABOUT YOUR VISIT NON-STOP.

12:08.528 --> 12:09.963
HE'S REALLY EXCITED.

12:09.997 --> 12:11.398
- LOOK, I DIDN'T WANT
TO COME HERE OKAY?

12:11.431 --> 12:13.166
AT ALL!
MY MOM MADE ME.

12:13.200 --> 12:14.201
SO I'LL JUST HAVE
TO PUT UP WITH IT

12:14.234 --> 12:17.237
UNTIL I CAN GO HOME.

12:17.270 --> 12:19.006
- GUYS!
[clapping]

12:19.039 --> 12:20.307
COME ON, LET'S GO.
GET DRESSED.

12:20.340 --> 12:23.510
WE GOT A BIG DAY.
PITTSBURGH'S WAITING FOR US.

12:23.543 --> 12:25.478
- [sigh]

12:31.084 --> 12:32.853
- HOW DO YOU WANT
YOUR WAFFLES?

12:32.886 --> 12:35.455
IN PEACHES AND GRAND MARNIER,
OR CHERRIES AND RUM?

12:35.488 --> 12:37.991
- BETTER YET, WOLFGANG,
WHY DON'T YOU SKIP THE WAFFLES

12:38.025 --> 12:39.993
AND JUST SERVE THE SAUCE?

12:40.027 --> 12:41.228
STRAIGHT UP.

12:41.261 --> 12:44.397
- [groaning, sighing]

12:44.431 --> 12:46.533
GUS JUST PUKED...

12:46.566 --> 12:48.368
ALL OVER ME.

12:48.401 --> 12:50.403
- BABIES DO THAT.
- MMM.

12:50.437 --> 12:53.273
ALL OVER MY FAVORITE
LEATHER JACKET.

12:53.306 --> 12:56.243
- A FASHION CRITIC ALREADY.

12:56.276 --> 12:59.379
- LOOK WHO'S HERE!
[gasps]

12:59.412 --> 13:01.815
OH, CAN I HOLD HIM?

13:01.849 --> 13:03.083
- YEAH, BE MY GUEST.

13:03.116 --> 13:05.252
- OH, LOOK AT YOU.

13:05.285 --> 13:09.823
HUH? OH, LOOK AT YOU.
HOW ARE YOU, GORGEOUS GUS?

13:09.857 --> 13:11.424
COME HERE.
- HE'S ACES.

13:11.458 --> 13:13.894
BUT I SUSPECT HE MISSES
HIS MOTHER'S TOUCH.

13:13.927 --> 13:16.029
- AH, WELL, I'LL TAKE CARE
OF THAT.

13:16.063 --> 13:17.497
- YOU KNOW...
- HI, BABY.

13:17.530 --> 13:19.599
- IF YOU'D BE INTERESTED
IN SATISFYING

13:19.632 --> 13:22.903
YOUR MATERNAL URGES
FOR A LONGER PERIOD OF TIME,

13:22.936 --> 13:25.505
RECREATING THE AMBER HUES
OF MICHAEL'S CHILDHOOD

13:25.538 --> 13:29.176
FOR AN ENTIRE EVENING,
FOR INSTANCE...

13:29.209 --> 13:31.144
THAT COULD BE ARRANGED.

13:31.178 --> 13:34.447
- YOU WANT TO GO
TO THE LEATHER BALL, HUH?

13:34.481 --> 13:38.185
- HMM, YOU'RE GOOD.
- YEAH.

13:38.218 --> 13:40.620
BUT YOU'RE BARKING UP
THE WRONG BABYSITTER.

13:40.653 --> 13:44.291
'CAUSE I'VE GOT THE GRAVEYARD
SHIFT AT THE DINER, DON'T I?

13:47.494 --> 13:49.329
- I'LL BE BACK.

13:49.362 --> 13:52.199
- BE SURE AND WASH THEM DOWN
WITH BOTTLED WATER,

13:52.232 --> 13:54.935
NOT THAT SHIT
FROM THE SUSQUEHANNA.

13:54.968 --> 13:57.304
- YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.

13:57.337 --> 14:00.440
- YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.

14:00.473 --> 14:01.608
YEAH.

14:01.641 --> 14:03.911
- MUST BE TOUGH LIVING
WITH THAT.

14:13.086 --> 14:15.488
- BRIAN?

14:15.522 --> 14:18.491
HONEY--
YOU'RE NOT--

14:18.525 --> 14:22.195
- [scoffs] NO.

14:22.229 --> 14:26.066
BUT MY DAD'S...GOT CANCER.

14:26.099 --> 14:27.300
- YOUR DAD'S SICK?

14:27.334 --> 14:29.502
- HE CAME OVER LAST NIGHT...

14:29.536 --> 14:32.940
TO TELL ME THAT.

14:32.973 --> 14:36.309
- I'M SO SORRY.

14:36.343 --> 14:37.978
HOW LONG'S HE GOT?

14:38.011 --> 14:41.048
- COUPLE MONTHS, TOPS.

14:46.219 --> 14:49.356
- WELL, THEN...

14:49.389 --> 14:51.258
IF YOU DON'T MIND
SOME FREE ADVICE

14:51.291 --> 14:53.160
FROM SOMEONE WHO'S KNOWN YOU
A LOT LONGER

14:53.193 --> 14:54.361
THAN YOU'VE KNOWN YOURSELF,

14:54.394 --> 14:56.096
YOU SHOULD TELL HIM.

14:56.129 --> 14:58.398
- TELL HIM WHAT?

14:58.431 --> 15:01.434
- YOU KNOW DAMN WELL,
DON'T PLAY DUMB.

15:01.468 --> 15:02.569
HE MADE A VERY BIG GESTURE

15:02.602 --> 15:04.071
IN TELLING YOU
ABOUT HIMSELF.

15:04.104 --> 15:06.273
I'M SAYING
YOU SHOULD RETURN THE FAVOR.

15:06.306 --> 15:08.408
- NO FUCKING WAY.

15:08.441 --> 15:11.411
MY FATHER HASN'T KNOWN ANYTHING
ABOUT MY LIFE FOR 29 YEARS,

15:11.444 --> 15:13.313
OR CARED.

15:13.346 --> 15:15.915
WHY SHOULD I BOTHER NOW?

15:21.588 --> 15:23.290
- BECAUSE IT'S GOOD FOR YOU.

15:23.323 --> 15:25.292
- TO TELL A DYING MAN
I'M QUEER?

15:25.325 --> 15:26.593
- TO BE HONEST.

15:26.626 --> 15:28.095
- I'M ALWAYS HONEST.

15:28.128 --> 15:29.529
- YOU THINK YOU ARE.

15:29.562 --> 15:30.663
HOW HONEST IS IT

15:30.697 --> 15:32.332
TO LET YOUR FATHER GO
TO HIS GRAVE

15:32.365 --> 15:35.102
WITHOUT EVER REALLY KNOWING
WHO HIS SON IS, HONEY?

15:39.306 --> 15:42.675
LOOK, I KNOW YOU THINK
HE NEVER LOVED YOU.

15:42.709 --> 15:45.278
BUT IT MIGHT BE A WAY
TO GET THROUGH TO HIM.

15:45.312 --> 15:49.616
FOR WHATEVER IT'S WORTH,
BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE.

15:53.453 --> 15:55.688
- IF I WANTED A THERAPIST,

15:55.722 --> 15:59.192
I'D LOOK
IN THE FUCKING YELLOW PAGES.

15:59.226 --> 16:01.061
- YEAH, BUT I'M A HELL
OF A LOT CHEAPER,

16:01.094 --> 16:04.364
AND I DON'T TAKE OFF AUGUST.

16:04.397 --> 16:06.566
- I-I BET HE'S HUNGRY.

16:06.599 --> 16:09.069
CAN I FEED HIM?

16:11.704 --> 16:15.275
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING TONIGHT?

16:15.308 --> 16:17.610
- HA! ISN'T THAT
AQUARIUM INCREDIBLE?

16:17.644 --> 16:19.446
I MEAN, I COULD STARE
AT THOSE FISH TANKS FOREVER.

16:19.479 --> 16:20.780
- IT JUST SEEMED THAT LONG.

16:20.813 --> 16:22.382
ACTUALLY, IT WAS JUST
UNDER FIVE HOURS.

16:22.415 --> 16:24.117
- THIS IS SO GREAT.

16:24.151 --> 16:25.752
I MEAN, I LOVE BEING TOGETHER,
YOU KNOW, SHARING THIS,

16:25.785 --> 16:27.320
JUST YOU AND ME
AND MICHAEL.

16:27.354 --> 16:30.090
- YEAH. GREAT.
- AH.

16:30.123 --> 16:32.159
- CAN WE TAKE A BREAK
FOR LUNCH SOON?

16:32.192 --> 16:34.294
UM, LOOKING AT ALL THOSE FISH
MADE ME HUNGRY FOR CHICKEN.

16:34.327 --> 16:35.795
- ARE YOU KIDDING ME?
WE'VE GOT TO GET TO THE MUSEUM.

16:35.828 --> 16:37.364
THERE'S A DINOSAUR EXHIBIT.

16:37.397 --> 16:38.665
- AH, I HAVEN'T BEEN
INTO DINOSAURS

16:38.698 --> 16:40.667
SINCE, LIKE, THIRD GRADE.

16:40.700 --> 16:42.102
- HA! I LOVE DINOSAURS.

16:42.135 --> 16:43.236
IT'S NICE TO KNOW
THERE'S A CREATURE

16:43.270 --> 16:44.771
ACTUALLY OLDER THAN ME.
[laughing]

16:44.804 --> 16:46.639
ANYWAY, AFTER THAT,
WE CAN GO TO THE DRIVING RANGE.

16:46.673 --> 16:48.641
NO, THE--NO, THE BATTING CAGE
'CAUSE YOUR MOTHER TELLS ME

16:48.675 --> 16:49.709
YOUR SWING'S
REALLY COMING ALONG.

16:49.742 --> 16:51.644
AND THERE'S THIS ARCADE
THAT I WANT TO CHECK OUT.

16:51.678 --> 16:53.113
I-I HEAR
IT'S REALLY FANTASTIC.

16:53.146 --> 16:55.115
I GUESS WE'LL--
WE'LL FIND OUT.

16:55.148 --> 16:58.551
[continued chatting]

16:58.585 --> 17:01.654
[techno music]

17:01.688 --> 17:09.629
*

17:11.298 --> 17:12.665
- I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU
ACTUALLY WENT OUT IN PUBLIC

17:12.699 --> 17:15.235
DRESSED LIKE THAT.

17:15.268 --> 17:17.104
- MY MOTHER USED TO SAY,

17:17.137 --> 17:18.338
"FIND YOUR BEST FEATURE

17:18.371 --> 17:20.573
AND PLAY IT
FOR ALL IT'S WORTH."

17:20.607 --> 17:23.443
SO THAT'S EXACTLY
WHAT I DID.

17:23.476 --> 17:25.378
BESIDES, IT'S CALLED
THE LEATHER BALL.

17:25.412 --> 17:28.081
YOU COULD HAVE AT LEAST DRESSED
FOR THE OCCASION.

17:28.115 --> 17:30.250
- I DID.
I WORE A LEATHER BELT.

17:30.283 --> 17:33.186
- YOU ARE SUCH A STICK
IN THE MUD.

17:33.220 --> 17:35.755
- WHY? BECAUSE I-I DON'T WANT
TO LOOK LIKE A CROSS

17:35.788 --> 17:39.392
BETWEEN A NAZI STORM TROOPER
AND...ROY ROGERS?

17:39.426 --> 17:41.728
- MM, STOP IT,
YOU'RE GIVING ME A HARD-ON.

17:45.732 --> 17:48.601
I HOPE HE'S HOUSEBROKEN.

17:48.635 --> 17:52.339
- HONESTLY, THESE PEOPLE
ARE TOO WEIRD.

17:54.674 --> 17:56.876
- HELLO, PIG BOTTOM.
[laughing]

17:56.909 --> 17:58.678
HOW WOULD YOU LIKE
TO POLISH MY BOOT

17:58.711 --> 18:00.180
WITH YOUR TONGUE?

18:00.213 --> 18:02.449
- MMM.
LIKE I SAID.

18:02.482 --> 18:05.418
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
I THOUGHT YOU HAD GUS.

18:05.452 --> 18:06.653
- I FOUND A SITTER.

18:06.686 --> 18:08.521
- ENJOY, YOU GUYS.

18:08.555 --> 18:09.889
- WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

18:09.922 --> 18:11.591
- HOME.

18:11.624 --> 18:13.860
TO MY LEATHER RECLINER.

18:13.893 --> 18:17.430
THAT'S ABOUT AS KINKY
AS I GET.

18:17.464 --> 18:22.735
[cheers and applause]

18:22.769 --> 18:25.505
- LET'S GO!

18:25.538 --> 18:29.342
[gasps of pain]

18:57.837 --> 19:00.707
[cheers and applause]

19:08.615 --> 19:11.384
- OH, MY GOD,
ISN'T THAT--

19:11.418 --> 19:12.919
- DALE WEXLER?

19:12.952 --> 19:18.291
- WELL, NOW YOU KNOW ONE
OF HIS SECRETS, DON'T YOU?

19:18.325 --> 19:21.194
- THAT WAS QUITE A DAY, HUH?
- NO SHIT.

19:21.228 --> 19:23.196
I SAW MORE OF PITTSBURGH
IN 12 HOURS

19:23.230 --> 19:24.231
THAN I'VE SEEN
IN MY ENTIRE LIFE.

19:24.264 --> 19:25.598
- [chuckling]

19:25.632 --> 19:27.667
YOU KNOW, EVERY TIME I SEE HIM,
HE'S DIFFERENT.

19:27.700 --> 19:30.270
AND I HAVE TO SPEND THE COUPLE
OF DAYS THAT WE HAVE TOGETHER

19:30.303 --> 19:31.571
TRYING TO GET TO KNOW
THE "NEW HANK"

19:31.604 --> 19:36.876
BEFORE HE'S GONE AGAIN.

19:36.909 --> 19:40.280
MICHAEL?
- HUH?

19:40.313 --> 19:41.914
- AREN'T YOU SUPPOSED
TO TAKE OFF YOUR CLOTHES

19:41.948 --> 19:43.950
BEFORE YOU COME TO BED?

19:43.983 --> 19:46.353
- DON'T FLIP OUT, UM,
BUT I...

19:46.386 --> 19:49.456
I THINK I SHOULD GO STAY
AT MY OLD PLACE TONIGHT.

19:49.489 --> 19:51.658
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT,
WHAT FOR?

19:51.691 --> 19:54.927
- I THINK HANK'S UNCOMFORTABLE
WITH ME HERE.

19:54.961 --> 19:57.297
- WHERE DID YOU GET THAT IDEA?
DID HE TELL YOU THAT?

19:57.330 --> 19:58.931
- WELL, NOT IN SO MANY WORDS.

19:58.965 --> 20:00.933
BUT, YOU KNOW, THE SILENCES

20:00.967 --> 20:03.570
TOLD ME EVERYTHING
I NEEDED TO KNOW.

20:03.603 --> 20:04.771
- WELL...

20:04.804 --> 20:06.439
YOU GOT TO GIVE HIM
SOME TIME, YOU KNOW,

20:06.473 --> 20:07.940
TO GET TO KNOW YOU.

20:07.974 --> 20:09.442
- I DON'T THINK HE WANTS
TO GET TO KNOW ME, YOU KNOW.

20:09.476 --> 20:10.710
AND I DON'T BLAME HIM.

20:10.743 --> 20:12.812
THIS WHOLE
"HANK HAS TWO DADDIES" THING

20:12.845 --> 20:15.615
IS TOO MUCH FOR ANY KID.

20:15.648 --> 20:17.317
- HE HAD NO PROBLEM
WHEN I WAS WITH MACK.

20:17.350 --> 20:19.018
- WELL, NO OFFENSE,
BUT YOU KNOW,

20:19.051 --> 20:21.020
HANK WAS A LOT YOUNGER THEN,
YOU KNOW.

20:21.053 --> 20:22.389
NOW, HE'S OLDER,

20:22.422 --> 20:24.491
AND HE'S STARTING
TO DEFINE HIS SEXUALITY,

20:24.524 --> 20:26.693
I'M SURE IT'S PRETTY UNSETTLING
TO SEE HIS DAD

20:26.726 --> 20:29.796
AND HIS NEW MALE LOVER.

20:29.829 --> 20:31.531
- THE ONLY WAY HE'S GOING
TO GET USED TO US

20:31.564 --> 20:33.032
IS BY HAVING YOU AROUND.

20:33.065 --> 20:36.035
- WELL, CAN'T WE--
CAN'T WE EASE HIM INTO IT?

20:36.068 --> 20:37.937
YOU KNOW, START OUT
WITH A GUEST APPEARANCE

20:37.970 --> 20:40.373
AND THEN BUILD ME UP
TO A CO-STARRING ROLE?

20:40.407 --> 20:42.342
- YOU'RE NOT GOING ANYWHERE.

20:42.375 --> 20:43.876
- IT'LL ONLY BE
FOR A COUPLE OF NIGHTS.

20:43.910 --> 20:46.779
- NO, NOT EVEN FOR ONE NIGHT.

20:52.752 --> 20:54.921
HANK'S GOING TO BE FINE.

20:54.954 --> 20:57.590
AND SO ARE WE.

20:57.624 --> 20:59.659
NOW...

20:59.692 --> 21:01.794
LET'S GET YOU OUT OF THESE...
[unzipping fly]

21:01.828 --> 21:04.030
AND INTO BED.

21:09.536 --> 21:11.504
[chuckling]

21:11.538 --> 21:13.773
I THOUGHT THOSE MIGHT MAKE
AN APPEARANCE.

21:13.806 --> 21:15.508
[laughing]

21:29.556 --> 21:30.957
- TED?

21:30.990 --> 21:33.092
- HEY, DALE!
- I THOUGHT THAT WAS YOU.

21:33.125 --> 21:35.027
THEN I SAID TO MYSELF,
"WAIT A MINUTE, IT CAN'T BE.

21:35.061 --> 21:38.064
NOT, UH, TED SCHMIDT."

21:38.097 --> 21:39.799
WELL, THIS IS A SURPRISE.

21:39.832 --> 21:43.636
SO, YOU, A DADDY, A MASTER...
SLAVE?

21:43.670 --> 21:44.837
- ACTUALLY, NONE OF THE ABOVE.

21:44.871 --> 21:45.972
I--I'M HERE
JUST AS AN OBSERVER.

21:46.005 --> 21:47.607
[uneasy chuckle]

21:47.640 --> 21:48.908
- YEAH, THAT'S WHAT
THEY ALL SAY.

21:48.941 --> 21:50.843
NEXT THING YOU KNOW,
THERE THEY ARE IN A SLING,

21:50.877 --> 21:52.845
WITH A BOTTLE OF POPPERS
STUCK UP THEIR NOSE

21:52.879 --> 21:54.414
AND FIVE GUYS FISTING THEM.

21:54.447 --> 21:55.815
- [gasped chuckle]

21:55.848 --> 21:57.784
I GUARANTEE YOU,
THAT'S NOT THE CASE WITH ME.

21:57.817 --> 22:00.086
A-A FRIEND DRAGGED ME HERE.

22:00.119 --> 22:02.589
- UM, COWBOY BOB LASSOED ME.
[giggle]

22:02.622 --> 22:04.424
HE'S PROMISED TO TAKE ME OUT
TO THE STABLE,

22:04.457 --> 22:06.426
TIE ME UP LIKE
A SQUEALING PIG, AND BRAND ME.

22:06.459 --> 22:07.960
[titter]
YEE-HAW!

22:07.994 --> 22:10.563
- YOU'D BETTER GIT-ALONG,
LITTLE DOGGIE!

22:10.597 --> 22:12.965
UH...THAT'S MY FRIEND WHO...

22:12.999 --> 22:14.534
WHO DRAGGED ME HERE.

22:14.567 --> 22:17.737
- NOW HE'S BEING DRAGGED AWAY.
LUCKY HIM.

22:21.808 --> 22:24.143
- YEAH, WELL, UH, LOOK, I'M SURE
YOU MUST HAVE ANOTHER SLAVE

22:24.176 --> 22:26.579
YOU'VE GOT TO...WORK OVER,

22:26.613 --> 22:27.714
WHATEVER IT IS YOU DO,

22:27.747 --> 22:29.449
SO DON'T--DON'T LET ME
KEEP YOU.

22:29.482 --> 22:31.718
- THAT WAS JUST A MATINEE.

22:31.751 --> 22:32.852
STICK AROUND.

22:32.885 --> 22:34.787
THE NEXT ONE'S GOING
TO BE REALLY HOT.

22:34.821 --> 22:35.888
- OH.

22:35.922 --> 22:37.857
I, UH--ACTUALLY,
I WAS ON MY WAY HOME.

22:37.890 --> 22:39.659
- AFTERWARDS,
HOW ABOUT, UH...

22:39.692 --> 22:40.860
COMING OVER TO MY PLACE
FOR A DRINK?

22:40.893 --> 22:42.429
WE CAN CATCH UP.

22:42.462 --> 22:44.664
- ACTUALLY, IT'S PRETTY LATE,
YOU KNOW.

22:44.697 --> 22:47.400
- STRICTLY AS AN OBSERVER.

22:50.169 --> 22:52.939
SHOWTIME.

23:07.520 --> 23:12.692
[panting]

23:12.725 --> 23:15.462
[moans of pleasure]

23:35.181 --> 23:36.883
- HEY, LITTLE BOY,

23:36.916 --> 23:38.851
YOU WANNA COME BACK
TO MY PLACE?

23:38.885 --> 23:41.020
- NO.

23:41.053 --> 23:43.923
FUCK YOU.
- YOU'D LIKE THAT, WOULDN'T YOU?

23:43.956 --> 23:46.726
I CAN TELL YOU NEED A DADDY.

23:46.759 --> 23:50.062
- I SAID, "FUCK YOU."

23:50.096 --> 23:54.834
YOU'RE NOT MY DADDY.

23:54.867 --> 23:56.969
I DON'T NEED A FUCKING...

23:57.003 --> 24:00.907
DADDY.

24:07.113 --> 24:11.784
- I'VE BEEN "MR. LEATHER"
FOR THE PAST THREE YEARS.

24:11.818 --> 24:16.856
I'VE HELD, UH, BOTH REGIONAL
AND NATIONAL TITLES.

24:16.889 --> 24:21.928
- I'M, UH...IMPRESSED.

24:21.961 --> 24:25.998
AND SURPRISED.

24:26.032 --> 24:30.837
- SURPRISED?

24:30.870 --> 24:33.205
- WHO WOULD'VE SUSPECTED?

24:33.239 --> 24:35.241
ESPECIALLY CONSIDERING
YOUR OTHER LIFE.

24:35.274 --> 24:38.277
- THE ONE WHERE I WEAR A SUIT
AND CRUNCH NUMBERS

24:38.310 --> 24:42.114
AND TREAT THE CLIENTS
WITH UNDESERVED RESPECT?

24:42.148 --> 24:45.518
THAT'S NOT WHO I REALLY AM.

24:45.552 --> 24:46.819
- AND THIS IS?

24:46.853 --> 24:49.789
- IT'S AMAZING, TED...

24:49.822 --> 24:54.026
HOW IT'S ALLOWED ME
TO EXPAND MY HORIZONS.

24:55.895 --> 24:57.930
IN OTHER AREAS TOO,
EVEN IN BUSINESS.

24:57.964 --> 25:00.099
- SO, UH...

25:00.132 --> 25:03.002
BEING A LEATHER DADDY
IS THE KEY TO YOUR SUCCESS?

25:03.035 --> 25:04.837
- OH, YOU HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT CAN HAPPEN

25:04.871 --> 25:09.642
ONCE YOU GIVE YOURSELF
PERMISSION.

25:09.676 --> 25:11.811
- PERMISSION--UH, W-W-WHAT,
T-T-TO CHAIN PEOPLE UP,

25:11.844 --> 25:12.845
TIE PEOPLE DOWN?

25:12.879 --> 25:14.113
[nervous chuckle]

25:14.146 --> 25:17.717
- THAT CAN BE THE MOST
LIBERATING PART OF ALL--

25:17.750 --> 25:19.886
RELINQUISHING CONTROL,

25:19.919 --> 25:22.288
ALLOWING SOMEONE ELSE
TO GIVE YOU...

25:22.321 --> 25:24.557
PAIN, PLEASURE.

25:24.591 --> 25:29.161
WHATEVER YOU MOST FEAR
AND DESIRE.

25:29.195 --> 25:31.998
- [stammering]

25:32.031 --> 25:33.600
[stammering]
WOULD YOU--

25:33.633 --> 25:35.635
WOULD YOU MIND
IF I USE YOUR BATHROOM?

25:35.668 --> 25:38.070
- IT'S RIGHT DOWNSTAIRS.

26:28.387 --> 26:30.089
I SEE YOU FOUND MY PLAYROOM.

26:30.122 --> 26:31.691
- I'M SORRY, I JUST OPENED
THE WRONG DOOR.

26:31.724 --> 26:33.392
- OR NOT.

26:33.425 --> 26:37.396
SO WHAT DO YOU THINK?
- UH, WELL, I...

26:37.429 --> 26:41.133
GUESS YOU GAVE YOUR DECORATOR
FULL REIN.

26:41.167 --> 26:43.169
- WOULD YOU LIKE ME TO GIVE YOU
A LITTLE DEMONSTRATION?

26:43.202 --> 26:45.171
- OH, THAT'S OKAY, ACTUALLY,
I JUST, UH...

26:45.204 --> 26:47.173
I JUST, UH,
WANTED TO WASH MY HANDS.

26:47.206 --> 26:48.407
- WE'D BOTH ENJOY IT.

26:48.440 --> 26:50.843
ALWAYS THOUGHT
YOU WERE HOT.

26:50.877 --> 26:52.144
- YOU DID?

26:52.178 --> 26:55.147
- VANILLA BOYS ARE
ALWAYS THE WILDEST.

26:55.181 --> 26:57.850
ALL THAT UNFULFILLED DESIRE.

27:03.956 --> 27:07.860
WHY DON'T YOU ALLOW ME
TO INTRODUCE YOU TO YOURSELF?

27:07.894 --> 27:10.262
TO THE REAL TED SCHMIDT?

27:10.296 --> 27:14.166
I PROMISE I WON'T DO ANYTHING
YOU DON'T WANT ME TO.

27:18.304 --> 27:22.008
YOU SAY "STOP,"
AND I'LL STOP.

27:22.041 --> 27:23.009
- STOP!

27:23.042 --> 27:24.911
[clatter of metal objects]

27:24.944 --> 27:26.312
[stammering]

27:26.345 --> 27:29.115
I'M SOR--I DIDN'T--
I DIDN'T COME HERE FOR THIS.

27:29.148 --> 27:32.151
- I KNOW.
YOU'RE JUST AN OBSERVER.

27:32.184 --> 27:34.721
- THAT'S RIGHT,
AND I THINK I'VE SEEN ENOUGH.

27:34.754 --> 27:37.890
SO...
IF YOU'LL JUST EXCUSE ME.

27:45.732 --> 27:48.367
- YOU KNOW WHAT I REMEMBER
ABOUT YOU MOST?

27:48.400 --> 27:50.069
EVERY DAY IN THE SCHOOL
CAFETERIA,

27:50.102 --> 27:52.204
YOU'D HAVE THE SAME THING
FOR LUNCH.

27:52.238 --> 27:53.940
SO RELIABLE.

27:53.973 --> 27:57.209
I USED TO MARVEL
HOW THE MENU NEVER CHANGED.

27:57.243 --> 28:02.381
I GUESS NEITHER HAVE YOU.

28:02.414 --> 28:05.317
- THANK YOU FOR THE...

28:05.351 --> 28:07.286
DRINK.

28:10.823 --> 28:14.026
- MEL, I HAD NO IDEA.

28:14.060 --> 28:15.862
- HE WAS GOING TO GIVE
THE BABY HOT MILK.

28:15.895 --> 28:18.064
HE DIDN'T TEST IT ON HIS ARM.
- I DIDN'T KNOW.

28:18.097 --> 28:19.298
- THANK GOD I WALKED IN
WHEN I DID.

28:19.331 --> 28:21.067
GUS COULD'VE BEEN SCALDED.
- I'M SORRY.

28:21.100 --> 28:22.468
I'M SO SORRY.

28:22.501 --> 28:23.836
- WHAT THE FUCK
ARE YOU DOING HERE?

28:23.870 --> 28:25.471
- I CAME BACK FROM MIAMI EARLY

28:25.504 --> 28:27.339
AND THERE'S A MESSAGE
ON MY VOICE MAIL FROM LINDSAY

28:27.373 --> 28:29.475
SAYING THAT SHE LEFT GUS HERE
WITH YOU.

28:29.508 --> 28:31.077
SO I CAME BY TO CHECK ON HIM,

28:31.110 --> 28:33.112
AND IT'S A GOOD
GODDAMN THING I DID.

28:33.145 --> 28:34.881
PAWNING HIM OFF ON ANYONE

28:34.914 --> 28:37.083
SO YOU CAN GO
TO A FUCKING LEATHER BALL?

28:37.116 --> 28:39.251
- HEY, JUSTIN'S NOT "ANYONE."
- I LOVE GUS.

28:39.285 --> 28:42.789
- BABY, I KNOW YOU DO, HONEY.
THIS ISN'T ABOUT YOU.

28:42.822 --> 28:44.323
YOU TAKE HIM.

28:44.356 --> 28:45.858
THIS IS ABOUT YOU

28:45.892 --> 28:49.361
AND WHAT AN IRRESPONSIBLE SHIT
YOU ARE.

28:49.395 --> 28:52.464
- LISTEN, I WENT OUT
FOR A COUPLE OF HOURS.

28:52.498 --> 28:54.233
- YEAH, WELL, YOU SHOULDN'T
HAVE BEEN OUT AT ALL.

28:54.266 --> 28:55.968
BECAUSE, YOU SEE, THE THING
ABOUT PARENTHOOD IS,

28:56.002 --> 28:57.970
YOU DON'T GET ANONYMOUS
SEX BREAKS TWICE A DAY.

28:58.004 --> 29:00.339
NOW GIVE ME YOUR CAR KEYS.

29:00.372 --> 29:02.108
- UH, EXCUSE ME?

29:02.141 --> 29:03.375
- I SAID GIVE ME YOUR CAR KEYS

29:03.409 --> 29:07.079
SO I CAN GO GET THE BABY SEAT
OUT OF THE BACK OF YOUR JEEP.

29:07.113 --> 29:09.381
I'M TAKING GUS HOME.

29:09.415 --> 29:12.551
- NO, YOU'RE NOT.

29:12.584 --> 29:14.286
THIS IS HIS HOME.

29:14.320 --> 29:16.956
AT LEAST FOR THIS WEEKEND.

29:16.989 --> 29:19.225
- SORRY, YOUR PRIVILEGES
HAVE BEEN REVOKED.

29:19.258 --> 29:22.862
- DON'T FUCKING TELL ME
WHAT MY PRIVILEGES ARE.

29:22.895 --> 29:27.166
I'M HIS FATHER.
WHO ARE YOU?

29:33.272 --> 29:35.908
- I MAY BE NO ONE,

29:35.942 --> 29:37.109
BUT AT LEAST I LOVE HIM ENOUGH

29:37.143 --> 29:40.546
TO KNOW THAT HIS NEEDS COME
BEFORE MINE.

29:40.579 --> 29:45.918
WHICH IS MORE THAN
CAN BE SAID FOR YOU.

29:45.952 --> 29:48.955
- YEAH, GO, GO, GO,
GO, GO, GO!

29:48.988 --> 29:51.824
- HANK!

29:51.858 --> 29:52.925
YES!

29:52.959 --> 29:54.360
- DADDY, LOOK AT ME.
LOOK AT ME.

29:54.393 --> 29:56.128
- CAREFUL, HONEY.

29:56.162 --> 29:59.165
- YES!

29:59.198 --> 30:00.833
[chuckling]

30:00.867 --> 30:03.435
HANK SCORED THE WINNING GOAL
IN THE CHAMPIONSHIP LAST YEAR.

30:03.469 --> 30:05.271
- OF COURSE HE DID.

30:05.304 --> 30:07.139
- HOW COME YOU'RE SITTING
ON THE SIDELINES?

30:07.173 --> 30:08.908
- I TOLD YOU, I CAN'T SKATE.

30:08.941 --> 30:12.845
- WELL, I'LL HELP YOU.

30:12.879 --> 30:14.413
- IF GOD WANTED ME
TO BE ON ICE

30:14.446 --> 30:16.148
HE'D HAVE MADE ME
A VODKA MARTINI.

30:16.182 --> 30:17.316
- [laughing]

30:17.349 --> 30:19.185
- WHICH I COULD USE
RIGHT ABOUT NOW.

30:19.218 --> 30:21.620
WHAT IS THIS, "FAGS ON ICE"?

30:21.653 --> 30:26.158
- THAT'S THE OLYMPIC
FIGURE-SKATING TEAM.

30:26.192 --> 30:27.326
OKAY.

30:27.359 --> 30:29.595
[cell phone beeping]
AH, THAT'S ME.

30:29.628 --> 30:33.632
HANK, WILL YOU HELP ME
WITH MICHAEL, PLEASE?

30:33.665 --> 30:36.102
DR. CAMERON.

30:36.135 --> 30:37.469
YES.

30:37.503 --> 30:39.405
OH, YOU'RE KIDDING!

30:39.438 --> 30:40.907
UH-HUH.

30:40.940 --> 30:44.076
YEAH, I COULD BE THERE
IN ABOUT HALF AN HOUR.

30:44.110 --> 30:45.611
OKAY.

30:45.644 --> 30:49.181
ONE OF THE PENGUINS THREW
HIS BACK OUT DURING PRACTICE.

30:49.215 --> 30:50.449
I'M SORRY, CHAMP,
I'VE GOT TO GO.

30:50.482 --> 30:51.450
I WON'T BE VERY LONG.

30:51.483 --> 30:54.020
- NO BIGGIE.

30:56.522 --> 30:57.990
- WELL, IT'S A BIGGIE TO ME.

30:58.024 --> 30:59.325
YOU'RE LEAVING ME ALONE
WITH HIM?

30:59.358 --> 31:01.027
- WELL, I'M NOT GOING
TO BE VERY LONG.

31:01.060 --> 31:02.494
- WE DON'T KNOW EACH OTHER
VERY WELL.

31:02.528 --> 31:04.430
- WELL, YOU'LL GET TO.

31:04.463 --> 31:06.332
- BUT...
DAVID, YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.

31:06.365 --> 31:10.102
- I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT,
MICHAEL?

31:10.136 --> 31:13.372
- WELL, HE WAS LOOKING FORWARD
TO BEING WITH YOU.

31:13.405 --> 31:15.374
- I'M NOT GOING TO BE GONE
FOR VERY LONG.

31:15.407 --> 31:17.977
LOOK.

31:18.010 --> 31:19.045
HERE'S THE ITINERARY.

31:19.078 --> 31:21.313
YOU STICK TO THAT,
YOU'LL HAVE A GREAT TIME, OKAY?

31:21.347 --> 31:23.115
I'LL SEE YOU
IN A LITTLE WHILE.

31:33.625 --> 31:34.660
- HI, HONEY.
- DEB.

31:34.693 --> 31:36.228
- HI, BABY.

31:36.262 --> 31:40.266
HEY! HOW'D IT GO LAST NIGHT,
"DADDY"?

31:40.299 --> 31:42.601
- WOULD YOU MIND NOT USING
THAT WORD IN MY PRESENCE?

31:42.634 --> 31:44.470
- OOH, GROUCHY, HUH?

31:44.503 --> 31:47.006
THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS
WHEN YOU TEND TO A TOT, SEE?

31:47.039 --> 31:49.008
IT'S NOT A PRETTY JOB.

31:49.041 --> 31:50.276
BUT I'M PROUD OF YOU, BRIAN.

31:50.309 --> 31:52.544
HUH?
SACRIFICING THE LEATHER BALL.

31:52.578 --> 31:53.679
WHOO! THAT'S BIG.

31:53.712 --> 31:56.415
- ALTRUISM'S HIS MIDDLE NAME.

31:56.448 --> 31:58.284
- OH, IS THAT
WHAT THE "A" STANDS FOR?

31:58.317 --> 32:00.286
- I DIDN'T THINK
IN A MILLION YEARS

32:00.319 --> 32:02.154
YOU'D GIVE UP
AN EVENT LIKE THAT.

32:02.188 --> 32:03.689
SO I TIP MY HAT...

32:03.722 --> 32:05.124
OR SHOULD I SAY, MY WIG?

32:05.157 --> 32:07.126
[laughing]
TO YOU, KID.

32:07.159 --> 32:09.561
HUH? FOR TAKING CARE
OF YOUR KID.

32:09.595 --> 32:11.430
- ACTUALLY,
I'M THE ONE THAT--

32:11.463 --> 32:13.165
- PSST.
UM...

32:13.199 --> 32:15.701
GIVE ME UP AND I'LL TIE
YOUR BALLS SO TIGHT

32:15.734 --> 32:18.337
THEY'LL ACHE FOR A WEEK.

32:18.370 --> 32:21.173
- IS THIS PUNISHMENT?
- MM-HMM.

32:21.207 --> 32:22.174
- I HELPED.

32:22.208 --> 32:23.175
- DID YOU, HONEY?
- MM-HMM.

32:23.209 --> 32:25.044
- GOOD, BABY.

32:25.077 --> 32:27.046
- WELL, ALL THIS TALK
ABOUT BABIES

32:27.079 --> 32:30.149
HAS GIVEN ME A CRAVING
FOR THE BABY BACK RIBS.

32:30.182 --> 32:32.718
- GOT 'EM.

32:32.751 --> 32:36.355
- I'LL HAVE, UH, THE...
- TUNA FISH ON WHITE BREAD.

32:36.388 --> 32:37.990
- DOUBLE MAYO.

32:38.024 --> 32:40.692
- POTATO CHIPS AND COLESLAW.

32:40.726 --> 32:45.564
- AND VANILLA PUDDING.

32:45.597 --> 32:47.533
- CHRIST, AM I REALLY
THAT PREDICTABLE?

32:47.566 --> 32:49.368
- NO, HONEY, JUST RELIABLE.

32:49.401 --> 32:50.769
- THANKS EVER SO.

32:50.802 --> 32:54.606
- IT'S JUST NOT YOUR STYLE
TO BE SPONTANEOUS,

32:54.640 --> 32:56.608
WILD, RECKLESS.

32:56.642 --> 32:58.744
- NO, IT'S MY STYLE
TO NEVER TAKE A CHANCE,

32:58.777 --> 33:00.346
NEVER LET MYSELF GO,

33:00.379 --> 33:03.515
NEVER PUT MY ASS IN A SLING.

33:03.549 --> 33:04.783
I MEAN, ON THE LINE.

33:04.816 --> 33:07.219
- HONEY, IT'S ONLY LUNCH.

33:07.253 --> 33:10.222
- YEAH, WELL, IN THAT CASE,
I WILL HAVE THE CAJUN CATFISH

33:10.256 --> 33:13.292
WITH THE PAD THAI NOODLES
AND THE...

33:13.325 --> 33:16.495
UH, PAPAYA-MANGO SALSA
ON THE SIDE.

33:16.528 --> 33:20.299
- LETTING GO DOES NOT MEAN
GETTING THE RUNS.

33:20.332 --> 33:23.169
- [chuckle]
GIVE HIM THE USUAL.

33:23.202 --> 33:25.104
IT DOESN'T MATTER
WHAT YOU EAT.

33:25.137 --> 33:27.339
YOU'LL ALWAYS BE OLD--

33:27.373 --> 33:29.775
OLD, RELIABLE TED.

33:32.678 --> 33:34.480
- YOU KNOW, IT'S--
IT'S AMAZING

33:34.513 --> 33:36.115
HOW YOU CAN LIVE IN A CITY
YOUR WHOLE LIFE

33:36.148 --> 33:38.217
AND NOT REALIZE
HOW MANY WONDERFUL SIGHTS

33:38.250 --> 33:39.818
AND ATTRACTIONS THERE ARE,
YOU KNOW?

33:39.851 --> 33:41.520
FOR INSTANCE,
WHO KNEW THAT THERE WAS A THING

33:41.553 --> 33:42.754
CALLED THE "SCREAM MACHINE"

33:42.788 --> 33:45.624
AT THE CARNEGIE SCIENCE CENTRE,
YOU KNOW?

33:45.657 --> 33:48.427
EXPERIENCING THE G-FORCES
WAS CERTAINLY A, UH,

33:48.460 --> 33:49.661
"STOMACH CHURNING,

33:49.695 --> 33:53.165
NAIL-BITING SCIENCE
EDUCATION" FOR ME.

33:53.199 --> 33:54.700
WHAT MADE IT
ESPECIALLY MEMORABLE

33:54.733 --> 33:59.271
WAS THE LARGE PEPPERONI PIZZA
WE SHARED MOMENTS BEFORE.

33:59.305 --> 34:01.540
- CAN WE GO HOME NOW?

34:01.573 --> 34:03.609
- WHAT, AND MISS THE, UH...

34:03.642 --> 34:06.445
MONONGAHELA INCLINE?

34:09.148 --> 34:12.451
LOOK.

34:12.484 --> 34:15.421
I KNOW THIS ISN'T EASY
FOR YOU.

34:15.454 --> 34:18.824
YOU KNOW, HAVING A DAD WHO'S,
WELL...

34:18.857 --> 34:20.426
DIFFERENT
FROM OTHER FATHERS.

34:20.459 --> 34:22.228
AND I'M SURE
IT DOESN'T MAKE IT ANY EASIER

34:22.261 --> 34:23.629
SEEING HIM WITH ME.

34:23.662 --> 34:25.597
- SO HE'S GAY.
BIG DEAL.

34:25.631 --> 34:28.167
I'VE ONLY KNOWN ABOUT IT LIKE
SINCE I WAS, LIKE, NINE.

34:28.200 --> 34:30.369
PFFT.

34:30.402 --> 34:32.438
- WAIT.

34:32.471 --> 34:34.173
SO WHY DON'T YOU WANT
TO BE HERE?

34:34.206 --> 34:35.641
- 'CAUSE HE DRIVES ME NUTS.

34:35.674 --> 34:37.109
EVERY TIME I COME HERE,

34:37.143 --> 34:38.810
HE'S GOT TO HAVE
EVERY SINGLE MINUTE PLANNED.

34:38.844 --> 34:41.180
THE INCLINE, THE MUSEUM,
THE AQUARIUM.

34:41.213 --> 34:43.115
I MEAN, THAT MAY HAVE BEEN FUN
WHEN I WAS A KID,

34:43.149 --> 34:45.817
BUT...HOW MANY TIMES
CAN YOU SEE FISH?

34:45.851 --> 34:48.820
- [chuckle] SO WHY DON'T YOU
TELL HIM TO BACK OFF?

34:48.854 --> 34:51.857
- HAVE YOU EVER TRIED
TELLING HIM TO BACK OFF?

34:51.890 --> 34:52.958
- GOOD POINT.

34:52.991 --> 34:57.729
BUT YOU KNOW, HE JUST WANTS YOU
TO HAVE A GOOD TIME.

34:57.763 --> 35:00.466
- OH, MY GOD.
CHECK IT OUT.

35:00.499 --> 35:02.668
SCORPIONHEAD NUMBER 34!

35:02.701 --> 35:05.471
- HOLY SHIT! I'VE BEEN LOOKING
FOR THAT MY ENTIRE LIFE.

35:05.504 --> 35:06.738
- YOU TOO?

35:06.772 --> 35:08.574
- Y-YOU CAN'T EVEN FIND
THAT ON EBAY.

35:08.607 --> 35:11.210
[stammering]
SCORPIONHEAD IS SO COOL.

35:11.243 --> 35:13.345
- SO COOL!
THE WAY HE CAN...

35:13.379 --> 35:14.680
both: STING WITH HIS NOSE!

35:14.713 --> 35:15.747
- EXACTLY!
- YOU WANT TO CHECK IT OUT?

35:15.781 --> 35:18.116
- FUCK YEAH!

35:20.252 --> 35:23.322
[engine stopping]

35:25.657 --> 35:27.793
[dog barking]

35:48.247 --> 35:52.384
- HEY.
YOUR MOM'S IN THE KITCHEN.

35:52.418 --> 35:53.652
GET YOURSELF
A CUP OF COFFEE,

35:53.685 --> 35:56.688
AND GET ME A REFILL,
WOULD YOU?

35:56.722 --> 36:00.392
- I'M NOT HERE TO SEE HER,
ACTUALLY.

36:00.426 --> 36:02.528
- [labored breathing]

36:02.561 --> 36:04.230
- SHOULDN'T YOU BE
TAKING IT EASY?

36:04.263 --> 36:07.399
- I'LL HAVE PLENTY OF TIME
TO TAKE IT EASY.

36:07.433 --> 36:09.801
THERE'S YEARS OF STUFF
OUT HERE, I--

36:09.835 --> 36:13.505
I NEED TO--I WANT TO--
GET EVERYTHING IN ORDER.

36:13.539 --> 36:17.309
OH, WAIT TILL YOU SEE THIS,
SONNY-BOY.

36:17.343 --> 36:21.547
TA-DA!
[chuckling]

36:21.580 --> 36:23.382
- WHAT WAS THAT TEAM YOU USED
TO BOWL WITH?

36:23.415 --> 36:26.385
- EASTWAY KINGS.

36:26.418 --> 36:28.620
YOU USED TO COME WITH ME WHEN
YOU WERE, WHAT, EIGHT, NINE?

36:28.654 --> 36:29.621
YOU REMEMBER THAT?

36:29.655 --> 36:33.325
- YEAH.

36:33.359 --> 36:37.329
- I ALWAYS HOPED
YOU'D TAKE IT UP.

36:37.363 --> 36:38.964
- LISTEN,
ABOUT THE OTHER NIGHT--

36:38.997 --> 36:42.701
- I KNOW. I SHOULD'VE CALLED
BEFORE I DROPPED IN.

36:42.734 --> 36:44.503
LIKE "THE WARDEN" SAYS,

36:44.536 --> 36:47.439
"THAT'S WHAT THEY MAKE
TELEPHONES FOR."

36:47.473 --> 36:49.475
OOH, FUCK!

36:49.508 --> 36:50.709
- I GOT IT.

36:50.742 --> 36:52.978
- SHIT.

36:53.011 --> 36:54.546
[grunts]

36:54.580 --> 36:56.648
- WE NEED TO TALK.

36:56.682 --> 36:57.983
- YOU KNOW, I THINK
THAT'S THE FIRST TIME

36:58.016 --> 36:59.418
I EVER HEARD YOU SAY THAT.

36:59.451 --> 37:00.752
- YEAH, THAT'S PROBABLY

37:00.786 --> 37:03.289
'CAUSE THAT'S
THE FIRST TIME I EVER HAVE.

37:03.322 --> 37:05.524
I JUST THOUGHT
THAT MAYBE WE COULD, UH--

37:05.557 --> 37:07.726
- SNEAK IT UNDER THE WIRE, HUH?

37:07.759 --> 37:10.996
HEY, I GOT SOME BOOKS HERE.

37:11.029 --> 37:13.865
- I'M GAY.

37:26.645 --> 37:29.315
- WELL, YOU PICKED A HELL
OF A FUCKING TIME

37:29.348 --> 37:32.284
TO TELL ME YOU'RE A FAIRY.

37:35.654 --> 37:38.557
AS IF I DON'T HAVE ENOUGH
TO DEAL WITH.

37:38.590 --> 37:43.329
JEEZ.

37:43.362 --> 37:46.665
YOU'RE THE ONE THAT
SHOULD BE DYING, INSTEAD OF ME.

37:46.698 --> 37:48.900
[startled grunts]

37:53.572 --> 37:54.973
- BUT I'M NOT DYING,

37:55.006 --> 38:00.312
YOU SELFISH OLD PRICK.

38:00.346 --> 38:02.881
YOU ARE.

38:13.659 --> 38:15.494
- AW, LOOK AT THIS GUY.
- THAT'S GREAT.

38:15.527 --> 38:17.095
- HEY, GUYS.
- OH, MY GOSH.

38:17.128 --> 38:18.730
- SORRY IT TOOK SO LONG.
LONGER THAN I EXPECTED.

38:18.764 --> 38:19.998
- DAD!
- WHAT?

38:20.031 --> 38:21.733
- YOU CAN'T BELIEVE
WHAT MICHAEL AND I FOUND.

38:21.767 --> 38:23.835
SCORPIONHEAD NUMBER 34!

38:23.869 --> 38:25.371
- THAT'S--THAT'S GREAT, HANK.

38:25.404 --> 38:26.638
- YOU OWE ME 150 BUCKS.

38:26.672 --> 38:27.639
- WHOO!

38:27.673 --> 38:29.541
- OH, I'M GONNA GO PAGE ADAM.

38:29.575 --> 38:30.676
HE'S A SCORPIONHEAD
HEAD, TOO.

38:30.709 --> 38:31.743
- WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.
WAIT A SECOND.

38:31.777 --> 38:32.844
TELL ME ABOUT--
- HOLD ON, HOLD ON.

38:32.878 --> 38:35.914
HOLD ON.
- TELL ME ABOUT YOUR DAY.

38:35.947 --> 38:37.916
- WE HAD A BLAST.

38:37.949 --> 38:39.985
- GREAT.

38:40.018 --> 38:41.487
AH, LOOKS LIKE
IT WENT OFF IN HERE.

38:41.520 --> 38:43.088
- AND WHAT ABOUT YOU?
DID YOU SEE ANY, UH...

38:43.121 --> 38:44.390
NAKED PENGUINS?

38:44.423 --> 38:45.457
- YEAH, JUST THE ONE.

38:45.491 --> 38:46.558
SO T-TELL ME
ABOUT THE INCLINE.

38:46.592 --> 38:47.826
- OH, WELL, WE, UH...

38:47.859 --> 38:49.995
WE TOOK A DETOUR
FROM THE OFFICIAL ITINERARY

38:50.028 --> 38:51.830
AND WE WENT TO COMIXLAND.

38:51.863 --> 38:55.534
- WHAT ABOUT ALL THE THINGS
I HAD PLANNED?

38:55.567 --> 38:57.102
UH...

38:57.135 --> 38:58.737
YOU SAT AROUND HERE ALL DAY
AND READ COMICS?

38:58.770 --> 39:01.507
- IT WAS WHAT HANK WANTED.

39:01.540 --> 39:03.809
DON'T TAKE THIS
THE WRONG WAY,

39:03.842 --> 39:07.913
BUT HE'S NOT TOO CRAZY
ABOUT THE SCHEDULE.

39:07.946 --> 39:09.114
HE DOESN'T UNDERSTAND

39:09.147 --> 39:10.749
WHY YOU HAVE TO DRAG HIM
AROUND EVERY MINUTE.

39:10.782 --> 39:11.583
- WHO'S DRAGGING HIM AROUND?

39:11.617 --> 39:13.118
I JUST WANT HIM TO HAVE
A GOOD TIME.

39:13.151 --> 39:14.886
- WELL, MAYBE HIS IDEA
OF A GOOD TIME

39:14.920 --> 39:16.154
IS DIFFERENT THAN YOURS

39:16.187 --> 39:18.156
AND YOU DIDN'T BOTHER
TO FIND OUT WHAT IT WAS.

39:18.189 --> 39:19.991
- HEY, DON'T TELL ME
HOW TO RAISE MY SON.

39:20.025 --> 39:21.593
- I'M NOT!
I JUST--

39:21.627 --> 39:22.994
I-I'M TRYING TO HELP.

39:23.028 --> 39:24.930
- NO, BUT ALL OF A SUDDEN
YOU'RE A FUCKING AUTHORITY?

39:24.963 --> 39:26.865
- HE'S UNHAPPY HERE.
- OH.

39:26.898 --> 39:28.400
- HE WANTS TO GO HOME.

39:28.434 --> 39:29.868
AND NOT BECAUSE OF THE REASONS
THAT I THOUGHT,

39:29.901 --> 39:33.505
BUT BECAUSE OF--
BECAUSE OF YOU.

39:33.539 --> 39:36.374
YOU'RE THE PROBLEM.

40:15.013 --> 40:19.551
- THERE ARE MANY PLEASURES
TO BE FOUND HERE.

40:19.585 --> 40:25.491
PLACES THAT YOU'RE AFRAID
TO EVEN THINK OF GOING.

40:25.524 --> 40:27.793
I CAN TAKE YOU THERE.

40:27.826 --> 40:30.662
BUT FIRST,
YOU MUST SURRENDER TO ME.

40:30.696 --> 40:34.232
COMPLETELY.

40:34.265 --> 40:39.938
DO YOU SURRENDER?

40:39.971 --> 40:41.139
- YES, I-I SURRENDER.

40:41.172 --> 40:42.874
- "SIR."

40:42.908 --> 40:47.779
YOU WILL CALL ME "SIR."

40:47.813 --> 40:49.748
- SIR.

40:55.954 --> 40:59.457
- AND YOU ARE "SLAVE."

41:07.966 --> 41:09.568
- IT'S--IT'S KIND OF COLD
IN HERE.

41:09.601 --> 41:11.036
- I DIDN'T SAY
YOU COULD SPEAK.

41:11.069 --> 41:15.240
- I'M SORRY.
- "SIR."

41:15.273 --> 41:17.042
- I'M SORRY, SIR.

41:26.752 --> 41:28.253
- GOOD SLAVE.

41:28.286 --> 41:31.623
NOW YOU WILL DO EXACTLY
AS YOU ARE TOLD.

42:53.104 --> 42:54.640
- SO I THOUGHT THIS SUMMER,

42:54.673 --> 42:56.174
WE COULD GO
WHITE WATER RAFTING.

42:56.207 --> 42:58.677
- I'M GOING TO BASEBALL CAMP
THIS SUMMER.

42:58.710 --> 43:00.345
- OH.
WELL, THAT'S GOOD.

43:00.378 --> 43:01.713
WELL, THANKSGIVING
WE COULD GO HIKING.

43:01.747 --> 43:03.014
HIKING--

43:03.048 --> 43:05.016
- WE'RE GOING TO GRANDMA
AND GRANDPA'S.

43:05.050 --> 43:06.618
- OKAY, THAT TAKES US
TO CHRISTMAS.

43:06.652 --> 43:07.653
CHRISTMAS
WE CAN GO SKIING.

43:07.686 --> 43:10.021
- YOU JUST DON'T GET IT,
DO YOU?

43:17.295 --> 43:20.999
- NEXT IN LINE.

43:21.032 --> 43:24.736
- MICHAEL TOLD ME YOU WEREN'T
HAVING A VERY GOOD TIME.

43:24.770 --> 43:28.206
AND I DIDN'T WANT
TO BELIEVE HIM.

43:28.239 --> 43:30.341
YOU KNOW, I WAS JUST
TRYING REALLY HARD TO--

43:30.375 --> 43:32.844
- THAT'S JUST IT, DAD.

43:32.878 --> 43:34.680
YOU JUST TRY TOO HARD.

43:34.713 --> 43:36.715
- YEAH, I GUESS I DO.

43:36.748 --> 43:38.984
I SUPPOSE THAT'S BECAUSE I DON'T
GET TO SEE YOU VERY OFTEN.

43:39.017 --> 43:42.053
YOU LIVE OUT THERE,
AND I'M BACK HERE.

43:42.087 --> 43:44.690
SO FOR THOSE FEW DAYS THAT
I'M LUCKY ENOUGH TO HAVE YOU,

43:44.723 --> 43:46.257
I JUST WANT IT
TO BE SOMETHING SPECIAL.

43:46.291 --> 43:49.828
SOME--SOMETHING.

43:49.861 --> 43:51.863
SO YOU REMEMBER ME.

43:51.897 --> 43:54.666
SO YOU WON'T FORGET ME.

43:54.700 --> 43:57.135
- WHEN I'M WITH YOU, I'M GETTING
AWAY FROM MOM AND GARY

43:57.168 --> 44:00.271
AND ALL THAT BULLSHIT STRESS
HAPPENS AT SCHOOL.

44:00.305 --> 44:03.274
AND, I MEAN,
I JUST WANT TO HANG OUT,

44:03.308 --> 44:05.877
NOT HAVE TO WORRY
ABOUT DOING SOMETHING

44:05.911 --> 44:11.717
EVERY SINGLE MINUTE
OF MY DAY.

44:11.750 --> 44:16.354
- YOU MEAN JUST LIKE
LYING AROUND, READING COMICS?

44:16.387 --> 44:17.989
- YEAH.

44:18.023 --> 44:19.858
I MEAN,
IF I FEEL LIKE IT.

44:19.891 --> 44:22.728
- AMERICAN AIRLINES FLIGHT 1815
TO PORTLAND

44:22.761 --> 44:26.297
IS NOW READY FOR BOARDING.

44:26.331 --> 44:28.033
- THAT'S YOU.

44:28.066 --> 44:30.769
- [sighing]
- CALL ME TONIGHT.

44:30.802 --> 44:32.838
NO MATTER HOW LATE IT IS.

44:32.871 --> 44:36.207
- OKAY, I WILL.

44:36.241 --> 44:39.310
- BYE, HANK.

44:39.344 --> 44:40.445
- NEXT.

44:40.478 --> 44:43.281
- THANKS
FOR THE SCORPIONHEAD.

44:49.054 --> 44:52.858
- BYE-BYE.

44:52.891 --> 44:55.360
- NEXT PERSON IN LINE,
PLEASE.

44:58.797 --> 45:03.201
- YOU KNOW, I ACTUALLY
DON'T MIND BEING A STEPMOTHER.

45:03.234 --> 45:04.870
- FOR SOMEONE WHO HAD NEVER
HAD A FATHER,

45:04.903 --> 45:07.405
YOU SURE KNOW A LOT
ABOUT BEING ONE.

45:07.438 --> 45:09.307
- WELL, I JUST...

45:09.340 --> 45:14.846
IMAGINED WHAT I'D WANT HIM
TO ACT LIKE IF I DID.

45:14.880 --> 45:18.216
SO, WE'VE GOT THE HOUSE
ALL TO OURSELF AGAIN.

45:18.249 --> 45:20.485
WHAT DO YOU FEEL LIKE DOING?

45:20.518 --> 45:24.222
- I DON'T KNOW, LAUNDRY?
BOOKKEEPING?

45:24.255 --> 45:28.426
- TRY AGAIN, STUD.

45:28.459 --> 45:30.161
- I MEAN,
YOU GAVE ME YOUR WORD.

45:30.195 --> 45:32.864
YOU SWORE
I COULD TRUST YOU WITH HIM.

45:32.898 --> 45:36.001
- LOOK, YOUR EX ALREADY
REAMED ME OUT.

45:36.034 --> 45:38.036
- WELL, NOW IT'S MY TURN.

45:38.069 --> 45:39.504
YOU SAID YOU WANTED
TO BE HIS PARENT.

45:39.537 --> 45:41.239
IF THAT'S TRUE,
THEN FUCKING WELL BE ONE.

45:41.272 --> 45:44.075
BUT DON'T TELL ME YOU'LL BE
THERE FOR HIM WHEN YOU'RE NOT.

45:44.109 --> 45:45.443
WHEN YOU'VE NEVER BEEN THERE
FOR ANYONE ELSE

45:45.476 --> 45:46.878
OTHER THAN YOURSELF.

45:46.912 --> 45:48.880
- HEY, SONNY-BOY.
[knocking on door]

45:48.914 --> 45:53.518
ANYONE HOME?

45:53.551 --> 45:54.886
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

45:54.920 --> 45:58.156
- I'LL ONLY BE A MINUTE.

45:58.189 --> 46:00.558
I FOUND SOMETHING WHEN I WAS
GOING THROUGH THOSE BOXES.

46:00.591 --> 46:03.261
I THOUGHT
YOU MIGHT WANT IT.

46:03.294 --> 46:08.333
THAT'S ME AND YOU
WHEN YOU WERE FOUR MONTHS OLD.

46:08.366 --> 46:09.935
- WHY ARE YOU SMILING?

46:09.968 --> 46:11.136
- IT'S A PHOTOGRAPH.

46:11.169 --> 46:12.804
ISN'T THAT
WHAT YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO DO?

46:12.838 --> 46:15.406
- I DON'T WANT IT.

46:15.440 --> 46:19.911
- YOU MIGHT CHANGE YOUR MIND
ONE DAY, WHEN I'M GONE.

46:19.945 --> 46:23.548
- I DOUBT IT.

46:23.581 --> 46:28.319
- YOU KNOW, YOU CAN REALLY
PACK A WALLOP FOR A FAG.

46:28.353 --> 46:31.422
JUST DON'T TELL YOUR MOTHER,
YOU UNDERSTAND?

46:31.456 --> 46:35.827
SHE'LL BE AT FUCKING MASS
THREE TIMES A DAY, PRAYING--

46:35.861 --> 46:38.930
- MR. KINNEY.

46:38.964 --> 46:43.501
YOU PROBABLY DON'T REMEMBER ME,
BUT...I'M LINDSAY.

46:43.534 --> 46:47.038
PETERSEN.
- COURSE I REMEMBER YOU.

46:47.072 --> 46:50.175
ALTHOUGH IT'S BEEN A--
A LONG TIME.

46:50.208 --> 46:51.877
YOU'RE STILL A LOOKER.

46:51.910 --> 46:53.078
- THANK YOU, MR. KINNEY.

46:53.111 --> 46:54.913
- JACK.

46:54.946 --> 46:59.450
- WHAT, DO YOU STILL THINK
YOU'RE A LADIES' MAN?

46:59.484 --> 47:03.221
- YOU HAVE YOURSELF
A BEAUTIFUL SON.

47:03.254 --> 47:07.092
- YEAH.

47:07.125 --> 47:10.461
- WELL, I GUESS
I'LL BE ON MY WAY.

47:10.495 --> 47:13.464
- THERE'S SOMEONE ELSE
I WANT YOU TO SAY HELLO TO.

47:13.498 --> 47:17.035
[Gus cooing]

47:18.937 --> 47:22.140
YOUR GRANDSON.

47:22.173 --> 47:28.113
- MY GRANDSON?

47:28.146 --> 47:30.615
WHAT THE FUCK'S GOING ON?

47:30.648 --> 47:32.918
ARE YOU SCREWING WITH ME,
SONNY-BOY?

47:32.951 --> 47:38.256
- NO, I'M NOT SCREWING
WITH YOU.

47:38.289 --> 47:41.426
- JACK, WOULD YOU LIKE
TO HOLD HIM?

47:41.459 --> 47:43.528
- OH, I--

47:43.561 --> 47:48.366
IT'S BEEN A WHILE, YOU KNOW,
SINCE I HELD A BABY, BUT...

47:48.399 --> 47:50.969
YEAH.

47:56.607 --> 47:59.077
