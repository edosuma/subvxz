13:23.177 --> 13:25.721
Now, when I say,
"Hello, Mr. Thompson"

13:25.805 --> 13:29.725
and press down on your foot,
you smile and nod.

13:29.809 --> 13:32.520
-No problem.
-Hello, Mr. Thompson.

13:35.147 --> 13:38.484
I think he's talking to you.

13:40.069 --> 13:43.280
-Here you go.
-Oh, what a cute convertible.

13:43.364 --> 13:45.324

15:02.151 --> 15:03.736
if you don't like
your neighbors,

15:03.819 --> 15:07.031

Surely there's no harm

17:12.948 --> 17:14.241
Bart, don't interrupt.

17:14.324 --> 17:15.993

17:49.777 --> 17:52.321
Dad, I'm kind of edgy

17:52.404 --> 17:54.948
I'd appreciate you
not coming in my room

17:55.032 --> 17:57.367

a butcher knife.

17:57.451 --> 17:59.119

19:15.779 --> 19:18.574
Well, there is one, but...

19:20.367 --> 19:22.995
-Nah.
-No, go on.

19:23.078 --> 19:26.123
Well, you have such
a beautiful voice.

19:26.206 --> 19:28.083
Guilty as charged.
