17:52.467 --> 17:54.467
- Oh, they went down.
- Oh, f---.

17:54.467 --> 17:57.200
- Oh, sh--.
- Oh, my God.

17:57.200 --> 17:59.000
- Go, go, go, go.
It's an emergency.

17:59.033 --> 18:00.333
Go, go, go, go!

18:00.333 --> 18:02.300
- Oh, my God,
she got hurt.

18:02.333 --> 18:04.367
- Captain Sandy, Captain Sandy,
we got a guest down.

18:04.367 --> 18:06.266
- What happened?

18:09.367 --> 18:09.600
[dramatic music]

18:10.533 --> 18:11.500
- [laughs]

18:11.533 --> 18:13.300
[splashing]

18:13.333 --> 18:15.033
Oh, they went down.
- Oh, sh--.

18:15.066 --> 18:16.500
- Go, go, go, go.
It's an emergency.

18:16.533 --> 18:19.233
Go, go!
- Oh, my God. She got hurt.

18:19.266 --> 18:21.100
- Captain Sandy, Captain Sandy,
we got a guest down.

18:21.100 --> 18:22.500
We need a first aid kit.
- What happened?

18:22.500 --> 18:24.233
- They fell off of the banana
and I think

18:24.266 --> 18:26.233
they might have hit heads.
- F---ing sh--.

18:26.266 --> 18:28.200
I can't leave the bridge
because we're dragging anchor.

18:28.233 --> 18:29.633
Just get the first aid kit.

18:29.633 --> 18:31.233
- Do you think she's in
a bit of shock?

18:31.233 --> 18:33.233
- I don't know.
- Is she okay?

18:33.233 --> 18:35.100
- All right,
quick couple questions.

18:35.100 --> 18:36.266
Do you know what year it is?

18:38.100 --> 18:39.767
- You know where you're at?

18:40.000 --> 18:42.200
- Perfect.
Let's go around this way.

18:42.233 --> 18:44.266
- She's shaking a bit.
I'll get her a Coke, okay?

18:44.266 --> 18:47.400
- She needs to sit down.
- Just needs to sit down.

18:47.400 --> 18:49.400
- You okay?
- Yeah. My ribs are, like--

18:49.433 --> 18:51.500
I feel like my ribs
were crushed.

18:53.266 --> 18:54.266
- You all right?
- Yeah.

18:54.300 --> 18:55.467
I thought the worst,

18:55.500 --> 18:58.066
so I go into firefighter mode.

18:58.100 --> 19:01.233
And I wanna impress Captain
Sandy, I wanna impress Wes,

19:01.266 --> 19:02.533
I wanna impress Malia.

19:02.567 --> 19:04.400
- Bobby, thank you.
- Of course.

19:04.433 --> 19:06.266
- As a kid growing up,
my parents never let me

19:06.266 --> 19:08.533
around bananas.
- No, me either, actually.

19:08.533 --> 19:10.200
- Yeah. My parents were just
like, no banana ever.

19:10.233 --> 19:12.133
- Deck crew,
we're dragging anchor.

19:12.133 --> 19:13.533
Please move the stuff away
from the swim platform.

19:13.533 --> 19:15.400
- We're still working
on getting our guest

19:15.433 --> 19:17.266
off the swim platform, here.
She's injured, so--

19:17.266 --> 19:19.400
- I'm dragging anchor,
so I don't have a choice.

19:19.400 --> 19:21.200
You gotta move the toy.
The wind's picked up.

19:21.233 --> 19:23.000
- Yeah, please,
if I could get someone

19:23.033 --> 19:25.033
down here on
the swim platform, please.

19:25.066 --> 19:26.600
- Line clear.
- Just pull it in.

19:29.433 --> 19:31.500
- All right, Captain,
all toys are onboard.

19:31.533 --> 19:33.433
We're just getting
the wave runner on now.

19:33.433 --> 19:35.100
- Thank you.

19:35.133 --> 19:36.567
- Nice job, deck crew.

19:36.600 --> 19:38.166
- Anchor coming up.

19:43.400 --> 19:45.266
- Thanks for saving her, guys.
Appreciate it.

19:45.300 --> 19:46.233
- No problem.
- Good job.

19:48.567 --> 19:52.166
- I think I might send Bugs
with you today.

19:52.200 --> 19:53.433
- That'd be nice.

19:53.433 --> 19:54.633
- Hello, hello.

19:54.667 --> 19:56.500
- Bugs?
- Yes, Hannah?

19:56.533 --> 19:59.033
- It might be nice for you
to go with Adam today.

19:59.066 --> 20:00.567
- What do you think?
- That sounds cool.

20:00.567 --> 20:02.233
- Take a little stroll
into town.

20:02.266 --> 20:03.700
- Yeah.
- Maybe we can grab a coffee

20:03.700 --> 20:05.433
if there's time.
- Yeah.

20:05.467 --> 20:07.300
- Bugs has been amazing,
so I definitely wanna

20:07.333 --> 20:09.600
give her the opportunity
to chill out a little bit.

20:09.600 --> 20:12.133
- I'm so excited.

20:12.166 --> 20:14.200
- Okay, guys.
Get ready to dock.

20:14.233 --> 20:15.734
- Copy that.
- What's my distance

20:15.734 --> 20:17.467
off the bow?
- We're at about 10 meters

20:17.467 --> 20:19.333
to the dock on the bow.

20:19.333 --> 20:20.600
- Fenders on the bow
need to come down.

20:20.600 --> 20:22.400
- Copy that.
- This is talent.

20:22.433 --> 20:23.700
- We are touching fenders.
Jeez, these lines

20:23.734 --> 20:25.600
are too heavy.

20:25.600 --> 20:28.200
- Come on, guys, get the stern
line out of the water.

20:28.233 --> 20:32.133
I never want a line
in the water. Ever.

20:32.166 --> 20:34.200
It's yachting 101.
You don't drop the stern line

20:34.233 --> 20:35.600
in the water while
the captain's maneuvering.

20:35.633 --> 20:37.333
It could get caught
in the prop.

20:37.333 --> 20:38.333
Next thing you know,
I smash the dock.

20:38.333 --> 20:40.066
I screw the prop.

20:40.100 --> 20:41.533
- All right, Captain.
All lines are sure.

20:41.567 --> 20:42.600
We've got some good tension
on the stern.

20:42.633 --> 20:43.600
And our springs are tight.

20:43.633 --> 20:45.600
- Okay. Thank you.

20:48.367 --> 20:49.567
[knock at door]

20:49.600 --> 20:51.200
So are you okay?

20:56.233 --> 20:58.500
- If you need anything, pick up
your phone and call the bridge.

20:58.533 --> 21:00.300
- Thanks for checking on me.
- Okay. All right.

21:00.333 --> 21:02.500
- That's so sweet of you.
- Okay.

21:02.500 --> 21:05.567
- Lauren, I'm gonna chain your
hands to that ironing board.

21:05.600 --> 21:07.233
- I'm almost done.
I'm almost done.

21:07.266 --> 21:08.767
Look, I have
two more rings to do.

21:08.767 --> 21:11.433
- Good.
- I'm really easily distracted.

21:11.467 --> 21:14.300
- I can tell.
- Don't you worry.

21:14.333 --> 21:16.500
Go relax, girl.

21:16.500 --> 21:18.233
- Do you mind me speaking to you
for two seconds?

21:18.233 --> 21:20.233
- Yeah, of course.

21:20.233 --> 21:22.633
- I was just wondering,
you know, if you're away,

21:22.633 --> 21:25.567
if you wouldn't mind me stepping
in to call her out on something

21:25.600 --> 21:27.700
if I see it happening.
- Yeah, no, no, no.

21:27.734 --> 21:29.667
Of course.
- She's gonna need, like,

21:29.667 --> 21:31.667
a good talking-to
every now and again.

21:31.667 --> 21:33.667
- I know. Bugs has had
management experience,

21:33.700 --> 21:37.266
so I have total faith in her
whipping Lauren into shape

21:37.266 --> 21:39.667
and allowing me to step off
a little bit.

21:39.667 --> 21:42.400
Awesome.
- Thanks.

21:42.400 --> 21:44.200
- Have a great time.

21:44.233 --> 21:45.667
- Anything you want us
to bring back?

21:45.667 --> 21:49.400
- A nice husband, maybe?
- I'll work on that.

21:49.400 --> 21:50.500
[laughter]

21:50.533 --> 21:52.667
- I just love the architecture.

21:52.667 --> 21:54.600
- Whoo!
- Oh, this is beautiful.

21:54.633 --> 21:58.200
Is this where we're going?
- Beautiful.

21:58.233 --> 22:00.533
all: Yay!

22:00.533 --> 22:02.133
- Adam, are you ready?

22:02.166 --> 22:03.333
Should we go?
- Yeah.

22:03.367 --> 22:05.000
- Let's go.

22:05.000 --> 22:06.467
Feels so good to be
off the boat.

22:06.500 --> 22:07.734
- You know, just a little sun.

22:07.767 --> 22:09.667
- Oh, look at--
this is old-school.

22:09.667 --> 22:11.033
- Excuse me, sir,
you don't happen to have

22:11.033 --> 22:12.300
any fresh fish, do you?

22:12.333 --> 22:13.567
- Oh, wow.
- Oh, that's what

22:13.567 --> 22:15.300
I'm talking about.
- Ohh.

22:15.300 --> 22:16.633
- This is as fresh as it gets,
right there.

22:16.667 --> 22:19.033
The inspiration for me
as a yacht chef

22:19.033 --> 22:21.033
comes from following
the culture.

22:21.033 --> 22:22.433
It's good to have you around.
You see this big boat here?

22:22.433 --> 22:24.166
- Yeah.
- Bring it by.

22:24.200 --> 22:25.700
- Yes, I'm going to.
- Thank you so much.

22:25.734 --> 22:27.300
We'll see you soon, all right?
- Nice to meet you.

22:27.333 --> 22:28.567
- Thank you!
- Thanks again.

22:28.567 --> 22:30.166
- Bon appétit.
- Bon appétit.

22:30.200 --> 22:31.700
- Round five.
Cheers, cheers.

22:31.734 --> 22:34.033
- We're not having dinner
anytime early, are we?

22:34.033 --> 22:36.300
[laughter]

22:36.300 --> 22:38.433
- You know Matthew McConaughey?
- Mm-mm.

22:38.433 --> 22:40.567
- Well, he's always like, "All
right, all right, all right."

22:40.567 --> 22:41.700
- Who's that?
- "All right, all right,

22:41.700 --> 22:44.233
all right."
- [laughs]

22:44.266 --> 22:47.300
- Malia just blatantly
disregards me.

22:47.300 --> 22:49.300
I just think she doesn't want
any part of me

22:49.333 --> 22:51.567
because of all the drama
that happened in the past.

22:51.600 --> 22:53.467
You f---ing cock block me.

22:53.467 --> 22:55.600
You say, oh,
Bobby's not worth it.

22:55.633 --> 22:57.600
I feel completely alone
right now.

22:57.600 --> 23:00.266
Oh, God.
- "Failure to Launch,"

23:00.300 --> 23:02.166
"Magic Mike" and "Fool's Gold."
- Of course I know

23:02.200 --> 23:04.066
who Matthew McConaughey is.
- Oh, jeez.

23:04.066 --> 23:05.600
- Really?
- Like, come on, guys.

23:05.633 --> 23:07.333
- "Magic Mike" is what
you're gonna go with?

23:09.367 --> 23:11.000
"Lincoln Lawyer."
- I started with

23:11.033 --> 23:12.600
"Failure to Launch."
That's not a bad one.

23:12.633 --> 23:14.600
- Aw. Oh, he's so cute.

23:14.600 --> 23:16.667
- This is not a good hose.

23:16.700 --> 23:18.433
[both laughing]

23:20.066 --> 23:21.600
- You don't think you're gonna
do it for life?

23:21.600 --> 23:22.734
- This yachting thing?
- Yeah.

23:22.767 --> 23:24.600
- No, I can't.
I'm missing that

23:24.600 --> 23:26.734
love aspect in my life.
- Yeah.

23:26.734 --> 23:29.000
Thanks for being so strong,
you know,

23:29.033 --> 23:31.033
with your grandma dying
and everything, that's--

23:31.066 --> 23:32.600
- Thank you.
- The way you're going about it

23:32.600 --> 23:34.500
is the most professional thing.

23:34.500 --> 23:37.633
The eager beaver Bugs
that I initially found

23:37.633 --> 23:39.633
kind of annoying...
- Do we need this?

23:39.667 --> 23:43.767
- I don't know. Stupid questions
get harsh answers.

23:43.767 --> 23:45.500
Is actually
really pleasant.

23:45.533 --> 23:47.033
It's obvious you and I
are gonna be working

23:47.066 --> 23:48.433
really well together
this season.

23:48.467 --> 23:49.633
- Yeah.
- I'm pumped about that.

23:49.633 --> 23:50.633
- Should we get back
to the boat?

23:50.667 --> 23:51.734
- Let's do it.

23:53.367 --> 23:54.767
- I'm ready to do service now.

23:54.767 --> 23:57.633
- Okay, I'm gonna go down
for my break.

23:57.633 --> 24:00.767
- Ooh. Back to work.

24:00.767 --> 24:02.500
- Okay, I'm gonna go down.

24:02.500 --> 24:04.767
Just call me if you need me.
- Okay.

24:04.767 --> 24:07.367
- [speaking foreign language]

24:07.367 --> 24:09.767
- This town looks so cool.
- Yeah, I'd love

24:09.767 --> 24:10.767
to walk around here.

24:11.000 --> 24:12.633
Maybe we'll just sneak out.

24:15.100 --> 24:18.133
- Looks like our guests
have met the neighbors.

24:18.133 --> 24:20.467
- We are bringing
the party onboard.

24:21.500 --> 24:24.000
- [speaking foreign language]

24:24.000 --> 24:25.667
- Oh, they're inviting
guests over. All right.

24:25.667 --> 24:27.133
All crew, all crew,
we've got the guests

24:27.133 --> 24:28.667
returning back to the boat.

24:28.667 --> 24:30.333
Looks like they've got
ten plus guests

24:30.367 --> 24:31.400
coming onboard now.

24:31.433 --> 24:32.633
Stand by.

24:39.133 --> 24:41.667
- I hope you don't mind,
I've brought some friends.

24:41.667 --> 24:43.400
- We have eight charter guests

24:43.400 --> 24:44.400
plus an extra ten.

24:44.433 --> 24:46.066
And one stewardess.

24:46.100 --> 24:48.667
Like, oh, sh--.
- Come on, welcome aboard.

24:48.700 --> 24:51.533
- Coming up...
- $350 per person for the tip.

24:51.533 --> 24:53.667
- I have to say no.
- Are you f---ing kidding me?

24:53.667 --> 24:57.533
Hey, no, no, no, wait.
- This is awkward as f---.

24:57.533 --> 24:59.000
- And later...

25:01.166 --> 25:04.400
I'm not gonna let Wes
take her.

25:08.200 --> 25:08.567
- I hope you don't mind,

25:08.567 --> 25:09.133
- I hope you don't mind,
I've brought some friends.

25:11.400 --> 25:13.433
- Welcome aboard.
- Shoes off, in the basket.

25:13.433 --> 25:16.567
- This is magic. Voila.
- Party.

25:16.567 --> 25:18.567
- These are my people.
- I see that.

25:18.567 --> 25:21.500
We wanna party.
- Does that mean round of shots?

25:21.533 --> 25:23.300
- I guess.
- Sure.

25:23.333 --> 25:25.367
- I'm finally not in laundry,
and I have

25:25.400 --> 25:27.433
eight charter guests,
plus an extra ten.

25:27.433 --> 25:28.567
Hannah and Bugs
are both on break,

25:28.600 --> 25:30.400
and it's just overwhelming.

25:30.433 --> 25:33.033
- Can we have espresso martinis?
- Absolutely.

25:33.033 --> 25:35.000
But this is my time to shine.

25:35.033 --> 25:37.700
- We're gonna go to the roof.
- Oh, perfect, yes.

25:37.700 --> 25:39.400
- Hey, man.
- Yo.

25:39.433 --> 25:40.734
- I know this is not
your department.

25:40.734 --> 25:42.066
Do you know
where the beers are?

25:42.066 --> 25:43.600
- Of course. Right here.

25:43.600 --> 25:44.734
Why are they asking the chef
for drinks?

25:44.734 --> 25:46.467
There's three stewardesses.

25:46.467 --> 25:48.467
That's six hands
to make cocktails.

25:48.500 --> 25:50.400

- No, of course.

43:25.767 --> 43:28.700

just shout to me

43:38.200 --> 43:40.033

43:40.066 --> 43:41.700

43:41.734 --> 43:43.600
She was raised in Honduras.

43:43.633 --> 43:45.500
She came to the United States

43:45.533 --> 43:47.200
to provide a better life
for me and my sister

43:47.233 --> 43:49.667
and I've just always
tried to please her.

43:49.700 --> 43:51.533

doing it naturally

43:51.567 --> 43:52.667

43:57.633 --> 43:59.734
- Hey, guys.
What's going on?

43:59.767 --> 44:01.467
- We're just having
a discussion.

44:01.500 --> 44:03.000
- Okay. I'd like to be
involved in it,

44:03.033 --> 44:04.100
if you don't mind.
- No, that's fine.

44:04.133 --> 44:06.133
- As your chief stew.

44:06.166 --> 44:08.100

that Bugs has had

44:08.133 --> 44:09.667

44:09.700 --> 44:12.233
But I need my girls to be
communicating with me.

44:12.266 --> 44:15.000

other crew members

44:15.000 --> 44:17.600
are respecting my position
and how much I do.

44:17.633 --> 44:20.500
I'm just so over this.
It's like, I work my ass off.

44:25.700 --> 44:28.300

I'm running around like crazy

44:28.300 --> 44:30.033
and there's three deckhands
sitting there.

44:30.066 --> 44:32.266
- Well, then, tell them.
Ask them for their help.

44:32.300 --> 44:34.033
- I don't feel comfortable
doing that.

44:34.066 --> 44:35.567
- Be f---ing assertive.

44:35.600 --> 44:37.700

- What do you hate more:

44:37.700 --> 44:40.166

or ending up like this?

44:46.033 --> 44:47.667

53:25.433 --> 53:28.200
- I just wondered,
who's the next in line?

53:28.233 --> 53:29.700
- That's a sh-- thing to say.

53:29.734 --> 53:32.467
- So the food needed to be ready
40 minutes ago?

53:32.467 --> 53:35.166
- Well, I guess I'm a f---ing
bad chief stew, then, all right?

53:35.200 --> 53:37.567
- Maybe Bugsy should be
the chief stew.

53:37.600 --> 53:39.700
- Primary guests, Ken and Amber.

53:39.734 --> 53:41.333
- I may need some wine.

53:41.367 --> 53:43.266
[laughter]
- Is that Kenny again?

53:43.300 --> 53:46.300
- We've gone through
6 1/2 bottles of vodka

53:46.333 --> 53:48.567
in less than 12 hours.

53:48.600 --> 53:51.066
[laughter]

53:51.100 --> 53:53.066
- Four of the guests
have written "no onions."

53:53.066 --> 53:54.333
- Hey, Hannah.

53:55.333 --> 53:57.333
- Can we get another one
with no onion?

53:57.333 --> 53:59.066
- They can f--- off.
- I get you're pissed off,

53:59.066 --> 54:00.467
but don't take it out on me.

54:00.467 --> 54:02.433
- I got you, you little slut.

54:02.467 --> 54:04.333
[dramatic music]

54:04.367 --> 54:07.266
