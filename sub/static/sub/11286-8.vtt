00:03.597 --> 00:05.864
Don't you guys
just love Halloween?

00:05.930 --> 00:10.364
Out of all the pagan holidays,
it's the most Christmas‐sy.

00:12.164 --> 00:14.730
Once again, pumpkin pie,
we are in sync

00:14.797 --> 00:16.530
'cause I too love Halloween.

00:16.597 --> 00:18.664
To celebrate the mysterious
and frightening unknown

00:18.730 --> 00:20.664
that lurks within us all.

00:20.730 --> 00:23.064
O‐oh, scary!

00:23.130 --> 00:25.464
Now, would you grow up already?

00:25.530 --> 00:27.630
A bunch of people
dressed up like idiots

00:27.697 --> 00:29.830
go door to door
asking for handouts.

00:29.897 --> 00:31.464
What is that?

00:31.530 --> 00:34.130
You on any given day.

00:35.697 --> 00:36.930
‐ Morning, people.
‐ 'Hey.'

00:36.997 --> 00:38.064
Do you have any java?

00:38.130 --> 00:40.530
I am nothin' without
my first cup of coffee.

00:40.597 --> 00:42.064
Yeah, well,
you're nothing with it.

00:43.964 --> 00:50.497
Max, Max, perhaps, you should go
as a lady this Halloween, huh?

00:52.164 --> 00:53.430
Check it out, ya'll.

00:53.497 --> 00:55.930
The dumb waiter
is now fully operational.

00:55.997 --> 00:57.330
‐ Oh, good.
‐ Yes. Okay.

00:58.697 --> 01:00.537
Hmm, that's strange.

01:04.337 --> 01:06.070
'Must be a short in the wiring.'

01:10.370 --> 01:12.770
[screaming]

01:21.404 --> 01:23.670
That was good, man.
That was real good.

01:23.737 --> 01:26.970
‐ I knew it was a joke.
‐ I think I swallowed my gum.

[chuckles]

02:10.509 --> 02:13.244
I don't know why you guys
go through such a fuss?

02:13.310 --> 02:16.244
Not once has a trick‐or‐treater
ever knock on our door.

02:16.310 --> 02:18.610
Oh, ye of little faith.

02:20.410 --> 02:21.710
And height.

02:23.544 --> 02:25.877
Could someone grab a broom
and clear out the old cobwebs

02:25.944 --> 02:27.544
so I could put up
the fake scary ones?

02:28.810 --> 02:30.944
Don't look at me.
I got a deadline to meet.

02:31.010 --> 02:32.244
Maxine?

02:32.310 --> 02:34.744
Oh, come on, look, I told you
not to involve me

02:34.810 --> 02:36.744
in your stupid Halloween crap,
okay?

02:36.810 --> 02:40.110
I eat treat every day,
and no trick can scare me.

02:41.444 --> 02:43.377
‐ No trick?
‐ None.

02:43.444 --> 02:45.410
Now, hand me that candy bag
right over there.

02:45.477 --> 02:48.044
No, we got nothing,
but healthy snacks in this one.

02:48.110 --> 02:51.344
We got shredded wheat cookie.
Oat muffin.

02:51.410 --> 02:54.477
And for the kid in all of us,
fiber bars.

02:56.610 --> 02:59.510
Just what every eight year old
looks forward to on Halloween.

02:59.577 --> 03:01.084
Regularity.

03:02.984 --> 03:05.250
Muffins and fiber bars?

03:06.917 --> 03:08.217
Let me go get some milk.

03:10.917 --> 03:12.917
I know there's got to be
something we can do

03:12.984 --> 03:14.784
to get Max
to the Halloween spirit.

03:15.884 --> 03:17.917
I say we scare
the bejesus out of her.

03:19.450 --> 03:22.417
Yeah! What is bejesus?

03:23.384 --> 03:24.584
I'll tell you later.

03:24.650 --> 03:26.117
But for now,
here's what we're gonna do.

03:26.184 --> 03:27.817
[whispering]

03:27.884 --> 03:29.717
[evil laughter]

03:36.084 --> 03:38.750
‐ What's the word, Obie?
‐ Uh, oat muffin, my brother?

03:40.050 --> 03:43.084
‐ No..
‐ Yeah..

03:43.150 --> 03:45.217
Khadijah, you ready
to go to the listening party?

03:45.284 --> 03:46.984
Party?

03:48.450 --> 03:51.250
I'm sorry, baby.
I‐I got to finish this article.

03:53.117 --> 03:55.817
This is the second time
you canceled on me this week.

03:55.884 --> 03:58.917
I‐I.. But you are going with me
to the Halogen Records

03:58.984 --> 04:00.724
Halloween party tomorrow night,
right?

04:02.990 --> 04:04.324
I want to, but I can't.

04:04.390 --> 04:05.924
Look, I know you're busy,
but it's important to me

04:05.990 --> 04:07.257
that you come.

04:08.857 --> 04:10.424
I'll do the toe thing.

04:15.424 --> 04:17.357
Okay.

04:20.557 --> 04:22.357
That's what I thought.

04:22.424 --> 04:23.990
And hey, everyone,
if you don't have plans

04:24.057 --> 04:26.157
why don't you come along?
It is gonna be the bomb.

04:26.224 --> 04:28.824
[chuckles]
Sure, you know, you don't have
to ask me twice.

04:28.890 --> 04:32.090
Record execs and celebrities,
I'm there.

04:32.157 --> 04:34.490
And that toe thing
won't be necessary.

04:36.723 --> 04:39.957
Yeah, well, count me out.
I hate Halloween parties.

04:40.024 --> 04:42.357
When I was seven, I went to one.

04:42.424 --> 04:44.657
Bunch of mean kids
brought me to a graveyard

04:44.724 --> 04:46.957
tied me to a tombstone,
and left me there to rot.

04:47.990 --> 04:50.690
Oh, that's terrible.
What happened?

04:50.757 --> 04:53.190
Oh, kid tied at the crypt
next to me worked me free

04:53.257 --> 04:54.657
with his teeth.

04:55.690 --> 04:57.557
[knocking on door]

04:57.624 --> 05:00.764
Max, could you get that for me,
please?

05:12.164 --> 05:14.097
Right axe, wrong head.

05:16.664 --> 05:19.097
I told you, man,
she's only afraid of garlic

05:19.164 --> 05:21.030
holy water and direct sunlight.

05:34.530 --> 05:37.330
Come on, Khadijah,
we're gonna be late.

05:37.397 --> 05:39.630
Hey, Obie, look, it's Cher.

05:42.464 --> 05:44.364
I'm Cleopatra, you nut.

05:44.430 --> 05:47.164
Sorry, I didn't know they had
polyester on the Nile.

05:50.764 --> 05:52.730
No time for pleasantries,
Synclaire

05:52.797 --> 05:55.097
we got to get this plan
in motion.

05:55.164 --> 05:56.530
What you guys up to?

05:56.597 --> 05:59.730
In the effort to get Max
in to the Halloween spirit

05:59.797 --> 06:02.837
we paid a visit to the best
novelty shop in the city.

06:02.904 --> 06:04.304
The Screamatorium.

06:06.170 --> 06:09.370
Unfortunately, we couldn't get
the one gag we really wanted.

06:09.437 --> 06:12.104
Yeah, it turns out you need
a permit for explosives.

06:14.837 --> 06:16.837
Regine!

06:23.970 --> 06:26.404
This is the first
and the last time

06:26.470 --> 06:29.237
I'll let you go
to the costume store without me.

06:30.370 --> 06:32.137
Little Bo Peep? I'm saying.

06:33.937 --> 06:36.637
What? They told me
it was Patti LaBelle.

06:38.837 --> 06:41.270
Well, it's too late
to change it now.

06:41.337 --> 06:43.137
Look, Scooter needs us
to stop by his house

06:43.204 --> 06:44.470
and pick up a parrot.

06:45.504 --> 06:46.870
Don't ask.

06:46.937 --> 06:49.704
‐ How are we supposed to get in?
‐ I have a key.

06:49.770 --> 06:52.037
Hmm. He must really trust you.

06:52.104 --> 06:54.504
That's why I'm leaving you
in the car.

07:05.077 --> 07:07.277
I thought I told you
to stay in the car.

07:07.344 --> 07:08.710
Dressed like this?

07:08.777 --> 07:10.444
But how'd you get past
the security guard?

07:11.310 --> 07:12.577
Dressed like this.

07:14.677 --> 07:16.644
Let me find his bird
so we can raise up out of here.

07:16.710 --> 07:18.644
Look, don't touch anything.

07:23.377 --> 07:26.644
"Tito Jackson unplugged."

07:29.977 --> 07:32.110
Nice, Scooter!

07:32.177 --> 07:34.610
[music on player]

07:38.644 --> 07:43.277
'Regine, I told you
to sit your Egyptian ass down.'

07:48.744 --> 07:50.810
[telephone ringing]

08:03.284 --> 08:04.617
What are you doing?

08:04.684 --> 08:06.250
(parrot)
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

08:06.317 --> 08:07.484
Oh, it talks.

08:07.550 --> 08:09.150
(parrot)
Oh, it talks. Oh, it talks.

08:09.217 --> 08:10.950
Shut up! Who cares, man.

08:11.017 --> 08:13.517
Scooter's getting a fax, and,
and, and if it's urgent

08:13.584 --> 08:16.250
and he misses it,
you'll never forgive yourself.

08:16.317 --> 08:18.550
Regine, I don't like looking
through Scooter's stuff.

08:18.617 --> 08:19.984
Not through, at!

08:22.484 --> 08:23.884
You need to peek this, bo.

08:26.184 --> 08:29.584
Well, you, you,
you kill me being that nosy.

08:29.650 --> 08:32.049
"Dear, Scooter,
thanks for last night.

08:32.116 --> 08:33.484
"I'll never forget it.

08:33.549 --> 08:35.150
See you tonight. Love, Y."

08:35.217 --> 08:36.417
Mm.

08:38.317 --> 08:40.017
So?

08:40.083 --> 08:41.517
So?

08:41.583 --> 08:44.250
Khadijah, you've got to read
between the lines.

08:45.484 --> 08:48.117
[seductive]
"Dear, Scooter."

08:50.550 --> 08:52.250
That means love slave.

08:54.050 --> 08:56.250
"I had a wonderful time
last night.

08:56.317 --> 08:58.217
[gasps]
I'll never forget it."

09:00.924 --> 09:03.524
Translation, you've got
the stamina of a Greek God.

09:05.057 --> 09:06.557
You need help.

09:06.624 --> 09:09.024
Look, just because some woman
sends Scooter a fax

09:09.090 --> 09:11.190
doesn't mean
he's cheating on me.

09:12.424 --> 09:13.690
It doesn't!

09:14.990 --> 09:16.224
I have to go to the bathroom.

09:16.290 --> 09:18.090
My bloomers are starting
to creep me.

09:21.424 --> 09:23.657
Okay, well, you know,
look, he's my friend too

09:23.724 --> 09:25.090
and I don't want
to believe it either

09:25.157 --> 09:27.990
but, uh, if you want me
to ignore it, hey, I will.

09:28.057 --> 09:31.957
You know me, girl.
I am not one to butt in.

09:32.024 --> 09:35.490
Look what I found under the sink
next to the roach motel.

09:37.690 --> 09:39.757
Belongs to a woman
in her mid to late 20s.

09:39.824 --> 09:41.790
[gasps]

09:41.857 --> 09:44.490
‐ Approximately a 135 pounds.
‐ What?

09:46.057 --> 09:47.424
Judging from the length
of the chain

09:47.490 --> 09:50.090
she's about five feet,
seven inches.

09:53.357 --> 09:54.890
He's a dead man.

09:56.157 --> 09:57.424
(parrot)
Dead man! Dead man!

10:04.938 --> 10:07.138
Wow, Cleopatra.

10:07.205 --> 10:08.605
Queen of the Nile.

10:08.672 --> 10:10.038
[laughs]

10:10.105 --> 10:12.005
Khadijah, what a great costume.

10:12.072 --> 10:15.438
‐ Do you have my bird?
‐ Oh, I got your bird, alright.

10:16.972 --> 10:20.072
Ooh, you really told him
with the bird line, Khadijah.

10:21.172 --> 10:22.838
‐ Regine, this is not the place.
‐ Fine.

10:24.338 --> 10:27.805
Come on, ladies,
let's win this costume contest.

10:34.338 --> 10:35.805
‐ Hey, Mel.
‐ Yes.

10:35.872 --> 10:37.172
Why isn't anybody in costume?

10:37.238 --> 10:39.438
We're donating the money
we were to spend on costumes

10:39.505 --> 10:42.638
to a children's charity.
Didn't you get my message?

10:45.172 --> 10:47.505
Oh, listen,
if you feel uncomfortable

10:47.572 --> 10:48.772
you don't have to stay.

10:48.838 --> 10:51.538
Oh, no, no, no.
We wouldn't dream of leaving.

10:51.605 --> 10:54.772
Yeah, we want to meet
all your friends.

10:57.438 --> 11:00.678
Alright, girl, Ms. Fax has got
to be up in here somewhere.

11:02.178 --> 11:03.178
I'm gonna go sniff her out.

11:05.512 --> 11:07.812
‐ Hey. Hey, ladies.
‐ Hi.

11:07.878 --> 11:10.845
Khadijah, this is Jennifer,
Chelsea and Tammy.

11:10.912 --> 11:12.312
This is my girlfriend, Khadijah.

11:12.378 --> 11:15.478
Terrence, you didn't tell us
you had a girlfriend.

11:15.545 --> 11:18.045
Yes. Yes, yes, yes.

11:20.478 --> 11:23.478
In fact, they've known each
other since they were babies.

11:23.545 --> 11:26.578
Yes, their, their mothers
even bathed them together.

11:26.645 --> 11:27.945
[sniffing]

11:30.145 --> 11:33.745
So, I guess nobody told you guys
about the costume thing, huh?

11:33.812 --> 11:34.778
[both laughing]

11:34.845 --> 11:36.112
Yeah. Yeah.

11:37.645 --> 11:43.312
Well, I must say, Terrence,
you make a very handsome pirate.

11:43.378 --> 11:45.712
Thank you. You're looking
very lovely yourself.

11:45.778 --> 11:47.112
‐ Thank you.
‐ Alright.

11:47.178 --> 11:49.312
[chuckles]
Nice meeting you all.

11:50.745 --> 11:52.478
Excuse me, can I talk to you
for a minute, Terrence?

11:53.845 --> 11:55.945
I hate to drag you away
from your little fan club

11:56.012 --> 11:59.245
but am I interrupting
your flirting?

11:59.312 --> 12:00.545
Flirting?

12:00.612 --> 12:05.252
"I must say, Terrence, you make
a very handsome pirate."

12:06.685 --> 12:09.252
"You're looking
very lovely yourself."

12:09.318 --> 12:11.218
‐ Please.
‐ That was just small talk.

12:11.285 --> 12:13.885
Okay, so, how come no one
knows you have a girlfriend?

12:13.952 --> 12:15.818
Everybody at Flavor
knows you're my man.

12:15.885 --> 12:18.585
That's 'cause I visit you there.
You've never been to my office.

12:18.652 --> 12:21.118
Well, in fact,
where is my office, Khadijah?

12:21.185 --> 12:22.552
Your office is..

12:25.052 --> 12:26.318
...somewhere in Manhattan.

12:27.585 --> 12:29.685
Now, you just make sure
everybody knows

12:29.752 --> 12:31.352
that I'm your girlfriend.

12:31.418 --> 12:33.285
Excuse me.

12:35.318 --> 12:39.052
Okay, I found 12 women
who smell like this.

12:39.118 --> 12:41.385
So I gotta narrow it down.

12:41.452 --> 12:43.985
Look, Regine, just give it a
rest. I'm not even in the mood.

12:44.052 --> 12:45.818
No, no, no, no, girl,
now come on.

12:45.885 --> 12:47.885
All I gotta do is just
get some writing samples

12:47.952 --> 12:49.752
and then match it to the fax.

12:52.885 --> 12:53.952
Here's a pen.

12:54.018 --> 12:55.885
Yes, I'mma work,
I'mma work it.

13:09.125 --> 13:10.458
I don't understand it.

13:10.525 --> 13:12.192
Between the flashin'
pumpkin light

13:12.258 --> 13:14.492
and the pop‐lockin' skeleton

13:14.558 --> 13:15.792
you figured
that the little tykes

13:15.858 --> 13:18.325
would be beatin' our door down
by now.

13:18.392 --> 13:19.558
Well, look at the bright side.

13:19.625 --> 13:21.758
You can always use these
pumpkin cookies as coasters.

13:23.625 --> 13:26.692
What kinda society is it
where little fresh‐faced kid

13:26.758 --> 13:28.325
can't paint themselves
with blood

13:28.392 --> 13:29.658
and wander through the streets?

13:30.658 --> 13:32.392
It's just a shame.

13:34.192 --> 13:37.625
Hey, Max, why don't you have
some of our Halloween trail mix?

13:41.125 --> 13:43.125
[Synclaire screaming]

13:45.325 --> 13:46.692
A rubber cockroach.

13:47.925 --> 13:50.325
Better keep him
off the plastic fruit.

13:50.392 --> 13:52.892
Dang! What does it take
to scare you, girl?

13:53.792 --> 13:56.725
[Max screaming]

14:00.698 --> 14:02.798
What are you doing here, Satan?

14:04.432 --> 14:06.998
Just checking on
some of my best work.

14:09.032 --> 14:10.765
And what are you two
supposed to be?

14:10.832 --> 14:14.132
Eh, well, you see, I wanted
to go as Bonnie and Clyde

14:14.198 --> 14:15.832
and she wanted to go
as the bride of Frankenstein

14:15.898 --> 14:16.998
and Frankenstein, so..

14:17.065 --> 14:19.665
So, we're the bride of
Frankenstein and Clyde.

14:21.332 --> 14:24.498
‐ Thought you had a date, man.
‐ Oh, it's not until midnight.

14:24.565 --> 14:26.665
Oh, that's when
today turns into tomorrow

14:26.732 --> 14:29.832
and you are unemployed
for yet another day. Uh‐hoo.

14:31.898 --> 14:34.965
Can I offer someone some punch?
Uh, Max?

14:35.032 --> 14:37.132
Mmm, thanks.

14:42.765 --> 14:44.532
[screaming]

14:46.898 --> 14:49.198
Alright, who lost their eye?

14:51.298 --> 14:52.665
Got to hand it to you, Max.

14:52.732 --> 14:55.732
You tougher
than tool belt leather.

14:55.798 --> 14:58.265
Oh, hit that.

14:58.332 --> 15:00.272
[screaming]

15:01.738 --> 15:02.972
Damn!

15:03.038 --> 15:06.072
Give it a rest, Overton.
Look at her.

15:07.505 --> 15:08.905
We should be scared.

15:09.838 --> 15:11.005
[doorbell ringing]

15:11.072 --> 15:12.738
Synclaire, the trick‐or‐treaters
are here.

15:12.805 --> 15:14.172
The trick‐or‐treaters are here!

15:14.238 --> 15:17.138
Will you get the door?
I got the treats. Go, go, go!

15:17.205 --> 15:19.872
Go, go, go,
open, open, open. Go.

15:19.938 --> 15:22.372
(all)
Trick or treat!

15:22.438 --> 15:24.272
Come on in, kids.

15:24.338 --> 15:26.272
[all screaming]

15:31.772 --> 15:34.705
[instrumental music]

15:37.738 --> 15:41.205
Hey, I want you to meet
Khadijah, my girlfriend.

15:45.738 --> 15:50.705
Hey, Jeanine, I'm just dancing
with my girlfriend, Khadijah

15:50.772 --> 15:52.272
over here.

15:55.672 --> 15:59.272
Hey, you! Girlfriend! Mine!
Dancing!

16:02.745 --> 16:04.145
Scooter, you made your point.

16:04.212 --> 16:05.812
No, I just want
to let everyone know

16:05.878 --> 16:08.612
that the babe in the bloomers
is my girl.

16:08.678 --> 16:10.612
(parrot)
My girl! My girl!

16:12.078 --> 16:14.878
I guess you just missed
the funnyman tonight, huh?

16:14.945 --> 16:18.278
Excuse me? Terrence, I have been
lookin' for you all night.

16:18.345 --> 16:21.778
Now we really need to get
together. When can I call you?

16:21.845 --> 16:23.878
Well, why don't you
just fax him?

16:23.945 --> 16:25.178
Pardon me?

16:25.245 --> 16:27.012
I'm sure
she has your fax number.

16:27.078 --> 16:30.245
Everyone has your fax number.
Give her the fax number.

16:30.312 --> 16:31.312
Who are you?

16:31.378 --> 16:34.312
(all)
Khadijah. His girlfriend.

16:36.512 --> 16:38.878
She better recognize.

16:38.945 --> 16:40.345
Come here.

16:40.412 --> 16:42.445
Alright, what is up with you?

16:42.512 --> 16:45.178
‐ Don't you work with any men?
‐ What's that supposed to mean?

16:45.245 --> 16:46.312
‐ What's‐‐
‐ Yo, yo, yo!

16:46.378 --> 16:47.578
Are ya'll talkin' about the fax?

16:47.645 --> 16:49.412
What's with the faxing?

16:49.478 --> 16:53.045
Exhibit A. Can you explain this?

16:53.112 --> 16:54.378
Regine, I'll handle it
from here.

16:55.778 --> 16:58.545
Oh, okay. It's like that? Okay.

17:00.452 --> 17:01.885
But I just want you to know

17:01.952 --> 17:03.152
this is the last time
I dressed up

17:03.218 --> 17:05.752
like Cleopatra and sniffed
strangers for you.

17:09.752 --> 17:11.718
Well, Terrence,
can you explain this fax?

17:11.785 --> 17:13.818
I had dinner
with one of our artists.

17:13.885 --> 17:16.085
Who just had to send you
a little love note?

17:16.152 --> 17:18.318
Ooh, I'm sorry, I forgot
to tell her after dinner

17:18.385 --> 17:20.718
"Whatever you do, don't fax me."

17:22.452 --> 17:24.652
Do you see amusement on my face?

17:24.718 --> 17:26.117
Look, I'm good company.

17:26.185 --> 17:28.051
If you weren't so busy
all the time, you'd know that.

17:29.318 --> 17:31.652
I've been busy with work.

17:31.718 --> 17:34.452
I don't know what the hell
you've been busy with.

17:34.518 --> 17:36.352
Not exactly your scent.

17:36.418 --> 17:38.752
That's a promotional item
for our new group, Jasmine.

17:38.818 --> 17:39.818
Now, I was gonna give it to you

17:39.885 --> 17:41.985
but it smells
like funky corn chips.

17:43.718 --> 17:45.452
You expect me to believe that?

17:45.518 --> 17:47.352
[laughs]
You don't have to believe that.

17:47.418 --> 17:49.185
There's a whole banner
right behind you.

17:49.252 --> 17:50.685
[scoffs]

17:55.552 --> 17:56.885
Oh.

17:56.952 --> 17:59.385
And what were you doing
going through my apartment?

17:59.452 --> 18:00.592
Look, that's not the issue.

18:00.658 --> 18:02.058
‐ Then what is?
‐ 'Uh‐‐'

18:02.125 --> 18:03.525
Khadijah, you don't trust me.

18:03.592 --> 18:05.192
Now why would I give you keys
to my apartment

18:05.258 --> 18:07.592
if I was gonna have other women
going through there?

18:07.658 --> 18:10.392
Because that's what you would be
expectin' me to expect you

18:10.458 --> 18:12.025
to be expectin' of me.

18:15.558 --> 18:20.892
Well, look, with the fax and all
these, the perfume and the women

18:20.958 --> 18:23.222
and Regine buzzin'
all up in my ear

18:23.289 --> 18:24.789
wh‐what was I supposed to think?

18:24.856 --> 18:28.156
Khadijah, you shouldn't have to
think about it. You should know.

18:28.222 --> 18:29.856
You are all the woman I need.

18:33.522 --> 18:35.822
For you to say
somethin' like that

18:35.889 --> 18:37.956
with me lookin' like this.

18:40.122 --> 18:42.056
That's the sweetest thing
I've ever heard.

18:45.556 --> 18:48.622
‐ Let's get out of here.
‐ I'll race you to the car.

18:48.689 --> 18:51.389
Loser towel dries
the winner for a week.

18:52.922 --> 18:55.989
Khadijah, one more thing.

18:56.056 --> 18:57.589
Will you wear
the bonnet tonight?

19:04.196 --> 19:07.429
This Halloween
has been one big bust.

19:07.496 --> 19:11.296
Didn't scare Max. Linus missed
the Great Pumpkin again.

19:12.996 --> 19:16.162
And we're stuck
with all these treats.

19:16.229 --> 19:19.096
Well, candy‐corn , if you
hadn't scared the kids away

19:19.162 --> 19:21.196
maybe they would've
gotten some treats.

19:22.262 --> 19:24.029
Perhaps, funnel cake.

19:25.429 --> 19:27.362
But if we had went
to the Halloween parade

19:27.429 --> 19:31.196
like I suggested, maybe we both
might have had a good time, huh?

19:31.262 --> 19:34.662
Maybe, nut cluster, but we both
decided to stay home

19:34.729 --> 19:36.862
and treat the children.

19:36.929 --> 19:40.262
Oh, corn‐tray, cinnamon crisp..

19:44.296 --> 19:48.129
For it was your idea
to serve the whack snacks.

19:50.262 --> 19:52.196
Those were your idea.

19:53.429 --> 19:54.696
So they were.

19:56.429 --> 19:58.629
I'm sorry.

19:58.696 --> 20:01.736
But let's not waste what little
time we have left on Halloween

20:01.802 --> 20:05.036
so, let's have some fun.
Where's the sunshine, hon?

20:05.102 --> 20:06.469
He he, say please.

20:07.269 --> 20:08.969
Oh, brother.

20:09.036 --> 20:10.902
I got to agree with you
on that one, Max.

20:10.969 --> 20:12.202
‐ I got you now.
‐ Oh, oh, oh!

20:12.269 --> 20:13.602
‐ Bring out the sunshine.
‐ Oh, oh, no, you don't!

20:13.669 --> 20:15.602
‐ Come on.
‐ No, you don't! No, you don't!

20:15.669 --> 20:17.269
(Synclaire)
No, no, no! No, no, no!

20:17.336 --> 20:18.702
(Synclaire)
'Oh, oh, I got you now.'

20:18.769 --> 20:20.369
'Oh, Obie, look out!'

20:20.436 --> 20:21.702
'Obie!'

20:22.702 --> 20:24.769
Oh, my God!

20:24.836 --> 20:26.369
Obie, Obie, are you okay?

20:26.436 --> 20:28.369
He's in shock.
Synclaire, call 911.

20:28.436 --> 20:29.569
Max, get me a blanket
and a pillow.

20:29.636 --> 20:31.269
Blanket and a pillow.
Blanket and a pillow.

20:31.336 --> 20:33.936
‐ Now!
‐ I'm getting it! I'm gettin it!

20:34.002 --> 20:36.436
Okay. Okay,
the ambulance is on the way.

20:36.502 --> 20:38.536
Blanket and a pillow.
Blanket and a pillow.

20:38.602 --> 20:39.702
Alright,
what do you want me to do?

20:39.769 --> 20:41.469
Come on, man,
what do you want me to do?

20:41.536 --> 20:44.436
I want you to represent me,
'cause I'm gonna sue somebody.

20:44.502 --> 20:46.102
[laughing]

20:48.636 --> 20:51.002
[screaming]

20:53.102 --> 20:54.369
Yes!

20:55.202 --> 20:57.102
I oughta whup your ass.

20:58.736 --> 21:01.409
You should've seen the look on
your face.

21:01.476 --> 21:03.642
You got a butt‐kicking comin'
too.

21:05.176 --> 21:07.009
Ooh, you gonna beat me too, Max?

21:08.976 --> 21:10.542
[laughing]

21:10.609 --> 21:12.776
I only wish that Khadijah
and Regine had been here

21:12.842 --> 21:14.242
to see this.

21:14.309 --> 21:18.209
They'll get a chance to see it,
over and over again

21:18.276 --> 21:21.376
'cause you're on Obie camera.
Gotcha!

21:22.209 --> 21:24.309
[Synclaire laughing]

21:29.942 --> 21:32.842
[all laughing]

21:35.442 --> 21:37.376
Aren't you guys
tired of watching that?

21:37.442 --> 21:39.642
Oh, no. The night is young.

21:41.576 --> 21:43.509
(Kyle)
'He's in shock.
Synclaire, call 911.'

21:43.576 --> 21:44.809
'Max, get me a blanket
and a pillow.'

21:44.876 --> 21:46.276
‐ 'Blanket and a pillow.'
‐ Blanket and a pillow.

21:46.342 --> 21:48.776
Blanket and a pillow.

21:48.842 --> 21:51.209
I love the way Max runs. Oh.

21:51.276 --> 21:53.376
Oh, Obie, here comes
your part again. Go, go, go.

21:53.574 --> 21:54.874
'I'm gonna need you
to represent me'

21:54.941 --> 21:56.308
'cause I'm gonna sue somebody.'

21:56.374 --> 21:57.474
Yeah.

21:57.541 --> 21:58.741
(Synclaire)
'Rewind it. Rewind it.'

21:58.808 --> 22:00.681
‐ 'Rewind it..'
‐ Nope. Nope.

22:00.748 --> 22:02.048
Nope, that's it.

22:02.114 --> 22:05.714
Admit it, Max,
Obie almost scared you to death.

22:05.781 --> 22:09.348
No, Regine, you're wrong.
He did scare me to death.

22:20.814 --> 22:21.814
<i>(Regine)</i>
<i>Woo‐hoo.</i>

22:21.881 --> 22:23.148
<i>[Regine chuckles]</i>
