Johns Hopkins has a
world-class medical program!

00:37.204 --> 00:39.471
Villanova is America's
#1 tech school!

00:39.473 --> 00:41.940
Miami of Ohio has
hardly any black people!

00:41.942 --> 00:43.942
Donna, can we please go now?

00:43.944 --> 00:46.178
Being in school at night
is for janitors.

00:46.180 --> 00:47.546
I know, Cleveland.

00:47.548 --> 00:49.848
But Roberta is going to college
in a couple of years

00:49.850 --> 00:51.150
and I'm worried
about her future.

00:51.152 --> 00:53.485
You know, we could save
ourselves a bunch of time

00:53.487 --> 00:55.654
and just check out
the safety schools.

00:55.656 --> 00:57.256
(spits)

00:58.658 --> 00:59.992
Tufts good.

00:59.994 --> 01:01.093
Come to school.

01:01.095 --> 01:03.095
Major in fire.

01:03.097 --> 01:05.764
Hey,"Don't Ask, Don't Tell,"
how's the wars goin'?

01:05.766 --> 01:06.999
(chuckles)
Just kidding.

01:07.001 --> 01:08.934
Thank you for
your service.

01:08.936 --> 01:10.502
Would your son or daughter
be interested

01:10.504 --> 01:12.304
in a career in
the armed forces?

01:12.306 --> 01:14.039
Ha!
What are we, poor?

01:14.041 --> 01:15.941
(chuckles)
You funny.

01:15.943 --> 01:17.843
But seriously,
thank you.

01:21.014 --> 01:24.116
Hey, that's my
alma mater, Stat!

01:24.118 --> 01:26.185
(braying)

01:26.187 --> 01:28.153
(braying)

01:28.155 --> 01:30.022
(both braying)

01:30.024 --> 01:32.991
I take it you'll be attending
our homecoming this weekend.

01:32.993 --> 01:34.460
Homecoming's this weekend?!

01:34.462 --> 01:36.128
Oh, I am there!

01:36.130 --> 01:37.863
In spirit, but not actually.

01:37.865 --> 01:40.332
I promised my wife
I'd clean out the garage.

01:41.835 --> 01:46.038
(clocks ticking)

01:46.040 --> 01:47.673
(clocks cuckooing)

01:47.675 --> 01:49.341
(sighs)

01:55.882 --> 01:57.015
College night?

01:57.017 --> 01:58.851
I'm not going to college.

01:58.853 --> 01:59.985
Rihannadidn't go.

01:59.987 --> 02:01.954
Kim Kardashiandidn't go.

02:01.956 --> 02:04.123
"Hide your kids,
hide your wife" didn't go

02:04.125 --> 02:06.091
and they're all
doing just fine.

02:06.093 --> 02:07.826
My parents is the same way.

02:07.828 --> 02:10.996
They be all, "Yo, Gabriel,
go to college like we did

02:10.998 --> 02:13.932
and become professors
like we are" and Shabbat.

02:13.934 --> 02:15.534
I'm like, "Blap dat."

02:15.536 --> 02:18.003
Yo, Ro, I wish I could
kiss you right now.

02:18.005 --> 02:19.138
Then why don't you?

02:19.140 --> 02:21.106
'Cause your 'rents just landed.

02:21.108 --> 02:23.375
Hello, Mrs. Tubbs.
Papa Smurf.

02:23.377 --> 02:26.512
I told him I'm Papa Smurf.
Kid's a moron.

02:26.514 --> 02:29.047
Have a smurfy day!
A'ight.

02:29.049 --> 02:32.584
Roberta, you need to start
thinking about college.

02:32.586 --> 02:35.954
So, this weekend, you and I
are going on a college tour.

02:35.956 --> 02:37.856
What?
I'm not doing that.

02:37.858 --> 02:39.491
This weekend is QUAMMPF.

02:39.493 --> 02:41.960
The Queercore Underground
Afrobeat Microhouse

02:41.962 --> 02:43.862
Memphis Soul Post-Metal
Folk Festival?!

02:43.864 --> 02:45.130
I don't think so.

02:45.132 --> 02:47.966
19 teenage girls
got killed there last year,

02:47.968 --> 02:51.136
according to the <i>CSI</i> episode
that was loosely based on it.

02:51.138 --> 02:52.871
I'm more of a <i>Columbo</i> guy.

02:52.873 --> 02:54.940
(imitating Columbo):
Hey, where's those criminals?

02:54.942 --> 02:57.042
Cleveland, go drink
some water and lie down.

02:57.044 --> 02:58.510
I don't need no water.

02:58.512 --> 03:01.180
(increase TV volume)
As for you, young lady,
you most certainly are

03:01.182 --> 03:03.415
going on that
tour with me.
No, I'm not!

03:03.417 --> 03:05.250
No, I'm not.
I'm going to QUAMMPF!
"L"? There's never any "L"s.

03:05.252 --> 03:06.985
The hell you are!
I don't need
a college tour!

03:06.987 --> 03:09.087
I'm not even going
to college!
"Love's Labor's Lost!"

03:09.089 --> 03:10.255
Cleveland, turn that off!

03:10.257 --> 03:12.291
Roberta says she's
not going to college!

03:12.293 --> 03:13.859
Rihannadidn't go to college.

03:13.861 --> 03:15.594
Kim Kardashian
didn't go to college.

03:15.596 --> 03:16.962
Cleveland,
those girls have talent

03:16.964 --> 03:19.264
and/or pornography
to fall back on.

03:19.266 --> 03:20.766
What is Roberta gonna do?

03:20.768 --> 03:23.969
Well, if she learns about shoes,
she could sell shoes...

03:23.971 --> 03:25.637
People need shoes...

03:25.639 --> 03:27.339
Shoes.

03:30.276 --> 03:32.844
Well, Larry, thanks
for running lines with me,

03:32.846 --> 03:34.213
but I blew the audition.

03:34.215 --> 03:36.582
You'd think they'd never seen
a naked 14-ye...

03:37.150 --> 03:38.150
Larry?

03:38.152 --> 03:39.985
Larry?

03:40.853 --> 03:42.020
Larry?

03:48.094 --> 03:49.428
Where are you, Larry?

03:49.430 --> 03:51.029
(clocks ticking)

03:55.868 --> 03:58.337
Larry?
Larry, where are you?

03:58.339 --> 04:00.172
(washer buzzes)

04:00.174 --> 04:02.874
Please, no.

04:04.177 --> 04:05.911
Please, no.

04:07.347 --> 04:11.083
(screams)

04:11.085 --> 04:13.752
What have you done
to Larry, woman?!

04:13.754 --> 04:16.121
Oh, I finally washed
that nasty thing.

04:16.123 --> 04:18.423
It was all covered
in dirt and sweat and drool.

04:18.425 --> 04:21.159
And peanut butter
and toothpaste and tears!

04:21.161 --> 04:23.095
That was all part
of his essence,

04:23.097 --> 04:25.097
and you washed it away!

04:25.099 --> 04:28.267
(sniffs) I don't even know
who you are anymore!

04:28.269 --> 04:32.104
On the bright side, at least
you finally did some laundry.

04:35.041 --> 04:37.542
I can't believe I can't
go back for homecoming

04:37.544 --> 04:40.846
just 'cause I have to clean out
the stinky old garage.

04:40.848 --> 04:43.515
(sighs)
Look what's happened to my life.

04:43.517 --> 04:46.685
It's all cleaning the garage
and flushing the toilet,

04:46.687 --> 04:49.021
and then it's off to bed
by a quarter to 10:00

04:49.023 --> 04:50.922
because if I don't get
nine hours,

04:50.924 --> 04:53.258
I can't walk or use my left arm.

04:53.260 --> 04:55.761
Of course, I wake up
a few times a night

04:55.763 --> 04:59.498
from my acid reflux.
(grunting burp)

04:59.500 --> 05:01.533
Gus, some bread?

05:01.535 --> 05:03.001
What's happened
to you?!

05:03.003 --> 05:05.037
My best days
are behind me.

05:05.039 --> 05:07.172
Not like when
I was in college.

05:07.174 --> 05:09.474
I was the B.M.O.C.:

05:09.476 --> 05:11.810
Big Mustache on Campus.

05:11.812 --> 05:14.012
Here's that slice of bread
you asked for, Cleve...

05:14.014 --> 05:15.981

05:15.983 --> 05:18.050
Hi...

05:20.687 --> 05:30.262
♪

05:35.935 --> 05:37.636
The answer is four.

05:37.638 --> 05:38.537
That is incorrect.

05:38.539 --> 05:40.872
Don't care.
College!

05:42.108 --> 05:46.044
ALL:
B.M.O.C! B.M.O.C!

05:46.046 --> 05:47.946
B.M.O.C!

05:47.948 --> 05:49.581
CLEVELAND:
B.M.O.C!

05:49.583 --> 05:51.383
B.M.O.C!

05:53.119 --> 05:54.619
My legs have gotten gross.

05:54.621 --> 05:57.189
Too bad you can't just take
Roberta on that college trip

05:57.191 --> 05:59.024
because then you could go
to homecoming,

05:59.026 --> 06:01.360
and that sounds exactly
like what you need

06:01.362 --> 06:02.494
to feel young again.

06:02.496 --> 06:04.296
Lester, that's brilliant!

06:04.298 --> 06:06.164
Gus, a beer for Lester!

06:06.166 --> 06:07.232
No.

06:13.973 --> 06:18.043
Donna, I'm taking Roberta
on that college tour.

06:18.045 --> 06:19.711
You better than I?!

06:19.713 --> 06:22.114
(laughing haughtily)

06:22.116 --> 06:23.448
I mean it!

06:23.450 --> 06:25.083
Look, Roberta doesn't want
to go to college

06:25.085 --> 06:28.019
because you're making it
sound like it's full of nerds.

06:28.021 --> 06:31.089
And when I went to college,
we hated nerds.

06:31.091 --> 06:33.325
Even made them start
their own fraternity.

06:33.327 --> 06:35.927
Now, I'm not gonna lie:
they did get their revenge--

06:35.929 --> 06:38.130
several times,
once in paradise.

06:38.132 --> 06:39.998
Nerds!

06:40.000 --> 06:42.134
But why would she listen
to you and not me?

06:42.136 --> 06:45.470
Because teenage girls
are subhuman parasites

06:45.472 --> 06:47.539
who must feast on their
mothers' misery to survive.

06:47.541 --> 06:48.940
True.

06:48.942 --> 06:53.145
After this weekend, I guarantee
she'll want to go to college.

06:53.147 --> 06:54.646
You know, Cleveland,
you're right.

06:54.648 --> 06:56.314
I don't want to ruin college
for her.

06:56.316 --> 06:57.983
She's all yours.

06:57.985 --> 07:00.786
Just make sure she goes
to her admissions interview.

07:00.788 --> 07:03.255
I promise.
Hey, Roberta!

07:03.257 --> 07:06.491
ROBERTA: What?!
I'm taking you on your
college tour this weekend!

07:06.493 --> 07:09.161
The hell you are!
I'm going to QUAMMPF.

07:09.163 --> 07:12.764
So you can go
(bleep) yourself!

07:12.766 --> 07:14.166
If I could do that to myself,

07:14.168 --> 07:17.135
I wouldn't be going anywhere
this weekend!

07:17.137 --> 07:18.670
(laughing)

07:24.610 --> 07:26.878
Junior, what are you doing
bumping around?

07:26.880 --> 07:28.280
It's "this o'clock."

07:28.282 --> 07:31.082
I can't sleep because Larry
doesn't smell right.

07:31.084 --> 07:34.853
He smells like Snuggles,
the gay fabric softener bear.

07:34.855 --> 07:37.823
Just 'cause I's clean don't mean
I don't like it dirty.

07:37.825 --> 07:38.957
Hmm!

07:38.959 --> 07:40.826
A'ight, Snuggle.

07:40.828 --> 07:41.993
Man, look at yourself.

07:41.995 --> 07:43.328
You're better than this,

07:43.330 --> 07:46.298
14 and still sleeping
with a stuffed animal.

07:46.300 --> 07:48.934
It's time you learn
to sleep on your own.

07:48.936 --> 07:52.437
Now get on that demoralized
mattress and go to sleep.

07:52.439 --> 07:54.840
I don't know
if this is going to work.

07:54.842 --> 07:56.107
Who will watch the door

07:56.109 --> 07:58.109
to make sure a black vampire
doesn't come in?

07:58.111 --> 08:00.045
Why you gotta
specify black, Junior?

08:00.047 --> 08:01.980
Look, I'm scared, okay?

08:01.982 --> 08:05.016
Shh-shh. It's gonna be fine.

08:05.018 --> 08:06.585
Rallo will watch over you.

08:08.921 --> 08:13.191
(humming "Amazing Grace")

08:19.165 --> 08:21.166
Now, remember,
Roberta's interview

08:21.168 --> 08:22.467
is at 8:00
tomorrow morning.

08:22.469 --> 08:24.135
Donna, stop worrying.

08:24.137 --> 08:27.005
This is going to be the best
weekend of Roberta's young life.

08:27.007 --> 08:29.875
Damn right it is.

08:34.947 --> 08:36.248
(starts engine)

08:37.583 --> 08:39.451
CLEVELAND:
Roberta, the first thing
you need to know

08:39.453 --> 08:41.686
about college is on this tape.

08:41.688 --> 08:44.155
("Two Princes"
by Spin Doctors plays)
CLEVELAND: ♪ Yeah...

08:44.157 --> 08:47.125
♪ One, two, princes
kneel before you... ♪

08:47.127 --> 08:49.427
(burping)

08:49.429 --> 08:51.863
Roberta, give me that bread
out the glove box!

08:57.637 --> 09:00.372
This is it, Roberta!
College.

09:00.374 --> 09:02.974
Mm.
Back on cam.

09:02.976 --> 09:06.044
Ooh, look. There's
a campus security officer.

09:06.046 --> 09:08.179
He has no weapon
and no legal authority.

09:08.181 --> 09:09.981
You can do anything
you want to him.

09:09.983 --> 09:11.082
Watch.

09:11.084 --> 09:12.250
Hey!

09:12.252 --> 09:13.952
Don't make me warn you.

09:13.954 --> 09:17.255
(laughs) How much you make
a year, fake cop?

09:17.257 --> 09:19.090
$65,000.

09:19.092 --> 09:20.091
(deep voice):
Really?

09:20.093 --> 09:22.160
(tower bell rings)

09:22.162 --> 09:23.428
See this, Roberta?

09:23.430 --> 09:25.096
This is the College Grill.

09:25.098 --> 09:26.965
We used to just
call it "the Grill."

09:26.967 --> 09:28.967
We'd say, "Meet you
at the Grill."

09:28.969 --> 09:30.769
Used to come in
for grilled cheese...

09:30.771 --> 09:34.005
...at midnight.
Can you handle that?

09:34.007 --> 09:35.941
Do you still serve
grilled cheeses here?

09:35.943 --> 09:38.109
No, the campus
banned trans fats.

09:38.111 --> 09:39.210
(deep voice):
Really?
(bell tower rings)

09:39.212 --> 09:41.046
Yo, Ro.

09:41.048 --> 09:43.582
Wow, Cleveland,
you've inspired me

09:43.584 --> 09:45.283
to explore the campus
on my own.

09:45.285 --> 09:48.086
So... meet back here
in a day and a half?

09:48.088 --> 09:50.288
Uh-uh, nooo!

09:50.290 --> 09:52.157
I promised your mother
I would make you

09:52.159 --> 09:54.793
want to go to college
and get you to that interview.

09:54.795 --> 09:57.262
Now, let's check out
my old fraternity!

09:57.264 --> 09:58.296
Yay!

09:58.298 --> 10:01.266
Brew bros!

10:04.937 --> 10:07.706
So, I've decided
to kill myself.

10:07.708 --> 10:10.175
Is that why you
didn't buy any food?

10:10.177 --> 10:12.210
ROBERTA:
Kappa Alpha Kappa.

10:12.212 --> 10:14.279
Ah, the KAK house.

10:14.281 --> 10:16.414
Where my KAKs at?!

10:16.416 --> 10:18.283
Cleveland Brown, class of '92,

10:18.285 --> 10:21.252
Keg Return Chair, gettin'
your deposits back, y'all!

10:21.254 --> 10:23.989
The B.M.O.C. is back!

10:23.991 --> 10:25.957
Dude, get a load
of this lose-bag.

10:25.959 --> 10:28.093
Yeah, let's mess
with that scum-hog.

10:28.095 --> 10:29.527
College slang!

10:30.630 --> 10:33.198
Wow, you're the
Cleveland Brown?

10:33.200 --> 10:34.633
In pers.

10:34.635 --> 10:35.934
We hoped you'd come
this weekend!

10:35.936 --> 10:36.935
I'm Brad.

10:36.937 --> 10:38.703
That's Murphy,
and this is Fart.

10:38.705 --> 10:39.471
(farts)

10:39.473 --> 10:40.372
Awesome.

10:40.374 --> 10:42.007
You showed up just in time.

10:42.009 --> 10:44.509
We're just about to choose
this year's coolest alum,

10:44.511 --> 10:46.044
or "Plum Alum."

10:46.046 --> 10:48.913
And if you win,
you'll get your name engraved

10:48.915 --> 10:49.913
on the wall of fame

10:49.915 --> 10:53.618
where the most legendary KAKs
are immortalized forever.

10:53.620 --> 10:56.755
The Wall of Fame?!
Wow!

10:56.757 --> 10:58.289
What do I need
to do to win?

10:58.291 --> 10:59.658
You'll compete
against other alums

10:59.660 --> 11:02.794
in a series of events:
beer pong, keg stands,

11:02.796 --> 11:05.530
keg sits, keg squa,
beer pound...

11:05.532 --> 11:07.766
Easy! I could be
the Plum Alum!

11:07.768 --> 11:09.601
Roberta, you could see me
as Plum Alum.

11:09.603 --> 11:11.036
I got Plum Alum
in me, right?

11:11.038 --> 11:12.504
You do!

11:12.506 --> 11:16.007
You've got to go for it,
even if it takes several hours

11:16.009 --> 11:17.942
and you completely forget
about me.

11:17.944 --> 11:21.012
I'll just be sitting right here
on this gross couch.

11:22.515 --> 11:23.615
'Sup?

11:23.617 --> 11:25.250
(laughs)

11:28.521 --> 11:32.323
Dude, I was this close
to sealing the deal.

11:32.325 --> 11:34.926
(sighs)

11:34.928 --> 11:38.830
Ba-blap, ba-blap.
Ba-blap, ba-blap.

11:38.832 --> 11:40.532
(quacking):
QUAMMPF. QUAMMPF.

11:40.534 --> 11:42.801
QUAMMPF. QUAMMPF.

11:42.803 --> 11:46.538
Finally, we can get
our QUAMMPFs on.

11:46.540 --> 11:49.841
(moaning)

11:49.843 --> 11:50.942
Gabriel?

11:50.944 --> 11:52.944
Professor and Professor
Friedman.

11:52.946 --> 11:57.015
(gasps):
You convinced Gabriel
to come on the college tour?

11:57.017 --> 11:59.250
I bet you Rebecca Goldman
couldn't have done that.

11:59.252 --> 12:01.419
Maybe we are better off
with this one.

12:01.421 --> 12:03.488
Your parents
teach here at State?

12:03.490 --> 12:04.923
Why didn't you tell me?

12:04.925 --> 12:07.192
I can't keep track of where
everybody's professin'.

12:07.194 --> 12:10.128
Come on. We'll give
you the grand tour.

12:10.130 --> 12:12.864
Well, let's get
this party started!

12:12.866 --> 12:18.036
First stop: an introductory
linguistics seminar-izzle.

12:18.038 --> 12:19.871
Eh, Gabriel?

12:19.873 --> 12:21.005
Is that one?

12:21.007 --> 12:23.274
Yeah, that's one.

12:28.247 --> 12:30.081
♪ Brush 'em till they bleed

12:30.083 --> 12:31.483
♪ Swallow down the blood

12:31.485 --> 12:33.618
♪ Use some Listerine

12:33.620 --> 12:34.953
(screams)

12:34.955 --> 12:37.388
Oh, yeah, I should
brush my teeth, too.

12:42.294 --> 12:43.962
Well, good night.

12:43.964 --> 12:45.997
My first night flying solo.

12:45.999 --> 12:47.999
Who's sleeping all by himself?

12:48.001 --> 12:49.367
Who's a big boy?

12:49.369 --> 12:50.368
I am.

12:50.370 --> 12:52.771
I'm a dangerously big boy.

12:52.773 --> 12:54.606
Thanks for being there
for me, Rallo.

12:54.608 --> 12:57.108
Hey, you don't need
that jive-ass leopard

12:57.110 --> 12:58.777
when you got me.

13:01.847 --> 13:03.615
What the...?

13:03.617 --> 13:05.250
Junior's room?

13:05.252 --> 13:08.419
Ah, fool kidnapped me
from my own bed.

13:08.421 --> 13:10.588
Oh, my God, I'm the new Larry!

13:10.590 --> 13:12.423
Junior, wake up!

13:12.425 --> 13:13.758
Wake up!

13:13.760 --> 13:14.993
(grunting)

13:14.995 --> 13:17.295
I thought I'd have
to fall a lot further

13:17.297 --> 13:20.431
before I became a fat man's toy.

13:22.001 --> 13:24.669
(groaning)

13:24.671 --> 13:25.670
(slurping)

13:25.672 --> 13:26.871
Yeah!

13:26.873 --> 13:30.275
Yoga! Yoga! Yoga!

13:30.277 --> 13:32.644
Looks like we
have a winner!

13:32.646 --> 13:34.145
CROWD (chanting):
Plum Alum! Plum Alum!

13:34.147 --> 13:37.081
I'm fine to drive.

13:39.084 --> 13:42.353
Thanks for the tour,
Mr. and Mrs. Professor Friedman.

13:42.355 --> 13:45.490
We better get started on all
this homework you've given us,

13:45.492 --> 13:47.859
even though we don't know
who to turn it in to.

13:47.861 --> 13:49.427
Eh, rip it up
when you're done.

13:49.429 --> 13:52.497
It's just busywork to keep
your ding-dong in your pants.

13:52.499 --> 13:54.632
Well, we better
hurry home.

13:54.634 --> 13:56.334
It's sundown somewhere.

13:56.336 --> 13:58.403
(both laugh)

14:02.141 --> 14:03.775
To the Blapmobile!

14:06.111 --> 14:08.079
I did it!

14:08.081 --> 14:10.915
Wait. Why am I on a donkey?

14:10.917 --> 14:13.852
Ladies and gentlemen,
we present to you

14:13.854 --> 14:16.154
this year's Dumb Alum...

14:16.156 --> 14:17.755
Plum Alum.

14:17.757 --> 14:20.124
No, Dumb Alum.

14:20.126 --> 14:22.927
You dirty
double crossers!

14:25.297 --> 14:26.497
Roberta!

14:26.499 --> 14:27.599
Help me!

14:27.601 --> 14:28.766
(tires screeching)

14:28.768 --> 14:30.335
Cleveland Brown, everybody.

14:30.337 --> 14:32.437
An ass tied to an ass.

14:32.439 --> 14:35.039
CROWD (chanting):
Ass to ass! Ass to ass!
(farting)

14:35.041 --> 14:36.441
No!

14:36.443 --> 14:39.510
It's never good
when I hear that chant.

14:39.512 --> 14:42.814
Ass to ass! Ass to ass!

14:42.816 --> 14:44.249
Ass to ass!

14:47.686 --> 14:49.687
(rock music playing)

14:49.689 --> 14:52.290
(crowd cheering)

14:55.594 --> 14:58.029
(whimpering)

14:58.964 --> 15:00.431
This is QUAMMPF?

15:00.433 --> 15:02.333
This is no better
than QUEEMPF.

15:02.335 --> 15:04.035
The all-female QUAMMPF?

15:04.037 --> 15:06.771
Hey, those are the guys
from Cleveland's frat house.

15:06.773 --> 15:08.039
What are y'all doing here?

15:08.041 --> 15:09.374
It's QUAMMPF.

15:09.376 --> 15:11.976
Every college kid has to go
to every event ever.

15:11.978 --> 15:13.311
Where's Cleveland?

15:13.313 --> 15:14.779
(all laughing)
(farting)

15:14.781 --> 15:16.814
Nah, we duct-taped him
to a donkey,

15:16.816 --> 15:18.249
then sent him off
into the woods.

15:18.251 --> 15:20.251
(all laughing)
(farting)

15:20.253 --> 15:21.252
That sounds dangerous.

15:21.254 --> 15:22.420
Is he all right?

15:22.422 --> 15:23.688
Calm down,
pelvic bone.

15:23.690 --> 15:25.089
He'll be fine.

15:25.091 --> 15:27.926
Yeah, so why don't you send
Malibu's Most Wanted here

15:27.928 --> 15:29.961
back to high school
and party with us tonight?

15:29.963 --> 15:30.962
(groans)

15:30.964 --> 15:33.031
(scoffs)
I don't think so.

15:33.033 --> 15:35.133
I'm going to go
find Cleveland.

15:35.135 --> 15:36.267
Maybe he's in your shirt.

15:36.269 --> 15:37.802
How about I take a look?

15:37.804 --> 15:39.370
Keep your hizzles
off my tizzles!

15:39.372 --> 15:40.371
Oh!

15:40.373 --> 15:42.440
Stay down, Fed.

15:42.442 --> 15:43.708
I was going to.

15:43.710 --> 15:44.976
(neck cracks)

15:44.978 --> 15:46.678
(breasts crack)

15:54.586 --> 15:56.087
(farts)

15:56.089 --> 15:56.955
(grunts)

15:56.957 --> 15:57.989
Where is he?

15:57.991 --> 16:00.258
North end of the woods,
just off campus!

16:00.260 --> 16:01.492
(groaning)

16:01.494 --> 16:03.795
(British accent):
You'll be sorry!

16:03.797 --> 16:05.797
I'm a prince!

16:05.799 --> 16:09.067
(farting)

16:13.639 --> 16:14.706
(grunts)

16:14.708 --> 16:16.107
Come on, Junior. Wake up!

16:16.109 --> 16:18.977
Wake up! Wake up!

16:18.979 --> 16:20.311
(snoring)

16:20.313 --> 16:21.646
Breakfast.

16:21.648 --> 16:22.914
Breakfast?

16:22.916 --> 16:24.415
Finally.
(sighs)

16:24.417 --> 16:26.084
Morning, sunshine!

16:26.086 --> 16:28.920
Another great night of sleep
without Larry the Leopard.

16:28.922 --> 16:30.621
Yeah, 'cause I was Larry!

16:30.623 --> 16:33.024
You grabbed me out of my bed
while I slept!

16:33.026 --> 16:34.959
I was feeling a little lonely.

16:34.961 --> 16:37.028
Wait a minute.
What are these pajamas?

16:37.030 --> 16:38.596
Oh, those are Larry's.

16:38.598 --> 16:39.797
Thought you'd look cute.

16:39.799 --> 16:40.965
And I was right!

16:40.967 --> 16:42.000
(giggles)

16:42.002 --> 16:43.935
Well, that explains
the tail hole.

16:43.937 --> 16:45.937
But you can't just
replace Larry with me!

16:45.939 --> 16:47.705
Rallo, I really don't
need your permission.

16:47.707 --> 16:49.007
What?

16:49.009 --> 16:52.443
You weigh 30 pounds,
and me-- I'm a behemoth.

16:52.445 --> 16:54.278
I'll just throw you
over my shoulder.

16:54.280 --> 16:55.847
Well, I'll
sneak away.

16:55.849 --> 16:56.914
I'll come get you again.

16:56.916 --> 16:58.349
I'll tell Mom!

16:58.351 --> 17:01.152
DONNA (in distance):
I've got my own problems!

17:02.821 --> 17:07.125
Cleveland! Cleveland!

17:07.127 --> 17:09.494
This weekend's
been a disaster.

17:09.496 --> 17:12.163
Let's never set foot on
a college campus again.

17:12.165 --> 17:13.965
Well, I don't know.

17:13.967 --> 17:15.266
That art history lecture

17:15.268 --> 17:17.668
your parents took us to
was pretty cool.

17:17.670 --> 17:18.669
Oh, wow.

17:18.671 --> 17:19.971
Brain freeze.

17:19.973 --> 17:21.873
You actually thinking
about going to college?

17:21.875 --> 17:23.841
Well, maybe.

17:23.843 --> 17:26.010
(whimpering)

17:26.012 --> 17:27.078
Cleveland!

17:27.080 --> 17:28.346
Are you okay?

17:28.348 --> 17:32.083
Roberta, I have taken
this beast as my bride.

17:32.085 --> 17:33.851
Her name is Susan.

17:33.853 --> 17:35.420
We are Democrats.

17:35.422 --> 17:36.654
All right,
we found him.

17:36.656 --> 17:38.356
Let's go home.
No way.

17:38.358 --> 17:40.124
I got to get to my interview.

17:40.126 --> 17:41.025
What?! Why?!

17:41.027 --> 17:42.627
Listen, Federline.

17:42.629 --> 17:45.663
I get good grades, and I haven't
even told my mom this yet,

17:45.665 --> 17:49.033
but I was in the 98th percentile
for the PSATs.

17:49.035 --> 17:50.868
You aced the prostate exam, too?

17:50.870 --> 17:52.970
How comes you never told me
you were smart?

17:52.972 --> 17:55.706
Because I don't want to go
around telling the whole world

17:55.708 --> 17:58.276
I'm a genius
like James Franco.

17:58.278 --> 18:00.611
And I guess I do
want to go to college.

18:00.613 --> 18:02.447
Now, let's get
to that interview.

18:02.449 --> 18:05.183
You ain't never going to
get there by 8:00 a.m., Ro.

18:05.185 --> 18:09.253
This smells very bad.

18:10.255 --> 18:12.457
We're gonna make it.

18:12.459 --> 18:14.092
Yah!

18:21.500 --> 18:23.434
(brays loudly)

18:23.436 --> 18:25.136
CLEVELAND:
Ah! Branches!

18:25.138 --> 18:26.137
Thorns!

18:26.139 --> 18:27.605
Sedimentary rocks!

18:27.607 --> 18:29.507
Geology minor.

18:41.520 --> 18:43.988
(brays loudly)

18:43.990 --> 18:46.023
I'm Roberta Tubbs.

18:46.025 --> 18:50.027
And I am here, on time,
for my interview.

18:50.029 --> 18:52.029
Hi.

18:53.599 --> 18:56.767
Mama, if you need me, I'll be
staying at the Holiday Inn.

18:56.769 --> 18:59.203
Smart. Get those
midweek rates.

18:59.205 --> 19:01.205
Wait, is this about
you and Junior?

19:01.207 --> 19:03.141
You don't understand
what it's like

19:03.143 --> 19:06.344
to have a sweaty fat guy
smother you all night long.

19:06.346 --> 19:09.780
Oh, I do, but I don't get
to go to the Holiday Inn.

19:09.782 --> 19:12.817
We don't run from our problems
in this family.

19:12.819 --> 19:13.985
We trick people.

19:13.987 --> 19:15.419
I'm listening.

19:16.421 --> 19:19.123
Bing-bong. I'll get it.

19:19.125 --> 19:21.659
Well, what have we here?

19:21.661 --> 19:22.927
A leopard.

19:22.929 --> 19:25.596
If that's Larry,
tell him I moved on.

19:25.598 --> 19:27.098
It's not. Look.

19:27.100 --> 19:29.934
The poor thing only has one eye.

19:29.936 --> 19:31.202
Well, who is it?

19:31.204 --> 19:33.104
There's a note.

19:33.106 --> 19:36.941
"I had to go because
I don't smell right anymore.

19:36.943 --> 19:38.976
"Please take care
of my one-eyed son,

19:38.978 --> 19:41.245
"who likes to be held
when he sleeps.

19:41.247 --> 19:43.347
Love, Larry the Leopard."

19:43.349 --> 19:46.918
I guess I could look after him,
even though I have zero years

19:46.920 --> 19:48.853
of stuffed leopard
caretaking experience.

19:48.855 --> 19:51.088
I'll just stick him
in front of the TV

19:51.090 --> 19:52.323
with a bowl
of chocolate milk.

19:52.325 --> 19:53.524
No!

19:53.526 --> 19:55.693
Leopards can't metabolize
chocolate.

19:55.695 --> 19:57.328
And at his age, he should watch

19:57.330 --> 19:59.931
no more than a half-hour
of TV a day!

19:59.933 --> 20:02.333
Well, in that case,
maybe I'll just drown him.

20:02.335 --> 20:04.135
Larry the Leopard
Junior, no!

20:04.137 --> 20:07.538
Oh, wow, we're both Juniors.

20:07.540 --> 20:09.106
(giggles)

20:09.108 --> 20:10.808
I'll keep you safe.

20:10.810 --> 20:13.444
Let me tell you some stories
about your dad.

20:13.446 --> 20:17.014
He was a great friend
before he lost his stink.

20:17.016 --> 20:18.950
But that won't happen to you.

20:18.952 --> 20:22.420
I'm gonna stink
you up real good.

20:22.422 --> 20:25.957
Any day he doesn't snap
and kill us all is a victory.

20:29.928 --> 20:32.597
I just got off the phone
with the admissions officer.

20:32.599 --> 20:34.131
They loved you!

20:34.133 --> 20:35.533
Well, yeah.

20:35.535 --> 20:38.302
I told them about my passion
for higher education,

20:38.304 --> 20:39.971
which I discovered on the trip.

20:39.973 --> 20:41.439
Mm?

20:41.441 --> 20:44.008
And they were impressed
by my ability

20:44.010 --> 20:47.445
to care for my mentally
incapacitated stepfather.

20:47.447 --> 20:48.779
Mm?

20:48.781 --> 20:51.482
So, does this mean you
might want to go to State?

20:51.484 --> 20:52.950
State?! That Podunk school?!

20:52.952 --> 20:54.819
Where I'm going is gonna cost
way more than that.

20:54.821 --> 20:56.087
BOTH:
Really?
