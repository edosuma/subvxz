02:19.572 --> 02:22.075
Hi ya sweetie.

02:22.075 --> 02:24.077
They took the tube
out of his throat.

02:24.077 --> 02:26.079
So now he's breathing
on his own.

02:26.079 --> 02:28.581
He took a lot of damage
to his spleen.

02:28.581 --> 02:30.583
They might have
to take it out.

02:30.583 --> 02:31.584
Oh, my god.

02:31.584 --> 02:32.585
I know.

02:33.086 --> 02:35.088
I'm so scared.

02:35.088 --> 02:36.589
Hey, listen,
listen.

02:36.589 --> 02:39.592
This guy,
he's a tough kid.

02:39.592 --> 02:42.095
If anybody could make it
through something like this,

02:42.095 --> 02:43.596
it's christopher,
you hear me?

02:44.097 --> 02:46.599
You got his holiness,
that's good.

02:46.599 --> 02:49.102
He got shot too,
and survived.

02:49.102 --> 02:50.603
Look!

02:50.603 --> 02:52.605
Look what they did
to my son!

02:52.605 --> 02:54.107
My son, those
sonsofbitches!

02:54.607 --> 02:55.608
Easy, easy.

02:55.608 --> 02:58.111
When you find him,

02:58.111 --> 03:01.114
i want him to suffer,
you hear me, sil?

03:01.114 --> 03:04.117
I want that motherfucker
in agony!

03:04.117 --> 03:07.620
Don't worry, we'll
do the best we can.

03:07.620 --> 03:10.123
Gismonte,
with a "g".

03:10.123 --> 03:12.125
The kid who died,
right?

03:12.125 --> 03:14.127
You never
heard of him?

03:14.127 --> 03:15.628
No.

03:15.628 --> 03:17.630
Well, him and his friend
matthew bevilaqua

03:17.630 --> 03:19.632
ran around
with moltisanti.

03:19.632 --> 03:24.637
Never saw him hanging out
with your buddy christopher?

03:24.637 --> 03:27.140
I thought you wanted
to help your friend.

03:39.152 --> 03:42.155
Hey.

03:42.155 --> 03:44.157
Two days already,

03:44.157 --> 03:46.659
i thought they were gonna
move him out of icu.

03:46.659 --> 03:48.161
I think
he's getting better.

03:48.161 --> 03:49.662
Good, you gotta
pray for him.

03:49.662 --> 03:51.164
Hey, you gotta pray.

03:51.164 --> 03:53.166
We are,
jesus.

03:53.166 --> 03:56.669
Oh, i don't know
what i would do, uncle rich.

03:56.669 --> 03:58.671
I love him
so much.

03:58.671 --> 04:02.675
He's gonna make it.

04:03.176 --> 04:05.178
I don't want
that fuck here.

04:05.178 --> 04:06.179
I told him that.

04:06.679 --> 04:08.181
He's full of
negative energies.

04:08.181 --> 04:10.183
He said he'd only
come back here

04:10.183 --> 04:11.684
if he had something
on matthew.

04:21.694 --> 04:23.696
Start talking.

04:23.696 --> 04:24.697
Back the fuck off.

04:24.697 --> 04:28.201
Alright, what
do you got, rich?

04:28.201 --> 04:31.204
The word is definitely
out on the fucking street

04:31.204 --> 04:33.706
on this
bevilaqua kid.

04:33.706 --> 04:38.711
Tommy biondi from otb
came up with a name,

04:38.711 --> 04:42.215
a dealer named
quickie g.

04:42.215 --> 04:44.717
He's been in the bing
a few times.

04:45.218 --> 04:48.221
Or it might've been
this other prick, fast fatty.

04:48.221 --> 04:51.724
I'm telling you
this won't take long.

04:51.724 --> 04:55.728
I'll give this
bevilaqua kid five days

04:55.728 --> 04:57.730
before somebody
brings his ass to us

04:57.730 --> 04:59.232
to score points.

04:59.232 --> 05:01.734
My brother
was in this hospital,

05:01.734 --> 05:03.736
the bill was
75 pages long.

05:03.736 --> 05:07.740
Eight dollars
for an aspirin.

05:07.740 --> 05:11.744
So, did you hear about
ralph and mary rutaldo?

05:11.744 --> 05:13.246
No, what happened?

05:13.246 --> 05:15.748
You know ralphie has had
his brazilian goomar for years.

05:15.748 --> 05:17.250
She's a dancer,
right?

05:17.250 --> 05:21.254
She just gave birth
to ralph's baby,
a c- section.

05:32.765 --> 05:34.767
Hey.

05:34.767 --> 05:37.270
Why don't you try
and get some sleep?

05:37.270 --> 05:38.271
Why?

05:38.771 --> 05:40.273
Why?

05:40.273 --> 05:46.779
Tomorrow's gonna be
another rough day,
that's why.

05:46.779 --> 05:48.781
I don't think i'm gonna
sleep tonight.

05:48.781 --> 05:50.283
Is this light
gonna bother you?

05:50.783 --> 05:52.785
No.

05:52.785 --> 05:59.292
Goodnight.

05:59.292 --> 06:02.295
Tony?

06:02.295 --> 06:04.797
I love you, tony.

06:05.298 --> 06:07.800
I don't want
anybody getting hurt.

06:08.301 --> 06:10.303
Not me,
not the kids,

06:10.303 --> 06:11.804
not you.

06:11.804 --> 06:14.307
Carmela, i can't do one of
these tearful things

06:14.307 --> 06:16.809
till 5:00
in the morning tonight,
i just can't.

06:16.809 --> 06:21.314
Not tonight.

06:21.314 --> 06:25.818
Did you hear
about ralphie rutaldo?

06:25.818 --> 06:27.820
What about him?

06:28.321 --> 06:31.824
That brazilian
he keeps on the side?

06:31.824 --> 06:33.326
Yeah?

06:33.326 --> 06:35.328
She had a baby.

06:35.328 --> 06:37.830
And christopher's
in the hospital,
this is on your mind now?

06:37.830 --> 06:39.832
Maybe it
has to do with

06:39.832 --> 06:42.335
the "ck one"
stinking up your shirt
last wednesday night.

06:42.335 --> 06:43.836
It's over,
months ago!

06:43.836 --> 06:45.338
Yeah, right.

06:45.338 --> 06:46.839
"Yeah, right", what?
I told you i cut it off!

06:46.839 --> 06:49.342
Listen tony, if you're gonna
keep doing what you do,

06:49.342 --> 06:52.345
at the very least
i want you to get a vasectomy.

06:52.345 --> 06:54.347
You want me
to do what?

06:54.347 --> 06:55.848
Let's get real,
tony.

06:55.848 --> 06:57.850
Do you have any idea
what a bastard child

06:57.850 --> 06:59.352
would do
to this family?

06:59.352 --> 07:01.854
You ever think about the shame
your children would feel?

07:01.854 --> 07:03.356
You're putting us
all at risk.

07:10.363 --> 07:12.865
I had her
tested for aids.

07:12.865 --> 07:15.368
What do you
think i am?

07:57.410 --> 08:02.415
Code blue icu 3,
code blue icu 3.

08:12.925 --> 08:14.927
No, oh my god,
chrissy!

08:14.927 --> 08:16.929
He's gonna die!

08:16.929 --> 08:18.431
He'll be okay.

08:18.431 --> 08:21.434
They said he was
gonna get better!

08:21.934 --> 08:23.436
No!

08:23.436 --> 08:25.438
No, let go
of me!

08:25.438 --> 08:28.941
No, no!

08:36.448 --> 08:38.451
Yeah.

08:39.952 --> 08:41.453
What?

09:01.474 --> 09:03.976
How is he?

09:03.976 --> 09:07.480
His heart stopped.

09:07.480 --> 09:09.982
They're working
their asses off on him.

09:09.982 --> 09:11.484
Alright.

09:11.484 --> 09:15.988
Well, we gotta
stay positive, right?

09:15.988 --> 09:20.493
We gotta
give him that.

09:20.493 --> 09:22.995
Positive vibes only.

09:54.026 --> 09:56.529
Gentle and merciful
lord jesus,

09:56.529 --> 10:00.032
i want to speak to you now
with an open heart,

10:00.032 --> 10:02.034
with an honest heart.

10:02.034 --> 10:05.538
Tonight i ask you
to take my sins

10:05.538 --> 10:09.542
and the sins of my family
into your merciful heart.

10:10.042 --> 10:13.045
We have chosen this life
in full awareness

10:13.045 --> 10:15.548
of the consequences
of our sins.

10:15.548 --> 10:18.551
I know that christopher's life
is in your hands...

10:18.551 --> 10:23.556
and his fate is your will.

10:23.556 --> 10:26.559
I ask you humbly
to spare him.

10:26.559 --> 10:30.062
And if it is your will
to spare him,

10:30.062 --> 10:33.566
i ask that you deliver him
from blindness

10:33.566 --> 10:37.069
and grant him vision.

10:37.069 --> 10:41.073
And through this visio
n may he see your love...

10:41.073 --> 10:46.078
and gain the strength
to carry on in service
to your mercy.

10:52.585 --> 10:55.087
In the name of the father,
the son,

10:55.087 --> 11:01.093
and the holy spirit, amen.

11:01.093 --> 11:03.596
Really, if i had
any reservations at all

11:03.596 --> 11:05.097
i'd suggest
we move him right away.

11:05.097 --> 11:07.600
But this is the best trauma unit
in the tri- state area.

11:07.600 --> 11:09.101
I'm up on
all the ratings.

11:09.101 --> 11:13.105
Thanks, hesh.

11:13.105 --> 11:18.110
There's no
news yet.

11:18.611 --> 11:21.113
Tony, it's
dr. Rueben.

11:21.113 --> 11:24.116
Mr. Moltisanti suffered
cardiac and respiratory arrest

11:24.617 --> 11:27.119
due to internal bleeding,
he was resuscitated.

11:27.119 --> 11:29.121
The bleeding was
brought under control

11:29.121 --> 11:30.623
and he's now
in stable condition.

11:31.123 --> 11:33.626
What was the duration
of the arrest?

11:33.626 --> 11:35.127
About a minute.

11:35.127 --> 11:36.629
Is he stil
l intubated?

11:36.629 --> 11:38.631
They're removing
the ventilator as we speak.

11:39.131 --> 11:40.633
What the fuck you two
talking about?

11:40.633 --> 11:42.134
The worst is over

11:42.635 --> 11:45.137
but he was clinically dead
for about a minute.

11:45.638 --> 11:48.140
Doctor, can i go in
and see him?

11:48.140 --> 11:49.141
No, he's gonna
be in post- op

11:49.642 --> 11:50.643
for about
four or five hours,

11:50.643 --> 11:53.145
and then he asked
to speak to mr. Gualtieri.

11:53.646 --> 11:54.647
Me?

11:54.647 --> 11:57.650
He asked twice for
you and mr. Soprano.

12:10.663 --> 12:12.164
Christopher.

12:12.164 --> 12:15.167
Hey.

12:15.167 --> 12:16.669
I'm sorry, t.

12:16.669 --> 12:18.170
For what?

12:18.170 --> 12:21.173
I know
you're mad at me.

12:21.173 --> 12:24.176
What are you talking about?
I'm not mad at you.

12:24.176 --> 12:27.179
Nobody's
mad at you.

12:27.680 --> 12:30.683
I'm going to hell, t.

12:30.683 --> 12:33.185
You're not going
anywhere but home.

12:33.686 --> 12:35.688
I crossed over
to the other side.

12:36.188 --> 12:37.690
You what?

12:37.690 --> 12:41.694
I saw the tunnel
and the white light...

12:42.194 --> 12:44.697
and i saw
my father in hell.

12:44.697 --> 12:46.198
Get the fuck
out of here.

12:46.198 --> 12:48.701
And the bouncer said
that i'd be there too

12:48.701 --> 12:50.202
when my time comes.

12:50.202 --> 12:51.203
What bouncer?

12:51.704 --> 12:54.707
"The emerald piper",
that's our hell.

12:54.707 --> 12:57.209
It's an irish bar

12:57.209 --> 13:02.214
where it's st. Patrick's day
everyday forever.

13:02.214 --> 13:05.217
Mikey palmice
and brendan filone
were there too.

13:05.217 --> 13:07.219
They were friends.

13:07.219 --> 13:09.722
Those two guys
hated each other.

13:09.722 --> 13:12.224
You gotta relax,
you just need some rest.

13:12.725 --> 13:14.226
They're friends now.

13:14.226 --> 13:16.729
They were playing dice
with two roman soldiers

13:16.729 --> 13:18.731
and a bunch
of the irish guys.

13:18.731 --> 13:20.232
Doesn't make sense.

13:20.232 --> 13:23.235
The irish, they were
winning every roll.

13:23.235 --> 13:26.739
And then mikey gave me
a message for both of you.

13:26.739 --> 13:28.240
A message?

13:28.741 --> 13:29.742
Yeah.

13:30.242 --> 13:34.246
Yeah, he said...

13:34.246 --> 13:37.249
"tell tony and paulie,
3:00."

13:37.249 --> 13:39.251
3:00?

13:39.251 --> 13:42.254
This fucking morphine drip
, i don't think it's working.

13:42.254 --> 13:44.256
I don't feel
a fucking thing.

13:44.256 --> 13:46.258
You gotta be
careful with that.

13:46.258 --> 13:48.260
That was
all he said?

13:48.260 --> 13:49.261
Who?

13:49.261 --> 13:50.763
Mikey,
"3:00"?

13:50.763 --> 13:52.264
Yeah.

13:52.264 --> 13:56.268
What was
he wearing?

13:56.268 --> 13:59.772
C'mon, let's go,
he needs his rest.

13:59.772 --> 14:03.275
He had on a gangster suit,
pinstripe.

14:03.275 --> 14:06.278
Old fashioned style.

14:06.278 --> 14:08.280
Hey...

14:08.280 --> 14:10.282
that was a dream.

14:10.282 --> 14:13.285
Forget about it,
okay?

14:13.285 --> 14:19.792
We're gonna
take you home soon.

14:19.792 --> 14:23.796
Do they know this kid
likes his chemistry set
a little too much?

14:23.796 --> 14:26.799
He's in pain,
what the fuck else
are they gonna do?

14:31.804 --> 14:34.306
What time
was mikey hit?

14:34.306 --> 14:36.809
How the fuck
do i know?

14:37.309 --> 14:38.811
You were there,
weren't you?

14:38.811 --> 14:39.812
It was
in the morning, right?

14:40.312 --> 14:41.814
11:00, 10:00?

14:55.327 --> 14:57.830
Alright, so i cheat--
i used to cheat.

14:57.830 --> 15:01.333
I'm not getting spayed,
end of subject.

15:01.834 --> 15:03.836
You brought up
the vasectomy,

15:03.836 --> 15:05.838
now you don't
want to talk about it.

15:05.838 --> 15:11.844
You asked me
what was going on.

15:11.844 --> 15:17.850
I saw in the news
about a gangland shooting.

15:17.850 --> 15:19.351
Yeah.

15:19.351 --> 15:26.859
Is that your nephew christophe
that you've spoken of before?

15:26.859 --> 15:29.361
In the papers they said
he was in critical condition.

15:29.361 --> 15:31.363
He's gonna be fine.

15:31.363 --> 15:33.866
Have they found the person
that shot him yet?

15:33.866 --> 15:35.868
No...
have you?

15:35.868 --> 15:38.370
I'm not trying to pry into
that part of your life.

15:38.871 --> 15:40.873
I know our deal.

15:40.873 --> 15:45.377
But i've heard you say before
that you love this young man.

15:53.385 --> 15:55.387
Christopher was...

15:55.888 --> 16:01.393
clinically dead
for about a minute.

16:01.393 --> 16:04.897
He thinks he had one of those
near death experiences.

16:04.897 --> 16:07.900
Says he visited hell.

16:08.400 --> 16:10.402
And they told him
he'd be back permanent.

16:10.402 --> 16:12.404
Who's "they"?

16:12.404 --> 16:14.907
It's bullshit,
it was a dream,

16:15.407 --> 16:16.909
combined with
the morphine.

16:17.409 --> 16:19.912
But now he thinks he's gonna
go to hell when he dies.

16:19.912 --> 16:21.413
He's all fucked up
over it.

16:21.914 --> 16:23.415
Do you think
he'll go to hell?

16:23.916 --> 16:24.917
No.

16:30.422 --> 16:32.925
He's not the type
that deserves hell.

16:32.925 --> 16:35.427
Who do you
think does?

16:35.427 --> 16:36.929
The worst people.

16:37.429 --> 16:39.431
The twisted
and demented psychos

16:39.431 --> 16:41.433
who kill people
for pleasure.

16:41.433 --> 16:43.435
The cannibals,
the degenerate bastards

16:43.435 --> 16:44.937
that molest and
torture little kids.

16:45.437 --> 16:46.939
They kill babies.

16:46.939 --> 16:48.440
The hitlers,
the pol pots.

16:48.440 --> 16:50.442
Those are the evil fucks
that deserve to die.

16:50.442 --> 16:52.444
Not my nephew.

16:52.444 --> 16:55.447
What about you?

16:55.447 --> 16:57.950
What?

16:57.950 --> 16:59.451
Hell?

16:59.451 --> 17:02.955
You been
listening to me?

17:02.955 --> 17:04.455
No...

17:04.455 --> 17:06.959
for the same reasons.

17:06.959 --> 17:09.461
We're soldiers.

17:09.461 --> 17:11.463
Soldiers don't
go to hell.

17:11.463 --> 17:13.464
It's war.

17:13.965 --> 17:15.968
Soldiers,
they kill other soldiers.

17:15.968 --> 17:18.470
We're in a situation

17:18.470 --> 17:21.973
where everybody involved
knows the stakes.

17:22.473 --> 17:27.479
And if you're gonna
accept those stakes...

17:27.479 --> 17:29.982
you gotta
do certain things.

17:29.982 --> 17:34.987
It's business,
we're soldiers.

17:34.987 --> 17:36.989
We follow codes...

17:36.989 --> 17:38.991
orders.

17:38.991 --> 17:41.994
So does that justify
everything that you do?

17:41.994 --> 17:43.495
Excuse me,
let me tell you something.

17:43.996 --> 17:45.497
When america opened
the floodgates

17:45.497 --> 17:46.999
and let all us
italians in,

17:46.999 --> 17:49.001
what do you think
they were doing it for?

17:49.001 --> 17:51.003
Because they were trying
to save us from poverty?

17:51.503 --> 17:53.505
No, they did it
because they needed us.

17:53.505 --> 17:56.508
They needed us
to build their cities
and dig their subways

17:56.508 --> 17:58.510
and to
make'em richer.

17:58.510 --> 18:00.012
The carnegies
and the rockefellers,

18:00.512 --> 18:02.014
they needed worker bees
and there we were.

18:02.014 --> 18:04.016
But some of us didn't want
to swarm around their hive

18:04.016 --> 18:05.517
and lose who we were.

18:05.517 --> 18:07.019
We wanted
to stay italian

18:07.019 --> 18:09.521
and preserve the things
that meant something to us.

18:09.521 --> 18:11.523
Honor, and family,
and loyalty.

18:11.523 --> 18:14.526
And some of us wanted
a piece of the action.

18:14.526 --> 18:17.029
We weren't educate
d like the americans.

18:17.029 --> 18:19.031
But we had the balls
to take what we wanted.

18:19.031 --> 18:22.034
Those other fucks,
those other...

18:22.034 --> 18:25.537
the j. P. Morgans,
they were crooks
and killers too,

18:25.537 --> 18:27.039
but that was
a business, right?

18:27.039 --> 18:28.540
The american way.

18:29.041 --> 18:30.542
That might
all be true.

18:30.542 --> 18:32.544
But what do
poor italian immigrants

18:32.544 --> 18:34.546
have to do with you

18:34.546 --> 18:38.550
and what happens every morning
you step out of bed?

18:38.550 --> 18:40.552
What the fuck is this
all of a sudden?

18:40.552 --> 18:42.554
I'm just asking
a question.

18:42.554 --> 18:44.556
Oh, so you're taking
a stand here now.

18:44.556 --> 18:46.558
Huh? You pick here
to make a stand?

18:46.558 --> 18:48.060
After all this time,

18:48.560 --> 18:50.562
telling me that
nothing's my fault

18:50.562 --> 18:52.064
because of
poor parenting.

18:52.064 --> 18:54.066
You pick now to act like
betsy- fucking- ross!

18:54.566 --> 18:56.568
When my nephew's
in the fucking hospital!

18:56.568 --> 18:58.570
He might not
get out!

19:14.086 --> 19:16.588
What, what
3 o'clock again?

19:16.588 --> 19:22.094
Quiet.

19:25.097 --> 19:28.100
My wind chimes?

19:28.100 --> 19:29.601
Sorry, hon.

19:29.601 --> 19:32.604
Don't wake up
my kids, paulie.

19:32.604 --> 19:34.106
Motherfucker.

19:34.106 --> 19:39.111
Baby, you gotta
relax your thoughts.

19:39.111 --> 19:45.617
Whatever christopher saw,
you can't take it personal.

19:45.617 --> 19:49.621
Christopher's
a troubled kid.

19:50.122 --> 19:54.626
Who knows
what's in his heart?

19:54.626 --> 19:56.628
Come.

19:56.628 --> 19:57.629
You're right.

19:58.130 --> 20:01.633
I need to relax
with this.

20:01.633 --> 20:07.139
Let me help you.

20:07.139 --> 20:08.640
That is so weird.

20:09.141 --> 20:10.642
What the fuck
you saying?

20:10.642 --> 20:14.146
3:00?

20:14.146 --> 20:16.648
Kenny and i were supposed
to be married at 1:00

20:16.648 --> 20:19.151
in the fountainbleu room
at the roman gardens.

20:19.151 --> 20:23.155
Mikey and jo- jo had
the bella vista room
booked for 3:00.

20:23.155 --> 20:25.657
But the bella vista room
is smaller and has no windows.

20:26.158 --> 20:28.160
A week
before the wedding

20:28.160 --> 20:31.163
mikey saw the bella vista room
and flipped out!

20:31.163 --> 20:33.165
He almost killed
the events manager.

20:33.665 --> 20:35.667
So mikey and jo- jo
got the fountainbleu

20:35.667 --> 20:38.670
and kenny and me wound up
in the bella vista room

20:38.670 --> 20:41.673
at 3:00.

21:08.700 --> 21:09.701
Fuck.

21:10.202 --> 21:12.204
Just trying to
tidy up the place.

21:12.204 --> 21:15.707
Go back to sleep.

21:15.707 --> 21:17.709
Tidying up?

21:18.210 --> 21:20.212
How you doing?

21:20.212 --> 21:22.714
I'm doing.

21:22.714 --> 21:24.216
I'll tell ya...

21:24.216 --> 21:29.721
i'm still baffled by
this 3:00 thing though.

21:29.721 --> 21:35.227
I wish i had
more for you, paulie,
but that's all he said.

21:35.227 --> 21:37.729
Let me ask you
a question.

21:37.729 --> 21:39.231
Yeah?

21:39.231 --> 21:41.733
That bouncer
that sent you back,

21:41.733 --> 21:44.736
did he have horns
on his head?

21:44.736 --> 21:46.738
No.

21:46.738 --> 21:49.741
He was just some
big irish goon
in old fashioned clothes.

21:49.741 --> 21:51.743
Did anybody there
have horns

21:51.743 --> 21:55.247
or buds for horns,
those goat bumps?

21:55.747 --> 21:58.250
Paulie, it was
fucking hell, okay?

21:58.250 --> 22:01.753
My father said he looses
every hand of cards he plays.

22:01.753 --> 22:04.256
And every night
at midnight

22:04.256 --> 22:06.758
they whack him the same way
he was whacked in life

22:06.758 --> 22:10.762
and it's painful,
night after night.

22:10.762 --> 22:13.765
Does that sound like
fucking heaven to you?

22:13.765 --> 22:15.267
Was it hot?

22:15.267 --> 22:16.768
Yeah...
i don't know.

22:17.269 --> 22:18.270
What the fuck?

22:18.270 --> 22:20.772
The heat would've been
the first thing you noticed.

22:20.772 --> 22:21.773
Hell is hot.

22:22.274 --> 22:23.775
That's never been
disputed by anybody.

22:24.276 --> 22:25.777
You didn't
go to hell.

22:25.777 --> 22:30.782
You went to purgatory,
my friend.

22:30.782 --> 22:32.784
I forgot
all about purgatory.

22:32.784 --> 22:34.786
Purgatory,

22:34.786 --> 22:39.291
a little detour
on the way to paradise.

22:39.291 --> 22:41.793
How long you think
we gotta stay there?

22:41.793 --> 22:43.795
That's different
for everybody.

22:44.296 --> 22:46.798
You add up all
your mortal sins,

22:46.798 --> 22:48.800
multiply that number
by 50,

22:48.800 --> 22:50.802
then you add up
all your venial sins

22:50.802 --> 22:53.305
and multiply that
by 25.

22:53.305 --> 22:55.307
You add them together,
and that's your sentence.

22:55.807 --> 22:57.809
I figure i'm gonna have to do
about 6, 000 years

22:57.809 --> 23:01.313
before i get
accepted into heaven.

23:01.313 --> 23:04.316
And 6, 000 years is nothing
in eternity terms.

23:04.316 --> 23:06.318
I could do that
standing on my head.

23:06.818 --> 23:11.823
It's like a couple
of days here.

23:11.823 --> 23:14.326
Was i insensitive?

23:14.326 --> 23:19.331
And perhaps,
did i do it deliberately?

23:19.331 --> 23:21.833
Do i hate him?

23:21.833 --> 23:24.836
How often are you
taking the ativan?

23:24.836 --> 23:27.839
Almost every night.

23:27.839 --> 23:31.843
And when else?

23:31.843 --> 23:35.847
Sunday afternoon
i took one.

23:35.847 --> 23:38.850
There's another thing,
i've...

23:38.850 --> 23:43.355
i've been drinking...

23:43.355 --> 23:45.357
alone.

23:45.857 --> 23:47.859
I'm glad
you're telling me.

23:53.865 --> 23:58.870
Part of it is that
i'm afraid.

23:58.870 --> 24:00.872
I've told him
my son is at bard.

24:01.373 --> 24:05.377
Why did you agree to
continue working with him?

24:05.377 --> 24:08.880
I took him back
because i felt it was

24:09.381 --> 24:12.884
a professional
and ethical responsibility
to do so.

24:12.884 --> 24:16.388
Jennifer, i'm not
challenging your ability

24:16.388 --> 24:19.391
or professionalism
, or even your ethics.

24:19.891 --> 24:22.894
Then what are you
challenging?

24:22.894 --> 24:25.397
What you hope to
achieve with this man.

24:25.397 --> 24:27.899
What do you hope
to achieve with me?

24:27.899 --> 24:28.900
No, that's a--

24:29.401 --> 24:34.906
a facile analogy.

24:34.906 --> 24:38.910
I'm living in a moral
never never land
with this patient.

24:38.910 --> 24:43.915
Not wanting to judge,
but to treat.

24:43.915 --> 24:46.918
But now...
i've judged.

24:46.918 --> 24:51.923
I took a position, goddamnit,
and i'm scared.

24:51.923 --> 24:57.929
I feel for you.

25:14.446 --> 25:17.449
You're late.

25:17.449 --> 25:19.951
Does that
go on my record?

25:19.951 --> 25:21.453
I'm talking about
common courtesy here.

25:21.453 --> 25:22.954
I got a life
outside of this too.

25:23.455 --> 25:23.955
Lucky you.

25:23.955 --> 25:25.457
So, what
do you got?

25:25.457 --> 25:26.958
I think he knows.

25:27.459 --> 25:28.460
Knows what?

25:28.460 --> 25:29.961
Or at least suspects.

25:29.961 --> 25:31.463
Who, what?
What are you talking about?

25:31.463 --> 25:33.965
He's been looking
at me different,
these glances.

25:33.965 --> 25:34.966
Glances?

25:35.467 --> 25:36.968
We had sandwiches brought in
the other night,

25:36.968 --> 25:38.970
four with ham, salami,
cappicola,

25:38.970 --> 25:41.473
one eggplant, and the other
with tomato and mozzarella.

25:41.473 --> 25:42.474
Yeah, okay.

25:42.974 --> 25:43.975
That's six total,
there were only five of us.

25:44.476 --> 25:46.478
But tony said
he ordered the eggplant,
but i did,

25:46.978 --> 25:48.980
and i know
for certain he ordered
the tomato/mozzarella.

25:48.980 --> 25:49.981
Maybe he forgot.

25:50.482 --> 25:51.483
No, no,
he never forgets.

25:51.483 --> 25:52.984
So, what's
the bottom line?

25:52.984 --> 25:54.986
He let me eat the eggplant
and he took the tomato.

25:54.986 --> 25:56.488
But there was
a moment.

25:56.488 --> 25:57.489
A glance.

25:57.489 --> 25:58.990
Yeah,
a fucking glance!

25:58.990 --> 26:00.992
This is simple and
i'm gonna help you out here.

26:01.493 --> 26:03.995
You gotta keep in mind
that you're the one
who's different now.

26:03.995 --> 26:06.498
You're the one seeing
through different eyes.

26:06.498 --> 26:07.999
You're the one
with the new attitude.

26:07.999 --> 26:11.002
I know the man
and i see he's the one
who's different with me.

26:11.002 --> 26:12.504
The odds
don't favor it.

26:12.504 --> 26:14.506
Either way
it doesn't matter.

26:14.506 --> 26:15.507
To you.

26:15.507 --> 26:17.509
I wasn't the one
selling heroin, okay?

26:17.509 --> 26:23.014
And i wasn't the one
who got pinned for it.

26:23.014 --> 26:24.516
So what do i do?

26:25.016 --> 26:26.017
What do you do?

26:26.518 --> 26:28.019
You do everything
you can do do.

26:28.019 --> 26:30.021
Do what you do to a girl
that you want to fuck.

26:30.522 --> 26:32.023
Make him love you.

26:47.539 --> 26:49.541
I'll be back first thing
in the morning.

26:49.541 --> 26:52.544
What do you want
for breakfast?

26:52.544 --> 26:55.046
You don't wake up
till lunch, ma.

26:55.547 --> 26:57.549
Tomorrow i'll get up
early, alright?

26:57.549 --> 27:00.552
How about the peppers and eggs
on the round bread?

27:00.552 --> 27:01.553
That sound
s great, ma.

27:02.053 --> 27:04.055
Do you need
more time alone, jo?

27:04.055 --> 27:05.557
No, i'm ready.

27:05.557 --> 27:07.058
Okay, chris.

27:07.058 --> 27:09.060
Bye, ma.

27:17.569 --> 27:20.572
If you want to sleep, it's okay,
i brought a book.

27:20.572 --> 27:23.074
No, i just got up
ten minutes ago.

27:23.074 --> 27:25.076
The painkillers
aren't helping?

27:25.076 --> 27:30.081
No, they're pretty
fucking good.

27:30.081 --> 27:33.084
I want to tell you something,
christopher.

27:33.084 --> 27:37.088
The other night
when your heart stopped...

27:37.088 --> 27:39.090
i walked the hall
to an empty room

27:39.591 --> 27:42.093
and i prayed to jesus
to spare you.

27:42.093 --> 27:44.095
And that
if he would spare you

27:44.095 --> 27:46.097
i asked that
he grant you vision.

27:46.097 --> 27:47.599
Sight.

27:47.599 --> 27:50.602
So that you can see
the way to christ clearly.

27:50.602 --> 27:52.604
Yeah, so?

27:52.604 --> 27:55.106
And he did
spare you.

27:55.106 --> 27:58.109
And you saw,
christopher.

27:58.109 --> 28:00.612
You saw something,

28:00.612 --> 28:03.615
something that none of us
have ever seen.

28:09.070 --> 28:11.573
So what did
he say to you?

28:11.573 --> 28:12.574
Who?

28:12.574 --> 28:13.575
Jesus.

28:13.575 --> 28:15.577
I didn't see jesus.

28:15.577 --> 28:17.579
Tony said that
you saw jesus smiling

28:17.579 --> 28:19.581
and he took you to see
your father in heaven

28:19.581 --> 28:21.583
and then he said
it wasn't your time.

28:21.583 --> 28:23.585
I was in hell,
carmela.

28:23.585 --> 28:24.586
You what?

28:25.086 --> 28:26.588
My father
was in hell

28:26.588 --> 28:29.090
and they said that's where
i'd go when it's my time.

28:29.090 --> 28:32.594
Maybe it was purgatory,
but i don't know.

28:40.101 --> 28:43.104
Then you have to look
at this experience

28:43.104 --> 28:46.107
as an opportunity
to repent...

28:46.107 --> 28:49.611
to change your heart...

28:49.611 --> 28:52.614
to start to walk in
the light of the lord.

28:52.614 --> 28:54.616
You were blessed
by this, christopher.

28:54.616 --> 28:57.619
You were blessed
with a second chance.

28:58.119 --> 29:00.622
I don't know,
carmela.

29:00.622 --> 29:02.123
Well, i do know.

29:02.624 --> 29:06.127
And i am gonna pray
like i did the other night

29:06.127 --> 29:08.630
and i'm gonna pray
every day from now on.

29:08.630 --> 29:13.134
It is not too late for you,
christopher...

29:13.134 --> 29:17.138
if you pray.

29:17.138 --> 29:22.644
Will you pray?

29:22.644 --> 29:27.148
You just have to
follow me.

29:27.148 --> 29:30.151
In the name of the father,
the son,

29:30.151 --> 29:32.654
and the holy spirit.

29:47.168 --> 29:49.170
How was he?

29:49.170 --> 29:50.171
Fine.

29:50.171 --> 29:51.673
The same.

29:58.680 --> 30:01.182
Is there
any news?

30:01.182 --> 30:03.184
No.

30:12.694 --> 30:15.196
So, what?
We're not talking now?

30:15.196 --> 30:18.199
I said what i had
to say, tony.

30:18.199 --> 30:20.201
If you can't
be honest with me,

30:20.201 --> 30:23.204
at least have the balls
to be honest with yourself.

30:23.204 --> 30:24.706
Oh, i got balls.

30:24.706 --> 30:27.208
And as long as i do,
they will remain intact.

30:27.208 --> 30:30.211
If you don't have faith in me,
it's up to you.

30:30.211 --> 30:32.213
You gotta prove it
to yourself first, tony.

30:32.213 --> 30:34.215
To yourself
and god.

30:34.215 --> 30:36.718
You and god,
carmela.

30:36.718 --> 30:38.219
You're only religious
when it suits you.

30:38.720 --> 30:40.722
What is that
supposed to mean?

30:40.722 --> 30:42.223
Come here.

30:50.231 --> 30:52.233
No, no, what is that
supposed to mean?

30:52.233 --> 30:54.235
The pope doesn't even
believe in trojans

30:54.235 --> 30:55.737
and you want me
to get snipped.

30:55.737 --> 30:57.739
Isn't that a little
hypocritical?

30:57.739 --> 31:00.742
Look, tony, i'm thinking o
f my family first, that's all.

31:00.742 --> 31:02.744
Whatever's down here
is god's creation.

31:02.744 --> 31:05.246
Isn't it a sin to undo
the good work he's done?

31:05.747 --> 31:12.253
You should know,
you made a living of it.

31:12.253 --> 31:17.759
You're un- fucking- believable,
you know that?

31:17.759 --> 31:23.765
Look what i made
that living for, hmm?

31:23.765 --> 31:25.767
What the fuck
you doing?

31:25.767 --> 31:26.768
You had dinner
an hour ago.

31:27.268 --> 31:29.270
What the fuck are you
doing to yourself?

31:29.270 --> 31:33.775
Tony,
leave him alone.

31:33.775 --> 31:36.778
I'm supposed to get a vasectomy
when this is my male heir?

31:36.778 --> 31:38.780
Look at him.

31:38.780 --> 31:40.782
Tony, come back here
and apologize!

31:51.292 --> 31:52.794
You're draggin'
me to hell!

31:52.794 --> 31:54.796
What's the matter,
what's the matter?

31:54.796 --> 31:55.797
You're draggin'
me to hell!

31:55.797 --> 31:57.298
Paulie, paulie,

31:57.298 --> 31:58.800
you had
a nightmare, honey.

31:58.800 --> 32:01.302
Mama, somebody was screaming,
i'm scared.

32:01.302 --> 32:03.805
I know, honey,
it's okay, it's okay.

32:03.805 --> 32:05.807
Uncle paulie
had a bad dream.

32:05.807 --> 32:07.809
Mommy!

32:07.809 --> 32:09.310
Come here,
baby.

32:09.811 --> 32:11.312
It's alright,
it's alright.

32:11.312 --> 32:13.314
It's okay,
sweetheart.

32:13.314 --> 32:14.816
I'm putting them
to bed.

32:14.816 --> 32:17.819
Then i'm going home
to sleep.

32:17.819 --> 32:22.824
I don't need to keep
everyone up with this.

32:22.824 --> 32:26.327
C'mon,
let's go to sleep.

32:26.327 --> 32:28.329
Come talk to me.

32:37.839 --> 32:40.341
How much can you
believe in dreams?

32:40.341 --> 32:42.343
Wait, wrong.

32:42.343 --> 32:44.345
Christopher did not
have a dream.

32:44.345 --> 32:47.348
I dream,
i'd make my peace.

32:47.348 --> 32:49.350
He was dead.

32:49.350 --> 32:52.854
Science said he was dead,
science.

32:52.854 --> 32:54.856
You need to
talk to someone

32:54.856 --> 32:57.358
who deals with this kind
of thing professionally.

32:57.358 --> 32:58.860
What kind of thing?

32:59.360 --> 33:00.862
He's in
new york, paulie,

33:00.862 --> 33:03.364
in nyack.

33:03.364 --> 33:05.867
His name is cullen,
he's a psychic.

33:05.867 --> 33:07.869
A psychic, get the fuck
out of here.

33:07.869 --> 33:10.371
He's famous for contacting
dead relatives for people.

33:10.371 --> 33:12.373
He contacted
my dead friend ronnie.

33:12.373 --> 33:13.875
Remember ronnie
with the arm?

33:13.875 --> 33:15.376
Yeah.

33:15.376 --> 33:16.878
He knew all about
the fingers at the elbow

33:16.878 --> 33:18.880
and i didn't
even tell him.

33:18.880 --> 33:20.381
He said,
"johnnie is here."

33:20.381 --> 33:22.383
And i told him
i didn't know any johnnie's,

33:22.383 --> 33:25.887
but then he said,"well, one arm
is shorter than the other.

33:25.887 --> 33:27.889
Does that mean
anything to you?"

33:28.389 --> 33:31.893
Ronnie,
it was ronnie.

33:31.893 --> 33:34.896
Jesus,
fucking creep show.

33:34.896 --> 33:38.399
You got nothing to lose
except the nightmares.

33:44.405 --> 33:47.408
What's up?
Paulie around?

33:47.408 --> 33:48.409
No.

33:48.409 --> 33:49.410
Sil?

33:49.911 --> 33:52.413
What the fuck, i'm here,
you talk to me.

33:52.413 --> 33:53.915
You got something?

33:53.915 --> 33:56.417
You better
remember me, man.

33:56.417 --> 33:58.920
Yeah, i will,
now, you got something?

33:58.920 --> 34:01.422
Alright.

34:01.923 --> 34:03.925
Hacklebarney
state park.

34:03.925 --> 34:06.928
You know where that
"george washington
slept- here- house" is?

34:06.928 --> 34:08.929
Up that road there
is a gray house.

34:08.929 --> 34:10.431
Bevilaqua's there?

34:10.931 --> 34:12.934
20 bucks, baby.

34:24.445 --> 34:26.947
Are you telling me
that's who you are

34:26.947 --> 34:31.452
or that's who he is?

34:31.452 --> 34:36.456
I see.

34:36.456 --> 34:40.460
Right.

34:40.460 --> 34:44.465
The spirit put
him on hold.

34:44.465 --> 34:47.969
Do you take the name
gregory?

34:47.969 --> 34:48.969
My father.

34:48.969 --> 34:50.471
I understand now.

34:50.972 --> 34:54.475
You're gregory,
this is your son.

34:54.475 --> 34:56.476
Is your name
daniel?

34:56.476 --> 34:57.979
Yes.

34:57.979 --> 35:03.985
'Cause i got this image of
daniel in the lion's den.

35:03.985 --> 35:06.487
He says
you found his body.

35:06.487 --> 35:07.989
Oh, my god.

35:08.489 --> 35:09.490
He's sorry.

35:09.991 --> 35:12.493
He knows
how traumatic that was.

35:12.493 --> 35:15.997
He couldn't
take the pain anymore.

35:23.504 --> 35:26.007
Gregory, i'm sorry,
could you repeat that?

35:35.516 --> 35:39.520
He wants you to know
that he was there with you.

35:39.520 --> 35:43.524
And that you
should move on.

35:43.524 --> 35:45.526
Yes, go ahead.

35:55.036 --> 36:01.542
What's
the problem?

36:01.542 --> 36:03.544
What the hell's
the matter?

36:03.544 --> 36:07.048
Please, go on.

36:07.048 --> 36:11.552
He can't hurt you,
you don't have to be afraid.

36:11.552 --> 36:13.554
I understand, yes.

36:19.060 --> 36:21.062
I feel your anger.

36:21.062 --> 36:23.064
Who the fuck
are you talking to?

36:23.564 --> 36:24.565
Charles.

36:24.565 --> 36:26.567
Yes, yes,
you have a son.

36:26.567 --> 36:29.570
You're wit
h your son?

36:29.570 --> 36:32.073
What the fuck?
I don't got no kids.

36:32.073 --> 36:34.075
Oh, sonny.

36:34.075 --> 36:36.077
Pagano?

36:36.077 --> 36:41.082
Kind spirit,
is your name sonny?

36:41.082 --> 36:43.084
Charles pagano.

36:43.584 --> 36:45.586
How the fuck
do you know that?

36:45.586 --> 36:47.588
He says
he was your first.

36:47.588 --> 36:50.091
But i feel many more.

36:50.091 --> 36:50.591
Hey!

36:51.092 --> 36:52.593
That one's
laughing.

36:52.593 --> 36:54.095
Poison ivy?

36:54.095 --> 36:57.098
He wants to know
if it still itches.

36:57.598 --> 37:00.601
Don't fuck with me,
who you been talking to?

37:00.601 --> 37:02.603
I'm afraid i'm gonna have to
ask you to leave.

37:02.603 --> 37:03.604
Why?

37:04.105 --> 37:05.606
What the fuck
are they saying?

37:06.107 --> 37:08.109
You really want me
to say it?

37:08.609 --> 37:11.112
Fuck you
and this bullshit.

37:11.112 --> 37:13.114
That's what this is,
you know.

37:13.114 --> 37:15.616
Satanic black magic,

37:15.616 --> 37:17.118
sick shit!

37:17.118 --> 37:20.121
I'm asking you
to leave, sir.

37:20.121 --> 37:21.622
Yeah?

37:21.622 --> 37:23.624
Fucking queers!

37:37.638 --> 37:43.144
When i made my appointment
, i gave the name ted hughes.

37:43.644 --> 37:45.646
Did you call
from your house?

37:45.646 --> 37:48.149
I'm not a moron, t.

37:48.649 --> 37:51.652
I knew this might
be a scam.

37:51.652 --> 37:57.158
So i called him
from a pathmark.

37:57.158 --> 37:59.660
There's
no denying it.

37:59.660 --> 38:02.163
I'm dragging a bunch of
fucking ghouls around with me

38:02.163 --> 38:06.167
and mikey's
their fucking ringleader.

38:06.167 --> 38:08.169
Alright...

38:08.169 --> 38:10.671
paulie...
think about it.

38:10.671 --> 38:13.174
You whacked a bunch of
heavy hitters in your time,

38:13.674 --> 38:15.676
now, you think they're gonna
all join together

38:15.676 --> 38:17.178
and follow
that prick mikey?

38:17.178 --> 38:19.180
How can you
just sit there?

38:19.180 --> 38:21.182
He warned you
about 3:00 too.

38:21.182 --> 38:22.683
I don't believe
any of this shit.

38:23.184 --> 38:26.687
It doesn't mean
a fucking thing to me.

38:28.189 --> 38:30.191
I was ready to write
the whole thing off

38:30.191 --> 38:32.693
until this psychic mentioned
little sonny pagano.

38:32.693 --> 38:35.196
But, that?
I don't know.

38:35.196 --> 38:38.199
I did this guy
over 30 years ago, t.

38:38.199 --> 38:40.201
How the fuck
did he know that?

38:40.201 --> 38:42.203
Does he know where
matt bevilaqua is?

38:42.203 --> 38:44.705
Did you ask the fucking
ghostbuster that?

38:44.705 --> 38:47.708
'Cause we're out there
breaking our ass
trying to find this kid,

38:47.708 --> 38:49.710
and you're up there
fucking around in nyack.

38:49.710 --> 38:53.214
He deals only
with the dead.

38:59.720 --> 39:01.222
You eat steak?

39:01.222 --> 39:03.224
What the fuck
you talking about?

39:03.224 --> 39:06.227
If you were in india,
you would go to hell for that.

39:06.227 --> 39:08.229
I'm not in india,
what do i give a fuck?

39:08.229 --> 39:10.231
That's what i'm trying
to tell you.

39:10.731 --> 39:12.733
None of this shit
means a goddamn thing.

39:36.757 --> 39:38.259
I'm not hungry.

39:38.259 --> 39:40.761
You mind if i sit here
while i eat?

40:03.284 --> 40:06.287
I'm sorry for talking to you
the way i did.

40:06.287 --> 40:09.790
It's okay.

40:09.790 --> 40:12.793
No...
it's not.

40:12.793 --> 40:15.296
I was wrong.

40:15.296 --> 40:19.800
And i hope you know
i didn't mean it.

40:19.800 --> 40:22.803
I said it'cause
all the anger and frustration

40:23.304 --> 40:30.311
of the last few days
built up inside me and exploded.

40:30.311 --> 40:32.813
There's no excuse
for that.

40:32.813 --> 40:36.317
I gotta learn to
control my emotions
around the people i love.

40:42.323 --> 40:44.325
I think
you're the same way.

40:44.825 --> 40:46.827
I think,
your feelings,

40:47.328 --> 40:49.330
you keep'em inside,

40:49.330 --> 40:55.336
and you and me,
we react without thinking.

40:55.836 --> 40:58.839
That's why i get mad at you,
i see myself in you.

41:04.845 --> 41:08.849
I couldn't ask
for a better son, a. J.

41:08.849 --> 41:14.855
And i mean that.

41:14.855 --> 41:19.360
Thanks.

41:19.360 --> 41:21.862
Want a piece of pizza?

41:34.875 --> 41:37.378
Here.

41:37.878 --> 41:39.380
Pussy's

41:56.397 --> 41:58.399
I been calling you all
over the fucking place.

41:58.399 --> 41:59.900
I'll be
right there.

41:59.900 --> 42:04.405
What's going on?

42:04.405 --> 42:06.407
Nothing.

42:21.922 --> 42:24.425
He's way the fuck out
near morristown,

42:24.925 --> 42:26.427
in hacklebarney
state park.

42:26.927 --> 42:30.431
Over by that "george washington
slept- here- house"?

42:30.431 --> 42:34.935
Yeah.

42:35.436 --> 42:36.937
Give me one.

42:36.937 --> 42:39.440
You don't
have to do this.

42:39.440 --> 42:44.445
Furio and me
are on it.

42:44.445 --> 42:46.447
I want to do this.

42:46.447 --> 42:49.450
Good.

42:49.950 --> 42:50.951
Cut furio loose.

42:51.452 --> 42:53.454
Three's a crowd.

43:17.478 --> 43:19.480
Why don't you just
take it easy?

43:19.980 --> 43:21.982
We just want
to talk to you.

43:21.982 --> 43:24.485
That's all.

43:24.485 --> 43:30.491
It wasn't me,
it was sean,
just sean.

43:30.991 --> 43:32.493
You're shaking.

43:32.493 --> 43:35.996
You're gonna fucking kill me
for something i didn't do.

43:41.502 --> 43:44.004
Don't you think we could've
killed you already,

43:44.004 --> 43:46.507
if we
wanted you dead.

43:46.507 --> 43:48.008
Relax.

43:48.509 --> 43:50.511
We just want
to talk to you.

43:50.511 --> 43:51.512
Tony, it was sean!

43:52.012 --> 43:54.014
You got to believe me,
it was sean, he got nuts!

43:54.014 --> 43:56.517
He said we're being pissed on
and disrespected

43:56.517 --> 43:58.519
and that we should
score points with richie.

43:58.519 --> 44:03.023
But i told him rome wasn't
built in one day!

44:03.524 --> 44:10.030
Anything tony, i'll tell you
anything you want to know.

44:10.531 --> 44:12.032
What did
richie say?

44:12.533 --> 44:14.535
It nothing to do with richie,
he didn't ask for it.

44:15.035 --> 44:16.537
He got mad
when i told him.

44:17.037 --> 44:22.042
Sean did it on spec.

44:22.042 --> 44:23.043
Alright.

44:23.544 --> 44:25.045
Come here.

44:25.045 --> 44:27.047
Come here,
c'mon.

44:32.553 --> 44:35.556
Are you sure nobody else
was involved?

44:35.556 --> 44:38.058
Take a minute,
think it over.

44:38.058 --> 44:40.561
It was sea
n all the way.

44:46.567 --> 44:48.569
Alright.

44:48.569 --> 44:53.073
You're a good kid.

44:53.574 --> 44:55.576
I'm thirsty.

44:55.576 --> 44:59.580
See if we got
something to drink.

44:59.580 --> 45:01.582
What can
i get you?

45:01.582 --> 45:04.084
You want a fanta,
something like that?

45:23.604 --> 45:25.105
How is that?

45:25.105 --> 45:27.608
I mean, you sure
you want a diet drink?

45:27.608 --> 45:30.611
You don't want something
with some sugar in it?

45:30.611 --> 45:32.613
There's only diet.

45:33.113 --> 45:39.119
It's good.

45:39.119 --> 45:45.125
You finished?

45:45.125 --> 45:46.627
Thank you, t.

45:47.127 --> 45:48.629
'Cause that
sugarless motherfucker,

45:48.629 --> 45:51.131
it's the last fucking drink
you're ever gonna have.

45:51.131 --> 45:53.133
I swear to god,
mommy!

45:53.634 --> 45:56.637
Mommy, please, tony,
please!

46:27.167 --> 46:30.170
23 years of donations
to your parish

46:30.170 --> 46:32.172
and this is what
this guy sees hanging over me?

46:32.673 --> 46:34.675
You should've never gone
to a psychic.

46:34.675 --> 46:36.677
It's divination,
it's the devil.

46:36.677 --> 46:40.180
They're completely
unsanctioned by the church.

46:40.180 --> 46:42.683
Psychics are
heretics and thieves

46:42.683 --> 46:44.685
who practice witchcraft.

46:44.685 --> 46:47.688
There's no validity
to anything he told you.

46:47.688 --> 46:50.190
Your problem's
a spiritual matter.

46:50.190 --> 46:51.191
Maybe.

46:51.692 --> 46:53.193
But irregardless,

46:53.193 --> 46:56.196
i should've had immunity
to all of this shit.

46:56.196 --> 46:59.199
I should've been covered
by my donations.

46:59.199 --> 47:01.702
When the organ needed
a reed job who was there?

47:01.702 --> 47:04.204
When the priest
and the alter boys
needed new whites,

47:04.204 --> 47:06.707
who picked up
the tab?

47:06.707 --> 47:08.208
You should've
come to me first

47:08.208 --> 47:10.711
and none of this
would've happened.

47:10.711 --> 47:12.713
But don't worry, paul,
i'm here.

47:12.713 --> 47:14.214
I can help you.

47:14.214 --> 47:16.216
It's too late.

47:16.216 --> 47:19.219
You've been slacking off on me
and you left me unprotected.

47:19.219 --> 47:21.221
I'm cutting you off
for good.

47:21.221 --> 47:23.724
You ain't never gonna see
another dime from me.

48:05.265 --> 48:07.768
A rich man and a poor man
got the same wedding anniversary

48:08.268 --> 48:10.771
and every year they meet
on madison avenue

48:10.771 --> 48:12.773
when their shopping
for their wives.

48:12.773 --> 48:15.275
So the poor man
says to the rich man,

48:15.275 --> 48:16.777
"what'd you buy
your wife this year?"

48:16.777 --> 48:18.779
He says,"i got her
a huge diamond ring

48:18.779 --> 48:20.280
and a brand new
mercedes."

48:20.280 --> 48:22.282
Poor man says,"what'd you
get her both for?"

48:22.783 --> 48:23.784
Rich man says,

48:23.784 --> 48:25.786
"if she don't
like the diamond ring

48:26.286 --> 48:31.792
she can bring it back
in the mercedes
and still be happy."

48:31.792 --> 48:33.293
Rich man says
to the poor man,

48:33.293 --> 48:35.295
"what'd you get
your wife this year?"

48:35.295 --> 48:37.798
He says, i got her
a pair of slippers and dildo."

48:37.798 --> 48:40.801
Rich man says,"what'd you
get her a pair of slippers
and a dildo for?"

48:40.801 --> 48:42.302
And the poor man says,

48:42.302 --> 48:49.810
"she don't like the slippers
she can go fuck herself."

48:49.810 --> 48:53.313
Can i get
another heineken?

48:53.313 --> 48:56.316
Remember the first time
you brought me here?

48:56.316 --> 48:57.818
Yeah,
i remember.

48:57.818 --> 49:01.822
Popped my cherry
that night.

49:01.822 --> 49:04.324
Yeah, seems like
old times.

49:14.835 --> 49:16.336
Puss.

49:21.341 --> 49:24.845
You believe in god?

49:24.845 --> 49:27.848
Yeah, i do, ton',
absolutely.

49:28.348 --> 49:31.351
Works in very mysterious ways
his wonders to perform,

49:31.351 --> 49:32.853
but no doubt,

49:32.853 --> 49:37.357
he's been
very good to me.

49:37.357 --> 49:38.358
Salut.

50:00.881 --> 50:04.885
Hi.

50:04.885 --> 50:07.387
Hey.

50:07.387 --> 50:09.389
How you doing?

50:09.389 --> 50:13.393
Fine.

50:13.393 --> 50:18.398
You?

50:18.398 --> 50:21.401
Good.

50:21.401 --> 50:22.903
Yeah?

51:05.445 --> 51:07.948
I've been thinking...

51:14.454 --> 51:19.960
what?

51:19.960 --> 51:21.461
I'll do it.

51:27.968 --> 51:30.971
You'll do what?

51:30.971 --> 51:32.472
Snip- snip.

51:38.979 --> 51:44.985
I don't want you
to do it, tony.

51:44.985 --> 51:46.486
No, you want me
to do it.

51:46.486 --> 51:48.488
And now
i want to do it.

51:48.488 --> 51:49.990
So...

51:49.990 --> 51:52.492
we'll do it.

51:58.999 --> 52:02.002
I started thinking...

52:02.002 --> 52:07.007
meadow is
leaving soon...

52:07.007 --> 52:11.511
and i may want to
have another baby.

52:12.012 --> 52:16.016
Maybe.

52:16.016 --> 52:19.019
What, are you trying
to drive me fucking crazy?

52:19.019 --> 52:22.022
What's behind
all this?

52:22.022 --> 52:24.024
Ralphie rutald
o and his goomar,

52:24.024 --> 52:25.525
then the vasectomy
, then no vasectomy,

52:25.525 --> 52:29.029
and now this, huh?

52:29.029 --> 52:34.534
Now you don't
want me cut?

52:34.534 --> 52:39.039
Tony...

52:39.039 --> 52:41.541

is you.

52:41.541 --> 52:48.048
That's all
i have ever wanted.

52:48.048 --> 52:53.053
And i want you to be true
and to be mine.

52:53.053 --> 52:56.556

believe me, then fine.

53:03.063 --> 53:07.567

53:07.567 --> 53:12.072
