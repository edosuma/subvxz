WEBVTT

00:11.400 --> 00:12.500
Look at these clowns.

00:12.600 --> 00:14.900
Too molly for their hometown,
so they come here.

00:15.000 --> 00:18.400
I thought Nixon ending the war was
gonna put a stop to this freak show.

00:18.435 --> 00:21.500
This counterculture, Ray,
will one day be looked upon

00:21.535 --> 00:25.800
As a time when a politicized youth rebelled
against the excesses of the Vietnam war,

00:25.835 --> 00:29.465
The excesses of corporate arrogance
and the excesses of racial intolerance.

00:29.500 --> 00:33.565
Yeah, well, the problem is that they do
destructive things

00:33.600 --> 00:37.400
Like blow up national monuments,
burn down induction centers,

00:37.700 --> 00:40.000
Make their own jewelry
out of seashells.

00:44.800 --> 00:46.700
I used to play
in this park as a kid.

00:52.900 --> 00:54.900
You did?
I think this was the place.

00:54.935 --> 00:57.565
hey, 2-B!
Windy?

00:57.600 --> 00:59.400
You come here
to find yourself, too?

01:00.500 --> 01:03.100
Guys,
crime scene's over here.

01:05.000 --> 01:11.074

01:18.300 --> 01:21.100
Looks here like assault
with signs of overkill.

01:21.300 --> 01:24.000
Blunt force trauma to the head.
he was beaten to death.

01:24.500 --> 01:26.600
Whoever it was, we're looking
at some muscle. yep.

01:27.000 --> 01:28.800
Hey, what are you...
got to...

01:31.200 --> 01:32.850
Robert Reeves, jr.

01:32.885 --> 01:34.500
31. Queens address.

01:38.500 --> 01:40.800
Navy. river assault.
look at the insignia.

01:40.835 --> 01:44.200
Let me see that.
Oh, man.

01:44.235 --> 01:45.200
I know, I know.

01:45.900 --> 01:46.600
What?

01:46.800 --> 01:48.665
The last time a military vet
was killed,

01:48.700 --> 01:51.400
The Loot burned this city down
till we found the killer.

01:52.000 --> 01:54.300
Only thing worse in Hunt's book
than killing a cop?

01:54.700 --> 01:55.500
Killing a vet.

01:58.000 --> 01:59.265
Rest in peace, my man,

01:59.300 --> 02:02.000
'Cause you just cinched it
that we ain't gonna.

02:03.200 --> 02:06.900
So... this young man
goes off to Vietnam

02:07.300 --> 02:08.365
To fight for his country.

02:08.400 --> 02:11.000
He returns home
to his family safely,

02:11.035 --> 02:12.600
And he's murdered here.

02:13.400 --> 02:15.700
We're gonna get this
"tough guy" that did this,

02:16.500 --> 02:17.900
And I'm gonna look him
in the face,

02:18.100 --> 02:19.800
And I'm gonna make him
cry for his mother.

02:21.100 --> 02:24.200
What do we got? uh, victim's
name is Robert Reeves,

02:24.235 --> 02:25.900
31, lived in Queens.

02:26.300 --> 02:27.900
Has a wife and a son.

02:28.000 --> 02:29.000
Missing a week.

02:29.900 --> 02:30.900
A wife and a son.

02:32.000 --> 02:34.600
Black berets.
he was a tough S.O.B. to boot.

02:35.000 --> 02:36.000
You served, boss?

02:38.000 --> 02:40.300
I would have, Tyler,
but I burned my draft card

02:40.335 --> 02:42.000
And joined
the Hare Hrishnas instead.

02:43.400 --> 02:45.800
Yeah, I had you down
for some kind of military personnel,

02:45.835 --> 02:49.300
Although I'd have guessed
the guy who ties the blindfold for the fire squad.

02:51.000 --> 02:54.900
I'd like to tie a blindfold
around your butt to keep you from talking.

02:55.100 --> 02:57.700
I want this guy caught.
I want him caught yesterday.

02:57.900 --> 03:01.600
get this guy! get this guy!
get this guy!

03:06.200 --> 03:09.600
What do you mean we can't get the car out of there for 48 hours?
That's ridiculous.

03:09.800 --> 03:12.100
No, no. you stick it
up your--hello?

03:19.000 --> 03:20.365
well, the future may be uncertain,

03:20.400 --> 03:23.800
but one thing's for sure--
things will happen a lot faster there.

03:23.900 --> 03:28.100
you know, someday even paper will be obsolete. 
- Oh. I think that's sad.

03:28.135 --> 03:31.000
Sad? why is it sad?
I like paper.

03:31.300 --> 03:33.700
I like the way it feels between my fingertips.

03:34.900 --> 03:36.665
Well, love to stay and gab,

03:36.700 --> 03:39.100
But I've gotta get back to my important work.

03:39.135 --> 03:41.500
Annie Norris--she puts the "cop" in "copies."

03:41.535 --> 03:44.400
Yes, she does.
Oh, um, speaking of which,

03:44.600 --> 03:46.665
Can you go down to 215th street impound

03:46.700 --> 03:48.465
In the morning, give Reeves' car a once-over?

03:48.500 --> 03:50.400
There may be something in there
to give us a line on this guy.

03:50.600 --> 03:52.465
Really?
You want me to do it?

03:52.500 --> 03:57.100
Who else? Annie Norris-- she puts the "imp" in "impound." 
- All right, let's go, Tyler.

03:57.135 --> 03:59.700
Boss says we can only put off the next of kin for so long.

04:00.100 --> 04:02.665
Saddle up there, No-Nuts. deceased had a kid.

04:02.700 --> 04:05.400
We're gonna need that dewy-eyed
doo-doo that only you do.

04:36.400 --> 04:39.600
I just can't believe it.
two tours of duty.

04:40.900 --> 04:43.700
He hasn't even been home
six months, and now this.

04:44.100 --> 04:48.000
I want to know why.
We're here to answer that question, mrs. Reeves.

04:48.800 --> 04:51.100
What can you tell us about
your husband's state of mind

04:51.600 --> 04:54.100
In the days before he...
before we found him?

04:54.800 --> 05:01.200
Um, he seemed happy to be home, happy to be
back with me again,

05:01.300 --> 05:03.900
happy to be
with our boy Robbie.

05:05.300 --> 05:06.400
So, uh...

05:08.200 --> 05:10.000
So all things considered,
he was happy?

05:10.300 --> 05:13.050
He had good days
and bad days.

05:13.085 --> 05:15.800
Um, he had...
what do you call it?

05:15.900 --> 05:17.300
Re-entry problems.

05:18.000 --> 05:20.900
He had that on certain days.

05:21.100 --> 05:23.800
What about war buddies? did he
keep in touch with any of them?

05:23.835 --> 05:25.700
Was he part of a support group?

05:26.100 --> 05:28.065
Oh, he did get a call recently

05:28.100 --> 05:30.800
from, um, his squad leader John Fisher.

05:31.500 --> 05:33.465
He, uh, seemed excited about that.

05:33.500 --> 05:36.500
Did he give any details about the call? 
No, he didn't.

05:37.900 --> 05:40.000
But I think that he missed
the camaraderie, you know?

05:40.300 --> 05:43.200
For that one afternoon,
he--he had it back.

05:46.300 --> 05:47.265
I hate to ask this,

05:47.300 --> 05:51.100
But do you think there
could have been another woman?

05:52.600 --> 05:53.900
Oh, no.

05:54.900 --> 05:56.700
No, that just wasn't Bob.

05:56.900 --> 05:58.350
No, amongst all of my girlfriends,

05:58.385 --> 05:59.800
I was considered the lucky one.

06:00.400 --> 06:02.565
My friend Marie was very fond
of saying that

06:02.600 --> 06:06.600
A woman could trust no man
except for maybe Bob Reeves.

06:11.400 --> 06:12.100
Excuse me.

06:13.400 --> 06:14.800
A little more grown-up...

06:15.800 --> 06:16.900
Sometimes.

06:22.100 --> 06:23.500
Think the Knicks are
looking good in the finals?

06:24.300 --> 06:25.300
I guess.

06:27.400 --> 06:28.600
I'm sorry about your dad.

06:32.300 --> 06:34.300
You know, my dad took me
to a Knicks game once.

06:34.500 --> 06:35.600
I'll never forget it.

06:35.900 --> 06:40.000
It's one of the last memories I
have of him. so your dad died, too?

06:41.300 --> 06:42.000
No.

06:44.000 --> 06:45.200
No, he just left.

06:47.800 --> 06:50.100
We're gonna find whoever did this to your father.

07:06.400 --> 07:07.100
Sam?

07:10.300 --> 07:13.300
Sorry. he just reminds me of...

07:16.100 --> 07:17.000
Wait a minute.

07:20.300 --> 07:21.000
I'm here.

07:21.500 --> 07:23.200
Yeah, you are.

07:23.300 --> 07:27.800
No, no, I mean... I'm here--out there somewhere.

07:27.835 --> 07:28.965
We moved so much when i was little,

07:29.000 --> 07:32.000
So I-I don't remember where
exactly I lived in the city

07:32.035 --> 07:35.700
In 1973, but I'm here. I have to be.

07:36.200 --> 07:36.865
Sam!

07:36.900 --> 07:38.600
I can't believe I didn't think of this before.

07:39.300 --> 07:40.765
It's so obvious
what I have to do.

07:40.800 --> 07:43.600
This could be the key to getting
back home. 
And what is that Sam?

07:44.800 --> 07:46.400
I need to find myself, Annie.

07:47.400 --> 07:48.800
I need to find myself.

07:50.800 --> 07:52.100
My name is Sam Tyler.

07:52.600 --> 07:55.500
I was in an accident, and I woke up in 1973.

07:56.400 --> 07:58.200
I don't know why or how I'm here,

07:58.900 --> 08:00.100
But whatever has happened,

08:00.200 --> 08:02.365
It's like I've landed on a different planet.

08:02.400 --> 08:06.000
And maybe if I can work out the reason, I can get home.

08:07.000 --> 08:12.000
Corrections and rearranging the lines were made by Isocrate[SubScene]
<-Credit goes to the original subber->

08:18.100 --> 08:20.200
Last time a military veteran was killed?

08:20.500 --> 08:22.800
Marine by the name of Jerry D'angelo.

08:22.835 --> 08:24.000
Served in Korea.

08:24.300 --> 08:26.700
He was bludgeoned to death by a dictionary.

08:26.900 --> 08:31.300
Loot has us harassing every librarian from here to Boston. 
That's why it's important

08:31.335 --> 08:32.900
to keep looking through these files,

08:33.200 --> 08:36.799
Track down every perp who's assaulted a returned veteran
in the past six months.

08:38.299 --> 08:42.299
Tyler? you looking for your people in the police files?

08:43.500 --> 08:46.065
Spaceman, we found the war buddy--Fisher.

08:46.100 --> 08:49.100
he's an uptown fellow, so you and me are going uptown.

08:50.500 --> 08:53.200
Robert was one of
the best navy men I ever met.

08:54.100 --> 08:55.400
Don't mind my saying,

08:56.400 --> 08:59.800
Uh, you look like you're well-acquainted with
the kind of people who could have kept you out of Vietnam.

09:01.600 --> 09:04.300
Well, uh, I love my country, detective.

09:07.600 --> 09:10.365
My father is a highly decorated admiral.

09:10.400 --> 09:13.765
My grandfather helped chase the Kaiser to the Netherlands in world war one.

09:13.800 --> 09:16.400
You might say I was bred for combat.

09:17.000 --> 09:20.800
Mrs. Reeves said you contacted her husband before he died. 
- Yes, i did.

09:20.835 --> 09:22.500
Can you tell us about his state of mind?

09:22.800 --> 09:24.865
Was there anything, uh, troubling him

09:24.900 --> 09:27.200
That he might not share with his wife? 
Well, Robert was tormented

09:27.235 --> 09:32.000
by the lack of respect veterans are getting. 
- How's that?

09:32.500 --> 09:34.865
Well, you know, the hippies, the freaks.

09:34.900 --> 09:37.700
He'd see them in the street. 
One time, they spit on him.

09:37.735 --> 09:40.000
That's what we call the unwelcoming committee.

09:40.500 --> 09:44.900
Our precinct is thick with 'em. 
Flag burning, protesting. They are all traitors.

09:44.935 --> 09:47.900
I mean, every time I go out
to play ball with my kids,

09:48.100 --> 09:50.800
I remember exactly where the shrapnel hit this leg.

09:51.600 --> 09:53.500
I'm reminded of what traitors they are.

09:54.500 --> 09:56.700
Well, they don't see it that way.

09:57.700 --> 10:00.000
They think they're just being patriotic.

10:02.100 --> 10:04.800
They do have a right to peacefully protest.

10:05.700 --> 10:07.400
Come on. that's what we're fighting for over there,

10:07.435 --> 10:09.100
Isn't it? I mean, you take away that right,

10:09.135 --> 10:11.817
We might as well be living in Iran.

10:11.852 --> 10:14.500
Iran? what's Iran got to do with it?

10:18.400 --> 10:21.100
The unwelcoming committee.
The unwelcoming committee.

10:21.300 --> 10:24.200
We've had seven different cases in the last three months

10:24.235 --> 10:26.465
of returning vets getting savagely beaten.

10:26.500 --> 10:30.600
We collared up all seven. 
And all seven were members of a privileged band

10:30.635 --> 10:33.100
of college hippies who avoided the war

10:33.135 --> 10:34.765
With educational deferments.

10:34.800 --> 10:38.000
The unwelcoming committee. 
exactly. cowards, 

10:38.035 --> 10:39.800
taking it out on the very symbol of their cowardice.

10:40.100 --> 10:43.300
We came home to parades, confetti,

10:43.500 --> 10:47.700
drums, bugles and giggling factory girls

10:48.400 --> 10:50.600
All only too happy to share.

10:51.000 --> 10:56.900
Today they come back to getting attacked by the very people they served?

10:59.900 --> 11:01.700
When did it all come apart?

11:03.600 --> 11:05.700
When did it all come apart?

11:10.200 --> 11:11.700
We'll take care of it, boss.

11:16.900 --> 11:19.965
Is this them? 
No, the guys we're looking for are on the top floor.

11:20.000 --> 11:24.100
Take us to Sticker. 
Who are you guys to intrude on our kingdom of awareness?

11:24.300 --> 11:28.700
Shut your bazoo. 1968 called.
it wants its Dashiki back.

11:29.600 --> 11:31.065
Hey, man, you can't comen here.

11:31.100 --> 11:33.500
I need to talk to Sticker, and you're gonna take me to him.

11:33.700 --> 11:37.150
That the radicalization of the anti war movement

11:37.185 --> 11:40.600
Subsumed the spirituality of the narcissist.

11:40.800 --> 11:42.900
But now, man, there's no more war.

11:43.200 --> 11:43.865
So what does that mean?

11:43.900 --> 11:46.800
Does that mean we shouldn't focus on the ecology?
- No!

11:46.835 --> 11:49.700
Does that mean we shouldn't focus on intolerance... 
- No!

11:49.735 --> 11:51.917
Based on race,
Based on gender,

11:51.952 --> 11:54.100
Based on sexual orientation?

11:56.300 --> 11:58.400
Well, well. speaking of intolerance,

11:58.435 --> 12:01.700
Look who it is, detective Ray Carling,

12:01.900 --> 12:05.700
Court jester for the emperor of the 125th precinct.

12:05.735 --> 12:11.800
And he brought along his pet goldfish
and a newcomer who looks like a star but really is out on parole.

12:14.200 --> 12:16.565
A vet gets killed in our precinct,

12:16.600 --> 12:19.700
So we ask ourselves which anti American scum

12:19.735 --> 12:22.765
That we know is most likely to have beaten

12:22.800 --> 12:26.900
A navy man until he killed him?
Well, thank you for thinking of me.

12:26.935 --> 12:29.165
You know this guy?
'Cause you were seen with him.

12:29.200 --> 12:33.500
Of course I was. 
Well, unless god is using you for miracle practice, Kretin,

12:33.535 --> 12:35.617
You're gonna burn like short-order toast

12:35.652 --> 12:37.700
for killing a patriot like Robert Reeves.

12:38.300 --> 12:39.900
Where were you on Saturday night?

12:40.100 --> 12:43.200
Well, I was killing Robert Reeves, of course.

12:45.400 --> 12:46.600
This is a dead end.

12:53.000 --> 12:55.000
I'm gonna go have an ask-around. see you in a while.

12:56.200 --> 12:57.065
All right, Sticker,

12:57.100 --> 12:59.700
Let's go talk like men who hate each other's guts.

13:11.700 --> 13:13.400
Come on, Daisy.
Come on.

13:14.000 --> 13:15.900
It's just one more flight.
Okay.

13:16.200 --> 13:18.300
Hey, 2-B!

13:18.800 --> 13:22.000
What's this, twice in one day
we just run into each other?

13:22.035 --> 13:24.300
Uh, I guess so.

13:24.500 --> 13:27.000
I guess not. I don't believe in coincidences.

13:27.100 --> 13:29.900
I believe in the curlicued whimsy of fate.

13:31.000 --> 13:33.200
Everything is connected.

13:33.235 --> 13:35.217
Come on, 2-B. let's fun up!

13:35.252 --> 13:37.200
Uh, I... just...

13:40.300 --> 13:42.700
If you can't find what you're looking for here,

13:42.735 --> 13:44.900
then you must have already found it.

14:26.735 --> 14:28.900
Yesterday has vanished.

14:30.000 --> 14:32.000
Tomorrow is an illusion--

14:33.200 --> 14:36.100
One that hypnotizes the conventional man

14:36.400 --> 14:39.500
into a deep, deep sleep.

14:40.900 --> 14:42.600
and most never awaken.

14:44.400 --> 14:45.700
Isn't that right, my friend?

14:52.300 --> 14:54.200
I think everything is an illusion.

15:00.100 --> 15:04.400
Your mind is creating every moment of your future

15:05.100 --> 15:07.600
and every moment of your past.

15:08.200 --> 15:11.300
the future is a fever dream,

15:12.500 --> 15:15.100
When now is all there is.

15:15.800 --> 15:18.500
and all there is... is now.

15:18.600 --> 15:19.200
Now.

15:20.900 --> 15:24.800
Maybe 2008 is the illusion, but 1973 is the reality.

15:26.700 --> 15:27.300
What did you say?

15:29.600 --> 15:30.600
What did you say?

15:41.800 --> 15:44.165
Rise and shine

15:44.200 --> 15:46.100
and give gosh
your glory, glory 

15:46.135 --> 15:48.700
Give gosh your glory, glory

15:48.900 --> 15:51.050
Did we... did you...

15:51.085 --> 15:53.165
Just get here? yes.

15:53.200 --> 15:55.500
Ohh. I dropped you off late, or was it early?

15:55.800 --> 15:57.900
Apparently, you stayed up calling people.

15:57.935 --> 15:58.965
I was researching.

15:59.000 --> 16:02.265
Ooh. reseahing what? cop stuff?

16:02.300 --> 16:06.000
I have the teeniest crush on Steve Mcgarrett.

16:06.400 --> 16:06.965
Do you know him?

16:07.000 --> 16:11.100
Yeah, I know who he is. uh,
"Hawaii five-o." "book 'em, Danno."

16:11.500 --> 16:13.900
do you ever say that "book 'em, Danno"?

16:13.935 --> 16:16.467
I would if I worked with a guy named Danno.

16:16.502 --> 16:19.000
You should hire one.
How cool would that be?

16:19.700 --> 16:21.200
What were you researching?

16:22.300 --> 16:24.500
Um, myself,

16:25.200 --> 16:26.100
My parents.

16:26.700 --> 16:28.600
I've already checked the lease records,

16:28.800 --> 16:31.500
The D.M.V , utility companies

16:31.535 --> 16:33.200
And now the phone books.

16:33.400 --> 16:36.200
Problem is, I was, like, 4 years old,

16:36.235 --> 16:37.600
So I can't remember where we...

16:39.100 --> 16:41.300
We move a lot-- moved a lot.

16:41.500 --> 16:44.250
And Tyler'a really common last name.

16:44.285 --> 16:47.000
But I have so many detailed memories.

16:47.300 --> 16:49.300
I remember the little things, you know?

16:49.500 --> 16:53.300
Like the, uh, G.I. joes I hid in a Thom Mcan box

16:53.335 --> 16:55.667
Behind a loose baseboard in my bedroom.

16:55.702 --> 16:58.000
Did I make that up?
I don't know. Did you?

16:59.000 --> 17:01.700
Ohh. how much did I drink last night?

17:01.735 --> 17:04.365
That was pure bliss you were on. huh.

17:04.400 --> 17:08.700
The Maharishi special. I told you he was righteous.

17:20.500 --> 17:21.300
Good morning.

17:22.099 --> 17:24.400
Morning. thought you might want to know the lieutenant

17:24.435 --> 17:26.400
Was banging around the precinct looking for you.

17:26.435 --> 17:27.665
If we don't get this case solved soon,

17:27.700 --> 17:31.300
I think he's gonna burst into flames. 
- Hold on two seconds.

17:31.500 --> 17:33.265
Oh, but what I really wanted to tell you--

17:33.300 --> 17:35.900
I went to the impound, searched Robert Reeves' car.

17:37.900 --> 17:40.200
Didn't find much.
- I'll be right back.

17:43.600 --> 17:44.250
Who's that?

17:44.285 --> 17:44.900
A girl...

17:45.000 --> 17:47.700
I work with, Annie.
Annie? that's a nice name.

17:47.735 --> 17:49.900
And how come Annie isn't allowed in?

17:49.935 --> 17:50.900
Annie is allowed in.

17:51.200 --> 17:53.100
It's just... she, uh...

17:55.100 --> 17:56.000
I'll talk to you later.

17:56.400 --> 17:59.100
Have a good day, 2-B. 
Tell Annie I said hi.

18:03.800 --> 18:06.100
Okay, so what have we got?

18:06.300 --> 18:07.500
Rough night last night?

18:07.600 --> 18:10.100
Not really, no. A little insomnia maybe.

18:10.900 --> 18:13.000
Um, well, here you go. this...

18:13.035 --> 18:14.800
What? oh.

18:17.900 --> 18:20.000
You're kidding me. 
This is all we've got?

18:23.900 --> 18:25.500
The business card of an accountant?

18:25.700 --> 18:28.065
I'm sorry. i--
I'm not blaming you.

18:28.100 --> 18:30.700
It's just Hunt is gonna have someone's ass.

18:31.700 --> 18:34.900
All right, let's go check out Lawrence R. Jones.

18:35.500 --> 18:37.600
So where did you meet Robert Reeves?

18:37.900 --> 18:40.500
Uh, at a bar, through another client of mine

18:40.535 --> 18:42.100
Who sends a lot of new business my way.

18:42.300 --> 18:44.800
He had questions about,
Uh, tax liability.

18:46.000 --> 18:47.700
Taxes? in May?

18:48.300 --> 18:50.300
Uh, s-something about an inheritance.

18:53.500 --> 18:54.165
Who died?

18:54.200 --> 18:55.200
Oh, he didn't say.

18:56.900 --> 18:58.900
What was the name of the bar where you met Reeves?

18:58.935 --> 19:00.700
Oh, ooh, I don't remember.

19:00.900 --> 19:03.500
Oh, the carlyle hotel, in the bar.

19:04.400 --> 19:05.800
You ever hear Bobby short?

19:06.500 --> 19:08.300
Oh, sensational.

19:09.600 --> 19:12.200
"sensational." I always loved that word.

19:13.300 --> 19:15.500
The wife didn't mention anything about an inheritance,

19:15.800 --> 19:17.500
And it's not exactly tax season.

19:17.700 --> 19:20.300
You know, if I didn't know better, I'd say Jones was...

19:21.300 --> 19:21.800
What?

19:22.400 --> 19:23.100
You know.

19:24.500 --> 19:26.300
Fishy? 
- No.

19:26.700 --> 19:28.200
Dodgy?
No.

19:29.600 --> 19:31.700
Annie, I don't know what you mean by...

19:33.500 --> 19:34.600
Homosexual.

19:40.700 --> 19:41.465
What makes you say that?

19:41.500 --> 19:44.250
Well, I know psychologists think that homosexuality

19:44.285 --> 19:48.900
is caused by a conflict between the ID and the ego
or some dominating mother.

19:49.200 --> 19:50.565
I think that's all a bunch of crap.

19:50.600 --> 19:53.365
Just something in his body language, you know?

19:53.400 --> 19:56.600
The way he sat, the way he fussed with his clothes,

19:56.635 --> 19:58.065
How he used the word "sensational"

19:58.100 --> 20:02.900
Like it was made out of milk chocolate. 
Women have such great gaydar.

20:03.400 --> 20:04.800
"Gaydar"?
mm.

20:06.900 --> 20:08.700
Gaydar.
Gaydar.

20:08.800 --> 20:10.100
Did you come up with that yourself?

20:10.135 --> 20:11.700
No, no. I heard it somewhere.

20:14.600 --> 20:15.200
Chris.

20:16.200 --> 20:17.400
Sam, Annie.

20:22.100 --> 20:23.100
What do we got?

20:23.300 --> 20:25.765
Well, Annie here brought in a tax accountant,

20:25.800 --> 20:29.700
Which I think's a great lead If it was, uh, April 15th.

20:29.735 --> 20:32.600
Actually, Annie has an interesting theory

20:32.635 --> 20:33.700
About Robert Reeves.

20:34.300 --> 20:35.600
Well, let's hear it, Norris.

20:37.000 --> 20:39.100
Well, the accountant was obviously...

20:43.900 --> 20:47.265
Um, I think maybe, uh,

20:47.300 --> 20:51.200
Robert Reeves is a, uh, was a homosexual.

20:56.500 --> 20:58.000
What are you talkin' about?

20:58.600 --> 21:00.800
They met at a bar, and...

21:01.700 --> 21:02.500
And?

21:04.300 --> 21:06.800
And if the accountant was gay,
and they were meeting

21:06.835 --> 21:07.965
After working hours--

21:08.000 --> 21:10.300
Robert Reeves was a war hero

21:11.900 --> 21:13.600
and a family man.

21:14.600 --> 21:16.900
Is this the way you want his son to remember him?

21:17.000 --> 21:20.800
Just hear her out. 
Hear what? that because he had a drink with his accountant,

21:21.000 --> 21:22.200
That makes him a queer?

21:22.600 --> 21:24.500
I once shared an ice cream cone with a midget.

21:24.535 --> 21:26.400
Does that make me 4 foot tall?

21:28.200 --> 21:29.065
Better question--

21:29.100 --> 21:31.600
Does any of this have anything to do with my investigation?

21:33.000 --> 21:36.100
Find me the tough guy responsible for this!

21:51.700 --> 21:53.400
Hey, Robbie.
- Hey.

21:53.700 --> 21:54.565
Is your mom around?

21:54.600 --> 21:56.465
Nah, she's at the butcher's.

21:56.500 --> 22:00.100
She said she'd be gone for a while, 
though. how about those knicks, huh?

22:00.400 --> 22:03.100
Did you see game three?
Pretty amazing.

22:05.100 --> 22:07.100
I know it wasn't the same without your dad.

22:07.400 --> 22:08.700
Did you find who killed him yet?

22:09.500 --> 22:11.200
Not yet, but we will.

22:13.600 --> 22:14.700
I promised you I would.

22:22.300 --> 22:25.300
My dad had this way about him, you know?

22:25.600 --> 22:29.200
He was the man. It was the way
he dressed, the way he laughed.

22:29.400 --> 22:30.465
And whenever he was near,

22:30.500 --> 22:35.400
I felt like nothing could ever go wrong. 
- I don't care about your dad.

22:35.435 --> 22:37.400
Your dad left. My dad died.

22:41.600 --> 22:42.500
That's true,

22:42.900 --> 22:44.600
But your dad didn't give up on you.

22:45.800 --> 22:47.100
Your dad didn't have a choice.

22:49.800 --> 22:51.565
My dad made two promises to me.

22:51.600 --> 22:54.300
the first--if the knicks made it to a play-off,

22:54.335 --> 22:55.365
He'd take me to a game.

22:55.400 --> 22:58.100
And when they did, he honored that promise.

22:59.000 --> 23:01.800
We took the subway. It was my first time taking it.

23:02.300 --> 23:03.600
He held my hand.

23:04.000 --> 23:05.800
God, I remember it like it was yesterday.

23:06.100 --> 23:09.500
I remember he had a tattoo on
the hand that always held mine.

23:09.535 --> 23:11.700
It was, uh, a cobra,

23:12.500 --> 23:13.700
'cause that had been his nickname

23:13.735 --> 23:15.700
when he was a kid--"cobra."

23:18.900 --> 23:21.300
So what was the second promise?

23:21.700 --> 23:23.000
It was my 4th birthday party.

23:24.000 --> 23:25.900
He went for a walk in the woods,
said he'd be right back.

23:27.400 --> 23:30.900
That was the last time I ever saw him. 
Now hand 'em over.

23:31.100 --> 23:32.265
Hand what over?

23:32.300 --> 23:34.100
The cigarettes. Give 'em to me.

23:37.700 --> 23:38.500
How did you know?

23:38.800 --> 23:41.800
I'm a detective, Robbie. I detect things.

23:43.700 --> 23:44.900
Where did you get these?

23:45.200 --> 23:48.300
They were my dad's. 
There are a lot of ways you can deal with

23:48.335 --> 23:49.700
what's happening to you right now.

23:50.000 --> 23:52.400
This is not the way.

23:52.900 --> 23:53.500
Okay?

24:01.900 --> 24:04.700
Catch. I'll talk to you later, Robbie. 
Sam?

24:59.200 --> 24:59.900
sam?

25:00.300 --> 25:01.600
What are you doing in here?

25:03.800 --> 25:05.300
I saw the diamonds.

25:06.200 --> 25:07.100
I came in...

25:08.100 --> 25:09.400
The loose baseboard...

25:11.300 --> 25:12.500
I found this picture.

25:17.300 --> 25:17.965
Who is she?

25:18.000 --> 25:22.200
I don't know. 
this looks just like a place I remember living.

25:22.400 --> 25:24.800
I even found this box right where I thought it would be.

25:24.835 --> 25:26.500
Look-- no G.I.Joes.

25:28.200 --> 25:28.900
Wait.

25:29.400 --> 25:32.900
Don't you see? this case brought me to this block

25:32.935 --> 25:34.400
so I could see this apartment building.

25:34.700 --> 25:36.200
I think this is where I lived.

25:36.235 --> 25:39.800
I think this was my bedroom. 
- Maybe.

25:41.200 --> 25:44.200
And maybe it's just a coincidence.

25:44.400 --> 25:45.800
I don't believe in coincidences.

25:46.800 --> 25:52.500
I believe in the curlicued whimsy of fate. 
- Sam, you've suffered a head injury.

25:52.700 --> 25:55.300
This can happen, hiccups in your mind.

25:56.000 --> 25:57.400
Everything is connected.

26:13.700 --> 26:16.100
This proves I'd go anywhere for a drink.

26:18.000 --> 26:19.600
Reeves used to frequent this place.

26:21.900 --> 26:22.600
So?

26:23.600 --> 26:24.900
The kid had this matchbook.

26:25.600 --> 26:28.200
It's from here. Said it belonged to his dad.

26:31.400 --> 26:33.500
You know, a lot of people are gay, and you can't tell.

26:33.700 --> 26:35.700
Oh, yeah. Like who?

26:36.300 --> 26:39.000
I don't know.
Uh, Rock Hudson.

26:41.800 --> 26:44.100
Tyler, you sicken me.
What?

26:44.135 --> 26:45.465
The Rock?
Yeah.

26:45.500 --> 26:48.500
Who's doing things to Doris Day you could only dream of?

26:49.400 --> 26:54.500
What's the matter with you? um, excuse me. 
We're detectives from the 1-2-5.

26:54.535 --> 26:57.565
Ever seen this guy before?
Why should I tell you?

26:57.600 --> 27:01.200
'Cause someone beat him to death. 
So they finally killed of us.

27:01.235 --> 27:02.900
And now you fellas care.

27:03.100 --> 27:04.965
Who's the dead guy, a congressman?

27:05.000 --> 27:08.400
Just answer the question, Lulu. 
His name is Bobby.

27:08.500 --> 27:11.450
Married I think, very sweet.
He's one of those guys

27:11.485 --> 27:14.365
Who just figured out
Who he really was,

27:14.400 --> 27:17.900
If you know what I mean. 
You know if he was, um, seeing an accountant

27:17.935 --> 27:21.967
By the name of Jones? 
Larry Jones? whoo, not a chance.

27:22.002 --> 27:26.000
Larry's so deep in the closet he passes out business cards

27:26.035 --> 27:28.265
Hoping to get rich, not lucky.

27:28.300 --> 27:30.500
What can you tell us about violence in this area?

27:30.535 --> 27:32.965
Hooligans from the bar across the park.

27:33.000 --> 27:35.900
They like to get boomered on Fridays and Saturday nights

27:35.935 --> 27:37.200
and beat up the queers.

27:37.400 --> 27:39.900
It's been really bad since the play-offs started.

27:40.000 --> 27:45.000
Just ask Gary over there.
You see?

27:45.500 --> 27:47.900
Reeves' murder is looking more and more like a hate crime.

27:49.900 --> 27:53.200
What?
As opposed to an "i really, really like you" crime?

27:57.200 --> 27:59.550
Okay, and I got mug shots, sketches, rap sheets.

27:59.585 --> 28:01.900
there have been numerous incidents at this precinct,

28:01.935 --> 28:03.900
All athe same park with the exact same M.O.

28:04.800 --> 28:06.665
Looks like you got some gay bashers around here.

28:06.700 --> 28:09.500
"Gay bashing"? what's that, throwing a party for a queer?

28:12.000 --> 28:14.100
I don't know. 
I'm thinking of taking the old lady

28:14.135 --> 28:16.017
to see "Soylent green." 
What do you think?

28:16.052 --> 28:17.900
It's supposed to be good.
We're not...

28:19.600 --> 28:22.000
We're not what? 
We're not gonna put this case on the back burner

28:22.035 --> 28:23.800
because reeves turned out to be homosexual.

28:26.900 --> 28:28.900
I don't know what you're talkin' about.

28:32.400 --> 28:33.500
Unbelievable.

28:38.300 --> 28:41.800
You know, this kind of rampant prejudice

28:42.000 --> 28:44.900
and hatred is gonna someday, quite literally,

28:45.100 --> 28:49.100
change this city--the physical landscape of this city--

28:49.135 --> 28:51.900
In ways you can't even imagine

28:52.700 --> 28:56.300
and get us into other wars for even flimsier reasons
than the one that just ended.

28:58.600 --> 28:59.600
Have fun, kids.

29:00.300 --> 29:01.900
The crackers are made out of people!

29:03.000 --> 29:03.700
Yeah.

29:07.600 --> 29:08.200
What?

29:08.500 --> 29:13.200
Least i can do is spoil the ending of the movie for that guy.
Okay, forget him.

29:13.500 --> 29:15.265
I guess that just leaves us.
Sam--

29:15.300 --> 29:17.300
Based on these reports, these same guys are out there

29:17.335 --> 29:19.467
Every weekend bashing heads in the park.

29:19.502 --> 29:21.600
So we're gonna lay some bait with a wire on

29:22.000 --> 29:25.300
Until we catch them.
Bait? who's the bait?

29:31.400 --> 29:31.900
What?

29:34.000 --> 29:34.800
Who, me?

29:35.800 --> 29:37.700
No. no. I...

29:38.600 --> 29:40.700
No, I don't look like a, uh...

29:40.735 --> 29:41.600
One of those.

29:43.700 --> 29:45.500
Hey, Chris.
You see anything out there yet?

29:45.800 --> 29:46.900
He can't hear you.

29:50.500 --> 29:52.465
Won't it be great when they invent 2-way technology

29:52.500 --> 29:55.900
For this kind of thing? 
Yeah, right, after they invent a world without paper.

29:56.900 --> 30:06.000
Just thought you guys should know
that this is making me really, really uncomfortable.

30:21.600 --> 30:24.500
Holy cow. That guy looked just like my uncle Harold.

30:24.800 --> 30:27.100
But my uncle Harold-- he wasn't a-a...

30:27.500 --> 30:30.300
No, no, no, he took me to my first broadway musical.

30:33.400 --> 30:35.900
Wow. Uncle harold?

30:44.500 --> 30:45.400
Hey, boss.

30:46.800 --> 30:49.150
I'm leavin' in a minute.
i'm taking Denise to the movies.

30:49.185 --> 30:51.500
A little Eddie g. Robinson,
A little Charlton Heston,

30:51.535 --> 30:53.617
Nobody gets hurt. 
Where are the others?

30:53.652 --> 30:55.665
Well, Tyler got a lead on the dead fairy.

30:55.700 --> 30:57.965
They went to chase it.
- Why aren't you with them?

30:58.000 --> 31:02.000
Ah, you know. 
What's one less rocket lover in the world,

31:02.035 --> 31:02.600
Right?

31:03.700 --> 31:04.400
Get up.

31:06.400 --> 31:07.400
What?

31:07.435 --> 31:08.400
Get up.

31:12.800 --> 31:13.600
So?

31:13.700 --> 31:16.800
He's a fruit fly. 
Know whos worse than a fruit fly, Ray?

31:16.835 --> 31:21.000
A murderer. there's nothing lower than a murderer.

31:21.100 --> 31:23.350
So what's the difference who the victim was?

31:23.385 --> 31:25.600
No man has the right to take another man's life,

31:25.635 --> 31:27.100
No matter what you and I think.

31:27.600 --> 31:31.900
There's a killer on the loose, and it's our job
to pursue him to the very gates of hell.

31:33.900 --> 31:36.000
Do you understand this?
Boss, I-I'm--

31:36.035 --> 31:36.600
Tell me!

31:37.800 --> 31:38.800
You understand this?

31:41.300 --> 31:41.900
Yeah.

31:42.700 --> 31:43.700
I understand.

31:44.500 --> 31:45.100
Good

31:53.500 --> 31:54.600
Nothing is happening.

31:57.100 --> 31:58.300
Yeah, I think so.

32:04.400 --> 32:05.400
Queer!

32:08.900 --> 32:10.100
Get out of our park!

32:21.800 --> 32:22.900
Game over, pal.

32:30.100 --> 32:32.000
Get to your knees!
hands behind your head!

32:32.400 --> 32:33.000
Do it!

32:34.600 --> 32:35.500
You okay, Chris?

32:35.700 --> 32:36.600
I think so.

32:37.000 --> 32:39.300
Annie?
Yeah. yeah.

32:41.900 --> 32:42.600
Well done.

32:56.500 --> 32:57.500
Look at my guy.

32:58.000 --> 32:59.700
Look what you did to his face.

33:00.400 --> 33:03.800
He's a beautiful boy. 
Look at him now.

33:07.600 --> 33:12.600
Also let me remind you that the murder victim
is a decorated vietnam vet.

33:15.600 --> 33:16.800
He'd want you to have that.

33:19.200 --> 33:21.265
He was a perv and a queer.

33:21.300 --> 33:27.465
Which in your mind means he didn't have the right to a long, happy life?
And his son didn't have...

33:27.500 --> 33:31.000
the right to have his daddy. 
Look, we like to mess those guys up.

33:31.035 --> 33:33.800
They're disgusting, okay?
But we didn't kill anybody.

33:34.000 --> 33:36.500
We're just havin' fun, all right? 
So am I.

33:43.300 --> 33:44.000
Hey.

33:46.300 --> 33:48.000
So the thing to remember about prison,

33:48.500 --> 33:50.900
Which is where you're gonna go if you don't cooperate,

33:51.600 --> 33:56.200
Is this--in prison, these things you find so offensive,

33:56.300 --> 33:58.265
Well, they're an everyday occurrence

33:58.300 --> 34:02.000
perpetrated by big, strong men on little, skinny men

34:02.035 --> 34:03.900
as regular as breakfast.

34:05.000 --> 34:08.100
In fact, a typical day in prison
goes something like this--

34:08.135 --> 34:10.167
breakfast, sodomy,

34:10.202 --> 34:12.199
exercise yard, sodomy,

34:12.400 --> 34:15.800
lunch, sodomy, arts and crafts, sodomy,

34:16.100 --> 34:18.900
dinner, major sodomy--
Detective Tyler,

34:19.000 --> 34:23.000
What's the difference between sodomy and major sodomy?

34:24.300 --> 34:26.900
Well, major sodomy has a big kissing component.

34:26.935 --> 34:29.000
I saw it. 
- Saw what?

34:29.199 --> 34:31.400
Jimmy, you don't gotta tell these guys nothin'!

34:32.000 --> 34:33.100
Neither do you!
Ohh!

34:35.300 --> 34:37.400
I-I-I saw two guys in the park.

34:37.699 --> 34:39.699
Go on.
Okay, one of 'em was him.

34:40.699 --> 34:43.500
They--they--they were, uh,
They were kissing at first.

34:43.534 --> 34:46.100
He said somethin' I-I couldn't hear.

34:47.100 --> 34:49.400
And--and the other guy yanked his arm away,

34:50.000 --> 34:51.699
And--and he-- And he tried to get away,

34:51.735 --> 34:53.100
But he couldn't.

34:53.800 --> 34:56.699
Then he just threw that guy down to the ground.

34:56.800 --> 34:59.400
And he just leaned over and started punching him,

34:59.435 --> 35:01.600
Just punch after punch after punch.

35:03.000 --> 35:05.900
And now you're telling me he's dead?

35:07.000 --> 35:10.100
You said he leaned over to punch him?

35:11.100 --> 35:12.565
Did he ever kick him?
No, no.

35:12.600 --> 35:13.965
Wven when he was down on the ground,

35:14.000 --> 35:16.200
You're sure he bent over to keep punching the guy--

35:16.400 --> 35:18.165
Never kicked him, not even once? 
Nope.

35:18.200 --> 35:22.800
and when the killer ran away, 
Was there anything funny about the way he ran off?

35:23.300 --> 35:27.200
Yeah. How'd you know?
Yeah, there was.

35:27.800 --> 35:29.600
Yeah, he-- he was runnin' real fast

35:29.800 --> 35:31.600
f-for a guy with a limp.

35:35.700 --> 35:39.200
So you were a captain, a leader of men.

35:39.500 --> 35:40.300
That's right.

35:42.800 --> 35:45.200
Look, I see you got a lot to lose here--

35:45.500 --> 35:47.865
Your honor, your family's respect.

35:47.900 --> 35:50.100
but Robert Reeves, by all accounts a good man

35:50.135 --> 35:52.500
And a fine officer, is dead.

35:53.800 --> 35:56.600
Now this isn't how we do things in the squad where I come from,

35:57.600 --> 35:59.300
But if you just tell us what happened,

35:59.800 --> 36:01.700
Nobody has to know why you did it.

36:11.800 --> 36:13.950
I'm not gonna say exactly what happened over there.

36:13.985 --> 36:16.065
It's nobody's business. but Bob wanted to bring it

36:16.100 --> 36:21.600
back here, into the world, where everything's different. 
Where everything's different?

36:21.635 --> 36:24.665
Where you don't get to decide who lives or who dies, captain?

36:24.700 --> 36:28.200
It wasn't like that. 
You'd think you couldn't live with homosexuality,

36:28.235 --> 36:30.000
but you could live with being a murderer.

36:30.200 --> 36:31.665
Other there you might've killed to survive.

36:31.700 --> 36:35.000
But you killed here because you didn't like a guy is queer.

36:35.035 --> 36:38.300
Look, Bob thought he was living a lie when he got back.

36:40.000 --> 36:43.900
He thought that a man of integrity wouldn't fear

36:44.600 --> 36:46.050
what other people thought of him.

36:46.085 --> 36:47.500
You fear what people think of you.

36:50.400 --> 36:52.600
I have to say, Bob had courage.

36:54.800 --> 36:56.600
I didn't mean to kill him.
I didn't.

36:57.700 --> 36:58.500
I just...

37:00.400 --> 37:03.200
wanted to get away from him, but he wouldn't let me go,

37:03.235 --> 37:04.900
And when he went too far,
I just...

37:07.400 --> 37:08.800
It all came apart.

37:09.600 --> 37:11.100
Yes, it did. 
It did.

37:12.100 --> 37:13.100
It will do that.

37:14.000 --> 37:18.500
It will all come apart in war and in peace.

37:25.200 --> 37:26.100
Cuff him.

37:28.800 --> 37:30.900
Gays in the military. Unbelievable.

37:32.300 --> 37:35.100
What next? they're gonna want to get married?

37:36.100 --> 37:37.865
Lucky coincidence,
Huh, Tyler?

37:37.900 --> 37:39.565
You just happen to collar the very guys

37:39.600 --> 37:44.100
who see him killing Reeves.
I don't believe in coincidences, Ray.

37:44.300 --> 37:46.100
I believe in the curlicued whimsy of fate.

37:46.300 --> 37:48.400
After all, everything's connected.

37:50.100 --> 37:52.500
I still don't understand why you need to do this--

37:53.300 --> 37:55.100
to ruin the memories of her husband?

37:55.700 --> 37:57.300
The only question Carrie Ann Reeves

37:57.335 --> 37:58.500
wanted answered was "why?"

37:59.600 --> 38:00.500
Now we know why.

38:01.700 --> 38:05.300
Can I get you something to drink or-- 
- No. thank you.

38:05.900 --> 38:09.600
Um, there's something I wanted to say about your husband,

38:09.800 --> 38:12.400
Mrs. Reeves, 
Something maybe you didn't know,

38:12.435 --> 38:15.000
Something... Something you need to know.

38:19.600 --> 38:20.200
Okay.

38:23.700 --> 38:24.465
What is it?

38:24.500 --> 38:27.100
Well, your husband was a very brave man,

38:27.200 --> 38:29.500
More courageous than most-- much more.

38:30.500 --> 38:32.700
And he died for what he believed in, mrs. Reeves.

38:33.900 --> 38:35.365
and I wanted you to know that--

38:35.400 --> 38:40.100
Are you saying that someone killed him because of the war, detective?

38:41.300 --> 38:44.200
No. That's not what i'm saying at all.

38:44.900 --> 38:45.800
Well, then what?

38:54.300 --> 38:56.200
It was John Fisher, his squad leader.

38:56.900 --> 38:57.900
John Fisher?

38:58.700 --> 38:59.600
Why?

39:07.600 --> 39:09.900
Because he resented your husband's bravery.

39:10.700 --> 39:12.000
He resented his honor,

39:12.500 --> 39:18.200
Because John Fisher realized that he could never be
the man your husband was.

39:23.600 --> 39:25.600
And sometimes the most intolerant men

39:26.500 --> 39:27.800
are also the most afraid.

39:32.300 --> 39:33.200
You gonna be okay?

39:35.300 --> 39:36.100
I guess.

39:36.800 --> 39:38.900
you have to be... for your mom.

39:39.700 --> 39:40.600
And you know what?

39:41.800 --> 39:43.500
You may not be able to see your dad,

39:44.500 --> 39:46.200
but if you try, you can still feel him.

39:50.800 --> 39:51.600
Come here.

39:54.000 --> 39:54.900
Close your eyes.

39:55.700 --> 39:56.400
Close 'em.

39:58.700 --> 39:59.600
Picture your dad.

40:01.000 --> 40:01.700
Can you feel him?

40:03.900 --> 40:06.100
'Cause if you can feel him, then he's not really gone.

40:07.300 --> 40:09.600
He's here... now.

40:11.100 --> 40:12.800
Now is all there really is.

40:15.300 --> 40:17.000
So anytime you need your dad,

40:18.400 --> 40:19.500
Close your eyes.

40:21.400 --> 40:22.300
He'll be right there.

40:28.235 --> 40:29.500
Whoo! 2-B!

40:29.800 --> 40:33.000
Third time's a charm.
You find yourself yet?

40:33.200 --> 40:35.400
No. Came close a couple times.

40:35.900 --> 40:36.900
I'm starting to think you're right--

40:37.700 --> 40:39.065
that 2008 is the illusion,

40:39.100 --> 40:41.800
and 1973 is definitely a reality,

40:42.300 --> 40:44.700
And the only thing that exists is right now.

40:44.735 --> 40:46.900
Whoa, 2-B!

40:47.400 --> 40:50.000
I think you're finally gettin' the hang of this.

42:06.000 --> 42:16.000
<i>[Isocrate]</i> Took 3 hours to fix this sub , hope you've enjoyed the episode ^_^ .
