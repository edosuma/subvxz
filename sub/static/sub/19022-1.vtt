00:01.827 --> 00:04.735
Keep your heads down! We
got a man down! Man down!

00:04.737 --> 00:06.356
Pull him back! Pull him back!

00:06.357 --> 00:08.614
Bravo-Zero-One, this is K-Bar.

00:08.616 --> 00:10.908
We have multiple IEDs in contact.

00:10.922 --> 00:12.129
We're pinned down!

00:12.142 --> 00:14.054
Where's the support?! We need help!

00:14.056 --> 00:16.245
Roger, K-Bar. Stand by.

00:16.247 --> 00:18.771
Shadow-One-One, Bravo-Zero-One.

00:18.773 --> 00:21.230
Go for Shadow-One-One.

00:21.232 --> 00:24.357
Roger. U.S. Afghan troops in contact.

00:24.359 --> 00:25.947
Please defer to the following grid.

00:30.333 --> 00:32.322
He's bleeding out! Tie it off!

00:38.076 --> 00:40.684
Stay with me! Look at me! Stay with me!

00:40.686 --> 00:43.059
Truck incoming!

00:43.061 --> 00:44.903
Take him out! Take him out!

00:48.524 --> 00:50.707
Aah! I'm bleeding out!

00:52.712 --> 00:54.811
Aah!

00:54.813 --> 00:57.116
Pull him back!

01:02.203 --> 01:04.406
K-Bar, this is Delta-One coming to you.

01:06.775 --> 01:09.727

- Do it!

01:24.983 --> 01:27.207
We'll get you out of here in a second.

01:27.209 --> 01:28.250
- Take cover!
- Move!

01:28.252 --> 01:29.824
Look! The guys on the hill!

01:29.826 --> 01:30.979
Get their ass down!

01:44.163 --> 01:45.528
They're headed for lower ground!

01:45.530 --> 01:46.929
- RPG!
- Look right! Look right!

01:46.931 --> 01:49.165
- Go!
- I got you, I got you!

01:49.167 --> 01:50.667
Go! Go! Go! Go!

02:00.410 --> 02:02.710
- Bear!
- Cover!

02:05.516 --> 02:07.169
Rocket out!

02:13.406 --> 02:14.621
Go.

02:17.960 --> 02:19.445
Aah!

02:23.796 --> 02:26.431
Banshee Two-Two, this is Delta-One.

02:26.433 --> 02:28.633
Request fire mission.

02:28.635 --> 02:31.469
Two buildings 200 meters
north of our position.

02:31.471 --> 02:33.572
Our position marked by orange panel.

02:33.574 --> 02:34.906
Get the panel out!

02:34.908 --> 02:36.841
Delta-One, this is Banshee Two-Two.

02:36.843 --> 02:38.097
Tally your mark.

02:38.099 --> 02:40.347
Rolling in from the
north. 20 seconds out.

02:40.348 --> 02:42.314
Banshee Two-Two, roger.

02:49.269 --> 02:51.302
K-Bar, be ready to move.

02:51.304 --> 02:54.005
Delta-One, this is Banshee
Two-Two. Shots away.

03:05.019 --> 03:07.052
Come on!

03:07.054 --> 03:09.124
- Let's go right now! Come on!
- Go, go, get up, go, go.

03:09.126 --> 03:11.089
Keep moving! We got you covered!

03:11.091 --> 03:12.490
Come on! Keep moving!

03:21.184 --> 03:23.069
She's saying she got
shot. She needs help.

03:23.094 --> 03:25.110
"Help me. Help me."

03:27.357 --> 03:29.041
Hey, what are those guys doing? Hey!

03:29.043 --> 03:30.486
_

03:32.186 --> 03:33.617
_

03:34.464 --> 03:37.249
Get your guys back! It's a trap!

03:37.251 --> 03:38.724
Get those guys... God damn it!

03:51.547 --> 03:52.682
He did this.

03:54.650 --> 03:57.635
Come on, Rip. We can't know that.

03:57.637 --> 03:59.595
Muttaqi did this.

04:01.791 --> 04:04.242
He can't be everywhere.

04:04.244 --> 04:06.477
They said the same thing
about Bin Laden, Amigo.

04:06.479 --> 04:08.732
We'll find him, and we'll put him down.

04:11.368 --> 04:14.601
Hey, whack-a-mole, right? Let's roll.

04:16.672 --> 04:19.041
You good?

04:21.110 --> 04:22.760
Rip.

05:13.157 --> 05:15.384
I told Bob... you know,
the youth minister...

05:15.386 --> 05:17.216
I told him to have the kids choir

05:17.218 --> 05:18.649
sing in the fellowship hall.

05:18.651 --> 05:21.498
We sold 150 cupcakes in an hour.

05:21.523 --> 05:22.805
What was the sermon about?

05:22.830 --> 05:24.724
"Greater love hath no man than this,

05:24.749 --> 05:26.757
that he lay down his
life for his friends."

05:26.759 --> 05:30.312
John 15:13.

05:30.337 --> 05:33.562
Right. Those names
we were talking about?

05:33.587 --> 05:34.366
Yeah?

05:34.368 --> 05:37.635
Well, meet Sarah.

05:39.239 --> 05:40.853
Hey.

05:40.878 --> 05:41.978
Good job, Bear.

05:42.003 --> 05:43.778
Really happy for you, Bear.
I'd give mine back if I could.

05:43.780 --> 05:45.003
You don't mean that.

05:45.028 --> 05:46.780
Children... It's what it's all about.

05:46.782 --> 05:48.346
No, I mean it.

05:48.348 --> 05:49.886
Wait, how long have you been over here?

05:49.888 --> 05:52.216
- You sure she's yours?
- Very funny, Caulder.

05:52.218 --> 05:54.620
I-I-I got to go.

05:54.622 --> 05:56.969
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

05:59.906 --> 06:02.226
We're naming her Sarah.

06:02.228 --> 06:03.762
Wait, from the Bible? Abraham's wife?

06:03.764 --> 06:06.564
- Here it comes.
- Abraham was a player, dude.

06:06.566 --> 06:07.865
Dude had like five wives.

06:07.867 --> 06:09.500
My man Abe was all about hitting it.

06:09.502 --> 06:11.971
You're going to Hell.
You know that, right?

06:11.996 --> 06:14.238
Yeah, I did know a
Sarah from Coronado once.

06:14.240 --> 06:15.606
Best pole dancer I ever saw.

06:15.608 --> 06:18.576
Sarah's a fine name. Sarita.

06:18.578 --> 06:20.611
- Sounds good in Spanish, too.
- Yes, man.

06:20.613 --> 06:22.281
You'll like being a father, Bear.

06:22.283 --> 06:23.702
Gives you ballast.

06:23.727 --> 06:26.039
- Keeps you upright through the storm.
- Thank you, Buddha.

06:26.063 --> 06:29.059
Coming from the guy who takes two
days to make tea out of dried grass.

06:29.084 --> 06:31.423
It's not tea, pendejo. It's mate.

06:31.425 --> 06:33.758
It's got 24 vitamins and
minerals, 15 amino acids,

06:33.760 --> 06:35.493
and a shitload of antioxidants.

06:35.495 --> 06:37.461
It's Red Bull for taco heads.

06:37.463 --> 06:41.222
South American, Caulder.
You don't know shit.

06:41.247 --> 06:43.848
Hey. Rip wants to see us in the TOC.

06:43.873 --> 06:45.269
Now.

06:45.271 --> 06:47.913
Let's go.

07:00.442 --> 07:02.292
Look at this.

07:02.294 --> 07:05.061
Looks like Muttaqi struck again.

07:05.063 --> 07:08.299
43 casualties.

07:08.301 --> 07:11.901
We picked up SIGINT at
a village up in Kunar.

07:11.903 --> 07:13.147
Full Taliban.

07:13.172 --> 07:15.139
He's surrounded by civilians,

07:15.164 --> 07:17.775
so drones and air strikes are out.

07:17.777 --> 07:20.276
We're working up a CONOPS.

07:20.278 --> 07:22.979
Command wants us to take a shot tonight.

07:22.981 --> 07:25.806
You know how many times we've
rolled snake eyes with this guy?

07:26.464 --> 07:27.814
So, what do you think?

07:29.905 --> 07:31.506
You know what I think.

07:33.025 --> 07:34.640
All right, let's do this.

07:35.150 --> 07:38.061
Right, Amigo?

07:38.063 --> 07:41.331
Yeah. Why not? It's a
nice night for a walk.

07:41.333 --> 07:44.019
Caulder?

07:47.555 --> 07:49.306
Yeah, sure.

07:49.308 --> 07:50.540
Okay.

07:50.542 --> 07:54.229
Hey, Rip. Bear's got news.

07:57.538 --> 07:58.673
It's a girl.

08:00.368 --> 08:01.852
Wow.

08:01.877 --> 08:04.344
We're having a little girl.

08:04.369 --> 08:06.103
That's great news. Good for you, Bear.

08:06.128 --> 08:08.324
- Good for you.
- Yeah.

08:08.326 --> 08:10.551
And we want you to be the godfather.

08:10.576 --> 08:14.495
I'm... I'm honored, but you know me.

08:14.520 --> 08:16.958
- How can you say no?
- I don't... I don't... I don't know.

08:16.983 --> 08:18.597
I don't know...

08:19.982 --> 08:22.533
Let me see her one more
time. Okay, yeah. I'm in.

08:23.903 --> 08:25.074
- Congratulations.
- Thanks, brother.

08:28.408 --> 08:30.079
- Let's go get this asshole.
- Let's go to work.

08:30.081 --> 08:31.795
Let's roll.

09:54.477 --> 09:55.926
Delta set.

09:55.928 --> 09:57.963
Two Troop, Fox Two-Two, stand by.

09:57.965 --> 09:59.864
Stand by.

09:59.866 --> 10:03.032
In 3... 2... 1.

10:03.057 --> 10:03.787
Execute.

10:06.189 --> 10:07.991
Open!

10:18.152 --> 10:20.551
Drop it!

10:23.122 --> 10:26.458
Who's got Muttaqi?

10:26.460 --> 10:28.693
- Caulder.
- It's not Muttaqi.

10:28.695 --> 10:30.528
- Amigo?
- This one, either.

10:30.530 --> 10:31.962
God damn.

10:31.964 --> 10:34.833
Building One-One clear.

10:34.835 --> 10:36.720
Check this out.

10:43.060 --> 10:45.097
Goddamn savages.

10:50.732 --> 10:52.450
- Rip.
- Don't do that shit, man.

10:52.452 --> 10:53.884
- Jesus.
- Rip!

11:03.561 --> 11:05.645
Hey, we got a squirter!

11:05.670 --> 11:07.693
That's got to be Muttaqi. Let's go.

11:07.718 --> 11:09.990
Reaper has eyes on.
Squirter moving northwest.

11:10.015 --> 11:11.540
Reaper One-One has sparkle.

11:11.542 --> 11:12.849
Delta coming up.

11:30.446 --> 11:32.042
Aw, hell. Where'd that come from?

11:34.043 --> 11:35.568
Hold your fire, Buck.

11:36.746 --> 11:38.062
On me.

11:44.286 --> 11:47.437
- Really, Caulder?
- Thank me later.

12:02.047 --> 12:03.398
Blow the truck.

12:03.423 --> 12:04.373
Check.

12:07.085 --> 12:09.120
Thermobaric out.

12:17.937 --> 12:20.305
Foxtrot Delta-Two, Reaper One-One,

12:20.307 --> 12:22.641
we have two squirters 150 meters out.

12:22.643 --> 12:24.542
Maneuvering towards northwest gate.

12:24.544 --> 12:27.278
Reaper One-One. Roger that.
Request containment fire.

12:27.280 --> 12:30.281
Shots away.

12:36.590 --> 12:38.641
Squirters are static at this time.

12:51.753 --> 12:52.822
Got them.

13:02.348 --> 13:04.615
Oh, faaa!

13:04.617 --> 13:07.084
Wait! Wait! I'm American!

13:07.086 --> 13:09.054
- Oh, faaa!
- Down!

13:09.056 --> 13:11.309
Wait! I'm American,
man! I'm from Detroit!

13:11.334 --> 13:13.480
- Roll over!
- Aah! Ow! Okay!

13:13.505 --> 13:16.661
No, wait... Ow! Faaa!

13:16.663 --> 13:19.030
Wait, man! I'm from Detroit, okay?

13:19.032 --> 13:20.086
I'm from Detroit, guys. Come on.

13:20.110 --> 13:22.893
Uh, I know I should be a Pistons
fan, but I love the Lakers, man.

13:22.918 --> 13:23.935
I love Kobe Bryant,

13:23.937 --> 13:25.608
and I know a lot of
people don't, but I do.

13:25.610 --> 13:27.671
It's not him. It's not him, either.

13:27.673 --> 13:29.210
- He a Pistons fan?
- No, no, he's just...

13:29.212 --> 13:31.246
He's just a rag-head driver.
He doesn't even speak English.

13:31.248 --> 13:32.356
Where's Muttaqi?

13:32.381 --> 13:33.848
I don't know, man. They
don't tell me anything.

13:33.850 --> 13:35.316
I swear to God. He was
supposed to be here.

13:35.318 --> 13:36.967
Maybe... Maybe he heard you guys coming.

13:36.992 --> 13:39.354
- You the one who killed those kids?
- No! No! It was Abdul!

13:39.356 --> 13:40.756
It was... It was something personal.

13:40.758 --> 13:41.991
You know how these hajis are, man.

13:41.993 --> 13:43.921
Please. My f'ing leg, man.

13:43.923 --> 13:45.752
- Where's your medic?
- Why'd you run, then?

13:45.777 --> 13:48.694
I was scared. Your guys
went all Geronimo in there.

13:48.719 --> 13:49.728
You saw what he did.

13:49.730 --> 13:52.030
Please, I...

13:52.032 --> 13:54.299
I-I want to go home. Please.

13:54.301 --> 13:56.767
No...

13:56.769 --> 13:58.737
What the fuck?

13:58.739 --> 14:00.671
He was a threat.

14:00.673 --> 14:01.809
He surrendered. He was an American.

14:01.811 --> 14:03.174
He's not a goddamn American.

14:03.176 --> 14:04.642
He was working for Muttaqi.

14:04.644 --> 14:06.377
Let's put this one on the bird.

14:06.379 --> 14:08.747
It's not gonna make a difference, Amigo.

14:08.749 --> 14:10.314
He'll be out in two weeks.

14:10.316 --> 14:12.684
Let's put this one on the bird.

14:18.341 --> 14:20.793
This is so... up.

14:27.083 --> 14:28.986
You saw that, Bear.

14:31.319 --> 14:33.304
Rip was right.

14:33.306 --> 14:35.305
He was a threat.

14:35.307 --> 14:38.397
End of story, Caulder. Let's go.

14:55.798 --> 14:59.823
_

15:00.479 --> 15:04.320
_

15:08.254 --> 15:09.938
So, Buddha, this thing for Anabel...

15:09.940 --> 15:11.240
we got to dress up or what?

15:11.242 --> 15:12.640
Just don't wear your Jesus sandals,

15:12.642 --> 15:13.953
if that's what you're asking me.

15:13.978 --> 15:16.178
Hey, they're Birkies.
But, hey, it's your party.

15:16.546 --> 15:18.613
- 15, Buddha.
- Thank you.

15:18.615 --> 15:20.648
You believe Anabel is 15?

15:20.673 --> 15:22.254
- Yeah.
- What are you even doing out here?

15:22.278 --> 15:24.490
You should be selling yerba
mate at a beach somewhere.

15:24.492 --> 15:27.078
Your daughter's 17, in case
you don't remember, bro.

15:27.103 --> 15:28.534
She is?

15:28.559 --> 15:31.726
I had her when I was 12, so
what does that make you... 50?

15:31.728 --> 15:34.193
We're all getting old, amigo.

15:34.218 --> 15:35.529
Ah, not me, man.

15:35.554 --> 15:38.477
I'm-a live hard, die young,
leave a beautiful corpse.

15:38.502 --> 15:40.668
I can see two of three coming true.

15:42.006 --> 15:43.371
Who are you?

15:43.373 --> 15:46.408
That's Chase. Take the empty cage.

15:46.410 --> 15:48.443
- Hey.
- Are you sure about that, Bear?

15:48.445 --> 15:50.212
It didn't end so good for the last guy.

15:50.214 --> 15:51.713
Or the one before.

15:51.715 --> 15:54.116
- Something about a Claymore.
- And a dolphin.

15:54.118 --> 15:56.617
So, this is the new-guy scene
where you give me shit, right?

15:56.619 --> 15:58.721
Hey, Chase, why don't you
go and draw us some beers

15:58.723 --> 16:01.457
from the team room?
Mugs are on the wall.

16:01.459 --> 16:03.524
- Yeah.
- You do know our names, don't you?

16:04.032 --> 16:06.166
Part of the job, kid.

16:06.168 --> 16:08.235
- Hey, new guy.
- Yeah?

16:08.237 --> 16:10.771
Other door.

16:10.773 --> 16:12.973
Oh, that's gonna cost you, bro.

16:30.250 --> 16:31.983
Try again.

16:32.008 --> 16:34.757
Couldn't find Caulder's.

16:34.759 --> 16:37.222
Put it back. No one uses Rip's.

16:40.464 --> 16:41.560
I didn't know.

16:41.562 --> 16:43.795
Well, now you do.

16:50.738 --> 16:52.241
Rip!

16:57.979 --> 17:02.367
Rip! Taggart. Get up.

18:00.426 --> 18:02.941
You look like shit.

18:02.943 --> 18:04.809
How we saving the world today?

18:04.811 --> 18:06.579
P.R. Do-gooder oil company

18:06.581 --> 18:08.514
breaks ground for a new girls' school.

18:08.516 --> 18:10.283
Put these plates in.

18:10.285 --> 18:12.050
I'm good.

18:12.052 --> 18:15.554
You're not a SEAL anymore,
Taggart, so you follow orders.

18:15.556 --> 18:17.390
And orders say we're supposed to look

18:17.392 --> 18:18.723
like we know what we're doing.

18:18.725 --> 18:20.745
Put them in.

18:26.125 --> 18:27.608
What's the comm plan?

18:27.633 --> 18:29.472
The comm plan is, you
charge your cellphone.

18:33.690 --> 18:35.707
Ugh. Lose that.

18:35.709 --> 18:37.575
Jesus. Act professional.

18:37.577 --> 18:39.978
And here... have an Altoid.

18:39.980 --> 18:41.680
Take the whole can.

18:41.682 --> 18:43.048
When I was in the 1st of the 9th,

18:43.050 --> 18:44.883
we never put up with shitbirds like you.

18:44.885 --> 18:47.871
Yeah, I heard you guys
really squared away.

18:57.680 --> 18:59.484
Open the gate!

19:07.343 --> 19:11.537
_

19:11.562 --> 19:14.012
That was beautiful, girls. Thank you.

19:14.014 --> 19:17.917
Thank you, Teacher Na'omi.

19:17.919 --> 19:20.018
Let us begin with our daily reading.

19:20.020 --> 19:22.587
Esther, have you prepared?

19:22.589 --> 19:24.089
Yes, Teacher Na'omi.

19:24.091 --> 19:26.624
Excellent. We can't wait to hear.

19:26.626 --> 19:28.993
Please.

19:28.995 --> 19:31.029
"It was the best of times.

19:31.031 --> 19:32.997
It was the worst of times.

19:32.999 --> 19:34.899
It was the age of wisdom.

19:34.901 --> 19:37.102
It was the age of foolishness.

19:37.104 --> 19:39.504
It was the epoch of belief.

19:39.506 --> 19:41.740
It was the epoch of incredulity.

19:41.742 --> 19:43.942
It was the season of light."

19:43.944 --> 19:46.678
Loving God, we thank you for Anabel,

19:46.680 --> 19:49.114
who today celebrates her 15th birthday.

19:49.116 --> 19:54.486
May she grow in wisdom,
knowledge, and grace.

19:54.488 --> 19:58.556
May she love her family and
be faithful to her friends.

19:58.558 --> 20:03.161
Anabel, you wear these today

20:03.163 --> 20:06.416
to remind us all that
you are a woman now.

20:08.169 --> 20:11.804
But, to me, you are
still my little girl.

20:11.806 --> 20:15.641
You will always be my baby.

20:17.811 --> 20:19.945
Hold it together, Daddy.

20:19.947 --> 20:22.148
You can do it.

20:23.483 --> 20:24.883
Fiesta!

20:34.761 --> 20:36.861
She's so beautiful.

20:36.863 --> 20:39.097
You guys should try again.

20:39.099 --> 20:41.400
I don't think Joe's ready.

20:41.425 --> 20:43.807
They never know what to
do. You have to tell them.

20:43.809 --> 20:45.737
Like Buck would listen.

20:45.739 --> 20:48.072
I've been telling Ricky for
years that he had to get out.

20:48.074 --> 20:49.808
It finally sunk in.

20:49.810 --> 20:51.843
What finally sunk in?

20:51.845 --> 20:53.497
The job at GSS. You know.

20:55.173 --> 20:57.176
The interview's set up?

20:58.534 --> 20:59.918
Ricky didn't tell them?

20:59.920 --> 21:01.624
Joe is gonna take that hard.

21:01.626 --> 21:03.555
Excuse me.

21:25.494 --> 21:28.112
Jack, congratulations. Feel 'em up.

21:28.114 --> 21:30.515
Yeah, Anabel turned out
pretty good considering.

21:30.517 --> 21:33.751
Well, I'm just gonna say this, okay?

21:33.753 --> 21:37.089
- I'm getting out.
- What are you talking about?

21:37.091 --> 21:39.057
Anabel... she got accepted
at that dance school,

21:39.059 --> 21:41.192
and I can't float the
tuition on my E-8 paycheck.

21:41.194 --> 21:44.028
Besides, I'm sick of you guys.

21:44.030 --> 21:47.732
- It's mutual.
- You can't just quit on us.

21:47.734 --> 21:49.567
It's time, Bear.

21:49.569 --> 21:51.870
I'll make sure the new
guy's ready to roll.

21:51.872 --> 21:53.791
But that's it. I'm gone.

21:58.227 --> 22:00.879
So...

22:00.881 --> 22:03.181
Hey, Buckley, let's
get this party started.

22:04.651 --> 22:06.117
What is going on here?

22:06.119 --> 22:08.086
The groundbreaking for your new school.

22:08.088 --> 22:10.154
SymcoPetro wants to give back,

22:10.156 --> 22:12.190
not just with job-creating
economic investments,

22:12.192 --> 22:13.892
but here, with the future.

22:13.917 --> 22:17.562
I was very clear when
I accepted your offer,

22:17.564 --> 22:19.265
and I am grateful. Thank you.

22:19.267 --> 22:21.099
But there was to be no publicity.

22:21.101 --> 22:23.001
It is dangerous for you to be here.

22:23.003 --> 22:24.438
Can't you see the graffiti?

22:24.463 --> 22:27.138
It'll only take a few
minutes. We'll be done.

22:27.140 --> 22:29.307
And one of my colleagues
is here to discuss

22:29.309 --> 22:31.565
some security arrangements
with you so you'll feel safer.

22:33.041 --> 22:34.802
Uh, Miss, if, uh, you
give us a look around,

22:34.827 --> 22:36.323
we can suggest some precautions...

22:36.348 --> 22:38.899
I don't want you mercenaries
anywhere near my students.

22:38.924 --> 22:40.717
Nick, can we get some
more girls in the shot?

22:40.742 --> 22:41.691
Yeah, I'll get them.

22:41.693 --> 22:43.655
No. You all have to leave.

22:43.657 --> 22:45.213
Now.

22:45.238 --> 22:47.230
He's just trying to give
your school some money.

22:47.232 --> 22:48.727
Don't be a problem.

22:48.729 --> 22:50.328
You are the problem here,

22:50.330 --> 22:51.897
not the solution.

22:51.899 --> 22:53.844
You steal our oil and exploit our people

22:53.869 --> 22:55.305
- and tell us it's for our own good.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

22:55.329 --> 22:57.905
Okay, you know what? You're
giving me a goddamn headache.

22:57.930 --> 22:59.771
You are hung over.

22:59.773 --> 23:02.336
I should never have
taken your bloody money.

23:02.361 --> 23:04.279
Why don't you look at
me when I talk to you?

23:04.281 --> 23:06.578
Are you even listening to me?

23:06.580 --> 23:10.048
I won't be silenced. Not even by you.

23:10.050 --> 23:12.050
Get the girls inside.

23:12.052 --> 23:13.525
- What?
- What?

23:16.005 --> 23:18.575
Take the girls inside.

23:18.600 --> 23:19.719
Now!

23:23.129 --> 23:25.197
Girls, run!

23:55.911 --> 23:58.396
Stand by. Stand by.

23:58.398 --> 24:00.160
Ready.

24:00.185 --> 24:01.617
Ready.

24:01.642 --> 24:05.216
3... 2... 1... execute.

24:09.458 --> 24:12.539
One minute till the next breach.

24:12.564 --> 24:13.964
You're a college boy.

24:13.989 --> 24:15.556
You know that to every action,

24:15.581 --> 24:17.386
there's an equal and
opposite reaction, right?

24:17.388 --> 24:19.550
Yes. Newton's Third Law of Motion.

24:19.552 --> 24:21.887
That was way too much reaction.

24:21.889 --> 24:24.523
You're using an ax where you
should be using a scalpel.

24:24.525 --> 24:25.891
Let's do another one.

24:25.893 --> 24:27.725
The new guy's not gonna cut it.

24:27.727 --> 24:29.661
A dozen oyster shooters
says you're wrong.

24:29.663 --> 24:33.497
Stop. It's not all about the power.

24:33.499 --> 24:35.966
It's also about the placement.

24:35.968 --> 24:38.836
You have to think about
the breaching problem.

24:38.838 --> 24:41.539
Read the door. Come on.
Read the door, Chase.

24:41.541 --> 24:44.171
Well, how about you tell me
exactly what I did wrong, Ortiz,

24:44.196 --> 24:46.029
and I'll fix it.

24:46.579 --> 24:49.447
You figure it out, smart guy.

24:49.449 --> 24:50.909
Smart, dead guy.

24:57.823 --> 25:00.741
Laying it on him kind of
thick, don't you think, Buddha?

25:00.766 --> 25:02.426
The kid's good, way better than you.

25:02.428 --> 25:03.995
Of course, it wouldn't take much.

25:03.997 --> 25:06.030
Still got some habits from his old team.

25:06.032 --> 25:08.954
I have two more weeks.
I'll have him ready to go.

25:08.979 --> 25:10.949
You're really going through with this.

25:10.974 --> 25:12.570
Yeah. Got some papers to sign, bro.

25:12.572 --> 25:16.007
So, sign them and get
the hell out of here.

25:22.064 --> 25:24.368
Yeah, whatever you say, boss.

25:29.256 --> 25:31.407
That was good, Bear, real motivational.

25:31.432 --> 25:33.106
You want Buddha to
change his mind and stay,

25:33.130 --> 25:34.902
you might want to show
the guy a little love.

25:39.416 --> 25:41.799
Got it.

25:41.801 --> 25:43.617
Buy him a beer, dude,
take him out for dinner.

25:44.754 --> 25:46.137
The last hour, we've seen

25:46.139 --> 25:49.007
several apparently
coordinated attacks...

25:49.009 --> 25:51.475
on a movie theater in Istanbul,

25:51.477 --> 25:53.911
on an Army training facility in Jakarta,

25:53.913 --> 25:55.646
and our embassy in Tanzania...

25:55.648 --> 25:57.548
small teams using state-of-the-art gear

25:57.550 --> 25:59.550
and highly organized
command and control.

25:59.552 --> 26:02.653
These were like Paris 2.0.
Could be an ISIS affiliate.

26:02.655 --> 26:04.488
Could be A.Q. Could be independent.

26:04.490 --> 26:06.624
Bottom line... these guys
appear to be well-trained,

26:06.626 --> 26:08.630
with a degree of coordination
we haven't seen before.

26:08.632 --> 26:10.494
All right, there's one more thing,

26:10.496 --> 26:12.596
apparently unrelated.

26:12.598 --> 26:15.132
24 hours ago, armed men
assaulted a girls' school

26:15.134 --> 26:18.636
80 miles northwest of
Benin City, Nigeria.

26:18.638 --> 26:20.205
Hostages were taken...

26:20.207 --> 26:22.908
a teacher, a couple dozen school girls.

26:22.910 --> 26:26.478
They killed an American security
contractor and a videographer

26:26.480 --> 26:29.480
and posted some of his
photos on their website.

26:29.482 --> 26:31.115
I got some bad news.

26:31.117 --> 26:33.584
They also captured Richard Taggart,

26:33.586 --> 26:36.020
former troop chief of this command,

26:36.022 --> 26:40.090
who apparently was working for
the same private contractor.

26:40.092 --> 26:42.526
As of now, Rip has not been I.D.'d

26:42.528 --> 26:44.061
as a former member of SEAL Team Six.

26:44.063 --> 26:45.290
And I don't have to say

26:45.315 --> 26:47.798
how much personal danger
that would put him in

26:47.800 --> 26:49.277
or how much of a security risk

26:49.302 --> 26:50.873
knowing what he knows he would be.

26:50.875 --> 26:52.636
Sir, who has him?

26:52.638 --> 26:54.639
Boko Haram. Right, Lieutenant?

26:54.641 --> 26:57.174
Kidnapping schoolchildren
is one of their M.O.s.

26:57.176 --> 27:00.478
Boko Haram is Africa's
largest terrorist organization.

27:00.480 --> 27:01.667
They don't mess around.

27:01.692 --> 27:03.751
They killed more people
last year than ISIS did.

27:03.753 --> 27:05.616
We're tracking an HVT, a courier

27:05.641 --> 27:07.759
with intimate knowledge
of Boko Haram's operations.

27:07.784 --> 27:09.086
He may know where Rip is.

27:09.088 --> 27:11.722
SIGINT has him headed to
a meeting in Lagos Harbour.

27:11.724 --> 27:14.058
All right, White Squadron,
we're on the hook for this.

27:14.060 --> 27:15.753
Sir, my team wants that mission.

27:15.778 --> 27:18.312
I already tasked you with it.
You guys are on a short leash

27:18.337 --> 27:19.870
while we develop the target package.

27:19.895 --> 27:22.112
One hour recall till further notice.

27:29.993 --> 27:32.009
I didn't know Rip was
in Africa, did you?

27:32.011 --> 27:33.644
Had no idea.

27:33.646 --> 27:35.813
Must be making a
killing on his contracts.

27:35.815 --> 27:38.549
Hey, we should talk about this later.

27:38.551 --> 27:40.167
Hey, Bear, did you
know he was in Africa?

27:41.838 --> 27:43.087
Let him go, Bear.

27:43.089 --> 27:44.271
This is on you.

27:44.296 --> 27:46.060
He was there because of you.

27:46.062 --> 27:47.892
Hey, Joe. Joe, let him go.

27:47.894 --> 27:50.561
Joe! Joe!

27:52.164 --> 27:53.764
It's not his fault.

27:53.766 --> 27:56.901
It's not anybody's fault. It just is.

27:56.903 --> 28:00.604
Now, we're gonna fix this
because that's what we do.

28:00.606 --> 28:02.273
We're gonna bring Rip back home.

28:02.275 --> 28:04.227
Hmm?

28:11.700 --> 28:14.151
- You okay?
- Mm-hmm.

28:14.153 --> 28:16.070
What the hell was that about, Ortiz?

28:16.095 --> 28:18.155
We don't get to know, do we, Buddha?

28:18.157 --> 28:19.790
- Know what?
- What really happened

28:19.792 --> 28:21.892
in Afghanistan, why Rip got out so fast.

28:21.894 --> 28:25.162
Rip got out because he
had personal problems.

28:25.164 --> 28:27.965
His wife left him and
cleaned out his bank account.

28:27.967 --> 28:30.521
There you go. Happy now?

28:44.769 --> 28:46.686
Joseph.

28:46.688 --> 28:48.273
Honey?

28:50.509 --> 28:53.626
Hey.

28:56.331 --> 28:58.331
I'm gonna go inside and clean up.

28:58.333 --> 28:59.741
We'll eat in half an hour.

28:59.766 --> 29:01.586
All right.

29:03.755 --> 29:07.808
Dear God, bless this food to our use

29:07.810 --> 29:09.676
and us to Thy service.

29:09.678 --> 29:12.348
In Christ's name. Amen.

29:12.373 --> 29:13.891
Amen.

29:16.634 --> 29:20.820
You want to know what I was praying for?

29:20.822 --> 29:22.855
The bathroom door's sticking.

29:22.857 --> 29:26.327
I can re-hang it.

29:26.329 --> 29:30.396
Forget about fixing the house, Joe.

29:30.398 --> 29:34.267
It's been a year since Sarah died.

29:34.269 --> 29:37.870
Remember how many kids
you told me you wanted?

29:37.872 --> 29:41.266
Four. And now we just want one.

29:42.827 --> 29:45.411
I need a baby.

29:45.413 --> 29:47.914
And so do you.

29:47.916 --> 29:52.352
And with how long it took before...

29:52.354 --> 29:55.255
I'm making an appointment
with a specialist.

29:55.257 --> 29:56.689
Those doctors... we can't afford it.

29:56.691 --> 29:59.326
- It's not about the money.
- It will be!

29:59.328 --> 30:01.713
It will be.

30:06.484 --> 30:10.870
Look, after dinner, go
out to your workshop.

30:10.872 --> 30:14.941
Get out the plans for
the crib you built Sarah.

30:14.943 --> 30:16.495
It's time to build a new one.

30:20.854 --> 30:23.283
Hey. It's Ricky. Any updates?

30:23.285 --> 30:27.020
Yeah, man, I'm sitting
tight. That's all I'm doing.

30:27.022 --> 30:28.321
Okay.

30:30.358 --> 30:31.658
Go on in.

30:31.660 --> 30:33.459
Hey.

30:33.461 --> 30:35.395
Ricky. Why are you here?

30:35.397 --> 30:36.996
Hmm?

30:36.998 --> 30:38.569
- Here, baby. Put this in your room.
- Okay.

30:38.571 --> 30:40.701
You said you wanted to be
a part of things, right?

30:40.703 --> 30:42.903
- Yeah.
- So?

30:42.905 --> 30:45.606
Anabel? Her dance class?

30:45.631 --> 30:47.285
- Oh, oh.
- You said you'd pick her up!

30:47.310 --> 30:48.508
Yeah.

30:48.510 --> 30:50.010
Move, move, move. Let's go.

30:50.012 --> 30:51.515
- Yeah.
- Let's go. You're gonna be late.

30:51.517 --> 30:54.614
No, I got it, got it, got it.

30:54.616 --> 30:56.416
Oh, man.

31:19.090 --> 31:21.407
Wow. That was amazing.

31:21.409 --> 31:22.875
You've gotten so good.

31:22.877 --> 31:25.812
You didn't even see me. Where's Mom?

31:25.814 --> 31:28.667
Uh, I-I thought I'd pick you up.

31:30.469 --> 31:32.019
Do you want to get some ice cream?

31:32.021 --> 31:36.357
I'm lactose intolerant. I
have been for, like, forever.

31:36.359 --> 31:37.476
You're what?

31:41.480 --> 31:43.896
Come on, Daddy. Let's get sorbet.

31:43.898 --> 31:45.518
Yeah.

31:52.391 --> 31:53.906
Lena said you were out here.

31:53.908 --> 31:55.608
What are you building?

31:55.610 --> 31:57.677
Separation gift for Buddha.

31:57.679 --> 31:59.846
That's funny. Lena said
you were making a new crib.

31:59.848 --> 32:01.781
What's on your mind?

32:01.783 --> 32:03.816
I'm just as mad about Rip as you are,

32:03.818 --> 32:06.419
so I'm not gonna take
your shit personal.

32:06.421 --> 32:08.722
You should.

32:08.724 --> 32:10.623
Rip crossed the line.
He lost his self-control.

32:10.625 --> 32:12.764
The only line that I care
about is between good and evil,

32:12.766 --> 32:14.261
and Rip was on the side of good.

32:14.286 --> 32:15.932
You've seen everything we've seen,

32:15.934 --> 32:17.001
and you still think it's that simple?

32:17.003 --> 32:18.766
You betrayed your troop chief.

32:18.768 --> 32:20.533
You might as well have gut-shot him.

32:20.535 --> 32:22.702
I didn't tell Rip anything
he didn't know himself.

32:22.704 --> 32:24.221
That's why he left.

32:24.246 --> 32:26.410
You lose it like he did,
I'll do the same thing to you.

32:26.412 --> 32:27.745
Well, that's where you
and I are different.

32:27.747 --> 32:29.575
That's one way.

32:29.577 --> 32:31.811
If Rip's alive, we'll get him.

32:31.813 --> 32:33.946
We got to work together, so we will.

32:33.948 --> 32:36.082
You got my back, I got yours.

32:36.084 --> 32:38.050
But...

32:38.052 --> 32:41.406
you come at me like that again,
you better finish the job.

32:48.663 --> 32:50.129
Get off of me!

32:52.600 --> 32:55.601
No!

32:55.603 --> 32:57.837
Hey! Hey!

32:57.839 --> 32:59.439
Hey!!

33:22.464 --> 33:25.998
- What did he say to you?
- He's saving me for his boss.

33:26.000 --> 33:28.647
Get up!

33:39.964 --> 33:42.915
No! Where are you taking them?

33:42.917 --> 33:44.917
Miss Na'omi! Wait!

33:44.919 --> 33:47.854
Where are you taking them?

33:47.856 --> 33:51.544
Pray. Be strong and pray.

33:55.079 --> 33:56.496
Pray.

34:08.907 --> 34:10.201
It won't close, okay?

34:10.226 --> 34:11.947
Okay. Let me see.

34:11.949 --> 34:13.447
Uh, leave it unbuttoned.

34:13.449 --> 34:16.083
- The tie should cover it up.
- Too much Taco Bell.

34:16.085 --> 34:18.587
You won't laugh when I pawn
your phone to pay your tuition.

34:20.291 --> 34:22.357
I'll get it!

34:22.359 --> 34:24.059
Remember to ask about
the tuition plan...

34:24.061 --> 34:26.027
does it cover Anabel and Ricky Jr.?

34:26.030 --> 34:27.896
You only told me, what, five times?

34:27.898 --> 34:31.099
At least six.

34:31.101 --> 34:34.036
Hey.

34:34.039 --> 34:36.085
Is this, uh... Is this a bad time?

34:37.290 --> 34:39.373
Is it, Ricky?

34:39.376 --> 34:41.510
Is it a bad time?

34:41.512 --> 34:44.197
It'll... It'll just take a... a minute.

34:46.967 --> 34:48.402
A minute.

34:52.539 --> 34:56.523
So, the... the necklace I
got for Anabel... she like it?

34:56.547 --> 34:57.593
Yeah. Won't take it off.

34:57.595 --> 34:59.499
- Picked her up at ballet today.
- Look, I got ask...

34:59.501 --> 35:02.131
you sign your separation papers yet?

35:02.133 --> 35:03.566
I was about to.

35:03.568 --> 35:05.468
We can't get Rip if you're not there.

35:05.470 --> 35:08.470
The new guy is not ready, okay?

35:08.472 --> 35:11.874
And I don't know if I can handle
Caulder's bullshit without you.

35:11.876 --> 35:15.244
Yeah?

35:15.246 --> 35:16.912
Bear...

35:16.914 --> 35:19.047
I don't have a choice, man.

35:19.049 --> 35:21.379
Anabel's school deposit
is due next month.

35:21.404 --> 35:22.517
I have to take this job.

35:22.519 --> 35:25.020
I know this is a tough
call for you, all right?

35:25.022 --> 35:27.943
One more time. That's all I'm asking.

35:43.508 --> 35:46.408
Oh, man.

35:52.683 --> 35:54.383
Hey!

35:54.385 --> 35:57.419
Congratulations. You owe me more money.

35:57.421 --> 35:59.243
If you don't get
current on your payments,

35:59.268 --> 36:00.622
it's called contempt of court.

36:00.624 --> 36:03.258
Dharma, this man's your father,
in case you don't recognize him.

36:03.260 --> 36:05.560
- I know it's been a while.
- Why didn't you wait for me?

36:05.585 --> 36:07.571
We'll just add it to
everything else in her life

36:07.573 --> 36:09.032
that you missed.

36:09.034 --> 36:10.533
By the way, your lawyer quit.

36:13.505 --> 36:15.405
Dharma, that's his dog whistle.

36:15.407 --> 36:17.307
It's time for your father to disappear.

36:17.309 --> 36:20.261
- I'll take care of this!
- Sure you will, Alex.

36:26.300 --> 36:28.350
Global Structure Security
is an international firm

36:28.352 --> 36:30.519
based in 52 countries.

36:30.521 --> 36:33.989
Uh, we run an elite service for
our private security clients.

36:33.991 --> 36:36.291
As you know, our team is
based in SEAL principles,

36:36.293 --> 36:38.227
but of course not with SEAL salaries.

36:38.229 --> 36:40.463
Now, you'll be very pleased
with your take-home pay.

36:40.465 --> 36:44.066
- Your clearance up to date?
- Yeah, of course.

36:44.068 --> 36:46.101
About the benefit package...

36:46.103 --> 36:49.338
I hear you have, uh, a
tuition assistance plan?

36:49.340 --> 36:52.741
Correct... for approved
educational institutions.

36:52.743 --> 36:56.111
Now, if you don't have
any other questions for me,

36:56.113 --> 36:59.114
I have one for you.

36:59.116 --> 37:00.401
When can you start?

37:09.059 --> 37:11.526
Goddamned media outing Rip like that.

37:11.528 --> 37:13.432
- Who the hell told them?
- They were bound to find out.

37:13.434 --> 37:15.097
It doesn't change anything for us.

37:15.099 --> 37:17.065
It means we need to
get our asses in gear,

37:17.067 --> 37:19.338
or pieces of Rip are gonna be
hanging from a bridge somewhere.

37:19.340 --> 37:21.103
Chase, you got everything?

37:21.105 --> 37:22.275
- Yeah.
- You got the initiators?

37:22.277 --> 37:23.275
- Four kinds.
- What about the non-el?

37:23.277 --> 37:24.506
Hey, cut the kid some slack.

37:24.508 --> 37:26.541
It's not his first day of kindergarten.

37:26.543 --> 37:29.064
We got to go wheels up.
Give the guys the word.

37:31.564 --> 37:33.015
Let it go, Bear.

37:33.017 --> 37:36.485
We're all on our own path.

37:36.487 --> 37:39.187
Buddha's path is just out of here.

37:46.714 --> 37:49.231
It's just till we get
Rip back. I owe him, okay?

37:49.233 --> 37:51.233
You owe us. This school...

37:51.235 --> 37:53.168
Anabel's been dreaming
about it since she was 6.

37:53.170 --> 37:55.238
I know. I know. It will
all work out somehow.

37:55.240 --> 37:57.573
How? You gonna sell Ricky Jr.?

37:57.575 --> 37:59.408
You spent our savings
on the quinceañera.

37:59.410 --> 38:00.679
And don't even say that
you're gonna sell the house,

38:00.681 --> 38:02.244
because our mortgage is underwater.

38:02.246 --> 38:04.046
All right, calmate, bonita.

38:04.048 --> 38:06.490
I will take care of it when
I get back. That's what I do.

38:06.515 --> 38:08.050
That's what you're supposed to do...

38:08.052 --> 38:09.618
take care of us.

38:09.620 --> 38:12.593
But you're not even doing that.

38:12.618 --> 38:15.128
Tell the kids I'll be
back in a week, maybe less.

38:15.130 --> 38:16.325
You tell them.

38:16.327 --> 38:20.315
Hey... I love you.

38:25.452 --> 38:27.621
Come home to me, Ricky.

38:29.289 --> 38:31.158
I always do.

39:12.332 --> 39:14.483
You're late.

39:14.485 --> 39:16.551
We gonna do this,

39:16.553 --> 39:18.506
or are we just gonna talk about it?

39:51.671 --> 39:55.416
- Who's that?
- I want to go home, please.

39:55.441 --> 39:57.159
No!

39:58.777 --> 39:59.629
He was a threat.

39:59.631 --> 40:01.666
He surrendered. He was an American.

40:01.691 --> 40:03.431
He's not a goddamn American.

40:11.008 --> 40:14.227
That's the man who killed my brother.
