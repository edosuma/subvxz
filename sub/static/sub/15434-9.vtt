00:00.730 --> 00:02.719
Previously on "brothers & sisters"...

00:03.580 --> 00:05.530
Just getting in from your date?

00:05.590 --> 00:07.360
Rebecca is my father's daughter.

00:07.420 --> 00:08.530
She's not.

00:08.590 --> 00:13.960
Then why did he adding her initials to ours unlock 
the accounts I have been trying to open for months?

00:14.010 --> 00:18.260
If he knew I was having his child,
he would be compelled to leave you all,

00:18.310 --> 00:21.600
and I couldn't have that.
So I told him it was someone else's.

00:21.660 --> 00:23.620
Kevin,I just got a registered 
letter from the army.

00:23.620 --> 00:24.970
What does it say,justin?

00:25.025 --> 00:27.810
They want me back. 
Not going back is a felony.

00:27.860 --> 00:30.424
I don't care.I'm going to mexico.

00:30.477 --> 00:31.646
Justin!

00:31.646 --> 00:33.146
- What do you need? 
- Uh,the usual.

00:33.239 --> 00:34.911
justin,wake up! 
-This is all my fault.

00:34.968 --> 00:36.933
It's his own fault. 
-We need an ambulance right away.

00:37.008 --> 00:40.692
No, justin. Justin.
Oh, justin, please.

00:41.125 --> 00:43.561
We're in your hands,lord.

00:43.605 --> 00:45.510
Look after us.

00:45.567 --> 00:50.403
Amen.

00:50.767 --> 00:52.872
Here, will you pass that?

00:55.498 --> 00:56.693
hold your plate.

00:56.767 --> 00:58.841
Justin, what's the matter?

00:58.947 --> 01:01.450
Uh, nothing's the matter.

01:01.785 --> 01:03.933
You want to say something?

01:03.986 --> 01:06.493
I,uh...

01:06.556 --> 01:09.030
I enlisted today.

01:10.698 --> 01:12.212
Enlisted in what?

01:12.285 --> 01:14.711
In the military.

01:14.766 --> 01:18.003
Is this like that time you wanted 
to be a roadie for linkin park?

01:18.076 --> 01:20.931
-Yeah,or open the brewery? 
-or the karate school?

01:20.975 --> 01:23.601
-oh,dude,it's called a dojo. 
-Guys,I'm serious.

01:23.645 --> 01:25.573
I went to the recruitment office 
today,and I joined the army.

01:25.616 --> 01:29.863
As in the army,the actual army-- 
the guys with missiles and tanks?

01:30.168 --> 01:33.102
Yeah,look,it's--it's too soon 
to be making jokes. -yeah,it is.

01:33.157 --> 01:34.593
He's not joking.

01:34.646 --> 01:38.321
Look,the recruiter says we're getting a 
lot of volunteers,and,you know,we can--

01:38.386 --> 01:40.563
No,I'm sorry,but no.

01:40.615 --> 01:42.262
No what,mom?

01:42.317 --> 01:43.900
You're not going.

01:43.977 --> 01:47.180
Dad,will you just explain to her-- I 
understand wanting to serve your country.

01:47.227 --> 01:49.361
It's a noble instinct.

01:49.415 --> 01:52.340
Look,it's not an instinct.I'm doing 
this,okay?No one's gonna stop me.

01:52.386 --> 01:54.542
The hell I'm not.

01:54.598 --> 01:57.281
I will not have a child of mine 
putting themselves in harm's way 

01:57.327 --> 02:00.273
just because they're caught 
up in some nationalistic fever.

02:00.368 --> 02:02.552
Look,I may be your son,but 
I'm not your child anymore.

02:02.608 --> 02:04.600
I mean,I'm an adult,and I 
can make my own decisions.

02:04.658 --> 02:06.773
Come on,justin.You don't even 
carry your own credit cards.

02:06.845 --> 02:09.293
You really think you're 
old enough to carry a gun?

02:09.326 --> 02:12.271
Look,I'm three years older than 
dad was when he joined the army.

02:12.337 --> 02:14.872
Justin,that was a completely 
different time.

02:14.945 --> 02:16.262
You know what,kitty?
We talked about this.

02:16.336 --> 02:18.982
I mean,you said yourself that we need 
to do something and that we're not safe.

02:19.026 --> 02:23.152
Justin,she's a radio personality.Half 
of what she says she doesn't mean.

02:23.195 --> 02:25.302
You're serious about this?

02:28.757 --> 02:33.080
I bought a plane ticket,and I'm 
reporting to fort bragg next friday.

02:36.936 --> 02:39.020
Then godspeed.

02:39.065 --> 02:40.343
what?Dad!

02:40.406 --> 02:43.260
-You can't -- what?

02:45.468 --> 02:52.311
Mom?

02:52.358 --> 02:53.542
What?

02:53.615 --> 02:54.821
Are you okay?

02:54.917 --> 02:58.323
Yes.I'm just making my market 
list for thanksgiving.

02:58.375 --> 03:00.030
thanksgiving's a week away.

03:00.085 --> 03:02.362
Yes,I know.But when I'm nervous,
I like to make lists.

03:02.416 --> 03:04.742
Oh,mom,he's-- he's gonna be fine.

03:04.786 --> 03:06.241
I know.

03:06.288 --> 03:08.082
Doctor's here.

03:12.985 --> 03:14.750
He's gonna be okay. -really?

03:14.818 --> 03:17.683
We pumd his stomach,gave him 
some medicine called naloxone.

03:17.698 --> 03:20.471
It's gonna keep him pretty out 
of it for the next 24 to 48 hours,

03:20.535 --> 03:22.462
but,uh,he should make a full recovery.

03:22.528 --> 03:26.380
Thank you,doctor.You--you are a 
doctor,aren't you?You look so young.

03:26.428 --> 03:28.403
Well,he looks-- I'll discharge him tomorrow.

03:28.466 --> 03:29.983
Uh,what's his living situation like?

03:30.045 --> 03:31.693
-Uh,he's gonna come home with us. 
-Good,good.

03:31.766 --> 03:34.383
You're gonna want to keep a close 
watch on him for the next few days.

03:34.458 --> 03:37.212
Also I'm recommending the 
following rehab facilities.

03:37.286 --> 03:40.052
thank you very much.

03:40.125 --> 03:42.190
"New horizons"?

03:42.277 --> 03:43.963
"Sunset acres"...

03:44.017 --> 03:47.753
"bradley Ridge detox & spa"...

03:47.788 --> 03:50.821
maybe we can get a family rate.

03:51.357 --> 03:57.290
Using the password,we discovered your father's account at 
Ricklean and Cabot contains 50 shares of a holding company.

03:57.346 --> 03:58.372
Holding what?

03:58.428 --> 04:01.113
A 60-acre parcel of 
land near furth,nevada.

04:01.166 --> 04:03.792
Basically,it's in the 
middle of the desert.

04:03.856 --> 04:06.840
We're estimating its market value 
at less than $1.2 million.

04:06.877 --> 04:10.610
If the land's only worth a million,where's 
the other $14 million my father borrowed?

04:10.666 --> 04:15.790
The land is worth $1.2 million,but it looks 
like your father paid someone 15 for it.

04:15.847 --> 04:19.680
Great.So he'd have been better off buying 
swaland in florida or a bridge in brooklyn.

04:19.728 --> 04:21.952
Thank you,jordan,for your diligence.

04:22.026 --> 04:25.441
Why don't you step into my office,and 
I'll give you a check for your services?

04:25.516 --> 04:27.080
With any luck,it won't bounce. 

04:27.125 --> 04:28.353
thank you.

04:28.405 --> 04:30.802
Yeah,thanks.

04:31.097 --> 04:33.930
Well,I know a firm in nevada.Maybe 
they could recommend a good realtor.

04:33.967 --> 04:35.423
Give them a call. -No.

04:35.495 --> 04:37.900
I don't want to sell it,not yet.

04:37.958 --> 04:40.741
Look,whatever dad might 
have been,he wasn't stupid.

04:40.776 --> 04:42.560
He knew land.

04:42.606 --> 04:44.531
He bought the orchards up 
and down the west coast.

04:44.588 --> 04:47.122
Well,maybe his judgment failed him 
when he moved his investments inland.

04:47.177 --> 04:48.190
R ight.

04:48.198 --> 04:51.131
I'm not signing off on 
any sale until I see it.

04:51.187 --> 04:56.740
As  V.P.He does have to consent the conveyance 
of any corporate asset valued over a million.

04:56.808 --> 05:00.111
Well,I'm a mother of two,and I'm responsible 
for the candied yams at thanksgiving.

05:00.165 --> 05:02.270
I don't have time to road trip to nevada.

05:02.315 --> 05:06.030
Sarah,it's five hours each way.We'll leave 
early tomorrow.We'll be back by dinner.

05:06.106 --> 05:10.290
And as company president,you do have a fiduciary 
obligation to make an informed decision.

05:10.338 --> 05:11.771
No,I don'T. -Yeah,you do.

05:11.826 --> 05:15.373
Stop saying legal things 
just to piss me off.

05:18.007 --> 05:20.142
okay.If I'm going,you're going.

05:20.178 --> 05:21.482
Fine.I love road trips.

05:21.548 --> 05:23.360
And you're driving. -Still love 'em.

05:23.405 --> 05:25.941
Both ways. -I hate road trips.

05:25.996 --> 05:29.151
you gotta box him in.You gotta ask him 
about U.N.Sanctions for north korea.

05:29.166 --> 05:30.233
Stem cell research.

05:30.238 --> 05:32.872
You gotta ask him about-- you guys know 
that this is only a 15-minute interview?

05:32.925 --> 05:34.771
You better ask the senator about his divorce.

05:34.828 --> 05:36.781
What is this,interview by committee?

05:36.835 --> 05:39.270
It's mccallister's first interview 
since splitting from his wife,

05:39.327 --> 05:43.810
and he shouldn't get a free pass just because he's 
being interviewed by a fellow california republican.

05:43.878 --> 05:45.553
Divorce  is not news.

05:45.585 --> 05:48.532
Messy divorces are news,
and this one was messy.

05:48.588 --> 05:52.070
I mean,the guy's the best-looking man 
in a 20-square-mile radius of D.C.

05:52.125 --> 05:53.992
,And his wife left him 
for his chief of staff.

05:54.038 --> 05:55.963
After she found him in bed with the nanny.

05:56.017 --> 05:57.611
Yeah,so she says.The nanny denies it.

05:57.655 --> 05:59.220
See?News.

05:59.278 --> 06:02.751
He's a decorated vet of the 
first gulf war,2-term senator

06:02.777 --> 06:06.240
and,not to mention,front-runner 
for vice presidency.

06:06.305 --> 06:10.310
Yes,of course I'm going to 
ask him about his divorce.

06:10.368 --> 06:12.562
Knock 'em dead.

06:16.037 --> 06:17.443
You okay?

06:17.507 --> 06:21.013
There's been some talk around these parts 
of you finally acting like a republican.

06:21.047 --> 06:23.831
Oh,you mean bitchy?

06:23.887 --> 06:26.510
You said it, not me.

06:26.555 --> 06:28.572
it's my brother Justin.

06:28.626 --> 06:31.970
They called him up,and they're 
sending him to iraq this time.

06:32.026 --> 06:34.950
Oh,god,kitty.I'm sorry.

06:36.177 --> 06:38.213
Is there anything I can do for you?

06:38.218 --> 06:41.890
Yeah,you can find a way 
to withdraw from iraq.

06:41.890 --> 06:44.874
Come here. -Oh,thanks.

06:44.957 --> 06:47.876
Kitty,Whit wants you to ask 
senator McCallister abouhis...

06:48.706 --> 06:50.636
I can wait.

06:50.639 --> 06:53.640
Amber,it's-- oh,god.

06:59.956 --> 07:02.000
I'll go to your loft and 
get you some clothes.

07:02.037 --> 07:04.811
Matter of fact, I think 
I'll take everything.

07:04.855 --> 07:08.383
From the looks of things,they haven't seen 
the inside of a washer or dryer in months.

07:08.415 --> 07:10.642
I could stop by the video store.
You want me to pick you up anything?

07:10.687 --> 07:13.061
Yeah,"black hawk down".

07:13.586 --> 07:16.841
" Nice to see attempting suicide 
has not hurt your sense of humor.

07:16.906 --> 07:19.641
Look,I didn't "attempt" anything, mom.

07:19.696 --> 07:22.400
It's called an overdose 
because I overdid it.

07:22.427 --> 07:24.640
Why don't you just tear my 
head off and get it over with?

07:24.686 --> 07:25.990
Go upstairs.Lay down.

07:26.045 --> 07:29.030
When you feel better,then I'll 
tear your head off,I promise.

07:33.987 --> 07:38.131
mom?

07:39.187 --> 07:40.813
Nora...

07:40.856 --> 07:43.043
I hate it when you do that.

07:43.058 --> 07:46.612
You're not the final say in this house,
not when it comes to my children.

07:46.656 --> 07:49.403
His mind is made up. -No,it's not!

07:49.465 --> 07:51.950
You have to talk to him.
He's not ready for this.

07:51.995 --> 07:55.293
Neither was I! -William,
he is not you.

07:55.366 --> 08:00.080
He doesn't have your strengths.
He doesn't have your capability.

08:04.567 --> 08:07.422
I'm doing this.

08:07.425 --> 08:10.841
I'm going,mom,and there's 
nothing you can do to stop me.

08:48.115 --> 08:50.640
When did ojai foods get into 
the pie-making business?

08:50.705 --> 08:53.110
What do you think,these pies 
bake themselves every year?

08:53.215 --> 08:58.572
No I do the baking today,and then the cooking,
stuffing and potato mashing on the day of.

08:58.616 --> 09:02.333
Besides that,I just wanted this 
to be a special thanksgiving.

09:02.366 --> 09:06.703
It's the first one without your father 
and the last one before justin...

09:06.718 --> 09:09.332
I just wanted to bring my "a"...

09:09.415 --> 09:12.602
something. -Game.

09:12.658 --> 09:14.763
So I have an interview 
with senator McCallister,

09:14.815 --> 09:17.522
but then when I come back,
I'd--I'd love to help.

09:17.587 --> 09:22.942
Oh,kitty,sweetie pie,I don't know how to say 
this delicately,but I'm not cremating anything.

09:22.988 --> 09:24.722
You know,I am an excellent cook.

09:24.786 --> 09:26.711
In fact,some people 
even call me a chef.

09:26.778 --> 09:29.482
Some with a really 
good sense of humor.

09:30.135 --> 09:32.022
So...

09:32.188 --> 09:34.210
you're okay?We're okay?

09:34.245 --> 09:37.120
I'm okay,and we're...

09:37.176 --> 09:39.412
more than okay.

09:39.465 --> 09:42.210
Just go do your mccallister interview,

09:42.268 --> 09:44.363
and don't forget to ask him 
if he slept with the nanny.

09:44.415 --> 09:46.063
Oh,mother,not you.

09:46.138 --> 09:47.523
It's not news.

09:47.558 --> 09:50.121
No,no,no,but it's very interesting.

09:51.277 --> 09:53.260
"Interesting"?

10:11.286 --> 10:13.440
aw,mom...

10:13.497 --> 10:16.142
you don't always have to be strong.

10:16.426 --> 10:19.183
I'm not.

10:20.188 --> 10:23.850
They're gonna take my-- my boy.

10:23.918 --> 10:25.943
No,no.We're gonna do something.

10:25.975 --> 10:27.730
Kevin's gonna-- kevin's gonna do something.

10:27.785 --> 10:30.911
No,he came by earlier this morning,

10:30.948 --> 10:37.241
about four pies ago,and there's nothing 
he can do to keep justin out of it.

10:37.268 --> 10:39.553
Are you sure?

10:39.605 --> 10:45.350
Yes.He has to report in--in two weeks,
or they're going to arrest him.

10:45.646 --> 10:49.150
I don't know how I can do this again.

10:49.208 --> 10:51.823
I was afraid to answer the phone.

10:51.875 --> 10:54.801
I was afraid they were 
calling to say that...

10:54.866 --> 10:57.653
I don't know...

10:58.585 --> 11:03.710
god,how many times will 
I have to lose my boy?

11:17.245 --> 11:21.340
oh,this is ridiculous-- country,
light country...and static.

11:21.357 --> 11:24.271
-Pick the static. 
-What cds do you have?

11:26.488 --> 11:28.682
kevin,you are such a cliche.

11:28.747 --> 11:30.572
What did you expect-- ludacris?

11:30.635 --> 11:32.610
okay,"apocalypse now".

11:32.688 --> 11:34.281
Is that a band?

11:34.375 --> 11:38.682
Cinema. Last man standing gets to 
control the dial for the whole trip.

11:38.717 --> 11:40.273
Uh,"Whale rider".

11:40.326 --> 11:42.810
"Apocalypse now" ends with
a "w"so "whale rider".

11:42.877 --> 11:45.860
A movie that starts 
with "r" kev go

11:45.916 --> 11:48.342
-I know the rules,einstein. 
-Oh,just go.

11:48.416 --> 11:50.030
"Rambo: First blood part 2".

11:50.076 --> 11:52.692
No sequels.How am I gonna come up 
with a movie that begins with a "2"?

11:52.746 --> 11:56.642
"2 fast 2 furious". 
"2001: A space odyssey".

11:56.686 --> 12:00.081
What's that smoke? -I don't think that's a 
movie,and it certainly doesn't start with a "2".

12:00.148 --> 12:03.330
No,there is smoke pouring 
out the front of your hood.

12:04.836 --> 12:07.521
It's okay.I have this 
under control...

12:07.555 --> 12:10.660
If only to prove to you 
two I'm not a cliche.

12:14.636 --> 12:16.470
No one panic.

12:18.068 --> 12:20.252
I'll stretch my legs.

12:28.997 --> 12:30.760
He's gonna get himself killed.

12:30.847 --> 12:33.483
He's pouring water into the 
radiator.He'll be fine.

12:33.535 --> 12:35.920
I'm talking about justin.

12:36.007 --> 12:38.291
He can handle himself.He's not a baby.

12:38.368 --> 12:40.392
I  didn't say he was. 
-But you treat him like one.

12:40.458 --> 12:42.481
You all do.You all 
complain,and you worry,

12:42.535 --> 12:44.422
and you don't see that 
you're responsible.

12:44.458 --> 12:46.720
How am I responsible? 
-We all are.

12:46.795 --> 12:50.891
I mean,every self-destructive thing he's 
ever done,including enlisting in the military,

12:50.927 --> 12:55.342
he did to prove that he's not 
the baby of the family.

13:00.508 --> 13:03.933
Cliche that.

13:12.306 --> 13:14.172
you were saying?

13:17.495 --> 13:20.133
Excusese me. Um,senator McCallister,hi.

13:20.205 --> 13:22.163
I'm Kitty Walker. Call me Robert.

13:22.258 --> 13:24.052
Really? -Hell,no.

13:24.108 --> 13:27.283
I campaigned through a primary and a 
runoff so people call me "senator.

13:27.375 --> 13:28.780
guys,could you give me the room?

13:28.855 --> 13:34.151
I just came in to introduce myself before the 
interview,and is there anything else we can get you?

13:34.228 --> 13:37.201
Three more votes on my bill to stop 
federal funding of stem cell research.

13:37.286 --> 13:42.320
Oh,well,it's already been stopped for the last 
six years,except the existing cell lines.

13:42.386 --> 13:44.870
You're one of those republicans.

13:44.936 --> 13:48.230
why,because I happen to support federal 
funding for stem cell research?

13:48.287 --> 13:51.712
Because you support federal funding 
of issues which are not federal.

13:51.788 --> 13:54.660
You know,there's a reason the other guys keep 
saying our spending habits are out of control.

13:54.706 --> 13:57.053
Why is that? -They're right.

13:57.137 --> 14:01.232
I mean,why can't the states who are in favor of it 
fund it themselves?It's what we did in california.

14:01.296 --> 14:06.730
Well,I'm not sure that america is ready for us to run 
the country like we run california,not even californians.

14:06.778 --> 14:09.920
See?Isn't this much more fun than 
asking me about my divorce?

14:09.975 --> 14:13.710
I don't know.I haven't asked 
you about your divorce yet.

14:13.767 --> 14:15.981
Okay.

14:16.058 --> 14:17.781
I have an idea.

14:17.837 --> 14:20.582
How about instead of 
grilling me on my private 

14:20.647 --> 14:25.380
and intensely painful public divorce on national 
television,I take you out for an espresso?

14:25.387 --> 14:28.770
an espresso?

14:28.835 --> 14:33.492
Look,this is my first on-camera 
since courtney and I split.

14:33.526 --> 14:38.651
If I can get a bye here,it allows me to establish 
myself as a senator and not an ex-husband.

14:38.736 --> 14:41.383
Right,but you are a senator and an ex-husband.

14:41.455 --> 14:43.730
You should talk about both. -And I will. 

14:43.818 --> 14:46.752
But I promise you my thoughts on immigration 
won't be the pull-quote from the A.P.

14:46.817 --> 14:49.523
Or the clip downloaded on youtube.

14:49.588 --> 14:51.493
It'll be whatever you get 
me to say about bridgette.

14:51.567 --> 14:54.010
I'm assuming bridgette is the nanny?

14:54.075 --> 14:56.130
You've never been divorced,have you?

14:56.216 --> 14:58.270
No.

14:58.355 --> 15:02.563
Believe me,there are 
days when you wake up 

15:02.598 --> 15:07.763
feeling like a failure at the one thing you've 
worked your hardest at in your whole life,

15:07.807 --> 15:10.852
and  today's one of those days.

15:10.888 --> 15:12.601
Sorry.

15:12.636 --> 15:17.402
Come on,isn't there anything 
I can say to persuade you?

15:25.795 --> 15:28.241
it's the weirdest thing.
It--it just died.

15:28.305 --> 15:30.041
It didn't just die.
It overheated.

15:30.128 --> 15:32.660
You did something to it,
and then it died.

15:32.716 --> 15:34.540
You guys drive this thing 
into a lake or something?

15:34.598 --> 15:35.993
Engine's flooded...

15:36.045 --> 15:37.932
with water.With evian.

15:37.995 --> 15:39.232
Must have put it in the fill hole.

15:39.297 --> 15:42.410
-No gay jokes. 
-You poured water into the oil pan?

15:42.466 --> 15:44.393
How long is this gonna take to fix?

15:44.457 --> 15:46.441
Three,four hours,tops.

15:46.527 --> 15:47.770
Gonna have to flush the engine.

15:47.825 --> 15:49.481
There's a sandwich shop nearby.

15:49.528 --> 15:51.740
They make a mean patty melt.

15:51.806 --> 15:53.611
Oh,come on.That was an innocent mistake.

15:53.657 --> 15:55.593
You still love road trips?

15:55.598 --> 15:56.591
Hey,Joe. It's me.

15:56.596 --> 15:59.240
I'm gonna be a little 
longer than I thought.

16:00.397 --> 16:02.252
We'll do.

16:02.288 --> 16:05.753
Thank you very much.
That's all we have time for.

16:06.605 --> 16:07.891
and we're out.

16:07.978 --> 16:10.821
-so when does this air? 
-Tomorrow night.

16:10.887 --> 16:12.151
Don't worry.You were great.

16:12.215 --> 16:14.201
Thank you very much. Thank you.

16:14.258 --> 16:16.951
Take care. 
-You,too.

16:18.486 --> 16:19.880
good luck to your brother.

16:19.966 --> 16:21.812
Thank you.

16:26.676 --> 16:28.131
what was that?

16:28.186 --> 16:30.191
What was what? I thought it was great.

16:30.258 --> 16:33.421
Yeah,for him.Did you completely 
forget about the divorce?

16:33.517 --> 16:37.671
And "good luck to your brother"?
How does he even know about your brother?

16:38.367 --> 16:40.352
Oh,kitty.Tell me you didn't.

16:40.376 --> 16:41.502
Didn't what?

16:41.547 --> 16:43.941
Tell me you didn't ask the senator 
for a favor concerning your brother.

16:43.997 --> 16:47.983
Tell me you didn't jeopardize your integrity and 
the integrity of this program all in one fell swoop.

16:48.038 --> 16:49.151
Warren,that is-- just tell me you didn't.

16:49.207 --> 16:54.812
I didn't.

17:07.117 --> 17:08.412
what is this?

17:08.455 --> 17:10.421
It's a letter I downloaded 
off the internet.

17:10.484 --> 17:13.911
"After much consideration,I have 
decided to withdraw my choice of enlisting.

17:13.968 --> 17:16.230
Justin has decided to
withdraw his enlistment?

17:16.276 --> 17:18.960
All he needs to do is send that letter 
in before reporting for active duty.

17:19.026 --> 17:20.872
But actually hasn't sent it in yet.

17:20.948 --> 17:24.863
He won't do it if I ask him,
kitty.But he will if you ask him.

17:24.935 --> 17:27.151
No.No,mom. -Please.

17:27.224 --> 17:28.531
- No,I-I won't do it. 
- Please,please,please.

17:28.608 --> 17:30.040
He's making a terrible mistake.

17:30.125 --> 17:32.683
Well,I actually don't think 
that he is making a mistake.

17:32.755 --> 17:35.261
I--and if he is,well,then 
it's his mistake to make.

17:35.297 --> 17:38.273
You can't actually agree with him going 
off to war where he might get himself killed--

17:38.337 --> 17:40.183
oh,mom,we are not at war yet.

17:40.256 --> 17:42.021
Oh,please.We were attacked.

17:42.095 --> 17:45.060
This country's gonna bomb 
something.It's the American way.

17:45.095 --> 17:47.432
That's right,we were attacked.

17:47.488 --> 17:49.193
And now it's time to strike back,

17:49.266 --> 17:53.583
and I, for one, am very proud of Justin for being 
so patriotic that he wants to be a part of that.

17:53.615 --> 17:55.401
Kitty,this isn't your radio show.

17:55.447 --> 17:57.332
This is your brother 
we're talking about.

17:57.408 --> 18:01.632
How do you know that enlisting isn't 
actually going to be what he needs,mom?

18:01.698 --> 18:04.951
Dad is always talking about how 
the army taught him discipline.

18:05.026 --> 18:07.871
And what good is discipline if 
you're not alive to have it?

18:07.935 --> 18:11.401
Mom,this might just be what justin 
needs to turn his life around.

18:11.467 --> 18:14.521
There's a reason the greatest 
generation was a generation of veterans.

18:14.577 --> 18:16.492
It was different,kitty.
You said so yourself.

18:16.545 --> 18:18.853
How is it different?

18:18.928 --> 18:22.340
Our way of life is being attacked.

18:22.378 --> 18:27.010
Justin is just trying to protect and defend all of those 
rights that you taught us to value in the first place.

18:27.096 --> 18:28.852
I know what's right for my son.

18:28.905 --> 18:34.710
Well,I'm sorry,but I don't see it that way,
and more importantly,neither does justin.

18:34.788 --> 18:37.503
He just wants to be a part of something,mom.

18:37.565 --> 18:39.003
He is a part of something.

18:39.066 --> 18:43.913
He is a part of this family,and even 
if you don't appreciate that,he does.

18:46.158 --> 18:50.660
Right.

18:55.886 --> 18:57.531
is it hopeless?

18:57.628 --> 18:59.133
Justin or the car?

18:59.207 --> 19:01.553
Both. -There's a fix for the car.

19:01.635 --> 19:03.263
What about one of those rehab resorts?

19:03.335 --> 19:05.180
I thought we were taking him 
there.Isn't that the plan?

19:05.246 --> 19:08.923
Well,yeah,it was,until I found out the 
military insists on treating justin themselves.

19:08.955 --> 19:12.983
While angry insurgents fire at him.That's 
how he got into trouble in the first place.

19:13.038 --> 19:14.430
It doesn't make sense. 

19:14.496 --> 19:18.383
Oh,and when this war starts making 
sense,be sure to let me know 

19:18.455 --> 19:22.862
good as new.I even changed your 
spark plugs for you,free of charge.

19:25.648 --> 19:27.612
okay.

19:27.665 --> 19:30.212
$400,right?

19:30.257 --> 19:32.541
Oh,cash.We're--we're cash only here.

19:32.585 --> 19:34.333
Oh,god.

19:34.396 --> 19:37.080
Why didn't you tell us 
this four hours ago?

19:37.176 --> 19:39.170
Well,you  weren't 
paying four hours ago.

19:39.236 --> 19:41.743
Besides,the signs--the signs 
have been here the whole time.

19:41.776 --> 19:43.012
Do you have an A.T.M?

19:43.087 --> 19:46.723
Nearest one's in ruby valley,
but I wouldn't recommend walkin'.

19:46.777 --> 19:48.922
The car rental place 
down the road takes credit.

19:48.995 --> 19:51.192
Wait a second.You can use 
a credit card to rent a car,

19:51.318 --> 19:53.470
but not to get back 
the car that you own?

19:53.528 --> 19:55.661
They take credit.

19:59.158 --> 20:02.020
you know what you should-- shut up.

20:06.105 --> 20:11.093
hey,whit,I really don't want to do a piece 
on what thanksgiving means to republicans.

20:11.126 --> 20:13.262
That's not what I want to talk to you about.

20:15.097 --> 20:20.273
Amber has brought a matter of 
some concern to my attention.

20:20.325 --> 20:22.630
Okay.What's the concern?

20:22.688 --> 20:26.753
That you went easy on the senator 
in return for a personal favor.

20:30.827 --> 20:36.600
Okay,well,amber,can you tell me where 
and from whom you got that idea?

20:36.678 --> 20:37.863
Are you saying you did?

20:37.907 --> 20:43.173
No,I'm saying that it's not professional and it's not 
responsible to make accusations without any proof.

20:43.227 --> 20:45.240
But you didn't ask the 
senator about his divorce.

20:45.298 --> 20:48.311
When you conduct the interviews,amber,
you can decide what gets asked,but--

20:48.365 --> 20:53.121
I mean,do you have any knowledge 
of mccallister throwing me any favors?

20:53.125 --> 20:56.612
No,but I know that-- no.

20:56.688 --> 21:00.643
Then I'm a little confused as 
to what we're doing here then.

21:00.887 --> 21:03.562
Sorry,kitty.

21:14.186 --> 21:16.902
can I talk to you 
for a minute,please?

21:17.977 --> 21:18.973
Two hours?

21:18.985 --> 21:21.141
Two hours,and you have to go 
tattle to your little girlfriend?

21:21.158 --> 21:23.281
- What are you talking about?  
- Whit called me on the carpet.

21:23.295 --> 21:25.832
He's accusing me of bribing 
mccallister to help justin.

21:25.847 --> 21:27.233
Kitty,I didn't tell whit anything.

21:27.248 --> 21:28.993
You told amber.

21:29.595 --> 21:30.560
I told her what I thought.

21:30.576 --> 21:32.421
- I didn't think she'd say anything.  
- Oh,oh,really?

21:32.436 --> 21:33.612
Little miss blonde ambition?

21:33.858 --> 21:35.382
Besides,you denied it.

21:35.396 --> 21:37.513
You told me you didn't do anything.

21:37.596 --> 21:39.780
Are you telling me 
something different now?

21:43.018 --> 21:44.070
All right.

21:44.088 --> 21:46.493
When justin went away,I went away.

21:46.505 --> 21:49.082
I went back to New York,and I 
missed all the holidays without him.

21:49.097 --> 21:50.831
I missed all the meals without him.

21:50.847 --> 21:53.981
I missed all the fights that my mother and my 
father must have had when they were worried sick,

21:53.996 --> 21:56.590
and that was when we 
were winning the war.

21:56.738 --> 21:58.431
That was when the...

21:58.717 --> 22:01.142
when we knew what we were fighting for.

22:01.158 --> 22:03.252
But now it's more dangerous 
than ever over there,

22:03.265 --> 22:06.002
and he's going back,and 
I'm here,and my mother--

22:06.017 --> 22:09.983
my mother,who is so strong-- 
she is so heartbroken...

22:10.708 --> 22:12.270
so,yes.

22:12.777 --> 22:17.013
Yes,of course,I asked mccallister 
to help me,and he said no.

22:17.028 --> 22:23.183
So I thought that if I did him a favor and didn't 
ask him about the divorce that maybe he could help me.

22:23.267 --> 22:25.920
I thought maybe he 
would change his mind.

22:26.178 --> 22:28.773
And you know what? 
I don't care if it was wrong.

22:29.495 --> 22:31.360
I did it for my brother. 
I did it for my family.

22:31.375 --> 22:34.771
And you know what? I would 
do it again in a heartbeat.

22:42.045 --> 22:44.601
I'm just--I'M...

22:50.266 --> 22:51.983
- We got a problem.  
- What?

22:51.996 --> 22:53.793
No motels in this town.

22:53.805 --> 22:55.383
No motels,no hotels.

22:55.398 --> 22:57.971
The closest thing 
is 60 miles away.

22:57.985 --> 23:01.763
That island on "lost" has more 
civilition than this place.

23:04.677 --> 23:05.412
Where are you going?

23:05.427 --> 23:08.670
Well,if I'm gonna sleep in a rental 
car,I'm not gonna do it sober.

23:08.966 --> 23:10.000
No. Whoa,sarah!

23:10.018 --> 23:13.000
Now is not the time 
to get your buzz on.

23:21.005 --> 23:23.321
This is straight out 
of a few good men.

23:24.426 --> 23:26.641
More than a few. 
Three beers,please.

23:26.656 --> 23:28.180
I thought you wanted to get wasted.

23:28.196 --> 23:30.760
Three bourbons,too. Thanks.

23:35.648 --> 23:37.370
- To william's folly. 
- Oh,come on.

23:37.386 --> 23:39.431
Could you show some respect?

23:39.446 --> 23:43.123
I'm sorry,tommy,but parentage 
isn't a free pass to cheat and steal.

23:43.136 --> 23:46.053
Look,I know,but-- 
he was also our dad.

23:46.865 --> 23:48.500
To william.

23:48.736 --> 23:50.190
Cheers.

23:51.785 --> 23:53.041
Excuse me,ma'am.

23:53.086 --> 23:55.110
We don't get too 
many civilians in here.

23:55.127 --> 23:56.322
Are you lost?

23:56.338 --> 23:58.731
- I might be. 
- She's not.

23:58.745 --> 23:59.853
Sorry,man. You her boyfriend?

23:59.868 --> 24:01.693
No,her brother. 
Plus she's married.

24:01.705 --> 24:04.932
Uh,tommy,in case you haven't 
noticed,there's,like,

24:04.947 --> 24:06.671
the entire 82nd airborne in here.

24:06.685 --> 24:10.251
So--um,I'm sorry,he gets a little 
protective of her. Has done since puberty.

24:10.266 --> 24:13.093
I just wanted to see if the lady might 
be interested in shooting a little pool.

24:13.105 --> 24:15.190
Actually,the lady would.

24:15.208 --> 24:16.121
Don't worry,tommy.

24:16.136 --> 24:19.690
It's only a game of pool. 
My virtue will remain intact.

24:30.887 --> 24:31.762
don't worry about that,man.

24:31.778 --> 24:34.751
Dan's just happy to see a woman 
out of uniform,you know?

24:35.805 --> 24:39.273
Life on the base is pretty 
much a 24/7 sausage fest.

24:39.287 --> 24:41.040
That sounds pretty...

24:41.557 --> 24:44.363
horrible.That-- that 
sounds pretty horrible.

24:47.706 --> 24:49.401
- You're alive. 
- Are you?

24:49.416 --> 24:51.741
Oh,this. I-I had a run-in 
with some siding.

24:52.246 --> 24:53.860
The siding won.

24:54.375 --> 24:56.501
david,please come in.

24:57.106 --> 24:58.813
This is a surprise--

24:58.825 --> 25:01.631
a very nice one,but unexpected.

25:01.737 --> 25:03.583
Well,I'm sorry to just 
drop by like this,

25:03.598 --> 25:07.163
but things were left huh... 
a little unresolved.

25:07.178 --> 25:09.431
I know. I'm so sorry,david.

25:09.928 --> 25:13.690
I am so sorry. It was 
a lovely,lovely evening,

25:13.706 --> 25:18.232
but things happened with-- 
life happened,

25:18.246 --> 25:20.293
and I got distracted.

25:20.406 --> 25:22.313
Yeah,I get that.

25:22.657 --> 25:24.022
Life happens.

25:24.037 --> 25:26.173
Why don't you tell me what's going on?

25:27.595 --> 25:30.542
I've got five grown children 
and two grandchildren

25:30.558 --> 25:33.830
and a house full of problems 
I can't quit thinking about.

25:35.045 --> 25:37.342
Well,then maybe you're 
not supposed to.

25:39.025 --> 25:40.162
You're so sweet,david.

25:40.177 --> 25:44.022
I really think you should run screaming 
from me as if you were on fire.

25:44.037 --> 25:45.730
No,no,no. You're not gonna get off that easy.

25:45.747 --> 25:49.231
I don't ditch my friends just because 
they're going through a rough patch.

25:50.348 --> 25:51.430
"Friends"?

25:51.447 --> 25:52.703
That's what you want,isn't it?

25:52.715 --> 25:56.113
Yes. Yes,I truly do.

25:56.666 --> 25:58.162
Great.

25:58.657 --> 26:00.001
So we're okay now?

26:00.017 --> 26:02.811
Yes. Yes,we're great.

26:04.818 --> 26:05.962
David,please don't be a stranger.

26:05.975 --> 26:10.383
I don't want you to feel like every time you 
come here you're always required to nail something.

26:11.756 --> 26:13.452
I didn't say that right,did I?

26:13.465 --> 26:15.062
Sure you did.

26:17.118 --> 26:19.750
- I'll be around,nora.  
- I hope so.

26:31.487 --> 26:33.170
hey,you're back.

26:33.688 --> 26:35.910
So,uh,where'd you put the letter?

26:36.347 --> 26:37.523
What letter?

26:37.537 --> 26:38.973
The form letter.

26:38.987 --> 26:41.432
You know,the one you were trying 
to get kitty to get me to sign.

26:41.825 --> 26:44.060
Yeah,you're busted,
mom. She told me.

26:44.076 --> 26:45.483
I'm sorry,justin.

26:45.496 --> 26:48.301
Look,it's cool. I just 
want to see it,that's all.

26:48.726 --> 26:50.753
Been doing some rethinking.

26:50.766 --> 26:53.661
That's great. I threw it out.

26:53.675 --> 26:57.243
Kitty told me you wouldn't be 
interested,so I went and threw it out.

27:07.225 --> 27:09.532
You sent it in already.

27:13.977 --> 27:16.501
I knew you would eventually 
change your mind.

27:20.245 --> 27:21.773
What are you doing?

27:21.785 --> 27:24.590
I'm gonna call the recruiter 
and tell him to ignore that letter.

27:24.607 --> 27:27.043
- Justin...   
- god,I shoulda done this a long time ago.

27:27.055 --> 27:28.510
I mean,kitty knew. She 
knew that was the only way

27:28.526 --> 27:30.822
she was gonna have a life was to 
get as far away from you as possible.

27:30.837 --> 27:34.602
I want you to have a life. 
That's the whole point. Please.

27:34.615 --> 27:37.702
I don't want you to do something 
I know you will regret!

27:37.716 --> 27:39.242
That's right. You know,right?

27:39.256 --> 27:41.822
You know what I should do 
and how I should do it,mom.

27:42.237 --> 27:45.232
Because you're my whole life.

27:46.247 --> 27:49.772
No,mom,I'm your son. 
I've got my own life.

28:00.418 --> 28:02.053
Where'd you learn 
to break like that?

28:02.067 --> 28:04.212
Three brothers and a dad.

28:04.227 --> 28:06.381
Uh,are you done having...

28:06.567 --> 28:08.280
Fun yet?

28:09.898 --> 28:11.512
I love this song.

28:20.117 --> 28:23.062
- Dance,tommy. 
- Couldn't you just kill me instead?

28:33.276 --> 28:34.721
your sister has 
how many kids?

28:34.738 --> 28:37.122
I honestly don't 
know anymore.

28:37.718 --> 28:38.490
How about you?

28:38.508 --> 28:39.862
No,I-I don't 
have any kids.

28:39.877 --> 28:42.613
And I don't envision that 
happening anytime soon

28:42.626 --> 28:44.573
'cause for one thing,I'm gay.

28:44.585 --> 28:48.293
So an unplanned pregnancy 
isn't really a risk for me.

28:48.307 --> 28:51.093
For another,you kinda need to 
be in a long-term relationship,

28:51.108 --> 28:54.993
and my--my boyfriend 
just broke up with me so...

28:55.005 --> 28:57.013
so you're single.

28:58.237 --> 29:00.193
I was hoping you'd say that.

29:05.405 --> 29:07.892
good news. No,great news.

29:07.906 --> 29:10.640
I've got a line on a place 
for us to crash tonight.

29:12.515 --> 29:14.101
You're incredible.

29:14.117 --> 29:17.111
We come to an army bar,
and he gets laid.

29:17.127 --> 29:20.283
Well,not yet,but I 
am working on it.

29:24.035 --> 29:26.982
You're either about to do 
something very naughty,

29:26.997 --> 29:29.132
or you already have.

29:29.807 --> 29:31.111
What gave me away?

29:31.126 --> 29:35.940
The night before you cheated on mrs.
Worthington's spelling test,you ate a whole pinte.

29:39.008 --> 29:42.683
You remember every bad thing 
I've ever done,don't you?

29:43.126 --> 29:46.302
I remember every bad thing
we've both ever done.

29:48.927 --> 29:51.993
Well,I've got a new one,
one for the record books.

29:57.118 --> 30:00.683
I tried to bribe the 
senator to help justin.

30:01.157 --> 30:02.733
To get him out of the military?

30:02.745 --> 30:08.062
Yeah,I thought that he'd be able to 
help justin and get him off the hook.

30:08.758 --> 30:10.973
And me,too,I guess.

30:12.798 --> 30:15.412
It wasn't your fault 
that justin enlisted.

30:15.425 --> 30:17.391
It was mine.

30:17.486 --> 30:19.841
- What are you talking about?  
- I pushed him.

30:20.435 --> 30:24.512
He was about to change his mind,
and I pushed him the other way.

30:24.795 --> 30:27.102
And I blamed it on you.

30:27.518 --> 30:31.060
I was too angry and scared 
to blame it on myself.

30:31.907 --> 30:33.801
no. Justin would have never 
enlisted if I hadn't--

30:33.818 --> 30:36.050
you're both crazy.

30:36.338 --> 30:39.082
I enlisted because 
I wanted to.

30:40.666 --> 30:44.051
I went back and forth about a thousand 
times in my head before I went,

30:44.067 --> 30:48.330
and nothing anyone said or 
did was gonna change my mind.

30:48.348 --> 30:51.151
It was the best and worst decision 
I've made in my entire life,

30:51.165 --> 30:53.810
but you know what? 
It was my choice.

30:55.085 --> 30:57.602
So I'm not going 
to fight the recall.

30:58.196 --> 31:00.020
I'm going back.

31:15.805 --> 31:18.022
I feel like nick 
nolte's mug shot.

31:18.318 --> 31:21.600
That's what happens when you 
do jell-o shots with enlisted men.

31:21.816 --> 31:23.622
If we're not as 
chipper as you are,kev,

31:23.637 --> 31:25.300
it's because you didn't 
sleep on the floor.

31:25.318 --> 31:26.870
Oh,that's right,tommy.

31:26.885 --> 31:28.740
I certainly did not.

31:31.248 --> 31:34.242
one day,son,this will all be yours.

31:36.987 --> 31:41.293
Okay,tommy,500 miles,two 
cars later,you happy now?

31:41.518 --> 31:42.673
Yeah,come on,tommy,let's go.

31:42.688 --> 31:45.273
We've got a long trip ahead of us.

31:45.368 --> 31:48.390
I don't get it. How could 
he be this stupid?

31:48.408 --> 31:50.433
- No,how could you be? 
- Oh,screw you.

31:50.448 --> 31:53.680
- okay,let's calm down. 
- I'm sick of her cracks about him.

31:53.695 --> 31:56.012
I don't care about the 
mistakes that he made.

31:56.027 --> 31:57.291
- I don't care. 
- Fine.

31:57.307 --> 31:58.520
All right? 
He was our dad.

31:58.538 --> 31:59.913
Not just ours.

31:59.926 --> 32:01.933
Excuse me?

32:01.956 --> 32:04.081
What--at e-exactly 
does that mean?

32:04.097 --> 32:06.850
You just said,"not just ours"? 
What...

32:07.866 --> 32:09.880
he had another kid...

32:12.945 --> 32:14.960
with holly.

32:17.575 --> 32:20.212
Remember that photo we 
found up at the ranch?

32:20.228 --> 32:21.780
That was her.

32:22.096 --> 32:23.953
Her name's rebecca.

32:23.965 --> 32:25.982
Dad kept her photo.

32:26.635 --> 32:28.260
of course.

32:28.275 --> 32:30.011
And,um...

32:30.047 --> 32:33.321
So does,uh,does--does 
mom know about this?

32:33.338 --> 32:36.231
No! And,kevin,
she never will,ok?

32:36.246 --> 32:37.411
Oh,and-- and have 
you met her?

32:37.425 --> 32:39.652
- I mean are we gonna meet her?  
- No and no.

32:39.665 --> 32:41.211
Well,we are talking 
about another sister.

32:41.225 --> 32:44.633
No,actually,we're not talking 
about her anymore ever again.

32:44.646 --> 32:46.303
Okay? Can we please just go home?

32:46.318 --> 32:49.622
- I don't think we should leave until we
- kev,kev,kev,

32:49.858 --> 32:51.720
just let it go,okay?

32:51.735 --> 32:53.281
There's a bank in town.

32:53.298 --> 32:55.183
We can get cash there.

32:57.318 --> 33:00.291
Yeah,sure.Yeah.Let's--yeah,
let's let it go. Of course.

33:07.245 --> 33:09.250
Uh,hey,jack,if it's okay with you,

33:09.266 --> 33:12.240
I'd like to introduce 
the mccallister segment.

33:12.255 --> 33:13.543
Yeah,sure. It's your interview.

33:13.557 --> 33:15.193
- and we're on in three...  
- thanks.

33:15.205 --> 33:16.453
Two...

33:16.537 --> 33:20.070
welcome. Obama mulls an '08 run,
election day fallout,

33:20.087 --> 33:23.212
and we go toe-to-toe on 
gay marriage,but first,

33:23.225 --> 33:26.410
an exclusive interview with 
senator robert mccallister,

33:26.428 --> 33:29.123
who sat down yesterday 
with our own kitty walker.

33:29.298 --> 33:31.373
- Kitty. 
- Thank you,jack.

33:32.267 --> 33:34.172
In the interview that 
you are about to see,

33:34.188 --> 33:36.990
I asked senator mccallister 
about his stem cell bill,

33:37.005 --> 33:42.293
his position on iraq and his aspiration 
towards higher executive office.

33:42.888 --> 33:47.291
What I didn't ask him about 
was his recent divorce.

33:47.935 --> 33:50.393
Now I wish I could I say I didn't 
ask the senator about his divorce

33:50.408 --> 33:54.320
because of some high-minded notion 
of journalistic integrity,but...

33:55.445 --> 33:58.612
it was just the opposite.

33:59.205 --> 34:05.491
I have a brother who served in afghanistan 
and was recently called back to serve in iraq.

34:07.535 --> 34:10.330
And I did the senator a favor 
in the hope that he would do me one

34:10.344 --> 34:13.230
and use his influence to 
keep my brother home...

34:14.545 --> 34:20.232
to keep him from fighting in a war 
that I have defended on this very program.

34:20.416 --> 34:22.449
Senator mccallister rightly 
refused to help me.

34:22.465 --> 34:24.041
His integrity remains intact.

34:24.058 --> 34:28.010
But mine,however,less so.

34:28.868 --> 34:30.782
Mistakes were made.

34:30.987 --> 34:33.699
President ronald reagan said 
those words 20 years ago at a time

34:33.715 --> 34:37.203
when admitting a mistake was 
perceived as a sign of strength,

34:37.215 --> 34:39.081
not weakness.

34:41.784 --> 34:44.003
I made a mistake.

34:44.636 --> 34:48.482
I made a mistake in compromising 
the interview that you're about to see,

34:48.995 --> 34:54.880
and I made a mistake in continuing to defend a 
war that is in a desperate need of reexamination,

34:55.257 --> 35:02.620
reexamination which cannot come until we 
acknowledge that the war itself was a mistake.

35:03.048 --> 35:06.522
None of this is meant to serve 
as an excuse for my own conduct,

35:06.535 --> 35:12.263
but I do hope that you will find 
it in your hearts to accept my apology.

35:14.748 --> 35:15.531
Thank you,kitty.

35:15.546 --> 35:19.970
And now our interview with 
senator robert mccallister.

35:20.496 --> 35:22.601
and back in 15.

35:23.758 --> 35:25.342
kitty.

35:30.478 --> 35:32.670
You were right to say something.

35:34.165 --> 35:36.083
do you realize with gas,
food and the car,

35:36.098 --> 35:38.421
this trip actually cost us money?

35:38.827 --> 35:40.951
It's just,I never remember 
dad coming out here.

35:40.965 --> 35:43.173
Well,he must have at some point.

35:43.286 --> 35:44.631
What?

35:44.778 --> 35:46.952
- This is the only bank.  
- Yeah.

35:46.967 --> 35:49.480
Maybe this is where 
dad got the mortgage.

35:50.275 --> 35:51.463
Excuse me.

35:51.477 --> 35:53.611
Hey,uh,my father 
passed away recently,

35:53.628 --> 35:56.610
and I think he might have had a 
loan through your bank. William walker.

35:56.627 --> 35:58.453
Oh,uh,let me check the records.

35:58.467 --> 36:00.552
Look,dad bought that 
land for a reason.

36:00.566 --> 36:02.211
I mean,he must have had a reason.

36:02.517 --> 36:03.903
Maybe the reason's 
in the loan docs.

36:03.918 --> 36:05.560
I agree.

36:06.106 --> 36:09.211
I'm sorry. There's no 
loans to a william walker.

36:09.715 --> 36:13.151
But,uh,he did maintain a 
safe deposit box with us.

36:15.437 --> 36:18.332
Uh,I'm--I'm the executor 
of mr. Walker's estate,

36:18.346 --> 36:20.442
and I'd like to see 
that box,please.

36:20.458 --> 36:23.512
Well,I'll need a death 
certificate and a copy of the will.

36:23.528 --> 36:25.222
Of course. What's 
your fax number?

36:29.468 --> 36:31.173
No,they're just papers.

36:34.376 --> 36:36.351
It's a letter for mom.

36:38.008 --> 36:39.261
What's that?

36:39.276 --> 36:40.423
Oh,it's an easement.

36:40.438 --> 36:43.523
It's,uh,it's kind of a free 
pass to use someone else's land.

36:43.535 --> 36:46.681
Look,dad gave permission to the 
army to drive over the land he bought.

36:50.546 --> 36:51.631
oh,my god.

36:51.648 --> 36:54.073
Don't tell me. 
Dad used to be a woman.

36:54.105 --> 36:56.822
No,no. There's a 
survivorship clause.

36:57.778 --> 37:00.873
upon dad's death,we can 
sell the land to the army.

37:01.045 --> 37:03.023
The sale price...

37:03.036 --> 37:05.792
of the land is,uh,
is--is--is liquidated.

37:05.808 --> 37:07.470
It's a set amount.

37:07.488 --> 37:10.880
It is it enough to pay 
back the money dad stole?

37:12.045 --> 37:14.950
Yeah,and--and-- and then some.

37:17.185 --> 37:19.851
William's folly is worth...

37:20.276 --> 37:23.281
over $30 million.

37:26.468 --> 37:28.362
- No. 
- Yeah.

37:28.376 --> 37:30.052
- Really? 
- Yeah.

37:45.158 --> 37:46.281
It's your brother.

37:47.696 --> 37:49.070
I'm hungry.

37:50.025 --> 37:53.411
Uh,please warn me in advance which entrees 
were prepared with kitty's loving hands.

37:53.426 --> 37:56.442
Uh,you guys know that I'm 
standing right here,right?

37:56.598 --> 37:58.311
- good morning. 
- morning.

37:58.488 --> 37:59.573
Wait,you're cooking?

37:59.587 --> 38:01.553
Under the proper supervision.

38:02.726 --> 38:04.821
I can see your appetite's returned.

38:04.836 --> 38:05.830
kitty,phone call.

38:05.845 --> 38:07.950
Uh,take a message,please.

38:07.965 --> 38:10.132
Sure. What should I tell the senator?

38:20.657 --> 38:21.650
hello.

38:21.916 --> 38:25.750
Happy thanksgiving,
and good interview.

38:25.765 --> 38:27.401
I thought it came off 
particularly well.

38:27.415 --> 38:31.603
Oh,well,that's probably because 
I didn't ask if you slept with the nanny.

38:31.617 --> 38:35.400
If that's regret that I'm sensing,
then for the record,no,I didn'T.

38:35.776 --> 38:37.960
So how fast did they fire you?

38:37.975 --> 38:39.982
Well,they haven't fired me yet.

38:39.997 --> 38:41.201
Really? That's too bad.

38:41.217 --> 38:43.170
I was hoping you'd be back on the market.

38:43.187 --> 38:44.343
Excuse me?

38:44.355 --> 38:47.653
I could use somebody like 
you on my communications staff.

38:47.668 --> 38:51.412
Y-you're offering me 
a job on your staff?

38:51.427 --> 38:53.221
No,as my nanny.

38:54.486 --> 38:56.230
You don't have to 
say yes right away.

38:56.248 --> 38:58.121
Just tell me you'll 
think about it.

39:01.605 --> 39:03.480
Yeah,I'll think about it.

39:03.716 --> 39:05.643
Happy thanksgiving,senator.

39:05.656 --> 39:07.363
You,too.

39:11.568 --> 39:12.710
That's incredible news.

39:12.727 --> 39:14.493
Yeah,it is incredible.

39:14.507 --> 39:16.151
So we're gonna be all right,then?

39:16.166 --> 39:17.721
You could put it that way.

39:17.737 --> 39:20.931
We're not going into bankruptcy,
nora. That's the main thing.

39:21.566 --> 39:23.002
We were looking through dad's stuff,

39:23.016 --> 39:26.271
and we found this,addressed to you.

39:26.996 --> 39:28.741
We didn't open it.

39:30.857 --> 39:32.541
That's dad's handwriting.

39:35.046 --> 39:36.970
I know he wasn't perfect,but...

39:37.358 --> 39:42.132
still,he was a lot more than what 
we've been giving him credit for lately.

39:42.646 --> 39:45.421
Yeah,he was.

40:02.637 --> 40:04.672
"my dearest nora,

40:04.687 --> 40:07.640
there's a part of me that 
hopes you never read this.

40:07.655 --> 40:12.482
Because if you are,it means that you've discovered 
some of the mistakes I've made in my life.

40:12.495 --> 40:14.732
And while I've tried to 
set those mistakes right,

40:14.747 --> 40:19.182
I know that I'll never be able 
to completely repair your trust.

40:19.237 --> 40:23.082
It tortures me to think that 
I've ever caused you a moment's pain.

40:23.095 --> 40:25.162
"But I know I have.

40:26.305 --> 40:29.292
I only hope that you can 
find it in your heart... 

40:29.308 --> 40:33.983
a heart which is far better and purer 
than mine-- "to forgive me my sins.

40:35.637 --> 40:38.753
Because despite my mistakes 
and errors in judgment,

40:38.766 --> 40:41.321
I have always loved you.

40:42.225 --> 40:45.982
I have always treasured your 
love and the love of our children.

40:45.996 --> 40:48.823
Each of one of them is 
a little piece of you.

40:48.836 --> 40:52.310
Each one is so lucky to 
have gotten your kind heart.

40:52.755 --> 40:57.830
And no matter what mistakes I've made or to the 
extent of the pain those mistakes may have caused,

40:57.848 --> 41:01.483
I know I've done at least one 
right thing in this life...

41:01.966 --> 41:05.782
and that was to fall in love 
and make a family with you."

41:09.108 --> 41:10.402
thank you.

41:14.977 --> 41:16.313
Thank you.

41:18.857 --> 41:21.401
Thank you all so much for being here.

41:21.416 --> 41:23.323
It means so much to me...

41:24.256 --> 41:26.392
especially after these past few months.

41:26.405 --> 41:28.730
We have all been 
through so much.

41:28.746 --> 41:33.183
And I'm--I'm so 
grateful to all of you.

41:34.226 --> 41:36.480
Cheers.

41:37.486 --> 41:39.103
Happy thanksgiving,everyone!

41:39.117 --> 41:41.823
happy thanksgiving!

41:42.767 --> 41:44.202
Cheers.

41:44.245 --> 41:45.690
Go ahead.

41:46.605 --> 41:47.661
It's the right time.

41:47.675 --> 41:50.070
Wait,wait,"right time" for what?

41:53.266 --> 41:54.791
we're having a baby.

41:57.058 --> 42:02.542
"because our family means so much 
more to me "than my mistakes suggest.

42:02.577 --> 42:08.083
our family is everything, the best 
thing I ever did in my entire life.

42:08.675 --> 42:12.031
With love and remorse, William."
