WEBVTT

00:56.000 --> 01:00.708
People I don't even know
ask me all sorts of questions.

01:00.875 --> 01:02.916
About my aunt.

01:05.791 --> 01:08.666
And my mum.

01:10.083 --> 01:15.791
They say we have plenty of time. That
we'll figure out what went wrong together.

01:18.333 --> 01:23.041
But for some people things go wrong
before they even begin.

01:45.041 --> 01:48.500
Can you hear me?
Hanne? Hanne?

01:48.666 --> 01:50.208
There's cardiac arrest.

01:56.625 --> 01:59.666
What happened?

02:01.875 --> 02:04.583
Had she been drinking?

02:07.333 --> 02:11.666
You know it's not your fault.

02:15.000 --> 02:18.583
I actually really liked your mother.

02:18.750 --> 02:23.458
- But in order to help an addict...
- I know.

02:26.708 --> 02:30.083
I spoke to your aunt.

02:31.083 --> 02:34.375
You can stay with them.

02:35.416 --> 02:41.791
- Can't I live on my own?
- You shouldn't be on your own right now.

02:44.375 --> 02:49.250
What?
Is there something I should know?

02:50.875 --> 02:56.583
- I don't know them.
- You'll get to know them.

02:58.958 --> 03:03.041
Your aunt and her family
really want to help you.

03:03.208 --> 03:06.583
I think you should let them.

04:02.375 --> 04:06.375
- Do you recognise it?
- No.

04:06.541 --> 04:10.708
You were very little
last time you were here.

04:16.166 --> 04:20.125
Let's see who's hiding in the basement.

04:38.583 --> 04:43.208
- Hi, Mum.
- Hi.

04:43.375 --> 04:47.375
- How did it go today?
- Fine.

04:47.541 --> 04:50.791
- What's that?
- I broke a window.

04:50.958 --> 04:53.083
Poor thing.

04:55.833 --> 04:59.041
I'm sorry about your mum.

05:00.500 --> 05:03.125
Thank you.

05:03.291 --> 05:06.416
You're too baked, sweetheart.

05:20.500 --> 05:24.416
- So only you and Mads live here?
- And David.

05:24.583 --> 05:28.833
- Do you remember him?
- Yes.

05:32.041 --> 05:37.375
He thinks he can come and go
as he pleases, but he's a good boy.

05:37.541 --> 05:40.875
Well, I'm his mother,
so I have to say that.

05:49.458 --> 05:54.250
Let me know if you need anything.

05:56.833 --> 06:00.083
I'm glad you're here, Ida.

07:57.708 --> 08:02.166
- Who do we have here? Good morning.
- Good morning.

08:02.333 --> 08:05.041
Sit down.

08:06.041 --> 08:08.250
Do you want this?

08:08.416 --> 08:12.000
- Do you drink coffee?
- Yes, please.

08:12.166 --> 08:17.541
- Did you sleep?
- No...

08:17.708 --> 08:20.791
- Can I have some?
- Sure.

08:23.166 --> 08:27.666
I can't even imagine
how you must feel.

08:29.416 --> 08:32.625
I remember your mum well.

08:32.791 --> 08:36.207
She used to play with us
in between clients.

08:36.375 --> 08:38.457
She was funny.

08:41.207 --> 08:46.000
- Will you be ready in five?
- Yes.

08:49.458 --> 08:52.208
But she had a bad temper, your mum.

08:52.375 --> 08:56.458
- She once threw a shoe at my head.
- Do you want to sit with Ida?

08:56.625 --> 09:00.166
You must have done something.

09:00.333 --> 09:04.666
Perhaps David and I had been spying
on the girls and their clients.

09:04.833 --> 09:07.791
- I was 12.
- Why wasn't I there?

09:07.958 --> 09:11.000
- Because you're a little shit.
- Do you have the accounts for me, Marie?

09:11.166 --> 09:14.041
Yes, I left them in the hallway.

09:16.875 --> 09:20.166
Ida, I think you should
come with me today.

09:20.333 --> 09:22.750
Fine.

09:22.916 --> 09:26.958
I'll take her.
Yes, you love that plate, don't you?

09:27.125 --> 09:31.041
But it's Ida's. Come to mummy.
Please take the plate, Ida.

09:31.208 --> 09:34.666
- Can you eat on the way?
- Yeah.

09:34.833 --> 09:37.166
Come on.

09:38.125 --> 09:40.916
Come on!

09:47.291 --> 09:49.916
Hey!

09:51.375 --> 09:54.125
This is my niece. Ida.
She's moved in with us.

09:54.291 --> 09:55.750
Alright.

09:55.916 --> 10:00.000
Will you show her around?
And she's only 17.

10:00.166 --> 10:02.750
Understood.

10:03.791 --> 10:07.916
Hello. Come with me.

10:18.458 --> 10:20.541
Hi.

10:28.333 --> 10:31.208
Call Jonas
and tell him you spoke to me.

10:31.375 --> 10:33.958
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

10:40.500 --> 10:43.500
Isn't it a great place?

10:48.125 --> 10:53.125
- Who was she?
- Someone who needs to borrow money.

10:54.375 --> 10:58.000
So we have to see if we can help her.

11:09.375 --> 11:14.125
Does the council pay you
for housing me?

11:14.291 --> 11:19.291
No, we don't get paid, Ida.

11:19.458 --> 11:25.333
We get a little child support
as long as you're 17, but it's nothing.

11:38.791 --> 11:42.583
Lars, I'm leaving.
It looks fine. Let's go.

11:42.750 --> 11:45.791
I'm sorry.

11:47.500 --> 11:49.916
Let's go out
and spend that child support.

11:50.083 --> 11:53.250
So you know
I'm not saving it for a rainy day.

11:53.416 --> 11:56.291
It's fine.

11:57.291 --> 11:59.041
I think we should.

11:59.208 --> 12:03.833
Have you finished this?
Then let's get the hell out of here.

12:15.500 --> 12:20.666
- Someone's having a party.
- It sounds like it.

12:23.083 --> 12:26.000
Should we take a look?

12:45.083 --> 12:49.375
- Hey, Mum.
- Who do we have here?

12:49.541 --> 12:54.125
- It's just me.
- Just you. Hi, David.

12:54.291 --> 13:00.250
- So you found your way home?
- Yes. I missed you.

13:02.666 --> 13:06.500
My sister dies,
and you don't answer your phone.

13:06.666 --> 13:11.416
I didn't know Hanne.
You didn't speak to her.

13:14.000 --> 13:18.458
I needed you.
And you weren't there.

13:24.916 --> 13:27.583
David.

13:30.041 --> 13:32.250
So this is David.

13:34.666 --> 13:37.833
- And that's Ida.
- Hi, Ida.

14:25.458 --> 14:28.083
Hi.

14:28.250 --> 14:31.041
I'm sorry.

14:32.833 --> 14:37.291
- You fucking scared me.
- I'm sorry.

14:49.083 --> 14:53.666
Are you David's girlfriend?

14:53.833 --> 14:59.458
I don't know if he would call me that.
At least not to my face.

15:08.958 --> 15:12.666
- Are you alright?
- Yeah, I just got a fright.

15:15.000 --> 15:17.833
I meant about your mum.

15:24.541 --> 15:27.333
I don't know...

15:31.333 --> 15:35.083
Life is so fucking random sometimes.

15:39.041 --> 15:42.458
That's why I got this. Look!

15:43.458 --> 15:45.750
Carpe Diem.

15:47.250 --> 15:50.333
It's Latin for YOLO.

15:53.583 --> 15:56.583
It's awesome, right?

16:05.125 --> 16:08.583
- Good morning!
- Good morning.

16:09.666 --> 16:12.375
Hi, Mum!

16:12.541 --> 16:16.041
- Hello, old boy.
- Ida's coming with you today.

16:16.208 --> 16:18.916
Great. Has David eaten?

16:19.083 --> 16:23.083
I don't know. I'm not going
down there as long as she's here.

16:23.250 --> 16:25.666
- Don't you like her?
- She hates me.

16:25.833 --> 16:28.208
David!

16:28.375 --> 16:31.416
So that's what I should have done.

16:34.625 --> 16:38.625
- Come on!
- Relax. You only just got here.

16:38.791 --> 16:40.875
Is Anna having breakfast?

16:41.041 --> 16:45.083
She left.
She knows she's not welcome.

16:45.250 --> 16:48.166
She's not good for you, David.

16:48.333 --> 16:53.458
- Your boyfriends have all been great...
- David!

16:55.083 --> 16:57.625
What do you want?

17:05.833 --> 17:10.625
I'm not an idiot.
You need to take care of yourself.

17:10.790 --> 17:16.750
And eat breakfast with your family
like a civilised human being. Okay?

17:57.375 --> 17:59.500
Why is she coming?

18:09.416 --> 18:12.291
Don't mind him, Ida.

18:12.458 --> 18:17.500
Whenever he's been away,
he tends to forget the rules.

18:17.666 --> 18:23.875
We're polite to one another.
And we're glad you're here, Ida.

18:35.291 --> 18:39.750
Do you need a slap?
Do you?

18:41.166 --> 18:43.833
Do you want another one?

18:44.000 --> 18:47.375
Are you ready?
Are you?

18:51.416 --> 18:54.291
I've missed you, man.

19:00.500 --> 19:03.166
There we go!

19:37.083 --> 19:42.625
- Are you not going in?
- No, the boss doesn't go in.

20:25.500 --> 20:27.958
We're not leaving
until you can do it.

20:30.666 --> 20:33.875
You're such an amateur.

22:17.250 --> 22:19.708
I need to go as well.

22:33.125 --> 22:35.958
What's up, Ida?

22:40.250 --> 22:45.125
- Come on. I'm cold!
- Shut up!

22:56.708 --> 22:59.291
Bye!

23:01.375 --> 23:03.666
Come on!

23:09.791 --> 23:12.500
What the fuck are you doing?

23:12.666 --> 23:16.916
You're throwing a rock at my car!
Are you stupid?

23:17.083 --> 23:20.541
- Where did it hit?
- You stupid idiot!

23:57.500 --> 24:03.041
- Are you up for a quick game?
- No, you're coming with me.

24:04.208 --> 24:07.333
Sleep tight, Ida.

24:09.000 --> 24:14.416
Do you want to play?
I'll grab some beers.

24:23.958 --> 24:28.875
- You're good!
- I told you.

24:38.083 --> 24:42.791
- Come on!
- You come on.

24:51.500 --> 24:53.791
Can I see your breasts?

24:57.333 --> 24:59.333
No.

24:59.500 --> 25:02.750
I'll show you my dick.

25:20.125 --> 25:23.541
Don't tell my mum I asked.

25:44.458 --> 25:49.208
No, don't do that.
That won't help you.

25:52.125 --> 25:57.000
I can't tell you right now.
Call me in a few days.

25:58.208 --> 26:02.333
Yes. That's how it is. Bye.

26:03.666 --> 26:08.666
- Something wrong?
- No, people are just impatient.

26:08.833 --> 26:13.916
- Did you have fun yesterday?
- Yes, I did.

26:15.625 --> 26:19.208
That's why it's so quiet around here.

26:20.375 --> 26:23.708
We got back late.

26:28.166 --> 26:31.875
Should we try to revive them?

26:46.416 --> 26:49.458
- See you!
- Bye!

27:17.041 --> 27:19.625
Hi, Sofia.

27:22.291 --> 27:27.250
Do you remember me?
I'm a friend of your dad's.

27:27.416 --> 27:30.541
Do you want a ride?

27:32.291 --> 27:36.458
It's quicker than the bus.
Come on.

27:47.375 --> 27:50.583
- Hi.
- Hi.

28:08.500 --> 28:12.291
Did you have a good day at school?

28:12.458 --> 28:16.750
- You're in the fourth grade, right?
- Yes.

28:18.000 --> 28:20.625
Do you like school?

28:24.250 --> 28:27.041
I didn't like school.

28:28.375 --> 28:30.666
Me neither.

28:31.791 --> 28:34.041
I like history.

28:34.208 --> 28:36.666
What do you like about it?

28:36.833 --> 28:40.708
- I don't know.
- Sure you do.

28:42.416 --> 28:45.583
I like imagining all those people.

28:47.416 --> 28:50.083
I see.

28:55.333 --> 29:00.416
But there are all those numbers
and dates you have to remember.

29:00.583 --> 29:03.875
I could never do it.

29:27.750 --> 29:30.750
Here we are.

29:32.291 --> 29:35.041
That's your house, right?

29:37.041 --> 29:41.541
Will you give your dad
this from me?

29:42.708 --> 29:45.750
And tell him we drove you home.

29:45.916 --> 29:49.791
So he knows
you didn't go with strangers.

29:52.250 --> 29:55.125
- Bye.
- Bye.

30:31.125 --> 30:35.458
What if he doesn't have the money?

30:35.625 --> 30:38.750
Once I speak to the children,
they usually do.

31:47.375 --> 31:51.250
It's really cute!

31:51.416 --> 31:56.208
It's so nice to finally have a baby girl
to buy presents for.

31:56.375 --> 31:59.416
- This is from Nana.
- It's beautiful.

31:59.583 --> 32:03.166
Look.
It will look lovely on her.

32:03.333 --> 32:06.125
Are you losing interest?

32:06.291 --> 32:08.708
That's Anna.

32:10.833 --> 32:14.125
- Now what?
- Sorry?

32:15.125 --> 32:18.083
The two of you just need
to get to know each other.

32:18.250 --> 32:22.583
- Just like with Marie.
- Marie was never impolite.

32:23.583 --> 32:28.083
- You hated her for years.
- No!

32:31.208 --> 32:34.333
Why are you saying that?
It's not true.

32:34.500 --> 32:40.291
At least Anna's trying.
That's more than I can say about you.

32:44.166 --> 32:47.666
- Hi, honey.
- Hi, baby.

32:47.833 --> 32:50.750
- Hi!
- Hi.

32:50.916 --> 32:54.666
- I'm glad you could make it.
- Thanks for inviting me.

32:54.833 --> 32:57.875
- I brought a present from David and me.
- Thanks.

32:59.208 --> 33:03.916
- Do you want to hold her?
- Yes, please! Hello.

33:04.083 --> 33:09.208
Hello, baby girl.
You're six months old today.

33:12.833 --> 33:16.375
You're so cute.

33:16.541 --> 33:19.500
- Wow!
- What is it?

33:19.666 --> 33:24.375
- It's meant to make them really clever.
- We should get you one too, Mads.

33:24.541 --> 33:26.750
Shut up!

33:27.958 --> 33:32.833
Look at this. Look what you got.

33:33.000 --> 33:35.000
So you can become clever.

33:37.458 --> 33:40.541
- Isn't it fun?
- Did giving birth hurt, Marie?

33:40.708 --> 33:45.041
- What?
- What do you think?

33:47.958 --> 33:50.583
Yes, it's pretty painful.

33:55.000 --> 33:59.375
It's painful,
but you get over it.

33:59.541 --> 34:02.875
Do you?

34:05.625 --> 34:10.166
- Take some cake, whatever you like.
- Thanks.

34:11.500 --> 34:16.208
- We need to collect the money faster.
- I know what I'm doing.

34:16.375 --> 34:21.250
- Then why am I getting phone calls?
- Do we have to talk about that now?

34:21.416 --> 34:24.250
Yes, when we're all in the same room.

34:25.750 --> 34:30.041
- Ida, please go into the other room.
- It concerns her too.

34:36.500 --> 34:38.791
Maybe we're not tough enough.

34:38.958 --> 34:42.541
That's easy for you to say.
You're not there.

34:42.708 --> 34:46.875
I can ask Chase if they want me,
but I doubt they'll want my old tits.

34:47.041 --> 34:49.625
That's not what I meant!

34:52.250 --> 34:55.458
So what do you suggest?

35:01.583 --> 35:04.666
I'm going to check on Anna.

35:10.416 --> 35:13.208
Is he using again?

35:15.375 --> 35:20.333
- I don't know.
- You don't know?

35:22.458 --> 35:26.250
Why aren't you
looking out for your brother?

35:29.041 --> 35:32.708
I taught you to always look out
for each other.

36:25.250 --> 36:27.875
So you took my cigarettes?

36:30.750 --> 36:33.083
I'm sorry.

36:34.375 --> 36:37.958
I'm actually trying to cut down.

36:40.833 --> 36:43.833
- Can I tell you something?
- Of course.

36:47.083 --> 36:49.791
Fuck it, pass me one of those.

37:06.416 --> 37:09.541
OK. Guess.

37:13.000 --> 37:15.458
I don't know.

37:19.625 --> 37:22.583
What is it?

37:22.750 --> 37:25.416
I'm pregnant.

37:28.041 --> 37:31.333
That's why I came along today.

37:32.416 --> 37:35.625
Aren't you happy for me?

37:35.791 --> 37:39.000
Yes, of course.

37:40.291 --> 37:43.083
We just need to get our own place.

37:43.250 --> 37:46.833
I don't want him living here
when we have the baby.

37:47.000 --> 37:50.208
I do not want to end up like Marie.

37:52.875 --> 37:56.833
Why do you think
your mum stayed clear of them?

37:57.000 --> 37:59.958
They're insane.

38:06.833 --> 38:11.958
- I'm going back inside.
- We're talking.

38:15.208 --> 38:21.041
- You didn't know my mum.
- No, but I know she loved you.

38:30.000 --> 38:32.000
Hey...

39:31.875 --> 39:35.750
- Stop it.
- No, I won't. Are you ready?

39:35.916 --> 39:38.166
Yeah.

39:38.333 --> 39:40.583
Good.

41:28.208 --> 41:31.458
Hey. Easy now...

41:34.125 --> 41:39.458
Just let her pass, and we'll go.

41:39.625 --> 41:41.458
Easy...

41:43.375 --> 41:45.458
Dad?

41:46.500 --> 41:48.500
How do I know
you won't come back?

41:48.666 --> 41:51.208
Calm down.
It's a misunderstanding.

41:51.375 --> 41:53.000
How do I...

42:08.958 --> 42:11.458
What did you do?

42:13.625 --> 42:17.208
- What happened?
- Drive!

42:33.791 --> 42:38.666
Is he dead?
David! Is he dead?

42:50.375 --> 42:52.833
Fuck!

43:08.291 --> 43:09.833
Hey...

43:11.333 --> 43:16.000
It'll be okay.
We'll figure it out. Right?

43:22.625 --> 43:24.625
Ida?

43:24.791 --> 43:27.166
Ida!

44:41.458 --> 44:44.125
Have a seat, Ida.

44:54.083 --> 44:56.541
What's up?

44:57.750 --> 45:00.458
What happened?

45:04.083 --> 45:06.916
I don't want to live with
my aunt anymore.

45:07.083 --> 45:10.416
I'm sorry to hear that.

45:12.083 --> 45:16.625
You have to tell me what happened,
so I know how to respond to it.

45:27.125 --> 45:30.500
I'm glad you come here
when there's a problem, but...

45:30.666 --> 45:34.250
You have to speak to me,
or I can't help you.

45:34.416 --> 45:36.500
Ida?

45:42.250 --> 45:46.625
I have half an hour before my next
meeting. I'll make us some coffee.

45:46.791 --> 45:49.791
We have plenty of time.

47:10.041 --> 47:12.583
There, there...

47:17.041 --> 47:20.708
There, there, darling.

47:20.875 --> 47:24.708
Where were you?
We looked for you.

47:24.875 --> 47:27.416
Nowhere.

47:28.583 --> 47:31.541
You must have been somewhere.

47:33.666 --> 47:38.750
- At a gas station.
- All night at a gas station?

47:38.916 --> 47:41.583
That's enough.

47:48.791 --> 47:54.208
- Is he dead?
- We think so, but we're not sure.

47:54.375 --> 47:58.125
It hasn't been on the news yet.

48:02.416 --> 48:07.833
- What if she's still alone with him?
- Why wasn't she at school?

48:09.500 --> 48:12.250
Children get sick.

48:12.416 --> 48:17.458
They often get sick. You need to double
check these things before you enter.

48:20.791 --> 48:24.875
- Don't you want breakfast?
- I already ate.

48:38.708 --> 48:42.791
Come with me.
We need to wash your clothes.

49:15.250 --> 49:18.041
What are you doing?

49:19.333 --> 49:21.833
Get out!

49:23.833 --> 49:27.333
Why did you run away like that?

49:30.541 --> 49:33.500
Why did you run?

49:36.625 --> 49:39.833
Why didn't you stay with the rest of us?

49:40.000 --> 49:42.083
Get out, Jonas.

49:50.333 --> 49:52.541
Leave!

49:54.000 --> 49:56.000
Leave, Jonas!

49:58.291 --> 50:00.958
Get out!

52:06.375 --> 52:10.333
Besides that she's really easy
and mild-mannered.

52:10.500 --> 52:14.916
Yes, we were lucky with you.
Weren't we?

52:15.083 --> 52:17.791
- Hi, Ida.
- Hi.

52:17.958 --> 52:23.458
You didn't turn up
for the assessment meeting.

52:23.625 --> 52:29.166
- I must have forgotten.
- I haven't seen a letter about a meeting.

52:29.333 --> 52:36.208
- It's all electronic now.
- Why don't you have the meeting here?

52:36.375 --> 52:41.166
Unfortunately all my papers
are at the office, but thanks.

52:41.333 --> 52:44.041
Ready, Ida?

52:52.041 --> 52:57.833
I'm sorry you came all the way out here.
It was nothing. Everything's fine.

52:59.750 --> 53:02.750
Let's not talk about it here.

53:17.541 --> 53:20.166
Come in.

53:20.333 --> 53:23.958
This is Jonathan.
My friend from the police.

53:24.125 --> 53:26.916
He's very keen to talk to you.

53:29.916 --> 53:33.666
Don't be frightened, Ida.
Omar's just worried about you.

53:33.833 --> 53:37.791
And if he's worried, I'm worried.

53:37.958 --> 53:43.625
Maybe you can explain
why you came to see me this morning?

53:45.666 --> 53:48.541
It was just an argument
about allowances.

53:48.708 --> 53:52.791
I wouldn't have come if I'd known
you'd turn it into such a big deal.

53:54.041 --> 53:59.666
You wanted to live alone
when your mum died. Why was that?

54:02.750 --> 54:04.541
I don't know.

54:04.708 --> 54:10.333
I understand. I don't think you should
have been placed with them either.

54:11.916 --> 54:18.625
Did your mum tell you stories about
them? How they make their money?

54:18.791 --> 54:20.791
No.

54:20.958 --> 54:25.750
You don't have to live there anymore.
We'll help you.

54:27.791 --> 54:32.625
- Can I leave now?
- A man was killed in his home yesterday.

54:32.791 --> 54:36.625
His daughter saw a young girl
who she recognised.

54:36.791 --> 54:39.833
Her description fits you perfectly.

54:44.333 --> 54:50.416
The girl had met you when you and
a man gave her a lift home from school.

54:50.583 --> 54:53.625
Why did you drive her home?

54:58.541 --> 55:02.416
- I came because of an argument.
- She saw you, Ida.

55:02.583 --> 55:06.250
Lots of girls look like me.

55:10.333 --> 55:12.416
Ida?

55:13.875 --> 55:16.291
Ida.

55:20.916 --> 55:24.958
If you're not a witness,
you're a suspect.

55:25.125 --> 55:28.250
I won't be there next time.

55:28.416 --> 55:31.416
What did you ever do for me?

55:31.583 --> 55:35.333
There are options,
an apprenticeship maybe.

55:35.500 --> 55:38.875
They're building new youth housing.

55:43.750 --> 55:45.125
Ida?

55:45.291 --> 55:47.208
Ida!

56:10.833 --> 56:13.500
What did he want?

56:15.083 --> 56:18.541
Ida? What did he want?

56:18.708 --> 56:22.083
The police were there.

56:28.041 --> 56:30.791
What did they say?

56:34.083 --> 56:37.500
He's dead.

56:37.666 --> 56:42.250
- Okay.
- Shut up. He's dead!

56:42.416 --> 56:46.041
She saw me. The girl saw me.

56:59.708 --> 57:02.291
Hi, Mum.

57:02.458 --> 57:06.583
David? Mads?

57:06.750 --> 57:10.208
I need to speak to you. Now!

57:22.166 --> 57:25.750
What's with her?

57:25.916 --> 57:31.541
- I don't know.
- That can't all be about me.

57:38.666 --> 57:42.250
- Are you mad?
- No.

57:43.416 --> 57:48.416
- Are you sure? You seem mad at me.
- I'm not mad at you.

57:49.958 --> 57:52.000
Fine.

57:55.916 --> 57:59.166
Do you want the last slice?

58:00.708 --> 58:07.166
- There's no topping.
- I ate the pepperoni.

58:08.166 --> 58:10.291
Sorry.

58:11.833 --> 58:14.625
That's better.

58:17.666 --> 58:20.375
What's up?

58:22.875 --> 58:25.875
You need to leave.

58:27.750 --> 58:31.791
Are you talking to me? Are you?

58:31.958 --> 58:34.791
Leave.

58:41.791 --> 58:44.666
Screw you.

58:44.833 --> 58:46.916
What are you doing?

58:47.083 --> 58:50.291
What are you doing?

58:50.458 --> 58:56.083
Let me go!
That hurts. Stop it.

58:56.250 --> 58:58.708
Stop it.

58:58.875 --> 59:01.958
- Anna...
- Screw you!

59:13.958 --> 59:16.166
Ida?

59:28.500 --> 59:31.500
- Has she left?
- Yes.

59:33.500 --> 59:36.666
Why were the police there?

59:40.458 --> 59:44.250
I panicked and went to see Omar.

59:44.416 --> 59:48.666
- Ida...
- Bodil, I didn't tell them anything.

59:48.833 --> 59:52.291
I didn't tell them anything.

01:01:02.375 --> 01:01:06.708
... they have nothing.

01:01:06.875 --> 01:01:10.916
- Then why did they show up?
- They're guessing.

01:01:11.083 --> 01:01:14.291
They have nothing, Mum.

01:01:14.458 --> 01:01:17.250
- So they only asked about the car?
- Yes.

01:01:17.416 --> 01:01:21.041
I got rid of it.
They have absolutely nothing.

01:01:21.208 --> 01:01:26.333
They only sent one officer.
It's guesswork.

01:01:26.500 --> 01:01:28.083
What's going on?

01:01:28.250 --> 01:01:30.666
Have you told them anything
they can use against my boys?

01:01:30.833 --> 01:01:34.541
- Have you? Have you, Ida?
- No!

01:01:34.708 --> 01:01:39.166
What did you tell them?
You don't rat on family!

01:01:40.458 --> 01:01:43.750
- What did you tell them?
- I didn't tell them anything.

01:01:43.916 --> 01:01:46.916
- You're destroying us.
- Come on.

01:02:10.291 --> 01:02:14.416
I gave her something
to help her sleep.

01:02:16.666 --> 01:02:21.666
David is gone. It's fucked up
if he's out looking for drugs.

01:02:28.041 --> 01:02:31.583
Do you see what you've done?

01:02:35.666 --> 01:02:39.083
It's not my fault.

01:02:42.458 --> 01:02:49.083
Isn't it your fault?
You went to see Omar, didn't you?

01:02:54.833 --> 01:02:59.375
What would you have done?

01:03:05.875 --> 01:03:09.000
Listen carefully...

01:03:10.083 --> 01:03:14.458
I will do anything for my family.

01:03:21.666 --> 01:03:24.125
Sweetie?

01:03:26.208 --> 01:03:33.166
- Did the police come to our house?
- It's fine. Everything's fine.

01:03:33.333 --> 01:03:36.250
It's not a problem.

01:03:53.791 --> 01:03:58.125
No. How about this one?

01:04:02.458 --> 01:04:04.666
No, you don't like that.

01:04:09.833 --> 01:04:12.666
Never mind.

01:04:14.916 --> 01:04:20.208
She doesn't eat anything.
Come on, sweetie.

01:04:22.416 --> 01:04:24.500
Yes...

01:04:30.583 --> 01:04:36.375
- We're going to go look for him.
- Is he not picking up?

01:04:36.541 --> 01:04:40.166
No. Neither is Anna.

01:04:42.375 --> 01:04:46.125
- See you.
- Come say goodbye.

01:04:48.916 --> 01:04:51.875
Here's Dad.

01:04:52.041 --> 01:04:54.291
Bye, sweetie.

01:04:55.458 --> 01:05:00.291
- Dad has to work. See you.
- Are you coming, Ida?

01:05:02.166 --> 01:05:06.333
- Mads, we're leaving!
- The most handsome dad in the world.

01:05:06.500 --> 01:05:08.541
Yes, the most handsome dad.

01:05:23.791 --> 01:05:27.208
Why aren't you answering your phone?

01:05:28.583 --> 01:05:31.500
Have you spoken to him?

01:05:34.458 --> 01:05:36.875
Fuck you.

01:05:38.500 --> 01:05:43.750
- Have you spoken to him?
- You're so pathetic.

01:05:50.416 --> 01:05:53.375
What are you doing? Stop that.

01:05:54.458 --> 01:05:57.833
- Stop that. It hurts!
- Jonas. Jonas!

01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:01.791
Don't fuck with us, do you understand?

01:06:01.958 --> 01:06:04.833
- Jonas...
- Go away, Ida!

01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:08.041
Let go of me. Piss off, Jonas.

01:06:08.208 --> 01:06:13.416
- Have you spoken to him or not?
- What did you make him do this time?

01:06:13.583 --> 01:06:18.166
- Anna...
- What did you make him do?

01:06:19.416 --> 01:06:25.208
Come on. He doesn't tell her anything.
He just fucks her.

01:06:25.375 --> 01:06:30.125
He tells me that you always stay
in the car like a little bitch.

01:06:39.333 --> 01:06:45.750
- Ida, get her out of here. Now.
- What the hell is wrong with you?

01:06:45.916 --> 01:06:49.625
- You're insane!
- Go home, Anna!

01:07:09.333 --> 01:07:12.875
Why doesn't he pick up his phone?

01:07:15.375 --> 01:07:18.333
I hate it when he does this.

01:07:20.625 --> 01:07:24.875
- Have you told them?
- My parents?

01:07:27.500 --> 01:07:30.791
They haven't even met David.

01:07:34.333 --> 01:07:38.250
- Can I have a look?
- Sure.

01:07:39.250 --> 01:07:45.083
You can't really see anything yet,
but my breasts are getting bigger.

01:07:53.625 --> 01:07:56.500
Can you hear anything?

01:08:12.083 --> 01:08:14.416
What is it?

01:08:18.666 --> 01:08:20.957
What is it?

01:08:24.791 --> 01:08:27.291
Are you sure you want to keep it?

01:08:31.416 --> 01:08:34.750
Maybe he doesn't want to be a dad.

01:08:36.207 --> 01:08:39.207
Has he said anything to you?

01:08:40.250 --> 01:08:43.666
He doesn't even call you his girlfriend.

01:08:45.625 --> 01:08:48.582
But I am his girlfriend, Ida.

01:08:50.207 --> 01:08:55.375
I know. But that doesn't mean
you have to keep it.

01:08:58.957 --> 01:09:02.125
Why wouldn't I keep it?

01:09:05.207 --> 01:09:07.457
What's wrong?

01:09:35.332 --> 01:09:37.207
Sorry.

01:10:24.625 --> 01:10:27.833
I'm sorry I shouted at you.

01:10:31.291 --> 01:10:34.041
I didn't mean to scare you.

01:10:35.041 --> 01:10:38.291
It's okay.

01:10:45.083 --> 01:10:48.333
They haven't come back yet?

01:10:55.625 --> 01:10:59.083
I don't know how to help them.

01:11:08.333 --> 01:11:11.791
I don't know how to help them.

01:11:32.750 --> 01:11:36.250
Come on. You're going to bed.

01:11:38.125 --> 01:11:40.416
The girl only saw you, right?

01:11:44.125 --> 01:11:46.500
Yes.

01:11:46.666 --> 01:11:48.958
Come on.

01:11:58.291 --> 01:12:01.833
Will you lie with me until they get home?

01:13:24.250 --> 01:13:26.666
- Hi.
- Good morning.

01:13:26.833 --> 01:13:30.375
- Good morning.
- Take this one.

01:13:30.541 --> 01:13:33.958
- Did you find him?
- Yes.

01:13:35.541 --> 01:13:40.041
- How is he?
- Not well.

01:13:44.291 --> 01:13:46.666
No thanks.

01:13:54.708 --> 01:13:57.666
The girl saw you,
and we can't change that.

01:14:04.208 --> 01:14:09.708
They'll bring you in for questioning.
You know that, right?

01:14:15.208 --> 01:14:18.125
You can help the boys, Ida.

01:14:20.916 --> 01:14:23.458
You can help David.

01:14:25.208 --> 01:14:30.166
You're a minor,
and you have no criminal record.

01:14:36.958 --> 01:14:41.958
If they take... If they take
all four of you, I'll have no one.

01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:52.416
What do you want me to do?

01:14:52.583 --> 01:14:54.708
Just don't tell them anything.

01:14:57.500 --> 01:15:00.583
Don't say anything.

01:15:00.750 --> 01:15:03.708
I know you can do that.

01:15:10.250 --> 01:15:12.958
Right, beautiful?

01:15:23.625 --> 01:15:26.250
Sweetie.

01:16:55.083 --> 01:16:58.125
Ida, you have visitors.

01:17:17.041 --> 01:17:21.166
There she is.

01:17:23.125 --> 01:17:25.875
Hi, Ida.

01:17:26.041 --> 01:17:30.083
- Is everything alright?
- Yes.

01:17:30.250 --> 01:17:34.375
- Thanks.
- It's so good to see you.

01:17:34.541 --> 01:17:38.916
- Where's Mia?
- She's at the nursery. It's a long drive.

01:17:39.083 --> 01:17:44.583
- She made a drawing for you.
- I'd call it doodles.

01:17:45.833 --> 01:17:49.125
- We miss you.
- Are they treating you well?

01:17:49.291 --> 01:17:51.750
- Yes.
- How are the other girls?

01:17:51.916 --> 01:17:55.041
They fight a lot.

01:17:55.208 --> 01:17:59.500
- But they're not bothering you?
- Otherwise you let us know.

01:18:04.291 --> 01:18:08.166
Hey. The toilet was
all the way down the hall.

01:18:08.333 --> 01:18:10.333
Hi.

01:18:12.833 --> 01:18:16.208
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:18:17.208 --> 01:18:22.583
- You're getting so big.
- Isn't she beautiful?

01:18:24.375 --> 01:18:27.750
We don't know
if it's a boy or a girl.

01:18:28.875 --> 01:18:30.708
And...

01:18:30.875 --> 01:18:36.041
Anna almost asked at her last scan.
I had to cover her mouth.

01:18:36.208 --> 01:18:39.208
It should be a surprise.

01:18:39.375 --> 01:18:44.375
And we've done up the basement,
so it's ready for the young couple.

01:18:44.541 --> 01:18:48.416
With a really lovely nursery.

01:18:48.583 --> 01:18:55.375
And David, should we put the baby
changing table in the old utility room?

01:18:57.583 --> 01:19:03.166
I don't know, Mum. You decide.

01:19:03.333 --> 01:19:07.791
And Mia's really looking forward
to getting a playmate.

01:19:07.958 --> 01:19:12.875
She'll probably be jealous
once the baby's here.

01:19:13.041 --> 01:19:18.791
- No. The boys were never jealous.
- Is that quite true?

01:19:18.958 --> 01:19:23.166
David, were you jealous of Mads?

01:19:24.166 --> 01:19:28.958
Perhaps David was
a bit jealous of Mads to start with.

01:19:29.125 --> 01:19:33.833
But you were never jealous
of the little ones.

01:19:34.833 --> 01:19:37.416
No.

01:19:37.583 --> 01:19:40.916
Your room looks the same.

01:19:46.083 --> 01:19:51.750
I'll come back soon.
Let me know if you need anything. Bye.

01:20:13.583 --> 01:20:16.125
Bye.

01:20:22.333 --> 01:20:23.875
David...

01:20:24.041 --> 01:20:26.500
David!

01:20:36.083 --> 01:20:41.250
People I don't even know
ask me all sorts of questions.

01:20:41.416 --> 01:20:47.791
They say we have plenty of time. That
we'll find out what went wrong together.

01:20:50.291 --> 01:20:54.083
But for some people things go wrong
before they even begin.

01:22:09.875 --> 01:22:14.541
- Do you want anything?
- No thanks. I just need to sit down.

01:22:14.708 --> 01:22:17.583
My feet are aching.

01:22:53.666 --> 01:22:56.083
Mum?

01:23:37.083 --> 01:23:41.000
Breathe calmly. Anna! Breathe calmly.

01:23:42.291 --> 01:23:46.333
Relax!
You're hurting your child.

01:23:46.500 --> 01:23:49.916
We need to take your pants off.

01:23:50.083 --> 01:23:53.166
Stop.

01:23:56.875 --> 01:24:01.333
- Take it easy, Anna.
- I don't want it!

01:24:01.500 --> 01:24:03.791
Get it out!

01:24:03.958 --> 01:24:06.708
Get it out.

01:24:06.875 --> 01:24:11.833
Please...
Won't you help me?

01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:15.083
Anna, it'll be fine.

01:24:15.250 --> 01:24:18.208
Get it out. I don't want it.

01:24:18.375 --> 01:24:21.166
There's a contraction.

01:24:21.333 --> 01:24:23.291
Push, push, push!

01:24:23.458 --> 01:24:25.625
And breathe.

01:24:25.791 --> 01:24:27.958
You need to try...

01:24:28.125 --> 01:24:30.333
And push.

01:24:30.500 --> 01:24:33.375
Take a deep breath and push.

01:24:35.541 --> 01:24:37.750
Well done!

01:24:37.916 --> 01:24:41.041
Breathe deeply,
so the baby gets oxygen.

01:24:42.541 --> 01:24:45.208
There's another contraction.

01:24:45.375 --> 01:24:51.500
Breathe deeply and push. Listen to me!
Breathe deeply and push.

01:24:51.666 --> 01:24:55.041
- Breathe...
-... and push!

01:24:55.208 --> 01:24:58.958
Well done, Anna.
