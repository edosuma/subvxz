WEBVTT

01:47.565 --> 01:50.026
This doesn't happen as much as it used to.

01:50.777 --> 01:52.278
Us walking home together.

01:52.612 --> 01:54.072
-Hmm.
-It's the nicest.

01:54.155 --> 01:55.031
Agreed.

01:56.032 --> 01:59.119
-What are you guys doing for Thanksgiving?
-It's not that big a holiday for us.

01:59.202 --> 02:01.996
Aunt Hilda and I watch the Macy's
Thanksgiving Day Parade in the morning,

02:02.080 --> 02:05.041
and Aunt Zee watches
whatever football games are on.

02:05.125 --> 02:08.002
-Your Aunt Zelda's a football fan?
-All contact sports.

02:08.461 --> 02:11.965
Then, it's the movies and Chinese food.
How about you guys?

02:12.257 --> 02:15.510
My Grandpa's coming, which means
lots of beer-drinking and deer-hunting.

02:15.593 --> 02:17.220
-Since when do you--
-I don't.

02:17.303 --> 02:20.849
But since I'm working at the mines now,
honoring the "Kinkle legacy,"

02:21.141 --> 02:23.643
-they said I could join 'em.
-Just promise me you'll be careful.

02:23.935 --> 02:24.769
I will.

02:26.187 --> 02:28.815
-I'm kind of excited about it.
-Do you wanna come in?

02:29.232 --> 02:30.108
To say hi?

02:30.525 --> 02:31.359
Sure.

02:35.071 --> 02:39.117
Actually, Harvey, I forgot,
my aunts are having some people over.

02:39.200 --> 02:40.618
Can we take a rain check?

02:40.952 --> 02:44.539
-Uh... Yeah, sure, but--
-Thanks so much for understanding.

02:44.622 --> 02:46.499
I'll see you at school tomorrow. Bye.

02:48.293 --> 02:49.127
Bye.

02:56.926 --> 03:00.305
Aunties

03:01.306 --> 03:04.559
Can anyone explain why it looks like
The Texas Chainsaw Massacre

03:04.642 --> 03:06.060
has been nailed to our door?

03:06.144 --> 03:07.353
Oh, dear.

03:07.437 --> 03:09.480
I'll get some soap and sponges.

03:09.564 --> 03:12.859
And I'll get a plastic bag
to collect the lamb entrails.

03:12.942 --> 03:17.488
It's a message from the Council, Sabrina.
It means our family's been selected

03:17.572 --> 03:19.824
to participate in this year's
Feast of Feasts.

03:20.992 --> 03:25.288
Feast of Feasts, Sabrina,
is one of our coven's holiest holidays.

03:25.371 --> 03:28.791
It's similar to mortal Thanksgiving, but--

03:28.875 --> 03:31.336
The menu is slightly different.

03:31.753 --> 03:34.881
It's meant to honor
the single greatest sacrifice a witch

03:34.964 --> 03:36.758
ever made to save her coven.

03:37.258 --> 03:40.261
Praise Sister Freya. May we meet again.

03:41.012 --> 03:41.930
Who's Freya?

03:42.430 --> 03:44.265
A queen amongst witches.

03:44.349 --> 03:45.600
Centuries ago,

03:45.683 --> 03:48.728
the 14 women belonging
to the earliest incarnation

03:48.811 --> 03:52.482
of the Church of Night were chased
out of the township of Greendale...

03:52.565 --> 03:54.525
into the hills, the forest.

03:54.901 --> 03:55.818
Hilda.

03:56.069 --> 03:59.030
The men of Greendale
had hunted all the animals.

03:59.113 --> 04:01.241
So, you know, really,
there was nothing to eat.

04:01.324 --> 04:03.868
The witches would've starved
and died that winter,

04:03.952 --> 04:08.790
had it not been for the sacrifices
of Freya, the youngest, strongest witch.

04:09.123 --> 04:10.291
She, um...

04:13.294 --> 04:16.798
Freya slit her own throat and offered up
her body so that the coven would have

04:16.881 --> 04:19.425
sustenance through the cold months,
into the spring.

04:19.884 --> 04:22.011
-Praise Freya!
-Praise Freya!

04:22.095 --> 04:25.723
Wait, are we seriously
talking about cannibalism?

04:25.807 --> 04:27.392
It's not unlike the Donner Party.

04:27.475 --> 04:30.144
The Feast of Feasts
is an annual demonstration

04:30.228 --> 04:32.939
of our devotion to the Dark Lord.

04:33.773 --> 04:39.821
Fourteen families from the coven
are selected to participate in a, uh...

04:40.738 --> 04:41.572
a lottery.

04:41.906 --> 04:44.409
The families then choose someone
to represent them.

04:44.492 --> 04:47.287
-A tribute, as it were.
-Only ladies are eligible because--

04:47.370 --> 04:48.913
It is the Dark Lord's will.

04:48.997 --> 04:50.415
In any case...

04:50.498 --> 04:52.500
...the 14 tributes draw lots to see

04:52.583 --> 04:54.752
who will win the honor of being queen.

04:54.836 --> 04:56.296
What do you get as queen?

04:56.379 --> 04:59.132
You get to be the main course.

04:59.215 --> 05:03.136
The queen is eaten?
And witches participate in this...

05:03.678 --> 05:04.512
willingly?

05:04.595 --> 05:06.222
It is a sacred tradition.

05:07.056 --> 05:11.978
Our obligation is not to question,
it is to obey and participate.

05:12.061 --> 05:13.980
But no one's starving anymore.

05:14.063 --> 05:16.274
And we're talking about murder here.

05:16.357 --> 05:19.193
Ritual sacrifice. It's slightly different.

05:19.277 --> 05:23.406
Since Hilda's been excommunicated,
only Sabrina and I are eligible

05:23.489 --> 05:25.908
for the lottery, which means that...

05:25.992 --> 05:28.828
...I will represent the family
at tomorrow night's drawing.

05:28.911 --> 05:32.332
No, no, no. No. Aunt Zelda, you can't.

05:33.166 --> 05:34.417
What if you get picked?

05:35.168 --> 05:37.378
Aunt Hilda Back me up here!

05:37.879 --> 05:41.007
We Spellmans are an endangered species.

05:41.674 --> 05:43.092
I lost my mom and my dad...

05:44.927 --> 05:46.471
I don't want to lose you, too.

05:49.849 --> 05:51.392
That's sweet, Sabrina...

05:53.227 --> 05:54.729
but your Aunt Hilda and I

05:54.812 --> 05:58.483
have participated in many lotteries
over the years,

05:58.566 --> 06:03.696
and the Dark Lord has never seen fit
to reward us with being queen.

06:04.489 --> 06:07.450
I have no reason to believe
this year will be any different.

06:08.076 --> 06:10.703
So please,
the Feast of Feasts is happening,

06:10.787 --> 06:13.915
and like it or not, we are participating.

06:17.251 --> 06:18.669
Don't forget--

06:22.924 --> 06:24.801
It's Thanksgiving week, class,

06:24.884 --> 06:27.512
and I want to talk about you
and this town.

06:27.804 --> 06:31.307
Your family trees tell the tale
of Greendale.

06:31.891 --> 06:36.896
So, how well do you know your roots?

06:37.230 --> 06:40.525
For instance, you, Mr. Kinkle.

06:41.275 --> 06:43.736
When did your family come to Greendale?

06:44.028 --> 06:45.238
I'm not exactly sure.

06:45.488 --> 06:48.199
How did they come to own the mines

06:48.908 --> 06:50.451
I don't-- I don't know.

06:50.618 --> 06:52.495
Well, you've got some digging to do.

06:52.829 --> 06:53.996
All of you do.

06:55.164 --> 06:59.419
The assignment this week
is to research your own family history.

06:59.502 --> 07:04.048
It's time we got to know ourselves,
and each other... better.

07:05.633 --> 07:07.552
Class is dismissed.

07:08.469 --> 07:12.849
Ms. Wardwell, have you ever heard
of witches celebrating

07:12.932 --> 07:15.017
something called Feast of Feasts?

07:15.810 --> 07:16.936
Hmm.

07:17.728 --> 07:22.024
My former coven, the Church of Shadows,
had a comparable ritual.

07:22.108 --> 07:24.569
-It's a--
-Do you know if there's any way to...

07:25.278 --> 07:26.529
opt out of it?

07:26.904 --> 07:28.698
Or stop it?

07:28.990 --> 07:31.325
Not off the top of my head,

07:31.409 --> 07:33.661
but I could do some research, if you like.

07:34.036 --> 07:37.039
That would be great, Ms. Wardwell,
and I'll do the same.

07:39.584 --> 07:40.626
Thank you.

07:41.544 --> 07:45.381
Yes, Sabrina. I'll do my research,

07:45.465 --> 07:51.179
and see if Mr. Kinkle's...
yields anything of note.

07:52.138 --> 07:55.141
Grandpa, I'm supposed to write
a paper on our family history.

07:55.475 --> 07:56.893
Have we always been miners?

07:57.768 --> 08:01.147
Not always. Back in the early days,
when we were Von Kunkles,

08:01.230 --> 08:02.482
we hunted and trapped.

08:03.524 --> 08:06.110
And then, there was that terrible winter.

08:06.861 --> 08:09.322
-And those people.
-What people?

08:09.405 --> 08:13.117
Well, no one knew where they came from,
but they lived on the outskirts of town.

08:13.367 --> 08:17.955
And the townsfolk used to say
that they were tunneling in them hills.

08:18.498 --> 08:21.083
They claimed we stole their land.

08:21.167 --> 08:23.544
Did we

08:23.628 --> 08:26.047
The hill people scared the town folk.

08:26.631 --> 08:29.884
And it was decided
that someone should get rid of them,

08:29.967 --> 08:31.219
and that duty fell to us.

08:32.220 --> 08:34.263
And after they were gone,
we made use of the land.

08:34.347 --> 08:37.266
What happened to the people

08:38.100 --> 08:40.436
You're coming hunting with us this year,
ain't you?

08:42.355 --> 08:44.065
I'll show you what happened.

08:46.901 --> 08:49.403
Your Uncle Jesse kept track
of the family history.

08:49.737 --> 08:52.448
Things that most people
would've got rid of, he kept.

08:53.824 --> 08:55.868
That's Dorothea Putnam.

08:56.118 --> 08:58.996
First of our family to arrive from Europe
and settle in Greendale.

08:59.080 --> 09:00.331
Dorothea?

09:02.166 --> 09:04.460
-But she's dressed like a man.
-Oh.

09:05.044 --> 09:06.420
It was the frontier.

09:07.672 --> 09:09.173
She lived by herself for a while.

09:09.257 --> 09:13.636
Safer for a woman in that time to...
wear men's clothing, I guess.

09:17.348 --> 09:20.226
Those will be her journals.

09:20.309 --> 09:22.270
Never got all the way through them myself.

09:23.104 --> 09:24.814
Nana Ruth?

09:25.982 --> 09:29.068
It's me. Rosalind.

09:29.151 --> 09:31.028
Come closer, baby.

09:31.112 --> 09:33.281
It's been too long.

09:34.657 --> 09:37.618
Bless you, sweet girl.

09:37.785 --> 09:43.708
Nana, at school, we were asked
to research our personal histories--

09:43.791 --> 09:48.713
Oh. I thought you came to talk to me
because you was worrying

09:48.796 --> 09:52.008
you don't have enough faith,
which is nonsense.

09:52.508 --> 09:54.427
Did Dad call you

09:54.510 --> 09:56.012
No.

09:57.263 --> 10:01.434
The cunning tells me what I need to know.

10:01.517 --> 10:05.563
The cunning... what is that?

10:05.646 --> 10:08.566
It's a... a hunch.

10:09.567 --> 10:14.614
A sixth sense in your bones
that helps us to see things...

10:15.114 --> 10:20.369
when others,
like your daddy, remain blind.

10:21.495 --> 10:26.751
My cunning started to manifest
when I was just about your age.

10:27.460 --> 10:28.753
And yours...

10:29.712 --> 10:32.673
Yours should be starting up now...

10:34.342 --> 10:36.052
if it hasn't already.

10:41.140 --> 10:43.601
I can't believe
you're one of the 14 tributes, Prudence.

10:43.684 --> 10:44.560
Why not?

10:44.644 --> 10:47.480
All night long, I prayed and prayed
to the Dark Lord, didn't I?

10:47.563 --> 10:49.732
-Yes, but so did I.
-So did I.

10:49.815 --> 10:53.611
Don't be jealous, girls.
Maybe it'll be your turn next year.

10:53.694 --> 10:56.572
Wait, Prudence,
you're a part of this lottery?

10:56.656 --> 11:00.242
There were entrails on her bed,
but she's always been lucky that way.

11:00.493 --> 11:02.453
Lucky? Hang on.

11:02.912 --> 11:04.205
You actually want this?

11:04.497 --> 11:06.123
You want to be sacrificed?

11:06.207 --> 11:08.459
More than I've ever wanted anything
in my life.

11:08.542 --> 11:11.087
But that's insane. Why?

11:11.170 --> 11:13.589
You wouldn't understand,
half-breed, you're not a real witch.

11:13.673 --> 11:16.300
But there is no greater honor.

11:16.384 --> 11:19.011
Imagine, an orphan being queen.

11:19.095 --> 11:21.931
It would be the first time in the history
of the Church of Night.

11:23.099 --> 11:24.892
Nicholas, wait. Wait up.

11:26.310 --> 11:29.188
Where do you stand on the Feast of Feasts?

11:29.563 --> 11:31.273
I'm a conscientious objector.

11:31.899 --> 11:33.275
I think it's bonkers.

11:33.359 --> 11:34.276
Thank you.

11:34.360 --> 11:37.530
Your father actually banned
Feast of Feasts when he was High Priest.

11:37.863 --> 11:40.741
-He said it was barbaric.
-So, why is it happening again?

11:40.825 --> 11:43.661
Well, Blackwood reinstated it
the year he became High Priest.

11:44.203 --> 11:46.872
He received a "revelation"
from the Dark Lord

11:46.956 --> 11:48.499
to return to our old rituals.

11:50.292 --> 11:52.545
Wait, you're not a tribute, are you?

11:52.628 --> 11:55.297
No. My Aunt Zelda
is putting herself forth...

11:58.008 --> 12:00.219
but I wonder if she'd feel differently
about the feast

12:00.302 --> 12:01.929
if I were on the chopping block.

12:02.388 --> 12:03.222
Hmm.

12:09.645 --> 12:12.148
Oh, let me burn white, Dark Lord.

12:13.149 --> 12:14.233
Let it be me.

12:14.567 --> 12:16.444
Delighted to see you, Sister Mildred.

12:24.243 --> 12:27.163
Tonight we celebrate
a time-honored tradition.

12:27.538 --> 12:31.792
The Feast of Feasts is a reminder...

12:32.376 --> 12:35.254
that even the humblest amongst us
can be lifted up...

12:35.713 --> 12:37.882
to sit with the Dark Lord.

12:38.299 --> 12:40.509
And that the survival of the coven
is greater

12:40.593 --> 12:43.053
than the life of any individual witch.

12:44.805 --> 12:50.019
Sisters, let the Dark Lord's will
be revealed.

12:51.103 --> 12:52.938
Stop!

13:01.530 --> 13:02.406
I'll draw.

13:03.240 --> 13:05.117
I'll draw for the Spellman family.

13:05.868 --> 13:08.579
Sabrina, what in Satan's name
are you doing?

13:09.079 --> 13:12.750
I'm upholding a beloved tradition,
Aunt Zelda,

13:13.417 --> 13:18.380
unless, of course, you want to admit
that this whole thing is barbaric,

13:18.464 --> 13:20.257
as my father believed!

13:21.008 --> 13:23.052
Sister Zelda, is there a problem?

13:33.020 --> 13:34.313
No, Your Excellency.

13:35.231 --> 13:38.651
My brave niece would like to represent
the family this year.

13:38.734 --> 13:41.153
So, Sabrina, by all means, go ahead.

13:45.032 --> 13:46.242
Select your paper.

14:06.762 --> 14:07.763
Burn them.

14:32.663 --> 14:34.081
Prudence is queen.

14:39.169 --> 14:41.797
I told you.

14:41.922 --> 14:43.632
Lucky witch.

14:49.471 --> 14:51.307
When will it be my turn?

14:58.981 --> 15:01.525
All hail, Queen of the Feast!

15:01.775 --> 15:04.862
All hail, Queen of the Feast!

15:06.614 --> 15:08.616
Kneel before your queen!

15:21.670 --> 15:24.048
Do you realize how close you came
to being sacrificed?

15:24.131 --> 15:26.508
I didn't think you would let me go through
with the drawing.

15:26.592 --> 15:30.179
Oh, so it's my fault that you decided
to play a game of chicken with me

15:30.262 --> 15:32.306
in front of the entire coven. That's rich.

15:32.389 --> 15:33.891
Right, well, what's done is done.

15:33.974 --> 15:37.269
Let's just praise Satan.
He decided to spare you both.

15:37.519 --> 15:38.562
Not entirely.

15:38.646 --> 15:40.648
Sabrina drew the lot of handmaiden.

15:40.731 --> 15:42.274
Better to be the shepherd than the lamb.

15:42.358 --> 15:45.027
Which means what, exactly?
Aunt Zelda still hasn't told me.

15:45.110 --> 15:48.614
The lamb is the queen
and the shepherd is the handmaiden.

15:48.989 --> 15:51.492
The queen's exaltation
is the highest honor,

15:51.575 --> 15:52.993
so for the next three days,

15:53.077 --> 15:55.663
while the coven fasts
and prepares for the feast,

15:56.080 --> 15:59.083
the handmaiden must indulge
the queen's every whim.

15:59.416 --> 16:02.711
Great! So I'm supposed to spoil the girl
who harrowed me.

16:02.795 --> 16:06.715
Preferably with figs and wild berries
to sweeten her meat before the feast.

16:07.216 --> 16:09.093
That's not even funny, Ambrose.

16:09.176 --> 16:11.220
Oh, come on, cous, it is a little funny.

16:11.303 --> 16:15.391
Prudence getting her just desserts
by literally becoming the dessert.

16:25.693 --> 16:27.152
Why, hello there.

16:27.569 --> 16:28.946
Who might you be?

16:29.279 --> 16:30.864
I'm Queen of the Feast.

16:32.408 --> 16:34.243
In that case, do come on in.

16:34.743 --> 16:36.453
-Prudence.
-Handmaiden.

16:38.706 --> 16:40.457
I assume my room's upstairs?

16:41.333 --> 16:44.712
I'm dying for a warm buttermilk bath.

16:45.504 --> 16:47.131
And a plate of macaroons.

17:11.071 --> 17:12.573
You can do my back now.

17:19.913 --> 17:20.789
Tell me, handmaiden,

17:20.873 --> 17:23.417
will this be your first time
supping on witch flesh?

17:23.500 --> 17:27.337
What? I'm not going to eat you, Prudence.

17:27.880 --> 17:30.507
You don't have to go through
with this madness, you know.

17:30.591 --> 17:33.343
I mean, just between us,
you don't really want to be queen, do you?

17:33.427 --> 17:34.678
Of course I do.

17:34.762 --> 17:38.640
But if you wanted to escape,
I would happily look the other way.

17:38.724 --> 17:40.559
Why would I want to escape?

17:41.018 --> 17:43.312
I'm about to be transubstantiated.

17:47.232 --> 17:48.192
Meaning?

17:48.692 --> 17:50.360
After the coven consumes my body,

17:50.444 --> 17:55.699
I will be a part of every single witch
in the Church of Night, forever.

17:55.783 --> 17:57.201
But that's not even the best part.

17:57.534 --> 18:00.788
My spirit will reside
in the Dark Lord's heart,

18:00.871 --> 18:02.289
alongside the other queens,

18:02.372 --> 18:04.875
basking in the glow of his glorious fire

18:04.958 --> 18:07.669
until the trumpets of the apocalypse
are sounded.

18:07.753 --> 18:09.004
And you believe that?

18:09.088 --> 18:10.756
With absolute certainty.

18:10.839 --> 18:13.258
But what if that's not what happens?

18:15.010 --> 18:18.138
What if you're sacrificed and...

18:19.181 --> 18:21.433
it's just over?

18:21.809 --> 18:23.102
Is that what you believe?

18:23.936 --> 18:26.188
I don't know what happens
when we die. It's...

18:26.355 --> 18:27.606
It's impossible to know.

18:27.689 --> 18:29.817
Yes, but what do you believe?

18:30.651 --> 18:31.652
Huh?

18:32.694 --> 18:33.987
How sad for you.

18:35.489 --> 18:37.324
Not to have faith in anything.

18:46.708 --> 18:48.210
Where are you going to sleep?

19:17.489 --> 19:19.700
Ambrose?

19:32.588 --> 19:33.547
Nicholas?

19:35.465 --> 19:36.592
What are you doing here?

19:37.301 --> 19:38.635
I invited him, handmaiden.

19:38.719 --> 19:42.514
And no plebe can deny a queen
on the days leading up to her sacrifice.

19:42.931 --> 19:46.310
It also helps that darling Nicky here
is hornier than a toad.

19:47.895 --> 19:48.937
Join us, Sabrina.

19:50.272 --> 19:51.190
Uh...

19:52.274 --> 19:54.484
-Nicholas...
-Or we can go to your room.

19:56.069 --> 19:57.279
Just the two of us.

19:59.489 --> 20:01.200
Uh, I--

20:01.283 --> 20:03.076
You're killing the mood, shepherd.

20:03.535 --> 20:06.163
Either get in or get out!

20:18.008 --> 20:19.134
Sleep well, Prudence?

20:19.927 --> 20:21.803
Like the dead.

20:23.972 --> 20:25.849
I was going over what you asked me.

20:25.933 --> 20:28.602
And I still don't know what I believe
when it comes to death.

20:28.977 --> 20:31.563
But I believe that life, all life...

20:32.648 --> 20:35.108
even the life of someone
who tried to kill me...

20:36.068 --> 20:36.985
is precious.

20:37.236 --> 20:39.154
Witch life, mortal life.

20:39.238 --> 20:42.866
Eternal life, which is what awaits me
after the feast.

20:42.950 --> 20:45.577
And there's nothing I can say or do
to make you change your mind?

20:45.661 --> 20:46.745
No.

20:47.537 --> 20:49.623
Okay, well...

20:51.458 --> 20:53.377
if there's no talking you out of this.

20:53.877 --> 20:56.797
Wait. Where are you going, handmaiden?

20:57.047 --> 20:58.173
Baxter High.

20:58.590 --> 20:59.841
To live my life.

21:00.008 --> 21:02.886
As fully as possible,
for as long as possible.

21:02.970 --> 21:05.013
The shepherd is meant
to take care of the lamb.

21:05.097 --> 21:06.014
Hmm.

21:07.474 --> 21:10.477
-You can come with me, if you want.
-And why would I do that?

21:10.686 --> 21:11.687
Boys.

21:12.854 --> 21:15.482
Lots and lots of mortal boys.

21:15.732 --> 21:16.817
To torment.

21:17.109 --> 21:18.235
And seduce.

21:18.902 --> 21:19.736
Or both.

21:20.279 --> 21:24.366
Who knows, Prudence, maybe you'll find
the meaning of life at Baxter High.

21:24.449 --> 21:25.951
Oh, you had me at boys to torment.

21:28.620 --> 21:32.082
Ms. Wardwell, pardon the, uh, intrusion.

21:35.419 --> 21:37.838
What can I, um...

21:40.257 --> 21:42.592
do for you, Principal Hawthorne?

21:42.926 --> 21:45.345
Any big plans for the holiday weekend?

21:45.887 --> 21:49.516
Because you would be welcome at my house.

21:50.892 --> 21:53.020
I have my own rituals.

21:55.897 --> 21:57.024
I order in.

21:57.941 --> 21:59.151
Perhaps next time.

22:00.319 --> 22:02.529
When I'm in the mood for a real meal.

22:02.988 --> 22:04.072
Oh, yeah.

22:07.701 --> 22:10.287
Guys, this is Prudence.

22:10.495 --> 22:12.873
She's my cousin
who's visiting for Thanksgiving.

22:13.290 --> 22:16.084
Prudence, this is my boyfriend, Harvey.

22:16.168 --> 22:18.670
And my two best friends,
Rosalind and Susie.

22:19.921 --> 22:22.883
Very nice to meet you. You promised me boys.

22:22.966 --> 22:24.843
I wanted you
to meet my friends first.

22:24.926 --> 22:27.763
So, what are we talking about?

22:28.388 --> 22:30.766
Uh... My ancestor Dorothea.

22:30.849 --> 22:34.353
She was an early settler in Greendale,
and was also a pirate

22:34.436 --> 22:38.023
who helped a group of women fleeing
religious persecution from Scotland.

22:38.106 --> 22:41.651
Dorothea Putnam?
We learned about her at my school.

22:41.735 --> 22:45.697
She was a true ally to those women.
A hero to the marrow.

22:46.031 --> 22:47.949
So I'm discovering.

22:48.450 --> 22:50.285
Did you turn up anything, Harvey?

22:51.161 --> 22:53.455
Yeah, but it's kind of messed up.

22:54.039 --> 22:56.875
Basically, the Kinkles got ownership
of the mines in a...

22:56.958 --> 23:00.921
a land grab. Kicked some people out
who lived in the hills and took them over.

23:01.254 --> 23:03.882
-What does that mean?
-By "kicked out," he means killed.

23:03.965 --> 23:05.801
And by "took over," he means stole.

23:07.010 --> 23:08.595
What did you say your family name is?

23:08.887 --> 23:09.888
-Harvey?
-Kinkle.

23:10.180 --> 23:12.307
So you're a descendant
of the Von Kunkles, then.

23:13.600 --> 23:16.895
Those "hill people"
your ancestors killed were witches.

23:16.978 --> 23:18.397
Which makes your family witch--

23:18.480 --> 23:20.440
Come on,
everybody knows witches aren't real.

23:20.524 --> 23:24.152
Your family committed atrocities,
and blood-atonement is demanded.

23:24.236 --> 23:26.279
-Kidding! She's kidding.
-Wait, hang on.

23:26.571 --> 23:31.243
Uh, I am going to show her the rest of
school, but we will see you guys later!

23:31.326 --> 23:33.453
Bye.

23:33.912 --> 23:36.123
Did you honestly think
I would find meaning here?

23:36.498 --> 23:38.333
Amongst your mortal friends?

23:38.417 --> 23:41.211
They don't even know the glorious truth
of what you are.

23:41.420 --> 23:43.922
-And your beau is a witch hunter!
-No, he's not.

23:47.843 --> 23:50.137
kill them before they have the chance
to kill us.

23:50.220 --> 23:54.099
Prudence, if you lay a finger on Harvey,
I swear to Satan, I'll tear you to pieces.

23:54.182 --> 23:56.226
-Save it for Feast Day.
-You're deluded.

23:56.309 --> 23:57.936
Girls, girls.

24:00.272 --> 24:03.191
Let's not be catty bitches, hmm?

24:04.818 --> 24:09.322
Sabrina, aren't you gonna introduce me
to your new gal pal?

24:10.490 --> 24:12.284
And I know it's witch tradition,

24:12.367 --> 24:16.204
but can you please
talk some sense into her, Ms. Wardwell,

24:16.288 --> 24:20.709
and tell her that there's absolutely
no purpose to the feast?

24:20.792 --> 24:23.795
Not when the cost is precious life.

24:23.879 --> 24:27.591
But the reward is everlasting glory
in the Dark Lord's heart.

24:28.383 --> 24:31.803
And who is this woman
that we can discuss our ways with her?

24:31.887 --> 24:33.138
We can trust Ms. Wardwell.

24:33.221 --> 24:36.183
She's a witch, too,
excommunicated from another coven.

24:38.435 --> 24:41.563
You expect me to take advice
from an excommunicate?

24:42.022 --> 24:46.651
Don't be a snob, Prudence.
Ms. Wardwell is incredibly learned.

24:46.735 --> 24:51.198
And, as promised, I have done some digging
into the Feast of Feasts

24:51.281 --> 24:54.576
and it's a... a complicated matter.

24:55.076 --> 24:59.915
Now, you may not want to listen
to an excommunicate,

24:59.998 --> 25:03.835
but there is someone
perhaps you should meet.

25:05.212 --> 25:10.509
A witch who was once Queen of the Feast,
until she rejected the crown.

25:10.967 --> 25:14.471
She lives deep in the Greendale Woods.

25:15.263 --> 25:19.768
Moon Valley,
if you're brave enough to find her.

25:19.851 --> 25:22.229
A witch spurned queenship?

25:22.646 --> 25:24.231
I don't believe it.

25:25.273 --> 25:28.401
Well, if your faith is
as strong as you say it is, Prudence...

25:29.277 --> 25:31.154
what's the harm in hearing her story?

25:34.407 --> 25:35.700
If I go...

25:36.993 --> 25:38.745
I want my sisters to come with us.

25:38.954 --> 25:40.705
The more, the merrier.

25:41.164 --> 25:45.252
And Satan knows
who we might chance upon in the woods.

25:48.463 --> 25:50.799
Thanksgiving was
Connor's favorite holiday.

25:51.424 --> 25:53.718
Mrs. Kemper, I can't even imagine

25:54.177 --> 25:57.097
how difficult this time of year
must be for you.

25:58.515 --> 26:01.643
But he's probably snug-as-a-bug...

26:03.228 --> 26:06.523
in this lovely little urn
you picked out for him for his ashes.

26:07.482 --> 26:09.609
Pop that on the mantelpiece, eh?

26:10.110 --> 26:14.281
Are there any leads regarding his, um...

26:15.198 --> 26:17.617
Well, nothing from the police,

26:18.201 --> 26:23.456
but, uh... I found some things.

26:23.540 --> 26:25.292
What sort of things, Mrs. Kemper?

26:25.375 --> 26:26.793
I found a box.

26:26.876 --> 26:30.088
It contained occult objects.

26:30.171 --> 26:32.299
Talismans, vials of blood.

26:32.924 --> 26:35.927
We think that Connor was involved
in some sort of satanic cult,

26:36.011 --> 26:39.139
-and that's why he was murdered.
-Perhaps I could be of assistance.

26:39.431 --> 26:43.226
Hmm. Do you think you could
bring the items here?

26:46.438 --> 26:48.815
Such a good idea.

27:08.209 --> 27:10.462
-What if she's not at home?
-She's always at home.

27:11.379 --> 27:13.006
Isn't that right, Dezmelda?

27:15.759 --> 27:18.011
We're witches, like you...

27:19.471 --> 27:20.597
and seek counsel.

27:22.557 --> 27:24.476
What made you run, Dezmelda,

27:25.101 --> 27:26.227
from the Dark Lord?

27:26.478 --> 27:29.522
I didn't run from the Dark Lord.

27:30.231 --> 27:32.776
I ran from my High Priest.

27:33.985 --> 27:35.445
I was a child.

27:35.737 --> 27:40.575
We all were. All 14 of us
who took part in the lottery.

27:40.992 --> 27:42.661
Younger than you.

27:43.078 --> 27:46.081
No one questioned why that was.

27:46.164 --> 27:50.585
And I was selected to be queen.

27:51.086 --> 27:52.462
And then...

27:54.714 --> 27:58.009
Her High Priest had a revelation...

27:59.135 --> 28:03.014
delivered unto him
by the Dark Lord, allegedly.

28:03.515 --> 28:05.100
The night before the feast,

28:05.183 --> 28:07.060
the High Priest was to...

28:09.771 --> 28:10.855
initiate her.

28:12.607 --> 28:14.984
I was a child.

28:15.276 --> 28:21.825
Rather than allow herself to be violated,
Dezmelda fled... into the woods.

28:23.159 --> 28:24.994
She's lived here ever since.

28:25.829 --> 28:28.832
What happened then
isn't what Father Blackwood is asking now.

28:28.915 --> 28:30.625
Just listen to your words.

28:31.084 --> 28:35.088
Father Blackwood is asking you
to do this thing, not the Dark Lord.

28:35.171 --> 28:37.132
Father Blackwood is a righteous messenger.

28:37.215 --> 28:38.508
But he isn't divine.

28:38.800 --> 28:42.554
He's flesh and blood,
just like you and me.

28:42.637 --> 28:45.473
Which means he has faults and he sins.

28:45.932 --> 28:48.518
He can be wrong, he can be corrupted.

28:53.481 --> 28:58.027
This part of the forest is where
the Kinkle men have always hunted.

28:58.987 --> 29:01.614
They used to call it Moon Valley.

29:02.490 --> 29:03.575
I'll tell you...

29:04.325 --> 29:07.454
I've seen some strange things out here.

29:17.839 --> 29:19.090
That's a beauty.

29:23.511 --> 29:24.929
It's Harvey's first hunt.

29:25.513 --> 29:27.098
He should do the honors.

29:30.018 --> 29:32.854
Are you suggesting
Father Blackwood is acting on his own,

29:32.937 --> 29:34.189
independent of the Dark Lord?

29:34.272 --> 29:36.232
-I'm saying it's possible.
-But why?

29:37.317 --> 29:39.611
It's clear Dezmelda's High Priest
had an agenda.

29:39.694 --> 29:41.780
But how would my death
serve Father Blackwood?

29:41.863 --> 29:46.159
He's taken care of me, raised me,
treated me like a daughter.

29:46.242 --> 29:48.870
Which makes what he's doing
even more insidious.

29:48.953 --> 29:52.457
He isn't doing anything
except carrying out the Dark Lord's will.

29:52.999 --> 29:56.377
And, Sabrina, I want to be queen.

29:56.669 --> 29:57.962
I've dreamed about it.

29:58.421 --> 29:59.798
Why can't you accept that?

30:01.090 --> 30:03.760
What have you done

30:03.843 --> 30:05.261
No one, I swear.

30:05.345 --> 30:07.347
Go, and never come back.

30:08.890 --> 30:12.352
-Ms. Wardwell, what is it?
-It was a familiar.

30:12.977 --> 30:14.395
Many live in Moon Valley.

30:20.360 --> 30:21.778
Who would do such a thing?

30:23.404 --> 30:24.364
Men.

30:24.948 --> 30:28.618
-Hey Dad, over here!
-Quickly, take the wool yarn.

30:30.453 --> 30:32.497
Form a pentagram around the creature.

30:32.580 --> 30:34.415
Wait, Ms. Wardwell, what are we doing?

30:34.999 --> 30:37.043
Pulling the wool over their eyes.

30:37.377 --> 30:38.336
Don't speak.

30:38.670 --> 30:41.339
Stay very quiet,
or the cloaking won't take.

30:49.889 --> 30:51.182
Blood stops here.

30:52.475 --> 30:54.394
Where the hell is the damn thing?

30:59.566 --> 31:03.653
That was a kill-shot.
It shouldn't even have gotten this far.

31:03.862 --> 31:04.988
What do we do now?

31:06.239 --> 31:08.241
We keep looking. I want that prize.

31:36.227 --> 31:38.021
Once a hunter, always a hunter.

31:38.104 --> 31:39.898
Harvey's not a hunter.

31:39.981 --> 31:43.860
Though you must admit,
he certainly looks the part, Sabrina.

31:43.943 --> 31:45.069
More than looks it.

31:45.612 --> 31:48.114
He is a witch hunter.
His family are witch hunters.

31:48.197 --> 31:49.490
He told you himself.

31:49.574 --> 31:51.910
Then blood demands blood, that is the law.

31:51.993 --> 31:54.787
Blood atonement
for the murder of this familiar.

31:56.039 --> 31:59.125
Perhaps instead of letting you drag me
to the four corners,

31:59.459 --> 32:03.004
my last hours would be better spent
flaying your boyfriend alive.

32:03.087 --> 32:04.672
Rending him limb from limb.

32:04.756 --> 32:07.634
Keep away from him. Harvey's not a killer.

32:07.717 --> 32:09.135
You believe that, Sabrina?

32:09.844 --> 32:11.387
Even with what we just saw?

32:11.721 --> 32:13.932
Yes. Yes.

32:14.349 --> 32:18.519
How is your faith in the mortal boy any
different than my faith in the Dark Lord?

32:19.520 --> 32:21.856
Why is your faith more valid than mine?

32:25.902 --> 32:28.112
Spellman Mortuary, this is Zelda.

32:29.989 --> 32:33.201
Lady Blackwood. Oh, come straight away.

32:35.411 --> 32:38.998
Nana Ruth, this is my friend from school.

32:39.958 --> 32:41.542
Hello, handsome fellow.

32:41.626 --> 32:45.421
Oh... no, Nana. Her name is Susie.

32:45.505 --> 32:46.756
No, it's okay, Roz.

32:48.174 --> 32:51.594
I asked Susie to come with me because--

32:51.678 --> 32:54.973
Because I scared you the last time.

32:56.474 --> 32:57.308
Nana...

32:58.726 --> 33:02.647
how did us Walker women get this...

33:04.232 --> 33:05.191
cunning?

33:05.441 --> 33:06.985
Generations ago...

33:08.486 --> 33:13.157
our kin accused a woman of being a witch.

33:13.825 --> 33:16.077
The other witches in Greendale,

33:16.369 --> 33:20.623
they cursed us Walker women
with blindness.

33:22.208 --> 33:25.253
But witches aren't real, are they, Nana?

33:26.587 --> 33:29.757
And what does being blind have to do
with being cunning?

33:30.842 --> 33:35.054
I don't know if being cursed
gave us the cunning,

33:35.138 --> 33:38.057
or if it simply brought out
what was already there.

33:40.351 --> 33:45.023
But I do know you will lose your vision.

33:46.566 --> 33:48.192
But with the cunning...

33:49.652 --> 33:53.573
you'll be able to see things
that others cannot.

33:54.574 --> 33:58.661
And that will save your life.

34:07.336 --> 34:08.296
Harvey.

34:10.590 --> 34:14.594
I thought this year was gonna be different
with my dad and my grandfather.

34:15.803 --> 34:17.805
Did something happen?

34:18.264 --> 34:20.099
We all went down to Moon Valley to hunt.

34:22.435 --> 34:26.439
There was a deer...
and it was my turn, Grandpa said.

34:28.232 --> 34:29.233
But I...

34:30.735 --> 34:31.652
I couldn't do it.

34:31.736 --> 34:36.074
So Grandpa did it, but I... I should
have stopped him. I didn't stop him.

34:36.157 --> 34:38.159
-I should have stopped him, but I didn't.
-It's okay.

34:38.242 --> 34:39.619
It's hopeless, Sabrina.

34:40.119 --> 34:43.039
Besides Tommy, I don't...
fit in with them.

34:45.917 --> 34:47.085
You're not like them.

34:49.128 --> 34:50.421
Not even close.

34:55.593 --> 34:56.803
You wouldn't hurt a fly.

34:58.971 --> 35:00.181
That's why I love you.

35:07.939 --> 35:11.567
Qui affecto protego, mixtisque iubas

35:11.651 --> 35:15.446
serpentibus et posteris meis stirpiqu.

35:21.410 --> 35:24.330
-Sabrina, thank Beelzebub, I need you.
-For what?

35:24.413 --> 35:26.707
I've got Lady Blackwood downstairs
on the verge of hysteria,

35:26.791 --> 35:28.417
Hilda is at that ridiculous book store,

35:28.501 --> 35:31.420
but I've got a pot of her calming tea
on the stove. Fetch it and come down.

35:31.504 --> 35:33.714
At first, there were cramps,
then I saw blood.

35:33.798 --> 35:36.134
I was spotting. My babies,
are they all right?

35:36.217 --> 35:38.678
Tranquil thoughts,
Lady Blackwood, you're fine.

35:38.761 --> 35:41.722
I can't lose my babies.
Faustus would never forgive me.

35:41.806 --> 35:44.392
-I don't want to fail him.
-Nonsense. Sabrina, pour the tea.

35:44.475 --> 35:47.145
-Already poured, Aunt Zee.
-It's not poison, is it?

35:47.228 --> 35:50.690
Of course not.
It's chamomile with a calming tincture.

35:50.773 --> 35:51.941
Drink up.

35:53.151 --> 35:55.153
Finish every drop, that's a good girl.

35:55.820 --> 35:57.780
What's happening

35:57.864 --> 36:00.658
Your blood pressure is abnormally high.

36:00.741 --> 36:02.493
You're having a panic attack.

36:02.577 --> 36:04.787
Have you done any
intense spellcasting lately?

36:04.871 --> 36:06.789
Sometimes that can stress a pregnancy.

36:06.873 --> 36:09.959
It was dangerous, but I had to do it.

36:11.711 --> 36:13.129
You understand, don't you?

36:16.883 --> 36:19.385
Of course, Lady Blackwood,
I understand you.

36:19.468 --> 36:21.637
You know what they're really like.

36:22.054 --> 36:25.558
Always whispering and...
and plotting and...

36:25.641 --> 36:27.810
and I think they're gonna kill my babies.

36:27.894 --> 36:29.770
No one is going to hurt your babies.

36:29.854 --> 36:33.149
You just have a touch
of third trimester hysteria, nothing more.

36:33.608 --> 36:34.817
Who's plotting?

36:34.901 --> 36:38.946
Those Weird Sisters. Those sluts.

36:41.824 --> 36:45.661
I won't let them conspire against me.
My children will come first.

36:45.745 --> 36:47.997
Why

36:48.080 --> 36:51.375
All three of them,
they think they're so clever.

36:51.959 --> 36:54.170
Planning to take
what belongs to my children.

36:54.503 --> 36:57.798
They would've done anything.
Hurt them, curse them.

36:59.967 --> 37:01.719
So I had to hurt them first.

37:03.846 --> 37:08.517
Kill one, and the others
are no threat of consequence.

37:13.898 --> 37:17.526
What did Lady Blackwood mean by
"her children" come first?

37:18.236 --> 37:22.949
I wonder if Constance might think
Father Blackwood has other children.

37:24.533 --> 37:26.077
He wouldn't be the first High Priest

37:26.160 --> 37:29.330
to have dropped
the odd bastard child here and there.

37:29.413 --> 37:32.833
But how would those other children be
a threat to Lady Blackwood's twins?

37:32.917 --> 37:36.629
Children born of a High Priest,
whether they're legitimate or not,

37:36.712 --> 37:38.798
can lay claim to that title.

37:38.881 --> 37:42.343
So if Father Blackwood
had other children out in the world...

37:43.177 --> 37:45.346
They could all make a play for the seat.

37:53.813 --> 37:56.232
Prudence, I need to talk to you.

37:56.732 --> 37:58.734
I'm being fitted for my Feast Day dress.

37:58.818 --> 38:02.613
It was premature of me to accuse
Father Blackwood of having an agenda

38:02.697 --> 38:04.115
when he choose you as queen.

38:04.615 --> 38:05.783
Finally. You've come--

38:05.866 --> 38:09.578
Instead, I think it might be
Lady Blackwood who wants you dead.

38:09.662 --> 38:11.205
What a blasphemous creature you are.

38:11.289 --> 38:13.916
You said Father Blackwood treats you
like a daughter.

38:14.000 --> 38:16.752
Is it possible you actually are
his daughter?

38:18.879 --> 38:21.757
Because if you were,
Lady Blackwood would see you as a threat.

38:21.841 --> 38:23.843
Have you completely lost your mind?

38:23.926 --> 38:26.470
Maybe. But why does Father Blackwood
take care of you?

38:26.554 --> 38:27.930
Because he's charitable.

38:28.014 --> 38:30.016
If you were Father Blackwood's daughter,

38:30.099 --> 38:32.685
you could one day lay claim
to the Church of Night,

38:32.768 --> 38:34.645
this school, everything,

38:34.979 --> 38:37.982
but you'd have to get rid
of his legitimate heirs first.

38:38.065 --> 38:39.942
Stop this. Please, stop this.

38:40.026 --> 38:43.571
If Lady Blackwood had it out for you,
wouldn't it be convenient for her

38:43.654 --> 38:45.948
if you were sacrificed
at the Feast of Feasts?

38:46.032 --> 38:47.283
For the last time...

38:48.034 --> 38:50.953
it is the Dark Lord's will
that I am to be queen.

38:51.037 --> 38:53.372
What if it's the will of a witch?

38:53.456 --> 38:58.627
Of a pregnant witch with a grudge
against you and your sisters?

38:59.670 --> 39:01.714
I just left her at my house.

39:01.797 --> 39:05.051
She was ranting about
how you're plotting against her,

39:05.134 --> 39:08.679
and how she needed to hurt you
before you could hurt her.

39:08.763 --> 39:10.473
Do you have even a shred of proof?

39:10.806 --> 39:13.309
Besides Lady Blackwood's
hysterical ramblings?

39:13.601 --> 39:16.562
No... just a hunch.

39:19.607 --> 39:23.277
But Lady Blackwood was holding
the lottery box.

39:24.362 --> 39:27.531
Please, Prudence,
I know you have complete faith

39:27.615 --> 39:29.533
that this is all the Dark Lord's will,

39:29.617 --> 39:32.036
and everything is going
according to his plan...

39:32.995 --> 39:36.540
but if there's even
a shadow of doubt in your mind,

39:36.624 --> 39:38.084
don't you want to know the truth?

39:38.709 --> 39:41.504
She'd be murdering you
in front of the entire coven.

39:47.385 --> 39:52.431
If I were to...
entertain this fantasy of yours...

39:55.351 --> 39:57.478
how do you suggest we proceed, handmaiden?

40:00.356 --> 40:03.359
Every Queen of the Feast
deserves a last supper, right?

40:27.716 --> 40:28.759
Dorothea?

40:33.347 --> 40:34.390
Susie!

40:35.224 --> 40:36.267
Dinner's ready!

40:43.607 --> 40:45.109
This happens every year.

40:45.192 --> 40:47.862
They start drinking before breakfast
and pass out before lunch.

40:47.945 --> 40:49.113
So it's just you and me.

40:49.989 --> 40:50.948
I'm okay with that.

40:52.032 --> 40:53.659
Happy Thanksgiving, Tommy.

40:54.910 --> 40:56.245
Happy Thanksgiving, nerd.

40:58.038 --> 41:00.749
Father Blackwood, Lady Blackwood,
please, come in.

41:01.333 --> 41:04.086
Happy Thanks... um... Feast of Feasts.

41:04.170 --> 41:05.671
Blessed Feast.

41:06.255 --> 41:08.924
We'll be dining in the parlor
this evening.

41:10.718 --> 41:11.802
Wow!

41:11.886 --> 41:15.723
Prudence, you look stunning.
You must be filled with such--

41:15.806 --> 41:18.058
I'm filled with ecstasy,
Lady Blackwood, yes.

41:18.893 --> 41:20.102
Shall we eat?

41:21.395 --> 41:22.438
If I may.

41:27.943 --> 41:31.197
Thank you to Queen Prudence
for the sacrifice she makes tonight...

41:31.906 --> 41:33.115
for the coven.

41:36.744 --> 41:38.871
And where is your sister Hilda?

41:39.163 --> 41:41.290
Given her disenfranchised status,

41:41.373 --> 41:44.043
I didn't think it was appropriate
for her to join us.

41:44.126 --> 41:46.128
Also, she's making dessert.

41:55.012 --> 41:56.931
Quiet feast for us, Stolas.

41:57.681 --> 42:00.017
Mmm!

42:00.684 --> 42:02.811
That'll be the takeaway I ordered.

42:03.896 --> 42:07.191
If you're nice, I'll... share.

42:17.660 --> 42:21.080
My... that looks like a heavy pizza.

42:21.872 --> 42:24.833
Would you mind setting it
over there for me?

42:27.086 --> 42:29.380
I'm so glad you're here.

42:30.089 --> 42:32.091
I can't tell you how starved I am.

42:33.175 --> 42:34.343
Famished.

42:41.642 --> 42:43.769
-Aunt Hilda, you've outdone yourself.

42:43.852 --> 42:46.063
I hope so. This is my mom's secret recipe

42:46.146 --> 42:48.357
when she thought
my dad was having an affair.

42:48.607 --> 42:51.610
-How long will it take to work?
-Uh, should be instantaneous.

42:57.408 --> 43:00.202
And now, for the pièce de résistance,

43:00.786 --> 43:04.582
my Aunt Hilda's brown butter
marchpane cake with brandied currants.

43:05.040 --> 43:07.084
Mmm, looks delicious...

43:07.751 --> 43:10.796
but I want to save room for later.

43:12.256 --> 43:16.051
Nonsense, Lady Blackwood.
You're eating for three, remember?

43:16.885 --> 43:17.803
Faustus?

43:21.599 --> 43:25.311
When can one be gluttonous,
if not on the Feast of Feasts?

43:26.103 --> 43:27.479
Oh, I agree.

43:29.440 --> 43:30.399
Heartily.

43:41.285 --> 43:44.163
As a recent convert,
Father Blackwood, I'm curious,

43:44.246 --> 43:47.791
why did you decide to reinstate
Feast Day after my father outlawed it?

43:49.001 --> 43:52.254
When I became High Priest
after Edward died,

43:53.047 --> 43:54.423
the Dark Lord revealed

43:54.965 --> 43:58.927
that I must return
to our centuries-old traditions.

44:00.971 --> 44:03.891
Sometimes, the old ways are best.

44:05.225 --> 44:06.894
What a divine revelation.

44:08.771 --> 44:11.565
Are you enjoying this year's Feast Day,
Lady Blackwood?

44:12.524 --> 44:14.902
Oh, I'm thrilled by it.

44:15.778 --> 44:16.612
Well...

44:17.655 --> 44:20.491
I hope you're satisfied
with your last supper, Prudence.

44:20.574 --> 44:23.118
We'll all miss you
when you're gone, won't we?

44:23.535 --> 44:24.870
In body and soul.

44:25.621 --> 44:26.622
Mostly body.

44:26.705 --> 44:28.332
I'll miss you so much.

44:28.874 --> 44:29.917
Me, too.

44:30.125 --> 44:31.335
I won't.

44:35.964 --> 44:37.216
And why is that?

44:37.299 --> 44:39.718
You're a stain
and we're better off without you.

44:42.388 --> 44:45.349
Constance, Prudence is our queen.

44:45.432 --> 44:48.644
No, she's not my queen, she's a bastard.

44:49.269 --> 44:50.104
Oh.

44:53.565 --> 44:56.652
When was the last time you cast a spell,
Lady Blackwood?

44:56.735 --> 44:58.320
The night of Feast Day lottery.

45:00.531 --> 45:02.116
And what spell did you cast?

45:02.199 --> 45:05.619
I enchanted the ballot box
to favor Prudence as queen.

45:07.830 --> 45:09.248
Why would you do that?

45:12.334 --> 45:14.878
Because she and her slut sisters
are your seed.

45:15.713 --> 45:18.632
Because you are
a voracious slut yourself...

45:21.427 --> 45:23.011
and that means trouble for my children.

45:25.472 --> 45:26.849
I'm so sorry, husband.

45:26.932 --> 45:31.395
I'm not sure
why I'm unburdening myself like this.

45:31.812 --> 45:37.025
It's because your queen requested
a special cake for her last supper.

45:39.695 --> 45:41.029
Aunt Hilda's truth cake.

45:42.281 --> 45:44.283
One bite and you cannot lie.

45:49.955 --> 45:54.126
Constance, how dare you interfere
with the Dark Lord's will.

45:54.585 --> 45:56.503
Have you any idea the scandal,

45:57.045 --> 45:59.506
the blasphemy you've brought
upon the church?

46:02.342 --> 46:03.469
I'm sorry.

46:06.054 --> 46:07.806
Are you my father, then?

46:15.439 --> 46:16.440
I am.

46:18.025 --> 46:19.109
And my mother?

46:19.526 --> 46:20.527
Dead.

46:20.861 --> 46:22.654
-By your hand?
-Sabrina.

46:23.655 --> 46:24.782
Indirectly.

46:30.662 --> 46:33.332
She threw herself in a river

46:34.291 --> 46:36.919
because I would not marry her.

46:40.130 --> 46:40.964
I see.

46:42.549 --> 46:44.301
Are we your daughters, too?

46:45.260 --> 46:46.178
Hmm?

46:46.637 --> 46:48.222
No, you're just orphans.

46:51.975 --> 46:53.060
Prudence?

46:54.520 --> 46:56.438
So you were right, Sabrina.

46:56.855 --> 46:59.316
The Dark Lord doesn't want me
to be his queen.

47:00.317 --> 47:01.485
The coven...

47:01.944 --> 47:03.654
The coven must meet straight away.

47:04.988 --> 47:06.865
To redraw for a new queen.

47:07.407 --> 47:12.204
Or... the Dark Lord could come
to you with a new revelation.

47:12.621 --> 47:16.083
One that compels you to outlaw the feast.

47:17.000 --> 47:20.003
This year and every year to come.

47:21.755 --> 47:24.383
And what's been revealed
at this table tonight...

47:25.592 --> 47:27.302
will never be spoken of again.

47:29.096 --> 47:33.016
Whatever happens...
I want to wear the dress...

47:35.310 --> 47:37.980
and... and sit on the throne of skulls.

47:40.065 --> 47:43.193
Can I, please... Father?

48:10.596 --> 48:12.681
I've been fasting for days.

48:21.523 --> 48:25.235
Brethren, sisters,
a very unholy night to you all.

48:25.736 --> 48:27.571
And also to you.

48:27.905 --> 48:31.491
Each year,
the Feast of Feasts commemorates

48:31.575 --> 48:34.620
the selfless sacrifice
that saved our coven.

48:35.203 --> 48:40.375
Praise Freya! Praise Freya!
Praise Freya!

48:41.418 --> 48:42.794
However...

48:44.880 --> 48:49.426
...tonight, I must be
the reluctant bearer of dark tidings.

48:50.802 --> 48:52.721
In an unexpected turn of events,

48:52.804 --> 48:57.100
through circumstances
entirely out of our control...

49:01.980 --> 49:03.523
Prudence Night...

49:05.150 --> 49:07.986
cannot fulfill her duty
as Queen of the Feast.

49:14.993 --> 49:16.119
Blasphemy!

49:16.203 --> 49:17.746
We're ravenous.

49:17.829 --> 49:18.956
We must feast!

49:20.415 --> 49:22.250
Moreover! Moreover!

49:22.626 --> 49:24.753
The Dark Lord has revealed to me...

49:28.632 --> 49:29.675
that this year...

49:30.425 --> 49:31.259
there...

49:33.345 --> 49:35.722
shall not be...

49:38.850 --> 49:41.186
Freya lives! Praise Satan!

50:10.382 --> 50:13.927
All Hail, Mildred! Queen of the Feast!

50:14.386 --> 50:15.971
Hail Mildred!

50:16.054 --> 50:17.806
Queen of the Feast!

50:59.473 --> 51:01.016
-What's happened?

51:01.433 --> 51:04.102
Uh, that was the coroner's office.

51:05.228 --> 51:08.148
They're bringing over
a couple of bodies.

51:09.107 --> 51:10.067
A couple.

51:10.150 --> 51:13.737
Uh... It's... suicides.

51:13.820 --> 51:15.197
Always happens this time of year.

51:15.280 --> 51:17.741
Mortals can be so morose
during the holidays.

51:18.325 --> 51:19.868
It's Mr. and Mrs. Kemper.

51:32.881 --> 51:33.965
Aunt Zelda?

51:34.716 --> 51:36.259
Yes, Sabrina?

51:36.760 --> 51:40.680
What would have happened if it was me
who was selected queen and not Prudence?

51:42.224 --> 51:44.643
Would you have let them do to me
what was done to Mildred?

51:46.269 --> 51:47.104
Never.

51:48.688 --> 51:50.732
But if it was the Dark Lord's will?

51:54.444 --> 51:57.614
It wouldn't have mattered.
Now please, Sabrina. I'm tired.

52:09.876 --> 52:10.961
Hey, Nerd.

52:11.044 --> 52:13.964
You know what the best thing about working
the Friday after Thanksgiving is?

52:14.047 --> 52:15.173
Getting out of the house?

52:16.133 --> 52:17.342
Time-and-a-half pay.

52:27.602 --> 52:28.645
Sisters.

52:30.730 --> 52:31.773
What are you doing?

52:32.607 --> 52:33.567
Praying.

52:34.067 --> 52:36.653
-Thanking the Dark Lord...
-That you're still with us.

52:47.873 --> 52:49.833
Agatha, shouldn't we have invited her?

52:51.334 --> 52:52.335
No, Dorcas.

52:53.378 --> 52:55.005
Better to leave her out of this.

53:07.267 --> 53:09.978
Blood demands blood.

53:25.952 --> 53:29.539
Let sticks and stones break
the witch hunters' bones.

54:35.272 --> 54:36.690
Brett, move your head.
