02:49.544 --> 02:51.837
Miss Eady.
Mr. Christie.

02:52.338 --> 02:54.423
Come in. Do.

03:00.763 --> 03:03.432
Blessed blackout.

03:12.859 --> 03:14.985
Well, we'll have a nice
little cup of tea first.

03:15.069 --> 03:16.862
Come in the kitchen.
It's cozier in there.

03:16.946 --> 03:18.780
Oh, that would be lovely.

03:31.878 --> 03:33.128
Well.

03:33.213 --> 03:36.506
I've, uh,
I've only just brewed it up.

03:36.591 --> 03:39.092
Mrs. Christie's out,
is she?

03:39.177 --> 03:44.264
Uh, she's, uh, she's away
up in Sheffield at her sister's.

03:44.349 --> 03:45.807
Oh, sit down,
Miss Eady. Do.

03:45.892 --> 03:48.185
Thank you.

03:48.269 --> 03:51.897
Do, you, uh,
do you take sugar?

03:51.981 --> 03:53.232
No, thanks.

03:53.316 --> 03:54.233
No.

03:54.317 --> 03:55.359
Thank you.

03:55.443 --> 03:56.568
Well, now...

03:56.653 --> 03:59.488
It's, uh, been bad,
has it ‒

03:59.572 --> 04:00.906
the bronchitis?

04:00.990 --> 04:03.116
At nights.
It's been bad at nights.

04:03.201 --> 04:09.581
Mm-hmm.
It keeps you awake, I daresay.

04:09.666 --> 04:10.916
Yes.

04:11.000 --> 04:14.211
Well, this is the stuff
for you, Muriel.

04:14.295 --> 04:17.755
You don't mind if I call you
Muriel, do you?

04:17.839 --> 04:19.841
No. It's very good of you
to go to all this trouble.

04:19.926 --> 04:21.176
Oh, not at all.

04:21.261 --> 04:26.807
All my doctor does
is keep giving me
this cough mixture.

04:26.891 --> 04:30.435
Well...not many of them
know about this stuff.

04:30.520 --> 04:33.438
Oh! It smells just like
friar's balsam.

04:34.023 --> 04:36.733
Uh, well, yes,
that's in it.

04:36.818 --> 04:39.820
It's a mixture ‒
what we call a compound.

04:39.904 --> 04:43.615
Now, here's the little mask
that goes over your face.

04:43.700 --> 04:45.575
Have you finished
with your tea?

04:45.660 --> 04:49.037
Yes, thank you.
Fine.

04:49.122 --> 04:51.707
Um, when it's over
your face,

04:51.791 --> 04:53.709
you must breathe deeply

04:53.793 --> 04:56.086
so you take in
all the vapors, you see?

04:56.170 --> 05:00.048
You may feel...
just a bit dizzy.

05:00.133 --> 05:02.301
What's that for?

05:02.385 --> 05:04.636
Uh, that's the extractor.

05:04.721 --> 05:09.224
It gets rid of what we call
all the waste products.

05:09.309 --> 05:13.312
Now then...you put the mask
over your face.

05:13.396 --> 05:15.272
Lean your head back.

05:15.356 --> 05:17.149
Lean it right back.

05:17.233 --> 05:19.901
Shut your eyes.
Close your eyes.

05:19.986 --> 05:21.653
That's it. Shut your eyes.

05:21.738 --> 05:24.614
Now then,
start your breathing, then.

05:24.699 --> 05:26.867
Breathe quite deeply.

05:26.951 --> 05:29.828
Breathe. Breathe.

05:29.912 --> 05:33.582
It smells a bit funny,
Mr. Christie.

05:33.666 --> 05:36.084
Do you feel
a bit dizzy?

05:36.169 --> 05:38.170
I do, a bit.

05:38.254 --> 05:41.423
Yes, well, that's all
the goodness taking effect.

05:41.507 --> 05:42.549
Breathe, Muriel.

05:42.633 --> 05:44.009
Breathe.

05:44.093 --> 05:45.010
Oh!

05:45.094 --> 05:46.845
Uhh! Uhh! Uhh!

05:46.929 --> 05:48.096
No, Muriel!

05:48.181 --> 05:49.348
Muriel, no!

05:49.432 --> 05:50.891
Breathe, Muriel!

05:52.268 --> 05:53.393
No. No. No.

05:53.478 --> 05:54.436
Aaah! Aaah!

05:54.520 --> 05:55.687
No. No.

05:55.772 --> 05:57.064
Aaah. Aaah.

05:57.148 --> 06:00.567
Breathe. Breathe.
Breathe.

06:00.651 --> 06:02.944
Breathe.

06:03.029 --> 06:05.280
Breathe.

06:11.287 --> 06:14.956
M-Muriel...

06:17.293 --> 06:21.963
Muriel...

06:25.802 --> 06:27.386
Muriel...

06:51.244 --> 06:56.498
Oh...Muriel...

06:56.582 --> 06:58.542
Muriel...

06:58.626 --> 07:00.544
Muriel...

07:00.628 --> 07:02.671
Muriel...

08:41.312 --> 08:43.855
Ring the old bell, then,
shall we?

08:48.653 --> 08:51.363
It's not a bad district,
is it?

08:51.447 --> 08:53.031
It's not bad.

08:55.493 --> 08:57.619
Come on, come on.

08:59.622 --> 09:00.956
Yes?

09:01.040 --> 09:03.041
We've, uh ‒

09:03.125 --> 09:05.669
Um, we've, um, come about
the flat.

09:05.753 --> 09:07.170
To see it?

09:07.255 --> 09:09.756
We just want
to look it over ‒

09:09.840 --> 09:12.467
You know,
see if it's suitable.

09:14.470 --> 09:16.805
Yes, well, you
better come in.

09:25.648 --> 09:28.608
Oh, that's my wife,
Mrs. Christie.

09:28.693 --> 09:31.236
They've come
about the flat.

09:31.320 --> 09:32.988
I'll lead the way.

09:38.828 --> 09:40.704
I'll look after him.

09:42.915 --> 09:45.458
The baby ‒ while you're
looking at the flat,

09:45.543 --> 09:47.544
I'll hold him.

09:51.173 --> 09:54.843
He'll be all right with me.
What's his name?

09:54.927 --> 09:56.303
Geraldine.

09:56.387 --> 09:58.263
"She," I should say.

09:58.347 --> 09:59.639
Yes.

10:03.894 --> 10:06.771
Mr. Kitchener occupies
this floor.

10:06.856 --> 10:09.858
It's up one more.

10:21.537 --> 10:24.748
Just the two rooms,
is it?
Uh, yes.

10:24.832 --> 10:27.292
Well, it's not what we're
used to, you understand?

10:27.376 --> 10:29.461
We used to have
this mansion flat

10:29.545 --> 10:30.837
overlooking the river,

10:30.921 --> 10:32.797
but, uh,
we had to move out.

10:32.882 --> 10:35.091
Tim ‒
Oh, gas, is it?

10:35.176 --> 10:37.844
Yes, it works out
less of an expense.

10:37.928 --> 10:39.387
That's what we find.

10:39.472 --> 10:42.515
Oh, we're not too worried
about the money.

10:42.600 --> 10:44.643
The job I do,
we don't have to.

10:44.727 --> 10:46.019
Oh, we'll take it.

10:46.103 --> 10:48.480
Oh, Tim,
I don't know.

10:48.564 --> 10:50.732
Do we get use
of the garden?

10:50.816 --> 10:52.025
No.

10:52.109 --> 10:54.319
I mean, just to put
the baby out.

10:54.403 --> 10:56.905
Well, I'd like
to help you, but, uh...

10:58.574 --> 11:00.241
...it's a question
of the lease.

11:00.326 --> 11:02.202
Once you surrender
the right of way,

11:02.286 --> 11:04.454
I mean, it can take
an act of Parliament ‒

11:04.538 --> 11:06.206
these cases.

11:06.290 --> 11:08.958
Oh, Tim,
I don't know.

11:09.043 --> 11:11.711
There is another couple,
very keen...

11:13.214 --> 11:15.256
Irish, as a matter of fact.

11:15.341 --> 11:18.093
No, we'll take it.

11:18.177 --> 11:21.805
Well, you're doing
the right thing.

11:26.435 --> 11:27.394
Right.

11:27.478 --> 11:30.146
Now, are you and Teddy going
to have a nice sleep?

11:30.231 --> 11:32.440
There's a good girl.

11:33.818 --> 11:36.361
Now, you have
a nice sleep.

12:06.892 --> 12:08.059
Oh...

12:08.144 --> 12:09.936
Mr. Christie.

12:10.020 --> 12:12.021
I thought you
might like...

12:12.106 --> 12:13.398
You did make me jump.

12:13.482 --> 12:15.066
...a little cup
of tea.

12:15.151 --> 12:17.777
Well, I've just had one,
actually.

12:17.862 --> 12:19.654
Well, that's all right.

12:21.323 --> 12:23.324
Thank you.

12:37.423 --> 12:40.258
It's... nice up here now.

12:41.677 --> 12:45.472
Yes. It's not bad, is it?

12:45.556 --> 12:49.559
I was in the police
during the war, you know.

12:49.643 --> 12:51.603
Were you?

12:51.687 --> 12:55.982
We had a lot to do
with medical stuff then.

12:56.066 --> 12:57.609
Consulting.

12:57.693 --> 13:01.362
I'm always on hand
for advice, Beryl,

13:01.447 --> 13:03.531
if...you ‒

13:06.660 --> 13:09.662
Has Beryl gone out,
Mrs. Christie?

13:09.747 --> 13:12.499
I don't know. I'll go up.

13:12.583 --> 13:15.001
Beryl! It's me!

13:22.802 --> 13:26.471
Oh. I was looking
for Beryl.

13:26.555 --> 13:28.306
She's, uh...

13:30.309 --> 13:32.644
Oh, I thought
it would be you, Alice.

13:32.728 --> 13:34.771
I got you
all the stuff for tea.

13:34.855 --> 13:35.772
Oh, thank you.

13:35.856 --> 13:37.982
Alice, this is, uh ‒

13:43.656 --> 13:45.156
Who was that?

13:45.241 --> 13:48.827
That was, um,
the ground floor.

14:01.257 --> 14:03.424
Am I late?

14:10.933 --> 14:14.352
My tummy's been playing
me up again today.

14:14.436 --> 14:16.688
Oh, Reg.

14:41.547 --> 14:42.714
Tim. Tim.

14:42.798 --> 14:46.843
Might I, um,
might I have a word?

14:46.927 --> 14:48.511
Mr. Christie, why, sure.

14:48.596 --> 14:50.430
There was a gentleman
at the door for you today.

14:50.514 --> 14:51.890
He, uh, left this.

14:56.270 --> 14:59.564
Uh, what's it say,
Mr. Christie?

14:59.648 --> 15:01.065
Oh, yes, I forgot.

15:01.150 --> 15:04.611
Uh, well, there's no need
to read it, anyway.

15:04.695 --> 15:08.239
It's, uh, about the payments
on your furniture.

15:08.324 --> 15:11.367
You're 6 weeks in arrears,
apparently.

15:11.452 --> 15:14.621
Not paid, you mean?

15:14.705 --> 15:15.955
No.

15:16.040 --> 15:19.667
I didn't mention it to, uh,
Beryl, worry her with that.

15:19.752 --> 15:22.420
Well, she has the money,
Mr. Christie.

15:22.504 --> 15:23.963
She has it every week.

15:24.048 --> 15:27.091
I gave him 10 shillings
out of my own pocket.

15:27.176 --> 15:29.135
I don't want this house
getting a name, Tim.

15:29.219 --> 15:31.554
Oh, that damn girl!

15:31.639 --> 15:33.765
Don't you worry,
Mr. Christie.

15:33.849 --> 15:35.558
You'll get that money back.

15:35.643 --> 15:39.103
I'll be getting a new job
shortly, I shouldn't wonder.

15:39.188 --> 15:41.481
They've asked me if I want
to train as a manager ‒

15:41.565 --> 15:46.152
or as a managing director...
um, or something, you know.

15:46.236 --> 15:47.487
Yes.

15:47.571 --> 15:50.448
Won't you have to learn
to read and write for that?

15:50.532 --> 15:51.866
Oh, no, no, no.

15:51.951 --> 15:55.578
You have, uh, secretaries ‒
things like that, see?

15:57.414 --> 16:01.250
Yes. Well, as long as I get
my 10 shillings back.

16:01.335 --> 16:03.294
Oh, that damn woman.

16:03.379 --> 16:07.423
Oh, and, Tim, there was,
uh, a young girl

16:07.508 --> 16:09.384
in and out of here
all day.

16:09.468 --> 16:13.054
Oh, I'm sorry, Mr. Christie.

16:15.808 --> 16:18.309
What's the matter?

16:21.438 --> 16:22.647
Oh, hello.

16:22.731 --> 16:24.691
Hello, little one.

16:24.775 --> 16:28.236
What you been doing
today? Hmm?

16:29.822 --> 16:30.989
Where's Beryl?

16:31.073 --> 16:33.116
She's having a bit
of a lie-down.

16:33.200 --> 16:34.993
She's not feeling
too grand.

16:42.751 --> 16:44.961
What's all this, then?

16:45.045 --> 16:46.587
I'm all right.

16:46.672 --> 16:49.674
I'm just having
a lie-down.

16:49.758 --> 16:53.553
What's all this about
the furniture money, then?

16:53.637 --> 16:55.680
The what?

16:55.764 --> 16:59.183
You know bloody well what,
so give me all that!

16:59.268 --> 17:00.518
The man was here.

17:00.602 --> 17:02.520
Six weeks,
it hasn't been paid.

17:02.604 --> 17:04.605
And I slaved my guts out
for that money, my girl.

17:04.690 --> 17:08.901
So do I.
4 pounds 10 a week to feed you,

17:08.986 --> 17:11.319
pay the rent,
handle the installments,

17:11.405 --> 17:13.531
and buy everything
for the baby...

17:13.615 --> 17:15.450
and another one
on the way.

17:21.290 --> 17:24.500
Yes, that's right ‒
Another one on the way.

17:24.585 --> 17:27.502
We ‒ We can't have
another kid yet.

17:27.588 --> 17:30.590
Well, that's exactly what
we're going to get...

17:30.674 --> 17:32.842
unless I do something
about it.

17:34.970 --> 17:38.264
"Do something"?

17:38.348 --> 17:40.433
Do what?

17:40.517 --> 17:42.226
Oh, never mind what.

17:42.311 --> 17:44.771
She wants to go
to bed now.

17:44.855 --> 17:46.064
Do what?!

17:46.148 --> 17:48.775
Tim, there are things
you can do.

17:48.859 --> 17:50.568
Oh, no, you don't,
my lady.

17:50.652 --> 17:52.612
Well, it's my choice,
isn't it?

17:52.696 --> 17:55.281
Anyway, I've done it.
I've taken some pills.

17:55.365 --> 17:57.658
What do you think
I'm lying here for?

17:57.743 --> 18:00.578
You didn't even ask me!
You didn't even tell me!

18:00.662 --> 18:03.247
Ask you?! Do I have to ask
your permission?!

18:03.332 --> 18:06.084
Yes, you bloody do!
Does she know about this?!

18:06.168 --> 18:07.502
Leave Alice out of this!

18:07.586 --> 18:09.921
You knew about this, didn't you?!
No.

18:10.005 --> 18:11.214
Leave Alice alone!

18:11.298 --> 18:13.424
She's staying here the night
to look after me!

18:13.509 --> 18:15.093
No, she's not!
I know her sort!

18:15.177 --> 18:16.552
What's that
meant to mean?!

18:16.637 --> 18:17.887
Never you mind!

18:19.306 --> 18:20.890
Now look
what you've done!

18:20.974 --> 18:22.767
Get out
and leave Alice alone!

18:22.851 --> 18:25.061
I wouldn't touch her
with a barge pole!

18:25.145 --> 18:26.270
I better go.

18:26.355 --> 18:28.314
No! He can sleep
in the kitchen!

18:28.398 --> 18:30.066
I'm not sleeping
anywhere!

18:30.150 --> 18:32.068
I'm not coming back!
Good!

18:32.152 --> 18:33.903
Bloody old cow!

18:35.280 --> 18:36.781
I'm not the sort of man

18:36.865 --> 18:38.991
who can make due
with just one woman.

18:39.076 --> 18:40.118
No? Go on!

18:40.202 --> 18:42.078
No, it's in the family,
see?

18:42.162 --> 18:43.579
Take my brother.

18:43.664 --> 18:46.165
He's paying out hundreds a year
in alimony.

18:46.250 --> 18:47.416
Well, thousands.

18:47.501 --> 18:49.836
Mind you, I'm fly.

18:49.920 --> 18:52.046
What do you think I've got
waiting for me when I get home?

18:52.131 --> 18:53.172
The rent collector?

18:54.341 --> 18:55.716
"Rent collector" ‒

18:55.801 --> 18:58.678
He's a bit of a humorist,
our Wally.

18:58.762 --> 19:00.721
Tucked up nice and warm
in bed with the wife.

19:00.806 --> 19:02.765
That's what I said ‒
the rent collector.

19:02.850 --> 19:04.267
I'll hit you
in a minute!

19:04.351 --> 19:05.560
Go it, Taffy.

19:07.646 --> 19:09.730
No, there's
two of them, see?

19:09.815 --> 19:13.484
There's Beryl and this other
little dark one ‒ Alice ‒

19:13.569 --> 19:16.904
just lying there waiting for it,
crying out for it.

19:16.989 --> 19:19.323
Three in a bed, eh?
How about that?

19:19.408 --> 19:21.993
You can have
my old woman if you like.

19:22.077 --> 19:23.995
That will make up
the set.

19:25.330 --> 19:26.622
Thanks very much.

19:26.707 --> 19:28.958
I'll take you up on that
one day.

19:29.042 --> 19:32.003
Oh, well, if you're traveling
around like me,

19:32.087 --> 19:34.505
you know, it's, uh,
Brighton one day

19:34.590 --> 19:36.132
and Birmingham the next.

19:36.216 --> 19:38.259
You usually manage
to pick up a bit on the way.

19:38.343 --> 19:42.138
That's not all you pick up
if you go on like that.

19:42.222 --> 19:43.431
Oh, no, no, no.

19:43.515 --> 19:45.600
These aren't scrubbers
like you might get, man.

19:45.684 --> 19:48.519
These is ladies ‒
rich ladies.

19:48.604 --> 19:49.729
You know, get bored ‒

19:49.813 --> 19:52.023
They're wanting
a bit of fun.

19:52.107 --> 19:56.360
Elegant,
but, uh, passionate.

19:56.445 --> 19:57.778
Whoa!
Whoa!
Whoa!

20:09.666 --> 20:11.250
Come on, you ‒ Out.
Out.

20:11.335 --> 20:12.710
Beryl wants me
here.

20:12.794 --> 20:14.212
She may need me
here.

20:14.296 --> 20:15.838
I don't bloody need
you here,

20:15.923 --> 20:17.048
and it's my bed!

20:17.132 --> 20:18.674
Don't wake her.
She's tired.

20:18.759 --> 20:20.009
I'm tired, too!

20:20.093 --> 20:22.053
I'm tired
of having you around,

20:22.137 --> 20:23.221
so get out!

20:23.305 --> 20:25.097
And you leave us
in peace!

20:26.516 --> 20:27.767
You, get back in bed!

20:27.851 --> 20:30.269
Just for tonight.
She may not be well.

20:30.354 --> 20:31.771
Whose fault is that?!

20:31.855 --> 20:33.064
Be quiet!

20:33.148 --> 20:34.398
Come on ‒ Out!

20:34.483 --> 20:35.566
Let go of her!

20:35.651 --> 20:37.568
Take your hands
off me!

20:37.653 --> 20:38.986
Don't you touch me!

20:41.156 --> 20:42.740
What is it, Reg?

20:42.824 --> 20:45.368
That's the Evanses
again.

20:51.166 --> 20:52.333
Aaah!

20:56.797 --> 20:59.423
You bloody touch me again!
I'm throwing her out!

20:59.508 --> 21:00.800
Don't be so bloody silly!

21:00.884 --> 21:02.051
It's my bloody house!

21:02.135 --> 21:04.262
I've got rights
in my own bloody house!

21:04.346 --> 21:08.182
Now then, now then,
now then.

21:13.730 --> 21:15.022
What's all this about?

21:15.107 --> 21:16.816
It's all her,
Mr. Christie!

21:16.900 --> 21:18.192
You just calm down.

21:18.277 --> 21:20.903
It's because I've got Alice
staying here a night.

21:20.988 --> 21:22.321
In my bloody bed!

21:22.406 --> 21:24.949
And I'm meant to stay
on the floor in the kitchen!

21:25.033 --> 21:26.284
All right, all right.

21:26.368 --> 21:28.244
There's no need
for language.

21:28.328 --> 21:30.579
This is an apartment
for two persons.

21:30.664 --> 21:32.623
That's quite clear
in the lease.

21:32.708 --> 21:33.791
What lease?

21:33.875 --> 21:35.418
The statutory
regulations.

21:35.502 --> 21:38.421
Alice is just staying with me
because I'm not well.

21:38.505 --> 21:41.132
Never mind about that.
I know the law.

21:41.216 --> 21:42.466
Now then...

21:42.551 --> 21:44.802
you can't be guaranteed
security of tenure

21:44.886 --> 21:46.304
if you're overcrowded.

21:46.388 --> 21:47.763
That is a regulation.

21:47.848 --> 21:49.265
That's right, my girl.

21:49.349 --> 21:52.310
You put your shoes on
and go about your business.

21:52.394 --> 21:53.477
Why should she?!

21:53.562 --> 21:55.229
It's all right.
I'll go.

21:55.314 --> 21:59.483
Any more of this sort
of behavior,

21:59.568 --> 22:03.362
and out you go ‒
both of you.

22:07.993 --> 22:10.619
I just want a bit
of peace, Mr. Christie.

22:10.704 --> 22:12.330
All right, then.

22:12.414 --> 22:13.664
Beryl...

22:13.749 --> 22:16.125
Beryl,
if you're not well,

22:16.209 --> 22:20.296
you shouldn't be larking around
at this time of night.

22:20.380 --> 22:22.256
You should see a doctor.

22:35.520 --> 22:40.316
Lovely day today,
Mr. Christie, ain't it?

22:40.400 --> 22:42.360
Very nice. Yes.

23:25.153 --> 23:26.529
Oh, hello, Beryl.

23:26.613 --> 23:27.988
How are you today?

23:28.073 --> 23:31.033
Oh, I'm fine.
Thank you, Mr. Christie.

23:31.118 --> 23:33.911
Have you been to see
the doctor yet?

23:33.995 --> 23:35.246
The doctor?

23:35.330 --> 23:38.416
Oh, uh, no.

23:38.500 --> 23:39.750
Hmm.

23:39.835 --> 23:42.336
Well, won't you come in
a minute?
Well, I've got the ‒

23:42.421 --> 23:44.797
I've just put
the kettle on.

23:44.881 --> 23:46.841
Oh.

23:56.726 --> 24:01.522
Well, sit down, Beryl.
Do. In the deck chair.

24:07.320 --> 24:13.534
Now, what is all this trouble
between you and Tim?

24:13.618 --> 24:16.245
And don't try and tell me
there isn't any trouble.

24:16.329 --> 24:18.622
No.

24:18.707 --> 24:22.293
You're very young,
you know.

24:22.377 --> 24:24.295
Unexperienced.

24:24.379 --> 24:29.800
Things which may seem
great problems to you

24:29.885 --> 24:35.306
may seem simpler to
an older head, you know?

24:35.390 --> 24:40.227
Well, it's just that I'm ‒
I'm going to have a baby.

24:42.522 --> 24:44.565
Yes, I see.

24:44.649 --> 24:49.528
Tim, I suppose,
is none too keen...

24:49.613 --> 24:54.700
on this, uh,
addition to the family.

24:54.784 --> 24:58.746
No. Well, I'm not,
either.

24:58.830 --> 25:03.292
I-I took some pills
yesterday.

25:05.295 --> 25:06.545
Pills?

25:06.630 --> 25:09.381
Yes, they ‒
They didn't work, though.

25:10.926 --> 25:13.886
You see, Mr. Christie, Tim
only gets 7 pounds a week.

25:13.970 --> 25:18.432
Well...we can't afford
another baby now.

25:20.852 --> 25:23.437
No. I understand that.

25:23.522 --> 25:25.856
I, uh...

25:25.941 --> 25:30.152
I do know people ‒
medical people ‒

25:30.237 --> 25:32.696
who could help you out.

25:32.781 --> 25:36.116
But that would cost money,
wouldn't it?

25:36.201 --> 25:38.619
Yes, that's ‒
That's true.

25:38.703 --> 25:39.912
Yeah.

25:39.996 --> 25:41.914
That's true,
I'm afraid.

25:41.998 --> 25:44.708
They're
very eminent men.

25:44.793 --> 25:47.044
One particularly
I have in mind,

25:47.128 --> 25:52.216
I used to assist him
in his earlier days.

25:52.300 --> 25:55.594
Studied with him.

25:55.679 --> 25:58.806
It's, uh,
it's quite a simple matter.

26:01.393 --> 26:04.436
You ‒ You mean you know
how to do it, Mr. Christie?

26:04.521 --> 26:05.479
Oh, yes.

26:05.564 --> 26:07.523
Oh, that's not a problem.

26:07.607 --> 26:09.817
I've seen it done
100 times.

26:09.901 --> 26:12.611
"Terminations" we called them.

26:12.696 --> 26:15.906
I had to learn about that
in the police.

26:15.991 --> 26:19.326
Well...

26:19.411 --> 26:22.955
I suppose
you c-couldn't ‒

26:23.039 --> 26:27.376
Oh, I ‒ I know
it's against the law

26:27.460 --> 26:28.961
and everything.

26:30.422 --> 26:33.549
Oh, no, that's ‒
That's all right...

26:33.633 --> 26:37.219
as long as nobody goes
telling tales out of school.

26:37.304 --> 26:38.345
Sugar?

26:38.430 --> 26:39.597
No, I ‒

26:39.681 --> 26:41.932
It's the moral question
that concerns me.

26:42.017 --> 26:43.934
I wouldn't tell a soul ‒
honestly.

26:44.019 --> 26:49.023
The taking of life...
no matter how rudimentary...

26:49.107 --> 26:52.818
Well...it's not, really.

26:52.902 --> 26:59.491
I'd be...ever so grateful,
Mr. Christie.

27:06.666 --> 27:08.709
All right, I will.

27:14.549 --> 27:16.800
I didn't ‒

27:16.885 --> 27:20.137
It's such
a weight off my mind.

27:20.221 --> 27:23.641
Honestly, Mr. Christie.
Honestly.

27:26.728 --> 27:28.437
Well ‒

27:28.521 --> 27:30.981
W-When do you think
you could ‒

27:31.066 --> 27:33.776
Oh, well, do you think
you could ‒

27:33.860 --> 27:37.571
Well, you have a word
with Tim tonight, huh?

27:37.656 --> 27:40.407
Yes.

27:40.492 --> 27:43.243
And perhaps we'll be able
to fit you in tomorrow.

27:43.328 --> 27:44.578
Yes.

27:48.333 --> 27:50.334
What are you doing here?

27:52.337 --> 27:54.338
Now then, now then.

27:57.300 --> 28:00.177
I thought we'd go
to the pictures.

28:00.261 --> 28:03.347
Oh, did you then?
Yes.

28:03.431 --> 28:06.684
Now, Mrs. Christie
is looking after Geraldine...

28:06.768 --> 28:10.312
and you and I are going to have
a night out, okay?

28:10.397 --> 28:12.690
Well, all right then.
Come on.

28:14.317 --> 28:15.776
Hold the bus!

28:25.829 --> 28:30.332
♪ And when the fields ♪

28:30.417 --> 28:39.550

29:01.448 --> 29:03.824
Here's out.

29:06.828 --> 29:08.287
Did you like it?

29:08.371 --> 29:09.538
The film.

29:09.622 --> 29:11.290
Oh, it was all right.

29:11.374 --> 29:14.001
I didn't see
too much of it.

29:14.085 --> 29:15.836
I like Gregory Peck.

29:15.920 --> 29:17.296
He's okay.

29:17.380 --> 29:20.841
You know, you're
a bit like him to look at.

29:20.925 --> 29:22.092
Good God, girl,

29:22.177 --> 29:24.386
you've hardly had
one drink.

29:24.471 --> 29:25.637
No, no, you are.

29:27.056 --> 29:29.141
He's about 7'3"
for a start-off.

29:29.225 --> 29:32.019
I know,
but just around the eyes,

29:32.103 --> 29:33.687
you look like him.

29:36.608 --> 29:39.568
Mr. Christie
was talking to me today.

29:41.654 --> 29:43.405
About last night?

29:43.490 --> 29:47.743
Oh, no.
He was okay about that.

29:47.827 --> 29:49.745
He, uh...

29:49.829 --> 29:51.789
Well, he said
he might be able to help us.

29:51.873 --> 29:54.541
Huh?

29:54.626 --> 29:57.836
About the baby, you know.

29:57.921 --> 29:59.254
Oh?

29:59.339 --> 30:01.048
Well, what's he think
he can do?

30:01.132 --> 30:05.177
Well, he's had experience
with things like that.

30:07.347 --> 30:08.639
You mean...

30:08.723 --> 30:10.682
getting rid of it?

30:10.767 --> 30:13.602
Termination, it's called.

30:13.686 --> 30:17.773
Oh, I ‒ No,
I don't know about that, Beryl.

30:17.857 --> 30:20.943
I don't think he wants money
or anything like that.

30:21.027 --> 30:22.820
That's not what I mean.

30:22.904 --> 30:26.448
Tim...we can't have
another kiddie now.

30:26.533 --> 30:28.575
You know we can't.

30:28.660 --> 30:34.164
Well, I ‒ I know I could always
get a bigger job ‒

30:34.249 --> 30:36.416
pays more cash.

30:36.501 --> 30:38.794
I could go to night school ‒
get qualified in something.

30:48.388 --> 30:49.972
Well, what's he do, anyhow?

30:52.141 --> 30:54.810
I don't know.

31:01.943 --> 31:03.277
Here.

31:14.998 --> 31:16.790
All right then.

31:20.211 --> 31:23.005
Mind the beer, girl.

31:39.188 --> 31:40.856
Tim...

31:40.940 --> 31:44.276
will you tell Mr. Christie
it's all right

31:44.360 --> 31:46.361
when you go down
the stairs?

31:46.446 --> 31:49.031
I don't like it, Beryl.
Oh, Tim.

31:49.115 --> 31:52.242
You can't go back
on it now.

31:52.327 --> 31:55.370
Okay, okay.

32:09.344 --> 32:10.886
Mr. Christie?

32:16.100 --> 32:17.976
Mr. Christie?

32:20.521 --> 32:22.940
Oh, there you are,
Mr. Christie.

32:23.024 --> 32:24.942
Oh, Tim,
come in, come in.

32:25.026 --> 32:27.945
Look, Mr. Christie,
Beryl's been telling ‒

32:28.029 --> 32:30.614
Shut the door, will you?
Do you mind?

32:30.698 --> 32:32.324
Oh, no.

32:39.290 --> 32:40.707
Tim...

32:42.794 --> 32:45.629
I dislike this business
as much as you do.

32:45.713 --> 32:47.839
Well, I don't know ‒

32:47.924 --> 32:51.551
It's just that I happened to
have picked up this knowledge

32:51.636 --> 32:53.971
whilst I was in training
as a doctor

32:54.055 --> 32:55.347
before the war.

32:55.431 --> 32:57.599
Oh, I didn't know you did
all this medical stuff.

32:57.684 --> 32:58.976
Oh, yes.

32:59.060 --> 33:02.062
Yes, yes, unfortunately,
my training

33:02.146 --> 33:05.774
was interrupted
by a motoring accident,

33:05.858 --> 33:08.986
and, um,
then the war came and ‒

33:09.070 --> 33:10.904
Well, that's most ‒

33:10.989 --> 33:16.076
I was browsing through some
of my, uh, medical texts

33:16.160 --> 33:20.163
before you came in,
as a matter of fact.

33:20.248 --> 33:22.124
Perhaps you would like to...

33:23.584 --> 33:26.962
Um...

33:27.046 --> 33:29.256
Yes, well, I-I-I
don't know about all ‒

33:29.340 --> 33:31.299
all this stuff, see.

33:31.384 --> 33:33.301
No.

33:33.386 --> 33:34.302
No, no.

33:34.387 --> 33:38.682
How do you, uh...

33:38.766 --> 33:43.270
I mean...
how do you actually do it?

33:45.773 --> 33:49.943
Well, that's something only
doctors and myself know about.

33:50.028 --> 33:51.862
It has to be secret,
you understand.

33:51.946 --> 33:54.364
I mean, we couldn't have
every Tom, Dick, and Harry

33:54.449 --> 33:56.992
going around doing it,
could we?

33:57.076 --> 34:01.079
Uh, no, I-I understand that,
but, uh ‒

34:01.164 --> 34:06.001
I won't conceal the...dangers
from your mind.

34:06.085 --> 34:08.210
The, um...

34:08.295 --> 34:11.590
The, um, stuff I use ‒

34:11.674 --> 34:16.094
one in ten
might die from it.

34:16.179 --> 34:18.722
Die?

34:18.806 --> 34:21.683
Well, yes, that's
an acceptable medical risk.

34:21.768 --> 34:23.393
That's understood.

34:23.478 --> 34:27.813
Mind you, they probably use
too strong a dose.

34:27.899 --> 34:32.569
If only you and, um, Beryl
had come to me earlier,

34:32.652 --> 34:36.156
I could have done it
without any risk at all.

34:36.239 --> 34:39.701
Oh, I don't know.
I don't know, Mr. Christie.

34:42.288 --> 34:45.248
Well...Tim...

34:45.333 --> 34:47.918
if you haven't got
complete confidence

34:48.002 --> 34:49.920
in my ability...

34:51.089 --> 34:52.547
No, no.

34:52.632 --> 34:55.092
I ‒ I trust you,
Mr. Christie.

34:55.176 --> 34:57.344
Of course, I do.

34:59.388 --> 35:03.016
All right then.

35:03.101 --> 35:04.726
Good lad.

35:04.811 --> 35:07.687
Right, well, you
cut along to work.

35:07.772 --> 35:10.565
Otherwise,
you'll be late.

35:10.650 --> 35:14.736
And, uh, Tim...
remember...

35:14.821 --> 35:16.738
we've never lost
a father yet.

35:18.616 --> 35:20.158
No.

35:23.788 --> 35:27.290
Uh, thank you, Mr. Christie.

36:01.784 --> 36:03.368
Ethel?

36:03.452 --> 36:05.328
Ethel...

36:05.413 --> 36:06.705
Hmm?

36:06.789 --> 36:09.457
Ethel, I want you to go
to the, uh, office for me?

36:09.542 --> 36:10.709
See Mr. Steadman.

36:10.793 --> 36:13.003
Tell him my back's
been playing me up,

36:13.087 --> 36:14.462
and I shan't be in today.

36:14.547 --> 36:16.673
Oh, Reg, are you going
to the doctor?

36:16.757 --> 36:18.383
No. No,
I'll be all right.

36:18.467 --> 36:20.177
I'll phone
from the corner.

36:20.261 --> 36:21.344
No, you'd better go.

36:21.429 --> 36:23.346
They'll want
these bills of lading

36:23.431 --> 36:24.764
and invoices right away.

36:24.849 --> 36:26.474
Go and get your coat on.

36:26.559 --> 36:27.851
All right.

36:51.292 --> 36:53.960
I'm ready, Reg.

37:08.809 --> 37:12.062
Tell him I hope to be better
tomorrow.

37:12.146 --> 37:14.189
All right.

39:43.547 --> 39:45.215
Yes, what is it?
Mr. Christie?

39:45.299 --> 39:46.383
Yes.

39:46.467 --> 39:47.717
Ah. Builders.

39:47.802 --> 39:49.886
"Repair roof to outhouse,

39:49.970 --> 39:53.473
replaster where necessary,
and make good."

39:53.557 --> 39:56.142
Now? Uh, it's
not convenient.

39:56.227 --> 39:57.560
You are Mr. Christie?

39:57.645 --> 40:00.021
You complained to the landlord
about this outhouse.

40:02.942 --> 40:06.528
Well, I-I-I need to be
informed in advance.

40:06.612 --> 40:09.406
Look, mate, I just take
my orders from the owners.

40:09.490 --> 40:14.035
It is just the, uh,
washhouse, is it?

40:14.120 --> 40:16.162
Just the outbuildings.

40:16.247 --> 40:22.335
Well, you
better come through.

40:22.420 --> 40:25.880
Oh, thank you
very much.

40:25.965 --> 40:30.135
I was just having
a cup of tea.

40:30.219 --> 40:35.014
It's, uh, back up here
on the right.

40:41.564 --> 40:43.189
This is it.

40:43.274 --> 40:45.191
The washhouse.

40:45.276 --> 40:46.359
Right.

40:48.446 --> 40:50.363
All this lot
will have to come down

40:50.448 --> 40:52.073
for a start.

40:52.158 --> 40:54.784
How long will it take?

40:54.869 --> 40:58.830
Oh, it shouldn't take more
than a couple of days.

41:18.350 --> 41:20.643
Be careful.
Do you mind?

41:20.728 --> 41:22.520
Yeah, mind
the paintwork, mate.

41:22.605 --> 41:26.149
And the priceless
"anti-ques."

41:26.233 --> 41:28.067
Mr. Christie...

41:28.152 --> 41:29.736
are you...

41:31.780 --> 41:33.656
I've got
the builders in.

41:33.741 --> 41:36.075
Well, it doesn't matter.

42:33.884 --> 42:34.884
Oh.

42:34.969 --> 42:36.219
Here we are then.

42:36.303 --> 42:38.346
I brought you
a little cup of tea.

42:38.430 --> 42:40.390
Oh. Thank you.

42:41.976 --> 42:45.228
What are they doing ‒
the builders?

42:45.312 --> 42:46.604
Oh.

42:46.689 --> 42:49.816
They, um,
they won't disturb us.

42:49.900 --> 42:52.068
The baby asleep, is she?

42:52.152 --> 42:55.363
Oh, yes.
She's in the other room.

42:55.447 --> 42:59.534
Right. Well, uh,
we can manage in here then.

42:59.618 --> 43:02.662
Just drink your tea
and relax.

43:04.665 --> 43:06.374
Is it going to hurt?

43:06.458 --> 43:10.461
Just a little twinge,
but, uh, we can help that.

43:10.546 --> 43:14.507
Open the window for me ‒
6 inches ‒ will you?

43:14.592 --> 43:18.344
And perhaps you
better pull down the blind.

43:36.030 --> 43:38.156
Fast asleep.

43:40.743 --> 43:42.869
All right.

43:45.205 --> 43:50.376
Just pass me my bag,
will you?

43:50.461 --> 43:52.462
Ta.

43:57.301 --> 43:59.093
Oh! What's that for?

43:59.178 --> 44:03.806
Just a ‒
a whiff of gas.

44:03.891 --> 44:05.308
Gas?
Like at the dentist's ‒

44:05.392 --> 44:07.602
take away
those little twinges.

44:07.686 --> 44:09.562
But that's poisonous,
isn't it?

44:09.647 --> 44:12.607
Oh, no ‒
not the way we use it.

44:12.691 --> 44:16.611
Something we had to learn
during the war

44:16.695 --> 44:20.531
for bomb victims...

44:20.616 --> 44:24.202
that needed...
urgent surgery.

44:24.286 --> 44:30.041
It's a chemically compounded
filter, you see?

44:30.125 --> 44:31.793
The liquid...

44:34.338 --> 44:36.756
...takes out
the carbon monoxide,

44:36.840 --> 44:41.052
or CO2, as we call it.

44:44.640 --> 44:46.182
There.

44:46.266 --> 44:47.725
Right.

44:47.810 --> 44:49.310
Right.

44:49.395 --> 44:50.937
Just get...

44:51.021 --> 44:52.689
scrubbed up.

44:55.025 --> 44:59.362
There isn't any cutting,
is there?

44:59.446 --> 45:02.198
Oh, no, no.
No, no.

45:05.786 --> 45:08.204
Oh.

45:08.288 --> 45:09.247
Ta.

45:09.331 --> 45:14.794
I'm ever so nervous,
Mr. Christie.

45:14.878 --> 45:19.590
There's no need to be ‒
no need at all.

45:19.675 --> 45:24.303
Do you, um, have, uh,
undergarments on?

45:24.388 --> 45:26.222
Yes.

45:26.306 --> 45:30.309
Well, just slip them off,
will you?

45:47.161 --> 45:50.830
Um, should I take
my dress off?

45:50.914 --> 45:53.416
No, no.
Just the, um...

45:53.500 --> 45:57.295
And then lie down
on the quilt.

46:08.307 --> 46:09.515
Right down?

46:09.600 --> 46:12.643
Yes, just lie down
and relax.

46:18.317 --> 46:21.486
You ready?

46:21.570 --> 46:23.571
Yes.

46:30.746 --> 46:33.331
That's a good girl.

46:35.334 --> 46:37.710
Now...just...

46:37.795 --> 46:42.757
a little...whiff
of the gas.

46:42.841 --> 46:46.469
You've, uh, had gas before
at the dentist, have you?

46:46.553 --> 46:49.263
You know
what it feels like then.

46:49.348 --> 46:52.016
You'll feel
just a little bit dizzy,

46:52.100 --> 46:53.518
I expect.

46:55.103 --> 46:57.355
All right.
Now...breathe deeply.

46:57.439 --> 46:58.815
Breathe ‒ Just relax.

46:58.899 --> 47:00.942
Breathe deeply.
Close your eyes.

47:02.486 --> 47:05.613
Close your eyes.
That's a good girl.

47:05.697 --> 47:07.865
That's a good girl.

47:07.950 --> 47:09.492
Breathe.

47:09.576 --> 47:11.285
Breathe.

47:11.370 --> 47:14.038
Breathe, Beryl.

47:14.122 --> 47:18.876
That's it.

47:18.961 --> 47:20.586
That's it.

47:23.090 --> 47:24.757
No. No.

47:24.842 --> 47:26.467
Aaah!
No, no, no.

47:26.552 --> 47:27.969
Quiet. Quiet!

47:28.053 --> 47:30.221
Be quiet!

47:30.305 --> 47:32.056
Be ‒ Be ‒ Be quiet!

47:32.140 --> 47:33.391
Quiet!

47:33.475 --> 47:34.392
Aaah! No!

47:34.476 --> 47:36.102
Don't make me hurt you.

47:36.186 --> 47:37.270
Please. Please.

47:37.354 --> 47:38.563
Don't make me hurt you.

47:38.647 --> 47:39.897
No!
Please!

47:40.983 --> 47:43.943
Ugh!

47:49.324 --> 47:51.659
Oh, Beryl.

47:51.743 --> 47:53.870
Oh, Beryl.

47:53.954 --> 47:56.122
Oh, Beryl.

47:56.206 --> 47:59.000
Oh, oh, Beryl.

48:29.531 --> 48:31.240
Howdy-howdy-do.

48:32.993 --> 48:34.994
Hey, come on.
Come on.

48:37.748 --> 48:41.500
Beryl!

48:53.931 --> 48:55.932
Beryl!

49:01.939 --> 49:05.608
Beryl?

49:08.195 --> 49:13.324
If you don't want to see me,
you've only got to say so.

49:16.703 --> 49:19.705
Beryl.

49:54.324 --> 49:57.118
Mommy.

50:02.541 --> 50:04.375
Mommy.

50:34.364 --> 50:37.783
Oh, hello, Mr. Christie.

50:37.868 --> 50:40.661
It's bad news, Tim.

50:40.746 --> 50:43.080
It didn't work.

50:45.208 --> 50:46.459
Huh?

50:46.543 --> 50:48.294
Where's Beryl then?

50:48.378 --> 50:50.629
She's upstairs
on the bed...

50:50.714 --> 50:52.256
Oh, Tim.

50:52.340 --> 50:54.717
...lying down.

50:54.801 --> 50:56.385
Go on up.

50:56.470 --> 50:58.804
I'll come up with you.

51:12.986 --> 51:14.820
Beryl?

51:23.830 --> 51:25.247
What ‒

51:25.332 --> 51:28.793
She's got...blood
all down her chin.

51:28.877 --> 51:32.379
That's the concussion,
I'm afraid.

51:32.464 --> 51:35.633
She would struggle,
you see ‒

51:35.717 --> 51:39.595
Concussed her head
against the bed-head.

51:39.679 --> 51:43.682
It's got sharp corners,
that bed-head.

51:45.685 --> 51:47.436
Beryl...

51:55.487 --> 51:57.196
She's not alive.

51:57.280 --> 51:59.865
I told you
it was bad.

51:59.950 --> 52:02.701
You ‒
You never said ‒

52:02.786 --> 52:05.788
One out of ten
die of it ‒

52:05.872 --> 52:07.873
I told you that.

52:07.958 --> 52:11.085
Oh, Christ.

52:13.839 --> 52:15.840
I'm sorry, Tim.

52:16.883 --> 52:19.677
These things happen,
though.

52:19.761 --> 52:24.598
She should have
approached me earlier.

52:24.683 --> 52:28.853
Oh, God,
she was only young.

52:28.937 --> 52:31.480
Yes, it's
a terrible thing.

52:31.565 --> 52:35.860
But she'd have had to be
in hospital by now, anyway.

52:35.944 --> 52:39.280
Doctors couldn't have
helped her even.

52:39.364 --> 52:42.533
Her tummy
was septic poisoned ‒

52:42.617 --> 52:47.204
all those pills she'd been
dosing herself up with.

52:47.289 --> 52:51.792
Oh, God! Oh, God!
Them damned pills!

52:51.877 --> 52:54.211
Don't ‒ Don't wake
the baby, Tim.

52:56.298 --> 52:58.507
What am I going
to do?

52:58.592 --> 53:00.718
Come with me.
Come on.

53:00.802 --> 53:02.678
Come on.

53:10.478 --> 53:12.313
Sit down.

53:14.774 --> 53:18.527
Would you get
the doctor?

53:18.612 --> 53:20.237
Doctors...

53:20.322 --> 53:23.949
can't do much now,
I'm afraid, Tim.

53:24.034 --> 53:27.203
Well,
we gotta do something ‒

53:27.287 --> 53:29.747
the police or something.

53:29.831 --> 53:31.832
Yes, you may be right.

53:31.917 --> 53:35.169
Well, that's what I think,
anyhow.

53:37.172 --> 53:41.008
It'll be criminal manslaughter
for me, of course.

53:43.053 --> 53:44.720
Oh, God.

53:44.804 --> 53:48.641
I-I don't want to get you
into trouble, Mr. Christie.

53:48.725 --> 53:50.976
Well, I'm not just thinking
about me so much.

53:51.061 --> 53:54.396
I'm not
the only one involved.

53:54.481 --> 53:58.192
You knew all about it,
didn't you?

54:00.278 --> 54:02.404
Well, of course
I knew about it!

54:02.489 --> 54:05.824
Well, don't get huffy with me,
my lad.

54:07.160 --> 54:09.787
You knew about it ‒
that's the point.

54:09.871 --> 54:12.498
You're an accessory
before the act.

54:13.833 --> 54:17.086
But...well, I done nothing.

54:17.170 --> 54:22.049
Oh, God, I done nothing.

54:23.635 --> 54:25.678
But you knew about it, Tim.

54:26.846 --> 54:28.389
You consented ‒

54:28.473 --> 54:30.182
That's all they'll want to know.

54:30.267 --> 54:32.309
All right.

54:32.394 --> 54:34.937
All right, then, I'll ‒
I'll not tell them nothing.

54:35.021 --> 54:36.772
I'll just say
I don't know nothing

54:36.856 --> 54:38.941
and just keep clammed up.

54:41.695 --> 54:43.487
You better go
and see to the baby.

54:43.571 --> 54:46.615
You can't leave her crying
like that.

55:04.634 --> 55:06.260
Poor old Tim, eh?

55:08.930 --> 55:11.390
I could get you out
of this

55:11.474 --> 55:13.642
if only you didn't keep
talking so silly.

55:16.604 --> 55:20.607
I-I just don't know
what to do.

55:22.193 --> 55:25.612
Well, we could keep quiet
about it, couldn't we?

55:28.158 --> 55:32.244
She's just lying there.

55:34.331 --> 55:35.956
Well...

55:36.041 --> 55:38.250
there are ways of...

55:38.335 --> 55:40.544
disposing of bodies.

55:40.628 --> 55:45.382
What ‒ not be buried,
you mean?

55:45.467 --> 55:48.177
No p-proper service?

55:48.261 --> 55:50.262
What good
would a proper service do?

55:50.347 --> 55:53.515
Well, she'd want it,
that's what.

55:53.600 --> 55:56.602
And me too ‒
I wa‒ I want it.

55:58.146 --> 56:00.189
You want it? She'd want it?

56:00.273 --> 56:02.816
You want to be hung?

56:04.861 --> 56:07.112
Is that what you want?

56:27.175 --> 56:29.968
You better see
to the baby's supper.

56:30.053 --> 56:32.638
She'll be crying for it
in a minute.

56:38.895 --> 56:42.940
They don't hang you
for manslaughter anyhow.

56:43.024 --> 56:44.566
No.

56:44.651 --> 56:47.861
They do for murder, though.

56:50.448 --> 56:52.658
They'll just think
you killed her

56:52.742 --> 56:54.910
in one of those fights
of yours.

56:54.994 --> 56:57.162
She's got that knock
on the head.

56:57.247 --> 56:58.622
The whole street knows

56:58.706 --> 57:00.874
about those fights you have
all the time.

57:00.959 --> 57:02.793
The police know even.

57:04.337 --> 57:06.255
What do you mean?

57:06.339 --> 57:10.759
I mean...you start going
to the police or whatever,

57:10.844 --> 57:15.764
and I'm going to have to deny
I had anything to do with it.

57:15.849 --> 57:17.850
Oh, they'll know bec--

57:19.310 --> 57:22.980
They'll know
from the operation you did.

57:23.064 --> 57:24.565
Oh, no, my lad.

57:24.649 --> 57:28.026
There are no visible signs,
not the way I do it.

57:28.111 --> 57:29.486
All right then!

57:29.571 --> 57:32.739
All right, I'll tell them,
and then they'll know.

57:32.824 --> 57:35.159
Who do you think
they'll believe, Tim?

57:35.243 --> 57:38.162
Everyone around here knows
these stories you come out with

57:38.246 --> 57:42.082
about your father being
an Italian count and everything.

57:42.167 --> 57:45.419
Oh, it's just storifying.
Everyone knows that.

57:50.842 --> 57:53.469
Anyhow, he was an Italian,
my father.

57:53.553 --> 57:56.138
Well, he may not have been
a count.

57:56.222 --> 57:57.806
I don't know about that.

57:57.891 --> 57:59.475
An Italian named Evans?

57:59.559 --> 58:01.310
That's just a name he used

58:01.394 --> 58:04.146
so as people wouldn't know
who he was.

58:04.230 --> 58:07.399
Well, he was
in this secret business, see?

58:07.484 --> 58:09.401
That's why he was so rich.

58:09.486 --> 58:12.988
He had all this money
and shares and everything.

58:13.072 --> 58:16.658
Only he lost it
'cause he was killed in the war.

58:16.743 --> 58:20.704
So, who are the police
going to believe, eh?

58:20.788 --> 58:22.331
You?

58:22.415 --> 58:26.001
Or me, that was a special
constable for four years?

58:26.085 --> 58:28.253
Me, of course! Me!

58:28.338 --> 58:29.922
All right, then, Tim.

58:30.006 --> 58:32.591
Well, you go to the police
and tell them.

58:32.675 --> 58:33.759
Go on.

58:36.054 --> 58:39.765
Off you go.
All right, I will, too.

58:39.849 --> 58:42.559
Well, they'll have to believe
the truth.

58:44.229 --> 58:45.896
Oh, go on then,
if you're going.

58:48.274 --> 58:49.900
Well, I can't go now,
can I?

58:49.984 --> 58:52.236
I've got the baby to feed.

58:52.320 --> 58:53.862
Oh, I'll do that.

58:53.947 --> 58:56.949
I'll do that for you
while you're gone.

59:07.293 --> 59:10.087
W-Well... you tell me ‒

59:10.171 --> 59:14.550
Tell me w-what to do,
then I won't go.

59:14.634 --> 59:17.594
No, you've got to do
what you think is right.

59:17.679 --> 59:19.930
We'll shut the door
and talk, eh?

59:22.809 --> 59:24.309
All right.

59:28.898 --> 59:31.525
You're gonna be guided
by me, hmm?

59:31.609 --> 59:34.486
Yes, okay, Mr. Christie.

59:34.571 --> 59:36.071
All right.

59:36.155 --> 59:38.782
Sit down.

59:41.828 --> 59:43.495
Now...

59:43.580 --> 59:46.415
first of all, there's Beryl.

59:47.709 --> 59:49.668
I'll look after that.

59:49.752 --> 59:52.713
And, uh,
I'll dispose of her.

59:52.797 --> 59:55.757
I'll wait
till I get a chance.

59:55.842 --> 59:57.676
You know the, uh ‒

59:57.760 --> 01:00:01.597
the big, uh, manhole cover
by the front door?

01:00:01.681 --> 01:00:03.890
I'll lay her to rest there.

01:00:03.975 --> 01:00:05.475
Oh! Oh, God!

01:00:05.560 --> 01:00:08.186
This is no time for you
to break down.

01:00:08.271 --> 01:00:10.022
Yes, I know.
I'm sorry.

01:00:11.649 --> 01:00:14.318
It'd look better
if you went away for a bit.

01:00:14.402 --> 01:00:16.528
Right away, tonight ‒
out of London.

01:00:16.613 --> 01:00:17.863
I don't ‒

01:00:17.947 --> 01:00:19.448
Listen to me.

01:00:19.532 --> 01:00:22.159
Then I could tell people

01:00:22.243 --> 01:00:26.288
that you and Beryl
had gone away together.

01:00:28.082 --> 01:00:32.419
And what about the baby,
Geraldine?

01:00:32.503 --> 01:00:34.087
Oh, she'll be all right.

01:00:34.172 --> 01:00:36.757
It's very lucky,
as a matter of fact.

01:00:36.841 --> 01:00:39.760
There's a young couple
over at Acton I know

01:00:39.844 --> 01:00:42.137
who'll look after her
for you ‒

01:00:42.221 --> 01:00:45.098
East Acton, to be precise.

01:00:45.183 --> 01:00:48.101
They...can't have any
of their own,

01:00:48.186 --> 01:00:49.895
so it's handy really.

01:00:49.979 --> 01:00:53.815
So you just, uh,
leave all her things packed up,

01:00:53.900 --> 01:00:57.527
and I'll get them to come over
and collect her in the morning.

01:00:58.780 --> 01:01:01.323
But I'll...be able
to have her back, won't I?

01:01:01.407 --> 01:01:04.159
I mean, when ‒
when all this has blown over?

01:01:04.243 --> 01:01:06.662
Oh, yes. Yes.

01:01:06.746 --> 01:01:09.456
Yes, I daresay.

01:01:12.752 --> 01:01:15.504
Right, then.
You get the baby fed.

01:01:15.588 --> 01:01:17.881
Oh, God, Mr. Christie.

01:01:17.965 --> 01:01:20.342
And she was only young.

01:01:20.426 --> 01:01:24.805
If...she'd come to me
earlier...

01:02:07.515 --> 01:02:11.101
Come and give me a hand.

01:02:18.234 --> 01:02:20.944
Grab her.
Grab her legs.

01:02:40.631 --> 01:02:44.050
Let her down.
Let her down.

01:02:44.135 --> 01:02:46.928
We'll put her
in Kitchener's place.

01:02:47.013 --> 01:02:51.057
The old man's in hospital.
He won't be back for days.

01:03:09.452 --> 01:03:13.830
She'll be all right in there
for tonight.

01:03:13.915 --> 01:03:15.165
Take this.

01:03:15.249 --> 01:03:16.625
What's this?

01:03:16.709 --> 01:03:18.168
Wedding ring.

01:03:18.252 --> 01:03:19.503
Sell it.

01:03:19.587 --> 01:03:23.131
It'll make her
less easy to identify

01:03:23.216 --> 01:03:25.717
if they do ever find her.

01:03:25.802 --> 01:03:27.677
Oh.

01:03:27.762 --> 01:03:29.805
Now you get packed...

01:03:29.889 --> 01:03:33.809
and then g‒
get a night train anywhere.

01:03:33.893 --> 01:03:36.561
And I'll get those people
over from East Acton

01:03:36.646 --> 01:03:39.940
first thing in the morning
for the baby.

01:03:41.567 --> 01:03:44.820
You better go
and finish feeding her.

01:03:44.904 --> 01:03:46.321
Mr. Christie...

01:03:49.033 --> 01:03:51.159
Go on. Go on.

01:06:24.981 --> 01:06:26.982
Hello, Auntie Vi.

01:06:27.066 --> 01:06:30.986
Tim! What are you doing
down here?

01:06:31.070 --> 01:06:33.488
Come in!
Come in!

01:06:36.867 --> 01:06:39.786
Con, it's Tim.

01:06:39.870 --> 01:06:41.997
Tim, boy!

01:06:42.081 --> 01:06:45.041
Hey, what are you doing
in this neck of the woods?

01:06:45.126 --> 01:06:47.335
Sit down, Tim.
Take your coat off.

01:06:47.420 --> 01:06:48.628
Well, me and the boss

01:06:48.713 --> 01:06:51.756
is, uh, touring around
trying to find new branches.

01:06:51.841 --> 01:06:54.050
Only the car broke down
in Cardiff.

01:06:54.135 --> 01:06:55.969
There's tea
fresh brewed, Tim.

01:06:56.053 --> 01:06:57.721
You still like
egg and fried bread?

01:06:57.805 --> 01:06:59.347
Oh, smashing!

01:06:59.432 --> 01:07:05.395
It'll be a few days, the car.
Big end's gone, they said.

01:07:05.479 --> 01:07:06.896
How's Beryl?

01:07:06.981 --> 01:07:10.025
We can put you up
on the settee in
the back room if you like.

01:07:10.109 --> 01:07:11.151
Thanks, Auntie.

01:07:11.235 --> 01:07:13.153
How's Beryl
and the baby?

01:07:13.237 --> 01:07:14.487
Oh, fine, fine.

01:07:14.572 --> 01:07:17.532
They've got to Brighton
for a bit ‒

01:07:17.616 --> 01:07:19.617
stay with Beryl's father.

01:07:26.167 --> 01:07:29.085
I've just been upstairs.

01:07:29.170 --> 01:07:31.004
He's gone.

01:07:31.088 --> 01:07:32.088
Tim?

01:07:32.173 --> 01:07:34.299
Packed up and left ‒

01:07:34.383 --> 01:07:39.220
his clothes and everything,
scarpered.

01:07:39.305 --> 01:07:43.725
And that's not
the worst part.

01:07:43.809 --> 01:07:46.936
What's the matter, Reg?

01:07:47.021 --> 01:07:50.398
You know what
he's gone and done?

01:07:50.483 --> 01:07:52.358
What?

01:07:52.443 --> 01:07:57.530
He's killed the baby.

01:07:57.615 --> 01:07:58.907
I don't believe it.

01:07:58.991 --> 01:08:01.743
Strangled, if you must know,
with his tie.

01:08:01.827 --> 01:08:03.244
He'd never do that!

01:08:03.329 --> 01:08:05.580
Never mind what he'd never do.
It's what he's done.

01:08:05.664 --> 01:08:11.336
He worshipped that child.
Reg, what are we going to do?

01:08:14.632 --> 01:08:16.299
Nothing.

01:10:07.661 --> 01:10:08.870
Hey.

01:10:08.954 --> 01:10:11.539
See what I bought Geraldine
in Cardiff?

01:10:11.624 --> 01:10:14.834
Did you go into the garage
about the car?

01:10:14.919 --> 01:10:17.921
Oh, yes, yes.
They say it'll be a bit.

01:10:18.005 --> 01:10:19.547
They'll let me know.

01:10:19.632 --> 01:10:20.882
There.

01:10:20.966 --> 01:10:22.842
Woolworth's I got it.

01:10:22.927 --> 01:10:25.094
Oh, it's lovely, Tim.

01:10:25.179 --> 01:10:27.388
Tim, your uncle and I

01:10:27.473 --> 01:10:31.434
wrote a letter
to Mr. Thorley on Monday.

01:10:31.518 --> 01:10:32.644
Thorley?

01:10:32.728 --> 01:10:33.895
Beryl's father.

01:10:33.979 --> 01:10:36.231
What do you want to write
to him for?!

01:10:36.315 --> 01:10:38.274
We got a telegram
this morning.

01:10:38.359 --> 01:10:41.736
He said he hasn't seen Beryl
and the baby since the summer.

01:10:41.820 --> 01:10:45.240
What do you want to go
poking around for?!

01:10:45.324 --> 01:10:47.992
But where is she, Tim?
What's happened?

01:10:48.077 --> 01:10:50.745
I don't want to talk
about it.

01:10:50.829 --> 01:10:53.665
And none of your business
anyhow!

01:10:53.749 --> 01:10:56.793
She's ‒
She's gone off.

01:10:56.877 --> 01:10:58.253
Gone off?

01:10:58.337 --> 01:11:01.965
With, uh, some fellow.
I don't know, do I?!

01:11:02.049 --> 01:11:03.383
In a car.

01:11:03.467 --> 01:11:06.010
But what about
little Geraldine?

01:11:06.095 --> 01:11:08.888
Look, just stop asking questions
at me, will you?!

01:11:08.973 --> 01:11:09.847
Now then ‒

01:11:09.932 --> 01:11:11.391
Don't you "now then" me!

01:11:11.475 --> 01:11:13.768
She's gone off
with some...rich fellow,

01:11:13.852 --> 01:11:15.937
and that's all there is
about it!

01:11:16.021 --> 01:11:18.273
She's not
that sort of a girl, Tim.

01:11:18.357 --> 01:11:20.608
I'm going out!
I'm bloody going out!

01:12:04.445 --> 01:12:07.447
Here, I think
that's the number.

01:12:07.531 --> 01:12:09.032
Yeah, that's okay.

01:12:09.116 --> 01:12:11.034
There is a record card.

01:12:11.118 --> 01:12:12.243
Ah.

01:12:17.833 --> 01:12:19.417
Uh...

01:12:19.501 --> 01:12:21.544
Yes, sir?

01:12:21.628 --> 01:12:26.049
Is there an inspector
or sergeant or somebody here?

01:12:26.133 --> 01:12:29.052
There's nobody available
at the moment, sir.

01:12:29.136 --> 01:12:32.055
Can I help you?

01:12:32.139 --> 01:12:37.268
I'd like to have a bit of a chat
with you alone, like.

01:12:37.353 --> 01:12:38.603
Right.

01:12:38.687 --> 01:12:41.147
Excuse me, sir.

01:12:44.943 --> 01:12:48.529
Well, now.

01:12:48.614 --> 01:12:50.990
I want to give myself up.

01:12:51.075 --> 01:12:53.409
I've disposed of my wife.

01:12:53.494 --> 01:12:54.744
Now, wait a minute.

01:12:54.828 --> 01:12:57.080
Do you realize
what you're saying?

01:12:57.164 --> 01:12:59.207
I know what I'm saying.

01:12:59.291 --> 01:13:03.669
I can't sleep for it.
I want to get it off my chest.

01:13:03.754 --> 01:13:06.798
She was expecting, see?

01:13:06.882 --> 01:13:10.051
And we have one already.

01:13:10.135 --> 01:13:12.428
Anyhow, I met this fellow
in Ipswich.

01:13:12.513 --> 01:13:14.514
He just come up to me
in a caff

01:13:14.598 --> 01:13:16.724
and give me
this bottle of stuff.

01:13:16.809 --> 01:13:18.267
I told her not to take it,

01:13:18.352 --> 01:13:20.728
but she said
she was going to anyhow.

01:13:20.813 --> 01:13:24.273
So, I come home from work,
and there she is dead.

01:13:24.358 --> 01:13:27.026
She had the empty bottle
beside her.

01:13:27.111 --> 01:13:30.029
I didn't know what to do
so...I got ‒

01:13:30.114 --> 01:13:31.739
I didn't know what to do,

01:13:31.824 --> 01:13:34.784
so at 2:00 in the morning
I got her downstairs

01:13:34.868 --> 01:13:37.829
and I opened the drain
outside the front door

01:13:37.913 --> 01:13:40.623
and I put her...body...
down the drain.

01:13:44.628 --> 01:13:46.337
And then I come down here.

01:13:46.422 --> 01:13:49.799
Do you want to make a statement
in writing?

01:13:49.883 --> 01:13:53.094
Uh...

01:13:53.178 --> 01:13:56.931
Well, I'll tell you about it
and you write it down, eh?

01:13:57.015 --> 01:13:58.766
I'm not all that educated.

01:13:58.851 --> 01:14:01.519
I can't do this reading
and writing.

01:14:28.213 --> 01:14:31.174
Yes.
That's what he said.

01:14:31.258 --> 01:14:35.011
Well, he's a bit simple,
you know.

01:14:35.095 --> 01:14:38.347
Okay. I'll have another go
at him.

01:14:38.432 --> 01:14:40.266
Yeah. Bye.

01:14:47.149 --> 01:14:49.817
Well, now...

01:14:49.902 --> 01:14:52.987
The drain where you said
you put your wife's body ‒

01:14:53.071 --> 01:14:54.655
it's been examined.

01:14:54.740 --> 01:14:59.410
There's nothing there.

01:15:01.997 --> 01:15:03.915
Well, I-I put it there.

01:15:03.999 --> 01:15:08.169
I see.

01:15:08.253 --> 01:15:11.631
It's a manhole, is it?

01:15:11.715 --> 01:15:14.425
Uh...I expect so.

01:15:14.510 --> 01:15:17.303
Who helped you lift
the lid off?

01:15:17.387 --> 01:15:19.013
I did it myself.

01:15:19.097 --> 01:15:22.183
Who are you trying to kid?

01:15:22.267 --> 01:15:25.436
It took three men
to lift it.

01:15:25.521 --> 01:15:27.897
Well, I don't know
about that.

01:15:27.981 --> 01:15:30.107
I did it!

01:15:30.192 --> 01:15:33.236
I don't think your wife's body
was ever down that drain.

01:15:35.906 --> 01:15:37.323
All right.

01:15:37.407 --> 01:15:41.827
All right, I only said that
to protect a man named Christie.

01:15:41.912 --> 01:15:43.829
Christie?

01:15:43.914 --> 01:15:45.665
Yes.

01:15:45.749 --> 01:15:50.086
It's not true
about the man in the caff.

01:15:50.170 --> 01:15:53.589
Now I'll tell you the truth.

01:15:56.927 --> 01:16:00.054
She wasn't very good
with money, I'm afraid.

01:16:00.138 --> 01:16:02.181
Run up a lot of bad debts.

01:16:02.266 --> 01:16:06.018
That was one of the reasons
they were always fighting.

01:16:10.857 --> 01:16:14.485
This was...
their little domain.

01:16:14.570 --> 01:16:18.072
What is it?
Just the two rooms?

01:16:18.156 --> 01:16:20.783
Just the two rooms, yes.

01:16:23.829 --> 01:16:25.746
You'd only have to ask
the neighbors

01:16:25.831 --> 01:16:27.915
about the fights they had,
I'm afraid.

01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:29.875
One of your chaps
from the station

01:16:29.960 --> 01:16:32.587
had to come around one night,
as a matter of fact.

01:16:32.671 --> 01:16:35.047
You saw them go, did you?

01:16:35.132 --> 01:16:37.425
No, they just crept off.

01:16:37.509 --> 01:16:39.677
Who has the flat
below this?

01:16:39.761 --> 01:16:42.263
Mr. Kitchener,
an old gentleman ‒

01:16:42.347 --> 01:16:44.015
worked on the railways.

01:16:50.856 --> 01:16:54.150
Inspector, you'd want to look
at his flat ‒

01:16:54.234 --> 01:16:56.444
Mr. Kitchener's ‒
I expect?

01:16:56.528 --> 01:16:57.778
Oh, yes.

01:16:57.863 --> 01:17:00.448
Yes, well, he's in hospital
at the moment,

01:17:00.532 --> 01:17:01.866
so he'll not mind.

01:17:03.368 --> 01:17:05.620
I just found these, sir.

01:17:07.706 --> 01:17:09.624
They're all about
the torso murder case.

01:17:09.708 --> 01:17:12.752
Oh, yes, a bit morbid
about that case, Tim was.

01:17:12.836 --> 01:17:15.921
Kept all the newspaper cuttings.
Can't think why.

01:17:16.006 --> 01:17:18.049
I thought he couldn't read.

01:17:18.133 --> 01:17:21.469
No, he used to get Beryl
to read them to him.

01:17:21.553 --> 01:17:22.595
Ah.

01:17:22.679 --> 01:17:24.680
I better take a look
in here first.

01:17:24.765 --> 01:17:27.433
I've just left the kettle on
in the kitchen.

01:17:27.517 --> 01:17:28.851
I'll just, uh...

01:17:33.315 --> 01:17:35.733
Shoo! Go on, get out!

01:17:35.817 --> 01:17:37.568
Get out! Shoo!

01:17:46.703 --> 01:17:50.039
This is the back garden.

01:17:55.462 --> 01:17:57.963
Can't seem
to get this open.

01:17:58.048 --> 01:18:01.092
It, uh, gets jammed
occasionally.

01:18:01.176 --> 01:18:03.594
Go and get the poker, Ethel.

01:18:32.541 --> 01:18:35.209
There's a sort of bundle
under the sink here.

01:18:35.293 --> 01:18:37.545
What's that, Mrs. Christie?
Do you know?

01:18:37.629 --> 01:18:39.004
Well, take a look.

01:18:39.089 --> 01:18:41.966
It's a bundle of something.
Do you know what's in it?

01:18:42.050 --> 01:18:43.259
No.

01:18:43.343 --> 01:18:46.262
It's tablecloth or something.
It's all wrapped up.

01:18:46.346 --> 01:18:47.430
Is that yours?

01:18:47.514 --> 01:18:49.432
No, I don't think so.

01:18:49.516 --> 01:18:53.227
Well, feel it.
Feel if you recognize it.

01:18:53.311 --> 01:18:55.104
No, I've never seen it
before.

01:18:55.188 --> 01:18:58.107
All right, drag it out.
Let's have a look at it.

01:18:58.191 --> 01:19:01.610
It weighs a ton.

01:19:10.328 --> 01:19:13.914
Better cut the cord.
If you've no objection, madam.

01:19:13.999 --> 01:19:18.377
No, not at all.
It isn't mine anyway.

01:19:25.260 --> 01:19:28.095
There's another one here.

01:19:28.180 --> 01:19:30.431
It's a baby.

01:19:33.852 --> 01:19:37.313
Did they ask Mr. Christie
if he could get the baby back

01:19:37.397 --> 01:19:39.940
from the people in Acton,
do you know?

01:19:43.487 --> 01:19:44.945
Well, bloody hell.

01:19:45.030 --> 01:19:47.656
Are you gonna keep this up
all the way to London?

01:19:54.539 --> 01:19:56.457
"At 11:50 A.M. today,

01:19:56.541 --> 01:19:59.335
"I found the dead body
of your wife, Beryl Evans,

01:19:59.419 --> 01:20:00.961
"concealed in a washhouse

01:20:01.046 --> 01:20:03.464
"at 10 Rillington Place,
Notting Hill.

01:20:03.548 --> 01:20:06.300
"Also the body
of your baby daughter Geraldine

01:20:06.384 --> 01:20:07.968
"in the same outbuilding,

01:20:08.053 --> 01:20:10.387
"and this clothing
was found on them.

01:20:10.472 --> 01:20:13.474
"Later today I was present
at Kensington mortuary

01:20:13.558 --> 01:20:14.975
"when it was established

01:20:15.060 --> 01:20:18.479
"that the cause of death
was strangulation in both cases.

01:20:18.563 --> 01:20:20.231
"I have reason to believe

01:20:20.315 --> 01:20:23.400
that you were responsible
for their deaths."

01:20:33.703 --> 01:20:36.413
Yes.

01:20:43.839 --> 01:20:44.964
All right then.

01:20:45.048 --> 01:20:48.801
"She was incurring
one debt after another,

01:20:48.885 --> 01:20:52.263
"and I could not stand it
any longer.

01:20:52.347 --> 01:20:55.057
"So I strangled her
with a piece of rope

01:20:55.141 --> 01:20:58.519
"and took her down
to the flat below the same night

01:20:58.603 --> 01:21:01.105
"whilst the old man
was in hospital.

01:21:01.189 --> 01:21:05.025
"I waited until the Christies
downstairs had gone to bed,

01:21:05.110 --> 01:21:07.278
"then I took her
to the washhouse

01:21:07.362 --> 01:21:08.821
"after midnight.

01:21:08.905 --> 01:21:13.367
"Then I strangled my baby
in our bedroom with my tie

01:21:13.451 --> 01:21:16.453
and took her
to the washhouse."

01:21:16.538 --> 01:21:19.665
Sign there, lad.

01:21:19.749 --> 01:21:22.751
If you don't know
how to write your name,

01:21:22.836 --> 01:21:24.962
just put a cross.

01:21:25.046 --> 01:21:27.214
I know how to write my name.

01:21:27.299 --> 01:21:29.633
Good, lad.
Just sign there then.

01:21:54.993 --> 01:21:57.077
Mr. Christie...

01:21:57.162 --> 01:21:59.330
I have got to suggest
to you ‒

01:21:59.414 --> 01:22:03.751
and I do not want there to be
any misapprehensions about it ‒

01:22:03.835 --> 01:22:07.504
that you are responsible
for the death of Mrs. Evans

01:22:07.589 --> 01:22:09.965
and of the little girl.

01:22:10.050 --> 01:22:11.592
Or if that is not so,

01:22:11.676 --> 01:22:15.220
that at least you know very much
more about those deaths

01:22:15.305 --> 01:22:17.389
than you've said.

01:22:17.474 --> 01:22:20.601
That is a lie.

01:22:20.685 --> 01:22:23.228
That is a lie.

01:22:23.313 --> 01:22:27.066
Did you know
that Mrs. Evans was pregnant

01:22:27.150 --> 01:22:29.610
in November last year?

01:22:29.694 --> 01:22:31.528
My wife told me.

01:22:31.613 --> 01:22:35.157
Did you have any discussion
with her or Mr. Evans?

01:22:37.702 --> 01:22:40.412
We understood from what
Mrs. Evans told my wife

01:22:40.497 --> 01:22:44.333
that she had been taking
pills and various things

01:22:44.417 --> 01:22:48.462
to procure an abortion.

01:22:48.546 --> 01:22:50.589
Now, I suggest to you

01:22:50.674 --> 01:22:54.301
that a little later
you said to Evans,

01:22:54.386 --> 01:22:58.472
"If you or your wife had come
to me in the first place,

01:22:58.556 --> 01:23:02.101
I could have done it for you
without any risk."

01:23:02.185 --> 01:23:05.062
No, definitely not.

01:23:05.146 --> 01:23:07.523
Do you remember
him saying to you,

01:23:07.607 --> 01:23:11.151
"I didn't think you knew
anything about medical stuff"?

01:23:11.236 --> 01:23:13.070
No, he ‒

01:23:13.154 --> 01:23:14.488
And that you said

01:23:14.572 --> 01:23:17.282
that you'd been training to be
a doctor before the war?

01:23:17.367 --> 01:23:19.576
No, that's nonsense.

01:23:19.661 --> 01:23:23.497
Do you remember showing Evans
some medical books

01:23:23.581 --> 01:23:24.665
in your flat?

01:23:24.749 --> 01:23:26.583
I have not got
any medical books,

01:23:26.668 --> 01:23:30.129
except the St. John's ambulance
handbook.

01:23:30.213 --> 01:23:32.965
Did you show this book
to Evans?

01:23:33.049 --> 01:23:36.051
No, certainly not.
It's an obsolete book.

01:23:36.136 --> 01:23:38.095
I daresay it's obsolete,
but did you show it to him?

01:23:38.179 --> 01:23:39.680
No.

01:23:39.764 --> 01:23:41.849
Did you not tell Evans

01:23:41.933 --> 01:23:44.226
that you had been doing training
in medical matters

01:23:44.310 --> 01:23:45.561
before the war

01:23:45.645 --> 01:23:47.688
and that you stopped
because of an accident?

01:23:47.772 --> 01:23:49.857
No.

01:23:49.941 --> 01:23:52.359
You gave evidence yesterday

01:23:52.444 --> 01:23:57.072
that during the night
of Tuesday the 8th of November,

01:23:57.157 --> 01:23:58.741
you heard a thud.

01:23:58.825 --> 01:24:00.659
Yes.

01:24:00.744 --> 01:24:04.204
Uh, it seemed rather loud.

01:24:04.289 --> 01:24:08.459
It startled us rather.
It woke us up.

01:24:08.543 --> 01:24:10.544
This was about midnight?

01:24:10.628 --> 01:24:12.337
Uh, yes, it would be.

01:24:12.422 --> 01:24:14.965
Are you quite sure
about that?

01:24:15.050 --> 01:24:16.800
Absolutely certain.

01:24:16.885 --> 01:24:19.887
Do you remember
giving evidence

01:24:19.971 --> 01:24:23.223
at the magistrate's court
at West London?

01:24:23.308 --> 01:24:24.433
Yes.

01:24:24.517 --> 01:24:26.393
You never mentioned there
this noise

01:24:26.478 --> 01:24:28.312
of something very heavy
being moved,

01:24:28.396 --> 01:24:29.646
did you?

01:24:29.731 --> 01:24:32.316
Oh, yes, I did mention it.
I'm certain.

01:24:32.400 --> 01:24:36.153
Well, perhaps
it was not taken down.

01:24:37.989 --> 01:24:41.033
What happened after the sound
of furniture moving?

01:24:41.117 --> 01:24:44.244
I, um ‒
I-I went off to sleep again.

01:24:44.329 --> 01:24:48.665
Because of the pain I was having
with the fibrositis,

01:24:48.750 --> 01:24:50.751
I was taking tablets.

01:24:50.835 --> 01:24:53.003
It was the only way
I could get to sleep.

01:24:53.088 --> 01:24:55.297
I'm still taking them,
as a matter of fact.

01:24:55.381 --> 01:25:00.135
Are you still suffering
from fibrositis, Mr. Christie?

01:25:00.220 --> 01:25:01.637
Very badly, my lord.

01:25:01.721 --> 01:25:04.014
I was in severe pain
all night.

01:25:04.099 --> 01:25:07.101
I had to go to the doctor
again last night,

01:25:07.185 --> 01:25:08.769
and he prescribed for me

01:25:08.853 --> 01:25:11.980
and gave me some pills
to alleviate the pain.

01:25:12.065 --> 01:25:14.733
But I was awake
for most of the night.

01:25:14.818 --> 01:25:16.527
Would you be more comfortable

01:25:16.611 --> 01:25:18.779
giving your evidence
sitting down?

01:25:18.863 --> 01:25:22.866
Well, yes, I think I would, my lord.

01:25:22.951 --> 01:25:26.703
Then you may.

01:25:26.788 --> 01:25:28.330
Thank you.

01:25:42.262 --> 01:25:43.679
Mr. Christie...

01:25:43.763 --> 01:25:46.431
yesterday you remember
Mr. Humphreys asking you

01:25:46.516 --> 01:25:50.018
if you had been in the police
force during the last war?

01:25:50.103 --> 01:25:51.478
Yes.

01:25:51.563 --> 01:25:54.481
In fact, you were a constable
in the war reserve?

01:25:54.566 --> 01:25:56.024
For four years, yes.

01:25:56.109 --> 01:25:59.736
But you are not, are you,
a man of good character?

01:26:04.576 --> 01:26:08.662
Well, I...have had some trouble.

01:26:08.746 --> 01:26:11.248
I apologize for having to ask
you these questions,

01:26:11.332 --> 01:26:13.333
but I'm afraid I must.

01:26:13.418 --> 01:26:16.086
On four occasions
you have been convicted

01:26:16.171 --> 01:26:18.672
of offenses of dishonesty,
haven't you?

01:26:18.756 --> 01:26:21.091
Uh, three.

01:26:21.176 --> 01:26:22.593
Not four?

01:26:25.305 --> 01:26:29.308
Then perhaps
I had better put them to you.

01:26:29.392 --> 01:26:30.851
Were you sentenced

01:26:30.935 --> 01:26:33.312
to three months'
imprisonment in 1921

01:26:33.396 --> 01:26:35.022
for stealing postal orders?

01:26:35.106 --> 01:26:37.608
Yes.

01:26:37.692 --> 01:26:43.197
Bound over for false pretenses
in 1923 at Halifax?

01:26:43.281 --> 01:26:45.199
Yes, I remember that.

01:26:45.283 --> 01:26:49.036
Nine months hard labor
for stealing material and goods

01:26:49.120 --> 01:26:51.538
in 1924 at Uxbridge?

01:26:51.623 --> 01:26:53.081
Yes.

01:26:53.166 --> 01:26:55.542
And three months
also at Uxbridge

01:26:55.627 --> 01:26:58.045
for stealing a motorcar
in 1933?

01:26:58.129 --> 01:27:00.589
Yes, that's right.

01:27:00.673 --> 01:27:02.841
Well, surely
you could remember that ‒

01:27:02.926 --> 01:27:04.384
four offenses for dishonesty.

01:27:04.469 --> 01:27:08.764
Well, I-I ‒
I had an idea it was three.

01:27:08.848 --> 01:27:13.977
I-I just didn't ‒
I just wasn't quite sure.

01:27:14.062 --> 01:27:16.605
I see.

01:27:16.689 --> 01:27:19.399
But what is perhaps
more important ‒

01:27:19.484 --> 01:27:21.735
and relevant to this matter ‒

01:27:21.819 --> 01:27:25.530
are there two other convictions
recorded against you?

01:27:28.201 --> 01:27:29.785
Yes.

01:27:29.869 --> 01:27:33.497
The first of these being
for violence

01:27:33.581 --> 01:27:35.415
at Halifax in 1923?

01:27:35.500 --> 01:27:38.669
Yes.

01:27:38.753 --> 01:27:42.923
And the second when
you were sentenced to six months

01:27:43.007 --> 01:27:45.634
for malicious wounding
in 1929?

01:27:45.718 --> 01:27:47.386
Yes.

01:27:48.972 --> 01:27:51.556
Yes.

01:27:58.064 --> 01:27:59.606
Do you appreciate

01:27:59.691 --> 01:28:02.484
that the medical evidence
in this case

01:28:02.568 --> 01:28:04.319
which has been called

01:28:04.404 --> 01:28:06.989
is that
this woman was strangled?

01:28:09.075 --> 01:28:10.492
I was informed of that.

01:28:10.576 --> 01:28:12.744
Not killed by abortion,
of which there's no sign,

01:28:12.829 --> 01:28:15.539
but by strangulation?

01:28:15.623 --> 01:28:16.665
Yes.

01:28:16.749 --> 01:28:18.000
Now...

01:28:18.084 --> 01:28:20.669
a word about your character.

01:28:20.753 --> 01:28:24.798
What were you doing
in the First World War?

01:28:24.882 --> 01:28:28.051
I was in the army
in the First World War.

01:28:28.136 --> 01:28:31.680
Fighting for your country?

01:28:31.764 --> 01:28:34.308
Yes. I-I was gassed twice.

01:28:34.392 --> 01:28:37.728
I was blinded
for three months,

01:28:37.812 --> 01:28:41.398
and I never spoke
for 31/2 years.

01:28:43.067 --> 01:28:46.820
The last time you were
in trouble with the police

01:28:46.904 --> 01:28:49.823
for any offense was in 1933,
was it?

01:28:49.907 --> 01:28:51.408
Yes.

01:28:52.452 --> 01:28:54.578
17 years ago.

01:28:54.662 --> 01:28:55.996
Yes.

01:28:56.080 --> 01:28:59.499
In this last war,
in spite of your disabilities,

01:28:59.584 --> 01:29:02.502
you served
in the war reserve police

01:29:02.587 --> 01:29:04.171
for many years.

01:29:04.255 --> 01:29:05.797
Is that right?

01:29:05.882 --> 01:29:07.507
Yes, I did,

01:29:07.592 --> 01:29:11.094
and I was commended
on two occasions.

01:29:11.179 --> 01:29:14.473
Thank you, Mr. Christie.

01:29:26.110 --> 01:29:29.112
What are you doing?

01:29:29.197 --> 01:29:32.657
I'm going to sleep
in the front room.

01:29:34.786 --> 01:29:36.244
Front room?

01:29:36.329 --> 01:29:38.372
On the sofa from now on.

01:29:38.456 --> 01:29:40.582
What's that in aid of?

01:29:40.666 --> 01:29:44.461
Nothing, it's just that
I'm not sleeping very well,

01:29:44.545 --> 01:29:46.171
that's all.

01:29:54.764 --> 01:29:59.017
Now, it is you who voluntarily
go to the police

01:29:59.102 --> 01:30:01.144
on the 30th of November

01:30:01.229 --> 01:30:06.483
after hearing about the telegram
which your aunt had received

01:30:06.567 --> 01:30:09.569
from Mr. Thorley,
your wife's father?

01:30:09.654 --> 01:30:11.780
That's right.

01:30:11.864 --> 01:30:13.448
It was because

01:30:13.533 --> 01:30:15.659
your previous lies were exposed
by the telegram

01:30:15.743 --> 01:30:18.412
that you decided to go
to the police, was it?

01:30:18.496 --> 01:30:20.205
It wasn't because of the lies.

01:30:20.289 --> 01:30:22.791
Then why did you suddenly
go to the police?

01:30:22.875 --> 01:30:28.088
Well...I was getting worried
about my daughter.

01:30:28.172 --> 01:30:31.550
Are you saying that seriously
to the jury ‒

01:30:31.634 --> 01:30:35.929
that you go to the police
and confess to murder

01:30:36.013 --> 01:30:39.057
because you're worried
about your daughter?

01:30:39.142 --> 01:30:41.560
There is no confession
of murder.

01:30:41.644 --> 01:30:44.271
He said,
"I have disposed of my wife.

01:30:44.355 --> 01:30:46.606
I have put her
down the drain."

01:30:46.691 --> 01:30:50.360
It sounds very like murder.

01:30:52.697 --> 01:30:55.073
All he said was
he had put her ‒

01:30:55.158 --> 01:30:58.201
it might well be her body ‒
down the drain.

01:31:00.538 --> 01:31:03.832
You made a statement
to the police,

01:31:03.916 --> 01:31:07.169
and this is
the first you made ‒

01:31:07.253 --> 01:31:08.795
Exhibit 6 ‒

01:31:08.880 --> 01:31:13.258
in which you talk
of meeting a man in a café,

01:31:13.342 --> 01:31:17.345
and of how your wife
took these pills

01:31:17.430 --> 01:31:21.641
and died of them
and you found her dead.

01:31:21.726 --> 01:31:23.935
You remember that statement?

01:31:24.020 --> 01:31:26.855
Yes, I remember that statement.

01:31:26.939 --> 01:31:29.608
That is untrue?

01:31:29.692 --> 01:31:32.319
That is untrue, yes.

01:31:32.403 --> 01:31:34.154
You then made a statement

01:31:34.238 --> 01:31:36.406
in which you set out
in some detail

01:31:36.491 --> 01:31:38.867
how Mr. Christie
gave your wife something

01:31:38.951 --> 01:31:40.869
which would cause
an abortion

01:31:40.953 --> 01:31:42.954
and she died of that.

01:31:43.039 --> 01:31:45.248
Do you remember that one?

01:31:45.333 --> 01:31:49.002
Yes, I remember that one, too.

01:31:49.086 --> 01:31:52.547
Is that one true or untrue?

01:31:52.632 --> 01:31:54.674
That is true.

01:31:54.759 --> 01:31:56.676
Then you made a statement

01:31:56.761 --> 01:31:59.721
in which you confess
to murdering your wife

01:31:59.805 --> 01:32:01.473
and your child.

01:32:01.557 --> 01:32:03.683
Is that true or untrue?

01:32:03.768 --> 01:32:06.686
I was told
of my daughter's death

01:32:06.771 --> 01:32:08.772
before I made that one.

01:32:08.856 --> 01:32:10.065
True or untrue?

01:32:14.403 --> 01:32:17.906
I-It is true I made the statement.

01:32:17.990 --> 01:32:20.992
Is the statement
true or untrue?

01:32:23.329 --> 01:32:25.455
Untrue.

01:32:25.540 --> 01:32:27.332
So then that is

01:32:27.416 --> 01:32:30.544
the second statement
you have made to the police,

01:32:30.628 --> 01:32:33.296
in some detail,
which is untrue?

01:32:35.675 --> 01:32:37.259
Yes.

01:32:37.343 --> 01:32:40.762
So would it not be right to say
that you are a person

01:32:40.846 --> 01:32:43.431
who's prepared to lie,
or tell the truth,

01:32:43.516 --> 01:32:45.183
at your own convenience?

01:32:45.268 --> 01:32:47.519
Well, why should I tell lies?

01:32:47.603 --> 01:32:49.521
My life is at stake here.

01:32:49.605 --> 01:32:52.148
Now...

01:32:52.233 --> 01:32:55.902
we have shown that your story
about Mr. Christie

01:32:55.987 --> 01:32:59.114
giving your wife an abortion
is nonsense.

01:32:59.198 --> 01:33:00.949
You are the person

01:33:01.033 --> 01:33:03.827
who alleges Mr. Christie
is the murderer in this case.

01:33:03.911 --> 01:33:05.579
Can you suggest why

01:33:05.663 --> 01:33:08.623
he should have strangled
your wife?

01:33:12.920 --> 01:33:18.925
Well...he was...

01:33:19.010 --> 01:33:21.428
home all day.

01:33:21.512 --> 01:33:22.929
Can you suggest why

01:33:23.014 --> 01:33:25.015
he should have strangled
your wife?

01:33:33.024 --> 01:33:35.317
No, I can't.

01:33:35.401 --> 01:33:37.277
Can you suggest why

01:33:37.361 --> 01:33:41.197
he should have strangled
your daughter?

01:33:48.956 --> 01:33:51.082
No.

01:33:53.502 --> 01:33:55.420
I didn't do it, Auntie.

01:33:55.504 --> 01:33:57.130
Christie done it.

01:33:57.214 --> 01:34:00.133
I didn't even know
the baby was dead

01:34:00.217 --> 01:34:04.012
till the police brought me in
to Notting Hill.

01:34:04.096 --> 01:34:07.599
Well, Christie said
she was in East Acton.

01:34:07.683 --> 01:34:10.977
Get Christie ‒
Get him here to see me.

01:34:11.062 --> 01:34:14.356
He's the only one
who can help me now.

01:34:24.116 --> 01:34:26.743
Timothy John Evans...

01:34:26.827 --> 01:34:30.121
the court has found you guilty
of willful murder,

01:34:30.206 --> 01:34:32.832
and the sentence of the court
upon you

01:34:32.917 --> 01:34:35.460
is that you be taken
from this place

01:34:35.544 --> 01:34:37.003
to a lawful prison,

01:34:37.088 --> 01:34:39.339
and thence to a place
of execution,

01:34:39.423 --> 01:34:42.300
and there you will suffer death
by hanging.

01:34:42.385 --> 01:34:44.386
And that your body be buried

01:34:44.470 --> 01:34:47.097
within the precincts
of the prison

01:34:47.181 --> 01:34:50.100
in which you shall have been
last confined

01:34:50.184 --> 01:34:51.935
before your execution.

01:34:52.019 --> 01:34:55.188
And may the Lord have mercy
on your soul.

01:34:55.272 --> 01:34:56.815
Amen.

01:35:33.644 --> 01:35:36.563
The one thing
that sticks in my mind

01:35:36.647 --> 01:35:40.108
is I'm in for something
I haven't done, sir.

01:35:40.192 --> 01:35:41.901
You must remember, Evans,

01:35:41.986 --> 01:35:43.945
that we're not here
to go into

01:35:44.029 --> 01:35:46.072
the rights and wrongs
of your case.

01:35:46.157 --> 01:35:48.158
This is purely
a medical board.

01:35:48.242 --> 01:35:52.746
Yes, I know that, sir.

01:35:52.830 --> 01:35:57.000
See...Christie done it.

01:35:57.084 --> 01:36:00.003
You confessed
at Notting Hill.

01:36:00.087 --> 01:36:01.671
Why was that?

01:36:01.756 --> 01:36:03.673
I broke down at Notting Hill.

01:36:03.758 --> 01:36:06.342
Well, I had nothing else
to worry about

01:36:06.427 --> 01:36:08.678
when I knew my daughter
was dead.

01:36:08.763 --> 01:36:12.056
Why do you think your daughter
was killed?

01:36:14.351 --> 01:36:19.355
Well...to be out of the way,
wasn't it?

01:36:19.440 --> 01:36:21.816
I see.

01:36:21.901 --> 01:36:23.860
Any further questions?

01:36:23.944 --> 01:36:25.779
No.

01:36:25.863 --> 01:36:28.531
All right, thank you.

01:36:30.993 --> 01:36:34.537
Come along then.

01:36:34.622 --> 01:36:37.165
B-But Christie done it!

01:36:37.249 --> 01:36:42.045
I say Christie done it!
All right, all right.

01:36:44.381 --> 01:36:46.049
Well, I don't know ‒

01:36:46.133 --> 01:36:48.343
He's not
an unpleasing little fellow.

01:36:48.427 --> 01:36:49.928
Oh, no.

01:36:50.012 --> 01:36:51.805
Primitive sort
of creature,

01:36:51.889 --> 01:36:54.349
but nothing abnormal ‒
medically speaking.

01:36:54.433 --> 01:36:56.726
Rather nicer than average
I thought.

01:36:56.811 --> 01:36:58.019
Yes.

01:36:58.103 --> 01:37:01.147
Nothing very much at all,
really.

01:37:01.232 --> 01:37:05.068
Certainly no medical grounds
for a reprieve.

01:38:06.297 --> 01:38:08.339
Oh!

01:39:01.685 --> 01:39:05.647
Supper's in the meat safe.

01:39:05.731 --> 01:39:07.857
I should have thought

01:39:07.942 --> 01:39:11.611
you could have got it
for yourself.

01:39:11.695 --> 01:39:13.947
I'm going to bed now.

01:39:14.031 --> 01:39:16.908
I've taken a sleeping pill.

01:39:16.992 --> 01:39:20.370
I'm going to Sheffield
in the morning.

01:39:23.165 --> 01:39:24.374
Sheffield?

01:39:24.458 --> 01:39:26.417
To stay with Jessy and Bob.

01:39:26.502 --> 01:39:28.795
You can't just leave me here.

01:39:28.879 --> 01:39:31.047
I-I can't stand Jessy,
you know that.

01:39:31.131 --> 01:39:32.924
She talks too much.

01:39:33.008 --> 01:39:36.010
What am I meant to do then?

01:39:36.095 --> 01:39:39.430
We've no friends.

01:39:39.515 --> 01:39:43.059
Not a soul set foot
in this house

01:39:43.143 --> 01:39:45.478
for two years nearly.

01:39:45.562 --> 01:39:47.647
Not since the Evanses.

01:39:47.731 --> 01:39:49.232
We've no money ‒

01:39:49.316 --> 01:39:51.401
You haven't worked since
I don't know when.

01:39:51.485 --> 01:39:52.986
I can't work, can I?

01:39:53.070 --> 01:39:55.196
Not with my back
and everything.

01:39:55.280 --> 01:39:57.407
The doctor says
I should be in hospital.

01:39:57.491 --> 01:40:00.159
I know where you should be.

01:40:00.244 --> 01:40:03.121
What's that
supposed to mean?

01:40:03.205 --> 01:40:05.456
You know what I mean.

01:41:22.951 --> 01:41:25.119
Ohh.

01:41:27.456 --> 01:41:29.832
Ohh.

01:42:14.461 --> 01:42:17.296
You don't mind, do you?

01:42:32.980 --> 01:42:35.106
It's migraine.

01:42:35.190 --> 01:42:36.107
Hmm.

01:42:36.191 --> 01:42:37.650
I get these terrible headaches.

01:42:37.734 --> 01:42:39.652
Very unpleasant,
very unpleasant.

01:42:39.736 --> 01:42:41.779
Mind you, um...

01:42:41.864 --> 01:42:43.698
medically speaking,
of course,

01:42:43.782 --> 01:42:46.033
it's a very interesting
condition ‒

01:42:46.118 --> 01:42:49.370
"syndrome" as we call it.

01:42:49.454 --> 01:42:52.331
You're not a doctor,
are you?

01:42:52.416 --> 01:42:55.751
Well,
now how did you know that?

01:42:55.836 --> 01:42:58.254
Well, I should say I was.

01:42:58.338 --> 01:42:59.797
Was?

01:42:59.882 --> 01:43:03.301
Yes, I, um...
I did a favor for a friend ‒

01:43:03.385 --> 01:43:05.052
a lady friend ‒

01:43:05.137 --> 01:43:06.762
I expect you understand.

01:43:06.847 --> 01:43:08.139
You know how it is.

01:43:08.223 --> 01:43:09.557
Oh, yes.

01:43:09.641 --> 01:43:10.850
Oh, dear.

01:43:10.934 --> 01:43:12.768
Can I get you another cup
of tea?

01:43:12.853 --> 01:43:14.687
No, thanks.

01:43:14.771 --> 01:43:17.023
Are you sure?

01:43:17.107 --> 01:43:19.358
Yes, well, of course, uh,

01:43:19.443 --> 01:43:21.819
they won't do you any good,
mind.

01:43:21.904 --> 01:43:23.529
What does, though?

01:43:23.614 --> 01:43:26.324
Ah, well,
if only I was free to, uh...

01:43:28.410 --> 01:43:30.912
Honestly, I'd do anything.

01:44:08.325 --> 01:44:11.077
Well, you certainly do yourself
proud in here, I must say.

01:44:11.161 --> 01:44:12.578
My wife's away.

01:44:12.663 --> 01:44:14.080
I don't blame her.

01:44:14.164 --> 01:44:16.207
You can keep that mattress
for a start.

01:44:16.291 --> 01:44:18.251
It'd have the whole shop
running alive.

01:44:18.335 --> 01:44:19.752
What's that mean?

01:44:19.836 --> 01:44:21.003
Bedbugs.

01:44:21.088 --> 01:44:23.214
L-Look, this is mahogany ‒
pure mahogany.

01:44:23.298 --> 01:44:24.757
Oh, yeah.
10 quid the lot.

01:44:24.841 --> 01:44:26.342
What, for everything?

01:44:26.426 --> 01:44:28.844
Everything, bar that mattress ‒
It'll walk out by itself.

01:44:28.929 --> 01:44:31.555
10 pounds ‒ I ‒
Surely it must be worth 15.

01:44:31.640 --> 01:44:33.516
Not to me, it isn't.

01:44:33.600 --> 01:44:36.852
Well, I-I can't work.
I was wounded in the war.

01:44:36.937 --> 01:44:39.730
That's tough luck, squire.

01:44:39.815 --> 01:44:42.692
12's my top.
Yes or no?

01:44:42.776 --> 01:44:44.068
All right.

01:44:44.152 --> 01:44:46.279
I'll have the van around
this afternoon.

01:44:46.363 --> 01:44:50.324
1...2...3...

01:45:31.033 --> 01:45:34.493
I was, uh,
just looking through my papers.

01:45:34.578 --> 01:45:37.872
Cuttings and things ‒
newspaper cuttings.

01:45:37.956 --> 01:45:41.250
I was in all the papers
a few years back.

01:45:43.587 --> 01:45:49.967
Murder trial it was ‒
A dreadful business, appalling.

01:45:50.052 --> 01:45:54.555
Of course,
I was in the police once,

01:45:54.639 --> 01:45:58.142
so I understand these things.

01:46:01.438 --> 01:46:05.232
I have had a very...

01:46:05.317 --> 01:46:08.152
varied life.

01:46:10.739 --> 01:46:12.239
Funny, really.

01:46:14.368 --> 01:46:17.036
In all the papers
a few years back,

01:46:17.120 --> 01:46:19.246
and now...

01:46:19.331 --> 01:46:21.707
Pigs.

01:46:26.213 --> 01:46:28.172
Well, of course,

01:46:28.256 --> 01:46:32.218
if that's the way
you're going to talk...

01:46:32.302 --> 01:46:34.804
It's what I'd expect,
of course.

01:46:51.196 --> 01:46:53.447
Okay, just dump it here.

01:46:54.991 --> 01:46:57.076
Really smells bad in here.

01:46:57.160 --> 01:46:59.703
We'll soon get it cleaned up.

01:47:53.967 --> 01:47:55.134
Cliff...

01:47:55.218 --> 01:47:56.677
Hmm?

01:47:56.761 --> 01:47:58.596
Go and get the police.

01:48:55.987 --> 01:48:59.490
What are you doing,
looking for work?

01:49:01.618 --> 01:49:05.454
My employment cards
haven't come through.

01:49:05.539 --> 01:49:07.540
Well, what's your name?

01:49:07.624 --> 01:49:09.291
John Waddington.

01:49:09.376 --> 01:49:12.545
Have you got anything on you
to prove your identity?

01:49:12.629 --> 01:49:14.463
No, nothing at all.

01:49:14.548 --> 01:49:17.132
Take your hat off, will you?

01:49:29.312 --> 01:49:31.146
You're Christie.

01:49:31.231 --> 01:49:33.691
John Reginald Christie.

01:49:36.111 --> 01:49:39.363
I shall have to take you
into custody.

01:49:39.447 --> 01:49:41.323
Come along.
