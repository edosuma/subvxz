WEBVTT

00:08.500 --> 00:11.600
- You could live here.
- Are you asking me?

00:11.900 --> 00:14.800
- Would you like to?
- Would you like me to?

00:15.100 --> 00:17.900
- Yeah.
- Then I will.

00:18.100 --> 00:22.300
I gave the greatest speech
of my condo-board career,

00:22.700 --> 00:25.100
which lead to a vote, which lead
to the ruling that Cam Winston

00:25.400 --> 00:29.400
must now park that SUV monstrosity
of his in the sub-basement.

00:29.900 --> 00:32.800
You think that's smart, ticking off
the guy who lives right above us?

00:33.200 --> 00:35.700
- Well, the move's off.
- What?

00:35.900 --> 00:38.400
Just temporarily.
My parents are coming for a visit.

00:38.600 --> 00:40.700
Just to clarify,
you're going to stay here,

00:41.000 --> 00:42.800
but your parents
are going to stay with me.

00:43.100 --> 00:45.100
I'm so glad you understand.

00:45.900 --> 00:47.200
If she thinks you're a virgin,

00:47.400 --> 00:49.600
how are you going to explain
our plan to live together?

00:50.000 --> 00:53.300
I wonder how important it is
that she ever finds out.

00:53.500 --> 00:55.600
- Dad scarpered.
- He left?

00:55.900 --> 00:57.500
Yeah.
- It's true.

00:58.000 --> 01:01.600
Thank goodness I have my children
to lean upon.

01:01.900 --> 01:02.900
Oh, don't cry, Mum.

01:03.200 --> 01:06.200
I really thought this junket to America
would cheer you up.

01:06.500 --> 01:09.400
It still can.
Get out there and see the country.

01:09.800 --> 01:13.200
Yes, immerse yourself in the spectacle
and the grandeur

01:13.500 --> 01:17.700
that are these United States,
this America.

01:20.400 --> 01:21.700
How did you do that?

01:22.200 --> 01:24.800
Cam Winston!

01:28.100 --> 01:30.100
It was a good idea,
taking Mum out today.

01:30.400 --> 01:32.300
- Helped take her mind off Dad.
- Yeah.

01:32.600 --> 01:35.800
Though I'm not sure the zoo
was the best idea.

01:36.100 --> 01:39.600
The sight of those amorous wolverines
seemed to set her back a bit.

01:40.300 --> 01:43.200
Amorous? I thought
they were trying to kill each other.

01:43.900 --> 01:46.900
Well, either way,
it seemed to remind her of something.

01:49.700 --> 01:53.000
Hello, Mrs. Moon.
Would you care for a bite to eat?

01:53.400 --> 01:57.500
Oh, that would be lovely, if I thought
I could keep anything down.

01:58.600 --> 02:01.600
How could your father do this to me?

02:01.900 --> 02:04.700
You sleep down the hall from someone
for 40 years,

02:05.000 --> 02:07.100
you think you know them...

02:08.100 --> 02:09.699
I know you're upset, Mum,

02:09.800 --> 02:12.300
but it's not like you and Dad
had a perfect marriage.

02:12.600 --> 02:14.600
That's because
there's no such thing.

02:14.800 --> 02:15.900
You young, modern people

02:16.200 --> 02:19.900
think marriage is some sort of
promenade through paradise,

02:20.300 --> 02:23.200
when it's more like a march through
hell with a man strapped to your back

02:23.500 --> 02:26.900
and a litter of nasty babies
swinging from your teats.

02:28.300 --> 02:31.700
Yeah, obviously this is
a very upsetting time for all of us.

02:32.000 --> 02:34.200
But remember,
tomorrow is another day.

02:34.500 --> 02:35.800
You're right, dear.

02:36.000 --> 02:38.700
And the sooner you get home to bed,
the sooner it'll be here.

02:38.900 --> 02:39.900
But it's only 9:30.

02:40.200 --> 02:43.900
And with every tick of the clock,
your womanly resistance weakens.

02:44.100 --> 02:46.000
And before you know it,
he'll be on top of you

02:46.200 --> 02:49.100
like one of those bloody badgers
at the zoo.

02:51.700 --> 02:53.200
Actually, those were wolverines,

02:53.500 --> 02:56.100
and there's a chance
they may have been fighting.

02:56.800 --> 02:59.500
It has been a long day.
Maybe it's best if I leave.

02:59.800 --> 03:01.000
- All right.
- Yeah.

03:01.200 --> 03:03.400
I'll see you tomorrow, Mum.

03:06.000 --> 03:08.400
- Good night, Niles.
- Good night.

03:10.000 --> 03:16.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:21.800 --> 03:24.100
Well, hey, you still up?

03:24.500 --> 03:26.200
Can't sleep.

03:27.100 --> 03:29.200
Every time I look outside,

03:29.900 --> 03:33.300
I feel like I'm living inside
a giant clown's pocket.

03:35.000 --> 03:37.700
I tell you, Cam Winston
has not heard the last of this.

03:37.900 --> 03:40.800
I am calling an emergency meeting
of the condo board tomorrow morning.

03:41.100 --> 03:44.100
You can't fight this, Fras. It'll just
look like you're attacking the flag.

03:44.400 --> 03:47.200
I'm not attacking the flag.
Cam is using the flag to attack me.

03:47.500 --> 03:49.000
You're right,
but you're still gonna lose.

03:49.300 --> 03:51.500
But the building has bylaws
about this sort of thing.

03:51.800 --> 03:53.400
If this was anything
but the American flag,

03:53.700 --> 03:55.500
people would demand
that it be taken down.

03:55.900 --> 03:58.700
Face it, Fras,
Cam's got you on this one.

03:58.900 --> 04:02.200
- Boy, I have to say, that guy is smart.
- Oh, really?

04:02.600 --> 04:05.900
If he's so smart and you're so smart,
why don't you two live together?

04:08.400 --> 04:10.500
At least he's got a view.

04:13.500 --> 04:15.900
What on earth
do you think you're doing?

04:16.100 --> 04:18.300
Oh, sorry.
I didn't know you was here.

04:18.600 --> 04:21.700
Oh, Frasier, this is Loretta.

04:21.899 --> 04:24.900
Loretta...
Well, you know who you are.

04:28.400 --> 04:30.600
I love your curtains.

04:33.000 --> 04:35.300
I'm sorry, but we are not
entertaining guests this evening.

04:35.600 --> 04:37.100
You'll have to leave.

04:37.400 --> 04:39.900
Wait. You told me
this was your place.

04:40.200 --> 04:42.400
You're probably
not even the duke of England.

04:42.700 --> 04:45.600
Oh, yeah?
Then why do I talk this way?

04:48.200 --> 04:52.200
Well, you're just a big contraceptive,
aren't you?

04:55.100 --> 04:57.500
I've just about had it
with you, Simon.

04:57.800 --> 05:02.300
You have blown my speakers,
you have clogged my Jacuzzi

05:02.600 --> 05:06.500
and you have ingested
half of my bath products.

05:06.900 --> 05:08.600
You are no longer welcome
in my home.

05:08.900 --> 05:12.300
- What exactly are you implying?
- Get out!

05:13.500 --> 05:16.100
Fras, you can't throw him out.
Where's he gonna go?

05:16.300 --> 05:18.600
Oh, he'll land on his feet.

05:18.900 --> 05:22.300
Probably end up shacking up
with some two-bit floozy.

05:26.100 --> 05:27.800
Simon.

05:29.700 --> 05:32.100
- What are you doing here?
- Hello, love.

05:32.800 --> 05:37.000
It appears that the front door
to the building is locked.

05:37.300 --> 05:40.100
Yeah, that's how we keep drunks
from wandering in.

05:40.500 --> 05:43.500
Well, I seem to be without appropriate
accommodation at the moment.

05:43.700 --> 05:46.500
I just thought I'd take you up
on your kind and generous offer.

05:46.700 --> 05:48.600
I never said you could stay here.

05:48.900 --> 05:50.800
Well, Frasier's thrown me out.

05:51.000 --> 05:52.900
All right, well,
sleep in Martin's Winnebago.

05:53.200 --> 05:55.600
Well, wouldn't I love to do that,
but when I got down there,

05:55.800 --> 05:59.100
there was this gigantic Humvee
blocking the door.

05:59.700 --> 06:01.700
Simon, this isn't my problem.

06:02.000 --> 06:04.000
- Well...
- You have got to go.

06:04.200 --> 06:07.300
Look, Roz, I'll level with you.

06:07.700 --> 06:10.100
I know that we've had
a chequered history,

06:10.500 --> 06:14.800
and I'm probably not the sort of person
that you'd want in your house.

06:15.800 --> 06:18.400
But I'm asking for your help.

06:18.900 --> 06:22.200
As a friend. As Daphne's brother.

06:22.600 --> 06:26.600
Please, just let me stay one night.

06:27.000 --> 06:28.400
You won't even notice me.

06:28.500 --> 06:32.800
Just the tiniest spot on the floor
would be a gift.

06:33.200 --> 06:36.100
Look, I'll be gone in the morning.
I'll never darken your doorstep again.

06:36.500 --> 06:41.400
Please, Roz,
I've got nowhere else to go.

06:44.100 --> 06:46.700
All right.
I'll make up the couch for you.

06:47.000 --> 06:50.600
Oh, thank you, Roz.
You have got a good heart.

06:50.900 --> 06:52.000
Yeah.

06:52.200 --> 06:55.600
Climb on up, Suzy. We're golden.

06:57.200 --> 06:59.200
She can swing on a pole
for two hours,

06:59.500 --> 07:02.600
but she can't climb up a drainpipe
to save her life.

07:04.500 --> 07:06.300
Hey, what...?

07:07.300 --> 07:09.900
Heads up, Suzy!

07:11.400 --> 07:12.900
Two, please.

07:13.500 --> 07:14.500
Thank you.

07:16.600 --> 07:18.100
Well, show us what you got.

07:18.400 --> 07:23.200
I've got a king, a jack,
a ten and two sixes.

07:26.000 --> 07:29.700
- Two sixes, then.
- And a king.

07:31.100 --> 07:33.700
I'm sorry, love.
I've got aces over deuces.

07:33.900 --> 07:36.400
Well, that's the last of
my mad money.

07:36.700 --> 07:39.100
I guess I'll have to win it back
some other night.

07:39.500 --> 07:42.300
You better make it soon.
I won't be around much longer.

07:42.500 --> 07:45.700
Not if you keep biting those filters off,
you won't.

07:45.900 --> 07:49.500
No. I mean I'll be going back
to England soon.

07:49.900 --> 07:51.900
Well, it's nice enough here.

07:52.200 --> 07:55.500
But you and Daphne aren't
the most exciting people, are you?

07:56.900 --> 08:00.600
No, as soon as I've sorted myself out,
Simon and I are back on the plane.

08:00.900 --> 08:04.100
Really? You are?
Uh, can I do anything to help sort?

08:04.700 --> 08:06.200
Thank you, no.

08:07.100 --> 08:09.200
Oh, the shock's worn off, really.

08:09.500 --> 08:11.500
And I've come to realise
I've spent most of my life

08:11.800 --> 08:13.900
taking care of a layabout husband.

08:14.200 --> 08:17.100
Well, now it's my turn
to be taken care of.

08:17.300 --> 08:19.300
Thank God I've got Simon.

08:24.400 --> 08:27.700
- Simon's gonna be taking care of you?
- Oh, of course he will.

08:28.000 --> 08:32.200
I know he plays the fool sometimes,
but he'd never let me down.

08:32.900 --> 08:36.299
Well, you've made a lot of progress
in a short amount of time,

08:36.600 --> 08:39.500
and I can't tell you how happy I am.

08:39.799 --> 08:41.600
Oh. Heh.

08:41.799 --> 08:43.700
You good for a few more hands?

08:44.000 --> 08:46.400
Why not? Oh, I'm out of money.

08:46.700 --> 08:49.700
Oh, not to worry.
We can play for rubs.

08:50.800 --> 08:53.500
Oh! I'll get my coin collection.

09:04.900 --> 09:07.300
Still awake, Dr. Crane?

09:07.900 --> 09:09.500
Yes.

09:09.800 --> 09:12.200
It's almost dawn's early light,

09:13.300 --> 09:15.500
and our flag is still there.

09:20.000 --> 09:25.300
Daphne,
as a subject of the British realm,

09:26.000 --> 09:27.900
does it make you feel uncomfortable

09:28.100 --> 09:31.800
to have your residence draped
in the American flag?

09:32.200 --> 09:35.400
And, if so, would you be willing
to say that at a condo-board meeting?

09:36.200 --> 09:38.100
Personally, I find it a cosy reminder

09:38.300 --> 09:41.600
of the land I dreamed of living in
as a child.

09:47.800 --> 09:48.800
Off I go.

09:58.100 --> 10:00.700
Simon, I thought
Dr. Crane kicked you out.

10:01.100 --> 10:04.200
- He did. You don't see me.
- What are you doing here?

10:04.400 --> 10:08.200
Well, I'm just getting
some provisions for my trip.

10:08.700 --> 10:09.700
What trip?

10:09.900 --> 10:12.700
Well, I just thought I'd go
meet some mates in California.

10:13.100 --> 10:15.400
You can't run out on Mum.
She's counting on you.

10:15.700 --> 10:17.100
She's got the other boys back home.

10:17.200 --> 10:18.900
They've all sided with Dad.
You know that.

10:19.200 --> 10:20.200
You're all she's got.

10:20.500 --> 10:24.200
I'm not cut out to take care of Mum.
She's too demanding.

10:24.500 --> 10:26.800
She turned Dad
into a shiftless drinker.

10:27.100 --> 10:29.600
I can't have her doing that to me.

10:32.000 --> 10:35.000
So you're gonna leave in the middle
of the night and not even tell her?

10:35.300 --> 10:37.600
Look, if you wanna take care of Mum,
that's your choice,

10:37.900 --> 10:39.700
but I've got to live my life.

10:40.000 --> 10:41.300
You are so selfish.

10:41.500 --> 10:44.300
For once in your life,
you have a chance to be responsible.

10:44.600 --> 10:46.500
Be a man. Do right by your family.

10:46.800 --> 10:50.600
Why don't you think about that
before you go flitting off to California?

10:51.200 --> 10:53.200
I'm sorry, Daphne.

10:53.400 --> 10:57.700
Maybe it makes me a bad person,
but I don't have it in me.

10:58.100 --> 11:00.300
It's not who I am.

11:03.000 --> 11:04.700
I'll see you.

11:20.800 --> 11:22.200
Wait, wait, wait, quiet, quiet.

11:22.400 --> 11:24.600
Don't wake your mother.
I just got her down.

11:26.300 --> 11:27.600
What are you doing here?

11:27.800 --> 11:31.300
Something terrible has happened.
Simon's left.

11:31.700 --> 11:33.500
- What do you mean, left?
- He's gone.

11:33.800 --> 11:36.300
He's left me to take care of Mum.
I don't know what I'm gonna do,

11:36.600 --> 11:39.000
but I may have to go back
to Manchester with her for a while.

11:39.300 --> 11:42.600
- No, you can't. You have a life here.
- Well, what am I supposed to do?

11:42.900 --> 11:45.200
I can't have her stay at Dr. Crane's.
There's no room.

11:45.400 --> 11:47.000
Well, you can both live here.

11:47.300 --> 11:50.200
Oh, Niles, you know she'll never
go for that arrangement.

11:51.500 --> 11:53.100
Mm...

11:53.400 --> 11:57.700
A bit late at night for a single lady
to be in a man's home, isn't it?

11:58.100 --> 12:00.300
I'm here because Simon's left.

12:00.600 --> 12:03.300
Off to California,
to do God knows what.

12:04.500 --> 12:05.900
Oh.

12:06.100 --> 12:08.700
Well, that's courageous.

12:09.000 --> 12:12.300
Good to see him
finally taking charge of his life.

12:12.600 --> 12:13.600
He's not taking charge.

12:13.800 --> 12:15.800
He left because he doesn't
wanna take care of you.

12:16.100 --> 12:21.100
That is not so. Simon is a special boy.
He wasn't meant to be kept at home.

12:21.500 --> 12:24.300
He has dreams.
You wouldn't understand that.

12:24.500 --> 12:26.100
Now, you listen to me, Mum.

12:26.300 --> 12:29.200
In case you haven't noticed,
I've got dreams too.

12:29.400 --> 12:32.500
I even moved halfway across the world
to make a life for myself.

12:32.900 --> 12:36.000
Do you admire that?
No, you don't even acknowledge it.

12:36.300 --> 12:40.500
Oh, and by the way, I'm no virgin.
Haven't been for years.

12:40.900 --> 12:44.300
You remember that boy with
the lazy eye you hated so much?

12:44.700 --> 12:46.100
Yeah, he was my first.

12:46.300 --> 12:48.300
Did it right in the parlour
where you take your tea.

12:48.600 --> 12:50.800
Then there was the German
who fixed Dad's car.

12:51.100 --> 12:52.700
Oh, yeah,
and that Irish chap I fancied

12:52.900 --> 12:55.800
who was twice my age
and had his own van and a band.

12:56.100 --> 12:57.800
Then I came to America.
Shall I go on?

12:58.100 --> 12:59.900
Well, I am a grown woman

13:00.200 --> 13:02.400
who's made her own life
and her own decisions.

13:02.600 --> 13:05.500
Now, I plan to shack up
with Niles here,

13:05.800 --> 13:09.300
and damned if we aren't gonna do it
every night of the week.

13:13.600 --> 13:15.200
Now, that's the way
it's gonna be, Mum,

13:15.300 --> 13:18.000
and if you don't like it,
that's just tough.

13:18.300 --> 13:20.000
Is that so?

13:20.200 --> 13:23.200
Well, if that's how you repay me
for all my sacrifice...

13:23.600 --> 13:26.100
- Oh, don't even start.
- Fine.

13:26.400 --> 13:28.900
Just for that, I'm not spending
another night under this roof.

13:29.200 --> 13:31.800
I intend to fetch my things,
find a hotel

13:32.100 --> 13:34.400
and be on the first flight
home tomorrow.

13:34.600 --> 13:36.600
Excuse me.

13:40.600 --> 13:43.100
Oh, my God, look at me.
I'm shaking.

13:43.400 --> 13:44.900
It just came gushing out.

13:45.100 --> 13:47.500
- Once I started, I couldn't stop.
- I know, it's all right.

13:47.800 --> 13:50.500
You were great. You were great.
I have never been prouder of you.

13:50.800 --> 13:52.600
I can't believe I talked
to my mother that way.

13:52.900 --> 13:58.400
You must have been pretty outraged to
have invented all those former lovers.

14:01.800 --> 14:06.100
- What? Oh, yes, right, of course.
- All those former lovers... Yeah.

14:07.500 --> 14:09.400
I'm actually surprised
she's leaving so easily.

14:09.700 --> 14:11.500
I thought she'd milk it a bit more.

14:12.000 --> 14:14.800
Just so you know,
I won't be needing a lift to the hotel.

14:15.000 --> 14:17.500
- I shall call a taxi.
- Whatever you want.

14:17.800 --> 14:20.400
You'll see.
I don't need any of you rotten ingrates.

14:20.700 --> 14:24.300
- I can take care of myself.
- Glad to hear it.

14:27.800 --> 14:29.500
Ow. Ow...

14:29.800 --> 14:30.800
What happened?
- Ow.

14:31.000 --> 14:33.500
Oh, oh, oh, are you hurt?
- Oh, of course I'm hurt.

14:33.700 --> 14:35.200
- Oh, no.
- Oh, get me ice.

14:35.400 --> 14:37.600
- All right, all right, all right. Okay.
- And whisky.

14:37.900 --> 14:39.300
Not that cheap stuff.

14:39.500 --> 14:41.700
- I don't know how I'm gonna fly now.
- Sit down.

14:42.000 --> 14:44.500
The pain is unbearable.

14:45.200 --> 14:50.200
Though I know I'm not welcome here.
Oh, I can't say I blame you.

14:50.600 --> 14:54.300
No sense burdening yourself
with an old woman.

14:56.000 --> 14:58.700
Who can't take care of herself.

14:59.900 --> 15:02.800
And has nowhere else to go.

15:04.900 --> 15:07.100
Oh, don't be silly.

15:09.400 --> 15:12.200
You can stay here
as long as you like.

15:12.400 --> 15:14.900
Well, move along.
The whisky's not pouring itself.

15:22.600 --> 15:26.900
Are we fiercely patriotic? Yes.

15:27.200 --> 15:30.000
But how do we best
demonstrate that?

15:30.400 --> 15:34.400
Not by infringing on the rights

15:34.800 --> 15:37.800
and balconies of others,

15:38.100 --> 15:39.500
but as most good Americans do,

15:39.700 --> 15:46.100
in our hearts, with generous spirit
and quiet reverence.

15:46.800 --> 15:48.600
I respectfully submit

15:48.900 --> 15:52.800
that when we display the flag
as Mr. Winston has,

15:53.500 --> 15:58.200
it flies in the face of the very freedoms
for which it stands.

15:59.900 --> 16:01.500
Thank you.

16:02.100 --> 16:04.700
Cam, rebuttal?

16:06.300 --> 16:10.500
Uh, the last thing I wanted
was to create conflict.

16:10.900 --> 16:14.200
I was merely trying to boost
the morale of the community.

16:14.600 --> 16:15.900
And so you have.

16:17.900 --> 16:20.100
I move that the flag stays.

16:21.800 --> 16:23.700
All right, all right, very well, then.

16:24.000 --> 16:30.500
But perhaps we could display it
on the north side of the building

16:30.900 --> 16:33.900
for the benefit
of our Canadian neighbours.

16:34.200 --> 16:35.800
That was my first instinct,

16:36.100 --> 16:38.800
but it can't be illuminated at night
from that side.

16:39.100 --> 16:40.500
- Lighting is a must.
- Absolutely.

16:41.100 --> 16:42.300
Then it's settled.

16:42.400 --> 16:45.100
All right, just hold on a second!

16:47.500 --> 16:49.000
You people are being hoodwinked.

16:49.300 --> 16:52.000
The only reason Cam hung that flag
was to get the better of me.

16:52.200 --> 16:54.000
He knows I bought the apartment
for its view.

16:54.200 --> 16:56.800
No, you bought that apartment
because you're free.

16:58.000 --> 17:01.400
Maybe you can have a view
from your balcony in Iraq.

17:01.700 --> 17:03.600
Yes, move to Iraq.

17:03.800 --> 17:06.400
Move to Iraq. Move to Iraq.

17:06.700 --> 17:10.300
- Move to Iraq.
- Wait. Wait!

17:11.599 --> 17:14.700
I am just as much an American
as every one of you.

17:16.099 --> 17:19.300
Perhaps Cam could just tell us

17:19.700 --> 17:24.000
how long he intends
to display our beautiful flag.

17:24.200 --> 17:25.599
Hmm.

17:25.900 --> 17:27.700
How about until there's world peace?

17:28.000 --> 17:29.400
Oh, that's a good idea.

17:29.700 --> 17:33.900
Oh, come on.
There's never gonna be world peace.

17:35.500 --> 17:39.300
Maybe there would be world peace
if there were more people like Cam

17:39.700 --> 17:41.100
and fewer people like you.

17:41.300 --> 17:42.400
Oh, now, just a second...

17:42.700 --> 17:47.000
<i>O beautiful, for spacious skies</i>

17:47.400 --> 17:52.700
<i>For amber waves of grain</i>

17:53.000 --> 17:58.300
<i>For purple mountain majesties</i>

17:58.700 --> 18:03.500
<i>Above the fruited plain!</i>

18:03.900 --> 18:06.700
<i>America...</i>

18:07.000 --> 18:10.700
- All right, what do you want?
- Your parking spot.

18:11.500 --> 18:13.100
You'll make all this stop?

18:13.400 --> 18:17.100
Well, there is the matter of the flag.
I can't just take it down now.

18:17.300 --> 18:20.600
All right, suggest the roof.
I'll even spring for the flagpole.

18:21.000 --> 18:24.100
<i>From sea to shining sea</i>

18:24.400 --> 18:28.000
Everyone. Hey, everyone. Everyone.

18:29.600 --> 18:33.900
The America we love
is one of good neighbours.

18:34.300 --> 18:35.500
In order to foster that,

18:35.800 --> 18:38.700
I have decided to move my flag
to the roof.

18:40.700 --> 18:44.300
This will not only serve
to mend fences,

18:44.500 --> 18:46.300
but it will provide all of Seattle

18:46.600 --> 18:50.300
a view of our precious
Stars and Stripes.

18:52.300 --> 18:54.400
- You've done it again, Cam.
- He certainly has.

18:54.700 --> 19:01.200
And in the spirit of reciprocity,
I will provide the flagpole. Ha-ha-ha.

19:03.300 --> 19:06.400
And any necessary lighting.
Ha-ha-ha.

19:06.700 --> 19:07.900
Credit grabber.

19:08.200 --> 19:11.100
Oh, come on,
we're all in agreement here.

19:11.300 --> 19:16.600
<i>O beautiful, for spacious skies</i>

19:17.000 --> 19:18.600
Come on, everybody.

19:18.700 --> 19:22.300
<i>For amber waves of grain</i>

19:22.600 --> 19:25.600
Oh, all right, I'll see you next week.

19:29.400 --> 19:31.300
Ah. How'd things go at the doctor?

19:31.500 --> 19:34.300
Couldn't find anything wrong
with the knee. Big surprise.

19:34.600 --> 19:37.200
Then why did they give me
sedatives, smarty?

19:37.500 --> 19:39.500
Because I begged him.

19:39.800 --> 19:43.200
- Oh, fetch me my water.
- Oh, I'll get it.

19:43.600 --> 19:44.500
I know how she likes it.

19:44.700 --> 19:47.600
Oh, but I know
where the glasses are.

19:49.800 --> 19:52.700
- I am so sorry about this.
- It's all right. We'll manage.

19:52.900 --> 19:55.800
I can live with anything,
as long as I can live with you.

19:56.200 --> 19:58.300
I'm still waiting out here.

19:59.200 --> 20:00.900
It's coming. Pipe down.

20:01.100 --> 20:04.900
Why?
Am I interrupting your dirty sex?

20:07.200 --> 20:09.900
It's gonna be interesting,
the three of us living together.

20:10.100 --> 20:13.500
Daphne, this is stupid.
We should just wait till she's gone.

20:13.800 --> 20:16.600
No, I said I was moving in,
and I'm going to.

20:16.900 --> 20:19.700
It took your whole life to assert
your independence from this woman.

20:20.000 --> 20:21.700
I can't ask you to live
under the same roof.

20:21.900 --> 20:25.600
- I can't ask you to live with her either.
- Oh, well, it's just temporary.

20:26.000 --> 20:29.000
And you know what? She bothers you
a lot more than she bothers me.

20:29.200 --> 20:33.800
Don't empty the sink,
I'm soaking my smalls.

20:37.500 --> 20:39.800
Well, ahem, we waited this long.

20:40.700 --> 20:43.900
- I love you, Niles.
- Mm. I love you too.

20:44.200 --> 20:48.300
And I promise, as soon as she's
on a plane for England, I'm here.

20:50.800 --> 20:52.700
Mrs. Moon, did the doctor
mention anything

20:52.900 --> 20:54.800
about when you'd be able to fly?

20:55.100 --> 21:00.900
No, didn't say a word about flying.
That's probably a bad sign, eh?

21:01.300 --> 21:03.000
Yeah.
