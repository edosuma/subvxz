- Hi, Mom!
- Hey!

13:18.970 --> 13:20.385
- How are you?

13:20.420 --> 13:22.318
- It's been a long time
since you were in India.

13:22.353 --> 13:24.182
- Oh, and that's
the way I'd like it!

13:28.462 --> 13:30.533
- For sleeping on the plane.

13:30.568 --> 13:32.052
[laughs] Oh, I couldn't help it!

13:32.087 --> 13:32.915
Can't help it!

13:33.813 --> 13:34.434
Okay,

13:34.468 --> 13:35.159
-Hilarious

13:35.193 --> 13:36.574
after the sucker punch!

13:37.609 --> 13:38.438
- Okay.

13:39.611 --> 13:40.509
- Hysterical Love.

13:41.406 --> 13:43.305
- Alright, okay, thank you!

13:45.652 --> 13:47.619
- What are you doing
with my old shirts?

13:47.654 --> 13:48.551
- Oh!

13:48.586 --> 13:49.794
I just wanted to look the part!

13:51.071 --> 13:51.900
Namaste!

13:53.108 --> 13:53.936
- Aww.

13:54.972 --> 13:56.836
These were great times.

14:00.184 --> 14:01.771
- What, you got me
a goodbye present?

14:01.806 --> 14:03.014
I mean, I'm in and I'm out, Ma.

14:03.049 --> 14:04.671
Look at the size of my suitcase.

14:07.018 --> 14:09.710
- No, this is a present
for someone else in India.

14:11.816 --> 14:12.644
- Who?

14:14.474 --> 14:17.546
Corner of Rose Garden,
Old Chandigarh, India?

14:17.580 --> 14:19.755
How the heck am I
supposed to find this?

14:19.789 --> 14:21.999
- [Mom] I'm sure
there's an app for it.

14:22.033 --> 14:25.312
- [laughs] Mom, I'm not FedEx!

14:25.347 --> 14:27.452
- No, of course not,
you're much prettier.

14:32.664 --> 14:34.666
This is for your father.

14:36.392 --> 14:37.221
- What?

14:39.016 --> 14:41.535
We haven't spoken to
Dad since I was six.

14:41.570 --> 14:42.985
And now we're exchanging gifts?

14:43.020 --> 14:45.298
- It's the picture you
snuck out of his suitcase

14:45.332 --> 14:46.816
when he left for India.

14:46.851 --> 14:49.198
And some other pictures of
you, I want him to have them.

14:51.787 --> 14:52.926
- Mom,

14:52.961 --> 14:54.031
no, why?

14:55.204 --> 14:57.689
- Because he asked
for them many times

14:57.724 --> 15:00.278
and I was too
angry to send them.

15:00.313 --> 15:01.210
- Wait.

15:01.245 --> 15:02.936
You've been in touch with him?

15:02.971 --> 15:04.489
- Sort of.

15:04.524 --> 15:07.665
He called, I hung up, he left
messages, I deleted them.

15:08.942 --> 15:10.771
It took me a long time
to get over the fact

15:10.806 --> 15:12.946
that he left just because--
- Mama.

15:12.981 --> 15:14.361
We've been over this.

15:14.396 --> 15:16.260
- And I know that now!

15:16.294 --> 15:17.606
[Shania sighs]

15:17.640 --> 15:19.090
But, Shania, he's a good man.

15:20.540 --> 15:22.922
- A good man would not
leave his family for that.

15:23.853 --> 15:28.375
- Look, he tried to make
it right in so many ways

15:28.410 --> 15:29.480
but I didn't let him.

15:31.654 --> 15:34.071
[sighs] But his last
message was different.

15:35.037 --> 15:36.073
He sounded very sad.

15:38.385 --> 15:41.526
I've forgiven him and I think
you should try, too, as well.

15:45.945 --> 15:49.431
I didn't pack this one but I
think you should have it, too.

15:53.193 --> 15:56.679
- [sighs] Oh, yay,
happily ever after.

15:58.336 --> 15:59.959

[loud squeal]

16:51.700 --> 16:52.528
- What the heck?

16:54.289 --> 16:55.186
I knew I shouldn't have come

16:55.221 --> 16:56.670
to this stupid, stupid country!

16:59.018 --> 17:00.847
Excuse me, sir?

17:00.881 --> 17:02.159
Mister?

17:02.193 --> 17:03.367
Officer!

17:03.401 --> 17:06.059
I was attacked by those people!

17:06.094 --> 17:07.164
Unprovoked, attacked!

17:08.268 --> 17:09.304
You should find them!

You know find?

17:11.720 --> 17:12.755
Do you speak English?

17:13.687 --> 17:15.068
- Find them for what?

17:15.103 --> 17:16.621
To make your clothes
more colorful?

17:16.656 --> 17:17.484
- What?

17:20.246 --> 17:21.454
It's Holi, ma'am.

17:21.488 --> 17:22.972
Festival of Color.

17:23.007 --> 17:24.457
It happens every year.

17:24.491 --> 17:26.183
They're not going to stop
for your arrival, you know.

17:28.944 --> 17:30.601

Follow me, Madamji, come!
- Okay.

17:40.921 --> 17:41.819
- Come this side!

17:41.853 --> 17:43.441
- Oh, you gotta be kidding me!

17:45.512 --> 17:48.136
I was told you're here
to cover weddings.

17:48.170 --> 17:49.827
And maybe to reconnect
with your Indian roots?

17:49.861 --> 17:51.725
- [scoffs] Well,
you were told wrong.

17:53.727 --> 17:55.281
Wait, why are you following me?

17:56.351 --> 17:58.594
- Sad as it is for both of
us, I'm not following you,

I'm with you.

[upbeat Indian music]

18:32.456 --> 18:33.284
- No, thank you.

18:34.458 --> 18:36.253
In India, we stick
to the basics.

You know, good
old-fashioned soap.

18:42.569 --> 18:43.432

18:44.778 --> 18:46.263
How's that workin' out for ya?

18:51.199 --> 18:53.201
I'm sorry, that was really mean.

I shouldn't have said that.

18:55.203 --> 18:56.135

The airport was
actually really nice!

19:15.257 --> 19:17.156
that's what you think
India's all about!

19:17.190 --> 19:18.502
Right?

19:18.536 --> 19:19.365
- No.

19:19.399 --> 19:20.366
No one ever said that.

19:22.091 --> 19:25.819
Actually, India's changed a
lot since I've been here last.

19:25.854 --> 19:27.511
- India is not a
village anymore.

19:28.097 --> 19:30.859
- Yeah, I've noticed!
- In case you were wondering.

19:30.893 --> 19:31.722

Look there, that's like
a family of five there!

Where?

19:39.971 --> 19:41.180
I don't see five.

doing on a scooter?

19:50.430 --> 19:53.468
Oh, my God!

19:53.502 --> 19:55.642
- [Shania] So, Donald, is it?

19:55.677 --> 19:57.230
Sounds almost American.

19:57.265 --> 19:59.370

19:59.405 --> 20:00.923
I like America!

be American someday!

One day, I will be in New
York, the Giant Apple!

20:26.949 --> 20:29.642
- The size does not
matter, Madamji!

But first, I must meet
American woman of my dreams!

24:07.411 --> 24:09.171
thinking he was a Muslim!

24:09.206 --> 24:11.519
No concept of other
culture, these Americans!

24:12.692 --> 24:15.626
- I'm sure not all of
them are like that, hmm?

24:15.661 --> 24:17.732
- Americans see a
turban and they think

24:17.766 --> 24:19.250
there is a bomb in it!

24:19.285 --> 24:21.529
- And how do you know
so much about Americans?

24:21.563 --> 24:22.599
You've never even
been to America.

24:22.633 --> 24:24.739
- I have seen Hollywood movies.

24:24.773 --> 24:27.396
- You and your
Hollywood and Bollywood.

24:27.431 --> 24:28.501
Why do you watch such drivel?

24:28.536 --> 24:30.261
- It makes me feel!
- Nauseous.

24:31.435 --> 24:34.024
- [sighs] Anything fun
makes you nauseous.

24:34.058 --> 24:36.854
No girlfriend, no wife, no love.

24:36.889 --> 24:39.547
[speaks in foreign language]

24:39.581 --> 24:40.996

[mobile phone rings]

24:48.314 --> 24:49.971

24:50.005 --> 24:52.180
- My God, I'm so
glad you called!

24:52.214 --> 24:53.561

24:53.595 --> 24:54.769
Hey, how was the flight?

24:54.803 --> 24:55.666
- Flight was good.

24:55.701 --> 24:57.357
The ride to the hotel?

24:57.392 --> 24:58.497
Not so good.

24:58.531 --> 25:00.015
How's work?

25:00.050 --> 25:01.845
- Well, talk about not so
good entertaining clients.

25:01.879 --> 25:03.329
You know how much I hate that!

25:03.363 --> 25:05.469
- Oh, yeah, I know.

25:05.504 --> 25:06.815
- Okay, okay, so wait a second.

25:06.850 --> 25:08.334
What's happening with your dad?

25:08.368 --> 25:10.819
- [Shania] [sighs]
I don't know, Whit.

25:10.854 --> 25:12.925
Honestly, I should
just mail it to him.

25:14.098 --> 25:17.377
A part of me, I really
wanna see him again.

26:01.767 --> 26:03.182

You look so lovely this morning!

26:04.701 --> 26:06.288
- Aww, you're so sweet!

26:09.188 --> 26:10.465
Good morning!

26:12.053 --> 26:12.881
- Good morning.

26:18.577 --> 26:20.337
- So you like the decorations?

26:20.371 --> 26:23.547
I did the flags to
make you feel at home!

26:24.444 --> 26:26.446
It's very American, no?

26:26.481 --> 26:29.795
I try to find American
flags made in America

26:30.968 --> 26:34.247
but the closest I
could get was China.

26:34.282 --> 26:35.628
- I like it, Donald.

26:35.663 --> 26:37.561
I give you an A for effort.

26:37.596 --> 26:39.598
- I don't mean to correct you.

26:39.632 --> 26:41.461
But A is for alpha.

26:41.496 --> 26:46.121
You see, effort start with E!

26:46.156 --> 26:48.399
- Hey, Mark!
- Hehehey, beautiful!

26:49.366 --> 26:51.161
I sure miss that face.

26:51.195 --> 26:52.334
- What's up?

26:52.369 --> 26:53.266
- You're never
gonna believe this.

26:53.301 --> 26:54.336
Your photographer is sick.

26:54.371 --> 26:56.649
He's stuck in Delhi and
can't get on his flight.

26:56.684 --> 26:57.616
- This can't be happening!

26:57.650 --> 26:59.031
I need another photographer!

26:59.065 --> 27:00.411
- Well, I can look
in the database.

27:00.446 --> 27:01.585
- Madamji!

27:01.620 --> 27:03.622
Madamji, Madamji!
- Would they be under F

27:03.656 --> 27:05.451
for photographer?
- Madamji, Madamji!

27:05.485 --> 27:07.246
- Hold on, Donald,
what is it, what?

27:07.280 --> 27:10.421
- I know a tiptop photographer
who lives in Chandigarh!

27:10.456 --> 27:11.837
- Oh, my gosh,
you know somebody?

27:11.871 --> 27:12.907
- Yes, Madamji!

27:12.941 --> 27:14.391
First class photographer!

27:14.425 --> 27:15.668
- Okay, Mark.

27:15.703 --> 27:17.359
The driver could give me
a photographer for today

27:17.394 --> 27:19.707
but you have to get me another
one for the next wedding.

27:21.260 --> 27:22.571
[Mark mumbles]

27:22.606 --> 27:23.780
Gotta go, bye.

27:23.814 --> 27:24.919

27:34.860 --> 27:37.690

reception was working.

27:37.725 --> 27:38.587
- Oh, yeah.

27:40.279 --> 27:42.005
We all share one
broken down satellite

27:42.039 --> 27:44.939
to serve the 1.3 billion
people of the entire country.

27:48.218 --> 27:49.806
- Oh, my God.

27:49.840 --> 27:51.428
All of you share one satellite?

27:54.362 --> 27:55.674
- Can I tell you one secret?

27:57.537 --> 28:00.506
Actually they are just
pretending to talk on the phone.

28:00.540 --> 28:02.611
Nobody's talking to anyone.

28:02.646 --> 28:03.474
- What?

28:06.512 --> 28:08.479

- [Shania] [squeals
softly] What are you doing?

28:43.722 --> 28:45.171
- [Harbhajan] [groans] You
were going to have a problem

28:45.206 --> 28:46.483
with the puddle,

28:46.517 --> 28:48.381
I was going to have a problem
with you having a problem,

28:48.416 --> 28:50.487
so now I'm avoiding
myriad of problems.

28:50.521 --> 28:51.764
You have a problem with that?

28:51.799 --> 28:53.939

in America, my portfolio!

29:16.133 --> 29:17.445
My portfolio!

29:17.479 --> 29:18.964

29:18.998 --> 29:21.311
Best photographer in
all of Chandigarh!

29:21.345 --> 29:24.141
Not Chandigarh, all
of India! [chuckles]

I think I'm onto something.

33:11.575 --> 33:13.750
I'm sure they don't want me
to know about this story.

like an Editor-In-Chief!

35:08.416 --> 35:12.489
Traditional music can get
so boring, so we re-mix it!

two and ruined one.

was not because of me!

I just asked a
couple of questions!

44:38.123 --> 44:39.607
- Yeah.

44:39.642 --> 44:40.988
And the questions were enough
to destroy an entire family,

44:41.023 --> 44:42.058
you know that?

44:42.093 --> 44:43.163
What happened was
because of the words

everyone was hoping for, right?

up and save the day!

that's a bad thing!

as a bad thing is,

you know so little about!

places a higher premium

on what other people think
versus what the heart feels?

is that? [sighs]

And when your dad and I
first met and fell in love,

it was magical and then
we just grew apart.

America wasn't for him.

her some of the Indian culture?

where she's from!

have Indian culture here.

46:06.177 --> 46:08.489
Apparently Indian
weddings are beholden

46:08.524 --> 46:11.044
to these astrologers
who tell them

46:11.078 --> 46:13.563
when they can and can't
schedule weddings.

46:13.598 --> 46:15.082
- So you're telling
me they can't schedule

46:15.117 --> 46:16.256
a wedding while I'm in town.

46:16.290 --> 46:17.671
- There's an eclipse
in five days.

46:17.705 --> 46:19.052
Apparently, that's a can't.

46:19.086 --> 46:21.399
It's not auspicious.

Just checking in to
see how you're doing.

46:38.692 --> 46:40.418
Did you reach out
to your dad yet?

46:41.868 --> 46:43.731
I really hope you can see
him while you're there.

46:45.078 --> 46:46.527
Okay, I'll call you later.

46:56.883 --> 46:58.643
- [Mom] What are you doin'?

46:58.677 --> 47:01.508
- I'm praying so
Daddy comes back.

47:02.647 --> 47:04.200
- [Mom] Where did you get that?

47:04.235 --> 47:05.719
- From the box in the garage.

47:06.547 --> 47:09.067
- I thought Daddy
took that with him.

47:09.102 --> 47:10.413
- Why did he leave, Mommy?

47:11.656 --> 47:14.521
[melancholy music]

47:15.902 --> 47:17.455
- [Mom] It took me a
long time to get over

47:17.489 --> 47:18.421
the fact that he left.

47:19.526 --> 47:21.252
- [Shania] Mom,
we've been over this.

47:21.286 --> 47:23.426
Your breasts, your ovaries...
- Yeah, yeah, I know, I know!

47:23.461 --> 47:24.634
I know!

47:24.669 --> 47:29.294
None of that defines
your womanhood.

47:30.364 --> 47:31.883
I love the Indian culture.

47:31.918 --> 47:33.160
That's why I traveled there,

47:33.195 --> 47:35.024
that's why I fell
in love with you!

47:36.129 --> 47:38.062
But everything's changed!

47:38.096 --> 47:40.927
You can't bear to look
at me, at my scars.

- [Shania] Oh, yeah?

1:01:35.450 --> 1:01:37.245
And what if they reject it?

1:01:37.279 --> 1:01:39.005
- Listen, Shania--
- Oh, my God,

1:01:39.040 --> 1:01:42.250
there is no article on hijras!

1:01:42.284 --> 1:01:43.458
So I'm kind of lost!

1:01:45.184 --> 1:01:46.841
- You seem to lose
your way a lot.

1:01:46.875 --> 1:01:47.738
- Do I really?

1:01:47.773 --> 1:01:48.635
- Oh, yes!

1:01:50.051 --> 1:01:51.397
And you're quite a handful.

1:01:52.294 --> 1:01:53.571
- So why'd you come back?

1:01:56.540 --> 1:01:58.128
- Sometimes I like
my hands full!

1:01:59.957 --> 1:02:04.928
[chuckles]
[upbeat Indian music]

1:02:18.182 --> 1:02:20.495
- Hello, Ms.
Dhaliwal, I presume?

1:02:20.529 --> 1:02:22.152
- Hello!
- Hi, I'm Harleen,

1:02:22.186 --> 1:02:24.464
the bride of the wedding
and this is Mr. [mumbles],

1:02:24.499 --> 1:02:25.603
my husband.
- Nice to meet you.

1:02:25.638 --> 1:02:26.777
Thank you so much

1:02:26.812 --> 1:02:28.020
for having us!
- Thank you so much!

1:02:28.054 --> 1:02:29.780
I suppose you're here
to cover the wedding?

1:02:29.815 --> 1:02:30.781
- Yes, yes.
- That's great!

1:02:30.816 --> 1:02:32.162
- May I ask you some questions?

1:02:32.196 --> 1:02:33.991
- Yeah, why not, go ahead.

1:02:34.026 --> 1:02:36.960
- Okay, so can you tell
me about this ceremony?

1:02:36.994 --> 1:02:39.134
- Yes, well, this
is the reception.

1:02:40.860 --> 1:02:42.966
- Is there another
word in Punjabi?

1:02:43.000 --> 1:02:46.279
- [chuckles] Reception is the
Punjabi word for reception.

1:02:46.314 --> 1:02:47.936
- Well, your English
is really great.

1:02:47.971 --> 1:02:49.317
- [Bhavna] Hi, Shaniaji!

1:02:49.351 --> 1:02:51.215
- Oh, Bhavna, what
are you doing here?

1:02:51.250 --> 1:02:53.770
- Shaniaji, Harleen and
me are very good friends.

1:02:53.804 --> 1:02:56.496
- And you know what, she
is getting married soon!

1:02:56.531 --> 1:02:58.084
- You're getting
married to the American!

1:02:58.119 --> 1:02:59.327
- No!

1:02:59.361 --> 1:03:00.811
No, I'm not going to
Alabama, my Shania ji.

1:03:01.950 --> 1:03:04.677
Actually, my Papaji
made the choice for me.

1:03:04.711 --> 1:03:07.956
And he chose my
happiness over history.

1:03:07.991 --> 1:03:09.544
So surprise for you!

1:03:09.578 --> 1:03:11.097
Salman!

1:03:11.132 --> 1:03:14.549
- Oh, wow, Cookies and Cream!
- [giggles] Yes!

1:03:14.583 --> 1:03:16.516
- That's wonderful!
- This all happened

1:03:16.551 --> 1:03:17.966
only because of you, Shaniaji.

1:03:18.001 --> 1:03:20.072
- Cookies and Cream
is back, baby!

1:03:20.106 --> 1:03:21.590
- Yeah! [laughs]

1:03:21.625 --> 1:03:24.317
Shaniaji, you know what,
when we both get married,

1:03:24.352 --> 1:03:26.837
you have to be the
bride's friend, hmm?

1:03:26.872 --> 1:03:27.942
- Bride's friend.

1:03:27.976 --> 1:03:29.806
The bridesmaid, yes.
- See you!

1:03:29.840 --> 1:03:30.807
- She's funny, come!

1:03:30.841 --> 1:03:32.291
- Very funny.
- Let's enjoy.

1:03:32.325 --> 1:03:33.188
- Testing, testing.

1:03:33.223 --> 1:03:34.155
Hanji, hanji!

1:03:34.189 --> 1:03:37.089
[loud thuds]
Hello, hello.

1:03:37.123 --> 1:03:40.299
[upbeat Indian music]

1:05:31.928 --> 1:05:33.343
- [Harbhajan] Cookies and
Cream getting married.

1:05:33.377 --> 1:05:35.448
[chuckles] Amazing.

1:05:35.483 --> 1:05:37.347
Well, there's your fifth
wedding.

1:05:37.381 --> 1:05:38.935
- [Shania] Yeah.

1:05:38.969 --> 1:05:40.798
- Come on, you should
be over the moon now.

1:05:50.325 --> 1:05:53.570
- I have to get this
package to my dad

1:05:53.604 --> 1:05:56.090
but I have no idea how to
find this crazy address.

1:06:02.613 --> 1:06:04.512
- Your dad's in Chandigarh?

1:06:04.546 --> 1:06:05.720
- Yeah.

1:06:05.754 --> 1:06:06.652
It's a long story.

1:06:07.964 --> 1:06:09.758
It's time to write
the next chapter.

1:06:10.794 --> 1:06:12.485
Will you help me?

1:06:12.520 --> 1:06:14.384
[car horn beeps]

1:06:14.418 --> 1:06:17.145
- [chuckles] We're
not even dating

1:06:17.180 --> 1:06:18.698
and I get to meet your father.

1:06:20.183 --> 1:06:22.461
[chuckles]

1:06:23.289 --> 1:06:24.808
Are we ready for that?

1:06:26.741 --> 1:06:30.055
[relaxing Indian music]

1:07:10.992 --> 1:07:12.200
- [Shania] Oh, my God.

1:07:12.235 --> 1:07:13.822
I wonder if he'll
even recognize me.

1:07:15.100 --> 1:07:17.309
Harb, I can't do this!

1:07:17.343 --> 1:07:19.863
- Oh, come on.
- Oh, my gosh!

1:07:19.897 --> 1:07:23.211

1:08:14.055 --> 1:08:17.196
[melancholy music]

1:08:17.231 --> 1:08:18.301
- Hey, I'm...

1:08:19.647 --> 1:08:20.475
I'm sorry.

1:08:22.960 --> 1:08:24.617
I know how it feels.

1:08:26.999 --> 1:08:28.725
I've been there.

1:08:28.759 --> 1:08:30.761
[sighs]

1:08:40.530 --> 1:08:43.774
[wistful Indian music]

1:09:17.946 --> 1:09:20.017
- [Little Shania] Daddy,
what happens when you die?

1:09:20.052 --> 1:09:20.880
- Mm!

1:09:21.743 --> 1:09:23.469
Well, we reincarnate!

1:09:25.057 --> 1:09:29.165
The soul comes back
as something different

1:09:29.199 --> 1:09:30.959
to be with who we love.

1:09:30.994 --> 1:09:33.341
- How do you know
the soul's back?

1:09:33.376 --> 1:09:35.861
- If you look really
hard, you'll see it.

1:09:35.895 --> 1:09:38.243
- When you die will
your soul come back?

1:09:38.277 --> 1:09:41.315
- [laughs] Only for you!

1:09:41.349 --> 1:09:43.179
- What if I don't
look hard enough,

1:09:43.213 --> 1:09:45.146
then I won't know it's you.

1:09:45.181 --> 1:09:46.285
- Hmm.

1:09:46.320 --> 1:09:47.735
Tell you what.

1:09:47.769 --> 1:09:50.255
I'll come back as

1:09:50.289 --> 1:09:51.808
a pigeon!

1:09:51.842 --> 1:09:53.361
- [Little Shania] A pigeon?

1:09:53.396 --> 1:09:58.401
- [Rajinder] Mm-hm.

1:10:13.036 --> 1:10:14.762
- Here?

1:10:14.796 --> 1:10:17.351
Better?
- Mm-hm.

1:10:17.385 --> 1:10:20.630
[wistful Indian music]

1:10:25.704 --> 1:10:26.912
Wow.

1:10:26.946 --> 1:10:28.672
Can't believe I'll
never see him again.

1:10:33.781 --> 1:10:36.922
Anyway, thank you
for bringing me.

1:10:38.993 --> 1:10:41.202
The priest said he
was cremated here.

1:10:41.237 --> 1:10:45.448
[birds squawking]
[Shania sighs]

1:10:45.482 --> 1:10:47.726
So this is where
it happens, huh?

1:10:48.658 --> 1:10:49.900
- Yes.

1:10:49.935 --> 1:10:52.006
This is where the town
brings their dead.

1:10:53.179 --> 1:10:53.939
Last rites.

1:10:57.943 --> 1:10:58.840
They bring the dead bodies here

1:10:58.875 --> 1:11:00.048
and then just

1:11:01.671 --> 1:11:02.741
turn them into flames.

1:11:03.776 --> 1:11:06.641
[melancholy music]

1:11:08.194 --> 1:11:10.127
- You know, I always wonder

1:11:12.613 --> 1:11:15.063
how people lose their
identities once they're dead.

1:11:16.375 --> 1:11:18.929
For everyone, you're,
you're just a body.

1:11:24.349 --> 1:11:25.211
You know, I,

1:11:27.490 --> 1:11:28.801
I was sitting right there,
throughout.

1:11:32.046 --> 1:11:33.427
I didn't leave my dad alone.

1:11:37.154 --> 1:11:38.155
Everybody else left.

1:11:40.296 --> 1:11:41.193
I was right there.

1:11:45.266 --> 1:11:47.026
I'm sure he's always with me.

1:11:49.166 --> 1:11:52.308
- Dad said we'd come back
as an animal or as a human

1:11:52.342 --> 1:11:55.345
to catch up with who we love.

1:11:55.380 --> 1:11:59.660
[chuckles] He said he'd return
as a pigeon just to see me.

1:12:04.941 --> 1:12:06.114
Look at all those birds.

1:12:07.944 --> 1:12:09.842
I wonder if one of
them is a pigeon.

1:12:13.018 --> 1:12:14.157
- It's not yours to find.

1:12:15.296 --> 1:12:16.159
It'll will find you.

1:12:21.682 --> 1:12:23.166
[sighs] Come on now.

1:12:23.200 --> 1:12:25.306
I'm sure your dad wouldn't
wanna see you like this.

1:12:26.169 --> 1:12:29.931
- Yeah, you're right.

1:12:29.966 --> 1:12:30.760
- Come.

[car horn beeps loudly]

1:12:51.367 --> 1:12:55.854
[chuckles] You want
me to carry you again?

1:12:55.888 --> 1:13:00.272
- I think I got this. [laughs]

1:13:16.426 --> 1:13:17.220
So pretty.

1:13:18.221 --> 1:13:19.049
- It's Indian.

1:13:23.191 --> 1:13:24.020
- Wow.

1:13:25.539 --> 1:13:26.402
- Indian.

1:13:31.890 --> 1:13:32.718
Indian.

1:13:33.788 --> 1:13:34.617
Very much Indian.

1:13:39.518 --> 1:13:42.452
[speaks in foreign language]

1:13:42.487 --> 1:13:45.490
- I can't believe
how much it hurts.

1:13:47.492 --> 1:13:52.497
- Yeah, I know.

1:13:57.467 --> 1:13:58.744
- Does it ever get better?

1:14:02.714 --> 1:14:04.957
- I still see his face
sometimes.

1:14:04.992 --> 1:14:06.890
I'm not sure if it
ever gets better.

1:14:08.720 --> 1:14:10.031
But I guess you accept it.

1:14:12.448 --> 1:14:13.621
Learn to live with the pain.

1:14:21.284 --> 1:14:23.182
You know anything about physics?

1:14:23.217 --> 1:14:24.218
- [Shania] Yeah, why?

1:14:25.978 --> 1:14:26.979
- Energy never dies.

1:14:28.153 --> 1:14:29.223
Merely changes forms.

1:14:30.811 --> 1:14:31.915
And soul is an energy,

1:14:33.296 --> 1:14:35.091
hence, it never dies.

health rating, a D minus?

Sorry, I have to take this.

You insisted on
taking care of this.

Is the mission complete?

the problem

1:15:39.189 --> 1:15:40.018
you think with she is

- [Avtar On Phone] Don't argue.

1:15:41.295 --> 1:15:43.953
You're there to get
her laptop, that's it!

1:15:43.987 --> 1:15:44.816
- Okay.

1:15:46.611 --> 1:15:48.129
You'll have to
promise me one thing.

1:15:48.164 --> 1:15:49.268
- [Avtar On Phone] Yeah.

1:15:49.303 --> 1:15:51.408
- If I get you all the stuff,

1:15:51.443 --> 1:15:53.479
she'll be able to go back home.

1:15:53.514 --> 1:15:55.792

1:16:41.320 --> 1:16:43.495
- I felt his spirit
at the gurdwara.

1:16:43.529 --> 1:16:44.841
They said he came everyday.

1:16:46.256 --> 1:16:49.432
I just wish he could have
seen me all grown up.

1:16:49.466 --> 1:16:51.641
- Oh, honey, I'm so sorry.

1:16:51.676 --> 1:16:52.849
- It's okay.

1:16:52.884 --> 1:16:55.300
Anyway, how's your
manhunt goin'?

1:16:55.334 --> 1:16:58.406
- [chuckles] My manhunt's
fine, how's your man hunk?

1:16:58.441 --> 1:17:00.926
- [chuckles] He's
not a man hunk!

- He is in picture 63!

1:17:02.687 --> 1:17:03.342
- What?

1:17:03.377 --> 1:17:04.481
What are you talking about?

1:17:04.516 --> 1:17:06.242
- Well, I think you guys
do make the cutest couple.

1:17:06.276 --> 1:17:07.208
- Oh, my goodness.

1:17:07.243 --> 1:17:08.693
Let me see.

It's that one where you've got

1:17:36.755 --> 1:17:38.757
