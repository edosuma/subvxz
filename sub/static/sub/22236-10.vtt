PHOEBE: This is my sister, Alice.

00:02.009 --> 00:05.045
I need you to find the spell
that Alice cast and reverse it.

00:05.046 --> 00:09.339
It's an excursion to the Bremin Ranges.
Maybe we can find our own way home.

00:09.346 --> 00:11.906
Maybe it has something to do
with Phoebe's sister.

00:12.129 --> 00:14.918
- Hey, guys?
- You boys have a demon after you.

00:14.919 --> 00:18.604
Created to restore the natural order
after a magical disturbance.

00:19.814 --> 00:22.865
You do that again, and I'll bounce
that thing off your head.

00:22.866 --> 00:25.192
Police, open up!
Boys!

(Scream on TV)

01:21.014 --> 01:24.614
So unrealistic. There's no way
you'd ever go into that room.

01:29.210 --> 01:31.210
You leave and I'll <i>kill</i> you.

01:31.377 --> 01:33.857
I'm just gonna go grab <i>a drink</i>.

01:59.458 --> 02:01.948
Agh, Mia!

02:04.583 --> 02:06.063
Mia...?

02:07.243 --> 02:08.640
Mia!?

02:12.458 --> 02:15.607
(Laughs)

02:16.329 --> 02:19.349
- You should have seen your face.
- I knew it all along, OK?

02:19.350 --> 02:21.310
- I just tripped.
- You were freaking out.

02:21.354 --> 02:25.158
- No. I'm not afraid of anything.
- Oh, come on, Sam.

02:25.159 --> 02:27.981
What are you afraid of?
Tell me...

02:30.718 --> 02:32.396
(Felix bangs on door)

02:32.397 --> 02:33.682
Phoebe!

02:34.742 --> 02:36.036
Phoebe!

02:40.135 --> 02:42.441
- Do you know what time it is?
- We need your help.

02:42.442 --> 02:45.807
You were supposed to be here before
school, remember? We had a deal.

02:45.808 --> 02:48.065
- We went on an excursion.
- And we got lost again.

02:48.066 --> 02:50.078
And the demon possessed Roland
and tried to kill us.

02:50.079 --> 02:53.265
- I saw magic actually happen.
- OK, slow it down.

02:53.547 --> 02:55.262
Explain yourselves.

03:01.535 --> 03:03.015
You coming?

03:04.647 --> 03:07.330
He was strong enough to lift me
off my feet, and then throw me...

03:07.331 --> 03:09.989
- I defeated the demon.
- With the magic charm.

03:09.990 --> 03:11.350
And courage.

03:11.636 --> 03:15.302
So instead of sticking to our deal,
you went looking for your own way home.

03:15.303 --> 03:17.403
- Thanks.
- We had to take the chance.

03:17.404 --> 03:19.951
It was an epic fail on all fronts.

03:20.239 --> 03:22.799
- So now you want me to help you.
- Yes?

03:22.800 --> 03:26.486
- You boys really have a nerve.
- Told you this was pointless.

03:26.487 --> 03:29.472
You're right, I can't trust you.
Deal's off.

03:30.317 --> 03:33.164
Come on.
We're wasting our time.

03:35.010 --> 03:36.761
Do you recognise this?

03:37.744 --> 03:40.655
- They're used for the conjurations.
- Did it belong to Alice?

03:40.858 --> 03:43.344
- Where did you find that?
- The Bremin Forest.

03:43.345 --> 03:46.089
- The police looked there, and so did I.
- It's a hidden path.

03:46.090 --> 03:48.837
You had to fall off a cliff
to get there. Literally.

03:48.838 --> 03:50.812
There was another
sign of Alice as well.

03:50.813 --> 03:52.963
- What?
- An altar.

03:52.964 --> 03:55.142
It was in the same
place where we got lost.

03:55.519 --> 03:57.679
There's a connection
between you and her.

03:58.027 --> 03:59.822
Will you help us?

04:00.142 --> 04:02.368
I'll let you know
in the morning.

04:02.591 --> 04:05.589
What, you think this face needs
anything less than eight hours?

04:05.590 --> 04:07.829
Bye-bye.
Back to your shack.

04:11.099 --> 04:12.585
What now?

04:13.694 --> 04:16.329
You know when we said
we needed help?

04:18.932 --> 04:21.612
I don't do maternal
and I don't do breakfast.

04:22.091 --> 04:23.803
I think we get that.

04:27.605 --> 04:29.341
Hey, Sam...

04:30.313 --> 04:33.587
- I'm sorry we didn't get home.
- Sure you are.

04:35.188 --> 04:36.788
Wanna see something?

04:42.592 --> 04:44.627
Voodoo dolls.

04:45.349 --> 04:48.337
- Do you think they're magic?
- I don't know.

04:48.338 --> 04:51.658
FELIX: Look, put 'em away.
Don't want her to catch us snooping.

04:55.439 --> 04:59.799
Sam, if science can't get us home,
magic will.

05:00.551 --> 05:02.338
You wanna know
what I think?

05:03.612 --> 05:07.381
I think we're gonna be stuck here
for the rest of our lives.

05:25.627 --> 05:28.027
Agh, Mia!

05:29.252 --> 05:30.925
Mia!

05:38.291 --> 05:39.851
I know that thing.

05:50.619 --> 05:52.639
DEMON: <i>Bring it to me.</i>

05:55.806 --> 05:58.248
<i>I can help you.</i>

06:31.220 --> 06:34.411
- Morning.
- Were you just watching me sleep?

06:34.412 --> 06:35.690
No.

06:36.367 --> 06:38.777
We've definitely been spending
too much time together.

06:38.778 --> 06:41.793
Good, because that's when
you're strongest.

06:41.794 --> 06:43.647
The demon knows that too.

06:43.890 --> 06:47.239
Somewhere in here
is the spell my sister cast.

06:47.240 --> 06:51.607
- Find her. For all our sakes.
- How would I know which one it is?

06:52.327 --> 06:56.544
You'll feel it.
A true witch can feel magic residue.

06:57.212 --> 07:00.792
- You're a true witch?
- So she says.

07:07.759 --> 07:10.269
___

07:11.514 --> 07:12.994
See something?

07:13.467 --> 07:18.672
No. Maybe I should take this
and study it alone.

07:18.673 --> 07:22.113
- No distractions.
- The book stays with me. Always.

07:22.347 --> 07:24.027
(Knock on door)

07:24.028 --> 07:25.908
(Sighs)

07:29.916 --> 07:31.836
(Knock on door)

07:31.837 --> 07:33.197
Who is it?

07:39.827 --> 07:43.027
Sergeant Riles,
what a lovely surprise.

07:43.147 --> 07:44.547
Phoebe...

07:46.440 --> 07:48.574
Where are
"your nephews"...?

07:49.464 --> 07:52.452
Ah, I don't know.

07:52.453 --> 07:55.713
Um, they're out,
just, you know...

07:56.168 --> 08:01.068
Running and throwing stuff.
Whatever teenage boys do.

08:01.147 --> 08:03.027
They should be at school.

08:03.148 --> 08:05.525
You know that,
being such a devoted guardian.

08:05.526 --> 08:09.363
School. That's exactly where they are.
What do you want them for?

08:09.546 --> 08:10.935
Trespassing.

08:10.936 --> 08:13.400
- Let's go.
- Where?

08:13.401 --> 08:14.586
School.

08:17.907 --> 08:20.227
(School bell beeps)

08:22.815 --> 08:25.639
BATES: Oh, I despair of you,
boys, I really do.

08:26.280 --> 08:28.357
I mean,
what were you thinking?

08:30.939 --> 08:33.801
We have made every effort
to make you feel welcome.

08:33.802 --> 08:35.761
And we appreciate
your efforts, Mr Bates.

08:35.763 --> 08:37.621
But at every step of the way,

08:37.621 --> 08:40.707
your behaviour has indicated that you do
not want to be part of this community.

08:40.708 --> 08:42.988
No! Really, we do want
to be part of this world.

08:42.989 --> 08:46.014
- More than anything.
- Not all of us.

08:46.015 --> 08:47.242
Sam.

08:47.268 --> 08:49.622
Some of us are sick of playing
these whack games.

08:49.623 --> 08:51.394
Beg your pardon!

08:52.692 --> 08:54.172
Hey, Sam!

08:54.332 --> 08:57.237
- I'm sorry, he's really upset.
- He misses his girlfriend.

08:57.238 --> 08:59.616
Honestly, I know it's taken us
a while to adjust.

08:59.617 --> 09:02.177
But from now on,
we will be model students.

09:02.474 --> 09:06.263
Yes, well, one more outburst
like that

09:06.264 --> 09:09.503
and you'll be cleaning graffiti
off the desks for the next month.

09:10.113 --> 09:11.593
Or three.

09:11.940 --> 09:14.757
Hey, Sam, wait up!

09:16.041 --> 09:17.251
What was that all about?

09:17.252 --> 09:19.898
You're all so desperate
to fit in, but I'm not.

09:20.041 --> 09:23.546
- Do any of you even want to go home?
- Of course.

09:24.104 --> 09:26.340
Well, it didn't seem like it
in the forest.

09:26.341 --> 09:27.701
I do.

09:27.772 --> 09:31.022
I wanna go home and show my mum
I can be a better person.

09:31.023 --> 09:32.630
So do I.

09:35.983 --> 09:39.018
I don't believe it.
The break-up tree.

09:39.355 --> 09:41.061
She's dropping him.

09:43.078 --> 09:46.102
This is the only good thing that's
happened since we've been here.

09:46.123 --> 09:48.886
Dude, I know he's your
evil twin and all but...

09:49.207 --> 09:51.312
He looks kinda crushed.

09:51.697 --> 09:54.097
Mia deserves someone
who will treat her better.

09:54.179 --> 09:55.852
I'm gonna see if she's OK.

09:57.104 --> 09:58.949
Better person, huh?

09:59.555 --> 10:01.464
Jake, hi.

10:01.783 --> 10:05.262
I'd just like to say thank you
for sticking up for me on the bus.

10:05.263 --> 10:07.943
- Oh, that's OK.
- No, no, really. I mean...

10:07.944 --> 10:09.823
It's the first time
it's ever happened to me.

10:09.824 --> 10:12.663
Someone like you standing up
for someone like me.

10:13.265 --> 10:16.818
- I used to be just like those guys.
- This is for you.

10:17.326 --> 10:20.208
- Really?
- A token of my appreciation.

10:20.334 --> 10:21.438
Um...

10:21.464 --> 10:23.594
- I've got another one.
- Thanks.

10:23.595 --> 10:24.995
OK, bye.

10:30.904 --> 10:32.904
Hey, Mia.

10:35.547 --> 10:36.686
Hi.

10:37.050 --> 10:38.499
Hey.

10:40.058 --> 10:43.210
I... saw you and Sammy
under the tree.

10:43.400 --> 10:45.369
Yeah. We broke up.

10:46.646 --> 10:48.400
- I'm sorry.
- It's OK.

10:48.515 --> 10:50.955
It's been happening
for a while now so...

10:51.437 --> 10:53.227
If you need someone
to talk to,

10:53.228 --> 10:55.698
I've been going through some pretty
crazy stuff lately as well.

10:55.699 --> 11:00.043
Sam, you're really sweet
but I need to be alone right now.

11:01.832 --> 11:03.232
Sure.

11:06.344 --> 11:10.110
(Cawing)

11:17.461 --> 11:20.181
Science and magic are
more similar than I thought.

11:20.290 --> 11:23.319
I'm convinced there's a combination
of the two that brought us here.

11:23.320 --> 11:24.485
How?

11:24.593 --> 11:27.359
A magical act
that ripped open a portal

11:27.360 --> 11:29.798
that brought us
into this parallel universe.

11:29.932 --> 11:31.292
Maybe.

11:32.092 --> 11:34.663
There's spells
about wealth...

11:34.835 --> 11:36.542
Fertility...

11:36.543 --> 11:41.053
Love, curses, wealth...

11:41.054 --> 11:42.324
Wealth.

11:42.508 --> 11:47.063
Come on, Alice, what about how
to get rid of a demon of restoration?

11:47.252 --> 11:49.572
Aren't you supposed to be
looking for Alice's spell?

11:49.573 --> 11:52.219
Our most immediate need
is demon removal.

11:55.044 --> 11:56.924
There's something
that keeps bothering me.

11:56.925 --> 11:59.786
That's funny, I'm being bothered
by something too.

12:00.122 --> 12:03.823
Magic is governed by a strict set
of principles - cause and effect.

12:03.824 --> 12:05.704
- Kind of like science.
- Kind of.

12:05.705 --> 12:09.218
So then what's the cause?
Why us?

12:09.243 --> 12:11.183
Maybe it's just random.

12:11.434 --> 12:15.104
Hey, I thought you were gonna
proofread my new blog entry.

12:15.161 --> 12:17.552
Oh, sorry,
I got side-tracked.

12:17.624 --> 12:20.036
You are cute
when you get side-tracked.

12:21.622 --> 12:24.235
Do you remember the last time
we were in here?

12:24.236 --> 12:28.463
- It was so romantic.
- What, being attacked by wild dogs?

12:28.464 --> 12:31.410
No, before that.
When the lights flickered.

12:31.411 --> 12:33.370
Oh, yeah...

12:33.899 --> 12:36.899
- What if the power went out now?
- I hope not.

12:36.900 --> 12:39.362
This laptop has
no back-up power supply.

12:42.019 --> 12:43.499
Oh...

12:46.216 --> 12:50.410
Don't mind me. I'll just sit
over here and throw up in silence.

13:00.581 --> 13:02.581
(Breeze)

13:10.838 --> 13:12.094
Hello...?

13:21.359 --> 13:24.261
BATES: If you remember, last week
we were looking at dust mites,

13:24.451 --> 13:27.051
the choridea.

13:27.060 --> 13:29.990
So we're looking at life span
from egg,

13:29.991 --> 13:34.872
through larvae, then obviously
we have the hypopus.

13:35.660 --> 13:37.526
Thank you for joining us.

13:37.527 --> 13:39.966
And then there was,
of course, the...

13:39.967 --> 13:41.091
Hey.

14:06.660 --> 14:08.893
___

14:14.381 --> 14:16.383
What's happening
to me?

14:16.409 --> 14:18.410
It is keeping
you here.

14:18.626 --> 14:21.648
Destroy it and you will return
to where you belong.

14:21.870 --> 14:23.550
But I can't.

14:23.670 --> 14:25.687
Then you will never
go home.

14:32.750 --> 14:34.550
(School bell beeps)

14:35.765 --> 14:37.165
BATES: <i>Thank you, class.</i>

14:37.166 --> 14:41.143
<i>Right after lunch we will be meeting
at the basketball courts for sport.</i>

14:41.144 --> 14:44.504
<i>So you can change into
your sports uniforms at lunch</i>

14:45.110 --> 14:49.750
<i>and we will continue the fascinating
story of the dust mite next week.</i>

15:00.305 --> 15:04.486
Hey, Felix. Sorry about getting us
into trouble with Mr Bates.

15:04.487 --> 15:06.913
Oh, it's OK.
We covered for you.

15:07.210 --> 15:10.950
- I went kinda crazy.
- There's been a lot of that happening.

15:13.095 --> 15:15.295
So that's the magic bling, eh?

15:17.745 --> 15:19.417
Mind if I try it on?

15:19.418 --> 15:22.258
- It's probably better if I keep it...
- Come on, man.

15:22.259 --> 15:24.149
Just let me try it on.

15:24.181 --> 15:27.723
- Felix, I don't think it's random magic.
- How do you know that?

15:27.724 --> 15:31.629
According to the rules of magic,
a spell has to be cast by someone.

15:31.630 --> 15:34.709
The question is,
what spell and who cast it?

15:35.575 --> 15:36.935
What's up?

15:38.517 --> 15:40.917
Hey guys,
can we talk about this later?

15:40.918 --> 15:43.478
I have to meet Oscar
and I'm late so...

15:44.390 --> 15:45.870
Curious.

15:49.590 --> 15:52.743
- Why are you holding a unicorn?
- It's a gift.

15:57.930 --> 16:01.463
- What's that book?
- It's my Book of Shadows.

16:01.464 --> 16:04.687
- So you have your own spells?
- Kind of.

16:04.688 --> 16:06.168
Do any of them work?

16:06.670 --> 16:08.150
Hey, Oscar.

16:08.700 --> 16:12.496
Ellen's looking for you. She wants
to interview you for her new blog.

16:12.497 --> 16:15.799
- "Aliens among us".
- The truth will finally come out.

16:16.007 --> 16:18.460
Sorry, but the people
have a right to know.

16:24.854 --> 16:27.254
Felix, you know
you can trust me, right?

16:28.225 --> 16:29.430
Why?

16:29.824 --> 16:33.390
- Something weird's been happening today.
- Weirder than normal?

16:36.370 --> 16:39.002
I just want you to know
that this is the only way,

16:39.003 --> 16:41.550
and that one day,
you'll thank me.

16:44.649 --> 16:47.630
- Give it.
- Why are you being such a psycho?

16:49.040 --> 16:52.643
They have all failed.
But you can succeed.

16:53.211 --> 16:56.950
Destroy the talisman and
go back home, where you belong.

16:57.304 --> 16:59.184
Sam, don't!

17:09.837 --> 17:13.022
- Was that the talisman?
- I think so.

17:27.354 --> 17:29.421
Sam, what are you doing?

17:29.422 --> 17:31.302
This thing. It's why we're here.

17:31.303 --> 17:33.863
- Mate, what are you talking about?
- Mia told me.

17:33.864 --> 17:35.273
What's Mia got to do with it?

17:35.274 --> 17:37.234
The talisman is why
we're still here.

17:37.235 --> 17:39.755
Mia doesn't know
anything about magic.

17:40.070 --> 17:41.283
Does she?

17:41.284 --> 17:44.434
Well, if I blitz this thing,
we'll all go back to our real lives.

17:44.435 --> 17:46.473
The talisman's protecting us, Sam.

17:46.474 --> 17:50.766
No, you don't understand.
Mia's right. You'll see.

17:58.430 --> 18:00.550
(High-pitched tone)

18:08.987 --> 18:12.253
Poor Felix, all alone.

18:20.504 --> 18:21.984
We're still here.

18:22.550 --> 18:24.150
JAKE: And defenceless.

18:24.770 --> 18:26.450
What have I done?

18:27.216 --> 18:29.100
Have I just killed us?

18:29.465 --> 18:31.145
I hope not.

18:31.974 --> 18:35.007
OK, Sam, get it together.

18:35.302 --> 18:38.173
- Can this be fixed?
- Felix would know.

18:38.174 --> 18:40.504
He's in the old classroom
at the back of the school with Mia.

18:40.505 --> 18:41.613
Let's go!

18:43.780 --> 18:45.460
Order must be restored.

18:45.910 --> 18:48.487
Oh, here to help your girlfriend
finish me off?

18:48.488 --> 18:50.528
- Traitor!
- Shut up, Felix.

18:50.529 --> 18:52.649
- It was the demon.
- She's been possessed!

18:52.650 --> 18:55.810
- I think I've worked that out.
- Just let me try something.

18:56.168 --> 19:00.317
Mia. It's me, Sam.

19:00.890 --> 19:02.490
I know this isn't you.

19:02.658 --> 19:06.761
There's something else in control.
But you can beat this, Mia.

19:07.081 --> 19:08.961
Just don't be afraid.

19:11.162 --> 19:12.642
Fight it.

19:16.929 --> 19:20.188
- I guess that wasn't part of the plan.
- We've gotta find Felix.

19:23.097 --> 19:25.691
- Did he come in here?
- No, this is a detour.

19:25.692 --> 19:27.972
Time to make that thing
run from us.

19:30.945 --> 19:32.345
Perfect.

19:32.346 --> 19:34.906
No, no, no,
I'm sure it was like this.

19:37.596 --> 19:40.433
It allows for any combination.
How do we know which one works?

19:40.434 --> 19:43.537
Cool your jets.
The demon made me draw it.

19:57.828 --> 19:59.364
Felix.

19:59.951 --> 20:01.324
Felix!

20:03.968 --> 20:05.296
Didn't you hear me?

20:05.297 --> 20:08.537
Well, you're not exactly my most
trusted bestie at the moment.

20:08.538 --> 20:11.178
- Would this change your mind?
- You got it back.

20:12.493 --> 20:14.895
- Why is it sticky?
- Probably the glue...?

20:14.896 --> 20:17.256
- What...?
- There was <i>kind</i> of an incident.

20:19.297 --> 20:20.777
Perfect timing.

20:22.226 --> 20:26.802
Divinity of the Elements.
Earth, Water, Air, Fire.

20:26.803 --> 20:29.381
- I invoke Thee.
- It's not glowing!

20:30.150 --> 20:32.030
What did you guys do?

20:34.681 --> 20:36.341
Run!

20:41.875 --> 20:44.156
The auto workshop!
Come on!

20:49.304 --> 20:51.487
ELLEN: Mia! Hey, Mia!

20:53.813 --> 20:56.463
OMG. I heard about Sammy.

20:56.464 --> 20:58.723
You OK, babe?

20:58.795 --> 21:00.048
Babe.

21:01.893 --> 21:05.293
Just let me know if you feel like
talking about it!

21:05.375 --> 21:07.652
I totally understand.

21:10.006 --> 21:13.205
- Let's make a run to Phoebe's.
- We won't even make it across the road!

21:13.214 --> 21:15.627
We have to keep going.
She's gonna catch us.

21:16.271 --> 21:18.393
Not if we catch her first.

21:56.209 --> 21:57.955
What now?

21:58.228 --> 21:59.516
Wait.

22:13.060 --> 22:14.540
Come on, come on.

22:21.366 --> 22:23.166
Hurry up, hurry up,
hurry up!

22:29.335 --> 22:30.995
Get out of here, dude!

22:34.335 --> 22:38.913
She's got me. Help!
She's got my legs. Help!

22:39.124 --> 22:41.934
Lose the pants!
Get dacked or die!

23:00.914 --> 23:05.037
I don't know what's worse, being chased
by a demon or seeing you in your undies.

23:06.310 --> 23:07.881
Let's not celebrate
prematurely.

23:07.882 --> 23:09.750
- Arcane Lane?
- Mind reader.

23:10.455 --> 23:13.135
(Bangs on door)

23:13.586 --> 23:15.666
I'll catch up.
I can't leave Mia.

23:15.741 --> 23:17.540
- I'll come with you.
- Be careful.

23:17.610 --> 23:20.758
- Why... why have you got a unicorn?
- Mike gave it to me.

23:20.913 --> 23:23.308
- A guy gave you a unicorn?
- What's wrong with that?

23:23.309 --> 23:24.568
Come on!

23:37.456 --> 23:38.744
Hello...?

23:40.581 --> 23:43.354
Sam, we've gotta go.
She'll be fine.

23:46.688 --> 23:49.864
(Dog barking)

24:09.381 --> 24:10.981
I'm done.

24:11.452 --> 24:12.932
I won't be far behind.

24:17.781 --> 24:19.823
You know, it's weird.

24:20.376 --> 24:24.814
Demon Roland and Demon Mia could have
killed the rest of us multiple times, but

24:25.697 --> 24:28.591
they only seem
to be interested in you.

24:29.124 --> 24:32.795
I suppose the demon targets
the greatest magic power.

24:33.340 --> 24:36.808
- And the most interesting.
- A logical explanation.

24:37.935 --> 24:39.664
But still...

24:40.943 --> 24:42.463
See you in the morning.

24:52.390 --> 24:54.918
___

24:55.287 --> 24:58.247
___

24:58.611 --> 25:00.211
That's the connection.

25:17.461 --> 25:19.461
And this is our way home.

25:24.110 --> 25:25.590
Is today Mother's Day?

25:25.591 --> 25:26.748
Mum.

25:26.774 --> 25:29.575
Man, this really sucks.

25:29.576 --> 25:31.548
ANDY: The demon is definitely evolving.

25:31.549 --> 25:34.679
Every time we defeat it, the demon takes
a while to get its strength back.

25:34.680 --> 25:36.612
ANDY: I wonder
how it will change next.

25:37.314 --> 25:39.183
- My...
- MAN: Call an ambulance!

25:39.184 --> 25:43.142
- Now the demon's attacking our mums.
- On Mother's Day! It's pure evil!

25:43.143 --> 25:44.366
Let's hit the books.

25:44.367 --> 25:46.124
Sarah? Hello?

25:46.125 --> 25:48.691
There's nothing in here about
the demon attacking blood kin.

25:48.692 --> 25:51.947
Mum! Mum, please wake up.
