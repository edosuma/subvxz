00:06.806 --> 00:08.808
Good night.

00:09.209 --> 00:11.211
See you later.

00:13.000 --> 00:19.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:36.436 --> 00:39.239
<screams>
no! Please...

00:40.440 --> 00:42.442
we'll go up to your place
and see what we can find.

00:42.477 --> 00:43.243
Maybe have a party, huh?

00:43.643 --> 00:44.809
Please! No!

00:44.844 --> 00:46.446
Look you can make it
easy or you can make it hard.

00:46.481 --> 00:48.048
You stole my line.

00:48.448 --> 00:50.815
Ugh...!

00:50.850 --> 00:53.253
Still want to get lucky?

01:01.661 --> 01:04.029
Hey, hey. It's okay. It's okay.

01:04.063 --> 01:08.068
Well, what did
you expect? A thank you?

01:08.468 --> 01:10.069
What are you doing?

01:10.104 --> 01:11.671
I was saving someone.

01:12.072 --> 01:14.074
I thought that's
what we were about.

01:14.109 --> 01:15.275
You know exactly what i mean.

01:15.675 --> 01:17.677
You're running around
alone, showing off your powers.

01:18.078 --> 01:20.080
I feel different now. Okay?

01:20.115 --> 01:22.047
There's stuff i need to do.

01:22.082 --> 01:25.285
I need to be out in the
night. I need to hunt. Alone.

01:25.320 --> 01:27.104
Where's this going, shal?

01:27.139 --> 01:28.853
I don't know, brennan.

01:28.888 --> 01:32.892
All i know is that whatever's
happening to me isn't

01:32.927 --> 01:37.297
something that i can
just turn off or ignore.

02:14.134 --> 02:15.735
There he is.

02:15.770 --> 02:17.337
Let's get him.

02:18.538 --> 02:20.140
Come on.

02:29.349 --> 02:31.316
No... no!

02:31.351 --> 02:32.917
Please... please!

02:32.952 --> 02:35.355
Just take it
easy. You'll be okay.

02:38.158 --> 02:39.724
I am adam kane.

02:39.759 --> 02:43.162
I was a pioneer
of genetic research,

02:43.197 --> 02:46.566
manipulating dna
to save human lives.

02:46.966 --> 02:50.170
But in many their
genes unexpectedly mutated.

02:50.205 --> 02:53.373
They developed
super-human abilities.

03:21.000 --> 03:23.403
Together with four of the
most powerful i fight to protect

03:23.803 --> 03:25.805
a world that doesn't
even know we exist.

03:29.809 --> 03:32.612
We are... mutant x.

03:39.052 --> 03:41.454
His name is dominic rydell.

03:41.854 --> 03:44.257
He's a physicist working
at the extreme cutting edge of

03:44.657 --> 03:47.825
research into quantum power.

03:47.860 --> 03:51.864
Now, the rumour is that he was
on the verge of splitting the

03:51.899 --> 03:56.669
light particle, to give
us unlimited free energy.

03:57.070 --> 03:58.236
Well, that's not possible.

03:58.271 --> 03:59.872
You can't get any
smaller than a quantum.

03:59.907 --> 04:01.439
Well, he proved that you can.

04:01.474 --> 04:03.276
And the value of his
process - whew - limitless.

04:03.311 --> 04:05.078
Well, a guy with that
much cooking in his head,

04:05.478 --> 04:06.644
maybe he just snapped.

04:06.679 --> 04:08.281
You think someone was
trying to steal his process?

04:08.316 --> 04:09.447
Well, i don't know.

04:09.482 --> 04:11.084
But i do know that i want
to spend some time with him,

04:11.119 --> 04:12.650
trying to find out.

04:12.685 --> 04:13.851
And i want you to come with me,

04:13.886 --> 04:15.488
see if there's something
that you can pick up.

04:15.888 --> 04:17.454
Jesse, i want you to stay here.

04:17.490 --> 04:19.492
Try to recreate the last
hours before his disappearance.

04:19.892 --> 04:21.894
See if there's a clue in there
that'll tell us what happened.

04:21.928 --> 04:24.697
I'm on it.

04:27.500 --> 04:30.303
You know, i still
can't believe we got access
to rydell this easily.

04:30.338 --> 04:32.322
Well, i'd like to think
it was their knowledge of my

04:32.357 --> 04:34.272
specialty in dealing
with exotic medical problems.

04:34.307 --> 04:35.908
But i think it has more to
do with the fact that i funded

04:36.309 --> 04:38.711
the hospital's new
mri machine last month.

04:38.746 --> 04:39.877
Nice.

04:39.912 --> 04:42.315
And here i was worried
to ask for a raise.

04:42.350 --> 04:45.883
Mr. Kane.

04:45.918 --> 04:47.085
Polly mcwilliams.

04:47.120 --> 04:50.288
How do you do?
This emma delauro.

04:50.323 --> 04:52.525
I don't usually
like admitting failure,

04:52.560 --> 04:54.727
but, well this
one's got me stumped.

05:00.333 --> 05:02.300
The subject has
no history of mental illness.

05:02.335 --> 05:04.737
Within a few hours, he's
in a fully dissociative state.

05:04.772 --> 05:06.339
Like schizophrenia?

05:06.739 --> 05:09.942
More intense than i've seen.

05:09.977 --> 05:12.745
May we?

05:17.550 --> 05:20.353
Whatever
hallucinations he's dealing
with are all-encompassing.

05:20.388 --> 05:24.357
He's not dealing
with reality at any level.

05:24.757 --> 05:27.560
It's like he's
trapped in another world.

05:27.960 --> 05:29.527
Exactly.

05:29.562 --> 05:31.929
How is he physically?

05:31.964 --> 05:34.332
Well, actually, that's
my primary concern right now.

05:34.367 --> 05:37.570
Whatever's going on in this
world he's seeing is having a

05:37.605 --> 05:41.139
direct effect on
his real-world physiology.

05:41.174 --> 05:43.176
His blood pressure and heart
rate are going through the roof.

05:43.211 --> 05:45.143
Have you tried medication?

05:45.178 --> 05:49.147
We've sedated him
to the maximum safe levels.

05:49.182 --> 05:52.785
But, whatever has a hold of him
just blasts right through it.

05:52.820 --> 05:55.988
I don't think he'll last
more than twenty-four hours.

05:56.023 --> 05:57.955
All right. I
might be able to help.

05:57.990 --> 06:00.393
But i'll need him transferred
to my own facility,

06:00.793 --> 06:02.595
and i'll need
you to arrange that.

06:02.630 --> 06:04.397
I'll arrange the
transfer right away.

06:04.797 --> 06:06.399
Thank you.

06:08.801 --> 06:11.569
So, no trace
of psychoactive drugs.

06:11.604 --> 06:16.208
And they think that the damage
done to his psyche was way

06:16.243 --> 06:20.778
too fast
for hypnosis or classical
brainwashing techniques.

06:20.813 --> 06:24.817
So maybe what
we're dealing with is some
sort of psychic mind attack.

06:24.852 --> 06:28.020
Do you think you'll be able
to calm him telempathically?

06:28.055 --> 06:30.022
No!

06:31.624 --> 06:33.626
Please... please...

06:33.661 --> 06:35.593
please... let me go?

06:35.628 --> 06:40.433
Dominic, my name is
adam kane. Can you hear me?

06:40.833 --> 06:43.201
Leave me alone...

06:43.236 --> 06:49.242
dominic. I'm real.
I'm here to help you.

06:49.277 --> 06:52.445
Liar!

06:56.048 --> 06:58.816
No. No more.

06:58.851 --> 07:02.054
You just let me go.

07:05.258 --> 07:10.027
Are you all right? What is it?

07:10.062 --> 07:13.866
Whatever's got
ahold of him is strong.

07:13.901 --> 07:17.670
And that scares
the hell out of me.

07:23.276 --> 07:25.678
It turns out our man, rydell,
had just finished giving a

07:26.078 --> 07:28.080
lecture
to a scientific conference
at bower university three

07:28.115 --> 07:30.448
hours before he disappeared.

07:30.483 --> 07:32.850
You're telling us he
was abducted by scientists?

07:32.885 --> 07:35.288
Well, unfortunately, scientists
weren't the only ones there.

07:35.688 --> 07:38.891
I managed to id almost everybody
in the audience from the

07:38.926 --> 07:40.893
university database
and the scientific journals

07:40.928 --> 07:43.261
- everybody except for this guy.

07:43.296 --> 07:46.499
Now, when i put his
photo through our database

07:46.534 --> 07:48.866
it id'd him as jerzy novotny.

07:48.901 --> 07:52.104
Now, jerzy is currently working
as the trade commissioner at

07:52.139 --> 07:53.671
the balkistan mission.

07:53.706 --> 07:56.909
His last gig was as
a top level kgb agent before

07:56.944 --> 07:59.312
the fall of the soviet union.

07:59.712 --> 08:02.515
Yeah, but it still
doesn't explain what he
was doing at the conference.

08:02.550 --> 08:04.917
Well that's what you and
shalimar are going to find out.

08:04.952 --> 08:06.484
What's the setup?

08:06.519 --> 08:08.886
There's a party tonight
at the balkistan embassy.

08:08.921 --> 08:11.324
Trade commissioner novotny
has invited certain members of

08:11.359 --> 08:13.291
the bower university conference,

08:13.326 --> 08:15.693
and you and shalimar
are going to be guests.

08:15.728 --> 08:18.496
Nice. Always wanted to
go to a party at the embassy.

08:18.531 --> 08:22.134
Well, let's
hope they remember to count
the silverware afterwards.

08:22.169 --> 08:23.301
Easy.

08:23.336 --> 08:24.902
Well, let's go.

08:24.937 --> 08:26.939
We got a lot of
work to do to get ready.

08:30.543 --> 08:35.712
Let me out. Let me out.

08:35.748 --> 08:44.557
It's okay. You're
not inside anything.

08:44.957 --> 08:46.924
Look around you.

08:46.959 --> 08:48.526
I've got eyes, dammit.

08:48.561 --> 08:49.762
Why are you doing this to me?

08:50.162 --> 08:51.329
Huh?

08:51.364 --> 08:55.368
Leave me alone.
Just leave me alone!

09:03.376 --> 09:04.577
Are you trying
to connect with him...?

09:04.977 --> 09:07.345
No.

09:07.380 --> 09:09.782
Look, i can't stand to see
him in this kind of pain, adam.

09:09.817 --> 09:14.151
I'm afraid that if...

09:14.186 --> 09:17.790
if i open myself up i won't
be able to protect myself from

09:17.825 --> 09:21.359
whatever's attacking his mind.

09:21.394 --> 09:23.396
But we both know that your
powers have grown stronger over

09:23.431 --> 09:24.997
the last couple of weeks.

09:25.398 --> 09:26.999
Yeah but we don't know
what's going on inside there.

09:27.400 --> 09:31.404
If i... if i connect with
him it might even accelerate

09:31.439 --> 09:33.005
whatever's killing him.

09:33.406 --> 09:35.808
What happens if we don't
try to connect with him?

09:35.843 --> 09:37.775
Huh?

09:37.810 --> 09:40.212
I mean, his vital signs
keep spinning out of control

09:40.247 --> 09:43.416
'til he has a heart
attack or a stroke?

09:43.816 --> 09:51.789
Emma. I know you're afraid.

09:51.824 --> 09:58.631
But you might be surprised
at what you can do.

09:58.666 --> 10:02.252
Look at me.

10:02.287 --> 10:05.838
Think about it.

10:33.065 --> 10:34.667
All right, keep your eye
out for the trade commissioner.

10:35.067 --> 10:37.669
According to adam, he's got
a serious eye for the ladies.

10:37.704 --> 10:40.272
Well, i assumed that's why i
was the one wearing this dress.

10:40.673 --> 10:44.677
Trust me, you in that
dress is always a good idea.

10:53.085 --> 10:55.453
Hey, bren.

10:55.488 --> 10:58.891
Novotny. Two o'clock.

10:58.926 --> 11:02.294
Ready for action?

11:02.695 --> 11:04.697
Just remember,
if you do get him alone,

11:05.097 --> 11:08.300
don't get too
far out of my sight.

11:08.701 --> 11:10.903
You had to say that, didn't you?

11:10.938 --> 11:12.822
And we were doing so well here.

11:12.857 --> 11:14.707
What's that supposed to mean?

11:15.107 --> 11:16.709
I could take out the security
of this entire embassy.

11:16.744 --> 11:19.076
I don't need you to play daddy.

11:19.111 --> 11:22.314
<laughs> shalimar,
this is not a one-woman show.

11:22.349 --> 11:24.717
There's a reason we make plans.

11:25.117 --> 11:26.684
Just relax.

11:26.719 --> 11:28.721
I'm going to get him
to tell me everything he knows.

11:28.756 --> 11:30.723
So why don't
you just do your part?

11:30.758 --> 11:32.690
Enjoy yourself.

11:32.725 --> 11:34.727
I'll be back with the goodies.

11:38.330 --> 11:40.733
Jesse, you copy that?

11:40.768 --> 11:41.934
Loud and clear.

11:42.334 --> 11:43.936
I thought you would've
learned by now not to try to win

11:43.971 --> 11:45.938
arguments with women,
especially not shalimar.

11:45.973 --> 11:47.540
This isn't about an argument.

11:47.940 --> 11:49.942
This is about shalimar
playing as part of the team.

11:49.977 --> 11:51.108
Really?

11:51.143 --> 11:53.145
Some conversation
i've been missing here?

11:53.180 --> 11:55.548
Just monitor her channel, okay?

11:55.948 --> 11:57.750
I'm carrying on with the plan.

11:57.785 --> 11:59.552
Let me if anything
goes sideways.

11:59.952 --> 12:01.954
Aye aye.

12:03.556 --> 12:05.157
<laughing> ooh...

12:05.192 --> 12:06.759
oh, i'm sorry.

12:07.159 --> 12:08.325
Oh, no.

12:08.360 --> 12:10.728
I'll be back.

12:10.763 --> 12:14.331
I'm sorry. I didn't
mean to interrupt anything.

12:14.366 --> 12:18.771
I've been trying to get
out of that conversation
for ten minutes.

12:18.806 --> 12:22.192
I wish i had thought
of spilling a drink.

12:22.227 --> 12:25.578
So you're with
the balkistan mission?

12:25.978 --> 12:27.980
Jerzy novotny.

12:28.380 --> 12:29.982
Trade commissioner.

12:30.382 --> 12:31.984
And you are...?

12:32.384 --> 12:36.353
Sharon carver.

12:36.388 --> 12:41.193
I'm here with my husband.

12:41.594 --> 12:43.961
Oh.

12:43.996 --> 12:46.363
Well, your husband's a fooi...

12:46.398 --> 12:50.002
to let a woman as
beautiful as you are alone.

12:50.402 --> 12:53.571
Why? Is it dangerous in here?

12:53.606 --> 12:57.610
It could be as dangerous
as you want it to be.

13:01.213 --> 13:03.616
Why don't you,
uh, show me around?

13:04.016 --> 13:08.420
I feel safe with someone
like you here to protect me.

13:16.428 --> 13:18.030
This is quite a building.

13:18.065 --> 13:19.997
Yeah.

13:20.032 --> 13:22.034
A holdover from the days when
my government actually had a

13:22.069 --> 13:24.001
budget for things
like embassies.

13:24.036 --> 13:26.438
Well, you don't look like a
man who works well on a budget.

13:26.473 --> 13:28.440
Oh, i see what i need...

13:28.841 --> 13:30.442
and i take it.

13:30.843 --> 13:33.245
And what do you have
your sights set on now?

13:33.646 --> 13:38.415
Something well within my grasp.

13:38.450 --> 13:42.454
Is... is there maybe someplace
a little more private?

13:42.489 --> 13:46.824
What's down that way?

13:46.859 --> 13:50.062
That's where
we keep the secrets.

13:50.097 --> 13:54.066
Can you keep a secret?

13:54.466 --> 13:56.668
Not really.

13:56.703 --> 13:58.871
<gasping>

14:06.879 --> 14:09.682
get her to the car, quickly.

14:41.347 --> 14:46.752
Brennan? What do
you think you're doing?

14:46.787 --> 14:52.157
Hey. I didn't think
you'd ever wake up.

14:52.192 --> 14:55.326
Oh.

14:55.361 --> 14:58.163
What's going on?

14:58.198 --> 15:00.931
Where is this place?

15:00.966 --> 15:05.336
What are we doing in bed?

15:05.371 --> 15:09.775
It's not that odd
for a husband and wife to
be sharing a bed together.

15:09.810 --> 15:12.943
What are you talking about?

15:12.978 --> 15:14.980
We're coming up
on our second anniversary.

15:15.015 --> 15:20.185
It's too late to back out now.

15:25.391 --> 15:27.393
I don't like this joke, brennan.

15:27.793 --> 15:29.795
Oooh, somebody's telling a joke,
i wish they'd share it with

15:29.830 --> 15:32.998
me, because i could
use a good laugh right now.

15:39.004 --> 15:42.207
What happened at the embassy?

15:42.608 --> 15:45.010
There was a
guy there. He shot me.

15:45.045 --> 15:47.230
Don't you remember?

15:47.265 --> 15:49.941
We had dinner here.

15:49.976 --> 15:52.583
At home tonight.

15:52.618 --> 15:59.425
And then we went outside, sat
down and looked up at the stars.

15:59.460 --> 16:02.245
Don't you remember?

16:02.280 --> 16:04.995
Why are you doing this?

16:05.030 --> 16:06.231
Okay, where the hell are we?

16:06.266 --> 16:08.050
What's going on?

16:08.085 --> 16:09.800
And... ahem.

16:09.835 --> 16:13.839
While we're at it, would
you mind putting some pants on,
please?

16:14.239 --> 16:19.444
Huh...
if you think there's something
wrong with the way things

16:19.479 --> 16:24.650
are, then why
don't you tell me the way
things are supposed to be?

16:24.685 --> 16:26.216
What?

16:26.251 --> 16:28.253
Well, you said
we were at an embassy?

16:28.654 --> 16:30.656
Well, what were we doing there?

16:30.691 --> 16:32.257
You know.

16:32.658 --> 16:37.062
Trying to find the people that
took our scientist - rydell.

16:37.097 --> 16:40.265
God, brennan, this
just happened yesterday.

16:40.666 --> 16:44.635
<laughs> who
do you think we are?

16:44.670 --> 16:47.473
And why would be
interested in a scientist?

16:47.508 --> 16:50.641
Why are you asking
me these questions?

16:50.676 --> 16:55.080
Because i'm trying to help
you figure out what's going on.

16:55.115 --> 16:57.082
Who do you think we are?

16:57.483 --> 17:01.852
Who do we work for?

17:01.887 --> 17:04.253
Because there's
something wrong with you.

17:04.289 --> 17:07.893
And unless you sort
it out, you could go crazy.

17:07.928 --> 17:10.913
Shal, where're you going?

17:10.948 --> 17:13.898
To get out of this nightmare.

17:26.712 --> 17:27.913
What?

17:36.722 --> 17:39.089
No... no.

17:39.124 --> 17:45.531
Not there, no...

18:07.953 --> 18:10.756
what are you doing here?

18:11.156 --> 18:13.524
I came to help you.

18:13.559 --> 18:18.764
You can't help me. Nobody can.

18:18.799 --> 18:20.766
I know what's going on.

18:20.801 --> 18:22.985
No you don't.

18:23.020 --> 18:25.135
This isn't real.

18:25.170 --> 18:28.573
Are you tell me
that this is not real?

18:28.608 --> 18:31.977
Somebody did
something to your mind.

18:32.377 --> 18:35.581
I think they wanted
information about your work.

18:35.616 --> 18:40.002
I told him everything
he wanted to know.

18:40.037 --> 18:44.389
But he kept asking
me more questions.

18:44.424 --> 18:47.192
Kept making me run the maze.

18:47.593 --> 18:50.360
You're safe.

18:50.395 --> 18:52.798
There's nothing
here that can hurt you.

18:52.833 --> 18:55.601
You don't understand.

18:56.001 --> 18:59.169
I know this maze.

18:59.204 --> 19:02.207
I don't know
how he knew about it.

19:02.242 --> 19:05.175
It was my first year in college.

19:05.210 --> 19:08.013
A biology project one
of the professors showed me.

19:08.048 --> 19:10.415
He built a maze...

19:10.450 --> 19:13.183
this maze...

19:13.218 --> 19:16.822
he ran the mice through it.

19:17.222 --> 19:20.791
At the end he...

19:20.826 --> 19:26.031
he'd
cut their brains open to see
what chemicals were released.

19:26.431 --> 19:29.199
I was horrified.

19:29.234 --> 19:33.238
It's what made me go into
physics in the first place.

19:33.639 --> 19:36.006
Somehow...

19:36.041 --> 19:41.246
whoever's doing this
knew about that experiment.

19:41.281 --> 19:45.651
They built this
so they can torture me.

19:45.686 --> 19:49.254
I get to the end of this maze...

19:49.289 --> 19:54.825
and i'm a dead man.

19:54.860 --> 19:57.262
You have to listen
to me carefully.

19:57.663 --> 19:59.665
This isn't real.

20:00.065 --> 20:03.634
It's all an illusion.

20:03.669 --> 20:05.636
I assume that includes you.

20:05.671 --> 20:09.274
Just tell me who's
doing this to you.

20:09.309 --> 20:15.280
Who's asking you the questions?

20:15.315 --> 20:17.683
Him.

20:26.892 --> 20:28.458
Oh...

20:28.493 --> 20:32.097
<mumbling>

20:34.499 --> 20:38.103
hey, jesse,
i'm getting worried.

20:38.138 --> 20:39.705
Anything from shalimar?

20:39.740 --> 20:41.271
No, nothing.

20:41.306 --> 20:42.873
But her comlink is still active.

20:42.908 --> 20:44.910
I'm still receiving
her locator signal.

20:44.945 --> 20:46.076
Where is she?

20:46.111 --> 20:48.078
Let me run a search.

20:48.113 --> 20:49.680
She'd be down
the hall to your right.

20:49.715 --> 20:52.117
Get ready to take off in case
we have to make a fast exit.

20:52.152 --> 20:54.920
Okay.

21:08.533 --> 21:11.737
Jess, they got shal. Tell adam.

21:16.141 --> 21:18.108
How did i get here?

21:18.143 --> 21:20.946
Are you sure you
don't need some help?

21:21.346 --> 21:23.749
I'm going to find out what
they did to me at the embassy.

21:24.149 --> 21:28.954
It's not
safe for you to leave in this
confused state, shalimar.

21:28.989 --> 21:30.172
I'm not confused, okay?

21:30.207 --> 21:31.356
I know what's what.

21:31.757 --> 21:34.359
Come on, shalimar.

21:34.394 --> 21:36.962
Tell me. Talk to us.

21:37.362 --> 21:41.331
Talk to all of us.

21:41.366 --> 21:43.368
Sounds like you don't
even know who we are.

21:43.769 --> 21:46.171
Yeah, well, i knew
who you were yesterday.

21:46.206 --> 21:50.575
You were my
partners in mutant x.

21:52.978 --> 21:58.984
Mutant x. Oooh, what a prize.

22:00.585 --> 22:04.589
You're going to
deliver me adam kane.

22:09.394 --> 22:10.961
What are you doing?

22:10.996 --> 22:13.398
I went into rydell's mind.

22:13.433 --> 22:15.766
And?

22:15.801 --> 22:19.004
I saw the guy that's
doing this to him.

22:27.813 --> 22:33.018
There. That's him.

22:37.823 --> 22:40.225
Levak ivanov.

22:40.625 --> 22:42.827
All right. Now this is
starting to make some sense.

22:42.862 --> 22:45.030
Ivanov's a product
of the tretiakova institute.

22:45.065 --> 22:46.596
Which is?

22:46.631 --> 22:49.234
Which is the soviet version
of genomex during the cold war.

22:49.269 --> 22:51.837
Except the russians got smart
about genetic research around

22:51.872 --> 22:53.403
the same time i did.

22:53.438 --> 22:55.841
They clamped down on controls.

22:55.876 --> 22:57.442
So, what are you saying?

22:57.477 --> 22:59.044
That he's a mutant?

22:59.444 --> 23:01.847
Well, might be.

23:02.247 --> 23:04.614
Yes, look.

23:04.649 --> 23:08.618
His kgb profile says
he's a master of interrogation.

23:08.653 --> 23:13.058
Something unnatural was done
to rydell's mind to make him

23:13.093 --> 23:15.025
break that quickly.

23:15.060 --> 23:22.667
And these are the
guys that have shalimar.

23:25.871 --> 23:27.873
Whatever they did with her they
got a twenty-minute head start.

23:27.908 --> 23:29.439
They could be anywhere by now.

23:29.474 --> 23:31.041
Thanks for the
comforting thought.

23:31.076 --> 23:32.677
Listen, scan the satellite
cache records anyway.

23:33.078 --> 23:33.879
You might get lucky, huh?

23:34.279 --> 23:38.283
Ready?
- Uh huh.

23:43.488 --> 23:45.055
Think, shalimar.

23:45.090 --> 23:48.293
Everything you ever
thought was real is a lie.

23:48.328 --> 23:53.498
Where is adam kane, shalimar?

23:53.533 --> 23:57.067
No...
tell me.

23:57.102 --> 24:00.905
Or i'll take everything
away from you.

24:00.940 --> 24:04.709
Just tell us where
you think you are.

24:04.744 --> 24:12.317
Where do you think adam is?

24:12.717 --> 24:17.122
This is a trick.

24:17.522 --> 24:20.290
You don't know.

24:20.325 --> 24:22.292
This is some kind of illusion.

24:22.327 --> 24:24.294
Now, see that's
where you're wrong.

24:24.329 --> 24:26.731
Because for you this is
going to be reality from now on.

24:26.766 --> 24:28.698
Unless you tell us.

24:28.733 --> 24:29.935
C'mon, shalimar. Where is he?

24:29.970 --> 24:31.902
Tell us, shalimar.

24:31.937 --> 24:33.939
Shalimar, where
is he? C'mon, shalimar.

24:33.974 --> 24:35.941
Shalimar, tell us.

24:35.976 --> 24:39.945
Shalimar.

24:41.146 --> 24:42.547
<panting> adam.

24:42.582 --> 24:43.914
Adam! Thank god!

24:43.949 --> 24:45.951
Something's wrong. They
did something to my mind.

24:45.986 --> 24:47.517
Not at all, shalimar.

24:47.552 --> 24:49.955
Everything's exactly
as it should be.

24:56.895 --> 24:58.497
Shalimar, follow me.

24:58.897 --> 25:00.098
Quickly.

25:05.704 --> 25:07.305
Shalimar, i know none
of this makes sense to you,

25:07.340 --> 25:08.907
but you have to believe me
- i'm trying to help you.

25:09.307 --> 25:13.311
You don't want to help us.

25:13.712 --> 25:17.315
You've been trying to capture us

25:17.350 --> 25:20.919
- all mutants
and put us into pods.

25:20.954 --> 25:22.886
That's what adam had you think.

25:22.921 --> 25:26.089
But all this time it
was me trying to help you.

25:26.124 --> 25:28.927
He's
the one who's been manipulating
you all from the start.

25:28.962 --> 25:31.329
No. You're lying.

25:31.730 --> 25:34.933
All this time he's been
using you all to service his own

25:34.968 --> 25:39.703
selfish needs, to
create the perfect mutant.

25:39.738 --> 25:43.341
Why do you think all of your
powers are continuing to mutate?

25:43.376 --> 25:46.945
Each day, bringing you closer
and closer to your own demise?

25:46.980 --> 25:48.547
No. He's coming
up with a cure for that.

25:48.582 --> 25:50.949
Adam's the one causing it.

25:50.984 --> 25:54.518
No. That can't be.

25:54.553 --> 25:58.522
Shalimar. You know it's true.

25:58.557 --> 26:03.361
Why do you think they've
all turned against you?

26:03.396 --> 26:07.365
It's why i'm
trying to protect you.

26:07.400 --> 26:10.969
But you have to help me.

26:11.369 --> 26:16.374
We can't let adam win.

26:16.409 --> 26:21.379
Not now. Not ever.

26:26.184 --> 26:28.952
Tell me where we are shalimar.

26:28.987 --> 26:36.194
I'll have our real friends at
the gsa swoop in and rescue us.

26:36.229 --> 26:39.397
I can't.

26:39.798 --> 26:42.601
You can, shalimar.

26:43.001 --> 26:45.804
If you don't tell
me, we'll both die.

26:45.839 --> 26:49.407
Is that what you want?

26:58.216 --> 27:00.183
Any change?

27:00.218 --> 27:04.622
He's been out
of it for the past hour.

27:04.657 --> 27:08.992
<sighs>
- he's slipping away, isn't he?

27:09.027 --> 27:14.232
Right now, he's the
only lead we have to ivanov.

27:14.633 --> 27:17.836
I can bring him back.

27:17.871 --> 27:19.838
Oh, emma.

27:20.238 --> 27:21.840
Look, i know i asked you to
go in there in the first place,

27:21.875 --> 27:23.859
but you almost
didn't make it out.

27:23.894 --> 27:25.844
I cannot ask
you to do that again.

27:26.244 --> 27:28.211
Adam, shalimar's
life may depend on it.

27:28.246 --> 27:29.848
And if we can break him
free, he may be able to tell us

27:30.248 --> 27:32.215
where they had him.

27:32.250 --> 27:37.055
<sighs>
- i'm not going to sit here
and watch him die.

27:37.090 --> 27:41.024
Emma.

27:41.059 --> 27:44.663
Emma, by entering his
mind you put yourself at risk.

27:44.698 --> 27:47.465
Emma!

27:55.874 --> 27:57.475
We have to get
you out of here now.

27:57.510 --> 27:59.042
No, no.

27:59.077 --> 28:00.243
We gotta get out of here.

28:00.278 --> 28:01.880
That's the end
of the experiment.

28:01.915 --> 28:03.481
Please, you have to trust me.

28:03.516 --> 28:07.102
We're gonna die.

28:07.137 --> 28:10.654
Dominic, wait!

28:10.689 --> 28:15.493
Dominic, i'm trying to help you
but you have to listen to me.

28:15.528 --> 28:19.462
This isn't reality. Think.

28:19.497 --> 28:25.468
Remember what your life is
really like. You're a scientist.

28:25.503 --> 28:30.709
Ivanov did something
to your mind to get
information about your work.

28:30.744 --> 28:33.476
He tried to hurt you.

28:33.511 --> 28:37.115
Now i'm trying to help you.

28:37.515 --> 28:43.922
But i need you to take my hand.

28:44.322 --> 28:49.928
I can bring you back.

29:11.950 --> 29:15.919
You have to.

29:15.954 --> 29:21.159
Because i'm not
leaving without you.

29:45.183 --> 29:47.585
We have to go, now.

29:56.795 --> 29:58.361
<panting>
- emma.

29:58.396 --> 30:00.398
You all right?
What happened in there?

30:00.433 --> 30:03.201
What happened?

30:03.601 --> 30:07.205
We were right. It wasn't real.

30:15.613 --> 30:18.016
Where am i?

30:21.219 --> 30:26.825
Shalimar. Shalimar.
They're coming for us.

30:27.225 --> 30:29.227
Shalimar, you
have to try to think.

30:29.262 --> 30:30.794
Hold on to reality.

30:30.829 --> 30:32.430
Tell me what you believe
to be true and together

30:32.465 --> 30:34.032
we can work out
what's really going on.

30:34.067 --> 30:35.598
Think of specifics.

30:35.633 --> 30:36.835
Do you remember
how we got to sanctuary?

30:37.235 --> 30:41.639
Do you remember
the codes to get in?

30:43.241 --> 30:45.243
No.

30:49.647 --> 30:50.849
I don't remember much.

30:51.249 --> 30:53.216
Do you remember where
you were when you woke up?

30:53.251 --> 30:55.253
Dominic, we think that
the guy who twisted your mind is

30:55.288 --> 30:57.220
doing the same
thing to our friend.

30:57.255 --> 30:59.657
Look, is there anything at
all that sticks out in your mind

30:59.692 --> 31:02.477
about where they held you?

31:02.512 --> 31:05.228
Like a... a smell, or a sound?

31:05.263 --> 31:10.869
I was running, and sometimes
i was seeing flashes of things

31:11.269 --> 31:13.236
that weren't the maze,

31:13.271 --> 31:17.275
but i didn't know what
was real or what wasn't by then.

31:17.310 --> 31:20.478
When i got away,

31:20.879 --> 31:23.281
i remember looking up at the
building and seeing something.

31:23.681 --> 31:25.248
Well, what?

31:25.283 --> 31:26.850
What... what did you see?

31:26.885 --> 31:28.887
Well, this is
going to sound strange,

31:28.922 --> 31:31.106
but i saw a lightning bolt.

31:31.141 --> 31:33.256
A lightning bolt. All right.

31:33.291 --> 31:34.893
So you ask jesse to check
the area around where he was

31:34.928 --> 31:36.459
picked up, all right?

31:36.494 --> 31:38.496
Because with a detail that
specific i think that we can

31:38.531 --> 31:40.498
retrace your footsteps.

31:40.899 --> 31:42.901
Thank you.

31:43.701 --> 31:46.069
Shalimar, calm down.

31:46.104 --> 31:49.707
Tell me what's wrong, shalimar.

31:55.713 --> 31:58.116
I don't
need electricity. I'll just
kill you with my bare hands.

31:58.151 --> 31:59.717
Take your best shot.

32:15.333 --> 32:21.339
You know, you can
be a real pain in the neck.

32:21.374 --> 32:24.507
No.

32:24.542 --> 32:26.544
Shalimar!

32:44.629 --> 32:46.631
It's not real.
None of this is real.

32:57.842 --> 32:59.844
Who are you going to
pretend to be next? My mother?

32:59.879 --> 33:02.647
My first grade teacher?
I hated that bitch.

33:02.682 --> 33:05.450
Aggh!

33:15.460 --> 33:18.262
The building we're
looking for must be within
this four-block radius.

33:18.297 --> 33:20.229
Oh, check it out.

33:20.264 --> 33:22.667
Unless lightning strikes twice,
this could be our place, adam.

33:23.067 --> 33:25.470
Getting any reading from inside?

33:25.870 --> 33:27.437
Yes.

33:27.472 --> 33:29.073
I'm getting reading on
at least five people in there.

33:29.474 --> 33:31.441
Well, whatever else is going on,

33:31.476 --> 33:34.278
this place is definitely
not abandoned.

33:34.679 --> 33:36.280
Well, whaddya say we go
down there to take a look what

33:36.315 --> 33:37.882
they've done with the place.

33:38.282 --> 33:40.284
Let's go.

33:47.892 --> 33:51.095
<panting>
ugh...

34:34.338 --> 34:38.743
are you picking up anything?

34:39.143 --> 34:41.911
She's close. But she's scared.

34:41.946 --> 34:43.547
Well, let's split
up, see if we can find her.

34:43.583 --> 34:46.751
Yeah, let's hope
we're not too late.

35:17.181 --> 35:18.783
That's weird.

35:19.183 --> 35:20.384
Go down that corridor.
I'll check down here.

35:20.785 --> 35:22.787
All right.

35:27.191 --> 35:29.994
<scream>
shalimar, it's me.

35:30.394 --> 35:35.965
What are you doing?

35:36.000 --> 35:38.803
How many times do i have to
kill you for you to stay dead?

35:53.618 --> 35:56.420
What are you doing?
Shalimar, it's us.

35:56.455 --> 35:58.439
You're not real!

35:58.474 --> 36:00.424
You're not real!

36:06.597 --> 36:08.599
Ever since we got here,
i've been getting these strong

36:09.000 --> 36:12.568
feelings of confusion
and... and anger.

36:12.603 --> 36:14.605
Yeah, shalimar's strong,
even with ivanov's mind control

36:14.640 --> 36:17.408
i don't think he'd be
able to break her completely.

36:17.443 --> 36:22.613
Then you underestimate
my powers, mr. Kane.

36:23.014 --> 36:25.381
She's gone.

36:25.416 --> 36:29.385
But it's a shame, really, all
this time i was trying to get

36:29.420 --> 36:34.225
her to lead me
to you, when it seems i had
it the other way around.

36:34.260 --> 36:38.629
A mind is a terrible thing
to waste, don't you think?

36:38.664 --> 36:40.997
You're sick.

36:41.032 --> 36:44.600
Oh, to crawl inside your head.

36:44.635 --> 36:50.241
Your secrets will bring
in a hefty price, dr. Kane.

36:50.276 --> 36:53.044
You first.

36:53.444 --> 36:55.446
Emma, no!

37:06.657 --> 37:10.261
Who's there?

37:17.068 --> 37:18.669
You're not real.

37:19.070 --> 37:23.074
No? I'm as real as
anything else in your mind.

37:23.109 --> 37:27.043
And i'm much more dangerous.

37:27.078 --> 37:30.646
You were stupid to
pit your mind against mine.

37:30.681 --> 37:36.687
Are you sure you don't
have that the other way around?

37:47.498 --> 37:50.701
You know, you
should really learn to stay
out of other people's minds.

37:50.736 --> 37:52.668
Nice trick.

37:52.703 --> 37:56.272
I'll pry it out of you
with the rest of your secrets.

37:56.307 --> 38:02.713
There are things i can do that i
haven't even shown by partners.

38:02.748 --> 38:07.735
And it really doesn't
matter that you're going to see,

38:07.770 --> 38:12.723
because you're never going
to be able to tell anybody.

38:12.758 --> 38:17.145
Ugh!

38:17.180 --> 38:21.532
Agh!

38:25.936 --> 38:29.140
All right. Let's
find the others.

38:44.755 --> 38:46.322
Did you see her?

38:46.357 --> 38:48.359
Yeah, she was right in front
of us. She must be down here.

38:57.968 --> 39:01.172
She's close.

39:01.972 --> 39:02.773
Ugh!

39:03.174 --> 39:04.375
You should've minded
your own business.

39:04.410 --> 39:06.742
Agh!

39:06.777 --> 39:08.779
Shalimar... shalimar...

39:15.186 --> 39:25.996
it's okay. It's okay.
It's over. He can't hurt you.

39:29.600 --> 39:31.602
It's really you?

39:31.637 --> 39:36.407
Yeah.

39:50.020 --> 39:51.222
Well, thanks to you,

39:51.622 --> 39:53.224
it looks like the
nightmare's finally over.

39:53.624 --> 39:55.226
Rydell's going to be fine.

39:55.626 --> 39:59.195
Ivanov's been locked
up in a state mental facility.

39:59.230 --> 40:02.833
I don't think he'll
be getting into anybody
else's head very soon.

40:02.868 --> 40:04.835
Yeah, well, with the blast
i sent him he'll be lucky if he

40:05.236 --> 40:07.638
can ever remember his own name.

40:08.038 --> 40:09.605
You don't have
to enjoy it so much.

40:09.640 --> 40:11.642
Look, he was the predator
and then he was the prey.

40:11.677 --> 40:13.644
He doesn't deserve any sympathy.

40:14.044 --> 40:18.048
If that makes
me cruel, then so be it.

40:18.083 --> 40:20.868
So how's shalimar holding up?

40:20.903 --> 40:23.654
Well, physically, she's normal.

40:24.054 --> 40:26.857
But, psychologically,
you know shalimar.

40:27.258 --> 40:28.824
She says she's fine.

40:28.859 --> 40:30.861
Well, she's never been
one to let her guard down,

40:30.896 --> 40:32.463
i'm sure now more than ever.

40:32.863 --> 40:34.865
Yeah, well, it's
going to take some time
for these scars to heal.

40:34.900 --> 40:37.233
No, they're not going to heal.

40:37.268 --> 40:43.674
She's just going
to learn to deal with it.

41:04.094 --> 41:08.098
Off on another solo
rendezvous into the night?

41:13.304 --> 41:14.870
Something like that.

41:14.905 --> 41:17.708
Well,
i don't have to be a telempath
to get inside your head.

41:17.743 --> 41:20.128
Really?

41:20.163 --> 41:22.513
Tell me.

41:22.913 --> 41:26.517
Well, we all know
you got a wild side, right?

41:26.552 --> 41:28.484
I mean, that's
what we love about you.

41:28.519 --> 41:30.521
It just seems like lately
it's gotten a whole lot wilder.

41:30.921 --> 41:34.089
I guess.

41:34.124 --> 41:38.529
Can you deal with that?

41:38.929 --> 41:45.736
Well, like you said, i don't
have much of a choice, do i?

41:46.136 --> 41:53.344
Don't forget where home is.

41:53.379 --> 41:56.146
I won't forget.
