MAN (on TV):
   Mrs. Carson, I don't think
     we have a lot of time.

01:25.417 --> 01:28.719
WOMAN (crying):
    No. No, Val, no. Please.

01:28.788 --> 01:30.288
Please don't go, Val.

01:30.355 --> 01:34.625
(enormous thud)

01:34.693 --> 01:36.528
(indistinct conversation on TV)

01:39.698 --> 01:42.467
(enormous thud)

01:42.535 --> 01:44.903
(debris falling)

01:47.039 --> 01:48.906
(enormous thud)

01:52.411 --> 01:54.278
(vehicles passing)

02:07.693 --> 02:08.860
Jim!

02:08.926 --> 02:11.896
Hey, hey, Jim, what
          in the world happened?

02:11.964 --> 02:17.969
Well, did you ever have one
       of those mornings?

02:18.037 --> 02:19.837
You know,

02:19.872 --> 02:22.607
the kind when a big steel ball

02:22.674 --> 02:25.743
comes crashing
    through your apartment?

02:25.811 --> 02:27.011
You mean a
                  wrecking ball?

02:27.078 --> 02:29.480
Yeah, yeah, I'll say.

02:29.548 --> 02:31.882
It demolished the place.

02:33.619 --> 02:35.753
They tore down your building
without even warning you?

02:35.821 --> 02:37.222
Well,

02:37.289 --> 02:40.458
you put up
with a few inconveniences

02:40.525 --> 02:44.262
when you live
in a condemned building.

02:44.330 --> 02:46.130
ALEX:
           Hey, Jim,

02:46.198 --> 02:47.732
you look exhausted.

02:47.800 --> 02:50.334
Why don't you go someplace
and get some sleep?

02:50.402 --> 02:52.970
Ah, good idea, Alex.

02:59.912 --> 03:02.146
Good night, Alex.

03:02.214 --> 03:04.115
LOUIE:
        Forget it, Iggy.

03:04.182 --> 03:06.250
You can't stay here.

03:06.319 --> 03:08.052
What-what kind of a guy are you?
                          LOUIE:
                         No way!

03:08.120 --> 03:09.821
No way! No way!
The guy wants
some rest.

03:09.888 --> 03:12.023
Come on, boss, help me out!

03:12.091 --> 03:13.825
He can't sleep in the garage.

03:13.893 --> 03:16.026
Oh. Oh, great, great.
          Boy, you...

03:16.062 --> 03:17.328
You-you want it
from him, huh?

03:17.396 --> 03:19.964
He's the last person in the
world that'd help you out.

03:20.032 --> 03:21.466
I don't want him
         staying here.

03:21.534 --> 03:23.267
Let him stay
   at your apartment, Reiger.

03:23.369 --> 03:26.170
Yeah.

03:28.274 --> 03:30.942
Well, what are friends for?

03:31.010 --> 03:32.210
Yeah.

03:32.278 --> 03:33.678
(laughs)

03:33.745 --> 03:35.680
Why not?

03:35.748 --> 03:37.515
Why not let him
                  stay with you?

03:37.583 --> 03:39.050
Or you?

03:39.118 --> 03:40.318
Or you?

03:40.386 --> 03:43.154
LOUIE:
                         Or you?

03:43.222 --> 03:46.591
Well, now, you're a
            great bunch of pals.

03:46.692 --> 03:48.493
ALEX:
                 One of us would
               love to have him.

03:48.560 --> 03:49.661
Yeah.
                          LOUIE:
                             Oh.

03:49.729 --> 03:50.929
Wouldn't
                      one of us?

03:50.997 --> 03:52.097
Yeah.
                    To have him?

03:52.164 --> 03:53.932
Sure, one
of us would.

03:54.000 --> 03:56.066
So, who's it gonna be?

03:56.134 --> 03:57.235
(wry chuckle)

03:57.303 --> 03:58.836
Hey, Iggy, you'd be
  a good guest, wouldn't you?

03:58.904 --> 04:02.941
Well, sometimes I leave the cap
      off the toothpaste.

04:03.008 --> 04:04.208
Oh.

04:04.276 --> 04:06.311
I forget to wipe my feet,

04:06.378 --> 04:08.313
and I usually scream

04:08.380 --> 04:10.648
for several hours
                    in my sleep.

04:15.220 --> 04:16.253
I don't mind a little screaming

04:16.321 --> 04:18.055
in the middle
of the night. Do you?

04:18.124 --> 04:19.656
What else are friends for?

04:19.725 --> 04:23.961
So... who's taking Iggy home?

04:24.029 --> 04:25.963
Well, I,
            you know...

04:26.031 --> 04:27.732
Well, um...

04:27.800 --> 04:29.267
You-you want
                   to draw lots?

04:29.334 --> 04:30.635
ALEX:
      No. No, no, no, no.

04:30.736 --> 04:31.770
That's not
                    the problem.

04:31.837 --> 04:33.038
That's not the
                   problem, Jim.

04:33.105 --> 04:34.806
The problem is, we'd
           all love to have you.

04:34.874 --> 04:36.441
Yeah.
That's right,
all of us.
              That's the problem

04:36.509 --> 04:39.744
Well, look, let me
make it easy for you.

04:39.812 --> 04:42.814
Iggy, if you had
your choice...
                         Uh-huh.

04:42.881 --> 04:44.315
...of all your friends,

04:44.382 --> 04:49.286
which one would you like
to stay with?

04:49.322 --> 04:52.556
JIM (sighing):
             Uh...

04:52.625 --> 04:57.028
promise there won't
            be any hurt feelings

04:57.095 --> 05:00.398
if I pick my
                     best buddy?

05:00.465 --> 05:03.000
Oy...

05:03.068 --> 05:04.301
Oh, that sounds fair.

05:04.369 --> 05:06.203
That couldn't
be fairer.
             Yeah.

05:06.238 --> 05:07.539
Then it's settled.

05:07.606 --> 05:08.906
I'll be the
                  perfect guest.

05:08.974 --> 05:10.074
It's you, boss.

05:10.142 --> 05:12.109
(funny groan)

05:13.378 --> 05:16.414
Well, that sounds
             like a good choice.

05:16.481 --> 05:17.715
Yeah.
               (Louie grumbling)

05:17.783 --> 05:19.584
TONY:
See you, Louie.
Wait, wait. Wait, wait.

05:19.685 --> 05:21.186
Wait.
See you
later now.

05:21.253 --> 05:22.921
See you, guys.

05:22.988 --> 05:26.523
Thanks for bailing
                   me out, boss.

05:26.591 --> 05:29.126
Hey, dirt face,
   I'm not your best friend.

05:29.194 --> 05:31.261
Oh, yes,
                        you are.
                No.

05:31.329 --> 05:32.797
Look who just came
                 through for me.

05:32.864 --> 05:34.065
No, no, no, no, no.

05:34.133 --> 05:36.868
If we didn't live
                    in a society

05:36.936 --> 05:40.071
that got hung up
                     on the fear

05:40.138 --> 05:42.240
of members of
                    the same sex

05:42.307 --> 05:45.076
sharing mutual
                   affection for
                     each other,

05:45.143 --> 05:47.746
I'd kiss you full
                   on the mouth.

05:47.847 --> 05:49.647
Yuck!

05:51.516 --> 05:55.186
Apparently, the thought
        makes you uncomfortable.

05:55.254 --> 05:58.589
Well, let's forget
                 it and go home.
No, no, no.

05:58.657 --> 05:59.890
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
                     No, no, no,
                     no, no, no.

05:59.958 --> 06:01.092
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,
         yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

06:01.159 --> 06:02.794
Come on, come on,
come on.
         No, no, no, no, no, no.

06:02.862 --> 06:03.961
Relax. Come on.
                     Yeah, yeah,
               yeah, yeah, yeah.

06:04.029 --> 06:05.663
No, no, no.
    Come on.

06:05.731 --> 06:07.365
Hey, get your
                hands off of me!

06:07.433 --> 06:09.100
Okay.
                        Get out!

06:15.274 --> 06:17.374
How's married life, Latka?

06:17.442 --> 06:18.309
Oh, it's fine.

06:18.377 --> 06:19.611
I like it very much.

06:19.678 --> 06:23.047
I like the frequent sex, and

06:23.082 --> 06:27.251
Simka is a very good cook.

06:27.319 --> 06:28.620
She wants me to...

06:28.687 --> 06:33.124
to ask you all you can come
to dinner on June 15?

06:33.192 --> 06:35.126
Why June 15?

06:35.194 --> 06:38.562
Okay, well,
how about tonight?

06:38.597 --> 06:40.398
(Louie grunts)

06:44.303 --> 06:46.570
It wasn't so bad.

06:46.638 --> 06:48.506
We played pool.

06:48.573 --> 06:49.808
We went to sleep.

06:49.875 --> 06:50.975
He screamed.

06:51.043 --> 06:52.977
We went back to sleep.

06:54.980 --> 06:56.147
Uh, what's
                       going on?

06:56.215 --> 06:57.548
Oh, nothing much.

06:57.616 --> 07:00.318
Latka invited everybody
to his house for dinner tonight

07:00.386 --> 07:01.986
with him and his wife.

07:02.054 --> 07:04.722
Oh, boy.

07:04.790 --> 07:07.158
Latka's in really good
       spirits lately, ain't he?

07:07.226 --> 07:09.127
Yeah, he sure
looks happy.

07:09.228 --> 07:11.228
(Jeff chuckles)
          (whistling)

07:11.297 --> 07:13.765
You know, I don't,
            uh, feel out of line

07:13.832 --> 07:15.667
saying this, uh,
                  Jeff, because,

07:15.734 --> 07:17.769
uh, well, we-we,
                   uh, you know,

07:17.836 --> 07:20.604
we worked side by side,
      you know, for a long time.

07:20.673 --> 07:21.973
You become
                   pretty close?

07:22.041 --> 07:23.274
Yeah.
                    Pals?

07:23.341 --> 07:25.743
Um, I think, uh,
              you ought to think

07:25.811 --> 07:28.479
about getting married
              and settling down.

07:28.547 --> 07:31.248
I <i>am</i> married, Louie.

07:31.350 --> 07:34.052
Well, hey,
                congratulations!

07:34.119 --> 07:35.452
When did this happen?

07:35.520 --> 07:38.689
About 11 years ago.

07:38.724 --> 07:39.924
Congratulations again.

07:39.992 --> 07:41.358
And, uh, uh... and, uh,

07:41.426 --> 07:43.961
pass that along
                to missus, uh...

07:44.029 --> 07:47.431
Bennett. My last name
is Bennett, Louie.

07:47.499 --> 07:49.467
I knew that. I knew that.

07:49.535 --> 07:50.802
Phew!

07:50.870 --> 07:53.003
Hey, Alex, it's for you.

07:53.105 --> 07:54.639
Who is it?
         I don't know.

07:54.707 --> 07:56.674
The guy's screaming and sobbing
     so loud, I can't tell.

07:58.477 --> 08:00.444
Hello?

08:01.446 --> 08:02.546
No, no, no, come on.

08:02.614 --> 08:04.515
Come on, Jim.
   Nothing could be that bad.

08:04.582 --> 08:05.683
What is it?

08:05.750 --> 08:07.118
No. Just-just tell me
         what happened.

08:07.286 --> 08:10.922
Ji... Jim, you're
       at Louie's, right?

08:10.989 --> 08:12.924
All-all right,
   I'll, I'll be right there.

08:20.299 --> 08:22.233
(knocking)

08:25.470 --> 08:26.737
Who is it?

08:26.739 --> 08:28.172
It's me, Alex.

08:28.240 --> 08:29.106
Oh!

08:31.076 --> 08:32.610
Hi, Alex.

08:32.678 --> 08:34.245
Hi, Ji...

08:34.312 --> 08:37.548
Oh, my God!

08:39.618 --> 08:41.518
Then it's noticeable!

08:41.620 --> 08:43.754
I knew it!

08:43.822 --> 08:46.890
Jim! Jim! Jim!

08:46.958 --> 08:50.627
What the hell happened here?

08:50.695 --> 08:51.696
Well, it's
                  the old story.

08:51.764 --> 08:52.897
I was smoking in bed.

08:52.965 --> 08:54.298
And you fell asleep?

08:54.366 --> 08:56.300
No. I didn't
               notice the flames

08:56.368 --> 08:58.803
consuming the apartment.

08:58.871 --> 09:00.071
Jim!

09:00.138 --> 09:01.873
I left something
           burning on the stove.

09:01.941 --> 09:03.207
Oh, my God!

09:03.275 --> 09:06.310
Oh, my God in heaven,
             look at this place!

09:06.378 --> 09:08.312
Oh, I-I don't...

09:08.380 --> 09:10.548
What do you think
is gonna happen, Alex?

09:10.616 --> 09:14.118
Do you think
Louie's gonna be upset?

09:14.186 --> 09:17.121
The question is, is whether
          he'll kill you or not.
Oh...

09:17.188 --> 09:18.989
Holy mackerel!

09:19.058 --> 09:20.891
Everything Louie owns
             has been destroyed!

09:20.959 --> 09:23.294
No, no, no, no, no,
        no, no, no, no.

09:23.361 --> 09:24.995
That's not true.

09:25.063 --> 09:26.230
I'll fix it up.

09:26.298 --> 09:27.632
I'll work hard.

09:27.700 --> 09:28.599
You'll help me.
                            Huh?

09:28.667 --> 09:31.102
There's a lot
we can do in a few hours.

09:31.170 --> 09:32.303
What are you
                  talking about?

09:32.404 --> 09:35.173
Uh, some paint,
uh, some wallpaper,

09:35.240 --> 09:37.775
a few flowers
discreetly placed about.

09:37.842 --> 09:39.910
Jim.

09:39.978 --> 09:41.679
It's gonna be okay.

09:41.714 --> 09:43.414
Yeah, well,
               all-all right.
Right, Alex?

09:43.482 --> 09:44.448
Alex, isn't it
gonna be okay?
               Yeah, yeah, okay.

09:44.516 --> 09:45.616
Right, Alex,
tell me it's gonna be fine.

09:45.684 --> 09:47.017
No, no, no, no. Jim,
      Jim, calm down, calm down.

09:47.085 --> 09:48.653
Isn't it gonna be okay,
Alex?
           Calm down, calm down.

09:48.721 --> 09:50.521
Alex, please,
is it gonna be okay?
                       Jim, Jim,
                     Jim, Jim...

09:50.589 --> 09:52.389
Alex.
         Calm... calm... calm...

09:52.457 --> 09:55.059
calm... Now,
                    don't panic.

09:55.127 --> 09:56.194
You hear me?

09:56.261 --> 09:58.229
Don't panic!

10:01.867 --> 10:04.301
You're right, Alex.

10:06.639 --> 10:09.306
The thing to do

10:09.374 --> 10:11.375
is to calm down

10:11.443 --> 10:15.146
and rationally
assess the situation.

10:18.283 --> 10:21.419
Everything's gonna be okay.

10:22.854 --> 10:24.655
(screaming)

10:24.723 --> 10:26.957
No, no, Jim, Jim,
               Jim, please. Jim.

10:27.025 --> 10:28.893
Easy, easy, easy, easy.

10:34.399 --> 10:35.666
(man whistling)

10:35.734 --> 10:37.301
JIM:
   I think I hear him coming.

10:37.369 --> 10:38.469
(whistling continues)

10:38.537 --> 10:39.937
Oh, my God.

10:40.004 --> 10:42.573
(door opening)
             LOUIE:
      Oh, Iggy, I'm home!

10:42.608 --> 10:43.674
What are you cooking?

10:43.742 --> 10:45.142
(groans)

10:50.015 --> 10:51.715
Uh...

10:53.218 --> 10:54.318
Uh, boss...

10:54.385 --> 10:56.020
(clears throat)

10:56.088 --> 10:58.889
...I owe you an apology.

11:00.658 --> 11:05.096
Just keep in mind

11:05.164 --> 11:06.998
that material

11:07.066 --> 11:10.100
possessions
   are simply excess baggage

11:10.168 --> 11:12.302
on the journey of life.

11:14.706 --> 11:18.576
Everything I own
             is destroyed!

11:20.212 --> 11:21.312
(hollow note plays)

11:21.379 --> 11:23.314
(clack)

11:24.950 --> 11:27.785
Louie, Louie, Louie,
Jim had a horrible accident.

11:27.852 --> 11:30.488
I mean, I-I know
it's a terrible loss for you,

11:30.555 --> 11:32.923
but, uh, thank God
nobody was hurt.

11:32.991 --> 11:34.925
What?

11:37.061 --> 11:40.130
Thank God
                nobody was hurt?

11:40.198 --> 11:41.432
Thank God
                   that this man

11:41.499 --> 11:44.468
who just destroyed
      everything I ever owned...

11:44.536 --> 11:46.037
No, no, no, no, no...

11:46.105 --> 11:48.039
...in my life was not killed!
                 Was not killed!
Louie! Louie!

11:48.107 --> 11:50.174
Was not killed.
Not everything
was destroyed, boss.

11:50.242 --> 11:51.942
Not everything.

11:52.010 --> 11:53.010
Louie...

11:53.078 --> 11:54.312
(growling)

11:55.347 --> 11:59.283
I saved your most
prized possession.

12:05.157 --> 12:07.091
See, boss?

12:08.360 --> 12:11.595
Your beloved violin.

12:13.398 --> 12:17.835
JIM:
  The only irreplaceable thing
         in your life.

12:17.903 --> 12:20.671
I risked my life...

12:22.741 --> 12:25.009
...to see that
it wasn't hurt.

12:26.945 --> 12:28.879
My violin.

12:32.518 --> 12:36.387
He treasures that more
  than anything in the world.

12:44.363 --> 12:48.166
Good thing I didn't
save the piano.

12:51.203 --> 12:54.071
Look what you've done!

12:55.140 --> 12:57.908
My apartment...

12:57.976 --> 13:00.511
my life-- everything's gone.

13:01.412 --> 13:04.415
My bumper pool table!

13:04.482 --> 13:07.418
(crying):
My... my rug.

13:09.421 --> 13:11.322
My TV.

13:12.524 --> 13:13.658
(switch clicks)

13:16.728 --> 13:17.828
(switch clicks)

13:23.935 --> 13:27.404
My <i>Time Life</i> books
     on the great lizards.

13:29.975 --> 13:33.677
Ma's needlepoint pillow.

13:34.613 --> 13:36.546
(crying)

13:39.550 --> 13:41.351
LOUIE:
             Oh...

13:42.487 --> 13:45.355
My photographs.

13:48.427 --> 13:50.327
My piano, my-my photographs,

13:50.395 --> 13:52.530
my TV, my books.

13:52.597 --> 13:55.599
My-my bumper pool set
         is destroyed!

13:55.701 --> 13:57.401
Not all of it, boss.

13:57.469 --> 14:00.404
These two pool balls
are okay.

14:00.472 --> 14:01.838
Don't cry, boss.

14:01.907 --> 14:03.907
Please, don't cry.

14:03.909 --> 14:05.242
Here.

14:06.311 --> 14:08.145
(screams)
Oh!

14:09.248 --> 14:11.415
Out!

14:11.483 --> 14:13.284
Get out! Out! Get out!

14:13.352 --> 14:15.286
I never want to see your face
             again.
Boss...

14:15.354 --> 14:16.620
You're fired!

14:16.688 --> 14:18.622
You're fired!

14:23.962 --> 14:26.597
Hey, Lou, Lou...

14:26.698 --> 14:27.697
I mean, Lord knows,
     this is a terrible...

14:27.765 --> 14:30.233
You get out, too!

14:30.269 --> 14:32.069
Hey, Louie...
    Out, out, out, out, out!

14:38.910 --> 14:41.845
I can't believe this happened.

14:49.487 --> 14:52.456
Louie, Louie...

14:52.524 --> 14:54.791
Leave me alone!

15:05.370 --> 15:07.270
¶

15:15.947 --> 15:17.848
Boss...

15:21.420 --> 15:24.688
...I feel terrible
      about what happened.

15:28.126 --> 15:30.394
I came here to give you this.

15:32.030 --> 15:34.965
Nothing is gonna
                 change my mind.

15:35.033 --> 15:36.300
Nothing, you
                     understand?

15:36.368 --> 15:37.868
Now get out of here!

15:42.140 --> 15:44.908
Guess I'll go and get my things.

15:47.745 --> 15:49.679
Boy...

15:49.747 --> 15:52.782
I'm really gonna miss
          this place.

15:55.687 --> 15:58.455
It was wonderful
working with you guys.

15:58.523 --> 16:00.057
Okay, Jim.

16:00.124 --> 16:02.225
Hey, Jim...
              Huh?

16:02.361 --> 16:04.194
We'll try to find something
       for you, you know,

16:04.262 --> 16:06.096
like a-a another job or, uh...
TONY:
Yeah.

16:07.098 --> 16:10.100
Well... nah.

16:10.168 --> 16:13.103
It's back in the
                 streets for me.

16:13.171 --> 16:15.105
Don't you see?

16:17.275 --> 16:20.877
I was a success here
         not because of the job,

16:20.945 --> 16:23.446
but because of that
                 man over there.

16:24.416 --> 16:26.316
He yelled at me.

16:26.384 --> 16:28.285
He abused me,

16:28.353 --> 16:30.588
but he made me work!

16:31.989 --> 16:35.426
Where else am I gonna
          find a guy like Louie?

16:35.494 --> 16:39.129
Try Amityville.

16:41.132 --> 16:44.134
Louie, aren't you even
             gonna look at this?

16:44.202 --> 16:45.636
No!

16:45.704 --> 16:47.638
JIM:
If you won't read it,

16:47.706 --> 16:49.640
at least let Alex
read it to you.

16:49.708 --> 16:52.109
If it touches you, good.

16:52.210 --> 16:55.045
If it doesn't,
               not another word.

16:55.147 --> 16:57.414
I'll just disappear.

16:57.482 --> 16:58.616
"Dear Boss"...

16:58.683 --> 17:01.484
(harmonica playing)

17:04.455 --> 17:05.556
"Dear Boss.

17:05.623 --> 17:07.558
"I always...

17:08.893 --> 17:12.029
"I always swore I'd never
ask my father for money,

17:12.097 --> 17:14.164
"even though he has a lot...

17:17.301 --> 17:18.769
"...but I hoped in some way,

17:18.836 --> 17:20.936
"money might make up
for your loss.

17:21.005 --> 17:22.939
"So, even if you
never forgive me,

17:23.007 --> 17:25.842
"I hope you'll accept
the enclosed check.

17:25.910 --> 17:28.145
"With all best wishes for you,

17:28.180 --> 17:31.448
"dictated but not read,
       James Ignatowski."

17:31.483 --> 17:33.550
Hey, look at this,
    there's a check...

17:33.617 --> 17:36.353
Hey, Jim, I don't want
to criticize your old man,

17:36.421 --> 17:37.855
but what good
is this check?

17:37.923 --> 17:40.290
I mean, he signed it, but he
forgot to fill in the amount.

17:40.358 --> 17:42.693
A blank check?

17:42.761 --> 17:43.994
(thump)

17:44.061 --> 17:45.829
Let me see that!

17:45.897 --> 17:48.165
You can't give a blank
                 check to Louie!
         Give me that.

17:48.233 --> 17:50.033
That's okay, Elaine.

17:50.101 --> 17:53.036
Dad said Louie

17:53.104 --> 17:56.140
could make it out
             for whatever amount

17:56.207 --> 17:59.376
he thought was fair.

17:59.444 --> 18:02.679
I told dad he could trust
your sense of honor.

18:05.750 --> 18:07.684
That he can.

18:13.258 --> 18:14.691
Would you believe it?

18:14.759 --> 18:17.093
I'm salivating.

18:17.161 --> 18:20.597
Ha, I'm actually salivating.

18:22.634 --> 18:24.635
Boss?
      Yeah.

18:24.703 --> 18:26.570
Does that mean
                 you forgive me?

18:26.638 --> 18:27.971
I forgive you, Iggy.

18:28.039 --> 18:29.306
Can I have
                    my job back?

18:29.374 --> 18:30.774
You can have
your job back.

18:30.842 --> 18:32.409
Does it mean
              you love me again?

18:32.511 --> 18:34.044
I didn't love you before.

18:34.111 --> 18:35.779
It's like old times.

18:37.782 --> 18:41.051
Boss, you just
             make out that check

18:41.118 --> 18:43.053
for whatever
                amount you want.

18:43.120 --> 18:44.087
Except...

18:44.256 --> 18:45.422
Except? What except?

18:45.490 --> 18:46.557
How come except?

18:46.625 --> 18:49.126
Except that I have
        to call my dad,

18:49.193 --> 18:51.929
and tell him the amount
      so he can cover it.

18:51.963 --> 18:53.830
Mmm.

18:53.899 --> 18:55.832
Yeah.

18:55.901 --> 18:57.968
All right.

18:58.035 --> 19:01.472
Ah, now I want complete silence

19:01.539 --> 19:05.342
while I figure out...

19:05.410 --> 19:07.344
the amount.

19:07.445 --> 19:10.047
(growling)

19:12.117 --> 19:14.184
(growling)

19:14.252 --> 19:16.420
Jim! Are you crazy?

19:16.488 --> 19:18.955
He's gonna fill that out
          for a million dollars!

19:19.023 --> 19:21.792
That's why you're a cabdriver,
            Reiger.

19:21.860 --> 19:24.795
If I fill this check out
      for a million bucks,

19:24.863 --> 19:27.197
his dad would never cover it.

19:27.232 --> 19:28.966
But there is
a figure,

19:29.033 --> 19:31.969
an exact figure,

19:32.037 --> 19:34.972
one that's big enough

19:35.040 --> 19:37.007
so that he'll go...

19:37.075 --> 19:38.676
(shudders)

19:40.045 --> 19:44.982
...but not so big
   that he won't say, "Well!"

19:46.551 --> 19:50.386
Why don't you try
                the real figure,
               $8,000 or $9,000?

19:50.454 --> 19:52.355
(laughs hysterically)

19:58.763 --> 20:00.730
ELAINE:
                    Look at him.

20:00.799 --> 20:03.133
Eight or nine,
eight or nine...

20:03.235 --> 20:05.402
Jim, why are
                   you laughing?

20:05.470 --> 20:07.704
'Cause the boss
              is so happy.

20:07.772 --> 20:09.539
Yeah, yeah!

20:09.608 --> 20:11.508
Let's see what we got here,
             Iggy.

20:11.576 --> 20:12.442
Come on.

20:12.510 --> 20:14.511
(mumbling)

20:14.579 --> 20:16.313
All right.

20:16.380 --> 20:17.414
All right, now.

20:17.482 --> 20:18.849
$50,000.

20:18.917 --> 20:20.651
No, no, no,

20:20.752 --> 20:22.285
that's too high,
        that's too high.

20:22.353 --> 20:24.288
He'll never go
                for that. Never.

20:24.389 --> 20:25.588
40... 48.

20:25.656 --> 20:27.925
If I say 48,
                 he'll think 50,

20:27.992 --> 20:29.759
and he won't
                      go for it.
    Uh-huh.

20:29.828 --> 20:31.161
If I say 47,

20:31.229 --> 20:32.629
he'll think 48,
        he'll think 50,

20:32.697 --> 20:33.931
he won't go for it.

20:33.999 --> 20:36.199
If I say 46,
                 he'll think 47,

20:36.267 --> 20:37.868
he'll think 48,
                 he'll think 50,

20:37.936 --> 20:39.302
he won't go for it.

20:39.370 --> 20:40.604
If I say 45,

20:40.606 --> 20:42.673
he'll say 46...
             Louie!

20:42.740 --> 20:44.508
So, we rule
                    out the 40s.

20:46.244 --> 20:50.514
39,999.

20:50.582 --> 20:51.848
No!

20:51.916 --> 20:53.683
It's no good! It's too high.

20:53.751 --> 20:54.851
He'll go nuts.

20:54.919 --> 20:55.885
He won't pay it.

20:55.953 --> 20:56.920
All right.

20:56.988 --> 20:59.189
Now, let's see.

20:59.257 --> 21:02.392
$24,000.

21:02.460 --> 21:04.728
$8,000.

21:04.796 --> 21:06.396
In there,

21:06.464 --> 21:08.398
somewhere in there,

21:08.466 --> 21:11.034
24... eight.

21:11.136 --> 21:13.570
You know, in its own way,
 this is kind of spellbinding.

21:14.405 --> 21:18.074
All right, $20,000...

21:18.142 --> 21:19.576
20,000...

21:19.644 --> 21:21.745
$26,000.

21:21.813 --> 21:23.446
Oh, wait a minute!

21:23.515 --> 21:24.715
14,000!

21:24.783 --> 21:26.850
And here,

21:26.918 --> 21:28.084
24.

21:28.152 --> 21:28.885
Wait!

21:29.020 --> 21:30.286
27,000!

21:30.354 --> 21:32.222
27,000, that's it!

21:32.324 --> 21:33.156
Call your father.

21:33.224 --> 21:35.358
$27,000. That's it!

21:35.360 --> 21:36.326
TONY:
            Are you sure, Louie?

21:36.393 --> 21:38.295
I-I gotta see it on paper.

21:39.363 --> 21:42.299
$27,000.

21:42.366 --> 21:44.301
What's that look like to you,
             Banta?

21:44.368 --> 21:47.371
I've never seen
                 that much money
            in one place before.

21:47.438 --> 21:48.639
It's too much.

21:48.706 --> 21:50.407
He'll never pay that.
          Wait! Wait!

21:50.474 --> 21:51.675
Wait! Wait.

21:51.743 --> 21:53.977
24,000...

21:54.045 --> 21:55.912
23,000...

21:55.980 --> 21:57.314
22,000...

21:57.382 --> 21:58.415
20...

21:58.417 --> 22:00.350
20...

22:00.418 --> 22:02.352
27,000! 27!

22:02.387 --> 22:04.354
It's what I said
      the first time! 27.

22:04.389 --> 22:05.855
Tell him 27.

22:05.924 --> 22:07.724
27,000.

22:09.828 --> 22:11.595
29,000.

22:11.663 --> 22:14.264
29,000.

22:14.332 --> 22:16.433
540.

22:16.501 --> 22:19.436
540.

22:19.504 --> 22:21.738
That's right.

22:21.805 --> 22:23.873
Twenty-nine thousand...

22:23.941 --> 22:25.342
five hundred
and forty.

22:25.410 --> 22:26.610
Two!
Two!

22:26.612 --> 22:30.680
Uh, twenty-nine thousand
          five hundred

22:30.749 --> 22:33.249
and forty-two.

22:34.585 --> 22:36.486
Okeydoke.

22:36.554 --> 22:37.754
Bye, Dad.

22:37.822 --> 22:40.757
Uh, Dad, I love you.

22:40.825 --> 22:41.925
(phone clicks)

22:41.993 --> 22:43.927
Hello?

22:44.996 --> 22:46.930
Hello?

22:48.900 --> 22:49.967
Huh? Did he okay it?

22:50.068 --> 22:51.868
He sure did, boss.
                   He okayed it!

22:51.936 --> 22:53.369
He okayed it!
Congratulations!

22:53.438 --> 22:55.605
He okayed it!

22:55.673 --> 22:58.475
Let's have three cheers
for the human torch!

22:58.543 --> 23:00.109
(three puffs)

23:01.446 --> 23:02.379
Phew!

23:02.447 --> 23:04.381
Boy, dad was relieved!

23:04.449 --> 23:06.550
He said he was afraid

23:06.617 --> 23:09.319
it was gonna be something
like $200,000.

23:09.387 --> 23:10.654
(grunts)

23:13.558 --> 23:14.557
Look at him.

23:14.625 --> 23:16.426
He's overcome with emotion,

23:16.493 --> 23:18.428
just like I am.

23:18.495 --> 23:19.897
Damn it!

23:19.964 --> 23:23.466
That kiss is gonna happen
  sometimes, and you know it.

23:24.769 --> 23:26.903
Get over here.

23:26.971 --> 23:29.306
Come on, come on.

23:29.373 --> 23:30.540
Come on,
                        come on.

23:30.608 --> 23:32.676
Come on.
(mumbles) ...2,000.

23:32.678 --> 23:34.410
Let the world talk.

23:34.479 --> 23:36.212
Come on.

23:36.280 --> 23:38.048
Get away from me!

23:47.859 --> 23:50.427
(theme song playing)

24:13.618 --> 24:14.918
WOMAN:
    <i>Good night, Mr. Walters!</i>

24:14.986 --> 24:15.986
(man grumbling)
