00:01.369 --> 00:01.569
.

00:01.602 --> 00:01.802
- Hey.

00:02.836 --> 00:05.506
- Hi.

00:05.539 --> 00:08.209
- Welcome to
the Firehouse 51 family,

00:08.242 --> 00:09.577
Hope Jacquinot.

00:09.610 --> 00:11.612
- What's going on?
- I was hoping

00:11.645 --> 00:13.147
that you'd be happy.

00:13.181 --> 00:14.748
- I just got a call from
Fowlerton.

00:14.782 --> 00:16.684
Did you know
that your friend Hope

00:16.717 --> 00:20.821
stole ten grand
from her last boss?

00:20.854 --> 00:23.391
- That rope rescue was like
nothing I've ever seen,

00:23.424 --> 00:26.460
which is why I've recommended
you for a meritorious promotion.

00:26.494 --> 00:29.830
- Congratulations,
Captain Casey.

00:29.863 --> 00:32.200
- 400. Replica.

00:32.233 --> 00:35.336
Eh, you're better off picking up
at Navy Pier for pocket change.

00:35.369 --> 00:38.406
Okay? Heh, yeah,
you're very welcome.

00:38.439 --> 00:40.208
- Uh, hi. I'm Gabriela Dawson.

00:40.241 --> 00:42.743
I called the other day.
I'm with the fire department.

00:42.776 --> 00:44.645
- Gabriela Dawson.

00:44.678 --> 00:45.813
If you don't mind me saying,

00:45.846 --> 00:49.750
this one took some shoe leather.

00:49.783 --> 00:51.452
- I hope it wasn't
too much trouble.

00:51.485 --> 00:52.820
- Are you kidding?
It's just the kind of

00:52.853 --> 00:55.356
challenge I live for.

00:57.725 --> 00:58.826
- It's perfect.

00:58.859 --> 01:01.229
- [laughs]
A gift?

01:01.262 --> 01:03.431
- Uh, for my husband.

01:03.464 --> 01:04.632
Today's a big day for him.

01:05.466 --> 01:08.469
I wanna make sure
it's one he'll remember.

01:12.906 --> 01:15.676
- What's up, lady?

01:15.709 --> 01:17.345
- Are you in trouble?

01:17.378 --> 01:22.716
Something to do with stealing,
like, $10,000?

01:22.750 --> 01:24.552
- Did my old boss call you?

01:24.585 --> 01:27.821
- Yeah, he talked to Connie.

01:27.855 --> 01:31.259
- The two of us had an affair.

01:31.292 --> 01:33.161
I don't know why I did it.

01:33.194 --> 01:34.628
I didn't realize it
when we started,

01:34.662 --> 01:36.730
but he was in
this mid-life meltdown,

01:36.764 --> 01:38.432
Into all sorts of trouble,

01:38.466 --> 01:39.800
and when his wife
found out, he freaked

01:39.833 --> 01:41.502
He tried to blame me
for everything.

01:41.535 --> 01:43.604
I mean, obviously, I didn't
steal any money.

01:43.637 --> 01:45.806
'Cause he would've
called the police.

01:45.839 --> 01:47.708
You know Fowlerton.

01:47.741 --> 01:51.445
Once the hens start clucking,
facts don't matter.

01:51.479 --> 01:53.714
- I--I didn't realize.

01:53.747 --> 01:55.716
- I'm so sorry.
Does this screw you up?

01:55.749 --> 01:59.187
- No, it's just--
it's awkward.

01:59.220 --> 02:00.854
- I'll talk to Connie right now
and quit.

02:00.888 --> 02:02.656
- No, no. Hope, don't.

02:02.690 --> 02:05.393
I--I came to Chicago running
away from a bad situation.

02:05.426 --> 02:07.195
I--I get it.

02:07.228 --> 02:09.930
I just wish you had
said something sooner.

02:09.963 --> 02:11.699
- Yeah.

02:11.732 --> 02:13.401
- I'll talk to Connie.

02:13.434 --> 02:15.769
Just hang tight.

02:16.737 --> 02:20.441
- Thanks.
You're the best, Sylvie.

02:20.474 --> 02:22.676
- I didn't realize you were
taking the morning off.

02:22.710 --> 02:23.911
- Yeah, I had to run
a few errands

02:23.944 --> 02:25.713
before the promotion ceremony.

02:25.746 --> 02:27.815
I'm at the supermarket
shopping for the party.

02:27.848 --> 02:30.218
- What's your ETA?
Ceremony's at 2:00.

02:30.251 --> 02:32.520
- Uhh, I'll be there
an hour before.

02:32.553 --> 02:33.954
I promise.
- Okay.

02:33.987 --> 02:35.323
[crumbling]

02:35.356 --> 02:37.525
[jackhammer pounding]

02:41.262 --> 02:42.796
- Hey, babe. I gotta call you
back, okay? Love you.

02:42.830 --> 02:44.698
- All right. Bye.

02:44.732 --> 02:47.701
[tense music]

02:47.735 --> 02:48.969
*

02:49.002 --> 02:51.171
[jackhammer pounding]

02:52.273 --> 02:54.542
Hey!

02:54.575 --> 02:56.444
- What's up, hon?

02:56.477 --> 02:59.413
- I'm a firefighter.
Gabriela Dawson, Firehouse 51.

02:59.447 --> 03:01.215
- And?
- And your construction

03:01.249 --> 03:03.317
is causing collateral damage
in the garage.

03:03.351 --> 03:04.752
- I'm sorry,
what are you saying?

03:04.785 --> 03:06.587
- You've got crumbling concrete.

03:06.620 --> 03:08.256
You can't keep the place open
to the public.

03:08.289 --> 03:09.690
- [scoffs]
How 'bout this?

03:09.723 --> 03:11.492
How 'bout you let me
do my job

03:11.525 --> 03:13.727
and if my toaster catches fire,
I'll give you a call.

03:13.761 --> 03:15.396
[horn honks]

03:15.429 --> 03:17.531
- Hey, stop, stop.
Sorry, garage is closed.

03:17.565 --> 03:18.899
- What the hell do you think
you're doing, lady?

03:18.932 --> 03:21.435
- It's a hazard.

03:23.504 --> 03:25.273
- Hey, lady!

03:25.306 --> 03:28.376
- You guys gotta leave,
the structure's not safe.

03:28.409 --> 03:30.010
Everyone out of the garage.

03:30.043 --> 03:31.612
- Get security.

03:31.645 --> 03:33.013
Tell him
there's some crazy chick

03:33.046 --> 03:36.284
yelling at people,
down at the lower level.

03:36.317 --> 03:38.452
- Anybody down here?

03:40.354 --> 03:42.590
[rumbling, cracking]

03:42.623 --> 03:44.992
It's coming down!

03:53.334 --> 03:55.303
[car alarms wailing faintly]

03:55.336 --> 03:57.305
[crackling]

03:57.338 --> 04:00.308
[tense music]

04:00.341 --> 04:04.312
*

04:04.345 --> 04:08.916
Mm.
[coughing]

04:11.919 --> 04:14.588
[wires crackling]

04:14.622 --> 04:16.824
[grunts]

04:17.991 --> 04:21.362
- [moaning]

04:26.367 --> 04:27.868
- Ah.

04:27.901 --> 04:30.304
Mm.

04:34.908 --> 04:38.979
It's okay.
It's okay.

04:39.012 --> 04:41.649
It's okay. Breathe.
I got you.

04:41.682 --> 04:44.385
I got you.
Can you hear me?

04:44.418 --> 04:47.555
Blink once for yes.

04:47.588 --> 04:50.358
Okay. We need to
get you some help.

04:50.391 --> 04:52.693
Where's your radio?

05:11.412 --> 05:13.747
Try not to move.

05:14.782 --> 05:17.050
- Hey! Someone injured?

05:17.084 --> 05:18.419
- Yeah, head trauma.

05:18.452 --> 05:19.920
Compound cranial fracture.

05:19.953 --> 05:22.756
- Okay, okay, just stay here.
- [groans]

05:22.790 --> 05:23.924
- You a nurse?

05:23.957 --> 05:25.426
- Firefighter-paramedic.

05:25.459 --> 05:26.660
Gabby Dawson.
- Will Tucker.

05:26.694 --> 05:28.061
Staff sergeant, U.S. Army.

05:28.095 --> 05:29.530
I got some basic
life support training.

05:29.563 --> 05:31.131
Anything I can do to help?

05:31.164 --> 05:33.501
- Try to keep his head
in one piece until help arrives.

05:33.534 --> 05:35.669
- Like this?

05:35.703 --> 05:37.405
- Perfect.
Have you seen head wounds

05:37.438 --> 05:38.972
in the field?
- No, ma'am.

05:39.006 --> 05:40.941
Been stateside my whole career.

05:40.974 --> 05:42.743
- Hey, what's your name?

05:42.776 --> 05:46.447
- Gil...Scanlon.
I just started as a teller.

05:46.480 --> 05:47.881
- I need your coat and tie.

05:47.915 --> 05:49.950
- Right--right.
Oh--oh, yeah, sure.

05:49.983 --> 05:53.153
*

05:53.186 --> 05:55.789
Here.

06:01.562 --> 06:02.996
- Gil, you should go.

06:03.030 --> 06:04.665
Get out while you still can.

06:04.698 --> 06:07.167
- Ramp's caved in.
Stairs are blocked.

06:07.200 --> 06:08.836
There's an elevator,
but it's shot, too.

06:08.869 --> 06:10.638
And there's no cell service
down here.

06:10.671 --> 06:13.674
- [choking, gurgling]

06:15.876 --> 06:17.545
- What's happening?
What do you need?

06:17.578 --> 06:21.048
- Uh--tools I don't have.

06:21.081 --> 06:22.983
He needs to be intubated.

06:23.016 --> 06:25.453
Nothing else I can do.

06:30.958 --> 06:32.993
[sighs]
Damn it.

06:33.026 --> 06:35.028
We lost him.
- Oh, my God.

06:35.062 --> 06:38.065
We're gonna die down here.

06:41.902 --> 06:44.505
- Decide fire fighting
was too much work for you?

06:44.538 --> 06:46.640
- Please.
Ambo gets more calls in a shift

06:46.674 --> 06:48.676
than squad does in a week.

06:48.709 --> 06:52.780
Just covering for Dawson while
she's out running an errand.

06:52.813 --> 06:54.582
- That's a good look on you.

06:54.615 --> 06:57.184
- Go read your paper.

06:57.217 --> 06:58.586
- Get out of here.

06:58.619 --> 07:00.554
Are you ready for this?

07:00.588 --> 07:02.055
- Born ready.
- I am psyched.

07:02.089 --> 07:03.624
Dawson's always raved,
said you were

07:03.657 --> 07:04.725
a superstar medic.

07:04.758 --> 07:06.760
- Ehh, I got some moves.

07:06.794 --> 07:10.731
Ah, is there anything I need to
know specific to 61?

07:10.764 --> 07:13.934
- Um, expect a frequent flier
named Donnie around noon.

07:13.967 --> 07:15.936
- Uh-huh.
- And we always start

07:15.969 --> 07:17.871
every shift
with Do-Rite Donuts.

07:17.905 --> 07:19.607
- I was waiting for
that second part.

07:19.640 --> 07:23.210
- Yeah.
- Hey, Sylvie?

07:23.243 --> 07:25.613
- Hey, Hope.
Uh, can you call HQ?

07:25.646 --> 07:26.980
Let 'em know we got
a few empty

07:27.014 --> 07:28.982
O2 bottles
here for pickup.

07:29.016 --> 07:31.118
Just--Chief doesn't like them
sitting around for too long.

07:31.151 --> 07:33.186
- Absolutely. I'm on it.

07:35.222 --> 07:37.024
- What's she so bubbly about?

07:37.057 --> 07:39.092
- It's a long story.

07:45.833 --> 07:47.735
- HQ needs these
before the ceremony.

07:47.768 --> 07:50.170
- It's in three hours.

07:50.203 --> 07:51.839
Thanks.

07:51.872 --> 07:54.508
- Oof. Big day.

07:54.542 --> 07:56.577
- [sighs] I've barely had
a chance to let it sink in,

07:56.610 --> 07:58.211
all this last minute red tape.

07:58.245 --> 08:00.147
- Better get used to that...

08:00.180 --> 08:02.249
Sir.

08:02.282 --> 08:04.952
Captain.
[laughs]

08:07.721 --> 08:09.523
- [sighs]
- Hey! Hey, get out of there.

08:09.557 --> 08:11.692
Get out of there--uh!

08:11.725 --> 08:13.226
Hey--
- Get your hands off me!

08:13.260 --> 08:14.728
- Stay right there.
- Hey.

08:14.762 --> 08:16.063
What's going on?
- This one was

08:16.096 --> 08:17.665
trying to loot my truck.

08:17.698 --> 08:18.732
Caught him in the act.
- Looting?

08:18.766 --> 08:20.000
I saw the CB radio inside.

08:20.033 --> 08:21.635
I was trying to call for help.

08:21.669 --> 08:22.903
- Thug's just looking
for an excuse

08:22.936 --> 08:24.271
to break into
my property.

08:24.304 --> 08:26.006
- Thug?
Did you call me a thug?

08:26.039 --> 08:27.307
- Hey, hey! That's enough.
- Come on, man.

08:27.340 --> 08:29.042
She's not worth it.
- Dude,

08:29.076 --> 08:30.544
don't get in my face,
telling me what's worth it.

08:30.578 --> 08:33.246
[rumbling]

08:33.280 --> 08:34.582
- Oh, my God.

08:34.615 --> 08:36.584
- Okay. Only a tremor.

08:36.617 --> 08:38.952
Structure's still settling
after the collapse.

08:38.986 --> 08:40.954
Doesn't mean we're safe, though.
We need to work together.

08:40.988 --> 08:42.723
- She's right.
Could be a while

08:42.756 --> 08:44.992
before we're rescued.
Can't start fighting now.

08:45.025 --> 08:46.927
- I'm a firefighter,
Gabby Dawson.

08:46.960 --> 08:48.128
CFD's on its way.
- But who knows

08:48.161 --> 08:50.864
how long they'll be?

08:50.898 --> 08:52.733
So we need to be proactive.

08:52.766 --> 08:55.769
Scavenge water, first aid,
try and find a way out.

08:55.803 --> 08:57.838
Hey, um--
- Brandon.

08:57.871 --> 08:59.773
- Brandon, why don't you
scout the area?

08:59.807 --> 09:04.945
See if there's a way out of here
we might not have noticed.

09:04.978 --> 09:06.614
Ma'am, ma'am?

09:06.647 --> 09:08.649
Do you mind if I give a shot
at raising someone

09:08.682 --> 09:09.983
on that radio of yours?

09:10.017 --> 09:11.852
- Not at all.
Name's Colleen.

09:11.885 --> 09:13.787
- Thanks, Colleen.
Meanwhile, you can search cars.

09:13.821 --> 09:16.957
See if there's anything
we can use.

09:16.990 --> 09:18.759
- Hey, look.
I don't wanna pick a fight.

09:18.792 --> 09:20.661
But you should really let me
take the lead on this.

09:20.694 --> 09:22.195
- Hey, no ego here.

09:22.229 --> 09:25.065
I saw an opportunity,
took the bull by the horns.

09:25.098 --> 09:28.268
We need you running point
on medical.

09:28.301 --> 09:30.638
Cool?

09:30.671 --> 09:32.873
Good.

09:35.676 --> 09:38.211
- On the scene of
what they're calling

09:38.245 --> 09:39.813
a massive structural failure.

09:39.847 --> 09:41.649
No word yet...
- Yeesh.

09:41.682 --> 09:43.751
How the hell'd that happen?

09:43.784 --> 09:46.186
- Heavy load, fresh concrete.

09:46.219 --> 09:49.322
- Morons.

09:49.356 --> 09:52.025
- So, feeling ready?

09:52.059 --> 09:54.127
- Like rolling a boulder up
hill finishing this paperwork,

09:54.161 --> 09:57.030
but I'm almost there.
- Good.

09:57.064 --> 09:58.999
'Cause there's something
I'd like to do.

09:59.032 --> 10:01.401
I'm gonna start delegating
some duties to you right now.

10:01.434 --> 10:03.804
Help you get acclimated.

10:03.837 --> 10:05.939
- Yeah, absolutely, Chief.

10:05.973 --> 10:07.908
I'm game.
- Excellent.

10:07.941 --> 10:09.843
Okay, everybody,
listen up.

10:09.877 --> 10:11.745
Starting immediately,
Captain Casey

10:11.779 --> 10:14.181
will be your go-to for all
personnel related issues.

10:14.214 --> 10:20.821
Scheduling, furlough, individual
requests from the department...

10:20.854 --> 10:24.124
He's your man.
- Copy that.

10:24.157 --> 10:26.193
- We'll talk later.
I'll get you up to speed

10:26.226 --> 10:27.861
on the latest union moves.

10:27.895 --> 10:29.162
- Hey, uh, Casey,

10:29.196 --> 10:30.964
um, you know, that reminds me.

10:30.998 --> 10:32.800
You wouldn't happen to know
if the department

10:32.833 --> 10:34.735
has any restrictions
on firefighters

10:34.768 --> 10:38.238
submitting themselves
for, um, medical research?

10:47.848 --> 10:50.984
- [sighs]

10:55.222 --> 10:58.225
- You remember me?

10:58.258 --> 11:00.360
- Uh--I'm sorry?
I don't--I don't think so.

11:00.393 --> 11:01.895
- Sure you do.

11:01.929 --> 11:03.196
You work at the bank.

11:03.230 --> 11:05.365
Colleen Wilkes.
I've been trying

11:05.398 --> 11:08.135
to refinance my mortgage.

11:08.168 --> 11:10.137
- I'm sorry, I'm just a teller.

11:10.170 --> 11:14.107
I don't know anything about--
- Your bosses denied me.

11:14.141 --> 11:18.178
Said something like,
"The bank's not a charity."

11:18.211 --> 11:19.713
- [stammering]

11:19.747 --> 11:21.949
- It's funny
'cause after all that,

11:21.982 --> 11:24.151
here we are together.

11:24.184 --> 11:27.254
Level playing field.
- Colleen?

11:27.287 --> 11:29.823
You come across
any first aid kits?

11:29.857 --> 11:31.491
- No.

11:31.524 --> 11:33.894
- Why don't you take
another look?

11:33.927 --> 11:37.865
- [panting]

11:37.898 --> 11:39.232
- Hey.

11:39.266 --> 11:41.201
Breathe slowly, it's okay.
- I know.

11:41.234 --> 11:43.203
I'm trying, I just--
[clears throat]

11:43.236 --> 11:44.437
I just get these panic attacks.

11:44.471 --> 11:45.939
- Do you have any medication?

11:45.973 --> 11:47.941
- Yeah, up at my desk.

11:47.975 --> 11:52.279
Oh, God. Oh, God.
[hyperventilating]

11:52.312 --> 11:54.047
- Hey, hey, hey.

11:54.081 --> 11:55.515
We are gonna get through this.

11:55.548 --> 11:57.818
- Yeah. Yeah.

12:00.120 --> 12:02.422
[radio crackling]
- I got something!

12:06.026 --> 12:07.928
I'm patched into the CFD
channel, I think.

12:07.961 --> 12:10.263
[radio static]
- Bravo side. Assess--

12:10.297 --> 12:11.865
- Hello? Hello?
Can you read me?

12:11.899 --> 12:14.501
- ...Secondary collapse.

12:14.534 --> 12:16.770
- Hello, hello?
Does anyone copy?

12:16.804 --> 12:19.439
- Companies...
Other side--

12:19.472 --> 12:20.941
- They can't hear you.

12:20.974 --> 12:22.776
- Hey! Hey!
[honking horn]

12:22.810 --> 12:24.277
We're here! We're alive!
- Hey!

12:24.311 --> 12:25.445
They're not gonna be able
to hear you

12:25.478 --> 12:26.513
through 15 feet of concrete.

12:26.546 --> 12:27.848
- Everybody be quiet!

12:27.881 --> 12:29.449
- ...holding for MVU.

12:29.482 --> 12:31.151
Imaging.

12:31.184 --> 12:32.920
They're pulling back.

12:32.953 --> 12:34.387
They must've determined
it was unsafe to dig

12:34.421 --> 12:36.023
without imaging.
- How long will that take?

12:36.056 --> 12:37.858
Minutes? Hours?

12:37.891 --> 12:39.392
- I don't know.
[scuffling]

12:39.426 --> 12:41.962
- Oh, hell--

12:43.997 --> 12:45.565
- What is it?

12:59.579 --> 12:59.980
.

13:00.013 --> 13:00.313
- [grunting]

13:04.117 --> 13:05.518
- No, wait, wait, wait!
Hold up.

13:05.552 --> 13:07.287
The car is holding
that pillar up.

13:07.320 --> 13:09.356
And if it falls,
all the pressure will go

13:09.389 --> 13:11.158
to the main support
over there.

13:11.191 --> 13:12.960
No way it holds.

13:12.993 --> 13:14.394
If we're not careful,
we could bring

13:14.427 --> 13:18.265
this entire ceiling down.

13:18.298 --> 13:20.800
- I'll be careful.
- No!

13:28.275 --> 13:30.110
You watch these pillars.
You see any movement,

13:30.143 --> 13:31.444
any shifting at all,
you shout.

13:31.478 --> 13:34.581
Okay?

13:34.614 --> 13:36.349
- [speaking Filipino]

13:36.383 --> 13:39.419
- It's okay, sir.
We're gonna get you out.

13:39.452 --> 13:42.255
We do this slow and steady.
- Yeah.

13:46.894 --> 13:50.263
[both grunting]

13:50.297 --> 13:52.299
- Uh!

13:59.139 --> 14:00.307
- Ah.

14:00.340 --> 14:02.442
[grunting]

14:02.475 --> 14:03.610
- Ah!
- Uh!

14:03.643 --> 14:05.913
- Okay, on three. Ready?

14:05.946 --> 14:08.615
One, two, three.

14:08.648 --> 14:12.119
- [moaning]
- We got you, we got you.

14:16.289 --> 14:18.325
- [sighs]

14:22.162 --> 14:26.099
Sir, can you hear me?

14:26.133 --> 14:29.136
- [speaking Filipino]

14:31.304 --> 14:34.007
- Anybody understand him?

14:36.376 --> 14:38.946
[rumbling]

14:38.979 --> 14:41.381
We need to shore
that pillar up, like, now.

14:41.414 --> 14:43.951
We need lumber, metal rebar,
anything we can scavenge.

14:43.984 --> 14:45.986
We can use seatbelts
to tie it together.

14:46.019 --> 14:48.455
- Or we get proactive.

14:48.488 --> 14:50.223
Dig our way out.

14:50.257 --> 14:52.192
There, where the ramp came down.

14:52.225 --> 14:54.494
- Too dangerous. We don't have
the tools or the expertise.

14:54.527 --> 14:57.164
Our digging could actually
trigger a collapse.

14:59.399 --> 15:00.567
- Let's take a vote.

15:00.600 --> 15:02.235
- No, this isn't a democracy.

15:02.269 --> 15:03.570
- All in favor
of digging our way out.

15:03.603 --> 15:06.439
- You don't understand!

15:15.983 --> 15:19.086
- It's decided.
Let's focus on the main ramp.

15:19.119 --> 15:21.521
Grab all the tools you can find.

15:21.554 --> 15:24.591
Let's go!

15:28.695 --> 15:30.230
- Explain it to me again.

15:30.263 --> 15:32.132
- It's real simple.
Back in '09,

15:32.165 --> 15:34.201
Volkert on first watch
has dental surgery.

15:34.234 --> 15:36.736
I step up, fill in.
Figure I'm doing a solid.

15:36.769 --> 15:38.972
Does he repay? No.

15:39.006 --> 15:41.441
Eight years later,
it is a war of attrition.

15:41.474 --> 15:43.176
I can't blink!

15:43.210 --> 15:44.711
- Mouch, I don't care
who it is.

15:44.744 --> 15:46.546
I just need one of you
to fill in next Tuesday.

15:46.579 --> 15:48.581
- Hey, real quick, grabbing
sandwiches from Lucky's.

15:48.615 --> 15:49.983
You in?

15:50.017 --> 15:51.718
Oh, that's right.

15:51.751 --> 15:54.087
Damn, the Captain's work
never ends, does it?

15:54.121 --> 15:55.688
- Hey, keep it up.
See how it pans out

15:55.722 --> 15:57.557
next time you want
furlough approval.

15:57.590 --> 16:01.161
- Hey, Casey,
do you have a moment in private?

16:01.194 --> 16:03.430
- Yeah. What is it, Capp?

16:03.463 --> 16:05.465
- Not to raise a stink,
but if you go by Cap,

16:05.498 --> 16:07.234
it's gonna be confusion.

16:07.267 --> 16:08.568
You need to emphasize
the "tain".

16:08.601 --> 16:12.339
Cap-tain.

16:12.372 --> 16:17.710
- All right. Listen up.
[sighs]

16:17.744 --> 16:19.579
Let's make something clear.

16:19.612 --> 16:22.415
Starting tomorrow,
I am responsible

16:22.449 --> 16:24.484
for all three shifts
on truck 81,

16:24.517 --> 16:27.320
plus the entire house's
personnel issues.

16:27.354 --> 16:30.323
So please, no more
trivial requests,

16:30.357 --> 16:34.361
and no more surprises.
- There he is!

16:34.394 --> 16:39.232
- Oh, hey! Maxie!
Ooh-hoo!

16:39.266 --> 16:43.436
Hey, honey. Actually,
might not be the best--

16:43.470 --> 16:45.138
- What is this?

16:45.172 --> 16:48.241
- Uh...surprise.

16:48.275 --> 16:50.677
- They've been asked to thank
someone whose hard work

16:50.710 --> 16:53.146
and dedication inspires them.

16:53.180 --> 16:55.582
- Weird.
Didn't pick his old man.

16:55.615 --> 16:57.384
- To thank you for
your service to the city,

16:57.417 --> 16:59.786
we got you a gift.

16:59.819 --> 17:01.488
His name is Mr. Sprinkles.

17:01.521 --> 17:04.491
We think he'd be a very good
firefighter mascot.

17:16.169 --> 17:18.171
- I just wanna clear the air
and say there's absolutely

17:18.205 --> 17:21.408
no truth to this ugly rumor
going around about Hope.

17:21.441 --> 17:24.144
It's--you haven't heard?
- No.

17:24.177 --> 17:26.479
But I'm gonna hear
about it right now.

17:26.513 --> 17:29.116
- So Hope got into a little bit
of trouble back home.

17:29.149 --> 17:31.718
Bad relationship, guy accused
her of stealing some money.

17:31.751 --> 17:33.620
- How much?

17:33.653 --> 17:35.755
- Give or take $10,000.

17:35.788 --> 17:38.791
- Hi-a-watha,
that's a felony.

17:38.825 --> 17:40.260
- Well, that's just it.

17:40.293 --> 17:41.594
I mean, she never
stole anything.

17:41.628 --> 17:42.629
She explained it all to me.

17:42.662 --> 17:44.464
It's just a big nothing.

17:44.497 --> 17:47.634
Small town drama.

17:47.667 --> 17:51.871
- Okay, well, cool, then.

17:51.904 --> 17:53.740
[radio chirps]
- 97, relocate

17:53.773 --> 17:56.876
to the garage collapse,
2800 North Kedzie.

17:56.909 --> 17:58.678
- 61 to main,
we're close to the scene.

17:58.711 --> 18:00.813
You want us to take it in?
- Negative, 61.

18:00.847 --> 18:02.782
We've got what we need.

18:02.815 --> 18:05.285
- Copy.
- Shame.

18:05.318 --> 18:08.221
That would've been a good call.

18:08.255 --> 18:11.524
- [sighs]
[speaking Filipino]

18:26.239 --> 18:29.176
- You okay?
- Oh, it's just a headache.

18:29.209 --> 18:32.545
Queasy.
- [speaking Filipino]

18:38.751 --> 18:40.420
- He keeps repeating that
over and over.

18:40.453 --> 18:42.322
Does it mean anything to you?
- [sighs]

18:42.355 --> 18:44.291
He's still pretty disoriented.
I'm sure he just wants

18:44.324 --> 18:45.625
to get out of here,
same as the rest of us.

18:45.658 --> 18:47.427
- Watch your foot.
[crumbling]

18:47.460 --> 18:51.564
Careful what you're doing.
- You got in my way.

18:51.598 --> 18:53.200
- What happened?
- I told him

18:53.233 --> 18:54.834
he needs to be careful
about what he's doing

18:54.867 --> 18:56.503
but he just yanks
things out.

18:56.536 --> 18:57.870
This is the thing.
They don't learn.

18:57.904 --> 19:00.773
- All right, let's simmer down,
Colleen.

19:00.807 --> 19:02.742
- Yo, I got
a breaking point, okay?

19:02.775 --> 19:05.345
- I'm with you.
She's ignorant, hateful,

19:05.378 --> 19:07.380
and I can't wait
to get away from her.

19:07.414 --> 19:09.816
But she's here and we need her
just as much as she needs us.

19:09.849 --> 19:12.552
- Yeah, sounds nice.

19:12.585 --> 19:13.853
But you should know,
if it comes down to it

19:13.886 --> 19:15.955
and it's me or her...

19:15.988 --> 19:17.457
She's on her own.

19:17.490 --> 19:18.658
- Hey, uh, guys?

19:18.691 --> 19:20.960
He's moving.
Uh, he's moving.

19:20.993 --> 19:22.395
- Sir?
Hey, sir?

19:22.429 --> 19:23.596
Sir, stop!
Sir!

19:23.630 --> 19:27.900
- Oh, no!

19:27.934 --> 19:29.869
- You trying to go up?
That it?

19:29.902 --> 19:34.241
- [speaking Filipino]

19:34.274 --> 19:36.443
- What's that?
Long hair?

19:36.476 --> 19:40.447
A woman?
- [speaking Filipino]

19:40.480 --> 19:42.815
- There's a woman stuck
on the elevator.

19:42.849 --> 19:44.917
- [grunting]

19:49.622 --> 19:51.524
- Watch out.
- Get me out of here!

19:52.925 --> 19:53.893
Help!

19:53.926 --> 19:56.929
- [grunting]

19:58.365 --> 19:59.499
- Help!

19:59.532 --> 20:01.734
- Ah.
- Ah! That's it!

20:01.768 --> 20:03.603
- Daddy?
- Marisol!

20:03.636 --> 20:05.505
- [speaking Filipino]
Get me out of her!

20:10.910 --> 20:11.311
.

20:11.344 --> 20:11.778
- Daddy.
- Marisol.

20:14.714 --> 20:16.549
[speaking Filipino]

20:16.583 --> 20:18.017
- Marisol?
Is that your name?

20:18.050 --> 20:19.819
- Uh-huh.
- Are you hurt?

20:19.852 --> 20:22.722
- No, but my chest is pounding.

20:22.755 --> 20:25.258
I can't--I can't breathe.

20:25.292 --> 20:26.826
I'm having a heart attack.
- No, you're not.

20:26.859 --> 20:28.795
You're having a panic attack.

20:28.828 --> 20:31.364
We're gonna get you out.

20:31.398 --> 20:32.799
Grab one of the jacks
that we found.

20:32.832 --> 20:35.368
It could pry the doors open.
- Yeah.

20:35.402 --> 20:36.736
- I can't--

20:36.769 --> 20:39.906
I can't breathe.

20:39.939 --> 20:41.508
- Can you talk to her?

20:41.541 --> 20:43.042
- Me? Why?

20:43.075 --> 20:44.744
- Well, you know
what she's going through.

20:44.777 --> 20:47.280
Heart palpitations,
shortness of breath.

20:47.314 --> 20:48.981
- Yeah, but I'm not, like,
a professional or anything.

20:49.015 --> 20:50.783
- You are,
in your own experience.

20:50.817 --> 20:52.319
Tell her how you
deal with it.

20:52.352 --> 20:55.822
- Yeah--
- Try, man. It can't hurt.

20:55.855 --> 20:58.691
- Okay.

20:58.725 --> 21:01.027
- Tucker.

21:04.797 --> 21:07.700
- Hi, Marisol. I'm Gil.

21:07.734 --> 21:09.736
I--I know you're freaked out.

21:09.769 --> 21:11.471
And that--that's totally okay.

21:11.504 --> 21:13.473
I am, too.

21:13.506 --> 21:16.008
Just tell me, do you feel
like you can't breathe?

21:16.042 --> 21:17.977
Right.
You can.

21:18.010 --> 21:19.512
You just have to take it slow.

21:19.546 --> 21:22.582
Okay? In.
[inhales]

21:22.615 --> 21:24.351
And out.

21:24.384 --> 21:27.820
And look at your dad.
He's with you.

21:27.854 --> 21:29.956
Good.
- You're doing great, Marisol.

21:29.989 --> 21:31.724
[clanging, electricity crackles]

21:31.758 --> 21:34.561
- Uh, I think that's as far
as we should go.

21:34.594 --> 21:38.097
- That's far enough.
Let's get you out.

21:38.130 --> 21:40.633
- We got you, Marisol.
Squeeze on out.

21:40.667 --> 21:43.536
Okay, slow.
Watch your head.

21:43.570 --> 21:45.805
We got you.
- Ah.

21:48.875 --> 21:51.878
[crashing, creaking]

21:53.513 --> 21:54.947
- We're running out of time.

21:54.981 --> 21:56.383
No way we're tunneling out.

21:56.416 --> 21:57.817
We need to reinforce
that pillar.

21:57.850 --> 22:00.052
Or it will break.

22:00.086 --> 22:01.821
- She's right.

22:01.854 --> 22:03.956
Let's get on it.

22:09.462 --> 22:10.930
[chirps]

22:10.963 --> 22:12.765
- Is he doing anything?

22:12.799 --> 22:14.734
- I'm not sure.
Probably contemplating

22:14.767 --> 22:16.603
the futility of
his own existence.

22:16.636 --> 22:18.104
- Could be worse.

22:18.137 --> 22:19.972
These things are food
in some countries.

22:20.006 --> 22:23.075
What did Casey say?
- Yeah.

22:23.109 --> 22:24.711
He wants him out
by end of shift.

22:24.744 --> 22:26.045
- Why don't you just
take him home?

22:26.078 --> 22:28.515
- What? And break
my kid's heart?

22:28.548 --> 22:30.583
What are you, crazy?

22:30.617 --> 22:31.984
Eh--

22:32.018 --> 22:33.720
Can one of you guys
take him home?

22:33.753 --> 22:35.488
- Allergic.
- Yeah, that's not happening.

22:35.522 --> 22:37.490
- But I might have an idea.

22:37.524 --> 22:39.125
- Yeah?

22:39.158 --> 22:41.561
Hey, looking good, Captain.

22:41.594 --> 22:42.829
- Anyone heard from Dawson yet?

22:42.862 --> 22:45.732
- Not a peep.

22:49.902 --> 22:51.771
- Where'd you find those pipes?

22:51.804 --> 22:56.142
- A plumbing van,
few rows down.

22:56.175 --> 22:59.512
- Hey, uh, thanks
for your help earlier.

22:59.546 --> 23:01.013
We never would've found Marisol
without you.

23:01.047 --> 23:03.616
I--I--I wish
I had realized sooner.

23:03.650 --> 23:05.652
- I work in social services.

23:05.685 --> 23:07.487
Something I learned on the job,

23:07.520 --> 23:08.988
understanding people is hard.

23:09.021 --> 23:11.624
We all jump to the wrong
conclusions at times.

23:11.658 --> 23:14.461
No shame in it.

23:19.799 --> 23:21.033
- How you holding up?

23:21.067 --> 23:22.702
- Calming down.
Thank you.

23:22.735 --> 23:24.604
- Just glad you're safe.

23:24.637 --> 23:27.139
Can I ask, did you try
the emergency phone

23:27.173 --> 23:28.641
when you were stuck in there?

23:28.675 --> 23:31.944
- I tried, couldn't get a tone.

23:31.978 --> 23:33.913
My dad's an electrician, though.

23:33.946 --> 23:36.048
Maybe he can help.

23:36.082 --> 23:37.650
- Talk to him.
If he could fix it,

23:37.684 --> 23:38.651
it would be a game changer
for us.

23:38.685 --> 23:40.453
- Mm-hmm, okay.

23:40.487 --> 23:43.823
- According to initial
reports...

23:43.856 --> 23:45.925
- Can you believe this?

23:45.958 --> 23:49.128
- What, the collapse?
- Yeah. Who's the BC over at 37?

23:49.161 --> 23:51.097
- Uh, Scofield, I think.

23:51.130 --> 23:53.466
- He's all over the place.

23:53.500 --> 23:55.768
Look, you got 63 and 70
right in the collapse zone.

23:55.802 --> 23:58.538
You got guys freelancing
over here on the west area.

23:58.571 --> 24:00.006
They're coming in too hard
from the top.

24:00.039 --> 24:01.774
Got all their eggs
in one basket.

24:01.808 --> 24:05.077
They should tunnel in low
from the north.

24:05.111 --> 24:06.779
Right, Chief?

24:06.813 --> 24:10.082
- Yeah, good eye.

24:10.116 --> 24:13.152
- Hey, uh, worth pointing out,

24:13.185 --> 24:14.787
Chief would totally back you up
if you wanted

24:14.821 --> 24:16.889
to make captain yourself.

24:16.923 --> 24:18.958
We all would.

24:22.662 --> 24:24.731
- I'm in no rush.

24:24.764 --> 24:25.832
[indistinct reporting continues]

24:40.647 --> 24:42.715
- What's wrong?
- Hm?

24:42.749 --> 24:44.617
Oh.

24:44.651 --> 24:49.188
Splitting headache.

24:49.221 --> 24:53.693
- Stay hydrated.
We need you.

24:53.726 --> 24:57.730
- Listen, I'm sorry
I sold you short.

24:57.764 --> 25:00.800
Just felt like I needed--
- Don't mention it.

25:00.833 --> 25:02.569
- What the hell?
- Get away from there.

25:02.602 --> 25:04.771
- [sighs]
What now?

25:04.804 --> 25:06.539
- She's got a secret stash
of water back here.

25:06.573 --> 25:07.974
I caught her hiding one
under this car.

25:08.007 --> 25:09.809
- So what?
I found it myself.

25:09.842 --> 25:11.110
- Going around
calling me a looter

25:11.143 --> 25:12.545
and here she is,
hoarding water.

25:12.579 --> 25:14.213
- I don't owe you a damn thing.

25:14.246 --> 25:15.615
That's the problem
with you people.

25:15.648 --> 25:17.149
You think the world owes you.

25:17.183 --> 25:19.986
- Okay, that's enough.

25:20.019 --> 25:22.722
- Hey! Help!

25:22.755 --> 25:27.093
- What the hell happened?
- He just collapsed

25:27.126 --> 25:28.895
- Gil? Can you hear me?

25:28.928 --> 25:30.963
- I just feel dizzy.

25:30.997 --> 25:33.800
Weak.

25:35.768 --> 25:39.071
- Who else feels weak?
Headachy?

25:44.977 --> 25:47.847
- What is it?

25:47.880 --> 25:50.349
- Carbon monoxide.

25:55.888 --> 25:56.088
.

25:56.122 --> 25:57.023
- We're breathing in exhaust
from somewhere.

25:58.725 --> 26:00.693
Keep him awake, talking.

26:00.727 --> 26:04.631
Anybody got any cash
in their pocket?

26:04.664 --> 26:07.066
- I've got a 20.
What for?

26:07.099 --> 26:10.703
- A lighter.
Somebody, a lighter?

26:10.737 --> 26:12.104
Trust me.

26:12.138 --> 26:16.743
Best money you'll ever spend.

26:20.647 --> 26:23.783
Right here.

26:28.721 --> 26:30.923
I can hear it, too.
The car must have been crushed

26:30.957 --> 26:32.892
during the collapse
with the engine running.

26:32.925 --> 26:34.360
- I can get in there,
kill the ignition,

26:34.393 --> 26:36.095
check to see if
the driver survived.

26:36.128 --> 26:37.964
- I doubt it.
The air's rich with gas.

26:37.997 --> 26:40.633
It'd be a one way trip.

26:40.667 --> 26:43.335
- Let me worry about that.
- Will!

26:43.369 --> 26:48.407
- The only person I'd be putting
at risk is myself.

26:48.440 --> 26:51.811
- Maybe--maybe we can
seal this thing up.

26:51.844 --> 26:54.681
Keep more exhaust
from flowing in.

26:54.714 --> 26:58.050
- Do what you gotta do.
I'm going in.

26:58.084 --> 27:00.720
- Hey--

27:01.988 --> 27:03.756
- What just happened?

27:03.790 --> 27:05.992
Where'd he go?

27:10.062 --> 27:12.699
- To give us a chance.

27:18.270 --> 27:21.207
Let's keep working
to secure this pillar.

27:32.484 --> 27:34.754
- [scoffs]

27:37.056 --> 27:38.825
Hey, Hope.

27:38.858 --> 27:43.696
What did HQ say
about those oxygen bottles?

27:43.730 --> 27:45.197
- I called and left a message
this morning,

27:45.231 --> 27:46.966
but I think I might
have the wrong number

27:46.999 --> 27:49.368
because the voicemail didn't say
anything about CFD.

27:49.401 --> 27:51.337
Thing is, Ms. Donovan left
this ancient notebook

27:51.370 --> 27:54.473
with a million different--
- So no one's coming for them.

27:54.506 --> 27:57.143
- Well, I'm just not sure.
Like I said--

27:57.176 --> 27:59.912
- Yeah, you have an explanation
for all of it.

27:59.946 --> 28:01.347
As usual.

28:01.380 --> 28:02.749
Look, don't sweat it.

28:02.782 --> 28:05.985
I will do it myself.

28:10.122 --> 28:12.358
[tense music]

28:12.391 --> 28:15.895
- [sighs]

28:15.928 --> 28:17.463
- Any sign?

28:17.496 --> 28:19.732
It's been a while.

28:22.001 --> 28:23.770
- Less of an exhaust smell,
though.

28:23.803 --> 28:25.471
He must've gotten it.

28:25.504 --> 28:28.074
Saved our lives.

28:28.107 --> 28:30.009
- Probably on his way back,
then.

28:30.042 --> 28:32.411
Right?

28:35.314 --> 28:40.753
[crashing, rumbling]

28:40.787 --> 28:43.355
- There he is.
Man of the hour.

28:43.389 --> 28:46.125
- Where's Gabby?
She must be proud.

28:46.158 --> 28:48.761
- No idea.
It's getting down to the wire.

28:48.795 --> 28:50.763
I talked to her this morning,
said she was at the supermarket

28:50.797 --> 28:53.365
buying party supplies.
It's the last I heard.

28:53.399 --> 28:55.467
- No, she wasn't.

28:55.501 --> 28:58.938
She called me to make
the supply run as a favor.

28:58.971 --> 29:00.873
She was getting a gift.

29:00.907 --> 29:03.075
- What kind of gift?
Where?

29:03.109 --> 29:06.445
- Uh, antique shop
on Pulaski near Edison Park.

29:09.148 --> 29:11.117
- That's where
that garage collapse is.

29:11.150 --> 29:13.886
- Okay, squad three, truck 81,
ambo 61!

29:13.920 --> 29:15.021
Mount up!

29:15.054 --> 29:18.024
[dramatic music]

29:18.057 --> 29:22.895
*

29:22.929 --> 29:24.163
- Go, go, go!

29:24.196 --> 29:27.166
[siren wailing]

29:27.199 --> 29:34.206
*

29:44.083 --> 29:46.585
- What the hell's that?

29:46.618 --> 29:47.987
- They must've gotten
the green light

29:48.020 --> 29:49.488
from the MVU to start digging.

29:49.521 --> 29:51.123
- That's a good thing, right?

29:51.157 --> 29:52.992
- No. Definitely not.

29:53.025 --> 29:54.526
They're coming in way too hard
at a straight angle.

29:54.560 --> 29:56.228
If they don't stop,
this thing is gonna give.

29:56.262 --> 29:57.964
*

29:57.997 --> 30:00.399
[sirens wailing]

30:00.432 --> 30:04.003
- Casey, look.
That Dawson's car?

30:04.036 --> 30:07.206
- Look alive, everyone.
She's here.

30:07.239 --> 30:14.246
*

30:17.416 --> 30:19.218
- We didn't call
for another alarm.

30:19.251 --> 30:21.520
- We have an off-duty paramedic
who might be around.

30:21.553 --> 30:23.222
Gabriela Dawson.

30:23.255 --> 30:25.024
- That's her car.
If she was around

30:25.057 --> 30:26.859
and saw this incident go down,
she'd pitch in.

30:26.893 --> 30:28.360
- Think she might've been
the bystander that

30:28.394 --> 30:30.062
the construction
workers mentioned?

30:30.096 --> 30:32.231
- Yeah, one of the workers said
some lady was

30:32.264 --> 30:34.633
giving them holy hell about
the garage being a hazard

30:34.666 --> 30:37.636
before it collapsed.
- Sounds like Gabby.

30:37.669 --> 30:39.371
- In that case, she's inside.

30:39.405 --> 30:41.073
- What can we do, Chief?

30:41.107 --> 30:42.508
- You wanna assist
with debris clearance?

30:42.541 --> 30:44.977
- Yeah.
- Absolutely. Guys, form a line.

30:45.011 --> 30:47.379
Let's help clear the debris
from the area.

30:47.413 --> 30:54.420
*

31:07.466 --> 31:12.204
[rumbling]

31:12.238 --> 31:14.506
- We can't hold it.
It's starting to give.

31:14.540 --> 31:16.542
- We don't give up.

31:16.575 --> 31:17.944
We can't.

31:17.977 --> 31:20.512
- [speaking Filipino]

31:25.251 --> 31:26.685
- Sir, we've patched in a call

31:26.718 --> 31:28.154
from the elevator's
emergency line.

31:28.187 --> 31:31.223
It's them.

31:31.257 --> 31:34.060
- Chief Walker.

31:34.093 --> 31:36.262
Yeah, copy.
You hang tight.

31:36.295 --> 31:38.297
It's her.

31:38.330 --> 31:40.066
- Gabby!
- Matt!

31:40.099 --> 31:42.901
- Are you hurt?
[rumbling]

31:45.304 --> 31:48.507
- There's no time!
This place is coming down!

31:53.279 --> 31:55.281
- Don't give up, Gabby.
See if you can make

31:55.314 --> 31:56.548
your way to the north wall.
We're trying

31:56.582 --> 31:58.150
to tunnel in from there.

31:58.184 --> 32:02.254
- North wall, go!
Go, go, don't look back!

32:02.288 --> 32:04.923
Go, go, go!

32:20.973 --> 32:21.173
.

32:21.207 --> 32:22.041
- They're making their way
to the north wall.

32:23.542 --> 32:24.510
We need everyone!

32:24.543 --> 32:28.080
- Okay, let's go!

32:28.114 --> 32:29.515
- Casey!

32:29.548 --> 32:33.285
I've got something.

32:33.319 --> 32:35.554
- Hey, hey, we need a hand.

32:35.587 --> 32:36.555
Let's move this.

32:36.588 --> 32:38.190
[grunts]
Come on.

32:38.224 --> 32:39.591
- Okay, watch that second beam.

32:39.625 --> 32:42.561
That's 20 tons hanging
above your head.

32:42.594 --> 32:44.130
[all struggling]

32:44.163 --> 32:45.564
- There you go, watch it.
[grunting]

32:45.597 --> 32:46.999
Watch it.

32:47.033 --> 32:50.036
[grunting]

32:50.069 --> 32:55.241
[straining]
- Got it, got it.

32:55.274 --> 32:57.309
- Hold it up, let it drop.
- One, two, three.

32:57.343 --> 33:01.713
- Oh!
- Uh!

33:01.747 --> 33:03.649
- See anything?
- No.

33:03.682 --> 33:06.685
Can anyone hear me?
- [speaking Filipino]

33:11.357 --> 33:13.359
[speaking Filipino]

33:14.793 --> 33:17.796
- Someone's coming!
Come on.

33:17.829 --> 33:21.400
Come on.

33:21.433 --> 33:23.169
- I got it.
- We got it, we got it.

33:23.202 --> 33:24.270
- Here you go.
- Yeah, she's coming,

33:24.303 --> 33:25.571
she's coming, come on.

33:25.604 --> 33:30.809
*

33:30.842 --> 33:33.579
- Here we go, here we go.

33:33.612 --> 33:37.049
- Hey, was anyone else
down there--a woman?

33:37.083 --> 33:40.619
- She went back for Tucker.
- Great.

33:40.652 --> 33:47.659
*

33:54.333 --> 33:56.635
- Casey!

33:56.668 --> 33:59.371
Casey!

34:09.215 --> 34:11.450
- Gabby?

34:30.536 --> 34:33.139
Gabby!
- Matt!

34:33.172 --> 34:35.307
Over here!
I need your help.

34:35.341 --> 34:41.180
- Ah.

34:41.213 --> 34:43.782
This the only guy?
- Yeah.

34:52.791 --> 34:56.628
- Turn.
[grunts]

34:56.662 --> 35:00.232
Coming out!

35:00.266 --> 35:01.833
Watch your head.

35:01.867 --> 35:03.335
Grab him.
- I got him.

35:03.369 --> 35:06.238
- Good, good.
- I got him.

35:10.576 --> 35:12.611
- Ah, come on.
- It's Dawson.

35:12.644 --> 35:15.714
- Come on, quick.

35:15.747 --> 35:18.284
- Matt.
- Yeah. Hey.

35:18.317 --> 35:20.219
You're okay.
Hey.

35:20.252 --> 35:24.190
It's okay, it's okay,
it's okay.

35:24.223 --> 35:27.293
Baby.

35:27.326 --> 35:29.795
It's over.
It's over.

35:40.406 --> 35:43.742
- Feeling any pain?
Any difficulty breathing?

35:43.775 --> 35:46.712
Dizziness?
- No, no, I'm fine.

35:46.745 --> 35:48.880
I can't pay.
I'm just telling you now.

35:48.914 --> 35:53.185
You can bill me,
but blood from a stone.

35:53.219 --> 35:54.320
- You don't have to
worry about that.

35:54.353 --> 35:57.489
120 over.

35:57.523 --> 35:59.625
- What now?

35:59.658 --> 36:03.195
- You dropped this,
climbing out.

36:06.965 --> 36:09.568
I saw you holding them
down in the garage.

36:19.878 --> 36:22.414
- Thank you.

36:30.689 --> 36:33.659
- [sighs]
How's he doing?

36:33.692 --> 36:35.561
- He'll be okay.
Just needs time to work

36:35.594 --> 36:41.267
the CO out of his system.

36:41.300 --> 36:44.803
- [chuckles]
Is this real?

36:46.805 --> 36:49.341
- Pretty real.

36:49.375 --> 36:51.510
- You're a badass, Gabby Dawson.

36:51.543 --> 36:53.779
Thanks for keeping us
alive down there.

36:56.415 --> 36:58.817
- Ditto, Sergeant Tucker.

36:58.850 --> 37:01.887
You did good.
- Thanks.

37:05.657 --> 37:07.293
- Psst, Otis!

37:07.326 --> 37:08.727
I just found this
on the squad table.

37:08.760 --> 37:10.296
- Uh-oh.
- Yeah, uh-oh.

37:10.329 --> 37:12.798
So what now?
- Um--uh--

37:12.831 --> 37:15.901
You put this in your car.
We never speak of this again.

37:22.007 --> 37:23.642
- What's up?

37:23.675 --> 37:24.976
- My tie, I took it off
in the rescue,

37:25.010 --> 37:26.645
must have lost it.

37:26.678 --> 37:31.016
- Here.

37:31.049 --> 37:33.319
You're not gonna ding me
for a uniform violation,

37:33.352 --> 37:35.887
are you, Captain?
- Ehh.

37:35.921 --> 37:39.024
Maybe just a warning
this time.

37:39.057 --> 37:40.692
- Hey, congrats, man.

37:40.726 --> 37:43.562
Seriously.

37:43.595 --> 37:46.598
- Thanks, Kelly.

37:48.967 --> 37:51.803
- There are firefighters
who play the game,

37:51.837 --> 37:53.839
work the system,
bide their time

37:53.872 --> 37:56.041
to climb up the chain
of command.

37:56.074 --> 38:00.746
And then there's
Matthew Casey.

38:00.779 --> 38:05.584
A true, honest-to-God
smoke eater.

38:05.617 --> 38:07.553
The type of firefighter
who makes this department

38:07.586 --> 38:09.921
what it is.

38:09.955 --> 38:15.627
A man who truly deserves the
title he is about to receive.

38:15.661 --> 38:17.629
Matthew Casey,

38:17.663 --> 38:20.599
are you prepared to lead
as Captain

38:20.632 --> 38:23.702
with the same fearlessness,
honor, compassion

38:23.735 --> 38:27.005
that you have shown in
all your years of service?

38:27.038 --> 38:29.641
- Yes, sir, I will.

38:29.675 --> 38:34.780
- Then I believe we are ready
to make this official.

38:34.813 --> 38:37.683
Do you have it?
- I do.

38:45.524 --> 38:47.826
This badge belonged
to the first captain

38:47.859 --> 38:49.895
Firehouse 51 ever had,

38:49.928 --> 38:51.363
along with
the thousands of fires

38:51.397 --> 38:52.964
he handled in his career.

38:52.998 --> 38:57.836
He was around for the 1910
Union Stock Yards fire.

38:57.869 --> 39:01.740
21 firefighters lost their lives
in that fire.

39:01.773 --> 39:03.442
But it would've been a lot more

39:03.475 --> 39:07.746
if it weren't for the leadership
of that captain.

39:07.779 --> 39:12.083
It's a tradition I know
you'll live up to.

39:12.117 --> 39:16.488
Congratulations,
Captain Casey.

39:29.868 --> 39:33.439
- I appreciate this honor.
I do.

39:33.472 --> 39:36.642
But if anyone deserves
to be honored today, it's you,

39:36.675 --> 39:39.945
Gabby.

39:39.978 --> 39:42.147
The lives you saved.

39:42.180 --> 39:44.616
The odds you faced.

39:44.650 --> 39:48.119
You're an inspiration.

39:48.153 --> 39:50.722
I hope you know that.

39:55.494 --> 39:57.996
- Hear, hear.

39:59.531 --> 40:00.866
- Whoo!

40:00.899 --> 40:03.635
Whoo!

40:06.472 --> 40:08.774
Whoo-whoo!

40:25.991 --> 40:26.191
.

40:26.224 --> 40:29.194
[dramatic music]

40:29.227 --> 40:36.201
