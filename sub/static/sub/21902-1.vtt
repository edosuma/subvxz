01:01.520 --> 01:02.352
Do you want me
to slow down?

01:02.480 --> 01:04.563
Would you if I asked you to?

01:04.690 --> 01:07.316
Anything for you,
my darling Jadrien.

01:09.945 --> 01:11.487
( lays on horn )

01:11.614 --> 01:12.821
( tires screech )

01:14.325 --> 01:16.075
Sweet Pearl.

01:16.202 --> 01:17.785
Always looking out
for others.

01:17.912 --> 01:19.453
I can't help it.

01:19.580 --> 01:21.497
I just want to make the world
a better place.

01:22.833 --> 01:24.833
( laughs )

01:24.960 --> 01:27.169
Come on, I'm hungry.

01:46.690 --> 01:47.981
Jim's Place?

01:48.109 --> 01:50.109
Really?

01:50.236 --> 01:51.610
Again?

01:51.737 --> 01:54.571
It's not me,
it's my sweet tooth.

01:54.698 --> 01:56.031
Just one nibble and we can
go home.

02:00.412 --> 02:01.703
Do you need me
to protect you?

02:03.999 --> 02:05.874
I didn't think so.

02:07.419 --> 02:09.211
Thanks for your concern.

02:09.338 --> 02:10.545
Always, darling.

02:18.722 --> 02:19.721
Hi Brad.

02:21.725 --> 02:22.850
You know me?

02:22.977 --> 02:23.892
Name tag.

02:25.563 --> 02:27.771
Oh, right.

02:27.898 --> 02:29.898
Can I get you something?

02:30.025 --> 02:31.400
Mint chocolate chip.

02:43.998 --> 02:45.372
Anything else?

02:45.499 --> 02:46.540
You.

02:46.667 --> 02:47.541
Me?

02:47.668 --> 02:48.458
C'mon.

02:48.586 --> 02:50.169
It's no fun eating alone.

02:51.964 --> 02:53.589
Ok.

03:10.858 --> 03:11.773
Oh!

03:16.280 --> 03:19.281
You're not like other girls.

03:19.408 --> 03:22.492
You have no idea.

03:22.620 --> 03:24.369
Don't you want a bite?

03:24.496 --> 03:27.122
Well, if you're offering.

03:29.084 --> 03:31.293
( shocked gasping )

03:38.385 --> 03:38.842
Mmmm.

03:38.969 --> 03:40.636
Minty fresh.

03:42.014 --> 03:43.388
It's a shame you won't
remember this.

03:43.515 --> 03:45.390
Something tells me it was
the highlight of your night.

03:53.400 --> 03:54.149
Jadrien?

03:56.528 --> 03:59.071
Could you come back?

03:59.198 --> 04:00.989
It's too late, I had
my snack already.

04:06.372 --> 04:07.955
Hey, pretty bird.

04:08.082 --> 04:09.498
Come here.

04:09.625 --> 04:11.500
I'm not gonna hurt you.

04:11.627 --> 04:15.045
I don't eat wild animals,
just tame humans.

04:15.172 --> 04:16.421
Come here.

04:21.303 --> 04:23.136
Yeah, that's right.

04:23.264 --> 04:25.013
I'm a vampire.

04:25.140 --> 04:26.682
Is that a problem?

04:31.897 --> 04:34.064
( gasps )
No!

04:34.191 --> 04:35.774
Who's there?!

04:42.074 --> 04:45.742
What have you done?

04:45.869 --> 04:47.869
I'm fine, thanks for asking.

04:50.332 --> 04:52.124
Drink this.

04:52.251 --> 04:54.001
Is that canned blood?

04:54.128 --> 04:54.918
Dad, ew.

04:55.045 --> 04:56.128
You need it.

04:56.255 --> 04:57.629
Seriously though,
what happened?

04:57.756 --> 04:58.880
Please.

04:59.008 --> 05:01.300
Not the old amnesia
for sympathy ploy.

05:01.427 --> 05:03.051
Blood tea, Mrs. Sange.

05:04.847 --> 05:05.846
Did you come back for me?

05:05.973 --> 05:08.098
You know I'm not
the hero type.

05:08.225 --> 05:10.976
Well, then how did I get
back home?

05:11.103 --> 05:12.144
Uncle Felix found
you tucked

05:12.271 --> 05:14.146
under the eaves of
the front porch.

05:14.273 --> 05:15.856
What's the last thing you
remember?

05:15.983 --> 05:16.982
Getting staked?

05:17.109 --> 05:20.027
If you were staked
you'd be dead.

05:20.154 --> 05:21.778
So tell us what
really happened.

05:21.905 --> 05:22.904
Why would I lie?

05:23.032 --> 05:24.031
I was staked.

05:24.158 --> 05:25.991
They came up behind me
and they-

05:26.118 --> 05:28.493
They could have missed
her heart.

05:28.620 --> 05:31.079
So you were beset by
a vampire hunter,

05:31.206 --> 05:33.874
you let yourself be identified
and nearly slain.

05:34.001 --> 05:36.877
Your carelessness may have
exposed us all.

05:37.004 --> 05:38.378
You're grounded.

05:38.505 --> 05:39.629
What?!

05:39.757 --> 05:40.714
And I don't want you
hunting alone.

05:40.841 --> 05:42.507
Not until we identify
the slayer.

05:42.634 --> 05:44.134
You can hunt with Jadrien
or your cousin.

05:44.261 --> 05:45.802
I can take care of myself!

05:45.929 --> 05:49.473
Our family has many enemies.

05:49.600 --> 05:51.808
You're our only child.

05:51.935 --> 05:53.935
The crown jewel
of generations.

05:54.063 --> 05:56.063
We can't risk you.

05:56.190 --> 06:00.150
Especially not with
the ceremony coming up.

06:00.277 --> 06:01.860
What ceremony?

06:01.987 --> 06:04.446
Well, I wasn't planning on
telling you but,

06:04.573 --> 06:07.741
since we're all here...

06:07.868 --> 06:10.369
We've been chosen to host
the Fealty Ceremony.

06:10.496 --> 06:11.703
( gasps )
Where? When?

06:11.830 --> 06:13.622
I need a new dress!

06:13.749 --> 06:16.083
In the wine cellars beneath
Greenbridge Estate.

06:16.210 --> 06:17.959
In six weeks.

06:18.087 --> 06:21.254
And yes, Antoinette,
please get a new dress.

06:21.382 --> 06:24.424
And burn the one
you're wearing.

06:24.551 --> 06:28.011
The Fealty Ceremony is
the most important event

06:28.138 --> 06:30.097
in a young vampire's life.

06:30.224 --> 06:32.349
To host the ceremony
is the highest honour

06:32.476 --> 06:33.975
any family could hope for.

06:34.103 --> 06:37.312
And that, Pearl, is why we
cannot attract the attention

06:37.439 --> 06:40.649
of hunters or allow rumours
of hunters to spread.

06:40.776 --> 06:43.902
The Fealty Ceremony happens
once every hundred years.

06:48.492 --> 06:50.826
It's time to shine, Pearl.

06:58.293 --> 06:59.876
Are you sure you're ok
with this?

07:00.003 --> 07:02.587
You did almost die today.

07:02.714 --> 07:04.506
All the more reason
to train harder.

07:08.512 --> 07:11.179
( grunts )

07:13.100 --> 07:14.182
So.

07:14.309 --> 07:15.934
The Fealty Ceremony.

07:16.061 --> 07:18.353
The Sange family
just keeps rising.

07:18.480 --> 07:20.689
And you just keep tagging
along for the ride, don't you?

07:24.903 --> 07:27.362
It's so much easier than
climbing to the top by myself.

07:31.869 --> 07:33.785
And I suppose you think you're
good enough to be my escort?

07:36.039 --> 07:37.247
Of course.

07:37.374 --> 07:38.707
I'll be the judge of that.

07:42.713 --> 07:43.712
Show me what you got.

07:45.841 --> 07:48.967
( grunts )

07:49.094 --> 07:50.927
We're destined for each other,
Pearl.

07:51.054 --> 07:52.471
Your skills and connections,

07:52.598 --> 07:54.931
and my charm and
ruthless ambition.

07:55.058 --> 07:58.059
We'd be unstoppable.

07:58.187 --> 08:00.437
I already am.

08:00.564 --> 08:06.443
( grunts )

08:06.570 --> 08:08.570
Are you sure about that?

08:08.697 --> 08:13.033
Just lulling you into a false
sense of security.

08:13.160 --> 08:17.913
( grunts )

08:24.546 --> 08:26.087
Surrender.

08:32.429 --> 08:34.596
You surrender.

08:34.722 --> 08:36.181
To you?

08:36.308 --> 08:38.558
I surrender my heart
and soul.

08:38.684 --> 08:41.686
Very romantic,
considering you have neither.

08:54.535 --> 08:57.035
I cannot believe my mom
is making me do this.

08:57.162 --> 08:58.787
It builds character,
my darling.

08:58.914 --> 09:00.622
Though it'll take more than us
to get this place ready

09:00.749 --> 09:02.165
for the ceremony.

09:02.292 --> 09:03.416
Did you hear?

09:03.544 --> 09:05.460
The king's looking for
a new consort.

09:05.587 --> 09:07.879
Sounds like a thankless job.

09:08.006 --> 09:10.340
Queen of the vampires?

09:10.467 --> 09:12.926
That sounds so awesome.

09:13.053 --> 09:14.386
Hmm.

09:14.513 --> 09:16.513
My mom would have to take
orders from me.

09:16.640 --> 09:18.682
What about Jadrien?

09:18.809 --> 09:19.933
He already does.

09:20.060 --> 09:21.101
( small laugh )

09:21.228 --> 09:22.686
He's selfish and
power hungry,

09:22.813 --> 09:25.772
but he keeps me on my toes.

09:25.899 --> 09:30.068
It's like, when I'm with him I
can feel the blood in my veins.

09:30.195 --> 09:32.279
Speaking of blood,
I'm hungry.

09:32.406 --> 09:35.407
If my mom asks I'll be training
in the dojo.

09:35.534 --> 09:37.576
You just got staked yesterday.

09:37.703 --> 09:40.161
Plus, your mom said
no solo hunting.

09:40.289 --> 09:42.706
My mom says a lot of things
that I don't listen to.

09:42.833 --> 09:45.333
I'm not gonna lie for you.

09:45.460 --> 09:47.586
I'll let you borrow my black
motorcycle jacket.

09:47.713 --> 09:48.295
( sighs )

09:48.422 --> 09:49.671
Deal.

10:04.104 --> 10:05.353
Hi Brad.

10:07.357 --> 10:09.983
You- you... you know me?

10:10.110 --> 10:11.026
Name tag?

10:11.153 --> 10:12.319
( doorbell rings )

10:12.446 --> 10:14.487
You can't kill Wolverine,
he's immortal.

10:14.615 --> 10:15.989
Wrong.

10:16.116 --> 10:17.991
In Death of Wolverine, a
virus from the microverse

10:18.118 --> 10:19.576
turns off his mutant
healing factor

10:19.703 --> 10:21.453
and he suffocated by adamantium.

10:21.580 --> 10:22.245
So there.

10:22.372 --> 10:23.705
Excuse me.

10:23.832 --> 10:25.665
Uh, for pick up, right?

10:25.792 --> 10:26.791
Yeah.

10:30.547 --> 10:32.213
Can I get you something?

10:39.640 --> 10:42.265
Uh, a small mint chocolate chip.

10:42.392 --> 10:44.476
<i>Yeah, sure.</i>

10:45.354 --> 10:45.852
Is there a problem?

10:45.979 --> 10:47.228
No.

10:48.440 --> 10:49.230
<i>Did you see that?</i>

10:49.358 --> 10:50.732
<i>She had no reflection!</i>

10:53.654 --> 10:54.569
That ice cream would
taste a lot better

10:54.696 --> 10:56.529
if you shared it with me.

10:56.657 --> 10:58.114
What?

10:58.241 --> 11:00.075
You, me, out back.

11:00.202 --> 11:01.409
Now.

11:10.796 --> 11:14.005
Just making sure we're alone.

11:14.132 --> 11:15.924
You haven't seen, like,

11:16.051 --> 11:18.385
a white falcon around
here, have you?

11:18.512 --> 11:20.261
No.

11:20.389 --> 11:22.722
An albino pigeon?

11:22.849 --> 11:25.183
Any white bird?

11:25.310 --> 11:28.395
I should probably get back
to work.

11:28.522 --> 11:30.188
No.

11:30.315 --> 11:31.856
You haven't tried
my ice cream yet.

11:34.403 --> 11:36.152
Something feels off.

11:36.279 --> 11:38.905
Maybe you're lactose intolerant?

11:39.032 --> 11:40.365
( gasps )

11:41.535 --> 11:42.534
Now!

12:09.187 --> 12:11.855
Time to burn, vampire.

12:11.982 --> 12:13.398
Who's got the problem now?

12:15.235 --> 12:15.984
You do.

12:16.111 --> 12:16.985
Shoot her!

12:19.990 --> 12:21.322
<i>Dude, let's get out of here!</i>

12:26.079 --> 12:26.953
No!

12:27.080 --> 12:28.329
The sun!

12:41.511 --> 12:43.344
Dude! She's so fast!

12:47.851 --> 12:49.017
( screeching tires )

12:57.986 --> 12:59.027
I'm alive.

12:59.154 --> 12:59.861
Are you ok?

13:01.907 --> 13:02.989
<i>Are you in trouble?</i>

13:03.116 --> 13:05.074
I'm alive!

13:05.202 --> 13:06.826
Yeah, I can see that.

13:06.953 --> 13:08.620
What makes you think
that I'm in trouble?

13:08.747 --> 13:10.663
Do I look like trouble?

13:10.791 --> 13:12.957
Have you seen yourself
in a mirror recently?

13:13.084 --> 13:14.834
As a matter of fact,
I have.

13:14.961 --> 13:16.544
And I look hot.

13:16.671 --> 13:19.422
I guess, I mean, if you're in to
the whole zombie hooker look.

13:19.549 --> 13:21.591
Excuse me, that is
so offensive.

13:21.718 --> 13:24.928
I don't look like a zombie.

13:25.055 --> 13:26.137
I'm heading into town.

13:26.264 --> 13:27.680
Can I give you a lift?

13:27.808 --> 13:29.098
Sure.

13:29.226 --> 13:30.558
I could use a ride.

13:41.530 --> 13:42.695
What're you doing?

13:42.823 --> 13:44.572
Don't worry, I'll leave it
somewhere safe.

13:52.916 --> 13:54.582
What the hell just happened?

13:58.088 --> 13:59.921
( screeching tires )

14:57.772 --> 14:59.063
( sighs )

14:59.190 --> 15:00.982
Daytime driving sucks.

15:14.289 --> 15:15.496
Coffee.

15:20.003 --> 15:21.836
Cellphones.

15:25.091 --> 15:26.674
Yoga.

15:26.801 --> 15:29.385
This is what I've been
missing out on all this time?

15:29.512 --> 15:31.095
Humans are useless.

15:38.229 --> 15:39.646
Pearl, it's nearly dawn.

15:39.773 --> 15:43.232
Why aren't you in
the catacombs?

15:43.360 --> 15:44.609
I must have fallen asleep.

15:44.736 --> 15:46.194
You missed lessons.

15:46.321 --> 15:48.780
Jadrien and Antoinette said
you didn't hunt with them.

15:48.907 --> 15:50.949
Did you go hunting
by yourself again?

15:53.119 --> 15:54.786
I have to show you something.

15:59.501 --> 16:00.625
What are you doing?

16:03.296 --> 16:05.421
What's going on?

16:05.548 --> 16:07.507
Are you trying to kill yourself?

16:07.634 --> 16:10.009
I spent all day yesterday
in the light.

16:10.136 --> 16:12.553
Our vulnerability to the sun
is a myth.

16:12.681 --> 16:13.805
Please, step back.

16:13.932 --> 16:16.057
It could be a one-day miracle.

16:16.184 --> 16:16.849
My sweet rose-

16:16.977 --> 16:18.142
Step back, now!

16:26.361 --> 16:27.110
Oh my gosh!

16:27.237 --> 16:28.736
We can face the sun!

16:33.535 --> 16:35.243
( screams )

16:35.370 --> 16:36.911
( whimpers )

16:37.038 --> 16:39.872
Take her downstairs,
and speak of this to no one!

16:40.000 --> 16:40.748
No one!

16:40.875 --> 16:42.083
Everyone out!

16:42.210 --> 16:42.917
Out!

16:43.044 --> 16:44.627
<i>Get an ice bucket!</i>

16:44.754 --> 16:46.421
Except you.

16:52.262 --> 16:54.512
And one for yourself.

16:54.639 --> 16:55.555
Oh, I'm not really uh-

16:55.682 --> 16:57.098
Do it.

17:15.285 --> 17:17.535
Watch yourself, Pearl.

17:17.662 --> 17:20.079
I don't know where this new
ability of yours comes from

17:20.205 --> 17:24.584
but as long as it exists
I'm going to use it.

17:24.711 --> 17:26.127
How?

17:30.341 --> 17:32.133
We need to supply a feast
for the king

17:32.260 --> 17:33.843
at the Fealty Ceremony.

17:33.970 --> 17:36.804
Finding dozens of humans in
our current hunting grounds

17:36.931 --> 17:41.392
is problematic at best and
extremely risky at worst.

17:41.519 --> 17:43.811
So you want me to hunt
in the day?

17:43.938 --> 17:45.480
Precisely.

17:48.193 --> 17:49.817
When you attend high school.

17:49.944 --> 17:50.985
( glass shatters )

17:58.078 --> 18:01.162
( dub step music playing )

18:01.289 --> 18:02.872
This is so exciting.

18:02.999 --> 18:04.791
This is so unfair.

18:04.918 --> 18:06.667
I don't want to go
to high school.

18:06.795 --> 18:09.587
Being locked up all day with
a bunch of whiney humans?

18:09.714 --> 18:11.422
Now I really wanna
kill myself.

18:11.549 --> 18:13.841
If you die can I have Jadrien?

18:13.968 --> 18:16.010
No.

18:16.137 --> 18:18.429
It was worth a shot.

18:18.556 --> 18:20.556
Ok, so what am I wearing?

18:20.683 --> 18:23.434
I still can't believe that
you asked me to help.

18:23.561 --> 18:24.894
You never ask me to help.

18:25.021 --> 18:27.313
I'm asking you for one standard
high school outfit.

18:27.440 --> 18:29.607
And please forget your
obsession with the 80's.

18:29.734 --> 18:32.527
It depends on what clique
you want to join.

18:32.654 --> 18:34.153
You can be a nerd,

18:34.280 --> 18:35.321
a jock,

18:35.448 --> 18:36.572
a weirdo,

18:36.699 --> 18:37.698
a mean girl,

18:37.826 --> 18:39.408
or a rebel.

18:39.536 --> 18:40.743
Those are my choices?

18:40.870 --> 18:42.161
If you wanna fit in

18:42.288 --> 18:44.455
you're gonna have
to tone it down.

18:44.582 --> 18:46.666
I don't want to fit in.

18:46.793 --> 18:48.751
Do you know what humans
do all day?

18:48.878 --> 18:51.838
Drink coffee, practice yoga
and stare at their phones.

18:51.965 --> 18:52.755
That's it.

18:52.882 --> 18:55.258
This could be huge for you.

18:55.385 --> 18:58.344
When the king finds out that
you supplied the feast

18:58.471 --> 19:01.305
he's totally gonna want you
as his queen.

19:01.432 --> 19:02.807
Why would I want that?

19:02.934 --> 19:04.225
Why not?

19:04.352 --> 19:07.478
Power, baby.

19:07.605 --> 19:09.605
Hmm.

19:09.732 --> 19:12.024
Queen Pearl.

19:12.152 --> 19:14.527
I guess I like the sound
of that.

19:14.654 --> 19:17.321
I wish I was the one going
to high school.

19:17.448 --> 19:19.991
Me too.

19:20.118 --> 19:21.409
Ah.

19:23.872 --> 19:25.538
Here we go.

19:25.665 --> 19:29.876
Hoodies cross all clique lines.

19:30.003 --> 19:33.045
Are you sure you don't wanna
borrow some shoes?

19:33.173 --> 19:37.008
If I had a soul it would
look like these boots.

19:37.135 --> 19:38.134
Fine.

19:38.261 --> 19:39.385
Now listen.

19:39.512 --> 19:41.429
According to all
the teen movies

19:41.556 --> 19:44.140
the most important thing is
to be yourself.

19:44.267 --> 19:45.766
I thought the most important
thing was to fit in.

19:45.894 --> 19:47.685
By being yourself.

19:47.812 --> 19:48.978
How do I fit in with a bunch
of humans

19:49.105 --> 19:50.354
by being a vampire?

19:50.481 --> 19:52.440
You're the crown jewel.

19:52.567 --> 19:54.275
Figure it out.

20:02.535 --> 20:04.702
I was just coming
to find you.

20:04.829 --> 20:06.787
How are you feeling
about tomorrow?

20:06.915 --> 20:08.289
I'm not nervous.

20:08.416 --> 20:09.540
Definitely not nervous.

20:09.667 --> 20:11.334
Why would I be nervous?

20:11.461 --> 20:13.377
We've only got six weeks

20:13.504 --> 20:14.837
so you have to ingratiate
yourself

20:14.964 --> 20:16.631
to the community quickly.

20:16.758 --> 20:19.634
Get yourself invited into
as many homes as you can.

20:19.761 --> 20:23.221
I'm not the only source
for the king's feast, am I?

20:23.348 --> 20:25.556
You've got a back-up plan,
right?

20:25.683 --> 20:27.475
We're counting on you,
Pearl.

20:27.602 --> 20:30.102
Don't let me down.

20:30.230 --> 20:31.687
I won't.

20:31.814 --> 20:33.314
I promise.

20:37.779 --> 20:40.905
( kids chatting )

20:41.032 --> 20:42.531
Antoinette was right.

20:42.659 --> 20:47.245
Nerds, jocks, burnouts...

20:47.372 --> 20:48.079
Pearl!

20:48.206 --> 20:49.247
How do you know my name?

20:49.374 --> 20:50.706
I'm- I'm on the welcome
committee.

20:50.833 --> 20:53.376
I'm Bethany, your student guide.

20:53.503 --> 20:56.337
Your file didn't have a photo
but I just knew it was you.

20:56.464 --> 20:58.714
I mean, we don't really get
that many new kids around here.

20:58.841 --> 20:59.757
Hey Bethany.

20:59.884 --> 21:01.259
Hey.

21:01.386 --> 21:03.678
What're you doing here?

21:03.805 --> 21:04.595
I go here now.

21:04.722 --> 21:06.597
Do you guys know each other?

21:06.724 --> 21:08.391
She's the one who stole
my car.

21:08.518 --> 21:10.017
I returned it.

21:10.144 --> 21:12.603
Parking it in a tow zone.

21:12.730 --> 21:14.522
Which I'm sure was not
on purpose.

21:14.649 --> 21:17.900
I mean, everyone deserves
a second chance, right Evan?

21:18.027 --> 21:19.610
He's not a morning person.

21:19.737 --> 21:20.778
That makes two of us.

21:20.905 --> 21:22.029
Just wait, you're gonna love
it here.

21:22.156 --> 21:25.074
Everyone is super nice
and super awesome.

21:25.201 --> 21:26.575
You parked in my spot.

21:26.703 --> 21:27.827
Sorry, Ashlyn.

21:27.954 --> 21:29.328
You don't own
the parking lot.

21:29.455 --> 21:32.415
Hey Evan, when you want
a lift out of Loserville

21:32.542 --> 21:34.000
let me know.

21:34.127 --> 21:35.918
Are you the queen bee
or the mean girl?

21:36.045 --> 21:39.463
I forgot the difference.

21:39.590 --> 21:41.424
Don't mess with me,
new girl.

21:41.551 --> 21:43.718
I'm all sting and no honey.

21:43.845 --> 21:45.011
Nice boots.

21:45.138 --> 21:46.304
Freak.

21:48.683 --> 21:50.141
She blocked me in.

21:57.025 --> 21:58.733
( glass shatters )

21:59.694 --> 22:08.242
( car alarm wails )

22:13.833 --> 22:15.416
Uh, thank you?

22:17.587 --> 22:19.253
Here's your class schedule

22:19.380 --> 22:20.963
and a list of clubs and teams
you can join,

22:21.090 --> 22:23.716
and a map of the school.

22:23.843 --> 22:26.719
You're supposed to have
a student guide.

22:26.846 --> 22:28.804
Oh, there you are.

22:28.931 --> 22:31.432
I thought I lost you.

22:31.559 --> 22:33.976
You're, like, really fast.

22:34.103 --> 22:35.895
Clearly not fast enough.

22:36.022 --> 22:38.064
It says here you've been
home schooled your whole life.

22:38.191 --> 22:40.775
Your mother must be
some kind of angel.

22:40.902 --> 22:42.693
Angel of darkness.

22:42.820 --> 22:45.363
If you have any questions or
if anyone's bothering you

22:45.490 --> 22:46.989
just let me know.

22:47.116 --> 22:48.407
Don't worry about Pearl,

22:48.534 --> 22:50.826
I'm gonna take good care
of her.

22:50.953 --> 22:52.620
She's bothering me.

22:56.209 --> 22:58.376
Welcome to contemporary
art lab.

22:58.503 --> 23:00.628
Would you like to introduce
yourself?

23:00.755 --> 23:03.047
No.

23:03.174 --> 23:04.757
Final projects are due
in two months.

23:04.884 --> 23:06.342
You'll have to catch up
on your own.

23:06.469 --> 23:08.969
She can borrow my notes.

23:09.097 --> 23:09.970
You want to sit?

23:10.098 --> 23:11.222
Lovely.

23:11.349 --> 23:13.391
Then I can grade two
art projects

23:13.518 --> 23:16.352
full of sunshine and daisies.

23:16.479 --> 23:17.895
Oh, I won't need her notes.

23:20.066 --> 23:21.440
From the looks of you
I'm guessing

23:21.567 --> 23:23.943
you wouldn't have taught
anything I don't already know.

23:24.070 --> 23:25.820
Excuse me?

23:25.947 --> 23:28.906
You've got a framed picture
of Andy Warhol on your desk

23:29.033 --> 23:33.744
next to, oh my gosh,
an apple.

23:33.871 --> 23:34.829
You're just a grumpy
art teacher

23:34.956 --> 23:36.288
who's still bitter about
his painting

23:36.416 --> 23:38.624
that didn't win a blue ribbon
at the county fair.

23:38.751 --> 23:41.335
I'm sure your artistic teachings
are equally original.

23:45.425 --> 23:46.424
That was fast.

23:49.595 --> 23:53.556
Question: how many days
'til graduation?

23:53.683 --> 23:55.599

I thought they were friends?

26:17.535 --> 26:19.535
Oh yeah, they are
best friends.

26:19.662 --> 26:21.036
They also hate each other.

26:21.163 --> 26:22.913
That makes no sense.

26:23.040 --> 26:24.081
Yeah, well, keep
your friends close

26:24.208 --> 26:27.960
and your enemies closer,
I guess.

26:28.087 --> 26:29.086
Not that you have to worry
about enemies.

26:29.213 --> 26:32.506
I mean, you're like a unicorn.

26:32.633 --> 26:33.465
A unicorn?

26:33.593 --> 26:34.842
Yeah.

26:34.969 --> 26:36.135
You just compared me
to a defective horse

26:36.262 --> 26:38.178
who sweats glitter
and poops rainbows?

26:38.306 --> 26:40.264
No, I just mean you're like,
um... you're like,

26:40.391 --> 26:42.474
a unique and rare creature,
you know?

26:42.602 --> 26:45.227
I mean, does anything
even scare you?

26:45.354 --> 26:48.439
( falcon screeching )

26:48.566 --> 26:49.690
No.

26:52.695 --> 26:54.987
You can't cut gym on your
first day!

26:55.114 --> 26:56.614
Ok.

26:58.826 --> 27:02.411
Come here, birdie.

27:02.538 --> 27:05.748
Where are you?

27:05.875 --> 27:07.708
Where are you, birdie?

27:10.421 --> 27:12.129
I'm not gonna hurt you.

27:13.257 --> 27:14.048
Much.

28:10.856 --> 28:12.523
Pearl?

28:12.650 --> 28:14.233
Ow!

28:14.360 --> 28:15.693
Evan.

28:15.820 --> 28:17.027
What are you doing here?

28:17.154 --> 28:18.112
What am I doing here?

28:18.239 --> 28:19.571
This is my house.

28:19.699 --> 28:21.115
What are you doing sleeping
on my dock?

28:21.242 --> 28:22.783
I was sleeping?

28:22.910 --> 28:23.909
In broad daylight?

28:24.036 --> 28:25.160
Yeah.

28:25.287 --> 28:26.787
What is happening to me?

28:26.914 --> 28:29.456
I'm guessing you either have
to lower or up your dosage.

28:29.583 --> 28:31.625
Hey, I am not on drugs.

28:31.752 --> 28:34.628
So far you've stolen my car,
vandalized another one,

28:34.755 --> 28:37.047
ditched school, and
now you're trespassing.

28:37.174 --> 28:40.384
Forgive me if I don't trust you.

28:40.511 --> 28:42.636
I never asked for your trust.

28:42.763 --> 28:44.722
What're you running from?

28:44.849 --> 28:47.683
I'm not running
from anything.

28:47.810 --> 28:50.769
Maybe I'm chasing something.

28:50.896 --> 28:52.771
Ok.

28:52.898 --> 28:54.148
I hope I'm not giving you
the wrong impression.

28:54.275 --> 28:56.692
I'm not hitting on you.

28:56.819 --> 28:58.444
Why not?

28:58.571 --> 29:00.821
No offense, you're
not really my type.

29:03.367 --> 29:04.825
Well, that's too bad.

29:04.952 --> 29:06.660
You have a nice ass.

29:09.290 --> 29:11.331
( horn honks )

29:11.459 --> 29:12.666
What the hell?

29:12.793 --> 29:14.334
It's my parents.

29:14.462 --> 29:15.669
I'm not supposed to have people
over when they're not home.

29:22.887 --> 29:24.052
( inaudible chatter )

29:24.180 --> 29:26.263
They don't look that scary.

29:26.390 --> 29:27.973
They've adopted six kids
from foster care

29:28.100 --> 29:30.267
and raised us all on
social worker's hours.

29:30.394 --> 29:33.103
Those are some steel-toed
Birkenstocks on their feet.

29:33.230 --> 29:34.688
Those are your siblings?

29:34.815 --> 29:36.440
Half of them.

29:36.567 --> 29:38.525
They look interesting.

29:38.652 --> 29:39.777
I should introduce myself.

29:39.904 --> 29:41.320
No!

29:41.447 --> 29:42.654
<i>Evan!</i>

29:42.782 --> 29:44.573
You home?

29:44.700 --> 29:45.699
You should go.

29:45.826 --> 29:47.117
Nah, I think I'll stay.

29:47.244 --> 29:48.869
Pearl, I'm not kidding.

29:48.996 --> 29:49.870
<i>Evan!</i>

29:49.997 --> 29:51.872
Where are you?

29:51.999 --> 29:53.207
<i>Come on, Evan.</i>

29:53.334 --> 29:55.209
<i>This car's not gonna</i>
<i>unload itself.</i>

29:55.336 --> 29:57.211
I'll be right there.

30:08.349 --> 30:10.224
Your first course.

30:10.351 --> 30:13.352
Ashlyn's parents will be
expecting you.

30:13.479 --> 30:15.729
And a cheque to cover
some minor car damage.

30:18.859 --> 30:20.609
That's it?

30:20.736 --> 30:24.530
You're not gonna ask me how
my first day of school was?

30:24.657 --> 30:27.658
I have a ceremony to plan
for over 100 vampires

30:27.785 --> 30:29.243
including the king.

30:29.370 --> 30:31.578
I don't have time
for your ramblings.

30:31.705 --> 30:33.539
Or your attitude.

30:33.666 --> 30:34.414
I wasn't-

30:34.542 --> 30:35.666
You have one job.

30:35.793 --> 30:37.000
Get us invited into
human homes

30:37.127 --> 30:39.253
so we can feast from them
and feed the king.

30:39.380 --> 30:41.755
Do you understand?

30:41.882 --> 30:43.465
Yes, mother...

30:43.592 --> 30:44.424
<i>Whatever.</i>

30:47.263 --> 30:49.513
I'm not your father!

30:49.640 --> 30:51.932
Unless it benefits the family

30:52.059 --> 30:56.436
I don't care about what you
think or how your day was.

31:04.488 --> 31:06.113
Yes!

31:18.878 --> 31:20.002
Boo!

31:20.129 --> 31:21.169
What the hell?

31:21.297 --> 31:22.588
I saw you sneak in here.

31:22.715 --> 31:24.423
I thought you might be cheating
on me.

31:24.550 --> 31:25.799
Really?

31:25.926 --> 31:26.717
Of course not.

31:26.844 --> 31:27.676
Why would anyone cheat on me?

31:27.803 --> 31:28.969
I'm gorgeous.

31:29.096 --> 31:30.929
I didn't get to feed all day
at school.

31:31.056 --> 31:32.264
I didn't think I could
make it through

31:32.391 --> 31:36.143
Minerva's etiquette class
on an empty stomach.

31:36.270 --> 31:37.811
I missed you.

31:37.938 --> 31:39.813
Maybe you can take me out
for some ice cream later?

31:43.736 --> 31:44.985
Hmm.

31:45.112 --> 31:46.695
You might wanna shower
before class, darling.

31:46.822 --> 31:48.155
You reek of humans.

31:51.327 --> 31:57.122
At the Fealty Ceremony you
will be presented to the king,

31:57.249 --> 31:59.499
and after he has drunk
from each of you

31:59.627 --> 32:02.836
he will fill a goblet
with his blood,

32:02.963 --> 32:05.714
and once you and the other
vampires at the feast

32:05.841 --> 32:08.467
have drunk from that goblet

32:08.594 --> 32:16.475
you will be bound to him
and he to you.

32:16.602 --> 32:23.106
The king is a cruel
and sadistic ruler.

32:23.233 --> 32:28.779
He does not tolerate mistakes
or tardiness!

32:31.533 --> 32:33.200
I- I apologize for my tardiness.

32:35.329 --> 32:37.287
What do you think?

32:37.414 --> 32:40.874
Does Pearl deserve
a second chance?

32:41.001 --> 32:42.584
<i>( All ): No.</i>

32:42.711 --> 32:45.337
That's what I thought.

32:45.464 --> 32:46.713
Kneel.

32:57.393 --> 32:59.393
( whipping )

33:07.236 --> 33:10.112
( student chatter )

33:10.239 --> 33:11.321
Back off, people.

33:11.448 --> 33:13.407
Give the lady some space.

33:13.534 --> 33:14.950
What's going on?

33:15.077 --> 33:17.494
Seems like the new girl
has made quite an impression.

33:17.621 --> 33:19.913
What's up, Bethany?

33:20.040 --> 33:22.040
You smell pretty.

33:22.167 --> 33:24.167
I noticed you didn't have
a notebook and...

33:24.294 --> 33:25.335
and I just wanted to say
thank you

33:25.462 --> 33:27.129
for standing up for me
with Ashlyn.

33:27.256 --> 33:29.006
And Mr. Beairsto.

33:29.133 --> 33:30.590
Yeah, well, I didn't do it
for you.

33:30.718 --> 33:32.134
Oh, yes you did.

33:32.261 --> 33:35.303
You act all tough but I know
you have a good heart.

33:35.431 --> 33:37.264
( laughs )

33:37.391 --> 33:38.598
What's so funny?

33:38.726 --> 33:40.934
Bethany just said that I have
a good heart.

33:41.061 --> 33:42.102
That's funny.

33:42.229 --> 33:43.061
You're funny.

33:43.188 --> 33:43.937
I might just have to keep you.

33:44.064 --> 33:45.647
What about me? I'm funny.

33:45.774 --> 33:47.232
Yeah, funny looking.

33:47.359 --> 33:49.109
Dude, I'm unconventionally
handsome.

33:49.236 --> 33:51.528
Which is just a nice way of
saying conventionally ugly.

33:51.655 --> 33:53.405
Ok, I'll keep all of you.

33:53.532 --> 33:54.322
Ok.

33:54.450 --> 33:55.991
Even you, Evan.

33:56.118 --> 33:58.535
All I ask is that you invite me
over for dinner sometime.

33:58.662 --> 34:00.245
My parents don't like to cook.

34:00.372 --> 34:01.496
Sure.

34:02.249 --> 34:03.123
( school bell )

34:03.250 --> 34:04.041
Uh, ok.

34:04.168 --> 34:06.626
Well, we better get to gym.

34:06.754 --> 34:08.003
You're not that funny.

34:18.139 --> 34:20.098
I see you met my parents.

34:20.225 --> 34:22.100
What?

34:22.226 --> 34:23.476
My parents?

34:23.603 --> 34:26.353
They came by with
a cheque yesterday?

34:26.482 --> 34:28.023
Oh, right.

34:32.780 --> 34:36.281
I'm sorry.

34:36.408 --> 34:37.991
For what?

34:38.118 --> 34:40.118
For... nothing.

34:40.245 --> 34:43.038
I... I have nothing
to be sorry about.

34:43.165 --> 34:44.790
I need to go to the nurse.

34:49.004 --> 34:50.378
Oh, poor thing.

34:50.505 --> 34:53.672
You know, she was puking
in the bathroom all morning.

34:53.801 --> 34:56.510
If it's an eating disorder
it's not working.

34:56.637 --> 34:59.304
I mean, those shorts
are looking a little tight.

34:59.431 --> 35:02.432
( giggles )

35:02.559 --> 35:04.976
Well, that was fast.

35:05.104 --> 35:05.894
Yeah.

35:06.021 --> 35:07.646
Kill or be killed.

35:07.773 --> 35:10.565
Was it not like that
at your old school?

35:10.692 --> 35:13.235
I was home schooled.

35:13.362 --> 35:14.653
How's high school?

35:14.780 --> 35:15.862
Fine.

35:16.615 --> 35:18.365
( grunts )

35:37.094 --> 35:39.594
I loved your presentation on
the graffiti artist, Banksy.

35:39.721 --> 35:40.887
Never doubt your art.

35:41.014 --> 35:42.597
Oh, well that didn't work out
so well for him.

35:48.480 --> 35:50.897
I'm having a sleepover
next Saturday.

35:51.024 --> 35:52.899
You should come.

35:53.026 --> 35:54.901
To your house?

35:55.028 --> 35:56.444
I'd love to.

36:12.838 --> 36:15.547
<i>The night of the Fealty</i>
<i>is drawing near.</i>

36:15.674 --> 36:18.800
The ceremony is in two weeks.

36:18.927 --> 36:20.802
Two weeks!

36:20.929 --> 36:26.391
Before you know it you will
be kneeling before the king.

36:26.518 --> 36:30.145
Try not to disgrace
yourself in the meantime.

36:32.232 --> 36:34.816
You coming to the party?

36:34.943 --> 36:35.859
No, I'm too tired.

36:35.986 --> 36:38.528
Come on, come and play
with us.

36:38.655 --> 36:41.031
I never get to see you anymore.

36:41.158 --> 36:44.201
I know, I've just been so busy.

36:44.328 --> 36:46.328
Supplying the king's feast
is a lot harder than I thought.

36:46.455 --> 36:48.038
Be careful, Pearl.

36:48.165 --> 36:51.124
You're starting to sound like
those whiny humans you hate.

36:51.251 --> 36:52.375
You guys coming?

36:52.502 --> 36:54.002
Have fun at school.

37:21.448 --> 37:23.823
Hello my sweet rose.

37:23.951 --> 37:25.075
Hey, dad.

37:25.202 --> 37:26.701
I've been so busy
with the ceremony

37:26.828 --> 37:29.412
I haven't had time to ask you
about how school is going.

37:29.539 --> 37:31.581
Tell me about your experiences.

37:31.708 --> 37:34.876
No vampire has seen
what you've seen.

37:35.003 --> 37:36.920
They like to talk.

37:37.047 --> 37:40.340
Their loyalty seems to shift
a bit but...

37:40.467 --> 37:42.050
they're funnier than
I thought they'd be.

37:42.177 --> 37:43.718
They're the enemy, Pearl.

37:43.845 --> 37:46.179
Never forget that.

37:46.306 --> 37:48.056
I haven't.

37:48.183 --> 37:49.808
I know who and what I am.

37:49.935 --> 37:50.725
Good.

37:50.852 --> 37:53.270
Keep hold of that.

37:53.397 --> 37:57.399
You haven't reported
in recently.

37:57.526 --> 37:59.234
Not much to report.

37:59.361 --> 38:03.697
I've been laying the groundwork,
gaining trust.

38:03.824 --> 38:05.699
This is a complex hunt.

38:05.826 --> 38:07.284
I hate to pressure you,
sweetheart.

38:07.411 --> 38:09.703
Your performance...

38:09.830 --> 38:12.497
you've only gotten us access
to one family so far.

38:12.624 --> 38:14.374
That's not going to be enough
for the feast.

38:14.501 --> 38:16.918
We need more addresses.

38:17.045 --> 38:20.755
I- I know, it's just-
it's harder than I thought.

38:20.882 --> 38:24.551
Finding the right victims.

38:24.678 --> 38:26.428
Uncle Felix tells me
you've been raiding

38:26.555 --> 38:28.013
the stored blood.

38:28.140 --> 38:30.265
You're not even
feeding yourself.

38:30.392 --> 38:33.226
You must do better.

38:33.353 --> 38:34.936
The king.

38:35.063 --> 38:37.230
What happened to you?

38:37.357 --> 38:41.359
If he sees the benefits
he will accept you.

38:41.486 --> 38:46.573
Perhaps even choose you
for his queen.

38:46.700 --> 38:50.660
And if he doesn't see
the benefit?

38:50.787 --> 38:53.538
You've heard the stories,
I'm sure.

38:53.665 --> 38:57.292
Not even I can protect you
from his wrath.

38:57.419 --> 38:59.252
Speaking of protection,

38:59.379 --> 39:02.881
have we found out anything
about this slayer?

39:03.008 --> 39:05.550
It's possible it wasn't
a slayer.

39:05.677 --> 39:08.386
We think it might have been
another vampire.

39:08.513 --> 39:09.721
What?

39:09.848 --> 39:12.432
Humans are not the only ones
who fear us.

39:12.559 --> 39:14.434
Our family is powerful

39:14.561 --> 39:17.771
and many vampires would love
to take us down.

39:17.898 --> 39:20.148
You must stay strong.

39:20.275 --> 39:22.650
We need you now
more than ever.

39:31.036 --> 39:32.619
Have you ever considered yoga?

39:32.746 --> 39:33.912
I hear it's good for
anger management.

39:34.039 --> 39:35.747
You have no idea what
I'm going through.

39:35.874 --> 39:37.916
With my parents, the pressure
that I'm under?

39:38.043 --> 39:38.833
My boyfriend?

39:38.960 --> 39:39.876
You have a boyfriend?

39:40.003 --> 39:41.503
You don't know anything
about me!

39:47.135 --> 39:49.094
Everything was fine before...

39:49.221 --> 39:51.304
Before what?

39:51.431 --> 39:53.139
I don't belong here.

39:53.266 --> 39:54.974
Wait, Pearl...

39:55.102 --> 39:56.601
Don't touch me.

40:10.283 --> 40:12.200
I swear, I'm gonna bite
the next person that I see.

40:14.287 --> 40:15.703
Pearl, hey.

40:23.255 --> 40:25.422
Are you ok?

40:25.549 --> 40:26.673
Why are you looking at me
like that?

40:26.800 --> 40:28.383
I need to talk to you.

40:28.510 --> 40:30.385
Yeah, ok.

40:30.512 --> 40:31.636
Come here.

40:33.682 --> 40:35.056
Pearl? Where are we going?

40:35.183 --> 40:36.724
It's getting dark.

40:45.277 --> 40:45.900
Why are you taking me here?

40:46.027 --> 40:48.278
It's dark and creepy.

40:48.405 --> 40:50.029
Is this about Evan?

40:50.157 --> 40:51.573
What?

40:51.700 --> 40:54.284
Because you know that we're
just friends, right?

40:54.411 --> 40:56.161
Actually, more than friends.

40:56.288 --> 40:58.037
No, he's like a brother to me,
still.

40:58.165 --> 40:59.038
No, just friends.

40:59.166 --> 41:00.457
No benefits.

41:00.584 --> 41:02.083
Except the AP History is
a definite plus-

41:02.210 --> 41:03.835
Just stop talking.

41:03.962 --> 41:04.544
Stop.

41:04.671 --> 41:05.503
Close your mouth.

41:08.133 --> 41:09.257
Pearl...

41:16.892 --> 41:20.518
I- I'm not gonna kiss you!

41:20.645 --> 41:22.145
I'm not gay.

41:22.272 --> 41:23.563
Well, neither am I.

41:23.690 --> 41:25.523
But I mean, you were holding
my face

41:25.650 --> 41:27.025
and all the girls are doing it,

41:27.152 --> 41:28.109
and... I mean...

41:28.236 --> 41:29.110
( laughs )

41:29.237 --> 41:31.738
You were holding my face!

41:31.865 --> 41:33.406
( laughing )
I was.

41:33.533 --> 41:34.282
That's weird.

41:34.409 --> 41:35.241
I guess I'm a weirdo.

41:35.368 --> 41:40.538
Yeah, you are.

41:40.665 --> 41:41.873
It must be nice.

41:42.000 --> 41:44.459
What?

41:44.586 --> 41:46.002
Being you.

41:46.129 --> 41:49.422
Living a normal, happy life.

41:49.549 --> 41:51.758
My life isn't normal.

41:51.885 --> 41:53.676
Or happy.

41:53.803 --> 41:55.345
Little Miss Sunshine?

41:55.472 --> 41:58.973
What deep, dark secrets
are you hiding?

41:59.100 --> 42:01.768
It's not something I really like
to talk about.

42:08.443 --> 42:09.567
When I was in preschool

42:09.694 --> 42:12.612
my parents used to forget
to pick me up.

42:12.739 --> 42:15.698
They were always forgetting
about me.

42:15.825 --> 42:19.118
Anyway, one day
this man shows up

42:19.246 --> 42:21.538
and says that they had sent
him to get me.

42:21.665 --> 42:22.997
And I recognized him.

42:23.124 --> 42:29.837
I had seen him around the house,
so I went with him.

42:29.965 --> 42:34.634
He called me his sweet rose.

42:34.761 --> 42:44.477
We walked home through the woods
and, well, he hurt me,

42:44.604 --> 42:47.814
and one of the preschool moms,
Evan's mom actually,

42:47.941 --> 42:54.612
happened to be walking by
and rescued me.

42:54.739 --> 42:56.948
That's why Evan and I
are so close.

42:57.075 --> 43:00.618
His parents practically
raised me.

43:00.745 --> 43:03.621
I'm so sorry.

43:03.748 --> 43:06.249
You're not the one that hurt me.

43:06.376 --> 43:08.167
You don't have anything
to be sorry for.

43:12.924 --> 43:15.341
Thanks for picking us up,
Evan.

43:17.929 --> 43:18.886
Pearl, wait!

43:21.349 --> 43:24.267
Aren't you going to introduce
me to your little friend, Pearl?

43:24.394 --> 43:25.935
What're you doing here?

43:26.062 --> 43:27.729
Well, you said you
missed me,

43:27.856 --> 43:31.190
so I thought it would be nice if
we could get dinner together.

43:31.318 --> 43:35.862
A bit plain for my taste but
if this is what's on the menu...

43:35.989 --> 43:37.947
Hey, what's going on?

43:38.074 --> 43:39.198
You're gonna ruin everything!

43:39.326 --> 43:40.908
Not everything.

43:41.036 --> 43:42.243
Just this thing.

43:42.370 --> 43:43.786
I am not a thing.

43:43.913 --> 43:45.872
You must be Pearl's boyfriend.

43:45.999 --> 43:46.914
And you are...?

43:47.042 --> 43:47.999
Not afraid of you.

43:48.126 --> 43:50.001
That's funny.

43:50.128 --> 43:51.085
Very funny.

43:52.714 --> 43:55.590
( groans )

43:57.594 --> 43:58.468
She can handle him.

43:58.595 --> 43:59.761
We can't just leave her.

43:59.888 --> 44:01.054
Let's go.

44:01.181 --> 44:03.014
What's happening, Pearl?

44:03.141 --> 44:05.308
Nothing's happening, I'm
just on a complicated hunt

44:05.435 --> 44:06.768
which you just totally
jeopardized!

44:06.895 --> 44:08.436
Bull....!

44:08.563 --> 44:09.437
I've seen you hunt.

44:09.564 --> 44:10.313
You're relentless.

44:10.440 --> 44:11.564
You're spontaneous.

44:11.691 --> 44:12.440
You're...

44:14.235 --> 44:15.735
you're unstoppable.

44:17.072 --> 44:20.448
Now you're... I miss you,
Pearl.

44:20.575 --> 44:23.785
You haven't been the same
since the night at Jim's Place.

44:23.912 --> 44:25.745
Yes I am.

44:25.872 --> 44:27.997
Prove it.

44:28.124 --> 44:29.999
Prove to me that
you're still you.

44:30.126 --> 44:33.878
That we're still us. Please.

44:34.005 --> 44:35.546
Please, Pearl.

44:41.262 --> 44:42.887
Just like old times.

44:50.730 --> 44:52.605
Hey, Brad.

44:52.732 --> 44:54.065
Do you know me?

44:54.192 --> 44:55.817
Name tag.

44:55.944 --> 45:01.781
I mean, I remember your name tag
from the last time I was here.

45:01.908 --> 45:03.616
I remember you now.

45:03.743 --> 45:05.660
Those guys, they came in
and they were-

45:05.787 --> 45:07.328
Nothing I couldn't handle.

45:10.166 --> 45:11.958
You look different.

45:12.085 --> 45:16.129
Before you were hot.

45:16.256 --> 45:20.800
Now you're beautiful.

45:20.927 --> 45:23.761
Thanks.

45:23.888 --> 45:27.223
Uh, I bet you say that
to all the girls.

45:27.350 --> 45:31.185
Girls don't usually pay
attention to me.

45:31.312 --> 45:33.146
You're a really nice guy.

45:33.273 --> 45:36.065
Some lucky girl is gonna
figure that out.

45:36.192 --> 45:38.776
Are you some sort of angel?

45:38.903 --> 45:42.822
( sharp whistle )

45:42.949 --> 45:44.365
Actually, no.

45:44.492 --> 45:46.868
I'm the complete opposite.

45:46.995 --> 45:49.162
Shut up and stay still.

45:49.289 --> 45:51.122
Don't look at me.

45:53.418 --> 45:54.292
Damn you!

45:56.171 --> 45:57.044
What're you doing?

45:57.172 --> 45:57.920
Bite him!

45:58.047 --> 45:58.713
No!

45:58.840 --> 45:59.338
What do you mean, no?

45:59.466 --> 46:00.256
You're vampires?

46:00.383 --> 46:01.716
Stop telling me what to do!

46:01.843 --> 46:02.925
I don't owe you anything!

46:03.052 --> 46:04.677
Or my parents, or the king.

46:04.804 --> 46:06.721
The- the king?

46:06.848 --> 46:09.182
Is- is Elvis a vampire, too?

46:09.309 --> 46:10.308
Shut up, Brad.

46:10.435 --> 46:11.434
I'm trying to save
your life here.

46:11.561 --> 46:13.144
Did you hear what
you just said?

46:13.271 --> 46:17.857
You're trying to save the life
of a human?

46:17.984 --> 46:19.108
You're obviously sick.

46:19.235 --> 46:20.359
I'm taking you home.

46:20.487 --> 46:22.069
You don't get it!

46:22.197 --> 46:23.362
Just because
they don't remember

46:23.490 --> 46:25.364
it doesn't mean
they don't feel it.

46:25.492 --> 46:27.074
Our bites ruin the-

46:27.202 --> 46:28.576
Who cares?!

46:28.703 --> 46:32.038
I want to ruin them
because we are vampires

46:32.165 --> 46:35.374
and that is what we do!

46:35.502 --> 46:37.919
( moans )

46:49.557 --> 46:50.765
Bite him.

46:55.355 --> 46:56.938
Bleed him dry.

47:26.928 --> 47:28.386
It's not my blood.

47:32.684 --> 47:33.599
Come in.

47:34.769 --> 47:35.810
Did he hurt you?

47:38.565 --> 47:43.401
I made a mistake.

47:43.528 --> 47:44.861
I... I couldn't stop myself.

47:44.988 --> 47:46.237
I...

47:49.325 --> 47:50.950
this was the only place
I could think of

47:51.077 --> 47:53.786
that made me feel safe.

47:53.913 --> 47:55.454
Can I stay here?

47:55.582 --> 47:57.331
Just for tonight?

47:57.458 --> 47:58.791
Of course.

48:04.716 --> 48:05.631
Here.

48:11.639 --> 48:14.223
You left me with Jadrien

48:14.350 --> 48:16.601
even though you knew
he was dangerous.

48:16.728 --> 48:18.603
Well, you said you were ok.

48:18.730 --> 48:21.355
I trust you.

48:21.482 --> 48:25.026
Yeah, well, you probably
shouldn't, but thank you.

48:35.079 --> 48:37.997
So prom.

48:38.124 --> 48:40.458
Is it everything the movies
make it out to be?

48:40.585 --> 48:43.002
300 hot-blooded students
in heels and tuxes,

48:43.129 --> 48:46.172
trapped in a room together,
slow dancing to Justin Bieber?

48:46.299 --> 48:48.382
Yeah, it's super fun.

48:48.509 --> 48:50.927
( laughs )

48:51.054 --> 48:53.804
You should come.
With me.

48:59.854 --> 49:02.104
Are you asking me to prom?

49:02.231 --> 49:07.318
I look really good in a tux.

49:07.445 --> 49:11.572
I'm afraid I have other plans
that evening.

49:11.699 --> 49:13.491
A family thing.

49:18.873 --> 49:22.750
Something's wrong with me.

49:22.877 --> 49:24.210
I don't know what
to do anymore.

49:24.337 --> 49:27.213
I feel so lost.

49:27.340 --> 49:31.801
Sometimes you have to lose
your way to find yourself.

49:31.928 --> 49:33.678
Did you read that in
a fortune cookie?

49:33.805 --> 49:35.262
Bumper sticker.

49:40.061 --> 49:42.520
What if there is
no right choice?

49:45.274 --> 49:46.941
Then make the left one.

50:18.141 --> 50:19.807
We're counting on you.

50:23.813 --> 50:26.897
A vampire with a conscience.

50:27.025 --> 50:29.150
So not what I wanted to be
when I grew up.

50:41.414 --> 50:43.873
300 hot-blooded students
in heels and tuxes,

50:44.000 --> 50:47.960
trapped in a room together,
slow dancing to Justin Bieber.

50:48.087 --> 50:49.628
What is this?

50:49.756 --> 50:51.464
It's my apology.

50:51.591 --> 50:53.299
You protected a human.

50:53.426 --> 50:55.134
Three humans.

50:55.261 --> 50:58.471
You bit Jadrien.

50:58.598 --> 51:01.182
And you nearly emptied
the stored blood supply.

51:01.309 --> 51:04.435
And you got human stink
all over my favourite sweater.

51:04.562 --> 51:06.437
The feast is in less
than two weeks

51:06.564 --> 51:07.480
and you've brought us nothing.

51:07.607 --> 51:09.648
I didn't ask for this!

51:09.776 --> 51:12.193
You were the ones who made me
go to school.

51:12.320 --> 51:13.611
I should be living it up,

51:13.738 --> 51:15.488
enjoying the last few days
of my vampire childhood,

51:15.615 --> 51:18.032
not worrying about how I'm
gonna single-handedly feed

51:18.159 --> 51:21.285
the whole vampire kingdom.

51:21.412 --> 51:23.454
You're right.

51:23.581 --> 51:26.624
Maybe it was too much to ask.

51:26.751 --> 51:30.836
But your behaviour
is unacceptable.

51:30.963 --> 51:32.546
You're right.

51:32.673 --> 51:35.966
I'm sorry.

51:36.094 --> 51:40.012
300 students equals 300 pints.

51:40.139 --> 51:42.139
Let the school borrow the estate
above the wine cellar

51:42.266 --> 51:46.268
for the dance and lock
the doors.

51:46.395 --> 51:48.896
Maybe we can take a pint
from everyone.

51:49.023 --> 51:51.148
That way no one gets sick.

51:51.275 --> 51:52.483
No one will remember
a thing.

51:57.865 --> 51:59.073
It's done.

52:08.251 --> 52:09.583
What happened
to you last night?

52:09.710 --> 52:11.210
Are you ok?

52:11.337 --> 52:12.711
When you weren't there
this morning I called her.

52:12.839 --> 52:14.880
I thought maybe you had gone
to her house or something.

52:15.007 --> 52:18.592
Well, thank you both for
your concern, but I'm fine.

52:18.719 --> 52:20.052
I went home.

52:20.179 --> 52:21.762
I made the left choice.

52:21.889 --> 52:23.472
All fixed.

52:23.599 --> 52:24.765
It's not all fixed.

52:24.892 --> 52:26.183
All fixed.

52:26.310 --> 52:28.853
Ok, why are you hanging up
prom flyers?

52:28.980 --> 52:30.729
Because I joined
the prom committee.

52:30.857 --> 52:32.273
I thought you were busy
that night.

52:32.400 --> 52:33.691
Change of plans.

52:33.818 --> 52:35.025
We're going.

52:35.153 --> 52:36.861
How do you know I don't already
have a date?

52:36.988 --> 52:38.279
I don't.

52:38.406 --> 52:39.572
Pick me up at 8:00.

52:39.699 --> 52:41.323
Woah, nice work on prom.

52:41.450 --> 52:43.117
Greenbridge Estate.

52:43.244 --> 52:45.119
My dad owns it.

52:45.246 --> 52:46.453
The gymnasium is cool
and all,

52:46.581 --> 52:48.414
but if I'm gonna do this whole
teenybopper thing

52:48.541 --> 52:50.666
I'm gonna need to make
some changes.

52:50.793 --> 52:54.128
Bethany... would you do us
the honour?

52:54.255 --> 52:56.130
You're both asking me
to prom?

52:56.257 --> 52:57.381
Otherwise we'd have to duel.

52:57.508 --> 52:58.465
To the death.

52:58.593 --> 53:01.093
Or until Zeke starts crying.

53:01.220 --> 53:02.136
An ugly cry.

53:02.263 --> 53:03.053
Ok, ok.

53:03.181 --> 53:04.013
Yeah, yeah.

53:04.140 --> 53:05.055
I'll go to the prom with you.

53:09.187 --> 53:10.561
Cool.

53:10.688 --> 53:11.687
Great.

53:11.814 --> 53:13.147
This was a bad idea,
wasn't it?

53:13.274 --> 53:14.732
( together )
Yes.

53:17.528 --> 53:19.486
Thanks for all your help
on the prom.

53:19.614 --> 53:22.156
I'm surprised that you
even care.

53:22.283 --> 53:26.160
Yeah, well, caring about school
things is kind of new to me.

53:26.287 --> 53:27.828
Prom isn't school.

53:29.290 --> 53:30.331
Oh, Bethany.

53:30.458 --> 53:31.457
Come here.

53:36.047 --> 53:40.090
So, ladies,
Bethany has a problem.

53:40.218 --> 53:41.592
I do?

53:41.719 --> 53:45.221
She has two dates to
the prom but no dress.

53:45.348 --> 53:46.680
Anyone down for
a shopping trip?

53:46.807 --> 53:47.681
Seriously?

53:50.102 --> 53:51.477
I would love to.

53:52.104 --> 53:54.772
♪

53:54.899 --> 53:56.440
Cool.

53:56.567 --> 54:10.037
♪

54:10.164 --> 54:13.415
Did you go shopping
without me?

54:13.542 --> 54:14.541
I did.

54:14.669 --> 54:16.335
And I bought a prom dress.

54:18.756 --> 54:21.006
When the king sees you in this

54:21.133 --> 54:24.051
he is totally gonna choose
you as his consort.

54:24.178 --> 54:26.679
Yeah, I don't know about
that whole consort thing.

54:26.806 --> 54:28.764
I mean, I know he's our king
and everything

54:28.891 --> 54:32.476
but he kinda sounds
like a douche-bag.

54:32.603 --> 54:34.895
Is it as much fun as
I thought it would be?

54:35.022 --> 54:36.188
Being human?

54:36.315 --> 54:37.940
I'm not a human.

54:38.067 --> 54:41.026
You know what I mean.

54:41.153 --> 54:43.237
Sometimes.

54:43.364 --> 54:44.905
Sometimes it is.

54:45.032 --> 54:50.327
( hammering )

54:50.454 --> 54:51.745
Wow.

54:51.872 --> 54:54.081
Mother is really going
all out on the security.

54:54.208 --> 54:56.125
We can't have any
students escape.

54:56.252 --> 54:58.419
I can't wait for the feast.

54:58.546 --> 55:01.255
High school boys
are so tasty.

55:09.598 --> 55:13.475
Pearl, I'm proud of you
for pulling all this together.

55:13.602 --> 55:15.686
Thank you, mother.

55:15.813 --> 55:17.855
But I was thinking
about something.

55:17.982 --> 55:20.441
There are a few students
that could be really helpful

55:20.568 --> 55:24.069
in terms of making Greenbridge
High a long-term hunting ground.

55:24.196 --> 55:26.739
Would it be possible
to spare a few of them?

55:26.866 --> 55:28.949
I'm afraid not.

55:29.076 --> 55:30.826
The king has changed
the plan.

55:30.953 --> 55:32.453
He wants a blood bath.

55:32.580 --> 55:34.079
Everyone will be drained,

55:34.206 --> 55:36.415
then we'll burn down the estate
to cover it up.

55:36.542 --> 55:39.001
It will be a true feast.

55:39.128 --> 55:41.086
All thanks to you.

55:44.258 --> 55:46.467
Blood bath.

55:46.594 --> 55:49.053
All thanks to you.

55:49.180 --> 55:50.387
What?

55:50.514 --> 55:51.847
Prom is gonna be awesome,
thanks to you.

55:51.974 --> 55:54.892
Yeah, I think the whole
school's going.

55:55.019 --> 55:56.477
No.

55:56.604 --> 55:58.604
We have to cancel prom.

55:58.731 --> 56:00.606
We have to cancel prom!

56:00.733 --> 56:02.816
There are going to be vampires
hiding in the cellar

56:02.943 --> 56:03.901
waiting to kill you.

56:04.028 --> 56:06.111
( laughing )

56:06.238 --> 56:07.613
<i>I'm not joking.</i>

56:07.740 --> 56:08.489
<i>Here, I'll show you.</i>

56:10.117 --> 56:11.784
We need to talk.

56:11.911 --> 56:13.285
Please don't fight me.

56:13.412 --> 56:15.162
And keep your fangs in.

56:15.289 --> 56:16.955
Yeah, I know who you are.

56:18.709 --> 56:19.750
( clears throat )

56:19.877 --> 56:22.753
Vampires, yeah, guys,
new prom theme!

56:22.880 --> 56:24.129
Whoo!

56:26.634 --> 56:28.550
Where are you taking me?

56:28.677 --> 56:30.177
It's time for you to know
who I am.

56:30.304 --> 56:31.136
Excuse me?

56:34.141 --> 56:36.100
( falcon screeches )

56:36.227 --> 56:37.393
You.

56:37.520 --> 56:38.852
You're the slayer.

56:48.030 --> 56:49.863
( falcon screeches )

56:49.990 --> 56:51.115
I'm not a slayer.

56:51.242 --> 56:54.326
The rest of my family,
they're slayers.

56:54.453 --> 56:55.702
I'm the healer.

56:55.830 --> 56:56.995
What does that mean?

56:59.708 --> 57:00.624
What are you doing?

57:02.253 --> 57:02.793
Evan!

57:02.920 --> 57:03.627
Just wait.

57:12.847 --> 57:15.722
I don't know what I am,
or where I came from,

57:15.850 --> 57:17.182
but I know why I'm here.

57:17.309 --> 57:21.311
I can help you.

57:21.439 --> 57:25.649
You're the reason I can walk
in the sunlight.

57:25.776 --> 57:27.401
And- and I have a reflection.

57:27.528 --> 57:28.986
You're the reason that
I have a-

57:29.113 --> 57:31.780
Conscience. Yes.

57:31.907 --> 57:33.657
You.

57:33.784 --> 57:36.410
Do you have any idea
what you've done?!

57:36.537 --> 57:37.327
You changed me!

57:37.455 --> 57:38.912
You ruined my whole family!

57:39.039 --> 57:40.080
My whole life!

57:40.207 --> 57:42.040
I'm sorry!

57:42.168 --> 57:43.250
I'm sorry.

57:47.006 --> 57:48.088
Are you really?

57:49.800 --> 57:51.008
No.

57:53.554 --> 57:55.554
Why me?

57:55.681 --> 57:57.431
I've been watching you.

57:57.558 --> 57:58.765
You're so confident.

57:58.893 --> 58:00.517
Like nothing can stop you.

58:00.644 --> 58:05.439
I thought if I can change you
I can change anyone.

58:08.944 --> 58:12.237
And he thought you were hot.

58:12.364 --> 58:15.073
I take it you're in on this
circle of worms secret.

58:15.201 --> 58:18.911
Evan's the one who healed me
when...

58:19.038 --> 58:22.915
When my dad bit you.

58:23.042 --> 58:24.458
Yeah.

58:24.585 --> 58:27.169
But god, when Evan- when
Evan heals, people are animals.

58:27.296 --> 58:30.047
They're always a bit better.

58:30.174 --> 58:32.674
Gooder.

58:32.801 --> 58:34.843
That's not a word.

58:34.970 --> 58:36.512
Well, it should be.

58:36.639 --> 58:38.972
We thought what if
I healed a vampire?

58:39.099 --> 58:40.641
What would happen?

58:40.768 --> 58:41.725
So I'm your guinea pig?

58:41.852 --> 58:43.060
No, no, no.

58:43.187 --> 58:44.811
We- we never thought
of you like that.

58:44.939 --> 58:47.231
You are a new species.

58:47.358 --> 58:48.315
Of one.

58:48.442 --> 58:51.735
Until the Fealty Ceremony.

58:51.862 --> 58:53.820
You know about
the Fealty Ceremony?

58:53.948 --> 58:56.615
My family's been hunting
vampires for generations.

58:56.742 --> 58:59.034
We know a lot.

58:59.161 --> 59:00.077
The blood exchange.

59:00.204 --> 59:01.203
Exactly.

59:01.330 --> 59:03.747
You are like a carrier now.

59:03.874 --> 59:06.083
And when the king drinks
your blood-

59:06.210 --> 59:07.709
And then everyone drinks
from him...

59:07.836 --> 59:09.628
All the vampires
will be infected.

59:09.755 --> 59:10.712
Cured.

59:10.839 --> 59:12.256
I prefer the term "enlightened".

59:12.383 --> 59:15.259
Ok, well, there's just
one problem.

59:17.388 --> 59:18.345
Prom.

59:20.474 --> 59:21.473
Ok, so it'll take a while
for the enlightenment

59:21.600 --> 59:22.641
to take effect.

59:22.768 --> 59:24.476
The vampires will still
want a feast.

59:24.603 --> 59:26.562
What happens if
we just cancel prom?

59:26.689 --> 59:28.230
The king will cancel
the ceremony

59:28.357 --> 59:29.773
and my family will kill me.

59:29.900 --> 59:31.400
Literally.

59:31.527 --> 59:32.776
They're gonna stake me and
you won't be there to heal me.

59:32.903 --> 59:33.944
There has to be a way to go
through the ceremony

59:34.071 --> 59:36.989
and still keep everyone safe.

59:37.116 --> 59:38.699
What about your family?

59:38.826 --> 59:39.783
Would they help?

59:39.910 --> 59:40.826
They would.

59:40.953 --> 59:42.035
If they knew about you.

59:42.162 --> 59:43.662
Which they don't.

59:45.833 --> 59:48.000
You are so grounded.

59:48.127 --> 59:50.752
You invited a vampire
into our house?

59:50.879 --> 59:52.588
She's not like other vampires.

59:52.715 --> 59:54.548
Does she drink blood?

59:54.675 --> 59:57.634
She slept next to me last night
and didn't bite me.

59:57.761 --> 01:00:00.053
She slept in your room
all night?!

01:00:00.180 --> 01:00:02.347
Yeah, you probably should
have left that detail out.

01:00:02.474 --> 01:00:04.808
I haven't bitten anyone
since he healed me.

01:00:06.854 --> 01:00:07.769
Well, except for another
vampire,

01:00:07.896 --> 01:00:10.355
but he totally deserved it.

01:00:10.482 --> 01:00:12.274
Look, I- I understand
why you're upset.

01:00:12.401 --> 01:00:15.360
I was upset when
I found out.

01:00:15.487 --> 01:00:16.528
I didn't ask for this.

01:00:16.655 --> 01:00:20.032
I didn't ask for feelings
or friends.

01:00:20.159 --> 01:00:22.868
My life was good.

01:00:22.995 --> 01:00:25.078
But now it's better.

01:00:25.205 --> 01:00:26.663
Gooder.

01:00:28.542 --> 01:00:30.417
You know that's not
a real word.

01:00:30.544 --> 01:00:36.048
Well... it should be.

01:00:45.184 --> 01:00:47.601
Looks like we'll be chaperoning
the prom.

01:00:51.440 --> 01:00:52.898
I thought my family was scary.

01:00:53.025 --> 01:00:54.024
You should see them fight
over the shower in the morning.

01:00:54.151 --> 01:00:54.941
Ok, focus!

01:00:55.069 --> 01:00:56.401
People, we have two days.

01:00:56.528 --> 01:00:59.655
The future of the universe
depends on us.

01:00:59.782 --> 01:01:02.115
We're vampires, not aliens.

01:01:02.242 --> 01:01:05.577
Ok, at sundown the students will
arrive upstairs for the prom.

01:01:05.704 --> 01:01:07.579
The vampires through the
tunnels and in the wine cellar

01:01:07.706 --> 01:01:09.081
for the Fealty Ceremony.

01:01:09.208 --> 01:01:10.874
How much time do we have
between the blood exchange

01:01:11.001 --> 01:01:11.750
and the feast?

01:01:11.877 --> 01:01:12.959
About an hour.

01:01:13.087 --> 01:01:14.294
There's a lot of dancing first.

01:01:14.421 --> 01:01:15.754
Vampires like to tango.

01:01:15.881 --> 01:01:17.798
There are two sets of stairs
leading from the cellar

01:01:17.925 --> 01:01:19.091
up to the ballroom.

01:01:19.218 --> 01:01:21.301
We'll need guards stationed
throughout.

01:01:21.428 --> 01:01:22.886
Marcus and Alan, you take
the front entrance.

01:01:23.013 --> 01:01:25.305
William and Steve, the hall.

01:01:25.432 --> 01:01:27.891
Remember to keep your weapons
loaded and be ready to fight.

01:01:28.018 --> 01:01:30.060
Sherry and Tina,
you'll patrol the grounds.

01:01:30.187 --> 01:01:31.687
Make sure none of the students
sneak out.

01:01:31.814 --> 01:01:34.606
We can't afford to leave anybody
behind during the evacuation.

01:01:34.733 --> 01:01:36.066
All we have to do is hold
the entrances

01:01:36.193 --> 01:01:37.776
until the evacuation
is complete.

01:01:37.903 --> 01:01:39.236
What about the tunnels?

01:01:39.363 --> 01:01:41.113
What if some of the vampires
escape through those

01:01:41.240 --> 01:01:42.531
and then double back?

01:01:42.658 --> 01:01:44.658
The nearest entrance
is five miles away.

01:01:44.785 --> 01:01:47.285
Once we- or they realize

01:01:47.413 --> 01:01:50.288
that something's wrong with
the feast, a few might try.

01:01:50.416 --> 01:01:53.041
So we complete the
evacuation before they notice.

01:01:53.168 --> 01:01:54.710
Zero casualties on either side.

01:01:54.837 --> 01:01:56.336
What about all the students?

01:01:56.463 --> 01:01:59.047
You think they're just gonna
willingly leave their prom?

01:01:59.174 --> 01:02:01.216
Peer pressure is
a powerful thing.

01:02:01.343 --> 01:02:02.634
Get a few influential
students,

01:02:02.761 --> 01:02:04.636
create a reason to leave
and the rest will follow.

01:02:04.763 --> 01:02:05.721
Absolutely not.

01:02:05.848 --> 01:02:07.389
No, we cannot trust
students-

01:02:07.516 --> 01:02:09.641
You trust students.

01:02:09.768 --> 01:02:12.853
Well, yes, but they are
all trained slayers.

01:02:12.980 --> 01:02:16.314
Your classmates have
no knowledge of vampires.

01:02:16.442 --> 01:02:18.358
Have you turned on the TV
in the last five years?

01:02:18.485 --> 01:02:21.194
I mean, there's Twilight,
True Blood, Vampire Diaries.

01:02:21.321 --> 01:02:22.654
She's right.

01:02:22.781 --> 01:02:24.030
There's a whole section at
Barnes & Nobel dedicated

01:02:24.158 --> 01:02:27.075
to teen vampire romances.

01:02:27.202 --> 01:02:28.076
Everyone knows about vampires.

01:02:28.203 --> 01:02:29.953
It's not gonna be easy.

01:02:30.080 --> 01:02:31.329
Some people might not
believe us.

01:02:31.457 --> 01:02:35.584
There's gonna be a lot of
people that are scared.

01:02:35.711 --> 01:02:37.210
But it's our best shot.

01:02:38.922 --> 01:02:40.046
Ok.

01:02:43.844 --> 01:02:44.801
I knew it!

01:02:44.928 --> 01:02:46.887
This is so cool!

01:02:47.014 --> 01:02:48.346
Aren't any of you scared?

01:02:48.474 --> 01:02:49.765
Or shocked?

01:02:49.892 --> 01:02:52.350
Well, I would be
if I believed you.

01:02:52.478 --> 01:02:53.977
Show them your fangs.

01:03:05.699 --> 01:03:07.574
( screams )

01:03:07.701 --> 01:03:09.409
I'm not gonna hurt you.

01:03:09.536 --> 01:03:12.412
She's a good vampire now.

01:03:12.539 --> 01:03:13.163
Wait...

01:03:14.333 --> 01:03:15.499
Ashlyn, you-

01:03:15.626 --> 01:03:18.835
Yes. My parents have
been feeding on her.

01:03:18.962 --> 01:03:20.253
But that's why I need
your help.

01:03:20.380 --> 01:03:21.963
There's about 100 vampires
waiting to chomp down

01:03:22.090 --> 01:03:23.507
on everyone at prom.

01:03:23.634 --> 01:03:25.675
We need to evacuate the prom
before that happens.

01:03:25.803 --> 01:03:27.511
If you lead the way
everyone will follow.

01:03:27.638 --> 01:03:29.387
Yeah, just tell them that
there's, like, a gas leak

01:03:29.515 --> 01:03:30.889
or something.

01:03:31.016 --> 01:03:32.057
Or- or you can tell them
that Drake is, like, performing

01:03:32.184 --> 01:03:33.600
a secret show at
one of the after parties.

01:03:33.727 --> 01:03:35.519
Just... seriously, anything
to get them out of the prom

01:03:35.646 --> 01:03:37.229
and into the after parties.

01:03:37.356 --> 01:03:39.898
Vampires aren't allowed into
homes unless they're invited.

01:03:40.025 --> 01:03:41.483
Good to know.

01:03:41.610 --> 01:03:43.860
It's either that or we cancel
the prom.

01:03:43.987 --> 01:03:44.611
No!

01:03:46.573 --> 01:03:48.865
So, does that mean you're in?

01:03:48.992 --> 01:03:52.077
Dude, this is like our dream.

01:03:52.204 --> 01:03:54.538
This will make the world
a better place.

01:03:54.665 --> 01:03:56.164
Screw the world.

01:03:56.291 --> 01:03:58.291
No one messes with my prom.

01:04:07.719 --> 01:04:09.052
You know, most people
the morning of their proms

01:04:09.179 --> 01:04:10.679
go get pedicures.

01:04:10.806 --> 01:04:13.098
I thought all we had to do
was hold the two cellar doors?

01:04:13.225 --> 01:04:15.100
Well, this is in case some
get through.

01:04:15.227 --> 01:04:16.768
Once the students have made
their way across the parking lot

01:04:16.895 --> 01:04:19.271
we can connect the gas pipes,
light the fire,

01:04:19.398 --> 01:04:21.273
and that'll keep the vampires
contained.

01:04:21.400 --> 01:04:23.733
We're putting buckets of
holy water above every entrance.

01:04:23.861 --> 01:04:24.651
<i>Nice work.</i>

01:04:24.778 --> 01:04:26.152

01:04:26.280 --> 01:04:26.987
Crossbow.

01:04:27.114 --> 01:04:28.363
Good work, boys.

01:04:28.490 --> 01:04:30.365
My mom said we can get ready
at my place.

01:04:30.492 --> 01:04:31.950
Oh, I should probably go
home first.

01:04:32.077 --> 01:04:34.119
Oh, uh, actually your stuff
is all in my car.

01:04:34.246 --> 01:04:35.787
I need your- your help
with my make-up.

01:04:35.914 --> 01:04:37.247
And your hair.

01:04:37.374 --> 01:04:38.415
And my bow tie.

01:04:41.420 --> 01:04:42.586
You don't trust me.

01:04:42.713 --> 01:04:43.879
Bingo.

Like I said, no one,
and I mean no one,

01:04:47.801 --> 01:04:49.676
is messing with my prom.

01:04:57.936 --> 01:04:59.227
Wait 'til you see her.

01:04:59.354 --> 01:05:00.854

Leaving so soon, are we?

01:16:05.186 --> 01:16:07.728
I'm just checking
on the feast.

01:16:07.855 --> 01:16:09.355
Don't want to disappoint
the king.

01:16:09.482 --> 01:16:12.024
I knew you were changing but
I didn't want to believe it.

01:16:12.151 --> 01:16:12.984
What do you mean?

01:16:13.111 --> 01:16:14.860
I saw your reflection!

01:16:14.988 --> 01:16:15.653
<i>( crowd gasps )</i>
<i>What?</i>

01:16:15.780 --> 01:16:17.113
In the goblet.

01:16:19.450 --> 01:16:20.616
Quiet!

01:16:28.960 --> 01:16:31.085
Explain yourself.

01:16:31.212 --> 01:16:32.211
Forgive me, your majesty.

01:16:32.338 --> 01:16:35.423
Repeat what you said.

01:16:35.550 --> 01:16:39.218
<i>She has a reflection.</i>

01:16:39.345 --> 01:16:42.430
<i>I saw it in the goblet.</i>

01:16:42.557 --> 01:16:45.433
I drank your blood tonight.

01:16:45.560 --> 01:16:47.852
Yes.

01:16:47.979 --> 01:16:50.521
Child, have you seen
the sun rise?

01:16:50.648 --> 01:16:51.230
I have.

<i>( crowd gasps )</i>

01:16:57.989 --> 01:17:00.615
She is a miracle.

01:17:00.742 --> 01:17:02.533
She will bring honour
and power to you.

01:17:02.660 --> 01:17:04.619
( hisses )

01:17:04.746 --> 01:17:06.203
You are an abomination.

01:17:06.331 --> 01:17:09.248
You are not a vampire.

01:17:09.375 --> 01:17:11.626
Yes, I am!

01:17:11.753 --> 01:17:14.211
But I have changed.

01:17:14.339 --> 01:17:17.006
We can live together
with the humans in the light.

01:17:21.220 --> 01:17:23.095
Live in the sunlight.

01:17:28.811 --> 01:17:32.647
Well, that would be wonderful,
except...

01:17:32.774 --> 01:17:35.441
I like the darkness.

01:17:39.030 --> 01:17:40.738
Who will save you now?

01:17:51.376 --> 01:17:52.208
I will.

I know you told me
to stay upstairs.

I forgive you.

C'mon, hurry!!

01:19:19.714 --> 01:19:20.421
Go light the planters!

01:19:20.548 --> 01:19:21.380
No, we're not leaving you!

I'm trying!

01:19:29.766 --> 01:19:30.806
Give it.

01:19:33.770 --> 01:19:34.894
Got it! Go!

Mother.

Go! Hurry!

They're headed for the tunnels!

01:20:03.758 --> 01:20:04.924
Get everyone out of here!

01:20:06.177 --> 01:20:07.218
Go, everybody!

01:20:07.345 --> 01:20:08.302
Get inside a house,
lock the doors,

01:20:08.429 --> 01:20:10.805
don't let anyone
out until sunrise!

01:20:10.932 --> 01:20:12.431
Go! Go! Go! Hurry!

01:20:12.558 --> 01:20:13.349
Pearly.

01:20:13.476 --> 01:20:14.517
Stop this.

01:20:14.644 --> 01:20:16.101
Come home.

01:20:16.229 --> 01:20:17.812
I'm sorry.

01:20:17.939 --> 01:20:20.439
You are, aren't you?

01:20:20.566 --> 01:20:21.732
How strange.

01:20:21.859 --> 01:20:24.109
I did this for all of us.

01:20:24.237 --> 01:20:25.778
You're gonna love
the daylight.

01:20:30.243 --> 01:20:32.284
Pearl, time to go.

01:20:32.411 --> 01:20:34.078
I'll see you later, dad.

01:20:34.997 --> 01:20:36.747
I hope so.

01:20:36.874 --> 01:20:37.414
<i>Where to?</i>

01:20:37.542 --> 01:20:38.916
My house.

01:20:39.043 --> 01:20:39.959
Your house is too far.

01:20:40.086 --> 01:20:41.210
We have to get
somewhere safe.

01:20:41.337 --> 01:20:42.753
Ashlyn's house is
just down the street!

01:20:42.880 --> 01:20:45.631
But you said vampires
have to be invited in!

01:21:04.068 --> 01:21:04.984
Get in!

01:21:08.114 --> 01:21:09.071
I promise I'm not gonna
hurt you,

01:21:09.198 --> 01:21:11.657
just invite me inside, please.

01:21:11.784 --> 01:21:13.951
Oh, I don't think so.

01:21:14.078 --> 01:21:15.160
Poor Pearl.

01:21:16.706 --> 01:21:18.914
So much for living together
in the light.

01:21:27.008 --> 01:21:30.801
( fighting grunts )

01:21:33.723 --> 01:21:34.889
Do you know how grateful
the king will be

01:21:35.016 --> 01:21:36.432
once I return
with your corpse?

01:21:37.310 --> 01:21:38.851
( fighting grunts )

01:21:40.396 --> 01:21:42.313
I won't need your family's
power anymore.

01:21:42.440 --> 01:21:43.606
I'll have my own.

01:21:44.483 --> 01:21:46.150
( fighting grunts )

01:21:47.945 --> 01:21:49.486
It's too bad, really.

01:21:49.614 --> 01:21:51.238
We were good together.

01:21:51.365 --> 01:21:54.408
We were just alike.

01:21:54.535 --> 01:21:56.452
I can't wait for you
to feel it.

01:21:56.579 --> 01:21:57.369
What?

01:21:58.748 --> 01:22:00.039
Sunshine.

01:22:03.878 --> 01:22:05.377
You drank the king's blood.

01:22:05.504 --> 01:22:06.921
You drank my blood.

01:22:07.048 --> 01:22:09.548
You're gonna be
just like me.

01:22:12.219 --> 01:22:17.640
( fighting grunts )

01:22:17.767 --> 01:22:18.557
Stop!

01:22:19.644 --> 01:22:20.809
Please.

01:22:20.937 --> 01:22:22.770
Why do you care about
these humans?

01:22:22.897 --> 01:22:24.396
You'll never fit in.

01:22:26.984 --> 01:22:29.318
I already do.

01:22:29.445 --> 01:22:30.861
They knew that I was a vampire

01:22:30.988 --> 01:22:33.280
and they still wanted
to help me.

01:22:33.407 --> 01:22:35.950
It doesn't have to be us
against them.

01:22:36.077 --> 01:22:37.534
Please, Antoinette,
you're my family.

01:22:37.662 --> 01:22:39.662
I don't wanna lose you.

01:22:39.789 --> 01:22:42.247

I thought you were invincible.

Do you know how much energy
it takes to heal a vampire?

01:23:26.335 --> 01:23:28.377
After you, I could
barely walk for days.

That the plan worked.

Bethany up on her offer
