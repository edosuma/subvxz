02:01.988 --> 02:02.966
Everybody off!

02:05.925 --> 02:07.097
This could be Russians.

02:07.293 --> 02:09.068
Don't worry about that, get off the bus.

02:09.429 --> 02:10.430
Where are we going'?

02:10.797 --> 02:11.798
Somewhere safe.

02:15.869 --> 02:17.644
GO, go!

02:25.044 --> 02:27.422
Today is a very special day,

02:28.715 --> 02:31.457
for everyone that has been Working
with John Henderson.

02:34.154 --> 02:38.694
He is a tireless leader
that has made the arms industry

02:38.791 --> 02:43.501
in the United States the most
powerful industry in the world.

03:51.464 --> 03:52.909
Mojito por favor.

04:10.850 --> 04:11.885
Segura.

04:50.156 --> 04:51.362
Now the annual budgets

04:51.524 --> 04:54.004
were presented
at the last stockholders meeting.

04:55.595 --> 04:57.700
And they included a special entry

04:58.564 --> 05:02.239
for we were all convinced
will be the project,

05:02.635 --> 05:06.777
the Warranties,
the future of our great company.

05:36.269 --> 05:38.749
He is the father of this project,

05:39.072 --> 05:42.451
and no one better than him
to explain to us all about it.

05:44.110 --> 05:45.214
Ladies and gentlemen,

05:46.079 --> 05:49.060
with all of you,
Mr. John Henderson.

06:18.010 --> 06:20.047
I didn't know I was so important.

06:25.485 --> 06:30.093
It has been over thirty years since
this dream opened its doors.

06:30.423 --> 06:33.165
And, like all big dreams,

06:33.760 --> 06:36.673
it must come to an end, even for me.

06:48.908 --> 06:50.012
Good evening.

07:25.878 --> 07:27.084
So...

07:29.148 --> 07:30.957
how do you like my club'?

07:33.085 --> 07:34.120
It's not bad.

07:34.987 --> 07:38.059
I think its a little bit more
than that, no'?

07:39.826 --> 07:44.104
Well I ah, it's a matter of taste.

07:45.631 --> 07:46.735
Sit down.

07:52.071 --> 07:55.143
It wasn't easy to find him.

07:56.442 --> 07:57.978
But we located him,

07:59.111 --> 08:00.021
in Syria.

08:01.013 --> 08:02.822
Syria is a big place.

08:03.049 --> 08:05.495
That information will cost you more.

08:16.996 --> 08:17.838
Da!

08:24.270 --> 08:27.046
Put two hundred thousand
in this account,

08:27.406 --> 08:28.612
and come back.

08:32.044 --> 08:36.015
And now I'm sorry, I'm too busy.

08:51.030 --> 08:52.008
Mischa!

09:01.274 --> 09:04.084
It's not the Way to talk to a lady.

09:05.044 --> 09:06.421
Easy my friend.

09:09.148 --> 09:12.357
That wasn't the deal,
you've already been paid, so please

09:12.552 --> 09:15.965
just tell me what city he's in'?

09:19.025 --> 09:21.062
Before I leave the company I began,

09:21.594 --> 09:25.132
I will leave my final research
behind as my legacy.

09:25.932 --> 09:27.639
And Legacy is a big word.

09:28.067 --> 09:30.445
Legacy, it means so much.

09:39.111 --> 09:40.647
There in thirty seconds.

10:58.991 --> 11:00.061
I got it.

11:01.293 --> 11:01.998
Great.

11:02.595 --> 11:04.802
Okay my friend. Have a nice day.

11:07.266 --> 11:08.609
Nothing personal.

11:09.602 --> 11:10.580
Catch!

11:26.152 --> 11:27.324
I look at my wife,

11:27.987 --> 11:31.127
and I see someone who has spent
all these years

11:31.791 --> 11:35.068
fighting along side me.
Thank you darling, I love you.

11:37.363 --> 11:39.206
Without her and my daughter...

11:40.166 --> 11:41.611
I love you too, baby.

11:41.801 --> 11:44.680
I would never have come this far.

11:46.172 --> 11:48.243
Hey, did I show you a picture
of my little girl'?

11:53.045 --> 11:54.524
- That's your baby?
- Yep.

11:55.681 --> 11:58.992
Well, thank God there's more
to life than beauty contests.

11:59.051 --> 12:02.760
You cheeky fuckin' bastard.
Bugger off.

12:03.322 --> 12:04.282
Thank you all very much.

12:04.423 --> 12:05.367
I am very flattered

12:05.558 --> 12:08.038
and I will remember this every day
for the rest of my life.

12:08.094 --> 12:09.129
Thank you so much.

12:25.411 --> 12:26.082
Ladies and gentlemen,

12:26.245 --> 12:30.125
we are now all been waiting for
the files you all had from the project.

12:30.349 --> 12:32.955
So we kindly ask you for
a little bit of patience.

12:33.085 --> 12:33.961
Thank you.

12:39.091 --> 12:41.469
That's the last time
I fuck the mark on a job.

12:41.827 --> 12:42.771
What about the cameras?

12:45.564 --> 12:46.702
I took care of it.

13:31.110 --> 13:32.521
You earned it.

13:34.513 --> 13:37.050
I earned the million dollars.

13:37.550 --> 13:40.292
I'll take that as a down payment.

13:40.853 --> 13:42.127
Don't scare me.

13:43.189 --> 13:45.328
What do we know
about Balanosvky'?

13:45.891 --> 13:47.495
We're going to try
and kill him tomorrow.

13:49.995 --> 13:50.837
Where'?

13:50.930 --> 13:52.136
On the bus.

13:52.565 --> 13:54.511
Alan has all the information.

14:11.650 --> 14:13.323
He's taking too long.

14:14.854 --> 14:17.528
Take it easy, relax,
you want some wine'?

14:39.745 --> 14:41.418
I'm going to go get dressed.

14:52.391 --> 14:53.335
Too bad.

14:58.597 --> 14:59.507
Anything yet?

14:59.832 --> 15:00.572
No!

15:13.445 --> 15:14.583
That's him.

15:32.531 --> 15:34.135
That was unbelievable.

15:36.235 --> 15:37.275
Can I smoke in your house?

15:37.436 --> 15:39.347
Everybody smokes in my house.

15:42.308 --> 15:43.651
We got a location.

15:44.310 --> 15:45.118
Yeah?

15:47.046 --> 15:48.218
For both of them'?

15:49.515 --> 15:51.620
Yeah, for both of them.

15:57.189 --> 15:58.600
I need the tests.

15:59.391 --> 16:01.962
Well, we are leaving
for Tenerife in two hours

16:02.161 --> 16:04.368
and they leave
for Syria in the morning.

16:04.797 --> 16:07.937
So, we'll have all the information
in forty-eight hours.

16:09.001 --> 16:12.380
The Russians... want him dead.

16:13.072 --> 16:14.779
Don't worry about that.

16:15.908 --> 16:17.512
We've got it under control.

16:19.445 --> 16:20.719
Here's the money.

16:23.649 --> 16:25.356
You can count it if you like.

16:26.085 --> 16:27.359
We trust you.

16:31.290 --> 16:35.136
When you have Belinovski,
please... let me know.

16:36.996 --> 16:38.202
All right.

16:51.443 --> 16:52.922
Excuez moi!

16:54.947 --> 16:56.085
Good evening gentlemen.

17:11.262 --> 17:12.606
Said you trusted him'?

17:14.199 --> 17:15.233
I lied.

17:23.008 --> 17:24.851
You owe me the full package.

17:26.310 --> 17:27.983
I'm going to count this.

17:28.113 --> 17:29.217
You should.

17:31.517 --> 17:34.964
Okay, I'm going to take the car,
take care my friend.

17:35.454 --> 17:37.058
- See you later.
- See you.

17:37.489 --> 17:39.662
Hey, start packing.

19:07.312 --> 19:08.256
Go!

19:24.663 --> 19:25.403
Salem!

19:25.831 --> 19:26.434
Salem!

19:27.199 --> 19:28.007
Salem!

19:39.111 --> 19:40.613
You speak Arab?

19:40.913 --> 19:41.914
No.

19:43.315 --> 19:44.760
Have you got the money'?

19:45.284 --> 19:47.025
Yeah, he's seen it.

19:52.090 --> 19:53.296
MSac.

20:51.483 --> 20:52.689
Thanks for coming.

21:08.033 --> 21:09.137
Take it.

21:09.601 --> 21:12.138
You just sealed your fate.

21:24.149 --> 21:25.753
Drugs don't interest me.

21:29.054 --> 21:30.328
Tell me, ah...

21:32.891 --> 21:34.666
you recognize this'?

21:37.929 --> 21:39.033
Take a look.

21:40.032 --> 21:42.308
You're the one next to Baumgartner,

21:43.001 --> 21:44.036
Mr. Kranz.

21:51.043 --> 21:52.613
I want those coordinates.

21:57.482 --> 22:00.622
I won't ask twice.

22:02.087 --> 22:07.059
- Coordinates are useless Without...
- We have Balanosvky.

22:16.001 --> 22:19.278
You don't know
what you are getting into.

22:23.642 --> 22:24.848
All right.

22:43.895 --> 22:44.930
Where are we going'?

22:45.430 --> 22:46.602
Somewhere safe.

22:47.432 --> 22:49.434
Go, go, go!

23:02.247 --> 23:03.282
Who are you'?

23:23.168 --> 23:24.738
We saved your life.

23:26.838 --> 23:29.785
If you collaborate...
we may save it again.

23:48.360 --> 23:49.532
End of the line.

24:17.522 --> 24:19.126
You were a hard man to find.

24:21.760 --> 24:23.364
Mr. Balanosvky.

24:29.167 --> 24:30.578
Can I see your wallet?

24:31.169 --> 24:32.079
Please!

24:35.707 --> 24:40.588
There's always trouble
to steal my Wallet.

24:44.249 --> 24:45.319
Very funny,

24:45.951 --> 24:47.294
yeah very funny.

24:48.753 --> 24:51.199
Robert Michaela.

25:05.837 --> 25:07.441
You look better in a uniform.

25:08.306 --> 25:09.216
Don't you'?

25:14.045 --> 25:17.219
Don't worry, we won't hand
you over to the Russians.

25:17.516 --> 25:19.462
That's not Why we are here.

25:28.593 --> 25:30.732
I don't know what
you're talking about.

26:05.931 --> 26:06.966
We have the old man.

26:08.033 --> 26:10.570
Yeah well,
we have the coordinates.

26:12.003 --> 26:14.449
But ah,
I think we're being followed.

26:16.041 --> 26:16.849
Russian?

26:18.343 --> 26:19.321
Yeah.

26:20.312 --> 26:21.518
Then split up.

26:21.846 --> 26:23.052
We can't take any chances.

26:23.949 --> 26:24.620
Okay.

26:25.850 --> 26:26.760
Got to go.

27:03.388 --> 27:04.696
It's all there.

27:05.824 --> 27:06.564
Good.

27:07.292 --> 27:09.294
If this, go out...

27:09.761 --> 27:10.933
You're on your own.

27:11.229 --> 27:12.902
That goes without saying.

27:13.331 --> 27:16.107
You have seventy-two hours.

27:23.375 --> 27:24.683
You ever eat cat'?

27:26.745 --> 27:27.723
What?

27:28.013 --> 27:30.653
Them dirty face cat eating
yellow-faced Chinese bastards...

27:30.749 --> 27:32.456
fucking out of me.

27:32.684 --> 27:34.755
Little dicks, fuckin' cunts.

27:56.041 --> 27:58.715
They're Korean you English fuck.

28:02.013 --> 28:04.015
They don't eat cats,

28:05.684 --> 28:07.095
they eat dogs.

28:33.478 --> 28:35.617
I think you should see this.

28:42.187 --> 28:43.632
How did you find him'?

28:47.158 --> 28:50.765
We have the coordinates;
You have the codes...

28:53.131 --> 28:56.203
now we all need the key.

29:00.105 --> 29:01.550
Who is behind this,

29:05.143 --> 29:06.486
Who hired you'?

29:11.049 --> 29:14.087
Looks like old times, Comrade.

29:19.591 --> 29:20.865
Rudolph?

29:22.927 --> 29:25.373
Your Rudolph died thirty years ago;

29:25.530 --> 29:28.568
I am a respectable
American citizen now.

29:29.868 --> 29:31.142
Respectable'?

29:31.336 --> 29:33.612
Yes, I've done quite well for myself.

29:33.772 --> 29:35.149
Look, I hate to put
you guys through this,

29:35.240 --> 29:39.017
but you know how
persistent I can be.

29:39.344 --> 29:42.018
I had to fake my research
being stolen

29:42.080 --> 29:44.117
until I came up with the formula.

29:45.650 --> 29:47.323
You're out of your mind.

29:48.453 --> 29:49.727
Well, in today's times,

29:49.854 --> 29:52.994
you have to be out of your mind
if you have my kind of ambition.

29:53.158 --> 29:55.069
I want Project 12!

29:57.962 --> 29:59.600
You will deliver it to me.

30:03.234 --> 30:05.805
Hes the only one who could move
freely through the facility.

30:05.970 --> 30:07.972
He knows it like the back of his hand.

30:24.155 --> 30:27.102
We have all the time in the world.

30:46.511 --> 30:50.653
This, this is Sector 2.

30:52.083 --> 30:56.327
You need a key
to move to the next Sector.

30:56.921 --> 30:59.492
Baumgartner died two years ago.

31:01.426 --> 31:02.530
No.

31:03.127 --> 31:06.370
I see you are well informed.

31:07.332 --> 31:08.777
How do we get the key'?

31:11.569 --> 31:12.980
I have nothing.

31:13.605 --> 31:15.744
I think it's time for the round two.

31:21.145 --> 31:22.055
You know,

31:22.947 --> 31:26.087
she really looks exactly like you, huh'?

31:30.788 --> 31:33.997
Where is the key'?

31:37.128 --> 31:42.544
Alright, I know Where it is,
and no one else,

31:43.268 --> 31:45.270
no one else needs to die,

31:49.641 --> 31:54.641
This facility is over nine hundred
thousand square feet of corridors,

31:57.081 --> 32:02.861
tunnels, all designed to make you
go around in circles without realizing.

32:03.054 --> 32:06.729
You... will never find what you...

32:06.925 --> 32:08.495
you want without me.

32:11.162 --> 32:12.800
That's Why you're coming with us.

32:25.043 --> 32:29.082
Bring me the Project
and you'll be a very rich man.

32:35.553 --> 32:38.932
Nice to see you again, Comrade.

33:07.685 --> 33:08.755
You're late!

33:08.987 --> 33:11.024
My flight was delayed.

33:15.727 --> 33:17.138
Sorry about Carl.

33:19.063 --> 33:20.804
I know the two of you were close.

33:24.068 --> 33:24.978
Bruno!

33:27.238 --> 33:28.410
<i>Yah'?</i>

33:29.173 --> 33:30.743
Did you see his body'?

33:33.678 --> 33:34.679
Yeah.

33:35.046 --> 33:36.650
How did they find him'?

33:37.115 --> 33:38.685
They had eyes on him.

33:40.118 --> 33:43.622
What do you guys think,
that we're the only after this Project?

33:54.332 --> 33:56.107
Okay, plane is waiting, let's go.

33:58.436 --> 33:59.881
I got to go change.

34:26.764 --> 34:28.243
You think he's fucking her'?

34:31.235 --> 34:32.440
Tabeel'?

34:33.404 --> 34:36.681
No, the President of the United States.

34:36.808 --> 34:39.914
- Yeah, Tabel.
- There's no fuckin' way.

34:41.079 --> 34:42.387
He's not.

34:47.251 --> 34:48.355
You know,

34:49.087 --> 34:51.693
shoot San Carlo's wife,
his share of the money.

34:53.024 --> 34:56.369
It would have been right
for you to keep it.

34:58.729 --> 34:59.833
Right.

35:09.240 --> 35:10.344
Right.

35:42.106 --> 35:43.813
The key is inside.

35:51.482 --> 35:52.324
Okay. Oh, oh.

35:58.956 --> 35:59.900
Okay.

36:01.926 --> 36:03.530
He's got nothing around his neck.

36:05.163 --> 36:06.233
There's nothing here.

36:06.831 --> 36:08.037
Where is the damned key'?

36:09.734 --> 36:11.179
I already told you,

36:12.036 --> 36:13.276
it's inside.

36:14.872 --> 36:16.044
Inside?

36:16.607 --> 36:18.177
Inside Where?

36:19.443 --> 36:21.047
Nothing in the pockets.

36:22.413 --> 36:24.484
You don't understand...

36:27.151 --> 36:29.028
it's inside Baumgartner.

36:30.888 --> 36:31.992
Eyuh!

36:36.027 --> 36:37.131
Are you sure'?

36:40.231 --> 36:42.006
Oh, absolutely.

37:00.117 --> 37:02.324
Hey, you don't have to ask me twice.

37:02.453 --> 37:03.898
You want to stick around, huh'?

37:04.121 --> 37:06.328
Yeah, enjoy it.

37:16.801 --> 37:22.752
They used to blindfold us when
we went in and out so we...

37:23.574 --> 37:26.077
we never knew exactly
where we were.

37:28.012 --> 37:33.428
When they decided to ah,
suspend the Project,

37:34.085 --> 37:40.695
the Soviet army decided to ah,
alienate us, bury the bunker.

37:42.393 --> 37:43.736
So we ran.

37:45.963 --> 37:48.102
I took the access codes.

37:48.966 --> 37:53.346
Kentz took the coordinates
and Baumgartner took the ah,

37:54.038 --> 37:56.348
the key to the facility.

37:57.975 --> 38:01.081
What was Henderson's role...
in all this'?

38:01.212 --> 38:06.127
Oh, he ah, he worked
with us on the Project.

38:07.118 --> 38:10.964
One day,
we were informed he was ah,

38:12.957 --> 38:14.163
a plant.

38:14.692 --> 38:19.232
From the United States
and he planned to...

38:20.131 --> 38:22.839
Project 12... what was it about?

38:24.368 --> 38:25.676
Weapons.

38:28.072 --> 38:30.382
That's all we ever cared about.

38:57.435 --> 38:59.195
I'm just going to be
in the back, stretching.

38:59.203 --> 39:00.011
Okay.

39:06.143 --> 39:07.417
Funny...

39:08.913 --> 39:10.085
What is'?

39:11.482 --> 39:14.258
I spent my whole life hiding,

39:14.852 --> 39:17.833
never got a chance
to know my own daughter.

39:21.192 --> 39:22.466
I was really surprised

39:22.560 --> 39:25.097
of the photograph
they took of me with her.

39:26.597 --> 39:27.598
Don't worry.

39:28.432 --> 39:30.139
Nothing will happen to her.

39:31.035 --> 39:32.810
We're not that mean.

39:33.270 --> 39:34.613
To children.

39:40.611 --> 39:42.113
So, what's the difference?

39:44.014 --> 39:45.891
You want to see them grow up.

39:46.317 --> 39:48.490
Stay away from this Project then.

39:53.958 --> 39:55.096
The mission.

39:56.093 --> 39:57.333
I need to piss.

40:01.632 --> 40:03.009
Don't go too far.

40:10.107 --> 40:11.245
What do you think?

40:12.076 --> 40:13.783
I don't like churches.

40:15.513 --> 40:17.049
I'm going to go take a shit.

40:25.823 --> 40:27.928
Ain't much of a house of God, is it'?

40:43.607 --> 40:47.885
Like I said, the Soviets
buried the bunker.

40:55.186 --> 40:58.167
This is the only Way in.

41:22.279 --> 41:23.485
Well,

41:24.148 --> 41:26.890
I hope you can make it down,
old man'?

41:32.056 --> 41:33.160
Get the gear.

41:34.692 --> 41:35.762
Go on!

41:50.641 --> 41:51.642
The key.

42:14.164 --> 42:17.111
I go first, you go second.

42:36.153 --> 42:37.223
It's safe!

42:44.161 --> 42:46.903
Bruno, help Belinovski.

42:48.365 --> 42:50.106
Your turn, old man.

43:03.047 --> 43:05.027
It's down that way.

43:05.883 --> 43:08.557
Well, I'll trust the map for now.

43:11.555 --> 43:14.399
Well, looks like
Balanosvky is right.

43:14.992 --> 43:16.062
Oh yeah?

43:16.360 --> 43:20.035
Well then, guess what,
you can lead the way, little man.

43:44.154 --> 43:48.068
Smells like the inside of
a bush pigs ass down here.

43:48.993 --> 43:53.032
It's been sealed
for the last forty years,

43:54.164 --> 43:55.837
what would you expect?

44:08.245 --> 44:10.657
Wow, huge!

44:11.682 --> 44:13.662
How many people worked here'?

44:14.485 --> 44:15.964
Six hundred.

44:16.520 --> 44:19.524
It was built during
the Second World War

44:20.591 --> 44:22.730
and used during the cold war.

44:23.494 --> 44:25.474
A good old...

44:29.166 --> 44:31.237
Spare us the history lesson.

44:35.105 --> 44:36.049
No what?

44:52.956 --> 44:55.197
Oh, you see this.

44:58.829 --> 45:00.638
They've taken down the signs.

45:00.998 --> 45:02.409
It's like ah,

45:03.000 --> 45:06.880
exploring the New York subway
without a map,

45:07.204 --> 45:08.547
in the dark.

45:10.674 --> 45:13.814
There's a fuse
box three hundred meters down.

45:14.745 --> 45:16.452
Let's hope it still works.

45:53.383 --> 45:55.090
Let there be lights, eh'?

45:55.452 --> 45:58.058
Is there electricity
in the whole bunker'?

45:59.323 --> 46:01.997
Each section was independent.

46:03.160 --> 46:05.003
Well, according to this...

46:05.195 --> 46:07.698
we're near the track entrance.

46:08.532 --> 46:09.772
Well that's down there.

46:12.669 --> 46:13.477
Excuse me.

46:13.637 --> 46:17.949
- Get Walking... Tiny.
- Hey, relax.

46:22.279 --> 46:25.317
You get your nose
any further up his ass...

46:25.516 --> 46:28.053
we'll have to pull
you out by your ankles.

46:29.353 --> 46:31.424
We're going to kill him anyway.

46:35.225 --> 46:36.670
That's up to me.

47:10.427 --> 47:13.601
Fuckin' Russians had
quite a setup, didn't they?

47:14.998 --> 47:16.500
Soviets.

47:39.289 --> 47:40.563
It's dead.

47:43.126 --> 47:44.605
How many exits?

47:45.162 --> 47:47.608
This is the main exit.

47:47.998 --> 47:51.309
There is another exit
three floors down, but ah,

47:51.435 --> 47:54.644
but it's too small for the prototype.

47:56.840 --> 47:58.080
Has to be this one.

48:01.044 --> 48:02.284
No problem.

48:03.113 --> 48:05.889
Why don't you guys
go ahead and I'll help Alan'?

48:06.316 --> 48:07.158
Thanks.

48:07.317 --> 48:08.022
This way.

48:08.585 --> 48:09.655
Okay, go.

48:11.154 --> 48:14.033
So, it faces south...

48:14.091 --> 48:15.331
So, what do we do'?

48:16.693 --> 48:18.730
You go inside and locate the signal.

48:22.599 --> 48:24.010
Got you. I'll be right back.

48:24.334 --> 48:25.540
All right.

48:40.050 --> 48:41.927
What Sector is this'?

48:42.986 --> 48:44.431
Still in Sector two.

48:46.523 --> 48:47.968
The lights are out.

48:48.992 --> 48:50.733
Just about.

49:59.096 --> 50:00.097
Alan.

50:00.931 --> 50:02.569
I've located the entrance.

50:08.839 --> 50:11.410
Oh my God,
it's completely, barren.

50:12.175 --> 50:13.176
COPY-

50:25.989 --> 50:27.366
I'm setting out...

50:27.891 --> 50:28.995
the explosion.

50:59.756 --> 51:03.966
You're lucky, exactly as we left it.

51:05.829 --> 51:06.967
Incredible.

51:09.266 --> 51:12.145
As if time itself has ah, stood still.

51:19.409 --> 51:22.913
What the hell were you doing here'?

51:23.814 --> 51:25.088
You don't want to know.

51:32.389 --> 51:33.561
And this'?

51:34.724 --> 51:36.067
That the Prototype?

51:37.561 --> 51:39.438
No, that's ah...

51:39.629 --> 51:42.132
it never made it past
the testing stage.

51:43.266 --> 51:47.009
Well, where's the one
we're looking for'?

51:47.504 --> 51:48.642
Well,

51:49.172 --> 51:50.947
they may have moved it.

52:39.556 --> 52:41.968
Okay so, we're going
to need explosives to...

52:48.732 --> 52:49.904
What did he say'?

52:51.134 --> 52:53.341
He wants to see our papers.

52:54.004 --> 52:55.244
You're fuckin' kidding me.

53:05.715 --> 53:08.059
That was our last warning.

53:11.188 --> 53:12.963
The Russian is rusty.

53:18.428 --> 53:19.532
What's going on'?

53:20.063 --> 53:22.134
Alan! Irena!

53:23.867 --> 53:25.039
Go to see what's happening?

53:27.003 --> 53:28.778
I'll keep an eye on the little guy.

54:27.797 --> 54:28.969
What the fuck'?

54:39.743 --> 54:40.619
He's dead.

54:40.710 --> 54:42.314
- Are you sure'?
- Yeah!

54:42.646 --> 54:44.523
Tell Bruno to bring Balanosvky here.

54:45.448 --> 54:46.518
Bruno, read me'?

54:47.150 --> 54:48.857
- Was he Wearing a vest'?
- Bruno, are you reading me'?

54:49.119 --> 54:50.063
No.

54:50.487 --> 54:51.693
Bruno come in, Bruno!

54:52.489 --> 54:53.729
Bruno, fuck.

54:54.491 --> 54:56.027
Okay, I'm going to go get him.

54:56.092 --> 54:56.968
Irene...

54:59.963 --> 55:00.964
be careful.

55:07.470 --> 55:09.143
I emptied the chamber,

55:11.675 --> 55:13.245
he just kept walking.

55:17.747 --> 55:18.657
Alan,

55:20.583 --> 55:21.687
Alan!

55:24.888 --> 55:27.334
I shot him in the face
and he kept on walking.

55:59.055 --> 56:00.125
Bruno'?

56:02.325 --> 56:03.463
Bruno, are you here'?

56:14.170 --> 56:15.478
Where did he come from'?

56:19.075 --> 56:20.247
The hatch opened.

56:21.811 --> 56:24.621
You have to find a Way
to get the door open.

56:25.014 --> 56:26.254
We need to hurry up.

56:26.883 --> 56:30.126
We have to find the Prototype
and get the hell out of here.

56:30.553 --> 56:31.930
Sure thing.

56:34.424 --> 56:35.869
- They're gone.
- What?

56:35.959 --> 56:40.237
They're not in the infirmary,
and his radio is not working.

56:42.198 --> 56:43.973
Okay, this guy is not alone;

56:46.569 --> 56:50.073
I'll go find them.
Stick together, okay?

56:53.343 --> 56:54.287
Let's go.

57:08.124 --> 57:11.162
Irina, finish this up,
I'm going outside to set it up.

57:11.594 --> 57:13.699
Okay, check the parameters.

57:14.030 --> 57:14.906
I'll call you when it's ready.

57:15.165 --> 57:16.143
Sounds good.

58:20.196 --> 58:21.300
Bruno!

58:22.832 --> 58:24.175
Bruno, can you hear me'?

58:26.002 --> 58:27.003
Bruno!

58:32.842 --> 58:34.014
I found the door.

58:40.149 --> 58:41.628
I'm setting up explosives.

58:49.125 --> 58:51.731
Outside explosives activated.

58:51.995 --> 58:53.531
I'm going back in.

58:53.963 --> 58:57.001
I repeat, I'm going back in.

59:06.609 --> 59:09.852
Ten seconds to detonation,
I repeat.

59:10.113 --> 59:12.286
Ten seconds to detonation.

59:35.171 --> 59:36.081
Irina!

59:37.373 --> 59:38.545
Irina!

01:00:13.176 --> 01:00:14.086
Hey!

01:01:34.691 --> 01:01:36.170
No...

01:01:36.325 --> 01:01:37.303
HO...

01:01:41.164 --> 01:01:41.801
no...

01:01:43.866 --> 01:01:45.146
Got to get the fuck out of here.

01:01:46.002 --> 01:01:47.379
GO, go!

01:01:48.604 --> 01:01:50.242
We got problems Tabeel...

01:01:50.373 --> 01:01:52.046
There are more soldiers.

01:01:52.208 --> 01:01:54.085
I'll see you at the main chamber.

01:01:57.447 --> 01:01:59.017
I want to know what is happening?

01:01:59.882 --> 01:02:00.883
The army.

01:02:01.718 --> 01:02:03.095
Don't be a smart ass.

01:02:03.986 --> 01:02:05.932
Tell me about your experiment.

01:02:05.988 --> 01:02:06.693
No.

01:02:06.956 --> 01:02:09.266
I don't have time to explain.

01:02:09.392 --> 01:02:09.927
<i>No'?</i>

01:02:09.992 --> 01:02:12.131
And you wouldn't understand anyway.

01:02:12.195 --> 01:02:14.698
Go on, kill me if you Want.

01:02:16.032 --> 01:02:18.444
You'll never get out of here alive,
without me.

01:02:23.172 --> 01:02:24.947
You're going to take me
to those documents.

01:02:25.007 --> 01:02:26.145
Right now!

01:02:27.043 --> 01:02:31.924
- They are friends,
- These people are my friends.

01:02:33.216 --> 01:02:35.492
North Koreans are my friends.

01:02:40.590 --> 01:02:41.591
Now, move!

01:03:50.893 --> 01:03:51.871
What about the door'?

01:03:52.361 --> 01:03:53.738
We left the detonator.

01:03:55.731 --> 01:03:57.938
The body, it's gone.

01:04:03.172 --> 01:04:04.242
Move, go!

01:04:04.373 --> 01:04:05.852
- Go, go, go, go, go!
- Go!

01:04:35.037 --> 01:04:36.141
Where are the documents?

01:04:38.174 --> 01:04:39.084
They're right here.

01:04:51.854 --> 01:04:53.765
You're making a terrible mistake.

01:04:56.292 --> 01:04:58.738
That's the bunker,
where's the Weapons?

01:05:14.944 --> 01:05:16.014
Shit!

01:05:16.245 --> 01:05:19.089
I told you we shot the son-of-a-bitch
and he wouldn't go down.

01:05:27.823 --> 01:05:29.166
We need more weapons.

01:05:30.426 --> 01:05:33.999
In Tangier, I added explosives,

01:05:34.130 --> 01:05:36.007
I still got six in my bag.

01:05:37.166 --> 01:05:40.636
We must get out, there is
the exit on the third floor.

01:05:41.671 --> 01:05:43.878
The question is how do we get there'?

01:06:14.870 --> 01:06:16.406
Holy shit!

01:06:16.572 --> 01:06:18.552
Holy shit!

01:06:18.975 --> 01:06:20.852
Oh, this is my favorite.

01:06:21.043 --> 01:06:23.080
Oh baby, baby, baby.

01:06:24.547 --> 01:06:27.118
You're in the right hands now, baby.

01:06:27.183 --> 01:06:28.856
Who is speaking Russian?

01:06:29.485 --> 01:06:32.295
Hey, hey, God damnit!

01:06:32.989 --> 01:06:34.969
You better run little man,

01:06:35.591 --> 01:06:37.161
I don't need you.

01:07:00.449 --> 01:07:03.020
This bunker has been taken over...

01:07:04.854 --> 01:07:06.356
by Capitalists.

01:07:11.994 --> 01:07:13.200
That voice!

01:07:14.330 --> 01:07:15.775
Henderson.

01:07:17.166 --> 01:07:20.010
He must have followed us
to the bunker.

01:07:21.637 --> 01:07:25.813
These soldiers were designed
to eliminate anyone

01:07:26.042 --> 01:07:30.115
and anything
that endangers this facility.

01:07:30.513 --> 01:07:32.424
Do you understand me'?

01:07:42.591 --> 01:07:46.664
The documents you have stolen
will never leave here without me.

01:07:57.173 --> 01:07:58.447
On the thirty-one point six

01:07:58.607 --> 01:08:01.645
of the Soviet
military code has been violated.

01:08:02.011 --> 01:08:05.686
The intruders have stolen Project 12.

01:08:06.248 --> 01:08:09.457
Prepare for battle.

01:08:19.995 --> 01:08:23.966
Exterminate the enemy,
and recover those documents.

01:08:30.305 --> 01:08:31.410
Bruno!

01:08:31.573 --> 01:08:32.348
Bruno!

01:08:34.076 --> 01:08:35.316
Where are you, copy?

01:08:37.011 --> 01:08:38.423
Guys, Where the hell are we'?

01:08:39.148 --> 01:08:40.421
In a fucking maze.

01:08:40.716 --> 01:08:41.854
Just keep going.

01:08:41.951 --> 01:08:44.955
- Okay, go, go!
- Go, go, go, go!

01:09:02.470 --> 01:09:06.145
Intruders, located in Sector three.

01:09:08.477 --> 01:09:10.046
Get them out, get them out!

01:09:17.386 --> 01:09:18.660
More soldiers on the right.

01:09:25.694 --> 01:09:26.968
We're surrounded.

01:09:28.029 --> 01:09:29.008
Here.

01:09:39.175 --> 01:09:40.415
What the hell are those things?

01:09:40.609 --> 01:09:41.781
Are you helping them'?

01:09:42.044 --> 01:09:43.488
We need to help each other, huh'?

01:09:43.612 --> 01:09:45.023
Your friend has the documents.

01:09:45.113 --> 01:09:47.924
If he escapes from this bunker,
he sells them to North Korea.

01:09:48.082 --> 01:09:49.153
Son-of-a-bitch!

01:09:49.752 --> 01:09:52.426
He was an agent,
just like Henderson.

01:09:52.488 --> 01:09:53.728
I never liked him.

01:09:54.390 --> 01:09:56.199
Now you seen the Project, so...

01:09:57.193 --> 01:09:58.297
Are they human'?

01:09:59.962 --> 01:10:00.906
Partly.

01:10:03.465 --> 01:10:06.810
To kill them, you need to,
you need to burn them,

01:10:06.936 --> 01:10:08.973
you need to chop them to pieces.

01:10:09.505 --> 01:10:10.745
You'll need weapons.

01:10:12.074 --> 01:10:12.745
Look out.

01:10:38.601 --> 01:10:41.878
He's heading for the main exit,
I want those documents.

01:10:42.104 --> 01:10:42.946
No problem sir.

01:10:43.072 --> 01:10:44.472
Come on, guys.
Let's go, move, move!

01:10:45.641 --> 01:10:46.619
Bitch.

01:11:32.721 --> 01:11:34.132
You know What,

01:11:35.024 --> 01:11:36.970
you can't shoot for shit.

01:12:08.190 --> 01:12:09.965
You gentlemen got a light?

01:12:13.796 --> 01:12:14.831
Go, go, go-

01:12:24.039 --> 01:12:25.017
Guess you do.

01:12:53.936 --> 01:12:55.074
It's a dead end.

01:12:56.905 --> 01:12:59.505
What the fuck do we do now'?
We can't go back there, it's suicide.

01:12:59.641 --> 01:13:01.052
Bring me the file;

01:13:01.276 --> 01:13:03.119
I'll get you out of here alive, huh'?

01:13:09.485 --> 01:13:11.487
Well, what about Henderson?

01:13:12.154 --> 01:13:13.633
I'll take care of Henderson.

01:13:15.991 --> 01:13:18.192
How much explosives are
you going to leave by the door'?

01:13:20.562 --> 01:13:21.734
Plenty.

01:13:43.152 --> 01:13:44.153
Wait!

01:13:45.387 --> 01:13:47.060
- You know what to do'?
- Yes.

01:13:50.893 --> 01:13:52.201
Good luck!

01:13:57.433 --> 01:13:58.343
Go!

01:14:24.993 --> 01:14:26.370
It's over, Rudolph.

01:14:36.872 --> 01:14:41.321
You're still a romantic;
That was always your mistake.

01:14:43.145 --> 01:14:45.819
My mistake was allowing
my medical research

01:14:46.014 --> 01:14:47.823
to be used for military purposes.

01:14:47.950 --> 01:14:49.429
But you did!

01:14:51.453 --> 01:14:53.558
Your vanity got the best of you.

01:14:54.423 --> 01:14:59.270
Look man, illness
is a billion dollar business.

01:14:59.761 --> 01:15:02.833
There's not enough room in the world
for everyone Balanosvky.

01:15:02.998 --> 01:15:04.978
There's no room for the weak.

01:15:08.270 --> 01:15:14.448
If they get out of here no one
in the world would be safe.

01:15:18.947 --> 01:15:21.052
So, take me to Project 12.

01:16:06.428 --> 01:16:07.634
We have to go down.

01:16:18.206 --> 01:16:19.378
Oh man.

01:16:24.947 --> 01:16:26.585
After you, pal.

01:17:23.271 --> 01:17:24.409
Oh, shit.

01:17:38.787 --> 01:17:40.289
Hey, Tabeel!

01:17:47.562 --> 01:17:50.008
You want to come out here and play'?

01:18:41.550 --> 01:18:43.086
Hey Tabeel!

01:18:45.253 --> 01:18:48.666
I didn't know I'd be hunting
a scared little rabbit.

01:19:24.626 --> 01:19:26.003
You did it.

01:19:28.964 --> 01:19:30.739
He was never tested,

01:19:31.733 --> 01:19:32.973
Let him out.

01:19:33.468 --> 01:19:34.538
Let him out.

01:20:25.253 --> 01:20:28.097
You look like an Indian woman.

01:20:30.592 --> 01:20:33.004
Or a funny old man.

01:20:37.365 --> 01:20:38.969
Look it boy.

01:20:40.068 --> 01:20:41.445
Don't you want to play'?

01:20:43.471 --> 01:20:47.180
Actually, at my age,
it's easier if I just shoot you.

01:20:50.111 --> 01:20:53.024
Are you sure you don't want
to have some fun with me'?

01:21:14.536 --> 01:21:19.781
If you think getting your
ass kicked is going to be fun'?

01:21:21.076 --> 01:21:22.111
Why not?

01:21:23.712 --> 01:21:26.056
That's what I wanted to hear.

01:21:54.109 --> 01:21:55.713
Look what you did to my shirt.

01:22:10.025 --> 01:22:11.368
That hurt.

01:22:11.559 --> 01:22:12.970
Okay.

01:23:06.014 --> 01:23:07.493
You don't look pretty anymore, huh'?

01:23:08.984 --> 01:23:10.258
Are we related?

01:23:11.152 --> 01:23:12.859
Cause you hit like my sister.

01:23:22.964 --> 01:23:24.739
Come on tough guy, come on.

01:23:25.400 --> 01:23:26.242
Watch it!

01:23:27.869 --> 01:23:28.847
Come on.

01:24:05.006 --> 01:24:07.816
You know, you could have shown up
a couple of minutes earlier.

01:24:19.120 --> 01:24:20.895
They call this...

01:24:25.527 --> 01:24:27.507
a hard good-bye.

01:24:29.597 --> 01:24:30.507
Goddamn it.

01:24:31.199 --> 01:24:32.507
GO, go!

01:25:01.362 --> 01:25:03.171
Identify yourself.

01:25:04.599 --> 01:25:06.636
Zero, zero twelve.

01:25:07.202 --> 01:25:09.273
Order immediate formation.

01:25:10.071 --> 01:25:12.745
Sector two, Area one.

01:25:13.308 --> 01:25:16.653
No, that order must not be executed.

01:25:23.084 --> 01:25:24.927
Capitalist!

01:25:29.824 --> 01:25:32.998
No, no, no, no!

01:26:23.411 --> 01:26:24.515
Bingo!

01:26:25.446 --> 01:26:28.046
Looks like we're not the only ones
who know their way out of here.

01:26:29.317 --> 01:26:30.694
What are you waiting for'?

01:26:31.386 --> 01:26:32.296
Hey.

01:26:33.955 --> 01:26:35.059
Tell me something.

01:26:35.924 --> 01:26:37.403
Did you fuck him'?

01:26:41.029 --> 01:26:42.736
Wouldn't you like to know?

01:26:47.635 --> 01:26:49.137
Ladies first.

01:27:11.826 --> 01:27:13.066
Oh shit!

01:27:18.433 --> 01:27:19.605
Where is the girl'?

01:27:20.435 --> 01:27:21.778
With Bruno,

01:27:22.437 --> 01:27:24.644
she was Working with him
the whole time.

01:27:26.608 --> 01:27:28.144
Woman, huh'?

01:27:28.509 --> 01:27:30.455
Give me the documents.

01:27:33.681 --> 01:27:34.785
I don't have them.

01:27:35.950 --> 01:27:36.826
What?

01:27:43.391 --> 01:27:44.961
We have a problem,

01:27:53.034 --> 01:27:56.243
This is the exit on the third floor.

01:27:56.838 --> 01:28:00.786
This is a short out;
It's the only Way out.

01:28:01.442 --> 01:28:04.286
You must find the documents;
Destroy them,

01:28:04.712 --> 01:28:06.817
we'll never have another chance.

01:28:08.916 --> 01:28:09.894
I have a daughter,

01:28:10.585 --> 01:28:12.292
and I want to see her
grow up, you know.

01:28:13.655 --> 01:28:15.726
I wish you all the luck in the world.

01:28:25.433 --> 01:28:26.537
You.

01:28:27.935 --> 01:28:29.744
Watch your back, okay?

01:28:31.039 --> 01:28:32.575
I always do brother.

01:28:34.509 --> 01:28:38.116
So, you are my bodyguard
again, huh'?

01:29:12.847 --> 01:29:17.159
If I don't make it,
you'll have to do it.

01:29:19.253 --> 01:29:20.857
That's Why I'm here.

01:29:50.351 --> 01:29:52.024
Soldiers, stand down.

01:29:52.353 --> 01:29:54.128
Right, ladies.

01:29:58.893 --> 01:30:04.502
You, we are creators,
to surpass mankind,

01:30:06.234 --> 01:30:10.808
designs to survive anything,

01:30:12.006 --> 01:30:14.953
but incapable of reason.

01:30:25.787 --> 01:30:31.066
The created
must not surpass the creator.

01:30:43.070 --> 01:30:44.743
Don't do it, Colonel.

01:30:46.507 --> 01:30:49.716
The creation has surpassed
the creator.

01:30:50.511 --> 01:30:52.821
The system can't cope.

01:30:54.148 --> 01:30:57.152
The human race must be eliminated.

01:31:01.088 --> 01:31:05.764
One look through the eyes
of a single man.

01:31:06.994 --> 01:31:08.769
Kill the Colonel.
