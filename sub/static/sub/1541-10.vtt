00:01.845 --> 00:03.453
Previously
on "The Vampire Diaries"...

00:03.454 --> 00:05.564
- What about Bonnie?
- She sacrificed herself

00:05.566 --> 00:07.333
so I could come back.
She's all alone

00:07.334 --> 00:09.182
I'm sorry I compelled
away the memories.

00:09.183 --> 00:11.018
We'll make new ones.

00:11.019 --> 00:13.165
I hate you for ruining
our friendship,

00:13.166 --> 00:14.888
and I think
that I deserve better than that.

00:14.889 --> 00:17.042
Enzo, let her
go, or I swear...

00:17.043 --> 00:18.651
No!

00:18.925 --> 00:20.587
How do you feel
about being a hunter again?

00:20.588 --> 00:21.493
Why?

00:21.494 --> 00:23.429
Because I want you
to help me kill Enzo.

00:23.431 --> 00:26.156
- Get the ascendant from Jo.
- I understand.

00:26.157 --> 00:27.433
Damon is a vampire.

00:27.435 --> 00:29.127
Are you saying
Damon compelled me?

00:29.128 --> 00:30.903
He wouldn't do that.
He's my friend.

00:30.905 --> 00:32.805
Jo drove me across the border.

00:32.807 --> 00:34.144
Look, Ric.

00:35.552 --> 00:37.443
My coven put
Kai in a prison world.

00:37.444 --> 00:40.255
- Kai?
- As in our brother, my twin.

00:40.256 --> 00:43.449
In our coven's tradition,
the twins merge their strength.

00:43.450 --> 00:46.652
The stronger one wins, absorbing
their twin's power.

00:46.653 --> 00:49.340
- The weaker one dies.
- I'm not gonna let you die.

00:49.341 --> 00:50.417
Kai is here.

00:50.418 --> 00:52.558
I guess this is that,
uh, antimagic border,

00:52.559 --> 00:55.358
which means now there's
a psycho loose in Mystic Falls

00:55.359 --> 00:57.395
and no vampires around
to stop him.

01:00.801 --> 01:02.067
What the hell do you want?

01:02.069 --> 01:04.001
Feel like making
a deal with the devil?

01:10.277 --> 01:11.877
How much are you gonna
want to kill me

01:11.878 --> 01:14.713
- if I need to rain check tonight?
- What happened?

01:14.714 --> 01:16.549
I have a possible 480
hit-and-run on campus,

01:16.550 --> 01:19.269
one DOA, 4 reds en route.

01:19.853 --> 01:21.620
Have your previous
boyfriends understood

01:21.621 --> 01:23.122
this language you speak?

01:23.123 --> 01:24.857
I'm gonna miss dinner

01:24.858 --> 01:26.991
so you're my boyfriend now?

01:29.595 --> 01:32.532
There's no hospital code
for awkward silence.

01:32.966 --> 01:34.767
Give me two hours.
Save me dinner.

01:34.768 --> 01:36.001
Doctor, we have
a young female

01:36.002 --> 01:37.503
with abdominal wounds.

01:37.504 --> 01:39.671
Put her in t3.
I need 10 milligrams of morphine.

01:39.672 --> 01:40.973
Mine's conscious.

01:40.974 --> 01:42.274
See a lot of blood,
no broken bones.

01:42.275 --> 01:43.876
Making any sense to you?

01:43.877 --> 01:45.644
No, it's not.
What happened to you?

01:45.645 --> 01:47.279
Were you hit by a car?

01:47.280 --> 01:50.883
I can't breathe.

01:50.884 --> 01:53.252
It's ok. You can tell me
what really happened.

01:53.253 --> 01:55.153
Sweetheart?

01:55.154 --> 01:56.388
Look at me.

02:01.093 --> 02:03.694
What happened to you?

02:03.695 --> 02:05.366
Aah!

02:05.367 --> 02:06.620
I stabbed her.

02:06.621 --> 02:09.467
Aah! Aah!

02:25.984 --> 02:27.484
Unh!

02:29.821 --> 02:33.124
Sorry. Had to.

02:33.125 --> 02:36.928
You know you just
declared war, right?

02:36.929 --> 02:39.766
Come on.
Caroline's over there.

02:43.267 --> 02:44.801
Aah!

02:51.142 --> 02:52.609
Come on.

03:03.087 --> 03:06.390
Heh. Nope.
I'm not noticing you.

03:06.391 --> 03:09.193
Today's not may 10, 1994.

03:09.194 --> 03:10.828
Today's the tree decorating
ceremony,

03:10.829 --> 03:15.466
and you are not
telling me otherwise.

03:15.467 --> 03:18.002
I just figured that we were
skipping Christmas this year,

03:18.003 --> 03:19.804
you know, considering
the part where I die

03:19.805 --> 03:22.422
if I cross the border
into my hometown.

03:22.423 --> 03:25.006
What happened to Christmas being
your favorite time of the year?

03:25.007 --> 03:27.270
Was my favorite time of year

03:27.271 --> 03:29.380
when I could actually
live in my own house

03:29.381 --> 03:30.814
and help decorate the town tree

03:30.815 --> 03:33.349
and drink hot cocoa
with my friends.

03:36.654 --> 03:38.756
What are you doing?

03:38.757 --> 03:41.358
You're supposed to be at the Mystic Falls
tree decorating ceremony.

03:41.359 --> 03:43.127
I'm playing hooky this year.

03:43.128 --> 03:45.029
I figure just because you can't
come home for the holidays

03:45.030 --> 03:47.350
doesn't mean the holidays
can't come to you.

03:48.466 --> 03:50.334
You even brought
our favorite ornaments.

03:50.335 --> 03:52.036
Mom!

03:52.037 --> 03:53.837
Hey. I, uh, didn't
know which ones to get,

03:53.838 --> 03:55.205
so I got both.

03:55.206 --> 03:57.040
What are you doing here?

03:57.041 --> 04:00.377
Your mom needed
Christmas lights.

04:00.378 --> 04:01.879
You have a huge dorm,

04:01.880 --> 04:04.547
and I thought we could
use an extra set of hands.

04:10.387 --> 04:12.303
The little ones obviously.

04:22.999 --> 04:24.735
Are you watching me sleep?

04:24.736 --> 04:27.771
No. I'm watching you drool
all over Ric's textbooks,

04:27.772 --> 04:30.574
and considering you're
already on his bad side...

04:30.575 --> 04:32.876
I don't drool.

04:32.877 --> 04:34.506
Hmm.

04:37.270 --> 04:39.600
Ohh. What time is it?

04:42.659 --> 04:44.852
Time for Ric to get
a new reference library.

04:44.853 --> 04:46.467
We've been looking all night.

04:46.468 --> 04:49.125
I swear I haven't found anything
that even remotely resembles

04:49.126 --> 04:50.694
an ascendant.

04:50.695 --> 04:54.397
Well, we haven't
looked hard enough.

04:54.398 --> 04:55.798
Let's get to it.

05:01.345 --> 05:04.298
- Find anything yet?
- Nope.

05:08.845 --> 05:10.812
Still staring.

05:12.918 --> 05:14.884
It's just...

05:14.885 --> 05:17.373
Everything you've been
doing for Bonnie.

05:19.425 --> 05:20.957
Thank you.

05:21.356 --> 05:23.169
She'd do it for us.

05:28.893 --> 05:30.066
Hello, Ric.

05:30.067 --> 05:32.791
- Have you seen Jo?
- No, not since yesterday.

05:34.271 --> 05:35.404
Why?

05:35.405 --> 05:37.206
So I asked around the hospital.

05:37.207 --> 05:39.741
No one's seen Jo since
last night at the er.

05:39.743 --> 05:41.077
A bunch of stab victims came in,

05:41.078 --> 05:43.613
and one of them's
missing, as well.

05:43.614 --> 05:45.014
It was Kai.

05:45.851 --> 05:48.217
Jo knew he'd come after her,
and he did.

05:48.218 --> 05:50.553
Not to give you
boyfriend lessons or anything,

05:50.554 --> 05:53.289
but if you knew Jo's whackjob
brother was out on the loose

05:53.290 --> 05:55.591
and after her, don't you think
that keeping an eye on her

05:55.592 --> 05:56.859
would have been a smart move?

05:56.860 --> 05:58.427
And what would you have
had me do, Damon,

05:58.428 --> 06:00.990
ask you to compel Jo
to stay put?

06:00.991 --> 06:03.538
Guys, if Kai has Jo,
we need a plan.

06:03.539 --> 06:07.203
Plan's easy.
Find Kai, fftt, kill Kai. Mm-hmm.

06:07.204 --> 06:08.938
Bottom line, we need
to keep Kai alive.

06:08.939 --> 06:10.973
You think I'm gonna
protect the guy

06:10.974 --> 06:12.641
who chased us around the house

06:12.642 --> 06:14.076
with a baseball bat
when we were 4?

06:14.077 --> 06:15.444
Luke's right, Tyler.

06:15.445 --> 06:17.680
You're on some serious crack.

06:17.681 --> 06:18.881
Right now, you two
are stuck doing

06:18.882 --> 06:20.182
the twin-merge
for your coven, ok?

06:20.183 --> 06:22.651
That means one lives, one dies,

06:22.652 --> 06:25.054
but if we help Kai and he finds
a way to merge with Jo,

06:25.055 --> 06:26.488
it's not your problem anymore.

06:26.489 --> 06:28.624
Until Kai becomes
the most powerful witch

06:28.625 --> 06:30.492
in our coven and goes
on a killing spree.

06:30.493 --> 06:34.463
Something tells me that's
gonna become our problem.

06:34.464 --> 06:37.711
What does he want us
to do exactly?

06:37.712 --> 06:39.658
Just think sociopathic
Ryan Reynolds.

06:39.659 --> 06:40.736
Haven't seen him.

06:40.737 --> 06:42.337
Grunge vibe, annoying as hell.

06:42.338 --> 06:43.505
Still no idea.

06:43.506 --> 06:45.207
Well, if he has half a brain,

06:45.208 --> 06:46.575
he will be hiding where
vampires can't find him.

06:46.576 --> 06:48.644
So in between levels
of Mario Kart,

06:48.645 --> 06:51.060
can you and little baby
Gilbert maybe keep an eye out?

06:51.061 --> 06:53.360
Yeah, got it.
If we see him, we'll let you know.

06:54.517 --> 06:55.717
Who was that?

06:55.718 --> 06:57.319
It was Damon.
Apparently, there's

06:57.320 --> 06:59.346
a psychopath
roaming Mystic Falls.

06:59.347 --> 07:00.756
You tell him we're busy
hunting down a psychopath

07:00.757 --> 07:02.857
roaming outside Mystic Falls?

07:02.859 --> 07:05.201
Must have forgot to mention it.

07:06.180 --> 07:07.395
Look. You better
get out of here.

07:07.929 --> 07:09.898
Enzo's gonna be here soon.

07:09.899 --> 07:11.499
Let's kill a vampire.

07:15.291 --> 07:17.873
Well, Bevis and Butthead
are on the lookout.

07:17.874 --> 07:19.608
Anyone else brimming
with confidence?

07:19.609 --> 07:21.042
I mean, this just
doesn't make sense.

07:21.043 --> 07:22.811
What could possibly
not make sense

07:22.812 --> 07:25.547
about magical twins
absorbing into one another.

07:25.548 --> 07:27.248
Listen. Jo needs her magic
for the merge to work, ok,

07:27.249 --> 07:30.051
and she got rid
of that back in 1994.

07:30.052 --> 07:32.854
Kai said Jo hid her magic
in a knife somewhere.

07:32.855 --> 07:35.889
It's probably back in Portland,
where she got rid of it in 1994.

07:36.425 --> 07:38.526
He checked.
The knife's not there.

07:38.527 --> 07:40.428
He thinks someone took it.

07:40.429 --> 07:41.830
Jo doesn't have magic because
it's stuffed in a knife

07:41.831 --> 07:44.361
that was stolen
and hidden by yours truly.

07:44.362 --> 07:45.400
Kai won't find it.

07:45.401 --> 07:46.935
Yeah, unless Kai does
a locator spell.

07:46.936 --> 07:48.953
- It's impossible.
- Why?

07:48.954 --> 07:51.539
Kai was born without
the ability to do magic.

07:51.540 --> 07:53.441
Let me guess.
Kai wants us to do

07:53.442 --> 07:55.810
a locator spell on the knife.

07:55.811 --> 07:58.832
If we find it,
Jo can get her magic back,

07:58.833 --> 08:01.072
Kai can merge with her,
and you and Luke live.

08:01.073 --> 08:02.784
This is ridiculous.

08:02.785 --> 08:05.153
This is our job.

08:05.154 --> 08:06.788
Merging is our duty
to the coven.

08:06.789 --> 08:08.389
It's why we were born.

08:08.390 --> 08:10.158
No. We were born
because our coven decided

08:10.159 --> 08:12.627
that Jo wasn't strong
enough to beat Kai.

08:12.628 --> 08:14.328
Why should we have to die
because our sister's

08:14.329 --> 08:16.769
too weak to defeat
our psychopath of a brother?

08:17.499 --> 08:19.167
You know, a month ago,
the thought of bowing out

08:19.168 --> 08:20.801
never even occurred to you.

08:20.802 --> 08:23.671
That's because Kai
wasn't here a month ago,

08:23.672 --> 08:24.897
but he's here now.

08:26.195 --> 08:29.577
Luke, we don't have to do this.

08:29.578 --> 08:32.908
We have a chance to live
out normal, human lives.

08:33.629 --> 08:35.916
We could actually be happy.

08:35.917 --> 08:37.985
If the only way to
restore Jo's magic

08:37.986 --> 08:39.986
is to reunite her
with that knife,

08:39.988 --> 08:41.688
Kai's gonna come for it.

08:41.690 --> 08:42.804
Ric's right.

08:43.315 --> 08:45.292
Even if Kai can't
do the locator spell,

08:45.293 --> 08:47.094
he's gonna make it
his mission to find it.

08:47.095 --> 08:49.663
Kai finds it. Great.
Love it.

08:49.664 --> 08:51.368
Why aren't you more concerned?

08:51.369 --> 08:53.667
Because if Kai
goes for the knife,

08:53.668 --> 08:56.637
I will kill him
because the knife

08:56.638 --> 09:00.007
is right here where I hid it.

09:00.008 --> 09:02.208
Ta-da!

09:06.013 --> 09:09.016
I know I tried to
kill you when you were toddlers,

09:09.017 --> 09:10.594
but I got to say,

09:12.636 --> 09:15.888
it sure is nice to be
around family for the holidays.

09:34.011 --> 09:35.780
Dad's not here yet.

09:35.781 --> 09:37.081
Oh, yeah.
You know what?

09:37.082 --> 09:38.516
He's not gonna make it.

09:38.517 --> 09:40.718
You remember his friend Steven?

09:40.719 --> 09:42.720
He needed help moving
a couch or something,

09:42.721 --> 09:44.621
so he's gonna miss out.

09:44.623 --> 09:46.824
But it's an undeclared law
that the sheriff and her husband

09:46.825 --> 09:48.359
put the star on the tree.

09:48.360 --> 09:49.694
Then we will just have to
let the Lockwoods

09:49.695 --> 09:51.695
have the honors this year.

09:51.696 --> 09:53.864
Is something going on
between you two?

09:53.865 --> 09:56.700
It'll be fine, I promise.

09:56.701 --> 09:59.203
Mom, I'm a freshman
in High School, ok?

09:59.204 --> 10:00.838
I can handle
adult conversations.

10:00.839 --> 10:03.841
No worrying
during the holidays, ok?

10:03.842 --> 10:06.010
And that tree is not
gonna decorate itself.

10:06.011 --> 10:07.510
Go.

10:11.148 --> 10:13.784
Well, maybe you'll
meet a cute surfer.

10:13.785 --> 10:17.987
Doubtful. My dad's conference is
two hours away from any beach.

10:17.989 --> 10:20.491
Ahh! Cute surfer?
Where?

10:20.492 --> 10:23.660
Nowhere. Bonnie's dad is
dragging her on a work trip,

10:23.661 --> 10:25.828
so I'm gonna ask
my parents if she can spend

10:25.830 --> 10:27.097
the holiday with us.

10:27.098 --> 10:28.298
Are you serious?

10:28.299 --> 10:31.431
Yeah. The 3 of us have
never spent Christmas apart.

10:31.597 --> 10:34.404
I plan on keeping it that way,
even though Jeremy will hate it.

10:34.405 --> 10:35.606
It's always fun to torture him.

10:35.607 --> 10:38.041
Mm-hmm. Oh!
I love you.

10:38.042 --> 10:40.944
Almost as much as I love
torturing Jeremy.

10:40.945 --> 10:43.413
Ok, great! Now that
Christmas is saved,

10:43.414 --> 10:45.082
let's get these garlands
on the tree

10:45.083 --> 10:47.116
before they end up on your hips.

10:56.260 --> 10:59.729
Here. I got it.

10:59.730 --> 11:01.231
What are you doing here?

11:01.232 --> 11:03.536
Well, your mom asked
for my help.

11:03.537 --> 11:07.203
No, Stefan. What
are you doing here?

11:07.205 --> 11:09.272
Because if you think hanging
a few stands of light is gonna

11:09.273 --> 11:11.876
make me forget what
a crappy friend you've been,

11:11.877 --> 11:13.810
then you thought wrong.

11:13.811 --> 11:17.580
- Caroline, I'm trying, ok?
- You're trying?

11:17.982 --> 11:20.917
No. This is the easy part, ok?

11:20.918 --> 11:22.719
We're hanging Christmas lights.

11:22.720 --> 11:26.022
Anyone can be friends when
you're hanging Christmas lights.

11:26.023 --> 11:27.723
Who wants hot chocolate?

11:27.725 --> 11:30.293
I was just leaving.

11:35.598 --> 11:37.934
Mom?!

11:37.935 --> 11:42.038
Oh, wow. I just got really...

11:42.039 --> 11:44.707
Mom!

11:44.708 --> 11:46.541
You ok?

11:50.079 --> 11:52.048
What the hell is he doing?

11:52.049 --> 11:54.350
Probably playing
tic-tac-toe with himself

11:54.351 --> 11:56.586
like a crazy person.

11:56.587 --> 11:58.520
This is the antimagic border.

11:58.522 --> 12:00.223
Jo can get her magic
back over there

12:00.224 --> 12:03.025
while over here...

12:03.026 --> 12:06.028
Hey. What did you do to me?

12:06.029 --> 12:07.462
Sissy's up.

12:14.437 --> 12:16.372
What the hell did you do to me?

12:16.373 --> 12:17.673
I haven't seen you in 18 years.

12:17.674 --> 12:19.308
You can't muster a hello?

12:19.309 --> 12:20.943
What did you guys do?

12:20.944 --> 12:23.145
What you should have
done 18 years ago.

12:23.146 --> 12:25.848
It's not gonna work Kai.
I don't have my...

12:25.849 --> 12:27.983
Magic. Yeah.
Yeah. I recall.

12:27.984 --> 12:31.153
You stored it in this.

12:31.154 --> 12:32.354
Aah!

12:32.355 --> 12:33.823
What the hell?

12:33.824 --> 12:35.024
Ohh!

12:35.025 --> 12:36.759
I'm trying to
reunite Jo with her...

12:36.760 --> 12:38.027
Aah!

12:38.028 --> 12:39.427
Magic.

12:44.266 --> 12:45.400
It's not working.

12:45.402 --> 12:47.535
Enough, enough, man.

12:50.306 --> 12:51.807
I was wanting to kill you

12:51.808 --> 12:55.044
when your brain was
the size of an acorn.

12:55.045 --> 12:57.278
You don't think I'll do it now?

12:59.515 --> 13:03.352
Whatever.
I'm not watching this.

13:03.353 --> 13:05.872
Ha ha ha!

13:07.457 --> 13:10.324
Oh, so dramatic.

13:11.961 --> 13:13.428
All right.

13:13.429 --> 13:15.365
Sissy...

13:16.232 --> 13:17.398
Let's try this again.

13:17.400 --> 13:20.936
Stop. I put my magic
in there by choice.

13:20.937 --> 13:24.027
Taking it back is also my choice

13:24.028 --> 13:27.009
unless I bleed to death,

13:27.010 --> 13:29.411
which will happen in
the next 30 minutes.

13:29.412 --> 13:32.681
Heh. Wouldn't it be ironic

13:32.682 --> 13:36.083
if you accidentally killed
me before the merge ceremony?

13:48.029 --> 13:50.899
I'm going to find a bandage

13:50.900 --> 13:53.435
while you figure out how to
put the magic in this knife

13:53.436 --> 13:55.469
into our sister.

14:01.910 --> 14:04.412
Preferably by the time
I get back

14:04.413 --> 14:07.181
so I don't have to dull it
by slitting your throat.

14:16.125 --> 14:17.926
- Hey!
- Hey.

14:17.927 --> 14:19.127
What happened?

14:19.128 --> 14:20.795
I don't know.
She just collapsed.

14:20.796 --> 14:22.297
One second, we're decorating,

14:22.298 --> 14:24.632
and then the next,
she's just on the ground.

14:24.633 --> 14:26.634
Maybe she forgot to eat.

14:26.635 --> 14:28.101
You know, sometimes,
she skips breakfast.

14:28.103 --> 14:30.538
And when was the last
time you ate, Caroline,

14:30.539 --> 14:32.273
as in fed?

14:32.274 --> 14:34.876
Oh, God. Now you
sound like Stefan.

14:34.877 --> 14:39.914
He just went to go find
something to take the edge off.

14:39.915 --> 14:42.116
Heh. They have her sedated.

14:42.117 --> 14:44.185
She's going to be
asleep for a while.

14:44.186 --> 14:49.123
Can you just come
and distract me?

14:49.124 --> 14:52.160
How's the search for
the new ascendant thingy?

14:52.161 --> 14:53.694
Not good.

14:53.695 --> 14:57.265
Damon and I spent
the night researching.

14:57.266 --> 14:59.166
God. Poor Bonnie.

14:59.167 --> 15:01.502
Do you think she knows
it's Christmas?

15:01.503 --> 15:04.305
You know she never liked being
away from us at Christmas.

15:04.306 --> 15:07.007
I don't know.

15:07.008 --> 15:10.411
It's probably better
that she doesn't know, though.

15:10.412 --> 15:11.612
So are you and Damon...

15:11.613 --> 15:13.147
I know what you're thinking,

15:13.148 --> 15:15.349
and no.

15:15.350 --> 15:18.119
Actually, I was going to
say that I think

15:18.120 --> 15:22.323
it's great how he's always been
there for you when it mattered,

15:22.324 --> 15:23.891
you know, through
thick and thin,

15:23.892 --> 15:26.293
good times and bad times.

15:26.294 --> 15:29.730
Maybe I haven't given
him enough credit.

15:29.731 --> 15:32.131
You're clearly malnourished.

15:34.034 --> 15:35.869
Bet you think you're
pretty clever, don't you?

15:35.870 --> 15:37.571
Is this Damon?

15:37.572 --> 15:38.839
Why don't I have
your number saved?

15:38.840 --> 15:40.508
Well, you weren't
in your dorm room,

15:40.509 --> 15:43.110
and your pouty little
goth friend wasn't in hers.

15:43.111 --> 15:44.378
It's creepy you know
where Liv's dorm room is.

15:44.379 --> 15:46.347
Let me guess.
You 3 idiots figured

15:46.348 --> 15:48.215
that Kai merging with Jo
benefits you and Liv.

15:48.216 --> 15:51.452
Now I'm not sure exactly
how Luke fits into that yet,

15:51.453 --> 15:52.786
but I'll use my imagination.

15:52.787 --> 15:54.622
I'm trying to keep
my girlfriend alive.

15:54.623 --> 15:56.665
Sound familiar?

16:02.029 --> 16:04.465
We both knew that
wasn't gonna work.

16:04.466 --> 16:06.333
Where's Jo?

16:06.334 --> 16:07.835
I'm not telling you,

16:07.836 --> 16:10.304
and before you threaten
to rip my head off,

16:10.305 --> 16:13.307
remember, all that
does is guarantee

16:13.308 --> 16:16.243
Kai having to merge with Jo.

16:16.244 --> 16:18.111
Is that what
you people think of me,

16:18.112 --> 16:20.214
that I just instantly
resort to violence?

16:20.215 --> 16:21.782
I just have a question.
I mean, look.

16:21.783 --> 16:23.450
I get why you don't want
to merge with Liv, ok,

16:23.451 --> 16:25.886
because no one wants to
see that face with her hair.

16:25.887 --> 16:28.288
I get it,
but what makes you think

16:28.289 --> 16:30.490
Kai merging with Jo
is any smarter?

16:30.491 --> 16:32.092
I mean, I heard he killed
4 of your siblings,

16:32.093 --> 16:34.594
and that was without magic.

16:34.595 --> 16:36.430
Eh, it'll be fine.
I'm sure when Kai gets

16:36.431 --> 16:39.748
all that power he's just
gonna mellow right on out.

16:40.885 --> 16:42.882
Heh.

16:43.671 --> 16:45.171
Stop.

16:52.979 --> 16:55.916
And here I thought we were
meeting for tea and crumpets.

16:55.917 --> 16:57.617
I'm giving you
information about a girl

16:57.618 --> 16:59.185
who's supposed to be
Stefan's long lost niece.

16:59.186 --> 17:01.121
I'm not exactly interested
in him finding out.

17:01.122 --> 17:02.889
And why are you helping me?

17:02.890 --> 17:04.691
I thought you unfriended me

17:04.692 --> 17:06.326
when I killed
that little con artist.

17:06.327 --> 17:08.994
Monique. Her name was Monique.

17:08.996 --> 17:10.329
Eh, two names actually...

17:10.330 --> 17:13.366
First Sarah, then Monique,
probably others.

17:13.367 --> 17:15.135
I asked you why
you're helping me.

17:15.136 --> 17:17.002
She knew something that Stefan
didn't want her to know,

17:17.003 --> 17:18.671
and for some screwed up reason,

17:18.672 --> 17:20.673
you're obsessed with
knowing Stefan's secrets.

17:20.674 --> 17:22.608
Probably because he has
everything you'll never have.

17:22.609 --> 17:24.109
Answer the bloody question.

17:24.111 --> 17:25.645
Why are you helping me?

17:25.646 --> 17:27.046
Because I want this
obsession to take you

17:27.047 --> 17:29.315
the hell away from here.

17:29.316 --> 17:30.483
This is all
the information Monique

17:30.484 --> 17:31.951
told me about her past.

17:31.952 --> 17:34.453
Take it and get out.

17:38.558 --> 17:39.925
Heh heh.

17:43.296 --> 17:45.865
Think I didn't plan for that?

17:45.866 --> 17:47.399
Agh!

18:06.479 --> 18:09.114
Caroline could really use
whatever's in that cup.

18:12.451 --> 18:15.054
Is it just me,
or does that look really bad

18:15.055 --> 18:17.755
for somebody who just fainted?

18:17.757 --> 18:21.227
That doctor just
came over from radiology.

18:21.228 --> 18:25.451
I overheard her say
glioblastoma.

18:26.433 --> 18:32.159
Glioblastoma?
No, but that... no.

18:32.160 --> 18:34.039
No, no.

18:34.040 --> 18:37.209
We brought her in
a couple of weeks ago

18:37.210 --> 18:38.777
after Tripp's guys grabbed here.

18:38.778 --> 18:42.047
Doctors ran some tests,
and apparently they found

18:42.048 --> 18:43.549
something suspicious.

18:43.550 --> 18:45.384
No, but that doesn't
make sense, Stefan.

18:45.385 --> 18:46.885
Caroline would have
said something.

18:46.886 --> 18:49.487
Or maybe her mom
hasn't told her yet.

18:52.724 --> 18:54.593
What's going on with Liz Forbes?

18:54.594 --> 18:58.230
Her recent MRI showed
a lesion on her brainstem.

18:58.231 --> 19:00.933
We think it's
metastasized to her spine.

19:00.934 --> 19:02.734
C-c-can you operate?

19:02.735 --> 19:05.269
If the tumor's already spread,
it would be impossible.

19:06.471 --> 19:08.005
But that would mean...

19:10.075 --> 19:12.144
Does she know?

19:12.145 --> 19:13.645
For a few weeks now,

19:13.646 --> 19:16.514
but news like this
takes time to digest.

19:25.624 --> 19:28.059
Ugh. Wou wn't it be
a billion times easier

19:28.060 --> 19:30.261
just to stake him in the heart?

19:30.262 --> 19:33.531
Yeah, but he wouldn't suffer.

19:33.532 --> 19:34.833
Get the door.

19:34.834 --> 19:36.634
Wait. This isn't
about making him suffer.

19:36.635 --> 19:38.470
It's about making sure he
doesn't kill anyone else.

19:38.471 --> 19:40.171
He just killed
an innocent girl, Jer.

19:40.172 --> 19:42.073
He deserves to suffer.

19:42.074 --> 19:43.742
Dude, you sound like Tripp.

19:43.743 --> 19:45.443
You mean the guy whose
neck Enzo slit open

19:45.444 --> 19:47.077
for trying to protect
innocent people?

19:47.079 --> 19:49.514
I'm just saying you're
being a little intense.

19:49.515 --> 19:50.849
Maybe that's the problem, Jer.

19:50.850 --> 19:52.317
We've all been looking
the other way

19:52.318 --> 19:53.618
because we're friends
with vampires,

19:53.619 --> 19:55.086
but how many people need to die

19:55.087 --> 19:56.788
for us to face the fact
that vampires

19:56.789 --> 19:58.033
also kill people?

19:58.034 --> 19:59.557
So what, you'd do
the same thing to Stefan?

19:59.558 --> 20:01.868
What about Elena or Caroline?

20:01.869 --> 20:03.727
Just help me get him to the van.

20:03.729 --> 20:05.630
Look. I know how you feel.

20:05.631 --> 20:08.420
I was supernaturally programmed
to take out my sister, remember,

20:08.967 --> 20:11.002
but this whole
us versus them thing

20:11.003 --> 20:12.369
is gonna drive you crazy,

20:12.371 --> 20:14.324
and it's gonna get you killed.

20:21.412 --> 20:24.315
Hey. It will be ok.

20:24.316 --> 20:27.217
Just needed to get rid of Kai
so you could free me.

20:29.020 --> 20:33.423
Look, Jo. You can't
run away from this anymore.

20:33.425 --> 20:35.976
You've had 18 years of freedom.

20:35.977 --> 20:39.697
Now take your magic back
and do this.

20:39.698 --> 20:41.198
You owe it to the coven.

20:41.199 --> 20:43.501
Is that what you think,

20:43.502 --> 20:44.969
that I've been shirking
my responsibility

20:44.970 --> 20:46.344
to our family?

20:46.345 --> 20:49.173
Luke's all I've got.

20:49.174 --> 20:51.233
If we merge and he dies...

20:53.577 --> 20:55.797
I may as well be dead, too.

20:55.798 --> 20:57.815
If Kai merges with me,

20:57.816 --> 21:00.768
he'll be more powerful
than any of us.

21:02.930 --> 21:05.523
Did it ever occur
to you that maybe

21:05.524 --> 21:07.290
you're strong enough
to beat him?

21:08.093 --> 21:12.129
You were 22 the last time
you went up against him.

21:12.130 --> 21:13.907
Since then, you've
been a combat medic,

21:14.704 --> 21:16.786
you've saved hundreds of lives,

21:17.696 --> 21:19.340
and your hospital worships you.

21:20.338 --> 21:22.439
Someone's done her research.

21:22.440 --> 21:24.250
You're my sister,

21:26.077 --> 21:27.526
and I'm yours.

21:29.280 --> 21:32.386
Look how far you've
come without magic.

21:33.117 --> 21:34.718
You didn't get here
listening to people

21:34.719 --> 21:36.485
tell you you weren't
strong enough.

21:39.990 --> 21:41.773
- Aah!
- Liv!

21:41.774 --> 21:43.627
Can't say I didn't warn her.

21:48.265 --> 21:50.634
Phesmatos superous em animi...

21:50.635 --> 21:52.135
Aah!

21:52.136 --> 21:54.538
Kai, stop!

21:54.539 --> 21:56.440
Isn't it gonna be funny
when I kill her

21:56.441 --> 21:57.874
using her own magic?

21:57.875 --> 21:59.743
Wait. Is that funny or sad?

21:59.744 --> 22:01.072
I get my emotions mixed up.

22:02.380 --> 22:03.780
Hey. What's the one
for fire again?

22:03.781 --> 22:05.015
It's "incendia," right?

22:05.016 --> 22:07.617
Phesmatos...

22:07.618 --> 22:10.654
Kai, enough!

22:10.655 --> 22:13.275
Lectos espiritox.

22:18.228 --> 22:19.929
That's it?
We're gonna kill bad guys together,

22:19.930 --> 22:20.964
and you're not gonna talk to me?

22:20.965 --> 22:22.866
Look. You blew up your car,

22:22.867 --> 22:24.267
you needed a ride.

22:24.268 --> 22:25.735
Doesn't mean we have to talk.

22:25.736 --> 22:27.437
All right. Look.
I agree

22:27.438 --> 22:30.106
that maybe compelling you
to betray your lady friend

22:30.107 --> 22:31.657
was an irrational
decision stemming

22:31.658 --> 22:33.951
from untreated control issues.

22:37.147 --> 22:39.315
- Heh. Ok.
- What?

22:43.084 --> 22:44.709
I'm sorry, Ric.

22:45.222 --> 22:46.428
Is that it?

22:48.192 --> 22:49.659
Yeah.

22:49.660 --> 22:51.724
Great. Let's finish this.

23:17.220 --> 23:19.318
There it is.

23:22.058 --> 23:24.427
Oh, so predictable.

23:24.428 --> 23:28.364
I threaten Liv, you do anything
it takes to save Liv.

23:28.365 --> 23:29.864
Fractos.

23:49.518 --> 23:51.286
Unh!

23:51.288 --> 23:53.122
Cemetery, really?

23:53.123 --> 23:55.124
Motus.

23:55.125 --> 23:57.693
Aah! Ugh.

23:57.694 --> 23:59.895
Oh, whoops.

23:59.896 --> 24:02.631
Looks like you found
the antimagic border.

24:02.632 --> 24:06.101
Drew a line in the dirt for
everyone's convenience. See?

24:06.102 --> 24:07.422
Yeah. You're welcome.

24:09.239 --> 24:11.140
Thank you.
Kill him.

24:11.141 --> 24:12.860
Alaric, don't!

24:13.576 --> 24:14.775
What are you talking about?

24:14.777 --> 24:16.011
She's lightheaded and confused.

24:16.012 --> 24:17.246
I'll give her some
of my blood, ok?

24:17.247 --> 24:18.480
Kill him.

24:18.481 --> 24:20.082
No, you can't.

24:20.083 --> 24:22.551
If Kai dies, Liv and Luke
have to do the merge.

24:22.552 --> 24:23.952
It's not fair to them.

24:23.953 --> 24:25.754
Who cares? Kill him.

24:25.755 --> 24:27.054
Ric, don't.

24:27.056 --> 24:29.956
I can win.
I can beat Kai.

24:30.426 --> 24:32.728
I just need a little
time to get stronger.

24:32.729 --> 24:34.162
We're moved truly.

24:34.163 --> 24:36.631
Kill him now.

24:36.632 --> 24:38.733
I'll figure out a way to win.

24:38.734 --> 24:40.902
Please you have to trust me.

24:40.903 --> 24:43.438
Keep him alive.

24:43.439 --> 24:44.972
Ric.

24:53.281 --> 24:55.581
Why the hell did you
tell Damon where they were?

24:55.582 --> 24:58.851
Because I realized listening
to you two was a huge mistake.

24:58.852 --> 25:00.552
Kai's a monster.

25:00.553 --> 25:02.287
So you'll just risk
your sister's life?

25:02.288 --> 25:04.323
How the hell does
that make sense?

25:04.324 --> 25:06.358
Hey! I'm talking to you.

25:06.359 --> 25:08.193
Everyone, chill!

25:08.194 --> 25:09.628
Jo thinks she can beat Kai.

25:09.629 --> 25:12.296
You and I both know that's crap.

25:12.298 --> 25:15.701
Kai's a million times stronger.

25:15.702 --> 25:17.436
She'll die, and the first thing

25:17.437 --> 25:20.172
Kai's gonna do is kill
everyone in our coven

25:20.173 --> 25:22.374
as punishment for
putting him away,

25:22.375 --> 25:24.076
and then he'll turn
on innocent people

25:24.077 --> 25:27.546
because he's crazy
and bored and homicidal.

25:27.547 --> 25:29.715
Fine. Then I'm selfish, Luke,

25:29.716 --> 25:31.616
but I'd rather be alive
and selfish

25:31.617 --> 25:34.886
than this dead martyr
who served her purpose to her coven.

25:34.887 --> 25:37.089
People are gonna die,

25:37.090 --> 25:39.191
and it's gonna be our fault.

25:39.192 --> 25:40.524
Remember that.

25:57.175 --> 26:00.178
Are you ok?

26:00.179 --> 26:03.248
There's a 22-year-old
sociopathic witch

26:03.249 --> 26:05.717
running around
Mystic Falls right now.

26:05.718 --> 26:08.720
That we have a plan for.

26:08.721 --> 26:12.451
We've dealt with every
kind of evil there is,

26:12.452 --> 26:14.878
and we always have a plan,

26:15.828 --> 26:17.531
but this...

26:19.398 --> 26:21.894
If Caroline loses her mom,

26:22.601 --> 26:25.845
- it'll destroy her.
- I know.

26:27.673 --> 26:31.553
She doesn't deserve this, Elena.
She's a good person.

26:32.578 --> 26:35.501
- She's happy, she's kind.
- I know.

26:39.083 --> 26:41.519
I should tell her.

26:41.520 --> 26:44.889
It's only a matter of time
before she compels a doctor,

26:44.890 --> 26:48.793
and I don't want her finding
out from a stranger, you know?

26:48.794 --> 26:50.795
Let me do it.

26:50.796 --> 26:52.964
No, Stefan.
You don't have to.

26:52.965 --> 26:55.666
Let Damon know.
I should tell Caroline.

26:55.667 --> 26:58.502
I haven't been there for her.

26:58.503 --> 27:03.307
Caroline needed me,
and I ran away.

27:03.308 --> 27:07.047
So... yeah, I have to do it.

27:13.428 --> 27:15.419
I guess we'll just
lock up your brother

27:15.420 --> 27:17.922
until you two, you know...

27:17.923 --> 27:20.874
Merge our twin powers during
the next celestial event?

27:20.875 --> 27:23.397
Yeah. There really is no
sugarcoating that, is there?

27:24.830 --> 27:27.964
For the record,
I've dated doctors and lawyers

27:27.966 --> 27:30.000
and a couple of artist types,

27:30.001 --> 27:31.435
but none of my
previous boyfriends

27:31.436 --> 27:33.771
would have ever understood that.

27:33.772 --> 27:35.873
Heh.

27:35.874 --> 27:37.907
Here. Let me, uh...

27:52.800 --> 27:54.824
Be careful.

27:58.195 --> 27:59.763
So this whole antimagic thing,

27:59.764 --> 28:03.467
is it like a...
Like a dome or a bubble?

28:03.468 --> 28:06.103
Like, say, you were in 747
flying over Mystic Falls,

28:06.104 --> 28:07.371
would you die?

28:07.372 --> 28:08.639
You know, that could
be dangerous,

28:08.640 --> 28:10.140
like if you're headed
to New York

28:10.141 --> 28:12.943
and your pilot
reroutes for weather.

28:12.944 --> 28:14.945
How's this? I kill you,
and when you're in hell,

28:14.946 --> 28:19.116
you can ask a bar full of dead
travelers, who cast the damn spell.

28:19.117 --> 28:20.750
That's a lot of travelers.

28:20.752 --> 28:23.252
Must be a pretty big spell.

28:26.456 --> 28:28.624
Like a really big spell.

28:31.161 --> 28:33.863
So big...

28:33.864 --> 28:38.767
It covers every inch
of an entire town.

28:48.812 --> 28:50.613
What the hell are you doing?

28:50.614 --> 28:52.248
I'm working on my knuckleball.

28:52.249 --> 28:54.584
We are keeping him alive, Damon.

28:54.585 --> 28:57.053
Can I ask why
we continuously compromise logic

28:57.054 --> 28:58.421
for some girl you just met?

28:58.422 --> 28:59.756
You know, I don't
know how I went

28:59.757 --> 29:01.558
so long without saying this,

29:01.559 --> 29:03.026
but you're a real dick.

29:03.027 --> 29:06.429
Bonnie's stuck over there
because of him.

29:06.430 --> 29:07.997
She's over there,
and I'm over here,

29:07.998 --> 29:09.799
and I hate myself for it.

29:09.800 --> 29:12.702
Yeah, and killing him
will make you feel better,

29:12.703 --> 29:14.637
so let's just stop
pretending for a second

29:14.638 --> 29:17.844
that this is about
anyone else but you.

29:21.180 --> 29:23.812
You should probably go
change that tire.

29:44.228 --> 29:48.368
Ok, tree.
Let's do this.

29:51.903 --> 29:56.440
Now that's what
I call a Christmas tree.

29:56.441 --> 29:59.176
Isn't that gorgeous?

29:59.177 --> 30:02.112
The holidays are all
about being with loves ones,

30:02.114 --> 30:06.417
and I think that's what makes this
tradition so special in our town.

30:06.418 --> 30:08.886
It's a reminder that
no matter where you turn

30:08.887 --> 30:10.454
you have a friend.

30:10.455 --> 30:11.522
Aw.

30:13.825 --> 30:15.993
Biggest mistake
of junior year...

30:15.994 --> 30:18.462
Including the boys
in secret santa.

30:18.463 --> 30:20.564
Stefan is officially
the worst gift giver.

30:20.565 --> 30:21.799
He got you a snow globe?

30:21.800 --> 30:23.234
Yeah, of Mystic Falls,

30:23.235 --> 30:24.668
as if I don't see
enough of this town

30:24.669 --> 30:26.237
every day as it is.

30:26.238 --> 30:27.872
Well, I love my bracelet.

30:27.873 --> 30:29.940
Of course you do because
I am good at secret santa,

30:29.941 --> 30:32.276
and I didn't purchase it
from a quick stop.

30:32.277 --> 30:33.510
Looks like someone is missing

30:33.511 --> 30:35.112
the true meaning of Christmas.

30:35.113 --> 30:37.618
Come on. We're happy
and healthy,

30:37.619 --> 30:39.315
and we're together.

30:49.326 --> 30:50.694
Hey.

30:50.695 --> 30:52.663
Hey. Uh, there's no news.

30:52.664 --> 30:55.565
Apparently, they're
still running tests.

30:59.352 --> 31:03.318
Caroline, we need to talk.

31:09.846 --> 31:12.224
Hey. Where are you?
I can't hear you.

31:12.225 --> 31:14.551
I'm at the medical center.

31:14.552 --> 31:16.887
Where are you?

31:16.888 --> 31:18.654
Reception's horrible.

31:18.656 --> 31:22.389
- Damon, can you hear me?
- Hey. Elena!

32:10.996 --> 32:13.843
Fancy something else?

32:13.844 --> 32:18.080
I always figured I'd bow out
to the Everly brothers or...

32:28.057 --> 32:30.593
He stopped talking.

32:30.594 --> 32:32.427
He never stops talking.

32:39.872 --> 32:44.206
Magia tollox de terras.

32:44.207 --> 32:46.776
Utera aso utox.

32:46.777 --> 32:48.544
What happened to his chains?

32:48.545 --> 32:50.145
Is he chanting?

32:50.147 --> 32:53.348
Utera aso utox.

33:10.799 --> 33:13.469
Magia tollox de terras.

33:13.470 --> 33:16.537
Utera aso utox.

33:36.458 --> 33:38.559
It's a Christmas miracle.

33:47.603 --> 33:50.072
You little magic sucker.

33:50.073 --> 33:54.030
Sucked up all that magic
from the traveler spell.

33:58.980 --> 34:01.883
Aah!

34:01.884 --> 34:03.417
A lot of magic.

34:11.456 --> 34:14.918
Gah! I really, really
hate that move.

34:15.860 --> 34:17.596
Ric!

34:17.597 --> 34:19.954
Hey. Come on.

34:21.616 --> 34:24.469
Take my damn hand, Ric.

34:24.471 --> 34:25.837
Come on.

34:29.475 --> 34:31.603
How are you not dead?

34:39.034 --> 34:40.518
If we've learned
anything from today,

34:40.520 --> 34:42.454
it's that we should
kill our enemies with haste.

34:42.455 --> 34:45.311
Then what are you waiting for?
Go ahead and kill me.

34:45.312 --> 34:47.292
I said enemies.

34:47.293 --> 34:49.076
Don't flatter yourself.

34:49.621 --> 34:51.688
What do you want, Enzo?

34:53.687 --> 34:55.132
You were right.

34:55.134 --> 34:57.836
I am jealous of Stefan.

34:57.837 --> 35:01.873
He has what I want...
Respect, family,

35:01.874 --> 35:04.071
girls he doesn't deserve.

35:04.700 --> 35:08.313
He throws it all away,
and yet still somehow

35:08.314 --> 35:10.648
manages to come out winning.

35:15.186 --> 35:17.956
You are going to help me
deplete every ounce

35:17.957 --> 35:19.909
of happiness from his life,

35:20.826 --> 35:23.495
and when there's nothing left,

35:23.496 --> 35:25.396
I'll decide if you get to live.

35:26.831 --> 35:28.700
Oh, and, uh,

35:28.701 --> 35:30.601
happy holidays.

35:32.337 --> 35:34.973
You mean home home?

35:34.974 --> 35:37.075
Ahh.

35:37.076 --> 35:39.167
Just walked through
the front door,

35:39.168 --> 35:40.979
which I start locking
now that Kai's

35:40.980 --> 35:42.614
supercharged and on the prowl.

35:42.615 --> 35:45.483
Let's just celebrate
the fact that we can go home.

35:45.484 --> 35:47.957
I could really use
some happy news right now.

35:48.419 --> 35:51.212
- Today sucked.
- I'm listening.

35:51.775 --> 35:54.608
So look. I don't
know what we were or are

35:54.609 --> 35:56.861
or what we're supposed to be,

35:56.862 --> 36:01.165
but all I know is
that today was pretty horrible,

36:01.166 --> 36:04.102
and I just...
I want to see you.

36:04.485 --> 36:06.437
I have something
I need to tell you.

36:06.438 --> 36:07.924
Come over.

36:08.707 --> 36:09.941
I'll cook you dinner,
and we'll talk

36:09.942 --> 36:11.542
about our crappy days.

36:15.013 --> 36:17.602
That just
doesn't make sense.

36:17.603 --> 36:20.060
My mom would have said
something to me.

36:20.061 --> 36:22.253
We were worried, so...

36:22.254 --> 36:25.122
Elena compelled one of
the doctors for information.

36:25.123 --> 36:27.925
Ok. So my mom has a brain tumor.

36:27.926 --> 36:30.828
Then we'll just give
her vampire blood.

36:30.829 --> 36:35.566
Caroline, do you think
that if our blood cured cancer

36:35.567 --> 36:37.902
we would have heard
about that by now?

36:37.903 --> 36:41.472
Fine. Then when are
they gonna operate?

36:41.473 --> 36:44.140
That's the problem.
They can't.

36:44.142 --> 36:47.811
Ok. Well, if they can't operate,

36:47.812 --> 36:49.647
then they'll give
her chemo, right?

36:49.648 --> 36:51.916
The tumor is growing
so fast the doctors

36:51.917 --> 36:54.217
don't think that will work.

36:54.219 --> 36:56.053
Well, then they're wrong

36:56.054 --> 36:59.223
because they don't know her.

36:59.224 --> 37:01.725
They don't know
how strong she is.

37:01.726 --> 37:05.086
I mean, she's gonna
get through this, Stefan.

37:11.935 --> 37:13.436
Right?

37:22.412 --> 37:25.548
It's ok.
It's all right.

37:55.712 --> 37:57.713
We miss you, Bonnie.

37:59.582 --> 38:01.517
I miss you guys.

38:57.106 --> 39:00.976
That's not possible.

39:04.147 --> 39:05.581
What?

39:05.582 --> 39:08.116
This was gone.

39:08.118 --> 39:09.552
I blew this up.

39:09.553 --> 39:12.421
Yeah? Well, you weren't
around to annoy me

39:12.422 --> 39:15.157
for the last 4 months,
so I had a bit

39:15.158 --> 39:17.093
of extra time on my hands.

39:17.094 --> 39:18.894
Ha!

39:18.895 --> 39:20.429
Think of it as a early

39:20.430 --> 39:24.729
merry Christmas/late
welcome back to life present.

39:27.436 --> 39:29.638
Ha ha ha! Thank you.

39:29.639 --> 39:32.107
Hey. Just, uh, do me a favor.

39:32.108 --> 39:33.441
Don't die again.

39:33.443 --> 39:36.902
Those fenders were
a real bitch to find.

39:38.248 --> 39:39.614
Deal.

39:41.650 --> 39:43.084
Deal.

39:44.620 --> 39:48.290
Ha! Yeah.

39:52.094 --> 39:56.183
- Well, we're home.
- Yep.

39:57.786 --> 40:01.203
- You sticking around?
- Well, that depends.

40:01.204 --> 40:02.604
Might have to kill
Jeremy if I find out

40:02.605 --> 40:04.705
that he slept in my bed.

40:30.398 --> 40:33.701
Mistletoe. Clever.

40:35.370 --> 40:40.141
Hello.
Anybody there?

40:40.142 --> 40:42.109
Damon, what are you doing?

40:49.938 --> 40:53.087
Are you gonna let me in or...

40:55.523 --> 40:58.526
Um... heh.

40:58.527 --> 41:01.529
I may have put
a cloaking spell on us.

41:01.530 --> 41:03.363
How genius is that?
